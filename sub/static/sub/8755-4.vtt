00:10.630 --> 00:13.273
This is a guy who has
killed several people.

00:13.407 --> 00:16.277
She calls him "the big, scary man."

00:16.378 --> 00:18.011
Something grabbed my chest.

00:18.113 --> 00:20.013
My eyes were pitch-black.

00:20.115 --> 00:22.482
We're dealing with a demon.

00:22.584 --> 00:24.517
You don't mess with my kids.

00:24.619 --> 00:27.086
"I'm gonna tear your [Bleep] apart."

00:27.188 --> 00:30.723
Bad, bad little girl.

00:30.825 --> 00:33.259
There's a dark presence.

00:33.361 --> 00:35.328
My name is Amy Allan.

00:35.413 --> 00:37.330
These things, they're freaking out.

00:37.432 --> 00:38.498
They're from hell.

00:38.600 --> 00:39.565
I see dead people.

00:39.665 --> 00:40.864
They were being hunted.

00:40.966 --> 00:42.599
I speak to dead people.

00:42.701 --> 00:44.501
They were setting people on fire,

00:44.603 --> 00:45.602
burning them alive.

00:45.704 --> 00:46.736
And they speak to me.

00:46.838 --> 00:47.971
Her neck got broken.

00:48.073 --> 00:51.229
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:51.329 --> 00:53.229
I hear a gunshot.

00:53.331 --> 00:54.504
I rely on my partner.

00:54.604 --> 00:56.204
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

00:56.306 --> 00:58.006
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

00:58.108 --> 00:59.174
Something's not right here.

00:59.276 --> 01:02.544
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:02.646 --> 01:03.611
It's not safe here.

01:03.714 --> 01:05.080
It's my job to reveal them.

01:05.182 --> 01:06.314
Are any of them buried on the property?

01:06.416 --> 01:07.515
They're all buried here.

01:07.617 --> 01:09.984
But Steve and I never speak...

01:10.087 --> 01:12.020
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:12.122 --> 01:13.054
Until the very end...

01:13.156 --> 01:14.356
I can't do it no more.

01:14.458 --> 01:16.758
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:16.860 --> 01:18.626
Holy [Bleep] Look at this.

01:18.729 --> 01:19.894
Or time to get out.

01:19.996 --> 01:21.563
It does not have a happy ending.

01:21.665 --> 01:23.832
Something kills people here.

01:37.798 --> 01:40.115
I'm out here in the small
town of Lake Jackson, Texas.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.533
It's about an hour south of Houston.

01:41.651 --> 01:43.852
I got called in by a mother of four.

01:43.987 --> 01:45.954
Now, she sounded bad,

01:46.056 --> 01:49.724
says whatever's in the house
is torturing her family.

01:49.860 --> 01:52.460
They've been pushed, scratched, bruised,

01:52.596 --> 01:54.779
and had things thrown at them.

01:54.898 --> 01:57.499
She's fighting mad and
says if we can't help her,

01:57.584 --> 02:00.435
someone's gonna get seriously hurt.

02:03.240 --> 02:04.806
Before Amy arrives,

02:04.908 --> 02:07.976
I clear the area of
any leading information.

02:08.078 --> 02:10.645
Photographs, personal items,

02:10.729 --> 02:13.815
and names throughout this house
need to be covered or removed.

02:13.900 --> 02:17.252
When I'm done, the location
will be ready for tonight's walk.

02:28.932 --> 02:32.066
There's this little
girl, and she comes out.

02:32.169 --> 02:33.468
And her name's Casey.

02:33.570 --> 02:34.969
And she has long blonde hair,

02:35.071 --> 02:37.972
and she's, like, got
this little dress on.

02:38.058 --> 02:40.341
Uh, she's probably
like 8 or 9 years old,

02:40.427 --> 02:44.012
and she said, "If you
don't believe in God,

02:44.147 --> 02:47.248
you're dead and going to Hell."

02:47.350 --> 02:48.750
So as she's, like, saying that,

02:48.852 --> 02:52.987
she, like, gets all demonic-looking.

02:53.089 --> 02:56.291
And then, this creepy guy comes up.

02:56.376 --> 02:58.893
And he looks like seven-foot,

02:58.995 --> 03:01.429
like, trying to be
intimidating and scary.

03:01.531 --> 03:03.164
This guy

03:03.250 --> 03:08.520
is definitely interacting
with several people here.

03:08.605 --> 03:11.806
I think this is a guy who
has killed several people.

03:19.986 --> 03:22.150
So, Lisa, when
we spoke on the phone,

03:22.235 --> 03:24.869
you sounded scared, but you
also sounded really angry.

03:24.988 --> 03:25.987
It's hard.

03:26.072 --> 03:28.673
It's really hard, and
it gets harder every day.

03:28.792 --> 03:32.644
I just want to, like, break
down and cry and scream,

03:32.762 --> 03:34.662
but if I lose it, my kids'll lose it.

03:34.764 --> 03:36.431
We're done, you know? We're done.

03:36.516 --> 03:38.500
This is our final straw.

03:38.585 --> 03:42.437
All of our eggs are in this basket.

03:42.539 --> 03:45.773
So who exactly lives here with you?

03:45.876 --> 03:48.226
We have my partner, Jennifer;

03:48.345 --> 03:51.346
my son Gary Paul; my daughter Victoria;

03:51.448 --> 03:54.883
my daughter Jillian; my
son Ayden; and myself.

03:54.968 --> 03:56.221
You have a special-needs child?

03:56.321 --> 03:57.537
- It's Victoria.
- Victoria.

03:57.655 --> 03:59.755
- And how old is Victoria?
- 11.

03:59.858 --> 04:02.141
- What is her special need?
- She has Down syndrome.

04:02.227 --> 04:02.639
Okay.

04:02.739 --> 04:05.790
Give me an idea of exactly
what's happening in the house.

04:05.876 --> 04:10.145
It started out with doors
opening, doors closing.

04:10.247 --> 04:12.714
Then, it was, like, noises.

04:12.816 --> 04:17.303
Now we're seeing
apparitions, shadow people,

04:17.403 --> 04:18.885
and it's getting physical.

04:19.004 --> 04:20.170
You know, I can't tell my kids,

04:20.305 --> 04:22.976
"Don't be scared of the dark,"
because I'm scared of the dark.

04:23.076 --> 04:25.977
I'm scared of everything that we see.

04:26.112 --> 04:28.946
I'm scared of what's gonna happen next.

04:29.398 --> 04:32.449
You know, you just don't
feel like you're ever alone.

04:32.584 --> 04:35.001
You feel like you're
being watched constantly.

04:35.120 --> 04:39.823
You know, it's like,
"Am I losing my mind?"

04:39.908 --> 04:41.358
Just looking at you, I can see

04:41.443 --> 04:42.926
it's taken an emotional toll on you.

04:43.028 --> 04:44.060
Yeah.

04:44.146 --> 04:47.664
It's also taken a toll,
like, on my health.

04:47.766 --> 04:49.716
I have anxiety.

04:49.801 --> 04:51.134
My chest is tightening.

04:51.270 --> 04:53.803
Migraines, depression.

04:53.905 --> 04:58.224
I constantly feel like
I'm having a panic attack

04:58.310 --> 04:59.509
in my own house.

04:59.645 --> 05:01.695
- Have you been to the doctor?
- Been to the doctor.

05:01.813 --> 05:03.672
They don't know why I'm having it.

05:03.772 --> 05:05.422
I'm getting my ass kicked, you know?

05:05.524 --> 05:10.494
And I feel like I'm fighting
a battle I can't win.

05:10.596 --> 05:15.565
Somebody's [Bleep] a
lot of [Bleep] pain.

05:15.701 --> 05:18.819
I keep getting illness,
just constant illness.

05:18.904 --> 05:20.170
Sick, sick, sick.

05:22.741 --> 05:25.008
High blood pressure, cancer, migraines,

05:25.094 --> 05:26.927
possibly, like, heart issues.

05:27.045 --> 05:28.845
I feel sick to my stomach.

05:31.717 --> 05:33.917
I'm feeling like that
creepy man is, like,

05:34.019 --> 05:38.388
standing right behind me and,
like, breathing on my neck.

05:43.028 --> 05:45.762
I don't usually get creeped
out, but I'm kind of creeped out.

05:55.356 --> 05:56.755
So, Lisa, why'd you bring me in here?

05:56.857 --> 05:59.158
This is my 4-year-old
daughter Jillian's room,

05:59.293 --> 06:00.726
and she's had experiences.

06:00.828 --> 06:02.127
Okay. Like what?

06:02.213 --> 06:03.495
She was about a year and a half old.

06:03.631 --> 06:07.299
And I was getting her
dressed, and the door opened.

06:07.385 --> 06:10.469
And she turned and looked
at it and said, "Oh, no.

06:10.554 --> 06:12.254
Not you again."

06:12.373 --> 06:14.340
That was her first, like, full sentence.

06:14.425 --> 06:16.291
What else has she experienced in here?

06:16.377 --> 06:19.895
She has been pulled out of her bed.

06:19.981 --> 06:21.180
So what happened?

06:21.315 --> 06:26.685
She was asleep up here,
and she was out cold.

06:26.787 --> 06:30.656
And then, there was this
loud bang and crying.

06:30.791 --> 06:32.875
I come in.

06:32.994 --> 06:34.243
Jillian's on the floor.

06:34.328 --> 06:35.627
And there was, like,

06:35.730 --> 06:40.582
these lines in the bed
like she had been pulled.

06:40.668 --> 06:42.301
She had nightmares where
she jumps out of bed

06:42.403 --> 06:43.318
or anything like that?

06:43.404 --> 06:45.137
- Seizures?
- Mnh-mnh.

06:45.272 --> 06:48.140
There's really no explanation.

06:48.275 --> 06:51.010
This would kill me, as a
father, to have to hear this.

06:51.112 --> 06:52.344
It's rough.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.630
Your room is supposed to be
your spot, your safe zone,

06:54.715 --> 06:56.815
your comfort zone.

06:56.901 --> 06:59.318
Well, this kid's 4 years old, and
she's been through a lot already.

06:59.403 --> 07:01.353
Is it affecting her in any way?

07:01.439 --> 07:04.406
She just, like, gets, like,

07:04.492 --> 07:09.094
these anger rages, like,
mood swings like a teenager.

07:09.196 --> 07:12.131
I'm just pissed because I can't stop it.

07:12.233 --> 07:13.599
You know, it's, like
You can't stop it.

07:13.684 --> 07:15.651
You can't see it. You can't fight it.

07:19.774 --> 07:25.226
I just hear crying,
crying... weeping, sobbing.

07:25.326 --> 07:26.892
It's, like, in the walls.

07:27.028 --> 07:29.795
Bad, bad little girl.

07:29.897 --> 07:33.766
All the time, getting in
trouble, acting out, being bad.

07:33.868 --> 07:39.305
Something's making
her do these things...

07:39.407 --> 07:43.075
and I think she is possessed
by the dead little girl.

07:43.177 --> 07:44.910
It's bad. It's really bad.

07:45.013 --> 07:46.712
It's really bad.

07:49.517 --> 07:51.817
The other living people
here think it's, um, like,

07:51.953 --> 07:53.252
night terrors.

07:53.337 --> 07:56.255
I don't know if they know
how dire it is, actually.

08:02.997 --> 08:04.296
Well, Lisa, to be honest with you,

08:04.399 --> 08:06.399
I was hoping you weren't
gonna take me into this room.

08:06.501 --> 08:07.850
- This is Tori's room, right?
- Mm-hmm.

08:07.969 --> 08:09.802
This is your daughter
with Down syndrome.

08:09.904 --> 08:11.187
Right.

08:11.272 --> 08:13.355
So obviously, she's going
through something in here.

08:13.441 --> 08:14.690
Definitely.

08:14.776 --> 08:19.845
We've had toys that
go off by themselves.

08:19.947 --> 08:23.215
She's mentioned that she has
seen a little girl in here

08:23.301 --> 08:25.184
that plays with her toys.

08:25.269 --> 08:26.802
Okay. Does anything else go on in here?

08:26.921 --> 08:31.524
She has told me that
there is a big...

08:31.609 --> 08:34.693
She calls him "the big, scary man."

08:34.761 --> 08:40.433
And he stands here in
her room, and he yells.

08:40.518 --> 08:42.601
Did she describe him to you?

08:42.687 --> 08:45.271
It's kind of hard for her because,

08:45.406 --> 08:49.508
like, unfortunately, mentally,
she's around like 3, 4.

08:49.594 --> 08:50.045
Right. Okay.

08:50.145 --> 08:54.047
And then, she also used
to have a chair in here.

08:54.149 --> 08:56.316
There was a man that sat in the chair

08:56.401 --> 08:57.434
and just watched her.

08:57.519 --> 09:00.186
He's a friggin' coward, is what he is.

09:00.272 --> 09:05.125
We would hear her at night
just screaming, you know,

09:05.260 --> 09:08.461
"Stop. Shut up. Leave me alone."

09:08.597 --> 09:10.597
Now, you're sure it wasn't
a nightmare she was having?

09:10.682 --> 09:11.865
No, she was awake.

09:11.950 --> 09:14.367
It's hard. It's gotten unbearable.

09:14.453 --> 09:16.732
I don't even know what we're gonna do.

09:16.832 --> 09:18.164
I need to know what I'm up against.

09:18.266 --> 09:20.016
I need to know how to get rid of it.

09:24.206 --> 09:27.524
I think this is the worst room.

09:28.500 --> 09:31.067
I see a girl, older.

09:31.203 --> 09:32.969
She's got, like, brown hair.

09:33.071 --> 09:38.975
Creepy dead guy is... influencing her.

09:39.888 --> 09:42.238
So we have the dead little girl

09:42.338 --> 09:44.772
who's influencing that
person in that room...

09:47.058 --> 09:52.377
and the dead creepy guy
who's influencing this girl.

09:52.954 --> 09:58.240
I've never seen dead people,
two in the same place,

09:58.359 --> 10:00.809
trying to [Bleep] possess kids.

10:00.895 --> 10:04.797
I don't know. That
seems suspicious to me.

10:04.899 --> 10:12.738
This one's way more influenced
than that one so far.

10:12.840 --> 10:14.373
She's way gone.

10:38.908 --> 10:39.873
So why don't you tell me

10:39.975 --> 10:41.341
about some of the
experiences you're having?

10:41.443 --> 10:43.570
I don't really remember it,

10:43.670 --> 10:50.341
but my mom told me that,
uh, I got up out of my bed.

10:50.443 --> 10:52.210
And my eyes were pitch-black,

10:52.295 --> 10:54.979
and I started attacking her.

10:55.065 --> 10:56.514
I don't remember anything.

10:56.599 --> 10:57.982
How old were you when this happened?

10:58.084 --> 10:59.217
12 or something.

10:59.352 --> 11:00.702
You're 13 now?

11:00.787 --> 11:02.120
Yeah, almost 14.

11:02.205 --> 11:04.439
When you were awake, have
you ever attacked your mother?

11:04.557 --> 11:05.690
No.

11:05.775 --> 11:08.376
That's my mom. You would
never attack your mom.

11:08.461 --> 11:10.561
- I mean, that's pretty strange.
- Mm-hmm.

11:10.697 --> 11:11.896
Anything else?

11:11.998 --> 11:15.349
One night in the summer,
I woke up freezing cold,

11:15.468 --> 11:16.968
and I looked at my shirt,

11:17.070 --> 11:19.937
and it was being pulled up like this.

11:20.023 --> 11:23.558
And then, when I stared at it,
it just went down like that.

11:23.676 --> 11:25.660
So it looked like something
was pulling on your shirt?

11:25.779 --> 11:26.986
- Yeah.
- And you were freezing?

11:27.086 --> 11:28.018
Were you sick?

11:28.104 --> 11:28.819
Did you have a fever
or anything like that?

11:28.921 --> 11:29.954
- No.
- Okay. Where were you?

11:30.056 --> 11:31.455
- Top bunk.
- Top bunk.

11:31.557 --> 11:33.591
Okay. Well, I got to tell you,

11:33.693 --> 11:35.276
I've heard a lot of
stories doing what I do now.

11:35.394 --> 11:36.861
This is pretty out there.

11:36.996 --> 11:38.195
Yeah.

11:38.281 --> 11:39.480
I mean, it's like something
you see in a movie.

11:39.565 --> 11:42.733
If it's really happening,
you guys got a problem.

11:50.476 --> 11:54.345
Bad. Ooh, it's so bad up there!

11:56.716 --> 11:59.116
Bad physical attack.

11:59.218 --> 12:00.784
It's all up there.

12:00.870 --> 12:02.970
Nothing down here, though.

12:03.089 --> 12:07.992
It's this creepy guy
yanking on their jaw.

12:14.784 --> 12:18.002
Yeah, this is [Bleep] nuts.

12:25.445 --> 12:26.878
So, Jennifer, I was talking to Lisa,

12:26.980 --> 12:30.798
and she told me that
you were a skeptic...

12:30.917 --> 12:32.750
- Yes.
- ...before you moved here.

12:32.886 --> 12:33.918
Very much so.

12:34.003 --> 12:35.820
Not anymore, though,
from what I understand.

12:35.905 --> 12:37.121
- No.
- Okay.

12:37.207 --> 12:38.456
So what changed your mind?

12:38.558 --> 12:41.418
Well, one night, my brother
Daniel came to me in a dream.

12:41.518 --> 12:43.235
- Your brother?
- Yes.

12:43.354 --> 12:45.254
He told me I need to
get Lisa and these kids

12:45.356 --> 12:46.788
out of this house.

12:46.891 --> 12:48.891
Okay, so I'm assuming
your brother passed.

12:48.959 --> 12:50.042
Yes.

12:50.127 --> 12:52.060
What happened, if you
don't mind me asking?

12:52.162 --> 12:56.999
He shot himself with
my grandfather's gun.

12:57.084 --> 12:59.401
Okay. Uh, how long ago was that?

12:59.470 --> 13:01.169
Well, it's been about 10 years.

13:01.255 --> 13:03.338
I have a picture of him right here.

13:07.144 --> 13:07.948
How old was he when he passed?

13:08.048 --> 13:09.648
- 24, 25.
- All right.

13:09.783 --> 13:12.300
- So he was young.
- He was young.

13:12.419 --> 13:13.752
What kind of guy was he?

13:13.854 --> 13:16.121
He would give the shirt
off his back for anybody

13:16.223 --> 13:17.889
that he loved and cared about.

13:17.975 --> 13:19.357
That had to be a tough loss.

13:19.493 --> 13:20.525
Mm-hmm.

13:20.594 --> 13:22.727
Lisa and him were friends.

13:22.813 --> 13:25.230
- Is that right?
- That's how I knew who Lisa was.

13:25.315 --> 13:28.900
She was the little girl
running around with my brother.

13:29.036 --> 13:30.202
Okay. That's interesting.

13:30.337 --> 13:31.720
So did he know the kids?

13:31.838 --> 13:35.941
He knew the boys, and
Tori was just a baby.

13:36.026 --> 13:37.142
Okay.

13:37.227 --> 13:39.010
I believe he's here,

13:39.096 --> 13:40.979
and I believe he's trying to protect us.

13:41.674 --> 13:42.923
It sounds like he gave you a warning.

13:43.009 --> 13:44.225
I believe so.

13:44.493 --> 13:45.559
Would you like to get
the hell out of here?

13:45.645 --> 13:46.744
- Yes.
- You would?

13:46.829 --> 13:48.112
In a heartbeat.

13:54.837 --> 13:58.005
I think that there's somebody here

13:58.107 --> 14:00.841
related to these people, I think,

14:00.943 --> 14:02.042
who live here,

14:02.178 --> 14:05.946
who killed himself...
shot himself in the head.

14:09.218 --> 14:11.719
I don't know if he did it here,

14:11.821 --> 14:14.989
but he's attached to them
somehow, and he's here.

14:15.091 --> 14:20.678
He's telling me that
this little girl, Casey,

14:20.763 --> 14:24.498
is evil and not to be trusted.

14:24.600 --> 14:25.849
He's concerned.

14:25.968 --> 14:28.752
I think he's concerned
about somebody here.

14:30.540 --> 14:35.243
He's trying to help, but he can't.

14:35.328 --> 14:38.946
He's, like, trying to intervene.

14:39.048 --> 14:42.750
But creepy guy...
he's got more power.

14:49.659 --> 14:51.392
There's a lot of
activity that happens in here.

14:51.494 --> 14:52.493
Okay. Tell me about some of it.

14:53.468 --> 14:56.503
Well, I was laying in
the middle of the bed,

14:56.605 --> 14:58.638
and Lisa was taking a hot shower.

14:58.740 --> 15:00.440
All of a sudden, I just seen a shadow,

15:00.575 --> 15:03.243
the steam coming out of the bathroom.

15:03.345 --> 15:04.678
It walked down the hallway.

15:04.780 --> 15:07.213
This shadow thing, did it
have an appearance of a human,

15:07.316 --> 15:08.415
or was it just a blob?

15:08.500 --> 15:11.017
It looked like, uh, I
guess like a tall man.

15:11.103 --> 15:12.185
Okay.

15:12.321 --> 15:14.154
Take the Marlboro man
and take his hat off.

15:14.289 --> 15:15.739
You guys taking any kind of drugs that

15:15.857 --> 15:17.407
are making you hallucinate a little bit?

15:17.526 --> 15:20.477
No. I've seen it several
times in our house.

15:20.562 --> 15:22.329
It comes and goes as it pleases.

15:22.464 --> 15:24.898
That's interesting. Anything else?

15:24.983 --> 15:27.233
Well, I was sleeping perfectly fine,

15:27.319 --> 15:30.537
and something grabbed my chest
and started pulling on me.

15:30.622 --> 15:32.322
And it lifted me up off the bed,

15:32.407 --> 15:34.808
and it was pulling me off the bed.

15:34.910 --> 15:36.626
And I kept fighting it and fighting it,

15:36.745 --> 15:38.895
and I couldn't get it off me.

15:39.014 --> 15:40.013
You sure it wasn't a dream?

15:40.098 --> 15:41.297
No, it wasn't a dream.

15:41.416 --> 15:44.401
Whatever it was stunk like death.

15:44.519 --> 15:45.902
Awful smell.

15:46.021 --> 15:48.121
I ended up passing out
from fighting it so hard.

15:48.256 --> 15:50.757
I just kind of collapsed.

15:50.842 --> 15:52.325
What happened to you the
next morning when you woke up?

15:52.411 --> 15:54.961
I had scratches and bruises on my chest.

15:55.030 --> 15:56.248
Did it happen again after that?

15:56.348 --> 15:58.281
It came back to me
about two weeks later,

15:58.400 --> 16:00.266
so I immediately asked,
"What's your name?"

16:00.402 --> 16:03.686
And it said, "My name's
Demas," and it left.

16:03.805 --> 16:05.271
- Demas?
- Demas.

16:05.357 --> 16:06.890
I tried researching
it and looking it up,

16:06.975 --> 16:08.558
and I couldn't find anything.

16:08.677 --> 16:10.176
How do you stay here if
there's something like that?

16:10.312 --> 16:13.496
'Cause I don't want to leave
her alone with the kids.

16:13.615 --> 16:17.050
Abandoning somebody
you love is not right.

16:17.152 --> 16:19.085
Okay.

16:22.691 --> 16:26.226
Okay. So crazy guy likes this room.

16:28.797 --> 16:31.531
He stomps around in
here, crawls on the bed.

16:31.633 --> 16:34.751
I see him, like... jumping.

16:34.836 --> 16:36.936
This big mother[bleep]
is jumping on their bed,

16:37.038 --> 16:38.404
you know?

16:38.506 --> 16:44.444
I feel like they feel, like,
this energy move through them.

16:44.546 --> 16:46.246
He wants to hit them.

16:46.348 --> 16:49.098
Only when there's two people in
the bed, he wants to hit them.

16:49.184 --> 16:50.450
I don't know if they've noticed

16:50.552 --> 16:53.653
if they sleep apart that they sleep,

16:53.755 --> 16:56.689
but if they're together,
all hell breaks loose.

16:56.775 --> 16:58.641
He doesn't like them.
He doesn't approve.

16:58.727 --> 17:02.695
This, you know, is
repulsive. They're disgusting.

17:02.797 --> 17:05.647
He says, "Those kinds of people just,

17:05.767 --> 17:08.401
uh, need to be wiped from
the face of the earth."

17:13.074 --> 17:16.843
I think that we're dealing with a demon.

17:16.928 --> 17:18.828
Comes from outside,
and it comes through.

17:18.914 --> 17:21.464
And I feel really dizzy, and I'm scared.

17:21.549 --> 17:24.233
This thing is really powerful.

17:24.352 --> 17:26.653
It's so angry, like, boom.

17:28.757 --> 17:34.294
The dead people do whatever
the demon wants them to do.

17:34.396 --> 17:37.664
So it's this demon that's
trying to possess the kids?

17:37.749 --> 17:40.700
Yes.

17:53.464 --> 17:54.628
As soon as I got to town,

17:54.728 --> 17:55.927
I called a bunch of locals trying to see

17:56.029 --> 17:57.795
if anyone could help me
out with my investigation.

17:57.897 --> 18:00.348
A local archaeologist
just called back and said

18:00.433 --> 18:03.434
one of the original owners of
Lisa and Jennifer's property

18:03.520 --> 18:06.654
has a wild and tragic story
that ended in bloodshed.

18:14.836 --> 18:16.436
So, Johnney, you mentioned on the phone,

18:16.555 --> 18:18.555
one of the original owners
of my client's property

18:18.657 --> 18:20.190
had an interesting story
I'm gonna want to hear about.

18:20.275 --> 18:21.608
Who was he?

18:21.727 --> 18:24.894
The original landowner was a
man by the name of Abner Jackson,

18:24.997 --> 18:28.715
and he was a planter that came
to Texas originally from Georgia

18:28.834 --> 18:31.618
and settled on this property.

18:31.737 --> 18:35.405
But at the time, he didn't
actually own the property.

18:35.490 --> 18:39.759
And through various
business deals, he was able

18:39.845 --> 18:44.147
to mortgage this property
owned by someone else

18:44.232 --> 18:48.585
to various people so that
he could acquire money

18:48.687 --> 18:51.988
to actually buy the property
from the original landowner.

18:52.074 --> 18:53.590
Okay. So this guy did a scam deal?

18:53.659 --> 18:54.658
- Correct.
- Okay.

18:54.760 --> 18:56.326
So we know this guy's a swindler.

18:56.411 --> 18:57.994
Do you know anything else about him?

18:58.130 --> 19:03.033
He married a wealthy
widow from South Carolina.

19:03.118 --> 19:05.001
Her name was Margaret.

19:05.087 --> 19:08.260
And Margaret and Abner
had five children.

19:08.360 --> 19:09.676
Okay.

19:09.762 --> 19:14.798
In 1857, things really begin
to become very interesting.

19:14.884 --> 19:19.636
Margaret dies, and Abner
takes this opportunity

19:19.722 --> 19:24.441
to bring the family
together and convinces them

19:24.577 --> 19:26.994
that they should not take
their mother's inheritance.

19:27.079 --> 19:28.896
So this guy swindled his kids, too?

19:29.014 --> 19:34.718
Correct. By 1860, he has 285 slaves,

19:34.803 --> 19:38.205
6,000 acres in three
different plantations,

19:38.324 --> 19:41.375
which makes him the
second-largest slave owner

19:41.460 --> 19:43.243
in the state of Texas.

19:43.362 --> 19:46.964
In 1861, the Civil War starts.

19:47.066 --> 19:50.133
The sons all go off to war,

19:50.219 --> 19:51.935
and at the end of the year,

19:52.037 --> 19:54.509
Abner Jackson comes down with malaria.

19:54.609 --> 19:56.049
And he dies.

19:57.478 --> 20:00.696
This demon... it
comes through the back,

20:00.782 --> 20:02.214
and it'll come right in.

20:02.300 --> 20:05.167
And I feel like there's
a lot of activity

20:05.286 --> 20:09.822
that happens in this area
because of this kind of path

20:09.924 --> 20:11.791
that this thing takes.

20:11.893 --> 20:15.795
When it comes in from
outside, it's angry.

20:15.897 --> 20:18.297
It's just like

20:18.382 --> 20:21.367
Goes, "I'm gonna [Bleep]
tear your [Bleep] apart."

20:26.040 --> 20:27.690
Oh, I don't feel good.

20:27.809 --> 20:30.709
It doesn't want me to come out here.

20:30.778 --> 20:32.178
It's like, "Don't you dare."

20:32.280 --> 20:36.148
Doesn't want me to go
there because we'll find it,

20:36.250 --> 20:39.819
and it feels very
threatened if we do that.

20:42.990 --> 20:44.690
It goes after weaknesses,

20:44.826 --> 20:46.909
whether it's physical
or emotional or mental.

20:46.994 --> 20:50.529
It finds it, and that's
how it makes you weak.

20:53.301 --> 20:56.435
I feel really sick and
weak right now, so...

21:00.274 --> 21:02.408
So what happens to the
plantation after Abner dies?

21:02.510 --> 21:07.279
The eldest son, John, gets
sick and returns from the war,

21:07.365 --> 21:12.218
and he operates the plantations,
all three properties,

21:12.353 --> 21:14.136
throughout the Civil War.

21:14.222 --> 21:15.654
Okay. So what about the other sons?

21:15.740 --> 21:17.925
Two of the sons died during the war.

21:18.025 --> 21:19.124
Okay.

21:19.209 --> 21:22.487
The third, George,
comes back after the war,

21:22.587 --> 21:27.156
and he wants his share
of his inheritance.

21:27.241 --> 21:29.669
John basically says, "Why
should I give you anything?"

21:29.695 --> 21:30.301
Okay.

21:30.395 --> 21:33.808
So they get into an argument
here on the plantation.

21:34.579 --> 21:37.347
John gets really upset with George,

21:37.482 --> 21:40.383
and he beats him with a whip.

21:41.686 --> 21:45.788
George sues for his
share of the inheritance.

21:45.924 --> 21:48.791
And he wins his case,

21:48.877 --> 21:50.729
and he gets the Lake Jackson plantation.

21:50.829 --> 21:52.896
So that means George gets the property

21:52.981 --> 21:55.065
that my client's house now sits on.

21:55.167 --> 21:56.233
That is correct.

21:56.318 --> 21:57.934
Did they live in harmony
after that, or what?

21:58.020 --> 21:59.503
No. No.

21:59.588 --> 22:02.339
In 1867, this came to a head.

22:02.441 --> 22:05.242
John came over to ask his brother

22:05.377 --> 22:07.878
to come in to a business deal with him.

22:07.980 --> 22:09.129
Okay.

22:09.214 --> 22:12.282
And George said, "No. I
don't want to do that."

22:12.417 --> 22:13.850
So they got into an argument.

22:13.952 --> 22:15.018
Okay.

22:15.103 --> 22:17.187
And John said,

22:17.289 --> 22:20.307
"Then I'm gonna whip you just
like I whipped you before."

22:20.425 --> 22:23.093
George loses it, pulls out a revolver,

22:23.178 --> 22:26.863
and at point-blank range shoots
John in the chest six times.

22:26.965 --> 22:28.715
He shoots him?

22:28.801 --> 22:30.634
- Kills him.
- All right.

22:30.719 --> 22:32.102
So did the shooting
actually happen right here

22:32.187 --> 22:33.270
- on the property?
- Yes, sir.

22:33.355 --> 22:34.437
It did.

22:34.540 --> 22:37.808
George is indicted, but
he's never brought to trial.

22:37.910 --> 22:41.411
He develops tuberculosis,
and he dies in Galveston.

22:41.497 --> 22:42.796
How old was he when he died?

22:42.881 --> 22:45.549
George was 29 years old when he died.

22:45.634 --> 22:47.250
Like Cain and Abel.

22:47.336 --> 22:51.154
Very much so.

22:51.256 --> 22:53.890
Creepy guy... He's not good.

22:53.992 --> 22:57.761
I think he killed
someone when he was alive.

22:57.846 --> 23:00.897
I think he might have
killed several people.

23:04.069 --> 23:05.836
Any idea when this was?

23:05.921 --> 23:12.075
I think that he was
from a long time ago,

23:12.177 --> 23:15.078
I think before these houses were built.

23:15.163 --> 23:17.998
And he owned this property, this land.

23:18.116 --> 23:22.819
And this is his property,
and what he says goes.

23:27.960 --> 23:29.159
If you need us to investigate

23:29.261 --> 23:31.028
unexplained activity in your home,

23:31.163 --> 23:34.131
go to the "Dead Files"
page at travelchannel.com.

23:34.233 --> 23:35.732
Click on "Help Me, Dead
Files!" to submit your story,

23:35.834 --> 23:36.800
and we'll help if we can.

23:44.829 --> 23:46.497
So far, I know
my client's property

23:46.597 --> 23:48.280
was home to hundreds of slaves

23:48.399 --> 23:50.482
and was the site of
a brutal family fight

23:50.567 --> 23:52.200
that ended in murder.

23:52.302 --> 23:54.903
But I need to see if
there's anything else

23:55.005 --> 23:57.072
that could help my case.

23:57.157 --> 23:58.340
Searching through old records,

23:58.442 --> 24:00.642
I find out after the
Jacksons sold the land,

24:00.728 --> 24:02.094
it became a prison camp.

24:03.910 --> 24:05.727
And the conditions there were terrible.

24:09.182 --> 24:11.549
I'm on my way to meet with
a former corrections officer

24:11.635 --> 24:13.535
who says that torture and
abuse were just the beginning

24:13.653 --> 24:15.320
of the story.

24:19.760 --> 24:21.893
So, Reginald, what'd you
find out about this prison camp?

24:21.979 --> 24:24.362
Well, after the Civil War,

24:24.448 --> 24:28.383
the state had to come up with
a way to get free labor back.

24:28.469 --> 24:32.420
And they came up with
this ingenious idea

24:32.539 --> 24:37.916
of using inmate labor as
another form of slave labor.

24:37.951 --> 24:39.184
So it was like slavery all over again.

24:39.253 --> 24:40.418
Exactly.

24:40.504 --> 24:44.637
So in 1872, the Jackson
family lost their property.

24:44.737 --> 24:45.636
Okay.

24:45.722 --> 24:46.971
And at the same time,

24:47.106 --> 24:50.157
it was a company called Ward and DeWitt.

24:50.276 --> 24:52.743
And the state said "We
have these individuals,

24:52.879 --> 24:54.666
and we need to farm them out."

24:54.766 --> 24:55.781
And that's what they did.

24:55.851 --> 24:59.901
They leased the prisoners from
this prison unit in Huntsville.

25:01.747 --> 25:03.313
So I read that the abuse
was pretty bad there.

25:03.787 --> 25:05.020
How bad did it get?

25:05.120 --> 25:07.237
They beat them. They scald them.

25:07.322 --> 25:08.438
They whooped them.

25:08.573 --> 25:11.908
These guys were dying from
scurvies and malnutrition,

25:11.994 --> 25:14.294
and it was just a terrible scene there.

25:14.379 --> 25:16.680
Basically treated like animals.

25:16.765 --> 25:18.181
Yes.

25:18.266 --> 25:21.501
It got so bad that these guys
would cut their fingers off

25:21.620 --> 25:23.653
to keep from having to work.

25:23.789 --> 25:26.289
Some would cut the
tendons in their ankles

25:26.391 --> 25:28.525
so that they wouldn't be able to walk.

25:28.627 --> 25:30.702
Left hand chopped off
to the second joint.

25:30.802 --> 25:33.236
Some even to the extreme of suicide.

25:33.338 --> 25:34.554
Wow.

25:34.673 --> 25:36.890
And when they would run, they
would be shot on the spot,

25:36.975 --> 25:39.476
and they didn't have the
decency to a proper burial.

25:39.578 --> 25:41.778
So they'd just turn over a little soil

25:41.914 --> 25:43.280
and put the dead body in there.

25:43.415 --> 25:45.699
And then, they continued
to move forward.

25:45.784 --> 25:46.867
Okay, so I can assume

25:46.952 --> 25:48.668
the property I'm
investigating has dead bodies

25:48.722 --> 25:49.892
from during this time period.

25:49.992 --> 25:51.758
No doubt.

25:55.964 --> 26:00.467
There's a man, like,
a man on the ground.

26:00.569 --> 26:03.937
His ear... his
ear hurts so bad.

26:06.441 --> 26:07.490
He worked nearby.

26:08.554 --> 26:11.889
He had to wear a uniform of some kind.

26:11.991 --> 26:13.891
Do you know what happened?

26:15.995 --> 26:18.362
It's dark.

26:18.464 --> 26:20.597
It's dirt and grass.

26:20.683 --> 26:22.700
I think people were chasing.

26:27.440 --> 26:30.341
He's very confused.

26:30.443 --> 26:33.777
I think he got attacked.

26:33.879 --> 26:35.262
Very, very painful death.

26:35.348 --> 26:38.215
Very, very [Bleep] painful death.

26:38.317 --> 26:39.717
He's dying. He's dying.

26:39.802 --> 26:41.618
He's dying.

26:43.789 --> 26:47.324
Ah!

26:47.460 --> 26:48.659
Oh There's a neck thing.

26:48.794 --> 26:50.861
Oh

26:57.420 --> 27:00.805
During my walk, I saw
several disturbing scenes,

27:00.890 --> 27:03.174
but the creepy guy
trying to posses the girl

27:03.259 --> 27:06.510
in the green room had
me the most concerned.

27:06.613 --> 27:09.380
There was a little
girl that was in the bed,

27:09.482 --> 27:13.901
and there was this thing next to her.

27:13.987 --> 27:17.855
It had big eyes, weird, bulging.

27:17.957 --> 27:20.808
And they were glowing, and its mouth

27:20.893 --> 27:25.129
was all of these really
sharp, like, teeth.

27:29.752 --> 27:30.918
Amy, is this what you saw?

27:32.939 --> 27:34.855
Yes. That's what I saw.

27:56.848 --> 27:59.375
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

27:59.475 --> 28:01.008
we're ready to reveal our findings

28:01.110 --> 28:04.061
to each other and our
clients for the first time.

28:04.180 --> 28:07.064
Well, Amy, I'd like you
to meet Lisa and Jennifer.

28:07.183 --> 28:08.415
They live in this house together

28:08.517 --> 28:11.151
and have been going through
a horrible time here.

28:11.253 --> 28:12.987
But that's not why they called us in.

28:14.924 --> 28:16.066
This is why they called us in.

28:16.166 --> 28:18.099
They're raising four
beautiful kids here.

28:18.201 --> 28:19.800
This is Gary Paul, who's 12.

28:19.903 --> 28:21.536
This is Ayden, who's 13.

28:21.638 --> 28:24.906
This is Victoria, who's
11, who has special needs.

28:25.041 --> 28:27.475
This is Jillian, who's
an adorable 4-year-old.

28:27.577 --> 28:28.910
These guys are desperate.

28:29.012 --> 28:30.228
They think the kids are in danger

28:30.313 --> 28:32.013
and have no idea how to fight it.

28:32.115 --> 28:34.248
Oh, how long have you all lived here?

28:34.350 --> 28:35.416
Five years.

28:35.552 --> 28:37.852
When did you start
noticing the strange things?

28:37.954 --> 28:39.620
Almost immediately.

28:39.689 --> 28:41.289
Okay.

28:41.391 --> 28:44.825
This was an extremely intense walk.

28:44.928 --> 28:49.313
I actually was frightened several times,

28:49.432 --> 28:54.151
and I very rarely get unnerved.

28:54.237 --> 28:57.705
When I first arrived, I saw this male,

28:57.840 --> 29:00.107
and he's a conscious dead person.

29:00.176 --> 29:03.010
I thought perhaps there was
some kind of relationship

29:03.112 --> 29:06.080
with somebody who's alive in the house.

29:06.165 --> 29:08.249
I thought maybe in his 30s,

29:08.334 --> 29:12.069
and I got that he killed himself
with a gunshot to the head.

29:15.158 --> 29:18.009
He's concerned about
somebody in the house.

29:18.127 --> 29:21.295
He's reliving his death over and over,

29:21.431 --> 29:24.532
and he's aware of what's
going on around him.

29:24.617 --> 29:26.450
And he's trying to help,

29:26.569 --> 29:33.708
but he's very limited because
he is in a lot of physical pain.

29:33.776 --> 29:37.078
And that makes it very
difficult for him to focus.

29:37.163 --> 29:39.747
I was hoping we wouldn't have
to discuss this at the table,

29:39.882 --> 29:42.500
but... Jennifer, if you don't mind,

29:42.619 --> 29:45.486
would you tell Amy about your brother?

29:45.571 --> 29:47.622
My brother committed suicide.

29:49.676 --> 29:55.229
And... how I met Lisa
was through my brother.

29:55.331 --> 29:57.081
They were best friends.

29:57.166 --> 30:00.201
He came to me in a
dream not too long ago

30:00.303 --> 30:04.739
and said I need to get Lisa
and the babies out of the house.

30:04.874 --> 30:06.657
You know, we had our suspicions,

30:06.776 --> 30:10.578
but it's just painful to
hear that he's not rested.

30:10.713 --> 30:14.582
It's been... a long time,

30:14.667 --> 30:17.218
and, you know, you just
want them to be at peace.

30:17.353 --> 30:19.654
And to find out he's not...

30:19.789 --> 30:23.708
It's very sad.

30:23.793 --> 30:26.594
He'd give the shirt off
his back for anybody.

30:26.679 --> 30:27.995
And he knew the kids.

30:28.081 --> 30:30.264
He was a protector.

30:30.350 --> 30:32.066
I want him to be at peace.

30:32.168 --> 30:34.502
I don't want him suffering or hurting.

30:37.607 --> 30:39.073
Anything else on your walk?

30:39.175 --> 30:43.311
I encountered another dead male,

30:43.413 --> 30:49.817
and I saw that he was
a very big problem here.

30:49.952 --> 30:55.289
I was seeing, like, this weird
dual personality with him,

30:55.391 --> 30:58.759
where it would be, like,
this is how he was in life.

30:58.861 --> 31:04.899
And then, he would morph into
this really awful-looking,

31:05.001 --> 31:10.004
creepy thing with these
teeth and these eyes.

31:10.089 --> 31:12.239
The first location

31:12.375 --> 31:17.528
that I saw there being incidents
was in the master bedroom.

31:17.613 --> 31:20.031
He's looking at the bed, and he's like,

31:20.149 --> 31:22.917
"I hate the people
who sleep in that bed."

31:25.521 --> 31:27.188
He said, "What they're
doing is sick and disgusting.

31:27.880 --> 31:29.122
Those kinds of people

31:29.222 --> 31:31.955
need to be wiped away from
the face of the earth."

31:33.040 --> 31:34.289
I felt that it's possible

31:34.408 --> 31:37.309
that the living might feel his attacks

31:37.395 --> 31:39.428
because he seems like a physical guy.

31:39.547 --> 31:42.948
Might feel him jumping on the bed.

31:43.050 --> 31:46.201
I was sleeping, and
something got on top of me

31:46.320 --> 31:48.671
and was, like, like, on my chest.

31:48.789 --> 31:51.073
- And I was trying to fight it.
- Mm-hmm.

31:51.158 --> 31:54.332
And then, I passed out,
but when I woke back up,

31:54.432 --> 31:56.532
there were scratches and
bruises all over my chest.

31:56.667 --> 31:57.616
Did it say anything?

31:57.702 --> 31:59.802
It said, "My name's Demas."

32:02.440 --> 32:03.772
And what other room'd
you see this guy attack?

32:03.875 --> 32:08.944
The second place that I saw
physical attacks going on

32:09.030 --> 32:11.497
was in the room with the bunk beds.

32:11.616 --> 32:13.616
That's Ayden's room.

32:13.718 --> 32:23.459
And what I saw in there was a
direct line from the nasty guy

32:23.561 --> 32:25.895
to the person in the top bunk.

32:25.980 --> 32:30.432
The creepy guy was trying to wake him up

32:30.518 --> 32:33.385
by taking his hand and
putting it in his mouth

32:33.471 --> 32:36.862
and, like, pulling on his jaw
and trying to make him talk.

32:36.962 --> 32:39.295
And it was... seemed
to be very direct,

32:39.381 --> 32:40.811
like, attack on this person.

32:40.911 --> 32:43.194
Tell Amy about the time
with Ayden where he woke up

32:43.294 --> 32:44.376
and the shirt was being pulled.

32:44.461 --> 32:46.161
He said that, like,

32:46.297 --> 32:50.732
his shirt was being pulled
out, away from his body,

32:50.818 --> 32:53.835
like somebody was pulling on it.

32:53.938 --> 32:54.937
Didn't he black out and attack you?

32:55.072 --> 32:56.088
He, all of a sudden,

32:56.207 --> 33:00.098
had, like, this
outburst of, like, anger.

33:00.198 --> 33:03.132
And he started hitting
me and kicking me.

33:03.251 --> 33:05.102
I don't know what happened,

33:05.202 --> 33:10.322
but that was not my son.

33:10.457 --> 33:13.375
Now, this thing you saw...
was this a person at one time?

33:13.460 --> 33:14.760
- Uh, yes.
- All right.

33:14.845 --> 33:16.712
So who is this [Bleep] You
know anything about them?

33:16.830 --> 33:18.363
He lived here a long time ago.

33:18.465 --> 33:20.432
He owned all this land.

33:20.534 --> 33:22.935
He was not a good man when he was alive

33:23.037 --> 33:24.803
and that I did, in fact, see him,

33:24.905 --> 33:27.506
like, kill a few people

33:27.591 --> 33:29.508
when he was alive.

33:29.593 --> 33:31.476
Well, it
reminds me of somebody

33:31.562 --> 33:33.528
that actually was one
of the original owners

33:33.647 --> 33:34.456
of the property.

33:34.633 --> 33:36.649
Now, back in the 1840s,
a guy named Abner Jackson

33:36.768 --> 33:38.601
settled onto the land with his family.

33:38.687 --> 33:40.620
This is Abner.

33:42.591 --> 33:43.923
Wow.

33:44.009 --> 33:45.475
The thing was this wasn't his land.

33:45.560 --> 33:49.245
What he did was he just settled
on it and pretended it was.

33:49.331 --> 33:52.015
And then, he mortgaged
it to other people,

33:52.117 --> 33:53.883
and with the money he got from them,

33:53.969 --> 33:59.255
he winds up owning over
6,000 acres and 3 plantations,

33:59.573 --> 34:01.397
285 slaves.

34:01.497 --> 34:04.962
He was the second-largest owner
of slaves in Texas at the time.

34:05.062 --> 34:07.930
1861, the war breaks out,

34:08.014 --> 34:11.103
and Abner's four sons go off to war.

34:11.203 --> 34:13.620
Now, about that time,

34:13.723 --> 34:16.389
Abner dropped dead of
malaria within two days,

34:16.475 --> 34:18.007
but he drops dead without a will.

34:18.094 --> 34:19.693
His oldest son, John, got sick,

34:19.779 --> 34:21.245
and they released him
on medical discharge.

34:21.364 --> 34:26.567
And he came back, took over, and
started running the plantation.

34:26.668 --> 34:28.873
I got a map that'll give you
an idea what I'm talking about.

34:28.908 --> 34:32.260
Your house is right about here.

34:32.362 --> 34:35.730
Plantation house was right about
here, where these marks are.

34:35.815 --> 34:38.132
So it's very short distance.

34:38.234 --> 34:41.002
During the war, two of
John's other brothers died.

34:41.103 --> 34:42.937
One other brother, George,
survived and came home,

34:43.022 --> 34:45.139
and he wanted a piece of the action.

34:45.241 --> 34:46.507
John told him, "Forget about it.

34:46.592 --> 34:47.675
You're not getting anything."

34:47.760 --> 34:49.143
John got to the point where they started

34:49.228 --> 34:50.811
a physical fight, and
he whipped his brother.

34:50.897 --> 34:54.348
So George sues him, and he wins.

34:54.434 --> 34:58.402
He gets the property you guys are on.

34:58.521 --> 35:00.788
Little time later, John
decides, "Well, you know,

35:00.924 --> 35:01.852
I got a business deal
for my brother, and I'm

35:01.952 --> 35:04.319
gonna try to hook him into
going into business with me."

35:04.421 --> 35:05.603
Comes over here with his horse,

35:05.722 --> 35:08.123
gets into an argument with him
right in front of the house.

35:08.258 --> 35:11.626
And George pulls out a gun
and shoots him six times

35:11.711 --> 35:13.461
right in the chest,
kills his own brother.

35:13.597 --> 35:15.363
Wow.

35:15.854 --> 35:17.470
You think George could
be this creepy guy?

35:17.589 --> 35:19.956
No. It's this guy.

35:22.628 --> 35:24.661
I just want to know what
his deal is with Ayden.

35:24.763 --> 35:27.480
He hates everyone.

35:31.870 --> 35:38.191
The next thing that happened
was I went into the green room.

35:38.277 --> 35:39.843
That's Tori's room.

35:39.928 --> 35:41.912
I saw a living girl
sitting up in the bed.

35:42.014 --> 35:46.216
That was another person
of interest for him,

35:46.318 --> 35:48.652
and she had dark-brown hair.

35:48.737 --> 35:53.440
He was trying to possess
her and take over her.

35:53.525 --> 35:54.758
This seemed to me that

35:54.843 --> 35:57.561
she's been influenced
pretty successfully by him.

35:57.663 --> 35:59.246
That is pretty far along.

35:59.364 --> 36:02.065
I thought that perhaps the
living would notice some changes

36:02.150 --> 36:06.303
to her personality or behaviors.

36:06.405 --> 36:10.090
The male that I met
earlier, your brother...

36:10.208 --> 36:14.778
he was extremely present in that room,

36:14.880 --> 36:16.913
trying to protect her,

36:16.999 --> 36:19.375
but the creepy guy is
much stronger than him.

36:19.975 --> 36:21.207
You look pretty pissed.

36:21.343 --> 36:23.109
I am.

36:23.211 --> 36:25.789
3:00 in the morning one night,

36:25.889 --> 36:27.755
I heard her saying,

36:27.857 --> 36:29.590
"Stop! Stop! Get off
me! You're hurting me!

36:29.726 --> 36:30.641
You're hurting me!"

36:30.727 --> 36:32.560
Didn't you tell me that she told you

36:32.645 --> 36:34.362
it was a big, scary man in there?

36:34.447 --> 36:38.699
She said he is a big, scary
man, and he yells all the time.

36:38.802 --> 36:42.603
Hmm. I did do a sketch of what I saw.

36:42.705 --> 36:43.871
This is kind of weird.

36:46.142 --> 36:47.742
Oh, geez.

36:53.500 --> 36:57.385
What the [Bleep]

36:57.470 --> 37:01.055
That would be the scary monster
Jill and Tori are seeing.

37:01.157 --> 37:04.025
No wonder our kids can't [Bleep] sleep.

37:04.110 --> 37:05.660
- They don't sleep.
- 'Specially Tori.

37:05.745 --> 37:07.261
You don't [Bleep] with my kids,

37:07.363 --> 37:10.031
and this [Bleep] needs
to get out of our house.

37:11.885 --> 37:13.335
I'm afraid to ask if
there was anything else.

37:13.470 --> 37:15.537
- But is there?
- Yes, there was.

37:15.639 --> 37:18.390
Then, I went into the pink bedroom,

37:18.475 --> 37:21.143
and things were not any better in there.

37:21.245 --> 37:23.378
So that's Jillian's room.

37:23.447 --> 37:25.197
What I heard was crying,

37:25.282 --> 37:28.049
weeping, and sobbing
from the living girl.

37:28.135 --> 37:29.835
I was getting that the living

37:29.920 --> 37:31.419
were thinking that
she was just being bad,

37:31.505 --> 37:33.605
but she was really also being influenced

37:33.724 --> 37:35.757
to act out.

37:35.843 --> 37:38.810
And in her case, it's actually not him.

37:38.929 --> 37:40.145
In her case,

37:40.230 --> 37:45.834
it was a little girl, who
I met outside initially.

37:46.522 --> 37:48.639
What was the reaction
to the little girl?

37:48.724 --> 37:49.974
When she was younger,

37:50.076 --> 37:53.327
she would say that there was
a little girl in a red dress...

37:53.446 --> 37:55.529
- Mm-hmm.
- ...that played with her toys.

37:55.648 --> 37:58.182
Wow.

37:58.267 --> 38:02.244
This living little girl was
feeling a loss of control.

38:02.329 --> 38:04.913
She was very frightened.

38:04.999 --> 38:06.648
She's been ripped out of that bed.

38:06.734 --> 38:09.351
I mean, she's okay,
tucked in, sleeping good.

38:09.437 --> 38:11.770
By the time I hit our bedroom door,

38:11.856 --> 38:13.572
you hear thump.

38:13.691 --> 38:15.524
Started screaming.

38:15.659 --> 38:17.826
Something has ripped her
out of the bed, on the floor,

38:17.912 --> 38:20.145
and it has happened more than once.

38:20.264 --> 38:21.597
Oh, my gosh.

38:21.732 --> 38:23.632
Okay.

38:26.520 --> 38:30.706
My belief is that there
is some kind of devil here.

38:33.427 --> 38:37.146
And it's been here for a very long time.

38:37.248 --> 38:41.050
And it influenced the creepy guy,

38:41.152 --> 38:43.407
more than likely when
he was still alive.

38:43.507 --> 38:49.462
And it's feeding off
of him in his death.

38:49.562 --> 38:52.096
Same with the little
girl, unfortunately.

38:52.231 --> 38:54.699
And he's utilizing her soul

38:54.784 --> 38:58.235
and taking on her appearance
and things of that nature.

38:58.338 --> 39:01.973
Like, this is the frickin' devil.

39:02.058 --> 39:08.946
I had a feeling that there was
a demonic or dark spirit here.

39:09.082 --> 39:12.166
I felt it. I'll go down fighting.

39:13.619 --> 39:16.420
You know, I will go to the
end of the world for my kids.

39:18.291 --> 39:19.640
I will do whatever it takes.

39:35.798 --> 39:38.017
Now, I been doing this
a long time with Amy,

39:38.117 --> 39:40.518
and when you guys were
telling me about the activity,

39:40.653 --> 39:42.736
I had a funny feeling this
wasn't gonna be a good night.

39:42.855 --> 39:45.523
But I never imagined this.

39:46.749 --> 39:48.582
Now we know what you're up against.

39:48.684 --> 39:50.684
Big question is, how do you fight it?

39:50.786 --> 39:52.599
For that answer, I'm
gonna turn it over to Amy.

39:56.321 --> 40:01.057
Many, many people believe
that there are certain areas

40:01.143 --> 40:08.098
across the world that have
these gateways to Hell.

40:08.183 --> 40:15.605
Unfortunately, I think that
this is one of those places.

40:15.691 --> 40:20.360
I think, unfortunately,

40:20.445 --> 40:25.782
the best thing to do is to
get out and get out fast.

40:30.589 --> 40:34.924
And it doesn't end there because
this thing has attached to you.

40:35.010 --> 40:39.696
You guys need someone to
come and do an exorcism

40:39.781 --> 40:42.098
on each one of you.

40:42.200 --> 40:47.220
My worst nightmare just... came true.

40:47.339 --> 40:48.621
Need to leave quickly.

40:48.707 --> 40:51.558
And then, you cannot come back.

40:54.579 --> 40:56.463
Don't even come back
to the frickin' area.

40:58.200 --> 41:00.133
You need to save their souls.

41:02.854 --> 41:05.655
That's the
worst-case scenario, period.

41:05.741 --> 41:07.040
Amy's telling you you
got to get the frig out.

41:07.125 --> 41:08.508
What're you gonna do?

41:08.627 --> 41:10.760
Are you guys gonna take Amy's advice?

41:10.846 --> 41:13.963
- We're gone.
- Yeah, gone, like, tomorrow.

41:15.634 --> 41:17.301
What about the exorcist part?

41:17.436 --> 41:19.470
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, that's happening.

41:19.555 --> 41:25.142
I'm sorry that it turned
out to be like this.

41:25.277 --> 41:26.694
I honestly knew.

41:26.812 --> 41:29.380
I'll do what I have to do...

41:30.750 --> 41:31.932
For my kids.

41:33.002 --> 41:35.953
The only way Lisa and
Jennifer can save their family

41:36.021 --> 41:39.523
from this demon is to move
as far away as possible.

41:39.625 --> 41:42.025
If they do that and get an exorcism

41:42.128 --> 41:44.661
for every member of their family,

41:44.764 --> 41:46.397
they should be able to
lead a peaceful life.
