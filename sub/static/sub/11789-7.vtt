WEBVTT

00:02.400 --> 00:03.594
DON'T LIKE ABOUT YOURSELF.

00:03.600 --> 00:07.593
>> UH, I CAN'T LOOK AT MYSELF IN

00:07.600 --> 00:10.831
THE MIRROR. IT'S, UH...IT'S TOO

00:10.840 --> 00:11.704
PAINFUL.

00:11.710 --> 00:13.678
>> MR. WHITE, I'M NOT EXACTLY

00:13.680 --> 00:15.705
SURE WHAT WE CAN DO FOR YOU.

00:15.710 --> 00:17.575
>> I HAVE A CONDITION CALLED

00:17.580 --> 00:19.810
B.I.I.D.--BODY INTEGRITY

00:19.820 --> 00:21.549
IDENTITY DISORDER. NO MATTER HOW

00:21.550 --> 00:22.710
MANY PSYCHIATRISTS I'VE SEEN OR

00:22.720 --> 00:24.585
MEDICATIONS I'VE TAKEN, I CAN'T

00:24.590 --> 00:26.512
STOP OBSESSING ABOUT MY LEG.

00:26.520 --> 00:28.715
>> WELL, YOU'VE, UH...YOU'VE

00:28.720 --> 00:30.585
SUFFERED A BIG LOSS. IT'S VERY

00:30.590 --> 00:31.249
NATU RAL--

00:31.260 --> 00:32.352
>> NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. YOU DON'T

00:32.360 --> 00:34.328
UNDERSTAND. UH...

00:34.330 --> 00:36.469
>> MR. WHITE, PLEASE, KEEP YOUR

00:36.470 --> 00:37.789
PANTS ON. WE DON'T DO

00:37.800 --> 00:38.789
PROSTH ETICS.

00:38.800 --> 00:40.131
>> I DON'T WANT ONE. I JUST WANT

00:40.140 --> 00:41.334
MY BODY TO REFLECT WHO I AM

00:41.340 --> 00:42.136
INSIDE.

00:55.650 --> 00:57.845
I WANT YOU TO REMOVE MY LEG.

00:57.850 --> 00:59.181
[QUENTIN CLEARS THROAT]

01:03.360 --> 01:05.726
EVER SINCE I WAS 5 OR 6, I'VE

01:05.730 --> 01:07.220
FELT I HAD THIS EXTRA

01:07.230 --> 01:08.891
APPENDAGE. I USED TO ASK GOD TO

01:08.900 --> 01:10.561
MAKE THIS AWFUL FEELING GO AWAY.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.765
IT DIDN'T. I TURNED 40 LAST

01:12.770 --> 01:14.761
WEEK, AND NOW I HAVE A DIFFERENT

01:14.770 --> 01:16.658
PRAYER. IF THERE IS A GOD, I

01:16.670 --> 01:18.206
JUST WANT HIM TO LEAD ME TO A

01:18.210 --> 01:20.770
DOCTOR WHO WILL HELP ME END THIS

01:20.780 --> 01:24.272
AGONY.

01:24.280 --> 01:25.372
>> YOU HAVE BUILT YOUR PRACTICE

01:25.380 --> 01:26.847
ON BODY MODIFICATION, AND I AM

01:26.850 --> 01:28.147
NO DIFFERENT THAN SOMEBODY WHO'D

01:28.150 --> 01:29.185
COME TO YOU FOR A SEX CHANGE.

01:29.190 --> 01:30.441
WOULD YOU TURN HIM AWAY?

01:30.450 --> 01:31.382
>> NO, BUT WE WOULD BE HELPING

01:31.390 --> 01:34.484
HIM, NOT MAIMING HIM.

01:34.490 --> 01:38.586
>> MY FRIEND ERIC...I MET HIM IN

01:38.590 --> 01:41.354
A SUPPORT GROUP. HE'D FINALLY

01:41.360 --> 01:42.327
FOUND A DOCTOR WILLING TO

01:42.330 --> 01:44.594
PERFORM THE SURGERY IN MEXICO--A

01:44.600 --> 01:47.694
DR. CARRION. SO I LOANED HIM THE

01:47.700 --> 01:48.894
$10,000, I DROVE HIM TO THE

01:48.900 --> 01:52.336
AIRPORT. HE WAS SO HAPPY. HE'D

01:52.340 --> 01:55.878
FINALLY BE FREE.

01:55.880 --> 01:57.643
THEY FOUND HIM IN A GARAGE WITH

01:57.650 --> 01:59.208
BOTH OF HIS LEGS CUT OFF. HE

01:59.220 --> 02:01.279
DIED OF GANGRENE AND INFECTION.

02:01.280 --> 02:02.486
IT TURNS OUT DR. CARRION NEVER

02:02.490 --> 02:03.889
HAD A LICENSE.

02:03.890 --> 02:06.882
>> MR. WHITE, NO LICENSED

02:06.890 --> 02:08.357
PHYSICIAN WILL TAKE OFF A

02:08.360 --> 02:09.759
HEALTHY LIMB JUST BECAUSE "IT

02:09.760 --> 02:10.886
ISN'T YOU."

02:10.890 --> 02:11.925
>> DON'T TALK TO ME LIKE I'M

02:11.930 --> 02:14.319
INSANE, DR. TROY. I AM A

02:14.330 --> 02:16.867
SUCCESSFUL ARCHITECT. I DIDN'T

02:16.870 --> 02:17.859
ASK FOR THIS CONDITION. I WAS

02:17.870 --> 02:19.292
BORN THIS WAY. I HAD NO CHOICE

02:19.300 --> 02:20.232
IN THE MATTER.

02:20.240 --> 02:21.593
>> WHAT ABOUT YOUR FAMILY? ARE

02:21.600 --> 02:22.931
THEY IN FAVOR OF THIS?

02:22.940 --> 02:25.636
>> MY WIFE, SHE, UH, TOOK MY SON

02:25.640 --> 02:28.507
AND LEFI' ALMOST A YEAR AGO.

02:28.510 --> 02:32.970
>> MR. WHITE, A PROCEDURE LIKE

02:32.980 --> 02:34.914
THIS, IT WOULDN'T EXACTLY BE

02:34.920 --> 02:36.444
COVERED BY YOUR HMO.

02:36.450 --> 02:39.954
>> MONEY IS NOT AN OBJECT.

02:39.960 --> 02:42.520
I'M NOT ASKING FOR FAVORS, JUST

02:42.530 --> 02:46.990
CONTROL OVER MY OWN BODY. THERE

02:47.000 --> 02:47.955
ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LIKE US

02:47.960 --> 02:49.928
ALL OVER THE WORLD WHO ARE

02:49.930 --> 02:52.467
WILLING TO LOSE EVERYTHING, OUR

02:52.470 --> 02:53.494
FAMILIES, OUR FRIENDS, OUR

02:53.500 --> 02:56.731
LIVES, TO BE AT PEACE AND TO

02:56.740 --> 02:59.732
FINALLY FEEL WHOLE.

03:52.700 --> 03:53.689
Quentin: SO I GUESS YOU'RE JUST

03:53.700 --> 03:55.725
GOING TO DISMISS THIS CASE.

03:55.730 --> 03:59.063
>> WATCH ME. CASE DISMISSED.

03:59.070 --> 04:00.332
>> IT IS A LITTLE INCONSISTENT,

04:00.340 --> 04:01.932
THOUGH, ISN'T IT? I MEAN, WE

04:01.940 --> 04:03.407
CORRECT A LOT OF IMAGINED FLAWS

04:03.410 --> 04:05.059
TO ALLEVIATE PSYCHOLOGICAL PAIN.

04:05.070 --> 04:06.674
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT MR. WHITE'S

04:06.680 --> 04:07.931
ASKING US TO DO.

04:07.940 --> 04:09.373
>> AND ONCE HE'S LOST HIS LEG

04:09.380 --> 04:10.608
AND HE GOES HOPPING DOWN THE

04:10.610 --> 04:12.009
LOONY TRAIL, HE'LL REALIZE THAT

04:12.010 --> 04:15.548
HIS AMPUTATION SOLVED NOTHING.

04:15.550 --> 04:18.041
>> WELL, I'M NOT SAYING WE

04:18.050 --> 04:19.381
SHOULD DO IT. I'M JUST SAYING

04:19.390 --> 04:20.049
THAT MAYBE YOU SHOULD DO A

04:20.060 --> 04:22.051
LITTLE RESEARCH BEFORE YOU TURN

04:22.060 --> 04:25.382
INTO SEAN.

04:25.390 --> 04:26.948
>> AND WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO

04:26.960 --> 04:27.949
MEAN?

04:27.960 --> 04:29.325
>> YOU ALWAYS TALK ABOUT SEAN'S

04:29.330 --> 04:31.423
MORAL POSTURING. WELL, HE'S GONE

04:31.430 --> 04:33.034
NOW, AND YOU NEED TO START

04:33.040 --> 04:35.065
THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX. YOU

04:35.070 --> 04:37.004
WANT TO BE CUTTING-EDGE, RIGHT?

04:37.010 --> 04:39.706
WHO'S STOPPING YOU?

04:47.720 --> 04:48.778
>> YOU'RE CERTAINLY HIGHLY

04:48.780 --> 04:52.580
QUALIFIED. DAMN. THE MONEY I

04:52.590 --> 04:54.012
COULD MAKE AS A CIVILIAN SURGEON

04:54.020 --> 04:57.854
LIFI'ING SAGGY TITS AND ASSES.

04:57.860 --> 04:59.418
TELL ME, DR. MCNAMARA, WHY WOULD

04:59.430 --> 05:00.897
A RICH, LIBERAL PLASTIC SURGEON

05:00.900 --> 05:02.868
WANT TO ASSIST THE FBI?

05:02.870 --> 05:04.121
>> IT'S JUST MY WORK STARTED TO

05:04.130 --> 05:06.598
LOSE ITS MEANING. I SPOKE TO

05:06.600 --> 05:08.033
DR. GROTI'EN AT THE AMERICAN

05:08.040 --> 05:09.701
BOARD OF PLASTIC SURGERY. WE

05:09.710 --> 05:11.007
WERE FRIENDS IN MEDICAL SCHOOL,

05:11.010 --> 05:11.999
AND I TOLD HIM I WAS LOOKING FOR

05:12.010 --> 05:13.739
SOMETHING WITH MORE PURPOSE.

05:13.740 --> 05:14.832
WANT TO GET BACK IN TOUCH WITH

05:14.840 --> 05:16.068
THE REASON I BECAME A PHYSICIAN

05:16.080 --> 05:17.809
IN THE FIRST PLACE. HE TOLD ME

05:17.810 --> 05:18.777
ABOUT YOUR PROGRAM.

05:18.780 --> 05:19.917
>> 6 FIGURES ISN'T DOING IT FOR

05:19.920 --> 05:20.909
YOU ANYMORE?

05:20.920 --> 05:24.879
>> I WANT TO BE OF SERVICE.

05:24.890 --> 05:27.711
I LEFI' MY PRACTICE, MY WIFE, MY

05:27.720 --> 05:29.824
SON AND DAUGHTER. I ALWAYS

05:29.830 --> 05:31.127
THOUGHT I'D DIE WITHOUT THEM,

05:31.130 --> 05:34.759
BUT I DIDN'T. I'M ALIVE. ALIVE

05:34.760 --> 05:36.489
WITH NOTHING TO LIVE FOR.

05:36.500 --> 05:37.797
>> COULD YOU SPEAK UP? IT'S HARD

05:37.800 --> 05:38.698
TO HEAR THROUGH ALL THOSE

05:38.700 --> 05:39.496
VIOLINS.

05:39.500 --> 05:40.637
>> LISTEN, IF YOU DON'T WANT MY

05:40.640 --> 05:41.538
SERVICES--

05:41.540 --> 05:42.768
>> I DIDN'T SAY THAT, BUT I DO

05:42.770 --> 05:43.839
WANT YOU TO KNOW WHAT YOU'D BE

05:43.840 --> 05:45.637
GETTING YOURSELF INTO WERE I TO

05:45.640 --> 05:48.768
ACCEPT YOUR SERVICES. WORKING AS

05:48.780 --> 05:49.769
A SURGEON IN THE WITNESS

05:49.780 --> 05:51.077
PROTECTION PROGRAM REQUIRES

05:51.080 --> 05:52.047
TOTAL SECRECY.

05:52.050 --> 05:53.176
>> THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

05:53.180 --> 05:54.670
>> AND THERE'S NOT A LOT OF WARM

05:54.680 --> 05:55.772
AND FUZZIES, IF THAT'S WHAT

05:55.780 --> 05:57.179
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. THERE IS NO

05:57.190 --> 05:59.112
DOCTOR-PATIENT RELATIONSHIP.

05:59.120 --> 06:00.678
ONCE YOU'VE ALTERED THEIR

06:00.690 --> 06:04.080
APPEARANCE, ALL CONTACT ENDS.

06:04.090 --> 06:05.182
YOU WILL NOT BE TOLD THEIR NEW

06:05.190 --> 06:06.726
NAMES OR THEIR WHEREABOUTS.

06:06.730 --> 06:07.799
>> IT'S THE WORK I'M--

06:07.800 --> 06:10.792
>> LET ME FINISH. LIVES ARE AT

06:10.800 --> 06:12.791
STAKE. IT'S NOT ABOUT YOUR

06:12.800 --> 06:14.995
MID-LIFE CRISIS. THERE'S NO ROOM

06:15.000 --> 06:17.139
FOR EMOTION OR DEBATE. AND IT'S

06:17.140 --> 06:18.209
MY CALL AS TO WHETHER YOUR

06:18.210 --> 06:19.632
SHIT'S TOGETHER ENOUGH TO ACCEPT

06:19.640 --> 06:22.677
THAT. SO...IS YOUR SHIT

06:22.680 --> 06:26.446
TOGETHER, DR. MCNAMARA?

06:26.450 --> 06:29.442
>> NO, IT'S NOT. MY SHIT IS

06:29.450 --> 06:31.213
DEFINITELY NOT TOGETHER.

06:31.220 --> 06:33.814
>> GOOD. THEN YOU WON'T HAVE ANY

06:33.820 --> 06:36.584
TROUBLE TAKING ORDERS FROM ME.

06:36.590 --> 06:38.558
YOUR FIRST CONSULT'S WAITING IN

06:38.560 --> 06:41.120
THE GARDEN--NICOLE MORRETI'I.

06:44.670 --> 06:46.069
>> SHE'S VERY PRETI'Y.

06:46.070 --> 06:48.459
>> IT'S NOT ABOUT CHANGING

06:48.470 --> 06:51.064
LOOKS. IT'S ABOUT SAVING A LIFE.

06:51.070 --> 06:52.469
I'LL BE WORKING ALONGSIDE YOU TO

06:52.480 --> 06:53.708
PRESERVE THE RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN

06:53.710 --> 06:55.701
THE MOTHER AND SON.

06:55.710 --> 06:56.802
>> SON?

07:11.690 --> 07:12.952
NICOLE MORRE'I'I'I?

07:12.960 --> 07:14.928
>> OH...

07:14.930 --> 07:16.659
>> I'M DR. MCNAMARA. I'LL BE

07:16.670 --> 07:18.865
DOING YOUR SURGERY. I'M SORRY,

07:18.870 --> 07:21.191
MS. MORRE'I'I'I. I GUESS SNEAKING

07:21.200 --> 07:22.633
UP ON SOMEONE ABOUT TO ENTER THE

07:22.640 --> 07:24.005
WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAM--

07:24.010 --> 07:25.739
>> IT'S OK. YOU'RE A DOCTOR. AT

07:25.740 --> 07:26.729
LEAST YOU KNOW HOW TO RESTART A

07:26.740 --> 07:29.846
HEART. PLEASE CALL ME NIKKI.

07:35.880 --> 07:38.110
MY HUSBAND VIC WAS A MEMBER OF

07:38.120 --> 07:40.657
THE CARDONI FAMILY. IN THE

07:40.660 --> 07:41.581
BEGINNING, I PRETENDED NOT TO

07:41.590 --> 07:43.888
KNOW. ALL I KNEW WAS THAT WE

07:43.890 --> 07:46.791
BELONGED TOGETHER. DON'T GET TO

07:46.800 --> 07:47.892
PICK WHOM YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH,

07:47.900 --> 07:48.753
DO YOU?

07:48.760 --> 07:52.196
>> NO, YOU DON'T.

07:52.200 --> 07:54.634
>> THE FBI SAW ME AS A MARK.

07:54.640 --> 07:55.891
THEY SAID IF I GAVE THEM

07:55.900 --> 07:57.265
INFORMATION, WE WOULD ALL HAVE

07:57.270 --> 07:59.534
IMMUNITY. THEY WOULD HELP US

07:59.540 --> 08:02.748
MOVE, START OVER. BUT CARDONI

08:02.750 --> 08:04.775
DIDN'T GIVE IMMUNITY. ON THE

08:04.780 --> 08:05.974
AFTERNOON OF OUR SON'S

08:05.980 --> 08:08.642
BIRTHDAY--HE HAD JUST TURNED

08:08.650 --> 08:14.316
12--VIC WAS COMING HOME EARLY.

08:14.320 --> 08:16.788
THEY SHOT HIM, COMING OUT OF A

08:16.790 --> 08:19.327
SPORTING GOODS STORE. HE WOULD

08:19.330 --> 08:20.558
STILL BE ALIVE TODAY IF IT

08:20.560 --> 08:23.324
WEREN'T FOR ME. AND NOW LOOK AT

08:23.330 --> 08:26.595
ALL THIS WE GO'I'I'A GO THROUGH.

08:26.600 --> 08:29.330
>> YOU'LL BE FINE, I PROMISE.

08:29.340 --> 08:30.705
THE PROCEDURE WILL BE MINIMAL,

08:30.710 --> 08:32.769
ENOUGH TO BE EFFECTIVE WITHOUT

08:32.780 --> 08:38.207
BEING TOO RADICAL.

08:38.210 --> 08:40.610
A NARROWING OF YOUR NOSE, CHEEK

08:40.620 --> 08:42.349
IMPLANTS, POSSIBLY MINOR

08:42.350 --> 08:44.147
LIPOSUCT ION IN THE LOWER JAW

08:44.150 --> 08:46.857
REGION. A CHANGE IN HAIR COLOR,

08:46.860 --> 08:48.919
TINTED CONTACT LENSES...

08:48.920 --> 08:49.955
SOMETIMES MINOR ADJUSTMENTS ARE

08:49.960 --> 08:51.052
ALL THAT'S NEEDED TO CHANGE YOUR

08:51.060 --> 08:52.220
APPEARANCE.

08:52.230 --> 08:55.893
>> WHAT ABOUT AUSTIN? HAVE YOU

08:55.900 --> 08:57.026
EVER DONE SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO

08:57.030 --> 08:58.361
A BOY HIS AGE?

08:58.370 --> 08:59.962
>> A GOOD SURGEON ALWAYS TAKES

08:59.970 --> 09:01.892
INTO ACCOUNT HOW THE YOUNG

09:01.900 --> 09:03.231
PERSON'S BONE STRUCTURE WILL

09:03.240 --> 09:06.129
DEVELOP AND CHANGE. AND I'M A

09:06.140 --> 09:09.075
GOOD SURGEON, MS. MORRETI'I.

09:13.080 --> 09:14.149
Julia: WELL, PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE

09:14.150 --> 09:15.617
TO RESERVE A SPACE AT ANOTHER

09:15.620 --> 09:19.078
TIME?

09:19.090 --> 09:21.786
NO, I UNDERSTAND, ALTHOUGH BEING

09:21.790 --> 09:25.089
NEW DOES HAVE ITS ADVANTAGES.

09:25.090 --> 09:26.125
NO, WE'RE NOT LISTED IN THAT

09:26.130 --> 09:27.688
PUBLICATION YET, BUT ONCE WE'RE

09:27.700 --> 09:30.396
REVIEWED, I'M SURE IT'LL BE--

09:30.400 --> 09:34.291
ABSOLUTELY. WE'LL STILL BE HERE.

09:34.300 --> 09:38.009
[SIGH] IT'S A VICIOUS CIRCLE.

09:38.010 --> 09:39.261
PEOPLE WON'T COME BECAUSE NO ONE

09:39.270 --> 09:40.806
KNOWS ABOUT US, AND NO ONE KNOWS

09:40.810 --> 09:42.744
ABOUT US BECAUSE NO ONE COMES.

09:42.750 --> 09:45.378
>> WELL, MS. CARR SEEMS VERY

09:45.380 --> 09:49.077
HAPPY AND VERY WELL-CONNECT ED.

09:49.080 --> 09:51.082
>> I'LL BRING HER SOME FLOWERS.

09:51.090 --> 09:52.910
I DON'T WANT OUR ONLY CLIENT

09:52.920 --> 09:54.979
HAPPY. I WANT HER ECSTATIC.

10:00.160 --> 10:01.798
GOOD MORNING. I BROUGHT YOU SOME

10:01.800 --> 10:03.165
FRESH FLOWERS. A LITTLE

10:03.170 --> 10:04.797
PAMPERING SPEEDS UP THE RECOVERY

10:04.800 --> 10:07.439
PROCESS. IF THERE'S ANYTHING

10:07.440 --> 10:09.089
ELSE I CAN GET YOU--SOME FRESH

10:09.100 --> 10:10.408
CUCUMBER WATER OR...

10:10.410 --> 10:12.298
>> HONEY, PLEASE. IT'S GONNA BE

10:12.310 --> 10:13.732
HARD ENOUGH ADJUSTIN' TO REALITY

10:13.740 --> 10:16.948
AFTER A WEEK IN THIS PARADISE.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.906
>> WELL, WE'RE STILL NEW, SO IF

10:18.910 --> 10:20.446
YOU CAN HELP SPREAD THE WORD.

10:20.450 --> 10:21.940
Gretchen Carr: OH, LIKE

10:21.950 --> 10:24.282
WILDFIRE, DARLIN'. A LOT OF US

10:24.290 --> 10:25.780
OUT-OF-STATE GIRLS COME TO

10:25.790 --> 10:27.212
FLORIDA FOR A QUICKIE AND HAVE

10:27.220 --> 10:28.915
NO IDEA WHERE TO GO AFI'ERWARDS.

10:28.920 --> 10:30.387
I JUST THANK THE LORD HE SENT ME

10:30.390 --> 10:31.789
TO THE GYM THAT MORNIN' AND THEN

10:31.790 --> 10:33.189
GUIDED ME TO THE ELLIPTICAL

10:33.200 --> 10:34.929
MACHINE NEXT TO LIZ.

10:34.930 --> 10:35.919
>> WITHIN 5 MINUTES, SHE KNEW I

10:35.930 --> 10:37.022
WAS GAY, AND I KNEW SHE WAS

10:37.030 --> 10:38.429
HAVING LIPO. THERE ARE NO

10:38.430 --> 10:39.863
SECRETS WHEN YOU'RE JIGGLING UP

10:39.870 --> 10:41.064
AN ELECTRONIC MOUNTAIN.

10:41.070 --> 10:42.196
[LAUGHING]

10:42.200 --> 10:43.337
>> THE OFFICE TOILET IS

10:45.110 --> 10:46.304
TOOK A BIG DUMP OR SOME HOMELESS

10:46.310 --> 10:47.277
BEACH...

10:50.050 --> 10:53.941
OH. I'M SORRY. ITHOUGHT YOU

10:53.950 --> 10:55.178
WERE DISCHARGED.

10:55.180 --> 10:56.989
Gretchen: DON'T WORRY. I HAVE

10:56.990 --> 10:58.116
TWO BOYS. I'VE BEEN UNCLOGGIN'

10:58.120 --> 11:00.213
TOILETS FOR 17 YEARS.

11:00.220 --> 11:01.357
>> YOU DON'T HAVE KIDS THAT OLD.

11:01.360 --> 11:04.079
SO, WHAT? DID YOU GIVE BIRTH AT

11:04.090 --> 11:05.227
13?

11:05.230 --> 11:06.925
>> 23.

11:06.930 --> 11:08.750
>> I WANT THE NUMBER OF YOUR

11:08.760 --> 11:09.761
SURGEON.

11:09.770 --> 11:10.725
>> OH, HE HASN'T TOUCHED MY

11:10.730 --> 11:12.834
FACE...YET. I JUST HAD A LITTLE

11:12.840 --> 11:13.499
LIPO.

11:13.500 --> 11:14.762
Liz: SEE? IT'S ALL A MATTER OF

11:14.770 --> 11:16.192
DIET--VEGETABLES, 8 GLASSES OF

11:16.200 --> 11:17.235
WATER A DAY.

11:17.240 --> 11:18.434
>> I PUT SEMEN ON MY FACE EVERY

11:18.440 --> 11:21.876
NIGHT BEFORE I GO TO BED.

11:21.880 --> 11:23.142
>> AND I WAS WORRIED ABOUT

11:23.150 --> 11:25.300
SAYING "SHIT."

11:25.310 --> 11:27.016
>> BEFORE THE DIVORCE, MY

11:27.020 --> 11:29.909
HUSBAND USED TO LIKE TO...

11:29.920 --> 11:33.083
SPRAY HIS SEED ALL OVER MY FACE.

11:33.090 --> 11:33.988
DIDN'T DO A THING FOR ME

11:33.990 --> 11:36.515
SEXUALLY, BUT I DID NOTICE HOW

11:36.520 --> 11:38.226
MUCH BETTER MY SKIN LOOKED

11:38.230 --> 11:40.118
AFTERWARDS. WELL, I CHECKED, AND

11:40.130 --> 11:41.825
IT TURNS OUT THAT SPERM IS CHOCK

11:41.830 --> 11:43.388
FULL OF ALL THESE WONDERFUL

11:43.400 --> 11:46.494
THINGS--AMINO ACIDS, PROTEINS,

11:46.500 --> 11:48.058
VITAMIN C.

11:48.070 --> 11:48.968
>> WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT SUPPLY

11:48.970 --> 11:49.902
NOW THAT YOUR HUSBAND'S NOT

11:49.910 --> 11:50.467
AROUND?

11:50.470 --> 11:51.539
>> OH, THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM. I

11:51.540 --> 11:53.474
GET ALL I NEED FROM MY SONS.

11:53.480 --> 11:56.040
Julia: YOUR SONS? YOU PUT YOUR

11:56.040 --> 11:57.974
SONS' SEMEN ON YOUR FACE?

11:57.980 --> 12:00.312
>> WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE I STAND

12:00.320 --> 12:03.289
OVER THEM AND WATCH. I GIVE THEM

12:03.290 --> 12:05.349
THESE LITTLE AMBER BOTTLES, THEY

12:05.350 --> 12:06.442
FILL THEM UP, AND PUT THEM ON MY

12:06.450 --> 12:08.554
NIGHT TABLE.

12:08.560 --> 12:09.879
WELL, IT'S THE LEAST THEY CAN

12:09.890 --> 12:11.118
DO. IT'S NOT LIKE I'M ASKING

12:11.130 --> 12:13.428
THEM TO UNLOAD THE DISHWASHER.

12:13.430 --> 12:15.295
Gina: NO ONE HERE COULD ACCUSE

12:15.300 --> 12:16.551
ME OF BEING A PRUDE, RIGHT?

12:16.560 --> 12:17.891
>> NO ONE ANYWHERE.

12:17.900 --> 12:19.458
>> BUT TAKING YOUR SONS' SPOOGE

12:19.470 --> 12:21.438
AND PUTTING IT ON YOUR FACE?

12:21.440 --> 12:23.499
>> WELL, SCIENTIFICALLY

12:23.510 --> 12:25.262
SPEAKING, MRS. CARR IS SIMPLY

12:25.270 --> 12:26.931
USING AN ALL-NATURAL,

12:26.940 --> 12:28.805
FRESH-CELL, HORMONE-RICH

12:28.810 --> 12:30.539
SUBSTANCE UNCONTAMINATED BY

12:30.550 --> 12:32.279
CANCER-CAUSING PRESERVATIVES.

12:32.280 --> 12:33.918
>> IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE MAKING

12:33.920 --> 12:34.841
A SALES PITCH.

12:34.850 --> 12:35.919
>> YOU'RE NOT MAKIN' A SALES

12:35.920 --> 12:37.911
PITCH...ARE YOU?

12:37.920 --> 12:40.184
>> NO! NO, OF COURSE NOT. IT'S

12:40.190 --> 12:42.829
TOTALLY DISGUSTING. I'M JUST

12:42.830 --> 12:44.388
SAYING THAT, FROM A BUSINESS

12:44.390 --> 12:46.221
PERSPECTIVE, IT'S EFFECTIVE,

12:46.230 --> 12:47.197
IT'S HEALTHY,

12:47.200 --> 12:48.849
IT'S CHEAP TO PRODUCE.

12:48.860 --> 12:50.464
SPERM BANKS THROW AWAY TONS OF

12:50.470 --> 12:53.462
UNUSED DONATIONS, AND SEMEN'S AN

12:53.470 --> 12:54.869
ANTI-DEPRESSANT. IT HAS

12:54.870 --> 12:57.134
MOOD-ALTERING HORMONES IN IT. I

12:57.140 --> 12:58.061
READ ABOUT IT.

12:58.070 --> 12:59.503
>> DIDN'T DO A THING FOR ME.

12:59.510 --> 13:00.534
Gina: THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

13:00.540 --> 13:01.973
MY ENTIRE LIFE I THOUGHT THERE

13:01.980 --> 13:03.299
WAS A PSYCHOLOGICAL REASON WHY

13:03.310 --> 13:05.005
I'M A SEX ADDICT. TURNS OUT I

13:05.010 --> 13:07.478
WAS JUST JONESING FOR JIZZ. WE

13:07.480 --> 13:08.947
ARE SO SITTING ON A GOLD MINE

13:08.950 --> 13:09.473
HERE.

13:09.480 --> 13:11.516
>> WE ARE NOT GOING TO BOTTLE

13:11.520 --> 13:12.509
SEM EN.

13:12.520 --> 13:14.317
>> LOOK, WE NEED A SIGNATURE

13:14.320 --> 13:16.049
PRODUCT, SOMETHING THAT MAKES US

13:16.060 --> 13:17.482
DISTINCT IVE, GETS PEOPLE TO

13:17.490 --> 13:19.287
NOTICE US. I MEAN, IF WE CAN'T

13:19.290 --> 13:20.325
MAKE A NAME FOR OURSELVES,

13:20.330 --> 13:21.399
THEY'RE GONNA FORECLOSE THIS

13:21.400 --> 13:23.220
PLACE, OK? AND THEN SEAN AND

13:23.230 --> 13:24.458
CHRISTIAN WILL SAY THEY KNEW ALL

13:24.470 --> 13:25.494
ALONG THAT WE'D SCREW IT

13:25.500 --> 13:27.092
UP--THAT I WOULD SCREW IT UP

13:27.100 --> 13:28.237
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE WHAT IT

13:28.240 --> 13:30.128
TAKES TO BE A SUCCESS, AND I

13:30.140 --> 13:31.539
CAN'T LET THEM BE RIGHT ABOUT

13:31.540 --> 13:36.000
THAT. NEITHER CAN YOU.

13:51.230 --> 13:53.357
>> DR. TROY. THANK YOU FOR

13:53.360 --> 13:56.557
COMING. I WAS THRILLED WHEN YOU

13:56.560 --> 13:57.925
CALLED AND AGREED TO SEE ME

13:57.930 --> 14:00.034
AGAIN. I JUST THOUGHT BY COMING

14:00.040 --> 14:01.291
HERE, YOU'D SEE I'M NOT SOME,

14:01.300 --> 14:04.133
UH, CRAZY HOMELESS MAN. I KNOW

14:04.140 --> 14:07.109
IT'S A BIZARRE REQUEST.

14:07.110 --> 14:08.202
>> "THE AMERICAN ARCHITECTURE

14:08.210 --> 14:12.271
AWARD." THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.

14:12.280 --> 14:14.168
>> I GOT IT FOR AN ATRIUM HOUSE

14:14.180 --> 14:18.310
I DESIGNED IN, UH, 2001. I

14:18.320 --> 14:20.379
UTILIZED THE POWER OF NEGATIVE

14:20.390 --> 14:22.153
SPACE, THE BEAUTY OF WHAT'S

14:22.160 --> 14:24.481
MISSING.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.156
THAT WAS THE LAST THING I

14:29.160 --> 14:31.628
DESIGNED.

14:34.300 --> 14:35.494
>> SO...WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO

14:35.500 --> 14:36.637
DO WITH YOUR CUTTING OFF YOUR

14:36.640 --> 14:37.629
LEG?

14:37.640 --> 14:38.629
>> MY OBSESSION HAS GOTTEN SO

14:38.640 --> 14:39.937
BAD LATELY, IT'S ALL I CAN THINK

14:39.940 --> 14:43.239
OF. NOTHING ELSE MATTERS.

14:43.250 --> 14:46.105
DEPRESSION HAS A DULLING EFFECT.

14:46.110 --> 14:47.316
WHEN YOU IMPLIED THAT YOU STILL

14:47.320 --> 14:48.344
MIGHT DO IT--

14:48.350 --> 14:52.047
>> MIGHT.

14:52.050 --> 14:54.416
I TOOK AN OATH AS A PHYSICIAN.

14:54.420 --> 14:57.423
FIRST DO NO HARM.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.990
>> THE "HYPOCRITICAL" OATH.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.422
[CH UCKLES] THE MEDICAL

15:01.430 --> 15:02.590
PROFESSION'S UNWILLINGNESS TO

15:02.600 --> 15:04.192
HELP ME AND OTHERS LIKE ME STOP

15:04.200 --> 15:05.963
THE PAIN IS WHAT'S REALLY

15:05.970 --> 15:08.268
HARMFUL.

15:08.270 --> 15:10.465
THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO SHOW YOU

15:10.470 --> 15:13.337
MY CONTINGENCY PLAN.

15:24.090 --> 15:26.979
AUTO-AMPUTATION, DOCTOR.

15:26.990 --> 15:28.719
MY FIRST ATTEMPT AT FURNITURE

15:30.430 --> 15:33.228
DRY ICE. AT MINUS 78 1/2 DEGREES

15:33.230 --> 15:34.424
CENTIGRADE, IT'S COLD ENOUGH TO

15:34.430 --> 15:36.091
FREEZE ONE'S LEG OFF--QUITE

15:36.100 --> 15:38.227
LITERALLY. IN A FEW HOURS, I'LL

15:38.230 --> 15:40.596
BE NUMB AND MY LEG WILL FEEL

15:40.600 --> 15:42.431
LIKE A BLOCK OF WOOD. A MEMBER

15:42.440 --> 15:44.362
OF MY SUPPORT GROUP, A FORMER

15:44.370 --> 15:47.077
NURSE, HAS AGREED TO ASSIST ME.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.502
AS PLASMA STARTS LEAKING THROUGH

15:48.510 --> 15:50.740
THE CAPILLARY WALLS, THE SKIN

15:50.750 --> 15:53.378
AND TISSUES BEGIN TO FREEZE.

15:53.380 --> 15:56.110
NECROSIS SETS IN AT LAST. ONCE

15:56.120 --> 15:57.382
THE SKIN IS CUT, MY LEG WILL

15:57.390 --> 15:58.789
SEPARATE FROM MY BODY AS EASILY

15:58.790 --> 16:01.179
AS A BOILED CHICKEN LEG.

16:07.530 --> 16:09.521
ONCE IT'S GONE, I'LL FINALLY

16:09.530 --> 16:11.122
FEEL WHOLE.

16:11.130 --> 16:13.439
>> WHAT ABOUT THE RISKS? SEPSIS,

16:13.440 --> 16:16.694
GANGRENE, INFECTION? YOU MIGHT

16:16.700 --> 16:18.429
DIE. IS THAT WHY YOU WANTED ME

16:18.440 --> 16:20.203
HERE?

16:20.210 --> 16:22.428
>> I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW I'M

16:22.440 --> 16:25.170
LOSING MY LEG, DOCTOR...

16:25.180 --> 16:27.614
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

16:35.090 --> 16:36.079
>> SO YOUR MOM TELLS ME YOU'RE

16:36.090 --> 16:37.159
INTO BASEBALL.

16:37.160 --> 16:38.752
>> I WAS. WHO KNOWS IF THEY EVEN

16:38.760 --> 16:40.819
HAVE A TEAM WHERE WE'RE GOING.

16:40.830 --> 16:42.388
>> WELL, THEY PRETTY MUCH PLAY

16:42.400 --> 16:43.424
BASEBALL EVERWVHERE IN THE

16:43.430 --> 16:44.567
COUNTRY. THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT

16:44.570 --> 16:46.561
THE NATIONAL PASTIME. ANY

16:46.570 --> 16:49.232
ALLERGIES, PENICILLIN, OTHER

16:49.240 --> 16:50.434
MEDICATIONS?

16:50.440 --> 16:55.070
>> NO, NOT A THING.

16:55.080 --> 16:56.729
>> IS IT BLOCKED?

16:56.740 --> 16:58.241
>> IS WHAT BLOCKED?

16:58.250 --> 17:00.138
>> MY DEVIATED SEPTUM. DR.

17:00.150 --> 17:02.311
SAGAMORE SAID IT WAS. HE SAID I

17:02.320 --> 17:03.344
WASN'T BREATHING THROUGH MY NOSE

17:03.350 --> 17:04.749
ENOUGH.

17:04.750 --> 17:07.787
>> I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

17:07.790 --> 17:09.781
>> WELL...THAT'S WHY I'M HERE,

17:09.790 --> 17:12.429
RIGHT? I MIGHT HAVE TO WEAR

17:12.430 --> 17:16.457
STRIPS AT NIGHT.

17:16.460 --> 17:19.623
WHAT'S WRONG?

17:21.400 --> 17:25.234
>> AUSTIN...

17:25.240 --> 17:26.764
DO YOU KNOW WHAT A PLASTIC

17:26.770 --> 17:29.273
SURGEON IS?

17:29.280 --> 17:30.304
>> YES. THEY CHANGE HOW PEOPLE

17:30.310 --> 17:31.675
LOOK.

17:31.680 --> 17:33.443
>> THAT'S RIGHT. WELL, DR.

17:33.450 --> 17:35.611
SAGAMORE AND DR. MCNAMARA ARE

17:35.620 --> 17:39.215
BOTH PLASTIC SURGEONS AND--

17:39.220 --> 17:42.587
>> THEY'RE GONNA CHANGE MY FACE?

17:42.590 --> 17:44.228
NO. NO, I DON'T WANT THEM TO DO

17:44.230 --> 17:45.288
ANYTHING TO IT.

17:45.290 --> 17:46.621
>> JUST LITTLE CHANGES SO THAT

17:46.630 --> 17:47.756
WE CAN LOOK DIFFERENT.

17:47.760 --> 17:48.624
>> I DON'T WANT TO LOOK

17:48.630 --> 17:50.666
DIFFERENT! I DON'T WANT YOU TO

17:50.670 --> 17:51.694
LOOK DIFFERENT!

17:51.700 --> 17:52.621
>> I KNOW, SWEETIE, BUT WE HAVE

17:52.630 --> 17:53.631
TO DO IT. THIS IS THE ONLY WAY

17:53.640 --> 17:54.766
WE CAN BE SAFE.

17:54.770 --> 17:55.668
>> YOU'RE A LIAR!

17:55.670 --> 17:57.137
>> AUSTIN. AUSTIN, PLEASE.

17:57.140 --> 18:01.679
>> THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT.

18:01.680 --> 18:03.841
>> OH, DR. SAGAMORE SAID NOT TO

18:03.850 --> 18:05.203
TELL HIM.

18:05.210 --> 18:06.370
>> I WISH SOMEONE HAD TOLD ME.

18:06.380 --> 18:07.347
>> I SHOULD HAVE TOLD HIM, NO

18:07.350 --> 18:08.578
MATTER WHAT DR. SAGAMORE SAID.

18:08.580 --> 18:09.569
I'M HIS MOTHER. NOW THERE'S

18:09.580 --> 18:12.083
NOBODY HE CAN TRUST.

18:23.400 --> 18:24.594
>> FIRST THE FISH, NOW THE

18:24.600 --> 18:26.295
FURNITURE.

18:26.300 --> 18:27.597
>> IT'S COMING ALONG, DON'T YOU

18:27.600 --> 18:29.431
THINK?

18:29.440 --> 18:31.738
>> MM.

18:31.740 --> 18:34.777
I WENT TO SEE MR. WHITE.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.202
>> A HOUSE CALL.

18:36.210 --> 18:39.270
WELL, WHEN I SAID RESEARCH, I

18:39.280 --> 18:41.248
MEANT GO ONLINE.

18:41.250 --> 18:44.413
