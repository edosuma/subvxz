00:05.092 --> 00:06.255
- Raylan.
- Art.

00:08.929 --> 00:10.803
I am truly sorry about your aunt.

00:10.931 --> 00:13.469
Well, well, I appreciate it.

00:14.810 --> 00:17.515
If you don't mind,
I'd like to take another week's leave.

00:18.606 --> 00:20.563
Seems like a good idea.

00:23.194 --> 00:25.020
Something else I can
do for you, Raylan?

00:26.405 --> 00:27.650
Yeah. I'd...

00:29.491 --> 00:30.986
I'd like to go back to Glynco,

00:31.869 --> 00:35.949
get out of the field, try my hand
at firearms instruction again.

00:36.916 --> 00:39.703
So, you want me
to recommend you for a promotion?

00:40.502 --> 00:43.456
Yeah, they're always
looking for guys like me.

00:43.714 --> 00:44.959
You mean guys that have shot people?

00:45.090 --> 00:47.878
- Exactly.
- Yeah, well, you got that covered.

00:49.303 --> 00:50.382
Let me think about it.

00:50.512 --> 00:52.172
You saying it's a bad idea?

00:54.767 --> 00:57.388
No. I'm saying I want to think about it.

01:00.147 --> 01:01.807
Good night, Raylan.

01:02.858 --> 01:04.021
Night, Art.

01:17.289 --> 01:18.783
- Mama inside?
- Yeah.

01:26.298 --> 01:27.709
What's that look on your face?

01:28.092 --> 01:29.550
Boyd Crowder wants to parley.

01:30.636 --> 01:32.047
What? No, no, no.

01:32.346 --> 01:34.422
He started all this,
and now he wants to parley?

01:34.556 --> 01:35.801
Doyle, where are Sarah
Jean and the babies?

01:35.933 --> 01:38.388
I got them nice and safe, Mama,
just like you told me to.

01:38.519 --> 01:41.354
Mama, Mama,
I know I don't need to ask you this,

01:41.480 --> 01:43.354
but we ain't gonna sit down
with Boyd, are we?

01:43.774 --> 01:45.352
- Why not?
- I'll tell you why not,

01:45.484 --> 01:46.563
because we don't need him.

01:46.694 --> 01:49.232
We got more than enough men
to crush him like a bug.

01:49.363 --> 01:51.605
And he knows that, Mama.
He knows that.

01:51.740 --> 01:53.614
Why else would he be asking to parley?

01:53.742 --> 01:54.987
Dickie's right about that much.

01:55.119 --> 01:57.242
I mean, he did sound like a man
who's ready to come to terms.

01:57.371 --> 01:59.410
And the thing about that is,
it's too damn late for that.

01:59.623 --> 02:01.165
I mean, he already made his move.

02:01.500 --> 02:03.623
And you had nothing to do with that,
I suppose.

02:04.128 --> 02:07.710
Mama, I explained that to you.

02:09.216 --> 02:14.127
'Course I'm gonna sit down with him.
Why shouldn't I? Everybody makes mistakes.

02:14.304 --> 02:16.593
His was coming after our pot money.

02:17.099 --> 02:19.886
Yours was telling him
what was in your mind.

02:21.311 --> 02:22.770
And mine,

02:24.481 --> 02:27.482
mine was thinking I had
the measure of him.

02:52.718 --> 02:54.627
Right on time.

02:54.762 --> 02:57.253
I do appreciate punctuality.

03:00.100 --> 03:03.220
Look, Doyle Bennett's
more than just a friend.

03:03.979 --> 03:04.975
He's a mentor.

03:05.689 --> 03:08.524
Well, it's all well and
good as far as it goes.

03:09.068 --> 03:10.099
What's that supposed to mean, Boyd?

03:10.235 --> 03:12.275
Makes me wonder why
you're talking to me.

03:13.697 --> 03:15.524
I got my reasons.

03:15.991 --> 03:19.241
Well, let's hear it, Nicky,
'cause from where I'm sitting,

03:19.369 --> 03:22.039
this looks an awful lot like a setup.

03:23.749 --> 03:26.833
I thought the Bennetts were
gonna keep Black Pike out.

03:27.127 --> 03:30.461
Instead, they used us
to make a better deal for themselves.

03:31.006 --> 03:35.086
The runoff from Black Pike is
gonna drive us off that mountain.

03:36.053 --> 03:37.880
Due respect to Doyle,

03:38.680 --> 03:40.839
the Bennetts have had
their way far too long.

03:47.189 --> 03:48.517
That's it?

03:48.857 --> 03:50.055
You got nothing more to say?

03:54.530 --> 03:55.692
I'm not doing this for the money.

03:55.823 --> 03:57.233
I know.

03:57.616 --> 04:01.945
You're doing it to get Doyle out of the
way so that you can be chief of police.

04:48.542 --> 04:50.369
I don't understand
why Loretta doesn't have to go,

04:50.502 --> 04:51.831
but we all still got to.

04:51.962 --> 04:54.667
And I told you, you don't need
to concern yourself about Loretta.

04:54.798 --> 04:56.506
She's got a head cold.
Now get in and zip it.

04:56.633 --> 04:58.009
All right.

04:58.719 --> 05:02.551
Hey. We'll all go to Sunday school
together this week, all right?

05:02.681 --> 05:03.760
Soon as I'm up to it.

05:03.974 --> 05:06.726
God can tell when you're lying, Loretta.
He sees all things.

05:06.894 --> 05:08.637
You don't have that seat belt on
in the next three seconds,

05:08.770 --> 05:10.644
he's gonna see me lay
a hand across your backside.

05:11.315 --> 05:13.556
Any problems, you call us, all right?

05:13.692 --> 05:15.103
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

05:15.235 --> 05:17.691
Feel better. We'll see you in a bit.

05:37.591 --> 05:38.587
Hi.

05:39.092 --> 05:40.088
Hi.

05:42.554 --> 05:44.879
So, is Art gonna make that phone call?

05:47.768 --> 05:51.682
Well, I got the impression it's gonna be
a little harder than I thought.

05:51.813 --> 05:53.272
You don't want to go, do you?

05:53.398 --> 05:54.430
What are you talking about?

05:54.566 --> 05:57.353
- Well, if you wanted to go, we'd be gone.
- It was my idea.

05:57.486 --> 06:00.440
And I'm pregnant, so if you don't want
to go, you need to let me know right now

06:00.572 --> 06:02.066
- so we can deal with it and move on.
- What was that?

06:02.366 --> 06:03.694
If you don't want to go,

06:03.825 --> 06:08.072
- let me know and we can deal with it.
- No, no, not that part, the other part.

06:08.497 --> 06:09.825
You're pregnant?

06:15.921 --> 06:16.917
You're sure?

06:17.130 --> 06:20.713
I didn't know until the day before yesterday,
but I didn't want to tell you at the funeral.

06:20.842 --> 06:23.796
- Why not?
- I just thought you'd be mad.

06:23.929 --> 06:25.008
Mad?

06:26.640 --> 06:30.887
It's like the best news
I've heard in, like...

06:33.021 --> 06:35.144
- Ever?
- That's the word I was looking for.

06:43.949 --> 06:47.484
And we are going to Glynco,
by the way.

06:47.911 --> 06:50.367
I don't know if it'll be six weeks
or six months, but we'll go.

06:50.497 --> 06:51.908
And if we can't go, I'll quit.

06:52.874 --> 06:54.997
You know? Do something else.

06:57.004 --> 06:59.162
I don't have any skills,
so I don't know what that'll be,

06:59.298 --> 07:01.456
but I'll think of something.

07:02.676 --> 07:04.834
Maybe I'll sell ice cream.
I like ice cream.

07:07.389 --> 07:08.552
I'm scared, Raylan.

07:34.416 --> 07:35.791
Well, the Bennetts are in the house.

07:37.169 --> 07:40.004
- Morning, Mags. Doyle.
- Pastor.

07:40.130 --> 07:41.410
Now, at this time, I'm
gonna have to ask you

07:41.548 --> 07:44.751
to surrender any and all weapons
or firearms in your possession.

07:45.844 --> 07:47.172
Thank you.

07:49.848 --> 07:50.844
That's everything.

07:53.435 --> 07:55.178
- Mama, you packing?
- No.

07:56.313 --> 07:59.267
I'll step outside now,
let y'all talk business.

07:59.858 --> 08:02.479
Door's locked till the parley's over.

08:14.956 --> 08:18.076
Well, I want to thank you both
for agreeing to this sit-down.

08:18.251 --> 08:21.371
This is a very sensitive time
for all parties concerned.

08:22.255 --> 08:26.798
But surely, it's better that we talk
things out now than shoot them out later.

08:26.927 --> 08:29.596
Case you didn't notice,
the shooting's already started.

08:29.721 --> 08:33.589
As I was saying, emotions are
running awful high right now.

08:34.768 --> 08:36.725
But nobody wants a full-scale war.

08:36.937 --> 08:38.727
Yeah, nobody without
enough guns, anyway.

08:38.855 --> 08:40.847
I came here to listen
to Boyd Crowder, not you.

08:40.982 --> 08:44.897
Your point is taken, Doyle.
You Bennetts are many. We are few.

08:46.071 --> 08:50.567
But I think we both can agree
that bloodletting is bad for business.

08:51.410 --> 08:52.868
You want to talk about business, huh?

08:52.994 --> 08:54.572
Yeah, Mags, I do.

08:54.705 --> 08:56.115
All right, then.

08:57.999 --> 09:03.705
Aside from money, what is business
but contracts and agreements?

09:05.173 --> 09:07.629
Now, you and me,
we had an agreement.

09:08.385 --> 09:10.674
I gave up my family's
claim on this county,

09:10.804 --> 09:13.342
but for one thing, the pot business.

09:13.473 --> 09:15.181
That is true, Mags, but then
your son Dickie approached me.

09:15.308 --> 09:17.515
You didn't shake hands with Dickie.
You shook hands with me.

09:18.061 --> 09:20.635
We had a deal, and you broke it.

09:23.191 --> 09:25.231
Rest is just chin music.

09:30.073 --> 09:32.481
You're right, Mags. I'm sorry.

09:34.494 --> 09:39.287
Question is, what do you
aim to do about it?

09:45.964 --> 09:46.960
What is this?

09:47.090 --> 09:50.791
The money we took from Dickie,
every single dollar.

09:56.475 --> 10:00.935
Well, now, I'd say that's a step
in the right direction.

10:08.028 --> 10:11.444
- What the hell you doing?
- I'm not staying in that cellar.

10:11.573 --> 10:13.115
Smells like mouldy death down there.

10:13.241 --> 10:15.779
- Yeah, well, Boyd said you got to...
- I know what he said.

10:15.911 --> 10:16.942
You're watching the front.

10:17.078 --> 10:20.447
I'm gonna keep an eye out back,
make some coffee while I'm at it.

10:21.374 --> 10:22.917
Fresh black coffee?

10:24.127 --> 10:25.705
You hear from Johnny?

10:26.421 --> 10:28.497
Yeah. He's at his house.

10:46.775 --> 10:50.226
Strikes me that this little deal of ours
may not be enough for you.

10:51.905 --> 10:56.946
It's enough for now, when it's just you,
Arlo, the cripple, and the other feller.

10:58.787 --> 11:00.826
But one of these days,
you're gonna want more.

11:03.542 --> 11:07.160
And we both know, when that
day comes, you will take more.

11:24.604 --> 11:26.513
Devil, you want sugar?

11:45.041 --> 11:46.619
Johnny Crowder?

12:14.404 --> 12:15.684
Devil!

12:18.950 --> 12:20.361
You stay the hell down!

12:41.181 --> 12:42.177
Hello, Ava.

13:03.495 --> 13:04.490
Dickie!

13:22.180 --> 13:23.674
Hey, Ava! You all right?

13:34.234 --> 13:35.645
It's Dickie.

13:36.695 --> 13:37.690
Answer it.

13:39.739 --> 13:40.735
Yeah?

13:44.202 --> 13:45.317
What?

13:46.538 --> 13:47.948
Are you sure?

13:58.174 --> 13:59.799
Well, I take it that's not good news.

14:01.469 --> 14:05.549
I didn't want to make the mistake
of underestimating you, Mags,

14:05.682 --> 14:07.840
but now I think we
understand each other.

14:11.396 --> 14:12.558
Arlo.

14:21.489 --> 14:22.485
Loretta?

14:26.703 --> 14:27.699
Loretta?

14:40.008 --> 14:41.550
- Loretta?
<i>- Who is this?</i>

14:42.469 --> 14:44.129
What do you mean, "Who's this"?
Who the hell is this?

14:44.554 --> 14:48.468
This is Officer Riley, Lexington police.
Your turn.

14:48.725 --> 14:51.512
Well, Officer Riley, this is Deputy
US Marshal Raylan Givens.

14:51.644 --> 14:53.637
- Where's Loretta?
<i>- Yeah, it looks like she's gone.</i>

14:53.772 --> 14:54.851
What do you mean, gone?

14:54.981 --> 14:57.389
Parents left her alone a couple hours,
returned to find her missing.

14:57.525 --> 14:59.150
Called it in as a possible abduction.

14:59.527 --> 15:01.567
She left the cell,
so I'm checking the outgoing calls.

15:01.821 --> 15:03.363
I'll be there in a few.

15:04.449 --> 15:05.480
What was that about?

15:06.618 --> 15:09.025
Do you mind being a little late to work?

15:18.463 --> 15:20.455
Where's Ava? Where's Ava?

15:20.590 --> 15:21.918
Well, she's on the couch.

15:22.050 --> 15:23.959
Get that body off the road.

15:33.853 --> 15:35.264
I'm sorry.

15:37.482 --> 15:38.810
You're sorry?

15:40.026 --> 15:42.019
You told me to stay in the cellar.

15:42.737 --> 15:44.979
Baby, why didn't...
Why didn't you stay...

15:47.784 --> 15:49.326
Where's your doctor?

15:49.452 --> 15:50.827
On his way.

15:51.746 --> 15:53.822
- Why wasn't she in the cellar?
- She wouldn't stay down.

15:53.957 --> 15:56.661
- Well, you should have made her stay down!
- I know. I'm sorry, Boyd.

15:56.793 --> 15:58.121
- You're sorry?
- I know.

15:58.753 --> 16:01.042
I'm sorry, Boyd. It was.
I know. I know. I know.

16:01.881 --> 16:03.340
Who shot her?

16:03.466 --> 16:05.957
- It was Dickie Bennett.
- Did you see him?

16:06.135 --> 16:07.131
It's what she said.

16:19.399 --> 16:21.771
I need you to find me Dickie Bennett.

16:21.985 --> 16:24.143
Neighbour down the block had her eyes
on a car she didn't like,

16:24.279 --> 16:25.821
hanging around out
in front of the house.

16:25.947 --> 16:27.192
How nosy did she get?

16:27.323 --> 16:29.945
Brown sedan, license pings back
to a Wade Messer.

16:30.201 --> 16:32.028
No address,
just a rural route in Harlan County.

16:32.161 --> 16:33.786
Anybody see her near the car?

16:33.913 --> 16:35.028
No.

16:36.583 --> 16:39.204
- Call Trooper Tom Bergen down in Harlan.
- Sure. I know Tom.

16:39.335 --> 16:41.043
He knows the girl's history.
He could be helpful.

16:41.171 --> 16:42.166
I'll do that.

16:52.265 --> 16:54.139
Okay. Police are gone.

16:54.809 --> 16:57.478
I saw you talking to the officer,
ducking his eyes.

16:57.604 --> 17:01.601
Whatever you felt like you couldn't say
in their presence, now you can.

17:01.858 --> 17:03.767
Sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

17:03.902 --> 17:06.143
Stop. Glen, I don't want you
to speak any more,

17:07.155 --> 17:08.483
'cause once you start lying to me,

17:08.615 --> 17:10.772
there's gonna be a river between us
with no bridge to cross.

17:10.909 --> 17:13.530
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Nod if you do.

17:14.078 --> 17:16.700
Okay. Good. Start again.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.203
I've lived a righteous life since
I've come up to Lexington.

17:22.337 --> 17:25.088
I got my affairs in order.
I make it to my meetings.

17:25.214 --> 17:27.705
I'm a good father, and
I work hard, Marshal.

17:28.384 --> 17:29.380
But?

17:29.594 --> 17:33.129
Years back, I did a piece for burglary
and trespass over in South Carolina.

17:33.264 --> 17:34.758
Fifteen years now since I've been out.

17:35.141 --> 17:37.632
And what? You don't want anything
to happen to the kids

17:37.769 --> 17:39.512
over some chicken-shit from your past?

17:40.271 --> 17:44.648
Thing is, got kids around,
all you can do is protect them.

17:45.443 --> 17:48.016
You feel this, like, natural pull.

17:48.154 --> 17:49.185
You bought a gun.

17:49.322 --> 17:52.572
A little Smith & Wesson .38 I got
at a gun show a couple years back.

17:52.700 --> 17:53.945
Kept it in the closet for protection.

17:54.077 --> 17:55.619
Where's that gun now, Glen?

17:57.038 --> 17:58.283
I don't know.

17:58.414 --> 18:00.324
It was there last night,
and now it's gone,

18:01.042 --> 18:04.375
along with about $300
I saved in a drawer for emergencies.

18:15.223 --> 18:16.219
What?

18:18.309 --> 18:21.061
Deal didn't include me
paying for your gas on top, Messer.

18:21.187 --> 18:24.971
Well, we're gonna have to live here, 'cause
I ain't got no other way to pay for it.

18:37.495 --> 18:39.238
- Hey.
- Thank you.

18:48.464 --> 18:50.623
- Tell me, Retty, what do you got in that bag?
- What the hell, man?

18:50.758 --> 18:52.300
What you got in that bag, Retty?

18:52.593 --> 18:55.263
- It ain't none of your concern.
- Hell it ain't. You got a piece in there.

18:55.930 --> 18:58.848
Why are you dragging a gun
down to Harlan, girl?

18:59.267 --> 19:01.722
You tell me right now, Loretta,
or this ship don't sail.

19:02.603 --> 19:04.726
I aim to find what happened
to my daddy. That's all.

19:06.024 --> 19:07.566
Are you out of your goddamn mind?

19:08.860 --> 19:10.318
You roll into Harlan with a gun,

19:10.445 --> 19:12.236
asking questions about
what happened to Walt,

19:12.363 --> 19:14.155
what do you think is gonna happen?

19:14.991 --> 19:17.114
You ain't got to worry about it.
You're getting paid.

19:17.994 --> 19:19.073
Paid?

19:19.203 --> 19:23.331
There ain't enough money in this world
worth crossing the Bennetts over.

19:24.667 --> 19:26.411
I thought you already knew that.

19:27.754 --> 19:30.079
Just get me as far as the county line.
That's all I'm asking.

19:30.339 --> 19:31.834
Hell no. This stops right here.

19:31.966 --> 19:33.508
We're going to Lexington
while we still have a shot.

19:33.634 --> 19:35.960
Messer, don't you put this car in gear.

19:39.807 --> 19:43.472
You make me pull my hand out of this bag,
you might not like what it comes up with.

19:45.772 --> 19:47.895
All right. You the boss.

19:52.779 --> 19:54.522
I considered your daddy a friend.

19:55.656 --> 19:58.029
We wasn't close,
but I held him in some regard.

19:58.951 --> 20:01.656
And that's the only reason
why I agreed to carry you down here.

20:03.122 --> 20:05.660
I've come this far, Messer.
I will see this thing through.

20:08.795 --> 20:10.621
I owe Daddy that much.

20:33.069 --> 20:34.611
I'm sorry.

20:34.737 --> 20:35.982
Where are we going?

20:36.572 --> 20:38.446
I'm still gonna take you to work
and drop you off.

20:38.574 --> 20:39.689
And then?

20:39.826 --> 20:42.364
Then I got this thing
I need to deal with.

20:42.787 --> 20:45.194
Do you still plan
on picking me up from work?

20:45.331 --> 20:47.573
As soon as I'm done
with this thing, yes.

20:47.708 --> 20:49.915
- This thing in Harlan?
- Yeah.

20:50.420 --> 20:52.993
Well, we just attended a funeral
after you killed a guy

20:53.131 --> 20:56.334
whose family's been feuding
with your family for the past 70 years.

20:57.093 --> 20:58.884
Raylan, what if they took her?

20:59.303 --> 21:00.963
What if they did that to try
and pull you back in?

21:01.097 --> 21:02.757
- Nobody took the girl.
- You don't know that.

21:02.890 --> 21:04.515
She's got a gun. She's got money.

21:04.642 --> 21:07.050
She's likely going down there
to avenge her daddy's murder.

21:07.186 --> 21:08.182
How can you be so sure?

21:08.312 --> 21:10.388
Because that's what I would have done
when I was her age.

21:11.732 --> 21:13.772
Winona, what do you want me to do?

21:13.901 --> 21:15.609
Do you want me just
to leave this alone?

21:15.736 --> 21:17.812
Yeah. I want you to leave this alone.

21:17.947 --> 21:20.782
I want you to leave it to the authorities.
This is not your problem, Raylan.

21:20.908 --> 21:23.234
- She's a 14-year-old girl.
- I know.

21:25.079 --> 21:26.823
It's not your problem.

21:28.749 --> 21:29.745
Please.

21:31.127 --> 21:32.123
Not today.

21:32.378 --> 21:36.506
Winona, I promise you I will be fine.

21:42.763 --> 21:44.555
Okay. Take me to work.

21:45.391 --> 21:47.051
And go to Harlan.

21:47.477 --> 21:50.561
But I can't promise you I'm gonna
be here when you get back.

22:10.499 --> 22:11.698
How you boys doing?

22:12.710 --> 22:13.873
Comfortable?

22:15.546 --> 22:17.539
There's a goddamn war going on.
Anybody tell you that?

22:18.674 --> 22:20.299
Mooney, you believe this shit?

22:20.426 --> 22:22.419
Well, you get what you pay for.
That's a fact.

22:22.553 --> 22:25.305
What's the trouble out here, Doyle?
Where's Mama?

22:26.807 --> 22:27.803
Mama!

22:28.559 --> 22:30.599
These rodeo clowns
your idea of security?

22:30.853 --> 22:33.427
Sitting around smoking, drinking,
playing with themselves?

22:33.564 --> 22:36.933
Why don't you just cool yourself down?
Ain't nobody got by them yet.

22:37.401 --> 22:38.599
Mama, I thought you'd want to know.

22:38.736 --> 22:42.070
The state troopers put out a
BOLO watch on Wade Messer.

22:42.198 --> 22:43.312
Raylan Givens's doing the looking.

22:44.033 --> 22:45.408
Messer's heading this way.

22:45.785 --> 22:47.528
He's got that McCready girl with him.

22:48.371 --> 22:50.447
- Loretta?
- Yes, ma'am.

22:51.415 --> 22:52.447
What are you doing about it?

22:52.583 --> 22:55.253
Well, my boys got their eyes peeled,
just like them troopers.

22:55.378 --> 22:57.785
Dickie, you get on up to Rabbit Holler,
and you wait for them.

22:57.922 --> 23:00.128
- Rabbit Holler? But what if he ain't...
- Don't "what if" me.

23:00.258 --> 23:02.546
- You get Loretta, and you bring her here.
- Mama, I'm just trying

23:02.677 --> 23:04.420
to get a word in edgewise to say,
what if he ain't got her?

23:04.553 --> 23:08.172
Well, you find out where she is,
and you get her! Now!

23:08.975 --> 23:10.173
Okay. I'm going.

23:10.309 --> 23:12.598
And you be damn sure
no harm comes to that girl.

23:22.572 --> 23:23.567
Boyd.

23:27.994 --> 23:29.369
- This your doctor?
- Yep.

23:29.495 --> 23:31.535
- What are you, a med student?
- I'm a doctor.

23:31.664 --> 23:33.538
I run a free clinic in Corbin.

23:34.458 --> 23:36.083
You run a clinic, what
are you doing this for?

23:36.210 --> 23:38.666
Because the clinic needs money
and you're gonna give us a lot of it.

23:40.381 --> 23:44.295
You fix her as if your life depended
on it, 'cause it surely does.

23:46.679 --> 23:49.549
- You don't leave her side.
- You got it.

23:53.144 --> 23:54.852
Tom, got anything?

23:54.979 --> 23:57.185
<i>I got a call about Loretta from
the Lexington PD.</i>

23:57.315 --> 24:00.066
- Yeah. Put a BOLO out?
<i>- As soon as I hung up.</i>

24:00.484 --> 24:02.228
Anybody spots Messer,
they're gonna give you a call.

24:02.486 --> 24:03.482
Okay.

24:05.823 --> 24:07.816
Well, you got everything you need?

24:08.701 --> 24:11.488
- Winona!
- Art. Can we talk?

24:12.246 --> 24:13.575
Sure.

24:14.248 --> 24:19.325
Now, dear, as fond as I am of you,
I hope this is not about Glynco.

24:19.462 --> 24:21.953
No.
Raylan went to Harlan this morning.

24:22.465 --> 24:26.297
He seems to think Loretta's in trouble
or that she's gonna get herself in trouble.

24:29.263 --> 24:31.588
Art, he went back to Harlan. There
are people there who want him dead.

24:32.016 --> 24:33.391
I imagine he's aware of that.

24:33.517 --> 24:34.762
Well, the Marshals need to help.

24:36.562 --> 24:41.438
Winona, whatever Raylan is doing
over there is on his personal time.

24:42.068 --> 24:45.567
Art, please. Come on.
You got to help him.

24:49.158 --> 24:51.364
Sometimes you just can't help.

25:29.907 --> 25:31.152
Wade Messer.

25:33.285 --> 25:34.365
Raylan Givens.

25:34.995 --> 25:36.573
Damn! Raylan!

25:36.997 --> 25:38.575
- How you doing?
- Just fine.

25:39.583 --> 25:41.991
Good. Good.
Where's Loretta McCready?

25:43.045 --> 25:44.041
Loretta?

25:44.505 --> 25:46.581
Well, she called, looking for a ride.

25:46.716 --> 25:48.755
Her daddy was a friend, so I obliged.

25:49.218 --> 25:51.045
I'm gonna ask you to
put the hammer down

25:51.178 --> 25:53.420
and keep your hands
where I can see them.

25:53.639 --> 25:56.391
Sure.
So, how you been keeping yourself?

25:56.767 --> 26:00.302
Pretty good, joined the Marshals
Service. Where is she now?

26:01.021 --> 26:05.683
Gas stop. Marshals Service, huh?
Boy, I'd have never guessed that.

26:07.653 --> 26:10.488
I'm gonna check you for weapons.
Then you can show me which gas stop.

26:10.614 --> 26:12.239
- You mind if we take your car?
- No.

26:15.536 --> 26:17.529
Right there. Nobody gonna tell me
that wasn't no base hit.

26:22.334 --> 26:24.623
All right. That ain't going anywhere.

26:24.753 --> 26:26.378
I appreciate the help, there, Wade.

26:27.006 --> 26:30.706
Mr. Bennett, sir, if that girl had told me
what she was thinking of doing,

26:30.843 --> 26:32.882
- I'd have called you, first thing.
- No harm, no foul, my friend.

26:33.012 --> 26:34.885
But, listen, I'm gonna
need you to do something for me, okay?

26:35.014 --> 26:37.256
- What's that? You name it.
- Need you to get your ass back out there

26:37.391 --> 26:38.850
and find that girl.
Will you do that for me?

26:38.976 --> 26:40.518
- Yes, sir.
- Okay. Listen to me.

26:40.644 --> 26:43.218
You find that girl, all will be forgiven.

26:43.481 --> 26:44.809
- Yes, sir.
- Now, go on.

26:46.442 --> 26:47.438
Go on.

26:49.612 --> 26:52.778
Well, how you doing,
there, Raylan? Huh?

26:53.491 --> 26:55.530
I bet you'd like a handful of aspirin
for that headache

26:55.659 --> 26:56.739
right about now, wouldn't you?

26:56.869 --> 26:57.984
Where's Loretta?

26:58.120 --> 27:01.323
Wade told me Loretta offered him
$150 to bring her back.

27:01.499 --> 27:03.990
Then Doyle heard on the police radio
that you had them

27:04.126 --> 27:06.534
on some kind of watch list,
and what do you know?

27:06.670 --> 27:09.458
Here we both are.
It's the top of the first, Raylan.

27:09.715 --> 27:13.582
Hey, batter, batter, batter, batter,
batter, batter, batter, swing!

27:13.803 --> 27:15.380
Oh, shit!

27:15.596 --> 27:18.301
Foul ball! Strike one.

27:18.933 --> 27:20.759
Sounded like it hurt, though. Yeah.

27:20.893 --> 27:22.684
She's here to find the people
who killed her daddy.

27:22.811 --> 27:24.187
Better do some stretching here.

27:24.313 --> 27:27.397
Yeah. Coach always said,
"Make sure you warm up first."

27:27.525 --> 27:29.850
- Your coach tell you that, Raylan?
- You're not concerned?

27:30.319 --> 27:33.190
No. He dropped her off at a gas station
about 60 miles from here.

27:33.781 --> 27:35.441
- What?
- You know, I was gonna tell you.

27:35.574 --> 27:40.450
I was reading somewhere that a person takes
something like 6-7,000 steps a day.

27:40.579 --> 27:42.121
You believe that? A day.

27:42.248 --> 27:43.872
Go back to the part about you reading.

27:43.999 --> 27:46.953
So funny. But think about that, Raylan.
Seven thousand...

27:47.086 --> 27:48.414
Hey, look at me when
I'm talking to you.

27:48.546 --> 27:49.956
That number...

27:50.464 --> 27:52.208
Seven thousand steps a day.

27:52.341 --> 27:55.840
Seven thousand steps a day for,
let's say, 20 years or so.

27:55.970 --> 27:58.805
Come on! Come on! Twenty years.
What's that come out to, Raylan?

27:58.931 --> 28:00.176
I don't know.

28:00.307 --> 28:02.300
You still got yourself a damn
big number. And listen to me.

28:02.434 --> 28:06.302
- That is what I figure you owe me, Raylan...
- Okay.

28:06.438 --> 28:09.012
For every step I've had to take on this

28:10.192 --> 28:12.814
ragged-ass knee going back
20 years, Raylan.

28:12.945 --> 28:14.108
Come on, Raylan! Speak up.

28:14.238 --> 28:17.274
I know you got something smart
you want to say about that.

28:17.449 --> 28:18.481
I know you do.

28:19.618 --> 28:20.614
No?

28:21.203 --> 28:22.697
Yeah. I understand, Raylan.

28:22.830 --> 28:25.665
It's not quite the same when you
don't have a gun to my head, is it?

28:26.584 --> 28:29.668
Hey, batter, batter, batter,
batter, batter, batter, batter...

28:32.590 --> 28:34.712
Oh, no, no! My heavens.

28:35.426 --> 28:37.502
Strike two! But you know what?

28:37.636 --> 28:39.712
This? This ain't
no three-strikes game, Raylan.

28:39.888 --> 28:44.716
No. No.
I get as many swings as it takes.

28:45.019 --> 28:46.643
Hey! Batter, batter...

28:46.770 --> 28:49.059
Raylan, I don't know whether
to shoot him now

28:49.189 --> 28:51.312
or let him have a couple of
more swings, then kill him.

28:52.735 --> 28:54.110
I vote for the first one.

28:54.236 --> 28:58.400
Dickie, take both them guns out of your
belt and put them on the ground right now.

28:58.532 --> 28:59.730
Right now!

29:02.161 --> 29:03.988
I'd be much obliged
if you'd cut me down.

29:04.121 --> 29:05.117
Cut him down.

29:05.873 --> 29:07.367
Now, God damn it.

29:11.503 --> 29:13.626
Now, Raylan, you said whatever needed
doing with Dickie,

29:16.133 --> 29:17.296
you were gonna take care of.

29:18.177 --> 29:20.253
Yeah. I'm sorry, Boyd.

29:22.473 --> 29:25.142
Your decision has caused me great pain.

29:25.517 --> 29:27.225
- It's complicated.
- No, it ain't.

29:31.732 --> 29:33.855
I'm gonna ask you to
leave now, Raylan.

29:36.820 --> 29:39.691
Raylan. Hey. You can't just leave me.

29:40.199 --> 29:42.571
I know you ain't just gonna
leave me here, Raylan.

29:42.701 --> 29:47.577
Dickie, I didn't pull the trigger, but
I'll sleep like a baby knowing he will.

29:53.962 --> 29:55.373
And my gun?

29:57.883 --> 29:59.377
Where I'm going, I'm gonna need it.

30:01.637 --> 30:02.633
Raylan.

30:03.514 --> 30:06.301
Raylan, hey. Wait, Raylan. Please.

30:06.684 --> 30:08.842
Wait, Raylan! Come on. Listen to me.

30:08.978 --> 30:11.469
You ain't getting to Loretta
without me, and you know it.

30:11.605 --> 30:14.689
Ain't no way you're getting past
Doyle and his gun thugs, man!

30:15.275 --> 30:16.520
Come on!

30:17.152 --> 30:18.563
You need me, Raylan!

30:23.075 --> 30:24.238
Boyd?

30:28.497 --> 30:29.660
He shot Ava.

30:32.167 --> 30:33.163
How bad?

30:33.711 --> 30:35.121
Raylan, that's not the point.

30:36.130 --> 30:37.754
I'm gonna need him for a little bit.

30:40.801 --> 30:44.051
What, are you asking me
or are you telling me?

30:45.472 --> 30:48.972
Makes you feel better,
you can tell people I asked.

31:10.080 --> 31:11.076
Hey.

31:11.999 --> 31:13.161
Hey yourself.

31:13.667 --> 31:14.663
You lost?

31:15.627 --> 31:18.545
Come to see Mags.
You gonna let me by or what?

31:18.756 --> 31:20.250
Don't believe I am.

31:20.382 --> 31:22.126
How about you turn
your narrow ass around,

31:22.259 --> 31:24.667
head back down that hill
before you get hurt?

31:24.803 --> 31:26.048
Mama.

31:27.765 --> 31:29.923
Cal! Let her through.

31:44.072 --> 31:45.068
Loretta.

31:46.283 --> 31:47.658
Miss Mags.

31:50.746 --> 31:53.949
Sweet Lord.
What brought you back here?

31:55.459 --> 31:57.202
I come to see you.

31:57.920 --> 32:00.161
Well, we better get you inside.

32:00.631 --> 32:03.916
Bad things are fixing to happen.
Come with me.

32:07.679 --> 32:11.926
You come at a difficult time, Loretta.
I can't paint any different picture of it.

32:13.143 --> 32:16.144
But I'm glad you came, nonetheless.

32:18.690 --> 32:20.482
You thirsty, darling?

32:22.903 --> 32:24.066
No, ma'am.

32:25.531 --> 32:28.401
Didn't come for refreshments.

32:36.375 --> 32:38.996
You came to talk about your daddy?

32:48.303 --> 32:49.299
Hey.

32:52.641 --> 32:56.970
Someday, when you got tads of your
own, you'll understand, Loretta.

32:57.896 --> 33:01.811
You do what you must to protect them,
even when you know it's wrong.

33:03.068 --> 33:06.567
And what Coover did to your daddy,
that was wrong.

33:12.578 --> 33:14.036
Honey.

33:16.999 --> 33:19.287
What have they been telling you?

33:22.170 --> 33:26.832
Doyle, I need you and your boys
to put your guns down.

33:27.342 --> 33:28.457
And why would we do that?

33:28.594 --> 33:31.594
Maybe you don't want to see your
brother's brains fly through the air.

33:31.972 --> 33:33.003
Is she here?

33:33.265 --> 33:34.344
- Who?
- Loretta.

33:34.766 --> 33:36.640
Maybe she is. Maybe she ain't.

33:36.935 --> 33:38.429
Maybe you can kiss my ass.

33:38.729 --> 33:40.271
Doyle, the girl's got a gun.

33:40.647 --> 33:42.355
Yeah. Who doesn't?

33:51.116 --> 33:52.112
Sugar,

33:53.994 --> 33:56.485
you think this is the first time
I had a pistol pointed at me?

33:59.374 --> 34:02.245
And by some steadier hands
than yours, I reckon.

34:02.377 --> 34:04.287
Might have held one or two myself.

34:06.381 --> 34:08.172
So I know how it feels.

34:11.887 --> 34:14.092
So heavy in your hands,

34:15.056 --> 34:16.882
they start to shaking.

34:18.560 --> 34:21.976
Then you realise you're not
gonna pull the trigger.

34:24.399 --> 34:27.103
And when you do, it's like a relief.

34:33.574 --> 34:34.820
Don't shoot!

34:36.036 --> 34:38.360
Guys! Cease fire! Knuckleheads.

34:39.623 --> 34:40.619
You all right?

34:40.748 --> 34:42.159
You shot at me!

34:48.422 --> 34:50.630
This bullet's been on
its way for 20 years.

34:52.594 --> 34:53.590
No!

34:55.179 --> 34:57.386
<i>Drop your weapons and
get on the ground!</i>

34:58.308 --> 35:00.135
<i>Drop your weapons, or
you will be shot.</i>

35:01.144 --> 35:02.852
<i>Assume the position! Now!</i>

35:02.980 --> 35:04.522
Hands up! Hands up!

35:04.648 --> 35:06.890
<i>Do you dumbass peckerwoods
understand English?</i>

35:07.025 --> 35:09.267
<i>On the ground, hillbillies, now!</i>

35:12.280 --> 35:13.775
Raylan, you okay?

35:14.574 --> 35:16.152
I've been better.

35:17.411 --> 35:18.786
It's good to see you, Art.

35:20.706 --> 35:23.825
I got at least two inside,
one being Loretta McCready.

35:25.544 --> 35:28.035
Tim, Rachel, go with him.
Secure the house.

35:36.972 --> 35:37.968
Loretta?

35:40.600 --> 35:43.008
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

35:44.646 --> 35:45.642
Sit down.

35:48.817 --> 35:52.186
How about I just lean against
this doorjamb for a little bit?

35:55.032 --> 35:56.407
You okay?

35:58.410 --> 36:02.573
Yeah, just took a bullet
in the exchange outside.

36:05.584 --> 36:07.375
How about you tell me
what's going on in here?

36:08.003 --> 36:11.372
I'm tired of people telling me
as much truth as they see fit.

36:15.135 --> 36:17.293
I want to know who
really killed my daddy.

36:21.058 --> 36:24.842
It breaks my heart seeing
you hold that gun.

36:27.105 --> 36:29.477
I wanted to keep you
away from this life.

36:31.151 --> 36:34.484
I wanted to let you be a
child a little longer.

36:36.656 --> 36:40.785
Wasn't Coover who did it. It was me.

36:45.248 --> 36:47.490
Because he called the police
about the pervert?

36:48.668 --> 36:49.949
That's right.

36:51.296 --> 36:55.294
But I tried to make it up to you
by giving you a better life here.

36:55.425 --> 36:56.421
I had a life!

36:57.094 --> 36:59.667
- Me and my daddy were just fine!
- No, you weren't.

36:59.805 --> 37:01.596
- Shut up!
- Okay, Loretta.

37:02.224 --> 37:05.924
You got the answer you were
looking for. Now put the gun down.

37:09.356 --> 37:11.064
I got to do this.

37:11.942 --> 37:14.100
No. You don't.

37:14.611 --> 37:19.487
You know, the Marshal and me,
we made our choices.

37:20.742 --> 37:24.989
Now we're paying for them,
but you still got a chance.

37:26.373 --> 37:29.872
What wouldn't you say right now
to keep me from shooting you?

37:30.001 --> 37:31.164
She's right.

37:33.505 --> 37:34.668
Loretta, look here, huh?

37:40.178 --> 37:41.174
She's right.

37:42.180 --> 37:45.549
You pull that trigger,
your life is gonna change.

37:47.394 --> 37:48.971
And not for the better.

37:52.858 --> 37:56.523
Now, I want you to ask yourself
what your daddy would want you to do.

38:01.908 --> 38:04.280
I want him here to tell me.

38:07.914 --> 38:09.788
Killing Mags ain't
gonna bring him back.

38:17.716 --> 38:19.210
Come on, now.

38:40.989 --> 38:41.985
Rachel?

38:44.826 --> 38:46.700
Tim, give me a minute.

38:51.625 --> 38:54.080
You got something to say?

38:54.836 --> 38:56.544
Doyle's dead.

38:59.424 --> 39:00.420
Doyle?

39:04.262 --> 39:05.673
What about Dickie?

39:06.681 --> 39:08.508
He's in custody.

39:13.647 --> 39:15.022
Thought you'd like to know.

39:18.485 --> 39:20.193
I appreciate it.

39:26.409 --> 39:28.069
You like a drink?

39:30.038 --> 39:31.449
Apple pie?

39:36.336 --> 39:37.499
Ease the pain.

39:42.509 --> 39:43.671
Yeah.

40:21.339 --> 40:23.581
It's good as I remembered.

40:28.346 --> 40:32.759
Figure we should end this feud now the way
it should have ended a long time ago.

40:34.519 --> 40:35.978
I guess.

40:47.907 --> 40:50.196
Mags? What did you do?

40:53.621 --> 40:56.243
Same thing I did to Loretta's daddy.

40:58.585 --> 40:59.581
It's too late.

41:01.171 --> 41:04.789
It was already in the
glass, not in the jar.

41:10.055 --> 41:11.846
This is the hard part.

41:23.318 --> 41:25.394
Put an end to my troubles.

41:30.075 --> 41:32.032
Get to see my boys again.

41:38.750 --> 41:41.122
Get to know the mystery.
