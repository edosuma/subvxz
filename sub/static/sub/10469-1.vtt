01:20.759 --> 01:22.679
Oh, God.

01:24.119 --> 01:26.037
There you go.
Why didn't you wake me?

01:26.038 --> 01:28.356
I did. You told me to piss off.
I don't remember.

01:28.357 --> 01:31.597
I do. All the clocks have stopped in
the house.

01:31.598 --> 01:34.798
It's probably just a fuse.
Oh, Mum, I've got a temperature.

01:34.799 --> 01:37.037
You haven't.
I'm not going.

01:37.038 --> 01:40.198
If I have to, you have to. Doesn't
she? Not getting involved.

01:40.199 --> 01:41.678
Ooh-ooh!
Hi, Mum.

01:41.679 --> 01:44.717
Morning, Liz.
Fresh eggs, we had a bumper lay.

01:44.718 --> 01:46.999
Look at them, eh? Love you zillions.
OK.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.758
- Er... oi!
- Hello, love.

01:49.759 --> 01:51.717
I've got a temperature.
Have you now?

01:51.718 --> 01:53.957
She hasn't.
Gotta go. I'm late to meet Nige.

01:53.958 --> 01:56.638
Have you seen Danny? He forgot his
lunch. Already gone.

01:56.639 --> 01:59.319
All right. I'm late.
Cheerio, love.

02:08.398 --> 02:10.197
Get off!
All right, you lot?

02:10.198 --> 02:13.357
How's it going? All right? My first
day back at work, ask me later.

02:13.358 --> 02:15.837
Sports Day, isn't it? Show 'em what
you got. I will.

02:15.838 --> 02:18.838
We should get the lads out.
Definitely. I'll text you later.

02:18.839 --> 02:20.918
All right, Jen?

02:20.919 --> 02:22.957
Sorry, love. Sorry.

02:22.958 --> 02:25.516
Where were you for five-a-side last
Tuesday?

02:25.517 --> 02:27.557
Sorry. I had to go over to Lyme.

02:27.558 --> 02:30.238
Mate's band were playing.
No excuses next time, eh?

02:30.239 --> 02:32.238
Yeah.

02:32.758 --> 02:35.878
- Morning, ladies.
- All right, how are you?

02:36.599 --> 02:38.238
Hey.

02:38.239 --> 02:40.517
Morning, Oll.
All right, Mark? How's it going?

02:40.518 --> 02:43.196
Beautiful weather.
Sunshine and showers they reckon.

02:43.197 --> 02:45.916
How's your mum? Is she OK?
Not bad, thanks for asking.

02:45.917 --> 02:48.879
Pass on my love.
Yeah, will do, mate. Absolutely.

02:48.880 --> 02:52.238
Oi, don't you sneak past.
Knock, knock.

02:52.239 --> 02:54.076
All right, Maggie?
All right, Mark?

02:54.077 --> 02:57.839
Got your ad renewal for you there,
Mag. Ah, a week late.

02:57.840 --> 03:00.838
Oh, sorry, no-one's perfect, eh?

03:02.158 --> 03:04.158
Lovely morning for it.

03:05.919 --> 03:07.919
All right, Becca?

03:08.078 --> 03:10.836
Your hotel started
that tradesman's discount yet?

03:10.837 --> 03:14.198
You've gotta have class to eat here.
Class? I'm all class, me.

03:14.199 --> 03:16.198
Keep telling yourself that.

03:18.158 --> 03:21.558
You're late. Yeah, sorry, traffic's
really stacking up.

03:25.279 --> 03:28.119
There's all them lovely tourist girls
ripe for your picking.

03:28.120 --> 03:29.838
Shut up!

03:29.839 --> 03:32.039
So, what was the upshot of last
night, then?

03:34.358 --> 03:36.279
How about you just drive?

03:37.879 --> 03:41.278
Morning. You all right? Hi. Morning!

03:41.279 --> 03:44.237
Hi, I'm back!

03:44.238 --> 03:47.597
Thank you very much. Quite
right too.

03:47.598 --> 03:50.598
Dom, I got you lung busters,
against my better judgment.

03:50.599 --> 03:54.118
Nish. Look. Vodka, black label.

03:54.119 --> 03:56.276
Very nice. Thank you.
Not at all.

03:56.277 --> 03:59.437
Anna, I got you lip gloss for all
your kissing. Thank you.

03:59.438 --> 04:03.357
Mike... moisturiser. Give that lovely
face a lift. Thank you.

04:03.358 --> 04:06.197
I got you a cuddly penguin, Frank.
I know you get lonely.

04:06.198 --> 04:08.159
Come on, then. What's all the
gossip?

04:08.160 --> 04:11.598
Ellie. Welcome back. Can I have a
quick word?

04:13.759 --> 04:17.878
What's the news? We've given the job
to someone else.

04:17.879 --> 04:19.837
What?
I know it's a disappointment.

04:19.838 --> 04:23.078
You said it'd wait till I got back
from leave. You said I was a
shoo-in.

04:23.079 --> 04:25.719
The situation changed.
Christ!

04:27.318 --> 04:30.038
Who? Who got it?
DI Alec Hardy.

04:30.039 --> 04:32.198
A man?

04:32.199 --> 04:34.397
What happened to,
"The area needs a female DI"?

04:34.398 --> 04:36.238
What happened to I've got your
backing?

04:36.318 --> 04:39.876
Alec Hardy has a lot of experience.
Why do I know that name?

04:39.877 --> 04:42.178
He was in charge of the Sandbrook
murders.

04:42.189 --> 04:44.189
Are you kidding me?

04:45.989 --> 04:48.149
When does he start?
Last week.

04:50.389 --> 04:52.389
You wanna see this or not?

04:58.068 --> 05:01.508
Yep, OK. Received.

05:04.349 --> 05:07.549
That's where they cut to get in.
Siphoned the whole bloody tank.

05:09.749 --> 05:11.749
We'll be in touch.

05:13.309 --> 05:15.309
Is that it?

05:18.228 --> 05:20.228
What about forensics?

05:20.869 --> 05:22.786
I can't afford this, the price of
diesel.

05:22.787 --> 05:26.787
You called me at seven in the morning
for that. Too good for it, are you?

05:26.788 --> 05:30.586
Just got a call. Coastguard reported
something down by the shore.

05:30.587 --> 05:33.547
After all she said to me, what's the
bloody point?

05:33.548 --> 05:35.747
Shall I just walk out, clear my desk
and go?

05:35.748 --> 05:39.669
No, I know. But you should have seen
me, I was so happy coming back.

05:39.670 --> 05:41.227
I'm in here!

05:41.228 --> 05:43.349
Ellie, you've got a shout.

05:44.229 --> 05:45.309
Gotta go.

05:46.469 --> 05:49.868
Can you see Danny? I can't see him.
He'll be with his class.

05:51.229 --> 05:53.786
I can't believe you're making me
come to this.

05:53.787 --> 05:56.908
Hey, your choice. Stay here or get
on to your own school.

05:58.068 --> 06:00.826
Oh, all right. I'll go in.
I love you very much.

06:00.827 --> 06:04.148
And if you remember that smile
give it a go for me, would you?

06:10.348 --> 06:12.587
Usain Bolt. OK?

06:12.588 --> 06:14.588
Now all look egg-cited.

06:19.749 --> 06:22.108
Hiya.
All right?

06:23.109 --> 06:25.828
Beth? No Danny?

06:25.829 --> 06:28.949
Oh, I thought he was here.
No, we haven't seen him today.

06:30.389 --> 06:34.269
Well, did you do the register? Yeah,
we haven't seen him since yesterday.

06:34.270 --> 06:36.068
Miss?

06:41.668 --> 06:45.346
Danny, it's Mum. So, you're not at
school. Can you give me a call
straightaway?

06:45.347 --> 06:47.387
I just wanna know where you are.

06:47.388 --> 06:51.429
Jack, it's Beth. Danny did his paper
round this morning, right?

06:53.788 --> 06:56.109
Oh, er... OK. Did he ring?

06:58.109 --> 07:02.349
No, no, no, it's fine. I'm just...
just not quite sure where he is.

07:04.108 --> 07:06.028
Mark, it's me. Ring me now.

07:09.269 --> 07:11.269
Tom? Tom!

07:12.748 --> 07:15.669
Danny didn't say he was going
anywhere this morning, did he?

07:15.670 --> 07:17.227
He's not in trouble.

07:17.228 --> 07:19.668
OK. Thank you.
Can I do anything?

07:19.669 --> 07:22.348
Just give me a call if he shows up.
Yeah, sure.

07:23.829 --> 07:25.148
Hey, Tom.

07:39.509 --> 07:41.307
Oh, come on. Come on.

07:41.308 --> 07:43.586
Main road
to the coast at Broadchurch.

07:43.587 --> 07:46.948
If you are heading to the beach
I suggest you make other plans.

07:50.828 --> 07:53.867
What's going on? Someone said the
police are at the beach.

07:53.868 --> 07:55.348
They might have found a body.

08:25.469 --> 08:27.469
Stand back. Stand back, please.

08:30.948 --> 08:33.068
Oh, God, don't do this to me.

09:07.908 --> 09:09.629
Come on.

09:29.349 --> 09:31.507
Oh, God. No, no, no.
Off the beach.

09:31.508 --> 09:33.989
This area's off-limits.
No, I'm police.

09:35.028 --> 09:37.828
Oh, God, I know him. He lives here.

09:38.908 --> 09:41.466
He has tea at my house.
He's my boy's best friend.

09:41.467 --> 09:44.107
Oh, God, Beth. Does Beth know?
All right, calm down.

09:44.108 --> 09:46.746
You don't understand. I know that
boy. Shut it off.

09:46.747 --> 09:49.866
"Shut it off"? Be professional.
You're working a case now.

09:49.867 --> 09:51.667
Alec Hardy.
I know. You got my job.

09:51.668 --> 09:54.229
You wanna do that now?
You don't even know who he is.

09:54.230 --> 09:56.229
Tell me!

09:57.468 --> 10:01.269
Danny. Daniel Latimer. 11 years old.
Goes to school with my boy Tom.

10:01.829 --> 10:04.466
His family live here. Dad's the
local plumber.

10:04.467 --> 10:07.069
Is this a suicide spot?
He wouldn't do that.

10:07.709 --> 10:09.708
Answer the question.

10:10.068 --> 10:14.027
There are others - one three miles
west; another one further inland.

10:14.028 --> 10:16.347
He's not that type of kid.
Find out where SOCO are.

10:16.348 --> 10:18.549
We have to move fast. That tide'll be
in.

10:38.348 --> 10:40.149
Oh, God.

11:00.468 --> 11:02.347
Oh, God. Who's that?

11:02.348 --> 11:05.226
No, Beth, get off the beach.
What have you found?

11:05.227 --> 11:07.629
Let me see, let me see.
You can't be here!

11:07.948 --> 11:10.748
Stop. Get her off the beach. Get
away. Those are his shoes.

11:10.749 --> 11:14.667
Come on, come on.
Those are Danny's trainers!

11:14.668 --> 11:16.869
No!

11:20.588 --> 11:22.189
Danny!

11:48.390 --> 11:51.230
Ah, Olly, you're back.
Survived Sports Day.

11:51.325 --> 11:53.323
Not only that - coffees.

11:53.341 --> 11:55.300
Ah.
That's three shots.

11:55.301 --> 12:00.300
Double-page spread. Spell all the
children's names correctly, please.

12:00.365 --> 12:02.725
I don't want the parents berating me.

12:02.726 --> 12:06.804
So, Reg didn't turn up. Red Lion.

12:06.805 --> 12:09.085
What, you mean we've got no pictures?
Ah.

12:09.086 --> 12:12.204
Camera phone. I took them myself.

12:12.205 --> 12:15.205
Ah... good initiative, Olly.

12:16.765 --> 12:18.765
Show me how to download these.

12:24.085 --> 12:26.763
Why do still use Reg?
He always lets you down.

12:26.764 --> 12:31.085
I see Reg in the supermarket every
Saturday. We look after our own here.

12:31.086 --> 12:33.605
Oh, look at their little faces.

12:34.725 --> 12:38.365
Oh, that's very nice. You've almost
got an eye.

12:39.445 --> 12:42.443
I tell Reg I'm using camera phone
pictures in the paper.

12:42.444 --> 12:44.605
He'll be back and sober within the
hour.

12:50.045 --> 12:53.245
Oh, my God. It's the Daily Mail.
It's my application.

12:54.925 --> 12:56.645
Open it.

13:01.125 --> 13:02.964
Bastards!

13:03.037 --> 13:04.597
Oh, sweetheart.

13:05.917 --> 13:09.275
There's plenty of other newspapers.
I've tried them all now.

13:09.276 --> 13:11.677
You're good, petal. Your time will
come.

13:18.477 --> 13:20.477
Now, look, text from Yvonne.

13:21.317 --> 13:24.237
She says the beach is closed off
for some reason.

13:25.357 --> 13:27.757
Go down, check it out, will you?
Get some fresh air.

13:29.557 --> 13:31.357
Sure.

13:38.917 --> 13:41.835
They let people walk along
here, no safety barriers?

13:41.836 --> 13:44.437
It's a coastal path. People know to
be careful.

13:45.009 --> 13:47.009
It's a death trap.

13:48.489 --> 13:51.967
How's it going? Well, from what we've
got up here, sir,

13:51.968 --> 13:55.127
it looks like the rock fall
around the body was faked.

13:55.128 --> 13:58.049
What do you mean?
The angle of the body was wrong.

13:58.050 --> 13:59.568
It was too arranged.

13:59.569 --> 14:02.129
And up here there's no flattened
grass or slippage.

14:02.130 --> 14:05.248
No loose rocks. No fibres, no hand
marks.

14:05.249 --> 14:08.209
No sense of a downward trajectory.
You mean he didn't fall?

14:08.729 --> 14:10.127
Could he have jumped?

14:10.128 --> 14:14.009
That's unlikely, sir, given where he
was found and the trajectory
off the cliffs.

14:14.010 --> 14:15.688
See, not Danny.

14:15.689 --> 14:19.009
If you ask me... someone tried to
make it look like an accident.

14:19.729 --> 14:21.729
I don't think he was up here.

14:36.449 --> 14:39.367
Get on to the pathologist. Tell him
to hurry up.

14:39.368 --> 14:41.369
Even if it is just preliminary.

14:43.769 --> 14:45.408
DS Miller!
Who's that?

14:45.409 --> 14:46.927
Just keep walking.
Ellie!

14:46.928 --> 14:48.727
He seems to know you.
Auntie Ellie.

14:48.728 --> 14:51.927
I told you, don't do that.
Olly Stevens, Broadchurch Echo.

14:51.928 --> 14:54.569
I was down at the other end.
Why has the beach been closed?

14:54.570 --> 14:56.408
No statements now.

14:56.409 --> 14:59.209
I heard there was a body. Has it
been ID'd?

14:59.689 --> 15:02.489
Please.
There will be a statement, Oliver.

15:22.529 --> 15:25.289
Are they all in there? Sir, I can
lead this with the family.

15:25.290 --> 15:26.768
No.

15:26.769 --> 15:29.527
I know them. How many deaths like
this have you worked?

15:29.528 --> 15:32.687
This is my first. You can't make it
better. Don't try.

15:32.688 --> 15:36.569
You don't know how I work.
Most likely premise is abduction.

15:36.570 --> 15:39.168
Was he taken? If so, who by?

15:39.169 --> 15:40.727
Watch them. Every movement.

15:40.728 --> 15:43.049
If anything doesn't make sense you
tell me.

15:43.409 --> 15:44.409
OK.

15:45.929 --> 15:47.929
Don't look at me like that.

16:20.129 --> 16:21.769
Morning.

16:23.169 --> 16:25.169
Morning.

16:26.289 --> 16:29.609
I'm Detective Inspector Alec Hardy
and you know DS Miller.

16:31.609 --> 16:35.049
Why don't you take a seat? We need
to talk about something. Yeah.

16:35.050 --> 16:37.088
Sit down.
Get a chair.

16:37.089 --> 16:38.889
Don't worry, I can do it.

16:53.329 --> 16:56.687
The body of a young boy was found...
It's Danny, isn't it?

16:56.688 --> 16:59.049
I saw his shoes.
Plenty of kids have those shoes.

16:59.050 --> 17:01.049
Sorry. You talk.

17:02.809 --> 17:04.809
We believe it's Danny's body.

17:06.049 --> 17:09.529
Who is it, Ellie? Was it him?

17:15.049 --> 17:17.049
Hey.

17:18.329 --> 17:20.329
Hey.

17:24.368 --> 17:26.049
Hey, it's all right.

17:26.569 --> 17:28.569
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

17:55.609 --> 17:58.889
Was it an accident? Did he fall?
We don't know yet.

18:00.889 --> 18:04.769
Can you think why he might have been
up on the cliffs last night
or this morning?

18:05.529 --> 18:08.207
He wouldn't have been.
Well, he obviously was.

18:08.208 --> 18:10.209
He didn't have any reason to be.

18:11.649 --> 18:14.167
How was Danny over the past few
days?

18:14.168 --> 18:17.049
He didn't kill himself
if that's what you're suggesting.

18:17.050 --> 18:20.089
He's been just... normal.

18:21.849 --> 18:25.889
He wouldn't kill himself. He knows
he can talk to us about anything.

18:26.289 --> 18:28.129
And you last saw him when?

18:30.289 --> 18:32.369
I looked in on him er...

18:32.769 --> 18:35.248
about nine o'clock last night.

18:35.249 --> 18:37.849
He was laid in bed reading.

18:41.169 --> 18:42.767
Anyone see Danny this morning?

18:42.768 --> 18:46.569
No. He was up and out before anyone
else. He's got a paper round.

18:48.169 --> 18:51.089
But he didn't turn up for that.
Jack, I spoke to him.

18:51.090 --> 18:53.089
He runs the paper shop.

18:55.169 --> 18:58.489
Any signs of forced entry
or disturbance round the house?

18:58.490 --> 19:00.489
No, nothing.

19:01.409 --> 19:03.409
I wanna see the body.

19:07.369 --> 19:09.209
You might be wrong about it being
him.

19:10.169 --> 19:12.809
So, I wanna be sure. I wanna see.

19:22.969 --> 19:25.649
How many times you done this, Ell?
I haven't.

19:27.329 --> 19:28.968
Thanks a lot.

19:28.969 --> 19:31.127
Mark! All right, buddy?
All right, Trev?

19:31.128 --> 19:33.729
What you in here for? Nothing
serious, I hope?

19:34.129 --> 19:36.207
Nah.
Sign this petition, will you?

19:36.208 --> 19:39.247
They're threatening to close this
place down. In a bit of a rush.

19:39.248 --> 19:42.209
Oh, come on. Won't take two seconds.
It's important.

19:42.769 --> 19:47.289
Ah, good man. Hey, coming to
skittles, the Lion on Tuesday?

19:47.809 --> 19:50.809
The Yetminster. Grudge match.
I don't know, mate.

19:51.529 --> 19:55.169
See how it goes, eh? Right. Give my
love to Beth and the kids.

21:20.489 --> 21:22.609
All this way I thought it wouldn't
be him.

21:27.089 --> 21:29.089
My Danny.

21:33.409 --> 21:35.889
Can I touch him, Ell?

21:40.969 --> 21:42.969
Why him, eh, Ell?

21:47.489 --> 21:49.769
He's only little, isn't he? He's
just...

21:52.489 --> 21:54.809
He's just my little boy, isn't he?

22:03.529 --> 22:05.529
Listen, boy.

22:07.049 --> 22:09.049
Er...

22:12.649 --> 22:15.489
I'm... I'm sorry that I
er...

22:18.609 --> 22:21.249
that I wasn't there for you and
er...

22:28.169 --> 22:30.169
You're... you're my...

22:30.689 --> 22:33.409
You're my boy, Danny, and I let you
down.

22:36.369 --> 22:38.369
I'm so, so sorry.

22:45.969 --> 22:47.969
I love you zillions, superstar.

22:52.849 --> 22:54.849
I always will.

23:07.329 --> 23:11.809
Was Danny Latimer abducted?
Did someone gain access to the house?

23:11.810 --> 23:13.848
If so, how?

23:13.849 --> 23:16.287
If it wasn't forced entry, who has
the key?

23:16.288 --> 23:19.809
We need to collect any CCTV
from a mile radius around the house.

23:20.769 --> 23:23.489
Miller - family.
Who are they and where were they?

23:25.409 --> 23:28.569
Beth had Chloe, their eldest
daughter, when she was 15.

23:28.570 --> 23:30.328
Mark was 17.

23:30.329 --> 23:33.087
Mum and daughter were at home
watching telly.

23:33.088 --> 23:36.127
They say they didn't leave the house
until school next morning.

23:36.128 --> 23:39.607
Dad was out on an emergency
call-out. He's a plumber.

23:39.608 --> 23:43.409
He got in around three. Neither
parent thought to check on Danny.

23:44.129 --> 23:48.169
Gran lives nearby. She was in all
evening. The other gran lives
in Wales.

23:49.289 --> 23:52.009
Until we're ready all of this remains
confidential.

23:52.609 --> 23:55.089
No gossip. Do you understand?

23:56.929 --> 23:58.929
All right. Go on.

24:00.169 --> 24:01.847
Given the nature of this case

24:01.848 --> 24:04.249
it makes sense to hand it on to
another lead officer.

24:04.369 --> 24:05.568
No.

24:05.569 --> 24:09.447
It's nothing to do with your
ability. We don't want Sandbrook
to become a thing.

24:09.448 --> 24:12.647
I was completely exonerated.
Alec, you came down here to lie low.

24:12.648 --> 24:14.567
I came to do whatever the job
requires.

24:14.568 --> 24:17.287
But in terms of public perception,
you may be vulnerable.

24:17.288 --> 24:20.809
I'm giving you the chance to step
back. Nobody will blame you.

24:22.209 --> 24:24.927
This happened
a stone's throw from your station.

24:24.928 --> 24:27.207
I've met your team. No-one's as
qualified as me.

24:27.208 --> 24:31.409
Sandbrook doesn't make me vulnerable.
It makes me the best man for the job.

24:33.649 --> 24:35.929
You wanna stop me, you're welcome to
try.

24:38.649 --> 24:40.649
Thanks for the 99.

24:51.752 --> 24:54.150
What did Jenkinson want?
Jenkinson?

24:54.151 --> 24:56.792
The Chief Super. I saw you walking
with her. No.

24:57.872 --> 25:01.872
I did, you were having 99s. Miller,
your son went to school with Danny.

25:01.899 --> 25:03.817
Does he know yet?
No.

25:03.818 --> 25:07.136
You need to talk to him.
Tomorrow. I'll tell him tonight.

25:07.137 --> 25:09.538
And, sir, do you mind not calling me
Miller?

25:09.858 --> 25:12.298
Why? I don't really like the surname
thing.

25:12.388 --> 25:14.387
I prefer Ellie.
Ellie.

25:16.067 --> 25:18.587
Ellie. No.

25:20.987 --> 25:22.865
Jack, we need to ask you a few
questions.

25:22.866 --> 25:25.067
Danny didn't turn up for his round
this morning?

25:25.907 --> 25:28.867
I assumed he was sick.
Did he often miss his round?

25:28.868 --> 25:31.347
They all do, one time or another.

25:34.387 --> 25:37.027
How was Danny yesterday?
No different from usual.

25:37.107 --> 25:39.425
You didn't notice anything on his
mind?

25:39.426 --> 25:43.307
He was only in here 15 minutes first
thing. I'm no psychiatrist.

25:43.308 --> 25:45.346
Are you married?
No.

25:45.347 --> 25:47.347
Are you?

25:49.027 --> 25:52.146
They brought him in here, Mark and
Beth.

25:52.147 --> 25:53.947
Three days old, he was.

25:55.387 --> 25:56.787
It's not right.

26:01.547 --> 26:05.067
What do you have? Superficial cuts
and bruises to the face.

26:06.227 --> 26:09.866
Traces of domestic cleaning fluid on
the skin.

26:09.867 --> 26:12.467
Cause of death was asphyxiation.

26:13.667 --> 26:15.626
He was strangled.

26:15.627 --> 26:18.627
Bruising to the neck and windpipe
and at the top of the spine.

26:19.227 --> 26:23.186
The pattern of bruises suggest large
hands.

26:23.187 --> 26:25.187
I'd suggest er... male.

26:26.667 --> 26:29.506
It erm... it would have been brutal.

26:29.507 --> 26:33.706
The angle suggests he would have
been facing his attacker.

26:33.707 --> 26:35.947
Er... He would have known.

26:36.387 --> 26:39.507
Any sexual violence?
Mercifully, no.

26:41.227 --> 26:42.986
The time of death?

26:42.987 --> 26:47.387
Er, I'd put it between 10pm Thursday
night and 4am Friday morning.

26:49.867 --> 26:51.867
Thank you.

26:53.227 --> 26:56.307
We don't get these around here.

26:57.587 --> 26:59.427
Make sure you find them.

27:31.107 --> 27:34.467
We have some preliminary
findings.

27:36.507 --> 27:39.387
We are treating Danny's death
as suspicious.

27:39.388 --> 27:41.586
Oh.

27:41.587 --> 27:43.465
We think he may have been killed.

27:43.466 --> 27:46.345
I should have checked on him
before I went to bed.

27:46.346 --> 27:48.585
If I'd checked...
Beth, this is not your fault.

27:48.586 --> 27:50.987
Whatever happened, this is not down
to you.

27:53.947 --> 27:55.586
I promise...

27:55.587 --> 27:57.587
we will find the person responsible.

27:57.588 --> 27:59.587
Oh, my God.

28:00.867 --> 28:02.587
You have my word.

28:05.667 --> 28:07.147
He's a little boy.

28:25.827 --> 28:27.827
Chlo, I don't know what to say.

28:28.747 --> 28:30.267
I know.

28:30.347 --> 28:32.346
It doesn't feel real.

28:32.347 --> 28:33.827
Are the police round?

28:33.907 --> 28:35.587
Come on, let's go. I want to do this.

28:35.588 --> 28:37.146
Seriously?

28:37.147 --> 28:38.706
What did they ask you?

28:38.707 --> 28:41.147
Do they know about us? Cos you ain't
16 yet.

28:41.148 --> 28:43.147
Nobody knows. Let's go.

28:58.027 --> 28:59.706
Are you OK?

28:59.707 --> 29:01.785
I'll be better once I've eaten
something.

29:01.786 --> 29:03.067
Do you want anything?

29:03.068 --> 29:05.067
No.

29:05.547 --> 29:07.627
Do you think other kids are in
danger?

29:08.627 --> 29:10.506
I don't know.

29:10.507 --> 29:12.507
Maybe.

29:28.547 --> 29:30.547
Are you sure you're OK?

29:32.427 --> 29:34.427
Do you want me to do it?

30:08.707 --> 30:09.866
Hello?

30:09.867 --> 30:11.145
Is it Danny Latimer?

30:11.146 --> 30:12.427
I can't talk to you.

30:12.507 --> 30:16.587
I've seen Chloe at the beach. It is,
isn't it? This isn't appropriate,
Oliver.

30:16.588 --> 30:19.627
It is him. Oh, my God. The poor kid.

30:20.147 --> 30:22.705
I did not confirm that. This is not a
confirmation.

30:22.706 --> 30:24.707
No, I understand, Auntie Ellie.

30:25.907 --> 30:26.907
Olly...

30:32.187 --> 30:34.306
Hi, it's Olly. Leave a message.

30:34.307 --> 30:36.545
Answer my bloody calls. I did not
confirm that.

30:36.546 --> 30:39.747
You cannot speculate about this
incident. Are we clear?

31:25.787 --> 31:28.065
Karen, you might want to see this.
Not now, Sam.

31:28.066 --> 31:32.225
I've this Department of Education
press release that's got to sound
like essential news.

31:32.226 --> 31:34.745
It's barely in English.
Who teaches these people?

31:34.746 --> 31:38.505
You said tell you if anything comes
on the local paper Twitter feeds.

31:38.506 --> 31:40.785
Go on, then, quick.
Body found on Dorset beach.

31:40.786 --> 31:43.025
Young boy, possible suspicious
death.

31:43.026 --> 31:45.307
OK. Have you got a link you can send
me?

31:45.308 --> 31:46.626
Already did.

31:46.627 --> 31:48.626
You already did.

31:48.627 --> 31:50.627
Thanks.

31:50.747 --> 31:53.985
This is how grateful I am. I'm going
to give you the last of my muffin.

31:53.986 --> 31:56.307
So how's it going?
Great. Two minutes.

32:20.427 --> 32:23.785
I'm going to take Danny's computer
away for examination.

32:23.786 --> 32:26.705
Will they get it back? Sure, as soon
as we've finished with it.

32:26.706 --> 32:28.745
It's got his stuff on it.
We'll be careful.

32:28.746 --> 32:30.185
Why have you released his name?

32:30.186 --> 32:31.945
Did you agree to that?
What?

32:31.946 --> 32:35.185
It's on Twitter. From the
Broadchurch Echo. Daniel Latimer.

32:35.186 --> 32:37.825
Why have they done that?
Talk to the officer in charge.

32:37.826 --> 32:39.825
Nobody told us this was going to
happen.

32:39.826 --> 32:41.827
Aren't they supposed to consult?

32:41.987 --> 32:43.987
How do you know anyway?

32:44.667 --> 32:48.065
I've got a Google alert
on "Broadchurch" and "death".

32:48.066 --> 32:51.425
Oh, for goodness' sake, Chloe!
Well, it's a good job I have

32:51.426 --> 32:54.467
otherwise we wouldn't have known.
Known what?

32:56.947 --> 32:58.947
For God's sake!

32:59.987 --> 33:02.106
Bloody Twitter!

33:02.107 --> 33:04.705
These people's lives have been
destroyed

33:04.706 --> 33:07.147
and now our incompetence has made it
worse.

33:08.267 --> 33:11.107
Think what we have to do now
to rebuild trust there.

33:12.747 --> 33:14.747
Who told the journalist?

33:20.227 --> 33:22.227
I think it might have been me.

33:26.027 --> 33:27.146
Your nephew?

33:27.147 --> 33:28.985
He saw Danny's sister at the beach.

33:28.986 --> 33:33.385
I didn't tell him anything. I told
him not to publish. He's a
little shit.

33:33.386 --> 33:36.347
I'll read the riot act and I'll
explain to the family.

33:38.147 --> 33:40.147
Go away.

33:42.587 --> 33:44.587
Shit, shit, shit, shit! Shit!

33:45.427 --> 33:47.427
Hi, Nick.
Ma'am.

33:59.170 --> 34:03.229
This is a short statement
to confirm that this morning

34:03.268 --> 34:07.548
the body of an 11-year-old child
was found on Harbour Cliff Beach

34:07.549 --> 34:09.867
at Broadchurch.

34:09.868 --> 34:13.706
The body was subsequently identified
as Daniel Latimer,

34:13.708 --> 34:15.746
who lived in the town.

34:15.748 --> 34:17.746
We are treating his death as
suspicious.

34:17.746 --> 34:22.306
Our investigations are continuing and
there'll be a full briefing later
this evening.

34:22.306 --> 34:26.987
We ask the media respect the family's
privacy at this time. Thank you.

34:26.989 --> 34:28.347
Can you believe it?

34:28.348 --> 34:30.545
He got another job even after
Sandbrook.

34:30.547 --> 34:33.306
Boss... Suspicious death.
Kid on Dorset beach.

34:33.306 --> 34:36.585
Gender? Age? Boy. 11. I want to go
down. There could be...

34:36.587 --> 34:39.505
Not for that. It's the wrong profile.
It'll cost too much.

34:39.507 --> 34:41.386
Let an agency do it. You can jazz it
up.

34:41.387 --> 34:45.108
Oh, come on, all I'm doing these
days is polishing press releases.

34:45.467 --> 34:47.148
Pretty please.

34:53.868 --> 34:55.507
Hello.
Hi.

34:55.507 --> 34:57.268
Long day?
Yeah.

35:00.788 --> 35:02.827
It's really tragic.

35:02.828 --> 35:07.388
Can't bear to think what the family
must be going through. We're all
in shock.

35:12.508 --> 35:15.908
Actually, do you think the beach
will be open tomorrow? I...

35:16.708 --> 35:19.506
Only so I know what to tell the
guests. I don't know.

35:19.507 --> 35:23.828
I've had an early check-out and
a cancellation just tonight. So...

35:26.788 --> 35:28.707
I'm going up.

35:28.708 --> 35:31.908
Oh, sorry, there's two people
waiting for you in the bar.

35:41.268 --> 35:43.307
Well, go on.

35:43.308 --> 35:46.708
I was wrong to post that news. I'm
sorry.

35:48.388 --> 35:51.788
I should hang him by the bollocks
from the town hall spire.

35:52.388 --> 35:55.028
All reporting on this will come
through me now.

35:55.029 --> 35:57.348
The Echo works with the police.

35:58.588 --> 36:01.428
I'll... I'll speak to the Latimer
family.

36:01.429 --> 36:03.788
Give them our apologies.

36:05.388 --> 36:07.388
Stay out of my way.

36:24.908 --> 36:26.908
Thanks for bringing me.

36:28.668 --> 36:30.948
I used to come down here when he was
a baby.

36:33.228 --> 36:35.108
Middle of the day, just me and him.

36:37.468 --> 36:39.708
I'd pick him up and dip him in the
waves.

36:40.908 --> 36:42.908
His little fat legs would be all
wet.

36:44.308 --> 36:46.388
God, he loved it. He laughed like
mad.

36:47.708 --> 36:49.708
I used to do the same with Tom.

36:49.948 --> 36:51.948
Does he know?

36:54.708 --> 36:56.747
Promise me, Ellie, because...

36:56.748 --> 37:00.188
I don't know your boss from Adam
and me and you go back...

37:00.908 --> 37:02.908
The boys go back.

37:03.348 --> 37:05.468
I'm counting on you to get them
caught.

37:05.868 --> 37:07.548
I swear.

37:10.068 --> 37:12.068
He did know, didn't he?

37:13.388 --> 37:15.388
That I loved him.

37:15.908 --> 37:17.507
Of course he did.

37:17.508 --> 37:20.188
He was a beautiful boy, Beth.
You don't deserve this.

37:20.189 --> 37:22.908
I just... I just feel... like...

37:23.908 --> 37:25.948
very far away from myself.

37:35.068 --> 37:37.107
Here's Mummy!

37:37.108 --> 37:39.828
Look at you still up.

37:40.108 --> 37:42.147
And eating yoghurt.

37:42.148 --> 37:44.468
You love yoghurt, especially wearing
it.

37:44.469 --> 37:48.707
I'm only here for a shower.
I've got to get back.

37:48.708 --> 37:50.187
Are things bad?

37:50.188 --> 37:52.188
Need a hug?

37:56.588 --> 37:58.628
How was your day?

37:59.548 --> 38:01.147
Or shouldn't I ask?

38:01.148 --> 38:04.986
Second go at tea. First one was
a bit of an apocalypse, wasn't it?

38:04.987 --> 38:07.028
Thank you, Mummy.
And I'm still smiling.

38:07.908 --> 38:09.348
Oh, no, Mummy.
Thank you.

38:09.349 --> 38:11.988
Where's Tom?
In bed.

38:13.108 --> 38:14.547
Does he know?
No.

38:14.548 --> 38:16.748
I got the text, kept him away from
it all.

38:17.868 --> 38:19.908
I can't...

38:20.428 --> 38:23.708
Do you know what happened? Should we
be worried, for other kids?

38:23.709 --> 38:24.907
Don't know yet.

38:24.908 --> 38:26.948
I'll go up and tell him in a minute.

38:28.748 --> 38:30.748
How's the new boss?

38:32.428 --> 38:34.468
Come here.

38:38.468 --> 38:40.468
It's all right.

38:41.588 --> 38:43.067
It's not all right.

38:43.068 --> 38:45.068
Come here.

38:46.908 --> 38:49.828
I saw him lying there. I don't think
I can do this.

38:54.068 --> 38:55.268
You can.

39:03.188 --> 39:05.548
I keep thinking he's going to walk
back in.

39:07.828 --> 39:10.188
Every time my phone goes, I think
it's Danny.

39:12.748 --> 39:15.108
Why didn't you look in on him last
night?

39:15.348 --> 39:16.467
Beth...

39:16.468 --> 39:20.188
You always look in on him when you
come to bed. Why didn't you see
he was gone?

39:23.828 --> 39:25.828
Why didn't you?

39:28.508 --> 39:30.708
Where were you last night?

39:34.908 --> 39:36.948
I told you. I was on a job.

39:52.428 --> 39:54.588
You know Danny wasn't at school
today?

39:55.748 --> 39:57.748
Yeah.

40:00.708 --> 40:02.748
Tom, sweetheart...

40:06.988 --> 40:09.067
Danny died.

40:09.068 --> 40:11.068
I'm so sorry.

40:13.628 --> 40:15.467
How?

40:15.468 --> 40:17.468
I don't know yet.

40:18.188 --> 40:20.708
He was found on the beach early this
morning.

40:24.428 --> 40:26.108
Does his mum and dad know?

40:26.109 --> 40:28.108
Yeah.

40:29.228 --> 40:31.268
So, look, when...

40:31.588 --> 40:33.628
When someone dies unexpectedly...

40:34.908 --> 40:36.948
it leaves a big hole.

40:38.348 --> 40:41.308
And it's all right to be sad or to
have a cry, OK?

40:43.388 --> 40:45.028
OK.

40:45.348 --> 40:47.068
Will you...? I mean...

40:47.708 --> 40:50.828
Will the police want to ask me
questions?

40:51.188 --> 40:53.188
Yeah.

40:54.708 --> 40:56.828
Is there anything you want to tell me
now?

40:57.748 --> 40:59.748
Was Danny all right?

41:00.108 --> 41:01.907
Yeah.

41:01.908 --> 41:03.748
Of course.

41:05.988 --> 41:08.028
I think a hug's a good idea.

41:17.748 --> 41:19.628
You know I love you more than
anything?

41:19.708 --> 41:20.946
More than chocolate?

41:20.947 --> 41:22.548
Even more than chocolate.

41:22.908 --> 41:24.948
I'll be just downstairs.

41:25.348 --> 41:27.668
And don't be embarrassed to have that
cry.

42:31.628 --> 42:32.947
Hello?

42:32.948 --> 42:35.828
Hi, Olly. It's Karen White from the
Daily Herald.

42:35.829 --> 42:37.507
Oh, um, hi.

42:37.508 --> 42:39.826
I saw you broke the story about Danny
Latimer.

42:39.827 --> 42:42.028
I'm down here after a hotel
recommendation.

42:42.548 --> 42:45.586
Oh, right, OK. Where are you at the
moment? The beach.

42:45.587 --> 42:47.706
I see people have started leaving
flowers.

42:47.707 --> 42:51.106
Danny's sister left one of his toys
down there. It must have started it.

42:51.107 --> 42:54.428
Um, OK, so your best option is the
Traders Hotel.

42:55.148 --> 42:58.066
It's opposite our offices on the
high street.

42:58.067 --> 43:00.948
Becca runs it. Tell her you know us,
she'll give you a good rate.

43:00.949 --> 43:02.587
Great. Thanks.

43:02.588 --> 43:05.068
I'll maybe see you around.
Yeah, I hope so, yeah.

43:05.069 --> 43:06.548
I mean, that would...

43:09.108 --> 43:12.788
Who are you putting up at
the Traders? No-one. A girl, woman.

43:12.789 --> 43:14.467
Oh, a woman?

43:14.468 --> 43:17.268
I'm off to the media briefing at the
school. Good luck.

43:17.269 --> 43:18.948
Not that you...
I know.

43:37.828 --> 43:39.427
Different suit?

43:39.428 --> 43:41.428
Press conference in 10 minutes.

43:42.348 --> 43:45.468
Look at this. CCTV from town centre
last night.

43:49.548 --> 43:50.987
Is that Danny?

43:50.988 --> 43:54.788
It matches his clothes, height. It
looks like his skateboard.
He wasn't abducted.

43:54.789 --> 43:56.827
He snuck out.

43:56.828 --> 43:59.708
Why? Where was he going?
Who was he meeting?

43:59.709 --> 44:02.467
And where's his skateboard?
Yeah.

44:02.468 --> 44:07.068
I was checking through the list of
belongings recovered from Danny's
body and at home

44:07.069 --> 44:09.188
and there's no mobile phone.

44:09.348 --> 44:13.228
He definitely had one. He and Tom,
my son, had the same model,
virtually identical.

44:13.229 --> 44:15.268
It isn't there?
No.

44:15.708 --> 44:17.427
Check with the family.

44:17.428 --> 44:19.068
Good.

44:20.988 --> 44:25.188
I'm going to hand over now to our
senior investigating officer
DI Alec Hardy.

44:28.708 --> 44:32.948
What advice do you have for people in
the town, particularly parents?

44:34.428 --> 44:38.468
The crime rate in this area
is one of the lowest in the country.

44:39.708 --> 44:41.708
This is a terrible anomaly.

44:43.708 --> 44:50.068
We are in the early moments of what
might be a complex investigation.

44:54.148 --> 44:58.468
Danny's life touched many people and
we'll be looking at all those
connections.

45:00.788 --> 45:03.468
If you or someone you know
has any information,

45:04.708 --> 45:06.548
has noticed anything unusual,

45:06.549 --> 45:08.588
please come forward now.

45:09.148 --> 45:11.468
Um, I'd urge everyone, don't hide
anything...

45:13.428 --> 45:14.828
because we will find out.

45:14.988 --> 45:19.947
If a member of your family or a
friend or a neighbour

45:19.948 --> 45:23.066
has been behaving differently
in the past days or weeks,

45:23.067 --> 45:25.426
please tell the police immediately.

45:25.427 --> 45:28.668
There will be no hiding place for
Danny's killer.

45:28.948 --> 45:30.988
We will catch whoever did this.
