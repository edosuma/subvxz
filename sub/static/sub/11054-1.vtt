01:31.691 --> 01:32.680
OK.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.403
Honey?

03:37.050 --> 03:41.146
David, could we just
sit in the courtyard for a minute?

03:41.221 --> 03:43.212
Just a minute?

03:48.094 --> 03:49.891
Sure.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.852
Mommy?

05:26.893 --> 05:28.884
What, sweetie?

05:29.529 --> 05:31.724
Where's my room gonna be?

05:33.166 --> 05:35.691
I thought we'd share a room for a while.

05:37.937 --> 05:40.030
Would you like that?

05:40.106 --> 05:43.132
My old room, from when I was a kid.

05:47.880 --> 05:50.872
You need to go back to sleep.
You have a big day tomorrow.

06:48.141 --> 06:50.132
You doing OK, Jules?

06:53.346 --> 06:56.406
We're almost there, sweetie.
Come on.

07:06.826 --> 07:08.817
Mommy?

07:10.430 --> 07:12.421
I don't wanna go out there.

07:17.470 --> 07:20.928
- It's OK, honey. I promise.
- I'm scared.

07:32.084 --> 07:34.075
What if I hid you?

07:34.153 --> 07:36.144
Would that be OK?

07:36.222 --> 07:38.656
Like on my shoulder,
under my coat?

07:41.227 --> 07:43.821
- The whole way?
- Yeah, the whole way.

08:15.361 --> 08:18.990
- What kind of food do they have?
- On the airplane?

08:19.065 --> 08:22.228
In America. Grandma and Grandpa.

08:22.935 --> 08:24.926
The best.

08:25.004 --> 08:28.770
- Do they have toast?
- Of course.

08:51.564 --> 08:54.533
<i>Welcome to Berlin
International Airport.</i>

08:54.600 --> 08:56.966
<i>Do not leave your luggage unattended.</i>

08:57.036 --> 09:01.871
<i>Unattended luggage is subject to
collection and search by airport police.</i>

09:01.941 --> 09:04.307
<i>Thank you for your cooperation.</i>

09:15.988 --> 09:17.250
Julia?

09:18.057 --> 09:19.046
Julia?

09:48.220 --> 09:51.212
Julia, how many times
do I have to tell you

09:51.290 --> 09:53.656
not to wander away from me
in public places?

09:53.726 --> 09:56.354
- How many times?
- I was hungry.

09:56.429 --> 10:01.025
Honey, it doesn't matter.
You scared me to...

10:02.001 --> 10:06.461
- Look, you really worried me.
- Sorry.

10:08.240 --> 10:09.400
OK.

10:10.543 --> 10:12.534
What kind of snack do you want?

10:16.382 --> 10:18.577
You want this one?

10:19.352 --> 10:22.753
- It's so big.
- It's the biggest.

10:22.822 --> 10:25.188
What kind is it, Mom?

10:25.257 --> 10:29.353
It's an E-474. It's brand new.

10:29.428 --> 10:31.988
Did you make it?

10:32.064 --> 10:35.625
See those huge engines?
Mommy helps make 'em work.

10:37.737 --> 10:39.967
Those men could fall.

10:46.012 --> 10:48.913
Don't worry, honey.
They're not gonna fall.

10:48.981 --> 10:51.074
But they could.

10:51.150 --> 10:53.141
<i>Aalto Flight 9583.</i>

10:53.219 --> 10:56.382
<i>Passengers with small children,
please proceed to Gate...</i>

10:56.455 --> 10:59.652
OK, that's us. Ready?

11:04.664 --> 11:07.462
- Can I hold my own ticket?
- Sure.

11:07.533 --> 11:10.593
You carry it
until we get on the plane, OK?

11:41.500 --> 11:44.298
26, and on the right-hand side.

11:47.039 --> 11:49.303
Yeah. There we go. Right here.

12:01.520 --> 12:03.511
<i>Welcome to Aalto Airlines.</i>

12:12.198 --> 12:16.157
- Stop. Wait, stop. No pushing.
- It didn't even hit me.

12:16.235 --> 12:17.862
Stop it.

12:17.937 --> 12:21.930
- Can we have our candy?
- No candy on this flight.

12:22.007 --> 12:23.440
I'm holding onto it.

12:23.509 --> 12:26.410
Here we go.
All right, so we're row 25.

12:26.479 --> 12:28.743
Do you see what's going on
with your kids?

12:28.814 --> 12:31.248
How will we work this out?
Guys, stop.

12:31.317 --> 12:33.911
Dad. Why does she get everything
all the time?

12:33.986 --> 12:37.820
- We like her more.
- We want you to calm down, OK?

12:37.890 --> 12:39.881
Calm down.

12:39.959 --> 12:41.950
Enjoy your flight.

12:45.931 --> 12:49.196
- Hi. Welcome aboard. Right this way.
- Thank you.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.613
Guys.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.788
Excuse me. Ma'am?

13:22.835 --> 13:26.362
I've got two questions for you.
What are the movies?

13:26.438 --> 13:30.966
And how loud do these headphones go?

13:31.877 --> 13:33.868
Never quite loud enough?

13:33.946 --> 13:36.972
I wish you guys
would do that with bricks.

13:37.049 --> 13:39.244
That way it would end faster.

13:39.318 --> 13:43.049
Those empty seats in the back
are starting to look pretty attractive.

13:45.157 --> 13:47.648
Thank you. Guys, stop it.

13:48.861 --> 13:51.261
- Hi, Stephanie.
- Hey, Bill.

13:51.330 --> 13:53.423
Could be some high maintenance
in row 25.

13:53.499 --> 13:54.523
I heard 'em.

13:54.600 --> 13:57.228
I think the people two planes away
heard them.

13:57.303 --> 14:00.238
Tell the new kid
it's OK to laugh about the passengers.

14:00.306 --> 14:02.501
It's OK to hate the passengers.

14:02.575 --> 14:05.476
They've just shut down Frankfurt.

14:05.544 --> 14:08.138
Thank God we aren't going to Frankfurt.

14:08.214 --> 14:10.205
We may not be going anywhere.

14:26.632 --> 14:30.932
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we apologize for the delay this evening.</i>

14:31.003 --> 14:33.096
<i>We should be taking off shortly.</i>

14:42.581 --> 14:45.243
Bob, what was that?

14:45.317 --> 14:47.785
I don't know.
It's nothing to worry about.

14:50.789 --> 14:55.089
They have to nick the ice off or the
air won't pass over the wing properly.

15:17.249 --> 15:20.013
You just sleep, honey.

15:20.085 --> 15:23.020
And when you wake up,
we'll be somewhere else.

15:24.056 --> 15:26.047
We'll be in New York.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.917
Daddy, too?

15:30.362 --> 15:31.522
Yeah.

15:32.865 --> 15:34.856
Daddy, too.

16:25.217 --> 16:27.208
I love this part.

17:09.895 --> 17:12.921
You OK?
Do you want me to get the steward?

17:20.606 --> 17:23.040
How'd you like a whole row to yourself?

17:25.544 --> 17:27.637
Last couple of rows are empty.

17:27.713 --> 17:30.375
We could take a few seats
and we could stretch out.

17:32.084 --> 17:34.075
Would you like that?

18:28.974 --> 18:30.669
Honey, I fell asleep.

18:57.803 --> 19:00.294
Are you watching this movie?

19:01.206 --> 19:02.798
No.

19:02.875 --> 19:04.866
Not too funny.

19:04.943 --> 19:08.811
Course at 36,000ft you can't just
up and walk out of the theater.

19:08.881 --> 19:12.817
- Did you see a little girl go by here?
- No, sure didn't.

19:13.886 --> 19:15.877
My daughter...

19:17.055 --> 19:21.048
- How long have we been flying?
- Three hours. Maybe a little more.

19:57.596 --> 20:00.224
- Can I help you?
- I'm looking for my daughter.

20:00.299 --> 20:03.097
- There's a girl in the lounge.
- Thank you.

20:08.774 --> 20:10.935
No, she's six, my daughter.

20:11.009 --> 20:13.807
You probably saw us.
I was carrying her aboard.

20:15.247 --> 20:17.306
Of course. Yes.

20:17.382 --> 20:20.010
She hasn't been up here. Sorry.

20:29.094 --> 20:31.085
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry.

20:32.764 --> 20:36.029
She has sandy hair in a ponytail.

20:36.101 --> 20:39.798
She's probably carrying a chenille bear
with one arm.

20:42.207 --> 20:45.040
She probably just found
a couple of kids to play with.

21:03.061 --> 21:05.052
Two Bloody Marys.

21:11.336 --> 21:13.736
- Here you go, ma'am.
- Excuse me.

21:15.207 --> 21:16.196
Excuse me.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.903
Would you mind using the other aisle?

21:18.977 --> 21:23.641
- I'm just looking for my daughter.
- Well, she can't have gone too far.

21:23.715 --> 21:25.706
Fine, I'll go around.

21:26.618 --> 21:28.848
- Your juice.
- Thank you.

21:45.170 --> 21:47.161
Pardon me.

22:22.674 --> 22:23.663
Shit.

22:25.577 --> 22:28.705
- Is something wrong?
- I'm looking for my daughter.

22:30.549 --> 22:32.540
Have you seen her walking by or...

22:33.852 --> 22:36.047
I don't think so.
How old is she?

22:36.121 --> 22:41.058
- She's six.
- No, I never saw her.

22:43.862 --> 22:45.830
Can I help you, ma'am?

22:49.301 --> 22:52.065
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm sorry to interrupt.

22:52.137 --> 22:55.903
It seems our aircraft
is big enough to lose a child in.

22:55.974 --> 22:57.965
Her name is Julia Pratt.

22:58.043 --> 23:01.308
<i>She's six years old
and wearing a navy blue jumper.</i>

23:01.380 --> 23:04.440
<i>If she's near you
or playing with one of your kids,</i>

23:04.516 --> 23:06.507
<i>please press the call button.</i>

23:06.585 --> 23:10.316
<i>We've got an anxious mom up here.
Thank you.</i>

23:23.001 --> 23:25.367
All children
should have to wear a cowbell.

23:36.047 --> 23:38.038
Someone must've seen her.

23:39.184 --> 23:41.175
Any takers?

23:41.787 --> 23:45.223
We've got to search the plane.
I don't know how to organize that.

23:45.290 --> 23:47.520
Miss Pratt,
I am sure she's perfectly OK.

23:47.592 --> 23:48.581
No.

23:49.828 --> 23:51.819
No, she's not.

23:51.897 --> 23:56.231
She's been through something.
She's not herself right now.

23:57.502 --> 24:01.598
- Can we get the seat-belt signs on?
- We're getting ahead of ourselves.

24:01.673 --> 24:05.302
There's nine closets on this plane.
There's four up and five down.

24:05.377 --> 24:07.902
And nobody's checked any of them.

24:08.013 --> 24:10.004
There's galleys, crew quarters.

24:10.081 --> 24:13.778
There's the holds.
Kids can find places like that.

24:13.852 --> 24:18.585
I just need the aisles clear
so I can look, OK?

24:20.325 --> 24:22.350
OK.

24:22.427 --> 24:25.191
I'm gonna have to ask you
to go back to your seat.

24:27.399 --> 24:31.028
But I tell you what. I will personally
go and speak to the captain

24:31.102 --> 24:35.300
and see if he can step away
from the flight deck. All right?

24:47.419 --> 24:50.320
Are you in the airline business?

24:51.823 --> 24:54.690
You seem to know aircraft design.

24:54.759 --> 24:57.523
Yeah, I'm a propulsion engineer.
I work for Elgin Air.

24:57.596 --> 25:00.224
I mean, I just left.

25:02.501 --> 25:04.492
Based in Berlin?

25:05.871 --> 25:08.362
Look, I know
you're just trying to keep me calm.

25:08.440 --> 25:10.874
But the problem is not that I'm anxious.

25:10.942 --> 25:15.470
The problem is my daughter is missing
and nobody can tell me where she is.

25:19.417 --> 25:21.408
I'm sorry.

25:25.857 --> 25:28.553
Do you have any kids?

25:28.627 --> 25:32.222
- Do nieces count?
- Yeah, almost.

25:35.500 --> 25:39.732
They hate playing hide and seek
with me because I always find them.

25:40.472 --> 25:42.463
So, fear not.

25:47.412 --> 25:50.404
Did you guys see my little girl?

25:52.484 --> 25:55.510
You're the one
they made the announcement about?

25:55.587 --> 25:58.522
I didn't even know
you had a kid with you. Did you?

25:58.590 --> 26:00.581
Sorry, I didn't.

26:00.659 --> 26:02.752
Maybe you could help me look for her.

26:02.827 --> 26:05.057
- Cool.
- Awesome. I'm so bored.

26:06.498 --> 26:07.897
Sorry, no.

26:07.966 --> 26:10.230
- Why not?
- Dad, she's lost.

26:10.702 --> 26:14.763
How lost can she be?
We're in a tube.

26:15.674 --> 26:17.665
Turn around.

26:19.578 --> 26:22.342
I'm sure the captain
will be here any minute.

26:28.486 --> 26:30.477
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.

26:38.196 --> 26:40.357
Engineer?

26:42.167 --> 26:43.361
Yeah.

26:43.435 --> 26:46.962
You the one who came up
with the five-across seating?

26:54.145 --> 26:56.136
- Miss Pratt.
- What's wrong?

26:56.214 --> 27:00.241
- Who's she talking to?
- We'll get to the bottom of this.

27:00.318 --> 27:05.051
Is she all right? Did something
happen to her? She's hurt.

27:05.123 --> 27:06.647
OK.

27:06.725 --> 27:10.058
Do you know where my daughter is?
What aren't you telling me?

27:10.128 --> 27:12.688
What aren't you telling me?
Say it.

27:16.101 --> 27:21.129
Miss Pratt, I'm sorry
but I don't think that she's here.

27:21.206 --> 27:24.107
- What?
- We don't...

27:24.876 --> 27:29.108
Ma'am, we don't have any record of your
daughter ever having been on board.

27:31.750 --> 27:33.775
What are you talking about?

27:33.852 --> 27:39.154
The departure gate say they never
checked a Julia Pratt onto this plane.

27:42.427 --> 27:44.418
Of course they did.

27:45.397 --> 27:47.627
She was right next to me.

27:47.699 --> 27:50.167
We were the first two passengers
on the plane.

27:50.235 --> 27:52.703
We must have walked right past you.

27:52.771 --> 27:56.502
Ma'am, this is our passenger manifest.
Your daughter isn't on it.

27:57.042 --> 27:59.374
We walked right past you.

28:00.111 --> 28:04.548
Row 26.
I put her in the seat next to me, 26A.

28:04.616 --> 28:09.451
The manifest lists 26A as unoccupied
and I did the headcount myself.

28:09.521 --> 28:14.356
So you missed one. What does that
have to do with finding her now?

28:17.762 --> 28:20.856
- You want to see her boarding pass?
- If you wouldn't mind.

28:20.932 --> 28:23.730
I put it right in my pocket.

28:30.542 --> 28:33.511
I put both boarding passes in my pocket.

28:43.054 --> 28:45.579
Her backpack's missing.

28:48.960 --> 28:52.691
She couldn't have reached up there
by herself. She's not tall enough.

28:53.665 --> 28:56.395
- Somebody has her.
- That's quite an assumption.

28:56.468 --> 28:59.926
How else could her stuff disappear?
Can you think of another way?

29:00.004 --> 29:03.565
- I have to talk to the captain.
- I can't guarantee that he'll see you.

29:03.641 --> 29:06.769
People do things to little girls.
Sick things. You know that.

29:06.845 --> 29:09.143
I need to talk to the captain.

29:13.251 --> 29:16.948
- Get back to your seat.
- Someone has my daughter.

29:19.991 --> 29:22.152
Captain, I need to speak to you.

29:24.829 --> 29:27.696
You're a threat
to the safety of this aircraft.

29:27.766 --> 29:30.792
- I'm not a threat.
- I'm an air marshal. Can I let you go?

29:32.003 --> 29:32.992
Yes.

29:38.109 --> 29:41.078
Gene Carson. Are you hurt?

29:41.746 --> 29:44.579
- I just need to see the captain.
- I understand.

29:44.649 --> 29:46.640
But that's his call, not yours.

29:49.154 --> 29:50.849
All clear, captain.

29:54.993 --> 29:57.223
The departure gate had no record of her?

29:57.295 --> 29:59.286
No, sir. I had them double check.

30:00.598 --> 30:04.227
- And there's no boarding pass.
- There was but it was taken from me.

30:10.742 --> 30:13.336
You were working the entry door,
is that right?

30:13.411 --> 30:16.505
- Yes, captain.
- Did you see the girl?

30:16.581 --> 30:18.572
I don't...

30:22.120 --> 30:24.418
I don't remember either way, sir.

30:24.489 --> 30:27.014
Sir, I did the count myself.
26A was empty.

30:28.860 --> 30:32.591
- Did you tell him about the bear?
- The bear?

30:32.664 --> 30:36.828
It was under her blanket. She wouldn't
have walked away without it.

30:38.369 --> 30:43.204
Have you had anything to drink on this
flight? Anything alcoholic at all?

30:43.274 --> 30:44.263
No.

30:45.410 --> 30:47.742
Are you under any medication?

30:48.847 --> 30:52.715
I have sleeping pills with me just like
every other passenger on board.

30:54.252 --> 30:56.880
And I'm carrying Klonopin.

30:58.022 --> 31:00.422
For anxiety.
I took two this morning.

31:02.293 --> 31:04.523
I see. How long have you been on them?

31:04.596 --> 31:07.463
- I'm not on them.
- How long?

31:08.867 --> 31:10.858
I filled the prescription a week ago.

31:12.904 --> 31:14.895
When my husband died.

31:16.641 --> 31:20.372
My daughter and I are bringing his body
back to Long Island for burial.

31:20.445 --> 31:26.042
There is a casket in the hold, sir,
from Kaiser Wilhelm Hospital.

31:26.117 --> 31:31.020
He fell six days ago
from the roof of our building.

31:40.265 --> 31:43.098
Does anybody on board
remember seeing her?

31:43.167 --> 31:46.864
- Passengers in her row?
- No one has said so, sir.

31:46.938 --> 31:50.738
There are 32 children on the manifest.
They've all been accounted for.

31:55.046 --> 31:58.015
You were seated near her, Mr. Carson.
Isn't that right?

31:58.082 --> 32:01.449
- That's right.
- Did you see her?

32:04.956 --> 32:06.981
No. I didn't.

32:08.459 --> 32:11.587
Think about what you're suggesting,
captain.

32:11.663 --> 32:14.359
That I imagined
bringing her on board

32:14.432 --> 32:16.923
and that I'm now
pretending to look for her.

32:17.001 --> 32:20.732
Does that make any sense? Can you
think of a reason why I would do that?

32:20.805 --> 32:24.639
I'm not drunk, I'm not loaded,
I'm not looking for attention.

32:24.709 --> 32:27.473
There are protocols about these things.

32:27.545 --> 32:32.278
If a pilot has an inaccurate passenger
manifest, he must land the plane.

32:32.350 --> 32:35.877
A teddy bear does not constitute
an inaccurate passenger manifest.

32:35.954 --> 32:40.084
I'm telling you it's inaccurate. That
means you have to search the plane,

32:40.158 --> 32:44.026
just like you would if
it was your own child that was missing.

32:45.797 --> 32:47.788
Julia's only six years old.

32:47.865 --> 32:51.426
She's not in good shape right now.
She's scared of everything.

32:51.502 --> 32:54.938
I had to put her under my coat today
just to get her in the car.

32:57.742 --> 33:02.304
But she did get in that car. She got on
this plane like every other person here.

33:03.247 --> 33:05.112
And I fell asleep.

33:05.183 --> 33:09.882
Which I should never have done.
But she was right next to me.

33:11.756 --> 33:14.589
I was holding her hand when we took off.

33:15.893 --> 33:17.155
Please...

33:19.497 --> 33:21.488
You've got to help her.

33:39.350 --> 33:41.341
Get the lights up.

33:41.419 --> 33:44.877
Get every passenger seated.
No one in the toilets. No exception.

33:44.989 --> 33:47.150
Look for her backpack,
her boarding pass.

33:47.225 --> 33:49.216
Check every closet, every bin.

33:50.261 --> 33:52.422
Are there any more questions?

33:52.497 --> 33:54.488
Thank you.

34:04.075 --> 34:07.806
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we apologize for the inconvenience</i>

34:07.879 --> 34:13.010
<i>but the captain requests that
all passengers return to their seats.</i>

34:13.083 --> 34:15.552
We'll turn off
the seat-belt sign in a minute.

34:15.620 --> 34:19.522
Can you fasten that seat belt,
please, ma'am? Thank you.

34:23.061 --> 34:25.052
I don't see what all the fuss is about.

34:26.030 --> 34:28.726
It's not like she lost her Palm Pilot.

34:43.281 --> 34:46.842
A six-year-old girl
climbing into avionics?

34:49.487 --> 34:51.478
This is really silly.

34:52.556 --> 34:55.788
- This is procedure.
- Captain.

34:55.860 --> 34:57.225
Thanks.

35:11.209 --> 35:13.200
Anybody in here?

35:14.679 --> 35:16.670
Hello?

35:40.738 --> 35:42.729
Miss?

35:43.908 --> 35:45.899
Miss. I need to use the rest room.

35:45.977 --> 35:49.276
As soon as the captairs
turned off the seat-belt sign, sir.

35:49.347 --> 35:51.338
I don't need an escort.

35:51.415 --> 35:53.883
I'm responsible for any threat

35:53.951 --> 35:57.148
- to the safety of this flight.
- This is absurd.

35:57.221 --> 36:00.486
Women with imaginary children qualify.

36:02.226 --> 36:04.387
Sir, you'll have to return to your seat.

36:04.462 --> 36:07.192
- My back gets stiff...
- I'm sorry.

36:07.265 --> 36:09.859
All passengers
must remain in their seats.

36:09.934 --> 36:11.925
I know.

36:12.503 --> 36:15.028
Running out of magazines up here.

36:17.008 --> 36:21.069
Tell me something.
What are you gonna do when we find her?

36:21.145 --> 36:23.136
How are you gonna explain yourself?

36:23.214 --> 36:27.810
It's not so bad if she's lost.
Because then you just look lazy.

36:30.321 --> 36:34.257
But if somebody took her,
if a crime was committed on this flight,

36:34.325 --> 36:38.056
and the law enforcement official
on board didn't do anything about it,

36:38.129 --> 36:40.120
how's that gonna look?

36:40.198 --> 36:42.189
You made your point.

37:07.959 --> 37:09.859
- Katerina.
- What?

37:09.927 --> 37:12.418
- Have a look.
- Why? Did you see something?

37:12.496 --> 37:16.728
No. It's just that I'm dying
to watch you crawl through that hatch.

37:29.180 --> 37:31.171
What's the problem?

37:33.217 --> 37:35.549
May I help you?

37:35.620 --> 37:37.747
Do I know you from somewhere?

37:37.822 --> 37:41.189
You've walked past me five times
since we took off.

37:41.259 --> 37:43.250
Does that count?

37:43.327 --> 37:46.922
- Are you from Berlin?
- Am I being interrogated now?

37:46.998 --> 37:51.992
- I asked you if you're from Berlin.
- No. I am not.

37:53.070 --> 37:55.061
Let's go.

37:55.906 --> 37:57.897
What was that all about?

38:07.952 --> 38:11.285
Think about what you're saying no to.
It would be epic.

38:11.355 --> 38:13.346
You're terrible.

38:17.328 --> 38:20.092
My daughter.
You were looking for my daughter.

38:21.666 --> 38:24.226
I need to speak to the captain again.

38:25.236 --> 38:28.171
Can you get him
on the phone for me, please?

38:29.006 --> 38:30.997
OK. Can we look in the holds now?

38:32.510 --> 38:36.378
There is no way a child could have
gained access to any of the holds.

38:36.447 --> 38:39.678
There's access to the forward holds
from galley number two.

38:39.750 --> 38:43.379
- The call buttors too high for...
- So was the overhead bin.

38:43.454 --> 38:46.548
- She's with an adult. I told you...
- What adult?

38:46.624 --> 38:51.527
- Every passenger is in his seat.
- The passenger manifest is inaccurate.

38:51.595 --> 38:54.393
You've got to search the holds now.

38:54.465 --> 38:57.957
I'm sorry, Miss Pratt.
I'm afraid I can't allow that.

38:59.403 --> 39:02.463
- Excuse me.
- Godammit, are you listening?

39:05.509 --> 39:07.739
Wait.

39:07.812 --> 39:10.610
- I don't think it's such a bad idea.
- What?

39:10.681 --> 39:13.309
It might be good
to have her below deck for a while.

39:13.384 --> 39:18.048
She is making the passengers anxious.
Obviously I would go down with her.

39:18.122 --> 39:22.889
Mr. Carson, I am responsible for the
safety of every passenger on this plane.

39:22.960 --> 39:26.987
Even the delusional ones and I will not
have a passenger out of her seat

39:27.064 --> 39:30.090
bouncing around
with the luggage bins in the holds.

39:30.167 --> 39:34.900
Any turbulence and you could be injured.
And so could you, Mr. Carson.

39:37.108 --> 39:42.910
Now, we're going to continue to search
this aircraft from the waist upwards.

39:42.980 --> 39:48.475
If we don't find anybody, I will send
two members of my crew into the holds.

39:48.552 --> 39:51.316
I just saw two members of your crew

39:51.389 --> 39:54.825
and they did everything
except look for my daughter.

39:54.892 --> 39:58.919
Miss Pratt,
there are 425 passengers on this flight

39:58.996 --> 40:01.692
who are not receiving any attention
at the moment

40:01.766 --> 40:05.395
because every one of my flight
attendants are looking for a child

40:05.469 --> 40:08.165
that none of them believe
was ever on board.

40:08.239 --> 40:11.606
If you think we could be doing more
to meet your needs,

40:11.675 --> 40:15.702
then I suggest you take it up
with customer service after we land.

40:15.780 --> 40:18.408
Captain,
can I speak to you for a moment?

40:20.684 --> 40:23.380
Mr. Carson,
this woman is in your charge.

40:24.388 --> 40:27.289
I want her to remain
in the passenger cabin.

40:27.358 --> 40:29.553
Is that understood?

40:29.627 --> 40:31.618
Understood.

40:31.762 --> 40:33.753
Do excuse me.

40:42.606 --> 40:43.655
I know where I've seen him before.

40:43.690 --> 40:44.704
I know where I've seen him before.

40:49.847 --> 40:51.838
I know where I've seen you before.

40:55.986 --> 40:58.250
- What?
- Where's my daughter?

40:58.322 --> 41:01.018
You were looking
through her window last night.

41:01.091 --> 41:04.390
I saw you staring
into my daughter's room. Both of them.

41:04.462 --> 41:06.589
- You are a lunatic.
- Where's Julia?

41:06.664 --> 41:10.327
Hold it. Back up.
Have you seen these men before?

41:10.401 --> 41:12.926
- Yes.
- No. She has not.

41:13.003 --> 41:16.700
I saw them last night
staring into my daughter's room.

41:19.009 --> 41:21.000
Is this correct, sir?

41:21.078 --> 41:23.808
- I've never seen this woman before.
- Neither have I.

41:23.881 --> 41:26.179
What do you expect them to say,
"You got me"?

41:26.250 --> 41:30.983
- Shouldrt we move this to a galley?
- Why? I didn't do anything.

41:31.655 --> 41:33.885
I've never even seen this woman before.

41:33.958 --> 41:37.291
- Where'd you take my little girl?
- Arert you listening?

41:37.361 --> 41:39.352
I have never seen her.

41:47.071 --> 41:49.062
I don't trust 'em.

41:50.841 --> 41:53.401
Not that it's any of your concern,

41:53.477 --> 41:57.038
but I was at the Hilton last night
on business.

41:57.681 --> 42:01.811
We both were.
And neither of us left the hotel.

42:03.787 --> 42:05.778
Would you like to see our bill?

42:07.324 --> 42:09.315
It's a bit unorthodox but...

42:11.028 --> 42:13.360
...if you wouldn't mind.

42:25.409 --> 42:29.743
When I travel with my children,
I have an eye on them at all times.

42:30.781 --> 42:33.841
I don't lose them
and blame somebody else.

42:52.736 --> 42:56.172
- Satisfied?
- A bill doesn't prove anything.

42:57.841 --> 42:58.967
Satisfied?

42:59.043 --> 43:01.944
Are you gonna let him
talk to you like that?

43:07.585 --> 43:09.712
- Let's go.
- Where's my daughter?

43:09.787 --> 43:13.086
I spent the night watching a movie,
you crazy...

43:13.457 --> 43:16.255
- Come here.
- Where's my daughter?

43:16.327 --> 43:18.852
Get a handle on this lady, will ya?

43:19.897 --> 43:21.990
It's OK. I'm OK.

43:22.066 --> 43:24.057
Is that the lady with the kid?

43:24.969 --> 43:29.599
Anyone else have any questions for me?

43:34.111 --> 43:37.046
Then you'll have to find
a few other Arabs to harass.

43:37.114 --> 43:40.083
- Sonofabitch.
- We're gonna take our seats now.

43:40.150 --> 43:43.085
All of us. Right?

43:47.157 --> 43:51.787
- I can cuff you, understand that?
- Why would you want to cuff me?

43:51.862 --> 43:55.263
Sorry. Got a seventy-year-old
who couldn't hold his pee any longer.

43:55.399 --> 43:58.334
Mine's six, almost wet himself.

43:58.402 --> 44:01.599
OK. You think those men
were surveilling you last night

44:01.672 --> 44:04.004
for the purposes
of kidnapping your daughter

44:04.074 --> 44:06.770
- and stashing her until we land?
- Yes.

44:06.844 --> 44:09.108
Mind if I ask you
an obvious question?

44:09.179 --> 44:12.273
If they knew where you lived,
why not take her from there?

44:12.349 --> 44:15.147
Why take her on an airplane
with no means of escape?

44:15.219 --> 44:18.188
- I don't know.
- And let's not forget,

44:18.255 --> 44:22.521
her name isn't on the manifest.
How could two passengers pull that off?

44:22.593 --> 44:25.528
They'd have to have
somebody from the crew involved.

44:25.596 --> 44:26.585
Jesus.

44:28.332 --> 44:30.459
Think about what you're asking me to do.

44:30.534 --> 44:35.494
Approach two Arabs on an airplane
and accuse them of criminal conspiracy.

44:35.572 --> 44:38.541
I don't give a shit
about being politically incorrect.

44:38.609 --> 44:42.875
Fine, let's arrest them, just as soon
as you answer one more question.

44:42.946 --> 44:46.143
Why would anyone
want to take your daughter?

44:46.216 --> 44:50.152
What makes her so special?
What makes you so special?

44:54.224 --> 44:59.719
I know the plane.
That's what this is all about.

44:59.797 --> 45:03.790
- Why they picked me.
- They picked you? For what?

45:03.867 --> 45:08.736
I think they're hijacking the plane.
I think my daughter's a hostage.

45:08.806 --> 45:12.367
Your husband's death is starting
to make a lot more sense to me.

45:12.443 --> 45:15.469
A couple more hours
and even I'm ready to jump.

45:20.217 --> 45:22.208
He fell.

45:22.286 --> 45:24.914
- David fell.
- Sure he did.

45:25.823 --> 45:30.419
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the captairs
turned off the seat-belt sign.</i>

45:30.494 --> 45:33.122
<i>- You are now free to...
- What's he doing?</i>

45:35.733 --> 45:37.724
What's he doing?

45:54.384 --> 45:55.874
Excuse me.

45:58.956 --> 46:01.720
What are you doing?
Are we done looking?

46:01.792 --> 46:04.317
- Just come with me.
- I'm not going anywhere.

46:04.394 --> 46:06.487
We're not going to discuss this here.

46:06.563 --> 46:08.588
Where's my daughter?
Where is she?

46:08.665 --> 46:11.190
She's dead, godammit.

46:14.471 --> 46:16.496
You found her.

46:19.109 --> 46:21.839
No, I didn't find her, Miss Pratt.

46:34.024 --> 46:37.084
This is from Kaiser Wilhelm Hospital.

46:38.595 --> 46:42.053
That's where your husband
was pronounced dead. Is that correct?

46:44.234 --> 46:45.861
Yes.

46:46.904 --> 46:49.134
Your daughter was also taken there.

46:49.807 --> 46:53.709
No. She wasrt there when it happened.
She was with the nanny.

46:53.777 --> 46:58.043
Miss Pratt, according to the director
at the morgue there

46:58.115 --> 47:01.915
your daughter Julia
died of internal injuries

47:01.985 --> 47:04.545
at 2.36pm.

47:05.856 --> 47:07.847
He took her with him off the roof.

47:08.992 --> 47:10.983
Didrt he?

47:11.895 --> 47:14.159
No. Julia wasrt even there.

47:15.098 --> 47:17.896
She was at the park.

47:18.936 --> 47:20.927
She was at the park.

47:21.004 --> 47:22.995
She wasrt even there.

47:24.274 --> 47:26.265
She wasrt even there.

47:34.017 --> 47:36.281
You're crazy. You're all crazy.

47:37.754 --> 47:42.714
- She was never on board.
- No. I carried her on board.

47:42.793 --> 47:47.230
Miss Pratt,
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

47:47.297 --> 47:49.288
She must be so scared.

47:49.366 --> 47:55.168
But my main responsibility
is the safety of these passengers

47:55.239 --> 48:00.302
and I can't allow anyone, no matter
how tragic their circumstances,

48:00.377 --> 48:04.336
- to jeopardize that.
- She doesn't know where she is.

48:05.883 --> 48:09.683
Our air marshal is going
to escort you back to your seat.

48:09.753 --> 48:11.914
Mr. Carson,

48:12.823 --> 48:14.916
would you take her back to her seat now?

48:27.104 --> 48:28.571
What's she doing?

48:28.639 --> 48:30.630
Stop her.

48:33.710 --> 48:35.701
Grab her.

49:01.338 --> 49:03.329
How are you feeling?

49:04.942 --> 49:06.933
Are you in pain?

49:08.779 --> 49:10.940
We can get you some aspirin if you want.

49:11.015 --> 49:14.849
Kids, turn around. Turn around.

49:15.886 --> 49:17.877
Turn around.

49:25.963 --> 49:29.763
The captain thought
you might want to talk with me.

49:31.368 --> 49:33.359
I'm a therapist.

49:34.538 --> 49:36.529
My seat's just a few rows up.

49:37.841 --> 49:39.832
And I asked if I might be able to help.

49:41.779 --> 49:43.906
I don't know you.

49:43.981 --> 49:47.849
So many of my patients
come to me after a loss.

49:49.953 --> 49:51.944
To grieve.

49:55.192 --> 49:58.855
Sometimes it's just stopping.

50:00.698 --> 50:02.689
Allowing the pain to come.

50:07.338 --> 50:09.465
Your husband, David...

50:11.942 --> 50:14.069
...can you tell me about him?

50:16.013 --> 50:18.004
I don't know you.

50:21.151 --> 50:23.142
Was he very unappy?

50:30.928 --> 50:31.917
Yes.

50:33.931 --> 50:36.525
He was unappy.

50:37.935 --> 50:39.926
I didn't know.

50:42.172 --> 50:44.504
He didn't talk about it like that.

50:46.310 --> 50:48.301
I understand.

50:54.985 --> 50:59.718
Last night
I walked through the city

51:02.092 --> 51:04.083
and he was with me.

51:05.396 --> 51:09.560
- He was there.
- Was Julia there, too?

51:09.633 --> 51:10.622
No.

51:11.935 --> 51:14.563
She was waiting for me at home.

51:15.706 --> 51:18.675
She was happy to see you?

51:21.512 --> 51:23.503
She said she couldn't sleep.

51:25.883 --> 51:28.545
So I got into bed with her.

51:30.554 --> 51:32.545
And lay there

51:34.358 --> 51:36.883
until she closed her eyes.

51:41.031 --> 51:45.730
When something's too
overwhelming, too painful,

51:47.638 --> 51:49.765
we deny it.

51:49.840 --> 51:51.831
We choose to believe something else.

51:53.377 --> 51:56.869
So you can walk with David and

51:58.081 --> 52:00.242
get on a plane with Julia.

52:02.486 --> 52:04.477
It feels better than the truth.

52:08.258 --> 52:10.249
So much better.

52:13.063 --> 52:15.054
Yes, of course.

52:19.503 --> 52:22.802
But it's impossible to move on
if we haven't accepted,

52:24.274 --> 52:26.674
if we haven't grieved.

52:31.982 --> 52:34.143
Sometimes it helps to think of an image.

52:35.986 --> 52:40.946
You could imagine your husband
and daughter on an island.

52:41.024 --> 52:43.117
A beautiful place.

52:44.261 --> 52:49.893
They'll always be there. And you can
swim to them any time you need to.

53:16.193 --> 53:18.184
Do you understand?

53:27.304 --> 53:29.295
Am I allowed to go to the rest room?

53:35.712 --> 53:38.044
I just need to be alone.

53:39.716 --> 53:41.707
I don't know where else to go.

53:45.689 --> 53:47.680
This is a very good idea.

53:50.894 --> 53:52.885
She needs a moment on her own.

53:56.800 --> 53:58.927
Is she any kind of threat to herself?

53:59.002 --> 54:01.493
No. Of course not.

54:01.572 --> 54:05.303
- Should we take her belt and shoelaces?
- No, she's going to be fine.

54:06.109 --> 54:08.100
She's going to be fine.

54:08.545 --> 54:10.536
Arert you?

54:12.149 --> 54:14.140
You're going to be fine.

54:23.994 --> 54:25.985
Excuse me.

54:38.342 --> 54:40.902
- Pardon me.
- Excuse me.

54:40.978 --> 54:42.969
Sure.

54:53.624 --> 54:54.613
I'll be waiting right here.

55:39.903 --> 55:41.894
I'll be right out.

56:08.098 --> 56:11.363
All right, place the mask
over your nose and mouth.

56:11.768 --> 56:13.895
Breathe normally.

56:13.970 --> 56:15.528
They're tangled up.

56:15.605 --> 56:18.301
Sir, please take your seat.

56:20.711 --> 56:24.477
- I don't wanna die.
- Attention. There is no need to panic.

56:24.548 --> 56:28.541
Place the mask over your nose and mouth
and use the straps to tighten it.

56:49.272 --> 56:51.069
Stay calm.

56:56.146 --> 56:58.410
No way.

57:02.018 --> 57:05.146
OK. Stay back in your seat.

57:14.631 --> 57:16.997
Stay in your seat, ma'am.
Thank you.

57:22.906 --> 57:24.897
What did you do to the lights?

57:37.888 --> 57:39.879
Get your hands off me.

57:42.159 --> 57:44.559
Where is she?

57:44.628 --> 57:48.155
You don't need a mask.
We haven't lost pressure. Where is she?

58:01.678 --> 58:02.667
Julia?

58:25.569 --> 58:27.696
Julia? Are you in there?

59:37.741 --> 59:39.732
I'm right here, baby. Hold on.

59:39.809 --> 59:43.245
Just wait. Mommy's here, baby.

59:53.857 --> 59:54.846
No...

59:58.929 --> 01:00:00.362
David...

01:00:04.467 --> 01:00:05.456
Honey...

01:00:09.139 --> 01:00:12.233
I'm so scared, honey.

01:00:14.744 --> 01:00:18.145
I can't find her.
I can't find our baby.

01:00:18.214 --> 01:00:20.341
I don't know where she is.

01:00:20.417 --> 01:00:23.978
But no one will help me.

01:00:24.054 --> 01:00:26.045
No one can help me.

01:00:27.257 --> 01:00:30.693
They didn't even see her.

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:32.751
Turn around.

01:00:36.833 --> 01:00:38.824
Don't...

01:00:41.771 --> 01:00:43.762
I'm not done looking yet.

01:00:44.407 --> 01:00:46.637
Yeah, you are. Let's go.

01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:48.905
What's he doing?
There's two hours left.

01:00:48.979 --> 01:00:50.606
We're descending.

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:55.049
That's what pilots do when there's
an out-of-control passenger on board.

01:00:55.118 --> 01:00:59.054
Fine. The sooner we land,
the sooner we can clear the airplane

01:00:59.122 --> 01:01:00.851
and I can keep searching.

01:01:00.924 --> 01:01:05.054
- I haven't checked in the attics yet.
- They've already been searched.

01:01:05.128 --> 01:01:07.119
I haven't searched them.

01:01:09.366 --> 01:01:14.133
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we have begun to descend now.</i>

01:01:14.204 --> 01:01:16.866
<i>We are going to be making
an unscheduled stop...</i>

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:19.665
<i>We'd like to apologize for any delay.</i>

01:01:19.743 --> 01:01:23.770
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

01:01:24.481 --> 01:01:26.472
Here she comes.

01:01:31.254 --> 01:01:34.155
How come
there's only one coffin down there?

01:01:34.224 --> 01:01:38.888
If my daughter had died with my husband,
I'd be flying two coffins home.

01:01:38.962 --> 01:01:41.055
Wouldrt I?

01:01:41.131 --> 01:01:43.827
You know what?
I don't know... and I don't care.

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:46.630
You just scared the shit
out of 400 passengers

01:01:46.703 --> 01:01:49.501
who didn't plan
to spend the night in Newfoundland.

01:01:49.572 --> 01:01:53.440
My daughter's alive. You know she's
alive. You know she's on this plane.

01:01:54.677 --> 01:01:56.668
Why didn't anybody see her?

01:01:59.616 --> 01:02:02.585
Please. There's not that many places
left to search.

01:02:02.652 --> 01:02:05.348
I just need
the plane deboarded when we land.

01:02:06.689 --> 01:02:09.055
You're gonna be arrested when we land.

01:02:20.103 --> 01:02:22.094
Gonna hold onto her this time?

01:02:33.850 --> 01:02:35.841
About time.

01:03:28.938 --> 01:03:31.372
If you let them arrest me,

01:03:31.441 --> 01:03:33.432
she's gone for ever.

01:03:40.416 --> 01:03:42.907
There'll be no one to save her.

01:03:44.554 --> 01:03:46.215
Please...

01:03:47.157 --> 01:03:49.148
I'm begging you.

01:04:09.512 --> 01:04:11.173
Ma'am.

01:04:15.685 --> 01:04:16.743
Sir.

01:04:20.957 --> 01:04:23.790
I need to talk to the captain.
Can you sit here?

01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:27.956
- We're descending. All passengers...
- I'm sorry. It's a security matter.

01:04:28.031 --> 01:04:30.022
She won't be any trouble.

01:05:28.625 --> 01:05:30.616
Are you hurt?

01:05:32.328 --> 01:05:33.317
No.

01:05:35.265 --> 01:05:37.256
Did you eat anything?

01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:43.061
What part of the plane did you search?

01:05:43.139 --> 01:05:44.902
I'm sorry?

01:05:44.974 --> 01:05:47.306
When we had the crew search
for my daughter?

01:05:48.578 --> 01:05:50.569
Where were you?

01:05:52.682 --> 01:05:54.673
I'm very sorry for your loss, ma'am.

01:07:31.447 --> 01:07:34.177
- What does she want?
- $50 million.

01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:36.241
Transferred into that account.

01:07:38.354 --> 01:07:40.345
Or they blow up the plane.

01:07:42.191 --> 01:07:43.180
They?

01:07:43.259 --> 01:07:46.228
She has an accomplice on board.
She won't say who it is.

01:07:46.295 --> 01:07:49.162
But...
that's who's holding the detonator.

01:07:49.232 --> 01:07:53.066
The plane's to be deboarded on the
tarmac, passengers first, then crew.

01:07:53.136 --> 01:07:56.037
And they want a G3.
Fuelled and waiting.

01:07:56.105 --> 01:07:58.869
So all that searching
for the girl was just a...

01:07:58.941 --> 01:08:03.139
She's disturbed. She used her husband's
coffin to get explosives on board.

01:08:03.212 --> 01:08:05.942
And as for the little girl,
I don't know.

01:08:07.550 --> 01:08:10.212
Maybe she killed them both.

01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:16.288
- I want to speak to her.
- She doesn't want that.

01:08:16.359 --> 01:08:18.554
No approaches
by any member of the crew.

01:08:19.729 --> 01:08:21.594
Now, listen.

01:08:21.663 --> 01:08:22.995
Listen.

01:08:25.368 --> 01:08:28.564
I don't get the feeling
she wants to hurt anyone.

01:08:30.072 --> 01:08:34.270
I've never heard of a hijacker
letting passengers deboard before.

01:08:34.343 --> 01:08:38.939
My recommendation is you ask
the airline to wire the money,

01:08:39.015 --> 01:08:41.779
notify me when the transfer's been made.

01:08:43.486 --> 01:08:44.475
OK?

01:08:45.688 --> 01:08:48.156
Let's keep her thinking
she's in control.

01:08:48.224 --> 01:08:51.455
We'll land, get everyone deboarded,

01:08:52.929 --> 01:08:55.488
then we take her down.

01:09:04.907 --> 01:09:06.499
Mr. Carson?

01:09:08.778 --> 01:09:11.406
- What are you doing?
- I am not sitting back there.

01:09:11.481 --> 01:09:15.008
- Gene, she knows.
- What does she know?

01:09:15.084 --> 01:09:19.214
She knows the kid's in avionics,
she knows that I'm a part of this.

01:09:19.287 --> 01:09:21.984
- Did she say anything about avionics?
- No.

01:09:22.058 --> 01:09:24.549
- Did you?
- No.

01:09:24.627 --> 01:09:29.154
Then why are you panicking? Everything's
working out how we wanted it to.

01:09:29.232 --> 01:09:32.827
She has half the plane believing
we have Arab terrorists on board.

01:09:32.902 --> 01:09:36.269
- It's priceless.
- She's putting things together, Gene.

01:09:36.339 --> 01:09:40.139
What difference does it make? She'll
be dead ten minutes after we land.

01:09:40.209 --> 01:09:43.372
They'll find her
with a bullet hole through her head.

01:09:43.446 --> 01:09:46.142
And a detonator in her hand.

01:09:46.215 --> 01:09:50.276
Hasrt this all been explained to you
a thousand times?

01:09:50.353 --> 01:09:54.813
The only piece of evidence that matters
is about this high.

01:09:54.891 --> 01:09:58.622
Her name is Julia
and she is gonna get vaporized.

01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:04.593
Now it is all working.
Get it together.

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:13.634
OK, look.
If something goes wrong when we land...

01:10:13.709 --> 01:10:17.577
Mr. Carson?
The captain would like you to call him.

01:10:17.647 --> 01:10:19.638
Thank you.

01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:26.411
Yes, captain.

01:10:26.489 --> 01:10:29.981
<i>The money's been wired.
I have confirmation. Do you have a pen?</i>

01:10:30.059 --> 01:10:32.050
I do.

01:10:35.231 --> 01:10:36.323
Go ahead.

01:10:36.399 --> 01:10:40.529
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the captain
has turned on the seat-belt sign</i>

01:10:40.603 --> 01:10:42.594
<i>as we prepare for our final descent.</i>

01:10:42.672 --> 01:10:45.641
<i>Please return your seat
to its upright position.</i>

01:10:45.708 --> 01:10:47.869
Thank you. I can handle it from here.

01:10:55.351 --> 01:10:57.285
I don't understand.

01:10:57.353 --> 01:10:59.651
Cuffs are for people who pose a threat.

01:10:59.722 --> 01:11:00.916
Right?

01:11:04.026 --> 01:11:08.656
We're putting down in Goose Bay,
Newfoundland. The F.B.I.'s en route.

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:14.327
I've notified them that
we have a missing person situation.

01:11:15.705 --> 01:11:19.038
They'll clear the plane
and every passenger on board

01:11:19.108 --> 01:11:21.474
will be detained and questioned.

01:11:21.544 --> 01:11:25.913
Two agents will come on board
and help us look for her.

01:11:25.982 --> 01:11:28.450
What about the crew?

01:11:28.517 --> 01:11:30.815
Will they be detained and questioned?

01:11:33.055 --> 01:11:36.218
You've no idea how happy I'm gonna be
to hand this case over.

01:11:37.693 --> 01:11:39.684
Thank you.

01:11:55.911 --> 01:11:57.902
Where the hell are we?

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:05.912
Sit back.

01:12:59.942 --> 01:13:04.845
<i>All units, the suspect will be escorted
off the plane by a flight marshal.</i>

01:13:04.914 --> 01:13:08.042
<i>Confirm. Victor One
standing by to provide transport.</i>

01:13:12.054 --> 01:13:15.581
Just keep quiet.
You don't want to antagonize anybody.

01:13:15.658 --> 01:13:18.559
These people already expect
you to be arrested by now.

01:13:26.836 --> 01:13:28.827
Touch me again, you're dead.

01:13:32.208 --> 01:13:33.197
Touch.

01:13:34.810 --> 01:13:37.142
Go. Move.

01:13:40.082 --> 01:13:42.073
Shut up.

01:14:00.436 --> 01:14:01.425
OK.

01:14:02.471 --> 01:14:04.462
The crew's gonna deboard now.

01:14:04.607 --> 01:14:08.304
Another couple of minutes,
the plane will be all yours.

01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:12.679
- Where are you going?
- I need to talk to him.

01:14:12.748 --> 01:14:15.080
Make sure
nothing gets taken off the plane.

01:14:15.151 --> 01:14:19.315
No food can'ts, no trash cans.
It's important the plane stays sealed.

01:14:19.388 --> 01:14:22.380
Well, I don't really have the option
to say no.

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:26.151
Do I?

01:14:36.605 --> 01:14:38.596
OK, let's sit down.

01:14:39.975 --> 01:14:41.465
Captain.

01:14:49.018 --> 01:14:51.009
All set for deboarding?

01:14:51.887 --> 01:14:56.824
Captain, look. I know I broke the law
and disrupted your flight.

01:14:56.892 --> 01:14:59.292
But in a few minutes,
we'll find my daughter...

01:14:59.361 --> 01:15:04.958
- The crew can deboard now.
- And you're gonna owe her an apology.

01:15:06.535 --> 01:15:07.729
Enough.

01:15:07.803 --> 01:15:11.705
Miss Pratt, your money has been wired
just as you asked.

01:15:12.308 --> 01:15:15.505
A G3 is waiting, just as you asked.

01:15:16.512 --> 01:15:19.970
Perhaps we can do without the pretense
of the missing child now.

01:15:20.049 --> 01:15:21.277
What?

01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:24.148
- Wait here. I'll get them.
- Get who?

01:15:24.854 --> 01:15:27.550
The agents. Wait here.

01:15:51.847 --> 01:15:54.315
<i>Subject is zero 50 meters.</i>

01:16:05.394 --> 01:16:07.294
Carson.

01:16:13.235 --> 01:16:16.227
You get off the plane
when I say you get off the plane.

01:16:46.902 --> 01:16:49.029
You want to play?
Let's play.

01:16:49.104 --> 01:16:51.095
I want my daughter.

01:16:51.173 --> 01:16:53.733
Deboard the crew
and we'll talk about it.

01:16:54.810 --> 01:16:59.270
Or you can go back there
and tell them I'm the hijacker.

01:16:59.348 --> 01:17:01.373
And maybe they'll believe you.

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:04.214
Maybe I'll tell them
what you've got in your pocket.

01:17:04.286 --> 01:17:07.881
Go ahead. The first one to go
will be your daughter.

01:17:46.095 --> 01:17:48.859
- Will that be all?
- No.

01:17:49.498 --> 01:17:51.489
Give him your gun.

01:18:06.682 --> 01:18:10.015
- God speed, Mr. Carson.
- Thank you, captain.

01:18:20.863 --> 01:18:22.854
I think you and I need to talk.

01:18:22.931 --> 01:18:24.558
Me, too.

01:18:47.923 --> 01:18:50.118
Where is she?

01:18:50.192 --> 01:18:52.854
Where'd you put her?

01:18:59.802 --> 01:19:02.737
She's in avionics, isn't she?
Isn't she?

01:19:14.450 --> 01:19:16.441
Stay here.

01:19:48.016 --> 01:19:51.713
Listen, it's over.

01:19:53.722 --> 01:19:56.156
Nobody is coming to help you.

01:19:56.225 --> 01:19:59.717
You're the crazy lady.
So why don't you just come out of there?

01:20:00.629 --> 01:20:02.620
Nobody has to die.

01:20:03.732 --> 01:20:06.223
My husband
didn't jump off that building.

01:20:06.301 --> 01:20:08.292
He didn't fall off it either.

01:20:09.771 --> 01:20:12.137
You're taking things too personally.

01:20:13.408 --> 01:20:16.673
We needed a coffin
because they aren't X-rayed.

01:20:17.079 --> 01:20:19.843
We needed a credible hijacker
who knew the plane.

01:20:21.283 --> 01:20:23.274
Those are the breaks.

01:22:26.708 --> 01:22:29.006
You really wanna kill a little girl?

01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:34.112
He wouldn't mind. I know that.

01:22:35.050 --> 01:22:38.281
The harder this gets,
the more he seems to enjoy himself.

01:22:38.353 --> 01:22:40.651
But what about you?

01:22:44.559 --> 01:22:47.119
What about you?

01:22:47.195 --> 01:22:49.186
You wanna kill my little girl?

01:23:47.356 --> 01:23:49.119
<i>Is that our suspect?</i>

01:23:49.191 --> 01:23:51.659
<i>Negative on that.
That is not our suspect.</i>

01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:19.209
Julia...

01:24:34.970 --> 01:24:37.165
Honey, can you hear me?

01:24:37.239 --> 01:24:39.230
God, what did they do to you?

01:25:18.313 --> 01:25:21.908
OK.
Your husband didn't fall off the roof.

01:25:22.617 --> 01:25:24.983
He flew off.

01:25:25.053 --> 01:25:27.044
Come on. Come on out.

01:25:29.357 --> 01:25:32.918
Nobody's coming for you.
You know why?

01:25:32.994 --> 01:25:34.985
Because nobody cares.

01:25:35.664 --> 01:25:39.532
People will think what I tell them
to think. That's how authority works.

01:25:40.969 --> 01:25:43.665
We picked her up,
shoved her into a food bin

01:25:43.738 --> 01:25:45.729
and nobody even looked up.

01:25:45.807 --> 01:25:49.470
You understand what I'm saying?
Nobody cares about Julia.

01:25:51.513 --> 01:25:55.176
All right, it's over.
Let's finish it. All right.

01:26:07.095 --> 01:26:09.086
We'll be safe back here, honey.

01:26:23.912 --> 01:26:27.507
What are you gonna do?
You gonna blow us up?

01:26:27.582 --> 01:26:29.345
No. Just you.

01:26:48.236 --> 01:26:50.329
Good Lord, she did it.

01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:02.678
Dispatch, this is F.B.I. Ground One.
All units back to the outer markers.

01:27:05.921 --> 01:27:08.981
<i>Evac Transport Three
switching to secure three.</i>

01:27:24.906 --> 01:27:28.273
- My God, she's...
- What is she holding?

01:27:30.512 --> 01:27:33.072
She's holding her daughter.

01:27:44.926 --> 01:27:46.951
Her daughter.

01:27:50.031 --> 01:27:53.398
Let's go, people. Go.

01:28:59.701 --> 01:29:01.692
She looks like you.

01:29:04.339 --> 01:29:05.670
Yeah.

01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:08.368
Yeah, there's a bit of her dad
in there, too.

01:29:11.212 --> 01:29:12.201
I'm...

01:29:13.515 --> 01:29:15.506
I'm sorry.

01:29:37.439 --> 01:29:42.877
Miss Pratt. Our office in Berlin
has detained the morgue director.

01:29:42.944 --> 01:29:45.435
They'd like you
to I.D. A picture of him.

01:29:45.513 --> 01:29:47.504
Can it wait?

01:29:51.553 --> 01:29:52.542
Sure.

01:30:03.698 --> 01:30:06.258
The vars here, ma'am.
Whenever you're ready.

01:30:18.346 --> 01:30:20.337
Honey, look.

01:30:22.517 --> 01:30:25.179
I told you there was a little girl.

01:30:30.558 --> 01:30:32.549
She never gave up.

01:30:36.998 --> 01:30:38.989
Mommy?

01:30:45.673 --> 01:30:47.698
Hi, honey.

01:30:47.776 --> 01:30:50.973
- Mommy?
- Yeah, I'm right here.

01:30:51.713 --> 01:30:53.704
Mommy's right here, baby.

01:30:56.117 --> 01:30:58.745
Are we there yet?

01:31:00.855 --> 01:31:02.345
Not yet.

01:31:02.423 --> 01:31:04.414
Almost.

01:31:07.595 --> 01:31:09.256
Here. Hop on up.
