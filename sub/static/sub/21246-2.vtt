WEBVTT

00:05.939 --> 00:08.906
The crowd was, er...

00:08.969 --> 00:10.009
I mean, he was thirsty.

00:11.033 --> 00:14.001
There was a big crowd
watching the game.

00:15.065 --> 00:18.004
I was holding his hand.

00:18.005 --> 00:20.065
I don't blame you, love.

00:21.859 --> 00:22.919
Olly!

00:23.927 --> 00:26.894
I came back.

00:26.895 --> 00:28.867
I thought you should know why.

00:29.899 --> 00:31.939
I found something.

00:39.965 --> 00:42.024
As you've probably noticed,

00:42.025 --> 00:44.040
the gaskets have gone to rot.

00:44.041 --> 00:48.000
The soil pipes and the stacks
are rusted.

00:48.001 --> 00:52.960
So for those of you who don't
speak plumbing,

00:52.961 --> 00:56.001
refitting this system is going to be
an absolute bastard.

00:57.009 --> 00:58.985
Pardon my French.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.074

01:11.013 --> 01:15.005
Now, it's important that you
understand what we're doing here.

01:16.041 --> 01:19.960
We're trying to get a heartbeat

01:19.961 --> 01:22.992
out of a building that died

01:22.993 --> 01:24.981
over three centuries ago.

01:26.025 --> 01:28.988
As we restore,

01:28.989 --> 01:34.009
we need to cling on to every morsel
of historic fabric...

01:52.957 --> 01:56.004
Anyway, you've all
worked with me before.

01:56.005 --> 01:59.032
You know I'm a stickler for detail.

01:59.033 --> 02:02.965
But this isn't just
one of our development jobs.

02:03.993 --> 02:07.029
One day this will be my home.

03:00.985 --> 03:05.985
TV: 'If you have him, we are
begging you, please let him go.

03:07.009 --> 03:10.989
'Take him to somewhere safe
and let the police know where he is.

03:13.017 --> 03:16.972
'Please bring him
back to his family,

03:16.973 --> 03:19.012
'who love him.

03:19.013 --> 03:21.960
'Please bring him home.

03:21.961 --> 03:23.965
'Please.'

05:34.981 --> 05:37.016
Now, who loves you? Dad.

05:37.017 --> 05:38.968
Yeah.

05:38.969 --> 05:40.973
Cheers, bruv.

05:55.973 --> 05:58.036
Hi, it's Mark Walsh.
I'm the UK liaison officer.

05:58.037 --> 06:00.012
Laurence Relaud.
Do you speak English?

06:00.013 --> 06:02.000
Yes, I do. Thank God.

06:02.001 --> 06:03.972
So what's happening?

06:03.973 --> 06:05.036
This is Vincent Bourg.

06:05.037 --> 06:07.968
Baptiste picked him out from our
list of sex offenders

06:07.969 --> 06:09.024
in the district.

06:09.025 --> 06:11.052
Do you think he's our guy?

06:11.053 --> 06:13.044
Yes.

06:13.045 --> 06:15.969
Yes, I do.

06:26.999 --> 07:12.071
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

07:37.025 --> 07:39.969
Show me. Er...

07:42.009 --> 07:45.988
So, Oliver drew this
the day that he was taken.

07:45.989 --> 07:49.025
It's the same as the one down there.
You can see that, right?

07:51.989 --> 07:55.032
I see the similarity,
of course, but... Similarity?

07:55.033 --> 07:58.964
It's identical to the one in
the basement. He drew that in there.

07:58.965 --> 08:01.004
He was kept in there, I know it.

08:01.005 --> 08:03.001
Julien?

08:05.961 --> 08:08.052
You are a parent too now,
aren't you?

08:08.053 --> 08:10.956
For my sins. Six months.

08:10.957 --> 08:13.972
So... you understand.

08:13.973 --> 08:16.041
As well as anyone might try to.

08:17.037 --> 08:21.980
But... what if you are clinging
to shadows, Tony?

08:21.981 --> 08:24.141
I cannot simply tell the procureur
to re-open this case

08:24.166 --> 08:25.976
because of a picture.

08:25.977 --> 08:28.000
Oh, Jesus Christ, am I going mad?

08:28.001 --> 08:30.968
That is the same as that!

08:30.969 --> 08:33.980
I am asking you to try, Laurence.

08:33.981 --> 08:35.989
As a friend.

08:41.993 --> 08:45.016
I'll talk to the procureur
as soon as I can.

08:45.017 --> 08:47.032
Thank you. Thank you.

08:47.033 --> 08:50.052
I cannot make any promises. OK.

08:50.053 --> 08:52.996
Vin rouge.

08:52.997 --> 08:54.973
Whiskey.

08:56.001 --> 08:58.037
You pay now.

09:02.017 --> 09:04.976
Je n'ai pas de, um...

09:04.977 --> 09:07.048
I don't suppose
these are on the house?

09:07.049 --> 09:09.980
Didn't think so.
C'est bon, c'est bon.

09:09.981 --> 09:13.004
C'est pour moi, merci. Merci.

09:13.005 --> 09:15.052
So what happens now, huh?

09:15.053 --> 09:17.000
They'll send forensics in, eh?

09:17.001 --> 09:19.960
Go over the whole scene
for fingerprints and DNA?

09:19.961 --> 09:21.441
I mean, there's a chance,
isn't there?

09:21.466 --> 09:23.968
That basement looks like it
hasn't been touched in years.

09:23.969 --> 09:25.976
Listen,
this is not Laurence's decision.

09:25.977 --> 09:27.297
I know she'll do her best, but...

09:27.322 --> 09:29.008
In the meantime,
we should go through this.

09:29.009 --> 09:32.008
Now we have an address, maybe there's
something in here that we missed.

09:32.009 --> 09:34.984
Something that ties
the two together.

09:34.985 --> 09:36.988
Please, Tony. Tony, please.

09:36.989 --> 09:38.960
One step at a time.

09:38.961 --> 09:41.001
I know. I know.

09:46.017 --> 09:48.984
You've got the police reports?

09:48.985 --> 09:51.145
Yeah, everything's in there.
Every article, every lead.

09:51.170 --> 09:53.158
I mean, I've got more here.

09:55.025 --> 09:58.964
Some of these
documents are in French.

09:58.965 --> 10:00.988
Vous avez appris a parler francais?

10:00.989 --> 10:03.997
I mean, I read it better
than I speak it.

10:08.973 --> 10:13.024
Emily.
I was calling her all last night.

10:13.025 --> 10:17.021
Um... It's a bit loud in here.
I'm going to go outside.

10:20.025 --> 10:23.996
Emily, thanks for calling back.
'No, Tony. It's me. Mark.'

10:23.997 --> 10:27.008
Now is not a good time. 'Yeah,
well, I need to speak to her.'

10:27.009 --> 10:29.964
It's Robert. He's getting worse.

10:29.965 --> 10:31.020
Oh, Jesus.

10:31.021 --> 10:34.044
Penny told me he was in the hospice.
I was going to call, but... 'Yeah.

10:34.045 --> 10:36.984
'Well, it's not the right time.'
I know.

10:36.985 --> 10:40.980
I know. But listen to me. I've found
something. We could find Oliver.

10:40.981 --> 10:45.044
Listen! Don't phone back!
This has got nothing to do with you.

10:45.045 --> 10:46.977
Hello?

10:59.021 --> 11:00.988
That's good, Dad.

11:00.989 --> 11:03.053
Try and have a bit more.

11:04.997 --> 11:06.052
Hey.

11:06.053 --> 11:09.960
Who was it? Carol. She wanted to
know about numbers at the venue.

11:09.961 --> 11:11.024
It's nothing. With me?

11:11.025 --> 11:14.004
My phone was off,
so she tried yours.

11:14.005 --> 11:17.960
Hey. I am capable of answering
my own phone, you know? I know.

11:17.961 --> 11:20.024
It's just wedmin,
don't worry about it.

11:20.025 --> 11:21.984
Wedmin?

11:21.985 --> 11:23.036
Wedding admin.

11:23.037 --> 11:26.029
Which I've done none of. I love it.

11:28.033 --> 11:32.996
Hey. Come on, sleepy drawers.
It's time to go home.

11:32.997 --> 11:36.973
I want to stay. I know, but it's time
to go home. Come on, up.

11:44.017 --> 11:46.004
Oliver?

11:46.005 --> 11:48.012
Oliver, how are you?

11:48.013 --> 11:49.969
How's school?

11:52.977 --> 11:54.049
Dad, this is James.

11:56.001 --> 11:58.021
Oliver, come here...

11:59.989 --> 12:03.025
Dad, this is James. Mark's son.
Oliver's not here any more.

12:06.053 --> 12:07.993
Home time.

12:25.005 --> 12:26.965
Oh, phone?

13:24.025 --> 13:26.973
'Hello?' Did I wake you?

13:28.001 --> 13:29.993
Tu sais bien que non.

13:31.029 --> 13:33.029
Curse of being a night owl. Hm.

13:35.029 --> 13:38.008
How is the hive?

13:38.009 --> 13:41.008
'Fine, as far as I can tell.

13:41.009 --> 13:43.020
'But I'm not the expert.

13:43.021 --> 13:45.988
'Only you know what's really
going on in there.'

13:45.989 --> 13:47.960
I'll be back soon.

13:47.961 --> 13:50.968
As soon as the case is reopened,
Laurence will take over

13:50.969 --> 13:52.004
and I can come home.

13:52.005 --> 13:53.032
I promise.

13:53.033 --> 13:55.041
Don't make promises you can't keep.

14:01.041 --> 14:04.000
Oh. I have to go.

14:04.001 --> 14:05.992
I love you.

14:05.993 --> 14:08.016
I love you too, Julien.

14:08.017 --> 14:11.992
Although sometimes
I can't remember why.

14:11.993 --> 14:13.961
Soon you will know.

14:39.977 --> 14:43.028
What's going on?
No-one's telling us anything.

14:43.029 --> 14:46.964
So, they're currently questioning
a person of interest. Who is he?

14:46.965 --> 14:49.036
They won't release
the suspect's name.

14:49.037 --> 14:52.016
Look, the process here is
different from at home, OK?

14:52.017 --> 14:53.097
But from what I understand,

14:53.122 --> 14:56.048
there is a witness who can place him
at the pool.

14:56.049 --> 15:01.004
He denies it, but he's a regular
there and his alibi is, um...

15:01.005 --> 15:03.004
It's unsatisfactory.

15:03.005 --> 15:05.976
He claims he was out
walking in the local park,

15:05.977 --> 15:09.960
but no-one can confirm that.
And, um... is he...

15:09.961 --> 15:11.004
I mean...

15:11.005 --> 15:13.016
Does he have a history?

15:13.017 --> 15:14.976
We can't discuss that.

15:14.977 --> 15:16.040
Oh, God!

15:16.041 --> 15:18.021
That means he does, doesn't it?

15:19.985 --> 15:22.984
Look, it's important
not to think too far ahead.

15:22.985 --> 15:25.016
Right now,
we have someone we're talking to.

15:25.017 --> 15:28.964
Yeah, but if he's done this before,
that means he's not a killer,

15:28.965 --> 15:32.956
doesn't it? Which means... Cos he'd
be in jail, wouldn't he? Stop it!

15:32.957 --> 15:35.008
For Christ's sake, just...

15:35.009 --> 15:38.976
I can only imagine how hard
this is for you. For all of you.

15:38.977 --> 15:42.028
And I promise that the moment
I know anything, anything at all,

15:42.029 --> 15:44.956
I will let you know.

15:44.957 --> 15:47.013
But for now, we just have to wait.

15:48.985 --> 15:50.964
You have my card, right? Yeah.

15:50.965 --> 15:53.053
Thank you. Thank you.

16:09.981 --> 16:11.016
What's he saying?

16:11.017 --> 16:13.016
Um...

16:13.017 --> 16:16.020
Baptiste wants to know why he ran.
He says he panicked.

16:16.021 --> 16:19.017
He's afraid of the police
because of his record.

16:23.969 --> 16:27.009
Baptiste wants to know where
he walked.

16:29.005 --> 16:32.008
Where he was at the time the boy
went missing.

16:32.009 --> 16:33.968
The park.

16:33.969 --> 16:36.005
Off la Rue Jean Buridan, he says.

16:39.017 --> 16:42.980
Ca suffit, tes conneries la.
Lachez-le. Alle? Alle ou?

16:42.981 --> 16:46.028
Il est ou, le gamin? Il est ou,
espece de sale pervert?!

16:46.029 --> 16:47.973
Lachez-le, tout de suite.

16:50.961 --> 16:52.044
Tu m'as fait mal.

16:52.045 --> 16:57.964
Il m'a fait mal,
vous avez tous vu. Il m'a...

16:57.965 --> 17:02.005
On va noter dans la malcourante.
Je suis desole. Vraiment desole, monsieur.

17:05.969 --> 17:07.961
He's asking about the park again.

17:10.029 --> 17:14.016
He is... looking for...

17:14.017 --> 17:16.955
um... incoherences... um...

17:16.957 --> 17:18.961
Inconsistencies. Yes.

17:25.009 --> 17:28.020
No, no, no, no, no.
They are on the house.

17:28.021 --> 17:29.993
Et les croissants aussi.

17:35.973 --> 17:37.044
Everyone's being so nice.

17:37.045 --> 17:38.960
I'm not hungry.

17:38.961 --> 17:39.965
Me neither.

17:44.005 --> 17:47.964
Maybe we should try and eat some
of it, you know, just to be polite.

17:47.965 --> 17:50.325
What if that man who took him
has him locked up somewhere...

17:51.969 --> 17:54.968
..and we're just sitting here
being polite? I didn't mean...

17:54.969 --> 17:57.000
What if that man knows
where Olly is,

17:57.001 --> 17:58.984
he knows where he is?

17:58.985 --> 18:01.968
We're just sitting here having
coffee like we're still on holiday?

18:01.969 --> 18:03.249
What else are we supposed to do?

18:03.274 --> 18:06.000
Sit and think about what might have
happened? What good does that do?

18:06.001 --> 18:08.981
No, you're right, just sit here
and be polite.

18:12.997 --> 18:14.969
I'll see you back at the hotel.

18:24.001 --> 18:27.009
That's Bourg's file.
No-one can know where you got it.

18:28.025 --> 18:32.048
Ah, mais c'est deguelasse!
Mais c'est... So... Bourg's got
no-one to confirm his alibi,

18:32.049 --> 18:36.956
and he was seen at the swimming pool
the day Oliver Hughes went missing?

18:36.957 --> 18:40.036
No, not for sure. The attendants,
they are saying they recognise him.

18:40.037 --> 18:42.976
That he comes in all the time,
that he come in that day...

18:42.977 --> 18:46.020
Yeah, but he's been done for
child pornography though, right?

18:46.021 --> 18:47.052
Done?

18:47.053 --> 18:50.020
Yeah, done. Er, charged.
Found guilty.

18:50.021 --> 18:52.969
Oh, yeah, yeah. Two separate terms.
It's all in here.

18:59.009 --> 19:02.976
So is this your... titre?
Your headline?

19:02.977 --> 19:06.008
"Why was this man allowed to
walk the streets? Down with France."

19:06.009 --> 19:08.036
What I write is
none of your concern.

19:08.037 --> 19:11.004
When you publish Mr Bourg's name,
it will be my concern.

19:11.005 --> 19:13.040
Because they would
like to know who told you.

19:13.041 --> 19:15.977
And how you got
the information in that file.

19:17.993 --> 19:22.004
You write for local news, huh?
Local newspaper.

19:22.005 --> 19:25.024
So, you've done your research, then?

19:25.025 --> 19:27.037
You're not even a proper journalist.

19:30.041 --> 19:31.985
I have everything I need.

19:33.957 --> 19:36.037
You'll be seeing it
in the papers tonight.

19:48.017 --> 19:50.024
Well, thank you.

19:50.025 --> 19:51.973
Yeah, I know.

19:54.009 --> 19:55.969
Well, that means a lot.

19:59.973 --> 20:01.973
Yup. Will do.

20:03.977 --> 20:04.989
Thanks.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.045
That was Peter.

20:11.973 --> 20:14.988
They're going to give me
as much paid leave as I want.

20:14.989 --> 20:16.964
I'm sorry.

20:16.965 --> 20:17.969
No.

20:19.965 --> 20:21.009
I'm so sorry.

20:24.965 --> 20:26.016
Where did you go?

20:26.017 --> 20:28.960
I just went for a walk.

20:28.961 --> 20:30.968
You were gone ages.

20:30.969 --> 20:32.016
I didn't mean to... snap.

20:32.017 --> 20:34.973
No, don't worry,
no... it's the both of us.

21:55.037 --> 21:57.032
C'est bon, c'est bon.

21:57.033 --> 22:01.017
Mr Walsh.
Would you care to join us?

22:02.961 --> 22:04.985
Sure.

22:06.049 --> 22:13.001
He's hiding something. Erm, I have
an idea and... I need your help.

22:22.973 --> 22:25.032
Cafe, monsieur...

22:25.033 --> 22:27.021
Merci.

22:35.977 --> 22:39.956
Vous parlez anglais, Monsieur Bourg?
Oui.

22:39.957 --> 22:43.005
This gentleman is Mark Walsh.
He works for Interpol.

22:45.001 --> 22:48.984
Well, it seems our officers have
had great difficulty

22:48.985 --> 22:52.048
tracing your IP address back
to your computer.

22:52.049 --> 22:55.032
Well now, I don't even know what
an IP address is,

22:55.033 --> 22:58.000
technology these days.

22:58.001 --> 23:00.984
Mr Walsh is here to help us.

23:00.985 --> 23:04.036
He is a specialist in
computer crime.

23:04.037 --> 23:08.032
You see, storing your hard drive
off premises or using a proxy VPN

23:08.033 --> 23:11.004
isn't enough these days, Vincent.

23:11.005 --> 23:14.985
Well, we found it... and as we speak
they're combing it for images.

23:19.033 --> 23:24.028
Well, as you are on the register,
Mr Bourg, you know

23:24.029 --> 23:28.957
the implications if we are to find
any damaging materials on there?

23:30.037 --> 23:32.997
This is your chance to
tell your side.

23:44.029 --> 23:45.053
I want the lawyer.

23:48.013 --> 23:52.960
This will be easier for you if you
tell us what you know, Vincent.

23:52.961 --> 23:54.960
Any connections that could help us,
it's...

23:54.961 --> 23:55.973
I want a lawyer.

23:57.969 --> 23:59.968
Andre Chassaus.

23:59.969 --> 24:03.956
That's his name. Call him.

24:03.957 --> 24:04.993
That is your right.

24:06.965 --> 24:10.049
As is choosing the same lawyer that
landed you in jail the last time.

24:19.037 --> 24:22.981
Perhaps I will need
alternative representation.

24:25.029 --> 24:27.053
I'll bring you a list.

24:35.041 --> 24:39.980
Vous l'avez fait transpirer?
He believed us. He thinks we've got
something on him.

24:39.981 --> 24:41.001
Well, for now.

24:42.961 --> 24:45.001
Moi, j'ai dit qu'il faut continuer
l'interrogatoire.

24:46.033 --> 24:50.012
I think we should keep pushing.

24:50.013 --> 24:51.048
How long have we got?

24:51.049 --> 24:55.964
Well... Chassaus would have had him
out of here in half an hour.

24:55.965 --> 24:57.984
But now he's looking for
a new lawyer...

24:57.985 --> 25:01.016
trying to find someone who will even
take the case could take a while.

25:01.017 --> 25:02.996
Giving you enough time to break him?

25:02.997 --> 25:06.984
Whether he took Oliver Hughes
or not, he is troubled,

25:06.985 --> 25:08.973
obviously, something's wrong.

25:10.009 --> 25:12.957
I'm afraid things will not
end well for him.

25:20.961 --> 25:22.969
And are you on any other medication?

25:23.977 --> 25:24.989
No.

25:28.981 --> 25:31.052
This treatment's
only in its infancy, Mr Bourg.

25:31.053 --> 25:34.997
We're piloting it to a limited
cross-section of offenders.

25:36.977 --> 25:38.005
People like me.

25:42.053 --> 25:43.981
Does it work?

25:45.017 --> 25:47.017
It's an effective treatment, yes.

25:48.965 --> 25:51.956
But if we are to proceed,
you need to understand the possible

25:51.957 --> 25:53.988
side-effects of tryptorelin.

25:53.989 --> 25:56.980
Weight loss, lethargy, depression,

25:56.981 --> 25:59.025
emotional lability are not
uncommon...

26:00.033 --> 26:01.037
I understand.

26:03.009 --> 26:04.029
But you're unsure?

26:08.021 --> 26:09.045
I'm afraid.

26:13.005 --> 26:15.993
I'm afraid to rely on something
so greatly that...

26:17.053 --> 26:20.025
..without it I will be... nothing...

26:23.041 --> 26:25.013
..empty.

26:29.961 --> 26:31.985
No. I'm sorry.

26:39.961 --> 26:41.005
I will do this myself.

26:43.973 --> 26:45.013
I'm sorry for your time.

26:51.013 --> 26:53.032
Did Laurence even try to get
the case reopened?

26:53.033 --> 26:55.024
I'm sure she tried to do her best.

26:55.025 --> 26:57.040
But we've got a chance with
the mayor?

26:57.041 --> 27:01.972
It's possible. The mayor has no
power over the justice department.

27:01.973 --> 27:04.972
But the realities of power
are nothing to do with

27:04.973 --> 27:06.012
the letter of the law.

27:06.013 --> 27:09.032
He was here when it happened.
He'll understand. It's my hope.

27:09.033 --> 27:13.972
But he must be handled carefully so,
please, let me do the talking.

27:13.973 --> 27:14.980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:14.981 --> 27:17.985
Monsieur Baptiste, Mr Hughes.

27:18.985 --> 27:21.016
Malik Suri, we've met before.

27:21.017 --> 27:22.040
What do you want?

27:22.041 --> 27:23.964
I heard you were back here.

27:23.965 --> 27:25.024
How?

27:25.025 --> 27:27.048
So... have you found anything?

27:27.049 --> 27:29.968
I gather you and Monsieur Baptiste
have been making

27:29.969 --> 27:31.016
enquiries all over town.

27:31.017 --> 27:33.024
You really think I'd help you
after what you did?

27:33.025 --> 27:36.040
And what did I do?
All I did was my job.

27:36.041 --> 27:37.976
Really?

27:37.977 --> 27:40.020
Go home, Mr Suri.
There's nothing for you here.

27:40.021 --> 27:43.997
When you've had the chance to think
about it, please, give me a call.

27:54.961 --> 27:57.976
I imagine you know why we are here,
Monsieur le Maire.

27:57.977 --> 28:00.964
Captain Mureaux denied
a request from Detective Relaud

28:00.965 --> 28:02.968
to reopen the Oliver Hughes case.

28:02.969 --> 28:03.984
Yes.

28:03.985 --> 28:08.017
I felt if you heard our case
in person, you might reconsider.

28:12.013 --> 28:15.972
Years ago, I would go to Le Beffroi,
the Belfry Hotel,

28:15.973 --> 28:18.000
for a drink after work every night.

28:18.001 --> 28:22.960
I would often meet my niece,
who worked there, and we would talk.

28:22.961 --> 28:25.008
About nothing very much, at first,

28:25.009 --> 28:29.037
but in time we came
to enjoy our chats a great deal.

28:31.973 --> 28:35.012
You know, Chalons Du Bois
is a small town.

28:35.013 --> 28:37.976
It's not Paris, of course,
it's not even Lille,

28:37.977 --> 28:40.960
but there was a time that people
would pass through here

28:40.961 --> 28:42.161
and sometimes they would stay.

28:43.045 --> 28:47.992
And then...
Then we became a ghost town.

28:47.993 --> 28:52.040
People would go out of their way
to avoid us if they saw us on a map.

28:52.041 --> 28:54.988
Le Beffroi closed down.

28:54.989 --> 28:56.972
My niece lost her job,

28:56.973 --> 29:00.020
and now I see her only rarely,
and it's not the same.

29:00.021 --> 29:04.000
But I'm sure you still go for that
drink after work each day, yes?

29:04.001 --> 29:05.032
Yes, of course.

29:05.033 --> 29:07.992
L'Esperance around the corner
has Meteor on draught

29:07.993 --> 29:09.956
and a billiards table so...

29:09.957 --> 29:11.992
So life goes on for all of us.

29:11.993 --> 29:14.048
But not for Mr Hughes.

29:14.049 --> 29:15.992
Look.

29:15.993 --> 29:18.021
What he has found is real.

29:19.033 --> 29:22.960
Evidence of where his son
was kept when he was taken.

29:22.961 --> 29:27.956
This is the scarf Oliver Hughes was
wearing on the day he went missing.

29:27.957 --> 29:30.988
We've traced it back to
a house in Chalons.

29:30.989 --> 29:32.965
70 Rue de la Montagne.

29:33.981 --> 29:38.004
If you reopen the case, there is
every chance we will find the truth.

29:38.005 --> 29:41.985
And, um, every chance
we'll find my son.

29:43.001 --> 29:44.977
Please. Er...

29:48.973 --> 29:53.000
I've lost everything
and everyone I ever cared for.

29:53.001 --> 29:55.016
This is all I have left.

29:55.017 --> 29:56.993
Don't stand in the way.

30:00.961 --> 30:02.996
I have reviewed the evidence,

30:02.997 --> 30:04.985
as did Captain Mureaux.

30:06.001 --> 30:08.992
I see no reason for me
to interfere in police matters

30:08.993 --> 30:11.040
and insist we reopen
some old wounds.

30:11.041 --> 30:13.980
We need a forensic team
in that basement,

30:13.981 --> 30:15.181
we need to see what they find.

30:15.206 --> 30:18.008
I am very sorry for you, Mr Hughes.

30:18.009 --> 30:19.976
I truly am.

30:19.977 --> 30:21.996
But it has been eight years now.

30:21.997 --> 30:25.028
Perhaps it's time to leave the past
where it belongs.

30:25.029 --> 30:28.968
You're not listening to us. You have
got a chance to do something,

30:28.969 --> 30:31.040
and you're just sat there
refusing to...

30:31.041 --> 30:33.045
Thank you for your time.

30:41.013 --> 30:42.049
A bientot.

30:46.969 --> 30:48.005
Tony.

30:54.977 --> 30:56.017
Tony!

31:00.041 --> 31:04.052
Tony! So what? We're just supposed
to roll over and give up?

31:04.053 --> 31:05.980
We're so close.

31:05.981 --> 31:08.996
We know the room where Olly was
kept, that's got to mean something!

31:08.997 --> 31:10.964
We'll find a way. Give me time.

31:10.965 --> 31:13.020
Time? That's a joke, Julien.
It's been eight years.

31:13.021 --> 31:15.992
Oh, please, Tony. I don't need you.
I don't need them.

31:15.993 --> 31:17.957
I'll finish this myself.

31:35.977 --> 31:36.993
Emily.

31:38.973 --> 31:40.032
Greg. Hi.

31:40.033 --> 31:42.049
I was wondering if I'd run into you.

31:46.017 --> 31:49.992
Thanks again for getting Dad in
here. This place has really helped.

31:49.993 --> 31:51.961
It's fine. Any time.

31:54.053 --> 31:56.045
God, it's been an age.

31:58.993 --> 32:00.961
I haven't seen you since... Yes.

32:05.021 --> 32:07.980
I'm praying for you, every day...

32:07.981 --> 32:09.960
It must be nice.

32:09.961 --> 32:12.012
What?

32:12.013 --> 32:14.025
Believing in something.

32:16.973 --> 32:19.961
Do you want me to ask the...
No. Thank you.

32:21.965 --> 32:22.997
I should go.

32:24.009 --> 32:25.996
It was good to see you again.

32:25.997 --> 32:27.961
Hey, you too.

33:06.033 --> 33:07.981
Hey.

33:09.049 --> 33:13.020
I worked the night shift so
I wouldn't have to deal with kids.

33:13.021 --> 33:14.996
You know, they're a pain.

33:14.997 --> 33:16.973
OK. Do you mind?

33:18.021 --> 33:19.957
I'm on my break.

33:21.997 --> 33:23.044
Yeah.

33:23.045 --> 33:26.965
Yeah, can I get chicken nuggets
and a burger, thanks.

33:44.045 --> 33:46.009
Here, take it.

33:49.013 --> 33:50.041
Oi!

34:22.009 --> 34:24.004
Mr and Mrs Hughes.

34:24.005 --> 34:25.053
Hi.

34:28.033 --> 34:29.972
Sorry. Hi.

34:29.973 --> 34:31.972
My name's Malik Suri.

34:31.973 --> 34:34.969
Please forgive my directness
but, er...

34:36.033 --> 34:38.976
Well, I think it's time
you gave an interview.

34:38.976 --> 34:41.097
You're a journalist?
How the hell did you get in here?

34:41.121 --> 34:45.007
People want to hear your story. This
is a hotel, with rooms available.

34:45.009 --> 34:46.027
Let's go.

34:46.029 --> 34:49.032
Quite frankly,
you're not good for business.

34:49.033 --> 34:50.980
Say that again.

34:50.981 --> 34:54.956
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.
I've no intention of upsetting you.

34:54.956 --> 34:58.005
My intentions are
quite the opposite. I want to help.

35:00.049 --> 35:04.000
This is the police file of the man
currently being questioned.

35:04.001 --> 35:05.973
His name's Vincent Bourg.

35:13.037 --> 35:15.008
Why would you give us this?

35:15.009 --> 35:17.996
To show you I can give you more
information than the police will.

35:17.997 --> 35:20.036
Who are you? He's a journalist.

35:20.037 --> 35:23.020
Look, if you think that liaison
officer is here to help you,

35:23.021 --> 35:24.992
he's not - he's here to manage you.

35:24.993 --> 35:26.008
Get out.

35:26.009 --> 35:27.968
All right, all right.

35:27.969 --> 35:31.044
Look, I can promise you, whatever
the police know, you will know too.

35:31.045 --> 35:32.976
I have my sources.

35:32.977 --> 35:34.024
Get out of here!

35:34.025 --> 35:36.997
When you're ready to talk,
please, call me.

35:41.981 --> 35:43.017
OK.

36:07.049 --> 36:09.012
Who are they?

36:09.013 --> 36:12.052
The witnesses who confirm
Bourg's alibi.

36:12.053 --> 36:14.028
Are they reliable?

36:14.029 --> 36:17.984
Well, he is the CEO
of a cancer research charity

36:17.985 --> 36:20.981
and she teaches
at the University of Lille.

36:22.957 --> 36:27.000
They live near the park, Rue Jean
Buridan, and they are both sure

36:27.001 --> 36:30.993
they saw Bourg out walking
in that park during our timeframe.

37:17.997 --> 37:19.037
Au revoir. Au revoir.

37:33.977 --> 37:37.036
But... he went to the pool. Regularly.

37:37.037 --> 37:39.972
The guy knows the place. He's sick.

37:39.973 --> 37:42.036
He wasn't at the pool.
He was out walking.

37:42.037 --> 37:44.964
A couple who live by the park
spotted him.

37:44.965 --> 37:47.205
What does that mean?
How can they be sure? It's reliable.

37:49.001 --> 37:51.028
No. No, no, no.
You're missing something.

37:51.029 --> 37:54.964
Vincent Bourg's just going
to walk straight out of there?!

37:54.965 --> 37:58.964
How do you know his name?
That information wasn't released.

37:58.965 --> 38:00.245
Officers said it at the station.

38:03.981 --> 38:06.956
Look, I know it's not
what you want to hear,

38:06.957 --> 38:08.956
but the alibi is rock solid.

38:08.957 --> 38:12.008
Whatever Bourg did,
he didn't take your son.

38:12.009 --> 38:13.024
I'm sorry.

38:13.025 --> 38:15.961
I promise we're doing
everything we can.

39:30.001 --> 39:32.988
Blessed be God in His Angels
and in His Saints.

39:32.989 --> 39:36.044
Oh, Holy St Anthony,
gentlest of Saints,

39:36.045 --> 39:40.000
your love for God and charity
for His creatures made you worthy

39:40.001 --> 39:43.960
when on Earth
to possess miraculous powers.

39:43.961 --> 39:47.008
Miracles waited on your word
for which you were ever ready

39:47.009 --> 39:49.973
to speak for those in trouble
or anxiety.

39:51.969 --> 39:53.017
And so I beg you...

39:58.005 --> 39:59.961
I'm begging you.

40:02.977 --> 40:04.045
Find my son...

40:06.001 --> 40:08.017
..and bring him home to me.

40:12.001 --> 40:13.969
Find my son...

40:15.997 --> 40:17.077
..and bring him home to me.

40:19.989 --> 40:21.993
Find my son.

40:44.005 --> 40:47.029
Oh, sorry. Excuse me.
Emily, come here.

40:48.053 --> 40:50.040
This is Ian.

40:50.041 --> 40:53.032
Ian Garrett. A pleasure to meet you.

40:53.033 --> 40:55.964
Hi. Bit late for an interview,
isn't it?

40:55.965 --> 40:57.036
Ian's not a journalist.

40:57.037 --> 40:59.956
I'm in construction.

40:59.957 --> 41:02.993
We're doing a build
up at Audresselles and...

41:04.025 --> 41:06.992
..I saw your wee boy on the TV.

41:06.993 --> 41:08.961
Ian, er...

41:10.025 --> 41:12.036
He's put up a 100,000 euro reward

41:12.037 --> 41:15.008
for anyone with any information
about Oliver.

41:15.009 --> 41:17.004
It keeps up public awareness.

41:17.005 --> 41:18.993
That's very kind of you.

41:20.985 --> 41:23.000
Why would you do such a thing?

41:23.001 --> 41:25.024
I don't mean to sound
ungrateful, I just...

41:25.025 --> 41:28.000
Look, I've got
a construction business.

41:28.001 --> 41:33.028
But on the side, my passion is doing
up old buildings, renovating them.

41:33.029 --> 41:35.013
I keep the past alive...

41:36.997 --> 41:38.981
..even when it seems impossible.

41:40.969 --> 41:44.969
Listen, a few years ago,
we got a few French backers.

41:45.981 --> 41:49.016
IGC's been expanding
through Europe ever since.

41:49.017 --> 41:53.021
And to tell you the truth,
I've got more money than I need.

41:54.037 --> 41:56.053
And when I saw your boy
on the telly...

41:57.993 --> 41:59.037
..I knew I could help.

42:01.017 --> 42:02.961
I want to help.

42:07.013 --> 42:09.968
Look, I'd best be off.

42:09.969 --> 42:12.989
It's late and you two need
to try and get some rest.

42:14.009 --> 42:18.004
I've left my details in case
you need me for anything.

42:18.005 --> 42:20.021
Listen, Ian, thank you. Really.

42:21.029 --> 42:22.033
Thank you.

42:27.985 --> 42:29.049
Unbelievable.

42:38.969 --> 42:40.985
Where have you been?
I was worried.

42:44.033 --> 42:48.049
I just went for a walk
to get some perspective.

42:49.997 --> 42:51.037
Did it work?

42:55.961 --> 42:57.021
I hope so.

43:19.009 --> 43:20.996
You burning the midnight oil?

43:20.997 --> 43:24.956
Er, sorry, it's, erm... working late.

43:24.957 --> 43:27.005
I've got those statements for you.

43:34.001 --> 43:35.972
Sorry it took so long.

43:35.973 --> 43:37.020
That's England for you.

43:37.021 --> 43:39.977
Releasing something like that
to another government.

43:43.961 --> 43:44.981
Can I, er...?

43:55.993 --> 43:57.033
This is nice.

44:03.989 --> 44:07.964
You know, the Nazis used it
as the official theme music

44:07.965 --> 44:09.325
for their weekly newsreel service.

44:09.350 --> 44:11.984
Even they could see
the beauty in it.

44:11.985 --> 44:14.976
It reminds you that the people
who do these terrible things,

44:14.977 --> 44:16.017
they are just people.

44:17.961 --> 44:19.049
Not some kind of devils.

44:20.965 --> 44:22.041
Just ordinary people.

44:23.993 --> 44:26.049
That's why you wanted Tony Hughes'
bank statements?

44:28.049 --> 44:30.004
You think he could...

44:30.005 --> 44:32.961
I think I need to know everything.
At the moment I don't.

44:45.033 --> 44:49.008
So, I did the piece on him.

44:49.009 --> 44:50.961
On Vincent Bourg.

44:51.053 --> 44:54.984
Yeah. Wrote it. Sent it to them.

44:54.985 --> 44:56.977
They loved it.

44:59.961 --> 45:03.013
Then, about an hour ago,
my copy got pulled.

45:04.997 --> 45:07.045
Do you have any idea
who that was for?

45:09.009 --> 45:10.024
Of course you don't.

45:10.025 --> 45:11.032
Bonjour.

45:11.033 --> 45:13.013
It was for The Telegraph!

45:17.037 --> 45:19.008
I gave you information.

45:19.009 --> 45:21.004
It is not my fault
if he had an alibi.

45:21.005 --> 45:22.048
No, no, no. Information?

45:22.049 --> 45:24.984
You gave me the first thing
you could get hold of.

45:24.985 --> 45:28.008
You gave me Chinese whispers.
You gave me nothing.

45:28.009 --> 45:29.976
What do you want from me?

45:29.977 --> 45:32.005
What do you think I want from you?

45:33.025 --> 45:35.993
I want something I can use.
And I want it quickly.

45:37.965 --> 45:39.964
Why are you like this?

45:39.965 --> 45:42.049
Why am I like this? Yeah.

45:43.981 --> 45:47.053
Some of us want to be remembered
for who we are and what we do.

45:49.013 --> 45:50.981
Clearly you don't.

45:52.977 --> 45:55.049
Don't mistake me, Monsieur Ziane.

45:56.989 --> 45:57.993
I'm serious.

45:59.985 --> 46:01.049
Chamartaines...

46:07.017 --> 46:08.960
I will give you what I can.

46:08.961 --> 46:10.016
Do you think I'm bluffing?

46:10.017 --> 46:11.989
I will give you what I can, OK?!

46:31.005 --> 46:32.037
Bonjour.

46:48.009 --> 46:49.048
You been here all night?

46:49.049 --> 46:50.989
For my sins.

46:52.997 --> 46:54.037
What are you looking at?

46:59.977 --> 47:01.049
Trouble for Tony Hughes.

48:21.965 --> 48:23.957
Who is it? It's nothing.

48:31.961 --> 48:36.029
Marcel. Monsieur. Comme d'habitude,
Monsieur le Maire? Comme d'habitude.

48:41.017 --> 48:45.028
So that's why the bees,
they need to go through the winter

48:45.029 --> 48:47.037
thinking the world outside...

48:49.981 --> 48:51.052
Georges! Bonjour, Julien.

48:51.053 --> 48:53.036
You know Malik Suri...

48:53.037 --> 48:54.961
I know who he is.

48:57.049 --> 48:59.017
What are you doing here?

49:01.005 --> 49:02.973
Having a drink. After work.

49:08.021 --> 49:11.004
Excuse me. Look, I haven't got
all day for this.

49:11.005 --> 49:15.008
We came here to talk about
the Hughes case and all you've done
is talk about your bees.

49:15.009 --> 49:16.025
One moment, please.

49:39.005 --> 49:42.960
TV ON Uh, bonjour.
Bonjour, Monsieur Lombard.

49:42.961 --> 49:44.988
Je m'appelle Tony Hughes.

49:44.989 --> 49:47.976
Do you speak English? Yes.

49:47.977 --> 49:51.968
I'm phoning round everyone
that lived on Rue de la Montagne

49:51.969 --> 49:54.029
eight years ago, it's in conn...
Hello?

50:09.001 --> 50:11.996
You know it was the drinking
that made Alain sick?

50:11.997 --> 50:14.965
You don't need to worry about me,
Sylvie.

50:17.033 --> 50:19.000
Bonsoir.

50:19.001 --> 50:20.017
What is it?

50:21.965 --> 50:23.040
Detective Baptiste.

50:23.041 --> 50:25.048
Monsieur Baptiste now. I am retired.

50:25.049 --> 50:26.053
At last.

50:27.989 --> 50:30.977
Cafe? Avec plaisir, Madame Deloix.
Merci.

50:42.021 --> 50:44.029
Your son's case has been reopened.

50:47.013 --> 50:49.004
How the hell did that happen?

50:49.005 --> 50:50.956
Georges is a politician now.

50:50.957 --> 50:53.040
The last thing men like him
want is uncertainty.

50:53.041 --> 50:56.012
Were a journalist to learn what
we found in that basement,

50:56.013 --> 50:58.964
the Mayor of Chalons Du Bois
would find himself

50:58.965 --> 51:01.020
in a difficult position.
You blackmailed him?

51:01.021 --> 51:04.988
No, I narrowed his options.
The journalist wasn't happy.

51:04.989 --> 51:07.993
But he can now write a nice
article about nectar flow, I think.

51:10.009 --> 51:12.032
Thank you.

51:12.033 --> 51:15.041
Thank you, thank you.

51:19.017 --> 51:22.980
But listen, Georges insisted
it must be kept quiet.

51:22.981 --> 51:25.040
The papers cannot know.
The budget will be limited

51:25.041 --> 51:27.960
and there will be a review
after one month,

51:27.961 --> 51:29.161
to decide if it will continue.

51:29.186 --> 51:31.996
But the case has been reopened.
We're looking for Oliver again.

51:31.997 --> 51:35.960
I need to call Emily...
Tony. Nothing is certain.

51:35.961 --> 51:38.028
To give someone hope
can be a dangerous thing, no?

51:38.029 --> 51:42.044
She has a right to know. Of course.
But at this moment we know nothing.

51:42.045 --> 51:46.044
You and Emily have found very
different ways through this.

51:46.045 --> 51:51.044
All I am saying is, do not
make her promises you cannot keep.

51:51.045 --> 51:53.005
OK.

52:06.001 --> 52:08.008
How long will it take?

52:08.009 --> 52:11.985
The hormone suppressant acts
differently for different people.

52:14.965 --> 52:17.040
But - just press it -

52:17.041 --> 52:20.984
within a few days, the testosterone

52:20.985 --> 52:24.033
in your bloodstream will be
that of a prepubescent child.

52:25.965 --> 52:28.956
Sexual desire will become
a thing of the past.

52:28.957 --> 52:30.021
Good.

52:31.993 --> 52:34.025
What made you decide to come back?

52:44.053 --> 52:48.005
Do you remember that English boy
that went missing in France?

52:50.033 --> 52:51.965
Oliver Hughes?

52:53.017 --> 52:54.997
I got accused.

52:57.009 --> 52:59.964
I was innocent...

52:59.965 --> 53:01.989
of course...

53:03.977 --> 53:06.004
..but it made me realise I...

53:06.005 --> 53:10.024
had to put this sickness
behind me.

53:10.025 --> 53:11.977
I tried.

53:13.045 --> 53:15.977
I really tried.

53:17.021 --> 53:18.981
But I was weak.

53:20.985 --> 53:23.025
I got arrested, again.

53:25.029 --> 53:29.000
I got sent to prison...

53:29.001 --> 53:32.957
for possession of indecent materials.

53:40.013 --> 53:44.016
But now I am free once again,

53:44.017 --> 53:46.049
I must be cured.

54:17.965 --> 54:19.972
Didn't think I'd see you back
so soon.

54:19.973 --> 54:22.964
Well, your ex-husband
and his old friend Baptiste

54:22.965 --> 54:26.032
didn't exactly roll out the red
carpet for me, as you can imagine.

54:26.033 --> 54:28.032
Right.

54:28.033 --> 54:30.004
And?

54:30.005 --> 54:31.988
And.

54:31.989 --> 54:34.016
And Tony's a drunk.

54:34.017 --> 54:36.976
And Baptiste is retired.

54:36.977 --> 54:39.000
Bored, as far as I can tell.

54:39.001 --> 54:42.960
I asked around and apparently
they tried to open the case again,

54:42.961 --> 54:44.964
to appeal it.

54:44.965 --> 54:46.036
That's all you have?

54:46.037 --> 54:50.025
What? That those two lost souls
are out there chasing rainbows?

54:51.049 --> 54:53.985
No. Far from it.

54:54.985 --> 54:57.000
No, I have some information
of my own

54:57.001 --> 54:59.980
that I'm in the process
of corroborating.

54:59.981 --> 55:01.040
If you hurt us again...

55:01.041 --> 55:03.020
Please.

55:03.021 --> 55:06.028
I'm not trying to hurt anyone.

55:06.029 --> 55:08.017
I'm trying to find out the truth.

55:11.997 --> 55:14.972
And if you'd ever agree to a proper
interview with me...

55:14.973 --> 55:16.996
You must be joking.

55:16.997 --> 55:19.005
I know what you did, Emily.

55:21.989 --> 55:23.029
You and Tony.

55:24.993 --> 55:26.957
And I'm going to prove it.

56:18.033 --> 56:19.997
Monsieur Garrett?

56:21.017 --> 56:22.029
Vincent.

56:24.049 --> 56:25.989
Thank you for coming.

56:30.017 --> 56:33.012
Tell me, did you see
the couple in the park?

56:33.013 --> 56:37.036
The ones who gave you the alibi?
They were walking their dog.

56:37.037 --> 56:41.028
Yeah. Yeah, I remember.

56:41.029 --> 56:44.964
You're a terrible liar, Vincent.

56:44.965 --> 56:46.024
They never saw you.

56:46.025 --> 56:47.997
They were paid to say that.

56:49.977 --> 56:52.988
I don't understand.

56:52.989 --> 56:55.957
Why? I...
I didn't do this thing.

56:56.969 --> 56:58.968
I... I didn't hurt this boy.

56:58.969 --> 57:02.976
I believe you, Vincent.
I knew it couldn't have been you.

57:02.977 --> 57:04.977
You haven't got the stomach for it.

57:07.989 --> 57:10.032
Why are you telling me this?

57:10.033 --> 57:13.981
I want you to know
why you're a free man.

57:16.961 --> 57:18.241
You thought I would tell on you?

57:18.266 --> 57:24.008
I was concerned that the longer
the police held you,

57:24.009 --> 57:26.044
the more chance there was of our...

57:26.045 --> 57:28.997
connection coming to the surface.

57:31.009 --> 57:32.968
But it didn't?

57:32.969 --> 57:33.972
No?

57:33.973 --> 57:34.985
Good.

57:37.957 --> 57:43.980
As of this moment
our association is to be terminated.

57:43.981 --> 57:46.049
As far as you're concerned,
we never even met.

57:49.985 --> 57:51.988
I understand.

57:51.989 --> 57:55.333
For your sake, I hope that you do.
