You with the band?

01:54.740 --> 01:56.617
Yeah. Record label.

01:56.700 --> 01:59.745
- You better put that on.
- Yes, sir.

02:10.380 --> 02:11.548
Whoa.

02:11.673 --> 02:14.593
<i>♪ Nothin', nothin' ♪</i>

02:16.219 --> 02:19.765
Guys, cleanup on aisle seven.
What's up, man?

02:27.022 --> 02:30.901
Hi, Leo. Keep playing that thing,
you're gonna go blind.

02:31.026 --> 02:33.320
Matt, where are we on that sit-down
with Elijah?

02:33.403 --> 02:36.323
- I told you, talk to Zeke.
- Zeke said talk to you.

02:36.406 --> 02:37.741
They want the cover.

02:37.824 --> 02:40.243
Jeff won't commit
until he sees the article.

02:40.619 --> 02:42.663
But it's a definite possibility.

02:43.622 --> 02:44.748
Gotta go, Leo.

02:44.831 --> 02:47.167
Come on, Matt.
Is he gonna do it or not?

02:47.250 --> 02:49.252
It's a "definite possibility."

02:58.512 --> 03:00.305
We love you, New York!

03:01.181 --> 03:04.017
- What's up, man?
- Good to see you too!

03:05.394 --> 03:06.937
What's up?

03:10.649 --> 03:12.067
What's up, man?

03:36.091 --> 03:38.343
Elijah. Got a visitor.

03:40.971 --> 03:43.932
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:44.015 --> 03:45.851
- Great set, man.
- Thank you.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.060
Yeah.

03:47.978 --> 03:49.604
- Did you talk to him?
- Not yet.

03:49.688 --> 03:52.524
- Would you talk to him?
- Talk to me about what?

03:56.486 --> 03:58.280
Talk to me about what?

04:00.323 --> 04:02.492
Elijah just signed with Interscope.

04:03.869 --> 04:04.786
What?

04:06.246 --> 04:09.166
Are you fucking joking? What's going on?

04:10.333 --> 04:11.460
You're just slow, man.

04:12.544 --> 04:14.463
"I'm slow"? What do you mean, "I'm slow"?

04:14.546 --> 04:17.339
- He doesn't mean "slow."
- He said, "slow." Shut up, okay?

04:17.423 --> 04:20.218
- What do you mean?
- I haven't had a record out in a year.

04:20.302 --> 04:23.346
So? You're gettin' ready to cut an album.
We just booked a studio.

04:23.472 --> 04:25.891
Look, Interscope's got two songs
ready to go.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.268
And they're fuckin' good.

04:28.351 --> 04:31.354
But they're not yours.
I thought you want to do your own stuff.

04:31.438 --> 04:34.775
We've been telling you for a while now
that we need a new single, okay?

04:37.152 --> 04:39.237
Jesus. Elijah, come on, man.

04:39.321 --> 04:41.907
I got nothing but love for you, man.
Really.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.326
It's not personal.

04:46.953 --> 04:48.330
Yeah.

05:08.767 --> 05:10.185
Good morning, Eve.

05:11.895 --> 05:13.688
- Morning, Matt.
- Hi.

05:14.731 --> 05:17.108
- Does she know about...
- Everyone knows.

05:19.820 --> 05:22.197
Can you pull Elijah's sheet
when you get a chance?

05:23.114 --> 05:25.450
- Thanks.
- Matt Ryder's office. This is Kim.

05:25.534 --> 05:28.245
I'm sorry. Mr. Ryder is in a meeting.
Can you return?

05:28.328 --> 05:30.539
- Thank you.
- Shit. His numbers were holding.

05:30.622 --> 05:33.208
- Rob Marker's office. This is Kim.
- Rob Marker's office?

05:33.291 --> 05:36.545
I'm sorry. I don't have him right now.
Can you return? Great.

05:37.504 --> 05:40.465
- What the hell was that?
- Marker's been promoted.

05:40.715 --> 05:42.133
Really?

05:42.217 --> 05:45.053
And Mr. Lepselter
actually wants to see you right now.

05:47.722 --> 05:48.932
Sit down.

05:53.144 --> 05:54.729
Am I about to get fired?

05:55.355 --> 05:56.439
Sit down.

05:58.650 --> 06:02.612
I've been working for you since
before you could make payroll. Ten years.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.781
I've kept you on at a loss
for the last few.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.992
A loss? Really? Okay.

06:08.451 --> 06:11.663
I brought you a Coldplay demo in '99.
You didn't even listen to it.

06:11.746 --> 06:14.249
Arcade Fire in 2003.
A bootleg and you were like,

06:14.332 --> 06:16.960
"Great in concert.
Won't translate to the airwaves."

06:17.043 --> 06:20.839
Three years ago, I had the Spare Sevens
in the room. In the fucking room.

06:20.922 --> 06:24.759
I blew a few good calls for you. So?
You been cashin' that chit in for years.

06:24.843 --> 06:27.512
I know music better than anybody
in this fuckin' office.

06:27.596 --> 06:31.016
Yeah. You've got a great ear.
That made you irreplaceable in 1998.

06:31.099 --> 06:33.602
- Bullshit. It still matters.
- Music is a commodity.

06:33.685 --> 06:37.397
And it's airborne. You can't protect it.
You can't sell what you can't protect.

06:37.480 --> 06:40.400
You only sell the artist.
You haven't been signing any.

06:40.483 --> 06:43.778
Last night, you let your meal ticket
walk out that door.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.114
Yeah.

06:46.489 --> 06:48.033
Yeah, well...

06:48.992 --> 06:50.577
I'm still working 'em.

06:50.869 --> 06:53.288
- Working who?
- Spare Sevens.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.415
- Spare Sevens?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:55.582 --> 06:56.416
Right.

06:56.499 --> 07:00.629
Hey, I'm not jokin'. No, no, no.
They're not happy at Sony.

07:00.712 --> 07:03.006
The label rushed the last album.
They're pissed.

07:03.131 --> 07:05.133
The Spare Sevens
are about to pop globally.

07:05.216 --> 07:06.760
Sony will make them happy.

07:06.843 --> 07:08.553
No. These guys aren't like Elijah.

07:08.637 --> 07:12.766
They actually take the time to make music
the way real bands used to make it.

07:13.308 --> 07:16.144
I talked to their manager, Dan, at PMO.

07:17.020 --> 07:19.648
- You have a sit-down?
- I will.

07:24.611 --> 07:25.904
I'll give you two weeks.

07:25.987 --> 07:29.658
Not because I owe it to you,
but because I want the Spare Sevens.

07:44.422 --> 07:45.298
Hello.

07:47.676 --> 07:49.761
You have no pictures.

07:50.679 --> 07:53.848
Like, on your walls and your desk.
You don't have any photos.

07:53.932 --> 07:55.725
Who doesn't hang up a picture?

07:55.809 --> 07:57.978
Good question.
Here's another: Who are you?

07:58.061 --> 08:03.024
Most people in the office have photos of
their wife, girlfriend, dog. Something.

08:03.566 --> 08:07.570
Well, my wife left me, don't have
a girlfriend, and I'm afraid of dogs.

08:07.654 --> 08:09.489
I'm sorry to disappoint. Excuse me.

08:09.572 --> 08:11.491
<i>Yes?</i>

08:11.574 --> 08:14.744
Hi. There is a strange woman
standing in my office.

08:14.869 --> 08:16.955
- <i>On my way.</i>
- I am not strange.

08:17.038 --> 08:19.207
- You're a little strange.
- I work for Ben.

08:19.874 --> 08:22.877
Oh, oh, you work for Ben.
Okay, that's great.

08:22.961 --> 08:26.506
- I don't know who that is.
- Benjamin Asher Ryder.

08:26.589 --> 08:28.049
Your father.

08:30.135 --> 08:32.095
Sorry, I'm Zooey Kern.

08:32.178 --> 08:35.140
I'm Ben's nurse/personal assistant.

08:36.307 --> 08:39.394
Listen, Miss Kern. This has already been
a monumentally shitty day,

08:39.477 --> 08:41.813
and I haven't started dealing
with the West Coast.

08:41.895 --> 08:43.398
Hey, Kim!

08:43.481 --> 08:46.276
Not sure what you're doing here.
Honestly, I don't care.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.069
Ben's dying.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.954
Right. See, I thought I covered that
with "I don't care."

08:58.621 --> 09:00.957
- He has liver cancer.
- Uh-huh.

09:01.041 --> 09:04.627
And he's got three months left,
maybe four.

09:05.003 --> 09:08.590
Sorry, Matt. I was in with Marker.
Miss, do you have an appointment?

09:08.673 --> 09:11.426
- Wouldn't you know if she did?
- It was rhetorical.

09:11.509 --> 09:14.054
I need you to show this woman out. Okay?

09:14.137 --> 09:16.306
Then get ahold of Dan Summers
at PMO Talent.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.475
I want to talk to him
about the Spare Sevens.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.518
Actually, just say that it's urgent.

09:20.602 --> 09:22.771
- Rob Marker's office.
- Are you kidding me?

09:27.442 --> 09:29.360
I'll just call security myself.

09:29.444 --> 09:31.362
I don't think you actually have security.

09:32.447 --> 09:33.740
No. No, we don't.

09:33.823 --> 09:35.825
Are you familiar with Kodachrome?

09:37.243 --> 09:40.038
Yes. Paul Simon, 1973.
What do you want to know?

09:40.121 --> 09:41.623
Not that. Kodachrome film.

09:41.706 --> 09:45.460
Your father shoots on Kodachrome. He
prefers his pictures to be projected...

09:45.543 --> 09:47.962
...with light rather than printed.
I know his spiel.

09:48.046 --> 09:51.716
There's only one place left in the world
that processes Kodachrome,

09:51.800 --> 09:54.010
and that's Dwayne's Photo
in Parsons, Kansas.

09:54.094 --> 09:56.346
But Kodak decided to
stop manufacturing the dyes,

09:56.429 --> 09:59.766
so after next week, it'll be impossible
to develop Kodachrome film.

09:59.849 --> 10:01.643
- Amazing.
- Your father found four rolls

10:01.726 --> 10:03.061
he shot a long time ago,

10:03.144 --> 10:06.272
and he never got them developed,
and it woke something up in him.

10:06.356 --> 10:08.983
He's decided he's going to have
one last show.

10:09.067 --> 10:10.652
How about that? Good for him, okay?

10:10.735 --> 10:13.196
This has been very, very... annoying.

10:13.279 --> 10:15.573
- Let me show you out.
- Can I just...

10:16.366 --> 10:19.744
Ben needs to get these rolls to Kansas,
and he can't fly in his condition.

10:19.828 --> 10:22.330
If only there was a service
that delivered overnight.

10:22.413 --> 10:25.083
- Yeah, well, he doesn't trust FedEx.
- Of course not.

10:25.291 --> 10:29.546
You're his nurse/assistant/whatever.
Don't you have a driver's license?

10:29.629 --> 10:31.381
- Yeah, I do.
- There you go.

10:31.464 --> 10:34.634
But Ben wants you to drive him.

10:36.761 --> 10:37.971
Hmm.

10:38.054 --> 10:41.015
I'm gonna try to explain this
as clearly as possible for you.

10:41.516 --> 10:44.102
I've not spoken to the man
in over a decade.

10:44.227 --> 10:47.730
There's no way in hell I'm going
to Kansas with him. Or anywhere.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.232
Come to dinner tonight.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.151
I know I'm talking. I can hear my voice.

10:51.234 --> 10:52.360
Matt!

10:53.653 --> 10:55.697
He's dying.

10:57.949 --> 11:00.785
You should go see him one last time.

11:08.501 --> 11:11.546
There'll be a car waiting for you
downstairs.

11:42.827 --> 11:46.331
Hey, Matt. Larry Holdt, Ben's manager.

11:46.664 --> 11:47.957
Yeah, I remember you.

11:48.625 --> 11:51.669
The last time I saw you,
you were still a teenager.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.422
That's great.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.176
Well, maybe we should get inside.

12:16.611 --> 12:17.820
He's in there.

12:24.994 --> 12:27.455
<i>♪ You're so good ♪</i>

12:29.832 --> 12:31.834
<i>♪ You get me high ♪</i>

12:33.294 --> 12:36.089
- <i>Hey!</i>
- <i>♪ You're so good for me ♪</i>

12:38.383 --> 12:40.385
<i>♪ You're so good for me ♪</i>

12:59.821 --> 13:01.406
I didn't think you'd come.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.162
Those look familiar.

13:09.247 --> 13:11.207
Well, they should. They're yours.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.793
You wanna bang it around a little?

13:14.627 --> 13:17.171
- No, I don't play anymore.
- That's too bad.

13:18.589 --> 13:20.633
'Cause you used to be pretty good.

13:40.945 --> 13:42.488
Oh, sorry for the smell.

13:43.948 --> 13:47.285
You know, the meds they give me
give me gas.

14:16.731 --> 14:17.690
So, Matt...

14:18.691 --> 14:22.278
Larry tells me things haven't been going
so well for you at the record label.

14:23.029 --> 14:28.159
I was telling Ben that record labels can't
find a sustainable business model.

14:28.242 --> 14:31.454
You told me that he was gonna be
out on his ass any day now.

14:31.537 --> 14:32.663
Jesus, Ben.

14:32.747 --> 14:35.249
- Where'd you hear that?
- Larry knows everything.

14:35.333 --> 14:38.086
- Behave.
- I'm dyin'. I don't have time to behave.

14:38.878 --> 14:42.799
Come on. That's bullshit.
You were a prick long before cancer.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.093
That's true enough.

14:46.469 --> 14:48.805
At least you two are talking.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.139
This is good.

14:53.434 --> 14:55.478
So how much time you got left?

14:57.855 --> 15:00.108
Depends on which doctor you talk to.

15:00.441 --> 15:02.443
I'm betting tits up by New Year's.

15:04.278 --> 15:08.616
Why did you get divorced? She catch you
in flagrante with some other babe?

15:10.034 --> 15:12.203
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?
- You catch her?

15:12.286 --> 15:15.248
Because you fucked around on Mom
doesn't mean everyone does.

15:15.331 --> 15:16.624
Pace yourselves.

15:16.707 --> 15:19.085
Your mother and I had
a complicated relationship.

15:19.168 --> 15:22.004
Complicated by you putting your dick
in every woman you met.

15:22.130 --> 15:23.840
Your mother forgave me.

15:24.382 --> 15:27.427
- Yeah. Well, she died alone, Ben.
- So will I.

15:27.552 --> 15:29.512
- Yeah, but you deserve to.
- Hey.

15:34.350 --> 15:37.728
It's okay.
We're just... just catching up here.

15:37.812 --> 15:39.981
- People change.
- No, they don't.

15:41.399 --> 15:43.359
Why don't we talk about the trip?

15:43.443 --> 15:47.405
I can save us all a lot of trouble here.
I'm not going on any trip.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.702
You are a desperate old man.

15:53.953 --> 15:57.165
Tryin' to what?
Manufacture some bullshit redemption?

15:58.416 --> 15:59.584
Why?

15:59.667 --> 16:05.173
So you can pretend your empty, selfish
life was anything but meaningless?

16:07.008 --> 16:08.342
Thanks, but no thanks.

16:09.427 --> 16:13.973
Just so you know, when you are dead,
no one's gonna care that you're gone.

16:14.640 --> 16:17.351
I mean, maybe these two,
but you pay for them.

16:48.216 --> 16:50.676
- Hello?
- Matt, Larry Holdt.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.220
- Hey, Larry.
- <i>I want to discuss...</i>

17:03.022 --> 17:04.440
Come on, man.

17:06.526 --> 17:07.734
<i>Matt, don't hang up.</i>

17:07.818 --> 17:09.779
- Not gonna change my mind, Larry.
- <i>I know.</i>

17:09.862 --> 17:12.949
- <i>I'm gonna change it for you.</i>
- Oh, you are? Really? How?

17:13.031 --> 17:15.701
<i>Spare Sevens. I can get you a sit-down.</i>

17:18.454 --> 17:20.998
- Go on.
- <i>Their manager used to work for me.</i>

17:21.915 --> 17:24.377
<i>He says you've been calling all day.</i>

17:24.460 --> 17:28.548
They're going to be playing in Chicago
in a few days. Some radio station thing.

17:28.631 --> 17:30.550
<i>You can swing by on your way.</i>

17:30.675 --> 17:33.177
Wait. Hold on.
What do you mean on my way?

17:33.553 --> 17:35.555
You're talking about Kansas, yeah?

17:35.930 --> 17:38.307
Look. I don't know
how to make this any more clear.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.309
That's just not going to happen.

17:40.393 --> 17:43.479
Look. Ben needs the show,
and you need that meeting

17:44.063 --> 17:47.275
<i>And trust me.
This is the only way you'll get it.</i>

17:50.111 --> 17:52.363
I'm not going to go with him, Larry.

17:53.739 --> 17:55.241
It's not happening.

17:55.741 --> 17:57.493
Please, don't call back.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.682
Fuck.

18:38.409 --> 18:40.953
Good morning, Matthew.
Glad you reconsidered.

18:42.330 --> 18:44.040
So what's up with the Sevens?

18:44.123 --> 18:45.416
Show's Saturday.

18:46.542 --> 18:48.794
I'll make arrangements
for a meeting afterwards.

18:49.378 --> 18:50.796
Mm-hmm.

18:52.632 --> 18:55.384
Still drive that, huh?
You fix the roof yet?

18:55.468 --> 18:57.720
I'm sorry.
Would you like to take your car?

18:58.346 --> 19:01.015
- I don't have a car.
- Then that settles that.

19:01.098 --> 19:03.017
The car runs fine, Matt.

19:03.851 --> 19:07.563
- You're going too, huh?
- Unless you want to give me my shots.

19:07.647 --> 19:10.566
- Is that okay with you?
- Fine with me.

19:12.401 --> 19:15.780
- All right.
- Let's go! We're burning daylight.

19:17.531 --> 19:20.993
<i>In two miles, merge onto I-80 West.</i>

19:21.077 --> 19:22.787
Do not text and drive, please.

19:22.870 --> 19:26.707
I'm not texting. I'm looking at texts.
There's a difference.

19:26.832 --> 19:30.211
Hey, this car doesn't have an iPhone jack
or anything like that, does it?

19:30.336 --> 19:34.423
We're strictly analog here.
Some cassettes in the glove compartment.

19:35.132 --> 19:39.804
<i>In 1.5 miles, stay
to the right to merge onto I-80 West.</i>

19:39.887 --> 19:42.348
Zooey, hand me that thing for a second,
will you?

19:42.431 --> 19:44.225
Yeah.

19:48.187 --> 19:52.066
- What the hell are you doing?
- Like I said, strictly analog.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.443
We gotta drive halfway
across the country.

19:54.527 --> 19:57.863
That's right. I'm not gonna have
some robot bitch whinin' in my ear,

19:57.947 --> 20:00.533
sending me on some sterile interstate.

20:00.616 --> 20:04.578
We have a week to get to Kansas.
We're taking the scenic route.

20:05.246 --> 20:07.206
We're going to use this map here.

20:07.707 --> 20:10.835
- Remember what a map is?
- Yeah. I know what a map is.

20:14.088 --> 20:15.798
- Turn that up, will you, Zo?
- Yeah.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.383
Love this song.

20:17.466 --> 20:23.472
<i>♪ You've already burned it down ♪</i>

20:25.141 --> 20:27.393
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

20:54.211 --> 20:55.337
Ben, you're here.

21:04.555 --> 21:08.309
There's a diner across the street.
We should meet up later and grab dinner.

21:08.476 --> 21:10.436
That sounds like a plan.

21:11.228 --> 21:12.646
Yeah, you guys go ahead.

21:13.063 --> 21:16.776
I'm just gonna get in a quick workout,
make it an early night.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.370
Hey.

21:29.997 --> 21:31.791
Don't give me that look.

21:31.874 --> 21:35.669
Okay. You know what?
You need to let your guard down.

21:37.171 --> 21:40.174
- Excuse me?
- Yeah. I know you're scared.

21:40.257 --> 21:42.134
Scared? What am I scared of exactly?

21:42.218 --> 21:44.220
You're scared to open yourself up to him.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.806
You're scared to let yourself
love him again.

21:48.265 --> 21:49.683
- Wow.
- Don't.

21:49.767 --> 21:52.228
- Wow, that's amazing.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

21:52.353 --> 21:55.898
Yeah, I mean forget therapy
or the facts of my relationship with him,

21:55.981 --> 21:59.276
you spend six hours in a car with me,
and you've cracked the code.

21:59.360 --> 22:02.154
- You don't have to be a dick.
- No, I don't need to be a dick.

22:02.238 --> 22:05.074
I need to be...
less scared to let him in.

22:05.699 --> 22:06.992
Or let him into...

22:07.409 --> 22:09.870
- I'm just saying...
- I'll mull it over.

22:09.954 --> 22:11.622
You made the effort to come.

22:11.705 --> 22:14.959
You may as well
try and get to know him a little bit.

22:15.042 --> 22:16.335
Watch your fingers.

23:49.136 --> 23:53.515
and I was in the White House doing
a spread on Clinton at Bill's request.

23:53.891 --> 23:57.519
It was right after the whole, you know,
bullshit impeachment circus.

23:57.603 --> 23:58.896
Bill was trying to prove...

23:58.979 --> 24:01.065
You're calling
the Lewinsky scandal bullshit?

24:01.148 --> 24:04.193
He cheated on his wife
and lied to the entire country about it.

24:04.276 --> 24:07.404
They all cheat. They all fuck around.
You should know that.

24:07.529 --> 24:10.157
- Ben.
- What? After the way your marriage ended?

24:10.240 --> 24:12.326
- You're seriously gonna sit here and...
- Stop.

24:12.409 --> 24:16.163
What? Just because Matt's here.
Don't be an idiot.

24:16.246 --> 24:20.501
- If anybody knows about fuckin' around...
- Hey, you need to stop talking now.

24:21.335 --> 24:23.671
- Leave her alone, okay?
- It's fine.

24:25.047 --> 24:27.091
I do believe Matt here's defending you.

24:27.633 --> 24:31.303
Just go back to your bullshit stories
about you and your fancy friends.

24:31.387 --> 24:33.806
What we're seeing now is jealousy.

24:34.431 --> 24:39.728
Envy and resentment of a man living in the
shadow of his father's accomplishments.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.815
Yeah, you've had a great big life.

24:43.357 --> 24:45.484
- Yeah. You're damn straight I did.
- Mm-hmm.

24:47.111 --> 24:49.238
Where are all those friends
while you're dying?

24:49.321 --> 24:50.197
- Matt.
- Alone?

24:50.280 --> 24:51.323
Stop.

24:51.407 --> 24:56.161
My work will live on long after I'm gone.
What have you done?

25:02.668 --> 25:06.880
Holy shit. Look at that, man.
She's gotta be 250 pounds or something.

25:07.172 --> 25:08.799
That outfit's beautiful.

25:12.261 --> 25:14.388
Can you just try and take it easy on him?

25:14.471 --> 25:17.057
Me? Are you kidding me?
I was defending you.

25:17.141 --> 25:23.814
You know, a month from now, two months,
he's going to be gone forever.

25:23.897 --> 25:26.567
No, I get it, okay?
I understand the concept.

25:26.650 --> 25:29.862
It doesn't give him a free pass
to be an asshole to people.

25:32.156 --> 25:34.575
'Kay.

25:35.034 --> 25:37.077
I'm going to go back to the motel.

25:41.957 --> 25:43.542
Boy.

25:44.084 --> 25:46.462
- Fucking...

What? What's funny?

27:09.545 --> 27:11.004
Uh...

27:12.297 --> 27:16.176
When I was a kid,
my mom used to take me up to the Poconos

27:16.260 --> 27:18.137
for a few weeks every summer.

27:18.220 --> 27:22.391
After we'd pass a few of those
deer crossing signs that just went by,

27:23.642 --> 27:25.102
I remember I asked her,

27:26.186 --> 27:30.983
"Mom, how do the deers know
that's where they're supposed to cross?"

27:32.442 --> 27:34.403
I was being serious. I was a kid.

27:34.820 --> 27:39.950
But she just laughed her ass off like
it was the funniest thing she ever heard.

27:40.742 --> 27:42.286
That felt great, 'cause...

27:43.954 --> 27:46.248
I don't remember her laughing much.

27:50.085 --> 27:51.336
When did she die?

27:54.381 --> 27:55.674
I...

27:57.759 --> 27:59.511
When I was 13.

28:02.639 --> 28:04.725
I'm so sorry.

28:08.520 --> 28:13.692
After that I moved out of New York to
live with my aunt and uncle in Cleveland.

28:15.152 --> 28:18.530
Ben was...
He was working in Africa at the time.

28:20.532 --> 28:23.202
He didn't even make it back
for the funeral.

28:23.327 --> 28:25.579
There was a civil war going on.

28:25.662 --> 28:26.914
Mm-hmm.

28:26.997 --> 28:29.499
I'm not making excuses. I'm just...

28:30.584 --> 28:34.796
saying if you think you had it rough,
just spend some time and effort.

28:34.922 --> 28:36.757
I'll remember that.

28:40.594 --> 28:42.221
We should go see him.

28:43.055 --> 28:43.889
Go see who?

28:44.556 --> 28:47.768
Your Uncle Dean.
Cleveland's only an hour away,

28:47.851 --> 28:51.355
and your "Spare Sister's" thing
isn't until tomorrow night.

28:52.231 --> 28:54.358
I wouldn't mind seeing my brother...

28:55.234 --> 28:58.070
one more time before I leave this planet.

28:59.154 --> 29:00.447
Yeah, but...

29:01.031 --> 29:02.741
Dean hates you.

29:03.951 --> 29:06.787
He doesn't hate me.
He's just pissed off at me.

Yes, I am

29:53.667 --> 29:55.168
It's good to see you

29:57.129 --> 30:00.882
- Matt, what are you doin' here?
- Hi. That is a long story.

30:00.966 --> 30:02.092
Yeah, I bet.

30:02.759 --> 30:05.053
- And who's this?
- This is Zooey.

30:05.137 --> 30:06.930

- Is that Matty?

30:07.014 --> 30:08.140
Nice to meet you.

30:08.223 --> 30:09.641
- Hi!
- Hey.

30:11.560 --> 30:12.728
Ben.

30:13.228 --> 30:15.856
- Hi, Sarah.
- He's dying.

30:16.106 --> 30:19.026
Well, not in our driveway, he isn't.
Bring him on in.

30:19.109 --> 30:22.154
And you!
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

30:22.237 --> 30:24.031
Sorry. It was a last-minute thing.

30:24.114 --> 30:26.700
- Hey! Hi!
- This is Zooey.

30:26.783 --> 30:29.828
Oh, Matty. Well, now she's more like it.

30:29.911 --> 30:32.414
I mean,
I told him not to marry the other one.

30:32.497 --> 30:36.084
- No, I, um...
- Zooey is Ben's nurse.

30:37.336 --> 30:40.255
Oh, because your auras are conjoined.

30:40.339 --> 30:43.175
- I could see that immediately
- Yeah. Yeah.

30:43.425 --> 30:46.511
Aunt Sarah here can see auras.

30:46.595 --> 30:49.014
- And she can hear sarcasm.
- Of course she can.

30:49.097 --> 30:51.600
- You guys are gonna spend the night?
- If that's okay.

30:51.683 --> 30:53.894
Great.
Matty, you and Zooey take your old room.

30:53.977 --> 30:56.063
- But we are... not together.
- Nope.

31:08.450 --> 31:09.451
Hi.

31:10.577 --> 31:12.371
- Hey.
- This was your room.

31:12.454 --> 31:16.750
Yeah. Basically, seventh, eighth grade
through high school.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.211
God, you were really into music.

31:19.711 --> 31:24.466
Yep. They say it's the one thing
I inherited from Ben.

31:26.927 --> 31:31.640
Actually, I would say that
the only memories, or good ones,

31:31.723 --> 31:35.185
at least, that I have of him
were listening to music.

31:35.268 --> 31:39.189
We had this little den
and this old Fisher stereo.

31:39.314 --> 31:41.358
I mean, new at the time, but...

31:41.441 --> 31:44.528
He'd let me play records
when he was goin' through the slides.

31:44.611 --> 31:45.612
Mm-hmm.

31:45.695 --> 31:49.074
So, while most kids had people
singin' 'em lullabies to sleep,

31:49.157 --> 31:52.494
I had Graham Nash singing "Wounded Bird."

31:53.453 --> 31:55.330
Let's see what we have here.

31:55.622 --> 31:59.459
Ooh! Pearl Jam. Radiohead.

31:59.543 --> 32:02.629
- Nirvana.
- What can I say? I was a moody kid.

32:02.712 --> 32:06.466
Yeah, you can tell a lot about someone's
past from the music they listened to.

32:07.384 --> 32:09.928
Then I guess you know a lot about
my past now.

32:10.846 --> 32:12.931
What do you think I listened to?

32:15.851 --> 32:19.938
Very interesting question.
Okay, I'll bite.

32:20.814 --> 32:23.358
But in order to do this
to the best of my ability,

32:23.442 --> 32:26.570
I have to actually figure out
your exact age, so... excuse this.

32:26.653 --> 32:30.073
This might be a little rude.
What are you? Twenty-eight?

32:30.699 --> 32:31.867
- I'm 30.
- You are?

32:31.950 --> 32:32.826
- Yeah.
- Hey.

32:32.909 --> 32:34.786
- Thank you.
- Dodged a bullet there.

32:35.996 --> 32:39.916
So that means you were
a freshman in college, like, in 2000.

32:40.625 --> 32:43.503
So then you were into...

32:44.171 --> 32:47.048
Sorry to say, but you're a product
of your environment. Top 40.

32:47.132 --> 32:50.510
I'm talking Britney, Christina,
boy bands, N'SYNC, Backstreet Boys,

32:50.594 --> 32:52.345
maybe Alanis when you're feeling dark.

32:52.429 --> 32:54.473
- Please give me some credit.
- But then...

32:54.556 --> 32:57.893
But then you started to rebel against
your middle-class suburban values.

32:57.976 --> 33:00.145
- Is that what I was doing?
- Mm-hmm.

33:00.228 --> 33:03.190
Or possibly
you met a guy into alternative music.

33:03.273 --> 33:07.569
Why do you assume that I changed
for a guy? Maybe he changed for me.

33:07.652 --> 33:11.364
No, no. Guys don't change for girls.
Not in college at least.

33:11.615 --> 33:13.950
- When do they change then?
- Much later.

33:15.494 --> 33:17.120
Usually when it's too late.

33:18.538 --> 33:21.666
You started to listen to bands
you thought would make you edgier,

33:21.750 --> 33:24.419
but you're still hopelessly mainstream.

33:24.503 --> 33:27.881
You're sittin' there in your dorm room,
and you're listening to...

33:29.216 --> 33:30.175
Live.

33:32.219 --> 33:34.137
Like who live? What live?

33:34.221 --> 33:37.557
- No, the band, "Live."
- I don't know of a band called Live.

33:37.641 --> 33:39.059
Live. You know. Like...

33:39.142 --> 33:40.519
<i>♪ I alone want you ♪</i>

33:40.602 --> 33:44.064
I actually could not name a single song
that the band Live had.

33:44.147 --> 33:46.733
What about "Lightning Crashes"?
Everyone knows that.

33:46.858 --> 33:48.610
<i>♪ Her placenta falls to the floor ♪</i>

33:48.735 --> 33:50.403
- Oh, my God!
- What?

33:50.487 --> 33:53.990
People know it because it's the only
pop song with the word "placenta" in it.

33:54.074 --> 33:57.869
You're really bad at this.
I was a weird, sad punk.

33:57.953 --> 34:00.413
- It was the Smiths, Pixies.
- But you loved Live.

34:00.497 --> 34:03.583
- Yeah, I loved Live.
- Biggest fan. Live's biggest fan.

34:03.667 --> 34:04.876
No, I'm not wrong.

34:05.794 --> 34:07.671
- This isn't bad.
- What?

34:07.754 --> 34:09.755
- Galaxie 500.
- Oh, yeah.

34:09.839 --> 34:11.424
- Obscure.
- Indeed.

34:11.507 --> 34:14.469
- Does your record player still work?
- Fucking better.

34:14.886 --> 34:17.013
Let's take it for a spin.

34:24.646 --> 34:28.984
<i>♪ My head will turn to yellow ♪</i>

34:29.400 --> 34:34.697
<i>♪ My eyes will turn to green ♪</i>

34:35.907 --> 34:40.245
<i>♪ My voice will turn to mellow ♪</i>

34:40.328 --> 34:46.333
<i>♪ But still I can't be seen ♪</i>

34:47.877 --> 34:52.382
<i>♪ Melt away ♪</i>

34:52.465 --> 34:57.596
<i>♪ I want to melt away ♪</i>

34:59.222 --> 35:03.685
<i>♪ Melt away ♪</i>

35:03.768 --> 35:09.149
<i>♪ I want to melt away ♪</i>

35:13.778 --> 35:17.032
How is Hank? Is he married?
Is Hank married yet?

35:17.115 --> 35:19.159
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Couple of years now.

35:19.242 --> 35:21.703
- Have any kids?
- Not yet, but...

35:21.786 --> 35:24.706
You know, they're so young.
There's no rush.

35:26.124 --> 35:28.710
So what's so special about
these photographs

35:28.793 --> 35:32.130
you need to drive halfway
across the country to get them developed?

35:32.213 --> 35:34.382
It's some of my early work.

35:34.466 --> 35:35.842
Stuff I shot years ago.

35:36.593 --> 35:39.054
What happens if you get 'em back,
and they're garbage?

35:39.137 --> 35:40.805
How do you even know what's on them?

35:40.889 --> 35:43.266
I remember every shot I've ever taken.

35:44.184 --> 35:47.020
That's, like,
hundreds of thousands of photos.

35:47.145 --> 35:49.773
- You remember all of them?
- Yep.

35:50.315 --> 35:51.983
That's impressive.

35:53.818 --> 35:55.320
When's my birthday?

36:03.828 --> 36:06.539
- February 19.
- February 19.

36:07.165 --> 36:09.626
You got it. Yeah.

36:21.137 --> 36:23.056
- Last one.
- Thanks.

36:23.139 --> 36:25.684
It's good to see them together again.

36:27.352 --> 36:29.354
It's good to see you with him.

36:31.815 --> 36:34.484
I don't know. He left us.

36:35.568 --> 36:37.445
Hell, he left you guys too.

36:38.530 --> 36:42.617
Now he's dying, so he comes back,
and we're just lettin' him back in.

36:44.035 --> 36:46.287
It's like he's getting away with it.

36:46.413 --> 36:47.872
Matty, look at him.

36:49.082 --> 36:52.627
I mean, does that look like a man
who's gotten away with anything?

36:57.340 --> 36:58.842
Mmm.

36:58.967 --> 37:00.218
Okay, I'm gonna...

37:01.553 --> 37:02.887
I'm gonna go upstairs.

37:03.263 --> 37:05.724
Try and get a little work done
before I pass out.

37:08.226 --> 37:11.479
Can I take this, put wine it,
and drink it in my room?

37:11.563 --> 37:13.273
- Help yourself.
- All right.

37:13.690 --> 37:15.567
- 'Night, sweetheart.
- 'Night.

37:15.859 --> 37:17.444
- I'm so glad you're here.
- Me too.

37:17.527 --> 37:19.404
- I love you.
- Love you too.

37:23.616 --> 37:26.369
Hey, guys. I'm going to bed.
I'll see you in the morning.

37:26.453 --> 37:28.163
- Okay.
- All right.

37:35.128 --> 37:37.338
- You good?
- Yeah.

37:37.422 --> 37:40.759
Yeah, no, I'm just a little tired.
Gonna get some work done.

37:41.718 --> 37:43.720
I'm glad you're making this trip.

37:44.721 --> 37:48.224
A man should know his father,
no matter what kind of bastard he is.

37:52.812 --> 37:54.814
You should come back here more often.

37:54.898 --> 37:58.693
- I know. I'm sorry.
- That's okay. End of the lecture.

37:58.777 --> 38:00.487
- It's good to see you.
- Thanks.

38:13.166 --> 38:14.292
Yep.

38:14.959 --> 38:16.878
- Hey, I saw...
- Hey.

38:17.128 --> 38:20.507
that your light was still on.
I got you a glass of water.

38:20.590 --> 38:21.591
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

38:21.674 --> 38:23.676
I know those guys can drink, so...

38:23.760 --> 38:26.054
Thought that might help
the cause in the morning.

38:26.137 --> 38:27.931
- How are you?
- Good.

38:28.223 --> 38:29.891
Is it hard being here?

38:31.893 --> 38:32.852
Um...

38:33.186 --> 38:35.772
- Sorry. Do you want to come in?
- Yeah.

38:37.315 --> 38:40.485
No. I mean, me, no.

38:41.319 --> 38:43.488
- Um, can I sit down?
- Yeah.

38:45.031 --> 38:48.243
Not weird for me. I guess
the weird thing would be...

38:50.203 --> 38:52.580
you know, seein' Ben here.

38:52.664 --> 38:55.041
Is a little, you know, odd.

39:02.090 --> 39:03.007
Oh, um...

39:03.883 --> 39:06.511
Sarah... thinks you're beautiful.

39:09.013 --> 39:11.474
Okay. Cool.

39:15.436 --> 39:16.771
You are though.

39:18.940 --> 39:21.734
- I think you're drunk.
- No.

39:23.611 --> 39:26.656
Maybe. I might be, actually.

39:26.739 --> 39:29.284
But I'm not saying this 'cause I'm drunk.

39:29.367 --> 39:30.952
And I'm not gonna not say it

39:31.035 --> 39:33.997
'cause I think you'll think
I'm only saying it because I'm drunk.

39:34.497 --> 39:36.291
I don't know what we're talking about.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.376
- Oh, you didn't follow that?
- No.

39:38.543 --> 39:41.754
Then maybe I am drunk.
'Cause I followed it perfectly.

39:44.215 --> 39:46.759
Oh, this is a bad idea.

39:47.552 --> 39:49.721
- What? We're just talking.
- Yeah, well.

39:49.804 --> 39:55.310
Then you have to talk about the fact that
you're just talking and not just talking.

39:56.102 --> 39:57.061
Right.

40:02.609 --> 40:05.445
- Wait, I'm sorry. I mean...
- Oh! Whoa.

40:05.570 --> 40:08.448
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

40:09.032 --> 40:10.700
Holy shit.

40:10.783 --> 40:12.869
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

40:12.952 --> 40:14.203
I guess I deserved that.

40:16.623 --> 40:19.792
Thanks.

40:22.003 --> 40:25.632
- Oh, hey, close your eyes.
- Are you gonna get weird?

40:26.507 --> 40:29.135
No. No. Just close 'em.

40:29.802 --> 40:31.554
Okay. They're closed.

40:31.638 --> 40:33.348
Hold on a sec.

40:37.101 --> 40:38.770
Okay, you can open 'em now.

40:40.521 --> 40:42.982
Wow. That's really cool.

40:44.692 --> 40:47.654
Yeah, my cousin Hank
was really into astronomy.

40:47.904 --> 40:49.989
Yeah, I can tell.

40:57.121 --> 40:59.958
- What, um, Ben was saying...
- Mm-hmm.

41:00.625 --> 41:04.170
...last night at the diner
about your... ex-husband?

41:07.131 --> 41:09.884
Is that what happened? He cheated?

41:13.346 --> 41:17.225
Nothing good comes from reliving the past.
You know?

41:19.268 --> 41:21.646
You just sound like my ex-wife now.

41:24.315 --> 41:26.234
She used to say that I'd...

41:27.735 --> 41:32.490
I had a tendency to live in the past
rather than... embracing the present.

41:34.826 --> 41:36.411
Is that why she left you?

41:40.248 --> 41:42.917
It's never... one thing, now, is it?

41:44.585 --> 41:46.045
What about you?

41:46.421 --> 41:49.424
I don't know.
It all just happened so fucking fast.

41:49.507 --> 41:53.636
One moment we're just...
we're cruising and then...

41:55.847 --> 41:58.141
the next we're driving off a cliff.

42:00.143 --> 42:02.270
The funny thing is, I actually...

42:03.438 --> 42:07.233
For a moment there,
I thought I had it together, you know?

42:09.318 --> 42:11.988
I thought
I was someone to be reckoned with.

42:31.632 --> 42:34.343
Oh, my God, Ben. Jesus.

42:35.720 --> 42:40.058
- Help. Oh, God.
- Ben, what did you do? Are you okay?

42:40.141 --> 42:45.730
Yeah, yeah. I just...
I just got dizzy, and I tripped over...

42:46.355 --> 42:48.858
the corner over here.
I was gonna take a shower.

42:48.941 --> 42:52.820
Wait for me before you do that.
Can you move your fingers? Toes?

42:53.154 --> 42:54.781
- Yeah.
- Any dizziness or nausea?

42:56.574 --> 42:58.743
- Do you have any pain?
- No.

42:59.118 --> 43:00.578
Bend your leg for me.

43:00.661 --> 43:06.375
Wait. Stop gropin' me. Jesus Christ.
What are you doin'?

43:06.459 --> 43:08.669
I need to make sure
you don't have broken bones.

43:08.753 --> 43:10.671
- Help me up.
- I got you.

43:11.422 --> 43:14.717
- Here you go.
- Oh, God. Jesus Christ.

43:14.801 --> 43:17.011
- You don't feel pain anywhere?
- No.

43:17.095 --> 43:18.763
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

43:18.846 --> 43:20.848
- Oh, my God.
- I'm all right.

43:23.101 --> 43:27.271
I'm fine. I just need to sit here
for a couple minutes.

43:27.355 --> 43:28.898
- Okay.
- Yeah.

43:29.524 --> 43:32.902
- Thanks, baby.
- Oh, my God. Gave me a heart attack.

43:45.248 --> 43:47.458
- Hot coffee?
- Yes, please. Thank you.

43:47.542 --> 43:51.921
We should be able to get to Chicago
by late afternoon at the latest, yeah?

43:52.004 --> 43:56.134
That'll give us five days to get to Kansas
before the lab closes.

43:56.217 --> 43:57.426
Mm-hmm.

43:57.969 --> 44:00.304
So you two are screwing now.

44:02.849 --> 44:06.811
I mean, it makes sense.
He's low-hanging fruit sexually speaking.

44:07.520 --> 44:10.356
You haven't been laid in what?
Three years?

44:10.439 --> 44:13.776
- How about we shut up now, okay?
- You like your women damaged.

44:13.860 --> 44:17.738
- You like to damage yours.
- Okay, that's enough. Both of you.

44:22.952 --> 44:25.454
I didn't damage you. Did I, Sarah?

44:30.084 --> 44:32.795
- What's he talkin' about?
- Ben.

44:35.214 --> 44:38.134
- Sarah, what's he talking about?
- Nothing.

44:39.135 --> 44:43.014
A million years ago before
we went on our first date. Nothing.

44:43.097 --> 44:45.474
What? Did Sarah never mention that?

44:46.184 --> 44:50.354
I can understand why.
It wasn't really very memorable.

44:51.063 --> 44:55.693
Mostly just a lot of dry humping. Had
a couple drinks and couldn't quite get...

44:55.776 --> 44:56.819
Shut your mouth, Ben.

44:56.903 --> 45:00.740
Though God knows
she tried every trick in the book.

45:00.823 --> 45:02.200
- Shut up.
- Dean!

45:02.283 --> 45:07.330
What are you gonna do, Dean?
You gonna come over here and hit me?

45:11.250 --> 45:13.044
There's nothin' left to hit.

45:20.676 --> 45:23.346
Christ.

45:29.518 --> 45:32.188
- What is your fucking problem?
- Can we just calm down?

45:32.271 --> 45:35.650
I'm not gonna calm down.
Can't watch him shit all over my family.

45:35.733 --> 45:38.945
I'm just bustin' his balls
for Christ' sake. He's my kid brother.

45:40.238 --> 45:43.157
He was more of a father to me
than you ever were.

45:52.541 --> 45:54.835
I was just busting his balls.

45:57.255 --> 45:58.756
Drama.

46:43.551 --> 46:46.220
Doesn't anyone else
see how ridiculous it is?

46:47.722 --> 46:51.851
I mean, don't get me wrong.
You're a really good looking girl, Zooey.

46:51.934 --> 46:57.189
You're even sexy in a sloppy kind of way.
You got full lips, nice skin, great legs.

46:58.149 --> 47:01.277
And I guess, you know,
Matt's in decent enough shape.

47:01.736 --> 47:04.196
He's got no glaringly bad features.

47:04.280 --> 47:08.409
Judging by my own modest dimensions, I
doubt he's packing a python in his pants,

47:08.492 --> 47:11.370
but I'm sure it's
a perfectly adequate cock in a pinch.

47:11.454 --> 47:13.539
You're thrown together by circumstance.

47:13.622 --> 47:15.875
Neither one of you has demonstrated
any ability

47:15.958 --> 47:18.252
to sustain any kind of
meaningful relationship.

47:18.336 --> 47:23.632
To the contrary, you're both
especially dysfunctional in that regard.

47:23.716 --> 47:28.554
It's going to become very awkward
when this situation... goes south,

47:29.180 --> 47:30.514
and it will.

47:30.931 --> 47:32.975
- I mean, look at you.
- Shut up.

47:34.101 --> 47:36.020
Okay? Just shut up.

47:36.354 --> 47:37.897
Nothing happened.

47:39.857 --> 47:41.692
- Nothing happened?
- Nothing!

47:42.276 --> 47:43.861
You were alone in a room.

47:43.944 --> 47:45.321
- She's drunk.
- I wasn't drunk.

47:45.404 --> 47:47.073
- She's coming on to you.
- No.

47:47.156 --> 47:51.494
Every star in the sexual galaxy
is lined up. You couldn't seal the deal?

47:51.744 --> 47:54.372
What do you need?
Landing lights between her legs?

47:54.455 --> 47:55.915
- Thanks for that.
- Huh?

47:55.998 --> 47:59.085
- Thanks for that!
- Well, no offense. It's just...

47:59.877 --> 48:02.171
It's just disappointing. That's all.

48:02.963 --> 48:05.341
Well, really sorry to disappoint you.

48:05.925 --> 48:07.802
Are you ever happy, Ben?

48:07.885 --> 48:11.263
Let me tell you something.
Happiness is bullshit.

48:11.347 --> 48:13.432
It's the great myth
of the late 20th century.

48:13.516 --> 48:15.643
You think Picasso was happy?

48:15.726 --> 48:17.728
You think Hemingway was?

48:18.104 --> 48:20.398
Hendrix? They were miserable shits.

48:20.481 --> 48:24.944
No art worth a damn was ever created
out of happiness. I can tell you that.

48:25.528 --> 48:30.074
Ambition, narcissism, sex, rage.

48:30.157 --> 48:34.245
Those are the engines that drive
every great artist, every great man.

48:36.330 --> 48:38.374
A hole that can't be filled.

48:41.502 --> 48:43.963
That's why
we're all such miserable assholes.

48:44.672 --> 48:47.091
So you know you're a miserable asshole.

48:47.550 --> 48:50.678
What? Do you think I'm an idiot?
Of course I know.

48:53.931 --> 48:55.182
'Course I know.

You would have saved us all
a lot of trouble if you shot digital.

50:55.636 --> 50:58.347
You ever hold a pair of fake tits
in your hands?

50:58.430 --> 51:02.268
- What?
- No matter how good something looks,

51:03.769 --> 51:06.272
- you can't beat the real thing.
- Mm-hmm.

51:06.355 --> 51:10.192
People are taking more pictures now
than ever before.

51:10.776 --> 51:14.613
Billions of 'em.
But there's no slides, no prints.

51:15.155 --> 51:16.490
They're just data,

51:16.991 --> 51:18.826
electronic dust.

51:19.326 --> 51:23.622
Years from now, when they dig us up,
there won't be any pictures to find.

51:24.915 --> 51:29.086
No record of who we were, how we lived.

51:29.962 --> 51:33.924
What's the point of having an artifact
if you never see it with your own eyes?

51:36.427 --> 51:38.387
You still talking about film?

51:41.682 --> 51:43.559
Never mind.

51:43.642 --> 51:45.519
Hey, Matt, Matt.

51:48.439 --> 51:52.943
I don't kid myself that I was
any kind of husband or father.

51:54.320 --> 51:55.571
It's not about that.

51:59.408 --> 52:01.452
You just never saw me.

52:04.288 --> 52:05.581
Not once, Ben.

52:07.625 --> 52:11.337
I see for a living, Matt. It's what I do.

52:18.927 --> 52:20.846
We better get going.

52:51.251 --> 52:55.464
Hey, we just got to the hotel in Chicago.
Thanks for the passes for tonight.

52:55.547 --> 52:59.259
<i>I have you booked in St. Louis
tomorrow night, then Kansas City,</i>

52:59.343 --> 53:01.637
- <i>then Parsons for Tuesday.</i>
- Okay.

53:02.221 --> 53:05.140
<i>That gives you two extra days
before the lab closes.</i>

53:06.225 --> 53:09.728
Hey, look, Larry, I'd rather just go
straight from St. Louis to Parsons.

53:09.812 --> 53:12.439
I just want to drop off this film
and get back to my life.

53:12.523 --> 53:14.525
- If that's all right.
- <i>Suit yourself.</i>

53:14.608 --> 53:16.819
- <i>You ready for tonight?</i>
- Yeah, I'm ready.

53:16.902 --> 53:19.905
- Don't worry about me, Larry.
- <i>Good luck anyway.</i>

53:20.572 --> 53:21.990
Thanks, I guess.

53:45.806 --> 53:47.558
Uh-oh. Oh.

53:47.975 --> 53:50.936
- Okay.
- Go, Zooey.

53:56.400 --> 53:58.235
Oh, hey.

53:58.944 --> 54:02.656
Before I forget.
This is your pass for tonight.

54:03.157 --> 54:06.744
- This is the band you're pitchin'?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's them.

54:08.245 --> 54:11.081
Why don't you try
running your spiel by me?

54:11.832 --> 54:13.876
You know, kick the tires a little bit.

54:14.793 --> 54:16.754
No. No, I'm okay. Thanks though.

54:16.837 --> 54:21.133
Come on. I mean, you're asking
a successful band to leave a major label

54:21.216 --> 54:23.218
and trust you at a boutique.

54:23.719 --> 54:24.845
Let's hear it.

54:26.847 --> 54:30.100
Come on. Just give me your pitch.
It's good practice.

54:30.184 --> 54:32.853
I mean, your career depends on it, right?

54:35.647 --> 54:36.815
Okay.

54:38.317 --> 54:39.985
We're not corporate.

54:40.068 --> 54:43.572
We're not part of a conglomerate
that only worries about the bottom line.

54:43.655 --> 54:47.242
We actually are a company that still
believes the artist is visionary,

54:47.326 --> 54:48.994
not just a product.

54:50.245 --> 54:52.956
Yeah, don't say any of that.
You sound like a pussy.

54:53.040 --> 54:54.458
Never mind. Bad idea.

54:54.541 --> 54:56.960
You were always a little timid,
even as a little kid.

54:57.044 --> 54:59.838
You have any idea how condescending
and insulting you can be?

54:59.922 --> 55:02.049
Just listen to me?
These guys are surrounded

55:02.132 --> 55:05.093
by people tellin' 'em
how great they are all the time.

55:05.177 --> 55:07.513
They need that because they're artists.

55:07.596 --> 55:10.224
We're all just
a bunch of insecure bastards.

55:10.307 --> 55:12.476
So you don't tell them how great they are,

55:12.559 --> 55:15.020
you tell 'em
what you don't like about 'em.

55:15.103 --> 55:18.607
Speak with authority.
Not only will they respect you,

55:18.690 --> 55:21.985
but they'll believe
you're the only guy who can fix it.

55:27.741 --> 55:30.661
- Why'd you come on this trip?
- What?

55:30.744 --> 55:33.831
Don't tell me it's about
this "Seven Sisters" or whoever.

55:33.914 --> 55:36.708
Spare Sevens. Yeah, no. That's why.

55:42.256 --> 55:44.967
And I guess there's part of me

55:45.050 --> 55:48.178
that figured this was the last chance
I'd have to see you

55:48.262 --> 55:52.349
and how you measure up against
the bastard I've hated all these years.

55:53.725 --> 55:55.227
How am I doing?

55:56.812 --> 55:58.146
You're holding your own.

56:00.941 --> 56:02.860
You wanna know the sad part?

56:04.820 --> 56:06.697
I've actually been trying.

- What?
- I think they're good.

56:38.937 --> 56:41.940
I think
they could use a new record label though.

56:42.316 --> 56:43.525
I agree.

So... what I was talkin' about earlier...

57:05.130 --> 57:07.758
Thanks.

57:07.883 --> 57:12.304
- Sorry. Matt, Matt. What were you saying?
- We're talking about creative control

57:12.387 --> 57:15.057
and support
you're not going to find anywhere else.

57:15.140 --> 57:17.768
I just don't think you should be singin'
for your supper.

57:18.518 --> 57:21.480
We want to give you the space
to record the album

57:21.563 --> 57:23.774
that the whole world is waiting for.

57:24.983 --> 57:26.818
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

57:26.902 --> 57:28.862
But, um...

57:29.696 --> 57:33.617
I'm going to do that no matter where I am,
aren't I?

57:36.244 --> 57:40.207
Yes, no, of course,
but what we're offering is...

57:40.290 --> 57:44.002
Matt,
you've worked with some serious bands.

57:44.836 --> 57:47.422
And some shit bands if I'm being honest.

57:47.631 --> 57:50.092
A bit of this, a bit of that.

57:50.717 --> 57:52.803
We're on a streak now.

57:53.595 --> 57:56.473
Selling out shows, heavy rotation.

57:58.725 --> 58:00.769
If it ain't broke, and all that.

58:01.645 --> 58:03.438
- Right?
- Yeah. No. I, um...

58:04.606 --> 58:06.525
I hear what you're saying.

58:10.320 --> 58:11.571
Matt.

58:16.034 --> 58:17.744
But it is broke, Jasper.

58:19.246 --> 58:20.998
You just don't know it yet.

58:21.832 --> 58:24.626
Or my hunch is... that maybe you do.

58:25.293 --> 58:27.671
You did agree to meet with me
tonight, right?

58:28.547 --> 58:29.798
- Yes or no?
- Yes.

58:29.881 --> 58:32.384
Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Well done.

58:32.467 --> 58:35.345
So you were honest with me.
I'm gonna be honest with you.

58:36.013 --> 58:37.889
I loved your guys' first record.

58:38.890 --> 58:39.850
It was amazing.

58:40.434 --> 58:43.020
Deserves every bit of recognition
that it got.

58:43.103 --> 58:45.313
I worked out to it. I fucked to it.

58:45.397 --> 58:47.733
It helped me get through my divorce.

58:48.442 --> 58:50.360
Seriously. It's one of those.

58:50.652 --> 58:52.612
It was incredible. Because it had balls.

58:52.696 --> 58:55.449
It was unique. It was original.
It was yours.

58:56.825 --> 58:59.244
Your second album, however, <i>Alibi.</i>

59:00.454 --> 59:03.832
Ironically named, if you ask me,
'cause that thing is anything...

59:05.250 --> 59:06.293
but your first album.

59:06.376 --> 59:08.086
It is at best forgettable.

59:09.254 --> 59:12.299
Teenagers make that music
with a fucking laptop.

59:13.759 --> 59:15.177
They do.

59:15.635 --> 59:18.680
I don't know whose idea it was
to put that dance track on there,

59:18.764 --> 59:21.850
but I bet it wasn't any of you guys,
am I wrong?

59:22.100 --> 59:24.686
You don't look at each other
when you play the new songs.

59:24.770 --> 59:28.065
You just look out straight forward,
scanning the crowd for girls.

59:29.816 --> 59:32.861
- You're embarrassed. I don't blame you.
- What's your point?

59:32.944 --> 59:35.489
I think you're better than that.
That's all I'm saying.

59:35.572 --> 59:37.491
'Cause you're an actual
fucking rock band.

59:38.116 --> 59:40.702
Drums, guitar, bass, vocals.

59:41.369 --> 59:43.789
Then you add all this other shit
you don't need.

59:44.331 --> 59:46.416
You're selling albums, but to who?

59:46.500 --> 59:48.960
People that pay attention
to fuckin' commercials.

59:50.545 --> 59:53.799
I want you guys
to get back to what you do.

59:53.882 --> 59:57.052
To reclaim what made
the Spare Sevens the Spare Sevens.

59:57.135 --> 01:00:00.430
If you don't, you're just going to
be another casualty of the machine.

01:00:01.348 --> 01:00:04.768
If I didn't believe this, if I didn't
believe in you, I wouldn't be here.

01:00:06.144 --> 01:00:09.439
You have no fucking idea
what it took me to get here.

01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:21.785
Fuck.

01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:23.245
Fuck, man.

01:00:28.667 --> 01:00:32.003
You've got a massive pair of balls on you,
don't you?

01:00:32.504 --> 01:00:33.421
Yeah.

01:00:33.839 --> 01:00:37.551
They make my dick look really small.

01:00:43.265 --> 01:00:46.017
Okay, man.

01:00:48.186 --> 01:00:49.312
Okay.

01:00:50.522 --> 01:00:52.315
How do you see this working?

01:00:52.941 --> 01:00:55.026
Glad you asked.

01:00:55.152 --> 01:00:58.280
- I have to take a look at your contract.
- This geezer pissed himself.

01:00:59.114 --> 01:01:01.074
This geezer pissed his pants!

01:01:04.953 --> 01:01:09.249
Get the old codger a nappy.
Get him a diaper!

01:01:10.625 --> 01:01:11.751
Shit!

01:01:11.835 --> 01:01:13.837
Fucking hope not.

01:01:15.463 --> 01:01:17.048
Get him out.

01:01:18.216 --> 01:01:20.385
I don't even know what happened.

01:01:20.719 --> 01:01:23.346
Sorry. Sorry, Matt.

01:01:24.014 --> 01:01:25.557
What were you sayin'?

01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:28.602
Matt?

01:01:29.644 --> 01:01:31.021
Um...

01:01:33.732 --> 01:01:38.278
You guys are newly famous, so by default
you're going to be assholes.

01:01:38.695 --> 01:01:39.613
What?

01:01:39.696 --> 01:01:43.909
The sad thing is there's a big part of me
that would still love to sign you.

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:50.540
But I can't even pretend
to have anywhere...

01:01:52.417 --> 01:01:55.128
close to some type of respect
for any of you.

01:01:56.046 --> 01:01:57.380
Um...

01:01:59.424 --> 01:02:03.261
You know what? Thank you for the beer.

01:02:03.845 --> 01:02:05.263
And good luck.

01:02:06.056 --> 01:02:07.140
Matt.

01:02:46.221 --> 01:02:47.097
I got it.

01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:51.142
Here. Keep the change.

01:02:53.019 --> 01:02:54.479
You're welcome.

01:02:57.023 --> 01:02:59.150
I'll see you guys in a little bit,
all right?

01:02:59.234 --> 01:03:02.696
- Where are you goin'?
- Just gonna take a few moments

01:03:02.779 --> 01:03:04.281
to collect my thoughts.

01:03:04.656 --> 01:03:07.701
By that, I mean I'm gonna
get fucked up across the street.

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:14.082
- Well, that was something, huh?
- That was stupid.

01:03:15.917 --> 01:03:18.420
What? He should have closed the deal.

01:03:18.753 --> 01:03:20.755
He was defending you.

01:03:20.839 --> 01:03:22.966
Don't put this on me. It wasn't my fault.

01:03:23.049 --> 01:03:25.677
- That's not the point.
- I'm standing here in my own piss.

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:28.013
Maybe you could
try to get to the goddamn point.

01:03:28.096 --> 01:03:31.349
The point is, you're gonna thank him
tonight, and you're gonna mean it.

01:03:31.433 --> 01:03:32.517
Uh-huh.

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:34.477
Ben. Ben!

01:03:38.148 --> 01:03:41.151
I... I can't do this anymore.

01:03:44.029 --> 01:03:46.239
I love you, and you know that but...

01:03:47.157 --> 01:03:50.035
you don't make it easy.
You make it virtually impossible.

01:03:50.118 --> 01:03:53.204
But Matt, he's here for you.
It doesn't matter what he says.

01:03:53.288 --> 01:03:57.042
He... He came on this trip for you.

01:03:57.834 --> 01:04:02.422
You have done nothing to earn his love,
but tonight he gave it to you anyway.

01:04:02.505 --> 01:04:07.469
And he did that for you,
and if you can't find it in yourself

01:04:07.552 --> 01:04:11.014
to show your son.
Just, like, an ounce of kindness,

01:04:11.097 --> 01:04:15.060
then I... I can't...
I'm done defending you.

01:04:15.143 --> 01:04:16.478
I can't be your nurse.

01:04:18.146 --> 01:04:20.065
I don't know how to help you.

01:04:23.735 --> 01:04:25.070
Are you done?

01:04:26.946 --> 01:04:27.947
Yeah.

01:04:30.408 --> 01:04:31.409
Okay.

01:04:34.829 --> 01:04:38.249
- What does that mean? "Okay."
- You're fired.

01:04:59.854 --> 01:05:01.272
Is someone sitting here?

01:05:05.527 --> 01:05:06.528
No.

01:05:11.616 --> 01:05:12.617
How's he doing?

01:05:13.201 --> 01:05:16.413
He's overcome with gratitude.

01:05:18.498 --> 01:05:21.334
- Really?
- No. Mm-mmm.

01:05:21.501 --> 01:05:23.169
Nope. I need a drink.

01:05:24.045 --> 01:05:24.879
Hey,

01:05:24.963 --> 01:05:31.094
can I please get, like,
any semi-decent reposado on ice, please?

01:05:31.928 --> 01:05:35.056
- Let me ask you something. You were there.
- Mm-hmm.

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:38.726
It was happening, right?
Like before I had my little freak out?

01:05:38.810 --> 01:05:41.980
- I had 'em, yeah?
- Yeah. You did.

01:05:44.023 --> 01:05:47.569
- So I really screwed myself. Okay.
- That's not how I see it.

01:05:49.821 --> 01:05:51.698
I appreciate that, but...

01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:55.702
I don't know if you realize
what kind of opportunities are out there

01:05:55.785 --> 01:05:57.328
for a guy like me at this point.

01:05:57.412 --> 01:05:59.038
Like, a handful?

01:05:59.539 --> 01:06:02.459
Mmm. Zero... is the right answer.

01:06:03.543 --> 01:06:07.046
Then, once word of this gets out,
it's gonna be even less.

01:06:11.342 --> 01:06:14.053
- The word is officially out.
- And are you fired?

01:06:14.262 --> 01:06:16.097
Uh, no. Not quite.

01:06:16.181 --> 01:06:18.516
Apparently I'm "fried."

01:06:19.058 --> 01:06:21.895
- Now I'm fired. There we go.
- Good.

01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:26.483
- Don't laugh. At least you got a job.
- Oh, no. I was actually just fired too.

01:06:27.901 --> 01:06:29.777
- You're joking.
- No. I'm not.

01:06:29.861 --> 01:06:34.115
- What? Why?
- It's fine. He does it a lot actually.

01:06:36.493 --> 01:06:38.828
- So, cheers to that.
- Cheers.

01:06:38.912 --> 01:06:40.538
- Cheers.
- Cheers. Here we go.

01:06:44.626 --> 01:06:46.085
- Want another one?
- No! God!

01:06:46.169 --> 01:06:48.254
- If I had any more, I'd get surly.
- Oh, yeah?

01:06:48.338 --> 01:06:50.423
- Yeah.
- I'd pay to see that. Are you sure?

01:06:50.507 --> 01:06:52.884
Okay, well, that would be your funeral,
buddy.

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:57.180

You're singing Live right now.
You said you didn't know the band Live.

01:07:12.153 --> 01:07:14.280
- This is Live. You're singing it.
- No.

01:07:14.364 --> 01:07:16.407
I think you're drunk.
You're hallucinating.

01:07:16.491 --> 01:07:17.700

Hey.

01:09:21.032 --> 01:09:24.827
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to the airport.

01:09:25.953 --> 01:09:30.291
- What are you talkin' about?
- Yeah. This was a mistake.

01:09:31.751 --> 01:09:33.252
No, it wasn't.

01:09:33.336 --> 01:09:34.837
Hey, slow down.

01:09:34.921 --> 01:09:39.216
I've already called a nurse
to replace me and...

01:09:40.426 --> 01:09:42.886
she should probably be here by breakfast.

01:09:43.011 --> 01:09:46.265
Hey, Zooey. Come on. What is this?
What's goin' on here?

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:50.560
Hey, come on. You can't just leave.

01:09:50.853 --> 01:09:53.147
- What about Ben?
- He fired me last night.

01:09:53.272 --> 01:09:54.649
He fires you all the time.

01:09:54.732 --> 01:09:57.527
- Yeah. Now I'm takin' him up on it.
- Okay, but why now?

01:09:57.610 --> 01:10:00.113
- Why? What is going on?
- I can't do this, okay?

01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:02.156
Do what? What are you talking about?

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:05.368
- I'm not going to hurt you.
- You don't know that.

01:10:05.952 --> 01:10:08.871
Look. I get it, okay?
Your husband cheated on you.

01:10:08.955 --> 01:10:10.248
I'm not him.

01:10:10.331 --> 01:10:14.001
Okay, well, he didn't cheat on me.
I cheated on him.

01:10:14.127 --> 01:10:18.506
And I couldn't even tell you why.
I went and fucked someone.

01:10:20.758 --> 01:10:24.011
So what? So what? You made a mistake.

01:10:24.095 --> 01:10:26.222
It was three years ago.
He was the wrong guy.

01:10:26.305 --> 01:10:28.683
No. I am the wrong girl.

01:10:29.892 --> 01:10:33.354
Zooey, what about, "Nothing good
comes from living in the past."

01:10:33.438 --> 01:10:36.399
Yeah, and then you told me
I sounded like your ex-wife.

01:11:16.105 --> 01:11:17.106
Ben.

01:11:20.777 --> 01:11:21.778
Hey.

01:11:27.450 --> 01:11:28.618
Hello?

01:11:29.827 --> 01:11:33.039
Thanks, man. I appreciate it.
It will just take a second.

01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:35.500
He's probably just in here. Hey, Ben?

01:11:37.919 --> 01:11:40.630
Oh, shit! Hey! Ben!

01:11:41.088 --> 01:11:42.715
Ben! Are you okay?

01:11:42.799 --> 01:11:45.510
Sir! Sir! Go get help! Please!

01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:48.429
It's okay. You all right?

01:11:48.513 --> 01:11:50.306
- This is Beta One, come in.
- <i>Go ahead.</i>

01:11:50.389 --> 01:11:53.684
- Will you get help?
- We have a possible Code Blue in 428.

01:11:53.768 --> 01:11:54.894
It's okay.

01:12:20.002 --> 01:12:24.674
So I checked in with Ben's oncologist
in New York and shared some blood work.

01:12:25.758 --> 01:12:30.721
We can keep him comfortable, but at this
stage of cancer, that's all we can do.

01:12:31.305 --> 01:12:33.766
Now we can arrange
for his transfer to hospice,

01:12:33.850 --> 01:12:37.687
but I am afraid he will not be
able to travel back to New York.

01:12:39.605 --> 01:12:42.733
We're actually on our way to... Kansas.

01:12:43.693 --> 01:12:45.236
Oh, that's off the table.

01:12:46.237 --> 01:12:47.947
Matt, your father is very weak,

01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:52.910
and while we can keep him comfortable
here, he really doesn't have much longer.

01:12:53.828 --> 01:12:54.954
I'm sorry.

01:12:56.247 --> 01:12:58.374
I'll check back in in a little bit.

01:13:00.209 --> 01:13:02.169
- Yeah. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:13:31.073 --> 01:13:32.825
Coffee smells good.

01:13:35.119 --> 01:13:36.245
Hey.

01:13:37.246 --> 01:13:38.623
You want some?

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:05.691
How are you feeling?

01:14:07.735 --> 01:14:10.696
I'm dying. That's how I'm feeling.

01:14:13.824 --> 01:14:15.409
How long have I been here?

01:14:17.244 --> 01:14:19.497
Like a day and a half... about.

01:14:22.833 --> 01:14:24.126
Where's Zooey?

01:14:26.545 --> 01:14:29.215
- She left.
- Is she gone?

01:14:30.216 --> 01:14:35.429
I fired her before. It's the first time
she ever actually left.

01:14:37.848 --> 01:14:40.685
Do me a favor. Don't tell her I'm here

01:14:40.768 --> 01:14:42.895
She might blame herself.

01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:44.855
Of course.

01:15:55.718 --> 01:15:56.719
Need help?

01:16:04.143 --> 01:16:07.646
- Goes in that little slot there.
- Yeah, I know. I remember.

01:16:08.439 --> 01:16:10.983
Stretch it out. Nice and tight.

01:16:12.068 --> 01:16:14.570
Line it up so the teeth will bite.

01:16:15.362 --> 01:16:17.448
- Click it twice.
- That's right. Yeah.

01:16:18.741 --> 01:16:20.034
Yep.

01:16:21.368 --> 01:16:22.536
Good job.

01:16:30.127 --> 01:16:31.712
I used to feed you.

01:16:32.421 --> 01:16:34.507
What?

01:16:35.216 --> 01:16:37.593
At night while your mother slept.

01:16:39.345 --> 01:16:40.763
Give you the bottle.

01:16:44.517 --> 01:16:50.731
We were staying in this crappy
little apartment, Lower East Side.

01:16:53.317 --> 01:16:57.530
Then afterwards you'd lie...
you'd just lie there...

01:16:58.447 --> 01:17:00.908
with your head on my chest.

01:17:02.576 --> 01:17:04.578
You had this...

01:17:05.830 --> 01:17:08.666
smell, you know,
the way babies smell.

01:17:10.292 --> 01:17:11.627
And I would just...

01:17:12.336 --> 01:17:14.213
I'd just hold you.

01:17:16.757 --> 01:17:18.384
Feeling you breathe.

01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:26.767
I'd make all these promises to you.

01:17:30.771 --> 01:17:33.649
Tell you that I'd love you forever,

01:17:35.067 --> 01:17:37.069
always keep you safe,

01:17:42.032 --> 01:17:44.160
never let you feel alone.

01:17:49.123 --> 01:17:51.709
I was just filled with this...

01:17:54.378 --> 01:17:56.672
infinite love for you.

01:18:08.934 --> 01:18:14.106
I don't know what happened to me,
what broke inside of me.

01:18:16.942 --> 01:18:19.612
Maybe I was always broken. I don't know.

01:18:21.405 --> 01:18:23.866
But those nights with you, if I could...

01:18:25.117 --> 01:18:29.413
get to choose what time of my life
to live in forever, that would be it.

01:18:32.333 --> 01:18:37.630
That would be it. And I'm not asking
you to forgive me. I don't deserve....

01:18:44.136 --> 01:18:45.638
I just...

01:18:52.144 --> 01:18:53.604
I love you.

01:18:54.855 --> 01:18:56.440
I do. I really do.

01:18:59.818 --> 01:19:01.070
And I'm sorry.

01:19:25.719 --> 01:19:27.680
It's okay.

01:19:27.763 --> 01:19:30.307
Go to sleep. Okay? You're tired.

01:20:32.536 --> 01:20:33.954
Knock, knock.

01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:36.498
What do you got there?

01:20:37.124 --> 01:20:38.292
Your getaway vehicle.

01:20:39.168 --> 01:20:43.047
If we're gonna get that film to Dwayne's,
we gotta drive through the night.

01:20:43.130 --> 01:20:45.674
Tomorrow is the last day
they're developing Kodachrome.

01:20:46.133 --> 01:20:48.302
Never gonna let you take me out of here.

01:20:48.385 --> 01:20:50.304
That's why I'm not gonna ask.

01:20:56.727 --> 01:20:59.855
It appears I got this tube in my dick.

01:21:00.606 --> 01:21:04.193
- Shit.
- It's all right. I can get it. I got it.

01:21:04.276 --> 01:21:07.154
What do you mean you can get it? No.
No, no, no, no. Hey!

01:21:07.654 --> 01:21:11.533
You can't pull out your own catheter!
Stop it! Stop it! That's crazy!

01:21:11.617 --> 01:21:13.077
Oh, God.

01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:15.871
Dad! Don't!

01:21:18.415 --> 01:21:21.919
Fuck you. Get dressed.

01:21:22.002 --> 01:21:24.963

All right, I've got you in a single, king.

01:23:26.084 --> 01:23:30.631
No. No, we had... two rooms.
Separate rooms reserved.

01:23:30.756 --> 01:23:34.968
- Actually, three, but we only need two.
- I'm sorry. It's been insane.

01:23:35.052 --> 01:23:37.763
Just... we don't know
who's coming and who's going.

01:23:37.846 --> 01:23:40.057
Right now
all I've got is the one room.

01:23:41.975 --> 01:23:43.519
One sec.

01:23:49.525 --> 01:23:51.902
- We'll take it.
- Super.

01:23:52.819 --> 01:23:56.240
I should have it ready for you
in three or four hours.

01:23:57.324 --> 01:23:59.576
- Super...
- Fuck you. That's fucking cra... Okay.

01:23:59.743 --> 01:24:01.537
That's great. That's great.

01:24:02.871 --> 01:24:05.832
Sorry. Long drive. That's great.

01:24:08.126 --> 01:24:09.378
Watch your step.

01:24:15.759 --> 01:24:17.386
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:24:17.678 --> 01:24:19.471
Um...

01:24:19.555 --> 01:24:24.685
Excuse me. I wanted to give these rolls
to Dwayne personally.

01:24:26.186 --> 01:24:28.897
I'm sorry.
We stopped taking Kodachrome yesterday.

01:24:30.148 --> 01:24:33.318
You what? No. I called to confirm.
We were told Thursday.

01:24:33.777 --> 01:24:36.863
I know. I'm sorry. We ran out of dye
sooner than expected.

01:24:37.864 --> 01:24:42.035
Come on. Look, we just drove
2,000 miles to get here. I just...

01:24:42.119 --> 01:24:44.329
- Where's Dwayne?
- Ben Ryder.

01:24:44.413 --> 01:24:46.290
- There he is.
- You made it.

01:24:46.415 --> 01:24:48.333
- How you doin'?
- Good to see you.

01:24:48.417 --> 01:24:51.962
Your assistant here just told me you're
not processing any more Kodachrome.

01:24:52.045 --> 01:24:54.840
- She's fired. You're fired.
- Okay, Dad.

01:24:55.257 --> 01:24:58.760
Honey, this is Benjamin Asher Ryder,

01:24:58.885 --> 01:25:01.221
one of the world's greatest
living photographers.

01:25:01.305 --> 01:25:03.390
How do you do? This is my son, Matt.

01:25:03.473 --> 01:25:05.392
- Matt, nice to meet you.
- You too.

01:25:06.101 --> 01:25:09.563
Well, Ben, I will process these myself.

01:25:09.646 --> 01:25:13.025
I left a little room in the line
on the off chance you made it.

01:25:13.108 --> 01:25:15.777
Yeah, I was countin' on it.
I appreciate it.

01:25:16.486 --> 01:25:19.031
Can you believe it? The end of an era.

01:25:20.449 --> 01:25:23.910
I will have these ready
for you to pick up tomorrow.

01:25:24.286 --> 01:25:26.830
- Okay. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:25:31.793 --> 01:25:33.253
We could get food. You hungry?

01:25:33.337 --> 01:25:35.505
Yeah, I should put something
in my stomach.

01:25:35.589 --> 01:25:36.590
Yeah, same.

01:25:37.716 --> 01:25:40.594
I'm sorry. Aren't you Benjamin Ryder?

01:25:41.178 --> 01:25:43.388
- That's right.
- I don't believe it.

01:25:43.555 --> 01:25:47.184
I should have known you'd be here. I was
talking about you to Steve McCurry.

01:25:47.267 --> 01:25:48.935
I figured Steve would be here.

01:25:49.561 --> 01:25:52.230
- Ernie Coates from <i>National Geographic.</i>
- Ernie.

01:25:52.314 --> 01:25:55.400
You did that piece in Afghanistan,
didn't you? Yeah, that was great.

01:25:55.484 --> 01:25:56.401
Wow, you know...

01:25:56.485 --> 01:26:01.239
At the risk of embarrassing you, you're
the reason I became a photographer.

01:26:02.449 --> 01:26:04.618
Why would that embarrass me?

01:26:05.118 --> 01:26:06.703
Marie, come here.

01:26:09.956 --> 01:26:13.043
- This is Benjamin Ryder.
- No way.

01:26:13.126 --> 01:26:14.378
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

01:26:14.461 --> 01:26:16.838
A bunch of us were talking
about your Afghan series.

01:26:16.922 --> 01:26:20.467
Can you believe they're stopping it?
You must've been pretty pissed.

01:26:20.592 --> 01:26:23.720
No, not really.
A little sentimental, I guess, but...

01:26:24.554 --> 01:26:26.890
just a matter of time, you know.

01:26:26.973 --> 01:26:29.267
You know. Oh, geez.

01:26:29.351 --> 01:26:32.979
We're all so... so frightened by time,

01:26:33.063 --> 01:26:35.482
and the way it moves on,
the way things disappear.

01:26:35.607 --> 01:26:37.192
That's why we're photographers.

01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:40.821
We're preservationists by nature.

01:26:41.488 --> 01:26:43.699
We take pictures to stop time,

01:26:45.117 --> 01:26:47.411
to commit moments to eternity.

01:26:49.913 --> 01:26:52.541
Human nature made tangible.

01:26:54.918 --> 01:26:58.046
About as good a definition of art as any,
I guess.

01:26:58.130 --> 01:27:01.758
Ben.
Rick Ross. We were in Grenada together.

01:27:01.967 --> 01:27:04.553
- We were shooting for Reuters.
- Oh, my God.

01:27:06.096 --> 01:27:08.974
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

01:27:09.057 --> 01:27:11.518
Ben,
do you mind if I get a picture with you?

01:27:11.643 --> 01:27:14.271
Would it matter if I did? I don't know.

01:27:14.396 --> 01:27:16.398
Sure. That's okay.

01:27:20.026 --> 01:27:21.653
- Aw, that's great.
- There you go.

01:27:21.737 --> 01:27:24.239
- Thank you.
- You all be well now.

01:27:24.322 --> 01:27:26.283
- You too, Ben.
- Good to see you.

01:28:00.567 --> 01:28:02.194
Do you hear that?

01:28:07.199 --> 01:28:09.159
Hmm. All right.

01:28:10.786 --> 01:28:13.371
What should we do this evening? Huh?

01:28:14.664 --> 01:28:18.627
We could go see what Parsons, Kansas
has in the way of nightlife.

01:28:20.128 --> 01:28:21.755
I could actually eat again.

01:28:23.256 --> 01:28:26.843
Don't know if they have room service here.
Should we get a pizza?

01:28:27.552 --> 01:28:29.679
Go to a restaurant? Order in?

01:28:30.347 --> 01:28:32.641
Hello? Any thoughts on the matter?

01:28:55.622 --> 01:28:56.915
Okay, Dad.

01:28:58.708 --> 01:28:59.751
Okay.

01:30:48.735 --> 01:30:50.612
I'm sorry about Ben, Matt.

01:30:54.616 --> 01:30:57.535
I've been on the phone
with the medical examiner's office,

01:30:57.619 --> 01:30:59.621
tryin' to get the body released.

01:31:00.538 --> 01:31:02.832
Should be good to go shortly.

01:31:04.334 --> 01:31:06.169
- Thanks, Larry.
- Mr. Ryder.

01:31:07.337 --> 01:31:09.214
Dwayne from Dwayne's Photo.

01:31:09.297 --> 01:31:11.633
Yes. Hi. I remember you.

01:31:12.092 --> 01:31:14.761
Uh, this is Larry Holdt.

01:31:15.845 --> 01:31:17.222
- Sure.
- Ben's manager.

01:31:17.514 --> 01:31:21.726
I was...
very saddened to hear about your father.

01:31:22.811 --> 01:31:25.271
I wanted to deliver these personally.

01:31:25.939 --> 01:31:28.817
I know he was very protective of his work.

01:31:30.485 --> 01:31:33.905
Thank you. Yeah.
My dad would have appreciated it.

01:31:34.614 --> 01:31:37.117
Outside a roll I shot myself,

01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:41.454
these are the last rolls
of Kodachrome film ever to be developed.

01:31:41.955 --> 01:31:45.500
I think he would have liked the symmetry.

01:31:47.752 --> 01:31:48.837
Yeah.

01:31:49.546 --> 01:31:51.131
Take care.

01:31:51.631 --> 01:31:52.924
You too, Dwayne.

01:31:59.931 --> 01:32:01.516
- Here you go.
- Oh, no.

01:32:02.642 --> 01:32:04.561
Ben was very direct about it.

01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:07.814
He said you'd curate the show.

01:32:10.608 --> 01:32:13.445
I don't know anything about photography.
Why would he do that?

01:32:13.570 --> 01:32:17.657
I learned a long time ago
never to ask why where Ben was concerned.

01:32:23.371 --> 01:32:24.664
Hold on.

01:32:27.125 --> 01:32:28.251
Larry Holdt.

01:32:32.672 --> 01:32:38.511
<i>Now boarding zone three

Please leave me a message.</i>

01:32:45.810 --> 01:32:48.354

Ben.

01:33:17.050 --> 01:33:21.262
I'm tired of doing it. I don't want to
do it anymore, and I'm not gonna. And...

01:33:22.222 --> 01:33:24.140
Well, I want you to be...

01:33:26.309 --> 01:33:29.187
I'd love for you to be
one of the things I don't give up on.

01:33:33.441 --> 01:33:35.151

01:33:38.738 --> 01:33:40.949

01:37:57.080 --> 01:37:58.581
