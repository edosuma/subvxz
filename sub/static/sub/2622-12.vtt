00:13.555 --> 00:16.306
What the hell is that?

00:19.019 --> 00:22.021
What the hell is that? Is that you?

00:28.903 --> 00:32.281
- Boy, you're really not a morning person.
- Just back off!

00:35.243 --> 00:37.536
Get up! Get up! Get up!

00:42.500 --> 00:44.710
What is that noise?

00:44.878 --> 00:46.253
You.

00:48.715 --> 00:49.965
It's the chick.

00:50.133 --> 00:53.218
She's going through some changes.

00:54.304 --> 00:55.804
What kind of changes?

00:55.972 --> 00:59.725
Well, the vet seems to think
that she's becoming a rooster.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.230
We're getting a second opinion.

01:56.699 --> 01:59.368
Hey, what are you doing shopping
at 8 in the morning?

01:59.536 --> 02:00.744
Well, I've been up since 6...

02:00.912 --> 02:03.872
...thanks to somebody's
dumb-ass rooster.

02:04.707 --> 02:07.209
You guys,
you really should get rid of those animals.

02:07.377 --> 02:08.794
They shouldn't be in an apartment.

02:08.961 --> 02:12.297
Yeah, especially not with all these
knives and cookbooks around.

02:14.384 --> 02:18.011
All right, I'm gonna go to the fertility doctor
and, uh, see if I'm ready...

02:18.179 --> 02:21.181
...to have Frank and Alice's embryo
transferred into my uterus.

02:23.226 --> 02:24.852
Now, how will they know if you're ready?

02:25.019 --> 02:28.397
Oh, they're just gonna look and see
if my endometrial layer is thick.

02:28.731 --> 02:31.066
Oh, I can check that for you.

02:31.943 --> 02:33.318
Okay, everyone, think "thick."

02:33.903 --> 02:35.404
Good luck.

02:36.239 --> 02:37.656
- Hey. Wish me luck.
- Hey.

02:37.824 --> 02:39.867
- Oh, good luck.
- Good luck.

02:40.034 --> 02:43.328
- And I'm still right.
- That is so not true.

02:43.496 --> 02:44.746
What?

02:44.914 --> 02:47.249
She's mad because I know
today's her laundry day...

02:47.417 --> 02:50.127
...and that means she's wearing
her old-lady underpants.

02:52.297 --> 02:54.339
I can check that for you.

02:55.508 --> 02:58.594
I just can't believe that you think that you
and Chandler know me and Rachel...

02:58.761 --> 02:59.845
...better than we know you.

03:00.638 --> 03:03.056
Well, we do.

03:03.349 --> 03:06.476
You can only eat Tic Tacs
in even numbers.

03:06.644 --> 03:08.604
Yeah, what's that about?

03:09.147 --> 03:12.191
And you. Ross,
I believe if you check Rachel's bag...

03:12.358 --> 03:15.235
...you will find a half-eaten box
of cookies in there.

03:19.324 --> 03:21.158
You're good.

03:22.285 --> 03:24.203
These are not.

03:24.621 --> 03:27.664
I'm so not impressed.
Everybody snacks when they shop.

03:27.832 --> 03:28.874
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah?

03:29.042 --> 03:31.335
Ross, how many items left in that bag?

03:31.878 --> 03:33.212
- Five.
- Okay.

03:33.379 --> 03:38.008
Ten bucks says that we can name
every item in that bag.

03:38.301 --> 03:40.761
- How many guesses do you get?
- Six.

03:40.929 --> 03:42.554
Challenge extended.

03:44.599 --> 03:47.851
- Deal.
- Challenge accepted.

03:48.937 --> 03:50.896
All right, we'll start with...

03:51.689 --> 03:52.731
...apples.

03:52.899 --> 03:55.984
We'll be starting with apples.

03:58.071 --> 04:00.030
Stop that now.

04:01.950 --> 04:03.075
Yes.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.494
Okay. Uh, tortilla chips.

04:05.828 --> 04:07.204
- Yogurt.
- Diet soda.

04:07.830 --> 04:09.957
Yes, yes, yes.

04:11.834 --> 04:14.169
- Orange juice.
- No, there's no orange juice in there.

04:14.337 --> 04:15.712
- We win.
- Ha, ha.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.589
They have another guess.

04:18.632 --> 04:20.716
Okay, well, we won that one.

04:21.511 --> 04:23.553
Okay. The last thing is...

04:23.721 --> 04:25.806
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

04:27.725 --> 04:30.560
No, no. Not for, like, another two weeks.

04:33.731 --> 04:36.775
I got it. Scotch...

04:36.943 --> 04:38.443
...tape.

04:42.991 --> 04:45.450
How did you know
she would buy Scotch tape?

04:45.618 --> 04:47.828
Well, we used up theirs last night
making scary faces.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.498
Oh, man.

04:51.666 --> 04:54.543
All right. Ten bucks. Fork it over.

04:54.711 --> 04:57.879
Cough it up. Pay the piper.

04:58.256 --> 04:59.756
Give me it.

05:00.633 --> 05:03.385
That does not mean you know us better.
I want a rematch.

05:03.553 --> 05:07.055
Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery
questions. Real personal questions.

05:07.223 --> 05:09.558
Yeah. And the winner gets 100 bucks.

05:10.059 --> 05:11.685
Serious?

05:11.853 --> 05:13.645
Are you scared?

05:15.023 --> 05:16.523
No.

05:17.817 --> 05:19.901
Okay, who makes up the questions?

05:20.069 --> 05:21.570
Ross will do it.

05:21.738 --> 05:24.239
Oh, sure, Ross will do it.

05:24.407 --> 05:28.327
It's not like he has a job
or a child or a life of his own.

05:28.494 --> 05:30.370
Well, fine. We'll ask Phoebe.

05:30.538 --> 05:31.830
No, no, no, I wanna play.

05:37.378 --> 05:40.422
Looks like your uterus
is ready for implantation.

05:40.590 --> 05:43.300
Oh, I knew it. I knew it.
I felt really thick this morning.

05:43.468 --> 05:45.886
- Ha, ha.
- Okay, so, what's now?

05:46.054 --> 05:48.513
Go get the eggs. Put them in there.

05:48.681 --> 05:52.434
Okay. It'll take just a little while
to prepare the embryos.

05:52.602 --> 05:56.229
- Embryos? As in more than one?
- Mm-hm. Five, actually.

05:56.564 --> 05:58.690
Five? Okay, where am I giving birth...

05:58.858 --> 06:00.859
...in a hospital
or a big box under the stairs?

06:01.027 --> 06:04.613
Ha, ha. We do five because
that gives you a 25-percent chance...

06:04.781 --> 06:06.531
...that at least one will attach.

06:06.699 --> 06:08.617
That's it? Twenty-five percent?

06:08.785 --> 06:12.537
That means that it's, like,
75-percent chance of no baby at all?

06:12.705 --> 06:14.748
Yeah, you know, I was thinking,
what are the odds...

06:14.916 --> 06:17.709
...if, like, you stuff, like,
200 of them in there?

06:19.295 --> 06:20.879
Sweetie, now...

06:21.047 --> 06:22.923
...she's a woman,
not a gumball machine.

06:26.469 --> 06:28.178
Okay, well, you know what? Don't worry.

06:28.346 --> 06:31.348
I'm gonna do this as many times
as it takes to get it right.

06:31.516 --> 06:35.727
Well, see, the thing is,
we kind of only have one shot.

06:35.895 --> 06:39.314
Um, it costs $16,000
each time you do this.

06:40.650 --> 06:45.070
So, um, we're kind of using all the money
we have to do it just this one time.

06:45.488 --> 06:46.905
Whoa.

06:47.073 --> 06:51.535
That's... Okay, that's a lot of pressure
on me and my uterus.

06:52.495 --> 06:53.787
So... Well, okay.

06:53.955 --> 06:58.083
So maybe there's something that I can do,
you know, just to make sure I get pregnant.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.668
No, I'm sorry.

06:59.836 --> 07:02.587
Wow, you guys
really don't know anything.

07:03.923 --> 07:05.590
I know. Why doesn't she get drunk?

07:05.758 --> 07:08.677
That worked for a bunch of girls
in my high school.

07:13.516 --> 07:17.060
Hey, guys. Do you realize
that any minute now...

07:17.228 --> 07:18.687
...Phoebe could be pregnant?

07:18.855 --> 07:19.855
I know, I know.

07:20.022 --> 07:24.359
- It's such a huge, life-altering thing.
- I know.

07:25.778 --> 07:27.237
The test is ready.

07:30.867 --> 07:34.661
Okay. Each team will answer
10 questions.

07:34.829 --> 07:38.457
The first team to answer
the most questions wins.

07:38.624 --> 07:42.169
The categories are
"Fears And Pet Peeves"...

07:42.336 --> 07:44.337
..."Ancient History"...

07:44.505 --> 07:46.006
..."Literature"...

07:46.174 --> 07:48.425
...and "It's All Relative."

07:50.094 --> 07:55.307
Now, the coin toss,
to see who goes first.

08:02.190 --> 08:03.690
Okay.

08:03.858 --> 08:06.735
- Somebody call it this time.
- Yeah.

08:07.737 --> 08:08.820
Tails.

08:09.405 --> 08:11.406
- It's heads.
- Yeah!

08:12.742 --> 08:14.993
Gentlemen, pick your category.

08:15.161 --> 08:17.078
"Fears And Pet Peeves."

08:18.039 --> 08:21.166
"What is Monica's biggest pet peeve?"

08:21.501 --> 08:23.293
- Animals dressed as humans.
- That's correct.

08:26.380 --> 08:28.465
- Ladies?
- Same category.

08:28.633 --> 08:29.925
Okay.

08:30.343 --> 08:34.846
"According to Chandler, what phenomenon
scares the bejesus out of him?"

08:36.307 --> 08:38.975
Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance.

08:40.352 --> 08:41.477
That is correct.

08:44.190 --> 08:46.525
The Irish jig guy?

08:46.734 --> 08:50.862
His legs flail about
as if independent from his body.

08:52.448 --> 08:53.823
Gentlemen, your pick.

08:53.991 --> 08:55.408
"It's All Relative."

08:56.327 --> 08:58.912
"Monica and I had
a grandmother who died.

08:59.080 --> 09:01.206
You both went to her funeral.

09:01.749 --> 09:02.916
Name that grandmother."

09:06.337 --> 09:09.464
- Nana?
- She has a real name.

09:10.091 --> 09:11.174
- Althea.
- Althea?

09:11.342 --> 09:12.676
- What are you doing?
- Took a shot.

09:12.843 --> 09:13.885
Shooting with Althea?

09:14.053 --> 09:16.596
- Althea is correct.
- Nice shooting.

09:20.226 --> 09:21.476
We'll take "Literature."

09:22.144 --> 09:26.773
"Every week, the TV Guide comes
to Chandler and Joey's apartment.

09:26.983 --> 09:30.068
What name appears
on the address label?"

09:30.236 --> 09:32.529
Oh! Chandler gets it. It's Chandler Bing.

09:32.697 --> 09:33.738
No.

09:33.906 --> 09:38.076
I'm afraid the TV Guide
comes to "Chanandler Bong."

09:41.163 --> 09:42.622
I knew that.

09:42.832 --> 09:44.791
Rachel, use your head.

09:46.335 --> 09:48.962
Actually, it's Miss Chanandler Bong.

09:56.679 --> 09:58.888
Hello, teeny embryos.

10:00.516 --> 10:02.851
Oh, I'm Phoebe Buffay. Hi.

10:04.353 --> 10:08.273
I'm hoping to be your uterus
for the next nine months.

10:09.191 --> 10:11.735
You should know that
we're doing this for Frank and Alice...

10:11.902 --> 10:14.154
...who you know. You've been there.

10:15.281 --> 10:16.698
Um...

10:17.283 --> 10:19.242
You know, they want you so much.

10:19.410 --> 10:22.871
So when you guys get in there,
really grab on.

10:23.497 --> 10:27.042
Okay, and I promise that I'll keep you
safe and warm...

10:27.209 --> 10:30.545
...until, you know, you're ready
to have them take you home.

10:31.839 --> 10:33.173
So...

10:33.716 --> 10:34.799
Okay.

10:35.384 --> 10:38.970
Oh, and also, next time you see me,
if I'm screaming, don't worry.

10:39.180 --> 10:41.556
That's what's supposed to happen.

10:43.392 --> 10:45.268
- Ready?
- Uh-huh?

10:46.020 --> 10:47.562
Good luck.

10:49.440 --> 10:52.901
All right, the score is nine to eight
in favor of the guys.

10:53.069 --> 10:56.655
Ladies, if you miss this,
the game is theirs. Pick your category.

10:56.822 --> 10:58.740
"It's All Relative"!

11:00.284 --> 11:03.411
- You don't have to shout everything.
- I'm sorry!

11:05.706 --> 11:10.210
Ooh. "What is the name
of Chandler's father's...

11:10.378 --> 11:13.213
...Las Vegas all-male burlesque?"

11:13.964 --> 11:16.633
Viva Las Gaygas.

11:18.552 --> 11:20.679
Unfortunately, that is correct.

11:20.846 --> 11:22.514
Yes.

11:22.682 --> 11:25.350
All right. We have a tie.

11:25.518 --> 11:29.688
Luckily, I've prepared
for such an event.

11:31.023 --> 11:33.692
- The Lightning Round.
- Ooh.

11:35.820 --> 11:39.489
Thirty seconds.
All the questions you can answer.

11:39.657 --> 11:41.533
You guys are dead.

11:41.701 --> 11:44.160
I am so good at Lightning Rounds.

11:45.955 --> 11:48.665
I majored in Lightning Rounds,
all right?

11:48.833 --> 11:51.209
- We're gonna destroy you.
- Want to bet?

11:51.794 --> 11:55.088
Oh, I'm so confused as to what
we've been doing so far.

11:56.507 --> 11:59.801
How about we play for more money?
Say 150?

11:59.969 --> 12:02.679
One hundred and fifty dollars.

12:04.098 --> 12:06.015
Say 200?

12:06.183 --> 12:08.810
Two hundred dollars.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.478
You're doing it again.

12:10.646 --> 12:12.313
Excuse me.

12:12.857 --> 12:15.316
- Monica, I don't want to lose $200.
- We won't.

12:15.484 --> 12:16.693
- Okay.
- Three hundred?

12:17.987 --> 12:20.238
- Monica.
- I'm just trying to spice it up.

12:20.406 --> 12:23.992
Okay, so then play for some pepper.
Stop spending my money.

12:25.327 --> 12:26.578
I got it.

12:26.746 --> 12:30.081
How about if we win,
they have to get rid of the rooster.

12:30.291 --> 12:32.083
Ooh, that's interesting.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.335
Hey, no way. That rooster's family.

12:34.503 --> 12:36.796
- Throw in the duck too.
- What do you have against the duck?

12:36.964 --> 12:40.008
- It doesn't make noise.
- Well, he gets the other one all riled up.

12:40.593 --> 12:43.303
- Look, we are not...
- All right, hold on.

12:45.181 --> 12:46.723
If you win...

12:46.891 --> 12:48.933
...we give up the bird.
- Aah!

12:51.604 --> 12:53.354
But if we win...

12:53.647 --> 12:55.690
...we get your apartment.

12:55.858 --> 12:57.776
Ooh!

12:58.736 --> 12:59.778
Deal!

13:04.533 --> 13:07.494
Monica, betting the apartment?
I don't know about this.

13:07.661 --> 13:10.246
Rachel, I have not missed
one question the whole game.

13:10.414 --> 13:11.664
I own this game.

13:11.832 --> 13:13.041
Look at my hand.

13:13.209 --> 13:15.251
Why, do you have the answers
written on there?

13:16.629 --> 13:19.839
No. Steady as a rock.
Now, are you with me?

13:21.050 --> 13:23.676
- All right, let's do it. Okay.
- Come on.

13:24.303 --> 13:26.054
All right. Gentlemen, you're up first.

13:26.222 --> 13:27.263
Okay.

13:27.431 --> 13:29.724
You have 30 seconds.

13:30.684 --> 13:33.061
The Lightning Round begins...

13:33.229 --> 13:34.687
Stop it.

13:36.524 --> 13:39.651
Now. "What was Monica's nickname
when she was a field-hockey goalie?"

13:39.819 --> 13:41.778
- Big Fat Goalie.
- Correct.

13:44.365 --> 13:46.783
"Rachel claims
this is her favorite movie."

13:46.951 --> 13:48.368
- Dangerous Liaisons.
- Correct.

13:48.536 --> 13:51.204
- "Her actual favorite is?" Correct.
- Weekend at Bernie's.

13:53.249 --> 13:57.627
"In what part of her body did Monica
get a pencil stuck at age 14?"

13:57.795 --> 13:59.087
Oh!

14:01.549 --> 14:02.924
Ew, no!

14:05.219 --> 14:06.344
Her ear.

14:09.598 --> 14:13.726
All right, "Monica categorizes her towels.
How many categories are there?"

14:13.894 --> 14:15.270
- Okay, everyday use.
- Fancy.

14:15.437 --> 14:16.855
- Guest.
- Fancy guest.

14:17.022 --> 14:18.982
- Two seconds.
- Uh, eleven?

14:20.109 --> 14:22.360
Eleven. Unbelievable.
Eleven is correct.

14:22.528 --> 14:23.778
Yes!

14:26.365 --> 14:27.407
All right.

14:27.575 --> 14:29.868
That's four for the guys.
Ladies, you're up.

14:30.035 --> 14:31.828
All right, all right, come on!

14:35.749 --> 14:37.876
Thirty seconds on the clock.

14:38.043 --> 14:40.545
Five correct questions wins the game.

14:40.963 --> 14:44.382
The Lightning Round begins now.
"What is Joey's favorite food?"

14:44.550 --> 14:46.009
- Sandwiches.
- Correct.

14:46.176 --> 14:48.720
"Chandler was how old
when he first touched a girl's breast?"

14:48.888 --> 14:50.221
- Fourteen?
- No, 19.

14:50.389 --> 14:51.764
Thanks, man.

14:52.391 --> 14:54.601
"Joey had an imaginary
childhood friend.

14:54.768 --> 14:56.394
- His name was..."
- Maurice.

14:56.562 --> 14:58.146
- "His profession was?"
- Space cowboy.

14:58.314 --> 14:59.606
Correct.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.151
"What is Chandler Bing's job?"

15:05.321 --> 15:06.738
Oh.

15:07.239 --> 15:09.657
Oh, gosh.
It has something to do with numbers.

15:09.825 --> 15:11.868
- And processing.
- And he carries a briefcase.

15:12.036 --> 15:14.454
Ten seconds.
You need this or you lose the game.

15:14.663 --> 15:16.539
It has something to do
with transponding.

15:16.707 --> 15:19.792
Oh! Oh! He's a transponster.

15:21.670 --> 15:23.546
That's not even a word!

15:25.132 --> 15:27.717
I can get this. I can get this.

15:29.261 --> 15:30.762
No!

15:30.930 --> 15:32.138
Yes!

15:44.485 --> 15:48.029
- I call Monica's room.
- You can't just call Monica's room.

15:48.197 --> 15:51.950
Sure I can. Standard Shotgun Rules.
I'm in sight of the room and I called it.

15:54.495 --> 15:55.703
Damn.

15:57.081 --> 15:58.957
Man, I feel like I'm coming down
with something.

15:59.124 --> 16:01.042
- Oh.
- Yeah.

16:01.210 --> 16:04.087
Bet you can't guess what color
my tonsils are. I bet the apartment.

16:04.254 --> 16:06.839
Oh, I would never bet this apartment.
It's too nice.

16:09.218 --> 16:11.636
- Hey.
- Ooh, Pheebs, are they in there?

16:11.804 --> 16:13.638
Um, yeah, uh-huh, I'm implanted.

16:14.181 --> 16:17.392
- How do you feel?
- Well, freaked.

16:17.935 --> 16:21.354
Because it turns out the odds
are, like, really sucky.

16:21.522 --> 16:24.232
And this is Frank and Alice's,
like, only shot.

16:24.400 --> 16:27.819
I mean, they are, like, literally putting
all their eggs in my basket.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.155
Yeah, but I bet it works.

16:31.532 --> 16:33.574
Really? How much?

16:35.411 --> 16:38.162
All right, I'm gonna go take
a pregnancy test right now.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.248
Oh, wow. You can tell this soon?

16:40.416 --> 16:42.542
Well, the doctor says
it takes a couple days.

16:42.710 --> 16:47.005
But, I mean, my body's always been
a little faster than Western medicine, so...

16:50.884 --> 16:54.345
Oh, my God. I can't believe you guys
actually think you're moving in here.

16:54.513 --> 16:56.931
Well, believe it, baby.

16:58.183 --> 16:59.726
Well, I'm not moving.

16:59.893 --> 17:01.185
What?

17:01.895 --> 17:05.397
No. It was a stupid bet.
We were just playing a game.

17:05.566 --> 17:07.942
You just can't ignore the bet. It's a bet.

17:08.109 --> 17:10.653
You bet on a bet, and if you lose,
you lose the bet.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.281
Rach, we have to move.

17:13.449 --> 17:15.867
If we had lost, we would have
made them get rid of the birds.

17:17.411 --> 17:18.994
No.

17:20.705 --> 17:24.916
All right, look, I hate this as much as you,
but if it makes you feel better...

17:25.085 --> 17:27.211
...this is all your fault.

17:28.964 --> 17:31.090
- What?
- Chanandler Bong.

17:31.258 --> 17:33.384
Come on, we steal that TV Guide
every week.

17:33.552 --> 17:35.470
I knew it.

17:36.555 --> 17:38.848
I don't care. I'm not going anywhere.

17:39.016 --> 17:41.267
Cool. Girl roommate.

17:44.980 --> 17:46.439
Well?

17:46.607 --> 17:48.858
Nope, not knocked up yet.

17:49.234 --> 17:51.527
It's only been a couple hours,
so just give it some time.

17:51.695 --> 17:54.989
Yeah, all right. Meanwhile,
I'm gonna do whatever I can to help this...

17:55.157 --> 17:59.160
...so I'm just gonna, you know,
lie in your chair, okay?

17:59.828 --> 18:00.995
You know, just...

18:01.163 --> 18:03.956
Yeah, good. I'm gonna let gravity,
you know, do its jobs.

18:09.254 --> 18:11.422
Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand
with this box?

18:11.590 --> 18:15.134
No. Put that box down.
We are not going anywhere!

18:16.345 --> 18:19.347
This is my apartment and I like it.

18:19.515 --> 18:21.682
This is a girl's apartment.

18:21.850 --> 18:26.270
That is a boy's apartment.
It's dirty and it smells.

18:26.438 --> 18:29.357
This is pretty. It's so pretty.

18:29.525 --> 18:31.734
And look, and it's purple.

18:31.902 --> 18:35.530
And I'm telling you, you with
your steady hand, I am not moving.

18:35.697 --> 18:38.699
And now I have got the steady hand.

18:39.618 --> 18:41.494
- I'll take care of it.
- That's right.

18:41.662 --> 18:43.579
You do what the hand says.

18:55.801 --> 18:57.969
- How'd it go?
- I lost our mattresses.

19:03.392 --> 19:05.351
Are you in there, little fetus?

19:05.519 --> 19:07.979
In nine months, will you come greet us?

19:09.439 --> 19:12.942
I will buy you some Adidas

19:16.321 --> 19:17.572
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:17.739 --> 19:19.699
Oh, hi, Phoebe?

19:19.867 --> 19:24.495
Um, we were just at the drugstore,
um, so we got you a little present.

19:24.997 --> 19:28.916
Um, it's a lollipop
and a home pregnancy test.

19:29.877 --> 19:33.337
Hey, don't mix those up.
You could really ruin that lollipop.

19:36.341 --> 19:41.554
So, um, you feel like taking a test?
There's only one question.

19:44.349 --> 19:46.559
All right. I will. No, I will.

19:46.727 --> 19:49.395
But, um, you know, just remember
that it's still really early.

19:49.563 --> 19:51.731
Okay, so if it says
that I'm not pregnant...

19:51.899 --> 19:54.358
...that doesn't mean
I'm not gonna get pregnant, okay?

19:54.526 --> 19:57.445
And just, please,
just so I don't go completely nuts...

19:57.613 --> 20:00.948
...just try not to put all your hopes
on this, okay?

20:01.116 --> 20:02.158
Okay.

20:04.828 --> 20:06.454
Great.

20:14.213 --> 20:17.965
You know what? You are mean boys
who are just being mean.

20:18.133 --> 20:21.469
Hey, don't get mad at us.
No one forced you to raise the stakes.

20:21.637 --> 20:24.222
That is not true. She did. She forced me.

20:24.389 --> 20:26.933
We'd still be here if you hadn't
got the question wrong.

20:27.100 --> 20:29.435
Well, it was a stupid, unfair question!

20:29.603 --> 20:31.270
Don't blame the questions!

20:31.438 --> 20:33.689
Would you all stop yelling
in our apartment?

20:33.857 --> 20:35.858
You are ruining moving day for us.

20:36.026 --> 20:38.653
- Would you stop calling it your apartment?
- It is ours.

20:41.323 --> 20:43.324
Guys, you guys,
you're gonna have a baby.

20:43.492 --> 20:45.076
They're gonna have a baby.

20:51.500 --> 20:54.919
My sister's going to have my baby!

21:03.428 --> 21:06.430
Okay, but this can't be good
for the baby.

21:18.443 --> 21:20.528
I can't find garbage bags.

21:20.696 --> 21:22.863
Oh, I think I saw some in here.

21:27.911 --> 21:29.370
What is it?

21:29.913 --> 21:34.375
I don't know. But maybe if we keep
that drawer shut, it'll die.

21:35.335 --> 21:38.254
I can't believe we're living here.

21:44.011 --> 21:45.177
What? What is it?

21:45.345 --> 21:47.054
Did you see the size of the closets?

21:48.932 --> 21:52.143
I can't believe we live here.
