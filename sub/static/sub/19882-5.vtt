WEBVTT

00:06.625 --> 00:08.958
How much gold is this
Nas Stone fellow looking to buy?

00:09.000 --> 00:10.542
250K sterling.

00:10.625 --> 00:12.018
That should take care
of your immediate problem.

00:12.042 --> 00:14.000
- King Royston's boy.
- Yeah.

00:14.083 --> 00:16.166
I haven't seen you
around here in a while.

00:16.167 --> 00:17.333
Didn't think I was welcome.

00:19.667 --> 00:20.792
Business or pleasure?

00:20.833 --> 00:22.458
Loads of pleasure.

00:22.500 --> 00:24.667
My man!
How you want your skrilla?

00:24.708 --> 00:26.000
Cash.

00:26.042 --> 00:28.125
- Who are you?
- I'm Uncle Dean.

00:29.417 --> 00:31.625
Looks like you're single, girl.

00:31.667 --> 00:34.292
I never could smell
the roses, Mrs. Hill,

00:34.333 --> 00:36.583
but I could always sniff out
a rotten apple.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.074

00:47.000 --> 00:49.458
<i>Well, it all went
according to plan.</i>

00:49.500 --> 00:52.500
Until it didn't. Yeah.

00:54.500 --> 00:58.125
Yeah, listen, I'm going away
for a very long time, darling.

00:58.167 --> 01:00.499
I need you to be tough, Lil.

01:00.500 --> 01:03.666
I need you to be hard as nails.

01:03.667 --> 01:07.583
And I need you to do
something very important for me.

01:07.625 --> 01:11.333
I want you to send
a smoke signal

01:11.375 --> 01:14.958
to every firm on the plot.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.375
You tell them there's
bent cops on the streets

01:18.417 --> 01:20.375
with gold.

01:20.417 --> 01:22.250
Shit loads of gold.

01:22.333 --> 01:24.332
You tell them finders keepers.

01:24.333 --> 01:27.333
You tell them I don't care.

01:27.375 --> 01:31.499
I don't care who gets the gold.

01:31.500 --> 01:32.666
So long...

01:32.667 --> 01:34.332
as it's not...

01:34.333 --> 01:36.333
Bob Fink.

01:38.833 --> 01:40.625
Bingo.

02:40.667 --> 02:41.684
Give us a minute,
would you, Charlie?

02:41.708 --> 02:43.083
Who is that lump, Al?

02:43.125 --> 02:45.375
You don't wanna know.

02:48.833 --> 02:51.417
Patsy.

02:51.500 --> 02:53.542
So what's it gonna be, Albert?

02:53.625 --> 02:56.875
The bolt cutters
or a happy ending?

03:00.917 --> 03:02.792
Here you are.

03:02.833 --> 03:04.417
It's all there.
It's all accounted for.

03:04.458 --> 03:08.166
Every last bean.

03:08.167 --> 03:10.083
So we good?

03:10.125 --> 03:14.417
Skin of your teeth, son.

03:14.458 --> 03:16.458
Now don't forget,

03:16.500 --> 03:20.333
if you ever need a stop gap,
you got my digits, boy.

03:20.375 --> 03:22.208
First stop, take a little
trip to Saul Gold.

03:22.250 --> 03:23.667
Get him off my case.

03:23.708 --> 03:25.167
Yeah, the best place
for your cock

03:25.208 --> 03:26.999
might have been that pickle jar.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.499
And what is that
supposed to mean?

03:28.500 --> 03:29.832
No, just kidding, Al.

03:29.833 --> 03:31.499
You know, sense of humor
and all that.

03:31.500 --> 03:32.726
Yeah, well, I fail to see
the funny in that

03:32.750 --> 03:34.792
actually, Charlie.

03:42.792 --> 03:44.792
Mum?

03:44.833 --> 03:48.167
Mum!

03:48.250 --> 03:52.208
- No, no, no, no!
- This cannot be happening!

03:52.250 --> 03:53.976
- Where's the gold, Al?
- Give me a second, Charlie.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.708
- All right?
- Where is it?!

03:55.750 --> 03:57.351
How are we gonna fix this
unmitigated fucking disaster?!

03:57.375 --> 03:58.958
Will you shut up?!

03:59.000 --> 04:00.542
Charlie, give us
a minute, please.

04:03.125 --> 04:05.167
Of course, Mrs. H, yeah.

04:12.833 --> 04:15.667
When were you planning
on telling me?

04:15.708 --> 04:19.708
I didn't want
to worry you, did I?

04:19.791 --> 04:22.292
It's a bit late for that.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.667
Talk.

04:30.625 --> 04:32.332
On fight night,
we went after Castillo,

04:32.333 --> 04:35.292
but we hit the wrong truck.

04:35.333 --> 04:37.250
The truck we did hit
was transporting the gold.

04:37.292 --> 04:38.833
Who's gold is it, Albert?

04:38.875 --> 04:42.500
I don't know.

04:42.542 --> 04:44.667
But it's got
the same stamp as Dad.

04:44.708 --> 04:47.625
This bloody gold.

04:47.667 --> 04:50.333
Bloody, bloody family!

04:50.375 --> 04:52.332
Leave it now,
it's gone now, leave it!

04:52.333 --> 04:55.875
Bob Fink was here yesterday
asking about dad.

04:55.917 --> 04:58.500
Asking about you, Albert.

04:58.542 --> 05:01.000
Bob Fink was in here?

05:01.042 --> 05:03.832
Did he do this, Mum?

05:03.833 --> 05:06.750
That would be my guess, yes.

05:06.792 --> 05:09.000
He didn't find the gold, though.

05:09.083 --> 05:11.958
So where is it?

05:12.000 --> 05:14.458
I should've thrown it
in the bloody river.

05:14.500 --> 05:16.708
Mum, where is it?

05:16.750 --> 05:20.167
I moved it down the market
to Father John's.

05:22.583 --> 05:26.458
You beauty. Come on, Charlie.

05:42.833 --> 05:44.833
You got plans?

05:48.667 --> 05:50.667
Maybe.

05:52.667 --> 05:54.667
Maybe what?

05:58.000 --> 06:02.625
Who's to say we got
those diamonds back?

06:02.667 --> 06:04.708
- Maybe...
- Mwah.

06:04.750 --> 06:06.143
We could take
a long ride together.

06:06.167 --> 06:08.667
Mwah.

06:08.708 --> 06:12.458
Get out of this shithole.

06:12.500 --> 06:15.333
Nothing holding us down,
nothing holding us back.

06:17.333 --> 06:20.833
Live life on the move.

06:20.875 --> 06:22.875
Freedom.

06:31.792 --> 06:35.083
Keep the stones.

06:35.125 --> 06:37.792
Leave the others with the gold.

06:37.833 --> 06:40.708
Fair trade, if you ask me.

06:47.458 --> 06:50.208
I've been best mates
with Al for 20 years.

06:50.250 --> 06:51.833
You think I'll bail on him

06:51.875 --> 06:55.167
for a half-decent
pair of tits like you?

06:55.208 --> 06:56.750
Half-decent?

06:56.833 --> 06:59.833
Best tits you ever
copped hold of.

06:59.875 --> 07:01.375
I had to keep an eye on you

07:01.417 --> 07:03.000
while Castillo
was still a threat.

07:03.042 --> 07:05.000
Now it's done.

07:05.042 --> 07:06.625
You kicking me out?

07:06.667 --> 07:09.332
I've got nowhere to go,
you asshole!

07:09.333 --> 07:11.083
You're a smart girl!

07:11.125 --> 07:12.292
You'll work something out.

07:12.333 --> 07:13.958
Yeah, too smart

07:14.000 --> 07:15.393
to be with a cupboard
squatter like you.

07:15.417 --> 07:18.832
Moving on?

07:18.833 --> 07:20.875
Moving on.

07:29.208 --> 07:30.875
- No.
- Yes.

07:30.917 --> 07:32.208
- No!
- Yes!

07:32.250 --> 07:34.375
No, how did you
pull that off, Billy?

07:34.417 --> 07:37.333
Well, four Pikeys
walk into a pub...

07:39.375 --> 07:42.332
Yes. What about Castillo?

07:42.333 --> 07:44.542
There is no Castillo, Al.

07:44.625 --> 07:46.208
What about Norman?

07:46.292 --> 07:47.332
He still got a pulse?

07:47.333 --> 07:48.999
Barely!

07:49.000 --> 07:50.351
They dropped him off
at your mum's.

07:50.375 --> 07:51.875
My mum's, why?

07:51.958 --> 07:53.393
We couldn't exactly
take him to the hospital

07:53.417 --> 07:54.601
with fragments of safe
decorating his face,

07:54.625 --> 07:55.792
now could we?

07:55.833 --> 07:59.083
All right, fair enough.

07:59.125 --> 08:02.042
Bob Fink's messed the shop up.

08:02.083 --> 08:03.417
Bob Fink?

08:03.458 --> 08:04.726
Reckon he was looking
for the gold.

08:04.750 --> 08:06.417
How did that turncoat
get onto us?

08:06.458 --> 08:09.542
I have absolutely no idea.

08:09.583 --> 08:10.917
Yeah.

08:10.958 --> 08:12.917
That one...

08:12.958 --> 08:16.750
might... might just be on me.

08:16.792 --> 08:18.999
The video.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.833
My bloody slippers.

08:20.875 --> 08:22.750
Slippers?

08:22.833 --> 08:24.875
Make some sense, Charlie.

08:24.917 --> 08:27.167
Fink cornered me the other day.

08:32.292 --> 08:33.875
Ooh!

08:33.957 --> 08:35.726
Spouting some nonsense
about seeing my slippers

08:35.750 --> 08:36.957
on the heist video.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.499
What?

08:39.500 --> 08:40.957
And you told him what exactly?

08:41.000 --> 08:42.417
I didn't say a word.

08:42.457 --> 08:43.875
Okay, he got nothing from me.

08:43.917 --> 08:45.417
You might as well
have worn a badge

08:45.458 --> 08:47.583
with your name on it.

08:47.625 --> 08:50.042
You should've told me
about this, Charlie.

08:50.083 --> 08:51.458
We could have avoided
this problem.

08:51.500 --> 08:53.417
Well, I messed up.

08:53.458 --> 08:55.042
Okay, I'm sorry, guys.

08:55.083 --> 08:56.934
It's not like I'm a seasoned
armed robber, is it?

08:56.958 --> 08:58.333
No, you're not.

08:58.375 --> 08:59.750
Now I've burned the bloody eggs.

08:59.833 --> 09:01.351
I'm gonna get these back
to Saul Gold.

09:01.375 --> 09:03.875
Ooh, yeah, wait for me, Al.

09:08.667 --> 09:10.875
This better blow
my wig back, boy.

09:28.167 --> 09:30.500
The inventory's accounted for.

09:33.833 --> 09:34.917
So we're done?

09:34.958 --> 09:36.292
Don't get all puffed up

09:36.333 --> 09:38.125
because you fixed
your own screw-up.

09:38.167 --> 09:42.833
Your father, poor bastard,
can rest a little easier now.

09:42.875 --> 09:44.667
Now, listen good.

09:44.708 --> 09:47.833
I've got a pickup down
by the railyard,

09:47.875 --> 09:49.542
and I need two boys.

09:49.625 --> 09:50.792
Couldn't be simpler.

10:02.583 --> 10:04.083
I've got a Sheikh
with more money

10:04.125 --> 10:05.625
than a horse has hair.

10:05.667 --> 10:07.708
He needs a wedding gift
for his new wife.

10:07.750 --> 10:09.875
What kind of a wedding gift?

10:09.917 --> 10:12.417
I don't know yet, but I've
set up a meeting to find out.

10:12.458 --> 10:14.833
Lovely, so what you need
me to do?

10:14.875 --> 10:17.542
It's what Charlie
Cavendish-Scott can do.

10:17.583 --> 10:20.333
Do tell.

10:20.375 --> 10:23.083
So Sheikh Zeshan studied
at Oxford University.

10:23.167 --> 10:25.875
He'll be used to a...

10:25.917 --> 10:29.999
certain type of Englishman.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.167
Country estates
not council estates, I get it.

10:36.833 --> 10:39.542
Let's pay your Sheikh a visit.

10:39.625 --> 10:42.500
Let's put him into
a gold state of mind.

11:01.250 --> 11:04.833
I heard the good news.

11:06.375 --> 11:08.166
All sorted with Saul.

11:08.167 --> 11:09.750
Told you I'd sort it, didn't I?

11:09.833 --> 11:11.518
And sort it you did
my boy, and sort it you did.

11:11.542 --> 11:14.499
Mwah!

11:14.500 --> 11:16.375
You're chipper.

11:16.458 --> 11:18.458
What happen, you win the bingo?

11:18.500 --> 11:20.166
Well, you know,
a stretch in the hole

11:20.167 --> 11:23.750
gives one time to reflect
upon life's priorities.

11:23.792 --> 11:24.833
The hole?

11:24.917 --> 11:26.333
Come on, what did you do?

11:26.417 --> 11:28.166
No, the prison therapist
calls the hole

11:28.167 --> 11:30.708
a metaphor
for my emotional condition.

11:30.750 --> 11:32.875
If, perish the thought,
you'd visit me

11:32.917 --> 11:34.518
a little more often
these past few months,

11:34.542 --> 11:35.893
you'd be more acquainted
with what your old man's

11:35.917 --> 11:37.833
been going through.

11:37.875 --> 11:39.143
I've terribly sorry, Dad.
Why don't you tell me?

11:39.167 --> 11:40.542
What have you
been going through?

11:40.583 --> 11:44.417
Well... I've had visions, son.

11:44.458 --> 11:46.833
Visions of the past.

11:46.875 --> 11:49.542
Visions of the future.

11:49.583 --> 11:52.417
Visions of how things should be.

11:59.375 --> 12:02.667
What's the skinny
on the truck heist?

12:02.708 --> 12:07.083
The gold bullion?

12:07.125 --> 12:09.750
Don't know, the street
went dark on that one.

12:09.792 --> 12:12.625
But you've seen
the video, haven't you?

12:12.667 --> 12:15.458
Yeah, of course I have.
Who hasn't?

12:17.958 --> 12:19.458
It really reminded me...

12:19.500 --> 12:21.583
the way they robbed
that truck...

12:21.625 --> 12:25.083
of...

12:25.125 --> 12:26.583
me!

12:26.625 --> 12:30.167
Although, it does
lack a certain finesse.

12:30.208 --> 12:32.167
All brass bollocks

12:32.208 --> 12:35.208
and no brains.

12:38.375 --> 12:40.667
So what's the plan
with the winnings?

12:40.708 --> 12:42.643
What are you gonna do with it
on the inside, anyway?

12:42.667 --> 12:46.125
There is no inside.

12:46.167 --> 12:49.666
No walls.

12:49.667 --> 12:52.125
None that matter, anyway.

12:55.042 --> 12:57.708
You look tired, son.

12:57.750 --> 12:59.750
Get some rest.

13:19.375 --> 13:23.000
Do you trust Father John
with our gold, Al?

13:23.042 --> 13:26.166
I don't trust anyone
with that gold, Billy.

13:26.167 --> 13:27.625
Until we can move it,

13:27.667 --> 13:29.500
better the devil we know?

13:37.500 --> 13:39.458
Comes from the Lord!

13:39.500 --> 13:41.792
He who keeps you
will not slumber.

13:41.833 --> 13:43.917
The Lord will keep you
from all evil.

13:43.958 --> 13:45.542
Amen.

13:47.542 --> 13:50.250
- You get all that, Billy-Boy?
- I'm born again, Al.

13:50.292 --> 13:53.500
In the house of Father John.

13:53.542 --> 13:56.375
Albert Hill.

13:56.417 --> 13:58.875
Give him praise.
Give him adoration.

13:58.917 --> 14:01.500
So it appears you have
inherited your father's

14:01.542 --> 14:02.833
spirit for adventure.

14:02.875 --> 14:05.208
Something like that,
Father John.

14:05.292 --> 14:06.958
Life's either a great adventure

14:07.000 --> 14:11.333
or nothing at all, my son.

14:11.417 --> 14:13.999
I have a parish project

14:14.000 --> 14:16.083
I'd like to discuss with you.

14:20.958 --> 14:23.042
Give whatever you can give.

14:23.083 --> 14:24.625
Reach in your pocket and...

14:28.208 --> 14:31.625
Are you looking
for redemption, mate?

14:31.667 --> 14:34.500
Redemption? Before lunch?

14:34.542 --> 14:37.083
Your path begins here, brother.

14:37.167 --> 14:39.542
With Father John.

14:39.583 --> 14:41.999
For a tenner.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Cheap at half the price.

14:46.708 --> 14:49.208
Keeps the Devil from your door.

14:57.458 --> 14:59.417
Speak of the Devil

14:59.458 --> 15:02.042
and his horns shall appear!

15:07.125 --> 15:09.125
Put one of those on ice for me.

15:15.250 --> 15:18.332
I trust attendance is good
at the moment, Father John?

15:18.333 --> 15:20.875
Yeah, well, there are
many lost souls in need

15:20.917 --> 15:23.333
of the Lord's protection
in these most troubled of times.

15:28.458 --> 15:31.500
So what's the price to keep
my commodity safe and sound?

15:31.583 --> 15:35.166
That depends on the value
of the commodity

15:35.167 --> 15:37.333
and its exposure.

15:37.417 --> 15:39.750
Two million views.

15:42.625 --> 15:44.458
The Internet is
a marvel of communication,

15:44.500 --> 15:46.042
is it not, Albert?

15:46.083 --> 15:47.833
So what's this gonna run me?

15:47.875 --> 15:51.333
Well, the mission is
in desperate need of repair.

15:51.375 --> 15:55.292
I've been quoted 50,000
for a new roof.

15:55.333 --> 15:57.666
A fair contribution
for the work involved.

15:57.667 --> 16:00.542
And what insurance do I get
for this contribution?

16:08.208 --> 16:11.375
Security's tighter than
Fort Knox's asshole, son.

16:22.292 --> 16:24.458
50 grand to a bent priest?

16:24.500 --> 16:26.583
Mate, I thought we were the ones

16:26.625 --> 16:28.101
supposed to be making good
off the gold.

16:28.125 --> 16:29.226
We just gotta find a buyer.

16:29.250 --> 16:30.875
Charlie, where are you?

16:30.917 --> 16:34.167
<i>- I'm at the hotel.</i>
- Chloe there?

16:34.208 --> 16:37.000
Right by my side.

16:37.042 --> 16:39.082
Come over to the houseboat
as soon as you're done.

16:41.917 --> 16:43.666
I gotta take care of something.

16:43.667 --> 16:45.833
Billy Ayers getting attached.

16:45.875 --> 16:50.042
Behave yourself, soppy bollocks.

17:00.833 --> 17:03.875
You don't think I'm
overselling it, do you?

17:03.917 --> 17:06.958
No.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.375
One thing to bear in mind,
the Sheikhs are super fickle.

17:10.416 --> 17:13.000
A year back, Saul spent weeks
trying to fix a deal.

17:13.041 --> 17:15.750
Only to lose it by calling
one of them sir.

17:15.791 --> 17:17.791
Well, what should he
have called him?

17:17.833 --> 17:20.333
Sheikh, Charlie.

17:20.375 --> 17:22.833
Their title is Sheikh.

17:22.875 --> 17:25.833
Once we're done
with these Sheikhs,

17:25.875 --> 17:28.250
um, maybe you and I...

17:28.333 --> 17:29.833
Lord Cavendish and Chloe Koen

17:29.875 --> 17:32.958
here to see Sheikh Zeshan.

17:49.208 --> 17:51.500
I like these Sheikhs.

18:00.167 --> 18:02.666
What's this? Who are you?

18:02.667 --> 18:05.999
Sheikh Zeshan, Chloe Koen.
Pleased to meet you.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.332
Please may I present
Lord Charles Cavendish.

18:09.333 --> 18:11.667
At your service, Sheikh.

18:14.292 --> 18:16.167
So what do you have for me?

18:16.208 --> 18:19.417
More necklaces? Tiaras?

18:19.458 --> 18:21.500
Not another damn Faberge egg.

18:21.583 --> 18:22.958
Better.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.083
Lord Cavendish
has a large holding

18:25.125 --> 18:28.083
of exquisite, one-of-a-kind
gold artifacts.

18:28.125 --> 18:30.708
I have palaces
full of gold artifacts!

18:30.750 --> 18:32.417
I'm getting married
in a few months,

18:32.458 --> 18:35.250
and the princess is not
easily impressed.

18:35.292 --> 18:40.000
I need something, um...
unexpected.

18:41.625 --> 18:43.832
I know exactly what you mean.

18:43.833 --> 18:47.000
Lord Cavendish has
just the thing.

18:47.042 --> 18:50.042
Yes, I do.

18:50.083 --> 18:52.667
Wh... wh... which one
of my many artifacts

18:52.708 --> 18:56.333
did you have
specifically in mind?

18:56.375 --> 18:58.625
The... solid...

18:58.667 --> 19:01.917
24... karat gold...

19:05.500 --> 19:09.417
bathtub.

19:09.458 --> 19:12.917
Imagine it.

19:12.958 --> 19:15.000
Your fiancée.

19:15.042 --> 19:17.250
A soapy lather.

19:17.292 --> 19:20.833
That unmistakable glint.

19:20.875 --> 19:23.000
Bathing in gold

19:23.042 --> 19:25.999
every night.

19:26.000 --> 19:30.333
A glimmer of pure opulence.

19:30.375 --> 19:32.333
Enriching the man

19:32.375 --> 19:35.000
who slips in beside her.

19:37.042 --> 19:38.832
I want one.

19:38.833 --> 19:41.667
What?! You don't have one?!

19:41.708 --> 19:43.625
Of course we have one, Sheikh.

19:43.667 --> 19:45.833
When is delivery?

19:45.917 --> 19:48.166
We fly out to Dubai
tomorrow night.

19:48.167 --> 19:51.458
The price is
10 million pounds sterling.

19:51.500 --> 19:53.458
Blah blah, I like it!
I'll buy it.

19:53.500 --> 19:55.875
Well, you won't be
disappointed, sir...

19:55.917 --> 19:58.500
Sheikh Ze... Zash... Zee...

19:58.542 --> 20:00.792
4:00pm tomorrow,
we'll be in touch

20:00.833 --> 20:02.917
about the location, and your men

20:02.958 --> 20:04.583
can pick up the bath.

20:04.625 --> 20:08.333
Thank you so much,
Sheikh Zeshan.

20:21.708 --> 20:25.458
Throw another log
on for me, love.

20:25.500 --> 20:27.332
Nice day at the beach, darling?

20:27.333 --> 20:30.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
the water was lovely and warm.

20:30.083 --> 20:32.667
Now... now listen,
before you react,

20:32.708 --> 20:35.750
just take a moment.

20:35.792 --> 20:38.333
What have you done, Vic?

20:38.375 --> 20:40.083
I hit a screw.

20:40.125 --> 20:41.875
I don't know why!

20:44.083 --> 20:48.500
You selfish bastard.

20:48.542 --> 20:50.708
You had three months left.

20:50.750 --> 20:53.208
You'll have another 18 months
on your sentence.

20:53.250 --> 20:54.643
I've done enough time
in here, Lil.

20:54.667 --> 20:55.667
I can't do anymore.

20:55.708 --> 20:58.667
No, Vic, no.

20:58.708 --> 21:00.500
Don't you try it.
Don't you dare.

21:00.542 --> 21:01.976
The wheels are in motion.
Gotta go.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.708
- Vic.
<i>- I gotta go, luv.</i>

21:03.792 --> 21:05.000
Vic!

21:07.083 --> 21:08.000
It's time.

21:08.083 --> 21:10.333
I'm gonna fly the nest.

21:10.417 --> 21:13.500
Should we use the same lab
up in Chelmsford?

21:13.583 --> 21:16.917
Nasty zombie meths up there.

21:16.958 --> 21:19.875
Them boys were chewing
their faces off.

21:19.917 --> 21:23.167
Heh. The nastier, the better.

21:23.208 --> 21:25.417
Yeah.

21:36.083 --> 21:37.917
Done deal.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.875
We deliver to the Sheikh
tomorrow afternoon.

21:39.958 --> 21:41.832
Tomorrow... Slow down.
How much does he want?

21:41.833 --> 21:44.125
All of it. He wants all of it!

21:44.167 --> 21:45.666
A ten-million-pound
gold wedding gift.

21:45.667 --> 21:48.083
I mean, money is just
no object to this guy.

21:48.125 --> 21:49.792
So all the gold gone
in one fell swoop?

21:49.833 --> 21:51.167
Ten million quid?
Simple as that?

21:51.250 --> 21:54.000
Well, there is one small catch.

21:54.083 --> 21:58.208
- What catch?
- Yeah.

21:58.250 --> 21:59.458
We have to smelt it first.

21:59.500 --> 22:01.208
Smelt it? Into what?

22:01.250 --> 22:04.458
- A bathtub.
- A solid gold bathtub.

22:04.500 --> 22:06.000
And how we supposed to do that?

22:06.042 --> 22:09.208
Jesus, Al.
We don't have all the answers.

22:22.958 --> 22:24.000
Well?

22:24.042 --> 22:25.832
What do you want?

22:25.833 --> 22:27.375
I dunno.

22:27.458 --> 22:29.083
I guess I just wanted
to sort things out

22:29.125 --> 22:30.458
after this morning.

22:30.500 --> 22:32.625
Nothing to sort out.

22:32.667 --> 22:35.166
We're moving on, right?

22:35.167 --> 22:38.875
Oi, here's the thing.

22:38.917 --> 22:41.667
I'm not the boyfriend type.

22:41.708 --> 22:44.917
I'd be a shit boyfriend
'cause...

22:44.958 --> 22:46.583
I've never actually been one.

22:46.625 --> 22:49.042
What are you talking about?

22:49.083 --> 22:50.518
You know, the guy you call
every day,

22:50.542 --> 22:52.000
the guy you spend
all your time with.

22:52.042 --> 22:54.333
That guy isn't me.

22:54.375 --> 22:56.332
I just wasn't made that way.

22:56.333 --> 22:57.832
What, and you think I am?

22:57.833 --> 23:01.000
Sonny Castillo is dead
in a dumpster.

23:01.042 --> 23:03.999
I'm not the settling down
type either.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.458
I just wanted to get away
from all this shit.

23:06.500 --> 23:08.292
And you were the closest guy
with a six-pack,

23:08.333 --> 23:10.999
a motorbike,
and a bag of diamonds.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.500
So, we good?

23:13.583 --> 23:16.125
Good, bad.
Who gives a shit, right?

23:16.167 --> 23:17.417
Yeah.

23:17.458 --> 23:19.458
Who gives a shit?

23:31.750 --> 23:33.833
So... what's with the big rush?

23:33.875 --> 23:36.083
We've got a buyer lined up
for tomorrow afternoon.

23:36.167 --> 23:38.917
Your traveler mates,
they know how to smelt gold?

23:39.000 --> 23:41.208
Yeah, Uncle Dean.

23:41.250 --> 23:43.208
He'll be the man for the job.

23:43.250 --> 23:45.292
Why are we
smelting gold exactly?

23:45.333 --> 23:46.792
We need to make a gold bath.

23:46.833 --> 23:50.333
A gold bath?

23:50.375 --> 23:52.125
A gold bath?

23:52.167 --> 23:57.000
- Yeah.
- Well...

23:57.083 --> 23:58.417
I made a gold shitter once.

23:58.458 --> 24:00.292
So can you do it?

24:00.333 --> 24:01.917
Can you make a gold bathtub?

24:01.958 --> 24:04.667
Aye.

24:04.708 --> 24:06.042
I'll give it a crack.

24:10.250 --> 24:12.083
Ladies and gentlemen,

24:12.125 --> 24:13.958
ready for the main event.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.708
Contrary to popular belief,

24:16.750 --> 24:20.250
the majority of Travelers
are well-heeled,

24:20.333 --> 24:22.375
hard-working citizens.

24:22.417 --> 24:25.667
True, we enjoy
an alternative lifestyle.

24:25.708 --> 24:29.167
Attempting to evade
the punitive taxes

24:29.208 --> 24:33.375
that a hostile government
imposes upon us.

24:33.458 --> 24:36.083
But never forget

24:36.125 --> 24:37.458
you are amidst

24:37.500 --> 24:40.167
the greatest craftsmen

24:40.250 --> 24:42.250
you have ever seen!

25:04.333 --> 25:06.042
You sure about this, Al?

25:06.083 --> 25:08.125
I am far from sure
about this, Charlie.

25:17.958 --> 25:21.333
Horse shit and wood ash.

25:21.417 --> 25:22.958
Nature's crucible.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.708
Sure, it has to withstand
temperatures

25:24.750 --> 25:27.667
of 1,950 degrees Fahrenheit.

25:27.708 --> 25:29.625
I have the young'uns on the job,

25:29.667 --> 25:32.000
bringing it to the boil.

25:34.583 --> 25:37.250
In our little community,

25:37.292 --> 25:39.042
when there's a job worth doing,

25:39.083 --> 25:41.417
we all muck in.

25:41.500 --> 25:45.375
So... start digging,

25:45.417 --> 25:46.833
ya ballicks!

26:01.792 --> 26:04.292
The girls have fashioned you
a beautiful bath

26:04.333 --> 26:05.708
made entirely from wax.

26:05.750 --> 26:06.833
Won't it melt?

26:06.875 --> 26:08.708
That's the whole idea, darlin'.

26:08.750 --> 26:11.042
Lost wax casting.

26:11.083 --> 26:13.125
It's in the name.

26:28.167 --> 26:29.917
Come on, girls!

26:34.333 --> 26:36.875
Hey!

26:36.958 --> 26:39.332
Time is a 'wasting!

26:39.333 --> 26:40.499
Ready to pour?

26:40.500 --> 26:41.750
Ready so.

26:41.792 --> 26:44.000
Alchemists and metallurgists

26:44.083 --> 26:46.500
have been in our family
for generations.

26:46.583 --> 26:49.125
Millennia.

26:49.167 --> 26:51.000
We have taken our skills

26:51.042 --> 26:52.833
east to China,

26:52.875 --> 26:55.250
south to Egypt,

26:55.292 --> 26:58.250
and all across
the Holy Roman Empire

26:58.292 --> 27:00.041
until this place

27:00.042 --> 27:02.542
at this time.

27:02.583 --> 27:05.167
But never...

27:05.208 --> 27:08.083
has an outsider

27:08.167 --> 27:09.333
been witness to our magic.

27:16.792 --> 27:20.166
Tonight, tis your honor

27:20.167 --> 27:22.166
to pop the cherry.

27:22.167 --> 27:23.167
Pop whose cherry?

27:34.042 --> 27:36.208
One clean strike.

28:18.542 --> 28:21.708
So... what happens now?

28:21.750 --> 28:24.458
Well... now...

28:24.500 --> 28:26.792
we get twatted.

28:26.833 --> 28:29.333
'Cause there's nothing
we can do till the morning.

29:00.333 --> 29:02.833
It's a painful proposition

29:02.875 --> 29:04.875
being human.

29:07.167 --> 29:09.500
From the moment
we leave the womb...

29:11.667 --> 29:16.167
we're at the mercy
of the oppressors...

29:16.208 --> 29:19.292
the lecherous...

29:19.333 --> 29:21.333
the inhumane.

29:26.167 --> 29:29.250
It's a wonder...

29:29.292 --> 29:32.583
a miracle really...

29:32.625 --> 29:34.583
that one ever achieves

29:34.625 --> 29:37.625
any peace at all.

29:40.458 --> 29:43.458
Eat up, boys.
We're here all night.

29:47.500 --> 29:49.667
All right, so let's...

29:49.708 --> 29:52.832
open her up,
take her clothes off,

29:52.833 --> 29:54.750
and see her naked.

29:56.042 --> 29:57.042
Whoa!

30:09.292 --> 30:12.750
And come on!

30:14.958 --> 30:16.958
Aah!

30:46.042 --> 30:48.542
Sheikh's here, Charlie.

30:48.625 --> 30:50.125
Okay.

30:50.167 --> 30:52.167
Okay, stay calm.

31:04.042 --> 31:06.042
Hello, Sheikh Zeshan.

31:10.042 --> 31:11.708
Why did we have to come here?

31:11.750 --> 31:12.917
No showroom?

31:12.958 --> 31:15.332
For such a high-priced item,

31:15.333 --> 31:17.999
we deliver on-site
for insurance purposes.

31:18.000 --> 31:21.417
I have a plane to catch.
Where is this bath?

31:21.500 --> 31:23.792
I'll have it brought
around now, Sheikh.

31:34.333 --> 31:36.333
We're on.

31:39.417 --> 31:40.875
Where the hell is it?!

31:40.917 --> 31:43.417
I should have just
bought her another yacht.

31:43.458 --> 31:45.500
Here it is now, Sheikh.

31:50.708 --> 31:52.750
Who are these two?

31:52.792 --> 31:55.708
Th... Th... These are just
my delivery men, Sheikh.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.125
I like it.

32:17.167 --> 32:19.500
It's unique.

32:19.583 --> 32:22.042
Does the bird come
with the bath?

32:22.083 --> 32:23.458
What did you say?

32:39.500 --> 32:41.375
What is this?

32:41.417 --> 32:43.500
I'm a mediator.

32:43.542 --> 32:47.208
Engaged to make sure
all parties are satisfied.

32:47.292 --> 32:49.833
Nothing to be
concerned about, Sheikh.

32:49.875 --> 32:54.417
Shall we, complete
the, transaction, Sheikh?

32:54.458 --> 32:56.499
This is a lot of force
for a bathroom fixture.

32:56.500 --> 32:58.166
Bathroom fixture?

32:58.167 --> 33:02.332
This is a 24-karat,
handmade gold bath, mate.

33:02.333 --> 33:04.875
With all due respect, Sheikh,

33:04.917 --> 33:07.375
this is an exquisite piece.

33:07.417 --> 33:10.042
As my assistant here
plainly pointed out,

33:10.083 --> 33:11.792
this is a 24-karat bath.

33:11.833 --> 33:13.167
A collector's item.

33:13.208 --> 33:16.917
Handmade by the finest artisans.

33:21.417 --> 33:24.708
Well, there are other...

33:24.750 --> 33:26.833
people interested.

33:32.792 --> 33:34.542
I'll take it, I'll take it.

33:34.625 --> 33:36.417
If you could transfer
the agreed funds...

33:36.458 --> 33:40.250
- Ring it up.
- Okay.

33:40.292 --> 33:45.167
- Yes, 2-5-3-6-7-1...
- Zero.

33:45.208 --> 33:47.917
- 6...
- Zero zero.

33:47.958 --> 33:51.708
Albert Hill!

33:51.750 --> 33:54.125
You've been a naughty boy.

33:56.500 --> 33:58.375
Yalla, let's go, let's go!

34:00.875 --> 34:04.208
No, no, no, no, no! Shit!

34:16.000 --> 34:18.667
Up and at 'em, boys!

34:24.167 --> 34:26.167
Fink!

34:35.292 --> 34:38.292
Well, come on then!

34:51.667 --> 34:53.498
Chloe!

34:53.500 --> 34:55.500
Don't you touch her!

35:22.125 --> 35:24.500
Aah!

35:30.167 --> 35:32.167
Whoa!

35:51.667 --> 35:53.958
Are you prepare to shoot
a man of the cloth

35:54.000 --> 35:55.667
for material gains?

35:55.708 --> 35:58.250
Yeah.

35:58.292 --> 36:00.625
In a heartbeat.

36:09.875 --> 36:11.833
Get in!

36:14.667 --> 36:16.167
Go, go, go, go, go!

36:21.792 --> 36:23.917
Fuck!

36:23.958 --> 36:25.792
Fuck!

36:41.250 --> 36:43.667
We need to get out of town.
There's way too much heat.

36:43.708 --> 36:45.792
My family's place
in the country.

36:45.833 --> 36:47.625
Straight up the M1,
it's perfect.

36:47.667 --> 36:48.999
Well, I hope
it's comfy, Charlie,

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
'cause we might be there
for a while.

37:02.375 --> 37:04.333
Aah!

37:14.083 --> 37:15.667
Aah!

37:27.708 --> 37:29.833
To the brim?

37:32.708 --> 37:34.499
Everything okay?

37:34.500 --> 37:36.083
Yes, Norman, fine.

37:36.167 --> 37:38.166
Thinking about Vic?

37:38.167 --> 37:41.500
Amongst other things.

37:41.542 --> 37:44.332
So... he's on the countdown.

37:44.333 --> 37:46.042
Three months and he's home...

37:46.125 --> 37:48.245
I don't know, Norman.
What's with all the questions?

37:49.792 --> 37:52.167
You worried gonna have to start
cooking for yourself again?

37:55.917 --> 37:59.875
Sorry, that was a little strong.

38:02.500 --> 38:04.875
While I was convalescing,

38:04.917 --> 38:07.000
I was remembering the times
you'd cook me and Vic

38:07.042 --> 38:09.458
a fry-up after a job.

38:09.500 --> 38:12.542
Always at some ungodly hour.

38:12.583 --> 38:14.417
We'd polish off a bottle or two.

38:14.500 --> 38:18.000
Vic would be snoring
on the sofa, and...

38:18.042 --> 38:19.958
you and I would talk and...

38:20.000 --> 38:22.999
and giggle till it got light.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.708
Having a laugh.

38:27.500 --> 38:29.167
Yeah, they were
good times, Norman.

38:30.833 --> 38:31.833
For all of us.

38:35.167 --> 38:37.500
Who is it?

38:37.542 --> 38:39.750
Police!

38:39.792 --> 38:40.750
Open up
or we'll put the door in.

38:40.792 --> 38:42.792
No need for that.

38:46.583 --> 38:49.125
Lily Hill, you alone?

38:54.208 --> 38:57.832
Firstly, you know
exactly who I am,

38:57.833 --> 38:59.499
and secondly,
of course I'm on my own.

38:59.500 --> 39:01.667
You put my husband behind bars.

39:01.708 --> 39:03.167
We have reason to believe

39:03.208 --> 39:05.166
you're in possession
of illegal firearms.

39:05.167 --> 39:07.542
Up to your old tricks
again, Bob?

39:12.500 --> 39:15.333
Oi, be careful with my things!

39:15.417 --> 39:17.417
Come on!

39:38.333 --> 39:41.000
- Find anything?
- Nothing here, sir.

39:41.042 --> 39:42.666
All right, well, check in there.

39:42.667 --> 39:46.125
- Done, checked, it's...
- Check again.

40:02.000 --> 40:05.500
Sir!

40:05.542 --> 40:08.167
I found something.

40:08.208 --> 40:11.500
For Christ sakes!

40:11.542 --> 40:13.167
Lily Hill, I'm arresting you

40:13.208 --> 40:14.809
on suspicion of possessing
Prohibited Weapons

40:14.833 --> 40:17.832
defined by Section Five
of the Firearms Act, 1968,

40:17.833 --> 40:19.208
You do not have to say anything,

40:19.250 --> 40:20.667
but it may it harm your defense

40:20.708 --> 40:22.208
if you do not mention
my questioned

40:22.250 --> 40:23.726
something which you later
rely on in court.

40:23.750 --> 40:26.332
Anything you do say may be
given in evidence.

40:26.333 --> 40:28.667
All right?

40:32.042 --> 40:33.999
Off we go. Two pair.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.333
- Full house.
- Mmph!

40:35.417 --> 40:38.250
- Deal me again.
- Right, why, you up?

40:38.292 --> 40:40.458
Can I get involved?

40:40.500 --> 40:44.375
There is a minimum stake.

40:44.417 --> 40:46.417
Will these do?

40:49.000 --> 40:50.958
White chocolate.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.375
My favorite.

40:55.875 --> 40:57.792
Nice bit of shopping, Smudger.

40:57.833 --> 40:59.375
That's for you.

40:59.417 --> 41:01.333
I can smell the fresh air
already, Vic.

41:01.375 --> 41:04.542
- Good boy.
- Cheers, Mr. H.

41:08.625 --> 41:10.708
Whose house did you say
this was again, Charlie?

41:10.792 --> 41:12.375
My cousin Monty.

41:12.458 --> 41:14.833
Where exactly is Cousin Monty?

41:14.917 --> 41:16.625
Zurich, last I heard.

41:16.667 --> 41:18.958
Might have run a bit afoul
with the Inland Revenue.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.292
Naughty, naughty Cousin Monty.

41:34.083 --> 41:36.083
In we go.

41:38.083 --> 41:40.833
They leave the keys to this
place under the plant pot?

41:43.250 --> 41:45.167
You know, rich people shit.
