It's a five-drink minimum
to calm the nerves.

36:20.856 --> 36:22.256
Do you want one?
No, I need to know

36:22.324 --> 36:25.426
if the passports can still
get us out of the country.

36:25.494 --> 36:27.328
[ Clears throat ]

36:27.396 --> 36:28.996
Let me -- let me ask you
something first.

36:29.064 --> 36:30.665
Schmidt --
just...

36:30.732 --> 36:35.937
You knew that Vanek
wanted to torture me,

36:36.004 --> 36:38.005
kill me,
torture me some more.

36:38.073 --> 36:41.175
So, were you -- were you
really gonna hand me over

36:41.243 --> 36:43.077
to that animal?

36:43.145 --> 36:46.747
I needed you
to think I was.

36:46.815 --> 36:49.083
Vanek had to see real fear
in your eyes,

36:49.151 --> 36:51.118
otherwise he wouldn't
move his men

36:51.186 --> 36:52.820
over towards
the transformer.

36:52.888 --> 36:55.156
Wow. Really?

36:55.224 --> 36:57.792
I'm not saying
it wasn't a long shot.

36:57.860 --> 37:00.061
[ Chuckles ]

37:00.128 --> 37:05.566
What you're saying
is that you have X-ray vision.

37:05.634 --> 37:09.403
Because there's no way
you could have known

37:09.471 --> 37:13.641
that that transformer was there
when you marched me out.

37:13.709 --> 37:16.010
If it wasn't
the transformer,

37:16.078 --> 37:17.512
it would have been
something else.

37:17.579 --> 37:21.449
I needed to make an opening
for Jesse to get his truck in.

37:21.517 --> 37:24.652
You can say all that
with a straight face.

37:24.720 --> 37:27.655
Wow. You're good.
You're good.

37:27.723 --> 37:30.291
Is that
the same load of crap

37:30.359 --> 37:32.426
that you shovel down
your team's throat?

37:38.467 --> 37:43.404
All anyone needs to know is
that I didn't want you to die,

37:43.472 --> 37:45.239
and you didn't die.

37:45.307 --> 37:48.376
Schmidt. The passports.

37:50.145 --> 37:52.780
Are -- they're good.
They're good.

37:52.848 --> 37:56.250
But I wouldn't, uh,
sit on them for too long.

37:56.318 --> 37:57.752
If Vanek gets swept up
by the Feds,

37:57.819 --> 38:00.488
they're gonna become
radioactive.

38:00.556 --> 38:03.057
I-I got a -- I got a guy in --
in Morocco that can set a new --

38:03.125 --> 38:06.060
I'd prefer not to work
with your associates.

38:06.128 --> 38:07.328
No offense.
[ Chuckles ]

38:07.396 --> 38:10.698
I'm sure once you get set up
in Argentina,

38:10.766 --> 38:13.568
you can use your voodoo magic
to lay low.

38:13.635 --> 38:16.103
You should go somewhere,
too.

38:17.339 --> 38:18.673
Yeah, no kidding.

38:18.740 --> 38:22.076
I'm -- I'm -- I'm gonna, uh,
blow this hellhole tonight.

38:22.144 --> 38:27.181
Um, feel -- feel free to use
the house, uh, until you leave.

38:27.249 --> 38:31.085
It's a -- think of it as
a "I'm sorry" gift.

38:31.153 --> 38:33.955
Where do you think
you'll go?

38:34.022 --> 38:36.324
[ Chuckles ]
Find a globe, you know?

38:36.391 --> 38:38.693
What-- whatever side of it
you're on,

38:38.760 --> 38:41.662
I'm gonna be on
the opposite side, you know.

38:41.730 --> 38:44.532
You -- you saved my life,
and I'm thankful.

38:44.600 --> 38:46.934
[ Chuckling ]
But I get the feeling

38:47.002 --> 38:49.403
I-if I hang out with you
much longer,

38:49.471 --> 38:51.105
my luck's gonna run out.

38:51.173 --> 38:52.840
[ Clears throat ]

38:56.211 --> 38:58.779
You take care of yourself,
Schmidt.

39:08.824 --> 39:10.491
We got a problem, Mike.

39:10.559 --> 39:12.994
One of the cars is missing,
and I can't find your mom.

39:13.061 --> 39:15.162
What? Where'd she go?

39:15.230 --> 39:17.264
I have
a pretty good idea.

39:17.332 --> 39:20.001
[ Birds chirping ]

39:26.575 --> 39:28.709
You can spare me
the lecture.

39:28.777 --> 39:32.146
Jesse already told me
it's too risky to come here.

39:32.214 --> 39:34.515
But I had to.

39:34.583 --> 39:36.550
It's okay.

39:36.618 --> 39:38.886
You needed
to say goodbye.

39:38.954 --> 39:42.356
If the CIA were here,
they'd have moved in already.

39:46.361 --> 39:48.763
[ Sighs ]

39:48.830 --> 39:51.832
After you left home,

39:51.900 --> 39:55.469
Nate promised
to take me away from Miami.

39:58.306 --> 40:00.307
He was such a big dreamer,
you know.

40:00.375 --> 40:01.609
He wanted to go to --

40:01.677 --> 40:04.345
walk the pyramids
and ski the Alps.

40:08.016 --> 40:10.785
He just wanted to go
so badly.

40:14.222 --> 40:17.391
Anyway, it just doesn't seem
right leaving him here alone.

40:17.459 --> 40:20.127
He wanted to take you
to a better place, Ma.

40:20.195 --> 40:22.530
He wanted you safe.

40:22.597 --> 40:25.966
He wanted you
to smile again.

40:26.034 --> 40:29.870
Let me keep that promise.

40:29.938 --> 40:32.673
I owe it to you
and to Nate.

40:35.043 --> 40:38.379
That's pretty flowers.

40:39.681 --> 40:41.382
I didn't bring them.

40:41.450 --> 40:43.584
A friend of Nate's
must have come by earlier.

40:49.691 --> 40:52.359
Hey, mom, will you give me
a minute alone?

40:52.427 --> 40:54.161
I'll be right behind you.

40:54.229 --> 40:56.030
Sure.

40:56.098 --> 40:59.200
Take your time.
