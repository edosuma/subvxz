00:10.109 --> 00:13.211
Did I get any beer on you?
Sorry, lady. Hey!

00:13.212 --> 00:15.647
It's autumn.
The leaves are changing.

00:15.648 --> 00:18.950
The weather's changing.
Brr.

00:18.951 --> 00:22.386
The only thing
that's not changing
is al's personality.

00:22.387 --> 00:24.388
My fan mail,

00:24.389 --> 00:27.659
Which, incidentally,
exceeds yours by ten to one,

00:27.660 --> 00:30.695
Indicates that people like me
just about the way I am.

00:30.696 --> 00:32.897
<i>(cheering)</i>

Ten to one, al, huh?
Ten to one.

00:38.403 --> 00:41.272
Your mom must be getting
writer's cramp.

00:44.576 --> 00:47.578
Ok, it's autumn.
What else is it time for, al?

00:47.579 --> 00:49.247
It's time for Halloween,

00:49.248 --> 00:52.250
When you try to scare me with
one of your childish tricks.

00:52.251 --> 00:54.252
I don't have time for that.

00:54.253 --> 00:57.255
Today, we're talking about
something real interesting -
backyard refuse.

00:57.256 --> 01:00.558
So I don't have to worry
about some bloody body part
popping out at me?

01:00.559 --> 01:03.394
Not unless it's yours.

01:03.395 --> 01:05.229
Thank you, tim.

01:05.230 --> 01:07.732
Well, mulching is the quickest
and most effective way

01:07.733 --> 01:10.368
To deal with those
unsightly piles
of leaves and twigs

01:10.369 --> 01:12.203
That clutter up your yard.

01:12.204 --> 01:15.040
Not to mention you get to
crank up a noisy machine

01:15.041 --> 01:17.475
And grind up stuff.

01:17.476 --> 01:19.377
Depending on your mulcher,

01:19.378 --> 01:23.148
You can throw in
just about anything
your yard will grow.

01:23.149 --> 01:24.749
<i>(starts engine)</i>

01:24.750 --> 01:26.517
Leaves.

01:30.156 --> 01:31.422
Twigs.

01:37.396 --> 01:40.965
Or how about al's paycheck?

01:42.935 --> 01:45.970
Then you get
to the bigger stuff.

01:45.971 --> 01:48.206
Patio furniture,
canoes, old doors.

01:48.207 --> 01:50.374
Your entire deck can go
in here.

01:50.375 --> 01:53.377
That's exactly what you don't
want to put in your mulcher.

01:53.378 --> 01:55.580
It could clog it up.
That's right.

01:55.581 --> 01:58.583
That's why
we have this other mulcher
to show you what happens

01:58.584 --> 02:00.585
When you get
a clogged-up beater bar.

02:00.586 --> 02:02.754
Now, when you clear out
the beater bar,

02:02.755 --> 02:05.690
You wanna make sure
the whole unit's shut off
because...

02:05.691 --> 02:07.458
<i>(both)</i> safety first.

02:07.459 --> 02:11.096
That's right. Now,
you can just clear away
the refuse here,

02:11.097 --> 02:13.397
Get down
into the beater bar...

02:17.236 --> 02:19.403
Happy Halloween, al.

03:12.524 --> 03:14.725
<i>(tim)</i> hey, guys.
Hey, tim.

03:14.726 --> 03:16.727
Hey, harry,
how are you feeling?

03:16.728 --> 03:19.898
Good as new. My doctor
said the best thing to do
after a heart attack

03:19.899 --> 03:21.900
Is surround yourself
with loved ones.

03:21.901 --> 03:24.468
So you left your wife home
and came to the store.

03:24.469 --> 03:26.504
<i>(laughs)</i> you got it.

03:26.505 --> 03:28.006
Hey, benny.
Hey, timmy.

03:28.007 --> 03:30.675
You're always here.
I thought you had
a new job.

03:30.676 --> 03:32.677
I decided
to leave that position.

03:32.678 --> 03:35.379
He was fired.
Which made it easy
for me to leave.

03:35.380 --> 03:38.582
I got your note at <i>tool time.</i>
What's the problem?

03:38.583 --> 03:41.352
Oh, the opportunity
of a lifetime.

03:41.353 --> 03:44.588
How would you like
to be part owner
of harry's hardware?

03:44.589 --> 03:47.758
<i>(grunts)</i>

03:47.759 --> 03:48.927
Me?
Yeah.

03:48.928 --> 03:50.494
Really?
Yeah.

03:50.495 --> 03:53.698
It's a dream come true.
Have I died and gone to heaven?

03:55.600 --> 03:58.837
Anyway, my brother larry wants
to sell his 20% share,

03:58.838 --> 04:03.374
So for $15,000
you could be my silent partner.

04:03.375 --> 04:07.278
<i>(garbled)</i> hey, how come
you didn't ask me?

04:07.279 --> 04:08.880
What?
What?

04:10.983 --> 04:13.952
How come
you didn't ask me?

04:13.953 --> 04:17.322
Benny,
you gotta have some money.

04:17.322 --> 04:19.023
Oh, yeah. Money.

04:20.326 --> 04:23.294
What about me?
I have money.

04:23.295 --> 04:26.564
But you gotta be willing
to withdraw it from
your mattress, al.

04:28.033 --> 04:30.835
It's not in my mattress.
Oh, cut it out.

04:30.836 --> 04:33.704
Wait. You're saying
you're interested, al?

04:33.705 --> 04:35.439
Well, yeah.

04:35.440 --> 04:39.577
I mean, $15,000, that's...
That's a lot of money,

04:39.578 --> 04:41.412
But on the other hand,

04:41.413 --> 04:44.415
It's always been a dream of mine
to own a hardware store.

04:44.416 --> 04:47.418
It's also been a dream of yours
to walk around your mom

04:47.419 --> 04:49.287
Without taking a rest stop.

04:49.288 --> 04:51.923
<i>(benny and harry laughing)</i>

04:51.924 --> 04:54.225
I'm just kidding, al.

05:08.573 --> 05:10.241
<i>(both)</i> boo!

05:11.777 --> 05:15.579
Did you guys do something
different to your hair?

05:15.580 --> 05:18.616
See? I told you
you weren't ugly enough
to scare anybody.

05:18.617 --> 05:21.619
You're totally ugly.
I'm just used to you.

05:23.188 --> 05:27.191
Mom, you think I have a chance
at winning the costume contest?

05:27.192 --> 05:29.693
I don't have enough brains
oozing out of my head.

05:29.694 --> 05:32.630
I didn't know you had
any brains in your head.

05:32.631 --> 05:35.900
How would you like it
if I made you look
like you're really dead?

05:35.901 --> 05:38.136
Boys, boys,
will you just relax?

05:38.137 --> 05:40.638
I think mark's gonna
win the contest anyway.

05:40.639 --> 05:43.074
Mark? <i>(scoffs)</i> no way.

05:43.075 --> 05:44.375
Well?

05:53.218 --> 05:56.620
Well, if he's al, I guess
that makes you al's mom?

06:00.326 --> 06:02.427
I don't think so, brad.

06:02.428 --> 06:05.830
Y'ello! Happy Halloween. Boo.
<i>(jill)</i> hi.

06:07.433 --> 06:10.068
Boy, al, you gotta stay
outta the dryer.

06:11.636 --> 06:14.805
Looking good, guys.
Looking good.
Guys, go wash up.

06:14.806 --> 06:17.508
Brad, don't forget to wash
behind your brains.

06:19.578 --> 06:22.013
Well, I got the goodies
for the kids

06:22.014 --> 06:23.581
And I got a little
something special for you.

06:23.582 --> 06:24.983
What?

06:24.984 --> 06:26.517
<i>(gasps)</i>

06:26.518 --> 06:28.686
Chocolate-covered
marshmallow pumpkins?

06:28.687 --> 06:31.689
I didn't know
they made these anymore.
Where did you find them?

06:31.690 --> 06:34.092
Little candy store
in windsor.

06:34.093 --> 06:37.362
You drove to canada
to get me these?

06:37.363 --> 06:41.932
Aw, shucks. I'd drive to europe
if it would put a little smile
on your face.

06:44.336 --> 06:47.171
What do you want?

06:47.172 --> 06:48.839
It's like this.

06:48.840 --> 06:51.842
You know how me buying that
put a little smile on your face?

06:51.843 --> 06:53.844
There's something
I'd like to buy

06:53.845 --> 06:56.014
That would put a big smile
on my face.

06:56.015 --> 06:59.884
What would that be?
A hardware store.

06:59.885 --> 07:02.620
Take the candy back
to canada.

07:02.621 --> 07:05.123
Listen, look,
for a mere 15 grand

07:05.124 --> 07:07.825
We can own 20%
of harry's hardware.

07:07.826 --> 07:12.163
And while you're in canada,
you can file for citizenship.

07:12.164 --> 07:14.065
This is a surefire investment.

07:14.066 --> 07:17.235
That's what you said when
you invested all our money
in the hot rod.

07:17.236 --> 07:18.769
Wait a minute.

07:18.770 --> 07:21.972
That hot rod has gained value
every single day.

07:21.973 --> 07:24.675
Great. Then sell the hot rod
and buy a hardware store.

07:24.676 --> 07:27.445
I am not selling
the hot rod. <i>(grunts)</i>

07:27.446 --> 07:29.180
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>
after this is over...

07:29.181 --> 07:31.182
No way!
...We're talking
about this.

07:31.183 --> 07:33.918
Al and ilene, hi!
I hope
we're not intruding.

07:33.919 --> 07:37.555
We were just on our way to
the Sunday early bird special
at corky's coffee shop.

07:37.556 --> 07:39.890
We've done it every Sunday
since we met.

07:39.891 --> 07:43.194
We get the same table,
al orders the meat loaf,
I get the chicken cutlet,

07:43.195 --> 07:45.863
And halfway through the meal
we switch.

07:45.864 --> 07:48.599
God, and they say
romance is dead.

07:49.968 --> 07:51.969
You guys want a drink?

07:51.970 --> 07:54.772
No, we get unlimited coffee
with the special.

07:54.773 --> 07:56.340
Well, what's up?

07:56.341 --> 07:57.808
I stopped by to find out,

07:57.809 --> 07:59.810
Are you going to invest
in harry's hardware?

07:59.811 --> 08:02.780
It's a possibility.
It's completely
out of the question.

08:02.781 --> 08:04.982
We're still
discussing it.
Over my dead body.

08:04.983 --> 08:07.952
She's on the fence.

08:07.953 --> 08:11.255
Because if you don't invest,
I will.

08:11.256 --> 08:13.591
You part with money?
Last time you tried that,

08:13.592 --> 08:16.127
You jumped
in the wishing well
to get your money back.

08:16.128 --> 08:18.963
I'll have you know
that I once owned
and operated

08:18.964 --> 08:21.365
A very successful
business venture.

08:21.366 --> 08:22.866
Did you really?

08:22.867 --> 08:24.935
I had no idea.
Neither did I.

08:24.936 --> 08:27.538
Little al's
lemonade stand.

08:27.539 --> 08:29.873
My slogan was,

08:29.874 --> 08:32.977
"when it comes to lemons,
I'm your main squeeze."

08:32.977 --> 08:34.812
Oh, al.

08:34.813 --> 08:37.347
Even as a little boy,
you were so clever.

08:37.349 --> 08:39.850
Well, we're just
clevered out with you, al,

08:39.851 --> 08:41.852
We really are, but...

08:41.852 --> 08:44.155
Jill and I
still need a little time

08:44.155 --> 08:46.690
To talk about putting money
into this hardware...

08:46.691 --> 08:47.691
Time's up.

08:47.692 --> 08:49.660
Congratulations, al.

08:49.661 --> 08:52.062
You got yourself
a hardware store.

08:54.833 --> 08:56.601
Hey, al.
Good morning,
benny.

08:56.602 --> 08:58.802
Harry. Oh, hi, tim.
Hello, al.

08:58.803 --> 09:02.340
Oh, there he is.
How's my new silent partner?

09:02.341 --> 09:06.877
Well, harry, I'm filled
with a renewed sense
of who al borland is

09:06.878 --> 09:11.282
And who he has
the potential
to blossom into.

09:11.283 --> 09:13.217
Sorry I asked.

09:14.886 --> 09:16.887
So, the old lemonade tycoon.

09:16.888 --> 09:18.922
What are you doing,
checking up on your investment?

09:18.923 --> 09:22.293
Nah. No, no, no.
Harry doesn't need me
to help him run this place.

09:22.294 --> 09:24.728
Just, uh, pretend
like I'm not here.

09:24.729 --> 09:26.964
Comes naturally to me, al.

09:29.701 --> 09:31.802
What's that?

09:31.803 --> 09:34.238
Well, I thought
I'd keep the freeloaders

09:34.239 --> 09:36.541
From coming in here
and drinking all our coffee.

09:36.542 --> 09:38.976
Good idea.

09:38.977 --> 09:43.214
Benny, I believe the freeloaders
he's talking about is you.

09:43.215 --> 09:46.417
Get outta here.

09:46.418 --> 09:48.586
I'm just saying
that to be fair,

09:48.587 --> 09:50.954
Everybody should pay 50 cents
for their coffee.

09:50.955 --> 09:55.426
Al, lighten up.

09:55.427 --> 09:57.461
Hey, I'm no freeloader.

09:57.462 --> 10:00.198
I'll buy my own coffee.

10:00.199 --> 10:04.268
Harry, can I bum 50 cents?
Sure thing.

10:04.269 --> 10:07.004
Here you go, benny.
Here you go, al.

10:07.005 --> 10:09.307
Here you go, harry.
Thanks, al.

10:15.581 --> 10:18.015
Well, al,
financial moves like that,

10:18.016 --> 10:20.251
You'll be bankrupt in a week.

10:20.252 --> 10:24.422
But you could throw yourself
a benefit concert - "lemon aid."

10:27.259 --> 10:30.261
Yes. If you're just getting
leaves out of your gutters,

10:30.262 --> 10:32.263
All you need
is these extensions,

10:32.264 --> 10:34.298
And I recommend
these t4-70 series.

10:34.299 --> 10:36.967
I'll take two of them, then.
What's it gonna cost?

10:36.968 --> 10:39.970
Oh, for you?
You're my best customer.
I'll tell you what.

10:39.971 --> 10:42.506
Give me a couple of tickets
to <i>tool time,</i>

10:42.507 --> 10:44.675
And I'll give 'em to you
at cost.

10:44.676 --> 10:47.010
I'll give you two
on the aisle.

10:47.011 --> 10:49.780
Uh, harry, can, um...

10:49.781 --> 10:52.216
Can we have
a little business meeting?

10:52.217 --> 10:54.952
Sure.
Step into my office.

10:54.953 --> 10:56.987
Ok, what is it?

10:58.557 --> 11:01.024
Well, I'm just thinking
that, um,

11:01.025 --> 11:03.861
If we sell everything at cost,
we won't make a profit.

11:03.862 --> 11:08.766
Well, I'm just saying that
if we give tim a discount,
where does it stop?

11:08.767 --> 11:11.736
Your relatives?
My relatives?

11:11.737 --> 11:12.970
Benny?

11:12.971 --> 11:15.139
You don't have to
worry about me.

11:15.140 --> 11:17.975
I never buy anything.

11:17.976 --> 11:19.977
Al, um...
Excuse me, al, but...

11:19.978 --> 11:24.014
May I remind you that
I spend more here in a month
than most people do in a year?

11:24.015 --> 11:26.917
Well, tim,
business is business.

11:26.918 --> 11:29.052
Maybe I'll take my business
someplace else.

11:29.053 --> 11:31.656
Al, you trying to give me
another heart attack?

11:31.657 --> 11:33.691
Let's give him the discount.

11:33.692 --> 11:36.427
Harry, I didn't make a killing
at little al's lemonade stand

11:36.428 --> 11:38.262
By slashing my prices.

11:38.263 --> 11:42.166
Well, I still own 80%
of this hardware store,

11:42.167 --> 11:46.370
And tim... <i>(laughs)</i>
gets a discount.

11:46.371 --> 11:48.906
Thank you, big harry.
Sorry, little al.

11:53.077 --> 11:57.748
Does everybody know
what time it is?
<i>Tool time!</i>

11:57.749 --> 12:00.751
That's right. Now here he is,
the star of the show,

12:00.752 --> 12:03.721
Tim "the tool man" taylor!
Whoo-hoo!

12:03.722 --> 12:05.389
<i>(cheering)</i>

12:06.891 --> 12:10.127
Thank you, everybody.
Thank you, heidi.

12:10.128 --> 12:12.129
And welcome to <i>tool time.</i>

12:12.130 --> 12:14.131
I am
tim "the tool man" taylor,

12:14.132 --> 12:17.768
And you all know my assistant
al "the living lemon" borland.

12:19.471 --> 12:21.972
Today, we're gonna show you
how to hang a picture

12:21.973 --> 12:23.674
On a hollow wall.

12:23.675 --> 12:25.543
"hollo," wall.

12:25.544 --> 12:27.211
You're such a stud.

12:27.212 --> 12:29.647
<i>(fake laugh)</i>

12:29.648 --> 12:32.650
Ok, let's say we're al
scampering around
our apartment

12:32.651 --> 12:35.653
Putting up
our favorite picture.

12:35.654 --> 12:40.424
There we go.
Now, when this hap...

12:40.425 --> 12:43.861
The reason that this happened
is because the hollow wall here

12:43.862 --> 12:46.597
Is not strong enough
to support the weight.

12:46.598 --> 12:48.799
For that
you need a wall anchor.

12:48.800 --> 12:51.034
There are many types
of wall anchors.
Right.

12:51.035 --> 12:54.438
You got
your hollow wall anchor,
plastic anchor, sleeve anchor,

12:54.439 --> 12:59.243
And if you're in that
easy-listening mood,
I'd go with paul anka.

12:59.244 --> 13:02.546
Which one you choose depends
on the weight of your picture.

13:02.547 --> 13:06.016
For this one here I would go
with a 3/4-inch plastic-lipped
screw anchor.

13:06.017 --> 13:08.285
These are available
at any local hardware store.

13:08.286 --> 13:12.356
That's right.
I like to buy mine
at... Harry's hardware.

13:12.357 --> 13:16.126
Third, near main and royal oak.
Tell them that al sent you.

13:16.127 --> 13:19.129
We'll be right back
with more of al's commercial

13:19.130 --> 13:21.499
After a few words
from our <i>show.</i>

13:21.500 --> 13:24.502
All right. Now,
for this particular anchor

13:24.503 --> 13:27.571
What you wanna do
is first drill a hole,

13:27.572 --> 13:31.208
Then you want to set your anchor
with your hammer.

13:31.209 --> 13:35.713
All right.
Quickly use a screw.
Screw it in like that.

13:35.714 --> 13:39.450
<i>(driver whines)</i>
oh, oh, oh, oh!

13:39.451 --> 13:44.154
Then we're ready to hang
a magnificent piece of art.

13:44.155 --> 13:46.189
Ahh.

13:50.295 --> 13:54.064
Isn't it beautiful?
Mona borland.

13:54.065 --> 13:56.099
Now, you've all heard
of monet.

13:56.100 --> 13:59.904
This is what we call
a "don't waste your monet."

14:01.372 --> 14:02.740
It's funny.

14:02.741 --> 14:06.310
If you wanna save some monet,
shop at harry's hardware.

14:06.311 --> 14:08.312
Our prices are unbeatable,

14:08.313 --> 14:11.582
And for our spanish-speaking
customers, <i>se habla español.</i>

14:13.051 --> 14:14.217
Alberto?

14:14.218 --> 14:16.019
<i>Uno momento.</i>

14:16.020 --> 14:18.088
I also wanna say
that at harry's hardware,

14:18.089 --> 14:20.324
Even tim "the tool man" taylor
shops there.

14:20.325 --> 14:22.326
Tell 'em how you're wild
about harry's.

14:22.327 --> 14:24.862
Wild. It's you
I'm not that crazy about.

14:24.863 --> 14:28.231
We'll be right back
after a few messages
from binford tools,

14:28.232 --> 14:30.334
Our real sponsor.

14:33.004 --> 14:34.738
Are you outta your mind?

14:34.739 --> 14:37.374
You can't plug
harry's hardware
on <i>tool time.</i>

14:37.375 --> 14:39.810
This isn't your own
personal forum, al.

14:39.811 --> 14:42.813
What? You use this show
as your own personal forum
all the time.

14:42.814 --> 14:45.816
Are you telling me
when I have something important
going on in my life,

14:45.817 --> 14:47.317
I can't use this show?

14:47.318 --> 14:49.386
Bingo.

14:52.156 --> 14:55.158
You know what you are?
You're a mean, selfish
son of a gun.

14:55.159 --> 14:58.095
You're jealous because
I have something you don't.

14:58.096 --> 15:00.698
What, a beard
and 50 extra pounds?

15:03.467 --> 15:06.637
You look just like your father
when I first told him
I was pregnant.

15:08.507 --> 15:11.876
Now, now,
this is really scary now.
I like the big hair.

15:11.877 --> 15:13.811
Quit picking at my face.

15:13.812 --> 15:18.516
No member of my family's
going out of this house
with a loose scab.

15:18.517 --> 15:20.951
It's the way all the kids
are wearing 'em these days.

15:20.952 --> 15:22.686
Oh, well!

15:22.687 --> 15:25.689
So, mom,
how do my brains look?

15:25.690 --> 15:28.792
Eww. Very cerebral.

15:28.793 --> 15:32.329
Mom, dad,
look what al gave me
to add to my costume.

15:36.401 --> 15:40.871
Oh, great. Now he's got my kid
advertising for harry's.
<i>(horn honks)</i>

15:40.872 --> 15:43.674
That's our ride.
Gotta go.
Have a good time, guys.

15:43.675 --> 15:45.643
And be careful out there.

15:45.644 --> 15:49.079
Well, tim, for the first time
in 13 years,

15:49.080 --> 15:52.215
You and I are alone together
on Halloween.

15:52.216 --> 15:55.052
All we gotta do
is turn the lights down low,

15:55.053 --> 15:59.322
Get naked
and scare each other to death.

15:59.323 --> 16:03.027
Just tell me you don't have
"harry's hardware" printed
on your bra.

16:03.028 --> 16:05.429
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

16:05.430 --> 16:08.732
After I get rid of these
trick-or-treaters,
you can find out.

16:08.733 --> 16:11.769
<i>(grunts)</i>

16:11.770 --> 16:14.171
Ilene.
I'm sorry to barge in
like this,

16:14.172 --> 16:17.240
But I am really upset
with al.

16:17.241 --> 16:20.878
So you wore that outfit
to get back at him?

16:20.879 --> 16:24.114
This is my costume
for the Halloween party

16:24.115 --> 16:26.116
At the putt-putt panorama.

16:26.117 --> 16:28.351
Do you think it's too loud?

16:28.352 --> 16:30.420
Oh, no, no, no.

16:30.421 --> 16:33.557
What was the question?
I couldn't hear it
over your outfit.

16:33.558 --> 16:36.060
Al and I were supposed
to go miniature golfing,

16:36.061 --> 16:38.261
But at the last minute
he canceled.

16:38.262 --> 16:40.631
He's still at that
stupid hardware store.

16:40.632 --> 16:42.800
Don't worry.
This is all new to al now,

16:42.801 --> 16:44.969
But he'll calm down
in a couple of days.

16:44.970 --> 16:46.369
I don't think so.

16:46.370 --> 16:49.039
He's canceled our date
for tomorrow so he can work

16:49.040 --> 16:51.675
And the night after that
and the night after that.

16:51.676 --> 16:53.644
Tim, you should talk
to him.

16:53.645 --> 16:57.481
He won't listen to me, either.
He called me a selfish sog.

16:57.482 --> 16:59.483
What's an sog?
"son of a gun."

16:59.484 --> 17:01.986
When al gets mad,
he's a real potty mouth.

17:05.589 --> 17:07.925
Please, tim. Al's looking
at the hardware store

17:07.925 --> 17:09.960
The way he used to
look at me.

17:09.961 --> 17:12.561
Been there.

17:14.031 --> 17:16.900
Still there.

17:18.703 --> 17:21.972
Going there.

17:21.973 --> 17:24.974
I think you'll be very happy
with the long-light halogen.

17:24.976 --> 17:28.377
What are you gonna be
using it for, wilson?

17:28.378 --> 17:30.547
Well, al,
a few of my friends

17:30.548 --> 17:32.582
Are celebrating
the mexican Halloween,

17:32.583 --> 17:35.485
Día de los muertos.

17:35.486 --> 17:39.356
"day of the dead"?
Very good, al.

17:39.357 --> 17:42.660
At harry's hardware,
<i>se habla español.</i>

17:42.661 --> 17:44.662
Well, in that case,

17:44.663 --> 17:48.398
<i>¿cómo van las cosas</i>
<i>con su nuevo negocio?</i>

17:49.901 --> 17:54.171
<i>Se habla español</i>
not so good-o.

17:54.172 --> 17:57.274
I was just asking
how you were enjoying
being a new businessman.

17:57.275 --> 17:59.977
Oh, <i>muy bien.</i> And this is
just the beginning.

17:59.978 --> 18:03.047
Once I learn the ropes,
I'm gonna break free
from harry's

18:03.048 --> 18:05.348
And open my own chain
of hardware stores.

18:05.349 --> 18:08.351
In fact, I stayed up all night
thinking up a name for it.

18:08.352 --> 18:12.255
What do you think of this?
Al's hardware.

18:12.256 --> 18:14.424
That's very evocative.

18:14.425 --> 18:17.828
If all goes according to plan,
I'll double my money
in five years.

18:17.829 --> 18:19.830
That's an admirable goal, al,

18:19.831 --> 18:22.499
But I might remind you
that the american humorist
kin hubbard said,

18:22.500 --> 18:24.501
"to safely double your money,

18:24.502 --> 18:28.471
Fold it over once
and put it in your pocket."

18:28.472 --> 18:30.307
Well, speaking of double,
wilson,

18:30.308 --> 18:32.375
It's double value days
here at harry's.

18:32.376 --> 18:35.746
You buy another flashlight,
I'll throw in the batteries
for free.

18:35.747 --> 18:37.948
I don't think so, al.

18:37.949 --> 18:42.119
All right. Well, then,
that's $39.95 with tax.

18:42.120 --> 18:45.355
There you go.

18:45.356 --> 18:47.691
Thank you.
And there you go.

18:47.692 --> 18:49.727
All right.
And good luck, al.

18:49.728 --> 18:51.228
Speaking of luck,

18:51.229 --> 18:53.964
Next week is lucky dollar day
right here at harry's.

18:53.965 --> 18:55.032
Mm-hmm.

18:55.033 --> 18:57.567
Nice bag o' bones,
buddy.

18:57.568 --> 18:59.937
Why, thank you,
neighbor tim.

18:59.938 --> 19:01.538
Wilson?

19:03.141 --> 19:04.808
What are you doing here, tim?

19:04.809 --> 19:08.212
Well, al, I'm trying
to save a relationship.

19:08.213 --> 19:10.647
I'm moved
that you want to apologize,

19:10.648 --> 19:13.050
But I'm not gonna
give you a discount.

19:13.051 --> 19:15.318
I'm talking
about you and ilene.

19:15.319 --> 19:17.320
Well, I can't give her
a discount, either.

19:17.321 --> 19:20.390
Al... She's sitting
in our house right now.

19:20.391 --> 19:23.393
She's really upset
that you canceled this date.

19:23.394 --> 19:28.398
Well, she's... She's just
gonna have to understand
that I own a business now.

19:28.399 --> 19:30.868
I have a whole new set
of responsibilities.

19:30.869 --> 19:33.637
Al, harry owns 80%
of "your" business.

19:33.638 --> 19:35.639
He never stays here
this late.

19:35.640 --> 19:37.975
Ah, but harry doesn't
see the big picture.

19:37.976 --> 19:40.110
I'm breaking in
a whole new market -

19:40.111 --> 19:42.512
The after-hours
hardware crowd.

19:42.513 --> 19:46.349
Al, I am the after-hours
hardware crowd.

19:46.350 --> 19:48.418
And that's why
I'm working so hard.

19:48.419 --> 19:51.588
This is the first time
I've taken a chance,
and I wanna succeed.

19:51.589 --> 19:54.658
You break it, you bought it.

19:54.659 --> 19:56.994
Up until now it's just been
one big routine.

19:56.995 --> 19:59.329
I get up in the morning
at the same time.

19:59.330 --> 20:01.331
I have the same thing
for breakfast.

20:01.332 --> 20:03.600
I go to the bathroom
at the same time.

20:03.601 --> 20:05.435
Don't knock that.

20:05.436 --> 20:08.405
My father never took a risk
in his life.

20:08.406 --> 20:13.043
He worked at the same factory,
the same job, for 40 years.

20:13.044 --> 20:16.346
Now, I know they offered him
better jobs, but he was afraid
to take them

20:16.347 --> 20:19.582
Because he didn't want
to take the chance
of losing what he had.

20:19.583 --> 20:22.886
Come on, al.
You're not like your dad.
You take risks every day.

20:22.887 --> 20:24.587
Oh, yeah? Like what?

20:24.588 --> 20:26.890
You work with me.

20:26.891 --> 20:29.193
Well, that's true.

20:29.194 --> 20:31.995
What I'm saying, al,
is that risk worked,

20:31.996 --> 20:34.331
And this one can, too.

20:34.332 --> 20:36.867
You're gonna make harry
a great partner.

20:36.868 --> 20:38.802
You think so?

20:38.803 --> 20:42.005
I just wish you wouldn't
drive everybody crazy,
including harry and ilene.

20:42.006 --> 20:45.008
I know my behavior's been
a bit overzealous.

20:45.009 --> 20:48.545
Hey, why don't I
close up early tonight?

20:48.546 --> 20:50.714
That's a good idea.
You can meet ilene.

20:50.715 --> 20:54.084
She looks pretty terrific
in those little knickers
she's wearing.

20:54.085 --> 20:55.819
In a couple of hours,

20:55.820 --> 20:57.855
The putt-putt
will be shut-shut.

20:57.856 --> 21:00.257
You're such a nut-nut.

21:00.258 --> 21:02.492
Why don't I get my coat
and we'll lock up?

21:02.493 --> 21:05.095
Hey, wait a minute. Go on.
You go on. I'll lock up for you.

21:05.096 --> 21:08.565
You want me to leave you alone
in my hardware store?

21:08.566 --> 21:11.902
Yes, I do.

21:11.903 --> 21:14.238
I don't think so, tim.

21:14.239 --> 21:15.272
All right.

21:16.741 --> 21:18.909
Come on,
let me stay here, please.

21:18.910 --> 21:21.078
You gotta start
taking risks.
No. No, come on.

21:21.079 --> 21:23.080
Let me just do it,
just this -

21:23.081 --> 21:26.884
Whoa, what's this?
<i>(metal crashes)</i>

21:26.885 --> 21:29.887
I don't know,
but you just bought it.

21:33.491 --> 21:35.592
Hi, guys.

21:35.593 --> 21:37.761
I can't believe
mark won the contest,

21:37.762 --> 21:39.763
And we didn't
even get anything.

21:39.764 --> 21:41.999
I knew you'd win.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.369
If you ask me,
the whole thing was fixed.

21:45.370 --> 21:47.371
Yeah, you should've seen
the judges.

21:47.372 --> 21:49.472
It was an all-flannel panel.

21:49.473 --> 21:53.176
Guys,
I won fair and square.

21:53.177 --> 21:56.746
I can't help it if al's mom
was the head judge.

21:58.182 --> 22:00.550
<i>(sighs)</i>

22:00.551 --> 22:03.353
Well, kids home?

22:03.354 --> 22:06.189
You'll be happy to know
that al left the hardware store,

22:06.190 --> 22:08.691
He met ilene,
and they are now
miniature golfing.

22:08.692 --> 22:10.360
You're a good friend.

22:10.361 --> 22:13.363
Yep. She's got the red ball,
he's got the green ball,

22:13.364 --> 22:15.966
And after nine holes
they switch.

22:17.902 --> 22:19.903
How about you?
Are you and al ok?

22:19.904 --> 22:23.673
Yep. We're all right.
He gave me the key
to the hardware store.

22:23.674 --> 22:26.076
He gave you the key
to the hardware store?

22:26.077 --> 22:28.211
He just doesn't know it yet.

22:30.548 --> 22:32.816
He gave me the key
to the hardware store.

22:32.817 --> 22:35.518
He gave you the key
