00:03.036 --> 00:06.563
There's nothing quite like
putting up Christmas decorations.

00:06.740 --> 00:09.504
Yeah. Hey, what you want for Christmas,
Granny?

00:09.676 --> 00:12.042
Oh, at my age, you don't need much.

00:12.212 --> 00:13.873
Just the love of your family.

00:14.047 --> 00:17.778
Oh. Cool. Hey, but at my age,
you need a little more.

00:17.951 --> 00:21.682
Listen,
you mind taking a look at this here?

00:21.855 --> 00:24.517
I know you got a little pull
with the big guy, you know...

00:24.691 --> 00:26.784
...so I was hoping
you'd put in a word for me.

00:26.960 --> 00:30.657
Hey, just let him know that the few times
that I have been naughty, it was real nice.

00:30.830 --> 00:32.821
You know what I mean? Heh, heh.

00:33.166 --> 00:35.464
Carlton, what are you doing?

00:35.635 --> 00:38.331
Mom said while she was gone,
I could decorate the tree.

00:38.505 --> 00:40.803
No, Mom said while she was gone,
I could decorate.

00:40.974 --> 00:43.374
All right.
Carlton, you take one half of the tree.

00:43.543 --> 00:45.477
Ashley, you take the other.

00:46.179 --> 00:48.306
Fine. Carlton, you can have the top half.

00:50.717 --> 00:52.685
There's my Christmas cookies.

00:52.852 --> 00:54.444
Oh, great, Geoffrey you're here.

00:54.621 --> 00:57.784
And if I said I weren't,
would you leave me alone?

00:57.957 --> 00:59.925
You can't get me down, Geoffrey.
Not today.

01:00.093 --> 01:04.029
Today is the happiest day of my life. Until
tomorrow, when my show goes national...

01:04.197 --> 01:07.758
...which will make that the new
happiest day of my life. That'll make today...

01:07.934 --> 01:10.061
I get the pattern, Miss Hilary.

01:10.537 --> 01:13.062
Then you'll hem these? Great.

01:13.440 --> 01:15.704
Geoffrey's on board.

01:17.444 --> 01:19.674
Oh, Daddy, you're here. Heh, heh.

01:20.113 --> 01:21.637
Congratulations on your big day.

01:21.815 --> 01:25.182
Oh, thank you. Have you decided
which TV you're gonna watch it on?

01:25.351 --> 01:27.251
- Yeah. This one right here.
- Great, great.

01:27.420 --> 01:30.082
- Come on, sit down. Sit down.
- Okay. Okay.

01:31.558 --> 01:34.857
Click. Heh, heh. Look, I'm on.

01:35.028 --> 01:38.054
Let's practice.
How are you gonna watch me?

01:41.234 --> 01:44.726
Oh, good, good. Oh, this is so exciting.

01:44.904 --> 01:48.465
Look, there I am interviewing
some very important guests. Heh, heh.

01:48.641 --> 01:51.508
- Will, who's on the show tomorrow?
- A bunch of pregnant women.

01:51.878 --> 01:55.507
Great, I'll look thin.
Not that I don't, anyway.

01:55.682 --> 01:58.446
- Oh, I have a real knack for this.
- Yeah.

01:58.618 --> 02:01.553

Whoo-hoo!

03:59.639 --> 04:04.372
Oh, man. Oh, Hil, you were slamming.
The show was kicking.

04:04.544 --> 04:08.947
Werner, if you don't stop dancing,
I'm about to get seasick.

04:10.650 --> 04:13.517
I'm here with
national talk-show hostess, Hilary Banks.

04:13.686 --> 04:15.085
Hilary, how do you feel?

04:15.255 --> 04:18.156
They like me. They really like me.

04:18.791 --> 04:21.281
Now, Hilary,
now that you've reached this pinnacle...

04:21.461 --> 04:24.658
...this high-point in your career,
what's left for you to accomplish?

04:24.831 --> 04:26.822
How will you possibly top this?

04:27.000 --> 04:29.230
Oh, that's easy. I was thinking...

04:29.402 --> 04:31.063
Well, um...

04:32.038 --> 04:34.302
Well, I think that I'm goi... Ugh.

04:34.474 --> 04:36.339
No.

04:37.377 --> 04:39.038
Well, maybe I can't top this.

04:39.212 --> 04:40.201
Right. Right.

04:41.547 --> 04:43.447
My water broke.

04:45.451 --> 04:47.817
Oh, okay.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.758
Excuse me, I'm a doctor.

04:52.925 --> 04:55.120
- Okay, have a seat.
All right. All right. Cool.

04:55.695 --> 04:59.756
<i>Now, this is just like on ER, y'all.
All right, so just chill. Everybody, just relax.</i>

04:59.932 --> 05:02.560
Hey, hey, how do you feel right now?

05:02.735 --> 05:05.568
- Can somebody get this clown out of here?
- Allow me.

05:16.683 --> 05:20.016
This is the happiest day of my life.

05:20.186 --> 05:23.644
Whoa. What a coincidence,
Hil, this is the happiest day of your life too.

05:23.823 --> 05:26.257
Your show just went national.

05:26.426 --> 05:29.156
I know. Don't I look happy?

05:29.329 --> 05:32.730
Hey, Spike Lee. We gotta clear a path,
let this woman out of here.

05:32.899 --> 05:37.302
Whoo! It's the good doctor.
Congratulations, doc.

05:37.470 --> 05:38.528
Hey, put it there.

05:38.705 --> 05:41.037
Hey, you know what?
Right after you wash that.

05:52.852 --> 05:55.013
Hey. Uncle Phil, what you think?

05:55.188 --> 05:58.123
Oh, it's, uh, big.

05:58.291 --> 06:01.351
Hey, you know, it's the perfect size
for, like, I don't know...

06:01.527 --> 06:06.294
...a THX, Dolby Pro Logic,
surround-sound subwoofer.

06:06.466 --> 06:07.899
Uh, what's my odds?

06:11.537 --> 06:13.334
- Laughing, that's a good sign.
- Ha, ha, ha.

06:19.979 --> 06:23.471
<i>Jingle bell, jingle bell

06:23.649 --> 06:27.016

06:27.186 --> 06:29.154
Merry Christmas, everybody.

06:29.322 --> 06:31.847
- Wait, wait, wait. What is that?
- It's called flocking.

06:32.024 --> 06:34.720
- It makes the tree look pretty.
- It makes it look cheesy...

06:34.894 --> 06:36.486
...and I won't have it on my tree.

06:36.662 --> 06:38.892
Oh, your tree?
Let me tell you something, missy.

06:39.065 --> 06:40.692
Get that flocking can away from me.

06:40.867 --> 06:43.392
- How dare you speak to me like that?
- There's no way...

06:43.569 --> 06:46.629
That's your side of the tree.
I can do whatever I want to my side.

06:46.806 --> 06:47.795
Ah.

06:47.974 --> 06:49.942
- Granny, let a brother get a finger full.
- Get.

06:50.109 --> 06:52.839
- Let a brother get a finger full.
- Get, get, get.

07:05.224 --> 07:06.953
You know, l...

07:07.126 --> 07:12.120
I just can't seem to get this bowl
to stand still.

07:13.166 --> 07:16.727
It might help if you put down the eggnog.

07:17.069 --> 07:19.060
Worth a try.

07:28.347 --> 07:30.474
You know, you're right.

07:36.722 --> 07:38.553
- Hi, Grandma.
- Hi, honey.

07:38.724 --> 07:40.954
I'm so glad you're here.

07:41.127 --> 07:44.893
I need someone to talk to.
See, I just don't know what to do.

07:45.064 --> 07:47.624
I was all set for today to be
the best day of my life...

07:47.800 --> 07:50.360
...but it feels just like any other day.

07:50.536 --> 07:55.906
And I have this empty feeling,
you know, like something's missing?

07:56.075 --> 07:59.010
Sure, I have an effervescent personality...

07:59.178 --> 08:03.205
...and a smile that could blind you
from across the room...

08:04.283 --> 08:07.616
...but I just feel so blah.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.688
Oh, I'm sorry,
were you saying something, honey?

08:11.858 --> 08:13.723
You've gotta talk into my good ear.

08:18.464 --> 08:21.831
I'm just happy
that you're here for the holidays.

08:33.279 --> 08:37.648
Okay, Hil, this is it. Now, these promos are
important so say it like you mean it, okay?

08:38.818 --> 08:40.649
And action.

08:40.820 --> 08:43.812
<i>Good morning, KFNS in Phoenix,
this is Hilary of the Hilary Show.</i>

08:43.990 --> 08:46.618
Be sure to watch us weekdays at 4.

08:47.860 --> 08:51.227
Hilary, the idea of these promos
is to attract an audience...

08:51.397 --> 08:54.764
...and make the show sound interesting.
Give it a little gusto, you know?

08:54.934 --> 08:56.561
- Give it that Hilary pizzazz.
- Okay.

08:56.736 --> 08:59.034
Hil, you could try
a little something like this.

08:59.405 --> 09:03.034
Good morning, KFNS in...

09:03.209 --> 09:05.734
<i>Phoenix, Phoenix</i>

09:05.912 --> 09:07.277

09:11.183 --> 09:12.707
Yeah.

09:12.885 --> 09:16.218

and whatever it was that he just did.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.653
Okay. Fine.

09:19.759 --> 09:21.192

09:31.003 --> 09:32.027

09:32.538 --> 09:34.199
Just give it another try.

09:34.607 --> 09:37.508
You know,
my head really isn't into this right now.

09:37.677 --> 09:40.373
Will, there's somewhere I'd like to go.
Could you take me?

09:40.546 --> 09:41.604
- Yeah. Sure, Hil.
- Okay.

09:51.557 --> 09:55.653
Hil, couldn't you have said this
with flowers?

09:56.596 --> 09:58.154
<i>Dr. King, dial 9.</i>

09:58.331 --> 10:00.526

Is it okay?

10:00.700 --> 10:02.065
Come on in. Come on in.

10:02.234 --> 10:04.566
I just thought I'd stop by
and see the baby.

10:04.737 --> 10:05.897
Well...

10:06.072 --> 10:09.974
Oh, he's so cute. Isn't he, Will?

10:10.142 --> 10:12.303
Oh, yeah.
Well, you know, bald head, pudgy.

10:12.478 --> 10:15.879
If he had a beard,
he'd look just like my Uncle Phil. Ha, ha, ha.

10:16.182 --> 10:17.444
Would you like to hold him?

10:17.617 --> 10:20.882
Oh, yeah. I do. Let me hold him.
I wanna hold the baby.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.250
- Careful.
Please, Hil.

10:25.424 --> 10:28.291
Like I never held a baby before.
I know what I'm doing.

10:28.461 --> 10:32.363
Whoa. Hey, dude. Hold up.
He tripping. He tripping.

10:36.335 --> 10:38.394
Oh, he's so cute.

10:40.239 --> 10:43.538
Oh, look at his little nose. Heh, heh.

10:43.709 --> 10:45.574
And his little hands.

10:47.146 --> 10:49.080
Hil, check it out.

10:50.082 --> 10:52.710
Uncle Phil's hand. Ha, ha, ha.

10:54.220 --> 10:57.348
- How's the new mommy? Feeling okay?
- Great.

10:57.523 --> 11:00.617
Look at you. You look so comfortable
holding that baby.

11:00.793 --> 11:01.885
Oh, really?

11:02.061 --> 11:04.461
A baby will always tell you
when he's in good hands.

11:06.065 --> 11:07.965
And when he's hungry.

11:13.005 --> 11:16.270
Ay! Hey, hey, hey.

11:16.442 --> 11:19.502
Okay. You know, I just remembered...

11:19.679 --> 11:23.240
...I gotta go someplace, uh,
where that's not happening.

11:23.416 --> 11:26.146
- Hey, come on, Hil.
- Can't we just stay a little longer?

11:26.519 --> 11:29.420
Well, I'm off my shift in 15 minutes.
I can give you a ride.

11:29.588 --> 11:31.715
Okay. Great.

11:31.891 --> 11:36.385
Oh. Remember, doc, no mouth-to-mouth
on the first date, huh? Ha, ha, ha.

11:39.832 --> 11:41.493
Will.

11:42.001 --> 11:45.164
Oh, it's like a hotel.
They expect you to take this stuff.

11:51.243 --> 11:53.905
Have you taken the roast
out of the oven yet, Geoffrey?

11:54.080 --> 11:57.811
Show me again how it's done,
Nana Hattie.

11:57.983 --> 12:00.008
Oh, all right.

12:00.619 --> 12:03.850
I love my job.

12:04.924 --> 12:07.154
Mm-mm-mm. Grandma Hattie's roast.

12:07.326 --> 12:10.193
You know, a cow would be happy
to be in your kitchen.

12:10.362 --> 12:13.058
Boy, am I happy to be here.

12:15.334 --> 12:17.529
Oh, great. You're all here.

12:17.703 --> 12:19.568
I have some really big news.

12:19.739 --> 12:22.139
No news is bigger
than my mother's roast.

12:22.641 --> 12:24.472
I'm gonna have a baby.

12:26.178 --> 12:28.738
Now, that would be bigger than the roast.

12:34.086 --> 12:36.816
Daddy, you're gonna be a grandpa.

12:36.989 --> 12:39.423
Daddy, say something.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.890
Geoffrey, get the Scotch.

12:42.061 --> 12:44.291
- It's gone, sir.
- What?

12:44.463 --> 12:47.432
You've said
my attitude has improved lately.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.033
How could this happen?

12:49.201 --> 12:51.795
It's the pressure, sir.

12:51.971 --> 12:56.499
Phil, calm down. Hilary, darling,
this doesn't have to be bad news.

12:56.909 --> 12:58.706
Having a child is a gift.

12:58.878 --> 13:02.041
Now, come on, tell Grandma,
who's the father?

13:02.214 --> 13:03.511
I don't know.

13:03.682 --> 13:04.842
Oh, dear God.

13:06.485 --> 13:08.510
Ashley, take your grandmother upstairs.

13:08.687 --> 13:10.086
Will, takes notes.

13:10.256 --> 13:12.156
Come on, grandma.

13:13.592 --> 13:16.390
Just how pregnant are you?

13:16.929 --> 13:20.558
Who said I was pregnant?
I said I was gonna have a baby.

13:21.634 --> 13:25.900
I think Aunt Viv must've dropped the ball
on that little girl-girl talk.

13:26.205 --> 13:28.503
Hilary, you're not making any sense.

13:28.874 --> 13:30.671
I'm not pregnant yet.

13:30.843 --> 13:34.108
I'm gonna go down to one of those
fertility clinics and find a donor.

13:34.680 --> 13:39.583
After Will and I went to the hospital,
I realized what was missing in my life.

13:39.752 --> 13:42.846
- I need a baby.
- Oh. Heh, heh.

13:43.022 --> 13:45.115
Are you insane?

13:45.291 --> 13:48.852
Do you have any idea
what having a baby entails, huh?

13:49.028 --> 13:52.191
This is madness.
A baby is a lifetime commitment.

13:52.364 --> 13:55.595
A commitment that a couple makes.
A baby is not a pick-me-up.

13:55.768 --> 13:59.670
Scotch is a pick-me-up.
Damn that, Geoffrey.

14:01.440 --> 14:04.409
Daddy, I didn't come here
for your permission...

14:04.577 --> 14:06.909
...I came here for your blessing.

14:09.381 --> 14:12.043
- This is your fault.
- Hey, man. How you gonna blame me?

14:12.218 --> 14:15.915
You're the one who took her to the hospital.
Therefore, it's your fault. There.

14:16.088 --> 14:20.024
Oh, forget it. I don't know what I'm saying.
What am I gonna say to Vivian?

14:20.192 --> 14:21.659
Uh...

14:21.827 --> 14:24.523
"Hi, Grandma"? Heh, heh.

14:24.697 --> 14:25.925
Hoo.

14:31.403 --> 14:34.600
Thanks for coming, Will.
It's really great to have your support.

14:34.773 --> 14:36.365
No problem. When you leave here...

14:36.542 --> 14:39.340
...there'll be no doubt in your mind
what you wanna do.

14:41.247 --> 14:47.447
Excuse me. I'd like some information
about your, um, inventory.

14:47.620 --> 14:52.023
Are you looking for something specific?

14:53.225 --> 14:55.523
What have you got in a hunk?

14:56.495 --> 15:00.488
You'll be happy to know that
our donors are screened very thoroughly.

15:00.666 --> 15:05.330
We have everything from doctors
to rocket scientists.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.601
You wouldn't happen to have this month's,
would you?

15:09.008 --> 15:11.977
Sure. Here you are, doctor.

15:12.311 --> 15:14.108
Thank you.

15:14.747 --> 15:17.580
We get lots of doctors.

15:18.617 --> 15:21.552
Ugh! I don't think so.

15:27.693 --> 15:29.183
Hey, yo. Thanks a lot, man.

15:29.361 --> 15:32.421
- Glad I could be of service.
- Hey, come on, let's get out of here.

15:32.598 --> 15:34.088
Uh...

15:34.566 --> 15:35.965
I'll catch up to you later.

15:40.039 --> 15:45.204
Thank you all for joining me on another
journey of love, happiness and good cheer.

15:45.377 --> 15:48.972
So until tomorrow, goodbye.
And remember...

15:49.148 --> 15:51.116
Okay?

15:52.851 --> 15:56.378
Whoo! Hey, good show, Hil.
I'm glad to see you're feeling better.

15:56.555 --> 15:57.988
Oh, what'd you expect?

15:58.157 --> 16:00.853
Well, you know, after today,
I kind of thought you...

16:01.026 --> 16:03.221
Oh. That was just a little setback.
I'm a trouper.

16:03.395 --> 16:05.420
Girl, you are a super-duper trouper.

16:05.597 --> 16:08.691
Well, I just hope my baby's
a super-duper trouper too. Heh, heh.

16:09.335 --> 16:10.768
Huh?

16:10.936 --> 16:12.301
- Baby?
Hey.

16:13.138 --> 16:15.606
- You ready?
- Hey, what's up, doc. What you doing?

16:15.774 --> 16:19.369
Come back to deliver another baby, huh?
What, you get a commission on them?

16:19.545 --> 16:22.036
No, I came to pick up Hilary.

16:22.715 --> 16:25.240
Bye, Will. On to plan B.

16:32.725 --> 16:34.352
So how do you like the food?

16:34.526 --> 16:36.153
- It's delicious.
- Good.

16:36.328 --> 16:38.728
I found this place
the first year of my internship.

16:38.897 --> 16:41.866
I was dying for food
that didn't come out of a machine.

16:42.034 --> 16:44.229
Heh, heh. I spent some time in Milan...

16:44.403 --> 16:48.032
...and this place reminds me of a little
restaurant near the Piazza Di Vani.

16:48.207 --> 16:51.176
So any mental illness in your family?

16:51.543 --> 16:53.238
Heh. Excuse me?

16:53.412 --> 16:57.872
Schizophrenia? Anorexia?
You know, general weirdness?

16:58.384 --> 17:02.252
Uh, not that I know of.
So tell me, what were you doing in Italy?

17:02.421 --> 17:05.185
Shopping and studying Italian.

17:05.357 --> 17:07.257
- So you speak Italian?
- Well, not exactly.

17:07.425 --> 17:10.088
I did more shopping than studying,
but it didn't matter...

17:10.262 --> 17:13.698
...I mean, they have translators
in all those little shops.

17:13.965 --> 17:19.336
So back to you. Any heart disease?
Gingivitis? Midgets?

17:20.439 --> 17:21.633
No.

17:21.807 --> 17:23.707
Any relatives in the circus?

17:24.242 --> 17:28.406
Uh, not that I know of. I mean...
I did have an uncle who was a clown.

17:29.148 --> 17:31.673
Ew. Duly noted.

17:32.785 --> 17:36.186
Oh. Aren't they so cute?

17:37.322 --> 17:40.189
You're so lucky,
you get to be around babies all the time.

17:40.359 --> 17:44.295
Yeah, babies are great.
I can't wait to have a family someday.

17:44.463 --> 17:46.158
How about you?

17:47.699 --> 17:49.394
I suppose.

17:49.568 --> 17:51.593
Oh, so you're not ready for babies, huh?

17:51.770 --> 17:55.536
No, I'm definitely ready for a baby,
it's just the family.

17:55.707 --> 17:57.402
I mean...

17:57.576 --> 17:59.544
I hadn't thought about it, I guess.

17:59.711 --> 18:03.203
I don't understand. I mean,
how can you have one without the other?

18:06.685 --> 18:09.848
Wait, wasn't I the one
asking all the questions?

18:13.292 --> 18:15.157
Want another hit?

18:15.794 --> 18:17.455
Hit me.

18:26.738 --> 18:28.035
Ah...

18:30.409 --> 18:32.570
What were we thinking about
having kids?

18:35.848 --> 18:38.476
What? What?

18:38.717 --> 18:42.380
I was wondering what life would've been
like without the headaches of parenting.

18:44.156 --> 18:45.987
Imagine that, if you ain't had no kids.

18:46.158 --> 18:50.595
It'd just be you, Aunt Viv and me
all by ourselves in this big house. Ha, ha, ha.

18:50.762 --> 18:53.322
Party, you know.

18:57.202 --> 18:58.464
I saw the light on.

18:59.838 --> 19:01.635
Can I talk to you, Daddy?

19:01.807 --> 19:03.832
Oh, God, I don't wanna do this.
I wish I'd...

19:04.843 --> 19:06.333
Daddy, please?

19:06.812 --> 19:10.475
- Fine. Will, will you excuse us, please?
- Oh, yeah. Sure thing.

19:10.649 --> 19:13.880
Hey, look, Uncle Phil,
I just want you to know I got your back.

19:14.052 --> 19:16.748
All right? Anything jump off,
all you got to do is holler...

19:16.922 --> 19:18.890
- Goodbye, Will.
- All right.

19:23.662 --> 19:26.222
Where did we go wrong?

19:34.306 --> 19:36.934
Well? You said you wanted to talk.

19:40.445 --> 19:42.675
Daddy, I'm not gonna have a baby.

19:42.848 --> 19:45.373
Oh, that's a relief.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.881
I must tell you,
this whole thing has been very upsetting.

19:49.488 --> 19:52.116
It's been upsetting for me too.

19:54.126 --> 19:58.256
I thought that the show going national
was gonna change my life.

19:58.497 --> 20:01.728
I mean,
I had set certain career goals for myself...

20:01.900 --> 20:06.428
...and then when I reached them,
I still felt empty.

20:06.939 --> 20:11.569
Sweetheart,
it's fine to have career goals...

20:11.743 --> 20:14.678
...it's wrong to assume
that's all you need to make you happy.

20:14.846 --> 20:19.146
I know.
That's why I thought I needed a baby.

20:19.318 --> 20:20.910
Maybe I need a new car.

20:21.086 --> 20:22.576
Oh, God, Hilary.

20:22.754 --> 20:24.654
I'm kidding, Daddy.

20:24.823 --> 20:28.919
Oh, God. I don't have all the answers.
I wish I did, but I don't.

20:29.094 --> 20:30.994
You know, it used to be so easy.

20:31.163 --> 20:33.825
You'd cry, I'd buy you a bracelet.

20:33.999 --> 20:36.627
You cried louder, maybe some earrings.

20:36.802 --> 20:39.236
I miss those days.

20:40.572 --> 20:42.540
Just remember...

20:42.708 --> 20:46.269
...happiness comes from inside. Hm?

20:49.114 --> 20:52.709
- I love you, Daddy.
- I love you too, sweetheart.

20:55.587 --> 20:57.919
- It's perfect.
- It's perfect.

20:58.090 --> 21:00.456
- I was talking about my side.
- Your side?

21:00.626 --> 21:05.359
Please. I've seen better looking trees
hanging from rearview mirrors.

21:05.530 --> 21:09.022
Oh, please. Your side looks like
someone threw up on a snowman.

21:09.201 --> 21:11.863
- Threw up on a snowman?
- Hey, hey, that's enough, you two.

21:12.037 --> 21:17.339
All right, now,
each side is very nice in its own way.

21:19.778 --> 21:21.609
You really think so, Will?

21:21.780 --> 21:24.715
Yeah. I mean, you might've
laid the flock on a little thick...

21:24.883 --> 21:28.649
...but other than that, it's very busy.

21:31.423 --> 21:33.288
Not bad, Will. Not bad.

21:33.458 --> 21:37.224
I'm just kind of getting the hang of this
parenting thing here, know what I mean?

21:37.396 --> 21:40.661
Hey, Dad, I'm heading down to the mall.
Mind if I borrow a few bucks?

21:40.832 --> 21:44.962
I'm sorry, I'm busted. You're gonna have
to get back with me later on that one.

21:45.337 --> 21:50.070
You call that dusting, Geoffrey?
Give me that. I'll do it myself.

21:51.677 --> 21:56.376
God bless us, everyone.
