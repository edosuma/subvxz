00:11.386 --> 00:13.548
"Chief of Security
of the World Trade Center."

00:13.639 --> 00:15.972
It's got a pretty nice ring to it.

00:16.140 --> 00:18.178
John O'Neill. You will be missed.

00:18.352 --> 00:21.015
The Bureau didn't deserve you.
We were the lucky ones.

00:21.313 --> 00:22.474
Cheers.

00:22.773 --> 00:24.059
- Cheers.
- My man!

00:24.274 --> 00:27.858
<i>It appears we've lost our two
Saudis, al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi.</i>

00:28.111 --> 00:29.397
I thought responsible eyes were on them.

00:29.488 --> 00:30.854
I thought so, too.

00:30.948 --> 00:33.816
<i>These guys are obviously
craftier than we thought.</i>

00:33.951 --> 00:37.069
<i>I-49 just sent over a list of Arabs</i>

00:37.162 --> 00:40.075
<i>who attended or are enrolled
in US flight schools.</i>

00:40.165 --> 00:42.873
And what does I-49 want us
to do with this list?

00:42.960 --> 00:44.826
People inside Langley
know about Mihdhar.

00:44.920 --> 00:46.411
You need to understand something.

00:46.505 --> 00:49.964
<i>If you reveal that intelligence
to anyone outside this Station,</i>

00:50.175 --> 00:52.417
<i>I will see to it
that you are handcuffed,</i>

00:52.511 --> 00:54.628
<i>that you are escorted
from this building,</i>

00:54.721 --> 00:56.178
<i>that you are imprisoned,</i>

00:56.265 --> 00:58.131
and tried for theft and treason.

01:03.272 --> 01:04.854
<i>Is there something you need from me?</i>

01:04.940 --> 01:06.977
<i>I need to speak with Abu Jandal.</i>

01:07.067 --> 01:09.935
<i>I know Jandal knows something
about the</i> Cole <i>attack.</i>

01:17.452 --> 01:19.239
George Tenet, please.

01:21.915 --> 01:22.905
Yes?

01:23.166 --> 01:24.202
George.

01:24.543 --> 01:26.125
<i>We must speak.</i>

01:28.000 --> 01:34.074

01:57.075 --> 01:59.988
I have only
a very brief opening statement.

02:01.038 --> 02:05.248
I welcome these hearings
because of the opportunity

02:05.334 --> 02:07.291
that they provide to the American people

02:08.252 --> 02:12.964
to better understand why
the tragedy of 9/11 happened,

02:13.050 --> 02:16.214
and what we must do
to prevent a reoccurrence.

02:16.595 --> 02:20.839
I also welcome the hearings because
it is finally a forum where

02:21.183 --> 02:24.142
I can apologize

02:24.227 --> 02:28.813
to the loved ones
of the victims of 9/11.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.770
To them who are here in the room,

02:33.570 --> 02:36.813
to those who are watching on television,

02:38.367 --> 02:41.951
your government failed you.

02:43.163 --> 02:48.625
Those entrusted with protecting you
failed you,

02:48.752 --> 02:52.041
and I failed you.

02:53.465 --> 02:56.924
We tried hard,

02:57.010 --> 03:01.220
but that doesn't matter,
because we failed.

03:01.348 --> 03:04.512
And for that failure,

03:04.601 --> 03:08.686
I would ask, once all the facts are out,

03:10.565 --> 03:13.899
for your understanding,

03:13.985 --> 03:17.069
and for your forgiveness.

03:41.972 --> 03:43.008
Have a good one.

03:43.140 --> 03:44.597
You do the same. Thanks, bro.

03:44.683 --> 03:46.219
- Next?
- Coffee, light.

03:46.309 --> 03:47.516
And, a Danish, please.

04:16.882 --> 04:18.874
- Morning, fellas.
- Hey, morning, John.

04:18.966 --> 04:22.005
- Another day in paradise.
- It's one word for it.

04:45.494 --> 04:47.656
Is that an earthquake?

05:14.648 --> 05:15.638
<i>The blaze,</i>

05:15.732 --> 05:19.476
<i>with thick smoke coming out
of two sides of the building,</i>

05:19.611 --> 05:21.773
<i>the result of a plane crash</i>

05:21.988 --> 05:25.447
<i>by what's thought to be a jet plane,
possibly a 73...</i>

05:32.541 --> 05:35.784
Single file! Follow me! Follow me!

05:36.253 --> 05:37.869
All right.

05:39.798 --> 05:42.415
I want this plane in the air, now!

05:48.598 --> 05:50.339
No one's heard from John O'Neill?

05:50.433 --> 05:53.642
I'm still trying to reach my mom.
New York's cell towers are jammed up.

05:54.104 --> 05:56.312
- He was there, you know?
- I know, I know.

05:56.398 --> 06:00.563
South Tower of the World Trade Center's
just been hit. Another plane.

06:01.444 --> 06:04.027
Let's go, people!
I need everyone on the plane, now!

06:04.114 --> 06:06.527
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!

06:06.658 --> 06:09.901
Go, go, go, go!
Let's go, people! Come on!

06:13.790 --> 06:15.747
Soufan! Agent Soufan!

06:15.876 --> 06:17.333
- Soufan!
- Soufan!

06:17.711 --> 06:19.247
Yeah?

06:19.337 --> 06:21.624
Chihoyne called.
You need to return to the embassy.

06:21.715 --> 06:24.173
- Why?
- He didn't say!

06:42.736 --> 06:45.319
<i>A tremendous
amount of smoke pouring out.</i>

06:45.405 --> 06:49.490
<i>It's the result of what appears to
have been a deliberate terrorist attack.</i>

06:49.701 --> 06:51.317
<i>Around 9:00 this morning,</i>

06:51.411 --> 06:54.199
<i>two large passenger planes
flew into each of the towers,</i>

06:54.289 --> 06:56.451
<i>the North and South Towers
of the World...</i>

07:05.967 --> 07:08.209
- What are they saying out there?
- I don't know.

07:08.303 --> 07:10.010
<i>...confirm these reports,</i>

07:10.096 --> 07:11.303
<i>which have been growing in intensity,</i>

07:11.389 --> 07:13.802
<i>that a section of
the World Trade Center</i>

07:13.892 --> 07:16.384
<i>has collapsed onto the street below.</i>

07:16.478 --> 07:17.844
<i>Do you see any confirmation of that?</i>

07:17.938 --> 07:20.476
<i>It's true, Dan.
That's what we were all running from.</i>

07:20.607 --> 07:23.520
<i>We heard the building coming down,
and that's what we were running from.</i>

07:23.652 --> 07:26.019
<i>Literally, people
ran out of their shoes,</i>

07:26.112 --> 07:27.899
<i>trying to get out of the way
of this thing.</i>

07:28.281 --> 07:29.522
<i>Well, one can certainly understand that.</i>

07:29.616 --> 07:30.823
<i>So, Harold Dow, our man...</i>

07:30.909 --> 07:32.400
Chihoyne... Where is he?

07:32.535 --> 07:34.652
<i>...reports that he can confirm</i>

07:34.746 --> 07:37.659
<i>that a section, we do not know
how large a section,</i>

07:37.791 --> 07:40.078
<i>a section of one of...</i>

07:40.210 --> 07:42.122
- What?
<i>- ...the World Trade Center towers...</i>

07:42.212 --> 07:44.545
- Why am I not on that flight?
<i>- ...has collapsed into the street below.</i>

07:44.631 --> 07:46.873
<i>Now, for those who got to view...</i>

07:48.885 --> 07:50.467
I need to show you something.

07:53.431 --> 07:54.672
What is this?

07:59.854 --> 08:02.221
This is the meeting in Malaysia.

08:05.777 --> 08:07.234
And the pay phone.

08:07.529 --> 08:09.737
The number I've been
asking about for months.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.155
Langley sent it this morning,

08:11.241 --> 08:14.234
and Washington needs to know immediately
if this was an al-Qaeda attack.

08:14.369 --> 08:18.909
They need confirmation,
and you're the best man to get it.

08:19.582 --> 08:23.826
I asked you repeatedly
about the meeting in Malaysia.

08:23.920 --> 08:26.583
Did you company men have any idea

08:26.715 --> 08:29.799
what we could have done
with this if you had shared it?

08:30.927 --> 08:34.294
John O'Neill was there, this morning!

09:09.466 --> 09:11.298
<i>And the most
chilling moment for me, Chris,</i>

09:11.384 --> 09:16.095
<i>as I walked the streets downtown,
was a fighterjet flying overtop,</i>

09:16.181 --> 09:19.970
<i>and literally thousands of people
looking up into the sky, watching...</i>

09:20.060 --> 09:22.427
<i>- The Air...
- ...a fighterjet fly across...</i>

09:22.520 --> 09:23.852
<i>Yeah, that's something
you don't see.</i>

09:23.980 --> 09:25.516
<i>The Air Force, obviously,
has been mobilized,</i>

09:25.607 --> 09:28.020
<i>and is in the air, now,
looking for any other aircraft.</i>

09:28.109 --> 09:29.441
<i>You know, we had reports earlier,</i>

09:29.527 --> 09:30.938
<i>- both from ABC and...
- Chris...</i>

09:31.029 --> 09:32.065
<i>Wait, hold on.
One second, one second.</i>

09:32.155 --> 09:33.145
<i>- Yes, John?
- The other</i>

09:33.239 --> 09:34.650
<i>World Trade Center
building just collapsed.</i>

09:34.741 --> 09:36.448
<i>Oh, my God, it did.</i>

09:36.618 --> 09:38.200
<i>That is the... Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

09:38.286 --> 09:40.243
<i>the World Trade Center
in New York is no more.</i>

09:40.330 --> 09:43.164
<i>Both of the towers
have absolutely collapsed.</i>

09:43.333 --> 09:44.790
<i>Let me go back up to New York.</i>

10:00.183 --> 10:04.427
I want Abu Jandal. Now.

10:04.521 --> 10:06.262
No, no reason for talk.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.064
You must leave here.

10:09.234 --> 10:11.521
I'm not asking.
I'm telling you!

10:27.919 --> 10:30.832
<i>A commercial jet liner
crashed into the Pentagon earlier</i>

10:30.922 --> 10:32.003
<i>this morning.</i>

10:32.090 --> 10:35.834
<i>An approximately 60-foot section
of this building,</i>

10:35.927 --> 10:37.543
<i>which is, of course, the headquarters</i>

10:37.637 --> 10:41.881
<i>of all the military
for the United States,</i>

10:42.016 --> 10:47.683
<i>was on fire as a result of this crash,
and then collapsed.</i>

10:48.148 --> 10:51.482
<i>All over Washington,
federal buildings are being evacuated.</i>

10:51.568 --> 10:54.311
<i>The Capitol, Department of Justice,
the White House.</i>

10:58.741 --> 11:00.573
Mr. Clarke, we need to leave right away.

11:00.660 --> 11:01.867
Have you reached John O'Neill?

11:01.953 --> 11:03.319
I have called repeatedly, sir.

11:03.413 --> 11:05.621
I just can't get through.
Please, we need to get out.

11:05.707 --> 11:08.700
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Please, sir, they're telling us...

11:08.793 --> 11:10.250
Arthur, go. I'm staying.

11:10.795 --> 11:13.913
Sir, if you don't leave,
then I don't leave.

11:14.007 --> 11:17.796
You have a child at home and a wife.
I don't have either.

11:17.927 --> 11:22.763
I'm ordering you to walk out of here
with the rest of them, now.

11:23.057 --> 11:24.389
All right, sir.

11:35.403 --> 11:37.645
<i>We've been watching this,
here, in the Washington...</i>

11:37.739 --> 11:41.528
This is going to be a very hard day
for US-Saudi relations.

11:41.743 --> 11:44.611
I... Do you mind
if we turn that down, please?

11:44.746 --> 11:46.453
<i>We are all, every one,</i>

11:46.539 --> 11:48.531
<i>I'm sure, on their minds,
is God rest the souls...</i>

11:48.708 --> 11:52.543
You've given me flight manifests
for four domestic flights.

11:52.629 --> 11:53.790
- Yes.
- How do these tell me

11:53.880 --> 11:55.337
that we have a Saudi problem?

11:55.506 --> 11:57.247
I'm looking at names, not nationalities.

11:57.342 --> 11:59.334
We cross-referenced all passenger names

11:59.427 --> 12:02.420
against an Agency database
for known al-Qaeda.

12:02.513 --> 12:04.379
We came up with two.
Both of them were Saudi.

12:04.515 --> 12:06.427
Now, there seems to have been a number

12:06.517 --> 12:11.182
of other Saudis on the four planes,
possibly as many as 15.

12:12.482 --> 12:16.351
And do we know that these two,
or these 15,

12:16.527 --> 12:18.484
are responsible for
what's happening today?

12:18.571 --> 12:20.654
That is the leading assumption, yes,

12:20.740 --> 12:22.697
but the immediate issue
for the administration

12:22.784 --> 12:26.198
is going to be getting our Saudi friends
out of the country.

12:26.287 --> 12:29.451
That includes the royal family,
the ambassador, all associates.

12:29.540 --> 12:34.205
They're going to be in danger
once this leaks out in the press.

12:34.295 --> 12:36.662
Dick, we have to preserve
our relationship

12:36.756 --> 12:38.964
with Saudi Arabia for many reasons.

12:39.050 --> 12:42.384
In the short-term,
to help form a coalition,

12:42.470 --> 12:46.009
and to host a staging ground
for when we do retaliate in the region.

12:46.474 --> 12:49.308
We agree on that, George.

12:49.435 --> 12:53.304
But, if I may,

12:55.942 --> 13:00.027
did you know that these two,
or these 15,

13:00.113 --> 13:02.150
but let's just concentrate
on the two right now...

13:02.240 --> 13:03.822
Did you know
that they were in the country?

13:03.992 --> 13:07.326
Dick, you know as well as I do
that my hair has been on fire

13:07.412 --> 13:09.529
for the entire year over al-Qaeda,

13:09.664 --> 13:11.747
going back to when 43
was first in office.

13:11.833 --> 13:14.826
Before that. This has consumed me.

13:14.919 --> 13:16.251
Four of these flights were domestic,

13:16.337 --> 13:20.001
so, these men had to enter the country
at some point prior to this morning.

13:22.552 --> 13:25.010
How long had they been in the country?

13:26.472 --> 13:29.215
I don't have the answer.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.885
But I'll look into it,
and I'll get back to you.

13:34.689 --> 13:39.024
You do that.
You look into it and get back to me.

13:39.444 --> 13:44.485
I'll go to Condi
and discuss getting the Saudis out,

13:44.574 --> 13:47.191
but this conversation is not over.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.659
What have you done, Soufan?

14:32.580 --> 14:34.993
I need to talk to Abu Jandal.

14:35.792 --> 14:39.376
- Amin is our top man.
- He needs to let me talk to him.

14:39.462 --> 14:41.545
I'm sure he would, if for a reason.

14:41.756 --> 14:44.214
Then you give me Abu Jandal.

14:44.342 --> 14:48.757
- I'm tired of asking.
- This is not the way to ask.

14:53.309 --> 14:55.642
I think Brother John is dead.

14:56.813 --> 15:00.181
Today? In the attack?

15:06.447 --> 15:09.736
- How do you know of this news?
- I don't,

15:10.618 --> 15:12.701
but he was there.

15:13.329 --> 15:14.319
In the building?

15:17.792 --> 15:19.454
I can't reach him.

15:42.108 --> 15:45.226
Come. Come with me.

16:10.761 --> 16:12.673
Copy.

16:15.516 --> 16:17.508
Right this way, ma'am.

16:37.121 --> 16:38.578
Please have a seat.

16:48.799 --> 16:52.543
In the immediate aftermath
of September 11, 2001,

16:52.637 --> 16:54.799
you were placed undercover.
Is that correct?

16:56.599 --> 16:58.056
That is correct.

16:58.142 --> 16:59.633
The reason provided to us

16:59.727 --> 17:04.643
is that a decision was made to shift you
from intelligence to operations.

17:04.732 --> 17:08.146
- Is that correct?
- That is correct.

17:08.236 --> 17:10.522
And that's the reason
you're now being shielded

17:10.613 --> 17:13.651
from public view,
and the view of this commission.

17:13.741 --> 17:17.951
It has nothing to do with protecting you
from public questioning.

17:18.954 --> 17:21.789
Ma'am?

17:21.874 --> 17:26.164
Did you ask me a question?
Because I didn't hear one.

17:30.424 --> 17:32.837
Now, let's move on.

17:32.927 --> 17:34.884
The, uh...

17:34.971 --> 17:39.716
The CIA's intelligence files
on Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi,

17:39.809 --> 17:42.517
two of the hijackers
on September 11, 2001.

17:43.104 --> 17:46.393
It's our understanding that Alec Station

17:46.482 --> 17:48.940
knew of the presence of

17:49.026 --> 17:51.268
these two al-Qaeda members
in the United States,

17:51.362 --> 17:54.776
at least as early as March 2000.

17:54.865 --> 17:58.449
Yet no one alerted the FBI
for 17 months,

17:58.619 --> 18:02.363
and when the FBI was finally
given the files on the two hijackers,

18:02.456 --> 18:05.745
those files were mixed in
with a host of other files,

18:05.835 --> 18:09.670
and never highlighted.
Is that your recollection?

18:12.967 --> 18:14.549
No.

18:14.635 --> 18:16.592
Well, what is your recollection?

18:18.514 --> 18:21.928
I walked those two files
over to the FBI myself.

18:22.018 --> 18:25.602
Yes, this was your response to our
investigators in preliminary session.

18:25.688 --> 18:30.854
But there are physical sign-in logs
at every FBI office in the country,

18:30.943 --> 18:35.028
including Washington, D.C.,
and New York City.

18:35.114 --> 18:38.607
Your name does not appear
in any of those logs.

18:41.787 --> 18:44.780
I walked them over myself.

18:47.376 --> 18:51.791
Freedom itself was attacked this morning
by a faceless coward,

18:53.174 --> 18:56.258
and freedom will be defended.

18:56.427 --> 19:00.091
I want to reassure the American people

19:00.181 --> 19:04.471
that the full resources
of the federal government

19:04.560 --> 19:09.976
are working to assist local authorities
to save lives,

19:10.066 --> 19:15.186
and to help the victims
of these attacks.

19:15.321 --> 19:17.938
Make no mistake,

19:18.032 --> 19:20.445
the United States

19:20.534 --> 19:23.322
will hunt down and punish

19:23.412 --> 19:27.406
those responsible
for these cowardly acts.

19:47.520 --> 19:51.605
- Leonard.
- Martin.

19:51.732 --> 19:53.940
Terrible, unforeseeable tragedy.

19:54.235 --> 19:57.399
- The Pentagon's in...
- "Unforeseeable"?

19:58.906 --> 20:00.192
Some of us have been warning about

20:00.282 --> 20:02.399
the seriousness of this threat
for a long time,

20:02.493 --> 20:04.485
and begging the military to take action.

20:04.578 --> 20:07.070
If you saw these events coming, Martin,
you should have spoken up.

20:07.248 --> 20:09.740
I didn't hear you say a word
about a bunch of goddamn planes

20:09.875 --> 20:12.618
slamming into our skyscrapers,
plunging into the Pentagon.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.203
Or perhaps, I was just out that day?

20:14.714 --> 20:17.878
So, why did you summon me, Leonard?
Surely, not for this.

20:26.016 --> 20:27.598
You need to come back.

20:28.018 --> 20:30.635
- "Back"? Where?
- Alec Station.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.187
In what capacity?

20:33.190 --> 20:34.897
Four planes were hijacked this morning.

20:34.984 --> 20:36.691
Can we not get hung up
on titles right now?

20:36.819 --> 20:38.355
All right, we'll discuss it later,

20:38.446 --> 20:40.312
- but I'll need more funding.
- I understand.

20:40.406 --> 20:42.864
And I want to double the station's size.

20:42.950 --> 20:44.441
- Is that a yes?
- Yes.

20:44.535 --> 20:47.528
And I want recognition within the
Agency, and I hope this administration,

20:47.621 --> 20:49.237
that we're at war. The gloves are off.

20:49.415 --> 20:51.407
No more squeamishness
about the use of force.

20:51.500 --> 20:52.536
I understand.

20:52.668 --> 20:55.251
Say it. We're at war.

20:58.966 --> 21:00.548
We're at war.

21:02.553 --> 21:04.169
I accept your offer.

21:22.490 --> 21:24.322
Back up, back up!

21:24.408 --> 21:26.821
If we're agreed about
the Saudi royal family,

21:26.911 --> 21:29.278
and the intelligence community
clears the names,

21:29.538 --> 21:32.702
please ask the President
for a limited lifting of the flight ban

21:32.792 --> 21:36.832
to allow one or two 747s in the air
in the next day or so.

21:37.838 --> 21:40.125
And both CIA and FBI
have agents on the ground,

21:40.216 --> 21:41.878
trying to nail down concrete evidence

21:41.967 --> 21:45.711
linking these attacks to bin Laden
and al-Qaeda in Afghanistan.

21:46.013 --> 21:48.721
I've heard from Yemen
that we've finally been given access

21:48.933 --> 21:51.391
to certain individuals close to UBL.

21:51.477 --> 21:52.593
We hope to, very soon,

21:52.686 --> 21:55.269
be able to give the Taliban
an ultimatum.

21:55.356 --> 21:56.892
"Give up bin Laden,

21:56.982 --> 21:59.816
"or face the wrath of
the United States military."

22:03.280 --> 22:08.025
Rumsfeld wants the attacks
linked to Saddam Hussein and Iraq.

22:10.287 --> 22:12.279
What did you say?

22:40.651 --> 22:44.270
<i>...near Shanksville,
a small town in Somerset County...</i>

22:44.363 --> 22:46.104
How did this happen, Martin?

22:46.198 --> 22:47.564
<i>South of Pittsburgh,</i>

22:47.658 --> 22:52.369
<i>this is the site of one of the two
United Airlines aircraft...</i>

22:52.496 --> 22:53.987
How did this happen?

22:54.081 --> 22:56.073
<i>...left Newark, New Jersey,
this morning,</i>

22:56.166 --> 22:57.907
<i>on its way to San Francisco.</i>

22:58.043 --> 23:00.410
<i>This is the plane that we know crashed,</i>

23:00.504 --> 23:03.417
<i>and you just,
with David Mattingly's report,</i>

23:03.507 --> 23:04.873
<i>looking at the site</i>

23:05.009 --> 23:07.752
<i>where this plane came down,
and we don't know where...</i>

23:07.845 --> 23:11.839
We're gonna fix things.
We're gonna make it all right.

23:11.974 --> 23:13.510
<i>...what their target was...</i>

25:29.528 --> 25:30.564
Heather.

25:32.489 --> 25:33.570
Hello?

25:33.741 --> 25:35.698
<i>Ali, it's Vince.</i>

25:36.201 --> 25:38.693
I'm calling, I...

25:38.787 --> 25:41.154
I haven't been able
to get ahold of John.

25:44.668 --> 25:47.627
Ali, have you heard from John?

25:48.130 --> 25:49.120
No.

25:52.009 --> 25:55.798
The station chief handed me
surveillance photos from Malaysia.

25:56.138 --> 26:00.257
<i>I've been asking Alec Station
about Malaysia for a year now, Vince.</i>

26:00.768 --> 26:02.930
Did you know about any of this?

26:03.395 --> 26:05.603
Oh, God. Oh, man, uh...

26:08.859 --> 26:12.102
I didn't know what I knew.

26:12.196 --> 26:13.403
I...

26:16.658 --> 26:20.242
Look, they were threatening me.

26:20.329 --> 26:22.946
<i>They control all the information.
They're...</i>

26:28.128 --> 26:30.245
Ali?

26:31.882 --> 26:34.124
Ali?

27:34.611 --> 27:36.102
Okay, now.

27:47.541 --> 27:49.248
General.

27:53.338 --> 27:55.876
I don't trust myself.

29:28.183 --> 29:29.219
<i>Hello?</i>

29:29.309 --> 29:33.303
Liz, it's Bobby. Bob Ches...

30:59.066 --> 31:01.900
- Thank you.
- Of course.

31:05.113 --> 31:06.695
Are you okay?

31:15.499 --> 31:17.582
I don't know.

31:19.336 --> 31:20.326
Liz,

31:21.088 --> 31:23.546
I've been trying to reach John all day.

31:25.550 --> 31:26.882
I never could.

31:28.011 --> 31:33.257
I mean,
I gave up after the second tower.

31:33.350 --> 31:35.091
When it...

31:40.273 --> 31:43.732
Nobody's seen John.

31:45.404 --> 31:48.112
Nobody's seen him.

31:49.449 --> 31:51.566
Have you heard from him?

31:56.540 --> 31:57.747
Come.

32:08.427 --> 32:10.635
<i>Hey, baby,
there's something going on down here.</i>

32:10.720 --> 32:13.303
<i>An explosion, or something in Tower One.</i>

32:13.390 --> 32:16.007
<i>There's just a massive hole
up near the top.</i>

32:16.101 --> 32:17.342
<i>I gotta go get people out.</i>

32:18.478 --> 32:22.062
<i>Gosh, I keep thinking of you at 18,
up there with your parents,</i>

32:22.149 --> 32:24.562
<i>gazing out the window
at New York Harbor.</i>

32:24.651 --> 32:27.644
<i>Listen, as soon as they fix this thing,
you and me are gonna go back up there.</i>

32:27.737 --> 32:30.354
<i>We're gonna get ourselves a table,
right next... Hey, Petey!</i>

32:30.490 --> 32:32.903
<i>What are they telling you?</i>

32:33.034 --> 32:34.821
<i>I gotta go, sweetheart.
I'll call you later.</i>

32:34.911 --> 32:36.402
<i>Pete! Let's try to...</i>
