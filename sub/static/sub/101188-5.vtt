WEBVTT

00:00.083 --> 00:04.379
...longtime friend, Patty Palm,
22-year-old...

00:04.463 --> 00:06.131
Diana is missing.

00:07.674 --> 00:09.593
She was supposed to go to our house

00:09.676 --> 00:13.722
on Tuesday morning to help my
son with the air conditioner,

00:13.805 --> 00:15.182
and she didn't show up.
- Hello?

00:15.265 --> 00:16.558
- Hi, Cody,

00:16.642 --> 00:18.852
I have Phil Goldman for you.
- Who?

00:18.936 --> 00:22.648
- Phil Goldman, bitch!
What's up? I'm your new agent.

00:22.731 --> 00:25.192
Hey! I'm sorry.
I don't know if you've heard,

00:25.275 --> 00:26.610
but Jason Levy

00:26.693 --> 00:29.738
was recently #MeToo'd, so
he's no longer with the company.

00:29.821 --> 00:32.699
- Oh. Oh, my God.
- Yeah, so it's me and you.

00:32.783 --> 00:34.910
I'm your agent, you're my client.
What's up?

00:34.993 --> 00:38.163
- Okay, that's a little weird
'cause I never even met Jason,

00:38.247 --> 00:39.373
so...
- No, I know.

00:39.456 --> 00:41.083
Nobody's really met him.
Who cares?

00:41.166 --> 00:43.168
Yeah, anyway, listen, sorry it's so late.

00:43.252 --> 00:45.462
I've taken over his whole
roster, so I'm making my way

00:45.546 --> 00:47.381
through the list,
and you're the last one on it.

00:47.464 --> 00:49.466
- Oh, okay.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.343
- Yeah, uh, I'm sure it's alphabetical.

00:51.426 --> 00:53.262
Yeah, or-or by talent.

00:53.345 --> 00:54.847
I'm kidding.

00:54.930 --> 00:56.306
Who knows? Anyway...
- Okay.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.976
- Listen, we got a lot of shows
staffing right now,

00:59.059 --> 01:02.563
and they're looking
for lady writers, yeah.

01:02.646 --> 01:05.607
The problem is I don't have
a current sample from you,

01:05.691 --> 01:08.861
so if you could shoot something
over to me ASAP Rocky,

01:08.944 --> 01:11.029
that'd be great.
- Um... yeah.

01:11.113 --> 01:14.032
Um, I'm just working on this,
uh, thing about the tooth fairy.

01:14.116 --> 01:15.284
- Oh, the tooth fairy!
- Yeah...

01:15.367 --> 01:16.743
- I fucking love that shit.

01:16.827 --> 01:19.788
- Like, she's the tooth fairy,
but then she's also a stripper

01:19.872 --> 01:21.206
because, you know, like,

01:21.290 --> 01:22.875
dollar bills.
- Yeah!

01:22.958 --> 01:25.335
Yeah, dollar bills,
I fucking love that shit.

01:25.419 --> 01:28.964
I love that. It's so good.
That's such originality. I mean,

01:29.047 --> 01:31.008
it's probably 'cause you're
Dan Harmon's girlfriend.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.801
That guy's such a fucking genius.

01:32.885 --> 01:35.721
- Yeah, he-he's super great.
- Yeah, he's super great.

01:35.804 --> 01:39.308
Listen, if he's ever unhappy
with his current representation,

01:39.391 --> 01:41.977
it would be my honor-- honor--

01:42.060 --> 01:43.812
to take him on as a client,
you know what I mean?

01:43.896 --> 01:45.355
- I will definitely let him know.

01:45.439 --> 01:47.733
- Uh, yeah, please, let him know. Oh.

01:47.816 --> 01:49.484
Fuck me in the dickhole.

01:49.568 --> 01:52.738
I got to take this right away, okay?
It's Jason Levy.

01:52.821 --> 01:55.115
We're still kind of friends,
and I don't know,

01:55.199 --> 01:56.575
I think he might hurt himself tonight,

01:56.658 --> 01:58.076
if you know what I mean, kill himself.

01:58.160 --> 02:00.621
I think he might commit suicide.
I'm gonna take this.

02:00.704 --> 02:02.497
Just send me some of your writing shit,

02:02.581 --> 02:04.124
and then I'm gonna check it out,

02:04.208 --> 02:06.084
and, uh, we'll go from there,
all right, babe?

02:06.168 --> 02:09.213
Buh-bye!
- Okay, bye.

02:27.231 --> 02:28.982
Cody!

02:31.443 --> 02:35.405
What you doing up there?

02:35.489 --> 02:38.700
Are you working on your pilot?

02:38.784 --> 02:40.452
So exciting!

02:40.536 --> 02:44.581
Is it the one about the stripper
who's also the tooth fairy?

02:44.665 --> 02:47.835
That's such a fun idea.

02:47.918 --> 02:50.629
It's so broad, but, like, honestly,

02:50.712 --> 02:55.133
Middle America loves
shitty broad stuff, but, like,

02:55.217 --> 02:57.135
I love it.

02:57.219 --> 03:00.931
- Are you stuck?
Maybe I can help.

03:03.976 --> 03:06.770
- Hey. I don't want your help.
You're a fucking dick.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.480
- Is this about the whole
"trying to sabotage

03:08.564 --> 03:09.815
your relationship with Dan" thing?

03:09.898 --> 03:11.108
Because, Cody, I'm so sorry.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.734
That was my bad.

03:12.818 --> 03:15.237
I had so much internalized misogyny.

03:15.320 --> 03:16.738
- Are you kidding?
You're obviously just trying

03:16.822 --> 03:18.782
to get me to take you
out of the dumpster.

03:18.866 --> 03:22.244
- What? No. No, seriously,
I love it down here.

03:22.327 --> 03:23.537
I really do.
- Really?

03:23.620 --> 03:26.081
- Yeah. Cody, actually,
I met someone.

03:26.164 --> 03:28.500
His name's Harold.
He's a piece of wood.

03:28.584 --> 03:30.210
What, babe?

03:30.294 --> 03:32.504
Okay, yeah,
he wants me to tell you

03:32.588 --> 03:34.131
he identifies as lumber.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.300
He's so hot, Cody.

03:36.383 --> 03:39.178
He has this, like, knot
that's-that's so sexy in, like,

03:39.261 --> 03:40.512
a Joaquin Phoenix sort of like...

03:40.596 --> 03:41.722
- Barbara.
- What?

03:41.805 --> 03:43.932
- I'm so happy for both of you.
Congratulations.

03:44.016 --> 03:45.350
I have to work.
- Wait!

03:45.434 --> 03:46.518
I know why you're stuck!

03:46.602 --> 03:49.229
It's because you have
a passive protagonist.

03:49.313 --> 03:51.064
You know what I would do?

03:51.148 --> 03:52.858
Okay, so hear me out,

03:52.941 --> 03:55.235
we start with, like,
a cross-cutty montage,

03:55.319 --> 03:57.112
the music kicks in, we're seeing stuff,

03:57.196 --> 03:59.990
images, but none of it really
matters, because guess what?

04:00.073 --> 04:01.617
Boom! We're in.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.619
We're fucking watching this show.
- Yeah.

04:03.702 --> 04:05.120
Intense close-ups,

04:05.204 --> 04:07.414
just, like, for no reason,
but you're just watching it,

04:07.497 --> 04:08.665
and you're in it.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.876
- What if the guy has
that disease where, like...

04:10.959 --> 04:12.836
- Overlapping dialogue. They're
just talking over each other.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.671
- She's not passive, she's reactive.

04:14.755 --> 04:15.881
Making the audience think

04:15.964 --> 04:17.508
something is happening, but really,

04:17.591 --> 04:19.635
nothing is happening,
but everything is happening.

04:19.718 --> 04:21.762
- "You know I only take
baby teeth," but he's like,

04:21.845 --> 04:23.639
"These are baby teeth,"
you know, so it's like,

04:23.722 --> 04:25.557
he has the disease,
but it's also a metaphor

04:25.641 --> 04:28.393
for his immaturity kind of, you know?

04:28.477 --> 04:30.270
I mean, if you think
that's dumb, or, like,

04:30.354 --> 04:31.939
if it feels forced...

04:32.022 --> 04:34.358
Barbara?
- Cody!

04:36.276 --> 04:38.278
- Barbara!

04:44.660 --> 04:47.287
Dan.

04:49.581 --> 04:51.166
Um...

04:51.250 --> 04:53.460
I think I'm getting a UTI
and I just feel gross,

04:53.544 --> 04:56.421
so I'm just gonna sleep
at my house. I love you. Bye.

05:02.261 --> 05:03.804
Cody!

05:03.887 --> 05:07.599
- Barbara!
- Cody...!

05:07.683 --> 05:08.851
- Stop!

05:08.934 --> 05:12.563
I'm sorry. Stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop. Oh, my gosh.

05:12.646 --> 05:15.232
There's-there's been a mistake.
I didn't mean to throw her away.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.442
- Oh, my God, Cody,
he was totally gonna rape me.
- What's up?

05:17.526 --> 05:19.862
- This sex doll, she's-she's mine.

05:19.945 --> 05:21.405
She got thrown away accidentally.

05:21.488 --> 05:22.865
I just, I just need her back.

05:22.948 --> 05:24.324
- Why are you so out of breath?

05:24.408 --> 05:26.243
- How do you accidentally
throw away a sex doll?

05:26.326 --> 05:29.371
- It-it was a mistake, sir.
People make mistakes, okay?

05:29.454 --> 05:32.291
You were the one about to fuck
a used sex doll. Are you okay?

05:32.374 --> 05:35.252
- Excuse me?
I was gonna recycle her.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.004
I'm not some pervert.

05:37.087 --> 05:39.965
- Okay, okay, well, I mean,

05:40.048 --> 05:42.134
I-I don't think we necessarily
need to, like, cast judgments

05:42.217 --> 05:43.635
on other people's sexuality, like...

05:43.719 --> 05:45.179
Okay, Cody, you're making it worse.

05:45.262 --> 05:47.222
- Can I just, um,
give you some cash for her?

05:47.306 --> 05:49.183
- I don't do this work for the money.

05:49.266 --> 05:52.102
I do it because I give a fuck
about the environment, man.

05:52.186 --> 05:54.813
- Yeah, right.
- Oh, um, I'm sorry.

05:54.897 --> 05:56.481
That's fair.
- Do you know how many dolphins

05:56.565 --> 05:59.985
die each year from choking
on used sex dolls?

06:00.068 --> 06:01.320
- No.

06:01.403 --> 06:03.030
- Me, neither.
It's gonna be zero if I have

06:03.113 --> 06:04.907
anything to say about it.
- No, no, no, no!

06:04.990 --> 06:06.825
Don't let him take me!
- Okay, sir. No, hey, hey. I...

06:06.909 --> 06:08.327
Please, I appreciate your position,

06:08.410 --> 06:11.121
and I think what you're doing
is very noble, and, you know,

06:11.205 --> 06:12.873
it's like a service to the community.

06:12.956 --> 06:13.957
- Who cares?

06:14.041 --> 06:15.459
- Barbara, can you let me handle this?

06:15.542 --> 06:17.044
I really need her back.

06:17.127 --> 06:20.214
She's my writing partner.

06:27.387 --> 06:30.724
- What even are all these water bottles?

06:30.807 --> 06:32.809
- I don't know, man,
they're just, like, accumulated

06:32.893 --> 06:34.811
from-from hikes and stuff.

06:34.895 --> 06:37.022
- From hikes? You don't hike.

06:37.105 --> 06:38.565
- Oh, this is plenty.

06:38.649 --> 06:40.067
Here.

06:42.277 --> 06:44.363
- Thank you.
- Bye.

06:44.446 --> 06:45.989
Have such a great night,

06:46.073 --> 06:48.408
and thank you so much
for not raping me.

06:48.492 --> 06:51.578
Cody, thank you for saving me.

06:51.662 --> 06:53.830
You're truly such a great friend.

06:53.914 --> 06:57.084
Okay, but just so we're clear,
we're just writing,

06:57.167 --> 06:59.628
that's the whole thing.
- Yeah, no, totally. 100%.

06:59.711 --> 07:02.506
But, like, we're not starting now, right?

07:02.589 --> 07:04.800
Like, I don't know if you
noticed, I just went through

07:04.883 --> 07:06.343
a very traumatic experience,

07:06.426 --> 07:08.220
and, like, I need a second
to decompress.

07:08.303 --> 07:10.097
- Okay. That's fine.

07:10.180 --> 07:12.599
- So where are we going?
Are we gonna go stay at your place?

07:14.268 --> 07:16.603
- Yeah, I guess, I mean,
I can't take you back in there.

07:16.687 --> 07:18.063
- Oh, yeah.

07:18.146 --> 07:21.692
Fuck Dan. He can eat my ass,
not in a hot way-- I hate him.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.777
- Okay.

07:23.861 --> 07:25.237
Let's go.
- Hey, so I told Harold

07:25.320 --> 07:27.531
he could crash with us for a few
nights. I hope that's okay.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.783
He's fighting with him mom.
He just needs a place to go

07:29.867 --> 07:31.451
where he can, like, get his shit together

07:31.535 --> 07:34.413
and get through this family stuff.
