WEBVTT

02:13.425 --> 02:14.426
Stop now.

02:15.344 --> 02:17.062
Tell me where it is.

02:22.267 --> 02:26.568
You and your brethren possess
what is not rightfully yours.

02:27.356 --> 02:31.077
I don't know what you are talking about.

02:31.443 --> 02:34.117
Is it a secret you will die for?

02:35.113 --> 02:37.161
- Please.
- As you wish.

02:38.033 --> 02:39.410
Wait!

02:43.413 --> 02:45.586
My God, forgive me.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.215
In the sacristy,

02:49.670 --> 02:53.140
the church of Saint-Sulpice,
is the Rose Line.

02:53.215 --> 02:55.138
Beneath the Rose.

02:57.594 --> 02:58.971
Thank you.

03:33.004 --> 03:34.130
Thank you.

03:35.132 --> 03:36.133
Thank you.

03:47.269 --> 03:52.241
Symbols are a language
that can help us understand our past.

03:52.774 --> 03:56.950
As the saying goes,
a picture says a thousand words,

03:57.028 --> 04:00.032
but which words?

04:01.074 --> 04:04.749
Interpret for me, please, this symbol.
First thing that comes to mind. Anybody?

04:04.828 --> 04:07.172
- Hatred, racism.
- Ku Klux Klan.

04:07.289 --> 04:12.671
Yes, yes, interesting.
But they would disagree with you in Spain.

04:12.794 --> 04:16.094
There, they are robes worn by priests.

04:16.548 --> 04:18.676
Now this symbol. Anyone?

04:18.884 --> 04:19.885
Evil.

04:21.136 --> 04:22.388
In English, please.

04:22.512 --> 04:23.729
Devil's pitchfork.

04:23.805 --> 04:26.024
Poor, poor Poseidon.

04:26.641 --> 04:28.314
That is his trident.

04:28.393 --> 04:32.193
A symbol of power
to millions of the ancients.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.444
Now this symbol.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.656
- Madonna and child.
- Faith. Christianity.

04:36.777 --> 04:40.372
No. No, it's the pagan god Horus
and his mother Isis

04:40.447 --> 04:43.417
centuries before the birth of Christ.

04:43.492 --> 04:47.292
Understanding our past determines actively

04:47.370 --> 04:50.590
our ability to understand the present.

04:50.665 --> 04:54.841
So how do we sift truth from belief?

04:55.545 --> 04:58.890
How do we write our own histories,
personally or culturally,

04:58.965 --> 05:01.138
and thereby define ourselves?

05:01.218 --> 05:06.019
How do we penetrate years, centuries,
of historical distortion

05:06.097 --> 05:09.226
to find original truth?

05:09.392 --> 05:12.737
Tonight, this will be our quest.

05:12.854 --> 05:15.858
My son is a student of yours at Harvard.

05:15.941 --> 05:18.319
- Michael Culp? He adores you.
- Yeah.

05:18.401 --> 05:20.495
He says you're the best teacher
he's ever had.

05:20.570 --> 05:24.370
Ms. Culp, I think I already gave
Michael an A-minus.

05:24.908 --> 05:26.376
He told me. Thank you.

05:26.451 --> 05:27.919
Mr. Langdon?

05:28.453 --> 05:29.921
Hi.

05:29.996 --> 05:31.418
Bonjour, Professor.

05:32.249 --> 05:37.426
I'm Lieutenant Collet from DCPJ.
A kind of French FBI.

05:38.088 --> 05:40.762
Will you take a look at this photo, please?

05:40.841 --> 05:43.845
My police chief, Captain Fache, had hoped,

05:43.927 --> 05:47.352
considering your expertise
and the markings on the body,

05:47.430 --> 05:48.932
you might assist us.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.701
Will you excuse me a moment?

06:03.238 --> 06:05.206
I was supposed to have drinks with him
earlier this evening.

06:05.282 --> 06:06.454
Yes, we know.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.957
We found your name in his daily planner.

06:11.121 --> 06:13.874
He never showed. I waited for over an hour.

06:17.127 --> 06:19.801
Why would someone do this to him?

06:19.963 --> 06:22.557
You misunderstand, Professor.

06:23.466 --> 06:25.719
He was shot, yes.

06:25.802 --> 06:28.555
But what you see in the photograph,

06:28.638 --> 06:31.107
Monsieur Saunière did to himself.

06:34.311 --> 06:38.657
Teacher, all four are dead.

06:39.482 --> 06:42.577
The sénéchaux and the Grand Master himself.

06:42.736 --> 06:45.831
Then I assume you have the location.

06:45.989 --> 06:49.118
Confirmed by all.

06:49.284 --> 06:51.707
Independently.

06:52.495 --> 06:56.841
I had feared the Priory's penchant
for secrecy might prevail.

07:00.337 --> 07:04.467
The prospect of death is strong motivation.

07:07.886 --> 07:10.309
It is here.

07:10.555 --> 07:13.024
In Paris, Teacher.

07:13.934 --> 07:19.407
It hides beneath the Rose in Saint-Sulpice.

07:19.898 --> 07:22.651
You will go forth, Silas.

08:35.597 --> 08:39.102
I chastise my body.

09:16.848 --> 09:18.976
Captain Fache is waiting for you.

09:27.317 --> 09:28.614
Okay.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.335
- Mr. Langdon.
- Yes.

09:41.873 --> 09:43.796
I'm Captain Bezu Fache.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.336
You like our pyramid?

09:46.419 --> 09:47.511
It's magnificent.

09:48.338 --> 09:50.215
A scar on the face of Paris.

09:51.382 --> 09:53.180
After me, please.

10:00.892 --> 10:03.020
It's the pairing of those two pyramids.

10:03.520 --> 10:04.942
It's unique.

10:05.021 --> 10:07.194
The two are geometric echoes.

10:07.357 --> 10:08.358
Fascinating.

10:11.069 --> 10:14.619
I'm not sure how much help
I'm gonna be here this evening.

10:15.323 --> 10:17.951
How well did you know the curator?

10:18.034 --> 10:19.331
Not very well.

10:19.410 --> 10:23.005
Frankly, I was surprised
when he contacted me.

10:31.047 --> 10:33.425
Could we take the stairs?

10:48.022 --> 10:51.401
So Saunière requested tonight's meeting.

10:51.484 --> 10:52.610
Yes.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.287
How? Did he call you?

10:55.947 --> 10:59.201
E-mail. He heard I was in Paris.

11:00.493 --> 11:03.463
- Had something to discuss.
- What?

11:08.418 --> 11:11.217
You seem uncomfortable.

11:22.891 --> 11:27.067
The Grande Galerie.
This is where you found the body.

11:27.145 --> 11:28.943
How would you know that?

11:29.939 --> 11:33.034
I recognize the parquet floor
from the Polaroid.

11:33.109 --> 11:34.656
It's unmistakable.

11:43.995 --> 11:45.292
Dear God.

11:49.292 --> 11:51.670
Let's cover the talking points again,
Your Eminence.

11:51.753 --> 11:54.848
Many call Opus Dei a brainwashing cult.

11:54.964 --> 11:57.683
Others, an ultraconservative
Christian secret society.

11:57.759 --> 12:00.228
Obviously, some people fear
what they don't understand.

12:00.303 --> 12:02.726
Perhaps a less defensive tack, Your Eminence.

12:02.805 --> 12:04.933
The press continue to be harsh with us.

12:06.768 --> 12:10.693
We are not Cafeteria Catholics.

12:11.147 --> 12:13.320
We don't pick and choose
which rules to follow.

12:13.399 --> 12:16.027
We follow doctrine. Rigorously.

12:16.819 --> 12:20.915
Does doctrine necessarily include
vows of chastity, tithing,

12:20.990 --> 12:24.119
and atonement for sins
through self-flagellation and the cilice?

12:24.494 --> 12:28.624
Many of our followers are married.
Many of them have families.

12:28.831 --> 12:31.675
Only a small proportion
choose to live ascetic lives.

12:31.876 --> 12:34.846
- Why are some media...
- That will be all, Michael, thank you.

12:35.380 --> 12:36.597
Aringarosa.

12:37.840 --> 12:41.515
Silas has succeeded. The legend is true.

12:41.844 --> 12:43.721
It hides beneath the Rose.

12:44.013 --> 12:47.062
My part of our bargain is nearly fulfilled.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.695
I meet the council in an hour.

12:50.937 --> 12:54.692
I will have your money tonight, Teacher.

12:55.024 --> 12:57.493
The Vitruvian Man.

12:57.568 --> 13:00.196
It's one of Leonardo da Vinci's
most famous sketches.

13:00.905 --> 13:02.873
And the star on his skin?

13:03.700 --> 13:06.044
- A pentacle.
- And its meaning?

13:06.452 --> 13:08.546
The pentacle is a pagan religious icon.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.795
Devil worship.

13:10.873 --> 13:15.219
No. No, no, no. The pentacle before that.

13:16.045 --> 13:18.423
This is a symbol for Venus.

13:19.173 --> 13:21.517
It represents the female half of all things.

13:21.592 --> 13:24.562
You are telling me
that Saunière's last act on earth

13:24.637 --> 13:28.733
was to draw a goddess symbol
on his chest? Why?

13:30.184 --> 13:33.438
Captain Fache,
obviously I can't tell you why.

13:34.355 --> 13:38.610
I can tell you he, as well as anyone,
knows the meaning of this symbol,

13:38.693 --> 13:40.991
and it has nothing to do
with worshiping the devil.

13:41.070 --> 13:42.572
- Is that so?
- Yes.

13:42.655 --> 13:46.876
Then what do you make of this?

13:47.452 --> 13:51.423
"O, Draconian devil. Oh, lame saint."

13:51.914 --> 13:54.758
It's a phrase.
Doesn't mean anything, not to me.

13:55.418 --> 13:59.013
What would you do if you had
such limited time to send a message?

14:00.465 --> 14:05.062
Well, I suppose I'd try
to identify my killer.

14:05.928 --> 14:07.054
Precisely.

14:07.764 --> 14:09.391
Precisely.

14:09.474 --> 14:10.600
So, Professor...

14:12.143 --> 14:14.237
Officer Neveu.

14:14.312 --> 14:15.939
Please, pardon the interruption.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.023
This is not the time.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.443
I received the crime-scene jpegs
at headquarters...

14:19.609 --> 14:21.452
...and I've deciphered the code.

14:21.778 --> 14:23.371
It's a Fibonacci sequence.

14:23.529 --> 14:24.997
That's the code Saunière left on the floor.

14:25.073 --> 14:26.074
Fibonacci?

14:26.282 --> 14:28.410
Headquarters sent me to explain, captain.

14:28.493 --> 14:29.961
It is the Fibonacci sequence.

14:30.036 --> 14:31.379
The numbers are out of order.

14:31.454 --> 14:34.458
But before that, I have an urgent message for
Professor Langdon.

14:34.540 --> 14:35.587
Right?

14:36.167 --> 14:37.419
Pardon me?

14:39.796 --> 14:42.925
I'm Sophie Neveu, French police, Cryptology.

14:43.049 --> 14:45.051
Your embassy called Division.

14:49.889 --> 14:54.144
I'm sorry, monsieur, they said
it was a matter of life and death.

14:55.061 --> 14:58.031
This is the number
of your embassy's messaging service.

14:59.065 --> 15:00.442
Well, thank you.

15:07.824 --> 15:09.997
Hello, you've reached
the home of Sophie Neveu.

15:10.827 --> 15:14.081
Miss Neveu? This...

15:14.163 --> 15:15.415
No. That's the right number.

15:15.498 --> 15:17.921
You have to dial an access code
to pick up your messages.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.092
But I'm getting...

15:19.168 --> 15:22.047
It's a three-digit code.
It's on the paper I gave you.

15:31.264 --> 15:34.438
Professor Langdon,
do not react to this message.

15:34.517 --> 15:37.111
You must follow my directions very closely

15:37.186 --> 15:40.406
and, above all,
reveal nothing to Captain Fache.

15:40.481 --> 15:42.529
You are in grave danger.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.502
Church of Saint-Sulpice.

15:57.707 --> 15:59.380
Good evening, Sister.

16:00.376 --> 16:04.176
I need you to show someone
our church tonight.

16:04.547 --> 16:06.015
Of course, Father.

16:06.549 --> 16:08.222
But so late?

16:09.469 --> 16:10.470
Wouldn't tomorrow...?

16:10.636 --> 16:15.392
This is a request from an
important bishop of Opus Dei.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.569
It would be my pleasure.

16:42.418 --> 16:45.592
There's been an accident. A friend.

16:45.671 --> 16:49.141
- I have to fly home in the morning.
- I see.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.185
Is there a restroom I could use?

16:51.260 --> 16:53.513
I just wanna splash some water on my face.

16:53.596 --> 16:54.768
Yes.

16:56.891 --> 16:59.690
She said it is meaningless.

17:00.478 --> 17:02.276
A mathematical joke.

17:03.272 --> 17:05.115
Is it meaningless?

17:07.777 --> 17:09.871
I'll take another look when I come back.

17:13.741 --> 17:16.164
I'm sorry. Of course.

17:30.132 --> 17:32.351
Do you have a message from Saunière?

17:33.052 --> 17:34.679
What are you talking about?

17:35.805 --> 17:37.273
Crazy old man.

17:37.473 --> 17:40.067
You have me confused with someone else.

17:40.268 --> 17:42.270
- I came here to...
- Check your jacket pocket.

17:43.563 --> 17:44.860
Just look.

17:48.943 --> 17:50.661
GPS tracking dot.

17:50.820 --> 17:53.994
Accurate within two feet
anywhere on the globe.

17:54.073 --> 17:57.122
The agent who picked you up
slipped it into your jacket

17:59.078 --> 18:01.172
in case you tried to run.

18:02.707 --> 18:05.335
We have you on a little leash, Professor.

18:05.668 --> 18:07.670
Why would I try to run? I didn't do anything.

18:07.795 --> 18:11.925
So, what do you think about
the fourth line of text

18:12.008 --> 18:14.887
Fache wiped clean before you arrived?

18:20.975 --> 18:24.605
He brought you here to force
a confession, Professor Langdon.

18:28.274 --> 18:31.027
He's still in there? What's he doing?

18:31.110 --> 18:34.614
Fache isn't even looking
for other suspects, okay?

18:34.697 --> 18:36.199
He is sure you're guilty.

18:39.827 --> 18:42.421
When did Saunière contact you?

18:42.622 --> 18:43.965
- Today?
- Yes, yes.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.042
What time? What time?

18:46.125 --> 18:48.344
At 3:00. Around 3:00. 3:00.

18:48.419 --> 18:52.219
We call Fache "the Bull."
Once he starts, he doesn't stop.

18:52.340 --> 18:55.640
He can arrest you and detain you
for months while he builds a case.

18:55.718 --> 18:59.143
And by then whatever Saunière
wanted you to tell me will be useless.

18:59.221 --> 19:01.565
Lady, stop it! Just stop!

19:01.974 --> 19:03.476
Who are you?

19:08.397 --> 19:10.240
Look at the letters.

19:11.484 --> 19:12.952
"P.S."

19:13.361 --> 19:15.034
P.S., postscript.

19:16.405 --> 19:19.249
"Princess Sophie." Silly, I know.

19:19.325 --> 19:22.078
But I was only a girl when I lived with him.

19:25.498 --> 19:28.047
Jacques Saunière was my grandfather.

19:33.214 --> 19:36.559
Apparently, it was his dying wish
that we meet.

19:38.344 --> 19:40.688
If you help me understand why

19:40.763 --> 19:44.438
I will get you to your embassy,
where we cannot arrest you.

19:45.685 --> 19:48.438
Fache was never gonna let me
just stroll out of here, was he?

19:49.146 --> 19:50.443
No.

19:51.357 --> 19:55.157
If we are to get away from here,
we must find another way.

20:03.953 --> 20:06.251
What exactly do you propose?

20:15.798 --> 20:18.642
Saunière was reading his book.

20:19.051 --> 20:21.019
"Blood trail."

20:23.013 --> 20:24.856
Excuse me, captain.

20:25.141 --> 20:27.109
We have a problem.

20:27.309 --> 20:30.313
Headquarters didn't send Sophie Neveu.

20:32.523 --> 20:33.740
What?

20:33.899 --> 20:37.324
Captain, look at this.

20:38.904 --> 20:40.156
He jumped!

20:40.740 --> 20:41.832
Shit.

20:43.993 --> 20:47.167
He's moving again. And fast.

20:48.748 --> 20:49.920
He must be in a car.

20:51.083 --> 20:55.304
He's going south on Pont du Carrousel.

21:04.013 --> 21:05.310
Bastard.

21:28.871 --> 21:31.590
That cop will check the whole lower floor.

21:35.544 --> 21:37.842
I will only take a moment.

21:38.339 --> 21:39.591
Of course.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.480
He is much older than I remember.

22:02.238 --> 22:05.617
I hadn't seen or spoken to him
in a very long time.

22:14.750 --> 22:18.721
He phoned my office today. Several times.

22:19.922 --> 22:22.926
He said it was a matter of life and death.

22:23.425 --> 22:26.770
I thought it was another trick
to get back in touch.

22:29.431 --> 22:32.230
It seems when he couldn't speak to me,

22:33.477 --> 22:35.479
he reached out to you.

22:52.538 --> 22:54.916
- Wait a minute.
- Professor?

22:56.625 --> 22:59.879
This is wrong. Yeah. See? This is wrong.

23:01.547 --> 23:05.142
The Fibonacci numbers only make sense
when they're in order.

23:05.217 --> 23:06.764
These are scrambled.

23:06.844 --> 23:10.599
If he was trying to reach out,
maybe he was doing it in code.

23:10.681 --> 23:12.558
Would you hold this, please?

23:15.102 --> 23:16.979
This phrase is meaningless.

23:19.023 --> 23:23.620
Unless you assume these letters
are out of order too.

23:23.694 --> 23:24.866
An anagram.

23:36.624 --> 23:38.422
You have eidetic memory?

23:38.709 --> 23:42.259
Not quite.
But I can pretty much remember what I see.

24:03.651 --> 24:05.574
Anagram is right.

24:06.987 --> 24:09.536
"O, Draconian devil. Oh, lame saint" becomes

24:09.615 --> 24:12.243
"Leonardo da Vinci. The Mona Lisa."

24:12.576 --> 24:16.251
Professor, the Mona Lisa is right over here.

24:22.753 --> 24:27.725
Look at this. He must have
thrown it from the window.

24:28.050 --> 24:29.677
Smart to hit the truck.

24:30.052 --> 24:33.602
What, you admire him now?

24:35.224 --> 24:37.318
We're stupid. Who did we leave at the museum?

24:37.476 --> 24:40.229
Ledoux? Get him on the radio!

24:40.479 --> 24:43.528
Her smile is in the lower
spatial frequencies.

24:43.607 --> 24:47.407
The horizon is significantly lower
on the left than it is on the right.

24:47.486 --> 24:48.612
Why?

24:48.696 --> 24:52.200
Well, see, she appears larger
from the left than on the right.

24:52.282 --> 24:55.456
Historically, the left was female,
the right was male.

24:55.536 --> 24:57.254
There. Blood.

25:05.713 --> 25:06.839
Hey.

25:08.507 --> 25:11.135
"So dark the con of man."

25:11.927 --> 25:15.272
No. It doesn't say that.

25:15.431 --> 25:17.775
Is it another anagram? Can you break it?

25:22.688 --> 25:25.157
Professor, hurry. Hurry!

25:26.817 --> 25:29.787
Moon. Sermon. Charms.

25:29.987 --> 25:33.958
Demons. Omens. Codes. Monks. Ranks. Rocks.

25:34.033 --> 25:35.285
Madonna of the Rocks.

25:36.035 --> 25:37.127
Da Vinci.

25:47.504 --> 25:49.256
Careful. Careful.

25:56.680 --> 26:00.560
This can't be this. The fleur-de-lis.

26:40.390 --> 26:42.063
It was Saunière's.

26:42.684 --> 26:45.654
I remember finding it once when I was a girl.

26:46.522 --> 26:48.741
He'd promised he'd give it to me one day.

26:49.525 --> 26:51.869
Have you ever heard
those words before, Sophie?

26:51.944 --> 26:53.446
"So dark the con of man"?

26:53.529 --> 26:55.156
No. Have you?

26:55.239 --> 26:58.869
When you were a child,
were you aware of any secret gatherings?

26:59.993 --> 27:02.371
Anything ritualistic in nature?

27:02.538 --> 27:05.792
Meetings your grandfather
would've wanted kept secret?

27:05.999 --> 27:09.503
Was there ever any talk of something
called the Priory of Sion?

27:09.628 --> 27:12.552
The what? Why are you asking these things?

27:12.756 --> 27:15.805
The Priory of Sion is a myth.

27:15.884 --> 27:18.137
One of the world's oldest
and most secret societies,

27:18.220 --> 27:22.726
with leaders like Sir Isaac Newton,
da Vinci himself.

27:23.058 --> 27:24.901
The fleur-de-lis is their crest.

27:24.977 --> 27:27.696
They're guardians of a secret
they supposedly refer to

27:27.771 --> 27:30.024
as "the dark con of man."

27:30.566 --> 27:31.988
But what secret?

27:32.526 --> 27:37.828
The Priory of Sion protects
the source of God's power on Earth.

27:46.748 --> 27:48.625
I can't do this by myself.

27:49.168 --> 27:52.217
I'm in enough trouble as it is.
That's my embassy.

27:52.296 --> 27:53.388
Please.

27:53.463 --> 27:55.932
- Even if we could get out of this...
- Okay.

28:33.045 --> 28:36.424
No, no, no. You're not gonna make it.
You're not gonna make it!

28:44.056 --> 28:45.399
Well, that was...

28:54.274 --> 28:56.026
We need to get out of sight.

29:10.666 --> 29:12.964
Christ, give me strength.

29:25.514 --> 29:29.519
You are a ghost.

29:30.852 --> 29:33.150
Christ, give me strength.

30:10.434 --> 30:13.062
Stealing in a house of God!

30:26.408 --> 30:28.410
You are an angel.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.915
Christ, give me strength.

30:58.398 --> 31:00.571
You have powerful friends.

31:01.276 --> 31:04.450
Bishop Aringarosa has been kind to me.

31:05.030 --> 31:09.035
I could not miss this chance
to pray inside the Saint-Sulpice.

31:09.910 --> 31:12.379
A pity you couldn't wait for morning.

31:12.454 --> 31:14.456
The light is not ideal.

31:15.415 --> 31:19.545
Tell me, Sister, please, of the Rose Line.

31:19.961 --> 31:25.138
A rose line is any line that goes from
the North to South Poles.

31:25.258 --> 31:30.139
Set into the streets of Paris,
135 brass markers

31:30.222 --> 31:33.101
mark the world's first prime meridian

31:33.183 --> 31:35.606
which passed through this very church.

31:35.685 --> 31:37.528
It hides beneath the Rose.

31:37.687 --> 31:38.904
I'm sorry?

31:40.315 --> 31:41.567
Sister.

31:44.277 --> 31:47.577
I do not want to keep you.
I will show myself out.

31:50.784 --> 31:51.910
I insist.

31:56.164 --> 31:59.088
May the peace of the Lord be with you.

32:00.710 --> 32:02.132
And with you.

32:15.350 --> 32:20.857
They found Neveu's car
abandoned at the train station.

32:21.606 --> 32:26.533
And two tickets to Brussels paid for
with Langdon's credit card.

32:26.736 --> 32:28.204
A decoy, I'm sure.

32:28.405 --> 32:30.874
All the same, send an officer to the station.

32:31.074 --> 32:33.702
Question all the taxi drivers.
I'll put this on the wire.

32:33.952 --> 32:36.751
Interpol? We're not sure he's guilty.

32:37.080 --> 32:40.880
I know he's guilty. Beyond a doubt.

32:41.042 --> 32:44.012
Robert Langdon is guilty.

32:52.971 --> 32:54.223
This is the Bois de Boulogne?

32:54.306 --> 32:57.150
We should be safe in this park
for a few minutes.

33:49.110 --> 33:50.407
Stay here.

33:52.113 --> 33:53.456
Police.

33:54.950 --> 33:56.293
What do you want?

34:01.831 --> 34:03.925
Fifty euros for all your stuff.

34:06.127 --> 34:08.300
Go and get something to eat.

34:28.275 --> 34:30.152
Did it ever occur to you
that could be dangerous?

34:30.235 --> 34:33.455
No. And now we have a place to think.

34:34.197 --> 34:35.915
Any ideas, Professor?

34:37.117 --> 34:40.667
You could've just handed me
a piece of a UFO from Area 51.

34:42.789 --> 34:44.837
"What's the next step?"

34:45.375 --> 34:47.002
With him, it's always,

34:47.085 --> 34:50.179
"Sophie, what's the next step?"

34:50.839 --> 34:52.431
Puzzles.

34:52.507 --> 34:53.850
Codes.

34:54.759 --> 34:55.931
A treasure hunt.

35:00.515 --> 35:01.767
To find his killer.

35:06.021 --> 35:09.446
Maybe there is something
about this Priory of Sion.

35:09.649 --> 35:10.650
I hope not.

35:10.900 --> 35:15.701
Any Priory story ends in bloodshed.
They were butchered by the Church.

35:16.072 --> 35:19.246
It all started over a thousand years ago
when a French king

35:19.326 --> 35:21.749
conquered the holy city of Jerusalem.

35:22.078 --> 35:25.503
This crusade, one of the most
massive and sweeping in history,

35:25.582 --> 35:29.212
was actually orchestrated
by a secret brotherhood,

35:29.294 --> 35:30.466
the Priory of Sion

35:30.545 --> 35:34.846
and their military arm, the Knights Templar.

35:35.383 --> 35:38.432
But the Templars were created
to protect the Holy Land.

35:38.637 --> 35:42.642
That was a cover to hide their true goal,
according to this myth.

35:43.099 --> 35:46.194
Supposedly the invasion
was to find an artifact

35:46.269 --> 35:48.192
lost since the time of Christ.

35:48.271 --> 35:52.401
An artifact, it was said,
the Church would kill to possess.

35:52.901 --> 35:55.495
Did they find it, this buried treasure?

35:56.696 --> 35:57.948
Put it this way.

35:58.073 --> 36:00.496
One day the Templars
simply stopped searching.

36:01.242 --> 36:04.416
They quit the Holy Land
and traveled directly to Rome.

36:04.913 --> 36:06.915
Whether they blackmailed the papacy

36:06.998 --> 36:09.342
or the Church bought their silence,
no one knows.

36:09.417 --> 36:13.593
But it is a fact the papacy
declared these Priory knights,

36:13.672 --> 36:17.302
these Knights Templar, of limitless power.

36:18.510 --> 36:21.764
By the 1300s,
the Templars had grown too powerful.

36:21.846 --> 36:23.268
Too threatening.

36:23.515 --> 36:25.688
So the Vatican issued secret orders

36:26.101 --> 36:28.900
to be opened simultaneously
all across Europe.

36:29.771 --> 36:33.526
The Pope had declared
the Knights Templar Satan worshipers

36:33.608 --> 36:37.829
and said God had charged him
with cleansing the Earth of these heretics.

36:38.321 --> 36:40.665
The plan went off like clockwork.

36:41.366 --> 36:43.994
The Templars were all but exterminated.

36:44.077 --> 36:48.298
The date was October 13, 1307. A Friday.

36:48.540 --> 36:50.258
Friday the 13th.

36:51.126 --> 36:54.130
The Pope sent troops
to claim the Priory's treasure,

36:54.212 --> 36:55.805
but they found nothing.

36:55.964 --> 36:59.434
The few surviving Knights of the Priory
had vanished,

36:59.509 --> 37:02.558
and the search for
their sacred artifact began again.

37:02.637 --> 37:06.016
What artifact?
I've never heard about any of this.

37:06.975 --> 37:08.477
Yes, you have.

37:08.852 --> 37:10.604
Almost everyone on Earth has.

37:11.604 --> 37:14.232
You just know it as the Holy Grail.

37:20.363 --> 37:23.833
Please, Saunière thought he knew
the location of the Holy Grail?

37:24.909 --> 37:26.832
Maybe more than that.

37:26.995 --> 37:30.875
This cross and the flower,
this could be very old. But look.

37:30.957 --> 37:35.508
This metal here underneath is much newer,
and there's a modern ID stamp.

37:36.337 --> 37:37.759
"Haxo 24."

37:40.383 --> 37:43.762
And these dots.
These dots are read by a laser.

37:43.970 --> 37:47.691
This is more than a pendant.
This is a key your grandfather left you.

37:47.849 --> 37:50.022
He left us, Professor.

37:51.811 --> 37:56.157
And vingt-quatre Haxo, it's not an ID stamp.

37:56.649 --> 37:58.526
It's a street address.

38:03.448 --> 38:05.041
This is Jacques Saunière.

38:05.408 --> 38:08.252
Please leave a message after the tone.

38:08.953 --> 38:11.331
Please, Monsieur Saunière, pick up the phone.

38:11.581 --> 38:13.083
This is Sandrine Bieil.

38:13.333 --> 38:15.586
I have called the list.

38:16.002 --> 38:17.925
I fear the other guardians are dead.

38:18.505 --> 38:20.428
The lie has been told.

38:20.757 --> 38:22.680
The floor panel has been broken.

38:23.343 --> 38:26.768
Please, monsieur, pick up the phone.
I beg you.

38:26.846 --> 38:28.564
Job 38, verse 11.

38:30.350 --> 38:32.273
Do you know it, Sister?

38:34.062 --> 38:35.814
Job 38:11.

38:37.482 --> 38:41.737
"Hitherto shalt thou come but no further."

38:42.487 --> 38:43.909
"But no further."

38:48.034 --> 38:49.911
Do you mock me?

38:52.789 --> 38:54.917
Where is the keystone?

38:55.917 --> 38:57.669
I do not know.

38:58.711 --> 38:59.837
No.

39:02.131 --> 39:04.509
You are a sister of the Church

39:06.845 --> 39:10.349
and yet you serve them, the Priory.

39:10.431 --> 39:14.356
Jesus had but one true message, that...

39:27.365 --> 39:30.084
Come, you saints of God.

39:30.994 --> 39:33.622
Hasten, angels of the Lord.

39:34.372 --> 39:37.125
To receive her soul.

39:37.584 --> 39:42.135
And bring her to the sight of the Almighty.

40:00.648 --> 40:02.321
Welcome, Bishop.

40:03.192 --> 40:05.240
This council is convened.

40:13.828 --> 40:17.253
Our words shall never pass these walls.

40:20.335 --> 40:22.008
What business, say you?

40:23.963 --> 40:26.091
As you know, my request for funds...

40:26.174 --> 40:30.020
Yes, 20 million euro
in untraceable bearer bonds.

40:30.678 --> 40:33.978
A tad more than petty cash.
Wouldn't you say, Bishop?

40:35.767 --> 40:40.398
I only offer a route to the renewal
of faith for all men.

40:40.521 --> 40:41.943
How humble.

40:42.023 --> 40:44.822
Our savior, Bishop Aringarosa.

40:44.901 --> 40:46.448
How dare you presume to...

40:46.527 --> 40:48.245
I do not presume, I act!

40:48.738 --> 40:52.618
The Vatican's unwillingness to support us
is both impious and cowardly.

40:52.909 --> 40:57.039
Blood is being spilled because
true Christian values lie in ruins. No more!

40:57.705 --> 41:00.925
This council has forgotten its very purpose.

41:03.628 --> 41:08.475
Tonight, the Grail will be destroyed.

41:08.549 --> 41:12.099
The Priory's few remaining members
will be silenced.

41:20.311 --> 41:24.566
I was contacted by a man
who calls himself only "the Teacher."

41:27.110 --> 41:29.704
Two prostitutes identified
Langdon and Neveu...

41:29.862 --> 41:32.081
...getting into a taxi
in the Bois de Boulogne.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.923
Because of your expertise?

41:45.086 --> 41:46.679
- I'm sorry?
- About the Priory.

41:46.754 --> 41:49.223
Do you think that's why
Saunière sought you out?

41:49.799 --> 41:53.019
I can think of dozens of scholars
who know a lot more about it.

41:53.094 --> 41:57.190
Actually, I didn't think
he liked me very much.

41:57.849 --> 42:01.399
Once made a joke at my expense.
Got a big laugh out of it.

42:01.477 --> 42:02.820
What was it?

42:15.992 --> 42:17.790
How may I help you?

42:23.666 --> 42:25.964
The door to the right, please.

42:44.437 --> 42:47.111
Good evening. I am André Vernet,
the night manager.

42:48.608 --> 42:51.862
I take it this is your first visit
to our establishment?

42:52.653 --> 42:53.779
Yes.

42:54.489 --> 42:55.832
Understood.

42:56.657 --> 42:58.079
Keys are often passed on

42:58.159 --> 43:01.880
and first-time users
are sometimes uncertain of protocol.

43:03.664 --> 43:06.508
Keys are essentially numbered Swiss accounts.

43:08.086 --> 43:10.635
Often willed through generations.

43:13.549 --> 43:16.018
Is it yours, mademoiselle?

43:18.137 --> 43:21.141
The shortest safety-deposit-box lease
is 50 years.

43:22.141 --> 43:24.189
And what's your longest account?

43:24.393 --> 43:25.986
Quite a bit longer.

43:26.437 --> 43:29.065
Technologies change, keys are updated.

43:34.487 --> 43:36.239
Once the computer confirms your key,

43:36.322 --> 43:39.371
enter your account number
and your box is retrieved.

43:40.076 --> 43:42.545
The room is yours, as long as you like.

43:47.542 --> 43:50.762
What if I lost track of my account number?

43:51.337 --> 43:52.805
How might I recover it?

43:55.049 --> 43:57.768
I'm afraid each key is paired
with a 10-digit number

43:57.844 --> 43:59.972
known only to the account bearer.

44:00.054 --> 44:02.148
I hope you manage to remember it.

44:02.765 --> 44:05.393
A single wrong entry disables the system.

44:12.358 --> 44:13.575
- Ten.
- Ten.

44:13.651 --> 44:16.200
Your grandfather's Fibonacci sequence.

44:19.282 --> 44:21.660
Scrambled, unscrambled?

44:22.577 --> 44:23.920
Unscrambled.

44:24.579 --> 44:26.252
It's your key.

44:30.960 --> 44:34.681
Funny, I don't even like history.

44:37.800 --> 44:42.306
I've never seen much good
come from looking to the past.

44:49.770 --> 44:51.272
Moment of truth.

45:35.942 --> 45:38.491
My God. I don't believe this.

45:38.903 --> 45:40.075
A rose.

45:44.909 --> 45:46.752
The rose was a symbol for the Holy Grail.

45:49.622 --> 45:51.590
Forgive the intrusion.

45:51.666 --> 45:54.795
I'm afraid the police arrived
more quickly than anticipated.

45:55.920 --> 45:57.672
You must follow me, please.

45:57.880 --> 45:59.257
For your own safety.

45:59.632 --> 46:01.350
You knew they were coming?

46:01.425 --> 46:04.269
My guard alerted me to your status
when you arrived.

46:04.345 --> 46:07.349
Yours is one of our oldest
and highest-level accounts.

46:07.431 --> 46:09.684
It includes a safe-passage clause.

46:09.850 --> 46:11.022
Safe passage?

46:11.936 --> 46:15.190
If you would step inside, please.
Time is of the essence.

46:18.317 --> 46:19.569
In there?

46:34.750 --> 46:36.548
Hey, is there a problem?

46:36.794 --> 46:39.422
Good evening, sir. Police.

46:39.880 --> 46:43.976
I just drive from here to Zurich.
Not French, English?

46:44.218 --> 46:45.344
- English?
- Yes.

46:46.721 --> 46:49.395
We are looking for two criminals.

46:50.683 --> 46:53.562
You came to the right place.
They're all criminals here.

46:55.354 --> 46:57.698
Would you mind opening the hold?

46:58.232 --> 47:01.862
Please. You think they trust us,
the wages I get paid?

47:01.944 --> 47:03.946
You don't have keys to your own truck?

47:04.030 --> 47:06.749
It's armored.
Keys get sent to the destination.

47:06.907 --> 47:09.001
You mind? I'm on a schedule here.

47:12.538 --> 47:16.918
And do all the drivers wear a Rolex?

47:17.418 --> 47:18.510
What?

47:20.921 --> 47:22.594
This piece of shit.

47:22.673 --> 47:24.550
Forty euros in Barbés.

47:24.633 --> 47:25.759
Yours for 35.

47:26.427 --> 47:27.519
No, no, no.

47:27.595 --> 47:29.438
- Thirty.
- No. It's okay, it's okay.

47:29.555 --> 47:32.308
- Come on, 30?
- I said, no!

47:32.892 --> 47:34.018
Move along!

47:47.448 --> 47:48.665
Now we wait.

47:48.741 --> 47:51.460
The Teacher will call and tell me
where to deliver the money.

47:51.535 --> 47:54.880
You have put tremendous faith
in this Teacher of yours.

47:54.955 --> 47:59.381
Yes, I have.
And I have given him an angel to do his will.

47:59.877 --> 48:03.256
For surely there is no better soldier
for God than my Silas.

48:04.340 --> 48:08.061
I firmly resolve, with the help of
thy grace, to confess my sins...

48:08.260 --> 48:13.061
...to do penance and to amend my life.

48:13.349 --> 48:14.350
Amen.

48:29.698 --> 48:31.325
The Holy Grail.

48:32.118 --> 48:37.090
A magic cup.
The source of God's power on earth.

48:37.164 --> 48:38.461
It's nonsense.

48:39.417 --> 48:41.340
You don't believe in God.

48:42.211 --> 48:43.337
No.

48:44.296 --> 48:45.798
Just people.

48:47.091 --> 48:49.685
Sometimes that they can be kind.

48:51.053 --> 48:53.647
Are you a God-fearing man, Professor?

48:55.182 --> 48:57.025
I was raised a Catholic.

48:57.685 --> 48:59.528
Well, that's not really an answer.

49:02.148 --> 49:03.866
Professor, are you okay?

49:04.900 --> 49:06.527
Go ahead, open it.

49:07.361 --> 49:08.408
Go on.

49:15.536 --> 49:16.879
A cryptex.

49:18.164 --> 49:20.667
They are used to keep secrets.

49:21.459 --> 49:23.587
It's da Vinci's design.

49:24.336 --> 49:27.761
You write the information on a papyrus scroll

49:27.840 --> 49:32.937
which is then rolled around
a thin glass vial of vinegar.

49:33.012 --> 49:36.312
If you force it open, the vial breaks,

49:36.390 --> 49:39.064
vinegar dissolves papyrus,

49:40.978 --> 49:43.572
and your secret is lost forever.

49:43.939 --> 49:46.112
The only way to access the information

49:46.192 --> 49:51.824
is to spell out the password
with these five dials, each with 26 letters.

49:52.865 --> 49:56.745
That's 12 million possibilities.

49:57.495 --> 50:00.999
I've never met a girl
who knew that much about a cryptex.

50:02.333 --> 50:04.586
Saunière made one for me once.

50:12.551 --> 50:15.771
My grandfather gave me a wagon.

50:18.307 --> 50:20.605
This clearly is not the Holy Grail.

50:24.480 --> 50:25.652
Come on.

50:25.940 --> 50:27.408
Please, you're not all right.

50:30.778 --> 50:32.246
May I try something?

50:32.905 --> 50:34.498
I don't know why it works.

50:35.407 --> 50:38.456
My mother used to do it
when I was scared, I think.

50:39.328 --> 50:40.625
You think?

50:41.413 --> 50:42.505
Yes.

50:54.385 --> 50:56.262
Feeling better, Sophie?

51:08.190 --> 51:12.661
My parents died in a car crash
with my brother.

51:13.821 --> 51:15.164
I was four.

51:17.157 --> 51:18.534
I'm sorry.

51:19.910 --> 51:21.833
It was many years ago.

51:37.511 --> 51:38.763
Better?

51:41.515 --> 51:42.516
Yeah.

51:43.309 --> 51:44.435
Okay.

52:10.544 --> 52:13.138
Twenty years waiting
for someone to come for that box,

52:13.213 --> 52:15.762
and now it's you two murderers.
Bring it to me.

52:16.717 --> 52:18.390
I don't know what you're talking about.

52:19.595 --> 52:21.393
All right! Okay!

52:22.222 --> 52:23.223
Right now!

52:33.692 --> 52:34.693
Step back!

52:38.656 --> 52:41.079
No one will lose sleep
over a couple on a killing spree.

52:44.244 --> 52:45.291
Turn around.

52:46.580 --> 52:48.002
Turn around!

52:48.582 --> 52:50.255
You too, mademoiselle.

53:13.023 --> 53:14.195
Sophie!

53:14.983 --> 53:16.360
Get in the truck!

53:16.860 --> 53:18.453
I'll drive! Hurry!

53:47.599 --> 53:51.820
What happened between you
and your grandfather, exactly?

53:53.439 --> 53:57.194
I've jammed my shoulder,
I've been shot at, I'm bleeding.

53:57.317 --> 53:58.910
I need to know.

53:59.153 --> 54:02.908
You say he raised you,
but you two don't talk anymore.

54:02.990 --> 54:04.788
You call him by his last name.

54:05.367 --> 54:07.586
You say you hate history.

54:07.661 --> 54:10.084
Nobody hates history.
They hate their own histories.

54:10.164 --> 54:12.166
So now you're a psychologist too?

54:12.624 --> 54:17.221
What if Saunière had started
to groom you for the Priory?

54:17.296 --> 54:18.764
What do you mean, groom me?

54:18.839 --> 54:22.093
Your grandfather gave you puzzles
and cryptex as a child.

54:22.176 --> 54:26.181
So you are saying all this is real?
The Priory, the Holy Grail?

54:26.388 --> 54:29.642
We've been dragged into a world
of people who think this stuff is real.

54:29.725 --> 54:31.853
- Real enough to kill for.
- Who?

54:38.066 --> 54:40.615
I'm out of my field here.

54:43.030 --> 54:48.332
I do know a Grail historian,
absolutely obsessed with Priory myth.

54:48.994 --> 54:51.292
An Englishman, lives here in France.

54:51.371 --> 54:52.998
Do you trust this man?

54:54.124 --> 54:55.671
I hope you can.

55:05.260 --> 55:08.104
It seems you're not a driver at all.

55:09.932 --> 55:14.733
Apparently, you lost your tongue
along with your truck.

55:15.395 --> 55:18.069
You think you're in pain now, André Vernet?

55:18.482 --> 55:22.487
My cause is worth your life. Understand?

55:26.824 --> 55:28.417
What do you want?

55:28.742 --> 55:33.999
Your truck carries a homing device.
Activate it.

55:41.630 --> 55:44.349
Please wait. I'll see if he's available.

55:44.466 --> 55:46.343
It's on the wrong side.

55:46.426 --> 55:49.054
Leigh likes all things to be English,
including his cars.

55:49.137 --> 55:52.266
Robert! Do I owe you money?

55:53.016 --> 55:56.020
Leigh, my friend,

55:56.103 --> 55:59.198
care to open up for an old colleague?

55:59.273 --> 56:00.991
- Of course.
- Thank you.

56:01.817 --> 56:04.240
But first, a test of honor.

56:04.611 --> 56:06.329
Three questions.

56:09.616 --> 56:10.959
Fire away.

56:11.034 --> 56:12.456
Your first.

56:12.661 --> 56:15.335
Shall I serve coffee or tea?

56:16.206 --> 56:17.708
Tea, of course.

56:17.791 --> 56:18.963
Excellent.

56:19.042 --> 56:21.340
Second. Milk or lemon?

56:22.379 --> 56:23.426
Milk?

56:24.798 --> 56:27.221
That would depend on the tea.

56:27.301 --> 56:28.393
Correct.

56:29.303 --> 56:33.479
And now the third
and most grave of inquiries.

56:33.599 --> 56:39.106
In which year did a Harvard sculler
out-row an Oxford man at Henley?

56:46.528 --> 56:50.283
Surely such a travesty has never occurred.

56:50.908 --> 56:52.785
Your heart is true.

56:53.660 --> 56:55.003
You may pass.

56:56.830 --> 56:59.174
Welcome to Château Villette.

57:02.085 --> 57:04.713
The truck's signal is coming online.

57:04.922 --> 57:06.344
It's about time.

57:10.093 --> 57:11.720
Locked on and tracking, sir.

57:14.556 --> 57:17.981
Very good. Tell Collet not to move in
until I get there.

57:19.561 --> 57:23.031
Attention! All of Collet's units
to Château Villette.

57:23.941 --> 57:27.286
The suspects Neveu and Langdon
are likely at that location.

57:43.585 --> 57:44.928
Aringarosa.

57:55.889 --> 57:58.893
I still don't know why he put you into this

57:59.601 --> 58:01.524
and I'm sorry.

58:06.608 --> 58:10.454
But I'm also very glad.

58:28.714 --> 58:31.388
You are requested to make yourself at home.

58:39.683 --> 58:40.855
Robert!

58:41.935 --> 58:44.529
And you travel with a maiden, it seems.

58:44.855 --> 58:48.075
Sir Leigh Teabing,
may I present Miss Sophie Neveu.

58:48.150 --> 58:50.278
Sophie, Sir Leigh Teabing.

58:50.652 --> 58:54.498
It's an honor to welcome you...

58:55.115 --> 58:57.209
...even though it's late.

58:57.284 --> 59:01.130
Thank you for having us.
I realize it's quite late.

59:02.414 --> 59:05.418
So late, mademoiselle, it's almost early.

59:08.045 --> 59:09.672
What a lovely smile you have.

59:12.007 --> 59:13.008
Earl Grey?

59:13.717 --> 59:14.809
Lemon.

59:15.510 --> 59:16.636
Correct.

59:37.532 --> 59:39.785
Château Villette. Yes.

59:41.495 --> 59:43.589
A dramatic late-night arrival.

59:43.914 --> 59:46.542
What can an old cripple do for you, Robert?

59:47.459 --> 59:51.339
We wanna talk about the Priory of Sion.

59:51.505 --> 59:52.722
The keepers?

59:53.632 --> 59:54.884
The secret war?

59:54.966 --> 59:56.968
Sorry for all the mystery.

59:57.886 --> 01:00:00.981
Leigh, I'm into something here
that I cannot understand.

01:00:01.389 --> 01:00:02.515
You?

01:00:03.225 --> 01:00:06.604
- Really?
- Not without your help.

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:10.240
Playing to my vanity, Robert.
You should be ashamed.

01:00:10.315 --> 01:00:11.532
Not if it works.

01:00:14.111 --> 01:00:16.284
There are always four.

01:00:17.072 --> 01:00:20.201
The Grand Master and the three sénéchaux

01:00:20.408 --> 01:00:23.833
make up the primary guardians of the Grail.

01:00:25.747 --> 01:00:27.715
Thank you, Remy. That'll be all for now.

01:00:34.297 --> 01:00:37.767
The Priory's members
span our very globe itself.

01:00:37.843 --> 01:00:42.394
Philippe de Chérisey
exposed that as a hoax in 1967.

01:00:42.472 --> 01:00:44.600
And that is what they want you to believe.

01:00:45.350 --> 01:00:48.229
The Priory is charged with a single task.

01:00:48.353 --> 01:00:51.823
To protect the greatest secret
in modern history.

01:00:51.898 --> 01:00:54.447
The source of God's power on Earth.

01:00:54.526 --> 01:00:56.278
No, that's a common misunderstanding.

01:00:56.403 --> 01:01:01.034
The Priory protects the source
of the Church's power on Earth.

01:01:02.033 --> 01:01:03.330
The Holy Grail.

01:01:03.869 --> 01:01:05.621
I don't understand.

01:01:05.704 --> 01:01:09.834
What power? Some magic dishes?

01:01:10.584 --> 01:01:14.680
Robert. Has he been telling you
that the Holy Grail is a cup?

01:01:29.227 --> 01:01:33.073
The Good Book did not arrive
by facsimile from heaven.

01:01:33.773 --> 01:01:38.404
The Bible as we know it
was finally presided over by one man.

01:01:38.486 --> 01:01:40.238
The pagan emperor Constantine.

01:01:40.655 --> 01:01:42.783
I thought Constantine was a Christian.

01:01:42.991 --> 01:01:46.040
Hardly, no. He was a lifelong pagan

01:01:46.119 --> 01:01:48.747
who was baptized on his deathbed.

01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:51.629
Constantine was Rome's supreme holy man.

01:01:52.626 --> 01:01:54.253
From time immemorial,

01:01:54.336 --> 01:01:58.933
his people had worshiped a balance
between nature's male deities

01:01:59.007 --> 01:02:02.511
and the goddess or sacred feminine.

01:02:03.303 --> 01:02:06.853
But a growing religious turmoil
was gripping Rome.

01:02:07.515 --> 01:02:09.517
Three centuries earlier,

01:02:09.601 --> 01:02:12.400
a young Jew named Jesus had come along,

01:02:12.479 --> 01:02:14.982
preaching love and a single God.

01:02:15.273 --> 01:02:18.072
Centuries after his crucifixion,

01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:21.204
Christ's followers had grown exponentially

01:02:21.279 --> 01:02:24.374
and had started a religious war
against the pagans.

01:02:29.496 --> 01:02:32.875
Or did the pagans commence war
against the Christians?

01:02:33.541 --> 01:02:36.761
Leigh, we can't be sure who began
the atrocities in that period.

01:02:36.836 --> 01:02:40.056
But we can at least agree
that the conflict grew to such proportions

01:02:40.131 --> 01:02:41.804
that it threatened to tear Rome in two.

01:02:42.801 --> 01:02:46.271
So Constantine may have been
a lifelong pagan,

01:02:46.346 --> 01:02:48.064
but he was also a pragmatist.

01:02:48.139 --> 01:02:50.642
And in 325 Anno Domini,

01:02:50.725 --> 01:02:55.947
he decided to unify Rome
under a single religion, Christianity.

01:02:56.022 --> 01:02:59.868
Christianity was on the rise.
He didn't want his empire torn apart.

01:03:00.402 --> 01:03:03.497
And to strengthen
this new Christian tradition,

01:03:03.571 --> 01:03:06.245
Constantine held
a famous ecumenical gathering

01:03:06.324 --> 01:03:08.873
known as the Council of Nicaea.

01:03:09.369 --> 01:03:10.962
And at this council,

01:03:11.037 --> 01:03:15.793
the many sects of Christianity
debated and voted on, well,

01:03:15.875 --> 01:03:20.130
everything, from the acceptance
and rejection of specific gospels

01:03:20.213 --> 01:03:21.760
to the date for Easter

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:24.810
to the administering of the sacraments,
and of course,

01:03:24.884 --> 01:03:27.057
the immortality of Jesus.

01:03:27.762 --> 01:03:29.014
I don't follow.

01:03:29.431 --> 01:03:32.310
Well, ma chère, until that moment in history,

01:03:32.392 --> 01:03:37.239
Jesus was viewed by many
of his followers as a mighty prophet,

01:03:37.314 --> 01:03:41.160
as a great and powerful man,
but a man nevertheless.

01:03:41.568 --> 01:03:43.411
A mortal man.

01:03:43.611 --> 01:03:44.908
Not the Son of God?

01:03:44.988 --> 01:03:47.616
Not even his nephew twice removed.

01:03:47.699 --> 01:03:51.545
Constantine did not create Jesus' divinity.

01:03:51.619 --> 01:03:55.590
He simply sanctioned
an already widely held idea.

01:03:55.665 --> 01:03:57.508
- Semantics.
- No, it's not semantics.

01:03:57.584 --> 01:04:00.758
You're interpreting facts
to support your own conclusions.

01:04:00.837 --> 01:04:05.593
Fact. For many Christians, Jesus was
mortal one day and divine the next.

01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:07.677
For some Christians,
his divinity was enhanced.

01:04:07.761 --> 01:04:10.310
Absurd. There was even a formal
announcement of his promotion.

01:04:10.388 --> 01:04:12.356
They couldn't even agree on the Nicene Creed!

01:04:12.432 --> 01:04:15.857
Excuse me. "Who is God, who is man?"

01:04:20.565 --> 01:04:23.444
How many have been murdered
over this question?

01:04:24.277 --> 01:04:27.326
As long as there has been a one true God,

01:04:27.405 --> 01:04:29.578
there has been killing in his name.

01:04:38.124 --> 01:04:40.752
Now let me show you the Grail.

01:04:43.296 --> 01:04:46.470
I trust you recognize The Last Supper,

01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:50.554
the great fresco by Leonardo da Vinci.

01:04:52.931 --> 01:04:55.684
Now, my dear, if you would close your eyes.

01:04:55.767 --> 01:04:57.610
Leigh, save us the parlor tricks.

01:04:58.186 --> 01:05:00.530
You asked for my help, I recall.

01:05:00.605 --> 01:05:03.233
Allow an old man his indulgences.

01:05:07.654 --> 01:05:11.079
Now, mademoiselle, where is Jesus sitting?

01:05:11.658 --> 01:05:13.501
- In the middle.
- Good.

01:05:13.576 --> 01:05:16.420
He and his disciples are breaking bread.

01:05:16.621 --> 01:05:19.295
And what drink?

01:05:19.374 --> 01:05:21.376
Wine. They drank wine.

01:05:21.459 --> 01:05:23.882
Splendid. And one final question.

01:05:23.962 --> 01:05:26.636
How many wineglasses are there on the table?

01:05:28.341 --> 01:05:30.389
One? The Holy Grail?

01:05:30.468 --> 01:05:31.469
Open your eyes.

01:05:34.431 --> 01:05:36.058
No single cup.

01:05:36.641 --> 01:05:37.858
No chalice.

01:05:38.059 --> 01:05:40.812
Well, that's a bit strange, isn't it?

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:43.990
Considering both the Bible
and standard Grail legend

01:05:44.065 --> 01:05:48.366
celebrate this moment
as the definitive arrival of the Holy Grail.

01:05:51.364 --> 01:05:54.038
Now, Robert, you could be of help to us.

01:05:54.117 --> 01:05:58.042
If you'd be so kind as to show us
the symbols for man and woman, please.

01:05:58.204 --> 01:06:01.925
No balloon animals. I can make a great duck.

01:06:04.961 --> 01:06:09.216
This is the original icon for male.
It's a rudimentary phallus.

01:06:09.299 --> 01:06:11.552
- Quite to the point.
- Yes, indeed.

01:06:11.634 --> 01:06:13.728
This is known as the blade.

01:06:13.887 --> 01:06:15.889
It represents aggression and manhood.

01:06:15.972 --> 01:06:18.725
It's a symbol still used today
in modern military uniforms.

01:06:18.850 --> 01:06:23.105
Yes, the more penises you have,
the higher your rank. Boys will be boys.

01:06:23.188 --> 01:06:27.614
Now, as you would imagine,
the female symbol is its exact opposite.

01:06:27.692 --> 01:06:28.989
This is called the chalice.

01:06:29.068 --> 01:06:34.245
And the chalice resembles
a cup or vessel or, more importantly,

01:06:34.324 --> 01:06:36.497
the shape of a woman's womb.

01:06:37.702 --> 01:06:40.797
No, the Grail has never been a cup.

01:06:40.872 --> 01:06:45.844
It is quite literally
this ancient symbol of womanhood.

01:06:46.961 --> 01:06:52.218
And in this case, a woman who
carried a secret so powerful

01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:56.601
that if revealed, it would devastate
the very foundations of Christianity.

01:06:56.804 --> 01:06:58.147
Wait, please.

01:06:58.223 --> 01:07:02.774
You're saying the Holy Grail is a person?
A woman?

01:07:03.645 --> 01:07:07.616
And it turns out,
she makes an appearance right there.

01:07:08.107 --> 01:07:09.780
But they are all men.

01:07:10.068 --> 01:07:11.320
Are they?

01:07:11.402 --> 01:07:13.905
What about that figure
on the right hand of our Lord,

01:07:13.988 --> 01:07:16.707
seated in the place of honor?

01:07:17.534 --> 01:07:19.377
Flowing red hair.

01:07:20.495 --> 01:07:22.793
Folded feminine hands.

01:07:23.957 --> 01:07:26.380
Hint of a bosom. No?

01:07:31.881 --> 01:07:35.260
It's called scotoma.
The mind sees what it chooses to see.

01:07:35.593 --> 01:07:36.970
Who is she?

01:07:38.263 --> 01:07:40.140
My dear, that's Mary Magdalene.

01:07:40.515 --> 01:07:41.562
The prostitute?

01:07:42.517 --> 01:07:43.985
She was no such thing.

01:07:44.394 --> 01:07:48.991
Smeared by the Church in 591 Anno Domini,
poor dear.

01:07:51.442 --> 01:07:54.241
Mary Magdalene was Jesus' wife.

01:08:01.286 --> 01:08:03.380
This is an old wives' tale.

01:08:03.454 --> 01:08:05.047
The original one, in fact.

01:08:05.123 --> 01:08:07.217
There's virtually no empirical proof.

01:08:07.375 --> 01:08:10.720
He knows as well as I do
there's much evidence to support it.

01:08:10.795 --> 01:08:12.422
Theories. There are theories.

01:08:12.505 --> 01:08:15.679
Notice how Jesus and Mary are clothed.

01:08:17.218 --> 01:08:19.390
Mirror images of each other.

01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:22.064
The mind sees what it chooses to see.

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:24.734
And venturing into the even more bizarre,

01:08:24.809 --> 01:08:28.689
notice how Jesus and Mary
appear to be joined at the hip

01:08:28.770 --> 01:08:30.398
and are leaning away from each other

01:08:30.481 --> 01:08:35.032
as if to create a shape
in the negative space between them.

01:08:36.029 --> 01:08:39.374
Leonardo gives us the chalice.

01:08:41.908 --> 01:08:44.457
Yes. And Robert, notice what happens

01:08:44.537 --> 01:08:47.962
when these two figures change position.

01:08:48.707 --> 01:08:51.211
Just because da Vinci painted it
doesn't make it true.

01:08:52.211 --> 01:08:54.087
No. But history,

01:08:54.505 --> 01:08:56.303
she does make it true.

01:08:56.506 --> 01:08:59.727
Now, listen to this.
It's from the Gospel according to Philip.

01:08:59.926 --> 01:09:00.928
Philip?

01:09:01.011 --> 01:09:04.107
Yes, it was rejected at the Council of Nicaea

01:09:04.182 --> 01:09:08.983
along with any other gospels that made
Jesus appear human and not divine.

01:09:09.062 --> 01:09:13.988
"And the companion of the Savior
is Mary Magdalene.

01:09:14.359 --> 01:09:18.205
"Christ loved her more than all the disciples

01:09:18.279 --> 01:09:19.997
"and used to kiss her on the..."

01:09:20.073 --> 01:09:22.326
But this says nothing of marriage.

01:09:22.408 --> 01:09:26.332
Well, actually... Robert.

01:09:26.953 --> 01:09:31.585
Actually, in those days, the word
"companion" literally meant "spouse."

01:09:31.792 --> 01:09:36.264
And this is from the Gospel
of Mary Magdalene herself.

01:09:36.421 --> 01:09:39.095
- She wrote a gospel?
- She may have.

01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:42.270
- Robert, will you fight fair?
- She may have.

01:09:42.428 --> 01:09:46.433
"And Peter said, 'Did he prefer her to us?'

01:09:47.392 --> 01:09:48.769
"And Levi answered,

01:09:48.850 --> 01:09:52.947
"'Peter, I see you contending
against a woman like an adversary.

01:09:53.147 --> 01:09:57.618
"If the Savior made her worthy,
who are you, indeed, to reject her?"'

01:09:57.819 --> 01:10:02.416
Yes. And then, my dear, Jesus
goes on to tell Mary Magdalene

01:10:02.490 --> 01:10:06.336
that it's up to her to continue his Church.

01:10:07.453 --> 01:10:10.127
Mary Magdalene, not Peter.

01:10:10.456 --> 01:10:14.302
The Church was supposed
to be carried on by a woman.

01:10:15.211 --> 01:10:19.933
Few realize that Mary was descended
from kings, just as her husband was.

01:10:20.508 --> 01:10:25.730
Now, my dear,
the word in French for Holy Grail.

01:10:27.181 --> 01:10:30.435
From the Middle English "Sangreal,"

01:10:30.518 --> 01:10:33.237
of the original Arthurian legend.

01:10:33.312 --> 01:10:38.443
Now, as two words.
Can you translate for our friend?

01:10:41.112 --> 01:10:43.240
It means "royal blood."

01:10:44.323 --> 01:10:48.544
When the legend speaks of
the chalice that held the blood of Christ,

01:10:48.953 --> 01:10:54.255
it speaks in fact of the female womb
that carried Jesus' royal bloodline.

01:10:55.418 --> 01:10:58.171
But how could Christ
have a bloodline unless...

01:10:58.254 --> 01:11:01.098
Mary was pregnant
at the time of the Crucifixion.

01:11:09.849 --> 01:11:14.320
For her own safety
and for that of Christ's unborn child,

01:11:14.395 --> 01:11:17.444
she fled the Holy Land and came to France.

01:11:17.523 --> 01:11:22.620
And here, it is said,
she gave birth to a daughter, Sarah.

01:11:23.946 --> 01:11:26.324
They know the child's name.

01:11:27.283 --> 01:11:29.160
- A little girl.
- Yes.

01:11:29.368 --> 01:11:31.587
If that were true,
it's adding insult to injury.

01:11:31.662 --> 01:11:32.709
Why?

01:11:32.914 --> 01:11:36.544
The pagans found transcendence
through the joining of male to female.

01:11:36.751 --> 01:11:38.469
People found God through sex?

01:11:38.669 --> 01:11:41.639
In paganism, women were worshiped
as a route to heaven,

01:11:41.714 --> 01:11:44.558
but the modern Church has a monopoly on that

01:11:44.717 --> 01:11:46.685
in salvation through Jesus Christ.

01:11:46.761 --> 01:11:50.015
And he who keeps the keys to heaven
rules the world.

01:11:50.097 --> 01:11:52.441
Women, then, are a huge threat to the Church.

01:11:53.476 --> 01:11:55.444
The Catholic Inquisition soon publishes

01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:58.820
what may be the most blood-soaked book
in human history.

01:11:59.023 --> 01:12:01.401
The Malleus Maleficarum.

01:12:02.527 --> 01:12:04.404
The Witches' Hammer.

01:12:04.487 --> 01:12:08.333
It instructed the clergy on how
to locate, torture and kill

01:12:08.407 --> 01:12:09.829
all freethinking women.

01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:16.049
In three centuries of witch hunts,

01:12:16.457 --> 01:12:20.303
50, 000 women are captured,
burned alive at the stake.

01:12:20.378 --> 01:12:23.006
At least that. Some say millions.

01:12:23.589 --> 01:12:25.307
Imagine, then, Robert,

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:29.680
that Christ's throne
might live on in a female child.

01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:33.684
You asked what would be worth killing for.

01:12:34.267 --> 01:12:37.862
Witness the greatest cover-up
in human history.

01:12:38.646 --> 01:12:41.024
This is the secret that the Priory of Sion

01:12:41.107 --> 01:12:43.485
has defended for over 20 centuries.

01:12:43.568 --> 01:12:46.742
They are the guardians
of the royal bloodline.

01:12:47.405 --> 01:12:51.000
The keepers of the proof of our true past.

01:12:51.075 --> 01:12:55.080
They are the protectors of the living
descendants of Jesus Christ

01:12:57.206 --> 01:12:58.958
and Mary Magdalene.

01:13:08.718 --> 01:13:09.970
Sir Leigh?

01:13:10.761 --> 01:13:14.061
Sometimes I wonder who is serving whom.

01:13:14.765 --> 01:13:17.814
His sauces are not that fantastic.

01:13:20.187 --> 01:13:21.780
Yes, can I help you?

01:13:21.856 --> 01:13:23.904
Yes. They're on the news now.

01:13:26.944 --> 01:13:30.369
Living descendants? Is it possible?

01:13:30.448 --> 01:13:32.075
It's not impossible.

01:13:33.326 --> 01:13:37.001
You have not been honest with me.
Your pictures are on the television.

01:13:37.079 --> 01:13:39.002
You are wanted for four murders!

01:13:39.415 --> 01:13:41.588
That's why Vernet said, "Killing spree."

01:13:41.667 --> 01:13:45.422
You come into my home,
playing on my passions for the Grail.

01:13:45.504 --> 01:13:48.098
- That's why he needed you, Sophie.
- You will leave my house!

01:13:48.174 --> 01:13:50.176
- Leigh, listen!
- No, I'm calling the police.

01:13:50.259 --> 01:13:52.261
Jacques Saunière was her grandfather.

01:13:55.598 --> 01:13:57.350
You're the obsessive Priory scholar, Leigh.

01:13:57.433 --> 01:13:59.686
You still keep lists
of who might be in the Priory?

01:14:00.853 --> 01:14:03.697
I'll bet Jacques Saunière
was on one of those lists.

01:14:05.650 --> 01:14:08.153
He was on your list of who could
be Grand Master, wasn't he?

01:14:08.486 --> 01:14:11.035
- What?
- I'll bet he was right at the top.

01:14:11.238 --> 01:14:16.540
Consider. Four men murdered?
The same number as the guardians.

01:14:16.619 --> 01:14:19.873
What if the Priory was compromised,
the other sénéchaux dead?

01:14:20.081 --> 01:14:22.209
What if you yourself were dying,
a Grand Master?

01:14:22.833 --> 01:14:26.303
You'd have to pass the secret on
to someone you could trust.

01:14:26.504 --> 01:14:28.222
Someone outside the society.

01:14:28.381 --> 01:14:33.057
Maybe someone whose training
you had begun but never finished.

01:14:35.972 --> 01:14:38.475
Robert, your ruse is pathetic.

01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:40.977
Not really.

01:14:42.561 --> 01:14:44.780
No, that's impossible.

01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:49.573
Can that really...

01:14:51.946 --> 01:14:53.243
Is it the keystone?

01:14:56.617 --> 01:14:59.245
I'll even show it to you, Leigh.

01:14:59.328 --> 01:15:01.501
Will you just tell us what the hell it's for?

01:15:19.432 --> 01:15:21.105
Fache says to wait, so I wait.

01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:25.446
What's Fache thinking?
The truck is here. They're inside.

01:15:34.238 --> 01:15:35.364
Yes.

01:15:35.573 --> 01:15:38.372
As the legend foretold,

01:15:40.161 --> 01:15:42.459
"It hides beneath the Rose."

01:15:42.538 --> 01:15:44.131
Oh, my.

01:15:51.047 --> 01:15:52.515
Leigh.

01:15:55.926 --> 01:15:57.394
Leigh?

01:15:58.262 --> 01:15:59.309
Please.

01:15:59.513 --> 01:16:01.515
I'm sorry. Yes, of course.

01:16:03.934 --> 01:16:05.982
Inside the keystone,

01:16:07.313 --> 01:16:08.940
there'll be a map.

01:16:09.023 --> 01:16:11.822
A map that will lead us to the Holy Grail.

01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:18.704
To be trained by the Grand Master himself.

01:16:19.158 --> 01:16:23.004
Did he pass down the fleur-de-lis?
Is that how you found this?

01:16:25.539 --> 01:16:28.543
And he must have sung you the riddle songs.

01:16:28.626 --> 01:16:30.173
I know some of them.

01:16:39.428 --> 01:16:41.271
Can you keep secrets?

01:16:42.848 --> 01:16:45.727
Can you know a thing and never say it again?

01:16:46.811 --> 01:16:47.858
And codes?

01:16:49.146 --> 01:16:53.151
I imagine they lie down for you like lovers.

01:16:56.153 --> 01:17:01.159
A sénéchal. A guardian of the Grail
right here in my own home.

01:17:01.242 --> 01:17:04.212
Tell him, please. I don't know any of this.

01:17:04.328 --> 01:17:07.207
Leigh, it's not that simple. She doesn't...

01:17:08.749 --> 01:17:10.001
Robert!

01:17:15.339 --> 01:17:16.716
Do not move, woman.

01:17:20.970 --> 01:17:21.971
Cripple.

01:17:24.348 --> 01:17:25.895
Put the box on the table.

01:17:27.059 --> 01:17:28.436
What, this trifle?

01:17:29.019 --> 01:17:32.649
Well, perhaps we can make
a financial arrangement.

01:17:33.190 --> 01:17:36.239
Put the keystone on the table.

01:17:37.194 --> 01:17:38.821
You will not succeed.

01:17:41.115 --> 01:17:44.289
Only the worthy can unlock the stone.

01:18:13.647 --> 01:18:16.070
Rip the gate down.

01:18:19.570 --> 01:18:21.288
Well, well, my dear.

01:18:25.451 --> 01:18:26.794
Sit down.

01:18:26.952 --> 01:18:28.374
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:18:28.579 --> 01:18:30.707
- Are you?
- Yeah.

01:18:30.915 --> 01:18:33.213
Yes, well, make yourself useful,
you French fool.

01:18:33.292 --> 01:18:35.465
Get something to restrain this monster.

01:18:40.633 --> 01:18:42.226
Above the joint.

01:18:43.093 --> 01:18:47.143
Fortunately, a dragon most easy to slay.

01:18:47.848 --> 01:18:49.270
He's wearing a cilice.

01:18:50.059 --> 01:18:52.278
- A what?
- Well, look.

01:18:54.772 --> 01:18:57.742
Inflicts pain so he can suffer
as Christ suffered.

01:18:57.816 --> 01:18:58.942
Opus Dei.

01:18:59.026 --> 01:19:00.528
Fache is Opus Dei.

01:19:02.029 --> 01:19:05.124
The policeman who's chasing us.
He wears the cross in the world.

01:19:05.199 --> 01:19:06.200
Robert.

01:19:09.161 --> 01:19:12.461
Well, I must say,
you two are anything but dull.

01:19:13.707 --> 01:19:14.708
Leigh?

01:19:16.919 --> 01:19:18.341
You want what's in this box?

01:19:20.005 --> 01:19:21.848
We need a way out of here.

01:19:21.924 --> 01:19:26.145
Well, actually, I do have a plane.

01:19:37.273 --> 01:19:39.241
- Robert! Where do we go?
- Come along.

01:19:39.316 --> 01:19:41.159
- In here. Come in.
- Over here.

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:43.829
Get the door. Hurry

01:19:45.864 --> 01:19:47.912
Over here. Over here. Sophie.

01:19:47.992 --> 01:19:49.244
Watch out!

01:19:50.619 --> 01:19:52.246
Be careful.

01:19:52.329 --> 01:19:53.546
Come, Rem...

01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:02.723
Shit.

01:20:05.801 --> 01:20:06.848
Easy.

01:20:29.867 --> 01:20:30.959
Jesus!

01:20:31.035 --> 01:20:32.082
Apropos.

01:20:34.872 --> 01:20:36.715
I can't imagine what your complaint is.

01:20:36.790 --> 01:20:39.794
I'd be within my rights to shoot you
and let you rot in my woods!

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:42.338
Put that away. We might need him.

01:20:43.130 --> 01:20:44.256
Better.

01:20:51.263 --> 01:20:52.890
Opus Dei.

01:20:53.849 --> 01:20:56.477
- What is it?
- A conservative Catholic sect.

01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:58.483
Opus Dei is a prelature to the Vatican.

01:20:58.562 --> 01:21:02.066
You're saying the Vatican
is killing people for this box?

01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:04.197
No, no, no. Not the Vatican

01:21:04.276 --> 01:21:06.904
and not Opus Dei,
but we are in the middle of a war.

01:21:06.987 --> 01:21:09.536
And one that has been going on forever.

01:21:09.615 --> 01:21:11.868
On the one side stands the Priory

01:21:11.950 --> 01:21:14.794
and on the other an ancient group of despots

01:21:14.912 --> 01:21:17.290
with members hidden in high-ranking positions

01:21:17.373 --> 01:21:19.250
throughout the Church.

01:21:19.333 --> 01:21:23.634
And this Council of Shadows tries
to destroy proof of the bloodline.

01:21:23.712 --> 01:21:26.966
And that throughout history,
they seek out and kill

01:21:27.049 --> 01:21:28.926
the living descendants of Jesus Christ.

01:21:29.009 --> 01:21:30.852
- That's insane.
- Is it?

01:21:32.554 --> 01:21:33.680
What if the world discovers

01:21:33.764 --> 01:21:36.893
that the greatest story ever told
is actually a lie?

01:21:36.975 --> 01:21:40.650
The Vatican faces
a crisis of faith unprecedented.

01:21:41.397 --> 01:21:44.025
I've got a signal now, sir. It's ringing.

01:21:45.818 --> 01:21:50.324
Roger, look, I'm so sorry.
I've got tired of the weather here in France

01:21:50.406 --> 01:21:53.330
and could you make the plane ready for...

01:21:56.203 --> 01:21:57.375
Zürich.

01:21:57.955 --> 01:21:59.423
Yes. No, we love Zürich.

01:22:07.297 --> 01:22:09.846
What the hell do you mean,
you lost them? Collet.

01:22:11.969 --> 01:22:13.437
You're the one who lost them.

01:22:13.804 --> 01:22:15.181
You control every step of this investigation.

01:22:15.347 --> 01:22:17.941
You don't let anybody breathe.

01:22:18.434 --> 01:22:21.153
You're acting like you lost your mind.

01:22:24.523 --> 01:22:27.367
What is it with these two birds?

01:22:31.447 --> 01:22:34.326
Interpol just registered a new
flight plan from Le Bourget.

01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:38.454
Stay out of my way on this, Collet.

01:23:06.064 --> 01:23:07.907
Did you kill Jacques Saunière?

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:13.368
Did you kill Jacques Saunière?

01:23:14.323 --> 01:23:16.121
I am the messenger of God.

01:23:19.995 --> 01:23:22.168
Did you kill my grandfather?

01:23:25.292 --> 01:23:26.760
I am the messenger...

01:23:27.419 --> 01:23:31.469
Each breath you take is a sin.

01:23:32.966 --> 01:23:35.389
No shadow will be safe again.

01:23:35.594 --> 01:23:40.316
For you will be hunted by angels.

01:23:41.767 --> 01:23:43.735
You believe in God?

01:23:44.978 --> 01:23:47.481
Your God doesn't forgive murderers.

01:23:51.026 --> 01:23:52.869
He burns them.

01:24:04.081 --> 01:24:05.082
Sophie.

01:24:31.692 --> 01:24:33.410
The Teacher will be pleased.

01:24:33.485 --> 01:24:35.783
What will you do once you have the Grail?

01:24:35.862 --> 01:24:36.909
Destroy it.

01:24:36.989 --> 01:24:40.664
The documents and the sarcophagus, of course.

01:24:42.327 --> 01:24:43.704
And the heir?

01:24:47.499 --> 01:24:51.003
Will you exercise the final edict?
Spill his blood?

01:24:51.587 --> 01:24:53.180
There will be no need.

01:24:53.255 --> 01:24:58.102
Once the sarcophagus is destroyed,
DNA testing will be impossible.

01:24:58.176 --> 01:25:00.895
There is no way to prove a living bloodline.

01:25:01.597 --> 01:25:03.224
But if you had to,

01:25:04.850 --> 01:25:07.899
would you do as councils have done before us?

01:25:16.862 --> 01:25:18.205
Christ...

01:25:22.909 --> 01:25:27.210
Christ sacrificed his life
for the betterment of humanity.

01:25:30.834 --> 01:25:33.713
So, too, may be the fate of his seed.

01:25:40.886 --> 01:25:42.684
I need the flight plan.

01:25:42.971 --> 01:25:44.018
Ten minutes.

01:25:44.973 --> 01:25:47.351
I asked you to get it for me.

01:25:48.477 --> 01:25:50.400
I'm on break.

01:25:51.855 --> 01:25:53.448
Come back in 10 minutes.

01:25:55.442 --> 01:25:57.615
My nose! My nose!

01:25:58.195 --> 01:25:59.617
The flight plan, please.

01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:00.781
You asshole!

01:26:14.044 --> 01:26:15.762
It's not "cross."

01:26:17.005 --> 01:26:18.302
"Spear"?

01:26:22.886 --> 01:26:24.433
What happened to her?

01:26:25.222 --> 01:26:26.815
No one knows.

01:26:27.182 --> 01:26:30.527
Mary Magdalene lived out her days in hiding.

01:26:32.312 --> 01:26:34.735
And the zealots pursued her still,

01:26:35.315 --> 01:26:39.695
even in death,
trying to destroy proof of her existence.

01:26:40.696 --> 01:26:43.040
But she always had her Knights.

01:26:43.115 --> 01:26:45.584
Brave men sworn to defend her.

01:26:45.867 --> 01:26:48.461
You see, to worship before her sarcophagus,

01:26:48.954 --> 01:26:52.333
to kneel before the bones of Mary Magdalene,

01:26:52.416 --> 01:26:55.716
was to remember all those
who were robbed of their power,

01:26:55.794 --> 01:26:56.795
who were oppressed.

01:26:57.170 --> 01:27:01.721
Ultimately, the Priory hid her remains
and the proof of her bloodline

01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:04.474
until most believed her sarcophagus,

01:27:05.470 --> 01:27:07.143
the Holy Grail,

01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:11.110
was finally lost in time.

01:27:22.028 --> 01:27:23.029
What are you doing?

01:27:23.113 --> 01:27:25.787
At the chateau, you said,
"It hides beneath the Rose."

01:27:25.866 --> 01:27:27.334
No, no, no. Do be careful.

01:27:27.659 --> 01:27:32.665
- In Latin, sub rosa. Literal translation.
- "Beneath the rose."

01:27:46.052 --> 01:27:47.520
We need a mirror.

01:27:47.721 --> 01:27:50.565
Backwards. In the style of Leonardo himself.

01:27:50.766 --> 01:27:51.892
Thank you.

01:27:56.772 --> 01:28:00.743
"In London lies a knight a Pope interred

01:28:00.942 --> 01:28:04.663
"His labor's fruit a Holy wrath incurred

01:28:05.030 --> 01:28:08.000
"You seek the orb that ought be on his tomb

01:28:08.366 --> 01:28:12.041
"It speaks of Rosy flesh and seeded womb"

01:28:12.204 --> 01:28:16.175
"In London lies a knight a Pope interred"?

01:28:16.374 --> 01:28:20.174
A knight whose funeral
was presided over by the Pope.

01:28:20.378 --> 01:28:23.678
Of course, the Priory knights
were not just any knights.

01:28:23.757 --> 01:28:24.849
Templars.

01:28:24.925 --> 01:28:28.020
And there's just one place to bury
a Templar knight in London.

01:28:28.094 --> 01:28:29.220
Temple Church.

01:28:29.304 --> 01:28:31.477
Temple Church. If you'll excuse me, my dear,

01:28:31.556 --> 01:28:34.400
Roger and I must discuss
a change in flight plan.

01:28:34.935 --> 01:28:36.312
Leigh.

01:28:38.063 --> 01:28:40.441
Harboring and transporting fugitives?

01:28:41.233 --> 01:28:43.782
You are already implicated enough.

01:28:44.986 --> 01:28:48.581
You and I, Robert, have observed history.

01:28:48.782 --> 01:28:50.580
Time has been our glass.

01:28:51.576 --> 01:28:54.796
We are in history now. Living it.

01:28:56.498 --> 01:28:58.125
Making it.

01:28:58.834 --> 01:29:00.427
"Implicated"?

01:29:00.502 --> 01:29:03.051
I am on a Grail quest.

01:29:04.673 --> 01:29:06.300
Forgive me, Robert,

01:29:06.383 --> 01:29:08.806
but you two may well have given this old man

01:29:08.885 --> 01:29:11.229
the greatest night of his life.

01:29:13.098 --> 01:29:14.224
Thank you.

01:29:16.309 --> 01:29:18.437
He's going to want more money.

01:29:35.620 --> 01:29:39.750
I suppose this is a new technique
for investigations.

01:29:39.916 --> 01:29:45.047
I've lost them. They flew to Switzerland.

01:29:45.297 --> 01:29:47.516
No extradition.

01:29:50.260 --> 01:29:56.563
The controller filed charges.
Ari was on dispatch. He called me.

01:30:00.645 --> 01:30:03.740
What's going on, Bezu?

01:30:06.735 --> 01:30:09.614
You know that I am Opus Dei?

01:30:09.988 --> 01:30:11.535
Yes.

01:30:16.828 --> 01:30:20.332
A bishop of my order called me.

01:30:20.665 --> 01:30:22.793
He said a killer came to him in confession.

01:30:22.959 --> 01:30:25.712
His name was Robert Langdon.

01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:30.009
He said I couldn't imagine
the evil in this man's heart.

01:30:30.175 --> 01:30:32.928
That he would keep killing.

01:30:33.303 --> 01:30:35.772
He said I had to stop him.

01:30:37.807 --> 01:30:41.653
The bishop broke his vows to tell me this.

01:30:41.811 --> 01:30:45.236
He charged me to stop Robert Langdon.

01:30:48.193 --> 01:30:52.949
Tell me, Collet, who have I failed?

01:30:53.740 --> 01:30:55.538
The bishop?

01:30:56.868 --> 01:30:58.962
God himself?

01:31:07.587 --> 01:31:10.716
They've changed their flight plan to London.

01:31:39.411 --> 01:31:43.132
I have them, tower.
Relay Hawker to land and hold on tarmac.

01:32:40.430 --> 01:32:42.649
- Secure the area!
- Wider!

01:32:42.807 --> 01:32:44.935
- Armed police!
- You two, round the back!

01:32:45.310 --> 01:32:48.484
Armed police! Put your hands in the air!

01:32:48.688 --> 01:32:50.486
- Three men up!
- Ready!

01:32:50.565 --> 01:32:52.863
Put your hands in the air! Do it now!

01:32:53.651 --> 01:32:56.029
I'm afraid that's easier said than done
in my case.

01:32:58.114 --> 01:32:59.411
Good morning.

01:32:59.491 --> 01:33:02.586
Did that old cannabis charge
finally catch up with me?

01:33:02.660 --> 01:33:05.504
Sir, the French police say
you're transporting fugitives,

01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:07.332
and you may have a hostage onboard.

01:33:07.415 --> 01:33:08.883
I'm to take you all into custody.

01:33:08.958 --> 01:33:11.461
Sadly, I have an important
medical appointment

01:33:11.544 --> 01:33:12.761
which I can't afford to miss.

01:33:12.837 --> 01:33:14.054
I'll fetch the car, sir.

01:33:14.130 --> 01:33:16.974
This is serious, sir.
The French police are on their way. Stop!

01:33:17.675 --> 01:33:20.849
Inspector, I can't afford the time
to indulge your games.

01:33:20.929 --> 01:33:22.306
I'm late and I'm leaving.

01:33:22.388 --> 01:33:24.436
If it's so important for you to stop us,

01:33:24.516 --> 01:33:26.735
then you're just going to have to shoot us.

01:33:27.519 --> 01:33:28.941
You can start with him.

01:33:34.234 --> 01:33:35.611
Search the plane.

01:33:36.319 --> 01:33:37.536
All right.

01:33:49.749 --> 01:33:51.422
I could run them over.

01:33:56.881 --> 01:33:57.882
Bad tip.

01:33:59.843 --> 01:34:01.220
Let him go.

01:34:05.807 --> 01:34:08.185
The French cannot be trusted.

01:34:16.943 --> 01:34:17.990
Everyone comfy?

01:34:20.446 --> 01:34:21.493
Biscuits?

01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:23.458
They didn't notice anything?

01:34:24.075 --> 01:34:28.251
Well, people rarely notice things
right in front of their eyes, don't you find?

01:34:42.468 --> 01:34:45.062
Do you have the bonds, bishop?

01:34:45.263 --> 01:34:46.515
Yes, I do, Teacher.

01:34:46.681 --> 01:34:50.026
I have chosen an Opus Dei
residence for the exchange.

01:34:50.185 --> 01:34:51.653
I am honored.

01:34:51.895 --> 01:34:56.742
By the time you get to London,
I will have the Grail.

01:35:02.113 --> 01:35:06.960
Remember, if we are discovered by
the Vatican, we are excommunicated.

01:35:07.035 --> 01:35:10.039
- So should anything go wrong...
- Yes, I know, I know.

01:35:11.456 --> 01:35:13.129
This council does not exist.

01:35:14.125 --> 01:35:15.843
As it never has.

01:35:18.713 --> 01:35:22.468
Old friend. Heaven protect you.

01:35:29.974 --> 01:35:31.942
Keep an eye out for the police.

01:35:45.073 --> 01:35:47.826
I must say, Robert, I'm quite impressed

01:35:47.909 --> 01:35:51.163
by the way you withstood my little airplane.

01:35:52.830 --> 01:35:54.457
Did he never tell you?

01:35:54.540 --> 01:35:57.965
When he was a boy,
young Robert fell into a well.

01:35:58.044 --> 01:35:59.796
How old were you?

01:35:59.879 --> 01:36:01.005
Seven.

01:36:03.716 --> 01:36:07.095
Treading water all night long,
screaming his lungs out

01:36:07.178 --> 01:36:09.101
to the echoes screaming back.

01:36:09.180 --> 01:36:11.729
When they found him, he was nearly catatonic.

01:36:11.933 --> 01:36:13.025
Help!

01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:15.528
It was a long time ago.

01:36:15.603 --> 01:36:17.480
Now, now, Robert.

01:36:17.563 --> 01:36:21.864
You, above all people, shouldn't be one
to dismiss the influence of the past.

01:36:27.573 --> 01:36:31.794
Tell me, why has the Priory kept
the Grail location secret all these years?

01:36:31.869 --> 01:36:32.870
I don't know.

01:36:33.413 --> 01:36:36.166
Some say the Priory wait
for the heir to reveal himself,

01:36:36.249 --> 01:36:38.047
which is especially odd

01:36:38.209 --> 01:36:41.554
since legend suggests
he may not know his own true identity.

01:36:49.554 --> 01:36:50.555
Hello?

01:36:51.347 --> 01:36:53.975
Why do they make them so scary?

01:36:59.605 --> 01:37:00.731
It's cold.

01:37:00.898 --> 01:37:04.243
"In London lies a knight a Pope interred."

01:37:13.536 --> 01:37:16.915
So which tomb has an orb?

01:37:19.250 --> 01:37:22.629
Two wear tunics over their armor

01:37:22.712 --> 01:37:25.841
and two have full-length robes.

01:37:26.924 --> 01:37:28.642
Two are grasping swords.

01:37:29.093 --> 01:37:32.723
And one... Two are praying.

01:37:34.682 --> 01:37:36.776
This one has his arms at his sides.

01:37:36.851 --> 01:37:40.526
And this poor fellow
has almost disappeared entirely.

01:37:40.730 --> 01:37:45.452
I don't see any orb that ought be on a tomb.

01:37:46.319 --> 01:37:49.198
"Ought be on his tomb."
Are we looking for a missing orb?

01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:51.123
Maybe. Over here, see.

01:37:56.162 --> 01:37:57.880
These aren't tombs.

01:37:57.955 --> 01:38:00.424
- What? Yes, of course they are.
- No.

01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:02.628
- They're effigies.
- What?

01:38:02.710 --> 01:38:04.804
Not tombs. There's no bodies here.

01:38:04.962 --> 01:38:06.430
This place is wrong.

01:38:08.466 --> 01:38:11.811
Can we go now? We should go.

01:38:14.972 --> 01:38:16.474
Sophie! No!

01:38:18.434 --> 01:38:19.856
Where is the keystone?

01:38:20.978 --> 01:38:22.230
Do not test me!

01:38:22.313 --> 01:38:23.610
- Let her go!
- Don't you hurt her.

01:38:23.689 --> 01:38:25.783
- Give me the keystone! Give it to me!
- Can you stop that?

01:38:25.858 --> 01:38:27.610
Here! Here! Here it is! Here it is.

01:38:27.693 --> 01:38:30.947
Just let her go, and you and I can...
We'll come to some agreement.

01:38:32.198 --> 01:38:33.666
Remy.

01:38:36.994 --> 01:38:39.543
Remy. No, no, no. No, put it away.

01:38:40.832 --> 01:38:43.176
Put it away. They're too close together.
You don't have a clear shot.

01:38:44.293 --> 01:38:46.671
- Yes, I do.
- Stop that. What do you think you're doing?

01:38:48.923 --> 01:38:53.303
Thank you, Professor.
For a moment, this was getting complicated.

01:38:53.386 --> 01:38:55.480
This is absurd. For God's sake, man!

01:38:58.933 --> 01:39:01.152
That was satisfying.

01:39:01.227 --> 01:39:03.104
I'm glad this bullshit is over.

01:39:06.357 --> 01:39:08.075
Throw Teabing in the trunk.

01:39:08.276 --> 01:39:09.528
What?

01:39:14.949 --> 01:39:16.496
Here. You okay?

01:39:22.373 --> 01:39:23.374
Sorry.

01:40:04.415 --> 01:40:06.213
I don't think he's following.

01:40:14.425 --> 01:40:18.305
They won't kill Leigh
until they find the Grail.

01:40:20.431 --> 01:40:23.651
- So we have to find it before they do.
- I have to get to a library, fast.

01:40:31.609 --> 01:40:35.955
He once whined to me about
the wasted space of so large a trunk.

01:40:36.989 --> 01:40:39.117
Let's see if he complains so now.

01:40:40.201 --> 01:40:42.124
Are you the Teacher?

01:40:45.373 --> 01:40:46.420
I am.

01:40:48.209 --> 01:40:52.715
Superbly done. You've been of great service.

01:40:56.217 --> 01:40:59.221
The cryptex has yet to be opened.
I can still serve.

01:40:59.303 --> 01:41:01.476
You've done enough.

01:41:04.559 --> 01:41:08.234
We cannot let ego deter us from our goal.

01:41:09.438 --> 01:41:11.406
I understand.

01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:13.526
Good.

01:41:16.737 --> 01:41:21.618
Wait here, at this house of Opus Dei,
and you will be rewarded.

01:41:21.701 --> 01:41:23.920
I will dispose of the old man.

01:41:25.079 --> 01:41:26.706
Bless you, Silas.

01:41:28.749 --> 01:41:30.001
Teacher.

01:41:38.175 --> 01:41:39.927
Christ be with you.

01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:47.527
We're at least a half-hour
to Chelsea Library.

01:41:48.102 --> 01:41:50.150
If we're gonna help Leigh, that's too long.

01:42:01.866 --> 01:42:03.368
Where are you going?

01:42:03.451 --> 01:42:05.579
Getting you a library card.

01:42:09.206 --> 01:42:11.334
Excuse me. May I sit next to you?

01:42:11.417 --> 01:42:13.920
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

01:42:22.470 --> 01:42:23.767
That's great.

01:42:24.722 --> 01:42:26.895
Didn't say you had a boyfriend.

01:42:29.602 --> 01:42:30.899
Thanks.

01:42:31.562 --> 01:42:33.906
Let's see if we can access
the database on this.

01:42:35.232 --> 01:42:38.577
"In London lies a knight a Pope interred."

01:42:38.653 --> 01:42:40.405
Compounding keywords.

01:42:40.613 --> 01:42:43.492
Knight, Pope, Grail.

01:42:44.116 --> 01:42:48.121
Your precious treasure
was almost lost, and with it, my fortune.

01:42:52.541 --> 01:42:54.794
Can you believe how well I did?

01:42:56.379 --> 01:42:58.507
I even convinced the monk.

01:42:59.382 --> 01:43:01.305
I should be in theater.

01:43:08.015 --> 01:43:11.019
A toast to our success, Teacher.

01:43:11.102 --> 01:43:13.525
The end of the journey is near.

01:43:16.065 --> 01:43:19.365
Your identity shall go with me to the grave.

01:43:24.782 --> 01:43:28.457
There's your problem, mate.
It's your basic linguistic coincidence.

01:43:28.869 --> 01:43:31.122
See, keywords keep coming up
with the writings

01:43:31.205 --> 01:43:34.254
of some bloke named Alexander Pope.

01:43:34.333 --> 01:43:35.585
"A. Pope."

01:43:37.211 --> 01:43:38.963
Your grandfather was a genius.

01:43:43.884 --> 01:43:44.931
Come on.

01:44:19.587 --> 01:44:21.430
Emergency. Which service do you require?

01:44:21.505 --> 01:44:26.602
I know the location of two murderers
wanted by French police.

01:44:30.514 --> 01:44:32.733
We've just had a 999 call.

01:44:32.808 --> 01:44:35.277
Triangulation leads back to Docklands.

01:44:35.352 --> 01:44:37.525
Caller was male. Claimed your two murderers

01:44:37.605 --> 01:44:40.199
are hiding at an Opus Dei house.

01:44:49.366 --> 01:44:53.462
The knight we're looking for
is Sir Isaac Newton.

01:44:54.997 --> 01:44:58.718
His life's work produced new sciences
that incurred the wrath of the Church.

01:44:59.210 --> 01:45:01.463
Gravity, for God sakes.

01:45:02.838 --> 01:45:06.012
And if you choose to believe,

01:45:06.091 --> 01:45:10.517
he was also a Grand Master
of the Priory as well.

01:45:21.232 --> 01:45:23.701
But if he offended the Catholic Church,

01:45:23.776 --> 01:45:27.656
the Pope would be the last person
to preside over his funeral.

01:45:27.738 --> 01:45:30.161
Well, that's where I got it wrong.

01:45:30.241 --> 01:45:33.415
"In London lies a knight a Pope interred."

01:45:33.494 --> 01:45:36.293
Sir Isaac Newton's funeral was presided over

01:45:36.372 --> 01:45:40.502
by his good friend,
his colleague, Alexander Pope.

01:45:40.584 --> 01:45:43.087
A. Pope. His first initial.

01:45:43.170 --> 01:45:44.672
How did I miss that?

01:45:45.422 --> 01:45:46.469
Here.

01:45:46.549 --> 01:45:49.678
Yes. Isaac Newton's tomb.

01:45:50.970 --> 01:45:52.313
An orb.

01:45:52.388 --> 01:45:54.061
Yes. Which one?

01:45:54.890 --> 01:45:57.484
It's not possible to tell
if a particular orb is missing.

01:45:57.560 --> 01:46:01.190
"An orb with Rosy flesh and seeded womb."

01:46:01.272 --> 01:46:03.366
Solar system. The planets.

01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:05.943
Constellations. Signs of the zodiac.

01:46:06.527 --> 01:46:08.700
See, our moon is missing.

01:46:08.779 --> 01:46:11.157
The moons of Saturn and Jupiter.
They're not here.

01:46:12.074 --> 01:46:14.247
Eyes of the cherubs themselves?

01:46:16.579 --> 01:46:19.128
Robert. These tracks.

01:46:20.249 --> 01:46:22.547
Look at the cane marks in the dust.

01:46:25.754 --> 01:46:27.131
Teabing was here.

01:46:28.549 --> 01:46:29.801
He was alone.

01:46:31.635 --> 01:46:35.731
When the two of you
arrived at my home as you did,

01:46:36.932 --> 01:46:39.435
others might call it God's will.

01:46:40.686 --> 01:46:43.189
I believed that if I had the cryptex

01:46:43.314 --> 01:46:45.737
I could solve the riddle alone.

01:46:47.484 --> 01:46:49.157
But I was unworthy.

01:46:49.236 --> 01:46:50.283
But you...

01:46:51.238 --> 01:46:53.787
You have a reason to be here.

01:46:53.866 --> 01:46:57.086
You're the last remaining guardian
of the Grail.

01:46:57.828 --> 01:47:00.047
Your grandfather and the other sénéchaux

01:47:00.122 --> 01:47:02.045
would not have lied with dying breath

01:47:02.124 --> 01:47:04.968
unless they knew their secret was preserved.

01:47:07.588 --> 01:47:10.262
How could you know Saunière's last words?

01:47:10.341 --> 01:47:11.388
Leigh.

01:47:12.509 --> 01:47:14.762
Grail quests require sacrifice.

01:47:15.387 --> 01:47:16.809
You are a murderer.

01:47:16.889 --> 01:47:20.143
No. No. Robert, tell her.

01:47:20.225 --> 01:47:24.025
When history is written,
murderers are heroes.

01:47:26.190 --> 01:47:28.192
You self-righteous bastard!

01:47:28.275 --> 01:47:29.697
We... We need to just walk away.

01:47:29.777 --> 01:47:31.575
- No, don't. Don't.
- Walk away.

01:47:35.032 --> 01:47:36.534
I'll do what I have to now.

01:47:41.872 --> 01:47:43.044
Anything.

01:47:47.211 --> 01:47:48.633
Do you understand?

01:47:50.339 --> 01:47:51.716
So now,

01:47:53.217 --> 01:47:55.219
can't we all be friends again?

01:47:56.553 --> 01:47:57.850
This way.

01:48:34.091 --> 01:48:37.937
I'm going to put this gun down.
I only want you both to listen.

01:48:39.763 --> 01:48:40.935
I'm listening now.

01:48:41.432 --> 01:48:42.934
For 2000 years

01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:47.480
the Church has rained oppression
and atrocity upon mankind,

01:48:48.147 --> 01:48:53.119
crushed passion and idea alike,
all in the name of their walking God.

01:48:53.527 --> 01:48:57.907
Proof of Jesus' mortality can bring
an end to all that suffering,

01:48:58.449 --> 01:49:00.622
drive this church of lies to its knees.

01:49:02.870 --> 01:49:03.962
Armed police!

01:49:04.830 --> 01:49:06.127
Drop your weapon!

01:49:09.668 --> 01:49:10.669
Stop, Silas!

01:49:23.474 --> 01:49:26.318
We are betrayed, my son.

01:49:27.311 --> 01:49:29.439
The living heir must be revealed.

01:49:30.397 --> 01:49:32.695
Jesus must be shown for what he was.

01:49:32.775 --> 01:49:35.654
Not miraculous, simply man.

01:49:37.154 --> 01:49:38.326
I'm sorry.

01:49:40.783 --> 01:49:41.875
Armed police!

01:49:42.326 --> 01:49:45.455
Drop your weapon! Drop it! Drop it!

01:49:55.089 --> 01:49:57.683
Put it down now! Put it down!

01:50:05.432 --> 01:50:07.526
I am a ghost.

01:50:08.602 --> 01:50:11.355
The dark con can be exposed.

01:50:11.438 --> 01:50:16.410
Mankind can finally be set free,
and we can do it, Robert.

01:50:18.028 --> 01:50:19.325
The three of us.

01:50:37.464 --> 01:50:38.716
How is Silas?

01:50:39.049 --> 01:50:41.393
Is he... Is he alive?

01:50:41.885 --> 01:50:42.932
The monk?

01:50:46.473 --> 01:50:49.397
Bishop, how would you know
this killer's name?

01:50:50.769 --> 01:50:52.487
Get me out of here, Fache.

01:50:53.105 --> 01:50:54.231
Wait.

01:50:57.651 --> 01:51:00.746
Langdon never came to you
in confession, did he?

01:51:01.405 --> 01:51:05.285
One of your followers called you
about the crime-scene photos.

01:51:06.577 --> 01:51:08.250
I cannot be implicated here.

01:51:09.496 --> 01:51:11.624
There are still important works to be done.

01:51:13.250 --> 01:51:14.593
You used me.

01:51:16.503 --> 01:51:18.551
God uses us all.

01:51:19.339 --> 01:51:20.886
Help me, Fache.

01:51:22.050 --> 01:51:23.176
Take him.

01:51:27.931 --> 01:51:29.774
- Did you get his cell phone?
- Yes, sir.

01:51:29.850 --> 01:51:31.898
I'm going to need a trace.

01:51:34.771 --> 01:51:36.614
Your Silas is dead.

01:51:43.697 --> 01:51:45.620
The Priory's sacred charge

01:51:45.699 --> 01:51:48.748
was to reveal the heir
at the dawn of the new millennium.

01:51:49.661 --> 01:51:54.588
The millennium came and went
and the living heir remained hidden.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:58.470
The Priory failed in their sacred charge.

01:51:59.713 --> 01:52:01.761
So, what choice did I have?

01:52:06.011 --> 01:52:07.809
I sought out the enemy.

01:52:09.306 --> 01:52:13.277
I persuaded them, the Council of Shadows,
that I was an ally.

01:52:14.269 --> 01:52:17.569
I even asked them for money
so they would never suspect me.

01:52:18.440 --> 01:52:20.989
Rector, I made them call me.

01:52:21.944 --> 01:52:23.070
"Teacher."

01:52:23.153 --> 01:52:24.496
- Why don't you and I...
- No.

01:52:24.571 --> 01:52:27.165
Robert, no words. On your knees.

01:52:27.699 --> 01:52:29.076
Do it.

01:52:29.159 --> 01:52:30.786
No, I mean it. Down.

01:52:31.828 --> 01:52:34.672
Not you. No, my dear, you.

01:52:37.292 --> 01:52:39.386
You're my miracle, Sophie.

01:52:40.337 --> 01:52:42.806
You're the guardian of the Grail.

01:52:43.799 --> 01:52:47.429
All the oppression of the poor
and the powerless

01:52:47.511 --> 01:52:50.481
of those of different skin, of women.

01:52:50.555 --> 01:52:53.274
You can put an end to all that.

01:52:54.017 --> 01:52:57.191
You must explode the truth onto the world.

01:52:58.522 --> 01:52:59.990
It's your duty.

01:53:02.901 --> 01:53:05.324
You know the answer to this riddle.

01:53:07.114 --> 01:53:08.707
Open the cryptex,

01:53:10.242 --> 01:53:11.960
and I'll put down the gun.

01:53:30.095 --> 01:53:32.189
I have no idea how.

01:53:32.264 --> 01:53:34.266
I don't know the code.

01:53:34.349 --> 01:53:36.898
And even if I did, I wouldn't tell you.

01:53:42.649 --> 01:53:44.572
Like your grandfather, then.

01:53:45.694 --> 01:53:48.197
Willing to die for your secret.

01:53:49.865 --> 01:53:52.789
But, by the way
you've been looking at your hero,

01:53:53.577 --> 01:53:57.923
I wonder, would you let him die for you?

01:53:58.623 --> 01:54:01.001
Open it, Sophie, to save his life.

01:54:01.084 --> 01:54:03.257
- Leigh, you can't just...
- Open the cryptex.

01:54:03.920 --> 01:54:05.012
I don't know how.

01:54:05.088 --> 01:54:07.136
Open it or he dies.

01:54:07.215 --> 01:54:09.309
- I swear, I don't know.
- Do it! Do it!

01:54:09.384 --> 01:54:10.681
- Stop it!
- I don't know!

01:54:10.761 --> 01:54:12.104
Stop it!

01:54:17.934 --> 01:54:19.936
She can't do it, Leigh.

01:54:31.656 --> 01:54:33.533
But give... Give me a moment.

01:54:43.710 --> 01:54:45.087
Robert.

01:54:58.642 --> 01:54:59.689
What are you doing?

01:55:00.394 --> 01:55:01.566
Please.

01:56:21.766 --> 01:56:23.234
I'm sorry.

01:56:33.403 --> 01:56:34.575
I'm sorry.

01:56:37.365 --> 01:56:38.366
No!

01:56:46.917 --> 01:56:48.260
No, Robert!

01:56:49.002 --> 01:56:50.254
No!

01:56:51.421 --> 01:56:52.422
No.

01:56:52.714 --> 01:56:54.933
The map. It's ruined.

01:57:02.432 --> 01:57:03.900
The map is ruined.

01:57:04.893 --> 01:57:06.236
The Grail.

01:57:06.728 --> 01:57:07.854
It's lost.

01:57:08.563 --> 01:57:10.031
The Grail is gone.

01:57:10.398 --> 01:57:13.117
Only the worthy find the Grail, Leigh.

01:57:14.236 --> 01:57:15.783
You taught me that.

01:57:18.990 --> 01:57:20.537
Armed police!

01:57:20.617 --> 01:57:22.119
Drop it! Drop your weapon!

01:57:23.286 --> 01:57:24.333
Put the gun down.

01:57:27.415 --> 01:57:29.759
Put the gun down.

01:57:34.506 --> 01:57:37.476
That one. The old man.

01:57:37.551 --> 01:57:38.552
You're under arrest!

01:57:38.635 --> 01:57:41.013
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defense

01:57:41.096 --> 01:57:43.098
if you do not mention, when questioned

01:57:43.181 --> 01:57:45.309
something which you later rely on in court.

01:57:45.392 --> 01:57:48.111
Anything you do say
will be given in evidence.

01:57:58.738 --> 01:58:01.036
I'll have some questions for you.

01:58:18.675 --> 01:58:20.723
Robert! Robert!

01:58:20.802 --> 01:58:22.645
Robert! How could you do it?

01:58:22.721 --> 01:58:24.598
How could you? Robert!

01:58:25.265 --> 01:58:27.609
To destroy our hope of freedom.

01:58:27.976 --> 01:58:31.571
To deny every pilgrim the chance
to kneel at the tomb of the Magdalene.

01:58:31.646 --> 01:58:32.647
How could you?

01:58:37.360 --> 01:58:39.328
You couldn't! You solved it.

01:58:41.781 --> 01:58:45.251
You took the scroll out before it broke!

01:58:45.660 --> 01:58:47.913
You solved it. You'll find it, Robert.

01:58:47.996 --> 01:58:49.623
You'll find it. You know what to do.

01:58:49.706 --> 01:58:51.959
You'll find the Grail,
you'll kneel before her,

01:58:52.042 --> 01:58:54.136
and you'll set her free upon the world!

01:58:54.210 --> 01:58:57.339
That man there,
he's got the map to the Holy Grail!

01:59:08.224 --> 01:59:12.730
There was every orb conceivable
on that tomb except one.

01:59:14.022 --> 01:59:16.366
The orb which fell from the heavens

01:59:16.441 --> 01:59:18.114
and inspired Newton's life's work.

01:59:18.193 --> 01:59:23.290
Work that incurred the wrath
of the Church until his dying day.

01:59:26.576 --> 01:59:28.044
A-P-P-L-E.

01:59:29.079 --> 01:59:30.296
Apple.

01:59:44.928 --> 01:59:48.023
"The Holy Grail 'neath ancient Roslin waits.

01:59:48.098 --> 01:59:50.476
"The blade and chalice
guarding o'er Her gates

01:59:50.558 --> 01:59:52.526
"Adorned in masters' loving art, She lies

01:59:52.602 --> 01:59:56.357
"She rests at last beneath the starry skies"

01:59:58.441 --> 02:00:00.409
I think I know where she's gone.

02:00:01.277 --> 02:00:03.780
I think the Grail has gone home.

02:00:23.675 --> 02:00:26.178
Built by the Templars themselves.

02:00:26.261 --> 02:00:28.605
Named for the original Rose Line.

02:00:28.680 --> 02:00:30.557
Rosslyn Chapel.

02:00:31.725 --> 02:00:33.477
So this is it.

02:00:34.477 --> 02:00:36.354
The gift at the end.

02:00:37.313 --> 02:00:41.068
"The Holy Grail 'neath ancient Roslin waits."

02:00:41.985 --> 02:00:44.784
You never told me the joke
Saunière made of you.

02:00:45.488 --> 02:00:47.161
What was it?

02:00:47.240 --> 02:00:49.459
He called me a flatfoot.

02:00:49.534 --> 02:00:51.457
A beat cop of history.

02:00:52.537 --> 02:00:54.164
A dumb policeman,

02:00:54.831 --> 02:00:58.335
who just does his job
day after day, of history.

02:00:58.418 --> 02:01:00.136
You know, his father was one.

02:01:00.837 --> 02:01:02.760
A policeman.

02:01:02.839 --> 02:01:07.561
Saunière said he was the most
honorable man he had ever known.

02:01:11.431 --> 02:01:14.105
We are who we protect, I think.

02:01:14.976 --> 02:01:16.694
What we stand up for.

02:01:28.698 --> 02:01:30.075
Jewish.

02:01:31.201 --> 02:01:33.920
Christian, Egyptian.

02:01:35.205 --> 02:01:37.628
Masonic, pagan.

02:01:38.708 --> 02:01:40.426
Templar crosses.

02:01:41.044 --> 02:01:42.421
Pyramids.

02:01:43.171 --> 02:01:47.051
I think I've been here before.

02:01:47.133 --> 02:01:48.350
Sophie?

02:02:08.154 --> 02:02:09.872
A very long time ago.

02:02:12.242 --> 02:02:14.085
Come along, Sophie.

02:02:29.259 --> 02:02:30.306
Sophie.

02:02:31.344 --> 02:02:32.470
Over here.

02:02:40.228 --> 02:02:43.778
"The blade and chalice
guarding o'er Her gates."

02:02:44.274 --> 02:02:46.777
Pagan symbols for male and female.

02:02:48.611 --> 02:02:50.739
Fused as one.

02:02:50.822 --> 02:02:52.950
As the pagans would have wanted.

02:02:54.701 --> 02:02:56.419
We're about to close, I'm afraid.

02:03:02.667 --> 02:03:05.011
We're just gonna be a moment.

02:03:19.851 --> 02:03:21.148
Robert.

02:03:47.253 --> 02:03:50.427
"Adorned in masters' loving art, she lies."

02:03:50.506 --> 02:03:55.933
"She rests at last beneath the starry skies."

02:04:15.531 --> 02:04:17.204
The fleur-de-lis.

02:05:08.292 --> 02:05:09.384
She was here.

02:05:12.422 --> 02:05:13.969
Her sarcophagus.

02:05:16.050 --> 02:05:17.643
Mary Magdalene.

02:05:19.429 --> 02:05:21.352
The Holy Grail herself.

02:05:23.016 --> 02:05:24.643
She was here.

02:05:24.726 --> 02:05:26.353
Where did she go?

02:05:27.437 --> 02:05:29.815
Did the Church finally get her?

02:05:44.328 --> 02:05:47.047
This is incredible. Look at this.

02:05:47.123 --> 02:05:50.468
Look at this.
These records go back thousands of years.

02:05:51.627 --> 02:05:54.130
They date back to the death of Christ.

02:05:56.799 --> 02:06:00.144
Good God, could these
really be the Grail documents?

02:06:22.200 --> 02:06:26.080
What did he want from us?
To find her sarcophagus?

02:06:27.580 --> 02:06:30.254
How was I ever supposed to
figure all this out?

02:06:30.625 --> 02:06:33.003
When you and your grandfather fought,

02:06:33.086 --> 02:06:35.805
was it something about your past?

02:06:37.757 --> 02:06:39.509
How could you know that?

02:06:40.176 --> 02:06:42.895
About how your parents died?

02:06:43.971 --> 02:06:45.518
Sophie?

02:06:47.892 --> 02:06:50.145
It was during primary school.

02:06:51.729 --> 02:06:53.731
I was in his library.

02:06:55.525 --> 02:06:57.198
Doing research.

02:06:57.276 --> 02:06:59.904
I was trying to find out about my family.

02:07:00.071 --> 02:07:02.369
Sophie, where are you, princess?

02:07:03.157 --> 02:07:05.455
I wanted to know about them.

02:07:06.244 --> 02:07:08.212
But I couldn't find any records.

02:07:09.330 --> 02:07:11.207
Not of their death,

02:07:12.708 --> 02:07:14.460
not of the accident.

02:07:15.419 --> 02:07:17.922
I'd asked him for as long
as I could remember,

02:07:18.005 --> 02:07:19.177
but he would never tell me.

02:07:19.257 --> 02:07:20.975
I told you, no.

02:07:23.386 --> 02:07:24.888
But why can't I?

02:07:25.221 --> 02:07:27.064
He stood over me,

02:07:28.766 --> 02:07:30.814
and he wouldn't let me leave.

02:07:31.018 --> 02:07:32.861
They're dead. Dead and buried.

02:07:33.354 --> 02:07:35.027
Never look for them, Sophie.

02:07:35.273 --> 02:07:36.490
Promise me.

02:07:37.942 --> 02:07:39.068
Swear it!

02:07:39.777 --> 02:07:40.903
Swear it to me!

02:07:51.581 --> 02:07:53.549
I kept my promise.

02:07:57.170 --> 02:07:59.468
The next week he sent me to boarding school.

02:08:01.674 --> 02:08:04.644
One weekend, I came home unexpectedly.

02:08:06.262 --> 02:08:08.356
And what I saw my grandfather doing...

02:08:09.974 --> 02:08:11.601
Some ritual.

02:08:13.603 --> 02:08:15.196
I was so frightened.

02:08:19.859 --> 02:08:22.032
We hardly ever spoke again.

02:08:25.656 --> 02:08:27.283
Do you have any...

02:08:28.075 --> 02:08:30.794
Any memories of your grandfather
before the accident?

02:08:31.871 --> 02:08:33.623
Before your parents were killed?

02:08:34.707 --> 02:08:37.301
Yeah. No, I don't know.

02:08:38.461 --> 02:08:39.633
Why?

02:08:42.381 --> 02:08:44.759
Because I don't think
he was your grandfather.

02:09:04.237 --> 02:09:05.955
These are my parents.

02:09:08.241 --> 02:09:09.584
My brother.

02:09:11.410 --> 02:09:13.208
And this is you, isn't it?

02:09:18.167 --> 02:09:21.842
The paper says the entire family was killed.

02:09:22.338 --> 02:09:25.683
The mother, the father, the boy, six.

02:09:27.927 --> 02:09:30.146
And the girl, four.

02:09:31.847 --> 02:09:34.942
But your name was never Saunière.

02:09:35.017 --> 02:09:36.564
It's Saint-Clair.

02:09:39.939 --> 02:09:42.283
It's one of the oldest families in France.

02:09:42.942 --> 02:09:46.196
It's from a line of the Merovingian kings.

02:09:55.288 --> 02:09:57.086
Royal blood.

02:09:59.125 --> 02:10:00.718
I was so wrong.

02:10:02.378 --> 02:10:06.679
Saunière didn't want you
to help guard the secret of the Holy Grail.

02:10:08.384 --> 02:10:09.727
Sophie,

02:10:12.221 --> 02:10:14.064
you are the secret.

02:10:15.725 --> 02:10:17.648
You survived the accident.

02:10:18.477 --> 02:10:21.230
If it even was an accident.

02:10:21.314 --> 02:10:23.237
The Priory found out.

02:10:23.899 --> 02:10:27.073
Somehow they concealed the fact
that you were alive.

02:10:27.611 --> 02:10:30.581
They hid you with the Grand Master himself,

02:10:31.490 --> 02:10:33.458
who raised you as his own.

02:10:34.744 --> 02:10:36.542
According to all of this,

02:10:37.997 --> 02:10:39.749
Princess Sophie,

02:10:43.461 --> 02:10:45.088
you are the heir.

02:10:47.131 --> 02:10:49.225
The end of the bloodline.

02:10:50.801 --> 02:10:53.850
You are the last living descendent

02:10:55.181 --> 02:10:57.024
of Jesus Christ.

02:11:42.561 --> 02:11:43.938
What is this?

02:11:45.981 --> 02:11:47.198
Sophie?

02:11:50.444 --> 02:11:51.570
Who are you?

02:11:51.654 --> 02:11:54.624
There have been many names.

02:11:54.698 --> 02:11:56.325
The keepers.

02:11:57.368 --> 02:11:59.166
Guardians.

02:11:59.245 --> 02:12:01.794
The Priory of Sion.

02:12:01.872 --> 02:12:06.924
But to you, Sophie, we are friends
of the man who raised you,

02:12:07.586 --> 02:12:09.179
Jacques Saunière.

02:12:11.590 --> 02:12:14.309
He would have wanted you to know

02:12:14.385 --> 02:12:16.888
that he loved you very much.

02:12:17.930 --> 02:12:22.026
And that the Priory are here
to protect you now

02:12:22.101 --> 02:12:25.275
as they have always protected our family.

02:12:27.857 --> 02:12:29.951
I gave you up once

02:12:30.734 --> 02:12:33.533
knowing I might never see you again.

02:12:37.241 --> 02:12:39.164
I'm your grandmother, Sophie.

02:12:40.286 --> 02:12:43.711
I have prayed for this moment

02:12:43.789 --> 02:12:45.666
for a very long time.

02:12:47.293 --> 02:12:49.421
Welcome home, child.

02:13:02.266 --> 02:13:03.483
Hey.

02:13:13.819 --> 02:13:17.665
She has some things she wants to tell me.

02:13:18.657 --> 02:13:21.035
About my family.

02:13:27.541 --> 02:13:28.758
What will you do?

02:13:29.919 --> 02:13:33.423
The legend will be revealed
when the heir reveals himself.

02:13:34.256 --> 02:13:36.759
They just got the pronoun wrong.

02:13:40.179 --> 02:13:41.806
She said when Saunière died

02:13:41.889 --> 02:13:44.688
he took the location
of Mary's sarcophagus with him.

02:13:44.767 --> 02:13:49.398
So there's no way to empirically prove
that I am related to her.

02:13:52.149 --> 02:13:54.117
What would you do, Robert?

02:13:55.069 --> 02:13:57.288
Okay, maybe there is no proof.

02:13:57.363 --> 02:13:59.536
Maybe the Grail is lost forever.

02:13:59.615 --> 02:14:03.336
But, Sophie, the only thing that matters
is what you believe.

02:14:04.745 --> 02:14:07.874
History shows us
Jesus was an extraordinary man.

02:14:07.957 --> 02:14:09.959
A human inspiration. That's it.

02:14:10.834 --> 02:14:13.553
That's all the evidence has ever proved.

02:14:15.005 --> 02:14:16.131
But...

02:14:17.091 --> 02:14:18.968
When I was a boy...

02:14:21.303 --> 02:14:25.183
When I was down in that well
Teabing told you about,

02:14:28.519 --> 02:14:30.988
I thought I was going to die, Sophie.

02:14:33.107 --> 02:14:35.235
What I did,

02:14:35.317 --> 02:14:36.694
I prayed.

02:14:38.028 --> 02:14:39.621
I prayed

02:14:39.697 --> 02:14:42.667
to Jesus to keep me alive,

02:14:42.741 --> 02:14:44.288
so I could see my parents again,

02:14:44.368 --> 02:14:46.462
so I could go to school again,

02:14:47.496 --> 02:14:49.749
so I could play with my dog.

02:14:51.125 --> 02:14:54.129
Sometimes I wonder
if I wasn't alone down there.

02:14:56.338 --> 02:14:59.182
Why does it have to be human or divine?

02:14:59.258 --> 02:15:01.181
Maybe human is divine.

02:15:02.469 --> 02:15:04.142
Why couldn't Jesus have been a father

02:15:04.221 --> 02:15:07.020
and still been capable of all those miracles?

02:15:07.683 --> 02:15:10.482
Like turning water into wine?

02:15:10.561 --> 02:15:13.690
Well, who knows? His blood is your blood.

02:15:14.523 --> 02:15:17.618
Maybe that junkie in the park
will never touch a drug again.

02:15:18.193 --> 02:15:21.322
Maybe you healed my phobia with your hands.

02:15:21.405 --> 02:15:24.409
And maybe you're a knight on a Grail quest.

02:15:27.244 --> 02:15:29.793
Well, here's the question.

02:15:30.664 --> 02:15:33.383
A living descendent of Jesus Christ,

02:15:34.918 --> 02:15:37.467
would she destroy faith?

02:15:38.005 --> 02:15:40.884
Or would she renew it?

02:15:43.552 --> 02:15:46.726
So again I say,
what matters is what you believe.

02:15:49.058 --> 02:15:50.355
Thank you.

02:15:52.519 --> 02:15:53.736
For bringing me here.

02:15:55.773 --> 02:15:58.276
For letting him choose you,

02:15:59.151 --> 02:16:00.368
Sir Robert.

02:16:10.621 --> 02:16:11.622
You take care.

02:16:13.207 --> 02:16:14.333
Yes.

02:16:38.941 --> 02:16:40.112
Hey.

02:16:53.121 --> 02:16:54.123
Nope.

02:16:55.457 --> 02:16:57.709
Maybe I'll do better with the wine.

02:17:01.129 --> 02:17:02.507
Godspeed.

02:18:01.397 --> 02:18:02.775
Bloodline.

02:18:06.195 --> 02:18:07.538
Rose Line.

02:18:14.327 --> 02:18:16.376
"Hides beneath the Rose."

02:19:07.923 --> 02:19:11.518
"The Holy Grail 'neath ancient Roslin waits.

02:19:14.680 --> 02:19:18.105
"Adorned in masters' loving art, She lies.

02:19:34.241 --> 02:19:37.870
"The blade and chalice
guarding o'er Her gates.

02:20:17.326 --> 02:20:20.830
"She rests at last beneath starry skies."
