There are 14,000 serving officers
in the NSW force,

00:21.480 --> 00:23.240
not all of them are corrupt,

00:23.240 --> 00:25.240
but there are plenty
of shitheads who are.

00:25.240 --> 00:27.960
And they're clever, sneaky shitheads

00:27.960 --> 00:31.120
who will close ranks
at the first whiff of a leak

00:31.120 --> 00:33.920

just to fess up.

00:33.920 --> 00:36.600
The only way to do our job,
expose corruption,

00:36.600 --> 00:39.480
is get someone on the inside.

the temperature was rising.

You know him?

Yeah, low-level Kings Cross dirtbag.

02:23.780 --> 02:26.220
A bloody lucky dirtbag.

02:26.220 --> 02:29.380

02:29.380 --> 02:31.900
She says he tripped.

But judging by the distance
from the balcony to where he hit,

02:35.380 --> 02:36.940

if he's got any enemies?

You too.

Mmm.

Hi, Eddie.

Hey, um, that's from Benny Kassab.

02:59.620 --> 03:01.940
So, they're chucking blokes
off balconies now.

03:01.940 --> 03:04.860

tense up here in the Cross, Trev.

are getting a bit restless.

A bigger nobody
you could not hope to find.

03:14.780 --> 03:16.860
Well, maybe it's not about Ludlow.

03:16.860 --> 03:19.055
Maybe someone's
sending out a message.

Shocking. Poor bastard.

he can go fuck himself.

You know Ludlow used to be my fizz.

getting a little bit paranoia.

was no bodies.

I will enforce that rule

over about a month ago?

07:32.300 --> 07:35.420
Yeah, the pair of dumb shitheads may
as well have left their calling card.

07:35.420 --> 07:40.100
Well, it seems that Ludlow was
fencing the proceeds from that job

07:40.100 --> 07:43.140
and the word is...
is he dogged 'em.

07:43.140 --> 07:46.500
No-one dogged 'em. We had the rego
of the getaway car, for Christ's sake.

07:46.500 --> 07:50.260
Yeah, still, Trev,
Ludlow was your fizz, right?

07:50.260 --> 07:52.020
And then you pinch
the correct shitheads

Ludlow's broken back is my fault?

07:59.220 --> 08:00.940
No, mate.

Trev, all I'm saying is that Louis
Bayeh has nothing to do with it, OK?

08:04.620 --> 08:06.690
It's just a pure coincidence.

is to catch your man, Hollingsworth!

against him.

Oh, you wouldn't.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.260
It was a long time ago.

10:26.260 --> 10:29.218
(MEN CHEER)

10:31.500 --> 10:33.013
But I remember you.

10:41.100 --> 10:42.580
Hey, Kim.

10:42.580 --> 10:44.220
That party I saw you at,

10:44.220 --> 10:46.500
you probably remember
which one it was, huh?

10:46.500 --> 10:49.740
Ah, it might have been
one of my shows.

10:49.740 --> 10:51.300
Dobroyd Point.

10:51.300 --> 10:54.140
You and two of your friends.

10:54.140 --> 10:56.460
Pretty hard to forget that one.

10:56.460 --> 11:00.020
Yeah, I'm not doing anything
like that anymore.

11:00.020 --> 11:02.540
Look, I'm not gonna give you
a hard time about it.

11:02.540 --> 11:04.690
In fact, I wanna make you
a proposition.

11:05.980 --> 11:07.060
Right.

11:07.060 --> 11:10.260
See, I met a couple of blokes
out here, detectives,

11:10.260 --> 11:13.696
and we're thinking of going
into business for ourselves.

11:16.740 --> 11:18.571
Your old business.

11:20.540 --> 11:24.580
Yeah, like I said, sir, I'm not
doing anything like that anymore.

11:24.580 --> 11:27.180
Look, I'm not asking
you to hook, yeah?

11:27.180 --> 11:29.540
We're planning on
remaining silent partners.

11:29.540 --> 11:32.220
We just need someone
to look after the joint,

11:32.220 --> 11:34.688
do the books, manage the girls.

11:36.180 --> 11:38.011
Just have a think about it, alright?

11:43.140 --> 11:46.371
You're starting out
on a new career here now...

11:47.540 --> 11:50.020
...and it's important
to make friends,

11:50.020 --> 11:54.900
otherwise you might just
take off on the wrong foot.

11:54.900 --> 11:56.856
You wouldn't want that.

11:58.300 --> 11:59.733
No.

12:37.820 --> 12:39.253
Trevor?

12:50.740 --> 12:52.340
What on earth are you doing?

12:52.340 --> 12:55.300
Have you had a locksmith in today?
Sorry?

12:55.300 --> 12:57.860
You know, did you lock yourself
out of the house or something?

12:57.860 --> 13:01.980
What are you on about?
Nothing. Forget about it.

13:01.980 --> 13:05.177
Well, then, why are you doing that?
I said forget about it.

13:12.420 --> 13:14.980
So you still reckon I just need
to let off some steam?

13:14.980 --> 13:17.060
So, the barrels on your locks
were loose, mate.

13:17.060 --> 13:18.660
It's called wear and tear, Trev.

13:18.660 --> 13:20.700
Chook, I could see
the scratches on them.

13:20.700 --> 13:23.260
I'm telling you,
someone's been in my house.

13:27.180 --> 13:30.420
Your phone will be off, then.
Not just my phone!

13:30.420 --> 13:32.300
This means the commission's on to me!

13:32.300 --> 13:34.500
Yeah, alright, mate. Calm down, eh?

13:34.500 --> 13:36.500
We're all a bit hot right now.
No point...

13:36.500 --> 13:38.380
Yeah, but who's got
the most to lose, eh?

13:38.380 --> 13:40.820
I've been at the sharp end
of this thing for two years.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.300
No!

13:42.300 --> 13:44.609
We are in this together.

13:45.740 --> 13:49.620
If we just keep our mouths shut
and keep our heads down,

13:49.620 --> 13:52.660
then there's no way any of us
are gonna go down.

13:52.660 --> 13:54.378
Alright?

14:01.300 --> 14:05.020
Now, look, we'll just keep this
between us, yeah?

14:05.020 --> 14:08.137
There's no point
making the other boys nervous.

14:09.420 --> 14:10.900
OK?

14:10.900 --> 14:13.289
Kath. Another one, please, love.

14:20.040 --> 14:22.400
Yeah, Benny, you can't trust no-one.

14:22.400 --> 14:26.840
He's a good boy, like my brother,
but... I don't know.

14:26.840 --> 14:29.229
Too much cocaine fucked his head up.

14:30.480 --> 14:33.160
This coming from Mr Clean, huh?

14:33.160 --> 14:35.480
There's no drugs in me, Benny.
Ah.

14:35.480 --> 14:37.160
It's me.

14:37.160 --> 14:38.640
I go crazy.

14:38.640 --> 14:41.600
But, brother, the steroids.
You gotta relax, mate.

14:41.600 --> 14:45.800
Listen to me, Benny, my mind
is clear, clear like a bell.

14:45.800 --> 14:47.120

14:47.120 --> 14:49.520

14:49.520 --> 14:52.200
Yo.
Yeah, it's Kermit here.

14:52.200 --> 14:54.760
How are we looking, Kermit?
Your next payment's due.

14:54.760 --> 14:56.600
No, no, no. No, wait a second!

14:56.600 --> 14:59.560
I already told you there's been
talks of raids, Trevor.

14:59.560 --> 15:01.040
Trevor? Who the fuck's Trevor?

15:01.040 --> 15:02.760
OK.

15:02.760 --> 15:04.440
Kermit.

15:04.440 --> 15:06.960
Trust me, if there are raids,
you'll know about them.

15:06.960 --> 15:09.240
Get your wallet out.
I'll call you when we're good.

15:09.240 --> 15:12.080
Bloody Haken,
he tells me it's all good

15:12.080 --> 15:15.640
but I don't even think
that prick even knows, mate.

15:15.640 --> 15:17.400
Why you even pay this idiot?

15:17.400 --> 15:19.440
It's like I got all
these leeches, brother.

15:19.440 --> 15:23.400
Leech? Burn him with a cigarette.
(LAUGHS)

15:23.400 --> 15:25.960
Burn that bitch.
(LAUGHS)

15:27.480 --> 15:29.040
JIM: This is a turnout.

15:29.040 --> 15:31.760
It's one of the few places left
you can be sure no-one's listening.

15:31.760 --> 15:34.240
Apart from the obvious. (LAUGHS)

15:34.240 --> 15:36.200
Tell me, Jimbo,
you had any dodgy phone chats

15:36.200 --> 15:37.960
with your mate Benny Kassab lately?

15:37.960 --> 15:40.428
How lately?
Just answer the fucking question.

15:42.040 --> 15:44.800
No. Not for a while.

15:44.800 --> 15:47.200
Trev's been handling all that.

15:47.200 --> 15:50.640
Alright, word is
the royal commission has a tape

15:50.640 --> 15:53.640
of a senior detective
talking to Benny Kassab.

15:53.640 --> 15:55.840
Apparently it's red-hot
and they're about to move on it.

15:55.840 --> 15:58.200
You told Trev about it?
No.

15:58.200 --> 16:01.440
And you be careful
before you go near him.

16:01.440 --> 16:03.640
They're gonna be all over
the poor bugger.

16:03.640 --> 16:07.155
Well, how do I fix it?
No fixing this one.

16:08.960 --> 16:10.632
Time for some damage control, yeah?

16:12.320 --> 16:13.753
OK.

16:23.160 --> 16:26.040
Oi! What's in your belt?
What?

16:26.040 --> 16:28.400
I have reason to believe
that you have a concealed weapon.

16:28.400 --> 16:30.560
Up against the wall, legs apart.

16:30.560 --> 16:32.240
Hey! Get him back, keep him back.

16:32.240 --> 16:33.880
Are you pulling my dick now or what?

16:33.880 --> 16:35.359
I'm not pulling
your fucking dick, OK?

16:37.560 --> 16:40.040
Someone close to you
is dogging, Benny.

16:40.040 --> 16:41.160
What?

16:41.160 --> 16:45.720
I said a little birdie says
that your phone's off

16:45.720 --> 16:48.040
and the Commissioner
is about to move on you.

16:48.040 --> 16:50.080
Hey, you're sure?
Sure?

16:50.080 --> 16:53.840
The bloke I got this from
does not fuck around, OK?

16:53.840 --> 16:56.760
Now, if you're smart,
you won't either.

16:56.760 --> 16:58.240
Yeah, I got it. Piss off.

16:58.240 --> 16:59.280
Got it?
Yeah.

16:59.280 --> 17:01.800
Alright, nothing to see.
Move on, move back.

17:01.800 --> 17:03.199
On your way, mate.

17:05.319 --> 17:07.920
NARRATOR: Benny promised himself
he'd find the traitor in his team

17:07.920 --> 17:09.480
before it was too late,

17:09.480 --> 17:11.310
and he suspected everyone.

17:22.319 --> 17:25.073
Paranoia can be like
a contagious disease.

17:43.480 --> 17:45.600
(GRUNTS) Fuck!

17:45.600 --> 17:47.600
You and Monica, you in it together?
Hey?

17:47.600 --> 17:49.200
What, you two selling me for money?

17:49.200 --> 17:52.240
Or you just wanna get rid of me
so you can keep screwing her, Donny?!

17:52.240 --> 17:54.000
Oh, no, Benny, I'm not...

17:54.000 --> 17:56.600
Yeah, don't shit me, Don!
Huh? She's been calling you, mate.

17:56.600 --> 17:59.400
I looked at the times...
always when I'm working late.

17:59.400 --> 18:01.680
She just wants to know
what time you're coming home.

18:01.680 --> 18:03.480
Bullshit!
I swear, mate.

18:03.480 --> 18:06.199
She doesn't wanna be nagging you
so she rings me,

18:07.280 --> 18:08.713
I swear, Benny.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.520
OK.

18:11.520 --> 18:12.999
OK. Fuck!

18:15.320 --> 18:18.720
Everything cool down here?
Yeah, fine, mate.

18:18.720 --> 18:21.280
(PANTS) Fine.

18:21.280 --> 18:23.320
I got all the stuff
from last night sorted.

18:23.320 --> 18:25.760

18:31.680 --> 18:34.800
Hey, that's good, man.
No, that's good.

18:34.800 --> 18:36.233
Benny.

18:38.320 --> 18:41.596
About last week, man, I'm sorry.

18:42.720 --> 18:45.120
You're my best mate, man.
It's cool, man.

18:45.120 --> 18:47.440

I got down here, man.

18:47.440 --> 18:49.908

18:54.560 --> 18:58.640
Listen, if I had to leave now,

18:58.640 --> 19:02.680
like, go away overseas
for a very long time,

19:02.680 --> 19:05.148
would you come with me?

19:08.040 --> 19:09.871
Do you want me to come with you?

19:11.720 --> 19:13.320
Yeah, I do.

19:13.320 --> 19:17.074

OK.

NARRATOR: Convinced his best mate,
Norm, had dogged him,

19:24.200 --> 19:26.960
Benny decided to get out
while the going was good.

19:26.960 --> 19:29.880
He figured the US was
as good a place as any to lie low.

do you know a Benjamin Kassab?

20:40.780 --> 20:43.860
Shit, I've already
answered questions about this.

20:43.860 --> 20:45.780
That was police Internal Affairs.

20:45.780 --> 20:48.897
As you know, we're not with
the NSW Police.

20:51.180 --> 20:52.700
Yes, I know him.

20:52.700 --> 20:55.380
GERRY: What is the nature of
your relationship with Mr Kassab?

20:55.380 --> 20:59.060
He's my fizz,
a registered informant.

20:59.060 --> 21:02.020
Conveniently registered
on 15 August, 1993...

21:02.020 --> 21:05.420
a day after you became aware of
the Internal Affairs investigation.

21:05.420 --> 21:08.500
I don't recall the exact date,
but if you say so.

21:08.500 --> 21:11.260
Have you ever accepted money
from Mr Kassab?

21:11.260 --> 21:12.420
Never.

21:12.420 --> 21:14.700
No gifts or payments of any kind,

21:14.700 --> 21:16.980
on behalf of yourself
or any other person?

21:16.980 --> 21:18.300
Never.

21:18.300 --> 21:20.980
Detective Sergeant Haken,
I put it to you

21:20.980 --> 21:23.820
that your relationship
with Mr Kassab is corrupt.

21:23.820 --> 21:26.060
And that money has changed hands...
No.

21:26.060 --> 21:28.580
...and that money has
changed hands regularly

21:28.580 --> 21:30.740
for the past six to eight months.

21:30.740 --> 21:32.740
And I'm denying it.

21:32.740 --> 21:35.900
Now, the reason
why I was at home, off work,

21:35.900 --> 21:38.180
is that I have a blinding migraine.

21:38.180 --> 21:41.540

something new to add to this,

Amongst others.

27:01.060 --> 27:03.140
Mate, you wanna be real careful.

27:03.140 --> 27:06.300
That lot there...
he's top of the list.

27:06.300 --> 27:08.940
Mate, I'm not planning
on doing anything for Bayeh.

27:08.940 --> 27:12.580
The stupid bastard's
palming money at me hand over fist.

27:12.580 --> 27:14.298
All I'm doing is counting it.

27:15.740 --> 27:19.449
Smart move, Eddie, real smart move.
Thanks, Jimbo.

27:22.660 --> 27:23.820
What's up?

27:23.820 --> 27:25.860
Mr Bayeh wants to
talk to you urgent.

27:25.860 --> 27:27.293
I'm on duty.

27:31.180 --> 27:33.011
(PAPER CRINKLES)
(WHISPERS) Urgent.

27:36.380 --> 27:38.260
Oh, shit!
Detective.

27:38.260 --> 27:41.620
Did I run over your foot?
No, I'm fine.

27:41.620 --> 27:43.660
How you doing, Marty?

27:43.660 --> 27:47.340
Well, I piss in a bag,
shit in a bag, can't get hard,

27:47.340 --> 27:49.660
or if I do, I don't know about it.

27:49.660 --> 27:51.380
(SCREAMS)

27:51.380 --> 27:53.980
You know Big Tommy,
used to be Tommy Gould?

27:53.980 --> 27:55.700
Detective Gould's brother?
Yeah.

27:55.700 --> 27:58.660
Well, I was sort of dropping in
on his missus for a bit,

27:58.660 --> 28:01.379
but I guess he kind of took it bad.

28:14.620 --> 28:16.780
Good to see you, matey.
You too.

28:16.780 --> 28:18.380
Shit, eh?
Mmm.

28:18.380 --> 28:19.699
Ouch.

28:21.180 --> 28:23.540
Hey, I learnt my lesson.

28:23.540 --> 28:25.098
Just too late.

28:28.620 --> 28:30.580
EDDIE ON PHONE:
So will you be there?

28:30.580 --> 28:34.060
Um, it's not that
I... I don't wanna do it,

28:34.060 --> 28:37.660
it's just that I'm really busy here
with my classes and everything...

28:37.660 --> 28:39.220
All I'm asking you to do

28:39.220 --> 28:41.940
is to come and have a look
at the premises that we've picked.

28:41.940 --> 28:44.540
It's just an empty bloody building.
Yeah, I know.

28:44.540 --> 28:48.220
It's just that I'm not involved
in that world anymore.

28:48.220 --> 28:51.420
Look, I'm a detective sergeant,

28:51.420 --> 28:54.380
some of my partners
are even higher up,

28:54.380 --> 28:56.660
so, why don't you
just let us worry about

28:56.660 --> 28:58.457
the wrongs and rights of this, eh?

29:18.380 --> 29:20.336
They've served me.

29:22.020 --> 29:25.057
S. 7... ordered to testify
at the commission.

29:26.460 --> 29:28.220
The boys find out about this,

29:28.220 --> 29:29.820
they're gonna be
shitting themselves.

29:29.820 --> 29:32.060
Oh, mate, if they can't trust you...

29:32.060 --> 29:34.700
Oh, mate, it's not about
whether they can trust me.

29:34.700 --> 29:38.220
I mean, the first bloke up's in
a bit of a bloody spot, isn't he?

29:38.220 --> 29:40.060
We'll all be up there eventually.
Yeah.

29:40.060 --> 29:44.060
But the first bloke, say,
he says it's all bullshit, right?

29:44.060 --> 29:45.700
"There's no corruption down here,
Your Honour."

29:45.700 --> 29:48.260
If even one of the pricks
that comes after him

29:48.260 --> 29:49.900
cracks and spills his guts,

29:49.900 --> 29:52.500
they'll lock the first bloke up
on perjury,

29:52.500 --> 29:55.219
even if they can't prove
he ever took a cent.

29:56.700 --> 29:59.612
We've been through a lot of shit
together, you and me, Trevor.

30:01.580 --> 30:03.536
You know my wife...

30:04.900 --> 30:06.620
...my kids.

30:06.620 --> 30:08.656
What are you getting at, Chook?

30:12.260 --> 30:14.860
I want you to look me in the eye

30:14.860 --> 30:17.860
and swear that
when you get on that stand,

30:17.860 --> 30:20.499
you will not make me a liar.

30:23.260 --> 30:25.100
I wouldn't do that.

30:25.100 --> 30:26.533
We're mates.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.093
Good.

30:33.300 --> 30:35.530
Now, let's go and
knock some heads together.

30:37.980 --> 30:39.460
Thanks, Kath.

30:39.460 --> 30:42.620
I mean, you know how many bloody
investigations I've seen down here?

30:42.620 --> 30:45.220
SCULLY: A lot.
A fucking lot.

30:45.220 --> 30:47.820
And the only reason
anyone ever goes down,

30:47.820 --> 30:51.380
is because some bloody idiot
opens his mouth.

30:51.380 --> 30:54.380
It's true. We keep our mouths shut,
yeah, we'll all be fine, eh?

30:54.380 --> 30:57.300
There's a rumour going around
someone's dogged us already.

30:57.300 --> 30:58.820
Louis Bayeh.

30:58.820 --> 31:01.015
One of our own.

31:02.580 --> 31:04.260
I find out one of us has dogged,

31:04.260 --> 31:06.580
and they'll end up with a bullet
in their fucking head.

31:06.580 --> 31:09.538
You hear that expression
"he protests too much"?

31:10.900 --> 31:13.540
What the hell's
that supposed to mean?

31:13.540 --> 31:16.373
I reckon even you can
figure that one out, Parrot.

31:18.340 --> 31:19.660
Hey! Oi! Oi!
Settle down!

31:19.660 --> 31:21.060
Settle it down!
Parrot!

31:21.060 --> 31:23.540
Eddie, sit down!
I'm alright.

31:23.540 --> 31:26.100
But you've had
some sort of problem with me

31:26.100 --> 31:27.780
ever since I became sergeant.

31:27.780 --> 31:28.820
Shut up.

31:28.820 --> 31:30.660
Now you have a problem
because you're on notice.

31:30.660 --> 31:31.740
Sit down.

31:31.740 --> 31:34.049
Shut up, the pair of ya!

31:35.100 --> 31:37.375
Now, where did you hear this rumour?

31:39.740 --> 31:43.260

31:43.260 --> 31:45.260

Listen up, gentlemen...

31:58.380 --> 32:01.620
...we are the thin line that protects
pricks like Justice Wood,

32:01.620 --> 32:05.010
and keeps him safe and sound in
his North Shore mansion at night.

32:06.660 --> 32:11.097
We have done nothing wrong,
so we have nothing to fear.

32:13.340 --> 32:14.489

32:19.180 --> 32:21.540
Alright.

I wanna discuss with ya.

32:35.580 --> 32:38.860
I've got three grand in my glove box
I'm looking to split with someone.

32:38.860 --> 32:40.660
Oh, yeah? I assume there's a catch.

32:40.660 --> 32:43.140
Yeah, Billy Bayeh's looking for
a raid on the Budget.

32:43.140 --> 32:46.020
Look, Trev, I've got a fucking lot
on my plate right now, mate.

32:46.020 --> 32:48.660
Yeah, but you blokes need some wins.
This would be an easy one.

32:48.660 --> 32:50.940
You don't have to go near Bayeh,
I'll handle that side.

32:50.940 --> 32:55.140
Trev... mate, no offence,
but I'm not touching it.

32:55.140 --> 32:58.655
OK? It's just circumstances,
that's all.

33:00.140 --> 33:02.140
Yeah, fair enough.

Hey, um, do you need a lift home?

Mate, I am stone cold sober. You
might as well get some joy out of it.

33:08.540 --> 33:10.690
I'll be right, mate.
I'll grab a cab.

33:16.700 --> 33:18.340
Having given our cooperation,

33:18.340 --> 33:21.980
we will emerge from this process
a better organisation,

pride and confidence now.

The Commissioner's words

33:41.020 --> 33:45.300

these kind of places from now on.

34:21.340 --> 34:23.092
(SIGHS)

34:36.060 --> 34:39.540
So, why would
Detective Sergeant Gould

34:39.540 --> 34:42.213
approach you in particular
with this suggestion?

34:43.780 --> 34:47.380
Because he saw me
in some strip shows.

34:47.380 --> 34:49.974
But the proposition was
that you help run a brothel.

34:52.340 --> 34:54.659
I also worked as a prostitute.

34:54.659 --> 34:56.969
And he knew that?

35:00.020 --> 35:03.140
A lot of police used to come into
the brothel where I worked.

35:03.140 --> 35:05.654
I guess it was pretty well-known.

35:06.780 --> 35:10.180
Right now, Kim, we only have
your word against his.

35:10.180 --> 35:12.460
In order to prove your allegations,

35:12.460 --> 35:15.180
we would need to gather
some evidence.

35:15.180 --> 35:16.780
We also need to find out

35:16.780 --> 35:20.180
the names of Gould's partners
in this enterprise.

35:20.180 --> 35:21.820
(SIGHS) I understand that.

35:21.820 --> 35:24.580
And the only effective way
for us to do that

35:24.580 --> 35:27.860
is for you to pretend to cooperate
with him, wearing a wire,

35:27.860 --> 35:29.340
a recording device.

35:29.340 --> 35:31.296
Is that something
you're prepared to do?

35:34.780 --> 35:37.580
I've got a lot of classes
at the academy right now, so...

35:37.580 --> 35:41.020
Obviously, you'll have to
maintain your cover,

35:41.020 --> 35:44.020
so that's something
we can all work around.

35:44.020 --> 35:46.340
Kim, we can't force you to do this.

35:46.340 --> 35:48.570
This kind of surveillance work
can be dangerous.

35:55.420 --> 35:58.059
I'll do it.
Good girl.

36:00.380 --> 36:02.340
I'd also like to follow up on

36:02.340 --> 36:04.700
what you told us about
police using brothels.

Do you think you could
write us a list

to come with me.

why does it have to be Trevor?

Why not some
