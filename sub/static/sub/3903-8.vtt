00:15.849 --> 00:18.149
Hi, we're not here. Leave a message.

00:18.248 --> 00:20.349
Elena, you gotta talk to me.

00:21.448 --> 00:23.048
Last call.

00:29.248 --> 00:31.649
Why is she such a pain in the ass?

00:34.148 --> 00:35.848
-Excuse me.
-Hey, pal.

00:35.948 --> 00:38.948
It's all right. One more, please.

00:40.048 --> 00:43.348
-Save some for the other customers, okay?
-Pour it!

00:46.548 --> 00:50.748
-You ain't getting behind the wheel, right?
-There's a cab picking me up.

00:54.047 --> 00:58.747
I'm looking you in the eye, Gus.
I'm telling you, I'm not driving a car tonight.

01:38.547 --> 01:39.746
Bite me.

03:01.244 --> 03:02.744
Yeah, coffee.

03:03.744 --> 03:07.044
-What's with the hand?
-Just a scratch.

03:17.144 --> 03:19.243
Get me some eggs, will you?

03:20.044 --> 03:23.743
-Can I get a scrapple with that?
-You can get anything you want.

03:26.744 --> 03:27.843
Oh, God!

05:51.839 --> 05:54.239
Look at him, all high and mighty.

05:54.339 --> 05:57.739
You ain't gonna let that shit ride, are you?
After what he did?

05:57.839 --> 06:00.139
I'd truck his ass, if it was me.

06:00.939 --> 06:03.239
He's built kind of solid, though.

06:03.339 --> 06:07.538
Maui ain't all that.
It's the clothes that give him size, Zig.

06:08.339 --> 06:11.038
-You think?
-His ass is candy, Zig.

06:11.238 --> 06:13.838
You, you're the legend of the docks.

06:15.338 --> 06:19.238
Truck him with your best punch
and then just walk the fuck away.

06:21.538 --> 06:24.638
Officially, I've put us on the hook
for 14 open homicides.

06:24.738 --> 06:26.938
So either we bring in a hell of a case...

06:27.038 --> 06:29.538
or I'm as big a fool
as Col. Rawls thinks I am.

06:29.638 --> 06:31.938
That sounded a little desperate.

06:32.738 --> 06:34.137
Not entirely.

06:34.538 --> 06:38.737
Lester, enlighten Miss Pearlman
as to the status of our investigation.

06:39.838 --> 06:43.637
You said this case needed a drug connect
for a wiretap, right?

06:44.937 --> 06:46.937
Come take a look at this.

06:50.337 --> 06:53.837
That's the DNR log
on the phone listed to the warehouse...

06:53.938 --> 06:56.037
where we tracked the suspect container.

06:56.137 --> 06:59.637
It shows outgoing calls to numbers
that connect to Petey Dixon...

06:59.737 --> 07:02.137
Proposition Joe Stewart,
and "White Mike" McArdle...

07:02.237 --> 07:04.037
among other traffickers on the East Side.

07:04.137 --> 07:08.336
Which supports surveillance of known
dealers coming and leaving the warehouse.

07:08.436 --> 07:11.137
Also, some surveillance shots
and matching mug shot photos...

07:11.237 --> 07:15.237
from Southeast DEU,
which tie White Mike to street dealers...

07:15.337 --> 07:17.437
that we've already
made controlled buys from.

07:17.536 --> 07:20.537
Assuming exhaustion,
that's one tap on the warehouse phone.

07:20.636 --> 07:23.437
-What's your PC on the truck driver?
-Sergei Malatov:

07:23.537 --> 07:27.636
resident alien, Ukrainian origin.
No criminal history here.

07:28.136 --> 07:30.836
We ID'd him from the contract
on the DAC truck rental.

07:30.936 --> 07:34.036
He was nice enough to give
the truck rental people his cell number.

07:34.136 --> 07:36.836
And phone records show
a call placed to the warehouse...

07:36.936 --> 07:40.336
at the time Kima observed him on the docks
using the cell phone.

07:40.436 --> 07:42.136
Checking the DNR log's history...

07:42.236 --> 07:44.636
we matched seven other calls
from that cell phone...

07:44.736 --> 07:47.936
to dates and times when
a container disappeared from a Talco ship.

07:48.036 --> 07:51.035
Anything else? Tap 2 feels a bit thin.

07:51.136 --> 07:54.836
How about Nicholas Sobotka
of the 1400th block on Reynolds Street?

07:59.135 --> 08:01.735
On a Cl's information,
Herc and Carver followed him...

08:01.835 --> 08:04.035
from a drug meet
along the Fayette Street strip...

08:04.135 --> 08:06.335
back to his parents'
South Baltimore row home.

08:06.435 --> 08:08.735
When we ran that phone number
from that address...

08:08.835 --> 08:11.535
through the DNR at our warehouse,
we got nothing.

08:11.635 --> 08:15.835
But when we checked it against
the cell phone of our friend, Sergei...

08:15.935 --> 08:19.535
-we got a couple of hits.
-Sobotka's your stated target, right?

08:19.635 --> 08:21.934
This is a nephew, and from the look of it...

08:22.034 --> 08:25.034
he's involved in street dealing
as much as smuggling.

08:25.134 --> 08:28.334
But right now, this case feels like
a lot more than Frank Sobotka.

08:28.434 --> 08:31.234
-No offense to Stan Valchek.
-Okay.

08:32.333 --> 08:34.833
I admit, you've got PC.

08:35.634 --> 08:38.634
On the warehouse phone
and on the trucker's cell phone, too.

08:38.734 --> 08:40.933
Now what have you got for exhaustion?

08:41.034 --> 08:42.333
Any possible informants?

08:42.433 --> 08:45.234
-Nothing on the docks.
-No one we can buy weight with.

08:45.334 --> 08:48.133
-Surveillance?
-That got us to the front door...

08:48.233 --> 08:51.333
but it's not gonna get us
inside that warehouse.

08:52.234 --> 08:54.833
Start typing. I'll call the judge.

09:02.833 --> 09:06.434
Ham and cheese sandwich,
and one of them Frappuccino drinks.

09:10.833 --> 09:13.433
-I hear Charles lost his leg.
-What?

09:16.233 --> 09:18.633
Frappuccino? What the fuck is that?

09:19.332 --> 09:21.633
He's all pussy, Zig. Cold cock him.

09:21.733 --> 09:24.132
Take him, Zig. Now's the time.

09:36.033 --> 09:38.832
What do you know?
The pissant's got some grapes on him.

09:38.932 --> 09:40.332
Banana, too.

09:52.932 --> 09:54.332
Fucking shit!

09:57.132 --> 10:00.632
-Take us up.
-Son of a bitch! God damn it!

10:02.032 --> 10:03.231
Fuck you!

10:04.631 --> 10:07.232
You big, stupid, fucking oaf!
Fuck you, Maui.

10:08.431 --> 10:10.232
You're the fucking wimp.

10:10.332 --> 10:12.331
No, fuck you, Maui!

10:15.431 --> 10:17.731
-Stay there.
-Fuck you!

10:24.231 --> 10:25.531
God damn it!

10:27.231 --> 10:31.330
Any of you fucks try to help him down,
you'll be up there with him.

10:31.431 --> 10:36.130
Bad advice!
You motherfuckers gave me bad advice!

10:46.630 --> 10:47.630
Shit.

10:48.730 --> 10:52.730
-What the hell are you wearing?
-No one mentioned all the perks.

10:53.830 --> 10:55.130
Lacrosse?

10:55.430 --> 10:57.930
What, a brother can't run with a stick?

10:58.030 --> 11:00.429
Jim Brown was an all-American midfielder
at Syracuse.

11:00.529 --> 11:02.830
You putting yourself beside Jim Brown?

11:02.930 --> 11:05.529
Lester, I'm just saying....

11:06.629 --> 11:08.529
I thought you were born in pinstripes.

11:08.629 --> 11:12.230
Lieutenant, I was under the impression
that when detailed against his will...

11:12.330 --> 11:15.229
to some backwards-ass,
no-count, out-in-the-districts...

11:15.329 --> 11:18.329
Iost-ball-in-tall-grass drug investigation...

11:18.429 --> 11:20.129
a veteran police of means and talent...

11:20.229 --> 11:22.229
can wear whatever the fuck
he damn well pleases.

11:22.329 --> 11:23.829
Up to a point.

11:25.329 --> 11:26.629
-Nice shot.
-Thank you.

11:26.729 --> 11:31.129
It's a hell of a thing to take a downtown
police and lose him in a cross-town world.

11:31.229 --> 11:33.228
Take that one over there.

11:33.328 --> 11:35.129
I'm homesick already.

11:36.228 --> 11:40.029
I don't know what you're laughing at.
You can kiss my ass.

11:47.628 --> 11:50.428
You should see
what your boy tried to pull today.

11:50.528 --> 11:51.928
Fucking Ziggy.

11:54.528 --> 11:57.228
-What are you looking for?
-Can't find the fucking bills.

11:57.328 --> 12:00.728
-End of the month, everything's hanging.
-We got anything for the Greeks?

12:00.828 --> 12:04.327
Wednesday, the Caspia over at Patapsco.
Nicky'll go get the slips tomorrow.

12:04.327 --> 12:05.328
Wednesday, the Caspia over at Patapsco.
Nicky'll go get the slips tomorrow.

12:05.628 --> 12:09.628
No wonder I couldn't find them.
You use them as bookmarks.

12:15.327 --> 12:17.828
Let me ask you something important.

12:19.127 --> 12:21.727
You like fake tits? I can't decide.

12:22.528 --> 12:25.027
Thus far, I'm undecided on fake tits.

12:32.027 --> 12:34.127
I thought I knew what paperwork was.

12:34.227 --> 12:38.527
But what you all go through,
to listen to someone else's phone calls....

12:56.726 --> 12:58.926
You all cannot spell for shit.

13:00.626 --> 13:02.626
Would we be police if we could?

13:02.726 --> 13:05.426
-Who's the duty judge this week?
-Vanderwal.

13:05.526 --> 13:06.526
You think he'll sign?

13:06.625 --> 13:10.826
No problem, if you clean his garage first.
Or wash his windows, maybe.

13:12.126 --> 13:13.826
Fucking Vanderwal.

13:14.525 --> 13:15.926
Wash windows?

13:26.626 --> 13:30.125
-Are these the affiants, Miss Pearlman?
-Yes, Your Honor.

13:30.925 --> 13:34.526
Are you willing to affirm that
the information offered in this affidavit...

13:34.626 --> 13:36.625
is entirely true
to the best of your knowledge?

13:36.725 --> 13:38.325
Yes, Your Honor.

13:39.525 --> 13:41.725
-Yes, Your Honor.
-Absolutely.

13:41.825 --> 13:45.025
Upstairs, gentlemen.
Third floor, back bedroom.

13:45.724 --> 13:47.324
Sash installation.

13:47.725 --> 13:51.125
And then if you can give
the windows a wash.... Thank you.

13:54.125 --> 13:57.024
It's a good thing I took the Sergeant's test.

13:57.124 --> 13:59.425
-Fuck, my knee.
-Sorry.

13:59.724 --> 14:01.924
-First name?
-First name: Francis.

14:02.024 --> 14:03.824
Spell the last name on the account.

14:03.925 --> 14:06.824
S-O-B-O-T-K-A.

14:08.424 --> 14:10.924
Yeah, that's it. It's a business address.

14:11.024 --> 14:13.224
-You've been flagged.
-Flagged?

14:13.624 --> 14:15.024
It says right here on the computer.

14:15.624 --> 14:16.923
Yeah? You're kidding me.

14:17.024 --> 14:19.124
I don't have any more information
on that now.

14:21.324 --> 14:22.924
Whatever, okay.

14:23.323 --> 14:26.323
The check's on its way tomorrow.
Cross my heart.

14:33.923 --> 14:37.823
Horse, if you don't pay your phone bill
for three months, what happens?

14:37.923 --> 14:39.223
No phone.

14:39.723 --> 14:44.123
Okay, so I'm 90 days late on my cell phone,
but they let me go...

14:44.623 --> 14:46.223
even before I mail the check in.

14:46.323 --> 14:50.423
I ask the nice lady in the billing department
why that is. You know what she says?

14:50.523 --> 14:52.622
-I've been flagged.
-Flagged?

14:52.923 --> 14:55.423
She says it's on the computer
when my account comes on:

14:55.523 --> 14:58.023
"Do not disconnect for non-payment."

14:59.322 --> 15:02.522
"Flagged," what the fuck is that?
What am l, special?

15:03.323 --> 15:05.822
Maybe you been touched by an angel.

15:11.023 --> 15:12.422
Told you, B.

15:12.523 --> 15:15.322
Tumbleweeds be blowing
through this motherfucker.

15:15.422 --> 15:19.522
-Like the fiends all cleaned themselves up.
-No, that ain't it, man.

15:19.922 --> 15:23.921
Word is out,
we just selling dog shit up in here, man.

15:26.122 --> 15:27.121
Damn.

15:35.622 --> 15:38.922
-Pud, how we doing?
-Slow as a white man in slippers.

15:40.422 --> 15:41.921
All right, later.

15:43.321 --> 15:47.621
We dying 'cause these dusty-ass fiends
done found the real someplace else.

15:47.721 --> 15:49.621
It's that bullshit, man.

15:51.021 --> 15:53.221
You two got a reason to be here?

15:53.321 --> 15:56.520
-We're just going about our business.
-Keep moving.

15:59.221 --> 16:02.521
Fake-ass police.
Where he get that uniform at? Kmart?

16:02.621 --> 16:06.821
He wouldn't even be all chest-out
if we had some people up in this bitch.

16:07.520 --> 16:09.320
Shit is fucked up, man.

16:12.720 --> 16:14.921
Damn, junior, you had a night.

16:16.020 --> 16:18.121
Even for a legendary motherfucker
like yourself--

16:18.221 --> 16:19.420
Drop it.

16:20.620 --> 16:22.720
What is wrong with you, man?

16:23.920 --> 16:27.720
'Cause Elena didn't open up the door
for your ass...

16:27.820 --> 16:30.520
you just gonna let all this shit fly out?

16:32.419 --> 16:34.920
Come on, Jimmy. Lighten up.

16:44.019 --> 16:45.619
Come and get me.

16:46.320 --> 16:49.320
So, you guys going for a wiretap
on that port case?

16:52.520 --> 16:56.419
They got every swinging dick with a shield
on that detail but me.

16:57.419 --> 16:58.919
You jealous, bitch?

16:59.519 --> 17:01.819
I'd rather be back in Homicide.

17:03.618 --> 17:06.118
I'd take your place in a heartbeat.

17:08.019 --> 17:09.019
Why?

17:15.018 --> 17:18.919
-That floater showing up in your dreams?
-No, it's not just her.

17:21.417 --> 17:25.718
I mean, who am l, Captain Chesapeake?
I need to get off that boat, Bunk.

17:25.818 --> 17:27.518
I need to do a case.

17:30.418 --> 17:32.518
I mean, if I'm not gonna....

17:35.618 --> 17:37.518
If I'm no good for....

17:48.917 --> 17:51.818
If that's all you want, just go and ask Rawls.

17:52.217 --> 17:56.018
-He'll put you on this straightaway.
-Yeah, why wouldn't he?

18:07.117 --> 18:10.817
...after which I tell Horse
to go down the southeast lot...

18:10.917 --> 18:14.617
and steal the most expensive thing
he can drive, which he does.

18:14.717 --> 18:18.017
And we box it up
and ship it to every port you can name.

18:18.117 --> 18:19.517
Where is it now?

18:19.617 --> 18:22.417
Somewhere between New Orleans
and the West Coast.

18:22.517 --> 18:24.616
How's that for your kid brother?

18:24.716 --> 18:27.617
You said you were gonna
bring something over?

18:28.717 --> 18:30.016
Just this.

18:32.816 --> 18:34.016
Read it.

18:34.516 --> 18:37.216
-What is it?
-A confirmation letter, like.

18:38.116 --> 18:42.016
You know that labor position
on the port advisory board I told you about?

18:42.116 --> 18:44.416
I put you up for it. You're on.

18:44.716 --> 18:45.916
I'm on?

18:46.316 --> 18:50.416
I ain't been union since they closed
the dry dock. How come I'm on?

18:51.515 --> 18:54.016
The board chair and me,
we got a relationship.

18:54.116 --> 18:56.015
You mean, you greased it.

18:58.316 --> 19:01.315
The chairman,
he thought you'd be right for it, is all.

19:01.416 --> 19:04.916
There's a stipend comes with it.
$200 a month, Lou.

19:06.015 --> 19:07.015
When I get home at night, I just wanna
watch a ball game or something.

19:07.015 --> 19:10.015
When I get home at night, I just wanna
watch a ball game or something.

19:10.115 --> 19:13.015
I'm not up to go to no meetings or anything.

19:13.315 --> 19:16.315
Christ, Lou,
you don't gotta go to all the meetings.

19:16.415 --> 19:20.015
Just show up once in a while,
let them know you're alive.

19:21.715 --> 19:23.315
That's not for me.

19:25.015 --> 19:26.515
What's for you?

19:27.114 --> 19:30.214
That shitwagon parked out front
needs a battery.

19:30.614 --> 19:34.115
Or this kitchen here
has been rigged the same way for 25 years.

19:34.215 --> 19:36.414
Whatever I got comes straight.

19:40.114 --> 19:42.315
That's real noble, big brother.

19:43.414 --> 19:45.014
Not noble. Right.

19:48.014 --> 19:52.114
The shipbuilders' local goes belly-up,
and that makes you some kind of martyr?

19:52.214 --> 19:54.114
The only difference between me and you...

19:54.214 --> 19:57.314
-is you picked the wrong union.
-That ain't the only difference.

19:57.414 --> 20:00.013
-If you were in my position--
-I'm not.

20:03.514 --> 20:08.113
To tell you the truth, I'm glad
I don't have to make those kind of choices.

20:12.014 --> 20:13.314
Come on, kid.

20:14.813 --> 20:16.013
Sit down.

20:34.012 --> 20:36.213
You really used to race pigeons
with my PePop?

20:36.313 --> 20:38.113
We all did back then.

20:38.413 --> 20:42.412
I gave one to a seaman
on a Dutch tanker one time.

20:42.512 --> 20:44.912
He set her loose in the middle of the ocean.

20:45.012 --> 20:48.012
Damned if she didn't find her way
back to Hull Street.

20:48.112 --> 20:51.212
Which, by the way, is more than I can say
about your grandfather...

20:51.312 --> 20:53.212
when he was in the bag.

20:55.612 --> 20:57.712
How come they don't fly away?

20:59.612 --> 21:01.412
His wings are clipped.

21:09.112 --> 21:11.212
How much for this one, Mr. Diz?

21:11.312 --> 21:14.511
Why don't you start out with pigeons, Zig?
You can train pigeons.

21:14.711 --> 21:16.411
Them things got lice.

21:16.911 --> 21:19.511
They bring the plague, for Christ's sake.

21:27.211 --> 21:28.711
Thanks, Mr. Diz.

21:31.011 --> 21:34.011
I tried. Rawls hates his guts.

21:34.511 --> 21:38.411
-With reasons.
-But the thing of it is, Jimmy's dying inside.

21:39.411 --> 21:41.711
He's a train wreck
unless he catches a real case.

21:41.811 --> 21:43.811
-But good police.
-Always.

21:44.011 --> 21:46.110
The thing of it is, Lieutenant...

21:46.811 --> 21:49.911
Jimmy McNulty, when he ain't policing...

21:51.010 --> 21:54.811
he's a picture postcard
of a drunken, self-destructive fuck-up.

21:55.110 --> 21:57.110
And when he is policing...

21:57.910 --> 21:59.611
he's pretty much the same motherfucker.

21:59.710 --> 22:03.310
But on a good case,
he's running in front of the pack.

22:04.710 --> 22:07.810
That's as close as the man comes
to being right.

22:09.510 --> 22:11.110
Go back to Rawls.

22:16.110 --> 22:17.309
So I get paid?

22:17.509 --> 22:20.509
Yeah, you get paid, but you don't get paid.
We get paid.

22:20.709 --> 22:23.209
Why don't they give you the money
and leave me out of it?

22:23.309 --> 22:26.309
'Cause we need someone to be
Confidential lnformant Number 238...

22:26.409 --> 22:30.509
registered with the department.
We get you registered, we get paid.

22:31.209 --> 22:34.509
-So you're gonna send my picture--
-And your social security number.

22:34.609 --> 22:37.509
And they give me money which you keep,
and I don't get nothing.

22:37.609 --> 22:40.609
Cuz, did you do anything
to deserve the money?

22:41.109 --> 22:42.309
Did you?

22:42.609 --> 22:45.008
Yeah, we cracked a fucking case wide open.

22:45.108 --> 22:47.209
We brought back
very significant information...

22:47.309 --> 22:50.509
about a major drug trafficker.
That's what we did.

22:50.909 --> 22:54.908
But that's your fucking job, right?
You get paid a salary for that.

22:56.308 --> 23:00.109
Bernard, you're upsetting my partner, man.
What are you doing?

23:01.108 --> 23:02.208
10%.

23:03.808 --> 23:05.608
10% goes to me and I don't tell.

23:05.708 --> 23:08.808
You don't tell
because your ma and my ma are sisters.

23:08.908 --> 23:12.208
-That's why you don't tell.
-We're not even gonna use your real name.

23:12.308 --> 23:14.707
You'll be registered as Fuzzy Dunlop,
a street name.

23:17.608 --> 23:18.908
10%.

23:22.008 --> 23:25.807
Wonderful, now I'm in business
with the whole fucking family.

23:27.707 --> 23:30.207
It's payday, Zig. Once again.

23:36.007 --> 23:37.307
All that?

23:38.207 --> 23:42.107
We're rolling out there.
I can't hand this shit off fast enough.

23:43.307 --> 23:44.907
Nice sled you got.

23:46.207 --> 23:48.707
Zero percent interest. Money's cheap.

23:48.806 --> 23:51.207
"Money's cheap"?
What the fuck does that mean?

23:51.307 --> 23:54.007
It means I got a good deal, you peckerhead.

23:55.106 --> 23:57.607
You should think of getting
some new wheels yourself.

23:57.707 --> 23:59.507
Yeah, I'm gonna do that.

23:59.706 --> 24:02.807
You gonna get a car,
you're gonna need some jack.

24:03.206 --> 24:05.006
Worry about yourself.

24:08.506 --> 24:10.507
I heard you took on Maui.

24:11.806 --> 24:16.006
-Boy needed to get schooled.
-What are you, some kind of badass now?

24:21.006 --> 24:23.405
-Yeah, it's me.
-Niko, things okay?

24:23.906 --> 24:27.006
-Things are going great.
-Ifyou need more, talk to Sergei.

24:27.106 --> 24:30.606
I gotta see you soon.
I'll call you back in a few, all right?

24:31.906 --> 24:33.005
Is that the man?

24:33.205 --> 24:36.305
-You don't have to concern yourself--
-I wanna meet him.

24:36.405 --> 24:40.006
Let me handle the business.
I mean, you're getting paid, right?

24:40.106 --> 24:43.505
Fuck you! I'll play the game for myself.

24:44.205 --> 24:47.105
-Take the money, Zig.
-You don't think I can do it?

24:47.205 --> 24:49.605
Pick up the fucking money, Ziggy.

24:49.805 --> 24:52.405
-I don't want it. You pick it up.
-You.

24:54.304 --> 24:55.505
Fuck you.

25:06.405 --> 25:09.805
I was wondering about the La-Z-Boy chairs
I ordered. They come in yet?

25:09.904 --> 25:11.604
-How many you ordered?
-That'd be three.

25:12.805 --> 25:14.105
Your order's in.

25:15.304 --> 25:17.804
-Yes?
-It's Nick.

25:18.004 --> 25:19.304
How's it going?

25:19.404 --> 25:22.704
I'm ready to talk about more, okay?
Youjust say where and when.

25:22.804 --> 25:24.504
I'll call you back.

25:27.604 --> 25:31.903
-Not as careful as Barksdale's people were.
-This ain't West Baltimore.

25:32.504 --> 25:36.503
They are on their phones
because they don't expect us to be on them.

25:37.504 --> 25:41.403
Let me shorten this conversation for you:
It's never gonna happen.

25:41.503 --> 25:44.403
McNulty goes after it.
I could use someone like him.

25:44.503 --> 25:48.403
And I could use three more inches of meat.
It ain't gonna happen.

25:52.703 --> 25:56.203
You ever see how a dog gets
when he smells a bone buried in the yard?

25:56.303 --> 25:59.503
Yeah, and I seen one
take a shit on my carpet, too.

25:59.903 --> 26:04.502
And don't give me that he's-got-that-fire-
in-the-belly garbage, either.

26:04.602 --> 26:04.903
The answer is no.

26:04.903 --> 26:06.202
The answer is no.

26:07.602 --> 26:09.703
What I need from you, I get.

26:10.403 --> 26:12.902
-No bullshit, no arguments.
-What?

26:13.802 --> 26:18.203
When I agreed to take these murders
for you, I made my terms clear, remember?

26:19.503 --> 26:21.702
I need McNulty on this detail.

26:23.202 --> 26:27.802
Jesus, Lieutenant. When I said "anything,"
I meant I'd let you have a kiss...

26:28.602 --> 26:31.902
feel my tits or something, you know?
But not this.

26:33.302 --> 26:35.701
You want me to clear those bodies?

26:48.801 --> 26:50.401
See that you do.

26:58.001 --> 26:59.201
Who they?

27:00.402 --> 27:03.201
They might be some CBS boys
drifting from down south...

27:03.301 --> 27:06.301
or might be some of Tavon's crew
from over on Edmondson.

27:06.401 --> 27:07.801
This far over?

27:09.601 --> 27:11.500
I know one thing, though.

27:11.700 --> 27:14.101
-What?
-They're serving our customers.

27:19.201 --> 27:22.201
-Marine unit, Diggins.
-I'm looking for McNulty.

27:22.600 --> 27:24.100
McNulty, for you.

27:33.600 --> 27:34.600
It's Daniels...

27:36.100 --> 27:37.600
Get back to your office.

27:42.500 --> 27:44.199
Thanks, Lieutenant.

27:58.599 --> 28:01.000
This new generation with the names....

28:05.099 --> 28:07.099
$150? Jesus.

28:07.999 --> 28:10.899
He turned us onto
the Sobotka kid, Lieutenant.

28:19.799 --> 28:21.998
This is the other half of the case, right here.

28:22.099 --> 28:25.599
Three apartments on the sixth floor,
all leased out to Pyramid, lnc...

28:25.699 --> 28:27.998
the same people
who own the drug warehouse.

28:28.098 --> 28:30.599
Is this where the girls are staying?
Or something more?

28:30.699 --> 28:32.998
No, the building's too nice
for room and board.

28:33.098 --> 28:35.299
A building this nice is for the johns.

28:35.399 --> 28:38.499
-Makes them feel safer.
-How do they bring them in? The lobby?

28:38.599 --> 28:41.898
-Garage, probably.
-Either they have a garage card...

28:41.998 --> 28:44.198
or they're being shuttled in
by someone who does.

28:44.298 --> 28:47.498
You get that piece and you're in.
If the people running the girls...

28:47.598 --> 28:49.598
are connected
to the ones running the drugs...

28:49.697 --> 28:53.698
you can knock off the brothel
and then listen in on your wiretaps.

28:54.297 --> 28:56.297
Tickle the wire like that.

28:57.298 --> 28:58.498
Exactly.

29:01.698 --> 29:03.797
Pleasure boats, topless women.

29:04.798 --> 29:08.797
I'm telling you, now the weather's turned,
I gotta roll, Diggsy.

29:09.698 --> 29:10.897
Thanks.

29:21.497 --> 29:24.697
-We ain't be been paid since yesterday.
-And the day before that.

29:24.797 --> 29:27.597
What the fuck?
Come on, dawg, are we back up or what?

29:27.697 --> 29:29.797
We up, but we ain't in it.

29:29.897 --> 29:33.097
What we got can't stand up
to what they moving down the way, so....

29:33.296 --> 29:36.197
Boy, we about to dry up and blow away,
and shit.

29:36.297 --> 29:38.596
Yo, man, I ain't got nothing for you.

29:38.696 --> 29:40.496
How you gonna act like that?

29:40.597 --> 29:43.897
Look, I feel you,
but I still gotta let you go so....

29:46.896 --> 29:50.096
At least we get
some of that separation pay though, right?

29:50.196 --> 29:54.196
Man, you better go on
before I lose my composure out this bitch.

29:58.295 --> 30:02.096
These motherfuckers. Separation pay.

30:03.195 --> 30:04.895
Separate your ass.

30:07.396 --> 30:10.096
Assumption number one
is the people running the girls...

30:10.196 --> 30:12.895
and the people running the drugs
are the same crew.

30:12.995 --> 30:15.795
Assumption number two
is that the apartments in that condo...

30:15.895 --> 30:18.196
are working as a cathouse
with those Russian girls.

30:18.296 --> 30:22.095
Which means you have to get someone
in there undercover to make a case.

30:23.295 --> 30:26.195
I'm thinking we need
a more subtle touch here.

30:26.395 --> 30:29.795
I'd march into hell for you, Lieutenant.
You know that.

30:29.995 --> 30:32.594
He doesn't look like he'd have to pay.

30:35.595 --> 30:39.394
-Sorry, no. Domestic issues at home.
-Same for me.

30:39.895 --> 30:42.494
Nadine would have them in a jar
by the side of the bed...

30:42.695 --> 30:44.795
if she even heard tell of it.

30:53.494 --> 30:54.594
What?

30:54.894 --> 30:57.194
Takes a whore to catch a whore.

30:59.494 --> 31:01.194
What the fuck did I do?

31:01.494 --> 31:04.494
Give me a couple beers, Dolores.
Look at this.

31:07.594 --> 31:09.294
I say, look at this.

31:10.393 --> 31:12.194
Dolores, is that you?

31:13.794 --> 31:18.493
Dolores, I'd like you to meet my attorney.
This is Steven L. Miles.

31:21.493 --> 31:24.493
I may not be able to see through
all the bullshit in here...

31:24.593 --> 31:26.493
but he can. So, if you will...

31:26.593 --> 31:30.193
I'd like a stiff one for myself
and one for my counselor.

31:30.493 --> 31:33.193
-Tell me he's a fake.
-That'd be lying, hon.

31:33.292 --> 31:35.193
Is they real diamonds around its neck?

31:35.293 --> 31:37.593
You sick, boy. You just sick.

31:37.693 --> 31:39.993
Like I'm the only guy in South Baltimore...

31:40.093 --> 31:43.493
that ever tried to win the affections
of a farm animal?

31:45.593 --> 31:48.393
Enough talk. Now chop-chop.

31:49.392 --> 31:54.292
I'd like one for the house and don't forget
to water my fine, feathered friend here.

31:55.592 --> 31:58.692
If it's for the duck, the next round is on me.

31:58.992 --> 31:59.992
Easy, there.

32:00.092 --> 32:02.692
We're gonna need a saucer, hon.
Put some beer in it.

32:02.793 --> 32:04.292
He needs a chaser.

32:04.392 --> 32:06.392
Put it on my tab, Dolores.

32:09.191 --> 32:12.992
Pace yourself. You're drinking
with the longshoremen tonight.

32:22.391 --> 32:23.891
That look right to you?

32:23.991 --> 32:27.191
Same truck as carried the girls,
same mope driving.

32:27.492 --> 32:29.491
What about the passenger?

32:29.791 --> 32:31.591
Looks the part to me.

32:37.691 --> 32:42.491
Container ship on the Talco line,
name of Caspia, docks tomorrow a.m.

32:42.591 --> 32:44.491
Our man Horseface on it?

32:45.891 --> 32:49.990
I better call the Lieutenant,
let him know we gotta set up on this.

32:51.290 --> 32:55.591
This time, though, we got the wire up.
Eyes and ears both.

33:23.290 --> 33:25.190
There goes the shuttle.

33:32.389 --> 33:33.589
What's he waiting on?

33:33.689 --> 33:36.889
Getting himself all steeled up
to tell some tales.

33:38.189 --> 33:39.689
Lying to the wife's easy.

33:39.789 --> 33:43.189
It's looking your kid in the eye
that's the hard part.

34:00.188 --> 34:01.388
Police!

34:08.789 --> 34:10.688
Let's see your license.

34:15.688 --> 34:17.987
"Robert Johnson." You believe that?

34:20.388 --> 34:23.888
Bob, I'm very disappointed in you.
Wanna go home, Bob?

34:25.388 --> 34:29.088
Okay, suppose a lonely fellow wants to meet
a nice young lady in this town.

34:29.188 --> 34:31.087
How does he go about it?

34:34.387 --> 34:36.387
He'd dial that phone number.

34:40.088 --> 34:42.187
Dial the number. What else?

34:42.587 --> 34:44.587
Punch in those four numbers there.

34:47.187 --> 34:49.087
-And?
-Ask for Eve.

34:49.286 --> 34:51.087
-What?
-Ask for Eve.

35:01.087 --> 35:02.687
Go on, go home.

35:06.787 --> 35:08.287
Godspeed, Bob.

35:08.986 --> 35:11.487
-Johnson.
-My ticket to the dance.

35:23.586 --> 35:25.786
Here we go. We got one.

35:27.386 --> 35:29.086
1 2-14, Kima.

35:29.186 --> 35:31.686
We got a disappeared can
just hit the chassis.

35:31.785 --> 35:33.886
Affirmative. I'll eyeball it to the gate.

35:33.986 --> 35:35.686
-Raise our boys.
-Right.

35:35.786 --> 35:38.485
-What's Kima rolling as?
-Gas and electric.

35:58.885 --> 36:01.785
-Yes?
-Everything's good.

36:02.085 --> 36:04.285
-You coming in now?
-Yes.

36:54.683 --> 36:57.683
White DAC truck coming at you
pulling a red can.

36:57.783 --> 37:00.683
Serial Number: X-W-B, as in "boy"...

37:00.783 --> 37:03.983
C-1-5-7-7-2-6-8.

37:04.283 --> 37:08.083
-Driver: white male with brown hair. Copy?
-Copy.

37:08.983 --> 37:10.983
I'm out of this as soon as he clears the gate.

37:11.083 --> 37:13.683
The van has too much profile on it
right now.

37:13.783 --> 37:15.783
Copy that, too. We're up.

37:21.883 --> 37:24.382
-Broken seal?
-Hey, Frank.

37:25.882 --> 37:26.883
What's missing?

37:26.983 --> 37:29.682
Nothing so as we can tell.
Can's full of diapers.

37:29.783 --> 37:31.882
-Diapers?
-Disposables, yeah.

37:32.382 --> 37:36.383
I'm thinking not even your crew
would steal Pampers off the dock, right?

37:36.482 --> 37:38.082
I'm not so sure.

37:38.182 --> 37:41.482
Customs seal probably just broke
on the offload, is all.

37:48.482 --> 37:51.082
When's Bea Russell coming back
from the Fairfield piers?

37:51.182 --> 37:53.881
Who, Beadie? She's not down Fairfield.

37:53.981 --> 37:56.682
Don't you worry, Frank.
Your girl will be back soon enough.

37:56.781 --> 37:58.381
-Yeah?
-She's detailed.

37:58.481 --> 38:00.882
Something to do with city police.

38:12.381 --> 38:13.981
All right, we're up.

38:14.881 --> 38:17.080
I'm out. You have the eyeball.

38:17.381 --> 38:18.981
12-08, copy that.

38:24.681 --> 38:27.281
First I got this thing on my phone bill.

38:27.481 --> 38:30.381
Now I hear Bea Russell's doing some shit
with real police.

38:30.581 --> 38:31.881
You're paranoid, Frank.

38:31.981 --> 38:34.380
-Why would she lie?
-Shit if I know.

38:37.081 --> 38:40.480
-The Greek has two today, right?
-Boris comes back in an hour.

38:40.580 --> 38:44.480
The second can's in a lower bay
ready to offload when I get to it.

38:44.981 --> 38:47.980
Check that can through straight up.
You got it?

38:48.080 --> 38:49.980
Enter it on the computer, like any other.

38:50.080 --> 38:52.680
The next can after it,
make that one disappear.

38:52.780 --> 38:54.080
You want me to lose a clean can?

38:54.180 --> 38:57.679
-And give it to the Russian, yeah.
-You gonna tell them?

38:57.979 --> 39:01.780
If I'm going nuts, I'll calm down tomorrow.
We'll slip the hot can off the pier.

39:01.880 --> 39:04.680
If I'm right about this, they'll thank me.

39:05.879 --> 39:09.179
And, Horse, make sure nobody's living
in that can when you stack it.

39:09.279 --> 39:10.679
I know.

39:18.879 --> 39:20.679
We got something here.

39:21.179 --> 39:24.078
Another disappeared can
just hit the chassis.

39:24.579 --> 39:26.479
They're running them out in tandem.

39:26.579 --> 39:29.579
-That means "one after the other," Jimmy.
-I know what it means.

39:29.679 --> 39:30.879
1 2-08.

39:31.179 --> 39:32.879
Carver, what's the status of your truck?

39:33.578 --> 39:35.478
Left the can at the warehouse
and rolled out.

39:35.879 --> 39:38.879
-You want us on the truck or the can?
-The can.

39:39.079 --> 39:40.178
Copy.

39:42.679 --> 39:44.678
-I got no eyes at the port.
-Kima?

39:44.778 --> 39:46.778
-She pulled up.
-I got it.

39:48.378 --> 39:50.678
But the truck already left. You won't make it.

39:50.778 --> 39:53.278
I'll call the MPA, delay the truck.

39:53.978 --> 39:56.478
Do it. You're still here?

39:58.778 --> 40:00.077
Good call.

40:27.677 --> 40:31.677
License and registration, please.
You were doing 24 mph in a 20 mph zone.

40:32.577 --> 40:35.577
-You stop for 24 mph?
-License and registration.

41:52.774 --> 41:56.174
Christ, I wish we had a tap
on the port office phone.

42:01.275 --> 42:03.274
I just wanted to give you a heads up.

42:03.374 --> 42:06.075
That last little item we sent out, it's wrong.

42:06.174 --> 42:08.274
I knew it was wrong when I let it go.

42:08.874 --> 42:10.774
Not on the phone, Frank.

42:12.074 --> 42:15.773
Okay, but this time he needs to be there.

42:16.774 --> 42:19.774
In fact, he wants to be there
to hear this shit.

42:54.173 --> 42:55.773
Go ahead, open it.

43:24.572 --> 43:26.071
Bobbie Dolls.

43:43.371 --> 43:46.071
What the fuck is this bullshit?

43:47.171 --> 43:51.071
I am waiting for Russian vodka
and you bring me trash from Taiwan.

43:51.171 --> 43:53.870
Give me your phone. Fucking Polacks.

43:54.371 --> 43:56.870
Are they thieves or are they stupid?

44:02.171 --> 44:04.271
He's dialing the same number.

44:06.370 --> 44:08.370
It came, but it's nothing.

44:09.071 --> 44:10.471
It's bullshit.

44:12.770 --> 44:16.871
I was expecting this. Just get rid of it.

44:17.570 --> 44:18.970
Get rid of it where?

44:20.570 --> 44:22.770
Drop it in the fucking street.

44:26.670 --> 44:29.270
-This is sweet.
-The boss man.

44:30.470 --> 44:32.070
And we're on him.

44:32.669 --> 44:35.070
-7 a.m.?
-Man, what the fuck do you think?

44:35.170 --> 44:37.669
We gotta be there, in place,
when they come on.

44:37.769 --> 44:39.069
Shit is early.

44:39.669 --> 44:41.069
Y'all down for this?

44:41.169 --> 44:44.770
'Cause I can find me some motherfuckers
to swing bats for me if I have to.

44:44.870 --> 44:47.369
You didn't say nothing about no bats.
All right.

44:47.469 --> 44:50.969
That's the fuck I'm talking about.
Bring your boys, too. 7:00.

44:51.069 --> 44:52.870
-Hey, Poot.
-Yo, Poot.

44:54.869 --> 44:56.469
Come on, man.

44:58.769 --> 45:01.469
God damn,
you're a pussy-crazed motherfucker.

45:01.569 --> 45:03.868
A nigger can't look at a female?

45:04.068 --> 45:06.569
Yeah, but you be getting dizzy
behind that shit.

45:06.669 --> 45:09.569
-At least I be getting some.
-Well, I be getting some, too.

45:09.669 --> 45:12.068
But I don't make it my everything.

45:15.168 --> 45:17.168
Lieutenant, you still up?

45:18.168 --> 45:19.369
I'm here.

45:19.668 --> 45:22.369
I'm still on this second can,
but it doesn't make sense.

45:22.469 --> 45:25.768
He went to ground
at an appliance store off Eastern.

45:26.068 --> 45:27.768
Now he's dumping it.

45:28.668 --> 45:30.668
10-4. Come home.

45:31.568 --> 45:36.268
-You don't wanna sit on the can?
-Negative. The can is clean.

45:55.168 --> 45:57.167
I don't know, Uncle Frank.

45:57.267 --> 46:00.167
Putting two and two together,
and coming up with six, maybe.

46:00.267 --> 46:01.467
Maybe.

46:02.167 --> 46:04.467
You called Spiros still, right?

46:06.767 --> 46:08.767
Spiros will know what to do.

46:10.866 --> 46:14.567
Come past early tomorrow.
I wanna get down the diner first thing.

46:14.667 --> 46:15.966
All right.

46:21.067 --> 46:22.967
I can't keep up with him.

46:23.067 --> 46:24.866
What's with the duck?

46:26.466 --> 46:27.567
Ziggy.

46:36.666 --> 46:38.066
Is Daniels around?

46:38.166 --> 46:40.866
-No.
-What's the deal with can number two?

46:41.266 --> 46:42.666
No contraband.

46:43.066 --> 46:46.865
Heard them complaining about it
on the wire. Somebody fucked up.

46:47.866 --> 46:51.865
The fact is, they even called the boss man
about it.

46:55.766 --> 46:58.565
That's a good day.
You guys going for a taste?

46:58.666 --> 47:01.065
No, I'm gonna chase the paperwork.

47:02.166 --> 47:06.365
I gotta spring the sitter.
But for a ride home, I'll go for a quick beer.

47:06.465 --> 47:09.965
-But more than one, I get sleepy.
-Yeah, me, too.

47:11.365 --> 47:14.465
-What, you short a car?
-Need new brake pads.

47:28.864 --> 47:30.764
Two. Boys.

47:31.765 --> 47:33.265
How about you?

47:34.164 --> 47:35.664
Boy and a girl.

47:36.064 --> 47:37.664
And your husband, he....

47:37.764 --> 47:41.064
None of my business, I know,
but did he die or something?

47:41.165 --> 47:45.364
You mean 'cause no one would leave
a beauty like me unless he kicked?

47:45.564 --> 47:47.164
I was just asking.

47:47.864 --> 47:49.163
He left me.

47:50.064 --> 47:51.264
Left us.

47:52.764 --> 47:54.564
Picked up, moved south.

47:56.164 --> 47:58.563
Said it was either my job or him.

47:59.864 --> 48:03.163
That I was neglecting my duties
around the house, all that.

48:03.263 --> 48:06.863
Said that he didn't get married
in order to cook his own dinner.

48:06.963 --> 48:09.663
Anyway, he's cooking his own dinner now.

48:14.463 --> 48:17.763
What about with you and your wife?
What happened?

48:20.663 --> 48:21.862
She died.

48:26.762 --> 48:30.463
-Not now, Gus. I'm good.
-Whatever you say, Jimmy.

48:33.262 --> 48:35.062
So, you about ready to go?

48:35.463 --> 48:38.363
-Sure.
-Be right back. I just gotta make a call.

49:00.861 --> 49:02.962
Please enter your code now.

49:05.961 --> 49:09.361
-Hi, may I help you?
-Yeah, let me talk to Eve.

49:11.961 --> 49:14.562
-This is Eve.
-I'm looking to connect.

49:14.662 --> 49:16.162
Would you like a date tonight?

49:16.262 --> 49:19.761
No, not tonight.
I'm back in town in a couple of nights.

49:20.161 --> 49:24.061
-Have you been entertained by us before?
-No, first time for me.

49:24.161 --> 49:26.861
We can arrange whatever you like,
whenever you like.

49:26.961 --> 49:29.461
What kind of a girl are you looking for?

49:29.561 --> 49:33.061
We have a variety for you to choose from
when you arrive.

49:33.660 --> 49:35.260
When are you thinking of coming?

50:09.559 --> 50:11.359
Just give me a minute.

50:49.459 --> 50:52.559
Stop! Move away from the cookiejar.

51:34.557 --> 51:35.757
Long day.

51:36.957 --> 51:38.757
Yeah, me, too.

51:52.356 --> 51:54.156
Thanks for the beer.

51:55.057 --> 51:56.257
Goodbye.

52:14.656 --> 52:16.656
Hey, y'all, they coming.

52:17.255 --> 52:19.956
What these motherfuckers think
they looking at?

52:20.856 --> 52:23.056
Nigger, you've lost
your motherfucking mind.

52:23.156 --> 52:25.956
-You're standing on my real estate.
-Mine now.

52:27.055 --> 52:30.756
-Took it while you was resting.
-Y'all too late.

52:35.055 --> 52:39.555
Look, I'm gonna let you walk off right now,
or we could do it the other way.

52:39.855 --> 52:42.555
Who you got to do it the other way? Them?

52:47.455 --> 52:50.555
-You gonna see me in your sleep.
-Yeah, I know.

52:55.055 --> 52:57.455
That's right. Keep walking, bitch.

52:58.355 --> 53:00.155
They gonna come back.

53:00.954 --> 53:04.354
Yeah. The way we just punked them,
they got to.

53:12.254 --> 53:15.554
-Where is he?
-You can talk to me, Frank.

53:15.654 --> 53:18.554
-This is bigger than you.
-I'll tell him what you say.

53:18.654 --> 53:20.554
Bullshit. Come on, Nick.

53:29.253 --> 53:32.854
That's the Greek? That old guy?
I seen him in here before.

53:35.053 --> 53:36.454
Have a seat.

53:53.453 --> 53:55.853
A long time since we talk, Frank.

53:56.653 --> 53:58.953
-Coffee, something?
-We're good.

54:01.852 --> 54:03.552
What's on your mind?

54:04.952 --> 54:06.652
Every goddamn thing.

54:07.153 --> 54:09.952
For one,
I think my cell phone's being tapped.

54:10.052 --> 54:13.653
All of a sudden, the phone company
don't care if I pay my bills anymore.

54:13.753 --> 54:17.352
Meantime, I hear that our regular port cop,
the one that found your girls...

54:17.452 --> 54:20.652
got pulled off to work some special thing
with the city police.

54:20.752 --> 54:23.152
-So you switched the can.
-I ran a test.

54:23.252 --> 54:25.852
I gave you that clean one,
put yours in the stacks.

54:25.952 --> 54:28.652
Straight away,
the MPA cops stop that Russian's truck...

54:28.752 --> 54:30.852
right after he picked it up.

54:31.251 --> 54:33.552
I think someone's got a line
into our computer.

54:33.652 --> 54:34.651
Very smart.

54:34.852 --> 54:37.951
As soon as you called,
I shut down the warehouse.

54:38.452 --> 54:41.652
That's fine. But now we're going to
have to open the warehouse again.

54:41.752 --> 54:44.852
Lose a few more clean cans,
deliver them there.

54:45.751 --> 54:48.951
If someone's watching,
show them we have nothing to hide.

54:49.051 --> 54:51.651
Our cut stays the same though, right?

54:52.051 --> 54:53.451
You kidding?

54:53.851 --> 54:55.451
What's your name?

54:55.651 --> 54:57.551
-Nick.
-Sobotka.

55:00.850 --> 55:03.051
That's a fair question, Niko.

55:03.351 --> 55:06.851
But it has to be the same for everyone:
no work, no pay.

55:06.951 --> 55:10.150
Doesn't matter what's in the cans.
We still gotta check them through.

55:10.250 --> 55:13.750
-That's work, isn't it?
-We take gas, so do you.

55:13.850 --> 55:16.051
-You don't understand--
-I understand completely.

55:16.151 --> 55:18.250
No one is in this for love.

55:19.550 --> 55:21.450
It ain't just the money.

55:21.650 --> 55:25.451
I got things happening right now.
Things with my union. Right now!

55:26.050 --> 55:30.550
Not a fucking month from now,
when the legislative session is history. Now!

55:36.250 --> 55:39.749
Okay. We pay you still.

55:40.550 --> 55:43.950
I'm thinking of all the business we do
in the future...

55:44.549 --> 55:46.750
and I want you should be happy.

55:48.450 --> 55:49.649
Thanks.

55:55.050 --> 55:56.949
It's a new world, Frank.

55:58.150 --> 56:00.349
You should go out
and spend some of the money...

56:00.449 --> 56:04.549
on something you can touch:
a new car, a new coat.

56:05.449 --> 56:08.249
It's why we get up in the morning, right?
