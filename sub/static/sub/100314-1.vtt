00:00.601 --> 00:02.936
(metal whirring)

00:02.936 --> 00:06.607
(gentle instrumental music)

00:12.580 --> 00:14.748
(buzzer ringing)

00:14.748 --> 00:16.184
(rope creaking)

00:16.184 --> 00:18.752
-  What you
did inside that place

00:18.752 --> 00:20.988
will be with you forever.

00:20.988 --> 00:21.822
-  No.

00:21.822 --> 00:23.591
(choking)

00:23.591 --> 00:25.759
(yelling)

00:27.261 --> 00:30.931
(gentle instrumental music)

00:36.570 --> 00:38.572
(dog barking)

00:38.572 --> 00:41.709
- The towering walls of the
original prison exteriors,

00:41.709 --> 00:44.278
erected over 300 years ago,

00:44.278 --> 00:46.680
were left in place as a reminder

00:46.680 --> 00:50.584
of the punishment
awaiting Spanish citizens

00:50.584 --> 00:52.586
who dared step outside the law.

00:55.489 --> 00:56.990
Nearly 50 years ago,

00:56.990 --> 00:59.760
a modern prison was
built in the center

01:01.095 --> 01:05.132
to hold some of Puerto
Rico's most feared criminals,

01:05.132 --> 01:07.268
an ironic clash of architecture

01:07.268 --> 01:09.603
between the old and the new.

01:11.439 --> 01:13.841
Today the concrete
and metal structure

01:13.841 --> 01:16.043
will come tumbling
down this afternoon

01:16.043 --> 01:17.845
on Santiago precinct,

01:17.845 --> 01:20.248
but the foundation
will remain in place

01:20.248 --> 01:23.083
as the building block
of the most contemporary

01:23.083 --> 01:25.085
of condominium complexes

01:26.187 --> 01:27.655
on the far edge of a city

01:27.655 --> 01:29.923
that has continued to change.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.459
Puerto Rico (mumbling).

01:31.459 --> 01:34.128
(paper tearing)

01:35.129 --> 01:38.799
(gentle instrumental music)

01:38.799 --> 01:41.569
(dog whimpering)

01:52.613 --> 01:55.683
(car engine running)

02:41.595 --> 02:43.764
(yelling)

03:00.681 --> 03:03.317
(rope creaking)

03:19.767 --> 03:22.002
(mumbling)

03:24.638 --> 03:27.375
- Hey, what the hell
are you doing here?

03:27.375 --> 03:28.208
Huh?

03:29.109 --> 03:30.378
Get out.

03:30.378 --> 03:31.879
We're demolishing
this place today.

03:31.879 --> 03:32.713
Get out.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.482
(mumbling)

03:34.482 --> 03:38.719
(speaking in a foreign language)

03:38.719 --> 03:42.155
Hey, this place has
been wired for two days.

03:42.155 --> 03:43.090
- I know.

03:43.090 --> 03:44.392
- You're lucky that I find you,

03:44.392 --> 03:45.859
so get out.

03:45.859 --> 03:46.694
- I just--

03:46.694 --> 03:47.928
- I said get out, man.

03:47.928 --> 03:50.163
(mumbling)

03:52.700 --> 03:54.402
(seagulls squawking)

03:54.402 --> 03:58.038
(gentle instrumental music)

04:00.007 --> 04:02.576
- What else do you want from me?

04:17.591 --> 04:20.093
What you did inside that place

04:21.094 --> 04:23.831
will be with you forever,

04:23.831 --> 04:24.665
forever.

04:27.335 --> 04:29.570
(mumbling)

04:36.710 --> 04:39.447
(metal clanging)

04:50.090 --> 04:52.760
(wood thudding)

05:03.303 --> 05:05.473
(yelling)

05:58.025 --> 06:00.728
(buzzer ringing)

06:06.734 --> 06:09.470
(metal rattling)

06:15.409 --> 06:18.178
(buzzer ringing)

06:23.451 --> 06:24.952
(seagulls squawking)

06:24.952 --> 06:27.621
(water flowing)

06:29.623 --> 06:33.727
(speaking in a foreign language)

06:46.339 --> 06:48.576
(laughing)

07:07.127 --> 07:10.798
(gentle instrumental music)

07:12.666 --> 07:15.669
- Miguel, after what
I've done for you,

07:15.669 --> 07:17.404
you decide to write
letters to the press

07:17.404 --> 07:22.409
about what you claim to
be intolerable conditions

07:23.777 --> 07:26.179
and injustices that are
happening inside this prison.

07:29.817 --> 07:31.819
The only thing your
letters did, Miguel,

07:33.286 --> 07:34.121
fan the flames,

07:35.288 --> 07:37.591
which means I have to
turn up the heat on you.

07:41.428 --> 07:42.262
- No, no.

07:42.262 --> 07:43.096
- No?

07:43.096 --> 07:43.964
- No, no.

07:43.964 --> 07:44.798
- No.

07:46.500 --> 07:49.102
(mumbling)

07:49.102 --> 07:51.872
(paper rustling)

07:54.908 --> 07:57.110
Since it is apparently
not Mr. Mendoza

07:57.110 --> 07:59.713
who is the cause of
our current problems,

07:59.713 --> 08:02.115
please make him understand
how helpful it would be

08:02.115 --> 08:04.217
if he can provide us
with any information

08:04.217 --> 08:06.453
that might assist
us in our search.

08:06.453 --> 08:10.123
(gentle instrumental music)

08:13.961 --> 08:16.129
(yelling)

08:17.430 --> 08:21.535
(speaking in a foreign language)

08:35.015 --> 08:35.849
Hey.

08:37.784 --> 08:40.287
Governor Mandera sped
up the execution process

08:40.287 --> 08:42.022
to save the taxpayers money.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.625
Now he thinks he can
have it both ways?

08:44.625 --> 08:46.126
- That's your friend.

08:46.126 --> 08:48.996
(yelling)

08:48.996 --> 08:50.063
- That's politics.

08:50.063 --> 08:52.232
(car engine running)

08:52.232 --> 08:54.735
A few people protesting
outside the prison walls

08:54.735 --> 08:56.336
against the death penalty

08:56.336 --> 08:58.271
shouldn't be enough to
make the governor nervous.

08:58.271 --> 08:59.707
- With all the stories breaking

08:59.707 --> 09:02.876
about prisoner treatment, yes.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.511
(speaking in a foreign language)

09:04.511 --> 09:06.046
- What can I get you gentlemen?

09:07.547 --> 09:09.883
- Will you get us
a table please?

09:09.883 --> 09:10.718
-  Sure.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.321
- How long have you been open?

09:14.321 --> 09:15.889
- Just opened.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.659
I am beginning to get
the hang of it now.

09:18.659 --> 09:20.127
Since it's your first time here,

09:20.127 --> 09:21.461
the coffee is on the house.

09:23.063 --> 09:23.897
- Thank you.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.634
- The death penalty is only

09:26.634 --> 09:29.603
a publicity stunt
by politicians.

09:29.603 --> 09:31.739
It doesn't (mumbling) violence.

09:31.739 --> 09:32.572
- Excuse me?

09:35.108 --> 09:37.077
- I couldn't help but overhear.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.345
Two cups of coffee on the house.

09:38.345 --> 09:39.412
- Thank you again.

09:40.781 --> 09:45.452
The warden is only here to
fulfill the will of the people.

09:46.586 --> 09:47.788
- The will of the people?

09:47.788 --> 09:50.958
- Yes, his job is to
make sure the directive

09:50.958 --> 09:54.061
of the people is
completed as efficiently

09:54.061 --> 09:55.262
and quickly as possible.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.131
- What about all the reports

09:58.131 --> 10:00.801
of prisoner beatings,
guard violence?

10:01.669 --> 10:03.170
- Are you one of those people

10:03.170 --> 10:05.205
who has been protesting
outside the prison walls?

10:07.040 --> 10:08.642
- When I'm not here, yes.

10:08.642 --> 10:09.476
It's important.

10:10.577 --> 10:12.579
- Why would you do that?

10:12.579 --> 10:15.448
Why spend time and energy

10:15.448 --> 10:16.717
fighting for the rights of men

10:16.717 --> 10:19.019
who've done so much
harm to other people

10:19.019 --> 10:21.188
they could never
hope to repay them?

10:21.188 --> 10:23.323
- Because they have rights.

10:23.323 --> 10:24.524
- They have rights.

10:24.524 --> 10:26.960
- Of course,
thankfully we were able

10:26.960 --> 10:29.062
to get rid of Warden Silva,

10:29.062 --> 10:32.099
but since his replacement
was appointed from within,

10:33.533 --> 10:35.435
I'm sure he'll be a crooked
son of a bitch as well.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.606
(laughing)

10:39.606 --> 10:42.342
- I happen to know
that the new warden

10:42.342 --> 10:46.079
is very committed to
doing whatever is possible

10:46.079 --> 10:48.248
to improve the conditions
inside the prison.

10:49.249 --> 10:51.318
- And how do you know that?

10:51.318 --> 10:53.186
- 'Cause I'm the
crooked son of a bitch.

10:55.889 --> 10:56.656
See?

10:58.458 --> 10:59.292
I'm sorry.

10:59.292 --> 11:00.093
Listen.

11:01.661 --> 11:02.830
It's very clear to me

11:02.830 --> 11:03.931
that you're passionate
about the issue,

11:03.931 --> 11:04.765
and I like that.

11:04.765 --> 11:05.999
I like that a lot.

11:05.999 --> 11:09.036
In fact, I think that
we need more passion

11:09.036 --> 11:10.637
on both sides of it.

11:10.637 --> 11:11.839
(singing in a foreign language)

11:11.839 --> 11:13.606
I'll have my secretary
set something up.

11:13.606 --> 11:16.209
You and I can sit
down and talk more

11:16.209 --> 11:18.211
at length about it, Mrs.?

11:18.211 --> 11:20.647
- Burke, Maria Burke.

11:20.647 --> 11:23.116
(upbeat instrumental music)

11:23.116 --> 11:24.317
- Burke?

11:24.317 --> 11:25.152
- Yes.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.356
- I don't know
your husband, do I?

11:30.991 --> 11:32.325
- His name is Dylan,

11:33.927 --> 11:34.928
Dylan Burke.

11:36.663 --> 11:40.333
(gentle instrumental music)

11:42.069 --> 11:46.039
(singing in a foreign language)

11:51.478 --> 11:55.115
(gentle instrumental music)

12:05.325 --> 12:06.726
- Son of a bitch.

12:09.362 --> 12:13.033
(gentle instrumental music)

12:33.586 --> 12:35.655
I think the Corrections
Board will listen

12:35.655 --> 12:38.425
to this proposal you've
outlined, Mrs. Burke.

12:38.425 --> 12:39.626
- I hope so.

12:39.626 --> 12:42.362
From here, it can only
get better, right?

12:42.362 --> 12:45.298
(buzzer ringing)

12:45.298 --> 12:47.534
- I'd like to ask you
an indelicate question.

12:49.036 --> 12:51.071
Did you meet your husband
before he went to prison?

12:52.672 --> 12:53.473
- I'm sorry.

12:54.674 --> 12:56.376
- Your husband is
a convict, correct?

12:56.376 --> 12:57.677
- Ex-convict.

12:57.677 --> 12:59.179
- Ex-convict.

12:59.179 --> 13:01.081
The reason I ask is we have
to do background checks

13:01.081 --> 13:03.250
on everyone who comes
in and out of here,

13:03.250 --> 13:04.384
including spouses.

13:05.819 --> 13:08.889
- I didn't meet him until
after that point in his life.

13:08.889 --> 13:09.722
- I see.

13:10.757 --> 13:11.992
Has he ever shared with you

13:11.992 --> 13:14.094
any of the details
about his past?

13:14.094 --> 13:15.562
- No, not everything.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.431
I didn't really need to know.

13:18.431 --> 13:21.068
There I things I wouldn't
tell him about mine.

13:21.068 --> 13:22.602
They call it the
past for a reason.

13:22.602 --> 13:23.703
It's behind us.

13:25.072 --> 13:26.806
- I have to tell you
it is very refreshing

13:26.806 --> 13:28.108
to meet someone like you.

13:29.276 --> 13:31.311
- Don't you believe
in second chances?

13:31.311 --> 13:32.779
That should be on
your mind every day.

13:32.779 --> 13:35.715
- It is, and I used to
believe in second chances

13:35.715 --> 13:39.186
when I was very naive.

13:39.186 --> 13:40.420
You have to
understand, Mrs. Burke.

13:40.420 --> 13:41.621
There is no one in here

13:41.621 --> 13:42.923
who is under the illusion

13:42.923 --> 13:45.258
that they are being remolded

13:45.258 --> 13:47.995
to fit into society
outside of these walls.

13:47.995 --> 13:49.863
The best we can hope to do

13:49.863 --> 13:52.632
is contain these men

13:52.632 --> 13:54.567
and do that with the
limited resources

13:54.567 --> 13:56.603
we have available to us.

13:56.603 --> 13:58.171
- Does your wife agree with you?

13:59.539 --> 14:04.144
- My wife didn't get to
experience this part of my life.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.680
She unfortunately
was taken from me

14:07.680 --> 14:09.282
a very long time ago.

14:09.282 --> 14:10.083
- I'm sorry.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.184
- No, it's all right.

14:14.087 --> 14:15.388
What does your husband do?

14:15.388 --> 14:17.190
- He's a fisherman.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.825
He loves it out there.

14:18.825 --> 14:20.293
In fact, his whole
crew is made up

14:20.293 --> 14:22.462
of men that he did time with
at one point or another.

14:22.462 --> 14:23.630
-  I see.

14:23.630 --> 14:26.666
- It's his way of
making up for his past.

14:26.666 --> 14:28.101
- We all need that, don't we?

14:30.103 --> 14:33.006
Well, I will speak informally
with the Board about this,

14:33.006 --> 14:34.174
take their temperature.

14:34.174 --> 14:35.943
You and I should
meet again very soon,

14:35.943 --> 14:37.911
keep the momentum
moving forward.

14:37.911 --> 14:38.811
That would be key.

14:39.846 --> 14:40.780
- Thank you very much.

14:40.780 --> 14:42.916
- You're welcome.

14:42.916 --> 14:45.085
(yelling)

14:47.654 --> 14:48.588
(water flowing)

14:48.588 --> 14:52.259
(gentle instrumental music)

15:11.344 --> 15:14.247
(insects chirping)

15:19.819 --> 15:22.555
(wood knocking)

15:22.555 --> 15:24.291
Hello, Mrs. Burke.

15:24.291 --> 15:26.493
- Warden, did you speak
to anyone on the Board?

15:26.493 --> 15:27.727
- Yes, I did.

15:27.727 --> 15:28.962
- And?

15:28.962 --> 15:30.663
- And they, well,
there is a shot

15:30.663 --> 15:32.332
that we can get a lot of, well,

15:32.332 --> 15:34.767
most of your proposals
in front of the Board.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.003
- Great.

15:36.003 --> 15:37.870
- Should we go have a
bite and talk about it?

15:40.073 --> 15:41.308
You've been cooped up

15:41.308 --> 15:43.610
at your coffee shop
all day, I'm sure.

15:43.610 --> 15:44.777
Why don't we just go have dinner

15:44.777 --> 15:46.479
and continue talking?

15:46.479 --> 15:47.814
- No, thank you.

15:47.814 --> 15:48.748
I'll come to your office

15:48.748 --> 15:50.250
to talk about this further.

15:50.250 --> 15:51.884
I'll check with your secretary.

15:51.884 --> 15:54.554
- Good, I'll let her
know to expect your call.

15:58.258 --> 15:59.092
- Goodnight.

15:59.092 --> 16:00.093
- Goodnight.

16:00.093 --> 16:02.962
(insects chirping)

16:04.697 --> 16:08.368
(gentle instrumental music)

16:18.511 --> 16:22.515
(singing in a foreign language)

16:27.054 --> 16:31.158
(speaking in a foreign language)

16:40.567 --> 16:43.203
- That's the look of a
man with a good strike.

16:43.203 --> 16:45.638
- That's the look
of a man in love.

16:45.638 --> 16:46.573
- Listen up.

16:46.573 --> 16:49.876
If any of you ever find a woman

16:49.876 --> 16:51.111
to stay by your side,

16:51.111 --> 16:52.745
let alone one like Maria,

16:54.147 --> 16:56.983
you better treat her with
the proper attention,

16:56.983 --> 16:59.552
or she will end up
looking for comfort

16:59.552 --> 17:02.455
in some other smelly,
tequila drinking,

17:02.455 --> 17:04.590
good for nothing man's arms.

17:04.590 --> 17:06.826
(laughing)

17:08.361 --> 17:09.829
- But if he didn't come back,

17:11.164 --> 17:12.964
I sure would have
taken Maria out,

17:14.067 --> 17:17.404
and then in and showed
her a good time.

17:17.404 --> 17:18.605
- Who said that?

17:18.605 --> 17:20.940
Was it the gringo that
sweats like a pig,

17:20.940 --> 17:24.477
the one with the limp
rod and the empty bed?

17:24.477 --> 17:26.613
-  Yeah, but
that all could change.

17:26.613 --> 17:27.646
- What did you say?

17:27.646 --> 17:28.815
- Oh.

17:28.815 --> 17:30.250
(upbeat instrumental music)

17:30.250 --> 17:31.218
- Kick his ass.

17:31.218 --> 17:33.086
(singing)

17:33.086 --> 17:35.255
(yelling)

17:39.892 --> 17:42.162
(laughing)

17:43.730 --> 17:45.232
* There's no hope

17:45.232 --> 17:47.400
(singing)

17:49.169 --> 17:50.002
- See you later,
boys, all right?

17:50.002 --> 17:52.172
(singing)

17:53.373 --> 17:56.209
* Without feeling

17:57.510 --> 17:59.679
(singing)

18:01.748 --> 18:04.784
* Tell my love

18:04.784 --> 18:07.787
* That no matter how far

18:07.787 --> 18:11.524
* My dear old shipmate

18:11.524 --> 18:15.495
* Will make this trip, mate

18:15.495 --> 18:17.664
(singing)

18:20.967 --> 18:23.670
* The devil sea

18:23.670 --> 18:24.771
* Is a place

18:24.771 --> 18:26.939
(singing)

18:27.974 --> 18:30.710
* Where the fishermen go

18:30.710 --> 18:34.714
* If they don't go to hell

18:34.714 --> 18:37.950
* Where the skies seem clear

18:37.950 --> 18:41.120
* Nothing seems wrong

18:42.389 --> 18:44.557
(singing)

18:48.060 --> 18:51.631
* And it adds to this song

18:51.631 --> 18:55.735
(speaking in a foreign language)

19:07.914 --> 19:10.149
(laughing)

19:10.149 --> 19:13.820
(gentle instrumental music)

19:14.721 --> 19:17.457
(metal clicking)

19:24.297 --> 19:29.302
* You'll never hear
me say your name *

19:31.238 --> 19:35.708
* You'll never catch me

19:35.708 --> 19:40.580
* Looking your way

19:40.580 --> 19:44.617
* Too proud

19:44.617 --> 19:49.556
* To say it out loud

19:49.556 --> 19:54.461
* How I love

19:54.461 --> 19:58.531
* When you look
at me like this *

19:58.531 --> 20:03.135
* Like we're the only

20:03.135 --> 20:07.607
* Two people that exist

20:07.607 --> 20:12.178
* I breathe you in

20:12.178 --> 20:16.716
* I feel you up
against my skin *

20:16.716 --> 20:21.621
* And now I know

20:21.621 --> 20:25.758
* I give in to you

20:25.758 --> 20:30.430
* You've got me hooked

20:30.430 --> 20:34.901
* You take me higher than

20:34.901 --> 20:39.539
* I've ever been

20:39.539 --> 20:44.176
* You take me higher than

20:44.176 --> 20:47.246
* I've ever been

20:47.246 --> 20:48.381
(birds chirping)

20:48.381 --> 20:49.949
- It was perfect.

20:49.949 --> 20:53.986
(speaking in a foreign language)

21:54.547 --> 21:56.683
(singing)

22:03.356 --> 22:04.290
Yes, ma'am.

22:06.025 --> 22:10.096
(speaking in a foreign language)

22:29.582 --> 22:31.751
(singing)

22:54.140 --> 22:57.209
(car engine running)

23:09.456 --> 23:13.125
(gentle instrumental music)

23:33.079 --> 23:34.413
(metal thudding)

23:34.413 --> 23:38.084
(upbeat instrumental music)

23:46.425 --> 23:48.394
(singing in a foreign language)

23:48.394 --> 23:52.499
(speaking in a foreign language)

23:55.001 --> 23:56.302
Really, huh?

23:56.302 --> 23:59.906
(speaking in a foreign language)

23:59.906 --> 24:03.075
(yelling and laughing)

24:08.815 --> 24:10.249
- Well, it's your anniversary.

24:10.249 --> 24:12.952
I needed to make sure that
you're gonna celebrate properly.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.053
- Beers on me.

24:14.053 --> 24:17.056
(speaking in a foreign language)

24:17.056 --> 24:20.827
(singing in a foreign language)

24:20.827 --> 24:22.094
(balls clacking)

24:22.094 --> 24:25.765
(upbeat instrumental music)

24:34.040 --> 24:34.874
- Wow.

24:39.311 --> 24:41.781
(groaning)

24:41.781 --> 24:44.483
-  What are you doing?

24:44.483 --> 24:48.487
(singing in a foreign language)

24:52.959 --> 24:57.063
(speaking in a foreign language)

25:06.539 --> 25:09.208
- Just pick a goddamn
ball and shoot.

25:09.208 --> 25:12.044
(mumbling)

25:12.044 --> 25:14.013
(ball clacking)

25:14.013 --> 25:17.684
(upbeat instrumental music)

25:23.122 --> 25:24.924
- Whoa, there's people
waiting in line.

25:24.924 --> 25:26.125
If I were you,

25:26.125 --> 25:28.761
I would grab a beer
and wait for your turn.

25:28.761 --> 25:29.996
- I got next.

25:29.996 --> 25:31.530
- Yeah, I got a
problem with that.

25:32.699 --> 25:33.933
- Do you?

25:33.933 --> 25:35.167
- Yeah, I got a
problem with that.

25:35.167 --> 25:36.435
(speaking in a foreign language)

25:36.435 --> 25:37.369
- Why don't you stop
running your mouth?

25:37.369 --> 25:38.437
-  Hey, hey, come on.

25:38.437 --> 25:39.271
Calm down.

25:39.271 --> 25:40.472
We'll work this out.

25:40.472 --> 25:41.941
Come on, hey.

25:41.941 --> 25:42.809
- I'm not gonna let this
clown talk to you like that.

25:42.809 --> 25:43.610
- Come on, hey.

25:43.610 --> 25:44.677
Don't say that, bro.

25:44.677 --> 25:45.845
Don't say that.

25:45.845 --> 25:47.914
You know, I actually
think my man,

25:47.914 --> 25:49.215
what was your name?

25:49.215 --> 25:50.650
- Shane.

25:50.650 --> 25:54.086
- Shane, I think my man
Shane here has a point, okay?

25:54.086 --> 25:58.625
(mumbling) if I put the
eight ball straight in.

25:58.625 --> 26:00.159
- No, why--

26:00.159 --> 26:04.897
- Hey, but if I put it in
off one rail, he's second.

26:04.897 --> 26:07.033
Two rails, he's third,

26:07.033 --> 26:09.736
and three rails, he grabs
his money and walks home.

26:09.736 --> 26:10.970
-  You?

26:10.970 --> 26:11.971
-  Well,
what do you think?

26:11.971 --> 26:12.905
- I think that's
a terrible idea.

26:12.905 --> 26:13.706
I want to have a good night.

26:13.706 --> 26:14.641
- You have no faith--

26:14.641 --> 26:15.441
- I set up this whole thing--

26:15.441 --> 26:16.142
- You have no faith.

26:16.142 --> 26:16.976
Hey, shut up.

26:16.976 --> 26:18.210
Shut up.

26:18.210 --> 26:18.645
Okay, well, what do
you think, Shane?

26:21.080 --> 26:22.014
- Okay.

26:22.014 --> 26:23.282
- All right, there you go, okay.

26:25.251 --> 26:28.487
All right, now I'm gonna
tell you boys something.

26:28.487 --> 26:30.156
Whatever happens
after this shot,

26:31.991 --> 26:33.192
the most important thing

26:34.393 --> 26:36.763
is that I have made
a new friend tonight.

26:38.564 --> 26:39.832
Isn't that right, Shane?

26:41.000 --> 26:43.169
(yelling)

26:48.741 --> 26:49.676
Come on.

26:49.676 --> 26:53.245
(upbeat instrumental music)

27:08.661 --> 27:12.665
(singing in a foreign language)

27:28.848 --> 27:31.017
(yelling)

27:32.351 --> 27:34.854
(laughing)

27:34.854 --> 27:38.090
- Come on. (mumbling)

27:38.090 --> 27:41.761
(upbeat instrumental music)

27:57.443 --> 28:01.380
(crowd applauding and cheering)

28:08.955 --> 28:11.824
- Hey, hey, hey. (laughing)

28:11.824 --> 28:16.562
Hey. (speaking in
a foreign language)

28:16.562 --> 28:18.630
When Maria first
introduced me to the man

28:18.630 --> 28:20.166
that was to be her husband,

28:22.101 --> 28:26.138
I told my sister than
an ex-con fisherman

28:26.138 --> 28:30.843
with a crew exactly
just like him,

28:32.178 --> 28:34.781
well, he'd never provide
the life she deserved,

28:34.781 --> 28:37.416
and Maria, she responded
with forgiveness.

28:38.317 --> 28:39.886
I didn't come to their wedding,

28:41.087 --> 28:45.992
yet they flew to me in
Miami two weeks later

28:47.593 --> 28:49.195
with pictures of their wedding

28:49.195 --> 28:51.931
and a piece of cake.

28:53.232 --> 28:55.501
It was then when I learned

28:55.501 --> 28:59.071
that the heart wants
what the heart wants,

29:00.372 --> 29:01.941
and it can never go wrong,

29:02.942 --> 29:04.944
so I want to make a toast.

29:04.944 --> 29:06.278
I need a drink.

29:06.278 --> 29:10.883
I'd like to make a
toast to my wonderful,

29:10.883 --> 29:13.452
the best sister that
you could ever have,

29:14.486 --> 29:17.023
and the man that I'm so proud

29:17.023 --> 29:18.457
to have in my family now.

29:19.725 --> 29:20.592
I love you guys.

29:20.592 --> 29:22.128
Happy anniversary.

29:22.128 --> 29:24.897
(crowd cheering and applauding)

29:24.897 --> 29:25.998
- Come here.

29:25.998 --> 29:26.933
Come here.

29:26.933 --> 29:27.867
-  Hey, I love you guys.

29:27.867 --> 29:30.602
(speaking in a foreign language)

29:30.602 --> 29:34.273
(upbeat instrumental music)

29:47.719 --> 29:49.288
(laughing)

29:49.288 --> 29:51.157
(singing in a foreign language)

29:51.157 --> 29:51.991
- Are you okay?

29:51.991 --> 29:52.825
- Yeah.

30:02.835 --> 30:06.906
(speaking in a foreign language)

30:13.445 --> 30:16.215
(yelling)

30:16.215 --> 30:17.884
- What the fuck, man?

30:17.884 --> 30:20.052
(yelling)

30:22.188 --> 30:24.156
Fuck is your problem, man?

30:24.156 --> 30:26.392
(grunting and yelling)

30:26.392 --> 30:28.928
- Ow, (speaking in
a foreign language).

30:28.928 --> 30:31.097
(yelling)

30:37.003 --> 30:39.872
(sirens ringing)

30:39.872 --> 30:41.473
(dramatic instrumental music)

30:41.473 --> 30:42.875
- Marcus, Marcus.

30:45.344 --> 30:47.313
-  You're lucky.

30:49.248 --> 30:53.319
(speaking in a foreign language)

30:57.957 --> 30:59.525
- You know, I had to
call in a lot of favors

30:59.525 --> 31:00.426
to let this slide.

31:04.196 --> 31:05.932
Some wrong judge
could easily overlook

31:05.932 --> 31:07.399
your last 10 years,

31:07.399 --> 31:10.202
and you would have ended up
back in here doing time, my boy.

31:11.603 --> 31:14.706
- Yeah, well, you know why
they call it the past, right?

31:16.042 --> 31:17.643
- Give Maria my best.

31:17.643 --> 31:20.579
- I will, and thank you.

31:20.579 --> 31:21.413
- You bet.

31:22.648 --> 31:26.385
(seagulls squawking)

31:26.385 --> 31:27.719
(buzzer ringing)

31:27.719 --> 31:29.989
(mumbling)

31:33.592 --> 31:35.727
- The wife must not
like it anymore.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.964
(laughing)

31:52.444 --> 31:54.280
-  What did
I tell you to do?

31:55.814 --> 31:57.316
- You told me to provoke him.

31:57.316 --> 31:59.651
- Right, not to blindside
him in a parking lot.

32:00.786 --> 32:01.653
- Things just didn't
play out right.

32:01.653 --> 32:02.654
- No, they didn't,

32:02.654 --> 32:03.990
but they're going to next time.

32:03.990 --> 32:05.191
Do you understand me?

32:06.492 --> 32:07.326
- Yes, sir.

32:14.866 --> 32:16.302
- You're gonna come in tonight

32:16.302 --> 32:17.836
and replace again Hadigan
on the night shift.

32:17.836 --> 32:19.238
You make sure as many guards

32:19.238 --> 32:21.940
and prisoners see
you as possible.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.309
Then you're going to disappear

32:23.309 --> 32:24.610
for a couple of hours.

32:27.113 --> 32:28.580
- And then what?

32:28.580 --> 32:31.050
- And then you figure out
how to draw him out properly.

32:31.050 --> 32:32.518
He's got a short fuse, Shane.

32:32.518 --> 32:35.121
All you have to do is light it.

32:36.788 --> 32:41.527
(speaking in a foreign language)

32:41.527 --> 32:44.296
(metal rattling)

32:46.532 --> 32:48.734
(car engine running)

32:48.734 --> 32:51.437
(birds chirping)

34:10.815 --> 34:14.485
(gentle instrumental music)

34:24.362 --> 34:25.731
(glass shattering)

34:25.731 --> 34:28.500
(metal rattling)

34:35.241 --> 34:37.409
(yelling)

34:42.114 --> 34:45.016
(glass shattering)

34:45.984 --> 34:47.319
- It's okay.

34:47.319 --> 34:49.554
(groaning)

34:51.690 --> 34:54.760
(car engine running)

34:57.996 --> 34:59.431
It's okay.

34:59.431 --> 35:00.999
It's okay.

35:00.999 --> 35:01.933
(dog barking)

35:01.933 --> 35:05.937
(speaking in a foreign language)

35:37.336 --> 35:40.572
(yelling and grunting)

36:00.826 --> 36:03.061
(panting)

36:03.061 --> 36:06.732
(gentle instrumental music)

36:11.603 --> 36:14.273
(door creaking)

36:22.281 --> 36:25.050
(metal thudding)

36:40.432 --> 36:43.101
(door creaking)

36:50.442 --> 36:53.512
(electronic beeping)

37:00.519 --> 37:02.454
(buzzer ringing)

37:02.454 --> 37:03.655
- All of the sudden,

37:03.655 --> 37:05.457
he decided to turn
on me, on you.

37:06.692 --> 37:07.626
What would have happened?

37:07.626 --> 37:08.760
I mean, I'd be implicated.

37:10.462 --> 37:11.530
I think I'm so tied to this,

37:11.530 --> 37:13.265
and I just can't--

37:14.333 --> 37:15.267
- Okay, okay, okay.

37:15.267 --> 37:17.202
(speaking in a foreign language)

37:17.202 --> 37:19.137
I promised my sister that
I would take care of you

37:19.137 --> 37:21.407
and not let anything
happen to you, right?

37:21.407 --> 37:22.674
- Yes, you did, but this is--

37:22.674 --> 37:25.277
- And now I'm here
for you, okay?

37:29.114 --> 37:31.817
You went to work tonight, yes?

37:31.817 --> 37:33.018
- Yes.

37:33.018 --> 37:34.185
- You signed in.

37:34.185 --> 37:35.587
- Yes.

37:35.587 --> 37:38.357
(buzzer ringing)

37:39.525 --> 37:41.059
- Did anyone see
you leave earlier?

37:42.494 --> 37:47.132
- No, no, I came through
the back gate, no cameras.

37:48.033 --> 37:48.867
- Good.

37:50.902 --> 37:51.737
Good.

37:53.004 --> 37:54.005
Okay, so,

37:57.643 --> 37:58.844
change into your uniform.

37:58.844 --> 38:00.479
Go back inside.

38:00.479 --> 38:01.480
Talk to the guards.

38:01.480 --> 38:03.014
Make your rounds.

38:03.014 --> 38:04.716
Talk to the prisoners.

38:04.716 --> 38:06.652
Make sure there's as many
witnesses as possible

38:06.652 --> 38:07.653
that you were there.

38:08.954 --> 38:10.756
I will take care of the rest.

38:10.756 --> 38:11.590
- All right.

38:11.590 --> 38:14.526
(insects chirping)

38:21.199 --> 38:22.133
- It's okay.

38:22.133 --> 38:24.903
(buzzer ringing)

38:40.118 --> 38:41.219
(metal thudding)

38:41.219 --> 38:44.890
(gentle instrumental music)

38:49.060 --> 38:51.830
(metal rattling)

39:00.572 --> 39:03.308
(birds chirping)

39:05.143 --> 39:05.977
- Hey, man.

39:07.746 --> 39:09.648
I spoke to Lisa.

39:09.648 --> 39:11.917
She said she'd fly in
if Maria needs her.

39:14.185 --> 39:16.121
(laughing)

39:16.121 --> 39:19.090
(siren ringing)

39:19.090 --> 39:20.859
- This can't be good.

39:24.162 --> 39:24.996
All right, take it easy.

39:24.996 --> 39:25.831
Take it easy.

39:25.831 --> 39:26.965
Whoa, hey, hey, Marcus,

39:28.099 --> 39:32.070
hey, hey, promise me
no matter what happens,

39:32.070 --> 39:33.004
you're gonna take care of her--

39:33.004 --> 39:33.872
- Ain't nothing gonna happen--

39:33.872 --> 39:35.106
- Fucking promise me.

39:35.106 --> 39:38.109
-  (speaking in a
foreign language) Burke.

39:38.109 --> 39:39.445
- I promise.

39:39.445 --> 39:43.081
(gentle instrumental music)

39:43.081 --> 39:43.915
- I love you, bro.

39:43.915 --> 39:44.750
-  Let's go.

39:44.750 --> 39:45.584
- I love you too.

39:45.584 --> 39:46.818
-  Come on.

39:46.818 --> 39:47.719
- My lawyer's number
is on the fridge.

39:47.719 --> 39:48.787
Give him a call.

39:48.787 --> 39:52.691
(speaking in a foreign language)

39:52.691 --> 39:55.427
(metal clicking)

39:57.563 --> 39:59.531
Take care of her, all right?

39:59.531 --> 40:00.365
- I will.

40:04.135 --> 40:06.972
- This guy's head was split
almost in half, Dylan.

40:08.139 --> 40:09.808
Got somebody pretty
pissed off, right?

40:11.209 --> 40:15.847
And your jacket was found
full of his blood, all right,

40:17.182 --> 40:18.784
and then just cavalierly
tossed onto his neighbor's lawn

40:18.784 --> 40:20.552
like, who gives a shit?

40:21.687 --> 40:22.754
-  Well, it wasn't me.

40:22.754 --> 40:24.322
- Somebody who doesn't care.

40:24.322 --> 40:25.156
- It wasn't me.

40:25.156 --> 40:26.324
- Somebody's just--

40:26.324 --> 40:27.425
- My jacket, my
jacket was in my car,

40:27.425 --> 40:28.426
the one that got smashed.

40:28.426 --> 40:29.461
I already told you.

40:29.461 --> 40:30.729
They must have taken it away.

40:30.729 --> 40:32.731
- So you say, but who's they?

40:34.866 --> 40:39.037
(speaking in a foreign language)

40:44.676 --> 40:45.911
- All right, what
about this other guy?

40:45.911 --> 40:47.212
What about this other guy,

40:47.212 --> 40:48.747
the guy that was with
him at the bar, Shane?

40:48.747 --> 40:49.981
Did you find him?

40:49.981 --> 40:51.416
- Yeah, we found Shane.

40:51.416 --> 40:53.819
Shane promised to come
in first thing, man,

40:53.819 --> 40:55.253
right after he
gets off his shift

40:55.253 --> 40:57.255
at the Santiago Prison.

40:57.255 --> 40:58.490
He's a prison guard.

40:59.691 --> 41:01.827
He'll get all the
alibis he needs,

41:03.194 --> 41:04.462
not to mention the fact

41:04.462 --> 41:08.433
that he's the warden's
nephew, Warden Calvin.

41:10.435 --> 41:11.770
- Daniel Calvin.

41:11.770 --> 41:12.604
-  Yeah.

41:15.240 --> 41:16.542
Why?

41:16.542 --> 41:18.944
(gentle instrumental music)

41:18.944 --> 41:23.048
(speaking in a foreign language)

42:13.164 --> 42:16.334
-  I need you
to do me a favor.

42:39.357 --> 42:43.428
(speaking in a foreign language)

42:54.740 --> 42:57.575
(gun firing)

42:57.575 --> 42:59.711
(yelling)

44:51.689 --> 44:53.725
- Signed in at 10:54
p.m. that night,

44:53.725 --> 44:56.327
singed out at 7:15
a.m. the next day,

44:56.327 --> 44:58.163
(yelling)

44:58.163 --> 45:01.032
six guards and
countless prisoners

45:01.032 --> 45:02.333
will testify to that fact,

45:03.735 --> 45:08.639
but there is one testimony
that would refute all of that,

45:15.113 --> 45:18.016
and that is if I testify

45:18.016 --> 45:21.186
that he never actually
signed in that night.

45:24.655 --> 45:27.826
- What do you want
for that testimony?

45:31.930 --> 45:34.800
(metal creaking)

45:34.800 --> 45:38.469
(gentle instrumental music)

45:45.176 --> 45:49.247
(speaking in a foreign language)

46:28.253 --> 46:30.588
So you'll testify your nephew
was out the whole night

46:30.588 --> 46:32.023
and not working as he claims?

46:47.505 --> 46:50.275
(metal creaking)

46:51.309 --> 46:53.478
(humming)

47:17.635 --> 47:20.671
- I loved my wife
more than life itself.

47:20.671 --> 47:22.407
(gentle instrumental music)

47:22.407 --> 47:23.975
I know you can understand that.

47:25.977 --> 47:28.980
(screaming)

47:28.980 --> 47:30.181
I never got to

47:32.317 --> 47:33.818
hold my own child.

47:37.688 --> 47:40.858
That's what your
husband took from me.

47:43.094 --> 47:45.830
(metal creaking)

47:52.837 --> 47:55.573
(metal clicking)

48:05.516 --> 48:09.587
(speaking in a foreign language)

48:44.489 --> 48:47.192
- Does the defense have
any additional witnesses?

48:49.995 --> 48:51.296
- The defense rests.

48:56.367 --> 48:57.535
- You do have one more,

49:01.973 --> 49:04.475
but there is another witness.

49:04.475 --> 49:06.711
(mumbling)

49:08.113 --> 49:11.849
-  Quiet, there
will be order in my court.

49:14.452 --> 49:16.921
(gavel thudding)

49:16.921 --> 49:20.591
(gentle instrumental music)

49:36.807 --> 49:40.911
(speaking in a foreign language)

49:46.651 --> 49:47.652
All rise.

49:52.423 --> 49:53.324
Madam Foreman.

49:59.697 --> 50:01.966
- On the count of murder
in the first degree,

50:03.134 --> 50:05.836
we the jury find the
defendant guilty.

50:05.836 --> 50:09.674
(dramatic instrumental music)

50:12.943 --> 50:15.680
(metal clicking)

50:19.450 --> 50:21.486
-  Love you.

50:21.486 --> 50:23.020
(crying)

50:23.020 --> 50:24.489
-  We'll take
care of her, okay?

50:24.489 --> 50:26.357
We'll take care of her.

50:26.357 --> 50:28.426
(crying)

50:36.867 --> 50:38.436
-  Because of the violent

50:38.436 --> 50:41.606
and premeditated
nature of this crime

50:41.606 --> 50:44.041
coupled with your past
history of violence,

50:45.543 --> 50:48.646
this court condemns you to
death as ordained by law.

50:49.780 --> 50:51.282
You are to hang by the neck

50:51.282 --> 50:53.484
until pronounced dead.

50:53.484 --> 50:57.488
May God grant you
redemption in the next life.

50:57.488 --> 51:00.191
(metal thudding)

51:10.435 --> 51:13.171
(metal creaking)

51:19.009 --> 51:22.680
(gentle instrumental music)

51:33.391 --> 51:36.161
(waves crashing)

51:41.232 --> 51:43.301
(crying)

51:53.911 --> 51:57.948
(speaking in a foreign language)

51:59.617 --> 52:03.354
(dramatic instrumental music)

52:06.657 --> 52:07.692
- Okay.

52:07.692 --> 52:09.260
(yelling)

52:09.260 --> 52:11.729
(choking)

52:11.729 --> 52:14.399
(rope creaking)

52:22.707 --> 52:26.411
(gentle instrumental music)

52:29.780 --> 52:32.450
(wood cracking)

52:54.171 --> 52:55.540
Have them rebuild the gallows.

52:55.540 --> 52:57.475
Let me know when it's done.

53:02.580 --> 53:04.815
(mumbling)

53:06.984 --> 53:09.687
- You must understand
patience, amigo.

53:11.289 --> 53:14.024
I've been here almost 50 years,

53:14.024 --> 53:19.029
and I believe the right
usually triumphs in the end.

53:27.238 --> 53:28.739
(speaking in a foreign language)

53:28.739 --> 53:30.608
- Yes, he told me he would
give me an appointment.

53:32.277 --> 53:36.347
Well, yes, it's very important.

53:36.347 --> 53:39.450
(car engine running)

53:40.418 --> 53:44.955
(speaking in a foreign language)

53:44.955 --> 53:47.224
(mumbling)

53:52.463 --> 53:54.799
(whistling)

53:59.737 --> 54:04.642
- I thought that I was the
baddest man in the penitentiary.

54:05.242 --> 54:06.677
So did he.

54:06.677 --> 54:08.979
(laughing)

54:08.979 --> 54:12.350
They added almost a
year to my sentence

54:12.350 --> 54:15.386
just because of the
fights that took place

54:15.386 --> 54:17.087
because of us.

54:17.087 --> 54:20.858
I hated him like I've
never hated another man,

54:22.660 --> 54:24.261
but when I got out of prison

54:24.261 --> 54:26.030
and I'd served my time,

54:26.030 --> 54:27.598
this man was the only person

54:27.598 --> 54:29.434
standing outside
the gate waiting

54:29.434 --> 54:31.969
with a six pack in one hand

54:31.969 --> 54:33.404
and a handshake in the other.

54:35.205 --> 54:38.976
I should have taken the
offer and joined your crew.

54:38.976 --> 54:40.578
- Yeah, you should have.

54:42.012 --> 54:43.648
- I would have been a fisherman.

54:43.648 --> 54:45.215
(laughing)

54:45.215 --> 54:46.484
- You would have tried.

54:46.484 --> 54:48.719
(laughing)

54:50.421 --> 54:53.424
- How the fuck did
you get back in here?

54:53.424 --> 54:56.060
(mumbling)

54:56.060 --> 55:00.164
(speaking in a foreign language)

55:05.370 --> 55:07.171
- You need to shut it down.

55:07.171 --> 55:08.606
Shut it down now.

55:10.775 --> 55:11.942
Got to find out where
that leak came from.

55:11.942 --> 55:13.511
I thought it was Miguel,

55:13.511 --> 55:15.245
but, okay, I was wrong.

55:16.614 --> 55:17.848
You talk to the governor?

55:18.849 --> 55:21.018
- I will talk to the governor,

55:21.018 --> 55:22.720
but he is always gonna do

55:22.720 --> 55:24.355
what keeps him in the
voters' good graces.

55:24.355 --> 55:25.790
- Well, why would he
give me this job, Ron,

55:25.790 --> 55:27.825
if he doesn't want me to do it?

55:27.825 --> 55:29.059
He's listening to the prisoners.

55:29.059 --> 55:30.695
He's listening to
the protestors.

55:30.695 --> 55:32.029
You understand.

55:32.029 --> 55:33.297
You understand the difficulties

55:33.297 --> 55:35.265
I'm dealing with here, right?

55:35.265 --> 55:37.167
- Yes, I do.

55:37.167 --> 55:39.336
(yelling)

55:40.805 --> 55:42.106
- I'm gonna cut off all the mail

55:42.106 --> 55:43.307
coming in and out of this place

55:43.307 --> 55:44.409
until I find the leak.

55:45.410 --> 55:47.211
(laughing)

55:47.211 --> 55:49.614
- Sir, you can't do that.

55:53.250 --> 55:55.386
If you think things are bad now,

55:55.386 --> 55:58.989
you will become exactly
what the protestors

55:58.989 --> 56:00.691
are saying that you are.

56:00.691 --> 56:02.860
(yelling)

56:04.028 --> 56:06.797
- I'll deal with that
heat when it comes.

56:06.797 --> 56:08.733
(gentle instrumental music)

56:08.733 --> 56:10.501
(singing in a foreign language)

56:10.501 --> 56:12.437
- Anybody here have any
experience with wood?

56:12.437 --> 56:14.071
- Yeah, I do.

56:14.071 --> 56:15.005
- All right.

56:15.005 --> 56:18.142
(singing in a foreign language)

56:18.142 --> 56:19.977
We have to build
this nice and strong

56:19.977 --> 56:22.212
so none of us have to
go like Miguel did.

56:23.347 --> 56:26.116
(metal thudding)

56:37.462 --> 56:38.963
(grunting)

56:38.963 --> 56:42.633
(gentle instrumental music)

56:50.475 --> 56:54.579
(speaking in a foreign language)

57:22.372 --> 57:25.776
- My name is almost at
the top of the list,

57:25.776 --> 57:27.612
so I'm not long for this world.

57:29.213 --> 57:32.082
Every one of those men out there

57:32.082 --> 57:34.018
believe that they've
been wronged in ways

57:34.018 --> 57:34.852
as bad as you.

57:37.722 --> 57:38.823
Don't forget that.

57:41.391 --> 57:43.728
(metal rattling)

57:43.728 --> 57:44.562
Not now.

57:52.670 --> 57:53.938
- No pool table in here,

57:55.606 --> 57:57.908
so I guess I won't get
the chance to get even.

58:03.714 --> 58:04.549
Too bad.

58:06.584 --> 58:08.819
(laughing)

58:12.256 --> 58:13.357
- I know the fight in you.

58:13.357 --> 58:14.191
I've seen it,

58:15.660 --> 58:18.729
but you have to bury that
fight deep inside of you.

58:18.729 --> 58:20.731
You'll get to live long enough

58:20.731 --> 58:22.600
to get the real motherfucker

58:23.668 --> 58:25.703
and not this piece of shit.

58:29.974 --> 58:31.642
(buzzer ringing)

58:31.642 --> 58:34.378
(metal clicking)

58:40.350 --> 58:42.587
(grunting)

58:44.555 --> 58:45.723
(speaking in a foreign language)

58:45.723 --> 58:47.057
- Weapons check.

58:48.559 --> 58:51.495
(metal clattering)

58:56.901 --> 58:59.704
(grunting)

58:59.704 --> 59:02.372
(metal scraping)

59:04.208 --> 59:05.042
What's this?

59:05.943 --> 59:07.144
- You're a little bitch.

59:13.884 --> 59:15.285
(yelling)

59:15.285 --> 59:17.521
(coughing)

59:18.856 --> 59:20.925
- Take him to the
hold, three days.

59:20.925 --> 59:23.160
(growling)

59:25.630 --> 59:27.798
(yelling)

59:29.934 --> 59:32.502
You got something to say to me?

59:34.338 --> 59:35.272
- Patience.

59:42.246 --> 59:43.681
- Cell 93, close.

59:45.616 --> 59:46.884
(metal thudding)

59:46.884 --> 59:49.754
- You planted the same
shank in Burke's cell

59:49.754 --> 59:52.289
that we took off
Rivera a month ago.

59:52.289 --> 59:54.759
It was documented, see?

59:56.193 --> 59:58.395
(speaking in a foreign language)

59:58.395 --> 59:59.797
You're gonna finish
out the week here,

59:59.797 --> 01:00:01.298
and then you're going
to Alabama Correctional.

01:00:01.298 --> 01:00:02.733
You understand me?

01:00:02.733 --> 01:00:04.101
I don't know what
else I can do for you,

01:00:04.101 --> 01:00:05.770
but because I'm your uncle,

01:00:07.237 --> 01:00:09.039
I'm gonna try and
make this go away.

01:00:12.209 --> 01:00:15.045
- You pull all kinds of
strings, don't you, sir?

01:00:15.045 --> 01:00:17.682
(phone clicking)

01:00:17.682 --> 01:00:18.849
- I'm sorry.

01:00:18.849 --> 01:00:19.850
I didn't understand
what you said.

01:00:23.087 --> 01:00:25.389
- All I know is that
Burke's been convicted

01:00:25.389 --> 01:00:27.524
with little evidence,

01:00:27.524 --> 01:00:29.293
so I got to think these strings

01:00:29.293 --> 01:00:30.995
are tied to your hands,

01:00:30.995 --> 01:00:33.197
and now you're
sending me out there,

01:00:33.197 --> 01:00:36.200
the one person who
knows everything you've
done to this man.

01:00:41.205 --> 01:00:42.539
You really trust me, Uncle,

01:00:43.674 --> 01:00:45.175
'cause you're
sending me out there

01:00:45.175 --> 01:00:47.277
with secrets that dare
not find the light of day.

01:00:48.846 --> 01:00:49.646
- Ah hah.

01:00:51.849 --> 01:00:55.185
(speaking in a foreign language)

01:00:55.185 --> 01:00:57.254
- Hope we could still have
dinner like we always do.

01:00:58.889 --> 01:01:03.660
(speaking in a foreign language)

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:05.796
(gentle instrumental music)

01:01:05.796 --> 01:01:08.532
(metal clicking)

01:01:21.211 --> 01:01:22.813
- I see you, Burke.

01:01:28.886 --> 01:01:31.288
See, it's all about time, time.

01:01:35.225 --> 01:01:38.929
Time plays on all of
us in different ways.

01:01:40.664 --> 01:01:43.133
For example, I have
nothing but time.

01:01:43.133 --> 01:01:45.335
You are running out of time.

01:01:45.335 --> 01:01:46.904
Time will make her forget you.

01:01:48.305 --> 01:01:49.406
Enough time goes by,

01:01:51.075 --> 01:01:52.642
she's gonna come
to the realization

01:01:52.642 --> 01:01:55.412
in her own heart
that the best thing

01:01:55.412 --> 01:01:57.414
that she can do is to let you

01:01:57.414 --> 01:01:59.750
and her past go.

01:02:00.951 --> 01:02:02.987
(buzzer ringing)

01:02:02.987 --> 01:02:05.422
She is an extraordinary
woman, Burke,

01:02:08.192 --> 01:02:09.293
but I can't allow her

01:02:09.293 --> 01:02:12.897
to disrupt things here anymore.

01:02:14.531 --> 01:02:17.134
You are going to tell her
to stop what she is doing,

01:02:18.302 --> 01:02:20.905
to forget about you, and
move on with her life

01:02:22.339 --> 01:02:23.407
because if you don't,

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:26.276
I promise you the rest
of your days in here

01:02:26.276 --> 01:02:28.979
will make this month
seem like a vacation.

01:02:37.021 --> 01:02:41.291
- I can never repay what
I took away from you,

01:02:45.095 --> 01:02:48.165
never,

01:02:48.165 --> 01:02:50.234
but I am a different man.

01:02:53.938 --> 01:02:55.840
- Keep telling
yourself that, convict.

01:03:03.981 --> 01:03:06.716
(metal thudding)

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:20.064
(speaking in a foreign language)

01:03:21.531 --> 01:03:22.466
- Burke.

01:03:22.466 --> 01:03:23.200
(speaking in a foreign language)

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:24.134
Burke.

01:03:24.134 --> 01:03:25.936
(speaking in a foreign language)

01:03:25.936 --> 01:03:26.871
Burke.

01:03:26.871 --> 01:03:30.040
(speaking in a foreign language)

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:33.878
(dramatic instrumental music)

01:03:46.290 --> 01:03:47.491
- It has come to my attention

01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:49.259
that some of you are confused

01:03:50.727 --> 01:03:54.364
about who runs this prison.

01:03:56.066 --> 01:04:01.005
I can assure you that
I run this prison.

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:04.274
I am damn sure not going

01:04:04.274 --> 01:04:07.978
to let outside pressure

01:04:07.978 --> 01:04:12.182
determine how things are
done inside these walls.

01:04:13.383 --> 01:04:15.185
From this moment on,

01:04:15.185 --> 01:04:17.888
none of you will be able to send

01:04:17.888 --> 01:04:22.893
or receive anything from
the outside indefinitely

01:04:25.595 --> 01:04:28.899
or till such time as some of you

01:04:28.899 --> 01:04:31.601
get your minds right.

01:04:31.601 --> 01:04:33.870
(mumbling)

01:04:37.207 --> 01:04:39.043
Have I made myself clear?

01:04:39.043 --> 01:04:40.644
-  Yes, sir.

01:04:42.546 --> 01:04:44.781
(mumbling)

01:04:49.987 --> 01:04:52.789
(dice rattling)

01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:56.293
(cheering and whistling)

01:05:28.892 --> 01:05:32.997
(speaking in a foreign language)

01:05:35.632 --> 01:05:38.035
(dice rattling)

01:05:38.035 --> 01:05:41.871
(dramatic instrumental music)

01:06:38.528 --> 01:06:39.363
-  Come on.

01:06:39.363 --> 01:06:43.967
Come on. (yelling)

01:06:46.770 --> 01:06:47.637
Come on.

01:06:47.637 --> 01:06:49.806
(yelling)

01:06:51.241 --> 01:06:55.345
(speaking in a foreign language)

01:07:01.851 --> 01:07:04.121
(cheering)

01:07:24.841 --> 01:07:26.076
(electronic beeping)

01:07:26.076 --> 01:07:29.746
(gentle instrumental music)

01:07:33.850 --> 01:07:35.952
(crying)

01:07:40.924 --> 01:07:45.929
- No, oh, no. (crying)

01:07:46.530 --> 01:07:50.367
No. (crying)

01:07:52.369 --> 01:07:54.938
(rain pouring)

01:07:56.373 --> 01:07:59.309
(thunder rumbling)

01:08:06.450 --> 01:08:07.451
- Ai, Maria.

01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:13.123
I don't know why you keep trying

01:08:13.123 --> 01:08:14.824
to make things so difficult.

01:08:18.995 --> 01:08:20.264
It wasn't so bad, was it,

01:08:21.930 --> 01:08:24.201
our time in that little room?

01:08:26.403 --> 01:08:30.874
(speaking in a foreign language)

01:08:30.874 --> 01:08:31.808
I can feel you shaking,

01:08:31.808 --> 01:08:33.009
so I know you can hear me.

01:08:35.679 --> 01:08:37.581
I couldn't see you living
a decent life with him,

01:08:37.581 --> 01:08:38.715
not after what he took from me.

01:08:38.715 --> 01:08:39.582
I couldn't do it.

01:08:42.886 --> 01:08:43.720
Okay.

01:08:46.523 --> 01:08:50.194
I just need you to tell
me one thing, Maria.

01:08:54.731 --> 01:08:55.564
The baby,

01:08:59.669 --> 01:09:01.705
is it mine, or is it his?

01:09:05.408 --> 01:09:09.479
(speaking in a foreign language)

01:09:12.081 --> 01:09:13.417
(groaning)

01:09:13.417 --> 01:09:17.086
(gentle instrumental music)

01:09:28.265 --> 01:09:30.600
- What else do you want from me?

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:32.602
- I've come to ask
for your forgiveness.

01:09:33.569 --> 01:09:35.104
- Get out of here.

01:09:35.104 --> 01:09:36.273
-  I just need
you to forgive me.

01:09:36.273 --> 01:09:38.341
- Get out of here.

01:09:38.341 --> 01:09:39.776
- No, no, no, no.

01:09:42.912 --> 01:09:43.979
Listen to me.

01:09:46.515 --> 01:09:49.386
There's a lot of
pain and suffering

01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:52.020
that can befall Dylan

01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:54.658
while he waits behind
those tall gray walls

01:09:54.658 --> 01:09:55.892
to swing from the rope.

01:09:57.994 --> 01:10:00.063
(crying)

01:10:02.566 --> 01:10:03.400
Okay.

01:10:06.202 --> 01:10:07.036
Okay.

01:10:11.341 --> 01:10:13.910
(rain pouring)

01:10:15.345 --> 01:10:18.014
(door thudding)

01:10:31.895 --> 01:10:35.265
(metal rattling)

01:10:35.265 --> 01:10:38.535
(grunting and yelling)

01:10:53.817 --> 01:10:55.585
- What happened to Dylan?

01:10:55.585 --> 01:10:59.489
- It's not that he doesn't
want to be here, Ms. Burke.

01:10:59.489 --> 01:11:01.224
- But is he okay?

01:11:01.224 --> 01:11:02.526
- He's all right.

01:11:02.526 --> 01:11:05.395
He's strong, and that's
because he has something

01:11:05.395 --> 01:11:08.365
on the other side of
these walls to hold on to.

01:11:09.766 --> 01:11:13.903
There's nothing more a
man in here could ask for.

01:11:22.646 --> 01:11:25.415
(metal creaking)

01:11:32.389 --> 01:11:33.390
- I'm sorry.

01:11:34.290 --> 01:11:35.659
(metal thudding)

01:11:35.659 --> 01:11:38.562
I'm sorry about
your wife and child.

01:11:38.562 --> 01:11:39.529
I'm sorry.

01:11:42.432 --> 01:11:43.266
I'm sorry.

01:11:48.538 --> 01:11:51.240
(waves crashing)

01:11:53.843 --> 01:11:55.311
- I don't ignore the fact

01:11:55.311 --> 01:11:57.280
that everyone in that
prison has done bad things,

01:11:58.214 --> 01:11:59.583
but hanging a man by a rope

01:11:59.583 --> 01:12:01.551
isn't going to change
anything he's done.

01:12:02.852 --> 01:12:05.622
We must keep fighting
for what is right.

01:12:05.622 --> 01:12:06.890
(speaking in a foreign language)

01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:11.628
- I think we need to put
pressure on both fronts.

01:12:12.996 --> 01:12:16.065
We need to create a public image

01:12:16.065 --> 01:12:18.067
that cannot be denied.

01:12:18.067 --> 01:12:19.703
- And how do we do that exactly?

01:12:20.904 --> 01:12:23.973
At most, we've been
able to take 50 people

01:12:23.973 --> 01:12:25.575
out there at one time.

01:12:25.575 --> 01:12:27.043
(mumbling)

01:12:27.043 --> 01:12:29.779
We need 10 times that
number to make an impact.

01:12:29.779 --> 01:12:31.080
- We get out tomorrow,

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.482
and we work harder.

01:12:32.482 --> 01:12:36.152
(upbeat instrumental music)

01:12:42.792 --> 01:12:46.896
(speaking in a foreign language)

01:13:14.458 --> 01:13:15.659
- Normally I wouldn't
agree to meet

01:13:15.659 --> 01:13:18.094
with anyone who
was threatening me.

01:13:18.094 --> 01:13:19.996
- I'm not threatening
you, Governor.

01:13:19.996 --> 01:13:21.498
I'm just making it clear

01:13:21.498 --> 01:13:23.600
that you have an election
coming up in six months,

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:25.001
and there is a
line of candidates

01:13:25.001 --> 01:13:26.570
who agree that the death penalty

01:13:26.570 --> 01:13:29.072
needs to be reexamined
at the very least.

01:13:30.406 --> 01:13:33.276
- There's no one registered
to run against me.

01:13:33.276 --> 01:13:34.578
- As of now, you're right,

01:13:35.579 --> 01:13:37.080
but six months ago,

01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:40.316
we were only a small chorus
of voices outside the prison.

01:13:40.316 --> 01:13:41.651
Now we are loud enough

01:13:41.651 --> 01:13:44.020
to make it all the
way to your office.

01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:46.623
There are a half
dozen candidates

01:13:46.623 --> 01:13:49.493
calling us to gain our support.

01:13:49.493 --> 01:13:51.928
It's good to have
choices, Governor.

01:13:51.928 --> 01:13:53.329
- And if I were to do this,

01:13:54.864 --> 01:13:56.432
it'll push your support my way.

01:13:58.935 --> 01:14:00.837
- For that, Governor,

01:14:00.837 --> 01:14:03.406
you'd need to cut out
the heart of the problem.

01:14:03.406 --> 01:14:05.575
(yelling)

01:14:07.010 --> 01:14:10.847
Warden Calvin follows the
laws of this land to a tee,

01:14:10.847 --> 01:14:12.616
as far as I understand,

01:14:12.616 --> 01:14:15.218
in an overcrowded and
underfunded prison.

01:14:15.218 --> 01:14:16.052
I'm sorry.

01:14:17.453 --> 01:14:19.523
- I know this man's
character, Governor,

01:14:19.523 --> 01:14:21.124
and the darkness in him.

01:14:22.191 --> 01:14:23.459
I want him fired.

01:14:26.563 --> 01:14:29.733
- You have a lot of gall
walking into my office

01:14:29.733 --> 01:14:32.902
and asking me to
destroy a man's life.

01:14:37.306 --> 01:14:40.243
(metal thudding)

01:14:40.243 --> 01:14:43.012
(paper rustling)

01:14:46.716 --> 01:14:48.317
- Spicy?

01:14:48.317 --> 01:14:49.719
- Spicy as they can make it.

01:14:57.426 --> 01:15:02.198
(speaking in a foreign language)

01:15:02.198 --> 01:15:04.300
- It's been like this
for three weeks now.

01:15:08.071 --> 01:15:10.406
They have protestors
at my summer home.

01:15:11.775 --> 01:15:13.242
- I'm sorry about
that, Governor.

01:15:13.242 --> 01:15:15.344
- You told me we could
weather this storm.

01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:17.681
You didn't tell me this
was gonna be a hurricane.

01:15:17.681 --> 01:15:19.115
- We need to be mindful

01:15:19.115 --> 01:15:21.250
of the will of the people.

01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:22.752
They still believe
in the death penalty.

01:15:22.752 --> 01:15:25.354
- Have you seen
the latest polls?

01:15:25.354 --> 01:15:26.656
(laughing)

01:15:26.656 --> 01:15:27.857
- Polls?

01:15:27.857 --> 01:15:29.292
- That's a crock of shit.

01:15:30.459 --> 01:15:32.929
Because of those
polls, I'm elected,

01:15:32.929 --> 01:15:34.698
and you're appointed
because of the fact

01:15:34.698 --> 01:15:35.932
that I'm elected,

01:15:35.932 --> 01:15:38.101
so I'm sure as hell not
gonna fall on my sword

01:15:38.101 --> 01:15:39.535
over a cause that I happen

01:15:39.535 --> 01:15:41.971
to personally disagree with.

01:15:41.971 --> 01:15:43.640
The people are speaking now,

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:44.874
and if I don't listen,

01:15:44.874 --> 01:15:47.110
I'll be standing next
to the next governor

01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:49.445
as he places his
hand upon the Bible.

01:15:52.081 --> 01:15:55.218
(gentle instrumental music)

01:15:55.218 --> 01:15:57.520
Monday morning, I'm
signing an executive order

01:15:58.421 --> 01:16:00.389
to halt any further executions

01:16:00.389 --> 01:16:03.526
until this matter can
be thoroughly debated

01:16:03.526 --> 01:16:05.128
in the next legislative session.

01:16:07.363 --> 01:16:10.099
- You understand that the men
on death row destroy lives,

01:16:10.099 --> 01:16:12.702
countless lives and families.

01:16:12.702 --> 01:16:15.204
We spend more money to
keep them on death row

01:16:15.204 --> 01:16:17.741
than we spend on public
education for our children.

01:16:22.746 --> 01:16:23.847
Luis, you gave me this job,

01:16:23.847 --> 01:16:24.714
and I'm grateful.

01:16:26.182 --> 01:16:27.851
I've always thought of you
as being an honorable man,

01:16:27.851 --> 01:16:28.985
but sometimes I forget

01:16:30.419 --> 01:16:31.688
you're just a politician.

01:16:38.294 --> 01:16:40.263
- By the end of next week,

01:16:40.263 --> 01:16:42.465
I'll have your transfer
request on my desk.

01:16:48.872 --> 01:16:49.806
- And if I don't?

01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:51.975
- If you cross me on this,

01:16:51.975 --> 01:16:54.010
I will take your
job, your pension,

01:16:54.010 --> 01:16:55.111
and your reputation.

01:16:56.913 --> 01:16:59.082
Daniel, we've been
doing what we do

01:16:59.082 --> 01:17:00.216
for a long time now.

01:17:01.851 --> 01:17:02.852
You've earned a lot.

01:17:04.754 --> 01:17:09.158
Step away from this situation
on your own with dignity.

01:17:11.695 --> 01:17:14.263
Don't do anything that'll make
me take it all away from you

01:17:14.263 --> 01:17:15.431
'cause I will.

01:17:23.106 --> 01:17:25.875
(waves crashing)

01:17:33.082 --> 01:17:35.819
(metal clicking)

01:17:38.187 --> 01:17:40.423
(clapping)

01:17:46.295 --> 01:17:48.765
- Anything you
want from in there.

01:17:55.705 --> 01:17:58.474
(metal thudding)

01:18:44.420 --> 01:18:46.923
- Have you made
your peace with God?

01:18:46.923 --> 01:18:50.593
(gentle instrumental music)

01:18:57.366 --> 01:19:00.103
(waves crashing)

01:19:19.789 --> 01:19:22.291
(mumbling)

01:19:22.291 --> 01:19:23.226
- Hey, hey.

01:19:25.361 --> 01:19:29.632
He's going to order it.

01:19:29.632 --> 01:19:32.435
The governor is ordering
a stay on all executions

01:19:32.435 --> 01:19:34.270
as of Monday morning.

01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:36.539
(cheering)

01:19:37.673 --> 01:19:38.942
We did it.

01:19:38.942 --> 01:19:43.712
We did it. (yelling)

01:19:54.657 --> 01:19:56.860
(upbeat instrumental music)

01:19:56.860 --> 01:19:59.628
(crowd cheering)

01:20:07.436 --> 01:20:10.173
(metal clicking)

01:20:12.608 --> 01:20:16.212
- You probably wondered
why I've asked you here.

01:20:16.212 --> 01:20:17.947
This is the conjugal visit cell

01:20:17.947 --> 01:20:20.216
where we allow prisoners

01:20:20.216 --> 01:20:22.718
to spend intimate
time with their wives.

01:20:23.853 --> 01:20:25.588
Makes them feel
like free men again.

01:20:26.755 --> 01:20:28.757
Your wife will not
be visiting you here,

01:20:28.757 --> 01:20:30.693
although she has been here,

01:20:30.693 --> 01:20:32.862
(yelling)

01:20:40.469 --> 01:20:41.837
but you think about this.

01:20:43.206 --> 01:20:45.108
The baby she's carrying,

01:20:45.108 --> 01:20:47.676
(yelling)

01:20:47.676 --> 01:20:49.712
will it have your eyes or mine?

01:20:51.214 --> 01:20:53.349
(yelling)

01:21:00.423 --> 01:21:02.658
(mumbling)

01:21:09.265 --> 01:21:12.301
- Tonight it's gonna start.

01:21:12.301 --> 01:21:14.503
Men are going to
swing and suffer

01:21:14.503 --> 01:21:16.339
because he lost his fight.

01:21:18.607 --> 01:21:21.244
The men are ready to fight back,

01:21:21.244 --> 01:21:22.946
but they need
themselves a leader.

01:21:24.780 --> 01:21:25.848
They will follow you

01:21:27.216 --> 01:21:29.452
if you are willing to
take one more stand.

01:21:30.386 --> 01:21:32.655
(mumbling)

01:21:53.576 --> 01:21:57.380
(dramatic instrumental music)

01:22:02.251 --> 01:22:05.088
- With executions in Santiago
Prison halting Monday,

01:22:05.088 --> 01:22:07.991
it is clear that hangings
are now in full force.

01:22:07.991 --> 01:22:09.358
They will likely continue

01:22:09.358 --> 01:22:12.861
until the governor's
executive order takes effect.

01:22:12.861 --> 01:22:15.098
(clapping)

01:22:22.305 --> 01:22:23.672
- No.

01:22:23.672 --> 01:22:25.841
(yelling)

01:22:42.191 --> 01:22:43.692
(wood thudding)

01:22:43.692 --> 01:22:45.861
(choking)

01:22:55.504 --> 01:22:57.706
(groaning)

01:22:59.975 --> 01:23:01.510
- We need to get
her to a doctor.

01:23:14.090 --> 01:23:16.759
(water flowing)

01:23:22.965 --> 01:23:27.070
(speaking in a foreign language)

01:23:28.471 --> 01:23:31.107
(electronic beeping)

01:23:31.107 --> 01:23:32.641
Doctor said you
wanted to see me.

01:23:32.641 --> 01:23:33.476
- Yes.

01:23:35.744 --> 01:23:38.914
You have to get something
to Dylan for me, okay?

01:23:38.914 --> 01:23:40.483
You've got to promise to do it.

01:23:42.985 --> 01:23:44.787
- I promise.

01:23:44.787 --> 01:23:48.857
(gentle instrumental music)

01:23:48.857 --> 01:23:52.128
* Tell my love

01:23:52.128 --> 01:23:56.099
* That no matter how far

01:23:56.099 --> 01:24:00.103
* I'll be home in her heart

01:24:00.103 --> 01:24:04.807
* Before too long

01:24:04.807 --> 01:24:08.577
* If I don't

01:24:08.577 --> 01:24:12.081
* Make it alive

01:24:12.081 --> 01:24:16.051
* My dear old shipmate

01:24:16.051 --> 01:24:20.189
* Will make the trip, mate

01:24:20.189 --> 01:24:23.692
* And bring my heart home

01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:28.197
- There's a lot of
bad men in this world.

01:24:29.632 --> 01:24:31.834
Some of them get
what's coming to them,

01:24:32.901 --> 01:24:33.736
and some don't.

01:24:35.638 --> 01:24:38.407
(paper rustling)

01:24:42.778 --> 01:24:44.280
There comes a time

01:24:45.481 --> 01:24:49.252
when a man has to
stand on both his feet

01:24:49.252 --> 01:24:50.886
and give as good as he gets.

01:24:52.355 --> 01:24:55.124
You and me, we ain't long
for this world, my friend,

01:24:57.426 --> 01:24:58.327
but if we go out fighting

01:24:58.327 --> 01:24:59.628
for what we believe in,

01:25:01.464 --> 01:25:02.831
then we won already.

01:25:14.610 --> 01:25:17.380
(paper rustling)

01:25:50.012 --> 01:25:52.848
(metal rattling)

01:26:03.025 --> 01:26:04.193
- Look at her.

01:26:10.933 --> 01:26:12.568
Those are your eyes.

01:26:23.279 --> 01:26:24.480
Here.

01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:28.317
(dramatic instrumental music)

01:26:33.322 --> 01:26:35.057
(metal thudding)

01:26:35.057 --> 01:26:36.659
(singing)

01:26:36.659 --> 01:26:38.994
(clapping)

01:26:38.994 --> 01:26:40.796
* Make it alive

01:26:40.796 --> 01:26:44.900
* My dear old shipmate
will make the trip, dear *

01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:48.804
* Tell my love that
no matter how far *

01:26:48.804 --> 01:26:52.841
* I'll home in her
arms before too long *

01:26:52.841 --> 01:26:56.712
* If I don't make it alive

01:26:56.712 --> 01:27:00.849
* My dear old shipmate
will take the trip, dear *

01:27:00.849 --> 01:27:03.686
(yelling and clapping)

01:27:03.686 --> 01:27:08.524
* The devil sea is a
place I've heard tell *

01:27:08.524 --> 01:27:10.693
(yelling)

01:27:12.094 --> 01:27:16.599
* Soul disappears
and as to this song *

01:27:17.733 --> 01:27:19.502
- You're in this
God forsaken prison

01:27:19.502 --> 01:27:21.870
because of the crimes
that you committed.

01:27:23.806 --> 01:27:25.040
Every single one of you

01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:27.175
walked yourselves
through these doors.

01:27:30.279 --> 01:27:32.080
I'll string enough of you up,

01:27:33.549 --> 01:27:36.319
so they have to cut all
you sons of bitches down.

01:27:37.152 --> 01:27:38.887
Do you understand me?

01:27:43.125 --> 01:27:45.528
I said, do you understand me?

01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:53.502
(clapping)

01:27:53.502 --> 01:27:57.340
(dramatic instrumental music)

01:28:04.380 --> 01:28:05.548
That's enough.

01:28:08.717 --> 01:28:10.886
(yelling)

01:28:13.021 --> 01:28:14.189
That's enough.

01:28:15.958 --> 01:28:20.062
(speaking in a foreign language)

01:28:25.167 --> 01:28:27.336
(yelling)

01:28:58.100 --> 01:28:59.101
You want it.

01:28:59.968 --> 01:29:03.171
(grunting and yelling)

01:29:20.556 --> 01:29:23.325
- There's a fucking
riot in the prison.

01:29:23.325 --> 01:29:24.893
Elliot, get the fuck out.

01:29:24.893 --> 01:29:25.961
- I don't care, man.

01:29:25.961 --> 01:29:28.130
(yelling)

01:30:01.497 --> 01:30:04.166
(bone cracking)

01:30:14.577 --> 01:30:17.680
(metal clicking)

01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:20.883
(gun cocking)

01:30:20.883 --> 01:30:22.518
(gun firing)

01:30:22.518 --> 01:30:25.287
(buzzer ringing)

01:30:28.491 --> 01:30:30.258
- Hey, you okay?

01:30:30.258 --> 01:30:31.093
You okay?

01:30:31.093 --> 01:30:32.528
- Yeah, I'm okay.

01:30:32.528 --> 01:30:34.497
(yelling)

01:30:34.497 --> 01:30:38.333
(dramatic instrumental music)

01:30:42.671 --> 01:30:45.541
(metal shattering)

01:30:47.075 --> 01:30:50.278
(grunting and yelling)

01:31:18.140 --> 01:31:22.344
- Calvin.

01:31:22.344 --> 01:31:23.178
- Dylan.

01:31:26.048 --> 01:31:29.417
(dramatic instrumental music)

01:31:29.417 --> 01:31:30.252
- Calvin.

01:32:02.517 --> 01:32:05.754
(yelling and grunting)

01:33:27.602 --> 01:33:29.772
(choking)

01:33:42.350 --> 01:33:44.519
(panting)

01:33:58.566 --> 01:34:01.103
(water pouring)

01:34:01.103 --> 01:34:02.504
(yelling)

01:34:02.504 --> 01:34:06.174
(gentle instrumental music)

01:34:42.110 --> 01:34:43.712
She's so beautiful,

01:34:45.013 --> 01:34:46.114
so beautiful.

01:34:52.554 --> 01:34:55.323
(waves crashing)

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.002
(wood thudding)

01:35:07.002 --> 01:35:09.671
(wood creaking)

01:35:14.109 --> 01:35:16.278
(gasping)

01:35:19.214 --> 01:35:22.885
(gentle instrumental music)

01:35:53.949 --> 01:35:56.118
(yelling)

01:36:09.264 --> 01:36:12.000
(bomb exploding)

01:36:19.574 --> 01:36:22.377
(gentle instrumental music)

01:36:22.377 --> 01:36:24.980
(wind blowing)

01:36:43.531 --> 01:36:47.602
(speaking in a foreign language)

01:37:09.657 --> 01:37:13.161
(waves crashing)

01:37:13.161 --> 01:37:14.863
-  Lifelong
man of the sea?

01:37:17.132 --> 01:37:19.267
- Well, only the
last half of my life,

01:37:20.135 --> 01:37:21.636
so I'm still learning.

01:37:21.636 --> 01:37:23.505
(laughing)

01:37:23.505 --> 01:37:25.173
- My name is Anita.

01:37:25.173 --> 01:37:26.008
(speaking in a foreign language)

01:37:26.008 --> 01:37:27.575
I own this little place,

01:37:27.575 --> 01:37:28.977
well, with my mom.

01:37:36.651 --> 01:37:38.686
- I worked at the prison
for a short while.

01:37:44.626 --> 01:37:45.860
-  I need
to get to my work.

01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:47.329
- Then I should
give you this now.

01:37:50.432 --> 01:37:52.534
(paper rustling)

01:37:52.534 --> 01:37:53.568
I was the last man to speak

01:37:53.568 --> 01:37:55.070
to your father before he died,

01:37:56.838 --> 01:37:58.440
and he asked me to give you this

01:37:59.607 --> 01:38:01.076
when I thought the
time was right.

01:38:01.076 --> 01:38:04.746
(gentle instrumental music)

01:38:06.915 --> 01:38:07.815
The time is right.

01:38:11.086 --> 01:38:11.920
Please.

01:38:30.638 --> 01:38:32.207
My sweet Anita,

01:38:33.475 --> 01:38:36.844
please know that my
heart overflows for you,

01:38:36.844 --> 01:38:40.248
but my words are limited to
this single sheet of old paper.

01:38:40.248 --> 01:38:42.951
That regret I feel that I
will never see you in person

01:38:43.918 --> 01:38:45.553
is only replaced
by the knowledge

01:38:45.553 --> 01:38:47.622
that you have been
raised by Maria Burke.

01:38:49.757 --> 01:38:51.193
She was my lighthouse.

01:38:53.828 --> 01:38:56.431
I'm sure she told you only
the good things about me,

01:38:57.765 --> 01:38:59.734
but know there was
also much bad in me.

01:39:02.637 --> 01:39:04.806
That's the same for
all of us in this life,

01:39:06.874 --> 01:39:09.177
so whomever comes your way,

01:39:09.177 --> 01:39:10.412
understand that
they're struggling

01:39:10.412 --> 01:39:13.281
between who they are
and who they could be.

01:39:15.483 --> 01:39:16.318
- I'm sorry.

01:39:17.785 --> 01:39:18.620
- Smile.

01:39:20.055 --> 01:39:21.789
See the best in them.

01:39:21.789 --> 01:39:23.458
That'll often be enough

01:39:23.458 --> 01:39:25.560
to help a man find
his best self.

01:39:26.828 --> 01:39:27.895
There are good people,

01:39:27.895 --> 01:39:29.431
even in the darkest places.

01:39:30.498 --> 01:39:32.500
If you're reading this letter,

01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:33.501
then you have proof.

01:39:35.037 --> 01:39:36.071
(speaking in a foreign language)

01:39:36.071 --> 01:39:38.173
If I have learned anything,

01:39:38.173 --> 01:39:39.441
it's to forgive so that you

01:39:39.441 --> 01:39:41.076
can go forward a little lighter.

01:39:43.745 --> 01:39:44.912
My dear Anita,

01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:54.822
if you ever feel fear,

01:39:54.822 --> 01:39:55.890
just move forward

01:39:57.192 --> 01:39:58.993
'cause I am behind you, and,

01:40:02.230 --> 01:40:06.301
if you ever feel a
cool water breeze

01:40:07.202 --> 01:40:08.170
kissing your heart,

01:40:10.672 --> 01:40:12.774
that is because you are
wrapped tightly in my arms

01:40:12.774 --> 01:40:14.176
for that brief moment.

01:40:16.278 --> 01:40:17.179
I love you.

01:40:18.513 --> 01:40:20.014
I love your mother

01:40:21.683 --> 01:40:22.784
forever.

01:40:22.784 --> 01:40:25.187
(waves crashing)

01:40:25.187 --> 01:40:27.889
(gentle instrumental music)

01:40:27.889 --> 01:40:31.993
(speaking in a foreign language)

01:41:37.192 --> 01:41:39.794
(wind blowing)

01:41:41.929 --> 01:41:45.600
(gentle instrumental music)

01:42:02.150 --> 01:42:07.155
* If only I knew how

01:42:08.923 --> 01:42:12.627
* To break my hard

01:42:12.627 --> 01:42:17.632
* Armor down

01:42:18.266 --> 01:42:21.536
* I long

01:42:21.536 --> 01:42:26.107
* To let you know

01:42:26.107 --> 01:42:31.112
* How I adore

01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:35.550
* When you pull
me in like this *

01:42:35.550 --> 01:42:40.555
* Like I'm the only

01:42:41.723 --> 01:42:44.459
* One you need

01:42:44.459 --> 01:42:49.063
* I breathe you in

01:42:49.063 --> 01:42:53.735
* I feel you up
against my skin *

01:42:53.735 --> 01:42:58.573
* And now I know

01:42:58.573 --> 01:43:02.644
* I give in to you

01:43:02.644 --> 01:43:07.249
* You've got me hooked

01:43:07.249 --> 01:43:11.786
* You take me higher than

01:43:11.786 --> 01:43:16.458
* I've ever been

01:43:16.458 --> 01:43:20.828
* You take me higher than

01:43:20.828 --> 01:43:25.700
* I've ever been

01:43:25.700 --> 01:43:30.071
* You take me higher than

01:43:30.071 --> 01:43:34.809
* I've ever been

01:43:34.809 --> 01:43:39.381
* I feel you up
against my skin *

01:43:39.381 --> 01:43:44.319
* And now I know

01:43:44.319 --> 01:43:48.456
* I give in to you

01:43:48.456 --> 01:43:53.160
* You've got me hooked

01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:57.565
* You take me higher than

01:43:57.565 --> 01:44:02.069
* I've ever been

01:44:02.069 --> 01:44:06.641
* You take me higher than

01:44:06.641 --> 01:44:09.411
* I've ever been
