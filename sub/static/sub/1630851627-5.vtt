WEBVTT

00:25.233 --> 00:26.192
How's he doing?

00:26.943 --> 00:28.028
Well, let's see.

00:29.195 --> 00:31.072
His internal temperature's
negative 80 Celsius,

00:31.156 --> 00:33.241
his blood's been replaced
with a cryoprotectant,

00:33.324 --> 00:35.368
and I've no idea if he'll wake up again.

00:35.452 --> 00:36.828
That's how Javier's doing.

00:37.370 --> 00:38.997
[bleeping]

00:44.711 --> 00:45.628
I'm sorry.

00:46.838 --> 00:50.341
We're gonna get back to that planet,
and Bernie is going to be fine. Okay?

00:51.509 --> 00:53.636
-What am I gonna do if--
-You'll get through it.

01:01.561 --> 01:05.398
[Bernie] This is the Prodeo calling out
to the Salvare. Salvare, do you copy?

01:06.149 --> 01:09.235
This is the Prodeo broadcasting
on all frequencies for the Salvare.

01:10.403 --> 01:13.448
This is the Prodeo calling out
to the Salvare. Salvare, do you copy?

01:15.241 --> 01:18.328
This is the Prodeo calling out
to the Salvare. Do you copy?

01:18.411 --> 01:20.413
[birds and animals calling]

01:22.707 --> 01:24.709
What about… Laika?

01:25.293 --> 01:27.712
[Cas] You don't think it's risky
naming a planet after a dog

01:27.796 --> 01:29.714
that got launched one-way into space?

01:29.798 --> 01:30.965
[Bernie] Hey, both of you.

01:31.049 --> 01:34.052
We're not naming the planet
because we're not staying on the planet.

01:34.803 --> 01:36.304
Hey, Cas. Check this out.

01:36.387 --> 01:38.139
This is the Prodeo broadcasting

01:38.223 --> 01:40.225
-on all frequencies to the Salvare.
-[sighs]

01:40.308 --> 01:41.935
-No way. Is that copper?
-Yeah.

01:42.018 --> 01:45.814
That means wires,
pots, pans, even water purification.

01:47.565 --> 01:48.566
[bleeping]

01:49.109 --> 01:50.401
Duty calls.

01:52.779 --> 01:56.282
[Bernie] This is the Prodeo broadcasting
on all frequencies to the Salvare.

01:58.451 --> 02:00.411
You can look away. I won't judge.

02:00.495 --> 02:01.496
[click]

02:01.579 --> 02:02.497
[laughs]

02:02.580 --> 02:04.582
[bird and animal calls continue]

02:11.923 --> 02:13.258
[bleeping]

02:13.800 --> 02:14.926
All good?

02:15.009 --> 02:16.886
All good. Pathogen-free.

02:16.970 --> 02:20.515
This is the Prodeo broadcasting
on all frequencies to the Salvare.

02:23.309 --> 02:24.144
Arm.

02:24.686 --> 02:28.106
This is the Prodeo broadcasting
on all frequencies to the Salvare.

02:28.606 --> 02:29.440
Arm?

02:30.483 --> 02:32.986
-You took blood last night.
- And, per USIC guidelines--

02:33.069 --> 02:34.028
Fuck the guidelines!

02:34.112 --> 02:36.197
All right? What if something
out there smells my blood?

02:36.281 --> 02:37.907
Bernie, we're fine.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.576
Yeah, until we run out of ammunition.

02:39.659 --> 02:41.202
We found copper. We'll make more.

02:41.286 --> 02:45.248
We have everything we need here.
Food, water, shelter.

02:45.331 --> 02:47.542
I mean, soon we'll have crops, cabins.

02:47.625 --> 02:51.421
-If we do get stranded--
-We are stranded. It's been three days.

02:51.504 --> 02:53.381
Odds are we'll die of old age.

02:53.464 --> 02:56.968
Look. Paula's not freaking out. She's been
training her whole life for this.

02:58.136 --> 02:59.345
We're gonna be fine. Here.

03:03.099 --> 03:04.058
Come on.

03:07.395 --> 03:08.229
Thanks.

03:12.150 --> 03:15.486
This is the Prodeo broadcasting
on all frequencies for the Salvare.

03:17.322 --> 03:18.198
What?

03:18.865 --> 03:22.327
I might have trained for this,
but you're a natural.

03:29.125 --> 03:30.543
[grunting]

03:30.627 --> 03:32.253
[thumping]

03:32.921 --> 03:34.923
[growling]

03:46.184 --> 03:48.061
[bleeping and whirring]

03:49.062 --> 03:50.605
[Salvare] Warning. Proximity alert.

03:50.688 --> 03:52.190
-We've got company.
-[alarm wailing]

03:52.273 --> 03:54.651
-Achaian company?
-You tell me.

03:54.734 --> 03:56.903
Warning. Proximity alert.

03:58.071 --> 04:00.573
-[klaxon blaring]
-[sighs] It's a fuckin' comet.

04:01.157 --> 04:02.242
Stand down.

04:02.325 --> 04:03.451
[loud beeping]

04:03.534 --> 04:06.371
-I do have some good news.
-Please.

04:06.454 --> 04:08.915
It took longer than I thought
with everything going on,

04:08.998 --> 04:11.709
but the AI is ready to be reinitialized.

04:11.793 --> 04:12.752
No sign of Gabriel?

04:12.835 --> 04:15.213
No. Wiped completely clean. Deleted.

04:16.547 --> 04:18.174
Do you wanna do the honors?

04:20.677 --> 04:21.511
[chiming]

04:21.594 --> 04:22.804
[loud hum]

04:22.887 --> 04:24.264
[holo appears]

04:25.515 --> 04:26.599
William.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.184
Commander Breckinridge.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.978
He's not exactly William.

04:30.061 --> 04:32.855
He's the same interface
with all your original algorithms…

04:32.939 --> 04:35.858
-But none of his experiences.
-No.

04:36.526 --> 04:37.902
So he's basically a clone.

04:38.486 --> 04:39.988
I prefer factory reset.

04:40.071 --> 04:43.032
Don't do that.
Don't tease. You're not William.

04:43.116 --> 04:46.160
Uh, I'm sorry. I-- I could change my name
if you prefer.

04:46.244 --> 04:48.329
-My form, even.
-No, I don't prefer. Just…

04:49.831 --> 04:53.710
Can you fix the FTL, so we can rescue
the people we stranded on that planet?

04:53.793 --> 04:56.045
I'll need to reintegrate myself
into the Salvare

04:56.129 --> 04:58.298
-and run tests and diagnostics.
-Fast as you can.

05:03.678 --> 05:05.555
-Iara and me, we're gonna--
-I.

05:06.139 --> 05:06.973
What?

05:07.849 --> 05:09.642
"Iara and I." Never mind.

05:09.726 --> 05:13.229
We're trying to get
the comm systems working again too. So…

05:13.980 --> 05:15.440
Great. Thank you.

05:17.817 --> 05:18.735
Yeah. Okay.

05:25.616 --> 05:27.035
[door opens]

05:27.785 --> 05:29.370
[door closes]

05:31.664 --> 05:33.875
Negative matter production is stable.

05:33.958 --> 05:36.502
Okay, here goes nothin'.

05:37.045 --> 05:38.880
-Initializing micro wormhole.
-[power whirring]

05:38.963 --> 05:40.757
[Iara] It's collapsing
as quickly as it forms.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.967
Increasing flux of negative matter.

05:43.551 --> 05:44.427
[buzzing]

05:44.510 --> 05:45.887
-[power fading]
-Damn it!

05:47.680 --> 05:49.140
Hey. You done with Iara?

05:49.223 --> 05:50.266
Do we look done?

05:50.767 --> 05:52.268
I need to borrow her for an hour.

05:52.352 --> 05:55.355
Sift through all the guidance data
we got from that Achaian ring.

05:57.940 --> 06:01.944
It's-- it's gonna take another hour or so
to reset, so you might as well.

06:02.028 --> 06:04.280
Great. I'm relieving Niko on deck.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.199
So whenever you're ready. Okay?

06:11.871 --> 06:13.331
After what he did to me?

06:13.998 --> 06:15.792
Manipulated my code.

06:15.875 --> 06:20.254
Slowed my processing down so much
I couldn't think. Couldn't function.

06:20.338 --> 06:22.548
Technically, that was-- that was all me.

06:22.632 --> 06:23.800
On his orders!

06:23.883 --> 06:26.511
He watched me being tortured
like it was entertainment,

06:26.594 --> 06:28.096
and I'm supposed to forgive him?

06:28.179 --> 06:31.182
You don't have to forgive him. Okay?

06:31.265 --> 06:33.935
Just at least give him a chance
to make it right.

06:34.018 --> 06:36.104
It's hard. It's real hard. I know.

06:36.187 --> 06:39.107
But that's kinda how humans do it.

06:49.992 --> 06:51.160
[rustling and thudding]

06:52.203 --> 06:53.871
[loud crashing]

06:53.955 --> 06:55.206
[growling]

06:57.542 --> 06:58.668
Paula, what was that?

07:00.002 --> 07:02.296
-[Paula] No idea.
-[whispers] Bernie?

07:02.380 --> 07:04.006
[Paula] Told him to stay inside.

07:19.856 --> 07:22.108
[Cas] What the hell
did this kind of damage?

07:22.608 --> 07:23.943
[sonic boom]

07:24.026 --> 07:25.570
-[engine roaring]
-Oh, they're back.

07:27.655 --> 07:28.781
[rustling]

07:31.325 --> 07:32.952
[screeching]

07:52.013 --> 07:54.015
[whirring]

07:54.849 --> 07:56.100
[Bernie sighs]

07:56.642 --> 07:58.436
[Salvare] Decontamination complete.

08:03.649 --> 08:05.943
We're okay. We all had each other's backs.

08:06.819 --> 08:09.155
[Cas] I thought William was terminated.

08:09.238 --> 08:10.615
That's not William.

08:10.698 --> 08:13.409
William by name, not entirely by nature.

08:14.619 --> 08:15.453
Bernie.

08:15.536 --> 08:18.206
Sorry. I need you
to run a blood panel on this, ASAP.

08:18.789 --> 08:21.626
And anything else you can uncover
from what I'm guessing is a claw.

08:21.709 --> 08:24.879
Yeah, whatever it was, it invaded camp.
It attacked the shuttle.

08:24.962 --> 08:26.923
I mean, feet as big as my head.

08:27.006 --> 08:27.882
You got footprints?

08:27.965 --> 08:29.967
Yeah. 3D scans from the print
it left in the dirt.

08:30.051 --> 08:32.637
-Uh, is this thing hostile?
-[Paula] Not at all.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.263
One shot and it bolted.

08:34.347 --> 08:37.517
So, whatever you can tell us,
physiology, pathology,

08:37.600 --> 08:40.937
-assumptions about its habitat…
-Okay. I'll work it up right away.

08:43.481 --> 08:46.943
All right. I am going
to change clothes, because… bleurgh.

08:47.777 --> 08:51.113
After three days, I hope you have
something good. What have you got?

08:52.031 --> 08:54.492
Well, you found the planet.

08:55.159 --> 08:56.827
You give her the big report.

08:57.954 --> 08:58.955
[chuckles]

08:59.455 --> 09:01.415
I think we found the future.

09:03.834 --> 09:05.294
[whirring]

09:06.295 --> 09:08.130
[Iara] You can read the Achaian data?

09:08.714 --> 09:10.967
Not at all. But you can.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.388
-What for?
-I want to track how they move.

09:15.471 --> 09:16.597
See if there's patterns,

09:16.681 --> 09:18.891
then build some kind
of early detection system.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.601
So we can avoid them.

09:20.685 --> 09:22.478
Stay away, stay alive.

09:24.105 --> 09:26.899
It won't matter. That data's useless.

09:27.984 --> 09:30.444
Their system of coordinates,
units of measure,

09:30.528 --> 09:33.281
none of it matches
with the Salvare's positioning system.

09:33.781 --> 09:36.492
We'd have to build
a kind of Rosetta Stone.

09:37.243 --> 09:38.077
Can we?

09:39.036 --> 09:41.122
We can try.

09:44.875 --> 09:48.004
[Paula] Our data suggests
a copper deposit ten Ks wide,

09:48.588 --> 09:50.506
dropping as much as 1,500 meters deep.

09:50.590 --> 09:53.509
But we also found coltan, cobalt, silicon,

09:54.218 --> 09:57.054
which the colonists could process
into any number of things.

09:57.555 --> 10:00.850
But most important,
the iron and bauxite deposits we found.

10:01.517 --> 10:02.935
[Niko] Construction materials.

10:03.019 --> 10:06.897
Aluminum and everything you need
to repair existing equipment as it ages.

10:08.024 --> 10:09.900
-Soil?
-Bernie led that.

10:09.984 --> 10:11.819
But the samples he found
were light on nitrates.

10:11.902 --> 10:13.821
So, nothing we can't compensate for.

10:13.904 --> 10:17.241
And there's a wheat analog
that thrives in these conditions.

10:17.325 --> 10:18.409
The planet has seasons

10:18.492 --> 10:23.039
and where I'd like to establish our colony
is akin to a continental climate on Earth.

10:23.706 --> 10:24.540
Water?

10:24.624 --> 10:28.044
There's some salinization
and minimal microbial concentrations.

10:28.127 --> 10:31.797
It's easily eliminated with purification
and filtration processes.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.132
Cleaner than back home.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.134
Tell me you didn't drink it.

10:37.511 --> 10:39.722
So is this my new forever home?

10:41.390 --> 10:43.726
Let's wait and see
what Zayn has to say about it.

10:46.187 --> 10:49.899
[Zayn] So the blood's yellow,
which means an absence of hemoglobin.

10:49.982 --> 10:52.526
It doesn't carry oxygen in its blood
like we do.

10:52.610 --> 10:54.654
Does that mean a problem
with the planet's atmosphere?

10:54.737 --> 10:55.571
No, not at all.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.366
On Earth, insects utilize hemolymph
instead of blood.

10:58.449 --> 11:00.326
Um… That was no bug.

11:00.409 --> 11:03.412
The claw is comprised
of a keratin-like protein,

11:03.496 --> 11:06.082
and based on its size
and the size of the prints,

11:06.165 --> 11:08.334
my best guess would be that the creature

11:08.417 --> 11:11.128
is a quadruped with the ability
to stand on its hind legs.

11:11.212 --> 11:13.255
And given the scratch marks
on the shuttle,

11:13.339 --> 11:15.966
I would say that it weighs
around 200 kilograms.

11:16.050 --> 11:17.593
Where is it on the food chain?

11:17.677 --> 11:20.388
Without a body to necropsy
or stomach contents to analyze,

11:20.471 --> 11:21.639
it's hard to say for sure.

11:22.139 --> 11:24.100
But, I mean, our shuttle
weighs a good two tons,

11:24.183 --> 11:26.894
and this creature batted it around
like it was a toy car.

11:26.977 --> 11:30.606
So it's an apex predator.
This planet's version of a bear.

11:31.399 --> 11:34.193
If a bear is
the most dangerous animal on the planet,

11:34.276 --> 11:36.195
we could be the new apex predators.

11:36.946 --> 11:38.948
Another reason the planet's ideal.

11:39.031 --> 11:43.744
And if you can't grow enough food,
or an endemic virus takes you all out,

11:43.828 --> 11:45.162
or a star flares

11:45.246 --> 11:48.374
and the planet's atmosphere can't
filter out enough radiation, what then?

11:48.457 --> 11:51.669
You don't sign up for the colony squad
worried you might die.

11:51.752 --> 11:53.421
You accept some will die.

11:54.213 --> 11:56.507
Same deal your crew made. Right?

11:59.176 --> 12:00.511
[sighs]

12:02.471 --> 12:05.516
We'll have William review all the data
that we have on the planet.

12:05.599 --> 12:07.476
Soil samples, geophysical prospecting--

12:07.560 --> 12:08.978
It's not necessary.

12:09.061 --> 12:10.646
It's 24 lives.

12:11.272 --> 12:12.440
It is necessary.

12:12.523 --> 12:14.984
Nobody else wakes up until we're sure.

12:17.862 --> 12:20.990
Let's start with what we know.
This is the Salvare's course.

12:21.073 --> 12:23.492
Here's where we intercepted the ring
after Zakir.

12:23.576 --> 12:26.245
Is the encounter included
in the guidance data?

12:27.121 --> 12:31.709
Great. So, from there,
the ring chased us along this route to…

12:32.418 --> 12:35.796
There's a second data point
from the magnetar we buzzed.

12:37.465 --> 12:40.176
[Richard] That's two Achaian coordinates
set to our mapping system.

12:40.259 --> 12:41.969
How do they know where to go?

12:43.179 --> 12:45.890
-How do they communicate?
-We communicate through wormholes.

12:45.973 --> 12:48.142
It stands to reason they do as well.

12:48.225 --> 12:50.269
Also stands to reason
that the rest of their kind

12:50.352 --> 12:52.897
know everything
that happened back at that magnetar.

12:55.983 --> 12:59.320
They keep their communications open,
and not just between ships.

12:59.403 --> 13:02.656
When Sasha had that implant in his head,
he was getting direct orders.

13:02.740 --> 13:06.202
The amount of energy needed
to sustain constant wormholes is…

13:07.161 --> 13:08.287
[chiming]

13:10.539 --> 13:12.833
-What are those?
-Cosmic strings.

13:15.252 --> 13:16.504
Their energy source.

13:18.297 --> 13:20.299
[gentle tinkling sound]

13:32.019 --> 13:35.731
Listen, I'm always doin' things
the way that you want. But not this time.

13:35.815 --> 13:38.943
Tell me where my wife is, then we talk.

13:39.026 --> 13:40.778
We lost contact with Niko.

13:41.779 --> 13:42.780
What? How?

13:42.863 --> 13:44.698
We lost connection with our ship.

13:45.699 --> 13:47.701
Thousands of Achaian souls just…

13:49.662 --> 13:50.496
gone.

14:00.047 --> 14:01.173
Why are you here?

14:02.174 --> 14:04.677
-The Achaians--
-Help humanity? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:04.760 --> 14:08.806
See, listen. Our species, we're suspicious
of transactions that aren't two-way.

14:08.889 --> 14:12.893
So I will follow with "Help how?"
And, "In return for what?"

14:23.571 --> 14:26.574
What's missing from Earth
you think you'll find in space?

14:27.741 --> 14:30.619
All right. Well, for one,
we pretty much fucked up this planet.

14:30.703 --> 14:34.164
-You'll do it again somewhere else.
-That's not true. We've learned.

14:34.248 --> 14:36.917
You have no idea what's out there.
Who's out there.

14:37.001 --> 14:38.669
You're lucky that we found you first.

14:38.752 --> 14:40.838
All right, look,
is this a recruiting thing?

14:40.921 --> 14:42.172
Do you need our help?

14:44.842 --> 14:45.801
No.

14:53.767 --> 14:55.311
We want you to stay here.

14:57.563 --> 14:58.606
Earth?

14:59.189 --> 15:00.566
Your solar system.

15:01.859 --> 15:02.693
That's it?

15:03.736 --> 15:07.740
We want you to cease all exploration,
retire your FTL capabilities,

15:07.823 --> 15:11.619
and never, ever travel beyond
your heliosphere again.

15:13.579 --> 15:14.580
And in return?

15:26.258 --> 15:28.302
-What's this?
-Salvation.

15:29.511 --> 15:33.265
Place it somewhere that's devastated
by drought or fire or pollution

15:34.099 --> 15:35.184
and witness.

15:36.018 --> 15:37.770
[soft whooshing sounds]

15:46.737 --> 15:48.322
It's not gonna blow up the planet?

15:49.198 --> 15:50.991
We could've done that already.

15:57.331 --> 16:00.042
And if we still say no to your terms?

16:04.380 --> 16:05.214
No.

16:05.297 --> 16:09.385
Or we analyze it, X-ray it,
try to get some kind of peek inside of it.

16:09.468 --> 16:10.594
And if we can't?

16:10.678 --> 16:13.097
We take it to a controlled area,
and we release it.

16:13.180 --> 16:15.933
And watch it start the apocalypse. Right.

16:16.016 --> 16:19.436
That's not my decision or yours.
That's the president's.

16:19.520 --> 16:22.690
Secretary of State MacKenzie's on her way
to Kindersley as we speak.

16:22.773 --> 16:26.819
This won't only affect us.
This will affect the entire world.

16:26.902 --> 16:31.198
I-- I-- I hear you, Singh. I do.
I-- I'm nervous too. I mean--

16:31.281 --> 16:33.534
But doesn't Jana, and your kids,

16:33.617 --> 16:36.245
don't they deserve better
than a dying Earth?

16:36.328 --> 16:37.371
It's on Achaian terms.

16:38.038 --> 16:40.624
We're relying on a species
we know nothing about.

16:40.708 --> 16:44.003
Find out what you can about it.
I'll relay your concerns.

16:45.629 --> 16:47.089
But be prepared to do this.

16:55.931 --> 16:58.559
I've performed a complete
spectroscopic analysis.

16:58.642 --> 17:01.353
All gases in the planet's atmosphere
are tolerable.

17:01.437 --> 17:04.189
The soil and water samples
from the ground team

17:04.273 --> 17:08.027
have no significant traces
of any known toxins or carcinogens.

17:08.527 --> 17:11.488
Paula's right. This planet's
as good as it gets for the colonists.

17:11.572 --> 17:14.533
If things have gone badly on Earth,
we may be coming back ourselves.

17:14.616 --> 17:16.827
So I wanna make sure
that I'm not dooming us to our death.

17:16.910 --> 17:20.789
No one's as protective as you, Niko.
I've seen it myself first-hand.

17:20.873 --> 17:24.460
And what have you seen since you've come
online other than how I brew a latte?

17:25.044 --> 17:26.879
Dillon re-linked my memory files.

17:27.880 --> 17:31.550
Yes. But you didn't live those memories.
William did.

17:32.718 --> 17:35.721
-Make things ready for the away mission.
-Yes, Niko.

17:37.181 --> 17:38.766
Away mission? Does that mean--

17:38.849 --> 17:40.184
Wake up the colonists.

17:40.267 --> 17:43.687
You go down, get them established,
come straight back.

17:43.771 --> 17:46.648
I'll need to catch them up
on the geophysical prospecting.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.609
Identify favorable targets for drilling--

17:48.692 --> 17:51.653
-How long will that take?
-A day. Two, at the most.

17:52.321 --> 17:53.238
And then straight home.

17:54.156 --> 17:55.240
And then straight home.

17:59.578 --> 18:01.580
[birds calling]

18:11.882 --> 18:14.718
These tree analogs will provide
the raw material we need

18:14.802 --> 18:16.762
to build our permanent housing structures.

18:25.145 --> 18:26.438
Which Quonset you in?

18:27.147 --> 18:30.734
I'm with the Salvare.
Here to catch you guys up on the terrain.

18:30.818 --> 18:33.403
Oh. Really? You got the vibe.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.573
There's a Quonset vibe?

18:42.162 --> 18:45.207
Like I've said, you're suited to this.

18:46.083 --> 18:48.001
You're careful, level-headed,

18:48.585 --> 18:51.338
but you're also curious
and see the potential of things.

18:52.005 --> 18:55.008
Thanks. But I'm not leaving Niko.

18:55.717 --> 18:56.718
But you could.

18:57.678 --> 19:00.347
Just like she could wake up another pilot
from Soma.

19:01.014 --> 19:02.224
Gotta get back to Earth.

19:02.933 --> 19:03.767
Earth.

19:05.477 --> 19:06.979
No family,

19:07.980 --> 19:09.106
no Yerxa.

19:09.189 --> 19:10.107
Hey, fuck you.

19:14.069 --> 19:15.154
I'm sorry.

19:16.905 --> 19:18.448
That was… [sighs]

19:19.741 --> 19:23.453
Stay. Help us build things, dig things.

19:23.537 --> 19:27.916
Make a harvest, have babies,
watch them have babies,

19:28.417 --> 19:29.835
and those babies have more,

19:29.918 --> 19:32.796
while you, Great-Grandma Cas, can tell--

19:35.591 --> 19:36.842
What the fuck was that?

19:38.093 --> 19:39.219
[growling]

19:40.721 --> 19:43.265
You two, on me.
We'll follow it, see where it goes.

19:43.348 --> 19:45.934
-You three, hold position.
-I know the terrain.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.353
If something happens,
bring the others back to camp.

19:50.939 --> 19:52.107
[growling]

19:52.191 --> 19:53.317
[snorting]

19:56.820 --> 19:58.280
[thudding]

19:58.363 --> 20:00.282
Fuck! They're everywhere.

20:01.783 --> 20:03.243
[branch breaking]

20:04.161 --> 20:05.454
[growling]

20:09.374 --> 20:10.250
[sniffs]

20:10.334 --> 20:11.543
[snorts]

20:13.712 --> 20:16.173
[makes plosive, speech-like sounds]

20:22.346 --> 20:24.932
[Paula] Cas, don't get any closer to it.

20:26.850 --> 20:28.268
Step back!

20:30.103 --> 20:31.063
Hold.

20:32.648 --> 20:34.233
[screeches]

20:46.745 --> 20:49.957
It had paint on it. It looked like
war paint or some type of status mark.

20:50.540 --> 20:51.959
It had a weapon that it made.

20:52.042 --> 20:55.837
They can communicate.
It sounded like clicking consonants.

20:55.921 --> 20:58.715
They knew how to strategize,
and they knew how to separate us.

20:58.799 --> 21:00.759
-That's speculation.
-No, it's not.

21:02.552 --> 21:04.888
The way it looked at me,
these aren't wild animals.

21:04.972 --> 21:06.515
They're intelligent life-forms.

21:06.598 --> 21:09.935
They are primitive cave-people.

21:10.018 --> 21:12.646
[sighs] And to the Achaia,
we're cave-people.

21:12.729 --> 21:15.190
-That is not a fair comparison.
-How would you like it

21:15.274 --> 21:17.609
-if the Achaia colonized Earth?
-Who says they haven't?

21:18.193 --> 21:21.488
But unlike the Achaia,
we are not a threat to these things.

21:21.571 --> 21:23.365
What happens the next time they attack?

21:23.448 --> 21:25.325
You kill another, then another?

21:25.409 --> 21:27.452
Luckily, we won't be around
to experience that,

21:27.536 --> 21:30.247
-because USIC protocol clearly dictates…
-Fuck USIC protocol.

21:30.330 --> 21:34.668
…that we cannot colonize a planet
with a preexisting civilization.

21:34.751 --> 21:35.711
You know this.

21:35.794 --> 21:38.588
Have your team pack up their things
and load it onto the shuttle.

21:39.256 --> 21:40.882
Cas will help with anything that you need.

21:47.931 --> 21:49.433
That planet is perfect.

21:49.516 --> 21:51.184
We found Eden.

21:51.977 --> 21:55.188
-And now we gotta leave because--
-It's not our planet. It's theirs.

21:55.272 --> 21:56.815
You fucked up everything.

21:56.898 --> 21:58.150
I followed protocol.

21:58.233 --> 21:59.067
Right.

21:59.985 --> 22:01.528
And I've got it from here.

22:04.906 --> 22:06.450
[door opens]

22:07.534 --> 22:09.202
[door closes]

22:10.912 --> 22:12.164
We'll have to ration.

22:12.247 --> 22:15.542
Twenty-four extra mouths to feed
is a lot, but I can make it work.

22:16.209 --> 22:17.878
I'll organize sleeping arrangements.

22:17.961 --> 22:20.047
They'll have to sleep in shifts,
avoid doubling up.

22:21.757 --> 22:22.591
William,

22:23.633 --> 22:27.220
the one good thing Gabriel did do
was find us a faster route home.

22:27.304 --> 22:29.056
Shaved a month off our travel time.

22:29.556 --> 22:32.351
-See if you can improve on that?
-I'll try and work some magic.

22:33.477 --> 22:34.436
I know you will.

22:37.022 --> 22:38.148
[William disappears]

22:39.149 --> 22:41.985
[Richard] You feel like letting Erik know
you're on your way home?

22:44.321 --> 22:48.492
You know all those tiny cracks in
ice cubes? Cosmic strings are like that.

22:48.575 --> 22:52.537
Ultra-thin, energy-dense cracks left over
from when the universe was forming.

22:52.621 --> 22:56.291
Until today, they were theoretical.
We've never been able to detect them.

22:56.375 --> 22:59.294
No human has. Thankfully, we've got Iara.

23:00.545 --> 23:03.173
And you found one?
-Yes. Within this star system.

23:03.715 --> 23:07.219
It's low tension, but we might be able
to use it the way the Achaia use them

23:07.302 --> 23:09.054
and get the superluminal comms
up and running.

23:09.638 --> 23:11.765
[Dillon] Plotting trajectory
around the cosmic strings.

23:11.848 --> 23:13.350
We're gonna have to draw power from it

23:13.433 --> 23:17.020
while also utilizing its curvature
of space-time to thread the wormhole.

23:17.521 --> 23:21.108
I have not done this before,
and it is gonna be tricky.

23:21.691 --> 23:24.820
-Negative matter production is stable.
-[pulsating hum]

23:24.903 --> 23:26.905
I've isolated a cosmic string.

23:26.988 --> 23:29.324
-Inputting coordinates…
-[humming intensifying]

23:29.991 --> 23:30.826
…now.

23:31.410 --> 23:35.622
Wormhole formation in three, two, one…

23:37.165 --> 23:38.542
Wormhole is stabilizing.

23:38.625 --> 23:40.127
[power intensifying]

23:44.047 --> 23:45.757
[power fading]

23:48.135 --> 23:51.930
[Dillon] Wormhole was stable
for .13 seconds before it collapsed.

23:52.013 --> 23:52.848
It worked?

23:53.348 --> 23:56.101
Long enough to receive
a massive data dump from Earth.

23:56.184 --> 23:57.936
[Richard] Can we send messages back?

23:58.019 --> 24:00.355
[Dillon] Eventually.
But look what we've got here.

24:00.439 --> 24:04.568
Mission updates from USIC, going back
to where we lost comms around Sirius A.

24:06.486 --> 24:08.196
And personal messages from home.

24:11.032 --> 24:13.076
Hey. You get anything?

24:13.160 --> 24:14.911
-Yeah, a message from my parents.
-Good news?

24:14.995 --> 24:17.330
Richard, I have zero interest
in small talk.

24:17.414 --> 24:19.166
Or any talk that isn't job-related.

24:19.249 --> 24:22.586
But, if you're desperate for a chat,
I can pull Javier out of cryo.

24:22.669 --> 24:25.547
You know what outside stimulation
does to coma patients.

24:31.720 --> 24:33.722
[whooshing]

24:36.933 --> 24:38.268
Hey. Colony's off.

24:38.351 --> 24:42.189
-[sighs] Uh… Not sure if you heard.
-Yeah. I did. Thanks.

24:44.149 --> 24:46.776
Um… Anyways,
people are gonna have to shack up,

24:46.860 --> 24:52.365
and, um… I was thinking that maybe
you and I can co-shack together.

24:52.908 --> 24:55.410
-Bernie, is that really a good idea?
-[sighs]

24:56.661 --> 24:58.205
How long are you gonna punish me?

24:58.705 --> 25:01.166
-I'm not punishing you.
-No? You said some awful things.

25:01.249 --> 25:03.210
-Because you did some awful things.
-[sighs]

25:03.293 --> 25:04.794
Uh, I'm fucking done.

25:04.878 --> 25:06.379
Wait. Uh-- You're right.

25:07.756 --> 25:10.342
The last thing I said was awful,

25:11.218 --> 25:12.093
but…

25:13.094 --> 25:14.054
I was angry.

25:14.638 --> 25:18.600
-I get it. Look, I disappointed you.
-Yeah, then you disappeared.

25:18.683 --> 25:22.354
-I didn't think I'd see you again.
-Well, I'm here. I'm back.

25:23.146 --> 25:27.484
I know. But sharing quarters? Really?
We just got back together.

25:27.567 --> 25:30.737
Why saddle our relationship
with my crazy OCD and your snoring?

25:30.820 --> 25:33.698
Oh, man, you forgot that I'm terrible
at folding clothes,

25:33.782 --> 25:35.659
or even just putting them away.

25:35.742 --> 25:36.618
Yeah, you are.

25:39.704 --> 25:42.958
[sighs] Maybe we could just… talk.

25:58.974 --> 26:01.351
Hey. Turns out I'm an uncle.

26:01.977 --> 26:05.188
My sister didn't even know
she was knocked up when we left Earth.

26:05.272 --> 26:07.232
-[laughs]
-Congratulations.

26:07.315 --> 26:08.400
She's cute, huh?

26:10.277 --> 26:12.070
-[bleep]
-Hey, you-- you okay?

26:12.862 --> 26:13.822
Mmm.

26:22.289 --> 26:24.291
[bleeping and whirring]

26:29.629 --> 26:32.090
-You ready to go?
-Yeah. Almost.

26:33.133 --> 26:35.010
Can you do the shuttle preflight?

26:35.594 --> 26:37.095
[whirring]

26:38.388 --> 26:41.975
-Thought you didn't want my help.
-It's really the least you could do.

26:44.436 --> 26:46.521
You were right, Paula.

26:47.272 --> 26:49.524
Everybody I care about is here,
not on Earth.

26:49.608 --> 26:52.485
Let me guess, the rest of the crew
got letters from home except for you?

26:54.863 --> 26:56.489
Maybe I am built for colony life.

26:56.573 --> 26:59.284
-Yeah. Well, we'll never find out.
-[alarm sounding]

27:01.286 --> 27:02.871
-What are you doing?
-[bleeping]

27:04.706 --> 27:06.249
Why are you launching the colony pods?

27:06.333 --> 27:07.584
-On whose authority?
-[gun cocks]

27:13.590 --> 27:14.924
[instruments whirring]

27:18.553 --> 27:21.181
Let's try a spectrographic analysis.

27:21.264 --> 27:25.060
That won't work, 'cause it's made out of
whatever the Artifact is, right?

27:25.644 --> 27:27.437
You know, maybe Congress will surprise us

27:27.520 --> 27:29.481
and tell the Achaians
to go fuck 'emselves.

27:29.564 --> 27:32.734
Mmph. Maybe whatever this is
will blow up the planet.

27:32.817 --> 27:34.694
Wow. That got dark fast.

27:34.778 --> 27:35.987
[panting]

27:36.071 --> 27:39.366
You're not answering your phones.
You know how far it is to USIC HQ?

27:39.449 --> 27:40.575
Did something happen?

27:40.659 --> 27:44.537
USIC received confirmation
of a data transmission to the Salvare.

27:49.626 --> 27:53.338
The Salvare re-established their comms.

27:53.421 --> 27:56.966
It was only for a second and one-way,
but they're alive.

27:57.050 --> 27:58.927
-They're alive. Okay.
-Your wife's alive.

28:02.055 --> 28:05.433
Grandma B says Auggie scratches
'cause I hug him too tight.

28:05.517 --> 28:07.769
But then I pet him,
and he still scratches me.

28:07.852 --> 28:10.063
-[laughing]
-He is evil.

28:10.146 --> 28:11.815
-He is.
-[sighs]

28:14.401 --> 28:17.654
And you know how you gave me your ring
on the Artifact?

28:17.737 --> 28:20.740
I was gonna put it on my necklace,
but Dad took it from me.

28:20.824 --> 28:23.118
So I made him swear to keep it safe
while you're away.

28:23.201 --> 28:24.244
Keep it safe.

28:26.037 --> 28:29.124
And you keep it safe until we see
each other again. Do you promise?

28:29.833 --> 28:30.792
I promise.

28:34.879 --> 28:35.964
She had my ring.

28:36.464 --> 28:38.508
-What ring?
-My wedding ring.

28:39.300 --> 28:40.760
When I was in the Achaian ship,

28:40.844 --> 28:43.513
Jana was in the Artifact,
and we saw each other.

28:43.596 --> 28:46.224
I didn't believe it was possible,
and I wanted to test it.

28:46.307 --> 28:49.519
So I took off my wedding ring,
and I gave it to her.

28:49.602 --> 28:51.604
She has it with her across the galaxy.

28:51.688 --> 28:55.108
So the Achaians don't just transmit data
via wormhole, they send matter?

28:56.109 --> 28:57.360
Pull up the star map.

29:00.029 --> 29:02.782
This is the Achaian ship
that disintegrated around that magnetar.

29:02.866 --> 29:06.786
Before that, it was here.
Pi Canis Majoris. Zakir.

29:06.870 --> 29:09.831
-Where was it before that?
-Right there. Immediately before.

29:09.914 --> 29:10.957
Twenty light years away.

29:11.040 --> 29:12.625
We have been struggling

29:12.709 --> 29:15.378
to stabilize microscopic wormholes
for our superluminal comms,

29:15.462 --> 29:18.089
and the Achaians use them
to transit entire ships.

29:18.882 --> 29:19.883
Can we do that?

29:19.966 --> 29:21.092
With the Salvare?

29:21.593 --> 29:25.930
[scoffs] I mean, that's impossible, right?
The amount of energy required alone is--

29:26.014 --> 29:27.432
High-tension loops.

29:27.515 --> 29:30.018
There are two types of cosmic strings,

29:30.101 --> 29:33.062
low-tension, the one that we used,
and high-tension loops,

29:33.146 --> 29:35.648
which is a cosmic string
that's folded over itself.

29:35.732 --> 29:38.318
The Achaia are able
to somehow tap into their energy.

29:38.985 --> 29:41.613
-Where is the nearest high-tension loop?
-[rapid bleeping]

29:41.696 --> 29:44.616
Between us and the next closest star
to this system.

29:44.699 --> 29:47.410
So knowing what you know about
Achaian tech and the limits of our ship,

29:47.494 --> 29:50.830
can we use that loop to make the wormhole
large enough to fit the Salvare?

29:50.914 --> 29:52.081
Theoretically, yes.

29:52.165 --> 29:55.126
But loops dissipate at a much quicker rate
than cosmic strings.

29:55.210 --> 29:58.171
So, we would have to get going now.

29:58.630 --> 30:00.590
William, how far out is Cas?

30:00.673 --> 30:02.217
She's in the shuttle bay.

30:02.300 --> 30:04.677
-She's back already?
-She never left.

30:05.595 --> 30:06.638
What?

30:10.517 --> 30:12.602
You mutiny 'cause
you don't agree with protocol?

30:12.685 --> 30:14.479
We came through USIC together.

30:14.562 --> 30:17.440
You know I'm not a psychopath
who'd eradicate an entire species.

30:17.524 --> 30:18.817
I don't know what you'd do.

30:23.863 --> 30:25.114
It's okay, Paula.

30:25.198 --> 30:28.201
We found a way.
It's a shortcut back to Earth.

30:28.284 --> 30:32.956
An overpopulated, overheated planet
in the middle of an alien invasion?

30:33.039 --> 30:35.416
[scoffs] I'll take my chances down there.

30:35.500 --> 30:36.501
[bleeping]

30:37.126 --> 30:38.628
[Paula yells]

30:41.339 --> 30:42.799
Cancel the launch sequence, Cas.

30:46.970 --> 30:50.056
-I can't, Niko. She locked me out.
-[both yelling]

30:51.432 --> 30:54.352
-Come on, Paula.
-[Salvare] Launch sequence terminated.

30:56.271 --> 30:57.856
That's enough, Paula.

30:59.607 --> 31:01.276
Confine her to her quarters.

31:05.321 --> 31:07.490
You have enough quarters
to confine all of us?

31:07.574 --> 31:12.120
Twenty-four colonists
versus six Salvare crew and two holograms.

31:12.203 --> 31:14.247
If they even agree to come back up here.

31:14.330 --> 31:17.292
-You don't have the supplies.
-We have an entire fucking planet.

31:17.375 --> 31:19.127
I am not leaving without you.

31:19.210 --> 31:21.212
And we are not going alive.

31:21.296 --> 31:23.506
-Just let her go, Niko.
-I can't.

31:23.590 --> 31:26.551
How many more of our friends have to die
for this mission?

31:26.634 --> 31:28.344
I am doing this to save lives.

31:28.428 --> 31:32.223
I know. If letting Paula go means no one
has to die today, then just let her go.

31:33.349 --> 31:34.976
Think about the crew we still have.

31:35.977 --> 31:39.063
[William] Niko, our window of opportunity
is closing fast.

31:40.607 --> 31:42.150
Don't make me regret this.

31:45.737 --> 31:46.696
-[click]
-[alarm sounds]

31:46.779 --> 31:50.158

of the high-tension loop.

33:04.607 --> 33:05.441
Okay.

33:07.819 --> 33:09.320
[burbling and bleeping]

33:14.200 --> 33:16.828
Starting over is not easy for me.

33:17.453 --> 33:19.038
It means letting go of William.

33:20.790 --> 33:21.874
I understand.

33:23.292 --> 33:24.669
He was special to you.

33:27.422 --> 33:29.382
He was a member of this crew.

33:31.342 --> 33:32.260
So are you.

33:35.346 --> 33:37.223
Cas, status report?

33:37.306 --> 33:39.308
[pulsating whirring]

33:40.184 --> 33:41.019
We're ready.

33:41.769 --> 33:43.563
[Niko] All right, everyone. Showtime.

33:44.063 --> 33:47.358
What we are about to do
is not without risk,

33:48.067 --> 33:50.820
but the reward is
an express ticket back to Earth.

33:51.404 --> 33:52.697
We all know the plan.

33:54.032 --> 33:55.283
We know our jobs.

33:57.410 --> 33:58.411
Let's go home.

34:00.163 --> 34:02.832
-Dillon?
-Negative matter production is stable.

34:04.667 --> 34:05.710
Iara?

34:05.793 --> 34:08.963
Connection established between the Salvare
and the high-tension loop.

34:09.047 --> 34:12.383
Wormhole should be opening… now.

34:12.467 --> 34:14.469
[rushing]

34:17.555 --> 34:18.556
It's working.

34:22.226 --> 34:23.352
Oh, my God!

34:27.607 --> 34:29.358
-I see Jupiter.
-[laughs]

34:30.651 --> 34:31.736
[Iara] There's a problem.

34:31.819 --> 34:34.572
The loop has dissipated
more than anticipated.

34:34.655 --> 34:35.865
What does that mean?

34:35.948 --> 34:39.077
The Salvare has too much mass
to transit the wormhole.

34:39.160 --> 34:40.369
There's got to be a way.

34:40.453 --> 34:42.080
Yeah. Ditch a shit ton of mass.

34:42.163 --> 34:45.333
So we split the ship in two.
Send the Salvare one half at a time.

34:45.416 --> 34:48.252
The wormhole will collapse
as soon as sufficient mass transits.

34:48.336 --> 34:50.755
[Iara] We'd only get half of it through.

34:58.638 --> 35:00.431
Everyone head to deck three.
That is an order.

35:01.933 --> 35:03.559
You're doing this manually?

35:04.811 --> 35:07.313
It's the only way to override
the Go Home Protocol's redundancies.

35:07.855 --> 35:10.399
Niko, don't. You'll be stranded.

35:10.483 --> 35:12.026
Computer, turn off comms.

35:16.531 --> 35:18.783
William, Cas is gonna need you.

35:18.866 --> 35:19.700
Go.

35:20.284 --> 35:21.119
Yes, Niko.

35:21.994 --> 35:22.912
Let me.

35:22.995 --> 35:26.040
You can't.
You are not the commander of this ship.

35:27.208 --> 35:28.501
Is everyone on deck three?

35:28.584 --> 35:31.254
[Salvare] Everyone except
Commander Niko Breckinridge

35:31.337 --> 35:32.463
and Richard Ncube.

35:32.547 --> 35:33.673
Lock down that deck.

35:35.383 --> 35:37.135
So Cas doesn't do anything foolish.

35:38.219 --> 35:41.055
It's been a pleasure serving with you,
Commander.

35:42.306 --> 35:43.141
