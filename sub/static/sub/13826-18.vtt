prettier janitor, huh?

Oh, look, here they are! In this bush!

(GERMAN ACCENT) No, I hate that bush. I
never go near it.

call it even.

anybody in the building.

upset that his hot tub won't work,

10:48.065 --> 10:49.816
that he won't try to take over

My friend and I were traveling along when
we spotted you,

12:07.144 --> 12:10.355
and it seemed like, well, maybe you could
use some help.

12:10.731 --> 12:15.777
Well, you know, it just so
happens I really, really like to help.

12:15.861 --> 12:18.780
So when we saw you here,
I just couldn't resist

12:19.114 --> 12:20.824
Please, don't you worry about a thing.

12:21.116 --> 12:25.120
Cause there is nothing more in the world
I would rather do, then help.

12:33.670 --> 12:34.713
How'd that go?

12:35.214 --> 12:37.716
Oh, okay, I guess.

12:37.799 --> 12:38.926
Funny thing, though.

12:39.009 --> 12:41.178
-That guy...He...
-He didn't need your help?

12:41.386 --> 12:42.387
Yeah.

12:42.471 --> 12:43.472
How'd you guess?

12:43.555 --> 12:44.681
Strange as it may seem

12:44.765 --> 12:46.183
Wander, there's a time to help.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.393
-And there's a time to...
-WANDER: Hello!

12:48.477 --> 12:51.605
Hey there. Hi friend, which way
you headed?

12:53.357 --> 12:57.361
-Wha-
-I said which way you headed?

12:57.528 --> 13:00.322
You going up ways? Down ways? Sideways?
North ways? North by Northwest ways?

13:00.405 --> 13:01.406
Why you ask?

13:04.618 --> 13:07.663
Oh, this? I was just giving you a
thumbs up.

13:07.871 --> 13:09.081
I really like your hat.

13:10.958 --> 13:12.042
Like those shoes, too.

13:16.463 --> 13:21.176
-So then you're not in need of a ride?
-A ride?

13:21.510 --> 13:24.930
Of course I am. I've been waiting here
for hours and here comes my ride now.

13:25.305 --> 13:26.348
Right on time.

13:34.273 --> 13:35.607
SYLVIA: It's like I told you, Wander.

13:35.691 --> 13:38.569
There's a time to help
and a time to not help.

13:39.778 --> 13:41.446
WANDER (WHISPERING): Sylvia! Did you
hear that?

13:41.530 --> 13:42.948
Yeah, I did.

13:43.198 --> 13:44.491
It sounded like...

13:54.960 --> 13:58.463
Don't worry, Little birdie!
I'll help you...

14:07.639 --> 14:08.932
Birdie! Wait. Birdie!

14:09.057 --> 14:12.269
Do you need help finding the way south?
How about which worms taste good?

14:12.352 --> 14:15.063
Name of a good dentist? Any...thing?

14:17.774 --> 14:18.775
Look at it this way.

14:18.859 --> 14:21.570
It's a good thing not everybody
needs your help all the time.

14:22.112 --> 14:23.780
-Why?
-Well,

14:23.864 --> 14:25.908
you wouldn't want to sprain your
help gland.

14:26.408 --> 14:27.451
-My wha...
-I don't know.

14:27.534 --> 14:28.619
I just made it up.

14:30.495 --> 14:34.082
-I'm sorry Wander I was just trying to...
-No, Sylvia, you're right.

14:34.166 --> 14:35.959
Nobody needs any help today.

14:36.376 --> 14:39.087
So let's just relax
and enjoy the rest of the day.

14:39.213 --> 14:40.339
Exactly.

14:40.797 --> 14:43.759
Hey, look, there's a relaxing
little town down there.

14:44.218 --> 14:47.721
A town? I bet there's lots of people there
who need help.

14:49.598 --> 14:51.099
WANDER (IN THE DISTANCE): Woohoo!

14:52.142 --> 14:53.435
Sighs.

14:54.895 --> 14:57.856

14:57.940 --> 15:00.567

15:21.964 --> 15:24.716
Hey, Wander. You know, this town
is actually pretty cool.

15:24.800 --> 15:27.344
There's a killer lemonade
stand on the next corner.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.263
Oh, I see you found the fudge shop.

15:30.722 --> 15:32.140
It's not fudge.

15:32.266 --> 15:33.934
Look at this pair of shades.

15:34.017 --> 15:38.021
I picked up the second hand shop
down the street, aren't they everything?

15:38.272 --> 15:39.439
SYLVIA: I got some for you too.

15:39.523 --> 15:42.109
-Oh, there was also...
-It's not fudge.

15:42.192 --> 15:43.235
It's mud.

15:43.402 --> 15:45.404
Oh, you found the mud pie shop.

15:45.487 --> 15:47.447
I love mud pies.

15:47.531 --> 15:49.032
-We should
-Not mud pies.

15:49.116 --> 15:50.659
Just mud

15:50.742 --> 15:51.994
WOMAN: Help!

15:52.119 --> 15:53.120
Hold that thought!

15:57.499 --> 16:00.294
Help! Oh somebody, help me!

16:01.378 --> 16:02.754
I'll help you!

16:09.553 --> 16:10.554
Howdy Ma'am!

16:10.637 --> 16:11.638
MAN: Hold it!

16:12.181 --> 16:14.349
Would someone mind explaining to me

16:14.516 --> 16:16.727
just what is going on around here?

16:16.810 --> 16:20.063
MOVIE CREW: I don't see it in the
scripts sir.

16:20.230 --> 16:23.025
(CHATTERING)

16:23.400 --> 16:24.401
You mean?

16:25.319 --> 16:26.695
CREW (TOGETHER): That's right.

16:27.029 --> 16:30.157
We're making a movie.

16:40.042 --> 16:41.251
Oh, help?

16:44.338 --> 16:45.631
DIRECTOR: Hold it!

16:45.714 --> 16:47.341
What's that guy doing on set?

16:52.721 --> 16:53.722
You mean?

16:54.223 --> 16:59.353
That's right, we're making a movie.

16:59.895 --> 17:03.607
About making a movie.

17:12.491 --> 17:13.825
SYLVIA: There you are wander.

17:14.243 --> 17:18.330
Man, there is a really great street market
just down the...street.

17:18.455 --> 17:20.332
I picked up this festive scarf.

17:20.415 --> 17:22.084
Oh, and check this out.

17:30.050 --> 17:32.427
Whoa. How about we grab a bite and relax?

17:32.970 --> 17:35.180
WANDER (SIGHING): Gosh, you were
right Syl.

17:35.264 --> 17:38.225
There's nothing that a triple
pickle cream pie can't solve.

17:40.394 --> 17:42.354
I guess I did get a little
carried away back there.

17:42.437 --> 17:45.649
-You think?
-Some days folks don't need a helpin'.

17:45.732 --> 17:46.733
Exactly.

17:46.817 --> 17:48.610
I mean, it's not like Hater is going
to show up

17:48.694 --> 17:52.656
with his army of watchdogs and try
to take over the town or something.

18:02.624 --> 18:05.502
Hater. Watchdogs. Taking over the town.

18:05.794 --> 18:07.963
-You know what this means?
-Check please?

18:08.255 --> 18:09.506
No.

18:16.889 --> 18:19.349
It means it's time to help.

18:22.311 --> 18:24.479
Fear not folks, I got this.

18:27.191 --> 18:28.775
(SINGING) Saving the day!

18:35.782 --> 18:36.909
How can I help you?

18:37.618 --> 18:39.620
I'm so glad you asked

18:39.703 --> 18:41.955
Mi...chelle,

18:42.497 --> 18:47.461
because we would like two...three...
four... Bah! Forget it.

18:47.586 --> 18:51.089
Just let me have 5075 frivolity meals,

18:51.256 --> 18:55.844
-689 pies and two Diet coke...
-Hold It!

18:57.095 --> 18:59.681
Okay, I know what you're here for,
Lord Hater.

18:59.765 --> 19:02.851
But unfortunately for you, I'm here to
help these people.

19:02.976 --> 19:05.979
So you're just going to have
to get right back on your ship

19:06.063 --> 19:07.439
What's going on over here Michelle?

19:07.773 --> 19:08.941
I'm not sure, sir.

19:09.024 --> 19:10.984
He just hopped up there and a...

19:11.401 --> 19:15.739
I'm sorry, son, but I'm going to have to
ask you to come down from there right now.

19:15.822 --> 19:18.033
We're simply not insured for
that kind of...

19:18.116 --> 19:20.869
But he's going to take over your town
and I'm here to help.

19:20.994 --> 19:24.206
Take over? He's here to take
out his lunch.

19:24.289 --> 19:25.332
Sorry, Michelle.

19:25.415 --> 19:28.210
Now please come down from there
before someone gets hurt.

19:29.503 --> 19:30.546
His lunch?

19:30.963 --> 19:32.130
That's not possible.

19:32.256 --> 19:34.967
Of course it's possible. These guys have
the best

19:35.050 --> 19:36.844
triple pickle pies in the universe.

19:36.927 --> 19:39.972
Thank you.
We take great pride in our pies.

19:42.599 --> 19:44.142
Thank you. Come again.

19:44.893 --> 19:45.894
Now, son...

19:47.062 --> 19:49.314
WANDER (SCREAMING): I gotta help!

19:49.439 --> 19:51.191
You? You need your neck tie straightened?

19:53.277 --> 19:55.737
How about you, shoelaces tied?

19:57.072 --> 19:58.532
Your glasses polished?

20:04.162 --> 20:05.706
Can I help you carry your ice-cream cone?

20:09.418 --> 20:11.295
I only wanted to help.

20:21.430 --> 20:22.890
Wake up, son.

20:22.973 --> 20:24.683
Can you hear me?

20:25.142 --> 20:26.226
Son, can you hear me?

20:27.436 --> 20:29.897
Sorry about the pies.

20:30.230 --> 20:32.191
It's okay. We cleaned them up.

20:32.941 --> 20:34.693
Did you need any...help?

20:34.776 --> 20:37.738
No, son. We took care of
it. But...

20:38.780 --> 20:42.242
there is one thing we could really use
your help with.

20:43.118 --> 20:45.704
Really? What is it? Anything! Anything!

20:45.787 --> 20:50.125
Well, there's... somebody we need you to
run out of town.

20:50.626 --> 20:52.211
Of course. Where is he?

20:52.294 --> 20:53.962
WANDER: Show him to me.

20:58.008 --> 21:02.429
Oh, so this is the guy you want
out of town.

21:03.639 --> 21:04.640
I get it.

21:04.765 --> 21:05.766
You do?

21:07.601 --> 21:09.228
Look, son. We only mean...

21:09.311 --> 21:13.774
And I will not rest until that guy is
out of here once and for all!

21:21.865 --> 21:24.826
So, you're the one they want run out
of town.

21:25.744 --> 21:27.162
So they say.

21:28.121 --> 21:32.793
Well, lucky for them, I'm here to help.

21:35.087 --> 21:36.255
Hey!

21:41.134 --> 21:42.302
Oh you caught me!

21:46.557 --> 21:48.350
I'm going, I'm going.

21:52.229 --> 21:54.147
And...stay out.

21:56.525 --> 21:58.610
Yay!

22:02.573 --> 22:03.615
Son,

22:04.658 --> 22:05.701
Thanks.

22:06.618 --> 22:08.203
Happy I could help.

22:08.495 --> 22:10.080
That makes two of us.

22:17.754 --> 22:19.047
Pass the mustard.

22:19.381 --> 22:21.133
Did they change these fries?

22:21.341 --> 22:22.509
Oh, so good.

22:23.886 --> 22:25.637
I am making such a mess.

22:25.721 --> 22:27.848
Hey, Peepers. Pass me some of
those napkins.

22:28.807 --> 22:31.894
Oh, that's what I'm talking about,
so good.
