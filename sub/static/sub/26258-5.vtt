Ba-bum.

<i>Previously on</i>
"The Dragon Prince"...

00:20.512 --> 00:21.885
It's up to us now.

00:21.980 --> 00:23.853
We have to return this egg.

00:23.932 --> 00:27.159
We have to keep it safe
and carry it to Xadia.

00:27.227 --> 00:28.628
And find its mother.

00:30.605 --> 00:32.457
Aunt Amaya?

00:36.778 --> 00:38.509
I'm so glad you're safe.

00:38.947 --> 00:41.034
Though it is a heavy burden,

00:41.121 --> 00:45.408
I will humbly take up the battle
in Harrow's name.

00:45.495 --> 00:47.310
Stop the coronation!

00:47.377 --> 00:49.724
The princes are alive!

00:50.917 --> 00:52.207
What now?

00:52.294 --> 00:54.401
Ugh. I don't think a boat...

00:54.469 --> 00:55.509
Just get in.

02:00.654 --> 02:04.048
Good morning, little rays of sunshine.

02:08.912 --> 02:12.432
A volunteer. How eager.

02:41.277 --> 02:42.278
Hmm.

03:07.262 --> 03:09.447
This doesn't end well for you.

03:10.181 --> 03:13.019
Last night, you thought
the cube was just a worthless toy.

03:13.106 --> 03:14.270
But now we know...

03:14.357 --> 03:15.892
It's a glow toy.

03:18.690 --> 03:19.774
Exactly.

03:20.358 --> 03:21.401
Exactly.

03:21.985 --> 03:23.905
I'm going to find some food.

03:23.992 --> 03:25.610
Wait, we've got food.

03:25.697 --> 03:28.841
We grabbed a sack of bread
at the Banther Lodge.

03:28.950 --> 03:31.427
I thought this was a sack of clubs.

03:39.044 --> 03:42.146
No, it's food... ish.

03:44.299 --> 03:45.842
I'm good.

04:07.572 --> 04:10.167
Thought I might run into you here.

04:11.826 --> 04:13.511
We need to talk.

04:41.147 --> 04:43.207
Here goes nothing.

04:46.694 --> 04:48.238
Easy now.

04:55.745 --> 04:58.598
Ugh. What is this thing made of?

05:04.003 --> 05:06.522
Help! Help!

05:18.685 --> 05:20.870
What is it? What happened?

05:21.771 --> 05:22.772
Help!

05:27.235 --> 05:29.859
He tried to copy
Claudia's lightning spell,

05:29.946 --> 05:31.574
but he doesn't know how to finish it.

05:31.661 --> 05:33.785
Yeah, I... I only saw her
do the first half.

05:33.872 --> 05:35.912
But I'm very good at the first half.

05:35.999 --> 05:39.577
Seriously? That sounds
like a really good and safe idea.

05:39.664 --> 05:42.830
Okay, lecture well-deserved,
but what do I do now?

05:42.917 --> 05:44.921
When you release a spell,
there's usually a word

05:45.008 --> 05:47.715
or a phrase or something
in ancient draconic.

05:47.802 --> 05:51.798
Okay. Uh, anybody speak dragon?
I don't speak dragon.

05:51.885 --> 05:54.175
- You didn't hear Claudia say anything?
- No.

05:54.262 --> 05:56.661
I mean, I think
right when I grabbed her hand away,

05:56.728 --> 05:58.393
she might have called me a fool.

05:58.480 --> 06:01.452
Yeah, fool seems about right.

06:01.561 --> 06:03.356
Okay, give me a second.

06:03.443 --> 06:06.916
I know some draconic words.
Just let me think.

06:09.611 --> 06:11.322
Know what? I'm just gonna throw it.

06:11.409 --> 06:12.777
What? No!

06:12.864 --> 06:14.868
Yeah, I'm gonna
throw you the Primal Stone.

06:14.955 --> 06:16.989
That's a good plan.

06:17.076 --> 06:19.826
No, that's not a good plan.
Throwing is bad.

06:19.913 --> 06:22.500
I won't throw it.
I'll just gently toss it.

06:22.587 --> 06:25.768
No, no, no! No throwing. No tossing.

06:26.711 --> 06:28.479
Tossing it.

06:30.882 --> 06:34.652
Ha! Ah! It worked. I'm okay.

06:37.388 --> 06:40.351
You're kind of making a sizzling sound.

06:41.684 --> 06:43.224
Sorry about that.

06:43.311 --> 06:45.523
I guess I'm just so excited
to be learning magic,

06:45.610 --> 06:48.145
and I got a little carried away.

06:48.232 --> 06:50.523
Okay, enough almost-killing me.

06:50.610 --> 06:54.407
The sooner we return this egg,
the sooner, maybe, this war can end.

06:54.494 --> 06:56.257
It's time to hit the road.

06:56.658 --> 07:00.366
Road? Why wear ourselves out
walking on a road

07:00.453 --> 07:03.139
when we can let the river do the walking?

07:03.539 --> 07:07.582
Nope. Say goodbye to the boat.
We go by land from here.

07:07.669 --> 07:10.251
But why?
The river's going the right direction,

07:10.338 --> 07:12.926
and moves much faster
than we ever could on foot.

07:13.013 --> 07:14.775
I mean, look at those legs.

07:15.051 --> 07:17.778
What? I have nice legs.

07:18.054 --> 07:20.489
We're walking. That's final.

07:24.269 --> 07:27.315
Is there maybe another reason
you don't wanna take the boat?

07:27.402 --> 07:29.248
Something you're not telling us?

07:29.357 --> 07:31.584
No. There's no secret reason.

07:31.693 --> 07:33.753
So, wait.

07:33.861 --> 07:36.366
Are you, like, this back-flippin',

07:36.453 --> 07:40.281
tree-climbin',
sword-stabbin' elven warrior,

07:40.368 --> 07:43.429
but scared of a little splish-splashin'?

07:45.001 --> 07:47.516
Aw, that's cute.

07:47.709 --> 07:50.186
Fine, we'll take the stupid boat.

07:53.256 --> 07:55.363
How could you let it come to this?

07:55.430 --> 07:58.778
You speak as if I invited these assassins.

07:59.095 --> 08:02.156
I had to leave our stronghold
at the Breach.

08:03.599 --> 08:07.433
Do you have any idea the dangerous forces
gathered at our border?

08:07.520 --> 08:10.400
I did everything in my power
to protect King Harrow.

08:10.487 --> 08:12.485
I was willing to give my own life.

08:12.572 --> 08:14.815
- Then what went wrong?
- He did.

08:14.902 --> 08:18.116
His own stubborn ways
stopped me from helping him.

08:18.203 --> 08:20.076
You know him as well as I do.

08:20.163 --> 08:23.594
His pride was more important to him
than his life!

08:23.703 --> 08:25.623
You wanted this outcome.

08:25.710 --> 08:27.890
How dare you suggest...

08:27.999 --> 08:30.503
His death creates opportunity for you.

08:30.590 --> 08:32.917
His death breaks my heart.

08:33.004 --> 08:35.919
Then honor him. Find his children.

08:36.006 --> 08:39.429
They're gone, Amaya.
Captured by a Moonshadow elf.

08:39.515 --> 08:42.905
If they're not already dead,
they will be soon.

08:42.991 --> 08:45.658
This is a time of crisis.

08:46.351 --> 08:52.832
An empty throne is a beacon of weakness,
an invitation to destroy us.

08:54.942 --> 08:57.942
We must defend Katolis

08:58.029 --> 09:01.632
and all of the human kingdoms
against what's coming.

09:01.719 --> 09:04.969
I can help us from there.

09:06.037 --> 09:08.619
You think I am being an opportunist.

09:08.706 --> 09:11.878
But I couldn't be more selfless
in my motivation.

09:11.965 --> 09:16.313
I am a servant of Katolis. I am a servant!

09:17.131 --> 09:21.026
Those are awfully nice clothes
for a humble servant, Viren.

09:22.303 --> 09:24.446
You don't believe me.

09:24.722 --> 09:28.222
Then you take it. Go ahead, sit down.

09:28.309 --> 09:30.911
I'll support you as queen regent.

09:31.020 --> 09:32.523
I'll gather the High Council,

09:32.610 --> 09:36.709
and we'll send word to the other crowns
of the Pentarchy immediately.

09:37.610 --> 09:41.672
The throne stays empty
until we find the boys.

09:54.836 --> 09:58.689
Bait, you know
you're not supposed to do that.

09:58.798 --> 10:01.010
No playing in the water.

10:01.097 --> 10:04.528
Bait loves the water,
but he should be afraid of it.

10:04.637 --> 10:05.993
You wanna know why he's named Bait?

10:06.060 --> 10:07.928
Not really.

10:08.015 --> 10:11.145
Well, I'm gonna tell you anyway.
It's kind of a sick joke, I guess.

10:11.232 --> 10:15.789
Glow toads?
They're apparently... delicious.

10:16.774 --> 10:17.774
Gross.

10:17.859 --> 10:21.155
Deep-sea fishermen use them
to catch giant fish, stuff like that.

10:21.242 --> 10:24.173
That's why he's named "Bait."
Get it?

10:24.532 --> 10:26.364
That's my stepdad's sense of humor.

10:26.451 --> 10:28.266
But, yeah, that's why
we have to be extra careful

10:28.333 --> 10:29.684
about him not getting in the water.

10:29.751 --> 10:33.543
Guys, he doesn't know
how delicious he is, so shh.

10:35.877 --> 10:38.771
And that's how the noodle got its name.

11:39.273 --> 11:42.292
May I light a candle?

11:54.538 --> 11:56.181
You doing all right?

11:56.290 --> 11:58.211
I'm doing great.

11:58.298 --> 12:00.875
I just love boats so much.

12:00.962 --> 12:03.961
That's why I'm down here.

12:04.048 --> 12:06.108
To be close to the boat.

12:07.802 --> 12:10.571
Tell you what.
I'm gonna ask you five questions.

12:10.680 --> 12:11.635
Please don't.

12:11.722 --> 12:15.409
Come on! It'll be a fun distraction,
help take your mind off things.

12:15.496 --> 12:18.522
Five questions,
that's all you get.

12:18.609 --> 12:20.436
Okay, question one.

12:20.523 --> 12:23.569
We always heard all these crazy things
about Xadia.

12:23.656 --> 12:27.651
Like, it was this place
with just... magic everywhere.

12:27.738 --> 12:29.840
Is that really what it's like?

12:29.949 --> 12:32.573
Yes. Next question.

12:32.660 --> 12:37.286
It must be so weird
that everywhere you look there's magic.

12:37.373 --> 12:41.498
It's not weird. In Xadia,
magic is pretty much in everything.

12:41.585 --> 12:45.299
It's no different from saying,
"Everywhere you look, there's nature."

12:45.386 --> 12:49.595
It's just part of the vibrance
or spirit of things, you know?

12:49.682 --> 12:53.030
I can't wait to see that.
It sounds incredible.

12:53.117 --> 12:55.846
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

12:55.933 --> 12:58.660
See, it's working, right?
Don't you feel a little better?

12:58.769 --> 13:01.357
Maybe so. Ask your next question.

13:01.444 --> 13:04.104
Okay, question two.

13:04.191 --> 13:06.043
What are your parents like?

13:06.402 --> 13:08.754
- They're dead.
- Oh.

13:09.030 --> 13:11.048
Rayla, I didn't mean to...

13:12.491 --> 13:13.492
It's fine.

13:15.328 --> 13:18.369
So, this might not be the best time
to bring this up,

13:18.456 --> 13:20.955
but are you sure
you're not scared of the water?

13:21.042 --> 13:22.253
I'm done with questions.

13:22.340 --> 13:25.687
I know, it's just...
the water's about to... Look!

13:28.507 --> 13:29.713
Pull the boat over!

13:29.800 --> 13:30.928
I don't think there's time.

13:31.015 --> 13:32.132
Pull it over!

13:32.219 --> 13:33.723
I admit it, I hate the water.

13:33.810 --> 13:37.407
I'm afraid of it. It makes me sick.
All of the bad feelings.

13:38.059 --> 13:40.702
It's too late, hang on!

13:47.985 --> 13:50.109
Hold tight!

13:58.454 --> 14:00.973
Your sister made him better.

14:01.791 --> 14:04.832
Harrow told me
he was never as strong or brave

14:04.919 --> 14:06.922
as Queen Sarai believed him to be,

14:07.009 --> 14:10.504
but he tried every day
to be stronger and braver

14:10.591 --> 14:13.569
so he could live up
to what she saw in him.

14:15.221 --> 14:18.323
She was compassionate and patient.

14:19.058 --> 14:21.994
Unless, of course,
you took the last jelly tart.

14:23.854 --> 14:26.484
I only made that mistake once.

14:28.734 --> 14:31.962
A sweet tooth and an iron fist.

14:32.613 --> 14:36.967
General Amaya, I am sorry
for what happened in the throne room.

14:37.118 --> 14:39.386
You helped me see the truth.

14:40.037 --> 14:42.431
And why was that so hard?

14:42.915 --> 14:48.729
I was blinded by my abiding love
of our kingdom and humanity itself.

14:50.172 --> 14:53.088
Guard, fetch a stable boy, quickly.

14:53.175 --> 14:56.528
I've encountered a giant pile of bull...

14:57.471 --> 14:58.472
droppings.

15:00.266 --> 15:01.930
The princes come first.

15:02.017 --> 15:04.855
Finding them
is absolutely the top priority

15:04.942 --> 15:08.207
- of the kingdom of Katolis.
- Good.

15:08.294 --> 15:10.125
You see it my way.

15:11.110 --> 15:14.004
I'll be departing at sundown
with a rescue party.

15:14.321 --> 15:16.784
Of course. But allow me to ask...

15:16.871 --> 15:18.842
what happens to the Breach?

15:19.452 --> 15:22.534
You said yourself
how precarious the situation is.

15:22.621 --> 15:25.209
Without you there commanding the fortress,

15:25.296 --> 15:28.894
do you believe, in your heart,
that the border will hold?

15:29.462 --> 15:31.355
Make your point.

15:31.464 --> 15:34.927
If the Breach falls,
the enemy will surge into Katolis,

15:35.014 --> 15:40.113
and I can hardly imagine the death
and destruction that will follow.

15:40.514 --> 15:42.226
Then what are you suggesting?

15:42.313 --> 15:46.642
You return to the border, hold it fast.
It's where you're needed most.

15:46.729 --> 15:49.525
A party of our best
will be dispatched immediately

15:49.612 --> 15:51.068
to find the princes.

15:51.155 --> 15:54.920
And in case you still doubt my intentions,

15:55.362 --> 15:58.529
I will task my own children,
Soren and Claudia,

15:58.616 --> 16:01.009
with leading the rescue expedition.

16:01.096 --> 16:03.845
I do doubt your intentions.

16:04.079 --> 16:08.558
I will return to the Breach,
but your children won't lead the rescue.

16:08.645 --> 16:11.061
The mission will be assigned to...

16:11.837 --> 16:13.563
Commander Gren.

16:13.881 --> 16:17.567
That's... that's me. I am Commander Gren.

16:27.144 --> 16:30.441
You faced your fear.
Do you feel better about water now?

16:30.528 --> 16:33.313
I have never felt worse about water.

16:33.400 --> 16:35.988
Hmm. Well, anyway,
we're making great time.

16:36.075 --> 16:40.007
Hey, guys? Does anyone else see Bait?

16:50.251 --> 16:54.048
Bait! Come back here!
Do your froggy paddle.

17:02.888 --> 17:05.615
You know you're not supposed to
get in the water.

17:05.723 --> 17:07.222
What a disaster.

17:07.309 --> 17:11.898
I know, right? My socks are all soggy.
A disaster!

17:11.986 --> 17:14.124
A soggy disaster!

17:15.358 --> 17:18.086
Uh, Callum...

17:24.201 --> 17:28.055
Hey, Ocean Rune.
I've never seen it light up before.

17:30.124 --> 17:32.559
Wait, why would the Ocean Rune be...

17:37.720 --> 17:39.358
Oh, I get it!

17:49.310 --> 17:52.871
Ah, sweet, solid land, we meet again.

18:01.530 --> 18:06.328
- Guys, behind you! Bait is in trouble!
- What?

18:06.415 --> 18:08.408
Bait needs help!

18:08.495 --> 18:09.790
Bait sneezed kelp?

18:09.877 --> 18:13.497
No. She says, "Bait's knees smell."

18:13.584 --> 18:14.879
Well, that's just mean.

18:14.966 --> 18:15.966
No!

18:23.302 --> 18:24.930
It's down to me, isn't it?

18:25.017 --> 18:27.239
Of course it is.

18:27.806 --> 18:31.576
Goodbye, sweet, solid land.
I barely knew you.

18:38.150 --> 18:40.112
Come on, Rayla, do it for the frog.

18:40.199 --> 18:42.671
The grumpy frog that hates you.

18:42.988 --> 18:43.989
Here goes.

19:26.240 --> 19:28.530
I have an idea. Rayla, jump!

19:28.617 --> 19:30.772
- But you don't know how to...
- Just jump!

19:54.351 --> 19:58.163
I've sent word to Corvus
that King Harrow has passed.

19:58.647 --> 20:02.167
Is Lord Viren aware
that Corvus has been tracking the princes?

20:02.526 --> 20:03.736
No.

20:04.319 --> 20:06.109
Do not trust Viren.

20:06.196 --> 20:09.159
It may be a month from now,
it may be a year,

20:09.246 --> 20:12.219
but he will stab you in the back.

20:13.537 --> 20:15.096
I'll be careful.

20:37.436 --> 20:41.108
I expect to be notified
when the princes are found. And safe.

20:41.195 --> 20:42.195
Of course.

20:44.234 --> 20:47.003
I'll send word to the Breach immediately.

20:51.533 --> 20:53.991
Oh, Gren, bad news.

20:54.078 --> 20:55.951
There's been a change of plans.

20:56.038 --> 20:59.084
What are you talking about?
What is he talking about?

20:59.171 --> 21:03.714
Oh, I've decided you're off the mission.
Soren will lead the rescue expedition.

21:03.801 --> 21:08.302
What? General Amaya was very specific
that I was to lead this.

21:08.389 --> 21:11.341
Oh, perhaps there was a misunderstanding?

21:11.428 --> 21:14.433
Soren, set up a meeting
for Commander Gren and I

21:14.520 --> 21:17.784
to discuss his concerns.

21:17.893 --> 21:19.563
Somewhere quiet.

21:19.650 --> 21:22.080
Say, around 9:00?

21:22.523 --> 21:26.585
Yes, very good. 9:00 suits my schedule.

21:26.693 --> 21:27.778
Very good.

21:32.533 --> 21:37.429
Rayla, you saved Bait!
Without you, he would have been...

21:37.663 --> 21:40.724
fish food.

21:40.833 --> 21:42.211
That was brave, Rayla.

21:42.298 --> 21:45.167
No, I already told you,
I'm afraid of water.

21:45.254 --> 21:48.008
I know. That's why doing what you did
was so heroic.

21:48.095 --> 21:49.671
Oh, thanks.

21:49.758 --> 21:52.346
Why wouldn't you just tell us
about your fear before?

21:52.433 --> 21:54.863
It's okay to be afraid of things.

21:57.683 --> 22:00.307
I guess I was afraid of being afraid.

22:00.394 --> 22:01.939
Well, that's kind of circular.

22:02.026 --> 22:07.208
But, hey, worth noting: you're not afraid
of being afraid of being afraid.

22:07.317 --> 22:08.487
That's deep.

22:08.574 --> 22:10.211
But stupid.

22:10.320 --> 22:15.160
The thing is, Moonshadow elves
aren't supposed to show fear. Ever.

22:15.247 --> 22:16.453
That's sad.

22:16.540 --> 22:18.428
It's our way.

22:18.996 --> 22:22.913
My parents aren't really dead,
but I wish they were.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.169
They're cowards.

22:24.256 --> 22:25.624
What do you mean?

22:25.711 --> 22:29.419
My parents were part of an elite force,
the Dragon Guard,

22:29.506 --> 22:33.762
eight elven warriors chosen to protect
the egg of the Dragon Prince.

22:33.849 --> 22:37.474
Storm dragons only lay an egg
every thousand years.

22:37.561 --> 22:40.784
So that egg is so rare and precious.

22:41.268 --> 22:43.939
But when the humans came
and killed the Dragon King,

22:44.026 --> 22:48.569
the Dragon Guard, my parents,
failed in their duty.

22:48.656 --> 22:52.504
They ran away. I'm so ashamed.

22:53.280 --> 22:56.216
Rayla, I'm so sorry for what humans did.

22:56.325 --> 22:59.162
So, you see, that's why
I have to make things right.

22:59.249 --> 23:02.332
When I first came here,
I was on a quest for revenge.

23:02.419 --> 23:05.836
But the moment I saw that egg,
everything changed.

23:05.923 --> 23:08.478
Now, this is a journey of redemption.

23:09.212 --> 23:11.383
We're in this together.

23:12.888 --> 23:14.089
Oh, no.

23:14.176 --> 23:16.597
Our boat seems to be drifting away.

23:16.684 --> 23:20.949
It slipped just out of my reach.
What will we do now?

23:25.896 --> 23:29.874
- Goodbye, boat.
- Thank you.

23:32.027 --> 23:34.281
So, what's the deal
with your wrist ribbon thing?

23:34.368 --> 23:35.616
Does it mean something?

23:35.703 --> 23:37.074
Oh, uh...

23:37.658 --> 23:40.078
Nah. It's just decorative.

23:40.165 --> 23:41.199
Decorative?

23:41.286 --> 23:44.625
Yeah. Moonshadow elf thing, I guess.

23:44.712 --> 23:46.708
Mmm. Okay.

23:55.467 --> 23:59.571
Five past 9:00.
I apologize for my tardiness.

23:59.680 --> 24:01.573
It was only five minutes.

24:01.932 --> 24:04.347
So, what are your concerns?

24:04.434 --> 24:05.682
Well...

24:05.769 --> 24:07.189
You took me off the mission.

24:07.276 --> 24:09.811
Hmm, noted. Go on.

24:09.898 --> 24:13.793
And you threw me in this dungeon.

24:13.944 --> 24:17.527
Ah, I see. Anything else?

24:17.614 --> 24:21.536
Uh, no. But... No.
I guess those are the main two.

24:21.623 --> 24:24.498
Thank you. Your feedback is a gift.

24:24.585 --> 24:28.224
Father, it's about our other prisoner...

24:32.876 --> 24:35.228
He's still refusing to eat.

24:35.924 --> 24:40.361
Then let him be hungry.
