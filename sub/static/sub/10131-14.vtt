15:15.874 --> 15:19.001
I just came by to visit

15:15.874 --> 15:19.001
poor, little Stephanie.

15:19.043 --> 15:23.464
Oh, that's very considerate

15:19.043 --> 15:23.464
of you, Karen.

15:23.506 --> 15:26.175
She's missing a real ballerina.

15:26.217 --> 15:29.470
Oh, well, why don't you

15:26.217 --> 15:29.470
go upstairs and say hi?

15:29.512 --> 15:32.682
As you know, Stephanie's<i> very</i>

15:29.512 --> 15:32.682
sick with the chickenpox

15:32.724 --> 15:34.183
and shouldn't be going anywhere.

15:34.225 --> 15:37.395
Chickenpox? I better

15:34.225 --> 15:37.395
get out of here.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.355
Not so fast, Karen.

15:40.732 --> 15:42.066
It's too late.

15:42.108 --> 15:43.651
You probably already

15:42.108 --> 15:43.651
got 'em from me.

15:43.693 --> 15:47.530
Uncle Jesse, you have

15:43.693 --> 15:47.530
the chickenpox too?

15:47.572 --> 15:49.407
What was that, Karen?

15:49.449 --> 15:50.825
I mean..

15:50.867 --> 15:52.285
...Mr. Uncle..

15:52.326 --> 15:53.494
...I mean..

15:53.536 --> 15:56.038
Uncle Cochran.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.833
I mean, Jesse...mister..

15:59.333 --> 16:00.334
I mean..

16:00.376 --> 16:01.502
I..

16:02.754 --> 16:03.880
I..

16:04.839 --> 16:06.382
I can't take it anymore.

16:06.424 --> 16:10.261
It's me. It's me. Stephanie.

16:11.220 --> 16:13.765
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

16:14.474 --> 16:16.225
Stephanie T..

16:16.267 --> 16:18.937
I could have sworn,

16:16.267 --> 16:18.937
it was Lauren Bacall.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.230
Now..

16:21.272 --> 16:23.316
...what are you doing out

16:21.272 --> 16:23.316
of bed, young lady?

16:23.357 --> 16:25.025
I'm all better.

16:25.067 --> 16:26.945
Oh, then, what are those little

16:25.067 --> 16:26.945
bumps all over your face?

16:26.986 --> 16:28.237
Those are..

16:29.196 --> 16:31.950
...my all better bumps.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.494
I wish they were, kid,

16:31.991 --> 16:34.494
but we both know they're not.

16:34.535 --> 16:35.703
Now, come on.

16:35.745 --> 16:37.204
Be careful.

16:35.745 --> 16:37.204
My chicken pox.

16:37.246 --> 16:39.540
Right. Yeah.

16:37.246 --> 16:39.540
I know. I know.

16:39.582 --> 16:42.919
Alright. Now, Steph..

16:42.961 --> 16:46.172
...unfortunately, being

16:42.961 --> 16:46.172
sick sometimes means

16:46.213 --> 16:47.423
having to miss out

16:46.213 --> 16:47.423
on something

16:47.465 --> 16:49.258
that you really

16:47.465 --> 16:49.258
wanna do

16:49.300 --> 16:51.678
but the trick is,

16:49.300 --> 16:51.678
you gotta be tough

16:51.719 --> 16:53.387
like your Uncle Jesse.

16:53.429 --> 16:56.599
Does this mean you don't care

16:53.429 --> 16:56.599
about missing your doo-wop show?

16:58.184 --> 17:00.770
Oh, I got to miss

16:58.184 --> 17:00.770
my doo-wop show.

17:01.813 --> 17:03.356
Remember what you told me?

17:03.397 --> 17:05.358
Be tough. Grr!

17:06.776 --> 17:08.611
Grr.

17:08.653 --> 17:11.197
Come on, kid. I'll get

17:08.653 --> 17:11.197
you some PJs, alright?

17:11.238 --> 17:14.575
Here we go.

17:11.238 --> 17:14.575
The chickenpox twins.

17:14.617 --> 17:17.077
Get the strut down. Get the

17:14.617 --> 17:17.077
chicken strut. That's it.

17:18.204 --> 17:20.247
Joseph, it's just

17:18.204 --> 17:20.247
not fair.

17:20.289 --> 17:21.958
Who ever said

17:20.289 --> 17:21.958
life is fair?

17:22.000 --> 17:24.251
Two grown men dabbing

17:22.000 --> 17:24.251
goop on their bodies.

17:24.293 --> 17:26.004
I call that unfair.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.421
You think this is unfair?

17:27.463 --> 17:29.924
Let's talk about salmon,

17:27.463 --> 17:29.924
shall we?

17:32.051 --> 17:33.720
Salmon wait their

17:32.051 --> 17:33.720
whole lives

17:33.761 --> 17:35.763
to swim hundreds

17:33.761 --> 17:35.763
of miles upstream

17:35.805 --> 17:38.391
make love once

17:35.805 --> 17:38.391
and drop dead.

17:40.852 --> 17:43.604
Now, that is unfair.

17:43.646 --> 17:45.982
What the hell

17:43.646 --> 17:45.982
are you talking about?

17:46.024 --> 17:49.694
I am talking about making

17:46.024 --> 17:49.694
the best of a situation.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.612
Sure, I'm itching

17:51.654 --> 17:54.114
but I'm itching with

17:51.654 --> 17:54.114
a smile on my face.

17:58.118 --> 18:00.621
Itch, dab.

18:00.663 --> 18:03.082
Itch, ha ha! Dab.

18:04.166 --> 18:06.460
Itch, ha!

18:04.166 --> 18:06.460
Dab, dab, dab.

18:07.795 --> 18:11.465
You, my friend,

18:07.795 --> 18:11.465
are a wimp.

18:11.507 --> 18:15.469
You think that because I itch,

18:11.507 --> 18:15.469
I'm a wimp?

18:15.511 --> 18:19.098
No. There's quite a few

18:15.511 --> 18:19.098
other reasons, Joseph.

18:19.139 --> 18:22.936
Let's just see who

18:19.139 --> 18:22.936
scratches first, shall we?

18:22.977 --> 18:24.103
Fine.

18:37.366 --> 18:39.702
Oh, that's a beaut up there

18:37.366 --> 18:39.702
on that forehead of yours.

18:39.744 --> 18:41.037
Yeah?

18:41.079 --> 18:43.497
Bet you'd love to take

18:41.079 --> 18:43.497
a rake to that baby.

18:45.041 --> 18:46.584
Oh, check out that red

18:46.626 --> 18:49.629
throbbing strobe light

18:46.626 --> 18:49.629
on your nose.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.799
'Yeah. Yeah, that one.'

18:52.840 --> 18:54.592
Yeah. If this were

18:52.840 --> 18:54.592
the month of December

18:54.634 --> 18:55.676
you'd find yourself pulling

18:55.718 --> 18:58.679
a sleigh full of toys, pal.

18:58.721 --> 19:01.808
[laughs]

19:02.475 --> 19:04.018
Oh!

19:04.060 --> 19:06.437
You know,

19:04.060 --> 19:06.437
I was wondering

19:06.479 --> 19:09.189
just what I would look

19:06.479 --> 19:09.189
like with a beard.

19:09.231 --> 19:11.358
- Scratching!

19:09.231 --> 19:11.358
- I was wondering!

19:12.652 --> 19:16.447
You know, you got me

19:12.652 --> 19:16.447
wondering a little myself.

19:16.489 --> 19:17.991
I'm feeling

19:16.489 --> 19:17.991
a little hefty.

19:18.032 --> 19:19.700
Uh, Joseph, am I putting on

19:18.032 --> 19:19.700
any weight here?

19:19.742 --> 19:22.202
- Scratching!

19:19.742 --> 19:22.202
- I was wondering!

19:22.244 --> 19:25.748
Just like you, wondering,

19:22.244 --> 19:25.748
wondering, wondering. Even.

19:25.790 --> 19:28.751
Ah, these clothes

19:25.790 --> 19:28.751
are killing me!

19:28.793 --> 19:31.337
Uh! Ah ah ah.

19:31.378 --> 19:34.799
- Ah ah ah.

19:31.378 --> 19:34.799
- Ah! Ah! Ah!

19:35.758 --> 19:38.469
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

19:35.758 --> 19:38.469
You know?

19:38.511 --> 19:39.887
- I got an idea.

19:38.511 --> 19:39.887
- What?

19:39.929 --> 19:42.264
If you scratch me,

19:39.929 --> 19:42.264
and I scratch you

19:42.306 --> 19:44.266
then we're both still

19:42.306 --> 19:44.266
tough guys, right?

19:44.308 --> 19:47.645
Tough yet resourceful.

19:44.308 --> 19:47.645
Get my back!

19:47.687 --> 19:49.647
Get mine. Get mine.

19:49.689 --> 19:50.648
Together. Down.

19:50.690 --> 19:51.774
- Up. Up.

19:50.690 --> 19:51.774
- Down. Down.

19:51.816 --> 19:53.151
- Up. Up.

19:51.816 --> 19:53.151
- Down. Down.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.193
Shoulders. Shoulders.

19:54.234 --> 19:55.820
- Ah!

19:54.234 --> 19:55.820
- Ooh! Oh!

19:55.862 --> 19:57.738
(Jesse)

19:55.862 --> 19:57.738
'Scratch my head,

19:55.862 --> 19:57.738
scratch my head.'

19:57.780 --> 19:59.949
Oh! Oh! Oh!

20:04.411 --> 20:06.122
(both)

20:04.411 --> 20:06.122
Hello.

20:09.416 --> 20:12.503
Hello, Mr. Zuckerman.

20:09.416 --> 20:12.503
Hi, this is Danny Tanner.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.421
Yeah, I desperately

20:12.545 --> 20:14.421
need a baby-sitter.

20:14.463 --> 20:16.298
Is your daughter home?

20:16.340 --> 20:17.383
Oh.

20:17.424 --> 20:19.177
Oh.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.553
Well, how about you?

20:20.594 --> 20:21.762
Have you ever considered

20:20.594 --> 20:21.762
picking up

20:21.804 --> 20:24.306
a little extra

20:21.804 --> 20:24.306
change baby-sitting?

20:24.348 --> 20:25.641
Hello?

20:25.683 --> 20:27.518
- Hello?

20:25.683 --> 20:27.518
- Oh.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.896
Oh, is right.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.896
That's it, Michelle.

20:29.937 --> 20:31.355
The end of the list.

20:31.397 --> 20:32.690
You have any luck?

20:35.484 --> 20:37.111
Don't tease me like that.

20:37.695 --> 20:39.655
I'm dead.

20:39.697 --> 20:42.324
Unless I call up

20:39.697 --> 20:42.324
Sally Penzo's house

20:42.366 --> 20:44.118
and get ahold of D.J.,

20:42.366 --> 20:44.118
before she goes to

20:44.160 --> 20:45.953
Carmel for the slumber party.

20:45.995 --> 20:48.748
Yeah, then, she could

20:45.995 --> 20:48.748
make it back in time

20:48.789 --> 20:50.457
and I could get

20:48.789 --> 20:50.457
to my game.

20:51.458 --> 20:52.835
'Oh, but, Michelle'

20:52.877 --> 20:54.921
she's been looking

20:52.877 --> 20:54.921
forward to this for weeks.

20:54.962 --> 20:57.631
It's her very first

20:54.962 --> 20:57.631
slumber party.

20:57.673 --> 21:00.218
But then again, it's my

20:57.673 --> 21:00.218
very first Warriors game.

21:01.886 --> 21:03.512
Ah, but if she misses

21:01.886 --> 21:03.512
that party

21:03.554 --> 21:05.598
it's-it's gonna

21:03.554 --> 21:05.598
break her heart.

21:05.639 --> 21:09.518
What do you think, Michelle?

21:05.639 --> 21:09.518
Should I call up D.J. or not?

21:09.560 --> 21:12.146
[Michelle mumbling]

21:12.188 --> 21:14.023
Very tempting.

21:14.065 --> 21:15.733
But I just can't

21:14.065 --> 21:15.733
do that to D.J.

21:16.817 --> 21:18.569
'We could still

21:16.817 --> 21:18.569
play, though.'

21:18.611 --> 21:20.654
Yeah. Let's call

21:18.611 --> 21:20.654
each other.

21:21.655 --> 21:24.575
Hello, Michelle.

21:21.655 --> 21:24.575
Hi, it's daddy.

21:29.747 --> 21:31.582
You hung up on your father?

21:35.920 --> 21:37.004
Ooh!

21:38.338 --> 21:39.673
Ah!

21:39.715 --> 21:41.259

I'm not hungry.

22:16.169 --> 22:18.045
- Jesse.

22:16.169 --> 22:18.045
- Me neither.

22:18.087 --> 22:19.255
Steph?

22:19.297 --> 22:20.714
I'm nauseous.

22:21.340 --> 22:22.424
Ah..

22:23.843 --> 22:26.053
Ah, slide over.

22:26.846 --> 22:28.139
Ah! Ah! Aw!

22:29.890 --> 22:31.558
I'm not

22:29.890 --> 22:31.558
going anywhere.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.269
No sitter?

22:33.311 --> 22:35.479
Just the one

22:33.311 --> 22:35.479
you're looking at.

22:35.521 --> 22:37.564
I can't believe

22:35.521 --> 22:37.564
I'm gonna miss my game.

22:39.150 --> 22:41.443
[sighs]

22:43.029 --> 22:44.030
Hi, everybody.

22:44.071 --> 22:45.323
- Hey.

22:44.071 --> 22:45.323
- D.J.

22:45.363 --> 22:46.991
D.J., what are

22:45.363 --> 22:46.991
you doing here?

22:47.033 --> 22:48.993
I wanted to make sure

22:47.033 --> 22:48.993
you got a baby-sitter.

22:49.035 --> 22:50.244
Need one?

22:50.286 --> 22:52.246
Yes. Oh, thank you.

22:50.286 --> 22:52.246
Thank you.

22:52.288 --> 22:53.831
Thank you. Thank you.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.749
Well, dad, you better leave.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.749
You're gonna be late.

22:55.791 --> 22:58.418
No. I might just

22:55.791 --> 22:58.418
make it now. Mwah!

22:58.460 --> 23:01.130
Is this a terrific

22:58.460 --> 23:01.130
kid or what?

23:01.172 --> 23:03.465
You gave up your

23:01.172 --> 23:03.465
slumber party for me?

23:03.507 --> 23:06.593
Ah, D.J., thank you. Thank you,

23:03.507 --> 23:06.593
thank you. Thank you.

23:06.635 --> 23:08.971
Yeah, but there'll

23:06.635 --> 23:08.971
be other parties.

23:09.013 --> 23:11.224
Dad, you do

23:09.013 --> 23:11.224
so much for me.

23:11.265 --> 23:14.185
This is my chance to do

23:11.265 --> 23:14.185
something nice for you.

23:14.227 --> 23:16.770
Isn't that what being part

23:14.227 --> 23:16.770
of a family's all about?

23:17.563 --> 23:20.149
Do you hear this?

23:20.191 --> 23:22.026
You really are growing up.

23:22.068 --> 23:23.569
It's not fun.

23:23.610 --> 23:26.530
D.J., you're becoming very

23:23.610 --> 23:26.530
mature and responsible.

23:26.572 --> 23:28.866
Yeah. I guess having

23:26.572 --> 23:28.866
me for an uncle

23:28.908 --> 23:31.493
is starting to

23:28.908 --> 23:31.493
rub off on you, D.J.

23:31.535 --> 23:34.205
Uncle Jesse,

23:31.535 --> 23:34.205
you're delirious.

23:34.247 --> 23:35.413
Well, dad, if you're

23:34.247 --> 23:35.413
not gonna leave

23:35.455 --> 23:36.749
then I'm going back

23:35.455 --> 23:36.749
to the party.

23:36.790 --> 23:38.667
Oh, I'm out of here.

23:36.790 --> 23:38.667
I'm out of here.

23:38.709 --> 23:41.670
I am just so honored

23:38.709 --> 23:41.670
to be part of this family.

23:41.712 --> 23:44.590
Guys, we really are

23:41.712 --> 23:44.590
doing something right.

23:44.631 --> 23:46.384
D.J, you are one

23:44.631 --> 23:46.384
terrific kid.

23:46.424 --> 23:47.760
Thank you,

23:46.424 --> 23:47.760
thank you, thank you!

23:47.801 --> 23:49.511
- Dad, I'm leaving.

23:47.801 --> 23:49.511
- I'm gone. I'm gone.

23:49.553 --> 23:51.389
Thank you. Bye!

23:52.472 --> 23:55.268
The man loves to hug.

23:55.309 --> 23:57.311
Well, you guys don't

23:55.309 --> 23:57.311
need anything, do you?

23:57.353 --> 23:58.896
Yeah. Get my guitar.

23:58.938 --> 24:01.065
Yeah. I'd like

23:58.938 --> 24:01.065
my coloring books and..

24:01.107 --> 24:02.440

24:01.107 --> 24:02.440
'Some cranberry juice.

24:01.107 --> 24:02.440
Get me orange juice and..'

24:02.482 --> 24:04.318
