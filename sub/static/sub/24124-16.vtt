WEBVTT

00:00.291 --> 00:03.291
I gotta get goin'

00:03.291 --> 00:06.875
a friend of mine

00:08.500 --> 00:11.333
he's just Pooh Bear

00:13.875 --> 00:17.458
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.458 --> 00:21.000
I know he's out there

00:24.458 --> 00:27.875
we're so adventurous

00:27.875 --> 00:31.083
and again

00:31.083 --> 00:34.833
and there's nobody home

00:34.833 --> 00:38.250
to count on a friend

00:38.250 --> 00:41.708
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.833 --> 00:45.250
take me, please?

00:45.250 --> 00:48.708
I got to be there

00:50.708 --> 00:55.875
Winnie the Pooh

01:17.250 --> 01:20.083
Christopher Robin,
is that twinkly one

01:20.083 --> 01:23.250
really your very own
wishing star?

01:23.250 --> 01:24.708
Really?

01:24.708 --> 01:28.000
Ha ha! Oh, yes, Pooh.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.500
Uh,

01:29.500 --> 01:32.166
would you like to wish
for something?

01:32.166 --> 01:35.458
Oh! Very, very much.

01:35.458 --> 01:39.000
Then you have to say
the special wishing rhyme.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.333
But I don't know
the special
wishing rhyme.

01:42.333 --> 01:44.083
Silly old bear.

01:44.083 --> 01:46.708
That's because
I haven't told you yet.

01:48.250 --> 01:49.458
Oh.

01:49.458 --> 01:50.625
Now remember,

01:50.625 --> 01:52.583
you have to flap like a bird,

01:52.583 --> 01:54.583
jump like a fish,

01:54.583 --> 01:57.125
sit down, stand up,

01:57.125 --> 01:59.250
wish, wish, wish.

01:59.250 --> 02:00.875
Flap like a bird,

02:00.875 --> 02:03.458
jump like a, uh, fish.

02:03.458 --> 02:04.750
Oof.

02:04.750 --> 02:08.250
Uh, sit down, stand up,

02:08.250 --> 02:10.875
wish, wish, wish.

02:10.875 --> 02:13.750
You got to
cover your eyes, Pooh.

02:15.250 --> 02:17.333
I wish for something sweet.

02:17.333 --> 02:18.875
Uh, for me.

02:22.291 --> 02:24.458
Why, look, Pooh.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.333
Oh, my goodness!

02:29.333 --> 02:31.208
It really works!

02:31.208 --> 02:34.333
Now I wish for
a pot for Piglet

02:34.333 --> 02:35.458
and one for me

02:35.458 --> 02:37.000
and a pot for Rabbit

02:37.000 --> 02:38.708
and another one for me

02:38.708 --> 02:40.375
and one for Tigger and, uh--

02:40.375 --> 02:43.500
Oh, no, Pooh. You don't
want to do that.

02:43.500 --> 02:45.708
- I don't?
- Oh, no.

02:45.708 --> 02:49.375
You see, it's a very
small wishing star.

02:49.375 --> 02:53.083
And, uh, too many wishes
might wear it out.

02:53.083 --> 02:55.416
Aww.

02:55.416 --> 02:58.166
Then can we come back
tomorrow night?

02:58.166 --> 03:00.125
Of course we can.

03:05.958 --> 03:09.000
I think
he winked at me.

03:17.708 --> 03:19.208
Oh, bother.

03:19.208 --> 03:22.333
My wish is empty.

03:22.333 --> 03:24.583
But tonight I'll get more.

03:25.875 --> 03:29.166
Because I shall
fly like a bird,

03:29.166 --> 03:30.875
swim like a fish,

03:30.875 --> 03:33.416
uh, dum dee dee, uh, dum dum,

03:33.416 --> 03:36.166
wish, wish, uh, wish.

03:36.166 --> 03:38.375
Oh, my goodness.

03:38.375 --> 03:40.458
I think I've forgotten
the wishing rhyme.

03:40.458 --> 03:45.583
This is going to take
some very large remembering.

04:01.208 --> 04:03.083
Oh, d-d-dear.

04:04.875 --> 04:10.250
Um, hop like a bunny,
dig like a...

04:10.250 --> 04:12.208
- Yaah!
- No, that's not it.

04:13.416 --> 04:16.500
Oh! Yipe!

04:23.833 --> 04:25.000
Hello, Pooh Bear.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.583
I'm building
my very own snowman,

04:27.583 --> 04:29.583
all by myself.

04:29.583 --> 04:31.416
That's a very big job

04:31.416 --> 04:33.958
for such a very small
animal, Piglet.

04:35.583 --> 04:38.083
Yes. I think so, too.

04:38.083 --> 04:39.458
And what are you doing?

04:39.458 --> 04:41.125
I'm trying to remember.

04:41.125 --> 04:42.583
Oh.

04:45.083 --> 04:46.458
R-Remember what?

04:46.458 --> 04:50.458
I forget.

04:50.458 --> 04:52.583
But it has something to do

04:52.583 --> 04:56.875
with Christopher Robin's
wishing star.

04:56.875 --> 04:58.458
Wishing star?

04:58.458 --> 05:01.208
Oh, Christopher Robin
has a wishing star?

05:01.208 --> 05:05.000
Do you think I could wish
for a-- a snowman?

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
I don't see why not, Piglet.

05:09.500 --> 05:10.750
Tigger: Hmm.

05:11.875 --> 05:13.458
Good move.

05:13.458 --> 05:15.375
But not good enough.

05:17.625 --> 05:19.458
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

05:19.458 --> 05:21.458
King Kong me.

05:22.625 --> 05:25.208
Ha ha! I win! I win!

05:25.208 --> 05:27.208
I-- Ha ha! Uh...

05:27.208 --> 05:28.750
I always win.

05:28.750 --> 05:31.000
Boy, this sure is boring.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.333
If only there was two of me.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.875
Then things would be fun.

05:34.875 --> 05:37.875
Hmm. Let me see.

05:37.875 --> 05:39.625
Walk like a turtle,

05:39.625 --> 05:43.333
uh, dance like a worm...

05:43.333 --> 05:46.416
No, not that, either.

05:47.458 --> 05:48.583
Oof!

05:48.583 --> 05:50.500
Why, hello, Tigger.

05:50.500 --> 05:52.000
Hiya, buddy bear.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
You guys want to play?
Huh? Huh?

05:55.000 --> 05:57.166
We can't, Tigger.
We're going to wish

05:57.166 --> 05:58.875
on Christopher Robin's
wishing star.

05:58.875 --> 06:01.875
Wait a minute. A wishing star!

06:01.875 --> 06:04.583
I could wish for another
tigger to play with.

06:04.583 --> 06:08.083
Oh, Pooh, can I wish, too?
Can I? Can I?

06:08.083 --> 06:11.875
Well, you see,
I can't quite remember--

06:11.875 --> 06:14.208
Oh, thanks, buddy bear.

06:14.208 --> 06:15.583
I can hardly wait.

06:15.583 --> 06:17.416
A friend. A companion.

06:17.416 --> 06:19.416
Someone to compare
stripes with.

06:19.416 --> 06:20.875
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

06:20.875 --> 06:23.833
Buzz like a bee...

06:23.833 --> 06:26.000
Oh, bother.

06:31.166 --> 06:35.375
I just love vegetable soup.

06:35.375 --> 06:37.000
Ah.

06:38.583 --> 06:39.708
Oh, boy.

06:41.291 --> 06:42.708
Carrots!

06:46.000 --> 06:47.083
Hey!

06:49.708 --> 06:53.125
Try to steal
my vegetables, will you?

06:53.125 --> 06:54.750
Yaah!

06:57.125 --> 06:59.708
And don't come back, you--

07:01.166 --> 07:04.083
Oh, my. Oh, my!

07:04.083 --> 07:06.708
Hmm, flap like an armadillo.

07:06.708 --> 07:07.875
Uh, no.

07:07.875 --> 07:09.708
Uh, flap like a pig.

07:09.708 --> 07:11.750
- No.
- Rabbit: Back! Back!

07:11.750 --> 07:13.458
My goodness.

07:13.458 --> 07:14.833
Tigger: Oh, no.

07:14.833 --> 07:17.166
Bunny boy's outnumbered
a jillion to 1.

07:17.166 --> 07:18.583
What do we do?

07:18.583 --> 07:21.333
Uh, perhaps I should, uh...

07:21.333 --> 07:22.708
build a snowman?

07:27.291 --> 07:29.458
What now?

07:29.458 --> 07:31.458
Yaah!

07:31.458 --> 07:34.333
Retreat!

07:37.833 --> 07:39.833
Well, Rabbit, ha ha,

07:39.833 --> 07:42.583
I guess Piglet got rid
of those buggy boys.

07:42.583 --> 07:45.625
Yes, he certainly
did that.

07:45.625 --> 07:48.708
But they'll be back.

07:48.708 --> 07:50.708
I wish there were some way

07:50.708 --> 07:53.625
to keep them
out of my house for good.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.166
Excuse me, Rabbit,

07:56.166 --> 07:57.708
but did you say wish?

07:57.708 --> 07:59.958
Why, Pooh's got a wishing
star, and perhaps--

07:59.958 --> 08:01.750
A wishing star?

08:01.750 --> 08:06.291
Why, I could wish
for no more bugs in my house.

08:06.291 --> 08:08.291
In the Hundred Acre Wood.

08:08.291 --> 08:09.833
In the world!

08:11.333 --> 08:14.166
Oh, how wonderful. Hmm-hmm.

08:14.166 --> 08:18.291
Yes, except for one thing.

08:18.291 --> 08:20.375
Oh. What, Pooh?

08:20.375 --> 08:22.625
- Yes, what, Pooh?
- Yeah, what, Pooh?

08:22.625 --> 08:25.458
I can't remember
how to make a wish.

08:25.458 --> 08:26.500
What?

08:27.583 --> 08:30.208
He's got walking amnesia!

08:30.208 --> 08:31.750
Don't worry
about a thing, Pooh.

08:31.750 --> 08:33.583
No sooner mentioned
than remembered.

08:33.583 --> 08:36.083
We'll have that very little
brain drained in no time.

08:36.083 --> 08:38.500
Both: We'll cure it!

08:38.500 --> 08:42.000
Why, thank you, I think.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.625
Well,
getting your memory back

08:44.625 --> 08:46.375
is like losing
the hiccups.

08:46.375 --> 08:48.625
You just have
to scare the person.

08:48.625 --> 08:53.250
Raah!

08:53.250 --> 08:54.416
Oh, bother.

08:54.416 --> 08:56.708
Quickly, Pooh.
What do you remember?

08:56.708 --> 08:59.416
Well, I remember
that your house

08:59.416 --> 09:02.416
used to be a lot
cleaner than this.

09:05.083 --> 09:06.500
Tigger: So you see,

09:06.500 --> 09:08.583
his memories have probably
all slipped to his feet.

09:08.583 --> 09:11.458
Ipso facto, if we
turn him upside-down,

09:11.458 --> 09:13.500
the memories will
rush back to his head,

09:13.500 --> 09:15.750
heh heh,
where they belong.

09:15.750 --> 09:19.000
Do you remember who I am,
buddy bear?

09:19.000 --> 09:22.375
Why, yes. You're Tigger.

09:22.375 --> 09:24.500
It worked! It worked!

09:24.500 --> 09:27.500
But I've always remembered
who you are, Tigger.

09:27.500 --> 09:31.083
Oh, yeah. ha ha.
I forgot.

09:31.083 --> 09:33.083
I forgot? Say,

09:33.083 --> 09:34.875
you don't think
this forgetting stuff

09:34.875 --> 09:37.583
is contagerous, do you?

09:37.583 --> 09:39.583
Now, Pooh,
stand up.

09:39.583 --> 09:42.583
This hot water bottle will
warm up your memories,

09:42.583 --> 09:45.583
and they'll just float
to the top of your head.

09:47.458 --> 09:49.333
Sit down, Pooh boy,

09:49.333 --> 09:51.583
and take a load
off your mind.

09:51.583 --> 09:52.708
He should stand up.

09:52.708 --> 09:54.833
Tigger: Sit down.

09:56.291 --> 09:59.375
Stand up, sit down.

09:59.375 --> 10:01.458
Stand up...

10:01.458 --> 10:04.875
Wait. Look.

10:04.875 --> 10:08.625
Flap like a bird,
jump like a fish,

10:08.625 --> 10:10.583
sit down, stand up,

10:10.583 --> 10:12.708
wish, wish, wish.

10:12.708 --> 10:14.958
I got it. I got it!

10:14.958 --> 10:18.083
- He's got it. He's got it.

10:18.083 --> 10:20.458
You said it! Ha ha ha!

10:20.458 --> 10:22.583
Quick, what time is it?

10:22.583 --> 10:24.416
Half past dark.

10:24.416 --> 10:28.000
Come on!
To the wishing star!

10:29.000 --> 10:30.583
Oh, bother.

10:32.958 --> 10:36.250
It's awfully hungry
out tonight.

10:36.250 --> 10:38.000
I do hope I'm not too late.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.083
- Rabbit: Flap like a bird!
- Tigger: Jump like a fish!

10:40.083 --> 10:41.458
Piglet:
Sit down, stand up.

10:41.458 --> 10:43.458
All: Wish, wish, wish!

10:43.458 --> 10:46.125
I wish I had another
Tigger to play with.

10:46.125 --> 10:49.458
I wish those bugs
would go away forever!

10:49.458 --> 10:52.750
I wish I could build my own
snowman all by myself.

10:54.958 --> 10:57.458
Good night, Pooh Bear,
and thank you.

10:57.458 --> 11:00.166
Yeah.
Thanks, buddy bear.

11:00.166 --> 11:02.458
You're a real friend.

11:05.291 --> 11:09.000
I wonder how many wishes
a star can give.

11:09.000 --> 11:13.458
Oh, I'm sure
one more little pot
of honey can't hurt.

11:15.166 --> 11:18.166
Flap like a bird,
jump like a fish,

11:18.166 --> 11:19.875
sit down, stand up,

11:19.875 --> 11:22.625
wish, wish, wish.

11:26.125 --> 11:27.875
Wishing star?

11:27.875 --> 11:30.583
Oh, wishing star!

11:33.625 --> 11:35.083
Oh, my!

11:35.083 --> 11:37.375
Christopher Robin's star!

11:37.375 --> 11:40.166
I wished him out!

11:48.208 --> 11:51.583
Oh, dear. I wished too hard.

11:51.583 --> 11:53.458
The star's gone,

11:53.458 --> 11:57.000
and before my friends could
get their wishes, too.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.083
There's only one thing to do.

12:00.083 --> 12:03.625
If the wishing star can't
make their wishes come true,

12:03.625 --> 12:05.250
then I will.

12:06.250 --> 12:07.250
I hope.

12:08.708 --> 12:12.000
Now, how shall I make
a snowman for Piglet

12:12.000 --> 12:14.291
without him
knowing it was me?

12:14.291 --> 12:16.500
- Piglet: Yaah!
- Oh, bother.

12:26.125 --> 12:29.375
Oh, my goodness.
My wish has come true.

12:29.375 --> 12:32.291
I made a snowman
all by myself.

12:32.291 --> 12:34.875
I can't wait to show
him to Pooh Bear.

12:34.875 --> 12:36.500
That was easy.

12:36.500 --> 12:39.708
Now to find Tigger.

12:39.708 --> 12:44.000
Yoo-hoo! Other Tigger!

12:44.000 --> 12:46.250
Waiting for your wish
is exhausperating.

12:46.250 --> 12:49.000
You in there, Tigger boy?

12:49.000 --> 12:50.750
Hmm, how about here?

12:50.750 --> 12:54.458
Here I am, Tig--
uh, buddy boy.

12:54.458 --> 12:56.750
Hmm. Oh, you don't say.

12:56.750 --> 12:59.291
Hmm, yeah. Oh.

12:59.291 --> 13:02.333
You do look
sort of familiar.

13:02.333 --> 13:07.125
But are you sure you're
a T-I-double Guh-Er?

13:07.125 --> 13:09.416
Oh course I'm a tigger.

13:09.416 --> 13:12.166
Have stripes. See?

13:12.166 --> 13:14.833
You're right.
You are a tigger!

13:14.833 --> 13:17.875
Come on. I'll race you
to that tree.

13:17.875 --> 13:22.000
All right.
On your mark, get set--

13:22.000 --> 13:23.416
Go!

13:23.416 --> 13:25.500
Now for Rabbit's wish.

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
You know, that guy's
kind of slow for a tigger.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.291
Then again,
maybe he's so fast,

13:35.291 --> 13:38.333
he's already here and gone.

13:38.333 --> 13:41.458
Hey, buddy boy, come on out!

13:41.458 --> 13:43.833
Ally ally oxen tree!

13:43.833 --> 13:45.208
Batter, bugs.

13:53.375 --> 13:55.500
Uh, excuse me, please,

13:55.500 --> 13:59.083
but I know where there's
some large vegetable--

13:59.083 --> 14:01.333
uh, vegebabbles--

14:01.333 --> 14:03.875
some, uh, really big food.

14:03.875 --> 14:05.833
-

14:05.833 --> 14:09.125
Yes? Did someone knock?

14:09.125 --> 14:12.083
Ah, certainly is
getting dark early.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.083
There you are.

14:16.083 --> 14:17.416
Help yourselves.

14:17.416 --> 14:19.416
- Oh!
- Wow!

14:34.375 --> 14:37.000
Hello, Pooh. I've been
looking all over for you.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.583
I want to show you
my new snowman.

14:39.583 --> 14:41.875
I'd love to see it,
Piglet.

14:41.875 --> 14:43.583
I'll be along
just as soon

14:43.583 --> 14:45.208
as I finish
cheering up some of--

14:45.208 --> 14:47.458
of R-Rabbit's friends.

14:47.458 --> 14:49.000
Thank you, Pooh.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.500
Pooh, if you don't mind
my asking,

14:51.500 --> 14:52.583
what is that?

14:52.583 --> 14:54.875
Oh. Uh, this?

14:54.875 --> 14:58.875
Well, uh, it's
to keep sharks away.

14:58.875 --> 15:01.750
Sharks? Where? Where?

15:03.125 --> 15:04.375
Don't worry, Piglet.

15:04.375 --> 15:07.000
I haven't seen any
around all day.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.083
Oh, dear. I do hope

15:09.083 --> 15:11.500
the sharks haven't
eaten my snowman.

15:11.500 --> 15:14.416
Piglet's
snowman. Better hurry.

15:14.416 --> 15:18.416
Ha ha ha ha! Trying
to disguise yourself, huh?

15:18.416 --> 15:20.458
Well, it won't work.

15:20.458 --> 15:21.708
It won't?

15:21.708 --> 15:23.083
Nah. Ha ha!

15:23.083 --> 15:24.500
You can't fool me

15:24.500 --> 15:25.875
with one of those
Pooh shirts.

15:25.875 --> 15:28.333
Ha ha ha!
You old tigger, you.

15:28.333 --> 15:29.708
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

15:29.708 --> 15:32.291
I should have known
better, Tigger.

15:32.291 --> 15:35.458
And hoo hoo hoo hoo,

15:35.458 --> 15:37.291
uh, to you, too.

15:37.291 --> 15:38.708
So why didn't you tell me

15:38.708 --> 15:41.458
you wanted to play
hide and don't speak?

15:41.458 --> 15:44.458
What a wonderful idea.

15:44.458 --> 15:48.083
I'll count,
and you hide.

15:48.083 --> 15:50.625
1, 2...

15:50.625 --> 15:53.583
uh, the number after 2,

15:53.583 --> 15:55.583
4, 5...

15:55.583 --> 15:57.458
I love this game.

16:03.291 --> 16:05.458
Ooh.

16:05.458 --> 16:08.000
I know I left him
right around here--

16:08.000 --> 16:09.625
-- somewhere.

16:09.625 --> 16:11.750
Oh, bother.

16:16.333 --> 16:17.250
Pooh?

16:17.250 --> 16:19.125
Oh, my snowman!

16:20.125 --> 16:21.750
I thought I'd lost you.

16:23.291 --> 16:24.750
If I didn't know
better,

16:24.750 --> 16:26.333
I'd say your teeth
were chattering.

16:26.333 --> 16:28.708
Oh, my g-g-goodness.

16:28.708 --> 16:30.375
You are cold.

16:30.375 --> 16:33.708
Don't worry.
I'll be right back.

16:33.708 --> 16:36.500
Being a snowman is
certainly a chilly job,

16:36.500 --> 16:39.583
- not to mention cold.
-

16:44.000 --> 16:46.125
Oh, bother.

16:54.250 --> 16:56.583
There. No more vegetables,

16:56.583 --> 16:58.125
no more bugs.

16:58.125 --> 17:00.208
Hey, Tigger, I found you!

17:00.208 --> 17:01.333
Oh, dear.

17:01.333 --> 17:03.250
Now it's your turn to hide.

17:04.833 --> 17:07.416
Hmm. Guess we're
playing tag now.

17:07.416 --> 17:10.208
Here I come, like it or not!

17:11.458 --> 17:13.375
Uh-oh.

17:20.083 --> 17:22.000
My vegetables!

17:22.000 --> 17:23.625
How did they get here?

17:23.625 --> 17:25.416
Stroke! Stroke, stroke.

17:25.416 --> 17:27.000
And stroke, stroke,
stroke.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.875
And stroke, stroke,
stroke. And--

17:28.875 --> 17:31.291
Wishing star. Hmm.

17:31.291 --> 17:33.875
My wish didn't come true.

17:33.875 --> 17:36.875
I have a carrot to pick
with you, Pooh Bear.

17:38.875 --> 17:41.875
This wish come truing
is very tiring.

17:41.875 --> 17:44.416
No wonder the wishing
star got pooped.

17:44.416 --> 17:46.375
Piglet: Snowman!

17:46.375 --> 17:49.458
Where are you?

17:49.458 --> 17:50.708
It's Piglet.

17:50.708 --> 17:52.875
I'm coming,
other Tigger!

17:52.875 --> 17:54.000
And Tigger.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Rabbit: Pooh Bear!

18:00.208 --> 18:02.291
Oh. Heh heh. There you are.

18:02.291 --> 18:05.458
And you're not
shaking anymore.

18:05.458 --> 18:06.291
Good.

18:06.291 --> 18:08.291
I brought you a face.

18:09.625 --> 18:11.708
Very distinguished.

18:11.708 --> 18:12.958
Hiya, little Piglet.

18:12.958 --> 18:14.250
You haven't seen
another tigger

18:14.250 --> 18:15.416
around here, have you?

18:15.416 --> 18:17.708
Why, no, Tigger,
only you.

18:17.708 --> 18:20.291
Ha ha. That's because
you're the only one.

18:20.291 --> 18:23.583
All right, where is he?
Where's Pooh?

18:23.583 --> 18:25.166
I haven't seen him, Rabbit.

18:25.166 --> 18:26.875
Pooh: Uh...uh...

18:26.875 --> 18:29.833
Say, what's wrong with
your snowman's schnozzola?

18:29.833 --> 18:32.125
Uh...uh-choo!

18:37.750 --> 18:39.750
All: Pooh Bear!

18:39.750 --> 18:42.166
All right, Pooh,

18:42.166 --> 18:46.125
I think you have
some explaining to do.

18:47.125 --> 18:48.958
And because it was my wish

18:48.958 --> 18:50.583
that pooped the star,

18:50.583 --> 18:52.000
I had to do something

18:52.000 --> 18:54.500
to make your wishes come true.

18:54.500 --> 18:57.583
But, Pooh, what happens
when Christopher Robin comes

18:57.583 --> 18:59.500
to ask the wishing star
for a wish?

18:59.500 --> 19:02.375
Christopher Robin!

19:02.375 --> 19:04.208
We can't let him know

19:04.208 --> 19:06.375
what I did
to his wishing star.

19:06.375 --> 19:10.125
He'd-- He'd never
speak to me again.

19:10.125 --> 19:13.291
Yeah. Bu what can we do,
Pooh boy?

19:13.291 --> 19:15.166
I'm not sure,

19:15.166 --> 19:18.708
but there's going to be
a wishing star tonight,

19:18.708 --> 19:21.000
or my name isn't
Winnie the Pooh,

19:21.000 --> 19:23.166
which it is.

19:24.583 --> 19:26.000
Do you think,

19:26.000 --> 19:27.500
if I'm far enough away,

19:27.500 --> 19:31.500
that Christopher Robin
will believe I'm a star?

19:31.500 --> 19:35.083
Sure. Just remember
to look twinkly.

19:35.083 --> 19:37.166
But, Pooh,

19:37.166 --> 19:39.458
why must you go so very up?

19:39.458 --> 19:43.083
Because otherwise I'll let
Christopher Robin down.

19:44.458 --> 19:46.875
Goodbye, Pooh Bear.

19:48.333 --> 19:51.208
Yeah. So long.

19:51.208 --> 19:53.166
Be sure to write.

19:53.166 --> 19:55.375
If you ever learn how.

19:55.375 --> 19:57.875
Are you ready, Pooh?

19:57.875 --> 20:00.000
Well--

20:00.000 --> 20:01.208
Fire!

20:01.208 --> 20:04.166
Whoa!

20:04.166 --> 20:07.000
Adiós,buddy bear!

20:07.000 --> 20:09.833
Ooh!

20:12.250 --> 20:15.875
Oh, bother! Here comes
Christopher Robin!

20:15.875 --> 20:19.000
Hello, Christopher Robin.

20:19.000 --> 20:24.250
Ahem. The wishing star
is over here, uh, tonight.

20:26.083 --> 20:27.958
Why, so you are.

20:27.958 --> 20:30.875
But what are you
doing there?

20:30.875 --> 20:33.458
Well, I came down
for a closer look,

20:33.458 --> 20:36.250
and this tree grabbed me.

20:36.250 --> 20:40.000
But do make a wish.
I can hear you just fine.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.416
I'm sure you can.

20:42.416 --> 20:45.708
Flap like a bird,
jump like a fish,

20:45.708 --> 20:47.958
sit down, stand up,

20:47.958 --> 20:49.458
wish, wish, wish.

20:49.458 --> 20:51.083
I wish--

20:51.083 --> 20:53.958
I wish I had my
best friend beside me.

20:55.583 --> 20:58.000
- Whoops.
- Gotcha.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.875
Why, Pooh. My wish came true.

21:01.875 --> 21:04.166
But how can that be?

21:04.166 --> 21:06.625
The wishing star's
been used up.

21:06.625 --> 21:08.708
Christopher Robin,

21:08.708 --> 21:11.833
I wore him out,
and he fell.

21:11.833 --> 21:13.083
See?

21:13.083 --> 21:16.333
Silly old bear, look.

21:18.583 --> 21:22.750
You mean the wishing star
was there all the time?

21:22.750 --> 21:25.833
All your friends' wishes
came true. Didn't they?

21:25.833 --> 21:29.625
Well, yes. But I thought
I did them.

21:29.625 --> 21:33.000
Maybe with a little help
from the wishing star.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.833
Stars certainly are smart.

21:35.833 --> 21:38.000
Let's go home, Pooh.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.625
Maybe that honey pot
you wished for last night

21:40.625 --> 21:41.958
is full again.

21:44.291 --> 21:46.500
I want to thank
the wishing star.

21:46.500 --> 21:50.250
He made my most
important wish come true.

21:50.250 --> 21:52.375
What wish is that?

21:53.875 --> 21:55.000
You.
