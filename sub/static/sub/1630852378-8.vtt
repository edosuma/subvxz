Ji Tae.

00:38.961 --> 00:40.379
(Episode 8: An Ending)

00:40.380 --> 00:41.758
I'm curious though.

00:41.759 --> 00:43.259
(Episode 8: An Ending)

00:50.350 --> 00:52.520
Do you really believe that I didn't kill her?

00:55.020 --> 00:56.100
Hong Guk Hwa, I mean.

01:09.700 --> 01:11.079
What if I did though?

01:26.170 --> 01:28.799
I don't care to know whether or not you killed her.

01:30.599 --> 01:31.969
What I do know...

01:33.310 --> 01:35.640
is what you're like in here. Nothing more or less.

01:53.659 --> 01:55.869
You are Ms. Hong's stepfather and the only person...

01:55.870 --> 01:57.540
with the right to inherit her assets.

01:58.250 --> 02:00.539
- Correct. - When did you receive...

02:00.540 --> 02:02.749
Ms. Hong's postmortem report?

02:02.750 --> 02:04.128
(Witness)

02:04.129 --> 02:06.840
Two days after her death. The NFS sent it to me.

02:08.879 --> 02:11.259
Then you made an insurance claim right away on the same day...

02:12.009 --> 02:13.969
to get the payout.

02:14.219 --> 02:16.389
I was in urgent need of money at the time.

02:16.520 --> 02:18.310
I see. Immediately after her death,

02:18.639 --> 02:20.978
you received an insurance payout of 700,000 dollars...

02:20.979 --> 02:23.899
and took legal steps to inherit her assets and properties.

02:23.900 --> 02:26.689
Her house is valued at five million dollars.

02:27.240 --> 02:29.110
In less than five days after her death,

02:29.990 --> 02:31.569
you put the house up for sale.

02:32.370 --> 02:34.780
I understand what you're trying to get at,

02:34.870 --> 02:36.449
but those who are alive must go on living.

02:41.169 --> 02:42.250
Then,

02:42.960 --> 02:45.879
when you heard that she had died,

02:46.919 --> 02:50.009
were you sad? Or did your excitement outweigh it?

02:54.680 --> 02:56.430
I'll be honest. There was a little bit of that,

02:56.930 --> 02:58.639
but I'm not a total jerk.

03:06.780 --> 03:08.280
On the day of the incident,

03:09.530 --> 03:12.069
between 12 to 4am,

03:13.409 --> 03:15.330
where were you? And what were you doing?

03:17.289 --> 03:19.409
Do I have to answer this question?

03:19.620 --> 03:21.620
Yes, I must hear your answer.

03:23.580 --> 03:25.539
I was at a motel with my girlfriend.

03:25.750 --> 03:27.419
I've already told the prosecutor.

03:29.340 --> 03:31.089
Bring up the photo, please.

(Defendant)

(Live a Healthier Life)

04:48.420 --> 04:49.500
Hey, kiddo.

04:53.420 --> 04:55.759
Look at his face. What a hot mess.

05:03.430 --> 05:05.519
I see that you've become quite gutsy.

05:07.649 --> 05:09.268
Must I look up at you?

05:09.269 --> 05:10.610
Sit down, you little punk.

05:26.959 --> 05:28.790
Leave something that you care about...

05:29.540 --> 05:31.040
so I can save my face.

05:39.220 --> 05:40.599
What do you want?

05:40.600 --> 05:42.759
A hand or foot will do.

05:43.970 --> 05:45.810
Your head will be even better.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.160
You won't regret this, right?

06:16.300 --> 06:17.589
I'll kindly disinfect this first.

06:51.459 --> 06:52.709
What are you doing here?

06:55.089 --> 06:56.250
What do you think?

06:57.089 --> 06:58.379
Look what this punk did...

06:59.009 --> 07:01.300
to my boy, Doo Sik.

07:07.930 --> 07:09.980
You two fought fair and square, and you lost.

07:11.980 --> 07:13.980
What is this now? Aren't you embarrassed?

07:17.939 --> 07:19.069
Hey, Song Baek Ho.

07:24.699 --> 07:26.740
I get that you're a goon from who knows where,

07:32.790 --> 07:34.329
but you'd better not cross the line.

07:43.300 --> 07:44.930
Stay out of trouble.

07:48.100 --> 07:50.730
Lie low and don't even let me hear you breathe.

08:00.360 --> 08:02.779
This is ridiculous.

08:12.829 --> 08:13.920
Kiddo.

08:15.379 --> 08:16.459
Get lost.

08:24.550 --> 08:25.589
Let's go.

08:46.490 --> 08:47.700
Doo Sik.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.120
As they say, whoever tied the knot must untie it.

09:13.559 --> 09:14.679
From now on,

09:15.769 --> 09:17.190
you'll have to watch your back.

09:19.190 --> 09:20.230
Why?

09:21.480 --> 09:22.980
That's just what thugs do.

09:24.490 --> 09:25.950
They stab you in the back.

09:45.549 --> 09:48.389
Counsel, you may examine the witness now.

09:48.590 --> 09:49.639
Yes, Your Honour.

10:01.399 --> 10:02.610
Mr. Kim.

10:04.190 --> 10:06.398
Do you recognize the witness?

10:06.399 --> 10:08.240
(Defendant)

10:12.659 --> 10:13.700
What's the problem?

10:14.539 --> 10:15.659
Then be on your way.

10:16.580 --> 10:17.659
Yes.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.749
We ran into him in front of her house that night.

10:20.750 --> 10:22.500
Then by any chance,

10:22.919 --> 10:25.009
is there anything you know about him?

10:26.720 --> 10:27.758
No.

10:27.759 --> 10:28.840
Mr. Yoo.

10:29.679 --> 10:31.799
Why did you park in front of the victim's house that night?

10:32.350 --> 10:35.139
Your place is over 1km away from her house,

10:35.269 --> 10:36.309
and on top of that,

10:37.139 --> 10:40.269
you had plenty of parking space right in front of your house.

10:40.850 --> 10:42.229
(Witness)

10:42.230 --> 10:44.519
I parked there to rest for a moment.

10:45.610 --> 10:47.610
That's what I told the police.

10:52.700 --> 10:54.449
You said you saw Mr. Kim and the victim...

10:54.450 --> 10:56.789
at around 11pm that night.

10:57.159 --> 10:58.959
But as you can see,

10:58.960 --> 11:01.789
you didn't get home until about 12:20am,

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
so you had about an hour and 20 minutes.

11:05.210 --> 11:06.549
What did you do during that time?

11:06.799 --> 11:09.470
Nothing. I was just chilling in my car,

11:10.470 --> 11:11.720
listening to music...

11:12.049 --> 11:13.600
and playing some mobile games on my phone.

11:14.720 --> 11:16.259
Is that so?

11:17.269 --> 11:19.139
I see. But here is what's really strange.

11:20.230 --> 11:21.649
This was two days before the incident.

11:22.309 --> 11:24.610
Four days and even a week before her death,

11:25.519 --> 11:27.110
you were lurking around her house.

11:28.860 --> 11:30.240
Why were you there?

11:35.330 --> 11:37.450
(Judge)

11:40.210 --> 11:41.750
Okay. Let me ask you again.

11:42.419 --> 11:43.789
During that 1 hour and 20 minutes...

11:44.289 --> 11:46.460
on the day of her death,

11:46.919 --> 11:48.169
what were you doing?

11:58.350 --> 12:00.519
While stalking Ms. Hong,

12:01.350 --> 12:04.099
you happened to see her going home with a guy.

12:04.100 --> 12:05.559
Unable to control your anger,

12:07.610 --> 12:09.570
you ended up killing her...

12:09.990 --> 12:11.239
on the spur of the moment.

12:11.240 --> 12:12.360
Objection, Your Honour.

12:13.279 --> 12:16.869
Instead of focusing on proving Mr. Kim not guilty,

12:16.870 --> 12:19.039
Counsel is trying to confuse the members of the jury...

12:19.159 --> 12:21.579
by pinning the murder on the witness and making him look like a suspect.

12:21.580 --> 12:23.459
(Judge)

12:23.460 --> 12:27.840
I believe this argument is worth listening to.

12:29.129 --> 12:31.799
Counsel, you may continue.

12:37.720 --> 12:38.809
Mr. Yoo.

12:40.519 --> 12:41.850
I need you to answer my question.

12:46.309 --> 12:48.269
Darn it. This is so embarrassing.

12:51.360 --> 12:52.440
Look.

12:54.610 --> 12:55.990
To tell you the truth,

12:58.240 --> 13:00.539
I wasn't interested in Hong Guk Hwa at all.

13:02.450 --> 13:06.080
See that lady there? I liked Yoon Hyo Jung.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.039
Sorry?

13:13.759 --> 13:17.219
Besides, I was caught stalking her two weeks before that...

13:17.220 --> 13:18.888
and was interrogated by the police.

13:18.889 --> 13:22.179
As a result of it, I paid a fine.

13:24.139 --> 13:29.109
(Defendant)

13:29.110 --> 13:31.399
(Prosecution)

13:31.610 --> 13:34.899
(Exhibit 3: Yoo Seung Hoon)

13:52.129 --> 13:55.259
Mr. Yoo, have you been questioned by the police...

13:56.009 --> 13:58.389
as a suspect in this murder case?

13:59.220 --> 14:01.179
But I'm not a suspect.

14:01.559 --> 14:02.889
I'm a witness.

14:08.190 --> 14:09.350
Darn it.

14:36.720 --> 14:38.970
Let's see.

14:41.179 --> 14:42.679
Give me something.

14:44.600 --> 14:45.970
Darn.

15:19.129 --> 15:20.129
Go ahead.

15:21.509 --> 15:22.549
I'm good.

16:28.909 --> 16:30.750
If there are no more arguments to be made,

16:31.250 --> 16:32.250
the prosecution will give a closing argument...

16:32.250 --> 16:33.250
and request a sentence.

16:34.120 --> 16:36.250
Counsel will also give a closing argument...

16:36.879 --> 16:39.668
and the jury will decide on a verdict.

16:39.669 --> 16:40.879
(Defendant)

16:41.299 --> 16:44.379
Does the prosecution have any objections?

16:44.840 --> 16:45.840
I do not, Your Honour.

16:47.299 --> 16:48.308
Counsel?

16:48.309 --> 16:51.179
(Defence)

16:53.889 --> 16:55.899
I would like to summon a witness within precinct of court.

16:56.480 --> 16:58.059
A witness within precinct of court.

16:58.730 --> 17:00.649
Then he or she must be in the courtroom.

17:01.570 --> 17:02.570
That's right.

17:03.899 --> 17:08.409
Chief Park, how many years have you been a detective?

17:08.410 --> 17:09.828
(Witness)

17:09.829 --> 17:12.500
I've been in the Violent Crimes Unit for about 30 years.

17:13.960 --> 17:16.880
The only suspect you looked into for this case...

17:18.250 --> 17:19.589
was the defendant, right?

17:19.960 --> 17:21.799
I see your intention.

17:22.670 --> 17:23.670
Could you please...

17:24.799 --> 17:26.220
answer my question?

17:27.089 --> 17:28.089
That's right.

17:28.890 --> 17:31.309
All the evidence pointed to the defendant.

17:38.559 --> 17:40.150
The victim's roommate Yoon Hyo Jung.

17:40.609 --> 17:42.939
A week before the incident, she left...

17:42.940 --> 17:45.609
after arguing with the victim about her boyfriend.

17:46.069 --> 17:48.028
Um Ki Jong provided drugs to the victim.

17:48.029 --> 17:49.529
But neither of them were questioned.

17:49.740 --> 17:51.239
The victim's stepfather Cho Kang Pil...

17:51.240 --> 17:52.700
claimed a life insurance policy of 700,000 dollars...

17:53.329 --> 17:56.789
and also received an inheritance of five million dollars.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
Meanwhile, delivery man Lee Chul Ho had similar priors,

17:59.329 --> 18:01.709
knew the victim's residence, and had received...

18:01.710 --> 18:03.130
a claim regarding a parcel.

18:03.670 --> 18:05.508
He ran into them at the gas station...

18:05.509 --> 18:07.629
and followed them to the Han River.

18:07.630 --> 18:08.970
However, neither was investigated.

18:09.390 --> 18:12.889
The same goes for Yoo Seung Hoon who stalked the victim's roommate.

18:12.890 --> 18:14.180
Why not?

18:17.480 --> 18:19.479
With heinous crimes such as this one...

18:19.480 --> 18:21.519
where the victim was stabbed 13 times,

18:22.230 --> 18:23.730
the investigation begins with those she knew...

18:24.069 --> 18:26.400
or who had a personal grudge against her.

18:27.950 --> 18:29.200
Is that not common sense?

18:35.200 --> 18:36.250
A detective...

18:37.289 --> 18:39.539
investigates his case by following the evidence.

18:40.460 --> 18:42.539
And all the evidence in this murder case...

18:43.920 --> 18:46.009
points to the defendant, Kim Hyun Soo.

18:47.130 --> 18:48.130
Evidence.

18:49.589 --> 18:51.759
All you do is focus on the evidence.

18:52.349 --> 18:53.349
Can you...

18:54.849 --> 18:56.019
tell me what this is?

18:56.519 --> 18:57.769
It's the evidence log.

18:59.349 --> 19:01.480
Normally, the evidence found at the scene...

19:01.900 --> 19:04.359
should match the evidence listed on this sheet.

19:04.859 --> 19:05.859
That's right.

19:09.609 --> 19:12.529
That is the defendant's nebulizer. His asthma inhaler.

19:13.490 --> 19:14.779
Do you recognize it?

19:16.369 --> 19:18.788
- I do. - But it's weird though.

19:18.789 --> 19:20.328
(Exhibit 9: Defendant's Inhaler)

19:20.329 --> 19:23.670
There's a photo of an inhaler that was spotted on the scene,

19:24.789 --> 19:26.299
but here...

19:27.130 --> 19:28.588
(Evidence Log)

19:28.589 --> 19:32.759
I'm curious as to why it is not on this list of evidence.

19:34.140 --> 19:35.140
Why?

19:37.349 --> 19:38.729
(Exhibit 9: Defendant's Inhaler)

19:38.730 --> 19:39.730
Mr. Kim,

19:40.769 --> 19:42.650
where did you get your inhaler that night?

19:56.329 --> 19:57.579
While I was in lockup,

19:58.750 --> 20:00.329
he gave it to me.

20:06.960 --> 20:08.960
Chief Park, is this true?

20:11.380 --> 20:12.380
Yes.

20:13.799 --> 20:15.429
You gave him back...

20:15.430 --> 20:19.180
the only evidence found at the scene that belonged to the defendant.

20:20.230 --> 20:22.849
I honestly don't get why, so enlighten me.

20:25.609 --> 20:27.818
It seemed like he was having a hard time.

20:27.819 --> 20:30.278
If you were that worried, you should've gotten him medicine...

20:30.279 --> 20:31.900
or sent him to a hospital.

20:32.779 --> 20:35.200
A detective in violent crimes with 30 years under his belt.

20:35.740 --> 20:38.200
You say you conduct investigations solely based on the evidence,

20:38.910 --> 20:40.578
but not only did you remove...

20:40.579 --> 20:42.210
this key piece of evidence from the scene,

20:42.539 --> 20:45.169
but you also returned it to your one and only suspect.

20:45.170 --> 20:46.539
How does that make sense?

20:50.420 --> 20:52.258
I concluded that his inhaler...

20:52.259 --> 20:55.049
was not a key piece of evidence in this case.

20:55.549 --> 20:56.549
Also,

20:57.680 --> 21:00.179
the police is bound by the law to protect suspects' rights...

21:00.180 --> 21:01.180
That wasn't it.

21:03.190 --> 21:04.190
It wasn't.

21:08.109 --> 21:10.029
My client...

21:10.690 --> 21:12.779
is an innocent-looking young man in his 20s.

21:13.990 --> 21:16.319
A college student with no priors who struggles with asthma.

21:16.819 --> 21:19.868
In the eyes of a veteran detective with 30 years of experience,

21:19.869 --> 21:22.538
he did not fit the profile of a rape and murder suspect.

21:22.539 --> 21:24.460
You removed this inhaler...

21:24.960 --> 21:27.500
since it did not fit the picture you drew.

21:30.960 --> 21:32.960
This is an illegal misconduct...

21:33.759 --> 21:36.049
which deems this evidence inadmissible.

21:36.509 --> 21:38.719
Chief Park, the lead detective on the case,

21:38.720 --> 21:42.519
targeted my client as a suspect before investigating the evidence.

21:42.809 --> 21:44.979
Any evidence that goes against his theory...

21:44.980 --> 21:46.268
were ignored and disregarded.

21:46.269 --> 21:48.269
The case was designed to target only my client.

21:49.690 --> 21:51.190
It might not be a singular incident.

21:51.819 --> 21:53.778
There may well be other evidence...

21:53.779 --> 21:55.779
that were disregarded just like this inhaler.

21:57.160 --> 21:59.450
As a member of the judicial community,

21:59.990 --> 22:03.409
I am deeply worried about this type of habitual misconduct.

22:03.410 --> 22:05.210
Since the prosecution...

22:05.710 --> 22:08.419
moved to indict my client based on this evidence,

22:08.420 --> 22:10.088
I must now doubt...

22:10.089 --> 22:11.798
whether or not they also followed proper procedure.

22:11.799 --> 22:12.880
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

22:14.299 --> 22:16.220
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

22:18.009 --> 22:19.549
Is there a reason...

22:21.099 --> 22:23.769
for this trial to even continue?

22:31.519 --> 22:32.519
That'll be all.

22:35.069 --> 22:36.739
(Judge)

22:36.740 --> 22:37.740
Now,

22:39.069 --> 22:41.700
the prosecutor will give her final statement.

22:59.470 --> 23:01.009
The police investigation...

23:02.259 --> 23:03.390
was indeed insufficient.

23:05.019 --> 23:07.480
I also admit that there were more suspects...

23:08.099 --> 23:09.099
besides the defendant.

23:10.559 --> 23:12.940
However, that does not mean...

23:13.519 --> 23:16.690
we should overlook the facts of this case that were presented.

23:21.029 --> 23:24.279
The fact that the victim was brutally murdered.

23:25.660 --> 23:26.910
The fact that the defendant...

23:27.119 --> 23:30.170
was at the scene when she died.

23:31.579 --> 23:33.078
The fact that...

23:33.079 --> 23:36.630
there is no evidence to suggest a third person at the house.

23:37.630 --> 23:41.640
The fact that he was covered in her blood.

23:42.589 --> 23:44.099
He did not call for help,

23:44.640 --> 23:46.930
but decided to destroy evidence.

23:47.470 --> 23:49.390
And most importantly,

23:49.940 --> 23:52.940
after fleeing the scene,

23:53.150 --> 23:56.359
a knife with her blood on it was found on his person.

23:59.359 --> 24:01.910
It does not get any clearer than this.

24:10.039 --> 24:11.079
So the prosecution...

24:11.789 --> 24:15.130
will take the heinous nature of this crime into account...

24:16.170 --> 24:17.669
and show no mercy to the defendant...

24:17.670 --> 24:19.170
who claims his innocence and pretends not to remember.

24:21.680 --> 24:22.930
We hereby request...

24:25.640 --> 24:27.470
the death penalty.

24:28.140 --> 24:31.268
(Defence)

24:31.269 --> 24:35.359
(Judge)

25:13.980 --> 25:14.980
Darn it.

25:36.630 --> 25:38.170
Your ruling comes out tomorrow, right?

25:40.210 --> 25:41.210
Yes.

25:43.670 --> 25:45.430
This isn't the place for you.

25:54.059 --> 25:55.390
I hope I never see you again.

26:33.470 --> 26:36.309
The detective in charge of... No.

26:36.480 --> 26:40.189
Chief Park Sang Bum, who spearheaded this investigation...

26:40.190 --> 26:42.568
Um Ki Jong, Yoon Hyo Jung, Lee Chul Ho.

26:42.569 --> 26:44.899
Even though there were a number of suspects...

26:44.900 --> 26:46.699
Based on circumstantial evidence and speculations...

26:46.700 --> 26:48.779
No, this won't do.

26:51.319 --> 26:53.659
The Constitution of the Republic of Korea...

26:53.660 --> 26:55.950
states that everyone is innocent until proven guilty.

26:56.200 --> 26:57.578
Without conclusive evidence...

26:57.579 --> 26:59.999
Without irrefutable, definite evidence...

27:00.000 --> 27:02.670
The prosecution must present irrefutable... Gosh.

27:05.549 --> 27:07.920
Darn it.

27:46.960 --> 27:49.420
Gosh, seriously...

27:50.720 --> 27:51.839
Darn it.

28:33.220 --> 28:34.549
Gosh.

28:38.640 --> 28:39.980
Goodness.

28:46.269 --> 28:47.519
My gosh.

28:57.779 --> 29:00.200
Darn it.

29:13.630 --> 29:18.430
(Supreme Court of Korea)

29:27.519 --> 29:30.940
(Jury)

29:33.069 --> 29:34.450
I look a mess today.

29:37.160 --> 29:39.119
I thought long and hard whether it'd be okay for me...

29:39.660 --> 29:41.289
to be here today, looking like this.

29:44.329 --> 29:47.380
According to my doctor, this is triggered by extreme stress.

29:49.420 --> 29:50.750
And it's true.

29:55.009 --> 29:58.089
I've never worked on such a big case before.

30:03.680 --> 30:05.390
You see, I am an attorney.

30:07.269 --> 30:09.519
However, I do not belong here.

30:11.400 --> 30:13.319
I'm a so-called third-rate lawyer...

30:16.740 --> 30:18.700
who specializes in petty cases.

30:19.450 --> 30:21.160
I handle...

30:22.119 --> 30:24.579
over 365 cases in a year.

30:27.039 --> 30:28.960
Over the course of my 20-year career as a lawyer,

30:31.750 --> 30:35.299
I have dealt with thousands of criminals.

30:36.170 --> 30:37.380
So I have...

30:38.549 --> 30:40.009
gotten to a point where I can just tell...

30:41.599 --> 30:44.179
whether someone's guilty the moment I see them.

30:44.180 --> 30:46.689
(Defendant)

30:46.690 --> 30:47.769
So what did I think...

30:50.019 --> 30:51.400
the moment...

30:53.150 --> 30:56.900
I first met Mr. Kim, who is sitting over there?

30:58.990 --> 31:00.990
I took one look at him and could instinctively tell...

31:02.990 --> 31:05.789
that he was innocent.

31:07.789 --> 31:09.079
The kind eyes.

31:10.130 --> 31:12.039
And the humble, polite demeanour.

31:12.539 --> 31:13.799
A college student in his 20s,

31:14.130 --> 31:15.880
who was busy studying, dating,

31:16.630 --> 31:19.720
and looking for a job. Just an ordinary college student.

31:20.220 --> 31:21.799
And an ordinary young man.

31:22.259 --> 31:23.680
And this young man...

31:25.470 --> 31:27.180
has been insisting that he is innocent...

31:28.190 --> 31:29.980
since day one.

31:30.849 --> 31:31.859
Of course,

31:33.730 --> 31:37.400
I wouldn't say he is completely innocent.

31:38.450 --> 31:41.068
He drove his father's taxi without permission...

31:41.069 --> 31:42.660
to go meet up with his friends.

31:42.869 --> 31:45.700
He took drugs given to him by a woman he had never met before.

31:46.329 --> 31:48.868
And upon finding the victim dead, he fled the scene...

31:48.869 --> 31:50.210
without even calling an ambulance.

31:50.539 --> 31:53.130
Flustered, he even tampered with the evidence at scene,

31:53.880 --> 31:56.509
then drove before the alcohol and drugs...

31:57.960 --> 31:59.130
wore off.

32:01.180 --> 32:04.180
These are the offences that Mr. Kim committed.

32:05.680 --> 32:07.890
He did not do anything else.

32:09.269 --> 32:12.650
And there is no evidence that he killed the victim, Ms. Hong.

32:14.940 --> 32:16.819
The evidence that the prosecution has presented so far...

32:17.650 --> 32:19.650
is all circumstantial and based on speculations.

32:20.650 --> 32:22.950
The police detective who spearheaded the investigation...

32:23.660 --> 32:25.699
removed a piece of evidence from the crime scene.

32:25.700 --> 32:28.038
He did not question other suspects at all because he had Mr. Kim...

32:28.039 --> 32:30.960
pinned down as the prime suspect from the get-go.

32:32.079 --> 32:33.250
So as a result,

32:35.339 --> 32:37.299
Mr. Kim fell victim to the police's targeted investigation...

32:38.339 --> 32:40.880
conducted with a clear goal in mind.

32:43.009 --> 32:44.470
He has lost his freedom,

32:44.970 --> 32:46.509
and no one trusts him anymore.

32:47.349 --> 32:49.599
Along with that, he has also lost hope.

32:52.019 --> 32:54.230
However, there is one thing he hasn't lost and can still claim.

32:55.480 --> 32:59.069
Be it a suspect, perpetrator, or a defendant.

33:00.240 --> 33:03.410
No one should be presumed guilty...

33:04.529 --> 33:06.779
until there is proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

33:08.369 --> 33:09.410
That's right.

33:11.119 --> 33:13.369
As stated in the Constitution of the Republic of Korea,

33:14.579 --> 33:16.630
everyone shall be presumed innocent until proven guilty.

33:18.500 --> 33:20.380
Unless the prosecution can present...

33:21.460 --> 33:22.919
irrefutable, conclusive evidence...

33:22.920 --> 33:25.640
in this courtroom that Mr. Kim indeed committed the murder,

33:26.799 --> 33:28.509
he should be found...

33:31.849 --> 33:33.559
not guilty.

33:35.849 --> 33:38.230
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

33:40.440 --> 33:42.900
That young man's future...

33:44.450 --> 33:45.779
depends...

33:49.619 --> 33:51.119
on your decision.

33:59.710 --> 34:00.880
I rest my case.

34:22.320 --> 34:24.739
The jury will now have a discussion.

34:25.070 --> 34:27.489
The court will announce the verdict once a decision is reached.

34:43.550 --> 34:47.340
(Please keep quiet.)

35:24.710 --> 35:27.840
(Jury)

35:41.480 --> 35:43.940
The jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict.

35:45.820 --> 35:47.610
In a jury trial,

35:47.989 --> 35:50.280
a majority verdict is permitted...

35:50.860 --> 35:54.119
when an unanimous verdict cannot be reached.

35:54.369 --> 35:56.078
(Judge)

35:56.079 --> 35:58.710
Four voted for guilty, and five voted for not guilty.

36:03.840 --> 36:05.630
Hence, based on this,

36:06.250 --> 36:07.760
the jury decided on a not guilty verdict.

36:08.920 --> 36:11.889
However, the jury's decision...

36:12.510 --> 36:14.639
is only taken into consideration.

36:15.469 --> 36:18.730
The court decides whether or not the accused is guilty.

36:22.059 --> 36:23.099
Mr. Kim.

36:25.110 --> 36:27.780
If there is anything you'd like to say, please go ahead.

36:36.280 --> 36:40.159
(Supreme Court of Korea)

36:56.929 --> 36:58.179
Do you still believe...

37:01.690 --> 37:03.400
that I killed her?

37:07.650 --> 37:08.730
Because...

37:12.530 --> 37:14.110
I was with Guk Hwa that night?

37:19.489 --> 37:20.829
When I think about Guk Hwa,

37:22.710 --> 37:24.369
I do feel terrible.

37:29.960 --> 37:31.090
But...

37:36.300 --> 37:37.719
am I the killer?

37:47.940 --> 37:49.519
I'm not sure.

38:02.369 --> 38:05.250
Then I will now announce the court's decision.

38:08.539 --> 38:09.750
The court...

38:10.550 --> 38:13.260
has carefully reviewed the counsel's arguments...

38:13.670 --> 38:15.179
regarding the lack of definite evidence,

38:15.800 --> 38:17.549
the police's inadequate investigation,

38:17.550 --> 38:19.349
and the evidence that could be deemed inadmissible.

38:20.349 --> 38:22.809
However, the court has concluded that the investigation...

38:22.849 --> 38:25.599
and the indictment were sufficient and reasonable...

38:26.480 --> 38:28.480
and that Mr. Kim is objectively guilty...

38:28.650 --> 38:31.269
of the charges brought against him.

38:32.280 --> 38:33.610
Ergo,

38:34.030 --> 38:36.819
the court has concluded that Mr. Kim is guilty...

38:36.820 --> 38:38.659
of most of the charges brought against him...

38:39.409 --> 38:41.030
and that Mr. Kim is guilty...

38:41.579 --> 38:44.829
of Ms. Hong Guk Hwa's murder.

38:45.960 --> 38:47.999
Since he still insists that he does not remember anything...

38:48.000 --> 38:50.420
and is showing no remorse,

38:51.630 --> 38:52.840
the court hereby sentences him...

38:56.550 --> 38:58.550
to life imprisonment.

so don't you worry.

42:07.030 --> 42:09.869

42:12.699 --> 42:13.869
an appeal...

42:14.869 --> 42:16.369
could work.
