00:05.835 --> 00:06.768
Mm.

00:06.873 --> 00:08.470
No sign of it letting up.

00:08.505 --> 00:10.072
Hayley: Just gonna have to be late.

00:10.107 --> 00:12.172
Frankly,
I'm in no rush to leave this party...

00:12.208 --> 00:13.908
Thanks to your father's excellent taste

00:13.943 --> 00:14.775
in Scotch and daughters.

00:14.811 --> 00:16.844
- Oh, the man knows his stuff.
- Mm.

Ohhh. Blackout. Come on.

00:42.337 --> 00:44.437
[Sighs] Must be from the storm.

00:44.472 --> 00:45.605
Hold on. I know my dad keeps

00:45.640 --> 00:48.107
a flashlight here somewhere.

00:50.511 --> 00:52.745
[Thunder crashes, glass shatters]

00:52.780 --> 00:53.812
Did you hear that?

00:53.848 --> 00:55.213
Is someone trying to break in?

01:00.788 --> 01:02.154
[Both gasp]

[Groans]

[Thunder crashes]

01:19.272 --> 01:23.140
So, the power is out,
the phones are down.

01:23.175 --> 01:24.074
You know what that means?

01:24.109 --> 01:25.676
No late-night calls from work

01:25.711 --> 01:27.644
to interrupt our game of naked Twister.

01:27.680 --> 01:28.812
What, why are you still dressed?

01:28.847 --> 01:30.080
I've got to go to the precinct.

01:30.115 --> 01:31.514
What? Now?!

01:31.550 --> 01:34.184
T-There's nothing more
romantic than a blackout.

01:34.219 --> 01:35.385
Yeah, and nothing more deadly.

01:35.420 --> 01:37.953
You know as well as I do that
as soon as the lights go out,

01:37.989 --> 01:39.188
bad things happen.

01:39.223 --> 01:40.956
[Alarm blaring]

01:40.992 --> 01:42.124
What the hell's that?

01:42.160 --> 01:43.959
The panic signal from the P.I. office.

01:43.995 --> 01:46.662
I had it set up for when
Alexis is there by herself.

01:46.698 --> 01:48.064
No service.

01:49.300 --> 01:51.300
This is Captain Beckett to Central.

01:51.335 --> 01:53.102
Alexis?

01:53.137 --> 01:54.468
What happened? Are you all right?

01:54.504 --> 01:56.871
Yeah. That guy broke in with an ax,

01:56.907 --> 01:58.173
yelling something in Latin.

01:58.208 --> 02:00.108
Then he just dropped dead.

02:00.143 --> 02:01.943
What did he say?

02:01.978 --> 02:02.844
I don't know. It all happened so fast.

02:02.879 --> 02:05.180
Beckett: Is that what he broke in with?

02:05.215 --> 02:07.115
Yep. Talk about crashing a party.

02:07.150 --> 02:09.317
Turns out it's the fire ax
from the downstairs lobby.

02:09.352 --> 02:11.451
So our intruder must've
grabbed it on his way up.

02:11.486 --> 02:14.021
But why? I mean, there's easier ways

02:14.056 --> 02:15.322
to break into this office.

02:15.357 --> 02:16.456
Yeah, and more silent.

02:16.491 --> 02:18.959
He certainly wasn't planning
on sneaking up on anyone.

02:18.994 --> 02:20.027
You get an ID on the guy?

02:20.062 --> 02:22.196
No. No wallet, and your, uh,

02:22.231 --> 02:24.164
portable fingerprint
thingumajiggy is down

02:24.200 --> 02:25.265
due to weather.

02:25.300 --> 02:27.400
Lanie: He bled to death from
a wound in his left side.

02:27.436 --> 02:29.368
My guess is whatever he was stabbed with

02:29.403 --> 02:31.637
punctured his subclavian artery.

02:31.672 --> 02:33.740
After that,
he would've had about 30 minutes

02:33.775 --> 02:35.208
to an hour, tops.

02:35.243 --> 02:38.878
Well, he came in here
with this around 9:00 p.m.

02:38.913 --> 02:40.379
He keeled over shortly thereafter.

02:40.414 --> 02:43.682
So he must've been stabbed
between 8:00 and 8:30.

02:43.718 --> 02:46.818
There's a...
There's a hospital bracelet.

02:46.854 --> 02:49.855
Our intruder's name is G. Shaw,

02:49.890 --> 02:52.224
and he was a patient at...

02:52.259 --> 02:55.326
Peakmore Psychiatric Facility.

02:55.362 --> 02:56.928
Yikes.

02:56.964 --> 02:58.096
You know it?

02:58.132 --> 03:00.732
It's a psychiatric hospital
for the criminally insane.

03:00.768 --> 03:05.069
Our ax-wielding psycho is
an escaped mental patient.

03:08.307 --> 03:10.440
Back-up generator's not working so well.

03:10.476 --> 03:12.276
Yeah, place like this you'd
think would be state of the art.

03:12.311 --> 03:13.244
We're here about an escaped inmate

03:13.279 --> 03:15.846
just tried to kill
two people with an ax.

03:15.882 --> 03:18.515
Um... wait here.

03:18.550 --> 03:20.850
[Man yelling in distance]

03:20.886 --> 03:24.720
Yo, I'd try to escape,
too, if I lived here.

03:24.756 --> 03:26.956
Who knows what they're
doing to them back there.

03:26.992 --> 03:29.225
Can't be anything worse than
what we did historically.

03:29.261 --> 03:32.295
Many cultures mistook mental
illness for a sign of sorcery.

03:32.330 --> 03:34.697
Treatments ranged from, well, prayer

03:34.732 --> 03:36.899
to drilling holes in the
skull to release the demons.

03:36.934 --> 03:38.233
Definitely a case of the cure

03:38.269 --> 03:39.301
being worse than the disease.

03:39.336 --> 03:40.969
The Director's coming out now.

03:41.005 --> 03:42.905
Thanks, man.

03:42.940 --> 03:45.107
Detectives, I'm Dr. Brock Martin.

03:45.142 --> 03:46.775
Did you find Gabriel Shaw?

03:46.811 --> 03:49.912
No, he found us,
but not before he was fatally stabbed.

03:49.947 --> 03:51.880
That's terrible.

03:51.916 --> 03:55.149
Gabriel Shaw's been here at
Peakmore for the last 20 years.

03:55.185 --> 03:56.250
What did he do?

03:56.286 --> 03:58.552
He broke into the house of
a man named Warren Crowne,

03:58.587 --> 04:00.822
tried to kill him and his entire family.

04:00.857 --> 04:02.290
Warren Crowne the philanthropist?

04:02.325 --> 04:03.524
I remember the headlines.

04:03.559 --> 04:06.227
Didn't his attacker say he was
some kind of avenging angel?

04:06.262 --> 04:07.795
The archangel Gabriel...
The divine messenger.

04:07.831 --> 04:09.330
Catechism class.

04:09.365 --> 04:10.964
Gabriel Shaw was convinced

04:10.999 --> 04:13.066
that he was on a mission from God

04:13.101 --> 04:14.267
to rid the world of evil.

04:14.303 --> 04:18.137
It was a mission that even 20
years of antipsychotic drugs

04:18.173 --> 04:21.107
and electroshock therapy
could not dissuade him from.

04:21.142 --> 04:22.809
Any idea who might've wanted him dead?

04:22.845 --> 04:24.010
None.

04:24.046 --> 04:27.179
Gabriel's contact with the
outside world was virtually nil.

04:27.215 --> 04:29.315
His room's down here.

04:29.350 --> 04:31.951
Any idea how he might've escaped?

04:31.986 --> 04:35.154
Yes, he, uh, he stole a keycard
from one of our orderlies.

04:35.189 --> 04:39.191
Uh, we realized he was
missing around noon today.

04:39.227 --> 04:42.328
Noon? Why the hell didn't
you call the police before?

04:42.363 --> 04:43.795
We should have. I realize that now.

04:43.831 --> 04:46.030
The man came to my
office wielding an ax.

04:46.066 --> 04:46.965
Which is why I sent out

04:47.000 --> 04:49.167
a group of orderlies
looking for Gabriel.

04:49.202 --> 04:53.371
They searched all day and
came back empty-handed.

04:53.406 --> 04:55.439
- Except...
- Except what?

04:55.475 --> 04:58.276
One of the orderlies
hasn't come back yet.

04:58.311 --> 04:59.777
Uh, Dave Holmby.

04:59.812 --> 05:03.180
I-I-I tried calling him,
but the phones are out.

05:03.215 --> 05:05.548
Have Dave and Gabriel had
any problems in the past?

05:05.584 --> 05:09.519
They've had... issues, yes.

05:09.554 --> 05:13.048
In fact, it was Dave's
keycard that Gabriel stole.

05:13.826 --> 05:16.126
But Dave's been with us a long time.

05:16.162 --> 05:18.161
He's not the type of
person to kill anyone,

05:18.196 --> 05:19.495
if that's what you're thinking.

05:19.530 --> 05:21.297
You sent an orderly out to recapture

05:21.332 --> 05:23.666
a violent, mentally unstable man.

05:23.702 --> 05:25.534
It's possible he was
trying to subdue Gabriel

05:25.570 --> 05:27.036
and things got out of control.

05:27.072 --> 05:29.839
So, Dave stabs Gabriel,
but then loses him in the storm.

05:29.874 --> 05:31.908
[Rattling in distance]
Guys, are you hearing that?

05:35.245 --> 05:37.079
[Creaking]

05:41.251 --> 05:43.085
Something in here.

05:52.561 --> 05:54.028
[Clattering]

05:54.063 --> 05:55.329
[All shout]

05:58.367 --> 06:00.234
Might've told me about
your rodent problem.

06:00.269 --> 06:02.036
We don't have one.

06:02.071 --> 06:03.738
Not usually.

06:03.773 --> 06:06.073
Must've been driven to
higher ground by the storm.

06:06.109 --> 06:07.808
That a bible?

06:07.844 --> 06:12.678
Yeah, but with... drawings...

06:12.714 --> 06:14.981
of demons, page after page of them.

06:15.016 --> 06:18.084
[Walkie-talkie beeps]
Lanie: Ryan, Javi, anyone there?

06:18.120 --> 06:19.418
Yeah, Lanie. We're here. Go ahead.

06:19.454 --> 06:21.221
Well, get your ass to the morgue.

06:21.256 --> 06:23.389
I found something disturbing.

06:23.424 --> 06:25.125
Yeah, well,
that seems to be going around.

06:31.298 --> 06:32.898
So, what is so...

06:35.369 --> 06:37.102
Whoa.

06:37.138 --> 06:38.003
Is that blood?

06:38.038 --> 06:40.205
[Sighs] Well, not according to Lanie.

06:40.241 --> 06:42.840
Then... what is it?

06:42.876 --> 06:44.776
Some kind of ink.

06:44.811 --> 06:46.443
Lanie sent samples to the lab,

06:46.479 --> 06:48.712
but one thing that we do know is,
based on the writing,

06:48.748 --> 06:50.547
there's no way that Gabriel
did this to himself.

06:50.583 --> 06:52.250
So, then, someone at the hospital.

06:52.285 --> 06:53.751
Yeah, I called, and they said

06:53.787 --> 06:55.186
that he didn't have any writing on him

06:55.221 --> 06:56.353
when he escaped this morning.

06:56.389 --> 06:58.355
The Roman numerals are bible verses,

06:58.391 --> 06:59.456
and the words are all in Latin.

06:59.492 --> 07:05.128
"Protect me, O Lord,
from the hands of the wicked."

07:05.164 --> 07:06.763
It's a prayer for salvation.

07:06.799 --> 07:08.631
Sounds like he was scared, but of what?

07:08.667 --> 07:10.901
The mysteries don't stop there.

07:10.936 --> 07:13.536
When I conducted the autopsy,
I found that the wound

07:13.571 --> 07:16.773
had been inflicted by some
kind of talon or claw.

07:16.808 --> 07:18.307
Like an animal?

07:18.342 --> 07:19.741
It gets even weirder.

07:19.777 --> 07:22.544
There was a strange
substance inside the wound.

07:22.579 --> 07:25.480
Let me guess... sulfur.

07:25.516 --> 07:27.216
Yeah, how'd you know?

07:27.251 --> 07:30.219
Guys, isn't it obvious?

07:30.254 --> 07:33.922
Latin prayers, a claw, sulfur...
Also known...

07:33.957 --> 07:35.456
as brimstone?

07:35.491 --> 07:36.757
[Scoffs] Come on, Castle.

07:36.793 --> 07:38.159
Castle, you don't think that...

07:38.195 --> 07:39.527
Oh, but I do.

07:41.198 --> 07:43.932
We all have our demons.

07:43.967 --> 07:46.067
But Gabriel was killed by his.

sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

07:53.501 --> 07:54.666
What did I tell you?

07:54.702 --> 07:57.103
I mean, as soon as the lights go out,
bad things happen.

07:57.203 --> 07:59.436
You know, at least the precinct
is on a backup generator,

07:59.471 --> 08:00.571
'cause the rest of the city

08:00.606 --> 08:02.206
is gonna have intermittent power.

08:02.241 --> 08:03.373
Today's gonna be hell.

08:03.409 --> 08:04.440
Well, that's appropriate,

08:04.475 --> 08:06.776
since that's the likely
place our killer is from.

08:07.012 --> 08:09.512
You know, do you think we're
gonna need specialized equipment

08:09.547 --> 08:12.481
to capture this demon murderer,
something exorcism-esque?

08:12.517 --> 08:15.084
There's nothing supernatural
about this case.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.921
Our victim was stabbed with
a brimstone-covered claw,

08:17.956 --> 08:19.655
or gored by a horn, perhaps.

08:19.690 --> 08:20.989
Now, what but a demon could do that?

08:21.025 --> 08:24.592
Look, Ryan and Espo are bringing
in Dave Holmby, our rogue orderly,

08:24.628 --> 08:26.661
and I am sure that they are going to get

08:26.696 --> 08:28.530
a very sane and grounded explanation

08:28.565 --> 08:30.632
as to why he killed Gabriel Shaw.

08:30.667 --> 08:33.302
Seek the truth and thou
shalt be enlightened.

08:33.337 --> 08:35.304
Is that scripture?

08:35.339 --> 08:36.604
From the book of Castle.

08:38.073 --> 08:39.673
Hot damn, that was some storm!

08:39.707 --> 08:42.376
Seriously,
fit for neither man nor beast.

08:42.412 --> 08:45.313
I can only imagine how hard it was

08:45.348 --> 08:47.614
to track down an escaped mental
patient in the middle of it.

08:47.650 --> 08:49.450
Yeah, that was some Sherlock-level

08:49.485 --> 08:50.484
detective work, Dave.

08:50.519 --> 08:53.487
NYPD would be lucky to
have someone like you.

08:53.522 --> 08:54.830
- You know what we should do?
- Hmm?

08:54.909 --> 08:57.457
- Give him an application.
- Ooh, that's a good idea.

08:57.492 --> 08:58.291
Oh.

08:58.327 --> 09:00.393
Ahh, there's that whole murder issue.

09:00.429 --> 09:02.395
[Inhales sharply] Right.

09:02.431 --> 09:04.730
If only you wouldn't have
killed Shaw last night

09:04.766 --> 09:06.333
after you caught him.

09:06.368 --> 09:08.634
Not that I don't sympathize.
I mean, he stole your keycard.

09:08.670 --> 09:10.670
- Yep.
- You probably were gonna get fired.

09:10.705 --> 09:12.537
Wait a minute.
When I left Shaw, he was still alive.

09:12.573 --> 09:15.507
Oh, so you admit to seeing
him after he escaped?

09:15.542 --> 09:17.242
Yeah.

09:17.278 --> 09:19.845
Look, he used to talk about
this church on 87th street.

09:19.880 --> 09:22.547
So I went up there.
There he was, walking out.

09:22.583 --> 09:24.749
I grabbed him,
I tried to drag him into my car, but...

09:24.785 --> 09:26.185
But what?

09:26.220 --> 09:28.887
[Sighs] He knew that I was...

09:28.922 --> 09:30.588
liberating meds from patients

09:30.623 --> 09:31.822
and selling them on the street.

09:31.858 --> 09:33.891
Let me guess.

09:33.926 --> 09:35.926
He told you that if you took him back,

09:35.962 --> 09:37.761
he was gonna rat you out.

09:37.797 --> 09:39.763
I wish he said that.

09:39.799 --> 09:41.532
He promised he was gonna
out me no matter what.

09:41.567 --> 09:42.400
[Laughs] Wait a minute, that sounds like

09:42.435 --> 09:44.168
even more of a motive to stab the guy.

09:44.204 --> 09:45.936
I swear, I let him go.

09:45.972 --> 09:47.704
He was alive at 4:30 yesterday,

09:47.739 --> 09:49.272
and that was the last
time that I saw him.

09:49.308 --> 09:50.407
So, why didn't you go back to Peakmore?

09:50.442 --> 09:52.542
Why were you hiding out at
your girlfriend's apartment?

09:52.577 --> 09:53.676
I wasn't hiding.

09:53.712 --> 09:54.744
I figured Shaw was gonna
get caught sooner or later,

09:54.779 --> 09:57.614
which meant that I was out
of a job no matter what.

09:57.649 --> 09:58.648
So I said screw it.

09:58.683 --> 10:00.583
Might as well take the
rest of the night off and,

10:00.619 --> 10:02.752
you know, spend some time with my girl.

10:02.787 --> 10:04.786
All right,
let's pretend that that's true.

10:04.822 --> 10:07.523
Why now? After 20 years of confinement,

10:07.558 --> 10:09.625
why would Shaw decide to break out?

10:09.660 --> 10:11.627
All I know is in the past few weeks,

10:11.662 --> 10:12.728
he was really amped up.

10:12.763 --> 10:13.595
Why? Something happen to him?

10:13.631 --> 10:15.731
Not something, someone... A visitor.

10:15.766 --> 10:16.765
Esposito: Who?

10:16.800 --> 10:18.401
I don't know.

10:18.436 --> 10:21.436
But whoever it was really set Shaw off.

10:21.471 --> 10:22.437
I mean, he was already disturbed,

10:22.472 --> 10:25.606
but after this guy came by,
he got even worse.

10:28.645 --> 10:30.078
So, I pulled the police
file and court records

10:30.113 --> 10:31.279
for Shaw's prosecution 20 years ago,

10:31.314 --> 10:34.049
and according to this,
Shaw's attack on the Crowne family

10:34.084 --> 10:35.750
was anything but random.

10:35.785 --> 10:36.751
He was working as a consultant

10:36.786 --> 10:38.718
for a P.I. named Noah Kramer.

10:38.754 --> 10:39.953
What kind of consultant?

10:39.988 --> 10:41.121
Spiritual.

10:41.157 --> 10:43.757
Kramer had been hired to
investigate the Crowne family.

10:43.792 --> 10:46.560
Wait. Why would a P.I.
hire a spiritual consultant

10:46.595 --> 10:49.463
to help investigate a
billionaire philanthropist?

10:49.498 --> 10:50.730
[Chuckles]

10:50.766 --> 10:52.399
What? What is it?

10:52.435 --> 10:54.434
I know why Shaw came to this office.

10:54.469 --> 10:56.635
20 years ago,
this was Noah Kramer's office.

10:56.671 --> 10:59.305
Ooh, updating the murder board must mean

10:59.340 --> 11:01.340
- Holmby's alibi checked out?
- That it did.

11:01.376 --> 11:02.608
- Yes!
- Really?

11:02.643 --> 11:05.844
Come on. I'm just excited to
get off the whole orderly thing

11:05.880 --> 11:07.746
and on to the trail of the true killer,

11:07.782 --> 11:09.648
which is most likely
a road paved to hell,

11:09.684 --> 11:10.416
because we all know

11:10.452 --> 11:12.084
that's where demons come from.

11:12.119 --> 11:14.086
Well, I will be sure to cross reference

11:14.121 --> 11:16.988
Shaw's visitor against the
list of fallen angels, okay?

11:17.023 --> 11:19.191
Has Esposito gotten
the visitor logs yet?

11:19.226 --> 11:20.658
Well, he's trying, but the power outage

11:20.694 --> 11:22.794
is slowing everything down.

11:22.829 --> 11:24.529
Something wrong?

11:24.565 --> 11:26.764
Look at that.

11:26.800 --> 11:29.866
Yeah, it looks just like a lens flair.
Why?

11:29.902 --> 11:32.269
- There it is again.
- Weird.

11:36.209 --> 11:37.874
That's not...

11:37.910 --> 11:40.811
[Cellphone rings]

11:40.846 --> 11:41.945
[Cellphone beeps]

11:41.981 --> 11:43.080
Hey.

11:43.116 --> 11:45.715
Dad, Hayley and I did some digging,
and 20 years ago,

11:45.750 --> 11:46.949
Gabriel Shaw worked as a consultant

11:46.985 --> 11:50.220
for a P.I. named Noah Kramer
who worked out of your office.

11:50.255 --> 11:52.822
It's possible that Shaw
came there with the ax

11:52.857 --> 11:53.856
looking for Kramer.

11:53.891 --> 11:55.691
Well, it's a nice theory,
but Kramer's long dead.

11:55.727 --> 11:56.792
He was killed in an accident

11:56.828 --> 11:58.828
a year and a half after Shaw
was committed to Peakmore.

11:58.863 --> 12:00.029
What kind of an accident?

12:00.064 --> 12:02.731
He was impaled by a pipe that
fell at a construction site.

12:02.766 --> 12:03.932
Okay. That's horrible.

12:03.967 --> 12:07.202
But still, it's possible that
Shaw was delusional enough

12:07.238 --> 12:08.970
to believe that Kramer was still alive.

12:09.006 --> 12:10.339
Maybe. You know, Kramer's wife and kid

12:10.374 --> 12:11.406
still live in the city.

12:11.442 --> 12:14.476
Perhaps they can shed some
light on Shaw's motives.

12:14.512 --> 12:15.810
Give me an address for them.

12:15.846 --> 12:16.845
Write this down.

12:18.415 --> 12:20.148
Hang on, let me get a pen.

12:20.183 --> 12:22.517
- Gabriel Shaw is dead?
- Mm-hmm.

12:22.552 --> 12:24.485
We just saw him yesterday.

12:24.521 --> 12:26.020
Where?

12:26.055 --> 12:27.821
Well, he came by the house.

12:27.857 --> 12:29.890
He said he was released from Peakmore.

12:29.925 --> 12:31.058
What did he want?

12:31.093 --> 12:33.827
He was looking for stuff he
left with my dad 20 years ago.

12:33.863 --> 12:34.629
What kind of stuff?

12:34.664 --> 12:36.329
I don't know. I didn't ask. We...

12:38.534 --> 12:39.932
We didn't want anything to do with him.

12:39.968 --> 12:41.934
He ruined my dad's life.

12:41.970 --> 12:43.736
Marshall's too young to remember,

12:43.772 --> 12:48.608
but he's well aware of how
Gabriel Shaw ruined our family.

12:48.644 --> 12:50.777
After Shaw attacked the Crownes,

12:50.812 --> 12:53.779
my husband's reputation was destroyed.

12:53.814 --> 12:58.184
Noah was shocked to think
that a man he befriended

12:58.219 --> 13:01.853
could've hidden such... evil.

13:01.889 --> 13:04.756
[Scoffs] Noah thought the
work they had done together

13:04.792 --> 13:07.693
was a mistake and thought
it needed to be buried.

13:07.728 --> 13:08.927
So, do you have anything of Shaw's?

13:08.962 --> 13:11.028
Oh, no. No, after my husband died,

13:11.064 --> 13:12.897
I just couldn't bear
going into his office,

13:12.932 --> 13:15.966
so I-I hired a company
to sell off the furniture

13:16.002 --> 13:17.468
and just dump the rest.

13:17.504 --> 13:19.804
I told Shaw all of this before he left.

13:19.839 --> 13:21.038
What time was that?

13:21.074 --> 13:22.640
Around 5:00.

13:22.676 --> 13:25.643
That's still 3.5 hours
before he met his murderer.

13:25.679 --> 13:28.144
Did he mention anything about
where he was going next?

13:28.180 --> 13:31.481
No, but he said something in
Latin before he walked away.

13:31.517 --> 13:35.452
Do you remember what that was?
It could be very important.

13:35.487 --> 13:37.621
Mm.

13:37.656 --> 13:40.457
<i>Finis omnium...</i> I don't know.

13:40.492 --> 13:42.292
<i>Nunc est.</i>

13:42.328 --> 13:43.793
<i>Finis omnium nunc est.</i>

13:45.963 --> 13:47.996
Together: The end is upon us.

13:48.032 --> 13:50.566
I know why Shaw came here
wielding an ax last night.

13:50.602 --> 13:51.834
To commit unholy murder

13:51.869 --> 13:53.669
on two unbelievably exceptional women?

13:53.705 --> 13:55.404
Close, but no.

13:55.440 --> 13:57.240
He was trying to get in there.

13:57.275 --> 13:58.974
The safe?

13:59.009 --> 14:01.943
This was all drywalled over
when I rented the office.

14:01.978 --> 14:04.279
The contractors found it when
I was doing the renovations.

14:04.314 --> 14:05.347
The landlord thought
it had been removed,

14:05.382 --> 14:09.083
but clearly Noah Kramer
walled it up before he died,

14:09.119 --> 14:11.018
intent on burying whatever
he and Shaw were working on.

14:11.054 --> 14:12.954
That's why Shaw grabbed the ax...

14:12.989 --> 14:14.356
To try and break into the safe.

14:14.391 --> 14:16.991
- So, what's inside?
- I don't know.

14:17.026 --> 14:18.859
Wait a minute. You've never opened...

14:18.894 --> 14:20.026
Why the hell not?

14:20.062 --> 14:21.428
Schrodinger's cat.

14:21.464 --> 14:22.663
Oh, God. Is this another one of his...

14:22.698 --> 14:23.930
- Mm-hmm.
- Great!

14:23.966 --> 14:25.466
No, no. It's... look.

14:25.501 --> 14:27.167
If I opened it,
I was bound to be disappointed

14:27.202 --> 14:28.702
with whatever was inside.

14:28.738 --> 14:29.703
If I never opened it,

14:29.739 --> 14:32.373
literally anything I
imagine could be in there.

14:32.408 --> 14:34.174
So, you chose fantasy over reality?

14:34.209 --> 14:35.041
Well, duh.

14:35.077 --> 14:36.643
But we're going to open it now, right?

14:36.678 --> 14:37.410
Well, duh.

14:37.445 --> 14:38.478
When an ax-wielding psychopath

14:38.513 --> 14:41.814
is killed by a demon trying
to get inside, clearly,

14:41.849 --> 14:43.716
whatever's in there is worth seeing.

14:43.752 --> 14:45.485
If only...

14:45.520 --> 14:48.354
I knew someone who could crack a safe?

14:48.390 --> 14:51.457
It's a Jefferson Titanium 500 vault.

14:52.247 --> 14:53.992
Meaning?

14:54.027 --> 14:56.695
I need 28 minutes and
a chocolate milkshake.

14:56.730 --> 14:57.962
You're kidding.

14:57.998 --> 14:59.298
- Chocolate milkshake.
- Chocolate milkshake.

14:59.333 --> 15:00.666
Chocolate milkshake.

15:00.701 --> 15:02.000
- Captain.
- Yeah?

15:02.035 --> 15:03.868
According to Peakmore's visitor's logs,

15:03.904 --> 15:06.204
the person who came to see
Shaw was named Dennis Wormwood.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.506
Oh, good. Any luck finding him?

15:07.541 --> 15:08.540
No, because it's a fake name.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.641
Okay, well,
Peakmore must have security videos,

15:10.677 --> 15:12.042
so pull the feed, see if you can ID him.

15:12.077 --> 15:13.076
I did.

15:13.112 --> 15:14.211
Check this out.

15:17.116 --> 15:18.215
Oh, that's strange.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.250
Creepy is more like it.

15:20.286 --> 15:21.285
So, do you think Castle's right...

15:21.321 --> 15:24.322
No, no, no, no.
Don't even add fuel to that fire.

15:24.357 --> 15:27.056
Whoever gave the fake name
must've sabotaged the videos

15:27.091 --> 15:28.090
in order to keep that visit a secret,

15:28.126 --> 15:30.226
which makes him look even
more like our killer.

15:30.261 --> 15:31.494
All right, I'll keep digging.

15:31.530 --> 15:32.995
[Slurping]

15:33.031 --> 15:35.064
[Slurping continuing]

15:39.037 --> 15:41.070
[Slurping stops]

15:41.105 --> 15:43.972
Is this... this is... This is loud.
I'm gonna...

15:47.978 --> 15:50.011
[Clicking]

15:53.818 --> 15:55.884
[Loud click] Got it.

15:55.919 --> 15:58.887
Okay, it's your last chance

15:58.922 --> 16:02.557
to let your imagination run wild.

16:02.592 --> 16:05.460
- I'm good.
- Eh, maybe we shouldn't.

16:05.495 --> 16:08.730
Given the whole Satanic,
escaped-mental-patient angle?

16:08.765 --> 16:11.566
Alexis,
we can't let fear control our actions.

16:26.147 --> 16:29.483
[Sighs] Care to rethink that?

16:29.518 --> 16:31.385
Here we go.

17:19.632 --> 17:20.931
What is it all?

17:28.573 --> 17:31.707
Looks like research.

17:31.743 --> 17:33.175
Into what?

17:35.379 --> 17:37.379
The end of days.

17:37.415 --> 17:41.951
Which, according to this,
is two days from now.

17:45.984 --> 17:47.581
Ryan: Man, I hate walls of crazy.

17:47.673 --> 17:49.251
What if it's not crazy?

17:49.286 --> 17:51.286
Shaw believed the apocalypse
starts in two days.

17:51.322 --> 17:53.923
Then why did Shaw want to
get back inside of here?

17:53.958 --> 17:54.857
What was he after?

17:54.892 --> 17:55.991
Yeah. It's a good question.

17:56.026 --> 17:57.793
It's insane to think that
this has all been sitting

17:57.829 --> 17:58.861
right next to us all this time.

17:58.896 --> 17:59.962
It's twisted.

17:59.997 --> 18:02.331
Looks like they were following this boy,
Victor Crowne.

18:02.366 --> 18:04.131
Wait, Crowne. That was the family

18:04.167 --> 18:06.300
that Shaw tried to murder 20 years ago.

18:06.336 --> 18:07.234
Ryan: Yeah, I looked into them.

18:07.270 --> 18:09.838
Warren and Alice Crowne
were the parents.

18:09.873 --> 18:11.806
They had a nine-year-old
boy named Victor.

18:11.842 --> 18:13.875
What's worse,
after surviving Shaw's attacks,

18:13.910 --> 18:16.878
they were killed in a
freak skiing avalanche

18:16.913 --> 18:18.179
and Victor became an orphan.

18:18.214 --> 18:19.113
Alexis: Poor kid.

18:19.148 --> 18:21.348
Well, yes and no.
They were billionaires.

18:21.383 --> 18:23.283
Victor stood to inherit
the entire fortune.

18:23.318 --> 18:26.119
Are you kidding me?

18:26.154 --> 18:28.188
Guys, tell me you're seeing this.

18:28.223 --> 18:31.391
A targeted orphan standing
to inherit an empire

18:31.426 --> 18:34.327
in the center of a
religious Armageddon plot?

18:34.363 --> 18:35.696
Hello!

18:35.731 --> 18:37.464
It's "The Omen"!

18:37.499 --> 18:39.732
Shaw believed that Victor
Crowne was the Antichrist.

18:39.767 --> 18:41.233
The A... as in...

18:41.268 --> 18:43.402
As in the personification of the devil.

18:43.437 --> 18:45.404
Yes, dear. Yes. It...

18:45.439 --> 18:46.839
That's why Shaw went after the Crownes.

18:46.875 --> 18:49.308
He was going after their son.

18:49.343 --> 18:51.343
Except that was a film.

18:51.379 --> 18:52.277
Please don't tell me

18:52.313 --> 18:54.179
you are Googling the
Antichrist right now.

18:54.215 --> 18:56.247
I'm looking into Victor Crowne.

18:56.282 --> 18:58.149
He still lives here in New York.

18:58.184 --> 19:01.419
If Shaw believed that Victor
was some sort of devil,

19:01.454 --> 19:03.588
maybe that's why he escaped
from that institution...

19:03.624 --> 19:05.356
So that he could finish his mission.

19:05.392 --> 19:06.758
According to this article, in two days,

19:06.793 --> 19:08.727
Victor Crowne turns 30
and will gain full control

19:08.762 --> 19:10.395
over his parents' empire.

19:10.430 --> 19:12.863
That's it.

19:12.899 --> 19:16.500
Jesus began his ministry when he was 30.

19:16.536 --> 19:18.769
Many people believe that the Antichrist

19:18.804 --> 19:21.438
will begin his reign on
Earth at the same age.

19:21.473 --> 19:22.573
And that once his ascension has started,

19:22.608 --> 19:25.009
it cannot be stopped.

19:25.044 --> 19:28.678
Guys,
what if Victor Crowne <i>is</i> the Antichrist

19:28.713 --> 19:29.512
and Shaw isn't crazy?

19:29.548 --> 19:31.948
No, Rick. He was <i> very</i> crazy.

19:31.983 --> 19:33.049
Remember... He tried to kill a child.

19:33.084 --> 19:34.751
Esposito: You know,
we still haven't accounted for

19:34.786 --> 19:36.719
all of Shaw's time after he escaped.

19:36.755 --> 19:38.354
If he's still obsessed
with killing Victor,

19:38.389 --> 19:39.589
there's a chance he took
a run at him last night.

19:39.624 --> 19:43.026
Except Victor is a full-grown man now,
able to defend himself.

19:43.061 --> 19:45.194
And if Victor stabbed
Shaw in self-defense,

19:45.229 --> 19:47.128
he might be too afraid to come forward.

19:47.164 --> 19:48.363
We need to talk to this guy.

19:52.335 --> 19:55.403
Come on. Half the city is blacked out,

19:55.439 --> 19:57.639
but this place is lit up
like a Christmas tree?

19:57.675 --> 19:59.274
The lights probably run on generators.

19:59.309 --> 20:00.442
Sure.

20:00.477 --> 20:02.944
Thermoelectric generator
fueled by the flames of Hell.

20:02.979 --> 20:04.144
Check this out, you guys. Look at this.

20:04.180 --> 20:08.115
Billionaire entrepreneur hell-bent on
"saving the world"

20:08.150 --> 20:10.417
with his water reclamation project?
I'm sure.

20:10.453 --> 20:12.319
Ryan: Castle, by all accounts,
Victor Crowne has helped

20:12.354 --> 20:13.721
millions of impoverished people

20:13.756 --> 20:15.723
by providing them with
clean drinking water.

20:15.758 --> 20:17.558
Or is he infecting us with it?

20:17.594 --> 20:18.425
Ow!

20:18.461 --> 20:20.994
Gentlemen, follow me this way, please.

20:21.029 --> 20:23.830
You stole this from the
safe to protect yourself?!

20:23.865 --> 20:25.331
Castle!

20:25.366 --> 20:28.034
What?! You guys have guns.

20:31.940 --> 20:34.307
The NYPD.

20:34.342 --> 20:37.175
And Richard Castle in the flesh.

20:37.211 --> 20:38.811
[Chuckles] I'm fans of you all.

20:39.981 --> 20:43.248
Yikes! [Chuckles] You got a shock.

20:43.283 --> 20:45.350
Don't you hate when that happens?

20:45.385 --> 20:47.853
So, how can I help you fine gentlemen?

20:47.888 --> 20:50.455
Mr. Crowne, we just have some
questions about this man.

20:53.893 --> 20:56.628
I take it you recognize him.

20:56.663 --> 20:59.330
Gabriel Shaw. Hard face to forget.

20:59.365 --> 21:01.298
Have you seen him recently?

21:01.334 --> 21:03.367
Okay, what's this all about?

21:03.402 --> 21:04.368
Shaw is dead.

21:04.403 --> 21:06.638
He escaped from Peakmore
yesterday afternoon

21:06.673 --> 21:08.106
and was killed later that evening.

21:10.510 --> 21:11.374
You seem pleased.

21:11.409 --> 21:13.510
The man attacked my family, Mr. Castle.

21:13.545 --> 21:17.047
Don't expect me to shed
a tear over his demise.

21:17.082 --> 21:19.549
20 years, this face has haunted me.

21:19.584 --> 21:20.651
How's that?

21:20.686 --> 21:23.720
Days after his attack,
my parents and I left the city.

21:23.756 --> 21:26.456
My parents perished in a
freak accident on that trip.

21:26.491 --> 21:28.124
You blame Shaw for their deaths.

21:28.159 --> 21:29.625
He set those events in motion.

21:29.661 --> 21:31.560
That man forever cursed my life.

21:31.595 --> 21:34.630
But I've turned my pain into a blessing.

21:34.666 --> 21:36.398
Channeled all that negative energy

21:36.433 --> 21:40.235
into a plan for something good...
a better world.

21:40.271 --> 21:42.237
My clean-water initiative.

21:42.273 --> 21:44.573
We're launching a global
network of offices

21:44.608 --> 21:45.740
in just a couple of days.

21:45.776 --> 21:47.042
On your 30th birthday.

21:47.077 --> 21:50.244
As it so happens, yes.

21:50.280 --> 21:52.714
Well, I hate to have to ask you this,
Mr. Crowne,

21:52.749 --> 21:54.549
but where were you last night?

22:00.691 --> 22:02.890
Here. Working.

22:02.925 --> 22:04.758
Rollins can provide you
with surveillance tapes

22:04.794 --> 22:06.526
if you'd like to verify that.

22:06.562 --> 22:07.661
We're done here.

22:09.398 --> 22:10.630
Gentlemen.

22:15.437 --> 22:17.337
What is that...

22:17.372 --> 22:18.572
Something smells like...

22:18.607 --> 22:20.840
Sulfur.

22:20.875 --> 22:22.775
We had an accident during
a demonstration yesterday.

22:22.811 --> 22:24.744
I'm still working out the kinks.

22:29.584 --> 22:31.383
[Beep, ringing]

22:31.419 --> 22:33.452
[Door opens]

22:33.487 --> 22:35.188
Rollins: Detectives.

22:35.223 --> 22:37.422
I burned those copies of
our surveillance tapes.

22:37.457 --> 22:38.824
Thank you.

22:39.960 --> 22:41.559
Thanks, Rollins.

22:41.595 --> 22:43.628
Every floor for the last 48 hours.

22:43.663 --> 22:45.463
Thanks, Rollins. Really appreciate it.

22:45.498 --> 22:46.564
You're welcome.

22:54.140 --> 22:56.907
- Castle?
- Geez!

22:56.943 --> 22:58.408
What's with you?

22:58.444 --> 23:01.112
I-I'm... I'm marked for death.

23:01.147 --> 23:02.012
What?

23:02.048 --> 23:04.048
[Clears throat] I'm marked for death.

23:11.123 --> 23:12.622
[Siren chirping]

23:12.657 --> 23:14.891
Bro, you have to stop
watching these horror films.

23:14.926 --> 23:16.259
That same slash of light

23:16.294 --> 23:17.894
appeared in the crime-scene photos,
okay?

23:17.929 --> 23:20.396
In the exact same place...
Right across my neck.

23:20.431 --> 23:22.132
Now it's showing up
again in the video feed?

23:22.167 --> 23:24.634
That's live feed!
That cannot be manipulated!

23:24.669 --> 23:27.770
Castle, all this stuff about
omens and the Antichrist...

23:27.805 --> 23:28.804
You being marked for death...

23:28.839 --> 23:29.604
Together: It's all in your head.

23:29.640 --> 23:30.773
Guys... Look out!

23:36.346 --> 23:37.780
You were saying?!

23:40.162 --> 23:41.361
It was a frayed cable.

23:41.396 --> 23:44.636
Yes. Yes, I agree.
If by frayed cable, you mean <i> Satan.</i>

23:44.731 --> 23:46.330
Look, Castle,
don't take this the wrong way,

23:46.366 --> 23:47.832
but you're starting to sound crazy.

23:47.868 --> 23:50.834
And not your usual crazy,
I mean, next-level nutter.

23:50.870 --> 23:52.703
Beckett, listen to me.

23:52.738 --> 23:55.739
I looked into the cold,
soulless eyes of Victor Crowne,

23:55.775 --> 23:59.577
and let me tell you what I saw...

23:59.612 --> 24:01.011
<i>Evil.</i>

24:01.047 --> 24:03.480
Well,
I looked into the surveillance tapes

24:03.515 --> 24:04.414
from Victor Crowne's building,

24:04.450 --> 24:06.683
and let me tell you what <i> I</i> saw...

24:06.718 --> 24:08.918
Victor Crowne working all night.

24:08.954 --> 24:10.553
He never left the building, Castle.

24:10.589 --> 24:11.588
[Scoffs] He's not our killer.

24:11.623 --> 24:13.690
He's not gonna be bound by earthly laws,
Beckett.

24:13.725 --> 24:15.191
That's Demon 101.

24:15.226 --> 24:16.459
Yo, Cap.

24:16.494 --> 24:18.728
We're still not having any luck
figuring out where Shaw was

24:18.763 --> 24:19.762
during that time-of-death window.

24:19.798 --> 24:20.863
Well, someone must've seen him,

24:20.899 --> 24:22.657
so why don't we get unis to re-canvass?

24:22.697 --> 24:24.866
- All right.
- Yo, I just got a call from Lanie.

24:24.902 --> 24:26.668
Uh, do you remember the biblical verses

24:26.704 --> 24:27.803
painted all over our Vic's body?

24:27.838 --> 24:30.438
Well, the lab ran an analysis,
and the results are... odd.

24:30.474 --> 24:32.007
It's a paste made from a mixture

24:32.042 --> 24:36.011
of olive oil, cassia, cinnamon,
cymbopogon, and myrrh.

24:36.046 --> 24:39.014
Cymbopogon and myrrh?
I've seen this somewhere before.

24:39.049 --> 24:40.181
I swear it.

24:41.784 --> 24:43.918
- Go.
- All right.

24:43.953 --> 24:45.620
Castle: Hey, guys.

24:45.655 --> 24:46.854
Hey, Dad.

24:46.889 --> 24:48.789
You wouldn't believe some of
the stuff we're finding in here.

24:48.825 --> 24:51.058
Did you find a recipe?

24:51.094 --> 24:53.694
For what? Antichrist cookies?

24:53.730 --> 24:55.029
[Laughter] No, of course not.

24:55.064 --> 24:56.731
But, actually, I don't even know.

24:56.766 --> 24:59.132
All I know is I saw a letter
in here that had a recipe on it

24:59.167 --> 25:02.702
with olive oil, cassia,
cinnamon, cymbopogon, and myrrh.

25:02.738 --> 25:04.871
Wait, wait, wait a minute.
Why does that sound so familiar?

25:04.906 --> 25:06.372
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

25:06.407 --> 25:08.108
Uh...

25:08.143 --> 25:10.543
Yeah, here it is. Uh-huh.

25:10.578 --> 25:14.947
It's addressed to Gabriel
Shaw from a Karl Von Eckland.

25:14.982 --> 25:17.816
Now the letter goes on and on
and on about anointing oil.

25:17.852 --> 25:20.619
It was used in ancient times
to prepare the righteous

25:20.655 --> 25:22.420
for battle against demons,

25:22.456 --> 25:26.224
and the ingredients include
cymbopogon and myrrh.

25:26.260 --> 25:27.960
Okay, now listen to this part.

25:27.995 --> 25:30.763
"Find me when it's your
turn to answer the call.

25:30.798 --> 25:33.330
I will prepare you for
your battle against evil."

25:33.366 --> 25:34.966
Esposito:
And who's the guy who wrote that?

25:35.001 --> 25:36.600
Karl Von Eckland.

25:36.636 --> 25:38.269
We really need to talk to this guy.

25:38.304 --> 25:40.138
Well, um, he's dead.

25:40.173 --> 25:41.739
So, unless you have a Ouija board

25:41.775 --> 25:43.607
somewhere around here,
it might be a bit of a challenge.

25:43.643 --> 25:44.475
How did he die?

25:44.510 --> 25:45.910
Looks like he had a fatal heart attack

25:45.945 --> 25:48.179
on December 13, 1996.

25:48.214 --> 25:51.514
Ooh. That is just one month
after this letter was written.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.684
And a week after Gabriel
Shaw was sent to Peakmore.

25:53.719 --> 25:55.786
Wait a minute.
If Shaw was institutionalized,

25:55.821 --> 25:57.688
it's possible he didn't know
Karl Von Eckland was dead.

25:57.723 --> 25:59.322
Alexis: Which means after he broke out,

25:59.357 --> 26:00.791
he probably went to
Von Eckland's apartment

26:00.826 --> 26:02.826
to get prepared for his
supposed demonic battle.

26:02.861 --> 26:05.461
Ryan, who lives in Von
Eckland's apartment now?

26:05.497 --> 26:06.461
His son, Oscar.

26:06.497 --> 26:09.331
Looks like he moved in
after his father died.

26:09.366 --> 26:10.700
Nice place.

26:10.735 --> 26:13.869
It's very, uh... eclectic.

26:13.905 --> 26:16.172
Yeah, it's creepy as all hell,

26:16.207 --> 26:18.107
but it's my dad's old stuff.

26:18.142 --> 26:20.209
Never had the heart to
get rid of any of it.

26:20.244 --> 26:21.476
So, you didn't follow

26:21.512 --> 26:23.044
in your father's religious footsteps?

26:23.080 --> 26:24.679
[Chuckles] Hell, no.

26:24.715 --> 26:26.447
It's all mumbo jumbo.

26:26.482 --> 26:27.816
20 bucks?

26:27.851 --> 26:29.450
Hey, a man's got to eat, right?

26:29.485 --> 26:31.519
So, I make a little money on the side.

26:31.554 --> 26:33.855
You know,
selling blessed crap to suckers.

26:33.890 --> 26:36.157
Yeah, blessed candles, blessed crosses.

26:36.193 --> 26:38.359
Can I interest you in
a blessed bracelet?

26:38.394 --> 26:41.862
No, but, uh,
we are interested in this man.

26:41.897 --> 26:43.831
Was he here last night?

26:43.866 --> 26:46.834
Yeah. Around 6:00.

26:46.869 --> 26:48.235
Gabriel something?

26:48.270 --> 26:49.636
Was looking for my old man.

26:49.671 --> 26:51.171
He wanted your father to anoint him

26:51.207 --> 26:52.873
with the oil for spiritual battle.

26:52.908 --> 26:55.042
How do you know that?

26:55.077 --> 26:57.210
Did you anoint him, Oscar?

26:57.245 --> 26:59.578
For 50 bucks, hell yeah, I did.

26:59.614 --> 27:01.748
What? He was desperate,

27:01.783 --> 27:03.482
so I grabbed one of Pop's old books,

27:03.517 --> 27:06.418
and I whipped up a batch
of the anointing oil,

27:06.454 --> 27:09.889
and I, uh,
wrote some bible verses on him.

27:09.924 --> 27:11.490
It gave him great peace.

27:11.525 --> 27:13.859
Well,
that peace didn't last. The man's dead.

27:13.894 --> 27:17.195
Really? What happened to him?

27:17.231 --> 27:19.364
He was murdered...
by the spawn of Satan.

27:19.399 --> 27:21.800
- Is he serious?
- Very.

27:23.436 --> 27:24.870
So, Oscar, did Gabriel Shaw

27:24.905 --> 27:27.272
tell you whether he was meeting anyone?

27:27.307 --> 27:29.241
Did he say where he was going?

27:29.276 --> 27:31.408
No, just thanked me and left.

27:31.443 --> 27:34.511
- What time did he leave?
- A little after 7:30.

27:34.546 --> 27:36.446
Castle: That's 30 minutes
before Shaw was stabbed.

27:36.482 --> 27:38.215
Guys, we're getting close.

27:38.251 --> 27:40.550
Okay, so good and bad news.

27:40.586 --> 27:42.853
The good news is we found
surveillance footage

27:42.889 --> 27:45.722
of Shaw in Oscar's neighborhood

27:45.758 --> 27:46.957
and we were able to track him

27:46.993 --> 27:48.557
back to the location
where he was stabbed.

27:48.593 --> 27:49.926
You have video of Gabriel Shaw's murder?

27:49.961 --> 27:52.695
Well, yeah. Uh, sort of.

27:52.730 --> 27:54.764
Oh. This is where the bad news comes in.

27:54.800 --> 27:57.233
It appears that due to the thunderstorm,

27:57.269 --> 27:59.903
none of the cameras are
functioning properly.

27:59.938 --> 28:01.805
What does that mean?

28:01.840 --> 28:05.540
It... Uh...
It's just gonna be sort of... odd.

28:05.575 --> 28:07.943
Like <i> odd</i> odd? Or work of the Devil odd?

28:07.978 --> 28:10.813
No, just <i> odd</i> odd, Castle, all right?

28:10.848 --> 28:12.080
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

28:40.642 --> 28:43.076
That... is a demon.

28:43.111 --> 28:44.510
You guys, you did it.

28:44.546 --> 28:47.247
You have video of Gabriel Shaw

28:47.282 --> 28:49.415
killed by something not of this world.

28:49.451 --> 28:50.516
All right, Castle. Easy.

28:50.552 --> 28:52.352
Look, guys, I-I know it's late,

28:52.387 --> 28:54.420
but I need you to go
down to that loading dock

28:54.456 --> 28:56.088
and see what you can find, please.

28:56.123 --> 28:57.990
Both: Yeah.

28:58.025 --> 28:59.791
Thank you.

28:59.827 --> 29:01.426
I'm gonna go pack up.

29:01.462 --> 29:04.864
And, um... Castle?

29:04.899 --> 29:06.798
It's just a glitch.

29:19.913 --> 29:21.812
"And the beast shall rise

29:21.848 --> 29:23.668
and appear as astute and miraculous...

29:23.817 --> 29:25.817
The leader who comes into power

29:25.852 --> 29:28.486
on a platform of prosperity and peace."

29:30.220 --> 29:32.027
Or, in a nutshell,

29:32.146 --> 29:34.257
Victor Crowne.

29:34.293 --> 29:36.593
[Rattling in distance]

30:26.508 --> 30:28.976
[Gasping]

30:31.848 --> 30:33.147
Geez!

30:33.182 --> 30:34.715
[Laughs]

30:34.751 --> 30:36.250
Gotcha.

30:36.285 --> 30:37.917
Not funny, Beckett!

30:37.953 --> 30:39.685
I am being targeted by dark forces.

30:39.721 --> 30:40.720
I'm serious. I can feel it.

30:40.756 --> 30:42.856
Okay, fine.
Can you just feel it in the morning?

30:42.891 --> 30:45.424
'Cause it's late. Let's go to bed.

30:45.460 --> 30:47.193
Yeah, just give me a few minutes.

30:47.229 --> 30:48.461
All right.

30:51.299 --> 30:52.498
- Boo!
- Geez!

30:52.533 --> 30:54.800
[Laughs] You're so easy!

31:10.117 --> 31:12.759
The Angel Dagger.

31:14.923 --> 31:16.754
Where have I seen...

31:42.848 --> 31:44.514
[Cellphone ringing]

31:47.785 --> 31:49.185
[Cellphone beeps] Hey, Beckett.

31:49.220 --> 31:50.820
Hey, where are you?

31:50.855 --> 31:53.022
I'm at the office.
I figured out why Shaw broke in here.

31:53.057 --> 31:54.190
- Really?
- Yeah.

31:54.225 --> 31:55.858
He was looking for a weapon.

31:55.893 --> 31:58.127
It's the only thing that
can kill the Antichrist.

31:58.162 --> 31:59.061
It's called the Angel Dagger.

31:59.096 --> 32:01.463
[Sighs] Castle, would you please just...

32:01.498 --> 32:02.731
Beckett, I am serious.

32:02.766 --> 32:05.867
I-I found references to it on
the Internet, and it was here.

32:05.902 --> 32:07.434
It's been in the safe the whole time.

32:07.499 --> 32:10.455
I-It's a blade that was hidden in a...
[Electricity crackles]

32:11.574 --> 32:14.475
- Who's there?
- Who's where?

32:15.645 --> 32:17.678
Hello? Castle... [Door slams]

32:17.714 --> 32:19.880
[Whispering] He's here.

32:19.915 --> 32:21.481
Who?

32:22.712 --> 32:24.229
Castle?

32:25.554 --> 32:26.987
Hello?

32:39.036 --> 32:41.357
I saw his eyes. It was a demon.

32:41.437 --> 32:44.513
Or someone with night-vision goggles.

32:44.605 --> 32:47.481
Beckett, how much proof do you need
before you finally accept the fact

32:47.521 --> 32:49.249
that your husband has
been marked for death!

32:49.328 --> 32:50.910
Okay, if you were marked for death,

32:50.945 --> 32:52.077
then the demon would've killed you.

32:52.112 --> 32:54.747
Instead, you were knocked
out by a very human attacker

32:54.782 --> 32:57.616
who managed to run off with your...
w-whatever dagger.

32:57.652 --> 32:58.684
- Angel Dagger!
- Angel Angel Dagger.

32:58.719 --> 33:00.920
Angel Dagger.
It's something only a demon would want.

33:00.955 --> 33:03.087
Look, if that's true,
then why did the demon

33:03.122 --> 33:04.956
ransack your safe?

33:04.991 --> 33:06.090
Hello?

33:06.125 --> 33:08.426
To look for other items
with supernatural abilities. Is it...

33:08.461 --> 33:10.494
- What?
- Hey, Castle.

33:10.530 --> 33:11.996
How you doing, buddy?

33:12.032 --> 33:13.765
Well, boys,
I looked into the eyes of the devil,

33:13.800 --> 33:14.933
so there's that.

33:14.968 --> 33:16.768
Did they check him for a concussion?

33:16.803 --> 33:20.003
Uh, no. He's fine.
He's just a little shaken.

33:20.039 --> 33:21.939
You guys got anything on the canvass?

33:21.974 --> 33:23.607
Yeah,
a bouncer who was working at a club

33:23.642 --> 33:26.009
across the alley from where
Shaw's stabbing took place

33:26.045 --> 33:27.878
saw a gray Explorer
tear ass out of there.

33:27.913 --> 33:28.946
All right, did you get the plates?

33:28.981 --> 33:30.513
Nope, and we don't need them.

33:30.549 --> 33:32.649
Turns out there's only
one person in this case

33:32.685 --> 33:33.817
who has a gray Explorer.

33:33.852 --> 33:36.351
Oh, yeah? Well,
a lot of people have that kind of SUV.

33:36.387 --> 33:37.787
Yes, but not a lot of people

33:37.822 --> 33:39.655
have the murder weapon in their garage.

33:39.691 --> 33:41.958
See,
we got a search warrant for your place,

33:41.993 --> 33:46.428
and, uh, we found your garden claw.

33:48.432 --> 33:50.332
Oh. So, that explains

33:50.367 --> 33:53.702
the claw-shaped wound on Shaw's body.

33:53.737 --> 33:55.169
See, Castle?

33:55.205 --> 33:56.571
No demon.

33:56.607 --> 33:58.873
Yeah, then, uh, why was there sulfur,

33:58.909 --> 34:02.143
i.e. brimstone, found in Shaw's body.

34:02.178 --> 34:05.046
Our labs did an analysis
of the murder weapon,

34:05.082 --> 34:07.548
and not only did they find
traces of Shaw's blood on it,

34:07.584 --> 34:11.652
but they also found particles of
sulfuric gardening fertilizer,

34:11.687 --> 34:14.353
which matches the sulfur
we found in the wound.

34:17.092 --> 34:19.025
Anything else?

34:19.061 --> 34:21.161
Sondra: I was just trying
to talk some sense into him,

34:21.196 --> 34:25.197
but Shaw just started rambling

34:25.234 --> 34:28.900
about his mission to vanquish evil.

34:28.937 --> 34:32.404
<i>He</i> was the true evil.

34:32.440 --> 34:34.774
If all you wanted to do was talk,

34:34.809 --> 34:38.377
then why did you bring
the murder weapon?

34:38.411 --> 34:43.081
I keep tools for my
flower shop in my SUV.

34:43.118 --> 34:48.020
And, I don't know,
he just started going on and on,

34:48.054 --> 34:51.556
[voice breaking] and I grabbed the claw.

34:53.827 --> 34:58.063
20 years ago, that man ruined my family,

34:58.098 --> 35:02.933
and I couldn't let him do
it all over again to us.

35:02.969 --> 35:06.236
[Crying]

35:06.272 --> 35:07.872
Mrs. Kramer, why did you break into

35:07.907 --> 35:10.941
your husband's old office last night?

35:10.977 --> 35:13.610
[Crying] What are you talking about?

35:13.646 --> 35:15.646
There's no reason to lie now.

35:15.682 --> 35:17.247
We know you took the Angel Dagger.

35:20.251 --> 35:24.253
I was home all night with my son.

35:28.126 --> 35:31.861
If she wasn't the one who attacked me,
who the hell did?

35:33.765 --> 35:36.464
Yo, any evidence to help identify

35:36.500 --> 35:38.000
Castle's demonic assailant?

35:38.035 --> 35:40.069
No, but, Rick, whoever attacked you

35:40.104 --> 35:42.671
also took all of the files
on the Crowne family.

35:42.707 --> 35:44.439
That sneaky little devil.

35:44.474 --> 35:46.075
It's Victor Crowne. He did this.

35:46.110 --> 35:47.776
How do you figure?

35:47.812 --> 35:49.444
Well, clearly he's trying to
take possession of any weapon

35:49.479 --> 35:52.246
that could be used against him
and erase any and all evidence

35:52.281 --> 35:54.582
of his true identity
as the spawn of Satan.

35:54.617 --> 35:55.983
We already looked into Victor Crowne.

35:56.019 --> 35:57.251
He was out celebrating all night

35:57.286 --> 35:58.853
at a club for his 30th birthday.

35:58.888 --> 36:00.688
Okay,
who else is gonna go to such lengths?

36:00.724 --> 36:03.691
Well, we don't know,
but they left a souvenir.

36:03.727 --> 36:06.027
This was not in the original inventory

36:06.062 --> 36:07.628
of the safe's contents.
[Cellphone chimes]

36:07.663 --> 36:11.264
Yo, that's Oscar Von Eckland's bracelet.

36:11.299 --> 36:13.633
Why would he want the Angel Dagger?

36:13.668 --> 36:15.268
Because he was in on it the whole time.

36:15.303 --> 36:17.637
Do you remember the distorted image

36:17.672 --> 36:20.207
of Shaw's mystery visitor
at the psychiatric facility?

36:20.242 --> 36:22.275
Well, Vikram was able to clean it up.

36:24.847 --> 36:27.113
He said he didn't believe
in all this religious stuff.

36:27.148 --> 36:29.448
He lied,
and you all know what that means.

36:29.483 --> 36:30.883
That he's insane.

36:30.918 --> 36:33.052
No, unlike Shaw,
he has all his faculties,

36:33.087 --> 36:37.189
but Oscar, like his father before him,
is a true believer.

36:37.225 --> 36:39.024
He's gonna pick up where
his old man left off...

36:39.060 --> 36:42.027
- Complete the mission.
- Kill the Antichrist.

36:42.063 --> 36:44.863
Oscar's gonna assassinate Victor Crowne.

36:46.077 --> 36:47.608
Hey, Rollins, lock down the building

36:47.711 --> 36:50.379
- and secure Victor Crowne.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on?

36:50.432 --> 36:52.712
- Your boss is in danger.
- Have you seen this man?

36:52.748 --> 36:55.682
That's the notary who just
showed up with legal documents

36:55.717 --> 36:56.983
for Mr. Crowne to sign.

36:57.018 --> 36:58.551
Did you give him access to Mr. Crowne?

36:58.587 --> 37:00.553
Yes, but not without an escort.

37:00.589 --> 37:02.389
Varella, come in.

37:04.382 --> 37:05.703
Varella, what's your 20?

37:05.782 --> 37:07.550
- Where did they go?
- Basement.

37:07.985 --> 37:10.362
We're about to start a major renovation.

37:10.398 --> 37:12.564
Mr. Crowne's down there
alone walking the site.

37:16.069 --> 37:18.183
All right, let's split up.
You two go that way, we'll go this way.

37:18.249 --> 37:19.304
Got it.

37:22.042 --> 37:23.674
- Somebody's down.
- Yeah.

37:26.880 --> 37:28.078
He's still alive.

37:28.114 --> 37:30.080
All right, Castle,
drag him upstairs to safety, all right?

37:30.116 --> 37:32.182
- Yeah. Wait... me?
- Yeah.

37:33.453 --> 37:35.720
- By myself?
- Yes!

37:38.057 --> 37:39.857
Okay.

Oscar! Oscar.

38:28.805 --> 38:31.805
Castle! Do something.

38:31.841 --> 38:33.640
Don't do it.

38:33.676 --> 38:35.843
He is the beast.

38:35.878 --> 38:37.143
The lawless one.

38:37.179 --> 38:38.812
The son of perdition.

38:38.848 --> 38:40.647
All bad things.

38:40.683 --> 38:43.016
But thou shalt not kill, remember?

38:43.051 --> 38:46.252
He isn't human, so it's not murder.

38:46.288 --> 38:48.621
Good luck selling that
in a court of law.

38:48.656 --> 38:50.022
Enough!

38:50.057 --> 38:53.092
I have to stop the end of days.

38:53.127 --> 38:55.194
I promised my father.

38:55.229 --> 38:56.662
No! Don't! No!

38:58.199 --> 39:00.366
What have you done?!

39:00.401 --> 39:02.267
If I have to kill you first, I will!

39:08.509 --> 39:09.574
Oscar, look out!

39:16.850 --> 39:18.683
- Esposito: Castle!
- Ryan: Castle, where are you?!

39:18.719 --> 39:20.513
Over here!

39:20.654 --> 39:22.486
- You okay?
- Yeah, you?

39:22.522 --> 39:23.321
- Yeah.
- Good.

39:23.356 --> 39:24.622
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm still good. You?

39:24.657 --> 39:25.889
Yeah, I'm okay.

39:25.925 --> 39:28.492
Now that we know <i> you're</i> all okay,
can someone untie me?

39:28.528 --> 39:31.195
Right. Sorry.

39:31.230 --> 39:34.532
We're lucky those pipes
fell when they did, huh?

39:34.567 --> 39:36.801
Yeah. Lucky.

39:36.836 --> 39:38.703
Thank you for saving me.

39:38.738 --> 39:41.604
Just to be clear,
you really aren't the Antichrist, right?

39:41.640 --> 39:43.540
[Laughs]

39:43.575 --> 39:46.643
Ahh, I love your sense of humor.

39:46.678 --> 39:48.845
You saved my life.

39:48.880 --> 39:50.680
That means I owe you.

39:50.716 --> 39:55.518
So, whatever you want, just ask.
It's yours. Okay?

39:55.554 --> 39:57.486
Okay. [Clicks tongue]

40:02.493 --> 40:04.159
Did I just literally...

40:04.194 --> 40:06.595
make a deal with the Devil?

40:09.600 --> 40:12.501
So, Oscar's on his way to Peakmore

40:12.536 --> 40:14.469
for a full psych evaluation.

40:14.504 --> 40:15.970
Okay, well,
let's hope they can help him.

40:16.005 --> 40:17.137
I wouldn't hold my breath.

40:17.173 --> 40:18.706
They didn't do so great with Shaw.

40:18.742 --> 40:20.742
Hey, boss.

40:20.777 --> 40:22.477
What's your husband doing?

[Shutter clicking]

40:27.684 --> 40:31.651
Castle, this is getting out of hand.

40:31.687 --> 40:34.220
I'm... still marked for death.

40:34.256 --> 40:36.690
Oh, well,
you'd think that saving the Antichrist

40:36.725 --> 40:37.924
would actually give you a pass.

40:37.959 --> 40:39.726
You know, you mock,
but you're gonna miss me when I'm gone.

40:39.762 --> 40:41.094
You're not going anywhere.

40:41.129 --> 40:42.729
How can you be so sure?

40:43.766 --> 40:44.998
Take off your jacket.

40:45.033 --> 40:46.400
I really don't think this is the time...

40:46.435 --> 40:47.833
Take off your jacket.

40:52.707 --> 40:54.540
Okay, now take another selfie.

How...

41:05.585 --> 41:06.918
The zipper on your chest pocket.

41:06.953 --> 41:10.021
It was catching the light,
causing a flare.

41:10.056 --> 41:12.089
I'm not marked for death.

41:12.125 --> 41:14.459
You sound disappointed there.

Are you kidding? I'm thrilled.

Let's celebrate.

41:19.198 --> 41:21.232
Actually, I had something else in mind.

41:23.201 --> 41:25.602
We really could've done
movie night at my place.

41:25.638 --> 41:26.670
No, no. We need to get rid of

41:26.705 --> 41:28.305
some of the bad vibes in here.

41:28.340 --> 41:30.674
So, what are we watching... Rom-com?

41:30.709 --> 41:31.742
Action-comedy?

41:31.777 --> 41:33.744
Horror!

41:33.779 --> 41:35.813
- You're kidding.
- No.

41:35.848 --> 41:38.315
Oh, come on.
We just survived the ax man.

41:38.350 --> 41:40.783
A little Freddy-Jason
action will be cathartic.

41:40.819 --> 41:42.785
All right, but if I can't sleep tonight,

41:42.821 --> 41:44.353
I'm kicking your ass in the morning.

41:44.388 --> 41:46.756
In your dreams. [Sighs]

41:46.791 --> 41:49.024
[Creaking]

41:49.060 --> 41:50.827
- Hayley?
- Hmm?

41:57.801 --> 41:58.800
Run.

41:58.836 --> 41:59.734
Yep.

42:07.744 --> 42:10.048
That was genius.

42:10.153 --> 42:12.475
Now can we play naked Twister?
