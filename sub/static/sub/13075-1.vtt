01:02.795 --> 01:04.328
Cassie?

01:08.867 --> 01:11.569
What did I say about
needing more alone time?

01:11.637 --> 01:13.906
You need it
right now?

01:13.972 --> 01:16.075
Please don't argue.

01:18.677 --> 01:20.813
Well, you could give me
some notice.

01:23.615 --> 01:25.067
Where's Cassie?

01:25.068 --> 01:26.519
She's upstairs.

01:26.585 --> 01:28.486
Is she coming down?

01:28.554 --> 01:30.256
Not tonight. No.

01:31.990 --> 01:33.593
Cheers.

01:41.600 --> 01:43.368
What?

01:47.506 --> 01:49.674
You know that girl?

01:49.742 --> 01:51.644
I don't think so.

02:40.960 --> 02:44.263
The Massachusetts state
driver's manual?

02:44.330 --> 02:47.266
I have my road test
next week.

02:47.332 --> 02:50.401
And it's making you cry?

02:50.468 --> 02:52.405
No.

02:57.509 --> 03:00.478
Sweetie, you're really
freaking me out lately.

03:00.545 --> 03:01.881
I know.

03:04.917 --> 03:08.319
I'm sorry that I'm so...

03:08.387 --> 03:10.322
I'm sorry.

03:20.832 --> 03:23.969
I'm gonna take out
the trash, okay?

03:35.747 --> 03:38.383
-Can I help you?
-Hi.

03:38.450 --> 03:39.786
Hi.

03:41.887 --> 03:44.490
Do you know...
You know who I am?

03:44.556 --> 03:46.491
No.

03:46.558 --> 03:48.493
No idea at all?

03:49.995 --> 03:52.730
Should I?
Sorry.

03:52.798 --> 03:55.033
It's kinda weird.
I-I'm not a crazy person.

03:55.100 --> 03:56.435
I'm...

03:56.436 --> 03:57.770
Okay.

04:00.506 --> 04:02.608
Who are you?

04:02.675 --> 04:04.810
-Can I have a hug first?
-What?

04:04.877 --> 04:08.747
I'm sorry. I'm really
exhausted and nervous,

04:08.813 --> 04:11.918
and I... I really...
I need a hug.

04:16.521 --> 04:18.589
Thank you.

04:18.656 --> 04:19.992
Thank you.

04:23.896 --> 04:26.031
So?

04:26.098 --> 04:29.634
You're Davis Green.

04:29.701 --> 04:32.805
And I'm Alexis Green.

04:32.872 --> 04:35.841
And we're cousins.

04:38.843 --> 04:40.778
No, you have
the wrong person.

04:40.846 --> 04:42.314
No.

04:42.380 --> 04:46.651
No, your dad is Ronald Green. He's
a developmental psychologist.

04:46.718 --> 04:48.519
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

04:48.586 --> 04:50.488
And he doesn't have
any siblings.

04:50.555 --> 04:54.959
No, no. No, he does. He has
an older brother, my dad.

04:55.026 --> 04:58.964
And they just never,
like...

05:03.168 --> 05:04.736
You forgot the trash.

05:04.803 --> 05:06.972
Cassie, thi...

05:12.076 --> 05:14.413
Okay.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.749
I'm not who you're looking for.

05:16.815 --> 05:19.117
My dad doesn't have any siblings,
and I don't have any cousins,

05:19.185 --> 05:22.954
and we have the last name,
but it's pretty common, so...

05:23.021 --> 05:25.591
No, no.

05:25.658 --> 05:28.461
Please... Please leave.

05:37.569 --> 05:39.906
It was really nice
to meet you, Davis.

05:44.476 --> 05:47.812
Fuck!

06:17.709 --> 06:19.878
I have to tell you something.

06:54.719 --> 06:59.651
<b>THE AUTOMATIC HATE</b>

06:59.652 --> 07:02.652
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

07:05.790 --> 07:08.660
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you. You're very kind.

07:08.726 --> 07:11.863
I'm glad the applause sign
is still working.

07:11.930 --> 07:15.800
This is HD 115.

07:15.867 --> 07:18.237
Human Development.

07:18.303 --> 07:20.872
If you're looking for
"Heavy Drinking 115,"

07:20.939 --> 07:23.774
it's across the quad,
down the block to Mulligan's.

07:25.310 --> 07:28.779
Human development.

07:28.846 --> 07:34.019
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is a baby.

07:34.086 --> 07:36.855
One of the great
mysteries of life.

07:36.922 --> 07:41.159
Who is she?
What will she become?

07:41.225 --> 07:43.028
Will you be a painter?

07:43.095 --> 07:45.564
A head of state?

07:45.630 --> 07:48.299
A murderer?

07:48.367 --> 07:51.203
By the way you're looking at me
right now, I'm guessing the last.

07:51.269 --> 07:53.938
Thank you.

07:54.005 --> 07:58.009
And is it inevitable...

07:58.076 --> 08:00.177
What she will become?

08:00.245 --> 08:02.848
Is it predetermined?

08:02.915 --> 08:09.054
Or is someone, something out there
going to be transformative?

08:09.120 --> 08:11.722
Nature, nurture?

08:11.790 --> 08:14.660
That is the question.

08:16.095 --> 08:19.097
This class will bring us
to a closer understanding...

08:19.163 --> 08:22.867
that the question
is bullshit.

08:24.670 --> 08:27.639
The answer is
far more complex, subtle...

08:27.706 --> 08:31.009
than any black or white
conclusion.

08:31.076 --> 08:34.346
It is much more... gray.

08:36.048 --> 08:39.150
I want to thank Jane,
my PhD student...

08:39.217 --> 08:43.587
Thank you... who gave birth specifically
for the purpose of this class.

08:45.823 --> 08:50.861
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a spy among us.

08:50.928 --> 08:56.334
Sitting in the back, that bearded
gentleman, is my son, Davis.

08:56.402 --> 08:58.704
What has he become?

09:02.807 --> 09:06.077
You're still dating
the, ballerina?

09:06.144 --> 09:08.112
Cassie, yes.

09:08.179 --> 09:10.181
For almost two years now.

09:10.249 --> 09:12.618
It's been that long?

09:12.684 --> 09:14.852
Well, that doesn't mean that
you still can't take out...

09:14.919 --> 09:17.221
one of my beautiful,
brilliant PhD students...

09:17.288 --> 09:19.857
on an innocent little
museum date, does it?

09:19.924 --> 09:22.927
That's exactly what it means, Dad.
Cassie moved in.

09:22.995 --> 09:24.797
Right, right.

09:24.864 --> 09:28.667
See, I always thought she was one of those
fun things, you know, like a placeholder.

09:28.734 --> 09:30.335
Why'd you think that?

09:30.402 --> 09:32.304
Well, she's
a little bit impulsive.

09:32.370 --> 09:34.338
Emotional,
out of control.

09:34.405 --> 09:37.408
Yeah. So?

09:37.475 --> 09:39.677
Your mom will be ecstatic
to see you.

09:39.745 --> 09:41.113
Hi.

09:42.280 --> 09:43.815
Hi, Mom.

09:46.250 --> 09:48.819
<i>...that he is good
at creating jobs...</i>

09:52.890 --> 09:55.159
This can't be right.

09:55.226 --> 09:57.929
Four-letter word
for a World War II city.

10:00.298 --> 10:02.333
Rouen.

10:02.400 --> 10:04.769
It's St. Lo.

10:04.836 --> 10:06.270
You have to
abbreviate it.

10:06.337 --> 10:08.873
S-T-L-O.

10:08.941 --> 10:11.744
I hate when they don't tell you
that they are abbreviating.

10:13.077 --> 10:15.346
You just opened up
that whole corner though.

10:15.413 --> 10:18.283
And the riddle.

10:22.520 --> 10:26.057
I was thinking about cooking
for all of us. Anything you want?

10:27.392 --> 10:30.329
You're gonna do
your cooking thing?

10:32.764 --> 10:34.732
Okay.

10:34.799 --> 10:36.134
I ate already.

10:37.369 --> 10:42.307
But yeah, you should...
go do that.

12:07.359 --> 12:08.894
Hi.

12:10.062 --> 12:11.246
How's he doing today?

12:11.247 --> 12:12.430
He's fine.

12:12.496 --> 12:14.399
Lots of napping.

12:16.033 --> 12:17.936
Could you give us
a second?

12:18.003 --> 12:19.021
Yeah.

12:19.022 --> 12:20.038
Thank you.

12:39.323 --> 12:41.859
I'm sorry, Davis.

12:41.927 --> 12:44.296
Can I talk to you
about something?

12:55.908 --> 12:59.177
Y... You know, your mother
painted this, Ronnie.

12:59.244 --> 13:00.812
You mean Grandma
painted it.

13:02.147 --> 13:03.581
Right, Grandpa?

13:03.649 --> 13:05.150
I'm not Ronnie.
I'm Davis.

13:07.219 --> 13:08.554
Yeah.

13:11.456 --> 13:13.259
Is that my dad?

13:16.193 --> 13:17.562
Yep.

13:20.465 --> 13:22.535
And who's that?

13:23.634 --> 13:25.136
That's Joshua.

13:26.270 --> 13:27.905
What?

13:27.972 --> 13:31.075
Why, that's Joshua.

13:31.143 --> 13:32.478
Who's Joshua?

13:36.615 --> 13:39.084
We do not talk about Joshua.

13:40.217 --> 13:42.053
Why not?
Who is he?

13:44.121 --> 13:46.557
No, no, no, no.

13:50.528 --> 13:52.898
Easy. Okay.

13:52.965 --> 13:54.466
-Okay, okay.
-Ronnie!

13:54.533 --> 13:56.902
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Grandpa.

13:56.969 --> 13:58.403
Ronnie. Ronnie!

13:58.470 --> 14:00.138
-Okay, easy. It's okay.
-Ronnie!

14:00.205 --> 14:02.307
No, no, no, no.

14:02.374 --> 14:04.341
-Ronnie!
-Excuse me!

14:04.408 --> 14:06.511
-Can we get some help here, please?
-No, no, no, no, no!

14:15.721 --> 14:18.322
Everything's gonna be okay.

14:18.389 --> 14:21.025
I want you to look at me.
Right here.

14:21.092 --> 14:23.127
<i>...a fixed term next year.</i>

14:23.195 --> 14:26.298
<i>Interest groups spent more
than nine million dollars...</i>

14:26.365 --> 14:29.668
<i>to influence the outcome of this
year's statewide ballot questions,</i>

14:29.735 --> 14:31.620
<i>and the heavy offenders...</i>

14:31.621 --> 14:33.504
Who is he?

14:33.572 --> 14:35.539
<i>According to a new report
from the state office...</i>

14:35.606 --> 14:37.574
<i>of campaign
and political finances.</i>

14:37.642 --> 14:40.312
<i>WDUR's Shannon Mullen reports.</i>

14:40.379 --> 14:42.614
<i>The report shows
the biggest spending...</i>

15:02.100 --> 15:04.502
Davis, Davis, Davis, Davis!
Where are you going?

15:04.568 --> 15:06.203
-To check on Grandpa.
-Why?

15:06.270 --> 15:10.174
What's wrong? Is there another relative
you're afraid he'll tell me about?

15:10.241 --> 15:12.676
Davis, wait a second.
What did you say to him?

15:12.744 --> 15:15.447
All I did was ask him to explain
the painting. Do you want to?

15:18.149 --> 15:20.052
You have a brother?

15:22.153 --> 15:24.422
No, I don't.

15:24.489 --> 15:26.091
Not anymore.

15:26.158 --> 15:27.325
What happened?

15:30.461 --> 15:32.663
<i>I can't even begin
to explain it,</i>

15:32.730 --> 15:35.500
<i>nor is it any
of your goddamn business.</i>

15:40.272 --> 15:42.574
<i>There's a reason
this has been kept from you.</i>

15:42.640 --> 15:44.442
<i>Leave it alone!</i>

15:47.412 --> 15:50.950
<i>You don't know what you're about to do.
Trust me.</i>

16:42.667 --> 16:44.103
Hey.

16:44.903 --> 16:46.404
You know what time
they open?

16:47.873 --> 16:49.641
In about an hour.

16:49.707 --> 16:51.058
You work here?

16:51.059 --> 16:52.409
Nah, man.

16:52.476 --> 16:54.478
Just waiting for my refill.

16:54.546 --> 16:56.181
You too?

16:56.248 --> 16:57.749
Yeah.

16:57.816 --> 16:59.718
Wait, what?

17:04.189 --> 17:05.656
Check it out.

17:08.826 --> 17:11.127
What?

17:11.194 --> 17:13.664
I thought this was
a thrift shop.

17:13.731 --> 17:17.201
It is, man, but they've got
a dispensary inside.

17:19.538 --> 17:22.707
You know, they grow it
and sell it on their farm.

17:22.772 --> 17:27.178
If you don't tell them where you got
the address, I'll give it to you.

17:30.781 --> 17:33.183
I'll take that address.

17:35.753 --> 17:37.654
<i>Hi. This is Cassie.
Leave a message.</i>

17:37.721 --> 17:40.625
Hey, Cass, it's me.

17:40.692 --> 17:44.429
I have almost no service here,
so I hope you get this.

17:44.496 --> 17:47.499
I'm in a tiny town
called Dustin, New York,

17:47.566 --> 17:50.435
driving
to my uncle's farm.

17:51.635 --> 17:55.673
That girl who came
to visit me, Alexis...

17:55.740 --> 17:57.709
She wasn't lying.

17:57.776 --> 18:00.512
She's my fucking cousin.

18:00.578 --> 18:03.647
My dad has a brother
who I guess...

18:03.714 --> 18:05.616
Fuck!

19:03.040 --> 19:05.309
Today I caught
a girl shoplifting.

19:05.376 --> 19:07.345
Okay. And did you
call the cops?

19:07.412 --> 19:09.948
No, I let her keep it.
It was so cute on her.

19:10.015 --> 19:12.450
What? You can't just
give our clothes away.

19:12.517 --> 19:14.786
It was like... It would've been two
dollars, She couldn't afford it.

19:17.955 --> 19:20.857
You know we're open, right?
You can come in.

19:20.924 --> 19:24.461
Yeah. I'm just...
I'm just lookin'.

19:24.528 --> 19:25.864
Thank you.

19:39.576 --> 19:41.145
Who was that?

19:41.146 --> 19:42.713
He was just looking
at dresses.

20:23.121 --> 20:24.656
Hey, guys!

20:39.671 --> 20:41.306
Hello.

20:41.373 --> 20:43.575
Hey, Alexis.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.777
<i>Yeah?</i>

20:45.844 --> 20:47.379
It's Davis.

20:48.980 --> 20:53.951
Hi.
What do you want?

20:54.853 --> 20:56.388
Can you talk?

20:59.124 --> 21:00.659
Sure.

21:13.904 --> 21:15.706
Hey!

21:15.773 --> 21:17.741
Hey.

21:25.717 --> 21:28.853
Why... Why did we have to
meet all the way out here?

21:28.920 --> 21:31.422
'Cause it's fun.

21:31.489 --> 21:34.826
And my parents are home. I wanted to
make sure they didn't see me leave.

21:43.801 --> 21:46.069
Come on. I've got a
surprise for you.

21:46.136 --> 21:48.905
-You sure my car's okay back there?
-Yeah.

21:48.972 --> 21:50.457
You wanna tell me
where we're goin'?

21:50.458 --> 21:51.942
Nope.

21:52.009 --> 21:54.711
A hint maybe?

21:54.778 --> 21:56.548
There's some people
you need to meet.

22:01.685 --> 22:04.322
Ladies, come on out.

22:07.459 --> 22:11.763
Davis Green, this is Amanda
Green and this is Annie Green.

22:13.096 --> 22:15.500
He looks
a little like Dad.

22:15.567 --> 22:16.801
No, he doesn't.

22:16.802 --> 22:18.035
Not now.
When he was younger.

22:18.102 --> 22:22.573
Maybe in his hairline.

22:22.640 --> 22:24.609
Getting in?

22:27.545 --> 22:30.148
What? Are you mad I didn't
tell you about them before?

22:30.214 --> 22:31.750
No.

22:33.518 --> 22:36.453
This is fuckin' awesome.

22:40.557 --> 22:43.394
You like it?

22:54.172 --> 22:57.642
So, you have
any brothers or sisters?

22:59.243 --> 23:00.778
That's too bad.

23:03.114 --> 23:07.052
Beer.

23:09.586 --> 23:11.655
So, do you guys have any
idea what happened?

23:11.722 --> 23:12.906
You mean with our dads?

23:12.907 --> 23:14.090
Yeah.

23:14.157 --> 23:16.793
Alexis tried to
bring it up once, but...

23:16.861 --> 23:18.830
-Yeah, that didn't go too well.
-We got threatened.

23:18.896 --> 23:20.464
So we dropped it.

23:20.531 --> 23:25.769
Dad said that if we tried to make
contact with you or your dad, then...

23:25.836 --> 23:28.706
-Then what?
-Bad things.

23:33.144 --> 23:36.681
Wait. You were at the store
today, weren't you?

23:36.748 --> 23:39.049
-Yeah.
-Were you spying on us?

23:39.116 --> 23:41.519
No! No.
Not... Not really.

23:41.586 --> 23:43.820
Alexis stalked me
all over Boston.

23:43.887 --> 23:46.590
Unemployed students have
time to do stuff like that.

23:46.657 --> 23:47.825
Fuck off, Amanda.

23:49.560 --> 23:53.096
So, do you have
a girlfriend?

23:53.163 --> 23:55.433
Any of you
have boyfriends?

23:59.971 --> 24:01.672
So, what's she do?

24:01.739 --> 24:04.808
She's a dancer at the
Charles Ballet of Boston.

24:04.875 --> 24:06.743
She seems really nice.
She's pretty.

24:06.810 --> 24:08.446
Wait, you met her?

24:09.881 --> 24:11.849
Kinda.

24:11.915 --> 24:14.519
So, how did you find me?

24:14.586 --> 24:16.988
Well, I...

24:17.055 --> 24:19.757
I saw your dad in one
of my psych textbooks,

24:19.824 --> 24:21.692
and then,
I googled him,

24:21.759 --> 24:25.096
and I saw that you went
to Yale, and then I...

24:25.163 --> 24:29.267
Well, I found your
restaurant online, and so...

24:29.334 --> 24:31.836
She's a stalker.

24:31.903 --> 24:33.805
Look at that.

24:36.708 --> 24:38.309
So you went to Yale?

24:38.375 --> 24:40.310
Yeah, for psychology.

24:40.377 --> 24:41.812
So what do you do now?

24:41.813 --> 24:43.246
I'm a chef.

24:43.314 --> 24:46.050
So mostly, I just
disappoint my parents.

24:46.116 --> 24:49.720
Yeah, they're not too happy
about that decision.

24:49.787 --> 24:50.838
Are you a sous chef?

24:50.839 --> 24:51.889
I'm a head chef.

24:51.955 --> 24:54.125
That must be
a powerful position.

24:54.192 --> 24:56.560
In the kitchen.
Not in life, really.

24:56.627 --> 24:58.896
God, Alexis,
we're in public.

25:02.066 --> 25:03.834
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

25:03.901 --> 25:08.105
It's just that I find it...
It's really sad, you know?

25:08.172 --> 25:09.973
What is?

25:10.040 --> 25:12.143
That we didn't
grow up together.

25:12.210 --> 25:15.346
Alexis, you haven't had
that much to drink...

25:15.413 --> 25:17.280
-Yes, she has.
-Maybe she should stop.

25:17.347 --> 25:19.916
I'm not drunk, okay?

25:19.983 --> 25:22.086
We apologize.
She is drunk.

25:22.153 --> 25:24.689
It's okay.

25:27.224 --> 25:28.759
Shit.

25:32.262 --> 25:35.832
My gosh.
Look who it is.

25:35.900 --> 25:38.269
-Who's he?
-Annie used to fuck him.

25:38.336 --> 25:41.205
You used to fuck that guy?

25:42.272 --> 25:43.940
Off and on.

25:44.008 --> 25:45.777
I thought we were dating,
but then...

25:47.278 --> 25:51.015
On the Fourth of July, I
accidentally went down on him.

25:52.950 --> 25:54.951
Accidentally?

25:55.019 --> 25:57.188
How do you accidentally...

25:57.255 --> 25:59.757
No. Never mind. That's
happened to me too.

25:59.824 --> 26:01.859
I am still pissed at you, Alexis.
I really liked him.

26:01.925 --> 26:04.729
I didn't even know
you guys were...

26:04.796 --> 26:07.999
And-And you are
way better off anyway.

26:08.066 --> 26:13.704
It is a small town, which increases the
odds of something like that occurring.

26:20.044 --> 26:22.213
-What?
-What?

26:22.279 --> 26:24.682
I fucked him too.
Just once, okay?

26:26.116 --> 26:27.951
You knew about this?

26:28.019 --> 26:30.253
That's a lot
of coincidences.

26:30.320 --> 26:31.855
I...

26:32.957 --> 26:34.825
No, Amanda,
give me your purse.

26:34.892 --> 26:36.728
-Why?
-Just give her your purse.

26:38.128 --> 26:40.430
I'm gonna fix this.
I'm really sorry.

26:40.498 --> 26:43.067
I'm gonna make it up to you.
I love you.

26:43.134 --> 26:45.001
Where the fuck
are you going?

26:45.068 --> 26:46.936
She has a knife.

26:47.003 --> 26:48.339
Come on.

26:50.974 --> 26:52.442
-Hey, Teddy.
-Hey.

26:52.509 --> 26:53.778
How are you?

26:53.779 --> 26:55.046
What do you want,
Alexis?

26:55.113 --> 26:56.181
You're looking so good.

26:56.182 --> 26:57.248
Fuck off.

26:57.315 --> 27:00.217
Honey,
you got something...

27:00.284 --> 27:01.752
What the...

27:01.818 --> 27:04.623
-What the fuck!
-Easy.

27:05.189 --> 27:06.891
Fucking whore!

27:09.292 --> 27:12.296
My... Go, go, go, fast! Go fast!

27:16.000 --> 27:17.335
Come here!

27:18.236 --> 27:20.104
What the hell was that?

27:20.171 --> 27:22.338
That was amazing
is what it was!

27:22.405 --> 27:24.841
-Have you ever punched anyone before?
-No!

27:24.909 --> 27:26.427
Why, did it look
like I had?

27:26.428 --> 27:27.945
No!

27:28.011 --> 27:29.846
This is for you.

27:29.913 --> 27:32.348
Let's get the fuck out of here!

28:19.130 --> 28:22.333
Now, be super fucking quiet
because Mom sleeps light.

28:22.400 --> 28:24.835
Wait, where are they?

28:24.902 --> 28:27.838
Don't worry. This is our space.
They never come down here.

28:30.007 --> 28:31.976
Do you not wanna stay?

28:32.042 --> 28:34.477
I just don't wanna
meet them yet.

28:34.545 --> 28:37.914
Well, you know, we could set you an
alarm and get you out of here early.

28:37.981 --> 28:39.450
Yeah.

28:39.517 --> 28:40.985
-Good night.
-Yeah.

28:43.119 --> 28:45.054
Good night.

28:45.122 --> 28:46.725
-Good night.
-Good night.

28:50.161 --> 28:52.062
You can take my bed.

28:54.097 --> 28:56.032
-I'll just...
-That's where you sleep?

28:56.099 --> 28:58.501
Yeah.!

28:58.568 --> 28:59.837
Where will you go?

28:59.838 --> 29:01.105
On the floor.

29:01.172 --> 29:03.339
No. No, I'll stay on...

29:03.406 --> 29:04.958
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

29:04.959 --> 29:06.510
Thank you.

29:13.150 --> 29:15.352
As you can see,

29:15.419 --> 29:17.421
it's kinda hard to
bring guys back here.

29:17.488 --> 29:19.590
Because of your parents?

29:19.656 --> 29:23.127
No, they don't care. It's just
a small space for three girls.

29:24.494 --> 29:26.229
Why not move out?

29:26.297 --> 29:29.901
Don't let the farm fool you.
We're pretty broke.

29:31.269 --> 29:33.304
So you date a lot?

29:33.371 --> 29:35.005
No.

29:35.071 --> 29:37.473
I mean, I try.

29:37.540 --> 29:40.410
I just... I have shitty luck.

29:42.313 --> 29:44.282
I pick
all the wrong ones.

29:48.685 --> 29:51.454
Like that guy in the bar?

29:51.521 --> 29:55.859
That's not shitty luck.
That's shitty taste.

29:55.926 --> 30:00.263
Yeah, well, there aren't
many options up here.

30:00.330 --> 30:05.001
Well, from now on, every guy you
date has to be approved by me.

30:05.068 --> 30:07.070
That's sweet.

30:11.308 --> 30:12.876
Hey, Davis?

30:17.381 --> 30:19.817
I decided
I like you now.

30:20.718 --> 30:23.221
I like you too.

31:33.490 --> 31:36.160
That can't be comfortable.

31:37.461 --> 31:39.364
It's not really.

31:50.141 --> 31:52.209
Mom.

31:52.276 --> 31:56.080
Th...
This is...

31:56.146 --> 31:57.748
John.

31:57.815 --> 32:01.317
Well, breakfast will
be ready shortly, John.

32:01.384 --> 32:04.320
Thank you,
but I...

32:04.387 --> 32:06.522
We have
only one rule here.

32:06.589 --> 32:08.725
If you can't bring a guy
to the table,

32:08.792 --> 32:11.661
you probably shouldn't
be sleeping with him.

32:11.729 --> 32:13.663
That's not a rule.

32:13.730 --> 32:15.032
Well, it should be.

32:15.033 --> 32:16.333
And we're not...

32:16.400 --> 32:18.703
Right.
I'll see you upstairs.

32:26.210 --> 32:28.545
So much for your sisters
waking us up early.

32:28.612 --> 32:30.447
Yeah, I bet
they overslept too.

32:30.513 --> 32:32.382
How are we
gonna do this?

32:32.450 --> 32:34.418
Well, my mom
didn't recognize you.

32:34.484 --> 32:36.652
What about your dad?

32:36.720 --> 32:39.089
Let's just say
you're my boyfriend.

32:59.242 --> 33:01.711
Dad, this is Jonathan.
We're dating.

33:04.115 --> 33:05.750
Hi, Jonathan.

33:07.151 --> 33:08.752
What happened
to the last guy?

33:08.818 --> 33:10.488
Dad shot him.

33:12.789 --> 33:15.158
You're not a vegetarian,
are you?

33:15.226 --> 33:18.128
-No.
-Good. Keep cutting.

33:18.194 --> 33:21.298
So, Jonathan,
how did you two meet?

33:21.365 --> 33:23.299
He was my TA.

33:23.366 --> 33:25.601
Yeah? For what class?

33:25.669 --> 33:27.672
Developmental Psych.

33:31.342 --> 33:32.777
You want some eggs?

33:32.778 --> 33:34.211
Sure.

33:34.278 --> 33:36.246
I'm sorry.
We're out of bacon.

33:36.313 --> 33:39.116
Amanda, go kill another pig
after breakfast.

33:39.182 --> 33:42.486
-I can't do it today. Make Alexis do it.
-Gross.

33:42.553 --> 33:45.689
I have to work two jobs and now this?
Yeah, that's fair.

33:45.756 --> 33:47.557
I'm not doing it.
Annie, you do it.

33:47.625 --> 33:49.859
-I have to open the store.
-Fine.

33:49.926 --> 33:52.663
Jonathan and I
will do it.

33:52.730 --> 33:54.565
I'm sorry?

33:54.632 --> 33:56.600
I'm stuck out here in the
woods with four women.

33:56.666 --> 33:59.302
First time a guy's
been around in a while.

33:59.369 --> 34:02.138
I don't know
how much help I would be.

34:02.205 --> 34:04.307
Well, you're fucking
my daughter.

34:04.375 --> 34:08.344
The least you can do is keep me
some company while I kill a pig.

34:08.411 --> 34:09.862
Joshua.

34:09.864 --> 34:11.313
Dad!

34:26.329 --> 34:28.264
Are the pigs
back there?

34:28.331 --> 34:32.869
No. Pigs stink like shit. We
don't keep them near the house.

34:32.936 --> 34:34.471
Get in.

34:49.219 --> 34:51.221
Just so you know, sir,

34:51.288 --> 34:54.657
I would never even think about
sleeping with your daughter.

34:54.724 --> 34:56.626
Now, that sounds
like an insult.

34:56.693 --> 35:01.164
No. I mean, I would.

35:01.231 --> 35:03.134
I'm just not.

35:32.762 --> 35:34.197
What does that do?

35:34.264 --> 35:37.534
Kills the pig on contact. This
way you don't have to bleed it.

35:37.601 --> 35:40.537
Very little suffering.
Very humane.

35:40.603 --> 35:43.439
What now? We just go
in there and zap one?

35:43.507 --> 35:46.911
I'll tell you what now.
Stop fucking with me!

35:51.882 --> 35:53.550
Yes, sir.

35:53.617 --> 35:56.385
He send you here
to spy on me?

35:56.452 --> 35:57.870
Who?

35:57.871 --> 35:59.288
Don't insult
my intelligence, man.

35:59.356 --> 36:01.658
I know you're
my brother's son.

36:04.927 --> 36:08.431
Actually, your daughters
said I look a bit like you...

36:08.498 --> 36:10.500
when you were younger.

36:14.570 --> 36:16.673
I don't see it.

36:42.432 --> 36:44.367
So did you go to college?

36:44.434 --> 36:47.637
Yeah. Why do you ask?

36:47.704 --> 36:49.773
Just curious...

36:49.840 --> 36:52.309
if maybe you'd also
studied psychology.

36:52.376 --> 36:54.278
I studied philosophy.

36:55.612 --> 36:56.997
Did you go to Yale too?

36:56.998 --> 36:58.382
No way.

36:58.449 --> 37:01.585
Fuck that place.

37:01.652 --> 37:03.554
I went to Harvard.

37:24.541 --> 37:27.510
Sorry I didn't get
to see you grow up.

37:27.577 --> 37:29.447
It's all right.

37:30.780 --> 37:33.416
So, what now?

37:33.483 --> 37:35.920
Nothing.
Have a good life.

37:37.688 --> 37:39.856
That's it?

37:39.922 --> 37:41.307
You don't want to see him?

37:41.308 --> 37:42.692
Nope.

37:42.760 --> 37:45.562
-Why not?
-Plenty of reasons.

37:45.628 --> 37:47.113
Give me one.

37:47.114 --> 37:48.597
Because he doesn't
want to see me.

37:48.664 --> 37:51.869
You guys are brothers. What
could have possibly happened?

37:55.172 --> 37:58.974
Why the fuck do you think
I'd tell you that?

37:59.041 --> 38:03.447
What we have between us,
it's unresolvable.

38:03.514 --> 38:05.882
If I knew what happened,
would I hate you?

38:05.949 --> 38:08.985
It was nice
to meet you, Davis.

38:22.599 --> 38:24.501
Wh... Where are you going?

38:24.568 --> 38:26.836
I need you to drive me
back to my car.

38:28.438 --> 38:29.873
Why?

38:29.940 --> 38:31.907
He knew who I was, Alexis,

38:31.974 --> 38:34.010
as soon as he saw me.

38:35.679 --> 38:37.914
Okay. So here's what we'll do.
We'II...

38:37.981 --> 38:40.718
No, I need you to
drive me back to my car.

38:42.152 --> 38:44.721
No.

38:44.788 --> 38:47.423
Then I'll walk.

38:47.490 --> 38:49.492
You're just... What?

38:52.896 --> 38:54.598
Davis.

38:54.664 --> 38:56.900
Davis.
Davis, wait, please.

38:56.967 --> 38:59.135
Your dad
asked me to leave.

38:59.202 --> 39:01.137
So what? I have to do
this all by myself?

39:01.204 --> 39:02.938
Do what?

39:03.005 --> 39:05.574
Find a way to get our
families back together.

39:05.641 --> 39:07.042
That's what you want to do?

39:07.110 --> 39:08.845
Unless I'm
imagining things,

39:08.911 --> 39:11.080
it seems like you were
enjoying your break up here.

39:11.148 --> 39:13.617
Wait. What?

39:14.585 --> 39:16.987
From your girlfriend.

39:17.054 --> 39:18.655
Break?

39:18.722 --> 39:20.957
I... I-I didn't mean it
like that.

39:21.023 --> 39:24.860
I just mean you were
having a good time,

39:24.927 --> 39:28.932
and I picked up on a vibe that
you guys are having problems.

39:30.567 --> 39:32.135
Sorry to pry.

39:32.202 --> 39:34.372
She had an abortion, Alexis.

39:36.072 --> 39:38.608
My gosh.

39:40.811 --> 39:45.583
Yeah, so that brought up
a lot of shit between us.

39:48.918 --> 39:51.821
Davis, I'm so sorry.

39:51.889 --> 39:54.024
Yeah, thanks.

39:57.260 --> 40:00.597
So, what if I stayed?

40:02.065 --> 40:04.568
What's your plan?

40:04.635 --> 40:07.471
I don't know,
but if you do,

40:07.538 --> 40:09.840
I know that we'll
figure something out.

40:09.907 --> 40:14.144
And now we've stirred it all
up, it's dumb to just drop it.

40:19.916 --> 40:22.952
I can't believe
I'm just meeting you now.

40:31.961 --> 40:33.697
I'll come back to visit.

40:34.731 --> 40:36.933
Okay?

40:37.000 --> 40:38.536
I promise.

40:42.905 --> 40:44.807
Promise me
something else.

40:44.875 --> 40:46.210
What?

40:47.945 --> 40:50.514
That if you do leave now,

40:50.581 --> 40:53.550
it's not because you're
afraid of what's going on.

40:54.717 --> 40:56.719
I'm not afraid
of what's going on.

41:00.856 --> 41:03.226
Not with our dads.
With us.

41:15.005 --> 41:16.606
No?

41:29.251 --> 41:30.788
Okay.

41:33.322 --> 41:36.059
Come on. I'll take you
to your car.

41:52.041 --> 41:53.877
Alexis?

41:55.344 --> 41:58.247
I do know
what's going on,

41:58.315 --> 42:01.519
but I promise that's not
why I'm leaving.

42:02.985 --> 42:04.521
No?

42:09.226 --> 42:13.197
-What the fuck are you doing?
-I need to show you something before you leave.

42:26.208 --> 42:28.677
How long is this
gonna take?

42:28.744 --> 42:30.580
Just a few minutes.

42:51.101 --> 42:53.769
What is this place?

42:53.836 --> 42:57.007
Well, when we were little, my parents got
in a fight and I followed my dad here.

42:57.074 --> 42:59.909
He doesn't know
I know about it.

42:59.976 --> 43:02.112
There's so much stuff.

43:06.782 --> 43:09.351
I know.

43:09.418 --> 43:11.621
Here. Look at this.

43:39.416 --> 43:41.051
What's up here?

43:42.418 --> 43:44.253
I have no idea. What?

43:54.898 --> 43:56.200
Come up here.

44:24.927 --> 44:26.797
It's plugged in.

44:32.936 --> 44:34.271
Should we?

45:07.603 --> 45:09.838
Jesus.

45:09.905 --> 45:11.157
What?

45:11.158 --> 45:12.409
I think that's my dad.

45:14.277 --> 45:16.847
The one on the right.

45:18.380 --> 45:20.215
He's handsome.

45:25.121 --> 45:27.222
-Is the other one your dad?
-Yeah.

45:31.494 --> 45:34.331
They look so happy.

45:42.539 --> 45:44.742
Is that your mom, maybe?

45:46.509 --> 45:50.079
No. Yours?

45:50.146 --> 45:51.515
No.

45:53.949 --> 45:55.985
She's so pretty.

46:47.237 --> 46:49.338
No, wait. There's more.

48:00.210 --> 48:02.412
Could this all be over a girl?

48:07.717 --> 48:09.452
Maybe.

48:41.617 --> 48:44.119
You coming down?

48:44.186 --> 48:46.389
Yeah, one second.

49:05.407 --> 49:07.710
Look what I found!

49:07.777 --> 49:11.347
Look, it's the one the girl
was wearing in the film.

49:14.150 --> 49:16.219
Put it back.
Carefully.

49:21.356 --> 49:23.492
Let's just leave everything
exactly as it was.

49:42.778 --> 49:45.181
Your dad seemed really
into that girl.

49:45.248 --> 49:47.516
Yeah, they both did.

49:47.583 --> 49:50.786
She was pretty.

49:50.853 --> 49:53.122
Thank you for bringing me here.

52:03.518 --> 52:05.354
We should go.

53:19.896 --> 53:21.664
Holy shit.

53:21.731 --> 53:23.016
What?

53:23.017 --> 53:24.301
Stop the car.

53:24.934 --> 53:26.535
Stop the car!

53:30.005 --> 53:33.342
What the fuck?

53:36.612 --> 53:38.447
What are you doing here?

53:38.514 --> 53:40.583
Davis. Thank God.

53:40.650 --> 53:42.451
I came to look for you.

53:42.518 --> 53:45.487
Hi.

53:45.554 --> 53:47.022
I don't know
what happened.

53:47.090 --> 53:48.923
I just can't get
the car to start.

53:48.990 --> 53:51.326
I tried calling AAA, but I can't
get anybody on the phone.

53:51.393 --> 53:52.927
There's no reception
or something.

53:52.994 --> 53:54.829
-What?
-Is that her?

53:54.896 --> 53:56.632
Davis, a tow's
gonna take forever.

53:56.699 --> 53:58.401
We've got jumper cables
at the house.

53:59.702 --> 54:02.305
Hi... again.

54:02.371 --> 54:04.339
Maybe I left the
lights on overnight.

54:04.407 --> 54:08.010
You know, it's Kristin's car and I
don't know what all the buttons do.

54:09.545 --> 54:12.347
Well, we could jump it.

54:12.414 --> 54:13.465
You think she can help?

54:13.466 --> 54:14.516
Yep.

54:15.418 --> 54:16.818
You okay?

54:16.885 --> 54:18.554
Yeah, I'm okay.

54:18.621 --> 54:19.772
You sure?

54:19.773 --> 54:20.923
Yeah.

54:23.626 --> 54:26.796
So, how did you find me?

54:26.862 --> 54:29.964
I drove into the main part
of town. I just asked around.

54:31.300 --> 54:34.437
So, Cassie, what brings
you all the way up here?

54:34.503 --> 54:37.406
I'm here to talk to
Davis about something.

54:39.409 --> 54:42.345
You mind giving us
just a second?

54:42.411 --> 54:43.846
I called a lot.

54:45.547 --> 54:47.015
You not picking up?

54:47.083 --> 54:49.684
Yeah. I've got
bad, cell service.

54:53.588 --> 54:55.458
Davis.

54:55.525 --> 54:59.061
Your parents actually
asked me to find you.

54:59.128 --> 55:02.565
But you didn't tell them
I was here, did you?

55:02.632 --> 55:04.467
Yeah, I did.

55:04.534 --> 55:07.135
-Cassie!
-I'm sorry. It was important to them.

55:10.873 --> 55:12.541
Sweetie,

55:13.775 --> 55:16.413
I wanted to wait until
we were alone...

55:20.949 --> 55:23.986
Babe, your grandfather
passed away.

55:28.490 --> 55:30.893
I'm so sorry.

55:33.728 --> 55:35.998
<i>The last time I saw him...</i>

55:37.599 --> 55:40.101
I asked
about your dad,

55:40.168 --> 55:45.040
and he...
freaked out...

55:46.809 --> 55:50.747
and had, like,
a panic attack or something.

55:53.114 --> 55:54.682
This is my fault.

55:54.750 --> 55:56.619
No.

55:56.686 --> 55:58.653
No, no, no, sweetie.

55:58.721 --> 56:00.889
Sweetie, he was old.

56:00.956 --> 56:03.192
What was he like?

56:03.259 --> 56:07.463
He was charming.
Smart.

56:08.530 --> 56:12.067
But he was stubborn,
like my dad.

56:12.068 --> 56:13.769
<i>Like your dad...</i>

56:13.835 --> 56:15.837
I guess.

56:15.905 --> 56:17.706
Davis, I need to
talk to you outside.

56:40.563 --> 56:42.831
You didn't even know him.

56:42.898 --> 56:46.802
I know. That's what makes
this so fucking sad.

56:50.806 --> 56:52.907
I know you have to go now,

56:52.974 --> 56:57.146
but please promise me this
isn't the last time I see you.

56:58.847 --> 57:00.182
Of course.

57:02.184 --> 57:05.188
Now, maybe this could...
This could work.

57:15.030 --> 57:17.433
We're going to the funeral.

57:20.835 --> 57:23.806
No. Absolutely not.

57:24.907 --> 57:26.675
What?

57:26.742 --> 57:29.545
If they wanted me there,
I'd have gotten a call.

57:29.612 --> 57:31.146
Yeah, but
he's your dad too.

57:31.213 --> 57:33.216
I am not going
to his house.

57:36.918 --> 57:39.254
You wouldn't have
to go to Ronald's,

57:39.322 --> 57:41.257
if that makes
a difference.

57:41.324 --> 57:45.094
They're burying him at the family
cabin in the mountains tonight.

57:45.161 --> 57:47.762
Just a quiet little thing
with Ronald and Marsha.

57:47.829 --> 57:50.732
You owe us this because you never
let us meet our grandfather.

57:50.800 --> 57:53.102
I mean, the least you can
do is let us say good-bye.

57:54.869 --> 57:56.472
She's right.

59:12.715 --> 59:15.084
They're running late.

59:15.150 --> 59:16.853
The body won't be here
until the morning.

59:18.219 --> 59:20.021
It's a good thing
he's dead.

59:20.088 --> 59:22.659
It'd kill him to know
he was late to something.

59:26.128 --> 59:29.030
There's a motel at the
base of the mountain...

59:29.097 --> 59:31.132
by the gas station.

59:31.199 --> 59:33.802
I think we'll stay the night
here, if that's okay with you.

59:37.472 --> 59:39.275
Plenty of room, right?

59:46.782 --> 59:49.251
Good. So we'll stay.

59:49.318 --> 59:51.153
And I'll help with the body
in the morning.

59:57.226 --> 59:59.662
Suit yourself. You can
stay in the basement.

01:00:05.034 --> 01:00:06.902
Yeah, I'm hungry too.

01:00:06.969 --> 01:00:09.438
Why don't you get those
little crackers from the car?

01:00:09.505 --> 01:00:11.373
Dad! He's making
everyone dinner.

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:15.309
Well, if it's good,
maybe it's worth waiting for,

01:00:18.246 --> 01:00:21.916
come join us.

01:00:27.155 --> 01:00:28.824
We're drinking
your wine, so...

01:00:38.501 --> 01:00:40.469
Can you
cut those up smaller?

01:00:40.536 --> 01:00:42.804
Yeah, sure.

01:00:42.871 --> 01:00:44.338
Quickly, sweetie.

01:00:44.405 --> 01:00:46.208
Fine. I'm not as good
at this as you are.

01:00:46.275 --> 01:00:47.527
Fine. I'll do it.

01:00:47.528 --> 01:00:48.778
I can do it.

01:00:54.016 --> 01:00:55.684
Hey, are you doin' okay?

01:01:06.362 --> 01:01:08.697
I'm sorry for how
I behaved last week.

01:01:11.032 --> 01:01:13.235
But I think that
these last few days...

01:01:13.302 --> 01:01:15.838
have been really good for me.

01:01:15.905 --> 01:01:18.006
How about you?

01:01:18.072 --> 01:01:20.408
Hey, anyone want some wine?

01:01:20.476 --> 01:01:22.945
Maybe after I'm done.

01:01:23.012 --> 01:01:24.814
It'll make it all go smoother.

01:01:26.282 --> 01:01:29.085
And I'll come back and help
you cut stuff as well.

01:01:30.585 --> 01:01:32.221
Thanks.

01:01:32.288 --> 01:01:34.056
Can I
have some too?

01:01:34.123 --> 01:01:36.793
Yeah, sure.

01:01:45.333 --> 01:01:47.034
This is a cool house.

01:01:47.101 --> 01:01:48.403
I'm glad you like it.

01:01:52.407 --> 01:01:54.143
Dinner's almost ready.

01:01:54.210 --> 01:01:55.811
Good.

01:02:02.016 --> 01:02:03.418
Want to sit down?

01:02:06.956 --> 01:02:09.125
If not, we can make
you a to-go plate.

01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:14.328
Ronnie, I'm kidding,
please.

01:02:14.396 --> 01:02:16.999
We should be able
to handle this.

01:02:39.889 --> 01:02:41.323
Do you want
some wine?

01:02:41.389 --> 01:02:44.025
Don't bother.
He doesn't like wine.

01:02:49.130 --> 01:02:51.533
I'll get him
his drink.

01:03:07.016 --> 01:03:10.085
Do you need help
with something?

01:03:10.152 --> 01:03:12.054
Just some Red Label.

01:03:13.621 --> 01:03:16.424
-He's down there?
-Yeah.

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:21.163
How'd you pull that off?

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:24.298
It's easy to despise someone
from a distance.

01:03:24.365 --> 01:03:26.367
Put them across a table,
though,

01:03:26.434 --> 01:03:29.204
most men won't pursue a
conflict if they can help it.

01:03:31.139 --> 01:03:33.809
Your dad's
a great example.

01:03:35.010 --> 01:03:36.345
Of what?

01:03:37.713 --> 01:03:39.282
A coward.

01:03:53.628 --> 01:03:55.130
That's your drink, right?

01:04:13.414 --> 01:04:15.217
Good memory.

01:04:17.452 --> 01:04:19.889
So, who's gonna
lose it tonight?

01:04:21.056 --> 01:04:22.391
You are.

01:04:23.992 --> 01:04:27.163
No, not me.

01:04:30.065 --> 01:04:32.134
What are you guys
talking about?

01:04:33.434 --> 01:04:35.003
May I?

01:04:42.411 --> 01:04:45.113
Ronnie and I spent every
summer here growing up.

01:04:45.179 --> 01:04:47.181
One summer,
we were alone,

01:04:47.248 --> 01:04:49.985
so every weekend was 48
hours straight of drinking.

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:54.056
Every few weekends
we'd wake up to see...

01:04:54.123 --> 01:04:56.490
that someone had
vomited somewhere.

01:04:56.557 --> 01:04:58.626
I'd accuse Ronnie of not being
able to hold his liquor.

01:04:58.693 --> 01:05:01.195
He'd accuse me.

01:05:01.262 --> 01:05:04.032
But neither of us
could remember.

01:05:05.733 --> 01:05:09.971
Ronnie, being the prankster he
was, suggested an experiment.

01:05:10.039 --> 01:05:11.573
We ate pasta for dinner.

01:05:11.639 --> 01:05:14.408
I had marinara,
he had Alfredo.

01:05:14.476 --> 01:05:17.311
Josh, if you're gonna
tell it, tell it right.

01:05:17.378 --> 01:05:20.482
I had marinara
and you had Alfredo.

01:05:21.717 --> 01:05:24.485
We threw the biggest party
of the summer.

01:05:24.552 --> 01:05:29.324
And we probably drank a little
bit more than we should've.

01:05:29.391 --> 01:05:32.059
So in the morning,

01:05:32.126 --> 01:05:33.762
the vomit...

01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:38.000
was either red or white.

01:05:38.067 --> 01:05:40.469
And then we'd know
whose it was.

01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:48.477
So...

01:05:48.543 --> 01:05:50.346
what color was it?

01:05:53.215 --> 01:05:55.518
It was pink.

01:06:01.789 --> 01:06:03.759
What's so funny?

01:06:03.826 --> 01:06:06.193
Why did you tell that story?

01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:08.730
I still think
it was you.

01:06:17.572 --> 01:06:19.340
Did I hear them laughing
down there?

01:06:19.407 --> 01:06:21.108
Yeah, look
what we've done.

01:06:21.175 --> 01:06:23.277
Well, it's still early.

01:06:23.344 --> 01:06:25.379
So, we should
get them all drunk.

01:06:25.447 --> 01:06:27.215
How much have you had?

01:06:27.282 --> 01:06:28.682
Just a little bit.

01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:31.719
Babe, the table is set.

01:06:31.786 --> 01:06:34.321
Family meeting.
Do not disturb.

01:06:34.389 --> 01:06:36.724
What?

01:06:36.791 --> 01:06:39.393
Sorry.
What I meant to say is,...

01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:41.396
Go away.

01:06:50.405 --> 01:06:53.175
Alexis, you may never
speak like that...

01:06:53.242 --> 01:06:55.110
to my girlfriend.

01:06:55.177 --> 01:06:57.144
-What did I...
-Do you understand?

01:06:58.780 --> 01:07:00.449
Why are you
being so mean?

01:07:00.516 --> 01:07:02.550
Because you're acting
like a little fucking girl.

01:07:04.585 --> 01:07:06.688
You treat me so
differently around her.

01:07:08.690 --> 01:07:11.126
Look, I know
that what happened...

01:07:11.193 --> 01:07:13.829
was really, really
fucked up, okay?

01:07:13.896 --> 01:07:15.331
No, it wasn't.

01:07:15.332 --> 01:07:16.765
Yes!

01:07:16.831 --> 01:07:19.166
Yes, it was.

01:07:19.233 --> 01:07:21.402
And we'll deal with it,
okay?

01:07:21.469 --> 01:07:22.870
I promise.
We will, later.

01:07:22.938 --> 01:07:24.739
But the way
that you're acting now,

01:07:24.806 --> 01:07:26.708
you're making me
regret all this.

01:07:26.775 --> 01:07:30.278
Coming here and meeting
you... everything.

01:07:33.614 --> 01:07:35.150
Look...

01:07:37.219 --> 01:07:40.356
Jesus fucking Christ,
Alexis!

01:07:41.690 --> 01:07:45.728
What are you gonna do?
Tell on me?

01:07:48.396 --> 01:07:51.500
It's all so fun
because they're right there.

01:07:51.567 --> 01:07:54.168
We're done,
you understand me?

01:07:54.235 --> 01:07:56.304
You'll never see me again
after tomorrow.

01:08:11.519 --> 01:08:12.855
Let's eat.

01:10:49.043 --> 01:10:51.012
It's good.

01:11:21.842 --> 01:11:23.778
Alexis,
where did you get that?

01:11:31.787 --> 01:11:33.887
You know where I got it.

01:11:33.954 --> 01:11:36.623
May I see that, please?

01:11:36.690 --> 01:11:38.594
Sweetie, take that off
and hand it to me now.

01:11:43.899 --> 01:11:45.100
Now!

01:11:45.167 --> 01:11:47.836
What else have ya got,
Josh?

01:11:47.903 --> 01:11:49.771
I didn't think you'd want
any of her stuff.

01:11:49.837 --> 01:11:51.672
At the end, you wanted
nothing to do with Rebecca.

01:11:51.739 --> 01:11:53.608
Don't you dare
mention her name.

01:11:53.675 --> 01:11:55.543
And you shouldn't
assume anything.

01:11:55.609 --> 01:11:58.078
Let's see if I'm in the will,
then maybe we can negotiate.

01:11:58.145 --> 01:11:59.514
That's the reason
why you're here.

01:11:59.581 --> 01:12:02.384
Well, what if it is? What are
you gonna do, disown me again?

01:12:02.451 --> 01:12:03.984
-I know it's your hobby.
-Give that to me.

01:12:04.051 --> 01:12:05.953
-Give it to me!
-Ronnie, no.

01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:07.688
-Alexis, come over here.
-Give it to me.

01:12:07.756 --> 01:12:10.158
-Give that to me!
-Alexis, give it to me.

01:12:10.225 --> 01:12:13.027
Let's bring it upstairs, then we can all
figure out what we want to do with it.

01:12:13.094 --> 01:12:15.563
-Please...
-Shut up, Cassie!

01:12:15.630 --> 01:12:18.166
This is not your family.
You need to fucking leave!

01:12:18.233 --> 01:12:20.436
Why? So you can have your
cousin all to yourself?

01:12:28.743 --> 01:12:31.179
What was that?

01:12:31.246 --> 01:12:33.648
I saw you two upstairs. There's
obviously something going on.

01:12:33.715 --> 01:12:36.385
What? Th-That's not true!

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:40.022
Cassie, that's not true.

01:12:47.628 --> 01:12:49.096
What is going on here,
Josh?

01:12:49.163 --> 01:12:51.500
I don't know.
Don't look at me.

01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:54.202
All of you.

01:12:54.269 --> 01:12:56.570
<i>You, you!</i>

01:12:56.637 --> 01:12:58.573
Stay away from my son!

01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:01.075
There's something wrong with you, Josh.
You're sick.

01:13:01.141 --> 01:13:02.710
And you passed it along
to your kids.

01:13:02.777 --> 01:13:04.112
Don't you dare!

01:13:04.179 --> 01:13:05.913
You fucking pervert!

01:13:07.215 --> 01:13:08.684
You took advantage of her,
Josh.

01:13:10.618 --> 01:13:11.987
You took advantage of her.

01:13:12.054 --> 01:13:15.856
You killed Rebecca and you know
goddamn well that you did!

01:13:17.859 --> 01:13:19.795
Stop it!

01:13:21.061 --> 01:13:22.663
No!

01:13:22.730 --> 01:13:24.666
Stop! Stop it!

01:13:28.703 --> 01:13:29.938
Get off, get off him!

01:13:31.605 --> 01:13:34.908
Davis! Davis!
Davis! Davis!

01:13:34.975 --> 01:13:36.110
Stop it!

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:41.181
Mind your business,
you jealous cunt!

01:13:41.248 --> 01:13:43.550
Why the fuck should I
be jealous of you?

01:13:43.618 --> 01:13:45.987
Because Davis hasn't been able to keep
his eyes off me since he got here.

01:13:46.054 --> 01:13:48.122
And I think he's happy
you had that abortion...

01:13:48.189 --> 01:13:50.993
so that he doesn't
have to be stuck with you.

01:13:55.764 --> 01:13:58.434
And in case you haven't realized,
your boyfriend and I...

01:14:22.657 --> 01:14:24.560
Alexis.

01:15:27.921 --> 01:15:31.192
You know, my dad hired people who
are coming to take care of that.

01:15:31.259 --> 01:15:33.060
Couldn't sleep.

01:15:33.127 --> 01:15:35.229
Thought I'd help us
get out of here faster.

01:15:36.997 --> 01:15:39.067
You seen Cassie?

01:15:39.134 --> 01:15:41.735
She took off, man.
Real early.

01:15:41.802 --> 01:15:44.805
I asked if she'd be back.
She said "no."

01:15:46.073 --> 01:15:47.942
How's your face?

01:15:50.377 --> 01:15:53.180
We should see your dad
before we declare a winner.

01:15:55.750 --> 01:15:58.020
So are you
a murderer, Josh?

01:15:59.220 --> 01:16:01.923
If I am,
then your dad is too.

01:16:01.989 --> 01:16:03.559
What did you do?

01:16:05.193 --> 01:16:07.128
I need some help.

01:16:08.095 --> 01:16:09.797
Come here.

01:16:22.042 --> 01:16:24.411
You know, you and I are more
alike than you might think.

01:16:24.479 --> 01:16:26.914
How's that?

01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:29.783
Well, your dad's a man of
careful words and thoughts.

01:16:29.850 --> 01:16:33.086
But when I saw you punch
Alexis, it clicked.

01:16:33.154 --> 01:16:34.889
I don't follow.

01:16:34.956 --> 01:16:37.792
If you'd thought about it,
you would've never done it.

01:16:37.859 --> 01:16:39.961
But you did.

01:16:40.028 --> 01:16:43.131
There are lots of things that
are out of our control, Davis.

01:16:43.198 --> 01:16:46.768
Almost everything is,
actually.

01:16:46.835 --> 01:16:48.136
So you stole
his girl?

01:16:49.369 --> 01:16:52.239
This... Rebecca.

01:16:52.306 --> 01:16:54.742
And he never
forgave you.

01:17:10.992 --> 01:17:13.628
Rebecca was our sister.

01:17:20.201 --> 01:17:24.005
Your dad found out about us
and he told the entire family.

01:17:24.072 --> 01:17:26.173
They shunned us
and it ruined her life.

01:17:27.341 --> 01:17:29.777
He shamed her
into killing herself.

01:17:32.846 --> 01:17:36.784
Come on, Davis. From what we heard last
night, are you in any place to judge?

01:17:38.987 --> 01:17:41.722
I know how you
feel about her.

01:17:41.789 --> 01:17:45.359
Your dad will never
forgive you for it.

01:17:47.028 --> 01:17:48.797
But I will.

01:19:37.404 --> 01:19:39.539
Davis,

01:19:39.606 --> 01:19:41.208
I was thinking.

01:19:42.643 --> 01:19:46.847
Maybe I could take your car
back and you could ride with...

01:20:11.538 --> 01:20:15.076
We don't have to ever
talk about this again.

01:20:20.515 --> 01:20:22.484
We can talk about it.

01:20:24.953 --> 01:20:28.656
That girl, your cousin,

01:20:28.722 --> 01:20:31.193
she's just
like my brother.

01:20:32.726 --> 01:20:34.427
How's that?

01:20:34.494 --> 01:20:36.597
Dangerous.

01:20:39.333 --> 01:20:42.336
Your behavior,

01:20:42.403 --> 01:20:45.306
your feelings for her,

01:20:45.372 --> 01:20:47.507
it's curiosity,
it's... it's...

01:20:47.574 --> 01:20:50.478
From not having known her.

01:20:50.545 --> 01:20:52.046
It's not...

01:20:52.047 --> 01:20:53.547
Dad...

01:20:53.613 --> 01:20:54.932
You know.

01:20:54.933 --> 01:20:56.250
Please.

01:21:04.057 --> 01:21:05.860
I'm sorry.

01:21:15.636 --> 01:21:17.939
For what?

01:21:21.475 --> 01:21:23.878
For everything.

01:21:27.381 --> 01:21:28.616
I guess I thought that...

01:21:30.585 --> 01:21:32.921
getting our families together
would've been a good thing.

01:21:34.788 --> 01:21:37.125
And what do you think now?

01:21:42.662 --> 01:21:45.599
I think they're assholes.

01:22:00.648 --> 01:22:04.185
<i>-Hi, this is Cassie.
-Leave a message.</i>

01:22:04.252 --> 01:22:07.188
Hey, Cass, it's me.

01:22:07.255 --> 01:22:09.757
I'm back in town,
staying at Todd's,

01:22:09.823 --> 01:22:15.362
so you know where to find me
whenever you want to talk.

01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:16.932
Okay. Bye.

01:22:24.471 --> 01:22:26.673
Hey, chef, there's a girl out
back who's here to see you.

01:22:26.740 --> 01:22:28.208
What?

01:22:28.275 --> 01:22:31.313
I don't know. She says it's important.
She needs to talk to you.

01:23:33.507 --> 01:23:35.042
Hi.

01:23:40.515 --> 01:23:44.385
I-I drove past your
apartment a few times.

01:23:44.452 --> 01:23:47.088
I saw you weren't there.

01:23:47.154 --> 01:23:50.425
I'm not living there
at the moment.

01:23:54.628 --> 01:23:56.430
Did you guys break up?

01:24:06.173 --> 01:24:08.309
Do you wanna take a walk?

01:24:20.787 --> 01:24:22.522
Can you say something,
please?

01:24:22.590 --> 01:24:25.493
You're making me
really self-conscious.

01:24:26.793 --> 01:24:28.895
Come on.

01:24:28.962 --> 01:24:31.065
Let's get you home.

01:24:38.573 --> 01:24:40.375
Come on.

01:24:53.621 --> 01:24:56.623
Can I come visit you
sometime?

01:24:58.259 --> 01:25:00.194
You just did.

01:25:17.578 --> 01:25:20.782
Davis, I could tell her
what happened between us.

01:25:24.518 --> 01:25:26.654
What we did.

01:25:38.666 --> 01:25:41.467
I love you.

01:25:41.534 --> 01:25:43.537
More than just family.
I...

01:25:46.673 --> 01:25:48.743
I love you.

01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:35.489
What do we do
about this?

01:26:40.027 --> 01:26:41.762
Nothing.

01:27:45.993 --> 01:27:48.396
Are you sure
you want me to do this?

01:27:54.734 --> 01:27:58.839
And if I do,
that's it?

01:28:00.975 --> 01:28:03.110
Game on?

01:28:03.176 --> 01:28:05.279
You promise?

01:28:08.882 --> 01:28:14.654
Even if you don't like
some of what you hear?

01:28:14.721 --> 01:28:16.056
I told you...

01:28:17.757 --> 01:28:19.460
It's not about
whether I like the answers.

01:28:19.527 --> 01:28:22.363
It's that
I get to know them.

01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:24.431
I get to know everything...

01:28:24.497 --> 01:28:26.600
from now on.

01:28:28.536 --> 01:28:30.404
Are you
pussying out?

01:28:32.206 --> 01:28:33.608
No.

01:28:36.010 --> 01:28:38.779
Okay.

01:28:38.845 --> 01:28:41.315
We'll start easy.

01:28:43.016 --> 01:28:45.720
Are you sexually attracted
to her?

01:28:49.489 --> 01:28:51.858
One lie,
this game is done.

01:28:55.496 --> 01:28:57.465
Are you sexually attracted
to your cousin?

01:29:01.135 --> 01:29:03.104
Yes.

01:29:08.141 --> 01:29:12.045
Have you thought about
what it would be like...

01:29:12.112 --> 01:29:13.980
to sleep with her?

01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:22.689
A lot?

01:29:27.795 --> 01:29:30.130
Okay.

01:29:30.197 --> 01:29:32.500
That one stung a bit.

01:29:37.003 --> 01:29:39.006
Is it more
than physical attraction?

01:29:46.814 --> 01:29:48.149
Maybe?

01:29:55.588 --> 01:29:57.024
I guess so, yeah.

01:30:02.729 --> 01:30:04.564
Do you think you'd make
a good couple?

01:30:06.833 --> 01:30:08.769
No.

01:30:11.738 --> 01:30:15.975
Given the chance, if there
were no consequences,

01:30:16.042 --> 01:30:17.944
would you do anything
with her?

01:30:23.149 --> 01:30:25.152
At one point...

01:30:26.319 --> 01:30:29.990
I guess so, yeah.

01:30:33.627 --> 01:30:36.798
But now, no.
No way.

01:30:38.666 --> 01:30:41.134
-Are you sure you want to be with me?
-Yes.

01:30:41.201 --> 01:30:44.005
-You have no doubts?
-No.

01:30:48.708 --> 01:30:52.646
Okay. Last question.

01:31:02.256 --> 01:31:06.026
Did you actually...

01:31:06.092 --> 01:31:09.029
do anything at all
with her?

01:31:14.868 --> 01:31:16.537
No.

01:31:18.905 --> 01:31:21.042
No.

01:31:22.009 --> 01:31:23.944
Nothing.

01:31:48.202 --> 01:31:50.137
Okay.

01:31:54.875 --> 01:31:57.645
Unpack your shit.
