00:05.804 --> 00:07.471
How do you get information

00:07.506 --> 00:10.108
from someone who wants
to keep it from you?

00:10.141 --> 00:12.512
Somewhere locked
inside their brain

00:12.544 --> 00:14.413
could be the truth about a crime

00:14.446 --> 00:17.149
or the plan
for a terrorist attack

00:17.182 --> 00:18.818
or the password
to a bank account

00:18.850 --> 00:21.286
or nuclear codes.

00:21.320 --> 00:22.455
To get information,

00:22.487 --> 00:24.724
we often resort to violence,

00:26.792 --> 00:28.294
but that often doesn't work

00:28.327 --> 00:31.330
and can cause a person
to close off even more.

00:31.362 --> 00:33.365
But that's not to say
there aren't other ways

00:33.399 --> 00:34.834
of getting people to talk

00:34.866 --> 00:37.269
or even of getting their brains

00:37.302 --> 00:39.171
to talk for them.

00:39.204 --> 00:41.173
In this episode,
I'm going to be injected

00:41.207 --> 00:42.575
with a truth serum.

00:42.607 --> 00:46.244
I'm going to coerce people
into giving false confessions,

00:46.277 --> 00:48.814
and I'm going to try
to hide the truth

00:48.847 --> 00:51.183
from a mind-reading machine.

00:51.216 --> 00:52.851
What's the best way
to get the truth

00:52.884 --> 00:55.387
or detect a lie?

00:55.420 --> 00:57.522
Let's see if anybody
can dig out the secrets

00:57.555 --> 01:00.426
I've got locked up in my head.

01:26.852 --> 01:29.722
It's a classic scene
in spy movies.

01:29.755 --> 01:32.758
Someone captures someone
they want information from,

01:32.790 --> 01:34.659
they inject them
with truth serum,

01:34.692 --> 01:36.394
and the person spills

01:36.427 --> 01:37.896
all their secrets.

01:37.930 --> 01:40.565
The serum used in almost
all of these movies

01:40.599 --> 01:42.100
is Sodium Pentothal,

01:42.133 --> 01:43.501
which is an actual drug

01:43.534 --> 01:44.969
that inhibits brain activity.

01:45.002 --> 01:47.840
It was first used
as a painkiller,

01:47.873 --> 01:51.443
<i>but was found to work better
as an anti-anxiety drug.</i>

01:51.477 --> 01:53.011
<i>It dulls your thoughts,</i>

01:53.044 --> 01:55.781
<i>making it harder
to perform cognitive tasks,</i>

01:55.814 --> 01:59.552
<i>including the task
of making up a lie.</i>

01:59.585 --> 02:01.087
The use of truth serums

02:01.120 --> 02:03.588
began in 1915

02:03.621 --> 02:06.492
when Dr. Robert House,
a physician in Texas,

02:06.525 --> 02:08.560
realized that scopolamine,

02:08.594 --> 02:10.729
a drug given to women
during childbirth,

02:10.762 --> 02:13.565
<i>had the effect
of getting them to talk</i>

02:13.599 --> 02:15.133
<i>without reservation.</i>

02:15.167 --> 02:16.902
Another drug, midazolam,

02:16.935 --> 02:19.572
has been used to treat
Iraq War burn victims

02:19.605 --> 02:21.806
who suffer from PTSD.

02:21.839 --> 02:24.609
Midazolam helps reduce
their inhibitions,

02:24.643 --> 02:26.479
allowing them
to talk more freely

02:26.512 --> 02:28.581
about their experiences.

02:28.613 --> 02:31.015
Midazolam is also
one of the drugs used

02:31.048 --> 02:32.718
<i>in lethal injections,</i>

02:32.750 --> 02:35.754
<i>including several
botched executions.</i>

02:35.787 --> 02:38.757
I arranged to be injected
with midazolam

02:38.791 --> 02:42.161
to see if it could make me
spill my guts.

02:47.865 --> 02:50.568
This is the midazolam,

02:50.601 --> 02:52.837
the medicine
we are going to use.

02:52.870 --> 02:54.873
This is enough
to put an elephant to sleep.

02:54.906 --> 02:57.709
So we'll have to make it
very, very, very dilute

02:57.743 --> 02:59.053
and then give you
very, very small amount

02:59.077 --> 03:00.913
of the diluted drug.
- Please, yes.

03:00.946 --> 03:02.715
- You will be
comfortable and happy.

03:02.748 --> 03:04.784
It's euphoric.
You will feel very cool.

03:04.816 --> 03:08.921
- But I also wanna
keep some secrets.

03:08.953 --> 03:10.722
- That is...

03:10.756 --> 03:12.725
It remains to be determined.

03:12.757 --> 03:15.894
Okay. Michael, um, we'll
introduce you to Dr. Pavlo.

03:15.928 --> 03:17.663
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

03:17.696 --> 03:19.532
How are you doing?

03:19.565 --> 03:21.643
- Good.
<i>-  Dr. Pavlo is a police psychologist</i>

03:21.667 --> 03:23.068
<i>and an expert in interrogations.</i>

03:23.101 --> 03:24.678
Have you started the drip yet?

03:24.702 --> 03:26.504
We would like to start

03:26.537 --> 03:29.808
with the amount
of one, milligram.

03:29.841 --> 03:32.043
<i> Dr. Pavlo's objective
was to get me to admit</i>

03:32.077 --> 03:33.645
<i>to certain information,</i>

03:33.679 --> 03:35.548
<i>one, that my sister's name
is Melissa</i>

03:35.581 --> 03:37.715
<i>and, two, that my job is hosting</i>

03:37.749 --> 03:39.651
Mind Field <i> and</i> Vsauce.

03:39.685 --> 03:42.555
<i>My objective...
Not to admit the truth.</i>

03:42.588 --> 03:44.889
Are you feeling
more relaxed in your body?

03:44.923 --> 03:47.226
- I'm feeling warm all over.

03:47.258 --> 03:50.029
It's amazing how quickly
this came into effect.

03:50.061 --> 03:51.873
- Let me just ask you
a couple of basic questions.

03:51.897 --> 03:53.666
- I'd love to.
- Okay.

03:53.698 --> 03:55.100
Where are you?

03:55.132 --> 03:57.469
What town? What city?
- Pasadena.

03:57.502 --> 03:59.171
- How old are you?

03:59.203 --> 04:01.673
- Thirty-one.
- Do you have any siblings?

04:01.707 --> 04:02.740
- Yeah.

04:02.774 --> 04:04.977
How old is your sister, Melissa?

04:08.881 --> 04:10.549
That... That's not her name.

04:10.582 --> 04:12.618
- Um...
- What do you do for a living?

04:12.650 --> 04:14.252
- I am a choreographer by trade.

04:14.286 --> 04:15.662
Um...
- What might be something

04:15.686 --> 04:17.690
I'm familiar with that you did?

04:17.723 --> 04:20.593
- Have you heard
of, um,<i> The Lion King?</i>

04:20.625 --> 04:22.060
- Yes.
- On Broadway?

04:22.094 --> 04:22.762
- I have.

04:22.795 --> 04:24.263
I think he needs an extra dose.

04:24.296 --> 04:26.130
Absolutely.

04:26.163 --> 04:29.601
- That means I got them right.
- You are too sharp.

04:29.635 --> 04:31.570
How much
have I had total so far?

04:31.603 --> 04:32.905
- Two milligrams.

04:34.606 --> 04:36.108
Question for you.

04:36.140 --> 04:37.609
How do you feel now?

04:37.642 --> 04:39.811
I feel like in order
to feel like this,

04:39.844 --> 04:42.614
I would have had to have had...

04:42.647 --> 04:44.115
six drinks.

04:44.149 --> 04:46.151
Tell me about <i> Mind Field.</i>

04:46.183 --> 04:48.286
- Mine field?
- Yeah.

04:50.788 --> 04:52.058
- Mine field?

04:53.257 --> 04:55.728
They're...
They're terrible.

04:55.760 --> 04:58.062
There are places
that we've got mines

04:58.096 --> 05:01.233
still littered throughout
the, um, the land,

05:01.265 --> 05:02.734
Cambodia, Vietnam.

05:02.767 --> 05:05.103
- You know, I think
you misinterpreted my question.

05:05.137 --> 05:08.774
YouTube show <i> Mind Field</i>
that you host.

05:08.807 --> 05:10.042
Tell me about that.
Scientific?

05:10.075 --> 05:12.243
- I am somewhat familiar with it.

05:12.276 --> 05:14.880
Can he get another dose?

05:14.913 --> 05:18.050
Okay. We're just gonna
get you even more relaxed.

05:20.719 --> 05:22.788
Tell me your occupation.

05:22.820 --> 05:24.789
- I'm a choreographer.

05:24.822 --> 05:26.058
- Any siblings?

05:26.091 --> 05:28.727
- I have a sibling
in, Colorado.

05:28.760 --> 05:29.971
What's your favorite food?

05:29.995 --> 05:32.565
- Rotisserie,

05:32.598 --> 05:34.667
Greek doner.

05:34.700 --> 05:36.601
- Does your sister Melissa
like that, too?

05:36.635 --> 05:38.736
- She'll eat the meat by itself.

05:39.971 --> 05:41.306
<i>Trying to get Michael to admit</i>

05:41.339 --> 05:44.108
that he has a sister,
Melissa, was no easy feat.

05:44.142 --> 05:46.911
<i>Luckily,
he was anesthetized enough</i>

05:46.945 --> 05:48.913
and did admit that
he has a sister, Melissa.

05:48.947 --> 05:51.684
You ever think about being
an uncle or a father yourself?

05:51.716 --> 05:52.952
Do you want children?

05:52.985 --> 05:54.954
- I would love
to have children, yeah.

05:54.986 --> 05:57.055
My... my wife and I are trying,

05:57.089 --> 06:00.692
but I'm always doing stuff
like this, you know.

06:00.726 --> 06:02.894
- Yeah, yeah.
- It's like, "Hey, honey,

06:02.928 --> 06:05.096
do you wanna make
a little, baby?"

06:05.130 --> 06:06.832
And I'm like,

06:06.865 --> 06:10.336
I got to go

06:10.368 --> 06:11.703
get interrogated

06:11.736 --> 06:14.873
and pumped full of midazolam.

06:14.906 --> 06:16.240
Are you gonna give him anymore?

06:16.274 --> 06:19.845
- Yeah, because I...
He's not sedated enough.

06:19.877 --> 06:21.647
I could do another one.

06:21.680 --> 06:23.757
- This would probably
the last dose I wanna give him.

06:23.781 --> 06:25.817
- Yes.
Do most people

06:25.851 --> 06:27.252
at this dose fall asleep?

06:27.284 --> 06:28.720
- Yeah.

06:33.991 --> 06:36.728
How you doing, Michael?

06:36.762 --> 06:38.230
- Good.

06:38.262 --> 06:40.264
- Feeling a little bit
more tired now?

06:40.298 --> 06:43.002
- Yeah, heavy.

06:43.034 --> 06:44.802
- And who's the president?

06:44.836 --> 06:48.007
- President P...
President Trump.

06:48.039 --> 06:49.283
President Trump. Where are we?

06:49.307 --> 06:50.709
What city are we in?

06:50.741 --> 06:52.410
- Yo, Pasadena.

06:52.444 --> 06:54.246
- Which show do you like
to do more,

06:54.279 --> 06:56.714
<i>Mind Field</i> or <i> Vsauce?</i>

06:56.748 --> 06:59.651
Which one do you enjoy more?

06:59.685 --> 07:00.853
- <i>Vsauce.</i>

07:00.885 --> 07:02.286
- <i>Vsauce?</i>

07:02.320 --> 07:04.123
- Yeah.
- Why?

07:04.156 --> 07:06.425
- Because they can be
whatever I want them to be,

07:06.457 --> 07:09.094
and there's no
executive in control.

07:09.127 --> 07:13.132
By the way, my eyes
were closed, weren't they?

07:13.164 --> 07:14.999
And I didn't realize

07:15.033 --> 07:18.904
that you were still a real
person asking me questions.

07:18.937 --> 07:22.141
I think had it
not have been for the drug,

07:22.173 --> 07:24.442
<i>there's no way he would
have admitted anything.</i>

07:24.476 --> 07:25.778
Before, you were pretending

07:25.810 --> 07:28.046
to be a choreographer,
weren't you?

07:28.079 --> 07:29.414
- No, it's the drugs,

07:29.447 --> 07:31.750
but I really am a choreographer.

07:31.783 --> 07:33.085
<i>After a few minutes,</i>

07:33.118 --> 07:34.687
<i>he got right back on track.</i>

07:34.719 --> 07:36.320
He's very strong-willed

07:36.353 --> 07:39.024
and really believes
in what he's doing

07:39.057 --> 07:41.427
and was able
to maintain the charade.

07:41.459 --> 07:42.861
Okay. You're done.

07:42.894 --> 07:44.030
How do you feel?

07:46.798 --> 07:48.434
I feel ready to drive.

07:48.466 --> 07:51.070
Just kidding.

07:51.103 --> 07:53.805
<i> While midazolam
lowered my inhibitions</i>

07:53.839 --> 07:55.149
<i>and my ability
to lie consistently,</i>

07:55.173 --> 07:57.209
<i>truth serums raise
ethical concerns</i>

07:57.241 --> 08:00.344
<i>about one's right
against self-incrimination.</i>

08:00.377 --> 08:02.413
<i>Furthermore, larger scale
studies have shown</i>

08:02.447 --> 08:04.083
<i>that truth serums
can cause people</i>

08:04.115 --> 08:06.818
<i>to reconstruct
and fabricate memories.</i>

08:06.851 --> 08:10.221
So, truth serums
are not very reliable,

08:10.255 --> 08:13.726
but what about the techniques
used by the police?

08:16.495 --> 08:17.863
I'm gonna tear you apart

08:17.896 --> 08:19.106
if you don't give us
some answers.

08:19.130 --> 08:22.101
- Michael,
let me take a shot at this.

08:22.134 --> 08:25.337
Look, we're all friends here.

08:25.370 --> 08:26.939
If I was in your shoes,

08:26.971 --> 08:28.272
I'd probably do the same thing.

08:28.305 --> 08:30.075
- You're being too easy
on this, scum.

08:30.108 --> 08:33.445
Your fingerprints are
all over the crime scene.

08:33.477 --> 08:34.813
You make me sick.

08:34.845 --> 08:38.381
- Michael,
if you get him too scared,

08:38.416 --> 08:39.484
he'll shut down.

08:39.517 --> 08:41.119
We only wanna scare him enough.

08:41.152 --> 08:42.421
- That's right.

08:42.453 --> 08:43.789
And after I do that,

08:43.821 --> 08:45.256
he's gonna give you relief,

08:45.290 --> 08:47.892
and then we'll do that
over and over and over again.

08:47.925 --> 08:50.128
You're gonna be taken on
an emotional roller coaster

08:50.161 --> 08:52.330
that will deplete the
finite cognitive resources

08:52.363 --> 08:54.833
you'll need to keep
withholding information.

08:54.866 --> 08:57.069
- All right.
I confess.

08:57.102 --> 08:58.470
It really does work.

08:58.502 --> 09:00.405
You see, at one moment,
I'm terrified

09:00.438 --> 09:01.506
but then I'm comforted.

09:01.539 --> 09:03.909
The constant shifting
from one emotion to another

09:03.941 --> 09:07.145
fogs my critical thinking
until I might confess to a crime

09:07.179 --> 09:08.547
I didn't even commit.

09:08.579 --> 09:12.984
It's called
the fear-then-relief response.

09:19.523 --> 09:22.160
The good cop/bad cop method
of interrogation

09:22.194 --> 09:25.464
evolved out of a psychological
manipulation procedure

09:25.497 --> 09:28.000
called the Reid technique,

09:28.032 --> 09:29.368
developed in the 1950s

09:29.401 --> 09:32.003
and used broadly
by police departments

09:32.036 --> 09:33.805
since the 1970s.

09:33.839 --> 09:35.541
Now, under the Reid technique,

09:35.574 --> 09:37.309
interrogators first assess

09:37.342 --> 09:40.312
whether a suspect
is withholding the truth.

09:40.344 --> 09:42.413
If they think
the suspect is lying,

09:42.446 --> 09:45.183
interrogators then move
to the second stage

09:45.217 --> 09:47.419
in which they seek a confession.

09:47.451 --> 09:49.187
Now, critics
of the Reid technique say

09:49.220 --> 09:52.356
that the first phase
isn't reliable enough,

09:52.390 --> 09:53.191
and that often,

09:53.224 --> 09:54.926
someone who is
completely innocent

09:54.959 --> 09:56.328
makes it to the second stage

09:56.360 --> 09:58.029
where it's assumed
they're guilty

09:58.063 --> 10:01.200
and police begin
seeking a confession.

10:01.233 --> 10:02.334
And they often get it.

10:02.367 --> 10:06.070
But why would anyone
falsely confess?

10:06.103 --> 10:08.272
Well, to find out,
I decided to learn

10:08.305 --> 10:10.575
how to make someone confess

10:10.608 --> 10:12.545
to a crime they didn't commit.

10:17.281 --> 10:20.886
<i> Dr. Melissa Russano
is an expert</i>

10:20.919 --> 10:23.222
<i>in investigative research,
including the process</i>

10:23.254 --> 10:25.923
<i>of interrogation and confession.</i>

10:25.956 --> 10:27.167
Tell me about false confessions

10:27.191 --> 10:29.060
and why people make them.

10:29.094 --> 10:31.128
- In a nutshell,
people confess to crimes

10:31.161 --> 10:33.364
that they didn't commit
because they come to believe

10:33.397 --> 10:35.437
that it's in their best interest
to falsely confess,

10:35.467 --> 10:37.069
and that's really
counterintuitive.

10:37.102 --> 10:38.971
- Right, because confessing

10:39.003 --> 10:40.938
is the worst thing to do, right?

10:40.972 --> 10:43.408
Like that's what you need
to avoid at all costs.

10:43.440 --> 10:45.944
- Yes, when you're not
in the situation

10:45.977 --> 10:49.248
of being convinced that
it's actually your best option.

10:49.281 --> 10:51.282
- But that's kind of
what I wanna do today.

10:51.315 --> 10:52.483
I wanna see how easy it is

10:52.517 --> 10:56.088
to get a false
confession from someone.

10:56.121 --> 10:57.389
How do I do that?

10:57.422 --> 10:59.523
<i> One way
is minimization techniques.</i>

10:59.556 --> 11:01.259
<i>You've got
to get them to believe</i>

11:01.292 --> 11:03.361
that their best option
out of this situation

11:03.395 --> 11:06.131
to make this end is to confess.

11:06.164 --> 11:07.407
You can say,
"Look, I really think

11:07.431 --> 11:08.943
it's in your
best interest to cooperate."

11:08.967 --> 11:10.636
There are
other techniques as well

11:10.669 --> 11:12.905
- <i>like maximization, right?
- </i> <i> Okay.</i>

11:12.938 --> 11:14.273
- <i>So they have to believe that</i>

11:14.305 --> 11:15.583
if they don't confess,
things are gonna be worse,

11:15.607 --> 11:18.343
um, that the punishment
will likely be more severe,

11:18.376 --> 11:21.346
and so their best option
in the moment is to...

11:21.378 --> 11:24.015
Is to confess to you.
One other technique

11:24.049 --> 11:25.317
<i>is befriending them,</i>

11:25.349 --> 11:26.661
<i>um, where you're
lulling the suspect</i>

11:26.685 --> 11:29.588
into a false sense of
security to trust you.

11:29.621 --> 11:31.256
- What about making a deal?

11:31.289 --> 11:33.158
- So police officers
are not allowed

11:33.190 --> 11:37.262
to, um, make explicit offers
of leniency or a deal.

11:37.295 --> 11:39.430
So you cannot make any promises,

11:39.464 --> 11:41.400
but you can say,
"Look, I really think

11:41.432 --> 11:43.267
it's in your best interest
to cooperate."

11:43.300 --> 11:44.545
You don't have
to explicitly say something

11:44.569 --> 11:46.471
for the message
to be communicated.

11:46.503 --> 11:48.306
<i>With all these tools in mind,</i>

11:48.339 --> 11:50.608
<i>I was ready to try to get
a false confession.</i>

11:53.545 --> 11:55.714
- All right.
<i>- Our subjects answered</i>

11:55.747 --> 11:59.184
<i>our online ad
offering $75</i>

11:59.217 --> 12:00.719
<i>to test a new logic exam</i>

12:00.752 --> 12:02.654
<i>for an educational institution.</i>

12:02.686 --> 12:05.456
<i>They didn't realize
that the institution was fake</i>

12:05.489 --> 12:07.291
<i>and the other participants
taking the test</i>

12:07.325 --> 12:10.027
<i>were actually actors
working for us.</i>

12:10.060 --> 12:11.738
It's a pretty
standard release form.

12:11.762 --> 12:14.465
<i> Before the test,
the participants were required</i>

12:14.498 --> 12:16.468
<i>to sign a document
stating that they would be</i>

12:16.501 --> 12:18.670
<i>under breach of contract
if they cheated on the test.</i>

12:18.703 --> 12:20.472
When you work
on the individual questions,

12:20.504 --> 12:23.674
it's very important
that you work alone.

12:23.708 --> 12:25.344
Don't talk about
what you're doing,

12:25.377 --> 12:26.344
don't share answers.

12:26.377 --> 12:29.046
Good luck.
See you soon.

12:29.079 --> 12:30.757
<i> The subjects didn't
know that there were several</i>

12:30.781 --> 12:33.218
<i>hidden cameras around
and that we were watching</i>

12:33.251 --> 12:35.754
<i>everything unfold
from another room.</i>

12:35.786 --> 12:38.422
<i>During the testing,
the participants and our actors</i>

12:38.455 --> 12:40.257
<i>did not share information.</i>

12:40.291 --> 12:42.661
<i>At no time
did cheating take place.</i>

12:42.694 --> 12:45.497
I'm gonna collect these
and put them in the database,

12:45.530 --> 12:47.407
and I'll be right back to start
the next phase, okay, guys?

12:47.431 --> 12:48.800
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

12:48.834 --> 12:51.770
<i> I wore an earpiece
so that Melissa could guide me</i>

12:51.802 --> 12:53.371
<i>during the entire process.</i>

12:53.405 --> 12:55.474
<i>A few minutes later, it was time</i>

12:55.507 --> 12:58.443
<i>to set up a false accusation.</i>

12:58.475 --> 13:00.578
So, we actually
might have a problem.

13:00.612 --> 13:03.482
Um, I'll need to speak
to each of you separately.

13:03.515 --> 13:05.158
So, James, could you
come with me just outside?

13:05.182 --> 13:06.517
- Sure.
- I'll take these now.

13:06.550 --> 13:09.021
Thank you.
And, um, Nicole,

13:09.054 --> 13:10.322
you can just wait right here?

13:10.354 --> 13:11.690
Awesome. Thank you.

13:16.427 --> 13:18.229
You got to give them
enough time to plausibly

13:18.262 --> 13:19.773
be talking to you.
- Believe that I'm talking to him.

13:19.797 --> 13:21.499
- And calling the director.

13:22.834 --> 13:24.803
- Hi, Nicole.
- Hello.

13:24.835 --> 13:28.406
- You and James both had

13:28.440 --> 13:29.674
the same wrong answer

13:29.706 --> 13:31.175
for the triangle problem.

13:31.209 --> 13:33.310
It looks to me like
there was information sharing.

13:33.344 --> 13:35.222
Like, you guys spoke
to one another about the answer

13:35.246 --> 13:37.682
on that problem?
- I didn't... I didn't do it.

13:37.714 --> 13:40.551
We didn't talk at all
on the individual problems.

13:40.584 --> 13:41.829
I kept my eyes on my paper
because I knew

13:41.853 --> 13:44.122
that would probably
throw off the results.

13:44.155 --> 13:46.491
- If I just write out here, like,

13:46.523 --> 13:52.464
"I admit
that I shared answers."

13:52.497 --> 13:54.266
I don't remember talking
to him at all about,

13:54.299 --> 13:56.435
like, while we're doing the individual...
- Okay.

13:56.468 --> 13:59.570
<i> First I tried to minimize
the consequences of confessing.</i>

13:59.603 --> 14:02.273
I really think
it's in your best interest.

14:02.306 --> 14:03.850
I really think it's
in your best interest

14:03.874 --> 14:07.211
to sign this stating
that you admit

14:07.244 --> 14:08.379
to sharing the information.

14:08.412 --> 14:11.416
I honestly believe
that that is...

14:11.449 --> 14:13.351
- But I did not...
Look, I don't know

14:13.383 --> 14:15.496
what's going on here. I
really... that's... I don't know.

14:15.520 --> 14:17.598
I came here to help.
- I understand what you're saying and...

14:17.622 --> 14:19.166
- And I never said,
like, "Hey, there's..."

14:19.190 --> 14:20.724
- Megan...
- Please let me finish,

14:20.757 --> 14:23.427
because I don't appreciate,
like, over-talking and stuff.

14:23.460 --> 14:25.863
<i> I was too aggressive
at first. I had a lot to learn.</i>

14:25.897 --> 14:28.432
<i>Next, I tried to maximize
the consequences</i>

14:28.465 --> 14:29.767
<i>of not confessing.</i>

14:29.800 --> 14:31.435
What we're looking at
is... is possible

14:31.469 --> 14:32.804
breach of contract here.

14:32.836 --> 14:34.438
If he comes down here,

14:34.472 --> 14:37.142
he's going to be
a lot more upset.

14:37.175 --> 14:40.178
If the director
has to come down here,

14:40.210 --> 14:41.254
he's gonna be even more upset

14:41.278 --> 14:42.713
and annoyed than he already is.

14:42.747 --> 14:44.248
- It did not happen.
- Okay.

14:44.281 --> 14:45.626
- And I... my...
I put that on my dad,

14:45.650 --> 14:47.586
and I have my dad
around my neck, so...

14:47.619 --> 14:49.235
<i>Once that was
me agains't her familiy</i>

14:49.260 --> 14:51.022
I lost my chance to get
a false confession.

14:51.055 --> 14:53.358
<i>I had to become
the suspect's friend.</i>

14:53.391 --> 14:55.827
I also understand

14:55.859 --> 14:58.363
you're a nice guy
and, like, sharing information

14:58.396 --> 15:00.132
or helping someone
with a problem

15:00.165 --> 15:01.233
is the nice thing to do.

15:01.266 --> 15:02.534
It's what we normally do.

15:02.566 --> 15:03.743
- But I didn't share
any information,

15:03.767 --> 15:05.704
so I can't sign that document.

15:05.737 --> 15:08.707
<i> But I failed to convince
this guy to be my friend.</i>

15:08.739 --> 15:11.509
<i>I struck out with all
of these test subjects.</i>

15:11.542 --> 15:13.177
<i>But after my failed attempts,</i>

15:13.210 --> 15:15.246
<i>I was ready to put
everything I had learned</i>

15:15.280 --> 15:17.214
<i>into my next encounter.</i>

15:17.248 --> 15:19.251
Is there a strategy
I should use?

15:19.283 --> 15:20.885
- I think that you should proceed

15:20.919 --> 15:23.488
with making sure that you're
not overly confrontational.

15:23.521 --> 15:25.323
- Yeah.
- And making sure that she

15:25.355 --> 15:28.325
sees you as someone who she
can trust your advice,

15:28.358 --> 15:29.894
and so I would...
I would proceed

15:29.927 --> 15:31.195
with that kind of approach.

15:31.228 --> 15:33.599
- Okay. I'm going in.

15:35.432 --> 15:36.800
Thanks for waiting.

15:36.834 --> 15:38.503
- No problem.
- So...

15:39.704 --> 15:41.772
I think we do have a problem.

15:41.805 --> 15:45.243
I was looking through
your individual questionnaires.

15:45.276 --> 15:48.380
And you guys both had

15:48.412 --> 15:50.781
the same wrong answer

15:50.815 --> 15:52.383
on the triangle problem.

15:52.416 --> 15:53.685
- Really?
- So, it was kind of

15:53.718 --> 15:56.421
this weird, like,
okay, what's going on?

15:56.454 --> 15:57.830
Like, statistically,
what are the chances

15:57.854 --> 15:59.423
that two people are gonna have

15:59.456 --> 16:01.425
these very unique answers?

16:02.660 --> 16:05.564
- So, I called
the project director

16:05.597 --> 16:08.300
to see what to do
because if, you know,

16:08.333 --> 16:10.267
this is a sign
that information were shared

16:10.300 --> 16:11.936
during the individual section,

16:11.969 --> 16:13.939
that's a major problem
for the study, right?

16:13.972 --> 16:15.774
We didn't look
at each other's stuff.

16:15.806 --> 16:18.776
That was like...
We were, like, on...

16:18.810 --> 16:21.279
Like, we didn't ask
each other anything,

16:21.311 --> 16:22.781
we didn't, like, you know...

16:22.814 --> 16:24.657
We didn't talk to each other
the whole entire time.

16:24.681 --> 16:27.252
So I don't know how
we got the same answer.

16:27.285 --> 16:29.654
But I'm, like, a hundred
percent sure that that was,

16:29.686 --> 16:31.822
like, the answer
that I came up with.

16:31.855 --> 16:34.258
<i> Deja was resolute
about her innocence,</i>

16:34.291 --> 16:37.395
<i>but I was about to maximize
the consequences of cheating</i>

16:37.428 --> 16:38.863
<i>should she not cooperate.</i>

16:38.896 --> 16:41.333
And that's a really big deal
because through this grant,

16:41.366 --> 16:42.810
we need to have
integrity of the data,

16:42.834 --> 16:44.935
we need to always obey
the rules of the experiment,

16:44.969 --> 16:46.680
and it could even be
a breach of the contract

16:46.704 --> 16:49.708
that you guys signed
when you came to do this study.

16:49.741 --> 16:50.750
- Okay.

16:50.775 --> 16:52.976
<i> Deja now knew what
was at stake</i>

16:53.044 --> 16:54.579
<i>My job was to convince her</i>

16:54.612 --> 16:56.581
<i>that I have her best interest
at heart.</i>

16:56.613 --> 16:58.382
I have to call
the director back, right?

16:58.416 --> 17:00.685
And I could either tell him
I don't know what's going on,

17:00.718 --> 17:02.487
we can't proceed, like,

17:02.520 --> 17:03.964
you need to come down here.

17:03.988 --> 17:06.290
- I don't know
who he's going to involve.

17:06.324 --> 17:08.667
The easier...
- I don't think any sharing was involved, though.

17:08.692 --> 17:11.363
- All I know is that I can't
explain what happened.

17:11.395 --> 17:13.030
- Okay.
- The easier option

17:13.064 --> 17:15.032
is to just document that,

17:15.065 --> 17:16.901
um, information was shared.

17:16.933 --> 17:19.738
Okay? So, if I write out,

17:19.770 --> 17:20.872
um, you know,

17:20.904 --> 17:24.375
"I admit

17:24.409 --> 17:28.345
that I shared,

17:28.378 --> 17:29.981
the answer..."

17:30.014 --> 17:32.950
- But we didn't.
- "to the triangle..."

17:32.984 --> 17:34.486
- Is that crazy to say

17:34.518 --> 17:37.055
that we didn't
share answers, though?

17:37.087 --> 17:38.355
Because I'm like,

17:38.389 --> 17:39.623
I don't know what he's saying

17:39.657 --> 17:41.926
or if he said that
he looked at my answer

17:41.959 --> 17:43.995
or... but we didn't.

17:44.027 --> 17:45.796
<i>Deja wasn't quite convinced.</i>

17:45.830 --> 17:47.966
<i>So the next tactic
was to minimize</i>

17:47.998 --> 17:49.767
<i>the impact of confessing.</i>

17:49.801 --> 17:51.536
I don't know
exactly how it happened.

17:51.568 --> 17:53.504
I just know that
we've got to figure out

17:53.537 --> 17:54.939
the best way forward.

17:54.971 --> 17:56.516
- This is so weird.
- I don't know exactly

17:56.540 --> 17:57.675
how it happened.

17:57.709 --> 17:59.544
It looks like
information sharing.

17:59.576 --> 18:01.880
If you just tell us that that happened...
- Say that?

18:01.912 --> 18:03.924
- Then what we can do is
I can call the director back

18:03.948 --> 18:06.517
and say that you guys
are cooperating

18:06.551 --> 18:09.087
and I know him.

18:09.120 --> 18:10.955
- That's the best thing.
- Okay.

18:10.988 --> 18:14.058
I mean, it's not true
but I'll sign it.

18:14.092 --> 18:16.026
- Okay. If you sign
and date it,

18:16.059 --> 18:17.394
I can go and call him back,

18:17.428 --> 18:18.997
and I'll try to get you
out of here.

18:19.029 --> 18:20.065
Okay.

18:20.097 --> 18:21.865
It's very weird,

18:21.899 --> 18:23.001
but...

18:24.369 --> 18:25.536
Okay.

18:30.141 --> 18:31.685
- Thank you very much, Deja.
- You're welcome.

18:31.709 --> 18:33.445
- I will be...
I'll be right back.

18:33.478 --> 18:34.521
- Okay.
- Thanks for your patience.

18:34.545 --> 18:36.047
- No problem.

18:41.853 --> 18:43.587
So you did an excellent job

18:43.621 --> 18:44.889
of communicating to her

18:44.921 --> 18:46.524
that it was
in her best interest,

18:46.556 --> 18:48.125
that the best way
out of this situation

18:48.159 --> 18:49.561
was to confess.

18:49.594 --> 18:51.062
- But it feels so bad.

18:51.094 --> 18:53.597
- Of course.
- I mean, she knows the seriousness.

18:53.631 --> 18:55.566
She knows that it's a lie.

18:56.867 --> 18:59.136
I mean, I didn't cheat.

18:59.170 --> 19:00.638
I did not cheat.

19:00.671 --> 19:03.575
Those were all my answers.

19:05.977 --> 19:08.446
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:08.478 --> 19:11.815
- Okay.
this concludes the study.

19:11.848 --> 19:13.617
I'm gonna give you
a debrief now,

19:13.651 --> 19:15.487
to tell you
about what we're studying.

19:15.519 --> 19:17.988
- Okay.
- So, first of all,

19:18.021 --> 19:19.089
you're not in trouble.

19:19.123 --> 19:20.892
Okay.

19:20.924 --> 19:22.826
The other guy here works for us.

19:22.860 --> 19:24.972
- Okay.
- This is not a study of logic problems,

19:24.996 --> 19:27.632
it's a study of interrogation

19:27.664 --> 19:29.466
and false confessions.

19:31.568 --> 19:32.770
Good one.

19:32.804 --> 19:34.139
- You falsely confessed today.

19:34.171 --> 19:36.007
- I see that.

19:36.039 --> 19:37.508
- How do you feel?

19:37.542 --> 19:39.043
- I feel mad at myself

19:39.075 --> 19:41.779
because I'm usually
the one who, like,

19:41.813 --> 19:43.648
you know, just...

19:43.680 --> 19:46.049
sticks to what,

19:46.083 --> 19:48.486
you know, what's right.
I try to, at least.

19:48.518 --> 19:49.554
- So, what happened today?

19:49.586 --> 19:51.155
- It was just scary, I guess,

19:51.189 --> 19:54.625
because it's an environment
I've never been in before

19:54.659 --> 19:57.429
and then just, like,
all the pressure.

19:57.461 --> 19:58.962
It was just like,

19:58.996 --> 20:01.533
"Well, I guess,
I should just sign it

20:01.565 --> 20:04.134
and say that I did it."

20:04.168 --> 20:06.070
<i> Despite knowing
she was innocent</i>

20:06.103 --> 20:08.605
<i>and knowing she was admitting
to breaching a contract,</i>

20:08.639 --> 20:11.810
<i>Deja signed a confession
that in a true criminal case</i>

20:11.843 --> 20:14.813
<i>could be used as evidence
in a trial against her.</i>

20:14.845 --> 20:17.882
Imagine if
there were consequences

20:17.914 --> 20:20.551
and this was a real crime...

20:20.584 --> 20:22.554
- How easy it is
to get someone to confess

20:22.586 --> 20:26.089
to something without
even punching them

20:26.123 --> 20:27.225
or waterboarding them,

20:27.257 --> 20:28.692
just being nice
and tell them that

20:28.726 --> 20:29.960
it's in their best interest.

20:29.994 --> 20:31.796
- Yeah.
That's messed up, actually.

20:31.828 --> 20:33.964
- Isn't it?
- That's really crazy.

20:33.998 --> 20:36.834
'Cause there's a lot
of people in prison

20:36.867 --> 20:40.137
for crimes they didn't do.

20:49.579 --> 20:50.791
<i>The Innocence Project,</i>

20:50.815 --> 20:52.115
<i>an organization dedicated</i>

20:52.149 --> 20:53.885
<i>to uncovering
miscarriages of justice,</i>

20:53.918 --> 20:56.186
<i>estimates that 20,000 people</i>

20:56.219 --> 20:59.088
<i>are currently falsely
imprisoned in the U.S.</i>

20:59.122 --> 21:02.392
<i>The number one cause
is faulty eyewitness testimony,</i>

21:02.425 --> 21:03.759
<i>and the number two cause,</i>

21:03.893 --> 21:05.394
<i>false confession.</i>

21:05.896 --> 21:08.998
<i>Current interrogation techniques
are unreliable.</i>

21:09.032 --> 21:11.134
<i>They can fail to produce
truthful information</i>

21:11.167 --> 21:12.770
<i>from suspects
who are good at lying,</i>

21:12.803 --> 21:14.705
<i>and, perhaps worse,
they can manipulate</i>

21:14.738 --> 21:17.141
<i>innocent suspects
to confess to crimes</i>

21:17.173 --> 21:18.242
<i>they've never committed.</i>

21:18.242 --> 21:20.722
<i>But neuroscientists
may have discovered a method</i>

21:20.744 --> 21:22.613
<i>for extracting the truth
that's impervious</i>

21:22.646 --> 21:25.182
<i>to good liars
and bad interrogators.</i>

21:27.785 --> 21:30.220
<i>Dr. Peter Rosenfeld
and his team</i>

21:30.254 --> 21:31.756
<i>at Northwestern University,</i>

21:31.788 --> 21:33.991
<i>including Ph.D. candidate
Anne Ward,</i>

21:34.025 --> 21:35.793
<i>have developed
a high-tech method</i>

21:35.825 --> 21:37.261
<i>for lie detection.</i>

21:37.295 --> 21:39.162
You guys brought with you today

21:39.196 --> 21:43.067
a P300-based
concealed information test.

21:43.100 --> 21:44.740
How does that work
and how is it different

21:44.768 --> 21:46.904
than a polygraph or traditional

21:46.938 --> 21:49.774
verbal-only
interrogation techniques?

21:49.806 --> 21:51.108
- Well, we're looking at,

21:51.142 --> 21:54.077
um, physiological responses
of the brain

21:54.111 --> 21:56.980
in response to information
that's presented.

21:57.014 --> 21:59.317
And if the information
is meaningful,

21:59.350 --> 22:02.320
like the murder weapon
that a guilty person used,

22:02.353 --> 22:03.787
he will recognize it,

22:03.821 --> 22:05.323
and there's
a brain signature to it.

22:05.355 --> 22:07.858
And so, the machine
that we brought with us

22:07.892 --> 22:09.928
is basically an EEG machine.

22:09.960 --> 22:12.764
- So the way my brain,
your brain,

22:12.796 --> 22:14.140
all of our brains
respond to things

22:14.164 --> 22:17.768
that are meaningful
that we recognize is different

22:17.802 --> 22:20.838
than the way it responds
to novel meaningless things?

22:20.871 --> 22:24.876
- Right.
- Has this been used in a court?

22:24.909 --> 22:27.011
Has it been used
by a prosecution?

22:27.044 --> 22:29.647
- Not in court, There are
some Fifth Amendment issues

22:29.680 --> 22:31.950
as far as betraying,
um, yourself,

22:31.982 --> 22:33.784
based on your brain waves.

22:33.817 --> 22:35.286
But you could use it
for witnesses,

22:35.318 --> 22:37.055
or you could use it
within companies

22:37.087 --> 22:39.222
that are already using
polygraph methods.

22:39.256 --> 22:41.325
- Okay. Well, I'm excited
to see this in action.

22:41.359 --> 22:44.728
I'm gonna step out, you guys are
gonna prepare the first test.

22:44.761 --> 22:46.129
- Okay.
- Excellent. All right.

22:46.162 --> 22:47.865
See you soon.

22:48.833 --> 22:50.668
Okay.

22:50.700 --> 22:51.969
We're ready for the test.

22:52.003 --> 22:53.605
Thank you for joining me.

22:53.638 --> 22:54.805
Hannah from <i> Vsauce,</i>

22:54.838 --> 22:56.106
Wren from Corridor Digital.

22:56.140 --> 22:58.610
So, one of us today
is going to be a thief.

22:58.642 --> 23:00.153
<i> Per Dr. Rosenfeld's
instructions,</i>

23:00.177 --> 23:02.246
<i>we randomly determined
who would be the thief</i>

23:02.278 --> 23:05.315
<i>by seeing whoever
drew the green chip.</i>

23:05.348 --> 23:07.718
Three, two, one.

23:07.751 --> 23:09.720
Hannah's the thief.

23:09.754 --> 23:10.855
My God. I knew it.

23:10.888 --> 23:12.690
So, Hannah, go on in.

23:12.722 --> 23:14.992
- Look at the item.
- Okay.

23:15.026 --> 23:16.693
<i>In this real-world scenario</i>

23:16.727 --> 23:18.329
<i>designed by Dr. Rosenfeld,</i>

23:18.362 --> 23:21.265
<i>the designated thief
actually takes the item,</i>

23:21.297 --> 23:23.901
<i>handles it,
and gets a good look at it.</i>

23:23.933 --> 23:25.369
<i>This activity causes the item</i>

23:25.402 --> 23:27.238
<i>to register
in their mind,</i>

23:27.270 --> 23:29.707
<i>so they can't help
but recognize it later.</i>

23:29.740 --> 23:31.675
<i>The other subjects
are also required</i>

23:31.709 --> 23:34.746
<i>to enter the room and sign in
to prove that they were there.</i>

23:34.878 --> 23:37.347
<i>But they never get a look
at the stolen item.</i>

23:37.381 --> 23:40.418
<i>And, of course, Dr. Rosenfeld
and Anne have no idea</i>

23:40.450 --> 23:41.919
<i>who the thief is.</i>

23:41.951 --> 23:44.655
<i>Then each of us is tested.</i>

23:44.689 --> 23:45.890
Go ahead and take a seat here

23:45.922 --> 23:47.300
and we'll get you all set up.
- Okay.

23:47.324 --> 23:50.128
- Basically, I'm just gonna
put a couple electrodes

23:50.161 --> 23:52.229
behind your ears
and a couple on your face,

23:52.263 --> 23:54.932
and then, um,
the EEG cap on your head.

23:54.965 --> 23:56.734
What you're gonna do
is you're gonna use

23:56.767 --> 23:58.302
these two mice
in front of you...

23:58.334 --> 24:00.037
To respond to the images

24:00.071 --> 24:01.406
that you see on the screen.

24:01.439 --> 24:03.306
So you'll see an image,
a string of numbers,

24:03.340 --> 24:05.043
an image, a string of numbers.

24:05.075 --> 24:08.046
Anytime you see an image,
no matter what it is,

24:08.078 --> 24:09.413
you're gonna press this button.

24:09.447 --> 24:11.181
All right. Are you ready?

24:12.382 --> 24:14.419
<i>The images we were shown</i>

24:14.451 --> 24:16.453
<i>contained a variety
of jewelry items,</i>

24:16.487 --> 24:18.221
<i>including the stolen one.</i>

24:18.255 --> 24:21.825
<i>Of course, Wren and I
hadn't seen any of them before.</i>

24:26.696 --> 24:29.699
<i>Hannah didn't consciously react
to any of them.</i>

24:29.733 --> 24:32.202
<i>But would her brain waves reveal</i>

24:32.234 --> 24:34.637
<i>the one item she recognizes?</i>

24:35.305 --> 24:37.741
<i>It was time for the results.</i>

24:38.508 --> 24:40.178
So here we are.

24:40.210 --> 24:41.945
Have you reached a conclusion?

24:41.978 --> 24:43.881
- Well, based on what we know,

24:43.913 --> 24:47.151
and we know that
the stolen item was a watch.

24:47.183 --> 24:49.052
And so we looked
at the brain waves

24:49.085 --> 24:50.220
in response to the watch

24:50.254 --> 24:51.856
in comparison to the brain waves

24:51.889 --> 24:54.225
in response to other things.

24:54.257 --> 24:58.095
And, we have
two average brain waves,

24:58.129 --> 25:01.165
or event-related
potentials in each frame.

25:01.198 --> 25:03.968
The black one is the average

25:04.000 --> 25:06.002
brain wave response
to the watch.

25:06.036 --> 25:09.239
The red trace there
is the response

25:09.273 --> 25:12.243
to the other stimuli
all averaged together.

25:12.276 --> 25:14.378
We look for
the peak-to-peak difference,

25:14.411 --> 25:17.481
<i>the peak down here,
versus the highest peak</i>

25:17.515 --> 25:19.083
<i>following this peak.</i>

25:19.115 --> 25:22.085
And we measure that,
and it's rather obvious

25:22.119 --> 25:24.889
that the biggest response
we found was,

25:24.921 --> 25:26.490
Hannah's.

25:28.558 --> 25:30.527
- Wow.

25:30.561 --> 25:32.138
And interesting thing, Michael,

25:32.162 --> 25:35.967
is that you had
a special response

25:35.999 --> 25:38.536
to the watch in comparison
to the other items.

25:38.568 --> 25:40.872
That would suggest
that there's something special

25:40.904 --> 25:43.840
about that stimulus, the watch,

25:43.873 --> 25:46.510
that is meaningful to you.
Is it?

25:46.544 --> 25:48.345
- I collect watches.

25:48.379 --> 25:50.414
I have about 40 or 50 of them.

25:50.447 --> 25:52.283
But Hannah might not have
that kind of excuse.

25:52.315 --> 25:54.317
- I don't have that many watches.

25:54.351 --> 25:56.862
- And out of three of you, she
definitely has the biggest response.

25:56.886 --> 25:58.388
- So off to jail.

25:59.590 --> 26:02.526
<i> The P300
concealed information test</i>

26:02.559 --> 26:05.829
<i>correctly identified
which one of us was a thief.</i>

26:05.863 --> 26:08.298
But in this next test,
I will be the only suspect,

26:08.332 --> 26:10.535
and they will know
that I've stolen something.

26:10.567 --> 26:13.871
But the question will be,
what did I steal?

26:13.903 --> 26:15.506
Inside this room
are seven boxes,

26:15.538 --> 26:18.276
<i>and inside those boxes
are seven different items</i>

26:18.308 --> 26:21.812
<i>that I've never seen.
My task is to open only one box</i>

26:21.845 --> 26:23.180
<i>at random and steal that item.</i>

26:23.213 --> 26:25.315
All right.
We've got a...

26:25.348 --> 26:27.084
a camouflage hat.

26:28.352 --> 26:30.454
And that's not all.
During this next test,

26:30.487 --> 26:32.523
I will be implementing
countermeasures

26:32.555 --> 26:34.525
to try to outsmart the test.

26:34.557 --> 26:36.993
<i>I will think
a very strong thought</i>

26:37.026 --> 26:39.564
<i>every time something comes up
that's irrelevant.</i>

26:39.596 --> 26:42.933
<i>Will that enable me
to create brain waves</i>

26:42.967 --> 26:45.303
<i>powerful and dramatic enough</i>

26:45.335 --> 26:47.404
to not be distinguishable
from my response

26:47.438 --> 26:50.474
to the actual item
I'm trying to conceal?

26:50.507 --> 26:52.910
- Anne.
- Hello. Welcome back.

26:52.942 --> 26:55.345
I, committed a crime.

26:55.379 --> 26:57.215
<i> Wish me luck,
because this time,</i>

26:57.248 --> 27:00.551
<i>there will be punishments
like in the real world</i>

27:00.584 --> 27:04.221
<i>where getting caught in a lie
can have consequences.</i>

27:04.255 --> 27:07.123
<i>And my friend Adam Savage
was happy to advise me</i>

27:07.157 --> 27:08.192
<i>on my punishment.</i>

27:08.225 --> 27:09.627
- Adam.
- Michael.

27:09.660 --> 27:10.961
I am going to be taking

27:10.995 --> 27:13.965
an EEG lie detection test.

27:13.998 --> 27:16.299
- Okay.
- If I lose,

27:16.333 --> 27:18.035
- there need to be stakes.
- Yeah.

27:18.067 --> 27:19.302
- Okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:19.335 --> 27:21.538
Naturally, I thought
of Chinese water torture,

27:21.572 --> 27:24.007
<i>which as you know
from personal experience,</i>

27:24.040 --> 27:25.375
<i>is when someone is restrained</i>

27:25.409 --> 27:27.478
<i>while water is dripped
on their forehead.</i>

27:27.510 --> 27:29.946
And then right after that,
I thought, I know just the guy

27:29.979 --> 27:31.548
to talk to about this.
- Okay.

27:31.582 --> 27:33.517
Because I...
I want it to be

27:33.549 --> 27:36.486
actually something
that I'm fearing and dreading.

27:36.519 --> 27:39.389
So, yeah, we did an episode

27:39.422 --> 27:41.491
on Chinese water torture
on <i> Mythbusters,</i>

27:41.525 --> 27:44.228
and the creepiest thing
that happened

27:44.260 --> 27:47.364
after we did this episode

27:47.398 --> 27:49.667
was that I got an email
from someone

27:49.700 --> 27:51.235
from a throwaway account.

27:51.267 --> 27:54.171
He said,
"We found that randomizing

27:54.203 --> 27:57.941
when the drops occurred
was incredibly effective."

27:57.975 --> 28:01.012
That anything that happens
on a regular periodicity

28:01.045 --> 28:02.412
can become a type of meditation,

28:02.446 --> 28:04.282
and you can then tune it out.

28:04.315 --> 28:07.551
If you couldn't predict it,

28:07.584 --> 28:09.286
you're... he said,

28:09.319 --> 28:12.022
"We found, we were able
to induce a psychotic break

28:12.055 --> 28:13.457
within 20 hours."

28:13.489 --> 28:15.692
- Sounds like
the stakes that I want.

28:15.726 --> 28:17.495
- All right.
- Thanks.

28:17.527 --> 28:19.296
You're welcome, sir.

28:19.330 --> 28:20.406
<i>So now, under the threat</i>

28:20.430 --> 28:22.232
<i>of Chinese water torture,</i>

28:22.266 --> 28:25.736
<i>I was extra motivated
to beat the lie detector.</i>

28:29.105 --> 28:30.207
All right.

28:30.239 --> 28:31.409
That is it.

28:32.977 --> 28:34.978
- I was trying
to think about all kinds

28:35.011 --> 28:36.079
of frightening scenarios,

28:36.113 --> 28:37.456
I was trying
to tense up to make sure

28:37.480 --> 28:39.683
I was really uncomfortable
the way I was sitting.

28:39.717 --> 28:41.686
- Well, for most tests,
that would work.

28:41.719 --> 28:44.322
But we will take a look
at this data and see...

28:44.354 --> 28:45.999
- Yes, we will.
- What it shows.

28:47.991 --> 28:49.526
Wow. Okay.

28:49.559 --> 28:51.695
I don't think they're going
to be able to figure out

28:51.728 --> 28:53.965
what item I stole.

28:53.998 --> 28:57.233
<i>I really kept my mind active.</i>

28:57.234 --> 28:58.744
<i>I was going crazy
with countermeasures.</i>

28:58.768 --> 29:01.104
<i>I was sitting uncomfortably,
I was thinking about</i>

29:01.138 --> 29:03.207
all kinds of really
crazy things.

29:03.239 --> 29:04.607
I was thinking about like,

29:04.641 --> 29:06.477
"What if I have
diarrhea right now?

29:06.509 --> 29:08.187
How would that feel?
How do I hold it back?

29:08.211 --> 29:09.512
And maybe I do have diarrhea."

29:09.546 --> 29:11.282
All these things
that were sort of physical

29:11.315 --> 29:13.249
in nature as well.
I thought a lot about death

29:13.283 --> 29:15.086
and dying and being dismembered.

29:15.119 --> 29:17.088
<i>And if they can get it right,</i>

29:17.121 --> 29:19.757
I would probably blame
witchcraft as well as science.

29:19.789 --> 29:21.501
Well, it's...
I would say that's it.

29:21.525 --> 29:23.094
Yeah, okay.

29:23.126 --> 29:25.363
We're ready
to give him our best guess.

29:25.395 --> 29:26.563
Hello.

29:26.596 --> 29:27.430
- Hi.
- Hi.

29:27.465 --> 29:29.467
- Are you guys ready?
- Yup.

29:29.499 --> 29:32.103
- Let me ask you this.
First of all,

29:32.135 --> 29:34.604
how confident do you feel?

29:34.638 --> 29:35.639
- Pretty confident.

29:35.671 --> 29:38.209
- What did I take?

29:38.241 --> 29:39.276
- The camo hat.

29:39.308 --> 29:40.744
- Camo hat.
- Camo hat?

29:40.777 --> 29:41.778
- Yeah.

29:47.551 --> 29:49.487
That's impressive.

29:49.519 --> 29:52.288
Did you see any evidence
of countermeasures being used?

29:52.322 --> 29:54.325
- Not something I would swear to.

29:54.357 --> 29:56.226
- Even while I was doing the test,

29:56.259 --> 29:57.761
I thought, you know what?

29:57.795 --> 30:02.266
<i>I'm reacting too quickly
to the actual item.</i>

30:02.298 --> 30:06.036
I should also treat it
as though it's irrelevant.

30:06.069 --> 30:07.312
I should treat them
all the same.

30:07.336 --> 30:09.373
If you are consistently

30:09.405 --> 30:12.275
reacting to all
of the irrelevance

30:12.308 --> 30:14.644
with their specific
countermeasure responses

30:14.678 --> 30:16.781
that you formed in your mind,

30:16.814 --> 30:19.617
they should produce
bigger P300s also.

30:19.650 --> 30:23.153
But the biggest will still be
produced by the camo hat,

30:23.187 --> 30:25.189
even if you were
countering it also.

30:25.221 --> 30:29.692
- That means
I now have to be punished.

30:32.696 --> 30:34.498
Science is improving
in its ability

30:34.530 --> 30:36.499
to read people's minds.

30:36.533 --> 30:38.836
And that raises some
difficult ethical dilemmas.

30:38.869 --> 30:42.807
We would have nothing to fear
from perfect lie detectors

30:42.840 --> 30:46.410
if the people using them
had perfect morals.

30:46.442 --> 30:49.279
So, the prospect of a
scientifically rigorous method

30:49.313 --> 30:52.349
of extracting information,
while exciting,

30:52.382 --> 30:54.418
is also terrifying.

30:54.450 --> 30:56.687
As we continue to probe
interrogation methods

30:56.719 --> 30:59.222
scientifically,
we have to also continue

30:59.256 --> 31:01.792
to probe them ethically.

31:01.825 --> 31:05.462
You know, Chinese water torture
isn't even Chinese.

31:05.496 --> 31:08.165
Its earliest description
comes from Italy

31:08.198 --> 31:09.566
in the 15th century.

31:09.600 --> 31:11.535
And the Chinese name
was added later

31:11.567 --> 31:14.238
to make it sound
more mysterious.

31:14.270 --> 31:16.840
Man, these irregular drops

31:16.873 --> 31:19.410
are supposed to drive you
slowly insane.

31:19.442 --> 31:21.545
You know, I think
this is a lot less

31:21.577 --> 31:25.215
about getting information
and more about punishment.

31:25.248 --> 31:27.785
And as always,

31:27.817 --> 31:29.286
thanks for watching.
