00:39.834 --> 00:42.001
<i>Magic trick.</i>

00:44.434 --> 00:45.400
Oh!

00:50.335 --> 00:54.098
You guys. That poor kid
might have really gotten hurt.

00:54.100 --> 00:56.532
Oh, sweetie. It's hilarious.

00:56.534 --> 01:00.731
OK, we are late. I gotta go.

01:00.733 --> 01:02.767
Thanks for
taking care of her, Dad.

01:02.769 --> 01:04.599
Bye, Rudie. I love you.

01:04.601 --> 01:06.899
Bye, Chickenbutt.

01:06.901 --> 01:09.133
Let's get one of us both.

01:09.135 --> 01:11.369
- OK.
- OK.

01:15.202 --> 01:17.766
<i>There's no place
like Magic Land.</i>

01:17.768 --> 01:20.034
That looks fun.

01:20.036 --> 01:21.866
Of course, I can't go.

01:21.868 --> 01:26.504
Oh, it's all hype anyway.
You make your own fun.

01:27.268 --> 01:31.701
Besides, amusement parks
these days...

01:31.703 --> 01:35.367
Let's just say Magic Land
lost its magic a long time ago.

01:35.369 --> 01:38.468
<i>Or for the best deal,
purchase a memb...</i>

01:38.470 --> 01:40.504
And I should know.

01:43.070 --> 01:45.100
Your mom ever tell you
that your old papaw

01:45.102 --> 01:48.137
owned one of the greatest
amusement parks of all time?

01:49.804 --> 01:52.067
- She didn't?
- No.

01:52.069 --> 01:56.270
What? It was epic.
That's my damn legacy.

01:57.570 --> 01:59.902
Yeah, this was when
I was living

01:59.904 --> 02:02.303
up in the woods
near Calico Ridge.

02:02.305 --> 02:05.070
Oof! It was a wild time.

02:11.604 --> 02:13.102
Things could be worse.

02:13.104 --> 02:15.501
<i>My next-door neighbor
was an alcoholic bear</i>

02:15.503 --> 02:19.504
<i>who would sneak into my yard
and try to kill me for my beer.</i>

02:20.205 --> 02:22.502
<i>Yep, true story.</i>

02:22.504 --> 02:24.772
Go on. Go away.

02:25.405 --> 02:29.136
Go away. No, no, no. Come on.
No, no, no, no, no, no. No, no.

02:29.138 --> 02:31.970
Don't be a prick.
Don't you be a prick.

02:35.172 --> 02:38.303
<i>He was a persistent
little bastard too.</i>

02:38.305 --> 02:40.204
<i>I would have shared
the beer with him,</i>

02:40.206 --> 02:42.670
<i>but he was
kind of an angry drunk.</i>

02:42.672 --> 02:45.436
No, no, no, no.
Go, go, go, go.

02:45.438 --> 02:47.172
Good boy.

03:08.039 --> 03:10.006
Oh, fuck.

03:23.339 --> 03:27.305
- Come on, Papaw.
- What? That's how it happened.

03:27.307 --> 03:28.707
Honest Injun.

03:30.307 --> 03:33.340
Guess you can't
say that anymore.

03:34.107 --> 03:36.005
<i>Those days were different.</i>

03:36.007 --> 03:38.006
<i>There weren't so many rules.</i>

03:38.008 --> 03:40.804
<i>Kids were allowed
just to be kids</i>

03:40.806 --> 03:42.840
<i>and do what kids love to do.</i>

03:43.608 --> 03:46.975
<i>Dumb, crazy shit
they might regret.</i>

03:54.075 --> 03:56.039
<i>Action Point was my baby.</i>

03:56.041 --> 03:58.272
<i>I built her from the ground up.</i>

03:58.274 --> 04:00.039
<i>It wasn't some huge
monster park,</i>

04:00.041 --> 04:01.706
<i>just a couple
of slides and rides,</i>

04:01.708 --> 04:05.075
<i>but all the kids in town
loved it.</i>

04:06.509 --> 04:08.473
<i>And the ones
who had nowhere to go</i>

04:08.475 --> 04:11.440
<i>and no one to look after 'em,
well, I put 'em to work.</i>

04:11.442 --> 04:13.976
<i>I called them the Shitbirds.</i>

04:14.409 --> 04:17.373
<i>There was Ziffel.
He was our chief engineer.</i>

04:17.375 --> 04:20.543
<i>Stiv worked security.</i>

04:21.076 --> 04:22.372
Don't fuck with me.

04:22.374 --> 04:25.507
<i>Four Finger Annie
was our ride supervisor.</i>

04:25.509 --> 04:28.508
<i>Rodney, he was the numbers guy.</i>

04:28.510 --> 04:31.207
<i>Hot Headed Pete
was in charge of complaining.</i>

04:31.209 --> 04:33.874
Can someone help me with this?
Hello?

04:33.876 --> 04:35.707
<i>And then there was Killer.</i>

04:35.709 --> 04:39.374
<i>He wasn't exactly a kid
and he wasn't on the payroll,</i>

04:39.376 --> 04:40.975
<i>but he did come every day</i>

04:40.977 --> 04:43.775
<i>to pick fights
with random strangers.</i>

04:43.777 --> 04:45.575
<i>Never a dull moment.</i>

04:45.577 --> 04:46.675
<i>To be honest,</i>

04:46.677 --> 04:49.709
<i>I think he escaped
from a mental hospital.</i>

04:49.711 --> 04:53.174
<i>Anyhoo, the park bordered
the Calico River,</i>

04:53.176 --> 04:55.708
<i>so we had water activities too.</i>

04:55.710 --> 04:58.709
<i>And your Great Uncle Benny
was in charge down there.</i>

04:58.711 --> 05:01.609
<i>Not one single person
ever drowned on his watch</i>

05:01.611 --> 05:02.543
<i>most of the time.</i>

05:02.545 --> 05:04.274
- And I looked up...
- Help!

05:04.276 --> 05:07.475
...and I saw her vagina
staring me right in the eye.

05:07.477 --> 05:10.909
And I knew, like, "No,
this is not just for peeing.

05:10.911 --> 05:12.576
This is for something else."

05:12.578 --> 05:16.009
Up until then I thought
babies came out of the butt.

05:16.011 --> 05:17.976
<i>Everyone loved to hear
his stories,</i>

05:17.978 --> 05:20.144
<i>none of which I will share
with you, young lady.</i>

05:20.146 --> 05:21.609
Help me!

05:21.611 --> 05:23.475
<i>Back then
there was a little thing</i>

05:23.477 --> 05:26.009
<i>called personal responsibility.</i>

05:26.011 --> 05:28.310
<i>If you screwed up and got hurt,</i>

05:28.312 --> 05:31.144
<i>you didn't call no lawyer
or the media.</i>

05:31.146 --> 05:32.709
<i>You just dusted yourself off</i>

05:32.711 --> 05:35.712
<i>and bragged about it
to your dumb little buddies.</i>

05:41.812 --> 05:44.843
That sounds awesome.
What happened to it?

05:46.579 --> 05:48.613
Oh.

05:48.913 --> 05:51.677
Well, that's a long story.

05:51.679 --> 05:54.679
But we have
all afternoon, right?

05:55.580 --> 05:58.045
Well,
you're absolutely right.

05:58.047 --> 06:00.281
Hey, speaking of...

06:01.848 --> 06:05.647
Who wants a little mani-pedi?
I mean, it's just us girls.

06:17.713 --> 06:19.612
Go, go, go!

06:19.614 --> 06:21.714
Lay off the brakes,
asshole.

06:25.481 --> 06:28.581
- Whoo-hoo!
- Here, boss.

06:32.746 --> 06:36.145
Goddamn it, Lumpy.
What were you trying to do?

06:36.147 --> 06:38.414
- I wanted to go faster.
- That's fair.

06:42.082 --> 06:43.113
Give me that tape.

06:44.847 --> 06:45.915
Just hold it.

06:47.347 --> 06:50.348
Give her the old
criss-cross apple sauce.

06:52.414 --> 06:55.715
All right, that'll hold her
for a bit, Merle.

06:58.281 --> 07:01.947
Now, let me take a look
at that thing.

07:01.949 --> 07:04.182
Whoo-wee! Mmm.

07:06.349 --> 07:07.314
Going to...

07:07.316 --> 07:08.815
There we go.

07:11.716 --> 07:13.913
What? That's what
it was invented for in Vietnam.

07:13.915 --> 07:16.646
Better than stitches,
stronger than skin.

07:16.648 --> 07:18.916
You're gonna be all right.

07:19.984 --> 07:22.414
Where the hell's Rodney?

07:22.416 --> 07:24.216
Rodney!

07:27.383 --> 07:29.818
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

07:31.716 --> 07:34.047
Something's off.
I see our regular kids.

07:34.049 --> 07:37.814
But where's the fresh fish?
What's our attendance today?

07:37.816 --> 07:41.149
Down about 45%.
Pretty close to my projections.

07:41.151 --> 07:44.551
It could be worse,
considering 7 Parks just opened.

07:45.883 --> 07:48.114
The new amusement park
a half hour's drive from here.

07:48.116 --> 07:51.115
I told you they were building it
all last winter.

07:51.117 --> 07:54.216
That's not my listening season.
You should have told me louder.

07:54.218 --> 07:58.949
You heard me. It's just that
selective proactivity of yours.

07:58.951 --> 08:01.052
Get lost, Rodney.

08:11.651 --> 08:14.950
Hello there.
Any of you work here?

08:14.952 --> 08:17.616
Yeah, not if we can help it.

08:17.618 --> 08:22.349
Oh, I see. I'm Greg Knoblach
with Trustwood Developments.

08:22.351 --> 08:24.585
You've probably seen
my billboards.

08:26.086 --> 08:27.816
Huh?

08:27.818 --> 08:31.083
OK. I was looking for D.C.

08:31.085 --> 08:33.150
Well, lookee here. Old Knoblick.

08:33.153 --> 08:37.051
It's Knoblach, and that wasn't
even funny in high school.

08:37.053 --> 08:40.351
D.C.,
the chairlift broke again.

08:40.352 --> 08:42.818
- Oh, shit.
- Help me!

08:42.820 --> 08:44.454
Rodney!

08:44.953 --> 08:46.785
Amazing.

08:46.787 --> 08:48.517
Anyway, back to why I'm here.

08:48.519 --> 08:51.451
I suppose you probably heard you
got some competition in town now.

08:51.453 --> 08:53.784
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I know all about 7 Narcs.

08:53.786 --> 08:56.685
Yeah. Here, take a look
at those, kids.

08:56.687 --> 08:59.052
They've got log flumes,
roller coasters,

08:59.054 --> 09:01.786
and a chairlift
that actually works.

09:01.788 --> 09:03.185
Mm-hm.

09:03.187 --> 09:04.884
My son Travis just took a job
there for the summer.

09:04.886 --> 09:06.752
Little cocksucker.

09:06.754 --> 09:09.954
Looks like a big, bright,
shiny corporate asshole to me.

09:11.421 --> 09:13.455
OK, listen, D.C.

09:14.187 --> 09:17.053
- What's he got in here?
- I got friends at the bank.

09:17.055 --> 09:20.688
So I know you took out a loan
on this place last year.

09:21.253 --> 09:23.387
What was it, 100,000?

09:23.721 --> 09:26.022
How are you ever
gonna pay that off?

09:26.754 --> 09:28.452
Let me find a buyer
for your land.

09:28.454 --> 09:30.922
It's not gonna be easy, but
I'm sure I can find somebody.

09:32.587 --> 09:35.018
Well, look, Nodgecock,

09:35.020 --> 09:37.786
I didn't build this place
for you or the bank.

09:37.788 --> 09:39.786
I built it for the kids.

09:39.788 --> 09:43.953
So I'm not selling
to any of you fanny-blowers.

09:43.955 --> 09:44.854
Good day.

09:47.288 --> 09:48.721
Hey. Hey!

09:48.723 --> 09:53.557
Hey, those are Cubans.
Give me that. Give me that.

09:54.857 --> 09:57.489
You're lucky we saved
your people in that war.

09:58.423 --> 10:03.423
<i>And that's about the time
your mom arrived for the summer.</i>

10:18.824 --> 10:20.821
- Chickenbutt! Hi.
- Hi!

10:20.823 --> 10:23.756
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

10:24.390 --> 10:26.624
Oh. I recognize those.

10:28.656 --> 10:31.256
How's your mom?
Still hate me?

10:31.258 --> 10:33.791
Still with that guy,
the physical therapist?

10:34.158 --> 10:36.856
She doesn't hate you,
and you know he's a doctor.

10:36.858 --> 10:39.091
Yeah, that's what he says.

10:40.191 --> 10:42.459
All right, baby.

10:43.325 --> 10:45.190
Well, let's hit it.

10:48.592 --> 10:51.623
You remember this one? You used
to love it when you were a kid.

10:57.792 --> 11:00.492
Here.

11:02.226 --> 11:03.557
Listen to this.

11:09.892 --> 11:13.093
Beat's good, but the lead singer
sounds kind of harelipped.

11:13.859 --> 11:17.189
- They're called The Clash.
- Ah, The Clash.

11:17.191 --> 11:20.191
They're playing New York.
A lot of my friends are going.

11:20.193 --> 11:21.926
It's no big deal.

11:23.726 --> 11:25.291
They're actually all right.

11:25.293 --> 11:28.190
Hey, well, I think
their tour's coming through LA.

11:28.192 --> 11:31.425
You think maybe
we could check 'em out?

11:31.427 --> 11:33.660
Sure. We got all summer.

11:39.060 --> 11:41.094
Home sweet home.

11:43.527 --> 11:45.828
House looks the same.

11:47.127 --> 11:49.861
Spent a little time
cleaning her up.

11:51.093 --> 11:53.561
I got the luggage.
Don't worry about it.

11:57.327 --> 11:58.892
<i>Draw.</i>

11:58.894 --> 12:01.195
<i>Huh. Too slow.</i>

12:03.061 --> 12:05.593
- Boogie!
- Benny! Oh, my God!

12:05.595 --> 12:08.761
The hell you doing here? You're
supposed to be at the lagoon.

12:11.628 --> 12:14.228
I don't believe it.
You blossomed.

12:16.727 --> 12:19.125
Um, I'm gonna go unpack.

12:19.127 --> 12:22.060
- You gotta see my new hatchet.
- Oh, Jesus.

12:22.062 --> 12:24.359
I invented this game.
It's called Kill the White Man.

12:24.361 --> 12:26.259
You think this shirt
makes me look fat?

12:26.261 --> 12:28.459
I don't really care if it does.
It's rad.

12:28.461 --> 12:30.629
I stole it from my sister.

12:38.362 --> 12:40.460
Oh, please, Dad.
It's a tampon.

12:40.462 --> 12:42.827
Do not swear at me, young lady.

12:42.829 --> 12:44.427
It's fine.
It's totally natural.

12:44.429 --> 12:48.193
She left Action Point a child.
She returned a woman.

12:48.195 --> 12:50.795
All right, that's it. Back to the lagoon.

12:51.761 --> 12:53.661
Come by
and see me later, Boogie.

12:53.663 --> 12:55.761
We'll gab
like little schoolgirls.

12:55.763 --> 12:57.595
- OK, Benny.
- Bye.

12:58.596 --> 13:00.194
He's a peach.

13:00.196 --> 13:03.093
Oh, God. I'm gonna go.
Are you OK?

13:03.095 --> 13:06.530
Um, actually...
Well, no. No, it can wait.

13:06.864 --> 13:08.928
- You sure?
- Yeah. I'm gonna get a shower.

13:08.930 --> 13:11.294
I'll come find you later.
We can talk then.

13:11.296 --> 13:12.995
OK. Um...

13:12.997 --> 13:16.562
Oh, we got a rogue bear
around here, so keep an eye out.

13:16.564 --> 13:19.796
There's some bear repellent
over next to the hairspray.

13:19.798 --> 13:21.796
But don't get 'em mixed up.

13:21.798 --> 13:23.695
<i>Draw.</i>

13:23.697 --> 13:25.296
<i>Too slow.</i>

13:25.298 --> 13:27.529
<i>Sounds like my mom's
worst nightmare.</i>

13:27.531 --> 13:29.195
Well, it wasn't back then.

13:29.197 --> 13:33.695
She wasn't the uptight...
excellent mother she is now.

13:33.697 --> 13:35.931
She was pretty normal.

13:37.732 --> 13:39.662
Come on,
I was gonna paint your nails.

13:39.664 --> 13:41.163
- You don't wanna...
- Papaw.

13:41.165 --> 13:44.899
You... Oh. Oh, OK.
Suit yourself.

13:53.032 --> 13:55.966
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
My tootsies are ticklish.

13:56.532 --> 13:59.598
Nah. Nah, nah,
nah, nah. No!

13:59.600 --> 14:01.564
Ooh. Ooh, you touched 'em.

14:01.566 --> 14:03.563
- Ooh.
- It looks good.

14:03.565 --> 14:06.098
- It's an improvement.
- Ooh.

14:15.065 --> 14:17.663
- Smartass.
- All right, let's do this.

14:17.665 --> 14:19.933
Boogie, it's on you.

14:22.765 --> 14:24.132
You ready, Stiv?

14:25.167 --> 14:26.497
OK.

14:27.666 --> 14:30.367
Three, two, one!

14:32.733 --> 14:36.066
- It works!
- Sorry, Stiv!

14:36.801 --> 14:38.333
She's not sorry.

14:38.900 --> 14:40.199
Hey, D.C.

14:40.968 --> 14:42.798
Relax, Pete.

14:42.800 --> 14:46.465
It's not gonna hurt you.
Just a baby snake.

14:46.467 --> 14:49.233
- Oh, my God.
- Found him out in the woodpile.

14:49.235 --> 14:51.468
What do you think, D.C.?
Can I keep him?

14:51.801 --> 14:54.568
Sure, Killer. Just get him
the hell out of here.

14:55.600 --> 14:56.066
Awesome.

14:56.068 --> 14:59.433
Hey, D.C., not so awesome
is that snake

14:59.435 --> 15:02.068
came from underneath the
last piece of lumber we got.

15:02.468 --> 15:05.799
Oh, damn.
We need that wood for the rides.

15:05.801 --> 15:08.367
How we looking on funds,
Rodney?

15:09.901 --> 15:11.299
Well, no problem.

15:11.301 --> 15:14.800
We can go get some more
after closing tonight.

15:14.802 --> 15:17.267
I know a place
we can get it on credit.

15:17.269 --> 15:18.836
Get back to it.

15:20.735 --> 15:23.334
Siouxie, come on.

15:23.336 --> 15:25.769
Let's go.
Let's load her up.

15:26.502 --> 15:28.434
Are we in?

15:28.436 --> 15:31.602
- We're in.
- All right. Let's go.

15:36.203 --> 15:39.035
Ugh. This place
gives me the creeps.

15:43.669 --> 15:45.904
All right, hand me the key.

15:50.236 --> 15:53.968
Come on. Come on, Siouxie.
Good girl.

15:53.970 --> 15:56.204
Good girl, Siouxie.

15:58.970 --> 16:01.202
Look, Siouxie.
Look, Siouxie.

16:01.204 --> 16:03.567
Oh, who's that?
Oh, he's so handsome.

16:03.569 --> 16:05.503
You get him. Good girl.

16:08.103 --> 16:11.771
Oh, you get him. Go on.
Good girl, Siouxie.

16:21.671 --> 16:24.138
Whoa.

16:29.471 --> 16:30.971
Come on, guys.
Let's go!

16:30.973 --> 16:34.236
We're going.

16:34.238 --> 16:35.937
Just shove it.

16:35.939 --> 16:39.173
Watch out, Rodney. Move your ass.
Get the goddamn...

16:41.137 --> 16:43.337
- Just move.
- Fucking... Give me that.

16:43.339 --> 16:45.238
Damn it.

16:46.739 --> 16:48.439
Keep it moving.

16:54.440 --> 16:56.473
Motherfucker.

17:36.774 --> 17:39.407
- Shh.
- What are you doing?

17:39.807 --> 17:41.174
Come on.

17:45.841 --> 17:47.473
I talked to the mayor.

17:47.475 --> 17:50.205
We are talking about
a very big deal here.

17:50.207 --> 17:52.005
I don't want you
standing out there

17:52.007 --> 17:53.740
with your balls in the wind.

17:53.742 --> 17:55.107
Take my word for it,

17:55.109 --> 17:56.873
as soon as this guy
misses his next payment,

17:56.875 --> 17:59.639
you are getting Action Point
at short sale prices,

17:59.641 --> 18:01.508
with no other bidders.

18:02.174 --> 18:03.940
You can trust me on this...

18:03.942 --> 18:06.007
- What you doing?
- Sorry, D.C.

18:06.009 --> 18:09.207
My tummy gets upset
when we do black ops.

18:09.209 --> 18:10.143
Dad?

18:10.841 --> 18:13.107
- No, no.
- What? What?

18:13.109 --> 18:14.608
Go, go, go.

18:26.109 --> 18:29.007
Siouxie! Siouxie!
Come on, Siouxie Sioux!

18:29.009 --> 18:30.977
Sioux! Siouxie Sioux!

18:31.843 --> 18:33.875
Get in the truck!

18:33.877 --> 18:38.041
Siouxie! Siouxie! Siouxie Sioux!
Siouxie, come on, girl.

18:38.043 --> 18:40.609
- Come on, Siouxie.
- Come on!

18:40.611 --> 18:43.009
Come on, baby. Good girl.

18:43.011 --> 18:45.244
- Come on!
- Let's go!

18:45.910 --> 18:47.341
- Get her in.
- Get the dog.

18:47.343 --> 18:49.311
- I got her. Let's go.
- Come on!

18:52.343 --> 18:56.407
Knoblach thinks he's selling our
place to those 7 Park pricks.

18:56.409 --> 18:58.976
Hey,
why is your dog's ass wet?

19:00.744 --> 19:03.209
<i>I knew I had to
come up with a big idea,</i>

19:03.211 --> 19:04.776
<i>an idea that would catch fire</i>

19:04.778 --> 19:08.209
<i>and help us compete with
those corporate douchebags.</i>

19:08.211 --> 19:10.709
<i>But, whew, it wasn't easy.</i>

19:10.711 --> 19:13.142
<i>Thinking is not my superpower.</i>

19:42.013 --> 19:45.110
Ooh. Oh!

19:45.112 --> 19:46.679
Goddamn it.

20:10.181 --> 20:11.315
Hi, Boogie.

20:32.313 --> 20:34.913
- Come on. We need more slack.
- It's coming.

20:34.915 --> 20:37.312
You guys are supposed to be cleaning the
slide. What the hell are you doing?

20:37.314 --> 20:40.146
Yeah, we're gonna
power-wash it.

20:40.148 --> 20:43.550
Fucking stupid cart. Fuck!

20:44.814 --> 20:45.782
On Pete?

20:46.215 --> 20:47.316
Yeah.

20:49.449 --> 20:52.579
So, uh, how are the numbers,
Rodney? How are we looking?

20:52.581 --> 20:56.846
- Attendance is up.
- That's good. How much?

20:56.848 --> 20:58.782
- 1%.
- Oh.

20:59.516 --> 21:03.616
Well, sounds like
we gotta up our game.

21:04.250 --> 21:07.450
- Hey, Pete!
- What?

21:08.949 --> 21:10.650
Whoa!

21:12.282 --> 21:14.881
- Oh, shit.
- Sorry, D.C.

21:14.883 --> 21:16.449
Holy shit.

21:18.950 --> 21:22.316
Holy shit.

21:24.183 --> 21:27.883
<i>Sometimes I get my best
ideas when I'm freshly concussed.</i>

21:28.417 --> 21:30.849
<i>As I was lying on my back
on the verge of a seizure,</i>

21:30.851 --> 21:32.884
<i>something happened.</i>

21:33.749 --> 21:38.116
<i>It was a damned epiphany,
a real eureka moment.</i>

21:41.618 --> 21:44.617
Are you OK?
It was Ziffel's idea.

21:45.350 --> 21:48.417
Action Point team meeting.
Let's go.

21:50.084 --> 21:53.485
All right, everybody. Listen up.

21:54.351 --> 21:56.950
Ow. Shit.

21:57.452 --> 22:00.149
All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:00.151 --> 22:03.450
We're not in trouble because
I think I got this, all right?

22:03.452 --> 22:06.382
What this place needs
is an excitement enema.

22:06.384 --> 22:08.549
7 Parks may have taken
our customers,

22:08.551 --> 22:10.151
but we can take 'em right back.

22:10.518 --> 22:12.016
So what we're gonna do

22:12.018 --> 22:14.251
is we're gonna make this place
fast and loose,

22:14.517 --> 22:16.117
teach these little cooter-flutes

22:16.119 --> 22:19.016
to use a little hand-eye
coordination for a change.

22:19.018 --> 22:21.850
We'll let 7 Parks
be about what you can't do.

22:21.852 --> 22:24.417
Action Point is gonna be
about what you <i>can</i> do.

22:24.419 --> 22:27.686
- Yeah!
- So what are you going to do?

22:28.018 --> 22:30.017
We're gonna take the brakes
off this place.

22:30.019 --> 22:33.850
Every ride, every attraction,
no rules, no speed limits.

22:33.852 --> 22:36.620
- Just pure fun.
- Yeah!

22:37.320 --> 22:40.517
All right, you Shitbirds, size
it up and paste it on a pigeon.

22:40.519 --> 22:42.652
Our ass is getting started
right now.

22:42.654 --> 22:44.216
Let's go!

22:44.218 --> 22:45.683
After lunch.

22:45.685 --> 22:48.218
Yeah, so, yeah, that's
the speed limiter right there.

22:48.220 --> 22:49.820
Well, rip the sucker off.

22:50.453 --> 22:53.187
Ah! You ready, Slappy?

22:54.486 --> 22:56.486
All right, here we go.

22:58.020 --> 23:00.055
Oh, yeah.

23:00.454 --> 23:04.188
- Is he gonna be OK?
- He's fine.

23:08.152 --> 23:10.621
And bye-bye, Mr. Brakes.

23:11.087 --> 23:12.720
One, two, three.

23:15.622 --> 23:18.285
Looks good. Who's first?

23:18.287 --> 23:20.520
I'm breaking this bastard in.

23:25.853 --> 23:29.654
- Oh, my God!
- Hope that's a strong line.

23:33.988 --> 23:37.921
Oh, fuck!

23:43.555 --> 23:45.488
What the fuck?

23:50.955 --> 23:53.554
All right, this is called
the loop-dee-loop.

23:53.556 --> 23:59.256
"Oh, I'm walking up the steps
and I'm in. Whoa!"

24:00.123 --> 24:01.889
Yeah? All right.

24:02.556 --> 24:04.824
- Give Daddy a little push.
- Good luck.

24:10.457 --> 24:11.955
Whoa!

24:31.191 --> 24:32.687
- Fuck.
- Ow.

24:32.689 --> 24:36.389
- Holy shit, that was amazing.
- You want this?

24:36.391 --> 24:39.289
I think you're gonna
have to feather it a little

24:39.291 --> 24:41.192
on that last turn.

24:41.457 --> 24:43.790
- I'm next.
- Fuck you. I'm next.

24:44.857 --> 24:46.423
- Help me up.
- You OK, boss?

24:46.425 --> 24:48.059
Ow.

24:49.724 --> 24:52.457
- Thanks.
- That was incredible.

25:10.959 --> 25:13.489
Have you tethered
any of that down yet? Damn it.

25:13.491 --> 25:15.425
Yeah, yeah,
I'm working on it.

25:16.226 --> 25:19.892
Shouldn't we be facing the water
in case someone needs help?

25:20.293 --> 25:22.459
Ah, let God sort 'em out.

25:29.360 --> 25:30.957
Dude, what the fuck?

25:30.959 --> 25:33.758
It's like one continuous
train wreck.

25:33.760 --> 25:35.392
Now, to the untrained eye,

25:35.394 --> 25:38.223
all this might look
dangerous and haphazard,

25:38.225 --> 25:43.327
but your father is an artiste
and this is his canvas.

25:44.461 --> 25:45.928
Oh!

25:46.594 --> 25:49.460
I want to talk to him
about something, but...

25:50.827 --> 25:53.525
I'm kind of dreading it.
I mean, it's not a big deal.

25:53.527 --> 25:56.693
It's just... he may think
it's a big deal.

25:57.527 --> 25:59.625
It's just Mom travels so much
with work,

25:59.627 --> 26:02.460
and her boyfriend looks after me
most of the time.

26:02.928 --> 26:06.560
He floated the idea
and Mom liked it, and...

26:06.562 --> 26:07.828
What is it?

26:10.094 --> 26:12.659
That he become an official
legal guardian of mine,

26:12.661 --> 26:15.059
and I need Dad
to sign the papers.

26:15.061 --> 26:16.994
Holy shit. Really?

26:16.996 --> 26:18.693
Mmm.

26:18.695 --> 26:21.193
Whoa. No, no, no, no, no.

26:21.195 --> 26:23.861
Your dad is not gonna
like that at all.

26:24.463 --> 26:25.726
Look, I thought I had problems,

26:25.728 --> 26:28.426
but you, young lady,
you have problems.

26:28.428 --> 26:29.963
Shut up, Benny.

26:31.097 --> 26:34.226
It'll work itself out.
It always does.

26:34.228 --> 26:36.262
Oh, whoa!

26:36.762 --> 26:38.796
- Jeez!
- I'm sorry.

26:41.796 --> 26:46.127
Do you work here?
Does anybody work here?

26:46.129 --> 26:47.928
Yeah, yeah.

26:47.930 --> 26:52.261
My son is stuck up there
and he won't come down.

26:52.263 --> 26:56.129
- Please, just do something.
- Absolutely.

26:57.063 --> 26:59.730
Get down from there,
you little bastard!

27:02.497 --> 27:03.629
- No!
- Walk it off.

27:03.631 --> 27:05.598
Whoo!

27:12.031 --> 27:15.928
- That was fucking awesome.
- You deserved that.

27:15.930 --> 27:19.427
This place should be
closed down.

27:19.429 --> 27:21.531
Come on, Leslie.

27:23.364 --> 27:26.195
- What'd she say?
- She said, "Come on, Leslie."

27:26.197 --> 27:27.629
Before that.

27:27.631 --> 27:30.065
She said this place
should be closed down.

27:30.430 --> 27:32.031
She may be right.

27:33.264 --> 27:37.496
This place is a lawless,
reckless free-for-all,

27:37.498 --> 27:39.699
and people
need to know about it.

27:44.898 --> 27:47.931
So why are we boycotting
our own park?

27:47.933 --> 27:50.563
Because there's no better
publicity than a boycott.

27:50.565 --> 27:53.997
Remember the big grape boycott
that helped the farm workers?

27:53.999 --> 27:56.764
Yeah. Yeah,
we studied it this year.

27:56.766 --> 27:58.429
Grape sales
went through the roof

27:58.431 --> 27:59.831
'cause all anybody ever heard

27:59.833 --> 28:02.330
was the word "grape"
over and over again.

28:02.332 --> 28:04.764
And why the shit
are we dressed like this?

28:04.766 --> 28:06.832
So we blend in, Pete.

28:29.234 --> 28:31.831
<i>Knoblach was greasing
the wheels all over town,</i>

28:31.833 --> 28:34.465
<i>trying to steal away
Action Point's land.</i>

28:34.467 --> 28:37.431
- <i>He even had the mayor in his hip pocket.</i>
- Thank you.

28:37.433 --> 28:40.432
A very exciting day here today.

28:40.434 --> 28:43.731
And I would like to applaud
Trustwood Developments

28:43.733 --> 28:47.565
for all their efforts
on helping us revitalize

28:47.567 --> 28:50.467
downtown Calico Ridge.

28:51.500 --> 28:53.632
But what are you going to do
about Action Point?

28:53.634 --> 28:54.602
Yeah.

28:55.201 --> 28:56.932
- Excuse me?
- Action Point.

28:56.934 --> 29:00.432
- That place is out of control.
- That guy's right.

29:00.434 --> 29:02.431
They just put in
a zipline there,

29:02.433 --> 29:04.900
and all the girls are flashing their titties.

29:04.902 --> 29:06.734
No, no, I didn't know that.

29:06.736 --> 29:10.203
And beer is so cheap, they're
practically giving it away.

29:10.835 --> 29:13.033
Action Point
is the craziest place

29:13.035 --> 29:15.399
with the most dangerous rides
in the world.

29:15.401 --> 29:17.900
- Who do we wanna close?
- Action Point!

29:17.902 --> 29:20.869
- When do we wanna close it?
- After Labor Day.

29:21.401 --> 29:25.767
Hey, hey! Ho, ho!
Action Point has got to go!

29:25.769 --> 29:27.468
Hey, hey! Ho, ho!

29:27.470 --> 29:29.468
<i>Action Point has got to go!</i>

29:29.470 --> 29:31.236
<i>Hey, hey! Ho, ho!</i>

29:32.336 --> 29:33.701
<i>The plan worked.</i>

29:33.703 --> 29:35.500
<i>Word had gotten out
that Action Point</i>

29:35.502 --> 29:39.768
<i>was the craziest, rowdiest
no-holds-barred amusement park</i>

29:39.770 --> 29:41.601
<i>in the good old US of A.</i>

29:49.303 --> 29:53.268
<i>Slappy added a special ingredient
to the cotton candy that day,</i>

29:53.270 --> 29:55.368
<i>and the kids loved it.</i>

30:06.205 --> 30:10.104
This cotton candy's getting
quite popular. OK, OK, OK.

30:15.438 --> 30:17.736
<i>And, of course, Knoblach
got wind of our good fortune</i>

30:17.738 --> 30:21.935
<i>and he sent his pissant little
son Travis over to spy on us.</i>

30:21.937 --> 30:26.204
Jesus. Look at all these
fucking pathetic losers.

30:27.371 --> 30:29.337
Hey, here you go, babe.

30:29.339 --> 30:32.940
Nice shorts.
Watch where you're going.

30:34.071 --> 30:36.339
Hey, Bobo, check this one.

30:37.571 --> 30:41.004
Hey, has anyone ever told you you
look like a Manson Family reject?

30:41.006 --> 30:43.506
Has anyone ever told you
to eat a dick?

30:44.272 --> 30:46.172
What the fuck
you just say to me?

30:46.439 --> 30:47.970
Hey, shit-eyes,

30:47.972 --> 30:49.169
how about respecting
the old personal space, huh?

30:49.171 --> 30:50.937
Siouxie Sioux.

30:50.939 --> 30:54.104
Get ahold of your dog, man.

30:54.106 --> 30:56.670
- I don't like this fucking dog.
- Let's get out of here.

30:56.672 --> 30:58.403
I don't think
she likes you either.

30:58.405 --> 31:00.205
Good fight, though, guys.

31:00.207 --> 31:03.437
- Good girl.
- Thanks. That was sweet of you.

31:03.439 --> 31:05.371
- Benny.
- I'm Mia.

31:05.373 --> 31:09.105
- This is Siouxie Sioux.
- Oh, hey, Siouxie Sioux.

31:09.107 --> 31:12.405
Oh, thank you too, girl.

31:12.407 --> 31:13.870
I love your hatchet.

31:13.872 --> 31:15.571
It's just like the ones
that the Franks used

31:15.573 --> 31:17.106
to defeat the Roman Empire.

31:17.108 --> 31:18.972
Really?
I love French fries.

31:18.974 --> 31:20.974
- I love French fries too.
- Yeah?

31:22.374 --> 31:26.305
What a day. We ran out of beer,
corn dogs and toilet paper.

31:26.307 --> 31:29.172
- In that order.
- That's right.

31:29.174 --> 31:30.940
Rodney, why don't you
send the bank

31:30.942 --> 31:33.139
a nice fat installment
on our loan?

31:33.141 --> 31:35.439
Well, there's a little more
to it than that, D.C.,

31:35.441 --> 31:37.373
but, yeah,
I'll take care of it.

31:37.375 --> 31:38.808
Great.

31:45.474 --> 31:48.007
Here. I was just coming
to show you this.

31:50.008 --> 31:52.840
- Barry Manilow?
- No, no. The Clash.

31:52.842 --> 31:55.739
Oh, yeah, these blokes.

31:55.741 --> 31:57.975
So can we still go?

31:58.941 --> 32:01.908
Yeah, all right.
I reckon why the hell not?

32:02.807 --> 32:06.506
Hey, D.C.! D.C.!

32:06.508 --> 32:08.741
Oh, hell.

32:15.042 --> 32:16.475
Stop it.

32:19.175 --> 32:23.875
D.C., Lost and Found
is for sunglasses, flip-flops.

32:23.877 --> 32:25.941
Not little kids, OK?

32:25.943 --> 32:28.775
Their brothers and sisters just dump
them here and run off to the rides.

32:28.777 --> 32:30.209
OK, just calm down.

32:30.211 --> 32:31.841
We just need to figure out
something to do

32:31.843 --> 32:33.243
with these little bastards.

32:33.477 --> 32:36.744
Animals. I used to love
that petting zoo you took me to.

32:37.277 --> 32:40.241
Maybe we can do a Kiddieland
with a petting zoo.

32:40.243 --> 32:41.874
- Yeah.
- Killer's got snakes.

32:41.876 --> 32:44.509
- Oh, well...
- Hey, you like snakes?

32:48.344 --> 32:50.275
You're not gonna
catch anything.

32:50.277 --> 32:52.409
You're not gonna catch anything.
You're a pussy.

32:52.411 --> 32:54.111
That has nothing to do
with catching.

32:54.510 --> 32:56.309
Are you sure
peanut butter's a good idea?

32:56.311 --> 33:00.075
Absolutely. Just go to sleep
with your eyes open

33:00.077 --> 33:01.809
and say
whatever's on your mind.

33:01.811 --> 33:03.143
Yeah.

33:03.145 --> 33:04.643
Is it near me
right now?

33:04.645 --> 33:07.809
He's coming this way.
What, are you scared, Pete?

33:07.811 --> 33:10.242
Yes, I'm terrified.

33:10.244 --> 33:11.844
You look really brave.

33:11.846 --> 33:15.109
- Eat the peanut butter.
- Oh, he's coming.

33:15.111 --> 33:16.976
Grab him. Grab him.

33:16.978 --> 33:19.345
He just dragged his nuts
across your face, Pete.

33:24.079 --> 33:26.076
Cage. Give me the cage.

33:26.078 --> 33:28.145
Give me the cage.

33:32.479 --> 33:33.613
Shit.

33:34.680 --> 33:36.244
It's a porcupine.

33:36.246 --> 33:38.613
It comes from the Middle French
word meaning "thorny pig."

33:39.913 --> 33:41.113
Hold my beer.

33:42.546 --> 33:44.613
You need to charm him,
like a lady.

33:45.145 --> 33:48.312
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

33:48.314 --> 33:50.581
Put him in the bucket.
Put him in the bucket.

33:51.080 --> 33:53.078
Come on. In. In, in, in.

33:53.080 --> 33:55.610
Ow!

33:55.612 --> 33:59.581
I'm going to just slip one in
in case the squirrel's frisky.

34:01.647 --> 34:03.380
Just stay relaxed.

34:05.014 --> 34:06.848
Here. Lookee here.

34:07.179 --> 34:08.578
Yeah. Wait, wait.

34:08.580 --> 34:12.215
There's more where
that came from. Lookee here.

34:12.681 --> 34:15.777
- Shh. Fucking shut up.
- Dude, it's in.

34:15.780 --> 34:18.414
Ow! Ow. Ow.

34:19.480 --> 34:21.579
Dude, he likes it.
That's disgusting.

34:21.581 --> 34:24.445
Give me the bag.
It's totally in your pants.

34:24.447 --> 34:25.880
Hold it in there.
Just trap it.

34:26.481 --> 34:29.179
Drop it. He'll take it.
Don't give him a fright.

34:29.748 --> 34:32.246
- Stand up slow.
- I am, I am.

34:32.248 --> 34:34.545
- He's moving.
- Shh, shh, shh.

34:34.547 --> 34:36.978
Ow. Ow. Goddamn.

34:39.313 --> 34:41.980
- D.C.
- Oh, we got it!

34:41.982 --> 34:43.914
- Yeah, baby!
- Nice job, Benny.

34:43.916 --> 34:45.112
Don't let it out.

34:45.114 --> 34:48.045
- OK.
- No peeking. You peeking?

34:48.047 --> 34:50.114
- No, they're closed.
- Keep 'em closed.

34:50.116 --> 34:53.748
All right, and... voilà!

34:53.750 --> 34:56.250
Kiddieland!

34:57.948 --> 35:00.282
Oh! Um...

35:02.850 --> 35:05.215
It's not exactly how I saw it.

35:05.217 --> 35:07.450
Are you kidding?
It's fantastic.

35:08.149 --> 35:10.914
- Oh, my God! Don't touch it.
- Sorry.

35:10.916 --> 35:12.116
Dad.

35:13.715 --> 35:15.217
Lookee here.

35:16.150 --> 35:18.315
Where did you
find all this?

35:18.317 --> 35:20.881
Well, I bought some
and caught some.

35:20.883 --> 35:24.216
- That's really dangerous.
- No, no, he's in full control.

35:24.218 --> 35:25.617
He's in control.

35:27.016 --> 35:28.416
All right.

35:30.684 --> 35:31.785
Children...

35:32.250 --> 35:36.750
Boogie. Hey.
You wanna hold one?

35:36.752 --> 35:38.182
I'm fine, thanks.

35:38.184 --> 35:40.419
He sure has a way
with kids, don't he?

35:47.518 --> 35:50.182
Channel 7 News.
You're speaking to Mia.

35:50.184 --> 35:51.582
I'm looking to buy a merkin.

35:51.584 --> 35:53.751
It's one of them wigs
for your vagina.

35:54.351 --> 35:57.215
Benny. I'm at work.

35:58.784 --> 36:01.115
- <i>Hey, hey! Ho, ho!</i>
- Oh, here it is, here it is.

36:01.117 --> 36:02.716
<i>Action Point has got...</i>

36:02.718 --> 36:06.552
- <i>You look like Sean Connery.</i>
- Thanks, baby. You're so sweet.

36:07.851 --> 36:11.083
Oh, shit. Here comes
my dickhead boss. I gotta go.

36:11.085 --> 36:13.319
- Big hugs.
- Bye. Bye.

36:14.251 --> 36:16.085
Watch out!

36:21.985 --> 36:23.617
Look at those two nestlecocks.

36:23.619 --> 36:26.984
That's like the tenth 7 Parks
T-shirt I've seen this week.

36:26.986 --> 36:29.285
Who's shitting
down whose chimney now?

36:29.287 --> 36:30.685
Wait a second.

36:30.687 --> 36:33.452
Damn it, Benny.
That's my bottle.

36:35.519 --> 36:36.786
I'm sorry.

36:38.620 --> 36:42.322
Mmm, there. Hit it
at the bottom of the ball.

36:43.818 --> 36:45.353
Really pop...

36:50.620 --> 36:53.254
- Are you OK?
- I'm good.

36:57.820 --> 37:00.153
- Hello?
- <i>Hey, Dad.</i>

37:00.155 --> 37:03.085
Oh, hey, Boogie.
How's the wedding?

37:03.087 --> 37:06.085
<i>Oh, it's beautiful. It's on the lake.
It's so pretty.</i>

37:06.087 --> 37:08.452
Oh, sounds absolutely lovely.

37:08.454 --> 37:11.953
- <i>So, did you guys go out?</i>
- No, haven't left the den.

37:11.955 --> 37:15.152
Just telling Rudie about
the old times in Action Point.

37:15.154 --> 37:17.152
- <i>Dad.</i>
- Oh, she's fine.

37:17.154 --> 37:19.419
She's never been so safe
in her whole life.

37:19.421 --> 37:21.252
Duct-taped her to the couch.

37:21.254 --> 37:23.720
<i>OK, Dad, we're about to leave,
so I will see you soon, OK?</i>

37:23.722 --> 37:27.621
All right. Well, bring us
some cake. Talk soon.

37:28.621 --> 37:31.152
Mom doesn't like you
talking about Action Point?

37:31.154 --> 37:33.419
<i>Nah, she loved Action Point.</i>

37:33.421 --> 37:36.187
<i>But the irony is
it was her idea</i>

37:36.189 --> 37:37.720
<i>that got the park shut down.</i>

37:37.722 --> 37:40.619
<i>Yeah, Knoblach got word
of the petting zoo,</i>

37:40.621 --> 37:43.319
<i>so he sicced
the state inspectors on us.</i>

37:43.321 --> 37:45.754
I'm sorry. You do not have
a permit for a petting zoo.

37:45.756 --> 37:48.887
It's not a petting zoo.
It's an animal refuge.

37:48.889 --> 37:53.423
Raccoons, crocodiles, snakes.
They are not protected animals.

37:54.256 --> 37:56.755
I have to close you down.

37:56.757 --> 37:58.791
- The entire park?
- Yep.

38:00.456 --> 38:03.524
This is an outrage.
An outrage!

38:04.957 --> 38:06.689
Shit!

38:06.691 --> 38:10.124
That's it. We're closed down.

38:32.324 --> 38:37.321
All right. We'll have this place
back up and running in no time.

38:37.323 --> 38:40.089
Keep moving,
you magnificent sons of bitches.

38:40.091 --> 38:43.356
Yo. Got your, uh, supplies.

38:43.358 --> 38:44.923
Well, let's do it.

38:44.925 --> 38:47.555
<i>So we patched
a few holes around the park</i>

38:47.557 --> 38:51.225
<i>and hatched a plan to capture
my neighbor, the boozy bear.</i>

39:01.625 --> 39:04.326
That a boy.
That a boy.

39:16.126 --> 39:17.659
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

39:19.993 --> 39:23.961
We got him. We got him.

39:25.458 --> 39:27.392
Good bear. Good boy.

39:27.394 --> 39:29.494
D.C., I think he's drunk.

39:31.759 --> 39:34.625
"Oh, let me get the door
for you, boss.

39:34.627 --> 39:38.124
Oh, oh, boss, boss,
your forgot your briefcase."

39:38.126 --> 39:40.258
Poor old Ron.

39:40.260 --> 39:42.924
If I ordered a whole truckload
of pompous pricks

39:42.926 --> 39:46.359
and they only sent Knoblach,
I'd pay for the shipment.

39:46.361 --> 39:50.758
Hey, welcome back, boys.
Good to see you.

39:50.760 --> 39:51.992
- Ron.
- D.C.

39:51.994 --> 39:54.994
Lobcock,
my bossy little bottom.

39:56.726 --> 39:58.860
The mayor himself
asked me to attend,

39:58.862 --> 40:01.459
make sure the good people
of the city are kept safe.

40:01.461 --> 40:02.959
Oh, OK.

40:02.961 --> 40:04.993
Kind of like how he's safely
tucked up the mayor's ass?

40:04.995 --> 40:08.259
- Uh-huh.
- All right, this way, fellas.

40:08.261 --> 40:10.260
- Morning.
- Morning.

40:10.262 --> 40:11.992
Show you around
the new, improved,

40:11.994 --> 40:14.328
safe and up-to-code
Action Point.

40:19.094 --> 40:21.394
Well, I still see a petting zoo.

40:21.396 --> 40:23.263
Killer, if you will.

40:31.496 --> 40:32.894
You have a bear?

40:32.896 --> 40:34.660
Yes, sir.
A genuine brown bear.

40:34.662 --> 40:37.428
Which falls under
the protected class of animals.

40:41.297 --> 40:44.260
Half your park gets
shut down over safety concerns,

40:44.262 --> 40:47.662
and you think a loop-dee-loop
will pass inspection?

40:47.664 --> 40:49.694
I don't know.
Is there anything on the books

40:49.696 --> 40:52.628
prohibiting
a 360-degree loop-dee-loop?

40:52.630 --> 40:54.993
- I think it's inventive.
- This is bullshit!

40:54.995 --> 40:58.030
This can't be legal.
This is not safe.

41:03.230 --> 41:06.061
Oh, poor Stopcock.
Him's got wet.

41:07.796 --> 41:11.062
By the way, you shit waffle,
guess what? We're here to stay.

41:11.064 --> 41:13.961
I ain't leaving this park
for you or anybody!

41:13.963 --> 41:17.797
"It's not
safe." Oh, did you see his face?

41:22.932 --> 41:24.931
My friends.

41:25.798 --> 41:28.497
Do you guys know
what time it is?

41:31.498 --> 41:34.732
One, two, three.

41:46.199 --> 41:48.597
Hey, D.C.

41:48.599 --> 41:52.397
What? Oh, what are you
sulking about?

41:52.399 --> 41:56.132
I just got off the phone with
our loan officer at the bank.

42:03.198 --> 42:04.363
And?

42:04.365 --> 42:05.997
They're calling
the rest of the loan.

42:05.999 --> 42:09.398
We owe them the remainder and
he called it a balloon payment.

42:09.400 --> 42:12.997
A what? Can they even do that?

42:12.999 --> 42:14.797
They just did it.

42:14.799 --> 42:17.700
How much time do we got?

42:18.433 --> 42:20.099
Ten business days.

42:22.133 --> 42:24.732
Fucking Knoblach
and his buddies at the bank.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.866
We're gonna have to make
a real push here. I mean...

42:29.868 --> 42:32.865
We're already getting all the locals.
Everyone knows about us.

42:32.867 --> 42:34.965
Everyone in town knows about us,

42:34.967 --> 42:38.165
but we're gonna have to start pulling
'em in from other parts of the state.

42:38.167 --> 42:42.333
But don't worry,
I got this, all right?

42:42.335 --> 42:44.568
It's gonna be fine.

42:45.068 --> 42:46.832
Shit.

42:46.834 --> 42:48.431
- Ow!
- Shit!

42:48.433 --> 42:51.301
Damn it! Fix that, Rodney.

42:52.101 --> 42:55.165
<i>Once again a blow
to the head gave me clarity</i>

42:55.167 --> 42:57.165
<i>where there was once none.</i>

42:57.167 --> 42:59.366
<i>I had an idea.</i>

43:00.534 --> 43:02.603
Action Point commercial.
Take one.

43:03.302 --> 43:06.866
All right, everyone in the
go-karts, let's haul some ass.

43:06.868 --> 43:08.366
Action!

43:08.368 --> 43:10.567
Race like a pro at Action Point.

43:10.569 --> 43:12.999
This time try not to sound like a little bitch.

43:13.001 --> 43:14.300
Ow!

43:14.302 --> 43:15.934
Action!

43:15.936 --> 43:19.035
Action Point is the greatest
place to bring your kids.

43:20.535 --> 43:22.466
Oh, Jesus.

43:22.468 --> 43:24.268
Oh, my goodness.

43:24.270 --> 43:27.767
- Great job, Gerber.
- Do not look over there, OK?

43:27.769 --> 43:29.702
You're not gonna tell Mommy
about this, OK?

43:29.704 --> 43:33.435
Are you ready, Rodney? 'Cause
he's already had a 12-pack today.

43:33.437 --> 43:34.904
He's getting a little grumpy.

43:36.236 --> 43:39.635
These are the greatest rides
in the whole world.

43:39.637 --> 43:41.568
Whoo-hoo!

43:41.570 --> 43:44.067
I love this place.

43:44.069 --> 43:46.103
Hit it.

43:50.102 --> 43:52.602
Attaboy.

43:52.604 --> 43:55.902
OK. Can we get in
closer together?

43:55.904 --> 43:58.802
We love Action Point!

43:58.804 --> 44:01.669
- Glasses.
- Glasses? OK, right.

44:01.671 --> 44:04.071
- Rodney!
- Shut up. He's gonna do it.

44:11.737 --> 44:15.271
Way to go, Rodney!
Can he swim?

44:16.071 --> 44:17.937
That key is for the back door.

44:17.939 --> 44:20.468
The room you wanna get into
is that window right there.

44:20.470 --> 44:22.671
- All right.
- Got it.

44:23.472 --> 44:25.539
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

44:27.272 --> 44:29.506
See you, Siouxie Sioux.

44:31.338 --> 44:33.572
- Psst. D.C.
- What?

44:36.804 --> 44:39.871
- Maybe I should do this.
- Why?

44:39.873 --> 44:41.538
First of all,

44:41.540 --> 44:43.504
you don't need to be getting
arrested in front of Boogie.

44:43.506 --> 44:46.271
Second of all?
Mia's watching.

44:46.273 --> 44:49.273
And it turns her on
when I butch it up.

44:50.973 --> 44:54.540
OK, buddy.
But don't fuck this up, OK?

44:55.205 --> 44:58.307
You gotta get in there fast
and locate the room.

45:00.240 --> 45:02.470
And when you find it,

45:02.472 --> 45:06.139
do the old Texas switch
with our commercial, all right?

45:06.141 --> 45:08.174
- Yeah.
- OK.

45:10.241 --> 45:13.107
This is the key. Look.
This is the key.

45:15.106 --> 45:18.506
Most of all, Benny,
stay focused.

45:19.140 --> 45:22.307
- I won't let you down, D.C.
- OK.

45:26.307 --> 45:28.775
You dropped the keys.

45:30.341 --> 45:32.574
Sorry.

45:36.141 --> 45:38.575
There goes a brave man.

45:41.975 --> 45:44.739
Jesus Christ.

45:44.741 --> 45:48.208
Easy, Siouxie Sioux.
He'll be back.

45:49.642 --> 45:51.339
Studio Three...

45:55.442 --> 45:56.742
Studio Three.

46:04.042 --> 46:05.473
Go on.

46:31.543 --> 46:33.809
He's totally got this.

46:35.711 --> 46:38.875
Oh, shit. Get down.

46:38.877 --> 46:40.808
Shit. Get down.

46:40.810 --> 46:44.008
- Who is that?
- Oh, shit.

46:44.010 --> 46:45.977
That's Lyle, our anchorman.

46:46.810 --> 46:49.842
And our drunken weathergirl,
Margie.

46:49.844 --> 46:52.212
Get down.
Hey, Siouxie Sioux, lay down.

47:43.813 --> 47:45.411
Shit.

47:49.912 --> 47:52.011
God. Jesus.

47:54.579 --> 47:57.445
There he is.
There he is. Go, go, go, go, go.

47:57.447 --> 48:02.511
- Oh! Come on, Benny!
- Go, go, go, go! Go, go, go!

48:02.513 --> 48:04.480
Come on.

48:05.846 --> 48:08.081
Go, go, go!

48:10.581 --> 48:12.480
Siouxie, no!

48:14.814 --> 48:18.047
<i>Schlitz Light, the beer that has
less calories, is less filling...</i>

48:18.049 --> 48:20.412
Rodney, when's this shit
coming on, man?

48:20.414 --> 48:23.012
Here it comes. Here it comes.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

48:23.014 --> 48:24.447
<i>Action Point!</i>

48:26.415 --> 48:29.148
<i>Race like a pro
at Action Point.</i>

48:32.481 --> 48:35.749
<i>These are the greatest rides
in the whole world.</i>

48:36.415 --> 48:39.213
<i>Come to Action Point
and get a free season's pass</i>

48:39.215 --> 48:40.614
<i>with the price of admission.</i>

48:41.683 --> 48:44.113
<i>Cheers!</i>

48:44.115 --> 48:46.881
Shut up!

48:46.883 --> 48:49.547
<i>We love Action Point!</i>

48:52.449 --> 48:54.212
Son of a...

49:09.317 --> 49:10.284
Come on.

49:15.282 --> 49:17.049
Welcome to Action Point.

49:41.285 --> 49:43.949
- I can't do this.
- Yeah. Yeah, you can.

49:43.951 --> 49:47.050
You want that car or not?
Come on, be a man.

49:47.052 --> 49:49.816
- Are you a Knoblach or not?
- Knoblach.

49:49.818 --> 49:51.549
Go the extra mile.

49:57.418 --> 50:00.451
- I hope he gets hurt.
- Totally.

50:02.886 --> 50:05.951
It's so sore. It's so sore.

50:05.953 --> 50:08.849
- Does it hurt?
- It hurts. Obviously it hurts.

50:08.851 --> 50:10.184
- Jesus.
- Right there?

50:10.186 --> 50:12.419
No! Don't touch it.

50:13.152 --> 50:14.917
- God.
- This way.

50:14.919 --> 50:17.152
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

50:18.385 --> 50:20.318
You gotta learn
to hold on, Trav,

50:20.320 --> 50:23.885
or you're gonna keep
falling off all the rides.

50:23.887 --> 50:26.120
Go away.

50:33.187 --> 50:35.954
- Oh, shit.
- Dude. Lumpy, Jesus.

50:36.652 --> 50:38.284
Gotta go. It's time to go.

50:38.286 --> 50:42.450
All right, see you tomorrow,
you drunk bastards.

50:42.452 --> 50:46.084
- Today was insane.
- Crazy.

50:46.086 --> 50:49.619
We're actually gonna make it. By about
noon Monday, that loan is paid off.

50:49.621 --> 50:50.887
Hah!

50:52.021 --> 50:55.953
- Long live Action Point.
- D'shawn Chico Carver?

50:55.955 --> 50:57.488
Who?

50:58.488 --> 51:01.588
- D'shawn Chico Carver.
- I'm D.C.

51:03.720 --> 51:06.618
- Who are you?
- Joel Green.

51:06.620 --> 51:09.454
Joel Green and Associates.

51:10.455 --> 51:13.321
All right, why don't you
give me a minute?

51:16.488 --> 51:19.719
I am serving you with papers.

51:19.721 --> 51:23.087
You are being sued for running a
reckless and dangerous establishment

51:23.089 --> 51:24.986
by one Gregory Knoblach.

51:24.988 --> 51:26.385
I believe his son was injured

51:26.387 --> 51:28.954
on one of your rides
just this morning.

51:29.555 --> 51:33.422
Damn, Joel,
you got here awfully quick.

51:34.656 --> 51:36.752
Smell a rat.

51:36.754 --> 51:39.821
Well, you're welcome to prove
those allegations in court.

51:39.823 --> 51:43.653
Also be advised my client is
willing to hear settlement offers.

51:43.655 --> 51:45.489
Here's my card.

51:47.090 --> 51:49.323
Think it over, huh?

52:01.424 --> 52:04.487
- How much did he want?
- Two million dollars.

52:04.489 --> 52:07.454
And I knew this was just the tip
of the tort iceberg

52:07.456 --> 52:09.588
and there'd be
more claims and lawsuits

52:09.590 --> 52:12.020
and jackhole attorneys
coming around.

52:12.022 --> 52:13.289
So what'd you do?

52:16.123 --> 52:17.723
Whoo!

52:17.725 --> 52:20.854
<i>Well, Papaw still
had some screwing up to do.</i>

52:46.392 --> 52:48.789
- Hey, Dad, you ready to go?
- One second, baby. Sorry.

52:48.791 --> 52:52.092
I'm just... I gotta
figure this stuff out or...

52:53.193 --> 52:55.123
But I thought tonight
we were gonna...

52:55.125 --> 52:59.593
Baby, I'm sorry.
I got a lot.

53:02.191 --> 53:04.626
Is that a new look for you?

53:05.427 --> 53:09.924
Yeah. Yeah, just...
I'm just trying it out.

53:09.926 --> 53:12.159
Right.

53:23.925 --> 53:26.159
Shit.

53:39.593 --> 53:41.824
- Where is she?
- Hey!

53:41.826 --> 53:43.925
- Boogie!
- Boogie!

53:43.927 --> 53:46.325
- Whoo-whoo!
- Hey, Boogie!

53:46.327 --> 53:48.359
Get in, get in, get in!

53:48.361 --> 53:50.692
Come on, Boogie,
let's go.

53:50.694 --> 53:53.527
- Boogie!
- All right!

53:53.529 --> 53:55.925
- Whoo!
- Let's go!

53:55.927 --> 53:58.161
Yeah!

54:00.828 --> 54:02.826
This is my security device.

54:04.361 --> 54:07.825
- Can I have a beer, please?
- Yeah, beer me, beer me.

54:07.827 --> 54:09.861
- Beer, please.
- Hey, can I have one?

54:10.796 --> 54:12.527
I don't know, Boogie.

54:12.529 --> 54:15.129
<i>...less calories, is
less filling and yet has great taste.</i>

54:16.163 --> 54:17.397
One.

54:18.562 --> 54:20.596
OK.

54:24.728 --> 54:27.226
- Oh!
- Here we go. Attagirl.

54:31.430 --> 54:33.897
- Cheers.
- Yeah!

55:01.963 --> 55:04.130
What the f...

55:04.664 --> 55:07.761
Ha-ha-ha.
It's the Action Point pussies.

55:07.763 --> 55:10.196
Hey, just give 'em back,
all right, man?

55:10.198 --> 55:12.394
Take 'em.

55:12.396 --> 55:15.729
Seriously. Um... OK.

55:15.731 --> 55:17.695
- Yeah? You want 'em?
- Yeah.

55:17.697 --> 55:20.063
Fuck off.

55:20.065 --> 55:22.429
Circus freaks.

55:22.431 --> 55:24.229
Watch your...

55:24.231 --> 55:27.662
Annie, no, it's cool. What are you doing?
Let go of her.

55:27.664 --> 55:30.396
You gonna fucking push me,
asshole? Hit me.

55:30.398 --> 55:33.364
- Come on, hit me, asshole.
- Travis, get him.

55:33.366 --> 55:35.698
Get off!

55:37.397 --> 55:39.497
- Hey, let's go!
- Right, let's break it up!

55:39.499 --> 55:43.762
Get your hands on the hood now.
Get over here.

55:43.764 --> 55:47.030
- Do you know who my dad is?
- Hands on the hood.

55:47.032 --> 55:48.830
Out of the car, now.

55:48.832 --> 55:50.366
Get over here. Let me
see your hands on the hood.

55:52.899 --> 55:56.932
You're such a fucking
disappointment. Look at me.

55:58.333 --> 56:00.666
- D.C.
- Wilhoit.

56:03.533 --> 56:05.699
You're free.

56:06.532 --> 56:08.766
They sure grow up fast.

56:13.400 --> 56:14.967
Sneak out on me, huh?

56:16.433 --> 56:19.564
- What do you care?
- Excuse me?

56:19.566 --> 56:22.631
You're always so busy
with your precious park.

56:22.633 --> 56:24.297
Always so distracted.

56:24.299 --> 56:27.166
I mean, you can't even do
one single thing that I like.

56:27.168 --> 56:30.531
That's not true.
I enjoy doing things you like.

56:30.533 --> 56:33.568
Except going
to the Clash concert, right?

56:35.568 --> 56:37.635
Shit. Did I...

56:40.934 --> 56:42.567
I'm sorry, Boogie.

56:44.734 --> 56:47.568
You sorry that you never come
to New York?

56:49.534 --> 56:51.969
Kind of think
you're only so sorry.

56:54.902 --> 56:56.766
Which is fine,

56:56.768 --> 57:00.469
because the podiatrist
wants to be my guardian.

57:02.968 --> 57:05.734
All you gotta do
is sign the papers.

57:06.201 --> 57:10.766
What? What...
What are you talking about?

57:10.768 --> 57:15.533
Do you think I'm gonna let some
short-timer boyfriend of your mother's

57:15.535 --> 57:17.800
become your guardian?

57:17.802 --> 57:20.867
They've been together
for four years, Dad.

57:20.869 --> 57:26.933
He is a positive m...
male influ... influence.

57:28.502 --> 57:30.900
- Baby.
- Get off me.

57:30.902 --> 57:32.969
It's OK.

57:35.070 --> 57:37.104
Jesus. It's all right.

57:40.870 --> 57:43.204
What the hell are you
guys calling this thing?

57:43.436 --> 57:45.034
A trebo what?

57:45.036 --> 57:47.336
A trebuchet.
It was used to besiege castles.

57:47.338 --> 57:51.469
Personally I prefer a small bomb the
French invented called a petard.

57:51.471 --> 57:53.368
"Petard" is the French word
for "fart."

57:53.370 --> 57:57.070
It's a catapult. It's gonna
get everybody talking again.

57:57.072 --> 58:00.201
- 7 Parks ain't got this.
- D.C., this is fucked, OK?

58:00.203 --> 58:04.002
I mean, this is gonna be tricky
at best. That pool's tiny.

58:04.004 --> 58:06.234
It's the worst idea
for an attraction.

58:06.236 --> 58:07.501
It's not an attraction.

58:07.503 --> 58:09.069
It's a stunt we can charge
admission for.

58:09.071 --> 58:12.703
We're gonna make a bundle.
Let's see what this baby can do.

58:14.770 --> 58:17.138
You guys
ready down there?

58:19.338 --> 58:21.569
Oh, shit!

58:21.571 --> 58:24.072
- Whoa! Wrong way!
- Shit.

58:26.972 --> 58:29.007
Oh, shit.

58:29.872 --> 58:32.539
- Come on!
- Shit, shit.

58:35.605 --> 58:38.003
Fuck. Fuck. Oh, shit.

58:38.005 --> 58:40.403
- He's all right. He's OK.
- Oh, my God.

58:42.739 --> 58:45.203
Gonna have to noodle
on that one a little more.

58:45.205 --> 58:49.472
- Sorry, D.C.
- Well, hey, it worked. Yeah?

58:50.106 --> 58:51.773
Hey, Boogie Bear.

58:53.374 --> 58:55.607
Sweetie?

59:00.238 --> 59:02.039
Shit. Chickenbutt.

59:04.106 --> 59:06.670
Boogie's gone.
So's her luggage.

59:06.672 --> 59:09.672
There's 300 dollars missing
from the Snack Shack.

59:09.674 --> 59:11.807
I only took 200.

59:12.506 --> 59:14.604
- Where's she headed?
- I don't know.

59:14.606 --> 59:17.907
New York. Home.

59:40.908 --> 59:42.574
Shit.

59:47.208 --> 59:49.108
I'm sorry.

59:52.776 --> 59:55.140
Excuse me, ma'am.
I'm looking for my daughter.

59:55.142 --> 59:57.207
She's 14 years old.
Her name is Boogie...

59:57.209 --> 01:00:01.074
- Long hair? Pissed off?
- Yeah. Has she been here?

01:00:01.076 --> 01:00:03.708
- I'm sure she has.
- Why do you say that?

01:00:03.710 --> 01:00:05.573
Because
this is called a bus station.

01:00:05.575 --> 01:00:07.341
All we have here
are runaway daughters

01:00:07.343 --> 01:00:08.807
and the fathers
that are looking for 'em.

01:00:08.809 --> 01:00:11.040
Rebecca!

01:00:11.042 --> 01:00:14.741
Oh, the last bus that left here,
where was it going?

01:00:14.743 --> 01:00:17.674
- East. Eastbound.
- Eastbound to where?

01:00:17.676 --> 01:00:20.575
- Next!
- No, no, no. Eastbound to...

01:00:20.577 --> 01:00:22.575
- Watch out. What the...
- Psst.

01:00:22.577 --> 01:00:24.809
Hey, man.

01:00:25.942 --> 01:00:27.941
I think I saw the girl
you're looking for.

01:00:27.943 --> 01:00:30.475
She was on the last eastbound.

01:00:30.477 --> 01:00:32.674
I think it was headed
towards Vegas.

01:00:32.676 --> 01:00:34.709
- Vegas?
- Yeah.

01:00:34.711 --> 01:00:37.041
- Oh. Thank you.
- You bet, buddy.

01:00:37.043 --> 01:00:38.742
- Hey. Thank you.
- Yeah, good luck.

01:00:38.744 --> 01:00:40.577
Vegas.

01:00:45.277 --> 01:00:48.809
In the 1930s there was a Hollywood
stagehand called O.K. Freddy,

01:00:48.811 --> 01:00:51.709
and he had a huge tallywacker,

01:00:51.711 --> 01:00:53.775
maybe even bigger
than my grandpa's.

01:00:53.777 --> 01:00:55.976
And when they were
gonna start filming,

01:00:55.978 --> 01:00:57.609
to sort of christen the picture,

01:00:57.611 --> 01:01:00.575
the producers would gather up
all the cast and crew

01:01:00.577 --> 01:01:02.843
and call O.K. Freddy
to the front

01:01:02.845 --> 01:01:04.577
and they'd shout, "O.K. Freddy!"

01:01:04.579 --> 01:01:06.177
And he'd pull out his dong,

01:01:06.179 --> 01:01:08.076
shake it around
a couple of times

01:01:08.078 --> 01:01:10.309
and then
they could start filming.

01:01:11.745 --> 01:01:13.946
All right.

01:01:14.611 --> 01:01:16.078
Well, when I was a kid,

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:18.976
I had an English bulldog
that I called O.K. Freddy,

01:01:18.978 --> 01:01:24.109
and one day he ran away
and it felt horrible.

01:01:24.111 --> 01:01:27.377
But then we found him
right alongside the road

01:01:27.379 --> 01:01:29.046
and we were happy again.

01:01:30.579 --> 01:01:34.314
Before we could get to him,
he got hit by a truck.

01:01:35.879 --> 01:01:37.580
Boy, did he fly.

01:01:38.513 --> 01:01:39.978
Why would you tell me that?

01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:42.211
I guess I could have left out
the last part.

01:01:42.213 --> 01:01:43.410
Yeah, I guess.

01:01:43.412 --> 01:01:45.811
Whoa, whoa. I see a bus.

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:51.114
Boogie!

01:01:51.647 --> 01:01:53.812
- Boogie!
- Boogie!

01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:58.479
- -Stop, please!
Hey, yo, pull over!

01:01:58.481 --> 01:02:03.112
Son of a bitch. Here,
let's switch. Let's switch.

01:02:03.114 --> 01:02:05.847
- Take the wheel. Got it?
- Yeah.

01:02:07.548 --> 01:02:09.645
Pull alongside of the bus.

01:02:09.647 --> 01:02:13.447
Boogie! It's Daddy Bear, Boogie!

01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:17.812
Boogie, it's Daddy!
It's Daddy!

01:02:17.814 --> 01:02:20.015
I'm looking for my daughter!
Hey!

01:02:20.848 --> 01:02:24.713
I said open the damn door!

01:02:24.715 --> 01:02:26.713
Open it! Open it!

01:02:26.715 --> 01:02:28.947
Son of a bitch.
The hell with it.

01:02:28.949 --> 01:02:30.678
- Keep it steady.
- Why?

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.112
I'm gonna bust in the damn door.

01:02:32.114 --> 01:02:34.848
- That's stupid.
- Just do what I say.

01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:39.648
One... two...

01:02:45.049 --> 01:02:47.515
Just get out
of the damn driver's seat.

01:02:48.316 --> 01:02:52.213
Idiot! Unbelievable.
What the hell were you doing?

01:02:52.215 --> 01:02:55.547
- I was vehiculating.
- What?

01:02:55.549 --> 01:02:57.146
They're getting away. Come on.

01:02:57.148 --> 01:02:59.114
You were supposed
to hold it in the road.

01:02:59.116 --> 01:03:02.082
Come on, come on, come on.

01:03:02.084 --> 01:03:04.214
When did you last
get this thing serviced, D.C.?

01:03:04.216 --> 01:03:05.949
- Come on.
- Probably never.

01:03:07.016 --> 01:03:11.915
- Think she was on that bus?
- Ah. Probably not.

01:03:11.917 --> 01:03:13.747
We lost 'em anyway.

01:03:13.749 --> 01:03:16.881
- Well, now what?
- I don't know.

01:03:16.883 --> 01:03:19.514
Wait a second. I might know.

01:03:30.516 --> 01:03:32.881
Is that her?

01:03:32.883 --> 01:03:35.119
Yeah, that's her.

01:03:47.384 --> 01:03:48.717
Hey, Chickenbutt.

01:04:00.451 --> 01:04:02.849
When you were two years old,

01:04:02.851 --> 01:04:06.218
I told your mom I wanted
to freeze you at that age.

01:04:07.318 --> 01:04:13.953
You were so cute with those
big eyes, and... so innocent.

01:04:15.385 --> 01:04:16.985
How's that supposed
to make me feel?

01:04:16.987 --> 01:04:19.283
Like it's not OK to grow up?

01:04:19.285 --> 01:04:20.783
No, it's just...

01:04:20.785 --> 01:04:25.353
Well, with myself I'm pretty
free from fear, but...

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:32.451
with you I get scared.

01:04:32.453 --> 01:04:34.185
Then why do you do it?

01:04:34.187 --> 01:04:37.453
Why are you so obsessed
with the park?

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:43.552
When your mom left with you,

01:04:43.554 --> 01:04:48.354
and she had her reasons,
I lost my family.

01:04:50.454 --> 01:04:53.652
I guess the Shitbirds
and the park,

01:04:53.654 --> 01:04:55.888
they became my family.

01:04:58.321 --> 01:05:02.120
And I didn't wanna lose them
like I lost you.

01:05:03.021 --> 01:05:05.720
You... You didn't lose me.

01:05:06.487 --> 01:05:09.753
<i>As we talked,
I realized the reason</i>

01:05:09.755 --> 01:05:11.585
<i>I was so terrified
of her growing up</i>

01:05:11.587 --> 01:05:15.488
<i>is 'cause I hadn't been there
to watch her grow up.</i>

01:05:18.322 --> 01:05:21.619
- Papaw, are you crying?
- No, hell, no.

01:05:21.621 --> 01:05:25.953
I'm... I'm just old, and my eyes
steam over sometimes.

01:05:25.955 --> 01:05:31.155
It's a side effect of Cialis.
That's Papaw's heart medication.

01:05:32.255 --> 01:05:34.655
So what happened
to Action Point?

01:05:34.657 --> 01:05:37.020
Action Point was doomed.

01:05:37.022 --> 01:05:39.154
It couldn't exist today
in the nanny state

01:05:39.156 --> 01:05:40.788
with all the helicopter parents.

01:05:40.790 --> 01:05:44.090
No way.
I just had to accept reality.

01:05:45.356 --> 01:05:47.786
<i>I didn't have enough money
to pay off the lawyers,</i>

01:05:47.788 --> 01:05:50.420
<i>and, well, the talk with
your mom got me to thinking.</i>

01:05:50.422 --> 01:05:54.588
<i>So I did what
any reasonable man would do.</i>

01:05:54.590 --> 01:05:56.057
<i>I blew the whole thing up.</i>

01:05:57.657 --> 01:06:00.688
- We had a damn good run.
- Get out of the way. Get out of the way.

01:06:00.690 --> 01:06:04.956
Get the hell out of my way.
Move it. Move your ass.

01:06:04.958 --> 01:06:07.154
There's fucking Knoblick
and his lawyer.

01:06:07.156 --> 01:06:08.988
Fucking lawyers.

01:06:08.990 --> 01:06:11.588
That's the injury?
Looks like a sprain.

01:06:11.590 --> 01:06:13.921
It didn't look like that
the other night.

01:06:13.923 --> 01:06:16.356
Open up! Yoo-hoo! Anybody home?

01:06:17.823 --> 01:06:20.455
- Morning, Slobcock.
- Boogie.

01:06:20.457 --> 01:06:24.423
- Oh.
- Why didn't I think of that?

01:06:25.057 --> 01:06:27.289
Well, guess you got my message.

01:06:27.291 --> 01:06:30.190
Yes, I did, and I am very happy

01:06:30.192 --> 01:06:32.357
you decided not to delay
the inevitable.

01:06:32.359 --> 01:06:36.624
I hope you brought the title
to Action Point.

01:06:57.860 --> 01:06:59.589
I made a lot of mistakes
in my life,

01:06:59.591 --> 01:07:01.723
but I never hurt my kid
on purpose.

01:07:01.725 --> 01:07:04.323
Ah, well, thank you.

01:07:04.325 --> 01:07:07.992
He's buying me a Z28, so...

01:07:12.225 --> 01:07:14.024
Come on, let's go.

01:07:14.026 --> 01:07:15.392
You can just put an X

01:07:15.394 --> 01:07:17.226
if you don't remember
how to spell your name.

01:07:19.293 --> 01:07:21.527
No, no. What's he doing?

01:07:24.727 --> 01:07:27.359
Sure is a lot of people
out front.

01:07:27.361 --> 01:07:31.492
For God's sake, D.C.,
just sign the damn thing.

01:07:31.494 --> 01:07:34.727
All right, all right.
You win, Knoblach.

01:07:36.194 --> 01:07:38.527
It's all yours.

01:07:45.061 --> 01:07:47.295
- There you go.
- Thank you.

01:07:49.427 --> 01:07:51.625
This is not a victory for me.

01:07:51.627 --> 01:07:54.926
This is a victory
for all of Calico Ridge.

01:07:54.928 --> 01:07:57.392
- Fuck you.
- That's right.

01:07:57.394 --> 01:08:01.092
Action Point and everything
in it is now officially yours.

01:08:01.094 --> 01:08:03.626
Yeah, I know. That's great.
Thanks for the information.

01:08:03.628 --> 01:08:05.859
And contractually I just want
to point out

01:08:05.861 --> 01:08:08.560
that I'm no longer liable
for any lawsuits or injuries

01:08:08.562 --> 01:08:10.893
or anything else regarding this park.
Isn't that right, Rodney?

01:08:10.895 --> 01:08:14.626
Right, those have all been legally
transferred over to the new owner.

01:08:14.628 --> 01:08:18.158
- And that's you, Knoblick.
- Yeah, well, who gives a shit?

01:08:18.161 --> 01:08:20.560
7 Parks is gonna level
this dump anyway.

01:08:20.563 --> 01:08:24.095
Just shut up.

01:08:26.328 --> 01:08:29.059
- Hey, thanks, baby.
- You're welcome.

01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:31.961
All right, everybody,
are you ready?

01:08:31.962 --> 01:08:35.728
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
- Action Point is now open.

01:08:35.729 --> 01:08:38.928
- Free beer for everybody!
- D.C., no!

01:08:41.063 --> 01:08:43.127
Hold on a second. No.

01:08:50.429 --> 01:08:55.627
- -Have a ball!
Have a ball! Free beer on Knoblach!

01:08:57.796 --> 01:09:00.064
Oh, God!

01:09:01.229 --> 01:09:02.331
Oh, shit!

01:09:12.497 --> 01:09:16.564
You guys are losers.
You'll always be fucking losers.

01:09:24.798 --> 01:09:28.564
Jesus. Ah, that is disgusting.

01:09:28.566 --> 01:09:30.599
Oh, shit.

01:10:17.299 --> 01:10:19.900
Put that down!

01:10:22.266 --> 01:10:24.066
- Whoo-wee!
- Hey!

01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:26.398
Is there a lawyer
in the house?

01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:29.499
- You work for me!
- Our business is concluded!

01:10:29.501 --> 01:10:32.298
I'm taking on new clients.

01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:33.800
You...

01:10:34.899 --> 01:10:37.065
Anyone need a good lawyer?

01:10:37.067 --> 01:10:38.932
- Ron.
- What?

01:10:38.934 --> 01:10:40.765
You take your balls out of your
purse and stop these people.

01:10:40.767 --> 01:10:43.166
- What do you want me to do?
- Hey.

01:10:43.168 --> 01:10:45.402
You son of a bitch.

01:10:51.769 --> 01:10:53.366
Yes!

01:11:23.937 --> 01:11:26.735
<i>Later that night,
me and the Shitbirds, well,</i>

01:11:26.737 --> 01:11:29.467
<i>we said goodbye to the park
in our own way.</i>

01:11:29.469 --> 01:11:31.801
How the fuck
do you wanna do this?

01:11:31.803 --> 01:11:35.304
Who gives a shit? Just light
'em up and see what happens.

01:12:42.073 --> 01:12:43.170
Boogie?

01:12:43.172 --> 01:12:44.806
Boogie?

01:12:45.873 --> 01:12:47.706
Boogie!

01:12:48.340 --> 01:12:50.574
What? I'm right here.

01:12:52.307 --> 01:12:53.671
I thought you had taken off.

01:12:53.673 --> 01:12:55.637
I'm just putting my suitcase
in the car.

01:12:55.639 --> 01:12:58.640
Gotta be at the bus station
in an hour, you know.

01:13:06.073 --> 01:13:07.606
No, we don't.

01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:10.674
What do you mean?

01:13:11.041 --> 01:13:14.138
Well, how about we take
a road trip, me and you,

01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:16.474
all the way to New York City?

01:13:17.340 --> 01:13:18.872
Yeah?

01:13:18.874 --> 01:13:24.841
And then... maybe I stick around
and see what happens?

01:13:27.607 --> 01:13:29.706
I mean, you are going
into high school now

01:13:29.708 --> 01:13:33.575
and I'm gonna have to chaperone
any and all dates.

01:13:35.841 --> 01:13:38.741
I also thought we would stop
in Austin along the way.

01:13:40.208 --> 01:13:41.873
What's in Austin?

01:13:41.875 --> 01:13:45.239
Well, a little band
called The Clash.

01:13:45.241 --> 01:13:47.374
Maybe you heard of 'em?

01:13:49.409 --> 01:13:52.108
- Did somebody say road trip?
- Oh, God.

01:13:52.110 --> 01:13:54.706
What? Oh. Oh.

01:13:54.708 --> 01:13:58.343
- Right after my morning swim.
- Dear God, Benny.

01:13:58.708 --> 01:14:01.308
- Come on, Siouxie.
- Guess we got company.

01:14:06.076 --> 01:14:08.109
I like that story, Papaw.

01:14:11.477 --> 01:14:13.341
You know,
I give your mom a hard time.

01:14:13.343 --> 01:14:16.541
But parenting ain't easy.
She's just looking out for you.

01:14:16.543 --> 01:14:18.308
I guess.

01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:21.509
Besides, she's the best thing
to ever happen to me.

01:14:21.511 --> 01:14:23.610
Before you came along.

01:14:25.810 --> 01:14:29.610
Wow. When I was younger, I could
do four of these at a time.

01:14:36.977 --> 01:14:39.075
- Dad?
- Hi, Mom.

01:14:39.077 --> 01:14:41.009
You OK? You all right?

01:14:41.011 --> 01:14:43.777
- Rudie, are you OK?
- Don't worry about me.

01:14:44.977 --> 01:14:46.742
You all right, Dad?

01:14:46.744 --> 01:14:49.175
Yeah, just came outside
to get a little fresh air.

01:14:49.177 --> 01:14:51.242
All right.

01:14:51.244 --> 01:14:53.843
Oh, man.

01:14:53.845 --> 01:14:56.175
Are you gonna get sick?
You want a beer?

01:14:56.177 --> 01:15:00.511
Ah, it's OK.
Oh, I think I got a hemorrhoid.

01:15:01.911 --> 01:15:04.575
All right, Papaw's gotta go.

01:15:04.577 --> 01:15:06.776
He's got a lamb stew
on slow boil.

01:15:06.778 --> 01:15:10.144
Thanks, Dad.
She loves having you around.

01:15:10.146 --> 01:15:12.309
We both do.

01:15:12.311 --> 01:15:14.411
- Bye, kid.
- Bye, Papaw.

01:15:14.413 --> 01:15:17.477
Maybe next week
we'll go get us some tattoos.

01:15:19.645 --> 01:15:22.642
Mom, I think I'm gonna go
lie down in my room.

01:15:22.644 --> 01:15:24.944
Kind of tired.

01:15:24.946 --> 01:15:28.745
- Papaw has a lot of energy.
- He does.

01:16:04.348 --> 01:16:07.548
Ha, ha, ha. Dad, get up.

01:16:11.847 --> 01:16:15.513
Bet you thought
the old man had bit it.

01:16:19.482 --> 01:16:21.716
Ha-ha!

01:16:31.048 --> 01:16:33.747
She always would buy dirty
magazines, and I was, like,

01:16:33.749 --> 01:16:36.947
"Mom, why is Grandma
always looking at naked ladies?"

01:16:36.949 --> 01:16:40.549
She was, like, "Oh, Chris..."
Fuck, I used my fucking name.

01:16:46.082 --> 01:16:48.115
Yes!

01:16:51.916 --> 01:16:54.616
Somebody hand me a beer
and listen up.

01:16:56.450 --> 01:16:58.650
That's a hit.

01:17:02.750 --> 01:17:05.382
And he's dead.
You're all sad. Action!

01:17:16.083 --> 01:17:17.616
- Shit!
- Jesus.

01:17:26.517 --> 01:17:30.917
There's, like, zebras everywhere
and there's, like, flocks of...

01:17:32.351 --> 01:17:34.884
All right, hold on.
I'm getting a call.

01:17:37.385 --> 01:17:39.085
Hello?

01:17:43.617 --> 01:17:46.615
Three, two, one. Action!

01:17:46.617 --> 01:17:49.119
Whoa! Whoa!

01:17:49.651 --> 01:17:53.117
Can you put a nut
on my lens here?

01:17:56.319 --> 01:17:57.919
He got bit.

01:18:05.586 --> 01:18:08.950
I need... I need more
of that fucking stuff.

01:18:08.952 --> 01:18:11.085
It... It came out of my eyes.

01:18:49.822 --> 01:18:54.822
