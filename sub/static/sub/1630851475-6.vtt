WEBVTT

00:08.091 --> 00:11.636
Kai, you haven't moved
from that chair in an hour!

00:11.720 --> 00:13.847
You were supposed to set
the table tonight.

00:13.930 --> 00:16.433
Sorry. You know I hate doing stuff.

00:17.475 --> 00:20.270
That was Principal Peterson
from Liliuokalani High.

00:20.353 --> 00:21.938
She invited me back as an esteemed alumni

00:22.022 --> 00:23.106
to host a Career Day booth.

00:23.815 --> 00:25.984
Wow, Lahela, that's impressive!

00:26.067 --> 00:27.902
Going back to high school
sounds miserable.

00:27.986 --> 00:30.196
Remember how bad it was when I was nine?

00:30.280 --> 00:32.198
Nobody wanted to be friends with me.

00:32.282 --> 00:35.285
Everyone looked at me
like I was some weird little mascot.

00:35.910 --> 00:37.620
And for that one football game, I was.

00:37.704 --> 00:41.916
Oh, you looked so cute
in that fighting jellyfish costume.

00:43.668 --> 00:45.503
Kai, you know,

00:45.587 --> 00:48.506
Career Day sounds like a fun opportunity

00:48.590 --> 00:50.341
for you to start thinking
about your future,

00:50.425 --> 00:53.219
especially with the SAT
just around the corner.

00:53.803 --> 00:57.640
It'll probably be all the useless jobs
like teachers and doctors.

00:58.641 --> 01:00.310
-No offense.

01:00.393 --> 01:04.272
But I want a chill job
that gives me freedom and fresh air.

01:04.355 --> 01:08.026
Like, I don't know,
a mobile shave ice and flower business?

01:08.610 --> 01:10.236
No, something actually cool.

01:11.696 --> 01:14.532
Oh, what do you think
a hot-air balloon operator gets paid?

01:16.951 --> 01:18.161
Not a lot.

01:20.955 --> 01:23.833
The party's at eight,
so people know it's not a dinner thing.

01:23.917 --> 01:26.503
But I'll have finger foods, obvs.
And dips.

01:26.586 --> 01:28.004
-Gotta have dips.
-Hmm.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.131
Oh, work party? I'll bring Codenames!

01:30.215 --> 01:33.551
Oh, Lahela girl, it's not really
a board game kind of party.

01:33.635 --> 01:36.346
-Dr. Lee hired a bartender.
-Uh, a mixologist.

01:36.429 --> 01:39.099
Which means you can't legally come. Sorry.

01:39.182 --> 01:42.560
Right, right.
The party's not teen-appropriate.

01:42.852 --> 01:45.438
Like last time.
And the time before that...

01:45.522 --> 01:46.940
Sorry, Doog. You know how it is.

01:47.023 --> 01:49.567
You wouldn't want adults
at one of your high school parties, right?

01:50.151 --> 01:53.696
Well, I'm not in high school,
so I don't get invited to those either.

01:54.364 --> 01:55.698
I'm a teenager and a doctor,

01:55.782 --> 01:58.243
but I can't hang out
with teenagers or doctors.

01:58.326 --> 02:01.246
It's kind of the story of my life,
I don't fit in anywhere.

02:02.539 --> 02:04.124
DR.Wow, that really sucks for you.

02:04.207 --> 02:07.210
If this helps, I also didn't have
a lot of friends growing up.

02:08.211 --> 02:10.713
But later in life, no one can tell.

02:10.797 --> 02:12.215
-Yeah, no one, no.
-Yeah.

02:12.298 --> 02:13.842
-No one can tell. Yeah. Sure.
-No one.

02:13.925 --> 02:15.176
No one.

02:48.501 --> 02:50.044
All right, you caught me.

02:50.128 --> 02:52.213
I was just flashing
that security guard down there.

02:52.297 --> 02:54.841
Those are tinted windows.

02:54.924 --> 02:57.093
That explains the indifference.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.052
I was almost offended.

02:58.136 --> 02:59.721
So what do you got for me?

02:59.804 --> 03:01.556
Let me guess, more bad news?

03:01.639 --> 03:05.310
"I'm Doogie,
you have chronic renal failure!

03:05.393 --> 03:07.061
Your kidney is shutting down!"

03:07.145 --> 03:09.189
That is not what I sound like!

03:10.231 --> 03:12.066
So, did you find me a new kidney?

03:13.651 --> 03:16.487
Well, you are on the transplant list...

03:17.280 --> 03:21.159
Because your HLA type is rare,
finding a match is very difficult.

03:21.242 --> 03:24.162
Our best bet is still a relative.

03:24.245 --> 03:26.497
Have you reached out to your sister yet?

03:28.291 --> 03:29.667
I told you.

03:29.918 --> 03:32.879
Hell will freeze over
before I ask her for a favor.

03:34.339 --> 03:39.344
Frankie, I don't wanna scare you,
but finding a kidney donor takes time.

03:40.553 --> 03:42.096
Time you may not have.

03:43.723 --> 03:45.058
So...

03:45.808 --> 03:47.143
Maybe I could call her?

03:47.977 --> 03:50.980
By all means, reach out.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.607
If you feel like getting criticized.

03:52.690 --> 03:54.275
I can handle it.

03:54.359 --> 03:56.194
I was raised by a woman from Philly,

03:56.277 --> 03:58.738
who was also raised
by a woman from Philly.

03:58.821 --> 04:01.824
My grandma called me a wimp
because I've never been in a bar fight.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.034
I'm 16.

04:03.117 --> 04:05.370
Oh, well, that's no excuse.

04:05.954 --> 04:07.330
That's what she said.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.923
Lahela, you have
the most popular booth here!

04:17.006 --> 04:18.299
I can't believe you were nervous.

04:18.383 --> 04:21.135
I know! All the students here
are actually super friendly.

04:21.219 --> 04:23.471
Way nicer than my doctor friends
that always ditch me.

04:23.554 --> 04:25.848
And I thought coming back to high school
was gonna be scary.

04:25.932 --> 04:27.350
You need to watch less <i>Riverdale.</i>

04:29.018 --> 04:34.357
Okay, I think I've narrowed it down...
to magician or dolphin masseuse.

04:36.150 --> 04:38.528
Ugh. Here come the worst of the worst.

04:39.153 --> 04:41.239
The Liliuokalani dance team.

04:58.256 --> 04:59.924
Why don’t you like The Royals?

05:00.008 --> 05:01.217
Yeah, you love to dance.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.636
I'm always workin' it
at our TikTok nights! You should join!

05:03.720 --> 05:05.847
Me? Never gonna happen.

05:06.931 --> 05:08.266
I'm not even interested.

05:09.142 --> 05:12.562
Those snotty dum-dums
strut around like they own the place.

05:15.857 --> 05:18.192
<i>I mean, who would want
to be in a big group of friends</i>

05:18.276 --> 05:20.403
<i>with matching scrunchies and jackets</i>

05:20.486 --> 05:22.947
<i>and are always laughing,
and getting invited to parties,</i>

05:23.031 --> 05:25.491
and... calling each other "babe"?

05:26.868 --> 05:27.952
Yeah, who wants that?

05:28.661 --> 05:30.330
You know I've homeroom
with a couple of 'em.

05:30.413 --> 05:31.748
They're actually really nice.

05:31.831 --> 05:35.376
Oh, so popular athletes are nice
to other popular athletes?

05:35.460 --> 05:36.419
Imagine that.

05:37.837 --> 05:39.213
Hey, guys!

05:39.297 --> 05:41.716
OMG, you're Lahela, right? I'm Olivia!

05:41.799 --> 05:44.552
I actually came over to ask a tiny favor.

05:44.635 --> 05:47.013
I know you're a busy doctor,
so no presh, obvs.

05:48.348 --> 05:51.225
So, the dance team
has been pulling two-a-days,

05:51.309 --> 05:53.227
because we're rehearsing
for the Channel Six news'

05:53.311 --> 05:55.688
"Local Stars" segment with Rip Tide.

05:55.772 --> 05:57.357
I love that guy. That's awesome!

05:57.440 --> 05:58.608
Thanks!

05:58.691 --> 06:01.361
I was wondering
if you could stop by practice

06:01.444 --> 06:03.112
to give the team some recovery pointers?

06:03.780 --> 06:05.740
Yeah, I could... totally come.

06:06.908 --> 06:09.702
To make sure you guys are dancing
and having fun

06:09.786 --> 06:12.246
and laughing and being friends... safely.

06:12.330 --> 06:13.164
For medical reasons.

06:14.791 --> 06:16.751
You are amazing.

06:16.834 --> 06:18.252
Thanks, babe!

06:19.629 --> 06:20.755
She's so needy.

06:21.672 --> 06:23.299
Can you make sure my team is safe?

06:23.883 --> 06:27.178
Come on, Steph,
I think Walter's right. She seems nice.

06:27.929 --> 06:29.514
Not that it matters.

06:29.806 --> 06:33.101
I'm just going to practice strictly
in a professional capacity.

06:33.684 --> 06:36.771
Whatevs, I'm gonna go hit up
the counter-intelligence booth,

06:36.854 --> 06:37.939
and act shady.

06:38.398 --> 06:39.273
See what they do.

06:47.490 --> 06:48.324
Hey, guys!

06:48.408 --> 06:49.450
-Hey!
-Hey!

06:49.534 --> 06:51.786
Man, today was awesome!

06:51.869 --> 06:52.912
Awesome?

06:52.995 --> 06:54.705
Did you skip Career Day?

06:54.789 --> 06:57.291
What? No, of course not.
They had free pizza.

06:57.375 --> 07:01.796
Mom, Dad, I found my calling!
I'm gonna be a farmer.

07:02.380 --> 07:03.214
A farmer?

07:03.840 --> 07:08.344
Well, a volunteer organic farmer,
but who needs money?

07:09.095 --> 07:10.805
That's great, Kai.

07:10.888 --> 07:12.348
Hawaii needs more farms.

07:12.432 --> 07:13.599
Sounds like a fun hobby.

07:15.685 --> 07:18.604
Oh, guys, this isn't just my hobby, no.

07:18.688 --> 07:20.064
This is gonna be my career.

07:20.148 --> 07:21.274
Moonstar, Trevor, and Sedona,

07:21.357 --> 07:23.734
who ran the farming booth,
do it full-time.

07:24.402 --> 07:27.071
I'm gonna go and shadow them tomorrow
at the farm.

07:27.155 --> 07:30.283
We're just gonna chill
and become one with the land.

07:30.366 --> 07:31.617
Maybe even have a mud bath?

07:31.701 --> 07:32.743
-Huh.

07:32.827 --> 07:35.204
Kai, shouldn't you be
gearing up for the SAT?

07:35.788 --> 07:38.916
It's in a few days and I want to
make sure that you're really...

07:39.000 --> 07:40.168
I think it's a great idea!

07:41.502 --> 07:43.171
Go on and have fun.

07:44.714 --> 07:46.507
-Thanks, Dad!
-Uh.

07:46.591 --> 07:49.135
Oh, and FYI, I'll probably be home late,

07:49.218 --> 07:51.596
just depends on how long
the massage train goes.

07:53.806 --> 07:54.849
Benny!

07:54.932 --> 07:57.059
That's exactly what I worried about!

07:57.143 --> 08:00.688
He… He wants to mud bath
and chill as a career!

08:00.771 --> 08:03.691
Hey, I'm on your side,
but let's be tactical.

08:03.774 --> 08:05.485
The kid's not famous for his work ethic.

08:05.568 --> 08:06.402
No.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.946
One day of manual labor
and this will all blow over.

08:09.030 --> 08:10.114
Trust me.

08:12.116 --> 08:13.951
Benny Kamealoha.

08:14.702 --> 08:16.454
That's very wise of you.

08:17.413 --> 08:19.457
I'm more than a pretty face
and watermelon quads.

08:19.540 --> 08:22.752
Guys. All this talk
about Career Day got me thinking

08:22.835 --> 08:24.253
about what I wanna do with my life.

08:24.337 --> 08:27.423
And... I think I figured it out.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.175
I'm gonna be a supermodel.

08:29.884 --> 08:30.927
A supermodel?

08:31.594 --> 08:32.553
Yeah, you know.

08:32.637 --> 08:36.724
The career path that Cindy, Naomi, Kate,
and the girls blazed back in the '90s?

08:36.807 --> 08:38.184
Do a controversial Calvin ad,

08:38.267 --> 08:40.686
start hanging out
with Pete Davidson, the works.

08:41.562 --> 08:42.897
Sure, sweetie.

08:42.980 --> 08:45.650
The key is finding your light.

08:50.238 --> 08:53.157
-That's your light.
-Yeah, you found it.

08:53.241 --> 08:56.077
Remember,
a lack of flexibility in your wrists

08:56.160 --> 08:57.703
can increase your potential for injury.

08:57.787 --> 09:00.456
You gotta keep those forearm flexors
and lats from getting too tight.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.792
I'd hit them both
with foam rollers after practice.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.210
Got it. Thanks, babe!

09:04.293 --> 09:06.420
-We'll go in five, babes!
-Sure, babe.

09:06.504 --> 09:07.922
So what do you think of the routine?

09:08.506 --> 09:10.758
Oh, it looked ergonomically sound.

09:10.841 --> 09:13.886
No, not like that.
I mean, your non-medical opinion.

09:14.595 --> 09:17.473
You mean as like as a teenager-teenager,
not a doctor-teenager?

09:17.557 --> 09:18.391
Mm-hmm.

09:19.058 --> 09:20.017
I loved it!

09:20.101 --> 09:22.687
That pop and lock? So dope, so Gucci!

09:23.271 --> 09:25.439
But, as a doctor-teenager,
I do have to say,

09:25.523 --> 09:28.901
that high kick at the end
could lead to anterior ankle impingement.

09:29.694 --> 09:31.696
That's a bummer, it was our big finish.

09:32.321 --> 09:34.115
Well, what if
you tried something like this?

09:38.035 --> 09:40.580
It's a lot easier on the fibula so...

09:41.622 --> 09:44.584
That was actually... amazing!

09:44.667 --> 09:46.210
You're a natural.

09:46.294 --> 09:49.213
I love your vibe and you got moves!

09:49.672 --> 09:51.882
Would you wanna dance
with us for Channel Six?

09:52.592 --> 09:55.219
Uh, yeah, I would love to!

09:55.303 --> 09:57.013
Great, then it's official.

09:57.888 --> 10:00.182
Welcome to The Royals, babe.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.147
-Hmm.

10:06.230 --> 10:07.523
What up, son!

10:08.274 --> 10:11.277
On a scale of one to <i>Emily in Paris,</i>
how bad was practice?

10:11.360 --> 10:13.529
It was actually fun.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.531
Like real Paris, without Emily.

10:15.615 --> 10:16.574
Hold up.

10:17.617 --> 10:18.993
Why are you wearing that?

10:19.577 --> 10:20.703
Oh, this?

10:20.786 --> 10:22.246
They kinda asked me to join the team.

10:22.913 --> 10:24.332
I think you may have misjudged them.

10:24.415 --> 10:27.460
Olivia is actually really nice...
and smart.

10:28.169 --> 10:30.546
So, you're just gonna, like,
hang with them and what?

10:31.213 --> 10:33.799
Go to Zippy's after an awesome party
and share a plate of pancakes?

10:34.634 --> 10:36.552
Steph, for the first time,

10:36.636 --> 10:39.305
I'm the right age
for the environment I'm in.

10:39.388 --> 10:41.724
I fit in and it feels incredible!

10:43.934 --> 10:44.894
Wait...

10:45.770 --> 10:46.854
Are you jelly?

10:48.898 --> 10:52.652
Steph Denisco is eating
straight up jelly sandwiches!

10:52.735 --> 10:53.861
I'm not jealous!

10:53.944 --> 10:57.448
I don't care, just as long
as we're still on for our TikTok night.

10:57.531 --> 10:59.408
Uh, obviously.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.118
We can't deny the world these moves!

11:01.202 --> 11:02.912
Okay, good,
'cause I've got a new one for us.

11:02.995 --> 11:04.580
I call it the twist 'n' roll.

11:05.915 --> 11:06.999
Pa!

11:07.667 --> 11:09.794
It's based on my go-to order
at Wetzel's Pretzels.

11:09.877 --> 11:11.087
Hey, I know your mom got fired,

11:11.170 --> 11:12.880
but do you think
we can still get free pretzels?

11:12.963 --> 11:14.965
Totally. She's still dating the manager.

12:08.144 --> 12:09.603
Dr. Choi pulled some strings

12:09.687 --> 12:12.440
and got us Don Ho's beach house
for the party!

12:12.523 --> 12:15.443
Dope mansion
plus flair mixologist equals lit!

12:15.526 --> 12:16.485
Who's Don Ho?

12:16.569 --> 12:17.695
Oh, girl.

12:17.778 --> 12:21.240
You know you're too young to party
with us when you don't know who Don Ho is!

12:21.323 --> 12:23.409
I know, right? I love Dan Ho.

12:23.492 --> 12:25.870
He's such a great... painter?

12:27.997 --> 12:30.040
I don't even care
that you guys always leave me out.

12:30.124 --> 12:31.876
I got friends my own age now.

12:31.959 --> 12:33.377
I am on The Royals.

12:35.296 --> 12:37.548
You know you're too old to party with me

12:37.631 --> 12:39.300
when you don't know who The Royals are.

12:40.134 --> 12:41.051
Later, babes.

12:41.135 --> 12:44.430
-Wait, is it a band? Am I old?

12:44.513 --> 12:46.098
Good. She doesn't care about the party.

12:46.182 --> 12:47.516
She's got her own thing!

12:47.600 --> 12:50.436
Great, more time for the three amigos!

12:50.519 --> 12:52.772
I'm gonna be rocking
a pretty deep V at the party,

12:52.855 --> 12:55.065
so I'm gonna need you guys
to be on nipple watch.

12:55.691 --> 12:56.692
Okay.

13:00.321 --> 13:03.073
Hey, Doog, did someone
come in here last night

13:03.157 --> 13:04.575
and put deodorant on me?

13:04.658 --> 13:08.078
Because I'm wearing some,
but I don't remember putting any on.

13:08.162 --> 13:09.914
I... doubt it.

13:09.997 --> 13:11.874
That's not really what we do here.

13:12.583 --> 13:14.335
But I have some good news!

13:14.418 --> 13:18.714
I spoke with your sister, Patty,
on the phone and... she's here!

13:21.926 --> 13:22.885
Patty.

13:23.677 --> 13:25.596
After all these years...

13:25.679 --> 13:29.058
I see you're still going
to that dollar store hairdresser.

13:29.141 --> 13:30.392
Well, you should call her.

13:30.476 --> 13:33.062
She'd do wonders
with the hair coming out of your nose.

13:33.145 --> 13:35.022
Patty! Thank you
for coming in for testing.

13:35.105 --> 13:38.400
I have reviewed the results
and I have great news.

13:38.776 --> 13:40.528
You're a perfect match!

13:44.198 --> 13:47.493
Well, it's only great news
if I'm feeling generous.

13:47.576 --> 13:50.079
You're Frankie's last option.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.164
This is life or death.

13:52.248 --> 13:54.291
You were always lazy.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.377
No surprise your kidney followed suit.

13:56.460 --> 13:58.462
I hope it was worth it, Patty.

13:59.171 --> 14:02.842
All that time you spent working
when I quit my job to take care of Mom.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.927
Oh, please.

14:05.010 --> 14:07.847
I was there for Mom and you weren't.

14:09.932 --> 14:11.225
No, Patty, wait!

14:11.809 --> 14:12.643
As a doctor,

14:12.726 --> 14:16.981
I see siblings meet each other
the first day of their lives,

14:17.731 --> 14:20.943
and... sit next to each other on the last.

14:22.528 --> 14:27.408
I know you two have a lot of issues,
but... if you walk out that door,

14:28.033 --> 14:30.327
you're never gonna get the chance
to resolve them.

14:37.710 --> 14:38.544
I'll do it.

14:40.504 --> 14:42.673
But I have one condition.

14:42.756 --> 14:47.219
After the transplant,
never speak to me again.

14:54.310 --> 14:56.145
Hey, sweetie, how was the farm?

14:56.228 --> 14:58.188
Unreal! Life-changing!

14:58.814 --> 15:00.900
Did you know that pineapples
aren't even apples?

15:00.983 --> 15:02.985
I can't wait to go back tomorrow.

15:03.068 --> 15:05.905
I learned that milk
doesn't only come from cows.

15:06.405 --> 15:08.157
Goats. And even almonds.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.075
Like, where are the udders
on those little guys?

15:10.159 --> 15:14.914
Kai, you can't go back tomorrow,
you're taking the SAT, remember?

15:14.997 --> 15:16.957
College isn't in the cards for me anymore.

15:17.041 --> 15:18.918
I'm actually gonna shred up my SAT book,

15:19.001 --> 15:20.210
it'll make perfect bedding
for the chickens.

15:20.294 --> 15:21.503
You're going to college, dude.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.380
-Yeah.
-Education is important.

15:23.464 --> 15:27.259
I know the shave ice truck seems chill,
but I need my business degree to run it.

15:27.343 --> 15:28.636
-Yeah.
-Hey.

15:28.719 --> 15:32.181
I may not be taking the traditional path
that you want for me,

15:32.765 --> 15:34.141
but this is what I want.

15:34.224 --> 15:36.143
Everything I need to know,
I'll learn at the farm!

15:36.226 --> 15:39.229
Actually, you'll learn it in college.

15:39.563 --> 15:42.858
You're taking the SAT tomorrow
and that's final.

15:42.942 --> 15:43.943
I'm almost an adult.

15:44.026 --> 15:46.111
You can't tell me what to do with my life.

15:50.741 --> 15:53.994
Guys, I need a name that matches the face.

15:54.578 --> 15:58.916
I think I'm going to rebrand
to Brione Patrique.

16:04.713 --> 16:06.632
Look what I found
in my neighbor's garbage!

16:07.341 --> 16:10.844
It's either a huge ring light
or an old toilet seat.

16:10.928 --> 16:11.929
Steph, hey!

16:12.012 --> 16:13.555
Hi, babe!

16:13.722 --> 16:14.640
Hey!

16:15.474 --> 16:16.767
What's Olivia doing here?

16:17.643 --> 16:19.228
We were rehearsing for the big show,

16:19.311 --> 16:21.397
and I thought she could stay
for our TikTok night.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.315
We can all hang out together.
It'll be fun.

16:23.899 --> 16:27.277
Oh, okay, I just thought
this was our thing.

16:27.361 --> 16:28.278
But that's cool...

16:28.362 --> 16:30.990
Hey! Steph, right? I'm Olivia.

16:31.073 --> 16:32.700
I think we have AP Biochem together.

16:32.783 --> 16:34.576
Oh, no, I'm not in science.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.912
I'm taking six art classes
and four study halls.

16:37.663 --> 16:39.957
Right! Well, I've def seen you around!

16:40.541 --> 16:42.334
Weird, I don't think I've seen you.

16:42.418 --> 16:44.420
It's not like you make
an entrance everywhere you go,

16:44.503 --> 16:46.839
or that I've watched
all your ponytail tutorials or anything.

16:47.840 --> 16:48.924
Oh.

16:49.591 --> 16:50.718
Maybe we should get started.

16:50.801 --> 16:52.594
Steph, should we try out your new move?

16:52.678 --> 16:53.971
Oh, the twist 'n' roll?

16:55.639 --> 16:56.849
Okay.

17:04.273 --> 17:06.025
As much as I love that,

17:06.108 --> 17:08.527
I was thinking a half turn
with a shoulder pop

17:08.610 --> 17:10.654
may hit the beat a little cleaner?
Like this!

17:12.114 --> 17:14.658
Let's do that.
It works perfectly with the beat, babe.

17:17.995 --> 17:20.873
You know what,
Olivia's move does work perfectly.

17:22.124 --> 17:23.042
I'm out.

17:23.834 --> 17:25.335
Steph, wait...

17:30.674 --> 17:33.052
Okay, I can't get this to slam.
So, I'm just gonna say "slam."

17:33.552 --> 17:34.845
-Slam!

17:37.639 --> 17:38.891
Wait, Steph.

17:38.974 --> 17:40.267
What was that up there?

17:41.769 --> 17:45.314
Well, now that you have a new best friend,
you clearly don't need me anymore. So...

17:46.148 --> 17:47.483
Wait. What?

17:47.900 --> 17:50.194
You are my best friend.
Of course, I need you!

17:50.277 --> 17:52.237
No, you don't. You got the dance team now.

17:52.780 --> 17:54.490
Everything's perfect for you per usual.

17:54.573 --> 17:56.533
Wait, my life is far from perfect.

17:56.617 --> 18:00.120
I'm finally fitting in somewhere
and you can't even be happy for me!

18:00.204 --> 18:02.498
You want me to feel sorry for you
because you're a doctor?

18:02.998 --> 18:05.542
Who gets to dance on TV? With Rip Tide?

18:05.626 --> 18:07.628
I'm not dancing with Rip Tide!

18:07.711 --> 18:09.963
Why do you even care about fitting
into high school anyway?

18:10.047 --> 18:12.257
You're not even
in high school anymore. I am.

18:12.341 --> 18:14.426
Well, you're acting
like you're in pre-school.

18:14.510 --> 18:16.553
A real friend would be happy for me!

18:18.597 --> 18:20.224
Well, then I guess we're not real friends.

18:21.308 --> 18:22.559
You know what? I'm done.

18:22.643 --> 18:24.478
Now, the only thing climbing
in your window

18:24.561 --> 18:26.480
will be burglars or very smart lizards!

18:26.563 --> 18:28.941
Good. You climbing in my window
was lame anyway.

18:43.622 --> 18:44.706
Hey, Frankie.

18:44.790 --> 18:46.375
Your vitals look good.

18:46.458 --> 18:48.585
The transplant went perfectly.

18:48.961 --> 18:49.795
How are you feeling?

18:49.878 --> 18:51.004
How's Patty?

18:51.630 --> 18:52.631
She's doing well.

18:53.006 --> 18:55.217
She should be coming out
of anesthesia soon.

18:56.593 --> 18:57.553
You know what, doc.

18:57.636 --> 18:59.930
I don't know
if I'm getting soft in my old age,

19:00.013 --> 19:02.641
or it's this sweet cocktail of meds
you got me on,

19:02.724 --> 19:04.768
but... I miss Patty.

19:05.561 --> 19:07.604
We used to be inseparable.

19:07.688 --> 19:08.981
She was my best friend.

19:10.899 --> 19:12.818
What even happened between you two?

19:12.901 --> 19:14.903
Everything always worked out for Patty.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.782
Career, family,
even her kidneys were better.

19:19.658 --> 19:23.412
I never should have said that to her
about not saying goodbye to Mom.

19:24.329 --> 19:25.664
We all grieve differently,

19:25.747 --> 19:29.042
and I know that she was just hurting
too much to be there.

19:29.668 --> 19:31.044
Well, I was no saint either.

19:42.931 --> 19:47.853
Um, I was having a private conversation
with my underage doctor.

19:49.605 --> 19:52.649
Frankie, I may be speaking
out of turn here,

19:52.733 --> 19:55.152
but I didn't push for that operation

19:55.235 --> 19:57.279
so that you could continue
to hold a grudge.

19:58.363 --> 20:01.909
I did it so that you could live
a long and happy life.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.329
And that means letting go of the past...

20:06.330 --> 20:07.539
and forgiving.

20:08.373 --> 20:10.417
You two clearly love each other.

20:10.959 --> 20:12.711
I mean, she gave you her kidney.

20:16.632 --> 20:18.217
You shouldn't waste any more time.

20:19.885 --> 20:20.969
She's right.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.512
Frankie...

20:24.014 --> 20:28.018
you took amazing care of Mom,
and I never thanked you for that.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.812
I'm sorry that I wasn't there.

20:31.939 --> 20:35.150
And I'm sorry
that I was so hard on you all these years.

20:37.653 --> 20:39.988
It would be nice
to have my best friend back.

20:42.908 --> 20:46.245
I'll leave you two,
I bet you have a lot of catching up to do.

20:47.120 --> 20:50.874
I can't believe
Kai actually blew off the SAT.

20:50.958 --> 20:55.045
He disobeyed us, just so he could go
to some hippie-dippy farm!

20:55.128 --> 20:58.215
I believe it. It hurts, but I believe it.

20:58.298 --> 21:00.008
Oh, great.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.593
There's no service.

21:01.677 --> 21:04.471
I can't even send him a stern text.

21:11.979 --> 21:14.606
It's... beautiful.

21:16.817 --> 21:17.818
There's Kai!

21:19.152 --> 21:20.320
Sweet, dude.

21:20.404 --> 21:24.032
Oh, my god. Is he... working?

21:24.116 --> 21:25.117
He is!

21:26.368 --> 21:27.828
And he looks happy.

21:28.954 --> 21:30.414
Happily working.

21:31.832 --> 21:33.208
I never thought I'd see this.

21:38.755 --> 21:41.758
Lahela, congrats on the transplant.

21:41.842 --> 21:43.719
Those kidney sisters were rough.

21:43.802 --> 21:46.972
Listen, we feel bad for leaving you out
just 'cause you're younger than us.

21:47.055 --> 21:48.348
Yeah, Lahela.

21:48.432 --> 21:50.934
We love you, and we want you
to come to the party.

21:51.018 --> 21:52.811
It wouldn't be as fun without you.

21:53.520 --> 21:55.147
Really?

21:55.605 --> 21:56.690
What about the bartender?

21:56.773 --> 21:58.150
Mixologist.

21:58.233 --> 22:00.444
And these two made me cancel him.

22:01.153 --> 22:02.946
It's too late to get back
the security deposit,

22:03.030 --> 22:05.198
so I'll now be charging a cover
at the door.

22:05.782 --> 22:08.118
So what time should I pick you up?

22:08.785 --> 22:12.873
Oh, guys, thank you.
I mean, this means so much to me.

22:12.956 --> 22:16.376
I've wanted to be invited
to one of your parties for... forever.

22:16.835 --> 22:18.712
But I can't make it.

22:18.795 --> 22:20.213
Wait, seriously?

22:20.297 --> 22:21.423
Sorry.

22:21.506 --> 22:23.216
There's something important I have to do.

22:27.137 --> 22:30.015
Whatever, more dip for us.

22:32.642 --> 22:34.978
Whatever, more dip for me.

22:38.523 --> 22:41.443
Okay. Before you say anything, I'm sorry.

22:41.526 --> 22:44.529
I know it was wrong for me
to skip the SAT, but...

22:45.489 --> 22:47.449
I've found what I want to do with my life!

22:47.532 --> 22:50.118
Kai, you shouldn't have disobeyed us.

22:50.202 --> 22:52.788
Yeah, your father is absolutely right.

22:53.538 --> 22:56.041
But I will say, this place is...

22:56.124 --> 22:58.210
Incredible? Inspiring? I know.

22:59.586 --> 23:01.546
-Welcome to the farm.

23:02.798 --> 23:03.799
That looks so good.

23:03.882 --> 23:06.426
It's non-GMO South Pacific spinach.

23:06.510 --> 23:08.178
Excellent source of Vitamin A,

23:08.261 --> 23:10.222
it can be harvested in
as little as four months.

23:10.305 --> 23:12.682
And we use alkaline water,
so the PH is 6.5.

23:12.766 --> 23:14.226
You've been learning?

23:14.309 --> 23:15.644
A lot actually.

23:17.521 --> 23:21.191
I know working here
isn't the traditional career, but...

23:21.733 --> 23:23.860
it's important, productive work.

23:24.528 --> 23:26.321
And I'm happy!

23:27.155 --> 23:28.865
That's so nice to hear.

23:29.449 --> 23:31.201
It is nice to see some fire in your belly.

23:32.285 --> 23:34.246
Come on, I'll show you around.

23:38.834 --> 23:41.461
<i>The dolphin enjoys
a deep tissue massage.</i>

23:41.545 --> 23:42.671
Wait, for real?

23:45.715 --> 23:46.550
I'm stuck.

23:54.975 --> 23:56.476
Come here. Okay.

23:57.602 --> 23:59.980
Oh, okay.

24:00.063 --> 24:02.065
That was harder
than I thought it was gonna be.

24:02.858 --> 24:04.109
This is the first floor.

24:05.444 --> 24:06.361
Amateur hour.

24:07.404 --> 24:08.447
Steph.

24:10.699 --> 24:12.284
I came to say I'm sorry.

24:13.118 --> 24:16.121
I never wanted to hurt you
or make you feel left behind.

24:18.039 --> 24:19.249
No, I'm sorry.

24:20.500 --> 24:21.668
I love you, Lahela.

24:23.086 --> 24:26.631
I got insecure about losing my best friend
because everybody loves you.

24:27.674 --> 24:31.470
You're a golden child,
a freakin' genius, a dope dancer.

24:31.553 --> 24:33.513
You don't suck on your hair
when you get nervous,

24:33.597 --> 24:36.141
and you can control
the volume of your own voice!

24:39.269 --> 24:40.520
What are you talking about?

24:42.314 --> 24:44.691
I've felt like an outsider my whole life.

24:46.193 --> 24:48.987
This was the first time
I felt like I fit in.

24:49.488 --> 24:51.615
I know, but you're so impressive.

24:53.408 --> 24:56.369
The most impressive thing about me
is you're my best friend.

24:57.537 --> 24:59.122
I don't know. I always had this...

24:59.539 --> 25:02.792
deep down fear that I was gonna lose you
to someone who's actually cool.

25:03.960 --> 25:07.297
But Steph, you are the coolest!

25:08.173 --> 25:12.344
You are the funniest,
most creative girl I know.

25:13.553 --> 25:15.055
And you're my best friend.

25:16.765 --> 25:18.600
No one could replace you.

25:22.729 --> 25:25.398
And if me being
on the dance team hurts you,

25:25.482 --> 25:28.151
then I won't perform with them.

25:28.610 --> 25:29.736
I'm quitting.

25:29.819 --> 25:31.780
What? You can't quit The Royals!

25:31.863 --> 25:33.073
Why? I thought you hated them?

25:33.156 --> 25:35.033
It was a defense mechanism, duh.

25:35.867 --> 25:39.412
I didn't think they'd like a gorgeous
but misunderstood dork like me.

25:40.789 --> 25:43.333
Trust me. They would love you.

25:43.416 --> 25:46.711
Lahela, you're going to that taping.
And so am I.

25:47.712 --> 25:50.298
I wouldn't miss my BFF
bustin' a move with Rip Tide!

25:50.382 --> 25:52.509
Again, he's not dancing.

25:53.593 --> 25:55.053
At least I hope not.

25:57.138 --> 25:58.848
-Don't even say that!
-Yes.

26:00.225 --> 26:03.270
And Mom, Dad.
This is the farm's owner, Akamu.

26:03.353 --> 26:05.897
Great place you got here. It's beautiful!

26:05.981 --> 26:07.190
Thank you.

26:07.774 --> 26:11.778
You know, 40 years ago,
this was a pile of dirt.

26:12.988 --> 26:16.700
It's become what it is today
with the help of farmers like your son.

26:16.783 --> 26:18.618
Yeah, and now this place produces

26:18.702 --> 26:20.954
some of the healthiest organic food
on the island.

26:21.037 --> 26:22.789
There's still a lot of work to be done.

26:23.456 --> 26:25.750
Ninety percent of Hawaii's food
is imported.

26:26.418 --> 26:28.211
But thanks to volunteers,

26:28.295 --> 26:31.965
we're able to provide
locally grown food for our community.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.342
And it's all sustainable.

26:34.926 --> 26:37.679
We take from the Earth
and we give back to the Earth.

26:37.762 --> 26:40.515
Wow, that is so admirable.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.475
How, how did you get into farming?

26:42.559 --> 26:45.729
Well, I studied Agricultural Science
at U of H.

26:46.313 --> 26:51.234
Oh. So you went to college
to pursue this path?

26:51.318 --> 26:52.611
That's interesting.

26:52.694 --> 26:53.987
Of course.

26:54.070 --> 26:55.363
How else do you think I learned

26:55.447 --> 26:58.783
about, uh, plant biology,
and soil chemistry,

26:58.867 --> 27:00.118
and how to manage all this?

27:00.201 --> 27:03.455
So, if someone wants
to get into this field, no pun intended...

27:03.538 --> 27:05.248
-...you'd recommend college?

27:05.332 --> 27:08.543
Oh, yeah, education is important.

27:08.627 --> 27:09.461
Mm.

27:10.170 --> 27:11.546
You got a great son here.

27:12.297 --> 27:13.840
Yeah, we do. Thank you.

27:15.592 --> 27:16.926
You heard Akamu.

27:17.594 --> 27:19.262
You're going to college, my dude.

27:19.346 --> 27:23.475
You can still work here on weekends,
but you're signing up for the next SAT.

27:24.142 --> 27:25.393
Deal.

27:25.477 --> 27:27.354
Well, I kinda left those guys
hanging over there,

27:27.437 --> 27:28.855
so I should probably get to it.

27:31.232 --> 27:32.275
Thanks, guys.

27:33.360 --> 27:34.361
Proud of you.

27:37.405 --> 27:38.448
Kai's gonna be all right.

27:38.531 --> 27:40.492
Yeah.

27:40.575 --> 27:47.207
So, it looks like
we have a doctor, a farmer, and a...

27:51.294 --> 27:53.546
Easy, breezy, beautiful cover boy.

28:06.518 --> 28:08.853
Royals, this is it, babes!

28:08.937 --> 28:09.979
The big moment!

28:10.063 --> 28:12.565
-Let's go!

28:12.982 --> 28:14.359
I think we need a bigger finish.

28:14.442 --> 28:15.902
We should add back in the high kick.

28:16.569 --> 28:20.031
Uh, I don't know about changing
the routine right before the show?

28:20.115 --> 28:22.450
Plus, didn't you say that was dangerous?

28:22.534 --> 28:24.035
Yeah, but trust me.

28:24.119 --> 28:25.537
If you lean forward...

28:27.163 --> 28:29.290
-Oh, I hurt my ankle!

28:29.874 --> 28:32.085
I'm comin'! Mama bear's comin'!

28:35.338 --> 28:38.007
-Here. Careful.
-Thanks, guys.

28:39.050 --> 28:41.428
I think I have
a fibula Maisonneuve fracture.

28:44.889 --> 28:45.765
It's a sprained ankle.

28:47.434 --> 28:48.643
I don't think I can dance.

28:50.145 --> 28:51.521
Huh?

28:51.604 --> 28:52.772
Did you hurt your eye too?

28:52.856 --> 28:55.734
What are we gonna do?
The dance is for seven girls.

28:55.817 --> 28:57.110
I guess we have to cancel.

28:57.193 --> 29:00.321
Wait! Steph can take my place!

29:00.905 --> 29:01.740
Me?

29:02.073 --> 29:02.907
This Steph?

29:02.991 --> 29:04.325
Yes, you!

29:04.409 --> 29:05.952
She's been watching us practice.

29:06.035 --> 29:08.705
Plus, she's my BFF. She can do anything.

29:11.207 --> 29:12.417
Great idea!

29:12.500 --> 29:15.086
I can vouch for her, babes,
Steph's got moves!

29:15.170 --> 29:18.590
-Cool. Great.
-So, Steph, do you wanna join The Royals?

29:21.259 --> 29:24.387
Yes! This is literally my dream come true.

29:24.471 --> 29:25.305
I've dreamt this.

29:25.388 --> 29:28.850
Really? I thought you hated us.

29:28.933 --> 29:31.102
You always, like,
scowl at me in the hallway.

29:32.353 --> 29:34.439
Yeah, about that...

29:35.648 --> 29:37.650
Olivia, do you know what neurosis is?

29:39.194 --> 29:42.071
Here. You are going to need this.

29:44.616 --> 29:47.368
-Welcome, babe.

29:47.452 --> 29:49.204
It's your boy, it's your weatherman,

29:49.287 --> 29:53.166
it's your local adrenaline
junkie Rip Tide, comin' at you live!

29:53.249 --> 29:54.125
Due to budget cuts,

29:54.209 --> 29:57.003
I'm now also covering sports,
community outreach, and homicide.

29:57.086 --> 30:00.256
But we've got something special tonight,
and it's not a murder.

30:00.340 --> 30:05.512
The five-time regional champs,
the Liliuokalani High Dance Team!

30:05.595 --> 30:06.638
Hit it, girls!

30:28.785 --> 30:30.537
-Go Steph!

30:30.620 --> 30:32.705
-That's my best friend! Whoo!

30:37.126 --> 30:39.295
-Hey!

30:41.923 --> 30:43.174
Go, Raya!

30:46.094 --> 30:48.179
-Yeah!

30:55.395 --> 30:57.856
-Go, Steph!

30:57.939 --> 30:59.858
-Go, Steph!

31:02.193 --> 31:06.614
I'm not a normal doctor or a typical teen.

31:07.699 --> 31:11.202
Being stuck between two worlds
can be pretty isolating.

31:11.286 --> 31:14.163
Sometimes I feel like I'm left out
everywhere I go.

31:15.039 --> 31:17.542
But I was so focused on trying to fit in

31:17.625 --> 31:20.795
that I lost sight
of where I fit in all along.

31:21.796 --> 31:24.132
You down to put that twist 'n' roll
on the Tok, babe?

31:24.215 --> 31:26.259
For you, babe? Always.

31:28.177 --> 31:29.262
All right.

31:29.929 --> 31:30.972
You ready?

31:31.347 --> 31:32.891
Please.

31:56.497 --> 31:58.082
-That was good.
-We did it!
