02:03.320 --> 02:04.958
Previously on Married With Children:

02:05.200 --> 02:08.829
Bud and his frat brothers
had tick ets to spring break.

02:15.080 --> 02:18.709
Kelly and her girlfriends trick ed them
out of their tick ets to Fort Lauderdale.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.197
Kelly's running for Miss Spring Break.
Jefferson is one of the judges.

02:26.400 --> 02:29.870
Al and Griff didn't need
much convincing to join Jefferson.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.675
Which inspired Marcie, Bud
and his cool friends to head south.

02:38.920 --> 02:40.672
Road trip.

02:43.320 --> 02:45.515
Destination, Fort Lauderdale.

02:47.960 --> 02:50.190
So now thanks to
state-of-the-art graphics...

02:50.400 --> 02:52.356
... courtesy of Columbia Pictures
Television.

02:52.600 --> 02:55.319
Let's rejoin Married With Children.

03:16.080 --> 03:18.958
Will you idiots shut up?

03:19.200 --> 03:22.033
Sorry, Mrs. D 'Arcy, we're just trying
to tak e our minds off...

03:22.240 --> 03:24.549
... what Kelly and the easy riders
did to us.

03:24.800 --> 03:27.314
Well, it's a long drive
to Fort Lauderdale.

03:27.520 --> 03:31.399
So I suggest
that you enjoy the beauty...

03:31.640 --> 03:35.474
... of this great country of ours.

03:49.720 --> 03:51.199
Thanks for the game of chicken.

03:51.440 --> 03:52.839
See you guys at the hot tub.

03:53.040 --> 03:55.270
-All right.
-All right.

03:55.480 --> 03:59.075
Gentlemen,
is this not the greatest day...

03:59.280 --> 04:01.191
...of our shoulders, necks
and backs?

04:03.160 --> 04:04.673
This is the life.

04:04.920 --> 04:09.675
A vacation paid for with money
from a fraternity-scholarship fund.

04:09.960 --> 04:11.632
lt doesn't get any better than this.

04:12.160 --> 04:14.469
lt just did.

04:15.600 --> 04:19.957
Here you go, gents.
Compliments of the girls in the hot tub.

04:22.280 --> 04:23.918
Hi there.

04:25.240 --> 04:29.392
And here you go, miss.

04:32.840 --> 04:35.400
Compliments
of some needy kid's education.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.631
Now, see, that's my idea of marriage.

04:40.880 --> 04:45.431
A gorgeous girl keeps me buzzed all
the time while the wife's out of town.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.479
That settles it.

04:49.720 --> 04:52.678
Al Bundy is moving
to Fort Lauderdale.

04:55.240 --> 04:57.913
That's a nice fantasy, Al.
But what about your job?

04:58.160 --> 05:01.072
Well, l'll just get
some other profession. l'll....

05:01.320 --> 05:04.312
Here, l'll sell cans.

05:04.560 --> 05:07.791
l'll make more money selling cans
than l ever made selling shoes.

05:08.080 --> 05:09.593
You couldn't make less.

05:11.280 --> 05:15.796
Hey, guys, l say we go up to our suite,
slap on a little more Hai Karate...

05:16.000 --> 05:18.673
...and join the babes in the hot tub.

05:19.680 --> 05:22.877
Hai Karate, the cologne
that chicks just can't resist.

05:36.280 --> 05:38.396
What's that funky smell?

05:38.640 --> 05:41.916
lt smells like geezer.

05:42.160 --> 05:44.549
Hey, you guys,
l'm starting to get a little nervous...

05:44.760 --> 05:46.159
...about this pageant tomorrow.

05:46.360 --> 05:49.193
l mean, l've never been in one
that turned out to be real.

05:50.600 --> 05:53.114
Kelly, the key
is to impress the judges.

05:53.360 --> 05:56.352
Okay, first you walk prim and proper
down the runway...

05:56.560 --> 05:59.154
...to show the judges
that you have class...

05:59.360 --> 06:02.511
...and then you shake your
money maker to get their votes.

06:07.720 --> 06:09.233
Okay, then what?

06:09.800 --> 06:11.028
Talent.

06:11.240 --> 06:13.310
l suggest how many licks
of a Tootsie Pop...

06:13.560 --> 06:17.155
...does it take to make you
Miss Spring Break.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.394
This also works if you're ever
pulled over for speeding.

06:25.040 --> 06:27.793
Then they're gonna ask you
some politically correct question.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.629
You just answer, '' l wanna save
the earth and the ozone layer.''

06:31.880 --> 06:35.111
Okay. What's the ozone layer?

06:35.400 --> 06:39.075
lt's between the N-zone
and the P-zone layer.

06:39.560 --> 06:41.437
Yeah, we got to save that.

06:41.680 --> 06:44.353
And the earth, too,
because once the earth goes...

06:44.600 --> 06:46.716
...the planet's gonna be next.

06:47.480 --> 06:50.199
There's guys coming.

07:08.080 --> 07:10.071
Well, howdy, folks.

07:10.400 --> 07:13.153
Parley Wayne, at your service.

07:13.400 --> 07:16.756
Hi. My German-luxury sedan
is broken down...

07:16.960 --> 07:19.952
...after running over
one of your state birds...

07:21.120 --> 07:22.872
...the possum.

07:24.080 --> 07:25.433
l'll be needing a tow truck.

07:25.720 --> 07:29.030
Well, hell, l'd like a tow truck too.

07:29.600 --> 07:33.354
l'd also like a new wife
and some more teeth.

07:33.600 --> 07:36.637
Look, ZZ Top.

07:37.880 --> 07:39.871
We have got to get to Florida.

07:40.520 --> 07:44.832
You keep on calling me names
and you just might land there.

07:47.960 --> 07:49.598
Look, Mr. Wayne--

07:49.880 --> 07:53.555
No. Parley Wayne
is my first name.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.108
Last name is Rockefeller.

07:57.880 --> 08:00.792
l had to drop it though.
l couldn't spell it.

08:02.960 --> 08:04.996
Look, there's got to be a way
out of here.

08:05.200 --> 08:07.998
l mean, a car, bicycle...

08:08.680 --> 08:10.636
...horse you're not dating
at the moment.

08:12.720 --> 08:15.757
-You know, l do have a truck for rent?
-How much do you want?

08:16.040 --> 08:21.512
A $1 000
and leave the fat boy here.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.038
That is an outrage.

08:30.280 --> 08:32.999
Yeah, we don't have $1 000.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.832
The heck with him.
We'll just walk to the next mechanic.

08:42.080 --> 08:45.072
-Now, where would that be?
-Memphis.

08:46.760 --> 08:50.799
You know,
I sure am gonna miss Hummer.

08:53.160 --> 08:54.878
Yeah, but on the bright side...

08:55.120 --> 08:58.908
... the back seat will no longer smell
lik e Sweet Tarts.

09:08.400 --> 09:11.790
You might remember me
from Desert Storm.

09:13.480 --> 09:16.790
l'm former-presidential hopeful,
Colin Powell.

09:17.600 --> 09:20.319
l was gonna throw my support
behind you.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.120
Well, you still can.

09:24.760 --> 09:26.557
Jefferson,
my life has never been better.

09:26.760 --> 09:29.115
l already made 3 bucks
collecting cans.

09:29.360 --> 09:33.717
The babes don't realize
that while l'm dancing, l'm working.

09:34.720 --> 09:37.598
We are so cool.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.560
-Excuse me, Kelly.
-lt's okay, Dad.

09:49.520 --> 09:51.238
Pumpkin, what are you doing here?

09:51.480 --> 09:54.392
l'm in the Miss Spring Break pageant.
What are you doing here?

09:55.040 --> 09:56.553
l live here.

09:58.040 --> 10:00.554
Hey, Kelly,
who are your dad's friends?

10:00.800 --> 10:02.916
Well, we're Al's good buddies.

10:03.160 --> 10:05.515
l'm Wesley Snipes.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.876
And l'm...

10:09.080 --> 10:11.116
...Woody Harrelson.

10:11.640 --> 10:12.868
Oh, my God.

10:13.080 --> 10:16.516
l loved you guys
in White Men Can't Jump.

10:18.720 --> 10:24.078
Oh, my God, isn't that George Clooney
star of that hit TV show ER.

10:27.440 --> 10:30.193
So, Daddy, are you gonna come see me
in the pageant tomorrow?

10:30.440 --> 10:33.477
No, Kelly, l'm not.
No self-respecting can-man...

10:33.680 --> 10:36.114
...would watch his only daughter
be gawked at...

10:36.360 --> 10:40.114
...by a bunch of drunken riffraff
for cheap prizes.

10:40.600 --> 10:43.319
lt means $1 00,000 to us, Daddy.

10:45.440 --> 10:48.512
Here, take some cans.
Go buy yourself a bikini.

11:05.400 --> 11:08.358
Man, you know, if l started this
right out of high school...

11:08.560 --> 11:11.836
...imagine how many cans
l'd have by now.

11:12.080 --> 11:14.548
What am l talking about?
l don't need cans.

11:14.800 --> 11:18.634
Once you win this pageant,
l'm not gonna be Can-Man anymore.

11:18.880 --> 11:21.269
l'm gonna be Hundred-Grand Man.

11:22.200 --> 11:26.637
Well, Daddy, l feel good.
l feel strong. l think l can win.

11:33.960 --> 11:36.235
Daddy, you got to do something.

11:36.640 --> 11:38.073
Kelly...

11:38.280 --> 11:41.875
...we met the cutest lifeguards.

11:43.040 --> 11:44.632
And they want to share
a keg with us.

11:44.840 --> 11:47.513
But only one because we're on duty.

11:51.520 --> 11:54.114
Hey, how's it going, Can-Man?

11:54.360 --> 11:56.715
Here. Just great.

11:56.960 --> 11:59.428
Jefferson, l'm counting on you
to vote for Kelly.

11:59.720 --> 12:02.280
Yeah, you got my vote, Al.
But there are five judges.

12:02.480 --> 12:04.994
-She needs three votes to win.
-So who are the judges?

12:05.240 --> 12:07.151
A couple
former pageant winners...

12:07.360 --> 12:10.158
...and two of my fraternity brothers,
Wong and DeAngelo.

12:10.440 --> 12:13.557
Well, that's no problem.
We slip them 50 each and Kelly's in.

12:14.600 --> 12:18.673
Al, brothers Wong and DeAngelo
are beyond reproach.

12:23.040 --> 12:25.474
Beyond reproach
and rounding second base.

12:25.720 --> 12:28.234
Jefferson, you've got to name
me and Griff as judges.

12:28.520 --> 12:30.511
l don't know.
The only way that can happen...

12:30.720 --> 12:33.314
...is if two of the other judges
became incapacitated.

12:36.760 --> 12:39.069
You might remember me from TV.

12:39.280 --> 12:42.431
l used to play Theo
on The Cosby Show.

12:44.360 --> 12:45.918
l love you.

12:46.160 --> 12:48.879
l used to kiss the TV
whenever you came on.

12:53.520 --> 12:55.556
Theo...

12:56.720 --> 12:58.631
...l need to talk to you, alone,
right now.

12:58.840 --> 13:02.150
Not now, Al,
l'm with my number-one fan.

13:02.560 --> 13:05.358
This involves 1 00,000 bucks.

13:05.600 --> 13:07.397
Bye-bye.

13:10.000 --> 13:15.074
Excuse us, gentlemen. Would you come
here a second? Right this way, pal.

13:31.400 --> 13:35.109
Thanks for coming back to get me,
guys.

13:39.600 --> 13:41.636
Actually,
we just came back for gas...

13:41.840 --> 13:44.434
...and you happen to be there
pulling a plough.

13:46.600 --> 13:49.239
Wearing a bridal veil.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.275
It was hot out.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.072
Will someone turn on the radio?

13:58.520 --> 14:01.990
Jim Dixson reporting from the Miss
Spring Break Pageant, Fort Lauderdale.

14:02.240 --> 14:04.515
I'm with one of the judges.
What is your name, sir?

14:04.760 --> 14:07.035
Jefferson D 'Arcy.

14:07.560 --> 14:11.838
I'm single and free to mingle.

14:16.880 --> 14:20.190
Welcome everyone to the 6th annual
Miss Spring Break Contest.

14:20.440 --> 14:24.752
Sponsored by the new children's
breakfast cereal, Nothing But Sugar.

14:25.200 --> 14:27.077
Now with Ritalin.

14:30.320 --> 14:35.075
And l'm your MC, popular rock-TV VJ,
star of three busted pilots for Fox...

14:35.320 --> 14:38.517
...Dangerous Dan lnwood.

14:40.640 --> 14:42.119
Thank you.

14:42.840 --> 14:45.308
Before we bring out the babes,
let's meet our judges.

14:45.560 --> 14:48.154
Representing RTV are former
Miss Spring Break winners...

14:48.400 --> 14:52.518
...Missy Cameron
and Tammy Grindstaff-Burke.

14:55.760 --> 15:00.356
What was first prize back then,
1 00 grand worth of chocolate coins?

15:04.120 --> 15:07.157
Our next judge,
frat-boy extraordinaire:

15:07.400 --> 15:12.315
Mr. Jefferson D'Arcy.
And ladies, he's single.

15:16.160 --> 15:18.720
Thank you.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.872
Our next judge comes to us
all the way from Taiwan...

15:25.040 --> 15:27.713
...Mr. Miyagi Wong.

15:33.880 --> 15:36.474
And our last judge,
from Fire lsland...

15:36.720 --> 15:41.350
...an organizer of last year's,
Gay Prance on Washington...

15:42.360 --> 15:45.670
...Carmine '' Cha-cha'' DeAngelo.

15:52.360 --> 15:54.271
Now, let's meet our five contestants.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.470
Miss New York, Claudia Harrison.

16:01.720 --> 16:05.269

16:07.760 --> 16:11.116
Miss Detroit, Marla Strong.

16:13.600 --> 16:17.149
Miss Beverly Hills, Angela Cohen.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.550
Well, she's got my vote.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.117
Sorry, Al,
it was a moment of weakness.

16:30.720 --> 16:32.995
How much for a lap dance?

16:34.240 --> 16:35.798
Hey.

16:38.920 --> 16:43.152
And our final contestant,
Miss Chicago, Kelly Bundy.

16:46.480 --> 16:49.119
Go, Kelly. Go, Kelly. Go, Kelly.

16:49.360 --> 16:51.351
All right.

16:51.600 --> 16:54.831
Let's begin
with the talent competition.

17:46.640 --> 17:51.509
Ladies and gentlemen, may l direct
your attention to the centre stage...

17:51.760 --> 17:57.232
...Miss Chicago
will now blow a bubble.

18:14.880 --> 18:17.997
And now, Miss Beverly Hills...

18:18.240 --> 18:22.392
...will eat a banana.

18:31.600 --> 18:35.070
Maybe she's got a cute brother,
Cha-cha.

18:41.280 --> 18:44.352
Okay, ladies, you've proven yourselves
to be incredibly beautiful...

18:44.560 --> 18:45.834
...as well as very talented.

18:46.040 --> 18:49.476
So now let's see
what you've got upstairs.

18:50.280 --> 18:54.034
No, no, no, no, no, no. No. No.
No, l mean, let's move...

18:54.240 --> 18:56.674
...to the question-and-answer part
of the competition.

18:56.880 --> 18:59.838
We'll begin with you, Miss Detroit.
Now, your question is:

19:00.040 --> 19:02.679
''What would you do
to end world hunger?''

19:02.920 --> 19:04.956
l would tell the hungry people
of the world...

19:05.200 --> 19:08.078
...to take smaller bites
and chew your food thoroughly.

19:08.320 --> 19:11.471
That way, your food will last longer.

19:13.080 --> 19:15.719
Now, Miss Chicago,
your question is:

19:15.960 --> 19:19.839
''What world leader
do you most admire?''

19:20.600 --> 19:24.434
l would like to save the earth
and the ozone layer. Thank you.

19:25.680 --> 19:27.716
No. Thank you.

19:31.080 --> 19:34.231
Well, now, let's keep things bouncing
with the swim suit competition.

19:34.440 --> 19:37.352
We'll begin with Miss Beverly Hills.

19:44.360 --> 19:47.875
Vote for me and l'll marry you.

19:51.160 --> 19:55.278
Al, l'm voting for Angela, my new wife,
and don't try to stop me.

19:56.520 --> 19:58.909
Now, look what happened to you.

19:59.160 --> 20:01.549
You see what you made me
go and do?

20:01.800 --> 20:03.552
l didn't want to do it.

20:03.840 --> 20:09.915
And, now, this year's
Miss Spring Break is...

20:10.160 --> 20:12.435
...Kelly Bundy.

20:17.080 --> 20:18.559
No more cans for me.

20:18.800 --> 20:22.031
From now on,
l just pick up champagne bottles.

20:22.280 --> 20:26.876
And here to present you with your
prize, TV heartthrob Joey Lawrence.

20:39.680 --> 20:41.272
You know, Joey, without make up...

20:41.480 --> 20:45.109
...you kind of look like
my dorky brother, Bud.

20:49.120 --> 20:52.749
l am Bud, you beach-blanket bimbo.

20:53.200 --> 20:56.829
Yeah, you and the three slut-kateers
thought you could just rip us off...

20:57.080 --> 20:59.071
...and leave us freezing in Chicago?

20:59.360 --> 21:02.272
Well, yeah.

21:02.840 --> 21:05.832
Well, think again. No one plays
Bud Bundy and gets away with it.

21:06.080 --> 21:08.958
Yeah, yeah, whatever.
Could you cry about this later, Bud?

21:09.200 --> 21:11.077
l'm about to be crowned
Miss Spring Break.

21:11.280 --> 21:13.714
So get off the stage
so l can get my prize.

21:14.480 --> 21:18.917
Okay, sure. l'd be happy to,
but first...

21:19.160 --> 21:22.391
...ladies and gentlemen, l want
to apologize for taking up your time.

21:23.040 --> 21:28.558
l, Joey Lawrence, would just like
to congratulate you, Kelly Bundy...

21:28.800 --> 21:32.793
...and judges Wong,
DeAngelo and D'Arcy...

21:33.040 --> 21:38.717
...otherwise known as her father,
his shoe-selling sidekick...

21:38.960 --> 21:41.520
...and our soon to be choked out
next-door neighbour.

21:47.760 --> 21:49.432
ls that better, Kel?

21:51.480 --> 21:56.793
Well, l guess my brother,
Martin Lawrence...

21:58.200 --> 21:59.872
...has thanked just about everybody.

22:00.080 --> 22:04.073
So l guess it's time for me
to collect my prize...

22:04.280 --> 22:08.114
...and sing my coronation song, right?
Okay.

22:17.960 --> 22:20.713
There they are. Let's get them.

22:23.520 --> 22:25.988
Mr. Bundy, you're being charged
with fraud and assault.

22:26.240 --> 22:30.552
-Would you like a lawyer?
-Do you know any that take cans?

22:31.305 --> 22:37.588
