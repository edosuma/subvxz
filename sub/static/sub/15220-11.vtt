Theorising that one could time travel
within his own lifetime,

00:29.279 --> 00:32.908
Doctor Sam Beckett stepped into the
quantum leap accelerator

00:32.908 --> 00:34.952
and vanished.

00:39.831 --> 00:42.376
He woke to find himself trapped in
the past,

00:42.376 --> 00:44.920
facing mirror images that were not
his own...

00:45.963 --> 00:51.426
and driven by an unknown force to
change history for the better.

00:51.426 --> 00:55.389
His only guide on this journey is Al,
an observer from his own time,

00:55.389 --> 01:00.352
who appears in the form of a hologram
that only Sam can see and hear.

01:00.352 --> 01:04.022
And so Doctor Beckett finds himself
leaping from life to life,

01:04.022 --> 01:07.442
striving to put right what once went
wrong,

01:07.442 --> 01:12.823
and hoping each time that his next
leap will be the leap home.

14:57.278 --> 15:00.990
Why don't you all come over for
dinner? That would be wonderful.

15:00.990 --> 15:05.078
Oh, God, it's great seeing you
again, Billy. You, too, Emma.

15:06.204 --> 15:09.874
Come on, scout, let's go find your
sister. Take it easy, Butchie.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.671
The good news was, Emma was still
with her family. The bad news...

15:23.671 --> 15:26.507
You're over, you're over! Mom,
Butchie's over!

15:26.507 --> 15:28.759
..so was I.
Butchie, you know better.

15:28.759 --> 15:30.886
He's over, he's over!
Over what?

15:30.886 --> 15:33.806
On my side! His shoes are covered
with monkey do.

15:33.806 --> 15:36.016
Have a cow, why don't you?

15:36.016 --> 15:37.559

him again.

That's because you're a moron.

your brother a moron.

16:45.210 --> 16:47.379

save this family and re-body.

Mm-hm.

You can't stop, Sam.
No, no, it wasn't.

18:05.415 --> 18:08.377
Yes, it was.
I'm sure it wasn't.

18:08.377 --> 18:12.297

to stop and go back and help them.

It's not his decision, it's yours.
You don't know how he'll react yet.

25:27.946 --> 25:30.823
What? No, no way.

This is weird, Al, no matter what we
do, we keep running into him.

26:39.934 --> 26:42.270
Maybe she told him where you were
going.

26:42.270 --> 26:44.397
Maybe sometimes you can't fight
fate.

26:45.273 --> 26:47.358
Well, you have to, Sam.
How?

26:48.362 --> 26:50.406
I'm a kid, nobody listens to me.

26:50.865 --> 26:53.659
All I do is, I get teased and
ignored.

26:53.659 --> 26:57.329
You've dealt with a lot tougher guys
than that bozo over there.

26:57.329 --> 27:00.458
It would be easier if this guy Bill
were a jerk but he's not.

27:00.458 --> 27:03.836
He's actually a pretty OK guy.
Well, so's Hank.

27:03.836 --> 27:07.882
Hey, it's 1964, guys were different
then but they're gonna change.

27:07.882 --> 27:10.634
I don't know.
You've got to give Hank a chance,

27:10.634 --> 27:13.345
cos if you don't Alex gets pregnant
in two years

27:13.345 --> 27:16.015
and Butchie doesn't even finish high
school.

27:16.015 --> 27:18.684
If she leaves, she destroys the whole
family.

27:18.684 --> 27:22.396
What happens to her? I don't know,
we don't have any data on Emma.

27:22.396 --> 27:24.815
Just that sometime tonight she runs
away.

27:24.815 --> 27:26.776
Even if I stop her, who's to say

27:26.776 --> 27:29.070
that she's gonna wait for Hank to
change?

27:30.613 --> 27:32.823
Maybe you're right, maybe any mother

27:32.823 --> 27:35.117
that leaves her kids isn't worth
saving.

27:38.579 --> 27:41.499
You're taking this personally,
aren't you, Al? No!

27:43.042 --> 27:46.295
All right, yeah, maybe I am. My dad
wasn't there for my mom.

27:47.087 --> 27:50.049
So sometimes I could understand that
she left him.

27:50.049 --> 27:54.178
But she left Trudy and me, too, and I
could never understand that.

27:55.888 --> 27:57.932
So uh...

27:59.266 --> 28:01.602
..just make sure they stay together,
Sam.

28:04.313 --> 28:08.484
Al? I promise you I'll do whatever I
can to keep Emma here.

28:09.109 --> 28:11.153
OK.

28:14.990 --> 28:17.827

again, huh?

28:17.827 --> 28:21.580

baby.

28:29.088 --> 28:31.257
Hey, stop it, he didn't do anything.

28:31.257 --> 28:34.468
He put his hand on your leg.
Come on, Hank.

28:34.468 --> 28:37.429
Oh! Been a while, hey, Doc?

28:37.429 --> 28:40.182
What's wrong?
Butchie, go back to the cabin.

28:40.182 --> 28:42.309
Hank, he didn't do anything.

28:42.309 --> 28:45.521
I saw him put his hand on your leg!

28:45.521 --> 28:48.524
She made a joke, I patted her on the
knee, that's all.

28:48.524 --> 28:51.026
Yeah, and then you left it there.

28:51.026 --> 28:55.155
I think we've all had a little too
much to drink. Let's call it a day.

28:55.155 --> 28:57.157
After we settle this.
Hank!

28:58.450 --> 29:00.494
Ohhh!

29:01.495 --> 29:05.040
It's not high school, Hank. You
can't solve everything with a fight.

29:05.040 --> 29:07.084
Well, just stay away from my wife.

29:11.588 --> 29:13.632
And you stay away from me.

29:35.321 --> 29:38.365
What do you know about women? You're
only 13 years old.

29:41.660 --> 29:43.704
I know about Mom.

29:46.332 --> 29:50.169
You said yesterday that everybody
deserves a fair chance.

29:50.169 --> 29:52.838
Yeah, I was talking about minorities.

29:55.007 --> 29:58.052
Women deserve equal rights, too,
Dad. Equal rights!

29:58.052 --> 30:00.095
I mean, maybe...

30:01.555 --> 30:03.640
..one day, they're going to fight

30:03.640 --> 30:06.310
for their own sort of Civil Rights
Act.

30:07.144 --> 30:09.396
What the hell's gotten into you,
scout?

30:09.938 --> 30:11.899
Nothing. Nothing. I just...

30:11.899 --> 30:14.234
I just think that if Mom wants to go
to college

30:14.234 --> 30:16.403
she should get a chance, that's all.

30:16.403 --> 30:18.697
I already give her everything she
needs.

30:19.615 --> 30:21.909
The Vista Cruiser, the colour Zenith.

30:21.909 --> 30:24.161
She doesn't know it yet but I just
got her

30:24.161 --> 30:26.455
a full-carat rock for our 15th this
month.

30:26.455 --> 30:28.624
Yeah, those are just...

30:28.624 --> 30:30.709
This month?
Yeah, it's as big -

30:30.709 --> 30:32.878
Alex is 14Â½.

30:32.878 --> 30:35.756
Oh...
She's not going to be 15 for -

30:35.756 --> 30:37.800
Yeah, I...I...I meant...

30:38.592 --> 30:40.636
I meant, our 16th.

30:42.971 --> 30:45.015
Mom was pregnant.

30:45.474 --> 30:48.936
She didn't go to North-Western
because she was pregnant with Alex.

30:48.936 --> 30:52.314
You just keep talking, mister, and
I'll put you over my knee.

30:53.440 --> 30:56.985
Afraid she wouldn't come back if she
went to college with Bill?

30:57.611 --> 30:59.655
Oh, Dad!

31:00.197 --> 31:02.241
Butchie, your mom...

31:04.910 --> 31:06.954
She's the only woman I ever loved.

31:08.163 --> 31:10.249
But don't you see? You'll lose her

31:10.249 --> 31:12.876
if you don't start listening to what
she needs.

31:14.378 --> 31:16.421
Well...

31:21.385 --> 31:23.554
I'll make you a deal, son.

31:23.554 --> 31:25.556
I'll talk to your mom.
Great.

31:26.640 --> 31:28.684
If you beat me back to the camp.

31:30.477 --> 31:32.646
Dad...

31:32.646 --> 31:36.525
Honey, we're finally doing so well.
We got the new house, two cars...

31:37.568 --> 31:39.945
We're getting a pool in the spring.

31:39.945 --> 31:42.239
I don't want any stuff. Don't you
hear me?

31:42.781 --> 31:44.825
I feel like I'm going crazy.

31:45.867 --> 31:47.995
OK.

31:47.995 --> 31:50.455
OK, then, can you just tell me this.

31:50.455 --> 31:52.499
What do you want?

31:54.084 --> 31:56.128
I want to stop feeling...

31:58.880 --> 32:01.925
like a non-person.
A non-person?!

32:01.925 --> 32:05.971
Yeah. I owe it to myself to do what's
best for me.

32:07.347 --> 32:10.309
Hell, no. I want my own life!

32:13.604 --> 32:15.731
Your own life?

32:15.731 --> 32:17.774
Are you saying you want to split up?

32:18.984 --> 32:21.111
No, Hank, no. I love you, you know
that.

32:24.239 --> 32:27.492
It's just that I feel like some part
of me is dying.

32:27.909 --> 32:29.953
(SIGHS)

32:30.621 --> 32:32.748
I haven't done anything with my life.

32:33.332 --> 32:35.500
Yes, you did, you had two kids!

32:35.500 --> 32:38.754
But this isn't about our kids, or our
family.

32:38.754 --> 32:42.466
I just... I thought that the deal
was that I make the money

32:42.466 --> 32:44.634
and you make the happy home.

32:44.634 --> 32:48.805
Well, I made a happy home. I've made
a happy home for 15 years

32:48.805 --> 32:53.435
and now what? Everybody goes away and
I sit home, waiting.

32:53.935 --> 32:56.063
I don't want to wait any more.

32:56.063 --> 32:58.106
I want to...

32:59.232 --> 33:01.651
I want to do something for me.

33:02.944 --> 33:05.113
You know, Emma,

33:05.113 --> 33:07.324
you're not crazy, you're just
selfish.

33:08.325 --> 33:10.369
Then I'm not alone.

33:11.244 --> 33:14.206
There are other women like me and
we're all sick of...

33:15.290 --> 33:19.586
Oh, we're sick of shopping and making
brownies for our living.

33:21.380 --> 33:23.423
I'm sorry, but...

33:25.383 --> 33:28.345
I don't have an orgasm waxing the
damn kitchen floor.

33:33.391 --> 33:35.519
Is that... Is that what that book
says?

33:44.653 --> 33:46.655
That's what I think of the damn
book!

33:59.918 --> 34:01.962
(OWL HOOTS)

34:03.421 --> 34:07.592
I told you she'd run away. Go find
Alex. Fireworks start in 20 minutes.

34:07.592 --> 34:10.637
Where'd she go?
I don't know, out there somewhere,

34:10.637 --> 34:13.764
trying to do what's best for her.
I don't know, I guess

34:13.764 --> 34:17.143
she got tired of being a non-person.

34:18.812 --> 34:22.524
Dad, Dad, we got to find her. Look,
your mom has been running away

34:22.524 --> 34:25.443
since the ninth grade. Believe me,
she'll be back.

34:25.443 --> 34:27.612
Not this time.

34:27.612 --> 34:29.656
I said she'll be back!

34:31.533 --> 34:33.577
Not unless we find her.

34:49.967 --> 34:52.012
(TYRES SQUEAL)

34:54.848 --> 34:57.100
What are you doing?
I thought that...

34:57.100 --> 35:00.312
Emma was with you.
So did I.

35:00.312 --> 35:02.856
She was, a few minutes ago.
I'm sorry, Sam.

35:02.856 --> 35:05.692
What happened? She came by the cabin
very upset.

35:05.692 --> 35:09.904
We talked, we decided it was best if
we stayed at separate camps grounds.

35:09.904 --> 35:12.949
I just assumed she ran off with Bill.
What happened to her?

35:12.949 --> 35:16.328
We said our goodbyes. We didn't
research far enough back.

35:16.328 --> 35:19.581
Just tell me where she is. I dropped
her at the fire road,

35:19.581 --> 35:22.626
she said she wanted to go for a
walk. In 1993 a woman's

35:22.626 --> 35:26.296
skeletal remains were found at the
base of Devil's Backbone. No!

35:26.504 --> 35:29.758
It's just down the road.
The dental charts match Emma.

35:29.758 --> 35:31.885
Dad -
Get in this car, scout.

35:31.885 --> 35:34.012
Mom's in trouble.
What?

35:34.012 --> 35:35.764
She's gonna die.
What the hell -

35:35.764 --> 35:39.225
I can't explain it. We got to get to
the Devil's Backbone now!

35:39.225 --> 35:41.269
Please!

35:45.273 --> 35:47.317
I don't see her.

35:50.070 --> 35:52.113
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

35:53.073 --> 35:56.826
Work with me, Al! The remains were
found at the base of that ridge.

35:56.826 --> 35:58.995
Dad, I don't see her.

35:58.995 --> 36:02.499
You need rope! Dad, trust me, she's
down there. Got any rope?

36:02.499 --> 36:04.626
Yeah.
Bring it.

36:04.626 --> 36:08.838
Gooshie, centre me on Emma! I don't
care where she is, just do it.

36:10.173 --> 36:12.217
God!

36:13.510 --> 36:15.595
Hurry up, Sam, she's right down
here.

36:18.181 --> 36:20.308

here, she's slipping.

36:32.070 --> 36:34.072
Mom, hang on.
Emma!

36:34.572 --> 36:37.367
Out of the way, scout.
You'll need my help, Dad.

36:37.367 --> 36:39.536
Hang on, honey!

36:39.536 --> 36:43.373
Oh, my God! Hold the flashlight.
Give me the rope, give me the rope.

36:43.373 --> 36:45.542
Hang on, Mom!

36:45.542 --> 36:48.586
OK, honey, I'm going to throw you a
rope. Hurry, Sam!

36:48.586 --> 36:51.881
Mom, don't let go. Bill, I'm going to
need your help here.

36:51.881 --> 36:54.008
I think maybe we should get the
Ranger.

36:56.427 --> 36:58.555
OK, go.

36:58.555 --> 37:00.306
Go!

37:00.306 --> 37:02.433
OK, honey.

37:02.433 --> 37:04.686
Here comes the rope!
(FIREWORKS BANG)

37:07.230 --> 37:10.483
OK, Emma. Make her grab the rope,
make her grab the rope.

37:10.483 --> 37:13.570
Emma, grab the rope!
Mom, grab it!

37:13.570 --> 37:16.489
Grab the rope, Mom.
Right next to your hand, honey.

37:18.867 --> 37:20.618
She's frozen, Sam.

37:20.618 --> 37:23.621
Shine the light on the rope.
She's not moving, Dad.

37:23.621 --> 37:25.748
Oh, God.
Dad, do something!

37:25.748 --> 37:28.751
We can use the tree. I'll try the
rope round my waist,

37:28.751 --> 37:30.795
you can lower me down.

37:31.171 --> 37:35.049
OK, good thinking, scout. Oh, God,
Daddy, what - Honey, get down.

37:35.049 --> 37:37.886
Get down here now. Point the light
right on Mommy.

37:37.886 --> 37:41.347
Hold that light there, don't let it
move. Can you do that? Yes.

37:42.015 --> 37:44.058
OK, let's go.

don't knock any rocks.

hands around my shoulders.

44:12.848 --> 44:17.061
Not until you promise to never tease
or abuse your little brother again.

44:17.061 --> 44:20.272
That means no Charlie Horses, no
noogies, no wedgies,

44:20.272 --> 44:24.193
no ear flicks and no purple nipples.
OK, OK!

44:24.193 --> 44:26.737
You promise?
(ECHOES) I promise, I promise!

44:27.613 --> 44:29.657
Come on!

44:36.955 --> 44:39.041
(SAM CHUCKLES)

44:43.337 --> 44:45.422
You know, Butchie.
Huh?

44:45.422 --> 44:47.466
You're all right, for a twerp.

45:35.139 --> 45:37.182
Oh, boy!
