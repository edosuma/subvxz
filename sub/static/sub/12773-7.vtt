<i>Beauty & the Beast...</i>

00:02.013 --> 00:02.801
<i>Someone's willing to pay</i>

00:02.802 --> 00:05.270
$5 million to capture a beast.
There's a bounty?

00:05.370 --> 00:08.009
They may be after a beast, but
they do not know it's Vincent.

00:08.010 --> 00:09.878
But I do.
And I'm covering for him.

00:09.978 --> 00:11.278
I don't think that
now is the best time

00:11.379 --> 00:13.581
to start seeing somebody.

00:13.682 --> 00:16.015
You got family secrets?
You have no idea.

00:16.117 --> 00:18.185
Somebody's still out there
trying to kill us.

00:18.286 --> 00:20.187
Trying to set me up?
Catherine and I,

00:20.288 --> 00:21.689
we risked everything to help.

00:21.790 --> 00:23.557
You're supposed
to be protecting us!

00:23.658 --> 00:26.093
Someone made you into... this.

00:26.194 --> 00:27.695
Someone's always gonna want you
dead because of it.

00:27.796 --> 00:29.196
Sorry it had to be me.

00:30.632 --> 00:32.133
Vincent, don't!

00:34.169 --> 00:36.904
No...
That wasn't you. You know that.

00:37.005 --> 00:38.739
What are we gonna do?
We'll find a way.

00:38.840 --> 00:40.207
I'm never letting you go,

00:40.308 --> 00:42.343
so we gotta find a way,
all right?

00:44.312 --> 00:46.313
♪

00:53.889 --> 00:55.589
(door opens)

00:55.690 --> 00:57.091
Hey, babe.

00:57.192 --> 00:59.326
Vincent!

00:59.427 --> 01:00.761
I've been so worried.
Where have you been?

01:00.862 --> 01:02.329
Are you all right?
Yeah, sure.

01:02.430 --> 01:03.798
I'm fine.

01:03.899 --> 01:05.065
I'm fine. Why?

01:05.167 --> 01:06.233
Why? Are you kidding?

01:06.334 --> 01:08.269
DHS is everywhere
looking for you.

01:08.370 --> 01:10.271
You killed
the deputy secretary.

01:10.372 --> 01:11.906
Yeah, it was self-defense.

01:12.007 --> 01:14.175
I know it was self-defense,
and you know,

01:14.276 --> 01:16.744
but as far as DHS is concerned...
Vino?

01:16.845 --> 01:19.013
Okay, you need
to listen to me, Vincent.

01:19.114 --> 01:20.514
You have to get out of here.

01:20.615 --> 01:21.982
I'm not going anywhere.

01:22.083 --> 01:23.417
I'm innocent.

01:23.518 --> 01:24.145
To us.

01:24.169 --> 01:25.686
How are we going
to prove that?

01:25.687 --> 01:27.087
Hill made it look like...

01:27.189 --> 01:30.424
like you were a vet with PTSD,
bent on revenge.

01:30.525 --> 01:33.460
I am not giving up on everything
that we've worked so hard for,

01:33.562 --> 01:35.296
and I'm not giving up on us.
No way.

01:35.397 --> 01:36.797
No. You don't understand.
This is worse than anything

01:36.898 --> 01:38.178
we have ever been
through before.

01:38.266 --> 01:40.167
I don't know how
to make it right.

01:40.268 --> 01:41.769
We will make it right,
we always do.

01:41.870 --> 01:43.370
Here.

01:43.471 --> 01:44.711
No, this is different, Vincent.

01:44.739 --> 01:45.873
You need to get out of here.

01:45.974 --> 01:47.708
I'm not going anywhere, okay?

01:47.809 --> 01:49.276
I am certainly

01:49.377 --> 01:51.412
never leaving you.
Come here.

02:32.921 --> 02:35.155
CATHERINE: <i>I have no idea</i>
<i>where Vincent is.</i>

02:35.257 --> 02:37.524
I haven't seen
or heard from him since...

02:37.626 --> 02:38.993
Since he murdered
Secretary Hill?

02:39.094 --> 02:41.028
It was self-defense;
Hill set him up.

02:41.129 --> 02:42.663
Files say he was troubled. PTSD.

02:42.764 --> 02:44.331
That's why he went after
his ex-CO, too.

02:44.432 --> 02:45.499
That's not what happened.

02:45.600 --> 02:46.500
Then what did happen?

02:46.601 --> 02:48.202
I don't know.

02:48.303 --> 02:49.670
Come on, Agent Chandler.

02:49.771 --> 02:51.839
I've had a long train ride
up from D.C.

02:51.940 --> 02:53.707
and you've had a long
couple days, too, I'm sure.

02:53.808 --> 02:55.342
So can we just cut the crap?

02:55.443 --> 02:57.611
I'm here
to get answers

02:57.712 --> 02:59.713
and I expect
your full cooperation.

02:59.814 --> 03:01.181
What do you want me to say?

03:01.283 --> 03:02.917
How about the truth?

03:03.018 --> 03:05.085
Let's start there.

03:05.186 --> 03:07.288
Now, if you're claiming

03:07.389 --> 03:09.023
that Hill set your husband up,

03:09.124 --> 03:10.724
you have to have
a reason to think so.

03:10.825 --> 03:12.459
Unless, of course,
you're aiding and abetting,

03:12.560 --> 03:14.094
in which case I will have
to arrest you right here now--

03:14.195 --> 03:15.863
and believe me, I will.

03:17.299 --> 03:18.933
Obviously, Hill was keeping
secrets from me,

03:19.034 --> 03:21.302
otherwise Vincent wouldn't
be on the run

03:21.403 --> 03:23.237
and I wouldn't be here,

03:23.338 --> 03:24.738
worrying if he's
even still alive.

03:24.839 --> 03:26.874
We were trying to do
the right thing.

03:26.975 --> 03:28.175
We thought we were helping DHS

03:28.209 --> 03:29.376
figure out
who killed Agent Russo.

03:29.477 --> 03:31.779
We had no idea

03:31.880 --> 03:33.147
that Hill would turn on us.

03:33.248 --> 03:34.448
Why was Vincent even involved?

03:34.516 --> 03:35.636
He's a doctor, not an agent.

03:35.684 --> 03:37.418
He was Special Forces.

03:37.519 --> 03:38.919
Still, why enlist an ex-soldier,

03:39.020 --> 03:40.654
or why make an outsider
like you an agent

03:40.755 --> 03:42.289
when there are plenty of agents
around here already?

03:42.390 --> 03:45.159
Like I said, obviously,
Hill had his secrets.

03:45.260 --> 03:47.328
And you obviously have yours.

03:50.699 --> 03:53.667
This is a big deal,
Agent Chandler,

03:53.768 --> 03:55.669
and until I get
some answers,

03:55.770 --> 03:57.410
DHS is gonna want
to keep this thing quiet

03:57.505 --> 03:59.974
from the public,
so as to not create a panic,

04:00.075 --> 04:01.775
especially with all
the media circling.

04:01.876 --> 04:03.610
Which means
I'm under a lot of pressure

04:03.712 --> 04:05.412
to track your husband down,

04:05.513 --> 04:07.147
and fast, find out what's
really going on around here.

04:07.248 --> 04:09.483
Which also means

04:09.584 --> 04:13.587
you're either with us
or against us.

04:19.761 --> 04:21.528
(car horns honking)

04:23.198 --> 04:24.999
Please tell me you're not
looking for Vincent, JT.

04:25.100 --> 04:26.500
Of course I'm looking
for Vincent.

04:26.601 --> 04:28.561
I'm worried about him.
I have no idea where he is.

04:28.603 --> 04:30.137
All right, then at least tell me

04:30.238 --> 04:31.271
you didn't tap into
DHS surveillance monitors.

04:31.373 --> 04:32.806
Well, not exactly.

04:32.907 --> 04:34.174
I'm using Cat's authorization.

04:34.275 --> 04:36.276
Damn it, JT. Turn off your
computers right now.

04:36.378 --> 04:37.644
What? No. How else
am I going to find him?

04:37.746 --> 04:39.313
What if he's in trouble?

04:39.414 --> 04:42.016
He's already in trouble.
He killed a federal agent.

04:42.117 --> 04:43.550
Come on, you know...
I know that it was self-defense,

04:43.651 --> 04:44.985
but all that matters

04:45.086 --> 04:46.387
is that DHS thinks
that he murdered him

04:46.488 --> 04:47.568
and now they're pulling out

04:47.655 --> 04:48.889
all the stops to try
to catch him.

04:48.990 --> 04:50.958
How do you know?

04:51.059 --> 04:52.626
I know because
Cat just got hauled in

04:52.727 --> 04:54.395
to meet with a domestic
terrorism agent up from D.C.

04:54.496 --> 04:56.330
DHS is keeping the manhunt

04:56.431 --> 04:57.698
out of the public eye.

04:57.799 --> 04:58.966
NYPD doesn't even know.

04:59.067 --> 05:00.401
But isn't that a good thing?

05:00.502 --> 05:01.535
No, it's a bad thing.

05:01.636 --> 05:03.470
It means DHS can do anything

05:03.571 --> 05:05.072
and everything they want to...
to catch Vincent

05:05.173 --> 05:06.740
without having
to answer to anybody.

05:06.841 --> 05:08.475
It means they'll do
whatever it takes.

05:08.576 --> 05:10.544
Okay, all the more reason
to find Vincent first,

05:10.645 --> 05:12.146
make sure he's all right.

05:12.247 --> 05:13.847
No, you need to make sure
you're all right.

05:13.948 --> 05:15.549
They know that you're
connected to Vincent.

05:15.650 --> 05:17.251
If they find out that
you're covering for him, too...

05:17.352 --> 05:19.019
You're actually
worried about me.

05:20.588 --> 05:22.489
I'm worried about all of us...

05:22.590 --> 05:24.892
including Heather, who has not
gotten back to me, by the way.

05:24.993 --> 05:27.027
(knocking at door)

05:27.128 --> 05:29.063
AGENT: JT Forbes?
Homeland Security.

05:29.164 --> 05:30.297
Open up.

05:31.666 --> 05:34.001
What do I do? What do I do?

05:34.102 --> 05:35.202
Turn off your computers.

05:35.303 --> 05:36.837
Wipe your hard drives. Hurry!

05:36.938 --> 05:38.405
Okay. I'm hanging up.
No, no, no, JT, don't...

05:38.506 --> 05:40.808
(knocking continues)

05:46.047 --> 05:47.281
Can I help you?

05:47.382 --> 05:49.550
Professor Forbes?
Agent Duffy, DHS.

05:49.651 --> 05:51.218
We have a warrant

05:51.319 --> 05:52.753
to impound your computers.
What? Wait, wait.

05:52.854 --> 05:54.054
We'd also like you
to come downtown

05:54.155 --> 05:55.289
to answer
some questions

05:55.390 --> 05:57.157
regarding
Vincent Keller.

05:58.193 --> 06:00.060
You got a warrant for that, too?

06:00.161 --> 06:02.362
No, but I can get you
one if you like.

06:02.464 --> 06:05.065
♪

06:12.140 --> 06:13.373
(elevator bell dings)

06:14.709 --> 06:16.910
Easy with the equipment, okay?

06:17.011 --> 06:19.546
Everything better be working
when I get it back.

06:19.647 --> 06:21.615
DUFFY: Special Agent Morgan?
JT Forbes.

06:21.716 --> 06:24.151
Thank you, Kerry.

06:24.252 --> 06:25.986
I'm the agent who's in charge
of finding your friend.

06:26.087 --> 06:27.588
I'm hoping you could
help us out.

06:27.689 --> 06:30.324
Haven't seen him in days.

06:30.425 --> 06:33.327
Professor, why don't you
step in here, have a seat.

06:33.428 --> 06:34.962
I'll be right with you.

06:35.063 --> 06:36.230
(sighs)

06:36.331 --> 06:38.398
Coffee?

06:38.500 --> 06:40.567
No, thanks.

06:40.668 --> 06:44.438
Shouldn't you be chasing down
al-Qaeda or something?

06:46.407 --> 06:47.741
JT.

06:49.010 --> 06:50.010
Heather.

07:05.927 --> 07:08.829
(phone ringing)

07:08.930 --> 07:09.847
Hello.

07:09.871 --> 07:11.698
TESS: Cat, finally.
I've been calling everywhere.

07:11.699 --> 07:14.368
I can't find anybody.
Hi, Tess.

07:14.469 --> 07:15.508
You all right?
Is it safe to talk?

07:15.532 --> 07:16.603
For now, yeah.

07:16.604 --> 07:17.971
I just got back from DHS.
I don't think they've had

07:18.072 --> 07:19.840
a chance to bug my phones... yet.
All right,

07:19.941 --> 07:22.643
well, they got JT, Cat. And
Heather, too, for all I know.

07:22.744 --> 07:23.505
What? Why?

07:23.529 --> 07:25.279
They're talking to anybody
who knows Vincent.

07:25.280 --> 07:27.681
They want answers. This is
bad, Cat. It's really bad.

07:27.782 --> 07:29.616
Yeah. Believe me, I know.
You haven't

07:29.717 --> 07:30.338
heard from him?

07:30.362 --> 07:32.152
Nothing.
And that's what scares me.

07:32.153 --> 07:33.687
What if they've already got him
and they're not telling me?

07:33.788 --> 07:35.522
Or what if he just decided
to take off

07:35.623 --> 07:37.457
to protect me, to protect us?

07:37.559 --> 07:39.059
Cat, calm down.
Vincent would never leave you,

07:39.160 --> 07:40.627
you know that, no matter what.

07:40.728 --> 07:42.048
He'll never stop fighting
for you.

07:42.130 --> 07:44.031
Yeah,
and that's what scares me, too.

07:44.132 --> 07:46.567
That could get him caught.
It could get him killed.

07:46.668 --> 07:48.035
Cat...
Come on, Tess.

07:48.136 --> 07:50.571
DHS doesn't care
about taking him in alive.

07:50.672 --> 07:52.239
They just want to stop him,
and they're gonna do that

07:52.340 --> 07:54.508
any way they can.

07:54.609 --> 07:57.044
(sighs)
Sorry.

07:57.145 --> 07:59.546
No, you're right. They got to
solve this before it gets out.

07:59.647 --> 08:01.315
I mean, they haven't
even released any information

08:01.416 --> 08:02.816
on what happened to Hill yet.

08:02.917 --> 08:05.052
They're keeping everything
under wraps.

08:05.153 --> 08:06.620
So what am I gonna do?

08:06.645 --> 08:08.645
I don't know if there's anything
you can do.

08:08.756 --> 08:10.090
You know they're watching you--
they have to be.

08:10.191 --> 08:12.526
If I was you,
I would just lay low.

08:12.627 --> 08:13.560
Vincent's got to be working
on something.

08:13.661 --> 08:15.062
Wait for him to find you.

08:15.163 --> 08:16.683
Yeah, I'm better at doing
than waiting.

08:16.764 --> 08:18.365
Yeah, well,
you better get used to it.

08:18.466 --> 08:20.901
Unless you're just willing
to tell DHS the truth.

08:21.002 --> 08:23.604
What, that Hill was covering
for a beast

08:23.705 --> 08:25.906
and then he decided to try
and kill Vincent instead?

08:26.007 --> 08:28.342
I don't know. Maybe.
Give me a break.

08:28.443 --> 08:30.077
Oh, what, you got a better idea?
Than confiding

08:30.178 --> 08:32.078
in the Feds
and hoping that they understand

08:32.179 --> 08:33.380
about beasts?

08:33.481 --> 08:35.182
No, I don't think so.

08:35.283 --> 08:36.683
Been there, burned by that.

08:36.784 --> 08:38.183
All right.
So what are you gonna do?

08:38.219 --> 08:41.121
I guess just wai...
(screams)

08:41.222 --> 08:42.589
Cat?

08:42.690 --> 08:45.959
Cat? Hello?

08:47.695 --> 08:48.462
(screams)

08:48.563 --> 08:49.730
You okay?

08:49.831 --> 08:51.064
I think I'm gonna throw up.

08:51.165 --> 08:52.699
I'm sorry. Deep breaths,
deep breaths.

08:52.800 --> 08:55.302
All right,
breathe. Sorry.

08:55.403 --> 08:57.537
I just didn't know any other way
to see you without getting caught.

08:57.639 --> 09:00.674
Breathe, breathe.

09:02.076 --> 09:03.110
Better?

09:03.211 --> 09:04.077
A little.

09:04.178 --> 09:05.612
(exhales)

09:05.713 --> 09:07.481
I was so worried.

09:07.582 --> 09:08.949
I know. Me, too.

09:09.050 --> 09:11.418
What have you been doing?
Where have you been?

09:11.519 --> 09:12.653
I don't know.
Everywhere. Anywhere.

09:12.754 --> 09:14.655
Just constantly moving.

09:14.756 --> 09:16.123
I'm so sorry about this.

09:16.224 --> 09:17.758
Vincent, this isn't your fault.

09:17.859 --> 09:19.760
Yeah, well, unfortunately,

09:19.861 --> 09:22.896
the guys with drones and guns
don't know that, do they?

09:24.332 --> 09:25.932
What does DHS know?
Know?

09:26.034 --> 09:27.968
Nothing. Certainly not
the truth.

09:28.069 --> 09:29.469
According to them,
you're just a loose cannon

09:29.570 --> 09:31.405
that killed one of their own.
Great.

09:31.506 --> 09:34.574
Which means we got to prove
that Hill was trying to kill me first.

09:34.676 --> 09:36.943
Yeah, but how are we gonna do
that without revealing why?

09:37.045 --> 09:38.645
Well, they don't need to know
about beasts, right,

09:38.746 --> 09:40.747
to know it was
self-defense.

09:40.848 --> 09:42.582
Hill hired assassins.
They cost money, so there's got

09:42.684 --> 09:44.451
to be
a paper money trail somewhere.

09:44.552 --> 09:45.952
Even if there is,
we're never gonna find it.

09:46.054 --> 09:47.954
DHS, they confiscated
all of Hill's files,

09:48.056 --> 09:49.756
including the encrypted ones,

09:49.857 --> 09:51.925
which, by the way,
include beasts.

09:52.026 --> 09:54.461
Come on, Catherine, you got
to somehow get into Hill's computer.

09:54.562 --> 09:56.930
There's got to be evidence
in there to exonerate me.

09:57.031 --> 09:58.498
They're never gonna let me
near them.

09:58.599 --> 09:59.866
Catherine, you got to find
a way, okay? I can't

09:59.967 --> 10:01.835
keep dodging these drones
much longer,

10:01.936 --> 10:03.837
and we're not gonna get our
lives back until I'm vindicated.

10:03.938 --> 10:05.839
We're not gonna get our lives
back if we can't figure out

10:05.940 --> 10:08.175
who wants to capture a beast either.
Okay, I know a way

10:08.276 --> 10:09.810
to fix that, okay,
but you got to get back

10:09.911 --> 10:11.712
inside DHS to make it happen.

10:11.813 --> 10:13.847
They are never going
to trust me, Vincent.

10:13.948 --> 10:15.615
They will if you throw me
under the bus.

10:15.717 --> 10:16.717
What?

10:16.751 --> 10:18.051
Just hear me
out, okay?

10:18.152 --> 10:19.712
I had a lot of time
to think about this.

10:19.754 --> 10:21.521
You play into
their narrative.

10:21.622 --> 10:24.358
You say you didn't realize
how bad my PTSD had gotten.

10:24.459 --> 10:27.194
You say you didn't realize
how crazed I had become.

10:27.295 --> 10:28.628
I can't do that.

10:28.730 --> 10:30.697
Catherine, you
got to, okay?

10:30.798 --> 10:32.466
You got to say, you got
to do anything you can

10:32.567 --> 10:34.067
to get back inside
before they get me.

10:34.168 --> 10:37.471
Otherwise... otherwise,
we don't stand a chance.

10:38.940 --> 10:40.807
You're afraid,
too, aren't you?

10:40.908 --> 10:43.143
It's just, we deserve
better than this.

10:43.244 --> 10:44.644
We deserve to be together.

10:44.746 --> 10:47.914
We deserve to be back
on our damn honeymoon.

10:48.015 --> 10:49.850
We're gonna make
it happen, all right?

10:49.951 --> 10:52.352
I know.

10:52.453 --> 10:54.373
(helicopter whirring) You'd better go.
All right.

10:55.623 --> 10:56.890
I love you so much.

10:56.991 --> 10:58.725
I love you, too.

10:58.826 --> 11:00.494
(sighs)

11:05.631 --> 11:09.631

11:19.396 --> 11:21.455
Are you out of your damn mind?
CATHERINE: Maybe.

11:21.456 --> 11:23.857
We'll see. Vincent's convinced
this is the only way.

11:23.958 --> 11:25.258
Yeah, the only way
to get your ass busted.

11:25.360 --> 11:26.760
Cat, this is the Department of

11:26.861 --> 11:28.028
Homeland Security, okay?
You don't mess with them.

11:28.129 --> 11:29.730
They make people disappear.

11:29.831 --> 11:32.032
Being dramatic, aren't you?
Oh, am I?

11:32.133 --> 11:33.934
Hey, you ever wonder
why we haven't had

11:34.035 --> 11:35.802
another major terrorist attack
in over a decade?

11:35.903 --> 11:38.071
Hear what DHS does to keep that
from happening, or what they do

11:38.172 --> 11:39.539
to anybody who tries?

11:39.640 --> 11:41.375
Okay, but I am not a terrorist.

11:41.476 --> 11:42.909
I'm a fellow agent, at least
for now, and all I'm gonna do

11:43.011 --> 11:45.946
is pretend to cooperate
with Morgan's investigation.

11:46.047 --> 11:48.148
To try to gain access
to Hill's files.

11:48.249 --> 11:49.409
Yes, and hopefully to be able

11:49.484 --> 11:50.751
to warn Vincent
if DHS gets onto him.

11:50.852 --> 11:53.086
Cat, do you hear yourself?
You're talking

11:53.187 --> 11:56.590
about going undercover inside of
DHS while DHS is watching you.

11:56.691 --> 11:58.558
Yeah, I know, it's tricky.
Tricky?

11:58.659 --> 12:00.927
It's impossible. How long
do you think it's gonna take

12:01.029 --> 12:02.629
for them to figure it out,
and then where will you be?

12:02.730 --> 12:04.264
No worse off than I am now.

12:04.365 --> 12:05.732
You know what?
Prison's worse.

12:09.837 --> 12:12.406
Look, I'm not trying
to be Debbie Downer here, okay?

12:12.507 --> 12:15.275
I just, I got to tell you, Cat,
this-this is not a good plan.

12:15.376 --> 12:16.910
You got to think about yourself

12:17.011 --> 12:18.678
before it's too late.
Okay, so what are you saying?

12:18.780 --> 12:20.414
I should just give up?
Do nothing?

12:20.515 --> 12:22.482
Save myself
while they're hunting Vincent?

12:22.583 --> 12:23.983
No, that's not
what I'm saying. I...

12:24.018 --> 12:25.018
Then what are you saying?

12:25.119 --> 12:27.621
Look, I just can't help
but think

12:27.722 --> 12:29.356
that there's got
to be some other way.

12:29.457 --> 12:30.590
(sighs)

12:30.691 --> 12:32.192
Can you talk

12:32.293 --> 12:35.195
later in person, maybe after
you meet with Morgan?

12:35.296 --> 12:36.830
Yeah, but at the café

12:36.931 --> 12:38.691
in case you're right
and they're watching me.

12:38.733 --> 12:41.535
All right.
Are JT and Heather okay?

12:41.636 --> 12:43.537
Yeah, they're fine, and don't
worry. They didn't say anything.

12:43.638 --> 12:44.671
Well, they don't know anything.

12:44.772 --> 12:46.139
Well, they know
about beasts, so...

12:46.240 --> 12:48.275
But DHS doesn't.
Only Hill did.

12:48.376 --> 12:50.644
Another reason why we need
to get access to his files.

12:50.745 --> 12:52.145
I got to go.
Cat...

12:55.283 --> 12:57.751
(siren blaring, crowd chatter)

13:00.588 --> 13:02.556
Kyle!

13:02.657 --> 13:05.725
Male, 40s, pulse is 85, BP
141/92, nausea, abdominal pain.

13:05.827 --> 13:07.961
Got it. Trauma Two,
call Dr. Indaman, stat.

13:08.062 --> 13:10.330
Hey.

13:10.431 --> 13:12.271
I am so sorry about last night.
Where were you?

13:12.333 --> 13:13.274
Why didn't you call?

13:13.298 --> 13:15.878
I couldn't. I got hung up.
It's a long story.

13:15.879 --> 13:17.842
Yeah? Got anything
to do with Vincent?

13:17.866 --> 13:18.783
No.

13:18.807 --> 13:20.041
Come here.

13:21.497 --> 13:23.269
Heather, what's been going on?
Homeland Security's

13:23.270 --> 13:24.941
all over this place asking
questions about him.

13:24.942 --> 13:26.409
What do you mean?
What kind of questions?

13:26.509 --> 13:28.076
Like how well
do we know him?

13:28.177 --> 13:30.145
Has he done anything suspicious?
Do we know where he is?

13:30.246 --> 13:32.747
Oh, my God.
Talk to me, Heather.

13:32.849 --> 13:35.817
What's going on?
I don't know.

13:35.918 --> 13:39.855
Okay, fine. I do know.
I just... I can't tell you.

13:39.956 --> 13:44.025
More secrets? Are you in
some kind of trouble, too?

13:44.127 --> 13:45.927
I don't know.
I don't think so.

13:46.028 --> 13:47.596
What am I supposed to do?

13:48.208 --> 13:50.843
I can't help you
if you won't let me in.

13:50.944 --> 13:53.212
I know.

13:53.313 --> 13:54.613
(beeping)

13:54.714 --> 13:56.782
I got to go.

13:56.883 --> 13:59.852
No. Kyle.

14:05.191 --> 14:07.292
JT: <i>I need twin</i>
<i>extreme graphics cards</i>

14:07.394 --> 14:09.395
installed in each of them, too.

14:09.496 --> 14:10.896
No, it's not for gaming,

14:10.997 --> 14:13.198
and, yes, I need
all the power I can get.

14:13.299 --> 14:15.100
How soon could I pick up
the computers?

14:15.201 --> 14:17.703
(phone ringing)

14:26.680 --> 14:30.082
Uh, uh, fine. Great.
Uh, I'll be there.

14:30.183 --> 14:31.717
(phone beeps off)

14:31.818 --> 14:33.218
Hello.

14:33.319 --> 14:34.620
Hey, you alone?

14:34.721 --> 14:35.954
Vincent. Uh, what...

14:36.056 --> 14:38.123
what are you doing?
Are you all right?

14:38.224 --> 14:40.826
Yeah, for now, but I don't have
much time to talk, okay?

14:40.927 --> 14:42.928
When did you put
the burner phone in my pocket?

14:43.029 --> 14:45.731
Right after you left DHS,
before you hopped on the subway.

14:45.832 --> 14:47.752
Look, buddy, I stole
your wallet, too. I'm sorry.

14:47.834 --> 14:49.568
I need the cash, okay?
I'll pay you back.

14:49.569 --> 14:50.406
Damn.

14:50.430 --> 14:51.870
Okay, you think
they're watching you?

14:51.947 --> 14:53.165
I don't know. Maybe.

14:53.166 --> 14:56.371
DHS confiscated my computers,
but don't worry.

14:56.372 --> 14:58.573
They're not gonna find anything
about you on them.

14:58.674 --> 15:00.775
I just ordered new ones
so I can hack into theirs,

15:00.876 --> 15:02.076
keep you one step ahead of them.

15:02.177 --> 15:04.245
Forget that. Hopefully,

15:04.346 --> 15:06.681
Catherine will find
her own access to DHS computers.

15:06.782 --> 15:09.317
How?
Look, never mind.

15:09.418 --> 15:11.252
Buddy, I need you to get me
some medical supplies, okay?

15:11.353 --> 15:13.254
I'm gonna text you a list.

15:13.355 --> 15:15.323
Wait. Why? Are you hurt?

15:15.424 --> 15:16.991
No, but I'm about
to hurt somebody else.

15:17.092 --> 15:20.461
Who? What are you talking about?

15:20.563 --> 15:21.996
While Catherine works
on exonerating me,

15:22.097 --> 15:23.765
I'm gonna try and find out
who's behind

15:23.866 --> 15:25.500
this damn beast bounty
once and for all.

15:25.601 --> 15:27.101
How are you gonna do that?
Well,

15:27.202 --> 15:29.470
$5 million bounty's
been out there a long time.

15:29.572 --> 15:31.105
So, I just put the word out

15:31.206 --> 15:34.042
that I might know
who everybody's looking for.

15:34.143 --> 15:36.144
You're baiting a bounty hunter?

15:36.245 --> 15:38.313
Yeah. What better way
to find out

15:38.414 --> 15:41.316
who's behind the reward, huh?

15:41.417 --> 15:43.117
Hey, hold on a minute.

15:44.286 --> 15:47.121
You're Kane?
Yeah.

15:47.222 --> 15:48.790
(grunts)

15:48.891 --> 15:51.359
Look, just get me the supplies,
all right?

15:51.460 --> 15:53.294
And meet me
at Catherine's office.

15:53.395 --> 15:55.296
I'll explain later.

15:55.397 --> 15:56.965
Cat's office?
How are you even gonna get

15:57.066 --> 15:58.299
near that place
without being seen?

15:58.400 --> 15:59.667
Look, that's the last place

15:59.768 --> 16:01.536
DHS is gonna be looking for me,
all right?

16:01.637 --> 16:02.904
No one's gonna see me.

16:03.005 --> 16:05.940
Be there, 1:00 sharp.

16:08.410 --> 16:10.411
Okay.

16:15.684 --> 16:18.019
(knocking)
What?

16:18.120 --> 16:19.420
Can I come in?

16:19.521 --> 16:22.423
Call you back.

16:22.524 --> 16:23.691
Agent Chandler.

16:23.792 --> 16:25.159
Please, sit.

16:25.260 --> 16:27.161
Thank you.

16:27.262 --> 16:29.263
(clears throat)

16:30.332 --> 16:32.667
Um...

16:32.768 --> 16:35.136
my husband doesn't trust you.

16:36.505 --> 16:40.208
The government... for...
for many reasons.

16:40.309 --> 16:42.677
He won't...

16:42.778 --> 16:44.712
he won't be taken alive,
Agent Morgan.

16:44.813 --> 16:47.949
He will do anything
to prove his innocence.

16:48.050 --> 16:50.852
And you still think he's
innocent, that Hill set him up?

16:50.953 --> 16:53.855
I think that he is troubled.

16:53.956 --> 16:57.525
More so
than I let myself believe.

16:58.827 --> 17:01.129
I love my husband, Agent Morgan,

17:01.230 --> 17:05.465
but I know that he needs help,
I know that now.

17:05.567 --> 17:07.902
He shouldn't have run,
he should have trusted me.

17:08.002 --> 17:09.404
In what way?

17:09.505 --> 17:11.105
I would've told him

17:11.205 --> 17:13.473
to trust
that the truth would come out,

17:13.575 --> 17:15.108
but now he just looks guilty.

17:15.210 --> 17:18.212
Look, I know Vincent,

17:18.313 --> 17:22.316
and he will not give up
without a fight.

17:24.153 --> 17:26.554
That's why I came back.

17:28.724 --> 17:31.092
I don't want to be a widow.

17:33.562 --> 17:34.996
Okay.

17:35.097 --> 17:37.432
What do you want to do?

17:37.533 --> 17:40.401
I want to find proof

17:40.502 --> 17:42.637
that Secretary Hill
really did set him up.

17:42.738 --> 17:44.338
I know that's not
what you think

17:44.440 --> 17:46.240
happened, but Vincent does.

17:46.341 --> 17:49.310
And if he at least thinks that
you're trying to find proof,

17:49.411 --> 17:53.181
then maybe he will trust you
enough to let you bring him in.

17:54.516 --> 17:56.284
Alive.

18:06.695 --> 18:08.663
Agent Chandler's
willing to cooperate,

18:08.764 --> 18:10.465
wants access to Hill's files.

18:10.566 --> 18:11.999
Sorry?
Yeah, I know.

18:12.101 --> 18:14.335
Let's play this thing out,
see where she ends up.

18:14.436 --> 18:17.205
If she's right and he's innocent,
let her try and prove it.

18:17.306 --> 18:19.440
And if she's playing us
to keep us off his trail?

18:19.541 --> 18:21.375
Then she'll tip her hand and
give us something we can use,

18:21.477 --> 18:23.878
whether she wants to or not.

18:23.979 --> 18:26.314
And then I'll bust 'em both.

18:26.415 --> 18:27.849
Either way, she's gonna be
leading us to Keller, right?

18:27.950 --> 18:29.383
Get her the files.

18:34.223 --> 18:36.891
Okay, I'm in.

18:36.992 --> 18:38.292
What do you want me to do next?

18:38.393 --> 18:40.194
All right, sit down.

18:40.295 --> 18:42.897
Sit down?

18:42.998 --> 18:46.567
Yeah, sit down
and hold onto the bag. Tight.

18:50.606 --> 18:54.275
Now what?

18:58.080 --> 19:01.149
(JT yells, chair squeaks)

19:09.636 --> 19:13.139
No wonder facial recognition
didn't get any hits on you.

19:13.240 --> 19:15.007
Yeah, it's temporary.

19:15.108 --> 19:17.143
You need me to get
you any supplies?

19:17.244 --> 19:18.845
Food, blankets,
camp stove?

19:18.946 --> 19:20.313
I said it's temporary, okay?

19:20.414 --> 19:22.415
Okay.

19:22.516 --> 19:24.517
I get it. I mean,
frankly, I'm surprised

19:24.618 --> 19:26.586
you haven't beasted out,
like, 15 times by now.

19:26.687 --> 19:29.155
Yeah, well, I lived like this
once, I'm not gonna do it again.

19:29.256 --> 19:30.656
I want my life back.

19:30.757 --> 19:32.091
If you can even get it back.

19:32.192 --> 19:34.560
Come on, you got to admit,

19:34.661 --> 19:36.529
no matter how
you look at it, it's bad.

19:36.630 --> 19:38.264
Yeah, okay, I know
it's bad, all right?

19:38.365 --> 19:41.500
But I'm gonna get my life
back, so give me the bag.

19:54.281 --> 19:56.015
(zipping)

19:56.116 --> 19:56.916
(Vincent sighs)

19:57.017 --> 19:58.584
What are you doing?

19:58.685 --> 20:01.420
What is that?
Just a little something

20:01.521 --> 20:03.022
to get you to talk.

20:03.123 --> 20:04.690
If this doesn't work,

20:04.791 --> 20:06.893
I'll try something stronger.

20:06.994 --> 20:09.195
I told you, I'm not
telling you who sent me.

20:09.296 --> 20:10.763
Well, we'll see
about that.

20:10.864 --> 20:12.098
What'd you do to him?

20:12.199 --> 20:14.467
Obviously, not enough
to get answers.

20:14.568 --> 20:17.870
Did he attack you?
What difference does it make?

20:17.971 --> 20:19.438
It makes a huge difference.
You can't go around

20:19.539 --> 20:20.940
kidnapping people
and beating the crap

20:21.041 --> 20:22.475
out of them.
That's not right.

20:22.576 --> 20:25.111
Right, so, framing me
or setting me up for murder is?

20:25.212 --> 20:26.812
He didn't set you up for murder.

20:26.914 --> 20:28.547
He's a bounty hunter, not DHS.

20:28.649 --> 20:30.616
Oh, same difference
from where I stand.

20:30.717 --> 20:34.320
That'd better kill me, or I
swear to God, I'll kill you.

20:34.421 --> 20:35.955
Vincent, listen to me.

20:36.056 --> 20:37.490
I know you're upset. You
have every right to be.

20:37.591 --> 20:39.225
But you're crossing
the line here.

20:39.326 --> 20:42.228
Look, JT, I don't want to bring
you back into this, okay?

20:42.329 --> 20:44.230
So, if you want to go,
you go. I understand.

20:44.331 --> 20:47.233
Otherwise, back off.

20:47.334 --> 20:49.435
This is the only way.

20:49.536 --> 20:53.205
(loud, prolonged groaning)

20:55.509 --> 20:57.310
(whimpers, panting)

20:57.411 --> 20:59.779
(panting)

21:05.185 --> 21:07.486
Hey.
Hey.

21:07.587 --> 21:10.189
So, how'd it go
with Morgan?

21:10.290 --> 21:13.025
I think he bought
the whole worried wife bit.

21:13.126 --> 21:15.027
At least he acted like it.

21:15.128 --> 21:16.662
He gave me access
to Hill's files.

21:16.763 --> 21:18.698
Really? And?
Some are

21:18.799 --> 21:21.133
heavily encrypted.
I'm assuming those are the ones

21:21.234 --> 21:24.136
that JT concealed about
what Hill knew about beasts.

21:24.237 --> 21:25.705
Still, stay away from those,
'cause you know, DHS,

21:25.806 --> 21:27.506
they're shadowing
every keystroke.

21:27.607 --> 21:29.508
That's why I need your help
to figure out what I found

21:29.609 --> 21:30.810
in Hill's personal file.

21:30.911 --> 21:33.479
I took a screenshot.
I sent it to you.

21:33.580 --> 21:35.314
Don't worry. Once you open it,
it'll erase.

21:35.415 --> 21:37.049
DHS will never be able
to trace it.

21:37.150 --> 21:37.950
What is it?

21:38.051 --> 21:38.951
Wire transfers.

21:39.052 --> 21:40.152
In large amounts.

21:40.253 --> 21:41.487
I need you
to figure out

21:41.588 --> 21:43.712
who Hill
was wiring that money to.

21:43.713 --> 21:46.005
Well, like maybe it was to the
hit men he sent after Vincent?

21:46.029 --> 21:47.393
Hopefully.

21:47.394 --> 21:49.962
And if that's the case, maybe
I can prove to Agent Morgan

21:50.063 --> 21:52.198
that it really was self-defense.

21:52.299 --> 21:54.667
And if it's not
enough? Well, look,

21:54.768 --> 21:57.837
you know how much I love you
and Vincent, right?

21:57.938 --> 21:59.905
Uh-oh...
Uh-oh's right.

22:00.007 --> 22:01.841
You're not gonna like what I'm
gonna say, but I'm gonna say it

22:01.942 --> 22:04.310
anyway, 'cause I would not be
a friend if I didn't.

22:04.411 --> 22:06.312
I'm just suggesting
that you think

22:06.413 --> 22:08.714
long and hard about what's
really going on here, Cat,

22:08.815 --> 22:12.551
and, maybe more importantly,
for how long it's been going on.

22:12.652 --> 22:15.554
Four years you've been fighting
this fight, Cat, or at least

22:15.655 --> 22:18.724
some version of it.
Covering up from the police,

22:18.825 --> 22:21.327
the Feds, uh, press,
family, friends, me.

22:21.428 --> 22:24.230
Someone, somehow
is always after Vincent,

22:24.331 --> 22:26.399
and now he's not only running
from beast bounty hunters

22:26.500 --> 22:27.666
but he's
also running

22:27.768 --> 22:28.901
from Homeland Security,

22:29.002 --> 22:30.202
and you're enabling him.

22:30.303 --> 22:31.570
Enabling?

22:31.671 --> 22:33.572
Cat, you're
breaking the law again.

22:33.673 --> 22:35.574
For the greater good, maybe,
and for Vincent, absolutely,

22:35.675 --> 22:37.610
but you're still breaking
the law.

22:37.711 --> 22:41.547
And the worst of it is that
it's just... it's never-ending.

22:41.648 --> 22:44.750
So sooner or later, you just
have to say, where is the line?

22:44.851 --> 22:47.486
How long can you justify
all this?

22:48.955 --> 22:52.191
I can't give up on Vincent.
I won't.

22:52.292 --> 22:53.759
Yeah, but maybe there's
another way.

22:53.860 --> 22:55.594
Maybe it is time
to break the chain,

22:55.695 --> 22:57.930
because this one is sure as hell
not working.

22:58.031 --> 22:59.565
Okay. Then what's the other way?

22:59.666 --> 23:00.699
Bring Vincent in.

23:00.801 --> 23:02.201
He's innocent.

23:02.302 --> 23:04.403
Trust the system
to prove it.

23:04.504 --> 23:06.705
Trust why you became a cop
in the first place.

23:06.807 --> 23:12.411
And at least it might
save Vincent's life.

23:15.715 --> 23:18.284
I stole a car when I was
in high school.

23:18.385 --> 23:21.387
Robbed a liquor store,

23:21.488 --> 23:24.723
jewelry store,
bank.

23:24.825 --> 23:27.093
Wait, was the bank
before the jewelry store?

23:28.395 --> 23:30.262
You heard him.

23:30.363 --> 23:32.264
Got what I need.
Graydal Securities is the one

23:32.365 --> 23:34.266
behind the beast bounty,

23:34.367 --> 23:36.435
so that's where I'm going next.

23:36.536 --> 23:38.270
No. Bank after.

23:38.371 --> 23:40.806
Never got caught either.
It was a beautiful thing.

23:40.907 --> 23:42.641
Wait, Graydal's

23:42.742 --> 23:44.477
not just your everyday
security firm.

23:44.578 --> 23:47.246
They're like Blackwater
on steroids.

23:47.347 --> 23:49.615
They take down dictators.
They're not gonna just let you

23:49.716 --> 23:53.152
walk in there and tell you who
hired them to capture a beast.

23:53.253 --> 23:55.087
I know. I'll have
to earn their trust first.

23:55.188 --> 23:56.388
How do you plan on doing that?

23:56.456 --> 23:58.023
I got a great reference
right there.

23:59.526 --> 24:00.426
Reference?

24:00.527 --> 24:01.994
Wait,
you-you mean

24:02.095 --> 24:04.530
to get a job? At Graydal?

24:04.631 --> 24:06.198
Yeah. I got to get
on the inside, right?

24:06.299 --> 24:08.334
Just like Catherine is with DHS.

24:08.435 --> 24:10.503
Which makes you both masochists.
Vincent, please, (phone buzzes)

24:10.604 --> 24:12.505
this has gotten way out
of control.

24:12.606 --> 24:14.206
We need
to just think this through.

24:14.307 --> 24:15.608
It's Catherine, man.
I got to go.

24:15.709 --> 24:16.842
Stay here

24:16.943 --> 24:18.110
and watch him, okay?

24:18.211 --> 24:19.311
But...
I'll be back for him.

24:19.412 --> 24:20.846
Wait...
If he moves,

24:20.947 --> 24:22.181
use the tranq gun.
Wait!

24:22.282 --> 24:23.983
I slept
with my brother's wife, too.

24:24.084 --> 24:25.084
Twice.

24:26.453 --> 24:27.853
And her sister.

24:27.954 --> 24:29.722
Both sisters,
actually.

24:29.823 --> 24:31.157
(laughs)

24:31.258 --> 24:34.326
Great. Just... great.

24:37.464 --> 24:39.832
(insects trilling)

24:45.505 --> 24:47.740
(gasps, exhales)
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

24:47.841 --> 24:49.081
I really should
stop doing that.

24:49.176 --> 24:50.509
Is my heart still beating?

24:50.610 --> 24:52.278
It's fine.
I'm a doctor, remember?

24:53.346 --> 24:55.514
Well, at least I used to be.

24:55.615 --> 24:58.317
And you will be again,
once we get you reinstated.

24:58.418 --> 25:00.719
I thought you might be hungry.
I'm starving.

25:00.820 --> 25:02.221
Does this mean you got proof?

25:02.322 --> 25:03.722
Not proof
but hopefully

25:03.823 --> 25:05.191
a lead.

25:05.292 --> 25:06.659
Tess helped me figure out

25:06.760 --> 25:08.561
that Hill wired two
separate installments

25:08.662 --> 25:11.230
to this private security
company named, uh...

25:11.331 --> 25:13.165
Graydal?
Yeah. How'd you know that?

25:13.266 --> 25:14.700
I didn't, but I just found out
that Graydal are the ones

25:14.801 --> 25:16.368
behind the bounty hunters, too.
Wait,

25:16.469 --> 25:18.771
so they're behind the bounty
hunters and the hit men?

25:18.872 --> 25:20.773
Graydal's a full-service
company, all right?

25:20.874 --> 25:22.841
They'll do anything
and everything for cash.

25:22.943 --> 25:25.749
Obviously, Hill hired them for
assassins. They provided them.

25:25.750 --> 25:28.418
Now another client
is asking for bounty hunters.

25:28.519 --> 25:29.465
I just got to find out who.

25:29.489 --> 25:31.355
It's more than we had before.
I can bring it to Agent Morgan.

25:31.356 --> 25:33.590
Maybe he can open an
investigation on Graydal.

25:33.691 --> 25:36.860
No. Look, Graydal is not
gonna say why Hill hired them.

25:36.961 --> 25:39.361
They're certainly not gonna say
that they provided assassins.

25:39.397 --> 25:41.798
Still, it's more than we had before.
It's a legitimate lead.

25:41.899 --> 25:46.370
Vincent, maybe we should... stop
trying to do this on our own.

25:46.471 --> 25:49.039
Maybe, maybe we should
do this the right way.

25:49.140 --> 25:50.674
The right way, huh?

25:50.775 --> 25:53.143
Why don't I just
turn myself in?

25:53.244 --> 25:54.544
Well, that is an option.

25:54.646 --> 25:55.479
No, it's not.

25:55.580 --> 25:57.180
It is not an option.

25:57.281 --> 25:59.950
Catherine,
even if we trusted Morgan,

26:00.051 --> 26:02.319
Graydal is not into due process.

26:02.420 --> 26:04.154
Okay, as soon as they find out
DHS is investigating,

26:04.255 --> 26:06.156
they'll circle the wagons,
and then we'll get no evidence

26:06.257 --> 26:08.225
on Hill
or whoever's behind the bounty.

26:08.326 --> 26:09.960
Okay,
but what's the alternative?

26:10.061 --> 26:11.461
Right now we don't have
any proof, and it's only

26:11.562 --> 26:13.463
a matter of time
before DHS catches you.

26:13.564 --> 26:16.190
But if I can get into Graydal,
I can get evidence.

26:16.215 --> 26:17.634
I can get proof. I know it.

26:17.635 --> 26:19.970
You want to hand yourself
over to the people who are hunting you?

26:20.071 --> 26:22.739
They got no idea I'm the beast
they're looking for. They don't.

26:22.840 --> 26:25.008
The only reason they know me is
because I'm Hill's target, okay?

26:25.109 --> 26:27.010
Now that Hill's gone, they
have no contract with Graydal.

26:27.111 --> 26:29.012
But if they find out
that you are the beast,

26:29.113 --> 26:30.580
they could kill you.

26:30.682 --> 26:32.315
That is a risk
I'm willing to take.

26:32.417 --> 26:33.884
But I'm not.

26:33.985 --> 26:36.153
Vincent, we keep
getting in deeper.

26:36.254 --> 26:38.889
It keeps getting riskier.
When are we gonna realize

26:38.990 --> 26:42.192
that we can't do this on our
own? When does this ever end?

26:42.293 --> 26:43.960
It will end.

26:45.096 --> 26:47.197
We will end this, okay?

26:48.299 --> 26:50.934
I will end this. I promise.

27:10.555 --> 27:12.723
I'm here to see his boss.

27:16.561 --> 27:17.627
(groans)

27:40.804 --> 27:44.073
Pretty ballsy move,
you walking in here that way.

27:44.174 --> 27:45.708
Problem is,
you just put

27:45.809 --> 27:47.443
one of my best men
on the bench,

27:47.544 --> 27:49.579
and that's gonna
cost me money.

27:49.680 --> 27:50.947
That's not my problem.

27:51.048 --> 27:53.583
It will be
if you don't tell me why.

27:55.085 --> 27:57.286
Who are you? What do you want?

27:57.388 --> 27:58.921
I think you know who I am.

27:59.022 --> 28:01.124
Secretary Hill hired you,
uh, twice

28:01.225 --> 28:04.060
to take me out,
if I remember correctly.

28:04.161 --> 28:06.229
I don't know
what you're talking about.

28:06.330 --> 28:08.731
Sure you do. It's your business
to know things.

28:08.832 --> 28:10.600
Including
the fact

28:10.701 --> 28:14.337
that Hill is now a dead man.

28:14.438 --> 28:17.340
Thanks to you. Vincent Keller.

28:17.441 --> 28:18.975
Right.

28:19.076 --> 28:20.977
So now you're
here for what?

28:21.078 --> 28:23.746
Justice? Revenge?

28:23.847 --> 28:26.516
Oh, no, sir.
I got my revenge on Hill.

28:26.617 --> 28:29.786
I'm just here to make sure
that since he's no longer around

28:29.887 --> 28:33.256
to pay you,
I'm no longer a target.

28:33.357 --> 28:35.258
Not to us, maybe.

28:35.359 --> 28:38.628
But to DHS, you're
still a target.

28:38.729 --> 28:40.196
Like you said,

28:40.297 --> 28:41.464
my business to know things.

28:41.565 --> 28:44.534
But what I don't know

28:44.635 --> 28:48.805
is why Hill was interested
in you in the first place.

28:48.906 --> 28:50.706
Did you have something on him?

28:50.808 --> 28:53.142
Or did he have
something on you?

28:53.243 --> 28:56.879
Well, that doesn't
matter much now, does it?

28:56.980 --> 28:59.549
Maybe not.

28:59.650 --> 29:02.385
So why are you here?

29:02.486 --> 29:04.487
Well, I can't
keep running.

29:04.588 --> 29:06.722
DHS is gonna find
me sooner or later.

29:06.824 --> 29:10.726
So right now, I
need a place to stay.

29:10.828 --> 29:13.329
(laughs)

29:13.430 --> 29:15.998
And you think what,

29:16.099 --> 29:18.668
that I'm running a
shelter here for fugitives?

29:18.769 --> 29:20.903
This is a business.
Yeah,

29:21.004 --> 29:24.574
and I can be an asset.
I will earn my keep.

29:26.076 --> 29:27.310
If Kane is one of your best,

29:27.411 --> 29:28.878
just imagine what I can do.

29:28.979 --> 29:32.548
I know you checked out
my credentials.

29:32.649 --> 29:35.818
Special Forces,
a checkered past,

29:35.919 --> 29:38.221
and now thoroughly disillusioned
with the very government

29:38.322 --> 29:40.389
that turned you into
a killing machine.

29:40.491 --> 29:42.725
You have the right skill
set for us, Keller.

29:42.826 --> 29:44.360
So what's the problem?

29:44.461 --> 29:45.928
I don't trust you.

29:46.029 --> 29:48.130
That's the problem.

29:49.933 --> 29:53.503
More specifically...

29:53.604 --> 29:56.172
I don't trust your wife.

29:56.273 --> 29:57.063
Why?

29:57.087 --> 29:59.186
Because, for all I know,
you're working for her,

29:59.776 --> 30:02.912
for DHS, trying to dig up dirt
on Graydal.

30:03.013 --> 30:04.514
I can't risk that.

30:06.116 --> 30:07.950
Sorry.

30:08.051 --> 30:10.219
(door opens)

30:10.320 --> 30:12.221
(door shuts)

30:24.535 --> 30:26.435
(knocking)
CATHERINE: Come in.

30:26.537 --> 30:30.106
HEATHER: Hey. We came as fast as we
could. Is everything all right?

30:30.207 --> 30:33.209
Stupid question but...
Okay, whatever.

30:33.310 --> 30:34.810
I'm sorry I keep bringing
you guys into this.

30:34.912 --> 30:37.079
I know it's not just affecting
me or Vincent.

30:37.180 --> 30:38.232
Yeah.

30:38.256 --> 30:40.082
We're here for you, Cat. That's
all you have to worry about.

30:40.083 --> 30:41.284
Thank you.

30:41.385 --> 30:42.618
Um...

30:42.719 --> 30:46.222
so I saw Vincent last night.

30:46.323 --> 30:47.256
HEATHER:
<i>Holy crap. Really?</i>

30:47.357 --> 30:49.425
How is he? Is he okay?

30:49.526 --> 30:51.427
CATHERINE: Let's just say
that he is more determined

30:51.528 --> 30:53.758
than ever to prove
that he is innocent.

30:53.782 --> 30:55.097
On his own.

30:55.098 --> 30:56.879
Yeah.
So where does that leave you?

30:56.900 --> 30:59.302
I don't know.
That's why

30:59.403 --> 31:01.137
I wanted to talk to you guys.

31:01.238 --> 31:04.173
(sighs)
I love him.

31:04.274 --> 31:05.341
Of course you do.

31:05.442 --> 31:07.910
But I am afraid for him, too.

31:08.011 --> 31:10.313
He won't listen
to me anymore.

31:10.414 --> 31:11.514
He won't let me help him.

31:11.615 --> 31:13.249
Help him how?
Help him by...

31:13.350 --> 31:14.984
doing the right thing,
doing what you said--

31:15.085 --> 31:17.286
trusting Morgan,
trusting the law.

31:17.387 --> 31:18.454
Wait, what?

31:19.523 --> 31:20.590
Cat, are you crazy?

31:20.691 --> 31:22.191
You really want to turn him in?
No,

31:22.292 --> 31:23.459
I don't want to turn him in,

31:23.560 --> 31:25.661
but what other choice do I have?

31:25.762 --> 31:27.562
Like I said, this isn't
just about us anymore.

31:27.598 --> 31:28.931
It's about you guys.

31:29.032 --> 31:30.800
Do you want to keep
lying to Kyle?

31:30.901 --> 31:32.268
Well, no, but...

31:32.369 --> 31:34.604
I don't want to betray him,

31:34.705 --> 31:35.838
but...

31:35.939 --> 31:37.340
if something happened
to Vincent

31:37.441 --> 31:39.375
and I could've done something
to save him...

31:39.476 --> 31:41.978
I couldn't live with myself.

31:43.447 --> 31:45.281
TESS:
<i>So, what are you gonna do?</i>

31:45.382 --> 31:46.415
CATHERINE:
I don't know.

31:48.051 --> 31:49.685
But I have to think
of something

31:49.786 --> 31:51.487
'cause I can't keep doing this.

31:51.588 --> 31:52.989
Get Morgan.

31:53.090 --> 31:55.491
Tell him we might
have something.

32:05.144 --> 32:07.212
(sighs)
Thank you.

32:09.353 --> 32:11.555
Big change of heart.

32:11.656 --> 32:13.623
Interesting choice
of words.

32:14.826 --> 32:16.760
Never mind.
No, I understand.

32:16.861 --> 32:18.895
He's your husband,
you love him.

32:18.996 --> 32:20.096
But he's done a terrible thing.

32:20.198 --> 32:21.398
It was self-defense.

32:21.499 --> 32:23.266
Got any proof yet?
No.

32:23.367 --> 32:25.327
But I'm afraid that Vincent's
going to get himself

32:25.369 --> 32:26.803
into even more trouble

32:26.904 --> 32:29.406
unless I do something fast.

32:29.507 --> 32:30.740
I'm afraid that

32:30.842 --> 32:32.609
he's gonna cross a line

32:32.710 --> 32:34.911
that he can never
come back from.

32:38.483 --> 32:40.717
So, you really think
you can bring him in?

32:41.986 --> 32:44.287
Yeah, I'm the only one who can.

32:44.388 --> 32:45.956
Because he trusts me.

32:46.057 --> 32:47.924
And you're prepared
to make that choice.

32:48.025 --> 32:52.395
I think that it is
the only way to save him,

32:52.497 --> 32:54.664
and that's all I care about.

32:57.201 --> 32:59.436
Promise me you won't hurt him.

32:59.537 --> 33:01.404
As long as he surrenders
peacefully.

33:01.506 --> 33:03.139
And...

33:03.241 --> 33:05.742
as long as this isn't a trick.

33:09.413 --> 33:11.515
(sighs)

33:11.616 --> 33:13.683
(phone beeps)

33:15.186 --> 33:16.853
Vincent?

33:16.954 --> 33:18.388
Vincent,
we have to meet.

33:19.624 --> 33:22.392
It's important.

33:33.037 --> 33:35.438
(bird cawing)

33:36.541 --> 33:37.774
Catherine?

33:39.043 --> 33:40.810
Hey.

33:40.912 --> 33:43.713
Come here.

33:46.384 --> 33:48.018
You okay?

33:48.119 --> 33:50.820
(heart beating rapidly)

33:52.823 --> 33:54.357
What's the matter?

33:54.458 --> 33:55.992
Your heart's going, like,
a million miles an hour.

33:56.093 --> 33:57.727
I know.

33:57.828 --> 34:00.063
I'm worried about you.

34:00.164 --> 34:01.531
I'm fine.

34:01.632 --> 34:05.235
No, you're not, Vincent,
we're not.

34:05.336 --> 34:06.870
What do you mean?

34:06.971 --> 34:10.674
I mean, all of this has...
has gotten so out of control,

34:10.775 --> 34:13.342
I-I can't see any other way.

34:13.444 --> 34:15.579
(heart beating rapidly)
Wait, what's going on?

34:16.746 --> 34:19.149
I want you to turn yourself in.

34:19.250 --> 34:20.650
What?

34:20.751 --> 34:23.253
Just listen to me,
Vincent, I am begging you.

34:23.353 --> 34:25.322
I can't-I can't
keep turning my back

34:25.422 --> 34:27.190
on the law anymore
and neither can you.

34:27.291 --> 34:30.327
Uh-uh, no,
we've had this conversation.

34:30.428 --> 34:31.695
Yes, but now we have a lead.

34:31.795 --> 34:34.364
And Agent Morgan, he has
promised to follow up on it,

34:34.465 --> 34:36.065
to help you prove
that you're innocent,

34:36.167 --> 34:39.268
but you-you've gotta
turn yourself in first.

34:39.370 --> 34:42.038
You made a deal with him,
didn't you?

34:42.139 --> 34:44.440
He knows that you're here
right now?

34:44.542 --> 34:46.842
Okay, you have to believe me,

34:46.944 --> 34:48.378
you have to trust me.

34:48.478 --> 34:50.179
This is, this is the only way.

34:50.281 --> 34:51.547
(branch snaps)

34:51.649 --> 34:54.016
(rustling)

35:02.660 --> 35:04.294
No.

35:04.395 --> 35:06.396
Move, move, move, move!
Come on!

35:08.199 --> 35:09.599
(men shouting)

35:09.700 --> 35:11.968
I don't believe this.

35:14.372 --> 35:15.872
I don't believe that you would
do this to me.

35:15.973 --> 35:17.733
I don't believe that
you would do this to us!

35:26.584 --> 35:27.751

if something went wrong?

35:59.932 --> 36:01.566
Are you kidding, JT?
Everything's already gone wrong.

36:01.668 --> 36:03.335
Look at the situation we're in.

36:03.436 --> 36:05.404
(quietly):
Right.

36:05.505 --> 36:07.205
You're really worried
about Vincent, huh?

36:07.306 --> 36:08.607
Hell, yeah, I am.

36:08.708 --> 36:12.177
I haven't seen him
like this since...

36:12.278 --> 36:15.213
a time I never wanted
to see again.

36:17.216 --> 36:18.717
Well, brace yourself,

36:18.818 --> 36:19.951
'cause one way or the other,

36:20.053 --> 36:21.286
we're about to find out
what went down.

36:21.387 --> 36:22.787
Sorry, took longer
with Agent Morgan

36:22.855 --> 36:24.189
than I thought it would.

36:24.290 --> 36:25.924
All right, did he buy your act?

36:26.025 --> 36:27.826
Does he believe
you betrayed Vincent?

36:29.195 --> 36:30.762
Well, he took
surveillance off me,

36:30.863 --> 36:32.197
so that's a good sign.

36:32.298 --> 36:34.966
And I'm still an agent,
I still have access.

36:35.068 --> 36:37.402
Question is,
did Vincent buy the plan?

36:38.671 --> 36:40.105
I don't know.

36:40.206 --> 36:41.273
I knew they
were listening.

36:41.374 --> 36:44.209
I could only get to Tess
and Heather,

36:44.310 --> 36:46.111
so we could make DHS think

36:46.212 --> 36:48.513
that I was actually considering
turning Vincent in.

36:50.149 --> 36:51.669
So you never let Vincent
in on the plan

36:51.751 --> 36:53.051
before it went down?

36:53.152 --> 36:55.087
I couldn't.

36:55.188 --> 36:58.323
They were watching me
the entire time.

36:58.424 --> 37:01.593
I just have to trust
that he could sense it.

37:01.694 --> 37:02.828
But you're not sure.

37:02.929 --> 37:04.830
No.

37:05.765 --> 37:08.567
(sighs)
What a mess.

37:08.668 --> 37:10.135
Maybe you were right, Tess.

37:10.236 --> 37:12.270
Maybe we should've just
turned him in for real.

37:13.339 --> 37:15.807
You couldn't do it,
I get it.

37:15.908 --> 37:17.676
Epic love must suck.

37:17.777 --> 37:20.645
But there's no turning
back now, Cat.

37:20.747 --> 37:22.614
I really hope you made
the right choice

37:22.715 --> 37:24.355
'cause, I'm sorry,
but I-I can't help you.

Decide to come clean, finally?

37:57.250 --> 37:58.650
Hey, hey.

37:58.751 --> 38:01.186
What's the matter?
(sniffles)

38:01.287 --> 38:03.288
You mean, what
isn't the matter?

38:03.389 --> 38:06.024
I'm sorry, it's just...

38:06.125 --> 38:07.659
it's been a really long week,

38:07.760 --> 38:11.029
and it kind of feels like
everything's falling apart.

38:11.130 --> 38:12.130
Vincent?

38:13.933 --> 38:15.901
You don't have to lie
to me, Heather.

38:16.002 --> 38:18.837
I meant what
I said before.

38:18.938 --> 38:20.071
I want to be there for you,
but I can't

38:20.173 --> 38:22.073
unless you stop keeping secrets
from me.

38:22.175 --> 38:23.241
I want to tell you.

38:23.342 --> 38:24.409
Then, why don't you?

38:28.981 --> 38:31.249
No, wait.

38:34.253 --> 38:37.489
Vincent's working undercover...
for Homeland Security.

38:37.590 --> 38:40.425
That's... that's why they were
here interviewing everybody,

38:40.526 --> 38:42.661
to see if anybody knows,

38:42.762 --> 38:44.429
because they can't
know, no one can.

38:44.530 --> 38:46.832
Why?

38:46.933 --> 38:48.400
Why Vincent?

38:48.501 --> 38:49.668
I don't know.

38:49.769 --> 38:51.870
I don't even
think Cat does.

38:51.971 --> 38:53.605
Look, all I know is
that if anybody knows

38:53.706 --> 38:55.707
what he's really doing, it
could be really dangerous.

38:55.808 --> 38:57.742
So you have to promise me,

38:57.844 --> 39:01.613
you have to keep the secret,
too, okay?

39:01.714 --> 39:03.114
Okay.

39:03.216 --> 39:04.616
Okay.

39:44.056 --> 39:45.891
You scared me again.

39:45.992 --> 39:48.493
Well, there's nothing wrong
with your heart, at least.

39:48.594 --> 39:51.129
So you're not mad at me?

39:51.230 --> 39:53.832
Not unless you really are
trying to bring me in.

39:53.933 --> 39:55.734
You're not, are you?

39:55.835 --> 39:57.969
Because otherwise I misread
your heart back there,

39:58.070 --> 40:00.238
and that-that would be a first.

40:00.339 --> 40:02.140
You did not misread it.

40:02.241 --> 40:03.308
But you weren't sure?

40:03.409 --> 40:05.477
Yeah, I'm not sure
about anything anymore.

40:05.578 --> 40:07.412
Look, it was the
right thing to do.

40:07.513 --> 40:09.147
It was our only choice.

40:09.248 --> 40:10.949
No, it wasn't our
only choice, Vincent,

40:11.050 --> 40:14.185
but you wouldn't trust anybody
else to fix this but us,

40:14.287 --> 40:16.922
and I couldn't keep Agent Morgan

40:17.023 --> 40:19.257
questioning my loyalties
anymore.

40:21.694 --> 40:24.095

40:24.196 --> 40:27.499
Two months ago,
we were on our honeymoon.

40:27.600 --> 40:29.301
Come on.

40:29.402 --> 40:32.037
It's just... temporary.

40:32.138 --> 40:33.338
Is it?

40:33.439 --> 40:35.173
Are you sure?

40:35.274 --> 40:38.977
'Cause I'm not.

40:39.078 --> 40:41.346
This is how we met, Vincent,

40:41.447 --> 40:44.716
only now it's worse
because we're both in hiding.

40:44.817 --> 40:46.184
What are you in hiding for?

40:46.285 --> 40:47.552
I thought you said Agent Morgan
believed you?

40:47.653 --> 40:48.787
Yeah, he thinks that
I threw you under the bus

40:48.888 --> 40:50.322
just like you suggested.

40:50.423 --> 40:52.524
Well, that's good, right?
DHS, they trust you.

40:52.625 --> 40:54.125
And now, when
Graydal finds out

40:54.226 --> 40:57.963
that you betrayed me, then
they'll trust me, too.

40:58.064 --> 41:00.131
Come on, it's fine,
we're both in.

41:00.232 --> 41:02.167
Yeah, on opposite sides
of the law.

41:02.268 --> 41:03.802
It's not gonna be
for long, okay?

41:03.903 --> 41:05.704
Well, it can't, because...

41:05.805 --> 41:08.139
this is too risky.

41:08.240 --> 41:10.508
It's going to blow up
in our faces

41:10.609 --> 41:13.078
if we're not careful
and if you keep trying

41:13.179 --> 41:14.579
to bull your way
through this on your own.

41:14.680 --> 41:16.648
You can't do that, okay?

41:16.749 --> 41:18.550
Okay.

41:18.651 --> 41:20.151
We may be forced apart,

41:20.252 --> 41:22.554
but we have to figure out
how to do this together.

41:22.655 --> 41:24.723
And we have
to figure this out

41:24.824 --> 41:27.058
fast because...

41:27.159 --> 41:30.829
we can't keep living like this.
