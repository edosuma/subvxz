00:20.820 --> 00:23.015
(reporters clamoring)

00:30.560 --> 00:32.551
(camera shutters
snapping rapidly)

00:46.840 --> 00:48.728
Good morning.

00:48.780 --> 00:53.410
An hour ago, I resigned as
State's Attorney of Cook County.

00:53.450 --> 00:55.247
I did this with a heavy heart

00:55.280 --> 00:58.215
and a deep commitment to fight
these scurrilous charges.

00:58.250 --> 01:00.252
I want to be clear.

01:00.290 --> 01:02.429
I have never abused my office.

01:02.460 --> 01:05.258
I have never traded lighter
sentences for financial

01:05.290 --> 01:06.848
or sexual favors.

01:06.900 --> 01:11.428
At the same time, I need to
atone for my personal failings

01:11.470 --> 01:13.791
with my wife, Alicia,
and our two children.

01:13.840 --> 01:16.729
The money used in these
transactions was mine...

01:16.770 --> 01:20.536
and mine alone.

01:20.580 --> 01:24.277
No public funds
were ever utilized.

01:24.310 --> 01:28.371
But I do admit to a failure of
judgment in my private dealings

01:28.420 --> 01:29.284
with these women.

01:32.460 --> 01:34.348
Alicia and I...

01:34.390 --> 01:38.281
ask that the press
please respect our privacy.

01:38.330 --> 01:41.356
Give us time to heal.

01:41.400 --> 01:44.426
With the love of God, and
the forgiveness of my family,

01:44.470 --> 01:47.234
I know I can
rebuild their trust.

01:47.270 --> 01:49.500
I want to thank
the people of Chicago.

01:49.540 --> 01:51.758
It has been an
honor to serve you.

01:51.810 --> 01:53.835
And I pray that one day,

01:53.880 --> 01:57.509
I may serve you
again. Thank you.

01:57.550 --> 01:59.609
REPORTER:
Sir! Are you still involved
with prostitutes, sir?

01:59.650 --> 02:01.447
How many were there, sir?

02:01.480 --> 02:04.415
WOMAN:
Will you ever try
to hold public office again?

02:04.450 --> 02:05.382
(reporters clamoring)

02:05.420 --> 02:08.309
Sir! Answer the question!

02:08.360 --> 02:10.385
We have interviews set up with
the Tribu and Channel Four.

02:10.430 --> 02:11.180
Absolutely not. I'm not doing
any more interviews.

02:11.230 --> 02:12.527
I want you to cancel
all of them.

02:12.560 --> 02:14.289
That's it.
I'll tell Channel Two

02:14.330 --> 02:15.888
we don't have a comment
at the present tIme,

02:15.930 --> 02:17.761
but we emphatically question
the authenticity of this thing.

02:25.340 --> 02:26.637
Hey.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.238
You all right?

02:40.590 --> 02:42.558
(reporters clamoring)

02:42.590 --> 02:44.478
WOMAN:
Mrs. Florrick,
how long have you known

02:44.530 --> 02:45.622
your husband
was having an affair?

02:45.660 --> 02:48.322
MAN: _
How are you gomg
to protect your children?

02:48.360 --> 02:51.363
(reporters clamoring,
camera shutters snapping)

03:17.390 --> 03:19.358
Oh, excuse me! Isn't
the staff meeting at 9:30?

03:19.400 --> 03:22.221
You're in the wrong conference
room. It's up one floor.

03:22.270 --> 03:23.419
Oh.

03:23.470 --> 03:25.563
God...

03:33.740 --> 03:36.470
. . MAN: .
This IS a maJor class action.

03:36.510 --> 03:38.671
A case that could propel us
to the top rank

03:38.710 --> 03:41.611
of full service firms, and I
don't think I need to remind you

03:41.650 --> 03:43.413
what that will do
to your year-end bonuses.

03:43.450 --> 03:46.419
Aanay, Sheffrin-Marks
fired their last ﬁrm

03:46.460 --> 03:47.654
because they took
their eye off the ball.

03:47.690 --> 03:49.385
So, until further notice,

03:49.430 --> 03:51.523
your personal lives
have been cancelled.

03:51.560 --> 03:53.323
WOMAN:
So, we'll need some of you

03:53.360 --> 03:55.590
to help out with
the lower profile client work

03:55.630 --> 03:57.564
to free up our top litigators.

03:57.600 --> 03:59.932
Ed, you take the witness prep
on highway redistribution.

03:59.970 --> 04:01.437
Don, you take
the Brighton criminal.

04:01.470 --> 04:02.607
And Alicia will take
the pro bono.

04:02.640 --> 04:04.437
(under breath):
Huh?

04:04.470 --> 04:05.835
Everyone else, your task
is to show Sheffrin-Marks

04:05.870 --> 04:08.475
our "A" game, okay?

04:08.510 --> 04:09.602
Let's do this.

04:16.050 --> 04:17.642
Will.

04:17.690 --> 04:18.679
Alicia.

04:18.720 --> 04:20.415
Hey.

04:20.460 --> 04:21.757
I'm sorry I didn't
introduce you in there.

04:21.790 --> 04:24.486
Everything's moving real fast
with this class action.

04:24.530 --> 04:26.418
Well, I just wanted to say
thank you for the opportunity.

04:26.460 --> 04:27.597
It's a real life saver.

04:27.630 --> 04:28.949
No, glad you
could come aboard.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.059
Hope you're all right
with this pro bono.

04:31.100 --> 04:32.499
How'd it sound?

04:32.540 --> 04:34.531
Interesting.
Good.

04:34.570 --> 04:37.505
Don't be nervous. You worried
about the gunshot reSIdue?

04:37.540 --> 04:38.734
The, um... Oh, God.

04:38.770 --> 04:39.907
(The Twilight Zone ringtone
Playing)

04:39.940 --> 04:40.975
Nice ringtone.
Who gets that?

04:41.010 --> 04:44.070
Oh, my mother-in-law.
My daughter programmed it.

04:44.110 --> 04:45.304
And what's yours?

04:45.350 --> 04:46.977
I don't want to know.

04:47.020 --> 04:48.874
So, um, the gun residue...

04:48.920 --> 04:50.945
Diane, you're
briefing Alicia, right?

04:50.990 --> 04:52.048
Good. You're in good hands.

04:52.090 --> 04:53.580
So, let's catch up,
have dinner.

04:53.620 --> 04:56.350
So, Will speaks highly of you.

04:56.390 --> 04:59.496
He says you graduated top
of your class at Georgetown.

04:59.530 --> 05:00.690
When was this?

05:00.730 --> 05:02.766
15 years ago.
Uh-huh?

05:02.800 --> 05:04.461
And you spent
two years at...

05:04.500 --> 05:05.626
Crozier, Abrams & Abbott.

05:05.670 --> 05:06.932
Good firm.

05:06.970 --> 05:08.335
Will says you
clocked the highest

05:08.370 --> 05:10.600
billable hours there.
Why did you leave?

05:10.640 --> 05:13.768
Well, the kids
and Peter's career.

05:13.810 --> 05:14.834
Hmm.

05:15.780 --> 05:18.749
Brian! Can you get
Mrs. Florrick the files?

05:18.780 --> 05:21.044
Mm-hmm. Sure.

05:21.080 --> 05:22.718
I want you to think of me

05:22.750 --> 05:24.479
as a mentor, Alicia.

05:24.520 --> 05:25.384
It's the closest
thing we have

05:25.420 --> 05:27.081
to an old boys'
network in this town.

05:27.120 --> 05:28.109
Women helping women, okay?

05:28.160 --> 05:29.718
Okay.

05:29.760 --> 05:32.354
When I was starting out,
I got one great piece of advice.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.391
Men can be lazy.
Women can't.

05:34.430 --> 05:36.125
And I think that
goes double for you.

05:36.160 --> 05:37.491
Not only are you

05:37.530 --> 05:38.827
coming back to the
workplace fairly late,

05:38.870 --> 05:41.395
but you have some
very prominent baggage.

05:41.440 --> 05:43.931
But, hey, if she can do it,
so can you.

05:43.970 --> 05:44.902
Thanks, Brian.

05:44.940 --> 05:47.829
Like many law firms,
we donate five percent

05:47.880 --> 05:49.905
of billable hours to pro bono.

05:49.950 --> 05:52.839
Sadly, I'm long past
my quota on this one.

05:52.880 --> 05:55.474
Jennifer Lewis.
26 years old.

05:55.520 --> 05:59.115
Taught second grade.

05:59.150 --> 06:01.459
Accused of killing
her ex-husband.

06:01.490 --> 06:03.879
Prosecution thought
it was a slam dunk 45 years,

06:03.930 --> 06:06.421
but the jury came back
last week deadlocked.

06:06.460 --> 06:08.724
Six jurors voted to convict,
six not.

06:08.760 --> 06:10.489
I'm not even sure
why the State Attorney

06:10.530 --> 06:12.669
is re-trying except
he wants... Justice!

06:12.700 --> 06:14.065
(whimpers)

06:14.100 --> 06:15.988
He wants to prove himself.
So, stick with my strategy

06:16.040 --> 06:18.600
from the first trial.
The police focused

06:18.640 --> 06:21.131
on Jennifer so early
in the investigation,

06:21.180 --> 06:22.738
they never even looked
for the carjacker.

06:22.780 --> 06:24.042
Deadlock a jury
a second time,

06:24.080 --> 06:26.674
they'll never
re-try a third. Okay?

06:26.720 --> 06:28.540
Okay. Our investigator
can get you up to speed

06:28.580 --> 06:29.740
for the bail
hearing at 3:00.

06:29.790 --> 06:30.848
Cormac, I'm ready.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.448
The hearing's today?

06:32.490 --> 06:33.718
Well, we could delay,
but that would leave

06:33.760 --> 06:35.057
Jennifer incarcerated
for another month.

06:35.960 --> 06:37.154
Don't worry.
You'll be fine.

06:37.190 --> 06:39.897
The ASA's not going to argue
against a recognizance release.

06:39.930 --> 06:42.922
Let's go.
Meeting's at 10:30.

06:48.070 --> 06:51.665
PETER:
But I do admit to a failure
of judgment

06:51.710 --> 06:53.701
in my private dealings
with these women...

06:53.740 --> 06:55.628
Sorry.

06:55.680 --> 06:58.205
...mine and mine alone.

06:58.250 --> 07:00.571
No public funds
were ever utilized.

07:00.620 --> 07:01.746
The recent news...

07:01.780 --> 07:04.180
(audio stops)

07:04.220 --> 07:05.585
Oh, hey. Let me
help you with that.

07:05.620 --> 07:06.757
No, I'm fine.

07:06.790 --> 07:08.018
No, no, I'm heading
that way aanay.

07:08.060 --> 07:09.209
I'm Cary, the other
new associate.

07:09.260 --> 07:10.818
Oh, right. Alicia.

07:10.860 --> 07:12.851
Yeah, look, I know we should
be at each other's throats,

07:12.900 --> 07:14.993
but I just want to say I really
respect what you're doing here.

07:15.030 --> 07:17.794
Raising a family and then
jumping right back into this.

07:17.830 --> 07:19.934
My mom, she's thinking
of doing the same thing.

07:19.970 --> 07:21.995
Great.
Yeah.

07:22.040 --> 07:23.166
So, you're on the
pro bono, right?

07:23.210 --> 07:24.234
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, that's great.

07:24.270 --> 07:25.464
I interned last summer
at the Innocence PrOJect.

07:25.510 --> 07:28.809
My dad's best friend is Barry
Scheck and it was just amazing.

07:28.840 --> 07:30.569
Helping people. Here, they
got me on the Sheffrin-Marks.

07:30.610 --> 07:31.599
I'm sure_ it will be
challenging, but at

07:31.650 --> 07:34.471
the end of the day,
what have you really done?

07:34.520 --> 07:36.169
Saved a corporation a
few billion dollars?

07:36.220 --> 07:37.244
You want to trade?

07:37.290 --> 07:40.782
I would, but I guess they
have other plans, so...

07:40.820 --> 07:43.050
I am almost done, Cary.
The latte's on your desk.

07:43.090 --> 07:44.751
Thank you.
Hi, Mrs. Florrick.

07:46.630 --> 07:47.858
Looks like_we
share an a55|stant,

07:47.900 --> 07:49.925
so tell me when
I'm hogging her, okay?

07:49.970 --> 07:51.528
And let the best man win.

07:51.570 --> 07:52.639
Excuse me?

07:52.670 --> 07:54.035
Uh, let the...

07:54.070 --> 07:55.560
Nothing.

07:55.600 --> 07:56.862
It's nothing. I...

07:56.910 --> 07:58.764
It's nothing.

08:01.580 --> 08:03.275
Oops.

08:03.310 --> 08:05.141
Don't worry.
It's yours.

08:05.180 --> 08:06.204
Oh.

08:06.250 --> 08:09.048
Kalinda Sharma.
I'm the in-house.

08:09.080 --> 08:10.183
Oh, the investigator.

08:10.220 --> 08:11.619
You're Peter Florrick's wife.

08:11.650 --> 08:12.719
That's right.

08:12.760 --> 08:14.216
I worked with him at
the State's Attorney's office

08:14.260 --> 08:15.215
three years.

08:15.260 --> 08:18.252
He fired me.

08:18.290 --> 08:19.848
Okay.

08:22.570 --> 08:24.925
The client is a second-
grade school teacher.

08:24.970 --> 08:27.029
Jennifer...
LeWIs.

08:27.070 --> 08:29.538
She was arrested for killing
her ex-husband.

08:29.570 --> 08:31.003
Making it look like
a botched carjacking.

08:31.040 --> 08:32.576
Gunshot residue

08:32.610 --> 08:34.874
was found on Jennifer's
face and hands.

08:34.910 --> 08:36.878
That's why the cops started
to think it was a murder

08:36.910 --> 08:38.571
disguised as a carjacking.

08:38.610 --> 08:41.010
According to them,
Jennifer shot her ex-husband

08:41.050 --> 08:42.779
and wiped down the gun.
And the motive?

08:42.820 --> 08:45.311
He remarried and wanted
custody of the three-year-old.

08:45.350 --> 08:47.614
Witnesses saw them arguing
a week before the murder.

08:47.660 --> 08:49.855
GRACE (on ringtone):
Hey, Mom. Pick up the phone.
Hey, Mom. Pick up the phone.

08:49.890 --> 08:52.029
Hey, Mom. Pick up...
Sorry. That's my daughter.

08:52.060 --> 08:53.197
Hi, Grace.

08:53.230 --> 08:54.128
Hey, Mom. I want
to ask you a question,

08:54.160 --> 08:56.219
but I don't want you
to freak out, okay?

08:56.260 --> 08:57.261
Uh-oh.

08:57.300 --> 08:58.597
Forget it. I'll ask Zach.

08:58.630 --> 09:00.291
No, no, no. What?
All right, well,

09:00.340 --> 09:03.002
some girl said Dad slept with
a hooker my age. And I just...

09:03.040 --> 09:04.302
What?
Ma'am, you'll have
to turn that off.

09:04.340 --> 09:06.103
They were playing the tape
in the computer lab.

09:06.140 --> 09:07.573
And some girl said

09:07.610 --> 09:09.578
her dad's a cop and he said
one of the hookers

09:09.610 --> 09:10.702
was a teenager.

09:10.750 --> 09:13.014
Okay, first of all, they were
all over 20 and second,

09:13.050 --> 09:14.642
where's the teacher?

09:14.680 --> 09:16.238
It's no big deal, Mom.
Look, I've got homework.

09:16.280 --> 09:17.747
I'll talk to you later.

09:17.790 --> 09:19.610
(sighs)

09:24.690 --> 09:25.554
What?

09:25.590 --> 09:29.356
Last time I was in court
was 13 years ago.

09:29.400 --> 09:31.595
Wow. I was 12.

09:33.170 --> 09:35.695
Thanks.

09:41.640 --> 09:43.346
MAN:
The judge reaches
into his pocket,

09:43.380 --> 09:46.008
pulls out a check,
handing it to the plaintiff.

09:46.050 --> 09:48.769
"I'm returning five grand
and we're going to decide this."

09:48.820 --> 09:51.584
(chuckling)

09:56.390 --> 09:58.585
That's Florrick's wife.

10:01.730 --> 10:03.664
Alicia?
My God.

10:03.700 --> 10:05.964
Matan, remember? From the
department Christmas party.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.262
You're at Stern,
Lockhart & Gardner?

10:07.300 --> 10:08.733
Yeah. First day.

10:08.770 --> 10:09.907
Wow. Oh.

10:09.940 --> 10:12.932
This is Sandra Pai.
She's new.

10:12.980 --> 10:13.901
Since Peter.

10:15.210 --> 10:16.177
How's he doing, by the way?

10:16.210 --> 10:17.643
Peter? Fine.

10:17.680 --> 10:18.874
Say hello for me, will you?

10:18.910 --> 10:21.413
Look at all this.

10:21.450 --> 10:22.644
You're going to bury us.

10:22.690 --> 10:24.180
I don't know
how you do it, Alicia.

10:24.220 --> 10:25.710
I'd be huddled up
in a ball somewhere.

10:25.750 --> 10:28.810
(electrical buzzing)

10:28.860 --> 10:30.782
Well, back to work.

10:30.830 --> 10:33.298
Good luck.

10:34.730 --> 10:36.027
Where's Diane?

10:36.060 --> 10:38.927
Diane asked me to
step in for her.

10:38.970 --> 10:41.837
Jennifer, I'm Alicia Florrick.

10:41.870 --> 10:43.838
I'm one of the other
lawyers with the firm.

10:43.870 --> 10:45.667
Step in? For how long?

10:45.710 --> 10:47.769
For the retrial.

10:47.810 --> 10:49.129
Oh, my God.
BAILIFF: All rise.

10:49.180 --> 10:50.306
Ma'am.

10:50.350 --> 10:51.772
The Criminal Court

10:51.810 --> 10:52.811
of Cook County
is now in session,

10:52.850 --> 10:54.875
the Honorable Judge
Richard Cuesta presiding.

10:54.920 --> 10:56.683
(gavelbangs)
Be seated.

10:56.720 --> 10:59.143
Okay, let's hear it.

11:01.420 --> 11:02.728
Your Honor, I just...

11:02.760 --> 11:04.785
Your Honor, just to
refresh your memory,

11:04.830 --> 11:05.785
the accused was
deemed a flight risk

11:05.830 --> 11:07.923
due to an earlier
custody hearing

11:07.960 --> 11:09.769
when she threatened
to run off with her daughter.

11:09.800 --> 11:12.689
And yet just last week
a jury deadlocked

11:12.740 --> 11:14.093
on these murder charges
six to six, Mr. Brody.

11:14.140 --> 11:15.437
Now I know our new
state's attorney

11:15.470 --> 11:17.961
wants to look tough,
but why are you fighting this?

11:18.010 --> 11:19.705
Your Honor,
I just wanted to...

11:19.740 --> 11:20.809
BRODY:
The people are
prepared to re-try

11:20.840 --> 11:22.102
this case right now, Your Honor.

11:22.140 --> 11:23.038
If Mrs. Florrick

11:23.080 --> 11:24.843
is so intent on
getting her client out,

11:24.880 --> 11:27.019
why doesn't she agree
to a speedy trial?

11:27.050 --> 11:28.847
CUESTA:
Mrs. Florrick?

11:28.880 --> 11:30.438
Yes, Your Honor.

11:30.490 --> 11:33.118
The wife of the esteemed
Peter Florrick?

11:33.160 --> 11:35.481
Your husband and I never quite
saw eye to eye, ma'am.

11:35.520 --> 11:36.919
Your Honor...

11:36.960 --> 11:38.052
Mrs. Florrick, don't talk.

11:38.090 --> 11:40.251
But if the prosecution thinks
that this will in some way

11:40.300 --> 11:41.392
prejudice me
against your client,

11:41.430 --> 11:43.091
he is sorely mistaken.

11:43.130 --> 11:45.462
Nice try, Matan.

11:45.500 --> 11:46.762
So Ms. Lewis is granted

11:46.800 --> 11:48.062
pretrial release

11:48.100 --> 11:49.806
with electronic monitoring.

11:49.840 --> 11:51.000
She is restricted
to temporary housrng,

11:51.040 --> 11:54.271
attorney's offices,
and transit in between.

11:54.310 --> 11:55.868
And given that this
is a rerun,

11:55.910 --> 11:58.344
I'll set the trial date
for the 25th.

11:58.380 --> 12:00.712
Now, are we all happy? Good.

12:05.120 --> 12:06.439
Thank you.

12:06.490 --> 12:07.957
Sure.

12:14.530 --> 12:18.728
Captioning sponsored by
CBS TELEVISION

12:28.540 --> 12:30.144
JENNIFER:
We had a nice time.

12:30.180 --> 12:32.273
Michael talked about
missing his daughter,

12:32.310 --> 12:36.269
the life we had together.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.185
We were driving home

12:38.220 --> 12:39.881
and,uh".

12:41.860 --> 12:43.122
...we got a flat.

12:44.360 --> 12:46.954
He was getting out to fix it,

12:47.000 --> 12:54.532
and I saw...

12:54.570 --> 12:56.390
a red pickup truck.

12:56.440 --> 12:57.930
(truck door opens)

12:59.910 --> 13:02.879
A man came up to Michael.
(gun cocking)

13:02.910 --> 13:04.571
I didn't see the gun

13:04.610 --> 13:05.577
until...

13:05.610 --> 13:07.441
(yelling):
Michael!

13:07.480 --> 13:08.572
Michael!

13:08.620 --> 13:11.544
And I saw Michael's face.

13:11.590 --> 13:15.014
It was, um...

13:17.360 --> 13:19.453
Do you need to take a break?

13:19.490 --> 13:21.219
Uh, no.

13:21.260 --> 13:22.591
Just-- if there was some water.

13:22.630 --> 13:23.995
ALICIA:
Sure.

13:25.970 --> 13:27.835
Sonia, we need
some water in here.

13:27.870 --> 13:29.189
It's going to be
about five minutes,

13:29.240 --> 13:31.162
but then I've got to do
his depo upstairs.

13:33.510 --> 13:35.831
Okay, uh,
tell me when you're done.

13:35.880 --> 13:39.179
You say this man ran to
a red pickup truck here,

13:39.210 --> 13:41.940
and took off in this direction
across the parking lot.

13:41.980 --> 13:44.289
There's a surveillance
camera here.

13:44.320 --> 13:47.153
And the prosecution played it
to make you look like a liar.

13:47.190 --> 13:48.612
I'm not lying.

13:48.660 --> 13:50.548
But there's no truck
on the tape.

13:50.590 --> 13:52.478
And that's why
you're facing a retrial now

13:52.530 --> 13:54.851
and not an acquittal.

13:54.900 --> 13:58.063
I think what Kalinda is
trying to say, Jennifer...

14:00.640 --> 14:03.609
...is-is it possible
that you were mistaken

14:03.640 --> 14:07.201
and that the car went this way--
not that way?

14:12.110 --> 14:14.044
Is that your daughter?

14:14.080 --> 14:17.243
They won't let me see her.

14:17.290 --> 14:20.885
Michael's parents have custody.

14:20.920 --> 14:22.922
What am I going to do?

14:22.960 --> 14:25.281
You're going to take it
one day at a time.

14:25.330 --> 14:26.627
We got you housing.

14:26.660 --> 14:28.059
You're going
to go there,

14:28.100 --> 14:29.897
take a shower, take a nap.

14:29.930 --> 14:30.624
Don't turn on the TV.

14:30.670 --> 14:31.625
You like reading?

14:31.670 --> 14:34.639
I'm going to get you some books.
Fiction is best.

14:34.670 --> 14:36.035
You won't feel like it,

14:36.070 --> 14:38.129
but put on nice
clothes and makeup.

14:38.170 --> 14:39.637
Force yourself to.

14:39.670 --> 14:41.228
Not for court--

14:41.280 --> 14:43.248
for you.

14:43.280 --> 14:47.114
It's the superficial things
that matter most right now.

14:47.150 --> 14:49.141
Does it ever get easier?

14:49.180 --> 14:50.989
No.

14:52.450 --> 14:55.954
But you do get better at it.

15:03.700 --> 15:05.190
What?

15:05.230 --> 15:08.688
If you identify with
too many clients, you burn out.

15:08.740 --> 15:13.006
Why don't you tell me when
I do something right, okay?

15:13.040 --> 15:14.507
Sure.

15:14.540 --> 15:16.201
You go and interview
the jurors

15:16.240 --> 15:17.969
and I'll try to figure out how

15:18.010 --> 15:19.546
a surveillance
camera can lie.

15:21.280 --> 15:22.941
That's right.
I was the jury foreman.

15:22.990 --> 15:24.309
And you don't mind answering
a few questions for us, Doctor?

15:24.350 --> 15:26.147
It'll help us refine
the case for the retrial.

15:26.190 --> 15:27.555
No problem.

15:27.590 --> 15:29.182
I don't think you'll
need much refining.

15:29.220 --> 15:31.279
Your case was very
strong, very logical.

15:31.330 --> 15:34.049
In fact, I'm not even sure why
the other side went to trial.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.658
I voted for conviction
right from the start.

15:35.700 --> 15:37.099
Good.

15:37.130 --> 15:38.529
You-you mean, acquittal.

15:38.570 --> 15:39.969
No, conviction.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.695
But I'm with the defense.

15:41.740 --> 15:43.367
Oh.

15:45.010 --> 15:47.171
MAN: She was lying about
the pickup truck.

15:47.210 --> 15:50.008
She had the gunshot
residue on her hands.

15:50.050 --> 15:52.371
Can I ask you how many
voted for conviction

15:52.410 --> 15:53.411
from the start, sir?

15:53.450 --> 15:55.077
Eleven.
What?

15:55.120 --> 15:56.985
There was only
one holdout.

15:57.020 --> 15:59.147
Juror number nine.

15:59.190 --> 16:01.385
We argued with her
for three days.

16:01.420 --> 16:03.559
But the judge
polled the jury

16:03.590 --> 16:05.353
and they deadlocked
six to six.

16:05.390 --> 16:07.995
Yes, well, the judge would
only declare us deadlocked

16:08.030 --> 16:09.054
if we were evenly split.

16:09.100 --> 16:11.159
So some of us agreed
to change our vote

16:11.200 --> 16:13.634
to not guilty just
to get out of there.

16:13.670 --> 16:16.059
If it hadn't been_
for juror number nine

16:16.100 --> 16:17.567
we would have convicted.

16:17.610 --> 16:21.398
She didn't convince us.
She exhausted us.

16:23.210 --> 16:24.609
(teakettle whistling)

16:24.650 --> 16:27.744
No tea for me, Mrs. Duretsky.

16:27.780 --> 16:29.111
Suit yourself.

16:29.150 --> 16:29.969
So the other jurors

16:30.020 --> 16:31.749
said you were a holdout.
Is that correct?

16:31.790 --> 16:32.814
Mm-hmm.

16:32.850 --> 16:36.058
They all thought they were
so much smarter than me.

16:36.090 --> 16:38.752
My vote counted
just as much as theirs.
Uh-huh.

16:38.790 --> 16:40.690
(mumbling)

16:40.730 --> 16:44.097
What exactly in the defense's
case convinced you?

16:44.130 --> 16:45.529
Well, the whole thing, really.

16:45.570 --> 16:48.368
I tend to look at a person
and size them up pretty quickly.

16:48.400 --> 16:51.369
That lady,
I liked her.

16:51.410 --> 16:53.037
The defendant, Jennifer?

16:53.080 --> 16:54.069
No, that lavwer lady.

16:54.110 --> 16:55.099
She never put on airs.

16:55.140 --> 16:56.129
I like that.

16:56.180 --> 16:57.442
Just so I'm clear:

16:57.480 --> 17:00.244
the defense expert argued
that the gunshot residue

17:00.280 --> 17:03.784
on Jennifer's hands
came from the struggle.

17:03.820 --> 17:05.811
Oh, so sweet.
Is that why you held out?

17:05.850 --> 17:07.056
Oh, I don't know
about that.

17:07.090 --> 17:09.809
I just tend to get a feeling.

17:09.860 --> 17:12.454
Don't I, Cyrus?

17:20.400 --> 17:25.099
(The Twilight Zone ringtone
Playing)

17:25.140 --> 17:27.176
Hi, Jackie.

17:27.210 --> 17:28.837
What's wrong?
Nothing's wrong.

17:28.880 --> 17:31.348
I was going through the laundry

17:31.380 --> 17:33.143
and I think
some of Grace's school clothes

17:33.180 --> 17:35.341
you would find inappropriate.

17:35.380 --> 17:36.608
We just moved away.

17:36.650 --> 17:39.187
Grace has left all her friends.
I need you to go easier on her.

17:39.220 --> 17:40.812
All I said was

17:40.860 --> 17:42.384
I could take her shopping
and help her find pants

17:42.420 --> 17:43.580
that would make her
look slimmer.

17:43.630 --> 17:45.359
She's at
a perfectly healthy weight.

17:45.390 --> 17:47.392
I don't want her to have
body Image Issues.

17:47.430 --> 17:49.751
She'll only have
body image issues

17:49.800 --> 17:51.119
if she keeps gaining weight.

17:51.170 --> 17:52.319
(muffled growl)

17:54.270 --> 17:55.396
Alicia.

17:55.440 --> 17:58.238
Um, we'll talk about this
when I get home later, okay?

17:58.270 --> 17:59.806
All right.
Bye.

17:59.840 --> 18:02.377
You know the new
assocrate Cary?

18:02.410 --> 18:04.776
The one in the Brioni?

18:04.810 --> 18:06.209
What? I'm observant.

18:06.250 --> 18:08.309
Yes, the one
in the Brioni.

18:08.350 --> 18:10.318
He said to me, "May
the best man win."

18:10.350 --> 18:13.114
What exactly does
he mean by that?

18:13.160 --> 18:14.184
What he means
IS something

18:14.220 --> 18:16.313
I thought we weren't
making public.

18:16.360 --> 18:18.180
What?

18:18.230 --> 18:21.154
Look, we only have one
associate position open.

18:21.200 --> 18:23.794
So we agreed to hire
two applicants,
and in six months

18:23.830 --> 18:25.366
decide which one
to retaIn.

18:25.400 --> 18:28.289
So this is a contest
between me and Cary?

18:28.340 --> 18:30.137
It was either that
or a cage match.

18:31.610 --> 18:35.273
I'm just happy
your pro bono's going well.

18:45.920 --> 18:48.753
Visiting hours
are almost over.

19:05.740 --> 19:07.605
They said a visitor.

19:07.640 --> 19:09.301
I thought Mom.

19:09.340 --> 19:11.444
I've been busy.

19:11.480 --> 19:12.606
It's good to see you.

19:17.690 --> 19:19.544
I need you to sign some things.

19:19.590 --> 19:22.616
Okay.

19:22.660 --> 19:24.582
We didn't get everything
we wanted on the house.

19:24.630 --> 19:26.621
It's a bad market to sell.

19:26.660 --> 19:29.254
I see that.

19:29.300 --> 19:31.393
We used most of it
for your court costs.

19:31.430 --> 19:32.829
The rent will come
out of my salary

19:32.870 --> 19:34.462
and the kids are
going to have

19:34.500 --> 19:36.434
to stay in
public school.
How are they?

19:36.470 --> 19:38.529
Mother says that she's
helping out around the house.

19:38.570 --> 19:40.572
They're good.

19:40.610 --> 19:41.634
Grace argues over clothes
with your mother,

19:41.680 --> 19:43.875
and Zach is using you
to make friends at school.

19:43.910 --> 19:45.571
Which I don't know
if that's a healthy thing

19:45.610 --> 19:46.645
or something worse.

19:46.680 --> 19:48.545
Using me?

19:48.580 --> 19:51.583
FunnyOrDie has a
skit about you.

19:51.620 --> 19:53.781
It's cool, I guess.

19:53.820 --> 19:55.583
Oh...

19:55.620 --> 19:57.451
here.

20:04.970 --> 20:08.462
Alicia, I know this
has been hard on you,

20:08.500 --> 20:09.865
but you have to believe me.

20:09.900 --> 20:11.629
I'm innocent...

20:11.670 --> 20:13.706
of the abuse of office charges.

20:13.740 --> 20:15.605
You think I give a damn
about that, Peter?

20:15.640 --> 20:17.676
They were playing a tape
in Grace's computer lab

20:17.710 --> 20:19.575
of you sucking the
toes of a hooker.

20:21.650 --> 20:22.548
in your employment contract?

20:22.580 --> 20:24.684
Come on, I was set up.
The state attorneys...

20:24.720 --> 20:26.585
Oh, come on, Peter.
I don't want to talk...!

20:26.620 --> 20:27.587
I'm not going to fight.

20:27.620 --> 20:28.712
I didn't come
here to fight.

20:28.760 --> 20:30.523
Mom says you're on a case.

20:30.560 --> 20:31.686
Congratulations.

20:31.730 --> 20:34.358
The fake carjacking, right?

20:34.400 --> 20:35.822
Who's the judge?

20:35.860 --> 20:37.589
Richard Cuesta.

20:37.630 --> 20:39.268
You're kidding.

20:39.300 --> 20:40.562
He hates me.

20:40.600 --> 20:41.965
I know.

20:42.000 --> 20:42.989
(P.A. buzzing)

20:43.040 --> 20:44.632
MAN:
Visiting hours are now over.

20:44.670 --> 20:46.501
Visiting hours
are now over.

20:46.540 --> 20:49.475
You know there was
something weird about
that case, don't you?

20:49.510 --> 20:50.704
The Lewis case?

20:50.750 --> 20:52.775
There was a rumor going around

20:52.810 --> 20:55.415
that something got
buried, pitted.

20:55.450 --> 20:56.644
What?

20:56.680 --> 20:57.647
Evidence

20:57.690 --> 20:59.180
or testimony.

21:03.060 --> 21:04.288
I should go.

21:04.330 --> 21:05.649
Hey, listen,

21:05.690 --> 21:07.624
thanks for playing
the breadwinner for a while.

21:07.660 --> 21:08.922
It's not going to last forever.

21:08.960 --> 21:10.791
The lawyers think
the appellate court

21:10.830 --> 21:12.525
is going to hear my case.

21:12.570 --> 21:15.289
If they overturn it,
everything goes back to normal.

21:15.340 --> 21:16.659
GUARD:
It's time.

21:16.700 --> 21:17.906
Peter,

21:17.940 --> 21:21.728
it's never going back to normal.

21:33.090 --> 21:34.216
ALICIA:
As soon as the cops found
gunshot residue

21:34.260 --> 21:36.785
on Jennifer's hands,
they had their suspect.

21:36.820 --> 21:39.527
So what if they pitted
everything else?

21:39.560 --> 21:41.323
And what if they didn't?

21:41.360 --> 21:42.588
Arguments are cheap.

21:43.900 --> 21:45.788
What's that?

21:45.830 --> 21:46.922
Page one of the
crime lab summary.

21:46.970 --> 21:48.835
I was digging through discovery.
Look at the top corner.

21:48.870 --> 21:50.428
KALINDA:
Looks like a staple.

21:50.470 --> 21:51.732
It is a staple.

21:51.770 --> 21:52.759
And that's odd because...?

21:52.810 --> 21:53.936
There's no page two.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.800
Why do they need
a staple

21:55.840 --> 21:57.569
if there's no page two?

21:57.610 --> 21:59.601
You think the cops kept
something out of the discovery

21:59.650 --> 22:01.538
that pointed to
another suspect?

22:01.580 --> 22:03.912
Well, I think either they did
or it would be helpful

22:03.950 --> 22:05.781
in court to imply
that they did.

22:05.820 --> 22:06.844
Two days away from trial

22:06.890 --> 22:08.517
and you're thinking of
dropping the old strategy?

22:08.560 --> 22:11.358
Diane barely convinced
a cat lady to acquit.

22:11.390 --> 22:14.848
So, a pickup truck
is seen racing

22:14.900 --> 22:16.754
through a well-lit,
empty parking lot.

22:16.800 --> 22:18.791
How is a truck missed by
that surveillance camera?

22:18.830 --> 22:20.695
(shutter clicks)

22:20.740 --> 22:24.608
Mismarked surveillance tape.

22:24.640 --> 22:26.733
Yeah.

22:27.840 --> 22:29.637
What are you doing?

22:29.680 --> 22:31.375
Working.

22:31.410 --> 22:34.846
These are better
than subpoenas.

22:37.120 --> 22:39.839
We just need to see how the
surveillance system works,

22:39.890 --> 22:42.051
and we'll be out of your hair
in five minutes.

22:42.090 --> 22:43.785
Five minutes?
Uh-huh.

22:43.830 --> 22:48.119
Okay, it's down here.

22:48.160 --> 22:49.798
Why did my
husband fire you?

22:49.830 --> 22:51.718
He accused me
of working two jobs.

22:51.770 --> 22:52.919
Were you?

22:52.970 --> 22:54.767
Oh, yeah.

22:54.800 --> 22:57.633
See, the computer automatically
records the surveillance.

22:57.670 --> 22:59.968
Marks it with date and time.

23:00.010 --> 23:01.807
Is that the night of the murder?
Yeah.

23:01.840 --> 23:03.705
I mean, even if the computer
did mismark it,

23:03.750 --> 23:05.672
I make an hourly tour
of the lot,

23:05.710 --> 23:07.678
and I didn't see
no pickup truck.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.073
Look, that's me.

23:09.120 --> 23:10.678
11:03, just before
the murder.

23:12.820 --> 23:14.754
Can we get copies of these?

23:14.790 --> 23:15.984
Sure.

23:18.190 --> 23:21.398
Laney! Laney!

23:23.200 --> 23:24.167
What?

23:24.200 --> 23:25.167
Give me some disks.

23:25.200 --> 23:28.397
Alright.

23:36.210 --> 23:38.178
Your machine spit out an extra
one.

23:38.210 --> 23:39.177
Would you like it?

23:39.210 --> 23:42.179
Oh.

23:42.220 --> 23:45.189
Oh, what beautiful children.

23:45.220 --> 23:47.188
Two kids, two grandkids.

23:47.220 --> 23:49.188
Hey Laney, how about those
disks?

23:49.220 --> 23:51.188
Is he always so charming?

23:51.230 --> 23:53.186
Oh, he just a lazy mall cop.

23:53.230 --> 23:55.198
He spends half the day surfing
porn

23:55.230 --> 23:56.128
and with the night shift he

23:56.160 --> 23:58.196
can't get his skinny ass out of
his chair.

23:58.230 --> 24:00.198
I'm always waking him up in the
morning.

24:00.230 --> 24:02.437
Oh. Men. (Laughing)

24:06.240 --> 24:09.937
I talked to Peter.
He said you dropped by.

24:09.980 --> 24:11.208
I did.

24:11.250 --> 24:12.569
I'm glad.

24:12.610 --> 24:13.747
He's hurting
in there.

24:13.780 --> 24:14.712
He's very brave.

24:14.750 --> 24:16.741
But he's hurting.

24:16.780 --> 24:18.247
He needs you to forgive him,
Alicia.

24:18.290 --> 24:19.939
Jackie,

24:19.990 --> 24:21.651
I spent 15 years doing
his laundry,

24:21.690 --> 24:22.714
cleaning his house,

24:22.760 --> 24:24.682
never asking a
single question

24:24.730 --> 24:25.981
because I didn't think I had to.

24:26.030 --> 24:27.827
And he took everything
I thought we had

24:27.860 --> 24:29.851
and he just put it out there
for everyone.

24:29.900 --> 24:31.527
He didn't want that.

24:31.570 --> 24:32.696
The press...

24:32.730 --> 24:33.765
Oh, Jackie,

24:33.800 --> 24:37.759
stop it, please!
Peter wasn't thinking of us.

24:37.810 --> 24:39.539
It takes time, Alicia.

24:39.570 --> 24:40.707
Give it time.

24:40.740 --> 24:43.948
Any time I have right now
is for them.

24:47.150 --> 24:48.811
(knocking on door)

24:52.590 --> 24:53.682
I want her dead.

24:53.720 --> 24:57.281
Me, too, just not quite yet.

24:57.320 --> 24:59.254
So why can't Zach and I
just watch ourselves?

24:59.290 --> 25:01.258
Honey, she's only here
a couple of hours a day.

25:01.300 --> 25:03.188
A couple very damaging hours.

25:03.230 --> 25:05.164
You'll heal.

25:06.170 --> 25:08.730
And change her ringtone.

25:08.770 --> 25:09.862
BRODY:
Please state your name.

25:09.900 --> 25:11.709
CINDY:
Cindy Lewis.

25:11.740 --> 25:13.162
And you were married
to the victim

25:13.210 --> 25:14.609
for how long,
Mrs. Lewis?

25:14.640 --> 25:17.848
Two years until... (sniffling)

25:20.850 --> 25:22.169
Thank you.
And how would
you describe

25:22.220 --> 25:24.188
your husband's relationship
with his first wife?

25:24.220 --> 25:27.189
Well, most of the time
it was fine, friendly even,

25:27.220 --> 25:28.710
but after the last
custody hearing,

25:28.760 --> 25:30.625
Michael was pretty worried
about Jennifer...

25:30.660 --> 25:31.581
Objection, Your Honor.

25:31.630 --> 25:32.619
On what grounds?

25:32.660 --> 25:34.196
Hearsay.

25:34.230 --> 25:35.822
Nice try, Mrs. Florrick.
I'll allow it.

25:35.860 --> 25:37.623
Go ahead, Mrs. Lewis.

25:37.670 --> 25:39.626
Um, he was worried
Jennifer was intent

25:39.670 --> 25:40.796
on getting sole custody.

25:40.840 --> 25:43.195
Thank you, Mrs. Lewis.

25:43.240 --> 25:44.309
Your witness.

25:44.340 --> 25:48.299
Now, Mrs. Lewis, you stated
that Michael was worried

25:48.340 --> 25:51.571
about Jennifer,
yet in the week following...

25:51.610 --> 25:52.645
Objection, Your Honor.

25:52.680 --> 25:53.908
Sustained.

25:53.950 --> 25:56.168
In your testimony, Mrs. Lewis,
you claimed

25:56.220 --> 25:57.812
that Jennifer wanted
sole custody,

25:57.850 --> 25:58.885
but isn't it true...?

25:58.920 --> 26:00.615
Objection.
Sustained.

26:00.660 --> 26:02.651
Keep trying, Mrs. Florrick.
You'll hit on it.

26:05.190 --> 26:10.992
Mrs. Lewis, whose idea was it
to have dinner,

26:11.030 --> 26:12.622
Jennifer's or Michael's?

26:12.670 --> 26:13.967
Michael's.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.865
So wouldn't that suggest
that his attitude

26:15.900 --> 26:18.061
had changed towards...?
Objection.

26:18.110 --> 26:19.202
Sustained.

26:21.340 --> 26:22.876
Thank you.

26:42.400 --> 26:45.028
Now, Detective Briggs,
the defense has referred

26:45.070 --> 26:46.890
to three unsolved
carjackings

26:46.930 --> 26:48.397
in the neighborhood
at that time.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.328
Are you aware of this?
I am.

26:50.370 --> 26:52.338
So why didn't you consider
this incident

26:52.370 --> 26:54.201
to be another in_ that series
of carjackings?

26:54.240 --> 26:55.969
First of all, they were
all luxury cars:

26:56.010 --> 26:57.671
one Lexus and two BMWs.

26:57.710 --> 26:59.905
The victim in this crime
was driving a 2001 Honda,

26:59.950 --> 27:02.145
and there was no clip
on the fuel line.

27:02.180 --> 27:04.944
This is what the carjackers did
to force the luxury cars over.

27:04.990 --> 27:06.389
That's right.

27:06.420 --> 27:08.217
But in the case of the Honda,
the victim pulled over

27:08.260 --> 27:09.659
because he had a flat.

27:09.690 --> 27:10.827
Yes, ma'am, there
was a nail driven

27:10.860 --> 27:11.929
into the front driver tire.

27:11.960 --> 27:14.099
I see. Now, why is this
something

27:14.130 --> 27:16.223
a carjacker would never do,
Detective?

27:16.260 --> 27:17.192
It would defeat the purpose.

27:17.230 --> 27:19.869
I mean, how do you steal a car
with a flat?

27:21.040 --> 27:22.439
Your witness.

27:22.470 --> 27:23.903
It's not going well, is it?

27:23.940 --> 27:25.760
It's early.

27:25.810 --> 27:26.629
CUESTA:
Mrs. Florrick?

27:26.670 --> 27:29.878
Detective Briggs,
what is "the pit"?

27:30.980 --> 27:32.106
Excuse me?

27:32.150 --> 27:34.175
In police circles,
what is "the pit"?

27:34.220 --> 27:35.209
Objection, Your Honor.

27:35.250 --> 27:36.012
On what grounds?

27:36.050 --> 27:38.314
On the grounds that...
relevance.

27:38.350 --> 27:40.045
Well, let us see
how relevant this becomes,

27:40.090 --> 27:42.388
shall we? Detective?

27:42.420 --> 27:44.456
The pit...

27:44.490 --> 27:45.525
the pit is police slang

27:45.560 --> 27:48.791
for evidence thought irrelevant
at a crime scene.

27:48.830 --> 27:51.162
So when an officer's referring
to dropping something

27:51.200 --> 27:53.737
in "the pit," or "pitting it,"
he refers to what?

27:53.770 --> 27:56.159
Excluding it from the crime
scene narrative.

27:56.200 --> 27:58.805
But that only applies
to irrelevant details.

27:58.840 --> 28:00.808
We wouldn't _exclude
pertinent eVIdence.

28:00.840 --> 28:03.331
Was anything pitted
from the Lewis crime...?

28:03.380 --> 28:04.870
Your Honor, objection!

28:04.910 --> 28:06.468
Evidence is logged in
all the time

28:06.510 --> 28:07.818
that proves irrelevant
to the discovery.

28:07.850 --> 28:09.442
It's not an_intent
to deceive.

28:09.480 --> 28:10.811
It's an attempt
to decipher facts.

28:10.850 --> 28:11.942
We don't even know
if it is anything.

28:11.990 --> 28:14.413
And to blame the prosecution for
not coming up with every

28:14.460 --> 28:15.449
single possible detail?!
She's trying to build

28:15.490 --> 28:17.310
a case on a staple...
Okay, okay, Mrs. Florrick!

28:17.360 --> 28:19.248
None of this was in
the first trial.

28:19.290 --> 28:21.497
Is it your intention
to pursue a new defense?

28:21.530 --> 28:22.895
Yes, Your Honor.

28:27.430 --> 28:29.330
Counsel's trying
to mislead the jury.

28:29.370 --> 28:30.962
She's implying there
was police corruption.

28:31.010 --> 28:31.965
Oh, shut up, Matan!

28:32.010 --> 28:32.533
Is she right?
That's the question.

28:32.570 --> 28:34.276
Did you bury something?

28:34.310 --> 28:36.073
We all know what's
gomg on here.

28:36.110 --> 28:37.771
Peter Florrick
was a corrupt

28:37.810 --> 28:39.004
and convicted
state's attorney.

28:39.050 --> 28:40.779
If evidence was buried,
he buried it.

28:40.820 --> 28:42.811
And now she's benefiting
from his knowledge.

28:42.850 --> 28:43.839
Which still leaves you

28:43.890 --> 28:45.744
with some pages missing here!

28:45.790 --> 28:47.314
I'll give you
till Monday

28:47.350 --> 28:48.510
to produce them

28:48.560 --> 28:50.152
along with any evidence
they reference.

28:50.190 --> 28:52.249
Then I'll rule
on admissibility.

28:52.290 --> 28:53.518
And you, Mrs. Florrick.

28:53.560 --> 28:57.428
I'm not sure if you're being fed
this stuff or you're doing it

28:57.460 --> 28:58.927
on your own,
but if it's the former,

28:58.970 --> 29:01.097
you're walking a very narrow

29:01.140 --> 29:03.461
ethical line here.
You understand that?

29:03.500 --> 29:05.468
Yes, Your Honor.

29:08.480 --> 29:09.299
The directive was simple.

29:09.340 --> 29:11.205
Follow the strategy
of the first trial.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.445
Instead, you're pushing
for evidence

29:13.480 --> 29:14.777
that might not even
help your case.

29:14.820 --> 29:16.515
I interviewed the first jury,
and they

29:16.550 --> 29:18.245
voted 11 to one
to conVIct.

29:18.290 --> 29:21.157
Excuse me. That's not true.
It was evenly split.

29:21.190 --> 29:22.509
No. Half the jurors
switched their votes

29:22.560 --> 29:23.788
when they couldn't get

29:23.830 --> 29:25.388
a troubled juror
to deliberate.

29:25.430 --> 29:28.354
So, I used my judgment
to change strategies.

29:29.560 --> 29:33.519
And was it your judgment
not to update us?

29:41.510 --> 29:43.978
She's a junior associate

29:44.010 --> 29:45.978
who doesn't think
she's a junior assoaate.

29:46.010 --> 29:48.012
Her husband was
the state's attorney.

29:48.050 --> 29:48.948
She lived
in Highland Park.

29:48.980 --> 29:50.470
It's not just teaching
an old dog new tricks.

29:50.520 --> 29:52.488
It's teaching an entitled dog
new tricks..

29:52.520 --> 29:54.488
Come on, Diane.
The problem is she's
catching evidence

29:54.520 --> 29:57.489
that you overlooked.

29:57.520 --> 29:59.329
I've seen you mentor these women

29:59.360 --> 30:00.429
until they start
competing with you.

30:00.460 --> 30:02.018
And then you...
What? Excuse me?

30:03.330 --> 30:12.409
I say we reprimand Alicia
and put Cary in as first chair.

30:12.440 --> 30:17.400
Thank you.

30:17.440 --> 30:19.408
(Phone Ringing)

30:19.450 --> 30:21.418
That's her, isn't it?

30:21.450 --> 30:22.417
(Phone Ringing)

30:22.450 --> 30:29.413
Sonia? Can you...

30:29.460 --> 30:31.428
Alicia Florrick's Office.

30:31.460 --> 30:34.452
One moment please.

30:39.470 --> 30:42.462
Jennifer, pick up.

30:44.470 --> 30:49.430
Hello? Hi, baby. I miss you so
much.

30:49.480 --> 30:53.439
Alicia?

30:53.480 --> 30:55.016
The pitted evidence.

30:55.050 --> 30:56.938
I talked to a friend
at the crime lab.

30:56.980 --> 30:58.481
Gave me a preview
of the evidence.

30:58.520 --> 31:00.044
A preview?

31:00.090 --> 31:01.580
It's dog hair found on
the victim's clothes.

31:01.620 --> 31:03.110
Cops pitted it

31:03.160 --> 31:05.025
because they found dog hair
at Michael's residence

31:05.060 --> 31:06.459
and thought it
was the same.

31:06.490 --> 31:07.923
But it's not?

31:07.960 --> 31:08.949
It's from an Italian
greyhound.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.127
Neither Michael
nor Jennifer had
greyhounds.

31:11.170 --> 31:13.968
There's also a chemical
on the hair.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.467
Alco Ectolin--

31:15.500 --> 31:17.263
a lotion for muscle
and j0int pain.

31:17.300 --> 31:18.267
That's the chemical
number?

31:18.310 --> 31:20.107
No, his cell number.

31:20.140 --> 31:21.573
I agreed to drinks.

31:21.610 --> 31:23.498
(chuckles)

31:23.540 --> 31:24.939
So we're looking

31:24.980 --> 31:27.039
for an arthritic
greyhound owner.

31:27.080 --> 31:30.243
We? I hear you're being
bumped to second chair.

31:30.280 --> 31:33.215
VVhen?

31:33.250 --> 31:34.558
End of tomorrow.

31:34.590 --> 31:36.182
Cary's being transitioned in.

31:36.220 --> 31:37.312
And he'll go back

31:37.360 --> 31:39.225
to the first
trial strategy.

31:39.260 --> 31:40.522
Wow.

31:40.560 --> 31:42.949
REPORTER (on TV):
It's not a good year for him.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.160
The all-star point guard
is currently suing

31:44.200 --> 31:45.360
his ex-girlfriend for damages,

31:45.400 --> 31:47.265
hoping the judge
can finally determine

31:47.300 --> 31:50.167
whether this case was fact
or fantasy.

31:50.200 --> 31:52.031
You know her simply as "Amber,"

31:52.070 --> 31:54.038
the young woman who brought down

31:54.080 --> 31:55.229
bad boy Chicago state's attorney
Peter Florrick.

31:55.280 --> 31:59.000
Though she says she wants
to leave the scandal far behind,

31:59.050 --> 32:01.041
celebrity call girl
Amber Madison

32:01.080 --> 32:04.379
has decided to write a memoir
about her time with Florrick.

32:04.420 --> 32:06.479
In this exclusive interview
with Inside Edition...

32:06.520 --> 32:08.283
JACKIE:
Do you really have to work?

32:08.320 --> 32:10.709
Yeah, ten more minutes.
Zach, I need your computer.

32:10.760 --> 32:12.978
Mom, I just raised
my wanted level.

32:13.030 --> 32:14.258
Yeah, I'm happy for you, honey.

32:14.300 --> 32:16.325
When Peter's father was on
the Illinois court,

32:16.360 --> 32:17.520
he never brought

32:17.560 --> 32:20.120
a single case home,
not once.

32:20.170 --> 32:23.367
He was a judge, Jackie.
I'm a junior associate. Zach?!

32:23.400 --> 32:24.264
I need you to play

32:24.310 --> 32:26.164
these two computer
disks side by side.

32:26.210 --> 32:29.031
Can you set up my
computer next to yours?

32:29.080 --> 32:30.229
Hey, how's your sister?

32:30.280 --> 32:32.271
She still fighting with Grandma?

32:32.310 --> 32:34.073
(chuckles)

32:40.590 --> 32:42.319
What is it?

32:42.360 --> 32:42.951
It's video

32:42.990 --> 32:43.513
of the night
of the murder.

32:43.560 --> 32:44.458
Like Faces of Death?

32:44.490 --> 32:47.288
Mm.

32:47.330 --> 32:50.549
Mom, I've seen worse.

32:50.600 --> 32:52.761
You're adorable.

32:52.800 --> 32:54.392
I'm not.

32:54.440 --> 32:55.634
Yes, you are.

32:57.670 --> 32:59.433
Zach, freeze it!

33:00.470 --> 33:01.630
What? What is it?

33:01.680 --> 33:05.707
(sighs)
It's proof.

33:05.750 --> 33:10.073
This is at 11:03 the night
of the murder, Mr. North,

33:10.120 --> 33:12.088
and... that's you

33:12.120 --> 33:16.489
making your hourly circuit
of the lot, correct?

33:16.520 --> 33:19.080
Yes, that's correct.

33:19.130 --> 33:22.691
And you saw no pickup truck,
no carjacker racing past,

33:22.730 --> 33:24.288
nothing the defendant

33:24.330 --> 33:24.762
claims she saw.

33:24.800 --> 33:25.664
That's correct.

33:25.700 --> 33:26.792
Thank you.

33:26.830 --> 33:28.263
Nothing further, Your Honor.

33:28.300 --> 33:30.359
Mrs. Florrick.

33:30.400 --> 33:33.665
Can we _have
the monitors in, please?

33:36.380 --> 33:37.733
Thank you.

33:37.780 --> 33:40.146
(quietly):
State's attorney's here.

33:40.180 --> 33:41.545
ALICIA:
Now, Mr. North...

33:41.580 --> 33:42.547
They're worried
she's getting

33:42.580 --> 33:43.547
the stuff from
her husband.

33:43.580 --> 33:44.512
ALICIA:
Here are three images.

33:44.550 --> 33:47.144
The middle is the image
of the surveillance

33:47.190 --> 33:49.511
from the 15th,
the night of the murder,

33:49.560 --> 33:52.324
and the one over there
on the left is the image

33:52.360 --> 33:54.521
from the 14th, the night
before the murder, and the one

33:54.560 --> 33:57.324
on the right is from the 16th,
the night after the murder.

33:57.360 --> 33:59.123
Can you see
the dates on those?

33:59.170 --> 34:00.489
Uh, yes, I can.

34:00.530 --> 34:02.191
So, as you said before,
there you are

34:02.240 --> 34:05.630
the night of the murder,
at 11:03,

34:05.670 --> 34:07.399
making your circuit of the lot.

34:07.440 --> 34:09.704
And... there you are
the night before the murder

34:09.740 --> 34:13.403
and the night after,
doing the same thing.

34:13.450 --> 34:15.771
It must get old.
Um, no, ma'am.

34:15.820 --> 34:18.744
My job doesn't pay as much
as yours, but I still love it.

34:18.790 --> 34:20.212
Okay. Good.

34:21.190 --> 34:23.078
ALICIA:
Now, Mr. North,

34:23.120 --> 34:26.556
let's fast-forward, shall we?

34:26.590 --> 34:29.127
45 minutes--
the night of the murder.

34:29.160 --> 34:30.252
And there.

34:30.300 --> 34:31.665
What do you see?

34:32.630 --> 34:34.495
Nothing.
No?

34:34.540 --> 34:37.429
It's right there-- maybe you
need to move in a little closer.

34:37.470 --> 34:40.735
Oh, it's a shopping bag,
it looks like a shopping bag.

34:40.770 --> 34:41.702
Actually, it is.

34:41.740 --> 34:43.378
It's a plastic shopping bag.

34:43.410 --> 34:46.208
It was a very windy night that
night, and it blew across

34:46.250 --> 34:47.478
the lot at 11:48.
Your Honor, objection.

34:47.510 --> 34:50.149
What does this have
to do with anything?
CUESTA: Beats me.

34:50.180 --> 34:52.114
But I'm interested,
aren't you, Mr. Brody?

34:52.150 --> 34:53.412
Overruled.

34:53.450 --> 34:55.589
ALICIA:
Okay, so let's fast-forward

34:55.620 --> 34:57.258
the other two monitors--

34:57.290 --> 35:00.225
the night before the murder
and the night after the murder--

35:00.260 --> 35:01.295
to the same time code.

35:01.330 --> 35:03.594
Here's the 14th...

35:03.630 --> 35:04.824
and the 16th.

35:04.870 --> 35:06.622
What do you see?

35:06.670 --> 35:09.161
Um... I don't know.

35:09.200 --> 35:10.758
I think you
do know, sir.

35:10.800 --> 35:12.700
Either you have a plastic bag

35:12.740 --> 35:15.573
that blows across your lot
every night at 11:48,

35:15.610 --> 35:17.828
or these are duplicates
of the same tape.

35:33.660 --> 35:35.355
No, it...

35:35.400 --> 35:37.527
it's not wh-what it looks like.

35:37.560 --> 35:38.766
I understand, sir.

35:38.800 --> 35:40.927
You didn't willfully
mislead the police.

35:40.970 --> 35:42.062
Yeah, that's correct.

35:42.100 --> 35:46.264
No, it's just that it gets cold
out there, and sometimes

35:46.310 --> 35:47.334
you don't make
the circuit of the lot.
Yes.

35:47.370 --> 35:49.372
So on the nights
that you don't go out,

35:49.410 --> 35:51.605
you don't record
the actual surveillance image,

35:51.650 --> 35:53.379
you set your computer up

35:53.410 --> 35:54.672
to duplicate
the night before,

35:54.720 --> 35:56.472
just in case
your manager checks it,

35:56.520 --> 35:58.715
is that correct?

35:58.750 --> 35:59.819
Yes.

35:59.850 --> 36:01.579
ALICIA:
Just so I'm clear,

36:01.620 --> 36:04.680
there is no recording
the night of the murder,

36:04.730 --> 36:07.324
and you were never there
to see or not see

36:07.360 --> 36:09.419
the pickup truck
or the carjacker.

36:10.930 --> 36:12.761
I'm sorry.

36:12.800 --> 36:15.860
Uh, yes.

36:17.900 --> 36:19.709
No further questions.

36:34.260 --> 36:37.309
So, you're wondering
whether demolishing

36:37.360 --> 36:39.328
the key prosecution witness

36:39.360 --> 36:41.726
didn't just save your ass
as first chair--

36:41.760 --> 36:42.954
nice work,
by the way--

36:43.000 --> 36:43.898
Thanks.

36:43.930 --> 36:46.490
...but was enough
for reasonable doubt.

36:46.530 --> 36:47.861
You know what hurts you?

36:47.900 --> 36:50.289
Nail in the tire.
Yep.

36:50.340 --> 36:52.467
And the old Honda.

36:52.510 --> 36:54.569
It just doesn't feel
like a carjacking.

36:54.610 --> 36:55.907
It feels like a murder

36:55.940 --> 36:58.306
made to look like a carjacking.

36:58.350 --> 37:00.238
What if I don't fight it?

37:00.280 --> 37:01.941
What, agree that
it was just a murder?

37:03.450 --> 37:04.678
Then the jury needs a suspect.

37:06.350 --> 37:10.252
(exhales)

37:10.290 --> 37:11.587
It's late.

37:11.630 --> 37:13.279
It's like old times, huh?

37:14.960 --> 37:16.257
Evidentiary procedure.

37:16.300 --> 37:17.426
(laughs)

37:17.460 --> 37:18.427
The mock trial.

37:18.470 --> 37:19.368
You remember that?

37:19.400 --> 37:20.389
How could I forget?

37:20.430 --> 37:21.533
Did we lose

37:21.570 --> 37:23.367
that one?
Yeah!

37:23.400 --> 37:24.958
(both laughing)

37:26.470 --> 37:27.607
Hi. Hi.

37:27.640 --> 37:31.303
Um, Mrs. Florrick,
I just want to say
congratulations.

37:31.350 --> 37:34.342
I heard you did well in court.

37:34.380 --> 37:36.314
Thanks, Sonia.

37:37.320 --> 37:38.412
Sonia.

37:41.020 --> 37:42.556
Heading out?

37:42.590 --> 37:45.889
Yeah. I got a breakfast meeting
with clients.

37:45.930 --> 37:48.023
What?

37:49.900 --> 37:51.697
Something just
doesn't seem right.

37:51.730 --> 37:52.924
Michael has dinner

37:52.970 --> 37:54.335
with his first wife.

37:54.370 --> 37:55.564
Right.
He tells Jennifer

37:55.600 --> 37:57.636
he misses her, misses
their old life together.

37:57.670 --> 37:59.467
Right.

37:59.510 --> 38:01.375
What does Cindy think about it?

38:01.410 --> 38:02.570
The second wife?

38:02.610 --> 38:05.340
Cindy thinks
some unhappy thoughts.

38:07.350 --> 38:08.669
Jury liked her.

38:08.720 --> 38:10.642
Get them not to.

38:18.090 --> 38:21.355
ALICIA:
What did you get
on Cindy's brother?

38:21.400 --> 38:22.128
These are his
employment records.

38:22.160 --> 38:23.491
Good. What about
the lab report?

38:23.530 --> 38:24.929
Here. But they're gonna object
the whole way.

38:24.970 --> 38:28.758
You'll need to just string
together some implications...
Mrs. Florrick.

38:30.370 --> 38:32.338
You have a moment?

38:32.370 --> 38:33.667
(quietly):
Okay.

38:37.940 --> 38:40.101
I don't think
we've ever met before.

38:40.150 --> 38:41.845
I'm Glenn Childs.

38:41.880 --> 38:43.416
We've met.

38:43.450 --> 38:45.042
You know he's using
you, don't you?

38:45.090 --> 38:47.012
Peter blames me
for his downfall.

38:47.050 --> 38:49.109
He's using you
to get to me.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.378
How do you figure?

38:52.660 --> 38:54.753
Mrs. Florrick, please.

38:54.800 --> 38:57.052
He told you about
the pitted trace evidence.

38:57.100 --> 38:59.364
Don't make yourself
collateral damage here,

38:59.400 --> 39:00.492
for your own sake.

39:00.530 --> 39:02.134
Mr. Childs,

39:04.710 --> 39:06.507
and forced me
to shield my children

39:06.540 --> 39:08.576
from every cable news station
that played it

39:08.610 --> 39:10.430
in a 24-hour rotation,

39:10.480 --> 39:13.449
that was the day
I became collateral damage.

39:13.480 --> 39:16.142
(clears throat softly)

39:16.180 --> 39:19.547
If you're worried
about my husband, Mr. Childs,

39:19.590 --> 39:21.387
you've obviously
never made a woman

39:21.420 --> 39:23.411
angry before.

39:23.460 --> 39:26.679
But good luck in court.

39:32.170 --> 39:34.491
Mrs. Lewis, did you
and the deceased

39:34.540 --> 39:37.429
sign a prenuptial agreement?

39:37.470 --> 39:38.437
Uh, yes,

39:38.470 --> 39:39.937
for tax purposes.

39:39.970 --> 39:42.575
So if the deceased were
to divorce you, let's say,

39:42.610 --> 39:43.770
in order to reunite with

39:43.810 --> 39:44.902
his first wife...
Objection.

39:44.950 --> 39:45.746
Sustained.

39:45.780 --> 39:49.568
If the deceased
were to divorce you,

39:49.620 --> 39:51.713
you would be cutoff
from his premarital savings,

39:51.750 --> 39:53.012
is that correct?
Objection.

39:53.050 --> 39:54.039
Relevance.
Sustained.

39:54.090 --> 39:55.682
Move it along, Mrs. Florrick.

39:57.820 --> 40:00.482
Mrs. Lewis,
you stated in your testimony

40:00.530 --> 40:01.451
that you were in Miami

40:01.500 --> 40:03.798
at the time of the shooting
visiting family,

40:03.830 --> 40:06.492
so the police never
suspected or questioned you.

40:06.530 --> 40:08.020
Of the murder?
No, of course not.

40:08.070 --> 40:09.037
What about your brother?

40:09.070 --> 40:10.560
Objection!
Your Honor, come on,

40:10.600 --> 40:12.465
this whole line of questioning
is a smoke screen.

40:12.510 --> 40:13.659
Mr. Brody, why
don't we wait

40:13.710 --> 40:16.429
for a whiff of smoke before
we call it a screen, please.

40:16.480 --> 40:17.777
I'll allow.

40:17.810 --> 40:19.846
The police never questioned
your brother,

40:19.880 --> 40:21.643
isn't that correct, Mrs. Lewis?

40:21.680 --> 40:23.511
Well, they had no reason to.

40:23.550 --> 40:24.812
Because he lived in Miami?

40:24.850 --> 40:26.784
Because Danny had nothing
to do with this.

40:27.750 --> 40:30.651
ALICIA:
Mrs. Lewis, the judge

40:30.690 --> 40:32.829
has admitted into evidence
the buried...

40:32.860 --> 40:33.679
Strike that.

40:34.660 --> 40:37.549
...the previously unreleased
trace evidence.

40:37.600 --> 40:39.488
He has also admitted
into eVIdence

40:39.530 --> 40:40.667
the crime lab's finding

40:40.700 --> 40:42.964
that these greyhound hairs
were covered

40:43.000 --> 40:47.209
in a chemical compound
called Alco Ectolin.

40:47.240 --> 40:49.674
Have you heard
of this?
Sorry, the chemical? No.

40:49.710 --> 40:50.734
No, neither had I.

40:50.780 --> 40:52.202
It is a lotion.

40:52.250 --> 40:56.016
It is a lotion that is used
at dog racmg tracks to ease...

40:56.050 --> 40:58.109
Objection.
Not in evidence.
Sustained.

40:58.150 --> 41:00.539
And you might want
to stay standing, Mr. Brody.

41:00.590 --> 41:02.888
I have a feeling we're nearing
your smoke screen.

41:04.690 --> 41:06.578
Mrs. Lewis, isn't it a fact

41:06.630 --> 41:08.894
that a year ago
at the time of the murder,

41:08.930 --> 41:10.795
your brother worked
at a dog track?

41:10.830 --> 41:11.660
Objection!

41:11.700 --> 41:12.769
Sustained.

41:12.800 --> 41:15.689
No further questions.

41:25.280 --> 41:27.748
You're not just
making this up?

41:27.780 --> 41:29.771
Come on, it's
a Stern, Lockhart tradition:

41:29.820 --> 41:31.913
your first jury trial--
shot of tequila.

41:31.950 --> 41:33.815
Let's go.

41:33.850 --> 41:34.919
Okay.

41:36.990 --> 41:39.652
(grunts)
Yeah, I just made that up.

41:39.690 --> 41:41.726
(laughs)

41:41.760 --> 41:42.988
(both laugh)

41:43.030 --> 41:44.258
Sounded good, though,

41:44.300 --> 41:46.564
didn't it?

41:46.600 --> 41:48.795
How long do you think
they'll stay out?

41:48.840 --> 41:51.900
Oh, I stopped guessing
about juries a while ago.

41:51.940 --> 41:54.829
How long were they out
with your husband?

41:56.610 --> 41:58.032
Six hours.

41:58.080 --> 41:59.945
Yeah?

41:59.980 --> 42:01.914
You know what I don't get?

42:01.950 --> 42:03.815
Why you stood by him.

42:03.850 --> 42:05.181
I would've stuck

42:05.220 --> 42:06.778
a knife in his heart.

42:06.820 --> 42:08.287
I always thought
I would, too.

42:08.320 --> 42:10.584
When I heard
about those other scandals,

42:10.620 --> 42:12.554
the other wives...

42:12.590 --> 42:14.285
I thought...

42:14.330 --> 42:17.026
how can you allow yourself
to be used like that?

42:18.300 --> 42:20.268
And then it happened,

42:20.300 --> 42:22.666
and I was...

42:27.310 --> 42:29.335
...unprepared.

42:29.380 --> 42:32.099
(phone vibrating)

42:33.710 --> 42:35.075
Hello?

42:35.120 --> 42:38.112
Yes.

42:38.150 --> 42:39.981
Thanks.

42:40.020 --> 42:41.885
Jury's in?

42:47.990 --> 42:50.049
Well, Mrs. Florrick,

42:50.100 --> 42:51.761
Chicago Homicide
has decided

42:51.800 --> 42:54.837
to reopen its investigation into
the murder of Michael Lewis.

42:54.870 --> 42:56.064
Detective Briggs,

42:56.100 --> 42:59.001
doing an admirable
amount of due diligence,

42:59.040 --> 43:01.099
_ has confirmed that
Cindy LeWIs's brother Danny

43:01.140 --> 43:03.631
had access
to his employer's pickup truck

43:03.680 --> 43:04.908
the week of the murder.

43:04.950 --> 43:06.144
And the dog hairs

43:06.180 --> 43:06.999
admitted into evidence

43:07.050 --> 43:09.177
match those found
at his workplace.

43:09.220 --> 43:12.314
So our state's attorney,

43:12.350 --> 43:14.045
in his radiant wisdom,

43:14.090 --> 43:17.082
has decided to withdraw
the charges against your client

43:17.120 --> 43:20.157
and pursue a case
against Mrs. Lewis's brother.

43:20.190 --> 43:22.351
Isn't that right,
Mr. Brody?

43:22.400 --> 43:25.324
All I need is a yes or no.

43:25.370 --> 43:27.258
Yes.

43:27.300 --> 43:28.289
Good.

43:28.400 --> 43:29.936
Then we're done here.

43:35.410 --> 43:38.675
(both laugh)

43:38.710 --> 43:41.645
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

43:50.260 --> 43:52.387
(The Twilight Zone ringtone
Playing)

43:52.430 --> 43:53.829
Hi, Jackie.

43:53.860 --> 43:55.794
No, it just went
a little late, that's all.

43:55.830 --> 43:57.354
I made a pot roast,
and I was wondering

43:57.400 --> 43:58.799
if you were coming home
for dinner.

43:58.830 --> 44:00.229
(laughs)

44:00.270 --> 44:01.999
What? What did I say?

44:02.040 --> 44:05.032
Nothing. It's just that's what
I always used to say to Peter.

44:05.070 --> 44:06.935
(phone beeps)

44:08.310 --> 44:09.937
Are you there?

44:09.980 --> 44:11.948
Yeah, yeah. I just need
to pick up a few things,

44:11.980 --> 44:13.709
and I'll be home soon.

44:13.750 --> 44:16.344
All right.
Jackie, I don't know
if I've said this,

44:16.380 --> 44:19.247
but thank you...
for stepping up.

44:19.290 --> 44:21.019
Of course I would.
Why wouldn't I?

44:21.050 --> 44:22.449
I'll see you soon.

44:22.490 --> 44:23.286
All right, then.

44:23.320 --> 44:24.287
Bye.

44:45.880 --> 44:47.279
Oh. Hey. Sorry.

44:47.310 --> 44:48.402
I didn't know you were here.

44:48.450 --> 44:51.248
Hi.
Just a little
office token.

44:51.280 --> 44:53.316
You did great.

44:53.350 --> 44:54.988
Thanks.

44:55.020 --> 44:56.248
I did,

44:56.290 --> 44:57.416
didn't I?
(laughs)

44:57.460 --> 45:00.224
Oh, one more thing.

45:00.260 --> 45:01.249
Yes, sir?

45:01.290 --> 45:03.121
You've been made my second chair

45:03.160 --> 45:05.128
in the civil case.

45:05.170 --> 45:07.889
I'll see you tomorrow at 9:30,
staff meeting.

45:07.930 --> 45:10.865
I'll be there.

45:17.540 --> 45:19.076
(sighs)

45:19.110 --> 45:20.475
(beep)

45:24.280 --> 45:25.986
PETER:
Hey, it's me.

45:26.020 --> 45:29.057
I'm sorry, you must be in bed,
but I just wanted to tell you,

45:29.090 --> 45:32.526
the * court
agreed to hear my case.

45:32.560 --> 45:34.858
I still can't believe it.

45:34.900 --> 45:37.027
The lawyers think
we have a really good shot

45:37.060 --> 45:38.152
at overturning this,
and they're gonna make

45:38.200 --> 45:39.963
an official statement tomorrow.

45:40.000 --> 45:44.039
But, uh, I just wanted
to tell you first.

45:44.070 --> 45:46.402
I'll see you soon.

45:46.440 --> 45:48.806
I love you.
