WEBVTT

00:01.785 --> 00:03.702
I hear you're some kind of
fixer for the Governor now.

00:03.703 --> 00:05.388
Doing for him like
you used to do for me.

00:05.389 --> 00:06.798
I just saw Doug O'Casey.

00:06.799 --> 00:08.399
You've still got a
thing for him, don't you?

00:08.400 --> 00:11.596
There's the Cat I remember,
larceny in her veins.

00:11.597 --> 00:13.959
The Golden Road InterFaith Congregation.

00:13.960 --> 00:15.950
I don't think the church is a scam.

00:15.951 --> 00:18.436
We have a hijacking. I need you. Now.

00:18.437 --> 00:19.672
Every time you lose,

00:19.673 --> 00:21.586
- a hostage goes free.
- Deal.

00:21.587 --> 00:22.988
You think I'm still in love with Cat?

00:22.989 --> 00:24.038
Yes, I do.

00:24.039 --> 00:25.562
There is still something there.

00:26.642 --> 00:28.198
It's her again.

00:28.199 --> 00:29.756
You have my full attention.

00:29.757 --> 00:30.916
I can tell.

00:32.208 --> 00:33.668
You gotta stop dealing drugs.

00:33.669 --> 00:35.225
My dad was Shorepound Gang.

00:35.226 --> 00:36.321
It's who I am.

00:36.322 --> 00:38.655
Who you are right now is just dumb.

01:19.466 --> 01:20.965
Oh, my...

01:23.269 --> 01:25.837
Petra?

01:28.374 --> 01:30.776
Oh, my God.

01:30.777 --> 01:32.778
- Petra.
- _

02:05.511 --> 02:08.937
Petra, it's Cat. I need
you to call me, okay?

02:08.937 --> 02:10.215
Right away.

02:10.216 --> 02:12.281
I'm worried about you.

02:13.110 --> 02:14.744
Come on, come on, come on.

02:14.745 --> 02:17.313
Doesn't anyone answer
their phone anymore?

02:17.314 --> 02:18.480
Jake, it's Cat.

02:18.481 --> 02:19.816
I think something's happened to Petra.

02:19.817 --> 02:22.018
Something bad.

02:22.019 --> 02:25.154
You need to call me
back, okay? Call me back.

02:26.590 --> 02:27.857
Jake?

02:27.858 --> 02:29.992
Hey, Kitty Cat.

02:29.993 --> 02:31.594
Doug.

02:31.595 --> 02:33.129
Miss me?

02:33.130 --> 02:35.297
What have you done?

02:35.298 --> 02:37.566
You know, Petra came here to see me.

02:37.567 --> 02:38.868
You listen to me.

02:38.869 --> 02:41.637
If you touch a hair on
her head, I will kill you.

02:41.638 --> 02:43.572
You understand?

02:43.573 --> 02:46.475
Oh, better watch that temper, Cat.

02:46.476 --> 02:48.844
Unless you want Petra dead.

02:48.845 --> 02:50.579
You have to come pay me a visit.

02:50.580 --> 02:52.180
It's been too long.

02:52.181 --> 02:55.083
We need a little face time together.

02:55.084 --> 02:56.585
Today.

02:56.586 --> 02:58.853
I'll be there.

03:01.758 --> 03:02.924
She go for it?

03:02.925 --> 03:05.527
I know Cat.

03:05.528 --> 03:06.928
She's on her way.

03:06.929 --> 03:08.430
Good.

03:08.431 --> 03:10.999
'Cause as much as I
enjoy making new friends,

03:11.000 --> 03:12.968
the accommodation and the food here

03:12.969 --> 03:15.571
leaves a lot to be desired.

03:30.119 --> 03:32.020
Good morning.

03:58.947 --> 04:00.580
- Hey, Wyatt.
- Hey.

04:00.581 --> 04:01.949
Come on, I'll buy you breakfast.

04:01.950 --> 04:03.184
No, I already ordered.

04:03.185 --> 04:05.252
I know a great diner
just up by the prison.

04:05.253 --> 04:07.154
Come on.

04:09.757 --> 04:11.997
Why do I feel like I'm coming
in halfway through a movie?

04:13.061 --> 04:15.562
Cat called. She's concerned about Petra.

04:15.563 --> 04:17.596
And also, those mercenaries
from the airplane?

04:17.598 --> 04:19.499
They're cozying up to Doug O'Casey.

04:19.500 --> 04:22.069
You think Doug needs a visit?

04:22.070 --> 04:23.704
Yeah, I do.

04:23.705 --> 04:25.005
Come on, you're driving.

04:34.014 --> 04:35.549
The girl came through.

04:35.550 --> 04:36.949
Check it out.

04:38.453 --> 04:40.987
It's good for 30 yards.

04:40.988 --> 04:42.822
Only one shot.

04:45.192 --> 04:47.060
We'll make it count.

04:47.061 --> 04:49.896
This time, we get paid in full.

05:07.013 --> 05:09.081
You're a sight for sore eyes, Cat.

05:09.082 --> 05:10.349
Oh, well, thank you.

05:10.350 --> 05:12.442
It was definitely a priority for me,

05:12.443 --> 05:13.619
looking good for you.

05:13.620 --> 05:16.081
In fact, I got the
Prison Special Makeover

05:16.082 --> 05:17.757
at the salon by the bus stop before

05:17.758 --> 05:21.394
I raced my ass over here
to save Petra from you.

05:21.395 --> 05:22.995
You never needed much help looking good.

05:22.996 --> 05:25.631
And you never needed any help
messing up people's lives.

05:25.632 --> 05:27.232
Where is she?

05:27.233 --> 05:29.268
Well, this is kind of sweet, isn't it?

05:29.269 --> 05:31.436
Mom and Dad arguing over the kid.

05:31.437 --> 05:34.472
Maybe we should ground
her, give her a time out.

05:34.473 --> 05:36.541
You know, I thought
your prison fantasies

05:36.542 --> 05:37.809
would be a lot racier

05:37.810 --> 05:40.311
than a "Leave It to Beaver" scenario.

05:40.312 --> 05:42.579
I'm just warming up.

05:45.217 --> 05:46.450
There's been a breach!

05:48.111 --> 05:50.154
What is going on?!

05:50.155 --> 05:51.623
You said you wanted to see Petra.

05:51.624 --> 05:54.024
Whatever he tells you to do, you do it.

05:55.294 --> 05:56.628
Come on.

05:56.629 --> 05:59.531
Last time you tussled with
me, you ended up in here.

05:59.532 --> 06:01.898
Yeah, this time, it's getting us out.

06:05.203 --> 06:06.603
Nothing between us now.

06:06.604 --> 06:08.906
That's what this was
about? A jail break?

06:08.907 --> 06:11.943
Get ready for the
adrenaline rush of your life.

06:50.214 --> 06:53.216
Get on the ground! Down!

06:56.220 --> 06:58.320
Freeze!

06:59.824 --> 07:01.558
Get down!

07:01.559 --> 07:03.392
Down on the ground!

07:04.996 --> 07:06.462
Stay where you are.

07:13.437 --> 07:14.837
All right, everybody down!

07:14.838 --> 07:16.139
Stay in your seats!

07:16.140 --> 07:17.874
You remember how we play
the Wife and Kids angle?

07:17.875 --> 07:19.175
Do not move!

07:19.176 --> 07:21.811
- What if I don't?
- Then Petra dies.

07:21.812 --> 07:23.246
And if I help you?

07:23.247 --> 07:25.414
Then she's surfing
before the sun even sets.

07:27.485 --> 07:28.518
Open the gate.

07:28.519 --> 07:31.220
I can't. Only the warden can.

07:34.225 --> 07:37.494
Open the gate, or we'll
kill your wife and your kids.

07:37.495 --> 07:38.761
We know where you live.

07:38.762 --> 07:40.429
1127 Mangrove.

07:40.430 --> 07:41.531
We know the name of your wife,

07:41.532 --> 07:43.132
and we know the name of your kids.

07:43.133 --> 07:44.800
Alycia, Levi, Tammy.

07:44.801 --> 07:48.337
We have a man outside
your door right now.

07:48.338 --> 07:49.672
I don't believe you.

07:49.673 --> 07:51.974
Want to take that chance?

07:51.975 --> 07:55.077
I push a button or you do.

08:03.319 --> 08:05.922
Get out of that damn
booth. Open that gate.

08:07.424 --> 08:09.686
Take the gun and put it to his
head for all the cameras to see.

08:09.687 --> 08:11.561
- What?
- Show the world that Bonnie and Clyde

08:11.562 --> 08:13.562
are back together again.

08:13.563 --> 08:15.163
You're a bastard.

08:21.537 --> 08:24.138
Go! Now, go, go!

08:24.139 --> 08:26.041
You gave her the gun?
What? Are you crazy?

08:26.042 --> 08:27.741
We'll find out.

08:28.844 --> 08:30.411
We make a great team.

08:30.412 --> 08:31.947
It was always gonna be me and you, Cat.

08:31.948 --> 08:34.304
You're a psychopath.

08:34.306 --> 08:36.484
Go! Move!

08:53.235 --> 08:55.269
Drop the guns!

08:55.270 --> 08:57.037
Now!

09:01.610 --> 09:03.177
Toss me those keys!

09:07.149 --> 09:09.183
If you follow us, the guard is dead.

09:09.184 --> 09:11.050
Do you understand?

09:15.491 --> 09:18.024
Go, go, go, go!

09:21.009 --> 09:22.209
I don't know what's going on,

09:22.210 --> 09:23.544
but I got spare keys in
the glove compartment.

09:23.545 --> 09:25.813
- Come on.
- Stand down!

09:25.814 --> 09:28.115
We hold back. Cat's in play.

09:28.116 --> 09:30.117
Even if she is, how do we
help if we're not there?

09:30.118 --> 09:32.151
We find a way.

09:33.255 --> 09:36.090
An island-wide manhunt
has been launched after

09:36.091 --> 09:40.361
a female civilian helped break
four maximum-security prisoners

09:40.362 --> 09:42.430
out of the 130-year-old prison.

09:42.431 --> 09:44.231
We could have gotten
O'Casey off the Reef

09:44.232 --> 09:45.700
with one stroke of the pen.

09:47.202 --> 09:50.069
One damn phone call.

09:50.070 --> 09:53.172
Instead, I listened to you.

09:53.173 --> 09:55.442
I believe, sir, we were both dubious...

09:55.443 --> 09:57.811
Cat Chambers just played us for fools,

09:57.812 --> 09:59.446
and now she's helped the
most dangerous criminals

09:59.447 --> 10:00.714
on the island escape.

10:00.715 --> 10:02.015
I don't believe that.

10:02.016 --> 10:04.517
You don't believe your own eyes?

10:07.321 --> 10:09.088
Why was she there in the first place?

10:09.089 --> 10:11.035
She has no conceivable reason

10:11.036 --> 10:12.407
for wanting those men at large.

10:12.408 --> 10:14.895
Doug O'Casey tried to
kill her once before.

10:14.896 --> 10:16.396
And you don't think I'd
look like a damn fool

10:16.397 --> 10:18.197
if I stood up there and said that?

10:18.198 --> 10:22.334
Perception is reality,
Lieutenant Governor.

10:23.503 --> 10:25.383
I want them all found
and brought to justice,

10:25.384 --> 10:26.672
including her.

10:26.673 --> 10:30.242
If RPD doesn't have them in 24 hours,

10:30.243 --> 10:32.377
I'm calling out the National Guard.

10:36.917 --> 10:39.149
This is the greatest
threat to the public safety

10:39.150 --> 10:41.454
of the Reef in recent history.

10:41.455 --> 10:45.624
We're going to deploy every
resource at the RPD's disposal.

10:46.760 --> 10:48.160
5, 10, 19.

10:52.165 --> 10:54.199
Air unit standing by.

10:54.200 --> 10:56.134
These are the four
individuals that we are

10:56.135 --> 10:57.470
currently searching for.

10:57.471 --> 11:01.073
They are considered to
be armed and dangerous.

11:01.074 --> 11:04.676
Doug O'Casey, currently
serving 12 to 18 years

11:04.677 --> 11:06.144
at the Reef Island Correctional

11:06.145 --> 11:08.713
for racketeering and attempted murder.

11:08.714 --> 11:12.250
Cat Chambers, former member
of the Shorepound Syndicate.

11:12.251 --> 11:13.518
Accused, never convicted.

11:13.519 --> 11:16.654
James Rogers and Wesley Taylor,

11:16.655 --> 11:20.025
A.K.A. Pink and Cher.

11:20.026 --> 11:23.661
They are ex-military and
trained professional killers

11:23.662 --> 11:26.663
and should be approached
with extreme caution.

11:31.570 --> 11:33.271
You know this isn't gonna end well

11:33.272 --> 11:34.772
for either of us, right?

11:34.773 --> 11:36.941
Don't worry. I have a plan.

11:36.942 --> 11:39.342
You always do.

11:40.278 --> 11:41.713
I personally will assume

11:41.714 --> 11:43.781
tactical command of this mission,

11:43.782 --> 11:45.850
and Sergeant Ellis will supervise

11:45.851 --> 11:47.318
deployment on the ground.

11:47.319 --> 11:50.622
We have divided the Reef
into these seven blocs

11:50.623 --> 11:55.192
on the grid, and your Tac
sheets will assign you to a bloc.

11:55.193 --> 11:58.730
Good luck, everyone, and be careful.

12:04.770 --> 12:06.303
That's not what I expected to see.

12:06.304 --> 12:07.338
Cat holding the gun.

12:07.339 --> 12:09.040
What, you think Cat
called me about the prison

12:09.041 --> 12:11.175
just so we could watch
her break Doug out?

12:11.176 --> 12:12.709
Something happened behind those walls.

12:12.710 --> 12:14.078
She had to think on her feet.

12:14.079 --> 12:15.513
Radio call, all units.

12:15.514 --> 12:16.813
This is Cole, copy.

12:16.814 --> 12:19.183
Possible I.D. on black
truck escaped vehicle,

12:19.184 --> 12:22.219
corner lot, 2700 block of Vista Street.

12:22.220 --> 12:23.786
Copy that. On our way.

12:50.214 --> 12:51.472
Don't shoot!

12:51.473 --> 12:52.882
It's okay. We're RPD.

12:52.883 --> 12:54.517
- Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

12:54.518 --> 12:56.519
- My family...
- We sent a car to your place.

12:56.520 --> 12:57.953
They're fine.

12:59.022 --> 13:01.724
Did they give you any idea
where they might be headed?

13:02.793 --> 13:04.194
Doug's resources,
they're gonna be halfway

13:04.195 --> 13:05.361
across the Pacific by now.

13:05.362 --> 13:06.862
I doubt it.

13:06.863 --> 13:09.165
What makes you so sure?

13:09.166 --> 13:10.600
It's personal.

13:35.125 --> 13:37.093
What is this place?

13:37.094 --> 13:38.494
Old avocado farm.

13:38.495 --> 13:39.561
Anyone else know about it?

13:39.562 --> 13:41.997
Nobody above ground.
Make yourselves at home.

13:43.366 --> 13:44.834
Come on.

13:44.835 --> 13:46.468
I need you with me now.

13:46.469 --> 13:48.070
Bonnie and Clyde.

13:48.071 --> 13:52.574
You ever notice how
her name comes first?

13:52.575 --> 13:53.742
I've done everything you've asked.

13:53.743 --> 13:56.278
Where's Petra?

13:56.279 --> 13:58.212
Follow me.

13:58.881 --> 14:01.315
There's fresh gear in the bedrooms.

14:05.955 --> 14:07.655
Where is she?

14:11.261 --> 14:13.362
- Where is...
- Cat?

14:13.363 --> 14:15.363
Petra, my God.

14:16.599 --> 14:17.666
Are you okay?

14:17.667 --> 14:19.801
Of course I am.

14:19.802 --> 14:21.835
This is where I belong.

14:26.241 --> 14:28.208
Oh, my God.

14:29.778 --> 14:31.178
You played me.

14:32.648 --> 14:35.216
And you...

14:35.217 --> 14:36.584
You're working with him?

14:36.585 --> 14:39.353
I told you who I am.

14:39.354 --> 14:40.721
But you didn't listen to me.

14:40.722 --> 14:42.856
You know what you are? A dumb teenager.

14:42.857 --> 14:44.225
That's what you are.

14:44.226 --> 14:45.726
Tell her to leave.

14:45.727 --> 14:48.629
Make her leave, and I will stay with you

14:48.630 --> 14:50.097
as long as you want, okay?

14:50.098 --> 14:51.566
I'm not going anywhere.

14:51.567 --> 14:53.834
You don't know what you've done!

15:00.775 --> 15:03.043
One big, happy family.

15:09.048 --> 15:11.518
All units are to
manually report your location.

15:11.519 --> 15:14.855
All units are to manually
report your location.

15:14.856 --> 15:16.390
Chief.

15:17.692 --> 15:20.426
How is that you and
Jake Elliot just happened

15:20.427 --> 15:23.462
to be at the prison right
before the breakout occurred?

15:23.463 --> 15:25.799
Jake got a tip that
there was trouble brewing

15:25.800 --> 15:27.632
with O'Casey and the airplane hijackers.

15:27.633 --> 15:30.635
We got there too late to do anything.

15:30.636 --> 15:34.039
If I'd had a clean shot,
I would've taken it.

15:34.040 --> 15:35.607
I believe you.

15:35.608 --> 15:37.342
As a matter of fact, you and Jake are

15:37.343 --> 15:40.512
my most valuable pieces
of manpower right now.

15:40.513 --> 15:42.915
Nobody knows Cat Chambers
better than you do.

15:42.916 --> 15:44.416
Cat wouldn't have had any part in this.

15:44.417 --> 15:45.584
Not voluntarily.

15:45.585 --> 15:47.686
Are you speaking professionally?

15:47.687 --> 15:49.988
Like the Chief said,

15:49.989 --> 15:51.423
nobody knows Cat like I do.

15:51.424 --> 15:53.491
I expect you to honor your shield

15:53.492 --> 15:55.293
and reward my faith in you.

15:55.294 --> 15:56.661
Yes, Chief.

15:56.662 --> 15:58.296
Help bring her back safely,

15:58.297 --> 16:00.866
and she'll have her day in court.

16:02.801 --> 16:03.901
Not hungry?

16:03.902 --> 16:06.871
- No.
- Suit yourself.

16:06.872 --> 16:08.373
It's not bad.

16:08.374 --> 16:10.141
Mr. Pink knows his way around a kitchen.

16:10.142 --> 16:12.076
... inmates in
today's violent prison break...

16:12.077 --> 16:13.311
Let me ask you something.

16:13.312 --> 16:14.946
You're already out of jail.

16:14.947 --> 16:16.814
You don't need these bozos here anymore.

16:16.815 --> 16:19.683
So why are they still here?

16:21.019 --> 16:23.955
They might be useful
for some... business.

16:23.956 --> 16:26.022
Business.

16:27.293 --> 16:30.562
You're planning a score.

16:30.563 --> 16:32.464
Well, why didn't you say so, Doug?

16:32.465 --> 16:34.399
That changes everything.

16:34.400 --> 16:36.500
Cut them out. Deal me in.

16:36.501 --> 16:37.768
You giving the orders now?

16:37.769 --> 16:40.437
No, it's just basic math.

16:40.438 --> 16:43.507
If you cut them out, we
only have to split the pot

16:43.508 --> 16:45.075
between the two of us.

16:45.076 --> 16:46.377
We both win.

16:46.378 --> 16:47.711
Dealing yourself in?

16:47.712 --> 16:49.280
That's my Cat.

16:49.281 --> 16:52.048
You said you wanted it
to be like old times.

16:52.049 --> 16:54.550
I'm just giving you what you want.

16:57.255 --> 16:59.523
This is 90 minutes before the breakout.

17:03.361 --> 17:04.494
I knew it.

17:04.496 --> 17:06.896
I knew Petra would find her way to Doug.

17:06.897 --> 17:09.566
I just didn't realize how
quickly he'd brainwash her.

17:09.567 --> 17:11.300
Thanks, TJ.

17:11.301 --> 17:12.769
You think they're still on the Reef?

17:12.770 --> 17:14.671
I do.

17:14.672 --> 17:16.939
You know, back in the day,
the Shorepound used to keep

17:16.940 --> 17:19.108
a lot of bolt-holes
all across the island.

17:19.108 --> 17:20.576
Do you remember their locations?

17:20.577 --> 17:21.844
Yeah, I do.

17:21.845 --> 17:24.579
Which is why they
won't be at any of them.

17:24.580 --> 17:28.653
All right, so two choices
then... beach or mountain.

17:28.654 --> 17:30.353
Pah, I don't know.

17:30.354 --> 17:31.621
But Petra might.

17:31.622 --> 17:32.888
No, do you really think
he's gonna trust her

17:32.889 --> 17:34.256
with that kind of information?

17:34.257 --> 17:37.593
Cat, Doug, two mercenaries who
can't show their face in public?

17:37.594 --> 17:39.796
16-year-old girl, she can.

17:39.797 --> 17:42.198
Groceries, supplies... that's
what he's gonna use her for.

17:42.199 --> 17:44.204
I'll put a description out on the radio.

17:44.205 --> 17:46.095
I need you to stock us up.

17:46.096 --> 17:47.488
If you're not back in two hours,

17:47.489 --> 17:49.905
we assume you're
grabbed and we're blown.

17:49.906 --> 17:51.773
You even suspect you
get made, you keep going.

17:51.774 --> 17:53.642
- You understand?
- Got it.

18:00.750 --> 18:03.118
He says that both visitors and inmates

18:03.119 --> 18:06.055
were threatened with violence
while the female civilian,

18:06.056 --> 18:07.890
now identified as Cat Chambers...

18:10.360 --> 18:12.494
... allowing the prisoners to escape.

18:12.495 --> 18:14.230
A black van was seen leaving...

18:14.231 --> 18:16.365
That's the mug shot
they chose to use of me?

18:16.366 --> 18:17.666
Couldn't they have used the one where

18:17.667 --> 18:19.700
the lighting was better
in the booking room?

18:21.270 --> 18:23.338
You know what I was thinking?

18:23.339 --> 18:25.706
Wouldn't it be fun if we
had a deck of playing cards?

18:25.707 --> 18:27.008
Well, I don't.

18:27.009 --> 18:28.442
Why, you have something else in mind?

18:28.443 --> 18:29.510
No.

18:29.511 --> 18:30.678
I just don't want to play with you.

18:30.679 --> 18:32.981
- Why?
- You cheat.

18:32.982 --> 18:34.349
I think you're scared of me.

18:34.350 --> 18:36.650
- I'm not scared of you.
- Yeah, you are.

18:36.651 --> 18:38.987
No, I know how you play
with people's minds.

18:38.988 --> 18:40.154
Oh, yeah.

18:40.155 --> 18:42.757
Doug's been inside for too
long to know who you really are.

18:42.758 --> 18:45.459
And who's that?

18:45.460 --> 18:46.761
You're a conniving bitch.

18:46.762 --> 18:48.329
Ouch!

18:48.330 --> 18:51.399
And as entertaining as
it is to keep you here,

18:51.400 --> 18:53.267
we're done with you.

18:53.268 --> 18:54.935
You've served your purpose,

18:54.936 --> 18:56.903
regardless of what Doug thinks.

18:58.626 --> 18:59.726
Okay, fine, you know what?

18:59.727 --> 19:00.861
I'll just leave, and you guys

19:00.862 --> 19:02.263
can explain to Doug why I'm...

19:02.264 --> 19:04.231
You ain't leaving.

19:04.232 --> 19:07.267
Get your hands off me.

19:08.670 --> 19:11.605
We're gonna sit around, let
her fleece us again, huh?

19:11.606 --> 19:13.507
- Get her out of here.
- I said let me go!

19:13.508 --> 19:14.675
Gag her.

19:14.676 --> 19:17.278
Aah!

19:17.279 --> 19:19.847
What the hell, Doug?

19:21.783 --> 19:23.784
You got a problem with the lady, too?

19:28.889 --> 19:30.924
You shot him in cold blood.

19:30.925 --> 19:34.393
What if I told you it was an accident?

19:34.394 --> 19:38.131
Besides, looks like I made
you a whole lot richer.

19:38.132 --> 19:39.632
And relax.

19:39.633 --> 19:41.000
Her money comes out of my half.

19:41.001 --> 19:44.670
So you had this all figured out, yeah?

19:44.671 --> 19:46.873
Huh?

19:48.675 --> 19:50.176
I say something funny to you?

19:50.177 --> 19:51.344
Oh, yeah.

19:51.345 --> 19:54.347
She's fooled us both, man.

21:40.305 --> 21:41.840
Attention all units.

21:41.841 --> 21:45.076
Code 3 to the 4100 block of
Mountain Road, shots fired.

21:45.077 --> 21:47.278
Repeat, Code 3, all units.

21:47.279 --> 21:48.780
That ain't good. Light her up.

22:05.898 --> 22:08.533
Yeah, Shorepound hottie
O'Casey got his ex-girlfriend

22:08.534 --> 22:11.135
to break him out of prison,
and now they're on the run.

22:11.136 --> 22:13.004
It's so romantic.

22:13.005 --> 22:15.305
Yeah, like Bonnie and Clyde.

22:15.306 --> 22:16.774
I love true crime.

22:16.775 --> 22:18.675
... the other inmates,
who were awaiting trial

22:18.676 --> 22:20.377
on terrorism charges.

22:20.378 --> 22:21.898
Do you want to make a podcast together?

22:23.782 --> 22:26.049
Hey!

22:26.050 --> 22:29.152
Do not, under any
circumstances, approach

22:29.153 --> 22:31.725
any of the escapees,
as they are considered

22:31.726 --> 22:33.757
armed and dangerous.

22:36.861 --> 22:37.961
Hi.

22:37.962 --> 22:40.163
I-I-I want to report a sighting
from the prison break.

22:40.164 --> 22:41.865
Yeah.

22:41.866 --> 22:43.766
Cat Chambers.

22:50.841 --> 22:54.243
Think she's out there
playing hide and seek.

22:54.244 --> 22:56.378
Gonna run home like a puppy?

22:56.379 --> 22:57.980
I never had a puppy.

22:57.981 --> 23:00.650
Must be why you became a criminal.

23:00.651 --> 23:03.118
No, I was born this way.

23:03.119 --> 23:05.187
The rules I live by are my own.

23:05.188 --> 23:07.490
Mr. Cher was like that.

23:07.491 --> 23:09.759
Lived by his own code.

23:09.760 --> 23:12.661
Are you gonna make a speech about him?

23:18.602 --> 23:20.837
Is this gonna be a problem?

23:20.838 --> 23:24.439
You can take 100K right now, walk away.

23:24.440 --> 23:26.575
Turn your back on the
score of a lifetime.

23:26.576 --> 23:27.676
Huh?

23:27.677 --> 23:30.078
Payback?

23:30.079 --> 23:32.046
Or payday?

23:32.047 --> 23:33.714
You decide.

23:46.829 --> 23:47.829
It's quiet.

23:47.830 --> 23:49.831
How long before backup arrives?

23:49.832 --> 23:51.933
No, I don't want to wait.

23:53.803 --> 23:55.604
I'll take the back.

24:26.368 --> 24:29.170
 ... was the recent
notorious criminal organization.

24:29.171 --> 24:31.538
That is until Chambers' testimony

24:31.539 --> 24:34.508
against her ex-partner...

24:34.509 --> 24:35.675
Doug, where did you guys all...

24:35.676 --> 24:37.477
Petra?

24:37.478 --> 24:38.645
Who else is here?

24:38.646 --> 24:41.480
Like I would tell you.

24:42.983 --> 24:46.386
Where are they? Where's Cat?

24:46.387 --> 24:48.522
This isn't a game. There
are lives at stake here.

24:48.523 --> 24:51.291
Yours included. This
ain't a kid's game anymore.

24:51.292 --> 24:53.560
This is aiding and abetting
hard-core fugitives,

24:53.561 --> 24:55.195
and... You know what? Just cuff her.

24:55.196 --> 24:57.664
Let's let the backup do the sweep.

24:57.665 --> 24:59.499
You two losers have
been sniffing around Cat

24:59.500 --> 25:00.700
since she came back to the Reef.

25:00.701 --> 25:01.957
Now she chose Doug.

25:01.958 --> 25:03.270
You chose Doug.

25:03.271 --> 25:05.038
That decision's gonna haunt you.

25:11.044 --> 25:13.679
Hi. You're looking for
Cat Chambers? I saw her.

25:13.680 --> 25:17.116
She came in here, she...
Come on, I'll show you.

25:31.131 --> 25:32.831
Unit 20, what's your location?

25:32.832 --> 25:34.800
We're headed northbound...

25:39.005 --> 25:40.638
1033, all units.

25:40.639 --> 25:43.475
Reported sighting of suspect
Doug O'Casey at Canning Road,

25:43.476 --> 25:44.976
downtown Nimitz Bay.

25:44.977 --> 25:48.513
Repeat, all available units,
respond to Canning Road,

25:48.514 --> 25:50.781
downtown Nimitz Bay.

25:50.782 --> 25:51.782
Copy.

25:51.783 --> 25:53.218
Sending special unit 12 now.

25:53.219 --> 25:55.186
- Do not approach...
- This is Porter.

25:55.187 --> 25:57.122
We're nearby the address. On our way.

26:16.074 --> 26:18.742
I need your help.

26:34.841 --> 26:36.198
Okay.

26:36.199 --> 26:38.000
Maeve, you are a life saver.

26:38.001 --> 26:39.902
Now can we get the hell out of here?

26:39.903 --> 26:41.036
Yes, doll.

26:41.037 --> 26:43.338
Just checking all quadrants for any sign

26:43.339 --> 26:46.050
of that pesky police dragnet.

26:46.051 --> 26:47.552
Have a nice day.

26:47.553 --> 26:49.787
Let's go, go, go, go, go.

26:55.894 --> 26:57.095
Okay, listen to me.

26:57.096 --> 26:59.396
For the record, I was set up.

26:59.397 --> 27:01.532
For the record, I didn't ask.

27:03.001 --> 27:06.637
Oh, uh, I picked up a change
of clothes for you on the way.

27:06.638 --> 27:07.872
It's in the bag there.

27:07.873 --> 27:09.506
Did bring the signal jammer?

27:09.507 --> 27:13.111
Yes. You've got 30 seconds.

27:20.953 --> 27:21.986
Cat?

27:21.987 --> 27:23.554
How did you know it was me?

27:23.555 --> 27:24.989
Who else would it be?

27:24.990 --> 27:27.892
Your little disappearing act
this morning has me mystified.

27:27.893 --> 27:29.993
Listen to me, Jake, I
don't have much time.

27:29.994 --> 27:31.662
Doug is coming for you

27:31.663 --> 27:34.298
because he thinks you stole me from him.

27:34.299 --> 27:35.566
Time's up.

27:35.567 --> 27:37.501
Don't believe everything you hear.

27:37.502 --> 27:39.469
- Promise me.
- Now!

27:42.106 --> 27:44.241
Cat?

27:44.242 --> 27:46.543
Cat?

27:57.389 --> 27:58.789
Welcome.

27:58.790 --> 27:59.890
I'll take it from here.

27:59.891 --> 28:02.559
News flash, she's radioactive.

28:02.560 --> 28:05.361
I told you this place is a home
for those who have no home.

28:06.430 --> 28:07.563
- Hey.
- Hm?

28:07.564 --> 28:08.765
Drinks at the Point Bar on me

28:08.766 --> 28:10.400
if I make it through this in one piece.

28:10.401 --> 28:11.768
You're learning.

28:11.769 --> 28:12.969
Thank you, Maeve.

28:12.970 --> 28:15.371
All good, doll.

28:15.372 --> 28:16.706
Come on.

28:16.707 --> 28:18.440
Let's get inside.

28:24.381 --> 28:25.682
So you can help me?

28:25.683 --> 28:27.851
"Seek refuge in a dwelling

28:27.852 --> 28:29.384
and look down before up."

28:29.385 --> 28:31.730
Okay, I don't have time for a sermon.

28:31.731 --> 28:33.540
I've been on the lam

28:33.541 --> 28:35.056
for a lot longer than you have.

28:35.057 --> 28:38.893
Always knew I might need to
disappear at a moment's notice.

28:38.894 --> 28:40.671
Leads all the way to the river.

28:40.672 --> 28:41.762
Secret jetty.

28:41.763 --> 28:43.530
Why are you helping me?

28:44.700 --> 28:46.401
Well, you helped me once.

28:46.402 --> 28:48.269
Now it's my turn.

28:48.270 --> 28:50.205
Thank you.

28:55.478 --> 28:58.275
- No, this is not what we talked about.
- He put us both away.

28:58.276 --> 29:00.102
We take him out, or we're
looking over our shoulder

29:00.103 --> 29:02.011
for the rest of our lives.

29:02.012 --> 29:05.181
The whole world will be looking for us.

29:05.182 --> 29:06.816
This is something between you and him.

29:06.817 --> 29:09.085
It's got nothing to do with me.

29:14.724 --> 29:16.858
Hey, hey, don't do it. Don't do it.

29:16.859 --> 29:18.193
You calling the shots now?

29:18.194 --> 29:20.262
No, man.

29:20.263 --> 29:21.897
It's a trap.

29:26.803 --> 29:28.737
Yeah, I see him.

29:34.177 --> 29:36.545
Where are you?

29:36.546 --> 29:38.846
I can almost smell you.

29:43.286 --> 29:45.287
Let's get out of here.

29:45.288 --> 29:47.121
Let's get on with the plan.

29:50.926 --> 29:53.093
Don't do it.

30:06.208 --> 30:07.575
That's them! Take the shot!

30:07.576 --> 30:08.843
No clear hit, sir.

30:08.844 --> 30:10.745
Damn it!

30:10.746 --> 30:13.815
Silver SUV heading
east past the boatyard.

30:13.816 --> 30:15.483
Can any unit apprehend?

30:15.484 --> 30:17.251
Someone get eyes on that plate?

30:17.252 --> 30:19.788
Car 14 responding.
Can you repeat location?

30:19.789 --> 30:23.256
Heading southeast past
Western Avenue boatyard.

30:23.257 --> 30:25.258
They're probably halfway to the moon!

30:32.433 --> 30:34.067
Where do you think you're going?

30:34.068 --> 30:35.669
You're not here to let me out?

30:35.670 --> 30:37.737
No. Close it.

30:40.608 --> 30:43.081
Look, Cat's lame-ass
lectures don't make me talk.

30:43.082 --> 30:45.412
- This won't either.
- You can save the wannabe act, okay?

30:45.413 --> 30:48.235
I know how much you
mean to Cat, so I'm here

30:48.236 --> 30:52.206
one last time to try
to get through to you.

30:52.207 --> 30:54.775
We have security footage
of you from the prison.

30:54.776 --> 30:56.709
That package that you handed the guard?

30:56.710 --> 30:58.979
You know what was in it?

30:58.980 --> 31:01.315
The parts they used to make the zip gun.

31:01.316 --> 31:03.850
The gun they used in their escape.

31:03.851 --> 31:05.252
You're just trying to scare me.

31:05.253 --> 31:07.388
No, if I was trying to
scare you, I'd tell you

31:07.389 --> 31:10.524
that that guard gave you up
the moment he saw the video.

31:10.525 --> 31:13.211
And that when they try you as an adult,

31:13.212 --> 31:16.315
you're gonna be locked up for
longer than you've been alive.

31:16.316 --> 31:18.050
I... I don't... I don't
think that's how it works.

31:18.051 --> 31:19.818
Where are they?

31:19.819 --> 31:22.585
Come on, Petra, give
me something to trade

31:22.586 --> 31:24.222
so I can help you.

31:24.223 --> 31:27.958
I'm 16. You shouldn't be
talking to me without a lawyer.

31:44.877 --> 31:47.445
- Cat Chambers...
- The manhunt is on with

31:47.446 --> 31:49.447
confirmed sightings of Doug O'Casey...

31:49.448 --> 31:51.649
- Trained mercenaries...
- The leader of

31:51.650 --> 31:53.284
- the Shorepound Syndicate...
- We go live to

31:53.285 --> 31:55.024
a news conference for further updates.

31:55.025 --> 31:58.022
Thank you all for coming.

31:58.023 --> 32:00.724
While I will always be
grateful to Cat Chambers

32:00.725 --> 32:03.627
for saving my life and
ending that terrible ordeal,

32:03.628 --> 32:06.429
neither I nor any member
of the Eastland family

32:06.430 --> 32:07.931
condone her actions today.

32:07.932 --> 32:10.166
I will personally be here for Cat,

32:10.167 --> 32:13.470
right here, if she
has a change of heart.

32:13.471 --> 32:16.740
Please, Cat, before
it's too late, come home.

32:16.741 --> 32:18.909
Let's face this together.

32:20.444 --> 32:22.112
Can you tell us anything more about...

32:32.423 --> 32:35.524
Wait here. I'll just be a few minutes.

32:36.994 --> 32:38.395
Tori?

32:38.396 --> 32:39.829
Daddy!

32:39.830 --> 32:42.032
Would you like a drink?

32:42.033 --> 32:43.933
Tori, I have no idea

32:43.934 --> 32:46.657
what you're up to this time,
but we need to go right now.

32:46.658 --> 32:48.058
This is my house, Father.

32:48.059 --> 32:49.627
I'm not having this discussion now.

32:49.628 --> 32:51.562
This place is a crime
scene waiting to happen.

32:51.563 --> 32:54.130
Ooh, that sounds exciting.

32:56.601 --> 33:00.771
Haven't you embarrassed
this family enough?

33:00.772 --> 33:03.607
You think so little of me.
You always have.

33:03.608 --> 33:05.842
Tori, listen to me.

33:05.843 --> 33:08.912
You're putting your life
in danger just being here.

33:08.913 --> 33:11.548
You have no idea who
these individuals are

33:11.549 --> 33:13.749
that Cat Chambers broke
out of jail this morning.

33:13.750 --> 33:15.951
Why don't you run it down for us?

33:15.952 --> 33:17.686
Tori is a good listener.

33:22.493 --> 33:24.194
I'm afraid your driver and bodyguard

33:24.195 --> 33:25.727
are a little under the weather.

33:30.367 --> 33:33.570
You have no idea what you just did.

33:33.571 --> 33:35.305
Sure she does.

33:35.306 --> 33:36.872
And the sooner you get over it,

33:36.873 --> 33:38.908
the sooner we can get down to business.

33:54.811 --> 33:56.077
Anything at the farmhouse?

33:56.078 --> 33:57.646
Still waiting on forensics, but...

33:57.647 --> 33:59.281
Keep digging. First 24 hours...

33:59.282 --> 34:01.340
On it, Chief.

34:07.976 --> 34:08.976
Cole.

34:08.976 --> 34:10.577
Hey. It's me.

34:10.578 --> 34:12.411
I need to see you.

34:12.413 --> 34:13.648
Yes, ma'am.

34:13.649 --> 34:15.315
And what would that address be again?

34:17.318 --> 34:18.719
Minister Bob.

34:18.719 --> 34:20.121
The orphanage.

34:35.536 --> 34:38.906
So, what do you want?

34:38.907 --> 34:41.175
Let's start with what
you're gonna pay me tonight.

34:41.176 --> 34:42.275
For what?

34:42.277 --> 34:43.743
For saving you from a violent death

34:43.744 --> 34:45.342
at the hands of my associate.

34:53.253 --> 34:56.121
$3 million, I walk away free.

34:56.123 --> 34:59.826
Or $60 million wired
to this bank account

34:59.827 --> 35:02.062
in the Cayman islands.

35:02.063 --> 35:04.564
And new passports.

35:04.565 --> 35:06.032
And the use of your plane

35:06.033 --> 35:08.835
to get the hell off this
island once and for all.

35:08.836 --> 35:11.337
And how much of this
does my daughter get?

35:11.338 --> 35:12.972
Oh, you would be proud of me, Dad.

35:12.973 --> 35:15.675
I negotiated a full share for myself.

35:15.676 --> 35:17.875
You sure about that?

35:23.382 --> 35:25.150
I suckered him here for you.

35:25.151 --> 35:26.752
Should've read the
fine print, sweetheart.

35:26.753 --> 35:29.587
If I don't get paid,
I'm going to the cops.

35:35.228 --> 35:37.129
Hey, hey, hey.

35:37.130 --> 35:38.563
Okay, okay.

35:38.564 --> 35:40.232
Sit down.

35:40.233 --> 35:41.599
It's okay.

35:43.103 --> 35:44.902
Alright, alright.

35:49.342 --> 35:52.142
Mr. O'Casey is in charge here.

36:06.391 --> 36:09.127
Permission to board?

36:09.128 --> 36:11.929
I do believe that you outrank
me, Lieutenant Governor.

36:18.971 --> 36:21.906
What kind of stunt
did you pull today, hm?

36:21.907 --> 36:24.008
Jake the Human Target?

36:24.009 --> 36:25.408
He was here.

36:25.409 --> 36:26.977
We had him in our sights.

36:26.978 --> 36:28.811
We blew it.

36:30.414 --> 36:32.115
We have to flip Cat's narrative.

36:32.116 --> 36:33.383
Yeah.

36:33.384 --> 36:36.486
Cat in cuffs wouldn't be great
for the Governor, now, would it?

36:36.487 --> 36:37.687
If it comes out now

36:37.688 --> 36:40.823
that she's been working
for him under the table, no.

36:42.059 --> 36:44.527
It's best if Cat simply disappears.

36:44.528 --> 36:46.462
Whoa. I don't like how that sounds.

36:46.463 --> 36:49.131
That's not what I'm
asking, and you know it.

36:50.768 --> 36:51.768
What do you want?

36:51.769 --> 36:52.969
Jake...

36:57.441 --> 37:00.510
We both know you can't
give me what I want.

37:39.349 --> 37:40.682
Hey.

37:42.552 --> 37:43.652
Are you okay?

37:43.653 --> 37:46.120
Well, define "okay".

37:46.121 --> 37:49.224
Cat, you are in some
serious trouble this time.

37:49.225 --> 37:51.660
I mean, you got to come
in, tell your story,

37:51.661 --> 37:53.395
- tell them what really happened.
- No, I'm not coming in.

37:53.396 --> 37:55.864
No one's gonna believe
what really happened.

37:55.865 --> 37:57.932
Yeah, they want to buy into Doug O'Casey

37:57.933 --> 38:01.069
and Cat Chambers reunited,
criminal lovers on the run.

38:01.070 --> 38:02.371
That's the story they're selling,

38:02.372 --> 38:04.439
and everyone's buying into it.

38:04.440 --> 38:06.307
I'm not.

38:06.308 --> 38:09.010
Well, good, because it's not true.

38:09.011 --> 38:11.379
Okay. I believe you.

38:11.380 --> 38:12.480
Now what?

38:12.481 --> 38:14.148
I got to go.

38:14.149 --> 38:18.086
But I need your help getting
out of here in one piece.

38:18.087 --> 38:19.586
Come on.

38:23.759 --> 38:25.026
Where are you going?

38:25.027 --> 38:27.428
It's better if you don't know.

38:28.530 --> 38:30.598
- Oh.
- Must have followed me.

38:30.599 --> 38:34.869
I just wanted to see your
face and say goodbye in person.

38:34.870 --> 38:36.704
Cat Chambers, we have you surrounded.

38:36.705 --> 38:39.873
Come out with your hands
raised above your head.

38:41.710 --> 38:42.809
Go, go, go.

38:42.810 --> 38:44.077
Hurry, hurry.

38:44.078 --> 38:46.678
- You're advised to...
- Be careful.

38:47.815 --> 38:50.117
Detective Cole...

38:52.253 --> 38:54.472
Come out with your hands up.

38:54.473 --> 38:55.797
Suspect surrounded.

38:55.798 --> 38:58.191
Hey, Bob, we're making it.

39:02.263 --> 39:03.830
We know she's inside.

39:03.831 --> 39:05.132
I can bring her out.

39:05.133 --> 39:06.934
I can't trust you.

39:06.935 --> 39:08.501
Not when it comes to her.

39:08.502 --> 39:11.171
Come on, there are children in there.

39:11.172 --> 39:12.572
Give me two minutes.

39:12.573 --> 39:14.707
You have the place surrounded.
Where could she possibly go?

39:14.708 --> 39:16.476
Please, think of the kids.

39:16.477 --> 39:19.278
You mean like you did when you
decided to harbor a fugitive?

39:19.279 --> 39:21.514
Kristy...

39:21.515 --> 39:22.981
Sergeant Ellis...

39:31.492 --> 39:33.660
You got two minutes.

39:33.661 --> 39:35.226
Thank you.

39:36.964 --> 39:39.231
Cat? It's me.

39:39.232 --> 39:40.967
I'm coming in alone.

40:20.873 --> 40:21.907
Let's go.

40:21.908 --> 40:24.274
Hey, let's go.

40:25.443 --> 40:26.511
I have your word.

40:26.512 --> 40:28.412
You have my word when we find Cat.

40:28.413 --> 40:29.680
That wasn't the deal.

40:29.681 --> 40:30.815
That's my deal.

40:30.816 --> 40:32.683
I'm not leaving without her.

41:22.733 --> 41:24.533
Are you sure about this?

41:26.771 --> 41:29.573
No turning back now.

41:29.574 --> 41:31.140
Right.

41:31.141 --> 41:33.777
No turning back.
