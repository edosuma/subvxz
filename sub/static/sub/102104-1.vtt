00:00.627 --> 00:02.545
(upbeat music)

00:24.108 --> 00:24.983
- [Caller 1] Hey, Kellar.

00:25.025 --> 00:25.818
What's happening?

00:25.860 --> 00:26.985
- [Kellar] Hey partner.

00:27.027 --> 00:27.737
You got the evidence?

00:27.778 --> 00:28.278
- Do I have the evidence?

00:28.320 --> 00:29.697
Are you kidding?

00:29.738 --> 00:32.950
If I did, I would have brought
it in by now, you crazy.

00:32.992 --> 00:33.952
Yeah, word is,

00:35.077 --> 00:38.247

of this seed,

00:38.288 --> 00:40.082

00:40.123 --> 00:41.542
(Indistinct)

00:41.583 --> 00:46.380
Yeah, what I heard was there
was some girl (Indistinct)

00:46.422 --> 00:47.380
- [Keller] Really.

00:47.422 --> 00:49.842
- I'd love to get my
hands on it.

00:49.883 --> 00:53.303
All I heard was that it
looks kind of

00:53.345 --> 00:55.180
like what you might
find on a floor

00:55.222 --> 00:58.058
of a small foggy I don't know.

00:58.100 --> 01:02.772
Anyway, I'm not gonna be
coming in for a couple days.

01:02.813 --> 01:03.647
- [Kellar] You got
vacation or is it,

01:03.688 --> 01:06.025
your annual Gonorrhea shut time.

01:06.067 --> 01:07.483
- No it's my dog okay?

01:07.525 --> 01:11.030
I think she's got
scurvy or something.

01:11.072 --> 01:12.072
- [Kellar] Okay.

01:12.113 --> 01:13.407
- Anyway, I'll talk
to you later.

01:13.448 --> 01:14.242
- [Kellar] All right bye.

01:14.283 --> 01:15.118
- See you.

01:24.168 --> 01:25.920
- Money or the stuff.

01:27.755 --> 01:28.880
- I don't have the money.

01:28.922 --> 01:29.882
I don't have the stuff
but I do have...

01:29.923 --> 01:30.715
- What?

01:30.757 --> 01:31.883
- I got an explanation.

01:31.925 --> 01:34.928
- No no no no no explanation.

01:34.970 --> 01:38.140
9ine told me to shoot
you in the head.

01:38.182 --> 01:40.100
- 9ine tells you to do a
lot of things.

01:40.142 --> 01:42.853
If he told you to jump off
a bridge, would you do it?

01:42.895 --> 01:46.315
No you wouldn't
please hear me out,

01:46.357 --> 01:47.482
I've got an explanation.

01:47.523 --> 01:49.443
I think you're gonna like this.

01:49.485 --> 01:51.445
- No explanations, no anything.

01:51.487 --> 01:53.405
Money or the stuff right now.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.157
- Hear what I've got to say,

01:55.198 --> 01:57.868
you're gonna understand why
it's gonna be worth the wait.

01:57.910 --> 01:58.993
- Right now.

01:59.035 --> 02:01.163
- I need you to wait one
or two more days.

02:01.205 --> 02:04.000
Everything's gonna be okay,
alright?

02:04.042 --> 02:04.958
- Not alright.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.085
Not alright at all.

02:06.127 --> 02:09.337
- Look, let me tell 9ine myself.

02:09.378 --> 02:11.798
Let me just explain to
him what's going on.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.133
Alright?

02:13.175 --> 02:15.343
- You can explain it to him now.

02:15.385 --> 02:18.013
- Oh, hey 9ine how's it going?

02:18.055 --> 02:19.432
Good to see you.

02:19.473 --> 02:22.100
Look, We were just
talking about,

02:22.142 --> 02:24.645
what we were talking about.

02:24.687 --> 02:25.855
You understand.

02:26.897 --> 02:27.773
There's an explanation.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.440
- Where is my stuff?

02:29.482 --> 02:31.443
- Okay there is the money
and there is the stuff.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.362
And there is actually
two explanations.

02:33.403 --> 02:34.822
One for the money,

02:35.865 --> 02:37.573
(man chokes)

02:37.615 --> 02:42.203
- I thought you wanted me
to shoot him in the head?

02:42.245 --> 02:44.665
Go ahead shot him in the head.

- They weren't

11:45.247 --> 11:49.877

rehab (mumbles) open up,

11:50.418 --> 11:52.797
(indistinct)

11:54.588 --> 11:56.465
- They shop for rehab (mumbles)?

11:56.507 --> 11:59.428
- Sort of what happens
all the time.

12:02.973 --> 12:03.807
- Hey siz

12:05.183 --> 12:05.768
- Hey KK

12:06.893 --> 12:08.770

sister with her bag.

12:08.812 --> 12:12.315
Take her bag upstairs
I'm sure she's tired.

12:20.032 --> 12:21.200
- Here let me.

12:25.203 --> 12:28.123
- Thanks (mumbles)

12:38.048 --> 12:43.055
It has actually been a
while since I've been here.

12:43.097 --> 12:46.017
- (mumbles) the same.

12:47.392 --> 12:51.980
You know you don't have
to keep stuff bottled in.

12:52.022 --> 12:54.148
- Keep what bottled in.

12:54.190 --> 12:55.192
- I know you.

13:01.488 --> 13:04.785
- Ever since you left
I've been feeling,

13:07.412 --> 13:09.582
I don't know empty inside.

13:13.125 --> 13:15.170
It's hard keep planting
up some kinda (mumbles).

13:15.212 --> 13:17.715
- I just had to get outta here.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.595
- I felt like you
left me behind.

13:24.220 --> 13:26.807
You taught me a lot about life.

13:28.182 --> 13:31.228
But never anything
about abandonment.

13:40.570 --> 13:42.072
I had to watch mum

13:44.615 --> 13:48.703
(mumbles) like she was a zombie.

13:51.580 --> 13:54.167
I always hoped I really thought

13:56.210 --> 13:58.880
it could get better after rehab.

14:00.465 --> 14:03.885
- I'm sorry if it makes
you feel any better.

14:03.927 --> 14:07.430
The military was not
sunshine and rainbows.

14:08.682 --> 14:11.852
- I can tell you're
hiding things too.

14:23.653 --> 14:27.910
- So this is the type of
stuff you're watching now?

14:38.462 --> 14:40.255
Let me show something.

14:45.302 --> 14:47.888
I want you to punch in my head.

27:28.397 --> 27:30.773

But never anything
about abandonment.

28:18.530 --> 28:20.115
- Yes it's she.

28:20.157 --> 28:22.702
- I just called to make
sure you knew

28:22.743 --> 28:25.495
what really happened
to your sister.

28:25.537 --> 28:27.915
The detectives wanted
me to keep things quiet.

28:27.957 --> 28:29.165
- Quiet?

28:29.207 --> 28:31.252
- It's a new drug that
hit the streets a couple

28:31.293 --> 28:33.922
of months ago called seed.

28:33.963 --> 28:35.005
- What?

28:35.047 --> 28:36.757
- I've seen drug mules
coming through

28:36.798 --> 28:39.133
with blue all in their system.

28:39.175 --> 28:42.888
And your sister, hers
was the same way.

28:42.930 --> 28:44.557
- She was a drug mule?

28:44.598 --> 28:47.558
- No, your sister was beaten

28:47.600 --> 28:51.480
and someone forcibly made
her swallow the drugs.

28:51.522 --> 28:53.982
- The cops wanted to
keep it quiet?

28:54.023 --> 28:55.067
- There are some things
you should know

28:55.108 --> 28:57.693
about this city, Ms. Camden.

28:57.735 --> 28:59.738
There are a lot of people
who wanna keep things

28:59.780 --> 29:01.198
in the status quo.

29:02.658 --> 29:03.660
- Thank you.

29:25.972 --> 29:28.808
- Our condolences go
out to Kenya's family.

29:28.850 --> 29:31.395
Who are grieving from the
loss of losing,

29:31.437 --> 29:35.440
not only their mother,
but to lose a daughter

29:35.482 --> 29:37.777
and a sister as well.

29:37.818 --> 29:40.070
When will this violence end?

29:41.655 --> 29:45.493
When will we rise up and
put our faith in God?

29:48.662 --> 29:50.998
Kenya will not be forgotten.

29:52.375 --> 29:53.543
Brother Jacks.

30:02.092 --> 30:06.347
- Church we're here to
mourn yet another lost soul.

30:10.683 --> 30:14.605
Kenya Camden was not only
a friend of my family

30:17.482 --> 30:20.653
the friend of our
congregation family, okay?

30:22.070 --> 30:26.408
Brother Camden and Sidney
and Sarah have been coming

30:28.035 --> 30:30.663
to the church here for
over 25 years.

30:32.080 --> 30:36.418
And yet just last week we
laid to rest mother Camden

30:38.253 --> 30:40.423
and now they placed Kenya.

30:46.970 --> 30:48.723
Our hearts are heavy.

30:50.098 --> 30:52.727
There's a lot of pain and agony.

30:57.313 --> 30:59.317
Church we feel defeated.

31:01.108 --> 31:05.615
We feel like we can't
accomplish the goal of survival.

31:09.075 --> 31:11.078
How do we overcome that?

31:13.788 --> 31:18.543
What can we do to save the
lives that are remaining here?

31:24.217 --> 31:25.510

31:28.262 --> 31:30.432
Wake up we cannot continue

31:35.018 --> 31:37.272

31:40.565 --> 31:45.447
There's a whole community of
people out there that need us.

31:47.113 --> 31:48.865
And this tragedy,

31:48.907 --> 31:52.328
this family, the loss of
another loved one

31:53.787 --> 31:55.790
will not go unforgotten.

32:00.168 --> 32:03.588
- Oh my God, Sarah,

32:03.630 --> 32:04.507

I can't stay here.

Are you ready?

32:18.853 --> 32:20.857
- Yes I'm ready let's go.

32:24.527 --> 32:26.862
So do the police have any leads?

32:26.903 --> 32:27.905
- [Sarah] No they ain't talking.

32:27.947 --> 32:29.280
They don't say a lot.

32:29.322 --> 32:31.325
I'm willing to bet that
Bloodbornes were involved.

32:31.367 --> 32:32.785
- [Sidney] You know
that for sure?

32:32.827 --> 32:33.993
- [Sarah] Gut feeling.

32:34.035 --> 32:35.453
- [Sidney] Are you asking
any questions?

32:35.495 --> 32:36.955
- [Sarah] I don't know
where to start.

32:36.997 --> 32:39.625
- [Sidney] That looks like
a good place to start, stop.

32:39.667 --> 32:40.835
- [Sarah] What?

32:42.377 --> 32:44.003
- I'm going to ask a
couple of questions.

32:44.045 --> 32:46.548
Somebody somewhere, knows
something in this streets.

32:46.590 --> 32:48.342
- You'll miss your flight aunty.

32:48.383 --> 32:50.260
- Relax I'll make it quick.

32:50.302 --> 32:52.303
- That's a dangerous place.

32:52.345 --> 32:53.472
- What could I do?

32:53.513 --> 32:54.848
I'm just the woman.

32:54.890 --> 32:57.227
(jazz music)

33:15.243 --> 33:18.955
Can you tell me who is the
leader of the Bloodbornes?

33:18.997 --> 33:20.748
- What you want for
little momma?

33:20.790 --> 33:22.208
- I'm not your momma.

33:22.250 --> 33:25.920
- Now which one of you is
the leader of the Bloodbornes

33:25.962 --> 33:27.172

- Don't hit women.

34:06.170 --> 34:08.588
(jazz music)

34:31.987 --> 34:35.490
You better tell me where
your leader is,

34:35.532 --> 34:38.618
or we could start this
thing all over again.

34:38.660 --> 34:39.828
- He ain't here

34:44.250 --> 34:46.668
(jazz music)

34:59.472 --> 35:01.725
- Tell him Sidney was here.

35:14.822 --> 35:16.365
- Did you get any information?

35:16.407 --> 35:17.992
- Not really let's go.

like you want with all this

44:28.500 --> 44:30.085
heavy artillery.

44:30.127 --> 44:31.795
- City's full of rats

44:32.670 --> 44:34.713
- Space too big (mumbles)

44:34.755 --> 44:35.840
- Fucking huge

44:37.633 --> 44:39.302
- You're starting a war.

44:39.343 --> 44:42.222
- The war's already started.

44:42.263 --> 44:44.933
(dramatic music)

45:06.747 --> 45:09.248
(door knocks)

45:10.458 --> 45:11.293

Pilgrim with us today.

45:54.002 --> 45:56.837
- Of course it's
great to be here.

45:56.878 --> 45:59.298
You know, as mayor of
King city, any opportunity

45:59.340 --> 46:00.548
I get to brag

46:00.590 --> 46:03.427
about my city and the
great things we're doing

46:03.468 --> 46:05.637
I'm more than happy to do so.

46:05.678 --> 46:10.433
- So tell us a little bit
about what you do for our city.

46:10.475 --> 46:14.688
We hear so much but I wanna
hear the truth from you.

46:14.730 --> 46:19.152
- Well, I mean, we've got a
lot of civic projects going on.

46:19.193 --> 46:20.820
A lot of inclusiveness.

46:20.862 --> 46:25.115
We're always looking to
honor all of our people

46:25.157 --> 46:27.243
all the diversity that
we have that we're proud

46:27.285 --> 46:29.663
of in King city, infrastructure,

46:31.163 --> 46:34.500
King city's on the rise, we're
happy to be a part of it.

46:34.542 --> 46:35.793
- So I hear that

46:37.293 --> 46:41.132
you know, about gang
Bloodbornes, the Bloodbornes?

46:42.467 --> 46:46.095
- Right we are aware of
the, the bloodbornes,

46:46.137 --> 46:47.388
we're aware of this new drug

46:47.430 --> 46:49.348
the seed that they're pushing.

46:49.390 --> 46:54.145
And we're constantly trying
to take it out of distribution

46:55.603 --> 47:00.400
and hold people accountable
that they're pushing it.

47:00.442 --> 47:04.155
- You're out there in the
city, you must be talking

47:04.197 --> 47:07.617
to them, you know have
some kind of relationship.

47:07.658 --> 47:11.287
- So we have no ties or
affiliations with the

47:11.328 --> 47:12.372
Bloodbornes.

47:14.123 --> 47:15.708
I am aware of them.

47:15.750 --> 47:18.378
I have had concerned
citizens come to us,

47:19.920 --> 47:23.633
about even the deaths that
have occurred because of that.

47:23.675 --> 47:25.092
- [Jessica] Yeah.

47:25.133 --> 47:30.140
- I've worked with people
that are concerned, citizens,

47:30.182 --> 47:30.765
some with like

47:32.182 --> 47:36.313
well, I mean, for instance,
Ricardo White, who has

47:39.398 --> 47:43.612
funds available to help
us try and eliminate this.

47:43.653 --> 47:45.445
And he's a concerned person

47:45.487 --> 47:49.200
citizen who is aiding us
in finding the resources

47:49.242 --> 47:50.492
to do something (mumbles)

47:50.533 --> 47:54.122
What is your affiliation
with Ricardo White?

47:55.998 --> 48:00.420
= Well, the truth is that
people will push a narrative.

48:00.462 --> 48:01.672
And the truth is,

48:01.713 --> 48:02.463
- Yeah

48:02.505 --> 48:03.922
- If you let a rumor run,

48:03.963 --> 48:08.720
it will run rampant that
you're not gonna get the truth.

48:08.762 --> 48:09.887
When you're gonna

48:09.928 --> 48:11.805
- I think it's a little
more than that.

48:11.847 --> 48:14.392
- So they're just rumors
and if you're trying to...

48:14.433 --> 48:16.477
- [Host] Come on (mumbles)
calm down you don't have...

48:16.518 --> 48:20.230
- No I think maybe you
need to calm down.

48:20.272 --> 48:22.817
My daughter's been
kidnapped by probably

48:22.858 --> 48:25.653
this exact same people who have

48:25.695 --> 48:27.280
my beautiful daughter Jennifer.

48:27.322 --> 48:29.657
And I am a victim of
this myself.

48:29.698 --> 48:30.992
- Oh we have a call.

48:31.033 --> 48:32.785
- [Sarah] A 14 year old
little girl was killed.

48:32.827 --> 48:35.705
She was my sister, what
are you gonna do about it?

48:35.747 --> 48:37.957
- Caller what is your name?

48:37.998 --> 48:40.000
- [Sarah] My name is Sarah.

48:40.042 --> 48:42.212
- Sarah, do you know Sarah?

48:43.837 --> 48:47.008
- I don't Sarah, I'm
sorry for your loss.

48:48.300 --> 48:52.012
Like I just shared my
family also is dealing

48:52.053 --> 48:56.602
with a kidnapping involved
with this and the death of any

48:57.518 --> 49:00.022
of my people I take personally

49:01.647 --> 49:03.690
what am I going to do about it?

49:03.732 --> 49:05.483
I tell you what I'm
gonna do about it.

49:05.525 --> 49:07.318
As soon as this is over
I'll go straight down

49:07.360 --> 49:12.200
to the police station and I
will just push them to do more.

49:13.660 --> 49:15.578
I get in their face.

49:15.620 --> 49:18.497
(phone rings)

49:18.538 --> 49:19.748
- Yeah what do you want?

49:19.790 --> 49:21.042
- A cigar roll,

49:21.083 --> 49:23.795
- (mumbles) you know
what I'm saying?

49:23.837 --> 49:27.048
- I need something like a boom

49:27.090 --> 49:30.008

49:30.050 --> 49:32.720
- Look someone's on my
security (mumbles)

hour after that customer.

49:37.183 --> 49:39.937
Got it? (mumbles)

49:42.147 --> 49:43.815
You'll have to wait.

49:48.277 --> 49:50.822
Might wanna be seeing you soon.

49:50.863 --> 49:52.865
- Get me some protection
for my daughter.

49:52.907 --> 49:55.327
Something small and dangerous.

50:00.748 --> 50:01.750
- Dangerous.

50:05.670 --> 50:06.503
- There's an eagle.

50:06.545 --> 50:07.380
- That's right.

50:07.422 --> 50:10.173
What the hell do you punks want?

50:10.215 --> 50:14.137
- See you see (mumbles)

54:09.622 --> 54:12.332

54:12.373 --> 54:15.420
- They had like racks

54:20.048 --> 54:21.133
- In this factory this is where

54:21.175 --> 54:23.512

54:29.392 --> 54:30.477
That's funny.
