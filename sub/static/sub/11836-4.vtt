WEBVTT

00:01.568 --> 00:02.335
DOLE: Previously
on "The Practice"...

00:02.368 --> 00:04.505
WALSH:
I've reviewed your plea offer.

00:04.538 --> 00:06.339
It's rejected.
Why?

00:06.372 --> 00:07.808
WALSH:
Because your wife committed

00:07.841 --> 00:09.342
first-degree murder.

00:09.375 --> 00:11.311
This just came through the fax.

00:11.344 --> 00:13.446
FRUTT:
It is an internal memorandum,

00:13.479 --> 00:16.049
which says the victim
was likely moving

00:16.082 --> 00:17.784
towards Lindsay Dole.

00:17.818 --> 00:19.485
It's work product.
It's exculpatory.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.588
WALSH: It's part
of our internal investigation.

00:21.622 --> 00:22.689
It's work product.

00:22.723 --> 00:24.691
You gave them that report.

00:24.725 --> 00:27.327
It was about giving defense
a document

00:27.360 --> 00:28.695
they're entitled to have.

00:28.729 --> 00:31.131
Why didn't you at least
have the integrity

00:31.164 --> 00:32.799
to be upfront about it?

00:32.833 --> 00:34.535
Before you add me
to a list of people

00:34.568 --> 00:36.837
that are out to get you,

00:36.870 --> 00:38.238
when I started here,

00:38.271 --> 00:40.173
I wanted to be you.

00:40.206 --> 00:42.375
WEST: I find your misconduct

00:42.408 --> 00:44.578
to be deliberate, egregious,

00:44.611 --> 00:46.146
and outrageous.

00:46.179 --> 00:49.716
I am dismissing the indictment
with prejudice.

00:49.750 --> 00:52.553
The defendant
is to be released immediately.

00:52.586 --> 00:53.920
DOLE: Take me home.

01:06.272 --> 01:07.941
Am I wrong?

01:07.974 --> 01:10.376
Tell me if I'm wrong.
You're not wrong.

01:10.410 --> 01:12.913
I certainly don't wanna force
their hand, but--

01:12.946 --> 01:13.914
Let's go.

01:17.918 --> 01:19.052
Sorry to keep you.

01:23.957 --> 01:25.058
Listen.

01:25.091 --> 01:26.292
For many reasons we feel,

01:26.326 --> 01:28.294
and we feel strongly,

01:28.328 --> 01:30.130
we should plead guilty

01:30.163 --> 01:32.933
to manslaughter.
What?

01:32.966 --> 01:35.168
YOUNG: Roland,
they have a strong case.

01:35.201 --> 01:37.203
Our defense,
our entire defense,

01:37.237 --> 01:38.805
is predicated
on religious freedom,

01:38.839 --> 01:42.776
which at this moment
in time

01:42.809 --> 01:46.046
has become one of our less
precious civil liberties.

01:46.079 --> 01:47.413
If you read
the newspapers, you...

01:47.447 --> 01:48.448
We don't.

01:48.481 --> 01:50.150
Well, if you would,

01:50.183 --> 01:51.685
you'd get a pretty good gauge

01:51.718 --> 01:52.819
on the public's reaction.

01:52.853 --> 01:54.721
We don't care
with the public things.

01:54.755 --> 01:56.790
YOUNG: To the extent,
it reflects the attitude

01:56.823 --> 01:58.091
of your peers.

01:58.124 --> 01:59.192
You need to care.

01:59.225 --> 02:00.967
Twelve members of the public

02:01.001 --> 02:02.969
will be sitting
in that jury box.

02:03.003 --> 02:04.437
The layperson is outraged

02:04.470 --> 02:06.472
that you didn't take
your son to a hospital.

02:06.507 --> 02:09.375
John Q. has no use
for Christian Science

02:09.408 --> 02:12.546
other than to train his dog
with your newspaper.

02:12.579 --> 02:16.149
Roland,
you picked a bad time

02:16.182 --> 02:19.352
to let somebody die
in the name of a God.

02:23.356 --> 02:25.125
And it is our united view

02:25.158 --> 02:27.661
that if we push this to trial,

02:27.694 --> 02:30.731
both of you could go
to prison for life.

02:32.065 --> 02:33.900
DONNELL:
You're both decent people.

02:33.934 --> 02:35.001
We don't question you.

02:35.035 --> 02:38.905
We know you did what you
believed would save Peter.

02:38.939 --> 02:41.842
But you will lose at trial.

02:44.044 --> 02:46.312
We need to take the deal.

02:53.319 --> 02:54.287
Okay.

02:58.892 --> 03:03.403
(music playing)

03:48.615 --> 03:50.517
The public's not
gonna be happy with a plea,

03:50.551 --> 03:53.019
I'll tell you that.
It's "pound of flesh" time.

03:53.053 --> 03:54.588
You think the public's
gonna be disappointed?

03:54.621 --> 03:56.657
Try Helen. She's been biting
the furniture

03:56.690 --> 03:57.991
getting ready for this one.

04:05.839 --> 04:06.773
Hello.

04:08.542 --> 04:10.243
Hi.
Hey.

04:10.276 --> 04:13.313
WASHINGTON: I thought you
weren't coming back.

04:13.346 --> 04:14.414
So soon.

04:15.682 --> 04:17.216
Well, uh--

04:18.584 --> 04:19.519
hi.

04:19.553 --> 04:20.521
Hi.

04:20.553 --> 04:21.721
Jamie Stringer.

04:21.755 --> 04:23.857
I'm a big fan of yours.

04:23.890 --> 04:26.727
I'm so totally at your desk.
Let me move.

04:26.760 --> 04:28.228
Congratulations
on being cleared.

04:28.261 --> 04:29.763
It was so overdue.

04:29.796 --> 04:31.231
Actually, I wasn't cleared.

04:31.264 --> 04:34.033
I got out on a technicality,
but thank you.

04:34.067 --> 04:36.369
I am so totally
at your desk.

04:36.402 --> 04:37.303
(glass breaks)

04:40.674 --> 04:41.942
What the--

04:48.048 --> 04:49.816
Pat, are you all right?

04:49.850 --> 04:51.552
If you want something,
go around.

05:01.535 --> 05:03.169
First of all,
what's going on?

05:03.203 --> 05:04.270
Are you leaving?

05:04.304 --> 05:05.371
I'm done.

05:05.405 --> 05:06.507
Retiring.

05:06.540 --> 05:08.074
You're retiring?

05:08.108 --> 05:09.710
I can't make the rent.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.177
I'm being evicted.

05:11.845 --> 05:12.946
Did you throw this?

05:12.979 --> 05:14.114
That's mine.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.082
Yeah. It came through
our window.

05:16.116 --> 05:17.818
I must have overshot the box.

05:17.851 --> 05:19.285
FRUTT: Overshot it?

05:19.319 --> 05:21.354
It sailed halfway
into our office.

05:21.387 --> 05:22.723
Sorry.

05:29.129 --> 05:31.364
And the plea of manslaughter
is acceptable

05:31.397 --> 05:33.033
to the Commonwealth?

05:33.066 --> 05:35.101
Yes, Your Honor,
with a joint recommendation

05:35.135 --> 05:37.671
for a six-year sentence
starting immediately

05:37.704 --> 05:39.773
upon the entering
of the verdicts.

05:39.806 --> 05:42.308
KITTLESON: Mr. and Mrs. Hubert,
please rise.

05:44.611 --> 05:46.446
Mr. Hubert, do you understand

05:46.479 --> 05:47.648
that you are pleading guilty

05:47.681 --> 05:49.983
to the charge of voluntary
manslaughter?

05:50.016 --> 05:51.017
Yes, Your Honor.

05:51.051 --> 05:52.118
KITTLESON: And by doing so,

05:52.152 --> 05:53.754
you are acknowledging guilt

05:53.787 --> 05:55.589
and criminal responsibility

05:55.622 --> 05:57.323
for the death of your son?

06:02.969 --> 06:05.539
Mr. Hubert,
I asked you a question.

06:05.572 --> 06:09.109
Do you acknowledge
your guilt and responsibility

06:09.142 --> 06:11.044
in the death of your son?

06:13.379 --> 06:15.281
God took my son, Your Honor.

06:15.315 --> 06:17.183
We did everything
we could to save him.

06:18.218 --> 06:19.485
KITTLESON:
If that's how you feel,

06:19.520 --> 06:22.422
why, sir,
are you pleading guilty?

06:22.455 --> 06:24.825
Because counsel
has advised us to.

06:24.858 --> 06:28.494
KITTLESON: Mrs. Hubert, do you
also maintain your innocence?

06:28.529 --> 06:30.764
Yes, Your Honor.

06:30.797 --> 06:32.498
The plea bargain is rejected.

06:32.533 --> 06:34.535
Trial will begin tomorrow
morning, 9:00 a. m.

06:34.568 --> 06:36.236
We're adjourned.
(gavel bangs)

06:36.269 --> 06:37.337
DONNELL: Chambers, Your Honor.

06:37.370 --> 06:38.505
Do you dare?

06:38.539 --> 06:40.073
Chambers.

06:41.074 --> 06:42.609
WENDY: Oh.
YOUNG: Are you okay?

06:42.643 --> 06:45.378
(inhales deeply)

06:45.411 --> 06:46.613
I'm fine.

06:49.315 --> 06:51.417
A client can choose
to plead guilty

06:51.451 --> 06:53.520
even while maintaining
innocence.

06:53.554 --> 06:54.855
Not with me, he can't.
DONNELL: Oh, come on.

06:54.888 --> 06:57.257
Ninety percent of all pleas
are based on an analysis

06:57.290 --> 06:58.358
of winning percentages.

06:58.391 --> 07:00.433
They have nothing to do
with actual merits.

07:00.466 --> 07:02.368
I don't accept guilty pleas

07:02.402 --> 07:04.037
from people claiming innocence.

07:04.070 --> 07:05.371
To do so would be a farce.

07:05.405 --> 07:07.073
YOUNG: Our clients
have a right to negotiate

07:07.107 --> 07:08.875
down from a murder-two
conviction.

07:08.909 --> 07:10.143
Every defendant has that right.

07:10.176 --> 07:11.845
KITTLESON:
Eugene, I realized

07:11.878 --> 07:13.980
that nine out
of ten judges would go along,

07:14.014 --> 07:15.215
but I don't.

07:15.248 --> 07:17.317
If somebody
says they're innocent,

07:17.350 --> 07:20.220
I don't let them
come stand in my courtroom

07:20.253 --> 07:21.788
and declare guilt
for the purpose

07:21.822 --> 07:23.590
of improving disposition.

07:23.624 --> 07:24.658
It's a mockery.

07:26.259 --> 07:28.529
The trial starts tomorrow.

07:30.731 --> 07:32.733
Try to get over your
disappointment, Helen.

07:35.802 --> 07:37.437
Of course, you're happy.

07:37.470 --> 07:38.805
Plea bargains suck.

07:38.839 --> 07:41.575
It's like a tie game,
nobody wins.

07:41.608 --> 07:43.877
The Japanese, they don't
believe in compromise.

07:43.910 --> 07:46.446
No such thing as win-win
for the Japs.

07:46.479 --> 07:47.914
There can be no victory

07:47.948 --> 07:50.116
unless the other guy loses.

07:50.150 --> 07:52.085
You know,
that sounds racist.

07:52.118 --> 07:53.787
Oh, come on.
Isn't that some hypocrisy?

07:53.820 --> 07:55.589
It's okay to call
Jewish women J.A.Ps

07:55.622 --> 07:57.524
but we can't call Japs Japs?

07:57.558 --> 07:59.626
Well, it's not okay to refer

07:59.660 --> 08:01.868
to Jewish women as J.A.Ps.

08:01.902 --> 08:05.038
And I'm becoming increasingly
concerned about you.

08:05.071 --> 08:06.306
Is that why you're here?

08:06.339 --> 08:08.308
To tell me
that you're worried?

08:10.176 --> 08:10.911
(sighs)

08:10.944 --> 08:13.547
Actually, no.

08:15.448 --> 08:18.384
I'm worried about
Mrs. Hubert's unborn child.

08:18.418 --> 08:20.286
She had a contraction
in the courtroom today.

08:20.320 --> 08:22.488
She's almost eight months.

08:22.523 --> 08:24.691
Her first child
was born a month early.

08:24.725 --> 08:26.159
There were complications.

08:26.192 --> 08:28.361
They didn't go to the hospital.

08:28.394 --> 08:30.964
Little boy almost died
of asphyxiation.

08:30.997 --> 08:32.298
You know this how?

08:32.332 --> 08:34.134
Well, I learned it
during my investigation.

08:34.167 --> 08:37.370
Is there a way we can
protect this fetus?

08:37.403 --> 08:40.373
We have no jurisdiction
over an unborn.

08:41.407 --> 08:42.775
What about social services?

08:42.808 --> 08:44.077
WALSH: Uh,
they don't have it either.

08:44.110 --> 08:45.178
It's been tried.

08:45.211 --> 08:47.648
You can thank your women's
rights groups for that.

08:47.681 --> 08:50.450
We've prosecuted women for
killing their unborn fetuses,

08:50.483 --> 08:51.752
so can't we make
the argument,

08:51.785 --> 08:53.186
if a fetus is a person,

08:53.219 --> 08:54.555
for the purpose
of charging murder--

08:54.588 --> 08:56.022
It won't fly.

08:56.056 --> 08:58.091
I need you to think
of something.

08:58.124 --> 09:00.366
That baby could be in danger.

09:03.504 --> 09:05.672
Try a Section 12.

09:06.339 --> 09:09.676
You put a hold on the mother
on psychiatric grounds.

09:09.710 --> 09:12.779
You put an end around
the constitution.

09:12.813 --> 09:15.649
The courts are much more
predisposed to say yes there,

09:15.682 --> 09:17.483
especially,
if you have the right judge.

09:20.120 --> 09:21.354
I'll do it.

09:22.055 --> 09:23.223
What do you mean you'll do it?

09:23.256 --> 09:24.390
WALSH: I mean I'll do it.

09:24.424 --> 09:25.391
It's a bit of a sell.

09:25.425 --> 09:27.160
It'll mean more
if the Divisional Chief

09:27.193 --> 09:28.795
himself appears in court.

09:28.829 --> 09:30.396
I don't think
that's a good idea.

09:30.430 --> 09:31.598
Why?

09:31.632 --> 09:32.566
Well, uh...

09:32.599 --> 09:34.835
I think you might
be leaping at the chance

09:34.868 --> 09:36.837
to take on this firm again.

09:36.870 --> 09:38.572
After losing Lindsay Dole--

09:38.605 --> 09:39.973
WALSH: Nonsense.

09:40.006 --> 09:41.742
I'm driven by the merits
of the case.

09:41.775 --> 09:44.410
It's time we start protecting
the unborn children.

09:44.444 --> 09:47.280
This is a person, eight months.

09:47.313 --> 09:49.249
It's viable. It's a life.

09:49.282 --> 09:52.285
And to say it doesn't
have any vested rights

09:52.318 --> 09:53.887
because it hasn't
been delivered,

09:53.920 --> 09:56.189
all the while,
the delivery itself

09:56.222 --> 09:58.559
is being jeopardized,
it's insane.

09:58.892 --> 10:00.400
This case is ripe.

10:00.433 --> 10:01.401
It's important.

10:01.434 --> 10:04.805
It needs to be made
forcefully and publicly.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.272
I'll do it.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.121
This is not a stunt.

10:21.154 --> 10:22.856
Come on, Helen.
You take her into custody,

10:22.889 --> 10:24.190
how does that not prejudice
the jury?

10:24.224 --> 10:26.059
The jury is sequestered,
butt-nuts,

10:26.092 --> 10:27.427
they won't have to know.

10:27.460 --> 10:28.461
Mr. Walsh.

10:28.494 --> 10:29.429
Did he call me "butt-nuts"?

10:29.462 --> 10:31.532
GAMBLE:
Look, we have a viable baby

10:31.565 --> 10:32.533
in potential danger.

10:32.566 --> 10:34.067
The law is clear.

10:34.100 --> 10:36.603
They cannot assert
their religious rights.

10:36.637 --> 10:37.470
Where's the danger?

10:37.504 --> 10:39.105
Premature delivery
like her last child,

10:39.139 --> 10:41.608
who almost died from
having an umbilical cord--

10:41.642 --> 10:42.543
That hardly gives
you grounds.

10:42.576 --> 10:44.477
These wackos
won't go to doctors.

10:44.511 --> 10:46.713
KITTLESON: Mr. Walsh,
that is quite enough.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.049
GAMBLE: Your Honor,
it makes the most sense

10:49.082 --> 10:51.184
to simply delay
the criminal trial

10:51.217 --> 10:53.153
until after she gives birth.
That way--

10:53.186 --> 10:54.487
DONNELL: It makes
no sense to do that,

10:54.521 --> 10:55.589
given there's no basis

10:55.622 --> 10:57.658
to take Wendy Hubert
into custody.

10:57.691 --> 10:59.359
Section 12, Chapter 123.

10:59.392 --> 11:00.226
Read the law.

11:00.260 --> 11:01.502
Or are you against
that on principle?

11:01.535 --> 11:02.836
You're gonna lecture me
on rules?

11:02.869 --> 11:04.771
KITTLESON:
Both of you, shut up.

11:04.805 --> 11:07.608
There will be no further
delay of this trial.

11:07.641 --> 11:09.009
We start this morning.

11:09.610 --> 11:12.078
Mr. Walsh, if you think you
can make a Section 12 showing,

11:12.112 --> 11:14.014
you're going to have to take it
before another judge.

11:14.047 --> 11:15.982
I want the proceedings sealed.

11:16.316 --> 11:18.552
If you get your order,
come back to me,

11:18.585 --> 11:20.086
and I'll figure out a way
to impose it

11:20.120 --> 11:22.055
without prejudicing the trial.

11:22.088 --> 11:24.490
Do any public yapping,

11:24.525 --> 11:26.126
and I will declare a mistrial

11:26.159 --> 11:27.961
and hold you in contempt.

11:28.428 --> 11:31.464
It would be a mistake to regard
that as judicial bluster.

11:31.497 --> 11:32.966
This is ridiculous.

11:32.999 --> 11:34.801
GAMBLE: Eugene,
a child's life is in danger.

11:34.835 --> 11:36.503
YOUNG: That child's not
in danger, Helen.

11:36.537 --> 11:37.403
This has nothing to do
with that child.

11:37.437 --> 11:38.705
GAMBLE: Oh, what are you
a doctor now?

11:38.739 --> 11:40.006
KITTLESON: I've heard enough.

11:40.040 --> 11:41.174
In to court.

11:41.207 --> 11:42.275
Let's go.

11:43.577 --> 11:46.112
All right. I'm on my way.

11:46.146 --> 11:48.048
Walsh is going to a separate
court to get Wendy

11:48.081 --> 11:49.215
held on a Section 12.

11:49.249 --> 11:50.416
WASHINGTON: What?
How?

11:50.450 --> 11:51.718
FRUTT: It's a ploy
to get her in custody

11:51.752 --> 11:53.019
until the baby's born.

11:53.053 --> 11:54.888
Jamie, I need some research.
You're coming with me.

11:54.921 --> 11:56.022
Excellent.
FRUTT: Bring your computer.

11:56.056 --> 11:57.658
Make sure it's charged.
We'll get on Westlaw in the cab.

11:57.691 --> 11:58.358
STRINGER: Right.

11:58.391 --> 11:59.392
FRUTT: Come on.

11:59.425 --> 12:01.434
Start with Section 12,
Chapter 123,

12:01.467 --> 12:03.604
emergency restraint
of dangerous persons.

12:06.740 --> 12:08.308
Lindsay, what are you doing?

12:09.710 --> 12:10.944
Just sitting.

12:10.977 --> 12:12.546
I got good at it in prison.

12:13.514 --> 12:15.215
Is everything okay?

12:15.248 --> 12:17.050
Fine.

12:17.083 --> 12:18.184
I'm fine.

12:19.953 --> 12:20.821
Okay.

12:22.155 --> 12:23.123
Come on.

12:25.225 --> 12:27.961
There's a huge adjustment
to being on the outside again.

12:27.994 --> 12:30.564
She's been in jail
a month, Jaime.

12:30.597 --> 12:31.632
STRINGER: I'm just saying.

12:31.665 --> 12:33.233
FRUTT: Get on the computer.

12:33.266 --> 12:34.300
Right.

12:45.045 --> 12:48.982
(music playing)

13:07.173 --> 13:08.341
(sighs)

13:25.926 --> 13:27.360
DOCTOR:
The official cause of death

13:27.393 --> 13:29.462
was adult respiratory
distress syndrome,

13:29.495 --> 13:31.197
ARDS for short.

13:31.231 --> 13:34.601
Although this was a child,
the diagnosis is the same.

13:34.635 --> 13:37.203
It was brought on
by the hantavirus.

13:37.237 --> 13:41.041
Doctor, could you explain
this hantavirus to the jury?

13:41.074 --> 13:43.777
DOCTOR: Basically,
it's a virus found in rodents,

13:43.810 --> 13:45.278
which when exposed to humans

13:45.311 --> 13:46.847
can attack the lungs.

13:46.880 --> 13:48.715
GAMBLE:
How are humans exposed?

13:48.749 --> 13:51.017
DOCTOR: Most of the time
through the saliva, urine,

13:51.051 --> 13:52.519
or feces of the rodent.

13:52.553 --> 13:55.656
If Peter touched a dead mouse
or a dead rat,

13:55.689 --> 13:56.657
that could have done it.

13:56.690 --> 13:58.859
Or he could
have simply inhaled dust

13:58.892 --> 14:02.202
that contained dried rodent
urine or feces.

14:02.235 --> 14:04.771
We don't know exactly
how he was exposed.

14:04.805 --> 14:06.306
But you're sure he was?

14:06.339 --> 14:07.541
Absolutely.

14:07.574 --> 14:10.511
The autopsy concluded
that was the cause of death.

14:10.544 --> 14:13.947
GAMBLE: Doctor,
would he have had any symptoms?

14:13.980 --> 14:15.015
DOCTOR: Acute.

14:15.048 --> 14:16.650
They would
have started flu-like,

14:16.683 --> 14:18.885
uh, fever, coughing,
headaches.

14:18.919 --> 14:20.954
Then progressively
gotten worse,

14:20.987 --> 14:23.189
muscle aches,
breathing problems,

14:23.223 --> 14:25.058
lungs filling with fluid.

14:25.091 --> 14:27.060
This boy was in a lot
of distress

14:27.093 --> 14:28.995
and died a very painful death.

14:29.029 --> 14:30.531
Objection. Speculation.

14:30.564 --> 14:31.798
Sustained.

14:31.832 --> 14:34.635
GAMBLE: Doctor,
is there medical treatment

14:34.668 --> 14:36.570
that could have saved Peter?

14:36.603 --> 14:39.405
DOCTOR: Oxygen therapy,
antiviral drugs, fluids.

14:39.439 --> 14:41.441
If he'd been taken
to a doctor immediately,

14:41.474 --> 14:42.375
he wouldn't be dead--

14:42.408 --> 14:43.577
Objection.

14:43.610 --> 14:45.078
DOCTOR: --in my opinion.

14:45.111 --> 14:46.813
I'll allow it.

14:46.847 --> 14:48.815
Thank you. That's all.

14:53.887 --> 14:55.922
So medical care could have saved

14:55.956 --> 14:57.023
this boy's life?

14:57.057 --> 14:59.492
You can state that
to a medical certainty?

14:59.526 --> 15:00.366
Probability.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.434
DONNELL: Probability.

15:01.467 --> 15:03.236
How probable, Doctor?

15:03.269 --> 15:05.606
I can state it
to a substantial likelihood.

15:05.639 --> 15:07.340
DONNELL: Really?
You must be quite a doctor.

15:07.373 --> 15:09.810
Do you mean if Peter Hubert
had come to you personally--

15:09.843 --> 15:10.744
This is badgering.

15:10.777 --> 15:12.312
I apologize.

15:12.345 --> 15:14.548
How many diagnosed cases
have there been

15:14.581 --> 15:17.417
of the hantavirus
in the last 10 years, Doctor?

15:17.450 --> 15:22.422
Since 1993,
we've had 326 diagnosed.

15:22.455 --> 15:24.791
Of those cases,
how many have died?

15:24.825 --> 15:26.226
One hundred twenty-two.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.594
DONNELL: One hundred
and twenty-two.

15:27.628 --> 15:30.531
Of those 122 cases,

15:30.564 --> 15:32.699
how many have sought
medical help?

15:32.733 --> 15:33.700
Most.
DONNELL: Most.

15:33.734 --> 15:36.770
And yet 122 people have died.

15:36.803 --> 15:38.839
Doctor, isn't it possible
Peter Hubert

15:38.872 --> 15:40.073
also might have died,

15:40.106 --> 15:42.442
even if he had gotten
medical attention?

15:42.475 --> 15:43.810
Possible, but with early--

15:43.844 --> 15:45.078
DONNELL: Thank you, doctor.

15:45.111 --> 15:46.312
You answered my question.

15:51.084 --> 15:53.186
WALSH: There is ample authority
for the Commonwealth

15:53.219 --> 15:54.487
to hold a pregnant mother.

15:54.521 --> 15:56.557
SWACKHEIM: I didn't ask you
for authority.

15:56.590 --> 15:58.592
I said tell me why
she's a nutcase.

15:58.625 --> 15:59.560
I would submit, Your Honor,

15:59.593 --> 16:02.068
any woman who exposes
her child to danger,

16:02.102 --> 16:04.137
potentially fatal danger,

16:04.170 --> 16:06.239
the benign assessment
would be nutcase.

16:06.272 --> 16:07.641
No. He's saying there
is a presumption

16:07.674 --> 16:10.644
of psychiatric infirmity
for any Christian Scientist.

16:10.677 --> 16:12.746
I am not saying that.
You most certainly are.

16:12.779 --> 16:14.881
Don't be putting
statements into my mouth.

16:14.915 --> 16:17.784
I certainly am capable
of spewing my own nonsense.

16:17.818 --> 16:20.987
Your Honor, this woman is
currently on trial for murder.

16:21.021 --> 16:23.089
I don't think it's presumptive
of me to have doubts.

16:23.123 --> 16:24.324
SWACKHEIM: Yes, it is, counsel.

16:24.357 --> 16:26.126
She hasn't been convicted.

16:26.159 --> 16:28.829
The presumption,
then, is one of innocence.

16:28.862 --> 16:30.296
Remember that one?

16:30.330 --> 16:32.933
WALSH: That would be
her constitutional right.

16:32.966 --> 16:35.869
I am before you today
on the rights of the child.

16:35.902 --> 16:37.303
There is no burden
on the court

16:37.337 --> 16:39.840
when weighing the best
interest of the child

16:39.873 --> 16:42.042
to constitutionally
safeguard the mother.

16:42.075 --> 16:44.878
Are we supposed to let this
baby die, and then say,

16:44.911 --> 16:47.981
"Hey, but at least we didn't
trample the civil liberties

16:48.014 --> 16:49.583
of mommy dearest"?

16:49.616 --> 16:51.852
That's crap, and I'll say so.

16:51.885 --> 16:54.555
Nobody is saying
"Forget about the child."

16:54.588 --> 16:57.423
We are just asking,
how is it in danger?

16:57.457 --> 16:59.325
WALSH: By being
in the womb of a woman

16:59.359 --> 17:01.401
who won't get medical help.

17:01.434 --> 17:04.069
Her last delivery almost
resulted in death.

17:04.104 --> 17:07.240
He survived only to die
three years later

17:07.272 --> 17:09.710
from the fumes of a dead rat,

17:09.742 --> 17:12.646
which this mother didn't do
a damn thing about.

17:12.679 --> 17:16.215
She has a history
of complications at birth.

17:16.249 --> 17:17.317
She's having contractions.

17:17.349 --> 17:19.185
She has a history
of doing nothing

17:19.219 --> 17:22.656
when her kids are facing
life-threatening dangers.

17:22.689 --> 17:25.592
(keyboard clicking)

17:32.833 --> 17:34.200
(door opens)

17:34.234 --> 17:35.301
HATCHER: (sighs)

17:35.335 --> 17:38.271
You guys, could you come
with me a second?

17:48.982 --> 17:51.351
Lindsay, what's going on?

17:51.384 --> 17:53.587
Oh, I just got this table
out of storage.

17:53.620 --> 17:56.489
I just thought I'd sit here
while I get used to being back.

17:56.523 --> 17:57.958
I'm kind of enjoying the quiet.

17:59.092 --> 17:59.993
Oh.

18:01.067 --> 18:02.235
Okay.

18:06.072 --> 18:07.641
He looked terrible.

18:07.674 --> 18:09.109
He would get dizzy.

18:09.142 --> 18:10.544
He would vomit.

18:10.577 --> 18:12.412
He had excruciating
headaches.

18:12.445 --> 18:14.515
GAMBLE: How often
did you have occasion

18:14.548 --> 18:16.049
to see Peter Hubert?

18:16.082 --> 18:17.518
LISA: At first
I saw him a lot.

18:17.551 --> 18:19.252
I was an invited guest.

18:19.285 --> 18:20.654
Wendy and I were good friends.

18:20.687 --> 18:21.788
You're next door neighbors?

18:21.822 --> 18:23.389
LISA: Yes.

18:23.423 --> 18:25.025
But the more I implored her
to take the child

18:25.058 --> 18:26.159
to the hospital,

18:26.192 --> 18:27.761
the more estranged we became,

18:27.794 --> 18:30.163
to the point where
I wasn't invited.

18:30.196 --> 18:32.065
GAMBLE: At what point
during his illness

18:32.098 --> 18:34.234
did this estrangement
take place?

18:34.267 --> 18:35.602
LISA: It was building.

18:35.636 --> 18:38.138
But when I called
the ambulance myself,

18:38.171 --> 18:39.439
that was pretty much it.

18:39.472 --> 18:41.575
I wasn't invited
into the house anymore.

18:41.608 --> 18:43.176
You called an ambulance?

18:43.209 --> 18:43.910
LISA: Yes.

18:43.944 --> 18:45.478
I couldn't take it.

18:45.512 --> 18:47.313
He looked like
he was going to die.

18:47.347 --> 18:49.315
Did an ambulance come?

18:49.349 --> 18:50.684
LISA: Yes.

18:50.717 --> 18:52.152
And they sent him away
saying that

18:52.185 --> 18:54.387
it was a false alarm.

18:54.420 --> 18:56.557
About two weeks after that,

18:56.590 --> 18:57.691
Peter did die.

18:59.526 --> 19:01.301
During the course
of Peter's illness,

19:01.334 --> 19:02.335
did you witness his parents

19:02.368 --> 19:03.670
doing anything about it?

19:03.704 --> 19:05.138
They would pray.

19:05.171 --> 19:07.107
Lots and lots of praying.

19:07.140 --> 19:08.074
YOUNG: Just the two of them?

19:08.108 --> 19:09.810
LISA: No. Sometimes people
would come over,

19:09.843 --> 19:10.877
group prayings.

19:10.911 --> 19:12.245
YOUNG: And during the illness,

19:12.278 --> 19:15.215
did it ever appear Peter's
condition was improving?

19:15.248 --> 19:17.117
LISA: A couple of times
the symptoms

19:17.150 --> 19:18.785
seemed to subside,

19:18.819 --> 19:20.286
but then they would return.

19:20.320 --> 19:21.722
YOUNG: So they prayed
and things,

19:21.755 --> 19:23.957
at least temporarily,
got better.

19:23.990 --> 19:25.892
Did that happened,
what, once or twice?

19:25.926 --> 19:27.761
Well, I don't think
they really did get better.

19:27.794 --> 19:29.730
YOUNG: It just seemed so?

19:29.763 --> 19:30.797
Yes.

19:30.831 --> 19:32.699
You were good friends
with Wendy Hubert?

19:32.733 --> 19:33.734
LISA: Yes.

19:33.767 --> 19:35.368
YOUNG: Was she a loving mother?

19:35.401 --> 19:36.336
I thought so, yes.

19:36.369 --> 19:38.805
YOUNG: At any time,
did you ever question

19:38.839 --> 19:39.873
her love for Peter?

19:39.906 --> 19:41.207
No.

19:41.241 --> 19:42.108
YOUNG: Did you ever
have occassion

19:42.142 --> 19:43.710
to question Roland's love
for his son?

19:43.744 --> 19:44.745
LISA: No.

19:44.778 --> 19:46.112
As you observed them praying

19:46.146 --> 19:47.848
and praying and praying

19:47.881 --> 19:49.616
for their son's recovery,

19:49.650 --> 19:51.985
you regarded these prayers
as heartfelt?

19:52.018 --> 19:53.086
Of course.

19:53.119 --> 19:54.721
YOUNG: After Peter's passing,

19:54.755 --> 19:56.923
did you ever have occasion
to meet with the Huberts?

19:56.957 --> 19:59.159
LISA: Yes. I went to them
with my sympathy.

19:59.192 --> 20:01.835
So you had an opportunity
to observe their reaction

20:01.868 --> 20:03.003
to Peter's death?

20:03.036 --> 20:05.506
I saw them after,
like I said.

20:05.539 --> 20:07.140
YOUNG: How would you describe
their reaction

20:07.173 --> 20:08.875
to Peter's death?

20:08.909 --> 20:10.844
They were devastated.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.345
What parent wouldn't be?

20:14.781 --> 20:16.349
YOUNG: Thank you, Ms. Astin.

20:30.163 --> 20:32.265
WALSH: I've never seen
Swackheim deliberate this long

20:32.298 --> 20:34.200
over a decision.

20:34.234 --> 20:35.902
Truth is...

20:35.936 --> 20:37.671
I never figured he
gave any thought at all

20:37.704 --> 20:39.139
to his rulings.

20:39.172 --> 20:42.275
I thought he just flipped
a coin, the lazy hack.

20:45.378 --> 20:47.581
Why did you come after me
with all the personal attacks

20:47.614 --> 20:50.551
in the Dole case, Ellenor?

20:50.584 --> 20:51.952
I wanna know.

20:51.985 --> 20:54.154
Part of it was strategy.

20:54.187 --> 20:57.791
Part of it was your antics
truly offended me.

20:57.824 --> 20:59.626
Don't you regard
your behavior toward me

20:59.660 --> 21:01.201
as slightly vicious?

21:02.102 --> 21:03.036
Maybe.

21:05.271 --> 21:06.907
I went to see a shrink.

21:06.940 --> 21:07.908
You know what he told me?

21:07.941 --> 21:10.176
I could be sexually
frustrated.

21:10.911 --> 21:12.979
Why is it shrinks
are all Freudian,

21:13.013 --> 21:16.149
sex-obsessed,
depraved perverts?

21:16.182 --> 21:18.051
They think everything is sex.

21:21.354 --> 21:22.856
How often you get laid?

21:22.889 --> 21:25.859
Big-boned girl,
can't be too often.

21:25.892 --> 21:26.993
You, on the other hand,

21:27.027 --> 21:28.595
you probably rent rooms
by the hour.

21:28.629 --> 21:31.231
Little tramps coming out
of law school these days.

21:31.264 --> 21:32.098
Look at you.

21:32.132 --> 21:35.101
Cherubic little sperm magnet.

21:35.135 --> 21:37.738
Did you just call me cherubic?

21:37.771 --> 21:38.705
Jamie...

21:40.741 --> 21:44.444
ROLAND: He had a fever,
but he'd had fevers in the past.

21:44.477 --> 21:46.847
Our course of treatment
had always been prayer,

21:46.880 --> 21:48.481
cold compacts.

21:48.515 --> 21:51.484
These treatments had proved
to be successful in the past.

21:51.518 --> 21:53.019
When you say many--

21:53.053 --> 21:55.656
Five, six
over his three years.

21:55.689 --> 21:57.157
He also had strep before,

21:57.190 --> 21:59.292
conjunctivitis,
many illnesses

21:59.325 --> 22:02.603
which we treated successfully
with prayer.

22:02.636 --> 22:04.270
We thought we would be
successful here.

22:04.304 --> 22:06.339
DONNELL: But, Mr. Hubert,
when Peter started

22:06.372 --> 22:07.608
having trouble breathing...

22:07.641 --> 22:09.242
We responded with more
intensive treatment.

22:09.275 --> 22:10.310
Which was?

22:10.343 --> 22:11.812
Prayer.

22:11.845 --> 22:13.413
This is our faith,
Mr. Donnell.

22:13.446 --> 22:14.948
DONNELL: I understand.
But, Mr. Hubert,

22:14.981 --> 22:16.282
a lot of people
are wondering

22:16.316 --> 22:18.585
how a father could just
let his son die.

22:18.619 --> 22:21.087
I didn't just
let him die.

22:21.121 --> 22:23.524
My wife and I did everything
we could to help him heal.

22:23.557 --> 22:26.126
We did what we believed
would help him get better.

22:26.159 --> 22:27.761
We did not sit idly.

22:27.794 --> 22:29.630
We did not let my son die.

22:29.663 --> 22:31.064
Why not pray
in the waiting room

22:31.097 --> 22:32.999
while a doctor
treated your son?

22:33.033 --> 22:35.435
Because taking him
for medical treatment would not,

22:35.468 --> 22:36.670
in our view, heal him,

22:36.703 --> 22:38.038
and we wanted him
to recover.

22:38.071 --> 22:39.806
I'm asking
hard questions, sir,

22:39.840 --> 22:41.542
because this jury
would like to know

22:41.575 --> 22:43.677
how any loving father
could just turn his back

22:43.710 --> 22:45.579
on medical assistance

22:45.612 --> 22:47.681
which has been proven
to work.

22:50.483 --> 22:53.954
ROLAND: Every one of us
draws the line somewhere.

22:53.987 --> 22:57.257
Most people think artificial
life-saving devices go too far,

22:57.290 --> 22:59.459
and they execute living wills
to prohibit them.

23:00.060 --> 23:01.267
Sixty years ago,

23:01.301 --> 23:03.169
people considered
transplanting organs

23:03.203 --> 23:05.706
to be ungodly and perverse.

23:05.739 --> 23:08.308
Now the line has moved.

23:08.341 --> 23:09.876
People are okay
with it today.

23:09.910 --> 23:11.945
Today, stem cell research

23:11.978 --> 23:14.147
is considered horrific,

23:14.180 --> 23:16.049
totally against God
and humanity.

23:16.082 --> 23:19.853
But as the arguments are made
how it can save lives,

23:19.886 --> 23:22.255
well, the line of acceptability
is about to move again.

23:22.288 --> 23:25.759
Likelihood is people
will eventually embrace

23:25.792 --> 23:27.594
some form of human cloning,

23:27.628 --> 23:30.230
because as long as
there is a life to be saved,

23:30.263 --> 23:31.865
how can you say no to it?

23:31.898 --> 23:33.099
Well, Christian Scientists

23:33.133 --> 23:35.502
are simply unwilling
to move the line.

23:35.536 --> 23:38.872
Unwilling to adjust our faith
to keep up with the times.

23:38.905 --> 23:41.742
Uh, there will always be new
medicines, new technologies,

23:41.775 --> 23:44.110
new devices,
and inventions.

23:44.144 --> 23:45.345
That doesn't change
the fact

23:45.378 --> 23:48.181
that we consider this world
to be a spiritual one.

23:48.214 --> 23:50.083
And that both
sin and illness

23:50.116 --> 23:51.451
can only be overcome

23:51.484 --> 23:53.687
by spiritual power.

23:53.720 --> 23:56.256
And since I believed
divine healing

23:56.289 --> 23:58.559
to be my son's best chance
at survival,

23:58.592 --> 24:00.400
I felt the most
reasonable thing

24:00.433 --> 24:03.236
that I could do
was turn to it.

24:08.575 --> 24:10.310
So while many of us
draw the line

24:10.343 --> 24:13.714
at stem cell research
and cloning,

24:13.747 --> 24:16.883
you draw it
at 106 temperature.

24:18.752 --> 24:21.922
Mr. Hubert, did you go
to an ophthalmologist

24:21.955 --> 24:22.923
to get your glasses?

24:22.956 --> 24:24.758
We don't consider
that medicine.

24:24.791 --> 24:25.926
According to my records,

24:25.959 --> 24:28.094
you also visited a dentist
last summer.

24:28.128 --> 24:30.463
Again, we consider that aid,
not medicine.

24:30.496 --> 24:33.333
GAMBLE: In fact, you went
during your son's illness.

24:33.366 --> 24:36.102
My faith allows for aid
from a dentist.

24:36.136 --> 24:37.538
It doesn't
medical treatment.

24:37.571 --> 24:38.539
I explained that,

24:38.572 --> 24:40.473
and I object
to the ridicule.

24:42.876 --> 24:45.512
Do you think I came here today
to ridicule you?

24:45.546 --> 24:46.780
You think there's a judge
up there,

24:46.813 --> 24:48.549
a jury over here,

24:48.582 --> 24:51.151
all gathered
to ridicule you, sir?

24:51.852 --> 24:53.820
This is a murder trial,
Mr. Hubert.

24:53.854 --> 24:55.689
A boy is dead.
My boy.

24:55.722 --> 24:57.524
You say that as if
you were his parent.

24:57.558 --> 24:58.825
ROLAND: I was his parent.
GAMBLE: And you think

24:58.859 --> 25:00.667
it's prejudice
to hold parenting

25:00.701 --> 25:03.136
up to the standards
of reasonableness?

25:03.737 --> 25:05.138
Because that's what
this is about, Mr. Hubert.

25:05.171 --> 25:07.508
I don't care
what God you believe in.

25:07.541 --> 25:09.075
You were vested
with the care

25:09.109 --> 25:11.745
of a very sick
three-year-old little boy,

25:11.778 --> 25:12.846
and you let him die.

25:12.879 --> 25:13.647
I did not.
DONNELL: Objection.

25:13.680 --> 25:15.616
GAMBLE: Yes, you did.
Objection.

25:15.649 --> 25:18.184
GAMBLE: Withdrawn.
Who gave you the right

25:18.218 --> 25:21.021
to exalt religion here
at the expense--

25:21.054 --> 25:22.222
You'd find that
in the constitution, counsel.

25:22.255 --> 25:24.157
And does one have to read
the constitution

25:24.190 --> 25:26.359
in order to be
protected by it?

25:26.392 --> 25:27.661
What about
the three-year-olds

25:27.694 --> 25:29.730
who cannot sound out
the words yet?

25:29.763 --> 25:31.865
Did Peter have any rights,
Mr. Hubert?

25:31.898 --> 25:34.535
Peter understood the basic
principles of our faith.

25:34.568 --> 25:36.002
GAMBLE: Is it your testimony

25:36.036 --> 25:38.872
that your son
made an informed,

25:38.905 --> 25:40.340
competent decision

25:40.373 --> 25:42.308
not to go to the hospital

25:42.342 --> 25:44.578
as he lay dying in agony?

25:44.611 --> 25:46.246
Obviously,
I made the choice.

25:46.279 --> 25:47.413
GAMBLE: Yes, you made it.

25:47.447 --> 25:48.915
And what part
of the constitution would you--

25:48.949 --> 25:50.383
I was his guardian.

25:50.416 --> 25:53.086
GAMBLE: Yes, you were
his guardian, Mr. Hubert.

25:53.119 --> 25:55.556
For God's sake,
you were his guardian,

25:55.589 --> 25:57.390
and you simply let him die.

25:57.423 --> 25:58.692
I did not.

26:00.601 --> 26:02.468
Oh, right.

26:02.503 --> 26:03.870
You prayed.

26:05.171 --> 26:07.407
Here's a flash,
Mr. Hubert.

26:08.174 --> 26:09.776
We all pray.

26:26.927 --> 26:29.195
I haven't seen
any evidence

26:29.229 --> 26:31.431
that Mrs. Hubert
is a dangerous person,

26:31.464 --> 26:33.366
other than
Mr. Walsh's assumption

26:33.399 --> 26:35.168
that she's guilty
of the charges

26:35.201 --> 26:37.103
for which she hasn't yet
been convicted.

26:37.638 --> 26:39.139
The Commonwealth's
petition...

26:39.172 --> 26:40.373
is denied.

26:41.274 --> 26:43.009
Just like that?

26:43.043 --> 26:44.911
Uh, what do you want,
a preamble?

26:46.446 --> 26:48.081
Could I be heard,
Your Honor?

26:50.651 --> 26:54.054
Every day on my job,

26:54.087 --> 26:56.557
I battle
civil rights activists

26:56.590 --> 26:59.292
who bemoan the erosion
of the Fourth Amendment,

26:59.325 --> 27:02.736
who fight for the murderer's
right to counsel.

27:02.769 --> 27:04.370
You know who
I'm talking about.

27:04.404 --> 27:06.740
All those
Liberal pufferfish

27:06.773 --> 27:08.509
who are protesting
the death penalty

27:08.542 --> 27:10.110
while they cling
to a woman's right

27:10.143 --> 27:11.244
to have an abortion

27:11.277 --> 27:13.614
like it's an inalienable
American right,

27:13.647 --> 27:14.715
and I'm sick of it.

27:14.748 --> 27:18.318
Who the hell is sticking up
for this unborn person?

27:18.351 --> 27:19.620
He's eight months old.

27:19.653 --> 27:20.854
He's viable.

27:20.887 --> 27:23.456
And yet we say
he doesn't exist

27:23.489 --> 27:25.592
for the purpose
of being protected

27:25.626 --> 27:27.060
because he hasn't
passed through

27:27.093 --> 27:28.662
the great vaginal gateway

27:28.695 --> 27:30.997
like it's
the Holland Tunnel.

27:31.031 --> 27:32.198
Where in God's name

27:32.232 --> 27:34.200
are all the pro-lifers today

27:34.234 --> 27:37.470
sticking up
for this little life?

27:37.504 --> 27:39.205
Why is this room empty,
I ask?

27:39.239 --> 27:41.241
Because the proceeding
is sealed.

27:41.274 --> 27:42.275
Anything else?

27:42.308 --> 27:44.511
We fight for the rights
of the accused,

27:44.545 --> 27:45.779
the right to abort,

27:45.812 --> 27:48.081
the right to exercise
religion and free speech,

27:48.114 --> 27:50.717
but we don't fight
for human life?

27:52.252 --> 27:53.820
We're like little bugs,

27:53.854 --> 27:55.689
ants, cockroaches.

27:55.722 --> 27:57.157
We're no better
than the little vermin

27:57.190 --> 27:59.225
running around
on our kitchen floor.

27:59.259 --> 28:02.869
We should just wipe the earth
clean of mankind.

28:08.842 --> 28:11.678
Motion to rid mankind denied.

28:12.613 --> 28:14.014
We're adjourned.

28:34.234 --> 28:36.570
Kenneth, clearly,
I don't like you.

28:37.638 --> 28:38.939
But I have always,

28:38.972 --> 28:41.374
always considered you
a legal talent

28:41.407 --> 28:43.777
and an extremely
formidable foe.

28:45.145 --> 28:46.346
But now,

28:47.714 --> 28:49.449
Kenneth,
you need to get some help.

28:51.351 --> 28:52.719
You're rambling on

28:52.753 --> 28:55.088
like an evangelist
on Coke.

28:55.121 --> 28:57.323
Whether
it's a vacation...

28:57.357 --> 28:59.259
Are you sexually
attracted to me?

29:02.368 --> 29:04.304
No, I'm not.

29:04.871 --> 29:06.439
I didn't think so,

29:06.472 --> 29:09.009
but the shrink threw it out,
so I thought I'd ask.

29:10.711 --> 29:13.714
Women never are,
you know,

29:13.747 --> 29:14.915
attracted to me.

29:16.717 --> 29:18.752
See sperm magnet
over there?

29:20.086 --> 29:21.655
Not in my wildest dreams.

29:21.688 --> 29:23.857
Kenneth,
you need to take a break.

29:25.659 --> 29:26.660
Maybe.

29:28.128 --> 29:29.630
I am tired.

29:32.666 --> 29:34.968
Uh, I seem
to be tired a lot.

29:41.307 --> 29:42.643
I'm tired.

30:07.641 --> 30:08.975
(knocks on door)

30:09.009 --> 30:10.677
(door opens)

30:10.711 --> 30:11.678
All set?

30:13.313 --> 30:14.480
Bobby,

30:15.682 --> 30:17.584
I wanna start
my own practice.

30:19.586 --> 30:20.486
(sighs)

30:20.521 --> 30:21.588
Excuse me?

30:21.622 --> 30:23.156
DOLE: I can rent
this office,

30:23.189 --> 30:24.625
take little cases.

30:24.658 --> 30:25.892
Lindsay...
DOLE: I'm not ready

30:25.926 --> 30:27.093
to just jump back in,
Bobby.

30:27.127 --> 30:29.195
Uh, I don't know
when I will be.

30:29.229 --> 30:32.132
Uh, and this is a way
for me to take baby steps.

30:32.365 --> 30:34.968
Start a new practice
in this room?

30:35.001 --> 30:36.503
DOLE: I can take little
collection cases,

30:36.537 --> 30:38.572
contract disputes,
fight parking tickets.

30:38.605 --> 30:40.440
I can even be
my own secretary.

30:40.473 --> 30:41.842
I can use your library.

30:41.875 --> 30:43.209
Lucy can help me
with pleadings

30:43.243 --> 30:44.511
from time to time.

30:46.312 --> 30:47.948
I like the quiet here.

30:52.553 --> 30:53.987
YOUNG: Let's not think
for a second

30:54.020 --> 30:55.889
this isn't about freedom
of religion.

30:58.124 --> 30:59.225
There's not even
a suggestion

30:59.259 --> 31:00.901
that Roland
and Wendy Hubert

31:00.934 --> 31:02.302
didn't believe prayer

31:02.335 --> 31:04.871
was capable
of healing their son.

31:04.905 --> 31:06.372
It had in the past.

31:06.406 --> 31:08.341
It had cured Peter
in the past,

31:08.374 --> 31:11.077
and they believed
it would do so here.

31:11.111 --> 31:13.146
They are on trial
because the prosecution

31:13.179 --> 31:16.249
considers that belief,
that religious belief,

31:16.282 --> 31:18.018
to be unreasonable.

31:18.051 --> 31:19.653
And you know what?

31:19.686 --> 31:21.221
So do I.

31:21.254 --> 31:22.956
My kid,
he goes to the hospital.

31:22.989 --> 31:24.825
But that's me, my right.

31:24.858 --> 31:26.993
Mr. and Mrs. Hubert
have their rights.

31:27.027 --> 31:28.394
Problem is,

31:28.428 --> 31:30.163
they picked the wrong time
in the world

31:30.196 --> 31:31.532
to exercise them.

31:31.565 --> 31:34.034
See, the American people
have no tolerance right now

31:34.067 --> 31:36.870
for somebody dying
in the name of a God

31:36.903 --> 31:38.639
from an unpopular
religion.

31:38.672 --> 31:39.940
And that's exactly

31:39.973 --> 31:42.543
why this case
is important.

31:42.576 --> 31:44.344
But not just
to the Huberts,

31:45.311 --> 31:46.747
to all of us.

31:47.681 --> 31:50.116
Every legal scholar
across this country today

31:50.150 --> 31:52.385
is united
in one common sentiment,

31:52.418 --> 31:54.655
we are one
terrorist attack away

31:54.688 --> 31:56.923
from kissing
the constitution goodbye.

31:56.957 --> 31:59.225
Now, this case
isn't about terrorism.

31:59.259 --> 32:00.200
Of course not.

32:00.233 --> 32:02.368
But it is one
affected by it,

32:02.402 --> 32:04.137
because our civil rights,

32:04.170 --> 32:06.106
including and especially

32:06.139 --> 32:07.173
freedom of religion,

32:07.207 --> 32:09.810
are becoming
endangered species.

32:09.843 --> 32:11.945
This trial
would have never happened

32:11.978 --> 32:13.514
before September 11th.

32:13.547 --> 32:15.015
Never.

32:15.048 --> 32:16.817
They can't even show
how medical help

32:16.850 --> 32:18.118
would have saved
Peter Hubert.

32:18.151 --> 32:20.120
He caught a deadly virus

32:20.153 --> 32:22.088
that is fatal
much of the time,

32:22.122 --> 32:23.824
medical care or not.

32:23.857 --> 32:25.225
How?

32:25.258 --> 32:26.560
Huh?

32:26.993 --> 32:29.896
How can you charge
a couple with murder

32:29.930 --> 32:31.832
for not calling a doctor

32:31.865 --> 32:33.667
when the strong
possibility is

32:33.700 --> 32:34.901
calling that doctor

32:34.935 --> 32:36.737
would have made
no difference?

32:38.171 --> 32:39.472
They have no case.

32:41.141 --> 32:42.776
But here we are,
just the same.

32:42.809 --> 32:44.945
Why? Because
the public is angry.

32:44.978 --> 32:47.914
Somebody died, seemingly
for somebody else's God,

32:47.948 --> 32:50.817
and we sure as hell
don't go for that, do we?

32:50.851 --> 32:52.753
Don't you dare think
this isn't a referendum

32:52.786 --> 32:54.387
on Christian Science.

32:54.420 --> 32:55.822
Don't you dare believe

32:55.856 --> 32:57.023
freedom of religion

32:57.057 --> 32:58.525
isn't in play here.

32:58.559 --> 33:00.801
These people
aren't murderers.

33:00.834 --> 33:02.302
They're loving parents.

33:02.335 --> 33:05.672
Even the prosecution's
own witness told you that.

33:05.706 --> 33:07.407
And Mr. Hubert's
testimony?

33:07.440 --> 33:08.909
About the medical
perversities

33:08.942 --> 33:10.443
such as transplants,

33:10.476 --> 33:11.778
stem cell research,

33:11.812 --> 33:13.479
cloning, it's all true.

33:14.014 --> 33:16.482
Doctors playing God.

33:17.818 --> 33:19.052
Well, as human beings,

33:19.085 --> 33:21.387
we all implore,
"Let God be God."

33:23.990 --> 33:26.259
Well, that's what
Wendy and Roland

33:26.292 --> 33:28.294
were trying to do here.

33:28.328 --> 33:31.064
They were attempting
to save their child

33:31.097 --> 33:33.299
by letting God...

33:33.333 --> 33:34.768
be God.

33:41.642 --> 33:43.476
If they succeed
in making this about

33:43.510 --> 33:45.746
freedom of religion,

33:45.779 --> 33:46.913
they win.

33:46.947 --> 33:49.315
Because we're all for the
First Amendment, aren't we?

33:49.349 --> 33:52.018
One person's faith
is no more right

33:52.052 --> 33:53.453
than the next guy's.

33:53.486 --> 33:56.857
If I have the burden
of condemning Christian Science,

33:56.890 --> 33:59.392
then the prosecution loses,

33:59.425 --> 34:00.867
as it should.

34:00.901 --> 34:05.238
But this case has nothing
to do with religion.

34:05.672 --> 34:07.708
This case
is about parenting,

34:08.074 --> 34:10.076
something
we very much hold

34:10.110 --> 34:13.045
up to the standards
of reasonableness,

34:13.079 --> 34:15.248
not to mention decency.

34:15.681 --> 34:18.384
This case is about
a little boy who got sick,

34:18.418 --> 34:20.152
first with a burning fever,

34:20.186 --> 34:21.588
then muscle pain,

34:21.621 --> 34:23.524
nausea, perhaps delirium.

34:23.556 --> 34:25.291
This is about a child

34:25.324 --> 34:27.193
whose lungs filled up with fluid

34:27.226 --> 34:30.831
to the point where
he could no longer breathe,

34:30.864 --> 34:32.264
to the point of death.

34:33.099 --> 34:34.735
All under the watch

34:36.637 --> 34:38.404
of those two people,

34:38.438 --> 34:40.574
his parents.

34:40.607 --> 34:42.442
A neighbor
heard the screams,

34:42.475 --> 34:44.377
called an ambulance.

34:44.409 --> 34:46.580
They sent the paramedics away.

34:47.112 --> 34:49.349
The expert evidence here,

34:49.382 --> 34:51.451
which stands uncontradicted,

34:51.484 --> 34:53.418
is that Peter Hubert

34:53.453 --> 34:56.456
likely would have
been saved

34:56.489 --> 34:58.559
had he gotten
medical attention.

34:59.325 --> 35:01.602
So, we don't need
to dignify

35:01.635 --> 35:04.170
defense counsel's
ridiculous claim

35:04.204 --> 35:05.438
that what they did,

35:05.471 --> 35:07.073
what they didn't do,

35:07.107 --> 35:08.809
made no difference.

35:09.242 --> 35:12.879
You can believe
in whatever God you want,

35:12.913 --> 35:16.349
worship the way you like.

35:16.382 --> 35:19.452
But when you have a child,

35:19.485 --> 35:20.854
when you bring a child

35:20.887 --> 35:23.657
into this world,

35:23.690 --> 35:25.391
you have a duty.

35:25.425 --> 35:27.193
You owe that child.

35:27.227 --> 35:29.963
When you see him dying,

35:29.996 --> 35:32.132
dying a painful death

35:32.165 --> 35:33.900
in front of you,

35:33.934 --> 35:36.737
you have a duty
to get that child

35:36.770 --> 35:38.338
medical attention.

35:38.371 --> 35:40.907
You cannot ignore
that obligation

35:40.941 --> 35:42.342
by cloaking yourself

35:42.375 --> 35:44.611
in some religious freedom.

35:45.712 --> 35:48.214
I'm offended by Mr. Young's

35:48.248 --> 35:49.950
trading on terrorism

35:49.983 --> 35:53.453
on our fears
over our changing world.

35:53.486 --> 35:56.056
I assure you
I prosecuted murderers

35:56.089 --> 35:57.257
before September 11th,

35:57.290 --> 35:59.860
and I continue
to do so after.

35:59.893 --> 36:01.134
If you're looking to draw

36:01.167 --> 36:02.135
any connection,

36:02.168 --> 36:04.805
what happened
September 11th,

36:04.838 --> 36:07.073
what happened
to Peter Hubert,

36:09.475 --> 36:10.877
both were crimes against

36:10.911 --> 36:14.147
the very core of humanity.

36:15.415 --> 36:16.983
A little boy died.

36:18.484 --> 36:19.886
He suffered

36:22.122 --> 36:23.456
because his parents

36:23.489 --> 36:26.026
wouldn't call a doctor.

36:28.795 --> 36:30.964
That's why we're here.

36:30.997 --> 36:33.700
That is the only reason
we are here.

36:49.415 --> 36:51.251
So now...
DONNELL: We wait.

36:51.284 --> 36:52.686
They'll deliberate
till 5:00.

36:52.719 --> 36:54.054
If they haven't reached
a verdict,

36:54.087 --> 36:56.022
they'll suspend
till tomorrow.

36:56.456 --> 36:58.358
Oh.
Wendy?

36:58.391 --> 36:59.860
WENDY: Oh.

36:59.893 --> 37:01.935
Remember how I said
this baby wasn't gonna wait?

37:01.968 --> 37:03.970
Now?

37:04.003 --> 37:06.239
Not this second,
but today.

37:06.272 --> 37:07.406
Okay. Okay.

37:07.440 --> 37:09.242
May--maybe we should get
the paramedics.

37:10.276 --> 37:11.277
Is that okay?

37:11.310 --> 37:12.879
Yeah. To take
her home, yes.

37:12.912 --> 37:14.080
We have a midwife.
I'll call her.

37:14.113 --> 37:16.049
She can meet us there.
WENDY: Oh.

37:21.922 --> 37:23.557
Don't you like it?

37:23.590 --> 37:24.725
Well, yes,

37:24.758 --> 37:26.527
but the personal stuff

37:26.560 --> 37:28.228
is usually
left off the door.

37:28.261 --> 37:30.063
I'll take it off eventually.

37:30.096 --> 37:31.965
But I want the people
who hire me to get the idea.

37:31.998 --> 37:34.701
I'm not gonna be here late
or on call at home.

37:34.735 --> 37:35.969
If they see "mother",

37:36.002 --> 37:38.138
it makes a point.

37:38.171 --> 37:39.706
Yes, it does.

37:39.740 --> 37:40.707
(chuckles)

37:45.946 --> 37:46.913
How'd it go?

37:46.947 --> 37:48.414
I'll know soon.

37:48.448 --> 37:49.550
How about you?

37:49.916 --> 37:50.817
I lost.

37:50.851 --> 37:52.485
Well, you know Swackheim,

37:52.519 --> 37:54.254
lazy, fat.

37:57.090 --> 37:58.892
Listen, uh,

37:58.925 --> 38:00.266
I'm taking some time,

38:01.067 --> 38:03.637
go away, get some rest.

38:05.972 --> 38:07.974
I'm just gonna take
some time.

38:10.644 --> 38:11.477
How much?

38:11.512 --> 38:14.414
Oh, I don't know.

38:14.447 --> 38:15.882
Until I, uh--

38:17.618 --> 38:18.952
I get better.

38:21.822 --> 38:22.656
You will get better.

38:22.689 --> 38:24.490
You--you've just been,

38:24.525 --> 38:26.159
uh, overworked,
overtired.

38:26.192 --> 38:27.393
Yeah.

38:29.062 --> 38:30.130
Helen,

38:31.364 --> 38:32.633
I, uh--

38:37.003 --> 38:37.971
I'm sorry.

38:41.542 --> 38:42.943
Just get yourself well,

38:44.210 --> 38:45.345
whatever it takes.

38:49.550 --> 38:50.884
Well, uh,

38:50.917 --> 38:52.653
I'll be fine.

38:52.686 --> 38:54.087
Uh, um,

38:54.120 --> 38:55.221
(chuckles)

38:55.255 --> 38:56.389
I'll be fine.

38:56.422 --> 38:58.992
I'll be fine.

39:01.735 --> 39:03.103
(pager beeps)

39:03.136 --> 39:04.671
Uh,

39:04.705 --> 39:06.607
well,

39:06.640 --> 39:07.774
the verdict is still
out on me,

39:07.808 --> 39:09.943
but yours just came in.

39:11.678 --> 39:13.479
(sighs)

39:13.514 --> 39:15.549
(grunting)

39:15.582 --> 39:16.783
Oh.

39:18.519 --> 39:19.720
You're doing fine.

39:19.753 --> 39:21.487
You're doing great.

39:21.522 --> 39:23.924
(grunting)

39:24.591 --> 39:26.827
Can they read the verdict
without them present?

39:26.860 --> 39:27.828
They'll have to.

39:28.929 --> 39:31.297
(grunting)

39:31.331 --> 39:33.333
(panting)

39:41.975 --> 39:45.646
(grunting)

39:45.679 --> 39:46.446
Oh.

39:46.479 --> 39:48.148
Madam Foreperson,

39:48.181 --> 39:50.617
has the jury reached
a unanimous verdict?

39:50.651 --> 39:52.018
We have, Your Honor.

39:52.052 --> 39:53.253
Almost.

39:53.286 --> 39:54.688
Keep going.

39:54.721 --> 39:55.622
Just a couple more, honey.

39:55.656 --> 39:56.422
(panting)

39:56.456 --> 39:57.758
Okay. Okay.

39:57.791 --> 39:59.459
FOREPERSON:
In the matter of Commonwealth

39:59.492 --> 40:02.202
versus Roland Hubert
and Wendy Hubert.

40:02.235 --> 40:03.003
On count one,

40:03.036 --> 40:04.871
murder in the second degree

40:04.905 --> 40:06.339
against Roland Hubert,

40:06.372 --> 40:08.675
we find the defendant,

40:08.709 --> 40:10.644
Roland Hubert, guilty.

40:10.677 --> 40:13.814
WENDY: (screaming)

40:13.847 --> 40:15.682
FOREPERSON: On count two,

40:15.716 --> 40:18.752
murder in the second degree
against Wendy Hubert,

40:18.785 --> 40:19.920
we find the defendant,

40:19.953 --> 40:21.622
Wendy Hubert,

40:21.655 --> 40:22.355
guilty.

40:22.388 --> 40:25.091
WENDY: (grunting)

40:25.125 --> 40:26.860
Oh, here he comes.

40:26.893 --> 40:28.562
Oh, he's beautiful.
(baby crying)

40:28.595 --> 40:31.064
(panting)

40:31.097 --> 40:33.233
MIDWIFE: Here he is.

40:33.266 --> 40:36.269
(laughing and sobbing)

40:36.302 --> 40:39.573
(baby crying)

40:39.606 --> 40:42.709
Arrest warrants are issued
for Mr. and Mrs. Hubert.

40:42.743 --> 40:44.745
Your Honor, can we be allowed
to surrender them?

40:44.778 --> 40:46.580
I'm sorry.
Post-conviction.

40:46.613 --> 40:48.248
I can't give you
that courtesy.

40:48.715 --> 40:51.718
Members of the jury,
thank you for your service.

40:51.752 --> 40:53.587
This matter is adjourned.

40:56.823 --> 40:58.525
Can you give me
a 15-minute head start?

40:59.425 --> 41:00.534
Okay.

41:01.668 --> 41:02.869
She had a boy.

41:04.137 --> 41:05.271
Let's go.

41:11.678 --> 41:13.479
YOUNG: They'll take Wendy
to a medical facility.

41:13.514 --> 41:15.949
By law, they have to
at least for a day.

41:18.351 --> 41:19.485
What about my son?

41:20.153 --> 41:21.955
YOUNG: Social services
is on their way.

41:21.988 --> 41:24.057
They take custody initially

41:24.090 --> 41:26.226
until we figure things out.

41:26.259 --> 41:27.661
Why can't he come with us?

41:27.694 --> 41:29.495
I'll make sure
he's okay, Wendy.

41:29.530 --> 41:30.797
Don't you worry.

41:31.297 --> 41:32.232
OFFICER: Let's go.

41:36.937 --> 41:38.739
I'll wait for
social services.

41:46.713 --> 41:49.015
MIDWIFE:
What really happens?

41:49.049 --> 41:50.651
He goes into foster homes?

41:50.684 --> 41:52.185
I'm not really sure.

41:54.087 --> 41:55.956
He's beautiful, isn't he?

41:55.989 --> 41:57.157
Yes.

41:57.190 --> 41:58.759
Would you like to hold him?

42:00.767 --> 42:01.835
Sure.

42:02.368 --> 42:03.436
Here you go.

42:05.672 --> 42:06.840
Okay.

42:12.245 --> 42:13.179
I need to clean up.

42:13.213 --> 42:14.314
I'll just be a second.

42:24.090 --> 42:26.459
What? I'm not adopting,
if that's where you're going.

42:26.492 --> 42:29.730
I wasn't. I was just looking
at an odd sight,

42:29.763 --> 42:31.998
under the circumstances.

42:36.737 --> 42:38.539
He is beautiful.

42:41.274 --> 42:42.042
Yeah.

42:42.075 --> 42:45.011
(music playing)

42:56.690 --> 42:59.726
(music playing)

43:23.089 --> 43:24.090
WOMAN: You stinker.

43:24.224 --> 43:26.159
(music playing)
