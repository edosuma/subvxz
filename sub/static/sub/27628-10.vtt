00:13.957 --> 00:15.007
Thank you.

00:20.968 --> 00:22.501
Please, leave us alone.

00:27.112 --> 00:29.312
It can wear one down, can it not?

00:29.608 --> 00:30.741
The heat, I mean.

00:31.720 --> 00:32.770
Yes.

00:33.704 --> 00:36.688
I should be accustomed to
it by now, but some days...

00:36.712 --> 00:38.245
One can barely breathe.

00:39.336 --> 00:42.403
Give me the bite of a
Russian winter any day.

00:42.757 --> 00:44.690
I'm not sure I'd go that far.

00:44.968 --> 00:46.101
Nicholai Solovey.

00:46.504 --> 00:48.237
Oh. Lady Felicia Montague.

00:49.576 --> 00:50.626
I know.

00:51.757 --> 00:53.712
Back in England, I've taken up residence

00:53.736 --> 00:55.504
at the Royal Sandford Hotel.

00:55.528 --> 00:59.928
From my balcony, I can see the
rooftops of your ancestral estate.

01:01.096 --> 01:04.933
Sadly, the area's beauty has
declined somewhat since your

01:04.956 --> 01:06.471
- departure.
- Oh, really?

01:06.495 --> 01:07.344
[SHE CHUCKLES]

01:07.368 --> 01:11.635
What reason now have the birds
to sing or the flowers to bloom?

01:13.000 --> 01:14.467
I must go back inside.

01:14.920 --> 01:17.008
The Deputy Governor will
be making his speech

01:17.032 --> 01:18.493
and we wouldn't want to miss that.

01:18.517 --> 01:19.567
First...

01:20.296 --> 01:22.163
...I must ask you a question.

01:23.304 --> 01:27.971
As you know, the past few decades
have been difficult for my country.

01:27.997 --> 01:30.464
I believe you may be able to help me.

01:31.176 --> 01:32.226
Mr Solovey...

01:32.968 --> 01:36.301
...I fear you over-estimate
my level of influence.

01:37.717 --> 01:39.984
No, I'm not interested in state secrets.

01:40.008 --> 01:41.520
It is a personal matter.

01:41.544 --> 01:42.594
Go on.

01:44.317 --> 01:48.717
Artefacts belonging to my family
were seized after the revolution

01:48.904 --> 01:52.437
and sold by the Antikvariat
to collectors in Europe.

01:55.496 --> 01:56.563
Oh, my necklace!

01:57.544 --> 02:01.497
By the Faberge work-master
Henrik Wigstrom.

02:01.522 --> 02:03.045
Mm.

02:03.240 --> 02:06.973
I had hoped you would be
willing to sell it back to me.

02:07.528 --> 02:10.527
I'd make sure you were
suitably compensated.

02:10.600 --> 02:13.776
I have great sympathy
for your family's losses,

02:13.800 --> 02:16.400
but this necklace was a
gift from my late father.

02:16.424 --> 02:18.757
It would break my heart to sell it.

02:20.077 --> 02:21.610
How can I persuade you?

02:23.557 --> 02:24.607
After all...

02:25.477 --> 02:27.210
...I am its rightful owner.

02:28.264 --> 02:29.314
I'm sorry.

02:31.477 --> 02:32.527
Oh.

02:33.064 --> 02:35.131
Don't worry about Yuri. He's...

02:36.456 --> 02:37.523
...an old friend.

02:38.824 --> 02:40.813
- Please.
- Even if I were willing,

02:40.837 --> 02:42.768
I don't have the necklace with me.

02:42.792 --> 02:44.880
It was safer to leave it in England.

02:44.904 --> 02:46.904
Not an insurmountable problem.

02:47.797 --> 02:50.730
I am not known for
easily conceding defeat.

02:52.520 --> 02:55.653
- Perhaps if...
- Forgive me, my answer is no.

02:57.064 --> 02:58.531
I hope you understand.

02:58.920 --> 03:02.387
If you change your mind,
you know where to find me.

03:04.936 --> 03:09.403
Who can tell, Lady Felicia, what
tribulations the future may hold?

03:54.344 --> 03:55.394
- Oh-ho.
- Oh!

03:56.008 --> 04:00.008
Who in the world could travel
thousands of miles and arrive

04:00.232 --> 04:01.872
without a hair out of place?

04:01.896 --> 04:04.880
I don't know about that,
my dear Mrs McCarthy,

04:04.904 --> 04:07.120
but I certainly feel
better for seeing you.

04:07.144 --> 04:08.194
Bunty!

04:10.024 --> 04:13.264
- Travelling light, Aunt Fliss.
- I'm impressed!

04:13.288 --> 04:16.355
Ah, well, I had to pack
for a colder climate.

04:16.872 --> 04:19.272
Hornby said he'd collect them later.

04:20.007 --> 04:23.312
May we finally find out
the reason for your visit?

04:23.336 --> 04:25.232
Your letter was somewhat cryptic.

04:25.256 --> 04:26.389
All in good time.

04:26.984 --> 04:30.251
I am positively gasping
for a proper cup of tea!

04:30.312 --> 04:31.362
Oh! Tea!

04:34.216 --> 04:35.266
Oh!

04:44.328 --> 04:45.995
It's all so embarrassing.

04:46.504 --> 04:47.704
About a month ago,

04:47.848 --> 04:51.280
Monty was approached about
an investment opportunity.

04:51.304 --> 04:54.437
A diamond mine, supposedly
filled to the brim.

04:54.888 --> 04:56.555
- How exciting!
- Quite.

04:56.936 --> 04:58.536
Only, Monty being Monty,

04:58.856 --> 05:02.456
greed got the better of him
and he offered to finance

05:02.888 --> 05:04.288
the whole enterprise.

05:04.616 --> 05:07.149
Invested every penny we have and more.

05:08.797 --> 05:12.733
It transpires the mine had
fewer genuine diamonds than your

05:12.757 --> 05:14.024
average pawnbroker.

05:14.152 --> 05:17.200
And to make matters worse,
there was a terrible accident.

05:17.224 --> 05:18.557
Workers got injured.

05:19.848 --> 05:22.915
And, being the legal
owner, Monty was liable.

05:25.416 --> 05:27.083
So... you're coming home?

05:28.296 --> 05:29.346
Sadly, no.

05:30.037 --> 05:33.504
I'm simply back to auction
off the family trinkets.

05:33.637 --> 05:35.104
Artworks, jewellery...

05:36.517 --> 05:39.117
We need to raise an awful lot of money.

05:39.757 --> 05:41.776
But presumably the house is safe?

05:41.800 --> 05:44.413
I hope so. It depends
on how the auction goes.

05:44.437 --> 05:47.370
Having to sell all your
prized possessions!

05:47.688 --> 05:49.555
They're only objects, Mrs M.

05:49.736 --> 05:53.552
Save your prayers for the poor
men who were down that mine.

05:53.576 --> 05:57.072
They had families to feed, and
I'm damned if I'm going to let

05:57.096 --> 05:59.563
Monty wriggle out of his obligations.

06:00.232 --> 06:01.832
So when is this auction?

06:02.344 --> 06:06.800
Hornby is driving me to the bank
tomorrow morning so I can collect

06:06.824 --> 06:10.704
a few items from the vault, and
then straight to the auction house.

06:10.728 --> 06:12.580
Well, let me drive you,
for moral support.

06:12.605 --> 06:15.285
Why don't we all go?

06:15.784 --> 06:16.834
You're so kind.

06:18.024 --> 06:19.074
Now...

06:19.688 --> 06:21.088
...who wants a top-up?

06:26.557 --> 06:27.690
We won't be long.

06:48.040 --> 06:50.064
Maybe you could keep the necklace

06:50.088 --> 06:53.293
and the rest of the things
would raise enough money?

06:53.317 --> 06:55.312
Not according to the evaluation.

06:55.336 --> 06:58.704
And if we don't clear the debt
soon, the estate's in danger,

06:58.728 --> 07:00.928
and I can't risk losing Montague.

07:01.416 --> 07:04.464
Your memories of your father
are the real treasure.

07:04.488 --> 07:06.888
Quite so. I should get a good price.

07:08.584 --> 07:12.651
We've already had one offer
from a Russian chap in Rhodesia.

07:13.576 --> 07:16.752
Well, why not sell to him and
save yourself all this trouble?

07:16.776 --> 07:18.864
Well, to be honest, there
was something about him

07:18.888 --> 07:20.488
that put the wind up me.

07:21.768 --> 07:25.368
And if it must sell, I'd
rather it go to a good home.

07:27.976 --> 07:29.026
Right.

07:29.960 --> 07:31.627
Let's get this over with.

07:48.997 --> 07:52.976
Can I give you a lift, Father?
I can pick Bucephalus up later.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.067
No, thank you. Exercise
is good for the soul!

07:56.264 --> 07:57.864
Well, you're the expert.

08:00.936 --> 08:01.986
I know him!

08:03.517 --> 08:05.384
- Who?
- Something's wrong.

08:05.736 --> 08:07.269
Quick, follow that van!

08:11.112 --> 08:12.162
Oh. Excuse me?

08:13.237 --> 08:14.287
Leave it to me!

08:15.336 --> 08:16.736
Careful on that bike!

08:46.184 --> 08:47.784
[PLANE RATTLES OVERHEAD]

09:28.872 --> 09:32.880
He's conscious but we won't get
much sense out of him for a while.

09:32.904 --> 09:34.435
I'll contact the security company,

09:34.460 --> 09:36.208
see if they can identify the driver.

09:36.233 --> 09:38.831
I told you, his name is Yuri.

09:38.856 --> 09:40.944
Ah, yes, the mysterious Russian!

09:40.968 --> 09:42.968
He works for Nicholai Solovey.

09:43.528 --> 09:45.744
Or, and I'm only
speaking hypothetically,

09:45.768 --> 09:48.624
- it's someone else with a similar scar.
- Ugh!

09:48.648 --> 09:53.115
All right, I'll look into it, but
I suspect the culprit's a local.

09:57.160 --> 10:00.464
If it was an opportunist, why did he
take only take the necklace?

10:00.511 --> 10:02.353
There were plenty of other
valuables in that case.

10:02.377 --> 10:04.001
He probably made his getaway on foot

10:04.142 --> 10:05.776
and didn't want too much to carry.

10:05.800 --> 10:09.493
- Either way, we'll catch him.
- And retrieve the stolen item.

10:09.517 --> 10:11.293
He's probably melting
it down as we speak.

10:11.317 --> 10:13.584
- Oh!
- Makes it easier to fence.

10:13.800 --> 10:15.333
But we might get lucky.

10:15.912 --> 10:17.045
I'll be in touch.

10:18.037 --> 10:19.504
Solovey's behind this!

10:20.328 --> 10:24.336
In fact, I'm sure he's responsible
for the whole diamond mine

10:24.360 --> 10:26.773
debacle. Anything to force
me to sell that necklace!

10:26.797 --> 10:30.672
You said he was wealthy - why
wouldn't he just buy it at auction?

10:30.696 --> 10:33.296
Perhaps he wanted to punish you
for refusing his offer.

10:33.320 --> 10:35.253
So you do believe me, Father?

10:35.496 --> 10:38.032
I believe that if we want to
retrieve the necklace,

10:38.056 --> 10:40.523
Nicholai Solovey is the way to start.

10:41.197 --> 10:44.264
- Luckily, I know where he lives... Yes
- Oh.

10:55.016 --> 10:56.066
So what now?

10:57.517 --> 11:00.496
Aunt Fliss and I march in
there and confront him.

11:00.520 --> 11:02.672
Five shillings says we'll
beat a confession out of him

11:02.696 --> 11:03.760
in under a minute.

11:03.784 --> 11:06.345
I appreciate your enthusiasm,
Bunty, but this is my problem.

11:06.415 --> 11:07.587
Your problem?

11:07.612 --> 11:09.520
If you don't get this necklace
back, then you'll be forced

11:09.544 --> 11:12.080
to sell Montague and I'll be
turfed out into the streets!

11:12.104 --> 11:14.773
I'll be like Blind Harry,
roaming around Kembleford...

11:14.797 --> 11:17.136
Don't be melodramatic. I'm sure
your mother and father will

11:17.160 --> 11:19.376
permit your return,
given the circumstances.

11:19.400 --> 11:21.267
What? And go back to London?

11:22.280 --> 11:24.880
Perhaps I should go in, test the water.

11:26.197 --> 11:28.720
Solovey doesn't know we're acquainted.

11:28.744 --> 11:29.794
Very well.

11:29.960 --> 11:32.304
But if you draw a blank
we're doing this my way.

11:32.328 --> 11:34.608
And my way involves pruning shears.

11:34.632 --> 11:37.965
Yes, I've always had my
doubts about your family.

11:38.408 --> 11:41.413
Well, their clientele leaves
something to be desired,

11:41.437 --> 11:43.570
but I do approve of their staff.

11:44.197 --> 11:46.464
- Isn't that Daniel Winks?
- Who?

11:46.856 --> 11:48.989
He was a chorister at St Mary's.

11:49.416 --> 11:52.464
Not the Daniel Winks that
got blind drunk before the

11:52.488 --> 11:56.888
Christmas concert and then was
violently sick over my best shoes?

11:57.160 --> 11:58.210
The very same.

11:58.597 --> 12:00.664
I was always quite fond of him.

12:01.717 --> 12:02.767
Sorry.

12:06.888 --> 12:09.155
- Thank you.
- Much obliged, sir.

12:11.240 --> 12:13.213
Keeping out of trouble, Mr Winks?

12:13.237 --> 12:15.237
Father Brown! It's been years!

12:15.464 --> 12:16.997
St Mary's hasn't moved.

12:17.384 --> 12:19.472
You're welcome to return at any time.

12:19.496 --> 12:22.160
Not the impression I got from Mrs
McCarthy last time I was there.

12:22.184 --> 12:24.251
She's nothing if not forgiving.

12:24.360 --> 12:26.773
Must be talking about
different Mrs McCarthys.

12:26.797 --> 12:28.880
So what brings you to
the Royal Sandborough?

12:28.904 --> 12:31.104
I'm looking for Nicholai Solovey.

12:31.678 --> 12:32.865
The Russian?

12:32.936 --> 12:35.344
This time of day, he'll be in
the bar, reading the papers.

12:35.368 --> 12:38.736
Tell him he'll never get to
heaven if he don't tip the staff.

12:38.760 --> 12:40.760
Could you point him out to me?

12:42.536 --> 12:44.869
For you, Father, it's on the house.

12:59.560 --> 13:00.610
Good morning.

13:02.197 --> 13:03.247
Father.

13:09.224 --> 13:11.491
Have you heard the appalling news?

13:12.296 --> 13:13.346
Hm?

13:13.384 --> 13:14.434
The robbery.

13:15.688 --> 13:19.088
Lady Montague's necklace stolen
in broad daylight!

13:20.317 --> 13:23.650
The world is slipping into
a moral abyss, Father.

13:24.328 --> 13:27.376
You must've noticed,
considering your profession.

13:27.400 --> 13:28.450
Indeed.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.053
Darkness surrounds us,

13:31.281 --> 13:34.217
but the Lord provides a
path towards the light.

13:34.376 --> 13:37.488
Then maybe it was He who
lightened the lady's pockets...

13:37.512 --> 13:40.379
...so she may more
easily pass into heaven.

13:46.920 --> 13:51.587
Are you not concerned that such a
crime has occurred on our doorstep?

13:51.784 --> 13:54.184
My valuables are under lock and key.

13:54.408 --> 13:58.408
Perhaps the countess should
have exercised similar caution.

13:58.888 --> 14:03.221
In her defence, I've heard a rumour
that the necklace is cursed.

14:05.352 --> 14:06.402
Cursed?

14:06.914 --> 14:08.938
The family it once belonged to

14:08.963 --> 14:11.738
were nearly destroyed
by the Bolsheviks.

14:12.456 --> 14:16.256
And the new owner now finds
herself beset by misfortune.

14:19.496 --> 14:22.160
I'm surprised a man of the cloth
would give credence to tales

14:22.184 --> 14:23.317
of cursed jewels.

14:24.877 --> 14:27.144
I never said I gave them credence.

14:27.688 --> 14:31.688
But whoever stole this necklace
would do well to return it,

14:32.040 --> 14:34.040
lest the same fate befall him!

14:40.104 --> 14:41.154
You jest.

14:43.240 --> 14:44.573
I am disturbing you.

14:44.917 --> 14:46.650
- It's fine.
- I must go.

14:47.208 --> 14:48.258
Souls to save.

14:54.517 --> 14:58.050
In my opinion, there is no abyss,
moral or physical,

15:00.037 --> 15:02.970
that cannot be overcome
by a leap of faith.

42:32.936 --> 42:34.064
How does it feel?

42:34.088 --> 42:36.688
All those years you tried to
make me an honourable man,

42:36.712 --> 42:39.376
yet it is I who has
turned you into a thief.

42:39.400 --> 42:41.360
You could have taken Solovey's hoard...

42:41.384 --> 42:43.664
I would have been
powerless to stop you...

42:43.688 --> 42:44.755
but you did not.

42:45.096 --> 42:47.296
Neither did I leave empty-handed.

42:47.677 --> 42:48.727
Ah, yes...

42:49.128 --> 42:50.261
...Solovey's cash.

42:52.648 --> 42:54.096
I confess I am disappointed.

42:54.120 --> 42:57.987
I never thought that you were
motivated by avarice alone.

42:58.237 --> 43:00.624
Then you'll be pleased to hear
I invested it in an item of

43:00.648 --> 43:03.120
immense aesthetic and spiritual value.

43:03.144 --> 43:04.677
I was going to keep it,

43:04.957 --> 43:07.408
but I think I might give
it to a lady friend.

43:07.432 --> 43:10.632
An apology for certain
uncouth actions of mine.

43:11.016 --> 43:13.283
How uncharacteristically contrite.

43:13.597 --> 43:14.997
Well, what can I say?

43:15.304 --> 43:18.904
She is someone I hold in
the highest possible regard.
