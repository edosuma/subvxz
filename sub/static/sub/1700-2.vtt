WEBVTT

00:02.877 --> 00:04.294
What you guys don't understand is...

00:04.504 --> 00:07.548
...for us, kissing is as important
as any part of it.

00:07.924 --> 00:09.508
Yeah, right.

00:11.970 --> 00:13.095
You serious?

00:14.139 --> 00:15.097
Oh, yeah.

00:15.306 --> 00:17.683
Everything you need to know
is in that first kiss.

00:17.892 --> 00:19.768
- Absolutely.
- Yeah, I think, for us...

00:19.978 --> 00:22.021
...kissing is pretty much
like an opening act.

00:22.230 --> 00:24.773
I mean, it's like the stand-up comedian
you have to sit through...

00:24.983 --> 00:27.109
...before Pink Floyd comes out.

00:30.363 --> 00:33.699
Yeah, and it's not that
we don't like the comedian.

00:33.908 --> 00:37.077
It's just that that's not...

00:37.287 --> 00:39.288
...why we bought the ticket.

00:40.707 --> 00:42.207
See, the problem is, though...

00:42.417 --> 00:45.002
...after the concert's over,
no matter how great the show was...

00:45.211 --> 00:48.672
...you girls are always looking
for the comedian again.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.883
I mean, we're in the car,
we're fighting traffic...

00:51.092 --> 00:53.844
...basically just trying to stay awake.

00:55.889 --> 00:58.932
Yeah, well, word of advice:
Bring back the comedian.

00:59.142 --> 01:00.893
Otherwise, you're gonna find yourself...

01:01.102 --> 01:03.687
...sitting at home
listening to that album alone.

01:08.443 --> 01:10.778
Are we still talking about sex?

02:05.333 --> 02:07.209
No, it's good. It is good.

02:07.418 --> 02:11.088
It's just that,
doesn't she seem a little angry?

02:11.297 --> 02:13.006
Well, she has issues.

02:14.717 --> 02:16.218
Does she?

02:16.427 --> 02:18.637
He's out banging other women
over the head with a club...

02:18.847 --> 02:22.683
...while she sits at home trying to get
the mastodon smell out of the carpet.

02:22.934 --> 02:25.978
Marsha, see, these are cave people.

02:27.021 --> 02:29.356
Okay, they have issues like:

02:29.566 --> 02:33.569
"Gee, that glacier's getting kind of close."
See?

02:33.778 --> 02:35.863
Speaking of issues,
isn't that your ex-wife?

02:36.072 --> 02:38.740
- No, no.
- Yes, it is. Carol, hi.

02:38.950 --> 02:40.492
Okay. Yes. Yes, it is.

02:40.702 --> 02:43.078
How about I'll catch up with you
in the Ice Age?

02:57.969 --> 02:59.761
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:06.936 --> 03:08.520
So...

03:09.355 --> 03:11.190
You look great.

03:11.983 --> 03:13.066
I hate that.

03:14.068 --> 03:17.362
Sorry. Thanks. You look good too.

03:17.572 --> 03:20.490
Well, you know, in here, anyone who...

03:22.076 --> 03:23.327
...stands erect...

03:26.748 --> 03:28.624
- So, what's new? Still a...
- A lesbian?

03:28.833 --> 03:30.417
Well...

03:31.502 --> 03:32.961
You never know.

03:33.171 --> 03:35.214
How's, um...? How's the family?

03:35.715 --> 03:37.799
Marty's still totally paranoid.

03:38.009 --> 03:41.094
- Oh, and...
- Carol, why are you here, Carol?

03:42.513 --> 03:45.224
- I'm pregnant.
- Pregnant.

03:52.857 --> 03:56.235
Oh. Looks like she didn't leave
in such a hurry after all.

03:56.611 --> 03:58.695
I think this is the episode
of Three's Company...

03:58.905 --> 04:01.198
...where's there's some kind
of misunderstanding.

04:04.118 --> 04:06.536
Then I've already seen this one.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.998
Are you through with that? Thanks.

04:10.208 --> 04:12.626
Yeah, sorry, the swallowing
slowed me down.

04:14.128 --> 04:15.921
Whose little ball of paper is this?

04:16.130 --> 04:17.172
Oh, that would be mine.

04:17.382 --> 04:19.841
See, I wrote a note to myself,
then I didn't need it.

04:20.051 --> 04:22.261
So I balled it up
and now I wish I was dead.

04:24.847 --> 04:27.724
She already fluffed that pillow.
Monica, you know, you already fluffed...

04:27.934 --> 04:29.768
But it's fine.

04:30.228 --> 04:31.186
Look, I'm sorry.

04:31.396 --> 04:33.855
I don't want to give them
any more ammunition than they have.

04:34.065 --> 04:35.941
Yes, we know how cruel
a parent can be...

04:36.150 --> 04:39.278
...about the flatness of a child's pillow.

04:39.821 --> 04:42.281
Monica? Hi. Um...

04:42.865 --> 04:45.325
Monica, um, you're scaring me.

04:46.661 --> 04:50.247
I mean, you're, like, all chaotic
and twirly, you know?

04:50.456 --> 04:51.665
Not in a good way.

04:53.543 --> 04:54.710
Yeah, calm down.

04:54.919 --> 04:59.214
You don't see Ross getting all chaotic
and twirly every time they come.

04:59.424 --> 05:03.302
That's because, as far as my parents are
concerned, Ross can do no wrong.

05:03.511 --> 05:05.554
You see, he's the prince.

05:05.763 --> 05:09.141
Apparently they had some big ceremony
before I was born.

05:10.893 --> 05:12.561
Ew, ew, ew.

05:12.812 --> 05:15.439
- What?
- Ugly Naked Guy got a ThighMaster.

05:18.067 --> 05:19.526
Ew.

05:20.528 --> 05:23.322
- Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
- Yeah, it's beautiful.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.370
Oh, God. Oh, God.

05:30.580 --> 05:34.041
- Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.
- No, don't touch that.

05:36.461 --> 05:40.714
Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough
having to give it back to him.

05:40.965 --> 05:42.716
"Hi, Barry, remember me? I'm the girl...

05:42.925 --> 05:46.094
...that stomped on your heart
in front of your entire family"

05:46.304 --> 05:49.639
Oh, God. Now I'm gonna have to
return the ring, without the ring...

05:49.849 --> 05:52.726
...which makes it so much harder.

05:53.603 --> 05:55.562
Easy, Rach, we'll find it. Won't we?

05:55.772 --> 05:57.481
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay, look.

06:00.151 --> 06:01.693
When did you have it on last?

06:01.903 --> 06:04.237
Doy. Probably right before she lost it.

06:06.574 --> 06:09.242
You don't get a lot of "doy" these days.

06:10.870 --> 06:13.705
I know I had it this morning.

06:13.915 --> 06:16.792
I know I had it when I was
in the kitchen with...

06:17.001 --> 06:18.627
Dinah?

06:21.297 --> 06:24.049
Oh, don't be mad.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.885
- You didn't.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

06:27.095 --> 06:29.388
I gave you one job.

06:30.598 --> 06:33.683
Oh, but look how straight
those noodles are.

06:34.477 --> 06:38.522
Monica, you know that's not how you look
for an engagement ring in a lasagna.

06:41.025 --> 06:42.609
I just can't do it.

06:43.861 --> 06:45.153
Boys?

06:46.030 --> 06:47.697
We're going in.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.416
Hi.

06:58.334 --> 07:00.544
Oh, that is not a happy "hi."

07:00.753 --> 07:02.254
Carol's pregnant.

07:02.463 --> 07:04.047
Oh, I found it.

07:06.217 --> 07:09.302
Well, what...? What?

07:09.720 --> 07:11.054
Yeah.

07:12.014 --> 07:13.348
Do that for another two hours...

07:13.558 --> 07:16.560
...you might be where I am
right about now.

07:17.603 --> 07:20.814
Kind of puts that whole pillow thing
in perspective, huh, Mon?

07:23.151 --> 07:25.152
Well, now, how do you fit
into this whole thing?

07:25.361 --> 07:28.447
Well, Carol says she and Susan
want me to be involved.

07:28.656 --> 07:33.285
But if I'm not comfortable with it,
I don't have to be involved.

07:33.578 --> 07:35.495
Basically, it's totally up to me.

07:35.705 --> 07:37.914
She is so great. I miss her.

07:43.171 --> 07:44.546
What does she mean by "involved"?

07:44.755 --> 07:47.340
I mean, presumably,
the biggest part of your job is done.

07:49.594 --> 07:52.179
Anyway, they want me
to go down to this...

07:52.388 --> 07:54.806
...sonogram thing with them tomorrow.

07:55.016 --> 07:56.057
So, what are you gonna do?

07:56.267 --> 07:58.310
I have no idea.

07:58.519 --> 08:02.147
No matter what I do, though,
I'm still gonna be a father.

08:12.241 --> 08:13.909
Well, this is still ruined, right?

08:19.832 --> 08:23.835
Oh. Martha Lugwin's daughter
is gonna call you.

08:25.505 --> 08:28.381
Mm. What's that curry taste?

08:28.841 --> 08:30.133
Curry.

08:31.344 --> 08:32.802
Mm.

08:34.472 --> 08:37.557
I think they're great. I really do.

08:37.767 --> 08:38.725
You remember the Lugwins?

08:38.934 --> 08:40.809
The big one had a thing for you,
didn't she?

08:41.020 --> 08:42.770
They all had a thing for him.

08:43.648 --> 08:44.731
Oh, Mom.

08:44.941 --> 08:47.025
I'm sorry.
Why is this girl going to call me?

08:47.235 --> 08:51.738
Oh, she just graduated, and she wants
to be something in cooking or food...

08:51.948 --> 08:53.073
...or I don't know.

08:53.282 --> 08:55.659
Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant,
so...

08:55.868 --> 08:58.537
No, Mom. I don't have a restaurant.
I work in a restaurant.

08:58.746 --> 09:01.414
Well, they don't have to know that.

09:04.669 --> 09:06.962
Ross, could you come and help me
with the spaghetti.

09:07.171 --> 09:08.129
Yes.

09:08.339 --> 09:10.590
Oh, we're having spaghetti. That's...

09:10.800 --> 09:12.259
...easy.

09:14.262 --> 09:17.347
I know this is going to sound
unbelievably selfish on my part...

09:17.557 --> 09:20.767
...but were you planning on bringing
up the whole baby/lesbian thing?

09:20.977 --> 09:23.687
Because I think it might take
some of the heat off me.

09:26.816 --> 09:30.652
What that Rachel did to her life.
We ran into her parents at the club.

09:30.861 --> 09:32.821
They were not playing very well.

09:33.030 --> 09:35.282
I'm not gonna tell you
what they spent on that wedding...

09:35.658 --> 09:38.034
...but $40,000 is a lot of money.

09:40.997 --> 09:44.666
Well, at least she had the chance
to leave a man at the altar.

09:47.837 --> 09:50.589
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

09:50.798 --> 09:54.092
- It's an expression.
- No, it's not.

09:54.302 --> 09:55.468
Don't listen to your mother.

09:55.678 --> 09:57.637
You're independent
and you always have been.

09:57.847 --> 10:00.307
Even when you were a kid,
and you were chubby...

10:00.516 --> 10:03.351
...and you had no friends,
you were just fine.

10:05.146 --> 10:08.273
You'd read alone in your room.
And your puzzles...

10:11.819 --> 10:15.780
Look, there are people, like Ross,
who need to shoot for the stars.

10:15.990 --> 10:18.825
With his museum and his papers
getting published.

10:19.035 --> 10:21.286
Other people are satisfied
with staying where they are.

10:21.495 --> 10:25.165
I'm telling you, these are the people
who never get cancer.

10:28.085 --> 10:32.213
And I read about these women
trying to have it all, and I thank God...

10:32.423 --> 10:35.425
...our little Harmonica
doesn't seem to have that problem.

10:38.137 --> 10:40.847
So, Ross, what's going on with you?

10:41.891 --> 10:45.977
Any stories? No news, no little
anecdotes to share with the folks?

10:46.187 --> 10:47.270
Okay, okay.

10:49.273 --> 10:54.027
Ahem. Look, I, uh... I realize you guys
have been wondering...

10:54.236 --> 10:56.863
...what exactly happened
between Carol and me.

10:57.073 --> 10:58.865
And so, well, here's the deal.

11:01.911 --> 11:03.370
Carol's a lesbian.

11:05.623 --> 11:07.874
She's living with a woman named Susan.

11:09.835 --> 11:12.921
She's pregnant with my child.

11:13.464 --> 11:16.466
And she and Susan
are going to raise the baby.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.180
And you knew about this?

11:36.904 --> 11:38.655
Your folks are really that bad, huh?

11:39.782 --> 11:42.325
Well, you know, these people are pros.

11:44.620 --> 11:47.163
They know what they're doing.
They take their time.

11:47.373 --> 11:50.041
They get the job done.

11:51.836 --> 11:55.004
Boy, I know they say that
you can't change your parents.

11:55.214 --> 11:58.341
Boy, if you could, I'd want yours.

12:00.302 --> 12:01.928
Must pee.

12:03.013 --> 12:04.764
You know, it's even worse
when you're twins.

12:04.974 --> 12:07.142
- You're a twin?
- Oh, yeah. We don't speak.

12:07.351 --> 12:10.145
She's like this high-powered,
driven, career-type.

12:10.479 --> 12:12.313
- What does she do?
- She's a waitress.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.527
All right. You guys,
I kind of gotta clean up now.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.613
Chandler, you're an only child, right?
You don't have any of this.

12:20.823 --> 12:24.159
Well, no, although I did
have an imaginary friend...

12:24.368 --> 12:26.244
...who my parents actually preferred.

12:28.539 --> 12:30.582
Hit the lights, please.

12:37.506 --> 12:38.923
How long was I in there?

12:40.718 --> 12:41.885
I'm just cleaning up.

12:42.636 --> 12:45.472
Oh, do you, uh...?
Do you need any help?

12:45.681 --> 12:48.349
Um, okay, sure. Thanks.

12:54.231 --> 12:55.690
Anyway...

12:56.358 --> 12:59.194
So you nervous about Barry tomorrow?

12:59.403 --> 13:02.155
- Oh, a little.
- Mm-hm.

13:03.282 --> 13:05.200
- A lot.
- Mm-hm.

13:05.910 --> 13:08.453
So got any advice?

13:08.662 --> 13:11.748
You know, as someone
who's recently been dumped.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.461
Well, you may want to steer clear
of the word "dumped."

13:17.880 --> 13:22.091
Chances are he's going to be this
broken shell of a man. You know?

13:22.301 --> 13:26.346
So you should try not to look too terrific.
I know it'll be hard.

13:29.850 --> 13:34.229
Or, you know, hey, I'll go down there,
and I'll give Barry back his ring.

13:34.438 --> 13:38.775
And you can go with Carol
and Susan to the OB-GYN.

13:41.028 --> 13:43.488
You've got Carol tomorrow.

13:44.323 --> 13:46.282
When did it get so complicated?

13:46.492 --> 13:47.784
Got me.

13:48.452 --> 13:51.079
- Remember when we were in high school?
- Yeah.

13:51.288 --> 13:53.790
I mean, didn't you think
you' were gonna meet someone...

13:53.999 --> 13:56.543
...fall in love, and that'd be it?

14:01.590 --> 14:03.508
- Ross?
- Yes, yes.

14:05.135 --> 14:08.805
Oh. Man. I never thought I'd be here.

14:16.730 --> 14:18.398
Me neither.

14:35.624 --> 14:37.876
Hi. Sorry I'm late. I got stuck at work.

14:38.085 --> 14:41.546
There was this big
dinosaur thing. Anyway...

14:42.631 --> 14:44.173
Hi.

14:44.758 --> 14:47.886
- Ross, you remember Susan.
- How could I forget?

14:48.095 --> 14:49.262
Ross.

14:49.471 --> 14:52.098
Hello, Susan. Good shake, good shake.

14:54.018 --> 14:56.728
So, uh, we're just waiting for?

14:56.937 --> 14:59.230
- Dr. Oberman.
- Dr. Oberman. Okay, and is he...?

14:59.440 --> 15:01.983
- She.
- Of course, "she."

15:02.776 --> 15:07.196
She, uh, familiar
with our special situation?

15:07.406 --> 15:09.240
Yes, and she's very supportive.

15:09.450 --> 15:11.534
Great. Okay, that's great. Heh.

15:13.162 --> 15:14.704
No, I'm...

15:15.706 --> 15:17.165
Thanks.

15:31.680 --> 15:32.889
Quack, quack...

15:33.098 --> 15:35.099
...quack, quack, quack.

15:35.309 --> 15:36.976
Ross?

15:37.311 --> 15:38.937
That opens my cervix.

15:45.778 --> 15:48.279
- Barry?
- Come on in.

15:48.489 --> 15:49.447
Are you sure?

15:49.657 --> 15:52.116
It's fine, it's fine.
Robbie's gonna be here for hours.

15:52.326 --> 15:53.493
Huh?

15:56.705 --> 15:58.414
So how are you doing?

15:59.583 --> 16:01.250
I'm...

16:01.919 --> 16:03.753
I'm okay.

16:04.630 --> 16:05.797
You look great.

16:06.215 --> 16:07.256
Yeah, well...

16:08.008 --> 16:10.635
Dr. Farber, Jason Greenspan's gagging.

16:10.844 --> 16:13.596
Be right there. I'll be back in a second.

16:18.686 --> 16:20.186
I dumped him.

16:21.522 --> 16:22.814
Okay.

16:31.365 --> 16:32.573
Oh!

16:37.496 --> 16:42.125
- Ross.
- So, um...? So how's this going to work...

16:42.334 --> 16:43.918
...ahem, you know, with us?

16:44.128 --> 16:47.046
You know, when, like, important
decisions have to be made?

16:47.423 --> 16:48.715
Give me a "for instance."

16:48.924 --> 16:50.591
Well, I don't know. Okay, okay.

16:50.801 --> 16:53.136
- How about with the baby's name?
- Marlon...

16:53.345 --> 16:57.181
- Marlon.
...if it's a boy. Minnie, if it's a girl.

16:59.268 --> 17:00.893
As in "Mouse"?

17:02.438 --> 17:03.813
As in my grandmother.

17:04.690 --> 17:07.733
Still, you say "Minnie,"
you hear "Mouse."

17:09.819 --> 17:11.404
How about, um...

17:12.071 --> 17:13.489
How about "Julia"?

17:14.366 --> 17:15.407
Julia.

17:15.617 --> 17:16.784
We agreed on Minnie.

17:16.993 --> 17:19.746
It's funny, um, we agreed
we'd spend our lives together.

17:19.997 --> 17:22.790
Things change. Roll with the punches.

17:23.333 --> 17:25.251
I believe Julia's on the table.

17:27.337 --> 17:29.714
Oh. Sorry about that.

17:32.926 --> 17:35.344
So, what have you been up to?

17:35.554 --> 17:38.389
Oh. Not much.

17:38.599 --> 17:41.392
- I got a job.
- Hey, that's great.

17:42.519 --> 17:43.936
Why are you so tan?

17:45.022 --> 17:46.189
Oh, I, uh...

17:46.899 --> 17:48.649
I went to Aruba.

17:48.984 --> 17:51.778
Oh, no.
You went on our honeymoon alone?

17:51.987 --> 17:53.488
No.

17:55.407 --> 17:58.493
See, uh, I went with...

17:59.953 --> 18:01.412
- Now, this may hurt.
- Me?

18:01.622 --> 18:02.872
No.

18:05.876 --> 18:06.959
I went with Mindy.

18:07.836 --> 18:09.462
Mindy?

18:10.047 --> 18:11.714
My maid of honor, Mindy?

18:11.924 --> 18:14.592
Yeah, well, we're kind of a thing now.

18:16.470 --> 18:18.012
Well, I'm...

18:19.139 --> 18:20.973
You got plugs.

18:21.183 --> 18:24.018
Careful, careful.
They haven't quite taken yet.

18:24.645 --> 18:26.979
And you got lenses.

18:27.231 --> 18:29.899
But you hate sticking
your finger in your eye.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.818
Not for her.

18:32.903 --> 18:34.070
Oh.

18:35.697 --> 18:38.074
Listen, I really wanted to thank you.

18:38.742 --> 18:40.159
Okay.

18:41.078 --> 18:42.995
About a month ago, I wanted to hurt you...

18:43.413 --> 18:45.790
...more than I've ever
wanted to hurt anyone in my life.

18:45.999 --> 18:47.416
And I'm an orthodontist.

18:48.210 --> 18:49.710
Wow.

18:49.920 --> 18:53.506
You know, you were right.
I mean, I thought we were happy.

18:53.715 --> 18:54.757
We weren't happy.

18:56.426 --> 18:58.261
But with Mindy...

18:59.138 --> 19:00.847
...now I'm happy.

19:02.182 --> 19:03.307
- Spit.
- What?

19:03.517 --> 19:05.268
Me.

19:07.104 --> 19:09.480
Anyway, um...

19:10.482 --> 19:13.860
I guess, uh... I guess this belongs to you.

19:15.028 --> 19:17.488
And thank you for giving it to me.

19:18.115 --> 19:20.533
Well, thank you for giving it back.

19:24.037 --> 19:25.746
Hello.

19:29.042 --> 19:31.085
Oh, please. What's wrong with Helen?

19:31.295 --> 19:32.420
Helen Geller?

19:33.797 --> 19:37.216
- I don't think so.
- Hello, it's not gonna be Helen Geller.

19:37.426 --> 19:38.801
Thank you.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.761
No. I mean, it's not Geller.

19:41.597 --> 19:43.055
What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?

19:43.765 --> 19:48.936
No, actually, um, we talked about
Helen Willick Bunch.

19:50.147 --> 19:52.773
Well, wait a minute.
Why is she in the title?

19:52.983 --> 19:54.358
Because it's my baby too.

19:54.568 --> 19:57.862
That's funny. Really? I don't remember
you making any sperm.

20:00.574 --> 20:03.159
And we all know what
a challenge that is.

20:03.368 --> 20:05.203
- Uh-huh. See?
- All right, you two, stop it.

20:05.412 --> 20:07.747
No, no. She gets a credit.
Hey, I'm in there too.

20:07.956 --> 20:11.918
Honestly. You're not actually suggesting
Helen Willick Bunch Geller.

20:12.127 --> 20:13.711
I think that borders on child abuse.

20:13.921 --> 20:17.715
Of course not.
I'm suggesting Geller Willick Bunch.

20:17.925 --> 20:20.384
Oh, no. No, no, no.
You see what he's doing?

20:20.594 --> 20:22.428
He knows no one
is gonna say all those names.

20:22.638 --> 20:25.264
He knows they'll wind up calling her Geller.
Then he gets his way.

20:25.474 --> 20:27.683
My way? You think this is my way?

20:27.893 --> 20:31.437
Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined
this moment in my life being...

20:31.647 --> 20:34.857
...this is not my way. You know what?
This is too hard.

20:35.067 --> 20:38.069
Knock, knock.
How are we today? Any nausea?

20:38.278 --> 20:40.154
- A little.
- Just a little.

20:41.949 --> 20:46.577
Well, I was just wondering about the
mother-to-be, but, uh, thanks for sharing.

20:46.787 --> 20:47.870
Uh, lie back.

20:48.664 --> 20:50.289
You know what? I'm gonna go.

20:50.499 --> 20:54.502
Um, I don't think I can be involved
in this particular family thing.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.348
Oh, my God.

21:07.557 --> 21:08.641
Look at that.

21:08.850 --> 21:10.309
I know.

21:21.071 --> 21:23.364
Well, isn't that amazing?

21:26.785 --> 21:28.494
What are we supposed
to be seeing here?

21:30.330 --> 21:34.208
I don't know, but I think it's about
to attack the Enterprise.

21:38.255 --> 21:41.173
You know, if you tilt your head
to the left and relax your eyes...

21:41.383 --> 21:43.634
...it kind of looks like an old potato.

21:44.761 --> 21:47.054
Then don't do that, all right?

21:49.224 --> 21:50.474
Monica?

21:50.684 --> 21:52.226
What do you think?

21:52.436 --> 21:53.894
Mm-hm.

21:55.063 --> 21:56.522
Are you welling up?

21:56.732 --> 21:57.982
- No.
- You are.

21:58.191 --> 22:00.443
- You are. You're welling up.
- No, I'm not.

22:00.652 --> 22:03.779
- You're gonna be an aunt.
- Oh, shut up.

22:04.948 --> 22:06.407
Hi, Mindy.

22:06.616 --> 22:08.701
Hi, it's Rachel.

22:08.910 --> 22:12.705
Yeah, I'm fine. I saw Barry today.

22:12.914 --> 22:14.582
Oh, yeah, yeah, he told me.

22:14.791 --> 22:17.501
No, it's okay. Really, it's okay.

22:17.711 --> 22:21.380
I hope you two are very happy.
I really do.

22:21.590 --> 22:24.759
And, Min, you know,
if everything works out...

22:24.968 --> 22:29.096
...and you guys end up getting
married and having kids and everything...

22:29.306 --> 22:32.683
...I just hope they have his
old hairline and your old nose.

22:37.731 --> 22:40.983
Okay, I know it was a cheap shot,
but I feel so much better now.
