Rel <i>is taped in front</i>
<i>of a live studio audience.</i>

00:04.336 --> 00:06.671
Oh, this the part right here.

00:06.672 --> 00:08.272
Here we go.

00:08.273 --> 00:11.909
My billionaire girlfriend is...
she's gone, and...

00:11.910 --> 00:15.313
now I got to go back to a life
of just turning tricks.

00:15.314 --> 00:17.381
Mm, mm, mm.

00:17.382 --> 00:19.183
I guess that's just the life of a...

00:20.486 --> 00:23.321
...pretty man.

00:23.322 --> 00:25.523
Male sex?

00:25.524 --> 00:27.658
Anyone want some male sex?

00:29.528 --> 00:31.729
I'll take some male sex.

00:31.730 --> 00:35.233
Gloria! You came back.

00:35.234 --> 00:38.336
Yes. Yes, I did. I did come back.

00:38.337 --> 00:40.171
Oh, Gloria.

00:40.172 --> 00:43.074
What are you waiting for? Come on.

00:43.075 --> 00:45.309
Take the leap.

00:45.310 --> 00:47.345
You mean the leap of love?

00:47.346 --> 00:48.880
Yes.

00:48.881 --> 00:50.948
Here we go.

01:01.627 --> 01:03.628
Okay, this is stupid.

01:03.629 --> 01:05.763
Why is Paul Melvins
your favorite actor?

01:05.764 --> 01:09.000
I mean he does some of the
corniest movies I've ever seen.

01:09.001 --> 01:10.568
He jumped through a moonroof.

01:10.569 --> 01:13.070
Both of his legs should be broken.

01:13.071 --> 01:15.406
What you don't get is the...

01:15.407 --> 01:18.275
the legs represent the power of love.

01:19.211 --> 01:21.178
Also, nobody I know

01:21.179 --> 01:23.414
has ever been told "I love you"
from a balcony.

01:23.415 --> 01:25.216
Look, that's because you don't
know anybody with a balcony.

01:25.217 --> 01:26.784
Okay? And I'm not gonna let you
keep talking

01:26.785 --> 01:28.185
about Paul Melvins like that.

01:28.186 --> 01:30.221
That dude is
a theatrical genius, okay?

01:30.222 --> 01:31.789
I put him up there
with Sidney Poitier,

01:31.790 --> 01:33.124
uh, Denzel Washington,

01:33.125 --> 01:34.725
uh, uh, uh, uh... Tyrese Gibson.

01:36.695 --> 01:38.095
Hey, listen, the point is

01:38.096 --> 01:40.097
none of this ever happens
in real life.

01:40.098 --> 01:41.866
Ain't no happily-ever-afters.

01:41.867 --> 01:43.234
It takes somebody like you

01:43.235 --> 01:44.735
to say that, because you've never been

01:44.736 --> 01:46.516
in a relationship
longer than three months.

01:47.272 --> 01:49.206
And that was too long.

01:49.207 --> 01:50.575
And the only reason why it lasted

01:50.576 --> 01:52.810
is because we had jury duty together.

01:52.811 --> 01:56.113
That's exactly why Paul Melvins
movies go over your head.

01:56.114 --> 01:59.216
Rel, these corny-ass movies
are making you too sentimental.

01:59.217 --> 02:01.118
You need to find a girl to smash.

02:01.119 --> 02:02.553
Look, I'm not like that, okay?

02:02.554 --> 02:03.921
I can't just sleep with any woman.

02:03.922 --> 02:05.322
I'm not a slut.

02:07.259 --> 02:09.926
First of all, you don't got
to say it like that.

02:09.928 --> 02:13.397
Ain't nothing wrong with having
enjoyable and uncommitted sex.

02:13.398 --> 02:15.900
I'm telling you, it'll stop you
from killing people.

02:17.135 --> 02:18.936
You know what?

02:18.937 --> 02:20.571
Instead of banning assault weapons,

02:20.572 --> 02:22.340
they should have
government-funded hoes

02:22.341 --> 02:24.575
who just go around,
and they should just be...

02:24.576 --> 02:27.845
Okay, no. L-L-Look, look, look...

02:27.846 --> 02:30.715
Brittany, I don't have time
for one of your weird theories.

02:30.716 --> 02:32.316
Look, I want a connection.

02:32.317 --> 02:34.285
I-I want a soul mate and...

02:34.286 --> 02:35.519
Look, everybody can't be like you.

02:35.520 --> 02:36.954
I mean,

02:36.955 --> 02:38.823
you treat all dudes
you mess with like dogs.

02:38.824 --> 02:40.124
That's not true.

02:40.125 --> 02:43.127
People love and trust their dogs, Rel.

02:43.128 --> 02:45.630
Now, look, sex is just sex sometimes.

02:45.631 --> 02:47.632
That's all it is,
and that's all you need.

02:47.633 --> 02:49.834
Look, I don't know
if you know this.

02:49.835 --> 02:51.635
I ain't even told nobody this, okay?

02:54.873 --> 02:57.608
I ain't been with nobody
since Shannon left.

02:57.609 --> 02:59.543
Everybody know that.

03:01.480 --> 03:05.383
Listen, Rel, you need some ass
to get over ass. All right?

03:05.384 --> 03:07.284
Right now, your body is in a place

03:07.285 --> 03:09.720
where you're physically
just stuck on one person,

03:09.721 --> 03:12.690
and you need to shock
your system with new ass.

03:12.691 --> 03:15.192
God, I don't know, man.

03:15.193 --> 03:17.962
Like, I don't want to get back
with my wife or nothing,

03:17.963 --> 03:20.398
you know, but I really
don't want to close that door.

03:20.399 --> 03:22.566
And if I...
if I sleep with another woman,

03:22.567 --> 03:25.036
it'll just make me feel like
the marriage is actually over.

03:25.037 --> 03:27.405
Dude, your marriage was over

03:27.406 --> 03:29.206
when your wife cheated on you.

03:29.207 --> 03:32.209
Your marriage was over
when she took the kids to Ohio.

03:32.210 --> 03:34.045
Your marriage was over when she...

03:34.046 --> 03:35.546
Look, I don't need a third one,

03:35.547 --> 03:37.314
'cause the first two
was pretty damn good.

- What are you talking about?

03:55.567 --> 03:57.268
Come on, man. You're alone at the bar.

03:57.269 --> 03:59.336
That's creeping 101. I know the game.

03:59.337 --> 04:00.871
You trying to get laid tonight.

04:00.872 --> 04:03.941
No, man. I don't think
I'm ready yet, man.

04:03.942 --> 04:05.443
I understand.

04:05.444 --> 04:07.344
But, yo, what about
this girl right here?

04:10.582 --> 04:12.349
I mean, she decent, but...

04:12.350 --> 04:14.852
she got balls
on the back of her socks.

04:16.254 --> 04:18.789
Oh, what about shorty right here?

04:19.925 --> 04:21.192
That ain't no shorty, man.

04:21.192 --> 04:23.060
That's my friend's mama.

04:24.563 --> 04:25.896
Oh, yeah.

04:25.897 --> 04:27.698
- What about her?
- Oh.

04:27.699 --> 04:29.333
Okay.

04:30.302 --> 04:32.403
Aw, damn it.

04:33.638 --> 04:36.774
She got a long-ass purse strap, man.

04:36.775 --> 04:40.277
Like her purse got a seat belt.

04:40.278 --> 04:42.313
Look, if you're gonna have
all these specific requirements,

04:42.314 --> 04:44.849
man, you're gonna have
to try online dating.

04:44.850 --> 04:46.550
Look, man,
there's no romance in that, man

04:46.551 --> 04:48.419
You can't get a woman's essence
through an app.

04:48.420 --> 04:50.421
- You know, it's just pictures.
- Nah.

04:50.422 --> 04:53.190
I'm on this app right now
called Phone Pheromones.

04:53.191 --> 04:54.759
- What?
- Yeah.

04:54.760 --> 04:56.494
You pick your date by a scent profile.

04:56.495 --> 04:58.629
I set mine to cheese scents, right,

04:58.630 --> 05:00.431
but I think I did it wrong, though.

05:00.432 --> 05:03.167
I thought I was gonna get a girl
that likes cheese like I do.

05:03.168 --> 05:04.468
- Mm-hmm.
- They sent me

05:04.469 --> 05:07.037
a chick that smells like cheese.

05:08.507 --> 05:09.974
You know, I hit it once or twice,

05:09.975 --> 05:11.809
but, you know,
I can't be wifing a chick

05:11.810 --> 05:14.612
that smell like Gouda.

05:14.613 --> 05:15.980
Look, see, that's what I'm saying.

05:15.981 --> 05:17.648
That's not for me, bro. I...

05:17.649 --> 05:19.016
I need a connection, man.

05:19.017 --> 05:20.584
I-I don't want to just be
with some random person.

05:20.585 --> 05:22.586
You know, if I met
the perfect woman right now,

05:22.587 --> 05:24.321
I would be so happy.

05:24.322 --> 05:26.056
I'd be out the game, you know?

05:26.057 --> 05:27.525
Uh, hey.

05:27.526 --> 05:29.326
Is that lemon drop for me?

05:29.327 --> 05:30.995
No.

05:30.996 --> 05:32.997
It's my... it's my drink.
I bought it with my money.

05:32.998 --> 05:35.032
You just walked in here.
I don't know how you think...

05:35.033 --> 05:37.067
You know, I mean, like...

05:37.068 --> 05:39.203
Oh, you were kidding.

05:39.204 --> 05:40.604
- Right.
- I didn't know that...

05:40.605 --> 05:42.473
- that was a joke. I mean...
- Right. It was..

05:42.474 --> 05:44.175
I'm sorry. That-that was funny.
My-my bad.

05:44.176 --> 05:46.010
- It's okay.
- But, um...

05:46.011 --> 05:48.445
I don't want to give you this.
I've been drinking out of it.

05:48.446 --> 05:50.481
Can I buy you your own lemon drop?

05:50.482 --> 05:51.882
- Oh, I'd love that.
- Jake, could you...

05:51.883 --> 05:54.518
- could you get, uh... What's your name?
- Charlene.

05:54.519 --> 05:56.009
Could you get Charlene a-a lemon drop?

05:56.010 --> 05:57.199
All right. Cool.

05:57.200 --> 05:59.155
Hey, Charlene. I'm-I'm Rel.
Nice to meet you.

05:59.156 --> 06:00.256
Hey.

06:02.661 --> 06:04.161
I'm telling you.

06:04.162 --> 06:05.496
Okay, look, I-I got one for you.

06:05.497 --> 06:07.231
- Okay, this-this a real one, too.
- Okay. All right.

06:07.232 --> 06:10.467
Now, who's your favorite
all-time white Bulls player?

06:10.468 --> 06:12.369
- You ready? One...
- Yep.

06:12.370 --> 06:14.738
Two, three.

06:14.739 --> 06:16.307
- Jud Buechler.
- Jud Buechler. All righty.

06:16.308 --> 06:17.908
Girl...

06:17.909 --> 06:20.211
This is... I ain't gonna lie...
this is crazy to me.

06:20.212 --> 06:22.213
- You know what I mean?
- I know.

06:22.214 --> 06:24.381
- Mm.
- Mm.

06:24.382 --> 06:26.717
Ooh.

06:26.718 --> 06:30.154
Ugh, I hate women
that wear long purse straps.

06:30.155 --> 06:30.751
Huh.

06:30.752 --> 06:32.523
You're just asking for
somebody to snatch it.

06:32.524 --> 06:36.093
See, long purse straps are
my number one pet peeve.

06:36.094 --> 06:38.062
Tell me more.

06:39.931 --> 06:42.700
- It's so fun.
- It is.

06:42.701 --> 06:45.569
- It's been a good night.
- I know. And the thing...

06:45.570 --> 06:48.772
I think he wants us to leave.

06:48.773 --> 06:50.708
No, we should be...

06:50.709 --> 06:52.910
Damn, Jake. All right,
we'll get out of here. Uh...

06:54.012 --> 06:55.412
Hey, are-are you hungry?

06:55.413 --> 06:57.147
You want to come get
a "guy-ro" with me?

06:57.148 --> 06:59.250
Ooh, yes. And thank you
for saying "guy-ro."

06:59.251 --> 07:01.285
'Cause I hate when people say "gyro."

07:01.286 --> 07:03.287
- Me, too. "Gyro."
- Or "yer..." Whatever.

07:03.288 --> 07:05.477
All right, be safe, playboy.
You, too, sweetie.

07:05.478 --> 07:06.223
All right.

07:06.224 --> 07:09.526
Selfish bastards.

07:09.527 --> 07:12.229
Mmm...

07:17.769 --> 07:19.570
Mm. Hmm?

07:19.571 --> 07:22.539
Mm. Mm.

07:24.743 --> 07:27.044
♪

07:31.249 --> 07:33.250
Wow, this is...

07:33.251 --> 07:35.252
this is unbelievable, man.

07:35.253 --> 07:37.288
It feels like we're in
a real-life Paul Melvins movie.

07:37.289 --> 07:39.390
Hmm. Yeah, if Paul Melvins

07:39.391 --> 07:42.259
was ten times as handsome.

07:42.260 --> 07:44.461
Girl, I don't know
what you're trying to get,

07:44.462 --> 07:47.331
- but you're gonna get it.
- About time.

07:47.332 --> 07:49.934
Let's go back to your place.

07:49.935 --> 07:51.869
You-you want to go back to my place?

07:51.870 --> 07:53.604
Oh, yeah.

07:53.605 --> 07:56.240
Shibbity damn dobos.

08:03.949 --> 08:06.784
That was just what I needed.

08:13.158 --> 08:15.159
- Oh...
- I know. I mean...

08:15.160 --> 08:17.649
I didn't know I could
still do all that.

08:18.496 --> 08:21.131
Ah. You know something?
It was magical.

08:21.132 --> 08:22.466
You know why?

08:22.467 --> 08:23.701
- Why?
- Because I'm with you.

08:23.702 --> 08:25.769
Oh, that's so sweet.

08:25.770 --> 08:27.271
Thank you.

08:29.040 --> 08:31.342
You know something? We should do this.

08:31.343 --> 08:33.510
We just did.

08:33.510 --> 08:35.645
No, no, no, no, no.
Come here. I'm serious.

08:35.647 --> 08:38.448
Like... this should be a thing.

08:38.450 --> 08:41.418
Like, this should be
something special.

08:41.419 --> 08:43.386
- Mmm.
- Hmm?

08:44.289 --> 08:45.489
Boop.

09:02.574 --> 09:04.341
Hey, baby.

09:13.385 --> 09:15.886
Uh, Charlene?

09:15.887 --> 09:18.188
Charlene?

09:20.892 --> 09:22.759
Charlene?

09:23.695 --> 09:25.696
Charlene?

09:28.767 --> 09:31.268
Soul mate? Where you at, baby?

09:31.269 --> 09:34.004
You in the kitchen
making me some coffee?

09:35.373 --> 09:37.007
Charlene.

09:39.611 --> 09:40.978
Charlene?

09:42.180 --> 09:44.114
Charlene

09:44.115 --> 09:46.483
Soul mate?

09:50.215 --> 09:52.472
Look it just doesn't make
sense why she would leave.

09:52.473 --> 09:54.007
That was... that was both of our

09:54.008 --> 09:56.009
best night of our lives, you know?

09:57.359 --> 09:59.526
Wait a minute. What if she went out

09:59.527 --> 10:01.962
to get us some breakfast biscuits...

10:01.963 --> 10:05.566
and she got kidnapped, man?

10:05.567 --> 10:07.268
You better hope that didn't happen,

10:07.269 --> 10:09.069
'cause you don't want
to be a black man

10:09.070 --> 10:11.071
that was the last person
to see a woman alive.

10:11.072 --> 10:13.607
Well, should I call
the police or something?

10:13.608 --> 10:15.709
Man, police can't help you. Oh.

10:15.710 --> 10:18.612
But you can call Liam Neeson,
'cause your girl been <i>Taken.</i>

10:18.613 --> 10:21.882
See, Dad, you got to stop
joking around, man.

10:21.883 --> 10:23.651
Me and Charlene really connected.

10:23.652 --> 10:26.287
Like, like, we held each other
in... in each other's arms,

10:26.288 --> 10:28.088
and... and she booped me.

10:29.257 --> 10:31.659
What the hell is a "boop"?

10:31.660 --> 10:33.260
You know, it's...

10:33.261 --> 10:34.561
Boop.

10:34.562 --> 10:36.230
- Hey, don't touch me there!
- See...?

10:40.035 --> 10:41.802
You see what I'm saying?

10:41.803 --> 10:43.270
That-that-that...
that's what I'm talking about.

10:43.271 --> 10:44.972
You see how intimate that is?

10:44.973 --> 10:47.241
Man, look, I don't know
what happened that night, but...

10:47.242 --> 10:49.777
okay, look on the good side...
at least you got some sex,

10:49.778 --> 10:52.413
and you didn't get robbed.

10:52.414 --> 10:54.748
See, see, Dad, it's more
than sex, you know what I mean?

10:54.749 --> 10:56.817
And her not robbing me
should prove that even further.

10:56.818 --> 10:59.653
Well... I wish I was in your shoes,

10:59.654 --> 11:01.155
you know what I'm saying?

11:01.156 --> 11:04.258
Your wife is just separated from you.

11:04.259 --> 11:05.993
My wife is dead.

11:05.994 --> 11:08.128
She's up in Heaven looking down at me,

11:08.129 --> 11:10.631
watching my every move, spying on me.

11:10.632 --> 11:13.100
Okay, full disclosure.

11:13.101 --> 11:15.502
In a moment of weakness,
I tried to hook up

11:15.503 --> 11:17.705
- with Veronica from the dry cleaners...
- Wait.

11:17.706 --> 11:19.173
You're talking
about Veronica with the...

11:19.174 --> 11:22.309
Yeah, yeah,
that's why I tried to hook up.

11:22.310 --> 11:24.712
So, I got back to her place, you
know, and I'm not feeling good

11:24.713 --> 11:26.447
about myself, but I'm there,
and she said,

11:26.448 --> 11:28.382
"Can I go to the bathroom
and put on something sexy?"

11:28.383 --> 11:30.351
So I'm waiting, and lights
start flickering, man,

11:30.352 --> 11:32.853
so I said, that's your mama
trying to tell me to go.

11:32.854 --> 11:34.087
So I got out.

11:35.323 --> 11:37.424
Thank God you're here.

11:38.626 --> 11:41.128
Congratulations, Rel. You smashed.

11:41.129 --> 11:43.497
Hey, no, no, no, Brittany,

11:43.498 --> 11:44.965
I didn't smash.

11:44.966 --> 11:47.301
Me and Charlene made love,
you know, and...

11:47.302 --> 11:49.470
and I woke up, and she was gone.

11:49.471 --> 11:51.839
Oh, you mean, like, a one-night stand?

11:51.840 --> 11:54.706
It's okay. Life is not
a Paul Melvins movie.

11:54.707 --> 11:56.874
- It was just sex. That's all right.
- No, no, no, no, no.

11:56.875 --> 11:58.710
We had a real connection, man.

11:58.711 --> 12:00.078
It felt like we had potential

12:00.079 --> 12:02.313
to be the next, you know, Jay and Bey.

12:02.314 --> 12:04.048
- No, no, you mean Jay and Bee.
- No, no.

12:04.049 --> 12:05.550
I said "Jay and Bey,"
'cause it's B-E-Y." It's a "Y"

12:05.551 --> 12:07.218
at the end of the "Bey."
You know what I mean?

12:07.219 --> 12:08.486
So what you're saying is,
it's the Bey-Hive

12:08.487 --> 12:09.554
- and Queen Bey.
- No, no, no.

12:09.555 --> 12:10.788
We got a Queen Bee already.

12:10.789 --> 12:12.023
- It's Lil' Kim, okay?
- No, if you take...

12:12.024 --> 12:14.525
No, that's
beside the point! Okay?

12:14.526 --> 12:16.027
We got to find Charlene.

12:16.028 --> 12:18.362
Okay, well, did you check
her social media?

12:18.363 --> 12:20.198
Do you know her last name?

12:20.199 --> 12:23.000
Yeah, Charlene...

12:23.001 --> 12:24.402
something.

12:24.403 --> 12:26.671
Rel, she didn't give you
her last name?

12:26.672 --> 12:28.206
That says it all, man.

12:28.207 --> 12:30.908
No, no. See, names are overrated.

12:30.909 --> 12:32.510
Okay?

12:32.511 --> 12:34.345
Did Romeo and Juliet have last names?

12:34.346 --> 12:36.380
Yes.

12:36.381 --> 12:39.784
Their last names
was the whole problem.

12:39.785 --> 12:41.919
You know, you know
something, screw this, man.

12:41.920 --> 12:45.423
Look, I'm-I'm-a... I'm-a
go find her, y'all, and, look...

12:45.424 --> 12:49.160
if Romeo and Juliet could
make it, me and Charlene can.

12:52.564 --> 12:54.065
Refresh my memory.

12:54.066 --> 12:57.201
What happened at the end
of <i>Romeo and Juliet?</i>

12:57.202 --> 12:59.403
She takes fake poison.

12:59.404 --> 13:02.440
He finds her dead, thinks she's
really dead, but she ain't.

13:02.441 --> 13:05.743
So he takes real poison,
and he really dies.

13:05.744 --> 13:09.347
So she wake up, see him dead,
stabs herself to death.

13:09.348 --> 13:11.349
White kids.

13:17.790 --> 13:19.924
Okay, look, she-she was
about this tall, right,

13:19.925 --> 13:21.459
and-and she had on this shirt

13:21.460 --> 13:23.294
that complemented
her brown eyes, and her eyes

13:23.295 --> 13:25.029
had little speckles of hazel in 'em.

13:25.030 --> 13:26.497
Specks of hazel?

13:26.498 --> 13:28.933
She might be sick, man.
Be careful out there.

13:28.934 --> 13:31.102
Jake, she's not sick, okay?

13:31.103 --> 13:33.104
That was just her essence...
it's purple

13:33.105 --> 13:35.807
like the majestic African queen
she descends from.

13:35.808 --> 13:40.244
Nah, man, I ain't seen
no purple bitches up in here.

13:43.816 --> 13:45.983
Look, man, thanks for stopping.
Uh, I don't know if you

13:45.984 --> 13:48.252
remember me from last night.
Uh, I was with a beautiful girl.

13:48.253 --> 13:50.655
- We rode in your cab?
- Oh, I know. I remember thinking,

13:50.656 --> 13:52.657
"What is she doing with him?"

13:52.658 --> 13:55.760
- Okay, so you know her?
- Oh, yeah. Charlene.

13:55.761 --> 13:58.296
Brother, that is perfect, man.
Just give me her address.

13:58.297 --> 13:59.730
Nah, man.

13:59.731 --> 14:02.400
My days of helping stalkers are over.

14:02.401 --> 14:04.202
What are you talking about?
I'm not a stalker.

14:04.203 --> 14:05.937
Yeah, that's what they all say.

14:05.938 --> 14:07.338
What you mean,
"That's what they all say"?

14:07.339 --> 14:08.806
No, no. I'm serious.
I'm not a stalk...

14:08.807 --> 14:10.408
Can-can I at least get
her building number?

14:10.409 --> 14:12.143
I'll just wait in the bushes
till she come out.

14:12.144 --> 14:13.444
Sounds stalky.

14:13.445 --> 14:15.246
It's not! Shoot.

14:16.348 --> 14:17.615
Here you go, man.

14:17.616 --> 14:19.283
Can I help you?

14:19.284 --> 14:21.018
Listen, man, I was here last night

14:21.019 --> 14:23.621
with the woman of my dreams,
and she... she actually paid

14:23.622 --> 14:26.290
with a credit card. Is there
any way I could get her receipt?

14:26.291 --> 14:28.659
Wait. So you made the woman
of your dreams pay for dinner?

14:28.660 --> 14:31.229
Uh, yes, because she wanted to.

14:31.230 --> 14:34.165
But, look,
all I need is her last name.

14:34.166 --> 14:35.666
Listen, man, I don't know what they do

14:35.667 --> 14:37.301
with the receipts around here, man.

14:37.302 --> 14:39.036
They just started letting me
work at this register,

14:39.037 --> 14:41.339
and I've been here for five years.

14:41.340 --> 14:43.841
Oh. What about one of these
cameras, man? Like, is there

14:43.842 --> 14:45.473
any way we could look at
the footage and maybe zoom down

14:45.474 --> 14:47.378
at the receipt and then...
and actually get her name?

14:47.379 --> 14:48.813
Man, those cameras don't work.

14:48.814 --> 14:50.214
My boss just put 'em there
to stop crime.

14:50.215 --> 14:52.350
They ain't even pointing at nothing.

14:55.888 --> 14:58.122
Okay, sorry about that, brother.

14:58.123 --> 15:00.291
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:03.886 --> 15:06.741
Man, I'm all out of
ideas, I'm out of leads.

15:06.742 --> 15:08.276
I don't know what to do, man.

15:08.277 --> 15:09.677
All I know is that Charlene...

15:09.678 --> 15:11.679
Charlene's still got my heart, yo.

15:13.110 --> 15:14.877
Oh, Charlene.

15:16.747 --> 15:18.915
Charlene!

15:18.916 --> 15:20.692
I miss you so much!

15:20.693 --> 15:23.228
It was a one-night stand.
Shut up!

15:23.229 --> 15:25.664
You know something, man?
Mind your own damn business.

15:25.665 --> 15:28.299
You don't know my life. You shut up!

15:29.745 --> 15:31.803
Rel, everybody's gonna know your life

15:31.804 --> 15:33.705
if you keep yelling out
the damn window!

15:33.706 --> 15:35.440
Man!

15:37.143 --> 15:39.144
Hello?

15:39.145 --> 15:40.679
Hey, Rel, man, she's here.

15:40.680 --> 15:42.614
- Who?
- The girl.

15:42.615 --> 15:45.717
The girl. The purple chick
with the African essence.

15:45.718 --> 15:47.485
I knew I'd find her.

15:47.486 --> 15:49.421
Yeah, technically, I found her.

15:49.422 --> 15:51.356
Okay, look, just keep her there, man.

15:51.357 --> 15:53.258
I'll be on... right on my way, okay?

15:53.259 --> 15:54.726
All right.

15:58.464 --> 16:00.932
- Guess what, huh?
- What?

16:00.933 --> 16:03.234
Charlene has been found. That's right.

16:03.235 --> 16:05.670
Uh-huh. Love wins, Brittany.

16:12.044 --> 16:14.979
Why does he keep leaving me
alone in his apartment?

16:18.851 --> 16:20.952
Hey, where is she?

16:21.887 --> 16:23.321
Oh-ho.

16:23.322 --> 16:25.490
Prepare to get your
heart strings played, brother.

16:27.293 --> 16:28.927
See what we got here.

16:28.928 --> 16:30.628
Oh.

16:32.932 --> 16:34.299
♪ Yeah ♪

16:35.634 --> 16:38.436
♪ Yeah, yeah ♪

16:38.437 --> 16:40.905
♪ Now that we've found love ♪

16:40.906 --> 16:43.375
♪ What are we gonna do? ♪

16:43.376 --> 16:45.610
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

16:45.611 --> 16:47.545
Now that we've found love,
what we gonna

16:47.546 --> 16:49.280
- boop about it?
- Ooh!

16:51.117 --> 16:53.785
Uh, hey, Rel, I'm gonna just say...

16:53.786 --> 16:55.420
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

16:55.421 --> 16:58.156
Stop right there, baby. Look, um,

16:58.157 --> 17:00.625
I know you probably think I'm
like the other guys, you know,

17:00.626 --> 17:02.260
who only think
about just sleeping with you.

17:02.261 --> 17:03.795
No, that's not my M.O., you know.

17:03.796 --> 17:07.365
I really believe that we, uh...
we're soul mates.

17:07.366 --> 17:09.401
Whoa.

17:09.402 --> 17:11.502
Rel, look, um...

17:11.503 --> 17:14.638
I had a real great time
with you last night,

17:14.640 --> 17:18.276
but if I can be honest, I kind
of wanted it to be just that...

17:18.277 --> 17:20.145
last night.

17:20.146 --> 17:23.147
I mean, I feel like, um...
I just... I feel like

17:23.148 --> 17:25.316
we had, like, this really
deep connection. I mean...

17:25.317 --> 17:27.685
we took a pedicab ride, and...

17:27.685 --> 17:29.788
- we ate "guy-ros" together, and...
- That was fun.

17:29.789 --> 17:32.323
You know, I genuinely loved
all of those things,

17:32.324 --> 17:34.325
but that's not all that I am.

17:34.326 --> 17:36.161
I hope it's not all you are.

17:36.162 --> 17:41.166
Last night was magical,
but in a way where two strangers

17:41.167 --> 17:44.169
just get caught up
in genuine attraction.

17:44.170 --> 17:46.771
It was a one-night relationship,

17:46.772 --> 17:48.740
but a beautiful one.

17:48.741 --> 17:51.009
I mean...

17:51.010 --> 17:52.944
- It was something about...
- I know.

17:56.315 --> 17:58.316
Where your glasses at?

17:58.317 --> 18:01.319
Oh, I don't wear those every day.

18:01.320 --> 18:03.955
I mean, that was just a fashion thing.

18:03.956 --> 18:06.157
I got 20/20.

18:06.158 --> 18:07.725
Huh?

18:07.726 --> 18:09.360
You know, but I had fun.

18:09.361 --> 18:11.229
You know, maybe we could... do this...

18:11.230 --> 18:14.899
So... you don't need glasses?

18:14.900 --> 18:16.401
No.

18:16.402 --> 18:17.836
So you just...

18:17.837 --> 18:19.304
you just wear it as a fashion thing?

18:19.305 --> 18:20.738
Right.

18:20.739 --> 18:22.373
You can actually see?

18:22.374 --> 18:23.908
- Right.
- Wow.

18:23.909 --> 18:25.977
Do you got a blinged-out
wheelchair somewhere, too,

18:25.978 --> 18:29.414
or... a decorative asthma pump?

18:29.415 --> 18:31.549
- Wait. What?
- How do I say this?

18:31.550 --> 18:35.220
Um... this is wrong.

18:35.221 --> 18:36.888
Let me tell you something.

18:36.889 --> 18:39.190
Growing up, the trauma I went through

18:39.191 --> 18:40.925
for wearing glasses
is ridiculous, okay?

18:40.926 --> 18:42.694
You didn't get called
"four-eyes," okay?'

18:42.695 --> 18:44.262
Nobody called you a librarian.
Nobody mistaked you

18:44.263 --> 18:45.763
for a substitute teacher,
they coming to your desk

18:45.764 --> 18:47.131
to sign their name for attendance.

18:47.132 --> 18:48.566
- Okay. Okay, Rel.
- Huh?

18:48.567 --> 18:50.268
I think you're overreacting.
Let me just go.

18:50.269 --> 18:52.270
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, I'm not overreacting.

18:52.271 --> 18:54.873
All right. Bye, Rel.

18:54.874 --> 18:57.041
Should be ashamed of yourself.

18:57.042 --> 18:58.543
I'm not.

19:06.151 --> 19:08.052
♪ Now that we found love ♪

19:08.053 --> 19:09.921
♪ What are we gonna do with it? ♪

19:09.922 --> 19:11.055
Lemon drop?

19:12.892 --> 19:15.026
You know something, man?

19:15.027 --> 19:16.761
I just...

19:16.762 --> 19:19.063
Maybe I made too much
of a big deal out of it.

19:19.064 --> 19:20.698
At the end of the day,
I didn't even know

19:20.699 --> 19:22.467
who she really was, you know?

19:22.468 --> 19:25.370
But... honestly, you know,
shibbity dobos.

19:26.772 --> 19:29.240
I had a great time.

19:29.241 --> 19:32.143
What makes me feel
even better is that...

19:32.144 --> 19:35.280
my best friend loves me enough
to come check on me.

19:35.281 --> 19:37.115
Oh, no.

19:37.116 --> 19:39.017
I'm actually here waiting
for one of my dips.

19:44.223 --> 19:45.623
Ready to get up out of here, Brittany?

19:45.624 --> 19:47.725
I am.

19:55.501 --> 19:58.503
This is...

19:59.965 --> 20:03.167
Oh, God. This is, uh...

20:03.168 --> 20:04.936
I'm at a loss for words.

20:04.937 --> 20:08.606
I mean, you know, who would've
thought for <i>Pretty Man,</i>

20:08.607 --> 20:12.477
I would win Best Leading Actor
playing a male prostitute?

20:12.478 --> 20:15.179
Which I'm actually...
I really was a male prostitute,

20:15.180 --> 20:19.050
and it's very unique that, uh,
you would give someone

20:19.051 --> 20:21.986
who's actually
the character they played

20:21.987 --> 20:24.021
the award for Best Leading Actor.

20:24.022 --> 20:26.891
Uh, first, I would like to thank, um...

20:26.892 --> 20:29.360
and this is unusual... my pimp.

20:29.361 --> 20:33.397
Uh, Marvin, thank you so much
for the training,

20:33.398 --> 20:37.001
the slaps, the, uh...

20:37.002 --> 20:42.840
the abuse that prepared me to
really dive into this character

20:42.841 --> 20:46.511
and make people
all over America relate

20:46.512 --> 20:49.514
to a male prostitute and his struggle.

20:49.515 --> 20:52.083
Uh, I would also like to thank my,

20:52.084 --> 20:54.552
uh, parents, who I never knew.

20:54.553 --> 20:56.821
This is why I, you know,
jumped into prostitution,

20:56.822 --> 20:59.590
because, uh, I raised myself
on the streets,

20:59.591 --> 21:02.493
and that's where
I was found by the pimp

21:02.494 --> 21:06.531
who pretty much raised me
and had me selling my body.

21:06.532 --> 21:08.399
Um... I also...

21:08.400 --> 21:11.002
Wait. Hey! No.

21:11.003 --> 21:13.070
Hey, no, you're not
gonna play me off here.

21:13.071 --> 21:14.906
No, no. No, I'm not done yet!

21:14.907 --> 21:17.608
Look, look, Richard Dreyfuss
was up here for 45 minutes,

21:17.609 --> 21:20.011
and no one said anything, okay?

21:20.012 --> 21:21.612
Okay, damn it, I'm getting this out.

21:21.613 --> 21:25.549
As soon as a black man
wins an award, you...
