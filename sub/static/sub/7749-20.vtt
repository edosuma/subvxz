00:18.810 --> 00:21.415
(camera shutters clicking)

00:21.450 --> 00:23.611
(low, indistinct chattering)

00:30.360 --> 00:32.590
(camera shutters continue
clicking)

00:39.200 --> 00:41.634
(low, indistinct chattering
continues)

00:46.510 --> 00:48.478
Good morning.

00:48.510 --> 00:52.071
An hour ago, I withdrew my name
from contention

00:52.120 --> 00:54.509
for the office
of State's Attorney.

00:54.550 --> 00:57.348
I did so with great regret

00:57.390 --> 00:59.483
but also with a deep conviction

00:59.520 --> 01:04.253
that neither I, nor anyone
associated with my campaign,

01:04.290 --> 01:08.454
was responsible for tampering
with voting machines.

01:08.500 --> 01:11.628
But a partial recount
of select precincts

01:11.670 --> 01:13.535
has led me to believe

01:13.570 --> 01:17.563
that it is detrimental
to the democratic process

01:17.610 --> 01:20.272
for Cook County to be subjected

01:20.310 --> 01:23.677
to a long and drawn-out recount.

01:23.710 --> 01:26.645
I would like to thank

01:26.680 --> 01:29.581
my supporters
for their faith in me

01:29.620 --> 01:32.657
and my husband, who has been...

01:32.690 --> 01:35.284
(choking up):
has been amazing
during this difficult time.

01:35.320 --> 01:36.628
Thank you.

01:36.660 --> 01:38.355
(reporters clamoring)

01:38.390 --> 01:39.823
Mr. Florrick! Mr. Florrick!
Over here! Mr. Florrick!

01:39.860 --> 01:41.452
REPORTERS:
Mr. Governor!

01:41.500 --> 01:43.661
(clamoring)

01:47.740 --> 01:50.106
(clamoring continues)

01:58.650 --> 02:02.518
What do I do now?

02:07.620 --> 02:09.850
MAN:
Mrs. Nolfi.

02:09.890 --> 02:13.451
I find that the State has proved
their case against you,

02:13.500 --> 02:16.469
and as a result,
I must find you guilty.

02:16.500 --> 02:19.936
I do wish I had some discretion
as to a sentence,

02:19.970 --> 02:22.564
but the number of pills
in your possession

02:22.610 --> 02:26.398
triggered what is called
a mandatory minimum sentence

02:26.440 --> 02:28.806
of six to 30 years.

02:28.840 --> 02:32.810
I do not believe you
deserve such a sentence,

02:32.850 --> 02:34.647
but I am
handcuffed.

02:34.680 --> 02:37.478
However, there are
still 48 hours

02:37.520 --> 02:39.249
until the sentence
must be Imposed.

02:39.290 --> 02:40.757
If you can
bring me evidence

02:40.790 --> 02:43.588
that will allow me_to
reVISIt your conVIctIon,

02:43.630 --> 02:44.949
I will
gladly do so.

02:44.990 --> 02:46.526
(gavelbangs)

02:46.560 --> 02:50.599
REESE:
Mandatory minimum sentencing.

02:50.630 --> 02:52.791
That's why I brought you four
here together today.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.967
Jim, Bob,

02:55.000 --> 02:57.605
just 'cause you're two
of the most conservative lavwers

02:57.640 --> 03:00.609
I ever met doesn't mean_
you get to tease Cary and Diane

03:00.640 --> 03:03.279
about their backward
liberal ways. Anyway,

03:03.310 --> 03:06.279
this is one area where our
political philosophies overlap.

03:06.320 --> 03:09.539
Liberals think
that mandatory minimums

03:09.590 --> 03:11.808
are draconian and unfair.
We think

03:11.850 --> 03:13.681
they're wasteful and unfair.
Either way, we agree:

03:13.720 --> 03:14.812
a policy
that's failed.

03:14.860 --> 03:16.828
Are we agreed
on the test case?

03:16.860 --> 03:18.782
CARY:
Yes, sir. Steven Mercurio.

03:18.830 --> 03:20.559
House painter.

03:20.600 --> 03:23.524
He became addicted to
painkillers after back surgery,

03:23.570 --> 03:26.232
gave some to a friend who turned
out to be an undercover cop.

03:26.270 --> 03:28.431
His mandatory
sentence: 12 years.

03:28.470 --> 03:31.564
Jim, Bob, we agreed on this?

03:31.610 --> 03:33.601
For an extra
$200 an hour,

03:33.640 --> 03:36.245
you can actually get 'em
to speak.
(chuckling)

03:36.280 --> 03:39.841
I think we should
conSIder someone else.

03:39.880 --> 03:43.646
Well, a divide in the liberal
caucus. What a surprise.

03:43.690 --> 03:46.488
Louise Nolfi,
a 62-year-old grandmother.

03:46.520 --> 03:49.284
She delivered a package
to the post office.

03:49.330 --> 03:51.651
A drug-sniffing dog
alerted to it.

03:51.690 --> 03:53.954
They opened the package
and found 26 tablets

03:54.000 --> 03:56.491
of MDMA, Ecstasy,

03:56.530 --> 03:58.828
a six-year
mandatory minimum.
Where's the file?

03:58.870 --> 04:00.690
Oh, I don't have one.
I just came from court.

04:00.740 --> 04:03.629
You've got a demo problem.

04:03.670 --> 04:06.833
Jailed grandmothers,
people can pity.

04:06.880 --> 04:09.007
Jailed white guys,

04:09.040 --> 04:11.577
people
can identify.

04:11.610 --> 04:13.339
The house painter, I think.

04:16.080 --> 04:18.981
R.D.

04:19.020 --> 04:20.885
Meet her first.
Why?

04:20.920 --> 04:22.729
You should have all the facts.

04:22.760 --> 04:25.524
Meeting grandmothers
isn't facts.

04:25.560 --> 04:27.755
It's manipulative kitsch.
And you know it.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.688
Then why not
meet her?

04:29.730 --> 04:32.836
You're gonna defend her
either way, aren't you?

04:32.870 --> 04:34.895
Yes.

04:34.940 --> 04:37.761
The soft-hearted liberal
in her natural habitat.

04:37.810 --> 04:40.005
Ms. Lockhart,
Alicia's here.

04:43.880 --> 04:45.973
(indistinct chatter)
(phone rings)

04:46.010 --> 04:47.773
WOMAN:
Lockhart, Agos & Lee.

04:47.820 --> 04:49.310
How may I direct your call?

04:52.620 --> 04:54.781
(quietly): Alicia's here.
I didn't know
she was coming back.

04:57.590 --> 04:59.592
CARY:
Hey, Alicia.

05:01.560 --> 05:04.427
DIANE:
I'm so sorry
about everything.

05:04.470 --> 05:06.859
Thank you.

05:09.570 --> 05:12.676
Come on. They're waiting.

05:13.710 --> 05:16.702
Water?
Thank you.

05:18.850 --> 05:22.980
So-- thank you--

05:23.020 --> 05:26.808
Alicia and I have been
talking, as most of you know.

05:26.860 --> 05:29.010
And I called her right
after her... announcement.

05:29.060 --> 05:31.085
DAVID: I wish you
hadn't backed down,

05:31.130 --> 05:33.451
Alicia.
Thank you, David.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.752
And we've talked about it
internally here, too, and...

05:35.800 --> 05:37.859
well...
(chuckles)
(chuckles)

05:37.900 --> 05:40.596
We want you to come back
as name partner.

05:42.140 --> 05:44.734
(inhales sharply, chuckles)

05:46.840 --> 05:49.707
And, um...

05:49.750 --> 05:51.900
you're not worried about my...

05:51.950 --> 05:53.508
skuaﬁon?

05:53.550 --> 05:55.745
CARY: What, a voter fraud
scandal? You mean,

05:55.780 --> 05:57.418
after I almost went to jail
for six years?

05:57.450 --> 05:59.987
(chuckles)

06:00.020 --> 06:02.887
What about you, David?
Do you agree with this?

06:02.930 --> 06:05.490
I agree with anything
that maintains stability.

06:05.530 --> 06:07.122
DIANE:
Kalinda and I are
having some troubles

06:07.160 --> 06:09.390
with the State's Attorney's
Office.

06:09.430 --> 06:10.863
We're dealing
with it.
And...

06:10.900 --> 06:12.868
my exit package,
we already negotiated it.

06:12.900 --> 06:15.391
Bring your lawyer back in,
and we'll figure it out.

06:15.440 --> 06:17.032
This is home, Alicia.

06:17.070 --> 06:18.606
Welcome home.

06:20.440 --> 06:22.908
Thank you.

06:22.950 --> 06:25.145
(phones ringing,
indistinct chatter)

06:46.170 --> 06:47.899
(line ringing)

06:47.940 --> 06:50.067
Geneva Pine.
It's Cary.

06:50.110 --> 06:52.169
What can I do for you?

06:52.210 --> 06:55.031
I've thought it over,
and I'll do it.

06:55.080 --> 06:57.048
Do what?

06:57.080 --> 06:59.048
Turn evidence against Bishop.

06:59.080 --> 07:01.469
What evidence, Cary?

07:03.550 --> 07:04.983
I'll only do it
if I have your guarantee

07:05.020 --> 07:06.658
you'll drop the charges
against Kalinda and Diane.

07:06.690 --> 07:07.952
Okay.

07:10.130 --> 07:12.155
Give me a day
to get some ducks in a row,

07:12.190 --> 07:14.829
and I'll get back to you.

07:16.130 --> 07:18.792
Odd how things turn out.

07:18.830 --> 07:20.639
A month ago, no one wanted
to turn on Bishop.

07:22.070 --> 07:24.106
That was Cary.

07:24.140 --> 07:27.109
What do you need from me?
Evidence

07:27.140 --> 07:30.109
on Bishop's drug operation,
his subsidiary businesses,

07:30.150 --> 07:31.777
all illegal activities.

07:31.810 --> 07:34.176
Look, I won't testify.

07:34.220 --> 07:36.643
Get me something
I can use independently

07:36.690 --> 07:38.544
and you won't need
to testify.

07:38.590 --> 07:41.013
You can't make a deal with Cary.

07:41.060 --> 07:43.483
I told him I needed a day.

07:43.530 --> 07:45.828
Get me something before then.

07:45.860 --> 07:46.849
NOLFI:
I'm not gonna talk

07:46.900 --> 07:48.788
about my grandson.

07:48.830 --> 07:51.196
He's turning his life around.
I know,
Mrs. Nolfi.

07:51.230 --> 07:55.690
The truth is, the judge is
sympathetic with your situation,

07:55.740 --> 07:58.868
but we need to give him a reason
to overturn your verdict.

07:58.910 --> 08:01.504
Have you talked
to your public defender?

08:01.540 --> 08:04.509
Mr. Bollinger? No. Why?

08:04.550 --> 08:06.518
Well, the judge may be angry
with Mr. Bollinger

08:06.550 --> 08:08.211
for not doing a better job.

08:08.250 --> 08:10.810
We can overturn the verdict by
arguing ineffective assistance.

08:10.850 --> 08:12.750
I don't want
to get him in trouble.

08:12.790 --> 08:14.280
He's such a lovely man.

08:14.320 --> 08:16.754
He won't get
into trouble,

08:16.790 --> 08:17.882
but let me talk to him.

08:17.930 --> 08:19.818
A'I'I'ICUS FINCH:
Now, gentlemen...

08:20.860 --> 08:23.590
...in this country,

08:23.630 --> 08:26.997
our courts
are the great levelers.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.702
And in our courts,

08:29.740 --> 08:33.005
all men are... created...

08:33.040 --> 08:34.735
equaL

08:34.780 --> 08:36.839
So is this what made you want
to become a lawyer?

08:36.880 --> 08:38.973
No.

08:39.010 --> 08:40.978
It made a lot of...

08:41.020 --> 08:42.817
people at school want
to become lawyers,

08:42.850 --> 08:47.253
but they're all... prosecutors
and tax lawyers now.

08:47.290 --> 08:49.827
...reality.
GRACE: I like when people
give speeches, and it makes

08:49.860 --> 08:51.179
other people change
their mind.

08:51.230 --> 08:52.549
I know. Me, too.

08:52.600 --> 08:53.828
Do you ever get to do that?

08:53.860 --> 08:55.259
In court?

08:55.300 --> 08:56.858
No.

08:56.900 --> 08:59.892
It's mostly about facts
and evidence.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.567
Most of the time

09:01.600 --> 09:03.636
you don't really have someone
you believe in.

09:03.670 --> 09:06.878
That's
too bad.

09:06.910 --> 09:08.775
Maybe it'll be different
this time.

09:08.810 --> 09:10.641
What do you mean?

09:10.680 --> 09:12.045
I'm going back to the law ﬁrm.

09:12.080 --> 09:13.274
What?
(chuckles)

09:13.320 --> 09:15.618
That's great.

09:15.650 --> 09:16.878
That's great.

09:16.920 --> 09:20.185
In the name of God...

09:20.220 --> 09:22.780
do your duty.

09:22.830 --> 09:24.024
(phone ringing)

09:24.060 --> 09:25.857
Um, do you want me
to pause it?

09:25.890 --> 09:28.154
No. I know
how it ends.

09:31.230 --> 09:32.936
Mr. Gallagher, hello.

09:32.970 --> 09:34.767
Thank you for returning my call.

09:34.800 --> 09:37.735
I know you were wondering if
I was heading back to my firm,

09:37.770 --> 09:38.930
and it looks like I am.

09:38.970 --> 09:40.631
You are? You're going back now?

09:40.680 --> 09:41.874
Yes. Definitely.

09:41.910 --> 09:43.878
But I just got a call
from Lockhart/Agos

09:43.910 --> 09:45.377
saying you weren't going back.

09:45.410 --> 09:46.775
Oh, well, that's a mistake.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.947
Uh, it-it must be
an old message.

09:48.980 --> 09:52.655
No, I just got it an hour ago.

09:52.690 --> 09:53.657
From who? David Lee?

09:53.690 --> 09:55.954
No, Diane Lockhart.

09:55.990 --> 09:58.288
You...

09:58.330 --> 10:00.127
Diane called you?

10:00.160 --> 10:02.048
Yeah, she was worried
I would leave the firm,

10:02.100 --> 10:04.068
and I told her
I was keeping my options open.

10:04.100 --> 10:06.967
So she asked me to hold off
on calling you for a day or two.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.798
That surprised me,
so I'm calling you now.

10:09.840 --> 10:12.001
Uh, Mr. Gallagher, I'm gonna...

10:12.040 --> 10:13.837
have to get back to you, okay?

10:13.880 --> 10:15.871
Of course.

10:19.010 --> 10:21.649
Damn it.

10:32.730 --> 10:33.628
They had no intention
of bringing me back.

10:33.660 --> 10:36.766
They never did.
They have been playing out

10:36.800 --> 10:37.869
this charade so they can
cherry-pick my clients.

10:37.900 --> 10:40.164
Well, even if they are,
you can't make it personal.

10:40.200 --> 10:41.838
Sure, I can.
I started that firm.

10:41.870 --> 10:43.303
Here. In my home.

10:43.340 --> 10:45.160
We had so few outlets,

10:46.780 --> 10:48.133
Then hit 'em back.
Florrick-Agos--

10:48.180 --> 10:50.148
or whatever
they're called now--

10:50.180 --> 10:52.205
they're not the only game
in town. You have other options.

10:52.250 --> 10:54.912
I'm officially
a scandal, Peter.

10:54.950 --> 10:56.747
You should know that
better than anyone.

10:56.790 --> 10:59.111
No one wants a sullied lawyer.
They want a
good lavwer,

10:59.150 --> 11:02.756
and you have enough clients
to go on your own.

11:02.790 --> 11:04.781
(heavy sigh)

11:04.830 --> 11:06.798
I'm just tired, Peter.

11:06.830 --> 11:08.798
All right,
answer me this.

11:08.830 --> 11:10.422
If you went solo,

11:10.470 --> 11:13.166
how many of your
clients would follow?

11:13.200 --> 11:15.191
I don't know.

11:15.240 --> 11:17.037
Maybe 20.
Well, that's

11:17.070 --> 11:18.867
a pretty good book of business
for day one.

11:18.910 --> 11:22.073
Where would I even get
the seed money?
Your exit package.

11:22.110 --> 11:23.975
Go back in there...

11:24.010 --> 11:26.399
make as if nothing's wrong,
just be all smiles,

11:26.450 --> 11:29.419
and then get them to rip up
your exit package.

11:29.450 --> 11:32.146
You lost a lot of money
on that package, right?

11:32.190 --> 11:34.078
Hmm?

11:36.390 --> 11:38.858
(hip-hop music playing)

11:38.890 --> 11:40.118
Kalinda.

11:40.160 --> 11:41.889
Dex.

11:41.930 --> 11:43.158
What do you want?

11:43.200 --> 11:45.361
Did you know that Bishop's
leaving the business?

11:45.400 --> 11:47.368
What business?

11:47.400 --> 11:50.107
(siren wailing in distance)

11:50.140 --> 11:52.233
He's, uh...

11:52.270 --> 11:53.373
he's worried
about being betrayed,

11:53.410 --> 11:55.230
so he's turning
evidence.

11:55.280 --> 11:56.838
Where'd you hear that?

11:56.880 --> 11:58.472
Geneva Pine.
The ASA?

11:58.510 --> 12:00.375
(scoffs)
She's playing you.

12:00.420 --> 12:03.116
He's doing it
for Dylan.

12:03.150 --> 12:06.210
Wants to stay out of jail
so he can be a dad.

12:06.250 --> 12:08.059
Look, Pine says
there's room

12:08.090 --> 12:09.819
for only one person
to turn evidence.

12:09.860 --> 12:11.885
You need to get out of my car.

12:11.930 --> 12:14.228
I came to you
because I want to keep my job.

12:14.260 --> 12:15.522
Bishop goes...

12:15.560 --> 12:17.289
you'll be number one.

12:17.330 --> 12:18.888
*

12:18.930 --> 12:21.797
Hey. If this is some
type of a loyalty test

12:21.840 --> 12:24.900
from Bishop, you tell him
I said to kiss my ass.

12:24.940 --> 12:27.204
I would never turn on him, ever.

12:36.420 --> 12:40.151
Thank you for taking the time
to listen to our concerns.

12:40.190 --> 12:41.953
No problem--
that's why we're here.

12:41.990 --> 12:43.423
And thank you
for listening
to our concerns.

12:43.460 --> 12:45.257
No problem. Happy
to accommodate.

12:45.290 --> 12:48.157
So you would like to renegotiate
your exit package?

12:48.200 --> 12:50.418
Mm, no,
not renegotiate; rescind.

12:50.470 --> 12:53.234
Ah. Meaning what?
Meaning: since
I am returning,

12:53.270 --> 12:56.467
it seems more sensible
to just...

12:56.500 --> 12:58.309
void it.
Like Alicia
never left.

12:58.340 --> 13:00.171
Well, the issue, of course--

13:00.210 --> 13:02.201
and it's an
unfortunate one--

13:02.240 --> 13:04.401
is that Alicia's equity
is already settled out.

13:04.450 --> 13:06.247
Mm, on the cheap.

13:06.280 --> 13:08.214
Which was understandable
at the time, but Alicia's

13:08.250 --> 13:10.889
going to need to be
made whole again
if she returns,

13:10.920 --> 13:12.080
and rather
than waste time

13:12.120 --> 13:13.951
restoring the
status quo,

13:13.990 --> 13:16.481
_ it makes more sense
just to keep the status quo,

13:16.520 --> 13:17.919
don't you think?

13:17.960 --> 13:20.258
Well, Alicia, I think
all David is saying

13:20.300 --> 13:22.256
is this proposal
is a bit of a curveball.

13:22.300 --> 13:24.894
More of a slider, I'd say--
give us a couple of swings,

13:24.930 --> 13:26.124
you can probably still hit it.

13:26.170 --> 13:28.388
No problem.
Take all the time you need.

13:28.440 --> 13:30.260
Alicia...

13:30.310 --> 13:33.302
I didn't believe it before,
but I think you're right--

13:33.340 --> 13:35.501
they're playing you.
Why do you think that?

13:35.540 --> 13:37.201
Because they
should've just said no

13:37.250 --> 13:38.239
to rescinding
your exit package,

13:38.280 --> 13:39.872
but they delayed.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.876
They're stalling you.
To get my clients?

13:41.920 --> 13:43.239
Mm-hmm.

13:43.290 --> 13:44.939
So what do I do?

13:44.990 --> 13:46.241
Start working the phones fast.

13:46.290 --> 13:49.612
Get your clients on board
before they do, because...

13:49.660 --> 13:52.254
they don't want you back.

13:52.290 --> 13:54.429
We want her back, David.
Yes, but if we

13:54.460 --> 13:57.520
tear up her exit contract,
she gets all her power back.

13:57.570 --> 14:00.368
First-tier equity package,
a seat on the...

14:00.400 --> 14:02.061
CARY:
What difference does it make?

14:02.100 --> 14:04.534
We want her back.
Yes, but on our
terms, not hers.

14:04.570 --> 14:06.060
She's a founding member
of this firm.

14:06.110 --> 14:07.509
I say we swallow the cost.
And I say

14:07.540 --> 14:10.247
you two are burning money
out of a misguided sense

14:10.280 --> 14:11.975
of loyalty.
Let's at least run it

14:12.010 --> 14:13.875
by the finance committee.
DIANE:
Fine.

14:13.920 --> 14:15.911
_ But let's_ start _
calling back AIICIa's clients,

14:15.950 --> 14:17.918
assuring them she's staying.

14:17.950 --> 14:20.555
I'm afraid Alicia might get
the wrong idea if she heard

14:20.590 --> 14:23.229
that we were
calling them before.

14:23.260 --> 14:25.080
You have been
a public defender

14:25.130 --> 14:27.155
for less than a year,
Mr. Bollinger?

14:27.200 --> 14:28.428
Yeah. Ten months.

14:28.460 --> 14:29.552
Oops. Sorry.

14:29.600 --> 14:31.989
I see. And, um...

14:32.030 --> 14:35.636
So how _famili_ar_
are you With Illin0is
criminal procedure?

14:35.670 --> 14:38.468
I've been getting up to speed.
It's complicated, though.

14:39.410 --> 14:40.900
Looking
for Louise's file.

14:40.940 --> 14:42.339
Oh, here it is.

14:42.380 --> 14:44.473
Uh... sorry about
the mustard stain.

14:44.510 --> 14:47.343
So, um...

14:47.380 --> 14:50.042
you made the decision
not to take issue

14:50.090 --> 14:53.253
with the prosecution's charge
of intent to distribute?
Oh, that's right.

14:53.290 --> 14:55.485
Yeah, there's video evidence
of her mailing a package

14:55.520 --> 14:57.579
with 26 tabs of Ecstasy.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.191
Yeah, that's the way
Justice Ginsburg liked them.

15:04.230 --> 15:06.266
Justice Ginsburg?

15:06.300 --> 15:08.461
As in, um...
The Supreme
Court justice.

15:08.500 --> 15:10.104
Yeah. I clerked with her
for a year

15:10.140 --> 15:11.164
before joining
the Justice Department.

15:12.470 --> 15:14.279
Look, I-I think
you're going

15:14.310 --> 15:15.572
to have a hard time proving

15:15.610 --> 15:17.305
ineffective assistance,
unfortunately.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.341
I mean, that's what
you're going for, right?

15:19.380 --> 15:21.519
I'm incompetent?
No hard feelings, but yeah.

15:21.550 --> 15:23.438
I wish I could have
given you something,

15:23.490 --> 15:25.981
but unfortunately, I did
a pretty good job at trial.

15:26.020 --> 15:28.318
I mean, if she were
a regular street criminal,

15:28.360 --> 15:30.351
you could get her
into a probationary program

15:30.390 --> 15:32.358
like TASC.
For drug addicts?

15:32.390 --> 15:34.597
Right. She wouldn't
see a day of jail.

15:34.630 --> 15:37.326
It's odd-- her having never
used drugs is actually worse.

15:37.370 --> 15:40.396
She could get probation if you
could prove she's a drug addict.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.464
Unbelievable.
Yeah. I was
going to talk

15:41.500 --> 15:42.467
to her presentencing
officer

15:42.500 --> 15:44.229
about it...
That's a good idea.

15:44.270 --> 15:46.500
I will go do that.
Only in America, right?

15:46.540 --> 15:48.235
You know, you're
a grandma, go to jail.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.168
You're a drug addict,
go to rehab.

15:50.210 --> 15:52.508
You wonder why people like me
are into smaller government.

15:52.550 --> 15:54.245
Oh, yes, that's right--
smaller government

15:54.280 --> 15:55.713
would have no such ironies.

15:55.750 --> 15:58.048
Perhaps there'd be
smaller ironies.
Seriously?

15:58.090 --> 15:59.489
That's your experience
of life?

15:59.520 --> 16:01.283
Smaller things are purer?
It actually

16:01.320 --> 16:02.514
is my experience
of life, yeah.

16:02.560 --> 16:04.425
Do you want me to step out?
Stay put.

16:04.460 --> 16:06.121
What I find disgusting
is the Republicans

16:06.160 --> 16:07.525
will starve
a democracy of funds,

16:07.560 --> 16:10.461
and then complain
that society's dysfunctional.

16:10.500 --> 16:12.161
Nobody is starving anybody
of anything.

16:12.200 --> 16:15.738
Mr. Gallagher, I wanted
to get back to you first.

16:15.770 --> 16:18.432
Diane made a mistake yesterday.

16:18.470 --> 16:20.006
As it turns out...

16:20.040 --> 16:22.406
Alicia Florrick
is returning to the fold.

16:22.440 --> 16:24.647
Dear God, you all need
to get your stories straight.

16:24.680 --> 16:26.705
I have Alicia right now
on the other line,

16:26.750 --> 16:28.479
and she says
she's starting her own firm

16:28.520 --> 16:30.545
and she wants me
to come with her.

16:30.590 --> 16:32.239
Uh, Jim,

16:32.290 --> 16:34.656
can you give me a moment?

16:34.690 --> 16:36.112
(Diane speaking quietly)

16:36.160 --> 16:37.354
I'll check in with them.

16:37.390 --> 16:39.756
Oh. Uh, David,

16:39.790 --> 16:42.054
do you know Reese Dipple?
Only by reputation.

16:42.100 --> 16:43.567
David Lee,
family law.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.727
Very nice to
meet you, sir.
Call me R.D.

16:45.770 --> 16:47.692
R.D. Simple,
American.

16:47.740 --> 16:49.731
I'm a conservative,
too, sir.

16:49.770 --> 16:51.032
Really?

16:52.070 --> 16:53.731
Yes. Diane,
do you have a minute?

16:54.780 --> 16:56.736
Alicia's playing us.

16:56.780 --> 16:59.601
What do you mean?
She's on the phone,
as we speak,

16:59.650 --> 17:01.675
trying to steal
James Gallagher away.

17:01.720 --> 17:04.280
She's starting
her own firm. Again.

17:04.320 --> 17:06.709
She's dragging this out
so we won't pursue her clients.

17:06.750 --> 17:08.718
Meanwhile, she's
locking them down.

17:08.760 --> 17:11.752
Then why would she insist
on voiding her exit package?
For money.

17:11.790 --> 17:13.724
So she _doesn't have
to renegotiate her contract

17:13.760 --> 17:15.489
with a gun to her head.

17:15.530 --> 17:17.828
Gallagher just called me--
I got him on hold.

17:17.870 --> 17:19.599
While he's got her on hold.

17:19.630 --> 17:20.494
Uh, Cary.

17:21.240 --> 17:22.332
We need a minute.

17:22.370 --> 17:24.600
Jim, uh, I have
Cary Agos

17:24.640 --> 17:26.699
and Diane Lockhart
here with me.

17:26.740 --> 17:28.537
We just want
to reiterate

17:28.580 --> 17:30.548
how much your business
means to us.

17:30.580 --> 17:32.502
I appreciate that,
but I just want

17:32.550 --> 17:33.847
some stability,
do you understand?
Mr. Gallagher,

17:33.880 --> 17:36.519
you say you have Alicia
on the other line right now?

17:36.550 --> 17:39.189
Yep.
Why don't you tell her
you'll get back to her,

17:39.220 --> 17:40.756
and we will resolve this
shortly.

17:40.790 --> 17:43.156
Fine. But I got to tell you,
this is starting to get old.

17:48.260 --> 17:50.364
I don't believe it.
That's because the last time

17:50.400 --> 17:52.288
she pulled this crap,
you were on her side.

17:52.330 --> 17:53.866
You really want
to get into this now?

17:53.900 --> 17:55.390
Stop it.
Stop. Alicia's watching.

18:00.880 --> 18:03.474
(rapid beeping)

18:04.910 --> 18:05.842
Dad?

18:05.880 --> 18:07.245
Mr. Bishop?

18:07.280 --> 18:08.713
He must be up.

18:08.750 --> 18:10.479
(beeping stops)

18:10.520 --> 18:13.455
I'll, uh, wait in the
car till he gets back.

18:37.180 --> 18:39.205
(typing)

18:51.490 --> 18:52.787
(typing)

19:05.640 --> 19:08.131
(dog barking in distance)

19:14.650 --> 19:16.174
(floorboards creaking)

19:16.220 --> 19:18.245
(violin playing scale)

19:18.290 --> 19:21.157
(violin continues playing scale)

19:29.860 --> 19:32.624
(violin continues playing scale)

19:35.470 --> 19:38.462
(violin playing exercise)

19:44.480 --> 19:46.641
(door opens)

19:48.880 --> 19:52.281
(violin continues
playing exercise)

19:53.660 --> 19:54.888
Dylan?

19:54.920 --> 19:56.512
(violin stops)
Up here.

19:59.030 --> 20:02.625
(violin resumes
playing exercise)

20:10.770 --> 20:12.738
You're here.

20:12.770 --> 20:16.433
Yeah. I, uh... I didn't want
to leave Dylan alone.

20:16.480 --> 20:20.348
Actually, uh...
I'm surprised you weren't home.

20:20.380 --> 20:21.972
Why?
Nothing.

20:22.020 --> 20:23.988
I... I just saw Dexter
heading out--

20:24.020 --> 20:25.442
I figured you two were together.

20:25.490 --> 20:27.617
(violin continues in distance)

20:27.660 --> 20:29.616
Well, I'm here now.

20:29.660 --> 20:31.252
You can go.

20:31.290 --> 20:33.656
Thank you.

20:33.700 --> 20:35.656
Thanks, sir.

20:35.700 --> 20:38.999
(violin continues
playing exercise)

20:43.640 --> 20:45.528
(door closes)

20:45.570 --> 20:47.970
(violin continues in distance)

21:00.320 --> 21:01.412
Was Dylan downloading
music or something?

21:01.460 --> 21:02.916
No.
Somebody used
a flash drive

21:02.960 --> 21:06.851
to download files.

21:06.890 --> 21:08.721
Can you tell who?

21:08.760 --> 21:10.694
Every time a USB device
is connected to a computer,

21:10.730 --> 21:12.561
all the details--
the serial number,

21:12.600 --> 21:14.898
_ the class of device-_-
it's all stored in the registry.

21:14.940 --> 21:16.589
So you can trace it?

21:16.640 --> 21:18.437
Yes.

21:18.470 --> 21:20.631
(typing)

21:22.340 --> 21:24.308
DAVID:
She's stabbing us

21:24.350 --> 21:26.568
in the back.
We don't know
that yet.

21:26.610 --> 21:28.646
James Gallagher could just...
It's not
just Gallagher.

21:28.680 --> 21:30.784
I spoke with Paisley
and Tanya Page--

21:30.820 --> 21:32.913
she reached out
to both of them, too.

21:32.950 --> 21:34.656
Kalinda, you're
just gonna sit there?

21:34.690 --> 21:37.454
Yeah. Alicia
would never do this.

21:37.490 --> 21:39.458
She's already done it--
she did it last year,

21:39.490 --> 21:41.355
and she's doing it again.
CARY:
She had a reason

21:41.400 --> 21:43.823
to do it last year.
Oh, how does it
feel, Cary,

21:43.870 --> 21:46.361
to be betrayed...
David... David,
what do you suggest?

21:46.400 --> 21:48.960
That we play coy,
string her along in negotiations

21:49.000 --> 21:52.106
until we have a chance
to call the rest of her clients

21:52.140 --> 21:53.835
and convince them to stay.

21:55.110 --> 21:56.771
DYLAN:
Hey, Dad, I'm home.

21:56.810 --> 21:58.368
Is Kalinda with you?

21:58.410 --> 22:00.412
Uh, yes, sir.

22:00.450 --> 22:01.872
Do you have a minute?

22:01.920 --> 22:03.444
Hey, Jamir.

22:05.950 --> 22:07.850
Why don't you head upstairs?
I'll be right up.

22:07.890 --> 22:09.517
I got an "A" in algebra.

22:09.560 --> 22:11.551
I'm proud
of you.

22:16.860 --> 22:18.760
When you came to my house,

22:18.800 --> 22:20.768
did you go into my study?

22:20.800 --> 22:22.734
No.

22:22.770 --> 22:25.739
Did you log onto
my computer?

22:25.770 --> 22:27.806
No.

22:31.080 --> 22:33.719
You saw Dexter leaving
when you drove up.

22:35.920 --> 22:39.048
You said you saw Dexter leaving
here when you drove Dylan home.

22:39.090 --> 22:42.514
Look, uh, I don't want
to get anyone into trouble.

22:42.560 --> 22:44.721
Why would anybody
get into trouble?

22:46.530 --> 22:47.827
I don't know.

22:52.500 --> 22:54.968
Do you still
want me to stay, sir?

22:55.000 --> 22:56.991
Yes.

23:02.640 --> 23:04.608
(phone rings)

23:04.650 --> 23:06.470
Hey, boss.
What you need?

23:06.510 --> 23:07.772
Some information.

23:07.820 --> 23:09.617
Someone used a flash drive

23:09.650 --> 23:11.015
to download files
from my computer.

23:11.050 --> 23:12.540
Okay.

23:12.590 --> 23:14.558
Flash drives leave
their fingerprints

23:14.590 --> 23:17.479
behind.
Did you know that?

23:17.530 --> 23:18.656
No.

23:18.690 --> 23:20.157
I didn't either.

23:20.190 --> 23:22.192
This flash drive
was given the name

23:22.230 --> 23:25.063
"D.R.'s Jams #2".

23:26.870 --> 23:28.895
Uh, boss... I don't know.

23:28.940 --> 23:30.999
I mean, I keep
two flash drives in my car,

23:31.040 --> 23:32.860
but they have all my
music on 'em and...

23:32.910 --> 23:35.572
I didn't...
I mean, I would never...

23:35.610 --> 23:38.579
H-Hold on.

23:41.850 --> 23:44.512
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

23:44.550 --> 23:46.643
I think you should
come over here, Dex.

23:46.690 --> 23:47.759
Um...

23:47.790 --> 23:48.654
Dex.

23:48.690 --> 23:49.884
Um, I'll-I'll call you back.

23:49.920 --> 23:51.922
I'll call you back.

23:56.530 --> 23:58.521
Did you want anything
more from me, sir?

24:02.500 --> 24:05.003
No.
Maybe tomorrow.

24:05.040 --> 24:06.632
No problem.

24:09.240 --> 24:11.800
"D.R.'s Jams"?
Who's D.R.?

24:11.850 --> 24:13.078
Dexter Roja.

24:13.110 --> 24:14.577
Why do you have
his flash drive?

24:14.620 --> 24:16.019
I took it from his car.

24:16.050 --> 24:17.074
Why?

24:17.120 --> 24:19.839
You have everything
you need on that

24:19.890 --> 24:21.517
to take Bishop down.

24:21.560 --> 24:23.084
This doesn't
come back to me.

24:23.120 --> 24:26.089
And you leave Cary
and Diane out of it.

24:26.130 --> 24:27.995
(man speaks indistinctly
over P.A.)

24:28.030 --> 24:29.793
Um, I'm looking

24:29.830 --> 24:32.025
for the pre-sentence
officer on duty.

24:34.200 --> 24:36.998
Oh, thank you.

24:37.040 --> 24:39.201
Thank you so much.
Appreciate it.

24:41.980 --> 24:43.641
Oh.

24:43.680 --> 24:44.977
May I help you?

24:46.850 --> 24:48.772
I'm here for Louise Nolfi.
I'm her attorney.

24:48.820 --> 24:50.071
(phone rings)

24:50.120 --> 24:52.111
Oh. Joy.

24:54.120 --> 24:55.985
No.

24:56.020 --> 24:58.124
I told him
it's not true.

24:58.160 --> 25:01.027
Would you like me
to return?

25:01.060 --> 25:02.527
No. Sit.

25:02.560 --> 25:06.223
No. I have to go.
You tell him

25:06.270 --> 25:08.090
it's not true.

25:08.140 --> 25:10.836
All right?

25:11.910 --> 25:13.059
Now...

25:13.110 --> 25:15.169
Uh, it's Louise Nolfi.
N-O-L...

25:15.210 --> 25:17.906
Yeah, I know.

25:17.950 --> 25:19.906
You were Cary Agos'
attorney,

25:19.950 --> 25:21.918
weren't you?
I was.

25:21.950 --> 25:24.714
And Lemon Bishop's
lawyer, too.

25:24.750 --> 25:26.638
Yes.

25:27.920 --> 25:30.081
Okay, this is it.
Louise Nolfi.

25:30.120 --> 25:31.758
Uh...

25:31.790 --> 25:33.052
possession with intent.

25:33.090 --> 25:35.991
26 tablets of MDMA.

25:36.030 --> 25:37.258
Yes. Unfortunately
for this client,

25:37.300 --> 25:38.961
that's typical.
She's has

25:39.000 --> 25:41.230
quite a high tolerance.
Oh?

25:41.270 --> 25:43.295
That why I'm talking
to you and not her?

25:45.670 --> 25:47.900
Uh, well, Mrs. Nolfi has a...

25:47.940 --> 25:49.737
a serious issue.
No mention

25:49.780 --> 25:52.078
of any history of, uh,

25:52.110 --> 25:54.078
drug use here.
Well,

25:54.120 --> 25:55.849
no, it's not something
she advertises.

25:55.880 --> 25:57.745
She has children
and grandchildren.

25:57.790 --> 25:59.143
So how soon can she get here?

25:59.190 --> 26:00.817
I beg your pardon?
Drug addiction

26:00.860 --> 26:02.680
or not, I need

26:02.720 --> 26:05.826
to evaluate her before I make
a recommendation to the court.

26:05.860 --> 26:09.091
Does she really have to come in?

26:09.130 --> 26:10.791
Yeah.

26:13.330 --> 26:15.059
Well, how about tomorrow?

26:15.100 --> 26:16.863
It's unfortunate,
but this election scandal

26:16.900 --> 26:18.162
has tainted
the Florrick name.

26:18.210 --> 26:19.700
I'm afraid

26:19.740 --> 26:21.037
most judges would
find themselves

26:21.080 --> 26:22.172
biased against Alicia
right now.

26:22.210 --> 26:23.700
Oh, I know,

26:23.750 --> 26:25.047
those allegations
were terrible.

26:25.080 --> 26:28.379
Not to mention
those e-mails she sent.

26:28.420 --> 26:31.116
POLMAR:
So the payment schedule
of the exit agreement

26:31.150 --> 26:32.788
was tied to Alicia
taking office,

26:32.820 --> 26:34.685
but she never_
actually took office.

26:34.720 --> 26:37.018
Therefore the exit agreement
is, unfortunately,

26:37.060 --> 26:39.221
void on its face.
So, um, I'm sorry,

26:39.260 --> 26:40.796
where does that, uh,

26:40.830 --> 26:44.061
leave us?
It seems I'm still partner.

26:44.100 --> 26:46.796
Uh, forgive me, but I think
we're gonna need a minute

26:46.830 --> 26:48.138
to discuss this.
Mm-hmm.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.262
That bitch.

26:51.310 --> 26:53.198
She's right about
the exit deal.

26:53.240 --> 26:54.901
She never took office.
So

26:54.940 --> 26:56.737
tell her there's a new
capital call. All partners

26:56.780 --> 26:59.146
have to pony up an additional
$250,000 for improvements.

26:59.180 --> 27:01.148
(all clamoring)

27:01.180 --> 27:03.114
Oh, come on.

27:03.150 --> 27:05.015
It's a ploy,
you idiots.

27:06.990 --> 27:09.959
You know,
I almost admire her.

27:09.990 --> 27:11.958
We stall her_
to go after her clients,

27:11.990 --> 27:13.992
so she stalls us
to go after ours.

27:15.300 --> 27:17.256
(door closes)
DIANE:
How dare you?

27:17.300 --> 27:19.291
Going after
Reese Dipple?

27:19.330 --> 27:21.833
You've never even met him.

27:21.870 --> 27:23.804
_Excuse me?
DaVId's been on the
phone With every one

27:23.840 --> 27:25.000
of your old clients,
and they've

27:25.040 --> 27:26.200
all received calls from you.

27:26.240 --> 27:28.128
To tell them I'm coming back.

27:28.180 --> 27:29.272
No, to poach them.

27:31.010 --> 27:32.978
I'm sorry...

27:33.010 --> 27:36.275
are you really
accusing me of poaching?

27:36.320 --> 27:38.208
This whole negotiation
has been a charade.

27:38.250 --> 27:40.445
You had no intention
of bringing me back here.

27:40.490 --> 27:42.253
Because you betrayed us.
No, Diane,

27:42.290 --> 27:44.121
because you betrayed me.

27:45.390 --> 27:47.153
Get out of here, Alicia.

27:47.190 --> 27:48.691
Get out of here now.

27:58.410 --> 28:03.029
(knocking)

28:03.080 --> 28:06.208
Lemond Bishop. Chicago PD.
You're under arrest.

28:06.250 --> 28:08.445
You got to be kidding me, right?
With my son here?

28:08.480 --> 28:10.448
Turn around, please, sir.

28:10.480 --> 28:13.119
Dad.
I'm all right, Dylan.

28:13.150 --> 28:13.912
(handcuffs clicking)

28:13.960 --> 28:15.018
What do you want me to do,
Lemond?

28:15.060 --> 28:16.254
Call my lawyer.

28:16.290 --> 28:18.121
(quietly):
And tell Dexter he's dead.

28:18.160 --> 28:20.048
What is going on, Geneva?
What happened?

28:20.090 --> 28:22.149
Cary?
Yes, Cary.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.827
You were getting back to me.

28:23.870 --> 28:26.464
Now I hear Bishop was arrested.
What did you do?

28:26.500 --> 28:27.967
I found another way.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.729
You found another way
with Kalinda?

28:29.770 --> 28:32.102
Cary, just stay out of this.
This has nothing to do with you.

28:32.140 --> 28:33.698
You're gonna get her killed.

28:34.980 --> 28:37.437
It started after
my husband died.

28:37.480 --> 28:40.005
I got the shakes.

28:40.050 --> 28:42.769
You know,
my hands.

28:43.480 --> 28:45.311
I needed the drugs.
Um,

28:45.350 --> 28:47.181
wasn't money tight, Louise?

28:47.220 --> 28:50.087
Oh, yes. Oh, yeah.

28:50.120 --> 28:52.452
A friend gave me
a couple pills.

28:52.490 --> 28:55.994
Oxycodone. Row,

28:56.030 --> 28:58.999
I called them. That's
the street name.

28:59.030 --> 29:01.999
When I was on the street.

29:02.040 --> 29:05.362
I see. And where are you
getting your supply now?

29:05.410 --> 29:08.106
I have my man.

29:08.140 --> 29:11.348
Down the...

29:11.380 --> 29:13.075
On the street.

29:13.110 --> 29:15.169
The street where I live.

29:15.220 --> 29:17.848
Where my man gets me drugs.

29:17.890 --> 29:19.846
I need the drugs.

29:19.890 --> 29:22.518
Uh-huh. Do you
find that taking

29:22.560 --> 29:25.779
drugs helps you to avoid
or relieve, uh,

29:25.830 --> 29:27.286
withdrawal symptoms?

29:27.330 --> 29:29.798
Oh, yeah, all the time.

29:29.830 --> 29:32.196
I mean, sometimes
all I have is my high.

29:32.230 --> 29:33.959
Or I get
the shakes.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.434
The... You know.

29:36.470 --> 29:38.131
Okay, thank you,

29:38.170 --> 29:39.307
Ms. Nolfi.

29:39.340 --> 29:41.137
You're welcome.

29:41.180 --> 29:44.399
I mean, just so you know:

29:44.450 --> 29:47.271
I want to get this
horse off of my back.

29:51.290 --> 29:53.315
Monkey?

29:53.350 --> 29:54.317
What?

29:54.360 --> 29:57.158
Monkey off your back?

29:57.190 --> 29:59.158
No, horse.

29:59.190 --> 30:01.192
Yeah, horse.

30:08.500 --> 30:10.229
Okay, she's not a junkie.
She doesn't

30:10.270 --> 30:12.465
fit the clich, but...
I understand that

30:12.510 --> 30:15.229
mandatory minimums
are unfair, ma'am,

30:15.280 --> 30:16.975
but I cannot recommend

30:17.010 --> 30:19.570
that a non-addict
be put into rehab.

30:19.610 --> 30:21.441
I'm...

30:21.480 --> 30:23.880
sorry.

30:25.390 --> 30:28.018
(pounding on door)

30:30.960 --> 30:32.325
Where's Kalinda?

30:32.360 --> 30:33.622
She's not here.

30:33.660 --> 30:35.321
Well, I need
to leave a message.

30:35.360 --> 30:37.294
Someone turned on Bishop,
and it was not me.

30:37.330 --> 30:38.558
She needs to tell Bishop...

30:38.600 --> 30:40.568
It's not her either.

30:40.600 --> 30:42.363
What?

30:42.400 --> 30:44.937
Geneva Pine approached me
to turn evidence.

30:44.970 --> 30:47.302
Kalinda wasn't involved.
It was me.

30:49.310 --> 30:52.143
It was you?
How could it be you?

30:52.180 --> 30:54.978
I gave Pine what I knew.

30:57.550 --> 31:00.519
You did? You...

31:00.550 --> 31:02.256
She was in my car.

31:02.290 --> 31:03.882
Kalinda.

31:03.930 --> 31:05.420
She took it?

31:05.460 --> 31:07.428
Took what?

31:09.160 --> 31:10.650
I'm such an idiot.
The flash drive.

31:10.700 --> 31:12.361
She did this?
I don't know

31:12.400 --> 31:13.594
what you're talking about.
Tell Kalinda

31:13.630 --> 31:15.564
that I need to see her now.

31:15.600 --> 31:17.090
She has nothing to do with this.

31:17.140 --> 31:20.132
You tell her...
I need to see her.

31:27.180 --> 31:28.909
DIANE:
Listen to me, David.

31:28.950 --> 31:31.612
Alicia is still
a part of this firm.

31:31.650 --> 31:33.959
She was a partner
in another firm

31:33.990 --> 31:35.355
and she stole
how many clients?

31:36.660 --> 31:38.457
DAVID:
Uh, Chumhum

31:38.490 --> 31:41.152
ring a bell?
(line ringing)

31:41.200 --> 31:42.622
ALICIA:
Hello?

31:42.660 --> 31:45.561
Alicia? Uh, do you
have a minute?

31:45.600 --> 31:47.568
What, so Diane can
cut my exit package again?

31:47.600 --> 31:49.090
Alicia, what the hell's
going on?

31:49.140 --> 31:51.563
You tell me.
Diane and David Lee

31:51.610 --> 31:53.703
think you're
poaching clients.
They're the ones

31:53.740 --> 31:56.607
who've been stringing me along
for days, lying to my clients.

31:56.640 --> 31:59.677
No, no, they-they wanted
to bring you back, but then

31:59.710 --> 32:01.974
you called James Gallagher
and said you were leaving.

32:02.020 --> 32:03.578
No, no, no, no.

32:03.620 --> 32:04.985
He called me.

32:05.020 --> 32:07.716
Diane went behind my back
and told him

32:07.750 --> 32:10.719
I was out.
No, she didn't.

32:10.760 --> 32:12.523
Wait...

32:12.560 --> 32:14.323
when did Gallagher
say Diane called?

32:14.360 --> 32:15.657
Right after

32:15.700 --> 32:17.099
our meeting.
Alicia,

32:17.130 --> 32:18.688
Diane called _before
the meeting,

32:18.730 --> 32:20.618
before she even knew
you wanted to come back.

32:20.670 --> 32:22.433
I know 'cause I was there.

32:22.470 --> 32:24.506
She knew I was coming in.
Yes, but she didn't know

32:24.540 --> 32:26.531
why you were coming in.
Well, David Lee

32:26.570 --> 32:28.128
is calling my clients
right now.

32:28.180 --> 32:30.068
Because of you.
Because of what you did.

32:31.580 --> 32:33.548
So you're saying
this is a misunderstanding?

32:33.580 --> 32:35.343
I'm saying that you need

32:35.380 --> 32:38.349
to call Diane right now.

32:38.390 --> 32:40.381
(door opens)

32:42.220 --> 32:43.687
KALIN DA:
Hey.

32:43.720 --> 32:45.688
Hey.

32:45.730 --> 32:47.220
How long you been here?

32:47.260 --> 32:48.249
A few hours.

32:51.130 --> 32:54.065
Did you get
Bishop arrested?

32:54.100 --> 32:56.534
Cary, don't worry. I, uh...

32:56.570 --> 32:58.765
I handled it.

32:58.810 --> 33:00.766
So you're not
in trouble?

33:00.810 --> 33:03.005
No.

33:04.050 --> 33:06.041
Dexter Roja
was here.

33:08.580 --> 33:11.549
Wanted your help in figuring
out who turned on Bishop.

33:11.590 --> 33:14.559
Oh, that's good.

33:14.590 --> 33:16.558
I said it wasn't you.

33:16.590 --> 33:19.184
Said I was the one
who turned on Bishop.

33:21.530 --> 33:24.260
Wh... Why did you do that, Cary?

33:24.300 --> 33:26.291
Didn't want you
to get in trouble.

33:26.330 --> 33:28.730
I wasn't in trouble.

33:33.140 --> 33:36.268
He mentioned
a flash drive.

33:36.310 --> 33:38.449
He said he
just realized

33:38.480 --> 33:40.641
that you were the one
who took it from his car.

33:42.680 --> 33:45.319
What's going on, Kalinda?

33:48.420 --> 33:50.615
Nothing.

33:53.730 --> 33:55.823
I know_it's
something.

33:55.860 --> 33:58.499
When you talk that way,
it's always something.

34:00.470 --> 34:02.688
(zippering)

34:02.740 --> 34:06.107
No, no, I...
I can take care of it.

34:06.140 --> 34:08.779
You're in trouble.

34:08.810 --> 34:11.142
No.

34:11.180 --> 34:14.377
Can I help you? Please?

34:14.420 --> 34:17.776
No.

34:28.800 --> 34:31.121
(keys jingle)

34:31.730 --> 34:33.823
(door opens)

34:37.370 --> 34:39.201
Diane?

34:40.910 --> 34:43.538
Do you have a minute?
I think we need to talk.

34:45.210 --> 34:47.644
Yes, I think we do.

34:54.860 --> 34:57.488
(knocking)

35:00.190 --> 35:01.657
Hi.

35:01.700 --> 35:03.827
Grace. Hi.

35:03.860 --> 35:06.226
Is your mom in?

35:06.270 --> 35:08.659
Um, no, she stepped out.

35:08.700 --> 35:10.497
Uh, do you want me
to call her for you?

35:10.540 --> 35:13.509
No. Uh, I wanted to
talk to her in person.

35:13.540 --> 35:15.701
Um, can I get
you anything?

35:15.740 --> 35:18.846
Uh, no, thank you.

35:18.880 --> 35:20.404
Uh, please, have a seat.

35:20.450 --> 35:22.816
Thanks.

35:57.320 --> 36:00.881
(laughs)

36:02.860 --> 36:04.225
Smile.

36:04.260 --> 36:07.388
(Kalinda laughs)

36:07.430 --> 36:09.853
(camera shutter clicks)

36:15.670 --> 36:17.934
(phone ringing)

36:17.970 --> 36:20.666
Diane?

36:20.710 --> 36:22.769
I got your e-mail. What's up?

36:22.810 --> 36:26.940
Yeah, I, um... I took another
look at the lab report again.

36:26.980 --> 36:30.848
Louise Nolfi was caught
with 26 Ecstasy tablets,

36:30.880 --> 36:34.259
but the price attached
to the pills was $500.

36:34.290 --> 36:35.757
So?

36:35.790 --> 36:37.917
So, the street value
would be double that.

36:37.960 --> 36:39.882
Either someone's getting
a great deal,

36:39.930 --> 36:42.694
or there was a problem
with the amount of drugs.

36:42.730 --> 36:44.891
Interesting.
We'll talk to the lab tomorrow.

36:44.930 --> 36:48.491
Yeah, you need to call them
first thing in the morning.

36:48.540 --> 36:50.963
Uh, I-I won't be in.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.002
Are you all right?
KALINDA:
I'm fine.

36:53.040 --> 36:54.803
Did Alicia call you?

36:54.840 --> 36:56.535
No. She came in.

36:56.580 --> 36:58.775
We apologized to each other.

36:58.810 --> 37:01.278
I'm glad.

37:02.480 --> 37:04.846
Life's too short to be mad.

37:04.890 --> 37:06.949
Well, you're sounding
philosophical.

37:06.990 --> 37:08.685
Yeah.

37:08.720 --> 37:11.518
Um...

37:11.560 --> 37:13.778
I'll see you, Diane.

37:13.830 --> 37:15.354
(elevator bell dings)

37:15.400 --> 37:16.992
Are you sure you're all right?

37:17.030 --> 37:19.225
I'm fine.

37:20.500 --> 37:22.968
Take care of yourself, okay?

37:23.000 --> 37:25.366
You, too.

37:27.410 --> 37:28.968
(footsteps approaching)

37:29.010 --> 37:30.830
GRACE:
Hey.

37:30.880 --> 37:32.700
I'm gonna get a snack. You sure
you don't want anything?

37:32.750 --> 37:36.413
Yeah. Uh... I have to go now.

37:38.020 --> 37:40.284
Grace...

37:40.320 --> 37:42.550
would you give this
to your mom, please?

37:42.590 --> 37:45.058
Sure.

37:45.090 --> 37:46.751
Just whenever would be great.

37:46.790 --> 37:48.326
Okay.

37:56.370 --> 37:58.600
Bye.

38:01.940 --> 38:04.306
Good-bye.

38:09.680 --> 38:10.977
You're sure of this,
Ms. Lockhart?
DIANE:
I am, Your Honor.

38:11.020 --> 38:13.545
I personally inspected
the evidence this morning,

38:13.590 --> 38:14.955
and here is

38:14.990 --> 38:16.355
an affidavit from the

38:16.390 --> 38:18.620
custodian at the lab.
The charge says

38:18.660 --> 38:22.596
that Mrs. Nolfi was caught
with 26 tablets of Ecstasy.

38:22.630 --> 38:25.690
But in fact, the tablets had
been cut in half, which means

38:25.730 --> 38:28.028
that there were really
only 13 tablets in the package.

38:28.070 --> 38:29.697
And the threshold

38:29.740 --> 38:33.460
number for the mandatory minimum
to apply is...

38:33.510 --> 38:35.535
15 tablets, Your Honor.
Then it is

38:35.580 --> 38:37.878
my pleasure to inform you,
Mrs. Nolfi,

38:37.910 --> 38:41.073
that I am finding you guilty
of possession of only

38:41.110 --> 38:43.010
13 tablets of Ecstasy,

38:43.050 --> 38:45.416
and therefore, will
be sentencing you

38:45.450 --> 38:47.543
to six months probation,

38:47.590 --> 38:50.013
which will hereby be deemed...
served.

38:54.160 --> 38:56.048
Uh, I've just been speaking
with Mr. Dipple.

38:56.100 --> 38:58.489
We need to bring Alicia
on board.
Alicia came by last night

38:58.530 --> 39:00.623
and apologized.
Because we have
her by the throat.

39:00.670 --> 39:02.797
No, I apologized, too.
It was all a misunderstanding.

39:02.840 --> 39:04.398
Good.

39:04.440 --> 39:05.634
Then we should bring her back.

39:05.670 --> 39:06.864
REESE:
No, you shouldn't.

39:06.910 --> 39:09.105
Mr. Dipple,
I'm sorry, but

39:09.140 --> 39:11.745
if you could give us a minute,
we have an urgent

39:11.780 --> 39:13.099
personnel matter to resolve.
You resolve away.

39:13.150 --> 39:14.970
But for what it's worth,

39:15.020 --> 39:17.079
if Alicia Florrick returns,
I will be moving on.

39:17.120 --> 39:18.519
Had the conversation

39:18.550 --> 39:20.518
with Diane
this morning.
What?

39:20.550 --> 39:22.108
I may not see eye-to-eye
with all y'all

39:22.160 --> 39:24.151
when it comes to politics.
DAVID: _
Worry not, Sir.

39:24.190 --> 39:26.055
You and I are on
the same page.

39:26.090 --> 39:27.682
But I do value integrity.

39:27.730 --> 39:29.550
Yes, and no one has more
than Alicia.

39:29.600 --> 39:31.090
Mr. Agos, I am
scrutinized

39:31.130 --> 39:34.839
heavily-- by the press,
bloggers of every stripe.

39:34.870 --> 39:36.895
Now, I can deal with the scandal
that Diane's involved with,

39:36.940 --> 39:38.134
but I do have
my limits.

39:38.170 --> 39:39.762
Look, Alicia did nothing wrong.

39:39.810 --> 39:41.437
You and I both know
that doesn't matter.

39:41.480 --> 39:43.072
The Florrick name?

39:43.110 --> 39:45.408
It's like George Ryan
or Blagojevich.

39:45.450 --> 39:48.078
It's just another in a long line
of corrupt Chicago pols.

39:48.110 --> 39:49.771
I'm sorry,

39:49.820 --> 39:52.186
but it's just
how it is.
Excuse me. Mr. Agos?

39:52.220 --> 39:54.415
No answer from Kalinda.
She's not in today.

39:54.460 --> 39:56.758
Did you try her
at home?
Yeah, it just
kept ringing.

39:56.790 --> 39:58.678
Did you try her
on her cell?
No.

39:58.730 --> 40:00.686
(sighs)

40:00.730 --> 40:02.948
(tones sounding)

40:03.000 --> 40:06.788
FEMALE VOICE:
I'm sorry. The number you have
reached is not in service.

40:14.480 --> 40:17.802
* Broken windows
and empty hallways *

40:17.840 --> 40:20.741
(knocHng)
CARY:
KaHnda?

40:20.780 --> 40:25.012
* A pale dead moon
in a sky streaked with gray *

40:27.250 --> 40:30.913
* Human kindness

40:30.960 --> 40:35.226
* Is overflowing

40:35.260 --> 40:37.626
* And I think it's going

40:37.660 --> 40:41.198
* To rain today...

40:42.800 --> 40:45.507
Who called you?
Diane.

40:45.540 --> 40:47.098
Wow. Well, that's payback

40:47.140 --> 40:49.233
for dropping her as
Supreme Court justice.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.669
No. It isn't.

40:53.180 --> 40:55.512
Well, screw 'em.
Start your own firm.

40:55.550 --> 40:57.472
I don't have any clients.

40:57.520 --> 40:59.681
Call your old clients,
and just tell them...

40:59.720 --> 41:01.085
I did.

41:01.120 --> 41:03.816
No one wants to stay.

41:03.860 --> 41:06.226
I mean, Colin Sweeney, but...

41:06.260 --> 41:08.080
(sighs)

41:08.130 --> 41:10.257
I'm damaged goods.

41:10.300 --> 41:12.723
Listen...

41:13.900 --> 41:16.061
Give it time.

41:16.100 --> 41:19.831
Look at me. A year after jail, I
was back in the S.A.'s office.

41:19.870 --> 41:21.235
I'm tired, Peter.

41:21.270 --> 41:23.204
It's okay. Be tired.

41:23.240 --> 41:25.504
Rest, read a book.

41:25.550 --> 41:27.939
Recharge the batteries.

41:27.980 --> 41:30.210
Eli was talking about
getting a ghostwriter.

41:30.250 --> 41:32.286
I think you should
write a book.

41:32.320 --> 41:34.709
About?

41:34.760 --> 41:37.183
You. Your story, your
political philosophy.

41:37.220 --> 41:39.552
People are interested.

41:39.590 --> 41:41.694
They're more interested
in you than me.

41:41.730 --> 41:44.051
You can do it, Alicia.

41:44.100 --> 41:46.261
You can come
back from this.

41:46.300 --> 41:48.894
I know it.

41:56.580 --> 41:59.708
* Human kindness

41:59.750 --> 42:03.242
* Is overflowing

42:03.280 --> 42:05.783
* And I think it's going

42:05.820 --> 42:08.584
* To rain today

42:33.910 --> 42:36.549
(sniffles)

42:46.360 --> 42:49.329
* Bright before me

42:49.360 --> 42:54.263
* The signs implore me

42:54.300 --> 43:00.330
* To help the needy
and show them the way *

43:00.370 --> 43:01.974
(sobs)

43:02.010 --> 43:03.898
* Human kindness...

43:03.940 --> 43:05.601
Oh.

43:05.650 --> 43:07.299
* Is overflowing

43:07.350 --> 43:09.841
(crying)

43:09.880 --> 43:13.646
* I think it's going
to rain today... *
