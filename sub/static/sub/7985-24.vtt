00:02.606 --> 00:04.408
I want them all to be stars.

00:04.408 --> 00:05.812
I want to be involved
in your kids' lives.

00:05.812 --> 00:07.649

00:07.649 --> 00:09.653
<i>Nia, I went, I watched your</i>

00:09.653 --> 00:10.822

00:10.822 --> 00:13.728
HOLLY: <i>Nia does have</i>
<i>a blossoming career.</i>

00:13.728 --> 00:15.364
She wants to
join that bandwagon.

00:15.364 --> 00:16.734
Join it and be positive.

ASHLEE: <i>Brynn is doing a duet</i>

00:19.138 --> 00:20.575
ABBY LEE:
<i>Yeah, you don't want to do it.</i>

00:20.575 --> 00:22.211
It's obvious.

00:22.211 --> 00:23.380
JESSALYNN:
Why is she bullying

00:23.380 --> 00:24.883
and it's okay?
Kendall got her duo

00:24.883 --> 00:26.887
<i>taken away because</i>
<i>she did that crap.</i>

00:26.887 --> 00:28.758
Keep your big,
fat nose away from her.

00:28.758 --> 00:30.427
Bitch.

00:30.427 --> 00:32.599
ABBY LEE:

00:39.478 --> 00:40.582

00:40.582 --> 00:42.284
Now Abby wants a part of it.

00:42.284 --> 00:43.788
NIA:

00:43.788 --> 00:45.090

00:55.010 --> 00:56.580
Abby, you're the dance teacher.

01:47.214 --> 01:49.986
I think it's interesting that

01:49.986 --> 01:52.826
Abby didn't want anything
to do with Nia

01:52.826 --> 01:54.930
last season.
Yeah.

01:54.930 --> 01:57.201
And now that Nia's
moving on and doing

01:57.201 --> 01:59.539
some great things,
now Abby wants a part of it.

01:59.539 --> 02:01.309
And Abby wanted
to manage Kendall

02:01.309 --> 02:02.812
and...

02:02.812 --> 02:05.585
it's been 18 months since
Kendall's music came out.

02:05.585 --> 02:08.456
ASHLEE: I think Abby
is trying to salvage

02:08.456 --> 02:10.360
the relationship she has.

02:10.360 --> 02:13.601
JILL: Well, she is
the last standing...
Last standing.

02:13.601 --> 02:15.805
JESSALYNN: But seriously,
part of the new beginnings was

02:15.805 --> 02:17.307
she wasn't gonna
single anybody out,

02:17.307 --> 02:19.311
like she did Maddie
for so many years,

02:19.311 --> 02:21.115
and just work on one child.

02:21.115 --> 02:23.687
She has a studio full of kids.

02:23.687 --> 02:25.658
We all give up a lot
to be here in L. A.

02:25.658 --> 02:27.427
<i>I mean, my mom is sick,</i>

02:27.427 --> 02:28.731
I have a dance studio at home.

02:28.731 --> 02:30.568
<i>A family at home.</i>

02:30.568 --> 02:32.171
Nia!
Hi.

02:32.171 --> 02:33.507
Hello.

02:33.507 --> 02:35.210
JESSALYNN: <i>I certainly</i>
<i>did not give up everything</i>

02:35.210 --> 02:36.747
for Abby to ignore JoJo.

02:37.916 --> 02:39.251
<i>Let's do this.</i>

02:39.251 --> 02:41.389
Like, if‐‐ like, if we're out
here, let's make the most of it.

02:41.389 --> 02:43.259
Let's have a good week,
let's support each other.

02:43.259 --> 02:45.163
I think the morale

02:45.163 --> 02:46.499
for the girls isn't good

02:46.499 --> 02:48.403
when there's craziness.

02:48.403 --> 02:52.211
I am not responsible for
your kid crying all the time.

02:52.211 --> 02:53.514
Yeah, let's just go.

02:53.514 --> 02:55.751
Let them have their own
show with the crybabies.

02:57.522 --> 02:59.091
It's not good for anybody.

02:59.091 --> 03:00.728
KALANI:
<i>Brynn,</i>

03:00.728 --> 03:02.331
how you doing?
How you feeling?

03:03.567 --> 03:05.905
Because I know that you had
a really hard week last week.

03:06.874 --> 03:08.109
Right.
I know.

03:08.109 --> 03:10.347
And the thing is...
I never saw you cry
till last week.

03:10.347 --> 03:11.783
...you told nobody
why you were sad.

03:13.019 --> 03:15.257
That's what I don't get.

03:15.257 --> 03:17.094
Sometimes it's really hard
to talk to the girls

03:17.094 --> 03:20.467
about me being upset because
it's their moms who, kind of,

03:20.467 --> 03:21.737
<i>caused it.</i>

03:21.737 --> 03:23.507
<i>And I don't want to make</i>

03:23.507 --> 03:25.277
the other girls mad, too.

03:25.277 --> 03:26.980
<i>But sometimes I feel like</i>

03:26.980 --> 03:28.517
their moms don't want me here,

03:28.517 --> 03:31.155
so it makes everything
really complicated.

03:31.155 --> 03:33.259
KALANI:
Okay, well, whatever happens

03:33.259 --> 03:35.564
between our moms can't affect us

03:35.564 --> 03:37.167
because we're a team

03:37.167 --> 03:38.804
and we got to stick together.

03:38.804 --> 03:40.307
JESSALYNN:
<i>If I attacked</i>

03:40.307 --> 03:42.879
your kid, your kid,
or your kid, I'm sorry.

03:42.879 --> 03:45.317
I've done a lot of thinking
and I don't want to fight

03:45.317 --> 03:48.156
with the moms, I don't want
to fight with the kids.

03:48.156 --> 03:49.693
I want to get along, so

03:49.693 --> 03:51.495
let's just‐‐ let's have fun.

<i>Whether Jess' apology</i>

03:55.638 --> 03:57.207

03:57.207 --> 03:59.311
<i>at least it's a start.</i>

03:59.311 --> 04:01.550

and place, okay?

What the hell's going on?

17:25.255 --> 17:27.292
ABBY LEE:
<i>Coming up on</i> Dance Moms...

17:28.696 --> 17:30.933
HOLLY:
<i>I'm gonna go check on Jess</i>

17:30.933 --> 17:32.302
for a second.

17:34.073 --> 17:36.010
Are you okay?
Um...

17:36.010 --> 17:37.780
What's up?
Is it home

17:37.780 --> 17:38.916
or is it studio?

17:38.916 --> 17:39.985
Home.

17:39.985 --> 17:41.588
My dad,
my sister...

17:41.588 --> 17:43.424
they think I should've left,

17:43.424 --> 17:45.863
when my mom got sick,
and went home. (sniffs)

17:45.863 --> 17:47.399
Oh, my gosh.

17:49.571 --> 17:50.573
I can't.

17:50.573 --> 17:51.575
Like, I'm not.

17:51.575 --> 17:53.111
(sniffs)

17:53.111 --> 17:54.279
<i>There's a lot</i>

17:54.279 --> 17:56.050
going on in my personal life
right now.

17:56.050 --> 17:58.421
You know, my mom is sick,
her cancer is back,

17:58.421 --> 18:01.327
<i>and some people in my family</i>

18:01.327 --> 18:02.830
aren't supportive
of what I do with JoJo

18:02.830 --> 18:03.999
and how I spend my time.

18:03.999 --> 18:06.003
<i>And it comes to the point</i>

18:06.003 --> 18:07.774
where sometimes you just
can't take it anymore.

18:07.774 --> 18:10.211
It's just, like,
my whole family,

18:10.211 --> 18:13.552
like, they're just mad
that I'm here and I'm not there.

18:13.552 --> 18:15.121
And my dad just wrote
on social media

18:15.121 --> 18:17.760
that my sister's little girl
is a better dancer than JoJo

18:17.760 --> 18:19.096
and, like, all this stuff

18:19.096 --> 18:21.100
and I'm like...
That's‐that's wrong.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.102
(sniffs)

18:22.102 --> 18:23.672
It's like I've picked.

18:23.672 --> 18:24.941
JILL:
That's not what
it's about.

18:24.941 --> 18:26.812
It's about a future for JoJo

18:26.812 --> 18:28.782
and all the kids.

18:28.782 --> 18:30.853
I've always been
very close to my mom

18:30.853 --> 18:32.824
and it's hard to be away,

18:32.824 --> 18:35.095
<i>but from the time</i>

18:35.095 --> 18:37.834
JoJo has been able to walk,
I knew

18:37.834 --> 18:40.071
<i>she was gonna be a famous star.</i>

18:40.071 --> 18:42.543
<i>Like, she is brilliant,</i>
<i>and I can't</i>

18:42.543 --> 18:44.213
throw that away,
like, she loves it.

18:44.213 --> 18:46.117
<i>She's thriving, she's happy,</i>

18:46.117 --> 18:47.787
and that's how it's gonna stay.

18:47.787 --> 18:49.089
JILL:
Okay, well, no more tears.

18:49.089 --> 18:50.291
No.
'Cause I don't want Abby

18:50.291 --> 18:51.528
pulling out the pillowcases!

18:51.528 --> 18:52.897
(laughs)
Oh, right.

18:52.897 --> 18:54.233
I can't have
the freakin' pillowcase.

18:54.233 --> 18:56.003
Nope. Okay, so that's
our little secret.

18:56.003 --> 18:57.005
We're not telling.

18:57.005 --> 18:58.876
ASHLEE:
So if I cry next week,

18:58.876 --> 19:00.546
it's a secret, right?
If you have

19:00.546 --> 19:02.215
a really good reason...
JILL:
What do you mean next week?

19:02.215 --> 19:04.286
I give you
to the end of the day.

19:04.286 --> 19:07.560
You'll be crying,
you've cried every day.

19:07.560 --> 19:08.729
ABBY LEE:
"Love Anyone You Want 2."

19:08.729 --> 19:09.731
It needs to be a performance.

19:09.731 --> 19:12.703
Less effort,

19:12.703 --> 19:15.275
more technique,
more showmanship.

19:15.275 --> 19:17.012
You need to make it
all about her.

19:17.012 --> 19:18.414
So that's what
we want to do.

19:18.414 --> 19:20.285
We want to make her
look great. Let's go.

19:21.588 --> 19:23.057
Okay.

19:23.057 --> 19:24.694
Five, six, seven, eight.

19:26.363 --> 19:28.434
(laughing)

19:28.434 --> 19:29.838
NIA:
<i>JoJo, Kendall and Kalani</i>

19:29.838 --> 19:31.975
have a really good trio
this week.

19:31.975 --> 19:35.014
<i>And I'm dancing with two boys</i>

19:35.014 --> 19:36.818
that I've never
danced with before.

19:36.818 --> 19:38.555
<i>And it's challenging.</i>

19:38.555 --> 19:41.795
<i>I'm a little nervous</i>
<i>for Lesley to come in</i>

19:41.795 --> 19:43.231
before we have
this choreography down.

19:43.231 --> 19:44.701
<i>There's a lot to do.</i>

19:44.701 --> 19:46.705
JILL:
<i>I think Nia has her work</i>

19:46.705 --> 19:49.978
cut out for her, because
to bring in two boys

19:49.978 --> 19:51.848
that Nia's never danced with...

19:51.848 --> 19:53.317
You know, that's difficult.

19:57.292 --> 19:58.562
HOLLY:
Hey!

19:58.562 --> 20:00.766
Look who's here!
JESSALYNN:
Oh, hey!

20:00.766 --> 20:02.068
It's good to see you, Lesley.

20:02.068 --> 20:03.304
This is Lesley.
Hello.

20:03.304 --> 20:04.707
I don't know if you guys
have met Nia's manager.

20:04.707 --> 20:06.443
She's here.

20:06.443 --> 20:07.613
This is great.

20:07.613 --> 20:08.649
How's it going?
It's going well.

20:08.649 --> 20:10.318
They just started
a trio.
Yeah.

20:10.318 --> 20:12.890
♪ Still bears your name ♪

20:12.890 --> 20:14.192
♪ <i>Mm‐hmm</i> ♪

20:14.192 --> 20:16.030
♪ I go out... ♪

20:16.030 --> 20:17.365
HOLLY:
The dance looks mature,

20:17.365 --> 20:18.568
like it has
mature content,

20:18.568 --> 20:20.940
but also, knowing Abby,
the past experience,

20:20.940 --> 20:23.679
we need to make sure
Abby continues to give her

20:23.679 --> 20:25.448
the opportunity so she can
do this on a regular basis.

20:25.448 --> 20:26.718
JILL:
Yeah.

20:26.718 --> 20:28.822
Like with the group dance
and everything and...

20:28.822 --> 20:30.926
LESLEY: <i>You know, I need</i>
<i>to see her moved from</i>

20:30.926 --> 20:32.228
the back row.

20:32.228 --> 20:33.699
(laughter)

20:36.070 --> 20:37.038
JoJo has a home

20:37.038 --> 20:38.407
there, too.

20:38.407 --> 20:39.777
Okay, I come here.
Mm‐hmm.

20:39.777 --> 20:41.380
You swing me around
and let go.

20:41.380 --> 20:42.382
Okay.

20:42.382 --> 20:44.353
Does Abby still
manage Kendall?

20:44.353 --> 20:45.355
JILL:
Um...

20:45.355 --> 20:47.927
Abby manages Kendall's music...

20:47.927 --> 20:50.264
but she's not doing anything
with it right now.

20:50.264 --> 20:52.369
Kendall spent
the entire summer

20:52.369 --> 20:54.741
working on an album,

20:54.741 --> 20:57.345
and now Abby is preoccupied

20:57.345 --> 20:58.882
and doesn't really
have the time

20:58.882 --> 20:59.884
to focus on it.

20:59.884 --> 21:02.055
Abby's worried about Abby.

21:02.055 --> 21:03.290
<i>Why am I frustrated with Abby?</i>

21:03.290 --> 21:04.894
<i>Where do I start?</i>

21:04.894 --> 21:07.867
Kendall has 13 songs, right now,

21:07.867 --> 21:09.604
<i>that Abby is sitting on.</i>

21:09.604 --> 21:10.606
<i>And now,</i>

21:10.606 --> 21:12.475
<i>Abby, all of a sudden,</i>

21:12.475 --> 21:13.678
<i>wants to be involved</i>

21:13.678 --> 21:15.048
<i>in Nia's stuff.</i>

21:15.048 --> 21:18.522
<i>She spent two years</i>
<i>pushing Nia away.</i>

21:18.522 --> 21:19.924
<i>Makes no sense.</i>

21:19.924 --> 21:20.926
JILL:
Oh, hello.

21:23.064 --> 21:24.834
HOLLY:
Abby, guess who's here.
This is Lesley.

21:24.834 --> 21:27.038
You've met Lesley before.
Abby.
Hi. We've met. Welcome.

21:27.038 --> 21:29.409
(laughing):
Thank you.
Why don't you
two come on in?

21:29.409 --> 21:30.913
Okay, sounds great.
We're working on
her trio right now.

21:33.417 --> 21:34.687
Thank you.

21:37.526 --> 21:39.396
JILL:
Oh, my God, never.

21:39.396 --> 21:40.599
Never.

21:40.599 --> 21:42.435
JESSALYNN:
<i>I think Lesley</i>

21:42.435 --> 21:43.705
wants to make Nia a star.

21:43.705 --> 21:45.174
Not so sure about Abby.

21:45.174 --> 21:48.314
But if Abby's jumping
on Lesley's train,

21:48.314 --> 21:50.384
there's definitely
something in it for Abby.

21:50.384 --> 21:52.222
I'm thinking it's green

21:52.222 --> 21:54.292
and it rhymes with "honey"

21:54.292 --> 21:56.296
and Abby loves it

21:56.296 --> 21:57.700
more than anything.

21:57.700 --> 22:00.204
LESLEY:
What I wanted to say

22:00.204 --> 22:03.979
is to thank you for...

22:03.979 --> 22:05.481
like, all of this.
Oh, well, thank you.

22:05.481 --> 22:06.784
That's, you don't
need to thank me.
Where she is...

22:06.784 --> 22:08.053
ABBY LEE:
It's my job.

22:09.757 --> 22:11.961
Nia, watch...
look at your legs in the mirror.

22:11.961 --> 22:12.997
Make sure they look beautiful.

22:15.802 --> 22:17.840
That's in first, Nia,
your feet.

22:25.756 --> 22:27.793
LESLEY:
I'm not looking for her

22:27.793 --> 22:29.797
to be the next Maddie.

22:29.797 --> 22:30.832
She's Nia.

22:30.832 --> 22:32.503
She's unique.
And I...
Well, no.

22:32.503 --> 22:35.776
I need you
to celebrate it with us.

22:35.776 --> 22:38.113
This is a girl

22:38.113 --> 22:41.821
that can sing and she can act

22:41.821 --> 22:42.923
and she can dance.

22:42.923 --> 22:44.192
So however she makes it,

22:44.192 --> 22:45.862
she is going to make it.

22:45.862 --> 22:47.165
And you have been
a part of that.

22:47.165 --> 22:48.500
I kind of think
she's already made it.

22:48.500 --> 22:49.670
Right,

22:49.670 --> 22:51.741
but I don't see you
celebrating that.

22:51.741 --> 22:54.045
ABBY LEE:
Well, I'm very proud of her.

22:54.045 --> 22:55.047
Don't ever think
that I'm not.

22:55.047 --> 22:57.352
But... but...
what I see,

22:57.352 --> 23:00.091
constantly, is a kid
in the back row.

23:00.091 --> 23:01.561
ABBY LEE:
<i>I don't think Lesley</i>

23:01.561 --> 23:04.967
understands that
I do want Nia to succeed.

23:04.967 --> 23:07.205
<i>I want her to be a star.</i>

23:07.205 --> 23:08.407
<i>I mean, just as big as Maddie.</i>

23:08.407 --> 23:09.409
<i>But Nia</i>

23:09.409 --> 23:11.547
doesn't execute

23:11.547 --> 23:14.185
<i>the choreography the way</i>
<i>we hoped it would turn out.</i>

23:14.185 --> 23:15.589
<i>It's going to take</i>
<i>a lot of tough love</i>

23:15.589 --> 23:19.029
to get Nia to the level
of a Maddie.

23:19.029 --> 23:20.899
Nia, every time you hinge,

23:20.899 --> 23:23.037
you don't use your feet.

23:23.037 --> 23:25.408
You're not up in your feet
all the time.

23:25.408 --> 23:26.944
This is...

23:26.944 --> 23:28.648
ten years. It has nothing
to do with this dance.

23:28.648 --> 23:30.719
HOLLY:
Okay. I'm gonna leave,
'cause there's a lot...

23:30.719 --> 23:32.556
It looks great.
Not that you need

23:32.556 --> 23:33.925
my validation, but...

23:33.925 --> 23:35.629
<i>This is why I'm concerned</i>

23:35.629 --> 23:38.267
<i>about Abby's interest in Nia.</i>

23:38.267 --> 23:41.841
<i>How dare Abby Lee Miller</i>

23:41.841 --> 23:43.210
<i>trash Nia's technique</i>

23:43.210 --> 23:46.283
<i>by trying</i>
<i>to publically shame her?</i>

23:46.283 --> 23:47.385
Who's her teacher?

23:47.385 --> 23:49.222
Who's responsible
for the technique?

23:49.222 --> 23:50.257
Abby.

23:50.257 --> 23:52.095
<i>Abby's holding Nia back.</i>

23:52.095 --> 23:53.832
<i>Nia's not holding Nia back.</i>

23:55.334 --> 23:56.738
ABBY LEE:
<i>I can use a bunch of words</i>

23:56.738 --> 23:59.342
that are probably unkind
and hurtful,

23:59.342 --> 24:00.344
but very truthful.

24:00.344 --> 24:02.816
We talk about it
all the time.

24:02.816 --> 24:04.285
We give her very mature
choreography,

24:04.285 --> 24:06.456
and this is where
Holly has the blinders on.

24:06.456 --> 24:08.762
By the time she
puts it onstage,

24:08.762 --> 24:13.003
she has taken it
and watered it down

24:13.003 --> 24:15.374
to be step, touch, step, touch,

24:15.374 --> 24:17.145
stag jump.

24:17.145 --> 24:18.147
LESLEY:
How can I help?

24:18.147 --> 24:19.917
Buy a hammer,
hit her in the kneecaps‐‐

24:19.917 --> 24:21.353
(laughing):
that's one. Number two...
Because...

24:21.353 --> 24:23.591
I mean, this is a big thing
we're working on,

24:23.591 --> 24:25.327
also, in the acting.
I just want us to keep

24:25.327 --> 24:26.396
working together.

24:26.396 --> 24:27.398
ABBY LEE:
You got it, babe.

24:27.398 --> 24:28.701
Okay?
Thank you.

24:28.701 --> 24:30.037
Thanks for coming, then.
All right.

24:30.037 --> 24:32.576
Thank you.
And I hope this piece
is a big winner.

24:39.890 --> 24:42.395
ABBY LEE:
<i>Coming up on</i> Dance Moms...

24:43.932 --> 24:45.468
JILL:
<i>Do you like the trio?</i>

24:45.468 --> 24:46.904
Hmm? Yeah, it's good.

24:46.904 --> 24:48.641
<i>I think Abby's into it.</i>

24:48.641 --> 24:50.645
She's not... in a different
world, so that's...

24:50.645 --> 24:51.647
JILL:
<i>Oh, that's good.</i>

24:51.647 --> 24:53.250
<i>I mean, it's time for everybody</i>

24:53.250 --> 24:54.687
to move up and move on.
Mm‐hmm.

24:54.687 --> 24:56.591
You've got
your album.

24:56.591 --> 24:58.761
But I'm just afraid
Abby's too busy

24:58.761 --> 25:01.299
right now to follow
through with it.
I know. So we should

25:01.299 --> 25:02.435
get out of it.

25:02.435 --> 25:03.705
Timing is
everything.

25:03.705 --> 25:05.241
We're gonna wait
for the right time

25:05.241 --> 25:07.311
to move on and see
what our next step is.

25:07.311 --> 25:09.182
That's all.

25:09.182 --> 25:11.253
We eventually have
to hash this out

25:11.253 --> 25:12.556
and figure out what Abby's plans

25:12.556 --> 25:14.527
<i>are for Kendall's future</i>

Something I like

26:01.019 --> 26:02.021
about doing Madonna

is she was
notorious

26:03.390 --> 26:05.327

26:23.898 --> 26:25.367
<i>with "Wax Madonnas,"</i>

26:25.367 --> 26:27.739

the people that kick
you when you're down.

42:50.803 --> 42:52.741
ASHLEE:
<i>I really</i>

42:52.741 --> 42:54.477
<i>enjoyed the dance.</i>
<i>I thought it was entertaining.</i>

42:54.477 --> 42:56.114
I thought they pulled it off.

42:56.114 --> 42:58.786
<i>They did the best</i>
<i>with what they were given.</i>

43:00.957 --> 43:02.694
ANNOUNCER:
All right, here we go.

43:02.694 --> 43:06.334
In our advanced teen
duet/trio...

43:06.334 --> 43:09.608
JILL:
<i>I think both duets</i>
<i>were amazing.</i>

43:09.608 --> 43:11.210
<i>Nia and the boys were great.</i>

43:11.210 --> 43:12.379
Kendall's trio,

43:12.379 --> 43:14.283
<i>I loved, but we're in Fresno.</i>

43:14.283 --> 43:16.487
<i>We've been here before.</i>

43:16.487 --> 43:18.224
We never really come out on top,

43:18.224 --> 43:19.695
<i>and if they don't win,</i>

43:19.695 --> 43:20.997
<i>Abby is going</i>

43:20.997 --> 43:22.701
to tear our kids to shreds.

43:22.701 --> 43:24.270
ANNOUNCER:
In third place...

43:25.707 --> 43:27.042
...entry number four,

43:30.850 --> 43:33.154
In second place, we have...

43:37.931 --> 43:40.402
...entry number 30,
"Abby's Angels."

43:48.118 --> 43:49.588
How awful would it be

43:49.588 --> 43:51.558
<i>if Nia doesn't place?</i>

43:51.558 --> 43:53.361
<i>This week I brought Lesley in.</i>

43:53.361 --> 43:54.998
I've talked about MSA

43:54.998 --> 43:58.371
<i>signing her,</i>
<i>and she doesn't place at all.</i>

43:58.371 --> 43:59.875
Abby's gonna be like,
"Ah‐nah‐nah‐nah‐nah."

43:59.875 --> 44:02.112
She's gonna be
thumbing her nose at me.

44:02.112 --> 44:03.749
ANNOUNCER:
And in first place...

44:06.287 --> 44:11.063
...entry number 29,
"Love Anyone You Want 2."

44:12.600 --> 44:14.938
They pulled it off!

44:14.938 --> 44:17.442
I cannot believe
they pulled that off.

44:17.442 --> 44:18.579
Yes!

44:18.579 --> 44:19.815
<i>Nia's trio wins.</i>

44:19.815 --> 44:21.250
<i>I am...</i>

44:21.250 --> 44:22.152
speechless.

44:22.152 --> 44:23.756
<i>Gianna was happy.</i>

44:23.756 --> 44:25.058
<i>I was happy.</i>

44:25.058 --> 44:26.260
<i>Nia's manager is gonna</i>

44:26.260 --> 44:27.697
<i>be excited about it, and...</i>

44:29.166 --> 44:31.839
...Abby's eating popcorn.

44:31.839 --> 44:33.441
This is so good.

44:35.011 --> 44:36.214
It's better than movie theater.

44:36.214 --> 44:37.482
It's so good.

44:37.482 --> 44:39.486
ANNOUNCER:
All right.

44:42.226 --> 44:43.929
all the moms coming
together as one today

44:43.929 --> 44:47.069
<i>isn't the only positive thing</i>
<i>we're gonna see.</i>

44:47.069 --> 44:48.404
<i>This week has been a mess,</i>

44:48.404 --> 44:50.308
<i>and I'm not sure how the girls</i>
<i>are gonna overcome it.</i>

44:50.308 --> 44:51.678

JESSALYNN:
<i>This dance could have been</i>

45:15.358 --> 45:17.029
amazing,

45:17.029 --> 45:20.068
<i>but it wasn't.</i>

45:20.068 --> 45:22.607
<i>The only person to blame</i>
<i>is Abby.</i>

45:22.607 --> 45:23.976
Our kids need training.

45:23.976 --> 45:25.278
They need classes

45:25.278 --> 45:27.850
<i>or our kids are</i>
<i>gonna suffer for it.</i>

45:29.955 --> 45:32.694
(whooping and cheering)

45:32.694 --> 45:34.998
HOLLY:
Good job, you guys!

45:34.998 --> 45:36.400
Congratulations!

45:36.400 --> 45:38.071
What a big win, though!

45:38.071 --> 45:39.173
Doesn't it feel

45:39.173 --> 45:40.008
so good?

45:40.008 --> 45:42.179
How about if

45:42.179 --> 45:43.849
you guys go get ready
for the bus ride back?

45:46.555 --> 45:48.191
ASHLEE:
Now, Abby, you know
that I like you.

45:48.191 --> 45:50.596
I just want to say that
when you left the room,

45:50.596 --> 45:51.765
the negative went down

45:51.765 --> 45:53.569
and it just, like,
calmed down the girls.

45:53.569 --> 45:54.571
See?

45:54.571 --> 45:56.107
That's why I was never there.

45:56.107 --> 45:57.510
'Cause I make the kids crazy.

45:57.510 --> 45:59.446
No, 'cause last
week you didn't,

45:59.446 --> 46:01.083
so I beg to differ.

46:01.083 --> 46:02.653
You‐you‐you have
that capacity...
JESSALYNN:
Last week was awesome.

46:02.653 --> 46:03.856
...so that's a cop‐out.
You had...

46:03.856 --> 46:06.661
I think we all felt
very abandoned today.

46:06.661 --> 46:08.431
Well, you're coddling them;
they're babies.
JESSALYNN:
No, I'm not!

46:08.431 --> 46:09.901
I'm training them!
I'm teaching them,

46:09.901 --> 46:10.903
and I'm helping them.

46:10.903 --> 46:12.305
You're in the audience
eating popcorn.

46:12.305 --> 46:14.811
You're the only one who doesn't
see the value in our girls.

46:14.811 --> 46:17.583
I do see the value, but I think
they could be better.

46:17.583 --> 46:19.621
I think they
could do more.

46:19.621 --> 46:21.625
JESSALYNN:
Abby, you're
the dance teacher!

46:21.625 --> 46:23.662
Get off your phone
and schedule some classes.

46:23.662 --> 46:27.202
If you would do your job
and see what all of these kids

46:27.202 --> 46:28.438
have to offer,
we are still here.

46:28.438 --> 46:29.440
JILL: We're here.

46:29.440 --> 46:30.475
We're here,
we followed you...

46:30.475 --> 46:31.711
All these other
kids have left.

46:31.711 --> 46:33.281
...all over the place.
Where are they now?

46:33.281 --> 46:34.383
JILL:
Your stars left.

46:34.383 --> 46:35.385
We're here.

46:35.385 --> 46:36.621
You're gonna be
alone by yourself.

46:36.621 --> 46:37.623
Is that what you want?

46:37.623 --> 46:39.794
Yes.

46:39.794 --> 46:41.798
You want to be alone.

46:41.798 --> 46:43.167
You're doing

46:43.167 --> 46:44.369
a mighty fine job

46:44.369 --> 46:45.973
'cause you're alienating
every single person.

46:45.973 --> 46:47.543
You're born alone,

46:47.543 --> 46:49.046
and you die alone.

47:00.536 --> 47:01.905
ABBY LEE:
<i>Next on</i> Dance Moms...

47:01.905 --> 47:03.609
The minis are back.

47:03.609 --> 47:05.078
<i>Who's the breakout star</i>

47:05.078 --> 47:06.615
<i>of the mini team?</i>

47:06.615 --> 47:08.619
My daughter is the best one
on this team.

47:08.619 --> 47:10.355
You need to back the (bleep)
out of my face, bitch.

47:10.355 --> 47:11.858
SARI:
<i>Tiffanie needs to realize</i>

47:11.858 --> 47:13.729
<i>that Abby is going to be</i>
<i>the one who gives</i>

47:13.729 --> 47:14.797
the crown, not her.

47:14.797 --> 47:16.467
KIRA:
<i>They don't even know</i>

47:16.467 --> 47:17.502
what they're doing.

47:17.502 --> 47:18.805
KALANI:
<i>Something bad happens,</i>

47:18.805 --> 47:21.110
<i>we just got to figure it out</i>
<i>and keep going.</i>

47:21.110 --> 47:23.014
The elites should be
Abby's priority.

47:23.014 --> 47:25.018
Nope, this is
not happening.

47:25.018 --> 47:26.220
This is <i>not</i> happening.
Get out.

47:26.220 --> 47:27.289
Get out.

47:27.289 --> 47:28.625
TIFFANIE:
<i>We are Abby's mini team.</i>

47:28.625 --> 47:29.994
Everyone's replaceable.
