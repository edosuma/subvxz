WEBVTT

00:01.968 --> 00:03.637
PREVIOUSLY ON
 PRETTY LITTLE LIARS...

00:03.671 --> 00:05.306
IT'S MY TURN
TO TORTURE YOU.

00:05.339 --> 00:08.276
WHAT'S THAT?
IT'S A BOX OF ALI'S THINGS.

00:08.309 --> 00:09.743
JASON FOUND IT.
HE GAVE IT TO ME.

00:09.777 --> 00:12.480
YOU'RE AFRAID WE FOUND
SOMETHING IN THIS BOX.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.348
NO! ALI!

00:14.382 --> 00:16.250
( shatters, screams )

00:16.283 --> 00:17.318
( tires squeal )

00:17.351 --> 00:18.319
THAT'S "A's" CELLPHONE.

00:18.352 --> 00:19.753
HANNA, CALL CALEB.

00:19.787 --> 00:21.555
HE'S THE BEST WAY THAT WE
CAN GET INFORMATION ON--

00:21.589 --> 00:23.057
NO, LEAVE HIM
OUT OF THIS.

00:23.091 --> 00:25.659
N.A.T. CLUB?
JASON DeLAURENTIS, N.A.T.

00:25.693 --> 00:26.727
GARRETT REYNOLDS, N.A.T.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.329
"FOR WE SEE ALL."

00:28.362 --> 00:30.731
NOEL BROKE UP WITH ME,
AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY.

00:30.764 --> 00:32.633
MAYBE YOU WENT OUT WITH
THE WRONG PERSON TONIGHT.

00:32.665 --> 00:35.836
I SAW THE WAY YOU LOOKED
 AT HIM BEFORE THE SHOW.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.638
WHEN MY MOM GETS HERE,
CAN YOU NOT MENTION THIS TO HER?

00:37.671 --> 00:39.607
AS LONG AS YOU PROMISE
TO DO THE SAME.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.442
I KNOW THAT YOU
WANT ANSWERS,

00:41.475 --> 00:42.776
BUT IT'S JUST
STILL NOT SAFE.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.112
THEN WHY DID
YOU COME HERE?

00:44.145 --> 00:45.746
SHUTTING YOU OUT
IS KILLING ME.

00:45.779 --> 00:47.448
THE OWNER SHUT DOWN
THE PHONE.

00:47.481 --> 00:50.184
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT
ME TO WORK ON THIS?

00:50.218 --> 00:51.719
HANNA, ARE YOU
ALL RIGHT WITH THIS?

00:54.555 --> 00:56.457
Hanna: I PASSED YOUR MOM
HEADING OUT.

00:56.490 --> 01:00.328
Spencer: THEN IT'S GO TIME.
HANNA?

01:02.563 --> 01:03.631
HANNA.

01:06.334 --> 01:07.768
HOW MUCH DID CALEB GET?

01:07.801 --> 01:10.238
I DON'T KNOW.
HE SAID HE WAS UP
MOST THE NIGHT.

01:10.271 --> 01:14.175
IT'S NOT LIKE WE EXPECTED
DECRYPTING FILES FROM "A's"
PHONE WAS GONNA BE EASY.

01:14.208 --> 01:16.144
IS CALEB STILL ASKING
WHOSE PHONE IT IS?

01:16.177 --> 01:19.347
EVERY CHANCE HE GETS,
AND I'M STILL LYING TO HIM.

01:19.380 --> 01:20.514
NOW THAT WE KNOW
THAT IT WASN'T LUCAS,

01:20.548 --> 01:21.682
MY MONEY'S
ON OFFICER GARRETT

01:21.715 --> 01:22.783
IN THE GREENHOUSE
WITH THE CELLPHONE.

01:22.816 --> 01:24.518
BUT JENNA BROKE UP
WITH GARRETT.

01:24.552 --> 01:25.653
YEAH, AFTER
THE GREENHOUSE.

01:25.686 --> 01:26.820
LOOK, THE POINT IS

01:26.854 --> 01:28.422
CALEB IS STILL ASKING
ABOUT EVERYTHING

01:28.456 --> 01:31.192
AND IT'S NOT SAFE FOR HIM
TO KNOW THE ANSWERS.

01:31.225 --> 01:33.661
WE SHOULD JUST TELL
HIM TO STOP.

01:33.694 --> 01:36.264
LET'S JUST TAKE
A LOOK FIRST.

01:36.297 --> 01:38.098
COME CLOSER.
 I KNOW YOU WANT TO KISS ME.

01:41.302 --> 01:42.503
( giggling )

01:42.536 --> 01:45.439
THIS-- THIS WAS ALL
CALEB WAS ABLE TO GET?

01:49.510 --> 01:54.148
WAIT. LOOK,
THAT'S ALISON'S BEDROOM.

02:00.654 --> 02:03.424
WHAT'S IAN DOING
IN THERE?

02:05.659 --> 02:07.628
WHAT'S HE DOING
WITH THAT CAMERA?

02:07.661 --> 02:09.263
OH, MY GOD,
HE'S HIDING IT.

02:09.297 --> 02:10.830
HE WAS RECORDING
THIS SECRETLY.

02:10.864 --> 02:13.534
WAIT, RECORDING WHAT?

02:13.567 --> 02:15.636
HEY.

02:15.669 --> 02:17.271
WHAT THE HELL ARE
JENNA AND GARRETT

02:17.305 --> 02:18.472
DOING IN ALISON'S BEDROOM?

02:18.506 --> 02:20.274
N.A.T. CLUB FIELD TRIP?

02:20.308 --> 02:21.909
IAN AND GARRETT ARE
THE FOUNDING MEMBERS.

02:21.942 --> 02:24.345
THE ONLY ONE MISSING IS...
 WHERE'S JASON?

02:24.378 --> 02:25.813
HE'S PASSED OUT.

02:25.846 --> 02:27.681
A SIX-PACK AND SOME WEED'LL
 DO THAT DO YOU.

02:27.715 --> 02:29.283
SO, WHY
 THE EMERGENCY CALL?

02:29.317 --> 02:30.684
I JUST LEFT ALISON.

02:30.718 --> 02:32.786
I TRIED TO GET HER
 TO HAND OVER OUR VIDEOS,

02:32.820 --> 02:34.555
BUT SHE WASN'T
 GOING FOR IT.

02:34.588 --> 02:36.524
HEH, IS THAT THE ONLY THING
 SHE WASN'T GOING FOR?

02:36.557 --> 02:37.825
SHUT UP, JENNA.

02:37.858 --> 02:39.793
HEY, THIS
 IS YOUR FAULT, IAN.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.529
I KNEW YOU'D GO
 TOO FAR

02:41.562 --> 02:43.497
AND THOSE VIDEOS
 WOULD COME BACK TO BITE US.

02:43.531 --> 02:45.533
THAT'S WHY I BAILED
 ON THIS MESSED-UP PLOT.

02:45.566 --> 02:48.269
OH, YEAH?
 WELL, WELCOME BACK.

02:48.302 --> 02:50.471
NOW WE FIND THEM
 BEFORE THAT BITCH SHOWS UP.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.742
SO, CALEB
HAS SEEN THIS?

02:54.775 --> 02:56.810
HE COULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN IT OFF
THAT PHONE WITHOUT SEEING IT.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.212
NOW YOU KNOW WHY
I'M FREAKING OUT!

02:58.246 --> 02:59.480
YEAH, BUT THE CLOSER

02:59.513 --> 03:00.981
WE GET TO FINDING OUT
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED--

03:01.014 --> 03:04.218
THE CLOSER CALEB GETS
TO THE TOP OF "A's" HIT LIST.

03:04.252 --> 03:06.520
HE, SHE, IT HAS MESSED
WITH ALL OUR RELATIONSHIPS--

03:06.554 --> 03:08.556
TOBY, EZRA, SAMARA...

03:08.589 --> 03:09.757
LOOK.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.659
CHECK THIS OUT.
 WHAT IS IT?

03:11.692 --> 03:14.262
IT'S JUST
 AN OLD BOX.

03:14.295 --> 03:15.663
THAT'S WEIRD.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.531
THAT'S THE BOX
JASON GAVE ME.

03:17.565 --> 03:19.867
CALEB'S DONE.
I'M TELLING HIM TODAY.

03:19.900 --> 03:23.371
SO WHAT DOES
THIS MEAN?

03:23.404 --> 03:25.306
WELL, IN CASE WE HAD
ANY DOUBTS,

03:25.339 --> 03:27.441
THE N.A.T. CLUB,
JENNA INCLUDED,

03:27.475 --> 03:28.676
WAS IN ROSEWOOD.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.711
IN ALISON'S BEDROOM.

03:32.813 --> 03:34.448
THE NIGHT ALI
WAS MURDERED.

03:42.456 --> 03:45.025
* GOT A SECRET,
 CAN YOU KEEP IT *

03:45.058 --> 03:47.628
* SWEAR THIS ONE
 YOU'LL SAVE *

03:47.661 --> 03:49.563
* BETTER LOCK IT
 IN YOUR POCKET *

03:49.597 --> 03:51.932
* TAKIN' THIS ONE
 TO THE GRAVE *

03:51.965 --> 03:54.468
* IF I SHOW YOU
 THEN I KNOW YOU *

03:54.502 --> 03:57.805
* WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID

03:57.838 --> 04:01.642
* 'CAUSE TWO CAN KEEP A SECRET
 IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD *

04:06.514 --> 04:08.482
WHEN DID YOU GET THIS?

04:08.516 --> 04:10.250
WHILE YOU WERE
DOWNSTAIRS.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.954
SO, ARIA AND HANNA
HAVEN'T SEEN THIS.

04:13.987 --> 04:15.889
( truck approaching )

04:23.431 --> 04:25.533
I THOUGHT YOU WERE TRYING
TO KEEP YOUR DISTANCE.

04:25.566 --> 04:27.501
I WAS, OKAY? I AM.
IT'S JUST THAT

04:27.535 --> 04:29.570
I SLIPPED UP LAST WEEK
AND I KISSED HIM,

04:29.603 --> 04:31.439
AND NOW TOBY THINKS THAT
WE'RE BACK TOGETHER,

04:31.472 --> 04:32.773
AND I CAN'T EVEN--

04:35.042 --> 04:36.577
TALK TO HIM.

04:36.610 --> 04:37.945
WHAT DO YOU WANT
ME TO SAY?

04:37.978 --> 04:39.680
I-I DON'T KNOW.
THAT I'M NOT HERE.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.315
NO, THAT I'M
IN THE SHOWER.

04:41.349 --> 04:43.050
DON'T MAKE ME LIE
TO HIM, SPENCER.

04:43.083 --> 04:46.587
PLEASE!
( sighs )

04:52.025 --> 04:54.962
HEY.
 HEY.

04:54.995 --> 04:57.631
IS SPENCER AROUND?

04:57.665 --> 05:02.069
UM, SHE'S UNABLE TO COME
TO THE PHONE RIGHT NOW.

05:02.102 --> 05:04.872
I CAME BY TO PICK UP
 THE REST OF MY TOOLS.

05:04.905 --> 05:08.308
SPENCER'S DAD...
 YEAH, I HEARD.

05:09.677 --> 05:10.944
HOW'S SPENCER?

05:10.978 --> 05:12.980
OKAY.

05:13.013 --> 05:14.748
SHE MISSES YOU.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.984
I MISS HER.

05:17.017 --> 05:19.987
SHE'S BEEN KIND OF
CONFUSING LATELY.

05:20.020 --> 05:21.889
THE OTHER DAY
 IN MY TRUCK, SHE SAID

05:21.922 --> 05:23.791
SHE WAS CLOSE
 TO TELLING ME SOMETHING,

05:23.824 --> 05:25.859
TO EXPLAINING
WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING.

05:25.893 --> 05:27.695
THINGS HAVE CHANGED SINCE THEN.

05:29.129 --> 05:31.699
CAN YOU TELL ME ANYTHING?
 NO.

05:31.732 --> 05:33.867
I DON'T WANT TO GET
BETWEEN YOU AND SPENCER.

05:33.901 --> 05:36.604
I DON'T THINK
THIS IS ABOUT ME AND HER.

05:36.637 --> 05:37.905
I THINK
 IT'S SOMETHING ELSE.

05:37.938 --> 05:41.409
EMILY! JUST--
( stuttering ) GET OFF!

05:41.442 --> 05:43.944
SPENCER'S DAD IS HERE.

05:43.977 --> 05:45.779
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
 COME BACK LATER.

05:45.813 --> 05:48.549
WHEN HE'S NOT HERE,
OR WHEN SPENCER'S NOT HERE?

05:57.090 --> 05:59.460
Aria: AND HE
 JUST DROVE AWAY?

05:59.493 --> 06:00.994
WHAT ELSE WAS HE
SUPPOSED TO DO?

06:01.028 --> 06:02.496
TOTALLY SHUT HIM DOWN.

06:02.530 --> 06:04.565
YOU'RE PROTECTING
SOMEBODY THAT YOU LOVE.

06:04.598 --> 06:07.401
IT'S KIND OF ROMANTIC.

06:07.435 --> 06:09.703
NO, IT'S THE OPPOSITE
OF ROMANTIC.

06:09.737 --> 06:10.804
IT'S SAFE.

06:10.838 --> 06:12.473
IT'S WHAT WE ALL
NEED TO BE.

06:12.506 --> 06:15.142
HEY, WELL, AT LEAST TOBY
STILL WANTS TO TALK TO YOU.

06:15.175 --> 06:17.144
BECAUSE THAT WAS
DEFINITELY NOT THE CASE

06:17.177 --> 06:19.079
LAST TIME I SAW EZRA.

06:19.112 --> 06:20.548
WHICH MAKES ME WONDER:

06:20.581 --> 06:22.716
WAS THAT THE LAST TIME
I'LL EVER SEE HIM?

06:22.750 --> 06:24.485
NO, ARIA.
YEAH, BUT HOW
DO I KNOW THAT?

06:24.518 --> 06:26.186
HE WON'T SEE ME.
HE WON'T TALK TO ME.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.955
MAYBE YOU JUST NEED
TO GIVE HIM SOME TIME.

06:27.988 --> 06:29.457
I GAVE HIM TIME.

06:29.490 --> 06:31.759
AT THE PLAY, HIM SNEAKING
OUT OF THE THEATER?

06:31.792 --> 06:33.427
THAT WAS TIME.

06:33.461 --> 06:35.763
NOW I JUST REALLY
WANT SOME ANSWERS.

06:35.796 --> 06:38.466
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO
WITHOUT YOUR PARENTS KNOWING?

06:38.499 --> 06:39.600
WITHOUT "A" KNOWING?

06:43.236 --> 06:45.706
HUH, THE BEARD.

06:45.739 --> 06:46.907
THE WHAT?

06:46.940 --> 06:48.609
HOLDEN,
ARIA'S BEARD.

06:48.642 --> 06:50.110
IT MEANS HE'LL
GO OUT WITH HER

06:50.143 --> 06:51.712
BUT NOT REALLY
OUT WITH HER

06:51.745 --> 06:53.080
BECAUSE HE'S NOT
REALLY INTERESTED.

06:53.113 --> 06:55.449
I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.
HE'S GAY.

06:55.483 --> 06:57.918
HE'S NOT GAY.
I'VE KNOWN HIM
SINCE I WAS FIVE.

06:57.951 --> 07:00.087
HE MIGHT NOT HAVE KNOWN
WHEN HE WAS FIVE.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.189
HAS HE EVER TRIED
TO KISS YOU?

07:02.222 --> 07:04.492
NO.

07:04.525 --> 07:06.494
GAY.
GAY.
GAY.

07:07.728 --> 07:08.896
OH...

07:13.000 --> 07:14.702
HI.
HI.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.707
SO, HOW'S THE WHOLE
REINTEGRATION

07:19.740 --> 07:21.642
INTO AMERICAN SOCIETY
THING GOING?

07:21.675 --> 07:24.177
OKAY. YOU HELPED, ACTUALLY.

07:24.211 --> 07:25.779
I DID? HOW?

07:25.813 --> 07:28.849
AH, IT'S PROBABLY
BETTER YOU DON'T KNOW.

07:28.882 --> 07:30.618
OKAY.

07:30.651 --> 07:33.086
BUT I OWE YOU ONE.
HOW'S THAT?

07:33.120 --> 07:35.756
WELL, WE'RE STILL ON
FOR TOMORROW NIGHT, RIGHT?

07:35.789 --> 07:37.825
I WAS COUNTING ON IT.

07:37.858 --> 07:40.628
GOOD. YEAH,
'CAUSE THAT'LL HELP ME.

07:40.661 --> 07:43.063
WITH YOUR FRIEND
WHO WALKS OUT ON PLAYS?

07:43.096 --> 07:46.600
MM, I THINK IT'S BEST
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW.

07:46.634 --> 07:49.670
( chuckles )
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

07:49.703 --> 07:52.039
I'LL ANSWER.
BYE.

07:56.844 --> 07:58.111
HOLDEN--

08:20.934 --> 08:23.203
( no audio )

08:41.789 --> 08:44.725
( chatter )

08:46.293 --> 08:47.861
HEY.

08:53.333 --> 08:55.302
FORGOT YOUR KEYS.

09:00.340 --> 09:02.242
OH, MAN, I TOTALLY
KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE.

09:02.275 --> 09:03.944
YOU GET SO WRAPPED UP
IN SOMETHING,

09:03.977 --> 09:05.345
YOU FORGET
WHERE YOU ARE.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.014
TWO HOURS LATER,
IT'S LIKE,

09:07.047 --> 09:09.016
"WHERE DID
I PARK MY CAR?

09:09.049 --> 09:11.952
DID I EVEN
DRIVE HERE?"

09:13.721 --> 09:15.188
THANKS.

09:24.732 --> 09:27.367
ON THE VIDEO, GARRETT LOOKED IN
THE BOX AND SAW SOMETHING WEIRD.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.737
WOULDN'T YOU LIKE
TO KNOW WHAT IT WAS?

09:29.770 --> 09:32.773
NO. LOOK, WE'VE ALREADY
SEEN WHAT WE NEEDED TO SEE...

09:32.806 --> 09:35.208
ALL OF OUR SUSPECTS
IN THE SAME PLACE

09:35.242 --> 09:37.611
AT THE SAME TIME
IN ALISON'S ROOM

09:37.645 --> 09:40.914
TALKING ABOUT
HOW MUCH THEY HATED HER.

09:40.948 --> 09:43.684
I DON'T KNOW WHY WE JUST DON'T
HAND THE DRIVE TO THE POLICE.

09:43.717 --> 09:45.619
WE SHOULD BE CLOSING THINGS,
NOT OPENING...

09:48.288 --> 09:49.356
YOU GUYS, THERE'S
SOMETHING IN HERE.

09:49.389 --> 09:50.658
WHAT IS THAT?

09:55.395 --> 09:58.065
"MY TURN TO TORTURE YOU."

09:58.098 --> 09:59.633
OKAY, THAT'S CREEPY.

09:59.667 --> 10:01.234
"YOU THINK YOU'RE SAFE
ON THE OUTSIDE,

10:01.268 --> 10:03.236
BUT YOU'RE NOT WHEN I'M
ON THE INSIDE."

10:03.270 --> 10:05.973
"SCARED YET?
YOU SHOULD BE, BITCH."

10:06.006 --> 10:08.375
THESE NOTES ARE STARTING
TO SOUND FAMILIAR.

10:08.408 --> 10:12.780
"NEXT TIME,
IT'LL BE YOUR FACE,
NOT THIS PUMPKIN."

10:12.813 --> 10:14.848
LOOKS LIKE IT WAS
CUT BY SOMETHING.

10:14.882 --> 10:17.951
IT WAS.
DON'T YOU GUYS REMEMBER?

10:17.985 --> 10:21.121
HALLOWEEN.

10:22.455 --> 10:25.092
I'VE NEVER BEEN
THIS WAY BEFORE.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.794
BACK ALLEYS
AND BACKYARDS HAVE

10:26.827 --> 10:29.062
ALWAYS BEEN THE BEST
WAY TO MY HOUSE.

10:29.096 --> 10:31.031
YOUR SISTER AND IAN
ARE SO CUTE TOGETHER.

10:31.064 --> 10:32.933
DO YOU THINK
THEY'LL GET MARRIED?

10:32.966 --> 10:36.970
I GUESS SO.
THEY SEEM PERFECT
FOR EACH OTHER.

10:37.004 --> 10:40.073
YEAH, PERFECTLY BORED.

10:40.107 --> 10:43.410
Hanna: ALI, SOMEONE
TRASHED YOUR PORCH.

10:44.945 --> 10:47.214
WHAT THE HELL?

10:59.727 --> 11:01.261
Aria: WHAT DOES
THE NOTE SAY?

11:01.294 --> 11:03.764
WHO DID THIS?

11:03.797 --> 11:07.768
JASON'S BEER BUDDIES.
REAL FUNNY.

11:10.203 --> 11:11.471
I BETTER GET GOING.

11:11.504 --> 11:14.107
YEAH, ME TOO.

11:14.141 --> 11:17.077
WHAT'S THE HURRY?
LET'S MAKE A NIGHT OF IT.

11:17.110 --> 11:19.747
IT'S ALREADY BEEN
KIND OF A LONG NIGHT.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.715
LOOK, I'M SORRY
ABOUT THE PRANK.

11:21.749 --> 11:23.250
I KNOW I TOOK
IT TOO FAR.

11:26.353 --> 11:29.923
LET ME MAKE IT UP
TO YOU GUYS.

11:29.957 --> 11:32.726
"NEXT TIME,
IT'LL BE YOUR FACE,
NOT THIS PUMPKIN."

11:32.760 --> 11:34.261
THAT WAS THE NOTE
THAT ALI GOT.

11:34.294 --> 11:37.197
THIS IS AN INVITATION

11:37.230 --> 11:38.866
FROM NOEL KAHN'S
HALLOWEEN PARTY,

11:38.899 --> 11:40.333
AS IF MY MEMORIES
OF THAT NIGHT

11:40.367 --> 11:42.936
COULD GET ANY SCARIER.

11:44.537 --> 11:47.074
GUYS, THIS NOTE
IS SIGNED BY "A."

11:47.107 --> 11:49.977
"A" WAS AFTER
ALISON, TOO,

11:50.010 --> 11:51.945
BEFORE THEY
WERE AFTER US.

12:01.822 --> 12:03.891
( period bell rings )

12:10.998 --> 12:13.133
HAVE YOU TALKED
TO HER YET?

12:13.166 --> 12:14.835
NOT YET.

12:17.337 --> 12:19.406
HEY. HEARD ABOUT
YOU AND NOEL.

12:19.439 --> 12:22.442
PEOPLE IN CHINA HAVE
HEARD ABOUT ME AND NOEL.

12:22.475 --> 12:25.212
DON'T LET IT GET
TO YOU, ALL RIGHT?
THE GUY'S A TOTAL TOOL.

12:27.948 --> 12:30.117
I THOUGHT
WE WERE FRIENDS.

12:30.150 --> 12:31.384
YOU AND NOEL?

12:31.418 --> 12:33.386
HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT A FRIEND IS.

12:33.420 --> 12:34.788
NO. YOU AND ME.

12:34.822 --> 12:36.990
I'VE BEEN CALLING
YOU FOR TWO DAYS.

12:37.024 --> 12:37.958
MONA...

12:43.163 --> 12:45.866
YOU CAN HAVE THIS BACK.
I'M DONE WITH IT.

12:45.899 --> 12:47.567
SORRY, NO RETURNS,
NO EXCHANGES.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.904
TAKE IT! MAYBE THE NEXT GIRL
YOU DECIDE TO DUMP ALL OVER

12:50.938 --> 12:52.806
WILL LIKE IT BETTER
THAN I DID.

13:10.924 --> 13:12.292
I'M SO SORRY, MONA.

13:12.325 --> 13:14.027
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.

13:14.061 --> 13:18.031
NO! YOU ARE THE WORST PERSON
FOR YOU TO BE AROUND RIGHT NOW.

13:18.065 --> 13:20.367
THAT DIDN'T COME OUT RIGHT.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.502
NOEL'S NOT WORTH IT.

13:22.535 --> 13:25.238
OKAY, IT'S NOT LIKE
ANYONE WITH HALF A BRAIN

13:25.272 --> 13:27.040
EVER TRUSTED
HIM ANYWAYS.
HANNA!

13:27.074 --> 13:29.142
I'M JUST SAYING
HE'S A BAD GUY,

13:29.176 --> 13:31.378
AND YOU DESERVE
WAY BETTER.

13:35.148 --> 13:38.385
I NEVER KNEW ANYONE
WHO COULD LIE LIKE THAT.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.820
IT WAS SECOND NATURE
WITH HIM.

13:42.622 --> 13:44.324
IT'S THOSE EYES.

13:44.357 --> 13:45.859
YOU LOOK INTO THEM,

13:45.893 --> 13:48.395
AND YOU'RE JUST,
LIKE, HYPNOTIZED.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.330
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
IS HE COULD BE

13:50.363 --> 13:52.065
A REALLY GOOD
SUPER VILLAIN.

13:52.099 --> 13:53.200
( chuckles )

13:53.233 --> 13:54.467
LOOK, I KNOW
WHAT YOU NEED.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.870
ME, YOU,
RIVE GAUCHE TONIGHT.

13:56.904 --> 13:59.039
WE'LL SHUT
THE PLACE DOWN.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.210
IT'S A DATE.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.184
EZRA. HEY.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.219
I'M CALLING
FROM EMILY'S PHONE,

14:46.253 --> 14:48.321
FOR OBVIOUS REASONS.

14:49.722 --> 14:53.093
LISTEN, I REALLY
DON'T WANT TO THINK

14:53.126 --> 14:55.562
ABOUT US BEING OVER, BUT...

14:55.595 --> 14:57.998
YOU KNOW, WHETHER
WE ARE OR WE AREN'T,

14:58.031 --> 15:01.068
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE
SHOULD DISCUSS FACE TO FACE.

15:02.302 --> 15:05.973
SO, MEET ME
TONIGHT AT 8:00

15:06.006 --> 15:10.043
IN FRONT OF THE CLOCK
BY RITTENHOUSE SQUARE.

15:10.077 --> 15:13.580
IF YOU COME, IT MEANS THAT
THERE'S STILL A CHANCE FOR US,

15:13.613 --> 15:16.149
AND IF NOT...
( beep )

15:24.257 --> 15:25.925
( vibrating )

16:18.311 --> 16:20.647
( screams )

16:20.680 --> 16:23.583
( ringing )

16:23.616 --> 16:25.352
NO!

16:28.388 --> 16:30.390
( monitor beeping,
P.A. droning )

16:30.423 --> 16:32.525
WHEN I GOT THE CALL,
NO ONE WAS SURE

16:32.559 --> 16:34.127
HOW BADLY YOU'D
BEEN HURT, AND--

16:34.161 --> 16:36.763
I WAS LUCKY.
YOUR MOM CAME HOME.

16:36.796 --> 16:38.565
I'M SO SORRY
ABOUT YESTERDAY.

16:38.598 --> 16:41.368
SPENCER...
NO, IF YOU'D JUST GOTTEN
YOUR STUFF, THEN...

16:41.401 --> 16:43.536
SPENCER, IT WOULDN'T
HAVE MADE ANY DIFFERENCE.

16:43.570 --> 16:46.673
WHAT HAPPENED?

16:46.706 --> 16:50.477
I WAS TAKING DOWN
THE SCAFFOLDING,

16:50.510 --> 16:54.514
AND THE ANCHORS
GAVE WAY, AND, UH...

16:54.547 --> 16:57.317
YOU MUST BE
THE CARPENTER.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.619
I'M DR. KINGSTON.
HELLO, SPENCER.

16:59.652 --> 17:00.820
HEY.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.722
YOU TWO KNOW
EACH OTHER?

17:02.755 --> 17:05.692
YEAH, REN USED
TO DATE MELISSA.

17:05.724 --> 17:07.794
WAS ENGAGED
TO HER, ACTUALLY,

17:07.827 --> 17:09.496
BEFORE SOMETHING
GOT IN THE WAY.

17:12.632 --> 17:14.666
SO, UH, THE X-RAYS
CONFIRM THE BREAK,

17:14.701 --> 17:16.236
BUT IT'S CLEAN,
SHOULD HEAL WELL.

17:16.269 --> 17:17.604
WE'LL PUT A CAST
ON IT SHORTLY.

17:17.637 --> 17:19.339
YOU'LL NEED
TO SPEND THE NIGHT.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.508
WHY?
IT'S ROUTINE WHEN
THERE'S BEEN A CONCUSSION,

17:21.540 --> 17:23.576
SO DON'T WORRY.
( chirping )

17:23.609 --> 17:26.146
OH, NEXT EMERGENCY.
I'LL BE BACK LATER.

17:26.179 --> 17:28.448
TRY AND BE
MORE CAREFUL
NEXT TIME, HUH?

17:28.481 --> 17:30.217
SPENCER.

17:34.154 --> 17:37.190
THERE SOMETHING
YOU WANT TO TELL ME?

17:37.224 --> 17:39.126
( beep )

17:50.270 --> 17:52.772
YEAH. OKAY, BYE.

17:52.805 --> 17:54.474
TOBY'S OKAY.

17:54.507 --> 17:55.808
YEAH, FOR NOW.

17:55.842 --> 17:58.578
GUYS, IF JENNA REALLY
IS A PART OF THIS,

17:58.611 --> 18:01.214
DO YOU THINK SHE'D ACTUALLY
HURT HER OWN STEPBROTHER?

18:01.248 --> 18:03.516
JENNA WOULD KILL
AND EAT HER OWN MOTHER
TO GET BACK AT US.

18:05.618 --> 18:08.288
MAYBE SHE'S JUST
TRYING TO SCARE HIM.

18:08.321 --> 18:10.690
OR US.
YEAH, WELL, IT'S WORKING.

18:10.723 --> 18:14.661
BUT IF JENNA AND GARRETT
BROKE UP, HOW COULD SHE
DO THIS TO TOBY?

18:14.694 --> 18:17.664
SHE MUST'VE FOUND
A REPLACEMENT.

18:27.407 --> 18:29.242
JENNA?

18:29.276 --> 18:31.144
WHY'D YOU GO BACK
TO THAT HOUSE?

18:31.178 --> 18:34.381
I--
YOU WERE NEVER SUPPOSED
TO GO BACK, TOBY.

18:34.414 --> 18:37.317
IT IS NOT SAFE
WITH THOSE GIRLS, WITH SPENCER--

18:37.350 --> 18:39.552
DON'T. TALK ABOUT HER.

18:39.586 --> 18:41.554
DON'T MENTION HER NAME.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.831
YOU NEED
TO BE STRONGER.

18:51.864 --> 18:53.766
I DON'T WANT
ANY ADVICE FROM YOU.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.336
WHO ELSE IS THERE, HMM?

18:56.369 --> 18:59.672
THAT KNOWS YOU
AS WELL AS I DO,

18:59.706 --> 19:03.310
THAT CARES ABOUT YOU
AS MUCH AS I DO.

19:03.343 --> 19:04.577
SPENCER.

19:04.611 --> 19:06.646
YOU KNOW YOU'LL NEVER
BE HAPPY WITH HER.

19:06.679 --> 19:09.449
YOU'LL NEVER
BE AT PEACE.

19:09.482 --> 19:12.452
SHE'S HAUNTED, TOBY.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.854
I KNOW A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT THAT.

19:16.789 --> 19:18.591
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

19:18.625 --> 19:21.528
I'M THE ONLY PERSON
WHO SHOULD BE HERE.

19:21.561 --> 19:24.297
WE'RE FAMILY...

19:25.865 --> 19:27.900
WHETHER YOU LIKE
IT OR NOT.

19:33.406 --> 19:35.242
( knocking )

19:37.977 --> 19:39.312
HEY.

19:39.346 --> 19:40.747
HEY, I'VE BEEN
WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.382
YEAH, ME TOO.

19:42.415 --> 19:44.217
WHAT THE HELL
IS THIS?

19:44.251 --> 19:45.818
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

19:45.852 --> 19:48.255
I DECODED
ANOTHER SEGMENT.

19:48.288 --> 19:50.490
THIS IS ABOUT
ALISON DeLAURENTIS'S
MURDER, ISN'T IT?

19:50.523 --> 19:52.292
IT'S COMPLICATED.

19:52.325 --> 19:54.227
YEAH, I CAN TELL.

19:54.261 --> 19:55.862
HANNA, WHY ARE YOU
AND YOUR FRIENDS

19:55.895 --> 19:58.331
LOOKING INTO A CRIME
THAT SOMEBODY'S ALREADY
CONFESSED TO?

19:58.365 --> 19:59.866
DO YOU THINK
SOMEBODY ELSE KILLED HER,

19:59.899 --> 20:01.934
SOMEBODY
IN THIS VIDEO?
CALEB...

20:01.968 --> 20:04.304
NO, JUST TELL ME WHAT
THESE VIDEOS ARE ALL ABOUT

20:04.337 --> 20:05.805
AND STOP MAKING ME
IMAGINE THE WORST.

20:05.838 --> 20:08.708
WHATEVER YOU IMAGINE ISN'T
AS BAD AS IT REALLY IS.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.743
HEY, I CAN PROTECT YOU.

20:10.777 --> 20:12.579
YOU JUST--
YOU GOTTA TELL ME.

20:12.612 --> 20:13.913
I CAN'T TELL YOU.

20:13.946 --> 20:15.815
WHY? BECAUSE
I CAN'T HANDLE IT?

20:15.848 --> 20:17.550
BECAUSE I CAN'T
HANDLE IT.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.554
I'M AFRAID.

20:21.588 --> 20:23.290
I TOLD YOU,
I CAN PROTECT YOU.

20:23.323 --> 20:25.024
NO, I'M AFRAID
FOR YOU.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.894
YOU JUST GOTTA STOP
WORKING ON THESE VIDEOS,

20:27.927 --> 20:30.430
ALL RIGHT?
THEY'RE DANGEROUS.

20:31.964 --> 20:33.800
I GET THAT.

20:33.833 --> 20:36.269
ESPECIALLY SINCE THE PEOPLE
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

20:36.303 --> 20:37.970
ARE IN THIS TOWN,
WATCHING ME.

20:38.004 --> 20:41.374
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

20:41.408 --> 20:44.544
I WAS WORKING
ON THIS TODAY AT THE CAFE,

20:44.577 --> 20:46.279
AND I LOOKED UP,
AND OFFICER GARRETT

20:46.313 --> 20:47.814
WAS SITTING
TWO TABLES AWAY.

20:47.847 --> 20:49.849
WHAT ARE YOU-- HEY!

20:49.882 --> 20:51.418
HANNA, HANNA!
WHAT THE HELL!

20:51.451 --> 20:52.685
I SPENT
HOURS ON THAT.

20:56.323 --> 20:57.757
LOOK, I DON'T CARE.

20:57.790 --> 21:01.594
YOU ARE OUT
OF THE PHONE TECH
BUSINESS, AS OF NOW.

21:09.902 --> 21:12.405
HOW DARE YOU COME HERE.

21:12.439 --> 21:15.842
EMILY? I'D ASK YOU
THE SAME THING.

21:15.875 --> 21:19.412
I'M TOBY'S FRIEND.
WELL, THERE WAS A TIME
YOU WANTED TO BE MORE THAN THAT.

21:19.446 --> 21:21.448
GOOD THING HE DIDN'T
FEEL THE SAME WAY,

21:21.481 --> 21:24.351
OR THINGS WOULD BE
AWFULLY CONFUSING

21:24.384 --> 21:25.818
WITH MAYA,
WOULDN'T THEY?

21:25.852 --> 21:27.587
YOU'RE LUCKY I DON'T
TAKE THAT STICK.

21:27.620 --> 21:28.755
MM, CAREFUL, EMILY.

21:28.788 --> 21:31.324
MISPLACED ANGER
CAN BE DANGEROUS.

21:31.358 --> 21:32.592
MISPLACED?

21:32.625 --> 21:33.793
YOU SHOULD'VE LEFT
HIM ALONE.

21:33.826 --> 21:35.595
YOU ALL SHOULD'VE
LEFT HIM ALONE.

21:35.628 --> 21:37.964
YOU KNOW HOW EVERYONE
CLOSE TO YOU GETS HURT.

21:37.997 --> 21:41.033
ARE YOU THREATENING ME,
HERE, TODAY?

21:41.067 --> 21:44.837
I'M JUST STATING A FACT.

21:44.871 --> 21:46.339
EXCUSE ME.

21:48.107 --> 21:50.309
SPENCER.

21:55.114 --> 21:57.450
HEY, IS SPENCER OKAY?

21:57.484 --> 21:59.586
I HEARD TOBY CAVANAUGH
HAD A BAD ACCIDENT.

21:59.619 --> 22:03.356
YEAH. SHE'S FINE,
BUT HE BROKE HIS ARM.

22:03.390 --> 22:05.425
OH! WELL, HE'S LUCKY.

22:05.458 --> 22:07.994
YEAH. SEEMS LIKE IT.

22:08.027 --> 22:10.530
SO, ARE YOU, UH,

22:10.563 --> 22:12.565
STILL GOING ON YOUR DATE
WITH HOLDEN TONIGHT?

22:12.599 --> 22:15.702
MOM, IT'S NOT A DATE.
WE'RE JUST OLD FRIENDS
CATCHING UP.

22:15.735 --> 22:17.637
IS THERE A REASON
YOU HAVE TO GO

22:17.670 --> 22:19.706
ALL THE WAY TO PHILADELPHIA
TO CATCH UP?

22:23.175 --> 22:25.111
YEAH, I MEAN,
HOLDEN'S BEEN, LIKE,

22:25.144 --> 22:26.513
IN THE WILDS
OF PORTUGAL.

22:26.546 --> 22:28.047
I JUST FIGURED
HIS SOCIAL SKILLS

22:28.080 --> 22:29.982
COULD USE A LITTLE
SHOCK TREATMENT.

22:31.050 --> 22:33.553
SO, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

22:33.586 --> 22:37.457
UM, I THINK HE SAID
A PLACE CALLED MACELLI'S.

22:37.490 --> 22:38.825
OH, MACELLI'S.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.627
WE HAVEN'T BEEN
THERE IN YEARS.

22:40.660 --> 22:42.962
WE STOPPED THERE
WITH HOLDEN'S FAMILY

22:42.995 --> 22:45.097
ON THE WAY BACK
FROM THE CABIN AT CLEARLAKE.

22:45.131 --> 22:47.500
OH, YEAH! YEAH, I REALLY
LIKED THAT PLACE.

22:47.534 --> 22:49.702
HOW COME WE ONLY WENT
THAT ONE YEAR?

22:49.736 --> 22:51.871
MM, WELL, YOUR FATHER
HATED THAT CABIN,

22:51.904 --> 22:54.541
AND HE SWORE NOTHING COULD
EVER MAKE HIM GO BACK THERE.

22:54.574 --> 22:56.843
REALLY.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.878
SO, WE SHOULD LEAVE
AROUND 7:00?

22:58.911 --> 23:01.481
MOM, REALLY?
YOU'RE STILL DRIVING ME?

23:01.514 --> 23:03.115
COME ON, I'M NOT 12.

23:03.149 --> 23:07.386
DATE OR NOT, YOUR FATHER
IS INSISTING ON
CLOSER SUPERVISION.

23:09.121 --> 23:10.957
SO AM I.

23:10.990 --> 23:12.459
OKAY.

23:45.625 --> 23:48.060
JENNA'S RIGHT.

23:48.094 --> 23:49.962
I'M PUTTING TOBY
IN DANGER,

23:49.996 --> 23:52.198
AND I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN IT.

23:54.166 --> 23:56.068
WE'VE ALWAYS DONE
EVERYTHING WE CAN.

23:56.102 --> 24:00.072
IT'S NOT ENOUGH.
IT'LL NEVER BE ENOUGH.

24:03.676 --> 24:05.678
I NEED YOU
TO DO ME A FAVOR.

24:05.712 --> 24:07.747
ANYTHING.

24:07.780 --> 24:09.248
NO, DON'T BE
SO QUICK TO AGREE.

24:09.281 --> 24:11.250
IF YOU DO WHAT
I'M ABOUT TO ASK YOU,

24:11.283 --> 24:12.985
YOU MIGHT END UP
HATING ME,

24:13.019 --> 24:16.656
BUT THIS IS THE ONLY THING THAT
I CAN THINK OF TO SAVE TOBY.

24:18.791 --> 24:21.127
WHAT DO YOU WANT
ME TO DO?

24:37.309 --> 24:40.246
HEY. UHH.

24:40.279 --> 24:42.248
TOLD YOU,
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

24:42.281 --> 24:44.584
I'LL BE HOME TOMORROW.

24:46.986 --> 24:48.855
I'VE BEEN WANTING TO TALK.

24:50.189 --> 24:52.692
ME TOO.

24:52.725 --> 24:56.262
EMILY, WHAT'S WRONG?

25:00.967 --> 25:02.234
IT'S SPENCER.

25:02.268 --> 25:03.936
WHAT, IS SHE OKAY?

25:06.873 --> 25:08.841
BEFORE YOU AND SHE
GOT TOGETHER,

25:08.875 --> 25:10.843
SHE WAS SEEING
SOMEONE ELSE.

25:10.877 --> 25:14.781
IT WASN'T RIGHT,
AND SHE KNEW IT.

25:17.349 --> 25:20.887
BUT HE'S BACK
NOW, AND...

25:20.920 --> 25:22.221
WHAT?

25:25.992 --> 25:28.094
IT'S NOT RIGHT AGAIN.

25:32.632 --> 25:35.201
I DON'T...

25:35.234 --> 25:37.904
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

25:40.973 --> 25:42.975
WHY ARE YOU
TELLING ME THIS?

25:43.009 --> 25:45.912
BECAUSE I CAN'T
WATCH YOU GET HURT.

25:45.945 --> 25:49.949
NO. WHY ARE YOU
TELLING ME THIS?

25:49.982 --> 25:51.918
SPENCER COULDN'T.

25:51.951 --> 25:54.020
SHE'S BEEN WANTING
TO FOR A LONG TIME.

25:54.053 --> 25:55.722
LONG TIME.

25:59.291 --> 26:02.194
I'M SO SORRY, TOBY.

26:05.164 --> 26:07.600
TELL ME ONE THING.

26:10.770 --> 26:12.739
WHO IS IT?

26:16.108 --> 26:17.810
OKAY, SO I'LL BE
BACK AT 11:00.

26:17.844 --> 26:19.679
YOU KIDS
ENJOY YOURSELVES.

26:19.712 --> 26:20.947
OKAY. WE WILL.

26:24.083 --> 26:27.086
DOES IT BOTHER YOU,
LYING TO HER?

26:27.119 --> 26:28.955
OF COURSE.

26:28.988 --> 26:30.356
BUT YOU DO IT
ANYWAY.

26:30.389 --> 26:32.959
LOOK, IN THIS CASE,

26:32.992 --> 26:35.127
WHAT SHE DOESN'T KNOW
ISN'T GONNA HURT HER.

26:35.161 --> 26:37.664
WHAT'S GOING ON?
ARE YOU TRYING

26:37.697 --> 26:39.365
TO CONVINCE ME THAT WE
SHOULDN'T BE DOING THIS?

26:39.398 --> 26:41.901
NO, JUST MAKING SURE
IT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU.

26:41.934 --> 26:43.970
WHY? WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES THAT MAKE?

26:44.003 --> 26:46.739
BECAUSE THIS
IS IMPORTANT TO ME.

26:46.773 --> 26:48.107
OH, IT IS TO ME, TOO.

26:52.044 --> 26:53.780
SO, WHAT DO YOUR FRIENDS
THINK YOU'RE DOING

26:53.813 --> 26:55.982
WHEN YOU'RE OUT WITH ME?
LYING TO THEM, TOO?

26:56.015 --> 26:57.717
NO, THEY KNOW.

26:57.750 --> 27:00.319
THE ARE A LITTLE CURIOUS
ABOUT YOU, THOUGH.

27:00.352 --> 27:02.154
ME?
MM-HMM.

27:02.188 --> 27:04.223
YOU'RE A GOOD-LOOKING GUY.

27:04.256 --> 27:06.392
YOU'RE PRETENDING
TO GO OUT WITH ME

27:06.425 --> 27:08.327
WHILE YOU'RE SNEAKING OFF
SOMEWHERE ELSE,

27:08.360 --> 27:11.731
NOT TELLING ME OR YOUR PARENTS
WHO YOU'RE REALLY SEE--

27:11.764 --> 27:14.767
OH! SO THEY THINK
I'M GAY.

27:14.801 --> 27:16.102
NO.
YES.

27:16.135 --> 27:20.006
NO! OKAY, YEAH.

27:20.039 --> 27:22.241
LOOK, IT'S JUST--

27:22.274 --> 27:24.744
ARIA, I'M NOT. GAY.

27:27.279 --> 27:30.016
OKAY, WELL,
WHAT ARE YOU?

27:30.049 --> 27:32.051
LATE. SEE YOU
AT 11:00.

27:32.084 --> 27:33.753
BYE.

27:56.375 --> 27:59.245
I'M JUST SAYING I PUT
A LOT OF EFFORT
INTO MY STORY.

27:59.278 --> 28:01.280
I'M NOT DENYING THAT.
YOU'RE A GOOD WRITER.

28:01.313 --> 28:03.950
THEN WHY THE "B"?

28:03.983 --> 28:06.753
I GUESS I FOUND IT
A LITTLE UNBELIEVABLE.

28:06.786 --> 28:08.888
THE GUY LEAVES
HIS FIANCEE AT DINNER

28:08.921 --> 28:11.490
TO FOLLOW A WOMAN
HE ONLY MET FIVE MINUTES AGO.

28:11.523 --> 28:13.259
HE FELT HE HAD
TO GET TO KNOW HER.

28:13.292 --> 28:14.861
HE WAS
AT HIS REHEARSAL DINNER.

28:14.894 --> 28:16.729
HE WAS GETTING MARRIED
THE NEXT DAY.

28:16.763 --> 28:18.497
EXACTLY.

28:18.530 --> 28:20.332
EXACTLY WHAT?

28:20.366 --> 28:22.168
TRUE LOVE SAVES HIM
FROM MAKING

28:22.201 --> 28:24.270
THE BIGGEST MISTAKE
OF HIS LIFE.

28:24.303 --> 28:26.172
DO YOU THINK
THAT'S REALISTIC?

28:26.205 --> 28:28.975
I THINK IT'S ROMANTIC.

28:29.008 --> 28:31.110
LIFE ISN'T
ALWAYS ROMANTIC.

28:31.143 --> 28:33.746
SOMETIMES
IT'S REALISTIC.

28:33.780 --> 28:38.250
SOMETIMES THINGS DON'T WORK OUT
THE WAY YOU WANT THEM TO.

28:43.155 --> 28:44.991
WE ARE STILL TALKING
ABOUT MY STORY,

28:45.024 --> 28:46.893
RIGHT, MR. FITZ?

28:46.926 --> 28:48.895
YES. SORRY.

28:48.928 --> 28:50.763
UM...

28:50.797 --> 28:52.364
I'LL GIVE IT ANOTHER LOOK.

28:52.398 --> 28:53.766
THANK YOU.

28:53.800 --> 28:56.002
I GUESS THAT'S ALL
I CAN ASK FOR.

29:00.006 --> 29:01.073
"BE BOLD...

29:02.809 --> 29:04.476
AND MIGHTY FORCES
WILL COME TO YOUR AID."

29:04.510 --> 29:07.213
EXCUSE ME?

29:07.246 --> 29:09.015
IT'S A QUOTE.

29:09.048 --> 29:10.950
I FORGOT
WHO SAID IT...

29:12.484 --> 29:14.987
BUT THAT'S WHAT
MY STORY'S ABOUT.

29:24.463 --> 29:27.867
* PUT YOUR HANDS
 IN THE WATER *

29:27.900 --> 29:30.870
* WATCH THEM
 GO UNDER *

29:34.506 --> 29:38.010
* PUT YOUR HANDS
 TO THE LIGHT *

29:38.044 --> 29:41.313
* WATCH THE LIGHT

29:43.182 --> 29:47.486
* COME THROUGH

29:48.554 --> 29:51.223
* AND I

29:51.257 --> 29:55.561
* WILL LET YOU GO

29:58.297 --> 30:01.067
* AND I

30:01.100 --> 30:05.171
* WILL LET YOU GO

30:09.275 --> 30:12.578
* PUT YOUR TIME
 ON THE TABLE *

30:12.611 --> 30:16.015
* SEE WHO'LL
 SIT DOWN WITH YOU *

30:23.255 --> 30:25.892
Aria: LISTEN, I REALLY
 DON'T WANT TO THINK

30:25.925 --> 30:28.127
ABOUT US BEING OVER, BUT...

30:28.160 --> 30:30.129
YOU KNOW, WHETHER
 WE ARE OR WE AREN'T,

30:30.162 --> 30:33.065
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE
 SHOULD DISCUSS FACE TO FACE.

30:33.099 --> 30:36.202
SO, MEET ME
 TONIGHT AT 8:00

30:36.235 --> 30:38.871
IN FRONT OF THE CLOCK
 BY RITTENHOUSE SQUARE.

30:38.905 --> 30:43.309
IF YOU COME, IT MEANS THAT
 THERE'S STILL A CHANCE FOR US,

30:43.342 --> 30:45.844
AND IF NOT...
 ( beep )

30:48.147 --> 30:49.548
* AND I

30:49.581 --> 30:53.552
* WILL LET YOU GO

30:58.324 --> 31:00.626
* AND I

31:00.659 --> 31:05.932
* WILL LET YOU GO

31:10.937 --> 31:12.171
HEY, THERE.

31:12.204 --> 31:13.305
HEY.

31:15.074 --> 31:18.911
HMM. DID YOU AND THE BLENDER
HAVE A FIGHT TODAY?

31:18.945 --> 31:21.047
NO, BUT CALEB
AND I DID.

31:21.080 --> 31:25.351
OH. OKAY. YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT?

31:25.384 --> 31:27.286
NOT REALLY.

31:30.322 --> 31:32.291
I DO.

31:32.324 --> 31:34.460
IT'S NOTHING.

31:36.262 --> 31:38.364
DID YOU EVER KEEP
A SECRET FROM DAD?

31:40.399 --> 31:43.069
WELL, APPARENTLY
NOT AS MANY
AS HE KEPT FROM ME.

31:46.205 --> 31:48.107
YEAH, I GUESS
I KEPT A FEW.

31:48.140 --> 31:49.441
LIKE WHAT?

31:52.344 --> 31:54.313
REMEMBER THAT TIME
HE SURPRISED ME

31:54.346 --> 31:56.182
BY PAINTING
OUR BEDROOM?

31:56.215 --> 31:58.417
YEAH, THAT WEIRD GREEN COLOR
THAT LOOKED LIKE PUKE.

31:58.450 --> 31:59.618
YEAH, WELL,

31:59.651 --> 32:02.188
HE WAS SO PROUD
OF THE JOB THAT HE DID.

32:02.221 --> 32:05.357
I DIDN'T HAVE THE HEART
TO TELL HIM I HATED IT.

32:05.391 --> 32:08.027
ANYTHING BIGGER?

32:09.428 --> 32:12.664
ONCE, STEVE ANDERSON
MADE A PASS AT ME.

32:12.698 --> 32:15.534
WHAT? MOM, THAT'S
DAD'S BEST FRIEND.

32:15.567 --> 32:17.469
WHICH IS WHY
I KEPT IT A SECRET...

32:17.503 --> 32:20.272
AFTER TELLING STEVE
THAT I WOULD SPILL IT

32:20.306 --> 32:22.408
IF HE EVER
TRIED IT AGAIN.

32:22.441 --> 32:24.543
BUT I KNEW YOUR FATHER
WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW

32:24.576 --> 32:27.513
THAT IF I TOLD HIM,
IT WOULD HURT HIM.

32:27.546 --> 32:31.017
AND IF I DIDN'T,
IT WOULDN'T.

32:37.589 --> 32:40.259
WHAT'S THE BIG SECRET
YOU'RE KEEPING FROM CALEB?

32:45.664 --> 32:47.233
DID YOU LIE TO HIM?

32:48.567 --> 32:50.469
NO.

32:52.704 --> 32:55.007
HANNA.

32:55.041 --> 32:56.742
IT'S NOTHING.

32:56.775 --> 32:58.710
I HAVE TO GO MEET MONA.

33:07.186 --> 33:10.389
YOU FEELING
ALL RIGHT?

33:10.422 --> 33:11.757
SOMETHING
I CAN GET YOU?

33:11.790 --> 33:14.260
JUST SOME ANSWERS.

33:14.293 --> 33:16.262
YEAH, SURE.
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?

33:16.295 --> 33:19.565
YOU AND SPENCER.

33:19.598 --> 33:21.433
OH.

33:23.402 --> 33:26.272
WELL, I KISSED HER.
I'M NOT GONNA DENY THAT.

33:26.305 --> 33:27.573
BIG OF YOU.

33:27.606 --> 33:29.141
WELL, I WAS UNDER
THE IMPRESSION

33:29.175 --> 33:30.409
THAT YOU TWO
WERE OVER, SO...

33:30.442 --> 33:31.610
DID SHE TELL YOU THAT?

33:31.643 --> 33:35.481
YEAH, SHE DID,
ACTUALLY.

33:35.514 --> 33:37.716
YOU SHOULD GO NOW.

33:37.749 --> 33:39.351
COME ON, MATE.

33:39.385 --> 33:41.553
I'M JUST SAYING,
I MAY HAVE BROKEN
MY LEFT ARM,

33:41.587 --> 33:44.156
BUT MY RIGHT ARM
IS FINE.

33:55.634 --> 33:58.737
I CAN'T WAIT
TO DOWN A COUPLE SHOTS

33:58.770 --> 34:01.440
AND FLUSH NOEL KAHN
OUT OF MY SYSTEM.

34:01.473 --> 34:03.575
WAIT, I THOUGHT
YOU LOST YOUR FAKE I.D.

34:03.609 --> 34:05.544
I'VE GOT ANOTHER ONE
I COULD USE

34:05.577 --> 34:08.347
FROM AN OLD FRIEND.
WHAT?

34:12.684 --> 34:14.686
LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY
MADE A NEW FRIEND.

34:14.719 --> 34:17.389
DOUBLE REBOUND,
I GUESS.

34:20.292 --> 34:21.560
DON'T TAKE IT SO HARD.

34:21.592 --> 34:23.161
I'M THE ONE
THAT JUST GOT DUMPED.

34:23.195 --> 34:27.498
NO. NO, I GET IT.
I JUST...

34:27.533 --> 34:30.402
I DIDN'T EXPECT TO SEE
THOSE TWO HOOKING UP.

34:34.706 --> 34:36.808
COME ON,
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

34:36.842 --> 34:38.444
YEAH.

34:47.686 --> 34:51.190
* I'VE SAILED
 A THOUSAND SHIPS

34:51.223 --> 34:55.194
* IN SEARCH OF YOU

34:55.226 --> 35:00.499
* TRAVELED
 TO DISTANT LANDS *

35:00.532 --> 35:03.769
* I DOVE FOR SUNKEN GOLD I

35:03.802 --> 35:05.737
* TOOK WHAT I COULD HOLD

35:05.771 --> 35:07.673
* BUT YOU'RE

35:07.706 --> 35:10.676
* STILL THE GREATEST TREASURE

35:10.709 --> 35:15.647
* I'VE HELD
 IN MY HAND *

35:15.681 --> 35:18.150
* A TATTERED PHOTOGRAPH

35:18.184 --> 35:22.488
* MY POCKET HOLDS

35:22.521 --> 35:26.525
* I KEEP YOU SECRETLY

35:26.558 --> 35:31.363
* I'VE STUDIED EVERY LINE
 YOU'RE *

35:31.397 --> 35:34.933
* ETCHED UPON MY MIND
 FOR *

35:34.966 --> 35:38.270
* NOT A MILLION SOLDIERS

35:38.304 --> 35:43.575
* COULD TAKE YOU FROM ME

35:43.609 --> 35:48.447
* AND MY LOVE

35:48.480 --> 35:49.781
ARIA?

35:49.815 --> 35:53.619
* THE REASON I SURVIVE

35:54.886 --> 35:59.725
* TRUST WE'LL BE TOGETHER

35:59.758 --> 36:03.595
* SOON

36:04.763 --> 36:10.236
* SHOULD OUR

36:10.269 --> 36:15.441
* FIRE TURN TO DARK

36:15.474 --> 36:19.945
* TAKE MY HEART

36:19.978 --> 36:24.283
* WITH YOU

36:33.525 --> 36:35.861
I DIDN'T KNOW
IF YOU'D COME.

36:35.894 --> 36:37.563
I DIDN'T, EITHER.

36:41.367 --> 36:43.569
ARIA, THIS IS DANGEROUS
FOR THE BOTH OF US...

36:43.602 --> 36:44.736
I KNOW.

36:44.770 --> 36:47.439
BUT I'M ONLY WORRIED
ABOUT YOU.

36:47.473 --> 36:49.608
I WANT YOU
TO BE SAFE,

36:49.641 --> 36:51.477
TO BE HAPPY,

36:51.510 --> 36:54.913
AND I WANT YOU TO BE
SURE THAT THIS,

36:54.946 --> 36:58.484
THAT WE,
ARE WHAT YOU WANT.

36:58.517 --> 37:01.920
THERE'S ONLY ONE PLACE
WHERE I CAN BE SURE OF THAT.

37:01.953 --> 37:03.455
WHERE?

37:03.489 --> 37:05.857
WITH YOU.

37:20.539 --> 37:22.941
WE'RE CRAZY.
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

37:22.974 --> 37:25.744
( laughs ) I KNOW.

37:26.912 --> 37:28.947
SO, HOW ARE WE
GONNA DO THIS?

37:28.980 --> 37:31.049
WE CAN'T SPEND
THE REST OF OUR LIVES

37:31.082 --> 37:33.652
ON SIDEWALKS
IN THE RAIN.

37:33.685 --> 37:35.787
I HAVE AN IDEA.

37:38.990 --> 37:41.960
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
SHE DESTROYED
THE FLASH DRIVE?

37:41.993 --> 37:43.061
I MEAN SHE
VAPORIZED IT.

37:43.094 --> 37:44.062
NOTHING LEFT
BUT SMOKE.

37:44.095 --> 37:45.664
BUT WHY WOULD
SHE DO THAT?

37:45.697 --> 37:46.898
THAT WAS
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.

37:46.932 --> 37:49.635
OBVIOUSLY IT
WAS IMPORTANT, OKAY?

37:49.668 --> 37:52.037
THAT'S WHY I KEPT
A COPY OF THE FILES.

37:52.070 --> 37:54.005
YOU DID?
YEAH.

37:54.039 --> 37:56.041
AND I'LL KEEP WORKING
ON THEM, TOO,

37:56.074 --> 37:57.909
IF WE KEEP IT
A SECRET FROM HANNA.

37:57.943 --> 37:59.678
WHY?

37:59.711 --> 38:02.381
BECAUSE I LOVE HER
AND I WANT TO PROTECT HER,

38:02.414 --> 38:04.550
AND IT SEEMS LIKE FINDING OUT
WHAT'S ON THAT PHONE

38:04.583 --> 38:05.984
IS THE BEST WAY
TO ACCOMPLISH THAT.

38:06.017 --> 38:07.919
NO, I DON'T WANT
TO LIE TO HANNA, CALEB,

38:07.953 --> 38:09.688
AND I DON'T WANT
TO LIE TO YOU.

38:09.721 --> 38:11.423
YEAH, ABOUT THAT.

38:11.457 --> 38:13.459
IF I'M GOING TO DO THIS,

38:13.492 --> 38:15.727
I'M GONNA NEED
SOMETHING FROM YOU.

38:15.761 --> 38:17.496
WHAT?

38:17.529 --> 38:19.398
ANSWERS.

38:19.431 --> 38:22.668
STARTING WITH WHAT IS IT
THAT HANNA'S SO AFRAID
OF ME FINDING?

38:34.780 --> 38:35.847
( honk )

38:37.683 --> 38:38.884
HEY.

38:38.917 --> 38:40.786
HEY.

38:40.819 --> 38:42.854
WHERE'S HOLDEN?

38:42.888 --> 38:44.956
UH...

38:46.692 --> 38:48.727
HE--

38:48.760 --> 38:49.761
ARIA.

38:51.497 --> 38:54.633
SORRY, SORRY!
ARIA REALLY WANTED DESSERT,

38:54.666 --> 38:57.836
BUT WE DIDN'T WANT TO MISS YOU,
SO I WENT MYSELF.

38:57.869 --> 39:00.038
YOU WERE OFF BY A BLOCK,
BY THE WAY.

39:00.071 --> 39:01.973
OH! MY MISTAKE.

39:02.007 --> 39:03.975
YOU KNOW ME
AND MY DIRECTIONS.

39:04.009 --> 39:05.477
PEANUT BUTTER
AND CHOCOLATE, RIGHT?

39:05.511 --> 39:07.546
UH-HUH. YEAH. THANK YOU.

39:07.579 --> 39:09.615
COFFEE OR VANILLA?

39:09.648 --> 39:11.650
I WENT FOR
THE CLASSICS.

39:11.683 --> 39:12.751
THANK YOU.

39:25.831 --> 39:28.099
SO, WHAT EXACTLY
DID YOU TELL HIM?

39:28.133 --> 39:30.402
AS LITTLE
AS POSSIBLE.

39:30.436 --> 39:31.937
THAT JENNA'S TRYING
TO FRAME US

39:31.970 --> 39:33.171
FOR ALISON'S MURDER,

39:33.204 --> 39:34.673
THAT GARRETT'S
HELPING HER,

39:34.706 --> 39:36.542
AND THAT, DESPITE
WHAT THE POLICE BELIEVE,

39:36.575 --> 39:38.076
IAN'S CONFESSION PROBABLY
DOESN'T TELL THE WHOLE STORY.

39:39.745 --> 39:41.413
AND THEN I FIGURED
THE REST WAS SOMETHING

39:41.447 --> 39:42.948
THAT ALL OF US
NEEDED TO TALK ABOUT.

39:42.981 --> 39:46.184
ALL OF US EXCEPT HANNA.

39:46.217 --> 39:47.919
I DON'T FEEL ANY BETTER
ABOUT THIS THAN YOU DO,

39:47.953 --> 39:49.855
BUT WE DID
THE RIGHT THING.

39:49.888 --> 39:51.890
CALEB KNOWS
WHAT HE HAS TO KNOW.

39:51.923 --> 39:54.159
MAYBE WHAT HE GOT
WON'T BE ANY GOOD,

39:54.192 --> 39:56.027
AND WE WON'T HAVE
TO USE HIM ANYMORE.

39:56.061 --> 39:58.564
SO, WE'RE HOPING
THAT NOTHING'S ON HERE?

39:59.731 --> 40:00.866
( beep )

40:03.869 --> 40:05.771
DANCE,
YOU LITTLE BASTARDS.

40:05.804 --> 40:07.773
THAT'S WEIRD.
 WHAT?

40:07.806 --> 40:09.841
WHAT'S INSIDE IT?

40:09.875 --> 40:11.710
( door opens )
 HEY, SHH! SOMEONE'S HERE.

40:11.743 --> 40:12.744
ALISON?

40:14.713 --> 40:16.682
Garrett: YOU'RE GOING DOWN.
Ian: NO, NO, NO.

40:16.715 --> 40:19.518
WE ARE ALL
 GOING DOWN.

40:19.551 --> 40:20.652
WHAT?

40:21.887 --> 40:23.889
YOU TAPED US
 DOING THIS?

40:23.922 --> 40:25.691
WHAT THE--
 WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

40:25.724 --> 40:27.459
NOW WE KNOW WHY
HE HID THE CAMERA.

40:27.493 --> 40:29.060
HEY, ONCE YOU'RE
 A MEMBER OF THE CLUB,

40:29.094 --> 40:30.696
YOU'RE ALWAYS
 A MEMBER OF THE CLUB.

40:30.729 --> 40:32.998
JUST MAKING SURE
 YOU'RE IN AS DEEP AS I AM.

40:33.031 --> 40:34.866
Jenna: SHE'S
 COMING UPSTAIRS!

40:34.900 --> 40:37.235
THAT'S ALISON ABOUT
TO WALK IN AND FIND THEM.

40:37.268 --> 40:40.105
THIS COULD BE THE LAST
FEW SECONDS OF HER LIFE.

40:42.908 --> 40:46.011
I'M NOT SURE I WANT CALEB
TO GET ANY MORE.

40:46.044 --> 40:48.113
YEAH, BUT IF HE DOES...

40:48.146 --> 40:52.083
MAYBE WE REALLY CAN
GIVE THIS TO THE POLICE.

40:52.117 --> 40:53.852
MAYBE EVERYTHING
CAN FINALLY BE OVER.

40:53.885 --> 40:55.987
OVER OVER?

40:56.021 --> 40:57.623
( car door closes )

41:02.160 --> 41:04.563
I THOUGHT TOBY
WAS GETTING BACK

41:04.596 --> 41:07.533
FROM THE HOSPITAL
LATER TODAY.

41:07.566 --> 41:09.701
SO DID I.

41:18.544 --> 41:20.746
WHERE'D HE GO?

41:29.254 --> 41:31.857
WHY WOULD HE
LEAVE THE KEYS?

41:47.105 --> 41:49.908
SPENCE, WHAT
DOES IT SAY?

41:51.643 --> 41:54.045
HE'S GONE.
