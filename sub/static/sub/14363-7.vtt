WEBVTT

00:04.848 --> 00:05.724
Thanksgiving.

00:05.802 --> 00:08.195
What do the Hecks and the
Pilgrims have in common?

00:08.289 --> 00:10.449
No indoor plumbing.

00:10.541 --> 00:12.668
How many times do I have to tell you?

00:12.762 --> 00:14.632
Coffeepot is stream.

00:14.709 --> 00:16.674
Ice tray is mist.

00:16.764 --> 00:17.386
Mm.

00:17.486 --> 00:20.663
Okay, listen, Mike. I was thinking.

00:20.771 --> 00:22.291
You know how we always say

00:22.343 --> 00:24.268
only losers and sad, pathetic people

00:24.337 --> 00:25.914
go out to dinner for Thanksgiving?

00:26.003 --> 00:27.818
So are you saying we're
going out this year?

00:27.881 --> 00:30.167
No. Well, yes, but not 'cause we're losers.

00:30.272 --> 00:32.131
'Cause we have a floor
sink and a tiny table.

00:32.194 --> 00:33.946
Don't exactly sound like winners.

00:34.947 --> 00:36.674
Okay, just... just follow me here.

00:36.760 --> 00:39.189
I saw an ad in the paper
that king Henry's feast

00:39.313 --> 00:42.542
is doing a Thanksgiving buffet,
and it's only $7.99 a person.

00:42.542 --> 00:44.525
They're doing all the Thanksgiving staples,

00:44.525 --> 00:47.141
plus their full complement
of international cuisine.

00:47.176 --> 00:48.484
And as an added bonus,

00:48.581 --> 00:50.085
we don't have to do the
dishes in the bathtub.

00:50.197 --> 00:52.328
You don't have to convince
me to leave this house.

00:52.391 --> 00:54.214
Long as I get some turkey, I'm fine.

00:54.214 --> 00:56.537
Wait a minute. What's going on?

00:56.609 --> 00:58.534
Are we not having
Thanksgiving at home this year?

00:58.614 --> 01:00.471
Sue, take a look around this place.

01:00.568 --> 01:01.912
But we have to stay home.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.259
Thanksgiving's not Thanksgiving

01:03.314 --> 01:05.292
without frugal hoosier canned corn,

01:05.397 --> 01:08.410
safeway boxed stuffing,
and CVS pumpkin pie.

01:08.476 --> 01:10.066
Brick, did you hear this?

01:10.166 --> 01:10.864
Mom and dad say

01:10.919 --> 01:12.710
we're having Thanksgiving at a restaurant.

01:12.765 --> 01:14.399
Well, I'm actually okay with that.

01:14.504 --> 01:16.278
Of course, I'll have to
run it by Cindy first.

01:16.361 --> 01:17.130
Why?

01:17.199 --> 01:18.389
Well, it's a major holiday.

01:18.469 --> 01:20.339
We can't just spend time with my family.

01:20.419 --> 01:22.291
You know what? Let's not
make a big deal about this.

01:22.393 --> 01:24.047
I already got Cindy breathing down my neck.

01:24.116 --> 01:25.085
I don't need you guys.

01:26.209 --> 01:27.936
Axl! Did you hear this?

01:28.016 --> 01:30.053
Mom and dad say we're having
Thanksgiving at a restaurant.

01:30.130 --> 01:31.719
Oh. So mom's not cooking?

01:31.806 --> 01:34.063
At last... something to
be truly thankful for.

01:34.184 --> 01:36.110
Oh, and listen, Axl...
I invited Devin Levin

01:36.168 --> 01:37.343
to come down and have dinner with us,

01:37.343 --> 01:39.125
so I'm gonna need you to
drive her home from school.

01:39.216 --> 01:40.289
No! No way.

01:40.354 --> 01:42.487
I'm not driving Devin
Levin here from college.

01:42.570 --> 01:44.612
I told you a million times!
I'm not telling you again!

01:44.667 --> 01:47.450
I know this seems like an
extreme reaction, even for Axl,

01:47.533 --> 01:50.638
but this Devin Levin battle
had been raging for two years.

01:50.673 --> 01:52.693
Mm. Axl.

01:53.507 --> 01:56.325
My hair person's cousin's
niece's daughter is from Idaho,

01:56.385 --> 01:58.298
and she just started at east Indiana,

01:58.396 --> 01:59.977
so since she really
doesn't know anybody yet,

02:00.018 --> 02:01.765
I thought it'd be nice if
you called her just to say hi.

02:01.873 --> 02:02.880
Well, think again,

02:02.968 --> 02:05.320
'cause there's no way I'm
calling some uggo from Idaho.

02:05.396 --> 02:09.300
Did you ever call Devin Levin?
I asked you six months ago.

02:09.395 --> 02:11.542
Mom, I don't have time. I'm studying.

02:11.608 --> 02:13.029
Axl, this is getting embarrassing.

02:13.079 --> 02:15.081
You have to call her
before my roots grow out.

02:17.073 --> 02:19.281
I'm sorry, but I'm not leaving that girl

02:19.359 --> 02:20.513
stranded for Thanksgiving.

02:20.615 --> 02:21.986
That's not how we roll.

02:22.049 --> 02:24.827
I'm asking you to do this,
and you do for family.

02:24.921 --> 02:26.612
But you don't do for hairdresser's family.

02:26.675 --> 02:28.765
Look, it's hard to find a good hair person

02:28.839 --> 02:30.161
who works out of her garage,

02:30.263 --> 02:32.238
but I did it, and you're doing this.

02:32.320 --> 02:34.500
Wait... so it's not
gonna be just our family?

02:34.608 --> 02:36.616
It's not just our family anyway.

02:36.686 --> 02:38.363
Brick's bringing Cindy and Darrin's coming.

02:38.426 --> 02:39.297
Ugh.

02:39.385 --> 02:41.976
Wait. Sue's bringing a date
and Brick's bringing a date?

02:42.064 --> 02:44.173
That means Devin Levin's
gonna think it's a date.

02:44.250 --> 02:45.891
Relax. I didn't tell her it was a date.

02:45.990 --> 02:47.866
Mom  look at me.

02:47.949 --> 02:49.800
If I pick a girl up, she's
gonna think it's a date.

02:49.880 --> 02:52.291
All right, I smoothed
things over with Cindy.

02:52.371 --> 02:54.093
She's gonna spend Thanksgiving with us,

02:54.173 --> 02:55.931
but I'm gonna have to do
Christmas with her folks.

02:56.006 --> 02:57.483
I think for new year's,

02:57.483 --> 02:58.890
we're just gonna go skiing with her Uncle.

03:01.988 --> 03:03.329
So, Thanksgiving day arrived,

03:03.453 --> 03:06.055
and Axl finally agreed
to pick up Devin Levin.

03:06.138 --> 03:08.052
He might not always show it,

03:08.123 --> 03:10.311
but deep down, he's a perfect gentleman.

03:16.864 --> 03:17.804
I was right here.

03:17.881 --> 03:19.302
So-rry!

03:19.382 --> 03:21.187
How would I know it's you?
We don't even know each other.

03:21.276 --> 03:22.503
I'm just giving you a
ride. I have a girlfriend.

03:22.627 --> 03:24.100
O... Kay.

03:28.888 --> 03:30.305
Aren't those your pregnancy pants?

03:30.377 --> 03:32.069
They used to be my pregnancy pants.

03:32.143 --> 03:33.876
Now they're my holiday pants.

03:33.967 --> 03:34.871
Ah.

03:34.951 --> 03:36.907
Well, mom, do you mind if I ask you

03:36.956 --> 03:38.314
kind of a serious question?

03:38.413 --> 03:40.678
Uh... Sure.

03:43.359 --> 03:45.852
Does dad not like Darrin?

03:46.574 --> 03:47.952
What?! Pfft!

03:47.952 --> 03:51.019
Of course dad likes Darrin.
Why would you say that?

03:51.107 --> 03:53.887
W-well, the other day,
you were talking about

03:53.964 --> 03:55.492
who was coming to Thanksgiving dinner,

03:55.570 --> 03:57.697
and after you said Darrin was coming,

03:57.775 --> 03:59.209
dad said, "ugh."

03:59.270 --> 04:01.261
No. He didn't say, "ugh."

04:01.327 --> 04:04.204
He said... "Ah."

04:04.282 --> 04:06.760
You know, like, "ah, that's nice."

04:06.846 --> 04:10.314
No. It was definitely an "ugh."
I remember it very vividly.

04:10.380 --> 04:13.546
You said, "Darrin is
coming," and dad said, "ugh."

04:13.665 --> 04:15.373
Look, Sue, don't take it personally.

04:15.498 --> 04:18.031
Your dad likes us, and that's about it.

04:18.105 --> 04:19.839
And some days, not even us.

04:27.015 --> 04:29.715
So, are we going right to the restaurant,

04:29.820 --> 04:31.632
or are we stopping at your house first?!

04:33.860 --> 04:35.088
What?

04:35.088 --> 04:36.199
I was just wondering...

04:36.199 --> 04:37.803
are we going straight to the King's Feast,

04:37.850 --> 04:39.227
or are we stopping at your house first?

04:39.331 --> 04:42.737
Uh, no, we will not be
stopping at my house first.

04:42.836 --> 04:44.271
Nice try.

04:44.365 --> 04:45.301
Well, out of respect for the King,

04:45.383 --> 04:46.913
I better get out of my hoop clothes.

04:47.002 --> 04:49.425
Okay.

04:56.983 --> 04:58.831
Can't forget my seat belt.

04:58.929 --> 04:59.865
Safety first.

05:03.881 --> 05:06.048
Could've sworn I had a
bag of funyuns in here.

05:06.155 --> 05:07.941
I always travel with funyuns.

05:08.024 --> 05:10.035
They're like fun onions. They're funyuns!

05:10.124 --> 05:11.751
Ooh! Bingo!

05:18.843 --> 05:20.299
You do realize we're eating dinner

05:20.343 --> 05:22.807
in like less than an hour, right?

05:22.902 --> 05:24.595
Okay, dad.

05:28.332 --> 05:29.625
You know, I got to say,

05:29.736 --> 05:31.957
it was really cool of your mom
to invite me to Thanksgiving.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.883
I mean, I would've been totally fine

05:33.960 --> 05:34.833
just hanging out in my dorm.

05:34.888 --> 05:36.619
We could
still make that happen.

05:36.679 --> 05:37.829
Yeah, you know,

05:37.912 --> 05:40.238
I can pretty much cook
anything on a hot plate.

05:40.333 --> 05:43.007
The other night, I made
brownies and lasagna.

05:43.113 --> 05:45.139
You can't make brownies on a hot plate.

05:45.244 --> 05:47.320
Sure you can. You can make
anything on a hot plate.

05:47.424 --> 05:49.171
All you need is heat and the will to do it.

05:49.286 --> 05:50.597
Hmm.

05:52.000 --> 05:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:00.691 --> 06:01.740
You ready?

06:01.803 --> 06:03.404
Yep. Just waiting for Brick's girlfriend.

06:03.512 --> 06:06.259
No matter how many times I say
that, it still sounds weird.

06:06.368 --> 06:08.697
Uh, you know, you guys don't have to drive.

06:08.744 --> 06:10.247
We can all ride in Darrin's pickup.

06:10.302 --> 06:12.166
It's 34 degrees out.

06:12.276 --> 06:13.958
There's a tarp to keep us warm.

06:14.021 --> 06:15.988
We can all fit in dad's car, Sue.

06:16.100 --> 06:18.763
Okay, fine, but it's guys in
the front and girls in the back

06:18.763 --> 06:20.494
so that dad and Darrin can talk.

06:20.557 --> 06:22.118
About what?

06:29.321 --> 06:30.218
Hi, Cindy.

06:30.332 --> 06:31.188
I like your dress.

06:31.299 --> 06:33.021
It has turkeys on it.

06:36.676 --> 06:37.817
What kind of parents

06:37.833 --> 06:40.469
just dump their 12-year-old
on Thanksgiving and take off?

06:40.552 --> 06:42.329
You're just mad you
didn't think of it first.

06:42.412 --> 06:43.825
Mm.

06:48.317 --> 06:49.708
Pretty long line.

06:49.807 --> 06:52.705
You know where there are no lines? Home.

06:52.790 --> 06:54.273
It's fine.

06:54.344 --> 06:56.823
Look, that table's getting
ready to leave. I can feel it.

06:56.876 --> 06:58.960
Hey, let's all give them the stink eye,

06:59.021 --> 06:59.979
get them to move along.

07:03.278 --> 07:05.266
Oh, crap. They're heading
for the appetizers.

07:05.382 --> 07:07.730
They're starting the
whole process over again.

07:07.815 --> 07:09.023
We're never gonna eat.

07:09.117 --> 07:12.153
We have a table for five.
Anyone with a party of five?

07:12.263 --> 07:12.944
Oh!

07:13.023 --> 07:14.899
One, two, three, four, five.

07:15.026 --> 07:16.536
Six.

07:17.572 --> 07:19.092
Hey, Darrin, um,

07:19.155 --> 07:22.026
can I see you by the
king's gumballs, please?

07:23.246 --> 07:25.218
What's up?

07:25.218 --> 07:28.102
Okay, so, I was just thinking,
since it's Thanksgiving

07:27.987 --> 07:30.775
and, you know, your first
major holiday with my family,

07:30.869 --> 07:32.418
maybe you could just...

07:32.594 --> 07:34.514
Kick it up a notch.

07:34.723 --> 07:36.124
Kick what up a notch?

07:36.201 --> 07:37.847
Uh... Nothing specific,

07:37.929 --> 07:40.326
but if you could just
be a little bit better.

07:40.422 --> 07:41.536
But not so much better

07:41.608 --> 07:42.878
that it looks like you're trying too hard,

07:42.962 --> 07:44.429
but better than you are right now.

07:44.525 --> 07:45.977
Not that you're not great.

07:47.169 --> 07:49.927
I'm not exactly sure what
you're asking me, but okay.

07:50.009 --> 07:50.901
Mm-hmm.

07:50.974 --> 07:53.408
Shoot. Now I feel like
you're gonna do too much.

07:53.502 --> 07:55.224
So don't even worry about it.

07:55.301 --> 07:56.980
Just forget everything I said

07:57.049 --> 07:58.766
and be yourself, like you normally are.

07:58.875 --> 08:01.234
But a little bit better.

08:02.408 --> 08:03.532
Okay.

08:06.085 --> 08:08.347
I really like that stuffed pink flounder.

08:08.430 --> 08:10.297
Flounders are my favorite animal.

08:10.372 --> 08:12.226
Then the flounder, you shall have.

08:18.479 --> 08:19.628
Hmm.

08:24.391 --> 08:25.440
I'll give it one more shot.

08:29.383 --> 08:31.245
Okay, well, I'll sit next to mom,

08:31.302 --> 08:33.058
and Brick can sit next to Cindy,

08:33.149 --> 08:34.413
and then...

08:34.515 --> 08:36.508
Darrin, why don't you sit next to my dad?

08:37.486 --> 08:39.298
We're here!

08:39.428 --> 08:41.157
Next stop... food coma. Lates.

08:41.157 --> 08:42.548
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Where are you going?

08:42.643 --> 08:44.734
We haven't even said hi to Devin Levin.

08:44.828 --> 08:47.010
I got to say, it's so
nice to finally meet you.

08:47.139 --> 08:48.550
Sorry it took so long.

08:48.655 --> 08:51.156
Oh, no. It's all good.
Thanks for having me.

08:51.250 --> 08:52.927
Sure! So, let's see.

08:52.927 --> 08:56.184
You're my hair person's
cousin's niece's daughter.

08:56.277 --> 09:00.820
So that means your mother's
aunt is cousin to my hairdresser.

09:00.911 --> 09:03.198
Wait... but if it's an
aunt, would she be a cousin?

09:03.273 --> 09:05.519
You know what? Let me work backwards.

09:05.590 --> 09:06.888
Okay, so...

09:09.749 --> 09:10.808
I'm hungry.

09:10.808 --> 09:12.244
It won't be much longer.

09:12.244 --> 09:13.338
I think I'm really starting to pick up

09:13.338 --> 09:14.971
on the intricacies of the machine.

09:14.971 --> 09:17.074
You're not good at this.

09:17.135 --> 09:18.389
I'm getting food.

09:20.831 --> 09:26.149
Okay, so, if my niece is Lucy
and Lucy's mother is Janet...

09:26.238 --> 09:27.179
wait. Hold on.

09:27.262 --> 09:28.998
So, Axl, you a big Colts fan?

09:29.055 --> 09:30.893
Nope. Not at all. Not in any way.

09:30.968 --> 09:33.232
Well, it might be a good
year to jump on the bandwagon.

09:33.326 --> 09:34.970
If luck stays healthy, they
can win the whole thing.

09:35.025 --> 09:37.281
If the offensive line does their job,

09:37.375 --> 09:38.469
luck will stay healthy.

09:38.530 --> 09:40.399
Yeah, but Pagano's got to do his job, too.

09:40.522 --> 09:42.766
If he gets too pass-happy,
they'll get blitzed every time.

09:42.854 --> 09:43.967
You can't put that on the o-line.

09:43.967 --> 09:46.193
Well, if the Colts do
win the super bowl this year,

09:46.281 --> 09:47.578
it won't be because of luck.

09:47.644 --> 09:50.687
But, then again, it will be 'cause
the quarterback's name is luck.

09:50.998 --> 09:52.181
Get it?

09:52.283 --> 09:53.847
I get it, Darrin.

09:53.924 --> 09:56.334
That's funny, huh?

09:56.420 --> 09:57.745
Yeah.

09:57.849 --> 09:59.876
So, Devin, you think
the defense will hold up?

09:59.942 --> 10:01.092
Okay, that's enough sports talk.

10:01.180 --> 10:03.037
Let's change the subject, hmm?

10:03.037 --> 10:06.111
Does anyone have a funny
air-conditioning-school story?

10:06.223 --> 10:08.264
Oh, wait... I do.

10:08.376 --> 10:10.811
This guy, Dan, at work
was on a service call,

10:10.891 --> 10:12.573
and he got his arm stuck in a fan belt.

10:16.020 --> 10:17.445
And then what happened, Darrin?

10:17.525 --> 10:19.533
Uh, I think that was the whole story.

10:19.623 --> 10:22.286
Oh, no. That can't be the whole story.

10:22.368 --> 10:23.523
There must be more.

10:23.606 --> 10:24.783
Oh, yeah. There is.

10:24.893 --> 10:26.281
He mangled his hand pretty bad

10:26.266 --> 10:28.103
and lost his pinkie finger
and half his pointer.

10:28.191 --> 10:29.987
Oh, Darrin, stop.

10:30.104 --> 10:31.293
No, seriously... stop.

10:33.342 --> 10:34.907
I can't believe you.

10:34.990 --> 10:37.329
I know, right? I'm gonna
crush my mac-and-cheese record.

10:37.370 --> 10:39.416
You're goin' down, you hear me? In my face!

10:39.510 --> 10:41.566
I'm talking about the way
you're treating Devin Levin.

10:41.654 --> 10:43.700
Oh, my God. I did everything you asked.

10:43.785 --> 10:45.943
Responsibility over. What
more do you want from me?

10:46.028 --> 10:47.279
I want you to talk to her.

10:47.351 --> 10:48.462
She doesn't seem that hard to talk to.

10:48.533 --> 10:50.423
What is it with old people

10:50.519 --> 10:51.668
thinking all young people
should talk to each other?

10:51.668 --> 10:53.074
Why don't you go talk
to the guy on the Rascal?

10:53.152 --> 10:55.313
I did. His name is Wayne.
He's from Lafayette.

10:55.381 --> 10:57.564
He has a touch of the gout,
but today is his cheat day,

10:57.649 --> 10:59.169
and tomorrow, he's going
right back on his diet.

11:00.038 --> 11:02.745
All right, come on, Axl.
Just be nice. Make an effort.

11:02.827 --> 11:04.507
I mean, you're my social one.

11:04.597 --> 11:06.806
Besides, how hard can it
be? She likes football.

11:06.910 --> 11:10.002
And not to mention, she's adorable.

11:10.121 --> 11:12.567
Ohhh. Okay.

11:12.652 --> 11:13.958
I see what's happening here.

11:14.070 --> 11:15.187
Let me just say this.

11:15.284 --> 11:19.928
I will never, ever, ever be
with someone you set me up with.

11:20.022 --> 11:22.194
- Axl...
- Ever!

11:23.913 --> 11:24.961
Ahhhh.

11:25.079 --> 11:27.024
Can you give me 20 bucks?

11:27.128 --> 11:28.180
No.

11:28.294 --> 11:29.446
How about a 5-spot?

11:29.526 --> 11:30.689
How about a no-spot?

11:30.767 --> 11:33.054
But I'm trying to win Cindy a flounder.

11:33.161 --> 11:35.015
You're the one that
told me to be chivalrous.

11:35.070 --> 11:37.132
Well, I'm not giving you any money, Brick.

11:37.207 --> 11:39.430
When we leave, you can lay
your coat over a puddle.

11:39.521 --> 11:41.315
Mm. Fair enough.

11:41.395 --> 11:42.611
I'll use my birthday money.

11:52.466 --> 11:53.848
How's your cheese?

12:01.685 --> 12:03.118
I've had better.

12:08.394 --> 12:10.256
Oh, excuse me, uh, Barry.

12:10.123 --> 12:11.538
Can you let them know we need more turkey?

12:11.635 --> 12:13.190
Sorry. We're all out of turkey.

12:15.484 --> 12:17.058
Tough break.

12:24.278 --> 12:25.255
Aw.

12:25.348 --> 12:27.873
You know, if you put the sugar packet
a little further back on the spoon,

12:27.897 --> 12:29.043
you'll get a better angle.

12:29.153 --> 12:31.062
Don't tell me how to
play sugar-packet spoon.

12:31.133 --> 12:32.555
I've been playing this
game since I realized

12:32.555 --> 12:34.548
I didn't want to talk to
my parents at restaurants.

12:34.652 --> 12:35.969
I'm just saying,

12:36.057 --> 12:37.818
if you put it a little
further back on the handle,

12:37.684 --> 12:39.517
get the sugar evenly distributed,

12:39.586 --> 12:42.251
you can pop it in, just like...

12:43.767 --> 12:44.921
That.

12:45.044 --> 12:46.046
Hmm.

12:46.838 --> 12:48.491
Are you done eating already?

12:48.557 --> 12:51.023
You haven't even gotten your $7 worth.

12:51.023 --> 12:52.620
Well, I didn't want to be done eating,

12:52.658 --> 12:53.654
but they ran out of turkey.

12:54.368 --> 12:56.638
You know, in my day, I'd have made sure

12:56.691 --> 12:59.147
that my girlfriend's dad got
his turkey before I got mine.

12:59.224 --> 13:01.144
Oh. I'm sorry, Mr. Heck. Here. Take mine.

13:01.219 --> 13:03.423
- No, thanks.
- No, seriously. I'm not even hungry.

13:03.528 --> 13:04.804
I'm just eating 'cause I'm bored.

13:04.892 --> 13:06.503
Just take it, dad. He wants you to have it.

13:06.421 --> 13:07.331
I said I don't want it.

13:07.429 --> 13:08.884
Is it because it has ranch dressing on it?

13:08.947 --> 13:10.207
'Cause I can wipe it off.

13:10.268 --> 13:11.773
Uggh. Darrin...

13:13.933 --> 13:15.810
Here. Just like new.

13:15.943 --> 13:16.859
Forget it, Darrin.

13:19.021 --> 13:21.075
Why'd I take the last piece of turkey?

13:21.169 --> 13:22.237
I'm such an idiot.

13:22.303 --> 13:24.166
I know this is gonna sound crazy,

13:24.166 --> 13:25.358
but when I'm with your dad,

13:25.419 --> 13:27.773
I get this weird vibe he doesn't like me.

13:27.875 --> 13:29.198
What?!

13:29.311 --> 13:30.944
That's nuts!

13:31.013 --> 13:33.076
You're, like, my dad's favorite

13:33.162 --> 13:35.151
and so on and so forth and what have you.

13:35.762 --> 13:36.665
I don't know.

13:36.764 --> 13:38.961
I feel like I'm lagging
behind Cindy and Devin Levin.

13:39.063 --> 13:41.701
No, no, no. He loves
you. Everything's fine.

13:41.792 --> 13:42.755
The important thing

13:42.821 --> 13:44.872
is to not beat yourself
up about it and act weird.

13:44.961 --> 13:46.740
Just act normal.

13:46.851 --> 13:48.782
W-well, but a little bit better.

13:48.862 --> 13:50.679
Well, better than you were
at being better before,

13:50.656 --> 13:52.107
but not so much better that it's weird.

13:52.176 --> 13:54.306
The important thing is to not overthink it.

13:58.374 --> 14:00.221
Boom! It's on!

14:00.292 --> 14:01.865
All right, first one to 21 wins.

14:01.942 --> 14:03.415
Loser drinks Darrin's turkey water.

14:05.582 --> 14:07.743
So, did your parents say what
time they were gonna pick you up?

14:08.781 --> 14:10.637
It depends what time they
get back from Kentucky.

14:16.808 --> 14:18.105
Thanks, Delores.

14:18.225 --> 14:19.400
Keep 'em coming.

14:20.606 --> 14:22.648
All right, here we go.

14:22.648 --> 14:24.698
Papa needs a good grab.

14:27.276 --> 14:29.302
Yeah! There you go!

14:29.396 --> 14:31.124
Choke it down, my friend.

14:31.212 --> 14:33.349
And make sure you finish
all those turkey chunks.

14:33.410 --> 14:35.140
Those babies are filled with protein.

14:35.206 --> 14:36.537
Come on. There you go.

14:36.625 --> 14:38.641
Oh. Whoo!

14:39.387 --> 14:41.443
There's a reason they didn't have taquitos

14:41.526 --> 14:42.540
at the first Thanksgiving.

14:43.479 --> 14:45.470
If I can just rally a burp here,

14:45.561 --> 14:47.922
I might be able to squeeze
in a piece of zebra cake.

14:53.419 --> 14:55.025
I think I fixed everything, Sue.

14:55.116 --> 14:56.140
What did you do?

14:57.057 --> 14:59.393
I ate the turkey and your
dad didn't get any. Remember?

14:59.492 --> 15:01.470
I meant, what did you do to fix it?

15:01.586 --> 15:02.670
Oh.

15:02.786 --> 15:05.608
I told them it was your dad's
birthday, even though it's not,

15:05.679 --> 15:07.373
and they're gonna bring
over a cake and sing to him.

15:07.508 --> 15:08.430
Wait. What?

15:08.532 --> 15:10.811
We do it in our family all
the time. It's hilarious.

15:10.919 --> 15:13.672
No one can stay mad when
strangers are singing to them.

15:15.938 --> 15:18.381
Mom, I have to talk to you.
Darrin did something bad.

15:18.461 --> 15:20.375
Don't worry. Dad will
get over the turkey thing.

15:20.456 --> 15:22.313
He told the waiters to sing
"Happy Birthday" to dad.

15:22.441 --> 15:23.834
What?

15:23.958 --> 15:25.785
Has he lost his mind?!

15:25.848 --> 15:26.954
I don't know.

15:27.973 --> 15:29.418
Listen to me right now.

15:29.418 --> 15:32.085
You need to tell me who you talked
to and exactly what you said.

15:32.197 --> 15:33.777
Uh, I don't know. He was a waiter.

15:33.843 --> 15:34.694
What did he look like?

15:34.740 --> 15:35.953
He had an apron and a pen.

15:36.028 --> 15:38.277
They all have aprons
and pens! I need details.

15:38.345 --> 15:40.205
Mole on his face, crooked nose... anything.

15:40.271 --> 15:41.034
I don't remember.

15:41.117 --> 15:42.676
Well, you've got to remember!

15:42.761 --> 15:44.810
It's kind of hard to think
when you're yelling at me!

15:44.873 --> 15:46.949
All right, just... just
go and find him... now!

15:47.037 --> 15:48.533
Axl!

15:48.627 --> 15:50.720
Darrin told the waiters to
sing "Happy Birthday" to dad.

15:50.786 --> 15:52.401
Oh, my God. He's killed us all!

15:52.504 --> 15:54.078
All right, listen, we got to stop this!

15:54.147 --> 15:55.211
Everybody, fan out.

15:55.269 --> 15:57.162
Axl, you check the kitchen.
Sue, you talk to the hostess.

15:57.245 --> 15:58.638
You see anybody carrying a birthday cake,

15:58.695 --> 15:59.469
you take them out!

16:04.991 --> 16:07.214
Hey. Wrong table. Keep moving.

16:07.272 --> 16:10.137
Citizen of King's Feast,
by decree of the King,

16:10.192 --> 16:11.810
I declare it to be the day of birth

16:11.865 --> 16:13.958
of noble townsman Mike Heck.

16:14.038 --> 16:15.081
It's not my B...

16:15.155 --> 16:17.760
♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪

16:17.848 --> 16:20.948
♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪

16:21.040 --> 16:24.971
♪ Happy Birthday,
dear Mi-I-ke ♪

16:24.971 --> 16:28.263
♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪

16:29.066 --> 16:31.340
♪ You take a big breath and blow ♪

16:35.638 --> 16:37.008
Who?

16:44.085 --> 16:46.401
I don't get it. Does
your dad not like cake?

16:46.472 --> 16:47.684
No, Darrin, he does not like cake,

16:47.750 --> 16:48.738
he does not like being embarrassed,

16:48.821 --> 16:50.384
and he does not like you!

16:51.807 --> 16:53.102
Your dad doesn't like me?

16:53.308 --> 16:55.260
No... Darrin.

16:55.538 --> 16:57.414
B-but he should.

16:57.488 --> 16:59.721
Dad, I know Darrin isn't perfect,

16:59.793 --> 17:02.620
but Cindy ate a whole wedge of cheese,

17:02.697 --> 17:04.781
and Brick spent the whole
dinner playing an arcade game,

17:04.896 --> 17:05.992
and Axl's being rude

17:06.067 --> 17:07.976
to mom's hair person's
cousin's niece's daughter.

17:08.007 --> 17:09.156
And none of this would've happened

17:09.237 --> 17:11.115
if we could've just had
Thanksgiving at home,

17:10.954 --> 17:12.347
like God intended it to be!

17:13.377 --> 17:15.719
You know what? Home sounds
like a good idea right now.

17:15.813 --> 17:17.048
My God, Sue.

17:16.944 --> 17:18.459
Thanks to you, now we got to go home,

17:18.547 --> 17:20.084
and I haven't even had a chance

17:20.124 --> 17:21.310
to make my mex-Italian meat sundae!

17:21.357 --> 17:23.122
- You are so rude, Axl!
- You just try so hard!

17:23.204 --> 17:25.092
- She's really, really cute!
- Be at home, eating turkey!

17:25.161 --> 17:26.146
Stop it!

17:26.226 --> 17:27.762
It's Thanksgiving!

17:27.875 --> 17:30.924
Thanksgiving... the one day of the year

17:30.996 --> 17:33.686
we're supposed to stop
complaining and stressing out

17:33.788 --> 17:35.818
and just give thanks!

17:36.683 --> 17:38.921
I mean, we have so much to be thankful for.

17:39.012 --> 17:41.398
We're all here together and we're healthy

17:41.486 --> 17:43.672
and we're... relatively happy.

17:43.780 --> 17:46.152
You know, there are people
that live in the street

17:46.285 --> 17:47.286
and have nothing to eat,

17:47.352 --> 17:49.947
and here we are with this bountiful feast

17:50.032 --> 17:53.464
of lo mein and moussaka
and root-beer cake,

17:53.506 --> 17:56.794
and we're inside, where
it's warm and nice and...

17:58.340 --> 18:00.167
Folks, this is not a drill.

18:00.264 --> 18:03.272
We need everyone to evacuate
the building immediately.

18:05.671 --> 18:08.102
Game over, pink flounder.

18:08.209 --> 18:11.376
At long last, you are mine.

18:17.493 --> 18:21.008
Sorry, folks. We had a
small electrical fire.

18:21.108 --> 18:23.358
As soon as the fire department clears us,

18:23.430 --> 18:24.991
we'll get you all back inside.

18:25.107 --> 18:26.489
Sorry.

18:26.577 --> 18:28.972
I spent all my money, but I
couldn't get you your flounder.

18:29.991 --> 18:31.009
My what?

18:31.872 --> 18:34.437
- Mr. Heck, sir...
- Darrin, listen.

18:34.514 --> 18:35.970
I don't dislike you.

18:36.133 --> 18:39.031
All in all, you're a pretty good guy.

18:39.097 --> 18:40.867
I'm just not gonna like anyone...

18:40.939 --> 18:43.708
anyone who's looking to
take away my daughter.

18:44.006 --> 18:45.433
It makes me grumpy.

18:45.667 --> 18:47.430
You can understand that, right?

18:47.507 --> 18:48.849
Yes, sir.

18:48.951 --> 18:50.412
But I'll try to be better anyway.

18:50.514 --> 18:52.089
Good plan.

18:52.185 --> 18:53.812
You seen my wife?

18:58.829 --> 19:01.671
I guess I was feeling sorry for myself.

19:01.756 --> 19:04.167
For the first time in
my life, I was thinking

19:04.235 --> 19:07.003
maybe I didn't have
anything to be thankful for.

19:07.085 --> 19:09.411
The last few months with two jobs,

19:09.519 --> 19:12.042
no dining-room table, a floor sink,

19:12.141 --> 19:13.779
having Thanksgiving in a restaurant,

19:13.779 --> 19:15.071
like a bunch of losers...

19:15.166 --> 19:18.631
it all just washed over me, and I was done.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.896
Done trying to make everything fine for...

19:22.373 --> 19:23.248
are you kidding me?

19:25.852 --> 19:27.296
You are...

19:27.385 --> 19:28.944
You are so gonna get it.

19:28.944 --> 19:30.549
Watch out. Here it comes.

19:30.623 --> 19:32.674
Whoo! Yeah, babe!

19:34.249 --> 19:35.873
Hey! No fair.

19:35.873 --> 19:37.241
Who's that?

19:47.209 --> 19:49.056
Hey, turkey water!

19:51.538 --> 19:52.997
Pfft! Weak!

19:53.039 --> 19:54.503
Ohhh!

19:57.666 --> 19:58.827
I... I'm it!

19:58.827 --> 19:59.894
And just like that,

19:59.988 --> 20:02.209
the Thanksgiving we
never wanted to remember

20:02.292 --> 20:03.983
turned into one we'd never forget.

20:23.458 --> 20:24.489
Thanks for the ride.

20:24.572 --> 20:26.054
My pleasure.

20:26.146 --> 20:29.125
And, uh, just so you know,
I don't have a girlfriend.

20:29.208 --> 20:30.950
You don't?

20:31.043 --> 20:33.107
Well, I did.

20:33.194 --> 20:34.406
But, uh... She...

20:34.539 --> 20:36.807
Died.

20:37.624 --> 20:39.307
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:39.378 --> 20:40.925
Got the text during dinner, so...

20:41.468 --> 20:43.611
Wow. So sudden.

20:43.723 --> 20:46.023
Mm. Well, not really.

20:46.089 --> 20:47.153
She was in a coma.

20:47.219 --> 20:49.081
Truth is, we weren't really that close.

20:49.161 --> 20:50.978
You weren't really that
close to your girlfriend?

20:51.074 --> 20:52.131
D... I mean, eh...

20:52.225 --> 20:54.600
We both knew before the
coma it wasn't working out.

20:54.600 --> 20:57.036
Um, her last words to me were, uh,

20:57.091 --> 21:00.178
"Move on. Be happy. Find someone else."

21:00.252 --> 21:02.660
We didn't know at the time
those were her last words,

21:02.748 --> 21:05.710
but, uh, still
pretty poetic.

21:06.617 --> 21:08.315
- Wow.
- Yeah.

21:16.092 --> 21:17.897
- Good luck with that.
- Thank you.

21:21.224 --> 21:23.222
Happy thanksgiv...
