Gary: Gramps wants me to track
down the Old Midnight Society,

00:32.073 --> 00:34.577
get their clues, find The
Silver Sight and destroy it

00:34.577 --> 00:36.161
once and for all...

00:36.161 --> 00:37.956
like they should
have done years ago.

00:37.956 --> 00:39.791
Tell us about the
Silver Sight thing again?

00:39.791 --> 00:41.960
It's a charm,
probably a small thing,

00:41.960 --> 00:44.963
but it's has some kind of power
that can really hurt people.

00:44.963 --> 00:46.798
Oh man I'm not liking this.

00:46.798 --> 00:48.591
Your gramps was a
good guy, right?

00:48.591 --> 00:50.426
The best.

00:50.426 --> 00:53.763
I gotta find out why he died.

00:55.681 --> 00:58.142
Okay, give me a name quick.
Before I change my mind.

00:58.142 --> 00:59.936
Alright.
Thanks Meg.

00:59.936 --> 01:02.605
Why don't we just find
the guy that hid it

01:02.605 --> 01:04.272
in the first place?

01:04.272 --> 01:06.275
He died the day after he hid it.

01:06.275 --> 01:09.361
Oh man, this just
keeps getting better.

01:09.361 --> 01:11.447
I'll help.

01:11.447 --> 01:12.991
Me too...

01:12.991 --> 01:15.200
but, not by myself.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.745
No problem, how 'bout the
two of you work together.

01:17.745 --> 01:19.455
Alright?

01:19.455 --> 01:22.207
Don't you think this is a
little bit out of bounds.

01:22.207 --> 01:23.459
It's alright Quinn.

01:23.459 --> 01:26.045
You don't have to help man.

01:29.381 --> 01:31.342
You know I'll help.

01:31.342 --> 01:35.429
Cuz if this thing gets
nasty, you're gonna need me.

01:35.429 --> 01:37.097
Great.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.767
Alright, Tuck and I'll
take care of the fourth name.

01:39.767 --> 01:42.227
Remember, it's the pieces
of the record that we need.

01:42.227 --> 01:44.104
That's where the clues are.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.524
We'll meet tomorrow in my dorm
room for a status report, ok?

01:46.524 --> 01:50.611
Alright!
Let's hit it!

02:06.544 --> 02:09.295
No chance this is right.

02:12.216 --> 02:14.593
Waste of time.

02:15.803 --> 02:16.553
Yo!

02:17.930 --> 02:20.016
Anybody here?

02:20.016 --> 02:21.141
I'm looking for...

02:21.141 --> 02:22.935
[dog barking]

02:22.935 --> 02:23.775
Oh man.

02:30.943 --> 02:32.277
If you wanna bite me...

02:32.277 --> 02:35.740
you're gonna have to catch me!

02:40.786 --> 02:42.788
Help me!

02:42.788 --> 02:43.873
Help!

02:43.873 --> 02:46.333
Somebody help!
Get the dog!!!

02:46.333 --> 02:47.334
Somebody!

02:47.334 --> 02:49.962
Mister! Help!
Get the dog!

02:49.962 --> 02:52.506
What's your problem?

02:52.506 --> 02:57.095
Whatever it was, it's gone now.

02:57.095 --> 03:00.139
How come you don't have a
"Beware of Dog" sign out front?

03:00.139 --> 03:03.059
Cuz I ain't got no dog.

03:22.244 --> 03:24.038
220...

03:24.038 --> 03:24.758
222...

03:26.165 --> 03:27.165
220.

03:28.793 --> 03:31.336
Where's 224?

03:52.483 --> 03:53.203
Hello?

03:57.113 --> 03:58.572
HEY!

03:58.572 --> 03:59.822
WAIT!

04:02.952 --> 04:06.164
Boy:
I know where she went.

04:06.164 --> 04:07.289
Where did you come from?

04:07.289 --> 04:09.291
Boy:
Good question.

04:09.291 --> 04:10.793
You look lost.

04:10.793 --> 04:14.505
Actually I'm looking
for 224 Walker Court,

04:14.505 --> 04:15.840
it's not here anymore.

04:15.840 --> 04:17.591
Sure it is.

04:17.591 --> 04:20.178
He-llo?? You're standing
right on it, nothing there.

04:20.178 --> 04:23.597
No, YOU'RE standing on it.

04:26.558 --> 04:28.352
She's down there.

04:28.352 --> 04:30.312
Yeah, sure.

04:30.312 --> 04:32.481
I know what you're looking for.

04:32.481 --> 04:33.941
Really?

04:33.941 --> 04:35.109
What?

04:35.109 --> 04:36.568
The Silver Sight.

04:36.568 --> 04:40.531
If you want it, follow me.

04:46.204 --> 04:49.748
No way! Forget it!

04:52.584 --> 04:56.047
I can't believe I'm doing this!

05:07.141 --> 05:08.726
Yo, Bud.

05:08.726 --> 05:10.102
I'm looking for somebody.

05:10.102 --> 05:13.355
Here? Ha ha! Good luck.

05:13.355 --> 05:15.482
This is 33 Carroll
street, right?

05:15.482 --> 05:18.652
Kid, I got any piece of junk
that's been made in the last

05:18.652 --> 05:21.739
fifty years, but I'm
fresh out of people.

05:21.739 --> 05:23.074
Now git!

05:23.074 --> 05:26.869
Her name's Donna Tilton.

05:28.704 --> 05:30.873
Why're you looking for her?

05:30.873 --> 05:32.750
Uh... see I'm part of this club

05:32.750 --> 05:35.294
and we're looking for
all the old members.

05:35.294 --> 05:36.879
It's cool, really.

05:36.879 --> 05:39.090
I'm not trying to
make any trouble.

05:39.090 --> 05:43.302
You talking about that Midnight
Society something-or-other?

05:43.302 --> 05:44.887
Yeah!
That's it!

05:44.887 --> 05:48.432
Unless that's a bad
thing, then I'm not.

05:50.059 --> 05:50.779
C'mon.

05:59.568 --> 06:02.780
This is disgusting.

06:06.784 --> 06:09.578
I'm here kid!

06:09.578 --> 06:12.790
Kid?
[creepy laughter]

06:21.173 --> 06:21.893
Hello?

06:23.968 --> 06:25.510
Hey wait!

06:25.510 --> 06:28.513
Don't run!
It's alright!

06:30.099 --> 06:33.185
Please stop, okay?

06:33.185 --> 06:35.604
I wore my best outfit
cuz I thought I'd be

06:35.604 --> 06:37.315
visiting some
really nice house!

06:37.315 --> 06:40.818
I didn't plan on
being in some really,

06:40.818 --> 06:43.487
strange house.

07:06.510 --> 07:10.555
When did I step
through the looking glass?

07:12.683 --> 07:15.269
Step into my office.

07:15.269 --> 07:17.855
Sorry 'bout the mess...

07:17.855 --> 07:21.025
secretary's day off.

07:24.569 --> 07:26.113
So uh...

07:26.113 --> 07:28.657
How'd you get this address?

07:28.657 --> 07:30.909
I, talked to people, you know.

07:30.909 --> 07:33.871
Smart kid, huh?

07:33.871 --> 07:35.122
Depends.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.081
On what?

07:36.081 --> 07:38.000
On if you know Donna Tilton.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.460
I know her alright.

07:40.460 --> 07:45.049
Back in high school, Donna
and I were the golden couple...

07:45.049 --> 07:50.262
homecoming king,
queen, the works.

07:50.262 --> 07:53.515
She was a beaut.

07:53.515 --> 07:56.560
Never seen anyone
since even came close.

07:56.560 --> 07:59.771
So did you marry
her or something?

07:59.771 --> 08:01.648
Nope.

08:01.648 --> 08:05.444
Ran into the worst string
of bad luck you ever saw.

08:05.444 --> 08:07.279
I was a star athlete...

08:07.279 --> 08:09.156
broke my leg.

08:09.156 --> 08:13.911
Got in a car accident,
nearly bought the farm.

08:13.911 --> 08:16.163
Then a fire hit our house.

08:16.163 --> 08:20.792
Family got out but, I
ended up in the hospital.

08:20.792 --> 08:25.630
It was as if this dark cloud of
bad luck settled in over me and,

08:25.630 --> 08:28.550
decided to stay.

08:28.550 --> 08:29.927
That's pretty tough.

08:29.927 --> 08:30.767
Yeah...

08:32.471 --> 08:35.599
but the worst was still to come.

08:44.608 --> 08:47.236
What have we here?

08:49.280 --> 08:51.990
Were you announced?

08:55.827 --> 08:57.413
Whoo!
Five miles.

08:57.413 --> 08:59.539
I beat the
eleven-o-two out of...

08:59.539 --> 09:02.418
Whoa, who is this?

09:02.418 --> 09:06.880
We don't know dear.
She hasn't told us yet.

09:06.880 --> 09:10.384
Peggy dear, did you leave
the manhole open again?

09:10.384 --> 09:13.137
No matter, she's here now.

09:13.137 --> 09:15.973
We were just about to
have some refreshments.

09:15.973 --> 09:17.724
Would you care to join us?

09:17.724 --> 09:19.810
Please.

09:23.188 --> 09:25.023
While I was in the hospital,

09:25.023 --> 09:27.818
Donna started seeing
another guy.

09:27.818 --> 09:29.361
No way!

09:29.361 --> 09:31.196
While you were sick?

09:31.196 --> 09:33.532
Well I can't say I blame her.

09:33.532 --> 09:36.618
I mean nothing was
going right for me.

09:36.618 --> 09:38.578
Still, that's
pretty cold.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.080
See that's...

09:40.080 --> 09:42.249
That's her.

09:42.249 --> 09:45.336
Pretty as can be.

09:45.336 --> 09:48.755
I was going to try
and get her back,

09:48.755 --> 09:55.095
but before I got out, she went
driving with her new boyfriend.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.888
There was an accident...

09:56.888 --> 09:58.849
only one of 'em made it.

09:58.849 --> 10:02.561
Please tell me it was Donna.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.493
Tragic, huh?

10:20.496 --> 10:25.042
This is gonna sound
nuts, but I gotta tell you,

10:25.042 --> 10:29.796
it almost felt like there
was some kind of force at work

10:29.796 --> 10:33.592
trying to keep us apart.

10:42.393 --> 10:46.146
Sorry to bring up
bad memories man.

10:47.439 --> 10:49.649
Where you going?

10:49.649 --> 10:53.320
I gotta go tell my
friends that Donna's gone.

10:53.778 --> 10:55.028
Wait!

10:58.909 --> 11:02.538
You haven't heard
the whole story.

11:02.538 --> 11:03.705
I don't need to, I gotta...

11:03.705 --> 11:07.543
[clanking]
What's that?

11:10.087 --> 11:12.130
LOOK OUT!

11:22.057 --> 11:23.475
Ouch.

11:23.475 --> 11:25.227
I know what this is!

11:25.227 --> 11:27.062
It's coming after me again!

11:27.062 --> 11:28.272
What is?

11:28.272 --> 11:30.941
The Silver Sight!
It's back!

11:30.941 --> 11:33.318
LEAVE ME ALONE!

11:33.318 --> 11:37.281
YOU RUINED MY LIFE
WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?

11:37.281 --> 11:39.324
You know about The Silver Sight?

11:39.324 --> 11:40.867
That's what I'm looking for!

11:40.867 --> 11:42.286
Don't!

11:42.286 --> 11:44.413
Don't even go near it.

11:44.413 --> 11:49.585
I'm telling ya pal, every
bit of bad luck I had was

11:49.585 --> 11:51.587
because of that monster!

11:51.587 --> 11:53.964
Leave it alone!

11:53.964 --> 11:57.801
Did Donna ever tell
you about a record?

11:57.801 --> 12:01.930
I mean, a piece of a
record that somebody gave her?

12:01.930 --> 12:04.975
It's real important man.

12:10.355 --> 12:11.440
That's it!

12:11.440 --> 12:13.066
That's the record!

12:13.066 --> 12:14.610
Oh no.

12:14.610 --> 12:17.321
It's the only thing I
got left of Donna's.

12:17.321 --> 12:18.905
But I gotta have it!

12:18.905 --> 12:20.324
What for?

12:20.324 --> 12:21.533
Cuz we're trying to
find this Silver Sight

12:21.533 --> 12:22.867
thing and destroy it!

12:22.867 --> 12:24.536
If it's still hurting
people, I mean,

12:24.536 --> 12:26.997
maybe you ought to help me out!

12:26.997 --> 12:28.707
I'll make you a deal.

12:28.707 --> 12:32.544
You do something for me,
and I'll give this to you.

12:32.544 --> 12:34.838
No sweat.
What do you want?

12:34.838 --> 12:38.467
When I was in the hospital,
I drew a picture of Donna.

12:38.467 --> 12:39.926
You want me to get the picture?

12:39.926 --> 12:41.803
Fine.
Where is it?

12:41.803 --> 12:46.558
It was stolen from me by the
same guy who stole Donna...

12:46.558 --> 12:49.687
Laing Candle.

12:49.687 --> 12:52.063
Laing Candle?
He was in The Midnight Society!

12:52.063 --> 12:53.148
Yeah.

12:53.148 --> 12:56.067
Get me back that drawing.

12:56.067 --> 13:00.280
I'll give you the record.

13:00.280 --> 13:04.159
Eleanor Gregory was my
mother, she passed on years ago.

13:04.159 --> 13:04.909
Oh.

13:05.703 --> 13:07.954
Oh no that's okay,
that's ancient news.

13:07.954 --> 13:11.375
I don't mean to be rude,
but don't you find it odd...

13:11.375 --> 13:13.918
That we live down here?

13:13.918 --> 13:17.464
It is a bit dank,
but we have no choice.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.550
Mother made a fortune
in the stock market

13:19.550 --> 13:20.884
before she was twenty.

13:20.884 --> 13:23.803
We always had the
finest of everything...

13:23.803 --> 13:26.724
until it all went sour.

13:26.724 --> 13:29.560
Wondeful tea, dear.

13:29.560 --> 13:31.144
So what happened?

13:31.144 --> 13:33.021
Suddenly every decision
Mother made was the wrong one.

13:33.021 --> 13:35.649
It's as if she were cursed.

13:35.649 --> 13:38.485
Eventually her empire crumbled.

13:38.485 --> 13:43.198
What you see here is
all that we have left.

13:43.198 --> 13:45.659
You're very pretty.

13:45.659 --> 13:47.494
Why are you down here?

13:47.494 --> 13:50.288
Well you can't make a fortune
without also making some enemies

13:50.288 --> 13:52.123
along the way.

13:52.123 --> 13:54.084
They took everything they could.

13:54.084 --> 13:58.463
Our clothes, most of our cars,
the mansion that used to stand

13:58.463 --> 14:00.257
right above us...

14:00.257 --> 14:04.595
if we didn't hide down here they
would have taken everything.

14:04.595 --> 14:08.848
But we'll be back, oh yes.

14:08.848 --> 14:12.477
The Gregory empire will rise
from the ashes and we'll be back

14:12.477 --> 14:14.020
on top again!

14:14.020 --> 14:15.272
Ha ha ha ha!

14:15.272 --> 14:16.272
How?

14:19.443 --> 14:23.071
I don't know.

14:23.071 --> 14:25.990
I'm working on it.

14:25.990 --> 14:28.535
Why are you so
interested in Mother Eleanor?

14:28.535 --> 14:30.912
My friends and I are
looking for this charm

14:30.912 --> 14:33.624
called The Silver Sight...

14:37.335 --> 14:38.055
Uh oh.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.339
Please dear, don't...

14:41.339 --> 14:43.383
Get out!

14:43.383 --> 14:44.802
What'd I say?

14:44.802 --> 14:46.637
That thing is what
caused mother's ruin!

14:46.637 --> 14:48.847
If it wasn't for that horrid
charm we wouldn't have

14:48.847 --> 14:50.682
to live down here like rats!
-But...

14:50.682 --> 14:52.225
What do you want it for?
Hmmm?

14:52.225 --> 14:53.602
To use it's vile magic?

14:53.602 --> 14:55.813
My mother did and
look where it got us!

14:55.813 --> 14:57.272
No, but we're gonna destroy it!

14:57.272 --> 14:58.774
Ha ha...

14:58.774 --> 15:01.443
You can't destroy it,
it can only destroy you!

15:01.443 --> 15:04.613
Now get out!

15:05.739 --> 15:07.282
Finish your tea dear.

15:07.282 --> 15:09.451
Thank you sweetie.

15:22.339 --> 15:24.132
Wait!

15:24.132 --> 15:25.467
Back off buddy!

15:25.467 --> 15:27.719
It's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

15:27.719 --> 15:29.554
We're not as
weird as you think.

15:29.554 --> 15:30.972
at least I'm not.

15:30.972 --> 15:32.265
That's nice, I'm glad, goodbye.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.058
Wait!

15:34.058 --> 15:38.062
You're looking for that broken
piece of the record, right?

15:38.062 --> 15:39.230
Well yeah.

15:39.230 --> 15:41.107
I can get it for you.

15:41.107 --> 15:44.277
But you have to come back later,
once my father's calmed down.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.779
Why would you help me?

15:45.779 --> 15:47.989
You think I like
living in the sewer?

15:47.989 --> 15:50.325
If destroying the Silver
Sight gets us outta here,

15:50.325 --> 15:53.912
I'll do whatever it takes.

15:53.912 --> 15:58.583
I wouldn't mind
seeing the sun again.

15:58.583 --> 16:01.419
Okay, I'll be
back in a few hours.

16:01.419 --> 16:05.549
Mother:
Jim! Supper time!

16:08.301 --> 16:11.805
Whoa, you stink.

16:11.805 --> 16:13.097
Sorry.

16:13.097 --> 16:14.140
Hey check this out.

16:14.140 --> 16:17.728
Midnight Society...
1937.

16:19.229 --> 16:20.229
Wow!

16:25.861 --> 16:27.445
So how'd you guys do?

16:27.445 --> 16:29.072
Not good.

16:29.072 --> 16:31.115
We've been to the
library, we've been on-line,

16:31.115 --> 16:34.619
we've called everywhere but, we
can't seem to find any record of

16:34.619 --> 16:36.079
Bruce McGorrill.

16:36.079 --> 16:37.581
Well there's gotta be
some trace somewhere.

16:37.581 --> 16:38.707
Keep looking alright.

16:38.707 --> 16:41.167
[telephone rings]

16:41.167 --> 16:43.086
Hello?

16:43.086 --> 16:44.295
Grandma??

16:44.295 --> 16:46.256
HELLO??

16:46.256 --> 16:47.424
Hello??

16:47.424 --> 16:48.425
What?

16:48.425 --> 16:50.260
C'MON!

16:51.219 --> 16:53.263
Easy!

16:53.263 --> 16:55.139
Why are they...

16:55.139 --> 16:57.434
whoa, what's with the smell?

16:57.434 --> 16:58.977
Megan's been in the sewer.

16:58.977 --> 17:01.897
Nah, smells more
like bad perfume.

17:01.897 --> 17:02.981
That's it.

17:02.981 --> 17:04.398
If anyone wants me I'll be

17:04.398 --> 17:08.278
hangin' with the
stinky mole people.

17:09.570 --> 17:10.571
Hey, what's this?

17:10.571 --> 17:12.156
The original Midnight Society.

17:12.156 --> 17:13.742
Which one's Donna Tilton?

17:13.742 --> 17:16.035
I think that's her.

17:16.035 --> 17:21.249
Excellent!
I can use this!

17:21.249 --> 17:22.960
We have the worst
assigment you know.

17:22.960 --> 17:24.419
Lemme try.

17:24.419 --> 17:27.756
A guy can't just
vanish without a trace.

17:43.772 --> 17:44.492
Hello?

17:45.899 --> 17:46.942
Hello Quinn.

17:46.942 --> 17:48.234
Uhh, hey.

17:48.234 --> 17:50.236
My name's...

17:50.236 --> 17:52.280
wait, how do you know my name?

17:52.280 --> 17:53.907
I know a lot of things.

17:53.907 --> 17:55.450
Looking for a picture?

17:55.450 --> 17:56.952
Well, yeah.

17:56.952 --> 17:57.672
C'mon.

18:04.125 --> 18:08.254
Hey yo, weird little kid?!

18:11.174 --> 18:15.470
[door closes]
'Cmon, stop messin' around!

18:22.727 --> 18:23.895
Hey!

18:23.895 --> 18:25.188
Both:
What're you doing here?

18:25.188 --> 18:26.564
Both:
I'm looking for...

18:26.564 --> 18:28.650
Both:
But you're supposed to...

18:28.650 --> 18:31.110
I'm looking for...

18:31.110 --> 18:33.321
THAT!

18:39.494 --> 18:40.996
This is her, right?

18:40.996 --> 18:42.580
Donna Tilton?

18:42.580 --> 18:43.707
Looks like her.

18:43.707 --> 18:44.875
Excellent.

18:44.875 --> 18:46.209
Hey, you can't just take that!

18:46.209 --> 18:48.294
Yeah I can, it
doesn't belong to him.

18:48.294 --> 18:51.255
I'll tell you about it later!

18:55.093 --> 18:57.261
Man, stop doing that!

18:57.261 --> 19:01.016
If you keep going, you'll
look like that picture.

19:01.016 --> 19:02.096
Say what?

19:27.500 --> 19:31.088
[creepy laughter]

19:31.088 --> 19:32.088
Jim?

19:43.725 --> 19:44.445
Hello?

19:47.186 --> 19:49.564
Mr. Gregory?

19:50.231 --> 19:51.649
Are you...

19:51.649 --> 19:54.193
Laing Candle?

19:54.193 --> 19:55.862
General Laing Candle.

19:55.862 --> 19:56.947
Where are the Gregorys?

19:56.947 --> 19:58.031
Huh...

19:58.031 --> 19:59.741
I threatened to call the police

19:59.741 --> 20:02.077
and they scampered
off like rats.

20:02.077 --> 20:03.870
What are you looking for?

20:03.870 --> 20:05.622
The record.

20:05.622 --> 20:09.834
You want their piece of the
record! You're the traitor!

20:09.834 --> 20:12.295
How many pieces of the
record have you found?

20:12.295 --> 20:13.337
None of your business.

20:13.337 --> 20:14.714
I can MAKE you tell me.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.382
What're you gonna
do, run me over?

20:16.382 --> 20:17.342
Perhaps.

20:33.483 --> 20:36.736
Come back here!

20:43.493 --> 20:46.037
Go home girl, you hear me?

20:46.037 --> 20:50.750
Leave the Silver Sight to me!

21:10.061 --> 21:13.523
Help! Help!

21:13.523 --> 21:14.649
Peggy?

21:14.649 --> 21:15.692
Jim?

21:15.692 --> 21:19.320
Somebody, please help me!

21:24.325 --> 21:25.743
My foot is stuck!

21:25.743 --> 21:27.704
Who are you?
What're you doing down here?

21:27.704 --> 21:29.539
I'm scared!
Help me out.

21:29.539 --> 21:32.500
Your foot is stuck.
It won't budge.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.919
Pull it out, 'cmon.

21:42.260 --> 21:43.302
Uh oh!

21:43.302 --> 21:45.972
GET ME OUT!
GET ME OUT!

21:45.972 --> 21:47.390
I'm trying!

21:47.390 --> 21:49.308
Ahh!
It won't budge!

21:49.308 --> 21:50.727
Your boot is totally wedged!

21:50.727 --> 21:52.062
Take your foot out!

21:52.062 --> 21:54.313
You gotta pull!
Pull!

21:54.313 --> 21:55.606
It won't budge!

21:55.606 --> 21:56.900
Pull!
You've gotta pull!

21:56.900 --> 21:58.317
Ohh it hurts!

21:58.317 --> 21:59.819
Leave The Silver Sight alone...

21:59.819 --> 22:02.488
or you might get hurt.

22:26.971 --> 22:31.392
"Please help us. Jim."

22:33.103 --> 22:37.690
It's a race that has no winners.

22:42.653 --> 22:44.614
You be careful kid.

22:44.614 --> 22:47.200
I don't know what
that Silver Sight is,

22:47.200 --> 22:48.868
but it hurt me...

22:48.868 --> 22:52.289
it hurt Donna.

22:52.289 --> 22:56.500
Don't let it get to you too.

23:00.297 --> 23:03.883
"With many ups and downs."

23:10.265 --> 23:11.465
[growling]

23:15.186 --> 23:16.146
Help me!

23:36.958 --> 23:39.336
Ha ha ha!

23:39.336 --> 23:42.588
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha!
