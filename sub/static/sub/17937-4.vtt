WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:05.799
 Fresh from the fields
all fetor and fertile

00:05.800 --> 00:10.159
 It's bloody and raw
but I swear it is sweet

00:10.160 --> 00:15.519
 With her sweetened breath
and her tongue so mean

00:15.520 --> 00:20.239
 She's the angel
of small death and the codeine scene

00:20.240 --> 00:22.919
 With her straw-blonde hair

00:22.920 --> 00:25.319
 Her arms hard and lean

00:25.320 --> 00:29.839
 She's the angel of small death
and the codeine scene.

00:29.840 --> 00:31.639
Raar!

00:35.800 --> 00:38.559
Werewolf. Classy

00:38.560 --> 00:41.559
You should have seen
you guys' faces!

00:41.560 --> 00:43.560
Spencer, you're such a jerk!

00:47.600 --> 00:49.400
We need more wood.

00:52.520 --> 00:56.000
I'll go by myself, then, shall I?

00:58.000 --> 01:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:42.480 --> 01:43.840
Gross!

02:04.960 --> 02:06.640
Spencer?

02:09.880 --> 02:12.280
Come on, mate, seriously,
you're not funny any more.

03:07.800 --> 03:10.759
Ooo!
It's saying it's not in service.

03:10.760 --> 03:12.679
Why not try the place in town?

03:12.680 --> 03:14.719
This lot are mobile,
they could do my nails here,

03:14.720 --> 03:17.039
if they'd printed the right bloomin'
number!

03:17.040 --> 03:19.319
Ah! How was camping?

03:19.320 --> 03:21.559
Tense. Very funny.

03:21.560 --> 03:24.119
No, I'm serious.

03:24.120 --> 03:29.039
Look, a sheep killed
near where we pitched.

03:29.040 --> 03:32.559
Looked like a wild animal
had ripped it apart. Eurgh!

03:32.560 --> 03:34.639
I've heard there's been
a few attacks,

03:34.640 --> 03:36.639
but nothing this close
to Lighthaven.

03:36.640 --> 03:40.639
Barely got any sleep. The slightest
noise and everybody freaked out.

03:40.640 --> 03:42.959
What did they think it was -
a werewolf(?)

03:42.960 --> 03:46.479
Probably. You know what people
around here are like.

03:46.480 --> 03:48.760
Beware... the moon!

03:51.720 --> 03:54.719
May I remind you that you're
from around here.

03:54.720 --> 03:58.039
We're not all superstitious yokels,
you know. Just saying.

03:58.040 --> 04:01.759
Anyway,
it would've been the panther.

04:01.760 --> 04:04.200
I'll get it.

04:12.320 --> 04:14.199
Oh, hi. Hi!

04:14.200 --> 04:16.640
Oh. I'll get Mum.
Wait! Are you Beth?

04:17.720 --> 04:20.039
Ben Fairhead, Lighthaven Star.

04:20.040 --> 04:23.199
If it's about one of Mum's cases,
I'm not allowed to talk to you.

04:23.200 --> 04:26.759
I'm here about the photo
you tweeted. Of the sheep.

04:26.760 --> 04:28.479
You're here about a dead sheep?

04:28.480 --> 04:31.799
No, I'm investigating a recent spate
of animal attacks on the moors.

04:31.800 --> 04:34.439
It's a great shot, by the way.
You've got a good eye.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.159
Thanks.

04:36.160 --> 04:38.320
Look, it won't take long.
Yeah, sure.

04:39.480 --> 04:40.879
You're not the postman!

04:40.880 --> 04:44.679
No. No, I'm Ben Fairhead,
Lighthaven Star.

04:44.680 --> 04:47.399
French maid's costume
hasn't arrived yet.

04:47.400 --> 04:50.080
Mick will be so disappointed.

04:54.720 --> 04:57.159
I mean, obviously, I don't really
buy the whole big cat thing.

04:57.160 --> 04:58.639
Why not?

04:58.640 --> 05:03.079
Because the only predators in Devon
are seagulls... and squaddies.

05:03.080 --> 05:06.599
Before the 1976
Dangerous Wild Animals Act,

05:06.600 --> 05:11.359
some people, crazy, rich people,
they kept big cats.

05:11.360 --> 05:13.479
And then when the law changed,

05:13.480 --> 05:16.039
there were only so many that could
be taken by zoos.

05:16.040 --> 05:17.399
What, so, people just let them go?

05:17.400 --> 05:18.639
Where better than the moors?

05:18.640 --> 05:20.879
Massive spaces, lots of small,
furry things to eat.

05:20.880 --> 05:22.519
Yeah, but people would've seen them.

05:22.520 --> 05:24.919
People have seen them,
but they're never believed.

05:24.920 --> 05:27.039
Livestock's been going missing
for years,

05:27.040 --> 05:30.320
but it's always passed off
as road accidents or rustling.

05:31.720 --> 05:34.320
There's at least one big cat
out here, I swear.

05:35.960 --> 05:37.360
And I'm going to find it.

05:42.840 --> 05:44.879
It's my editor. I've got to go.

05:44.880 --> 05:46.239
Where?

05:46.240 --> 05:48.919
Police station.
Something's kicking off.

05:48.920 --> 05:51.719
Oh! Um... I can walk with you,
if you like?

05:51.720 --> 05:53.959
I'm going that way, anyway.

05:53.960 --> 05:57.439
You can tell me what to do if I get
cornered by a wild beast.

05:57.440 --> 05:58.960
All right.

06:05.240 --> 06:08.079
All right!
Yes, we are aware of the rumours.

06:08.080 --> 06:11.679
No, there is no such thing as a big
cat on the loose near Lighthaven.

06:11.680 --> 06:15.679
How can you be sure? That sheep was
found not 100 yards from my guesthouse!

06:15.680 --> 06:17.959
I rely on the summer's
tourist trade.

06:17.960 --> 06:21.159
Well, maybe it died of natural causes
and was eaten by smaller predators.

06:21.160 --> 06:23.919
I take ramblers up there every day.
If something happens... It won't!

06:23.920 --> 06:27.679
Am I supposed to let my flock
graze on the moors, or not?

06:27.680 --> 06:31.479
All right. Yes, the moors,
they're not always safe.

06:31.480 --> 06:33.079
You might fall down a crevasse,

06:33.080 --> 06:36.159
you might get set upon
by angry badgers.

06:36.160 --> 06:39.599
But eaten by a lion? No.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.319
It's not a lion!

06:41.320 --> 06:43.999
It's probably a melanistic leopard.
What?

06:44.000 --> 06:46.400
And it's perfectly capable
of doing this.

06:48.480 --> 06:50.639
And you have proof of this leopard,
do you?

06:50.640 --> 06:52.520
Yes, actually.

06:56.920 --> 06:58.999
That? That could be anything.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.919
So if none of you have anything
better, then the South Dart Police

07:01.920 --> 07:03.879
have more important matters
to attend to.

07:03.880 --> 07:07.200
But...! This is proof,
this is proof! We're done!

07:11.200 --> 07:13.439
Haven't you done enough damage?

07:13.440 --> 07:16.679
Why don't you stick to reporting
village fetes

07:16.680 --> 07:18.679
and leave the real journalism
to other people?!

07:18.680 --> 07:21.480
That weren't Ben's fault!
Yeah, leave him alone!

07:25.800 --> 07:28.359
Hey. Does this mean you've changed
your mind?

07:28.360 --> 07:29.919
No, Ben.

07:29.920 --> 07:32.400
I mean it, it's over.

07:38.240 --> 07:40.400
Do you want to talk about it?

07:49.040 --> 07:50.719
That's for me, right?

07:50.720 --> 07:52.320
All right, thanks.

08:10.120 --> 08:12.679
Hello, Jane? It's me.

08:12.680 --> 08:15.920
Look, do you fancy a drink later?
I've got a favour to ask.

08:17.040 --> 08:19.080
Yes, I'm buying.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.440
All right, thanks.

08:28.440 --> 08:30.680
Derrick!

08:41.360 --> 08:43.039
Here he is.

08:46.800 --> 08:48.639
Did you get me anything?

08:48.640 --> 08:50.719
Police are a joke!

08:50.720 --> 08:53.279
But don't worry, we've still got
enough for a front page.

08:53.280 --> 08:56.479
On the Beast? Please tell me
you've got me something else?

08:56.480 --> 08:58.839
This time, I've got
photographic evidence.

08:58.840 --> 09:01.560
I found this in a photographic
archive of the moors.

09:04.080 --> 09:08.439
And this... this is from last night.

09:08.440 --> 09:12.959
I mean, that's no dog.
Look at the depth of the wound!

09:12.960 --> 09:14.879
I like you, Ben,

09:14.880 --> 09:18.200
nobody can review a charity
coffee morning like you can.

09:19.240 --> 09:22.639
But you're not ready for the front
page. And even if you were,

09:22.640 --> 09:25.599
I'm not printing a picture
of a gutted sheep,

09:25.600 --> 09:27.679
and certainly not
an out-of-focus shot

09:27.680 --> 09:30.360
of what could very easily be a bush!

09:32.800 --> 09:35.719
Well, maybe I should write
a different story, then.

09:35.720 --> 09:37.719
An expose?

09:37.720 --> 09:40.199
The Shocking Truth Behind
The Lighthaven Star!

09:40.200 --> 09:42.480
Tread very carefully.

09:47.760 --> 09:49.359
OK. OK, I'll print the story,

09:49.360 --> 09:53.200
IF you get me proof, proper proof.

09:54.400 --> 09:56.559
In the meantime,
we still need someone

09:56.560 --> 09:59.000
for this week's
Lighthaven Life feature.

10:04.840 --> 10:06.119
What's so funny?

10:06.120 --> 10:08.839
I'm not asking a pathologist
to do a postmortem on a sheep!

10:08.840 --> 10:11.279
Look, if I could prove the sheep
wasn't killed by a big cat,

10:11.280 --> 10:13.399
then that bunch of lunatics
might leave me alone.

10:13.400 --> 10:16.159
Speak to a vet, or DEFRA.
Anyone that's not me.

10:16.160 --> 10:19.599
Why don't you try Paignton Zoo?

10:19.600 --> 10:22.360
Now, they've got big cats.
My nan used to take me.

10:26.200 --> 10:27.639
Well, at least ask!

10:27.640 --> 10:30.319
Come on, what's it worth?
Slap-up dinner?

10:30.320 --> 10:32.559
Ah! You old romantic!

10:32.560 --> 10:34.719
Wine, dinner,
cutting up a dead sheep.

10:34.720 --> 10:36.359
I'm not suggesting you do
it yourself.

10:36.360 --> 10:39.439
Have you any idea how long it takes
to get pathology reports on humans?

10:39.440 --> 10:40.879
Do you remember Gary Salter?

10:40.880 --> 10:42.399
Who? Tom and Elsa's boy.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.359
He crashed his motorbike
on the link road. Yeah.

10:44.360 --> 10:47.439
His parents disputed whether he was
under the influence of marijuana

10:47.440 --> 10:49.839
and it's taken weeks to get the tox
report back.

10:49.840 --> 10:52.519
So I'm sorry, dead sheep's
your problem, not mine.

10:52.520 --> 10:53.999
Jane Kennedy?

10:54.000 --> 10:56.039
Ben Fairhead, Lighthaven Star.

10:56.040 --> 10:58.879
Your daughter's nominated you to be
our Local Celebrity of the Week.

10:58.880 --> 11:00.759
Did she now?
Local Celebrity of the Week?

11:00.760 --> 11:02.919
Blimey, you're scraping the bottom
of the barrel!

11:02.920 --> 11:04.439
Quick photo, a few questions.

11:04.440 --> 11:06.159
Favourite song, pet hates.

11:06.160 --> 11:08.959
Pet hates, put, "nosey reporters".
It's not really a good time.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.759
All right. Tomorrow morning, then?
I'm not in the office, sorry.

11:11.760 --> 11:14.199
I've got a meeting with
the new undertaker first thing,

11:14.200 --> 11:17.079
then I've got to get over to Orlington.
I thought that wasn't until later?

11:17.080 --> 11:20.559
All right, well, I could meet you
somewhere on the way. Um...

11:20.560 --> 11:24.199
Fine. I can give you 15 minutes,
10:00.

11:24.200 --> 11:27.679
Let's say picnic area,
Penketh's Guesthouse.

11:27.680 --> 11:30.719
Amy Penketh's place?
Yeah. Is that a problem?

11:30.720 --> 11:33.959
Yeah, yeah, it's fine. 10:00.

11:33.960 --> 11:37.439
Just don't mention bloomin' big
cats, or you'll be there all day!

11:37.440 --> 11:39.119
Come on.

11:39.120 --> 11:42.399
Listen, it's not just sheep
that's gone missing.

11:42.400 --> 11:44.199
Eleanor Lawrence?

11:44.200 --> 11:47.439
She went for a walk on the moors 15
years ago and she never came back.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.639
It's not really a good time,
but I'll see you tomorrow.

11:49.640 --> 11:52.200
None of you want to believe me,
but it's true!

11:58.480 --> 12:01.159
Isn't he coming in?
He's a bit old for you, isn't he?

12:01.160 --> 12:03.159
And a couple of lions
short of a pride.

12:03.160 --> 12:07.159
I'm not interested, I just fancied getting
work experience at the local paper.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.439
That rag? It's all adverts nowadays.

12:09.440 --> 12:11.640
Well, either way,
you could do better.

12:14.080 --> 12:16.959
What? You said you were buying.
I'll have my usual, please.

12:16.960 --> 12:19.919
Cider for me. Rum and Coke. Um...

12:19.920 --> 12:22.160
All right, just Coke.

12:24.080 --> 12:25.959
Red wine, lager, cider, Coke.

12:25.960 --> 12:27.799
All in the same glass?

12:27.800 --> 12:29.639
Bad day, love?

12:29.640 --> 12:31.479
Just don't mention big cats.

12:31.480 --> 12:34.519
Ooo! The Beast of Lighthaven,
you mean?

12:34.520 --> 12:36.439
A huge panther.

12:36.440 --> 12:39.759
Razor-sharp claws,
fur black as the night.

12:39.760 --> 12:42.959
Many of my valued customers
have seen it with their own eyes.

12:42.960 --> 12:45.439
That's what happens when you spend
your life drinking scrumpy,

12:45.440 --> 12:47.559
you get holes in your brain.

12:47.560 --> 12:50.319
There's a cat out there, all right.

12:50.320 --> 12:52.159
You seen it, too?

12:52.160 --> 12:56.759
Clever animals.
Know better than to go near people.

12:56.760 --> 13:01.040
Still, only a matter of time
before one of them gets braver.

13:02.800 --> 13:07.159
If I were you, I'd stick to
the roads and keep off the moors.

13:07.160 --> 13:09.080
Especially at night.

14:25.720 --> 14:28.559
Cecil, din-dins!

14:28.560 --> 14:30.280
Cecil?

14:59.360 --> 15:02.520
Good luck with the hunt!
I'll do some sandwiches later!

15:07.600 --> 15:10.199
Anything else? No, thank you.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.519
Not looking for the panther,
are they?

15:12.520 --> 15:15.679
Well, that carcass was discovered
down that path there.

15:15.680 --> 15:17.640
The Beast must be close by.

15:19.600 --> 15:21.519
Waiting for someone? Journalist.

15:21.520 --> 15:24.239
Not that young 'un, Ben something?

15:24.240 --> 15:28.200
You know him? Ooo, he's got a cheek,
arranging meetings 'round here!

15:31.480 --> 15:33.640
Someone's in trouble.

15:46.640 --> 15:48.520
Those two found the body up here.

15:50.520 --> 15:53.599
No attempt to hide it, then,
is there? No.

15:53.600 --> 15:56.159
There's plenty of nooks
and crannies around here.

15:56.160 --> 15:58.559
You got any idea yet as to
the cause of death?

15:58.560 --> 16:00.879
Take a look for yourself.
There's something else, though.

16:00.880 --> 16:02.560
Yeah? What's that? We know him.

16:09.800 --> 16:12.200
Maybe the Beast of Lighthaven
isn't a myth after all.

16:31.760 --> 16:33.759
It's all about the Beast.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.279
He was obsessed!

16:35.280 --> 16:38.040
Hey, put that down. That's evidence.

16:41.240 --> 16:43.199
Right, so, what have we got?

16:43.200 --> 16:48.119
Food, Thermos, sleeping bag, torch.

16:48.120 --> 16:51.239
Looks like he was planning on making
a night of it, doesn't it?

16:51.240 --> 16:54.000
What do you think that is?
Evidence. Don't touch it.

16:55.360 --> 16:57.199
Next of kin?

16:57.200 --> 16:59.440
No. Parents both dead, no siblings.

17:00.840 --> 17:02.039
We'll keep looking, though.

17:02.040 --> 17:05.159
So, what's next? Because we both
know this wasn't a panther.

17:05.160 --> 17:08.358
You speak for yourself,
because I think the Beast did it.

17:08.359 --> 17:11.239
You're not serious? Yeah. Means
no crime was committed, doesn't it?

17:11.240 --> 17:13.520
The body's your problem, not mine.

17:15.680 --> 17:18.559
Beth. Everything OK? Is it true?

17:18.560 --> 17:20.959
That you found Ben's body?

17:20.960 --> 17:22.359
Wow! News travels fast.

17:24.920 --> 17:26.760
I can't believe it. Um...

17:29.000 --> 17:32.439
Does Gemma know? Gemma?
Yeah, Gemma Roxwell, his ex.

17:32.440 --> 17:34.599
They literally split up, like,
a few days ago.

17:34.600 --> 17:36.199
Do you know Gemma Roxwell?

17:36.200 --> 17:39.159
Yeah. Runs guided tours
for ramblers on the moors.

17:39.160 --> 17:42.199
Her dad owns a farm up there.

17:42.200 --> 17:45.199
Mum? Yeah, sorry.
I'll make sure she knows.

17:45.200 --> 17:48.759
I'll speak to you later, love.
OK. Bye.

17:48.760 --> 17:52.439
Ben's ex.
Good a place to start as any.

17:52.440 --> 17:55.519
And I'm not recording cause of
death as, "attacked by a big cat",

17:55.520 --> 17:58.000
until I've exhausted
all possibilities.

18:11.440 --> 18:12.880
He was nice, but...

18:15.560 --> 18:16.920
Not The One?

18:20.160 --> 18:21.600
How did he take it?

18:22.960 --> 18:24.959
Not great.

18:24.960 --> 18:29.559
But he cared more about finding
that stupid Beast than he did me.

18:29.560 --> 18:31.760
All he ever talked about.

18:34.800 --> 18:38.279
Can't blame him, I guess,
not after what happened to his mum.

18:38.280 --> 18:40.039
His mum?

18:40.040 --> 18:41.840
Eleanor Lawrence.

18:43.640 --> 18:46.119
Eleanor Lawrence? That's right.

18:46.120 --> 18:48.760
Fairhead's his foster parents' name.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.880
Ben believed the Beast killed her.

18:55.160 --> 18:57.240
He's been looking for it ever since.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.999
Had Ben been acting strangely,
or was he in any sort of trouble?

19:06.000 --> 19:07.999
No.

19:08.000 --> 19:12.079
He mentioned a couple of arguments
with his editor,

19:12.080 --> 19:13.840
but nothing serious.

19:17.240 --> 19:19.160
He didn't deserve this!

19:20.800 --> 19:23.080
I'll find out what happened,
I promise.

19:25.520 --> 19:29.920
Sorry, but... I've got
people waiting, so...

19:50.440 --> 19:52.839
Sorry to keep you waiting.

19:52.840 --> 19:55.559
I take it you're here about Ben.
Yes, that's right.

19:55.560 --> 19:57.199
I feel terrible.

19:57.200 --> 20:00.799
He spent years trying to convince me
there was a big cat,

20:00.800 --> 20:03.640
now he's... got himself killed
by the thing.

20:04.640 --> 20:06.559
You believe that's what happened?

20:06.560 --> 20:08.799
Isn't it? I heard his neck was...

20:08.800 --> 20:10.880
It's important to keep an open mind.

20:13.200 --> 20:16.439
I understand the two of you
had a few arguments recently.

20:16.440 --> 20:18.280
Not that I recall.

20:19.760 --> 20:23.800
A few professional disagreements,
maybe, same as any newsroom.

20:26.160 --> 20:28.159
Hello, there. Sorry to interrupt.

20:28.160 --> 20:31.079
I thought you were out confiscating
pitchforks from the angry mob?

20:31.080 --> 20:33.639
Yeah. That's sort of why I'm here,
really.

20:33.640 --> 20:35.879
Mr Mansfield, initial findings

20:35.880 --> 20:38.479
from Forensic are inconclusive,
I'm afraid.

20:38.480 --> 20:42.279
As of yet, we cannot confirm or deny
an animal attack.

20:42.280 --> 20:44.879
So...?
So it's a friendly request, really.

20:44.880 --> 20:47.319
If you couldn't print anything
that might cause undue alarm,

20:47.320 --> 20:50.159
at least until we find out
what's going on.

20:50.160 --> 20:52.839
Emotions are already running
fairly high.

20:52.840 --> 20:57.440
Fear not.
I'll choose my words very carefully.

21:12.400 --> 21:15.519
All I'm saying is stay off the moors
for the next few days.

21:15.520 --> 21:19.199
Why not stay here and enjoy a pint
of my new Beast Bite cider?

21:19.200 --> 21:22.679
If you stop folk going up to the
moors, then I'll be out of business!

21:22.680 --> 21:25.079
Surely the police would want people
to catch the Beast?!

21:25.080 --> 21:27.119
You go up there,
the cat will go to ground!

21:27.120 --> 21:28.719
All you'll do is frighten my sheep!

21:28.720 --> 21:30.119
Prefer they were cat food?

21:30.120 --> 21:32.399
Come on, everyone,
just calm down, please!

21:32.400 --> 21:34.959
And don't forget to pick up one of
our limited-edition T-shirts,

21:34.960 --> 21:37.799
as modelled by the gorgeous Judith!

21:37.800 --> 21:39.960
Oh!

21:41.520 --> 21:43.479
Available in all colours. Eh?

21:43.480 --> 21:46.319
Leave it to the professionals,
that's what I say. Thanks.

21:46.320 --> 21:48.680
All right, then, professional,
what is your plan?

21:51.920 --> 21:54.319
"Now the panther
has taste for human blood,

21:54.320 --> 21:57.079
"the town won't be safe
until it's caught." What an idiot!

21:57.080 --> 21:59.839
Yeah. Panther isn't even a species!

21:59.840 --> 22:02.479
I take it you got hold of someone
at the zoo?

22:02.480 --> 22:05.999
Head keeper.
Specialises in big cats.

22:06.000 --> 22:10.679
Did you know female lions have
a larger frontal cortex than males?

22:10.680 --> 22:13.159
I could've told you that.
Anyway, it turns out that panther

22:13.160 --> 22:17.719
is just an umbrella term
for black, big cats.

22:17.720 --> 22:20.319
From descriptions given
after sightings...

22:20.320 --> 22:21.719
Alleged sightings.

22:21.720 --> 22:23.919
..she agrees it could be
a black leopard.

22:23.920 --> 22:26.199
And Ben's wounds fit.

22:26.200 --> 22:28.519
Leopards, they target the neck, see?

22:28.520 --> 22:31.239
They're stealthy, solitary
and smart.

22:31.240 --> 22:35.079
Talking about me again?
Huh! You wish. What's with the bag?

22:35.080 --> 22:37.559
Well, thanks to our friends
at the Lighthaven Star,

22:37.560 --> 22:39.639
I've got to go traipsing
all over the moors

22:39.640 --> 22:42.479
looking for evidence of
big cat activity.

22:42.480 --> 22:45.119
CSI report. Oh. No paw prints.

22:45.120 --> 22:47.159
Well, if you are going on the hunt,

22:47.160 --> 22:49.079
you should take Bear Grylls
with you.

22:49.080 --> 22:51.879
He's now Lighthaven's
resident big cat expert.

22:51.880 --> 22:53.559
Really?
All right, the more the merrier.

22:53.560 --> 22:55.239
I haven't got a clue
what I'm looking for.

22:55.240 --> 22:57.679
And I'm already a laughing stock
down at the station, so...

22:57.680 --> 23:00.519
Aw, are they making fun of you
because of the nasty puddy-tat?

23:00.520 --> 23:03.919
Yeah, count me in!
I'd kill to get out of the office.

23:03.920 --> 23:06.239
We could take Ermintrude!
Who's Ermintrude?

23:06.240 --> 23:08.239
His campervan. I was joking.

23:08.240 --> 23:10.839
Oh, please! We could call it
an extended lunch break.

23:10.840 --> 23:12.439
Fine! Two hours, max.

23:12.440 --> 23:14.359
Don't come crying to me
if you both get eaten.

23:14.360 --> 23:16.959
Admit it, you'd miss us.
Well, I'd miss Clint.

23:16.960 --> 23:19.200
Aw, thanks! I hate doing filing.

23:20.440 --> 23:24.160
As for you... I'd get over you.

23:39.920 --> 23:42.359
I'll be honest, Ben,

23:42.360 --> 23:43.839
I believe in the Beast of Lighthaven

23:43.840 --> 23:46.880
about as much as I believe in
the Abominable Snowman.

23:48.600 --> 23:51.280
You were so sure the Beast exists,
weren't you?

23:52.360 --> 23:55.920
Maybe you could've convinced me,
but I guess it's too late now.

24:01.280 --> 24:02.880
Unless...

24:07.680 --> 24:14.520
Right, we'll
start over... over... there.

24:20.480 --> 24:22.879
So, do you think we'll find it?
No, not a cat's chance in hell.

24:22.880 --> 24:25.559
But I've got to be seen
to be trying.

24:25.560 --> 24:29.439
We'll do small circles, radiating
out from where the body was found.

24:29.440 --> 24:32.279
Keep your eyes peeled. For what?

24:32.280 --> 24:34.439
Oh, I dunno,
you're the big cat expert.

24:34.440 --> 24:36.919
Anything out of the ordinary.
Tracks.

24:36.920 --> 24:38.879
Yeah, tracks, things like that.

24:38.880 --> 24:41.480
No. Tracks, there, look!

24:49.040 --> 24:50.360
Oh, yeah.

24:52.760 --> 24:54.119
Yeah, car tracks.

24:54.120 --> 24:56.959
Big, heavy one, too,
by the look of it.

24:56.960 --> 24:59.959
Could it be one of your
forensics lot?

24:59.960 --> 25:03.200
No. No, they came up the same path,
from the south.

25:06.520 --> 25:08.160
Someone else has been up here.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.800
Come on.

25:20.360 --> 25:22.400
Just a minute.

25:30.560 --> 25:32.319
Guilty as charged.

25:32.320 --> 25:34.439
DS Higgins is out for your blood.

25:34.440 --> 25:38.119
I was merely trying to warn our
readership about a credible threat.

25:38.120 --> 25:40.519
You were merely trying to sell
papers.

25:40.520 --> 25:42.719
You say that like it's a bad thing.

25:42.720 --> 25:45.679
Regional-print journalism
isn't exactly booming.

25:45.680 --> 25:48.839
Well, luckily for you, I know
the perfect way to redeem yourself.

25:48.840 --> 25:51.559
I need access to your archives.

25:51.560 --> 25:55.039
Can I ask what you're looking for?
Everything Ben wrote on the Beast.

25:55.040 --> 25:58.200
I want to decide for myself
if there's any truth in it.

26:09.160 --> 26:11.759
What's over there?
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!

26:11.760 --> 26:13.160
Easy, tiger.

26:15.240 --> 26:16.719
That's just a farm.

26:16.720 --> 26:20.039
Looks like the farmer's
pretty worried about the Beast.

26:20.040 --> 26:22.519
Yeah, maybe.

26:22.520 --> 26:24.839
Though I don't suppose leopards
are normally scared off

26:24.840 --> 26:27.160
by security cameras.

26:33.760 --> 26:35.800
Tell me that was thunder.

26:37.520 --> 26:40.440
Shall we call it quits for the day?
Works for me.

26:49.200 --> 26:50.479
Hi, there.

26:50.480 --> 26:53.159
Hi, it's Jane Kennedy,
I'm the coroner for Lighthaven.

26:53.160 --> 26:55.200
Do you have the PM on Ben Fairhead?

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
Fine. Can you just call me
when you're done? Thanks. Bye.

27:22.080 --> 27:25.759
Oh, please, tell me
this is a wind-up!

27:25.760 --> 27:28.159
Do you know anything about motors?

27:28.160 --> 27:29.999
Do I look like a mechanic?

27:30.000 --> 27:34.480
Well, now that you mention it...
Be very careful what you say next.

27:37.920 --> 27:41.520
Huh! No phone signal, for a change!

27:42.640 --> 27:44.399
So, what now?

27:44.400 --> 27:46.919
What, we just spend the night
out here?

27:46.920 --> 27:50.719
Well... it's 2:20 now.

27:50.720 --> 27:53.920
I'm sure we could walk to Lighthaven
before nightfall.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.520
With any luck,
it won't come to that.

28:12.680 --> 28:16.519
Problems? Yeah. Any chance you can
give us a lift back to town?

28:16.520 --> 28:19.359
I was only going as far as
the supermarket.

28:19.360 --> 28:21.120
Close enough.

28:23.760 --> 28:25.520
Hiya.

28:44.080 --> 28:46.440
Come on, Davey, pick up! Pick up!

28:52.400 --> 28:55.279
Hey. What's up?
Ah! I've finally got through to you.

28:55.280 --> 28:59.119
Listen, I think I've found someone
who had a grudge against Ben.

28:59.120 --> 29:01.079
Oh, yeah? Yeah.

29:01.080 --> 29:03.359
You know the lady who runs
the guesthouse on the moors road,

29:03.360 --> 29:04.680
near where he was found?

29:06.160 --> 29:08.119
Yeah, yeah, I know her.

29:08.120 --> 29:11.159
Yeah. Ben wrote an article
about her, saying that she had...

29:11.160 --> 29:12.759
I'll call you back.

29:12.760 --> 29:14.360
Wha...?

29:15.720 --> 29:17.360
Could you pull over?

29:23.000 --> 29:26.119
Ben blew that salmonella story
totally out of proportion!

29:26.120 --> 29:29.400
One dodgy batch from a supplier's
not my fault!

29:30.680 --> 29:32.919
He ruined my business' reputation!

29:32.920 --> 29:36.079
So, you wanted to get your own back?
That's not what I'm saying!

29:36.080 --> 29:38.639
And when we test the blood
on that rug...

29:38.640 --> 29:40.239
It'll come back as ovine.

29:40.240 --> 29:42.119
Ovine?

29:42.120 --> 29:44.759
And there's sheep's blood
in your car because...?

29:44.760 --> 29:46.240
None of your business!

29:50.440 --> 29:53.039
I heard that the guesthouses on
the north moor were packed out

29:53.040 --> 29:55.039
with tourists wanting to see
the big cat, so I...

29:55.040 --> 29:57.039
So, you staged an animal attack?

29:57.040 --> 29:59.399
I found the sheep at the side
of the road!

29:59.400 --> 30:00.840
Must've been hit by a car.

30:02.360 --> 30:05.639
I dumped it up on the moors, nearby
where those kids were camping.

30:05.640 --> 30:07.479
But that sheep had been ripped
to pieces.

30:07.480 --> 30:09.199
I was brought up on a farm!

30:09.200 --> 30:11.560
Done worse things in time than
gutting a sheep!

30:13.120 --> 30:15.639
Add a few claw marks
and Bob's your uncle.

30:15.640 --> 30:17.320
I was desperate!

30:18.760 --> 30:21.919
Since that salmonella outbreak,
my bookings have plummeted.

30:21.920 --> 30:23.400
And Ben Fairhead?

30:25.000 --> 30:26.199
Did you stage that, as well?

30:26.200 --> 30:29.480
Look, whatever he did to me... I... I
wouldn't wish that on him.

30:31.080 --> 30:33.840
Especially after what happened
to his poor mum.

30:35.200 --> 30:37.719
I remember seeing her picture
in the paper, poor woman.

30:37.720 --> 30:39.199
Horrible mess.

30:39.200 --> 30:40.919
All right, Amy.

30:40.920 --> 30:44.680
You got anything else to add? No?

30:45.880 --> 30:48.440
Interview suspended at 15:15.

30:58.200 --> 31:00.039
I believe her.

31:00.040 --> 31:03.599
Yeah. What did she mean about
pictures in the paper?

31:03.600 --> 31:05.759
I thought Ben's mum disappeared.

31:05.760 --> 31:07.079
Disappeared?

31:07.080 --> 31:08.239
Yeah. Ben said she went...

31:08.240 --> 31:10.559
No. Eleanor Lawrence was murdered.

31:10.560 --> 31:13.319
By Ben's father, Graeme.

31:13.320 --> 31:14.999
Dumped her body on the moors.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.239
Unrecognisable, she was.

31:16.240 --> 31:19.679
Graeme confessed and killed himself
in prison a couple of months later.

31:19.680 --> 31:21.439
Why didn't you say anything?

31:21.440 --> 31:23.719
Well, I thought you knew.
National press at the time.

31:23.720 --> 31:25.519
When was this?

31:25.520 --> 31:27.159
15 years ago.

31:27.160 --> 31:28.439
Oh! Beth would've been tiny.

31:28.440 --> 31:31.279
I was probably sat in my flat
in Edinburgh watching Teletubbies.

31:31.280 --> 31:33.399
I can't believe
you didn't mention this!

31:33.400 --> 31:36.319
Well, it's not something people
around here like to talk about.

31:36.320 --> 31:39.320
Ben's father was the original
Beast of Lighthaven.

31:42.120 --> 31:44.519
Don't go anywhere
without telling us.

31:44.520 --> 31:47.879
If you're looking for a bad guy,
what about that Samuel Mansfield?

31:47.880 --> 31:49.239
Nasty piece of work!

31:49.240 --> 31:51.680
Oh, really? What makes you say that?

31:53.240 --> 31:56.559
Well, after the salmonella story,
I asked for compensation.

31:56.560 --> 31:58.839
Instead, he rocks up
in a brand-new Jaguar,

31:58.840 --> 32:00.519
threatening me with all sorts!

32:00.520 --> 32:03.000
Hardly a good advert
for a community paper.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.880
What? Get in the car.

32:13.840 --> 32:15.639
If times are so hard
for print journalism,

32:15.640 --> 32:18.199
how come you're driving around
in a brand-new sports car?

32:18.200 --> 32:21.400
What can I say? Midlife crisis.

32:22.720 --> 32:25.359
So I went through
a stack of old editions earlier.

32:25.360 --> 32:27.879
Like DS Higgins says,
they're full of adverts nowadays.

32:27.880 --> 32:31.839
Yeah. A lot of new clients.
Congratulations. Thank you.

32:31.840 --> 32:34.679
Strange thing is, most of these
companies, I've never heard of.

32:34.680 --> 32:37.719
Some don't have contact details, or,
if they do, the numbers don't work.

32:37.720 --> 32:40.599
It's up to individual advertisers
to check all the content.

32:40.600 --> 32:43.399
We've done some digging and most of
these companies don't exist.

32:43.400 --> 32:45.719
Businesses, they come, they go.

32:45.720 --> 32:48.479
People just skim over the ads,
don't they?

32:48.480 --> 32:50.719
So if I called a mobile nail salon,
for example,

32:50.720 --> 32:52.919
and no-one picked up,
who'd think anything of it?

32:52.920 --> 32:54.919
Sorry, is there a point to all this?

32:54.920 --> 32:56.679
No. No, you're right.

32:56.680 --> 32:58.479
I'll just go back, get a warrant,

32:58.480 --> 33:01.040
come back, go through the paperwork,
it'll be much quicker. OK.

33:03.560 --> 33:06.519
A while ago, I was approached
by a new media agency.

33:06.520 --> 33:09.239
They offered me... a deal.

33:09.240 --> 33:10.919
What kind of deal?

33:10.920 --> 33:14.119
They pay me above the going rate
for advertising space,

33:14.120 --> 33:17.279
supply all the content,
I pay them a commission.

33:17.280 --> 33:19.359
How big's the commission?

33:19.360 --> 33:21.639
It's generous.

33:21.640 --> 33:24.559
And I assume this agency
pays you in cash?

33:24.560 --> 33:27.159
Is that a crime?

33:27.160 --> 33:30.040
No. But money laundering is.

33:31.800 --> 33:33.400
Let's not get carried away.

33:34.640 --> 33:37.679
So Ben found out what you were up to
and you had to shut him up.

33:37.680 --> 33:39.879
No!

33:39.880 --> 33:42.439
He was a bit of a prat sometimes,
but I quite liked him.

33:42.440 --> 33:44.599
I swear, I had absolutely
nothing to do with his death.

33:44.600 --> 33:47.080
My daughter took this photo.

33:48.840 --> 33:51.399
I wouldn't know. Ben brought it in.

33:51.400 --> 33:53.840
Reckoned it proves the Beast
is real.

33:55.160 --> 33:56.879
It's the same number Ben had on him.

33:56.880 --> 33:58.479
Yeah, it's a holding number.

33:58.480 --> 34:00.159
Identifies the farm the sheep
came from.

34:00.160 --> 34:03.599
So... are we done here?

34:03.600 --> 34:05.799
No, not even close.

34:05.800 --> 34:08.599
My friends in the fraud squad
will be very happy to meet you.

34:08.600 --> 34:11.399
Sam Mansfield, you're under arrest
for money laundering.

34:11.400 --> 34:13.719
You don't have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence

34:13.719 --> 34:15.239
if you do not mention
when questioned

34:15.239 --> 34:17.000
something that you later
rely on in court.

34:22.400 --> 34:24.799
Oh! This hold music's killing me!

34:24.800 --> 34:26.879
Tough.
I need an ID on that holding number.

34:26.880 --> 34:28.918
You know, that editor's
as crooked as they come,

34:28.920 --> 34:30.998
but I can't see him cutting up Ben
like this.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.719
Nor me. Hello?

34:32.719 --> 34:35.119
Yeah. Yeah, that's brilliant.

34:35.120 --> 34:37.719
Yeah, I'll let her know.
All right, thanks.

34:37.719 --> 34:39.319
Roxwell Farm.

34:39.320 --> 34:42.079
Great. So if Ben went looking for
the Beast the night he was killed,

34:42.080 --> 34:44.279
I bet that's where he started.

34:44.280 --> 34:46.839
And you said there was CCTV
on the farm buildings.

34:46.840 --> 34:48.799
Well, maybe they caught something.
Yeah, maybe.

34:48.800 --> 34:52.080
Come on! Don't you want to know
if the Beast really exists?

35:05.880 --> 35:07.400
Dogs.

35:08.520 --> 35:11.479
Dogs? Pathologist found a few hairs.

35:11.480 --> 35:14.439
What if John Roxwell's
holding illegal dogfights?

35:14.440 --> 35:17.799
They're always on isolated farms
like this, away from prying eyes.

35:17.800 --> 35:20.919
Ben starts nosing around...
Got himself mauled. Yeah.

35:20.920 --> 35:24.319
To be honest, it doesn't sound much
more plausible than panther attack,

35:24.320 --> 35:26.720
but I suppose I could go and get
a warrant.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.159
Hey! Where are you going?

35:32.160 --> 35:34.920
We're lost. I'm going to find
someone to ask for directions.

35:37.200 --> 35:38.799
Can you smell something funny?

35:38.800 --> 35:40.599
I assumed that was your
new aftershave.

35:40.600 --> 35:41.839
No, no, no, I'm being serious.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.639
No. All I can...

35:43.640 --> 35:45.119
See? Dogs!

35:45.120 --> 35:47.399
No, correction, dog. Dog.

35:47.400 --> 35:50.199
Need more than one for a fight,
don't you?

35:50.200 --> 35:52.000
All right, easy, Fido.

36:05.080 --> 36:07.680
You get the feeling he doesn't want
anyone looking in here?

36:23.360 --> 36:25.000
Oh, hey, hey!

36:29.240 --> 36:31.079
You putting on weight?

36:31.080 --> 36:32.440
You want a slap?

36:33.600 --> 36:34.960
Oh!

36:43.160 --> 36:44.520
Anything?

36:46.000 --> 36:47.280
Yeah.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.520
Dogs?

36:52.040 --> 36:53.479
No, not dogs.

36:53.480 --> 36:54.840
Well, what, then?

36:57.000 --> 36:59.879
Enough cannabis to fuel
the second coming of Woodstock.

36:59.880 --> 37:02.240
Davey?

37:06.440 --> 37:08.040
Davey?

37:09.520 --> 37:11.440
Davey, did you hear me?

37:12.800 --> 37:14.360
Yeah, I heard you.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.399
Come on, John, put the gun down.

37:25.400 --> 37:27.039
I'm sure we can talk about this.

37:27.040 --> 37:28.599
Too late.

37:28.600 --> 37:31.519
All right, well, I have to let you know,
my colleagues are on their way, so...

37:31.520 --> 37:33.519
Shut up! Look, we're not here about
the cannabis,

37:33.520 --> 37:35.599
we just want to know
what happened to Ben.

37:35.600 --> 37:37.199
Ben?

37:37.200 --> 37:38.599
How should I know?

37:38.600 --> 37:41.399
I'm now thinking you didn't want
a journalist nosing around,

37:41.400 --> 37:42.919
so you got Gemma to break up
with him,

37:42.920 --> 37:44.439
only he didn't take the hint,
did he?

37:44.440 --> 37:48.399
Did he find out what you were up
to and you set the dog on him?

37:48.400 --> 37:50.999
All right, hey, take it easy.
I'm sure there's an explanation.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.559
You just meant to scare him off and
something went wrong. Am I right?

37:54.560 --> 37:56.759
Come on, John, don't do this.

37:56.760 --> 37:58.239
You shouldn't have come here.

37:58.240 --> 37:59.479
Dad, what's happening?

37:59.480 --> 38:01.960
Go in the house! We know about Ben.

38:03.600 --> 38:06.719
You know? It's what you said,
he was trespassing.

38:06.720 --> 38:10.439
I set the dog on him.
And that's that.

38:10.440 --> 38:12.639
No, he was your daughter's
boyfriend,

38:12.640 --> 38:14.479
he wasn't some random burglar.

38:14.480 --> 38:17.119
And if you were defending
your property, why move the body,

38:17.120 --> 38:18.760
why not just call the police?

38:20.120 --> 38:23.679
You knew you had to silence him,
so you... you killed him

38:23.680 --> 38:25.999
and dumped his body on the moors
to pin it on the Beast,

38:26.000 --> 38:27.719
keep people away from this place!

38:27.720 --> 38:29.839
No, no, that's not what happened!
All of you, shut up!

38:29.840 --> 38:31.119
Dad, please don't do this!

38:31.120 --> 38:33.599
She's right, John, come on,
don't make this worse for yourself.

38:33.600 --> 38:35.239
Worse?

38:35.240 --> 38:37.959
Ever since that maniac
killed my Eleanor,

38:37.960 --> 38:42.959
all I've been doing is... is scraping
by, trying to make ends meet.

38:42.960 --> 38:44.680
I just wanted to stay
on my own land!

38:46.920 --> 38:50.479
Well... I'm not going down
without a fight.

38:50.480 --> 38:52.759
So, what's it to be, ladies first?

38:52.760 --> 38:54.360
No! No!

38:56.000 --> 38:57.999
Me first. If you insist.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.639
Dad, no!

38:59.640 --> 39:02.679
Go in the house, Gem!
I don't want you seeing this!

39:02.680 --> 39:04.399
Dad... It's a single barrel,
isn't it?

39:04.400 --> 39:06.079
If he fires it, then you leg it.

39:06.080 --> 39:09.039
Please don't do this! No, John,
come on, listen to your daughter!

39:09.040 --> 39:11.759
She loves you. Can you imagine
what this would do to her?!

39:11.760 --> 39:14.960
John, please! Please!
You can make this all right!

39:16.400 --> 39:17.720
John, please!

39:30.680 --> 39:33.079
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I've messed it all up!

39:33.080 --> 39:35.399
Please, Dad, please!
John Roxwell, I'm arresting you

39:35.400 --> 39:37.279
on suspicion of the murder
of Ben Fairhead.

39:37.280 --> 39:39.079
You do not have to say
anything, but...

39:39.080 --> 39:40.759
No! Wait! Wait, wait!

39:40.760 --> 39:42.879
Are you going to let your dad
go down for murder,

39:42.880 --> 39:45.079
or are you going
to tell us what really happened?

39:45.080 --> 39:47.359
No!

39:47.360 --> 39:49.000
I...

39:52.120 --> 39:54.480
It was an accident.

39:57.960 --> 39:59.600
Come on, John.

40:10.760 --> 40:12.999
Ben had been drinking on the moors.

40:13.000 --> 40:16.320
I didn't want to see him,
but I was worried he'd wake up Dad.

40:17.680 --> 40:19.599
Were you scared of Ben?

40:19.600 --> 40:21.559
Gemma, I need to talk to you!
We have to be quiet.

40:21.560 --> 40:24.039
Dad will freak if he finds you here.
I need to know the truth!

40:24.040 --> 40:26.639
He was so nice most of the time,

40:26.640 --> 40:29.319
but you'd get these flashes
of temper.

40:29.320 --> 40:31.919
Please! Is there someone else?

40:31.920 --> 40:34.800
No! This wasn't working out! Liar!

40:38.480 --> 40:42.040
Dad had... had an affair
with Ben's mother.

40:43.040 --> 40:44.799
It went on for years.

40:44.800 --> 40:47.159
Eventually, Ben's father found out

40:47.160 --> 40:49.480
and that's why he killed her.

40:51.880 --> 40:54.399
So Ben convinced himself his mum
was killed by the Beast,

40:54.400 --> 40:56.760
because it was easier
than accepting the truth.

41:00.240 --> 41:02.479
Wait! Is Ben your half-brother?

41:02.480 --> 41:03.959
I don't know.

41:03.960 --> 41:05.959
Dad doesn't know.

41:05.960 --> 41:11.119
But when I told Ben the truth
about the affair, he just went mad.

41:11.120 --> 41:14.279
He kept saying I was lying! He kept
going on and on about the Beast!

41:14.280 --> 41:16.319
I don't care what you think!

41:16.320 --> 41:18.239
Do you know what, I've been alone
my entire life

41:18.240 --> 41:22.040
and I'm not going to let you
leave me! Argh! Argh!

41:23.800 --> 41:25.120
No!

41:26.640 --> 41:27.960
Argh!

41:29.440 --> 41:30.840
Gemma?

41:32.400 --> 41:33.920
Ben?

41:39.840 --> 41:43.560
Then your dad put Ben's body in
the trunk and left him on the moors?

41:45.600 --> 41:47.800
I don't know if he was trying
to protect me, or...

41:49.760 --> 41:52.880
..he just didn't want police
crawling around his farm.

41:59.920 --> 42:02.119
Right, what do I owe you?

42:02.120 --> 42:05.919
I reckon you deserve a round on
the house, after what you did today.

42:05.920 --> 42:07.680
Thanks, Judith.

42:11.880 --> 42:15.199
On the house.
Could this day get any better?

42:15.200 --> 42:18.239
You enjoy having a gun
being pointed at you?

42:18.240 --> 42:20.159
Thanks again, by the way.

42:20.160 --> 42:22.559
Oh, forget about it.
I should be thanking you.

42:22.560 --> 42:25.199
Turns out John Roxwell
was providing storage

42:25.200 --> 42:27.399
for the largest drugs gang
in the southwest.

42:27.400 --> 42:31.239
And our friend at the Lighthaven Star has told
us where they were laundering their money, so...

42:31.240 --> 42:33.639
Well, don't expect
your picture in the paper.

42:33.640 --> 42:35.879
With their lead journalist dead
and the editor banged up,

42:35.880 --> 42:38.840
I imagine the Star's going to be
offline for a while.

42:40.240 --> 42:42.840
I still can't believe you were
willing to take a bullet for me.

42:44.520 --> 42:46.199
Ah, don't be daft!

42:46.200 --> 42:48.040
I knew he wasn't going to shoot.

42:51.520 --> 42:53.040
Davey?

42:55.400 --> 42:56.920
Thank you.

42:59.760 --> 43:02.439
Hey, look, some of my friends
recorded this on the moors.

43:02.440 --> 43:03.920
It's proof.

43:06.440 --> 43:10.399
I knew it! I told you there were
big cats on that moor!

43:10.400 --> 43:11.720
Let me see that.

43:19.400 --> 43:20.919
Lemonade, please, Mick.

43:20.920 --> 43:22.560
I found it online.

43:24.600 --> 43:26.680
Cheers.

43:28.960 --> 43:30.560
Go on.

43:31.720 --> 43:33.239
I don't know whether I mentioned,

43:33.240 --> 43:35.879
I'm now taking orders for our new
Beast of Lighthaven mugs,

43:35.880 --> 43:38.680
key rings and cuddly toys!
