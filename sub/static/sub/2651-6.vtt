WEBVTT

00:03.440 --> 00:04.920
Jay, should I get rid of this?

00:05.000 --> 00:06.559
The hat, the jacket
or the cane?

00:06.640 --> 00:08.199
Actually, yes. Just yes.

00:08.320 --> 00:10.312
We're having a yard sale
for our social studies class...

00:10.400 --> 00:11.834
to raise money for UNICEF.

00:11.920 --> 00:14.230
The point is for us to learn
about global altruism.

00:14.320 --> 00:15.834
No, the point is for us...

00:15.920 --> 00:17.559
to raise more money
than Miss Cooper's class,

00:17.640 --> 00:20.155
so we get a pizza
and a pool party.

00:20.240 --> 00:22.471
Your cynicism makes
me sad for our world.

00:22.560 --> 00:26.190
Ease up, Delgado.
I've seen you with a pizza.

00:26.280 --> 00:29.398
Ah, I hate garage sales. Bunch of shady
characters going through my stuff.

00:29.480 --> 00:30.994
Why can't I just write a check?

00:31.080 --> 00:33.834
Ay, relax, Jay. It's just a
couple of people in the driveway.

00:33.920 --> 00:35.354
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's where it starts.

00:35.440 --> 00:37.272
Then it's,
"It's just a local call."

00:37.360 --> 00:39.829
"Can I use your bathroom?"
"My mother needs to lie down."

00:39.920 --> 00:41.400
No, it just stinks.

00:42.880 --> 00:44.519
He did write a check.
Shh!

00:44.600 --> 00:46.796
The less he knows, the better.

00:46.920 --> 00:49.355
- You're not even here anymore.
- But it's my stuff.

00:49.440 --> 00:51.511
Where's Mom?
Luke, take me to Mom.

00:51.600 --> 00:53.671
And move slow.
I'm still drunk-

00:53.760 --> 00:55.877
...ing my coffee. Mom?

00:55.960 --> 00:57.872
What's the problem?

00:57.960 --> 00:59.758
Uh, tell Luke not
to sell my stuff.

00:59.840 --> 01:01.513
Honey, come on. Give it up.

01:01.600 --> 01:04.160
Even John Mayer doesn't have
a John Mayer poster anymore.

01:04.239 --> 01:05.754
It's signed by him.

01:05.840 --> 01:07.274
It's time you knew.
They come that way.

01:07.360 --> 01:09.636
But it's "To Haley."

01:09.720 --> 01:11.791
In a different color.
Your dad wrote that.

01:11.880 --> 01:14.600
Ew! He wrote
my body is a wonderland.

01:14.720 --> 01:16.439
I didn't catch that till after.

01:16.520 --> 01:18.830
Mom, is it okay if Michael
comes to the yard sale?

01:18.920 --> 01:21.230
Well, honey, didn't you
see him last night?

01:21.320 --> 01:23.437
So? Why don't you like
my boyfriend?

01:23.560 --> 01:25.392
I do like him.

01:25.520 --> 01:28.752
I'm just 90% sure
he's 100% gay.

01:28.840 --> 01:30.354
Yes. When Michael
took me to prom,

01:30.440 --> 01:32.238
I questioned his sexuality.

01:32.360 --> 01:34.795
But then... we made out.

01:34.880 --> 01:36.758
A couple times.

01:36.840 --> 01:39.958
There was even a little
under-the-shirt action.

01:41.800 --> 01:44.474
His chest is very smooth.

01:44.560 --> 01:46.836
Heads up!
Coming through!

01:46.960 --> 01:49.555
Wow! I am glad you're finally
getting rid of that thing.

01:49.640 --> 01:51.757
What? I'm not selling
this bad boy.

01:51.880 --> 01:54.793
I was gonna meet you at your dad's and
get a little exercise on the way.

01:54.880 --> 01:56.880
What's, uh-What's your
beef with my StreetStrider?

01:56.920 --> 01:58.991
Even I think it's nerdy,
and I'm fluent in Elvish.

01:59.080 --> 02:00.958
It's not nerdy.
Luke, back me up.

02:01.040 --> 02:04.795
I hope you mean into the garage,
because I have friends on this street.

02:04.880 --> 02:07.475
Honey, you finally found
something less cool...

02:07.560 --> 02:09.517
than those pants
that zip off into shorts.

02:09.600 --> 02:12.399
My shants, which you have been
gunning for since day one.

02:12.480 --> 02:14.472
Does it matter to any of you
that this is actually...

02:14.560 --> 02:17.758
an extremely efficient cardiovascular
workout that could prolong my life?

02:17.840 --> 02:22.278
Mmm, yeah. But what kind of life?
And... with whom?

02:26.200 --> 02:26.948
♪ Hey, hey ♪

02:34.040 --> 02:35.394
♪ Hey♪ ♪

02:37.920 --> 02:40.116
Remember, everyone,
this is for charity.

02:40.200 --> 02:42.874
Every dollar we earn helps
a diseased child,

02:42.960 --> 02:44.440
a starving child,
an abused child.

02:44.560 --> 02:45.994
Now have fun!

02:46.080 --> 02:48.640
Speaking of starving children,
here's my contribution.

02:48.720 --> 02:52.111
Six pair of jeans that don't fit me
anymore because I've lost 25 pounds.

02:52.200 --> 02:54.635
That's like one, two,
three children's bowling balls.

02:54.720 --> 02:56.279
- Oh, bravo!
- Hey!

02:56.360 --> 02:57.840
Very nice.

02:57.920 --> 02:59.957
Hey, Cam, are you really
getting rid of all these?

03:00.040 --> 03:02.475
I mean, they're almost new.
It's-Well, what if you, um-

03:02.560 --> 03:04.080
What if I what?
Put the weight back on?

03:04.160 --> 03:05.640
No! No.

03:05.720 --> 03:07.393
No, what if you-

03:07.480 --> 03:10.200
you think of some creative
art project that requires denim?

03:10.280 --> 03:13.193
You know, something farm-
or Kelly Clarkson-themed?

03:13.280 --> 03:14.920
I've already done so much
with that motif.

03:14.960 --> 03:17.998
Yeah. Yeah. You know what? No, sell 'em!
I wanna purge.

03:18.080 --> 03:21.312
Which, for the record,
is not how I lost this weight.

03:21.400 --> 03:24.472
Oh. Every time. Every time he loses
weight, he gets rid of his big pants.

03:24.600 --> 03:27.195
And when he puts the weight back on,
he has to buy them all new again.

03:27.280 --> 03:30.114
- It-It's a nightmare.
- Just put the jeans in the car while he's in the house.

03:30.200 --> 03:31.714
No, Dad!
That's incredibly dis-

03:31.800 --> 03:34.190
I'm gonna do that. Yeah.

03:34.320 --> 03:37.320
Whoa! Where do you think you're goin' with those?
Oh, these aren't for sale.

03:37.360 --> 03:39.033
Hey, this is for charity.

03:39.120 --> 03:42.511
You know you're taking those jeans out of
the hands of some needy giant children.

03:42.600 --> 03:44.637
You know they're not getting
the actual jeans, right, Luke?

03:44.720 --> 03:47.360
Oh, right. Well,
then how about a donation?

03:47.480 --> 03:49.995
Twenty bucks?
A hundred.

03:50.080 --> 03:52.197
- Twenty?
- Sure. What's it to you...

03:52.280 --> 03:54.556
if some kid gets sick
bathing in Poo River, Africa?

03:54.640 --> 03:57.109
- Ew.
- How much for the ashtray?

03:57.200 --> 03:59.192
I don't know.
What's the tag say?

03:59.280 --> 04:01.033
Fifty cents.
But there's a chip in it.

04:01.120 --> 04:03.112
Well, that's why it's lying
on a blanket on my lawn...

04:03.200 --> 04:05.317
next to some old
corn on the cob handles.

04:05.440 --> 04:09.434
- I'll give you 35.
- You're wearing a $10,000 watch. You're haggling over 15 cents?

04:09.560 --> 04:11.995
You live in this place, and you
can't let that 15 cents go?

04:12.080 --> 04:13.275
Fine, 35.

04:13.360 --> 04:15.113
- Can you break a 50?
- Get out.

04:22.560 --> 04:23.880
Manny.

04:23.960 --> 04:25.519
What is this case doing here?

04:25.600 --> 04:28.718
I found it in the attic.
Why? What is it?

04:28.800 --> 04:31.269
Nothing that concerns you.
It's from Colombia.

04:31.400 --> 04:34.074
But I thought you said-
You thought nothing.

04:37.160 --> 04:40.039
It's going back in the attic,
and I want no more questions.

04:40.120 --> 04:41.793
- Why?
- That's a question.

04:44.280 --> 04:47.159
Wow. That was weird.
Too weird.

04:47.240 --> 04:48.754
I wonder what's in there.

04:48.840 --> 04:50.877
Wake up, Delgado!

04:50.960 --> 04:54.840
Locked box. From Colombia.
"No more questions"?

04:54.920 --> 04:56.718
It's obviously a human head.

04:56.800 --> 04:58.359
Why is that always
your first guess?

04:58.440 --> 05:01.433
One of these days,
I'm gonna be right.

05:03.280 --> 05:05.476
No way!
You're selling the Harley?

05:05.560 --> 05:07.472
No, I'm just trying
to move it out of the way.

05:07.560 --> 05:10.280
Some asshat offered me
100 bucks for it.

05:10.400 --> 05:13.472
But with the baby coming, I guess I
am gonna sell it. Oh, she's a beaut.

05:13.560 --> 05:15.677
What? You wouldn't be
interested in it, would you?

05:15.760 --> 05:17.194
Why wouldn't I be?

05:17.280 --> 05:20.079
Well, I just never thought of
you as a motorcycle kinda guy.

05:20.160 --> 05:22.595
I would be if Claire would
ever let me have one.

05:22.680 --> 05:25.752
- You can have a motorcycle if you want.
- Ha, ha, ha!

05:25.840 --> 05:28.230
Can I also have an affair
with my super hot receptionist?

05:28.320 --> 05:30.755
- What super hot receptionist?
- Don't change the subject.

05:30.840 --> 05:32.797
Now what would everybody
like for lunch?

05:32.880 --> 05:35.349
You don't have to buy a
motorcycle if you don't want one.

05:35.480 --> 05:37.711
But don't blame it on me.
I'm fine with it.

05:37.840 --> 05:39.399
Seriously?
Yeah!

05:39.480 --> 05:41.597
Yeah, look, I know it's not
the safest thing in the world,

05:41.680 --> 05:44.036
but it is sexy.

05:44.160 --> 05:48.359
Yes. A lot more sexy than that
crazy machine you rode up on. Mmm.

05:48.440 --> 05:50.352
Is that something that
your doctor make you use?

05:50.440 --> 05:52.750
All right, I'm gonna
take this around back,

05:52.840 --> 05:54.672
unless you'd like
to go for a test-drive.

05:54.760 --> 05:56.877
Sure. Let's go. Not too fast.

05:57.000 --> 05:57.990
Precious cargo.

05:58.080 --> 05:59.280
I'm not taking you, sweetheart.

05:59.320 --> 06:00.993
I'm driving?

06:01.080 --> 06:05.074
Awesome!

06:05.160 --> 06:07.880
I'm terrified of motorcycles, but
sometimes you have to do things...

06:07.960 --> 06:10.873
to show the world
you're still a man.

06:10.960 --> 06:13.839
Same reason I got
that henna tattoo.

06:13.920 --> 06:16.833
Japanese symbol for "courage."

06:16.960 --> 06:18.633
Yeah. Oh,
Michael's here!

06:18.720 --> 06:21.155
Hi, Michael!
Hi!

06:21.240 --> 06:22.879
Well, well, well.
What is this all about?

06:22.960 --> 06:25.600
Is there a-a new man
in Alex's life?

06:25.680 --> 06:27.160
Well, she certainly thinks so.

06:27.280 --> 06:29.280
Is there any
way that boy is straight?

06:29.320 --> 06:30.959
Ooh, what's going on?
Who are we looking at?

06:31.040 --> 06:33.874
Uh, it's Alex's
new "boyfriend," Michael.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.117
What's up with the air quotes?
She thinks he's gay.

06:36.200 --> 06:39.272
I "think" he's gay the same way
I "think" that lamp is hideous.

06:39.360 --> 06:41.317
Okay, brought it.
Made it in art class.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.551
Look, I like Michael.
I really do.

06:43.640 --> 06:45.711
I just-I don't want her
to get her heart broken.

06:45.840 --> 06:48.150
When it comes to boys, her
self-esteem is low enough as it is.

06:48.240 --> 06:49.920
I don't know. Alex seems
pretty darn tough.

06:49.960 --> 06:52.555
Oh, she's just sarcastic
on the outside.

06:52.680 --> 06:55.149
Inside, she's just
a fragile little girl.

06:55.240 --> 06:57.360
Yes, by all means, look right
at me when you say that.

06:57.400 --> 06:59.392
If she wants to get her
heart broken by a gay guy,

06:59.520 --> 07:02.911
she can do so when she's 18 or 19
and can drink her way through it.

07:03.040 --> 07:05.077
Aw. You're a "good
mother." Mm-hmm.

07:05.160 --> 07:07.038
I don't know. You could be wrong.
Boys aren't as concerned...

07:07.120 --> 07:08.918
about traditional
masculinity anymore.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.834
You know, they're not butching it up.
They're not pushing down their feelings.

07:11.960 --> 07:13.640
Yeah, they care about their clothes.
Mm-hmm.

07:13.680 --> 07:15.000
They-They-They groom. Mm-hmm.

07:15.120 --> 07:16.793
Everybody's hairless.
Yeah.

07:16.920 --> 07:18.481
You can't tell anything anymore.
Mm-mmm.

07:18.520 --> 07:19.954
Really?

07:20.040 --> 07:22.271
Hey. Hey. Uncle Mitch, Uncle
Cam, this is Michael.

07:22.360 --> 07:23.714
Hi!
Hello.

07:23.800 --> 07:26.235
Hi!
Okay, come on.

07:27.680 --> 07:29.194
Yep, he's gay.
We stand corrected.

07:29.280 --> 07:30.794
Yeah.

07:35.520 --> 07:38.274
Okay.

07:38.400 --> 07:41.040
Now be careful. I don't
want you to crash. Aw!

07:41.120 --> 07:43.715
- I don't want the bike all scratched up.
- Oh.

07:43.800 --> 07:46.156
And don't be nervous. People make
mistakes when they're nervous.

07:46.240 --> 07:47.754
I'm not nervous.

07:47.840 --> 07:50.594
I've had bigger hogs than this
between my legs.

07:54.920 --> 07:57.640
He really oughta run things
through his head first.

07:57.720 --> 07:59.791
Yeah.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.714
I know. I looked
super cool on the outside,

08:02.800 --> 08:05.520
but on the inside,
I was terrified.

08:05.600 --> 08:09.719
And then I remembered that Fonzie once put
together a whole motorcycle while blind.

08:09.840 --> 08:12.480
And I thought,
"That was a great show,"

08:12.560 --> 08:15.519
and I got really distracted
and-and I forgot I was scared.

08:15.640 --> 08:18.599
So I headed up the canyon,
and I left the city behind.

08:18.680 --> 08:20.672
I've never felt so exhilarated.

08:20.760 --> 08:22.319
I don't know
exactly when it happened,

08:22.480 --> 08:25.075
but somewhere on that
lonely road-

08:25.160 --> 08:26.514
The bike and I became one.

08:26.600 --> 08:29.593
Oh. Oh. Oh, no.

08:29.680 --> 08:30.955
No. Oh, you're heavy!

08:31.040 --> 08:32.554
No! Oh!

08:38.200 --> 08:40.157
Uh-oh.

08:40.240 --> 08:42.515
Lock the door.

08:44.360 --> 08:46.113
Okay. Let's do this.

08:46.200 --> 08:48.999
No matter what we find in here,
I will always love my mother.

08:49.080 --> 08:50.434
Even if it's a head?

08:50.560 --> 08:52.074
It's not a head.

08:53.960 --> 08:56.759
Oh, my God! It's a head!
Ah! Finally!

08:58.320 --> 09:00.994
Mitchell! I was just in the car,
and I found my fat pants in there.

09:01.120 --> 09:03.840
Do you know anything about that?
What? No! No.

09:03.920 --> 09:05.354
Did you forget to put 'em out?

09:05.480 --> 09:07.836
No. Remember? I posed. People clapped.
I had my moment.

09:07.920 --> 09:10.355
I do remember that. That-
Oh, that was a great moment.

09:10.440 --> 09:13.160
I am so proud of you.

09:13.280 --> 09:14.794
What's going on?
You're being weird.

09:14.880 --> 09:16.599
What? First
I'm a pants thief,

09:16.680 --> 09:18.558
and-and now I can't
pay you a compliment?

09:18.640 --> 09:20.279
You know who's being weird?
You.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.238
Here comes Claire.
Hey, girl!

09:22.320 --> 09:23.549
I don't know what that was.

09:23.640 --> 09:27.520
Okay, I just saw Alex and
Michael sittin' in a tree.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.592
Don't make me
spell this out for you.

09:29.680 --> 09:31.239
Well, what can you do?

09:31.320 --> 09:33.357
I can't do anything, but
you two could talk to her.

09:33.480 --> 09:35.437
And tell her what? Michael's
playing for the pink team.

09:35.520 --> 09:37.240
Okay. We get to say that.
You don't, really.

09:37.280 --> 09:38.760
I know, because you
have credibility,

09:38.840 --> 09:41.674
and I have the opposite
of credibility. I have-

09:41.760 --> 09:43.513
I am her mother.

09:43.640 --> 09:46.235
Okay, we're not doing this. Well,
now hold on just a minute.

09:46.320 --> 09:48.835
You know, when I was...
young and straight,

09:48.920 --> 09:50.912
I left a trail of broken
hearts like a rock star.

09:51.040 --> 09:52.841
I'm not proud of it.
You're kinda proud of it.

09:52.920 --> 09:55.435
You work it into a lot of conversations.
He brought it up yesterday.

09:55.520 --> 09:57.600
Okay, how am I supposed
to walk into a dry cleaner...

09:57.640 --> 09:59.871
and not mention my girlfriend
Wendy Jo Martinizer?

09:59.960 --> 10:01.474
Can we get back to my problem?

10:01.560 --> 10:03.597
You don't have a problem, okay?
They're kids.

10:03.680 --> 10:05.273
They're gonna work it out.

10:05.360 --> 10:06.999
Can you talk to her?

10:07.080 --> 10:09.356
Not when she's like this.

10:09.480 --> 10:10.960
Oh, you mean Alex.
Mmm.

10:11.040 --> 10:12.394
Yeah. I'll do it.

10:12.480 --> 10:14.199
Thank you.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.590
Claire, kids,

10:16.720 --> 10:19.155
if you're seeing this,
then they found my body.

10:19.240 --> 10:21.960
Or I finally got a signal and I
sent it to you in an e-mail.

10:22.040 --> 10:23.713
Although in that case,
I'd just call.

10:23.800 --> 10:26.952
But sometimes you can actually get a
pretty decent data signal and no voice.

10:27.040 --> 10:29.157
I know,
I'm not making any sense.

10:29.240 --> 10:32.039
I've been trapped
out here now for...

10:32.120 --> 10:33.839
27 minutes.

10:33.960 --> 10:36.111
I'm such an idiot.

10:36.200 --> 10:38.510
Why did I bring this stupid
motorcycle out here?

10:38.600 --> 10:40.034
To prove I'm a man?

10:40.200 --> 10:41.321
I am a man.

10:44.320 --> 10:45.356
Mom.

10:45.440 --> 10:47.432
Manny, what is this doing here?

10:47.520 --> 10:50.035
If you don't mind, we'll be
asking the questions now.

10:50.120 --> 10:51.315
I do mind.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.073
I apologize.

10:53.160 --> 10:54.833
We couldn't help ourselves.

10:54.920 --> 10:58.152
But I've gotta know.
Why were you hiding this?

11:00.960 --> 11:03.429
Love this! Sold!

11:03.520 --> 11:05.000
What's the story here?

11:05.080 --> 11:06.799
I don't want to talk about it!

11:06.920 --> 11:09.640
Aw! Cute! Oh, where'd
that come from?

11:09.720 --> 11:11.837
It's my mom's.
She's being very cagey.

11:11.920 --> 11:13.752
We think something's
stashed in the head.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.309
It's from Colombia.

11:16.400 --> 11:18.119
Mom, what's the big deal?

11:19.440 --> 11:21.477
Okay, fine.

11:21.560 --> 11:24.553
When I was young,
I was in a beauty pageant.

11:24.640 --> 11:26.597
All the other girls,
for the talent,

11:26.680 --> 11:29.912
were juggling knives,
as they always do.

11:30.040 --> 11:33.238
But I wanted to stand out,
so I came up with...

11:33.320 --> 11:35.755
Uncle Grumpy.

11:35.880 --> 11:38.918
Okay. Never been so happy. Not leaving
till I see it. Hit it, Gloria.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.878
- Excuse me. How much is this vase?
- It's yours. Take it.

11:40.960 --> 11:43.839
So what do you need here? A stool? Glass of water?
How do we make this happen?

11:43.920 --> 11:46.480
- Let's go. I need to see this.
- You see nothing.

11:46.600 --> 11:50.230
That pageant was one of
the worst nights of my life.

11:50.320 --> 11:53.392
After weeks of rehearsing,

11:53.480 --> 11:56.075
I froze,
and we were speechless.

11:56.160 --> 11:57.640
Aw, and you lost.

11:58.480 --> 11:59.994
No. I won.

12:00.080 --> 12:03.517
Imagine this when I was 18.

12:03.600 --> 12:06.479
But it was very humiliating.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.916
I don't want to do it
ever again.

12:09.040 --> 12:11.236
And yet you kept him
all these years.

12:11.320 --> 12:15.075
Maybe there's a part of you that wants
to work through this, get some closure.

12:15.160 --> 12:17.994
You're wrong, whoever you are.

12:21.440 --> 12:23.875
It's going on 31 minutes.

12:23.960 --> 12:26.031
I feel so alone.

12:26.120 --> 12:28.840
I gotta get my leg free.

12:36.320 --> 12:41.156
Why didn't I wear my shants?

12:43.600 --> 12:46.957
Hey, guys. Check it out. You
like my new bracelet? Oh, cute.

12:47.040 --> 12:48.633
It's an old curtain ring
Michael saw over there.

12:48.720 --> 12:51.599
He braided three leather
shoelaces around it and voilà.

12:54.800 --> 12:57.872
You know, Alex, you and
Michael remind me so much...

12:57.960 --> 13:00.429
of me and my first girlfriend,
Annabelle Pickett.

13:00.560 --> 13:02.358
Huh? You had a girlfriend?
Oh.

13:02.440 --> 13:04.113
Yeah. Cutest girl
in Sunday school too.

13:04.200 --> 13:07.716
So one year, I asked her to go to the
church bazaar lip sync contest with me,

13:07.800 --> 13:10.110
and we did our version
of "Endless Love."

13:10.200 --> 13:12.271
Which was ironic,
because two weeks later,

13:12.360 --> 13:13.953
I fell head over heels...

13:14.040 --> 13:16.953
for a young, square-jawed rodeo
ticket taker named Woody Ray.

13:17.080 --> 13:20.073
Oh, no. Of course, she was devastated.
Just destroyed her.

13:20.160 --> 13:21.958
And then she spray-painted
something unrepeatable...

13:22.040 --> 13:24.032
on my daddy's barn
and never spoke to me again.

13:24.120 --> 13:26.801
Wow, and all because she wanted you
to be something you just weren't.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.160
Mm-hmm. Ugh. Yeah.

13:28.240 --> 13:30.755
Stop. I get it. I know what
you think about Michael, Mom.

13:30.840 --> 13:33.240
You didn't have to bring in your
big gay guns to back you up.

13:33.320 --> 13:34.436
No offense.

13:34.520 --> 13:36.637
None taken.
I kinda like it.

13:36.720 --> 13:39.360
Okay. Honey, I am worried about you.
I don't want you to get hurt.

13:39.440 --> 13:41.671
I told them that this was
a bad idea, all right?

13:41.760 --> 13:44.229
You know, maybe Michael's gay.
Maybe he's not.

13:44.320 --> 13:47.472
He is. Your mother just wants you
to have all the information...

13:47.560 --> 13:49.040
so that you can go slow.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.794
Uncle Mitchell, he's straight.

13:51.880 --> 13:52.870
We kissed.

13:52.960 --> 13:54.792
Oh, honey, I-

13:54.880 --> 13:57.714
I kissed a lot of girls
when I wanted to be straight.

13:57.800 --> 13:59.871
And your Uncle Cam
kissed some too, he says.

13:59.960 --> 14:01.633
But that's neither here
nor there.

14:01.720 --> 14:04.474
What's important is that you make your
own-Where-Wait, where are you going?

14:04.560 --> 14:07.314
It's not the olden days anymore, you guys.
I can just ask him.

14:07.440 --> 14:08.794
Oh.
Hope you're happy.

14:08.880 --> 14:11.475
I'm not. That "olden days" comment
was like a punch to the gut.

14:11.560 --> 14:13.517
She may as well have spray-painted
it on my daddy's barn.

14:13.640 --> 14:15.677
I'm done with this. Where's he going?

14:15.760 --> 14:18.400
Hey, you got any bread? I wanna
make sure this thing still works.

14:18.520 --> 14:20.876
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.
Oh, it doesn't have to be bread.

14:20.960 --> 14:24.840
I mean, I can get the information I need
from, like, a bagel or a frozen waffle.

14:24.920 --> 14:27.400
Look, kid, you're just gonna have
to roll the dice on this one.

14:27.480 --> 14:29.756
I don't know.

14:29.840 --> 14:31.320
What's your return policy?

14:31.400 --> 14:33.631
You return, I call the police.

14:33.720 --> 14:35.313
Wh-Where'd you get that?

14:35.440 --> 14:37.193
From the kitchen.
Give me that!

14:39.240 --> 14:41.914
You selling the pot-bellied pig?
Get out of my driveway.

14:44.360 --> 14:46.033
You're not a pig.

14:46.120 --> 14:48.077
You're Daddy's little girl.

14:52.240 --> 14:53.390
There you are.

14:53.480 --> 14:54.834
Hey. Sorry.

14:54.920 --> 14:57.230
I got lost in this Elle Decor.

14:57.320 --> 15:00.074
Justin Timberlake is
designing his own home line,

15:00.160 --> 15:01.992
and I'm trying
to reserve judgment.

15:03.160 --> 15:06.676
Michael, I have
to ask you something.

15:06.800 --> 15:09.474
I want you to know
it's okay either way, but...

15:11.040 --> 15:12.315
are you gay?

15:12.400 --> 15:14.232
What?

15:14.320 --> 15:16.960
No! I'm not!
I-I took you to prom.

15:17.040 --> 15:18.554
I kissed you.

15:18.640 --> 15:20.757
Unless you're a boy, I'm
pretty sure I'm straight.

15:20.840 --> 15:22.160
Are-Are you a boy?

15:22.280 --> 15:23.760
No.
Right.

15:23.840 --> 15:26.036
So then I'm straight.

15:26.160 --> 15:28.277
I didn't mean to make you mad.
I'm not mad.

15:28.360 --> 15:31.319
I'm just... angry.

15:31.400 --> 15:32.880
I'm sorry.

15:32.960 --> 15:34.792
And those are synonyms.

15:34.880 --> 15:37.076
You just know everhing today.

15:37.160 --> 15:39.311
Can you just give me a minute?

15:41.000 --> 15:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

15:50.240 --> 15:54.519
- Hey. Can I help you?
- Yeah. Why does everybody think I'm gay?

15:55.520 --> 15:57.671
God, I hate yard sales.

16:01.560 --> 16:03.552
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

16:04.880 --> 16:07.081
Sorry for snooping around
and finding your old-man doll.

16:07.160 --> 16:09.959
In Colombia, if you snoop
around the wrong box,

16:10.040 --> 16:12.475
you might end up
inside that box.

16:12.560 --> 16:15.200
I shouldn't have done it.
Now I feel bad for Manny.

16:16.320 --> 16:19.040
- What do you mean?
- Well, I don't know.

16:19.120 --> 16:20.840
He's always talking about
how brave you are,

16:20.920 --> 16:22.559
how you're not afraid
of anything.

16:22.680 --> 16:25.798
Now he just seems a little sad.
How sad?

16:25.920 --> 16:27.832
Don't worry.
It's a good thing.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.718
He needs a little dose
of reality.

16:29.840 --> 16:33.117
You walk around school telling everyone
how great your mommy is all the time,

16:33.200 --> 16:35.556
you find yourself on the
business end of a wedgie.

16:38.040 --> 16:40.509
I know how to push buttons
to get what I want,

16:40.600 --> 16:43.399
and what I want
is to see a puppet show.

16:45.200 --> 16:46.111
J'accuse!

16:46.200 --> 16:48.192
I'm sorry.
One more time?

16:48.280 --> 16:52.160
It's just a dramatic way of accusing you
of stashing my fat pants in a bush!

16:52.320 --> 16:54.118
Saboteur!
That's a second way.

16:54.240 --> 16:55.879
How... could... you?

16:55.960 --> 16:57.110
And a third.

16:57.240 --> 17:00.199
Why, Mitchell? Why?
Cam-Oh, come on.

17:00.280 --> 17:01.509
All right, the-

17:01.600 --> 17:03.637
This is a little hard
to say, but...

17:03.720 --> 17:06.997
every time you get rid of these pants,
you have to buy them all over again,

17:07.079 --> 17:09.549
and you get depressed,
all right?

17:09.640 --> 17:12.314
This is just a way
to have a safety net.

17:12.400 --> 17:13.880
I can't have a safety net,
Mitchell.

17:13.960 --> 17:16.201
Otherwise, I won't be successful
and keep the weight off.

17:16.280 --> 17:17.794
Have you ever thought of that?

17:19.040 --> 17:20.952
No. No, I didn't.

17:21.040 --> 17:24.511
You know, you're not the only one who
remembers all the times I failed.

17:26.079 --> 17:27.560
You're right.

17:27.640 --> 17:29.950
I-I should support you more.
I'm-I'm sorry.

17:30.080 --> 17:32.680
Well, I'm happy to hear you say that.
Well, I'm happy you're happy.

17:32.720 --> 17:33.960
Well, I hope
you both are happy.

17:34.040 --> 17:35.918
Michael's not gay.
Now he hates me.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.514
Thanks a lot.

17:37.600 --> 17:41.196
You see? This is exactly why I
didn't want to get involved.

17:42.800 --> 17:45.076
Now I feel terrible.

17:45.160 --> 17:47.470
These feelings would go good
with pie.

17:49.280 --> 17:51.749
There he is!

17:54.360 --> 17:56.955
Sweetheart, do you love it?

17:57.040 --> 17:58.440
No, Claire, I do not love it.

17:58.520 --> 18:01.115
Oh, that's too bad, 'cause
you look so cool on that.

18:01.200 --> 18:03.760
Do I, Claire? Do I really?

18:03.880 --> 18:06.520
What happened? It's a long story.
Check your in-box.

18:06.640 --> 18:09.235
But suffice it to say, I'm not
buying that motorcycle. Uh-huh.

18:09.320 --> 18:13.030
I know what I am, Claire. I'm not a rider.
I'm a strider.

18:13.120 --> 18:15.555
I hope that's
sexy enough for you.

18:15.680 --> 18:18.559
Well, I can see stuff. Yeah, I know.
I can feel air on it.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.521
Mmm. It's not like I have
another pair of pants.

18:20.560 --> 18:22.870
Well, uh, today is
your lucky day.

18:22.960 --> 18:24.440
It's for a good cause.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.034
You might need a belt.

18:26.120 --> 18:28.157
Oh, I doubt it.
I bet we wear the same size.

18:28.240 --> 18:30.914
- Don't do that.
- Copy.

18:32.040 --> 18:34.635
Well, we ruined Alex's life,
by the way.

18:34.720 --> 18:37.110
I don't know.
She looks okay.

18:37.240 --> 18:39.800
- Oh, looks like they made up.
- Hmm.

18:39.880 --> 18:42.440
Wish she would just listen to me. I
could help her avoid so much pain.

18:42.520 --> 18:44.273
Give it a rest.
She's 14, all right?

18:44.400 --> 18:47.393
No matter who that boy is, he's not gonna last.
Mmm. You're right.

18:47.520 --> 18:48.954
Well, at least with a gay kid,

18:49.040 --> 18:50.713
you know she's gonna get
a great flower arrangement.

18:50.800 --> 18:52.473
Should've seen the one
I made Annabelle.

18:52.560 --> 18:54.870
Arranged it myself.
It was gorgeous.

18:54.960 --> 18:58.590
Till she pulled it apart
and spelled "homo" on my porch.

18:58.680 --> 19:00.558
This doesn't make me
feel any better.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.313
Gather around, everybody.

19:02.400 --> 19:04.392
I want you to meet somebody.

19:04.480 --> 19:07.314
Oh, but that might.
Uncle Grumpy!

19:08.680 --> 19:11.070
Luke's wise words got to me.

19:11.160 --> 19:14.153
I needed my son
to respect me again.

19:14.240 --> 19:17.950
More than that,
I needed to respect myself.

19:18.040 --> 19:19.952
Holy maracas!

19:20.040 --> 19:22.953
I think I sat on the right lap!

19:23.040 --> 19:26.477
Uncle Grumpy, we're in public.

19:26.600 --> 19:29.513
Ay, look at
all those white faces!

19:29.600 --> 19:32.718
I see we made it over the wall!

19:32.800 --> 19:34.837
Uncle Grumpy,
are you in a bad mood?

19:34.920 --> 19:39.153
Damn right, I am!
I just came from the movies.

19:39.280 --> 19:43.718
A whole day's pay
to see Basic instinct.

19:43.800 --> 19:46.360
Oh. And what did you think?

19:46.440 --> 19:48.397
Basically, it stinks.

19:49.760 --> 19:51.513
You're so grumpy.

19:51.600 --> 19:53.319
Damn right, I am!

19:53.400 --> 19:56.279
I just met
the girl of my dreams.

19:56.360 --> 19:57.919
Ay, that's such great news.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.357
No!
She gave me the termites.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.000
Gloria, I'm just gonna-

20:04.080 --> 20:06.311
Oh, geez. I don't even wanna know
what this is. I'm outta here.

20:06.440 --> 20:07.715
You're leaving?
Damn right.

20:07.800 --> 20:09.712
The only difference between
this and a home invasion...

20:09.800 --> 20:12.713
is I get to shoot people
at a home invasion.

20:12.800 --> 20:15.952
Oh, my God.
She married her puppet.

20:18.480 --> 20:20.039
Encore!
Encore!

20:20.120 --> 20:21.998
Uncle Grumpy!

20:25.160 --> 20:28.676
Can anyone hear me?

20:28.760 --> 20:30.911
Please help me!

20:31.040 --> 20:32.759
I don't wanna die!

20:32.840 --> 20:36.550
If I had to make a playlist for
being trapped under a motorcycle,

20:36.640 --> 20:38.711
it'd be, um,

20:38.840 --> 20:41.560
"Stuck in the Middle,"
"Hit the Road, Jack"-

20:41.640 --> 20:44.712
Um, anything by Heavy D.

20:44.800 --> 20:46.951
Ooh. Pointer Sisters,
"Neutron Dance."

20:47.040 --> 20:52.559
Turns out today wasn't the first
day of the rest of my life.

20:52.640 --> 20:54.518
Oh, my goodness.

20:54.600 --> 20:57.434
There are some DVDs in a shoe
box in, uh, my closet...

20:57.520 --> 20:59.830
that I was holding for a buddy.

20:59.920 --> 21:02.515
Um, you can go ahead and just
throw the whole box away.

21:13.320 --> 21:16.074
I'm so hungry.

21:16.160 --> 21:19.073
I don't know how long
I'm gonna be out here.

21:19.160 --> 21:21.436
I gotta ration my food.

21:28.880 --> 21:31.998
I said "No tomatoes"!

21:32.305 --> 21:38.310
