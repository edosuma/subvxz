WEBVTT

00:08.575 --> 00:09.643
GORDON: Stop it.

00:09.643 --> 00:11.178
OWEN: You have...
GORDON: Blow in the lungs?

00:15.516 --> 00:17.084
(laughs).

00:18.051 --> 00:19.453
GORDON: That is a
big pair of lungs.

00:19.453 --> 00:21.188
OWEN: Yes.
GORDON: Big breath?

00:21.188 --> 00:22.823
OWEN: Yes.

00:22.823 --> 00:24.791
(exhaling)

00:27.261 --> 00:28.395
Almost.

00:28.395 --> 00:29.396
GORDON: Still more?

00:29.396 --> 00:32.933
OWEN: Yes. Almost. Almost.

00:41.174 --> 00:43.176
GORDON: This is
Southeast Alaska.

00:43.176 --> 00:45.879
America's final frontier.

00:47.314 --> 00:50.817
I'm on the Southern
Alaskan panhandle in the
middle of winter and

00:52.019 --> 00:54.855
I can't wait
to see what this icy
wilderness has to offer.

00:56.790 --> 00:59.192
This narrow
strip of coastline
and offshore islands

00:59.192 --> 01:01.128
is exposed to
all the elements...

01:03.864 --> 01:06.033
And I mean all the elements.

01:06.366 --> 01:08.702
It's one of the most brutal
environments on the planet.

01:10.837 --> 01:12.205
Which is another way of

01:12.205 --> 01:15.776
saying it's bloody cold
and full of animals
that can kill you.

01:17.010 --> 01:20.814
Over the years the locals
have adapted to the harsh
conditions and created

01:20.814 --> 01:25.285
delicious food from
their wild bounty and I
can't wait to explore.

01:30.290 --> 01:31.992
To start my wild adventure,

01:31.992 --> 01:35.162
I'm meeting
a chef and hunter who's
redefining Alaskan food.

01:36.763 --> 01:39.633
He wants to take me to
his favorite picnic spot.

01:39.633 --> 01:42.970
That just happens to be almost
3,000 feet up a mountain.

01:44.404 --> 01:48.609
But it's Alaska,
which means snow storms so
he sent me this flashy set of

01:48.609 --> 01:50.410
wheels to drive to the top.

01:57.551 --> 01:58.819
Lionel!

01:58.819 --> 02:01.088
LIONEL: Gordon!
GORDON: Oh, man!

02:01.088 --> 02:03.423
LIONEL: Welcome to Alaska.

02:03.423 --> 02:05.158
GORDON: Good to see you, man.

02:05.158 --> 02:06.493
LIONEL: Good to see you.

02:07.761 --> 02:10.697
GORDON: Lionel Udippa is
one of Alaska's top chefs.

02:10.697 --> 02:13.233
He's trained in some
of the best restaurants in
the world and he is now the

02:13.233 --> 02:15.535
Executive Chef
at Salt in Juneau.

02:17.170 --> 02:21.008
He's gained a reputation
for creating incredible
flavor combinations from

02:21.008 --> 02:23.377
the wild ingredients of
this glacial wonderland.

02:25.045 --> 02:28.115
GORDON: Oh, boy
it is freezing!

02:28.115 --> 02:29.182
LIONEL: A little bit.

02:29.182 --> 02:30.617
GORDON: Did you
bring some lunch?

02:30.617 --> 02:32.953
LIONEL: I did.
GORDON: I'm starving.
LIONEL: Alright.

02:32.953 --> 02:34.755
Well I'm gonna help you
put these snow shoes on,

02:34.755 --> 02:35.922
we're gonna go on
a little adventure.

02:35.922 --> 02:36.957
GORDON: Snow shoes?

02:36.957 --> 02:38.592
LIONEL: Yes.

02:40.761 --> 02:42.129
So what do you think
about Alaska so far?

02:42.129 --> 02:44.031
GORDON: Uh, bloody hard.

02:44.031 --> 02:46.166
This is insane.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.200
LIONEL: Do you
wanna move here?

02:47.200 --> 02:48.869
GORDON: In the summer, yes.

02:48.869 --> 02:52.172
Lionel has been hiking and
hunting in this freezing
wilderness since he was 18.

02:53.373 --> 02:56.209
Whereas I've lost all
feeling in my face and hands.

02:57.711 --> 02:59.212
GORDON: Any coffee nearby?

02:59.212 --> 03:00.681
LIONEL: Coffee?

03:00.681 --> 03:02.282
GORDON: (bleep).

03:02.282 --> 03:03.884
LIONEL: What the hell
are you doing, Gordon?

03:03.884 --> 03:04.918
Get up, let's go!

03:04.918 --> 03:05.986
GORDON: Taking a rest.

03:05.986 --> 03:07.220
LIONEL: Don't you
do triathlons?

03:07.220 --> 03:08.755
GORDON: I do but not
in the (bleep) snow!

03:08.755 --> 03:10.290
(laughs).

03:10.290 --> 03:13.093
Lionel lured me
up here with a promise
of an incredible view.

03:15.062 --> 03:18.165
But in this whiteout
the only thing I can see
is the end of my nose.

03:19.332 --> 03:21.468
LIONEL: Wow,
look at this view.

03:21.768 --> 03:24.471
GORDON: I just hope we
can still have lunch.

03:24.705 --> 03:25.839
That is beautiful.

03:25.839 --> 03:27.874
LIONEL: This is amazing.

03:30.444 --> 03:31.745
Alaska's all about survival.

03:31.745 --> 03:33.046
GORDON: Yep.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.248
So you're used to
this kind of terrain
for like six, seven

03:35.248 --> 03:36.349
months of the year.

03:36.349 --> 03:37.651
LIONEL: Yes, yes.
GORDON: Amazing.

03:37.651 --> 03:39.019
LIONEL: When
Alaska turns green,

03:39.019 --> 03:40.420
that's when we do
a lot of our foraging...

03:40.420 --> 03:42.055
GORDON: Right.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.458
LIONEL: Or hunting
or fishing and we do our best
to preserve these ingredients

03:44.458 --> 03:46.026
so that we have them
throughout the wintertime.

03:46.026 --> 03:48.762
And some
of those ingredients
I've brought with us,

03:48.762 --> 03:49.763
I wanna share with you.

03:49.763 --> 03:50.864
First is this mug.

03:50.864 --> 03:52.165
GORDON: Thank you.

03:52.165 --> 03:54.568
LIONEL: I'm gonna
give you some chaga
tea to warm you up.

03:55.402 --> 03:58.605
Chaga's a mushroom that's
harvested on birch trees.

03:59.339 --> 04:01.241
There's a little bit of
fireweed honey in this.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.210
GORDON: Beautiful.
LIONEL: Alright.

04:03.577 --> 04:04.978
GORDON: Cheers, Lionel.

04:04.978 --> 04:07.380
Thank you. Wow.

04:07.614 --> 04:10.050
LIONEL: It's high in
antioxidants along
with other vitamins.

04:10.050 --> 04:11.418
It's a fungus.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.186
GORDON: That's delicious and
that honey helps it as well,

04:13.186 --> 04:14.588
gives it that little
touch of sweetness
in there as well.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.423
LIONEL: Yes.

04:16.656 --> 04:18.992
And then I also brought
some other goodies for us.

04:18.992 --> 04:20.093
GORDON: What is that?

04:20.093 --> 04:21.628
LIONEL: Moose sticks.
GORDON: Moose sticks?

04:21.628 --> 04:23.263
LIONEL: Yes.

04:24.164 --> 04:25.365
GORDON: Stop messing around.

04:25.365 --> 04:26.466
LIONEL: No, I'm, I'm serious.

04:26.466 --> 04:27.501
GORDON: Moose sticks?

04:27.501 --> 04:28.568
LIONEL: Yes.

04:28.568 --> 04:29.970
GORDON: So it's like
a moose sausage?

04:29.970 --> 04:31.204
LIONEL: Correct.

04:31.204 --> 04:33.807
It's light, it's quiet,

04:34.574 --> 04:37.177
I eat a lot of these
when I go hunting or you
don't want the deer to

04:37.177 --> 04:38.345
hear you chew, right.

04:38.345 --> 04:39.679
GORDON: Right.

04:39.679 --> 04:41.047
LIONEL: So you gotta keep
as quiet as possible.

04:41.047 --> 04:42.616
Are you still hungry?

04:42.616 --> 04:45.252
This, right here is
king salmon belly.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.187
GORDON: King salmon belly.

04:47.187 --> 04:48.722
LIONEL: Huh‐huh.

04:52.392 --> 04:53.927
GORDON: That is delicious.

04:53.927 --> 04:55.962
Fatty, delicious,
salty, smoky.

04:55.962 --> 04:58.498
LIONEL: Mm‐mm.
This will be smoked
for about eight hours.

04:58.498 --> 05:00.167
GORDON: Really?
LIONEL: Mm‐mm.

05:00.167 --> 05:02.202
GORDON: That's like one
of the most exciting little
backpacks I've ever seen

05:02.202 --> 05:03.336
on a mountain.

05:03.336 --> 05:04.704
Um, my favorite has
to be the moose stick.

05:04.704 --> 05:06.439
LIONEL: Thank you.

05:06.673 --> 05:09.176
This is just a small
tasting of what we have
to offer in Alaska.

05:09.509 --> 05:13.013
In order for you
to really engage with this
land I'm going to send you

05:13.346 --> 05:15.115
off to Hoonah, Alaska.

05:15.115 --> 05:17.651
So you're gonna be
going that way, where
you can't see anything.

05:18.385 --> 05:21.555
GORDON: Lionel wants me
to start me journey in Hoonah
to learn about the wilderness

05:21.555 --> 05:25.058
from the residents
in this remote community
and then meet him back here

05:25.058 --> 05:28.061
at the end of the week to
cook for some local legends.

05:28.662 --> 05:31.131
LIONEL: We're gonna
cook in front of a,
a bunch of fishermen...

05:31.131 --> 05:32.499
GORDON: Right.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.301
LIONEL: And let me tell
you they're gonna judge
the hell out of you.

05:34.301 --> 05:36.503
GORDON: Fishermen are the
Alaskan food critics, right?

05:36.503 --> 05:37.571
LIONEL: Yes.

05:37.571 --> 05:39.039
GORDON: And anything
else to be aware of?

05:39.039 --> 05:40.307
LIONEL: Don't get
eaten by a bear.

05:40.307 --> 05:41.641
GORDON: Big bears?
LIONEL: Big bears.

05:41.641 --> 05:43.009
GORDON: Wouldn't they be
sleeping this time of year?

05:43.009 --> 05:44.177
LIONEL: Bigger than you.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.912
GORDON: They're
bigger than me. (bleep).

05:46.446 --> 05:47.981
(laughs).

05:53.386 --> 05:55.555
I've got one week
and two missions.

05:55.555 --> 05:58.458
Number one,
explore the panhandle and
design a menu based on

05:58.458 --> 06:00.126
it's wonderful ingredients.

06:00.460 --> 06:02.762
And number two, don't
get eaten by a bear.

06:06.132 --> 06:09.836
Chef Lionel told me to
start in Hoonah to learn how
people live off the land.

06:10.537 --> 06:11.771
Ready to go?

06:11.771 --> 06:13.039
CAPTAIN LEWIS:
Yeah, you wanna give
me a hand tying off?

06:13.039 --> 06:14.507
GORDON: Yes, please.
CAPTAIN LEWIS: Alright.

06:14.507 --> 06:17.244
GORDON: Local fisherman,
Captain Lewis, has
offered to give me a ride.

06:17.477 --> 06:19.045
CAPTAIN LEWIS:
Just gonna give us a little
shove and we'll be off.

06:19.045 --> 06:20.780
GORDON: Yes, thank you.

06:23.850 --> 06:27.654
Hoonah is located
on the Cicagof Island,
30 miles west of Juneau

06:29.956 --> 06:32.859
and is known to have more
brown bears than people.

06:33.627 --> 06:35.195
Just my luck.

06:35.662 --> 06:39.733
I'm off to meet the most
amazing Tlingit community,
they hunt and they fish and

06:39.733 --> 06:41.568
that's how they've done
it for many decades.

06:42.402 --> 06:46.473
More importantly it is
in the middle of nowhere
and I'm hoping these

06:46.473 --> 06:49.709
seas remains somewhat
flat, if not we could
be in for a rough ride.

06:54.481 --> 06:57.484
Is it almost sort of pot
luck to how many boats get
out this time of the year?

06:57.484 --> 07:00.820
CAPTAIN LEWIS: Yeah, I mean
you, you have to be kind
half crazy this time of year.

07:00.820 --> 07:02.088
GORDON: Right.

07:02.088 --> 07:03.390
In the middle of winter,

07:03.390 --> 07:05.558
there's always a threat of
high winds and rough seas.

07:05.558 --> 07:07.193
But so far, so good.

07:07.827 --> 07:10.330
CAPTAIN LEWIS: It can
start blowing and not stop
for four or five days.

07:11.264 --> 07:15.502
GORDON: Wow, I suppose
when you're snowed in you're
embedded but it just reaffirms

07:15.735 --> 07:19.072
how remote and how difficult
in the wilderness it is.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.074
CAPTAIN LEWIS:
Yeah, absolutely.

07:21.074 --> 07:22.409
You gotta have a plan.

07:22.409 --> 07:24.544
GORDON: Yeah.
And a Plan B and a Plan C.

07:24.544 --> 07:26.446
CAPTAIN LEWIS:
Yes, absolutely.

07:26.713 --> 07:29.382
GORDON: Before we go to
Hoonah I'm taking a quick
detour to meet up with a

07:29.382 --> 07:31.584
local forager Lionel
introduced me to.

07:32.786 --> 07:35.956
Of course, this guy
asked me to meet him at a
place called Chimney Rock

07:36.856 --> 07:39.859
because in Alaska this is
how foragers roll, apparently.

07:40.427 --> 07:41.628
Alan?

07:41.628 --> 07:43.163
ALAN: Hey! How's it going?

07:43.163 --> 07:45.365
GORDON: Good, good.
ALAN: Good to see you.
GORDON: Good to see too, bud.

07:45.365 --> 07:46.366
ALAN: Yeah.

07:46.366 --> 07:47.500
GORDON: What an amazing place.

07:47.500 --> 07:49.235
ALAN: Oh, it's
beautiful isn't it?

07:49.235 --> 07:51.104
GORDON: Lionel said it would
be an adventure but he didn't
tell me we were gonna climb.

07:51.504 --> 07:52.505
Bloody hell.

07:52.505 --> 07:54.074
ALAN: He didn't.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.242
We're gonna ascend up
some ropes and go get some
old man's beard at the top

07:56.242 --> 07:57.544
of this cliff right here.

07:57.544 --> 07:58.812
GORDON: Oh (bleep).

07:58.812 --> 08:01.181
ALAN: Make some tea with
it and it's very good.

08:01.181 --> 08:03.683
GORDON: And that's
the only place up there
that houses the old man?

08:03.683 --> 08:06.753
ALAN: That's the only place.

08:07.120 --> 08:10.290
GORDON: If Chef Lionel
had told me I was climbing
a 60 foot cliff I would've

08:10.290 --> 08:11.958
packed a 61 foot ladder.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.794
You're nuts.

08:14.794 --> 08:17.030
ALAN: Nah, this is
just what we do up here
in Alaska you know.

08:18.965 --> 08:20.700
GORDON: (bleep).
First things first.

08:21.334 --> 08:24.237
ALAN: Alright I got a
harness for you, grab this.

08:24.237 --> 08:26.573
Put your left leg in here.

08:27.407 --> 08:28.908
Gotta bring the hot
water for the tea.

08:28.908 --> 08:30.777
GORDON: Yes.

08:33.079 --> 08:35.682
People usually
take weeks to learn a
new climbing technique,

08:36.216 --> 08:37.951
I've had five minutes.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.686
ALAN: So right hand
as high as it'll go.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.221
GORDON: Yeah.

08:41.221 --> 08:45.258
ALAN: Now lift up
your left foot, push
your right arm up.

08:47.160 --> 08:48.495
Yeah, there you go.

08:48.495 --> 08:50.663
Now push up with
your left foot.

08:50.663 --> 08:54.634
Push up and get that right
arm up there, you got it.

08:54.634 --> 08:56.803
GORDON: I'm at
the end of my rope in
more ways than one.

08:57.237 --> 08:58.371
So...

08:58.371 --> 09:02.776
ALAN: Yeah. You got it.

09:04.110 --> 09:05.712
It'd kinda like a
burst of energy.

09:05.712 --> 09:06.846
GORDON: Yes.

09:06.846 --> 09:08.281
ALAN: Explode with
your left foot.

09:08.281 --> 09:09.416
GORDON: Yeah.

09:09.416 --> 09:10.917
ALAN: And keep
your right arm up.

09:10.917 --> 09:13.386
GORDON: (bleep).
My left won't come up.

09:17.524 --> 09:19.059
(bleep).

09:19.392 --> 09:21.194
ALAN: Feel good?

09:21.194 --> 09:23.997
GORDON: Yeah. I think.

09:26.199 --> 09:27.967
ALAN:
Look at where we're at.

09:27.967 --> 09:30.303
Isn't this awesome?

09:30.303 --> 09:32.172
GORDON: There's gotta be an
easier way for a cup of tea.

09:32.172 --> 09:33.473
(bleep).

09:33.473 --> 09:35.275
ALAN: This is the best way.

09:36.409 --> 09:37.444
GORDON: Quick breather
for ten seconds.

09:37.444 --> 09:38.912
ALAN: Yeah.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.947
GORDON: That is a lot
harder than you think.

09:41.181 --> 09:43.116
(bleep).

09:45.318 --> 09:47.253
ALAN: Check this out.

09:53.793 --> 09:55.261
We're almost halfway there.

09:55.261 --> 09:56.763
GORDON: (bleep).

10:05.939 --> 10:07.674
GORDON: Oh my (bleep).

10:07.674 --> 10:09.843
ALAN: I've got an idea,
let's swing over here.

10:09.843 --> 10:11.111
GORDON: Yeah.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.445
ALAN: I wonder if that'll
help a little bit.

10:12.445 --> 10:15.081
GORDON: I'm struggling
up at 60 foot cliff
in Hoonah foraging for a

10:15.081 --> 10:16.950
medicinal herb to
make a hot drink with.

10:20.320 --> 10:23.556
Afternoon tea
clearly requires a lot
more work around here.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.759
ALAN: You're ready to
give it a go again?

10:26.759 --> 10:27.760
GORDON: Yeah.

10:27.760 --> 10:29.496
ALAN: Alright, let's do it.

10:33.399 --> 10:37.837
Aright, so lean back
away from the cliff and you
gotta get over this edge

10:38.438 --> 10:40.740
and we're pretty
much home free.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.949
GORDON: (bleep),
(bleep), (bleep).

10:52.318 --> 10:53.553
ALAN: Look at this!

10:53.553 --> 10:54.621
GORDON: (bleep).

10:54.621 --> 10:55.922
ALAN: We're at the top!

10:55.922 --> 10:57.190
GORDON: (bleep).

10:57.190 --> 10:58.625
ALAN: Whoa!
Give me high five.

10:58.625 --> 11:00.126
GORDON: (bleep).
ALAN: Great!

11:00.126 --> 11:01.461
GORDON: That was amazing.

11:01.461 --> 11:05.098
ALAN: Like one of the
most remote rock pillars
in Southeast Alaska.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.267
Isn't this frickin' awesome?

11:07.267 --> 11:08.535
GORDON: It is incredible.

11:08.535 --> 11:11.137
I mean this is survival
right up here isn't it?

11:11.137 --> 11:12.438
ALAN: Oh, yeah.

11:12.438 --> 11:14.440
GORDON: I mean...
ALAN: It is.
GORDON: I've gone to some...

11:14.440 --> 11:16.376
ALAN: You've gotta be
prepared for anything
coming at you.

11:16.376 --> 11:17.844
Look at this storm
we got rolling in.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.512
GORDON: Yeah.

11:20.680 --> 11:25.485
I was like relaxed because
I honestly thought I was
gonna have to repel down

11:25.485 --> 11:27.987
cause the ascent
was a little bit more
difficult than I thought.

11:29.789 --> 11:32.959
I've never been
a quitter but um, the
adrenalin took over.

11:33.726 --> 11:34.827
ALAN: Good job, man.

11:34.827 --> 11:36.829
GORDON: Amazing. Amazing.
Amazing. Amazing.

11:36.829 --> 11:37.931
ALAN: Yeah.

11:37.931 --> 11:39.866
GORDON: Oh. (bleep)
Look at that over there.

11:39.866 --> 11:40.934
ALAN: Yeah!

11:40.934 --> 11:42.468
GORDON: That's it there,
the old man's beard.

11:42.468 --> 11:43.770
ALAN: Yeah, this is it.

11:43.770 --> 11:45.171
GORDON: It actually
looks like a beard
as well doesn't it?

11:45.171 --> 11:46.372
ALAN: Yeah it does.

11:46.372 --> 11:49.142
GORDON: In terms of,
I mean beautiful.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.744
ALAN: I mean look.
How's it look?

11:51.978 --> 11:53.813
GORDON: Exactly.
We're growing a goatee.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.316
ALAN: Yeah. Just like that.

11:56.316 --> 11:59.552
GORDON: Amazing.
ALAN: Perfect. Alright.
GORDON: (bleep).

12:00.053 --> 12:02.055
ALAN: This tea.
Are you ready or what?

12:02.055 --> 12:04.457
GORDON: How old were you
when you first started
these kind of climbs?

12:05.158 --> 12:06.492
ALAN: Oh, I was like,

12:06.492 --> 12:08.494
I think I was
13 when I first...

12:08.494 --> 12:09.495
GORDON: 13.

12:09.495 --> 12:11.164
ALAN: Tried climbing
for the first time.

12:11.164 --> 12:14.467
I mean it was nothing
gnarly but you know I started
getting in the mountains and

12:14.467 --> 12:15.702
I got hooked.

12:15.702 --> 12:17.270
So here I am.

12:17.270 --> 12:20.373
GORDON: It's amazing.
Cheers for a good job.

12:20.907 --> 12:22.342
ALAN: Cheers.

12:24.444 --> 12:25.945
GORDON: Wow!

12:25.945 --> 12:28.781
So that's a cross
between a sort of bailey
stroke mint with a little

12:28.781 --> 12:30.149
touch of rosemary in there.

12:30.149 --> 12:31.684
Alright, so big
difference there.

12:31.684 --> 12:32.819
ALAN: Kinda tastes
like it huh?

12:32.819 --> 12:34.721
These are spruce
tips right here.

12:34.721 --> 12:37.023
GORDON: Gotcha. Wow, wow.

12:38.891 --> 12:42.595
Locals have been harvesting
these bitter lemony spruce
branch tips for years.

12:43.329 --> 12:44.731
GORDON: That's amazing.

12:44.731 --> 12:45.898
That's amazing, oh my God.

12:45.898 --> 12:48.334
ALAN: Are you about
ready to go down?

12:48.334 --> 12:49.936
GORDON: Yeah.

12:49.936 --> 12:52.071
ALAN: Walk your
way down, okay.

12:52.071 --> 12:54.107
Put your left arm down.

12:54.974 --> 12:58.177
GORDON: I'm now
getting a sense to how
dangerous Alaska is....

12:58.978 --> 13:00.213
ALAN: Awesome.

13:00.213 --> 13:01.948
GORDON: If you don't
know how to survive properly.

13:01.948 --> 13:03.850
Bloody windy.

13:03.850 --> 13:05.518
ALAN: Nice work.

13:05.518 --> 13:08.454
GORDON: If you're
not prepared boy it's
gonna take you down.

13:10.590 --> 13:11.891
ALAN: Woo‐hoo‐hoo!

13:11.891 --> 13:13.559
GORDON: But what
an experience.

13:13.559 --> 13:15.862
You know for someone who
doesn't climb for a living
that was extraordinary.

13:16.062 --> 13:17.096
Cheers for that.

13:17.096 --> 13:18.531
ALAN: Good luck here.

13:18.531 --> 13:20.099
GORDON: (bleep) That's
harder than you think, man.

13:20.099 --> 13:22.468
ALAN: Oh, yeah.
GORDON: Oh, great job.
ALAN: That was awesome.

13:22.902 --> 13:25.204
GORDON: The good news is
that I'm done with climbing.

13:27.440 --> 13:31.110
But the bad news is that
spruce tips and old man's
beard aren't gonna be enough

13:31.110 --> 13:33.079
to satisfy the
fishermen at our feast.

13:35.782 --> 13:38.117
So, after taking the
scenic route I'm in Hoonah,

13:38.618 --> 13:41.788
homeland of the Tlingit
community for over 250 years.

13:44.223 --> 13:47.660
The Tlingit fish and
hunt to survive with seal
a key part of their diet.

13:50.797 --> 13:54.367
But only Alaskan natives
can hunt them which rules
me out because in case

13:54.367 --> 13:56.502
you hadn't noticed
I'm not an Alaskan native.

13:57.503 --> 13:58.504
Good job. Yeah.

13:58.504 --> 13:59.572
CAPTAIN LEWIS:
Thank you sir.

13:59.572 --> 14:01.040
GORDON:
Thanks, bud.
Thank you.

14:01.040 --> 14:03.876
So I'm gonna meet a
tribal elder at his smokehouse

14:03.876 --> 14:06.012
to learn how to prepare
this native staple.

14:09.816 --> 14:11.117
GORDON: Owen, good evening.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.253
GORDON: I'm very well,
thank you.

14:14.253 --> 14:16.255
An absolute
pleasure to see you.
Young lady, how are you?

14:16.255 --> 14:17.490
LIA: Good, how are you?

14:17.490 --> 14:18.725
GORDON: Don't worry,
I've had worse on my hands.

14:18.725 --> 14:20.026
Gordon, good to see you.
And your name is?

14:20.026 --> 14:21.194
LIA: I'm Lia.

14:21.194 --> 14:23.730
GORDON: Lia.
Tlingit elder, Owen,

14:23.730 --> 14:25.398
has been hunting seal
to help feed his community

14:25.398 --> 14:26.999
since he was eight years old.

14:26.999 --> 14:28.868
GORDON: Are they
difficult to catch?

14:33.673 --> 14:35.341
(animal call).

14:38.211 --> 14:39.879
GORDON: Wow, sounds
like my grandad burping!

14:39.879 --> 14:41.080
OWEN: Yeah.

14:41.080 --> 14:42.515
GORDON: And they come
up to the surface?

14:47.186 --> 14:48.688
GORDON: What are you
doing there by way?

14:48.688 --> 14:50.189
LIA: Braiding the intestines.

14:50.189 --> 14:51.657
GORDON: You're braiding
the intestines.

14:51.657 --> 14:54.460
Seriously.
Into like a plaint?

14:54.927 --> 14:57.263
LIA: Yes.
GORDON: May I?

14:57.563 --> 14:59.499
OWEN: Fine, I'm sorry.

14:59.499 --> 15:00.833
GORDON: No thank you.

15:00.833 --> 15:04.103
LIA: You just grab
that, this part here.

15:04.504 --> 15:05.638
GORDON: Wow.

15:05.638 --> 15:06.939
LIA: And then you
pull it back through.

15:06.939 --> 15:08.341
GORDON: I mean that
is a beautiful braid.

15:08.341 --> 15:10.710
And what do you
use intestines for?

15:10.710 --> 15:12.812
OWEN: We'll hang
it in the smoke house
and smoke it through.

15:13.312 --> 15:14.647
GORDON: Wow.

15:14.647 --> 15:16.616
OWEN: And when we're
getting ready to cook
the meat we usually cook

15:16.616 --> 15:18.050
the intestines with it.

15:18.050 --> 15:19.185
GORDON: Wow.

15:19.185 --> 15:20.787
And then taste‐wise,

15:20.787 --> 15:25.258
is it almost like
a, a sort of jerky,
sort of pork texture?

15:25.958 --> 15:27.460
Or is it a lot more strenuous?

15:29.395 --> 15:31.364
GORDON: Yeah.
Amazing, it's a
beautiful knot.

15:31.364 --> 15:32.799
Is that how you
braid your hair?

15:32.799 --> 15:34.967
LIA: No.
GORDON: No. Awesome.

15:35.234 --> 15:37.203
Alright, well I'm
gonna have a little go.

15:37.203 --> 15:38.805
So you got your fingers
in there, right.

15:38.805 --> 15:40.306
LIA: Then you grab this.

15:40.306 --> 15:41.374
GORDON: Grab that bit.

15:41.374 --> 15:42.809
LIA: Then you
pull that through.

15:42.809 --> 15:44.243
GORDON: Pull that
through, right.

15:44.243 --> 15:45.344
LIA: Yes.

15:45.344 --> 15:46.746
GORDON: And then pull
all the way through.

15:46.746 --> 15:48.247
LIA: Yes.
GORDON: Gotcha. Okay.

15:48.247 --> 15:49.649
And so, again.

15:49.649 --> 15:52.418
So, pull that through
and then push down.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.055
That's incredible.

15:56.055 --> 15:58.191
OWEN: That's something
that like we grew
up with I should say.

15:58.458 --> 15:59.625
GORDON: Yeah.
OWEN: And...

15:59.625 --> 16:01.394
GORDON: And a delicacy
beyond belief.

16:01.394 --> 16:03.129
OWEN: That's true.
GORDON: May I?
OWEN: Yes.

16:03.129 --> 16:06.332
GORDON: Mind you there's
a pungent smell coming
from them, isn't there?

16:10.069 --> 16:12.972
After seeing how
creative Owen and Lia are
with the seals intestines

16:12.972 --> 16:15.641
I'm curious to see
what Owen's got going
on in his smokehouse.

16:17.276 --> 16:18.611
So you built this
little smokehouse?

16:18.611 --> 16:20.713
OWEN: Yes I did.
GORDON: Wow.

16:20.713 --> 16:22.114
OWEN: Yeah, this
is seal meat here.

16:22.114 --> 16:25.184
You wanna center
it and hang it on one
of these sticks here.

16:25.718 --> 16:27.019
GORDON: Gotcha.
OWEN: While back.

16:27.019 --> 16:28.354
GORDON:
And what cut is this?

16:28.354 --> 16:29.555
OWEN: The back flippers.

16:29.555 --> 16:30.723
GORDON: Back flipper.

16:30.723 --> 16:31.991
OWEN: Yes.
GORDON: Of course it is.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.326
And long will you hang them?

16:33.326 --> 16:35.862
OWEN: I'll, I'll hang 'em
for six to eight hours.

16:35.862 --> 16:37.363
GORDON: Wow and do you
season it with anything,

16:37.363 --> 16:38.831
is there a rub,
is there a salt, is there?

16:38.831 --> 16:39.899
OWEN: No.

16:39.899 --> 16:41.434
GORDON: Nothing at all?
OWEN: Nothing at all.

16:41.434 --> 16:42.902
GORDON: Amazing.

16:42.902 --> 16:45.271
Just like hanging
my grandma's washing.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.442
And if you thought
intestine braiding was fun,

16:49.442 --> 16:51.210
wait till you see what
they do with the lungs.

16:56.549 --> 16:58.885
GORDON: Stop it.
OWEN: That's right.
GORDON: Blow in the lungs?

17:03.523 --> 17:04.991
(laughs).

17:06.058 --> 17:07.660
GORDON: That is a
big pair of lungs.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.228
OWEN: Yes.

17:09.529 --> 17:10.930
GORDON: Big, big breath?

17:10.930 --> 17:12.431
OWEN: Yes.

17:14.600 --> 17:16.335
GORDON: Just wipe a
little bit of congealed
blood at the top for me.

17:16.335 --> 17:17.370
OWEN: What's that?

17:17.370 --> 17:19.138
GORDON: Could you just
wipe a little, wipe my,

17:19.138 --> 17:21.040
wipe my pipe.

17:21.774 --> 17:24.010
Let's go for D minor.

17:26.913 --> 17:30.383
(exhaling)

17:38.257 --> 17:39.859
GORDON: I'm in
Hoonah, Alaska indulging

17:39.859 --> 17:42.929
in my new hobby of
blowing up seal lungs
do oxidize the meat.

17:46.599 --> 17:47.733
GORDON: Once more.

17:48.668 --> 17:49.802
GORDON: Yes.

17:50.536 --> 17:52.371
GORDON: Gotcha.
Look at the color
of these things.

17:52.738 --> 17:53.873
OWEN: Yes.

17:53.873 --> 17:55.741
GORDON: What are you
laughing at young lady?
Come on.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.645
GORDON: No, no I'll finish off,
I've, I've got this.

17:59.645 --> 18:01.180
My mother would
never forgive me if I

18:01.180 --> 18:04.517
didn't complete a full
pair of seal lungs, ready?

18:08.854 --> 18:10.856
OWEN: Almost, almost.

18:11.624 --> 18:12.658
LIA: Got 'em.

18:12.658 --> 18:14.393
OWEN: Ha‐ha‐ha!
Sweet. You got it.

18:14.393 --> 18:18.764
GORDON: (bleep) Oh,
my Lord, are we happy?

18:19.065 --> 18:20.933
OWEN: Yes.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.636
GORDON: That is incredible.

18:25.905 --> 18:27.173
OWEN: Yes, this.

18:27.173 --> 18:28.240
GORDON: In the middle?

18:28.240 --> 18:29.909
OWEN: Oh, yes, please.

18:31.577 --> 18:33.379
GORDON: Beautiful,
turn the gas up.

18:33.379 --> 18:38.851
Amazing now the
Tlingit community that means
a lot to you and obviously

18:39.418 --> 18:42.221
you're at the helm,
but how far back does it go?

18:42.955 --> 18:44.957
OWEN: Well it goes back
to nine generations.

18:45.558 --> 18:47.560
My father's family now.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.161
GORDON: Wow!

18:49.161 --> 18:52.832
OWEN: My father lived a
good long life, he was 108
years old when he passed.

18:53.366 --> 18:54.900
GORDON: 108?

18:54.900 --> 18:58.304
OWEN: Yes. And his father
was 122 when he passed.

18:59.372 --> 19:01.040
GORDON: 122!

19:01.040 --> 19:02.274
OWEN: Yes, sir.

19:02.274 --> 19:03.776
GORDON: Wow!
That's extraordinary.

19:03.776 --> 19:05.177
OWEN: Yes.

19:05.177 --> 19:06.779
GORDON: And do you think
that was because they
were surviving from the

19:06.779 --> 19:07.980
island and eating...

19:07.980 --> 19:09.782
OWEN: Eating well
from food off the land.

19:09.782 --> 19:11.517
GORDON: Yeah.
That's incredible.

19:11.517 --> 19:13.219
OWEN: I can only hope
to live that long.

19:13.786 --> 19:15.254
GORDON: Wow.

19:18.524 --> 19:20.393
GORDON: I'd love
to taste some.

19:21.761 --> 19:23.462
To me it looks like
a, almost like a stew.

19:23.863 --> 19:25.197
OWEN: Yes.
GORDON: Yeah.

19:25.197 --> 19:27.333
OWEN: Well why don't
you try that first.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.235
GORDON: Thank you. I am
looking forward to this.

19:29.635 --> 19:31.203
Do you mind if I have
a little bit of gravy?

19:32.104 --> 19:34.640
GORDON: Just a little bit,
sorry, it's how chefs are.

19:37.376 --> 19:40.279
So at first with my
fork yeah, it's very tender.

19:40.279 --> 19:42.515
How long has that
been cooking?

19:43.616 --> 19:45.785
GORDON: Stop it, really?

19:48.220 --> 19:52.258
Wow, it's salty,
it's almost a little bit
anchovy, it's quite meaty.

19:52.992 --> 19:54.026
Isn't it?

19:54.026 --> 19:55.995
It is delicious.

19:55.995 --> 19:57.329
Do you mind if I take some?

19:59.231 --> 20:00.499
GORDON: Thank you.

20:01.667 --> 20:04.503
GORDON: Oh, really. Mm.

20:05.604 --> 20:06.906
That's an amazing
treat, thank you.

20:06.906 --> 20:10.443
And if I live to 100,
trust me I've got you
to thank.

20:11.277 --> 20:12.912
Be well.

20:12.912 --> 20:18.417
Hanging up this fatty
meat in that smokehouse
didn't give me that kind of

20:19.051 --> 20:22.555
kickback as if you're
curing meat, pork.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.157
But also when
you start to taste it,

20:25.157 --> 20:28.094
it's got this rich,
fishy, ox tail‐y,

20:28.461 --> 20:31.664
meaty texture with this
really sumptuous gravy.

20:33.966 --> 20:36.469
I think I'll leave inflated
seal lungs off the menu.

20:37.069 --> 20:40.172
but I have a feeling this
seal bacon will be a big
hit with the fishermen.

20:49.715 --> 20:51.851
I still need a main course
and with just two days

20:51.851 --> 20:53.953
until the cook I'm
running out of time.

20:54.253 --> 20:57.456
But fortunately, Alaska
has two things in common
with my native Scotland.

20:58.357 --> 21:01.894
Salmon fishing is plentiful
and the weather is
absolutely bloody freezing.

21:04.463 --> 21:06.799
So it's time to get
out the rod and reel.

21:08.334 --> 21:09.969
CAPTAIN LEWIS:
Nice day though, at
least we can see today.

21:09.969 --> 21:11.437
GORDON: It's beautiful.

21:11.437 --> 21:14.406
Southeast Alaska is famed
for its amazing king salmon.

21:14.840 --> 21:18.277
Josh has been fishing
these waters six days
a week for 15 years.

21:19.378 --> 21:21.914
But he assures me
there's still plenty of
fish left in the sea.

21:23.149 --> 21:25.151
GORDON: So did you
grow up fishing?

21:25.651 --> 21:27.186
JOSH: Oh, yeah, my whole life.

21:27.186 --> 21:28.621
GORDON: What's the
biggest salmon you caught?

21:28.621 --> 21:29.955
JOSH: 56 pounds dressed.

21:29.955 --> 21:31.056
GORDON: Stop it!

21:31.056 --> 21:32.324
When you say "dressed"
what do you mean "dressed"?

21:32.324 --> 21:33.893
JOSH: That's dressed, it
means the gills are taken out,

21:33.893 --> 21:34.927
the guts are taken out.

21:34.927 --> 21:36.862
GORDON: (bleep).

21:37.696 --> 21:39.665
Catching king salmon
is very difficult but

21:39.665 --> 21:41.934
Josh agrees to share
some trade secrets.

21:42.902 --> 21:45.004
JOSH: So I will show you a
couple of baiting techniques.

21:45.604 --> 21:48.641
GORDON: Sure, these are you
own specialized techniques so
did your dad show you this?

21:48.874 --> 21:51.110
JOSH: Yeah, dad showed
me it but dad does it
different than I do.

21:51.544 --> 21:52.878
GORDON: Sure.

21:52.878 --> 21:54.280
JOSH: It's all about
your relationship
with a piece of bait.

21:54.280 --> 21:56.582
GORDON: So if we don't
catch anything I'm gonna
blame your technique.

21:56.582 --> 21:58.551
JOSH: Yeah, sure. Alrighty.

21:58.551 --> 21:59.652
GORDON: Come on.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.187
JOSH: Alright, we'll start
with the threading here.

22:01.187 --> 22:02.855
A firecracker,
it's a red herring.

22:03.455 --> 22:04.890
Have you ever seen
anything like this before?

22:04.890 --> 22:06.325
GORDON: No, not
this technique, no.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.727
No. I'm gonna use it when
I get back to Scotland.

22:08.727 --> 22:10.029
JOSH: Yeah, it might work.

22:10.029 --> 22:11.564
So now the fun begins.

22:11.864 --> 22:12.898
Yeah.

22:12.898 --> 22:14.166
GORDON: So, I'm gonna
thread that through.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.467
JOSH: When you
put it through there
you wanna be careful,

22:15.467 --> 22:16.836
the hooks are sharp.

22:16.836 --> 22:18.504
GORDON: Yes...

22:18.504 --> 22:21.373
JOSH: You just wanna go
nice and slow and bring her
through, see nice and easy,

22:22.374 --> 22:23.776
nice and easy.

22:23.776 --> 22:25.544
Look at that.

22:25.544 --> 22:27.913
Like a pro.

22:29.648 --> 22:30.983
GORDON: It's a
beautiful technique.

22:30.983 --> 22:33.185
JOSH: Alrighty.

22:33.185 --> 22:36.021
You wanna
grab that rod board,

22:36.021 --> 22:37.656
I'll stop
you when she's good.

22:37.656 --> 22:39.191
A little bit more.

22:39.191 --> 22:40.693
That's good.

22:40.693 --> 22:43.829
I'm gonna set that way
back and see if something
might come screaming.

22:48.734 --> 22:49.902
GORDON: Come on baby.

22:49.902 --> 22:51.003
JOSH: Come on.

22:51.003 --> 22:52.204
GORDON: I need that fish.

22:52.204 --> 22:53.272
Josh, please.

22:53.272 --> 22:55.274
JOSH: I know.
GORDON: Come on.

22:55.507 --> 22:57.476
♪ Wild king,
you make my rod sing ♪

22:58.143 --> 23:01.747
♪ Wild king,
you make my rod sing ♪♪

23:07.286 --> 23:11.490
After two hours of this
the only thing on the line
is my fishing reputation.

23:12.524 --> 23:16.262
So, we go inside to warm
up and Josh tells me what
bears do in the woods.

23:17.129 --> 23:18.864
No, no, no not that.

23:18.864 --> 23:20.766
I'm fascinated
by the numbers of bears,

23:20.766 --> 23:22.434
you had an encounter
with one recently.

23:22.434 --> 23:23.936
JOSH: Yes, I did actually.

23:23.936 --> 23:27.406
A couple of years back
I was mauled by a bear
on top of a mountain while

23:27.406 --> 23:29.508
deer hunting
in Hoonah, Alaska.

23:30.242 --> 23:31.677
GORDON:
(bleep). What happened?

23:31.677 --> 23:33.879
JOSH: Well we had
been walking through
some brushy area,

23:33.879 --> 23:36.548
a sow came
out and attacked me.

23:36.882 --> 23:40.552
It ripped my head apart,
my leg, my back, my side.

23:41.353 --> 23:46.425
Mauled me up pretty good
and luckily my friend I had
hunting with me was able to

23:46.425 --> 23:48.527
shoot her off me and
I was able to survive.

23:49.261 --> 23:50.362
GORDON: You're
lucky to be alive.

23:50.362 --> 23:52.031
JOSH: It's survival
of the fittest,

23:52.031 --> 23:53.899
there's no room
for the weak out here.

23:53.899 --> 23:55.668
GORDON: No.

23:55.901 --> 23:58.137
Eventually we get our
hands on a king salmon.

23:58.137 --> 24:00.272
Unfortunately, it was one
that Josh caught yesterday.

24:00.940 --> 24:05.444
JOSH: All right, so here
is a genuine Alaskan
winter king salmon.

24:06.178 --> 24:07.880
GORDON: Oh wow,
that's a beauty.

24:08.213 --> 24:10.983
Look at that, man.

24:12.484 --> 24:14.720
JOSH: And you can
smell the oil.

24:15.254 --> 24:17.389
GORDON: Wow. Look at that.

24:17.389 --> 24:19.325
JOSH: A distinctive smell.
GORDON: That's beautiful.

24:19.325 --> 24:21.093
Shall I filet it, then?

24:21.093 --> 24:22.895
JOSH: Yes, sure,
that would be great.

24:22.895 --> 24:24.763
GORDON: I can't wait
to get a taste of this.

24:24.763 --> 24:28.634
At least I know my
cooking skills are way
better than my fishing.

24:29.735 --> 24:30.836
My God.

24:30.836 --> 24:33.172
I'm going to take
the scales off first.

24:33.605 --> 24:35.641
Also, when you take
the scales off it starts

24:35.641 --> 24:38.010
to release the oil
from that salmon first.

24:38.978 --> 24:41.213
JOSH: It looks like you've
done this before a few times.

24:41.613 --> 24:42.715
GORDON: Yeah.

24:42.715 --> 24:44.450
God, thousands of times.

24:44.450 --> 24:46.118
Man, it cuts like butter.

24:46.118 --> 24:48.821
Josh, the nice thing about
this is that none of that
stuff goes to waste, right?

24:48.821 --> 24:50.055
JOSH: None of it.

24:50.055 --> 24:53.192
GORDON: So back in the UK an
Alaskan king salmon like that,

24:53.192 --> 24:55.594
we'd be buying
them from you close to

24:55.594 --> 24:57.763
500 or £600 a fish.

24:58.230 --> 24:59.431
JOSH: Wow.

24:59.431 --> 25:02.401
GORDON: Selling them between
80 and £90 per portion.

25:02.835 --> 25:03.869
JOSH: Wow.

25:03.869 --> 25:05.170
GORDON: It's that rare.

25:05.170 --> 25:07.106
I want to hear that
noise, that crackling now.

25:07.106 --> 25:10.009
JOSH: Oh yeah.
GORDON: In. And see that.

25:12.311 --> 25:14.680
And I'll finish that with
a little touch of lemon.

25:14.913 --> 25:18.117
JOSH: Look at that sizzle,
oh my God. Amazing.

25:18.450 --> 25:21.987
GORDON: I've got the best
fisherman in Alaska on a boat,

25:23.055 --> 25:25.290
so who better to cook for?

25:25.557 --> 25:26.592
JOSH: Look at that.

25:26.592 --> 25:28.727
Oh my gosh, that
smells so good.

25:28.727 --> 25:30.396
GORDON: Guys, jump in.
Help yourself, please.

25:30.396 --> 25:31.663
JOSH: All right‐y.

25:31.663 --> 25:33.599
GORDON: Look at that,
just the texture.

25:34.566 --> 25:36.535
JOSH: It tastes even better.

25:37.069 --> 25:40.172
Oh man, it just
melts in your mouth.

25:41.306 --> 25:43.275
GORDON: We may not have
caught one this morning,

25:43.275 --> 25:46.812
but what I do need
is for you to stay out here

25:46.812 --> 25:48.080
and catch one for me.

25:48.080 --> 25:49.715
JOSH: I will.
GORDON: Do you mind?
JOSH: Most certainly.

25:49.715 --> 25:50.916
It's my promise.

25:50.916 --> 25:52.918
GORDON: I've got a big cook
at the end of the week.

25:52.918 --> 25:54.887
But that needs to
be the centerpiece.

25:56.588 --> 26:01.860
For me, sampling
that magical Alaskan white
salmon was just incredible.

26:02.795 --> 26:05.597
So fingers cross Josh
is not going to come
back empty handed.

26:14.773 --> 26:18.811
I'm starting to understand
how hard is to find food
during the Alaskan winter.

26:19.244 --> 26:21.580
It really is survival
of the fittest out here.

26:24.249 --> 26:26.919
But after a hard day's fishing
yesterday I need a drink.

26:28.187 --> 26:31.723
So I'm going to break the ice
with a woman who is turning
the local glaciers into

26:31.723 --> 26:33.225
somewhat of a delicacy.

26:33.892 --> 26:35.761
Michelle, good morning.
May I come aboard, madam?

26:35.761 --> 26:37.396
MICHELLE: Yes, you may.
GORDON: Thank you.

26:37.663 --> 26:39.465
Oh man.

26:41.500 --> 26:44.136
It's a 90‐minute ride
to the Tracy Arm Fjord.

26:46.105 --> 26:49.641
Michelle is going to
show me how to harvest free
floating icebergs to turn

26:49.641 --> 26:51.643
into pristine ice cubes.

26:52.377 --> 26:53.645
I'm a big fan of cocktails.

26:53.645 --> 26:56.682
But what's going
to be the significant
difference with the ice

26:56.682 --> 26:57.950
coming from the glacier?

26:57.950 --> 26:59.651
MICHELLE: When you
have this type of ice,

26:59.651 --> 27:02.421
not only are you having
the best ice in the world,

27:02.421 --> 27:05.357
but you're having
the whole experience
of Alaska in a glass.

27:06.592 --> 27:10.429
GORDON: But it soon became
apparent that this particular
Alaskan experience wasn't

27:10.429 --> 27:12.397
going to be
confined to that glass,

27:12.831 --> 27:15.033
as we hit some
seriously rough seas.

27:15.033 --> 27:16.668
MAN: Where are
we going, Gordon?

27:17.169 --> 27:19.738
GORDON: We're going to
the (bleep), we're going...

27:20.906 --> 27:23.575
It feels like we're
going (bleep) under.

27:31.750 --> 27:33.018
GORDON: After a rough voyage,

27:33.018 --> 27:35.454
we've arrived at the end
of the Tracy Arm Fjord

27:35.454 --> 27:37.456
to search for glacial ice.

27:39.057 --> 27:40.559
MICHELLE: Oh my God,
it's so gorgeous.

27:41.894 --> 27:43.262
GORDON: It's beautiful.

27:43.262 --> 27:45.430
So we're looking for
what size of ice cube?

27:45.697 --> 27:47.866
MICHELLE: So what we want
to look for is something
that's very rounded.

27:47.866 --> 27:49.134
GORDON: Right, what
about that one?

27:49.134 --> 27:50.469
That's a...

27:50.469 --> 27:52.004
MICHELLE: No, Gordon,
I don't think that
one's going to work.

27:52.004 --> 27:53.505
That's like your
own private island.

27:53.505 --> 27:54.840
GORDON: Wow, look
at that thing.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.808
JOSH: Let's try this
one here to the left.

27:56.808 --> 27:58.744
The white one at 11:00.

28:00.946 --> 28:03.815
GORDON: 10,000
years in the making,
these glaciers produce the

28:03.815 --> 28:05.450
purest ice imaginable.

28:06.752 --> 28:08.253
MICHELLE: I like that one.

28:08.253 --> 28:10.022
GORDON: Perfect for cocktails.

28:11.156 --> 28:13.125
So, the secret behind this is?

28:13.125 --> 28:14.893
MICHELLE: Screwing.

28:14.893 --> 28:18.030
GORDON: Screwing these
into the big block?

28:18.564 --> 28:20.299
MICHELLE: Yes.

28:20.299 --> 28:22.834
And then after that we're
going to hook it up and we're
going to hoist it on board.

28:23.101 --> 28:24.736
GORDON: Got you.

28:24.736 --> 28:26.939
This is the most work
I've ever done for a (bleep)
ice cube in my entire life.

28:27.940 --> 28:30.075
I hope this is going to
make the best cocktail.

28:30.075 --> 28:31.710
MICHELLE: It's going to be
fabulous, just trust me.

28:31.710 --> 28:32.844
GORDON: Right. You ready?

28:32.844 --> 28:34.846
MICHELLE: Yes.
Okay, start screwing.

28:36.782 --> 28:40.152
We're going to hook
it up to a D ring, and if
it's not all the way in it's

28:40.152 --> 28:41.787
going to crack the ice.

28:41.787 --> 28:44.690
You have to kind of be like
over the water, you know,
so you're on top of it.

28:45.524 --> 28:46.792
GORDON: (bleep).

28:46.792 --> 28:48.961
MICHELLE: Let's just make
sure they're really down deep.

28:48.961 --> 28:50.062
GORDON: Are you
kidding me, Michelle?

28:50.062 --> 28:51.263
They can't get any
further in there.

28:51.263 --> 28:52.464
MICHELLE: Okay,
let's just test.

28:52.464 --> 28:53.765
GORDON: Holy (bleep) my
fingers are (bleep) freezing.

28:53.765 --> 28:55.400
MICHELLE: See, look,
yours is coming out.

28:55.400 --> 28:56.435
GORDON: Mine's coming out?

28:56.435 --> 28:58.170
MICHELLE: Yeah, you've
got to get that in deeper.

28:58.170 --> 28:59.338
GORDON: Deeper?

28:59.338 --> 29:00.772
MICHELLE: Yeah, you're
not all the way in.

29:00.772 --> 29:03.208
When we pull
that up on the winch
it's going to crack.

29:05.544 --> 29:07.913
GORDON: (bleep).
MICHELLE: Perfect.

29:16.655 --> 29:18.724
GORDON: Stop,
stop, stop. Good job.

29:21.059 --> 29:22.594
MICHELLE: That was fun.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.429
GORDON: Amazing.

29:24.630 --> 29:25.931
So, you take that
outer layer off.

29:25.931 --> 29:27.966
MICHELLE:
And then you get to some
of those ice diamonds.

29:27.966 --> 29:29.768
GORDON: Look at this.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.036
MICHELLE: Oh, that's gorgeous.

29:31.036 --> 29:32.237
GORDON: That is so beautiful.

29:32.237 --> 29:33.372
MICHELLE: Right?

29:33.372 --> 29:34.473
GORDON: Look at
that formation.

29:34.473 --> 29:35.741
MICHELLE: Shall we
put that in a glass?

29:35.741 --> 29:36.908
GORDON: Shall we?

29:36.908 --> 29:37.909
MICHELLE: Drop it in there.

29:37.909 --> 29:39.444
GORDON: Wow.

29:39.444 --> 29:41.880
MICHELLE: Oh, I like
how that, and what do you
think for a little scotch?

29:42.147 --> 29:44.349
It's a good one.

29:45.083 --> 29:47.352
And now we need a
little vermouth.

29:55.294 --> 29:57.529
GORDON: I feel like one of
the luckiest mixologists
anywhere on the planet.

29:59.731 --> 30:01.233
Oh my lord, look at that.

30:01.233 --> 30:02.934
Look at the colors.

30:03.168 --> 30:04.202
MICHELLE: I think
we've earned it.

30:04.202 --> 30:05.504
GORDON: Cheers, good health.

30:05.504 --> 30:06.805
MICHELLE: Cheers.

30:06.805 --> 30:09.341
GORDON: Look at that.
What an ice cube. Oh my lord.

30:13.111 --> 30:15.681
(muffled coughing)

30:16.515 --> 30:18.350
Holy (bleep), that's strong.

30:18.350 --> 30:20.052
MICHELLE: I think
it's 110 proof.

30:20.052 --> 30:23.021
GORDON: Amazing.
MICHELLE: Cheers.
GORDON: Well done.

30:23.355 --> 30:26.825
I have bars, but I've
never ever touched an ice
cube that's that perfect.

30:27.426 --> 30:31.129
And it just tasted so
clean and fresh and slightly
effervescent in the way that

30:31.129 --> 30:36.468
it was almost lightly
sort of, um,

30:37.736 --> 30:40.372
carbonated.

30:40.372 --> 30:42.341
And a great way, I think,

30:42.341 --> 30:45.110
to toast the beginning of
this incredible cook with an

30:45.110 --> 30:49.548
amazing cocktail laced
with glacier ice cubes.

30:58.523 --> 31:02.327
There's only one day
until the cook and I still
don't have a main course.

31:02.594 --> 31:04.863
Josh hasn't caught
a salmon yet.

31:04.863 --> 31:09.067
But I need a meat dish, so
I've enlisted the help of
a local hunter who has been

31:09.067 --> 31:11.436
shooting game for
over 40 years.

31:13.939 --> 31:17.342
GORDON: Now I have no luck
with this Alaskan king salmon,

31:17.342 --> 31:20.178
fingers crossed
I'll catch a grouse.

31:22.981 --> 31:24.583
Kenny, how are you, sir?

31:24.583 --> 31:25.984
KENNY: There you are.

31:25.984 --> 31:27.219
GORDON: Pleasure
meeting you, man.

31:27.219 --> 31:28.520
KENNY: Very good to see you.

31:28.520 --> 31:29.588
GORDON: You good?

31:29.588 --> 31:31.089
KENNY: We're good.

31:31.089 --> 31:33.792
GORDON: I've shot
pheasants, but I've never
ever taken down a grouse.

31:33.792 --> 31:35.193
What's the secret?

31:35.193 --> 31:38.497
KENNY: They're going
to be very, very still
and very hard to see,

31:38.497 --> 31:40.399
so you'll be shooting

31:40.399 --> 31:43.769
upward likely,
hold slightly low.

31:43.769 --> 31:45.203
GORDON: Hold low.

31:45.203 --> 31:48.106
KENNY: I've brought you a
real good sporters 12‐gauge,
to load it.

31:48.373 --> 31:53.278
GORDON:
Yeah. Safety on.
Finger off.

31:54.212 --> 31:56.481
Up into the shoulder,
firm, that goes up.

31:57.149 --> 31:59.217
And then in the,
beautiful gun.

31:59.217 --> 32:01.286
Now talking about
beauties, what's his name?

32:01.286 --> 32:04.322
KENNY: This is my
very good friend Ash.

32:04.856 --> 32:07.159
GORDON: Ash, hey.

32:07.159 --> 32:09.861
Hopefully we are in for a
chance with a grouse, right?

32:10.162 --> 32:11.563
KENNY: We'll give
it our very best.

32:11.563 --> 32:14.833
In the evening,
that setting here for us,

32:14.833 --> 32:18.003
they like to roost and they
like to call in the family.

32:18.804 --> 32:21.673
And ironically in the
morning they don't want
any part of their buddies.

32:21.673 --> 32:23.842
GORDON: You talk about
grouse like an ex‐girlfriend.

32:23.842 --> 32:26.311
KENNY: I've messed
with them as much.

32:26.311 --> 32:28.613
GORDON: After you, sir.

32:28.847 --> 32:30.816
KENNY: Here we go.

32:33.952 --> 32:35.153
Go.

32:36.688 --> 32:39.024
GORDON: In Scotland,
sometimes the grouse lay low,

32:39.024 --> 32:41.259
but are we looking here in
the trees or on the ground?

32:41.726 --> 32:43.595
KENNY: They'll be
very high in a tree.

32:43.595 --> 32:44.830
GORDON: Got you.

32:44.830 --> 32:48.033
KENNY: Right,
and they might move to
investigate who we are.

32:50.235 --> 32:55.307
If you see so
much as a branch wiggle,
watch it very close.

32:56.007 --> 32:58.143
They're very camouflaged
and hard to see.

32:58.510 --> 33:00.111
GORDON: Wow.

33:00.111 --> 33:02.180
I've just spotted some
spruce tips from an old
man's beard here as well.

33:02.180 --> 33:03.515
KENNY: Yes.

33:03.515 --> 33:05.417
GORDON: So I climbed
up that (bleep) rock
for old man's beard,

33:05.417 --> 33:06.852
because he said it's the
only place it's there.

33:06.852 --> 33:07.986
And it's all here
on the ground.

33:07.986 --> 33:09.454
KENNY: Look, look.

33:09.454 --> 33:12.257
GORDON: Hey old man's
beard, there's a big
(bleep) beard over there.

33:12.257 --> 33:14.426
Honestly, it's everywhere.

33:14.693 --> 33:17.762
Lionel had me scale a
60‐foot cliff in Hoonah
to pick this stuff.

33:18.763 --> 33:22.334
Clearly his warped idea
of welcoming me to Alaska.

33:23.502 --> 33:26.338
Terrifyingly,
we aren't the only ones
on the hunt for dinner.

33:27.973 --> 33:29.574
KENNY: Small moose tracks.

33:29.574 --> 33:30.775
GORDON: That's a small moose?

33:30.775 --> 33:32.143
They've got bigger
feet than me.

33:32.143 --> 33:33.378
KENNY:
They're a large critter.

33:33.378 --> 33:34.479
GORDON: How big
are the moose here?

33:34.479 --> 33:37.082
KENNY: They can be
1200 to 1500 pounds.

33:37.082 --> 33:38.717
GORDON: (bleep).

33:38.717 --> 33:40.018
What do you
do if we see one?

33:40.018 --> 33:41.653
KENNY: We'll just
hope it runs away.

33:41.653 --> 33:42.921
GORDON: But if it
runs towards us?

33:42.921 --> 33:44.222
KENNY: Well.

33:44.222 --> 33:45.657
GORDON: It's going
to charge us.

33:45.657 --> 33:48.660
KENNY: I can run
faster than you.

33:48.660 --> 33:51.596
GORDON: (bleep).

33:59.571 --> 34:01.473
KENNY:
Back, kinda close to that
tree.

34:01.473 --> 34:03.775
GORDON: Yes.

34:04.976 --> 34:08.079
Time for my first
lesson in the Alaskan
art of grouse hunting.

34:10.949 --> 34:15.921
(animal call).

34:18.256 --> 34:20.859
KENNY:
If it flies on the other
side of these little trees,

34:20.859 --> 34:24.863
just shoot it like those
trees aren't eve there.

34:25.163 --> 34:28.099
(animal call).

34:51.890 --> 34:53.825
GORDON: In an effort
to lure the grouse to us,

34:53.825 --> 34:55.994
Kenny displays more of his
impressive repertoire.

34:58.029 --> 35:04.002
(chest thumping)

35:23.388 --> 35:26.391
GORDON: That would have
been a good shot had it been
a grouse and not a branch.

35:28.360 --> 35:31.663
Kenny is unique and
that guy lives to hunt.

35:32.998 --> 35:38.570
However, they didn't come
down to roost and that's what
happens on these islands.

35:39.104 --> 35:41.606
You can't give up.

35:42.641 --> 35:46.411
But with no meat
and no fish I might have
to give up if Josh doesn't

35:46.411 --> 35:48.446
come through with that
salmon he promised me

35:48.446 --> 35:50.281
for tomorrow's big cook.

35:54.252 --> 35:57.355
During my week in
Alaska I've excelled at
not catching hypothermia,

35:57.989 --> 35:59.691
fish or game.

35:59.691 --> 36:02.460
But now it's time
to meet Chef Lionel
to prepare our feast.

36:03.595 --> 36:06.131
Hopefully I'll have more
success in the kitchen.

36:08.667 --> 36:09.701
Lionel!

36:09.701 --> 36:11.202
LIONEL: Gordon!
Hey, you're alive!

36:11.202 --> 36:13.171
GORDON: I made it, bud.
LIONEL: Oh, how was it?

36:13.171 --> 36:14.773
GORDON: Oh my God.
LIONEL: How was Hoonah?

36:14.773 --> 36:16.141
GORDON: Crazy.
No salmon yet.

36:16.141 --> 36:18.877
Apparently, Josh
said he's on his way.
But what an experience.

36:18.877 --> 36:20.111
LIONEL: Yeah,
what did you learn?

36:20.111 --> 36:22.080
GORDON: I scaled
a chimney rock,

36:22.080 --> 36:24.683
that was windy and
waving, crumbling as well.

36:24.983 --> 36:26.951
The most amazing glacier ice.

36:26.951 --> 36:31.322
And then, you know,
on this incredible hunt
for grouse, salmon.

36:32.057 --> 36:36.194
And then got to meet Owen
from the Clinket community
who literally gave

36:36.194 --> 36:38.630
us this sort of
A to Z of a seal.

36:38.997 --> 36:41.299
I'm not too sure
if that's going to play
in my restaurant in London,

36:41.299 --> 36:43.301
but you never know.

36:43.802 --> 36:47.305
Fingers crossed that
salmon arrives soon because
it's freezing out here and

36:47.305 --> 36:49.474
the guests will be
arriving any minute.

36:51.643 --> 36:54.212
Everyone keeps
telling me that Alaska
is all about survival.

36:54.846 --> 36:57.015
I just hope I can make
it through this cook.

37:05.790 --> 37:08.126
GORDON: I spent a week
wrapping my head around
the bounty of food that

37:08.126 --> 37:10.695
Alaska has to offer.

37:10.695 --> 37:12.731
Get that pestle and mortar in.

37:12.731 --> 37:16.367
Now it's time to
test my skills and prepare
a meal that compliments

37:16.367 --> 37:18.269
this rugged terrain.

37:19.270 --> 37:20.472
JOSH: Hey Gordon,
how you doing?

37:20.472 --> 37:21.773
Good to see you.

37:21.773 --> 37:23.241
GORDON: Am I happy to see you.

37:23.241 --> 37:26.077
JOSH: Yeah, I brought
you the king that
you have so desired.

37:26.511 --> 37:27.779
GORDON: Look at that beauty.

37:27.779 --> 37:30.482
Thank God Josh came
through with that salmon.

37:32.550 --> 37:36.621
King salmon had to
be the main staple for this
cook because when we get

37:36.621 --> 37:38.857
our hands on those back in
Europe it's a prize asset.

37:40.825 --> 37:43.361
I'm serving this incredible
wild salmon three ways.

37:43.795 --> 37:47.065
Right, I'm going
to cut them into the
most amazing portions.

37:47.332 --> 37:50.502
It's hours old, you know,
it's good enough to eat
raw right there and then.

37:50.502 --> 37:53.071
And look at that belly
on there, my God.

37:53.838 --> 37:55.907
LIONEL: Wow, that's some
beautiful king you got there.

37:55.907 --> 37:57.208
GORDON:
It's amazing, honestly.

37:57.208 --> 37:58.643
Thank goodness for Josh.

37:58.643 --> 37:59.711
But look at that.

37:59.711 --> 38:02.147
LIONEL: Look at that,
that's beautiful.

38:02.380 --> 38:03.982
GORDON: My first
dish is gravlax.

38:03.982 --> 38:07.352
I'm making a marinade
of spruce tips, juniper
berries and gin.

38:09.187 --> 38:11.556
I'm actually going to
cure that in the snow.

38:11.556 --> 38:12.957
Who needs a fridge
in this temperature?

38:12.957 --> 38:14.559
LIONEL: Well, no,
that's pretty ballsy.

38:14.559 --> 38:16.628
GORDON: Yeah.

38:18.329 --> 38:20.098
Lionel makes a start
on his first dish.

38:20.765 --> 38:22.967
A traditional seafood chowder.

38:22.967 --> 38:25.503
LIONEL: Really
beautiful spot prawns.

38:25.503 --> 38:27.572
Just peel them
down to the tail.

38:28.406 --> 38:31.476
GORDON: I may have
agreed to cook outside
in brave Alaskan spirit,

38:31.976 --> 38:33.778
but that doesn't mean
I have to like it.

38:34.412 --> 38:35.413
Christ.

38:35.413 --> 38:36.447
LIONEL: Oh, it's not too bad.

38:36.447 --> 38:38.082
GORDON: That's not too bad?
Oh my God.

38:38.082 --> 38:39.717
LIONEL: Not too bad.
You'll be fine.

38:39.717 --> 38:41.486
GORDON: I'm going to
have to keep on coming back
in here to defrost my fingers

38:41.486 --> 38:43.054
so I can feel them again,
you know that.

38:44.689 --> 38:46.624
Lionel continues
preparing his chowder,

38:46.925 --> 38:48.059
adding the halibut cheeks,

38:48.059 --> 38:50.061
an octopus and searing
them in pork fat.

38:50.595 --> 38:53.131
As I prepare the
cure for my gravlax.

38:54.465 --> 38:56.935
GORDON: So I made
this really nice paste,

38:56.935 --> 39:00.538
season it with
salt and sugar.

39:02.907 --> 39:05.343
Then Lionel heats up
his homemade fish stock.

39:05.343 --> 39:09.414
And my boozy
marinade is ready to
layer onto the salmon.

39:10.815 --> 39:13.151
I'm just going to
cover that on there.

39:13.785 --> 39:19.457
I've got that really nice,
sort of wild mountainy
flavor in there.

39:20.992 --> 39:23.161
One perk to cooking
alfresco, this.

39:23.928 --> 39:26.631
Stashing the salmon in the
snow for an hour to chill.

39:31.169 --> 39:32.804
(bleep).

39:33.738 --> 39:36.541
For Lionel's second
dish he's smoking black
cod in the smoke house,

39:37.475 --> 39:39.444
for a harvest board
of Alaskan treats.

39:41.613 --> 39:44.382
Smart, smart. Nice.

39:44.916 --> 39:47.252
So, I put my salmon
belly on the bottom.

39:47.518 --> 39:50.922
And for my second
dish I'll be smoking
the salmon belly to layer

39:50.922 --> 39:52.624
onto my pumpernickel toast.

39:57.428 --> 39:58.796
Unimpressed with my toast,

39:58.796 --> 40:01.165
Lionel is now whipping
up a homemade loaf to

40:01.165 --> 40:02.667
go with his seafood stew.

40:03.534 --> 40:05.637
LIONEL: So this is about
ready to rock and roll.

40:05.637 --> 40:07.505
I just wanted to show you,
I'm going to go ahead and

40:07.505 --> 40:09.841
shape it and
then put it in the...

40:09.841 --> 40:11.776
GORDON: So you're going to
bake the bread in open fire?

40:11.776 --> 40:12.977
LIONEL: Yes.

40:12.977 --> 40:14.445
GORDON: Amazing.
And will it be as crusty?

40:14.445 --> 40:15.847
LIONEL: It will
be really crusty.

40:15.847 --> 40:18.149
GORDON: His loaf may be
delicious, but I've got
the perfect ingredient

40:18.149 --> 40:20.618
guaranteed to get the
Alaskan seal of approval.

40:21.753 --> 40:24.322
Right, I'm going
to toast my bread now.

40:24.322 --> 40:27.992
So I'm going
to literally get this
pumpernickel bread and

40:28.726 --> 40:30.295
I've got some
of that seal fat.

40:30.295 --> 40:31.629
LIONEL: Oh, exciting.

40:31.629 --> 40:33.331
GORDON: So I'm going to
grill that on top of there.

40:33.331 --> 40:35.133
It's lightly smoked
as well, by the way.

40:37.302 --> 40:41.139
Whilst Lionel checks
the seasoning of his stew,

40:41.673 --> 40:43.574
I'm making a
spread for the toast

40:43.574 --> 40:45.677
out of horse radish
and crème fraiche.

40:47.045 --> 40:49.113
I'm using some of that
blood orange as well, okay?

40:49.113 --> 40:50.882
LIONEL: Do you need
help with anything?

40:50.882 --> 40:52.850
GORDON: No, you seem
sort of calm and collected,

40:52.850 --> 40:54.085
I'm the one running behind.

40:54.085 --> 40:55.453
But we're getting there.

40:55.453 --> 40:56.454
How's that bread?

40:56.454 --> 40:58.589
LIONEL: Oh.
Let's check it out.

40:58.589 --> 40:59.958
GORDON: Oh wow,
look at that.

40:59.958 --> 41:01.192
That is incredible.

41:01.192 --> 41:02.460
You have got that crust
on there, haven't you?

41:02.460 --> 41:04.162
LIONEL: Nice and hot as well.

41:04.162 --> 41:05.196
GORDON: That is amazing.

41:05.196 --> 41:06.798
LIONEL: Nice.

41:06.798 --> 41:09.067
GORDON: I'm now cooking
my final dish, and yep,

41:09.067 --> 41:10.268
you've guessed it,

41:10.268 --> 41:12.470
salmon again in
a beurre blanc sauce,

41:12.470 --> 41:15.106
served with potatoes,
cooked with Owen's seal bacon.

41:17.976 --> 41:20.912
So I've got some of this
seal bacon from Owen.

41:21.579 --> 41:22.981
What do you think?

41:22.981 --> 41:24.482
LIONEL: That smells
really good, Gordon.

41:24.482 --> 41:26.384
GORDON: Does it?

41:26.384 --> 41:27.552
LIONEL: Thanks for
being out here.

41:27.552 --> 41:28.720
GORDON:
You're welcome. Honestly.

41:28.720 --> 41:30.688
LIONEL: I know you're
freezing your ass off.

41:30.688 --> 41:33.524
GORDON: I have frozen
my ass off (bleep)
week man, oh my God.

41:33.524 --> 41:35.326
LIONEL: Are you cold?
Let me, here, here.

41:35.326 --> 41:36.661
GORDON: No, no,
honestly, I'm fine!

41:36.661 --> 41:37.962
LIONEL: I wore my
favorite shirt for you.

41:37.962 --> 41:39.263
GORDON: Trust me,
no, no, no, honestly.

41:39.263 --> 41:40.365
I'll get there. Stop it!

41:40.365 --> 41:41.532
LIONEL: I'm serious.

41:41.532 --> 41:42.734
GORDON: Honestly,
my mum's watching.

41:42.734 --> 41:44.035
LIONEL: No,
come on, here, here.

41:44.035 --> 41:45.403
GORDON: Honestly,
I'll be fine.

41:45.403 --> 41:47.105
LIONEL: It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

41:47.105 --> 41:49.107
GORDON: I'm toughening up.

41:49.574 --> 41:51.576
LIONEL: Okay, I'm
taking it back because
it's (bleep) cold.

41:51.576 --> 41:52.944
GORDON: It is
(bleep) freezing.

41:52.944 --> 41:54.779
Behave yourself!

41:57.715 --> 41:59.650
Delicious.

42:01.819 --> 42:03.321
LIONEL: Oh hey,
the guests are here!

42:03.321 --> 42:04.756
GORDON: What?
LIONEL: Hey guys!

42:04.756 --> 42:06.357
GORDON: Oh no, seriously?

42:06.357 --> 42:07.959
I'm out of time.

42:07.959 --> 42:09.193
LIONEL: How's everyone doing?

42:09.193 --> 42:11.029
GORDON: Damn.

42:11.029 --> 42:13.431
So, I need to distract
the fishermen the
only way I know how.

42:14.866 --> 42:16.501
Alcohol.

42:16.501 --> 42:17.702
GORDON: Let me
get them a drink.

42:17.702 --> 42:19.637
Damn.

42:21.105 --> 42:22.173
LIONEL: Can I help
you with anything?

42:22.173 --> 42:23.641
GORDON: No, honestly
I'll be fine.

42:23.641 --> 42:24.809
LIONEL: All right.

42:24.809 --> 42:26.611
GORDON: So, to kick
off a meal like that and

42:26.611 --> 42:27.912
to celebrate with
an incredible gin,

42:27.912 --> 42:30.782
local gin with those
ice cubes harvested
from that glacier,

42:30.782 --> 42:35.153
it's the most
perfect but simplest
cocktail on that planet.

42:35.720 --> 42:37.055
Hello.

42:37.055 --> 42:38.222
WOMAN: Hello.

42:38.222 --> 42:41.125
GORDON: A little gin and
tonic, help yourself please.

42:41.359 --> 42:42.393
MAN: Oh wow.

42:42.393 --> 42:43.661
GORDON: Gentlemen.

42:43.661 --> 42:44.796
Cheers, by the way.

42:44.796 --> 42:46.564
EVERYONE: Cheers!

42:46.831 --> 42:49.400
GORDON: Time to plate
up my salmon dishes.

42:50.068 --> 42:56.374
Gravlax with honey mustard
sauce, smoked belly on
pumpernickel toast, grilled

42:56.674 --> 43:01.379
salmon served with spruce tip
beurre blanc, and potatoes
cooked with Owen's seal fat.

43:03.981 --> 43:09.487
Up against Lionel's
harvest board of smoked
meats and his fire cooked

43:09.921 --> 43:12.056
loaf with seafood stew.

43:12.790 --> 43:14.492
Thank you.

43:14.492 --> 43:16.794
Here we go.

43:16.794 --> 43:18.129
Whey!

43:18.763 --> 43:20.098
GROUP: Wallase!

43:20.098 --> 43:21.866
GORDON: Oh man. There.

43:21.866 --> 43:23.367
WOMAN: Is it a little
chilly for you, Chef?

43:23.367 --> 43:24.802
GORDON: It is freezing.

43:24.802 --> 43:26.070
Come on.

43:26.070 --> 43:28.039
WOMAN: Thank you so much.

43:28.039 --> 43:29.474
GORDON: Excellent.

43:29.474 --> 43:32.043
Tough one cooking for a
table of fishermen that
really know their stuff.

43:32.043 --> 43:33.578
WOMAN: Here we go.

43:33.578 --> 43:36.681
GORDON: Also, they
get to taste this kind of
ingredient on a daily basis.

43:36.681 --> 43:39.517
MAN: I mean, all the
stuff on the charcuterie tray;

43:39.750 --> 43:40.818
there's a lot
going on there.

43:40.818 --> 43:42.386
WOMAN: Have you had the soup?

43:42.386 --> 43:44.689
It's got that Umami
thing going on.

43:46.090 --> 43:47.425
GORDON: All going well?

43:47.425 --> 43:50.995
LIONEL: Yeah, I think
everyone is enjoying
and everyone is smiling.

43:51.529 --> 43:54.832
MAN 2: Have you ever
got salmon that is
cooked to perfection,

43:55.500 --> 43:56.868
where it's under cooked

43:56.868 --> 43:59.036
slightly and you can
see that orange in it?

43:59.036 --> 44:02.807
MAN: You know you can leave
it kind of raw in the middle
and serve it like tuna and

44:02.807 --> 44:04.575
it's like oh my God!

44:04.575 --> 44:05.810
MAN 2: Delicious.
Very good.

44:05.810 --> 44:07.945
GORDON: When he sees
that salmon in so many ways,

44:07.945 --> 44:10.414
for a guy that hunts on
a daily basis for salmon,

44:10.414 --> 44:12.350
yet he's still excited,
it's so good to see.

44:13.050 --> 44:15.853
EVERYONE: To fresh
fish, Alaskan fish!

44:16.654 --> 44:18.556
GORDON: It's judgement time.

44:19.090 --> 44:20.858
EVERYONE: Woo. Yeah!

44:21.359 --> 44:22.560
LIONEL: Hey guys.

44:22.560 --> 44:23.794
GORDON: Good to see you.

44:23.794 --> 44:25.129
Honestly.

44:25.129 --> 44:27.798
Man, I'm going to take
my hat off for the
first time all day.

44:27.798 --> 44:29.066
We good?

44:29.066 --> 44:30.134
WOMAN: Really good.

44:30.134 --> 44:31.402
MAN: Really enjoying it.

44:31.402 --> 44:33.437
It's almost all gone.

44:33.804 --> 44:35.339
WOMAN: We're just
being polite.

44:35.339 --> 44:36.774
GORDON: That is
a happy problem.

44:36.774 --> 44:38.509
What did you think of the
gravlax on the water cress?

44:38.509 --> 44:43.781
WOMAN 2: It was a little
salty, but focusing on the
spruce tips really kind of

44:44.081 --> 44:46.584
balanced that out a bit
after I took a second helping.

44:46.984 --> 44:48.219
LIONEL: How was the stew?

44:48.219 --> 44:51.289
WOMAN 2: I just didn't
feel like it really fit well.

44:51.656 --> 44:53.224
GORDON: Man,
these guys are tough.

44:53.224 --> 44:55.426
That stew was delicious.

44:55.426 --> 44:56.994
WOMAN: And I was
just the opposite.

44:56.994 --> 44:59.363
I just felt like
all of these different
flavors came together,

44:59.363 --> 45:01.265
it had that whole
Umami thing going on.

45:01.265 --> 45:03.067
And I just loved it.

45:03.067 --> 45:04.735
GORDON: How was the salmon?

45:04.735 --> 45:07.371
MAN 2: Most of us never buy
a salmon in a restaurant because
it's usually over cooked,

45:07.371 --> 45:08.906
but that was
cooked to perfection.

45:08.906 --> 45:10.274
And that needs to be
a feature somewhere.

45:10.274 --> 45:11.909
It was amazing,
it was amazing.

45:11.909 --> 45:14.345
MAN: I think everybody
appreciated that you
didn't over cook it.

45:14.345 --> 45:17.782
LIONEL: So do you guys
feel like he's captured
the spirit of Alaska in the

45:17.782 --> 45:19.317
time that he's been here?

45:19.317 --> 45:21.419
WOMAN: Yes.
EVERYONE: Yes, absolutely.

45:21.419 --> 45:23.387
GORDON: Oh boy, I've
had a fantastic week.

45:23.387 --> 45:25.389
From a chef's point
of view, getting that
close to the source,

45:25.389 --> 45:27.158
we say it on a daily basis,

45:27.158 --> 45:30.194
the better the ingredient
the little that needs doing it.

45:30.194 --> 45:34.398
And Alaska has
literally come up trumps
from my culinary world.

45:35.132 --> 45:36.701
So, can I come back?

45:36.701 --> 45:38.669
WOMAN: Yes!
Oh my gosh, please do.

45:39.170 --> 45:41.706
MAN: To you! Cheers!

45:41.939 --> 45:44.008
GORDON: When you're
closer to the action
like I've been all week,

45:44.008 --> 45:46.010
it makes it
so much more magical.

45:46.010 --> 45:49.247
But then the stories of
being mauled by a bear and

45:49.247 --> 45:50.948
hunting and
surviving out here and

45:50.948 --> 45:54.652
just how tough it is,
it's pretty difficult.

45:55.052 --> 45:58.322
But here in south east
Alaska they've learned to
adapt and I've witnessed

45:58.322 --> 46:00.825
an incredible culinary
resourcefulness.

46:00.825 --> 46:02.994
Embracing the native culture,

46:03.995 --> 46:07.498
hunting and gathering,
delicious wild ingredients.

46:08.099 --> 46:10.835
They've made the best
of a brutal environment.

46:10.835 --> 46:15.106
Their sense of community
has allowed them to not
only survive, but thrive.

46:15.406 --> 46:16.941
Thank you. God bless.

46:16.941 --> 46:18.175
LIONEL: Thank you.

46:18.175 --> 46:19.477
GORDON: Chef, good
to see you, man.

46:19.477 --> 46:21.312
I'm coming back, okay?
Hopefully when
the snow is gone!
