00:02.235 --> 00:04.003
So, this morning,
I looked in the mirror
and I realized

00:04.005 --> 00:06.505
I don't have a job,

00:06.507 --> 00:09.341
A girlfriend,
or any money
in the bank.

00:09.343 --> 00:11.377
And if
I'm not careful,

00:11.379 --> 00:13.012
I could become
a failure.

00:14.514 --> 00:16.615
Uh, "become"?

00:16.617 --> 00:19.218
Lacey, nolan's
being vulnerable.

00:19.220 --> 00:21.420
The least you
could do is stop texting
while you insult him.

00:21.422 --> 00:22.721
I'm sorry.

00:22.723 --> 00:25.057
Uh, "become"?

00:25.059 --> 00:27.793
Come on, guys.
This is a support group.

00:27.795 --> 00:29.795
Would anyone care
to support nolan?

00:29.797 --> 00:31.497
I'll jump in there.

00:31.499 --> 00:35.768
Nolan,
I support you 110%.

00:35.770 --> 00:38.203
If you believe you can be
a complete failure,

00:38.205 --> 00:40.472
I say go for it.

00:40.474 --> 00:42.775
Thank you, ed.

00:42.777 --> 00:45.377
All right, all right,
enough with this dog pile
of support.

00:45.379 --> 00:47.146
Just because you don't
have everything you want

00:47.148 --> 00:48.580
Doesn't mean
you're a failure.

00:48.582 --> 00:50.783
Oh, my god.
It so does.

00:50.785 --> 00:53.485
No, no. It just means
you have to try harder.

00:53.487 --> 00:55.087
Look at me.

00:55.089 --> 00:57.089
I have submitted
half a dozen research papers,

00:57.091 --> 00:59.358
Hoping to get
a government grant,
and so far, nothing.

00:59.360 --> 01:01.060
Do I dwell on it?

01:01.062 --> 01:03.529
Do I wish bad things
on the winners?

01:03.531 --> 01:05.531
Sometimes.

01:05.533 --> 01:07.399
But I don't consider
myself a failure.

01:07.401 --> 01:08.667
Really?

01:08.669 --> 01:11.637
What are you
waiting for?

01:11.639 --> 01:13.439
You people
have lost perspective.

01:13.441 --> 01:16.175
You may not have
what you want, but you
have what you need.

01:16.177 --> 01:17.342
Oh, yeah.
Easy for you to say.

01:17.344 --> 01:18.844
I'm a man
in my late 20s

01:18.846 --> 01:22.114
And I have yet to summer
on martha's vineyard.

01:22.116 --> 01:25.551
And yet you hide your pain
for minutes at a time.

01:25.553 --> 01:28.220
Lacey, you still
on community service
for your probation?

01:28.222 --> 01:29.621
I have, like,
300 hours left,

01:29.623 --> 01:32.391
But I figure I can
knock it out in a weekend.

01:32.393 --> 01:34.760
There's a soup kitchen
that sam and I help out
on the holidays.

01:34.762 --> 01:37.329
I want you all to spend
a couple days there before
our next session.

01:37.331 --> 01:39.565
- Oh, man.
- I can't, I'm busy
this weekend.

01:39.567 --> 01:42.334
I have a class in...

01:42.336 --> 01:46.171
Making up better excuses
on the fly.

01:46.173 --> 01:48.440
I'll count it as a full
session on your records.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.742
<i>Trust me, it'll be</i>
<i>very fulfilling.</i>

01:50.744 --> 01:52.444
See you all
next Tuesday.

01:55.116 --> 01:57.850
Nah, I got to go back
through those research grants

01:57.852 --> 01:59.485
And figure out what
the hell I'm doing wrong.

01:59.487 --> 02:01.286
- I feel like such a...
- Failure?

02:01.288 --> 02:03.255
- No.
- Person of little success?

02:03.257 --> 02:04.890
Closer.

02:05.892 --> 02:07.726
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

02:09.896 --> 02:12.664
Mmm.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.166
You know, they sell
those in stores.

02:14.168 --> 02:15.734
Yeah, but have you seen
how much they cost?

02:15.736 --> 02:18.804
It's outrageous.
Yours are much more affordable.

02:18.806 --> 02:21.840
Hey, what do you say
you and I go see the
roller derby tonight?

02:21.842 --> 02:24.376
Roller derby. Sure,
then we can swing
by al's diner

02:24.378 --> 02:26.778
And hang out
with ralph malph
and potsie.

02:26.780 --> 02:28.914
Derby's back,
charles.

02:28.916 --> 02:30.549
It's better
than ever.

02:30.551 --> 02:33.252
What more could you ask for
than 6-foot-tall ladies

02:33.254 --> 02:35.921
With missing teeth
elbowing each other
into your lap?

02:35.923 --> 02:38.824
I don't know,
teeth.

02:40.460 --> 02:41.827
What else have you
got to do?

02:41.829 --> 02:43.162
You're not hooking up
with kate anymore.

02:43.164 --> 02:44.429
No, we're
still friends.

02:44.431 --> 02:45.864
I was thinking of picking up
some chinese

02:45.866 --> 02:48.567
And heading over
to her place and seeing
what happens.

02:48.569 --> 02:50.569
Dude, you had a fight,
she got mad,

02:50.571 --> 02:51.937
She cut off the sex
to make a point.

02:51.939 --> 02:53.772
If you leave her alone,
she'll come back.

02:53.774 --> 02:55.574
You know women.

02:55.576 --> 02:58.510
I mean, I don't,
but you do.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.245
You know what?
You're right.

03:00.247 --> 03:01.647
I'm gonna let her
come to me.

03:01.649 --> 03:03.649
So, roller derby
tonight?

03:03.651 --> 03:05.484
Yeah, no.

03:05.486 --> 03:07.486
All right.

03:07.488 --> 03:09.555
If you change your mind,
meet me there.

03:09.557 --> 03:10.856
How would I find you?

03:10.858 --> 03:12.858
I'll be the black guy
at roller derby.

03:14.827 --> 03:17.196
- <i>( knock on door )</i>
<i>- coming!</i>

03:18.765 --> 03:20.566
- Hey, jen.
- What are you
doing here?

03:20.568 --> 03:22.401
Well, I think I'm here
to pick up our daughter,

03:22.403 --> 03:24.536
But if you'd like to keep her,
I'd consider a buyout.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.972
Right, she'll be back
in a minute.

03:26.974 --> 03:28.974
But this is good.

03:28.976 --> 03:31.810
I have a story to tell you
you're gonna love.

03:31.812 --> 03:34.813
Do you remember that guy
sean I was going out with?

03:34.815 --> 03:37.916
The bozo who told sam
that college was
a waste of time?

03:37.918 --> 03:40.886
Right, that guy.
But you guys had
some fun times, right?

03:40.888 --> 03:44.590
I tried to hit him
with a lamp.

03:44.592 --> 03:48.293
Good times.
Well, I have
some great news.

03:48.295 --> 03:50.963
He's dead?

03:50.965 --> 03:52.898
We're back
together again!

03:52.900 --> 03:55.634
Isn't that crazy?
How crazy is that?

03:55.636 --> 03:56.768
That is-- that--
that is crazy.

03:56.770 --> 03:58.770
You're back together
with a dead guy.

03:58.772 --> 04:00.539
Charlie,
he's different now.

04:00.541 --> 04:02.941
He lost the two ferraris,
the nightclub...

04:02.943 --> 04:04.443
He's so arrogant.

04:04.445 --> 04:06.878
No, he's not anymore.
He's super humble.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.981
You see? You see,
that's how arrogant he is.

04:08.983 --> 04:11.950
He can't just be humble,
he's got to be super humble.

04:11.952 --> 04:13.885
Ah, charlie.

04:13.887 --> 04:16.255
Wasn't expecting
to see you here today.

04:16.257 --> 04:17.789
Oh, my god.
Zombie attack.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.591
Ah.

04:19.593 --> 04:20.892
I don't know
what that means.

04:20.894 --> 04:23.328
It's okay, sean.
Good to see you.

04:23.330 --> 04:25.464
Yeah, hi.
Good to see you also.

04:25.466 --> 04:27.332
- Hey, dad.
- Hey, sam.

04:27.334 --> 04:29.735
So sean's taking sam
to run errands now?

04:29.737 --> 04:32.004
No, I took him.

04:32.006 --> 04:34.773
- He let me drive.
- You what?

04:34.775 --> 04:38.377
She did so good.
You know who she
reminds me of?

04:38.379 --> 04:40.646
Who's that woman?
The race car driver?

04:40.648 --> 04:44.783
- She did commercials
for the thing she was...
- Yeah, all those.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.351
...Trying to sell, I think.
It was, like, a dana, was it?

04:46.353 --> 04:47.819
I know who you mean.

04:47.821 --> 04:49.521
- No, it's not.
It's like...
- She's pretty.

04:49.523 --> 04:51.290
Danica patrick!

04:53.660 --> 04:54.893
She's very pretty.

04:57.330 --> 04:59.431
I'm gonna go start dinner
'cause that's in the other room.

04:59.433 --> 05:02.467
- And I'll help.
- Please.

05:04.804 --> 05:06.972
That guy took my daughter
on her first driving lesson?

05:06.974 --> 05:09.541
He's going down.
Pick a lamp.

05:09.543 --> 05:12.511
I had no idea sean
was gonna do that.

05:12.513 --> 05:14.346
Please don't make
more of this than it is.

05:14.348 --> 05:16.548
Hey, dad.
Can I stay here tonight?

05:16.550 --> 05:19.518
Sean's gonna
teach me how to make
homemade ravioli.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.553
Sure, sweetie.

05:23.856 --> 05:25.957
Her first ravioli.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.895
Where is my pizza?

05:29.897 --> 05:32.864
Whatever happened to your
"30 minutes or less" policy?

05:32.866 --> 05:35.901
It ended 20 years ago?
Well, screw that noise.

05:37.537 --> 05:39.838
I'm-- I'm sorry.
I'm going through a lot
of stuff right now

05:39.840 --> 05:42.474
With my girlfriend
and my kid.

05:42.476 --> 05:44.076
My ex is dating
a douchebag.

05:44.078 --> 05:45.911
Why am I
telling you this?

05:45.913 --> 05:49.915
- Just get my pizza here.
- <i>( doorbell rings )</i>

05:49.917 --> 05:51.983
Finally.

05:56.956 --> 05:59.791
You're not the pizza.
You're a woman.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.360
Why haven't you
answered your phone?

06:01.362 --> 06:02.828
I've been
trying to call.

06:02.830 --> 06:04.696
I'm juggling
a lot of things
right now.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.798
I'm ordering
a pizza and I'm--

06:06.800 --> 06:08.967
And that's
about it.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.435
So, I talked to jen today

06:10.437 --> 06:12.137
And she told me all about
that sean thing.

06:12.139 --> 06:14.139
That sucks, so I thought
maybe you'd want me

06:14.141 --> 06:16.875
To come over
and hang out with you.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.610
You did?
Why?

06:18.612 --> 06:21.480
'cause I'm your friend
and I was concerned.

06:21.482 --> 06:23.982
My friend?

06:23.984 --> 06:25.117
Come here, buddy.

06:25.119 --> 06:27.586
Hey, charlie.
What are you doing?

06:27.588 --> 06:28.887
Oh, please.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.522
I stayed away,
you cooled off,

06:30.524 --> 06:32.591
And now you're here
for a classic booty call.

06:32.593 --> 06:35.127
Don't deny it.
You got here faster
than the pizza.

06:35.129 --> 06:37.028
Okay, this was a bad idea.

06:37.030 --> 06:38.930
Good night, I'll see you
in session tomorrow.

06:38.932 --> 06:41.800
Or we could talk about it
in bed right now.

06:41.802 --> 06:43.835
'cause isn't that
why you're really here?

06:43.837 --> 06:46.471
No, it isn't.

06:46.473 --> 06:50.409
I'm-- I'm sorry.
I must've misread things.

06:50.411 --> 06:52.611
Or did I?

06:52.613 --> 06:53.945
Good night.

06:57.984 --> 06:59.985
Oh, look.
The pizza guy's here.

06:59.987 --> 07:01.653
He obviously wants to
have sex with you

07:01.655 --> 07:03.588
Because
he showed up, too.

07:07.860 --> 07:09.761
Oh, my god.
This is horrible.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.763
I can't believe
I agreed to do this.

07:11.765 --> 07:14.533
I can't believe
you're gonna eat this.

07:14.535 --> 07:16.768
I'm so amazed this is
a soup kitchen.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.003
I always thought
it was a restaurant.

07:18.005 --> 07:21.006
I've eaten here,
like, five times.

07:21.008 --> 07:23.675
It's so sad.
I mean, you look in
these people's eyes

07:23.677 --> 07:28.780
Most of them have
never had bottle service
in the vip room.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.183
Sir, you're on
the wrong side
of the counter.

07:31.185 --> 07:32.918
If you come over here,

07:32.920 --> 07:35.220
You'll get
yourself a hot meal
and some new clothes.

07:35.222 --> 07:38.056
What are you doing,
yankin' my nuts?
I'm not homeless.

07:38.058 --> 07:40.826
He's very proud.
I think you should
hose him down

07:40.828 --> 07:43.695
And don't take no
for an answer.

07:43.697 --> 07:47.232
- Let's go, sir.
- What in the hell makes
you think I'm homeless?

07:47.234 --> 07:50.035
How long have you
been wearing that shirt?

07:50.037 --> 07:52.938
I don't know.
Maybe a week.

07:52.940 --> 07:55.240
I see.

07:55.242 --> 07:58.009
Would you prefer
rice or potatoes?

07:58.011 --> 08:00.145
( sighs )

08:00.147 --> 08:02.747
Ah, the hell with it.
Give me the spuds.

08:03.883 --> 08:06.051
God bless you, sir.

08:08.020 --> 08:10.755
Boy, when you look around,
it really makes you think.

08:10.757 --> 08:13.959
"there but for
the grace of god go I."

08:13.961 --> 08:16.862
( scoffs ) not I.
I chose to save my money

08:16.864 --> 08:19.531
So I could go to
design school and become
a fashion designer.

08:19.533 --> 08:22.200
These people, aside from
the occasional lunatic,

08:22.202 --> 08:24.803
Made very poor
choices in life.

08:24.805 --> 08:27.706
( coughs )
so you're going to
design school, huh?

08:27.708 --> 08:29.674
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I went to
design school, too.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.176
Can I have
a piece of chicken?

08:31.178 --> 08:33.745
Well, not
everybody makes it.

08:33.747 --> 08:35.680
Yeah. I did.

08:35.682 --> 08:38.717
Yeah, I spent six years
working for hilfiger

08:38.719 --> 08:40.552
In his west coast
design shop.

08:40.554 --> 08:43.688
Then I did accessories
for ralph lauren.

08:43.690 --> 08:46.258
- You did?
- Crazy world, huh?

08:46.260 --> 08:48.727
Hey, can you make sure
the bread is soft,

08:48.729 --> 08:52.864
I've missed my last
152 dental appointments.

08:56.269 --> 08:58.136
Can a homeless man
get a dessert?

08:58.138 --> 09:00.805
They're letting me
in the shoe room
in five minutes.

09:05.311 --> 09:06.678
Dude.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.547
<i>( door slams )</i>

09:08.549 --> 09:09.748
You have any
protein powder?

09:09.750 --> 09:11.883
Why are you
screaming at me?

09:11.885 --> 09:13.885
I brought home
a roller derby
girl last night

09:13.887 --> 09:15.754
And she needs
protein powder.

09:15.756 --> 09:17.722
You brought home
a roller derby girl?

09:17.724 --> 09:20.759
I told her I have
a smooth driveway.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.894
Right.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.130
I don't have
any protein powder.

09:26.299 --> 09:27.966
Here's some
pancake mix.

09:27.968 --> 09:29.868
Blend in some
ice cream, she won't
know the difference.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.736
Thanks.

09:31.738 --> 09:35.907
You know, I could
set you up with one
of her giant friends.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.577
Unless kate came
crawling back to you.

09:38.579 --> 09:40.779
No, I thought she did

09:40.781 --> 09:42.714
And I might have messed up
our friendship.

09:42.716 --> 09:44.149
Well, maybe that's
for the best, man.

09:44.151 --> 09:46.051
That situation
with you and kate
was no good.

09:46.053 --> 09:47.752
You really believe that?

09:47.754 --> 09:49.187
Nah, you had
sex on demand

09:49.189 --> 09:51.890
With a crazy hot biddy
who was into the weird.

09:51.892 --> 09:54.192
Sometimes there's
no silver lining, charlie.

09:55.928 --> 09:57.095
Charlie, we need to talk.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.897
-  <i>Hey, michael.</i>
<i>- Hey, jen.</i>

09:58.899 --> 10:01.099
I'm out.

10:01.101 --> 10:04.102
I'm off to buy my lady
some knee pads.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.237
It's not what you
think it's for.

10:06.239 --> 10:07.939
And also it is.

10:09.709 --> 10:11.643
Charlie...

10:11.645 --> 10:14.946
Sean's really sorry
and he wants to take you
out for a drink.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.314
Why don't we
bring sam along

10:16.316 --> 10:18.149
So he can buy her
her first beer?

10:18.151 --> 10:21.786
He hasn't done
that yet... Has he?

10:21.788 --> 10:23.822
Look, he made a mistake.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.790
He doesn't have kids,
so he doesn't know better.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.659
I wish he had kids.

10:27.661 --> 10:29.728
I'd take 'em to disneyland
for the first time

10:29.730 --> 10:33.331
And go on their
first rides and stand
in those long lines

10:33.333 --> 10:35.900
And buy them
overpriced food and--

10:35.902 --> 10:38.203
I got to find someplace else
to take these imaginary kids.

10:38.205 --> 10:40.271
Charlie, I like him.

10:40.273 --> 10:42.707
And I don't want there
to be tension between you two.

10:42.709 --> 10:44.776
- Please.
- Fine.

10:44.778 --> 10:45.977
I'll go,
but he's buying.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.879
No, no, you're
doing me a favor,

10:47.881 --> 10:50.215
So I'm taking care
of this one.

10:50.217 --> 10:51.816
Wait a minute.
He's the one who
screwed up.

10:51.818 --> 10:53.251
He should be
paying for the drinks.

10:53.253 --> 10:55.353
Are you telling me
he can't even afford that?

10:55.355 --> 10:57.122
I'm not telling you
anything.

10:57.124 --> 10:58.423
But it's true.

10:58.425 --> 11:00.792
Yes.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.163
Okay, here's 50.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.831
Wow, diamond jim.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.133
You cash
my alimony check?

11:08.135 --> 11:09.834
Just came back
from the bank.

11:09.836 --> 11:11.236
Let the good times roll.

11:11.238 --> 11:12.804
Ah, here's another 10.

11:12.806 --> 11:14.039
Buy yourself
something pretty.

11:17.977 --> 11:19.778
Jen probably talked
to you about it already,

11:19.780 --> 11:22.847
But I'm really sorry
about the whole sam
driving thing.

11:22.849 --> 11:25.316
What can I say?
I'm a dick.

11:25.318 --> 11:27.452
Finally, something
we can agree on.

11:27.454 --> 11:29.821
I don't know anything
about kids, you know?

11:29.823 --> 11:32.691
My parents were terrible,
terrible role models.

11:32.693 --> 11:34.125
You know who
taught me how to drive?

11:34.127 --> 11:36.261
My sister's alcoholic
mother's husband.

11:37.863 --> 11:39.998
- Wouldn't that be
your father?
- Yeah.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.901
He sucked so bad,
we took away his title.

11:45.104 --> 11:47.706
Yeah, my dad was
a real piece of work, too.

11:47.708 --> 11:49.040
First time I ever drove
was to take him to the store

11:49.042 --> 11:51.810
So he could buy a belt
to beat me with.

11:51.812 --> 11:53.178
You got beaten with
a store-bought belt?

11:53.180 --> 11:55.880
That's fancy.

11:55.882 --> 11:58.283
Well, his father beat him
with a tree branch.

11:58.285 --> 12:00.919
- You always want
better for your kids.
- It's a step up.

12:03.022 --> 12:05.190
Listen, sean,
all we got to be clear on

12:05.192 --> 12:06.858
Is that when
you're around sam,

12:06.860 --> 12:08.827
Just be aware
that there's another
parent involved, okay?

12:08.829 --> 12:10.762
You got it.
All right, I--

12:10.764 --> 12:12.831
Trust me, now that
I'm moving in,

12:12.833 --> 12:14.899
I'm not gonna make a move
without telling you about
it first, all right?

12:14.901 --> 12:16.167
Thank you.

12:16.169 --> 12:18.837
I'm sorry, you're what?
You're moving in?

12:18.839 --> 12:20.905
Yeah.

12:20.907 --> 12:23.808
Jen didn't
tell you that?

12:23.810 --> 12:25.844
Why, no, she did not
tell me that.

12:27.813 --> 12:29.080
I mean, you're cool
with it, right?

12:29.082 --> 12:32.217
Am I cool with it?
Let's see.

12:32.219 --> 12:35.186
- Let me run down
the cool checklist.
- All right.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.489
You got no money,
no job,

12:37.491 --> 12:39.858
- And you're living in
the house that I pay for.
- Ahem.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.993
On the other hand,
you are super arrogant.

12:41.995 --> 12:43.828
So, no, dude,
I am not cool with it.

12:43.830 --> 12:47.031
- Check, please.
- Okay.

12:47.033 --> 12:49.234
Well, this
is super awkward.

12:49.236 --> 12:52.270
Um, listen, jen
gave you enough cash

12:52.272 --> 12:54.839
To cover my portion
of the tab, right?

12:54.841 --> 12:56.007
Yeah.

12:56.009 --> 12:57.942
Did she give you
a little extra

12:57.944 --> 12:59.878
So I could, like,
grab a sandwich
or something?

12:59.880 --> 13:01.246
I didn't eat
anything.

13:01.248 --> 13:04.849
It's not jen's money.
It's my money.

13:04.851 --> 13:07.786
And I am this close
to taking off my
store-bought belt.

13:15.161 --> 13:17.796
Aren't you
a little overdressed
for a soup kitchen?

13:17.798 --> 13:20.498
Are you kidding me?
I'm so boosting morale
around here.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.801
Everyone's, like,
"this place isn't so bad.

13:22.803 --> 13:25.103
Check out that
hot piece of ass
ladling soup."

13:27.273 --> 13:31.342
The ironic thing was
I felt I was better
than everybody else.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.978
Oh, my god.
I felt the same way.

13:33.980 --> 13:36.014
I didn't realize
that we're all

13:36.016 --> 13:39.250
Just a couple of
bad breaks away from
sleeping on the street.

13:39.252 --> 13:41.252
Oh, I don't sleep
on the street.

13:41.254 --> 13:44.155
No, I sleep in an old pipe
on a construction site.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.859
But this year
I hope to summer

13:47.861 --> 13:49.961
At a mcdonald's playland
near the beach.

13:52.398 --> 13:54.499
That's your
martha's vineyard.

13:54.501 --> 13:57.135
Here, please, I have
to give you some more money.

13:57.137 --> 13:59.904
No, no, please.
You've done too
much already.

13:59.906 --> 14:01.840
I feel guilty
that I have so much.

14:01.842 --> 14:03.541
Here's another 20.

14:03.543 --> 14:05.476
It's all I have left.

14:07.313 --> 14:08.947
I got to get back
to the line.

14:08.949 --> 14:11.883
You know, I envy you,
patrick.

14:11.885 --> 14:13.084
I wish someone
had told me

14:13.086 --> 14:14.619
That pride comes
before a fall.

14:14.621 --> 14:18.256
Or, in our case, before
the fall collection.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.459
Auf wiedersehen.

14:26.298 --> 14:29.400
Ed, come on.
You're supposed
to be working here.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.936
Who died and put
you in charge?

14:33.038 --> 14:35.206
I don't have
to serve here.

14:35.208 --> 14:38.910
I served in a little
soup kitchen called vietnam.

14:38.912 --> 14:43.181
The only difference was,
in 'nam, pajamas were free.

14:43.183 --> 14:45.617
But you had to kill
the people in 'em.

14:58.264 --> 15:00.098
Hey.

15:01.300 --> 15:02.901
What do you want?

15:02.903 --> 15:05.169
Did I hear you say
you served in 'nam?

15:07.306 --> 15:08.907
Which branch?

15:08.909 --> 15:11.242
Army.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.577
Me, too.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.345
Desert storm.

15:14.347 --> 15:17.015
Loved to serve, but...

15:17.017 --> 15:19.584
Sure was a long way
from texas.

15:19.586 --> 15:22.921
Texas is your home, too?

15:22.923 --> 15:26.124
When I had a home.

15:26.126 --> 15:28.159
Oh, gee, I'm sorry.

15:32.331 --> 15:34.599
Thanks for coming,
but please tell caroline

15:34.601 --> 15:36.401
That I can't help her
with her fear

15:36.403 --> 15:39.237
Of leaving her house
if she keeps sending
her assistant in

15:39.239 --> 15:40.972
To do her therapy
sessions for her.

15:44.343 --> 15:46.277
- Hey, charlie.
- Hey.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.646
Listen, I'm really sorry
about the other night.

15:48.648 --> 15:51.516
And I get it.
Sex is off the table...

15:51.518 --> 15:53.117
And the floor and the roof
of your building.

15:53.119 --> 15:55.019
All the usual places.

15:55.021 --> 15:57.155
Thanks and I get it.

15:57.157 --> 15:58.589
I mean, this new dynamic
in our friendship

15:58.591 --> 16:00.091
Is making things
a little confusing,

16:00.093 --> 16:01.559
So why don't we just go in

16:01.561 --> 16:04.095
And deal with the other issues
in your life, not you and me.

16:04.097 --> 16:06.464
No problem.
Believe me, I got
plenty to talk about.

16:07.700 --> 16:10.335
So, tell me
what's going on.

16:10.337 --> 16:13.671
- You're ruining my life.
- Okay, didn't I just...

16:13.673 --> 16:15.573
I'm kidding.
It was a joke.

16:16.642 --> 16:18.142
Here's the big headline.

16:18.144 --> 16:21.679
Unemployed sean
is moving in with
alimony jen.

16:21.681 --> 16:24.582
Oh, wow.
Well, you must really
resent that.

16:24.584 --> 16:26.684
But it's her life
and her choices

16:26.686 --> 16:28.720
And you have
to accept that.

16:28.722 --> 16:30.688
I know I should,
but I can't.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.590
Why am I always
attracted to women

16:32.592 --> 16:35.426
Who don't have the sense
to know who they should
or shouldn't be with?

16:35.428 --> 16:37.595
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- What?

16:37.597 --> 16:40.398
That wasn't just about jen.
That was about you and me.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.700
Oh, right, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize
I was doing that.

16:42.702 --> 16:44.769
I will keep
them separate.

16:44.771 --> 16:46.637
Here we go.
( sighs )

16:46.639 --> 16:48.573
Jen made a decision
that I don't agree
with at all,

16:48.575 --> 16:52.176
But it affects me and I have
no say in the matter.

16:52.178 --> 16:53.611
How come you women
don't give a crap

16:53.613 --> 16:55.513
About anyone's feelings
but your own?

16:56.782 --> 16:58.583
Hold it, hold it,
hold it.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.051
What?

17:00.053 --> 17:01.619
You're including me again.

17:01.621 --> 17:04.188
Oh, my god.
I'm so sorry.

17:04.190 --> 17:07.225
Obviously, our relationship
or lack of one

17:07.227 --> 17:09.727
Is weighing heavily on me
and it's bleeding through.

17:09.729 --> 17:12.096
But I'm aware of it now
and I've got a handle on it,

17:12.098 --> 17:13.765
So I think
we can continue.

17:13.767 --> 17:15.666
Well said.
Thank you.

17:15.668 --> 17:18.636
Now, what is
your issue with jen?

17:18.638 --> 17:20.605
Well, it's very simple.

17:20.607 --> 17:22.707
What the hell
is your problem, lady?

17:22.709 --> 17:24.342
We should have sex
and be together!

17:27.212 --> 17:28.813
That time I knew
what I was doing.

17:34.586 --> 17:36.454
Hey, guys.

17:36.456 --> 17:40.224
And hopefully that will help
us explore some core issues.

17:40.226 --> 17:42.493
Charlie:
<i>Ernesto, you said...</i>

17:42.495 --> 17:46.597
Your dad's "playboys"
from the 1980s.

17:46.599 --> 17:49.634
The women were
mesmerizing.

17:49.636 --> 17:51.369
And I also learned
a lot about

17:51.371 --> 17:53.671
Where to place
my living room speakers.

17:55.674 --> 17:59.544
Donovan, you said,
"oh, the places you'll go!"

17:59.546 --> 18:01.779
I sure wish dr. Seuss
woulda written a book

18:01.781 --> 18:03.714
About the places
I shouldn't have gone.

18:04.817 --> 18:07.752
Like a gas station
with a gun in my hand.

18:09.354 --> 18:10.755
Or disneyland.

18:10.757 --> 18:14.525
$10 for a piece of pizza
and    <i>i</i>in jail.

18:14.527 --> 18:16.160
You carjacked a bus.

18:16.162 --> 18:17.762
They overcharge
for pepperoni.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.730
I still agree with you.

18:20.699 --> 18:24.635
Wayne, you said
"alice in wonderland."

18:24.637 --> 18:26.471
I've always
loved that book.

18:26.473 --> 18:28.473
There's just something special
about a little girl

18:28.475 --> 18:30.842
Who falls down a hole
and can't get out.

18:33.679 --> 18:35.246
Congratulations, wayne.

18:35.248 --> 18:37.381
You just made a creepy book
a whole lot creepier.

18:38.517 --> 18:40.685
What books did you read
as a kid, charlie?

18:40.687 --> 18:43.754
Comic books.
Mostly "batman."

18:43.756 --> 18:47.358
If batman catches
the joker every time,

18:47.360 --> 18:49.660
Why doesn't the joker
move to a different city?

18:49.662 --> 18:52.563
- Because
the joker's insane.
- Mm.

18:52.565 --> 18:54.265
And the definition of insanity
is doing the same thing

18:54.267 --> 18:56.634
Over and over, expecting
a different result.

18:56.636 --> 18:59.904
I kept killing people,
hoping the voices would stop.

18:59.906 --> 19:02.740
Never worked.

19:02.742 --> 19:04.742
That is a perfect
example, wayne.

19:04.744 --> 19:06.544
And I know you don't
hear the voices anymore,

19:06.546 --> 19:09.480
Considering you're on
enough thorazine to kill
a baby elephant.

19:09.482 --> 19:10.848
I am?

19:12.651 --> 19:14.552
And that kind of
destructive behavior

19:14.554 --> 19:16.487
Is not just limited
to killing sprees.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.523
Oh, guilty as charged.

19:18.525 --> 19:20.691
When I first got locked up,
I had a crush on a young man.

19:20.693 --> 19:22.860
He had problems.
But no matter what I did,

19:22.862 --> 19:25.630
He would not change,
so I had to just walk away.

19:25.632 --> 19:28.533
Granted, he was in
the same cell, so it was
only, like, four feet.

19:28.535 --> 19:31.602
But you get
what I'm saying.

19:31.604 --> 19:33.738
Who is it?
I'll kill him.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.640
Oh, donovan.

19:35.642 --> 19:37.642
You already did.

19:41.713 --> 19:44.782
Well, not everybody's
as healthy as you, cleo.

19:45.751 --> 19:47.618
Some people
never walk away.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.687
Some people just keep
banging their head
against the wall

19:49.689 --> 19:53.891
Over and over
until they finally
realize that...

19:53.893 --> 19:56.761
She's never
gonna change.

19:56.763 --> 19:59.664
When did they
give it to me?

19:59.666 --> 20:01.699
Is it in the waffles?

20:03.335 --> 20:06.504
You're the only one
that gets waffles, wayne.

20:07.739 --> 20:09.540
Then, probably.

20:13.479 --> 20:17.715
Oh, charlie, hey.
I was just gonna
give you a call.

20:17.717 --> 20:20.284
You got to read this.

20:20.286 --> 20:23.454
I will read this
when I wanna read this.

20:23.456 --> 20:26.691
And I will talk
when I wanna talk
and I wanna talk now.

20:26.693 --> 20:28.826
You shut down
our relationship.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.795
I feel hurt
and rejected

20:30.797 --> 20:32.863
And I cannot stand here
and pretend like anything
we do here

20:32.865 --> 20:35.233
Is gonna make me feel better
when just looking at you

20:35.235 --> 20:41.272
<i>I realize that</i>
<i>the healthy thing</i>
<i>is for me to move on.</i>

20:41.274 --> 20:43.641
I don't want
to see you.

20:43.643 --> 20:45.576
I don't want
to talk to you.

20:45.578 --> 20:48.879
- We're done.
- Okay.

20:48.881 --> 20:51.983
- Are you finished?
- Yes.

20:51.985 --> 20:55.286
Now read the paper.

20:55.288 --> 20:56.754
Damn it.

20:56.756 --> 20:57.955
It's all about you,
isn't it?

20:57.957 --> 21:00.658
It's all about
what you want...

21:00.660 --> 21:01.826
And the fact that we got

21:01.828 --> 21:03.928
The big research grant
we applied for

21:03.930 --> 21:05.763
And we're gonna
be working together

21:05.765 --> 21:07.565
For the next
six months.

21:09.801 --> 21:11.936
Aren't you excited?
