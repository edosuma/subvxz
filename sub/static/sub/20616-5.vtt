WEBVTT

00:10.230 --> 00:13.295
There's a lot of chaos.

00:13.330 --> 00:16.670
He's like, "Get out of here.
I own this."

00:16.705 --> 00:19.470
You just grab
your head in agony.

00:19.505 --> 00:21.470
It literally felt like fire.

00:23.040 --> 00:25.110
You okay?

00:26.850 --> 00:28.950
I'm just hearing "knife."

00:28.985 --> 00:30.615
He died instantly.

00:30.650 --> 00:32.680
There's so much commotion here,

00:32.715 --> 00:35.615
it's ridiculous.

00:35.650 --> 00:38.190
This is not a good situation.

00:38.225 --> 00:39.942
My name is Amy Allan.

00:39.977 --> 00:41.625
There's death here.

00:41.660 --> 00:43.390
Don't wanna go down there.

00:43.400 --> 00:44.625
I see dead people.

00:44.660 --> 00:46.760
They hide in the walls
and they watch.

00:46.770 --> 00:49.430
I speak to dead people...

00:49.440 --> 00:52.240
She's definitely
a serial killer.

00:52.275 --> 00:54.242
...and they speak to me.

00:54.277 --> 00:56.175
She's going to torture them.

00:56.210 --> 01:00.010
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

01:00.045 --> 01:01.847
They were all murdered.

01:01.882 --> 01:03.551
I rely on my partner.

01:03.586 --> 01:05.185
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:05.220 --> 01:06.985
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:07.020 --> 01:09.720
So is this the only time
you've been physically attacked?

01:09.755 --> 01:13.255
I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:13.290 --> 01:17.130
There's no question in my mind
that he was talking about Satan.

01:17.165 --> 01:18.795
It's my job to reveal them.

01:18.830 --> 01:20.460
Who do you think
possessed you?

01:20.470 --> 01:22.595
But Steve and I never speak...

01:22.630 --> 01:24.670
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:24.705 --> 01:25.865
...until the very end.

01:25.900 --> 01:27.505
Well, you're not gonna want
to see this.

01:27.540 --> 01:29.610
When we uncover if it's safe
for you to stay...

01:29.645 --> 01:31.212
<i>Hell,</i> no.

01:31.247 --> 01:32.745
Or time to get out.

01:32.780 --> 01:34.780
Everyone is in jeopardy.

01:47.260 --> 01:50.890
I'm in Sahuarita, Arizona, about
a half-hour south of Tucson.

01:50.900 --> 01:52.680
I got a call
from a woman named Karen

01:52.715 --> 01:54.460
who just recently
moved into a new house.

01:54.470 --> 01:56.655
Now she says
all hell has broken loose

01:56.690 --> 01:58.805
and it's ripping
her marriage apart.

01:58.840 --> 02:01.540
But this is what has got
her most worried --

02:01.575 --> 02:03.575
Her daughter is
supposed to move in

02:03.610 --> 02:06.175
with her two grandkids soon,
and she's worried

02:06.210 --> 02:07.710
they're going to be stepping
into a paranormal war zone.

02:12.480 --> 02:14.320
Before Amy arrives,
I clear the house

02:14.355 --> 02:17.150
of any leading information --

02:17.160 --> 02:20.755
photographs, personal items.

02:20.790 --> 02:24.030
Even medical equipment
can influence her findings,

02:24.065 --> 02:27.865
so it's important I cover
or remove them all.

02:27.900 --> 02:31.130
When I'm done, the location will
be ready for tonight's walk.

02:44.080 --> 02:48.490
This place is really,
really bad.

02:48.525 --> 02:50.450
There's quite a lot going on.

02:50.460 --> 02:55.330
There's a lot of chaos,
a lot of chaos.

02:55.365 --> 02:57.425
It's <i> never</i> quiet.

02:57.460 --> 02:59.600
I can understand why
nobody would sleep here.

03:01.470 --> 03:05.240
There's so much commotion here,
it's ridiculous.

03:14.810 --> 03:17.650
So, Karen, when we spoke on
the phone, you sounded upset.

03:17.685 --> 03:19.385
What's going on?

03:19.420 --> 03:21.820
We bought this house
about a year and a half ago.

03:21.855 --> 03:24.385
This is our retirement home.

03:24.420 --> 03:27.060
It was supposed to be
the forever home...

03:29.930 --> 03:31.865
But it's not.

03:31.900 --> 03:35.670
So your retirement home
is basically a war zone.

03:35.705 --> 03:37.465
It is right now.

03:37.500 --> 03:38.665
You also mentioned
on the phone

03:38.700 --> 03:40.200
that you were concerned
about your husband.

03:40.210 --> 03:42.210
Yeah. His name is Don.

03:42.245 --> 03:43.370
Okay.

03:43.380 --> 03:46.165
And about 6 years ago,
he had a stroke.

03:46.200 --> 03:48.915
His moods changes
are getting worse.

03:48.950 --> 03:51.110
Little tiny things
will just make him blow up.

03:51.120 --> 03:53.115
I call him a human volcano.

03:53.150 --> 03:55.490
So it's just you and Don
that live here.

03:55.525 --> 03:56.655
Right now, yeah.

03:56.690 --> 03:59.325
In about 5 weeks,
my youngest daughter

03:59.360 --> 04:01.960
and two of my grandchildren
are moving in.

04:01.995 --> 04:03.330
And how old are her kids?

04:03.365 --> 04:05.965
4 and almost 9.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.930
So, Karen, you've got
to be concerned about

04:07.965 --> 04:09.635
a 4 and an 8-year-old
moving in here.

04:09.670 --> 04:12.920
Very concerned.
I'll do whatever you guys say.

04:12.955 --> 04:16.997
What exactly are you guys
experiencing here?

04:17.031 --> 04:21.040
There's everything
from noises and shadows

04:21.050 --> 04:24.685
to physical touching,
scratching.

04:24.720 --> 04:28.320
It's also affecting
my health.

04:28.355 --> 04:30.390
Okay. So what's going on?

04:30.425 --> 04:31.385
Headaches.

04:31.420 --> 04:34.720
It feels like hot prod
to the point

04:34.730 --> 04:37.930
where you just
grab your head in agony.

04:37.965 --> 04:41.965
I don't sleep.
I'm up all night.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.530
You know, what are you hoping
we can do for you guys?

04:44.540 --> 04:47.400
I'm hoping that we can get
a happy home

04:47.410 --> 04:49.975
for my daughter
and granddaughters,

04:50.010 --> 04:52.940
and I'm concerned with Don
being here all the time,

04:52.975 --> 04:55.412
so I want it to be
a good home.

04:55.447 --> 04:57.815
You're not asking for a lot.

04:57.850 --> 05:00.920
I don't think I could deal
with it if anything happened

05:00.955 --> 05:03.820
to the girls
or the grandchildren.

05:03.855 --> 05:06.360
I couldn't handle it.

05:11.260 --> 05:13.660
I do feel sick.

05:21.110 --> 05:23.275
I'm just getting, like,
horrible nausea,

05:23.310 --> 05:26.440
so somebody is dealing
with that, a living person.

05:26.450 --> 05:28.045
Headaches,

05:28.080 --> 05:31.210
you know,
with the insomnia.

05:34.450 --> 05:36.650
There is this guy here

05:36.660 --> 05:40.320
who is dressed like a priest,

05:40.330 --> 05:42.965
but I think he's lying
about being a priest.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.600
I think he's lying about
what he looks like.

05:45.635 --> 05:47.560
He could be a demon.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.555
The nausea, the headaches,
the not sleeping

05:53.590 --> 05:57.110
is a way that this thing
breaks people down

05:57.145 --> 05:59.410
so that it can get them.

06:06.850 --> 06:08.835
So what's going on
in this room?

06:08.870 --> 06:10.785
I was sitting
in my recliner.

06:10.820 --> 06:13.820
My leg started burning,
and I looked down,

06:13.830 --> 06:16.590
and I had scratches.

06:16.600 --> 06:18.700
How bad of a scratch
was it?

06:18.735 --> 06:21.082
- It raised the skin.
- Okay.

06:21.117 --> 06:23.430
And the worst part was
the burn.

06:23.440 --> 06:24.900
Now you told me you have cats.

06:24.935 --> 06:26.065
Could it have been the cats?

06:26.100 --> 06:27.635
No, 'cause they were
in their bedroom.

06:27.670 --> 06:29.770
Okay, so there was
no animals in here?
No.

06:29.780 --> 06:31.480
Okay, have you ever been
physically touched

06:31.515 --> 06:33.180
like that anyplace else
or before?
Yes.

06:33.215 --> 06:35.475
- Right in the hallway...
- Okay.

06:35.510 --> 06:38.920
...I was sweeping,
and I had my arm grabbed.

06:38.955 --> 06:40.820
Okay, describe to me
how it felt.

06:40.855 --> 06:42.915
Okay. Like that.

06:42.950 --> 06:44.155
- That hard?
- That hard.

06:44.190 --> 06:47.420
Now have you had
muscle spasms before?
No.

06:47.430 --> 06:48.860
All right,
is there anything else?

06:48.895 --> 06:50.895
Yeah. Shadows.

06:50.930 --> 06:52.465
I see a lot of shadows,

06:52.500 --> 06:56.665
and there's this almost
constant parade at times.

06:56.700 --> 06:59.700
All right, so do these shadows
have any shape, like a human?

06:59.735 --> 07:01.400
I don't really see them
as a shape.

07:01.410 --> 07:04.870
It's more of a mist
or a mass.

07:04.880 --> 07:06.380
Now how often
are you seeing them?

07:06.415 --> 07:07.680
Almost daily.

07:12.050 --> 07:15.420
People see a lot of...
outside here.

07:15.455 --> 07:18.150
There is a path,

07:18.160 --> 07:20.520
and then I got a line of, like,

07:20.530 --> 07:22.730
shadow people lining up.

07:24.730 --> 07:26.595
Yeah, they're all in line,

07:26.630 --> 07:29.265
one behind the other,
single file.

07:29.300 --> 07:31.570
But they're not shadow people.
They're dead people.

07:34.410 --> 07:36.910
Is there any connection
between this priest guy

07:36.945 --> 07:40.127
and these people that are
lined up and walking?

07:40.162 --> 07:43.310
I don't really know, but I think
these dead people,

07:43.320 --> 07:45.015
the living see them.

07:45.050 --> 07:47.150
I think they just, like,
see them, like,

07:47.185 --> 07:48.615
corner of their eye.

07:48.650 --> 07:51.220
They're somewhere in the house.

07:51.255 --> 07:54.120
It's very stressful.

07:54.130 --> 07:57.090
Stress. Stress.

07:57.100 --> 07:58.560
Stress.

08:05.340 --> 08:07.200
All right, so what's
going on down here?

08:07.210 --> 08:10.160
As I get into bed
and I'm just settling in,

08:10.195 --> 08:13.075
I felt somebody
crawl over the top of me.

08:13.110 --> 08:17.065
I'm in full prayer mode,
and it just went away.

08:17.100 --> 08:21.020
Any of the animals stay in bed
with you guys?

08:21.055 --> 08:23.285
No. No.
The dogs have kennels...

08:23.320 --> 08:25.660
Okay.
...that are over on
the far side of the room.

08:25.695 --> 08:28.355
Okay.

08:28.390 --> 08:30.330
All right.
so anything else?

08:30.365 --> 08:31.395
Well, yes.

08:31.430 --> 08:33.650
A couple nights ago,
when I laid down,

08:33.684 --> 08:36.361
I could feel something
sit next to me,

08:36.397 --> 08:39.005
pulling the blankets tight
around my legs.

08:39.039 --> 08:41.240
Okay, can you show me
how hard the pressure was?

08:41.275 --> 08:43.405
It was just like this.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.980
Okay, so as if a normal person
was sitting down on the bed.

08:46.015 --> 08:47.540
Right.

08:47.550 --> 08:50.650
I'm trying to figure out
what else it could be.

08:50.685 --> 08:52.745
I'm at a loss right now.

08:52.780 --> 08:55.335
I don't know why
they're grabbing me.

08:55.370 --> 08:57.665
And why would
they crawl over me?

08:57.700 --> 08:59.960
I just know
that I want them gone.

09:04.410 --> 09:07.560
Yeah.

09:07.570 --> 09:11.655
I'm seeing, like, vomiting,
crying, punching.

09:11.690 --> 09:15.740
And, I mean, I think
this is happening now

09:15.775 --> 09:18.070
with a living person here.

09:18.080 --> 09:21.640
They're vulnerable
to, priest man.

09:23.950 --> 09:26.215
The priest comes

09:26.250 --> 09:31.555
and becomes
as thin as the blanket,

09:31.590 --> 09:34.720
and then it's melding
into the person's body.

09:37.700 --> 09:40.800
So what is this thing doing to
this person when it does this?

09:40.835 --> 09:43.800
It goes inside of their body.

09:43.835 --> 09:45.130
Like, all the way in,

09:45.140 --> 09:49.360
into all of the bones
and the muscles and the tissues.

09:49.395 --> 09:53.580
I see it, like, affecting
the physiology of the person.

09:53.615 --> 09:55.080
What does it want
from this person?

09:55.115 --> 09:56.280
Death.

10:16.870 --> 10:19.400
So, Don, I was talking
to your wife Karen,

10:19.435 --> 10:20.735
and she's concerned about

10:20.770 --> 10:22.510
her daughter coming to live
with the kids.

10:22.545 --> 10:24.070
Yeah. I'm concerned, too.

10:24.080 --> 10:26.010
I mean, I don't want them
in here

10:26.045 --> 10:27.640
if it's not safe for them.

10:27.650 --> 10:29.210
Now as far as
your own experiences,

10:29.245 --> 10:30.510
can you tell me about any?

10:30.520 --> 10:32.700
Yeah. I see shadow figures
all the time.

10:32.735 --> 10:34.880
Karen mentioned
the same thing to me.

10:34.890 --> 10:36.890
Okay, so how often are you
seeing these shadows?

10:36.925 --> 10:38.655
Daily basis.

10:38.690 --> 10:40.040
All right, Don,
anything else?

10:40.075 --> 10:41.390
Yeah, in the downstairs
bathroom,

10:41.425 --> 10:43.425
I would get pushed

10:43.460 --> 10:45.800
almost every time
I took a shower.

10:45.835 --> 10:47.160
I know you had a stroke.

10:47.170 --> 10:48.770
Could it be a side effect
from some of the medications

10:48.805 --> 10:49.935
you're taking?
No.

10:49.970 --> 10:53.740
I'm down to only
blood pressure medications now.

10:53.775 --> 10:55.370
All right, Don,
anything else?

10:55.405 --> 10:56.675
I was downstairs,

10:56.710 --> 10:59.430
and I heard Karen crying
uncontrollably upstairs,

10:59.465 --> 11:02.150
so I'm running upstairs
to see what was wrong.

11:02.185 --> 11:04.315
And when I got there,
she was just fine

11:04.350 --> 11:07.820
and said that she hadn't been
crying, that she was quiet.

11:07.855 --> 11:09.890
All right. What about a TV
or a radio being on?

11:09.925 --> 11:11.255
No. It wasn't on.

11:11.290 --> 11:13.055
Okay, mow did you ever
hear that again?

11:13.090 --> 11:16.090
Yeah. It actually happened
the other way around after that.

11:16.125 --> 11:17.690
- She heard you?
- Yes.

11:17.700 --> 11:20.100
Karen said that
she heard me screaming

11:20.135 --> 11:21.765
like something
was really wrong,

11:21.800 --> 11:24.030
that I was pissed off
about something.

11:24.040 --> 11:26.570
Okay. You sure you weren't
going crazy and having a fit?

11:26.605 --> 11:28.400
No. I was folding laundry.

11:28.410 --> 11:30.210
All right, this is...
That's a little strange.

11:30.245 --> 11:32.780
- Yeah.
- Okay.

11:36.880 --> 11:41.780
The priest, who now
is claiming to be a demon,

11:41.790 --> 11:44.055
I think he can jump people.

11:44.090 --> 11:45.720
Like, the word,
the possession word,

11:45.755 --> 11:48.655
is being thrown around a lot.

11:49.578 --> 11:54.688
Living people see, like,
this pretty thick, black mist,

11:54.723 --> 11:56.523
and it's pretty tall.

11:56.558 --> 11:58.243
That's how he melds with people.

11:58.278 --> 11:59.893
Like, that's why
he's in that form,

11:59.928 --> 12:02.878
so he can meld easily
with people's bodies.

12:02.913 --> 12:05.870
The way that,
that would affect the living,

12:05.905 --> 12:08.828
I'm seeing, you know,
them acting crazy.

12:10.568 --> 12:11.903
And they wouldn't remember.

12:11.938 --> 12:15.108
Say they're eating,
and then all of a sudden,

12:15.143 --> 12:17.875
somebody jumps up
from the kitchen table

12:17.910 --> 12:20.479
and is like, "I'm gonna...
kill everyone!"

12:20.514 --> 12:23.048
That's this thing, like,
jumping them.

12:23.083 --> 12:25.883
It speaks through the living.

12:25.918 --> 12:28.088
So, Don, talking to Karen,
she also mentioned to me

12:28.123 --> 12:30.358
that you're having
mood swings.

12:30.393 --> 12:31.718
Your attitude has changed.

12:31.728 --> 12:34.988
What's the story there?

12:34.998 --> 12:36.593
I will, all of a sudden,

12:36.628 --> 12:38.858
get really frustrated
or get really mad,

12:38.868 --> 12:41.828
and I don't know why
I feel like that.

12:41.838 --> 12:43.933
It just hits me,
and I just...

12:43.968 --> 12:47.868
I'll get really mad
and frustrated out of the blue.

12:47.878 --> 12:50.473
Are you afraid
you might get physical?

12:50.508 --> 12:53.713
I'm just afraid that, yeah,
I'm gonna yell or scream

12:53.748 --> 12:56.918
or say something that's really
going to hurt somebody,

12:56.953 --> 12:59.413
and I don't mean it.
Okay.

12:59.448 --> 13:01.848
I mean, do you think Karen's
afraid of you when this happens?

13:01.858 --> 13:04.418
Well, she will tell me
sometimes, "You're yelling."

13:04.428 --> 13:06.258
And it's, "I'm not
trying to yell.

13:06.293 --> 13:08.088
I'm just trying to talk
to you."

13:08.098 --> 13:10.758
I want to do whatever it takes
to protect our family.

13:10.793 --> 13:12.380
- Okay.
- You know, this is something

13:12.415 --> 13:13.968
that I just can't fight
on my own.

13:14.003 --> 13:15.833
Okay.

13:15.868 --> 13:19.568
This priest-demon thing...

13:20.738 --> 13:26.173
...will go after the weak
and vulnerable.

13:26.208 --> 13:31.278
I think he's trying to do that
with somebody at this location.

13:31.288 --> 13:36.118
There's something about this
place that attracts bad things.

13:43.028 --> 13:44.698
Karen told me
her daughter Valerie plans

13:44.733 --> 13:46.063
on moving into the house
with her kids.

13:46.098 --> 13:48.868
Now she's not in state,
so I'm reaching out to her

13:48.903 --> 13:51.603
on video chat to see
if she's had any experiences.

13:51.638 --> 13:54.568
So, Val, I got to tell you, I've
been talking to your parents,

13:54.578 --> 13:56.268
and I'm not sure
it's such a good idea

13:56.278 --> 13:58.438
for you to move in here
with the kids.

13:58.448 --> 13:59.843
I mean, how you feel
about that?

13:59.878 --> 14:02.608
<i> It is very concerning.</i>
<i> My mom is allowing us</i>

14:02.618 --> 14:04.878
<i> to come in and get back</i>
<i> on our feet</i>

14:04.888 --> 14:08.448
<i> after a divorce and try</i>
<i> to reestablish ourselves.</i>

14:08.458 --> 14:10.323
<i> But if things can't</i>
<i> get figured out,</i>

14:10.358 --> 14:13.058
<i> I may have to find</i>
<i> a different living situation.</i>

14:13.093 --> 14:16.963
So have you visited
the house here in Arizona?

14:16.998 --> 14:19.628
<i> Yes, actually. I have</i>
<i> been there multiple times.</i>

14:19.663 --> 14:22.733
When you were here,
did you have any experiences?

14:22.768 --> 14:26.668
<i> Yeah. I've experienced</i>
<i> a shadow a couple of times.</i>

14:26.703 --> 14:28.808
Okay. It seems everybody's
seen shadows here.

14:28.843 --> 14:30.243
How did you experience it?

14:30.278 --> 14:32.908
<i> I was sitting on the love seat</i>
<i> in the living room,</i>

14:32.943 --> 14:35.513
<i> and off to my right-hand side,</i>

14:35.548 --> 14:38.548
<i> there was a shadow</i>
<i> that would walk in front of it</i>

14:38.583 --> 14:41.288
<i> and block the reflection.</i>

14:41.323 --> 14:42.783
All right. Anything else?

14:42.818 --> 14:45.118
<i> I've had feelings</i>
<i> of being watched.</i>

14:45.128 --> 14:47.128
Now was that in anyplace
specific in the house?

14:47.163 --> 14:50.063
<i> Mainly downstairs.</i>

14:50.098 --> 14:52.913
<i> It just felt like somebody</i>
<i> was in the room watching me.</i>

14:52.948 --> 14:55.728
<i> I would feel like I was going</i>
<i> to have a panic attack.</i>

14:55.738 --> 14:57.903
You got to be concerned
about yourself

14:57.938 --> 15:00.133
and the kids at this point,
if they do come here.

15:00.168 --> 15:04.008
<i> I'm afraid that, with</i>
<i> the children being so young,</i>

15:04.043 --> 15:07.848
<i> that they may be vulnerable</i>
<i> to attacks on themself.</i>

15:10.378 --> 15:13.548
My feeling, at this point,

15:13.583 --> 15:16.718
about the priest/demon thing

15:16.753 --> 15:19.993
is that it was a human.

15:20.028 --> 15:22.813
And this person was religious.

15:22.848 --> 15:25.563
And I don't think they look like

15:25.598 --> 15:29.768
how they presented themselves
to me at any time.

15:29.803 --> 15:33.098
This priest-demon guy
is going nuts.

15:34.338 --> 15:36.838
He's like, "Get out of here.
I own this."

15:36.873 --> 15:38.773
Like, "Get the...out of here,

15:38.808 --> 15:40.578
or I'm gonna, like,
kill everybody."

15:54.828 --> 15:57.328
So I made my usual calls
when I got into town,

15:57.363 --> 15:59.058
and a local journalist
just called back

15:59.068 --> 16:01.953
and said he's got something
that's going to help me out.

16:01.988 --> 16:04.838
Apparently, a hotel owner got
lost wandering in the desert

16:04.873 --> 16:07.908
and ended up dying right on
Karen and Don's property.

16:15.348 --> 16:17.783
So, David, do me a favor.
Set the scene for me.

16:17.818 --> 16:20.218
When this guy wandered
onto my clients' property,

16:20.253 --> 16:22.953
when was this,
and who owned the property?

16:22.988 --> 16:25.158
Well, your clients' property
was part of a ranch owned

16:25.193 --> 16:27.453
by a man named
James Kilroy Brown.

16:27.488 --> 16:31.428
Brown had purchased
the property in 1877

16:31.463 --> 16:34.068
and named it
the Sahuarito Ranch.

16:34.103 --> 16:35.263
All right.

16:35.298 --> 16:37.583
Over time, the ranch grew
to about 4,000 acres.

16:37.618 --> 16:39.868
All right, so now this guy
has got 4,000 acres.

16:39.903 --> 16:41.003
But what's he do with it?

16:41.038 --> 16:43.603
Well, Brown fully utilized
his 4,000 acres

16:43.638 --> 16:47.243
as a cattle ranch as well
as, also, a stage stop.

16:47.278 --> 16:49.998
All right. So what can you tell
me about the guy that got lost?

16:50.033 --> 16:52.718
Well, the gentleman that got
lost, his name was James Dixon.

16:52.753 --> 16:55.553
He was a hotel owner
in Tucson.

16:55.588 --> 16:58.118
He invested in mines
in southern Arizona.

16:58.128 --> 17:02.793
On May 1, 1887, he decided to
take a wagon and a horse

17:02.828 --> 17:05.798
and head down towards his mines
to see how they were doing.

17:05.833 --> 17:08.768
And on the way down there,
he stops at the Sahuarito Ranch,

17:08.803 --> 17:11.385
just to water his horse
for a little bit,

17:11.420 --> 17:13.968
and then decides
to continue on going south.

17:14.002 --> 17:16.073
At that point,
he ends up getting lost.

17:16.108 --> 17:18.058
And if you look out here,
this is not a place

17:18.093 --> 17:20.008
you want to get lost
in the middle of summer.

17:20.042 --> 17:21.608
It's deadly.

17:21.617 --> 17:24.278
Well, eventually,
Brown gets wind of this

17:24.313 --> 17:25.413
and gathered together

17:25.448 --> 17:26.988
a bunch of the ranchers
in the area,

17:27.022 --> 17:28.720
and they formed a search party.

17:28.755 --> 17:30.418
It actually made
the local paper.

17:33.428 --> 17:35.288
Brown basically did
the right thing.

17:35.298 --> 17:36.923
He didn't have to look
for this guy.

17:36.958 --> 17:39.968
And they searched for days
and days, and eventually,

17:40.003 --> 17:44.438
they find Dixon lying
under a tree, half-naked.

17:44.473 --> 17:45.703
Now why would he do that?

17:45.738 --> 17:48.638
I think he went plumb crazy
wandering the desert.

17:48.673 --> 17:49.803
What did they do with him?

17:49.838 --> 17:52.073
Well, Brown takes him
back to the ranch,

17:52.108 --> 17:56.108
and Dixon dies on your clients'
property that night.

17:56.118 --> 17:58.083
Here's an article about that.

17:58.118 --> 18:01.648
Sadly, Dixon was
only 47 years old,

18:01.658 --> 18:04.188
and he had a wife and two
daughters he left behind.

18:04.223 --> 18:06.588
- That's a shame.
- Yeah.

18:09.428 --> 18:10.863
I'm seeing a church.

18:10.898 --> 18:13.968
I think it belongs
to the priest-demon guy.

18:14.003 --> 18:17.038
In the pews were
all of these dead people.

18:17.073 --> 18:19.933
They're freaked out,

18:19.968 --> 18:22.973
and they're trapped
in this space by the priest.

18:23.008 --> 18:25.978
But he ain't no priest.
He ain't no Catholic.

18:26.013 --> 18:29.208
He is a fake, false prophet.

18:30.918 --> 18:32.583
He'll kill 'em off

18:32.618 --> 18:35.848
and put 'em
into one of the pews.

18:40.728 --> 18:43.628
So far, I've got a couple
being tormented on a property

18:43.663 --> 18:45.563
where a lost traveler died,

18:45.598 --> 18:48.933
but I want to see
if there's anything else.

18:48.968 --> 18:51.368
Searching through old records,
I come across an article

18:51.403 --> 18:52.903
about a homeless Mexican man

18:52.938 --> 18:55.673
who was brutally murdered
back in 1893.

18:55.708 --> 18:58.393
It turns out
the homicide took place

18:58.428 --> 19:01.043
right next to
Karen and Don's property.

19:01.078 --> 19:03.678
I asked a local sergeant to look
into this murder for me,

19:03.713 --> 19:05.983
and he stumbled
onto a second homicide.

19:06.018 --> 19:08.548
It's a small town, so I'm
actually kind of surprised,

19:08.558 --> 19:11.418
but hopefully, one of these
will help my case.

19:18.358 --> 19:19.913
So, Mike, thanks
for meeting with me.

19:19.948 --> 19:21.468
The homicide I found,
what were you able

19:21.503 --> 19:22.898
to find out
about the victim?

19:22.933 --> 19:24.303
We don't know a lot.

19:24.338 --> 19:25.798
We know that he's homeless
and his name is Pancho Mendozo.

19:25.808 --> 19:27.338
How's he wind up
getting murdered?

19:27.373 --> 19:29.273
On October 13, 1893,

19:29.308 --> 19:33.708
he was passing by
the James Kilroy Brown Ranch,

19:33.743 --> 19:36.113
which is now
your clients' property,

19:36.148 --> 19:38.533
and I guess he got tired
and he got hot, and he decided

19:38.568 --> 19:40.918
he was going to lay down
underneath a mesquite tree

19:40.953 --> 19:42.548
and take a nap.

19:42.558 --> 19:44.258
While he's doing that, he's not
aware that he's being followed,

19:44.293 --> 19:46.358
but what happens is,
is that the murderer came up

19:46.393 --> 19:47.940
and caught him
while he was asleep

19:47.975 --> 19:49.488
and stabbed him
once in the throat

19:49.498 --> 19:51.558
and once in the right side
of the abdomen.

19:51.593 --> 19:53.558
He had died instantly.

19:53.568 --> 19:54.733
They ever make an arrest?

19:54.768 --> 19:56.568
The sheriff did make
an arrest.

19:56.603 --> 19:58.333
Did he get indicted,
convicted?

19:58.368 --> 20:01.233
No, there was no indictment.
They weren't convicted.

20:01.268 --> 20:03.953
There was -- The grand jury
could not agree on the charges.

20:03.988 --> 20:06.638
All right, so it's 1893.
You got a homeless Mexican guy.

20:06.648 --> 20:08.243
What did they do with
the body?

20:08.278 --> 20:09.513
At that time,
he didn't have any money,

20:09.548 --> 20:11.243
and he had no family,
nobody to claim the body,

20:11.278 --> 20:14.088
so they buried him very close
to exactly where he was killed,

20:14.123 --> 20:15.588
right near
your clients' property.

20:15.623 --> 20:16.783
- You're kidding me.
- No.

20:16.818 --> 20:18.388
That's just the way
they did it back then.

20:21.128 --> 20:23.588
There's this older drunk guy

20:23.598 --> 20:28.068
who looks like he was,
back in the day, from Mexico.

20:29.368 --> 20:30.803
I feel sick.

20:30.838 --> 20:33.423
And I'm feeling, like...pain,

20:33.458 --> 20:36.218
lots of pain all through here.

20:36.253 --> 20:38.765
I'm hearing all these noises.

20:38.800 --> 20:41.278
I was outside, and then "knife."

20:41.313 --> 20:43.913
I'm just hearing "knife."

20:43.948 --> 20:46.848
I don't know what that is.
And I hear, "Back away."

20:46.883 --> 20:49.748
All right, so, Mike,
you mentioned on the phone

20:49.758 --> 20:51.808
there was a second homicide
you found.
Correct.

20:51.843 --> 20:53.858
Okay, so what can you tell me
about the victim?

20:53.893 --> 20:56.728
The victim's name
is Glendell Soape.

20:56.763 --> 20:58.223
He's 25 years old.

20:58.258 --> 20:59.558
He's married
and has three kids,

20:59.568 --> 21:01.033
and he's from
Scottsdale, Arizona.

21:01.068 --> 21:03.128
All right, so I assume
he's down here on business.

21:03.138 --> 21:06.533
Well, actually,
on May 23, 1963,

21:06.568 --> 21:09.608
he went down
to a predominantly black bar

21:09.643 --> 21:11.903
looking for a prostitute,

21:11.938 --> 21:14.178
and goes up
to a perfect stranger,

21:14.213 --> 21:16.243
whose name is Leo Davis,

21:16.278 --> 21:19.218
and asked him if he can
hook him up with a black girl.

21:19.253 --> 21:20.818
- And does he get hooked up?
- He did so.

21:20.853 --> 21:22.348
He went
and found one for him,

21:22.358 --> 21:25.408
and they went and had sex
outside of the bar.

21:25.443 --> 21:28.423
- Does the pros set him up?
- No, not at all.

21:28.458 --> 21:31.728
After they were done having sex,
he decides, all of a sudden,

21:31.763 --> 21:35.630
that he wants to go to Mexico
and get cheap liquor.

21:35.665 --> 21:39.498
So he jumps in the car
with his new friend, Leo Davis,

21:39.508 --> 21:41.973
and another guy
and the prostitute,

21:42.008 --> 21:44.643
and they all head
down the road for Mexico.

21:44.678 --> 21:47.278
Well, about a mile from
your clients' property,

21:47.313 --> 21:50.595
they pull off
the side of the road.

21:50.630 --> 21:53.878
So Davis slugs Mr. Soape
in the head,

21:53.888 --> 21:55.083
and then
they both grabbed him,

21:55.118 --> 21:56.888
pulled him out of the car,
killed him,

21:56.923 --> 21:59.153
and take his watch
and $600.

21:59.188 --> 22:02.488
And I have his certificate
of death right here.

22:02.498 --> 22:05.658
Cause of death was
listed as a broken neck.

22:05.668 --> 22:06.958
So did this guy Davis

22:06.968 --> 22:08.528
or anybody else
get arrested for this?

22:08.563 --> 22:09.828
Yes. They did.

22:09.838 --> 22:11.638
A couple months later,
the prostitute gave up both men.

22:11.673 --> 22:14.273
Here's the article.

22:14.308 --> 22:15.858
They were convicted,
and both of them

22:15.893 --> 22:17.408
were sentenced
to life in prison.

22:20.948 --> 22:24.718
When I walked out here,
I was seeing, like,

22:24.753 --> 22:25.983
a guy,

22:26.018 --> 22:28.253
and I was seeing, like,

22:28.288 --> 22:30.583
him feeling
like he was burning.

22:30.618 --> 22:35.058
Like, it literally felt
like fire, like, on the inside.

22:35.093 --> 22:37.323
All of a sudden,
he's like, "...!"

22:37.358 --> 22:40.558
Like, somebody's, like,
kicking him in the shins,

22:40.568 --> 22:43.468
and then he's feeling hit
in the back here.

22:43.503 --> 22:45.063
You know what I mean?

22:45.098 --> 22:47.468
And then he's on the ground.

22:47.503 --> 22:49.008
Very scary.

23:14.988 --> 23:16.653
Look, it's Arizona,
so obviously,

23:16.688 --> 23:19.173
there's gonna be a lot
of Native American history.

23:19.208 --> 23:21.623
But I just got off the phone
with local historian

23:21.658 --> 23:24.998
who says a tribe that lived
where Don and Karen's house sits

23:25.033 --> 23:28.163
was involved
in a horrific massacre.

23:28.198 --> 23:31.198
I'm driving over now to
find out exactly what happened.

23:37.838 --> 23:39.508
So, Bridgette, before we get
to the massacre

23:39.543 --> 23:40.943
you told me about
on the phone,

23:40.978 --> 23:42.408
what can you tell me
about the tribe that lived

23:42.418 --> 23:43.713
on my clients' property?

23:43.748 --> 23:45.383
The tribe was called
the Tohono O'odham,

23:45.418 --> 23:47.918
and they've been in this area
for hundreds of years.

23:47.953 --> 23:49.948
Here's a picture
that we have of them.

23:49.958 --> 23:51.483
And they actually are
still around.

23:51.518 --> 23:54.588
They have a large reservation
just west of here.

23:54.623 --> 23:57.028
So this big massacre,
who was involved?

23:57.063 --> 23:58.323
The massacre was between

23:58.358 --> 24:00.358
the Tohono O'odham
and the Apache.

24:00.368 --> 24:01.933
Okay. So now
what was the beef?

24:01.968 --> 24:05.968
Well, the Apache would come to
the Tohono O'odham settlements,

24:06.003 --> 24:08.103
and they would raid
and they would steal,

24:08.138 --> 24:10.768
and they would often kill a lot
of the Tohono O'odham people.

24:10.778 --> 24:11.973
Now did any of these attacks

24:12.008 --> 24:14.073
by the Apache happen
on my clients' property?

24:14.108 --> 24:16.348
We don't have any record
of them actually happening

24:16.383 --> 24:17.883
on your clients' property,

24:17.918 --> 24:19.478
but we're sure
they happened nearby.

24:19.488 --> 24:21.648
So, Bridgette, tell me
about the massacre.

24:21.683 --> 24:24.218
It started in
the spring of 1871.

24:24.253 --> 24:25.383
The Apaches surrendered

24:25.418 --> 24:27.923
to the American government
at Camp Grant,

24:27.958 --> 24:30.393
and these are some pictures
of Camp Grant.

24:30.428 --> 24:34.098
It's about 60 miles north
from your clients' property.

24:34.133 --> 24:36.068
Okay, so it's north up here.

24:36.103 --> 24:37.428
Okay. So what happened?

24:37.438 --> 24:40.098
The Tohono O'odham saw
an opportunity to attack,

24:40.108 --> 24:41.908
so they traveled 2 days.
- Okay.

24:41.943 --> 24:43.673
And they go up to
Camp Grant.

24:43.708 --> 24:48.308
On April 30, 1871, at dawn,
they attacked.

24:48.343 --> 24:49.843
144 people died,

24:49.878 --> 24:52.513
and 136 of those
were women and children.

24:52.548 --> 24:54.848
All right. So all these people
dead. Did anybody survive?

24:54.883 --> 24:56.053
They take any prisoners?

24:56.088 --> 24:58.188
There were 30 children
that did survive,

24:58.223 --> 24:59.753
and they were sold
into slavery,

24:59.788 --> 25:02.228
and they were marched down
into Sonora, Mexico.

25:02.263 --> 25:04.088
There's a road
that actually went

25:04.098 --> 25:05.863
right by
your clients' property.

25:05.898 --> 25:09.233
And a couple of them did
manage to escape.

25:09.268 --> 25:12.938
This is one that we know
for sure made it back,

25:12.973 --> 25:15.108
and as far as we know,
the rest of them

25:15.143 --> 25:16.873
died in slavery
down in Mexico.

25:16.908 --> 25:20.238
All right. So did anybody pay
for this massacre at all?

25:20.248 --> 25:24.048
The territory governor
arrested over 100 people,

25:24.083 --> 25:26.648
and when the verdict
went to the jury,

25:26.683 --> 25:27.783
they were all acquitted.

25:27.818 --> 25:30.748
Nobody got convicted
of anything?
No.

25:30.758 --> 25:32.458
The people of Pima County were
very supportive of the massacre,

25:32.493 --> 25:36.088
so the Apache
never saw justice.

25:44.268 --> 25:47.398
The Native Americans
cursed this land.

25:47.408 --> 25:52.308
That stems from way, way, way,
way, way, way, way,<i> way</i> back,

25:52.343 --> 25:55.078
from the murder and mayhem
that was committed.

25:56.918 --> 25:59.778
This was specific to this area.

25:59.788 --> 26:02.618
They were tying Native Americans

26:02.653 --> 26:04.618
that they had captured.

26:07.528 --> 26:11.163
These Native Americans
were slaves.

26:11.198 --> 26:14.398
I don't know exactly
what they were forced to do,

26:14.433 --> 26:17.533
but I just saw
the word "slaves."

26:17.568 --> 26:19.168
Is the priest
trapping them in the church

26:19.203 --> 26:22.008
with the other dead people?

26:22.043 --> 26:23.303
I think so. Yeah.

26:23.338 --> 26:26.338
Some of them were
pretty much skeletons

26:26.348 --> 26:28.408
with just, like, little bits
of flesh hanging off.

26:30.818 --> 26:36.288
So I'm estimating that there
were about 80 of these people.

26:36.323 --> 26:38.383
The ones who were
almost skeletons, I think,

26:38.418 --> 26:42.488
died at the same time,
so they're in a lot of pain.

26:49.598 --> 26:53.568
During my walk, I saw a whole
bunch of disturbing things,

26:53.603 --> 26:55.273
but two stood out.

26:55.308 --> 26:57.468
First,
the group of shadow figures

26:57.478 --> 26:59.043
marching through the house.

26:59.078 --> 27:03.348
What I saw in this hallway was,
in single file,

27:03.383 --> 27:06.548
shadow people,
and different heights.

27:09.988 --> 27:12.258
Next, I described
the priest-demon

27:12.293 --> 27:14.453
tormenting the living.

27:14.488 --> 27:18.328
You can see that he was
looking like a human

27:18.363 --> 27:22.165
and it stands by the bed

27:22.200 --> 27:25.933
and it becomes a thin mist

27:25.968 --> 27:29.708
and it covers the person
and then it meshes into them.

27:33.578 --> 27:36.348
Amy, is this what you saw?

27:36.383 --> 27:38.348
Yes.

27:57.238 --> 28:00.098
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

28:00.108 --> 28:02.538
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

28:02.573 --> 28:05.143
and our clients
for the first time.

28:05.178 --> 28:08.013
Well, Amy, I want you to meet
Karen and Don.

28:08.048 --> 28:10.843
They bought this house
about a year and a half ago,

28:10.878 --> 28:13.878
and they were hoping to make it
a dream retirement home.

28:13.888 --> 28:16.148
Obviously, that hasn't
worked out that way.

28:16.158 --> 28:19.718
But the main reason we're here
is Karen's daughter, Valerie.

28:19.728 --> 28:23.488
Now she's in a tough spot
and is supposed to move in here

28:23.498 --> 28:25.428
with her two daughters.
Next month?

28:25.463 --> 28:26.858
- Yeah.
- Okay.

28:26.868 --> 28:28.928
The problem is, these guys
don't think it's safe,

28:28.963 --> 28:32.938
so I'll ask Amy to describe
her walk for us.

28:35.208 --> 28:38.808
When I first arrived,
and I saw murder and mayhem

28:38.843 --> 28:41.543
that happened here
a long, long time ago.

28:41.578 --> 28:45.178
It involved Native Americans
who had ties to the land.

28:45.213 --> 28:48.613
They were being utilized
as slaves.

28:48.648 --> 28:52.618
The other thing is that there
was a curse placed on this land

28:52.628 --> 28:54.853
a very long time ago.

28:54.888 --> 28:57.358
I got something with slaves
when I did the research.

28:57.393 --> 28:59.660
It was an Indian tribe
called the Tohono O'odham...

28:59.695 --> 29:01.928
Okay.
...who lived
in and around your property

29:01.963 --> 29:03.863
for hundreds of years.

29:03.898 --> 29:06.138
Now I actually have a photo
of what they had looked like

29:06.173 --> 29:08.308
back in the 1850s.

29:10.478 --> 29:13.678
But there was bad blood
between them and the Apaches.

29:13.713 --> 29:16.108
They took abuse
from the Apaches for years.

29:16.118 --> 29:19.518
Now in 1871, the Tohono O'odham
got their revenge.

29:19.553 --> 29:20.583
The Apaches surrendered

29:20.618 --> 29:22.503
to the U.S. government
at Camp Grant,

29:22.538 --> 29:24.388
which is about 60 miles north
of here.

29:24.423 --> 29:27.818
Here's a picture of Camp Grant.

29:27.828 --> 29:32.423
On April 28, 1871,
the local tribe headed north

29:32.458 --> 29:35.468
and surrounded the camp,
and it turned into a bloodbath.

29:35.503 --> 29:39.938
By the end of it,
144 people were killed.

29:39.973 --> 29:42.838
136 of them
were women and children.

29:42.873 --> 29:45.143
Wow.

29:45.178 --> 29:48.713
Now about 30 of these Apache
kids survived the massacre,

29:48.748 --> 29:52.248
but they marched them
down past here into Mexico...

29:52.283 --> 29:54.578
...to sell them off
into slavery.

29:54.588 --> 29:57.788
And I actually have a picture
of one of the Native Americans

29:57.823 --> 29:59.888
that we know escaped.

30:03.758 --> 30:05.198
My god. I've seen her.

30:06.528 --> 30:08.893
I've seen her.

30:08.928 --> 30:11.313
When I close my eyes
at night, I-I see...

30:11.348 --> 30:13.698
- Here, sweetie. Take that.
- ...I see people.

30:18.308 --> 30:21.813
I just hope
she's okay somewhere.

30:21.848 --> 30:25.778
I'll just put this picture here.
It seems to be upsetting you.

30:25.813 --> 30:27.148
You think this could have
something to do

30:27.183 --> 30:30.153
with the curse on the land?
Yes.

30:30.188 --> 30:34.858
Essentially, the curse
is that anyone who's white

30:34.893 --> 30:38.598
will not live
a peaceful life here.

30:41.668 --> 30:43.863
So what else happened
on the walk?

30:43.898 --> 30:46.738
So I came inside,
and I was pulled immediately

30:46.773 --> 30:48.873
to the downstairs hallway.

30:48.908 --> 30:52.178
And I was then
in a male's body,

30:52.213 --> 30:55.973
and he was in a lot of pain,

30:56.008 --> 30:59.518
and I started to hear
all of these noises around him.

30:59.553 --> 31:01.283
So we're outside,

31:01.318 --> 31:05.283
and I felt like I was being
stabbed in my side.

31:05.318 --> 31:09.758
And I, of course, felt very ill,
and I didn't really understand

31:09.793 --> 31:11.723
what the hell was happening,

31:11.758 --> 31:13.863
and then I heard
the word "knife."

31:13.898 --> 31:15.598
So, Amy, that's not much
to go on,

31:15.633 --> 31:17.700
but it does sound
like a homicide

31:17.735 --> 31:19.733
I did come across
in my research.

31:19.768 --> 31:22.133
Now the victim's name
was Pancho Mendozo.

31:22.168 --> 31:24.468
We didn't know much about this
guy other than he was homeless,

31:24.478 --> 31:26.908
and he was about 55 to 60.

31:26.943 --> 31:28.843
On October 13, 1893,

31:28.878 --> 31:31.618
Mendozo was traveling
from Tucson to Mexico,

31:31.653 --> 31:33.678
passing right through
your property.

31:33.688 --> 31:37.018
So he was tired and decided to
take a little nap nearby a tree.

31:37.053 --> 31:39.788
It turns out he was
being followed.

31:39.823 --> 31:41.593
While Mendozo was sleeping,

31:41.628 --> 31:43.893
someone came up to him
and attacked him.

31:43.928 --> 31:47.358
He was stabbed twice, once in
the throat and in the torso.

31:48.628 --> 31:50.468
And he basically bled out
and died on the scene.

31:50.503 --> 31:52.468
To this day, the case
is still unsolved.

31:52.503 --> 31:53.833
Wow.

31:53.868 --> 31:55.968
This is the real kicker
of the whole thing --

31:56.003 --> 31:58.173
Mendozo had no family or money,

31:58.208 --> 32:00.108
and he was buried
right under the tree

32:00.143 --> 32:02.008
where they found him.
Interesting.

32:04.978 --> 32:07.778
So what else happened
on the walk?

32:07.788 --> 32:11.858
When I was outside,
I saw a lot of dead people

32:11.893 --> 32:14.218
walking in single file,

32:14.228 --> 32:17.888
and they're on
a specific pathway,

32:17.898 --> 32:20.558
and it goes right through
your house.

32:20.568 --> 32:23.028
Here I'm seeing four,
and here I'm seeing eight.

32:23.038 --> 32:26.998
At the same time, living people
would see them as shadow people.

32:27.008 --> 32:29.773
But they're not.
They're just dead people.

32:29.808 --> 32:32.058
- I refer to it as a parade...
- Yeah. Okay.

32:32.093 --> 32:34.308
...going through the house
this way.-

32:34.343 --> 32:37.878
And I'll see, like,
two, four, six.

32:37.913 --> 32:39.083
Crazy.

32:39.118 --> 32:40.853
It's like it's a constant,
daily...

32:40.888 --> 32:42.588
- Now you see them too, Don.
- Yeah.

32:42.623 --> 32:43.783
Interesting. Okay.

32:43.818 --> 32:46.418
When I spoke to Valerie
on a video conference,

32:46.428 --> 32:47.588
she described the same thing.

32:48.928 --> 32:52.558
I did have a sketch done
of what I was kind of seeing.

32:58.568 --> 33:00.538
Take a look at that.

33:00.573 --> 33:02.538
My god.

33:04.208 --> 33:05.708
And that's how it looks
to you, Karen?

33:05.743 --> 33:06.973
Yeah. Yeah.

33:07.008 --> 33:10.108
It's like wave after
wave after wave.

33:10.118 --> 33:12.078
Now you know you're not nuts.

33:12.113 --> 33:13.578
Thank you.

33:17.018 --> 33:19.018
All right,
so interesting walk so far.

33:19.053 --> 33:20.223
What else?

33:20.258 --> 33:24.123
So then I ran into

33:24.158 --> 33:26.663
an entity here that, to me,

33:26.698 --> 33:28.793
represents
the biggest problem.

33:28.828 --> 33:33.198
He's dressed like
a Catholic priest,

33:33.208 --> 33:36.473
but he's not really
a priest at all,

33:36.508 --> 33:39.458
but I couldn't figure out
if he was a demon

33:39.493 --> 33:42.408
or if, in fact,
he had once been human.

33:42.443 --> 33:43.478
So what was he?

33:43.513 --> 33:45.543
A dead person.

33:45.578 --> 33:49.488
And he started, like,
swearing and cursing at me,

33:49.523 --> 33:52.205
being very threatening
and saying

33:52.240 --> 33:54.888
that he was going
to kill all of us.

33:56.528 --> 33:59.298
When I met him,
he's in a church,

33:59.333 --> 34:03.328
and in his church,

34:03.338 --> 34:07.303
he has a lot of dead people.

34:07.338 --> 34:11.842
So his thing is he is
collecting all of these people

34:11.878 --> 34:16.348
and brings them into this church
that he's created,

34:16.382 --> 34:19.114
and he's trapping them there.

34:19.150 --> 34:21.813
So does this priest thing...

34:21.848 --> 34:24.253
Would it interact
with these guys?

34:24.288 --> 34:26.658
I think that it does have
the ability

34:26.693 --> 34:28.659
to go after you physically.

34:28.695 --> 34:30.592
I had an experience
last night

34:30.628 --> 34:33.428
where he was messing
with my throat,

34:33.463 --> 34:36.600
so I got these four lines,

34:36.635 --> 34:39.065
and it was burning
like a...

34:39.101 --> 34:41.498
- Yeah.
- That's you.

34:41.507 --> 34:43.458
That's me.

34:43.493 --> 34:45.373
I came home from work,

34:45.408 --> 34:49.108
and within just a couple minutes
of walking in the door,

34:49.143 --> 34:52.277
my leg starting burning
like a chemical burn.

34:52.313 --> 34:54.013
I looked down,

34:54.047 --> 34:58.318
and I had three scratches
right up the calf.

34:58.353 --> 35:00.418
He likes to go after
the weak and sick

35:00.428 --> 35:02.393
din this house specifically.

35:02.428 --> 35:03.978
That's easy prey for him.

35:04.013 --> 35:05.493
I did feel that there was

35:05.528 --> 35:07.798
a living individual
in this house

35:07.833 --> 35:10.033
that had become
a target for him

35:10.068 --> 35:14.053
and that this thing
is making this person sicker.

35:14.088 --> 35:18.038
I had a stroke 6 years ago,
and I've had, you know,

35:18.073 --> 35:19.738
ongoing blood-pressure issues.

35:21.508 --> 35:24.408
I got specific illness traits
of terrible headaches,

35:24.418 --> 35:27.213
nausea, and insomnia,

35:27.248 --> 35:30.748
and essentially, what he's doing
is torturing the person.

35:30.758 --> 35:33.458
I've been put on
a sleeping pill.

35:33.493 --> 35:34.453
Tell her about the headaches,

35:34.488 --> 35:35.788
the way you described them
to me.

35:35.823 --> 35:38.493
I get these intense...

35:38.528 --> 35:42.028
It's almost like a fire prod

35:42.063 --> 35:45.263
being put in your head.

35:45.298 --> 35:47.198
Now is he targeting
both of them?

35:49.238 --> 35:53.338
Well, I think that
it's mainly you,

35:53.348 --> 35:57.108
but it's not just
one person.

35:57.118 --> 35:58.348
The guy is into torture.

35:58.383 --> 35:59.483
- Yeah.
- You know?

35:59.518 --> 36:03.418
And the worst thing is that
he can jump people.

36:03.453 --> 36:07.318
He can make himself appear
like a black mist,

36:07.328 --> 36:10.493
and then he'll meld
into the person's body.

36:10.528 --> 36:14.163
This can cause mood swings,
and when he does that,

36:14.198 --> 36:17.798
he literally speaks through
the living in this house.

36:17.833 --> 36:21.298
And so I saw people
yelling out strange things.

36:21.308 --> 36:23.123
You know, you're
sitting at the table.

36:23.158 --> 36:24.938
You're eating, and then,
all of a sudden,

36:24.973 --> 36:26.203
somebody jumps up
and is like,

36:26.238 --> 36:29.378
"I'm gonna...kill everybody!"
just out of nowhere,

36:29.413 --> 36:32.518
and then has no recollection
that they did that.

36:32.553 --> 36:34.783
Yeah.
I was downstairs one day,

36:34.818 --> 36:38.088
and I heard Karen up here
crying uncontrollably,

36:38.123 --> 36:39.653
so I come running upstairs.

36:39.688 --> 36:42.258
She was sitting in the chair
and just said, "I was fine."

36:43.498 --> 36:46.158
And then, about a week
or two later, she goes,

36:46.193 --> 36:47.858
"I heard you
downstairs yelling and..."

36:47.868 --> 36:49.368
- Throwing a full tantrum.
- I said, "No."

36:49.403 --> 36:52.103
- Wow.
- I was fine.

36:52.138 --> 36:54.538
And you've got the mood swings
you were talking.

36:54.573 --> 36:57.005
Yeah. All of a sudden,
I'll get extremely frustrated

36:57.040 --> 36:59.709
to the point where, you know,
I almost start to vibrate,

36:59.744 --> 37:02.378
but then I just get pissed off
and I don't know why.

37:02.413 --> 37:05.378
His whole
speech mannerism changes.

37:06.518 --> 37:08.818
And it's like,
"Don, knock it off."
Yeah.

37:10.358 --> 37:13.023
Yeah. You okay? Yeah.

37:13.058 --> 37:14.718
It's tough to hear.
I know.

37:14.728 --> 37:16.488
- Yeah.
- You okay?

37:16.498 --> 37:18.723
It's okay.

37:18.758 --> 37:21.558
That's why
we're doing this.

37:21.568 --> 37:23.228
- Right?
- It's not you, Don.

37:23.238 --> 37:25.768
- Right.
- It's okay, man.

37:25.803 --> 37:28.298
It's okay.
We can get this fixed.

37:28.308 --> 37:31.973
You can be happy.

37:32.008 --> 37:35.408
Now this thing do anything else
besides torture these people?

37:35.443 --> 37:37.678
- Um...
- It's doing a good job of that.

37:37.713 --> 37:39.383
I was in the downstairs
basement,

37:39.418 --> 37:42.248
and I saw him standing
at the end of the bed.

37:42.283 --> 37:43.383
God.

37:43.418 --> 37:45.283
And then he became
that mist again,

37:45.318 --> 37:49.588
and he will sink
into the person's body.

37:49.623 --> 37:51.393
Obviously, this affects

37:51.428 --> 37:53.758
the living person's
body horribly.

37:56.368 --> 37:58.368
Gosh.

37:58.403 --> 38:00.533
Um...

38:00.568 --> 38:04.508
I had just gone to bed,
and I felt something

38:04.543 --> 38:06.938
from the foot of the bed,

38:06.948 --> 38:12.078
hand, knee, crawl
right over my body.

38:12.113 --> 38:13.413
You also had another experience

38:13.448 --> 38:14.748
where it felt like somebody
sat on the bed.

38:14.783 --> 38:16.113
Yes.

38:16.148 --> 38:20.488
I'll be laying in bed,
and you can feel somebody sit.

38:20.523 --> 38:22.853
The blankets tighten,

38:22.888 --> 38:27.558
and from my knees
to my feet got ice cold.

38:27.568 --> 38:31.568
I did have a sketch done
of that situation that I saw.

38:36.425 --> 38:41.143
Jeez.

38:41.178 --> 38:43.378
You guys have been through
a lot tonight. All right.

38:49.018 --> 38:51.848
My god.

38:55.428 --> 38:57.628
Valerie's bringing
her small kids here.

38:57.663 --> 38:59.423
Would they be in danger, too?

38:59.458 --> 39:02.798
Yes. Absolutely,
the children, yeah.

39:03.968 --> 39:06.398
That scares the hell
out of me.

39:11.978 --> 39:15.208
What the hell does this priest
thing want from these guys?

39:15.243 --> 39:17.608
His goal is to kill you guys,

39:17.618 --> 39:20.318
and it's definitely got you
in mind for his church.

39:36.528 --> 39:38.268
Well, Karen, you called us in
because you were worried

39:38.303 --> 39:40.503
about Valerie moving in
with the grandkids.

39:40.538 --> 39:45.278
Turns out bringing us in may
have saved you and Don's life.

39:45.313 --> 39:46.738
Now we're gonna answer
the big question.

39:46.748 --> 39:49.248
Can you kick this
priest-demon thing out,

39:49.283 --> 39:50.543
and what's it going to take?

39:50.578 --> 39:52.218
For that answer, I'm going
to turn it over to Amy.

39:55.888 --> 39:57.353
There are things you can do,

39:57.388 --> 40:00.423
but the thing you do need
to be aware of

40:00.458 --> 40:04.778
is that you will deal
with issues on a daily basis

40:04.813 --> 40:09.098
because of the area
and the curse that's here.

40:09.133 --> 40:11.328
So basically,
you'll never have peace

40:11.338 --> 40:14.838
like you've known prior
to moving to this place.

40:14.873 --> 40:17.755
So the first thing is
to bring a medium in

40:17.790 --> 40:20.638
and simply have them
help the stabbing victim

40:20.648 --> 40:23.508
and the group
of dead people move on.

40:23.518 --> 40:25.283
What I would like for you to do

40:25.318 --> 40:28.883
in dealing with
this priest dead guy

40:28.918 --> 40:32.173
is a true Catholic priest
needs to come in

40:32.208 --> 40:35.393
and do a blessing
at the property line.

40:35.428 --> 40:39.258
Then, using rosaries that have
been blessed by the same priest,

40:39.293 --> 40:40.893
so five rosaries,

40:40.928 --> 40:42.793
bury them at approximately

40:42.828 --> 40:45.498
the four corners
of your property

40:45.533 --> 40:47.398
and then place the fifth one

40:47.408 --> 40:49.673
in the approximate center
of the house.

40:49.708 --> 40:51.808
Now once they do all this,
will this priest-demon

40:51.843 --> 40:53.078
get the hell out of here?

40:53.113 --> 40:55.073
Correct.

40:55.108 --> 40:56.473
It won't be easy.

40:56.508 --> 40:58.863
But we need to do it,
and we're going to do it.

40:58.898 --> 41:01.183
You're worth it.
The grandkids are worth it.

41:01.218 --> 41:04.418
So now if they do everything
you told them they need to do,

41:04.453 --> 41:06.658
is Don going to feel better?

41:06.693 --> 41:08.375
I think you will.

41:08.410 --> 41:10.023
What about Karen?

41:10.058 --> 41:12.158
She'll be able to go to sleep,
no more of those big headaches?

41:12.193 --> 41:13.963
That'll be done.

41:13.998 --> 41:16.533
Maybe we can actually unpack,

41:16.568 --> 41:20.238
and you don't turn into
evil grandpa.

41:20.273 --> 41:21.733
Well, that's good.

41:21.768 --> 41:23.338
I'm glad to see smiles on your
faces at the end of all this.

41:23.373 --> 41:24.573
We can do it.

41:24.608 --> 41:25.808
We've been through a lot
of other worse stuff.

41:25.843 --> 41:27.578
There's a light at the end
of the tunnel.

41:30.008 --> 41:32.748
Karen and Don have a lot
of work ahead of them,

41:32.783 --> 41:35.488
but if they contact a medium
to remove the shadow people

41:35.523 --> 41:37.883
and the murder victim,
and a priest

41:37.918 --> 41:40.953
to set up a boundary
banishing the priest-demon,

41:40.988 --> 41:45.128
they can free themselves of evil
and lead a peaceful life.
