00:11.040 --> 00:12.490
What they got you for?

00:12.520 --> 00:14.950
I helped some people get some
medications they needed.

00:14.960 --> 00:17.420
Thanks for bailing me out. I'll make

00:17.440 --> 00:20.140

00:21.300 --> 00:22.090
Oh,my God.

00:22.110 --> 00:25.290
I got a little boyand a man with
extensive burns!

00:25.300 --> 00:28.120
- It started downstairs. - In my
apartment.

00:28.130 --> 00:31.510
I want you to put your hand in that
vise there.

00:31.530 --> 00:33.110
I want youto feel that.

00:36.180 --> 00:38.860
"Dying is Easy..."

00:43.960 --> 00:45.830
Plenty morewhere that came from.

00:46.830 --> 00:48.840
There we go. Here,come on.

00:48.850 --> 00:50.340
Come on,eat.

00:50.360 --> 00:53.290
I've been slaving over a hot griddle
all morning for you.

00:53.310 --> 00:55.320
Please,at leasttry it,okay?

00:55.340 --> 00:58.100
Here you go,there's a fork.

01:03.740 --> 01:05.830
- Satisfied? - No,I'm not,

01:05.840 --> 01:07.620
and I'm not goingto be satisfied until
I hear,

01:07.640 --> 01:10.390
"Wow,Tony,I can'tbelieve you made me
your world famous pancakes."

01:10.410 --> 01:13.950
Wow,Tony,I can't believe you made me
your world famous pancakes.

01:16.290 --> 01:18.650
All right,here'syour lunch. It's time
to go.

01:21.140 --> 01:23.640
Are kids gonna act weirdto me today?

01:23.660 --> 01:25.040
No.

01:27.040 --> 01:29.980
- I don't want to talk about Mom. - You
don't have to.

01:35.070 --> 01:37.640
Are you sending me to live with Grandma
and Grandpa?

01:38.660 --> 01:40.260
Why do you ask that?

01:40.270 --> 01:42.970
Isn't that what you were talking about
at the funeral?

01:42.980 --> 01:45.580
We were talking about a lot of things
at the funeral.

01:49.160 --> 01:51.280
I don't want to live with them.

01:52.440 --> 01:56.300
I want to stay here with you and your
crummy pancakes.

02:03.760 --> 02:05.440
- Bye. - Bye.

02:09.780 --> 02:12.020
X rays showyour lungs are improving.

02:12.040 --> 02:16.280
Oh,good.I need inhale

02:17.310 --> 02:20.730
Well,if your oxygenlevel stays up, you
can go home and ****.

02:20.740 --> 02:24.310
Tell Timmy. He's been worriedsick about
me.

02:25.080 --> 02:26.530
So has Alex.

02:27.970 --> 02:29.880
How is he?

02:29.890 --> 02:31.620
He's,uh...

02:32.190 --> 02:33.760
he's been acting weird.

02:35.430 --> 02:38.340
You think he did it,don't you?

02:41.030 --> 02:43.530
I know I blew outthose candles.

02:43.540 --> 02:46.630
I don't believe it. He's a good boy.

02:46.640 --> 02:50.680
You know,he's stealingDr. Morris'
credit card,he's disrespecting you.

02:50.700 --> 02:53.870
- I don't know what to think. - If he
did do it,

02:53.890 --> 02:56.840
I'm sure it wasn'ton purpose.

02:58.920 --> 03:02.390
Do you think Alex started that fire by
accident?

03:02.410 --> 03:06.250
I thinkyou should continue to take
himto that therapist lady.

03:06.270 --> 03:09.140
As far as the police go, they think it
was a candle.

03:09.160 --> 03:10.680
Let it go at that.

03:10.690 --> 03:12.400
Well,I'm glad tohear he's doing okay.

03:12.420 --> 03:15.470
Yeah,he just needed a little time for
the hand to heal.

03:15.480 --> 03:17.840
Look what we have here: not one but two
late doctors.

03:17.850 --> 03:18.900
The Blue Line was stuck.

03:18.910 --> 03:22.130
- Some bozo jumped infront of the
train. - Where's your main man?

03:22.140 --> 03:24.460
Um,he's gonna takeone more day.

03:24.470 --> 03:26.860
Yeah,no problem,I got it covered. Then
cover this.

03:26.870 --> 03:31.000
Some suit camefrom upstairsand said to
give that towho's ever running the
floor.

03:32.840 --> 03:35.190
- Damn. - Damn.

03:36.270 --> 03:37.600
Where's Pratt?

03:37.610 --> 03:40.810
- You suck balls! - Hold still,ma'am.

03:40.830 --> 03:43.540
- Hold still yourself,bitch! - Can we
giveBenzos IM?

03:43.550 --> 03:45.750
- That'll take a halfan hour to work. -
Okay.

03:45.760 --> 03:48.240
All right,I got access. What do you
want?Four Ativan?

03:48.250 --> 03:49.730
- Ativan? - Haldol?What?

03:49.750 --> 03:52.190
You're ruining my high,you retard!

03:52.200 --> 03:54.710
- Pratt,we need to talk. - Yeah,I'm a
littlebusy here,Morris.

03:54.720 --> 03:56.120
- Get me midazolam. - Okay.

03:56.130 --> 03:58.340
Faster onset,knock her downin less than
a minute.

03:58.350 --> 04:01.020
- Can we,uh,step outside,Greg? -
Yeah,sure,soon as shesettles
down,Morris.

04:01.030 --> 04:03.280
- Settle on this! - Watch out!

04:03.290 --> 04:05.130
Pratt,I-I'm,I'm really sorry, but I'm
gonna have to...

04:05.150 --> 04:06.840
You're gonna haveto wait,Morris.
Please,one minute.

04:06.850 --> 04:08.830
- Let go of me! - Pratt.

04:08.840 --> 04:10.270
- You scum of the earth. - Pratt!

04:10.290 --> 04:11.120
What?!

04:11.670 --> 04:14.960
The Medical Boardsuspended your
license.

04:21.360 --> 04:23.400
ER Season 13 Episode 15

04:26.510 --> 04:29.240
Hey,uh,can we talk?

04:29.260 --> 04:31.200
Yeah,sure,whatcan I do for you?

04:31.580 --> 04:33.650
I was Pratt's accomplice.

04:33.670 --> 04:37.790
- Excuse me? - I,I helped himat the
clinic.

04:38.820 --> 04:40.720
- What? - I know,I know.

04:40.730 --> 04:44.800
It seemed like the right thingto do at
the time.

04:44.810 --> 04:46.570
I can't believe this.

04:46.580 --> 04:51.210
Look,I told Pratt that hedidn't have to
protect me, but he wants meto stay out
of it.

04:51.230 --> 04:53.170
Well,listen to Pratt.

04:54.150 --> 04:56.970
- I'm gonna burn in hell,aren't I? -
No.

04:56.990 --> 04:59.550
I mean,you might havesome explaining to
do.

05:03.460 --> 05:05.460
Hey,I'm sorryabout this,man.

05:06.340 --> 05:08.660
I thought I could at least work half a
shift before the hearing.

05:08.670 --> 05:10.990
Well,it's just a formality. They'll
reinstate you.

05:11.010 --> 05:14.090
GI bleeds from NSAIDs happen to
thousands every year.

05:14.110 --> 05:17.950
Morris,Abby's asking for you. Her guy
in Oneis throwing up.

05:18.310 --> 05:21.270
Be strong,brother. Fight the power.

05:23.960 --> 05:25.940
- A liter wide open? - Yeah,and ten of
reglan.

05:25.950 --> 05:28.090
Okay,does it hurt here?

05:29.060 --> 05:33.920
No,but if youtug on Willie, I'll sing
DionneWarwick's greatest hits.

05:33.930 --> 05:35.880
- Tempting,but no thanks. -
No,really,I...

05:35.890 --> 05:39.820
I thought that's whyyou put the gloves
on.

05:39.850 --> 05:42.340
Seriously,I havea latex fetish.

05:42.350 --> 05:45.940
I even tried to give myself a
Brazilianusing rubbercement once.

05:45.950 --> 05:49.390
Didn't work,butI got into Hustleras one
of those guys whohas the three,uh...

05:49.400 --> 05:51.960
- All right,I get it,yeah. - Ever
hadfood poisoning?

05:51.980 --> 05:55.390
I puked once after biting into a Red
Hot with stretch marks.

05:56.090 --> 06:00.700
Okay,uh...we have to run some tests to
rule out anything seriouslike
appendicitis,

06:00.710 --> 06:03.070
but after that,hopefullywe can
discharge you.

06:03.080 --> 06:04.170
What's up with this guy?

06:04.180 --> 06:07.050
Vomiting,low-grade fever,exam is
equivocal.

06:07.060 --> 06:10.790
Doc,Doc...You gotta get meout of
here,man.

06:10.800 --> 06:12.410
I got a hot date tonight.

06:12.430 --> 06:14.860
Does,uh,she take air or helium?

06:15.440 --> 06:18.690
She takes Visa,but that was funny.

06:18.700 --> 06:20.960
- Can I use it? - Sure.

06:20.970 --> 06:22.270
Do you want meto image the belly?

06:22.280 --> 06:24.270
No,hydrate him. He may spiff up.

06:24.280 --> 06:26.370
Uh,four of morphine,antiemetics.

06:26.380 --> 06:28.370
We'll get you out of here. Just sit
tight.

06:28.380 --> 06:30.580
Okay,you're aboutto meet the Grassos.

06:30.590 --> 06:33.370
She's been on dialysissince 2002.

06:33.380 --> 06:35.340
He's got a kidney,but they don't match.

06:35.350 --> 06:37.700
And our exchange pool pairedthem up
with two cousins

06:37.710 --> 06:39.410
who are in exactlythe same situation.

06:39.430 --> 06:41.610
Yup. Kidneys for everyone.

06:43.990 --> 06:46.920
Hi. You guys set?

06:46.930 --> 06:48.320
You bet.

06:48.340 --> 06:51.490
No more dialysis,no more infected
shunts.

06:51.510 --> 06:54.310
This is Dr. Rasgotra. She's going to be
assistingon the transplant.

06:54.330 --> 06:55.060
I am?

06:55.070 --> 06:57.860
Ah,well,someone's about to getsome A-1
kidney meat.

06:57.870 --> 07:01.150
I'm like a,I'm like a racehorse. I can
drink a six-packwithout even peeg.

07:01.170 --> 07:02.160
Honey,gross.

07:02.170 --> 07:05.820
Actually,micturition capacity is
related to bladder sizeand neural
sensitivity,

07:05.830 --> 07:07.090
not renal function.

07:07.110 --> 07:09.200
Th,we'll give 'emsome bladder,too.

07:09.220 --> 07:11.090
Okay,I'll see what I can do.

07:11.110 --> 07:13.660
Do you guys have any questions?
Concerns?

07:13.670 --> 07:16.730
No?Okay,I'll see you in the O.R.

07:19.080 --> 07:21.920
Our goal is to enroll 200
donor-recipient pairs.

07:21.940 --> 07:25.230
By mixing and matching, we'd find
kidneysfor almost 50% of them.

07:25.250 --> 07:27.790
Yeah,I'll introduce youto the Herrero
cousins. They're rightwn the hail.

07:27.810 --> 07:30.800
So Marina's gettg akidney from one
cousin and Thomas is givinghis to the
other.

07:30.810 --> 07:33.170
- Yep,kind oflike a kidney key party. -
Key party?

07:33.180 --> 07:36.460
Except the donorsand the recipients
aren't allowed to meet.That could get a
little messy.

07:36.480 --> 07:39.120
It's the E.R. I'll catch up to you.

07:39.440 --> 07:40.610
What's a key party?

07:40.620 --> 07:44.280
Oh,it's a little gimmickto help
swinging couplespick their partners.

07:44.760 --> 07:46.590
Forget it. Before your time.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.360
Sounds dirty.

07:49.610 --> 07:51.590
Jessie,come on,hold still.

07:51.920 --> 07:55.580
- If he's got lice,you're cutting his
hair. - I'm a doctor,not Vidal Sassoon.

07:55.600 --> 07:59.000
Abby,I need you. Funny boykeeps
throwing up.

07:59.020 --> 08:02.870
- Okay,Ray,you got this,right? -
Hey,n-n-no.Don't leave me here.Don't...

08:02.880 --> 08:03.980
Did you give himthe reglan?

08:04.000 --> 08:05.710
An hour ago. It should beworking by
now.

08:05.720 --> 08:09.160
It's probably justgastroenteritis, and
if your labs are okay,we'll get you
home.

08:09.170 --> 08:11.960
Ugh... forget home.

08:11.970 --> 08:16.370
I got a gig at 10:15. The big room at
Zanies.

08:16.390 --> 08:19.050
I've been trying to get in there for a
couple of years.

08:19.060 --> 08:21.750
- You're a comedian? - Aspiring.

08:21.760 --> 08:25.950
- You should aspirea little harder. -
Ah,a heckler.

08:25.960 --> 08:29.620
Don't make me goK-K-Kramer on yo ass.

08:31.530 --> 08:33.280
Yo,blondie, need to get violent.

08:36.360 --> 08:39.970
Ah... geez.May I?

08:42.179 --> 08:43.980

08:44.310 --> 08:45.900
Oh,my gosh.

08:45.920 --> 08:48.330
I got to practice my routine.

08:48.350 --> 08:50.760
I got to change my clothes.

08:50.770 --> 08:53.790
I was going to wear this shirt, but now
I got chow meinall over it.

08:56.640 --> 08:58.420
How long you beendoing stand-up?

08:58.820 --> 09:01.560

09:01.580 --> 09:05.090
Very courageous. Yeah,my old boss
pushed meinto it.

09:05.660 --> 09:09.310

09:09.630 --> 09:13.820
'Cause he fired me twice,hated my guts.

09:15.310 --> 09:18.020
My dad ao had a lotto do with it.

09:18.040 --> 09:23.850
- He hated you,too? - No,he died.

09:25.290 --> 09:27.740
Life took ona whole new perspective.

09:28.260 --> 09:32.340
All right,I'm gonna call the lab,try
