WEBVTT

00:06.806 --> 00:07.830
Previously on Sanctuary...

00:10.477 --> 00:12.843
There's only one reason
you would've taken this risk -

00:12.946 --> 00:13.674
to risk her.

00:13.780 --> 00:15.509
Her life is in your hands, Helen.

00:15.615 --> 00:17.344
I don't think you want to lose her
over something

00:17.450 --> 00:19.782
as easily accessible
as your own blood.

00:19.886 --> 00:22.753
The Cabal started
infiltrating businesses,

00:22.856 --> 00:25.848
military think-tanks-
all under their control.

00:26.126 --> 00:27.115
Holy crap.

00:27.227 --> 00:30.594
Yeah. I mean, these guys
are one James Bond film away

00:30.697 --> 00:32.357
from global domination.

00:32.564 --> 00:34.624
- So, stealing their property-
- No, no, no, no.

00:34.734 --> 00:35.826
Would not go over well.

00:35.935 --> 00:38.665
I'd be careful
what you do next.

00:38.772 --> 00:40.740
The people I work for
aren't the forgiving type.

00:41.441 --> 00:44.171
The Five...

00:44.277 --> 00:47.144
...will come...

00:53.153 --> 00:55.644
This case study shows
an enlarged hypothalamus-

00:55.755 --> 00:58.451
nearly twice the size
of a normal human.

00:58.558 --> 00:59.786
Such increased scale

00:59.893 --> 01:02.828
is often the first indicator
of abnormal abilities,

01:02.929 --> 01:04.726
which is why
detailed brain-mapping

01:04.831 --> 01:08.494
is often our best recourse
when diagnosing new patients.

01:09.269 --> 01:10.531
And now, in this situation,

01:10.637 --> 01:12.764
the patient was able
to lower her body temperature

01:13.006 --> 01:16.567
to well below life-sustaining levels
for days at a time.

01:18.845 --> 01:21.780
Such examples
of this simple genetic mutation

01:21.981 --> 01:25.314
are part of a larger-scale trend
we're seeing worldwide.

01:25.418 --> 01:28.216
More appearances
of extraordinary genetic abilities

01:28.321 --> 01:30.289
are cropping up
at an ever-increasing rate-

01:30.390 --> 01:32.517
Excuse me.

01:34.661 --> 01:36.390
Grazie.

01:38.000 --> 01:44.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

01:46.506 --> 01:47.803
Mi scusi.

01:48.274 --> 01:49.901
An urgent matter has come up.

01:50.009 --> 01:51.943
Can we take a short recess?

01:52.045 --> 01:53.444
Fare una breve pausa?

02:07.193 --> 02:09.127
Helen Magnus.

02:10.395 --> 02:12.261
Kiss me, and I'll save your life.

02:12.866 --> 02:14.891
- And if I don't?
- Aw...

02:15.001 --> 02:17.595
It's been over 60 years.
Just plant one on me already.

02:21.808 --> 02:23.036
Nikola Tesla.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.169
You always did know
how to get attention.

02:26.279 --> 02:29.009
And you're still boring as ever
when it comes to giving a lecture.

02:29.115 --> 02:29.877
But, to business -

02:29.983 --> 02:31.473
Cabal agents
are all over the building.

02:31.584 --> 02:34.747
If we don't leave now, things
are going to get rather bullet-ridden.

02:34.854 --> 02:37.254
And why should I believe you?

02:37.957 --> 02:40.255
I assume you have a plan,
other than kissing me?

02:40.360 --> 02:42.260
Genius, remember?

02:48.835 --> 02:50.632
Beauty before brains.

02:58.678 --> 03:00.612
Charming.
I know.

03:00.713 --> 03:04.342
It's part of a 200-year-old system
of catacombs underneath the city.

03:04.450 --> 03:06.077
I'm assuming
there are other exits further on?

03:06.186 --> 03:07.847
Should be.
My contact said there would be.

03:07.954 --> 03:10.388
- Contact?
- Mm-hmm. Concierge at my hotel.

03:10.490 --> 03:11.582
Don't you love Rome?

03:19.165 --> 03:21.963
Get me thermal imaging
of these tunnels ASAP.

03:22.068 --> 03:24.559
Make sure
every possible exit is covered.

03:24.671 --> 03:27.037
They either surrender or they die.

04:01.941 --> 04:03.499
Hey, big man.

04:03.610 --> 04:06.078
Didn't we have a staff meeting
scheduled for this morning?

04:06.179 --> 04:08.113
It was canceled.

04:08.214 --> 04:11.240
- When?
- Last night.

04:11.351 --> 04:13.512
- Because?
- Ashley.

04:13.886 --> 04:14.875
Okay, look.

04:14.988 --> 04:16.148
Just because Magnus is away

04:16.255 --> 04:19.089
does not mean we stop
going about business as usual.

04:19.192 --> 04:20.591
I mean, she put me in charge,
and, you know,

04:20.692 --> 04:23.093
I want to take that very seriously.

04:23.196 --> 04:25.187
So, we've got patients to discuss,

04:25.298 --> 04:27.129
possible cases
that need investigating,

04:27.233 --> 04:29.701
and, you know,
other stuff that needs attention.

04:29.802 --> 04:31.531
Meetings are boring.

04:34.340 --> 04:35.739
Yeah.

04:35.842 --> 04:37.639
Yeah, they really are,
aren't they?

04:42.448 --> 04:44.575
Okay. I'm cool with that.
No meeting.

04:46.853 --> 04:48.047
So, uh...

04:49.122 --> 04:52.455
What do you guys do when you've
got the place to yourselves?

04:52.558 --> 04:54.423
Poker night?
Maybe a little blackjack?

04:54.527 --> 04:56.757
You blast some tunes
in the main library or something?

04:56.863 --> 04:59.354
Henry's in the lab,

04:59.465 --> 05:02.059
Squid requested
a meeting with Ashley,

05:02.168 --> 05:04.136
and I'm making things look nice.

05:08.541 --> 05:12.773
Perhaps you have some work
that needs attending to?

05:16.549 --> 05:17.811
What the hell was that?

05:17.917 --> 05:19.851
I don't know.

05:20.053 --> 05:21.680
Shall I look into it?

05:22.121 --> 05:23.179
If you don't mind,

05:23.289 --> 05:26.122
because I actually do have
some work I need to do.

05:35.702 --> 05:37.499
I'm not really
in charge here, am I?

05:44.143 --> 05:46.407
Right.

05:52.485 --> 05:53.474
Squid!

05:53.586 --> 05:55.383
Got you some treats.

05:55.488 --> 05:57.388
Gotta say, I was surprised
to get your message.

05:57.490 --> 06:01.221
I thought you said
you didn't have any info for me.

06:01.327 --> 06:03.124
Squid?

06:16.008 --> 06:18.203
You gotta be kidding me.

06:32.191 --> 06:35.319
Through here!

06:35.428 --> 06:37.396
Wow. They're really pissed at you.
What did you do?

06:37.497 --> 06:39.465
I stole three witches
from a crypt in Scotland.

06:39.565 --> 06:41.260
Stealing? You?
I'm appalled.

06:41.367 --> 06:42.459
Oh, shut up and help me.

06:42.568 --> 06:45.002
My God, you look sexy with a gun.

06:50.009 --> 06:52.239
TESLA
Leave her alone!

06:59.018 --> 07:00.952
Nikola, that's enough!

07:06.859 --> 07:09.919
Well, that was exciting, huh?

07:10.029 --> 07:11.621
A little too much so.

07:11.731 --> 07:13.426
You haven't stopped taking
your medication, have you?

07:13.533 --> 07:17.230
No, no, no. I just...
I just got a little excited.

07:18.538 --> 07:21.336
Come on, Helen.
I don't feed on humans.

07:21.441 --> 07:24.239
I made that vow long ago,
and I intend to keep it.

07:40.827 --> 07:42.158
Your favorite parlor trick.

07:42.261 --> 07:44.422
Ahem.
This way, my lady.

07:45.431 --> 07:47.422
You haven't lost your touch,
I'll give you that.

07:56.809 --> 07:58.276
Any idea
what could have done this?

07:58.377 --> 08:00.402
Many ideas.

08:00.513 --> 08:02.140
None that make sense.

08:02.248 --> 08:04.808
Yeah, I guess none of the abnormals
Magnus allows to roam free

08:04.917 --> 08:05.975
would do this.

08:06.085 --> 08:08.713
Not if they wish to remain free.

08:08.821 --> 08:10.755
Crap in a bag!
What the hell did that?

08:10.923 --> 08:13.721
Just asking
the same question.

08:13.826 --> 08:15.418
Scratch marks
on the floor and walls

08:15.528 --> 08:18.429
plus damage on the inside
to the electrical wiring.

08:18.531 --> 08:20.726
Whatever did this
took live voltage.

08:20.833 --> 08:23.028
Maybe it's lying in a corner
somewhere, licking its wounds?

08:23.135 --> 08:25.103
Problem is, there are
lots of corners in this place.

08:25.204 --> 08:26.899
All our residents accounted for?

08:27.006 --> 08:28.268
The security systems
would've gone off

08:28.374 --> 08:29.898
if something got free
from the shoe.

08:30.009 --> 08:31.704
Still, let's round up
all the abnormals that are free

08:31.811 --> 08:32.799
and interview them.

08:32.912 --> 08:35.573
I'll check security logs, see if
anything went goofy with the system.

08:35.681 --> 08:38.673
Okay, plus, if you have surveillance
camera footage for this floor,

08:38.784 --> 08:39.773
that'd be great.

08:39.885 --> 08:41.080
On it.

09:01.340 --> 09:02.068
Come on.

09:02.174 --> 09:03.937
There'll be more
where they came from.

09:04.043 --> 09:06.841
This is fun, isn't it?
Just like old times, back in London.

09:06.946 --> 09:08.846
When was that? '42? '43?

09:08.948 --> 09:10.438
I prefer not to think about it.

09:10.550 --> 09:11.642
Come on, Helen!

09:11.751 --> 09:14.811
Every major spy agency
in the world was looking for me.

09:14.921 --> 09:16.752
I needed your help.

09:16.856 --> 09:19.950
And, besides, what's a faked death
among friends?

09:20.059 --> 09:22.653
Whose hair-brained notion was it
to supply every allied government

09:22.762 --> 09:23.990
with plans
for your death-ray weapon?

09:25.064 --> 09:26.691
Well,
I thought they'd all share

09:26.799 --> 09:27.857
and that peace would break out.

09:27.967 --> 09:31.334
I did. I had my Nobel speech
all memorized.

09:35.641 --> 09:37.199
This sector's clear. Let's move on.

09:39.445 --> 09:42.243
How did you know
the Cabal were after me?

09:42.348 --> 09:45.181
I watch them,
and they watch me.

09:45.284 --> 09:47.013
We've had a few entanglements
over the years,

09:47.119 --> 09:49.178
but, you know, I've never
done anything so stupid

09:49.288 --> 09:51.222
as to actually steal from them.

09:51.324 --> 09:53.622
I've had my contacts
keeping an ear to the ground

09:53.726 --> 09:56.524
for any Cabal movements
since they attacked my Sanctuary.

09:56.629 --> 09:57.618
I would've known beforehand

09:57.730 --> 09:59.254
if they were going to make
a move on me here.

09:59.365 --> 10:01.162
In fact...

10:01.267 --> 10:04.828
...they didn't show up
until after you arrived.

10:05.037 --> 10:07.005
They're not after me, are they?

10:07.106 --> 10:09.074
They want you.

10:09.842 --> 10:13.801
You haven't lost your touch, either.

10:24.790 --> 10:27.418
Okay, you can come out and gloat
now, if you want. I'm awake.

10:28.861 --> 10:30.260
There'll be no gloating.

10:30.463 --> 10:35.332
I find that...
extremely ill-mannered.

10:35.434 --> 10:37.368
Well, what's your next move, then?

10:37.470 --> 10:39.529
You going to teleport me
to the top of the Eiffel Tower

10:39.639 --> 10:40.970
and leave me hanging
by my underpants?

10:42.108 --> 10:43.507
Or are you going to make it fast?

10:43.609 --> 10:45.133
Neither.

10:45.311 --> 10:46.778
Then what the hell
do you want from me?

10:46.879 --> 10:48.403
Honestly?

10:50.583 --> 10:51.948
I need your help.

10:52.118 --> 10:55.087
You have a kind of violent way
of asking for help, FYl.

10:56.922 --> 10:59.220
I wish you no harm.

10:59.325 --> 11:00.883
It was urgent that we speak.

11:00.993 --> 11:03.461
And I'm listening.
Let the insanity fly.

11:03.562 --> 11:05.427
Of course
that's what you'd think of me.

11:05.631 --> 11:08.498
That I am unstable, deranged.

11:08.601 --> 11:09.590
That's pretty much
what I call

11:09.702 --> 11:11.670
everybody who feeds me
to lizard creatures.

11:11.771 --> 11:13.295
But I can be
a bit harsh sometimes.

11:13.406 --> 11:19.709
Ashley, what happened before was...
deeply regrettable.

11:20.713 --> 11:25.275
I apologize for my actions,
without reservation.

11:25.384 --> 11:27.011
I can only ask
for your forgiveness.

11:27.953 --> 11:32.754
There are things you need to know...
about your mother.

11:33.893 --> 11:35.622
She's in grave danger.

11:35.795 --> 11:38.127
Dude, she's my mom.
She's always in grave danger.

11:38.230 --> 11:40.858
Please, Ashley!
There's little time.

11:40.966 --> 11:42.831
I need to know where she is.

11:42.935 --> 11:45.369
Me, handcuffed to a chair.

11:45.471 --> 11:49.100
You, babbling
about time and danger.

11:49.208 --> 11:50.140
No.

11:50.242 --> 11:51.732
I don't see why I should help you.

11:51.844 --> 11:54.278
I would like nothing more
than to free you...

11:56.082 --> 12:00.178
...but you would undoubtedly
try to kill me.

12:00.286 --> 12:01.378
Me?

12:03.456 --> 12:05.549
Did your mother not give you
some sort of explanation

12:05.658 --> 12:06.682
as to who I was?

12:06.892 --> 12:09.383
She told me you were someone
from her days back in London

12:09.495 --> 12:11.122
before she set up shop here.

12:12.932 --> 12:17.733
Oh! Oh, and that she was pretty
sure you'd never return because...

12:17.837 --> 12:19.134
...she'd killed you.

12:21.140 --> 12:22.971
Trust me,
I'll be speaking to her about that.

12:23.075 --> 12:24.770
Talk about a blown call.

12:24.877 --> 12:26.208
We don't have time for this.

12:26.312 --> 12:27.540
My sole purpose
in bringing you here

12:27.646 --> 12:30.547
is for your own benefit
as well as hers.

12:30.649 --> 12:32.708
You'll have to trust me.

12:39.925 --> 12:41.688
You've always been reckless,

12:41.794 --> 12:43.853
but contacting me directly
while the Cabal was following you-

12:43.963 --> 12:46.056
Oh, I know.
It's not one of my best ideas.

12:46.165 --> 12:47.928
But, hey, I had no choice.

12:48.033 --> 12:51.298
- I needed to see you.
- Then use the proper channels.

12:51.403 --> 12:54.270
Contact one of my facilities and
have them arrange a secure location.

12:54.373 --> 12:56.933
Would you rather have me endanger
one of your sanctuaries or just you?

12:57.042 --> 12:58.168
How about neither?

12:58.277 --> 12:59.972
Nicola, you dropped out of sight
before the end of World War II,

13:00.079 --> 13:01.341
never to be seen
or heard from again.

13:01.447 --> 13:04.541
Well, I did die a lonely,
impoverished, pitiful old man.

13:04.650 --> 13:06.709
Thanks for the funeral, by the way.
I heard it was quite nice.

13:06.886 --> 13:09.650
I faked your death to save your life,
so that your work could continue.

13:09.755 --> 13:12.121
I think I'm owed an explanation
as to your whereabouts since then.

13:12.258 --> 13:14.954
Hey, perfecting the use
of electricity and radio waves -

13:15.060 --> 13:16.925
hard acts to follow, okay?

13:17.029 --> 13:18.018
But I have kept busy.

13:18.230 --> 13:19.663
At Oxford, all those years ago,

13:19.765 --> 13:21.790
what we did was more
than just pushing boundaries.

13:21.901 --> 13:24.495
- For me, it was personal.
- As it was for all of us.

13:28.741 --> 13:30.675
You all changed,

13:30.776 --> 13:33.301
whereas I found out
who I really am.

13:33.412 --> 13:35.573
And the more I embrace that,

13:35.681 --> 13:38.514
the more I realize
just how little I've accomplished.

13:38.717 --> 13:42.483
Your gifts to the world
will live on long after you die,

13:42.588 --> 13:43.953
whenever you actually die.

13:44.123 --> 13:46.887
You think you can
call this existence living?

13:46.992 --> 13:50.758
- The Cabal hunt me at every turn.
- But why?

13:50.863 --> 13:52.888
You've been underground
for decades.

13:52.998 --> 13:56.900
We both know the Cabal only go after
what they perceive to be of value.

13:57.002 --> 13:59.732
Or a threat.

14:12.418 --> 14:16.252
Pull our people back.
Get these guys out of here.

14:16.355 --> 14:18.619
I want the LRAD down here
and set up in three minutes.

14:18.724 --> 14:19.713
Yes, sir.

14:26.165 --> 14:27.894
Another one?

14:28.000 --> 14:30.332
That's the second attack
in two hours.

14:30.436 --> 14:32.404
I never saw what it was.

14:32.504 --> 14:34.938
It came from the ceiling.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.634
Oh, moved way too fast.

14:37.743 --> 14:39.904
What about... him?
Did he see anything?

14:40.012 --> 14:42.207
No. I was-

14:42.314 --> 14:43.611
I was...

14:43.716 --> 14:46.651
He was meditating
when it happened.

14:48.354 --> 14:49.912
If it's in the elevator system...

14:50.022 --> 14:54.152
Yeah, it can get
to anywhere in the Sanctuary.

14:54.260 --> 14:55.659
All right, let's get him
to the infirmary,

14:55.761 --> 14:57.524
and then we'll meet up
at Henry's lab.

14:57.630 --> 14:59.825
Okay, ready? One, two, three!

15:02.534 --> 15:04.695
Footage of the first
two attacks came up empty -

15:04.803 --> 15:06.668
likely because whatever it is
shorted out the power

15:06.772 --> 15:10.037
to the surveillance systems
before it struck.

15:10.142 --> 15:11.370
Yeah, but we
should have caught something

15:11.477 --> 15:12.705
in the camera in the elevator.

15:12.811 --> 15:13.971
I'm having a look.

15:16.649 --> 15:17.707
You okay?

15:17.816 --> 15:20.785
Yeah, it's just a flu
going around. I'm fine.

15:34.333 --> 15:35.357
Whoa!

15:36.869 --> 15:38.336
Wow.

15:38.437 --> 15:40.735
Whatever it is,
it's damn fast.

15:41.707 --> 15:45.199
Uh, can you slow it down
and enhance the image?

15:49.882 --> 15:52.146
- Hmm?
- Yes! But take the safety off first.

15:52.251 --> 15:55.618
What?
Oh, I'm fine. I'm...

15:56.255 --> 15:57.654
You have fever.

15:58.257 --> 15:59.224
You should rest.

15:59.325 --> 16:00.257
No, I can hack it.

16:00.359 --> 16:01.724
No, no, maybe
the big guy's right -

16:01.827 --> 16:03.818
you should
get some rest.

16:03.929 --> 16:05.521
But, listen,
before you go, um,

16:05.631 --> 16:07.599
can you bring up
the footage of the corridors

16:07.700 --> 16:09.065
above and below
where the attack took place?

16:09.168 --> 16:13.127
Let him rest.
He will work later.

16:13.238 --> 16:14.296
Okay.

16:14.406 --> 16:16.033
Well, just show me
how to access the footage, and-

16:16.141 --> 16:19.542
He's going to rest, now!

16:19.645 --> 16:21.738
Oh. Okay.

16:21.847 --> 16:23.041
Get better.

16:24.950 --> 16:27.612
Why would
the Cabal see you as a threat?

16:27.720 --> 16:30.188
I'm a vampire. Some people
are threatened by that.

16:30.289 --> 16:31.916
Only part, Nikola.

16:32.024 --> 16:34.151
Pure-blood vampires
were wiped out centuries ago.

16:34.259 --> 16:38.355
Besides, you alone are not enough
to make the Cabal this angry.

16:38.464 --> 16:40.159
What's really going on?

16:40.265 --> 16:46.067
The ancient ones - they were
intelligent, gifted, powerful,

16:46.171 --> 16:51.803
until a bunch of church-folk decided
that our race was impure, evil,

16:51.910 --> 16:54.208
and not only did they
hunt them down, kill them off,

16:54.313 --> 16:57.282
but they turned our species
into a cultural joke.

16:57.383 --> 17:01.376
Ancient vampires were the Caesars,
the Pharaohs of civilization.

17:01.487 --> 17:03.512
Humans were enslaved.
They rose up with good reason.

17:03.622 --> 17:04.611
If the world
knew the truth-

17:04.723 --> 17:08.659
Humans were conquered because
we were smarter and stronger.

17:08.761 --> 17:11.286
And when vampires ruled the world,
it was a golden age.

17:11.497 --> 17:14.227
Science, art,
architecture all advanced.

17:14.333 --> 17:16.267
And after they killed them off,
what happened?

17:17.301 --> 17:18.598
The Dark Ages.

17:18.804 --> 17:20.738
And now people think
that we're allergic to garlic

17:20.839 --> 17:23.773
and that we
can turn into bats at will.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.309
It's beyond insulting.

17:26.545 --> 17:28.672
This way.

17:29.715 --> 17:31.683
Sir, all teams
have been pulled back.

17:31.784 --> 17:32.773
Good.

17:37.756 --> 17:39.087
Let's clean 'em out.

17:42.961 --> 17:45.953
As though a vial of stale
water blessed by some priest

17:46.065 --> 17:48.693
would have any other effect
than a bad taste in my-

17:49.401 --> 17:51.733
- Earthquake?
- Worse!

18:04.016 --> 18:05.074
Nikola?

18:21.900 --> 18:24.391
I want to suck your blood.

18:25.737 --> 18:26.726
Get down from there.

18:33.345 --> 18:34.607
Irony is...

18:34.713 --> 18:36.772
I once owned
the patent to that weapon.

18:36.882 --> 18:40.682
I never should've sold it to Edison,
cheapskate that he was.

18:40.786 --> 18:42.879
Do you think this is funny?

18:42.988 --> 18:44.853
Tricking me into helping you
with whatever game

18:44.957 --> 18:47.050
you're playing with the Cabal?

18:47.159 --> 18:49.320
I don't appreciate
being put in the line of fire.

18:49.428 --> 18:50.417
Helen-

18:50.529 --> 18:52.087
You've always been like this,
haven't you?

18:52.297 --> 18:53.127
Selfish and arrogant,

18:53.232 --> 18:55.257
putting your own desires
before everyone else's.

18:55.367 --> 18:57.665
I brought you here
for two reasons -

18:57.769 --> 19:00.067
because only you can help me
finish what I'm working on

19:00.172 --> 19:01.161
and because I love you.

19:01.273 --> 19:03.503
Yes, so you keep...

19:03.609 --> 19:04.598
What?

19:05.611 --> 19:06.942
I always have.

19:09.481 --> 19:14.783
More than that lunatic Druitt
ever did.

19:14.987 --> 19:17.251
I misled you,
and I deeply apologize for that,

19:17.356 --> 19:18.948
but I had to see you.

19:20.526 --> 19:21.891
You're serious, aren't you?

19:30.002 --> 19:33.699
We knew each other in London,
your mother and I,

19:33.805 --> 19:36.000
when we were young.

19:36.108 --> 19:37.575
In fact, we were rather close.

19:38.677 --> 19:40.110
See, now I know
you're full of crap.

19:40.212 --> 19:41.941
Because she's 158 years old?

19:42.047 --> 19:45.380
First off, she's 157.

19:45.484 --> 19:46.781
And I get that she's special.

19:46.885 --> 19:50.753
It's... some sort of accident
of her genetic make-up.

19:50.856 --> 19:52.824
But the chances of two people
having the same defect-

19:52.925 --> 19:57.089
Are much higher
if it's no accident.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.891
- You're sure?
- Hyah!

20:05.971 --> 20:07.598
This is tedious.

20:10.075 --> 20:12.339
- Ah!
- Should we talk here?

20:12.544 --> 20:14.034
Ah! What are you doing?

20:14.646 --> 20:16.113
Or here?!

20:16.215 --> 20:18.547
Oh, my God! Oh!

20:18.984 --> 20:21.646
Agh! Stop this!

20:22.354 --> 20:26.051
As I said, there's little time!
I need to know where Helen is!

20:32.164 --> 20:35.327
It knew how to disable
the motion detectors.

20:36.768 --> 20:39.259
Made us blind on purpose.

20:41.206 --> 20:42.969
It's that intelligent?

20:43.075 --> 20:46.374
The most dangerous things are.

20:47.546 --> 20:49.070
Hey, check this out.

20:50.816 --> 20:53.046
A scale?

20:53.585 --> 20:55.985
Looks almost reptilian.

20:56.521 --> 20:59.183
- You think it's still here?
- Unlikely.

21:12.838 --> 21:16.797
Diazepam.
It's a garden-variety sedative.

21:16.908 --> 21:19.638
Treats everything
from insomnia to seizures.

21:24.449 --> 21:29.580
Looks like whatever did this
wanted some badly.

21:29.688 --> 21:30.780
What kind of abnormal

21:30.889 --> 21:34.325
has the ferocity
and power of a wild animal...

21:35.327 --> 21:39.161
...combined with the cunning
and intellect of a human?

21:40.299 --> 21:43.564
Other than, you know, you.

21:47.306 --> 21:51.333
Back at Oxford, the others used
the Source for power and for greed,

21:51.443 --> 21:56.642
but you... you altered yourself
out of a pure desire for knowledge.

22:01.887 --> 22:05.152
You're the only scientist,
perhaps the only person,

22:05.257 --> 22:06.781
I've ever really admired.

22:07.993 --> 22:09.756
Come on.

22:11.596 --> 22:17.592
This picture was taken
by Henry Talbot in Southampton.

22:17.703 --> 22:22.299
1880, uh, something,
I forget the exact date.

22:22.407 --> 22:23.897
Where did you get this?

22:24.009 --> 22:28.605
It was a gift from your mother
while we were both at Oxford,

22:29.748 --> 22:33.707
though she was just
auditing courses in those days.

22:33.819 --> 22:36.344
No women were allowed to enrol,

22:36.455 --> 22:39.822
a rule she railed against
with a vengeance, believe me.

22:39.925 --> 22:41.825
You were college buddies
with my mom?

22:41.993 --> 22:43.517
Yes, at first.

22:44.329 --> 22:46.354
Things became
more serious between us later.

22:46.465 --> 22:48.990
Okay, dude, you have to stop
referring to my mom as your "ex,"

22:49.101 --> 22:50.625
or, seriously, I will kill you.

22:56.408 --> 23:01.436
We were part of something,
something we called "The Five" -

23:01.546 --> 23:03.343
a small group dedicated
to expanding our knowledge

23:03.448 --> 23:04.574
of the physical world,

23:04.783 --> 23:07.047
by the most unconventional means.

23:07.152 --> 23:08.915
How can you be old like her?

23:09.087 --> 23:10.384
Well, unlike what you've been told,

23:10.489 --> 23:12.923
your mother was not born
with a genetic abnormality.

23:13.125 --> 23:15.457
No, she chose
to become something different.

23:15.560 --> 23:16.652
We all did.

23:18.196 --> 23:21.324
We were so curious to know
what humans could become,

23:21.433 --> 23:24.334
evolve into,
given the chance.

23:25.437 --> 23:26.836
Who were the others?

23:26.938 --> 23:28.371
Who, besides
your mother and myself?

23:29.241 --> 23:31.607
It was Nigel Griffin,

23:31.710 --> 23:33.109
Sir James Watson,

23:33.211 --> 23:34.405
and Nikola Tesla.

23:35.814 --> 23:39.580
- As in the-
- Yes. The same.

23:39.684 --> 23:45.384
I still say he leeched off Edison
and cheated Marconi.

23:45.490 --> 23:48.459
But, I digress.

23:48.560 --> 23:51.859
Have you heard of the species
sanguine vampiris?

23:52.697 --> 23:54.164
Yeah, a vampire.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.597
They're extinct.

23:56.067 --> 23:57.534
Not quite.

23:57.636 --> 24:00.969
They were all but exterminated
by the church centuries ago.

24:01.072 --> 24:04.530
Those who lived through the purges
were made sterile.

24:04.643 --> 24:07.806
Your mother was able
to procure a very rare sample

24:07.913 --> 24:10.746
of ancient, untainted vampire blood,

24:10.849 --> 24:11.781
one that was collected

24:11.883 --> 24:14.875
before the sterilization of the species
was carried out,

24:14.986 --> 24:19.548
blood that supposedly possessed
miraculous properties.

24:19.658 --> 24:23.822
No one had ever dared inject
pure sanguine vampiris...

24:23.929 --> 24:28.093
...until your mother
derived a serum from it.

24:28.200 --> 24:28.894
it's ready.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.968
You don't have to go first.

24:31.069 --> 24:33.230
John or I could have a go to start.

24:33.338 --> 24:36.398
He's right.
No need for unnecessary heroics.

24:36.508 --> 24:39.636
The side effects
are completely unknown.

24:39.744 --> 24:41.507
Thank you, gentlemen,

24:41.613 --> 24:44.377
but this experiment
was of my design.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.542
I shall be the one to prove its worth.

24:46.651 --> 24:48.118
Helen.

24:48.220 --> 24:50.415
You're certain?

24:50.522 --> 24:54.219
We've risked too much
to turn back now.

24:54.326 --> 24:55.759
We need to know.

25:00.832 --> 25:04.632
You may proceed, Nikola.

25:31.963 --> 25:34.022
Wait a minute.

25:34.132 --> 25:35.531
She's part vampire?

25:35.700 --> 25:37.327
No.

25:37.435 --> 25:39.198
She's human.

25:39.304 --> 25:41.829
And so much more.

25:41.940 --> 25:46.843
After each of us was injected,
we received unique gifts as a result.

25:47.045 --> 25:49.240
Yeah, seen yours in action, thanks.

25:49.347 --> 25:51.781
Griffin's molecules
became photosensitive,

25:51.883 --> 25:54.545
Watson's mind
grew to new heights,

25:54.653 --> 25:57.247
and Tesla's reaction
was the most dramatic.

25:57.455 --> 26:01.357
His genetic disposition
brought forth vampiric traits

26:01.459 --> 26:04.428
which had lain dormant in his genes.

26:05.897 --> 26:08.331
But your mother...

26:08.433 --> 26:09.832
Well...

26:09.935 --> 26:13.735
Her gift was
the most simple and elegant.

26:14.839 --> 26:17.831
It's as though whatever's
doing this can just disappear.

26:18.076 --> 26:19.839
Yeah, but there's nothing
like that living here.

26:20.045 --> 26:21.535
That we know of.

26:21.646 --> 26:24.638
Could be one of our residents
is manifesting a new power.

26:24.749 --> 26:26.444
- I don't know.
Oh.

26:26.885 --> 26:29.046
I thought it was
"starve a fever. "

26:29.154 --> 26:30.587
An old wives' tale.

26:40.932 --> 26:43.196
You need nourishment.

26:43.535 --> 26:45.662
Oh, is that mushroom?

26:45.770 --> 26:47.067
Eat!

26:48.173 --> 26:49.970
So, were you down there recently?

26:50.075 --> 26:51.269
Where?

26:51.376 --> 26:53.173
Storage.

26:53.278 --> 26:54.336
I don't remember.

26:54.446 --> 26:56.744
I get around a lot in a day.

26:56.848 --> 26:58.975
When did that happen?

26:59.084 --> 27:00.278
Oh, that?

27:00.385 --> 27:05.186
Uh, did that yesterday, moving
some equipment in the lab. Why?

27:05.290 --> 27:08.555
Oh, we found some fresh blood
on one of the boxes in the storage.

27:09.594 --> 27:11.425
The creature's?

27:11.529 --> 27:13.394
I don't know. With you out
of commission and Magnus away,

27:13.498 --> 27:15.659
I haven't been able
to run a detailed analysis.

27:15.767 --> 27:19.168
Well, when she gets back,
I'm sure she'll get to the bottom of it.

27:21.139 --> 27:22.128
I'm just thinking,

27:22.240 --> 27:25.732
if the blood is yours,
we can eliminate it as evidence.

27:25.844 --> 27:28.335
Listen, dude, seriously,
I don't remember being down there.

27:28.546 --> 27:31.276
Will, he must rest.

27:32.283 --> 27:34.751
What was the piece of equipment
in your lab that cut you?

27:34.853 --> 27:36.753
I don't know, Will!
Something sharp.

27:36.988 --> 27:38.615
Did Magnus order
a restock of diazepam?

27:38.823 --> 27:42.224
- What?
- Will!

27:42.327 --> 27:43.794
Go.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.632
Sorry.

27:53.104 --> 27:56.039
Bravo and Delta teams,
close in from alternate exit points.

27:56.141 --> 27:57.267
Yes, sir!

28:02.981 --> 28:05.074
I- I feel so safe when I'm with you.

28:05.183 --> 28:06.207
Quiet!

28:09.421 --> 28:11.286
We're going to have to fight
our way out of here.

28:11.389 --> 28:12.378
No killing.

28:13.191 --> 28:15.489
Said the woman with the gun
to the vampire.

28:16.628 --> 28:20.394
- Just follow my lead.
- It won't be necessary.

28:20.498 --> 28:22.693
I, for one, don't intend
to get captured or killed.

28:22.901 --> 28:24.801
- You won't.
- What do you mean?

28:34.079 --> 28:37.515
The playing field just got leveled.

28:41.753 --> 28:43.846
Bravo teams, check in!

28:45.123 --> 28:46.920
All teams, report!

29:21.459 --> 29:24.087
Oh, my God.
What did this?

29:24.796 --> 29:31.224
It's not so much the "what"
as the "why" that counts.

29:31.336 --> 29:34.134
This is your project, isn't it?

29:34.239 --> 29:35.729
This is what
you've been working on.

29:36.107 --> 29:38.837
Tonight, you get
to witness the rebirth

29:38.943 --> 29:42.276
of the greatest abnormal
that ever walked the Earth.

29:49.053 --> 29:51.419
My God, Nikola,
what have you done?

29:53.091 --> 29:55.491
Welcome to the future.

29:57.796 --> 30:04.031
I realize you need time
to process all this,

30:04.135 --> 30:09.072
but it isn't a luxury that we have.

30:09.174 --> 30:12.041
I like your story.
It's a nice story.

30:12.210 --> 30:15.668
Tesla is intent on making contact
with your mother.

30:15.780 --> 30:18.248
Imminently.

30:18.349 --> 30:20.112
Now, whatever you
may think of me, of The Five,

30:20.218 --> 30:22.049
he's easily the most dangerous.

30:22.353 --> 30:24.753
Good twist.
Not enough.

30:24.856 --> 30:26.721
Ashley...

30:27.926 --> 30:31.054
I am not your enemy,

30:31.162 --> 30:32.322
not anymore.

30:33.131 --> 30:35.656
Baldy, you invaded our house.

30:35.767 --> 30:37.359
You fed me to a giant iguana.

30:37.468 --> 30:38.992
If that's not enough
to make you my enemy,

30:39.103 --> 30:40.400
then what the hell is?

30:40.572 --> 30:42.199
I was wrong
to try to reason with you.

30:42.307 --> 30:43.797
You're incapable
of seeing the truth.

30:44.008 --> 30:45.168
What truth?

30:45.343 --> 30:50.645
That you have no concept
of the meaning of your work.

30:50.748 --> 30:55.208
You just shoot, maim, and capture
whatever Mummy tells you,

30:55.320 --> 30:59.188
without a single regard
for the consequences of your actions.

30:59.290 --> 31:00.621
That is not true.

31:00.725 --> 31:04.991
Oh, you're a killer, all right.
You live for the thrill of the hunt,

31:05.096 --> 31:08.862
the exquisite rush
of that moment of violence.

31:08.967 --> 31:15.270
You find it utterly intoxicating.
I know the feeling very well myself.

31:15.473 --> 31:17.737
I am nothing like you!

31:17.842 --> 31:21.369
Oh, you'd like nothing more
than to kill me,

31:21.479 --> 31:25.245
resurrect your wounded pride,

31:25.350 --> 31:27.511
get some blood on your hands.

31:27.719 --> 31:31.314
The only reason
you haven't really tried

31:31.422 --> 31:34.949
is because you aren't sure
if you can pull it off.

31:35.059 --> 31:38.085
We don't have time.
We have to go.

31:41.065 --> 31:43.932
I'm appealing to your judgment,

31:44.035 --> 31:45.662
to your intuition.

31:45.770 --> 31:49.001
I want you to think, not just act.

31:49.107 --> 31:52.076
See, I brought you here
to help you, Ashley,

31:52.176 --> 31:58.206
give you the chance
to make a choice...

31:58.316 --> 32:00.910
...to show you a world your mother
has kept hidden from you.

32:01.119 --> 32:04.020
Don't turn away from it.
Trust me.

32:04.122 --> 32:05.953
Help me save your mother.

32:07.225 --> 32:09.921
What the hell are they?

32:10.028 --> 32:12.997
Well, in a very basic sense,

32:13.097 --> 32:14.086
they're me.

32:14.265 --> 32:16.165
You found a way
to revive the species?

32:17.068 --> 32:18.865
The question -

32:18.970 --> 32:23.270
could I use my own altered DNA...

32:24.842 --> 32:30.280
...to turn a boring old homo sapien

32:30.381 --> 32:34.408
into a higher,
more evolved species?

32:36.988 --> 32:42.517
And the answer is so simple,

32:43.795 --> 32:46.730
it will make you cry.

32:48.666 --> 32:50.258
Watch.

33:16.060 --> 33:18.119
What does Tesla want with my mom?

33:19.430 --> 33:22.661
Tesla's intent on creating
an army of deadly creatures,

33:22.767 --> 33:25.167
topple the Cabal once and for all.

33:25.970 --> 33:30.270
Helen will undoubtedly refuse
his offer to join him in his efforts,

33:30.375 --> 33:36.007
and when she does, he will kill her.

33:36.180 --> 33:37.807
How do you know all this?

33:38.016 --> 33:39.483
Because...

33:41.185 --> 33:43.449
...he came to me first.

33:44.455 --> 33:48.152
My last encounter with your mother
did indeed leave me close to death,

33:48.359 --> 33:53.387
but Tesla found me, revived me,

33:53.498 --> 33:56.023
and when I refused him...

33:57.602 --> 33:59.968
Well...

34:00.071 --> 34:02.972
Nothing quite like electroshock
therapy to clear the mind.

34:03.074 --> 34:04.336
Oh, my God.

34:04.509 --> 34:10.607
And the rage
that once fueled me is gone.

34:10.715 --> 34:13.980
I'm whole once again.

34:17.121 --> 34:22.922
Together, we can save her,

34:23.027 --> 34:25.996
but I need to know where she is.

34:26.397 --> 34:28.956
I am your only hope.

34:29.867 --> 34:32.165
Please...

34:32.270 --> 34:35.637
I need to make things right.

34:37.507 --> 34:38.600
For you.

34:40.678 --> 34:42.475
For her.

34:45.216 --> 34:47.150
Well, thanks for joining the party.

34:49.853 --> 34:52.846
Now, uh... go join the others.

34:56.127 --> 34:57.116
See, the cool thing

34:57.228 --> 35:00.755
about me using my own DNA
to reanimate the dead is

35:00.865 --> 35:04.528
they do whatever I say.

35:04.635 --> 35:07.035
- But they're practically mindless.
- I know.

35:07.205 --> 35:12.074
They're fast, vicious, strong,
but they're as dumb as tree stumps,

35:12.176 --> 35:14.110
which defeats
the whole purpose of the project.

35:15.246 --> 35:17.043
You want me to help you
make them intelligent?

35:17.448 --> 35:21.384
This is the culmination of everything
we stood for as The Five,

35:21.486 --> 35:22.851
pushing boundaries,

35:22.954 --> 35:25.821
exploring realms of science
that other people were afraid to.

35:25.923 --> 35:27.322
Just imagine...

35:31.028 --> 35:32.928
...sanguine vampiris...

35:36.000 --> 35:36.989
...reborn.

35:38.769 --> 35:40.168
They would only enslave us again.

35:40.371 --> 35:41.963
Oh, I don't think human beings

35:42.073 --> 35:46.009
are doing such a good job of it
right now, do you? Hmm?

35:46.210 --> 35:48.405
You and I could usher in

35:48.513 --> 35:53.974
a new golden age
of thought and culture and peace.

35:55.586 --> 35:58.680
- You're mad, Nikola.
- No!

35:58.789 --> 36:01.656
The Philadelphia Experiment
was mad,

36:01.759 --> 36:05.422
but this... is progress.

36:07.165 --> 36:09.827
Dude, I am not a shape-shifter.

36:09.934 --> 36:12.232
What about the treatments
you've been undergoing with Magnus

36:12.336 --> 36:14.497
which are so secret, I'm not
even allowed to know about them?

36:14.605 --> 36:16.835
- That's personal.
- And I respect that.

36:16.941 --> 36:19.739
But I need to know what's
been attacking people around here.

36:19.844 --> 36:21.209
I just want to rule this out.

36:21.312 --> 36:23.177
Then you're just gonna
have to take my word for it.

36:23.347 --> 36:25.542
Covering this up, Henry,
is only going to make it worse.

36:25.650 --> 36:27.675
I can help you,
but if someone else is attacked-

36:27.785 --> 36:30.913
Get out, Will!
I mean it.

36:31.022 --> 36:32.353
Go.

36:37.695 --> 36:41.927
We all know
the abnormals are on the rise,

36:42.033 --> 36:45.059
and now we just need
somebody to lead them.

36:46.804 --> 36:47.793
You?

36:49.740 --> 36:50.729
Us.

36:55.313 --> 36:57.543
You saw...

36:57.648 --> 37:01.049
...how my mini-me's handled
those trackers earlier tonight.

37:01.152 --> 37:04.144
Now, just imagine an army of them,

37:04.255 --> 37:05.916
but massively intelligent!

37:06.023 --> 37:07.047
You and I could give the Cabal-

37:14.532 --> 37:15.624
Ouch.

37:18.102 --> 37:21.162
Get her.

37:31.482 --> 37:33.040
Easy... Easy...

38:18.896 --> 38:20.454
Henry...

38:22.400 --> 38:23.526
Why didn't he just tell me?

38:25.936 --> 38:28.871
He didn't want anyone to know,

38:28.973 --> 38:30.634
and I promised him
no one would.

38:33.778 --> 38:37.043
Henry... just lie still.

38:41.085 --> 38:43.417
Can we be certain
they came down here?

38:45.690 --> 38:47.123
Definitely one of Mom's.

38:47.224 --> 38:48.418
She always carries a gun?

38:50.394 --> 38:52.191
With good reason.

38:54.865 --> 38:57.095
TESLA
Not yet!

38:57.201 --> 38:58.190
Not yet.

39:01.806 --> 39:03.364
Back off.

39:10.681 --> 39:12.205
Helen...

39:14.285 --> 39:15.718
...nice shooting.

39:17.688 --> 39:19.053
I thought you loved me.

39:20.891 --> 39:23.485
Did I?

39:23.594 --> 39:25.061
Huh...

39:26.464 --> 39:30.195
I don't think
it's going to work out.

39:30.701 --> 39:32.760
Well, then...

39:32.870 --> 39:36.931
I guess I can tell you
that at Oxford, no one liked you.

39:37.041 --> 39:40.568
Aw... was it
because I was a genius?

39:40.678 --> 39:42.077
No.

39:42.179 --> 39:44.204
Because you were
an obnoxious ass.

39:46.617 --> 39:48.107
Well...

39:49.253 --> 39:50.880
Guess who's still standing?

39:53.958 --> 39:57.291
John...
- Hello, Nikola.

40:03.000 --> 40:06.094
- John, what the hell are you doing?
- Saving your life.

40:06.737 --> 40:08.796
Why?

40:08.906 --> 40:09.895
You've had a long night, Helen.

40:10.007 --> 40:13.340
I'm simply glad to see you
safe and sound.

40:13.444 --> 40:15.435
The blood I gave you,

40:15.546 --> 40:17.673
it should have crippled you,
or worse.

40:17.782 --> 40:19.010
It did.

40:19.116 --> 40:20.606
Then how...

40:26.190 --> 40:28.317
Ashley can explain.

40:37.201 --> 40:39.431
Hey,
how are you feeling?

40:39.537 --> 40:40.697
Fine.

40:40.905 --> 40:43.465
Just wanted to let you know we...

40:43.574 --> 40:47.806
We chased that snake creature
to the basement warehouse.

40:47.912 --> 40:50.710
Looks like it hatched
inside one of the artifacts

40:50.915 --> 40:53.941
that Magnus brought back
from the Amazon a few months ago.

40:54.151 --> 40:56.779
It must've escaped
and grown to full maturity

40:56.887 --> 40:58.980
inside the walls here, and...

41:04.462 --> 41:05.952
Listen, I was a jerk.

41:07.731 --> 41:13.897
I just didn't think what it must be like
to carry this around with you.

41:14.004 --> 41:15.631
I'm sorry.

41:26.851 --> 41:30.150
And, hey, uh...

41:30.254 --> 41:32.415
Thanks for saving my ass.

41:41.532 --> 41:43.500
You're welcome.

42:16.033 --> 42:18.024
He's my father, isn't he?

42:20.371 --> 42:23.238
Yes... he is.

42:36.587 --> 42:38.555
I've never shown you Rome, have I?

42:41.125 --> 42:43.218
There was never time.

42:45.963 --> 42:48.955
I have a lot to make up for.

42:51.569 --> 42:53.264
Shall we?

43:04.682 --> 43:06.240
Yeah.
