to even face my neighbors.

how much work women must do.

your leftover rice on mine to clean it up,

and not be seen.

of not being able to protect my mother.

30:46.740 --> 30:49.280
You fool. How can you be so stupid?

30:49.340 --> 30:50.440
Jo-yi, that hurts!

30:50.510 --> 30:53.210
How can you get yourself pregnant when
you have your whole life ahead of you?

30:53.280 --> 30:55.110
What are you going to do about this?

30:55.180 --> 30:57.450
-Let me explain.
-Tell me who this bum is!

30:57.550 --> 30:59.490
He is not a bum.

30:59.550 --> 31:01.650
Then what?
Is he the Magistrate or something?

31:01.720 --> 31:03.760
Yes, the Magistrate is the baby's father.

31:03.820 --> 31:05.590
-The Magistrate?
-Yes, the Magistrate.

31:06.190 --> 31:09.100
I am done with men
grabbing my butt all the time,

31:09.160 --> 31:12.900
so I did this in order to
have a good life wearing pretty frocks.

31:12.970 --> 31:15.000
Will you be...

31:15.500 --> 31:17.240
his concubine then?

31:22.480 --> 31:25.210
Good job. You did well.

31:25.280 --> 31:27.010
Love does not put food on the table.

31:27.080 --> 31:29.680
No one has more power
in Gyehwa Valley than him,

31:29.750 --> 31:31.990
and it is a fine way
to turn our lives around.

31:32.050 --> 31:33.290
You did well.

31:34.520 --> 31:37.260
-Really?
-I was worried that some loafer

31:37.320 --> 31:38.890
had gotten you pregnant,

31:39.330 --> 31:40.690
but it worked out for the better.

31:41.090 --> 31:43.760
At least the governor's son
will not have to live like this.

31:44.430 --> 31:46.500
Think of all the times you had to work

31:46.600 --> 31:49.140
in the heart of winter and summer.

31:49.540 --> 31:52.570
Goodness. Look at how dry your hands are.

31:53.140 --> 31:54.840
Even a log would have more moisture.

31:57.280 --> 31:58.980
Besides, the Magistrate

31:59.550 --> 32:02.320
will not be able to ignore me
if you stand as a witness.

32:03.780 --> 32:04.820
A witness?

32:06.820 --> 32:08.450
Actually,

32:09.160 --> 32:11.490
I came to see you for a reason today.

32:26.940 --> 32:28.010
What?

32:29.140 --> 32:30.180
Stop right there.

32:30.610 --> 32:33.080
Not my precious fabric!

32:34.550 --> 32:36.820
Who said you could stop working?

32:37.480 --> 32:39.150
Keep on banging.

32:39.250 --> 32:42.160
I am sure he went
to go gambling that night.

32:43.990 --> 32:45.330
Do you not remember it?

32:45.630 --> 32:47.060
It was the night where...

32:47.130 --> 32:50.500
miners from Gyeongsang Province

32:50.630 --> 32:53.730
came by flashing their silver coins
at the card game.

32:54.770 --> 32:57.600
Oh, that? Yes, I think I saw them.

32:57.800 --> 32:59.470
When I served them drinks.

33:00.510 --> 33:02.540
Bo-ri, if that is what you saw,

33:04.140 --> 33:06.010
could you testify?

33:06.680 --> 33:07.980
-Testify?
-Yes.

33:08.920 --> 33:10.280
You will be closing up this tavern

33:10.350 --> 33:12.090
once you become
the Magistrate's concubine anyway.

33:13.090 --> 33:15.290
If I can prove
that he partook in gambling,

33:15.860 --> 33:17.420
I can get my nabi from him.

33:18.260 --> 33:23.130
[Nabi: a token given to commoners
that signifies their divorce]

33:36.480 --> 33:38.540
Bo-ri, please.

33:39.850 --> 33:42.150
Can you help me spread my wings and fly?

33:42.950 --> 33:43.980
Hold on.

33:44.950 --> 33:48.760
Are you asking me to state
that your husband was here gambling?

33:48.820 --> 33:49.960
Yes.

33:51.590 --> 33:54.060
The men in this neighborhood
are thick as thieves

33:54.130 --> 33:55.630
and will not come forward.

33:56.530 --> 33:59.200
Bo-ri, please.

33:59.730 --> 34:02.140
But they are my customers.

34:04.270 --> 34:06.940
I need your help to turn my life around.

34:08.239 --> 34:12.150
If I could, I would take the state exam
and work as an official,

34:12.310 --> 34:13.980
but that is not allowed.

34:15.820 --> 34:17.820
But to live like this
always complaining about my life

34:17.880 --> 34:19.590
is even worse
than not having opportunities.

34:25.360 --> 34:27.130
I wish to be happy too.

34:29.830 --> 34:31.230
Will you not help me?

34:32.030 --> 34:34.400
Bo-ri, what do you say?

34:39.310 --> 34:40.540
Please.

34:45.710 --> 34:49.179
Fine. Of course, I could do
this much for you.

34:49.550 --> 34:51.449
Do not fret
for I will testify on your behalf.

34:51.820 --> 34:53.850
Thank you, Bo-ri!

34:54.790 --> 34:55.989
Gosh, the baby.

34:58.260 --> 35:01.260
Please do not tell me
that I smacked your belly earlier.

35:06.730 --> 35:09.900
Hwang Bo-ri,
you have got to pull it together.

35:10.500 --> 35:12.740
Because you are now a mother.

35:13.110 --> 35:15.040
A mother. Do you hear me?

35:27.520 --> 35:28.650
[Post Station]

35:41.470 --> 35:44.270
[Post Station]

35:45.440 --> 35:47.610
Pull this way to change direction.

35:47.910 --> 35:49.040
Darn it.

35:51.280 --> 35:52.650
Darn this...

35:52.980 --> 35:53.850
How is my landing?

35:53.910 --> 35:55.010
How do you feed it?

35:57.450 --> 35:59.490
-I think I have gotten the hang of it.
-Good job.

36:00.820 --> 36:02.020
Nicely done.

36:04.590 --> 36:06.160
Where are you off to?

36:07.030 --> 36:08.160
Wait for me!

36:08.800 --> 36:09.830
You...

36:17.500 --> 36:18.810
-My lord.
-Giddy-up.

36:18.870 --> 36:20.740
Are we not going to eat?

36:20.810 --> 36:22.110
-My lord.
-The delicacy of Chungcheong Province

36:22.180 --> 36:23.040
awaits us.

36:23.180 --> 36:25.140
The horse is actually
being treated better.

36:25.240 --> 36:26.310
Go ahead.

36:31.950 --> 36:34.990
My lord, we are starving.

36:35.250 --> 36:37.590
Oh, of course.

36:38.660 --> 36:39.730
Here you go.

36:41.230 --> 36:42.300
Enjoy.

36:45.460 --> 36:48.670
♫ Jjaggeuli, let it boil ♫

36:48.730 --> 36:51.070
♫ Jjaggeuli, here I come ♫

36:56.380 --> 36:58.010
♫ Jjaggeuli ♫

36:58.080 --> 37:03.550
♫ Jjaggeuli, let it boil ♫

37:04.550 --> 37:09.520
♫ Jjaggeuli, here I come ♫

37:23.940 --> 37:26.670
My gosh. This feels so nice.

37:27.710 --> 37:28.810
Oh, my.

37:31.540 --> 37:32.510
What...

37:37.380 --> 37:38.650
What is that? That is disgusting!

37:38.720 --> 37:40.820
Goo-pal. Earlier,

37:40.890 --> 37:42.860
I saw a mill at the village entrance
on our way here.

37:42.920 --> 37:45.060
We will rob that place later.

37:45.120 --> 37:48.390
I will punch the owner in the temple
and knock him out.

37:48.460 --> 37:49.930
You tie him up.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.830
Okay. Let us please do that.

37:51.900 --> 37:54.800
We could have been good
had we met a good master, right?

37:54.870 --> 37:56.700
We have been walking for days,

37:56.770 --> 37:57.940
but we have eaten nothing

37:58.000 --> 37:59.540
except for two rice balls
and three tiny jujube fruits.

37:59.610 --> 38:02.410
No one deserves to be treated like this!

38:02.480 --> 38:04.680
My stomach lining has shriveled
and is now stuck to my spine,

38:04.740 --> 38:06.410
so I cannot even walk any further.

38:06.480 --> 38:08.850
Please tell my lord
that I shall now breathe my last

38:08.950 --> 38:10.880
and bite the dust.

38:11.250 --> 38:13.190
Goo-pal!

38:13.550 --> 38:14.690
Stay with me.

38:15.050 --> 38:17.190
You cannot leave me! Snap out of it.

38:17.790 --> 38:20.430
Goo-pal!

38:20.490 --> 38:21.530
Hey.

38:22.060 --> 38:24.100
We ate light for just two days.

38:24.160 --> 38:26.570
You are talking as though
I starved you for days.

38:26.900 --> 38:28.730
As they say, hunger is the best sauce.

38:28.800 --> 38:30.200
To enjoy such a delicacy,

38:30.270 --> 38:32.340
you should put in this much effort.
Stop whining.

38:32.940 --> 38:34.970
Get up. We are almost there.

38:35.170 --> 38:37.810
-I will get you food.
-When?

38:37.880 --> 38:38.880
In our next life?

38:38.950 --> 38:41.450
I told you. In just 50 ri from here,

38:41.510 --> 38:43.350
there is Chungcheong Province's
most famous diner,

38:43.420 --> 38:45.050
Bo-ri's Jjaggeuli.

38:45.120 --> 38:47.020
I heard they use a special seasoning

38:47.090 --> 38:49.360
made with dried chili powder
to make their famous broth.

38:49.420 --> 38:50.590
Do you not want to taste it?

38:51.090 --> 38:54.260
Jjaggeuli or whatever it is called,
I do not care. I am too hungry to walk.

38:54.460 --> 38:56.460
Remember how horrible things were
during the invasion?

38:56.660 --> 38:58.730
Even back then, I ate better than this.

38:59.200 --> 39:01.830
I will buy you a double portion.

39:01.900 --> 39:03.740
For Goo-pal, that is just one mouthful.

39:03.800 --> 39:05.040
We are not going.

39:07.070 --> 39:08.110
Okay, fine.

39:09.010 --> 39:11.140
A double portion and some boiled pork too.

39:11.210 --> 39:13.050
Boiled pork?
Okay, but order us some rice wine too.

39:17.480 --> 39:19.420
Fine. Deal.

39:20.790 --> 39:21.850
Off we go.

39:25.860 --> 39:26.860
Come on.

39:27.030 --> 39:29.200

39:52.520 --> 39:53.490
[Records of Chungcheong Provincial Office]

39:53.950 --> 39:55.190
What is this?

39:55.450 --> 39:57.760
-Our lifeline.
-What?

39:58.020 --> 39:59.890
You must keep this in a safe place

40:00.230 --> 40:01.990
and pack it
when leaving at a moment's notice.

40:02.460 --> 40:03.460
We are leaving?

40:04.560 --> 40:05.530
Why should we leave?

40:07.130 --> 40:09.400
Just get ready to leave.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.540
That is all you need to know.

40:18.680 --> 40:20.410
Bo-ri, are you still up?

40:21.250 --> 40:22.920
Hey, Jo-yi.

40:26.320 --> 40:28.690
What brings you by this late?
Is everything okay?

40:29.190 --> 40:30.220
Of course.

40:34.260 --> 40:35.290
What is this?

40:35.960 --> 40:37.460
You always wanted to try this.

40:37.760 --> 40:38.800
Have some.

40:40.670 --> 40:42.400
My gosh. I did want to try this but...

40:43.200 --> 40:44.870
Where did you get such a rare delicacy?

40:44.940 --> 40:47.410
I met a peddler from Cheongdo.

40:47.770 --> 40:48.970
He said he smuggled it out.

40:50.780 --> 40:53.350
Wait. Does it mean this was supposed to be

40:53.880 --> 40:55.150
for the King?

40:56.150 --> 40:57.780
It is fine.

40:57.850 --> 41:00.550
I see the nobles steal
and embezzle all the time.

41:01.720 --> 41:04.220
Well, they are nobles.

41:04.290 --> 41:06.230
You need not worry. It is fine.

41:06.390 --> 41:07.990
Your baby wants it.

41:08.060 --> 41:09.660
An auntie can do this much.

41:10.100 --> 41:11.260
Come on. Try it.

41:22.070 --> 41:24.840
This is good. It is very delicious.

41:27.150 --> 41:29.420
Slow down, or you will get indigestion.

41:39.190 --> 41:41.930
So what is the persimmon like?

41:41.990 --> 41:44.030
No, I mean...

41:44.500 --> 41:47.030
What is the Magistrate like?

41:47.230 --> 41:48.430
Is he nice?

41:49.940 --> 41:52.770
Yes. Maybe it is because I grew up alone.

41:52.910 --> 41:54.740
I tend to be attracted to father figures.

41:55.170 --> 41:58.180
Come on.
I still think you are too good for him.

42:00.550 --> 42:02.920
Do you think your baby is healthy?

42:03.050 --> 42:04.020
Yes.

42:04.820 --> 42:06.590
I do not feel it yet,

42:07.090 --> 42:09.720
but I can still feel it.

42:10.590 --> 42:12.690
What? What does that mean?

42:15.730 --> 42:18.800
Anyway, all right.
As long as the two of you are happy.

42:19.830 --> 42:21.570
I sneaked out, so I must hurry back home.

42:21.630 --> 42:22.800
Already?

42:23.270 --> 42:24.900
Take some of this, so you can try it too.

42:24.970 --> 42:26.610
No, it is all yours. Good night!

42:26.710 --> 42:28.610
But you have never tried this either.

42:29.010 --> 42:30.980
-Jo-yi!
-I will see you tomorrow!

42:35.610 --> 42:39.950

-Let us see them!

-Good point.
-Bring the witness.

-What is going on?
-I knew it.

-What?
-My gosh.

43:52.460 --> 43:54.060
-There is no one.
-What did I say?

43:54.130 --> 43:55.960
-I knew it.
-No wonder.

44:22.920 --> 44:24.890
Do we finally get to try
the famous jjaggeuli?

But what if rumors spread that a stranger

44:30.860 --> 44:32.460
is poking around the valley?

44:32.530 --> 44:34.400
You said it would be dangerous
if people found out.

44:35.030 --> 44:36.070
It is.

45:17.580 --> 45:20.580
Learn from me. Be calm, like me.

45:21.280 --> 45:23.580

for the sake of my safety,

-but when we are alone--
-How dare you!

45:26.150 --> 45:28.050
How could you be so rude to our master?

45:29.620 --> 45:30.590
You little...

45:31.320 --> 45:34.390
Stop whining. We shall go and eat.

45:34.660 --> 45:36.630

45:37.130 --> 45:38.730
Hurry and take me there.

45:39.060 --> 45:40.300
Bo-ri's Jjaggeuli--

45:40.370 --> 45:42.870
It is over there,
at the edge of the market to the right.

-Come on.
-Okay.

45:48.670 --> 45:51.640

45:48.970 --> 45:50.080
Here it is.

-Look!
-Finally, we are here!

-"Closed."
-Is anyone there?

46:05.760 --> 46:06.860
-Is it closed?
-"Closed."

46:06.960 --> 46:08.260
Closed? Why is it closed?

Is anyone there?

[Bo-ri's]

46:09.700 --> 46:10.800
Hey.

46:11.330 --> 46:12.500
Is anyone there?

46:12.560 --> 46:13.800
-What do you mean closed?
-Young Master!

46:13.870 --> 46:14.870
Is anyone in there?

46:14.930 --> 46:16.100
We are hungry!

46:16.170 --> 46:17.300
Anyone?

46:17.570 --> 46:19.340
Is no one in there?

46:19.870 --> 46:21.540
-Young Master.
-This is ridiculous.

[Bo-ri's]

46:38.060 --> 46:39.990
How dare you stab me in the back.

46:40.060 --> 46:41.090

46:41.530 --> 46:42.900

Hey, Hwang Bo-ri!

46:51.440 --> 46:52.640
Hwang Bo-ri, where--

46:54.910 --> 46:56.310
Seriously?

47:03.720 --> 47:05.150
Look at her.

47:05.220 --> 47:07.450
She is the one who told me not to worry.

47:07.920 --> 47:09.790
Is the one you are looking for
the owner of this place?

47:09.860 --> 47:12.120
She ran away, knowing she is dead meat
if I catch her.

47:12.190 --> 47:14.360
Ran away? Are you saying
the owner of this place ran away?

47:14.430 --> 47:16.530
She must have gotten cold feet
at the last minute.

47:16.630 --> 47:19.200
So she was in a hurry to leave
as soon as she put the spoon down.

47:18.030 --> 47:21.530
[Bo-ri's]

47:19.260 --> 47:21.530
She is immature yet quick-witted.

47:22.030 --> 47:24.600
If she cannot give testimony,
then what about some evidence?

47:24.940 --> 47:27.010
-See here.
-That wicked girl!

-Running away alone to live her life.
-Where did the owner go?

47:34.450 --> 47:36.420
Can you not see I am talking to you?

What is with these beggars?

47:53.170 --> 47:54.870
[Tavern]

47:54.830 --> 47:57.640
Why are you begging for food
when the owner is not even in the house?

48:00.340 --> 48:03.410
-We are not here to beg for food.
-Get lost.

48:04.480 --> 48:05.640

You are so dead, Hwang Bo-ri.

Are you going after the owner?

-Have you seen Hwang Bo-ri?

48:27.670 --> 48:28.800
Have you seen Bo-ri?

Will you be able to find
the girl named Bo-ri?

48:33.370 --> 48:35.110
What about the food?

48:40.850 --> 48:42.350
Is that not a person?

-My gosh.
-My goodness.

What happened to her?

49:17.380 --> 49:18.520
That is Bo-ri.

49:29.900 --> 49:31.760
Wake up, Bo-ri.

-Please help.
-My gosh, what is going on?

50:10.970 --> 50:12.440
What bad timing.

50:12.700 --> 50:15.040
I cannot believe the owner
of the delicacy restaurant suddenly died.

50:16.440 --> 50:17.980
The mountain path is dangerous.

-Drag her out.
-Understood.

51:03.160 --> 51:05.260
It is a shame a young lady passed away,

51:05.420 --> 51:07.190
but it is an accident that can happen.

51:09.330 --> 51:10.930
But this is too much.

-Should we say a word to them?

Even if we are from the low class

51:40.560 --> 51:44.060

how can you not give us time to grief?

51:44.230 --> 51:45.330
So what?

51:46.570 --> 51:50.640
As her friend, are you willing to see
her off until the doors of the next world?

They took the body inside, so it seems
like they will undergo an investigation.

52:58.040 --> 53:00.410
They did not go easy on it at all.

53:00.840 --> 53:02.840
Something must be fishy.

-Go?
-Go where?

53:10.480 --> 53:12.150
Did I not tell you?

53:13.250 --> 53:15.150
I will never get myself involved
in state affairs

53:15.250 --> 53:17.360
and return home
after I enjoy some food here.

53:19.390 --> 53:21.290
It is not something
I can help with either.

53:22.030 --> 53:23.600

and it is not because I am lazy.

54:10.540 --> 54:12.910
prepare a house
for us to live in and a horse,

54:13.450 --> 54:17.450
I laid my hands on the vessel carrying
the taxes as the justice head told me to.

54:17.950 --> 54:19.890
You laid your hands on the vessel?

54:20.290 --> 54:22.850
-My Lord!
-I did not know that would happen.

54:28.430 --> 54:30.960
In order to run away
before things get worse,

we need this ledger.

-You want me to bury her right away?
-Yes!

54:57.260 --> 54:59.090
-But I am supposed to--
-Supposed to what?

54:59.220 --> 55:01.190
Get rid of her! Burn her!
Just do whatever you can!

55:01.390 --> 55:03.600

-Go get the carrier!
-The carrier!

56:06.190 --> 56:08.230
Go and burn the body as fast as you can.

56:08.290 --> 56:10.530
Burn the body? What do you mean?

56:10.960 --> 56:13.630
I will do the funeral
and bury her in her grave, my lord.

How can you not let us have a funeral

56:29.250 --> 56:31.380
and take the body away
on the same day she died?

56:34.620 --> 56:37.020
Why must you be so cruel?

56:37.890 --> 56:39.320
Having a lowly status does not mean

56:39.390 --> 56:41.660
we must get cremated
on the day of our death.

56:41.730 --> 56:43.430
Step aside, woman.

56:43.760 --> 56:45.260

to change her into hemp clothes?

57:52.830 --> 57:54.430
Hurry.

58:03.840 --> 58:05.580

58:07.780 --> 58:10.520
You cannot do this. But she...

58:12.980 --> 58:15.520
She had a baby growing inside her.

58:15.850 --> 58:17.390

-It seems like it.

58:24.000 --> 58:25.730
Was she trying to take a bath?

58:25.800 --> 58:28.570
A bath? A bath, she says.

58:30.170 --> 58:31.900
-My lord!
-My lord, we must go.

58:31.970 --> 58:34.470
How can you treat us this way?

58:38.540 --> 58:39.680
Strike that.

58:39.840 --> 58:41.980
There is no point
in painting a story of my own.

58:42.850 --> 58:43.880
We should go.

58:45.880 --> 58:46.890
Sure.

58:48.720 --> 58:50.420
Darn, what a nuisance.

58:50.590 --> 58:52.720
After I look into this one thing,
we will leave.

59:03.640 --> 59:04.800
What? He is...

59:05.500 --> 59:07.070
My gosh.

59:07.210 --> 59:09.970
Where did you find him?

59:11.080 --> 59:15.050
Something heavy got caught in my net.

59:15.350 --> 59:17.520
I fished it out
thinking it could be a shark, but...

59:19.980 --> 59:21.090
But...

59:21.950 --> 59:25.120
he was dealt with
on the tax shipping freighter that sank.

59:22.790 --> 59:27.430
[Jowoonsun: A tax shipping freighter]

59:26.560 --> 59:27.760
Then

59:27.830 --> 59:30.060
could he have been
shipped to shore with us?

59:31.230 --> 59:33.930
My lord, the ledger is still with me,

59:34.370 --> 59:37.270
so all might be well
if we manage to dispose of the body.

59:38.300 --> 59:40.610
The... ledger!

59:41.670 --> 59:43.410
We need this ledger.

59:43.470 --> 59:45.410
That is the only
way we can save our lives.

59:45.880 --> 59:46.880
But my lord...

59:47.680 --> 59:48.710
No!

59:50.110 --> 59:53.890
You must know where it was hidden.

59:53.950 --> 59:56.520
I was in so much distress

59:57.020 --> 59:58.660
that I did not ask.

1:00:00.990 --> 1:00:01.960
What?

1:00:02.390 --> 1:00:04.460
For now, while no one is watching,

1:00:04.530 --> 1:00:06.800
move the body.

1:00:06.860 --> 1:00:08.470
You heard him. Get it up.

1:00:08.530 --> 1:00:09.970
Move the body!

1:00:10.900 --> 1:00:12.470
-Hurry.
-If I were you,

1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:14.770
I would keep silent to save my life.

1:00:14.840 --> 1:00:17.010
I am well aware of that, my lord.

1:00:19.610 --> 1:00:20.750
Hurry.

1:00:23.980 --> 1:00:25.820
Hurry up!

1:00:33.860 --> 1:00:36.330
Come on. Hurry this way.

1:00:38.500 --> 1:00:40.300
Move out of our way!

1:00:41.870 --> 1:00:43.530
Please lower your gazes!

1:01:36.020 --> 1:01:37.060
Hurry.

1:02:00.880 --> 1:02:02.450
Come forth!

1:02:14.460 --> 1:02:16.030
Come forth!

1:02:29.310 --> 1:02:31.140
[The scenes with animals
were safely filmed.]

1:02:44.290 --> 1:02:46.090
[We thank Lee Jun-hyuk, Song Jong-ho, and
Jo Kwan-woo for their special appearance.]

1:02:46.690 --> 1:02:49.130
[Secret Royal Inspector Joy]

1:02:49.490 --> 1:02:51.930
Where is the ledger? Where is it?

1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:53.700
[So she has no belongings left.]

1:02:53.830 --> 1:02:55.630
How dare you, boy.

1:02:55.700 --> 1:02:56.970
-You!
-Why?

1:02:57.030 --> 1:02:58.700
How dare you!

1:02:58.970 --> 1:03:00.870
[Eliminating a secret royal inspector
should not be difficult.]

1:03:00.940 --> 1:03:02.340
[Rip them apart if you need to.]

1:03:02.410 --> 1:03:03.940
What we need is the ledger.

1:03:04.080 --> 1:03:07.080
[Could he have been murdered
but covered up as an accidental death?]

1:03:07.180 --> 1:03:08.210
[You must be careful.]

1:03:08.280 --> 1:03:10.250
[But this is from the government office.]

1:03:10.310 --> 1:03:12.620
[Can I report
my husband and mother-in-law?]

1:03:12.980 --> 1:03:15.090
♫ -Secret royal inspector
-Secret royal inspector ♫

1:03:15.150 --> 1:03:16.950
As of this moment,
I will take over the case.
