- Oh.

45:57.222 --> 45:59.222

- Oh, no.

is the card of temptation.

something powerful, wild.

46:17.842 --> 46:22.011

or he may enslave you."

Is he a child?

46:48.138 --> 46:50.439
- No, not necessarily.

46:50.441 --> 46:52.141
He's a messenger.

46:52.143 --> 46:55.878
Who, um...

46:55.880 --> 46:57.914
Let me see.

46:57.916 --> 47:00.583
He is like a child,
this messenger.

47:00.585 --> 47:03.219
He is very sensitive.

47:03.221 --> 47:06.122
You must be clear with him
or he may misunderstand you.

47:09.459 --> 47:11.327
- There you are.

47:11.329 --> 47:13.830
I've been lookin' everywhere
for you.

47:15.566 --> 47:18.901
I'm headed down to the bonfire.
You wanna come?

47:18.903 --> 47:22.605
- Can I meet you there
in a bit?

47:22.607 --> 47:24.607

47:37.855 --> 47:40.056

47:40.058 --> 47:43.392
He never gives up, though.

47:43.394 --> 47:45.595
I gotta give him that.

47:45.597 --> 47:47.597
- Yeah.

47:47.599 --> 47:51.968
[distant chatter, laughter]

47:51.970 --> 47:54.403
- How old were you
when it began?

47:56.206 --> 47:59.275
- I was 31 years old.

47:59.277 --> 48:02.478
I remember promising myself
I'd get to 35.

48:02.480 --> 48:05.314
I'd make it through
till then.

48:06.617 --> 48:10.086
And if nothing had changed,

48:10.088 --> 48:12.088
Well, then,
I had tried hard enough.

48:14.625 --> 48:16.392
And cole,
cole was getting better.

48:16.394 --> 48:18.561
He was recovering.

48:18.563 --> 48:20.563
It was impossible for me.

48:20.565 --> 48:23.032
And I was so angry at him.

48:23.034 --> 48:26.168
I thought it seemed almost evil
to be happy.

48:34.544 --> 48:36.112

48:42.053 --> 48:43.653

- Oh.

48:43.655 --> 48:47.523
- I was just on my way to check
out that bonfire over there.

48:47.525 --> 48:49.292

48:49.294 --> 48:51.394
- You coming from there,
or you--

48:51.396 --> 48:55.131
- I, um--no, I, uh--

48:55.133 --> 48:58.567
- Well, too bad.
I could've used an introduction.

48:58.569 --> 49:00.569

49:00.571 --> 49:04.273

Ditch plains.

49:04.275 --> 49:05.541
What about you?

49:05.543 --> 49:08.010
- Just right over there,
actually

49:08.012 --> 49:10.146
- Really?

49:10.148 --> 49:12.415
- Oh, it's not my house.
It belongs to my father-in-law.

49:12.417 --> 49:15.418

bruce butler?

49:15.420 --> 49:17.320

No, please, it's okay.

49:41.446 --> 49:44.613
- No, I-I don't smoke.
- Neither do I.

49:44.615 --> 49:46.649
- You were offering me
a cigarette.

49:46.651 --> 49:48.517
- Yeah, I know.
I should amend that.

49:48.519 --> 49:50.519
I don't smoke
except when I'm on vacation.

49:50.521 --> 49:53.189
And even then, I only let myself
smoke french cigarettes.

49:53.191 --> 49:55.091
- Why?

49:55.093 --> 49:56.726
- It's a self-regulatory
mechanism

50:28.359 --> 50:30.359
I've been wondering how I could
possibly ever repay you.

50:30.361 --> 50:32.128

do anything. I--

I don't know why I did that.
