04:53.255 --> 04:57.746
Fair Hippolyta, our
nuptial hour draws on apace.

04:57.748 --> 05:00.915
Four happy days bring in another moon.

05:01.797 --> 05:04.748
But oh, methinks how
slow this old moon wanes.

05:04.750 --> 05:06.667
She lingers my desires.

05:07.568 --> 05:11.299
Four days will quickly
steep themselves in night.

05:11.301 --> 05:15.051
Four nights will quickly
dream away the time.

05:17.901 --> 05:19.823
Hippolyta, I will wed thee with pomp,

05:19.825 --> 05:22.774
with triumph, and with reveling.

05:22.776 --> 05:25.399
Tonight, four day mourning time.

05:25.401 --> 05:30.068
We jump along the streets
all covered in mud and paint.

05:42.325 --> 05:44.985
Go, go go, go, go.

05:55.662 --> 05:58.959
You do realize there's
no water in that bucket.

06:17.771 --> 06:19.771
Stand forth Demetrius.

06:24.020 --> 06:27.389
This man hath my consent
to marry my daughter.

06:36.821 --> 06:40.870
This man hath bewitched
the bosom of my child,

06:40.872 --> 06:43.544
turned her obedience which is due to me

06:43.546 --> 06:45.685
to stubborn harshness.

06:45.687 --> 06:50.371
Be it so, she will not consent
to marry with Demetrius.

06:50.373 --> 06:51.920
What say you Hermia?

06:51.922 --> 06:54.295
Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.

06:54.297 --> 06:55.522
So is Lysander.

06:55.524 --> 06:57.610
Relent, sweet Hermia.

06:57.612 --> 07:01.445
I am, sir, as well derived
as he, as well possessed,

07:01.447 --> 07:03.570
my love is more than his, my fortunes

07:03.572 --> 07:06.221
every way as fairly ranked
if not with vantage.

07:06.223 --> 07:09.096
And which is more than
all these boasts can be,

07:09.098 --> 07:11.646
I am beloved the beauteous Hermia.

07:11.648 --> 07:13.422
Why should not I then prosecute my right?

07:13.424 --> 07:17.220
Lysander, yield thy crazed
title to my certain right.

07:17.222 --> 07:18.761
You have her father's love, Demetrius.

07:18.763 --> 07:20.634
Let me have Hermia's.

07:20.636 --> 07:22.053
Do you marry him?

07:23.938 --> 07:25.166
Enough.

07:25.168 --> 07:28.835
I would my father
looked but with my eyes.

07:29.918 --> 07:32.918
No, rather your eyes must
with his judgment look.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.368
What is the worst that may befall me

07:34.370 --> 07:37.787
in the case if I refuse to wed Demetrius?

07:38.845 --> 07:41.570
You will forsake all rights
to your land and wealth,

07:41.572 --> 07:44.743
not to mention your father's love.

07:44.745 --> 07:48.495
Therefore, fair Hermia
question your desires.

07:49.446 --> 07:51.872
My soul consents not
to give sovereignty.

07:51.874 --> 07:54.045
Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head,

07:54.047 --> 07:58.894
made love to Nedar's daughter
Helena and won her soul.

07:58.896 --> 08:02.396
And she, sweet lady dotes, devoutly dotes,

08:03.350 --> 08:07.081
dotes in idolatry upon this
spotted and inconstant man.

08:07.083 --> 08:09.126
I must confess that
I have heard so much.

08:09.128 --> 08:11.415
I have some private
schooling for you both.

08:11.417 --> 08:12.750
Come, Hippolyta.

08:14.350 --> 08:15.933
What cheer my love?

08:19.491 --> 08:21.908
Demetrius and Egeus go along.

08:23.961 --> 08:26.910
And you fair Hermia, take time to pause

08:26.912 --> 08:30.685
and by the next new moon
either prepare to wed Demetrius

08:30.687 --> 08:33.020
or to lose your inheritance.

08:44.009 --> 08:45.009
Demetrius.

09:02.732 --> 09:06.232
Ay me, for aught that I could ever read,

09:07.084 --> 09:09.150
could ever hear by tale or history,

09:09.152 --> 09:11.586
the course of true love
never did run smooth.

09:11.588 --> 09:15.255
Oh hell, to choose
love by another's eyes.

09:18.210 --> 09:19.710
Hear me, Hermia.

09:21.259 --> 09:24.808
I have a widow aunt, a
dowager of great revenue

09:24.810 --> 09:26.432
and she hath no child.

09:26.434 --> 09:29.850
And she respects me as her only son.

09:29.852 --> 09:31.519
There gentle Hermia,

09:33.510 --> 09:34.927
may I marry thee?

09:41.840 --> 09:43.423
But what of that?

09:44.357 --> 09:46.357
Demetrius thinks not so.

09:48.198 --> 09:51.322
He only knows what all but he do know.

09:51.324 --> 09:55.305
Love looks not with the
eyes, but with the mind.

09:55.307 --> 09:58.606
And therefore is winged
Cupid painted blind.

09:58.608 --> 10:01.322
And when this hail some heat from Hermia.

10:01.324 --> 10:03.407
God speed, fair Helena.

10:11.224 --> 10:12.889
Call you me fair?

10:12.891 --> 10:14.773
That fair again unsay.

10:14.775 --> 10:17.607
Demetrius loves your fair.

10:17.609 --> 10:18.776
Oh happy fair.

10:20.625 --> 10:21.548
Oh teach me how you look

10:21.550 --> 10:24.482
and with what art you sway the
motion of Demetrius's heart.

10:24.484 --> 10:27.919
I give him curses, yet he gives me love.

10:27.921 --> 10:30.253
Oh that my prayers
could such affection move.

10:30.255 --> 10:32.384
The more I hate, the more he follows me.

10:32.386 --> 10:35.985
The more I love, the more he hateth me.

10:35.987 --> 10:39.709
His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.

10:39.711 --> 10:42.909
None but your beauty,
would that fault were mine.

10:42.911 --> 10:47.109
Take comfort, he no
more shall see my face.

10:47.111 --> 10:50.086
Lysander and myself will fly this place.

10:50.088 --> 10:53.235
Helen, to you our minds we will unfold.

10:53.237 --> 10:56.060
Tonight, from the revelry I'll fly.

10:56.062 --> 10:57.960
And in the wood, a
league without a town.

10:57.962 --> 11:00.478
We two will meet and turn away our eyes.

11:00.480 --> 11:03.776
To seek new friends
and stranger companies.

11:03.778 --> 11:04.885
Tonight?

11:04.887 --> 11:05.735
Tonight.

11:05.737 --> 11:06.570
Tonight.

11:08.580 --> 11:09.830
Hermia!

11:17.788 --> 11:21.411
Farewell sweet playfellow,
pray thou for us.

11:21.413 --> 11:24.663
And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius.

11:26.563 --> 11:27.813
Helen, adieu.

11:28.913 --> 11:31.996
As you on him, Demetrius dote on you.

12:31.440 --> 12:32.864

13:51.110 --> 13:52.675
I know what I want to do.

14:09.244 --> 14:12.615
We shall perform a play
never before seen in Barbados

14:12.617 --> 14:14.190
or the world.

14:14.192 --> 14:17.442
It shall be called King Jaja and Becca.

14:18.368 --> 14:22.766
The Untold Love story of
King Jaja and Young Becca.

14:22.768 --> 14:24.717
Oh!

14:24.719 --> 14:27.616
The tragic untold story of King Jaja.

14:27.618 --> 14:29.840
Quincy, say what the play treats on,

14:29.842 --> 14:33.091
then read the name of the
actors, and so grow to a point.

14:33.093 --> 14:33.924
What she say?

14:33.926 --> 14:36.319
She said to hurry up and
say what the play about,

14:36.321 --> 14:38.492
and who playing what.

14:38.494 --> 14:41.017
What can't she ever
speak normal English?

14:41.019 --> 14:43.217
Now a lot of people
don't know this, right?

14:43.219 --> 14:46.686
But Barbados was once the
home to a Nigerian prince

14:46.688 --> 14:48.435
named King Jaja.

14:48.437 --> 14:50.718
He was a slave and he
worked the way up the ranks

14:50.720 --> 14:52.293
to become one of the richest,

14:52.295 --> 14:56.043
most powerful businessmen in Nigeria.

14:56.045 --> 14:58.889
So you know the Brits had a
serious problem with that.

14:58.891 --> 15:00.974
They arrest him and bring all kind

15:00.976 --> 15:02.881
of false charges against him.

15:02.883 --> 15:05.490
And eventually kick he out to Africa.

15:05.492 --> 15:08.340
But he came to Barbados and it's there

15:08.342 --> 15:11.590
that he met a young sexy girl named Becca.

15:11.592 --> 15:14.140
But there's a folk song 'bout it, man.

15:56.923 --> 16:01.525
But Becca and Jaja have a love
affair that was forbidden.

16:01.527 --> 16:03.772
So in fear they run away.

16:03.774 --> 16:07.295
All you keep hearing
is that Jaja gets sick

16:07.297 --> 16:10.516
and he died on his way back to Nigeria

16:10.518 --> 16:13.846
and Becca was never seen again.

16:13.848 --> 16:15.391
Nobody knows what happened.

16:15.393 --> 16:19.097
But I feel that they would rather die

16:19.099 --> 16:21.525
than to let go of true love.

16:21.527 --> 16:23.586
It got to be an important story,

16:23.588 --> 16:25.697
otherwise would they
write a song about it?

16:25.699 --> 16:28.552
Now, we can do a play about it.

16:28.554 --> 16:29.484
Yeah, man.

16:29.486 --> 16:30.317
Yeah.

16:30.319 --> 16:32.508
Just like Romeo and Juliet.

16:32.510 --> 16:34.109
Bottom.

16:34.111 --> 16:34.944
Ready.

16:36.036 --> 16:40.084
You name the part what
I'm for and proceed.

16:40.086 --> 16:44.559
You Bottom have been cast
as the lover King Jaja.

16:44.561 --> 16:46.209
A king?

16:46.211 --> 16:47.960
I am to play a man?

16:49.884 --> 16:51.784
Well, that will ask for some tears

16:51.786 --> 16:53.510
in the true performing of it.

16:53.512 --> 16:57.734
If I am to do it, let the
audience look to their eyes.

16:57.736 --> 16:59.660
I will move storms.

16:59.662 --> 17:01.184
Hmm.

17:01.186 --> 17:04.353
Ah, but he was also a brave soldier.

17:09.811 --> 17:10.645
Idiots.

17:13.794 --> 17:15.544
You will play Becca.

17:17.344 --> 17:18.756
You can't make me play a woman.

17:18.758 --> 17:20.714
Look, I'm growing a beard.

17:20.717 --> 17:22.974
Well, wear a mask.

17:22.977 --> 17:24.810
And try to make your voice
as high as it can go.

17:24.813 --> 17:26.189
I will play Becca's father.

17:26.191 --> 17:28.941
Sinker, you are the steel donkey.

17:33.544 --> 17:34.377
Hee haw.

17:36.524 --> 17:38.066
You got your lines written down?

17:38.068 --> 17:41.531
Because I think I'll
start learning for early.

17:41.533 --> 17:43.905
Man, look, you can
improvise the whole part.

17:43.907 --> 17:46.198
It's nothing but neigh.

17:46.200 --> 17:48.294
Let me do the steel donkey too.

17:48.296 --> 17:53.296
I will neigh that I will do any
man's heart good to hear me.

17:54.976 --> 17:55.809
Bottom.

17:58.267 --> 17:59.100
Neigh.

18:02.192 --> 18:03.951
Oh, shoot.

18:03.953 --> 18:04.786
Bottom.

18:07.728 --> 18:10.652
You can play no part but the king.

18:10.654 --> 18:14.516
For Jaja is a sweet
faced man, a proper man,

18:14.518 --> 18:17.092
as one shall see in a summer's day.

18:17.094 --> 18:20.177
A most lovely and gentleman like man.

18:22.257 --> 18:25.856
You the only one who can play King Jaja.

18:25.858 --> 18:28.356
Well, I will undertake it.

18:28.358 --> 18:29.679
Yeah, all right.

18:29.681 --> 18:30.514
Come.

18:35.610 --> 18:39.033
Meet me in the forest outside the village

18:39.035 --> 18:41.657
beneath the bearded fig tree.

18:41.659 --> 18:43.983
That's the best place to rehearse.

18:43.985 --> 18:46.364

And hailed down oaths
that he was only mine.

20:01.778 --> 20:02.644
Come on!

20:02.646 --> 20:05.701
I will go tell him of the lovers troth.

20:05.703 --> 20:08.926
Then will he up straight
and pursue them both.

20:08.928 --> 20:11.801
By this means seek I to enrich my pain

20:11.803 --> 20:15.220
to have his sight thither and back again.

22:10.002 --> 22:13.610
You are that shrewd and knavish sprite

22:13.612 --> 22:15.511
called Robin Goodfellow.

22:15.513 --> 22:17.435
I am that merry wanderer of the night.

22:17.437 --> 22:19.536
I jest with Oberon and make him smile.

22:19.538 --> 22:23.486
And I serve the fairy
queen to dew her orbs

22:23.488 --> 22:24.610
upon the green.

22:24.612 --> 22:27.359
The king doth keep
his revels here tonight.

22:27.361 --> 22:29.936
Take heed the queen come
not within his sight.

22:29.938 --> 22:32.002
For Oberon is passing fell and wrath

22:32.004 --> 22:35.463
because that she as her
attendant hath that lovely boy,

22:35.465 --> 22:37.828
stolen from a mortal king.

22:37.830 --> 22:41.136
She never had so sweet a changeling.

22:41.138 --> 22:44.677
Oberon, and here is my mistress.

22:44.679 --> 22:46.679
Would that he were gone.

23:54.528 --> 23:57.695
Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.

23:59.823 --> 24:01.240
Jealous Oberon.

24:03.030 --> 24:06.280
Fairies skip hence I have
forsworn his bed and company.

24:06.282 --> 24:08.276
Tarry, rash wanton.

24:08.278 --> 24:09.577
Am not I thy lord?

24:09.579 --> 24:11.746
Then I must be thy lady.

24:13.230 --> 24:16.802
Why should Titania cross her Oberon?

24:16.804 --> 24:19.576
I do but beg of thee a
little changeling boy

24:19.578 --> 24:20.577
to be my henchman.

24:20.579 --> 24:22.152
Your heart at rest the fairy land

24:22.154 --> 24:24.378
buys not the child of me.

24:24.380 --> 24:26.504
His mother had oft worshiped the same moon

24:26.506 --> 24:28.874
and in the spiced Indian air by night,

24:28.876 --> 24:31.480
full often hath she gossiped by my side

24:31.482 --> 24:34.456
and sat with me on blessed yellow sands

24:34.458 --> 24:37.906
marking the embarked traders on the flood.

24:37.908 --> 24:38.741
But she,

24:40.802 --> 24:43.635
being mortal, of that boy did die.

24:46.660 --> 24:49.608
And for her sake, do I rear up her boy

24:49.610 --> 24:53.193
and for her sake, I
will not part with him.

24:57.311 --> 24:58.894
Well, go thy way.

25:00.686 --> 25:03.458
Thou shalt not from this grove

25:03.460 --> 25:06.710

29:46.330 --> 29:49.428
as I can do with another herb.

I'll make her render up her child to me.

I love thee not
therefore, pursue me not.

30:05.256 --> 30:07.309
And even for that, I
do love you the more.

30:07.311 --> 30:09.580
Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?

30:09.582 --> 30:13.230
Thou toldest me they were
stolen unto this wood.

30:13.232 --> 30:17.712
Oh hence get thee gone
and follow me no more.

30:17.714 --> 30:19.318
Do I entice you?

30:19.320 --> 30:20.742
Do I speak you fair?

30:20.744 --> 30:23.445
Or rather do I not in
plainest truth tell you,

30:23.447 --> 30:26.030
I do not nor I cannot love you?

30:26.997 --> 30:30.395
You draw me you hard hearted adamant.

30:30.397 --> 30:32.696
I'll run from thee and
hide me in the brakes

30:32.698 --> 30:35.695
and leave thee to the
mercy of wild beasts.

30:35.697 --> 30:37.994
I'll follow thee and

31:03.177 --> 31:06.400

But do it so the next thing
he espies, may be the lady.

31:20.678 --> 31:24.651
Do it with some care so that he may prove

31:24.653 --> 31:27.986
more fond on her than she upon her love.

31:29.453 --> 31:33.596
And look thou ere fore

32:22.553 --> 32:24.429
Find you out a bed.

32:24.431 --> 32:27.681
For I upon this tree will rest my head.

32:29.158 --> 32:32.581
One turf shall
serve as pillow for us both.

32:32.583 --> 32:34.680

32:34.682 --> 32:39.682
For my sake my dear lie further
off yet, do not lie so near.

32:40.411 --> 32:43.334
Two bosoms interchained with an oath,

32:43.336 --> 32:46.710
so then two bosoms and a single troth.

32:46.712 --> 32:51.321
And by your side no bed room
me deny for lying so Hermia,

32:51.323 --> 32:52.406
I do not lie.

32:54.105 --> 32:57.188
Lysander, you riddle very prettily.

32:58.911 --> 33:02.244
But gentle friend, for love and courtesy

33:03.386 --> 33:06.866
lie further off in human modesty.

33:06.868 --> 33:08.674
Such separation may well be said

33:08.676 --> 33:12.072
becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid.

33:12.074 --> 33:16.157
So far, be distant, and
good night, sweet friend.

33:19.018 --> 33:22.595
Thy love never alter
till thy sweet life end.

33:22.597 --> 33:24.022
Amen.

33:24.024 --> 33:26.607
Amen to that fair prayer say I.

33:28.224 --> 33:30.974
Then end life when I end loyalty.

33:51.229 --> 33:55.896
This is he my master said
despised the love lorn maid.

33:58.630 --> 34:00.252
And here the maiden,

34:00.254 --> 34:03.921
sleeping sound on the
dank and dirty ground.

34:06.200 --> 34:07.200
Pretty soul.

34:08.054 --> 34:13.054
She durst not lie near this
lack love, this kill courtesy.

34:13.304 --> 34:15.638
Churl, upon thy eyes I throw

34:18.380 --> 34:21.214
all the power this charm doth owe.

34:22.080 --> 34:25.728
When thou wakest let love
forbid sleep his seat

34:25.730 --> 34:26.897
on thy eyelid.

34:27.978 --> 34:31.811
Awake when I am gone for
I must now to Oberon.

34:34.402 --> 34:35.596
Listen to what I'm saying.

34:35.598 --> 34:37.378
- Everybody can...
- No, you are playing Becca.

34:39.402 --> 34:41.105
I know, but
you're gonna play the part.

34:41.107 --> 34:43.607
I can't play Becca.

35:11.341 --> 35:12.932
Now according to what it say,

35:12.934 --> 35:16.434
King Jaja and Becca used to speak through,

35:19.529 --> 35:22.612
through a hole in the galvanize, huh?

35:23.702 --> 35:24.903
What?

35:24.905 --> 35:27.155
But this ain't dangerous?

35:29.348 --> 35:32.251
Man, you gotta think
health and safety, Quincy.

35:32.253 --> 35:33.629
You can't be serious, man.

35:33.631 --> 35:36.757
I know, let Sinker
also play the galvanize.

35:36.759 --> 35:37.806
- Me?
- Oh, yes.

35:37.808 --> 35:40.003
Let him hold his finger thus

35:40.005 --> 35:42.304
and then King Jaja and Becca

35:42.306 --> 35:46.902
can be spoke to each
other through that crack.

35:46.904 --> 35:50.154
All right, all right,
well that settles it, okay.

35:50.156 --> 35:52.186
That settles it, let's start.

35:52.188 --> 35:55.938
Now King Jaja, you will
say your lines first.

35:57.107 --> 35:59.208
And then afterwards, you
will hide behind the bush.

35:59.210 --> 36:01.401
In fact, I want everyone behind the bush

36:01.403 --> 36:03.570
when they're not on stage.

36:04.807 --> 36:05.890
Dear Becca,

36:06.793 --> 36:10.876
I want to bask in the
ambulance of your radiance.

36:13.377 --> 36:15.925
The ambience of your radiance.

36:15.927 --> 36:18.192
Ambience of your radiance.

36:18.194 --> 36:19.825
Yes.

36:19.827 --> 36:21.972
But what's that?

36:21.974 --> 36:22.807
A voice?

36:23.900 --> 36:26.400
Wait here, I'll be right back.

36:33.048 --> 36:35.381
Go behind the bush, right.

36:37.101 --> 36:38.550
Am I supposed to speak now?

36:38.552 --> 36:41.275
Yes, yes, you're supposed to show

36:41.277 --> 36:43.426
that you understand that King Jaja

36:43.428 --> 36:44.951
heard a noise and is going to check on it

36:44.953 --> 36:47.251
but he'll be back soon.

36:47.253 --> 36:49.001
Most handsome Jaja.

36:49.003 --> 36:50.253
No, as Becca.

36:53.069 --> 36:54.262
Most handsome Jaja.

36:55.664 --> 36:56.497
Sorry.

36:58.614 --> 37:01.562
I will meet you at
the constipation statue.

37:01.564 --> 37:04.638
My love for you grows by every second.

37:04.640 --> 37:06.473
Emancipation statue.

37:07.439 --> 37:10.862
All right, Sinker you missed your cue.

37:10.864 --> 37:14.063
You're supposed to enter and say neigh

37:14.065 --> 37:15.425
when you hear the word second.

37:15.427 --> 37:17.677
Oh sorry, neigh.

37:18.602 --> 37:19.724
Louder, Sinker.

37:19.726 --> 37:20.559
Neigh!

37:24.326 --> 37:25.159
Neigh!

37:27.602 --> 37:28.519
Neigh, baa.

37:31.395 --> 37:33.228
Like this Sinker, baa!

37:35.999 --> 37:38.332
Call the boys back!

37:39.834 --> 37:42.667
This is a joke just to scare me.

37:43.524 --> 37:47.147
I will walk upon down
here and I will sing...

37:47.149 --> 37:50.566
that they shall hear that I'm not afraid.

39:30.728 --> 39:35.252

have little reason for that.

39:35.254 --> 39:38.153
And yet to say the truth reason and love

39:38.155 --> 39:41.550
keep little company together nowadays.

39:41.552 --> 39:44.969
Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.

Not so neither.

But if I had wit enough
to get out of this wood,

39:51.231 --> 39:53.951
I have enough to serve mine own turn.

39:53.953 --> 39:56.353
Out of this wood do not desire to go.

The more my prayer,
the lesser is my grace.

41:58.080 --> 42:01.596
We cannot fight for love as men may do.

42:01.598 --> 42:05.265
We should be wooed and
were not made to woo.

Lysander?

Lysander?

Lysander, if you live good sir, awake.

42:32.496 --> 42:34.570
Lysander, where is Demetrius?

42:34.572 --> 42:36.545
Oh, how fit
a word is that vile name

42:36.547 --> 42:37.865
to perish on my sword.

42:37.867 --> 42:41.796
Do not say so, Lysander, say not so.

42:41.798 --> 42:44.015
What though he love your Hermia?

42:44.017 --> 42:45.740
Lord what though?

42:45.742 --> 42:48.422
Yet Hermia still loves
you, then be content.

42:48.424 --> 42:49.971
Content with Hermia?

42:49.973 --> 42:50.806
No.

42:51.924 --> 42:55.114
I do repent the tedious
minutes I with her have spent.

42:55.116 --> 42:57.616
Not Hermia, but Helena I love.

42:58.824 --> 43:00.971
Who will not change a raven for a dove?

43:00.973 --> 43:03.620
Wherefore was I to
this keen mockery born?

43:03.622 --> 43:05.290
Good troth, you do me wrong.

43:05.292 --> 43:08.946
Good sooth you do in such
disdainful manner me to woo.

43:08.948 --> 43:11.772
But fare you well,
perforce I must confess,

43:11.774 --> 43:14.122
I thought you lord of
more true gentleness.

43:14.124 --> 43:14.957
Helena!

43:15.975 --> 43:16.808
Helena!

43:20.773 --> 43:22.046
Help me, Lysander!

43:22.048 --> 43:24.576
Help me, do thy best to
pluck this crawling serpent

43:24.578 --> 43:25.828
from my breast.

43:28.626 --> 43:29.459
Lysander?

43:32.910 --> 43:34.660
Alack, where are you?

43:37.185 --> 43:38.018
Hermia!

43:48.682 --> 43:49.599
Lysander?

43:53.836 --> 43:55.503
Helena?

43:59.161 --> 44:00.161
Demetrius!

44:02.656 --> 44:03.489
Demetrius?

44:08.186 --> 44:09.019
Titania.

44:24.256 --> 44:27.478
Wonder if Titania be awake.

44:27.480 --> 44:30.980
Then what it was next that came in her eye

44:34.036 --> 44:37.334
which she must dote on in extremity?

44:37.336 --> 44:40.669
My mistress with a monster is in love.

44:55.537 --> 44:58.787
This falls out better
than I could devise.

44:58.789 --> 45:01.836
But hast thou latched the
youths eyes with the love juice,

45:01.838 --> 45:03.011
as I did bid thee do?

45:03.013 --> 45:06.680
I took him sleeping,
that is finished too.

45:08.085 --> 45:12.253
Stick close, this is the self same one.

45:12.255 --> 45:16.136
This is the woman
but not this the man.

45:16.138 --> 45:16.978
Dog!

45:16.980 --> 45:18.311
Out cur!

45:18.313 --> 45:21.537
Thou drivest me past the
bounds of maiden's patience.

45:21.539 --> 45:23.235
Hast thou slain him then?

45:23.237 --> 45:26.404
I am not guilty of Lysander's blood.

45:31.914 --> 45:35.747
There is no following
her in this fierce vein.

46:01.915 --> 46:03.748
What hast thou done?

46:05.310 --> 46:08.339
Thou hast mistaken quite
and laid the love juice

46:08.341 --> 46:10.508
on some true love's sight.

46:11.467 --> 46:14.014
About the wood, go swifter than the wind

46:14.016 --> 46:16.413
and fairest Helena look thou find.

46:16.415 --> 46:19.915
By some illusion, see thou bring her here.

46:34.942 --> 46:39.025
Flower of this red dye,
hit with Cupid's archery.

46:41.265 --> 46:43.966
Sink in the apple of his eye.

46:43.968 --> 46:46.635
When his true love he doth espy,

46:48.192 --> 46:52.525
let her shine as gloriously
as the Venus of the sky.

47:02.443 --> 47:03.276
Helena.

47:04.392 --> 47:07.866
Why should you think that
I should woo in scorn?

47:07.868 --> 47:10.618
Look when I vow, I weep, I swoon,

47:12.093 --> 47:12.924
I am torn.

47:12.926 --> 47:14.866
These vows are Hermia's.

47:14.868 --> 47:16.166
Will you give her o'er?

47:16.168 --> 47:18.091
I had no
judgment when to her I swore.

47:18.093 --> 47:21.516
Nor none in my mind
now you give her o'er.

47:24.319 --> 47:25.152
Demetrius?

47:40.640 --> 47:41.473
Demetrius.

47:42.419 --> 47:47.002
Demetrius loves
her, and he loves not you.

47:48.766 --> 47:50.517
Oh, Helena.

47:55.716 --> 47:56.966
Goddess, nymph,

47:59.189 --> 48:00.522
perfect, divine.

48:02.589 --> 48:06.064
Oh, to what my love to what
shall I compare thine eyne?

48:06.066 --> 48:08.239
Crystal is muddy.

48:08.241 --> 48:10.389
Oh how ripe in show thy lips,

48:10.391 --> 48:13.431
those kissing cherries tempting grow.

48:13.433 --> 48:15.664
Oh spite, oh hell.

48:15.666 --> 48:18.188
I see you all are bent to set
against me for your merriment.

48:18.190 --> 48:21.091
You are unkind, Demetrius, be not so.

48:21.093 --> 48:23.340
For you love Hermia, this you know I know.

48:23.342 --> 48:26.591
Lysander, keep thy Hermia I will none.

48:26.593 --> 48:28.679
Helen, it is not so.

48:28.681 --> 48:31.011
Disparage not the
faith thou dost not know.

48:31.013 --> 48:31.930
Lysander.

48:33.393 --> 48:36.091
Why unkindly didst thou leave me so?

48:36.093 --> 48:38.916
Why should he stay whom
love does press to go?

48:38.918 --> 48:41.391
What love could press
Lysander from my side?

48:41.393 --> 48:45.666
Lysander's love that
would not let him bide.

48:45.668 --> 48:48.142
Fair Helena, who more engilds the night

48:48.144 --> 48:52.365
than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light.

48:52.367 --> 48:55.191
You speak not as you
think, it cannot be.

48:55.193 --> 48:58.276
Lo, she is one of this confederacy.

48:59.744 --> 49:01.886
Have you not set Lysander as in scorn

49:01.888 --> 49:04.292
to follow me and praise my eyes and face?

49:04.294 --> 49:06.410
And made your other love, Demetrius,

49:06.412 --> 49:09.366
who even but did now
spurn me with his foot

49:09.368 --> 49:12.201
to call me goddess, nymph, divine,

49:13.669 --> 49:15.836
rare, precious, celestial?

49:18.412 --> 49:22.236
I understand not what you mean by this.

49:22.238 --> 49:26.285
If you have any pity, grace or manners,

49:26.287 --> 49:29.493
you would not make me such an argument.

49:29.495 --> 49:32.318
But fare ye well, 'tis partly my own fault

49:32.320 --> 49:35.418
which death or absence soon shall remedy.

49:35.420 --> 49:38.493
Stay, gentle Helena, hear my excuse.

49:38.495 --> 49:42.543
Lord what fools these mortals be, cha.

49:42.545 --> 49:46.311
My love, my life, my soul, fair Helena.

49:46.313 --> 49:47.718
Oh excellent.

49:47.720 --> 49:49.168
Sweet, do not scorn her so.

49:49.170 --> 49:52.794
Helen, I love thee, by my life I do.

49:52.796 --> 49:55.393
I say I love thee more than he can do.

49:55.395 --> 49:57.595
If thou say so withdraw
and prove it too.

49:57.597 --> 49:59.810
Lysander, whereto tends all this?

49:59.812 --> 50:01.054
Away you land shark.

50:01.056 --> 50:03.654
No, no, he'll seem to break loose.

50:03.656 --> 50:05.573
Vile thing let loose.

50:17.203 --> 50:18.036
Oh me.

50:22.258 --> 50:23.675
You house hopper.

50:24.609 --> 50:26.705
You fartblossom.

50:26.707 --> 50:28.406
You thief of love!

50:28.408 --> 50:29.801
What have you come by night

50:29.803 --> 50:31.933
and stolen my love's heart from him?

50:31.935 --> 50:32.857
What?

50:32.859 --> 50:35.932
Will you tear impatient
answers from my gentle tongue?

50:35.934 --> 50:38.107
You yard fowl, you idiot you!

50:38.109 --> 50:39.832
Yard fowl?

50:39.834 --> 50:41.891
Have you grown so high in his esteem

50:41.893 --> 50:44.941
because I am so dwarfish and so low?

50:44.943 --> 50:48.365
How low am I thou painted maypole?

50:48.367 --> 50:49.741
Speak!

50:49.743 --> 50:50.826
How low am I?

50:52.818 --> 50:55.441
I am not yet so low but that my nails

50:55.443 --> 50:57.610
can reach unto thine eyes.

51:05.543 --> 51:08.376
Helena!

51:22.570 --> 51:26.138
Good Hermia, do not
be so bitter with me.

51:26.140 --> 51:28.807
I evermore did love you, Hermia.

51:30.291 --> 51:32.314
Demetrius followed you.

51:32.316 --> 51:34.816
For love, I followed him.

51:34.818 --> 51:39.115
But he hath chid me hence and
threatened me, to strike me,

51:39.117 --> 51:41.534
spurn me nay, to kill me too.

51:42.418 --> 51:44.085
Why get thee gone.

51:45.067 --> 51:47.141
Who is it that hinders you?

51:47.143 --> 51:49.241
A foolish heart that
I leave here behind.

51:49.243 --> 51:50.490
What, with Lysander?

51:50.492 --> 51:51.909
With Demetrius.

52:10.919 --> 52:13.267
You, mistress all this
coil is long of you.

52:13.269 --> 52:14.602
Nay go not back.

52:16.068 --> 52:17.467
I will not trust you aye,

52:17.469 --> 52:20.719
nor longer stay in your cursed company.

52:25.435 --> 52:27.428
Get you gone, you dwarf!

52:27.430 --> 52:30.409
Oh when she's angry
she is keen and shrewd.

52:30.411 --> 52:32.784
She was a vixen when she went to school.

52:32.786 --> 52:35.258
And though she be but
little, she is fierce.

52:35.260 --> 52:37.734
Little again, nothing
but low and little.

52:37.736 --> 52:39.319
Let me come to her.

52:43.412 --> 52:46.495
I am amazed and know not what to say.

52:58.762 --> 53:00.345
- Helena!
- Helena!

53:05.114 --> 53:07.086
This is thy negligence.

53:07.088 --> 53:09.012
Still thou mistakest.

53:09.014 --> 53:11.611
Or else committest thy
knaveries willfully?

53:11.613 --> 53:15.786
Believe me, King of Shadows, I mistook.

53:15.788 --> 53:18.121
Robin, overcast the night,

53:19.502 --> 53:22.638
and lead these testy rivals so astray

53:22.640 --> 53:25.723
as one come not within another's way.

53:29.814 --> 53:33.812
Crush this flower into Lysander's eye,

53:33.814 --> 53:37.136
whose liquor hath this virtuous property,

53:37.138 --> 53:40.888
to take from thence all
error with his might,

53:42.840 --> 53:46.590
and make his eyeballs
roll with wonted sight.

53:55.614 --> 53:59.738
Here will I rest me
till the break of day.

53:59.740 --> 54:03.407

gentle lover, remedy.

When thou wakest thou takest true delight

55:15.835 --> 55:18.362
in thy former lady's eye.

55:18.364 --> 55:21.864
Jack shall have Jill, nought shall go ill.

55:23.741 --> 55:26.574
The man shall have his mare again,

55:28.219 --> 55:30.052
and all shall be well.

55:45.111 --> 55:46.535
And now I have the boy,

55:46.537 --> 55:50.436
I will undo this hateful
imperfection of her eyes.

55:50.438 --> 55:54.636
And gentle Puck take
this transformed scalp

55:54.638 --> 55:57.260
from off the head of this homespun swain,

55:57.262 --> 56:00.494
that he awaking when the other do,

56:00.496 --> 56:04.163
may think no more of
this night's accidents,

56:06.496 --> 56:09.663
but as the fierce vexation of a dream.

56:59.602 --> 57:03.042
How came these things to pass?

57:03.044 --> 57:04.461
Silence awhile.

57:05.827 --> 57:07.910
Robin, take off his head.

57:10.527 --> 57:12.194
Titania, music call.

57:30.960 --> 57:35.579
Now when thou wakest with
thine own fool's eyes peep.

58:20.134 --> 58:21.134
Thank you.

58:33.769 --> 58:35.183
Good morrow, friends.

58:35.185 --> 58:37.185
I pray you all stand up.

58:41.443 --> 58:43.166
Pardon, sir.

58:43.168 --> 58:44.391
I know you two are rival enemies.

58:44.393 --> 58:46.841
How comes this gentle concord in the world

58:46.843 --> 58:48.315
that hatred is so far from jealousy

58:48.317 --> 58:50.569
to sleep by hate, and fear no enmity?

58:50.571 --> 58:53.071
Sir, I shall reply amazedly.

58:54.222 --> 58:57.066
Half sleep, half waking but as yet I swear

58:57.068 --> 58:59.985
I cannot truly say how I came here.

59:01.999 --> 59:03.999
But as I think so it is,

59:05.224 --> 59:07.391
I came with Hermia hither.

59:08.674 --> 59:09.545
Our intent was to...

59:09.547 --> 59:10.523
Enough!

59:10.525 --> 59:13.097
Dear Egeus, I know not by what power

59:13.099 --> 59:15.573
but by some power it is.

59:15.575 --> 59:18.658
My love to Hermia melted as the snow.

59:20.775 --> 59:23.372
And all my love is only Helena's.

59:23.374 --> 59:26.049
Fair lovers you are fortunately met.

59:26.051 --> 59:28.291
Of this discourse we shall hear more anon.

59:28.293 --> 59:30.687
Egeus, I will overbear your will,

59:30.689 --> 59:33.161
for in the chapel by and by with us,

59:33.163 --> 59:36.207
these couples shall eternally be knit.

59:36.209 --> 59:37.542
Come, Hippolyta.

59:48.884 --> 59:52.263
'Tis strange, my Theseus,
that these lovers speak of.

59:52.265 --> 59:54.223
More strange than true.

59:54.225 --> 59:57.288
Lovers and madmen have
such seething brains,

59:57.290 --> 59:59.309
such shaping fantasies as apprehend

59:59.311 --> 01:00:02.561
more than cool reason ever comprehends.

01:00:15.041 --> 01:00:18.958
When my cue comes, call
me and I will answer.

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:20.633
Quincy?

01:00:21.468 --> 01:00:23.023
Hook?

01:00:23.025 --> 01:00:24.108
Line, Sinker?

01:00:28.117 --> 01:00:28.950
My God.

01:00:30.725 --> 01:00:33.392
Stolen hence and left me asleep.

01:00:37.384 --> 01:00:39.884
I have had a most rare vision.

01:00:40.868 --> 01:00:43.007
I have had a dream past the wit of man

01:00:43.009 --> 01:00:45.092
to say what dream it was.

01:00:46.368 --> 01:00:47.701
Methought I was,

01:00:49.045 --> 01:00:50.545
methought I had...

01:00:54.744 --> 01:00:57.291
But man is but a patched
fool if he will offer to say

01:00:57.293 --> 01:00:59.043
what methought I had.

01:01:11.888 --> 01:01:15.680
I will get Peter Quince to
write a ballad of this dream.

01:01:15.682 --> 01:01:18.730
It shall be called Bottom's Dream,

01:01:18.732 --> 01:01:20.899

Nobody ain't hear from her.

01:02:17.843 --> 01:02:20.740
I think she get kidnapped.

01:02:20.742 --> 01:02:22.614
We can't do the play without her, right?

01:02:22.616 --> 01:02:25.366
Nope, that would be impossible.

01:02:26.869 --> 01:02:28.237
There's nobody in Barbados

01:02:28.239 --> 01:02:31.156
that can play King Jaja but Bottom.

01:02:34.572 --> 01:02:35.739
Poor Bottom.

01:02:36.919 --> 01:02:40.419
And she always wanted to go to London too.

01:02:42.995 --> 01:02:45.050
Where are these lads?

01:02:45.052 --> 01:02:46.686

01:02:46.688 --> 01:02:47.938
Bottom!

01:02:50.048 --> 01:02:53.668
I have something quite
amazing to tell you all.

01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:55.192
What happened?

01:02:55.194 --> 01:02:56.317
Later.

01:02:56.319 --> 01:02:59.481
Right now, we have to
get ready for our play.

01:03:00.395 --> 01:03:03.893
Dear actors, eat no onions nor garlic.

01:03:03.895 --> 01:03:06.668
For we are to utter sweet breath

01:03:06.670 --> 01:03:10.912
and I do not doubt but to hear
them say it is a sweet story.

01:03:12.744 --> 01:03:15.194
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:03:15.196 --> 01:03:16.545
Wait, wait, wait.

01:03:16.547 --> 01:03:17.617
What she say?

01:03:17.619 --> 01:03:18.450
Man.

01:03:18.452 --> 01:03:21.119
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:04:16.047 --> 01:04:17.796
Say, what abridgement
have you for this evening?

01:04:17.798 --> 01:04:19.322
What masque, what music?

01:04:19.324 --> 01:04:22.397
Is there no play to ease the
anguish of a torturing hour?

01:04:22.399 --> 01:04:25.597
Here is a list of the acts
that have been prepared.

01:04:25.599 --> 01:04:28.416
Amazing Grace sung by
an Anglican church choir.

01:04:28.418 --> 01:04:30.547
No, I want none of that.

01:04:30.549 --> 01:04:34.397
Romeo and Juliet, that's an old device.

01:04:34.399 --> 01:04:38.422
The Untold Love Story of
King Jaja and Young Becca.

01:04:38.424 --> 01:04:42.252
A very tragical mirth,
I shall hear that play.

01:04:42.254 --> 01:04:44.338
No sir, it is not for you.

01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:46.900
I have heard it over and it is nothing.

01:04:46.902 --> 01:04:47.777
Who are the actors?

01:04:47.779 --> 01:04:49.076
Some poor fisherman from the village

01:04:49.078 --> 01:04:51.550
and none of them have
any acting experience.

01:04:51.552 --> 01:04:53.228
I know they've worn out
their out-of-shape brains

01:04:53.230 --> 01:04:55.230
to put on this play for your wedding.

01:04:55.232 --> 01:04:56.652
I shall hear that play.

01:05:08.201 --> 01:05:12.034
Hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:05:27.275 --> 01:05:29.725
Ladies and gentlemen, our play is called

01:05:29.727 --> 01:05:34.724
The Untold Love Story of King
Jaja and the Young Becca.

01:05:34.726 --> 01:05:36.515
It is something I made up in my head

01:05:36.517 --> 01:05:39.615
based on a story that
my grandmother told me

01:05:39.617 --> 01:05:41.964
when I was growing up.

01:05:41.966 --> 01:05:44.915
To tell you the truth,
it could be my uncle

01:05:44.917 --> 01:05:46.065
now that I think of it.

01:05:46.067 --> 01:05:47.858
This speech is like a tangled chain.

01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:49.933
This man in the steel suit portrays

01:05:49.935 --> 01:05:52.338
a horrible piece of galvanize

01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:55.146
that comes between the lovers.

01:05:55.148 --> 01:05:59.148
The lovers are happy to
whisper through a crack.

01:06:00.850 --> 01:06:02.517
My name is Sinker.

01:06:04.016 --> 01:06:05.599
King Jaja and Becca

01:06:08.398 --> 01:06:11.481
speak sweet nothings through my hole.

01:06:14.599 --> 01:06:16.189
- Crack.
- Crack.

01:06:16.191 --> 01:06:20.421
It's the smartest
partition I ever heard speak.

01:06:20.423 --> 01:06:22.423
Oh, grim looked night.

01:06:23.276 --> 01:06:26.098
Oh night with hue so black.

01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:29.350
Oh night oh night, alack, alack, alack.

01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:33.950
I fear my Becca's promise is forgot.

01:06:36.075 --> 01:06:39.125
Thanks courteous galvanize.

01:06:39.127 --> 01:06:40.117
What is this?

01:06:40.119 --> 01:06:41.233
What's the eye?

01:06:41.235 --> 01:06:43.138
No Becca I see.

01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:46.390
Cursed thy steel for thus deceiving me.

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:51.089
The galvanize methinks being
sensible should curse again.

01:06:51.091 --> 01:06:54.313
No, in truth, sir, he should not.

01:06:54.315 --> 01:06:56.741
Deceiving me is Becca's cue.

01:06:56.743 --> 01:07:01.114
She is to enter now and I am
to spy through the galvanize.

01:07:01.116 --> 01:07:02.390
You shall see.

01:07:02.392 --> 01:07:03.933
It will fall pat as I told you.

01:07:06.184 --> 01:07:07.684
Thus deceiving me.

01:07:09.009 --> 01:07:09.842
Hook.

01:07:16.377 --> 01:07:21.207
Galvanize, you know I've
been waiting on my beloved Jaja

01:07:21.209 --> 01:07:24.233
and you couldn't tell me he was here?

01:07:24.235 --> 01:07:25.568
I see a voice.

01:07:26.785 --> 01:07:29.202
I will now to the hole to spy

01:07:30.968 --> 01:07:33.807
and I can hear my Becca's face.

01:07:33.809 --> 01:07:34.730
Becca?

01:07:34.732 --> 01:07:37.502
Jaja, baby, is that you, my love?

01:07:37.504 --> 01:07:38.421
Oh, look.

01:07:41.375 --> 01:07:45.875
Kiss me through this hole,
this hole of the galvanize.

01:07:52.487 --> 01:07:57.385
Wilt thou to the constipation
statue meet me straightaway?

01:07:57.387 --> 01:07:59.460
Emancipation statue, emancipation.

01:07:59.462 --> 01:08:04.462
Wilt thou to the emancipation
statue meet me straightaway?

01:08:05.412 --> 01:08:06.985
I will have to catch two zedars

01:08:06.987 --> 01:08:10.286
and walk across Bridgetown
but I will come.

01:08:15.182 --> 01:08:17.609
This is the silliest
stuff I've ever heard.

01:08:17.612 --> 01:08:19.060
The best in this kind are but shadows

01:08:19.063 --> 01:08:22.062
and the worst are no worse
if imagination mends it.

01:08:22.064 --> 01:08:26.261
The moonlight that King
Jaja and Becca meet under.

01:08:26.263 --> 01:08:31.095
And the evil steel donkey that
foils their romantic plans.

01:08:33.413 --> 01:08:34.965
I am wary of this moon.

01:08:34.966 --> 01:08:36.716
What he would change?

01:08:38.215 --> 01:08:43.014
The moonshine will now play
the Bussa Emancipation Statue.

01:08:43.015 --> 01:08:44.683
Well done, statue.

01:08:47.779 --> 01:08:50.336
Under which the lovers meet.

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:56.130
Silence, here comes Becca.

01:08:57.439 --> 01:08:59.326
Is this the constipation statue?

01:08:59.328 --> 01:09:00.420
Emancipation!

01:09:02.381 --> 01:09:04.381
Where is my King Jaja?

01:09:07.054 --> 01:09:09.551
Where is my King Jaja?

01:09:09.553 --> 01:09:10.800
Sinker.

01:09:10.801 --> 01:09:11.635
Neigh.

01:09:12.502 --> 01:09:13.335
Neigh!

01:09:14.334 --> 01:09:16.082
Well roared steel donkey.

01:09:16.085 --> 01:09:17.339
Well run Becca.

01:09:17.341 --> 01:09:21.029
As Becca ran away from the steel donkey,

01:09:21.032 --> 01:09:24.957
she dropped her scarf which
was stained with the blood

01:09:24.959 --> 01:09:27.881
from the steel donkey's mouth.

01:09:27.883 --> 01:09:28.716
Bottom.

01:09:33.935 --> 01:09:35.685
But stay, oh spite.

01:09:37.109 --> 01:09:39.131
But mark poor knight.

01:09:39.134 --> 01:09:41.384
What dreadful dole is here.

01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:43.760
Eyes, can you see?

01:09:45.033 --> 01:09:46.607
How can it be?

01:09:46.609 --> 01:09:48.609
Oh dainty duck, oh dear.

01:09:49.801 --> 01:09:51.301
O fates come come,

01:09:53.564 --> 01:09:56.113
cut thread and thrum.

01:09:56.115 --> 01:09:58.948
Quail, conclude, crush, and quell.

01:10:00.481 --> 01:10:01.961
This passion and the
death of a dear friend

01:10:01.963 --> 01:10:05.046
would go near to make a man look sad.

01:10:06.587 --> 01:10:08.587
My soul is in the sky.

01:10:09.512 --> 01:10:11.345
Tongue lose thy light.

01:10:12.913 --> 01:10:13.746
Moon,

01:10:17.887 --> 01:10:20.010
take thy flight.

01:10:20.012 --> 01:10:21.095
For now, die.

01:10:21.988 --> 01:10:23.571
Die, die, die, die.

01:10:27.919 --> 01:10:28.752
Die.

01:10:37.122 --> 01:10:38.455
Hey, hey, hey!

01:10:42.345 --> 01:10:43.762
Asleep my love?

01:10:45.971 --> 01:10:47.471
What dead my dove?

01:10:48.996 --> 01:10:50.746
Oh Jaja arise, speak.

01:10:53.121 --> 01:10:54.317
Quite dumb?

01:10:54.319 --> 01:10:55.152
Dead?

01:10:56.096 --> 01:10:56.929
Dead?

01:10:58.021 --> 01:11:00.242
A tomb must cover thy eyes.

01:11:00.244 --> 01:11:03.077
Oh sisters three come, come to me.

01:11:05.221 --> 01:11:06.721
Come trusty sword.

01:11:21.095 --> 01:11:25.012
Fine tragedy, very notably discharged.

01:11:41.822 --> 01:11:42.655
We won!

01:11:43.715 --> 01:11:46.174

01:12:13.131 --> 01:12:16.680
The iron tongue of
midnight hath told 12.

01:12:16.682 --> 01:12:19.849
Lovers to bed, 'tis almost fairy time.

01:13:14.623 --> 01:13:17.372
This palpable gross
play hath well beguiled

01:13:17.374 --> 01:13:20.146
the heavy gait of night.

01:13:20.148 --> 01:13:21.981
Sweet friends, to bed.

01:13:29.024 --> 01:13:33.691
Now the hungry lion roars and
the wolf behowls the moon.

01:13:37.450 --> 01:13:42.000
And we fairies that do run
from the presence of the sun

01:13:42.002 --> 01:13:43.252
now are frolic.

01:14:11.696 --> 01:14:15.050
Through the house give glimmering light.

01:14:15.052 --> 01:14:17.725
By the dead and drowsy fire,

01:14:17.727 --> 01:14:22.644
every elf and fairy sprite hop
as light as bird from brier.

01:14:23.697 --> 01:14:26.573
Hand in hand with fairy grace

01:14:26.575 --> 01:14:29.408
will we sing and bless this place.

01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:47.228
Now until the break of day,

01:14:47.230 --> 01:14:50.602
through this house each fairy stray.

01:14:50.604 --> 01:14:55.604
To the best bride bed will we,
which by us shall blessed be.

01:14:57.366 --> 01:15:01.616
And the issue there create
ever shall be fortunate.

01:15:02.868 --> 01:15:07.368
So shall all the couples
three ever true in loving be.

01:15:08.418 --> 01:15:10.918
And the blots of nature's hand

01:15:12.291 --> 01:15:14.874
shall not in their issue stand.

01:15:36.941 --> 01:15:39.285
If we shadows have offended,

01:15:39.287 --> 01:15:42.682
think but this and all is mended.

01:15:42.684 --> 01:15:44.257
That you have but slumbered here

01:15:44.259 --> 01:15:46.842
while these visions did appear.

01:15:48.034 --> 01:15:50.451
And this weak and idle theme,

01:15:53.070 --> 01:15:55.487
no more yielding but a dream.

01:16:33.845 --> 01:16:37.019

weak and idle theme,

01:16:37.021 --> 01:16:39.438
