00:45.078 --> 00:46.046
Tetsuo!

00:46.579 --> 00:47.847
Mom, I'm keeping an eye on him.

00:47.914 --> 00:49.516
If you looked after him
properly,

00:49.582 --> 00:51.184
I wouldn't have to worry.

00:51.584 --> 00:52.552
I'm sorry, mom.

00:53.453 --> 00:54.454
I'll take good care of him.

00:54.921 --> 00:55.889
You can be relaxed.

00:56.189 --> 00:58.458
What would your sister say
if she saw you right now?

00:59.592 --> 01:01.795
Mom, don't do that
when he's present.

01:06.633 --> 01:07.834
It's okay, honey.

01:29.889 --> 01:30.857
Tetsuo!

01:31.658 --> 01:33.760
-Tetsuo! Tetsuo!
-Tetsuo!

01:34.227 --> 01:35.762
Tetsuo!

01:36.596 --> 01:37.564
Tetsuo!

01:39.132 --> 01:40.100
Tetsuo!

01:42.035 --> 01:43.002
Tetsuo!

02:20.440 --> 02:21.574
EPISODE:
TETSUO

02:48.768 --> 02:51.437
-What's going on, Marcone?
-Not here. You compromise me.

02:51.504 --> 02:54.140
Stop beating around the bush!
I gave it to you a long ago!

02:54.207 --> 02:55.542
It's not that east, Raul.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.511
The specialist I work with
analyzed the bones.

02:58.578 --> 03:00.280
He said they are very rotten.

03:00.346 --> 03:01.548
He needs more time.

03:01.614 --> 03:03.049
How can I make him go faster?

03:03.983 --> 03:05.318
I need to do it calmly.

03:08.988 --> 03:10.757
Do you have any idea
how many DNA tests

03:10.823 --> 03:12.792
are done with this tiny machine?

03:13.293 --> 03:15.228
Of course you know.
You used to be the boss here.

03:15.295 --> 03:18.231
You also know I wouldn't be able
to do that right now.

03:19.599 --> 03:22.969
I know, but what can I do?
I need that DNA test done.

03:23.636 --> 03:24.871
Help me, Marcone!

03:24.938 --> 03:26.272
If you talked to Damasceno...

03:26.339 --> 03:28.241
Talk to him? He's very strict.

03:28.308 --> 03:29.642
He will want to fill out
the paperwork.

03:29.709 --> 03:30.677
Everything organized.

03:31.945 --> 03:34.514
And he won't be able to explain
where those bones came from.

03:34.847 --> 03:37.750
If we do it now, we skip a step
and don't compromise him.

03:38.318 --> 03:39.752
These are children's bones,
Marcone.

03:39.819 --> 03:41.487
But you compromise me!

03:42.755 --> 03:43.890
I'll do what I can, okay?

03:47.193 --> 03:48.161
Thank you.

04:11.851 --> 04:12.819
Your father?

04:19.926 --> 04:21.294
He's in the hospital again.

04:24.731 --> 04:25.965
I don't know what else to do.

04:30.169 --> 04:32.972
You don't have to say anything.
You've helped me a lot already.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.084
Raul?

04:46.052 --> 04:47.020
Raul Fagnani?

04:49.255 --> 04:50.490
I'm sorry. Who are you?

04:52.158 --> 04:53.126
Edith Nonato.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.895
I talked to you over the phone.

04:56.329 --> 04:57.664
Yes, your father?

04:57.730 --> 04:58.865
He's disappeared.

04:58.931 --> 05:01.234
I'm very worried.
He's got Alzheimer's disease.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.536
He's never alone, but...

05:04.370 --> 05:05.405
It was a slip-up.

05:07.006 --> 05:09.575
He went out on his own
and didn't come back.

05:09.642 --> 05:12.178
I don't know what to do.
He left and didn't come back.

05:12.245 --> 05:14.013
Calm. Just breathe, okay?

05:14.747 --> 05:15.815
Help me, Raul.

05:15.882 --> 05:17.784
I was told you could help me,
you're a policeman.

05:17.850 --> 05:19.152
I used to be.

05:20.520 --> 05:21.988
Would you like
some coffee, water?

05:22.855 --> 05:23.823
Yes, a coffee.

05:25.291 --> 05:26.259
Listen.

05:26.859 --> 05:29.028
Thank you very much, Mr. Raul!

05:32.131 --> 05:33.733
Call me Raul.

05:33.800 --> 05:34.767
Okay.

05:35.501 --> 05:37.136
I'm sorry for asking.

05:37.203 --> 05:40.239
Why did we meet here
and not in your office?

05:40.807 --> 05:44.544
First of all, I thought
we'd be more comfortable here.

05:45.211 --> 05:47.780
You'd be calmer
to talk about your father.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.216
And then?

05:50.817 --> 05:53.820
And then,
I haven't had breakfast yet.

05:55.355 --> 05:58.391
I trust you, sir. I mean, Raul.

05:58.925 --> 06:00.893
-Raul.
-My office is near here.

06:00.960 --> 06:03.162
-I'll start working now.
-Okay, thank you.

06:03.229 --> 06:04.664
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.

06:05.298 --> 06:06.265
Bye.

06:47.707 --> 06:48.808
You'd better come in.

06:49.709 --> 06:51.944
There's a client
waiting for you.

06:52.011 --> 06:54.080
I've got a team
trained for that.

06:54.147 --> 06:56.649
For a scandal? I don't think so!

06:57.083 --> 06:58.050
Scandal?

06:59.452 --> 07:00.420
Edith?

07:08.227 --> 07:09.529
It's your fault!

07:09.595 --> 07:12.331
Stop, mom! You were there too,
and I'm not blaming you!

07:12.398 --> 07:15.334
If he had been holding my hand,
this wouldn't have happened.

07:15.401 --> 07:16.436
What happened?

07:16.502 --> 07:18.004
Finally! I've been wasting
my time

07:18.070 --> 07:19.272
with your employees.

07:19.338 --> 07:21.707
You're wrong.
They are not my employees.

07:21.774 --> 07:22.842
They are my partners.

07:24.177 --> 07:25.278
What's your name?

07:25.344 --> 07:27.346
Keiko Fukugawa.

07:27.413 --> 07:29.348
My grandson, Tetsuo, disappeared
from Júlio Prestes Station.

07:29.916 --> 07:31.284
It was her fault! She useless!

07:31.350 --> 07:32.552
Stop it, mom!

07:33.619 --> 07:35.822
Are you sure he disappeared?

07:35.888 --> 07:37.757
Did you talk to the staff,
did you ask them?

07:37.824 --> 07:40.693
I begged them to close
the exits.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.728
They told me
that was impossible.

07:43.429 --> 07:44.397
Are you his mother?

07:45.031 --> 07:47.767
His aunt. Yoko died from cancer
two years ago.

07:47.834 --> 07:51.037
Poor Yoko. Tragedies
keep happening to this family.

07:51.103 --> 07:53.873
First Yoko, then Takashi
and now Tetsuo.

07:54.607 --> 07:57.610
You need to find my grandson!

07:57.677 --> 08:01.514
He has no parents.
I'm his only family!

08:01.581 --> 08:02.648
What about me, mom?

08:05.585 --> 08:08.087
Did you talk to the police
at the station?

08:08.154 --> 08:09.322
Yes, they told us...

08:09.388 --> 08:12.124
Brazil's police?
They act only if you pay them.

08:12.191 --> 08:13.493
That's why I came here.

08:13.559 --> 08:15.928
Mom, we don't know
if he was kidnapped.

08:15.995 --> 08:18.097
Maybe he's lost
and he'll show up eventually.

08:18.431 --> 08:21.767
Maria Júlia, get a cup of tea
for Mr. Keiko, please.

08:21.834 --> 08:23.236
Of course.
Come with me, Mr. Keiko.

08:23.302 --> 08:25.271
Let's get you some tea
so that you can relax.

08:25.338 --> 08:26.506
Come with me.

08:27.907 --> 08:28.875
Follow me.

08:29.642 --> 08:30.610
Come.

08:42.421 --> 08:43.389
Tell me.

08:45.925 --> 08:46.893
What?

08:49.729 --> 08:53.366
Your nephews disappeared,
and you think he's just lost?

08:54.567 --> 08:56.969
You didn't want to go
to the police,

08:57.036 --> 08:59.372
but I feel you're not
comfortable here either.

09:00.239 --> 09:01.274
Tell me the truth.

09:01.841 --> 09:03.976
I don't think his disappearance
was an accident.

09:06.178 --> 09:07.880
Involving more people
can be dangerous.

09:09.248 --> 09:10.616
Elaborate on that.

09:11.450 --> 09:13.819
Takashi, Tetsuo's father,

09:15.054 --> 09:17.290
died two weeks ago
in a car accident.

09:18.524 --> 09:20.660
It was raining,
his car skidded and...

09:21.727 --> 09:23.162
He fell from a cliff.

09:23.229 --> 09:26.032
And you think
that wasn't an accident.

09:27.199 --> 09:28.734
He was a great driver.

09:30.336 --> 09:32.905
He used to work as a driver
for some dangerous people.

09:35.274 --> 09:37.643
They smuggle electronic devices
in Santa Ifigênia, you know?

09:39.178 --> 09:40.146
Yes, but...

09:40.846 --> 09:44.050
Smuggled and fake junk

09:44.116 --> 09:45.384
doesn't kill anyone.

09:45.451 --> 09:47.853
He found out
they were using him as a mule

09:47.920 --> 09:49.455
to smuggle other things.

09:50.656 --> 09:51.958
He asked them to fire him.

09:52.858 --> 09:53.926
They said no.

09:53.993 --> 09:56.829
Is that why you think
they kidnapped Tetsuo?

09:56.896 --> 09:59.565
So that we stop meddling in,
investigating.

10:02.602 --> 10:03.569
It's a warning.

10:06.505 --> 10:08.874
That's why I want to go home
and wait for that call.

10:14.347 --> 10:16.315
-I see.
-Tetsuo is like a son to me.

10:22.388 --> 10:24.423
Júlio Prestes Station.

10:24.490 --> 10:26.692
Waldir went to check
the security cameras.

10:33.399 --> 10:34.367
Tetsuo.

10:38.971 --> 10:40.906
Tai, the usual.

10:40.973 --> 10:43.075
Morgue, hospitals, police.

10:43.142 --> 10:47.146
Maria Júlia, did Mr. Keiko
say anything else?

10:47.580 --> 10:49.181
Tetsuo is a healthy child.

10:49.615 --> 10:50.816
He's quiet

10:50.883 --> 10:53.119
because he lost his mother
and then his father.

10:53.786 --> 10:57.356
I sense in that family
there's lack of communication.

10:57.823 --> 11:00.393
But that kid
didn't leave on his own.

11:00.459 --> 11:02.895
According to her, he's obedient.

11:02.962 --> 11:04.497
So, I don't know.

11:05.398 --> 11:10.269
You told me that Ayumi told you
the kid's father was killed.

11:10.336 --> 11:11.303
Is that true?

11:12.538 --> 11:14.340
I'll check that right now.
Did you find something out, Tai?

11:14.407 --> 11:16.375
Takashi worked
at a dummy company,

11:16.442 --> 11:17.510
as I imagined.

11:17.576 --> 11:20.279
It's related to other companies,
front companies.

11:20.346 --> 11:23.082
I'm afraid it's impossible
to find out who the owner is.

11:23.149 --> 11:24.250
Tai?

11:24.784 --> 11:26.952
Nothing is impossible.
I'll handle that

11:27.019 --> 11:29.822
while you play
with your computer.

11:29.889 --> 11:30.856
Bye.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.693
-What's going on with him?
-He's been like that.

11:34.960 --> 11:35.928
It's difficult!

11:54.780 --> 11:57.717
NO SHOUTING OR WHISTLING
THANK YOU

12:02.922 --> 12:04.457
We will have to sing too?

12:05.391 --> 12:07.126
Ling is very demanding.

12:07.193 --> 12:09.395
If you need something from him,

12:09.462 --> 12:10.830
you have to sing first.

12:10.896 --> 12:13.966
Depending on how you do it,
he will help you or not.

12:14.300 --> 12:15.267
Are you serious?

12:18.804 --> 12:19.939
You almost got me!

12:20.573 --> 12:23.275
-I liked it.
-If you want to, you can sing.

12:24.143 --> 12:25.644
-No, I'm fine.
-Go.

12:26.712 --> 12:28.147
-Raul.
-Hello.

12:29.615 --> 12:32.551
I couldn't believe it
when they told me you were here.

12:32.618 --> 12:34.086
In very good company.

12:35.121 --> 12:36.088
What a success, Ling.

12:36.889 --> 12:39.925
It's hard to believe
you started off at a sake stand.

12:39.992 --> 12:42.628
Yes, and I'd still be there
if it hadn't been for you.

12:43.462 --> 12:44.430
That's not true.

12:44.930 --> 12:45.898
Listen.

12:46.766 --> 12:49.068
Raul, forget it.
Tell me, what do you need?

12:49.135 --> 12:52.505
A client of mine is involved
in an import company.

12:53.672 --> 12:56.909
-Ho Shei Eletrônicos.
-I know it.

12:56.976 --> 12:58.911
They provide all the shops
at the neighborhood.

12:59.411 --> 13:00.880
It has several names, you know.

13:00.946 --> 13:02.081
I see.

13:02.148 --> 13:04.517
I need to talk to the owner.

13:04.984 --> 13:06.685
-Do you know who he is?
-You never know

13:06.752 --> 13:07.753
with those people.

13:09.655 --> 13:10.689
Be careful.

13:11.457 --> 13:12.525
I'm always careful.

13:12.591 --> 13:13.626
-You're not.
-You're not.

13:15.361 --> 13:16.595
Give me a name, please.

13:20.399 --> 13:21.367
Here.

13:22.434 --> 13:23.402
Take this sheet of paper.

13:24.570 --> 13:25.538
Be very careful.

13:26.172 --> 13:28.474
I hope I see you singing
here someday.

13:29.909 --> 13:31.377
-I don't think so.
-With you, of course.

13:31.443 --> 13:32.711
Making a duet.

13:34.680 --> 13:36.749
I think it's time to change
the music, Ling.

13:37.416 --> 13:39.385
Thanks again, man.

13:40.452 --> 13:41.387
Bye.

13:59.071 --> 14:00.039
It's here.

14:05.044 --> 14:06.078
Hello.

14:06.378 --> 14:07.613
Yes, can I help you?

14:08.047 --> 14:10.816
We're looking for a man.

14:10.883 --> 14:11.851
Wu?

14:12.618 --> 14:14.420
Vu? I don't know how to say it.

14:14.486 --> 14:16.288
-Who.
-USB cable?

14:16.355 --> 14:17.423
-No.
-No

14:17.489 --> 14:18.891
We want to talk to Mr. Wu.

14:18.958 --> 14:20.693
-Yes.
-With him.

14:30.169 --> 14:31.136
Naomi!

14:31.570 --> 14:32.671
Come here.

14:34.473 --> 14:35.441
Take them there.

14:36.976 --> 14:37.943
Thank you.

14:38.577 --> 14:39.545
Thank you.

14:40.112 --> 14:41.080
Thank you.

14:46.852 --> 14:48.187
So, from now on,

14:49.355 --> 14:50.956
my daughter
is part of this company.

14:51.357 --> 14:53.459
I want to say I'm really happy

14:53.525 --> 14:55.594
to be here working with you.

14:55.661 --> 14:57.663
If anyone doesn't approve of it,

14:58.197 --> 14:59.265
they are fired

15:00.666 --> 15:01.967
I don't know
why you're laughing.

15:02.034 --> 15:03.402
I'm telling the truth.

15:08.340 --> 15:09.408
Melina, my dear daughter,

15:10.242 --> 15:12.411
I'm really happy to have you
here with me.

15:13.045 --> 15:14.013
I am too.

15:14.580 --> 15:15.547
Thank you, dad.

15:25.591 --> 15:26.659
Mr. Wu.

15:26.725 --> 15:27.693
Call me Wu, dear.

15:28.294 --> 15:29.495
How can I help you?

15:30.262 --> 15:31.230
Well...

15:34.066 --> 15:37.236
We're working for the family
of one of your employees.

15:38.003 --> 15:39.138
Takashi Kaneda.

15:39.705 --> 15:41.440
Why do you think
he's my employee?

15:41.507 --> 15:43.842
He works at your company.

15:43.909 --> 15:45.611
-Are you going to deny it?
-No.

15:45.678 --> 15:46.679
Of course not.

15:47.179 --> 15:50.082
But that kind of connection
is not that obvious.

15:50.683 --> 15:52.384
Do you work
for the insurance company?

15:52.851 --> 15:55.087
According to the police,
the case was closed.

15:55.154 --> 15:58.490
We do, indirectly,
but that's not why we came.

16:00.392 --> 16:03.529
Takashi was
an excellent employee.

16:04.096 --> 16:05.664
I trusted him blindly.

16:06.765 --> 16:09.401
That accident was a tragedy.

16:09.468 --> 16:12.004
Do you know
if he trusted you blindly too?

16:13.472 --> 16:16.141
We were told
that, before he died,

16:17.009 --> 16:19.578
he insinuated he was carrying
another type of cargo.

16:19.645 --> 16:20.913
What are you talking about?

16:20.980 --> 16:23.615
We're talking
about more dangerous cargo,

16:24.249 --> 16:25.217
more profitable cargo.

16:26.919 --> 16:28.420
There are many types of cargo.

16:28.854 --> 16:30.923
Some of them are more profitable
than others.

16:31.590 --> 16:34.226
I particularly prefer
the less profitable ones.

16:34.293 --> 16:35.561
It's calmer.

16:36.595 --> 16:38.664
You know? In this business,

16:38.731 --> 16:41.133
it's important
that we understand

16:41.900 --> 16:44.737
the risk we're willing to take.

16:44.803 --> 16:45.838
Right?

16:49.274 --> 16:50.843
What are you doing there?

16:52.277 --> 16:53.245
I'm thinking.

16:54.480 --> 16:55.914
It looks complicated!

16:57.116 --> 16:58.083
I don't know

16:58.484 --> 17:01.653
if it's better for them
to get off at other station

17:02.121 --> 17:03.355
or at this station.

17:04.490 --> 17:05.924
And what's your conclusion?

17:06.825 --> 17:09.495
I need to see the images.
Did you make it?

17:09.561 --> 17:11.330
The police department
has contacted us.

17:11.397 --> 17:12.364
And?

17:12.998 --> 17:14.233
The supervisor
has authorized us.

17:16.001 --> 17:16.969
Good!

17:17.736 --> 17:18.704
Come on, man.

17:20.172 --> 17:22.040
This is all I needed!

17:22.107 --> 17:24.410
Spend the day with you.

17:27.079 --> 17:28.514
Today is your lucky day.

17:29.848 --> 17:31.817
This changes color.

17:32.484 --> 17:33.552
Okay.

17:33.619 --> 17:35.687
It adds up to what I imagined.

17:36.255 --> 17:38.323
Any news about the accident?

17:38.390 --> 17:39.358
So pretty!

17:39.925 --> 17:41.026
Okay.

17:41.093 --> 17:42.761
Perfect. Thank you.

17:43.095 --> 17:44.063
Bye.

17:47.266 --> 17:49.234
Look at this.
For Tai's daughter.

17:49.301 --> 17:50.536
She has one already. Let's go.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.271
To a less noisy place.

17:53.338 --> 17:54.306
Shall we?

17:55.040 --> 17:56.375
I'll take it. 20, right?

18:00.079 --> 18:01.713
It's good,
but I prefer empanadas.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.784
And you tried to pass yourself
off as a Brazilian.

18:07.486 --> 18:08.454
I am Brazilian!

18:09.121 --> 18:11.824
Okay, but you're definitely not
from São Paulo.

18:21.900 --> 18:23.669
Tai sent me photos
of the accident.

18:24.403 --> 18:25.604
Look how interesting.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.340
Don't you think
there's something missing?

18:29.241 --> 18:30.209
What do you mean?

18:31.143 --> 18:32.111
There's no body.

18:32.744 --> 18:34.980
To my understanding,

18:35.047 --> 18:37.282
he was ejected from the car
and the river swept him away.

18:37.349 --> 18:40.152
He was a driver.
He was used to that road.

18:41.386 --> 18:42.421
I don't get it, Raul.

18:42.488 --> 18:44.022
Why are we looking
into the father

18:44.089 --> 18:45.090
instead of the kid?

18:46.725 --> 18:49.194
I think one thing
is related to the other one.

18:51.330 --> 18:54.299
When we find one of them,
we will find the other one.

18:56.368 --> 18:57.336
I don't know.

18:59.338 --> 19:00.806
Let's go!

19:03.242 --> 19:04.510
You owe me.

19:04.576 --> 19:05.911
What are you saying, Onofre?

19:06.812 --> 19:08.213
I owe you?

19:08.780 --> 19:09.948
Come on!

19:10.916 --> 19:11.950
What are you doing?

19:12.651 --> 19:14.486
It happened between
six and seven in the morning.

19:14.953 --> 19:15.888
Go back.

19:17.656 --> 19:19.458
He disappeared on the platform.

19:21.927 --> 19:23.228
Zoom in.

19:29.501 --> 19:30.869
Here! Go back!

19:30.936 --> 19:32.437
-Calm.
-Go back, damn it!

19:32.971 --> 19:34.973
There. Pause it.

19:36.275 --> 19:37.976
There! What the hell!

19:38.043 --> 19:39.745
It's him. Play it slowly now.

19:41.747 --> 19:43.382
Go back. Go back to that image.

19:44.249 --> 19:45.384
There. Pause it.

19:46.652 --> 19:48.420
We need to follow
that green bag.

19:48.820 --> 19:50.289
Now we need to focus
on that bag.

19:50.756 --> 19:51.990
-Green bag.
-Okay.

19:52.057 --> 19:54.026
Check the exit cameras
to see if they went out.

19:54.660 --> 19:56.061
I don't think
they used this exit.

19:59.298 --> 20:01.200
So mischievous.

20:07.706 --> 20:08.974
-Hi, Waldir.
-We found him.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.143
But we can't see the face
of the adult that's with him.

20:11.510 --> 20:13.212
But they took a train...

20:13.912 --> 20:14.980
Where?

20:15.047 --> 20:16.081
Coral line, to the east.

20:16.548 --> 20:19.451
Coral line, to the east.

20:19.518 --> 20:22.487
Do you know
you sometimes surprise me?

20:22.554 --> 20:23.622
Well done.

20:23.689 --> 20:26.291
At Brás Station,
it splits into three lines.

20:27.092 --> 20:30.929
We'll have to check the cameras
at all the stations.

20:31.363 --> 20:32.998
That's why I pay you well.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.933
The sooner you start,
the sooner you'll finish.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.401
-I know.
-Good luck.

20:39.905 --> 20:41.440
So, you pay Waldir well?

20:42.441 --> 20:44.643
Very well. And you too.

20:46.511 --> 20:47.546
I even pay for your snacks.

20:48.714 --> 20:49.781
Let's do this.

20:49.848 --> 20:51.316
-What?
-What do you mean?

20:52.484 --> 20:53.452
Are you serious?

20:55.387 --> 20:56.989
It will take us all night!

20:57.389 --> 20:59.091
Nights are quieter.

20:59.558 --> 21:01.560
The sooner you start,
the sooner you'll finish.

21:04.129 --> 21:06.331
At least we know
the kid is alive.

21:07.566 --> 21:08.533
Do we?

21:11.536 --> 21:13.605
What about you?
Do you have any children

21:13.672 --> 21:14.773
No, of course not.

21:15.240 --> 21:18.076
If I had a child, do you think
I would have run away

21:18.143 --> 21:19.344
and abandoned him?

21:20.012 --> 21:21.747
So, you ran away from Argentina?

21:23.682 --> 21:25.384
I had to, okay?

21:26.218 --> 21:27.986
I had no choice.
My dad had disappeared.

21:28.754 --> 21:29.821
I had to leave.

21:29.888 --> 21:32.658
Are you sure your father
is the victim in this story?

21:32.724 --> 21:34.026
What do you mean?

21:34.092 --> 21:35.627
Nothing is what it seems.

21:35.694 --> 21:37.562
I think you don't know
what you're talking about.

21:38.463 --> 21:41.166
You were run over already.
You're putting yourself at risk.

21:41.233 --> 21:43.468
Listen, Raul. I never
got involved in your life.

21:43.535 --> 21:44.936
Or your daughter's case.

21:45.804 --> 21:48.106
Have I ever told you to give up?

21:50.842 --> 21:52.177
I'm just saying,

21:53.045 --> 21:55.147
when you're deep
into a situation,

21:55.213 --> 21:56.548
you don't get to think clearly.

21:56.615 --> 21:59.651
I think you should mind
your own business.

22:02.387 --> 22:05.190
We'll talk about this later.

22:05.257 --> 22:06.458
I have to leave now.

22:11.029 --> 22:12.431
Did you ask for this?

22:12.497 --> 22:13.465
Give it to me, Dama.

22:14.132 --> 22:15.200
Imagine my surprise

22:15.267 --> 22:17.469
when they told me
the DNA test was ready,

22:17.536 --> 22:19.504
and I hadn't asked for it.

22:20.439 --> 22:22.474
I talked to Marcone.
He didn't know what to say.

22:22.841 --> 22:23.942
It's not his fault.

22:24.009 --> 22:25.077
Of course not.

22:25.143 --> 22:26.845
I didn't want to bother you.

22:27.145 --> 22:29.247
You don't bother me, Raul.

22:29.748 --> 22:32.617
Why did you use, illegally,
my department's resources?

22:34.586 --> 22:36.421
-Did you open it?
-Of course.

22:39.424 --> 22:41.426
Give it to me. I need to know.

22:42.561 --> 22:44.563
Are you ready
for the information inside?

23:18.330 --> 23:19.998
-It's not her.
-No, it's not.

23:20.065 --> 23:22.801
My team checked.
It's a girl two years older.

23:23.702 --> 23:25.070
But I have something for you.

23:26.605 --> 23:27.606
A new detail.

23:29.775 --> 23:30.742
What?

23:33.512 --> 23:34.546
Those bones

23:35.414 --> 23:36.848
are from an old investigation.

23:36.915 --> 23:38.350
I don't have access to the file.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.485
Gusmão was the chief back then.
Do you know him?

23:41.119 --> 23:42.053
Alberto Gusmão?

23:42.454 --> 23:45.724
Yes, he was the chief
when I started here.

23:45.791 --> 23:47.359
He retired soon after.

23:48.527 --> 23:50.028
But he taught me a lot.

23:51.930 --> 23:53.465
Do you have his number?

24:26.965 --> 24:27.933
It's cold.

24:30.869 --> 24:31.837
Tai?

24:32.471 --> 24:34.539
Look what I found.

24:35.106 --> 24:36.074
Who's that for?

24:36.942 --> 24:37.909
Evinha.

24:39.978 --> 24:43.315
We were at Liberdade. I saw it
and thought it was cute.

24:43.782 --> 24:44.749
It is!

24:45.083 --> 24:46.618
-She'll love it.
-You think so?

25:04.736 --> 25:05.770
Waldir.

25:06.538 --> 25:07.506
Waldir!

25:09.875 --> 25:10.842
Waldir!

25:11.543 --> 25:13.578
Calm! Calm!

25:13.645 --> 25:14.613
Breathe.

25:19.651 --> 25:21.253
That's a strange way
to wake me up, Onofre.

25:22.187 --> 25:23.154
Damn it!

25:24.022 --> 25:25.891
-I found it.
-What did you find?

25:26.458 --> 25:28.093
The green bag. Come here.

25:32.964 --> 25:34.065
Where is it?

25:37.869 --> 25:39.104
Green bag.

25:40.372 --> 25:42.107
I can't see. Zoom in.

25:56.655 --> 25:58.456
Answer, Raul.

25:58.924 --> 25:59.891
Raul!

26:00.191 --> 26:01.493
I found him!

26:01.560 --> 26:02.827
I found him!

26:02.894 --> 26:03.962
We found him.

26:04.029 --> 26:05.463
We can't see his face, but...

26:05.997 --> 26:07.933
There's a surprise.
I sent it to you.

26:09.100 --> 26:11.469
It's not what I expected,
but it helps a lot.

26:11.536 --> 26:14.205
Now we know
the man knew what he was doing.

26:14.272 --> 26:16.875
He was hiding his face
on purpose.

26:16.942 --> 26:18.410
Do we know where they got off?

26:18.710 --> 26:20.211
Which station?

26:20.278 --> 26:22.247
Ipiranga.

26:22.314 --> 26:23.281
Go there.

26:23.715 --> 26:26.985
Check the security cameras.
Ask if someone saw them.

26:27.052 --> 26:28.019
Okay.

26:30.589 --> 26:31.656
-Leave me alone!
-I love you.

26:31.723 --> 26:32.791
What happened?

26:32.857 --> 26:35.594
Do you like fried chicken
or you prefer empanadas?

26:35.660 --> 26:36.828
I prefer empanadas.

26:47.872 --> 26:48.840
Excuse me.

26:52.477 --> 26:55.513
We wanted to talk to Everton.

26:55.580 --> 26:57.716
He's not home. He's working.

26:57.782 --> 26:58.750
Can I help you?

26:59.084 --> 27:01.953
We went to Frango Feliz
to talk to Mr. Agenor.

27:02.420 --> 27:04.889
He said there are only
two deliveryman at the shop.

27:05.457 --> 27:06.524
-Yes. Pablo and him.
-Yes.

27:06.591 --> 27:08.293
We talked to Pablo as well.

27:09.027 --> 27:10.862
But we need to talk to Everton.

27:11.463 --> 27:12.931
It's about the jacket he lost.

27:12.998 --> 27:13.965
Again?

27:14.466 --> 27:16.101
It's just a second-hand jacket.

27:16.534 --> 27:17.502
And it's awful.

27:18.269 --> 27:20.071
We told Agenor
we're going to pay for it.

27:20.138 --> 27:22.607
We just wanted to know
where he lost it.

27:22.674 --> 27:24.576
He swears he didn't lose it.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.344
He hangs it from there
as soon as he arrives.

27:28.213 --> 27:30.815
He went to grab it one day,
but it wasn't there.

27:30.882 --> 27:32.550
It's strange it disappeared
in the house.

27:33.184 --> 27:34.919
I searched everywhere,
but I couldn't find it.

27:35.453 --> 27:37.555
He must have left it somewhere
and he doesn't remember.

27:39.691 --> 27:40.992
Do you by any chance
recognize him?

27:42.227 --> 27:44.529
Of course not.
He's wearing a hoodie.

27:44.596 --> 27:45.563
Who is him?

27:48.600 --> 27:49.634
This kid.

27:55.573 --> 27:56.541
How cute.

27:57.142 --> 27:58.109
But I never saw him.

28:00.845 --> 28:02.547
Suzana, do you think Everton

28:02.614 --> 28:04.816
could have left it
somewhere else?

28:05.750 --> 28:08.353
-Where?
-A women's house?

28:08.420 --> 28:09.621
I don't think so

28:09.688 --> 28:11.056
and I don't like
what you're suggesting.

28:11.122 --> 28:12.323
-I'm sorry, but...
-You should leave.

28:12.390 --> 28:14.192
We really need to find
that jacket.

28:14.259 --> 28:16.594
-She didn't mean that.
-You come here and ask me...

28:16.661 --> 28:18.029
Just leave.

28:18.096 --> 28:19.431
-Please.
-Thank you.

28:20.565 --> 28:21.533
We're leaving.

28:24.002 --> 28:25.704
I'm saying
you can't just go around

28:25.770 --> 28:27.439
making accusations
out of nowhere.

28:27.505 --> 28:28.606
Out of nowhere?

28:28.673 --> 28:31.509
You saw her face
when she saw Ayumi's photo.

28:31.576 --> 28:33.111
Because of Keiko, maybe.

28:33.178 --> 28:35.013
Why would she react like that
because of Keiko?

28:35.080 --> 28:37.515
Everyone reacts badly
when they see that woman.

28:37.582 --> 28:40.185
Suzana is hiding something,
Raul. I'm sure.

28:41.086 --> 28:44.389
Just because you're hiding
something, or many things,

28:44.456 --> 28:45.790
doesn't mean everyone else does.

28:45.857 --> 28:46.825
Listen.

28:47.592 --> 28:49.961
I'm just asking for you
to respect my silence.

28:50.929 --> 28:51.896
Is that too much to ask?

28:59.604 --> 29:00.572
Dad?

29:08.847 --> 29:10.648
I found out
something really strange.

29:12.016 --> 29:14.486
There are many guns
without serial number

29:14.552 --> 29:15.487
in the production line.

29:22.227 --> 29:24.262
You knew about this. You knew!

29:30.001 --> 29:31.269
-Honey!
-Don't!

29:33.171 --> 29:35.073
So, the accident coincides
with what we were told.

29:35.140 --> 29:37.876
There was a storm.
The curve was dangerous.

29:37.942 --> 29:40.211
The car was found
at the bottom of the cliff.

29:40.278 --> 29:42.080
Half of it was in the river.

29:42.647 --> 29:43.615
There was no body.

29:44.983 --> 29:45.950
Was there any cargo?

29:46.751 --> 29:48.419
No, at least not in the car.

29:49.387 --> 29:51.856
Do you know
if he had some kind of insurance

29:51.923 --> 29:53.358
or if he left something
for someone?

29:54.292 --> 29:56.861
For Tetsuo.
But it was a small amount.

29:56.928 --> 29:59.197
It wouldn't be worth
killing someone to get it.

29:59.764 --> 30:02.033
Besides, the insurance company
hasn't concluded the case

30:02.100 --> 30:05.303
because they consider
something is weird.

30:05.904 --> 30:09.073
They're not the only ones
who think that.

30:11.609 --> 30:12.577
What about you?

30:13.444 --> 30:14.712
You're very silent.

30:14.779 --> 30:18.383
What if Suzana, Everton's wife,
had an affair with Takashi?

30:18.449 --> 30:20.351
Keiko found out about it

30:20.418 --> 30:21.886
and ordered someone
to kill Takashi.

30:23.454 --> 30:24.589
Right.

30:24.656 --> 30:26.291
What about the jacket?

30:26.357 --> 30:27.926
It was stolen on purpose
to blame both of them

30:27.992 --> 30:29.561
for the kid's kidnapping.

30:30.528 --> 30:33.464
-It makes sense.
-I think you're too tired.

30:33.531 --> 30:35.667
You see conspiracy theories
everywhere.

30:35.733 --> 30:37.902
Okay, I'll go
and talk to Wu again.

30:37.969 --> 30:39.971
There's something else
about the accident.

30:40.638 --> 30:41.706
-Are you coming?
-No.

30:41.773 --> 30:43.942
I'll stay here
with my conspiracy theories.

30:44.342 --> 30:45.910
-Enjoy them.
-Thank you.

30:48.413 --> 30:49.380
Wow!

30:50.448 --> 30:52.050
There's some tension
between you two.

30:53.184 --> 30:54.752
Why do you talk to each other
like that?

30:54.819 --> 30:57.722
Raul is focused on the accident.

30:58.189 --> 31:00.458
And I think the jacket's clue
is much better.

31:00.892 --> 31:01.926
Why?

31:02.393 --> 31:03.361
I don't know.

31:04.162 --> 31:05.530
Feminine intuition.

31:06.731 --> 31:09.534
Suzana had swollen eyes
from crying, you know?

31:10.602 --> 31:12.303
Something happened.

31:12.904 --> 31:14.239
And I think
it has to do with the case.

31:14.305 --> 31:17.308
That's why you suggested
an affair with Takashi.

31:17.375 --> 31:18.343
Exactly.

31:18.877 --> 31:22.013
The way she reacted
when I showed her Ayumi's photo.

31:23.181 --> 31:24.949
First, I thought maybe

31:25.016 --> 31:27.018
Ayumi and Everton,
Suzana's husband,

31:27.085 --> 31:28.253
were having an affair.

31:28.319 --> 31:29.254
I'm sure they weren't.

31:29.687 --> 31:30.655
Why not?

31:31.256 --> 31:32.991
Ayumi doesn't like men.

31:33.057 --> 31:34.525
Really, Tai? How do you know?

31:36.094 --> 31:37.228
Lesbian intuition.

31:39.564 --> 31:40.732
So stuck-up!

31:50.742 --> 31:52.677
Hey, you, with the cap.
How are you?

31:52.744 --> 31:54.512
Do those security cameras work?

31:55.113 --> 31:57.615
Yes? Could I get access
to the images?

31:57.682 --> 31:59.183
We're looking for a gang

31:59.250 --> 32:02.487
that rob old people
when they get their pension.

32:02.553 --> 32:04.489
We are after them.
We almost got them.

32:04.555 --> 32:07.992
I'm sure that, if they were here
and I can access those images,

32:08.059 --> 32:09.227
we will finally get them.

32:20.371 --> 32:22.740
Suzana, I came here to apologize
for having suggested

32:22.807 --> 32:24.375
your husband
was having an affair.

32:25.743 --> 32:27.312
It isn't necessary. It's fine.

32:29.414 --> 32:30.381
But you are.

32:31.716 --> 32:32.684
With Ayumi.

32:33.251 --> 32:34.319
Are you mad?

32:34.385 --> 32:36.020
If you want to,
I can call your husband.

32:36.087 --> 32:37.622
No, don't do it.

32:41.459 --> 32:43.027
So, tell me, Suzana.

32:44.462 --> 32:45.797
I don't know what happened.

32:47.932 --> 32:49.267
I'm still trying to understand.

32:50.969 --> 32:52.637
She came a few days ago.

32:54.906 --> 32:56.274
She wanted to say goodbye.

32:57.275 --> 32:58.843
She said we wouldn't see
each other again.

33:02.814 --> 33:04.215
I asked her why,

33:04.949 --> 33:06.351
and she told me
I wouldn't understand.

33:06.818 --> 33:07.785
So,

33:08.152 --> 33:09.187
she kissed me and left.

33:11.956 --> 33:14.492
-What about the jacket?
-I don't know where it is.

33:14.559 --> 33:17.028
After she came,
the jacket disappeared.

33:17.962 --> 33:19.797
Why would she want
that ridiculous jacket?

33:21.766 --> 33:22.934
But she took it.

33:25.103 --> 33:27.171
And? Did you find the kid?

33:27.238 --> 33:29.707
I know you're very worried.

33:29.774 --> 33:30.742
Not yet.

33:31.442 --> 33:32.610
But...

33:32.677 --> 33:36.781
I came here to ask you
some questions about Takashi.

33:37.882 --> 33:40.318
You think both cases
are related, right?

33:40.785 --> 33:41.753
I see.

33:42.320 --> 33:43.788
I can assure you

33:44.489 --> 33:46.190
I have nothing to do

33:46.257 --> 33:48.559
with that man and that child
disappearance.

33:49.127 --> 33:51.062
Why would I believe you?

33:51.129 --> 33:54.132
Takashi was a great employee,
highly recommended.

33:55.066 --> 33:56.134
He was so good

33:56.200 --> 33:58.970
that he sometimes handled
big amounts of money.

34:00.171 --> 34:01.205
I see.

34:02.006 --> 34:03.241
When the car was found,

34:03.908 --> 34:06.677
neither the bag with money
nor Takashi were there.

34:07.345 --> 34:08.679
That's the problem, you see?

34:08.746 --> 34:12.450
Yes. In a normal accident,
you'd find both.

34:13.518 --> 34:17.455
Or the body would be missing,
but the bag with money wouldn't.

34:17.522 --> 34:20.491
Or the money would be missing,

34:20.558 --> 34:23.161
but the body would be found
in the car.

34:23.227 --> 34:24.362
Exactly.

34:25.863 --> 34:27.131
Do me a favor, Raul.

34:28.299 --> 34:30.735
If you find
my excellent employee,

34:31.536 --> 34:33.004
I'd like to talk to him.

34:39.277 --> 34:41.546
-Raul?
-I thought it was your day off.

34:41.612 --> 34:43.648
I got a very good image
with both of them.

34:43.714 --> 34:45.416
Guess who the kid was with?

34:45.483 --> 34:46.984
Takashi, his father.

34:47.051 --> 34:49.487
-How do you know?
-I'm a good detective.

34:49.554 --> 34:50.755
What do you think?

34:50.822 --> 34:54.125
Hey, I have an incoming call.
I'll call you back.

34:54.192 --> 34:55.159
Just a minute.

34:57.195 --> 34:59.764
-Hi.
-I know who stole the jacket.

34:59.831 --> 35:00.798
Ayumi.

35:01.232 --> 35:02.300
How do you know?

35:02.366 --> 35:03.434
Everybody has doubts

35:03.501 --> 35:05.203
about my talent
as an investigator?

35:06.404 --> 35:08.439
-What?
-Takashi faked his death.

35:09.006 --> 35:10.541
Ayumi and him ran away together.

35:10.608 --> 35:11.742
-They're having an affair.
-No.

35:11.809 --> 35:13.945
You're wrong, detective.

35:14.445 --> 35:15.980
At least you're wrong
about their affair.

35:16.948 --> 35:18.416
Tai sent me his address.

35:18.916 --> 35:20.685
Guess where he lives.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.053
Ipiranga?

35:22.920 --> 35:24.388
How the hell do you do it?

35:24.455 --> 35:26.624
Sent me the address.
I'll see you there.

35:41.105 --> 35:42.540
How come
they're not having an affair?

35:42.607 --> 35:43.908
How come Takashi is alive?

35:45.243 --> 35:47.812
I told you the kidnapping
was related to the accident.

35:47.879 --> 35:49.480
And I told you the jacket
was important.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.115
It's there.

35:57.488 --> 35:59.891
Ayumi, we need to talk.

35:59.957 --> 36:01.225
I'm sorry. I'm busy.

36:01.292 --> 36:03.261
Would you rather talk
to the police?

36:03.327 --> 36:04.562
You can call them.

36:05.429 --> 36:06.764
-Wait, Ayumi.
-Let's talk.

36:06.831 --> 36:07.798
Ayumi!

36:15.673 --> 36:16.641
Raul?

36:28.653 --> 36:29.954
That night on the road,

36:30.855 --> 36:33.257
I almost fell down the cliff
when the car skipped.

36:34.292 --> 36:35.526
One more second,

36:35.593 --> 36:37.195
and my life
would have changed completely.

36:37.261 --> 36:38.329
When you realized,

36:38.396 --> 36:40.264
you were carrying
a big sum of money, right?

36:40.331 --> 36:41.999
It was big enough
to start a new life.

36:43.334 --> 36:45.002
I was a unique opportunity.

36:45.570 --> 36:47.405
So, you talked to Ayumi,

36:47.972 --> 36:50.708
and you decided to run away
together, did you?

36:51.075 --> 36:52.910
When Takashi told me
he was alive,

36:52.977 --> 36:54.779
I saw it as an opportunity
to start over.

36:54.845 --> 36:56.280
Far away from Keiko?

36:58.783 --> 37:00.518
My mother is very controlling.

37:00.585 --> 37:02.286
She got worse
after my sister died.

37:03.754 --> 37:04.722
Tetsuo...

37:05.790 --> 37:07.258
He was always afraid
of his own grandma.

37:07.325 --> 37:10.061
And the jacket?
Why did you take it?

37:10.127 --> 37:11.796
It was an impulse.

37:11.862 --> 37:13.431
I saw it and thought,

37:13.497 --> 37:16.234
if Takashi wore a hoodie,
he wouldn't be recognized.

37:16.734 --> 37:19.570
I didn't think Suzana's husband
wore it to go to work.

37:20.905 --> 37:23.241
I was so nervous
with everything going on.

37:26.711 --> 37:28.679
I was saying goodbye
to the woman I love.

37:28.746 --> 37:32.216
So, you are not having
an affair?

37:32.283 --> 37:33.284
We're just friends.

37:34.151 --> 37:36.787
But Ayumi is like a mother
to Tetsuo.

37:37.421 --> 37:38.990
Where are you planning to go?

37:39.056 --> 37:40.524
We want to go to Japan.

37:40.591 --> 37:42.727
If we hadn't come here,

37:42.793 --> 37:45.696
you'd be on your way
to the airport already, right?

37:45.763 --> 37:46.731
Yes.

37:47.465 --> 37:48.432
Tetsuo!

37:51.969 --> 37:54.372
-Mom!
-Not a word, Ayumi.

37:54.438 --> 37:55.406
What are you doing?

37:56.774 --> 37:58.109
Keiko, what are you doing here?

37:58.175 --> 37:59.410
I had people following you.

38:01.045 --> 38:04.081
I didn't think
you were doing your job.

38:04.482 --> 38:06.817
But I was wrong.

38:07.485 --> 38:09.120
Here's your money.

38:09.186 --> 38:12.189
There's extra money
because you found my son-in-law.

38:12.957 --> 38:14.992
I should be happy
because he's alive,

38:15.059 --> 38:18.195
but I learnt that it's a crime
to fake your own death.

38:19.030 --> 38:21.632
Raul, you can't accept
that money.

38:22.066 --> 38:23.534
You can't let her
get away with this.

38:23.601 --> 38:25.202
-But she's right.
-What?

38:25.936 --> 38:26.904
She's right.

38:29.140 --> 38:31.175
She hired us
to find her grandson.

38:31.242 --> 38:32.209
And we found him.

38:32.943 --> 38:34.011
Right?

38:34.078 --> 38:36.781
And Takashi committed a crime.
He did.

38:37.782 --> 38:39.517
But if he goes to jail,

38:39.583 --> 38:42.053
he could try reduce his sentence

38:43.220 --> 38:46.891
turning in the real owners
of the company he worked for.

38:46.957 --> 38:48.025
What are you talking about?

38:48.092 --> 38:51.696
You hid the clues pretty well,
but not well enough.

38:52.296 --> 38:54.332
You got this job for Takashi.

38:54.398 --> 38:57.468
It's not hard to work out
Wu is a good manager,

38:57.535 --> 38:59.737
but there's clearly somebody
above him.

38:59.804 --> 39:00.771
You don't have proof.

39:01.439 --> 39:03.140
I have nothing to prove.

39:03.774 --> 39:06.277
Takashi is the one
that has to prove it

39:06.744 --> 39:08.045
when they put him in jail.

39:08.612 --> 39:10.247
Of course,
he's going to get help.

39:10.848 --> 39:12.450
You wouldn't imagine
how easy it is

39:12.516 --> 39:14.151
to get information
on the Internet

39:14.218 --> 39:16.354
when you work
for the right people.

39:16.887 --> 39:18.522
Are you threatening me?

39:19.023 --> 39:21.225
No, I wouldn't do that, Keiko.

39:22.760 --> 39:23.961
Here's my proposal.

39:25.896 --> 39:27.932
We were never here!

39:28.566 --> 39:29.533
You,

39:30.401 --> 39:31.435
me

39:31.502 --> 39:32.470
or Maria Júlia.

39:34.438 --> 39:36.006
We'll let them go.

39:40.177 --> 39:41.278
Tetsuo?

39:41.345 --> 39:42.446
He's my grandson!

39:42.947 --> 39:46.250
Would you like him to choose
who he wants to be with?

40:09.507 --> 40:12.777
You know? I thought for a second
you would turn both of them in.

40:18.649 --> 40:20.751
But after what you did,

40:20.818 --> 40:23.320
you have a new enemy
for the rest of your life.

40:24.722 --> 40:25.689
Another one?

40:30.528 --> 40:31.829
Shall we have a drink?

40:33.664 --> 40:35.666
Everyone is going out
for drinks.

40:35.733 --> 40:36.700
Don't you want to go?

40:38.068 --> 40:39.770
Don't you want
to drink one here?

40:45.576 --> 40:46.811
Maybe next time.

40:49.980 --> 40:50.948
Next time.

41:03.060 --> 41:05.996
If I had known you'd exaggerate,
I'd have never offered you some.

41:07.097 --> 41:08.065
It's over.

41:15.706 --> 41:19.109
Please, dad.
Don't you ever do that again.

41:19.176 --> 41:20.611
Never, dad!

41:23.013 --> 41:25.316
Go and sit there. Go.

41:25.850 --> 41:26.884
Be careful, dad.

41:36.494 --> 41:37.495
Listen.

41:38.462 --> 41:40.397
You know I don't have
much money to pay you.

41:40.998 --> 41:42.066
Don't worry.

41:42.132 --> 41:44.602
You can pay me with candies
from the store.

41:44.668 --> 41:46.704
You can take as many candies
as you want.

41:48.005 --> 41:50.374
I was thinking about paying you
in a different way.

41:54.545 --> 41:57.848
Everyone is asking why I have
this small candy shop.

42:00.284 --> 42:02.720
I inherited it from my dad,
who inherited it from his dad.

42:02.786 --> 42:05.256
It used to be a big business,
you know?

42:05.322 --> 42:07.157
Many employees.

42:07.858 --> 42:09.260
We sold candies
around the country.

42:10.494 --> 42:14.198
But today it's just me
and my candy shop.

42:15.966 --> 42:17.735
And there is
this big empty space.

42:19.904 --> 42:20.871
What do you think?

42:22.006 --> 42:23.140
I'm not following you.

42:25.075 --> 42:26.944
I know you work
in your car, Raul.

42:27.011 --> 42:29.046
You live in there too.
I saw you.

42:29.880 --> 42:30.848
Okay?

42:31.715 --> 42:33.817
It's not like that, Edith.

42:34.351 --> 42:37.154
My car is my moving base.

42:37.221 --> 42:38.956
I know what it is like
to be broke.

42:42.927 --> 42:43.894
I also know...

42:45.829 --> 42:48.666
how important it is
when someone gives us a hand

42:48.732 --> 42:50.167
and believes in you.

42:53.671 --> 42:54.638
Edith...

42:55.940 --> 42:57.107
-No.
-No!

42:57.174 --> 43:00.244
Don't say anything.
Besides, I don't use this space.

43:00.311 --> 43:01.345
So...

43:01.712 --> 43:04.582
And it would be great
to have company.

43:08.352 --> 43:09.286
This is...

43:10.654 --> 43:11.922
I don't know what to say.

43:12.356 --> 43:14.391
I could hire a whole team
to work with me here.

43:14.458 --> 43:16.961
There's a shower at the back.
You can also live here.

43:17.027 --> 43:18.829
But tell me something first.

43:19.330 --> 43:20.397
What?

43:20.464 --> 43:22.232
This agency of yours,

43:23.167 --> 43:24.168
does it have a name?

43:30.407 --> 43:32.242
Thank you. Thank you very much.

43:43.787 --> 43:45.723
-Alberto.
-Raul.

43:49.093 --> 43:50.294
Four grandchildren, right?

43:50.361 --> 43:52.162
Yes, four,

43:52.997 --> 43:55.065
but the fifth is on their way.

43:55.132 --> 43:56.166
That's great.

43:56.734 --> 43:59.336
Tell me, Alberto.
What do you have for me?

44:02.573 --> 44:05.743
Mirtes De Oliveira.
70 years old.

44:06.710 --> 44:08.178
Batatinha's ex-wife.

44:09.446 --> 44:10.414
Do you remember him?

44:11.048 --> 44:12.516
He was a dangerous criminal.

44:13.117 --> 44:17.021
After his death,
she took over his business.

44:17.688 --> 44:19.990
He's been in jail three times.

44:21.392 --> 44:23.360
They must have offered her
an agreement.

44:23.427 --> 44:24.728
She dropped everything.

44:25.195 --> 44:27.064
She went to work in charity.

44:28.165 --> 44:29.133
To Pari.

44:30.034 --> 44:31.969
I think she wanted
to redeem herself a little bit.

44:32.936 --> 44:35.406
She did bad things in her life.

44:37.241 --> 44:39.810
She used to be
that gang's leader.

45:13.477 --> 45:16.714
