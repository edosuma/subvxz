(MR. MALEVOLENT LAUGHING)

01:24:30.563 --> 01:24:31.664
You've done very well.

01:24:33.533 --> 01:24:38.539
So I am going to reward you
with a year of youth and beauty,

01:24:39.404 --> 01:24:41.472
my little dark princess.

01:24:41.474 --> 01:24:43.677
(LAUGHING)

01:24:46.712 --> 01:24:50.216
Do you have any more stories
for me this year, hmm?

01:24:51.650 --> 01:24:53.287
But of course.

01:24:56.456 --> 01:24:58.725
(CHUCKLING)

01:24:59.893 --> 01:25:01.558
Ah.

01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:03.096
My, my, my.

01:25:04.329 --> 01:25:07.300
Now this is the most
terrifying story of all.

01:25:08.434 --> 01:25:13.470
It's about to happen now,
and strangely enough...

01:25:13.472 --> 01:25:15.406
It's about you.
