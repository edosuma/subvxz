WEBVTT

00:44.778 --> 00:44.978
Chairs.

00:53.587 --> 00:55.289
( electricity crackles )

00:55.323 --> 00:56.624
( footsteps approach )

01:15.843 --> 01:17.878
( sighs )

01:17.911 --> 01:20.281
( door creaks )

01:20.314 --> 01:22.750
( footsteps )

01:30.291 --> 01:32.726
( thudding, creaking )

01:34.228 --> 01:35.829
Hello?

01:39.367 --> 01:40.601
- Hey.
- Hi!

01:40.634 --> 01:43.337
Am I early?
I thought we said 9:00.

01:43.371 --> 01:45.273
Uh, no, yeah.
Yeah, 9:00.

01:46.907 --> 01:48.709
She here yet?

01:48.742 --> 01:50.744
Uh, I know
her plane landed,

01:50.778 --> 01:53.747
so... as long
as she's on it.

01:53.781 --> 01:55.749
( chuckles )
The drive okay?

01:55.783 --> 01:59.553
Yeah, yeah.
It's the weekend,
plus the holiday, so...

01:59.587 --> 02:01.589
- Oh, right.
- Yeah, there was no traffic.

02:03.624 --> 02:06.327
- What's M-NET?
- Oh, uh...

02:07.695 --> 02:10.398
Mutiny's last-ditch
rebranding effort.

02:10.431 --> 02:13.301
Tried to stop the bleeding,
but, you know, still--

02:13.334 --> 02:14.668
Bled.

02:17.671 --> 02:22.243
Anyway, my VC firm
held onto the lease

02:22.276 --> 02:25.413
just in case we needed
a raw space for some
tadpole investment.

02:25.446 --> 02:26.680
( squeaking )

02:26.714 --> 02:28.649
It's pretty raw.

02:28.682 --> 02:30.518
Yeah, well,
the building
was in shambles

02:30.551 --> 02:32.353
when we moved in
four years ago.

02:32.386 --> 02:34.455
I'm sure last year's
quake didn't help.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.524
Oh, God, that was crazy.

02:36.557 --> 02:37.891
What?

02:37.925 --> 02:39.793
- The earthquake.
- Oh, yeah.

02:39.827 --> 02:42.596
- Where were you?
- Work.

02:44.698 --> 02:47.401
- How about you?
- Work.

02:48.602 --> 02:50.471
( chuckles )

02:50.504 --> 02:52.606
How come you wanted
to meet here?

02:52.640 --> 02:54.908
Oh, I didn't.

02:54.942 --> 02:57.811
Cameron did.
Who knows?
Maybe...

02:57.845 --> 03:00.214
she wanted
to see it again.

03:01.749 --> 03:02.950
Mm-hmm.

03:05.286 --> 03:07.755
By the way, I--

03:07.788 --> 03:11.292
I didn't mean to invite Gordon
without talking to you.

03:11.325 --> 03:13.561
- No, no, it's fine.
- But I--

03:13.594 --> 03:15.896
I just read the paper
and I thought it was
something phenomenal,

03:15.929 --> 03:18.966
and he's still running
the regional network we built,

03:18.999 --> 03:21.469
so it was a no-brainer.

03:21.502 --> 03:22.670
Makes perfect sense.

03:23.771 --> 03:25.473
I'm so sorry about that.

03:25.506 --> 03:27.541
No, really, it's fine.
I'm glad he's coming.

03:27.575 --> 03:30.844
No, I-- the divorce.

03:30.878 --> 03:33.414
Oh. Right.

03:33.447 --> 03:35.483
( stammering )
That the two of you...

03:35.516 --> 03:37.685
- Yeah.
- ...got a divorce.

03:41.855 --> 03:44.292
Anyway...

03:44.325 --> 03:46.494
- I really appreciate it.
- It's no problem.

03:46.527 --> 03:48.962
I mean, it's just
a couple of days
for us to see

03:48.996 --> 03:50.864
if there's even
a "there" there.

03:50.898 --> 03:53.534
Yeah, of course.
( chuckles )

03:53.567 --> 03:57.037
But... I'm excited.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.707
I'm excited, too.

03:59.740 --> 04:02.710
I'm really excited.
I--

04:02.743 --> 04:04.712
Hey, sorry I'm late.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.380
Is Cameron here?

04:08.582 --> 04:09.683
Hey!

04:09.717 --> 04:11.285
Hey!

04:11.319 --> 04:14.788
How long has it been?
What was that, April?

04:14.822 --> 04:17.057
Yeah, it was actually
two Aprils ago.

04:17.090 --> 04:20.628
- Oh, jeez,
it's been that long?
- Yeah. Yeah.

04:20.661 --> 04:23.063
- Well, you look good.
- So do you.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.599
No, I mean it, you look--
you look good.

04:27.568 --> 04:29.470
Thank you.

04:29.503 --> 04:32.005
Hey, can I, uh...

04:32.039 --> 04:33.874
( whispering )
Can you give us a sec?

04:33.907 --> 04:36.477
Oh, of course.
Absolutely. Ahem.

04:36.510 --> 04:39.079
Take all the time you...

04:39.112 --> 04:42.650
- Gordon: Um, can I...?
- Donna: Yeah.

04:42.683 --> 04:45.619
What's up?

04:45.653 --> 04:49.523
Hey, uh, you're okay
that I'm here, right?

04:49.557 --> 04:51.392
I just thought it was
an interesting concept,

04:51.425 --> 04:53.461
given everything
that I've been working on.

04:53.494 --> 04:56.096
And, you know, I haven't
seen Cameron in years.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.666
But look, I don't--
this is your thing, okay?

04:58.699 --> 05:00.868
I don't want to get in the way.
I don't want to interfere.

05:00.901 --> 05:03.337
Gordon, it's fine.
I'm glad you're here.

05:04.605 --> 05:07.007
Him? I'm not so sure.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.642
Gordon:
Yeah, I don't know.

05:08.676 --> 05:11.712
Part of the reason
we've been losing touch is...

05:11.745 --> 05:14.815
Well, you should have
seen him the last time I did.

05:30.063 --> 05:31.832
( sighs )

05:42.109 --> 05:43.644
Hey, Joe.

05:48.616 --> 05:50.050
Glad you're here.

05:56.123 --> 05:57.691
( sighs )

05:57.725 --> 06:00.594
( theme music playing )

06:28.889 --> 06:30.758
Okay,
let's just hold off
for a second

06:30.791 --> 06:32.760
on trying to talk about
what the World Wide Web is

06:32.793 --> 06:34.695
and let's focus
on what it could do.

06:34.728 --> 06:37.030
Okay, so,
here's some context.

06:37.064 --> 06:40.668
Let's say these
are the big boys,

06:40.701 --> 06:42.970
the walled gardens
we're all familiar with.

06:43.003 --> 06:45.939
You've got your Prodigy,
CompuServe, your
America Online--

06:45.973 --> 06:47.641
America Online.

06:47.675 --> 06:48.942
What kind of name
is that, anyways?

06:48.976 --> 06:50.778
It sounds like
a Neil Diamond song.

06:50.811 --> 06:54.982
* We're coming
to America... Online! *

06:55.015 --> 06:56.216
* We're com--

06:56.249 --> 06:59.587
Okay, and then
we've got NSFNET.

06:59.620 --> 07:01.622
Now, what Berners-Lee
is proposing in this paper

07:01.655 --> 07:05.125
is an application
that could run on this
network of networks.

07:05.158 --> 07:08.228
And now, well,
NSFNET isn't for
commercial use yet,

07:08.261 --> 07:10.564
and it isn't, you know,
sexy at all--

07:10.598 --> 07:14.067
Hey, hey, come on.
NSFNET's dripping with sex.

07:14.101 --> 07:17.104
The size and scope of that
would be formidable.

07:17.137 --> 07:19.740
Still, it's completely separate
from the walled gardens,

07:19.773 --> 07:21.642
where all the real money is.

07:21.675 --> 07:24.578
Right now,
unifying all these networks
is essentially impossible.

07:24.612 --> 07:26.647
There's different software,
different protocols,

07:26.680 --> 07:29.683
different operating system
on different hardware.

07:29.717 --> 07:33.186
But if something like
the World Wide Web expands,

07:33.220 --> 07:35.489
what it ultimately
could do...

07:37.958 --> 07:39.993
is this, right?

07:40.027 --> 07:41.962
Well, no, not really.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.964
No.

07:43.997 --> 07:45.966
Sorry, I know I wasn't
exactly invited.

07:45.999 --> 07:47.000
May I?

07:49.069 --> 07:50.604
Thanks.

07:50.638 --> 07:52.039
Okay, uh...

07:52.072 --> 07:56.744
if I'm understanding this
correctly,

07:56.777 --> 08:00.614
an implementation
would somehow

08:00.648 --> 08:03.851
take these massive
online networks

08:03.884 --> 08:05.986
and do this.

08:06.019 --> 08:08.956
No, no,
you've got it
backwards.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.958
Can you give me the thing?

08:12.560 --> 08:14.194
Good.

08:15.863 --> 08:17.230
Oh.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.569
It's this, isn't it?

08:21.602 --> 08:25.005
Remember,
the World Wide Web
and NSFNET,

08:25.038 --> 08:27.207
or the Internet,
or whatever you want
to call it,

08:27.240 --> 08:28.909
are two different things.

08:28.942 --> 08:32.880
The Web runs on top
of the Internet.

08:32.913 --> 08:35.849
It unifies everything.
It makes it one network.

08:35.883 --> 08:38.786
And that's the incredible
potential behind something
like this.

08:38.819 --> 08:41.589
Right now the online world
is the Tower of Babel.

08:41.622 --> 08:43.691
This is the Rosetta Stone.

08:43.724 --> 08:47.060
And it's running on
state-of-the-art NeXT
hardware and software.

08:47.094 --> 08:49.162
( stammering )
That's my biggest problem.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.198
NeXTSTEP is not a problem;
it's perfect.

08:51.231 --> 08:53.734
Okay, yeah, but I run
a network that's not
just on a whiteboard.

08:53.767 --> 08:54.935
All right,
here we go.

08:54.968 --> 08:57.170
The NeXT is
a state-of-the-art system.

08:57.204 --> 09:00.674
Designed by a disgraced
megalomaniac who loves
form over function.

09:00.708 --> 09:03.711
No wonder you love the NeXT.
Look, if we're talking
about a network

09:03.744 --> 09:07.114
that lives exclusively
on a ridiculously overpriced
machine

09:07.147 --> 09:10.784
that doesn't really play nice
with anything else in the
technological landscape,

09:10.818 --> 09:12.820
what we're really
looking at...

09:12.853 --> 09:14.187
Oh. Well, please...

09:14.221 --> 09:16.256
- Is this.
- ...be my guest.

09:16.289 --> 09:18.291
A tiny little
desert island

09:18.325 --> 09:20.861
that nobody
gives a shit about.

09:20.894 --> 09:21.895
( chuckles )

09:21.929 --> 09:24.865
Cameron?
What do you think?

09:28.301 --> 09:29.703
Okay.

09:29.737 --> 09:32.305
Um...

09:32.339 --> 09:34.775
say we're all talking
the same way.

09:34.808 --> 09:37.878
Cool.
What are we saying?

09:37.911 --> 09:40.714
Are we just
shooting the breeze?
Are we playing games?

09:40.748 --> 09:43.016
Are we looking
to get laid?

09:43.050 --> 09:45.653
- Are we just
mindlessly shopping?
- That's an excellent point.

09:45.686 --> 09:48.321
Content is paramount,
but this box is
the equivalent

09:48.355 --> 09:51.391
of a 500,000-seat
state-of-the-art stadium,

09:51.424 --> 09:55.328
and we build that,
we own that, we win.

09:55.362 --> 09:57.164
But what's the point
of having a giant stadium

09:57.197 --> 09:59.099
if you don't
have a kickass band
to play the venue?

09:59.132 --> 10:02.169
Whoa, whoa, whoa, guys,
the last thing that we need
to do right now

10:02.202 --> 10:05.272
is hop in the car and
race out to the parking lot
of an empty stadium

10:05.305 --> 10:06.940
before rock and roll
is even invented.

10:06.974 --> 10:09.209
Hey, guys,
we are early.

10:09.242 --> 10:11.712
And I'm not talking,
"Let's all just run down
to the IHOP

10:11.745 --> 10:13.781
and grab
some silver dollar
pancakes" early.

10:13.814 --> 10:15.983
We are years and years
early on this.

10:16.016 --> 10:18.018
Trust me, okay?
This is what I do.

10:18.051 --> 10:20.120
- I can't believe
you don't see this.
- Look, I agree.

10:20.153 --> 10:23.423
Okay, the World Wide Web
could be the next best thing
since sliced bread.

10:23.456 --> 10:26.226
But right now, it's a tiny
little academic petri dish

10:26.259 --> 10:28.195
- running on a NeXT computer.
- In Europe.

10:28.228 --> 10:31.264
- Yes, is Europe.
- Then what exactly
are we all doing here?

10:31.298 --> 10:35.302
Okay, hold on, hold on.
Just-- let's not lose
the shared idea here.

10:35.335 --> 10:39.807
There's a shared protocol.
This is a universal language.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.209
- So it's Esperanto.
- What the heck is Esperanto?

10:42.242 --> 10:44.745
It's a language for idiots
that failed.

10:44.778 --> 10:47.848
Okay, you know what?
Let's-- why don't we
take a break for lunch?

10:47.881 --> 10:49.783
It's, like, 10:30.

10:49.817 --> 10:51.952
I mean, I could eat.
Sure.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.975
( footsteps approaching )

11:51.044 --> 11:52.946
Gordon went out
to get some pizza.

11:52.980 --> 11:55.916
I figured maybe
it'd been a while since
you had that in Japan.

11:55.949 --> 11:59.452
There's a Domino's
around the corner
from our apartment.

11:59.486 --> 12:00.821
Oh.

12:04.892 --> 12:06.894
Look, you came all this way.

12:06.927 --> 12:09.162
It just seems like
you don't want to be here.

12:09.196 --> 12:11.398
I said I'd listen.

12:11.431 --> 12:14.334
Donna, it's not like
this is the only thing
we're doing stateside.

12:14.367 --> 12:17.771
I have a meeting with Atari.
Tom has to meet with SEGA U.S.--

12:17.805 --> 12:20.373
And you're doing Christmas
in Texas with his family,
I know.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.910
Cam, we planned
this whole thing
around your travel.

12:26.446 --> 12:28.782
In Vegas you said
this was a good idea.

12:31.051 --> 12:33.420
It is a good idea.

12:33.453 --> 12:36.123
But is also has severe
limitations in reality.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.845
It's good
to see you, Joe.

12:59.146 --> 13:00.247
Thanks.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.019
It's good to see you
doing so well.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.891
- As opposed to...?
- No, it's just--

13:10.924 --> 13:14.427
Cameron said--
she said at COMDEX
you were--

13:14.461 --> 13:17.130
you were having a bit
of a rough go of it,
that's all.

13:18.531 --> 13:20.901
I'm sorry to hear
about what happened.

13:20.934 --> 13:26.006
I never met Ryan,
but Cameron spoke
really highly of him.

13:28.608 --> 13:31.178
It was difficult.

13:31.211 --> 13:32.913
For a long time.

13:32.946 --> 13:35.082
But I'm doing
so much better

13:35.115 --> 13:37.550
since I've reconnected
with your wife.

13:55.202 --> 13:57.237
- Donna: Hold on--
- ( groans )

13:57.270 --> 13:59.206
I feel like we're
talking in circles.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.641
What we're
really looking at is...

14:01.674 --> 14:04.244
Ow!

14:04.277 --> 14:08.215
You know, I'd like to
take things in a different
direction, if I could.

14:08.248 --> 14:10.383
I'd like to talk about
what I learned in Paris.

14:10.417 --> 14:11.618
Paris?

14:11.651 --> 14:13.320
The whimsical art
of mime?

14:13.353 --> 14:16.189
I went to the Hypertext
Conference a few weeks ago.

14:16.223 --> 14:18.025
- The what conference?
- Hypertext.

14:18.058 --> 14:21.995
Some pretty big names
were there-- Apple, Xerox.

14:22.029 --> 14:24.097
- I'm surprised you
didn't hear about it.
- Yeah, me, too.

14:24.131 --> 14:25.966
It was right after
I saw you in COMDEX.

14:25.999 --> 14:28.101
Okay, so,
Hypertext Conference.

14:28.135 --> 14:31.504
Berners-Lee was there
and he was talking to
anyone who would listen.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.641
He handed out
the entire Web toolkit,
the transfer protocol,

14:34.674 --> 14:38.211
the mark-up language,
the server software,
everything.

14:38.245 --> 14:40.547
- Wait, you met him?
- You have all of that?

14:40.580 --> 14:43.650
- Yeah.
- That would have been useful
to know this morning, maybe.

14:43.683 --> 14:48.221
What's so interesting
about a programming language
like Hypertext--

14:48.255 --> 14:50.924
It's not a programming language,
it's just a text that accesses
other texts.

14:50.958 --> 14:54.261
Yes,
I'm actually talking about
HTML, the mark-up language.

14:54.294 --> 14:56.964
What's so interesting
about it is its simplicity.

14:56.997 --> 14:58.498
With a very basic
set of rules,

14:58.531 --> 15:01.268
you can create pages
of information, objects,

15:01.301 --> 15:04.271
and eventually media
when the bandwidth increases.

15:04.304 --> 15:06.673
So, I cornered
the guys at CERN.

15:06.706 --> 15:08.575
Sorry, what is CERN?

15:08.608 --> 15:11.578
CERN.
European Organization
for Nuclear Research.

15:11.611 --> 15:14.114
Oh, right, nuclear research.
Okay, I see the connection.

15:14.147 --> 15:16.216
Sorry, I'm not hearing
the "C" word in it.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.318
Nobody was paying
any attention to them.

15:18.351 --> 15:21.654
In a way, they reminded me
of Gordon and Donna,
COMDEX '81.

15:21.688 --> 15:23.390
- Oh, yeah.
- What, pathetic?

15:23.423 --> 15:25.192
Devastatingly handsome?

15:25.225 --> 15:27.995
Geniuses ahead of their time.

15:28.028 --> 15:31.231
Berners-Lee handed out
guidebooks not only for HTML,

15:31.264 --> 15:34.101
but HTTP,
the transfer protocol,

15:34.134 --> 15:37.637
the call-and-response process
for moving information like this
across to potential networks.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.339
Addressing protocol
is TCP/IP.

15:39.372 --> 15:42.309
But HTTP is the abstraction
application layer protocol

15:42.342 --> 15:45.645
that sits on top of TCP/IP
symbiotically, right, Tom?

15:45.678 --> 15:49.016
With HTTP,
any machine can
become a client,

15:49.049 --> 15:51.518
any machine
can become a server,
easily exchanging files.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.220
No, files are FTP,

15:53.253 --> 15:55.155
as in File Transfer
Protocol.

15:55.188 --> 15:57.124
It's the one that has
"file" in the name of it.

15:57.157 --> 16:00.627
What I am saying is
HTTP will eventually
supplant FTP.

16:00.660 --> 16:03.496
What I'm saying is
it can do it all.

16:03.530 --> 16:05.165
That's interesting.

16:05.198 --> 16:06.766
Really? FTP?
That's interesting?

16:06.799 --> 16:09.769
I'd like to get back
to an important point--

16:09.802 --> 16:11.504
simplicity.

16:11.538 --> 16:15.508
Both HTML and HTTP
are breathtakingly simple.

16:15.542 --> 16:18.511
And this kind of elegance
allows for versatility,

16:18.545 --> 16:20.513
it allows for universality--

16:20.547 --> 16:22.615
Yes, a universal language,
like I said.

16:22.649 --> 16:25.752
And the best part is,
the online catalogue viewer,

16:25.785 --> 16:29.122
the transfer protocol,
the Web server software,

16:29.156 --> 16:31.324
all of it is free.

16:31.358 --> 16:33.393
I have a problem
with open source.

16:33.426 --> 16:35.028
- You do?
- Yeah, I do.

16:35.062 --> 16:36.663
Do you know how many
bad video game pitches

16:36.696 --> 16:38.531
I sit through
every single day?

16:38.565 --> 16:42.235
The only way SEGA stays SEGA,
or Nintendo stays Nintendo,

16:42.269 --> 16:46.206
is by not turning
those pitches into products.

16:46.239 --> 16:47.707
- That's not--
- No, no.

16:47.740 --> 16:50.143
Because open source

16:50.177 --> 16:52.245
allows the lunatics
to run the asylum.

16:52.279 --> 16:53.680
And every time--
every time--

16:53.713 --> 16:56.049
you put well-made code
out into the world,

16:56.083 --> 16:58.718
for people
to screw around with,

16:58.751 --> 17:01.754
it causes major problems.

17:01.788 --> 17:04.724
I mean,
just look what happened
to MacMillan Utility.

17:04.757 --> 17:06.693
- What are you doing?
- What?

17:06.726 --> 17:08.261
What happened
to MacMillan Utility?

17:08.295 --> 17:10.697
Um, gee.
The release of their
source code online

17:10.730 --> 17:12.799
vaporized millions
of shareholder dollars.

17:12.832 --> 17:15.302
- And, long story short,
you're not around anymore.
- Okay!

17:17.737 --> 17:20.073
- Or you could look at it
a different way.
- Uh-huh.

17:20.107 --> 17:22.642
That with everyone
creating something
like the Web together,

17:22.675 --> 17:25.178
some potentially amazing
things could happen.

17:25.212 --> 17:27.214
One, it gets built
very fast.

17:27.247 --> 17:29.382
Two, it becomes
huge in size.

17:29.416 --> 17:33.253
Three, it's constantly
being edited and refined,

17:33.286 --> 17:35.488
so it's improving
at a massive rate.

17:35.522 --> 17:37.724
And four,
there's no overlord
controlling things.

17:37.757 --> 17:39.859
Gordon:
And what network

17:39.892 --> 17:43.330
is this giant, miraculous
nebula of collaboration
happening on?

17:43.363 --> 17:46.299
You know as well as I do
that something like this could
change the face of the Internet.

17:46.333 --> 17:49.402
The Internet
is not available
for commercial use.

17:49.436 --> 17:52.672
Do you know how much money
I poured into lobbying, trying
to get deregulation through?

17:52.705 --> 17:55.742
Look, everybody wants this
and it's gonna happen
eventually.

17:55.775 --> 17:58.845
But we are early,
and it's all about timing.

17:58.878 --> 18:02.215
If the timing's off, we're dead.
Timing's what killed Mutiny.

18:02.249 --> 18:04.651
- Timing didn't kill Mutiny.
- I'm sorry...

18:04.684 --> 18:07.320
The right people
make it the right time.

18:07.354 --> 18:09.156
We can move this forward.

18:09.189 --> 18:11.458
We can be the people
that make that future happen.

18:11.491 --> 18:13.360
- Oh, my God.
- What?

18:13.393 --> 18:16.296
I'm so sick of hearing
about the future.

18:16.329 --> 18:20.900
What is that?
The future is just another
crappy version of the present.

18:20.933 --> 18:23.570
It's some bribe
people offer you

18:23.603 --> 18:25.672
to make you do what they want
instead of what you want.

18:28.208 --> 18:30.177
This future
can be different.

18:40.387 --> 18:43.523
( laughs )

18:43.556 --> 18:46.359
Oh, Jesus, that should be
on your business card, Joe.

18:46.393 --> 18:48.728
How many times
are you people
gonna fall for this?

18:50.630 --> 18:52.632
You know,
I'm with Joe.

18:52.665 --> 18:55.235
I can't believe
I'm saying that,
but I'm with Joe.

18:55.268 --> 18:57.570
Of course you're with Joe.
You guys are the money people.

18:57.604 --> 18:59.739
But it's me and Cameron
that actually have to do it.

18:59.772 --> 19:02.342
- Look, nobody's doing
anything yet--
- Exactly.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.812
( knocks on table )
Yeah, uh, guys,
it's been fun,

19:05.845 --> 19:07.480
but I think we're
gonna hit the road.

19:07.514 --> 19:09.316
Yeah, it's been,
uh, thorough.

19:09.349 --> 19:11.784
Yeah, okay, we can call it
a day and reconvene
in the morning.

19:18.925 --> 19:21.228
Well,
you know, maybe--

19:21.261 --> 19:23.330
maybe tomorrow
will go better.

19:23.363 --> 19:25.598
There's not gonna
be a tomorrow.

19:32.505 --> 19:33.873
Hey, Cameron?

19:39.446 --> 19:41.581
Come back tomorrow.

19:41.614 --> 19:43.383
You flew halfway
across the world.

19:43.416 --> 19:46.386
Donna's trying.
Just give her a chance.

19:46.419 --> 19:47.687
Joe...

19:47.720 --> 19:50.189
We got to see if there's
something here.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.928
This is a mess, Joe.

19:55.962 --> 19:57.664
It's just a mess.

20:01.501 --> 20:03.336
( engine starts )

20:19.051 --> 20:20.753
"All My Ex's Live in Texas"
playing in background

20:20.787 --> 20:23.956
* All my exes
live in Texas... *

20:23.990 --> 20:26.859
( vocalizing )

20:26.893 --> 20:28.761
* Live in Texas

20:28.795 --> 20:32.699
* ...the place
I'd dearly love to be... *

20:32.732 --> 20:34.267
Come on, now.

20:34.301 --> 20:39.606
* But all my exes
live in Texas *

20:41.374 --> 20:43.676
* And that's why
I hang my hat...*

20:43.710 --> 20:45.512
Permission
to come aboard?

20:50.016 --> 20:51.784
Permission granted.

20:56.356 --> 20:59.058
( turns off radio )

20:59.091 --> 21:01.594
- Careful there
with them city shoes.
- Oh, sorry.

21:01.628 --> 21:03.663
Might wanna wait a sec
till you get your sea legs
under you.

21:03.696 --> 21:05.264
That's all right.

21:07.467 --> 21:08.801
Huh.

21:11.604 --> 21:14.073
Cool boat.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.476
Hard to sail
in a driveway,
though.

21:16.509 --> 21:18.845
Yup.

21:18.878 --> 21:20.913
Well, I was beating
that slot

21:20.947 --> 21:23.516
up between Angel Island
and Golden Gate last month,

21:23.550 --> 21:26.486
and I didn't
heel fast enough
in the shallows

21:26.519 --> 21:28.688
and I scratched the shit
out of my gelcoat.

21:28.721 --> 21:31.524
( laughs )
Well, look at you!

21:31.558 --> 21:33.493
The salty sailor.

21:34.594 --> 21:36.062
Look at you.

21:36.095 --> 21:40.633
Yeah, I know.
Just all grown up, right?

21:40.667 --> 21:43.936
Well, hell, Cameron,
you were all grown up
before I ever met you.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.838
- Beer?
- Yeah.

21:51.844 --> 21:55.014
How'd it go this morning
with Donna?

21:55.047 --> 21:56.883
How did you...?

21:56.916 --> 21:59.552
Oh, Diane told me.
Whose driveway you
think you're in?

21:59.586 --> 22:00.820
( can pops )

22:02.389 --> 22:04.691
How is Diane?

22:04.724 --> 22:06.759
She's good.
Good.

22:06.793 --> 22:09.362
- Yeah? You guys
are still--
- Yup.

22:09.396 --> 22:12.632
She still goes to work
and I stay retired.

22:12.665 --> 22:16.536
Some weekends we sail
up to Sausalito or Tiburon.

22:16.569 --> 22:19.439
Mostly go to the vineyard
if we got a couple
of extra days.

22:19.472 --> 22:21.774
So Californian.

22:21.808 --> 22:23.476
You take her to Texas yet?

22:23.510 --> 22:25.478
I have, yeah.

22:25.512 --> 22:28.080
Loved the rodeo.
Hated everything else.

22:28.114 --> 22:31.551
- ( laughs )
- And I think she was just
being polite about the rodeo.

22:33.420 --> 22:36.989
So, what's next?
Wedding bells?

22:37.023 --> 22:39.125
Oh, sure, we've talked
about it, but, no.

22:39.158 --> 22:41.961
Hell, between us
we got three kids

22:41.994 --> 22:44.897
aged 35 to 14,
and that's enough.

22:46.065 --> 22:48.635
Hey,
how's old Tommy Rendon?

22:48.668 --> 22:50.570
- Uh--
- Kids on the radar
for you yet?

22:50.603 --> 22:52.472
Ooh, no.

22:52.505 --> 22:54.173
No, I--

22:54.206 --> 22:56.709
Tom wants them, but...

22:56.743 --> 22:58.745
No. If it was up to me,
we'd just get them

22:58.778 --> 23:00.747
out of a vending machine
like everything else
in Japan.

23:00.780 --> 23:03.816
- Like what?
- Uh... edible underwear.

23:03.850 --> 23:05.752
- Come on!
- Yeah.

23:05.785 --> 23:10.022
Plus, you know,
we're just so far
from home these days.

23:10.056 --> 23:12.158
Although, what the hell
is home anymore?

23:12.191 --> 23:14.561
Well, you're here now,
ain't ya?

23:15.728 --> 23:17.664
Yeah, I'm here.

23:17.697 --> 23:22.168
It only took me 24 hours
to realize that coming back
was a mistake.

23:27.907 --> 23:29.942
Well, Donna says
it's a pretty hot idea.

23:29.976 --> 23:33.079
Had to be
to get all you yokels
in the same room again.

23:33.112 --> 23:35.982
It is.
It's just...

23:36.015 --> 23:37.817
too many cooks.

23:40.119 --> 23:41.921
Fool me twice, right?

23:44.957 --> 23:47.193
Was that what happened?

23:47.226 --> 23:48.695
You got fooled?

23:51.764 --> 23:55.835
And also I just have
my own thing going on
that I'm busy with, so...

23:55.868 --> 23:58.771
Yeah. Space Bike.

23:58.805 --> 24:00.239
Yeah.

24:00.272 --> 24:02.642
That's right, I got it.
I tried it out.

24:02.675 --> 24:06.078
- Really?
- Well, look--

24:06.112 --> 24:07.747
well,
it's not for me.

24:07.780 --> 24:11.017
I am just amazed
that you even installed it.

24:11.050 --> 24:13.786
I couldn't make
heads or tails of it,
to tell you the truth.

24:13.820 --> 24:17.156
Well,
who's that little bastard
with the chainsaw?

24:17.189 --> 24:18.725
Who's that one?

24:18.758 --> 24:20.793
And then you got
the force field thing.

24:20.827 --> 24:22.829
- Mm-hmm.
- Hell, it's like
you can't even win.

24:23.930 --> 24:26.165
Nope.

24:26.198 --> 24:28.467
No, you can't.

24:31.938 --> 24:33.172
( knocking )

24:38.177 --> 24:41.681
( stammering )
Sorry, I'm just here
for Haley's retainer.

24:41.714 --> 24:43.750
She conveniently
forgot it again.

24:43.783 --> 24:46.553
Yeah, I think
I saw it upstairs.

24:48.187 --> 24:50.857
Oh, did you
want me to--
'cause I can go--

24:50.890 --> 24:53.292
No, no, I can get it.
Come on in.

24:53.325 --> 24:56.529
You know, I, uh...

24:56.563 --> 24:59.498
still sleep up there
every night.

25:02.068 --> 25:05.538
Hey, why don't
you get yourself
a glass of wine?

25:05.572 --> 25:08.240
- Uh...
- You look like
you could use one.

25:12.044 --> 25:13.813
You know where it is.

25:15.982 --> 25:18.685
( jazz music playing )

25:21.621 --> 25:24.256
The key to the bisque
is the Parmesan toast.

25:24.290 --> 25:28.327
Four years ago,
the only Parmesan
you knew about was powdered.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.029
Yeah, well,
I still got that, too.

25:30.062 --> 25:33.032
Joanie eats it
by the spoonful.

25:33.065 --> 25:34.734
Dirty little secret?

25:34.767 --> 25:37.870
Teenage girls
are just as disgusting
as teenage boys.

25:37.904 --> 25:40.973
Well, have you seen
this thing that she does
with the chocolate syrup?

25:41.007 --> 25:42.975
And the milk?
It's atrocious.

25:43.009 --> 25:45.311
- Oh, my God.
- Ugh.

25:45.344 --> 25:47.179
Yeah,
speaking of cheese,

25:47.213 --> 25:49.782
seems like Joe MacMillan
is back in rare form.

25:49.816 --> 25:52.585
Yes, you've gone
and woken up the beast.

25:52.619 --> 25:54.587
Well, it was my only way
to get to Cameron.

25:54.621 --> 25:56.923
It was a long shot
and it didn't even work.
I had to go myself.

25:56.956 --> 25:58.958
I don't know, maybe that
didn't even work either.

25:58.991 --> 26:02.161
Yeah, well, what were you
gonna do all these years,
you know?

26:02.194 --> 26:03.963
Between work
and the kids?

26:03.996 --> 26:06.633
You know, get on a plane
and fly to Tokyo?

26:06.666 --> 26:10.369
Well, I could pitch
a terrible video game
to Tom.

26:10.402 --> 26:12.639
No, no, no.

26:12.672 --> 26:15.274
You would never get
a meeting with someone
as important as Tom.

26:15.307 --> 26:17.844
( both laughing )

26:17.877 --> 26:20.680
- You know, if they do
come back tomorrow...
- Yeah?

26:20.713 --> 26:22.815
I got this really
great idea for them.

26:22.849 --> 26:24.751
- Yeah, what's that?
- For a video game.

26:24.784 --> 26:28.054
Basically,
it's this conveyor belt

26:28.087 --> 26:29.922
filled with
all these light bulbs,

26:29.956 --> 26:32.091
but you have to shit on them
before they turn on.

26:32.124 --> 26:34.160
Wait, I have
the perfect title.

26:34.193 --> 26:35.628
- Mm-hmm.
- Ready?

26:35.662 --> 26:37.864
"You're an Asshole."

26:47.206 --> 26:49.742
Listen, I--

26:49.776 --> 26:52.378
I apologize today
for calling you
a money person.

26:52.411 --> 26:54.013
- Oh.
- I didn't mean it.

26:54.046 --> 26:56.382
It just kind of
came out.

26:56.415 --> 26:59.752
Oh. It's true, though.

26:59.786 --> 27:01.854
These days.

27:01.888 --> 27:04.857
I don't know,
maybe it was a mistake--

27:04.891 --> 27:08.828
bringing everybody
back together and trying
to fix things.

27:08.861 --> 27:12.164
Yeah, well,
if nobody shows up tomorrow,
I'm still interested.

27:12.198 --> 27:15.167
Really?
It didn't seem
like that today.

27:15.201 --> 27:19.005
What the--
all I said was,
you're early.

27:19.038 --> 27:21.974
Okay, it's a disservice
to everyone if I didn't
say that.

27:22.008 --> 27:24.043
You know, and look,
I've--

27:24.076 --> 27:25.344
I've been wrong before.

27:25.377 --> 27:27.213
I'll be the first
to admit that.

27:31.818 --> 27:34.687
Can I ask you
a weird question?

27:34.721 --> 27:36.288
Yeah, shoot.

27:38.190 --> 27:41.761
Are you having just
a ton of sex these days?

27:44.931 --> 27:46.332
Um...

27:48.868 --> 27:51.370
I do all right.

27:51.403 --> 27:54.741
How about you?

27:54.774 --> 27:56.776
Yeah. Same.

27:58.845 --> 28:00.146
Huh.

28:01.313 --> 28:04.050
Uh, are you--

28:04.083 --> 28:06.385
are you seeing anyone
right now?

28:09.789 --> 28:11.057
Nope.

28:13.359 --> 28:17.797
Good. 'Cause there's
something really weird
I want to ask you.

28:21.133 --> 28:23.169
Would you be open to...

28:23.202 --> 28:25.037
meeting someone?

28:25.071 --> 28:27.940
Like, for a date?

28:27.974 --> 28:31.043
I think you and this guy
would really hit it off.

28:31.077 --> 28:32.344
What?

28:32.378 --> 28:35.047
Yeah, there's this
really great guy I know.

28:35.081 --> 28:38.017
He runs the computer lab
programs at Cal.

28:38.050 --> 28:42.454
He's really nice
and I just thought,

28:42.488 --> 28:45.291
you're free, he's free...

28:52.264 --> 28:53.766
I don't know.

29:06.979 --> 29:10.817
( keyboard clicking )

29:10.850 --> 29:12.819
What are you doing?

29:12.852 --> 29:14.987
I'm trying to finish
this presentation.

29:15.021 --> 29:17.356
My battery died,
so I'm using yours.

29:20.960 --> 29:23.362
Is that okay?

29:23.395 --> 29:25.197
Yeah, it's fine.

29:28.500 --> 29:30.870
How's Bos?

29:30.903 --> 29:32.805
Yeah, he's good.

29:32.839 --> 29:35.074
Oh, look...

29:35.107 --> 29:37.109
I know today
wasn't fun for you,

29:37.143 --> 29:40.146
so if you don't want
to come back tomorrow,
you don't have to.

29:41.413 --> 29:44.516
- So, you're going?
- Well...

29:44.550 --> 29:47.319
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Okay, well, I guess
I'm going, too.

29:48.554 --> 29:50.156
Good.

29:52.424 --> 29:54.326
Let me get in the shower.

30:00.299 --> 30:02.401
( door closes )

30:24.090 --> 30:24.623
( marker squeaking )

30:42.909 --> 30:45.277
What's up with him?

30:45.311 --> 30:47.513
He says he needs
five minutes.

30:47.546 --> 30:49.081
Huh.

30:51.984 --> 30:56.655
Wow. Man, did I wake up
with a headache
this morning.

30:56.688 --> 31:00.159
Hey, you left
kind of fast last night.

31:00.192 --> 31:02.028
I hope I didn't
say anything dumb.

31:02.061 --> 31:04.430
You know,
about the date.

31:04.463 --> 31:06.532
Gordon, it's fine.

31:06.565 --> 31:09.936
Oh, great.
I mean, you know, good.

31:09.969 --> 31:12.104
I'd love his number.

31:14.406 --> 31:17.309
Unless, you know--
if it would be weird...

31:19.111 --> 31:21.447
No.

31:21.480 --> 31:24.083
No, I mean...

31:24.116 --> 31:25.451
Yeah, no problem.

31:29.688 --> 31:31.590
( door slams )

31:33.259 --> 31:34.560
Oh, you're here.

31:36.428 --> 31:38.697
( laughs )
You're all here.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.466
Let's get started.

31:40.499 --> 31:43.035
Berners-Lee wrote HTML
to view and edit the Web,

31:43.069 --> 31:45.504
HTTP so that it
could talk to itself.

31:45.537 --> 31:48.174
The chatter
could be cacophonous.

31:48.207 --> 31:51.310
It could be
deafeningly silent.

31:51.343 --> 31:56.715
Big picture--
what will the World
Wide Web become?

31:56.748 --> 31:59.986
Short answer--
who knows?

32:00.019 --> 32:01.620
Okay, so,
what's your point?

32:01.653 --> 32:03.289
It's a waste of time
to try to figure out

32:03.322 --> 32:05.257
what the Web will become.
We just don't know.

32:05.291 --> 32:06.993
Because right now,
at the end of the day,

32:07.026 --> 32:08.961
it's just an online
research catalogue

32:08.995 --> 32:11.063
running on
NeXT computers

32:11.097 --> 32:13.132
on a small network
in Europe.

32:13.165 --> 32:14.666
So, you're saying
everything we've
talked about

32:14.700 --> 32:17.169
since we got here
has been a waste of time?

32:17.203 --> 32:19.405
I'm saying,
let's take a step back.

32:19.438 --> 32:23.209
Literally, a step back.

32:23.242 --> 32:25.011
Yeah, but what is this
on the board?

32:25.044 --> 32:26.578
It's the code
for the Web browser.

32:26.612 --> 32:28.214
And you wrote it all
on the whiteboard.

32:28.247 --> 32:30.316
The online catalogue
of research?

32:30.349 --> 32:34.320
Full of Norwegian dudes,
physics papers, and particle
diagrams and stuff?

32:34.353 --> 32:36.155
Yeah, and we care
about this because why?

32:36.188 --> 32:38.024
How did we all
get here today?

32:38.057 --> 32:40.559
The choices we made,

32:40.592 --> 32:43.295
the sheer force of our will,
something like that?

32:43.329 --> 32:46.532
Here's another answer--
the winds of fate.

32:46.565 --> 32:49.201
Random coincidence,
some unseen hand

32:49.235 --> 32:51.637
just pushing us along.

32:51.670 --> 32:53.539
Destiny.

32:53.572 --> 32:56.575
How did we all
get here today?

33:00.179 --> 33:02.781
We walked through
this door.

33:02.814 --> 33:05.684
We don't have to build
a big white box or a stadium,

33:05.717 --> 33:07.619
or invent rock and roll.

33:07.653 --> 33:10.022
The moment we decide
what the Web is,
we've lost.

33:10.056 --> 33:12.058
The moment we try
to tell people what
to do with it,

33:12.091 --> 33:13.292
we've lost.

33:13.325 --> 33:15.627
All we have to do

33:15.661 --> 33:17.663
is build a door

33:17.696 --> 33:19.731
and let them inside.

33:21.700 --> 33:23.569
When I was five,

33:23.602 --> 33:25.437
my mother took me
to the city.

33:25.471 --> 33:29.075
And we went through
the Holland Tunnel,
and it was basic.

33:29.108 --> 33:31.443
Concrete and steel.

33:31.477 --> 33:34.813
But it was also my excitement
sitting in the backseat,

33:34.846 --> 33:38.350
wondering when it was
going to be our turn
to emerge.

33:38.384 --> 33:40.552
It was the explosion
of sunlight.

33:40.586 --> 33:42.554
And when we exited
the tunnel,

33:42.588 --> 33:46.558
all of Manhattan
was laid out before us.

33:46.592 --> 33:48.760
And that was the best part
of the trip--

33:48.794 --> 33:53.365
the amazing possibility
to be able to go anywhere

33:53.399 --> 33:57.236
within something
that is magnificent
and never-ending.

33:57.269 --> 34:00.772
This is the first
Web browser,

34:00.806 --> 34:04.076
the rudimentary one
CERN built to view
and edit research.

34:04.110 --> 34:06.845
I wrote it up here for you
to see how simple it is.

34:06.878 --> 34:10.816
It takes up one whiteboard--
that's basic concrete and steel.

34:10.849 --> 34:14.753
But we can take this
and we can build a door,

34:14.786 --> 34:18.090
and we can be
the first ones to do it.

34:18.124 --> 34:20.692
Because right now,
everyone else sees this as--

34:20.726 --> 34:22.428
As an online
research catalogue.

34:22.461 --> 34:24.196
Running on NeXT.

34:24.230 --> 34:26.565
On a network in Europe.

34:26.598 --> 34:30.269
And with this handful of code,
we can build the Holland Tunnel.

34:35.774 --> 34:37.676
I don't see it.

34:40.246 --> 34:42.648
I don't.
I mean, is it a door,
or is it a tunnel?

34:42.681 --> 34:44.816
Or is it the Tower of Babel?

34:44.850 --> 34:47.386
Or is it a Rosetta Stone,
or is it a stadium?

34:47.419 --> 34:48.887
You can't even decide
on a metaphor.

34:48.920 --> 34:51.557
And if the big idea here
is the browser,

34:51.590 --> 34:55.494
and it's that easy
to build, then it's
not a big idea at all.

34:55.527 --> 34:57.796
It's a foregone
conclusion.

34:57.829 --> 35:00.366
And how can we win
at something when anyone--

35:00.399 --> 35:02.534
anyone, including
Xerox and Apple

35:02.568 --> 35:05.537
and all the actual
players from your little
Hypertext shindig,

35:05.571 --> 35:07.806
can step in
at any moment
and crush us?

35:09.408 --> 35:11.177
It will be
competitive,

35:11.210 --> 35:13.812
because whoever owns the door
can charge admission.

35:13.845 --> 35:16.248
But I sincerely believe
that with the people
in this room,

35:16.282 --> 35:18.184
we have a chance
to build the best--

35:18.217 --> 35:21.387
And what makes you think
you have all the people
in this room, Joe?

35:23.622 --> 35:25.524
Come on, Cam,
let's go.

35:29.961 --> 35:31.730
Come on, Cam.
Let's go.

35:40.772 --> 35:42.408
Let's cut
the bullshit, Tom.

35:44.710 --> 35:48.514
- Your problem isn't the idea.
- You're right, Joe.

35:48.547 --> 35:50.582
Do you know
what my problem is?

35:50.616 --> 35:52.518
I don't want to see
Cameron end up like Ryan.

35:52.551 --> 35:53.619
Tom!

35:53.652 --> 35:55.321
You say his name
one more time--

35:55.354 --> 35:57.256
Ryan.
Do you remember him?

36:03.295 --> 36:06.198
Well, hey, lucky for us,
wives don't get a vote.

36:06.232 --> 36:07.433
You--

36:07.466 --> 36:09.268
- Donna: Oh, my God.
- Tom!

36:15.941 --> 36:17.809
( both panting )

36:20.812 --> 36:22.381
( wood cracking )

36:22.414 --> 36:23.615
( screams )

36:26.352 --> 36:27.519
Joe!

36:27.553 --> 36:28.854
Cameron:
Joe?!

36:31.523 --> 36:32.824
Cameron: Go!

36:40.699 --> 36:41.367
( woman speaking over P.A. )

36:49.375 --> 36:52.244
I know.
You're lucky
you're not dead.

36:52.278 --> 36:54.646
Listen, Joe,
if we have any chance
in hell at this,

36:54.680 --> 36:56.715
it's this kind
of personal bullshit

36:56.748 --> 36:58.617
that's going to sink us
before we even start.

36:58.650 --> 37:01.019
- Us?
- Yeah,
Cameron was right.

37:01.052 --> 37:03.722
There's no such thing
as the future, hey?

37:03.755 --> 37:05.657
All there is is now.

37:05.691 --> 37:07.526
Maybe we're not early.

37:07.559 --> 37:12.331
Maybe if we do it now,
we could be the first.

37:12.364 --> 37:15.667
Regardless,
I am done waiting.

37:15.701 --> 37:17.469
I can't let
this one get away.

37:17.503 --> 37:18.637
Then don't.

37:24.676 --> 37:26.312
Hey, he's fine.

37:26.345 --> 37:29.681
He broke his wrist,
but he's okay.

37:38.757 --> 37:40.392
What happened at COMDEX?

37:42.694 --> 37:43.929
What?
Nothing.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.802
Nothing happened.

37:55.541 --> 37:57.543
I need some air.

38:02.481 --> 38:03.982
( sighs )

38:28.674 --> 38:30.342
You okay?

38:34.880 --> 38:37.549
So easy to make Joe
the bad guy.

38:38.717 --> 38:40.719
I mean...

38:40.752 --> 38:44.356
making him the villain
takes the blame away,

38:44.390 --> 38:48.126
but in everything
that's happened with him,

38:48.159 --> 38:50.629
every single time...

38:50.662 --> 38:52.498
I deserve some
of the blame, too.

38:59.838 --> 39:03.609
And it's the same
with you, you know?

39:03.642 --> 39:05.944
Things fell apart.

39:05.977 --> 39:08.980
And you did
what you did,

39:09.014 --> 39:13.519
but a lot of it
was my fault.

39:15.787 --> 39:18.156
This is a really
cool idea.

39:18.189 --> 39:22.160
Yeah,
I think so, too!

39:22.193 --> 39:24.129
And, look,

39:24.162 --> 39:26.598
if Joe is
a problem for you,

39:26.632 --> 39:28.934
then he doesn't
have to be here.

39:28.967 --> 39:30.402
We can get rid of him.

39:49.755 --> 39:53.825
- We all patched in?
- Yeah, give it a try.

39:53.859 --> 39:56.828
Yup, we're in,
good and speedy.

39:58.163 --> 40:00.432
So, this is
your baby, huh?

40:00.466 --> 40:02.568
Yeah, the little
network that could.

40:02.601 --> 40:05.771
The DSP in this cube
is amazing.

40:05.804 --> 40:07.205
Not only are
we getting clean 56K,

40:07.238 --> 40:09.007
we can do this
at the same time.

40:09.040 --> 40:10.709
"King of Wishful Thinking"
playing in background

40:10.742 --> 40:12.844
* I'll get over you,
I know... *

40:12.878 --> 40:15.681
- Sounds pretty good, huh?
- Yeah, is that coming
off the CD-ROM?

40:15.714 --> 40:18.517
* I'll pretend my ship's
not sinking... *

40:18.550 --> 40:20.986
- ( music stops )
- We should really focus.

40:21.019 --> 40:23.989
Okay, so through NSFNET,
we can connect to CERN?

40:24.022 --> 40:26.825
Yes, but we're gonna crawl
once we jump to Europe.

40:26.858 --> 40:28.760
Why? The TAT-8
is fiber optic.

40:28.794 --> 40:31.463
Yeah, but it's also buried
along the continental shelf

40:31.497 --> 40:34.065
and constantly being
attacked by sharks.

40:34.099 --> 40:37.469
Apparently, they can sense
the electrical radiation.

40:37.503 --> 40:40.739
- I know.
- I love your mind.

40:42.240 --> 40:44.843
You know,
seven grand a pop
is still insane,

40:44.876 --> 40:46.845
and I don't know
why the cube is magnesium,

40:46.878 --> 40:49.981
but I still appreciate
a good machine.

40:50.015 --> 40:52.183
Yeah, well...

40:52.217 --> 40:55.020
you know what they say,
software comes and goes...

40:55.053 --> 40:56.988
Both:
But hardware is forever.

40:57.022 --> 40:58.824
( Donna chuckles )

41:04.029 --> 41:06.998
Okay. Do you have
everything?

41:07.032 --> 41:09.701
- Yeah.
- Okay, this is good.
This is good.

41:09.735 --> 41:11.537
Yeah, I'll knock out
my meetings today

41:11.570 --> 41:13.739
and get in
a few days early,

41:13.772 --> 41:15.607
I'll see the family,
get my bearings.

41:15.641 --> 41:20.646
I think-- I think
it will help me
recalibrate.

41:20.679 --> 41:22.080
Yeah, this is good.

41:22.113 --> 41:24.716
Yeah,
and I'll pick you up
at the airport

41:24.750 --> 41:25.884
day after tomorrow,
okay?

41:25.917 --> 41:27.919
- I'll be there.
- Okay.

41:36.562 --> 41:39.030
Wait, um...

41:39.064 --> 41:41.232
I'm really sorry
that I didn't trust you.

41:43.134 --> 41:46.538
I don't like
who I've been
this weekend.

41:48.840 --> 41:52.744
It's been a weird
situation for me, too.

41:55.647 --> 41:58.717
The other night
at the hotel,

41:58.750 --> 42:02.020
I was reading your emails
on your laptop.

42:02.053 --> 42:04.690
I can't believe
that I did that.

42:04.723 --> 42:06.157
I just couldn't get
Joe out of my head,

42:06.191 --> 42:09.194
and it was completely
irrational and I'm sorry.

42:13.965 --> 42:16.134
I just-- don't want us
to lie to one another.

42:19.638 --> 42:21.607
Because I love you.

42:25.043 --> 42:27.312
I love you, too.

42:38.223 --> 42:40.225
( sighs )

42:40.258 --> 42:42.994
- Okay.
- Okay.

42:47.633 --> 42:48.934
Joe...

42:52.103 --> 42:53.939
Joe, I am...

42:56.107 --> 43:01.312
Joe, I-- I just wanted
to apologize again
for yesterday.

43:01.346 --> 43:04.182
The way I behaved...

43:04.215 --> 43:06.351
I was way, way,
way out of line.

43:07.886 --> 43:09.655
I was out of line, too.

43:14.025 --> 43:15.160
Sorry.

43:24.202 --> 43:25.937
- I love you.
- Love you.

43:29.941 --> 43:31.677
- I'll see you.
- Okay.

43:34.946 --> 43:35.881
( engine starts )

43:52.898 --> 43:56.702
Hey, they're ready
downstairs.

43:56.735 --> 43:58.236
Donna...

44:00.872 --> 44:02.974
I can't work
with you.

44:07.779 --> 44:10.281
What?

44:10.315 --> 44:12.951
I can't work with you.

44:14.319 --> 44:17.188
It will never
be like it was.

44:17.222 --> 44:18.389
It can't be.

44:22.093 --> 44:25.997
But last night,
we-- we talked.

44:26.031 --> 44:27.733
It was good.

44:27.766 --> 44:29.300
I don't understand.

44:31.837 --> 44:35.774
You know
why I wanted us
to meet here?

44:35.807 --> 44:40.478
I just didn't want
to forget what had happened,

44:40.511 --> 44:43.715
how painful that was.

44:43.749 --> 44:45.751
Why?

44:45.784 --> 44:48.787
And then I almost
did forget last night

44:48.820 --> 44:51.857
when we talked,
when it felt good,

44:51.890 --> 44:53.391
when I was with
my friend again.

44:53.424 --> 44:59.030
And then
you reminded me

44:59.064 --> 45:01.867
how easily you toss
people aside

45:01.900 --> 45:03.835
when you feel like
they're in your way.

45:03.869 --> 45:05.937
This about Joe.

45:05.971 --> 45:09.474
No, this is about you.

45:09.507 --> 45:10.909
Jesus!

45:10.942 --> 45:14.279
I was trying
to help you.

45:14.312 --> 45:18.083
All I was ever trying
to do was help you.

45:20.385 --> 45:22.287
Well...

45:24.790 --> 45:26.992
the thing is,
Donna,

45:27.025 --> 45:29.828
I love this project...

45:32.030 --> 45:33.865
and I want to work on it.

45:40.872 --> 45:42.240
Take it.

45:44.509 --> 45:46.978
Take it.

46:11.069 --> 46:13.238
( breathing deeply )

46:18.409 --> 46:21.212
- ( engine starts )
- Damn it.

46:21.246 --> 46:24.382
- ( engine shuts off )
- ( crying )

46:35.526 --> 46:39.030
( sobbing )

47:04.289 --> 47:06.992
( touch tones beeping )

47:09.527 --> 47:11.462
It's me.
I'm headed to the office.

47:11.496 --> 47:13.198
I need a flight
to Switzerland

47:13.231 --> 47:15.166
and I need to meet
with CERN when I get there.

47:20.538 --> 47:22.140
( engine starts )

47:28.213 --> 47:30.281
( keyboard clicking )

47:35.686 --> 47:39.024
Where the hell
is Cameron?

47:39.057 --> 47:41.359
You know how long
I've been waiting,

47:41.392 --> 47:45.163
just sitting around
the last four years,
twiddling my thumbs?

47:45.196 --> 47:50.301
Maybe this futures bet we made
will finally pay off.

47:50.335 --> 47:52.637
I'm in love with her.

47:57.075 --> 47:58.643
( footsteps approach )

48:05.016 --> 48:06.684
Where's Donna?

48:06.717 --> 48:08.353
She left.

48:09.654 --> 48:13.558
"New Morning" playing

48:19.130 --> 48:24.235
All right.
Let's do this.

48:24.269 --> 48:28.606
* Can't you hear
that rooster crowing *

48:32.043 --> 48:35.146
* Rabbit running down
across the road *

48:35.180 --> 48:36.614
* Underneath
the bridge *

48:36.647 --> 48:41.352
* Where the water
flowed through? *

48:41.386 --> 48:43.654
* So happy just
to see you smile *

48:43.688 --> 48:46.992
* Underneath
that sky of blue *

48:47.025 --> 48:51.162
* On this new morning

48:51.196 --> 48:54.232
* New morning

48:54.265 --> 48:57.568
* On this new morning

49:04.542 --> 49:07.512
( theme music playing )
