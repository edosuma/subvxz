00:46.629 --> 00:47.922
<i>That's just a fact.</i>

00:50.216 --> 00:52.635
<i>They say a mammoth never forgets.</i>

00:52.719 --> 00:56.598
<i>Well, as I get older,</i>
<i>I find they don't always remember either.</i>

00:56.681 --> 01:02.520
<i>I've decided to put it all down here,</i>
<i>so it'll never change. Our herd history.</i>

01:03.605 --> 01:07.525
<i>It all started with Manny,</i>
<i>my lovable grouch of a mammoth.</i>

01:08.026 --> 01:10.278
<i>He'd lost his family to hunters.</i>

01:10.362 --> 01:12.530
- <i>Heartbreak made him a loner.</i>

01:13.698 --> 01:16.451
<i>And then there was Sid,</i>
<i>a big-hearted sloth…</i>

01:16.534 --> 01:18.578
- <i>…had been abandoned by his family</i>

01:18.661 --> 01:23.166
<i>because he could be, let's just say,</i>
<i>a little annoying.</i>

01:26.795 --> 01:30.006
- <i>And Diego, a fierce saber-tooth.</i>

01:30.090 --> 01:33.009
<i>He risked his life</i>
<i>to defy his ruthless pack</i>

01:33.093 --> 01:35.053
<i>and was left with nowhere to go.</i>

01:35.637 --> 01:38.515
<i>Fate brought this unlikely trio together</i>

01:38.598 --> 01:41.726
<i>when they were charged</i>
<i>with the care of a lost baby.</i>

01:41.810 --> 01:46.856
<i>And in returning the child to its family,</i>
<i>they became a family themselves.</i>

01:46.940 --> 01:50.110
<i>Now, Manny thought</i>
<i>he was the last mammoth in the Ice Age</i>

01:50.193 --> 01:52.946
<i>and was convinced he'd never find love.</i>

01:53.029 --> 01:55.949
<i>That is, until he met me, Ellie.</i>

01:56.032 --> 01:57.784
- <i>We felt the earth move.</i>

01:58.660 --> 02:00.995
<i>Nineteen tons of combined weight</i>
<i>will do that.</i>

02:01.788 --> 02:06.626
<i>I joined the herd along with my adopted</i>
<i>possum brothers, Crash and Eddie.</i>

02:08.378 --> 02:10.922
<i>The six of us had so many adventures.</i>

02:12.007 --> 02:15.051
<i>But every time</i>
<i>we thought it was the end of the world,</i>

02:15.135 --> 02:17.512
<i>it only brought us closer together.</i>

02:18.013 --> 02:21.307
<i>Even when we stumbled into</i>
<i>a Lost World of dinosaurs</i>

02:21.391 --> 02:23.643
- <i>living under the ice.</i>

02:25.228 --> 02:27.605
<i>We met a fearless weasel</i>
<i>named Buck.</i>

02:27.689 --> 02:31.568
<i>He was daring,</i>
<i>adventurous and a little eccentric.</i>

02:31.651 --> 02:34.112
<i>Crash and Eddie</i>
<i>wanted to be just like him.</i>

02:34.612 --> 02:36.448
<i>Now that we've found each other,</i>

02:36.531 --> 02:39.909
<i>I want to preserve</i>
<i>every moment we have together,</i>

02:39.993 --> 02:42.537
<i>because you never know</i>
<i>when things will change.</i>

02:42.620 --> 02:47.834
<i>And lately, it seems like my brothers</i>
<i>are getting a little restless.</i>

02:50.003 --> 02:52.297
I can't wait to show this to the boys.

02:53.506 --> 02:55.383
Crash! Eddie!

02:56.384 --> 02:57.427
Whoo-hoo!

03:00.180 --> 03:03.141
This is gonna be
our most extreme stunt ever.

03:08.563 --> 03:10.357
Extremely dangerous.

03:10.440 --> 03:11.983
Super-duper dangerous.

03:12.067 --> 03:13.818
Stupendously dangerous.

03:24.788 --> 03:25.789
Whoa.

03:25.872 --> 03:27.749
That's a long way down.

03:27.832 --> 03:29.876
Only if we make it to the bottom.

03:30.543 --> 03:32.712
Crash! Eddie!

03:32.796 --> 03:35.548
You better not be
doing something dangerous!

03:36.716 --> 03:38.468
You know, I've been thinking--

03:38.551 --> 03:40.428
What? When did you start doing that?

03:40.512 --> 03:41.513
Last week.

03:41.596 --> 03:43.682
And you didn't say anything?

03:43.765 --> 03:45.850
Why'd you do it, Crash? Why?

03:46.476 --> 03:48.353
We're supposed to be brothers.

03:48.436 --> 03:49.479
I couldn't help it.

03:49.562 --> 03:51.940
I was just sitting there, and I thought,

03:52.023 --> 03:55.235
"Aren't you tired of Ellie
always telling us what we can't do?"

03:55.318 --> 03:56.528
Yeah.

03:56.611 --> 03:59.906
"Don't use tar pits as a bubble bath."
"Don't gargle with fire ants."

03:59.989 --> 04:03.118
"Don't scale the side of an unstable,
10,000 foot glacier."

04:06.413 --> 04:09.040
She's smothering us
with reasonable advice.

04:09.874 --> 04:12.877
What if we move out and get our own place?

04:12.961 --> 04:15.213
Ooh! You mean a bachelor den?

04:15.296 --> 04:18.466
Nah, I was thinking more of a place
where two single guys hang out.

04:18.550 --> 04:20.176
Oh, that's way better.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.429
- Just imagine it.

04:39.654 --> 04:41.031
- Boys!

04:41.114 --> 04:43.033
Don't make me come get you.

04:45.618 --> 04:49.706
Look. I think it's time
we become independent possums.

04:56.338 --> 05:01.509
I claim this mountain
in the name of possum freedom!

05:19.819 --> 05:20.820
Crash!

05:21.446 --> 05:22.614
Eddie!

05:22.697 --> 05:24.032
- Where are those two?

05:24.115 --> 05:27.786
So that's why I've always thought
that good hygiene is overrated,

05:27.869 --> 05:32.082
but what really makes me feel special
is that you guys listen to me.

05:32.165 --> 05:35.585
You really listen. And the…

05:45.220 --> 05:49.224
Uh-huh. I'll do it later, dear. I promise.

05:49.307 --> 05:51.643
Manny! We gotta go!

05:56.606 --> 05:58.858
Ice-alanche!

05:59.818 --> 06:01.277
All right!

06:01.361 --> 06:03.238
Whee-hee-hee-hee!

06:03.321 --> 06:05.198
Whoa!

06:12.163 --> 06:13.373
Yeah!

06:15.583 --> 06:16.876
- Yay!
- Whoo-hoo!

06:26.302 --> 06:29.931
It took us all spring
to build that summer habitat!

06:30.015 --> 06:31.057
All spring!

06:31.141 --> 06:33.268
And you destroyed it in seconds!

06:33.351 --> 06:34.686
Whoo! That's a new record.

06:34.769 --> 06:37.647
It took us, like, eight minutes
to destroy our fall habitat.

06:37.731 --> 06:40.817
But why'd you build it
right in the middle of our ice-alanche?

06:40.900 --> 06:42.193
Rookie error, dude.

06:43.528 --> 06:46.031
Diego! They're all yours.

06:47.490 --> 06:49.200
- About time.

06:52.871 --> 06:55.832
Oh, great. Now I have rabies.

06:55.915 --> 06:58.960
Okay, okay.
Let's work this out like a family.

06:59.044 --> 07:03.340
Manny, use your feeling words. "I feel…"

07:03.423 --> 07:05.925
Come on. "I feel…"

07:06.509 --> 07:10.388
I feel like I'm about to crush you
like a grape.

07:10.472 --> 07:12.515
That's good. Breakthrough!

07:12.599 --> 07:14.893
Okay, look, it was an accident.

07:14.976 --> 07:16.978
Let's just try to find
a new place to sleep

07:17.062 --> 07:19.147
and you can yell at 'em in the morning.

07:19.230 --> 07:20.815
I might as well yell at rocks.

07:20.899 --> 07:24.277
If it wasn't for her protection,
you two would've been gone long ago.

07:24.361 --> 07:29.199
Ha! If it wasn't for her,
we'd be out there in the world a-roaming.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.534
Yeah! Our a-roaming skills are strong.

07:31.618 --> 07:35.538
No, your aroma is strong.
You'd never survive on your own.

07:35.622 --> 07:38.249
- We could if we wanted.
- Yeah-- Oh, yeah?

07:38.333 --> 07:41.336
- I double-dog dare you to prove it.
- Manny, stop egging them on.

07:41.419 --> 07:45.006
Well, I'm just saying, maybe they've
reached a point in their lives

07:45.090 --> 07:47.300
where they're ready to get out of my hair.

07:47.384 --> 07:53.348
I-- I mean, you know,
go find their own destiny. Huh?

07:53.431 --> 07:55.767
- Nobody's going anywhere!
- Why not?

07:55.850 --> 07:59.354
Because you can't
do anything for yourselves.

07:59.437 --> 08:02.732
Anything you can do,
we can do nearly almost as well.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.776
Can you clean your own habitat?

08:05.360 --> 08:07.070
Can you feed yourselves?

08:07.153 --> 08:09.364
Can you protect yourself from predators?

08:10.115 --> 08:13.952
Oh, sure, bring those things up.
We do things that matter.

08:14.452 --> 08:15.537
Like this.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.838
The offense rests.

08:24.921 --> 08:28.925
You know, even though you're my brothers,
sometimes I wish

08:29.009 --> 08:32.846
you were a little more mammoth
and a little less possum.

08:36.099 --> 08:38.852
She just insulted our possum-ness.

08:38.935 --> 08:42.272
Which is a very big part of who we are.

08:42.355 --> 08:45.734
That does it!
I'm done being treated like a baby.

08:45.817 --> 08:49.446
It's time for us to move out
and make our mark on the world!

08:49.529 --> 08:51.740
I make my mark on the world every day.

08:51.823 --> 08:55.285
I just lift my leg and do it.
That tree is mine, for instance.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.203
And that tree, and that one.

08:57.996 --> 09:00.874
And that rock over there.
And your pillow too!

09:13.053 --> 09:14.220
Go sleep over there.

09:14.304 --> 09:16.931
And turn on your side
so you don't keep me up snoring all night.

09:17.015 --> 09:18.350
I-- I don't snore.

09:18.433 --> 09:21.394
Trust me,
you blow that face tuba all night long.

09:21.478 --> 09:26.274
Yeah, oh-- Okay, look, I'm sorry
about what I said to Crash and Eddie.

09:26.358 --> 09:29.527
It's just-- Well, family can be difficult.

09:30.028 --> 09:33.865
We are a nutty, mixed-up herd
full of loners and outcasts.

09:34.491 --> 09:36.493
And that's just on my side.

09:36.576 --> 09:39.788
Right, and you don't hear me
complain about your side ever.

09:39.871 --> 09:41.915
My side takes care of themselves.

09:43.291 --> 09:44.834
Yeah, well, Diego does.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.338
And then we both take care of Sid.

09:48.838 --> 09:52.342
Nah, don't you gotta--
You've gotta save some for later though.

09:52.425 --> 09:55.095
Well, possum families
just aren't like that.

09:55.178 --> 10:00.642
Yeah, you know, you could let them
face consequences sometimes. Just saying.

10:00.725 --> 10:04.896
How? By kicking them out?
You know they can't survive on their own.

10:04.979 --> 10:06.606
Mmm. Interesting.

10:06.690 --> 10:09.776
Well, maybe what scares you
is that they won't need you anymore.

10:09.859 --> 10:14.114
Or maybe it's the fact that their
only natural defense is to play dead.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.324
They're my brothers.

10:16.408 --> 10:19.077
They're the only family I had before you.

10:19.160 --> 10:21.204
They saved my life, Manny.

10:47.022 --> 10:49.357
<i>Mama Possum raised me</i>
<i>as one of her own.</i>

10:49.983 --> 10:51.818
<i>I was never happier.</i>

11:16.051 --> 11:18.720
<i>I finally felt like I was home.</i>

11:28.104 --> 11:29.272
Aw…

11:34.444 --> 11:37.697
<i>And when we lost her,</i>
<i>I was heartbroken.</i>

11:38.198 --> 11:41.868
<i>But I knew my brothers and I</i>
<i>would always have each other.</i>

11:44.537 --> 11:48.333
Well, Sis, I guess
you're the head possum of the family now.

12:05.475 --> 12:08.144
You know, I lost my mama too.

12:09.104 --> 12:11.981
Well, technically, she moved away
without leaving a forwarding address.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.441
But then I found Manny here.

12:13.525 --> 12:16.152
And then, when Diego came along
and tried to kill us,

12:16.236 --> 12:18.279
we knew we were destined to be a family.

12:18.822 --> 12:21.241
Sid, don't you have somewhere else
to sleep?

12:21.324 --> 12:22.701
Don't you?

13:23.720 --> 13:26.264
We can't just leave
without saying goodbye.

13:30.935 --> 13:34.939
Goodbye, Sis.
It's time for us to make our own destiny.

13:35.023 --> 13:37.317
And maybe even make our own lunch.

13:37.859 --> 13:39.569
We may never see you again.

14:12.018 --> 14:14.104
Huh?

14:16.856 --> 14:17.941
Did you hear that?

14:18.024 --> 14:21.945
Huh? Wha-- I-- I don't hear anything.

14:22.028 --> 14:25.949
Right. It's too quiet.
Nothing's breaking. No one's fighting.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.826
That can only mean one thing.

14:27.909 --> 14:30.829
They're gone. They took all their things.

14:30.912 --> 14:32.455
They don't have any things.

14:32.539 --> 14:33.540
Exactly.

14:33.623 --> 14:36.251
Uh-oh. This is not gonna go well for you.

14:36.751 --> 14:40.755
Manny, my brothers are out there
in the wild, and it's all your fault.

14:40.839 --> 14:41.840
What, my fault?

14:41.923 --> 14:45.427
Well, you did challenge them
to try to survive on their own.

14:45.510 --> 14:47.595
In effect, sending them to their doom.

14:47.679 --> 14:48.763
Thanks, Sid.

14:48.847 --> 14:51.391
Anytime, buddy. I always got your back.

14:51.474 --> 14:52.600
Don't worry, honey.

14:52.684 --> 14:56.521
If-- If Crash and Eddie get into trouble,
they'll find their way back.

14:56.604 --> 14:57.814
Find their way back?

14:57.897 --> 15:00.066
The only thing worse
than their survival skills

15:00.150 --> 15:01.526
is their sense of direction.

15:01.609 --> 15:03.737
Mmm. And their math skills
aren't great either.

15:03.820 --> 15:05.405
Come on. We've got to find them.

15:08.992 --> 15:13.830
They also have zero musical talent.
And they're awful at bird calls.

15:19.627 --> 15:22.714
Dude, being on our own totally rules!

15:22.797 --> 15:25.967
And we've got nothing to worry about
since we've got nine lives.

15:26.051 --> 15:29.054
- Oh, come on. Everyone knows that's dogs.
- Oh.

15:29.137 --> 15:30.764
Well, how many lives do we get?

15:30.847 --> 15:32.682
I forget. It's either four or eleven.

15:36.853 --> 15:39.272
Destiny awaits!

15:43.985 --> 15:45.570
Destiny hurts.

15:51.993 --> 15:53.495
Have we been here before?

15:53.995 --> 15:56.164
It does look kinda familiar.

15:56.247 --> 15:59.125
Wait. Is this the way to the Lost World?

15:59.751 --> 16:02.462
It's the most exciting place
we've ever been!

16:03.004 --> 16:06.341
It's also the most dangerous.
Do you think we can find it?

16:06.841 --> 16:09.010
With our keen sense of direction?

16:09.678 --> 16:12.639
Puh-lease. To the Lost World!

16:14.891 --> 16:16.059
Dead end!

16:16.893 --> 16:18.269
To the Lost World!

16:34.452 --> 16:37.455
It's hopeless.
We'll never find it.

16:38.498 --> 16:39.499
Found it!

16:43.336 --> 16:45.171
Ooh.

16:46.423 --> 16:49.092
Ellie told us never,
ever to go back in there.

16:56.683 --> 16:59.602
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

17:00.770 --> 17:03.773
- To the Lost World!
- To the Lost World!

17:10.739 --> 17:12.115
Whoa!

17:13.950 --> 17:17.412
I smell mammals.

17:29.758 --> 17:30.842
Snack time.

17:40.060 --> 17:42.562
Your breath, dude.
You've gotta brush more.

17:44.439 --> 17:47.359
I think I just swallowed
my Adam's apple.

17:51.946 --> 17:54.616
One of us should give ourselves up
so the other can get away!

17:54.699 --> 17:56.743
Good idea! I volunteer you!

18:04.334 --> 18:06.628
That was close.

18:06.711 --> 18:10.548
Crash,
it's just like I remembered it!

18:16.554 --> 18:19.766
It always amazes me
there's a whole world down here.

18:19.849 --> 18:21.142
Right below our feet.

18:21.226 --> 18:23.645
And a giant spider right above our heads.

18:37.909 --> 18:39.703
We're gonna be goners!

18:39.786 --> 18:43.206
Yeah! And then
we'll only have three or ten more lives!

18:45.000 --> 18:46.751
You know that whole
"living on our own" thing?

18:46.835 --> 18:49.212
- Yeah?
- I'm starting to question our judgment!

18:49.295 --> 18:51.756
Well, this is the perfect time to do it.

19:00.390 --> 19:03.101
I remember this guy.
He's allergic to possums.

19:14.446 --> 19:15.739
Hello, boys!

19:15.822 --> 19:17.282
- Buck!
- Buck?

19:18.450 --> 19:20.994
That's right! Buck Wild, at your service.

19:21.077 --> 19:22.412
Our hero!

19:22.996 --> 19:24.831
The legend of the Lost World!

19:24.914 --> 19:26.458
The wizard of weasels!

19:26.541 --> 19:28.043
The yin to my yang!

19:28.543 --> 19:30.920
Your ways are strange
and mysterious, Buck,

19:31.004 --> 19:32.213
but mostly strange.

19:32.297 --> 19:33.506
Thanks for dropping in.

19:33.590 --> 19:36.468
Will the rest of the herd
be falling from the sky too?

19:36.551 --> 19:39.179
I don't think I can catch the mammoths.
One, maybe.

19:40.930 --> 19:43.433
Mayday! Mayday!
We're coming in hot!

19:45.977 --> 19:48.021
- Whoa!

19:50.523 --> 19:51.941
This is your captain speaking.

19:52.025 --> 19:55.987
Please keep your whiskers and bottoms
inside the dactyl at all times.

19:56.071 --> 19:57.614
Whoo-hoo!

20:03.286 --> 20:05.121
- Buck!
- Crack!

20:14.631 --> 20:18.009
You picked a bad time
for a tropical vacation, lads.

20:18.093 --> 20:21.096
A dino named Orson
just escaped from exile.

20:21.179 --> 20:24.224
And he's jonesing to rule the Lost World.

20:24.307 --> 20:26.017
Now he's got a couple of raptors.

20:26.101 --> 20:29.479
And if he succeeds,
no mammal will be safe.

20:29.562 --> 20:32.065
Whoa! Well, it's a good thing
I'm not a mammal.

20:32.148 --> 20:33.900
- You are a mammal.
- Sorry, bro.

20:33.983 --> 20:35.985
Looks like life dealt you a bad hand.

20:36.069 --> 20:37.153
You're a mammal too.

20:37.237 --> 20:38.321
That's impossible.

20:38.405 --> 20:40.949
What are the odds of two possums
being mammals?

20:41.032 --> 20:44.911
Well, they're the same odds
that you'll both be a raptor's brunch

20:44.994 --> 20:46.788
if I don't get you out of here.

20:55.005 --> 20:56.214
Got to feed Penelope.

20:58.008 --> 21:00.927
She needs gas,
and these berries will give it to her.

21:01.428 --> 21:04.305
Back off, Brenda. They're friends of mine.

21:04.389 --> 21:06.433
- Brenda.

21:07.225 --> 21:08.893
Spit.

21:10.270 --> 21:12.063
Spit.

21:15.734 --> 21:17.235
So far, best day ever!

21:17.318 --> 21:20.155
Now, tell me, what brings you two
to my world?

21:20.238 --> 21:21.322
We moved out.

21:21.406 --> 21:23.700
Yeah, we're mature now.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.076
Really?

21:25.160 --> 21:27.829
Well, at first, Ellie was all…
"Yada yada yada."

21:27.912 --> 21:30.373
And then Manny was like…
"Blah, blah, blah."

21:30.999 --> 21:32.459
Yeah, that does sound like him.

21:32.542 --> 21:34.961
And Diego was all--

21:35.045 --> 21:36.421
I mean, you know how he is.

21:36.504 --> 21:38.590
And then Ellie said, "I don't like it,

21:38.673 --> 21:41.217
but I suppose it's time.
Good luck out there."

21:41.301 --> 21:44.804
Then she hugged us, Sid scratched himself,
and bingo bongo in the Congo, we're here!

21:44.888 --> 21:47.891
You're telling me Ellie
gave her okey dokey

21:47.974 --> 21:50.226
to this little artichokey
of a mission here?

21:50.310 --> 21:51.811
Oh, yeah. Totally.

21:51.895 --> 21:53.104
- Hmm?

21:53.188 --> 21:55.273
Okay, okay. We snuck out.

21:55.357 --> 21:56.649
Ow!

21:56.733 --> 21:58.234
You try to survive that look.

22:01.696 --> 22:05.075
I admit it! Whatever it is!

22:05.158 --> 22:07.369
I've got to take you back home, fellas.

22:07.452 --> 22:09.454
I'm the only one that can stop Orson,

22:09.537 --> 22:12.707
but I won't be able to do that
if I have you two to look after.

22:12.791 --> 22:14.125
But-but-but-but, Buck,

22:14.209 --> 22:17.796
we came here to live a life
of adventure, like you.

22:17.879 --> 22:20.548
You boys are nature's least likely
to survive.

22:20.632 --> 22:23.259
And this is its most dangerous place.

22:23.343 --> 22:25.762
Wow. Talk about a perfect match.

22:34.813 --> 22:36.523
I'll be back in a minute, girl.

22:37.816 --> 22:39.275
Buck, don't send us back.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We wanna hang here with you.

22:41.903 --> 22:43.446
Please. We're independent.

22:43.530 --> 22:44.781
Both of us.

22:44.864 --> 22:45.907
Together.

22:46.408 --> 22:49.828
This boulder's not supposed to be here.
How did it get here?

22:49.911 --> 22:51.705
Hmm… How do you think?

22:51.788 --> 22:52.956
Well, how should I know?

22:53.039 --> 22:57.335
Unbelievable.
Your cluelessness is truly breathtaking.

22:57.419 --> 23:00.171
Don't you take that tone with me, Rocky.

23:00.255 --> 23:02.632
Now I insist you roll away at once.

23:02.716 --> 23:05.635
Uh, I don't think
it's the boulder talking.

23:05.719 --> 23:08.513
Well, not anymore.
I obviously intimidated him.

23:08.596 --> 23:11.933
Seems like Mr. Boulder here
is all growl and no gravel.

23:12.017 --> 23:14.561
Wow. Okay, enough.

23:14.644 --> 23:16.146
I can't do this anymore.

23:16.229 --> 23:19.149
Hey, I'm over here,
you soon-to-be ex-weasel.

23:20.108 --> 23:22.569
Look at me.
Look at me with your dumb little eye.

23:24.487 --> 23:25.655
Orson.

23:26.906 --> 23:28.324
Buck.

23:28.408 --> 23:29.534
Eddie.

23:30.535 --> 23:31.995
Crash.

23:32.078 --> 23:34.789
I heard you'd returned. But how?

23:35.290 --> 23:37.334
Nobody escapes from Lava Island.

23:37.417 --> 23:40.545
Well, not everyone
has my colossal intellect.

23:40.628 --> 23:44.341
Which is dwarfed only by your ego
and insecurity.

23:44.424 --> 23:46.343
Why'd you seal the exit, Orson?

23:46.926 --> 23:49.888
Oh, no reason. Just to keep
filthy animals like you

23:49.971 --> 23:55.101
from coming in and infecting our ecosystem
with your fur and warm blood.

23:55.185 --> 23:57.520
Lost World for lost species!

23:57.604 --> 24:00.190
Dinos rule… …mammals drool.

24:00.774 --> 24:02.233
It's true. You do.

24:03.109 --> 24:05.153
Wait a minute. Dinos don't talk.

24:05.236 --> 24:07.614
They just grunt and roar like nincompoops.

24:07.697 --> 24:10.450
That's good. Hey, that's funny.
That's really funny.

24:10.533 --> 24:12.327
Dinos have tiny brains.

24:12.410 --> 24:14.496
Like I haven't heard that a million times.

24:14.579 --> 24:17.332
Does this brain look tiny to you?

24:17.415 --> 24:19.626
Holy moly, that's huge!

24:19.709 --> 24:21.795
Seriously. That thing's a planet.

24:21.878 --> 24:24.881
I'm surprised there isn't
a little moon going around it.

24:24.964 --> 24:28.468
That kind of reaction used to hurt.
I thought I was a freak.

24:28.551 --> 24:33.807
Then I realized that my massive brain
made me the smartest creature alive!

24:34.724 --> 24:37.560
But you know the best part?
The joke's on you.

24:37.644 --> 24:40.397
My brain, the thing
that everyone ridiculed,

24:40.480 --> 24:43.274
is the one thing
that's gonna get me my revenge.

24:43.983 --> 24:46.277
I'll rule everyone under the ice!

24:46.820 --> 24:50.573
Not even you can stop me this time,
Buckmeinster.

24:53.076 --> 24:54.619
It's Buckminster.

24:56.788 --> 24:58.540
Though most call me Buck.

24:58.623 --> 25:00.834
"Buckmeinster" is not even a name.

25:00.917 --> 25:04.754
That's like me calling you "Shmorson."

25:05.338 --> 25:09.676
Whatever, Bucky. Now that I've got
some muscle behind me,

25:09.759 --> 25:12.429
it's a whole new ball game.

25:13.555 --> 25:15.432
There's gonna be a ball game?

25:15.515 --> 25:18.351
Check it out.

25:22.981 --> 25:25.775
Well, look. They've gone and died.

25:26.317 --> 25:28.028
No one wants to eat dead possums.

25:28.111 --> 25:30.655
It's too chewy.
It's like eating hairy gum.

25:30.739 --> 25:31.740
Okay.

25:31.823 --> 25:33.408
I can totally see you're breathing.

25:33.491 --> 25:36.786
Look, look-- Right there.
Look, even these morons can see it.

25:38.538 --> 25:41.124
Time for a possum picnic!

25:42.000 --> 25:43.418
Oh!

25:47.172 --> 25:48.548
Oh!

25:50.216 --> 25:53.345
Until our next tango, <i>mi iguana gigante</i>.

26:02.312 --> 26:05.565
No one outsmarts Orson!

26:06.274 --> 26:08.902
Now, we're gonna have to play
a little game called

26:08.985 --> 26:11.029
"drop goes the weasel."

26:11.112 --> 26:14.157
It means, take down Buck!

26:14.657 --> 26:17.494
Oh, my-- Geez.

26:17.577 --> 26:20.038
What did I say about boundaries, huh?

26:20.705 --> 26:22.999
And you! Stop copying me!

26:33.051 --> 26:36.012
It's not safe here, girl.
Better take off for the night.

26:38.181 --> 26:39.432
Be careful.

26:44.020 --> 26:45.105
Where to next, Buck?

26:45.605 --> 26:47.107
We're already here.

27:12.716 --> 27:14.592
Buck's bachelor den!

27:16.302 --> 27:17.637
Wow.

27:19.055 --> 27:21.016
Talk about a possum paradise.

27:21.725 --> 27:24.436
Hang on.
Gotta pay the cucumber for babysitting.

27:25.687 --> 27:29.357
Crash, wouldn't it be awesome
if we could live here with Buck?

27:29.441 --> 27:31.067
Look, I know I said
it was gonna be three hours,

27:31.151 --> 27:32.235
but it was only two, and--

27:32.318 --> 27:35.113
I'm not gonna pay for an hour
where you didn't do anything.

27:35.196 --> 27:37.699
- He's got everything.
- I'll pay you for three.

27:37.782 --> 27:39.868
You drive a hard bargain
for a salad pincher.

27:39.951 --> 27:42.704
Right, I just hope you didn't spend
the whole time talking to your boyfriend.

27:45.165 --> 27:46.666
You remember my daughter?

27:46.750 --> 27:48.126
Bronwyn!

27:48.626 --> 27:52.964
She's gotten so big and round, and big.

27:53.048 --> 27:54.549
These are your uncle possums.

27:55.050 --> 27:57.802
She doesn't remember you
because she was so young.

27:57.886 --> 27:59.304
And also 'cause she's a squash.

27:59.387 --> 28:03.808
Buck, I know you like living alone here
with your farm-fresh daughter,

28:03.892 --> 28:06.770
but wouldn't it be nice
to have a couple of roommates?

28:06.853 --> 28:08.313
Free pumpkin care.

28:08.396 --> 28:10.106
And we charge less than cucumbers.

28:10.190 --> 28:13.777
Sorry, boys. I'm a solo operator
who can't be tied down.

28:13.860 --> 28:16.321
You can stay until I've stopped Orson,
but after that,

28:16.404 --> 28:19.074
I'm gonna find a way to get you back home.

28:19.157 --> 28:21.701
Well, maybe we could help you stop Orson.

28:21.785 --> 28:23.536
Dude, up top!

28:35.507 --> 28:36.800
Crash!

28:36.883 --> 28:37.926
Eddie!

28:38.426 --> 28:42.514
I don't mean to be a negative Nancy,
but they've been gone a while.

28:42.597 --> 28:45.600
Shouldn't we just be
looking for bones at this point?

28:47.018 --> 28:49.646
I respectfully withdraw the question.

28:50.271 --> 28:51.272
Hey, Über-tracker,

28:51.356 --> 28:52.941
- you picked up that scent yet?

28:53.024 --> 28:56.861
Aside from you,
nothing smells bad. So, no.

28:58.029 --> 29:02.200
Manny, they're out there all alone
in the cold. They're probably frightened.

29:02.283 --> 29:04.994
Look, don't worry. We'll find them.

29:05.078 --> 29:08.248
Because if we don't find them,
I'm gonna kill them.

29:09.416 --> 29:12.627
It's a figure of speech. And ow!

29:18.800 --> 29:19.968
Ha, ha, ha!

29:20.051 --> 29:22.637
You've got nowhere to run, Orson!

29:23.388 --> 29:26.307
Or should I say Shmorson.

29:33.523 --> 29:37.027
So, how are you gonna defeat
this Shmorson dude anyway?

29:37.110 --> 29:38.862
That is a good question, Crash.

29:38.945 --> 29:41.281
- I'm Eddie, the handsome one.
- Right.

29:41.364 --> 29:43.575
Back in the day,
Orson was tough on his own.

29:43.658 --> 29:45.493
But now he's got some trained raptors,

29:45.577 --> 29:48.580
taking him down
is gonna be a little bit trickier.

29:48.663 --> 29:50.248
Why is he such a meanie anyway?

29:50.331 --> 29:51.708
Another good question, Eddie.

29:51.791 --> 29:53.585
I'm Crash, the other handsome one.

29:53.668 --> 29:58.048
When he was young, Orson was teased
and got all insecure about his big head.

29:58.131 --> 30:00.425
The bigger his head grew,
so too did his brain.

30:00.508 --> 30:03.428
And he realized
that this was his greatest strength.

30:03.511 --> 30:07.349
But he came to believe
he was superior to everyone else.

30:07.432 --> 30:09.309
I tried to show him we were all equals.

30:09.392 --> 30:12.354
I even invited him to be part of
this team I belonged to.

30:14.689 --> 30:16.691
<i>We established the watering hole</i>
<i>as a place</i>

30:16.775 --> 30:20.195
<i>where all species</i>
<i>could learn to peacefully coexist.</i>

30:20.904 --> 30:23.656
- <i>My team was dedicated to protecting it</i>

30:23.740 --> 30:26.785
<i>and making sure all animals down here</i>
<i>lived in harmony.</i>

30:28.536 --> 30:29.954
Whoa!

30:30.580 --> 30:32.207
Like a superhero squad?

30:32.290 --> 30:35.543
Well, I wouldn't use the term "superhero."

30:35.627 --> 30:38.588
I mean, I wouldn't stop you
from using it. Anyway.

30:39.798 --> 30:41.549
<i>Orson turned down my offer.</i>

30:44.219 --> 30:45.804
<i>He didn't believe in harmony.</i>

30:45.887 --> 30:49.182
<i>He believed in a world</i>
<i>where the strong dominate the weak.</i>

30:50.975 --> 30:52.727
Hello! Can you repeat that?

30:52.811 --> 30:54.688
- I had a marshmallow in my ear.

30:55.188 --> 30:56.898
I said…

30:56.981 --> 30:58.566
- <i>Orson believed in a world…</i>

30:58.650 --> 31:02.737
<i>…where the strong dominate the weak,</i>
<i>and that he should dominate all.</i>

31:04.114 --> 31:09.494
<i>And since I stood in his way,</i>
<i>he set a trap to get rid of me.</i>

31:23.675 --> 31:25.301
<i>We defeated Orson that day.</i>

31:27.137 --> 31:28.471
But at great cost.

31:33.309 --> 31:35.729
To keep the Lost World safe,
we banished Orson

31:35.812 --> 31:37.731
- to a place called Lava Island.

31:38.231 --> 31:40.608
- <i>And not the nice one.</i>

31:41.651 --> 31:44.154
<i>We thought a little alone time</i>
<i>would help Orson</i>

31:44.237 --> 31:45.697
<i>to have a change of heart,</i>

31:45.780 --> 31:47.866
<i>but his heart hardened even more</i>

31:47.949 --> 31:49.159
<i>and he became obsessed</i>

31:49.242 --> 31:50.702
- <i>with getting revenge.</i>

31:50.785 --> 31:52.871
- <i>We didn't know he'd have company.</i>

31:56.916 --> 31:58.376
<i>We're not sure how he survived</i>

31:58.460 --> 32:00.337
- <i>or what happened next.</i>

32:11.389 --> 32:13.308
Ooh.

32:15.518 --> 32:18.480
Ooh. You likey the fire?

32:18.980 --> 32:22.734
<i>All we know is that Orson</i>
<i>somehow escaped from Lava Island</i>

32:22.817 --> 32:25.236
<i>with a couple of raptors</i>
<i>under his command.</i>

32:30.075 --> 32:31.242
Sit.

32:32.702 --> 32:34.037
Stand.

32:36.247 --> 32:39.084
Bow to me.

32:43.213 --> 32:48.259
Ah, simpletons. All it takes
is a little fire to bend you to my will.

32:48.843 --> 32:52.138
The Lost World will finally be mine.

32:54.265 --> 32:56.393
<i>And he was free.</i>

32:57.018 --> 32:58.395
Ooh.

32:58.478 --> 32:59.604
And then what happened?

33:00.939 --> 33:03.650
Then you two showed up
and nearly got yourselves killed.

33:04.234 --> 33:05.735
Yay, we're in the story!

33:11.199 --> 33:13.368
Okay, boys. Lights out.

33:14.744 --> 33:17.664
Buck, can you tell us more
about the superhero team?

33:18.957 --> 33:21.918
Uh, nah.
That's a tale for another night.

33:23.962 --> 33:25.171
Whoa, whoa!

33:25.255 --> 33:26.339
- Shh!

34:09.049 --> 34:10.342
Shh!

34:49.422 --> 34:51.549
Oh, for crying out loud!

35:04.437 --> 35:05.730
What's that smell?

35:05.814 --> 35:08.650
Oh, yeah. Gas.

35:08.733 --> 35:09.776
Yours?

35:10.652 --> 35:12.737
Zee.

35:21.162 --> 35:22.539
Buck.

35:23.081 --> 35:24.332
Buck?

35:24.416 --> 35:25.583
- Buck?

35:25.667 --> 35:27.377
- Buck?

35:28.878 --> 35:31.256
The possums! The possums!

35:31.339 --> 35:33.341
Gas don't faze us, dude.

35:33.425 --> 35:34.968
We're used to things that stink.

35:38.680 --> 35:40.473
Looking for this?

35:50.108 --> 35:51.526
Wow.

35:51.609 --> 35:53.862
Zee, is that you?

35:54.362 --> 35:56.489
Well, someone had to save your butt.

36:00.702 --> 36:01.828
So I picked me.

36:01.911 --> 36:03.663
Wait. What about Bronwyn?

36:03.747 --> 36:05.999
She's safe. I left her with the cucumber.

36:06.082 --> 36:08.710
Good. The cucumber knows karate.

36:09.294 --> 36:12.922
Dude. Psst. You know Bronwyn's, like,
a pumpkin, right?

36:13.006 --> 36:16.051
Yeah. I also know Buck's got a cousin
who's a pine cone.

36:16.134 --> 36:17.552
Oh, right. Philip.

36:17.635 --> 36:20.263
Buck, who's your awesome skunk friend?

36:20.347 --> 36:23.391
I'm not a skunk, guys. I'm a zorilla.

36:23.475 --> 36:24.934
What's the difference?

36:25.518 --> 36:28.563
The difference is
I'm a mammal on a mission

36:29.064 --> 36:32.025
to bring equality
and justice to the Lost World.

36:32.859 --> 36:35.278
Also, skunks have slightly shorter tails.

36:35.362 --> 36:36.780
She's totally a skunk.

36:36.863 --> 36:39.491
A skunk with a secret identity!

36:39.574 --> 36:41.201
Cool.

36:41.284 --> 36:43.745
Well-- I-- Okay, yeah.

36:43.828 --> 36:46.873
- If that'll get you going, great.

36:46.956 --> 36:48.958
Come on, those boneheads are waking up.

36:49.042 --> 36:50.502
We'll follow you anywhere.

36:50.585 --> 36:53.380
Off a cliff, underwater,
into a volcano.

36:56.424 --> 36:57.884
I like your new friends.

36:59.678 --> 37:01.096
They make me feel smart.

37:01.179 --> 37:02.931
Don't worry.
What they lack in intelligence,

37:03.014 --> 37:05.433
they make up for in bumbling ineptitude.

37:06.726 --> 37:09.145
Buck, we have some unfinished business
to take care of.

37:09.229 --> 37:13.400
I mean, you know. Look. I know
we didn't always see eye to eye.

37:13.483 --> 37:15.944
Or, in my case, eyes to eye.

37:16.027 --> 37:21.199
Relax. I'm only here for one reason,
and it's bigger than you and me.

37:22.033 --> 37:27.163
If we don't stop Orson, he'll destroy
the harmony we fought so hard for.

37:27.831 --> 37:30.875
With him in charge,
the Lost World will be, well…

37:32.043 --> 37:33.461
lost.

37:33.545 --> 37:34.921
Oh.

37:35.505 --> 37:36.631
Right.

37:37.465 --> 37:40.135
And because then it will be
the "Lost Lost World,"

37:40.218 --> 37:42.345
which is both sad and confusing.

37:42.846 --> 37:45.056
Is the team getting back together again?

37:45.140 --> 37:46.474
You stay out of it, you!

37:46.558 --> 37:48.226
I thought you two stopped talking.

37:48.309 --> 37:49.936
We patched things up.

37:50.020 --> 37:52.981
And no, Lefty.
The team's not getting back together.

37:53.481 --> 37:55.859
Once we stop Orson, I'm outta here.

37:55.942 --> 37:57.610
That's a secret skunk for ya.

37:57.694 --> 37:59.821
They never stay in one place too long.

37:59.904 --> 38:02.032
Of course that glorious scent lingers.

38:13.043 --> 38:16.755
Hmm. No, no, no. My head's not that big.
This is not to scale at all.

38:17.922 --> 38:20.258
- I know you're there.
- I know you're there.

38:20.342 --> 38:22.719
- What have I said about copying, huh?

38:22.802 --> 38:26.014
Uh-uh-uh. Don't-- Don't--
Don't you-- Don't you dare.

38:26.514 --> 38:29.100
- Stop copying me!

38:31.144 --> 38:33.772
- Oh, I should have worked with birds.

38:33.855 --> 38:35.148
Huh?

38:38.735 --> 38:39.778
Huh.

38:39.861 --> 38:42.697
Clearly you two aren't nearly enough
to get the job done.

38:43.490 --> 38:46.534
Time to add to my posse.

38:46.618 --> 38:48.203
What I'm about to do next

38:48.286 --> 38:51.706
will destroy everything you've worked for,
Buckmeinster.

38:53.875 --> 38:55.710
- Get out of my face!

38:56.920 --> 38:59.214
How'd you know those raptors
were gonna attack?

38:59.297 --> 39:01.716
Unfortunately, Orson's been tracking you.

39:01.800 --> 39:04.052
Fortunately, I've been tracking Orson.

39:05.929 --> 39:08.640
Then, I guess it's up to you guys
to stop 'em.

39:08.723 --> 39:11.101
Two superheroes joining forces again!

39:11.184 --> 39:13.770
Buck Wild and Skunk-a-tor!

39:13.853 --> 39:16.314
I can't believe you told them
we were superheroes.

39:16.398 --> 39:19.359
I would never say that. They said it.

39:19.442 --> 39:21.611
Well, you two must have been a great team!

39:21.695 --> 39:24.656
Only when we agreed on things,
which was never.

39:24.739 --> 39:26.116
I agree with that.

39:26.199 --> 39:27.492
What's the problem, Buck?

39:27.575 --> 39:30.453
She's pretty cool
with that super spray of hers.

39:30.537 --> 39:32.414
Hey, what's your superpower anyway?

39:33.039 --> 39:36.543
Boys, what makes a superhero isn't powers.

39:39.212 --> 39:41.464
It's resourcefulness and courage.

39:41.965 --> 39:44.592
Yeah, that's what they always say
when they don't have any powers.

39:45.260 --> 39:47.012
Anyways, back to the plan.

39:47.554 --> 39:50.598
We have a control freak egomaniac
to catch up to.

39:50.682 --> 39:53.518
Yeah. And we've also gotta stop Orson.

39:59.107 --> 40:02.610
This is my worst-case scenario.
They're heading for the watering hole!

40:11.870 --> 40:16.875
Blimey. Orson's gonna serve his raptors
an all-you-can-eat mammal buffet.

40:20.670 --> 40:22.547
Okay, here's the plan.

40:23.340 --> 40:24.841
No time for a plan!

40:25.425 --> 40:28.094
There is always time for a pla--

40:28.178 --> 40:31.056
Okay, he can't hear me anymore.

40:37.187 --> 40:38.396
Whoa!

40:41.316 --> 40:42.317
Hey.

40:44.027 --> 40:47.364
- Everyone, we face a grave threat!

40:47.947 --> 40:49.908
- Are we out of fruity drinks again?

40:49.991 --> 40:53.078
We've gotta clear the area.
File out in an orderly fashion.

40:53.161 --> 40:56.831
- Two by two, one by three, five by nine.

41:05.590 --> 41:08.051
Nope, still can't fly.

41:14.933 --> 41:16.101
- No!

41:17.686 --> 41:19.604
- Go, go, go!

41:27.570 --> 41:30.657
It's time to get buck wild!

41:31.199 --> 41:32.200
Ow!

41:34.994 --> 41:36.246
What'd you do that for?

41:36.830 --> 41:37.872
Look!

41:45.630 --> 41:49.509
Buck! Oh, boy,
do I have a surprise for you.

41:50.301 --> 41:51.469
Behold!

41:58.226 --> 42:00.937
He's done it. He's built an army.

42:01.438 --> 42:03.857
I'm gonna RSVP "no" to this party.

42:04.357 --> 42:05.734
We need to get out of here.

42:21.666 --> 42:24.002
I'm coming for you, Bucky!

42:24.085 --> 42:26.921
And you won't weasel your way out
the next time.

42:27.505 --> 42:29.966
You can't protect
the mammals forever, Buck.

42:30.050 --> 42:33.720
My new raptor army
will eventually hunt you down.

42:34.304 --> 42:36.431
Now we really need a plan.

42:37.807 --> 42:42.562
We'll never defeat Orson if you keep going
all "buck wild" without thinking first.

42:42.645 --> 42:46.649
The more important question
is what does "Zee" stand for?

42:47.233 --> 42:50.236
Aw. You're cute.
Let's stay on track, shall we?

42:50.320 --> 42:52.864
We are completely outmatched.

42:52.947 --> 42:56.868
If we're gonna defeat Orson,
we're gonna need some big-time help.

42:56.951 --> 43:01.831
Hmm. Would you look at that?
I agree with Zee. We do need help.

43:01.915 --> 43:05.085
And there's only one creature
who can handle the job.

43:08.254 --> 43:13.009
Did you hear what he said? He said we!
He sees us as equals.

43:14.636 --> 43:16.179
Actually, I think he meant…

43:18.473 --> 43:20.642
total equals. You got it.

43:20.725 --> 43:23.353
Oh, and, uh, by the way, fellas,
the name thing?

43:23.436 --> 43:25.230
It's just Zee.

43:25.313 --> 43:27.857
- Yeah, I'm not buying it.

43:34.656 --> 43:36.783
My bone boat.

43:36.866 --> 43:39.494
Whoa! Buck's bone boat.

43:39.577 --> 43:41.371
I believe it's our bone boat.

43:41.454 --> 43:44.582
Whoa! Buck and Zee's bone boat.

43:45.208 --> 43:47.252
- I built it.
- I designed it.

43:47.335 --> 43:48.795
It didn't need a design.

43:51.673 --> 43:53.550
That's why the first boat sank.

43:53.633 --> 43:57.262
It didn't sink. The water rose.

43:57.345 --> 43:59.139
Do you sense some tension between them?

43:59.222 --> 44:00.223
Maybe a little.

44:18.533 --> 44:20.994
We'll reach Lost Lagoon by morning.

44:22.328 --> 44:23.621
You know what I'm wondering?

44:23.705 --> 44:26.791
Why we're going to Lost Lagoon
and who's gonna help us defeat Orson?

44:26.875 --> 44:29.544
No. I'm wondering
why my butt's stuck to the seat.

44:29.627 --> 44:30.628
Tree sap.

44:30.712 --> 44:32.172
You know what else I'm wondering?

44:32.255 --> 44:34.507
How could they have been
such a fierce team,

44:34.591 --> 44:36.009
but still not get along?

44:36.092 --> 44:38.928
I bet it's 'cause Zee never told him
what the "Zee" stood for.

44:39.012 --> 44:41.973
Okay, out with it. Is it Zeeva?

44:42.057 --> 44:43.558
- Zelda?
- Zeena?

44:43.641 --> 44:45.602
- Zsa Zsa?
- Zamantha.

44:45.685 --> 44:46.728
Zippy?

44:47.479 --> 44:49.397
I'm sorry. Did you just say Zippy?

44:49.481 --> 44:51.149
I told you it wasn't Zippy.

44:51.232 --> 44:54.235
Uh, once again,
Zee doesn't stand for anything.

44:54.319 --> 44:56.029
And that's not the reason.

44:56.112 --> 44:57.906
So what is the reason?

44:58.531 --> 45:02.285
- It's because he-- Never mind.
- It's because she-- Never mind.

45:02.827 --> 45:04.537
Let's work this out like family.

45:04.621 --> 45:07.248
Yeah, use your feeling words.

45:07.332 --> 45:08.625
I feel…

45:08.708 --> 45:10.543
I feel.

45:10.627 --> 45:15.131
Well, I feel Buck was stubborn
and reckless.

45:15.215 --> 45:18.385
Well, I feel Zee gets too hung up
on details.

45:18.468 --> 45:21.137
I also feel sad about my first boat.

45:21.221 --> 45:24.099
This is good.
I think we're getting somewhere.

45:24.182 --> 45:26.351
You're irresponsible, thickheaded.

45:26.434 --> 45:28.478
- You're demanding, and you're always…
- I'm tired of you…

45:28.561 --> 45:30.647
- …being mean to me.
- …always leaping before you look.

45:30.730 --> 45:33.483
- Recklessly hurling us into trouble.
- …but the rest of the team didn't.

45:33.566 --> 45:35.068
We needed to have a strategy.

45:35.151 --> 45:36.653
Your way didn't work!

45:36.736 --> 45:38.279
We lost our team.

45:39.739 --> 45:44.661
I know, Zee. But maybe there was nothing
we could do to save them.

45:45.245 --> 45:48.164
Maybe not, but you were my best friend.

45:49.040 --> 45:50.458
And I lost you too.

45:52.669 --> 45:54.421
Zee.

45:58.341 --> 46:00.218
I feel that could've gone better.

46:25.910 --> 46:27.996
Crash, I'm starting to think.

46:28.079 --> 46:30.081
Oh, no. Now you're doing it too.

46:30.623 --> 46:32.083
When we left the herd,

46:32.167 --> 46:35.503
we swore we'd become independent
and make our mark.

46:35.587 --> 46:38.048
- Yeah, but how?

46:38.131 --> 46:41.134
Buck needs some shut-eye
and we're nocturnal.

46:41.217 --> 46:45.055
This is our chance to prove ourselves.
Follow my lead.

46:46.431 --> 46:47.515
Hmm.

46:51.561 --> 46:54.272
Okay, Lost Lagoon is due south.

46:54.356 --> 46:55.940
We have to turn this boat around.

46:56.024 --> 46:57.901
You're holding the map upside down.

46:57.984 --> 46:59.402
Oh, well, in that case, we're good!

46:59.486 --> 47:01.529
- We're doing it! High five!

47:04.407 --> 47:07.118
Oh. When is tea ready, Mum?

47:26.262 --> 47:28.098
- Buck?
- Buck?

47:28.181 --> 47:29.391
Buck?

47:29.474 --> 47:31.893
Buck? Buck? Buck, Buck, Buck,

47:31.976 --> 47:34.270
Buck, Buck, Buck,
Buck, Buck, Buck, Buck, Buck,

47:34.354 --> 47:35.480
- Buck!

47:35.563 --> 47:36.690
Did I drift off?

47:37.273 --> 47:39.526
It's all good, Buck.
We kept the boat on track

47:39.609 --> 47:42.278
and made you a delicious a-breakfast.

47:42.362 --> 47:45.156
You got these from the trees?

47:45.240 --> 47:46.366
- Mmm.
- Mm-hmm.

47:46.449 --> 47:50.495
That's very nice,
but they're also very poisonous.

47:50.578 --> 47:53.415
From now on, keep your paws
and tails inside the boat.

47:53.498 --> 47:54.958
You don't know what's out there.

47:55.041 --> 47:57.961
Oh, so maybe we shouldn't have
snagged these jump ropes.

47:58.044 --> 47:59.796
- Uh.

47:59.879 --> 48:02.924
Guys, those are more poisonous
than the berries.

48:03.008 --> 48:04.551
- We're immune to snake venom.

48:04.634 --> 48:07.303
Yeah, but I'm not. It would kill me.

48:07.387 --> 48:10.598
It would make me break out
and then kill me.

48:10.682 --> 48:11.725
Our bad.

48:12.642 --> 48:13.893
Sorry, Zsa Zsa.

48:15.270 --> 48:18.523
Should we not have
adopted these cute pet lizards either?

48:23.153 --> 48:24.779
Maybe we're not ready to prove ourselves.

48:24.863 --> 48:26.906
Ha! Speak for yourself.

48:31.286 --> 48:32.996
Okay, you can speak for both of us.

48:47.802 --> 48:51.514
We've made it!
Time to summon an old friend.

49:08.823 --> 49:11.159
Crash, it's Mama T. rex!

49:11.242 --> 49:13.411
Wait, you know Mama T?

49:13.495 --> 49:16.206
Uh-huh. Our friend Sid
used to babysit her kids.

49:16.289 --> 49:18.667
She's gonna help us take out Orson.

49:18.750 --> 49:23.546
Well, that totally makes sense.
She's 15 tons of deadly, vicious terror!

49:24.297 --> 49:26.174
No offense, Mama.

49:29.386 --> 49:30.804
What's wrong, girl?

49:32.138 --> 49:36.017
Toothache, huh? Come on.
Let Dr. Buck take a look.

49:38.770 --> 49:44.275
Left upper incisor impacted.
Lower right molar missing.

49:44.901 --> 49:46.778
Ah! There's the bad tooth.

49:47.278 --> 49:49.322
Yeah, I've got to 86 the 23.

49:50.281 --> 49:53.326
That's what happens, young lady,
when you don't floss.

49:53.410 --> 49:55.203
Which is why we use our tails.

49:55.787 --> 49:58.915
Well, how can she help us defeat Orson
with a bad tooth?

49:58.998 --> 50:00.375
That is a good question.

50:00.458 --> 50:03.712
- I'm gonna need to pull it. Oi!

50:05.130 --> 50:10.635
Well, if you're not going to let me help,
I guess I'll have to just give up.

50:25.358 --> 50:27.777
Whoa! Respect.

50:33.241 --> 50:34.492
Hurry.

50:34.576 --> 50:36.453
I'm performing surgery here.

50:36.536 --> 50:40.123
If I let go, she'll surgically remove
your top from your bottom.

50:40.206 --> 50:41.583
Boy, it's really in there.

50:43.918 --> 50:46.379
Okay, Zee. All done. Time to wake her up.

50:46.463 --> 50:49.215
I just knock 'em out. I don't wake 'em up.

50:51.843 --> 50:53.511
Incoming! We've got raptors!

50:53.595 --> 50:55.764
Come on, boys! Let's get her up.

50:55.847 --> 50:57.515
We need to call in reinforcements.

50:57.599 --> 50:59.476
She is the reinforcements!

51:00.226 --> 51:01.936
Hello? Anyone home?

51:02.020 --> 51:04.064
You can sleep when you're dead!

51:04.147 --> 51:05.273
Why'd you knock her out?

51:05.357 --> 51:06.441
You told me to.

51:06.524 --> 51:07.901
- No, I didn't.
- You winked.

51:07.984 --> 51:10.653
I only have one eye.
Technically, that's a blink.

51:12.322 --> 51:15.241
- Nap time's over.
- What did you have, bricks for lunch?

51:16.576 --> 51:18.661
Well, here goes nothing.

51:20.080 --> 51:21.373
Heads up, buttercup.

51:22.749 --> 51:23.833
Go, go, go!

51:35.929 --> 51:38.014
Oh, you're pathetic, Buck.

51:38.098 --> 51:40.975
Did you really think reuniting with Zee

51:41.059 --> 51:45.021
and recruiting some T. rex
could help you defeat my army?

52:05.208 --> 52:07.210
Well, that was the idea. Yes.

52:07.293 --> 52:10.755
Evidently, I miscalculated,
but nobody's perfect.

52:10.839 --> 52:15.677
Except me, that is. I'm a genius
who's about to rule the Lost World.

52:15.760 --> 52:17.679
Over our dead bodies!

52:17.762 --> 52:22.809
My plan exactly. Soon everyone
will bow to me and call me king.

52:23.518 --> 52:24.936
Excuse me. Mm-hmm.

52:25.020 --> 52:27.480
I'm trying to do my evil here!

52:27.564 --> 52:29.566
I'm on a bit of a roll.

52:29.649 --> 52:32.444
But enough of this discourse.

52:32.527 --> 52:35.155
Let the feeding frenzy begin!

52:48.335 --> 52:49.586
Buck!

53:02.640 --> 53:04.768
Get away! Get away! Down!

53:06.728 --> 53:08.355
Spray 'em, Zee!

53:08.438 --> 53:11.858
I just sprayed!
I need time to refill, okay?

53:11.941 --> 53:13.985
Ooh! TMI, dude.

53:52.023 --> 53:54.776
Actually, Zee, it was all my fault.

53:55.276 --> 53:58.154
You're right.
We lost the team because of me.

53:58.238 --> 54:00.990
No, it was because of me.

54:01.074 --> 54:03.743
No, I insist I take the blame.

54:04.494 --> 54:06.955
Well, I insist you return the blame
and give it to me.

54:07.038 --> 54:10.583
Look, it wasn't you. It wasn't me.

54:12.168 --> 54:13.586
- It was us.
- It was us.

54:14.087 --> 54:17.048
If we really want harmony
in the Lost World,

54:17.132 --> 54:19.843
it has to start with you and me
working together.

54:29.769 --> 54:31.771
Get Mama and the possums to safety.

54:39.654 --> 54:40.989
Wha-- What's he doing?

54:41.072 --> 54:42.574
Giving us time to escape.

54:43.616 --> 54:45.660
Okay, brainiac.

54:46.161 --> 54:47.370
It's me you want.

54:47.871 --> 54:49.748
You got me.

54:50.915 --> 54:53.335
I win!

54:55.503 --> 54:57.464
Take him to the watering hole.

54:57.547 --> 55:01.509
There, I'll make an example of him
in front of all the other mammals.

55:01.593 --> 55:03.720
Whoa.

55:03.803 --> 55:05.555
Revenge is mine.

55:06.639 --> 55:08.850
Hey, great idea alert.

55:09.351 --> 55:12.228
Guess who had it? Me. Of course.

55:24.991 --> 55:26.785
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy now.

55:26.868 --> 55:29.245
Just get your strength back, Mama T.

55:29.329 --> 55:33.124
Orson's taking Buck back
to the watering hole. Meet us there.

56:54.205 --> 56:56.750
This is all our fault, Eddie.

56:57.250 --> 56:59.919
Buck said it was
a bad time for us to visit.

57:00.003 --> 57:02.380
Yeah, if he didn't have to
look out for us,

57:02.464 --> 57:04.174
maybe this never would have happened.

57:04.257 --> 57:06.217
I wish we could've done something
to help him.

57:06.801 --> 57:08.261
- Like what?
- I don't know.

57:08.803 --> 57:12.057
Something cool,
like master the power of lightning.

57:12.140 --> 57:14.976
Whoa! How awesome would that be?

57:15.060 --> 57:17.854
Crash and Eddie: Lightning Masters!

57:17.937 --> 57:22.317
Yeah, we'd be all zap this and zap that.
And zap the first thing again.

57:23.276 --> 57:24.736
Ah, face it, bro.

57:24.819 --> 57:28.198
We're never gonna be lightning masters,
or make our mark.

57:28.281 --> 57:30.075
Or pretty much do anything.

57:30.700 --> 57:32.494
Ellie was right about us.

57:32.577 --> 57:34.621
We're not ready to be on our own.

57:36.998 --> 57:40.085
Is this what Buck would do? Give up? Sulk?

57:40.168 --> 57:41.920
But we let him down.

57:42.003 --> 57:45.131
Which means it's time to buck up.

57:45.215 --> 57:47.300
You mean rush in without thinking?

57:48.760 --> 57:50.595
Yeah, well, he would do that.

57:50.679 --> 57:54.265
I, however, wouldn't have left
without a plan to rescue him.

57:54.808 --> 57:56.601
But I'm gonna need your help.

57:56.685 --> 57:58.645
We could if we had a superpower.

57:59.896 --> 58:01.690
Remember what Buck taught you.

58:01.773 --> 58:04.275
It's not powers that make you a superhero.

58:05.276 --> 58:07.153
It's courage.

58:07.237 --> 58:08.863
And resourcefulness.

58:10.740 --> 58:12.701
Maybe that's our problem, Crash.

58:12.784 --> 58:15.870
Whenever we're in trouble,
all we do is play dead.

58:15.954 --> 58:17.622
Well, it is our go-to move.

58:17.706 --> 58:20.500
Yeah, but it's kinda
the opposite of courage.

58:21.084 --> 58:22.544
Yeah, I see that.

58:23.044 --> 58:25.213
But where can we get courage?

58:25.296 --> 58:26.798
You already have it…

58:27.799 --> 58:28.883
right here.

58:29.384 --> 58:30.969
In our chest fur?

58:31.636 --> 58:33.930
She means our spleens.

58:34.014 --> 58:35.181
Yeah!

58:35.265 --> 58:39.728
If we can harness the power
of our spleens, we can master lightning!

58:45.066 --> 58:46.735
We're here on Raptor River.

58:47.235 --> 58:49.904
Orson's got Buck
here at the watering hole.

58:49.988 --> 58:51.781
We'll launch a surprise attack.

58:51.865 --> 58:54.659
Like a surprise party with weapons.

58:55.452 --> 58:58.913
Mmm… I dunno, Zee,
or whatever your real name is.

58:58.997 --> 59:02.334
The three of us
against Orson's whole army?

59:02.417 --> 59:03.418
Hey!

59:03.501 --> 59:05.712
You would be surprised
what we're capable of.

59:06.379 --> 59:09.049
I just wish we knew
how Orson controls the raptors.

59:09.132 --> 59:12.802
Maybe he gives them treats.
I know I'd do anything for a marshmallow.

59:12.886 --> 59:14.262
Would you marry a frog?

59:14.346 --> 59:16.306
- What kind of frog?
- Focus, guys.

59:16.389 --> 59:18.141
It's time to train for the mission.

59:37.827 --> 59:39.120
Ha, ha, ha!

59:45.710 --> 59:46.711
Whoa.

59:53.885 --> 59:57.138
Oh. Right in the possum parts.

1:00:20.328 --> 1:00:21.746
- Yeah!
- Ha, ha!

1:00:39.264 --> 1:00:42.308
Face it, guys.
Crash and Eddie have gone bye-bye.

1:00:42.392 --> 1:00:45.061
They totally disappeared without a trace!

1:00:46.271 --> 1:00:47.522
I got footprints.

1:00:48.898 --> 1:00:51.568
All that means is their feet
were around here.

1:00:52.944 --> 1:00:55.155
Thank goodness. We're back on their trail.

1:00:55.238 --> 1:00:57.407
It looks like their trail leads to a--

1:00:58.074 --> 1:01:02.078
Oh, no! Those ding-dongs
went back to the Lost World!

1:01:02.162 --> 1:01:04.998
Oh. And I thought I made bad choices.

1:01:24.017 --> 1:01:27.687
We're in luck!
Orson's raptors got smaller.

1:01:27.771 --> 1:01:29.147
Ha! They're tiny.

1:01:29.230 --> 1:01:33.109
I say we crush them like ants,
then shoot hoops at the watering hole.

1:01:33.193 --> 1:01:35.904
Guys, they're not tiny.
They're just far away.

1:01:36.696 --> 1:01:39.908
Oh. Well, in that case,
we're in huge trouble.

1:01:44.371 --> 1:01:45.413
Remember.

1:01:51.795 --> 1:01:53.129
It's time to get…

1:01:54.130 --> 1:01:55.423
Buck wild!

1:02:00.095 --> 1:02:02.681
The entrance is blocked.
Do you think they got through?

1:02:02.764 --> 1:02:04.724
Only one way to find out.

1:02:14.609 --> 1:02:16.695
Come on.

1:02:27.664 --> 1:02:32.460
Whew! Those upper body workouts
really paid off.

1:02:32.544 --> 1:02:34.546
Come on! We need to find Buck.

1:02:34.629 --> 1:02:36.381
He's their only hope down here.

1:02:36.464 --> 1:02:37.882
Oh, great.

1:02:37.966 --> 1:02:41.678
Their lives may depend on
an unstable weasel who talks to his hand.

1:02:51.104 --> 1:02:52.397
Sid!

1:02:55.316 --> 1:02:56.484
Run!

1:03:03.033 --> 1:03:04.034
Whoa!

1:03:04.117 --> 1:03:05.577
- Ha!
- Oh!

1:03:08.538 --> 1:03:09.789
Ow…

1:03:09.873 --> 1:03:12.250
- Huh?

1:03:18.840 --> 1:03:20.175
Mama!

1:03:22.260 --> 1:03:23.553
What's that, you say?

1:03:25.180 --> 1:03:26.639
The watering hole?

1:03:28.808 --> 1:03:31.853
Oh, no! Crash and Eddie are in trouble.

1:03:31.936 --> 1:03:34.022
You say that like it's news.

1:03:42.572 --> 1:03:44.282
This is farewell, Buck.

1:03:44.366 --> 1:03:48.828
Time to turn you into a chew toy
for my ravenous friends here.

1:03:49.621 --> 1:03:51.331
You'll never get away with this.

1:03:51.414 --> 1:03:53.708
There's no way I'm letting
my pumpkin daughter

1:03:53.792 --> 1:03:55.126
grow up without a father.

1:03:55.710 --> 1:03:57.253
What? Okay, I'm done.

1:03:57.337 --> 1:04:02.133
Dinner is served,
compliments of King Orson.

1:04:02.217 --> 1:04:03.677
Ooh, I like the sound of that.

1:04:17.148 --> 1:04:19.067
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yeah!

1:04:19.150 --> 1:04:21.361
Huh?

1:04:21.444 --> 1:04:23.363
Ooh! Morons!

1:04:23.446 --> 1:04:25.615
Good work, fellas!

1:04:25.699 --> 1:04:27.075
Get skunked!

1:04:27.158 --> 1:04:28.326
Yeah!

1:04:29.202 --> 1:04:30.328
Hi-yah!

1:04:38.128 --> 1:04:41.589
I love the smell of skunky gas
in the morning.

1:04:41.673 --> 1:04:43.633
- Whoo!

1:04:50.056 --> 1:04:52.851
Bye-bye, Bucky.

1:05:02.402 --> 1:05:04.696
Yeah!

1:05:10.201 --> 1:05:14.706
Hang on, Crash and Eddie.
Here comes the T. rex express!

1:05:20.295 --> 1:05:21.588
Buck!

1:05:22.255 --> 1:05:23.423
Hey-ya!

1:05:35.185 --> 1:05:36.436
Whoo!

1:05:38.813 --> 1:05:39.981
Whoa!

1:05:43.651 --> 1:05:46.279
You took a big chance
giving yourself up back there.

1:05:46.363 --> 1:05:48.573
That's what you do in a herd.

1:05:48.656 --> 1:05:52.285
Besides, I knew you'd be the one
to come and rescue me.

1:05:52.869 --> 1:05:57.290
So, what now?
I'm sure you have something in mind.

1:05:57.374 --> 1:05:59.542
How about we make it up as we go along?

1:05:59.626 --> 1:06:01.961
Now, that's what I call a plan.

1:06:08.843 --> 1:06:11.388
- Whee-hee-hee-hoo!
- Oh, yeah!

1:06:14.808 --> 1:06:17.227
- Whoa!

1:06:19.646 --> 1:06:22.774
Okay, I'm confused. What just happened?

1:06:22.857 --> 1:06:26.027
I believe Crash and Eddie
just kicked some serious butt.

1:06:32.867 --> 1:06:35.787
- Yeah!
- All right, Mama!

1:06:36.287 --> 1:06:37.622
Wait for me, guys!

1:06:48.633 --> 1:06:49.676
Yes!

1:07:00.395 --> 1:07:03.606
You've been nothing but
a thorn in my side from the start.

1:07:03.690 --> 1:07:06.234
You just never got it, Orson.

1:07:06.317 --> 1:07:09.154
The Lost World
isn't meant to be ruled by anyone.

1:07:09.237 --> 1:07:12.532
Not just anyone. Me!

1:07:13.658 --> 1:07:14.743
<i>En garde!</i>

1:07:24.210 --> 1:07:26.087
All right, who wants some?

1:07:26.171 --> 1:07:27.505
Take this!

1:07:28.173 --> 1:07:30.091
And that! Huh?

1:07:30.884 --> 1:07:34.054
Time to get a little less mammoth
and a little more possum.

1:07:37.140 --> 1:07:40.352
All right!

1:07:42.937 --> 1:07:44.814
Back off. He's family.

1:07:44.898 --> 1:07:47.150
Besides, he's high in saturated fats.

1:07:47.233 --> 1:07:50.653
Look, the truth is we all need each other.

1:07:54.741 --> 1:07:57.827
Down here, all creatures,
mammals and dinos alike,

1:07:58.370 --> 1:08:00.080
we need to live in harmony.

1:08:00.580 --> 1:08:02.999
Oh, you are so naive.

1:08:03.083 --> 1:08:05.335
This is why I feel sorry for you, Buck.

1:08:05.418 --> 1:08:06.920
You're too idealistic.

1:08:07.003 --> 1:08:11.299
In the real world, it's survival
of the fittest, or should I say smartest.

1:08:21.601 --> 1:08:23.603
Oh! Nailed it.

1:08:29.526 --> 1:08:31.277
Oh, no.

1:08:36.616 --> 1:08:37.659
Sic 'em.

1:08:37.742 --> 1:08:38.743
Alley-oop!

1:08:41.037 --> 1:08:42.163
Stay! Down, boy.

1:08:42.247 --> 1:08:44.541
Bad dinos. No bite! No bite!

1:08:44.624 --> 1:08:46.084
Ha, <i>croissant!</i>

1:08:48.545 --> 1:08:50.088
- <i>Baguette!</i>

1:08:50.171 --> 1:08:51.464
- <i>Fromage!</i>

1:08:52.007 --> 1:08:53.717
Looks like you got me, Bucky.

1:08:54.551 --> 1:08:57.012
Or do you?

1:08:57.095 --> 1:08:59.639
Seems I've outsmarted you once again.

1:08:59.723 --> 1:09:02.517
They're gonna tear
your little friends to pieces,

1:09:02.600 --> 1:09:05.311
and then they're gonna come for you.

1:09:05.395 --> 1:09:07.480
Watch this, Buckmeinster.

1:09:08.648 --> 1:09:09.858
It's showtime.

1:09:13.862 --> 1:09:15.113
It's the fire!

1:09:15.196 --> 1:09:17.490
That's how he gets them
to follow his every move.

1:09:17.574 --> 1:09:21.327
Remember what Zee said?
The answer is in our chest fur.

1:09:37.093 --> 1:09:40.722
Three. Two. One. Play dead.

1:09:47.604 --> 1:09:50.857
Oh, come on, guys.
We're not falling for that.

1:09:50.940 --> 1:09:53.193
We didn't fall for it the first time.

1:10:02.494 --> 1:10:04.829
What? You imbeciles.

1:10:04.913 --> 1:10:07.290
You're raptors, not possums. Get up!

1:10:08.416 --> 1:10:10.126
- Oh, yeah!
- Whoo-hoo!

1:10:10.210 --> 1:10:11.670
Yeah!

1:10:11.753 --> 1:10:13.838
- Those are my boys!
- Whoo!

1:10:13.922 --> 1:10:16.007
Yes! Well done, lads!

1:10:16.091 --> 1:10:18.259
That's called using your spleens!

1:10:18.343 --> 1:10:22.389
Ha, what do you know, Eddie?
We do have a superpower.

1:10:22.472 --> 1:10:24.224
- Yeah!
- Playing dead!

1:10:24.307 --> 1:10:25.642
What?

1:10:25.725 --> 1:10:28.436
Looks like you've been outsmarted.

1:10:28.520 --> 1:10:30.814
No, no, no, no, no, no, no--

1:10:43.743 --> 1:10:46.037
Uh… I'm okay!

1:10:46.913 --> 1:10:48.123
Think again.

1:10:48.748 --> 1:10:50.875
- Payback time.
- Oh, yeah.

1:10:52.794 --> 1:10:55.005
Where's your chew toy? Go get him.

1:10:57.132 --> 1:11:01.011
What? I don't know
if you got the memo. I'm your king.

1:11:01.094 --> 1:11:03.179
I command you--

1:11:03.263 --> 1:11:05.682
Oh, whoa! That was close.
Hey, please don't eat me.

1:11:05.765 --> 1:11:08.059
You'll be depriving the world
of a great genius.

1:11:08.143 --> 1:11:11.021
I'm full of tiny bones
that'll get stuck in your throat.

1:11:11.521 --> 1:11:13.940
What have I told you about boundaries?

1:11:16.776 --> 1:11:19.154
Boys, that was a fine job.

1:11:19.654 --> 1:11:22.574
Better than fine.
I'd say super, even.

1:11:22.657 --> 1:11:25.160
You made this old weasel proud.

1:11:25.243 --> 1:11:26.578
Who are you calling old?

1:11:26.661 --> 1:11:29.456
- Crash! Eddie!

1:11:35.086 --> 1:11:36.212
- Ellie!
- Ellie!

1:11:41.301 --> 1:11:42.552
We're so sorry.

1:11:42.635 --> 1:11:44.346
We shouldn't have left
without saying goodbye.

1:11:44.429 --> 1:11:46.056
You came all the way down here to find us.

1:11:46.139 --> 1:11:47.223
You put yourself in danger.

1:11:47.307 --> 1:11:49.017
You didn't think
we could take care of ourselves.

1:11:49.100 --> 1:11:50.852
With good reason.
And you worried about us.

1:11:50.935 --> 1:11:52.562
'Cause you really care about us.

1:11:52.645 --> 1:11:56.566
Boys, boys, slow down.
I'm the one who should be sorry.

1:11:57.067 --> 1:12:00.820
I was scared of losing you.
I love you guys.

1:12:01.529 --> 1:12:02.906
We love you too.

1:12:03.490 --> 1:12:04.699
Hey.

1:12:06.284 --> 1:12:08.119
You guys actually did it.

1:12:08.620 --> 1:12:09.913
I'm proud of you.

1:12:11.164 --> 1:12:12.499
I never doubted them.

1:12:14.626 --> 1:12:16.252
Okay, I doubted them a little.

1:12:16.336 --> 1:12:18.463
Boys, I didn't know you had it in you.

1:12:18.546 --> 1:12:20.924
Mostly because you act like
total dimwits all the time.

1:12:21.007 --> 1:12:24.177
Aw. I love family reunions.

1:12:24.260 --> 1:12:27.806
But there's no buffet,
so time to head home.

1:12:27.889 --> 1:12:30.600
- About that--
- Hello, mates.

1:12:30.684 --> 1:12:34.020
This is Zee. She's a very dear friend.

1:12:34.104 --> 1:12:36.272
It's nice to meet you, Zee.

1:12:36.356 --> 1:12:40.443
The way you took charge out there,
I'd swear you were part possum.

1:12:40.527 --> 1:12:42.570
Actually, she's a zorilla.

1:12:42.654 --> 1:12:44.948
It's like a skunk, only cooler.

1:12:45.031 --> 1:12:48.451
And my name may or may not be Zsa Zsa.

1:12:51.705 --> 1:12:54.958
We were lucky to have possums
join our superhero squad.

1:12:55.041 --> 1:12:57.210
Really? A superhero squad?

1:12:57.293 --> 1:12:58.962
She said it. I didn't.

1:12:59.045 --> 1:13:01.172
You're probably gonna want our autographs.

1:13:01.256 --> 1:13:02.465
- No thanks.
- I'm good.

1:13:02.549 --> 1:13:05.218
Well, now that you've had
your big adventure,

1:13:05.301 --> 1:13:07.846
I suppose you'll be heading back home.

1:13:08.805 --> 1:13:11.558
After all,
you're probably bored of old Buck

1:13:11.641 --> 1:13:14.853
and his daring, action-packed,
thrill-a-minute lifestyle.

1:13:15.854 --> 1:13:18.273
Uh…Yeah.

1:13:18.356 --> 1:13:22.152
Yeah, I am. Boring. Just so, so bored.

1:13:22.235 --> 1:13:23.820
Total snoozefest.

1:13:28.241 --> 1:13:33.580
Actually, the truth is,
Eddie and I have been thinking…

1:13:33.663 --> 1:13:36.249
Which we're slowly getting better at.

1:13:36.332 --> 1:13:38.209
Uh… Yeah.

1:13:39.836 --> 1:13:43.548
The thing is,
we kinda, sorta like it here.

1:13:47.886 --> 1:13:49.137
Eddie, you talk now.

1:13:51.890 --> 1:13:56.603
We wanna stay down here,
but we wanna know that you'll be okay.

1:13:59.147 --> 1:14:02.442
It seems like it was just yesterday
we were kids.

1:14:03.068 --> 1:14:05.153
I thought we'd always be together.

1:14:05.904 --> 1:14:07.906
Are you sure it's what you want?

1:14:12.285 --> 1:14:14.079
Then I'll be fine.

1:14:17.832 --> 1:14:20.126
We're staying!

1:14:20.210 --> 1:14:22.962
Oh, magic!

1:14:23.046 --> 1:14:25.298
I've been a loner for too long.

1:14:25.382 --> 1:14:28.718
Zee made me realize
we're all stronger together than apart.

1:14:29.344 --> 1:14:32.138
It's time for me to have a real family.

1:14:32.222 --> 1:14:34.974
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!
- Oh, yeah.

1:14:35.058 --> 1:14:36.935
- Go, Buck.
- Go, Buck.

1:14:37.018 --> 1:14:39.104
- Go, Buck.
- Go, Buck. Yeah.

1:14:39.187 --> 1:14:40.522
Buck, Buck, Buck!

1:14:40.605 --> 1:14:44.943
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I'm gonna miss you guys.

1:14:45.026 --> 1:14:47.028
Yeah, we'll miss you guys too.

1:14:48.029 --> 1:14:51.574
Yeah, okay. Enough of this lovefest.

1:14:52.117 --> 1:14:54.619
Is that a tear in your eye, Diego?

1:14:54.703 --> 1:14:56.538
No. And it never happened.

1:14:56.621 --> 1:14:58.748
Look at you. You're such a softy.

1:15:40.081 --> 1:15:42.292
Promise me you'll visit all the time.

1:15:42.792 --> 1:15:43.918
We will.

1:15:44.836 --> 1:15:46.546
Especially when we need something.

1:16:13.323 --> 1:16:17.285
<i>Change is scary,</i>
<i>but it is the way of the world.</i>

1:16:17.369 --> 1:16:21.956
<i>And now I realize it can help us grow</i>
<i>into who we're meant to be,</i>

1:16:22.040 --> 1:16:24.584
<i>even if that takes us to new places.</i>

1:16:25.085 --> 1:16:29.089
<i>The only thing that stays the same</i>
<i>is the love we have for each other.</i>

1:16:29.839 --> 1:16:31.800
<i>That's the thing about a herd.</i>

1:16:31.883 --> 1:16:35.136
<i>You're a part of it,</i>
<i>even when you're apart.</i>

1:16:39.265 --> 1:16:40.642
Can you believe it?

1:16:41.184 --> 1:16:42.852
- The boys are back.

1:16:42.936 --> 1:16:43.978
Again.

1:16:44.562 --> 1:16:46.064
And they want lunch.

1:17:42.996 --> 1:17:45.457
Well, one thing's for certain.

1:17:45.540 --> 1:17:46.916
With those two around…

1:17:47.000 --> 1:17:49.627
…the Lost World
will never be the same.

1:17:49.711 --> 1:17:50.712
Ha, ha, ho!
