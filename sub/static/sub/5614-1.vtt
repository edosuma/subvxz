Don't forget about tonight, sleepyhead.

01:41.680 --> 01:43.045
See you later.

(SIGHS)

01:45.240 --> 01:46.366
Do we have to go?

01:46.720 --> 01:48.722
Yes, we do.

01:50.040 --> 01:51.860
Mmm. I love you, babe.

01:51.960 --> 01:53.220
Why don't you come on back to bed?

01:53.320 --> 01:56.085
Don't tempt me. I'm already late.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

02:01.240 --> 02:03.561
- Hello?
- Leah, it's Tom.

02:03.920 --> 02:05.445
You're worried about Wharton.

02:05.560 --> 02:08.539
TOM: Well, I wasn't until Alan
called me at 6:00 a.m. this morning.

02:08.639 --> 02:09.860
They don't think we have the votes.

02:09.960 --> 02:11.460
LEAH: Tom, I've got this.

02:11.560 --> 02:13.540
I have a scheduled call
with the senator at 9:30

02:13.640 --> 02:15.780
and she made it very clear
that she could turn this.

02:15.880 --> 02:18.020
Yeah, I'm nervous.
It's a big account for us.

02:18.120 --> 02:19.780
LEAH: Have I ever let you down?

02:19.880 --> 02:21.260
Speak to me after the call.

02:21.360 --> 02:22.691
Okay.

02:28.520 --> 02:29.965
CASHIER: Can I help you?

02:32.840 --> 02:33.841
Can I help you?

02:35.200 --> 02:37.460
- Hi.
- Oh, um... (CHUCKLES)

02:37.560 --> 02:38.860
I'm sorry.

02:38.960 --> 02:40.724
I'll have a, um...

02:42.320 --> 02:43.526
Iced latte.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.300
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

02:45.400 --> 02:47.402
Okay. That'll be $2.75.

02:48.200 --> 02:49.326
Thanks.

BARISTA: I've got an iced latte.

02:52.960 --> 02:53.940
Who was here first?

02:54.040 --> 02:55.780
- You take it.
- No, you were here first.

02:55.880 --> 02:58.340
No. No, it's all right. You look like
you're in a rush, and I can wait.

02:58.440 --> 03:00.090
So, please.

03:00.840 --> 03:02.780
- That's so sweet.
- My pleasure.

03:02.880 --> 03:04.120
Thank you.

03:20.120 --> 03:21.860
Okay. Can I get a little respect, here?

I'm about to make a fool out of myself.

(CROWD CHUCKLE)

03:24.640 --> 03:27.405
Karen and I have been together now

(ALL CHEERING)

03:31.520 --> 03:32.740
Karen, I adore you.

03:32.840 --> 03:37.300
And I just hope that the next 10 years
are as amazing as these past 10 have been.

KAREN: Oh, is that right?

03:52.160 --> 03:53.660
- Hi.
- Hey, buddy.

03:53.760 --> 03:55.420
You look funny upside-down.

03:55.520 --> 03:58.171
- Then why aren't you laughing? Huh? Huh?
- (GIGGLING)

03:58.600 --> 03:59.780
How come you're laughing?
Let me hear it.

03:59.880 --> 04:01.780

- There it is! There it is.

04:01.880 --> 04:05.566
KAREN: Okay, mister,
it is way past your bedtime.

04:05.880 --> 04:07.060
Say good night to everybody.

04:07.160 --> 04:09.980
- Good night to everybody!
- Very funny.

04:10.080 --> 04:11.500
- Up top on the way out, buddy.
- ZACH: Okay.

04:11.600 --> 04:13.568
- All right.

- You're a natural.
- DAVE: Really?

04:16.640 --> 04:18.244
- How's that?
- With kids.

04:18.360 --> 04:19.579
DAVE: Oh, yeah. No, I love kids.

04:19.680 --> 04:21.459
Especially when you get to play
with them a little bit,

04:21.560 --> 04:23.420
then give them back to their parents
to take them home.

04:23.520 --> 04:25.568
ALICIA: Well, I can tell.
You're gonna make a good father.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.205
That was a beautiful party.

04:35.960 --> 04:37.200
Mmm-hmm.

(SIGHS)

04:40.440 --> 04:41.680
What's up? You good?

04:41.800 --> 04:43.165
I'm fine.

04:53.800 --> 04:55.802
(DAVE SIGHING)

05:00.880 --> 05:03.042
It's not gonna happen, is it?

05:04.560 --> 05:05.940
Now, we've already been
through this, babe.

05:06.040 --> 05:09.460
Exactly. We have been through this
and nothing seems to change.

05:09.560 --> 05:14.248
Well, we also agreed that we weren't gonna
talk about this anymore, remember?

05:14.840 --> 05:19.687
When I looked over at you being
so good with that little boy, it just...

05:21.280 --> 05:22.540
Because I know you don't want that.

05:22.640 --> 05:24.900
No, no. I never said
that I didn't want that.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.049
I'm just... I'm just not ready.

05:30.400 --> 05:33.180
We've been dating for almost two years.

05:33.280 --> 05:35.931
Yes, and it's been
a wonderful two years.

05:36.200 --> 05:37.247
I don't want to lose you.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.660
I don't either.

05:39.760 --> 05:41.285
But I do want a family.

05:41.400 --> 05:42.380
I know that!

05:42.480 --> 05:43.460
Now, come on. You know my parents.

05:43.560 --> 05:45.164
They hated each other
when they were together.

05:45.280 --> 05:47.681
When they split,
it was a relief for everybody.

05:48.040 --> 05:51.567
Both of my brothers divorced,
my sister divorced.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.740
That's two within the last year, okay?

05:53.840 --> 05:56.491
Joe, he can't even stand
the sight of his ex.

05:59.360 --> 06:01.249
And I don't want that.

06:02.880 --> 06:05.645
I don't want to
wake up one morning hating you.

06:06.920 --> 06:08.420
I'm 36 years old.

06:08.520 --> 06:10.260
I've been dating my whole life.

06:10.360 --> 06:12.340
I'm dated out!

06:12.440 --> 06:14.727
I don't want to do it anymore.

06:15.320 --> 06:17.368
I want a husband

06:17.480 --> 06:18.740
and children.

06:18.840 --> 06:22.049
While, while I'm still
young enough to enjoy them.

06:23.640 --> 06:25.130
I can't do it like this.

06:26.640 --> 06:28.020
I can't.

06:28.120 --> 06:31.460
I want to propose to you
when I'm ready to propose.

06:31.560 --> 06:35.326
Not because you feel the need for me to do it
right here, right now, at this moment.

06:35.960 --> 06:37.740
I don't want to do it like that.

06:37.840 --> 06:39.490
I'm sorry.

06:43.320 --> 06:44.970
I can't wait for you anymore.

06:47.640 --> 06:48.846
So, what are you saying?

06:50.000 --> 06:51.889
I think maybe you should go.

07:02.680 --> 07:03.740
(SNIFFLING)

07:03.840 --> 07:05.524
Yeah, maybe I should.

07:29.800 --> 07:32.041
(GASPS) Jesus, Tom, you scared me.

07:32.560 --> 07:34.220
I didn't know anyone else was here.

07:34.320 --> 07:38.100
I had dinner with a client and realized
I left my phone in my office.

07:38.200 --> 07:39.804
That the report?

07:40.200 --> 07:41.700
All 500 pages of it.

07:41.800 --> 07:42.860
Will it pass the committee?

07:42.960 --> 07:45.201
I'll let you know in 300 pages.

07:45.560 --> 07:46.780
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

07:46.880 --> 07:47.980
All right, don't work too hard.

07:48.080 --> 07:49.660
If only you meant that.

07:49.760 --> 07:51.171
I'm serious.

07:51.280 --> 07:52.620
It's late!

07:52.720 --> 07:55.041
Just pick it up tomorrow.
Go home to your boyfriend.

07:55.160 --> 07:58.060
Well, we actually broke up
a couple of months ago.

07:58.160 --> 08:00.540
Oh, I'm sorry. I... I didn't know.

08:00.640 --> 08:02.500
No, it's, it's fine.

08:02.600 --> 08:05.300
It's better to catch
these things early, right?

08:05.400 --> 08:06.526
Maybe.

08:07.280 --> 08:09.931
My grandfather had a saying.

08:10.520 --> 08:13.460
"Life is like a coin.

08:13.560 --> 08:17.770
"You can spend it on anything you want,
but you can only spend it once."

08:19.960 --> 08:21.325
- I don't know.
- (LAUGHS)

08:22.320 --> 08:24.243
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

08:25.440 --> 08:27.169
- Night.
- Night.

08:33.960 --> 08:36.419
- HOSTESS: Yes?
- LEAH: I'm meeting Karen Hillard.

08:36.520 --> 08:39.100
Looks like you're the first to arrive.
Would you like to wait at the bar?

08:39.200 --> 08:40.419
Hi. What can I get for you?

08:40.520 --> 08:42.760
- Ketel One martini.
- You got it.

08:50.440 --> 08:54.161
I want three reasons
why I shouldn't buy you a drink.

08:54.560 --> 08:56.881
Well, here's one reason.

08:57.360 --> 08:59.180
I already have one.

08:59.280 --> 09:00.725
But thanks.

09:01.200 --> 09:03.220
(CHUCKLES) I like you. You're funny.

09:03.320 --> 09:07.405
Wait a minute. I said wait!

09:09.360 --> 09:10.740
Three reasons.

09:10.840 --> 09:13.420
- Okay, two.
- Two.

09:13.520 --> 09:15.204
I'm waiting for someone.

09:15.800 --> 09:17.300
So...

09:17.400 --> 09:19.562
And three, please refer to two.

09:22.160 --> 09:24.420
- Boyfriend?
- As a matter of fact, yes.

09:24.520 --> 09:27.500
And if he finds me talking to you,
he's not gonna be too happy.

09:27.600 --> 09:30.820
Mmm. Well then,
we better get out of here quickly.

09:30.920 --> 09:33.400
- What?
- I think you know what I'm talking about.

09:33.760 --> 09:35.524
CARTER: You been waiting long?

09:37.880 --> 09:39.620
Uh, yeah.

09:39.720 --> 09:40.980
CARTER: I'm sorry I'm late.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.286
You look beautiful.

09:48.120 --> 09:49.690
Why are you still standing here?

09:51.120 --> 09:52.060
Excuse me?

09:52.160 --> 09:54.561
I said, why are you still standing here?

09:55.680 --> 09:56.886
Walk away.

09:59.360 --> 10:01.124
(EXHALES) Whatever.

10:05.280 --> 10:06.420
CARTER: Hope you don't mind.

10:06.520 --> 10:08.900
I looked over and it looked like
you needed a little help.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.220
Thank you.

10:10.320 --> 10:11.420
Looks like problem solved,
so I'll leave you...

10:11.520 --> 10:13.284
Coffee shop. Right?

10:13.480 --> 10:14.460
Good memory.

10:14.560 --> 10:16.722
Well, now you have to let me
buy you a drink.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.440
We were just about to leave.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.260
We're just here for work drinks.

10:21.360 --> 10:22.420
Oh.

10:22.520 --> 10:23.760
Oh, okay.

10:25.280 --> 10:27.282
But I'm twice in your debt.

10:31.640 --> 10:32.860
So...

10:32.960 --> 10:35.088
- Leah Vaughn.
- Yes?

10:35.920 --> 10:37.340
No man in your life?

10:37.440 --> 10:38.805
Not anymore.

10:40.920 --> 10:41.967
What happened?

10:43.880 --> 10:45.484
What happened?

10:45.880 --> 10:46.881
Mmm.

10:48.720 --> 10:53.089
I... I guess we just wanted
different things.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.604
Shouldn't be so hard.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.844
You're right.

11:02.920 --> 11:04.604
It shouldn't be.

11:09.160 --> 11:10.241
CARTER: It's simple.

11:19.600 --> 11:21.090
Is it?

11:25.720 --> 11:27.140
CARTER: A lobbyist, huh?

11:27.240 --> 11:30.340
I guess you're well-practiced
in the art of persuasion.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.249
I've been known to get my way.

11:32.720 --> 11:34.660
Enough about me. What...

11:34.760 --> 11:36.140
Tell me about what you do.

11:36.240 --> 11:39.289
I specialize in corporate espionage
and network protection.

11:40.080 --> 11:44.020
I get a lot of satisfaction out of
making sure people feel secure

11:44.120 --> 11:45.645
and safe.

11:46.960 --> 11:48.740
I can see you'd be good at that.

11:48.840 --> 11:49.940
Thank you.

11:50.040 --> 11:51.246
(CHUCKLES)

11:55.240 --> 11:56.651
No pressure.

11:57.720 --> 11:59.768
But if you want to call...

12:01.520 --> 12:04.171
What happened to "just one night?"

12:07.080 --> 12:10.084
I didn't know
it was gonna be a night like this.

12:24.080 --> 12:25.491
Good night.

12:28.680 --> 12:30.170
Good night.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.260
(EXHALES)

12:47.360 --> 12:49.601
Holy Mother of God!

12:51.040 --> 12:52.485
(HUFFING)

12:59.880 --> 13:01.848
Phillip Whitmore is on Line One.

13:02.880 --> 13:04.420
Tell him I'll call him back
in five minutes.

13:04.520 --> 13:05.660
Okay.

13:05.760 --> 13:06.940
(PHONE RINGING)

13:07.040 --> 13:08.371
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

13:10.080 --> 13:12.367
- Leah, you have a...
- LEAH: Tell him I'll be right there.

13:13.360 --> 13:16.682
You have a call on Line One.
He says his name is Carter Duncan.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.889
Okay, put him through.

13:22.880 --> 13:24.166
(PHONE RINGING)

13:26.240 --> 13:28.242
- Hello?
- CARTER: Leah Vaughn.

13:30.200 --> 13:33.460
I know I said I wouldn't do this,
but here I am.

13:33.560 --> 13:34.780
How did you find me?

13:34.880 --> 13:37.042
It's 2015, and I'm an I.T. expert.

13:37.440 --> 13:39.681
- It's not like I don't know your name.
- (CHUCKLES)

13:41.240 --> 13:44.020
Well, I, I guess I should be flattered.

13:44.120 --> 13:45.300
I wanna see you again.

13:45.400 --> 13:48.563
Well, I don't want to see you at all.

13:49.920 --> 13:51.763
What did you have in mind?

13:55.600 --> 13:56.620
(LAUGHING)

13:56.720 --> 14:00.964

to be in a public place,

or buy a girl a cup of coffee,

38:40.920 --> 38:43.969

a hundred times a day.

38:45.160 --> 38:49.460
But isn't this stalking
or harassment or something?

38:49.560 --> 38:52.260
The crime of stalking
is difficult to prosecute.

38:52.360 --> 38:55.740
We need to prove a pattern
of prolonged harassment by the individual.

38:55.840 --> 38:58.580
And even then, it's often a matter
of "she said, he said."

38:58.680 --> 39:01.445
So what am I supposed to do?
Just put up with it?

39:02.160 --> 39:05.926
Hopefully, he'll see his behavior is
getting him nowhere and stop on his own.

39:06.760 --> 39:10.082
This is what happens
in 95% of the cases.

39:10.200 --> 39:11.220
And if it doesn't?

39:11.320 --> 39:13.300
We can seek a restraining order,

39:13.400 --> 39:15.500

from coming near you.

in your situation

39:24.120 --> 39:26.500

I'm no detective,
but it seems to me that

55:18.640 --> 55:21.405

After that, he kept
a shotgun in his house.

01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:48.122
It was a 12-gauge Remington.

01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:51.340
I don't know what that means.

01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:53.620
Remington is the make.

01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:56.166
It holds seven rounds, or bullets.

01:20:56.600 --> 01:20:59.331
But in shotguns, they're called shells.

01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:01.940
Okay.

01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:05.300
So he loaded the first two shells
with bean bag rounds

01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:08.051
and the last five with regular shells.

01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:10.220
You... You lost me.

01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:13.802
Bean bag rounds
are little bags filled with lead shot.

01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:17.780
The bag is designed to protect the skin
from penetration.

01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:21.487
So, technically, they're classified
as non-lethal rounds.

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:25.380
So, he loaded the first two shells
with bean bags

01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:29.007
because a non-lethal round
qualifies as a warning shot.

01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:30.860
Why?

01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:35.682
Firing a warning shot is self-defense,
if you're standing in front of a judge.

01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:39.488
If a perpetrator continues
to threaten your safety,

01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:43.486
any shot after that is justifiable.

01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:48.680
LEAH: So...

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.810

What you do with that information
on your own time

01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:58.491
is none of my business.

01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:04.420
I don't like where this thing is going.

01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:07.763
We're talking because
maybe this ends badly.

01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:11.728

01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:14.091

this piece of shit tells you.

He fed me the same lies,
and then he stalked me.

01:22:57.560 --> 01:23:00.100
And then, he murdered
the man I was gonna marry.

01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:01.220
She's lying.

01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:03.300
Oh, and he's very charming.

01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:04.561
And persistent.

01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:08.765
Nothing will stop him, not even
restraining orders or the police.

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:11.820
