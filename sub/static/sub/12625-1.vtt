WEBVTT

00:35.001 --> 00:36.668
Marcus, Jordan!

00:36.703 --> 00:38.670
Heads up!

00:39.739 --> 00:41.407
I got it!

00:41.441 --> 00:42.674
I got it!

00:42.709 --> 00:43.709
I got it!

00:47.547 --> 00:49.014
I said I got it.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.783
Then why didn't you get it?

00:50.817 --> 00:53.252
You're such a ball hog!
I am not!

00:53.286 --> 00:55.154
Ok.

00:55.188 --> 00:58.657
Kimberly, this one's for you!

01:00.193 --> 01:01.226
Oh!

01:01.261 --> 01:02.261
No, wait!

01:02.295 --> 01:04.063
No, ok! Wait!

01:04.096 --> 01:05.631
Kimberly, your shoes!

01:05.665 --> 01:07.032
Ooh!

01:09.636 --> 01:11.036
I'm ok!

01:12.372 --> 01:14.740
Marcus, Jordan, come on!
Cut it out!

01:14.774 --> 01:16.875
You know how
i like it! Right here!

01:16.910 --> 01:19.711
There we go! There we go!

01:19.746 --> 01:22.781
Aah!
You broke my hand.

01:22.816 --> 01:25.184
I didn't break your hand,
you big baby!

01:25.218 --> 01:27.486
Your finger's just dislocated!

01:27.520 --> 01:29.922
Here! I'll reset it!

01:29.956 --> 01:31.690
Frankie.

01:31.724 --> 01:32.891
No. No, stay
away from me!

01:32.926 --> 01:34.693
Frankie!

01:34.727 --> 01:35.694
Aw, it won't hurt.

01:35.728 --> 01:36.662
Stay away!

01:36.696 --> 01:37.663
It's ok.

01:37.697 --> 01:38.697
Frankie!

01:39.999 --> 01:41.366
This one's going long.

01:48.775 --> 01:50.008
Aah!

02:08.428 --> 02:11.163
How many times have
i gotta tell ya?

02:11.197 --> 02:14.566
Never open the flaps
when the groundhogs
are warming up.

02:15.668 --> 02:16.668
Uhh!

02:22.175 --> 02:24.776
Well, it looks like we got
the whole team back.

02:24.811 --> 02:27.279
Yep, it sure does.

02:27.313 --> 02:29.014
I'm real sorry
about that, coach.

02:29.048 --> 02:30.149
Yep. Me, too.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.752
Me, too.

02:33.786 --> 02:36.455
Well, at least
we still got Eddie.

02:36.489 --> 02:37.689
Eddie: Heads!

02:39.526 --> 02:40.692
All right, guys, let's go!

02:40.727 --> 02:43.662
Frankie, Oliver, let's
take it around the infield!

02:43.696 --> 02:45.998
Yeah, at least we got Eddie.

02:51.371 --> 02:52.371
Nice catch!

02:55.642 --> 02:57.509
Ok, groundhogs, come on!

02:57.544 --> 02:58.544
Let's play some ball!

02:58.578 --> 03:00.145
Let's show the players
what we're made of!

03:00.180 --> 03:01.713
Hey, Oliver, you hang tough.

03:01.748 --> 03:03.549
Kimberly,
watch out!
Your shoe's...

03:04.617 --> 03:05.684
Kimberly: Ooh!

03:05.718 --> 03:07.352
I'm ok!

03:08.488 --> 03:11.190
Ok, groundhogs,
first game
of the season.

03:11.224 --> 03:14.660
I really think this
could be a winning
year for us.

03:14.694 --> 03:16.728
I'd be happy
with winning anything.

03:16.763 --> 03:18.697
We beat the panthers last year.

03:18.731 --> 03:20.399
They had the chickenpox.

03:20.433 --> 03:21.667
I know that!

03:21.701 --> 03:22.701
No, you don't.

03:22.735 --> 03:24.636
Also important to remember,

03:24.671 --> 03:26.104
this is a building year.

03:26.139 --> 03:27.472
Hey, sorry I'm late.

03:27.507 --> 03:29.141
Did I miss anything?

03:29.175 --> 03:32.644
Uh, Hannah,
why are you so... Pink?

03:32.679 --> 03:36.048
Oh. My mom thinks
I'm here trying out
to be a cheerleader.

03:36.082 --> 03:38.383
Whoever heard of
a baseball cheerleader?

03:38.418 --> 03:41.653
I think it's cool.
We could use a cheerleader.

03:41.688 --> 03:42.721
I want to be a cheerleader.

03:42.755 --> 03:44.156
Go for it.

03:44.190 --> 03:45.691
I'm just telling her that.

03:45.725 --> 03:47.693
Just 'cause
she was the ultimate
cheerleader,

03:47.727 --> 03:48.967
she thinks i should be one, too.

03:48.995 --> 03:50.429
Has she met you?

03:58.738 --> 04:00.172
Here goes!

04:00.206 --> 04:00.906
Ma'am.

04:00.940 --> 04:02.341
Thank you.

04:02.375 --> 04:04.443
Hey, batter, batter,
batter, batter, batter!

04:04.477 --> 04:06.578
Hannah! Anticipate.

04:06.613 --> 04:08.046
Aaron, put something into it.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.581
You're throwing like a girl.

04:09.616 --> 04:13.285
And, Oliver, could you be
any more out of position?

04:13.319 --> 04:15.687
Other than that,
good job, everybody!

04:17.156 --> 04:18.857
They're very fragile
at this age.

04:20.159 --> 04:23.095
Ok. Ogden's playing it
close to the base,

04:23.129 --> 04:24.830
ready for the line drive.

04:24.864 --> 04:27.933
Ok. Heads up! Heads up,
everybody! Heads up!

04:27.967 --> 04:29.635
Eddie: This is it.

04:29.669 --> 04:31.570
This could be the championship.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.014
Ha ha ha ha!

04:42.048 --> 04:44.049
Hey, hey! That was
pretty good.

04:44.083 --> 04:45.951
We actually might win
a couple of games.

04:45.985 --> 04:47.185
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

04:47.220 --> 04:48.987
Announcer: That's it, folks.
What a game.

04:49.022 --> 04:52.624
Players 10, groundhogs... 3.

04:52.659 --> 04:53.659
Frankie: Man!

04:53.693 --> 04:56.161
Announcer: Next stop
is last year's champion...

04:56.195 --> 04:57.729
Good job, guys.
Good job!

04:57.764 --> 04:58.897
See ya tomorrow afternoon.

04:58.931 --> 05:00.198
Now, remember, groundhogs,

05:00.233 --> 05:02.501
it's time to get serious
about winning, huh?

05:07.774 --> 05:10.075
Time to get a new team name.

05:10.109 --> 05:11.643
More fierce, less rodent.

05:11.678 --> 05:13.679
Time to get a new bat.

05:13.713 --> 05:15.113
This one can't hit a thing.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.182
I'll tell you what
it's time for.

05:25.258 --> 05:27.326
Eddie dogs.

05:27.360 --> 05:30.629
We've waited all year
for one of these.

05:56.756 --> 05:58.724
A little horseradish for heat,

05:58.758 --> 06:01.393
jalapeno to make us men,

06:01.427 --> 06:02.561
and they're done.

06:03.863 --> 06:06.164
Mmm! Mmm!

06:07.633 --> 06:09.167
Mmm!

06:12.805 --> 06:16.241
Hey, it's a couple
of grounder hogs.

06:16.275 --> 06:17.109
Losers!

06:17.143 --> 06:18.710
Just in case you didn't know,

06:18.745 --> 06:20.746
this is what a baseball
looks like.

06:20.780 --> 06:22.714
You wouldn't know a baseball

06:22.749 --> 06:24.082
if I served it
to you for dinner.

06:24.117 --> 06:25.684
Losers!
Losers!

06:25.718 --> 06:26.985
Hey, don't walk away from me

06:27.019 --> 06:29.654
when I'm
talking to you.
Come back here.

06:32.024 --> 06:33.992
I'd give anything
to beat those guys.

06:34.026 --> 06:35.961
All right, well,
then let's beat 'em.

06:35.995 --> 06:37.996
Every year's always a building
year for us, anyway.

06:38.030 --> 06:39.431
We might as well build
towards something.

06:39.465 --> 06:40.665
Really?

06:40.700 --> 06:41.600
Yeah, really.

06:41.634 --> 06:42.968
Ok, that's what
this season is all about...

06:43.002 --> 06:44.336
Beating the eagles.
Are you with me?

06:44.370 --> 06:46.171
Yeah!
Yeah!

06:52.612 --> 06:53.812
Did you hear?

06:53.846 --> 06:55.914
College scout
coming to the eagles
practice tomorrow.

06:55.948 --> 06:58.116
Well, why aren't
they coming to see Eddie?

06:58.151 --> 07:00.252
He's the best player
in the league.

07:00.286 --> 07:03.288
True. But you know
as well as I do...

07:03.322 --> 07:07.292
Groundhog practices,
sometimes they ain't
so pretty.

07:13.232 --> 07:16.067
Uh-oh.
I feel it, too.

07:16.102 --> 07:17.402
Brace yourself.

07:17.437 --> 07:18.703
Where is it?

07:18.738 --> 07:19.638
Woman: All right, guys!

07:19.672 --> 07:20.705
Hi, mom!

07:20.740 --> 07:21.807
Hi, honey.

07:21.841 --> 07:22.841
Hey.

07:22.875 --> 07:23.809
Whole team back?

07:23.843 --> 07:24.810
Yep.

07:24.844 --> 07:25.911
Oh. Sorry.

07:25.945 --> 07:27.145
Hey, come on, guys.
The game's on.

07:27.180 --> 07:28.580
Did you hear something?

07:28.614 --> 07:29.781
No, I didn't hear a thing.

07:29.816 --> 07:34.352
See, 32!
Now, change it back!

07:34.387 --> 07:35.387
Eddie.

07:36.556 --> 07:37.522
What's the matter?

07:37.557 --> 07:38.590
Hey, listen.

07:38.624 --> 07:39.724
You know, if you ever decide

07:39.759 --> 07:41.259
you don't want to
be a groundhog...

07:41.294 --> 07:43.728
Why wouldn't I want
to be a groundhog?

07:43.763 --> 07:44.663
I know it's frustrating for you

07:44.697 --> 07:45.864
never really
being able to play
the game

07:45.898 --> 07:47.065
you're capable of playing.

07:47.099 --> 07:48.667
What are you talking about?
I play all the time.

07:48.701 --> 07:50.068
No, that's not...

07:50.102 --> 07:51.736
Eddie, there's
a lot at stake
for you this year.

07:51.771 --> 07:52.838
If this is gonna be your future,

07:52.872 --> 07:55.540
we really need
to step your game up
another notch.

07:55.575 --> 07:56.608
Ok.

07:56.642 --> 07:57.642
Ow!
Get off my head!

07:57.677 --> 07:58.743
Whoa!

07:58.778 --> 08:01.413
Alex, get off of db.
He's a guest.

08:01.447 --> 08:03.615
Why do you have to put
that kind of pressure on him?

08:03.649 --> 08:04.583
It's just a game.

08:04.617 --> 08:05.717
Wedgie!

08:05.751 --> 08:07.752
Mom, it is not just a game.

08:07.787 --> 08:10.689
See? Eddie knows what
I'm talking about.

08:10.723 --> 08:13.191
The point is, with Eddie,

08:13.226 --> 08:14.793
it could be more
than just a game.

08:14.827 --> 08:16.461
I know he's only 14,

08:16.496 --> 08:18.763
but there's
a chance he could
have a pro career

08:18.798 --> 08:20.532
or at least a scholarship.

08:20.566 --> 08:23.702
It's not crazy
to think a pro scout
might spot him and...

08:23.736 --> 08:25.270
Have you ever heard him say

08:25.304 --> 08:27.739
he wants to be a professional
baseball player?

08:27.773 --> 08:30.442
I think I got
a pretty good handle

08:30.476 --> 08:31.710
on what Eddie wants.

08:31.744 --> 08:33.511
Eddie, tell your mother.

08:33.546 --> 08:35.813
I'm gonna... I'm gonna put
some brown sugar in here.

08:35.847 --> 08:38.582
We'll let
the brown sugar melt...

08:43.890 --> 08:45.323
Dad: Eddie.

08:48.227 --> 08:48.994
Eddie!

08:49.028 --> 08:50.695
What? Uh...

08:50.730 --> 08:52.531
Oh, yeah, that'd be great.

08:52.565 --> 08:54.299
Hmm?

08:54.333 --> 08:55.267
Boy: Red belly!

08:55.301 --> 08:56.334
Eddie, no.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.270
Why do you have
to push like that?

08:58.304 --> 08:59.738
If it's something
he really wants,

08:59.772 --> 09:01.306
he'll figure out
how to make it happen.

09:01.340 --> 09:02.407
I'm not pushing.

09:02.441 --> 09:04.075
I'm steering.
There's
a big difference.

09:04.110 --> 09:05.677
Ow!
Mmm! What happened?

09:05.711 --> 09:06.711
You all right?

09:06.746 --> 09:08.079
Ah! Everybody calm down.

09:08.114 --> 09:09.347
I just cut my finger.
I'm fine.

09:09.382 --> 09:10.749
Are you sure?
Here, let me see it.

09:10.783 --> 09:12.083
No, really, just
a couple of stitches.

09:12.118 --> 09:13.151
Stitches?
How bad is it?

09:13.185 --> 09:14.553
Honey, I can't help you

09:14.587 --> 09:15.687
if you won't let me see it.

09:15.721 --> 09:17.756
No. You know
how you are with blood.

09:17.790 --> 09:20.458
Honestly. One time
and a man's...

09:21.694 --> 09:22.861
Ooh, I better sit down.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.998
Sweetie, would you put
the food away, please?

09:27.033 --> 09:28.533
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:30.703 --> 09:32.237
Mom: Pat, deep breath.

09:32.271 --> 09:34.239
There's a paper bag
on the floor.

09:34.273 --> 09:36.775
Oh, it looks like
he's gonna be sick.

09:36.809 --> 09:39.711
Mom: Somebody open
a window, quick.

09:39.745 --> 09:42.614
Well, at least
we can watch the game.

09:54.694 --> 09:56.695
Is any of this stuff edible?

09:56.729 --> 09:58.697
Man, I'm starving.

09:58.731 --> 10:02.167
Figures.
Game's over already.

10:02.201 --> 10:04.502
You know you got
a piece of raw chicken
in your hand?

10:06.339 --> 10:09.240
Hey, what if instead
of putting this stuff away,

10:09.275 --> 10:11.109
we make something out of it?

10:11.143 --> 10:13.712
Let me think.
Uh... No.

10:13.746 --> 10:15.246
Come on, it'd be cool,

10:15.281 --> 10:17.716
and my mom would be
totally surprised.

10:17.750 --> 10:19.484
I'd rather pull out
my nose hairs.

10:19.518 --> 10:22.787
I'm with him. I'd rather
pull out <i> his</i> nose hairs.

10:22.822 --> 10:24.322
Besides, you don't
even know how to cook.

10:24.357 --> 10:25.690
Sure, I do.

10:25.725 --> 10:26.791
Kinda.

10:26.826 --> 10:28.193
I make Eddie dogs.

10:28.227 --> 10:29.694
How hard can this be?

10:29.729 --> 10:30.996
♪ Yeah ♪

10:45.778 --> 10:47.545
Fresh. Still some crunch.

10:47.580 --> 10:49.614

10:54.353 --> 10:57.689
Are you sure
the shells are supposed
to be in there?

10:59.258 --> 11:00.298
Hey, now, I'm just asking.

11:08.434 --> 11:10.535
Caraway.
Caraway.
Caraway.

11:19.111 --> 11:20.245
Come on, buddy, let's go.

11:20.279 --> 11:21.846
Keep going, keep it going.

11:21.881 --> 11:23.615
Get that for me,
get that for me.
Get that for me. Thank you.

11:23.649 --> 11:26.651
It's going good.
It's going good.
Mash 'em.

11:52.411 --> 11:54.079
Yeah.

11:54.113 --> 11:55.447
♪ Ooh, yeah ♪

11:55.481 --> 11:57.582
Hey, we got pizza!

11:57.616 --> 11:58.683
How's mom?

11:58.718 --> 11:59.718
I'm fine.

11:59.752 --> 12:01.720
Dad fainted twice.

12:01.754 --> 12:03.888
I didn't faint.
Men pass out,

12:03.923 --> 12:04.956
they don't faint.

12:04.990 --> 12:06.758
Did you put
the food away, honey?

12:06.792 --> 12:08.660
Nope.

12:08.694 --> 12:09.961
I cooked it instead.

12:15.301 --> 12:17.635
Ok. There's no way
I'm eating that.

12:19.505 --> 12:20.672
You're gonna lose it.

12:20.706 --> 12:23.174
Hey, how about that?

12:23.209 --> 12:25.744
Mom: Well, I, for one,
am quite impressed.

12:25.778 --> 12:27.645
You boys have done
an amazing job.

12:27.680 --> 12:29.714
Hey, don't look at us.
We had nothing
to do with it.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.349
It was all Eddie.

12:31.383 --> 12:33.685
Yeah, it was like
he was possessed
or something.

12:33.719 --> 12:36.621
Well, we're gonna
have to start calling
you chef <i> Eddie.</i>

12:37.757 --> 12:38.656
More like Eddie Crocker.

12:38.691 --> 12:39.691
Ooh!
Ooh!

12:39.725 --> 12:40.792
At least now I know

12:40.826 --> 12:41.693
what to get you
for your birthday.

12:41.727 --> 12:42.727
An apron!

12:43.763 --> 12:45.630
Or an easy-bake oven.

12:45.664 --> 12:46.765
Knock it off.

12:46.799 --> 12:48.333
You know, now,
he always did like

12:48.367 --> 12:49.934
making little cookies
with his play-doh.

12:49.969 --> 12:51.202
No, I didn't!

12:51.237 --> 12:52.277
Ok, I think that's enough.

12:52.304 --> 12:54.038
Oh, come on,
mom. Look.

12:54.073 --> 12:56.775
It's edwina,
the daughter you've
always wanted.

12:56.809 --> 12:58.610
Come on.
Hi, I'm edwina.

12:58.644 --> 13:01.079
I'm the little French chef
of the eighth grade,

13:01.113 --> 13:04.649
and my hobbies are cooking
and... And, well, cooking!

13:04.683 --> 13:06.184
I said knock it off!

13:06.218 --> 13:07.852
Oh, come on, relax, Eddie.

13:07.887 --> 13:09.254
We're just teasing ya.

13:09.288 --> 13:10.622
It's not like
anybody thinks
you're gonna

13:10.656 --> 13:12.590
trade in your
baseball mitt
for an oven mitt.

13:13.726 --> 13:15.160
I don't know, dad.

13:15.194 --> 13:17.262
Do they let girls
play in major
league baseball?

13:17.296 --> 13:18.530
Ohh!

13:18.564 --> 13:19.531
All right.

13:19.565 --> 13:20.665
Guys! Guys!

13:24.970 --> 13:26.738
No. Forget it.

13:26.772 --> 13:29.474
No way. I'm not
taking wood shop, ok?

13:29.508 --> 13:31.009
I like having 10 fingers.

13:31.043 --> 13:33.611
I can throw a baseball,
i can hold a pencil,

13:33.646 --> 13:34.779
and it means I can do this.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.080
Frankie, you're not listening.

13:36.115 --> 13:37.448
It's the easiest class.

13:37.483 --> 13:39.450
How hard can it be
to make a birdhouse?

13:39.485 --> 13:40.752
Besides, if you cut
something off,

13:40.786 --> 13:42.687
they pack it in ice,
sew it back on.

13:42.721 --> 13:43.688
It's no big deal.

13:43.722 --> 13:45.323
Guys, guys,
you're not even
listening, ok?

13:45.357 --> 13:47.458
Alex and Andy
both said that
computer science

13:47.493 --> 13:48.626
is the class to take.

13:48.661 --> 13:49.694
Everyone gets an "a,"

13:49.728 --> 13:51.696
and for homework,
you get to play
video games.

13:51.730 --> 13:52.697
Hey.

13:52.731 --> 13:53.998
Hmm.

13:54.033 --> 13:55.767
No, mom, I'm not playing
on the computer.

13:55.801 --> 13:57.302
I'm just studying for my final.

13:57.336 --> 13:58.903
They better have
an advanced placement,

13:58.938 --> 14:02.607
'cause I've been zapping
and blowing stuff up
since I was, like, 3.

14:29.735 --> 14:31.769
Hey, Eddie, come on!

14:31.804 --> 14:33.705
We're gonna be late
for registration.

14:33.739 --> 14:35.473
Sorry. I guess I, uh...

14:35.507 --> 14:37.742
I just never really noticed
that room before.

14:37.776 --> 14:39.344
Yeah, I know how you feel.

14:39.378 --> 14:42.347
I got the heebie-jeebies
the first time I saw it.

14:50.756 --> 14:51.756
All: Go!

14:55.127 --> 14:57.295
Sign us up!
We'll hold 'em back.

14:57.329 --> 14:58.329
Ok.

15:10.142 --> 15:12.710
M-m-my pen is broken.
I need a pen.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.345
Frankie: Pen! Pen!
Who has a pen?

15:20.085 --> 15:21.619
Get it! Get it!
Come on!

15:26.992 --> 15:27.992
Eddie!
Eddie!

15:28.027 --> 15:30.161
Where are you?

15:31.397 --> 15:33.598
Sign it! Sign it!

15:36.802 --> 15:38.069
Yes!
Yes!

15:38.103 --> 15:39.137
Computer science!

15:39.171 --> 15:40.705
Computer science! Yes!
Yes! Yes!

15:40.739 --> 15:43.708
Welcome to home economics.

15:46.512 --> 15:50.114
Oh, we're going to have
so much fun together.

15:50.149 --> 15:52.517
Eddie, I cannot
believe you did this.

15:52.551 --> 15:53.751
Sorry.
Here's the deal.

15:53.786 --> 15:56.220
Nobody, absolutely
nobody on the team
knows about this.

15:56.255 --> 15:58.256
It goes double for my brothers.

15:58.290 --> 16:00.425
I know
one person who's
gonna know for sure.

16:00.459 --> 16:01.492
Hannah?

16:01.527 --> 16:03.061
What are you doing here?

16:03.095 --> 16:05.163
I took field hockey
as an elective
the last 2 quarters.

16:05.197 --> 16:08.333
I thought my mom's
head might explode
if I took it again.

16:08.367 --> 16:10.368
What's your excuse?

16:10.402 --> 16:11.235
Eddie's an idiot.

16:11.270 --> 16:12.837
He grabbed the wrong clipboard.

16:12.871 --> 16:13.938
All right, guys.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.573
For the quadrillionth time,
I'm sorry,

16:15.607 --> 16:19.577
but I bet it's way better
than taking computer science.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.180
Look. What's that
all about?

16:23.749 --> 16:26.584
Check it out.
Custom cooking utensils.

16:26.618 --> 16:29.420
Somebody should have signed up
for get-a-life 101.

16:31.757 --> 16:34.058
Get a life? That's
really hilarious.

16:34.093 --> 16:35.259
Look, you little sprite.

16:35.294 --> 16:37.729
Every quarter there's
a group of stupid boys

16:37.763 --> 16:39.931
who get stuck
in here because
they were too stupid

16:39.965 --> 16:41.733
to sign up for
computers, or whatever,

16:41.767 --> 16:43.501
and start acting all...

16:43.535 --> 16:44.669
Stupid?

16:44.703 --> 16:46.270
Exactly, but I swear,

16:46.305 --> 16:48.339
if you don't sit down
and shut up,

16:48.374 --> 16:51.209
I'm gonna julienne you
up one side and back
down the other.

16:51.243 --> 16:52.677
Am I making myself clear?

16:52.711 --> 16:53.845
Not really.

16:53.879 --> 16:55.713
What's julienne?

16:55.748 --> 16:58.282
It means to chop
into thin strips.

16:58.317 --> 17:00.618
Bridget, stop scaring
the new students...

17:00.652 --> 17:02.420
And me.

17:02.454 --> 17:04.454
Mrs. Hadley, I was
going over the text,

17:04.490 --> 17:06.324
and I have
some suggestions...
Bridget, whoa.

17:06.358 --> 17:09.426
I kinda need to
welcome the class,
take roll,

17:09.461 --> 17:11.429
go over some basic
kitchen safety info.

17:13.732 --> 17:15.767
So, now, here's
a little something,

17:15.800 --> 17:18.869
a little something that
should start things off
with a bang.

17:18.904 --> 17:21.705
I have entry forms
for the 35th annual

17:21.740 --> 17:24.709
million-dollar
scholastic cook-off.

17:24.742 --> 17:26.411
Can you really win
a million dollars?

17:26.444 --> 17:28.311
No, no, no. That's
just how much they
give out in scholarships.

17:28.347 --> 17:30.515
No, it comes
with a small cash prize

17:30.549 --> 17:34.018
and a scholarship
to the country's pre-eminent
culinary institute.

17:37.656 --> 17:39.524
What's a cook-off, you ask?

17:42.661 --> 17:45.663
Well, it's open
to all students,
eighth grades and above,

17:45.697 --> 17:47.398
and that's you people.

17:47.433 --> 17:49.600
I was a finalist when
i was in high school.

17:51.370 --> 17:53.204
Hmm...

17:53.238 --> 17:57.075
To enter, a student must
submit an original recipe,

17:57.109 --> 17:59.177
and then, if selected
for the finals,

17:59.211 --> 18:02.180
the student will be put
through a live cooking exam

18:02.214 --> 18:04.449
to test their mastery
of the craft.

18:04.483 --> 18:06.517
I know, I know. It sounds
pretty exciting,

18:06.552 --> 18:07.685
so if you'd like a form,

18:07.719 --> 18:09.954
I have...

18:09.988 --> 18:12.423
Anybody else?

18:12.458 --> 18:13.591
Anybody at all?

18:14.960 --> 18:16.828
No? Oh.

18:16.862 --> 18:19.063
Ok. Well, there never is.

18:19.098 --> 18:23.668
Um, I thought that we'd
start with something basic,

18:23.702 --> 18:25.670
just let you get
your hands kinda...

18:25.704 --> 18:27.605
Kinda floury, so to speak.

18:28.640 --> 18:29.640
Get it?

18:31.477 --> 18:32.710
No. Nobody ever does.

18:32.744 --> 18:34.545
Um...

18:34.580 --> 18:37.482
Page 74, anatomy of a cookie.

18:38.750 --> 18:41.752
Man, home ec might
be totally boring,

18:41.787 --> 18:43.721
but sitting around
talking about cookies?

18:43.755 --> 18:45.556
How much easier can a class get?

18:49.495 --> 18:51.963
Ok. Ok, this is
an excellent example

18:51.997 --> 18:54.665
of why cooking time
and temperature

18:54.700 --> 18:56.434
is an integral part of baking.

19:01.507 --> 19:04.008
I'm sorry. I thought
they'd cook faster.

19:04.042 --> 19:06.377
Hmm, is it possible for a cookie

19:06.411 --> 19:08.546
to actually have
too many chocolate chips?

19:08.580 --> 19:12.617
There's no way I'm gonna
be able to eat all of these...

19:12.651 --> 19:15.052
But I can try.

19:20.559 --> 19:22.193
Oh. My backpack.

19:22.227 --> 19:23.427
Hold up.

19:54.059 --> 19:56.060
Ogden's at the fridge.

19:56.094 --> 19:57.461
He needs an original recipe,

19:57.496 --> 19:59.297
something no one has
ever tasted before.

19:59.331 --> 20:00.898
The fans are on their feet.

20:00.933 --> 20:03.601
What's it gonna be?

20:05.437 --> 20:07.171
Feel free to speak up.

20:52.084 --> 20:54.485
Cook-off, here we come.

20:56.488 --> 20:57.655
Ohh!

21:16.742 --> 21:21.178
Man, even p.B. And j.
Cannot get rid of the
taste of that last one.

21:36.161 --> 21:37.128
Ok.

21:37.162 --> 21:39.497
It's clinch time,
and ogden knows it.

21:39.531 --> 21:41.799
He's about to make
the play of the game.

21:41.833 --> 21:44.468
Peanut butter
and jelly smoothie.

21:44.503 --> 21:46.504
It's bold.

21:46.538 --> 21:47.705
It's daring.

21:50.509 --> 21:51.909
Oh! Ow! Come on...

21:51.943 --> 21:54.178
Please... stop!
Turn off!

21:54.212 --> 21:55.646
Oh!

21:57.649 --> 21:58.649
It's...

22:01.753 --> 22:03.287
Someone's coming.

22:26.678 --> 22:27.678
Mmm.

22:33.785 --> 22:35.653
It's official.

22:35.687 --> 22:37.655
He really is as dumb
as he looks.

22:45.564 --> 22:47.732
Dad: Eddie, I don't know
what's going on with you.

22:47.766 --> 22:48.899
You seem distracted.

22:48.934 --> 22:50.968
The missed plays,
foot off the bag.

22:51.002 --> 22:52.903
You know, if you're not gonna
take this seriously,

22:52.938 --> 22:53.938
why should I?

22:53.972 --> 22:55.306
I'm taking it seriously.

22:55.340 --> 22:57.174
Eddie, whether
you like it or not,

22:57.209 --> 22:58.709
you're the leader.
The team looks up to you

22:58.744 --> 23:00.344
and expects you
to set an example.

23:00.379 --> 23:01.245
I'm sorry.

23:01.279 --> 23:03.080
Baseball has got
to be your priority...

23:03.115 --> 23:04.782
And stop playing with your food.

23:04.816 --> 23:06.617
You're dancing around
like a little girl.

23:07.986 --> 23:10.855
Dad, baseball <i>is</i> my priority.

23:10.889 --> 23:14.325
I swear, it's
the most important thing
in the world to me.

23:15.827 --> 23:17.461
I know it is.

23:17.496 --> 23:19.597
I don't mean to come
down hard on you.

23:24.669 --> 23:25.870
It's just...

23:25.904 --> 23:27.271
That you're so good,

23:27.305 --> 23:29.340
and you got so much potential.

23:31.743 --> 23:34.612
Less coach, more dad.

23:36.648 --> 23:38.783
So, how was school today?

23:38.817 --> 23:40.751
Did you sign up
for computer science

23:40.786 --> 23:42.787
like your brothers told you to?

23:42.821 --> 23:45.689
Uh... Yeah. It was
our very first choice.

23:45.724 --> 23:47.391
Good boy.

23:47.426 --> 23:50.895
Eddie, you'd tell
me if something was
bothering you, right?

23:50.929 --> 23:53.431
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

23:53.465 --> 23:54.498
No, everything's cool.

23:56.101 --> 23:57.601
Now, though similar,

23:57.636 --> 24:00.671
each leavening agent
has its own advantages

24:00.705 --> 24:02.339
and disadvantages.

24:02.374 --> 24:04.975
Now, yeast is a living organism,

24:05.010 --> 24:09.947
and it contains over
3,200 billion cells per pound.

24:09.981 --> 24:12.283
Now, it comes in several
different forms.

24:12.317 --> 24:15.419
We're gonna be working
today with the dry form.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.555
There's a few
that will be using
the baking powder

24:17.589 --> 24:19.590
and the baking soda combo
for making tea breads,

24:19.624 --> 24:23.294
but we're gonna be mostly
talking about the dry yeast.

24:23.328 --> 24:25.095
Now, the most important
thing to remember...

24:25.130 --> 24:26.664
It's your turn.
Pick a letter.

24:26.698 --> 24:28.966
Uh... Q.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.368
Mrs. Hadley: If the water's
too hot or too cold...

24:31.403 --> 24:34.138
Man, you're really bad at this.

24:34.172 --> 24:35.739
You'll end up with crackers.

24:35.774 --> 24:37.942
All right, then,
let's start cooking.

24:40.812 --> 24:43.380
Ok, I'm done talking now.
You can move.

24:44.649 --> 24:47.351
All right.
Move it, people!

24:57.729 --> 24:59.763
Hey.
What?

24:59.798 --> 25:02.266
Hey.

25:02.300 --> 25:03.901
And I said what?

25:03.935 --> 25:05.703
So, have you found
your recipe yet,

25:05.737 --> 25:07.705
you know,
for the cook-off?

25:07.739 --> 25:10.241
I'm working on it.
Why do you care?

25:10.275 --> 25:11.475
Just curious.

25:11.510 --> 25:13.711
Uh... Do you think
people would ever
use peanut butter

25:13.745 --> 25:15.312
as a primary ingredient?

25:15.347 --> 25:18.616
Well, the peanut is the most
versatile of the legumes,

25:18.650 --> 25:21.519
so why couldn't it
be the cornerstone
of any sound entry?

25:21.553 --> 25:23.521
I'll take that
as a yes. Have you
ever noticed

25:23.555 --> 25:24.855
that when
you heat it up just
right and...

25:24.890 --> 25:26.156
What are you doing?

25:26.191 --> 25:27.825
Nothing.

25:27.859 --> 25:29.026
We're talking
about the cook-off.

25:29.060 --> 25:30.961
No, we're not.
Yes, we are.

25:30.996 --> 25:32.596
She's crazy.
Come on, we better
get back to...

25:32.631 --> 25:34.798
Hey, is there something
going on with you guys?

25:34.833 --> 25:36.700
With me and Bridget?
Get real.

25:36.735 --> 25:38.602
Hello! Standing right here.

25:38.637 --> 25:41.739
It sounds to me like
someone's really starting

25:41.773 --> 25:44.742
to take an interest
in this class.

25:44.776 --> 25:47.344
No, I'm not.
I hate this class.

25:47.379 --> 25:51.215
Ok. Interest might have
been a little strong.

25:52.784 --> 25:55.386
Then... What are
you doing over here?

25:55.420 --> 25:57.655
I, uh...

25:57.689 --> 25:59.757
I...

25:59.791 --> 26:03.227
I just came over
here to do this.

26:07.432 --> 26:09.633
Eddie.

26:09.668 --> 26:11.101
You know what i gotta do, right?

26:11.136 --> 26:12.469
Db.

26:12.504 --> 26:14.305
If you must, you must.

26:15.874 --> 26:18.142
Stay calm.
Take a deep breath.

26:18.176 --> 26:20.611
And, class, everybody,
we don't want a...

26:20.645 --> 26:21.645
Food fight!

26:27.352 --> 26:29.219
Food fight... now,
that's the thing

26:29.254 --> 26:31.088
we definitely want to avoid.

26:38.530 --> 26:39.563
Food fight!

26:47.606 --> 26:49.640
Cover me.
I'm going in.

26:50.709 --> 26:51.675
Aah!

26:51.710 --> 26:52.977
Uhh...

26:58.883 --> 27:02.519
I swear, boys are never
setting foot
in this class agai...

27:04.789 --> 27:06.624
Apologies all around, ladies!

27:07.692 --> 27:09.560
Good arm, Hannah.

27:13.231 --> 27:16.133
Oh! Martha Stewart never
had to put up with this.

27:17.202 --> 27:18.235
Aah!

27:38.823 --> 27:41.091
That was absolutely
the best food fight

27:41.126 --> 27:43.127
I've ever had in my entire life,

27:43.161 --> 27:45.462
even with a month of
Saturday detention.

27:45.497 --> 27:47.765
Even better than that
summer camp soda massacre?

27:47.799 --> 27:49.600
Even better than
the ice cream fight

27:49.634 --> 27:50.634
at my cousin's sweet 16?

27:50.669 --> 27:52.336
Totally.

27:52.370 --> 27:54.338
Even better than
the second-grade
spaghetti melee?

27:55.840 --> 27:57.041
Hey.

27:57.075 --> 27:58.776
Yo, it's gonna
take Bridget, like, weeks

27:58.810 --> 28:00.611
to get that cake batter
out of her hair.

28:00.645 --> 28:02.946
She should just enter herself
into that cook-off.

28:02.981 --> 28:04.882
I guess I shouldn't
have blasted her
with that egg.

28:04.916 --> 28:06.517
Eddie:
That was so gross.

28:07.686 --> 28:09.119
Hey, you know what's gross?

28:10.355 --> 28:11.588
This.

28:14.592 --> 28:15.993
Oh, that is disgusting.

28:16.027 --> 28:17.594
That is nasty.
Eew.

28:18.830 --> 28:20.798
Ohh!

28:20.832 --> 28:23.233
Hey! Now,
that's not bad.

28:23.268 --> 28:24.935
Actually, that's
better than not bad.

28:24.969 --> 28:27.971
I'd have to say
that's quite
delicious.

28:32.577 --> 28:33.711
What?

28:33.745 --> 28:35.012
Hey, we missed lunch

28:35.046 --> 28:36.180
and I'm hungry.

28:44.656 --> 28:45.689
Mmm!

28:45.724 --> 28:46.690
Frankie: Good.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.025
Hey, this is great.

28:48.059 --> 28:50.360
It tastes kinda like
barbecue sauce,

28:50.395 --> 28:52.129
only better.

28:52.163 --> 28:54.598
Hey, you put
this stuff on anything,

28:54.632 --> 28:55.666
and I'll eat it.

28:58.002 --> 29:00.237
Ok, we've got
to find out what
was in this.

29:00.271 --> 29:01.505
Do you remember what
they were making
at this station?

29:01.539 --> 29:03.507
And why is it
purple? What is
this texture?

29:03.541 --> 29:05.061
Does it remind you
re o of applesce
up k

29:05.610 --> 29:07.578
dude.

29:07.612 --> 29:09.546
Get a grip.

29:09.581 --> 29:11.915
I mean, it's good,
but it's just a bowl
of purple sauce.

29:11.950 --> 29:12.883
Well, yeah, but...

29:12.917 --> 29:14.551
But what?

29:16.020 --> 29:17.955
Uh... But nothing.

29:17.989 --> 29:20.991
Come on. We still
gotta wash down
the ceiling.

29:31.202 --> 29:33.637
Samson...

29:33.671 --> 29:36.140
We have sauce.

29:38.376 --> 29:39.810
All right, come on, guys!
We can do this!

29:39.844 --> 29:41.678
Mmm!

29:41.713 --> 29:44.214
Ok, groundhogs, focus.
We're still in this.

29:46.151 --> 29:48.552
Frankie.

29:48.586 --> 29:50.554
Hey, I gotta keep up
with my Yankees.

29:55.093 --> 29:57.361
Ok, Jordan, come on!
Come on, let's go.

29:57.395 --> 29:58.955
Don't let those panthers
intimidate you!

30:00.999 --> 30:03.934
All right, Jordan!
All right! Way to go!

30:03.968 --> 30:05.869
He hit it!
I can't believe it!

30:05.904 --> 30:07.905
We might actually win!

30:07.939 --> 30:09.239
Oliver.

30:09.274 --> 30:12.042
What are you doing?

30:12.076 --> 30:14.411
Hey, is that
the gunk from class?

30:16.915 --> 30:18.549
Did you make that?

30:20.251 --> 30:22.186
Would you guys chill out?

30:22.220 --> 30:24.922
It's my mom's recipe
she got from a magazine.

30:24.956 --> 30:26.957
Well, put it away, people.

30:26.991 --> 30:28.325
There's no food in the dugout.

30:28.359 --> 30:29.760
What's the matter with you?

30:30.862 --> 30:33.630
Eddie, you're up.

30:33.665 --> 30:35.799
It's all up to you,
buddy.
Ok.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.467
Let's go, Eddie.
Go, Eddie.

30:37.502 --> 30:40.170
Oliver: Tell your mom
it's the best sauce
I've ever tasted.

30:40.205 --> 30:42.439
All right, Eddie, let's go!

30:42.473 --> 30:43.874
All right!
Let's go, Eddie!

30:43.908 --> 30:45.375
No problem.

30:53.918 --> 30:55.853
We win!
Ha ha ha ha ha!

31:01.893 --> 31:03.594
Mom: Congratulations,
groundhogs.

31:03.628 --> 31:05.829
I think this might be
the start of something big.

31:05.864 --> 31:06.997
All: Yeah.

31:07.031 --> 31:08.866
Hannah, you were
fantastic today.

31:08.900 --> 31:11.268
You're really one of the guys.

31:11.302 --> 31:12.703
If we keep working,

31:12.737 --> 31:15.672
there is no reason we
can't beat the eagles.

31:15.707 --> 31:17.908
Man, would I love
to beat that coach.

31:17.942 --> 31:20.978
For all his tough talk,
you know what he does
for a living?

31:21.012 --> 31:23.013
He's a nurse.

31:23.047 --> 31:25.415
You're gonna spit
your gum out, right?

31:44.035 --> 31:45.869
Bridget: But you can't
just test it once.

31:45.904 --> 31:47.170
You've got to
double-check it.

31:47.205 --> 31:48.839
Actually,
triple-check it.

31:48.873 --> 31:50.974
Mrs. Hadley:
I know, dear.

31:51.009 --> 31:53.410
This isn't my first
time at the rodeo.

31:53.444 --> 31:55.879
What does that have
to do with anything?

31:55.914 --> 31:58.515
Is that your big
cook-off recipe?

31:58.549 --> 31:59.950
Aren't you finished yet?

31:59.984 --> 32:01.752
So not your business.

32:01.786 --> 32:04.888
She finished yesterday,
but we're just making
sure everything

32:04.923 --> 32:06.156
is absolutely perfect.

32:06.190 --> 32:08.492
Oh, I sifted the flour twice.

32:08.526 --> 32:10.260
Make sure you
take that into account.

32:10.295 --> 32:12.095
Oh, I assume that would be here.

32:12.130 --> 32:13.931
The part that you underlined...

32:13.965 --> 32:16.867
In bold, and put arrows around.

32:16.901 --> 32:18.669
I, uh, i don't understand.

32:18.703 --> 32:20.804
You wouldn't.
Cooking is a science,

32:20.838 --> 32:22.940
and all
of the measurements
have to be precise,

32:22.974 --> 32:25.008
down to the last
quarter-teaspoon.

32:25.043 --> 32:26.443
That's the little one.

32:26.477 --> 32:28.812
If they're not,
you're immediately
disqualified.

32:31.015 --> 32:32.516
Oh, well, uh,

32:32.550 --> 32:33.850
well, good luck with that.

32:33.885 --> 32:35.319
Whatever.

32:45.463 --> 32:48.732
Ok. Only an hour
before anyone gets home.

32:48.766 --> 32:50.067
All right. Don't panic.

32:50.101 --> 32:51.935
Just start with 2 cups of sugar

32:51.970 --> 32:53.904
and work your way
back from there.

32:53.938 --> 32:56.673
No! We're out of sugar.

32:56.708 --> 32:57.941
Now what?

32:59.410 --> 33:00.911
Mom!

33:00.945 --> 33:02.479
I can explain.

33:05.917 --> 33:07.017
There's this contest, you know,

33:07.051 --> 33:08.485
like on the back
of cereal boxes.

33:08.519 --> 33:10.187
Like the million dollar
cook-off.

33:11.456 --> 33:13.924
The entry form is next to you.

33:13.958 --> 33:15.392
It's not what you're thinking.

33:15.426 --> 33:17.160
It's not some stupid
girl thing...

33:17.195 --> 33:18.328
I mean, it is mainly girls,

33:18.363 --> 33:19.496
but guys can enter, too.

33:19.530 --> 33:20.731
And it comes
with this cash prize,

33:20.765 --> 33:22.799
and this scholarship
to this amazing school.

33:22.834 --> 33:24.501
And I don't know
if you've ever seen
the food channel,

33:24.535 --> 33:25.902
but, like,
every other person
on there is a guy,

33:25.937 --> 33:29.272
so I don't know why
you're making such
a big deal out of this!

33:29.307 --> 33:31.308
Ok. I don't think

33:31.342 --> 33:33.343
I'm the one who's making
a big deal out of it.

33:35.013 --> 33:36.980
Why is this so important to you?

33:37.015 --> 33:39.016
I don't know.

33:39.050 --> 33:40.450
It's not.

33:43.988 --> 33:47.124
Hey, maybe if I win,
it won't matter
if I like to do it.

33:47.158 --> 33:48.892
Who says you have to win?

33:48.926 --> 33:50.594
So, that's it?

33:50.628 --> 33:52.496
That's what this
is all about...
you like to cook?

33:52.530 --> 33:54.965
It was just some dumb idea.

33:54.999 --> 33:57.768
Can we please just
forget about it?

33:57.802 --> 34:00.103
And deprive the world

34:00.138 --> 34:03.807
of Eddie's incredible
edible barbecue sauce?

34:07.845 --> 34:09.880
Ok, but you can't tell dad.

34:09.914 --> 34:11.214
Or Alex and Andy.

34:11.248 --> 34:13.216
I can't lie to your father.

34:13.251 --> 34:14.751
I really think he would
understand if...

34:14.786 --> 34:17.654
No, he wouldn't.
And you know he wouldn't.

34:17.688 --> 34:20.023
Well, maybe he would.

34:20.058 --> 34:22.225
Ok, maybe he wouldn't.

34:22.260 --> 34:24.795
Anyway, what have you
got left to do?

34:26.197 --> 34:27.764
How can I help?

35:35.833 --> 35:37.767
Way to go, Eddie!

35:39.570 --> 35:41.872
You two have got to be
the double play kings.

35:41.906 --> 35:43.473
Or king and queen.

35:43.508 --> 35:44.908
You had it right at kings.

35:47.845 --> 35:48.979
Excuse me, class.

35:49.013 --> 35:51.181
I've got a little
announcement to make.

35:51.215 --> 35:52.782
Well, actually,

35:52.817 --> 35:55.852
it's quite
a big announcement.
It's huge.

35:55.887 --> 35:59.356
Um, I've just gotten
off the phone
with the cook-off people.

35:59.390 --> 36:03.226
And, you know,
they were so sweet.

36:03.261 --> 36:05.362
They all remembered me.

36:05.396 --> 36:09.866
Said people still talking
about my winning triple
Berry torte 30 years later.

36:09.901 --> 36:12.636
And... i don't know... maybe
they were just being nice.

36:12.670 --> 36:14.304
Of course, they were
just being nice.

36:14.338 --> 36:16.606
Did I make the finals,
or didn't I?

36:16.641 --> 36:18.842
Bridget, there's
a little something

36:18.876 --> 36:20.777
called building anticipation.

36:22.180 --> 36:24.948
Yes, Bridget,
you are in the finals.

36:24.982 --> 36:27.317
Oh, my gosh, yes!

36:28.653 --> 36:30.387
Go, Bridget.

36:32.023 --> 36:33.423
Ohh.

36:33.457 --> 36:34.925
Oh... and... oh,

36:34.959 --> 36:36.626
the other finalist

36:36.661 --> 36:39.062
is Eddie ogden.

36:39.096 --> 36:40.363
Yes!

36:44.468 --> 36:45.468
Yes.

36:48.706 --> 36:50.106
Hey!

36:50.141 --> 36:51.541
I got in, too.

36:51.576 --> 36:53.944
My recipe used
3 different types
of cheeses.

36:53.978 --> 36:56.046
I have copies.

36:56.080 --> 36:57.948
Does anyone want to see?

36:57.982 --> 37:01.551
I'm making a difference.

37:01.586 --> 37:02.752
I really am.

37:08.893 --> 37:10.293
Wait, db, come on.
Don't be mad.

37:10.328 --> 37:12.095
I'm sorry.
It was just a joke.

37:12.129 --> 37:13.730
I thought it would be funny.

37:13.764 --> 37:16.132
Jokes are usually
funnier when you share
them with your friends.

37:16.167 --> 37:17.534
I know.
I should've told you.

37:17.568 --> 37:19.336
I just thought that
you would think
it was stupid.

37:19.370 --> 37:22.239
Yeah. Good guess.
I do think it's stupid.

37:22.273 --> 37:24.307
Just tell me this...

37:24.342 --> 37:27.143
Do you like home ec?

37:27.178 --> 37:28.745
Yes or no?

37:29.880 --> 37:31.781
No, I don't like it.

37:33.784 --> 37:34.784
I... i don't know.

37:34.819 --> 37:37.821
Maybe I don't hate it
as much as you guys do.

37:37.855 --> 37:39.189
Sometimes it's not that bad.

37:41.092 --> 37:42.959
Ok. I like it.

37:42.994 --> 37:45.061
I like making something
out of nothing.

37:45.096 --> 37:47.697
I like figuring out
what goes together.

37:47.732 --> 37:50.934
I like doing something
no one's ever done before.

37:50.968 --> 37:53.870
I don't know why.
I just like it.

37:53.904 --> 37:56.006
He likes it.

37:56.040 --> 37:57.941
Come on, this is stupid.

37:57.975 --> 38:00.977
I won with that
gross purple gunk.

38:01.012 --> 38:03.313
This whole cook-off thing
is a total joke.

38:03.347 --> 38:07.284
You gotta admit,
it is kinda funny.

38:08.886 --> 38:10.687
Yeah. Kinda.

38:11.889 --> 38:13.423
I thought Bridget's head

38:13.457 --> 38:15.325
was gonna spin right off.

38:15.359 --> 38:17.093
Hey, you know
what's gonna be funny?

38:17.128 --> 38:19.429
Your dad's face
when he finds out.

38:20.965 --> 38:22.265
My dad!

38:40.885 --> 38:41.851
Hey, I'm home.

38:41.886 --> 38:45.655
Both: Edwina's home!

38:45.690 --> 38:47.824
Hey... Lookin' for this?

38:47.858 --> 38:48.825
Gimme that!

38:48.859 --> 38:50.527
Oh!

38:50.561 --> 38:52.962
Ok, ok. You can torture
your brother later.

38:52.997 --> 38:54.898
Go on.
Go, go, go, go.

38:59.603 --> 39:00.937
It's a certificate.

39:00.971 --> 39:03.139
And they ruined it.

39:03.174 --> 39:05.208
You know, it's against the law

39:05.242 --> 39:06.843
to read other people's mail.

39:06.877 --> 39:07.844
Oh, they didn't open it.

39:07.878 --> 39:10.013
Your home ec teacher called

39:10.047 --> 39:11.981
to share in our excitement.

39:12.016 --> 39:14.017
You don't look very excited.

39:14.051 --> 39:15.485
Oh, really?

39:15.519 --> 39:17.120
Because nothing excites me more

39:17.154 --> 39:18.521
than having my son lie to me

39:18.556 --> 39:21.057
and sneak around behind my back.

39:21.092 --> 39:23.560
I'm sorry that I lied.

39:23.594 --> 39:26.363
And this cook-off thing...
What's that about?

39:26.397 --> 39:29.332
It's nothing.
It's just a thing.

39:29.367 --> 39:31.768
It's not gonna
interfere with baseball

39:31.802 --> 39:33.103
or school or anything.

39:33.137 --> 39:34.704
I promise.

39:34.739 --> 39:36.840
Eddie, I thought
we had some kind
of understanding.

39:38.876 --> 39:42.846
Hi. Everybody's
home early.

39:42.880 --> 39:44.114
What's going on?

39:44.148 --> 39:46.516
I got into
the cook-off.

39:46.550 --> 39:49.753
Oh, honey, that's great.
Congratulations.

39:54.058 --> 39:56.860
Obviously, this isn't
coming as a big surprise
to you.

39:56.894 --> 39:59.929
No. Not really.

39:59.964 --> 40:02.899
I mean, his recipe
was really good.

40:07.471 --> 40:10.807
Eddie, is there some reason
you told your mother
and not me?

40:12.510 --> 40:14.511
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

40:14.545 --> 40:17.180
I guess I was
just... Afraid.

40:18.215 --> 40:20.417
I don't know what
i was afraid of.

40:20.451 --> 40:22.819
I think we all know
what you were afraid of.

40:27.491 --> 40:29.492
Ok. Fine.

40:29.527 --> 40:32.996
Clearly, I have no idea
what's going on
around here anymore.

40:33.030 --> 40:35.131
You think you can handle it,

40:35.166 --> 40:37.267
more power to you.

40:40.838 --> 40:41.838
Handle what?

40:43.674 --> 40:46.342
Not only is Eddie ogden
the first boy

40:46.377 --> 40:49.746
from cedar valley junior high
to make the finals,

40:49.780 --> 40:52.348
he's also the only boy
in his age bracket.

40:55.786 --> 40:59.088
Oh, and Bridget Simmons
is also a finalist.

40:59.123 --> 41:02.559

We've got some serious
cook-off training to do!

Alrighty, then,

42:15.065 --> 42:16.833
I really don't think
we need to do this.

42:16.867 --> 42:18.234
I'm serious.

42:18.269 --> 42:20.703
So am I. Start
cracking those eggs
before they hatch.

42:26.977 --> 42:29.145
Hmm. Smooth.

42:29.179 --> 42:31.281
Ok, so I can't crack an egg.

42:31.315 --> 42:33.583

42:54.972 --> 42:56.039
Well, you're gonna learn.

42:56.073 --> 42:59.409
The finals are about knowledge

42:59.443 --> 43:00.910
and mastery of a craft,

43:00.945 --> 43:03.646
and they can throw
anything at you.

you'd rather bake cakes

45:35.132 --> 45:36.532

45:36.567 --> 45:38.234
you brought your
sister's Barbie to
show and tell

45:38.268 --> 45:39.769
like, 3 times.

by 2 runs.

46:37.561 --> 46:40.863
Umpire: Strike 3!
You're out!

46:40.898 --> 46:43.432
Ok, Jordan, you're up.

46:43.467 --> 46:44.534
Jordan.

46:44.568 --> 46:45.835
No, come on, dad, put me in.

46:45.869 --> 46:46.836
There's 2 outs.

46:46.870 --> 46:47.870
You missed 3 innings.

46:47.905 --> 46:49.205
You're out of the game.

46:49.239 --> 46:51.440
Out of the game?

46:51.475 --> 46:53.242
Come on, can't you
make an exception?

46:55.145 --> 46:56.913
Longo...

46:56.947 --> 46:58.915
Is there a souffle exception?

46:58.949 --> 47:01.250
Nope. Just one
for apple pie.

47:02.920 --> 47:05.188
Umpire: Strike 3!
You're out!

47:05.222 --> 47:07.323
Ok, everybody out on the field.

47:07.357 --> 47:10.092
Hannah, keep playing first.
Db, you take short.

47:10.127 --> 47:11.894
Come on, groundhogs, let's go!

47:11.929 --> 47:14.764
Come on, guys.
Hustle, hustle, hustle!

47:22.506 --> 47:23.973
I figured it out last night.

47:24.007 --> 47:25.408
Even though we lost yesterday,

47:25.442 --> 47:26.843
we just have to win
one more game,

47:26.877 --> 47:27.877
then we get to play the eagless

47:27.911 --> 47:29.078
for the championships.

47:29.112 --> 47:30.346
Ok, that's cool.
Yeah.

47:31.882 --> 47:33.216
Hey, it's the hogs!

47:33.250 --> 47:35.751
The only team with
their own chef!

47:38.388 --> 47:41.524
So... What are
you gonna do
on the 15th?

47:41.558 --> 47:42.825
What?

47:42.860 --> 47:44.193
The 15th.

47:44.228 --> 47:45.361
If we make it to the playoffs,

47:45.395 --> 47:46.963
that's the day
we play the eagles.

47:46.997 --> 47:49.131
And it's also the day
of your cook-off.

47:51.835 --> 47:53.703
So what's it gonna be?

47:54.805 --> 47:56.272
Well, i...
yeah, that's
what I thought.

47:56.306 --> 47:57.373
Hey, why are you mad at me

47:57.407 --> 47:58.808
for something that
might not even happen?

47:58.842 --> 48:02.678
Why don't you go sit
with the girls,
swap recipes?

48:02.713 --> 48:03.880
Here's my applesauce.

48:03.914 --> 48:06.048
Maybe you can bake
a cake out of it
or something.

48:06.083 --> 48:07.750
Or something.

48:09.653 --> 48:11.387
Food fight!

48:15.025 --> 48:17.827
You're just mad
'cause you couldn't win
a baseball game by yourself

48:17.861 --> 48:19.462
if your life depended on it.

48:22.900 --> 48:24.233
I'd rather win like a man

48:24.268 --> 48:25.701
than cook like a girl.

48:25.736 --> 48:26.836
Come on, you're teammates!

48:26.870 --> 48:28.204
Not anymore.
I quit.

48:28.238 --> 48:30.573
Eddie, no, you can't!

49:10.881 --> 49:12.148
I don't care what you say,

49:12.182 --> 49:14.850
but that was definitely
the greatest food fight

49:14.885 --> 49:16.385
of all time.

49:16.420 --> 49:18.754
I mean, I just felt so free...

49:20.457 --> 49:21.724
Ok, so...

49:21.758 --> 49:23.826
I'm not the one who has
to clean the cafeteria

49:23.860 --> 49:25.061
every day for the next month,

49:25.095 --> 49:26.729
but if you look
at it my way...
Frankie.

49:31.835 --> 49:32.802
You see?

49:32.836 --> 49:35.671
There?

49:35.706 --> 49:36.806
Like that.

49:36.840 --> 49:37.840
Is that applesauce in your hair?

49:37.874 --> 49:39.475
Yeah, I'm baking a cake later.

49:41.011 --> 49:42.878
How much longer do
we have to do this?

49:42.913 --> 49:44.947
Where do you have to go?

49:44.982 --> 49:47.116
I hear your baseball
career is over.

49:47.150 --> 49:50.119
Ok, focus, people.
Focus, people. Hmm?

49:50.153 --> 49:51.187
This is crunch time.

49:51.221 --> 49:52.688
Magic hour is just a week away,

49:52.723 --> 49:54.824
and neither of you can
chop to save your life.

49:54.858 --> 49:57.093
Ok, now.

49:57.127 --> 49:58.227
When it comes to julienneing,

49:58.261 --> 49:59.962
there are 2 schools of thought.

49:59.997 --> 50:01.797
There's the ultra-skinny

50:01.832 --> 50:03.332
French toothpick style,

50:03.367 --> 50:05.735
and then there is
the more robust

50:05.769 --> 50:07.570
American matchstick style.

50:07.604 --> 50:09.005
Now, each has its pros and cons.

50:09.039 --> 50:10.106
This is so stupid.

50:10.140 --> 50:12.608
Who cares how big they are?

50:12.642 --> 50:16.112
Who cares if they're
in cubes or stars

50:16.146 --> 50:18.514
or little sticks?
They're carrots!

50:18.548 --> 50:20.116
And no matter what
you do to them,

50:20.150 --> 50:23.252
they're going to
taste like carrots.

50:23.286 --> 50:24.920
This is a total waste of time.

50:24.955 --> 50:26.422
Hey!

50:26.456 --> 50:28.124
I'm guessing there's more.

50:28.158 --> 50:30.026
Yeah, there's a lot more.

50:30.060 --> 50:31.660
I hate not having any friends.

50:31.695 --> 50:33.195
I hate that my dad
can barely look at me.

50:33.230 --> 50:34.964
I hate that my brothers
tease me.

50:34.998 --> 50:36.365
I hate that everybody
makes fun of me

50:36.400 --> 50:37.900
because of this
stupid cook-off,

50:37.934 --> 50:38.968
and more than anything,

50:39.002 --> 50:41.737
I hate chopping up vegetables.

50:42.839 --> 50:43.839
Are you through?

50:45.542 --> 50:48.344
You may hate
all those things now,

50:48.378 --> 50:50.646
Eddie ogden, but I'm guessing...

50:50.680 --> 50:54.016
That deep down,
you love cooking even more.

50:54.051 --> 50:56.085
So don't talk yourself
out of doing this

50:56.119 --> 50:57.119
just because...

50:57.154 --> 50:59.789
Look, forget it.
I'm done.

50:59.823 --> 51:01.657
I'm going back to where
I'm supposed to be.

51:08.131 --> 51:09.532
Eddie...

51:18.175 --> 51:20.709
Do you think that's why
everybody makes fun of me?

51:20.744 --> 51:22.078
Because I love to cook?

51:22.112 --> 51:24.313
No! Oh, no.

51:24.347 --> 51:25.948
There are plenty
of other reasons.

51:25.982 --> 51:28.150
Ok, back to chopping.

51:32.589 --> 51:33.456
Ok!

51:33.490 --> 51:34.924
I don't want to
psych you guys out,

51:34.958 --> 51:36.559
but we beat the cougars,

51:36.593 --> 51:38.928
and we're in
the playoffs! Huh?

51:38.962 --> 51:41.197
Yeah! Ha ha!

51:41.231 --> 51:42.798
Where's Eddie?

51:42.833 --> 51:43.799
Baking cookies.

51:43.834 --> 51:45.601
Ok, now, look.
I know you guys can do this,

51:45.635 --> 51:47.703
but it's gonna take
a little strategy.

51:47.737 --> 51:49.405
First, keep the ball low

51:49.439 --> 51:51.140
and down the third base line.

51:51.174 --> 51:53.976
The cougar third baseman...
He can catch anything,

51:54.010 --> 51:55.377
but he throws like a real girl.

51:55.412 --> 51:57.079
He can barely get it to first...

51:57.114 --> 51:58.447
I throw like a girl.

51:58.482 --> 52:00.015
What?

52:00.050 --> 52:01.917
I throw like a girl
because I am a girl.

52:01.952 --> 52:03.853
Hannah throws like a girl, too.

52:03.887 --> 52:05.221
She's just good at it.

52:05.255 --> 52:06.956
Kimberly, that...
That's not what I meant.

52:06.990 --> 52:08.290
Why is it a compliment
every time you say

52:08.325 --> 52:09.625
I run like a boy,

52:09.659 --> 52:11.827
but an insult when you
say I run like a girl?

52:11.862 --> 52:14.130
Can't I just be a good
runner or a bad runner?

52:16.900 --> 52:18.033
You <i> are</i> a bad runner.

52:18.068 --> 52:19.635
I know that.

52:19.669 --> 52:21.937
Everyone knows that.
But it's not because
I'm a girl.

52:21.972 --> 52:23.906
It's because I'm
an uncoordinated dork

52:23.940 --> 52:25.107
like Marcus and Jordan.

52:25.142 --> 52:26.442
Both: Hey!

52:26.476 --> 52:28.544
The cougars' third
baseman can't throw,

52:28.578 --> 52:30.312
period.

52:33.884 --> 52:35.050
Ok.

52:35.085 --> 52:37.887
If there aren't any more
unresolved issues...

52:37.921 --> 52:39.855
My dad's a nurse.
What?

52:39.890 --> 52:42.324
You made fun of
the eagles' coach
for being a nurse.

52:42.359 --> 52:45.227
Oliver, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean anything...

52:45.262 --> 52:46.896
He saves people's lives.

52:46.930 --> 52:48.430
My father is a florist.

52:48.465 --> 52:49.932
And why do I have to be
one of the guys?

52:49.966 --> 52:51.667
Can't I just be
part of the team?

52:53.170 --> 52:55.104
Hey, what's everybody
standing around for?

52:55.138 --> 52:56.472
What are you doing here?

52:56.506 --> 52:58.107
I'm here to play some baseball.

52:58.141 --> 52:59.808
This is where
I'm supposed to be,

52:59.843 --> 53:01.043
right, dad?

53:01.077 --> 53:03.579
Well... right.

53:03.613 --> 53:04.446
Definitely right.

53:04.481 --> 53:06.315
And since that's settled,

53:06.349 --> 53:07.883
let's go
win ourselves
a ballgame!

53:07.918 --> 53:09.652
Yeah!

53:12.289 --> 53:14.190

for every time I heard that...

54:20.190 --> 54:21.790
I could pay
for these extra pizzas.

54:21.825 --> 54:24.326
Don't worry, boys and girls,
reinforcements have arrived.

54:24.361 --> 54:25.361
Hey!

54:26.863 --> 54:28.530
Good game.

54:28.565 --> 54:29.765
Thanks. You, too.

54:30.967 --> 54:33.035
Hi.
Hi.

54:33.069 --> 54:35.504
I'm sorry, I was
expecting the pizza guy.

54:35.538 --> 54:36.939
You're not him.

54:36.973 --> 54:38.374
Are you?

54:40.343 --> 54:42.711
Somebody wants her apron back!

54:49.085 --> 54:50.619
Well, I wish
we had something
we could offer you.

54:50.654 --> 54:52.221
Oh...

54:52.255 --> 54:53.222
Cookies?

54:53.256 --> 54:54.590
Ooh.

54:54.624 --> 54:55.624
Thank you.

54:59.696 --> 55:02.464
Eddie, you know why I'm here.

55:03.533 --> 55:05.701
You need to be at
that cook-off tomorrow.

55:05.735 --> 55:07.503
Oh, I can't.

55:07.537 --> 55:08.637
Why?

55:08.672 --> 55:11.206
The groundhogs
are in the playoffs.

55:12.642 --> 55:15.611
Oh, is that all?

55:15.645 --> 55:17.913
Boy, have you walked into
the wrong house. Heh.

55:17.947 --> 55:20.082
It's the biggest game
of the year,

55:20.116 --> 55:21.617
and everybody's counting on me.

55:21.651 --> 55:23.719
He's not gonna
let his team down,
Mrs. Hadley.

55:23.753 --> 55:26.555
No. Apparently
just himself.

55:27.691 --> 55:29.291
Look, you've got Bridget.

55:29.326 --> 55:30.092
She'll be great.

55:30.126 --> 55:31.593
Yeah. Bridget. Sure.

55:31.628 --> 55:32.695
She can...

55:32.729 --> 55:34.997
Whisk till the cows come home.

55:35.031 --> 55:36.732
But she has no passion,

55:36.766 --> 55:38.267
she has no...

55:38.301 --> 55:40.903
No instinct.

55:40.937 --> 55:43.572
But you, Eddie ogden, you are...

55:43.606 --> 55:45.541
You're a natural.

55:45.575 --> 55:46.709
It's...

55:46.743 --> 55:48.644
It's what you were born to do.

55:51.915 --> 55:54.616
That was a little
melodramatic, huh?

55:55.719 --> 55:56.852
Oh, I was afraid of that.

55:56.886 --> 55:58.654
That's what you get
for practicing

55:58.688 --> 55:59.955
in front of your cats.

56:01.458 --> 56:02.825
Well, alrighty, then,

56:02.859 --> 56:04.993
I gave it the old
cordon bleu try.

56:05.028 --> 56:07.029
Well, thanks for coming.

56:07.063 --> 56:08.464
And, uh, thanks for the cookies.

56:08.498 --> 56:09.598
They're amazing.

56:09.632 --> 56:10.632
Both: It's the ginger.

56:13.636 --> 56:16.305
You see, I'm sorry for all this,

56:16.339 --> 56:19.007
but it's just that Eddie,
he has so much potential,

56:19.042 --> 56:20.709
and I want him
to think long-term,

56:20.744 --> 56:22.211
and I know i shouldn't push...

56:22.245 --> 56:24.947
Oh, no, but sometimes
you... you have to.

56:25.815 --> 56:27.316
Yeah.

56:27.350 --> 56:29.218
Well, good-bye.

56:29.252 --> 56:31.453
Good-bye.
Thanks for coming,
Mrs. Hadley.

56:32.622 --> 56:33.922
Eddie.

56:33.957 --> 56:35.591
Could you do me just one favor?

56:35.625 --> 56:36.592
Sleep on it.

56:36.626 --> 56:39.528
Don't make your final
decision till tomorrow.

56:39.562 --> 56:41.463
Please? Just promise me.

56:41.498 --> 56:43.665
I promise.

56:43.700 --> 56:45.501
But, uh, if I know my son,

56:45.535 --> 56:47.669
I wouldn't count on it.

56:47.704 --> 56:51.206
Well, I'm sure
nobody knows him
better than you.

58:34.611 --> 58:36.278
Yes!

58:39.549 --> 58:41.617
Another home run for ogden?

58:41.651 --> 58:42.851
I think it is.

58:42.886 --> 58:44.052
It's high and long...

58:44.087 --> 58:45.754
Against the back fence,
and it's...

58:48.892 --> 58:50.359
Good!

59:51.454 --> 59:53.789
5, 4, 3, 2...

59:53.823 --> 59:56.525
Hi, everybody, I'm Bobby flay,

59:56.559 --> 59:58.827
and welcome to
the million dollar
cook-off!

59:58.861 --> 01:00:01.363
Today, 8 talented finalists

01:00:01.397 --> 01:00:04.099
will tantalize us with
spectacular dishes

01:00:04.133 --> 01:00:06.735
as they compete for
prizes and scholarships

01:00:06.769 --> 01:00:09.638
for the culinary schools
of their dreams.

01:00:09.672 --> 01:00:12.007
Nice, Bobby.
Good.

01:00:16.679 --> 01:00:20.248
Bridget: There's no blender!
I can't work without a blender!

01:00:20.283 --> 01:00:22.784
Mrs. Hadley: We need
a blender at station 2!

01:00:22.819 --> 01:00:24.386
Stat!

01:00:47.410 --> 01:00:48.543
Man: Eddie ogden.

01:00:49.679 --> 01:00:50.746
Yeah!

01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:52.614
Welcome, but, uh...
You better hustle

01:00:52.649 --> 01:00:54.650
and get yourself set up, here.

01:00:54.684 --> 01:00:57.019
Oh, I'm not staying.
I just kind of wanted
to see everything.

01:00:57.053 --> 01:00:58.253
It's so cool.

01:00:58.287 --> 01:00:59.554
What do you mean,
you're not staying?

01:00:59.589 --> 01:01:01.123
Oh, I've got a game.

01:01:01.157 --> 01:01:02.691
It's kind of hard to explain.

01:01:02.725 --> 01:01:03.859
You know, people are
counting on me,

01:01:03.893 --> 01:01:05.293
and my dad is...

01:01:05.328 --> 01:01:06.595
I think I get it.

01:01:06.629 --> 01:01:08.597
Well...

01:01:08.631 --> 01:01:09.631
Good luck.

01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:10.866
You'll be missed.

01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:11.867
Thanks.

01:01:11.901 --> 01:01:13.135
See ya.

01:01:13.169 --> 01:01:15.203
Hey...

01:01:15.238 --> 01:01:17.005
How do you crack an egg
with one hand?

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:19.508
Heh. You stick around
and I'll show you how.

01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:22.611
I'm gonna be late.
See ya.

01:01:22.645 --> 01:01:24.012
See ya.

01:01:24.047 --> 01:01:25.614
Mom: I don't know
where he is.

01:01:25.648 --> 01:01:26.848
Why are you blaming me?

01:01:26.883 --> 01:01:28.617
I'm sorry.
It's just...

01:01:28.651 --> 01:01:29.985
I don't know.

01:01:30.019 --> 01:01:31.687
I don't know who he is anymore.

01:01:31.721 --> 01:01:33.555
He doesn't tell me anything.

01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:35.090
He doesn't tell you,

01:01:35.124 --> 01:01:37.592
or he's telling
you things you just
don't want to hear?

01:01:37.627 --> 01:01:39.361
What's that supposed to mean?

01:01:39.395 --> 01:01:42.631
Hey, mom. Hey, dad.
Sorry I'm late.

01:01:42.665 --> 01:01:44.533
Ha ha! Yes!

01:01:49.906 --> 01:01:53.275
All: 1..2..3..
Go groundhogs! Yeah!

01:01:54.744 --> 01:01:55.711
You made the right decision.

01:01:55.745 --> 01:01:57.279
Now let's go get 'em, huh?

01:01:57.313 --> 01:02:00.415
Remember...
It's all about
beating the eagles.

01:02:00.450 --> 01:02:01.583
I remember.

01:02:05.755 --> 01:02:07.155
Hey, batter, batter,
batter, batter!

01:02:30.813 --> 01:02:32.314
Go get 'em.

01:02:33.649 --> 01:02:35.383
Go, Eddie!

01:02:40.289 --> 01:02:42.724
If it isn't
little Eddie Crocker.

01:02:42.759 --> 01:02:46.495
I thought you had
cupcakes to bake.

01:02:46.529 --> 01:02:49.364
Gee, you know, I'd love to sit
around and compare recipes,

01:02:49.398 --> 01:02:51.733
but...

01:02:51.768 --> 01:02:53.602
I've got some bases to run.

01:03:03.479 --> 01:03:05.647
Welcome back to the
million-dollar cook-off.

01:03:05.681 --> 01:03:07.048
We are just seconds away

01:03:07.083 --> 01:03:08.416
from seeing these 8...

01:03:09.485 --> 01:03:12.387
Well, actually,
7 young chefs in action.

01:03:12.421 --> 01:03:13.522
When I ring the bell,

01:03:13.556 --> 01:03:15.524
every contestant will
have exactly 2 hours

01:03:15.558 --> 01:03:17.959
to present the judges
with a complete meal,

01:03:17.994 --> 01:03:20.195
using the ingredients
you see here.

01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:23.131
Easy, easy, easy.

01:03:23.166 --> 01:03:25.300
And they also must use all 4

01:03:25.334 --> 01:03:26.935
of today's secret ingredients...

01:03:26.969 --> 01:03:29.671
Chocolate, chicken, lemons,

01:03:29.705 --> 01:03:31.406
and check this out...

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:33.275
Red-hot chili peppers.

01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:34.709
Ok, not so easy.

01:03:34.744 --> 01:03:35.877
But I bet you Eddie could win it

01:03:35.912 --> 01:03:37.312
using nothing more
than a pickle fork

01:03:37.346 --> 01:03:39.414
and a bunsen burner.
Right, Eddie?

01:03:46.622 --> 01:03:47.856
Why are you watching that?

01:03:47.890 --> 01:03:49.991
Well, Eddie might not be on TV,

01:03:50.026 --> 01:03:51.059
but his name was.

01:03:51.093 --> 01:03:52.494
That's pretty cool.

01:03:52.528 --> 01:03:54.208
Go, Eddie.
Eye on the ball.
Eye on the ball.

01:03:55.932 --> 01:03:56.898
Umpire: Strike one!

01:03:56.933 --> 01:03:58.667
If it was that cool,

01:03:58.701 --> 01:04:00.569
he'd be there.

01:04:00.603 --> 01:04:01.603
Ok, Eddie.

01:04:01.637 --> 01:04:03.572
Focus, Eddie. Focus.

01:04:03.606 --> 01:04:05.140
So, on your mark...

01:04:07.944 --> 01:04:08.910
Umpire: Strike 2!

01:04:08.945 --> 01:04:10.378
Get set...

01:04:11.848 --> 01:04:14.449
Strike 3!
You're out!

01:04:14.483 --> 01:04:16.184
Cook!

01:04:16.219 --> 01:04:17.619
Cook-off announcer:
And they're off.

01:04:17.653 --> 01:04:21.890
The is the scariest
and most exciting time
for these youngsters...

01:04:21.924 --> 01:04:23.892
Turn that off.

01:04:23.926 --> 01:04:26.361
Game announcer: And at
the end of 2 innings,

01:04:26.395 --> 01:04:28.563
the score is tied 3-3.

01:04:34.604 --> 01:04:37.172
All right, come on, groundhogs!
Let's go! Easy out!

01:04:43.646 --> 01:04:44.880
Safe!

01:04:44.914 --> 01:04:46.581
Off the bag.

01:04:49.852 --> 01:04:52.520
Announcer: Eagles lead 4-3.

01:04:55.758 --> 01:04:58.093
Ok, groundhogs,
focus, focus, focus!

01:04:58.127 --> 01:04:59.861
Eddie, get in the game!

01:04:59.896 --> 01:05:01.263
Get in the game!

01:05:08.004 --> 01:05:10.338
All right, come on,
Jordan! Let's go!

01:05:10.373 --> 01:05:13.141
Ok, come on.
Eye on the ball!
Eye on the ball!

01:05:13.175 --> 01:05:14.175
What's wrong with Eddie?

01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:15.844
We've never seen him
play this bad.

01:05:15.878 --> 01:05:17.579
Yeah, he better
pull himself together.

01:05:17.613 --> 01:05:18.914
Or what?

01:05:18.948 --> 01:05:20.682
What do you mean, or what?

01:05:20.716 --> 01:05:24.319
Or we're gonna lose,
that's or what.

01:05:24.353 --> 01:05:26.488
And turn that off.
I don't think your
cook-off play-by-plays

01:05:26.522 --> 01:05:27.923
are helping.

01:05:27.957 --> 01:05:29.691
Well, I don't
think that you
making him choose

01:05:29.725 --> 01:05:31.426
between cooking
and having friends

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:32.894
is helping, either, db.

01:05:32.929 --> 01:05:35.196
What? Now you've
completely lost it.

01:05:35.231 --> 01:05:36.398
See, this is what happens

01:05:36.432 --> 01:05:37.832
when you forget to wear
a batting helmet.

01:05:37.867 --> 01:05:40.068
Umpire: Strike one!

01:05:40.102 --> 01:05:41.436
All right, Jordan, let's go!

01:05:41.470 --> 01:05:43.204
Eddie's here because
he wants to be here.

01:05:43.239 --> 01:05:44.906
Because he wants
to beat the eagles.

01:05:44.941 --> 01:05:46.808
Is that why you're here?

01:05:46.842 --> 01:05:48.410
No, I'm here because
i love baseball.

01:05:48.444 --> 01:05:50.345
Yeah, kind of like
Eddie and cooking, huh?

01:05:55.685 --> 01:05:56.851
Yeah!

01:05:59.088 --> 01:06:00.622
All right! I'll just
hit Jordan home

01:06:00.656 --> 01:06:01.656
and we're back in this.

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.594
But without Eddie, we can't win.

01:06:15.438 --> 01:06:16.438
Dad:
Let's go, Eddie!

01:06:18.674 --> 01:06:20.175
Oh, man.

01:06:22.378 --> 01:06:23.645
Hey, ogden.

01:06:23.679 --> 01:06:26.348
Why is it always up to you?

01:06:26.382 --> 01:06:27.649
What?

01:06:27.683 --> 01:06:29.117
"Eddie, hit a home run."

01:06:29.151 --> 01:06:31.486
"Eddie, make that play.
Eddie, save us."

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:33.388
Why don't you let us
do it for a change?

01:06:34.991 --> 01:06:36.691
Do we want to say
Eddie did this for us

01:06:36.726 --> 01:06:38.059
or that we won it for ourselves?

01:06:39.862 --> 01:06:41.629
Hey, I'm just trying to help.

01:06:41.664 --> 01:06:44.099
Help? We don't
need your help.

01:06:44.133 --> 01:06:46.001
We don't want your help.
In fact, we don't want you.

01:06:46.035 --> 01:06:48.303
You're better off
baking some pies

01:06:48.337 --> 01:06:49.971
at some stupid contest
than here.

01:06:51.607 --> 01:06:52.574
All right?

01:06:52.608 --> 01:06:53.608
All: Right!

01:06:53.642 --> 01:06:56.011
So go.

01:06:57.279 --> 01:06:58.279
You go do what you have to do

01:06:58.314 --> 01:07:00.148
and let us do
what we have to do.

01:07:01.884 --> 01:07:04.519
Batter up!

01:07:05.855 --> 01:07:06.955
Help me out here, guys.

01:07:06.989 --> 01:07:08.990
All: Go!
Get out of here!

01:07:10.659 --> 01:07:12.193
So you guys are really cool?

01:07:13.529 --> 01:07:15.196
Oh, give me that.
You're not the only one

01:07:15.231 --> 01:07:17.032
who can hit in a couple of runs.

01:07:35.551 --> 01:07:36.918
Yeah!

01:07:40.623 --> 01:07:41.623
See?

01:07:41.657 --> 01:07:42.657
Kimberly, run! Go!

01:08:06.649 --> 01:08:07.615
So you going, or what?

01:08:07.650 --> 01:08:09.217
I'm going.

01:08:09.251 --> 01:08:11.619
I think I should
have about an hour
and a half left.

01:08:11.654 --> 01:08:13.221
Wish me luck.
All right.

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:18.493
So, what?

01:08:18.527 --> 01:08:19.594
That's it?

01:08:19.627 --> 01:08:20.895
You're quitting?

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:23.198
No, I'm not quitting.
I'm starting.

01:08:26.001 --> 01:08:28.169
You wouldn't understand.
I gotta go.

01:08:31.474 --> 01:08:33.808
You'll get there quicker
if I drive you.

01:08:33.843 --> 01:08:34.809
Thanks.

01:08:34.844 --> 01:08:36.044
Eddie!

01:08:37.179 --> 01:08:38.880
Good thing the eagles'
coach is a nurse,

01:08:38.913 --> 01:08:41.349
'cause I think Mr. ogden's
gonna need one.

01:08:55.247 --> 01:08:57.247
Uh-oh. Looks like
a late entry
has just arrived!

01:08:57.283 --> 01:08:58.316
Come on!

01:09:02.621 --> 01:09:04.889
What? No fair!

01:09:04.924 --> 01:09:06.224
He can't do that!

01:09:06.258 --> 01:09:07.658
Can he do that?

01:09:11.397 --> 01:09:14.532
Welcome back, Eddie,
but you know, we can't
give you any more time.

01:09:14.567 --> 01:09:16.901
There's only an hour
and 3 minutes left.

01:09:16.935 --> 01:09:18.569
I can do it!

01:09:29.014 --> 01:09:31.049
Oh! See? I can't get him
to clean the bathroom,

01:09:31.082 --> 01:09:32.843
but he'll stick his hand
up a chicken's butt.

01:09:35.955 --> 01:09:40.992
At the end of 3 1/2,
eagles 6, groundhogs 4.

01:09:51.203 --> 01:09:55.206
So, at the end of 4,
eagles 6, groundhogs 5.

01:10:20.266 --> 01:10:23.301
We're at the 30-minute
point and cutting it close.

01:10:23.335 --> 01:10:26.237
Eddie ogden is coming on strong.

01:10:31.343 --> 01:10:34.579
Well, folks, the groundhogs
are really putting up a fight.

01:10:34.613 --> 01:10:38.216
At the end of 5,
eagles lead 8-6.

01:10:39.351 --> 01:10:40.485
Good job.

01:10:40.519 --> 01:10:41.719
Good job.

01:10:41.754 --> 01:10:43.855
You're up.
You're up.

01:10:43.889 --> 01:10:45.890
Cook-off announcer:
This is where the lack of time

01:10:45.925 --> 01:10:48.826
is really gonna hurt him.
There is no room
for mistakes.

01:10:50.396 --> 01:10:52.230
Eddie: Ok, don't panic.

01:10:52.264 --> 01:10:55.366
Chocolate tarts
instead of chocolate pie.

01:10:55.401 --> 01:10:57.268
Problem solved.

01:11:03.876 --> 01:11:07.211
Strike 3!
You're outta here!

01:11:07.246 --> 01:11:09.213
Longo: That's
all right, db.

01:11:09.248 --> 01:11:12.016
All right.
Good job.

01:11:16.055 --> 01:11:17.288
Come on, Eddie!

01:11:17.323 --> 01:11:18.523
What's the matter?

01:11:18.557 --> 01:11:19.891
It looks bad.
He's rushing.

01:11:19.925 --> 01:11:21.559
I don't think he
has enough time.

01:11:21.593 --> 01:11:23.461
Batter up!

01:11:32.237 --> 01:11:34.672
Man... One of us
should've gone
to help him.

01:11:34.707 --> 01:11:37.275
Everyone else has
people helping them.

01:11:37.309 --> 01:11:38.676
Hank!

01:11:38.711 --> 01:11:41.379
Uh, yeah. Sorry.

01:11:41.413 --> 01:11:42.447
Hannah, you're up!

01:11:42.481 --> 01:11:44.182
Get out there, Hannah!
Let's do it!

01:11:44.216 --> 01:11:45.383
Whoo!

01:11:45.417 --> 01:11:49.320
All right.
Bases loaded, 2 outs.

01:11:49.355 --> 01:11:50.355
You're the man!

01:11:50.389 --> 01:11:51.289
Uh... girl...
I mean...

01:11:51.323 --> 01:11:53.157
It's ok.

01:11:54.727 --> 01:11:57.428
Oh, no! It's my mom!

01:11:57.463 --> 01:12:00.565
No! Hannah, we can't
do this now!

01:12:03.068 --> 01:12:05.036
I said, ♪ hey, hey ♪

01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:06.471
♪ what do I say ♪

01:12:06.505 --> 01:12:08.172
♪ come on, groundhogs,
time to play ♪

01:12:08.207 --> 01:12:09.240
Yeah! Groundhogs rock!

01:12:09.274 --> 01:12:10.274
Hannah...

01:12:10.309 --> 01:12:12.143
Oh, hey, mom.

01:12:12.177 --> 01:12:14.445
Your forgot
your pom-poms.

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:16.914
Oh. Thanks
for bringing them.

01:12:16.949 --> 01:12:18.182
See you at home.

01:12:18.217 --> 01:12:19.217
Umpire: Groundhogs!

01:12:21.987 --> 01:12:23.221
I... Hannah!

01:12:32.297 --> 01:12:35.366
Mom, I'm not a cheerleader,
I've never been a cheerleader,

01:12:35.401 --> 01:12:36.834
nor will I ever be one.

01:12:39.171 --> 01:12:42.006
But I am one of the best
shortstops in the league,

01:12:42.041 --> 01:12:44.201
and a decent batter
when I remember
to keep my elbow up.

01:12:45.511 --> 01:12:47.111
You and can rant
and scream all you want,

01:12:47.146 --> 01:12:49.981
but it's gonna have
to wait until after I bat.

01:12:54.686 --> 01:12:57.455
Well, then you'll
probably need this.

01:12:57.489 --> 01:12:59.891
My batting glove?

01:12:59.925 --> 01:13:02.727
I found it
in your jeans
this morning.

01:13:02.761 --> 01:13:05.797
Hannah, honey,
I'm only
disappointed

01:13:05.831 --> 01:13:07.432
that you thought
that I wouldn't
support you

01:13:07.466 --> 01:13:09.067
doing something that you love.

01:13:09.101 --> 01:13:10.568
Final warning!

01:13:12.337 --> 01:13:14.906
Really?
So you don't mind?

01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:17.575
No. But we'll talk
after the game.

01:13:17.609 --> 01:13:19.510
Right now...

01:13:19.545 --> 01:13:21.245
Go show your mother
what you can do!

01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:24.082
Thanks, mom.

01:13:24.116 --> 01:13:26.150
Go!

01:13:28.187 --> 01:13:29.620
Go get 'em.

01:13:37.096 --> 01:13:38.830
Umpire: Strike one!

01:13:38.864 --> 01:13:41.199
All right, Hannah!
That's the way to play!

01:13:41.233 --> 01:13:42.600
Wait for your pitch!

01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:49.107
Ball!

01:13:49.141 --> 01:13:50.708
All right, Hannah!

01:13:54.346 --> 01:13:56.214
Hank: What are you...

01:13:56.248 --> 01:13:58.149
Sleeping out here?

01:13:58.183 --> 01:14:01.185
You've been calling balls
strikes, strikes balls.
Do you have any idea

01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:02.687
what those words actually mean?

01:14:02.721 --> 01:14:05.690
Now, that last call
was in your favor.

01:14:05.724 --> 01:14:08.292
Well, maybe, if you'd
keep your eyes open
for a change,

01:14:08.327 --> 01:14:09.994
we'd get some decent calls!

01:14:10.028 --> 01:14:11.829
There's no reason
for you to go...

01:14:11.864 --> 01:14:13.564
There's no reason
that these kids,

01:14:13.599 --> 01:14:16.000
who have worked so long
and so hard, should lose

01:14:16.034 --> 01:14:19.971
because some screw-up
doesn't know the first thing
about baseball!

01:14:20.005 --> 01:14:22.340
I swear,
one more word
out of you,

01:14:22.374 --> 01:14:23.374
and you're out of this game.

01:14:23.408 --> 01:14:25.209
Oh, yeah?

01:14:31.283 --> 01:14:32.650
I dare you!

01:14:32.684 --> 01:14:35.453
That's 3!
You are outta here!

01:14:35.487 --> 01:14:37.722
No problem.

01:14:37.756 --> 01:14:40.324
Hannah, keep your elbow up.

01:14:40.359 --> 01:14:42.860
Go, groundhogs!

01:14:48.367 --> 01:14:49.734
Announcer: It looks like ogden

01:14:49.768 --> 01:14:52.303
is finally getting
some reinforcements.

01:14:52.337 --> 01:14:55.540
I don't know when I've seen
so many pairs of cleats
in the kitchen.

01:14:55.574 --> 01:14:58.209
Dad, what are you doing here?

01:14:59.745 --> 01:15:01.512
Well, I figure
this means so much
to you

01:15:01.547 --> 01:15:02.513
that I must be
missing something.

01:15:02.548 --> 01:15:03.681
So maybe you can show me

01:15:03.715 --> 01:15:06.450
why it's so important to you.

01:15:06.485 --> 01:15:08.252
Now?
Now? No.

01:15:08.287 --> 01:15:09.921
Not now. Later.

01:15:09.955 --> 01:15:12.690
Now, I just thought
maybe you could use
a little help.

01:15:12.724 --> 01:15:14.392
Well, all I've got
is a burnt pie

01:15:14.426 --> 01:15:15.693
and a bubbling pot of chocolate,

01:15:15.727 --> 01:15:17.328
so, yeah, I could use
a lot of help.

01:15:17.362 --> 01:15:20.031
Ok. So, just tell me
what to do, coach.

01:15:20.065 --> 01:15:22.600
Ok. I'll chop these,

01:15:22.634 --> 01:15:24.769
you crack a couple
of those eggs
into that bowl.

01:15:41.386 --> 01:15:44.088
What? Aren't
i doing it right?

01:16:12.251 --> 01:16:13.251
Strike!

01:16:49.254 --> 01:16:50.588
Eddie, less than 2 minutes.

01:16:55.193 --> 01:16:59.230
I swear, if that meringue
doesn't set up,
your life is over!

01:16:59.264 --> 01:17:00.431
All right.
Put the peppers on.

01:17:00.465 --> 01:17:02.333
Where?
On the chocolate?

01:17:02.367 --> 01:17:04.201
Yeah. Hurry.
Eddie, whoever
heard of...

01:17:04.236 --> 01:17:05.770
Dad!
Ok!

01:17:05.804 --> 01:17:07.805
Announcer: Well, folks,
this is it,

01:17:07.839 --> 01:17:09.173
the groundhogs' last chance.

01:17:09.207 --> 01:17:12.276
With 2 outs and 2 on
and a winning run
at the plate,

01:17:12.311 --> 01:17:14.612
and the eagles
leading 8-6.

01:17:14.646 --> 01:17:17.148
Let's go, db!

01:17:18.817 --> 01:17:19.850
Easy out!

01:17:23.322 --> 01:17:26.123
You got to hit
a triple to tie
and a homerun to win.

01:17:26.158 --> 01:17:28.292
There's no way you're
even making it to first.

01:17:28.327 --> 01:17:29.527
Oh, yeah?
Just watch me.

01:17:29.561 --> 01:17:32.330
Strike one!

01:17:32.364 --> 01:17:34.265
Aah! It's ok!
It's all right.

01:17:34.299 --> 01:17:36.667
Hey! I'm talking!

01:17:36.702 --> 01:17:38.536
Can't you see
he's trying
to distract me?

01:17:40.972 --> 01:17:42.606
Strike 2!

01:17:42.641 --> 01:17:44.809
All: Come on, db,
pay attention!

01:17:47.713 --> 01:17:49.613
Eddie, less than 30 seconds.

01:17:49.648 --> 01:17:51.015
Chocolate chicken?

01:17:51.049 --> 01:17:52.550
I think he's lost it.

01:17:52.584 --> 01:17:56.220
No, no, no, no, no.
It's molé.

01:17:56.254 --> 01:17:58.856
And chicken wrapped in bacon
has just hit the table.

01:17:58.890 --> 01:18:00.191
It sure smells like a winner.

01:18:04.029 --> 01:18:05.629
Dad, get
the lemon custard
out of the fridge.

01:18:05.664 --> 01:18:07.231
Boys, chanting:
Eddie! Eddie!

01:18:07.265 --> 01:18:10.835
Eddie, Eddie...

01:18:13.872 --> 01:18:15.373
With not a moment to spare,

01:18:15.407 --> 01:18:18.142
chicken molé
makes a welcome appearance.

01:18:18.176 --> 01:18:19.844
Dad, come on!
15 seconds!

01:18:19.878 --> 01:18:22.113
Eddie, this lemon thing...

01:18:22.147 --> 01:18:23.481
It didn't set?

01:18:23.515 --> 01:18:24.782
All right, not enough time.

01:18:24.816 --> 01:18:26.183
Uh...

01:18:28.353 --> 01:18:31.655
Bring it home, David!
Bring it home!

01:18:37.329 --> 01:18:38.362
You don't have lemon.

01:18:38.397 --> 01:18:39.663
You're supposed
to have something
with lemon.

01:18:39.698 --> 01:18:41.699
Crowd: 10, 9...

01:18:41.733 --> 01:18:43.134
Dad!

01:18:43.168 --> 01:18:44.435
7, 6...

01:18:44.469 --> 01:18:47.204
5, 4...

01:18:50.242 --> 01:18:52.810
3, 2, 1!

01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:57.181
There! I got lemon!

01:18:57.215 --> 01:18:59.183
Yeah, all right!

01:18:59.217 --> 01:19:00.217
Yes!

01:19:01.253 --> 01:19:02.253
Time's up.

01:19:07.793 --> 01:19:08.926
Loser...

01:19:10.529 --> 01:19:11.729
All: Run!

01:19:16.301 --> 01:19:18.102
Frankie:
Coming through!

01:19:30.015 --> 01:19:31.115
Umpire: Safe!

01:19:31.149 --> 01:19:32.216
Announcer: Unbelievable!

01:19:32.250 --> 01:19:33.284
All tied up!

01:19:52.437 --> 01:19:54.939
Bobby: Now, before
we announce the winner,

01:19:54.973 --> 01:19:58.342
I would just like to say,
this has been
one tough competition.

01:19:58.376 --> 01:20:01.245
You demonstrated
your creativity,

01:20:01.279 --> 01:20:02.613
you showed us your passion,

01:20:02.647 --> 01:20:04.381
and a future at the stove

01:20:04.416 --> 01:20:06.183
is bright for each
and every one of you.

01:20:06.218 --> 01:20:09.286
Today alone has been
one amazing achievement.

01:20:09.321 --> 01:20:11.689
And now, the winner...

01:20:11.723 --> 01:20:14.558
Of the one-million-dollar
scholastic cook-off...

01:20:18.463 --> 01:20:20.998
Is Bridget Simmons!

01:20:23.502 --> 01:20:25.102
Safe!

01:20:25.136 --> 01:20:26.670
Simons!

01:20:31.142 --> 01:20:32.977
Yes!
I won, I won!

01:21:15.353 --> 01:21:16.554
Well, that's it.

01:21:16.588 --> 01:21:17.888
Thanks for watching, everybody,

01:21:17.923 --> 01:21:19.423
and until next year,
I'm Bobby flay

01:21:19.457 --> 01:21:21.325
for the million-dollar
cook-off.

01:21:23.361 --> 01:21:26.730
Eddie...
I'm sorry.

01:21:26.765 --> 01:21:30.834
Don't worry, dad.
It's no big deal.

01:21:30.869 --> 01:21:32.736
Eddie...

01:21:40.545 --> 01:21:41.712
Hey, what happened?

01:21:41.746 --> 01:21:43.113
Well, Bridget creamed him

01:21:43.148 --> 01:21:45.249
with her lemon meringue
angel food pie.

01:21:54.159 --> 01:21:56.894
Come on, sport,
you gave it
your best shot.

01:21:56.928 --> 01:21:59.330
Yeah, but I struck out.

01:21:59.364 --> 01:22:00.764
You didn't strike out.

01:22:00.799 --> 01:22:02.566
Bridget just hit it
out of the park.

01:22:04.336 --> 01:22:06.503
Either way, I lost.

01:22:06.538 --> 01:22:09.173
Hey, Eddie, come on.

01:22:09.207 --> 01:22:10.207
What a game, huh?

01:22:11.810 --> 01:22:13.777
This wasn't about you winning.

01:22:13.812 --> 01:22:16.580
It was about you
doing something
that you love.

01:22:16.615 --> 01:22:19.249
And you know what?

01:22:19.284 --> 01:22:21.352
You're really good at it.

01:22:21.386 --> 01:22:23.821
You're a kid with
a lot of gifts,

01:22:23.855 --> 01:22:27.591
and a lifetime to
sort them out, so...

01:22:27.626 --> 01:22:30.594
Cook, play baseball,
take up
lawn bowling...

01:22:30.629 --> 01:22:32.596
That's something else
i don't understand.

01:22:34.265 --> 01:22:37.534
Just remember, win or lose...

01:22:37.569 --> 01:22:39.637
I'm always on your team.

01:22:52.417 --> 01:22:55.252
Hey, we heard
the news, man. Sorry.

01:22:55.286 --> 01:22:56.286
It's ok.

01:22:57.322 --> 01:22:58.989
I'm cool.

01:22:59.024 --> 01:23:00.924
And you know what they say...
If you can't take the heat...

01:23:00.959 --> 01:23:02.726
All: Stay out
of the kitchen.

01:23:03.962 --> 01:23:06.030
Look, guys...

01:23:06.064 --> 01:23:07.798
I'm really sorry
if I let you down.

01:23:07.832 --> 01:23:09.266
Yeah.

01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:12.436
For once, we actually
had to rely on ourselves.

01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:13.404
And guess what...

01:23:13.438 --> 01:23:14.438
All: We won!

01:23:19.844 --> 01:23:21.045
Hey, you!

01:23:21.079 --> 01:23:22.046
Big-time chef
guy...

01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:23.013
Yeah?
Everybody says

01:23:23.048 --> 01:23:24.415
you know everything about food.

01:23:24.449 --> 01:23:26.216
Well, here's something
that you don't know.

01:23:26.251 --> 01:23:27.251
Eddie ogden is the best cook

01:23:27.285 --> 01:23:29.319
in this whole
dumb cook-off,
and you know it.

01:23:29.354 --> 01:23:30.354
Hey, no arguments here.

01:23:32.257 --> 01:23:33.824
So, why didn't he win?

01:23:33.858 --> 01:23:36.360
Why isn't he holding
up the trophy,
doing the rocky dance?

01:23:36.394 --> 01:23:38.862
Check him out.
Come on, check him out.

01:23:39.931 --> 01:23:42.232
He looks like a winner to me.

01:23:44.335 --> 01:23:45.936
I feel you, man.

01:23:45.970 --> 01:23:47.237
All right.

01:23:47.272 --> 01:23:50.274
So, who wants to celebrate?

01:23:50.308 --> 01:23:51.542
Let's go get something to eat.

01:23:51.576 --> 01:23:53.077
Eddie dogs?

01:23:53.111 --> 01:23:54.712
All: Yeah!

01:23:54.746 --> 01:23:58.148
Eddie! Eddie! Eddie! Eddie...

01:23:58.183 --> 01:23:59.917
Hey, what about me?

01:24:01.553 --> 01:24:04.021
I'm the winner.
I'm hungry, too.
