00:01.200 --> 00:02.270
- Previously on Being Human...

00:03.870 --> 00:05.360
The spell that
brought me back,

00:05.400 --> 00:06.799
I don't think
it lasts forever.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.797
I think I'm dying again.

00:10.170 --> 00:11.660
(Cat yowling)

00:13.610 --> 00:15.169
- He sustains me
till he's 18,

00:15.210 --> 00:18.043
and then,
I give him his fangs.

00:18.080 --> 00:19.639
- I've agreed
to turn Kenny.

00:19.680 --> 00:22.115
- I thought you didn't want
to father more sons.

00:22.150 --> 00:24.312
- I'm willing to do it
to protect him from you.

00:24.350 --> 00:27.320
- This sickness, what is it?
It's in the blood, right?

00:27.360 --> 00:29.385
After the lesions,
it takes 2-3 days.

00:29.430 --> 00:30.420
- Thank you.

00:30.460 --> 00:32.121
- Kat's one of
my closest friends.

00:32.159 --> 00:34.128
Stay away from her, Aidan.

00:34.160 --> 00:36.492
- At last we meet.
Liam McLean.

00:36.530 --> 00:39.591
- I killed his daughter.
- What happened to Brynn?

00:39.640 --> 00:40.766
- What is that?

00:40.800 --> 00:42.802
- Blood, infected
with the virus.

00:42.840 --> 00:45.309
- I killed her.
Ah!

00:46.440 --> 00:48.078
- (Josh): No!

00:48.110 --> 00:49.805
Go! Go, go, go!

00:49.850 --> 00:51.079
(Snarling)

00:52.850 --> 00:55.069
Aaah! Ah!

00:57.520 --> 00:59.284
(Birds chirping)

01:10.370 --> 01:13.931
- Now, you be good to your
mother while I am gone, Isaac.

01:22.610 --> 01:24.647
(Sniffling)

01:32.890 --> 01:35.416
- Please...
Don't go.

01:37.990 --> 01:40.322
- I will return.

01:40.360 --> 01:41.657
I promise.

02:03.790 --> 02:06.282
(Coughing, moaning)

02:07.960 --> 02:10.179
(Footsteps approaching)

02:11.590 --> 02:13.354
- Hey.

02:14.930 --> 02:16.659
- Hi. What's that?

02:16.700 --> 02:18.896
- Uh, I thought that
I'd buy groceries

02:18.930 --> 02:21.592
and feed you,
for a change.

02:22.840 --> 02:24.638
I may have devoured everything
in the kitchen last night.

02:24.670 --> 02:26.308
- There she is.

02:26.340 --> 02:29.002
- So for you, Josh...

02:29.950 --> 02:33.147
Spinach omelette,
chicken sausage.

02:33.180 --> 02:35.512
Holla at ya, boy.

02:36.350 --> 02:40.059
And for you, Aidan,
bubble blood.

02:40.090 --> 02:41.410
Bon appetit!

02:41.460 --> 02:43.349
Yeah!

02:49.100 --> 02:51.319
- All right. Enough.

02:52.130 --> 02:53.461
(Moans)

02:53.500 --> 02:56.265
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to work.

02:56.310 --> 02:58.529
- Work? Is that wise?

02:58.570 --> 03:01.676
You only have, like,
a couple days left.

03:01.710 --> 03:03.701
- And I refuse to
spend them moping here.

03:03.750 --> 03:06.344
- So fluorescent lighting
and incontinent people

03:06.380 --> 03:07.814
are a better alternative?

03:07.850 --> 03:09.841
- Look, I feel OK.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.745
Really.

03:11.790 --> 03:13.679
What I want now is just, uh...

03:14.790 --> 03:16.053
(Sighs)

03:16.090 --> 03:18.821
One more day of being normal.

03:18.860 --> 03:20.794
Working is exactly what I need.

03:20.830 --> 03:23.720
- I'm not sure how patients will
react to being administered

03:23.770 --> 03:26.262
by a man with lesions
on his face.

03:34.310 --> 03:36.574
- I could help with that.

03:41.020 --> 03:43.239
(Phone ringing in receiver)

03:43.290 --> 03:45.247
- (Nora): Hi, it's me.
Not here.

03:45.290 --> 03:47.509
Leave a message after the beep.

04:06.040 --> 04:08.839
(Man humming)

04:10.250 --> 04:11.740
- Oh, God!

04:11.780 --> 04:12.815
- Oh, hello!

04:12.850 --> 04:15.012
- I'm--I'm so sorry,
I didn't mean--

04:15.050 --> 04:16.688
- A beautiful
morning to you.

04:17.690 --> 04:19.488
Name's Pete.

04:19.519 --> 04:20.714
- Nora.

04:21.560 --> 04:23.585
- I've gotta hand it
to you, Nora.

04:23.630 --> 04:25.450
Tying that meat
to the branch?

04:25.490 --> 04:27.697
Very cool.
- Ha!

04:27.730 --> 04:29.698
- Personally,
I'm a vegetarian,

04:29.730 --> 04:31.698
but my wolf spent
a good part of the night

04:31.730 --> 04:33.937
howling at that thing,
right alongside you.

04:33.970 --> 04:35.199
(Chuckles)

04:36.200 --> 04:38.806
- You're a--
- Vegetarian? Yeah.

04:38.840 --> 04:40.808
Apple cheddar sammy?

04:42.140 --> 04:43.642
- No thanks!

04:43.680 --> 04:46.615
I'm good.
Thank you, though.

04:48.520 --> 04:50.648
- I really appreciate this.
- Well, of course.

04:50.690 --> 04:53.455
I'm not gonna just let you
rot away in front of us.

04:53.490 --> 04:55.584
You deserve better.
- Maybe.

04:56.390 --> 04:57.949
- Hey. None of that.

04:57.990 --> 04:59.458
(Coughs)

04:59.500 --> 05:01.628
- When you come back,
you're taking my room.

05:01.660 --> 05:05.392
I'm not gonna watch you shrivel
away in that basement hovel, OK?

05:05.430 --> 05:07.569
(Chuckles, sniffs)

05:07.600 --> 05:09.193
There.

05:09.240 --> 05:11.163
- Do you...
Do you smell something?

05:11.210 --> 05:13.201
- No.

05:13.240 --> 05:16.847
Uh, OK, so I tried to match
your skin tone as best I could,

05:16.880 --> 05:18.769
but the kit doesn't
have "pasty white."

05:18.810 --> 05:22.383
You know, these hues are for
making dead people look alive.

05:24.350 --> 05:25.784
- It'll do.

05:32.330 --> 05:33.889
Thank you.

05:42.910 --> 05:44.366
(Exhales)

05:51.280 --> 05:52.748
(Gasps)

05:53.820 --> 05:55.413
- Ah...

06:04.060 --> 06:05.653
(Gasping)

06:11.070 --> 06:13.061
(Whimpering)

06:28.680 --> 06:30.717
- I heard there were a lot more
of us in the Boston area,

06:30.750 --> 06:33.879
so I figured I'd stop by,
check out the scene,

06:33.920 --> 06:35.410
make a friend or two.

06:35.460 --> 06:38.157
Personally, I'm not a fan
of the rules and regulations

06:38.190 --> 06:40.158
of pack mentality.

06:40.200 --> 06:42.669
Wolves think clearer
when we're alone.

06:43.930 --> 06:45.068
- Really?

06:45.100 --> 06:46.761
- Sure, wolves are
only in packs

06:46.800 --> 06:49.189
when they're bonded
by blood or love.

06:49.240 --> 06:52.505
But, hey, if that's
your thing,

06:52.540 --> 06:54.008
go for it.

06:54.040 --> 06:57.647
- You know what, I'm sorry,
but I really have to go.

06:57.680 --> 07:00.274
Can I give you
a ride somewhere?

07:00.320 --> 07:03.915
- No, I'm good.
That, right there?

07:03.950 --> 07:05.611
That's home.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.089
- Oh.

07:08.120 --> 07:10.521
- You think
it's sad, don't you?

07:10.560 --> 07:11.686
- No.

07:11.730 --> 07:12.856
- Mmm?

07:12.900 --> 07:14.095
Oh! Here.

07:14.130 --> 07:15.928
- You know what?
You can, uh...

07:15.960 --> 07:17.291
You can keep it.

07:17.330 --> 07:18.798
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

07:18.830 --> 07:20.229
- Thank you.

07:20.270 --> 07:22.193
- You're welcome.

07:22.240 --> 07:23.639
(Sirens wailing)

07:27.880 --> 07:29.746
(Aidan clears throat)

07:29.780 --> 07:31.100
(Sighs)

07:31.150 --> 07:34.347
- OK, I understand that
you don't get a lot of sun,

07:34.380 --> 07:36.018
but you're, like,
translucent.

07:36.050 --> 07:38.109
(Chuckles, clears throat)

07:38.150 --> 07:40.050
(Sighs)

07:40.090 --> 07:41.455
Wait a second.

07:41.490 --> 07:43.356
You got that virus?

07:45.990 --> 07:47.424
But how?

07:47.460 --> 07:49.690
I--I mean, you--you only
took blood from me

07:49.730 --> 07:53.064
and you were so careful
about the whole thing.

07:53.100 --> 07:54.864
- I wasn't careful enough.

07:56.610 --> 07:58.430
Kenny...

07:58.470 --> 08:01.440
I won't be able to keep up
my end of the bargain.

08:01.480 --> 08:03.005
- OK, then you have
to do it now.

08:03.050 --> 08:05.849
Turn me now, because with
my clean blood, I--I don't know,

08:05.880 --> 08:08.042
I'll probably heal you,
and we'll figure it out.

08:08.080 --> 08:10.981
- Uh-uh. No. It's not
worth the risk to you.

08:11.020 --> 08:12.658
Not with this virus.

08:12.690 --> 08:14.010
Either way,
can't you see?

08:14.060 --> 08:16.119
This life wouldn't
have been good for you.

08:16.160 --> 08:17.855
- No, no!
Please don't go, Aidan!

08:17.890 --> 08:19.927
Aidan, don't go. Please.

08:21.800 --> 08:24.428
I can't live
like this anymore.

08:24.470 --> 08:26.029
I have to get out of here!

08:26.070 --> 08:27.333
Please...

08:27.370 --> 08:29.236
Please.

08:32.370 --> 08:34.679
- Goodbye, Kenny.
- What?

08:46.450 --> 08:49.249
(Mouse trap snaps,
mouse squeals)

09:21.720 --> 09:24.087
- Hey, did we finally get one?

09:24.130 --> 09:25.620
- No, um...

09:25.660 --> 09:28.630
No, the cheese was moldy.
I mean, like, not the good kind.

09:28.660 --> 09:32.665
I mean, even mice deserve
a good meal before they kick it.

09:32.700 --> 09:35.829
- What's up with the Band-Aid?
- What?

09:36.810 --> 09:39.609
- Oh my God!
I called you!

09:39.640 --> 09:41.699
- I know. I thought
you'd be home earlier.

09:41.740 --> 09:44.209
- I'm sorry. There was
this old man, I...

09:44.250 --> 09:46.639
What happened?

09:51.620 --> 09:53.179
No.

09:53.220 --> 09:56.827
- Liam.
- No. What?

09:56.860 --> 09:59.921
How? How?

09:59.960 --> 10:02.895
- He was torturing Aidan.
I had to get him out of there.

10:02.930 --> 10:05.228
- I knew I never should've
let you go alone!

10:05.270 --> 10:07.739
This was Aidan's
fight to have!

10:07.770 --> 10:10.000
How did he even let
Liam get close enough?

10:10.040 --> 10:11.769
- There's something else.

10:41.340 --> 10:43.138
- Aidan...

10:46.880 --> 10:49.702
- I--I didn't think that
you were on today.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.104
- I'm not.

10:52.650 --> 10:55.278
Josh told me
what you did for me.

10:55.320 --> 10:58.142
Taking the blame for Brynn.

10:58.190 --> 11:00.488
You didn't have to do that.

11:03.430 --> 11:05.853
- This had to end well
for one of us.

11:05.890 --> 11:08.552
- I know you're
running out of time...

11:10.470 --> 11:13.098
and I know that
things haven't, uh...

11:14.070 --> 11:15.834
been great between us.

11:16.600 --> 11:19.103
But I just want
you to know...

11:19.140 --> 11:20.904
- Oh.

11:22.440 --> 11:24.647
- Go home.
- No, I can't, I just--

11:24.680 --> 11:26.978
- No, it doesn't matter.
I'll cover for you.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.717
You shouldn't be here.

11:29.750 --> 11:33.209
- I'm sorry, I just
thought I had more time.

11:33.260 --> 11:36.890
- Go. Be with Sally and Josh.

11:38.990 --> 11:41.550
(Haroula Rose singing
Close My Eyes to See)

11:41.600 --> 11:46.390
* The rain falls over me

11:46.430 --> 11:50.867
* The river runs to the sea

11:50.910 --> 11:55.609
* Dream of peace
as the way *

11:55.640 --> 11:58.348
* But we wake and fight

11:58.380 --> 12:01.645
* Every day

12:05.350 --> 12:08.615
* The world goes by

12:10.290 --> 12:14.727
* But I
I stay inside *

12:14.760 --> 12:19.368
* Where I'll be anything

12:19.400 --> 12:23.860
* I close my eyes to see...

12:24.910 --> 12:26.469
(Laughing)

12:33.650 --> 12:38.486
* We wanna feel
the sun on our faces *

12:38.520 --> 12:41.114
* But fear

12:42.160 --> 12:43.889
* Its greatness

12:43.930 --> 12:47.093
* Let's row our boats
to shore *

12:48.800 --> 12:53.567
* We'll go where
no one's alone anymore *

12:55.040 --> 12:56.189
(Gasping)

12:57.210 --> 13:00.202
* You call my name

13:01.310 --> 13:04.041
* But I've gone away *

13:04.080 --> 13:05.548
(Coughing)

13:15.520 --> 13:17.056
- Aidan?

13:17.090 --> 13:17.989
(Gasps)

13:18.030 --> 13:20.522
- Are you hurt?
- No! Suzanna...

13:20.560 --> 13:21.493
- Oh!

13:21.530 --> 13:22.827
(Both crying)

13:22.870 --> 13:25.760
They said your entire unit
had been killed!

13:25.800 --> 13:28.235
I prayed that
they were wrong,

13:28.270 --> 13:32.503
that somehow, God would find
a way to bring you back to me.

13:32.540 --> 13:34.872
And he did.
You're here.

13:35.680 --> 13:37.307
You're alive!

13:37.350 --> 13:39.773
- I am here.

13:40.680 --> 13:44.810
But I am not quite alive.

13:46.590 --> 13:48.581
(Sighs)

13:58.670 --> 14:00.638
You got about 10 seconds
to explain to me

14:00.670 --> 14:02.798
what the hell
you're doing here.

14:02.840 --> 14:04.763
- I had to see this
for myself.

14:04.810 --> 14:08.474
I got a very interesting
call from Kenneth just now.

14:08.510 --> 14:11.207
He wants to
renegotiate terms.

14:11.250 --> 14:12.502
- You leave him alone.

14:12.550 --> 14:13.915
(Coughs)

14:15.780 --> 14:17.214
- You've got what?

14:17.250 --> 14:19.981
A day? Maybe two.

14:20.020 --> 14:20.919
(Sniffs)

14:20.960 --> 14:23.258
I can smell
the death on you.

14:23.290 --> 14:24.849
And as for Kenneth, well,

14:24.890 --> 14:28.952
it looks to me like he's about
to become a free agent.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.468
- Ah!

14:30.500 --> 14:33.299
(Coughs, gasps)

14:40.880 --> 14:44.908
- Nick's been
acting strange.

14:44.950 --> 14:46.839
I mean, I know
he's stuck at home

14:46.880 --> 14:50.612
and the only person
he interacts with is me.

14:50.650 --> 14:52.015
I used to think
it was sweet,

14:52.050 --> 14:55.281
being the centre of
his universe, but now...

14:55.320 --> 14:59.427
I don't know.
It's--it's getting intense.

14:59.460 --> 15:00.825
- OK, wait. Come here.

15:00.860 --> 15:03.192
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

15:04.600 --> 15:08.264
- When you and Nick
were together,

15:08.300 --> 15:11.031
did he ever do anything odd?

15:11.070 --> 15:12.606
He bit me.

15:12.640 --> 15:14.074
(Laughs)

15:14.110 --> 15:15.509
- OK, thank God.

15:15.540 --> 15:18.146
I thought you were gonna go all
"oversharus maximus" on me.

15:18.180 --> 15:21.241
Thank you for not doing that.
Love bites are totally normal.

15:21.280 --> 15:23.214
- I thought so. I...

15:23.250 --> 15:26.345
I even kind of
liked it, until...

15:27.390 --> 15:28.653
he broke the skin.

15:28.690 --> 15:31.819
- He bit you that hard?
Are you OK?

15:31.860 --> 15:34.158
- Yeah, I'm fine now.

15:34.960 --> 15:38.260
But Nick is always
staring at me.

15:38.300 --> 15:41.031
He doesn't know I know,
but even when I'm not looking,

15:41.070 --> 15:43.664
I can feel his gaze
on me constantly.

15:43.710 --> 15:47.977
And it's not
the sexy kind of staring.

15:48.880 --> 15:50.678
I'm getting scared.

15:53.220 --> 15:54.346
(Sighs)

15:59.890 --> 16:00.880
- You sure I...

16:00.920 --> 16:03.059
Sure I can't
get you something?

16:03.090 --> 16:05.730
- Couple blood whores
would be nice.

16:05.760 --> 16:07.489
(Door opens)

16:07.530 --> 16:09.191
Just being here is enough.

16:10.470 --> 16:11.790
- (Nora): Hey!

16:11.830 --> 16:13.298
I was on my way home
and I bumped into...

16:13.340 --> 16:15.832
- Kat!
- Hi.

16:20.410 --> 16:22.208
- I'm sorry to just
come in like this,

16:22.240 --> 16:24.470
but I was really
worried about you.

16:24.510 --> 16:26.239
- I didn't want that.

16:26.280 --> 16:27.441
(Sighs)

16:27.480 --> 16:31.747
- Well, sketchily
stealing off mid-conversation?

16:31.790 --> 16:34.213
- (Sighing):
I know. I'm sorry.

16:34.260 --> 16:36.217
It's my bad.

16:38.790 --> 16:41.896
- M-may I ask
what inspired you

16:41.930 --> 16:45.127
to invite one of our only
"muggle"” friends over

16:45.170 --> 16:47.662
during this particularly
supernatural time?

16:47.700 --> 16:50.032
<i>- She was worried.
- I know.</i>

16:50.070 --> 16:54.075
- And with everything going on
with Aidan right now,

16:54.110 --> 16:58.741
it just seemed like a peace
offering, bringing her here.

16:58.780 --> 17:02.216
- It was a really
nice gesture.

17:03.150 --> 17:07.359
It's just the timing is, uh...
- I know.

17:08.690 --> 17:10.419
But I wanted to
do something.

17:12.359 --> 17:15.454
- What's your deal?
What, gambling?

17:15.500 --> 17:17.298
Drugs?

17:17.329 --> 17:21.460
I've seen it all, so you might
as well be honest with me.

17:21.500 --> 17:25.630
I don't have the greatest
track record, admittedly,

17:25.670 --> 17:27.536
but I think
you're better than that.

17:27.579 --> 17:29.400
At least, you could be...

17:29.440 --> 17:30.942
(Coughing)

17:30.980 --> 17:33.312
- Excuse me for just a second.

17:35.520 --> 17:36.919
- Aidan?

17:38.890 --> 17:40.881
Aidan!

17:42.420 --> 17:44.286
- Aidan, hey!

17:44.330 --> 17:45.957
Aidan!

17:50.600 --> 17:53.763
* Almighty love

17:53.800 --> 17:57.065
* Inspires my heart *

17:57.110 --> 18:00.899
- During the war, I dreamed
of hearing you sing again.

18:00.940 --> 18:04.103
The prettiest voice in...

18:04.880 --> 18:07.815
In Corwich...

18:10.120 --> 18:11.815
- Shhh...

18:11.850 --> 18:16.083
- Suzanna, soon I will be gone.

18:17.130 --> 18:20.350
It will be better.
- Shhh!

18:20.400 --> 18:23.768
You will recover
from this. You must.

18:23.800 --> 18:27.259
- It is not worth the price.

18:36.310 --> 18:38.642
- You need blood?
- NO! No.

18:38.680 --> 18:42.275
- I have already had to
say goodbye to you twice.

18:42.320 --> 18:45.950
I will not let you
leave me again.

18:57.530 --> 18:59.396
(Sighs)

19:01.770 --> 19:04.159
- Hey! There you are.

19:04.210 --> 19:04.938
(Laughs)

19:04.970 --> 19:07.064
- I'm so sorry.

19:07.110 --> 19:10.501
- Sorry for getting knocked
on your ass by the flu?

19:10.550 --> 19:12.040
It's not your fault.

19:12.080 --> 19:14.674
You're gonna get some rest,
drink plenty of fluids,

19:14.720 --> 19:16.711
and you'll be up and about

19:16.750 --> 19:19.014
and back to your
sketchy ways in no time.

19:19.050 --> 19:20.859
- I wish...

19:20.890 --> 19:22.187
I wish we had more time.

19:22.220 --> 19:25.429
- OK, you're being
awfully melodramatic.

19:25.460 --> 19:27.952
This will pass.
- (Josh): There he goes again.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.025
Looks like he's out.

19:30.060 --> 19:31.767
- (Nora): Probably be out
all night.

19:31.800 --> 19:33.393
- Yeah, we had this
a few weeks ago,

19:33.440 --> 19:37.308
and we all just passed it
around the house like you do.

19:37.340 --> 19:42.039
- OK. Um, I'll just
let him rest then.

19:42.080 --> 19:44.606
- Thanks for coming by, Kat.

19:52.190 --> 19:54.682
- (Nick): How long does he have?
- A few days.

19:54.720 --> 19:57.519
- Oh my God.
That's awful.

19:57.560 --> 19:58.755
I'm so sorry.

19:58.790 --> 20:02.658
And really, as much
as I appreciate the company,

20:02.700 --> 20:04.464
don't you think that
you should be there,

20:04.500 --> 20:05.865
with the guys?

20:06.400 --> 20:07.731
- Yeah, um...

20:07.770 --> 20:11.729
I actually just wanted to
make sure that you're OK.

20:11.770 --> 20:13.579
- I'm fine.

20:13.610 --> 20:15.078
(Exhales sharply)

20:15.110 --> 20:16.600
- I ate a mouse.

20:17.910 --> 20:19.503
- Oh, thank God.

20:20.350 --> 20:22.239
- Not the reaction
I was expecting.

20:22.280 --> 20:24.339
- You're doing it too,
eating small animals

20:24.390 --> 20:26.210
to stave off
the deterioration.

20:26.250 --> 20:29.083
- And you're OK with that?
- What's there to be OK with?

20:29.120 --> 20:30.519
It's a small price to pay.

20:30.560 --> 20:33.325
Humans eat animals
all the time.

20:33.360 --> 20:36.990
The only difference is that,
for us, they need to be fresh.

20:38.430 --> 20:40.159
(Laughs)

20:41.370 --> 20:44.431
- I guess in the scheme of
things, it isn't that bad.

20:44.470 --> 20:45.437
- No. It's not.

20:45.470 --> 20:48.770
We've been given
a 2nd chance at life.

20:48.810 --> 20:50.676
I'm not letting go.

20:58.850 --> 21:00.557
(Knocking at door)

21:04.260 --> 21:05.625
- Hi there!
- Hi!

21:05.660 --> 21:07.082
(Laughing)

21:07.130 --> 21:09.394
- I thought I'd take you up
on your invitation.

21:09.430 --> 21:14.038
No time like the present, right?
I made some chili!

21:14.070 --> 21:15.492
- Wow! Great.

21:15.540 --> 21:16.792
(Laughs)

21:16.840 --> 21:18.035
This is Pete.

21:18.070 --> 21:20.402
- Oh! Hi there!

21:20.440 --> 21:23.273
- Yeah. Hmm.

21:26.980 --> 21:29.574
- Homemade blackberry wine.

21:29.620 --> 21:30.690
Goes down easy,

21:30.720 --> 21:32.449
packs a mighty punch.

21:32.490 --> 21:34.288
(Chuckling)

21:36.220 --> 21:38.029
- Why do you insist
on befriending

21:38.060 --> 21:39.289
every stray wolf you meet?

21:39.330 --> 21:41.253
- I told him to
stop by "some time."

21:41.300 --> 21:42.756
- Well, that's a nice gesture.

21:42.800 --> 21:45.223
- I was not expecting him
to stop by tonight.

21:45.270 --> 21:46.920
- Not tonight.
That's the...

21:46.970 --> 21:48.563
<i>- I know.</i>

21:48.600 --> 21:52.537
But you don't have to worry, OK?
Because he's not like Liam.

21:52.570 --> 21:53.776
( Humming )

21:53.810 --> 21:55.107
At all.

21:55.140 --> 21:57.074
- It'll take a few minutes
to heat up.

21:57.110 --> 21:58.999
Nothing worse
than chilly chili.

21:59.050 --> 22:00.575
(Laughs)

22:05.750 --> 22:07.184
(Sighs)

22:07.220 --> 22:08.483
Is this a bad time?

22:08.520 --> 22:11.421
- I'm sorry
about that, Pete.

22:11.460 --> 22:13.189
Josh doesn't
mean anything by it.

22:13.230 --> 22:15.050
It's just...

22:15.100 --> 22:17.694
We've got a lot, uh,

22:17.730 --> 22:20.529
piled up on us right now.

22:20.570 --> 22:22.231
- I'm all ears.

22:24.040 --> 22:26.031
(Horn honking)

22:31.980 --> 22:34.278
- They're just mice...

22:39.650 --> 22:41.311
(Sighs)

23:01.040 --> 23:03.873
(Gasps)

23:21.300 --> 23:23.052
- Yeah, he's, uh...

23:23.100 --> 23:24.363
He's resting.

23:24.400 --> 23:25.993
That tea
you made him worked.

23:26.030 --> 23:27.361
- Garlic, man.

23:27.400 --> 23:30.734
Lets them be what they are.
No holding back.

23:30.770 --> 23:31.862
- Thank you.

23:33.170 --> 23:35.639
- I'm really sorry
about your friend.

23:35.680 --> 23:38.900
This past year, man,
it's been rough.

23:38.950 --> 23:41.544
Watching loved ones
wither away like that.

23:42.920 --> 23:44.445
- You had vampire friends?

23:44.490 --> 23:45.787
- Mm-hmm.

23:46.750 --> 23:48.252
Not all of us are haters.

23:48.290 --> 23:50.156
(Chuckles)

23:53.330 --> 23:54.729
- Thank you.

23:54.760 --> 23:56.159
(Laughing)

23:56.200 --> 23:59.522
- So I'm way up
in the Caucasus Mountains.

23:59.570 --> 24:04.064
Nothing around me
but a field of daisies.

24:04.110 --> 24:07.501
I've got a joint
the size of my fist.

24:07.540 --> 24:09.838
Full moon's up in an hour,
and I'm thinking:

24:09.880 --> 24:11.871
"Aw, man, this is perfect.

24:11.910 --> 24:15.141
"Before I get weird,
I'm gonna get weird."

24:15.180 --> 24:16.511
- (Josh): Yeah, yeah.

24:16.550 --> 24:19.190
- Next morning,
I wake up to find

24:19.220 --> 24:21.279
the whole field's
been decimated.

24:21.320 --> 24:24.153
I mean, it's gone.

24:25.190 --> 24:27.852
I was pooping daisies
for a week.

24:27.900 --> 24:29.698
(All laughing)

24:31.230 --> 24:33.767
- You've really been everywhere.

24:33.800 --> 24:34.961
It's amazing.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.901
- Well, traveling's
always been my thing.

24:37.940 --> 24:40.932
Heck, I got scratched while
backpacking with my folks.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.835
- Mmm...

24:42.880 --> 24:45.099
- I was scared at first.

24:45.150 --> 24:47.517
I was so young...

24:48.680 --> 24:51.388
I tortured myself
for years afterwards.

24:51.420 --> 24:55.050
I let it derail everything
I wanted from life.

24:55.090 --> 24:59.687
I fought the change.
I hated my wolf.

25:01.060 --> 25:02.596
It was a dark time.

25:03.460 --> 25:06.498
- How old were you?
- Fourteen.

25:07.430 --> 25:09.865
- And now you're...
- 39.

25:10.870 --> 25:12.099
(Laughs)

25:13.110 --> 25:15.738
When you've had
the equivalent of a heart attack

25:15.780 --> 25:17.999
once a month
for 25 years,

25:18.050 --> 25:19.745
well, it catches up to you.

25:19.780 --> 25:23.114
It took me a long time
to find peace with my wolf,

25:23.150 --> 25:27.383
But Gordon and me
are cool now.

25:27.420 --> 25:30.355
- Gordon?
You named your wolf,

25:30.390 --> 25:32.222
'He has a name.
His name is Gordon.

25:32.260 --> 25:34.490
- Yeah, we're best friends now.

25:34.530 --> 25:36.453
He's my permanent
traveling buddy.

25:36.500 --> 25:38.662
We respect each
other's needs.

25:38.700 --> 25:39.963
- How's that even possible?

25:40.000 --> 25:43.664
- Uh, I learned
some tricks out there.

25:43.710 --> 25:47.362
Have you guys
ever tried meditation?

25:47.410 --> 25:49.674
That's how I first met him.

25:49.710 --> 25:52.441
- It's like a Buddha-under-the-
tree kind of thing?

25:52.480 --> 25:54.847
- No. Ha ha ha!
- Well, I don't know!

25:54.880 --> 25:55.847
- No.

25:55.880 --> 25:57.541
You should try it.

25:59.320 --> 26:00.549
- I don't know, Pete.

26:00.590 --> 26:02.786
I don't think
now's really the time.

26:02.820 --> 26:05.528
- Well, with what
your friend's going through,

26:05.560 --> 26:08.996
and what you're going through,

26:09.030 --> 26:10.668
It's the best time to try it.

26:14.300 --> 26:16.268
(Gasping, moaning)

26:28.520 --> 26:30.909
- Focus on your breath.

26:34.420 --> 26:37.310
Now breathe in your intention...

26:38.330 --> 26:40.424
and let it fill you up.

26:40.460 --> 26:42.724
Then exhale.

26:42.760 --> 26:44.819
(Exhales loudly)

26:44.870 --> 26:46.929
In...

26:48.740 --> 26:50.390
Out.

26:54.880 --> 26:56.302
In...

26:58.980 --> 27:01.574
Out...

27:01.620 --> 27:04.612
Just allow yourself
to let go.

27:08.360 --> 27:10.055
(Branches cracking)

27:29.380 --> 27:31.348
(Inhales sharply)

27:38.590 --> 27:41.355
- Well, that was
a fun exercise in breathing.

27:41.390 --> 27:44.485
My--my lungs
feel terrific.

27:44.530 --> 27:47.955
- I thought it was pretty cool.
- Yeah.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.490
- So what did you see?

27:51.270 --> 27:52.499
- Nothing.
The woods.

27:52.530 --> 27:55.090
- But you could sense
he was there.

27:55.140 --> 27:56.869
He's afraid of you, man.

27:56.900 --> 27:59.437
- He's--he's what?

27:59.470 --> 28:01.006
- Think about it.

28:01.040 --> 28:04.305
You spend all your time
and energy trying to kill him.

28:04.350 --> 28:08.218
Of course he's gonna
cower at first.

28:08.250 --> 28:09.376
Try again.

28:09.420 --> 28:12.185
I mean, you're stuck together.

28:12.220 --> 28:15.053
Might as well get along, huh?

28:15.820 --> 28:17.982
Thanks for the great night.

28:18.030 --> 28:21.295
- Thank you.
- Thanks for stopping by, Pete.

28:21.330 --> 28:23.628
(Gasping)

28:27.800 --> 28:30.929
- I miss the feel of
the sun on my face.

28:30.970 --> 28:34.179
Tall grass whipping
at our legs.

28:35.780 --> 28:36.633
(Sighs)

28:36.680 --> 28:37.841
Isaac's hand in mine.

28:37.880 --> 28:40.099
- He cannot know
you have returned.

28:41.720 --> 28:42.915
Not yet.

28:43.990 --> 28:46.618
It will take time
for him to understand

28:46.650 --> 28:48.687
what you have become.

28:49.790 --> 28:52.953
You truly are
a magnificent creature.

28:54.130 --> 28:56.519
Beautiful.

28:59.070 --> 29:00.629
- I am a monster.

29:00.670 --> 29:04.834
My youth is paid with blood.

29:05.640 --> 29:07.631
- A hawk survives on prey.

29:07.670 --> 29:10.469
That does not
make it monstrous.

29:10.510 --> 29:14.117
Like you, it is a part
of a natural order.

29:14.150 --> 29:16.175
A part of God's plan.

29:16.220 --> 29:20.088
Like you, it deserves
a chance to live.

29:23.390 --> 29:25.028
(Gasping)

29:26.890 --> 29:28.858
- Hey...

29:30.360 --> 29:32.124
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:33.370 --> 29:35.236
(Choking)

29:35.270 --> 29:36.760
- Aidan?
- No!

29:37.640 --> 29:38.937
- Aidan! Sally...

29:38.970 --> 29:40.335
- Is this it?

29:40.370 --> 29:42.805
- Sally, get his arm.

29:42.840 --> 29:45.150
Aidan, breathe,
breathe, breathe!

29:45.180 --> 29:46.341
(Moaning)

29:46.380 --> 29:47.609
- Aidan!
- Aidan!

29:47.650 --> 29:50.472
- Breathe, breathe,
breathe! Aidan!

29:50.520 --> 29:52.409
- Aaah! Aidan!

29:52.450 --> 29:54.885
(Sputtering, coughing)

29:56.090 --> 29:57.489
(Gasps)

30:03.060 --> 30:04.960
- Aidan?

30:06.270 --> 30:08.034
- Aidan?

30:12.310 --> 30:14.233
(Siren wailing in distance)

30:15.240 --> 30:18.141
- What's happening?
- Just wait. Just wait.

30:18.180 --> 30:19.500
You gotta see this.

30:19.550 --> 30:21.609
- Thank you.
Thank you.

30:21.650 --> 30:23.175
- Oh my God!

30:23.220 --> 30:24.312
- I know!

30:24.350 --> 30:26.341
- (Nora): Aidan!

30:26.390 --> 30:27.812
How do you feel?

30:27.860 --> 30:29.453
- Alive. Remarkably.

30:29.490 --> 30:31.458
- A vast improvement,
if you ask me.

30:31.490 --> 30:33.549
- Best day ever.
- This is amazing!

30:33.590 --> 30:34.989
I don't understand! How?

30:35.030 --> 30:37.124
- I don't know.
I--I remember Sally coming in.

30:37.160 --> 30:40.790
And then I felt like
I was burning and...

30:40.830 --> 30:43.561
I haven't felt anything
like it since I was alive.

30:43.600 --> 30:45.238
- That was you
beating the infection.

30:45.270 --> 30:47.500
- I didn't think
dead things could do that.

30:47.540 --> 30:50.840
- Neither did I,
but for some reason...

30:52.750 --> 30:54.479
- (Sally): Well...
- I don't know...

30:54.520 --> 30:56.978
Pete gave you
that garlic tea?

30:57.020 --> 30:59.318
- No. Lots of us eat garlic.
- Well, Kenny blood.

30:59.350 --> 31:02.058
- No, the Dutch were big
on untainted blood.

31:02.090 --> 31:04.252
It didn't help them
once they were sick.

31:05.490 --> 31:07.185
- Honestly,
I don't care.

31:07.230 --> 31:08.356
It's a frigging miracle.

31:08.400 --> 31:10.494
You know, when you went
into that seizure,

31:10.530 --> 31:12.020
I thought that was it.

31:12.070 --> 31:14.767
- Hold up, hold up, seizure?
I went into a seizure?

31:14.800 --> 31:16.461
- Yeah.
- Hugely.

31:16.500 --> 31:19.003
- That's not what
happens at the end.

31:20.810 --> 31:22.505
- Last time you got
all Joker Face

31:22.540 --> 31:24.577
was when you
drank from Josh.

31:24.610 --> 31:27.500
But that was,
like, 2 years ago?

31:27.550 --> 31:30.747
- (Josh): No.
No, it was last week,

31:30.780 --> 31:33.340
when Erin dosed
your blood supply with her--

31:33.390 --> 31:34.755
- Werewolf blood.

31:34.790 --> 31:39.159
Our instincts scream at us
not to drink it.

31:39.190 --> 31:41.830
But I've done it. Twice.

31:41.860 --> 31:44.500
- So you drank from Josh
and got immunized?

31:44.530 --> 31:46.794
- Then you got
a booster from Erin.

31:46.830 --> 31:49.629
- (Nora): This is huge.

31:50.400 --> 31:52.232
If this gets out...

31:53.070 --> 31:56.370
- Yeah. Me beating
this disease...

31:56.410 --> 31:57.707
It's put you all in danger.

31:57.740 --> 32:00.949
I wasn't supposed
to survive this.

32:00.980 --> 32:02.675
- Yes, you were!
Don't say that.

32:02.720 --> 32:04.688
- Liam expected me to die.

32:04.720 --> 32:06.449
And now that I haven't...

32:06.490 --> 32:08.151
- I won't let him near you.

32:09.420 --> 32:11.650
- Neither will I.

32:15.500 --> 32:19.061
(Siren wailing, horn honking)

32:26.210 --> 32:27.905
(Knocking on window)

32:30.010 --> 32:31.774
- Aidan?

32:32.580 --> 32:34.719
Holy crap!
You're back!

32:34.750 --> 32:37.572
And you're better...
Right?

32:37.620 --> 32:39.418
This is amazing!

32:39.450 --> 32:41.088
You have no idea...

32:42.620 --> 32:44.088
So are we good?

32:45.330 --> 32:48.630
- We're good, yeah.
The deal is back on.

32:48.660 --> 32:50.219
But first, um...

32:51.030 --> 32:53.089
I need you to make
a call for me.

32:54.600 --> 32:56.830
(Birds chirping)

33:11.790 --> 33:13.110
- How the...

33:13.150 --> 33:16.450
You know I won't give up
until I figure it out.

33:16.490 --> 33:17.787
- Oh, I know.

33:17.820 --> 33:19.254
You're as relentless
as the virus.

33:19.290 --> 33:21.691
That's why we're
doing this on my terms.

33:25.630 --> 33:26.768
(Sighs)

33:26.800 --> 33:28.996
There's a vaccine, of sorts.

33:29.040 --> 33:31.509
And I will tell you
what helped me,

33:31.540 --> 33:34.737
but only if -- and I cannot
stress to you enough

33:34.780 --> 33:36.600
how much I will
make you suffer

33:36.640 --> 33:39.701
if you don't heed
this warning...

33:39.750 --> 33:42.811
Only if you adhere
to my conditions.

33:42.850 --> 33:44.318
- Yes. Anything.

33:44.350 --> 33:47.149
- You don't even know
what they are.

33:47.190 --> 33:48.009
- Does it matter?

33:48.060 --> 33:51.086
We're dying
out here, Aidan.

33:51.130 --> 33:55.499
That may not matter to someone
who's rejected this community...

33:55.530 --> 33:56.895
but I know who I am.

33:56.930 --> 34:00.025
And I will do anything
to preserve it.

34:04.170 --> 34:05.433
- First...

34:06.410 --> 34:08.071
Never go near Kenny again.

34:08.110 --> 34:10.431
Even if he reaches out. Never.

34:14.350 --> 34:18.947
It's no secret that
2 of my friends are werewolves.

34:18.989 --> 34:22.187
Josh Levinson
and Nora Sergeant.

34:24.360 --> 34:27.181
- The vaccine
is werewolf blood.

34:27.230 --> 34:28.994
(Exhales sharply)

34:29.030 --> 34:30.793
But Josh and Nora
are off limits.

34:30.830 --> 34:33.161
There are a lot of wolves
in town these days.

34:33.199 --> 34:35.464
It only takes a sip.
No one has to die.

34:35.500 --> 34:37.696
- But if I hear

34:37.739 --> 34:39.538
or even suspect

34:39.570 --> 34:43.803
that there are vampires
sniffing around my friends...

34:45.280 --> 34:47.806
I will tear
your head off.

34:51.290 --> 34:53.018
Say it.

34:54.860 --> 34:57.784
- Josh and Nora are off limits.

35:07.830 --> 35:09.969
Why are you even
telling me this?

35:10.800 --> 35:12.700
I thought you hated me.

35:12.740 --> 35:14.834
Hated us.

35:16.240 --> 35:18.277
- We're part of a natural order.

35:20.680 --> 35:22.546
Maybe we deserve
a chance to live.

35:33.690 --> 35:36.489
We shouldn't have to
run scared from wolves anymore.

35:44.040 --> 35:47.032
- I can't believe
how quickly you bounced back.

35:48.280 --> 35:50.601
When I was alive
and I had the flu,

35:50.640 --> 35:52.244
I'd be out for a week.

35:52.280 --> 35:54.840
And then I was, like, a snot
monster for a week after that.

35:54.880 --> 35:58.009
- What about you?
How are you doing?

35:59.520 --> 36:02.581
- I had a slight...

36:03.720 --> 36:05.119
situation.

36:05.990 --> 36:07.185
I ate a mouse.

36:07.230 --> 36:10.291
- Really?
- It was just one time, I swear!

36:10.330 --> 36:12.025
- Not judging.
- Good.

36:12.070 --> 36:13.390
And the weird thing...

36:14.200 --> 36:16.430
The weirder thing...

36:17.400 --> 36:19.368
is that...

36:19.410 --> 36:20.809
(Sighs)

36:20.840 --> 36:22.330
It helped me.

36:22.380 --> 36:25.372
I was starting to fall apart.
- Define "fall apart.”

36:25.410 --> 36:27.071
- Like, pieces of me
were falling.

36:27.110 --> 36:28.919
Peeling, really...
- Rotting?

36:28.950 --> 36:30.509
- No! I hate that word.

36:30.550 --> 36:32.314
(Groans)

36:34.920 --> 36:36.684
- I'm sorry.

36:36.720 --> 36:38.358
Um...

36:40.190 --> 36:42.329
Sally, are you going
to do this?

36:42.360 --> 36:45.819
Are you going to
eat live flesh to survive?

36:45.870 --> 36:47.929
- I can't do that.

36:47.970 --> 36:50.189
I can't.

36:50.240 --> 36:51.765
I got a 2nd chance.

36:52.940 --> 36:57.377
I got one more opportunity
than I was supposed to have,

36:57.410 --> 36:59.742
than anyone is
supposed to have.

36:59.780 --> 37:03.876
I lived while I could,
but the price for hanging on

37:03.920 --> 37:05.911
is just too high.

37:07.390 --> 37:12.180
How long till I need something
more substantial than a mouse?

37:12.230 --> 37:14.756
I can see the slippery
slope from here

37:14.800 --> 37:16.928
and I'm not going
down it again.

37:16.960 --> 37:18.860
I'm not.

37:18.900 --> 37:20.425
So I'm just cutting
myself off now

37:20.470 --> 37:21.995
before it gets
out of control.

37:22.040 --> 37:25.431
- Cold turkey?
- Mm-hmm.

37:26.240 --> 37:29.232
- It's gonna be hard.
- I know.

37:29.280 --> 37:31.647
I'm just gonna live
while I can...

37:33.010 --> 37:35.547
and let go when
it's time to let go.

37:39.490 --> 37:43.188
- I want to be
with you forever.,

37:45.360 --> 37:48.660
- I cannot do that
to our son.

37:54.740 --> 37:56.697
(Sighs)

38:02.280 --> 38:05.500
- When I have been
in the ground

38:05.550 --> 38:08.110
for years and years,

38:08.150 --> 38:11.643
you will still
be young, handsome.

38:14.120 --> 38:16.509
- And alone.
- No.

38:16.560 --> 38:18.585
Promise me this...

38:20.560 --> 38:24.690
When love finds you again
-- and it will --

38:24.730 --> 38:27.267
you will not run from it.

38:28.030 --> 38:30.294
Why else should
one live forever,

38:30.340 --> 38:35.210
but to love,
and love again?

38:42.550 --> 38:44.040
- (Aidan): Kat...

38:44.080 --> 38:45.639
- Aidan!

38:45.690 --> 38:47.317
You look...

38:47.350 --> 38:49.580
Wow, I-- I was coming
to visit you.

38:49.620 --> 38:51.782
I wanted to see
if you were doing OK...

38:51.830 --> 38:55.027
(The Details performing
A National Anthem)

38:55.060 --> 38:56.755
* Your hallway mirror

38:58.160 --> 39:00.060
(Sighs)

39:04.540 --> 39:08.329
* Your hallway mirror...

39:12.250 --> 39:15.345
- Damn leeches don't know
when to give up.

39:15.380 --> 39:17.974
- I'd say that's
our finest quality.

39:18.020 --> 39:19.943
* What a beautiful stranger

39:19.990 --> 39:23.358
* I've become

39:24.860 --> 39:27.852
* Oh...

39:27.890 --> 39:29.494
(Clark grunts)

39:31.160 --> 39:34.095
(Clark grunting,
vampires hissing)

39:36.040 --> 39:38.236
* Oh

39:39.140 --> 39:42.974
* What a beautiful stranger

39:43.010 --> 39:45.650
* I've become

39:47.250 --> 39:50.618
* Oh

39:50.650 --> 39:54.348
* What a beautiful stranger

39:54.390 --> 39:56.779
* I've become *

39:59.890 --> 40:01.255
(Birds chirping)

40:07.370 --> 40:09.691
- I know you're here!

40:15.780 --> 40:17.407
You're beautiful.

40:45.870 --> 40:47.508
- Nick?

40:49.580 --> 40:51.139
Oh my God.

40:52.450 --> 40:55.078
- It's OK, babe.
I know how to make it better.

40:55.120 --> 40:57.418
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing!

40:57.450 --> 41:01.216
I--I just have to eat,
that's all.

41:02.560 --> 41:06.758
But I'm still hungry...
- Aaah!
