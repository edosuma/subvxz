WEBVTT

00:03.699 --> 00:05.005
[laughter]This is such a fun way

00:05.048 --> 00:07.181
to celebrate you guys
finishing the mini-mall.

00:07.224 --> 00:09.748
Hey, did Lisa say
what our next project is?Mm-mm.

00:09.792 --> 00:10.967
I hope it's a water park.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.142
I love a lazy river.

00:12.186 --> 00:13.665
You don't have to
get out to pee.

00:14.753 --> 00:16.712
ALL:
Yes, you do.

00:16.755 --> 00:19.193
Lisa's gonna tell us
about our next project

00:19.236 --> 00:22.022
when she gets here,
and she said it is big.

00:22.065 --> 00:23.284
Hmm.
[chuckles]

00:23.327 --> 00:24.937
I'm feeling so good
I splurged on lobster.

00:24.981 --> 00:26.374
Andi, we're lobster people.

00:26.417 --> 00:28.071
You married good.

00:28.115 --> 00:29.159
[mouths]

00:29.203 --> 00:30.030
[knock at door]

00:30.073 --> 00:32.293
Oh, that's Lisa.

00:34.295 --> 00:35.252
Hey.

00:35.296 --> 00:36.601
Hi.
Oh.

00:36.645 --> 00:38.342
Look at all the people.

00:38.386 --> 00:40.170
That means small talk,

00:40.214 --> 00:43.347
which my therapist
urged me to try, so...

00:43.391 --> 00:46.307
How about sports, huh?

00:47.482 --> 00:49.353
You're so good at that.

00:49.397 --> 00:51.312
Uh, h-hey, come on in.
Come on in. Have a seat.

00:51.355 --> 00:54.184
We were just talking about
the next big project coming up.

00:54.228 --> 00:56.360
Oh, well, I have
great news about that.

00:56.404 --> 00:59.537
The next project
I will be working on is...

00:59.581 --> 01:01.235
myself!

01:01.278 --> 01:03.150
I'm going on sabbatical.

01:03.193 --> 01:06.109
I hope that's the name
of a water slide.

01:06.153 --> 01:08.981
It's a long-term break
to get my life back in order.

01:09.025 --> 01:10.331
Long-term break?

01:10.374 --> 01:12.681
Uh, so what are we
gonna be building?

01:12.724 --> 01:14.074
Well, I don't know
about you two,

01:14.117 --> 01:16.424
but I'll be building a new me.

01:16.467 --> 01:20.080
She might have to take that
thing down to the studs.

01:20.123 --> 01:23.561
Uh, Lisa, you said there'd be
more work after the mini-mall.

01:23.605 --> 01:25.128
We're depending on you.

01:25.172 --> 01:26.782
We let all of our
other clients go.
Yeah.

01:26.825 --> 01:28.131
You can't do this to me.

01:28.175 --> 01:29.698
If I'm home all day,
my wife will make me

01:29.741 --> 01:31.352
take the kids to Mommy and Me.

01:31.395 --> 01:33.702
They don't even have
a men's restroom there.

01:33.745 --> 01:36.531
Okay, fun party.

01:36.574 --> 01:39.142
Wish me luck on my journey.

01:39.186 --> 01:40.491
It's gonna be like that book,

01:40.535 --> 01:42.058
a whole "eat, pray, drink"
thing.

01:43.407 --> 01:45.453
I-I think it's Eat, Pray, Love.

01:45.496 --> 01:47.019
Not when I do it.

01:50.240 --> 01:52.460
We just lost our jobs.

01:52.503 --> 01:54.723
[sighs]

01:56.594 --> 01:58.509
I can't sleep.

02:01.164 --> 02:02.296
I can't sleep!

02:02.339 --> 02:04.472
What?
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:04.515 --> 02:07.170
Did I wake you? I-I can't sleep.

02:07.214 --> 02:10.565
But we did the thing that
usually puts you right to sleep.

02:12.654 --> 02:15.831
Yeah, but I kept
thinking about Lisa.

02:15.874 --> 02:17.354
Afterward. Afterward.

02:18.529 --> 02:20.314
This whole situation with her,

02:20.357 --> 02:21.619
it's my fault.

02:21.663 --> 02:22.925
Well, how do you figure?

02:22.968 --> 02:24.579
She's the crazy one.

02:24.622 --> 02:26.494
Yeah, but I'm the one
who put all our eggs

02:26.537 --> 02:28.278
in her crazy basket.

02:28.322 --> 02:30.585
I convinced Don
to give up our other work.

02:30.628 --> 02:33.065
Oh, Don's fine. Okay?

02:33.109 --> 02:35.459
And don't forget I'm
bringing in money now, too.

02:35.503 --> 02:36.591
Hmm.
I mean,

02:36.634 --> 02:38.549
not as much as if
I were a man,

02:38.593 --> 02:41.161
but I'm just happy
you guys let me vote.

02:43.206 --> 02:46.470
Are we doing women's rights,
or are we gonna do my thing?

02:46.514 --> 02:50.039
Okay. Go ahead.[clears throat]

02:50.082 --> 02:53.434
There's 20 guys on the crew
that are unemployed now,

02:53.477 --> 02:55.262
and they all have families.

02:55.305 --> 02:57.089
One of them has
a secret second family.

02:57.133 --> 02:59.135
That's expensive.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.659
Yeah, but you were
doing bathrooms

03:01.703 --> 03:03.357
and kitchens before Lisa.

03:03.400 --> 03:04.836
You can just go back to that.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.229
But that takes time.

03:06.273 --> 03:07.448
You know? Residential stuff

03:07.491 --> 03:09.145
is all word of mouth,

03:09.189 --> 03:10.494
and for the last year,
we've been saying

03:10.538 --> 03:11.756
we're out of that business.

03:11.800 --> 03:14.150
I... [sighs] I don't know, Andi.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.760
You know what,
just go back to sleep.

If I don't get you out of jail,

03:26.206 --> 03:28.730
I'lldo the time!

03:28.773 --> 03:30.732
That song's catchy.

03:30.775 --> 03:33.474
That guy is such a bozo,

03:33.517 --> 03:35.258
but his business is going great.

03:35.302 --> 03:37.217
I saw him at the car wash
driving a Corvette

03:37.260 --> 03:38.479
with two hot blondes in it.

03:38.522 --> 03:39.480
[chuckles]

03:39.523 --> 03:41.830
And I felt sorry for him

03:41.873 --> 03:43.005
because he thinks

03:43.048 --> 03:45.137
he's happy. [scoffs]Yeah.

03:45.181 --> 03:46.269
You know, maybe
he's doing so well

03:46.313 --> 03:47.270
because he has that commercial.

03:47.314 --> 03:49.141
[scoffs]
[gasps]

03:49.185 --> 03:50.926
You should make one.

03:50.969 --> 03:53.494
Me? Really?

03:53.537 --> 03:54.712
You'd be great.

03:54.756 --> 03:56.497
Yeah, you're very charismatic.

03:56.540 --> 03:58.063
Well, you may
have a point there.

03:59.543 --> 04:02.198
When I see myself
on the security TV at 7-Eleven,

04:02.242 --> 04:05.506
I think, "That guy is stealing
nothing but hearts."

04:06.637 --> 04:08.030
Yeah.

04:08.073 --> 04:09.249
So do a commercial.

04:09.292 --> 04:10.511
It could bring in
a lot of business.

04:10.554 --> 04:12.034
Yeah.

04:13.340 --> 04:15.167
Thanks, honey.You're welcome.

04:15.211 --> 04:17.213
Mmm.Yeah.

04:20.216 --> 04:22.305
You know who wouldn't have
come up with that idea?

04:22.349 --> 04:24.176
Two blondes in a Corvette.

04:24.220 --> 04:25.961
Yeah.

04:26.004 --> 04:27.528
But they have
other things they do.Eh.

04:29.356 --> 04:31.836
♪

04:40.628 --> 04:41.629
Okay, I looked into it.

04:41.672 --> 04:43.108
Our last payment
for the mini-mall

04:43.152 --> 04:44.632
will cover the cost
of the commercial,

04:44.675 --> 04:46.373
including airtime.

04:46.416 --> 04:48.113
I don't know
how good I'll be on camera.

04:48.157 --> 04:50.202

picture with my eyes open.

04:56.252 --> 04:57.732
You've seen me at 7-Eleven.

04:57.775 --> 04:59.647
I light up the screen.

05:00.691 --> 05:02.476
I can shoot it.
I've got a pro-grade camera

05:02.519 --> 05:03.607
and a green screen.

05:03.651 --> 05:04.869
Jen and I like to film ourselves

against exotic backgrounds.

No, it's nothing dirty.

lightsaber battle thrown in.

05:17.055 --> 05:19.101
Okay, I'm gonna stop you
right there. Okay? Yeah?

05:19.144 --> 05:21.103
Uh-huh. Sure.Enough?

05:21.146 --> 05:22.670
Okay. All right, let's think.

05:22.713 --> 05:24.759
All right, we'll have 15 seconds

05:24.802 --> 05:26.587
to sell people
on Burns Brothers Construction.

05:26.630 --> 05:28.240
What's our message?

05:28.284 --> 05:30.591
All right.

05:30.634 --> 05:33.681
We open on a puppy.

05:33.724 --> 05:35.639
Widen to reveal
a girl in a bikini

05:35.683 --> 05:37.249
is holding the puppy.

05:37.293 --> 05:38.816
And then-- whoosh--

05:38.860 --> 05:40.862
"Burns Brothers Construction."

05:43.430 --> 05:44.735
I don't hate it.

05:44.779 --> 05:46.433
I'd call after that.

05:47.651 --> 05:50.088
That has nothing to do
with our business.

05:50.132 --> 05:52.743
W-Why don't we just say...

05:52.787 --> 05:55.616
we do quality work
at a fair price.

05:55.659 --> 05:57.618
I like that. And to showHmm?

05:57.661 --> 05:59.271
how low our prices are,

05:59.315 --> 06:01.012
we'll run away
from cartoon dollar signs

06:03.014 --> 06:05.626
"We hate money."

I feel so bad

06:11.588 --> 06:14.156
for Adam. He was tossing
and turning all night.[chuckles]

06:14.199 --> 06:15.766
Don slept like a baby.

06:15.810 --> 06:17.681
When he gets stressed,
his body shuts down

06:17.725 --> 06:19.248
like those goats that tip over.

06:20.292 --> 06:22.120
You know, I'm thinking

06:22.164 --> 06:23.905
about asking my boss
for a raise.

06:23.948 --> 06:25.689
I mean, I'm the breadwinner now,

06:25.733 --> 06:27.778
so it'd be great if I could,

06:27.822 --> 06:29.911
you know,
win a little more bread.

06:29.954 --> 06:32.827
Do it. Demand a raise.

06:32.870 --> 06:36.265
Yeah, but I'm really bad
at awkward conversations.

06:36.308 --> 06:37.658
I mean, I lose my nerve,

06:37.701 --> 06:40.138
and then I just start to laugh
like an idiot.

06:40.182 --> 06:42.793
Isn't part of your job telling
people their blood test results?

06:42.837 --> 06:45.274
Yeah. Yeah,
I-I've giggled my way

time. Do it now.

gonna know his name.

08:45.002 --> 08:46.438
Uh, Adam,

08:46.482 --> 08:48.092
maybe put your hands
in your pockets this time

08:48.136 --> 08:51.835
and try not to look like
you're falling out of a plane.

08:51.879 --> 08:53.620
Take 16.

08:53.663 --> 08:55.622
Only getting better. [chuckles]

08:55.665 --> 08:57.667
LOWELL:
And action.

08:59.147 --> 09:01.279
Hi. My name is Don Burns,

09:01.323 --> 09:03.978
and I own
Burns Brothers Construction

09:04.021 --> 09:05.806
along with my brother, Adam.

09:05.849 --> 09:07.242
Ha ha.

09:07.285 --> 09:10.245
You said it, Donald.

09:10.288 --> 09:13.074
Can we say "cut"? Because
somebody should say it.

09:14.075 --> 09:14.902
Cut.

09:14.945 --> 09:17.382
Nailed it.

09:20.908 --> 09:22.431
Look at them, Don.

09:22.474 --> 09:24.389
They're starstruck.

09:26.783 --> 09:28.176
Poor Adam.

09:28.219 --> 09:30.178
What happened out there?

09:30.221 --> 09:32.223
Before we started,
he was Tom Cruise.

09:32.267 --> 09:34.922
As soon as I said "action,"
he turned into Rain Man.

09:36.619 --> 09:37.968
I mean, was he that bad?

09:38.012 --> 09:40.362
It felt bad, but I thought
the camera would fix it.

09:40.405 --> 09:43.104
The camera adds weight,
not talent.

09:45.193 --> 09:46.847
Look, we're gonna
have to break it to Adam,

09:46.890 --> 09:48.588
but I can't do it on my own.

09:48.631 --> 09:51.591
You saw how bad I am
at awkward conversations.

09:51.634 --> 09:52.679
I mean,

09:52.722 --> 09:53.854
Don, you'll help, right?

09:53.897 --> 09:55.377
Absolutely. We're family.

09:55.420 --> 09:56.726
We'll all do it together.ANDI:
Okay.

09:56.770 --> 09:58.380
ADAM: Hey, I found some
champagne in the garage!

09:58.423 --> 09:59.773
Okay, here he comes.

09:59.816 --> 10:02.166
All right, stay calm, Andi.

10:02.210 --> 10:04.168
[laughs, snorts] Oh.

10:04.212 --> 10:05.256
Don!

10:06.518 --> 10:07.432
You said you would help.

10:07.476 --> 10:09.783
That's called "acting."

10:09.826 --> 10:11.219
Hey, whoa, w-where's
everybody going?

10:11.262 --> 10:12.829
I got a thing.I'm going to his thing.

10:12.873 --> 10:14.788
I married the thing.I don't want to be here,

10:14.831 --> 10:16.616
and I don't care who knows it.

10:18.661 --> 10:20.968
Oh, well. More champagne for us.

10:21.011 --> 10:23.535
Good. Drinking is
a good idea.
Yeah.

10:23.579 --> 10:25.320
Uh, because, um, yeah,

10:25.363 --> 10:27.061
I-I kind of need
to tell you something.

10:27.104 --> 10:29.672
Yeah, well, go ahead.
I love compliments.

10:29.716 --> 10:31.239
[both laugh]

10:31.282 --> 10:35.069
Um, okay, uh...

10:35.112 --> 10:37.680
Well, about the commercial...

10:37.724 --> 10:40.640
I just... I just think that...

10:40.683 --> 10:43.251
[laughing]

10:43.294 --> 10:46.689
[snorting and laughing]

10:46.733 --> 10:48.473
Oh.

10:48.517 --> 10:51.738
Uh-oh. You're doing your thing.

10:51.781 --> 10:55.089
Okay, you don't have to say it,
'cause I felt it, too.

10:55.132 --> 10:56.307
Oh.

10:56.351 --> 10:58.527
Don kind of stinks.

10:58.570 --> 11:01.138
Oh, boy.

11:01.182 --> 11:02.792
But I think Lowell can fix that.

11:02.836 --> 11:04.751
He'll just focus more on me.

11:04.794 --> 11:07.188
Okay. How do I explain this
to you?

11:07.231 --> 11:09.190
Um... Oh.

11:09.233 --> 11:11.540
Hey, remember how
at all of our friends' weddings,

11:11.583 --> 11:14.021
I used to get up and sing
"Wind Beneath My Wings"

11:14.064 --> 11:15.892
'cause I thought
I was a good singer?

11:15.936 --> 11:18.068
And then, finally,
you had to wrestle me

11:18.112 --> 11:20.157
into the ladies room
at the Hilton and explain to me

11:20.201 --> 11:23.813
that I was ruining
people's most precious day?

11:23.857 --> 11:25.902
[chuckling]:
Yeah. Yeah.

11:27.251 --> 11:29.689
Still nothing?

11:31.081 --> 11:33.823
Okay. Well, honey...

11:33.867 --> 11:35.172
[laughs]
Uh,

11:35.216 --> 11:37.914
we are in the Hilton
ladies room,

11:37.958 --> 11:41.309
and you're about to be crying
by the tampon machine.

11:42.527 --> 11:44.268
This is nothing like that.

11:44.312 --> 11:47.750
Everyone knew you were
a bad singer but you.

11:47.794 --> 11:49.099
[laughing]

11:49.143 --> 11:51.711
Whereas in my case, uh... Oh.

11:53.321 --> 11:56.237
I'm sorry.

11:56.280 --> 11:57.891
Huh.

11:57.934 --> 11:59.762
[laughs]

11:59.806 --> 12:03.113
I kind of pictured this going
in a different direction.

12:03.157 --> 12:05.072
I thought
we'd do a bunch of commercials,

12:05.115 --> 12:08.945
and then Terry Bradshaw would
see it and be my friend.

12:10.338 --> 12:12.775
Well, I'm still your friend.

12:12.819 --> 12:14.385
You know, it's fine.

12:14.429 --> 12:16.039
It's fine.
Oh.

12:16.083 --> 12:18.128
I-I'm sorry, honey.
I-I know it's tough.

12:18.172 --> 12:19.782
Oh, no, no. Hey, hey,

12:19.826 --> 12:21.131
it needed to be said.

12:21.175 --> 12:22.785
Right?

12:22.829 --> 12:24.787
I'm no actor. Big deal.

12:24.831 --> 12:29.009
The important thing is that
the commercial is good.

12:29.052 --> 12:32.186
Yeah.So I will give Lowell a call

12:32.229 --> 12:36.756
and tell him he needs
to find a better... me.

12:36.799 --> 12:38.583
I think he knows.

12:44.851 --> 12:47.375
I like our new Adam. You
could really be brothers.

12:47.418 --> 12:48.811
Yeah.
It's nice
that you're tall.

12:48.855 --> 12:50.247
We could high-five, and
I don't have to crouch down.

12:50.291 --> 12:52.554
Whoa-oh![laughter]

12:53.685 --> 12:55.818
Uh-oh. Adam, you're here.

12:55.862 --> 12:57.602
Didn't you get the
e-mail I sent you--

12:57.646 --> 13:00.083
subject line: "Maybe
stay in the house"?

13:00.127 --> 13:02.433
It's fine. This commercial is
important to Burns Brothers,

13:02.477 --> 13:05.262
so I think I should meet the guy
who's playing me.

13:05.306 --> 13:06.873
That's not gonna be
uncomfortable for you?

13:06.916 --> 13:08.700
What? No.

13:08.744 --> 13:11.051
I rise above.
That's what I do.

13:11.094 --> 13:14.532
That's the spirit.
Hey, New Adam?

13:14.576 --> 13:16.578
Yeah.
I'd like you
to meet someone.

13:16.621 --> 13:19.407
Oh, great. Is this who I
give my lunch order to?

13:19.450 --> 13:23.280
No. No, this is Adam Burns,
the person you're playing.

13:23.324 --> 13:26.849
It's okay, Lowell.
Like I said, I rise above.

13:26.893 --> 13:28.938
Also, there's no budget
for lunch.

13:28.982 --> 13:30.635
I have a cherry ChapStick.

13:30.679 --> 13:32.463
You can nibble on that later.

13:34.161 --> 13:37.555
Uh, so, uh, New Adam,
uh, what's your name?

13:37.599 --> 13:39.557
I'm Leif Forrest.
I'm sorry?

13:39.601 --> 13:42.125
Leif... Forrest.

13:44.736 --> 13:47.391
[laughing]

13:47.435 --> 13:48.958
[laughter]

13:49.002 --> 13:51.526
I'm gonna... I'm gonna
go back over there,

13:51.569 --> 13:54.137
'cause it's easier
to rise above back over there.

13:54.181 --> 13:55.530
[laughs]

13:55.573 --> 13:57.314
ANDI:
Bob,

13:57.358 --> 13:59.577
yesterday, I had to have
a very awkward conversation

13:59.621 --> 14:01.144
with my husband, and...
Yes.

14:01.188 --> 14:04.060
...I realized that it's
something I can do if I have to.

14:04.104 --> 14:05.670
So...

14:05.714 --> 14:08.021
can I have a raise?

14:08.064 --> 14:10.458
I'll let you in
on a little secret.

14:10.501 --> 14:12.416
Our hospital's getting bought
by SuperMed,

14:12.460 --> 14:15.028
and they said they have
big plans for our lab.

14:15.071 --> 14:17.726
I have a call with them later
to finalize the details,

14:17.769 --> 14:20.250
and when I do,
you're gonna get that raise.

14:20.294 --> 14:22.644
Really?!
[laughing]:
Yes.

14:22.687 --> 14:24.428
Oh, thank you, Bob.

14:24.472 --> 14:27.127
I am so proud of myself.

14:27.170 --> 14:28.606
I didn't even snort on you.

14:28.650 --> 14:30.130
[both laughing]

14:30.173 --> 14:31.783
Well, we're both happy
about that.

14:31.827 --> 14:33.220
[both laughing]

14:33.263 --> 14:34.569
[snorting]
Damn it!

14:34.612 --> 14:36.440
Yeah.

14:36.484 --> 14:38.442
All right, let's
get started.

14:38.486 --> 14:41.793
Burns Brothers Commercial,
Episode II: A New Hope.

14:41.837 --> 14:45.101
Take one. Action.

14:45.145 --> 14:47.147
Hi. My name is Don Burns,

14:47.190 --> 14:48.931
and I own Burns Brothers
Construction,

14:48.975 --> 14:50.411
along with my brother Adam.

14:50.454 --> 14:52.152
Here at Burns Brothers,

14:52.195 --> 14:54.676
we know you need quality
work at low prices.

14:54.719 --> 14:57.244
Cut!No. No, no.

14:57.287 --> 15:00.247
You don't say "cut." Isay
"cut." Cut. Now it's official.

15:00.290 --> 15:03.467
Leif, you're doing great so far,
but I just wanted to point out,

15:03.511 --> 15:06.470
you're saying
"quality work at low prices."

15:06.514 --> 15:11.780
Yeah.
It's quali-TEE work
at low PRI-ces.

15:11.823 --> 15:14.261
But nobody
talks like that.

15:14.304 --> 15:15.958
I'm just trying to help,
you know?

15:16.002 --> 15:19.527
You've never actually built
a mini-mall, but I have, so...

15:19.570 --> 15:23.009
Well, I went to six weeks of
acting classes ina mini-mall,

15:23.052 --> 15:24.532
so, I know what I'm doing.

15:24.575 --> 15:26.751
LOWELL:
Okay, okay.

15:26.795 --> 15:29.450
Adam-- TV Adam-- let's just
give it another try.

15:32.018 --> 15:33.845
Are you sure
this guy's better than me?

15:33.889 --> 15:36.239
Yes! Sorry. Yes.

15:37.284 --> 15:39.895
And action.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.245
Hi. My name is Don Burns,

15:42.289 --> 15:43.899
and I own
Burns Brothers Construction,

15:43.943 --> 15:45.683
along with my brother Adam.

15:45.727 --> 15:48.338
Here at Burns Brothers...ADAM:
Cut!

15:49.644 --> 15:51.994
Why are you making that face?

15:52.038 --> 15:54.214
I wasn't
making a face.

15:54.257 --> 15:55.780
Oh, sorry, sorry.

15:55.824 --> 15:57.608
I... I thought you were
making a stupid face.

15:57.652 --> 15:59.088
It's just regular,
you guys.

15:59.132 --> 16:00.611
It's just
his regular face.

16:03.266 --> 16:06.052
And... action.

16:06.095 --> 16:07.575
Hi. I'm Don Burns, and...

16:07.618 --> 16:09.098
Cut.

16:09.142 --> 16:10.317
LOWELL:
Adam, what are you doing?

16:10.360 --> 16:12.580
Just one second. I think
I can help this guy.

16:12.623 --> 16:14.234
Cut. Son of a biscuit!

16:14.277 --> 16:15.583
Okay. Uh...

16:15.626 --> 16:18.194
You're playing me.
Right? Okay?

16:18.238 --> 16:20.980
I am not this.

16:21.023 --> 16:23.547
All right? I am this.

16:25.158 --> 16:26.724
Okay, that's it.

16:26.768 --> 16:28.683
I can't work
with this guy.

16:28.726 --> 16:30.902
Uh-oh. Looks
like we have

16:30.946 --> 16:32.861
a diva on our hands.

16:32.904 --> 16:34.384
Let's get you a snack.

16:34.428 --> 16:37.126
Do you eat snacks, or do you
just do push-ups, or...?

16:38.432 --> 16:40.738
What is with you?What?

16:40.782 --> 16:42.349
Look, we need
this commercial to be good,

16:42.392 --> 16:44.742
and Forrest Gump over there
isn't bringing the magic.

16:44.786 --> 16:46.701
And that's it?

16:46.744 --> 16:48.311
Well, yeah.
What else would there be?

16:48.355 --> 16:50.096
Oh, come on, man.
It's obvious.

16:50.139 --> 16:51.706
You feel threatened

16:51.749 --> 16:54.883
because Leif and
I are very tall.

16:55.884 --> 16:58.017
I am normal height.

16:58.060 --> 17:00.367
This is what people look like.

17:00.410 --> 17:02.369
And if I feel threatened,
it's because it's my fault

17:02.412 --> 17:04.110
our company's in trouble.

17:04.153 --> 17:05.937
I feel like
you're losing confidence in me,

17:05.981 --> 17:08.723
and now you have
literally replaced me.

17:08.766 --> 17:11.117
That was my
second guess.

17:11.160 --> 17:15.295
Wow. I think I just
unlocked something there.

17:16.818 --> 17:19.212
My neck feels so loose
all of a sudden.

17:19.255 --> 17:22.911
Hey, what happened with
Lisa isn't your fault.

17:22.954 --> 17:25.000
We both screwed that up.

17:27.481 --> 17:29.309
Well, thanks for saying that.

17:29.352 --> 17:31.702
Hey, and you were
a little right.

17:31.746 --> 17:33.878
Leif is very tall,
and I don't love it.

17:33.922 --> 17:36.490
Look,

17:36.533 --> 17:40.581
if you don't like that guy,
then I don't like that guy.

17:40.624 --> 17:42.887
Hey, Leif, you're out of here.

17:42.931 --> 17:45.107
Wait. What? Why?

17:45.151 --> 17:47.849
Because I'd rather make
the worst commercial ever

17:47.892 --> 17:49.981
with my brother than
a great commercial

17:50.025 --> 17:52.201
with the most talented
man I've ever met.

17:53.637 --> 17:55.465
Don, you're firing this guy

17:55.509 --> 17:57.424
when he didn't do
a single thing wrong.

17:58.425 --> 18:01.341
You're a good brother.

18:01.384 --> 18:05.040
This is the most unprofessional
set I have ever been on.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.955
And I have been on three.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.962
Hey, welcome back.

18:14.005 --> 18:16.399
Okay, gentlemen,

18:16.443 --> 18:18.097
let's make a
terrible commercial.

18:18.140 --> 18:20.534
Come on.

18:22.013 --> 18:24.277
Hi. My name is Don Burns,

18:24.320 --> 18:27.628
and my brother Adam and I own
Burns Brothers Construction.

18:27.671 --> 18:29.847
You want quality work
at a low price.

18:29.891 --> 18:32.285
That's why we'll match
or beat our competition,

18:32.328 --> 18:36.115
because here at Burns Brothers,
not only do we love puppies...

18:38.421 --> 18:40.467
BOTH [yelling]:
We hate money!

18:40.510 --> 18:42.817
[upbeat tune plays]

18:42.860 --> 18:44.035
[whoosh, rumble]

18:44.079 --> 18:45.994
I love it!

18:46.037 --> 18:48.039
Me not talking
was a good idea.

18:48.083 --> 18:50.825
That puppy's got a hell
of a career ahead of him.

18:50.868 --> 18:52.609
Yeah.We did it, brother,
you and me.

18:52.653 --> 18:54.437
Yeah.
Ah!

18:54.481 --> 18:55.873
"Good job, Lowell."
"Good job, Lowell."

18:55.917 --> 18:57.875
"Oh, thank you.
It's nice to hear."

18:57.919 --> 18:59.442
Great job, Lowell.
Thank you.

18:59.486 --> 19:01.966
[door opens, Adam chuckles]

19:02.010 --> 19:04.099
Hey, Andi,
we finished our commercial.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.188
I think our troubles
are finally...

19:06.232 --> 19:07.711
What's the matter?

19:07.755 --> 19:09.148
I just got laid off.

19:09.191 --> 19:11.106
What?!
Yeah. The...

19:11.150 --> 19:12.934
The hospital got bought,

19:12.977 --> 19:14.892
and the new owners eliminated
our whole department.

19:14.936 --> 19:18.766
When Bob had his call with them,
they just fired all of us.

19:18.809 --> 19:22.726
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

19:22.770 --> 19:25.642
Whoa.

19:25.686 --> 19:29.124
Wow. I guess now
neither of us are working.

19:30.604 --> 19:34.260
Well, look
at it this way.

19:34.303 --> 19:36.610
It's a good thing
you guys hate money.

19:45.749 --> 19:48.796
Okay, let's just try to think
about the good stuff, huh?

19:48.839 --> 19:52.016
I mean, we have a lot
to be thankful for.

19:52.060 --> 19:54.497
Yeah, you're right.

19:54.541 --> 19:56.543
We've got some money
set aside,

19:56.586 --> 19:58.284
and I've got no secret
second family,

19:58.327 --> 20:01.374
so we're saving money
right there.

20:01.417 --> 20:04.159
Yeah, I think we're
gonna be all right.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.769
Of course we will.

20:05.813 --> 20:08.685
Hey, I don't want you worrying.

20:10.557 --> 20:13.299
You know what
I just realized?

20:13.342 --> 20:15.388
Hmm?

20:15.431 --> 20:19.000
I'm out of work,
and you're out of work.

20:19.043 --> 20:22.873
So we're finally getting paid
the same for the same job.

20:22.917 --> 20:24.571
[chuckles]There's your equal rights.

20:24.614 --> 20:26.529

20:28.357 --> 20:31.752
WOMAN: ♪ Go ahead
and get drunk as a skunk ♪

20:31.795 --> 20:35.103
♪ We'll get you out of jail!

20:35.146 --> 20:37.323
Damn, it iscatchy.Mm.

20:37.366 --> 20:39.499
We should have
done a jingle.

20:39.542 --> 20:40.543
What?
