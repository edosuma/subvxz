43:39.617 --> 43:43.254
THERE IS STILL NO SIGN
OF BILLIONAIRES RICHARD
AND REGINA RICH,

43:43.254 --> 43:45.857
MISSING SINCE
THE APPARENT CRASH
OF THEIR PLANE...

43:45.857 --> 43:48.493
THEY'RE ALIVE, CADBURY.
I KNOW IT.

43:48.493 --> 43:50.896
AND WHEREVER THEY ARE,
MASTER RICHIE,

43:50.896 --> 43:53.031
I'M SURE THEY'RE TOGETHER...

43:53.031 --> 43:54.232
AND HAPPY.

43:55.266 --> 43:58.269
RICHARD, IF WE EVER
GET OUT OF THIS,

43:58.269 --> 44:02.708
I'M GOING TO SOAK
IN A VAT OF OIL OF OLAY.

44:02.708 --> 44:04.710
WHY HAVEN'T THEY
FOUND US YET?

44:04.710 --> 44:08.513
WELL, PROBABLY BECAUSE
THE LOCATOR TRANSMITTER
IN THE PLANE

44:08.513 --> 44:10.916
IS UNDER A MILE
OF WATER.

44:10.916 --> 44:13.318
UNLESS WE CAN SEE
A RADIO SHACK SOON,

44:13.318 --> 44:17.188
KISS OFF ANY CHANCE
OF GETTING MY DADLINK
TO WORK.

44:17.188 --> 44:19.190
THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON
RUTHLESS ENOUGH

44:19.190 --> 44:21.793
TO SET OFF A BOMB
ON OUR PLANE.

44:21.793 --> 44:23.394
WHEN I CATCH HIM--

44:23.394 --> 44:24.996
WE DON'T
KNOW FOR SURE--

44:24.996 --> 44:27.598
OH, RICHARD, WAKE UP
AND SMELL THE SEAWEED!

44:27.598 --> 44:31.069
YOU SHOULD'VE FIRED HIM
YEARS AGO!

44:31.069 --> 44:34.740
I HAVE NEVER FIRED
ANYONE. I'M NOT
STARTING NOW.

44:34.740 --> 44:36.474
BUT VAN DOUGH...

44:36.474 --> 44:40.712
NO DOUBT HE THOUGHT
RICHIE WAS ON
THE PLANE, TOO.

44:40.712 --> 44:42.513
REGINA, WE HAVE
TO SURVIVE,

44:42.513 --> 44:47.285
IF ONLY TO WARN
RICHIE HIS LIFE
IS IN DANGER.

44:52.457 --> 44:54.059
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

44:56.161 --> 44:59.164
BEFORE WE BEGIN,
I WOULD LIKE US
TO OBSERVE

44:59.164 --> 45:01.967
A MOMENT OF SILENCE
ON THE TRAGIC PASSING

45:01.967 --> 45:03.902
OF MR. AND MRS. RICH.

45:05.570 --> 45:06.571
NOW...

45:06.571 --> 45:09.074
FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS...

45:10.308 --> 45:13.244
UNITED TOOL.

45:14.712 --> 45:17.282
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
THEY CLOSED THE FACTORY?

45:17.282 --> 45:18.683
IT JUST HAPPENED.

45:18.683 --> 45:20.218
MY MOM AND EVERYONE
GOT FIRED.

45:20.218 --> 45:23.221
GLORIA, I DIDN'T KNOW.
YOU'VE GOT TO BELIEVE ME.

45:23.221 --> 45:25.290
I'M SORRY ABOUT
YOUR PARENTS,

45:25.290 --> 45:26.424
BUT CAN'T YOU HELP?

45:36.234 --> 45:39.237
I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN DO THIS, CADBURY.

45:39.237 --> 45:43.408
REMEMBER THIS--
VIRUM VIRTUS PATRIUS
INTRAM HABES.

45:43.408 --> 45:44.709
WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

45:44.709 --> 45:48.013
IT MEANS YOU HAVE
THE POWER OF YOUR FATHER
INSIDE YOU.

45:48.013 --> 45:51.049
KIND OF LIKE,
"TRUST THE FORCE, LUKE."

45:52.583 --> 45:55.220
EXACTLY, SIR.

46:04.595 --> 46:07.198
WHOO! IT'S SO HARD!

46:08.299 --> 46:10.435
SIR.

46:11.736 --> 46:15.373
MR. RICHARD RICH JR.
TO SEE YOU.

46:17.976 --> 46:21.579
UH, MISS FAIRCHILD,
I NEED THOSE MEMOS
BY 3:00 TODAY.

46:21.579 --> 46:24.182
YES, SIR,
MR. VAN DOUGH, SIR.

46:24.182 --> 46:25.350
RICHIE.

46:25.350 --> 46:27.452
RICHIE, RICHIE.

46:27.452 --> 46:28.887
RICHIE,

46:28.887 --> 46:30.755
PLEASE ALLOW ME
TO EXPRESS

46:30.755 --> 46:32.757
MY HEARTFELT SYMPATHIES
ON YOUR LOSS.

46:32.757 --> 46:35.560
WE ALL LOVED YOUR
PARENTS VERY MUCH.

46:35.560 --> 46:37.963
MY PARENTS ARE ALIVE.

46:37.963 --> 46:41.232
I PRAY NIGHTLY
THAT THEY ARE.

46:41.232 --> 46:44.769
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
WE'RE DOING
EVERYTHING WE CAN

46:44.769 --> 46:46.771
TO COORDINATE
THE SEARCH EFFORT.

46:46.771 --> 46:48.373
PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT.

46:57.282 --> 47:00.919
SO, RICHIE, WHAT
HAVE YOU COME
TO SEE ME ABOUT?

47:00.919 --> 47:04.522
WELL, UNTIL MY PARENTS
COME BACK, I'VE TAKEN A...

47:04.522 --> 47:06.224
SABBATICAL, SIR.

47:06.224 --> 47:08.826
I'VE TAKEN A SABBATICAL
FROM SCHOOL...

47:08.826 --> 47:11.696
SO I CAN BE HERE
AND RUN THINGS.

47:11.696 --> 47:14.565
AH. RUN THINGS.

47:14.565 --> 47:18.369
UM, RICHIE,
THE, UH, THE JOB

47:18.369 --> 47:19.938
OF SENIOR OFFICER

47:19.938 --> 47:21.940
OF A MUL...

47:23.208 --> 47:26.777
TINATIONAL
CORPORATION...

47:26.777 --> 47:29.514
IS VERY, UH, DEMANDING.

47:29.514 --> 47:30.515
BUSINESS...

47:30.515 --> 47:32.350
HOURS GO...

47:32.350 --> 47:34.619
WELL, JUST
WAY PAST YOUR BEDTIME.

47:34.619 --> 47:39.024
SO I THINK IT'S BEST
TO LEAVE THIS JOB TO...

47:40.858 --> 47:42.260
TO AN ADULT

47:42.260 --> 47:45.763
WHO HAS EXPERIENCE
IN THESE MATTERS. O.K.?

47:45.763 --> 47:48.033
I DON'T THINK SO.

47:49.034 --> 47:52.037
BY THE WAY, CADBURY,
HOW MUCH STOCK
DO I OWN?

47:52.037 --> 47:54.439
UNTIL YOUR PARENTS
ARE FOUND, SIR,

47:54.439 --> 47:58.609
AS THE SOLE HEIR,
YOU OWN 51% OF
THE VOTING STOCK.

47:58.609 --> 48:00.411
BUT YOU'RE NOT
OF LEGAL AGE

48:00.411 --> 48:02.713
TO EXERCISE
YOUR VOTING RIGHTS.

48:02.713 --> 48:04.115
BUT I AM, SIR.

48:04.115 --> 48:07.118
AND UNDER THE TERMS
OF THE RICH ESTATE,

48:07.118 --> 48:09.520
I STAND
IN LOCO PARENTES

48:09.520 --> 48:12.223
AND GUARDIAN AD LITEM
TO MASTER RICHIE.

48:12.223 --> 48:15.426
AND, ACCORDINGLY,
I GIVE HIM FULL
PROXY POWER

48:15.426 --> 48:17.162
AND AUTHORITY.

48:19.064 --> 48:20.665
AND, BY THE WAY,

48:20.665 --> 48:23.969
UNITED TOOL STAYS OPEN.

48:23.969 --> 48:25.670
FINE.

48:28.906 --> 48:31.476
ROUND ONE TO YOU, SIR.

48:41.752 --> 48:44.555
BUT WITH THE LOSSES
IN OUR MANUFACTURING
DIVISION,

48:44.555 --> 48:46.024
THIS WILL NECESSITATE--

48:46.024 --> 48:48.259
[SLURPING]

48:52.897 --> 48:54.165
SORRY.

48:54.165 --> 48:56.901
WILL NECESSITATE SOME
EMPLOYEE DOWNSIZING.

48:56.901 --> 48:58.703
DOWNSIZING?

48:58.703 --> 49:00.038
YOU MEAN
FIRING PEOPLE.

49:00.038 --> 49:03.041
WELL, CALL IT
WHAT YOU WILL, RICHIE.

49:03.041 --> 49:05.576
IT IS OUR JOB
TO CUT THE FAT.

49:05.576 --> 49:08.313
MR. VAN DOUGH, MY FATHER
NEVER FIRED ANYBODY.

49:08.313 --> 49:11.316
HE SAID WHEN PEOPLE
ARE SECURE IN THEIR JOBS,

49:11.316 --> 49:14.252
THEY WORK HARDER,
HAPPIER, AND BETTER.

49:14.252 --> 49:17.922
SO I THINK IF
WE NEED TO CUT THE FAT,

49:17.922 --> 49:19.724
LET'S START
RIGHT HERE.

49:30.601 --> 49:31.402
MORNING.

49:31.402 --> 49:33.004
GOOD MORNING.
GOOD MORNING.

49:33.004 --> 49:34.005
YOUR MESSAGES.

49:34.005 --> 49:35.006
MORNING, SYLVIA.

49:35.006 --> 49:36.007
MORNING.

49:36.007 --> 49:37.475
MR. RICH, GOOD MORNING.

49:37.475 --> 49:39.677
YEAH, MARVIN.
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

49:39.677 --> 49:41.746
ALL I WANT TO KNOW IS,

49:41.746 --> 49:44.949
IF ALL OUR DIVISIONS
ARE DOING RECORD-BREAKING
BUSINESS,

49:44.949 --> 49:47.352
WHY ARE RICH CANDY BARS
DOWN 12%?

49:47.352 --> 49:51.156
COME ON. HAVE YOU EVER
TASTED A RICH BAR?

49:54.859 --> 49:56.994
[RUFF RUFF RUFF]

49:56.994 --> 50:01.199
HE'LL GET BACK TO YOU
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE,
MR. IACOCCA. GOODBYE.

50:01.199 --> 50:03.034
RICHIE RICH'S OFFICE.

50:05.770 --> 50:07.172
WHOA. TALK ABOUT
GUM BALLS!

50:07.172 --> 50:09.340
RICHIE RICH'S OFFICE.

50:09.340 --> 50:11.342
I'M SORRY. HE'S NOT
AVAILABLE.

50:11.342 --> 50:13.978
HE'S IN CONFERENCE.
I'LL HAVE HIM CALL YOU.

50:13.978 --> 50:15.680
WE'D LIKE TO SEE RICHIE.

50:15.680 --> 50:16.847
AND YOU ARE...

50:16.847 --> 50:18.249
HEY, THEY'RE FREE!

50:18.249 --> 50:19.650
WE'RE HIS FRIENDS.

50:19.650 --> 50:22.987
WE WANT TO THANK HIM
FOR REOPENING THE FACTORY.

50:22.987 --> 50:24.722
MR. RICH IS TOO BUSY--

50:24.722 --> 50:26.257
WAIT. WE CAN--

50:26.257 --> 50:28.326
RICHIE RICH'S OFFICE.

50:28.326 --> 50:29.894
HEY!

50:29.894 --> 50:31.596
EXCUSE ME!

50:31.596 --> 50:33.030
SOMEBODY HELP!

50:33.030 --> 50:35.800
I DIDN'T DO IT!
I DIDN'T DO IT!

50:35.800 --> 50:37.668
GET PEE WEE,
WE'RE GOING IN.

50:39.204 --> 50:40.805
I DIDN'T DO IT!

50:40.805 --> 50:41.806
OH!

50:41.806 --> 50:43.208
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

50:44.575 --> 50:45.943
RICHIE?

50:45.943 --> 50:48.713
GLORIA?
HEY, GUYS.

50:48.713 --> 50:49.814
CLOSE THE DOOR.

50:49.814 --> 50:52.217
I'LL GET BACK
TO YOU, MARVIN.

50:52.217 --> 50:55.220
YEAH. MY NEW RESEARCH
AND DEVELOPMENT TEAM

50:55.220 --> 50:57.021
JUST WALKED IN.

50:57.021 --> 50:58.823
WHAT?WHAT?
WHAT?

50:58.823 --> 51:00.225
AND FINALLY,
AFTER EXTENSIVE

51:00.225 --> 51:01.626
AND EXHAUSTING
TASTE TESTING

51:01.626 --> 51:04.829
BY MY NEW RESEARCH
AND DEVELOPMENT TEAM...

51:04.829 --> 51:06.231
HI.
HI, EVERYBODY.

51:06.231 --> 51:08.366
I'VE COME TO
THE CONCLUSION

51:08.366 --> 51:10.235
THAT WE
AT RICH CANDIES

51:10.235 --> 51:12.637
MUST INCREASE
OUR NUT PROPORTION
BY 15%.

51:12.637 --> 51:14.839
WE SIMPLY CANNOT
LET OUR COMPETITION

51:14.839 --> 51:17.074
BE NUTTIER
THAN WE ARE.

51:17.074 --> 51:18.576
I LIKE IT.
GREAT!

51:18.576 --> 51:19.577
YES!

51:19.577 --> 51:20.578
GOOD JOB.

51:20.578 --> 51:21.579
THUMBS UP.

51:28.085 --> 51:30.087

51:33.758 --> 51:35.160
COME ON, GUYS.

51:35.160 --> 51:36.161
EXCUSE ME.

51:36.161 --> 51:37.162
EXCUSE ME!

51:37.162 --> 51:38.363
COMING THROUGH!

51:42.367 --> 51:45.870
ALL THOSE IN FAVOR
OF MY MOTION.

51:45.870 --> 51:47.138
[SLURPING]

51:50.775 --> 51:52.410
ALL OPPOSED?

52:02.220 --> 52:03.621
I HATE THAT KID.

52:03.621 --> 52:05.223
NO. NO. CLOCKWISE.
CLOCKWISE.

52:05.223 --> 52:06.624
I SAID MASSAGE CLOCKWISE.

52:06.624 --> 52:08.826
THESE MIGRAINES
ARE BAD ENOUGH

52:08.826 --> 52:10.228
WITHOUT YOUR INCOMPETENCE.

52:10.228 --> 52:11.229
GET OUT!

52:11.229 --> 52:14.632
YES, SIR,
MR. VAN DOUGH.

52:14.632 --> 52:15.833
NOW, YOU LISTEN.

52:15.833 --> 52:19.804
I WANT YOU TO PUT
THE REVISED PLAN
WE DISCUSSED

52:19.804 --> 52:20.805
INTO ACTION.

52:20.805 --> 52:23.208
THIS TIME, MAKE SURE
THE GLOVES COME OFF.

52:23.208 --> 52:24.775
GLOVES, SIR?

52:26.177 --> 52:27.712
IT'S A METAPHOR,
HAM-HEAD.

52:31.849 --> 52:33.251
WELL, THAT'S IT, HONEY.

52:33.251 --> 52:35.653
WE'RE OUT OF PERRIER,
THE CAVIAR'S GONE,

52:35.653 --> 52:37.655
AND THERE'S NO MORE
MELBA TOAST.

52:37.655 --> 52:41.058
THE ONLY THING
WE'VE GOT LEFT
IS A BOTTLE OF DOM.

52:41.058 --> 52:44.862
AND THIS LITTLE
PACKET OF BUBBLICIOUS,
RICHIE'S FAVORITE.

52:44.862 --> 52:46.264
OHH.

52:46.264 --> 52:48.799
HE'S ONLY
12 YEARS OLD,
RICHARD.

52:48.799 --> 52:50.601
HE'S JUST A BOY.

52:50.601 --> 52:52.603
NOW, REGINA, I'M SURE
WHATEVER HAPPENS,

52:52.603 --> 52:54.805
HE'S GOING TO BE
JUST FINE.

52:57.808 --> 52:59.677
OH, MY GOD!

52:59.677 --> 53:00.811
WHAT? WHAT IS IT?

53:00.811 --> 53:01.812
WE'RE SAVED!

53:01.812 --> 53:02.713
WHAT, WHAT?

53:02.713 --> 53:06.451
MY LOUIS, DARLING!
MY SUITCASE!

53:09.220 --> 53:11.222
AND WHEN MY FATHER
GETS BACK,

53:11.222 --> 53:13.224
I'M SURE HE'LL BE
REALLY HAPPY

53:13.224 --> 53:16.227
TO SEE WHAT WE'VE DONE
WHILE HE WAS GONE.

53:16.227 --> 53:18.229
THE PROFITS
FROM EVERY DIVISION

53:18.229 --> 53:21.499
HAVE GONE UP
ON A RECORD-BREAKING RISE.

53:21.499 --> 53:23.634
DOESN'T GIVE YOU
THE RIGHT--

53:23.634 --> 53:26.837
I'M SORRY, SIR,
BUT THIS IS OFFICIAL
POLICE BUSINESS.

53:26.837 --> 53:28.105
HERBERT CADBURY!

53:28.105 --> 53:29.340
YES?

53:29.340 --> 53:30.408
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

53:30.408 --> 53:32.009
I BEG YOUR PARDON?

53:32.009 --> 53:33.411
WHAT IS THIS?

53:33.411 --> 53:36.247
OFFICERS, YOU CAN'T
JUST BURST IN HERE.

53:36.247 --> 53:37.648
WE RECEIVED
AN ANONYMOUS TIP

53:37.648 --> 53:39.650
AND SEARCHED
THE RICH MANSION.

53:39.650 --> 53:41.252
BOMB PARTS,
DETONATION DEVICES

53:41.252 --> 53:43.788
FOUND IN HERBERT
CADBURY'S ROOM.

53:43.788 --> 53:44.689
THAT'S PREPOSTEROUS!

53:44.689 --> 53:46.524
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST
FOR THE MURDER

53:46.524 --> 53:48.793
OF RICHARD
AND REGINA RICH.

53:48.793 --> 53:50.861
WAIT! CADBURY!

53:50.861 --> 53:51.862
CADBURY!

53:51.862 --> 53:53.063
CADBURY!

53:53.063 --> 53:55.966
RICHIE, THE POLICE
HAVE HIM NOW.
BEST STAY HERE.

53:55.966 --> 53:59.604
YOU UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU CAN STOP
THIS PROCEEDING...

53:59.604 --> 54:00.505
RICHIE!

54:00.505 --> 54:03.408
RICHIE, IS IT TRUE
THAT MR. CADBURY

54:03.408 --> 54:06.411
PLANTED THE BOMB
ON YOUR PARENTS'
PRIVATE JET?

54:06.411 --> 54:08.679
HOW DOES IT FEEL
TO BE BETRAYED

54:08.679 --> 54:10.915
BY YOUR MOST
TRUSTED SERVANT?

54:12.249 --> 54:13.784
MR. VAN DOUGH!

54:13.784 --> 54:16.153
WE'RE ALL DEEPLY SADDENED
BY THIS TRAGIC TURN
OF EVENTS.

54:16.153 --> 54:19.056
AS MUCH AS I WOULD
LIKE TO BELIEVE

54:19.056 --> 54:20.558
IN HERBERT CADBURY'S
INNOCENCE,

54:20.558 --> 54:23.461
I'M AFRAID THE EVIDENCE
POINTS IN THE OTHER
DIRECTION.

54:23.461 --> 54:25.863
MY MAIN CONCERN
IS THAT POOR RICHIE

54:25.863 --> 54:27.865
SURVIVES THIS...
TERRIBLE EPISODE,

54:27.865 --> 54:30.468
AND HAVING HIS BEST
INTERESTS AT HEART,

54:30.468 --> 54:32.470
I HAVE PETITIONED
SUPERIOR COURT
