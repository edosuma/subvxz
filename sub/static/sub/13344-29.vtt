WEBVTT

00:05.739 --> 00:08.209
Man:
PREVIOUSLY ON
"IN TREATMENT"...

00:08.309 --> 00:11.412
- HE THREATENED
TO KILL ME.
- ( chuckles )

00:11.512 --> 00:14.148
- YOU'RE SMILING.
- I'VE HAD PATIENTS
OVER THE YEARS

00:14.248 --> 00:15.683
WHO HAVE HAD
THEIR LIVES THREATENED.

00:15.783 --> 00:18.519
YOU JUST BROUGHT THIS UP
LIKE IT WAS NOTHING.

00:19.953 --> 00:21.322
DID YOU MEAN
THAT LITERALLY, JAKE?

00:21.422 --> 00:24.658
OF COURSE NOT!
I'M NOT GONNA
FUCKIN' KILL HER.

00:25.993 --> 00:28.496
I WANT A DIVORCE.

00:32.766 --> 00:34.735
I HAVEN'T SLEPT
IN LIKE A WEEK.

00:34.835 --> 00:36.104
I CAN'T SLEEP,
I CAN'T EAT.

00:36.204 --> 00:37.705
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

00:39.573 --> 00:42.443
I REALLY--
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO LEAVE ME.

00:47.748 --> 00:48.982
MM-HMM.

00:49.083 --> 00:52.052
GOT IT. GREAT.

00:53.987 --> 00:55.689
GREAT.

00:55.789 --> 00:58.126
RIGHT. GOT IT, THANKS.

00:59.793 --> 01:01.395
- AH, HELLO.
- HI.

01:01.495 --> 01:03.397
I'M A LITTLE EARLY.
I HOPE THAT'S OKAY.

01:03.497 --> 01:06.567
OH, THAT'S OKAY.
CAN YOU-- CAN YOU JUST
GIVE ME A FEW MINUTES?

01:08.035 --> 01:10.070
- SURE.
- THANKS.

01:21.682 --> 01:23.651
( theme music playing )

01:46.540 --> 01:48.542
I'M JUST GONNA
CLOSE THE CURTAINS.

02:02.890 --> 02:04.592
HOW ARE YOU, AMY?

02:04.692 --> 02:06.394
GOOD.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.100
YOU SEEM A LITTLE...

02:13.201 --> 02:14.702
RESTLESS.

02:14.802 --> 02:18.038
I WANTED TO GET HERE EARLY.
I JUST-- I RUSHED A LITTLE.

02:18.138 --> 02:21.008
WHY WOULD YOU RUSH
TO BE HERE EARLY?

02:21.108 --> 02:24.178
WELL, ONE OF US
IS OFTEN LATE, SO...

02:25.679 --> 02:26.980
I DON'T KNOW.

02:27.080 --> 02:29.217
JAKE'S NOT COMING.

02:29.317 --> 02:31.685
- OH.
- DON'T WORRY,
WE'RE TOGETHER.

02:31.785 --> 02:33.954
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

02:34.054 --> 02:35.989
WE'RE SEEMINGLY IN LOVE,

02:36.089 --> 02:39.360
AND HE KNOWS THAT I'M HERE
AND IT'S FINE FOR HIM TO KNOW
EVERYTHING THAT WE TALK ABOUT.

02:42.696 --> 02:45.933
I HAVE TO TELL YOU,
I WAS OFFENDED...

02:46.033 --> 02:47.301
OUTSIDE, JUST NOW.

02:47.401 --> 02:48.969
I-- I MEAN,
I KNOW I'M AN ADULT

02:49.069 --> 02:51.205
AND-- AND YOU HAVE
THINGS THAT I DON'T
NEED TO SEE OR HEAR,

02:51.305 --> 02:53.841
BUT I FELT LIKE
A SCOLDED CHILD.

02:53.941 --> 02:55.576
IT-- NEVER MIND.
( sighs )

02:55.676 --> 02:57.845
IT'S CRAZY.
IT'S NOT YOU,
IT'S-- IT'S ME.

02:57.945 --> 03:00.113
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO ME,
BUT I FELT LIKE...

03:00.214 --> 03:01.949
A LITTLE EMBARRASSED
BECAUSE I'D ALREADY STOOD UP

03:02.049 --> 03:03.251
AND THEN YOU
SUDDENLY STOPPED ME.

03:03.351 --> 03:05.152
WELL, I CERTAINLY
APOLOGIZE IF I--

03:05.253 --> 03:06.687
I WONDERED IF
THERE ARE PATIENTS

03:06.787 --> 03:09.390
THAT YOU WOULD'VE LET IN
EVEN IF THEY ARRIVED EARLY.

03:09.490 --> 03:12.092
YOU KNOW, PATIENTS THAT
YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT
RELATIONSHIP WITH.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.228
I KNOW JAKE
AND I AREN'T EASY,

03:14.328 --> 03:16.530
AND I JUST THINK
YOU MUST HAVE...

03:16.630 --> 03:19.400
EASIER PATIENTS,
MORE INTERESTING PATIENTS,

03:19.500 --> 03:21.502
PATIENTS THAT ARE MORE FUN,
PATIENTS THAT YOU LIKE MORE.

03:21.602 --> 03:24.838
IS MY ENJOYMENT
OF OUR SESSIONS
IMPORTANT TO YOU?

03:24.938 --> 03:27.341
MAYBE.

03:27.441 --> 03:30.411
AND SO IT WOULD BOTHER YOU
IF I DIDN'T ENJOY THEM?

03:31.712 --> 03:33.581
MAYBE NOT.

03:33.681 --> 03:35.516
FORGET IT.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.152
HMM.

03:39.253 --> 03:41.822
YOU SAID THAT
JAKE AND YOU, UH...

03:41.922 --> 03:43.424
WEREN'T EASY
AS PATIENTS.

03:43.524 --> 03:46.093
HOW WOULD YOU DEFINE
YOURSELF AS A PATIENT?

03:46.193 --> 03:48.128
BAD.

03:48.228 --> 03:51.565
( giggles )
JUST KIDDING.

03:51.665 --> 03:53.233
I MEAN, I WOULDN'T
TRADE PLACES WITH ANYONE.

03:53.334 --> 03:55.936
IT'S JUST--
I DON'T KNOW.

03:58.672 --> 04:01.442
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT
CHANGING PLACES WITH ANYBODY?

04:03.711 --> 04:06.380
- PERHAPS.
- WHO WOULD YOU
LIKE TO TRADE WITH?

04:06.480 --> 04:08.616
WHAT KIND OF A PATIENT
WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE?

04:12.185 --> 04:13.821
MAYBE I WANT YOU
TO BE DIFFERENT.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.155
ME? DIFFERENT HOW?

04:15.255 --> 04:17.891
I DON'T KNOW.
HARRISON FORD.

04:20.628 --> 04:21.862
OKAY.

04:21.962 --> 04:24.365
( chuckles )
THAT'S A BIT
OF A STRETCH FOR ME,

04:24.465 --> 04:26.367
BUT, UM-- OKAY.

04:26.467 --> 04:28.268
( both laugh )

04:28.369 --> 04:32.306
SO HOW WOULD
DR. HARRISON FORD BEHAVE

04:32.406 --> 04:34.274
IF-- IF YOU WERE
EARLY FOR A SESSION?

04:34.375 --> 04:36.777
WHO SAYS I'D BE
SEEING HIM FOR THERAPY?

04:39.813 --> 04:43.851
HE CERTAINLY WOULDN'T
MAKE ME WAIT OUTSIDE
LIKE A NAUGHTY SCHOOLGIRL.

04:43.951 --> 04:46.920
SO YOU FELT THAT WAS
LIKE SOME KIND OF REJECTION?

04:49.590 --> 04:51.325
HM-MMM.

05:01.268 --> 05:03.371
OKAY, SO...

05:04.772 --> 05:07.541
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING

05:07.641 --> 05:10.110
SINCE I SAW YOU LAST WEEK.

05:10.210 --> 05:11.945
EVERYTHING'S FINE,

05:12.045 --> 05:14.348
LIKE I TOLD YOU.

05:17.785 --> 05:21.288
YOU SAID THAT YOU AND JAKE
WERE "SEEMINGLY IN LOVE."

05:21.389 --> 05:23.791
WHAT-- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

05:25.058 --> 05:26.894
"SEEMINGLY IN LOVE"--
I SAID THAT, DIDN'T I?

05:26.994 --> 05:28.496
( sighs )
TYPICAL.

05:28.596 --> 05:30.030
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

05:30.130 --> 05:32.099
WHY IS THAT TYPICAL?

05:35.736 --> 05:37.438
OH, HE'S MEETING
TODAY WITH SOME GUY

05:37.538 --> 05:40.774
THAT MIGHT COMMISSION
SOME MUSIC FROM HIM.

05:40.874 --> 05:43.511
YOU MAKE IT SOUND
LIKE YOU DON'T THINK
THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

05:43.611 --> 05:45.979
AND HE SAID TO ME
THAT I SHOULD COME
HERE ON MY OWN,

05:46.079 --> 05:49.650
THAT TALKING DOES ME GOOD.
IT'S NOT LIKE JAKE TO SEND
ME HERE ALONE, IS IT?

05:49.750 --> 05:52.953
YOU'VE TURNED HIM INTO
THE NEW AND IMPROVED JAKE,

05:53.053 --> 05:55.489
THE NEW SENSITIVE JAKE.

05:55.589 --> 05:57.891
YOU COULD CUT
THE MUTUAL SUPPORT
THIS WEEK WITH A KNIFE.

05:57.991 --> 06:00.394
"OH, YOU LOOK GREAT.
YOUR MAKEUP LOOKS GOOD.

06:00.494 --> 06:02.996
OH, YOU'LL BE WORKING LATE?
THAT'S FINE. GOOD LUCK."

06:03.096 --> 06:04.798
THE OTHER DAY...
( laughs )

06:04.898 --> 06:06.434
BEFORE A MEETING,
HE ACTUALLY SAID TO ME

06:06.534 --> 06:08.802
"GO GET 'EM!"
( laughing )

06:08.902 --> 06:10.704
ISN'T THAT FUNNY?

06:11.572 --> 06:13.907
W-- WHY IS IT FUNNY?

06:14.007 --> 06:17.377
IT'S JUST SO... SWEET.

06:18.178 --> 06:19.547
AND SWEET ISN'T GOOD?

06:19.647 --> 06:21.582
SWEET'S FATTENING.

06:25.252 --> 06:26.687
AND THEN TWO DAYS AGO
HE SAID TO ME

06:26.787 --> 06:28.589
"WOULD YOU LIKE
TO HAVE SEX WITH ME?"

06:28.689 --> 06:30.323
( laughing )
OH MY-- WOULD I LIKE
TO HAVE SEX WITH HIM?

06:30.424 --> 06:34.528
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?
IT'S LIKE HE WAS OFFERING
ME A CANAPE.

06:34.628 --> 06:36.163
AND THEN HE KEPT WANTING
TO KISS ME AND TOUCH ME

06:36.263 --> 06:38.899
AND... BE ALL LOVING
AND AFFECTIONATE.

06:38.999 --> 06:41.068
HE KEPT SAYING,
"DO YOU LIKE THIS?
DOES THIS FEEL GOOD?"

06:41.168 --> 06:42.803
IT ACTUALLY GOT
VERY TIRESOME.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.872
AND AT THE END,
WHEN HE WAS THROUGH,

06:44.972 --> 06:47.508
I FOUND MYSELF
PATTING HIM ON THE BACK
LIKE I WAS BURPING A BABY,

06:47.608 --> 06:50.210
AND HE KEPT WHISPERING
MY NAME, "AMY, AMY."

06:50.310 --> 06:52.880
IT WAS SUCH
A TURNOFF.

06:52.980 --> 06:55.182
AND WHY WAS THAT
SUCH A TURNOFF?

06:56.584 --> 06:58.418
IT WAS JUST SO...

07:01.922 --> 07:04.424
SO-- SO WHAT, AMY?

07:08.996 --> 07:12.766
IS IT WORSE THAN
WHISPERING "I'M GONNA
KILL YOU" IN YOUR EAR?

07:14.101 --> 07:15.636
MUCH WORSE.

07:15.736 --> 07:17.938
GOD, ALL THAT TENDERNESS.

07:27.715 --> 07:29.650
NOT YOUR CUP OF TEA.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.485
NO.

07:33.320 --> 07:34.988
WHY NOT?

07:35.088 --> 07:37.691
YOU KNOW WHAT?
SEX LIKE THAT IS TERRIBLE.

07:37.791 --> 07:40.694
WHAT WE NEED
IS ANGRY SEX.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.630
THAT'S WHAT WE HAD.
THAT'S WHAT HELD US TOGETHER.

07:42.730 --> 07:44.598
EVEN WHEN WE WANTED TO KILL
EACH OTHER, WE HAD THAT,

07:44.698 --> 07:46.534
PROBABLY BECAUSE
WE WANTED TO KILL EACH OTHER.

07:46.634 --> 07:50.137
THIS TOUCHY-FEELY SEX
WASN'T THE DEAL.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.874
YOU KNOW, THE KIND OF
SEX WE USED TO HAVE,

07:53.974 --> 07:55.576
I COULDN'T EVEN TELL
MY GIRLFRIENDS ABOUT IT.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.711
NOBODY WOULD'VE
BELIEVED ME,

07:57.811 --> 08:00.781
OR ELSE THEY'D
CALL SOCIAL SERVICES
AND HAVE JAKE ARRESTED.

08:00.881 --> 08:02.650
NOW IT'S LIKE
HE'S HAD A LOBOTOMY

08:02.750 --> 08:04.251
OR LIKE HE'S BRAIN-DEAD.

08:04.351 --> 08:07.254
ONLY HE'S NOT BRAIN-DEAD,
HE'S JUST A TERRIBLE FUCK.

08:07.354 --> 08:09.356
IT'S YOUR FAULT.

08:09.456 --> 08:13.894
- IT'S MY FAULT?
- HUH, THE MAN IN TOUCH
WITH HIMSELF.

08:13.994 --> 08:18.265
GOD, MIGHT BE BETTER
IF HE KNOCKED ME
AROUND A BIT.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.703
YOU REALLY THINK
THAT'D BE BETTER?

08:23.403 --> 08:25.438
I DON'T KNOW.

08:25.539 --> 08:27.541
MAYBE I DESERVE IT.

08:32.646 --> 08:34.915
HOW DO YOU LIKE
MY NECKLACE, BY THE WAY?

08:36.717 --> 08:40.053
I THINK IT'S--
IT'S VERY NICE.

08:41.955 --> 08:43.957
IT'S A GIFT.

08:44.057 --> 08:46.459
- FROM JAKE?
- A BULGARI FROM JAKE?

08:46.560 --> 08:49.630
NO, IT'S FROM BEN.
DO YOU REMEMBER BEN, MY BOSS?

08:49.730 --> 08:52.666
OH, YES.
MM-HMM.

08:52.766 --> 08:56.269
I TOLD JAKE THAT
I'D BE GOING BACK
TO THE OFFICE TONIGHT

08:56.369 --> 08:58.071
BECAUSE I HAVE
A CONFERENCE CALL

08:58.171 --> 08:59.573
WITH SOME CLIENTS IN BALI.

08:59.673 --> 09:02.910
I ALSO TOLD HIM THAT
BEN WAS TRAVELING,
BUT THE TRUTH IS

09:03.010 --> 09:06.580
BEN IS PICKING ME UP
FROM HERE AND WE'RE
NOT GOING BACK TO THE OFFICE.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.686
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

09:12.786 --> 09:14.822
WHEREVER THE EVENING
TAKES US.

09:15.823 --> 09:17.825
WHAT DO YOU
THINK OF THAT?

09:20.828 --> 09:22.095
WHAT, DINNER WITH YOUR BOSS?

09:22.195 --> 09:24.531
IT WON'T BE DINNER.
WELL, IT MIGHT INCLUDE DINNER,

09:24.632 --> 09:26.667
BUT THERE'S NO
STOPPING THE REST OF IT.

09:32.205 --> 09:34.141
WHY CAN'T IT BE STOPPED?

09:42.850 --> 09:44.484
DO--

09:44.584 --> 09:46.787
DO YOU WANT ME
TO STOP IT?

09:48.221 --> 09:49.990
IT WON'T DO ANY GOOD.
I KNOW IT'LL HAPPEN.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.125
I MEAN, BEN AND I
ARE INEVITABLE.

09:52.225 --> 09:54.394
THE MINUTE THAT
THE THOUGHT ENTERED MY HEAD,

09:54.494 --> 09:56.930
IT WAS AS IF SOMEBODY HAD
TRIGGERED A TICKING TIME-BOMB.

09:57.030 --> 09:59.733
NOTHING WILL STOP IT,
NO MATTER HOW MANY
BOMB EXPERTS I BRING IN.

09:59.833 --> 10:02.736
YOU CAN'T STOP IT,
NO ONE CAN.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.839
SO, WHO TRIGGERED
THE TIME BOMB?

10:05.939 --> 10:08.175
( sighs )
THE LOUSY SEX.

10:08.275 --> 10:11.378
I WAS IN THE SHOWER--
BY THE WAY, IT'S THE FIRST TIME

10:11.478 --> 10:13.881
I'VE EVER BEEN IN A HURRY
TO GET IN THE SHOWER
AFTER FUCKING JAKE.

10:13.981 --> 10:16.784
AND IT DAWNED ON ME
THAT NO MATTER WHAT I DO...

10:16.884 --> 10:18.085
SOMETHING'S GONNA
HAPPEN WITH HIM.

10:18.185 --> 10:20.153
SO ARE YOU PUNISHING JAKE
FOR THE BAD SEX

10:20.253 --> 10:23.056
OR BECAUSE OF THIS NEW--

10:23.156 --> 10:25.325
THIS NEW TENDERNESS,
THIS NEW...

10:25.425 --> 10:27.260
ATTENTIVENESS
THAT HE'S SHOWN?

10:33.667 --> 10:35.836
TELL ME.
WHY AM I DOING THIS?
WHY CAN'T I STOP?

10:35.936 --> 10:39.006
- YOU HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING YET.
- BUT HE'LL BE HERE IN A MINUTE.

10:42.142 --> 10:45.713
- DO YOU LIKE THIS GUY?
- BEN? HE'S A PRICK,

10:45.813 --> 10:47.647
BUT IT'S--
( sighs )

10:47.748 --> 10:50.183
IT'S LIKE I NEED--

10:53.253 --> 10:54.988
YOU NEED WHAT?

10:57.825 --> 11:00.127
THE EMPLOYEE-
OF-THE-MONTH AWARD.

11:01.261 --> 11:03.263
THE OFFICE-SLUT AWARD.

11:16.944 --> 11:18.879
I-- I'D LIKE TO GO BACK

11:18.979 --> 11:20.948
TO SOMETHING THAT
WE TOUCHED ON LAST WEEK.

11:21.048 --> 11:23.917
YOU-- YOU SAID
THAT YOU WERE--

11:24.017 --> 11:26.486
THAT YOU WERE OVERWEIGHT
WHEN YOU WERE A CHILD.

11:26.586 --> 11:29.022
( laughs )
THAT REALLY CAPTURED
YOUR IMAGINATION, DIDN'T IT?

11:29.122 --> 11:31.992
WELL, I THINK IT'S SOMETHING
THAT WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT.

11:32.092 --> 11:33.894
I KNOW YOU SAID
IT DIDN'T BOTHER YOU,

11:33.994 --> 11:37.564
BUT YOU DID SAY SOMETHING
ABOUT CHILDREN BEING CRUEL.

11:37.664 --> 11:39.800
WELL, I WAS FAT.

11:39.900 --> 11:42.169
NOT OVERWEIGHT, FAT.

11:42.269 --> 11:44.504
MY SISTER WAS
THE OVERWEIGHT ONE.

11:44.604 --> 11:47.307
I'M KIDDING.
MY SISTER'S GORGEOUS.

11:51.678 --> 11:53.146
IT'S REALLY HARD
FOR ME TO BELIEVE

11:53.246 --> 11:56.149
THAT YOU ACTUALLY
EVER WERE...

11:56.249 --> 11:57.650
THIS OVERWEIGHT KID.

11:57.751 --> 12:00.087
IT'S LIKE YOU'VE
ERASED THAT GIRL.

12:03.190 --> 12:05.793
RIGHT AFTER MY FATHER DIED,
I DECIDED TO STOP EATING.

12:05.893 --> 12:08.929
IT'S-- IT'S LIKE
I WOKE UP 45 LBS THINNER.

12:09.029 --> 12:11.464
HOW DO YOU WAKE UP
45 LBS THINNER?

12:11.564 --> 12:12.966
I JUST DIDN'T EAT.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.734
AND I FELT LIKE
IT WAS THE ONE THING

12:14.835 --> 12:16.436
THAT I COULD CONTROL
IN THAT HOUSE.

12:16.536 --> 12:18.872
SOME DAYS I'D JUST HAVE
ONE CRACKER ALL DAY LONG.

12:18.972 --> 12:20.974
AND I'D FEEL
MY STOMACH GET FLATTER

12:21.074 --> 12:24.477
AND I'D HAVE
THIS WONDERFUL SENSE
OF LIGHT-HEADEDNESS,

12:24.577 --> 12:26.646
THIS WONDERFUL HIGH.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.315
( sighs deeply )

12:35.422 --> 12:36.857
WHAT?

12:39.392 --> 12:41.461
DOESN'T MATTER.

12:41.561 --> 12:43.831
NO, GO ON,
FINISH THE THOUGHT.

12:46.033 --> 12:48.668
MY FATHER WAS
A LOVELY MAN--
SWEET, CHARMING.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.871
I LOVED HIM VERY MUCH.

12:54.574 --> 12:56.776
AND YOUR MOTHER?

12:56.877 --> 12:58.979
MY MOTHER'S DEAD.
( laughing )

13:03.550 --> 13:06.086
YOU KNOW THE JOKE
ABOUT THE FARMER
WITH THE TWO COWS?

13:06.186 --> 13:09.256
THE ONE COW GIVES MILK
AND THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T?

13:09.356 --> 13:11.892
- NO.
- NO?

13:11.992 --> 13:14.928
NEVER MIND. ANYWAY,
MY DAD DIED WHEN I WAS 13.

13:15.028 --> 13:17.931
MY MOTHER'S RATHER LIKE
CINDERELLA'S STEPMOTHER

13:18.031 --> 13:20.934
AND MY SISTER'S LIKE
THE EVIL STEPSISTER.

13:21.034 --> 13:22.936
ONCE, WHEN I WAS 13, UM...

13:23.036 --> 13:26.439
MY PARENTS CAME BACK
FROM MILAN WITH TWO
IDENTICAL DRESSES,

13:26.539 --> 13:27.908
VERY VERY BEAUTIFUL ONES.

13:28.008 --> 13:30.543
A RED ONE FOR MARIA,
MY SISTER,

13:30.643 --> 13:32.512
AND A BLUE ONE FOR ME.

13:32.612 --> 13:34.347
MINE, OF COURSE,
DIDN'T FIT ME.

13:34.447 --> 13:36.416
SO, MY MOTHER TOLD HER
TO SWITCH WITH ME

13:36.516 --> 13:38.886
BECAUSE SHE WAS OLDER
AND HERS WAS SLIGHTLY BIGGER.

13:38.986 --> 13:40.587
SHE, OF COURSE,
DIDN'T WANT TO,

13:40.687 --> 13:42.856
SO SHE STARTED
SCREAMING AND SAID
SHE WANTED THE RED DRESS.

13:42.956 --> 13:45.325
IT'S NOT HER FAULT
THAT I'M SO FAT.

13:45.425 --> 13:47.194
AND FINALLY,
SHE THREW THE DRESS AT ME

13:47.294 --> 13:49.129
AND SAID, "WELL THEN,
TAKE IT, FATSO."

13:49.930 --> 13:51.865
SO I STARTED CRYING.

13:51.965 --> 13:54.034
AND MY MOTHER SAID,
"WHAT ARE YOU CRYING FOR NOW?

13:54.134 --> 13:56.203
YOU SHOULD BE GLAD THAT
YOUR SISTER'S DRESS FITS YOU

13:56.303 --> 13:57.971
AND THAT SHE AGREED
TO TRADE DRESSES.

13:58.071 --> 13:59.739
YOU SHOULD THANK HER."

13:59.839 --> 14:03.143
LATER, I HEARD
MY PARENTS ARGUING
AND MY DAD SAID TO MY MOM,

14:03.243 --> 14:05.745
"WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST GET
THEM THE SAME COLOR DRESS?"

14:05.845 --> 14:07.614
AND MY MOTHER STARTED
WHISPERING, SHE SAID,

14:07.714 --> 14:09.749
"I CAN'T BUY
HER RED, SHE--"

14:09.849 --> 14:11.584
I COULDN'T HEAR
HER PROPERLY THEN.

14:11.684 --> 14:15.088
SHE SEEMED LIKE
SHE SAID, "SHE LOOKS
LIKE A WATERMELON IN IT,"

14:15.188 --> 14:16.823
OR "SHE'D LOOK LIKE
A FIRE TRUCK IN IT,"

14:16.924 --> 14:19.592
OR "SHE'D LOOK LIKE
A BEACH BALL" OR--

14:19.692 --> 14:21.328
I COULDN'T HEAR
WHAT SHE SAID.

14:36.043 --> 14:38.211
SO DID YOU EVER
TALK TO YOUR DAD

14:38.311 --> 14:41.248
ABOUT WHAT YOU
MIGHT HAVE HEARD?

14:42.749 --> 14:44.985
NO, I NEVER GOT
A CHANCE.

14:48.055 --> 14:51.091
SO, COULD YOU HAVE--
COULD YOU HAVE TALKED
TO YOUR MOM ABOUT IT?

14:54.694 --> 14:56.763
WHY NOT?

14:56.863 --> 14:58.932
SHE'D SAY THAT I WAS
MAKING THINGS UP.

14:59.032 --> 15:00.767
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID...
( clears throat )

15:00.867 --> 15:04.537
TO MOST OF MY COMPLAINTS.
SHE USED TO CALL ME
THE FABRICATOR.

15:04.637 --> 15:07.174
I HAD A VERY
VIVID IMAGINATION.

15:07.274 --> 15:09.709
I USED TO MAKE THINGS UP.
ONCE, I TOLD HER

15:09.809 --> 15:11.544
THAT I SAW MY SISTER
KISSING THE, UH--

15:11.644 --> 15:13.446
THE GARDENER
BEHIND THE HOUSE.

15:13.546 --> 15:17.150
SHE WENT BALLISTIC.
SHE NEARLY HAD A CORONARY.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.953
YOU KNOW,
ONCE MARIA HAD
A BLIND DATE,

15:20.053 --> 15:21.354
AND BEFORE HE GOT THERE

15:21.454 --> 15:23.690
SHE SAID, "LET'S PLAY
A TRICK ON HIM."

15:23.790 --> 15:25.058
AND SHE TOLD ME
TO OPEN THE DOOR

15:25.158 --> 15:26.526
AND PRETEND THAT I WAS HER.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.328
AND SHE'D WATCH
FROM THE ROOM NEXT DOOR

15:28.428 --> 15:30.397
AND IF SHE DIDN'T LIKE HIM,
SHE JUST WOULDN'T COME OUT

15:30.497 --> 15:34.201
AND I COULD PRETEND THAT
I WAS SICK AND CANCEL THE DATE.

15:34.301 --> 15:37.137
SO WHEN I OPENED THE DOOR,
HE WAS REALLY CUTE.

15:37.237 --> 15:39.906
AND I THOUGHT SHE'D
BE INTERESTED IN HIM.

15:40.007 --> 15:42.075
SO I KEPT TALKING TO HIM

15:42.175 --> 15:44.877
AND PRETENDING TO BE HER
AND CHATTING AWAY.

15:44.978 --> 15:49.782
AND FINALLY, SHE CAME
OUT FROM THE OTHER ROOM
AND SAID, "HI, I'M MARIA."

15:49.882 --> 15:52.352
AND HE WAS
COMPLETELY CONFUSED,

15:52.452 --> 15:55.655
AND I WAS
UTTERLY HUMILIATED.

15:55.755 --> 15:57.624
I-- I WENT SO RED.
ACTUALLY,

15:57.724 --> 15:59.726
I STILL GET EMBARRASSED
WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT TODAY.

15:59.826 --> 16:02.195
AND SHE TOLD HIM
THAT I WAS

16:02.295 --> 16:03.830
JUST CHECKING OUT
HER DATES FOR HER

16:03.930 --> 16:06.333
AND THAT AT IT WAS
ALL JUST A JOKE.

16:10.103 --> 16:11.671
THE THING IS,
I DIDN'T GET THE JOKE.

16:11.771 --> 16:13.240
I MEAN, NOT TILL
YEARS LATER.

16:13.340 --> 16:15.642
I-- I-- I DIDN'T
REALIZE TILL THEN,

16:15.742 --> 16:19.179
THAT ALL SHE REALLY WANTED
WAS TO SEE THE LOOK
OF RELIEF ON HIS FACE

16:19.279 --> 16:21.848
WHEN HE REALIZED THAT
SHE WAS HIS DATE, NOT ME,

16:21.948 --> 16:23.750
THE FATSO.

16:24.884 --> 16:26.553
HILARIOUS, RIGHT?

16:29.789 --> 16:32.559
( sighs )
DON'T WORRY, I GOT BACK
AT HER YEARS LATER.

16:32.659 --> 16:35.262
I MET HIM AT COLLEGE
AND I FUCKED HIS BRAINS OUT.

16:35.362 --> 16:37.464
AND I TOLD HER THAT
HE DIDN'T REMEMBER HER,

16:37.564 --> 16:39.832
AND I'D HAD TO REMIND HIM.
AND SHE SAID, "OH, WHATEVER.

16:39.932 --> 16:41.868
I DUMPED HIM AFTER
TWO DATES ANYWAY."

16:41.968 --> 16:43.370
AND I SAID
"OH, HE TOLD ME

16:43.470 --> 16:46.306
THAT HE DUMPED YOU BECAUSE
YOU SMELLED LIKE TUNA."

16:47.907 --> 16:50.510
- AND IS THAT TRUE?
- NO.

16:50.610 --> 16:53.746
SO REALLY, YOU SETTLED
THAT ACCOUNT IN BED.

16:54.547 --> 16:56.216
I DID INDEED.

17:03.323 --> 17:06.193
AND NOW YOU'RE SETTLING
ANOTHER ACCOUNT IN BED,

17:06.293 --> 17:08.027
WITH JAKE THIS TIME.

17:08.128 --> 17:10.797
WHAT, BECAUSE HE'S BECOME
TOO SENSITIVE FOR YOU?

17:22.942 --> 17:26.846
SO-- SO LET ME MAKE SURE
I HAVE THIS RIGHT.

17:26.946 --> 17:28.781
YOUR FATHER DIED
WHEN YOU WERE 13.

17:28.881 --> 17:33.353
- YES.
- YOU MUST HAVE BEEN
PRETTY DEVASTATED.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.289
I WAS.

17:36.389 --> 17:39.326
HE WAS A LOVELY MAN.
HE WAS AFFECTIONATE AND...

17:39.426 --> 17:41.094
GREAT.

17:42.028 --> 17:44.364
PHYSICALLY AFFECTIONATE?

17:48.000 --> 17:49.569
YEAH.

17:51.204 --> 17:52.872
HE'D COME INTO
OUR ROOM AT NIGHT

17:52.972 --> 17:55.041
WHEN WE WERE SLEEPING AND...

17:55.142 --> 17:56.809
KISS US ON THE EYES.

17:58.678 --> 18:02.215
AND THEN I'D HALF WAKE UP,
I'D SMELL HIS AFTERSHAVE

18:02.315 --> 18:04.884
AND KNOW THAT HE WAS THERE.

18:04.984 --> 18:07.854
AND THEN HE'D
WHISPER IN MY EAR
THAT HE LOVED ME AND...

18:09.489 --> 18:11.824
HE'D HOLD MY FACE
IN HIS HANDS.

18:11.924 --> 18:15.162
HE HAD THESE HUGE HANDS,
LIKE A CONSTRUCTION WORKER.

18:17.797 --> 18:19.232
AND HE WAS JUST...

18:19.332 --> 18:23.436
SO... TENDER AND LOVELY.

18:32.945 --> 18:35.081
AND YET,
WHEN JAKE IS TENDER

18:35.182 --> 18:37.250
AND HE EXPRESSES HIS LOVE
THROUGH TENDERNESS,

18:37.350 --> 18:39.352
IT MAKES YOU ANGRY.

18:40.920 --> 18:43.323
YOU SAID
IT WAS DISGUSTING.

18:45.592 --> 18:48.161
DO YOU THINK THAT MIGHT BE
BECAUSE IT SCARES YOU?

18:48.261 --> 18:49.996
THAT YOU'VE LEARNED
YOU CAN'T TRUST PEOPLE

18:50.096 --> 18:52.265
WHO EXPRESS
THEMSELVES TENDERLY,

18:52.365 --> 18:55.668
THAT THEY SEEM WEAK?

18:55.768 --> 18:59.339
THAT THEY'RE GOING
TO ABANDON YOU, DIE
AND LEAVE YOU BEHIND?

18:59.439 --> 19:01.040
AND SO IN ORDER
TO AVOID THAT,

19:01.140 --> 19:02.942
YOU PROVOKE JAKE.
YOU MAKE HIM ANGRY.

19:03.042 --> 19:06.746
YOU CREATE THESE
SITUATIONS THAT
BRING OUT THE WORST IN HIM

19:06.846 --> 19:09.148
AND HE TREATS YOU BADLY.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.830
BEN'LL BE HERE ANY MINUTE.
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

19:28.868 --> 19:31.838
DO YOU REALLY WANT ME
TO GIVE YOU PERMISSION
TO HAVE SEX WITH YOUR BOSS?

19:31.938 --> 19:33.873
ONCE. JUST ONCE.

19:33.973 --> 19:36.376
JUST TELL ME
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

19:38.911 --> 19:40.280
I THINK IT MIGHT
BE THAT BAD.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.249
BUT YOU'LL EXPLAIN IT
TO JAKE IF HE FINDS OUT.

19:42.349 --> 19:44.317
CAN YOU--
CAN YOU MAKE SENSE
OF IT FOR HIM?

19:44.417 --> 19:46.686
AND WHAT IS IT EXACTLY
THAT YOU WANT ME TO TELL HIM?

19:46.786 --> 19:48.488
THAT I'M FUCKED UP.

19:48.588 --> 19:50.690
THAT I CAN'T HELP MYSELF.
THAT-- THAT IT'S BIGGER THAN ME.

19:50.790 --> 19:52.459
JUST TELL HIM
THAT I'M FUCKED UP.

19:52.559 --> 19:54.193
BUT EVEN IF
JAKE FORGIVES YOU,

19:54.294 --> 19:57.697
DO YOU THINK THAT YOU
CAN FORGIVE YOURSELF?

19:57.797 --> 19:59.666
I ALWAYS FORGIVE MYSELF.

19:59.766 --> 20:03.102
THAT'S MY PROBLEM.
I-- I JUST CLOSE MY EYES

20:03.202 --> 20:04.871
BEFORE I GO
TO SLEEP AT NIGHT

20:04.971 --> 20:06.138
AND I ASK GOD
FOR FORGIVENESS

20:06.239 --> 20:08.308
AND I FORGIVE MYSELF
FOR EVERYTHING.

20:13.112 --> 20:15.748
EVEN THE UNFORGIVABLE
THINGS, I...

20:15.848 --> 20:17.317
NEVER GET PUNISHED.

20:17.417 --> 20:20.720
YOU THINK THAT
SEX WITH REEVES
WILL GO UNPUNISHED?

20:20.820 --> 20:23.390
WHO'S GONNA PUNISH ME?

20:23.490 --> 20:26.326
WELL, MAYBE YOU'VE ALREADY
STARTED TO PUNISH YOURSELF.

20:27.827 --> 20:30.062
DO YOU REALLY THINK
THAT SLEEPING WITH REEVES

20:30.162 --> 20:32.299
IS GONNA BRING BACK
THE GOOD OLD RELIABLE

20:32.399 --> 20:34.233
ANGRY, CONTROLLING JAKE?

20:34.334 --> 20:36.903
THE-- THE ONE WHO FIGHTS YOU
AND THREATENS YOU?

20:39.105 --> 20:40.907
I DON'T KNOW.

20:41.007 --> 20:43.075
AND NOW THAT HE'S
EXPRESSING HIS LOVE
THROUGH TENDERNESS,

20:43.175 --> 20:46.746
- DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU
DESERVE THAT LOVE--
- IT'S NOT LOVE.

20:48.815 --> 20:52.118
IT'S NEEDINESS.
IT'S WEAKNESS.
IT'S UNBEARABLE.

20:52.218 --> 20:53.786
SO IT'S ONLY LOVE
IF HE CHASES YOU,

20:53.886 --> 20:56.589
STALKS YOU, TAPES YOU,
IS JEALOUS OF YOU.
IS THAT IT?

21:02.228 --> 21:04.030
I THINK YOU NEED
TO LOOK AT THIS

21:04.130 --> 21:05.932
A LITTLE MORE
CAREFULLY, AMY.

21:13.506 --> 21:15.007
IT'S LIKE IT'S
HAPPENED ALREADY.

21:15.107 --> 21:19.278
BUT IT HASN'T
HAPPENED ALREADY.
YOU STILL HAVE A CHOICE.

21:19.379 --> 21:21.648
NOTHING HAPPENS
WITHOUT YOU.

21:32.692 --> 21:34.594
I HAVE TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

21:58.918 --> 22:01.554
( phone ringing )

22:04.223 --> 22:06.325
Hi, it's Jake.
Leave a message.

22:06.426 --> 22:09.295
- ( beeps )
- HEY, JAKE, IT'S ME.

22:09.396 --> 22:12.198
UM, IT'S--
IT'S NOTHING IMPORTANT.

22:12.298 --> 22:14.434
I JUST THOUGHT
I MIGHT CATCH YOU.

22:14.534 --> 22:16.803
I JUST WANTED
TO HEAR YOUR VOICE.

22:18.004 --> 22:19.806
OKAY, TALK TO YOU LATER.

22:19.906 --> 22:21.574
BYE.

22:36.723 --> 22:40.560
( theme music playing )
