WEBVTT

00:05.506 --> 00:07.497
(breathing shakily)

00:11.053 --> 00:14.671
North, West, South, report.

00:14.765 --> 00:16.676
(walkie-talkie clicks)

00:16.767 --> 00:19.475
<i>Rick: Hey. Hey.</i>

00:20.687 --> 00:23.349
What does that mean?

00:23.440 --> 00:25.147
What I said.

00:26.985 --> 00:29.226
You "hope" the guy makes it.

00:31.114 --> 00:32.900
That's not enough.

00:33.992 --> 00:36.450
- If you give a shit...
- Carl.

00:36.537 --> 00:39.825
...if you care, you do something.

00:39.915 --> 00:42.782
You don't just "hope."

00:42.876 --> 00:45.493
It takes more than that.

00:45.587 --> 00:47.328
That's what I meant.

00:52.511 --> 00:54.422
There's gonna be something
after the fight's over.

00:54.513 --> 00:57.505
<i>Rick: Not for everyone.</i>

00:57.599 --> 01:00.136
Carl: <i>Okay,</i> yeah, but...

01:00.227 --> 01:02.059
<i>what about for you?</i>

01:27.087 --> 01:28.794
Different from picture.

01:28.880 --> 01:30.871
(machine-gun fire)

01:33.343 --> 01:34.879
Jadis!

01:34.970 --> 01:37.052
It's coming from the window!

01:37.139 --> 01:39.847
We hit it and fall... back.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.924
(machine-gun fire continues)

01:43.854 --> 01:46.437
(vehicle approaches)

01:55.032 --> 01:57.615
- Rick: Go!
- (engine revs)

01:58.702 --> 02:00.113
They got out.

02:00.203 --> 02:01.693
It hasn't been long.
We have to warn everyone.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.199
- They're gonna hit back.
- We can get the cars

02:03.290 --> 02:04.951
near the East lookout and split up.

02:05.042 --> 02:06.373
Jerry: Might have to find other rides.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.371
The snipers
probably used theirs to get away.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.329
I don't think they got away.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.875
You're gonna live, Dad.

02:18.680 --> 02:21.012
Why are we doing this?

02:21.099 --> 02:23.591
Why are we fighting them?

02:23.685 --> 02:25.221
So it isn't like how they want it,

02:25.312 --> 02:27.519
with everyone working for them,

02:27.606 --> 02:29.392
everyone living for them?

02:31.902 --> 02:34.143
We're fighting so it's all of us
working together

02:34.237 --> 02:37.901
for something more than
just killing other people.

02:37.991 --> 02:42.110
Well, you think
we're gonna be out there,

02:42.204 --> 02:44.241
picking strawberries with Negan?

02:44.331 --> 02:46.322
If that's what it takes.

02:46.416 --> 02:48.748
It's more than just hope.

02:48.835 --> 02:51.452
What, are we just gonna kill all of them?

02:54.883 --> 02:59.002
Finding some way forward, that's harder.

02:59.096 --> 03:01.053
That's something more.

03:02.766 --> 03:04.803
Dad, that's how it's got to be.

03:53.525 --> 03:55.516
(Negan whistling)

04:02.868 --> 04:04.859
(Negan whistling)

04:13.211 --> 04:14.827
(theme music playing)

05:06.181 --> 05:08.218
They have to talk to us, right?

05:09.351 --> 05:12.139
After coming all this way?

05:15.315 --> 05:17.602
Sorry. I was just...

05:19.778 --> 05:21.519
What?

05:21.613 --> 05:22.899
Uh...

05:24.908 --> 05:28.492
Eric and I used to take trips like this...

05:28.578 --> 05:30.785
back when we were looking for people

05:30.872 --> 05:32.863
to bring to Alexandria.

05:35.210 --> 05:37.326
We drove to the Hilltop
just a few days ago

05:37.420 --> 05:39.878
and... helped armor those cars.

05:39.965 --> 05:44.050
He was always right there,
where you are now.

05:46.054 --> 05:47.670
I was just...

05:47.764 --> 05:49.346
remembering that.

05:49.432 --> 05:51.093
I'm sorry.

05:52.310 --> 05:55.052
I need to make sure
he died for a reason.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.774
Tell me what you were saying?

06:00.861 --> 06:02.693
I was, uh...

06:02.779 --> 06:05.692
I was just thinking about Oceanside.

06:05.782 --> 06:07.648
Wondering if they'll talk to us.

06:07.742 --> 06:09.574
I hope so.

06:09.661 --> 06:11.368
We got to try not to scare them.

06:11.454 --> 06:13.445
Tara said that, up until her,

06:13.540 --> 06:15.451
they killed on sight.

06:18.336 --> 06:19.576
It's going to be a risk.

06:22.007 --> 06:24.920
We need to have them be a part of this.

06:25.010 --> 06:27.217
We just have to convince them.

06:28.930 --> 06:31.262
We have to.

06:33.184 --> 06:36.893
- We should've brought guns for them.
- We have to hold on to those guns.

06:38.315 --> 06:39.897
I could give Cyndie mine.

06:39.983 --> 06:42.816
You're gonna need your gun, Enid.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.189
Right.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.235
I just want it to end before that.

06:50.368 --> 06:52.325
I do, too.

06:59.044 --> 07:00.785
You know how to drive?

07:01.963 --> 07:03.545
Uh, yeah.

07:03.632 --> 07:06.090
Well, sort of.

07:06.176 --> 07:07.837
I'm better than Carl, anyways.

07:07.928 --> 07:10.090
(chuckles)

07:18.396 --> 07:19.932
Aaron: Why are you turning?

07:20.023 --> 07:22.731
We're supposed to be going straight.

07:22.817 --> 07:25.354
Uh, I just want to check something out.

07:26.947 --> 07:30.440
Maybe it's just about giving them
something they can use.

07:30.533 --> 07:32.695
(chuckles)

07:32.786 --> 07:34.697
You're right.

07:34.788 --> 07:37.496
We can't show up empty-handed.

07:37.582 --> 07:40.665
- Social graces.
- (chuckles)

08:01.231 --> 08:03.973
We'll be back soon.
I'll bring your daddy, too, okay?

08:05.276 --> 08:07.358
Can you say bye-bye?

08:07.445 --> 08:09.812
<i>'</i> BYE-bye.
- Bye.

08:20.250 --> 08:21.786
- Hey.
- Hi.

08:22.794 --> 08:25.377
I'm glad you came back.

08:25.463 --> 08:27.500
It's better we go out there together.

08:27.590 --> 08:29.706
It worked.

08:29.801 --> 08:32.087
We'll roll in, tell them to give up.

08:32.178 --> 08:33.418
They're gonna give up.

08:36.558 --> 08:38.048
I'm sorry.

08:38.143 --> 08:39.884
I couldn't.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.844
Don't be.

08:42.938 --> 08:44.680
It worked.

09:58.723 --> 10:00.805
(exhales sharply)

10:03.103 --> 10:04.343
It worked.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.892
We opened it up for the walkers.
They're in.

10:12.821 --> 10:14.186
Okay-

10:14.280 --> 10:15.691
So we'll finish it, just like we planned.

10:16.366 --> 10:17.982
Yeah.

10:18.076 --> 10:19.987
You stop by that warehouse
on your way back?

10:20.995 --> 10:23.327
Find any guns, ammo?

10:23.414 --> 10:24.825
Uh...

10:26.084 --> 10:27.324
no, nothing heavy.

10:27.418 --> 10:30.126
Just some stun grenades,
smoke grenades...

10:30.213 --> 10:32.454
air horn, probably for redirects.

10:32.549 --> 10:34.836
Cool.

10:34.926 --> 10:36.337
Well, after they surrender,

10:36.427 --> 10:38.168
we should use this stuff
to redirect the herd.

10:38.263 --> 10:40.129
We should take it with us.

10:43.184 --> 10:44.515
(grunts)

10:48.398 --> 10:50.014
Yeah. That's good.

10:50.108 --> 10:51.269
Yeah, stack it up.

10:51.359 --> 10:53.646
Yeah, keep going.

10:53.736 --> 10:54.817
Great.

10:54.904 --> 10:57.316
What about that
really heavy-looking crate?

10:57.407 --> 10:58.568
Awesome.

10:58.658 --> 10:59.819
What about the air horn?

10:59.909 --> 11:02.446
Cool. Okay.

11:02.537 --> 11:03.743
Sure.

11:04.539 --> 11:07.031
(straining) Yeah, I got it.

11:19.262 --> 11:21.003
(engine shuts off)

11:34.194 --> 11:35.901
(engine shuts off)

11:42.160 --> 11:43.821
This good?

11:43.912 --> 11:46.370
I don't know.

11:46.456 --> 11:49.118
It's as good a place as any.

11:49.792 --> 11:51.123
Yeah.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.168
(crickets chirping)

12:46.307 --> 12:47.593
(Aaron grunts)

12:47.684 --> 12:50.472
Woman:
You shouldn't have come here.

12:51.646 --> 12:53.387
(body thuds)

12:55.608 --> 12:57.940
(groans)

12:58.027 --> 13:00.689
Woman: Drop it! Now!

13:00.780 --> 13:02.862
Get up. Slow.

13:04.325 --> 13:06.441
Cyndie: Grandma?

13:06.536 --> 13:08.197
Grandma!

13:11.457 --> 13:14.040
(crying)

13:16.671 --> 13:18.708
Oh, God!

13:18.798 --> 13:20.789
(crying continues)

13:25.888 --> 13:27.219
No!

13:31.269 --> 13:33.260
(crickets chirping)

13:40.111 --> 13:42.318
Michonne: Carl.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.490
I've been lookin' for you.

13:48.536 --> 13:49.947
We're about ready to head out.

13:50.038 --> 13:51.369
What are you doing?

13:52.999 --> 13:55.081
I'm helping someone.

13:56.878 --> 13:58.334
A traveler.

14:01.215 --> 14:02.501
In the sewer?

14:04.469 --> 14:06.460
(metallic clanging)

14:09.932 --> 14:11.093
(feedback)

14:11.184 --> 14:12.800
Negan on P.A.:
You may be wondering

14:12.894 --> 14:16.228
<i>why the hell your lookouts
didn't sound the alarm.</i>

14:16.314 --> 14:18.521
<i>See, we are polite.</i>

14:18.608 --> 14:20.724
<i>I mean, I don't know
when they're gonna wake up</i>

14:20.818 --> 14:21.899
<i>from that kinda shot,</i>

14:21.986 --> 14:23.852
<i>but they should wake up.</i>

14:23.946 --> 14:26.153
<i>So let's just cut through the cow shit--</i>

14:26.240 --> 14:27.947
you lose.

14:28.034 --> 14:29.866
<i>It's over.</i>

14:29.952 --> 14:31.989
So <i>you're gonna line up
in front of your little houses,</i>

14:32.080 --> 14:33.866
<i>and you're gonna work up some apologies,</i>

14:33.956 --> 14:36.118
<i>and then the person with the lamest one</i>

14:36.209 --> 14:37.699
<i>is gonna get killed.</i>

14:37.794 --> 14:39.580
<i>Then I kill Rick in front of everybody,</i>

14:39.670 --> 14:41.126
<i>and we move on.</i>

14:41.214 --> 14:45.208
<i>You have three-- count 'em,
three minutes to open this gate,</i>

14:45.301 --> 14:47.508
<i>or we start bombing the shit out of you!</i>

14:47.595 --> 14:49.757
They got out.

14:49.847 --> 14:51.383
- (Negan whistling)
- Come on.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.100
Michonne.

15:00.191 --> 15:01.556
Come on!

15:03.277 --> 15:05.894
(whistling continues)

15:19.377 --> 15:21.493
(crashing, tires screeching)

15:54.662 --> 15:55.948
(explosion in distance)

15:56.038 --> 15:57.620
(people screaming)

15:57.707 --> 15:59.323
(Ezekiel grunts)

15:59.417 --> 16:01.408
(people screaming)

16:04.422 --> 16:05.628
(explosion)

16:05.715 --> 16:07.877
Man: Spread out and find him!

16:23.733 --> 16:26.020
(sighs)

16:26.110 --> 16:28.693
Do you think they'll surrender?

16:28.779 --> 16:30.520
They will.

16:30.615 --> 16:32.197
Eventually.

16:33.493 --> 16:34.824
Not now?

16:34.911 --> 16:37.118
Would we give up that quick?

16:39.290 --> 16:41.531
No, we wouldn't.

16:41.626 --> 16:43.492
Damn straight.

16:44.545 --> 16:46.752
Maggie: They don't surrender today,
they will soon.

16:46.839 --> 16:49.206
Just need to run out of food...

16:49.300 --> 16:50.882
water...

16:52.136 --> 16:54.377
choices.

17:02.688 --> 17:04.270
Slow down.

17:07.818 --> 17:10.059
Neil: What is it?

17:10.154 --> 17:12.270
Tree in the road wasn't there before.

17:12.365 --> 17:15.073
Could've fallen on its own.

17:15.159 --> 17:16.866
Trees do that.

17:16.953 --> 17:18.785
It's them.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.703
Something happened.

17:30.424 --> 17:31.914
(engine shuts off)

17:32.009 --> 17:34.341
Bertie, turn around.

17:37.139 --> 17:38.675
Bertie!

17:40.601 --> 17:42.763
Dianne: Maggie.

17:51.195 --> 17:53.186
(vehicle approaching)

18:25.479 --> 18:28.141
(vehicle doors open)

18:28.232 --> 18:30.269
Neil: Oh, shit.

19:11.609 --> 19:14.226
(truck door opens)

19:19.241 --> 19:21.152
Hello, hello, hello!

19:23.663 --> 19:25.449
Ahh.

19:26.540 --> 19:29.749
What a damn nice night.

19:29.835 --> 19:31.246
- (Negan whistling)
- Carl: You need to make it look

19:31.337 --> 19:32.418
like we're escaping out back.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.041
Get to the woods,
halfway to the quarry,

19:34.131 --> 19:35.337
and cut the lights.

19:35.424 --> 19:36.630
Get enough of a lead on them,

19:36.717 --> 19:38.708
hit them, and get away on foot.

19:38.803 --> 19:40.589
You know where we'll be.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.887
Just have to get the guns,
get everyone else here,

19:42.973 --> 19:44.088
and we'll meet you there.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.174
Negan on P.A.: Two minutes, people!

19:46.268 --> 19:47.633
<i>Dig deep-</i>

19:47.728 --> 19:50.265
<i>I want these apologies to be memorable.</i>

19:50.356 --> 19:52.893
<i>Bonus points for creativity.</i>

19:52.983 --> 19:54.690
<i>Work up a poem, sing a song.</i>

19:54.777 --> 19:55.892
<i>I love that shit.</i>

19:55.986 --> 19:57.192
Get 90mg-

19:57.279 --> 19:59.691
There's gonna people in the infirmary.
They're gonna need your help.

19:59.782 --> 20:01.568
- (Negan whistling)
- Look, we got guns.

20:01.659 --> 20:03.445
- We can fight them.
- We will, but not now.

20:03.536 --> 20:04.742
Carl's right.

20:04.829 --> 20:07.036
Carl, we can't just let them
have this place.

20:07.123 --> 20:08.409
We can.

20:08.499 --> 20:10.831
All you need to do is survive tonight.

20:10.918 --> 20:13.706
This is my show. You said it.

20:13.796 --> 20:16.163
This is my plan, and you're gonna do it.

20:16.257 --> 20:17.372
You're all gonna do it.

20:17.466 --> 20:18.956
So let's go!

20:19.051 --> 20:20.792
Negan on P.A.: One minute!

20:20.886 --> 20:23.253
<i>One minute!</i>

20:46.787 --> 20:49.074
<i>Well, here we are.</i>

20:49.165 --> 20:51.452
<i>I didn't want it to come to this.</i>

20:51.542 --> 20:53.624
<i>Much rather would've been
at home tonight.</i>

20:53.711 --> 20:55.748
<i>But you folks wanted
to order off the menu.</i>

20:55.838 --> 20:57.920
<i>And look at that!</i>

20:58.007 --> 21:00.248
<i>Now you have to eat shit.</i>

21:01.886 --> 21:04.218
<i>God knows I didn't want to be
the one sewing it up.</i>

21:10.352 --> 21:12.639
<i>The Kingdom and everyone in it</i>

21:12.730 --> 21:15.222
<i>now belongs to Negan.</i>

21:15.316 --> 21:16.932
<i>Moving forward,</i>

21:17.026 --> 21:21.020
<i>everything that you produce
will belong to us.</i>

21:21.113 --> 21:22.444
<i>We're going to give you</i>

21:22.531 --> 21:25.114
<i>just enough to keep you working,</i>

21:25.201 --> 21:28.319
<i>but you're probably
going to lose the freshman 15</i>

21:28.412 --> 21:29.618
<i>Pretty quick.</i>

21:29.705 --> 21:31.867
<i>In addition,</i>

21:31.957 --> 21:34.449
<i>all able-bodied men and women</i>

21:34.543 --> 21:37.160
<i>will also be transported
to the Sanctuary</i>

21:37.254 --> 21:40.212
<i>to see to its repair and refurbishment.</i>

21:40.299 --> 21:42.006
And...

21:42.760 --> 21:45.548
<i>since you made our former home</i>

21:45.638 --> 21:48.801
<i>a goddamn mess of death and the dead,</i>

21:48.891 --> 21:52.134
<i>we'll be hanging our hat here.</i>

22:08.035 --> 22:10.652
Simon: You all know the drill.

22:10.746 --> 22:13.989
Due to your recent decisions,
everything has changed.

22:14.083 --> 22:16.950
And yet, nothin' has changed.

22:19.088 --> 22:21.420
Everyone needs to hand over their guns.

22:25.845 --> 22:28.462
Gary, shoot that beautiful bastard

22:28.556 --> 22:29.842
if anyone tries anything.

22:29.932 --> 22:32.424
Same goes for everyone in the cars.

22:56.083 --> 22:57.573
(guns cock)

22:57.668 --> 22:59.875
Negan on P.A.: Okey-dokey.

22:59.962 --> 23:02.499
<i>Brought this on yourself, Rick.</i>

23:02.590 --> 23:04.877
<i>See, I was willing to work with you.</i>

23:04.967 --> 23:06.799
<i>All you had to do</i>

23:06.886 --> 23:09.878
<i>was follow a few very simple rules.</i>

23:09.972 --> 23:12.054
<i>But now...</i>

23:12.141 --> 23:16.135
<i>Well, now I see that you got to go.</i>

23:16.228 --> 23:19.687
<i>Scorched earth, you dick!</i>

23:19.773 --> 23:21.059
Carl: He's not home.

23:21.150 --> 23:23.938
<i>Oh-ho-holy shit!</i>

23:24.028 --> 23:25.939
<i>Everybody hold your fire.</i>

23:26.030 --> 23:28.271
<i>It's Carl.</i>

23:28.365 --> 23:30.231
<i>Look at you.</i>

23:30.326 --> 23:33.990
<i>Answering the door like a big boy.</i>

23:34.079 --> 23:36.571
<i>lam so proud.</i>

23:36.665 --> 23:39.407
<i>Daddy's not home, huh?</i>

23:39.501 --> 23:40.991
<i>Well, I guess he's gonna get back</i>

23:41.086 --> 23:42.793
<i>to a big old smoky surprise.</i>

23:42.880 --> 23:44.996
There's families in here.

23:45.090 --> 23:46.580
Kids.

23:46.675 --> 23:48.916
My little sister.

23:50.804 --> 23:53.011
<i>Well, that shit just breaks my heart.</i>

23:53.974 --> 23:55.965
<i>There's kids at the Sanctuary.</i>

23:56.060 --> 23:57.676
<i>You must've seen 'em.</i>

23:58.979 --> 24:02.017
<i>Even had a little baby
at one of the outposts.</i>

24:02.107 --> 24:04.690
<i>I wonder what happened to her.</i>

24:12.701 --> 24:14.783
None of this shit's fair, kid.

24:17.206 --> 24:19.368
Hell, you know that.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.699
You had to kill your own mom.

24:23.253 --> 24:26.166
That is screwed up.

24:27.257 --> 24:29.168
Ergo, we need someone in charge

24:29.259 --> 24:30.841
who's willing to do whatever it takes

24:30.928 --> 24:33.465
to make sure that shit doesn't happen.

24:35.057 --> 24:37.139
Oh. Wait.

24:38.560 --> 24:40.517
- That's me.
- Carl: Bad stuff does happen,

24:40.604 --> 24:41.935
but we can figure this out.

24:42.022 --> 24:43.057
We can stop this.

24:43.148 --> 24:45.856
Negan: Oh, now you want to talk?

24:45.943 --> 24:47.729
See, your dad had it that I died,

24:47.820 --> 24:50.232
no matter what.

24:50.322 --> 24:52.188
He gave my people a choice.

24:53.158 --> 24:54.648
Not me.

24:55.285 --> 24:57.652
Now we're gonna need
a new understanding.

24:57.746 --> 25:00.329
Apologies, punish--

25:00.416 --> 25:01.952
Kill me.

25:14.263 --> 25:16.004
What did you say?

25:16.098 --> 25:19.011
If you have to kill someone,

25:19.101 --> 25:21.718
if there has to be punishment,
then kill me.

25:24.606 --> 25:27.223
I'm serious.

25:30.112 --> 25:32.023
You wanna die?

25:33.323 --> 25:35.314
No, I don't.

25:37.161 --> 25:38.651
But I will.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.701
It's gonna happen.

25:44.376 --> 25:48.415
And-- if me dying could stop this,

25:48.505 --> 25:50.337
if it can make things different--

25:50.424 --> 25:53.416
for us, for you,

25:53.510 --> 25:56.047
for all those other kids--
it'd be worth it.

25:59.808 --> 26:02.175
I mean, was this the plan?

26:04.646 --> 26:06.978
Was it supposed to be this way?

26:08.984 --> 26:10.941
Is this who you wanted to be?

26:32.883 --> 26:34.169
(guns cock)

26:37.262 --> 26:39.754
Cars aren't gonna be enough, D.
We should've had the trucks.

26:39.848 --> 26:41.680
No, it'll hold.

26:41.767 --> 26:43.758
Just get ready for cleanup.

26:47.523 --> 26:49.685
(machine-gun fire)

26:52.319 --> 26:55.027
Well, I'll be damned.
Come on! Let's get 'em!

26:55.114 --> 26:56.775
Got a convoy out. We're on 'em.

27:13.298 --> 27:15.790
Negan: Son of a bitch, Carl!

27:15.884 --> 27:17.124
Was that just a play?!

27:17.219 --> 27:19.631
I thought we were havin' a moment,
you little asshole!

27:19.721 --> 27:21.337
Bombs away!

27:32.234 --> 27:33.816
(body thuds)

28:22.659 --> 28:26.527
Gavin on megaphone:
Now, there's one last piece <i>of</i> business.

28:26.622 --> 28:29.080
<i>There's one person here</i>

28:29.166 --> 28:32.454
<i>who has to answer for all of this.</i>

28:34.546 --> 28:36.287
<i>Ezekiel.</i>

28:36.381 --> 28:37.871
<i>I need him.</i>

28:37.966 --> 28:40.799
<i>We haven't found him yet.</i>

28:40.886 --> 28:44.049
<i>I don't expect anyone to give him up.</i>

28:44.139 --> 28:47.006
<i>But I will say,
to do yourselves a favor</i>

28:47.100 --> 28:49.842
<i>and cooperate now.</i>

28:55.651 --> 28:57.767
<i>We didn't see any goons with dreadlocks</i>

28:57.861 --> 28:59.351
<i>back at what was left of the homestead,</i>

28:59.446 --> 29:01.232
<i>so he's gotta be here.</i>

29:08.247 --> 29:10.830
<i>There are rules, and he broke them!</i>

29:10.916 --> 29:14.625
<i>And if you do not give him up right now,</i>

29:14.711 --> 29:20.252
<i>this... moves into something traumatic.</i>

29:22.010 --> 29:23.751
<i>I don't want that.</i>

29:31.478 --> 29:33.640
<i>Don't make this any worse
than it already is.</i>

29:33.730 --> 29:35.687
<i>There's goddamn kids here.</i>

29:35.774 --> 29:37.856
<i>They don't need to see this shit.</i>

29:49.454 --> 29:50.694
<i>All right.</i>

29:53.417 --> 29:55.454
<i>You got five minutes.</i>

29:55.544 --> 29:57.126
<i>Then it's Megan's way.</i>

29:59.214 --> 30:00.796
<i>And that's on you.</i>

30:01.883 --> 30:03.669
<i>Not me.</i>

30:03.760 --> 30:06.468
(crickets chirping)

30:06.555 --> 30:09.798
How'd you get out?

30:09.891 --> 30:12.178
Three guesses.

30:14.938 --> 30:18.556
Well, let's just say we figured it out.

30:21.028 --> 30:22.610
- What'd you do to the others--
- Oh, yes!

30:22.696 --> 30:24.312
That's exactly where I was going next.

30:24.406 --> 30:28.070
Right now, Kingdom is getting
its innards splayed out

30:28.160 --> 30:29.992
for the world to see.

30:30.078 --> 30:33.287
And the Saviors will be
taking possession of that property,

30:33.373 --> 30:35.455
starting tonight.

30:35.542 --> 30:37.704
Same with Alexandria.

30:37.794 --> 30:39.626
As long as they don't
make it complicated.

30:39.713 --> 30:41.499
(chuckles)

30:42.549 --> 30:44.381
But Hilltop?

30:44.468 --> 30:45.799
The farmers?

30:45.886 --> 30:49.004
The breadbasket
of our nascent civilization?

30:49.097 --> 30:50.929
It's your lucky day.

30:52.934 --> 30:55.517
You've been chosen to keep producing.

30:59.858 --> 31:04.944
My boss doesn't like killing
as a volume business.

31:05.030 --> 31:07.943
I personally have a different view of it.

31:09.284 --> 31:11.321
I'm more results-oriented.

31:12.496 --> 31:14.783
Whatever it takes,

31:14.873 --> 31:16.784
that's more my speed.

31:18.794 --> 31:21.411
Maybe I am too binary.

31:21.505 --> 31:23.291
But it's not my call,

31:23.382 --> 31:25.965
so I'm choosing to embrace
what's within my control.

31:26.051 --> 31:28.884
In fact, I'm doubling down.

31:30.222 --> 31:33.135
Gregory made a little bit
of a fool out of me

31:33.225 --> 31:34.715
in front of the big man,

31:34.810 --> 31:38.519
so I am hoping that you are the one

31:38.605 --> 31:39.891
to make things right.

31:39.981 --> 31:41.972
(music plays in distance)

31:46.655 --> 31:49.067
You hear that?

31:49.157 --> 31:52.491
I need you to shift into active listening.

31:55.664 --> 31:58.531
Eugene!

31:58.625 --> 32:00.707
Who, by the way,

32:00.794 --> 32:02.876
I was admittedly skeptical of,

32:02.963 --> 32:06.251
but, man, worked out like gangbusters.

32:07.342 --> 32:09.208
He helped us get out of the situation

32:09.302 --> 32:12.010
with the masses of the cold and impolite.

32:12.097 --> 32:15.180
And now my guys are leading
the rest of the herd away.

32:18.145 --> 32:20.261
So...

32:20.355 --> 32:22.437
this can go one of two ways.

32:23.400 --> 32:27.359
One, I can kill this likable gent

32:27.446 --> 32:29.278
on his knees over there,

32:29.364 --> 32:31.651
drag you out of this car,

32:31.741 --> 32:34.574
and put you in this box.

32:34.661 --> 32:36.243
Hmm?

32:38.874 --> 32:42.913
In which you will not
suffocate to death...

32:43.003 --> 32:46.291
like your friend Sasha.

32:49.426 --> 32:53.670
And then we take you to Hilltop,

32:53.763 --> 32:55.595
gather everyone up,

32:55.682 --> 32:58.299
and kill you in front of the whole place.

32:59.811 --> 33:01.802
And then drag you back to Sanctuary

33:01.897 --> 33:05.140
and put on the spike in front of HQ.

33:05.233 --> 33:09.022
And then my people
will lead the walker herd

33:09.112 --> 33:12.275
to the Hilltop and pull off the same move

33:12.365 --> 33:16.484
that your people tried
unsuccessfully at our place.

33:16.578 --> 33:19.036
(scoffs)

33:19.122 --> 33:22.581
What a pain in the ass
for everyone concerned.

33:25.045 --> 33:26.627
Hmm?

33:30.884 --> 33:35.424
Or two, you turn around, go home,

33:35.514 --> 33:37.926
start watering that sorghum,

33:38.016 --> 33:41.099
save everyone, and, most importantly, me,

33:41.186 --> 33:43.723
a lot of trouble.

33:45.106 --> 33:47.598
And, yeah...

33:47.692 --> 33:50.605
we're gonna have to kill
one of your people.

33:51.988 --> 33:53.854
But then we're aces.

33:57.786 --> 33:59.743
Simon: Nah, Gary.

34:02.415 --> 34:03.576
I got this.

34:03.667 --> 34:05.783
- (gunshot)
- (glass shatters)

34:11.257 --> 34:13.465
I just really needed you

34:13.552 --> 34:15.759
to know what I was talkin' about.

34:15.844 --> 34:18.632
- (breathes shakily)
- I need you to smell it.

34:18.723 --> 34:21.511
Now tell me I don't got to kill

34:21.601 --> 34:23.683
this gent with the lustrous mane.

34:23.770 --> 34:25.726
Tell me I don't got to go down the line!

34:25.813 --> 34:28.272
Tell me, Maggie!

34:28.358 --> 34:29.974
_ Gary!
<i>'</i> No!

34:37.367 --> 34:39.449
You don't need to do any of it.

34:44.081 --> 34:46.244
I just want to ask you a favor.

34:49.545 --> 34:51.536
What is that?

34:51.630 --> 34:54.293
I'd like that box.

34:54.384 --> 34:56.625
Take Neil home, to bury him in.

35:04.311 --> 35:06.052
Favor granted.

35:21.286 --> 35:24.153
(truck door opens, closes)

35:40.055 --> 35:41.045
(Clicks)

35:52.359 --> 35:53.724
(bed creaks)

36:13.672 --> 36:15.834
(exhales sharply)

36:36.444 --> 36:39.436
(breathes deeply)

36:45.495 --> 36:47.486
(exhales shallowly)

37:31.458 --> 37:33.825
(explosion in distance)

37:39.466 --> 37:41.628
(explosion)

38:02.655 --> 38:05.443
(glass shatters)

39:03.341 --> 39:06.254
Tara: They didn't get out because of
what we did with the truck.

39:08.221 --> 39:11.339
Even if they did,
it was just a mistake.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.261
And I made one, too.

39:15.019 --> 39:16.680
If I hadn't gone to
the Sanctuary to kill Negan,

39:16.771 --> 39:18.682
maybe Sasha would still be alive.

39:20.316 --> 39:22.557
Maybe she would've gone herself.

39:22.652 --> 39:25.019
Maybe everything would've ended up
going exactly the same way.

39:26.531 --> 39:29.319
I didn't want you guys to do it,
but maybe you needed to.

39:29.409 --> 39:33.243
Maybe you needed to play things out
to figure shit out.

39:34.622 --> 39:36.784
Where the hell are they?

39:39.335 --> 39:40.746
(vehicles approaching)

39:55.810 --> 39:57.050
Stop the car.

39:57.145 --> 39:59.227
I just want to take a closer look.

39:59.314 --> 40:00.896
D, stop the damn car!

40:00.982 --> 40:03.223
You're leading the trucks right into it!

40:03.318 --> 40:04.900
You're gonna get us killed!

40:09.741 --> 40:11.072
(tires screech)

40:11.159 --> 40:12.365
NQW!

40:55.620 --> 40:57.952
That's why you didn't want
to block the gate with the trucks.

40:58.039 --> 41:00.952
That's why you drove right up to this!

41:01.042 --> 41:02.908
It was you!

41:03.002 --> 41:03.992
All of it!

41:05.755 --> 41:07.621
You tell them to stop!

41:07.715 --> 41:09.046
It doesn't work like that.

41:09.133 --> 41:10.214
(gunfire, glass shatters)

41:15.431 --> 41:17.342
(gun rattles)

41:17.433 --> 41:19.390
(exhales sharply)

41:39.872 --> 41:42.239
(chuckles)

41:47.463 --> 41:50.080
Well, shit. We coulda used those.

41:50.174 --> 41:53.007
Solar panels?

41:53.094 --> 41:56.337
That convoy, they got away, huh?

41:56.431 --> 41:58.013
All of 'em?

41:59.392 --> 42:01.099
Kid's still gotta be here.

42:01.185 --> 42:03.096
I think he wanted to
go down with the ship.

42:03.187 --> 42:04.894
Search the place.

42:04.981 --> 42:06.813
Find him, tie him up.

42:06.899 --> 42:08.105
Don't kill him.

42:08.192 --> 42:11.401
Blow up every other house.

42:11.487 --> 42:14.229
I'm gonna go to Rick's,
make a little spaghetti.

42:14.323 --> 42:17.566
When he shows up, send him my way.

42:44.062 --> 42:45.723
Norris: On the ground, kid!

42:56.365 --> 42:58.606
- Damn it.
- D.J.: Come on!

43:20.890 --> 43:23.302
Shh.

43:29.732 --> 43:32.224
Eugene: I will acquiesce
and facilitate your wishes,

43:32.318 --> 43:34.104
regardless of the foolhardiness.

43:34.195 --> 43:36.402
However, on a personal note,
it is my sincere opinion

43:36.489 --> 43:38.571
that venturing from
the confines of this infirmary

43:38.658 --> 43:40.695
will be a fatal mistake.

43:40.785 --> 43:43.197
The doctor is more than capable
of returning on his own.

43:43.287 --> 43:46.029
You, on the other hand,
will likely succumb to illness

43:46.124 --> 43:48.786
or bodily rending en route.

43:48.876 --> 43:50.742
But I know that that's
the stratagem you're choosing,

43:50.837 --> 43:51.998
and it's a dirty game.

43:53.131 --> 43:55.668
Will one of you please tell me
what the hell is going on?

43:57.677 --> 44:00.635
Gabriel believes he's on a mission
from God to return you to Hilltop

44:00.721 --> 44:03.338
to tend to the birthing
of Maggie and Glenn's child.

44:05.601 --> 44:07.467
Look, he-- he can't go anywhere.

44:07.562 --> 44:10.554
That is a conversation
the two of you need to have sotto, solo.

44:10.648 --> 44:12.685
I'm just here to inform you

44:12.775 --> 44:15.733
that the guard
at the Northside gate is 00C.

44:15.820 --> 44:17.777
What you choose to do or not do
with that knowledge

44:17.864 --> 44:19.525
is none of my beeswax or card stacks.

44:19.615 --> 44:22.403
Wait. You killed a guard?

44:22.493 --> 44:23.983
No.

44:24.078 --> 44:26.661
His coffee was compromised.

44:26.747 --> 44:28.658
He's currently riding a porcelain bus

44:28.749 --> 44:30.990
with laxative and melted
sugar-free-gum-induced diarrhea.

44:31.085 --> 44:33.201
- What?
- In fact, unless he was fleet of foot,

44:33.296 --> 44:36.755
he may very well be catastrophically
crapping his khakis right now.

44:39.177 --> 44:40.542
Why?

44:47.143 --> 44:48.929
Just, uh...

44:50.521 --> 44:53.013
plan on sleeping tonight.

44:54.025 --> 44:55.891
So come with us.

44:55.985 --> 44:59.103
It's not too late. They'll take you back.

45:04.952 --> 45:06.909
I shan't be doin' that.

45:08.873 --> 45:10.455
(keys rattle, thud)

45:10.541 --> 45:11.872
Oops.

45:11.959 --> 45:13.791
I seem to have dropped
the keys to a vehicle

45:13.878 --> 45:16.916
located just outside
the aforementioned Northside gate.

45:18.549 --> 45:20.711
You're doing the right thing.

45:20.801 --> 45:23.213
As previously debated,
that assessment is relative.

45:23.304 --> 45:24.385
No.

45:24.472 --> 45:26.338
It isn't.

46:07.682 --> 46:09.719
What're you lookin' at me for?! Go!

46:15.564 --> 46:16.645
(vehicle approaching)

46:20.111 --> 46:21.693
(brakes squeal)

46:31.580 --> 46:33.537
That's Ezekiel! We need him alive.

46:33.624 --> 46:35.786
Goddamn king's worth more
than all of 'em.

46:35.876 --> 46:37.082
Go!

46:41.924 --> 46:44.211
Nabila! Where's Ezekiel?

46:44.302 --> 46:46.043
He's still in there-- I think.

46:46.137 --> 46:47.798
I don't know.

46:47.888 --> 46:49.504
You've got to get everyone to safety.

46:49.598 --> 46:51.339
Take Cookman Parkway to Kingsley,

46:51.434 --> 46:52.640
beige house, two miles down.

46:52.727 --> 46:54.968
It's got a fence. I'll meet you there.

47:01.027 --> 47:02.563
Your Majesty.

47:03.821 --> 47:05.232
Save 'em...

47:05.323 --> 47:06.438
like you saved me.

47:06.532 --> 47:09.615
Wait. Ezekiel, no!

47:47.865 --> 47:50.698
Margaret, I-- I understand
you putting me in here,

47:50.785 --> 47:53.493
a-a-and message received, but...

47:53.579 --> 47:55.946
- you know I don't belong in here.
- Shut up.

47:56.040 --> 47:58.122
Kal: What happened out there?

47:59.001 --> 48:00.366
That one.

48:00.461 --> 48:02.043
Get him out.

48:03.214 --> 48:05.000
He gets out?

48:05.091 --> 48:06.502
(scoffs)

48:09.011 --> 48:10.547
(gate opens)

48:10.638 --> 48:12.379
Jesus:
Maggie, what are you doing?

48:12.473 --> 48:14.134
Kal, I need your gun.

48:28.864 --> 48:30.605
This one tried to kill you.

48:42.586 --> 48:43.792
Alden:
Maggie, you don't wanna do this.

48:43.879 --> 48:45.540
Shut up, Al!

48:45.631 --> 48:48.373
If cupcake wants to put on a show,
let her put on a show.

48:51.387 --> 48:53.503
You wanna be next?

48:55.433 --> 48:56.844
No, I don't.

49:04.066 --> 49:06.433
Saviors killed one of our own
tonight on the road.

49:07.862 --> 49:09.603
We aren't even, but that was a start.

49:09.697 --> 49:11.779
Jesus: Maggie.

49:11.866 --> 49:13.903
Get more guards on duty.

49:13.993 --> 49:16.485
Start fortifying the walls and bury Neil.

49:16.579 --> 49:18.570
First light, everybody else
starts tending crops.

49:18.664 --> 49:21.782
- I thought we don't give up.
- No, we don't.

49:21.876 --> 49:23.787
Simon said the others are under attack,

49:23.878 --> 49:25.585
which means there's
no more supplies going in,

49:25.671 --> 49:26.832
but there might be people.

49:26.922 --> 49:28.788
We have to be ready.

49:28.883 --> 49:31.341
It'll be up to Hilltop
to make the last stand.

50:09.381 --> 50:10.963
It's over!

50:23.646 --> 50:26.855
I made sure you guys
could get out the back.

50:28.609 --> 50:32.147
I drove the convoy
right up to the roadblock.

50:32.238 --> 50:34.149
I knew what it was.

50:39.453 --> 50:42.366
I can't go back.

50:42.456 --> 50:44.367
One of 'em got away.

50:44.458 --> 50:47.200
She's gonna tell them.

50:47.294 --> 50:49.285
How'd they get out?

50:50.464 --> 50:52.671
Was it what I did?

50:58.013 --> 51:00.095
Eugene.

51:03.102 --> 51:05.184
I can still help you.

51:05.271 --> 51:08.684
I know how they work, how Negan thinks.

51:10.025 --> 51:11.515
I want you to win.

51:11.610 --> 51:14.352
I want Negan to die.

51:16.198 --> 51:17.984
And we can settle up after.

51:33.632 --> 51:36.044
We need to get back-- now.

52:27.686 --> 52:29.643
Leave it where they'll find it.

52:29.730 --> 52:32.973
Gavin: We had a good thing going.

52:33.067 --> 52:35.809
I felt bad about the kid, too.

52:35.903 --> 52:38.486
I didn't want that. You know that!

52:40.574 --> 52:44.112
And now a lot more people have to die.

52:46.705 --> 52:48.992
Sometimes you just have to swallow it!

52:51.627 --> 52:53.209
I do.

52:55.464 --> 52:58.673
Jesus, I thought you knew that, too.

53:01.762 --> 53:04.504
I liked you, Ezekiel.

53:04.598 --> 53:08.387
Your people are gonna look up
at the Sanctuary fence,

53:08.477 --> 53:11.344
and they're gonna see their king...

53:11.438 --> 53:13.054
is dead.

53:17.277 --> 53:18.733
Keep loading the trucks.

53:18.821 --> 53:21.654
His Highness tries anything,
break his arms.

53:22.616 --> 53:24.402
Tired of playin' bean bag.

53:34.545 --> 53:36.411
(water splashes)

53:36.505 --> 53:38.587
(explosions in distance)

54:05.159 --> 54:07.617
I'm sorry.

54:07.703 --> 54:09.785
I am.

54:17.087 --> 54:20.125
(walkers growling)

54:20.215 --> 54:22.001
Rosita: Michonne.

54:23.218 --> 54:24.629
Michonne.

54:31.059 --> 54:32.470
Michonne!

54:33.395 --> 54:36.103
(manhole cover closes)

54:49.870 --> 54:51.861
(explosions in distance)

55:07.012 --> 55:08.923
(whispers) Carl.

55:10.724 --> 55:12.055
Judith.

55:14.895 --> 55:16.306
Michonne.

55:23.904 --> 55:26.817
Negan: This shit isn't funny anymore.

55:26.907 --> 55:28.989
(yells, gasps)

55:30.410 --> 55:33.198
Don't make me do this now, Rick.

55:33.288 --> 55:35.245
I got plans for you.

55:35.332 --> 55:36.822
Cut you up in little bitty pieces,

55:36.917 --> 55:39.079
feed you to the dead,
and make you watch.

55:42.005 --> 55:43.666
Then, when you're some sort of

55:43.757 --> 55:45.794
screwed-up,
creepy stump with a head...

55:48.220 --> 55:49.585
...that's when I'm gonna kill you--

55:49.680 --> 55:51.011
in front of everybody.

55:51.098 --> 55:54.011
- You ever shut the hell up?
- Nope!

55:56.103 --> 55:58.435
(chuckles)

56:00.023 --> 56:03.015
You know your kid volunteered to die?

56:04.194 --> 56:05.605
What kind of boy you raise, Rick?

56:06.572 --> 56:08.028
I'm gonna fix him.

56:08.115 --> 56:09.947
'Cause I like him.

56:10.033 --> 56:11.774
A few years,

56:11.869 --> 56:13.280
he's gonna be one of my top guys!

56:21.962 --> 56:23.452
When I am done with you,

56:23.547 --> 56:26.255
nobody will ever try to do what you did--

56:26.341 --> 56:27.797
not ever again!

56:27.885 --> 56:30.798
Not your friends, not your son--

56:35.058 --> 56:36.389
Don't you touch her!

56:55.871 --> 56:57.953
Shit.

56:58.040 --> 57:00.031
(walker growling)

57:21.647 --> 57:23.888
They're all dead.

57:23.982 --> 57:25.848
And you missed it-- all of you.

57:25.943 --> 57:27.433
This is your fault.

57:27.527 --> 57:29.393
(screams)

57:41.750 --> 57:43.491
(grunting)

57:45.212 --> 57:46.577
Michonne!

57:46.672 --> 57:48.834
(breathing heavily)

57:51.760 --> 57:53.797
H9)!-

57:53.887 --> 57:56.879
Where are they?

57:56.974 --> 57:59.636
(groans)

57:59.726 --> 58:02.935
Oh... God.

01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:28.530
Carl: I brought him here.

01:00:46.434 --> 01:00:48.846
That's how it happened.

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:07.111
(shuddered breathing)

01:02:09.976 --> 01:02:11.967
(theme music playing)
