with you, Ms. Wells.

29:37.240 --> 29:42.720

that will satisfy everyone.

29:42.720 --> 29:44.720

29:44.720 --> 29:47.160

29:47.160 --> 29:50.320

don't let them.

of the same demon.

30:48.880 --> 30:50.760
Lydia Quigley.

30:50.760 --> 30:53.720
Her interest in your
family is unnatural.

30:53.720 --> 30:56.720
We must join
forces against her.

31:00.560 --> 31:03.520
You've preached hatred
on my doorstep for weeks.

31:05.080 --> 31:08.000

31:08.000 --> 31:09.760

your evil in his ears

31:09.760 --> 31:12.040

help for my sake,

31:17.160 --> 31:19.160

31:19.160 --> 31:22.400
Quigley intends
some foulness against her.

31:22.400 --> 31:24.680
Help me, Mrs. Wells.

31:24.680 --> 31:27.640

31:27.640 --> 31:31.320
if I have claimed
otherwise in the past,

31:31.320 --> 31:32.480
it was a lie.

concerns than Lydia Quigley.

31:44.920 --> 31:47.560
I am praying for Charlotte.

31:58.480 --> 32:01.440
Had we met yesterday
I might have congratulated you

32:01.440 --> 32:06.240
on bedding the magnificent
Charlotte Wells for free.

32:06.240 --> 32:08.880
I assume you have bedded her.

32:08.880 --> 32:10.720
Alas, today, we realize

32:10.720 --> 32:13.720
what a high price
you'll pay for her.

32:13.720 --> 32:15.560
I have committed no crime.

32:15.560 --> 32:17.480
Tell me, did she
actually use you

32:17.480 --> 32:19.000
as her instrument of murder

32:19.000 --> 32:22.320
or seek you out
once the crime was done?

32:24.880 --> 32:26.920
Either way, she's used you

32:26.920 --> 32:31.720
like the witless mick you are.

32:31.720 --> 32:35.200
She is innocent and so am I.

32:35.200 --> 32:38.520
No jury'll hang either of us.

32:38.520 --> 32:40.080
You're half right.

32:40.080 --> 32:41.680
