00:55.181 --> 00:57.221
Hey, you guys,
you can't play in there. Jack.

00:57.224 --> 00:58.934
It's dangerous.
There's nails and stuff!

00:59.101 --> 01:01.187
Should've dumped them
all off at Chuck E. Cheese.

01:01.353 --> 01:03.564
That place
is a nightmare.

01:04.857 --> 01:06.859
I hate clowns.

01:07.026 --> 01:08.746
Yeah, well, it's what
he wanted. He's seven.

01:08.903 --> 01:10.946
When I was seven,
I thought clowns were creepy.

01:11.113 --> 01:13.657
Well, you can tell that to
the clown when he gets here.

01:13.824 --> 01:15.910
OK. You need a drink.

01:16.077 --> 01:17.787
- No, I can't.
- Why not?

01:19.080 --> 01:20.873
Meg?

01:22.041 --> 01:23.876
You're not?

01:24.043 --> 01:26.045
Oh, my God.

01:26.212 --> 01:29.048
Oh, my God!

01:29.215 --> 01:31.016
You can't say
anything to Kent, OK?

01:31.175 --> 01:33.260
- It's a total surprise.
- Huh?

01:33.427 --> 01:35.262
- What surprise?
- Hey, Dad.

01:35.429 --> 01:37.473
He is... he is coming, isn't he?

01:37.640 --> 01:39.600
Yes. He's just
running a little late.

01:39.767 --> 01:42.978
Just checking. Denise,
pour me a beer, will you?

01:43.145 --> 01:46.065
Hello.

01:49.568 --> 01:51.529
You're kidding.

01:53.030 --> 01:56.992
Well... Is there
somebody else you could send?

01:57.159 --> 01:59.161
Yes, sir.

01:59.328 --> 02:01.497
Oh, no, it's no problem at all.

02:01.664 --> 02:04.583
Oh, it's my pleasure. OK. 'Bye.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.836
Ooh!

02:11.632 --> 02:13.801
OK, I'm coming,
I'm coming, I'm coming.

02:15.010 --> 02:18.055
Hey, honey.
I'm headed out the door.

02:18.222 --> 02:20.975
- Is Jack excited?
- Yeah. Listen.

02:21.142 --> 02:23.018
The Party Emporium
people screwed up

02:23.185 --> 02:25.771
and... there's no clown coming.

02:25.938 --> 02:27.648
I thought you had a backup.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.817
Who double-books a clown?

02:29.984 --> 02:31.902
Listen. Just hurry up
and get home, OK, babe?

02:33.320 --> 02:35.489
- Kent?
- OK, listen.

02:35.656 --> 02:38.784
It's... Everything's gonna be fine.
I'll be home soon.

02:41.036 --> 02:42.746
Hello?

02:53.507 --> 02:55.843
Hey, everybody!

03:11.650 --> 03:14.987
Ohh!

03:16.030 --> 03:20.034
Where's Daddy?
He's gonna miss the clown.

03:22.203 --> 03:23.621
Listen.

03:23.787 --> 03:25.789
Oh...

03:25.956 --> 03:28.356
It seems like there was
a little bit of a kerfuffle, alright?

03:28.459 --> 03:29.835
Ladies and gentlemen!

03:30.002 --> 03:31.603
- May I have your attention?
- He's here!

03:31.670 --> 03:33.339
Please gather around,
one and all,

03:33.505 --> 03:38.802
for the wacky, the wonderful,
Dummo the Clown!

03:41.764 --> 03:44.642
Let's get
this party started, huh?

03:47.603 --> 03:49.355
Where's the number one
birthday boy?

03:49.521 --> 03:51.273
Well, give it up for Jack!

03:51.440 --> 03:54.360
Let's make this
the best birthday ever!

04:16.714 --> 04:19.760
OK, Jack.
I've gotta go back to the circus.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.720
Time for bed.

04:21.887 --> 04:25.933
Mmm... I know it's you, Dad.

04:26.100 --> 04:30.104
No. My name is Dummo.

04:31.272 --> 04:34.775
I hear your dad's
a pretty great guy, though.

04:37.027 --> 04:39.738
Go, go, go, go.

04:48.872 --> 04:52.418
Oh, God. I forgot I was a clown.

04:54.586 --> 04:58.757
You were perfect. Jack loved it.

04:59.800 --> 05:03.095
- Where did you find this thing?
- Ahh...

05:09.476 --> 05:11.353
Where's the zipper?

05:11.520 --> 05:13.522
Slipped right on.

05:14.565 --> 05:16.650
- I have big news for you.
- Oh, yeah?

05:16.817 --> 05:18.944
- Mm-hm.
- Didn't know it was MY birthday.

05:22.948 --> 05:24.908
Ohh...

05:25.075 --> 05:26.535
I...

05:26.702 --> 05:28.162
Mm.

05:28.329 --> 05:29.955
What?

05:30.122 --> 05:32.291
This might be
just a little too weird.

05:32.458 --> 05:38.255
Come on. Make a little...
make a little clown baby, huh?

05:38.422 --> 05:41.175
Yeah... You watch TV.

05:41.342 --> 05:43.177
I'm gonna go take
a shower first.

05:43.344 --> 05:45.054
Don't...

05:45.220 --> 05:47.348
You take that thing off,
I'll give you your present.

06:19.088 --> 06:20.964
Shh!

06:31.266 --> 06:33.143
Kent!

06:35.187 --> 06:37.856
Better not be clown marks
on the couch, sweetie.

06:38.023 --> 06:40.442
Yeah, still a clown!

06:40.609 --> 06:43.362
What time is it?
I think this wig is stuck.

06:43.529 --> 06:45.249
Yeah, you shouldn't
have slept in it, maybe.

06:45.406 --> 06:47.950
Hey, guess what.
The clown is driving you to school today.

06:48.117 --> 06:49.827
- Cool!
- Yeah, cool.

06:49.993 --> 06:52.393
- No, wait. Honey, I have...
- Hurry. Jack's late for school.

06:52.413 --> 06:54.498
I have a crew waiting.
I have to get changed...

06:54.665 --> 06:56.291
'Bye. Love you.

06:56.458 --> 06:58.335
Love you!

06:59.378 --> 07:01.046
Hurry up and eat. Come on.

07:09.054 --> 07:10.806
Dad, hurry!
I'm gonna be late!

07:10.973 --> 07:12.850
Coming!

07:14.226 --> 07:15.853
Ugh...

07:23.402 --> 07:25.612
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.282
Jack, your lunch!

07:29.366 --> 07:32.035
Jack! Your lunch!

07:35.873 --> 07:37.958
Thanks, Dummo.

07:42.004 --> 07:44.339
Great.

07:45.757 --> 07:47.593
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.

07:47.759 --> 07:50.137
It's just tearing the carpet
out on the first floor.

07:50.304 --> 07:52.639
Then we'll talk
about the hardwood.

07:54.933 --> 07:57.644
- Who are you?
- I'm Kent, the realtor.

07:57.811 --> 08:00.731
I talked to Miguel.
I'm sorry. Are you Miguel?

08:00.898 --> 08:03.901
Why are you dressed
like a clown?

08:06.028 --> 08:08.030
You guys have kids?

08:36.265 --> 08:39.019
Ohh!

08:39.186 --> 08:41.980
Arggh! Fuck!

08:42.147 --> 08:44.566
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

08:47.945 --> 08:49.655
Fu...

08:54.576 --> 08:56.411
Ohh!

09:07.798 --> 09:10.092
Oh, yes!

09:37.661 --> 09:40.956
- Can I use this?
- What are you doing in there?

09:41.123 --> 09:42.833
- Need some help?
- No, no, no, no, no.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.004
I got it. It's...
it's looking great, by the way.

09:55.554 --> 09:57.097
Ow.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.766
Oh, this...

09:59.933 --> 10:02.185
..this is a bad idea.

10:12.029 --> 10:14.156
Arggh!

11:07.876 --> 11:11.129
Oh, Dad.
What are you doing?!

11:11.296 --> 11:13.382
I wanted to surprise Jack
with the swing set.

11:13.548 --> 11:15.467
Oh, you scared the crap
out of me.

11:15.634 --> 11:17.552
Well, I wanted
to surprise you too.

11:17.719 --> 11:20.847
Dad, Kent was gonna do this.

11:21.014 --> 11:24.559
Yeah, well,
I'm just trying to help.

11:24.726 --> 11:26.436
Yeah, right. It's freezing.

11:26.603 --> 11:29.481
- Let's go inside.
- I'm making dinner.

11:29.648 --> 11:31.858
The damn instructions
are in Chinese.

11:41.243 --> 11:42.953
Hey, babe!

11:43.120 --> 11:45.414
You just missed Dad.

11:45.580 --> 11:47.416
I thought we were
having family dinner,

11:47.582 --> 11:49.292
but Jack just went down.

11:49.459 --> 11:51.700
If you wanna run upstairs
you can probably say goodnight.

11:55.924 --> 11:57.968
Shadow! Lie down.

12:02.305 --> 12:04.599
You went to work like that?

12:04.766 --> 12:07.644
You don't understand.
I can't get it off.

12:07.811 --> 12:09.563
- Why not?
- Because I can't.

12:09.730 --> 12:12.482
I broke a hand saw.
I cut my wrist open.

12:12.649 --> 12:15.944
And I really... I really,
really have to pee.

12:16.111 --> 12:18.363
OK. OK, OK.
Kent, just calm down.

12:18.530 --> 12:21.783
Sweetheart,
I physically cannot get it off.

12:21.950 --> 12:23.702
I've been trying all day.

12:23.869 --> 12:25.996
OK, so... so it's... it's stuck.

12:26.163 --> 12:28.623
It's suffocating me.
I'm serious! This is...

12:28.790 --> 12:30.876
- Alright.
- Ow. Ow.

12:31.042 --> 12:33.002
It's not... It doesn't...
It's not gonna come off.

12:33.128 --> 12:35.714
Why are you laughing at me?

12:35.881 --> 12:39.593
So dumb. Now I know
why they call you Dummo.

12:44.222 --> 12:46.975
Alright. Here we go.

12:51.605 --> 12:55.650
Relax, OK? This is what I do.

12:56.693 --> 12:58.862
And if you're really good,
I'll get you a lollipop.

12:59.029 --> 13:01.114
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.492
- One.
- Ow, ow.

13:03.658 --> 13:05.285
- Two.
- Ow!

13:05.452 --> 13:07.537
OK, OK. OK.

13:13.919 --> 13:15.587
Alright.

13:17.923 --> 13:19.633
Alright, I'm just gonna do this.

13:19.800 --> 13:23.512
- Are you serious?
- Like a bandaid, OK?

13:23.678 --> 13:26.681
- One.
- Oh! Ohh...

13:26.848 --> 13:29.267
- Two.
- Ooh! Ooh!

13:31.228 --> 13:33.980
Three! Three!

13:34.147 --> 13:36.441
- Oh!
- Shadow! Bad dog!

13:36.608 --> 13:40.403
Ohh! Ohh!

13:40.570 --> 13:42.656
Sweetie, what did you
do to yourself?

13:42.823 --> 13:47.118
Ohh!

13:48.537 --> 13:51.790
- Did you dye your hair?
- It's a wig.

13:51.957 --> 13:53.667
No, it's not.

13:53.834 --> 13:57.045
Sweetie, did you
dye and perm your hair?

13:57.212 --> 13:58.922
I didn't dye my hair!
What the f...

13:59.089 --> 14:01.132
- Daddy?
- Oh, Jack.

14:01.299 --> 14:03.343
Sweetie, let's get you to bed,
alright, honey?

14:03.510 --> 14:05.512
What's Shadow eating?

14:05.679 --> 14:07.514
Daddy's OK.

14:07.681 --> 14:09.474
Ohh...

14:20.277 --> 14:22.529
You're just gonna have to
let the adhesive dissolve.

14:22.696 --> 14:25.365
You definitely don't want
to take any more skin off.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.242
Just take some warm showers.

14:27.409 --> 14:30.328
There wasn't any adhesive.
I'm not an idiot.

14:31.371 --> 14:34.165
Maybe someone's
playing a prank on you.

14:34.332 --> 14:36.459
Who would do that?

14:37.502 --> 14:39.754
What happened to your wrist?

14:39.921 --> 14:43.091
Oh, I, uh... I cut myself.

14:43.258 --> 14:45.051
By accident.

14:46.094 --> 14:47.971
Mr McCoy, if you need
to speak with someone,

14:48.138 --> 14:50.098
we have counsellors
that can help you.

14:50.265 --> 14:53.435
Funny. No.
You don't understand.

14:53.602 --> 14:56.813
There is something going on.
This was a wig.

14:56.980 --> 15:01.484
And the white make-up,
uh... It...

15:01.651 --> 15:03.570
What kind of make-up
do you usually use?

15:03.737 --> 15:05.780
I'm not a clown!

15:49.199 --> 15:51.159
Come on, Jack. Brush your teeth!

16:00.085 --> 16:04.089
Hey, Olive. It's Kent.
Can you do me a favour?

16:04.255 --> 16:05.966
Can you check the property files

16:06.132 --> 16:09.344
to see if the Oakdale place
lists the previous owner's name?

16:09.511 --> 16:12.847
I think the initials are KC.

16:13.014 --> 16:14.933
Uh, OK. Hold...

16:15.100 --> 16:18.019
Let me... Give me a sec.
Let me see if I can find...

16:22.607 --> 16:26.111
You know what?
I'll... I'll come in and get it.

16:49.467 --> 16:52.345
Ohh...

16:52.512 --> 16:54.431
- Hey, Olive.
- Hey, Kent.

17:01.563 --> 17:03.982
Oh...

17:04.148 --> 17:05.775
Oh!

17:05.942 --> 17:10.530
Sorry! Oh...

17:19.705 --> 17:22.416
Sonofabitch.

17:29.758 --> 17:31.968
Still hungry?

17:33.720 --> 17:35.346
Eugh, gross.

17:35.513 --> 17:38.641
I don't know. It looks old.
It smells weird.

17:38.808 --> 17:41.936
- Come on. Anything else? Please.
- I don't know, man.

17:42.103 --> 17:46.107
We sell Halloween costumes
and cheap stuff, not like that.

17:46.274 --> 17:47.984
OK, but who does?

17:48.151 --> 17:51.780
There's, like, a lot.
They're in here.

17:57.327 --> 17:59.120
That one.

18:19.307 --> 18:21.017
Yeah.

18:21.184 --> 18:23.561
I'm calling about
a clown costume

18:23.728 --> 18:25.438
I think might belong to you.

18:25.605 --> 18:28.149
It was found in
Martin Karlsson's basement.

18:28.316 --> 18:29.984
Where's Marty?

18:30.151 --> 18:33.863
Oh. Uh, I'm sorry. Uh...

18:34.030 --> 18:35.907
Martin Karlsson passed away.

18:36.074 --> 18:37.867
I'm the real estate agent
handling the...

18:38.034 --> 18:42.163
Listen to me. Whatever
you do, don't touch that costume.

18:42.330 --> 18:45.500
You understand?
Stay away from it.

18:45.667 --> 18:47.502
Are you still at the house?

18:47.669 --> 18:50.004
I'll be over as soon as I can.

18:50.171 --> 18:54.092
But don't touch
the costume, please.

18:55.135 --> 18:57.387
I'm wearing it.

18:57.554 --> 18:59.222
Hello?

18:59.389 --> 19:01.933
Uh, that's fine.

19:02.100 --> 19:04.686
Uh, be careful.
It's old and fragile.

19:04.853 --> 19:06.479
It doesn't seem very fragile.

19:06.646 --> 19:09.274
I'm actually having
a pretty hard time getting it off.

19:09.440 --> 19:11.651
Don't worry.
That happens all the time.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.528
The heat from your body

19:13.695 --> 19:15.947
can constrict the moisture
trapped in those old fibres.

19:16.114 --> 19:18.700
Makes it hard to get off.

19:18.867 --> 19:21.703
Oh, that... that... that
makes perfect sense.

19:21.870 --> 19:25.748
I thought I...
..I thought I was going crazy.

19:25.915 --> 19:28.168
We should meet
as soon as possible.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.295
Can you come to my warehouse?

19:30.461 --> 19:34.382
Uh... Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
I can get there.

19:34.549 --> 19:37.385
We'll have
that thing off in no time.

20:12.754 --> 20:15.048
Hello?

20:27.352 --> 20:28.394
Hello?

20:33.858 --> 20:36.110
Is anyone here?

21:03.721 --> 21:06.057
- Kent.
- Jesus Christ!

21:06.224 --> 21:09.352
- Oh!
- I didn't want to scare you.

21:09.519 --> 21:12.063
- I'm Bert Karlsson.
- Nice to meet you.

21:12.230 --> 21:14.023
Tea?

21:14.190 --> 21:15.316
Uh...

21:17.193 --> 21:19.195
Mm! Thank you.

21:19.362 --> 21:23.950
I've been abroad off and on
these last couple of years.

21:24.117 --> 21:26.703
I haven't talked to Marty
for ages.

21:28.997 --> 21:32.750
Our relationship was, yeah,
complicated.

21:33.793 --> 21:36.379
I'm sorry I never met him.

21:37.422 --> 21:40.967
That is a very old...
traditional costume

21:41.134 --> 21:42.719
from the Nordic regions.

21:42.885 --> 21:47.765
It wasn't until years later
it became a silly character.

21:47.932 --> 21:52.228
The original clown,
he was not funny at all.

21:54.522 --> 21:57.400
So, tell me, Mr Karlsson,

21:57.567 --> 22:01.195
how are we gonna get
this thing off of me?

22:01.362 --> 22:04.741
Very few people know
the true origin

22:04.907 --> 22:07.744
of what we call the clown.

22:07.910 --> 22:09.829
I can show you here.

22:12.248 --> 22:14.250
There.

22:16.502 --> 22:19.047
It lived up in the mountains,

22:19.213 --> 22:23.676
with a skin white as snow
and the red nose,

22:23.843 --> 22:25.762
blistered by the cold.

22:28.097 --> 22:32.018
It lured children out
of the villages into its cave.

22:32.185 --> 22:35.563
Five children.

22:35.730 --> 22:40.818
One child
for every month of winter.

22:43.237 --> 22:46.491
Over the centuries, the legend
of the cloyne was forgotten.

22:46.657 --> 22:50.620
He became the clown.

22:51.662 --> 22:55.333
His white face and red nose,
to make people laugh.

22:55.500 --> 22:58.920
To entertain children.

22:59.087 --> 23:03.424
If only they knew!

23:10.848 --> 23:13.851
Why are you showing me this?

23:20.775 --> 23:22.735
So you can understand.

23:50.680 --> 23:52.849
Ugh!

23:54.434 --> 23:56.269
Ugh!

23:56.436 --> 23:59.147
Oh, shit!

24:03.651 --> 24:05.653
- Ugh!
- Oh, no.

24:05.820 --> 24:08.114
The tea was supposed
to keep you asleep for hours.

24:08.281 --> 24:10.241
Ugh!

24:10.408 --> 24:13.286
I'd go get some more,
but I can't risk you getting loose.

24:13.453 --> 24:15.872
Oh! Wha... Wha...

24:16.038 --> 24:18.499
It's gonna be alright.

24:18.666 --> 24:20.126
Wha...

24:20.293 --> 24:24.964
Decapitation is the only way
to stop the demon.

24:25.131 --> 24:27.633
No, wait.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.927
Wait. Wait.

24:30.094 --> 24:31.262
Wait.

24:31.429 --> 24:34.724
- Ugh! Ugh!
- I'm sorry.

24:34.891 --> 24:36.934
Ugh! Ugh!

24:37.101 --> 24:39.270
Ugh!

24:39.437 --> 24:42.064
- Ugh!
- I'm so sorry.

24:42.231 --> 24:43.691
Ah! Ah!

24:45.610 --> 24:47.069
Ah!

24:47.236 --> 24:49.530
What the fuck?!

24:49.697 --> 24:52.992
I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

25:05.880 --> 25:08.216
What the fuck are you doing?!

25:09.967 --> 25:12.220
It's not a costume.

25:12.386 --> 25:14.972
It's skin. And hair.

25:15.139 --> 25:16.641
Of a demon.

25:29.904 --> 25:33.741
- Honey! Call 911!
- What? Where have you been?!

25:33.908 --> 25:35.660
This maniac tried to kill me.

25:35.826 --> 25:38.371
The guy whose house it was
that had the suit in it.

25:38.538 --> 25:39.914
Look. He thinks I'm a demon.

25:40.081 --> 25:42.625
Honey, we have to
go to the cops.

25:42.792 --> 25:45.962
But you have to come with me,
'cause they're gonna think I'm crazy

25:46.128 --> 25:47.630
if I'm dressed like a... clown.

25:47.797 --> 25:49.715
What the fuck?!

25:49.882 --> 25:51.801
Are you wearing make-up?

25:51.968 --> 25:55.388
Let go of her, Kent!
What the hell is wrong with you?

25:55.555 --> 25:58.975
Walt, I know this seems
a little crazy, a little nuts,

25:59.141 --> 26:00.768
but this guy's a maniac.

26:00.935 --> 26:02.645
If this is a joke,
it's not very funny.

26:02.812 --> 26:05.398
- It's not a joke!
- So take off the clown suit.

26:05.565 --> 26:07.358
I can't!
You think I'm making this up?

26:07.525 --> 26:09.569
He chopped my neck
with a butcher knife!

26:09.735 --> 26:12.697
- Is this blood?
- Yes, it's my blood!

26:12.863 --> 26:14.740
He chopped me
with a butcher knife!

26:14.907 --> 26:16.576
Who did?

26:23.958 --> 26:26.085
Who the hell is that?

26:26.252 --> 26:28.546
He tried to cut off my head.

26:29.589 --> 26:33.634
He thinks I'm...
I'm turning into a demon.

26:35.052 --> 26:36.971
Baby, he... he's crazy.

26:37.138 --> 26:39.724
This is his suit. He did this.
All of it.

26:39.890 --> 26:42.351
Just take the fucking thing off!

26:44.353 --> 26:47.773
- Arggh!
- Oh, Jesus, Dave!

26:47.940 --> 26:50.860
Are you fucking
out of your head?

26:51.027 --> 26:53.738
Baby...

26:53.904 --> 26:55.906
Meet me at the police station.

26:56.949 --> 26:58.034
Please.

27:11.797 --> 27:13.674
You're going to jail, man.

27:13.841 --> 27:16.093
You are going to jail.

27:19.555 --> 27:21.474
I'm trying to help you.

27:28.689 --> 27:30.358
Oh! Oh!

27:42.161 --> 27:44.330
It's... happening.

28:35.548 --> 28:37.383
What are you doing to me?!

28:41.345 --> 28:44.098
Kill... yourself...

28:45.599 --> 28:48.436
..before...

29:01.782 --> 29:04.702
Hey, man. You OK? You OK, man?

29:16.338 --> 29:18.674
Kill yourself.

29:20.843 --> 29:22.762
Kill yourself.

29:47.495 --> 29:50.414
- Ms McCoy?
- I'm sorry, what?

29:50.581 --> 29:52.875
Right, one last question.

29:53.042 --> 29:56.337
Do you remember what he was wearing
the last time you saw him?

29:57.713 --> 29:59.882
Like a...

30:01.509 --> 30:04.887
..a long coat and a... dark hat.

30:07.097 --> 30:08.349
OK.

30:10.267 --> 30:12.812
If you hear something, you call.

30:14.146 --> 30:16.148
Thank you.

30:19.193 --> 30:21.070
Maybe it's a chemical thing.

30:22.488 --> 30:23.864
You know.

30:24.031 --> 30:26.075
He seems like Mr Perfect Dad,

30:26.242 --> 30:28.536
but then, suddenly...

30:31.872 --> 30:35.042
Meg, I want you and Jack to
come stay with me for a while.

30:35.209 --> 30:37.253
You got to
think of your family, Meg.

30:37.419 --> 30:39.129
You can't baby him.

30:39.296 --> 30:43.634
You got to tell Jack
his dad's dangerous.

30:43.801 --> 30:45.594
I don't have to
listen to this anymore.

30:45.761 --> 30:47.322
I'm just trying to
make it clear that...

30:47.471 --> 30:49.014
Dad.

30:49.181 --> 30:50.933
He was scared.

31:02.862 --> 31:06.490
Mom... Is this my fault?

31:06.657 --> 31:09.994
No! It's not your fault.
It's no-one's fault.

31:10.160 --> 31:11.871
Just get some sleep.

31:14.164 --> 31:15.749
Goodnight, doll.

31:49.783 --> 31:52.328
Pipe down, fellas. Let's go.

32:11.764 --> 32:14.266
Hey. You left your dirty plate
by the fire.

32:14.433 --> 32:16.560
- Go clean it up.
- Oh, crud.

32:18.562 --> 32:20.481
Don't get lost, lard-ass.

32:20.648 --> 32:22.274
Zip it, Dickinson!

32:50.302 --> 32:51.929
Do you have any food?

32:56.308 --> 32:58.686
All I want is some food.

33:02.731 --> 33:04.817
I've got these.

33:40.894 --> 33:43.689
..should pick him up
are me or my neighbour Denise.

33:43.856 --> 33:46.525
So you got my cell phone.
And my dad's first name's Walt.

33:46.692 --> 33:49.069
So... Try him too.

33:49.236 --> 33:51.321
Thanks. Appreciate it.

33:54.950 --> 33:57.077
Oh, hey, sweetie. Come here.

33:57.244 --> 33:59.121
I'm gonna go, OK?

33:59.288 --> 34:01.081
But who's gonna
pick you up today?

34:01.248 --> 34:03.375
- You or Denise.
- Mm-hm.

34:03.542 --> 34:05.252
And if you see Daddy?

34:05.419 --> 34:07.254
Is Daddy bad?

34:07.421 --> 34:09.757
No. No, no, no, no, no.

34:09.922 --> 34:13.177
He just... He has to do
some grown-up stuff today, OK?

34:13.342 --> 34:15.094
But if he comes to pick you up?

34:15.262 --> 34:18.431
Say that the teacher
wants to talk to him

34:18.599 --> 34:20.641
and that he should call Mommy.

34:20.809 --> 34:21.810
And...

34:21.976 --> 34:23.562
And that's it.

34:23.728 --> 34:25.355
Mm-hm.

34:25.522 --> 34:27.733
Daddy's coming home soon, OK?

34:28.775 --> 34:31.737
Mwah. 'Bye, doll.

34:34.239 --> 34:35.991
'Bye, doll!

35:11.610 --> 35:13.695
Hey, honey, it's me. It's your dad.

35:13.862 --> 35:17.449
I'm calling to make sure
everything's OK.

35:18.742 --> 35:20.452
See if you heard anything.

35:20.619 --> 35:22.246
Please give me a call and...

35:22.412 --> 35:24.289
Give me a call, OK?

36:05.998 --> 36:08.208
Alright, people.
10 minutes, we're leaving.

36:26.185 --> 36:29.479
- Oh, it stinks in here.
- Oh, gross. What is that?

36:29.646 --> 36:31.148
Hello?

36:33.150 --> 36:35.194
There anybody in there?

36:35.360 --> 36:37.029
Door's locked.

36:37.196 --> 36:39.656
Hello?

36:44.620 --> 36:47.789
Hello?

36:55.297 --> 36:58.550
Ugh!

36:58.717 --> 37:00.219
Kids, kids!

37:00.385 --> 37:02.596
Just stay away from me!

37:45.138 --> 37:47.099
Are you a clown?

37:48.892 --> 37:52.145
My name's Robbie.
What's your name?

37:54.189 --> 37:56.566
Whoa! You're really hungry.

37:57.651 --> 38:02.572
If you wanna eat, I got some
Cookie Crisps and waffles

38:02.739 --> 38:06.326
and Cinnamon Toast Crunch
and chocolate chips

38:06.493 --> 38:10.539
and chips and some jelly beans
and some beef jerky...

38:10.706 --> 38:12.666
..and some cookies...

38:12.833 --> 38:16.503
..cheese and fries
and ketchup and...

38:16.670 --> 38:18.213
Stay away.

39:11.308 --> 39:13.560
Hi. Want some cereal?

39:19.441 --> 39:20.942
Mr Clown?

39:24.905 --> 39:26.281
Mr Clown?

39:29.451 --> 39:31.870
Mr Clown!

39:52.933 --> 39:54.393
He's acting crazy.

39:56.311 --> 39:58.980
Well, maybe it was
something he ate.

39:59.147 --> 40:01.191
Is it 'cause he ate
Daddy's clown nose?

40:03.443 --> 40:04.986
Jack, stay right here.

40:05.153 --> 40:07.155
- Stay here.
- Is that Daddy?

40:07.322 --> 40:10.450
Hello? Kent? What's going on?

40:11.868 --> 40:13.620
Jack really misses you.

40:13.787 --> 40:15.956
I'm so sorry.

40:16.123 --> 40:19.126
Tell me where you are.
Tell... tell me you're OK.

40:19.292 --> 40:20.961
I can't take this.

40:21.128 --> 40:22.671
I'm sorry.

40:23.713 --> 40:26.675
This... this is the only way.

40:30.679 --> 40:32.222
Hello?

40:36.977 --> 40:38.311
Mom...

40:40.021 --> 40:42.441
When is Daddy coming home?

40:44.568 --> 40:46.111
Tonight, Jack.

40:46.278 --> 40:47.654
Don't worry.

40:47.821 --> 40:50.240
Daddy's gonna be OK.

41:26.276 --> 41:28.069
Oh!

41:29.279 --> 41:31.239
Thank you.

41:31.406 --> 41:35.202
It's gonna take you all night.
Are you sure?

41:35.368 --> 41:37.787
Yeah. I'll find him.

41:38.830 --> 41:41.416
Yeah, our last big fight,
I was bawling my eyes out.

41:41.583 --> 41:43.752
Kent was hanging out
at one of his properties.

41:43.919 --> 41:47.631
- What an asshole.
- Yeah.

..I know something crazy
is happening to you, OK?

46:00.800 --> 46:02.594
I believe you.

46:04.095 --> 46:06.139
OK? I believe you.

46:08.558 --> 46:10.268
We're gonna
figure this out together.

46:11.686 --> 46:13.354
Jack needs you.

46:14.689 --> 46:18.026
I need you.

46:24.115 --> 46:25.241
Kent...

46:27.327 --> 46:29.621
..I'm pregnant.

46:57.482 --> 46:59.150
Take me home.

46:59.317 --> 47:00.527
Please.

47:28.680 --> 47:30.682
OK. It's OK.

47:30.849 --> 47:33.142
Oh...

47:41.276 --> 47:43.611
I can feel myself changing.

47:48.199 --> 47:49.826
What do you want me to do?

47:52.078 --> 47:56.457
No matter what I say,
you don't let me out.

47:57.917 --> 47:59.460
Promise me?

48:01.838 --> 48:03.381
Promise me.

48:04.716 --> 48:06.134
Promise.

48:08.720 --> 48:10.805
Until we can get you fixed.

48:12.181 --> 48:13.600
OK?

48:52.221 --> 48:54.974
Dr Martin Karlsson.

48:59.687 --> 49:02.231
Children's cancer ward.

49:23.294 --> 49:26.130
Karlsson.

49:48.486 --> 49:50.697
Do you know who I am?

49:52.991 --> 49:55.326
I just wanna talk to you.

50:09.173 --> 50:12.135
I don't know what happened
between you and my husband,

50:12.301 --> 50:14.387
but I just want him back.

50:36.034 --> 50:37.660
I don't know. He, um...

50:37.827 --> 50:39.704
The police are looking for him.

50:40.788 --> 50:42.331
No.

50:48.713 --> 50:50.256
Alright.

50:52.842 --> 50:57.972
Because the suit,
it does things to people, doesn't it?

51:07.565 --> 51:10.485
How do you get the suit off?

51:13.362 --> 51:14.864
How do you get the suit off?!

51:16.365 --> 51:18.242
How did you get it off?

51:25.583 --> 51:27.919
Who are you?

51:35.259 --> 51:38.179
If you don't wanna help me out,
I'll find another way.

51:38.346 --> 51:39.746
Ma'am, you can't be in there.

51:39.889 --> 51:43.184
I'm leaving.

51:54.070 --> 51:55.613
Hello?

52:29.397 --> 52:30.940
Hello?

54:41.570 --> 54:45.283
Awww. What's wrong, doll?
Are you crying?

54:45.449 --> 54:47.368
Shut up!

54:48.452 --> 54:50.705
You're such a little bitch.

54:50.871 --> 54:52.623
What's wrong?

54:52.790 --> 54:57.295
Don't you wanna look like a clown,
just like your fag dad?

54:59.297 --> 55:01.966
Ow! Fuck! He bit me!

56:09.700 --> 56:12.119
Mom?

56:13.245 --> 56:14.789
Mom?

56:17.166 --> 56:18.542
Jack?

56:18.709 --> 56:20.086
Hello?

56:20.252 --> 56:22.463
I'm in the basement, buddy.

56:24.382 --> 56:26.467
Daddy? Is that you?

56:26.634 --> 56:29.929
Sure is, sport.
Did you miss Daddy?

56:30.096 --> 56:34.183
Mommy said if I saw you,
I had to tell the teacher.

56:34.350 --> 56:35.893
Is she here?

56:36.060 --> 56:37.770
I don't think so.

56:37.937 --> 56:42.024
Good. Come downstairs.
I need help.

56:43.109 --> 56:45.653
Mommy says it's OK.

56:59.083 --> 57:02.378
What are you doing
down there, Daddy?

57:02.545 --> 57:04.255
Come downstairs.

57:04.422 --> 57:08.050
I wanna see
my number one birthday boy.

57:08.217 --> 57:10.761
- Hello?
Meg?
- Yeah?

57:10.928 --> 57:13.013
I was picking Jack up
at school today, right?

57:13.180 --> 57:14.932
Yeah, Denise. Thanks for that.

57:15.099 --> 57:18.644
No, I mean, I'm at the school,
and... and he's not here.

57:27.736 --> 57:29.447
Daddy?

57:29.613 --> 57:32.241
I'm stuck, Jack.

57:32.408 --> 57:34.952
I need help.

57:35.119 --> 57:38.080
Oh. Are you crying, buddy?

57:40.207 --> 57:44.128
Hey. Come on, now.

57:46.046 --> 57:49.341
You know you can
always talk to Dummo.

57:51.802 --> 57:57.475
At school, some kids tried
to put paste on my face.

57:57.641 --> 58:00.561
They're always doing that stuff.

58:00.728 --> 58:02.396
Who is?

58:03.439 --> 58:05.816
Colton.

58:05.983 --> 58:09.612
You know what I did
when I was bullied?

58:11.197 --> 58:16.660
I hid, so that
they couldn't find me.

58:17.953 --> 58:22.958
And then, after a while,
you know what happened?

58:25.085 --> 58:27.630
They left you alone?

58:33.135 --> 58:38.098
Hey, Jack. You know
where the bolt cutters are?

59:00.329 --> 59:01.872
Kent?!

59:05.960 --> 59:08.712
J... Jack?!

59:15.344 --> 59:16.720
Oh, Jack.

59:16.887 --> 59:19.765
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

59:19.932 --> 59:21.433
Why'd you leave school?!

59:21.600 --> 59:24.103
Don't ever do that to me, OK?!

59:24.270 --> 59:25.646
Jack!

59:25.813 --> 59:27.356
Where's Daddy?

59:28.482 --> 59:30.067
Where is he?

59:34.822 --> 59:36.490
Yee-ahh!

59:36.657 --> 59:38.158
Shit, dude, don't kill me.

59:38.325 --> 59:40.452
Guys?
You guys really...

59:40.619 --> 59:44.456
I just wanna tell you something.
You guys suck balls.

59:44.623 --> 59:47.459
- Yeah, your mom's balls.
- Come on, man!

59:47.626 --> 59:50.421
Duh. Look at me.
I'm Colton.

59:50.588 --> 59:52.965
- Look, a rocket launcher.
- I don't know where it is.

59:53.132 --> 59:56.260
Don't give a shit
where the rocket launcher is.

59:56.427 --> 59:58.187
- Oh, shit!
- Shit, shit, shit!

59:58.304 --> 01:00:00.097
Bitch!

01:00:00.264 --> 01:00:02.224
Don't come at me
with that rocket launcher bullshit.

01:00:02.391 --> 01:00:04.310
Yeah,
rocket launcher's cheap, dude.

01:00:04.476 --> 01:00:06.270
Rocket launchers
are for bitches, man.

01:00:06.437 --> 01:00:08.272
Shit! Guys, don't kill me.

01:00:08.439 --> 01:00:11.275
Stop bitching.
After that bullshit you just pulled?

01:00:13.819 --> 01:00:17.573
Come on, Colton. How long
does it take to change a tampon?

01:00:22.494 --> 01:00:24.580
Guys, I think
there's someone in here.

01:00:24.747 --> 01:00:27.875
Probably Master Chief.

01:00:37.885 --> 01:00:39.720
Hey, check this out.

01:00:42.598 --> 01:00:47.186
Oh, man - that reminds me
of what I did to Colton's mom last night.

01:00:47.353 --> 01:00:50.147
Mr McCoy? Is Jack here?

01:00:50.314 --> 01:00:52.107
Colton, where are you?

01:00:52.274 --> 01:00:54.360
- Bet he's in trouble.
- Why?

01:00:54.526 --> 01:00:57.279
We were ditching class
and we saw this kid Jack

01:00:57.446 --> 01:00:59.907
crying on the steps, so Colton
made him act like a clown.

01:01:00.074 --> 01:01:02.993
And he called his dad a fag.

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.079
So Colton took
this bottle of glue

01:01:05.245 --> 01:01:07.456
and was gonna rub it all over
the little douche's face.

01:01:07.623 --> 01:01:08.999
Guys, shut up!

01:01:09.166 --> 01:01:11.293
But then he grabbed
Colton's hand and bit him.

01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:12.878
Colton's gonna beat his ass...

01:01:13.045 --> 01:01:14.963
Guys, shut up!

01:01:15.130 --> 01:01:16.840
You're done, man.

01:01:24.765 --> 01:01:26.975
Grandpa's excited to see you.

01:01:32.022 --> 01:01:34.692
You don't want
your little friend anymore?

01:01:38.779 --> 01:01:41.281
Jack. Say something.

01:01:45.994 --> 01:01:48.288
Jack, come on! We gotta go!

01:01:51.166 --> 01:01:53.711
Shadow?

01:02:01.093 --> 01:02:02.803
Shadow?

01:02:02.970 --> 01:02:04.513
Shadow, what happened to your...

01:02:18.527 --> 01:02:20.446
Where is he?

01:02:22.656 --> 01:02:24.450
Oh, my God!

01:02:24.616 --> 01:02:26.285
Stay the hell away from us!

01:02:26.452 --> 01:02:27.995
Don't want to hurt you.

01:02:28.162 --> 01:02:31.165
You stay away from us!
You killed my fucking dog!

01:02:33.709 --> 01:02:35.919
Please, you've gotta help me
find your husband!

01:02:36.086 --> 01:02:38.964
- Get the fuck outta my house!
- No, you don't understand.

01:02:43.719 --> 01:02:45.345
That's the detective.

01:02:48.432 --> 01:02:52.770
I'm the only one
who can get that costume off.

01:03:08.535 --> 01:03:12.956
I found that fuckin'
goddamn costume by accident.

01:03:13.123 --> 01:03:17.586
Hundreds of old costumes
used to come through my shop.

01:03:17.753 --> 01:03:20.714
One day, there was
a shipment from Iceland.

01:03:20.881 --> 01:03:25.636
An estate sale
from some Icelandic aristocrat.

01:03:25.803 --> 01:03:30.057
When I opened the crate,
everything was rotted away,

01:03:30.224 --> 01:03:34.144
but this costume,
it was perfect.

01:03:34.311 --> 01:03:37.272
I'd never seen anything like it.

01:03:37.439 --> 01:03:40.192
I was about to sell it
to the Moscow Circus,

01:03:40.359 --> 01:03:43.362
but I wanted to put it
to some good use first.

01:03:43.529 --> 01:03:45.447
My brother was a doctor

01:03:45.614 --> 01:03:48.033
working with children
with terminal illnesses.

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:50.702
He was always trying
to give them hope,

01:03:50.869 --> 01:03:53.705
so I thought,
"Why not cheer 'em up?"

01:03:57.709 --> 01:04:03.465
When the transformation started,
I asked my brother for help.

01:04:03.632 --> 01:04:06.552
He swore he would find a cure.

01:04:07.594 --> 01:04:10.722
That's the last thing
I remember.

01:04:13.183 --> 01:04:16.520
When I woke up,
the suit was off.

01:04:16.687 --> 01:04:20.023
The curse had been broken.

01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:24.236
My brother had given the demon
what it demanded.

01:04:24.403 --> 01:04:26.989
He had smuggled out
from the hospital

01:04:27.155 --> 01:04:31.159
five children close to death,

01:04:31.326 --> 01:04:35.914
one child
for every month of winter.

01:04:38.458 --> 01:04:42.087
So that's it? That's the cure?

01:04:42.254 --> 01:04:43.839
I've spent all these years

01:04:44.006 --> 01:04:47.926
trying to find a clue
how to kill this evil thing.

01:04:48.093 --> 01:04:51.305
My brother never left the house,

01:04:51.471 --> 01:04:53.891
guarding this costume
with his life.

01:04:56.727 --> 01:04:59.396
I didn't even know
that he had passed away

01:04:59.563 --> 01:05:02.816
when... your husband called me.

01:05:03.984 --> 01:05:06.987
Well, why didn't you destroy it?

01:05:07.154 --> 01:05:09.072
Don't you think we tried?

01:05:09.239 --> 01:05:13.243
We tried burning it. We tried to
dissolve it in acid, everything.

01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:15.370
Nothing helped.

01:05:15.537 --> 01:05:17.998
We couldn't just toss it
in the ocean and bury it, could we?

01:05:18.165 --> 01:05:19.791
What if someone else found it?

01:05:21.335 --> 01:05:24.880
Even the smallest piece
carries the curse.

01:05:29.968 --> 01:05:32.304
You have to cut off its head.

01:05:32.471 --> 01:05:37.643
You can't destroy the costume,
but you can stop the demon.

01:05:38.852 --> 01:05:42.147
My husband would never do that.

01:05:45.609 --> 01:05:50.405
This belongs to
a child, seven, eight years old.

01:05:50.572 --> 01:05:53.241
Where did he go?

01:05:53.408 --> 01:05:55.452
Huh?

01:05:55.619 --> 01:05:57.329
I don't know. I...

01:05:57.496 --> 01:06:00.540
You don't know?

01:06:00.707 --> 01:06:03.627
He went to Colton's.

01:06:03.794 --> 01:06:05.754
Where's Colton?

01:06:05.921 --> 01:06:06.797
Jack.

01:06:06.964 --> 01:06:09.216
He's gotta be stopped.

01:06:09.383 --> 01:06:10.968
Jack?

01:06:11.134 --> 01:06:13.887
- We have to kill your daddy.
- Hey!

01:06:14.054 --> 01:06:16.807
Listen to me. Alright, Jack?

01:06:16.974 --> 01:06:18.600
It's not Daddy. It's not.

01:06:18.767 --> 01:06:21.228
It's that suit.
It's making him do bad things.

01:06:21.395 --> 01:06:23.438
But no-one's gonna
hurt Daddy, OK?

01:06:23.605 --> 01:06:26.149
You tell us
there's another way.

01:06:27.818 --> 01:06:29.903
Help me catch him.

01:06:30.988 --> 01:06:33.115
We'll lock him up...

01:06:33.281 --> 01:06:35.993
..continue searching.

01:06:41.498 --> 01:06:43.458
Hey, buddy, what's...

01:06:43.625 --> 01:06:45.168
Shh.

01:06:48.964 --> 01:06:50.674
Hey, sweetie. Everything OK?

01:06:50.841 --> 01:06:52.467
Yeah, I... Dad, I gotta go.

01:06:52.634 --> 01:06:54.678
I can't get into it all right now.
I'm sorry.

01:06:54.845 --> 01:06:57.347
- It's just...
- I gotta go, Dad.

01:07:12.571 --> 01:07:15.782
Careful.
He could still be in here.

01:07:20.245 --> 01:07:22.873
Hey. Hey!

01:07:28.879 --> 01:07:31.298
Oh!

01:07:31.465 --> 01:07:33.008
Oh...

01:07:34.551 --> 01:07:37.429
- Oh!
- Oh, no.

01:07:39.431 --> 01:07:41.725
Don't touch anything, OK?

01:07:41.892 --> 01:07:44.102
We have to call the police.

01:07:46.563 --> 01:07:47.939
Tell 'em what?

01:07:48.106 --> 01:07:51.610
He must have digested him
by now.

01:07:51.777 --> 01:07:53.862
Spit out the bones.

01:07:54.029 --> 01:07:55.739
Oh!

01:07:55.906 --> 01:07:58.116
Couldn't have gone far.

01:07:58.283 --> 01:08:01.536
It's seven o'clock
on a Thursday.

01:08:01.703 --> 01:08:07.501
Where could a clown go
where he's not being seen?

01:08:09.461 --> 01:08:11.129
Oh, no.

01:08:12.464 --> 01:08:14.091
What?

01:08:47.791 --> 01:08:50.585
Hey! You can't go in there
like that.

01:08:50.752 --> 01:08:52.129
Why not?

01:08:52.295 --> 01:08:54.673
You look like
an escaped mental patient.

01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:56.383
Ah.

01:09:02.139 --> 01:09:04.640
Listen. You can't trust
your husband.

01:09:04.808 --> 01:09:07.144
- Don't.
- My brother, he shouldn't...

01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:09.312
You don't know him.

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:12.189
- You don't know what Kent...
- I wish he had killed me.

01:09:13.942 --> 01:09:16.611
- If you love him...
- I know.

01:09:16.778 --> 01:09:19.738
I'll bring him to you.
I promise.

01:10:05.619 --> 01:10:08.163
Happy birthday!

01:10:34.356 --> 01:10:36.024
Shit.

01:10:44.282 --> 01:10:46.368
There's no sign of him.

01:10:52.123 --> 01:10:54.209
Cannonball!

01:10:54.376 --> 01:10:56.127
Oh! Gross!

01:10:56.294 --> 01:10:58.797
Somebody peed in here.

01:11:00.715 --> 01:11:03.802
Greg? Greg?

01:11:03.969 --> 01:11:05.512
Greg?

01:11:07.222 --> 01:11:09.557
Greg?

01:11:09.724 --> 01:11:12.394
Greg, Mom said we have to go.

01:11:13.603 --> 01:11:15.272
Greg?

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:24.239
Greg?

01:11:30.662 --> 01:11:32.205
Greg?

01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:35.625
Greg, where are you?

01:11:42.382 --> 01:11:43.925
Greg?

01:11:46.094 --> 01:11:48.346
Greg, where are you?

01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:53.727
Greg?

01:12:08.908 --> 01:12:10.994
Greg!

01:12:20.128 --> 01:12:22.464
Don't go up there.

01:12:29.888 --> 01:12:31.598
Greg?

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:04.923
There you are.

01:13:11.471 --> 01:13:13.848
No! No!

01:13:15.141 --> 01:13:16.684
Let go of him!

01:13:18.395 --> 01:13:20.688
Run, Greg, run!

01:13:31.908 --> 01:13:33.827
Mom! Mom!

01:13:33.993 --> 01:13:35.912
- Mom, the clown!
- What is it, honey?

01:13:36.079 --> 01:13:38.164
- Up there!
- What?

01:14:00.311 --> 01:14:01.688
Excuse me. What happened?

01:14:01.855 --> 01:14:03.898
There's a maniac dressed as a clown
loose in there.

01:14:04.065 --> 01:14:05.442
Get your kids.

01:14:22.292 --> 01:14:24.961
Hey. Come. Come on.

01:14:30.258 --> 01:14:31.801
See?

01:14:33.178 --> 01:14:35.513
It means he's close.

01:14:41.936 --> 01:14:43.646
What's that for?

01:14:44.898 --> 01:14:46.983
For protection.

01:14:50.403 --> 01:14:51.946
Ah.

01:15:30.527 --> 01:15:32.070
Kent?

01:15:54.092 --> 01:15:55.885
Kent?

01:15:59.973 --> 01:16:01.683
Where am I?

01:16:06.020 --> 01:16:08.523
We're here to help you.

01:16:08.690 --> 01:16:10.733
I know you're scared.

01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:14.529
We're gonna find a way
to stop it, OK?

01:16:14.696 --> 01:16:17.740
We just have to get you
outta here first.

01:16:17.907 --> 01:16:20.702
Karlsson's here.
He... he wants to help you.

01:16:21.786 --> 01:16:23.496
OK, baby?

01:16:25.039 --> 01:16:27.083
I remember him.

01:16:28.167 --> 01:16:30.420
He's crazy.

01:16:30.587 --> 01:16:32.463
He's not.

01:16:34.257 --> 01:16:36.217
He's gonna make sure
no-one else gets hurt.

01:16:36.384 --> 01:16:38.177
- Enough!
- Kent, look out!

01:16:42.223 --> 01:16:43.766
Kent.

01:16:43.933 --> 01:16:45.560
No!

01:16:45.727 --> 01:16:47.478
Kent, no.

01:16:47.645 --> 01:16:49.480
He's gonna help you.

01:16:51.024 --> 01:16:53.401
Uh, Kent, I just...

01:16:53.568 --> 01:16:56.154
Let me help you, please.

01:16:57.780 --> 01:17:00.283
I know you're
still in there. I...

01:17:01.367 --> 01:17:03.995
Come on.
There's gotta be another way.

01:17:07.999 --> 01:17:09.626
Bring me a child.

01:17:12.128 --> 01:17:13.671
Kent?

01:17:15.882 --> 01:17:18.134
Bring me one more child

01:17:18.301 --> 01:17:21.304
and you can have
your husband back.

01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:25.058
Uh... Uh...

01:17:25.224 --> 01:17:27.143
A child!

01:17:27.310 --> 01:17:29.854
I can't. I can't.

01:17:30.938 --> 01:17:32.857
Perhaps I'll find another.

01:17:33.024 --> 01:17:35.401
What's his name?

01:17:35.568 --> 01:17:37.570
Ah, yes.

01:17:37.737 --> 01:17:39.906
Jack!

01:17:42.033 --> 01:17:43.660
No.

01:17:44.786 --> 01:17:48.665
Find a child
and bring him to me.

01:17:48.831 --> 01:17:53.795
Bring him to...
to our favourite spot, babe.

01:17:55.672 --> 01:17:57.757
I'll be waiting.

01:17:59.676 --> 01:18:01.427
- Wait.
- Open the door!

01:18:01.594 --> 01:18:04.639
Come out with your hands up.

01:18:06.224 --> 01:18:08.142
Alright. We are coming in.

01:18:16.192 --> 01:18:18.444
Police! Stay down!

01:18:18.611 --> 01:18:21.030
Stay down on the ground!

01:18:21.197 --> 01:18:23.533
Throw your weapons down!

01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:25.243
Put it down!

01:18:25.410 --> 01:18:27.495
Put it down, motherfucker!

01:18:56.733 --> 01:18:59.110
Dad! You got Jack with you?

01:18:59.277 --> 01:19:00.653
Yes. Of course he's with me.

01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:02.196
He's fine.
Don't worry about it.

01:19:02.363 --> 01:19:05.032
He's being awfully quiet.
I was thinking of taking him home.

01:19:05.199 --> 01:19:07.493
No, you can't go home.
OK, just... just take Jack...

01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:09.579
Just take him and...
and you gotta leave.

01:19:09.746 --> 01:19:12.165
Is Kent at the house? Meg?

01:19:12.331 --> 01:19:15.251
What did Kent do?

01:19:16.878 --> 01:19:19.213
No. It's not Kent, Dad.

01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:20.757
Kent didn't do anything.

01:19:20.923 --> 01:19:22.843
Sweetheart,
please tell me what's going on.

01:19:22.967 --> 01:19:24.886
I'm here to help you.

01:19:25.052 --> 01:19:27.096
Dad, I have to...

01:19:29.807 --> 01:19:31.726
Meg?

01:19:31.893 --> 01:19:33.519
Meg!

01:19:34.604 --> 01:19:36.689
I have to go.

01:19:51.496 --> 01:19:52.872
Hunter!

01:19:53.039 --> 01:19:54.999
Oh, thank you so much.

01:19:55.166 --> 01:19:57.043
Are you looking for your kid?

01:19:58.753 --> 01:20:01.422
Um, no. He's safe.

01:20:07.178 --> 01:20:08.658
Police have confirmed

01:20:08.805 --> 01:20:11.057
that there have been
two fatalities so far,

01:20:11.224 --> 01:20:12.767
both of them children.

01:20:12.934 --> 01:20:15.269
And now we've received
confirmation that

01:20:15.436 --> 01:20:18.898
the authorities do have
at least one suspect in custody,

01:20:19.065 --> 01:20:22.193
a 59-year-old man
named Herbert Karlsson.

01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:25.696
No word yet on whether or not...

01:20:25.863 --> 01:20:28.282
You work
at the dentist's, right?

01:20:28.449 --> 01:20:30.368
Yeah.

01:20:30.535 --> 01:20:33.246
I'm Annie.
I used to go there.

01:20:33.412 --> 01:20:36.374
- OK.
- I was at Chris's birthday party.

01:20:36.541 --> 01:20:38.292
Everything went totally crazy.
And I can't find anybody.

01:20:38.459 --> 01:20:41.003
And my mom dropped me off,
and I don't know where she is.

01:20:41.170 --> 01:20:43.714
I saw you, and I remembered
that you used to be really nice,

01:20:43.881 --> 01:20:45.258
even though the dentist
was kinda scary.

01:20:45.424 --> 01:20:48.678
You used to call him chrome dome
when he left the room.

01:20:48.845 --> 01:20:50.638
Uh-huh.

01:20:50.805 --> 01:20:52.390
Can you drive me home?

01:20:52.557 --> 01:20:54.475
I'm scared.

01:20:56.519 --> 01:20:58.771
You want a ride home?

01:20:58.938 --> 01:21:01.941
Please.
I don't know anyone else.

01:21:07.989 --> 01:21:10.074
You're so nice.

01:21:38.352 --> 01:21:40.271
Sorry I don't know the way.

01:21:40.438 --> 01:21:42.815
Oh, it's alright.
We'll... I know your street.

01:21:42.982 --> 01:21:45.026
So we'll find your house.
Don't worry.

01:21:45.192 --> 01:21:46.611
You're so nice.

01:21:46.777 --> 01:21:48.946
Well, you...

01:21:49.113 --> 01:21:52.658
You know, I... think
if it were my son in trouble,

01:21:52.825 --> 01:21:56.913
I'd wish someone
would help him out, so...

01:23:04.105 --> 01:23:05.481
Are we here?

01:23:05.648 --> 01:23:07.566
Yeah. This is it.

01:23:09.193 --> 01:23:10.903
You're home.

01:23:19.578 --> 01:23:21.038
This isn't...

01:23:26.836 --> 01:23:28.504
This isn't my house.

01:23:29.588 --> 01:23:31.132
This isn't my house!

01:23:33.551 --> 01:23:37.346
Hey, it's scary out here.
Unlock it, please!

01:23:40.516 --> 01:23:43.144
Please. Unlock it, please.

01:23:45.813 --> 01:23:47.231
There's someone out here.

01:23:47.398 --> 01:23:49.859
Please. Please unlock the door.

01:23:50.026 --> 01:23:52.403
Please! PLEASE!

01:23:52.570 --> 01:23:54.905
There's someone out here.
Please unlock the door!

01:23:55.072 --> 01:23:56.991
Please unlock it!

01:23:57.158 --> 01:23:59.410
Unlock the door, please!

01:23:59.577 --> 01:24:01.787
Unlock it, please!

01:24:06.792 --> 01:24:09.086
Please!

01:24:09.253 --> 01:24:11.589
Get in the car! I'm sorry.

01:24:11.756 --> 01:24:14.425
- What are you doing?
- I'm so sorry.

01:24:14.592 --> 01:24:16.343
It's not safe out there!

01:24:16.510 --> 01:24:18.304
Hey!

01:24:18.471 --> 01:24:20.014
No.

01:24:23.267 --> 01:24:25.561
Hey. Wait here.

01:24:36.238 --> 01:24:37.615
Jack.

01:24:42.078 --> 01:24:44.163
Dad, call me back.

01:24:44.330 --> 01:24:45.706
OK?

01:24:45.873 --> 01:24:47.458
Where are you and Jack?

01:24:49.668 --> 01:24:51.754
Home at last.

01:24:53.714 --> 01:24:56.383
OK, let's go and have
a little chat with your dad.

01:25:00.054 --> 01:25:02.181
Stay close to Grandpa.

01:25:42.138 --> 01:25:44.932
Dad! I told you
not to come back here.

01:25:45.099 --> 01:25:46.809
- Where's Jack?
- He's OK.

01:25:46.976 --> 01:25:48.352
He's up in his room.

01:25:48.519 --> 01:25:50.688
Dad, I made a...
I made a mistake.

01:25:50.855 --> 01:25:52.398
Listen. I don't know
what happened.

01:25:52.565 --> 01:25:53.941
I don't care what happened.

01:25:54.108 --> 01:25:55.943
I just don't want you
implicated in this.

01:25:56.110 --> 01:25:59.238
Whatever Kent did, it's OK.
I'm gonna help you, OK?

01:25:59.405 --> 01:26:01.031
I'm gonna help you.

01:26:02.408 --> 01:26:04.451
What are you talking about?

01:26:04.618 --> 01:26:06.912
I'll clean up the blood.

01:26:07.079 --> 01:26:08.789
No-one'll know.

01:26:08.956 --> 01:26:12.251
Baby, you're my little girl.
I love you.

01:26:12.418 --> 01:26:15.087
I...

01:26:25.306 --> 01:26:30.144
One... child... more!

01:26:33.022 --> 01:26:34.565
Ah!

01:27:58.649 --> 01:28:00.567
Run, Jack!

01:28:00.734 --> 01:28:02.820
Jack!

01:28:29.638 --> 01:28:31.390
Clown motherfucker!

01:28:35.436 --> 01:28:37.855
Arggh!

01:28:38.022 --> 01:28:39.648
Ahh!

01:31:43.499 --> 01:31:45.209
Mom?

01:31:45.375 --> 01:31:47.044
Don't watch, Jack.

01:31:47.211 --> 01:31:49.087
OK, we got him.

01:31:51.423 --> 01:31:53.300
Meg...

01:31:58.055 --> 01:31:59.806
..help me.

01:32:03.101 --> 01:32:04.603
We got him.

01:32:04.770 --> 01:32:06.313
Jack?

01:32:07.397 --> 01:32:10.234
Jack. Go get that book.

01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:12.611
What?

01:32:12.778 --> 01:32:15.447
The book Daddy found.

01:32:15.614 --> 01:32:17.699
And... and go get more chains.

01:32:17.866 --> 01:32:19.785
Why?

01:32:19.952 --> 01:32:22.037
Don't you wanna help Daddy?

01:32:22.204 --> 01:32:24.915
That's not Daddy.

01:32:55.070 --> 01:32:57.030
Jack, I'm sorry.

01:32:57.197 --> 01:32:59.700
I'm so sorry.

01:33:11.962 --> 01:33:13.630
Ugh! Ugh!

01:33:44.953 --> 01:33:47.289
Mom.
