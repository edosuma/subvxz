where it might have come from.

09:05.194 --> 09:08.380

- modern lead mines off the table, which is...
- Yes.

All right. So, here we've got
our ablation sequence.

09:21.711 --> 09:22.952
- Everything ran well.
- MARTY: Mm-hmm.

09:22.971 --> 09:25.471
Uh, we got some quite nice data
from it.

09:25.566 --> 09:27.307
Here's the result.

09:27.459 --> 09:29.216
Going through this,

09:29.236 --> 09:33.054
we started out with, you know,
this giant database

09:33.148 --> 09:35.465
of 7,000 records.

09:35.558 --> 09:39.060
And from
that thousands of records,

09:39.079 --> 09:41.654
we can basically pare it down

09:41.807 --> 09:44.231
to maybe...

09:44.251 --> 09:46.901
ten to 12 possible locations.

09:46.995 --> 09:49.546
They're all in, uh, Europe.

09:51.149 --> 09:54.818
The bag seal

09:54.836 --> 09:59.172
has a very European
affinity lead, for sure.

09:59.324 --> 10:02.750
The English signature
doesn't really fit

10:02.769 --> 10:05.178
once you do all the filtering.

10:05.330 --> 10:06.921
- Oh.
- CHRIS: There's nothing North American.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.349
There's nothing Scandinavian.

10:09.501 --> 10:11.776
- And significantly not England.
- CHRIS: No.

10:12.003 --> 10:13.278
No.

10:13.429 --> 10:16.856
- That's the surprise.
- Yeah. - CHRIS: Yeah.

10:17.008 --> 10:19.342
There are several possibilities.
Most of them

10:19.435 --> 10:21.286
- are Mediterranean sources.
- Okay.

10:21.437 --> 10:25.106
And if we whittle it down
as closely as I can get...

10:25.200 --> 10:27.867
- Yes?
- CHRIS: Well,

10:27.961 --> 10:29.352
it's French lead.

10:29.445 --> 10:31.463
- Is it? (chuckles)
- Without a doubt.

10:31.690 --> 10:32.947
- Okay, so...
- MARTY: Would that apply

10:32.966 --> 10:35.208
to our friend the cross, too?

10:35.302 --> 10:37.636
Oh, yeah. Definitely.

10:42.809 --> 10:45.977
<i>CHRIS: It looks like
it's a French source of lead.</i>

10:46.129 --> 10:48.221
Would that apply
to our friend the cross, too?

10:48.373 --> 10:50.390
- Uh, most definitely. Yeah.
- Ah, no kidding?

10:50.484 --> 10:52.651
<i>NARRATOR: At the University
of New Brunswick,</i>

10:52.878 --> 10:55.487
<i>Dr. Chris McFarlane
has just informed</i>

10:55.638 --> 10:57.897
<i>Marty Lagina
and Charles Barkhouse</i>

10:58.049 --> 11:01.067
<i>that the lead used to make
the ancient cargo bag seal</i>

11:01.219 --> 11:04.645
<i>found one year ago just west
of the Oak Island swamp</i>

11:04.665 --> 11:07.481
<i>originated
in the same European region</i>

11:07.575 --> 11:10.669
<i>as the 14th century lead cross.</i>

11:10.896 --> 11:12.504
Yeah, and it's
kind of a big area.

11:12.655 --> 11:13.579
- Yeah.
- CHRIS: But it's-it's known

11:13.732 --> 11:15.581
for its lead mines.

11:15.734 --> 11:17.324
It's still surprising, though.
We were virtually certain,

11:17.419 --> 11:18.843
walking in here,
it'd be English.

11:19.070 --> 11:23.740
The absolute value
plots closest to a couple

11:23.833 --> 11:26.333
- of French sources.
- MARTY: No, it...

11:26.353 --> 11:29.595
Chris, it fits into an entirely
different narrative. Yeah.

11:29.748 --> 11:31.672
Yeah. Yeah.

11:31.692 --> 11:34.417
<i>NARRATOR:
Ever since 2016,</i>

11:34.436 --> 11:36.269
<i>when the late author
Zena Halpern</i>

11:36.363 --> 11:39.088
<i>presented the team
with two maps of Oak Island</i>

11:39.107 --> 11:40.757
<i>that she believed
had been created</i>

11:40.850 --> 11:43.259
<i>by members
of the Knights Templar,</i>

11:43.278 --> 11:46.095
<i>Rick, Marty, Craig and the team</i>

11:46.189 --> 11:47.780
<i>have made
a number of discoveries</i>

11:47.933 --> 11:49.949
<i>that support her belief
that the medieval order</i>

11:50.043 --> 11:53.453
<i>buried a vast treasure
in the Money Pit.</i>

11:53.605 --> 11:57.031
<i>These finds included
the stone-paved area</i>

11:57.125 --> 11:59.459
<i>in the middle of the swamp,
which was scientifically dated</i>

11:59.611 --> 12:02.554
<i>to as early as 1200 AD,</i>

12:02.781 --> 12:06.132
<i>pieces of 15th century
cargo barrels,</i>

12:06.284 --> 12:08.542
<i>and a stone pathway
between the swamp</i>

12:08.636 --> 12:10.119
<i>and the Money Pit.</i>

12:10.138 --> 12:13.306
<i>And the 14th century lead cross,</i>

12:13.458 --> 12:16.809
<i>a cross that was
an exact match in design</i>

12:16.903 --> 12:18.385
<i>to one that Rick saw
carved into the wall</i>

12:18.405 --> 12:22.815
<i>of a 14th century Templar prison
in Domme, France.</i>

12:22.968 --> 12:26.135
<i>Is it possible
that this lead bag seal</i>

12:26.154 --> 12:28.137
<i>is connected
to those discoveries</i>

12:28.156 --> 12:29.639
<i>and offers more evidence</i>

12:29.732 --> 12:33.476
<i>that Zena Halpern's theory
is true?</i>

12:33.495 --> 12:34.753
I think
there could be a connection

12:34.904 --> 12:36.829
between the cross
and the bag seal, I suppose.

12:36.982 --> 12:39.816
<i>We have two lead items
that come from the same area.</i>

12:39.834 --> 12:41.501
<i>Why would I say, "No, they have
nothing to do with each other"?</i>

12:41.653 --> 12:43.428
<i>It leads to some sort</i>

12:43.655 --> 12:46.413
of potential
early French connection

12:46.433 --> 12:48.992
as to what went on here.

12:49.010 --> 12:51.603
That's what's so nice
about dealing with scientists.

12:51.754 --> 12:52.937
- (chuckles)
- You know?

12:53.164 --> 12:54.680
You're gonna say, "Look,
here's what it is."

12:54.775 --> 12:57.108
We had all come around

12:57.260 --> 13:00.353
to an assessment
that the bag seal was British,

13:00.505 --> 13:04.023
and now we find that the lead
had been mined in France.

13:04.117 --> 13:08.011
<i>The hope would be
that it ties to Drayton's cross.</i>

13:08.029 --> 13:09.512
No, that's excellent data.

13:09.531 --> 13:11.289
I mean, it... Here we go again.

13:11.440 --> 13:12.624
Not expected.

13:12.851 --> 13:14.200
Exactly.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.853
MARTY: Being sort
of Rick's emissary here,

13:16.871 --> 13:18.855
he's always trying
to bring the very latest,

13:18.873 --> 13:20.114
the most precise,

13:20.133 --> 13:23.526
the most accurate
scientific data we can.

13:23.545 --> 13:25.545
So, it's kind of our M.O.
And we appreciate

13:25.639 --> 13:28.289
-what you've done here. That's great.
-CHRIS: Mm-hmm.

13:28.383 --> 13:30.366
- MARTY: Thank you very much, sir.
- CHRIS: No, thank you.

13:30.459 --> 13:32.977
<i>- MARTY: Okay, guys, till the next time.
- CHRIS: No problem.</i>

13:35.464 --> 13:37.982
<i>NARRATOR:
Later that afternoon...</i>

13:38.209 --> 13:40.968
Did you get 60 foot
of casing in the ground?

13:40.987 --> 13:42.545
VANESSA:
I have 61.

13:42.638 --> 13:44.322
<i>while the excavation
continues</i>

13:44.549 --> 13:46.974
<i>in the TF-1 shaft

13:46.993 --> 13:49.569
<i>ALEX: This looks like
a level spot to set up.</i>

13:49.721 --> 13:51.054
<i>NARRATOR:
near the southeastern edge</i>

13:51.072 --> 13:53.314
<i>- of the triangle-shaped swamp...</i>
- Okay.

13:53.408 --> 13:55.558
<i>Alex Lagina and his cousin</i>

13:55.577 --> 13:57.818
<i>David Fornetti
are hoping to find</i>

13:57.838 --> 14:00.654
<i>more evidence of a curious
stone feature that the team</i>

14:00.674 --> 14:02.340
<i>uncovered earlier this year.</i>

14:02.567 --> 14:04.067
So,

14:04.085 --> 14:06.586
I figure
since we can't dig here,

14:06.738 --> 14:10.348
the only way to follow the road
is with GPR.

14:10.499 --> 14:12.742
We can at least scan the area
and see

14:12.760 --> 14:14.260
if we can pick up,
like, any kind of sign

14:14.412 --> 14:16.095
of the stone road
as it heads out of the swamp,

14:16.247 --> 14:18.523
- up the hill towards the Money Pit.
- Okay.

14:18.750 --> 14:20.341
<i>STEVE G.:
I don't have an opinion.</i>

14:20.360 --> 14:21.767
I have facts.

14:21.920 --> 14:23.436
<i>NARRATOR:
Earlier this year,</i>

14:23.530 --> 14:26.606
<i>while looking for clues
near the massive stone wharf,</i>

14:26.758 --> 14:30.017
<i>the team uncovered a completely
separate stone pathway.</i>

14:30.036 --> 14:31.928
STEVE G.: So, this is the
cobble path from last year.

14:32.021 --> 14:33.687
It hits the cobble
that we found this year,

14:33.707 --> 14:35.781
which is what we're standing on.

14:35.876 --> 14:38.359
And, so, when you project this
path, it heads to the Money Pit.

14:38.378 --> 14:41.695
- That's interesting.
- IAN: This is what we've been looking for.

14:41.715 --> 14:43.623
Right.

14:43.775 --> 14:46.885
- What you got?
- I have a piece of pottery.

14:47.036 --> 14:50.037
<i>NARRATOR: However,
as archaeologist Laird Niven</i>

14:50.056 --> 14:53.391
<i>began carefully exposing
the feature, he discovered</i>

14:53.542 --> 14:55.785
<i>pieces
of indigenous Mi'kmaw pottery...</i>

14:55.878 --> 14:57.286
LAIRD:
It's definitely Mi'kmaw.

14:57.305 --> 14:58.396
<i>leading to a stunning mandate</i>

14:58.623 --> 15:00.732
<i>by the provincial
government agency</i>

15:00.883 --> 15:04.460
<i>known as Community,
Culture and Heritage.</i>

15:04.479 --> 15:06.887
Community, Culture and Heritage

15:06.981 --> 15:08.239
asked that we stop work

15:08.466 --> 15:10.633
at the area

15:10.652 --> 15:12.226
where we were finding
the artifacts.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.411
I see.

15:15.156 --> 15:17.898
<i>NARRATOR: The mandate
restricted all further investigation</i>

15:17.918 --> 15:20.919
<i>of the feature in the southeast
corner of the swamp.</i>

15:21.146 --> 15:24.480
<i>However,
because the feature may continue</i>

15:24.499 --> 15:26.149
<i>up toward the Money Pit,</i>

15:26.242 --> 15:28.668
<i>it is Rick,
Marty and Craig's hope</i>

15:28.820 --> 15:31.078
<i>that if they can find
more evidence of the path</i>

15:31.097 --> 15:33.097
<i>outside the restricted zone,</i>

15:33.249 --> 15:36.008
<i>they can obtain a special permit

15:36.161 --> 15:37.584
<i>confirm where it leads,</i>

15:37.604 --> 15:39.178
<i>and find more clues</i>

15:39.272 --> 15:42.440
<i>that could help solve
the Oak Island mystery.</i>

15:43.685 --> 15:46.169
Okay. About here, you think?

15:46.262 --> 15:47.837
DAVID F.:
Yeah, I think that should work.

15:47.855 --> 15:50.097
ALEX:
First scan coming up.

15:50.191 --> 15:52.433
<i>NARRATOR: In order
to conduct their search,</i>

15:52.452 --> 15:57.680
<i>Alex and David are using
an OKM Gepard GPR 3D scanner.</i>

15:57.699 --> 15:59.440
<i>The device works</i>

15:59.459 --> 16:02.518
<i>by emitting electromagnetic
pulses into the ground</i>

16:02.611 --> 16:05.129
<i>to create a 3D visualization</i>

16:05.281 --> 16:07.948
<i>of potential objects,

(beeping slowly)

16:18.812 --> 16:20.553
(beeps rapidly)

16:20.705 --> 16:22.221
- Okay.
<i>- MARTY: This OKM</i>

ground-penetrating radar.

16:25.893 --> 16:29.061
- About here?
- Yeah. Might cheat a little bit this way.

16:29.214 --> 16:31.731
- Okay.
<i>- MARTY: This technology</i>

16:31.883 --> 16:35.218
<i>might be able to trace
the paved road from the swamp</i>

16:35.311 --> 16:37.311
<i>up the hill
towards the Money Pit.</i>

16:37.330 --> 16:39.313
If we can see these anomalies

16:39.332 --> 16:41.724
and we think they're the road,
well, we can dig it.

16:41.743 --> 16:44.168
- This'll be seven, so that's probably your last one.
- ALEX: Okay.

16:44.395 --> 16:47.154
<i>RICK:

16:47.173 --> 16:49.007
<i>something very significant,</i>

16:49.234 --> 16:51.734
and we can take
that information to CCH

16:51.753 --> 16:54.920
and say, "Guys, here, look.

16:55.073 --> 16:56.830
<i>Here's the data.
Here's the empirical evidence."</i>

16:56.850 --> 16:58.165
ALEX:
Okay.

16:58.259 --> 16:59.684
Let's take a look.

16:59.835 --> 17:01.911
<i>RICK:

<i>"from an archaeological

17:09.087 --> 17:11.587
ALEX:
Let's see if we got anything.

17:11.680 --> 17:14.699
That looks pretty good.
Look at that.

17:14.850 --> 17:17.184
DAVID F.:
Oh, that's interesting. I mean,

17:17.203 --> 17:19.203
we started on the stone road.

17:19.355 --> 17:21.764
- What was exposed.
- ALEX: Mm-hmm.

17:21.857 --> 17:25.692
And at roughly the same depth,

17:25.712 --> 17:29.696
there is a consistent feature
or anomaly about the same width

17:29.716 --> 17:32.775
-that runs...
-ALEX: Right along with it. Yeah.

17:32.868 --> 17:34.701
So, we might be picking it up.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.962
Even-even in the upland there

17:37.057 --> 17:39.557
where we thought it ended,
it might still continue.

17:39.784 --> 17:41.059
Incredibly,
there's a good chance

17:41.210 --> 17:42.393
the stone road
is under us right here.

17:43.805 --> 17:45.688
<i>I think we might have found it.</i>

17:50.645 --> 17:52.719
<i>ALEX: I think the stone road

17:52.814 --> 17:54.647
I think we might have found it.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.223
And it continues

17:56.317 --> 17:59.302
all the way along the scan,

17:59.395 --> 18:00.820
- which is really good.
- DAVID F.: Yeah.

18:00.914 --> 18:02.988
<i>NARRATOR:
Using ground-penetrating radar,</i>

18:03.083 --> 18:06.992
<i>Alex Lagina and David Fornetti

<i>possible evidence
of a buried stone pathway</i>

18:09.255 --> 18:11.738
<i>running between the
southeast corner of the swamp</i>

18:11.833 --> 18:13.983
<i>and the Money Pit.</i>

18:14.076 --> 18:16.761
I think
if we try and catch it further

18:16.988 --> 18:18.821
in the upland, it might be worth
taking a run or two

18:18.840 --> 18:20.506
if we can find an area that,

18:20.658 --> 18:22.007
you know,
we can have a clear pass.

18:22.160 --> 18:24.327
Sure. I-I'm all for that.

18:24.345 --> 18:27.605
- I think we should do one right here, actually.
- All right. Cool.

18:27.756 --> 18:29.756
I think we found the
continuation of the stone road

18:29.851 --> 18:31.834
<i>as it heads up out of the swamp</i>

Okay, I'll do the first round.

18:34.263 --> 18:35.762
You do the next one. Start here.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.506
- Sounds good.
- See if it goes under here.

18:37.525 --> 18:40.118
If we can follow this thing
far enough,

18:40.269 --> 18:42.678
we get outside
of this no-go zone,

18:42.697 --> 18:44.288
uh, then we can dig it,

18:44.515 --> 18:46.682
<i>and it's actually gonna give us
some artifacts.</i>

<i>a date
and maybe tell us who did it.</i>

18:53.040 --> 18:55.374

18:57.303 --> 18:59.378

18:59.530 --> 19:02.198
- I know I got caught on something there, but...
- Yep.

19:02.216 --> 19:04.216
Hopefully it doesn't matter.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.394
Let's see what we got.

19:07.796 --> 19:10.055
I mean, that looks a lot
like what we were seeing.

19:10.150 --> 19:12.275
DAVID F.: I'd imagine
it's about the same depth.

19:14.988 --> 19:16.879
It looks about right,
I mean, it's the same...

19:16.972 --> 19:19.657
Looks like it's
about the same width.

19:21.161 --> 19:23.143
- Now that's saying five feet deep.
- But we've come

19:23.237 --> 19:25.329
- out of the swamp and into the uplands, so...
- Yeah. So we know

19:25.481 --> 19:26.555
there was
a lot of activity here.

19:26.649 --> 19:28.166
Maybe it's been covered over.

DAVID F.: You know, one of
the things that I'm thinking...

19:52.600 --> 19:55.008
I wonder
if we try and figure out

19:55.028 --> 19:56.585
where we're getting these hits

19:56.604 --> 19:58.270

is going straight.

You know,

20:01.868 --> 20:03.426
if we think we have it,
we need to mark it. I agree.

20:03.519 --> 20:05.594
We'll call Steve
and come have him come in

20:05.613 --> 20:07.038

shoot some GPS points.

20:07.265 --> 20:08.614

Couple of interesting pieces,

- GARY: Yeah.

21:30.014 --> 21:33.365

- This came out of the exact zone

22:26.404 --> 22:28.404
that Terry noted
was loose, disturbed materials.

22:28.497 --> 22:30.756
So that could be
part of a tunnel.

22:30.908 --> 22:34.018
MARTY: Well, what's it
telling us, though? What about

22:34.245 --> 22:35.911
- metal detecting? Anything?
- GARY: Nothing.

22:35.930 --> 22:38.097
I mean, we've found
lots of notched timbers.

22:38.191 --> 22:41.692
- Any saw blade marks?
- ALEX: Yeah. If you hold it

22:41.844 --> 22:44.010
like this,

22:44.105 --> 22:46.197
the saw cuts are at that angle.

22:46.424 --> 22:47.865
- So it could be vertical.
- Yeah, and if this...

22:48.016 --> 22:49.775
and if this side
was not parallel to this side,

22:49.869 --> 22:51.685

would be straight up and down.

22:51.779 --> 22:53.019
RICK:
Okay. Here's the info.

It's a great day to be digging.

Um, so,
we're at 81 with the can.

22:58.436 --> 23:01.286
- 76 and a half with the dig. Yeah.
- MARTY: Okay. Where...

23:01.439 --> 23:03.547
Where exactly
did the metal come out of?

23:03.699 --> 23:06.717
- Does anybody know?
- About 88, 89.

That's the thing
that makes sense to me.

23:28.241 --> 23:30.557
That's the thing that
has always made sense to me.

23:30.651 --> 23:32.818

Could the treasure</i>

23:32.912 --> 23:35.413

the treasure is at this depth

to the wash plant.

Hard to say on that.

26:09.068 --> 26:11.293

know, I can't explain it.

28:54.382 --> 28:55.399
VANESSA:
Maybe you're bouncing on wood.

28:55.550 --> 28:56.975
Maybe you're not
getting to the bottom.

28:57.069 --> 28:58.718
I'll go ask them if they're
okay with us continuing down.

28:58.738 --> 29:00.237
Okay.

29:00.388 --> 29:01.238
All right, I'll go let 'em know.

29:03.984 --> 29:05.650
- Hello.
- MARTY: Hi.

29:05.803 --> 29:07.302
All right, we've gone down two
more feet with the oscillator,

29:07.395 --> 29:08.728
and we took out our three grabs.

29:08.748 --> 29:10.806
Um...

29:10.899 --> 29:12.232
You see he's not getting much.

29:12.251 --> 29:13.417
MARTY:
Yeah.

29:13.644 --> 29:15.160
VANESSA:
He's hitting something hard.

29:15.312 --> 29:16.903
MARTY: So, there's
something in the way.

29:16.922 --> 29:18.422
VANESSA:
Yeah.

29:18.573 --> 29:19.715
I can't guarantee
we're getting to the bottom.

29:22.094 --> 29:24.152
With your guys' blessing, we
want to take a few more grabs?

29:24.171 --> 29:26.579
- Definitely an anomaly going on.
- Rick needs to be involved in this.

29:26.599 --> 29:27.747
Okay.

29:27.767 --> 29:29.082
- I'm getting him.
- ALEX: Okay.

29:37.001 --> 29:39.109
You really
should come back up there now.

at decision points.

They are doing that very thing,

29:54.627 --> 29:57.610
Something's changed. Little bit
of an anomaly going on.

29:57.630 --> 29:59.688

He wasn't getting full scoops.

29:59.706 --> 30:01.373
RICK:
What do you make of that?

30:01.525 --> 30:03.133
VANESSA: We're-we're
monitoring it, but weird.

30:03.285 --> 30:05.285
Um, the can's still at 83.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.471
We did not advance that because
we have a nine-foot plug.

30:07.622 --> 30:09.881
We're not seeing
anything abnormal.

30:10.034 --> 30:11.642
We're not seeing anything
that's indicating

30:11.793 --> 30:14.294
that we're going through
easy, smooth sand, right?

30:14.313 --> 30:16.721
The oscillator has been
reacting steadily

30:16.874 --> 30:18.965
- the entire time.
- So, the mystery isn't the oscillator.

30:19.059 --> 30:20.542
The mystery is why that's not
coming up with anything.

30:20.561 --> 30:22.227

- I see.

30:35.501 --> 30:38.669
Vanessa has suggested that
there's some sort of obstruction

30:38.820 --> 30:41.154
at this depth--
90-foot, give or take.

30:41.173 --> 30:45.083
Well, 90-foot conjures up
the-the original Money Pit.

30:45.177 --> 30:46.993
As long as he concurs,

30:47.012 --> 30:48.512
why don't you hit it a little
harder and see what we got.

30:48.663 --> 30:52.015
- But I would not advance the pipe yet.
- I agree.

30:52.242 --> 30:53.166
I agree.

30:53.185 --> 30:55.835
Okay. Will do.

30:55.855 --> 30:58.671
Yeah. If it was in situ,

30:58.691 --> 31:02.417
I would expect big chunks
of clay to be stuck to it still.

31:02.436 --> 31:04.486
I don't know.
Don't know what it means.

31:09.869 --> 31:12.536
What odds would you put
on us putting this thing down

31:12.687 --> 31:14.763
and not getting any metal?

31:14.781 --> 31:16.039
I was just thinking that.

31:16.266 --> 31:19.543

38:03.264 --> 38:06.190
<i>the team from
Irving Equipment Limited</i>

38:06.343 --> 38:09.193
<i>and ROC Equipment
must now wait for morning</i>

38:09.346 --> 38:11.179
<i>before they can continue
unearthing spoils</i>

38:11.197 --> 38:15.033
<i>and hopefully something
of incredible value.</i>

38:15.127 --> 38:17.018
- CRAIG: Hey, Vanessa.
- VANESSA: Gentlemen.

38:17.037 --> 38:18.353
MARTY:
Where's the gold?

38:18.371 --> 38:20.297
(laughter)

38:20.448 --> 38:22.114
VANESSA: Just wanted
to give you guys an update.

38:22.134 --> 38:23.875
Uh, we are finishing up
for the night.

38:24.027 --> 38:26.136
The can is at, uh, 101 feet

38:26.363 --> 38:29.547
and the excavation
is at 92 and a half feet.

38:29.641 --> 38:31.457
- Okay.
- MARTY: All right, well,

38:31.551 --> 38:33.718
we are working on a new theory,

38:33.870 --> 38:37.147
actually promoted
by Dr. Crowell over here.

38:37.298 --> 38:38.964
- Correct? Why don't you talk...
- Yeah.

38:38.984 --> 38:40.966
- Why don't you tell them real quick, huh?
- All right.

38:41.061 --> 38:41.985
DOUG:
Well, this thing here,

38:42.136 --> 38:43.728
which was
a little disappointing,

38:43.822 --> 38:47.231
Laird and I found a name
along the top rim, it's Kaufman.

38:47.326 --> 38:49.567
That company was a Canadian
rubber company

38:49.719 --> 38:53.163
making boots around 1908, 1909.

38:53.390 --> 38:56.624
And, well, this-this
could be FDR's boot.

38:57.985 --> 38:59.652
Or part of the expedition.

38:59.671 --> 39:01.896
DOUG: Why that's good is,
we know they were working

39:01.915 --> 39:03.840
alongside what they believed
to be the Money Pit.

39:04.067 --> 39:06.009
That could account for the new
and old wood we're seeing.

39:07.846 --> 39:10.663
I think we just rolled
the clock back 112 years

39:10.757 --> 39:11.997
and we're now on the site

39:12.017 --> 39:14.409
of what they were
exploring in 1909.

39:14.427 --> 39:16.353
BILLY: There's only
one flaw in that is,

39:16.580 --> 39:18.913
they didn't find it, so it's
no good to go in the same place.

39:18.932 --> 39:20.673
- They didn't get deep enough, right?
- Well...

39:20.692 --> 39:22.525
DOUG: Right. And... we
found a piece of gold here.

39:22.752 --> 39:24.194
They didn't.

39:24.345 --> 39:26.588
And I got 60 more feet
of casing.

39:26.681 --> 39:28.365
(laughter)

39:28.592 --> 39:33.352
When Doug and Laird
date the boot to 1908, 1909,

39:33.372 --> 39:35.930
<i>it sort of changes
in importance to me.</i>

39:35.949 --> 39:40.785
<i>Now we want to proceed because
it ties with Doug's awakening</i>

39:40.879 --> 39:43.271
<i>to the possibility
that we're digging in the shaft</i>

39:43.289 --> 39:45.607
<i>that Roosevelt dug in.</i>

39:45.625 --> 39:48.776
<i>And that shaft was near
the original Money Pit.</i>

39:48.870 --> 39:51.370
<i>So hope sort of rises again
a little bit.</i>

39:51.390 --> 39:53.798
We might find
some things deeper.

39:53.892 --> 39:57.619
Okay, so we will
declare victory for today.

39:57.637 --> 40:00.138
Go home, get some sleep,
back in the morning.

40:00.290 --> 40:01.731
- Okay.
- RICK: I'm gonna declare

40:01.883 --> 40:03.733
"We're not giving up."

40:03.885 --> 40:06.144
And, you know,
with that rationale,

40:06.238 --> 40:07.812
I mean, it makes sense, right?

40:07.964 --> 40:10.648
But the proof is down that hole.

40:10.742 --> 40:12.634
And, uh, we're not gonna give up

40:12.652 --> 40:14.911
till we figure out
what that hole has to tell us.

40:15.138 --> 40:17.062
That's where I'm at.

40:17.157 --> 40:19.157
I'm not bothered
that we haven't made

40:19.251 --> 40:22.085
the bravo-tango, uh, call yet.

40:22.236 --> 40:24.754
I know it's coming,
or I certainly believe it is.

40:24.906 --> 40:27.239
<i>The fact
that we haven't achieved</i>

40:27.333 --> 40:30.835
<i>what we had hoped to achieve
at this depth is immaterial.</i>

40:30.987 --> 40:34.079
<i>The good news is,
I believe we're close.</i>

40:34.099 --> 40:36.841
<i>Tomorrow the sun will rise,
the can will go down.</i>

40:36.935 --> 40:38.751
<i>The work continues.</i>

40:38.770 --> 40:39.936
We moved the dial.

40:40.163 --> 40:41.345
Yep.

40:41.498 --> 40:43.014
MARTY:
That is one heavy dial

40:43.108 --> 40:45.016
we're trying to move,
I'll tell you that.

40:45.168 --> 40:47.518
- Tomorrow! Tomorrow's the day.
- There you go.

40:47.671 --> 40:50.021
Tomorrow's always the day.
Until it's today.

40:50.115 --> 40:52.023
- We're not done yet.
- Yeah.

40:52.117 --> 40:54.951
<i>NARRATOR: For Rick,
Marty, Craig and their team,</i>

40:55.178 --> 40:58.455
<i>it has already been a year
of unprecedented advances</i>

40:58.682 --> 41:02.850
<i>toward solving
a 227-year-old mystery.</i>

41:02.869 --> 41:06.688
<i>From ancient artifacts
and structures</i>

41:06.706 --> 41:08.948
<i>that date back centuries older
than anything</i>

41:09.042 --> 41:11.526
<i>ever discovered on Oak Island</i>

41:11.544 --> 41:14.045
<i>to scientific evidence
of gold and silver</i>

41:14.197 --> 41:16.698
<i>buried deep in the Money Pit,</i>

41:16.791 --> 41:19.383
<i>what was once thought
to be legend</i>

41:19.536 --> 41:22.220
<i>now appears to be certain.</i>

41:22.372 --> 41:26.149
<i>And as they dig deeper
than ever before,</i>

41:26.376 --> 41:28.968
<i>can anything stop them
from revealing</i>

41:29.062 --> 41:31.321
<i>the ultimate answers?</i>

41:34.718 --> 41:37.719
<i>Next time</i>
<i>on</i> The Curse of Oak Island...

41:37.737 --> 41:39.053
<i>MARTY: What a good
day to find treasure.</i>

41:39.072 --> 41:40.071
Oh, look at that.

41:40.165 --> 41:42.314
- ALEX: Is that concrete?
- Yeah.

41:42.334 --> 41:44.501
<i>JACK: We could be
close to the actual vault.</i>

41:44.652 --> 41:46.819
- RICK: Whoa!
- VANESSA: The hammer grab

41:46.913 --> 41:48.563
is grabbing on something
that's too heavy

41:48.581 --> 41:50.565
- to pull back out.
- Wow.

41:50.583 --> 41:52.658
MARTY: There's got to be
something in that clay right there.

41:52.677 --> 41:54.660
-(beeping) -GARY: That's a
screamer, mate. Come on, baby.

41:54.679 --> 41:57.162
Come to Papa. Wow.

41:57.182 --> 42:00.183
- Let's see what the machine says.
- Okay.

42:00.410 --> 42:01.518
- MARTY: That's gold.
- KELLY: Absolutely.

42:01.669 --> 42:02.852
That's just amazing.
