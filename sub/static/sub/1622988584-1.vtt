WEBVTT

00:50.183 --> 00:53.810
In the teacher's hair?

00:53.912 --> 00:58.319
When she's not there?

00:58.421 --> 01:02.126
On her chair?

01:02.228 --> 01:05.954
The Phantom strikes again

01:06.056 --> 01:10.266
In the brand-new car?

01:10.368 --> 01:14.170
In the cookie jar?

01:14.272 --> 01:18.340
In Dad's cigar?

01:18.442 --> 01:22.213
The Phantom strikes again

01:31.025 --> 01:34.916
Away?

01:35.019 --> 01:38.921
Night and day?

01:39.023 --> 01:43.101
From Dad's toupee?

01:43.203 --> 01:46.831
The Phantom strikes again

02:20.573 --> 02:21.767
Hello?

02:51.270 --> 02:54.503
-

03:11.684 --> 03:13.391
Very good.

03:13.493 --> 03:16.219
Now, if that's not the sound
of being a man, I'm deaf.

03:16.322 --> 03:20.089
-We're talking about laying
down the damn law

03:20.191 --> 03:22.229
-and standing up
for yourself.
-

03:22.331 --> 03:24.427
Oh, going the speed limit, huh?

03:24.529 --> 03:27.270
It's funny, if I'm going
the speed limit, and you're
going faster than me,

03:27.373 --> 03:29.465
that means you're going
above the speed limit.

03:29.567 --> 03:31.102
If you're done being nice
for no reason, I want you
to scream.

03:32.903 --> 03:34.376
-Chapter five.
-

03:34.478 --> 03:36.874
Let's all chant the word
"balls." Balls.

03:36.976 --> 03:39.276
-Balls, balls, balls.
-Balls, balls, balls.

03:43.415 --> 03:47.657
Who lived on 40 acres
Of bad land...

03:47.760 --> 03:51.727
-Hi, this is Charlotte.
Leave a message. Bye.

03:51.830 --> 03:53.431
Hi, love.

03:53.533 --> 03:57.394
Just want to let you know
that I am almost to my new post,

03:57.496 --> 03:58.732
which is exciting.

04:00.872 --> 04:03.072
Anyway, call me.

04:03.174 --> 04:05.468
Would love to hear your voice.

04:05.570 --> 04:07.079
You know, or don't.

04:07.181 --> 04:10.010
You don't have to
if you don't want to.

04:10.112 --> 04:13.008
Actually, no.

04:13.110 --> 04:15.516
I would like if you would
call me, please.

04:15.618 --> 04:19.352
This is me saying
what I want, so there.

04:19.455 --> 04:23.455
-Okay, well, it's Finn.

04:23.557 --> 04:25.863
Love you. Call me. Okay, bye.

04:25.965 --> 04:31.197
Balls! It's healthy. Balls.
Balls. Balls. Balls!

04:34.467 --> 04:40.510
And you couldn't love
The likes of me

04:42.980 --> 04:49.112
I've got to see about
My Texas tea

04:53.351 --> 04:56.121
Absolutely.
Good afternoon to you as well.

04:56.223 --> 04:58.823
Well, if you've got
no supplies to make,
make some now,

04:58.925 --> 05:02.199
as the storm is going
to be a big one.

05:02.301 --> 05:04.369
We're talking about
a crippling...

05:05.836 --> 05:07.630
Hi.

05:07.732 --> 05:09.308
Where can I find the...?

05:13.307 --> 05:14.742
Thank you.

05:14.844 --> 05:17.477
-Mr. Parker, I told you--
-Excuse me, Miss Sherwin,

05:17.579 --> 05:21.246
I told you that I'm here
to listen.

05:21.348 --> 05:22.646
It's Sherman.

05:22.748 --> 05:24.987
See, it's just, I'm worried.

05:25.089 --> 05:28.056
Now, this pipeline is a feat
of human ingenuity. I mean,
look at this.

05:28.158 --> 05:34.663
This is plastic, cradled
in steel laying underground
in Portland cement.

05:34.765 --> 05:37.499
I'll cut you a generous check,
easy as a signature.

05:37.601 --> 05:41.335
-And-- What-what is so funny?

05:41.437 --> 05:43.266
It's just the-- It's the irony.

05:43.368 --> 05:46.712
I've got an environmentalist
staying on the second floor.

05:46.814 --> 05:50.541
-See, I'm concerned that--
-Hon, hon, hon, I got
environmental guys.

05:50.643 --> 05:55.209
I got MIT guys that are smarter
than some environmentalist
on the second floor.

05:55.312 --> 05:58.049
Okay? They do
lots of impact studies, they--

05:58.151 --> 06:01.257
-Hi, I don't mean to interrupt.
-Oh, no. Please do.

06:01.359 --> 06:02.721
-Can I help you?
-Are you Jeanine?

06:02.823 --> 06:05.925
Yeah, I-- You must be
the new ranger.

06:06.027 --> 06:08.796
Yeah.
I'm Finn Wheeler,
US Forest Service.

06:08.898 --> 06:11.430
-Oh, I'm Jeanine Sherman.
-Sam Parker, Midland Gas.

06:11.532 --> 06:13.428
Oh, what a coinkydink.

06:13.530 --> 06:16.804
-Excuse me?
-The pipeline, right?
That's your project?

06:16.906 --> 06:19.406
-It is.
-Yeah, I'm going to be stationed
in Beaverfield

06:19.509 --> 06:21.245
for the duration
of construction.

06:21.347 --> 06:23.739
-Well, lucky me.
-Should it go through.

06:23.841 --> 06:25.878
It will. I'm confident.

06:25.980 --> 06:29.046
Has to be
a majority vote, Mr. Parker.

06:29.148 --> 06:32.150
Sure is a lot
of beautiful nature here.

06:32.252 --> 06:35.788
It'd be a shame to break ground
so close to a national forest.

06:35.890 --> 06:38.395
A man that doesn't
want to conquer nature

06:38.498 --> 06:40.932
doesn't understand
how brutal it is, Ranger.

06:41.034 --> 06:43.501
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

06:43.603 --> 06:46.097
I wasn't trying to be like,
"Oh, it'd be a shame."

06:46.199 --> 06:49.731
-I wasn't trying to make a--
-May I take your luggage?

06:49.833 --> 06:52.233
Oh, uh, miss?

06:52.335 --> 06:55.137
Yeah, uh, Jeanine, you know,
I can get that.

06:55.239 --> 06:58.148
Nope. Breakfast is 7:00
to 9:00 in the café,

06:58.251 --> 07:01.309
and then we reopen again
at noon.

07:01.411 --> 07:03.919
For now, I'm the only game
in town, food-wise,

07:04.021 --> 07:07.154
good for business, though,
especially with the storm
coming.

07:07.256 --> 07:08.589
What a night.

07:08.691 --> 07:10.453
Yeah, I hear we got
a big one coming.

07:10.555 --> 07:13.594
Probably overblown.
Local news guys just love
fearmongering.

07:13.696 --> 07:16.531
Hey, Jeanine!
We got café customers.

07:16.633 --> 07:17.926
Do you want me
to take care of it?

07:18.028 --> 07:20.864
No. I'll make them sandwiches.

07:20.966 --> 07:23.132
All of your pictures are--
I got.

07:23.234 --> 07:25.633
Do you mind helping
the ranger get settled?

07:25.736 --> 07:28.645
Yeah, you go run this place
'cause you're my damn hero,
okay?

07:29.940 --> 07:32.311
-Hi, Ranger.
-Oh, Finn.

07:32.413 --> 07:34.281
Finn Wheeler.

07:34.383 --> 07:36.045
You're the mailman.

07:36.147 --> 07:37.955
Person.
Yeah, gender is a construct.

07:38.057 --> 07:39.222
-Cecily.
-Hey.

07:39.324 --> 07:43.017
Oh, I have mail for the ranger.

07:43.120 --> 07:44.991
really?
-Uh-huh.

07:45.727 --> 07:47.562
Not littering.
I'm just excited.

07:47.664 --> 07:50.034
Yeah, not judging.
Just watching it.

07:50.136 --> 07:54.338
"I'm writing to inform you
of Emerson Flint's commercial
trapping activity." Hmm.

07:54.440 --> 07:56.505
"Contact local authorities.

07:56.607 --> 07:59.401
Sincerely, Dr. Jane Ellis,
PhD, DVM,

07:59.503 --> 08:02.010
and professor of zoology,
and environmental studies.

08:02.113 --> 08:03.878
Room 207."

08:05.814 --> 08:09.148
-Well, ka-ching,
I've got a case.
-A case.

08:09.250 --> 08:12.747
Yeah, I'm going to head over
to this guy, Flint's place.

08:12.849 --> 08:14.315
Can I walk that?

08:14.418 --> 08:16.393
It's a bit of a schlep,
yeah, but I can show you

08:16.495 --> 08:18.161
'cause I have a delivery
out that way.

08:18.263 --> 08:19.692
If that's okay.

08:19.794 --> 08:21.257
-It's totally okay. Okay.
-Okay.

08:21.359 --> 08:23.195
-Hey, go ahead and...
-I'm just going to change.

08:23.297 --> 08:27.170
...put on your ranger gear,
or warm your steed, or-- Okay.

08:27.272 --> 08:29.068
-Okay. Yeah.
-Bye.

08:31.708 --> 08:34.202
So you live at the inn?
-I do.

08:34.304 --> 08:36.106
-Yeah, it's pretty sweet, right?
-Yeah.

08:36.209 --> 08:38.377
I rented a room
when I first transferred jobs

08:38.479 --> 08:41.284
thinking that I'd eventually
get a place in town,
but I don't know,

08:41.387 --> 08:42.951
two days turned
into four weeks,

08:43.053 --> 08:45.118
and Jeanine
wouldn't let me leave,
and so I was like,

08:45.220 --> 08:47.622
"Oh, you want me to help you
tidy some rooms in exchange

08:47.724 --> 08:50.026
for staying
at your sweet-ass mansh?

08:50.128 --> 08:51.029
Yes, please."

08:51.131 --> 08:52.727
-"Mansh"?
-Mansion.

08:52.829 --> 08:55.063
-Oh, right.
-Want some hot Beaverfield goss?

08:55.166 --> 08:56.533
Uh, yeah.

08:56.635 --> 08:59.598
So, Jeanine's husband
met a woman at a bar

08:59.700 --> 09:03.034
and they ran off together.

09:03.136 --> 09:06.072
Jeanine hasn't really been
the same since.

09:09.577 --> 09:11.072
-Dang.
-Yeah.

09:11.174 --> 09:13.749
Word is, they left for Belize.

09:13.851 --> 09:16.817
-Ouch.
-I hear Belize sucks
this time of year.

09:16.919 --> 09:19.888
Unlike Beaverfield,
real fucking sunshiny.

09:21.054 --> 09:22.490
Should've packed
our snowshoes.

09:22.593 --> 09:25.229
What?
People do that?

09:25.331 --> 09:26.490
-What, snowshoeing?
-Yeah.

09:26.593 --> 09:28.324
Oh, sure.

09:28.426 --> 09:31.232
You know, fun fact,
not only is it the oldest,

09:31.334 --> 09:34.836
but remains one of the most
effective means of traversing
the ice,

09:34.938 --> 09:37.566
and snow, of course,
because it's snowshoeing.

09:37.668 --> 09:39.137
Wow.

09:39.239 --> 09:41.611
Yeah, you're going
to fit right in at Beaverfield.

09:41.713 --> 09:44.009
Everyone here
is a little questionable.

09:44.112 --> 09:46.409
You know, the weather,
the people, everything.

09:50.418 --> 09:52.086
Fancy.

09:52.188 --> 09:54.685
Devon's a tech dude,
and Joaquim runs the yoga sitch.

09:54.787 --> 09:57.996
like an ex-city,
nature-loving, millionaire
power couple.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.490
You know the type.

09:59.593 --> 10:01.226
Hi, boys!

10:03.534 --> 10:05.465
This is Finny, the new ranger.

10:06.234 --> 10:09.135
You just put the mail
on the marble table, thank you.

10:10.472 --> 10:11.933
We're friends.

10:12.035 --> 10:13.636
Yo, Cecily!

10:13.739 --> 10:15.305
Yo, Gwen.

10:15.407 --> 10:18.449
I know you got my starter
and my fuel injector.

10:18.551 --> 10:20.544
-I don't, no, not yet.
-That's weird.

10:20.646 --> 10:22.146
Sorry.

10:22.249 --> 10:23.985
I ordered them the fourth
of the last month

10:24.087 --> 10:26.147
and by my algebra, it's been
like three whole weeks.

10:26.249 --> 10:28.157
I'll keep an eye open for it.

10:28.259 --> 10:30.725
Marcus. Marcus!

10:30.827 --> 10:33.230
Wait, you're gonna
want to see this.

10:33.332 --> 10:34.894
-Damn.
-Fuck, Marcus.

10:34.996 --> 10:37.065
-What time is it?

10:37.167 --> 10:39.864
-Sorry, babe. Huh?
-"Sorry, huh" is not a time,
Marcus.

10:39.967 --> 10:41.836
-Yo, are you high?
-Baby, no.

10:41.938 --> 10:44.138
Drinking and driving
is for dummies, honey.

10:44.240 --> 10:46.841
Don't-- There's strangers.
Who's that? What's your name?

10:46.943 --> 10:49.136
-I'm Ranger Finn Wheeler.
- What?

10:49.238 --> 10:51.472
He's a new ranger in town.

10:51.575 --> 10:53.375
-Oh, that's a ranger thing...
-What he say?

10:53.477 --> 10:56.151
-That's that. Y'all both police?
-I'm Cecily.

10:56.254 --> 10:59.916
We've talked many times.
Welcome to Beaverfield.
It's a freak show.

11:02.020 --> 11:03.417
She had too much soda.

11:03.519 --> 11:06.696
-Colorful couple.
-Yeah, quite a show.

11:06.798 --> 11:08.823
-Eh?
- Oh, my goodness,
gracious.

11:08.926 --> 11:11.492
-Proud of it.
-They're in it for a big check
from the pipeline.

11:11.595 --> 11:13.399
It's not funny.
We're just renting here.

11:13.501 --> 11:15.939
-How do you know all this?
- A big bag full of
secrets.

11:16.041 --> 11:18.607
You're not actually insinuating
that you read people's mail?

11:18.709 --> 11:20.410
-No, I'm kidding.
-It's a felony.

11:20.512 --> 11:23.680
You're the new ranger! Hello!

11:23.783 --> 11:27.116
-And who's this?
-Stephen King's very own Trish.

11:27.218 --> 11:29.784
-What? What did you say?
-I said, "Beaverfield's queen
Trish."

11:29.886 --> 11:31.955
Oh, uh-huh.
Hello. Trisha Anderton.

11:32.057 --> 11:34.588
-Proud owner
of Anderton Maple Farms.
-Hey, nice to meet--

11:34.690 --> 11:40.361
It's been in the family
90 years as everybody knows,
but crafting is my passion.

11:40.463 --> 11:42.224
-Boo!
-Oh!

11:42.326 --> 11:44.795
-It's you.

11:44.897 --> 11:48.764
-It's a little pale me.
-Has anybody made you
a soap bottle angel before?

11:48.866 --> 11:51.373
You put it
on your Christmas tree.
You have a Christmas tree?

11:51.475 --> 11:54.604
-Not currently.
-Or do you celebrate Kwanzaa,
put it on your Kwanzaa tree?

11:54.706 --> 11:57.141
-No such thing.
-I am going to open
my own craft store

11:57.243 --> 11:59.041
as soon as that pipeline
comes through.

11:59.143 --> 12:00.041
Just mark them words.

12:00.143 --> 12:03.947
Hello, hello, hello.

12:04.049 --> 12:06.223
One, two, three.

12:06.325 --> 12:09.286
He doesn't get any attention
ever since little Chachi
came into my life.

12:09.388 --> 12:12.123
Look at this.
-Oh!

12:12.225 --> 12:15.231
There she is.
It's Cecily the mailman.

12:15.333 --> 12:17.431
-No, thank you. Stop.
-Ranger Finn Wheeler.
Hey, how are you doing?

12:17.533 --> 12:19.265
Hello, Ranger.

12:19.367 --> 12:21.603
-Cool, never the left.
-Never the left. My kind of guy.

12:21.706 --> 12:23.233
-It's not what he meant.
-

12:23.335 --> 12:24.608
How are you?
- Come on.

12:24.710 --> 12:26.678
Oh, I got something for you,
Ranger.

12:26.780 --> 12:28.972
It's from our own private
reserve right there.

12:29.074 --> 12:31.280
You guys, so many gifts.

12:31.382 --> 12:33.414
The best syrup in Vermont.
Oh, my God, are you kidding
my behind?

12:33.516 --> 12:35.414
What happened?

12:35.516 --> 12:37.946
Jiminy Christmas,
hippies knocked down
our sign again.

12:38.048 --> 12:40.090
Oh. It's Antifa.

12:40.193 --> 12:42.791
I mean look at that.
Great job, Picasso,
you put an X through it.

12:42.893 --> 12:44.486
You're not going to stop
the pipeline.

12:44.588 --> 12:46.127
Do you have this problem
in your last town?

12:47.291 --> 12:48.995
-No.
-Brooklyn hipsters.

12:49.097 --> 12:50.698
Yeah, you just give 'em
a big old knock

12:50.800 --> 12:52.364
on the old craniums, right?

12:52.466 --> 12:55.706
Uh-oh, arrest her, Ranger!
She's the one, lock her up.

12:55.808 --> 12:58.440
Lock her up, yeah, lock her up,
lock her up.

12:58.542 --> 13:00.010
Say goodbye, Chachi.

13:00.112 --> 13:03.939
There's a new sheriff in town.
You're not really a sheriff.

13:04.041 --> 13:05.139
No, you're not.

13:05.241 --> 13:07.475
They seem cool, huh?

13:07.577 --> 13:09.384
He boned Gwen
in their sugaring room.

13:09.486 --> 13:11.213
-No.
-Yes.

13:11.315 --> 13:14.023
That aggressive mechanic lady?

13:15.118 --> 13:16.493
That's the one.

13:16.595 --> 13:19.325
Whew. That's-- That's a dish.

13:22.625 --> 13:24.868
Now this thing,
what exactly is this?

13:24.970 --> 13:29.964
Oh, this? This is Parker's
phallic fire totem.

13:30.066 --> 13:32.804
He's stuck 'cause he needs
a majority town vote
to build it.

13:32.906 --> 13:37.312
Half want the pipeline cash
and half want to save the trees
or whatever.

13:37.414 --> 13:39.816
Anywho, I think
the only holdouts
are Jeanine and the boys.

13:39.919 --> 13:42.117
-Do you need a hand with that?
-Yes, please.

13:44.187 --> 13:48.555
So, you got a big family,
small family, no family?

13:50.654 --> 13:53.591
No, it's just me and my sis.
How about you?

13:53.693 --> 13:56.998
That's so lucky.
No, there's seven of us.
I'm the youngest.

13:57.100 --> 13:58.997
My sister and I were born
the same year.

13:59.099 --> 14:01.434
Irish twins, same grade, even,

14:01.536 --> 14:05.103
so it was like, "You want a toy?
Take it from somebody else."

14:05.205 --> 14:07.544
This is it, right?
You coming with?

14:07.646 --> 14:09.075
Actually, if you wouldn't mind,

14:09.177 --> 14:11.045
you want to just
bring him that package

14:11.148 --> 14:13.243
'cause Flint likes to know
who's around here,

14:13.345 --> 14:15.443
so you could introduce
yourself.

14:15.545 --> 14:17.446
Neighborly fellow,
my kind of guy.

14:17.548 --> 14:19.280
-Thanks for the tip.
-

14:19.382 --> 14:22.554
Hey, oh, just one last--

14:22.656 --> 14:25.086
-Hello, Charlotte, hello?
-You might want to read the--

14:25.188 --> 14:27.423
Hello? Hello?

14:27.525 --> 14:30.795
Charlotte, hello?
I can't--

14:30.897 --> 14:32.734
You're good.

14:32.836 --> 14:36.574
Love, hello, can you hear me?

14:36.676 --> 14:39.042
-Hell-- Ah, crap.
-

14:42.138 --> 14:45.242
Hi, this is Charlotte.
Leave a message, bye.

14:45.344 --> 14:48.244
Hi, Charlotte, it's me,
it's Finn.

14:48.347 --> 14:49.753
Glad I'm finally
getting through.

14:49.855 --> 14:51.551
It's so hard to leave
a voice mail.

14:51.653 --> 14:52.682
It's...

14:54.526 --> 14:56.092
I'll call you back.

14:59.365 --> 15:00.525
Mr. Flint?

15:05.899 --> 15:07.268
Mr. Flint?

15:57.984 --> 16:00.852
Oh! Oh-ho!

16:00.954 --> 16:03.126
Ha! Oh, man.

16:04.296 --> 16:05.425
Oh!

16:07.430 --> 16:10.060
You have 30 seconds to get
the fuck off my property.

16:10.162 --> 16:12.202
I'm Ranger Wheeler.

16:12.304 --> 16:14.831
You're way the hell
out of your jurisdiction,
Ranger.

16:14.933 --> 16:19.142
-You see, I received a complaint
from Dr. Ellis.
-Regarding?

16:19.244 --> 16:23.875
Regarding concerns of possible
commercial trapping.

16:23.977 --> 16:30.179
You can tell Dr. Stalin
I make my living legally
on my own fucking land.

16:30.281 --> 16:32.054
It's called freedom.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.255
As long as you're not doing it
on US forest.

16:34.357 --> 16:38.223
I don't recognize your job,
your stupid uniform,

16:38.325 --> 16:40.489
or the government
you work for.

16:40.591 --> 16:42.325
You're down to 10 seconds,
nine...

16:42.428 --> 16:44.992
-Oh, okay, yeah. Well...
-Seven.

16:45.094 --> 16:47.603
Are you gonna keep counting?
I left a package for you.

16:47.705 --> 16:50.708
Five, four, three.

16:50.810 --> 16:53.737
He's armed!
He's heavily armed!

16:53.839 --> 16:57.940
-Thanks for handling my package.
-Do you know this? Oh!

16:58.042 --> 17:02.380
He's not my kind of guy at all,
which is the neighborly kind.

17:02.482 --> 17:05.285
-Are you hungry?
-Huh? May-- I think.

17:05.388 --> 17:08.283
Yeah, this requires
active measures.
Come on.

17:08.385 --> 17:10.957
-I tried to warn you,
but you were on your phone.
-I was on my phone.

17:19.368 --> 17:21.235
I bring in their packages
in the winter,

17:21.338 --> 17:26.273
so I have full access
to the kitch kingdom.

17:26.376 --> 17:28.202
Whoa.
-Right? It's pretty great.

17:28.304 --> 17:29.372
Awesome.

17:29.475 --> 17:30.912
Do you want to put on
a song?

17:31.014 --> 17:32.545
Oh, yeah, sure, on the jukebox?

17:32.647 --> 17:35.948
Yeah, and I'll see if there's
something I can heat up.

17:36.050 --> 17:37.517
-Okay.
-Okay.

17:42.155 --> 17:43.493
It's a lot of '90s.

17:43.595 --> 17:45.494
Huh?

17:45.596 --> 17:48.594
There's a lot of '90--
I'm just going to put
something on.

17:50.835 --> 17:52.460
-

17:54.439 --> 17:57.766
When you're
Not the one for me?
- Yes.

17:57.868 --> 18:00.270
- I love this song!

18:02.346 --> 18:06.174
And it opened up my eyes

18:06.277 --> 18:11.916
Life is demanding
Without understanding

18:12.018 --> 18:17.590
And it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign

18:21.528 --> 18:24.427
So, what brings you
to Beaverfield?

18:24.529 --> 18:26.764
Hard ball right from the top.

18:26.866 --> 18:30.632
-I had an incident at work.
-Did you touch someone?

18:30.734 --> 18:32.776
-No.
-'Cause time's up, you too.

18:32.878 --> 18:35.437
Yes, but I didn't touch anyone.

18:35.539 --> 18:38.044
-Do you want to show me
on the soap bottle angel?
-It's not about touching.

18:38.146 --> 18:39.610
I'm sorry, yes, go ahead.

18:39.713 --> 18:44.981
Some guys I know
convinced me to fish Grout Pond

18:45.083 --> 18:49.058
without a permit,
and then they posted it
to social media.

18:49.160 --> 18:51.193
-I mean, can you believe it?
-Dummies.

18:51.296 --> 18:53.326
So a transfer was a way for me
to keep my job.

18:53.428 --> 18:54.856
-And Charlotte thought--
-Charlotte?

18:54.958 --> 18:57.193
Yes,
Charlotte, my girlfriend.

18:57.295 --> 19:01.472
She thinks that this situation
could be good for
our relationship.

19:01.574 --> 19:06.970
-How's that?
-Well, you know, she thinks
that I am too "available."

19:07.072 --> 19:09.872
Right, because women
like men who aren't,
ahem, there.

19:09.974 --> 19:12.314
But, you know, I figure I won't
need a whole year.

19:12.416 --> 19:15.010
And maybe, assuming
nobody better comes along...

19:17.085 --> 19:19.480
Your first kombucha?

19:19.582 --> 19:24.258
-Assuming that
nobody better comes along--
-You'll get back together or?

19:24.360 --> 19:26.261
Well, technically,
we're not broken up.

19:26.363 --> 19:28.692
-Ah, but you're not
living together?
-No.

19:28.795 --> 19:31.067
-You're not seeing each other?
-Not currently.

19:31.169 --> 19:33.432
-You're not talking.
-There's texting.

19:33.534 --> 19:36.040
And you're keeping
your options open?

19:36.142 --> 19:39.405
Because Charlotte thinks that--
Oh, my God.

19:39.507 --> 19:42.010
-I'm broken up, aren't I?
-I think so.

19:42.112 --> 19:44.276
Want to do something
violent?

19:44.378 --> 19:46.074
Ah!
- Wow.

19:46.176 --> 19:48.517
I think it's an English axe,
just weighted differently?

19:48.619 --> 19:51.321
-They use the metric system.
-I think that's what it is.

19:55.861 --> 19:57.924
God, that was beautiful.

19:58.026 --> 20:00.595
-I'm being hustled.
-You are. I'm a shark
and this is a long con.

20:00.697 --> 20:03.390
-Clearly. All right.
-Welcome to your worst
nightmare.

20:03.493 --> 20:05.397
All right.

20:05.499 --> 20:07.705
-I'm Ranger Wheeler.
-Hold on.

20:07.807 --> 20:10.868
Before you do anything,
recognize that you're holding
a real murder weapon.

20:10.970 --> 20:13.410
-Yes. Acknowledged.
-And it requires some training.

20:13.512 --> 20:14.537
Yes.

20:14.639 --> 20:17.047
So just try to flip it one time

20:17.149 --> 20:19.316
and then land it
on the second flip.

20:19.418 --> 20:21.810
Just like a flip and then it
lands on the second flip.

20:21.912 --> 20:23.480
-Yeah, okay.
-Does that make sense?

20:23.582 --> 20:24.820
-Yeah. Yeah.
-You got this?

20:24.922 --> 20:26.015
Okay. You got this.

20:28.751 --> 20:30.960
-Oh, yes!
-Oh, yes!

20:31.063 --> 20:32.891
-Up high.
- Yeah!

20:32.993 --> 20:36.760
-Down low. Too slow, oh.
-How did I not see that one
coming?

20:36.862 --> 20:39.099
-Hustler.
-How did you get
into rangering?

20:39.201 --> 20:41.232
-Rangering?
-Yeah.

20:41.334 --> 20:45.199
Yeah, that's what we call it,
but you're going to freak,
but I read that.

20:46.702 --> 20:50.143
-My butt?
-N-No.

20:50.245 --> 20:51.609
-Yeah. Uh-huh.
-Walden?

20:51.711 --> 20:53.312
-Are you serious?
-Yeah, absolutely.

20:53.414 --> 20:55.682
-You poet.
-Yeah, I was 15.

20:55.784 --> 20:58.181
-It changed my life. Yeah?
-Yeah, it changed mine, too.

20:58.284 --> 21:00.918
Bet you've been
to all the biggies, right?
You've been to Sequoia?

21:01.020 --> 21:04.492
-Been to Sequoia,
I've been to Kings Canyon.
-Mm-hmm.

21:04.594 --> 21:07.021
-Been to Yellowstone?
-I've been to Yellowstone.

21:07.123 --> 21:08.692
You know, I camped out
a couple of nights

21:08.794 --> 21:10.432
-in Townshend on the way up.
-Wow.

21:10.534 --> 21:13.137
Yeah. You ever been
to Gallatin National Forest?

21:13.239 --> 21:18.131
No, but I would really
love to go. Yeah.

21:18.234 --> 21:22.938
You know, I feel, um,
most myself outdoors.

21:23.040 --> 21:25.947
-Yeah?
-Yeah. It's a cool life
you have.

21:26.049 --> 21:27.880
Yeah, I guess so.

21:27.982 --> 21:31.916
"A taste for the beautiful is
most cultivated out of doors."

21:33.423 --> 21:34.885
-Walden? Yeah.
-It's Walden. Yeah.

21:34.987 --> 21:38.125
On a mountain

21:38.227 --> 21:41.189
Hey, um, Ranger Finn.

21:42.758 --> 21:45.360
Mailperson Cecily?

21:45.462 --> 21:50.636
I wanna lay
Like this forever...
-Can I kiss you?

21:50.738 --> 21:53.476
-

21:55.971 --> 21:58.908
I'm so sorry. Hello?
Hello?

21:59.010 --> 22:01.045
-I'm so sorry.
-Are you serious right now?

22:01.147 --> 22:05.081
-Hello? Charlotte?
-Are you really answering
a c-- Wow!

22:05.183 --> 22:08.525
Hello? Yeah, hey. Uh-huh, yeah.
I'm sorry.

22:08.627 --> 22:12.792
-Unbelievable.
-Yeah, no.
I'm just shopping.

22:13.999 --> 22:15.364
Grow a pair.

22:15.467 --> 22:18.061
-Yeah, uh. Sorry. Wait, what?

22:20.637 --> 22:23.033
Oh, no, you need
the actual AAA card for that.

22:39.951 --> 22:45.060
Let's go outside
and do our business.

22:45.162 --> 22:48.393
Yes, that's my Chachi.

22:48.495 --> 22:50.864
Yes, you are my good boy.

22:50.966 --> 22:51.997
Yes.

22:52.833 --> 22:56.374
Poo-poo potty, please.
-

23:11.983 --> 23:15.184
-

23:16.028 --> 23:17.461
-

23:19.556 --> 23:20.695
Chachi?

23:27.532 --> 23:28.637
Whoa, boy.

23:30.067 --> 23:33.367
Chachi, what in the heck--?

23:36.874 --> 23:41.419
-

23:52.788 --> 23:54.729
Okay. Come on!

24:12.443 --> 24:17.119
-Mrs. Anderton?
-It's the damn devil
that ate my baby.

24:17.221 --> 24:18.718
Devon found her like this.

24:18.820 --> 24:20.852
I have a triathlon
in August so, you know,

24:20.954 --> 24:22.887
4:00 a.m. sprints,
and I heard screaming.

24:22.989 --> 24:25.152
Well, the whole neighborhood
heard screaming.

24:25.254 --> 24:27.823
I told you.
I didn't need your help.

24:27.926 --> 24:29.233
I'm going to go
get a croissant.

24:29.335 --> 24:34.628
My baby.
That monster killed my Chachi.

24:34.730 --> 24:37.741
I'm so sorry, I'm confused.
Are we talking about
a real baby?

24:37.844 --> 24:40.707
Because if that's the case,
oh, my God, but if not,
it's a dog.

24:40.810 --> 24:42.980
For God's sake, Joaquin,
show a little respect.

24:43.082 --> 24:45.309
It's Joaquim with an M.

24:45.411 --> 24:47.911
I don't mean to be rude, Pete,
but your dog only barked
at Jews.

24:48.013 --> 24:49.649
And brown people,
no carbs for you.

24:49.751 --> 24:53.815
There's something
out there.

24:53.917 --> 24:55.119
Probably just a coyote.

24:58.624 --> 25:00.426
Or a possum, hon.

25:00.528 --> 25:01.731
Those are scary, huh?

25:01.833 --> 25:02.926
No!

25:03.028 --> 25:04.699
I'm so sorry
for your loss, Trish,

25:04.801 --> 25:06.865
but everything in these woods
eats little dogs.

25:06.967 --> 25:08.501
-I can't get on the internet!
-Calm down.

25:08.603 --> 25:10.200
What do you think, Dr. Ellis?

25:15.847 --> 25:17.141
Hi.

25:18.783 --> 25:22.619
Uh, it's a little too early
to tell, Mrs. Sherman,

25:22.721 --> 25:25.454
mainly because I literally
don't know what's going on.

25:25.556 --> 25:29.225
Hi, everyone.
I'm Dr. Ellis, Jane.

25:29.327 --> 25:31.123
I'm here to stop the pipeline.

25:31.225 --> 25:35.566
A prominent environmentalist
who's staying here with us.

25:35.668 --> 25:38.192
-Oh, Dr. Ellis. I got your--
- Oh, my God.

25:38.294 --> 25:40.233
The power's out, like,
everywhere.

25:42.072 --> 25:43.538
Oh, no.

25:43.640 --> 25:46.206
Our poor Chachi
left us this morning.

25:46.308 --> 25:48.238
Come here. Oh.

25:49.348 --> 25:52.080
-Sorry, Trish.
-I'm sorry, too.

25:52.182 --> 25:54.212
Okay, everyone.

25:54.314 --> 25:57.544
I'm gonna go to town and get
the backup generators going,

25:57.646 --> 26:00.114
log Chachi's death,
and get you back
on the internet.

26:00.216 --> 26:01.553
-

26:01.655 --> 26:03.719
Oh, my goodness. What now?

26:03.821 --> 26:04.989
-Jeanine!
-Yeah.

26:05.091 --> 26:07.126
You got to let us in.
Our shitter's broke.

26:07.228 --> 26:11.099
Hey, yo, just so you know that
the streets is all storm-fucked.

26:11.201 --> 26:12.834
Storm-fucked.

26:12.936 --> 26:14.995
-What did she just say?
- I think he said...

26:15.097 --> 26:17.069
-Storm-fucked.
-Yeah.

26:17.934 --> 26:19.767
I'll be right back.

26:33.859 --> 26:34.922
Oh.

27:11.130 --> 27:12.696
Heavens to Betsy.

27:38.619 --> 27:41.219
Heavens to Betsy.

28:02.840 --> 28:04.638
What is...?

28:13.686 --> 28:14.725
Holy sh--!

28:21.196 --> 28:26.102
Ranger, you look like
you just seen a corpse.

28:26.204 --> 28:28.095
You're right.

28:28.197 --> 28:31.601
Uh... the roads are effed.

28:31.703 --> 28:34.534
-Yeah, we just said that.
-Yeah, no shit, dummy.
We said it.

28:34.636 --> 28:37.410
And something's wrong
with the generator.

28:37.512 --> 28:39.415
Which generator?

28:39.517 --> 28:41.481
-All of them.
-Wait, what?

28:41.583 --> 28:46.153
-What does that mean?
-Looks like somebody went
at them with a knife.

28:46.255 --> 28:49.153
-What the hell
do you mean a knife?
-

28:49.255 --> 28:52.056
Is that
what killed my Chachi?

28:52.158 --> 28:54.131
Might we put
the horror leash away?

28:54.233 --> 28:57.491
What kind of animal
is smart enough to go slashing
all the generators,

28:57.593 --> 28:59.297
but stupid enough to eat
your stupid Chachi?

28:59.399 --> 29:01.597
-You're over the line, Wolfson!
-Use your inside voice!

29:01.699 --> 29:04.937
I'll use whatever voice I want!
Maybe I'll use my outside voice!

29:05.039 --> 29:07.142
Okay, well,
if the power grid is out,

29:07.244 --> 29:09.836
it's gonna take
at least a week
for the power to get back up.

29:09.938 --> 29:14.776
-A week?
-Uh, also, there's a dead body
under your porch.

29:20.892 --> 29:24.856
I didn't want
to leave him on the...

29:24.958 --> 29:27.855
So I left him on the table.

29:35.632 --> 29:38.171
Aw, shit.
That's your husband, ain't it?

29:38.273 --> 29:40.341
Didn't get to Belize
after all, huh, Dave?

29:42.813 --> 29:45.472
-Ugh!
-This is definitely a canine.

29:45.574 --> 29:47.778
-How do you know?
-Probably a wolf.

29:47.880 --> 29:50.710
What are you, like,
a wolf detective now, Marcus?
I don't think so.

29:50.812 --> 29:52.889
He's right.
The leg muscles
have been severed.

29:52.991 --> 29:55.185
That's how canine's
immobilize their prey.

29:55.287 --> 29:57.686
Accurate assessment
for a gas man.

29:57.788 --> 30:00.495
Well, I used to do a little
brown bear hunting in Siberia.

30:00.597 --> 30:02.062
It's a beautiful animal.

30:02.164 --> 30:04.668
Yo, lady,
you a wolf detective, though?

30:04.770 --> 30:06.493
Really good, Marcus.
Close, no.

30:06.595 --> 30:08.671
-She studies animals...
-No, thanks.

30:08.773 --> 30:10.664
A teetotaler?
Suit yourself.

30:10.766 --> 30:12.675
Well, I'd-- I'd take some
if you'd be so kind.

30:12.777 --> 30:14.304
- I would be.

30:14.406 --> 30:18.238
What happened to Dave?
It's just so awful.

30:18.340 --> 30:21.015
Anyway, um, lady doctor,

30:21.117 --> 30:24.087
do you think what got Dave
also got my Chachi?

30:24.189 --> 30:26.751
If you'll excuse me,
I need to go compare
these fur samples.

30:26.853 --> 30:28.383
Peter.

30:28.485 --> 30:30.223
He don't stink 'cause
he froze up.

30:30.325 --> 30:32.394
-Maybe we should just
take it inside.
- Yeah.

30:32.496 --> 30:36.361
-That's really disgusting.
- Now one body,
there's two bodies.

30:38.797 --> 30:41.496
Nothing's gonna
get down that mountain
but a snowplow.

30:41.598 --> 30:43.432
Does Beaverfield
have a snowplow?

30:43.534 --> 30:45.833
Fuck, yeah, we do.
- Good.

30:45.935 --> 30:49.079
I just need that starter
and fuel injector I ordered.

30:49.181 --> 30:53.209
Oh.
- Oh, there's
a wild animal out there

30:53.311 --> 30:56.952
and I don't wanna say it
out loud,

30:57.054 --> 31:02.217
but who knows who or when
it's going to kill next?

31:02.319 --> 31:04.420
When she's going to kill next.

31:04.522 --> 31:07.225
-I do not find that funny.
-Hey, hey, hey.

31:07.328 --> 31:09.293
It's a little funny.
-I have an idea.

31:09.396 --> 31:11.799
This Flint guy,
he's an expert hunter, right?

31:11.901 --> 31:13.795
-Oh, yeah.
-You could say that.

31:13.897 --> 31:17.106
-Well, maybe
we pay him a visit--
-Kill the damn thing?

31:17.208 --> 31:21.069
Actually, I was going to say,
maybe h-he could trap it?

31:23.874 --> 31:26.815
You can't go
by yourself, man.
That psycho, he's nuts.

31:26.917 --> 31:29.318
-You could come with me.
-No, I'm good.

31:29.420 --> 31:30.553
Anyone else?

31:30.655 --> 31:32.254
We're trying to have
a baby.

31:32.356 --> 31:35.224
And my husband is dead.
- And Chachi also.

31:35.326 --> 31:36.586
Cecily?

31:39.260 --> 31:41.459
He can probably only
eat one of us at a time.

31:42.993 --> 31:44.935
Uh...

31:45.037 --> 31:47.735
If we had some snowshoes,
we'd be killing this walk.

31:47.837 --> 31:49.599
We get it, you love snowshoes.

31:51.710 --> 31:54.469
Yeah.
Thanks for coming with me.

31:54.571 --> 31:57.773
It's really...
really cool of you.

31:57.875 --> 32:01.250
Cool? Is it cool of me
in like "a friend way
cool of me"?

32:01.352 --> 32:03.945
Or is it cool of me
in like "a girl you almost
make out with,

32:04.048 --> 32:08.291
but then don't because
your ex-girlfriend calls"
cool of me way?

32:08.393 --> 32:11.353
-Look, last night--
-No, Finn, it's fine.
You're not over your ex.

32:11.455 --> 32:12.992
Let's not make
a thing out of it.

32:13.094 --> 32:14.797
Well, no, you're wrong.
You know?

32:14.899 --> 32:19.299
Last night was
very, very big for me.

32:19.401 --> 32:22.103
In like a sad way 'cause
you were with the wrong girl?

32:22.205 --> 32:25.465
No, because I was
with the right girl.

32:25.567 --> 32:28.706
One who's smart and beautiful.

32:28.808 --> 32:29.807
True.

32:29.909 --> 32:31.105
And interesting.

32:31.207 --> 32:32.207
I'm listening.

32:32.309 --> 32:34.979
Look, I blew it, okay?

32:35.081 --> 32:38.118
There's no denying that.

32:38.220 --> 32:41.616
And it's not because
I love Charlotte still.

32:41.719 --> 32:46.788
It's because--
I don't know why.

32:50.301 --> 32:54.735
Finn, you're
a really likable guy,
and that's great.

32:54.837 --> 32:56.701
A lot of people like you.

32:56.803 --> 33:00.710
Not to sound
too heteronormative,
but maybe Charlotte's right.

33:00.812 --> 33:03.043
Maybe you should man up,
you know?

33:03.145 --> 33:04.981
Grow a beard,
hair on your chest,

33:05.083 --> 33:07.576
chug a beer,
yell at someone smaller
than you.

33:07.679 --> 33:09.879
I don't know,
yell things like, "Respect me."

33:09.982 --> 33:12.585
I don't know what men do.
I try not to hang out
with them much.

33:12.687 --> 33:16.156
You do realize that we are
prepared to double the offer?

33:16.258 --> 33:18.328
I don't care
if you triple the offer.

33:18.430 --> 33:22.432
We moved up here for scenery,
not your construction scheme.
No.

33:22.534 --> 33:25.993
And scenery
requires having a forest,
which you don't F up.

33:26.095 --> 33:28.739
Well, you're really
effing up our people's dreams.

33:28.841 --> 33:30.833
Yeah, well,
too bad, Pete.

33:30.935 --> 33:33.703
Shit, I guess Trish
don't get her craft store, huh?

33:33.805 --> 33:36.836
Craft store?
What about our freaking
money?

33:36.938 --> 33:38.882
I don't know.
- Go ask. Ask.

33:38.984 --> 33:43.916
Yo, P-Parker, so Gwen and I,
we want money.

33:44.018 --> 33:48.057
Oh, sorry, Marcus,
if the vote ain't unanimous,
no one gets nothing,

33:48.159 --> 33:50.950
unless you can convince
your neighbors otherwise.

33:51.052 --> 33:54.062
Are you deaf?
We are not going to sell.

33:54.164 --> 33:55.888
-Sorry, neighbors.
- You both suck.

33:55.991 --> 33:57.730
I suck?
- You don't belong here!

33:59.828 --> 34:01.397
You're liberal
snowflakes.

34:01.499 --> 34:03.172
Y'all city slickers suck.

34:04.742 --> 34:07.570
-Yeah.

34:07.672 --> 34:10.904
You got everything
you, um, need, Doctor?

34:11.006 --> 34:15.147
Dr. Ellis-- do I call you Doctor
or Dr. Jane or...?

34:15.249 --> 34:17.152
Jeanine,
I have everything I need.

34:17.254 --> 34:19.146
Thank you so much
for letting me set up shop here.

34:19.248 --> 34:20.815
Okay.

34:20.917 --> 34:24.092
-You got enough power?
-Yep. I work in the woods.

34:24.194 --> 34:27.592
-I've got some batteries.
-Okay, okay. Oh.

34:28.699 --> 34:30.628
-Jeanine?
-Okay.

34:32.897 --> 34:35.305
I'm going to find out
what killed your dead husband.

34:35.407 --> 34:38.473
I have excellent samples,
and I'm going to get answers
for you.

34:38.576 --> 34:40.740
Uh, okay.

35:00.792 --> 35:03.463
-Do you want me to knock or...?
-No, I got it.

35:08.036 --> 35:09.599
-Are you scared?
-No.

35:09.701 --> 35:11.466
-'Cause I can hear your tummy.
-I'm not.

35:11.568 --> 35:14.309
-Are you?
-No, I'm punk.

35:15.874 --> 35:18.040
-You're in a punk band?
-I was in high school, yeah.

35:18.143 --> 35:20.642
We were called Megalodons
'cause our lead singer's name
was Meg.

35:20.744 --> 35:22.416
-That's so cool!
-I know. I played--

35:26.287 --> 35:29.519
Either of you care
to illuminate

35:29.621 --> 35:31.854
what the hell happened
to my generator?

35:35.325 --> 35:37.962
Uh, so...

35:38.064 --> 35:40.369
In conclusion,

35:40.471 --> 35:44.968
what we're asking is that
you track this thing down and--

35:45.070 --> 35:46.143
Kill it?

35:54.014 --> 35:56.417
-No.
-Okay.

35:56.519 --> 35:58.747
Thank you for your time.
You've made yourself clear.

35:58.849 --> 36:01.215
We're just going to
get out of your beard.

36:01.317 --> 36:05.355
Mr. Flint, I understand
that you're proud of being
tucked away

36:05.457 --> 36:07.691
in the outskirts of this town,

36:07.793 --> 36:11.829
but, you know, you're still
a part of this town.

36:11.931 --> 36:14.896
This thing is killing people
in the place where you live,

36:14.998 --> 36:17.773
and the people of this town,
everybody's going,

36:17.875 --> 36:20.934
"How the-- How the heck

36:21.036 --> 36:23.547
are we going to get rid
of this monster?"

36:24.316 --> 36:28.179
You know what? Everybody,
every single one of them,

36:28.281 --> 36:29.677
they all voted for you.

36:29.779 --> 36:31.347
-It was really led by you.
-Cecily.

36:31.449 --> 36:33.047
Don't touch that, please.

36:35.522 --> 36:39.255
-Mr. Flint, Emerson.
-Emerson Flint.

36:39.357 --> 36:42.623
People are afraid,
and, you know, no matter
what their differences are,

36:42.725 --> 36:46.102
people deserve to feel safe.

36:46.204 --> 36:49.437
I guess what we're asking
is that you...

36:50.569 --> 36:55.270
you be a good neighbor,
you know?

36:55.372 --> 36:57.077
Like Mr. Rogers.

36:57.179 --> 36:59.310
-Hey, I love him.
-Yeah.

36:59.412 --> 37:02.450
-Mr. Rogers, huh?
-Yeah.

37:05.547 --> 37:06.619
Who's that?

37:07.384 --> 37:08.423
Hmm?

37:09.556 --> 37:12.829
It was all Jeanine's story,
you know,

37:12.931 --> 37:16.761
Dave running off
and whatnot.

37:16.863 --> 37:20.960
Welcome to Beaverfield.
Population: bunch of liars.

37:21.062 --> 37:23.268
What are you suggesting,
Mrs. Anderton?

37:23.371 --> 37:26.065
Pete,
you and Dave were tight.

37:26.168 --> 37:28.637
Did he ever say anything
about going to Belize?

37:28.739 --> 37:30.608
Nope, but you know
what's weird?

37:30.711 --> 37:32.576
Jeanine's against
your pipeline, Mr. Parker,

37:32.678 --> 37:34.444
but Dave was really excited
about it.

37:34.546 --> 37:36.777
Mm-hmm.
-Huh.

37:36.879 --> 37:38.979
Wait, y'all aren't saying
that--

37:39.081 --> 37:41.983
We just don't know
for sure, now, do we?

37:42.085 --> 37:44.455
Shit. You know what
I can't get out of my head?

37:44.557 --> 37:46.519
Language.
-Tell me.

37:46.621 --> 37:50.362
All of the generators
are just conveniently mangled
by some animal?

37:50.464 --> 37:52.259
-Fuck off.
- Language.

37:52.361 --> 37:56.835
Somebody did this,
a legitimately maladjusted
somebody.

37:56.937 --> 37:59.835
Mm, I don't know.
Dr. Ellis did say
it was an animal.

37:59.937 --> 38:02.139
-I mean, there was
all those hairs.
-Mm.

38:02.241 --> 38:06.844
Well, we definitely have
some unknown knowns
and some known unknowns.

38:09.083 --> 38:12.178
What's known is that
animals don't sabotage
generators,

38:12.280 --> 38:16.517
but guess what is covered
in hair and totally can?

38:19.959 --> 38:22.799
No. No. Again, I wasn't--
I wasn't going to say that.

38:22.901 --> 38:24.334
I was going to say...

38:26.166 --> 38:27.766
Emerson Flint.

38:28.902 --> 38:31.201
"It's a Beautiful Day
in the Neighborhood"?

38:31.303 --> 38:32.538
King Friday?

38:32.641 --> 38:34.639
He's a man that plays
with puppets, you know?

38:34.742 --> 38:36.973
-The land of make-believe?
-I don't think so.

38:38.916 --> 38:42.376
Mr. Flint, I'm convinced
this thing is going to kill
again, and--

38:42.478 --> 38:43.518
Finn.

38:47.825 --> 38:49.686
Chachi.

38:49.788 --> 38:52.224
-Oh, my God.
- I know, I know.

38:52.326 --> 38:54.929
I'm not your man. Get out.

38:55.031 --> 38:56.831
Understood. Uh...

38:56.933 --> 39:00.100
We're probably
just going to head back
to the Inn, save some lives.

39:00.202 --> 39:01.831
-Make a soup.
-Mm-hmm.

39:01.934 --> 39:03.737
I'd die for one
of Jeanine's sandwiches.

39:03.839 --> 39:05.671
I don't want to die.
-I don't want to die either.

39:05.773 --> 39:07.771
-That would be terrible.
-Good night.

39:07.873 --> 39:10.608
Oh, gosh.
-We have to just push.

39:10.710 --> 39:13.279
-Is it jammed?
-You want to leave?

39:13.382 --> 39:18.178
-Uh...
-It's fine.

39:18.280 --> 39:20.189
It's not opening.
I'm going in both directions.

39:20.291 --> 39:22.224
You go ahead, please.
Don't. Spare me.

39:22.326 --> 39:23.690
Oh, please don't.
Oh, please!

39:26.389 --> 39:28.130
-Please don't
bother with the lock.
-Spare me .

39:28.232 --> 39:29.361
I couldn't do that
myself?

39:29.464 --> 39:30.800
I could have gotten that
myself.

39:30.902 --> 39:32.965
But I appreciate it.

39:33.068 --> 39:34.998
-He's definitely the murderer.
-Keep your voice down,
be normal.

39:43.478 --> 39:46.448
-Hurry! Get warm.
-What happened?

39:46.550 --> 39:48.817
What did he say?
-Emerson killed Chachi.

39:48.919 --> 39:50.950
What?

39:51.053 --> 39:53.283
Hold on a minute.
We don't know that for sure,
Cecily.

39:53.385 --> 39:56.618
Does that mean he killed Dave?
Does that mean he killed
my husband?

39:56.720 --> 39:58.391
He had Chachi's collar.

39:58.493 --> 40:00.897
-She does this a lot.

40:00.999 --> 40:03.730
That's the collar.

40:04.661 --> 40:09.803
That bastard man.

40:09.905 --> 40:13.071
-Okay, okay! Shh!
It's all right. It's all right.
-Peter!

40:13.174 --> 40:15.836
She's just happy
to have some closure,
and now we finally got it.

40:15.939 --> 40:18.274
-It's Emerson.
-

40:18.376 --> 40:21.410
-Chachi just got his wings.
Dave, too.
- Sorry, Trish.

40:21.512 --> 40:23.678
Hey, Jeanine, what do you say
we open up a nice bottle
of wine, huh?

40:23.780 --> 40:25.120
-No!
- Okay.

40:25.222 --> 40:26.852
Oh! Uh-- Uh, okay.

40:26.954 --> 40:29.490
-Well, maybe not that one, Pete.
-You want some, Gwen.

40:29.592 --> 40:31.627
You're not one to turn away
a spicy red.

40:31.729 --> 40:34.289
Why you fuckin'
touch my ass?!
- Whoa, okay.

40:34.391 --> 40:36.122
Keep your hands to yourself,
or I'll cut them off.

40:36.224 --> 40:37.332
Must be
that time of the month.

40:37.434 --> 40:38.532
Don't touch
my wife's ass.

40:38.634 --> 40:39.863
Can I make anybody
a sandwich?

40:39.966 --> 40:41.267
I'll take one.
- No, you won't.

40:41.369 --> 40:42.769
Me, I want one.

41:03.622 --> 41:05.185
-Oh, my God,

41:05.288 --> 41:08.459
that was an absolutely
horrible sound you made.

41:08.561 --> 41:11.026
Dr. Ellis, are you okay?

41:11.129 --> 41:14.633
Did you find the answers now?
That was fast.

41:14.735 --> 41:17.166
I compared the DNA
samples.

41:19.509 --> 41:21.475
The hairs from both
Dave's body

41:21.577 --> 41:24.479
and Chachi's little outfit
are a match.

41:24.582 --> 41:26.846
Everything about this predator
is unorthodox.

41:29.614 --> 41:30.718
It's not human.

41:32.580 --> 41:34.854
It's canine, but there are
no matches in the database.

41:34.956 --> 41:37.485
I'm going to keep
running tests, but for now,

41:37.587 --> 41:49.964
what I can tell you
is I don't know what
this thing is.
