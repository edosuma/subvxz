'The spirit of a man will sustain him in
sickness, but who can bear a broken spirit?'

If these exercises are helping
you in any way please let me know.

18:05.230 --> 18:07.330
I'd love to hear from you. And.

18:07.380 --> 18:11.340
Just press on. Stay safe.

18:11.390 --> 18:15.070
And remember that while we're trying to better
ourselves there are forces at work that-

18:15.120 --> 18:17.730
-want to keep us in the dark. And in pain.

18:17.780 --> 18:21.150
So be optimistic. But be prepared.

I'll take a look around. If I see
anything suspicious I'll call the police.

And then I'll call you back.

It'll do the full scan first but if that
doesn't work then do the deep scan.

That one takes forever, but you'll
start seeing the stuff on the card.

be able to see the previews of them soon.

23:56.610 --> 24:00.330
Yeah. And for my services
I expect to see what's on it.

and I would like to see the rest.

of my job you're interested in.

26:43.480 --> 26:46.870
Hey guys. So today I do
have another exercise for you.

26:46.920 --> 26:49.670
But I also wanted to show
you something a little different.

26:49.720 --> 26:52.900
But it's very important. It could
really help you with your healing.

26:52.950 --> 26:55.150
And especially your
deliverance if you need it.

26:55.200 --> 26:58.950
So, this is one of three monuments
that've been out here for years.

26:59.000 --> 27:03.590
In very remote areas of the Green Mountain
Forest. Not the park, but the forest.

27:03.640 --> 27:07.670
To get to this one you would have to find the
first fork in the path off the green trail.

27:07.720 --> 27:10.950
Make a right at the first oak you
see. And then just keep going straight-

27:11.000 --> 27:16.510
-until you find another dirt
path that'll bring you here.

27:16.560 --> 27:21.330
So, this is a cairn. Sometimes
they're burial mounds, this one's not.

27:21.380 --> 27:25.710
It's for balance. To counteract
the negative energies in an area.

27:25.760 --> 27:30.780
There are negative spirits and negative
energies that shift the whole vibe of a place.

27:30.830 --> 27:34.800
So, houses, forests, towns.

27:34.850 --> 27:39.150
It's the reason why you get an icky
feeling sometimes just entering an area.

27:43.850 --> 27:46.200
These woods have a pretty dark history.

27:46.250 --> 27:48.670
Cult activity. Actual devil worship.

27:48.720 --> 27:52.210
And it runs throughout the
county so it has a really strong pull.

27:52.260 --> 27:54.210

to try and temper that.

leftovers so if you want to join, you can.

1:02:12.920 --> 1:02:14.990
Uh, no. Um.

1:02:16.040 --> 1:02:18.600
Actually, I was going to
say I didn't want to intrude.

1:02:18.650 --> 1:02:21.770
But after today, I'd rather
not be home alone, so.

1:02:23.620 --> 1:02:24.750
Alone?

1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:26.550
Where are your folks?

1:02:28.300 --> 1:02:29.940
Rebecca: Boyfriend?

1:02:30.870 --> 1:02:31.840
Roommate?

1:02:32.690 --> 1:02:34.560
Uh.. um.

1:02:34.610 --> 1:02:36.380
My parents... um.

1:02:36.430 --> 1:02:39.840
My parents are dead. And I
live in an apartment. Alone.

1:02:39.890 --> 1:02:42.870
And no boyfriend. Not... not now, anyways.

1:02:46.320 --> 1:02:48.480
Well, dinner at my house it is, then.

1:03:08.730 --> 1:03:11.020
Rebecca: We pray before
we eat. You don't have to, but-

1:03:11.070 --> 1:03:12.050
No, that's fine.

1:03:14.400 --> 1:03:17.140
Thank you, Lord, for this food.

1:03:17.190 --> 1:03:20.740
Rebecca: Thank you for this
day and for our guest, tonight.

1:03:20.790 --> 1:03:23.800
Please bless this meal in Jesus' name.

1:03:23.850 --> 1:03:25.350
Rebecca: Amen. >>Amen.

1:03:31.280 --> 1:03:33.320
Raegan: So, I'm probably
not supposed to ask.

1:03:33.370 --> 1:03:37.940
But considering Becca never brings
her clients over I'm guessing it's okay.

1:03:37.990 --> 1:03:39.570
You did the Grave Challenge?

1:03:39.620 --> 1:03:40.610
Yeah.

1:03:41.260 --> 1:03:45.110
And you really think there's
something dangerous about it?

1:03:45.160 --> 1:03:49.450
Raegan: So what do you think
it is? The music? The dance?

1:03:49.500 --> 1:03:50.480
Or...

1:03:50.530 --> 1:03:52.560
Or maybe it's just TikTok itself.

1:03:52.610 --> 1:03:53.890
How so?

1:03:53.940 --> 1:03:57.600
Rebecca: Obviously TikTok was created
to make kids dumber than they already are.

1:03:57.650 --> 1:04:00.060
This one just happens to be worse somehow.

1:04:00.110 --> 1:04:03.950
Rebecca: It's true. If you spend more
than 20 minutes with someone under the age-

1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:07.130
-of 25. At some point they'll
spontaneously break into some-

1:04:07.180 --> 1:04:11.520
-ridiculous, terribly choreographed dance. And
it's so random. It's like they can't help it.

1:04:11.570 --> 1:04:13.320
They have spasms. It's like.

1:04:17.470 --> 1:04:19.350
[ Harper and Raegan giggling ]

1:04:19.400 --> 1:04:22.480
[ Rebecca laughs ] It's so
random. And it's so dumb.

1:04:22.530 --> 1:04:26.210
Rebecca: I just want to make sure you guys know
what it's like for anyone with half a brain.

1:04:33.890 --> 1:04:35.210
You okay?

1:04:35.260 --> 1:04:37.430
Harper: Yeah, um. Just excuse me a minute.

1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:46.980
Raegan: She's really that upset
about you being a jerk to TikTok?

1:04:47.030 --> 1:04:49.570
No, she just had kind of a stressful day.

1:04:49.620 --> 1:04:50.810
Oh.

1:04:51.560 --> 1:04:53.370
What did you say her last name was?

1:04:54.120 --> 1:04:57.100
Um... Grace. Why?

1:04:57.150 --> 1:05:01.530
She looks kind of familiar. Just wondering
if I saw one of her videos before.

1:05:02.780 --> 1:05:04.450
Did something happen to her?

1:05:04.500 --> 1:05:06.590
Rebecca: I don't really
know. I didn't really ask her.

1:05:06.640 --> 1:05:10.800
I just kind of assumed she had some
paranormal experiences like the others.

1:05:10.850 --> 1:05:13.310
You didn't do homework
on one of your clients.

1:05:13.360 --> 1:05:16.170
Raegan: You're slipping.
She's a young girl.

1:05:16.220 --> 1:05:19.570
I only look them up to make sure
they're not some creepy sex offender.

1:05:19.620 --> 1:05:22.920
Hey pervs come in all sizes
and you should know that.

1:05:22.970 --> 1:05:25.580
You brought her home to
me. And made me cook for her?

1:05:25.630 --> 1:05:26.900
[ Rebecca scoffs ]

1:05:26.950 --> 1:05:28.150
You're the worst.

[ gentle, emotional music ]

1:05:34.000 --> 1:05:35.780
You okay? >>Yeah, sorry.

1:05:35.830 --> 1:05:38.320
Um, it's just been a while
since I've had a good laugh.

1:05:40.370 --> 1:05:42.560
How long has it been
since you had a good drink?

1:05:42.610 --> 1:05:47.050
I'm 19. My Dad let me have a Malibu
Bay Breeze at a wedding last year.

1:05:47.100 --> 1:05:51.310
That's a good choice. But I've
got something for you to try.

1:05:51.360 --> 1:05:52.460
Hm?

1:06:01.000 --> 1:06:04.600
Alright, it looks like just a few more
hours before we get to watch the last two.

1:06:04.650 --> 1:06:06.130
That'll be around midnight.

1:06:06.180 --> 1:06:10.140
Yeah. Can't promise I'll be awake by then but
we can check it out first thing in the morning.

1:06:10.190 --> 1:06:11.600
What time do you want me here?

1:06:11.650 --> 1:06:13.930
Just stay the night. It's easier that way.

1:06:13.980 --> 1:06:15.720
I don't have clothes or anything.

1:06:15.770 --> 1:06:19.190
Don't be such a princess. You
can go home in the morning.

1:06:19.240 --> 1:06:22.040
Plus, there's no reason to leave,
especially after you've had a drink.

1:06:23.100 --> 1:06:25.820
This was part of your plan, wasn't it?

1:06:25.870 --> 1:06:29.130
Maybe. But why go home and
be alone if you don't have to?

1:06:31.080 --> 1:06:32.160
Raegan won't mind?

1:06:32.210 --> 1:06:34.800
Rebecca: No. I told her it was possible.

1:06:34.850 --> 1:06:38.920
Plus, you know teenagers.
They could care less. Just relax.

1:06:38.970 --> 1:06:42.340
Speaking of teenagers I don't mean to
assume to know where your parents are but,

1:06:42.390 --> 1:06:45.420
I think it's really cool of you.
Raising your sister on your own.

1:06:46.470 --> 1:06:47.950
Yeah.

1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:50.510
It's been a challenge, though.

1:06:50.560 --> 1:06:54.300
Rebecca: She's had some
health issues, mental and physical.

1:06:54.350 --> 1:06:57.380
Which of course, losing a
parent, would do to... well.

1:06:57.430 --> 1:06:59.340
Anyone. Including me.

1:07:02.390 --> 1:07:04.350
I'm sorry about your parents.

1:07:06.600 --> 1:07:09.880
Mine died in a plain
crash. About four years ago.

1:07:12.690 --> 1:07:17.420
Um. My mom died giving birth to
me. And my Dad died last month.

1:07:17.470 --> 1:07:20.630
Harper: Cancer. They caught
it in the advanced stages.

1:07:20.680 --> 1:07:21.950
A month ago?

1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:25.350
Harper, I'm so sorry.

1:07:25.400 --> 1:07:28.510
It's not the only loss
I've experienced. But um.

1:07:28.560 --> 1:07:30.210
It's definitely hit the hardest.

1:07:32.560 --> 1:07:35.840
You know, I would've
really like an older sister.

1:07:35.890 --> 1:07:39.500
Even a little one, but...
I was an only child. So.

1:07:39.550 --> 1:07:42.220
I think Raegan really,
really appreciates you.

1:07:43.270 --> 1:07:46.050
Yeah, she respects me.

1:07:46.100 --> 1:07:49.070
She knows I love her and
I want what's best for her.

1:07:49.120 --> 1:07:52.510
As much as she needs me. I need her, too.

1:07:55.160 --> 1:07:58.610
And hey, Raegan's right. I don't
usually get close to my clients, but-

1:07:58.660 --> 1:08:00.980
-something told me to
make an exception for you.

1:08:01.030 --> 1:08:03.290
So, we're here for you.

Alright. You change your mind in the
next 10 minutes, you can just knock.

died. And some of your friends did.

you uploaded that challenge, right?

got her involved so now you just put us all in danger.

1:23:18.900 --> 1:23:22.250

1:23:28.950 --> 1:23:32.920
Harper: And you can also do it through
various rituals like offerings of rum.

Things to do with fire. Peppers.

1:23:40.550 --> 1:23:43.170
And you can also do it through dance.

1:23:43.220 --> 1:23:48.350
That's why dance is involved in
so many native and Voodoo rituals.

1:23:48.400 --> 1:23:52.390
Harper: Because they're calling the
loa, the Voodoo spirits, to come to them.

1:23:52.440 --> 1:23:54.630
And possess them.

1:23:54.680 --> 1:23:58.680

be a bad time to start praying, right?

decisions. It's not like He has to save her.
