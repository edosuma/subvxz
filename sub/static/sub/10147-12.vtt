01:12.490 --> 01:14.158
You warm enough, hon?

01:14.242 --> 01:16.410
Sam, I'm never cold. You know that.

01:16.494 --> 01:18.788
My warm-blooded wife.

01:18.871 --> 01:22.250
I heard the DA's office
is plea-bargaining the Densmore case.

01:22.333 --> 01:24.293
Do you know how hard my men worked to...

01:24.377 --> 01:27.171
Uh-uh-uh, no shoptalk after hours.

01:27.255 --> 01:30.007
You want to discuss my shortcomings
as a DA,

01:30.091 --> 01:32.927
call my office and make
an appointment, Commissioner.

01:37.974 --> 01:39.892
Did you hear...

01:46.315 --> 01:47.566
- Sam, get back.
{933931

02:10.548 --> 02:11.882
This way.

02:14.176 --> 02:15.803
Officer under attack. Shots fired.

02:15.886 --> 02:18.055
Gotham Park, Central Drive.
Repeat, Gotham Park.

03:02.224 --> 03:03.225
Gotcha.

03:17.031 --> 03:18.866
I gotta get me one of those swords.

03:20.368 --> 03:21.619
<i>This</i> is the <i>police.</i>

03:21.702 --> 03:23.788
<i>Put your weapon down and step back.</i>

03:27.291 --> 03:29.001
<i>This is your last warning.</i>

03:29.085 --> 03:31.003
<i>Put your weapon down now.</i>

03:31.587 --> 03:32.588
Whoa!

03:38.344 --> 03:39.595
Forget Batman. Stop the woman.

04:11.001 --> 04:13.671
- Are you all right, hon?
- Yeah, fine.

04:13.754 --> 04:14.755
Just fine.

04:19.635 --> 04:21.470
That's her. Kind of blurry.

04:21.554 --> 04:23.764
It's the only photo INTERPOL has.

04:23.848 --> 04:26.434
It was taken at the airport
assassination in Berlin.

04:26.517 --> 04:28.602
- Who is she?
- Curaré.

04:28.686 --> 04:30.604
She's as lethal as her name.

04:30.688 --> 04:32.982
A member of The Society Of Assassins.

04:33.065 --> 04:35.067
No one knows her original name anymore,

04:35.151 --> 04:36.193
or her face.

04:36.277 --> 04:37.862
What about the sword?

04:37.945 --> 04:39.238
A scimitar.

04:39.321 --> 04:42.366
Sharpened by lasers to an edge
no thicker than a molecule.

04:42.450 --> 04:44.302
Guess you'll want me to keep an eye
on the commissioner.

04:44.326 --> 04:46.787
No, Barbara Gordon's not the target.

04:46.871 --> 04:48.414
Her husband is.

04:53.294 --> 04:55.754
How did she... Man, what do we do?

04:55.838 --> 04:58.466
- Hello, Barbara.
- Long time, Bruce.

04:58.549 --> 05:00.885
- How's Sam?
- Holding up.

05:00.968 --> 05:04.388
He's scheduled to testify Wednesday
at the trial of Fyodor Davich,

05:04.472 --> 05:06.140
the international arms dealer.

05:06.223 --> 05:08.559
Without the testimony, Davich will walk.

05:08.642 --> 05:11.854
So he's arranged for my husband
to be hit before the deposition.

05:13.147 --> 05:15.232
I see you've sewed up the bullet holes.

05:15.983 --> 05:18.027
You're Batgirl. She's Batgirl.

05:18.110 --> 05:19.653
Was Batgirl.

05:19.737 --> 05:22.656
That brand of costume justice went out
with the tommy gun, kid.

05:22.740 --> 05:24.492
I appreciate what you did tonight,

05:24.575 --> 05:27.119
but I want you to stay out
of police business.

05:27.203 --> 05:29.830
Of course, maybe I'm talking
to the wrong guy.

05:30.956 --> 05:34.043
Hard to believe you're still remaking
your image at this late date.

05:34.126 --> 05:36.378
- I never forced him.
- It's what I wanted.

05:37.087 --> 05:39.215
That's what we all thought
at the beginning.

05:40.132 --> 05:41.884
I've looked the other way so far,

05:41.967 --> 05:43.177
but I'm not my father.

05:43.260 --> 05:45.387
I don't want to have to come
back here again. <i>Capisce?</i>

05:48.390 --> 05:51.852
Does this mean you won't be wanting
the information I have on Curaré?

06:00.986 --> 06:03.739
I mean it, Bruce. Stay out of it.

06:24.885 --> 06:27.805
<i>You were taught
to expect the unexpected, Curaré.</i>

06:27.888 --> 06:31.475
<i>Batman should not have made
a difference nor the police.</i>

06:31.559 --> 06:33.978
<i>No matter how many there were.</i>

06:34.061 --> 06:36.063
<i>You know the price of failure.</i>

06:37.064 --> 06:39.024
<i>I only hope you haven't lost your edge.</i>

07:12.933 --> 07:15.060
Checkpoint 2, everything okay?

07:15.144 --> 07:17.646
<i>Perimeters are all secure,
ma 'am. Tight as a coffin.</i>

07:17.730 --> 07:19.064
That's reassuring.

07:19.148 --> 07:20.190
Don't worry, <i>Sam.</i>

07:20.274 --> 07:22.818
I won't let anyone get
within 100 yards of you.

07:23.569 --> 07:26.322
I thought the man was supposed
to protect the woman.

07:26.405 --> 07:27.906
Last century, babe.

07:28.907 --> 07:30.326
Your car's ready, commissioner.

07:30.409 --> 07:33.495
Just do what I told you to,
and it will all be fine.

07:45.591 --> 07:46.842
I'm telling you, Bruce,

07:46.925 --> 07:49.178
the president should have
this much protection.

07:52.681 --> 07:54.433
Hey, she's leaving.

07:54.516 --> 07:55.851
<i>Who?</i>

07:55.934 --> 07:56.977
<i>Barbara Gordon.</i>

07:57.061 --> 07:58.854
She's got to know
Curare's going to be there.

08:08.947 --> 08:11.116
Nobody'd be crazy enough
to take on all these...

08:14.703 --> 08:15.704
Hello.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.249
- It came from over here.
- Where's Jack?

09:17.141 --> 09:19.601
Checkpoint 1, how close is she? Come in.

10:33.926 --> 10:34.927
Look out!

10:40.390 --> 10:41.390
A fake.

10:59.952 --> 11:01.370
Upstairs, quickly.

11:30.566 --> 11:32.234
Hold your fire.

11:34.111 --> 11:35.404
She's gone.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.593
Got it, Commissioner.
I'm taking him there now.

11:57.676 --> 11:59.553
- Is there a problem?
- She got away.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.530
It wasn't me who set off the alarm.

12:18.614 --> 12:19.656
I did the best I could.

12:19.740 --> 12:21.408
This is the last warning you get.

12:21.491 --> 12:24.828
If I see so much as a pointy-eared
shadow anywhere near police business,

12:24.912 --> 12:26.705
I'II drag you and Bruce to jail.

12:26.788 --> 12:27.956
You've got me?

12:31.043 --> 12:32.336
Why do you hate him so much?

12:34.004 --> 12:35.422
Ancient history, McGinnis.

12:35.505 --> 12:37.382
History's my favorite subject.

12:46.516 --> 12:49.478
So, you and Dick Grayson, like, dated?

12:51.355 --> 12:53.315
In college. Puppy love.

12:53.774 --> 12:56.109
Later on, we just never talked about it.

12:56.193 --> 12:57.527
People should communicate more.

12:58.695 --> 13:01.782
Dick finally got fed up
living in Batman's shadow.

13:01.865 --> 13:03.659
He decided to leave.

13:03.742 --> 13:06.745
He was hurt when I chose
to stay behind with Bruce.

13:06.828 --> 13:08.163
As his partner.

13:10.415 --> 13:11.415
His girlfriend?

13:14.002 --> 13:15.170
Whoa.

13:15.253 --> 13:17.798
On the street, it was like ballet.

13:17.881 --> 13:20.175
We were the perfect duo.

13:20.258 --> 13:22.719
But for Bruce, Batman,

13:22.803 --> 13:24.346
there was nothing but the street.

13:24.429 --> 13:27.182
Eventually, that gets old.

13:27.265 --> 13:29.351
Time comes when you gotta
hang up the cape.

13:29.977 --> 13:31.979
But Bruce wouldn't.

13:32.062 --> 13:33.438
Or couldn't.

13:33.522 --> 13:36.108
So I left and never looked back.

13:37.275 --> 13:38.527
No, I don't hate him.

13:38.610 --> 13:40.862
I hate what he's become.

13:40.946 --> 13:43.699
Such a great man, so alone.

13:45.867 --> 13:47.369
Coffee's on me, kid.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.922
My husband gives his deposition
tomorrow at 7:00.

13:59.006 --> 14:02.092
We'll be escorting him back
into Gotham on the 6:15 Metro.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.927
<i>I want SWAT mobilized,</i>

14:04.011 --> 14:06.263
<i>but keep the details
on a need-to-know basis.</i>

14:06.346 --> 14:08.724
<i>The fewer people who know about this,
the better.</i>

14:16.523 --> 14:18.567
The 6:15 Metro takes
the most direct route

14:18.650 --> 14:20.277
and makes the fewest stops.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.737
Good for security.

14:21.820 --> 14:23.530
I'm betting Sam will be on that one.

14:23.613 --> 14:25.675
There are several points
where you could jump aboard.

14:25.699 --> 14:27.617
<i>Yeah, on my one-way mp back to “Me.</i>

14:27.701 --> 14:30.287
I'm figuring your best bet
would be this juncture.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.664
Come on. I told you
what the commish said.

14:32.748 --> 14:34.041
What are you trying to prove?

14:34.124 --> 14:35.876
I'm just trying to protect her.

14:35.959 --> 14:37.919
- It's what I do.
- Okay.

14:38.503 --> 14:39.713
But this is Gordon's collar.

14:39.796 --> 14:41.715
I like her, Bruce. I respect her.

14:41.798 --> 14:43.717
I'm not gonna cross her.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.320
Do you know what happens when a member

14:45.385 --> 14:48.638
of The Society Of Assassins
fails to kill his target?

14:48.722 --> 14:50.557
He becomes the target.

14:50.640 --> 14:51.808
You mean they kill their own?

14:51.892 --> 14:53.727
Except they've never had to.

14:53.810 --> 14:56.146
Not one of them has ever failed.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.940
And Curare is the best they have.

15:10.368 --> 15:13.371
In half an hour, it'll all be over.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.166
Do I look worried?

16:10.387 --> 16:11.721
Sanchez!

16:32.784 --> 16:35.078
<i>Sentry 1, report. Sentry 1.</i>

17:17.204 --> 17:19.122
We're in deep trouble, aren't we, hon?

17:19.206 --> 17:21.291
We've got ten inches of steel
to hold her off.

17:23.627 --> 17:25.170
Officer in need of assistance.

17:25.253 --> 17:26.296
Anyone, respond.

17:28.632 --> 17:29.716
So much for help.

18:40.578 --> 18:41.830
Look out!

18:45.500 --> 18:46.501
Down!

19:40.764 --> 19:43.016
I guess you never lose the touch.

19:43.099 --> 19:45.060
- How'd it feel?
- Like old times.

19:46.269 --> 19:48.188
You better go.
It wouldn't look good if...

19:49.814 --> 19:51.107
Like old times, all right.

19:53.068 --> 19:56.154
I hear that Sam's deposition
is sure to convict Davich.

19:56.738 --> 19:58.156
<i>Barbara must be pleased.</i>

19:58.239 --> 19:59.532
You should've seen her, Bruce.

19:59.616 --> 20:01.326
She sure swings a mean Batarang.

20:01.409 --> 20:03.661
- She always did.
<i>- Hold</i> on.

20:04.079 --> 20:07.040
<i>The unnamed woman believed
to be a hired assassin</i>

20:07.123 --> 20:08.833
<i>escaped from police custody.</i>

20:08.917 --> 20:11.419
<i>- Her whereabouts are unknown.</i>

20:11.503 --> 20:13.338
- Did you hear that?
<i>- It's</i> all <i>right.</i>

20:13.421 --> 20:16.007
<i>Curaré won't be going after Sam anymore.</i>

20:16.716 --> 20:18.343
<i>She has other concerns now.</i>
