<i>Previously on The Fosters:</i>

00:01.991 --> 00:03.575
- [Wyatt] We should get on the road.
- [Callie] What's the hurry?

00:03.609 --> 00:05.410
I'm going to go gas up the car.

00:05.444 --> 00:07.395
You meet me down there as soon as you can.

00:07.413 --> 00:08.562
Zachary!

00:08.581 --> 00:09.664
- Who is that?
- Get in the car!

00:09.698 --> 00:12.667
- My mom. I'm sorry.
- Right now! Now!

00:12.701 --> 00:14.602
- Well, now you know.
- Know what?

00:14.637 --> 00:17.455
- How weird my mom is.
- Ok, yeah, she's a little kooky.

00:17.506 --> 00:18.606
But so what.

00:18.641 --> 00:20.341
I know that you were at school

00:20.376 --> 00:23.344
the night of my photo
shoot, making fake IDs.

00:23.379 --> 00:25.579
I guess one of the fakes got
confiscated last night at a bar.

00:25.598 --> 00:28.249
Don't worry, I'll get you your money back.

00:28.267 --> 00:29.550
What if I moved in?

00:29.584 --> 00:33.554
Maybe when he moves back to his
mom's, we can revisit the idea.

00:33.589 --> 00:34.722
So what did you do with the money?

00:34.756 --> 00:37.425
I mean, since you didn't give it to Callie.

00:37.459 --> 00:38.610
They really want me to testify,

00:38.644 --> 00:41.696
and I... I'm scared they're
going to cut off my food stamps.

00:41.730 --> 00:44.265
Maybe I can help you.

00:50.472 --> 00:52.290
You're telling people our IDs don't work?

00:52.324 --> 00:53.458
I changed my mind.

00:53.492 --> 00:55.410
Well, now I'm going to return the favor.

[playing classical melody]

01:20.319 --> 01:22.270
That was amazing.

01:22.304 --> 01:24.656
Yeah. Except, I can't keep the triplets

01:24.690 --> 01:27.275
in time with the eighth notes,
and I keep missing the sharps.

01:27.309 --> 01:30.445
Well, yeah, there's that,
but, um, otherwise...

01:30.479 --> 01:31.646
[chuckles]

01:31.680 --> 01:35.450
I have an audition for the
San Diego Junior Symphony.

01:35.484 --> 01:36.534
How did that happen?

01:36.585 --> 01:38.453
My dad's girlfriend knows somebody.

01:38.487 --> 01:40.538
Wow. Symphony?

01:40.589 --> 01:41.622
Junior.

01:41.656 --> 01:43.657
But still, that's a big deal.

01:43.676 --> 01:46.627
Yeah. If I can get the
ascending arpeggio right.

01:46.661 --> 01:50.381
It's nice to see you... so passionate

01:50.432 --> 01:52.333
about your music again.

02:01.510 --> 02:03.344
Remember, you brought me up here

02:03.362 --> 02:05.446
my first day at Anchor Beach?

02:06.582 --> 02:08.316
Yeah.

02:09.618 --> 02:13.454
I never thought I'd still be here. [laughs]

02:15.491 --> 02:18.493
I... I asked you how you felt

02:18.527 --> 02:21.412
when your moms adopted Jesus and Mariana.

02:21.463 --> 02:23.531
Yeah, I, um...

02:23.549 --> 02:27.251
I said this was me and my moms...

02:27.302 --> 02:31.305
[plays simple melody]

02:31.340 --> 02:33.341
... and then the twins came...

02:33.375 --> 02:37.345
[adds accompaniment]

02:37.379 --> 02:42.600
- ... and then Jude...
- [plays richer melody]

02:42.651 --> 02:44.685
- [piano pauses]
- ... and then... you.

02:44.719 --> 02:48.289
[bangs out dark melody]

02:49.491 --> 02:50.608
Is that how you feel?

02:50.659 --> 02:52.493
No.

02:53.746 --> 02:55.613
No. This is... this is you.

02:57.416 --> 03:02.253
[plays bright, rich, flowing melody]

03:09.428 --> 03:11.245
[melody ends]

03:13.565 --> 03:15.566
So we got the court date.

03:16.635 --> 03:19.270
We're getting adopted on Monday.

03:20.305 --> 03:23.407
Wow. Monday.

03:23.442 --> 03:24.742
Yeah.

03:27.379 --> 03:31.365
I should, um, let you get that
arpeggio ascending. [laughs]

03:31.416 --> 03:33.417
Right. Yeah.

03:41.426 --> 03:44.328
[phone ringing, vibrating]

03:48.684 --> 03:50.501
Hey.

03:50.519 --> 03:52.720
<i>[Wyatt] Do you still hate me?</i>

03:52.771 --> 03:55.673
Well, hate's a strong word.

03:55.691 --> 03:57.642
<i>How are you?</i>

03:57.676 --> 04:00.344
I'm good.

04:00.362 --> 04:01.679
<i>You look good.</i>

04:01.697 --> 04:04.248
How would you know?

04:32.511 --> 04:35.563
<i>* It's not where you come from *</i>

04:35.597 --> 04:38.599
<i>* It's where you belong *</i>

04:38.650 --> 04:41.552
<i>* Nothing I would trade *</i>

04:41.570 --> 04:45.273
<i>* I wouldn't have it any other way *</i>

04:45.324 --> 04:50.444

* And you're wanted *</i>

04:50.495 --> 04:53.748
<i>* So never feel alone *</i>

05:08.480 --> 05:10.615
Wait. What exactly is a "Hoosier"?

05:10.649 --> 05:13.584
I don't know, and nobody really does.

05:13.602 --> 05:16.587
But everyone in Indiana
is damn proud to be one.

05:16.605 --> 05:18.723
[laughs]

05:20.525 --> 05:24.428
Hey, so, there's something
I've been wondering...

05:24.446 --> 05:27.565
the next morning, at the motel,

05:27.599 --> 05:31.602
where you kind of freaked out...

05:31.620 --> 05:33.454
was that because...

05:33.488 --> 05:35.623
I mean, were you really going for gas,

05:35.657 --> 05:38.542
or were you trying to get away,

05:38.577 --> 05:40.444
before Lena and Stef got there?

05:40.462 --> 05:45.282
I was trying to get away
before they got there.

05:45.300 --> 05:48.336
- With you.
- But you called them.

05:48.387 --> 05:50.671
I changed my mind.

05:50.722 --> 05:52.590
Why?

05:54.643 --> 05:56.527
You know why.

05:59.431 --> 06:01.699
So you forgive me?

06:01.733 --> 06:04.435
No, there's nothing to forgive.

06:05.637 --> 06:07.471
You did the right thing.

06:11.443 --> 06:13.244
What?

06:13.278 --> 06:14.662
I think you have more hair than me now.

06:14.756 --> 06:16.474
Jealous?

06:16.508 --> 06:18.476
A little.

06:18.510 --> 06:20.594
Ah. [laughs]

06:23.348 --> 06:25.433
We are looking for the X intercept

06:25.484 --> 06:26.734
where Y is zero.

06:26.768 --> 06:29.353
How's wrestling without me?

06:29.387 --> 06:30.721
Same as it was with you.

06:30.756 --> 06:33.591
So, if Y equals zero...

06:33.625 --> 06:35.326
So, you don't miss me at all?

06:35.360 --> 06:37.495
I miss not being the worst one on the team.

06:37.529 --> 06:39.330
[both chuckle]

06:39.364 --> 06:40.498
Come on, write it down.

06:49.674 --> 06:52.760
Look, I really want to
help you do this thing,

06:52.794 --> 06:54.412
without your meds.

06:54.446 --> 06:55.796
But if you're not going
to try to concentrate...

06:55.847 --> 06:58.382
Ok, ok. I promise I'll concentrate.

07:00.385 --> 07:01.585
If you'll go to the Winter Ball with me.

07:01.603 --> 07:03.387
I have a date.

07:03.422 --> 07:06.307
- Who?
- None of your business.

07:06.358 --> 07:07.475
[Jesus] What's his name?

07:07.526 --> 07:09.560
[whispers] Shush.

07:09.594 --> 07:10.644
[Curt] Jesus.

07:10.695 --> 07:12.429
Would you like to stay after school?

07:12.447 --> 07:14.365
Would you?

07:15.600 --> 07:17.735
How about a little more
algebra, a little less attitude.

07:17.769 --> 07:19.770
Yes, sir.

07:27.612 --> 07:29.580
[Amanda] Mariana!

07:29.614 --> 07:31.549
Guess who I'm here to see?

07:31.583 --> 07:32.616
Who?

07:32.651 --> 07:35.469
- Your mother.
- My mother?

07:35.504 --> 07:37.338
About the dance.

07:37.389 --> 07:39.790
Oh my... did I scare you?

07:39.808 --> 07:41.425
Yeah, a little.

07:41.459 --> 07:43.594
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to do that.

07:43.628 --> 07:45.513
- Mom?
- Oh, shoot.

07:45.564 --> 07:47.464
It's supposed to be a surprise.

07:47.482 --> 07:48.632
What?

07:48.667 --> 07:50.534
I'm volunteering to be a chaperone

07:50.569 --> 07:53.354
at Metropolis: The Winter Ball!

07:53.405 --> 07:56.707
But don't worry, I'm all for dirty dancing.

07:56.741 --> 07:58.526
Oh! I got to dash.

07:58.577 --> 08:01.612
Don't want to keep someone's
future mother-in-law waiting.

08:01.646 --> 08:03.581
- Mom...
- Ok.

08:05.700 --> 08:09.453
Well, at least she likes me today.

08:09.487 --> 08:11.655
Why does everything have to be a surprise?

08:11.673 --> 08:14.542
Yeah, you'd think her
mood swings were enough.

08:16.327 --> 08:17.545
Sorry.

08:17.596 --> 08:20.631
But, you know, maybe she
needs to see a doctor.

08:20.665 --> 08:23.434
No, she doesn't. She's... eccentric.

08:23.468 --> 08:25.469
She called me a whore.

08:25.503 --> 08:27.471
Maybe she had a little too much wine.

08:27.505 --> 08:29.356
She doesn't even remember.

08:29.391 --> 08:31.675
Hey, she obviously loves you.

08:33.611 --> 08:36.447
So, speaking of the ball,

08:36.481 --> 08:38.566
have you thought about...

08:38.616 --> 08:40.534
Are you going?

08:40.568 --> 08:43.453
Not sure. Are you going?

08:43.488 --> 08:46.457
I sort of have to since my mom's
in charge of the whole thing.

08:46.491 --> 08:48.325
Oh, right.

08:49.628 --> 08:52.329
Uh... well, I better get to class.

08:59.721 --> 09:02.339
- Hey. Still on nights?
- Yep.

09:02.373 --> 09:03.707
Do you know for how much longer?

09:03.725 --> 09:06.343
'Cause I really don't like
that Brandon's alone at night.

09:06.377 --> 09:08.646
- He's sixteen.
- Yeah, exactly.

09:08.680 --> 09:10.397
And he's not always alone.

09:10.432 --> 09:11.715
Dani's over a lot.

09:11.733 --> 09:14.685
She makes him dinner
practically every night.

09:16.521 --> 09:18.355
- How's he doing?
- He's doing great.

09:18.389 --> 09:19.740
He's practicing hard for his audition.

09:19.774 --> 09:21.742
He's really back on track.

09:23.745 --> 09:26.396
Well, good. Means he can come home soon.

09:26.414 --> 09:28.532
Yeah, I'll tell Dani you say thank you.

09:32.621 --> 09:35.405
- Stefanie Foster?
- Yeah?

09:35.423 --> 09:38.742
- I'm Ana Gutierrez...
- I know who you are.

09:39.744 --> 09:41.595
Well, we need to talk.

09:41.630 --> 09:43.764
About what?

09:43.815 --> 09:46.517
About your son.

09:48.470 --> 09:50.387
He gave me money.

09:51.756 --> 09:54.358
To change my story.

09:54.392 --> 09:57.528
To say I wasn't there the night
that your partner killed Evan.

09:59.614 --> 10:01.365
You're out of your mind.

10:01.399 --> 10:02.783
Ask him.

10:02.817 --> 10:05.486
I don't need to.

10:05.537 --> 10:07.454
I'll tell the DA.

10:07.489 --> 10:10.741
Unless...

10:10.775 --> 10:13.711
I want $10,000.

10:13.745 --> 10:16.380
And then you'll never see me again.

10:18.633 --> 10:21.502
If I do see you again,

10:21.553 --> 10:24.638
I will arrest you for trying
to extort a police officer.

10:35.469 --> 10:38.838
Woo! Looking good there,
my friend. Thank you.

10:38.856 --> 10:40.607
I got to stay in shape

10:40.641 --> 10:41.858
for when I get back on the wrestling team.

10:41.893 --> 10:44.611
Oh, yeah? Well, I'll tell you
what, you should try studying

10:44.645 --> 10:48.448
because that's not going to happen
until you get your grades up.

10:48.482 --> 10:51.418
Exercise helps me concentrate.

10:51.452 --> 10:53.703
Mm-hmm. Let me ask you this.

10:53.738 --> 10:56.706
Have you considered
going back on your meds?

10:56.741 --> 10:58.858
[panting]

10:58.876 --> 11:00.627
No.

11:00.661 --> 11:02.462
Well, uh, Lena mentioned

11:02.496 --> 11:04.414
that some of your teachers are concerned

11:04.465 --> 11:07.550
because you've been a
little on edge lately.

11:07.585 --> 11:09.753
They just don't want to deal.

11:09.804 --> 11:11.704
You said you'd give me a chance to do this.

11:11.722 --> 11:13.607
It hasn't been that long.

11:13.641 --> 11:15.508
Ok, we'll give you some more time.

11:15.543 --> 11:17.394
But I want to see a change in your grades

11:17.428 --> 11:18.612
and your attitude.

11:18.646 --> 11:19.846
Yeah, ok.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.848
Ok.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.600
You got some guns there, Mom.

11:23.651 --> 11:26.569
Yeah, I know, I know. I
work out. I got to, right?

11:28.406 --> 11:30.390
Listen, you haven't, uh,

11:30.408 --> 11:33.727
you haven't seen... Ana, have you?

11:33.867 --> 11:35.768
Ana? No.

11:35.802 --> 11:38.704
Not since... at the hospital.

11:38.739 --> 11:41.574
- Ok. Ok.
- Why?

11:41.608 --> 11:44.610
No. Just, uh, just checking in.

11:44.644 --> 11:46.562
But if she ever does try to contact you

11:46.613 --> 11:48.814
or your sister, you will
let me know right away. Yes?

11:48.849 --> 11:50.583
- Yeah. Ok.
- Ok.

11:50.617 --> 11:52.684
So how many pull-ups can you do?

11:52.702 --> 11:54.686
- More than you.
- Oh, please.

11:54.704 --> 11:56.872
You little whippersnapper.
Get out of the way here.

11:56.907 --> 11:59.858
You just want to see an old lady sweat.

11:59.876 --> 12:02.528
- Put your money where your mouth is.
- I'm going to bed.

12:02.562 --> 12:04.463
- You can get... Aw!
- I love you.

12:04.498 --> 12:07.466
Doesn't he realize that only
like losers go to dances alone?

12:07.501 --> 12:08.768
I'm going alone.

12:08.802 --> 12:12.755
Well, you could ask Wyatt. It's
all over school that he's back.

12:12.806 --> 12:16.509
Well, he's not back yet.
And he wouldn't want to go.

12:16.543 --> 12:17.893
Well, I can't believe
they're announcing nominations

12:17.928 --> 12:19.645
for Winter King and Queen tomorrow

12:19.679 --> 12:20.846
and I don't even have a date.

12:20.880 --> 12:22.915
Maybe Zac's waiting for you to ask him.

12:22.949 --> 12:24.650
Why?

12:24.684 --> 12:26.852
The panty incident?

12:26.887 --> 12:28.521
Oh, my God.

12:28.555 --> 12:29.888
Can everyone please
stop talking about that?

12:29.906 --> 12:33.559
I'm just saying, he might be gun shy.

12:36.663 --> 12:38.730
His mother was all right with it?

12:38.748 --> 12:40.533
Yeah, I guess he wasn't happy in Indiana

12:40.567 --> 12:41.784
and a friend's family said

12:41.835 --> 12:43.536
he could come and live with them.

12:43.570 --> 12:45.921
And, uh, how do we feel

12:45.956 --> 12:49.508
about Wyatt being back in Callie's life?

12:49.543 --> 12:52.545
He did call us to come get her.

12:52.579 --> 12:53.796
That was the right thing to do.

12:53.847 --> 12:56.849
Yeah, but letting her
run away with him was not.

12:56.883 --> 12:59.585
I think he's a good kid.

12:59.603 --> 13:01.587
Maybe it's a good thing...

13:01.605 --> 13:03.806
... for both Callie and Brandon.

13:03.857 --> 13:07.493
You think Callie's going
to start dating him again?

13:07.527 --> 13:09.778
It wouldn't be the worst thing.

13:09.813 --> 13:11.730
- Honey, that's...
- Oh, I'm sorry.

13:20.824 --> 13:23.542
Hey, do you think for one night

13:23.577 --> 13:25.628
we could sleep on a level playing field?

13:25.662 --> 13:28.497
I'd love to see your beautiful
face and not the mattress.

13:28.548 --> 13:30.833
I've just got all these
baby books to read, honey.

13:30.884 --> 13:33.785
It's not that complicated.
They eat, they cry, they poop.

13:33.803 --> 13:35.654
That's pretty much all you need to know.

13:40.677 --> 13:42.761
I know we can't afford a new mattress,

13:42.795 --> 13:44.730
but what if we can sell this one, huh?

13:44.764 --> 13:45.931
We could do that.

13:45.965 --> 13:47.850
No, I think it's illegal
to sell a used mattress?

13:47.901 --> 13:49.902
No, it's illegal to cut tags off pillows.

13:49.936 --> 13:51.904
- Why is that?
- I don't know.

13:51.938 --> 13:55.524
Look, I hate this crack
between the two of us.

13:55.575 --> 13:57.693
We barely cuddle anymore.
Hello, over there.

13:57.744 --> 13:58.827
I think we should keep it.

13:58.862 --> 14:00.613
It'll be great when I'm pregnant.

14:00.647 --> 14:03.666
Adjust the position, be more comfortable.

14:04.918 --> 14:07.836
Yeah, you're right.

14:07.871 --> 14:11.707
[sighs] Someday we'll be intimate again.

14:11.758 --> 14:12.925
It's fine, it's fine.

14:12.959 --> 14:15.661
Honey, we were intimate last
week, when we inseminated.

14:15.695 --> 14:18.497
[laughs] Nothing intimate about that.

14:22.502 --> 14:23.936

14:26.506 --> 14:29.675

14:46.793 --> 14:48.961
You barely touched your dinner.

14:50.931 --> 14:53.666
Uh... sorry. I... wasn't hungry.

14:54.968 --> 14:57.636
You want to talk about it?

14:59.589 --> 15:02.474
Callie and Jude are getting adopted Monday.

15:03.677 --> 15:05.477
Like, officially.

15:07.847 --> 15:10.482
Is that what's bothering you?

15:10.517 --> 15:13.769
No. I mean, I want her to get adopted.

15:13.820 --> 15:15.587
It's just,

15:15.622 --> 15:18.891
the guy she ran away with,

15:18.925 --> 15:21.727
he's back, I guess.

15:21.761 --> 15:22.895
What's the story with him?

15:22.989 --> 15:26.892
They dated, um, when she
started at Anchor Beach.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.510
Nothing serious.

15:28.561 --> 15:30.863
Well, if she starts seeing him again,

15:30.897 --> 15:32.598
you only have yourself to blame.

15:35.602 --> 15:38.537
You moved in with your dad
to give yourself some space,

15:38.571 --> 15:39.988
to get over Callie.

15:40.023 --> 15:41.774
But all you're really doing

15:41.808 --> 15:44.910
is giving her the space to get over you.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.812
If she hasn't already.

15:46.830 --> 15:48.530
Well, what am I supposed to do?

15:48.581 --> 15:50.999
- I mean, I just...
- Tell her.

15:51.034 --> 15:55.754
Tell her that you're not
going to get over each other.

15:55.789 --> 15:58.006
Look. Why don't I get your dad

15:58.041 --> 15:59.875
to take me to a movie tomorrow night

15:59.926 --> 16:03.495
before he goes into work.

16:03.530 --> 16:06.932
You guys can have the place to
yourself for a couple of hours.

16:06.966 --> 16:10.719
To talk, or, you know... whatever.

16:13.006 --> 16:16.675
You have to convince her it's not too late.

I'm here! I'm here!

17:34.903 --> 17:38.288
So, I was going to wait for you to ask me,

17:38.323 --> 17:40.240
but then Callie made me realize...

17:40.274 --> 17:42.042
Whoa, stop.

17:42.077 --> 17:43.944
Follow me.

17:53.138 --> 17:54.221
Open it.

17:56.124 --> 17:59.126
[laughs] What is this?

17:59.144 --> 18:03.814
Mystery Date. You know, the board game.

18:03.865 --> 18:05.265
Is it new?

18:05.299 --> 18:08.301
No. It's like, old. It's really old.

18:10.071 --> 18:12.856
It was my mom's favorite
game from when she was a girl.

18:14.242 --> 18:16.026
I told her you wouldn't get it.

18:16.077 --> 18:17.911
Well, what's the mystery?

18:17.946 --> 18:20.147
Well, see, you don't know
who's behind the door.

18:20.165 --> 18:21.949
It could be your dream date

18:21.983 --> 18:23.917
or, you know, a bum.

18:23.952 --> 18:26.153
So, which are you?

18:26.171 --> 18:28.122
Hopefully not a bum.

18:29.340 --> 18:31.875
My mom thought that it
would be a "charming" way

18:31.926 --> 18:35.045
of asking you to be my
date to the Winter Ball.

18:36.881 --> 18:38.265
It is charming.

[grunts]

- Holding a grudge?

18:55.283 --> 18:56.316
I guess. I don't know.

18:56.350 --> 18:57.951
He promised some great revenge,

18:57.986 --> 19:00.187
but so far, it's been keying
my car and bumping into me.

19:00.205 --> 19:02.956
Well, let's hope that's as far as it goes.

19:02.991 --> 19:06.910
Uh, so, I was, uh, wondering if...

19:06.961 --> 19:10.197
Can you come over after
school? To my dad's?

19:10.215 --> 19:12.249
Why? What's up?

Well, no, there's just
something I need you to hear.

19:16.004 --> 19:17.137
Oh, for your audition?

19:17.172 --> 19:19.256
I could meet you in
the music room at lunch?

19:19.307 --> 19:22.876
Actually, it kind of
needs to be at my dad's.

19:22.894 --> 19:25.262
Ok. Well, I have group,

19:25.313 --> 19:29.183
so I could stop by after, like around 4:30.

Can't they help you out?

He actually didn't ask his parents

20:42.223 --> 20:44.141
if I could live with them until I got here.

I still think you should go, though.

Why?

23:02.997 --> 23:03.997
What?

23:04.032 --> 23:06.283
Principal Sanchez did not give

[Lena] That you are not making friends,

23:13.341 --> 23:16.159
and not participating in school activities.

23:16.177 --> 23:18.345
Well, she should write that the

You don't know that for sure.

23:39.150 --> 23:41.017
- As a joke.
- He wouldn't know that.

And if it is a joke,
you'd have the last laugh.

23:42.987 --> 23:45.205
- That's what Wyatt said.
- [Lena] I think he's right.

23:45.239 --> 23:48.125
You know, when I was in school
they used to call me "Oreo."

23:48.159 --> 23:50.327
- Because I'm bi-racial.
- That's lame.

23:50.361 --> 23:53.196
Not as lame as when they
found out I was a lesbian.

23:53.214 --> 23:55.298
Then they called me a "Klon-Dyke Bar."

23:55.333 --> 23:57.300
[laughs]

23:59.003 --> 24:00.303
That's not funny.

It's not funny. It's mean. It's very mean.

24:04.175 --> 24:05.308
So, what did you do about it?

24:05.343 --> 24:09.179
Well, I brought a hundred
Klondike Bars to school one day,

24:09.213 --> 24:12.065
I passed them out to all the kids,

24:12.100 --> 24:14.067
and they never called me that again.

24:14.102 --> 24:16.103
That's kind of awesome.

24:16.154 --> 24:19.222
Sometimes, the best way to
fight back is to rise above.

24:57.327 --> 24:58.660
How's business?

24:58.711 --> 25:01.663
It's pretty good. There's a run on punch.

Now I'll be able to get my car back.

25:12.308 --> 25:14.426
She hasn't tried to beat me up. Yet.

25:14.460 --> 25:17.346

Look at you, you're at the Winter Ball,

25:19.298 --> 25:21.400

25:21.434 --> 25:23.485
You even kept your name on the ballot.

25:23.519 --> 25:25.470
Yeah. I'm "rising above."

25:26.522 --> 25:29.441
And I'm pouring punch.

25:29.475 --> 25:31.326
Maybe you'll dance with me later?

25:31.361 --> 25:32.577
Maybe.

25:36.749 --> 25:39.651
After they get a ballot, they
get a stamp on their wrist,

25:39.669 --> 25:41.336
so that they can't vote again.

25:41.371 --> 25:43.321
Ok, I got it. No ballot stuffing.

25:43.339 --> 25:46.291
This isn't Florida. I'm all over it.

25:46.325 --> 25:47.509
Great, thank you.

25:48.678 --> 25:51.329
You really knocked yourself out this year.

25:51.364 --> 25:53.632
Yeah. The kids seem to be
having a great time, right?

25:53.666 --> 25:55.600
I wish Callie was.

25:57.470 --> 25:59.554
She's here. That's what counts.

25:59.605 --> 26:03.675
Oh. And nominated for Winter Queen.

26:03.693 --> 26:07.229
Yeah, the kids must be
really taking a liking to her.

26:10.650 --> 26:13.368
Oh, my son is here. Excuse me.

26:13.403 --> 26:16.371
Wow. I was beginning to think
you weren't going to show.

26:16.406 --> 26:17.656
You really know how to throw a party.

26:17.690 --> 26:19.624
Thank you.

26:19.659 --> 26:22.627
Uh, Brandon, will you do me a favor?

26:24.547 --> 26:25.714
Could you ask Callie to dance?

26:28.751 --> 26:31.303
Brothers can ask sisters to dance, right?

26:31.337 --> 26:33.638
I just... I don't really
feel like dancing right now.

26:33.673 --> 26:35.540
Brandon, please?

26:35.558 --> 26:38.593
And if you could dance
near Principal Sanchez,

26:38.644 --> 26:41.313
that would be great.

26:46.569 --> 26:49.387
[rock music plays]

26:49.405 --> 26:51.656
I'll be right back.

26:55.661 --> 26:58.236
Kyle Dumbass, really?

26:58.238 --> 27:01.323
I'm just saying, you could do better.

27:02.459 --> 27:04.543
God knows I've done worse.

27:11.534 --> 27:13.302
Hey.

27:13.336 --> 27:14.553
I thought you bailed.

27:14.587 --> 27:16.204
You want to dance?

27:16.222 --> 27:18.474
It's ok. Lena asked me to ask you.

27:18.508 --> 27:21.260
Something about looking
like you're having fun?

27:21.311 --> 27:23.228
Right.

27:23.263 --> 27:25.230
Yeah, thanks.

27:34.390 --> 27:37.276
Hey, I just voted for you!

27:37.327 --> 27:39.227
Thanks!

27:49.672 --> 27:52.624
[distorted laughter, chatter]

28:00.633 --> 28:03.585
[boys talking indistinctly in stall]

28:03.603 --> 28:05.354
Hey, let me in.

28:06.606 --> 28:08.357
- What's up?
- This the place?

28:08.391 --> 28:09.591
Close the door.

28:12.695 --> 28:14.396
Awesome.

28:17.700 --> 28:20.536
Well, to Callie Jacob.

28:20.570 --> 28:22.404
Yeah, Callie Jacob.

28:22.438 --> 28:24.439
[music continuing]

28:34.656 --> 28:36.309
Can we go somewhere and talk?

28:36.327 --> 28:37.476
Ok.

28:44.335 --> 28:46.669
[slow pop song playing]

28:46.704 --> 28:49.505
<i>* Enter my galaxy *</i>

28:55.662 --> 28:57.597
- Oh, man.
- That's awesome.

29:06.707 --> 29:08.308
May I?

29:08.342 --> 29:10.443
Oh, um, sure.

29:26.293 --> 29:27.627
I know what's going on.

29:27.661 --> 29:30.663
- What?
- I'm not a fool.

29:30.697 --> 29:33.416
I know you're screwing her.

29:33.467 --> 29:35.551
What I don't understand
is how you can flaunt it

29:35.586 --> 29:37.503
in front of all our friends.

29:37.537 --> 29:39.305
Mom...

29:39.340 --> 29:42.642
I won't be humiliated, Zachary. I won't.

29:45.479 --> 29:47.647
What happened?

29:53.354 --> 29:55.238
I'm sorry.

29:55.272 --> 29:57.724
Just this whole Winter Queen thing

29:57.758 --> 30:01.394
is making me feel really uncomfortable.

30:01.412 --> 30:04.664
Honestly, I am so tired of being judged.

30:04.698 --> 30:07.283
I'm tired, too.

30:07.334 --> 30:08.501
Of what?

30:08.535 --> 30:12.372
Of being here whenever you
need my shoulder to cry on.

30:12.406 --> 30:14.574
What about when I need you?

30:14.608 --> 30:17.293
What about when I needed
to talk to you the other day

30:17.344 --> 30:19.679
and you just blew me off?

30:19.713 --> 30:22.415
I didn't, I... I was with Wyatt.

30:22.433 --> 30:24.583
Oh good, that makes me feel so much better.

30:24.601 --> 30:26.686
He was living in his car,
so I took him to Daphne's.

30:26.720 --> 30:28.471
Then why don't you get a place together?

30:28.522 --> 30:30.423
I mean, that was the plan, right?

30:30.441 --> 30:32.291
- If you'd made it to Indiana.
- Where's this is coming from?

30:32.326 --> 30:34.477
I'm still in love with you.

30:34.528 --> 30:35.761
Don't.

30:37.781 --> 30:39.449
We can't...

30:39.483 --> 30:40.566
Yes, we can.

30:40.600 --> 30:42.568
You can still get adopted.

30:42.603 --> 30:44.770
And... I'll stay at my dad's.

30:44.788 --> 30:46.406
We can see each other there.

30:46.440 --> 30:48.341
Behind everybody's backs?

30:48.375 --> 30:50.443
Then we'll wait till we're 18...

30:50.461 --> 30:53.713
Brandon, I'm going to be your sister.

30:53.747 --> 30:55.381
We're not related.

30:55.416 --> 30:57.684
We don't share the same blood.

30:57.718 --> 31:01.337
There's nothing wrong
or illegal about that.

31:01.388 --> 31:03.389
So...

31:03.424 --> 31:06.342
if you're not really my brother,

31:06.393 --> 31:09.629
then Stef and Lena won't
really be my mothers.

31:10.764 --> 31:14.434
- No, it's not the same.
- It's exactly the same.

31:14.468 --> 31:17.303
I need a family.

31:17.321 --> 31:19.405
Not a piece of paper.

31:19.440 --> 31:23.326
If that's what adoption
is, then what's the point?

31:29.500 --> 31:31.534
Hey, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

31:31.585 --> 31:33.286
We can't keep doing this.

31:33.320 --> 31:35.705
But we do. We keep doing this.

31:35.756 --> 31:39.592
Because what we feel,
happens once in a lifetime.

31:39.626 --> 31:42.378
- You have to let me go.
- We have to fight for it.

31:42.429 --> 31:44.430
Please.

31:45.682 --> 31:47.467
Then, help me.

31:48.502 --> 31:50.603
Tell me you don't love me anymore.

31:50.637 --> 31:54.474
Tell me something to make me get over you.

31:55.642 --> 31:57.560
I had sex with Wyatt.

32:00.280 --> 32:03.533
When we ran away, we stayed
in the same motel room.

32:03.567 --> 32:05.685
Slept in the same bed.

32:08.489 --> 32:11.524
In the middle of the night,
I curled up next to him.

32:11.542 --> 32:14.494
We were half asleep... it just happened.

32:36.433 --> 32:38.734
If I can have everyone's attention, please.

32:38.769 --> 32:41.521
Can all the nominees
for Winter King and Queen

32:41.555 --> 32:43.606
please come up on stage?

32:52.332 --> 32:53.499
Her car's still here.

32:53.534 --> 32:55.585
That's a good thing, I guess.

32:55.619 --> 32:57.403
Go back in the party. I'll find her.

32:57.421 --> 32:59.305
Not alone you won't.

33:04.545 --> 33:06.596
Your votes have been counted

33:06.630 --> 33:09.549
and your Winter King and Queen are...

33:45.752 --> 33:50.423
So, how does it feel to
be Winter King and Queen?

Uh... Awesome!

[cheering]

33:55.629 --> 33:57.680
Callie? Do you have anything to say?

33:58.649 --> 33:59.632
Um...

34:03.270 --> 34:06.522
Um... this is such an honor.

34:06.573 --> 34:09.609
I want to thank everyone who voted for me

34:09.643 --> 34:12.612
and just say from the bottom of my heart,

34:12.646 --> 34:17.250
how thrilled I am to be your Winter Queen.

- What's going on in here?

34:58.709 --> 35:02.211
She... just... she doesn't feel well.

35:05.365 --> 35:06.532
Get out here, right now.

35:08.702 --> 35:11.337
[bottle clinks, rolls]

35:13.307 --> 35:15.341
Where did this alcohol come from?

35:16.677 --> 35:19.562
Callie Jacob bought it,
so we'd vote for her.

35:27.025 --> 35:29.090
I didn't even want to be Winter queen.

35:29.094 --> 35:30.812
- You could have fooled me.
- No, I was just...

35:30.846 --> 35:32.731
She wanted to take her name off the ballot.

35:32.765 --> 35:35.100
- Then why didn't she?
- We encouraged her not to.

35:35.134 --> 35:37.869
We thought it might look
good to her parole officer.

35:37.903 --> 35:39.838
Oh, and winning would look even better.

35:39.872 --> 35:42.774
How would she even buy
alcohol? She's 16 years old.

35:42.808 --> 35:45.143
- She could have a fake ID.
- I don't have a fake ID.

35:45.161 --> 35:48.079
You can search my purse.
I'll go get it right now.

35:48.114 --> 35:50.698
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:50.750 --> 35:51.950
Karina. What's going on?

35:51.984 --> 35:54.986
- I'm being set up.
- By whom?

35:57.056 --> 35:58.990
I don't know.

35:59.024 --> 36:01.926
[pop music playing]

36:03.662 --> 36:05.096
Slow your roll there.

36:09.051 --> 36:11.770
- Hey, hey.
- What do you want?

36:11.804 --> 36:13.772
- How about your car keys.
- Jesus...

36:13.806 --> 36:14.889
He's drunk.

36:14.940 --> 36:17.108
Look, dude, just mind your own business.

36:18.144 --> 36:19.894
- Let him go!
- I just want his keys!

36:19.945 --> 36:23.114
Get off him! He's not driving! Ok?

36:23.149 --> 36:25.033
- I am!
- I was just...

36:25.067 --> 36:28.653
Being a jerk! Just stay away from me!

36:36.829 --> 36:37.862
Mom?

36:42.751 --> 36:44.135
Hello.

36:44.570 --> 36:46.721
[stammering] Are you ok?

36:50.042 --> 36:51.759
I'm fine.

36:53.045 --> 36:54.813
Let's go home.

36:56.732 --> 36:58.850
Home? I'm...

36:58.884 --> 37:02.821
I'm sorry... do I know you?

37:06.108 --> 37:07.909
It's me.

37:09.662 --> 37:11.029
Zac.

37:11.063 --> 37:14.699
Your... your son.

37:25.678 --> 37:27.078
That's not mine.

37:27.096 --> 37:29.097
It's got your picture and your name on it.

37:29.131 --> 37:31.749
Let me see.

37:31.767 --> 37:33.635
I'm sorry.

37:33.686 --> 37:35.086
I'm going to have to call the police.

37:37.923 --> 37:40.892
I'm going to keep this.
Like wear it every day.

37:40.926 --> 37:43.862
Hey, you think you can get
to me by hurting Callie?

37:43.896 --> 37:44.896
You seem pretty upset about it.

37:44.930 --> 37:46.097
She could get sent back to juvie!

37:46.115 --> 37:48.032
Which would break your heart, wouldn't it?

37:48.067 --> 37:50.902
All I have to do is tell them you set
her up because I bought back the IDs.

37:50.936 --> 37:54.606
What IDs? The kids we sold
to aren't going to talk,

37:54.640 --> 37:56.074
so it's your word against mine.

37:56.108 --> 37:57.909
She didn't do anything to you.

37:57.943 --> 38:01.079
Well, she did ask me to make
her a fake ID. Which I did.

38:01.113 --> 38:04.048
And when they check her phone, they'll see
she texted a few kids to spread the word

38:04.083 --> 38:05.683
about the complimentary
booze in the bathroom...

38:05.718 --> 38:07.001
[both shouting]

38:07.052 --> 38:09.971
- Hey, hey! Whoa, whoa!
- Get your hands off me!

38:10.005 --> 38:11.089
What the hell is going on here?

38:11.123 --> 38:12.674
Get out of my face!

38:12.725 --> 38:13.892
If you know what's going down with Callie,

38:13.926 --> 38:15.810
you need to do something, now.

38:19.815 --> 38:21.683
[man] Can you think of any reason

38:21.734 --> 38:23.067
someone would go through all this trouble

38:23.102 --> 38:25.637
to make this fake ID and
plant it in your purse?

38:26.839 --> 38:29.741
Callie, you need to tell the truth.

38:29.775 --> 38:30.858
We don't know that she's not.

38:30.910 --> 38:33.695
I'd like to see those texts, please.

38:33.746 --> 38:36.881
- Brandon, not now.
- I know who did this.

38:36.916 --> 38:38.082
Oh, yeah? Who?

38:39.001 --> 38:40.752
It was me.

38:42.037 --> 38:44.038
Be very careful what you
say right now, Brandon.

38:44.089 --> 38:45.757
I set Callie up.

38:45.791 --> 38:48.059
I planted the fake ID in her purse.

38:48.093 --> 38:50.828
I sent texts from her
phone. I bought the alcohol.

38:50.846 --> 38:52.046
- Everything.
- Brandon...

38:52.097 --> 38:54.032
He's obviously trying to protect her.

38:54.066 --> 38:55.049
No. I'm not.

38:56.719 --> 38:59.771
I wanted to hurt her because she hurt me.

39:01.106 --> 39:04.943
She led me on and made me
believe she cared about me.

39:04.977 --> 39:06.844
And she lied.

39:08.847 --> 39:11.049
So, I wanted to send her back to juvie

39:11.083 --> 39:12.617
so we wouldn't adopt her.

39:12.651 --> 39:14.953
How did you buy the alcohol?

39:14.987 --> 39:16.854
With this.

39:16.889 --> 39:22.627
I took your key and made the
IDs on the machine at school.

39:22.661 --> 39:23.694
Why come forward now?

39:24.997 --> 39:27.715
Because I realized
tonight that I was wrong.

39:27.750 --> 39:29.834
- She didn't lead me on...
- Don't do this.

39:29.868 --> 39:31.636
Let me talk, Callie.

39:33.939 --> 39:37.008
I realized tonight that
you didn't lead me on.

39:39.878 --> 39:43.848
You just never felt the
way I did. Not really.

39:45.901 --> 39:47.852
It was all in my head.

39:47.886 --> 39:51.789
And I should've accepted
what you kept telling me.

39:51.824 --> 39:53.908
What you needed. What you wanted.

39:53.959 --> 39:56.928
It was never me.

40:02.701 --> 40:04.002
What do you want me to do?

40:05.838 --> 40:08.139
Arrest him.

40:08.173 --> 40:11.926
[Sanchez over PA] Every student will
be subjected to a sobriety test...

40:11.960 --> 40:14.762
Wait. What's going on? Brandon?!

40:18.017 --> 40:19.917
Are you ok?

40:33.782 --> 40:35.099
Brandon!

40:37.119 --> 40:39.787
- Callie, stay back.
- It wasn't true.

40:39.822 --> 40:42.990
What I said about Wyatt, it was not true.

40:56.138 --> 40:57.955
- Where is he?
- He's still in the car.

40:57.973 --> 40:59.924
I talked to the guys
who brought Brandon in.

40:59.958 --> 41:01.125
They don't want to do
the paperwork on this.

41:14.773 --> 41:15.973
You better start talking,

41:15.991 --> 41:18.659
and I don't want one more
lie to come out of your mouth.

41:23.749 --> 41:25.717
I did take the key...

41:28.721 --> 41:32.757
... and I did make fake IDs with Vico.

41:32.791 --> 41:35.026
But then, I realized it was a mistake,

41:35.060 --> 41:37.762
so I bought them all back.

41:37.796 --> 41:40.164
And, um... and then he got pissed.

41:40.182 --> 41:42.850
And he set up Callie to get back at me.

41:42.885 --> 41:44.902
Why would you make fake IDs?

41:44.937 --> 41:46.771
To sell them.

41:46.805 --> 41:48.706
Yes, I realize that.

41:48.741 --> 41:50.742
Why?

41:50.776 --> 41:54.645
I needed the money to pay you back

41:54.680 --> 41:57.782
for all the piano lessons I didn't go to.

41:57.816 --> 41:59.650
You paid me back.

42:02.988 --> 42:05.089
Dani gave me that money.

42:05.124 --> 42:07.925
To give to you.

42:07.960 --> 42:09.927
What happened to your father's money?

42:13.132 --> 42:14.932
I gave it to Ana.

42:15.968 --> 42:18.136
You gave the money to Ana?

42:18.170 --> 42:19.971
Why?

42:21.774 --> 42:23.908
To change her story.

42:23.942 --> 42:25.810
So you wouldn't go on trial.
