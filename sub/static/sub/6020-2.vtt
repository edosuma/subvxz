00:05.139 --> 00:07.969
You know, I can now bite
my fingernails so evenly...

00:08.042 --> 00:10.201
I don't even need
to use a clipper anymore.

00:10.278 --> 00:11.970
But it's a pleasure to use clippers.

00:12.046 --> 00:15.411
Why gnaw away like a mental patient
when we have this elegant device?

00:18.953 --> 00:20.418
What if you're in prison?

00:20.488 --> 00:23.318
- You don't think they give clippers?
- No, it's like a weapon.

00:23.391 --> 00:25.789
You know what's really a weapon,
that big toenail.

00:25.860 --> 00:29.623
You let that grow for a month,
take it in the shower, it's like a shiv.

00:31.299 --> 00:32.729
I love prison.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.959
It is fascinating.

00:35.203 --> 00:38.500
Yeah, maybe someday.

00:44.345 --> 00:47.278
You want me to find
a poem about Susan?

00:47.348 --> 00:49.473
May she rest in peace.

00:49.951 --> 00:54.112
Well, we think it would be a nice touch
for the foundation literature.

00:54.222 --> 00:56.916
You have a favorite poet, George?

00:57.959 --> 01:01.460
I like Flavman.

01:02.663 --> 01:05.391
- Pardon?
- Flavman.

01:06.367 --> 01:09.163
Well, you should choose the poem
since you knew Susan best...

01:09.237 --> 01:13.171
at the time
of her unfortunate... accident.

01:17.378 --> 01:19.571
- He cleared his throat?
- Yes.

01:19.647 --> 01:20.975
So?

01:21.048 --> 01:24.584
He did it right as he said,
"Her unfortunate accident."

01:24.652 --> 01:25.946
Not getting it.

01:26.020 --> 01:28.884
Jerry, a throat clear is a non-verbal
implication of doubt.

01:28.956 --> 01:30.489
He thinks I killed Susan.

01:30.558 --> 01:33.388
Oh, help me, Rhonda.

01:34.996 --> 01:37.155
- What time is it?
- One-fifteen.

01:37.231 --> 01:38.821
Right now?

01:39.634 --> 01:41.497
I gotta go meet Pam.

01:41.569 --> 01:43.500
Oh, the bookstore girl.
How's that going?

01:43.571 --> 01:46.333
Okay. I'm just not gaga over her.

01:46.407 --> 01:47.997
For once, I'd like to be gaga.

01:48.075 --> 01:49.403
Where's Elaine?

01:49.477 --> 01:51.272
She's having Carol,
Gail and Lisa over.

01:51.345 --> 01:52.912
You know, they all have kids now.

01:52.980 --> 01:54.945
What's with all these people
having babies?

01:55.016 --> 01:57.516
- Perpetuation of the species.
- Yeah, right.

01:57.919 --> 02:00.579
- By the way, just for the record...
- No, I did not.

02:00.655 --> 02:02.279
All right.

02:03.257 --> 02:07.350
But because it comes out
of your baby, it smells good.

02:08.362 --> 02:11.363
Well, that's... That's sweet.

02:11.432 --> 02:14.695
Being a mother
has made me feel so beautiful.

02:15.369 --> 02:19.405
Elaine, you gotta have a baby.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.666
Oh, hey, you know...

02:21.742 --> 02:23.275
I had a piece of whitefish...

02:23.344 --> 02:26.106
over at Barney Greengrass
the other day and l...

02:26.414 --> 02:29.972
Elaine, move to Long lsland
and have a baby already.

02:30.051 --> 02:33.245
- I really like the city.
- The city's a toilet.

02:33.321 --> 02:35.548
When's the last time
you saw my little Adam?

02:35.623 --> 02:37.486
It was in the Hamptons.

02:37.558 --> 02:40.149
- Oh, I have pictures.
- No, no, that's okay. It's...

02:40.227 --> 02:43.922
Look at him, just look at him.

02:45.599 --> 02:48.668
Elaine was telling me about
this whitefish she had the other day.

02:48.736 --> 02:51.100
Do you really think I'm wrong
about this Wyck guy?

02:51.172 --> 02:52.830
If you really wanna test him out...

02:52.907 --> 02:54.907
why don't you try
the Jerry Lewis trick?

02:54.976 --> 02:57.510
- Jerry Lewis?
- I heard when Jerry left a meeting...

02:57.578 --> 03:00.476
he'd purposely leave a briefcase
with a tape recorder in it.

03:00.548 --> 03:04.106
After five minutes, he'd come back,
listen to what everyone said.

03:04.185 --> 03:05.877
- That's pretty paranoid.
- Yes, it is.

03:05.953 --> 03:08.453
- I like it.
- I thought you might.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.683
Hi, I'm Pam.

03:12.760 --> 03:14.088
You must be Kramer.

03:15.663 --> 03:18.926
Jerry has told me a lot about you.

03:20.167 --> 03:23.759
Well, I'm supposed to meet Jerry.
It's my day off.

03:24.071 --> 03:25.604
I work in a bookstore.

03:25.973 --> 03:27.938
Books.

03:29.443 --> 03:31.170
Careful.

03:33.647 --> 03:34.975
- Hi. Sorry I'm late.
- Hi.

03:35.049 --> 03:36.582
That's okay. Kramer let me in.

03:36.650 --> 03:38.615
If we rush,
we can still make the movie.

03:38.686 --> 03:41.016
It was really nice meeting you.

03:48.462 --> 03:49.790
I'm in trouble, buddy.

03:49.864 --> 03:51.295
I just met a woman.

03:51.365 --> 03:53.126
- Go on.
- Well...

03:54.235 --> 03:56.030
she's Jerry's girlfriend.

03:56.103 --> 03:58.569
Yes, forbidden love.

03:58.639 --> 04:00.536
She works in a bookshop.

04:00.608 --> 04:03.302
- Her name is Pam.
- Pam.

04:03.377 --> 04:06.810
I don't know the woman,
but she sounds quite fetching.

04:06.881 --> 04:09.347
I can't even speak in front of her.

04:09.417 --> 04:10.643
Jerry.

04:10.718 --> 04:13.787
What could she possibly see
in Jerry?

04:15.656 --> 04:17.485
She has delicate beauty.

04:17.558 --> 04:20.559
Jerry wouldn't know delicate
if it bludgeoned him over the head.

04:20.628 --> 04:23.561
And yet, he's my friend.

04:23.631 --> 04:25.824
And therein lies the tragedy.

04:25.900 --> 04:29.026
For I believe, sadly for you...

04:29.103 --> 04:32.434
that there is but one woman
meant for each of us.

04:32.506 --> 04:36.007
One perfect angel
for whom we are put on this earth.

04:36.077 --> 04:37.576
Oh, that's beautiful, Newman.

04:37.645 --> 04:39.645
One winsome tulip...

04:39.713 --> 04:44.773
we ceaselessly yearn for throughout
our dreary workaday lives...

04:44.852 --> 04:48.945
and you, my friend,
have found your angel.

04:49.023 --> 04:50.715
I can tell...

04:50.791 --> 04:54.691
for my heart has also been captured
by a breathless beauty...

04:54.762 --> 04:57.387
whom I fear I will never possess.

04:57.465 --> 04:59.465
I thought we were talking about me.

04:59.533 --> 05:01.533
Oh, right.

05:01.602 --> 05:03.897
Kramer, you have to confront Jerry.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.698
- Confront Jerry? I can't.
- You must.

05:05.773 --> 05:08.068
- I won't.
- You will.

05:08.142 --> 05:12.372
"Elaine, you gotta have a baby."

05:13.114 --> 05:14.806
Where are the poetry magazines?

05:14.882 --> 05:16.540
The New Yorker has poetry.

05:16.617 --> 05:18.947
Yes, The New Yorker.

05:19.019 --> 05:21.883
Why do you invite these women over
if they annoy you so much?

05:21.956 --> 05:23.284
Well, they're my friends...

05:23.357 --> 05:26.722
but they act as if having a baby
takes some kind of talent.

05:26.794 --> 05:28.589
Come on. You wanna have a baby.

05:28.662 --> 05:32.095
- Why? Because I can?
- It's the life force.

05:32.166 --> 05:34.063
I saw a show
on the mollusk last night.

05:34.135 --> 05:36.726
Elaine, the mollusk travels
from Alaska to Chile...

05:36.804 --> 05:38.667
just for a shot at another mollusk.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.067
You think you're any better?

05:40.141 --> 05:43.472
Yes, I think I am better
than the mollusk.

05:43.544 --> 05:46.306
Excuse me, I couldn't help
overhearing what you were saying.

05:46.380 --> 05:48.971
- Oh, I'm sorry...
- No, no, I think I agree with you.

05:49.049 --> 05:51.515
I mean, all this talk
about having babies.

05:51.585 --> 05:53.312
Yeah, like you must procreate.

05:53.387 --> 05:55.148
Besides, anyone can do it.

05:55.222 --> 05:57.449
Oh, it's been done to death.

05:59.426 --> 06:02.188
I should have a poem
very soon now.

06:02.263 --> 06:04.558
Are you okay, George?

06:04.632 --> 06:05.994
No, no.

06:06.734 --> 06:08.563
Not really.

06:09.737 --> 06:14.934
Ever since Susan passed on,
I have good days and bad.

06:15.743 --> 06:19.904
Some days I'm haunted
by one word:

06:19.980 --> 06:21.672
Why?

06:21.782 --> 06:23.782
Why Susan?

06:24.451 --> 06:28.248
Why wasn't it me
licking those invitations?

06:28.722 --> 06:30.881
Why am I still here?

06:32.760 --> 06:34.589
But I gotta run.

06:42.102 --> 06:45.330
Now, the stock options
for this year look quite...

06:53.214 --> 06:55.043
Briefcase.

06:58.719 --> 07:01.049
So, Kevin, if I don't want children...

07:01.121 --> 07:03.416
does that make me
a bad humanitarian?

07:03.490 --> 07:05.717
- Not at all.
- Because when you get to know me...

07:05.793 --> 07:08.191
you'll see that I'm
a pretty good humanitarian.

07:08.262 --> 07:11.195
You are doing a wonderful job,
by the way.

07:11.265 --> 07:14.334
- Thanks a lot.
- Right? Am I right?

07:14.568 --> 07:19.662
Kramer, Kramer, come here,
look at my new friend Kevin.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.668
Oh, you got a little...

07:23.077 --> 07:24.542
- You got...
- Oh, yeah.

07:24.612 --> 07:27.510
I just had two
double-fudge sundaes.

07:27.581 --> 07:29.342
Oh, are you all right?

07:29.416 --> 07:31.177
Yeah, I'll be okay.

07:32.286 --> 07:35.753
You know, Jerry has one of those
every time he bombs on stage.

07:35.823 --> 07:38.187
I'm sure he'll be sharing
his next one with Pam.

07:38.259 --> 07:39.758
Oh, no, that won't last.

07:39.827 --> 07:41.918
- What do you mean?
- He's not gaga.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.462
Let me tell you. That Jerry Lewis...

07:51.538 --> 07:53.367
you wonder how people
get to the top?

07:53.474 --> 07:55.872
It's ideas like this. Brilliant.

07:56.877 --> 07:58.569
Look at this.
What the hell happened?

07:58.646 --> 08:03.877
The whole side is damaged here,
and the lock is broken.

08:03.951 --> 08:06.246
- How long did you leave it there?
- Five minutes.

08:06.453 --> 08:07.781
What the hell happened here?

08:07.855 --> 08:10.446
Play the tape.
Maybe we'll get a clue.

08:11.292 --> 08:13.587
I have to rewind it first.

08:15.000 --> 08:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:31.412 --> 08:33.139
All right. All right.

08:33.212 --> 08:35.804
Did anyone notice
George's fingernails?

08:35.883 --> 08:40.477
Oh, my, yes, they look like
they were eaten away by weevils.

08:40.554 --> 08:43.748
It's kind of hot in here.
Open the window.

08:44.425 --> 08:46.152
Hey, what are you doing?

08:46.226 --> 08:48.726
Dear God!

08:51.932 --> 08:53.260
Is that it?

08:53.901 --> 08:56.492
- It stopped dead.
- What do you make of it?

08:57.171 --> 08:58.932
I don't know.

08:59.940 --> 09:02.270
Jerry, can we talk?

09:02.343 --> 09:03.671
Kind of busy here.

09:03.744 --> 09:07.041
- I'd like to talk to Jerry in private.
- Why can't I stay?

09:07.114 --> 09:08.841
Because it doesn't concern you.

09:08.916 --> 09:11.951
Well, if it doesn't concern me,
then I can stay.

09:21.362 --> 09:23.623
- So, what's on your mind?
- It's Pam.

09:23.697 --> 09:26.027
- Pam? What about Pam?
- I love her, Jerry.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.567
- You what?
- I love her.

09:28.635 --> 09:32.034
- Is that right?
- Oh, she's... She's real.

09:32.106 --> 09:35.664
She can bring home the bacon
and fry it in the pan.

09:36.110 --> 09:39.543
- What does that mean?
- Oh, and that voice.

09:39.613 --> 09:43.205
- What about her name?
- Pam? Oh, it's a beautiful name.

09:44.017 --> 09:45.709
Pam.

09:46.120 --> 09:47.983
Pam?

09:48.422 --> 09:50.183
Pam!

09:50.858 --> 09:53.290
- She's got really nice hair.
- Oh, it's incredible.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.451
Although, I might replace
her tortoise clip...

09:55.529 --> 09:58.325
with one of those velvet scrunchies.
I love those.

09:58.532 --> 10:00.190
You've got really specific tastes.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.766
Oh, I know what I want, Jerry.

10:02.169 --> 10:03.566
She got nice calves.

10:03.637 --> 10:07.366
Oh, she's a dreamboat,
but you don't like her.

10:07.441 --> 10:09.566
Maybe I could.
You're making some good points.

10:09.643 --> 10:11.643
- No, you can't, Jerry.
- But I might.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.302
- Oh, no, you don't.
- Why not?

10:13.380 --> 10:15.311
- The voice, the calves, the bacon.
- What?

10:15.382 --> 10:18.246
I think I can.
I even like the name Pam.

10:18.318 --> 10:19.680
Pam. Pam.

10:31.832 --> 10:33.593
So now he wants her
more than ever.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.132
Blast.

10:36.170 --> 10:37.601
What am I gonna do, huh?

10:37.671 --> 10:40.171
Don't despair, my friend.

10:42.709 --> 10:47.041
I won't allow your love
to go unrequited, not like mine.

10:47.114 --> 10:48.613
What, again with you?

10:48.682 --> 10:50.010
Sorry.

10:50.083 --> 10:53.084
But love is a spice
with many tastes...

10:53.153 --> 10:58.122
a dizzying array of textures
and moments.

10:59.059 --> 11:01.389
If only I could say things like that
around her.

11:01.462 --> 11:03.723
Yes.

11:04.965 --> 11:07.056
Well, I hear three distinct sounds:

11:07.134 --> 11:09.065
A low rumple...

11:09.136 --> 11:11.830
followed by a metallic squink...

11:11.905 --> 11:13.836
Yes, yes, I heard the squink.

11:13.907 --> 11:17.909
Followed by a mysterious galonk.

11:18.378 --> 11:20.742
It's a real baffler, isn't it?

11:20.814 --> 11:23.439
Well, one question
does come to mind.

11:24.985 --> 11:30.682
Have you considered just asking them
what happened to the briefcase?

11:31.492 --> 11:32.820
They would never tell me.

11:33.293 --> 11:36.226
First of all, they probably think
that I killed Susan.

11:36.296 --> 11:38.864
Besides, I don't even think
they like me.

11:38.932 --> 11:41.432
That Pam. I am gaga over her.

11:41.502 --> 11:43.001
"Gaga"? When did that happen?

11:43.070 --> 11:45.502
Yesterday, 6-ish.

11:46.740 --> 11:50.037
Well, maybe we should double.
I'm pretty gaga myself.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.837
You just met the guy yesterday.

11:51.912 --> 11:53.604
Yeah, but we have a common goal.

11:53.680 --> 11:57.011
A barren, sterile existence
that ends when you die?

11:58.218 --> 12:00.047
Yeah.

12:00.721 --> 12:02.846
You believe this guy
doesn't wanna have kids?

12:02.923 --> 12:05.685
- Yeah, of course.
- A guy will say anything to a woman.

12:05.759 --> 12:07.690
Oh, please, he wouldn't say that.

12:07.761 --> 12:11.024
Elaine, I once told a woman
that I coined the phrase:

12:11.098 --> 12:12.529
"Pardon my French."

12:14.868 --> 12:18.904
I once told a woman I don't eat cake
because it goes right to my thighs.

12:20.474 --> 12:24.032
Once told a woman
I enjoy spending time with my family.

12:27.247 --> 12:31.113
Your looks and my words
will have built the perfect beast.

12:31.184 --> 12:32.808
All right.

12:41.028 --> 12:44.564
- Oh, hi, Kramer.
- Hi, how are you?

12:44.631 --> 12:46.699
Hi, how are you?

12:47.334 --> 12:49.595
- I'm great.
- I too am well.

12:49.670 --> 12:51.499
I too am well.

12:52.739 --> 12:55.569
- Do I smell Pantene?
- Do I smell...?

12:56.310 --> 12:57.900
- Pantene!
- Pantene?

12:59.112 --> 13:00.907
Oh, my shampoo.

13:00.981 --> 13:02.673
Yeah, yeah, you know,
it is Pantene.

13:02.749 --> 13:05.283
I got a free sample of it
in with my junk mail.

13:05.352 --> 13:07.079
There really is no junk mail.

13:07.154 --> 13:09.222
Everybody wants a check
or birthday card...

13:09.289 --> 13:12.790
It requires just as much manpower
to deliver as their precious cards...

13:12.859 --> 13:15.086
Newman.

13:15.162 --> 13:16.889
What?

13:17.798 --> 13:19.126
Human. Human.

13:19.199 --> 13:23.702
It's human to be moved
by a fragrance.

13:23.770 --> 13:25.132
That's so true.

13:25.205 --> 13:28.570
Her bouquet cleaved his hardened...

13:28.642 --> 13:30.869
- Shell.
- Shell

13:30.944 --> 13:34.377
And fondled his muscled heart

13:35.215 --> 13:38.148
He imbibed her glistening spell

13:38.218 --> 13:42.311
Just before the other shoe fell

13:42.789 --> 13:44.982
Kramer, that is so lovely.

13:45.325 --> 13:49.293
It's by an unknown
20th century poet.

13:49.363 --> 13:52.489
- Oh, what's him name?
- Newman.

13:55.202 --> 13:58.100
Elaine, you changed my life.

13:58.171 --> 14:02.833
Oh, Kevin, you can go on and on
about how you don't want kids...

14:02.909 --> 14:05.375
and it sounds...
It sounds really nice...

14:05.445 --> 14:09.948
but the truth is, I don't know
if you mean it or not.

14:10.017 --> 14:12.142
I got a vasectomy this morning.

14:13.787 --> 14:16.913
Although, I have a hunch
you mean it.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.691
I just came by to tell you...

14:20.761 --> 14:25.992
I'm really, really happy
about this relationship. Really happy.

14:26.066 --> 14:30.296
Oh, well, that's nice.

14:34.341 --> 14:36.272
A velvet scrunchie.

14:38.612 --> 14:40.202
Kramer.

14:46.253 --> 14:47.786
Hello, Newman.

14:48.021 --> 14:49.645
Hello, Jerry.

14:49.723 --> 14:51.051
How's Pam?

14:51.124 --> 14:53.454
Pam? What do you care?

14:57.097 --> 14:58.789
Well, ta-ta.

14:59.833 --> 15:01.992
Wait a minute.

15:29.996 --> 15:31.723
All right, Newman, this is it.

15:31.798 --> 15:33.092
Steady, Jerry.

15:33.166 --> 15:35.860
Steady. Wouldn't wanna
lose your cool at a time like this.

15:35.936 --> 15:38.334
- Why not?
- Because right now...

15:38.405 --> 15:40.973
I'm the only chance you've got.

15:44.845 --> 15:45.934
Come on.

15:48.682 --> 15:50.807
I can't believe I'm losing Pam.

15:50.884 --> 15:52.508
I know how you feel...

15:52.586 --> 15:54.950
for I too have a woman
for whom I pine.

15:55.021 --> 15:57.954
- I thought we were talking about me.
- Right.

15:58.024 --> 16:00.092
Anyway, I don't need your help.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.125
Oh, don't you, joke boy?

16:03.764 --> 16:06.765
You really think you can manipulate
that beautiful young woman...

16:06.833 --> 16:09.424
Iike the half-soused,
nightclub rabble...

16:09.503 --> 16:13.039
that lap up your inane
"observations"?

16:14.107 --> 16:15.504
All right, Newman.

16:15.575 --> 16:18.269
What do I to get you to stop
pulling strings for Kramer?

16:18.345 --> 16:21.380
Well, there is a little something
you can do for me.

16:21.448 --> 16:22.810
Come on, out with it.

16:22.883 --> 16:25.417
It's about Elaine.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.109
Elaine? What does she have to...?

16:28.789 --> 16:31.449
Oh, no.

16:32.425 --> 16:34.857
You dated her.
Give me some inside information.

16:34.928 --> 16:36.586
Anything I can use.

16:36.863 --> 16:38.794
Well, I know she doesn't
wanna have kids.

16:42.002 --> 16:45.128
I thought you'd be
a little more enthusiastic about it.

16:45.572 --> 16:49.938
I know. I don't want... kids.

16:50.010 --> 16:52.305
- What was that?
- Well...

16:52.379 --> 16:54.174
Kevin, maybe I have a little doubt.

16:54.247 --> 16:56.315
I mean, nothing is 100 percent.

16:56.383 --> 16:58.348
This is.

16:58.885 --> 17:02.182
- Oh, boy, I always do this.
- What?

17:02.255 --> 17:05.722
I get all jazzed up about something,
and I go way too far with it.

17:05.791 --> 17:07.189
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

17:07.260 --> 17:10.796
Like last summer, I'm watching TV
and I saw one of those jet skis.

17:11.832 --> 17:14.594
Four thousand dollars later,
and it's sitting in my garage.

17:14.667 --> 17:17.999
You know, that's weird actually,
because I'm sort of the same way.

17:18.070 --> 17:21.766
I mean, once for, like, no reason,
I flattened my hair...

17:21.842 --> 17:25.673
and I had all these strands
hanging in my face all the time.

17:25.744 --> 17:29.941
Sometimes I think I do want kids,
maybe a lot of kids.

17:30.016 --> 17:33.017
Sometimes I think about
wearing my hair real short.

17:33.086 --> 17:37.384
Yeah, I think I like short hair,
really short.

17:37.457 --> 17:39.184
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

17:43.263 --> 17:47.527
This is a crude mock-up
of the conference room.

17:47.601 --> 17:49.168
One-fourteenth scale.

17:49.402 --> 17:50.867
When did you build this thing?

17:50.937 --> 17:53.267
Yesterday. Took the day off.

17:53.773 --> 17:58.401
Now, from the time
that I left the room...

17:58.478 --> 18:00.705
- Wait. That's you?
- Yeah.

18:01.014 --> 18:02.843
I think the M&M should be you.

18:09.122 --> 18:11.053
All right, whatever.

18:11.658 --> 18:15.626
Now, whatever caused
the damage...

18:15.695 --> 18:20.061
it was jarring enough
to completely stop the tape.

18:20.133 --> 18:22.997
- And?
- Okay.

18:23.069 --> 18:25.364
That's what we know.

18:25.939 --> 18:28.735
- But we already knew that.
- Well, yeah.

18:28.808 --> 18:31.900
Just give me some idea
what you think it could be.

18:32.212 --> 18:34.780
- I don't know if you're ready for it.
- Please.

18:35.282 --> 18:39.546
I believe that I'm about
to become the target...

18:39.619 --> 18:42.984
of a systematic process
of intimidation and manipulation...

18:43.056 --> 18:46.353
- the likes of which...
- Hold it. You're right. I'm not ready.

18:49.329 --> 18:50.657
- Yeah?
- It's Pam.

18:50.730 --> 18:53.560
Come on up. All right, it's Pam.
You gotta get going.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.200
I'm not through here, Jerry.

18:55.268 --> 18:57.393
I'm gonna keep on investigating.

18:57.737 --> 18:59.202
This thing is like an onion.

18:59.272 --> 19:03.775
The more layers you peel,
the more it stinks.

19:08.415 --> 19:09.812
What was that?

19:09.883 --> 19:11.951
We were just playing.

19:13.520 --> 19:16.088
Listen, I had a long talk
with Kramer today.

19:17.057 --> 19:21.218
Well, the thing is l...
I think I have a little crush on him.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.090
I'm so happy.

19:24.164 --> 19:26.129
My world suddenly has meaning.

19:26.199 --> 19:28.324
This is the man
you have a crush on?

19:28.401 --> 19:30.469
Well, I have feelings for both of you.

19:30.537 --> 19:32.571
You have feelings for him?
We're soul mates.

19:32.639 --> 19:34.400
Why can't I be a soul mate?

19:34.474 --> 19:38.305
Jerry, you really think Pam would want
you to be the father of her children?

19:38.378 --> 19:39.809
Children?

19:39.879 --> 19:42.812
Who said anything about children?
I don't wanna have children.

19:46.453 --> 19:47.986
There are people in this room...

19:48.054 --> 19:53.114
who would've been very happy
to never see this briefcase again.

19:53.827 --> 19:55.360
There are people in this room...

19:55.428 --> 19:58.088
who think they can destroy
other people's property...

19:58.164 --> 19:59.993
and get away with it.

20:00.433 --> 20:02.797
Well, let me tell you something
about those people.

20:02.869 --> 20:05.494
They weren't
counting on this brain...

20:06.272 --> 20:08.340
and this tape recorder.

20:08.408 --> 20:10.032
- George...
- You'll have your turn.

20:12.779 --> 20:15.973
The truth must be heard.

20:16.049 --> 20:17.548
Hey, what are you doing?

20:17.851 --> 20:19.509
Dear God!

20:23.156 --> 20:24.780
That's all there was...

20:24.858 --> 20:28.689
and yet it speaks volumes.

20:29.162 --> 20:31.196
A low rumple...

20:31.831 --> 20:34.195
a metallic squink...

20:34.667 --> 20:36.735
a galonk...

20:36.803 --> 20:40.395
and someone crying out,
"Dear God!"

20:42.175 --> 20:46.905
Let's start with... With you, Wyck.

20:49.149 --> 20:52.548
George, Quinn here
was moving a chair.

20:52.619 --> 20:54.584
He lost his balance and dropped it.

20:54.654 --> 20:56.483
It must have fallen
on your briefcase...

20:56.556 --> 21:00.183
which, for some reason,
contained a running tape recorder.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.429
All right then.

21:10.236 --> 21:12.634
We've gotten to the bottom of that.

21:19.512 --> 21:20.909
What are you guys doing here?

21:20.980 --> 21:22.741
We're getting vasectomies.

21:24.284 --> 21:26.875
- Why?
- I'm doing it for you.

21:27.754 --> 21:29.879
- What?
- What did you do to your hair?

21:30.356 --> 21:31.923
I cut it.

21:31.991 --> 21:33.353
It's a little short.

21:33.426 --> 21:35.016
You think?

21:36.963 --> 21:38.189
What are you doing here?

21:38.264 --> 21:40.423
Kevin's having
his vasectomy reversed.

21:40.500 --> 21:41.897
- Reversed?
- Reversed?

22:01.588 --> 22:04.851
He imbibed her glistening spell

22:05.525 --> 22:09.459
Just before the other shoe fell

22:13.233 --> 22:14.664
Is that a Keats poem?

22:14.734 --> 22:16.324
No, it's a Newman.

22:18.938 --> 22:20.596
Well, I gotta run.

22:28.481 --> 22:31.141
Does anyone think George
might have murdered Susan?

22:31.484 --> 22:34.610
Oh, yeah, I just assumed
he murdered her.

22:34.687 --> 22:37.620
- Of course he killed her.
- So it's not just me then.

22:37.924 --> 22:40.925
All right. Back to business.
