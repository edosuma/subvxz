My mother once told me

00:25.682 --> 00:29.451
being with a man takes
only a few minutes.

00:29.453 --> 00:31.652
Planting sweet
potatoes takes you

00:31.654 --> 00:35.424
all day bent over
in the burning sun.

In my country, the only way
a mother can save her child

00:58.081 --> 00:59.783
is by leaving him.

03:05.042 --> 03:06.176
I owe you one.

03:08.078 --> 03:08.913
Yes.

03:13.851 --> 03:17.785
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

03:17.787 --> 03:20.124
Yay, happy birthday!

03:22.025 --> 03:26.197
Happy, happy birthday and
you get to have the first cut.

03:27.597 --> 03:30.197
Okay, girls, pass
your plates down.

03:32.902 --> 03:34.839
Happy Birthday, Sara.

03:39.042 --> 03:41.775
Wow, you nail it every year.

03:41.777 --> 03:43.947
It's absolutely delicious.

03:45.716 --> 03:47.781
Honestly, Diane,
I never thought

03:47.783 --> 03:51.021
you would be here on
her 18th birthday.

03:52.722 --> 03:53.988
I know, I feel
really bad about that.

03:53.990 --> 03:55.025
I'm sorry.

03:55.959 --> 03:57.795
So what happens now?

03:58.995 --> 04:02.530
Sara, you've aged out of
foster care and the state law

04:02.532 --> 04:06.703
is that you have to leave
the group home tomorrow.

04:11.542 --> 04:13.708
You're still considered
a non-minor dependent

04:13.710 --> 04:15.543
for the next few
years and, with that,

04:15.545 --> 04:17.911
there could be one option.

04:17.914 --> 04:20.848
Well, why didn't
you start with that?

04:20.850 --> 04:24.020
Because you're not
going to like it.

04:30.224 --> 04:30.891
This is for both of us, right?

04:30.893 --> 04:32.162
Me and Natalie?

04:33.364 --> 04:36.064
Your sister can't be with
you until you can support her.

04:36.066 --> 04:37.732
No, I can't leave her behind.

04:37.734 --> 04:41.770
Do you have any idea how many
girls I see on the streets?

04:41.772 --> 04:46.273
Connected with gangs, pregnant,
hooked on drugs, drinking?

04:46.275 --> 04:48.275
Good kids, kids who
swear they would never

04:48.277 --> 04:49.177
do something like that.

04:49.179 --> 04:51.812
It happens like that!

04:51.814 --> 04:54.584
That's why we're
trying new ideas.

04:56.152 --> 04:59.086
I think maybe we need
to think about this, Sara.

04:59.088 --> 05:01.691
I mean you can't be homeless.

05:07.698 --> 05:10.101
When would I have to leave?

05:11.902 --> 05:13.237
Within a week.

05:14.638 --> 05:15.273
Oh God.

05:19.742 --> 05:23.110
You better do your dishes, okay?

05:23.112 --> 05:25.882
- Come, come Natalie.
- Bye Sara.

05:27.150 --> 05:30.384
Hey, this is a
blessing for Sara.

05:30.386 --> 05:35.256
She's off into the world
to live and grow in Texas.

05:35.258 --> 05:37.124
Texas is a great place.

05:37.126 --> 05:38.259
Have you been there before?

05:38.261 --> 05:39.960
Years ago.

05:39.962 --> 05:42.364
The Central Christian Church
had a symposium in Austin.

05:42.366 --> 05:44.633
In fact, I became
very good friends

05:44.635 --> 05:46.804
with a Father Davis there.

05:48.138 --> 05:51.138
I just need a quick
signature, please.

05:51.140 --> 05:54.811
The custodial parent
line indicating release.

05:58.849 --> 06:00.215
Our friends in Texas
are going to take

06:00.217 --> 06:03.220
really good care
of your big sister.

06:08.825 --> 06:12.026
Now, you call whenever
you want, all right.

06:12.028 --> 06:14.061
And, you know what,
if you're not happy,

06:14.063 --> 06:15.663
we're going to bring
you right home.

06:15.665 --> 06:16.299
Okay?

06:25.075 --> 06:25.910
Hey.

06:26.742 --> 06:28.311
Hey, hey, look at me.

06:31.414 --> 06:34.249
I promise I will be back.

06:45.761 --> 06:46.396
Sara!

06:51.301 --> 06:53.404
So mom can watch over you.

06:55.304 --> 06:57.007
Bye, I love you.

06:58.008 --> 06:58.842
Bye.

07:42.018 --> 07:44.184
Hey, you better come
visit me in Boston, huh.

07:44.186 --> 07:45.386
Are you mad?

07:45.388 --> 07:47.355
Two weeks of that winter and
you'll be on the first plane

07:47.357 --> 07:50.324
to San Francisco to visit me.

07:50.326 --> 07:51.391
Probably true.

07:51.393 --> 07:52.763
I know.

07:54.196 --> 07:55.028
Oh God.

07:55.030 --> 07:55.963
What?

07:57.299 --> 07:59.533
Aye, don't look nah.

07:59.535 --> 08:00.768
God, he's coming over here.

08:00.770 --> 08:02.273
Don't look at him.

08:03.140 --> 08:04.338
Hi, Amba.

08:04.340 --> 08:05.239
Want to dance?

08:05.241 --> 08:06.807
Don't touch me, Raj!

08:06.809 --> 08:08.109
Go away, Raj.

08:08.111 --> 08:09.244
Hey, watch your tongue.

08:09.246 --> 08:11.246
Asshole!

08:11.248 --> 08:12.347
Hey, stop it!

08:12.349 --> 08:13.280
Sanjay!

08:13.282 --> 08:15.816
Get this freak out of here!

08:15.818 --> 08:17.354
Mind your business!

08:29.332 --> 08:30.364
You okay?

08:30.366 --> 08:31.198
Yeah.

08:31.200 --> 08:32.033
You two okay?

08:32.034 --> 08:32.869
Yeah.

08:34.236 --> 08:36.270
Oh God,
Aarti, I'm so dead.

08:36.273 --> 08:38.938
Don't worry, babe,
I'll get you home by 11.

08:38.941 --> 08:40.241
You were supposed
to watch the time.

08:40.243 --> 08:41.145
I told you.

10:27.450 --> 10:29.453
Okay, beti, take this.

10:30.986 --> 10:32.319
Take this, you'll feel better.

10:32.321 --> 10:33.954
Come, come, come, come.

10:33.956 --> 10:35.555
Ah-huh, ah-huh.

10:35.557 --> 10:37.561
Good girl, there you go.

10:43.933 --> 10:44.567
Ow!

10:48.238 --> 10:49.437
Good girl, good girl.

10:49.439 --> 10:51.372
Ah-ha-ha-ha.

10:51.374 --> 10:52.442
There you go.

11:06.523 --> 11:07.358
It has AC.

11:13.495 --> 11:14.330
Aye!

11:15.465 --> 11:16.499
Stay.

11:19.536 --> 11:23.471
The Japanese man was waiting
for four days when you called.

11:23.473 --> 11:24.975
Just for a virgin.

11:26.242 --> 11:30.511
Your father sends too
many women abroad now.

11:30.513 --> 11:34.251
After the Japanese
man is done, I want her.

12:10.286 --> 12:11.121
Enjoy.

12:17.292 --> 12:19.229
Leave her with me only.

12:28.571 --> 12:29.672
What to do?

12:41.216 --> 12:42.549
No.

12:42.551 --> 12:43.387
No.

12:51.260 --> 12:52.095
No.

13:27.430 --> 13:30.464
It's your first time
on an airplane, right?

13:30.466 --> 13:31.665
Yeah.

13:31.667 --> 13:33.300
Well, you have a layover in
Phoenix and then when you get

13:33.302 --> 13:35.870
to Houston, it's a bit
of a drive to the coast.

13:35.872 --> 13:38.872
I think you girls
are gonna love it.

13:38.874 --> 13:39.740
Training's hard.

13:39.742 --> 13:41.409
I mean it's work, right?

13:41.411 --> 13:43.211
You'll have to adjust, but when
you're making all that money

13:43.213 --> 13:45.179
and you're sitting on the
beach watching the sunset,

13:45.181 --> 13:46.848
you won't even think about home.

13:46.850 --> 13:48.649
Can we have margaritas?

13:48.651 --> 13:50.117
Oh my God!

13:50.119 --> 13:52.719
Excuse me, excuse me.

13:52.721 --> 13:56.123
I'm a lot of fun but, you
know, not that much fun.

13:56.125 --> 13:57.592
I'm doing
the waitress training.

13:57.594 --> 13:59.227
Oh, I'm
doing that one too!

13:59.229 --> 14:00.761
Maybe we'll get to
work on the same ship?

14:00.763 --> 14:03.133
Yeah, I'm stoked.

14:04.834 --> 14:09.170
This seems like
a long way to the airport.

14:09.172 --> 14:11.675
Why are you stopping?

14:14.210 --> 14:15.142
Diane?

14:15.144 --> 14:16.444
Come on, girls, out you go.

14:16.446 --> 14:17.281
Hey guys.

14:18.748 --> 14:20.647
This is Dave and Felix
and they are here

14:20.649 --> 14:22.750
to take you to the
great state of Texas.

14:22.752 --> 14:24.618
What you got for me?

14:24.620 --> 14:25.553
A little somethin', somethin'.

14:25.555 --> 14:27.521
I love seeing you.

14:27.523 --> 14:28.356
Diane?

14:28.358 --> 14:29.256
So these are them?

14:29.258 --> 14:30.157
Yeah.

14:30.159 --> 14:31.391
Looking good.

14:31.393 --> 14:32.626
Diane, why
aren't you taking us?

14:32.628 --> 14:33.895
Honey, I can't take
that much time off work

14:33.897 --> 14:35.596
and, I'm sorry I didn't
have time to tell you

14:35.598 --> 14:38.198
every little detail, but these
gentlemen are my colleagues

14:38.200 --> 14:39.567
from Children and
Family Services

14:39.569 --> 14:41.269
and they're here to
get you to Texas.

14:41.271 --> 14:41.868
I, I...

14:41.870 --> 14:43.304
I wanna go back.

14:43.306 --> 14:43.905
I think
I'll go back too.

14:43.907 --> 14:45.606
Yeah, me too.

14:45.608 --> 14:46.674
Come on, ladies,
the flight leaves soon.

14:46.676 --> 14:48.476
We need to go now.

14:48.478 --> 14:49.410
I'd rather just...

14:49.412 --> 14:50.477
I think I'm gonna go back too.

14:50.479 --> 14:51.679
Look, guys, if you're not
going to take me back,

14:51.681 --> 14:52.813
I'm just gonna walk.

14:52.815 --> 14:54.515
Get her!

14:54.517 --> 14:55.815
Oh, to hell with this!

14:55.817 --> 14:56.650
Hey!

14:59.388 --> 15:00.887
Help, somebody help her!

15:00.889 --> 15:03.558
Hell, girl, shut up!

15:03.560 --> 15:05.793
All right, that's
it, on the ground!

15:05.795 --> 15:07.527
Hurry up, Felix!

15:07.529 --> 15:08.396
What have you got there?

15:08.398 --> 15:09.296
No, no!

15:09.298 --> 15:11.134
Give me that!

15:11.901 --> 15:13.534
What have you got, girl?

15:13.536 --> 15:14.367
I don't know.

15:14.369 --> 15:16.771
Let me see.

15:16.773 --> 15:17.704
You know what?

15:17.706 --> 15:18.606
You two are just ridiculous.

15:18.608 --> 15:20.741
Can't really fly with
them now, can you?

15:20.743 --> 15:21.842
They're your girls.

15:21.844 --> 15:22.809
Take them in the truck.

15:22.811 --> 15:23.777
All the way?

15:23.779 --> 15:25.746
Yes, all the
way, you fucking, moron.

15:25.748 --> 15:27.280
Just teach them a
good lesson first.

15:27.282 --> 15:29.753
Diane, why are you doing this?

15:30.920 --> 15:33.457
It's just business, honey.

15:50.373 --> 15:51.642
Get up!

16:03.720 --> 16:04.521
Ah!

16:53.735 --> 16:54.801
Sorry!

16:54.803 --> 16:58.405
Nothing to be
sorry for, my dear.

16:58.407 --> 16:59.973
Sleep as long as you want.

16:59.975 --> 17:00.811
Huh.

17:14.323 --> 17:16.757
Where are we going?

17:16.759 --> 17:18.996
Probably across the border.

17:21.496 --> 17:22.798
Don't worry, dear.

17:23.832 --> 17:25.401
Mali is here, okay?

17:26.336 --> 17:28.501
What's your name?

17:28.502 --> 17:29.505
It's Amba.

17:30.406 --> 17:31.041
Amba.

17:32.742 --> 17:34.541
This is Nelson.

17:34.543 --> 17:35.378
My boy.

17:37.580 --> 17:39.813
Where are you from?

17:39.815 --> 17:40.650
India.

17:41.951 --> 17:44.484
Me, I'm from Nigeria.

17:44.486 --> 17:48.621
I've been all over the
place the last five years.

17:48.623 --> 17:50.090
Five years?

17:50.092 --> 17:52.827
It took me two
months just to walk

17:52.829 --> 17:55.695
from Nigeria to Morocco.

17:55.697 --> 17:58.699
Most of the time
I was in London.

17:58.701 --> 18:01.601
They have the best
slang words there.

18:01.603 --> 18:04.003
My favorite is bugger.

18:04.005 --> 18:04.940
Bugger you.

18:05.841 --> 18:06.743
Bugger off!

18:07.609 --> 18:09.012
Buggering bugger!

18:10.012 --> 18:12.445
I love that word.

18:12.447 --> 18:16.619
I can't do this for five more
days, let alone five years.

18:18.053 --> 18:20.423
There has to be a way out.

18:21.757 --> 18:24.858
There's no way out
unless they give it to you.

18:24.860 --> 18:25.826
They did.

18:25.828 --> 18:27.027
Look, right here.

18:27.029 --> 18:31.100
They said 6,000 Euro was my
debt and then I could go home.

18:32.702 --> 18:35.539
Next thing you
know I'm in Mexico.

18:36.406 --> 18:37.907
Now, what do I do?

18:39.041 --> 18:41.477
You lie back and survive.

18:42.878 --> 18:45.713
We'll get through it, okay?

18:45.715 --> 18:46.550
I promise.

19:22.584 --> 19:25.653
Well, Gretel was
terrified of the old woman.

19:25.655 --> 19:28.755
Every day she brought Hansel
water and lots of good food

19:28.757 --> 19:32.059
to eat and each day the old
woman went to Hansel's stall

19:32.061 --> 19:34.060
and told him to stick
out one of his fingers

19:34.062 --> 19:36.597
so she could feel if
he was growing plump.

19:36.599 --> 19:39.532
And each day, Hansel
had a bone instead...

19:39.534 --> 19:40.768
Hey boss.

19:40.770 --> 19:43.673
Don't interrupt
me when I'm reading.

19:46.708 --> 19:47.774
What the fuck is this?

19:47.776 --> 19:50.845
They said one of the
blacks got sick in Reynosa.

19:50.847 --> 19:51.915
Goddamn it.

19:52.948 --> 19:54.949
You two even speak English?

19:54.951 --> 19:55.786
Yes.

19:56.752 --> 19:58.219
Good.

19:58.221 --> 20:00.753
Well, this is a special
place we got here.

20:00.755 --> 20:02.490
We pride ourselves
with having the largest

20:02.492 --> 20:04.825
international selection
of women in the state.

20:04.827 --> 20:06.993
Men come from all around.

20:06.995 --> 20:10.964
We help them make a
map, you understand?

20:10.966 --> 20:13.233
You both owe me 500 men.

20:13.235 --> 20:16.736
When you with them,
you smile, enjoy it.

20:16.738 --> 20:18.071
If you don't enjoy it, lie.

20:18.073 --> 20:20.206
Make 'em think you enjoying it.

20:20.208 --> 20:21.876
After 500, you're
free to fuck off

20:21.878 --> 20:23.176
or you could stick around,
you make some cash.

20:23.178 --> 20:25.047
How does that sound?

20:26.081 --> 20:28.816
We work seven days
a week, all right?

20:28.818 --> 20:31.985
There's cameras everywhere
so don't do anything stupid.

20:31.987 --> 20:34.187
You just obey the rules
and we're gonna get along.

20:34.189 --> 20:35.923
All right?

20:35.925 --> 20:37.992
You break 'em, I'm
gonna break you.

20:37.994 --> 20:40.059
Get your ass back here!

20:40.061 --> 20:41.095
What the?

20:41.097 --> 20:42.930
Simon, look at this shit!

20:42.932 --> 20:44.130
Goddamn it!

20:44.132 --> 20:45.265
Hey!

20:45.267 --> 20:47.033
Hey!

20:51.873 --> 20:53.007
Max!

20:53.009 --> 20:53.840
Kate!

20:53.842 --> 20:54.476
Now!

20:55.844 --> 20:58.578
All right, you just went to 505.

20:58.580 --> 21:01.014
Max, put that on the ledger.

21:01.016 --> 21:02.985
Jenna, take 'em down.

21:05.186 --> 21:06.223
She's a fool.

21:10.192 --> 21:11.995
Welcome to Texas.

21:18.634 --> 21:21.734
I'm gonna die in this place.

21:21.736 --> 21:24.104
Just do what they say.

21:24.106 --> 21:26.173
If we survive long enough,
they'll let us out.

21:26.175 --> 21:27.711
After 500 men.

21:33.782 --> 21:36.049
It's okay, okay?

21:36.051 --> 21:39.086
Just remember what
my mum once told me.

21:39.088 --> 21:42.121
Being with a man takes
you a few minutes,

21:42.123 --> 21:44.192
planting sweet potatoes
takes you all day

21:45.224 --> 21:46.662
bent over in the burning sun.

21:51.833 --> 21:53.202
Let's see here.

21:54.637 --> 21:58.004
Simon says you're going
to be in Room Number Nine

21:58.006 --> 21:59.239
and Room Number 10.

21:59.241 --> 22:00.874
You're gonna share a bathroom.

22:00.876 --> 22:01.510
Hmm?

22:03.145 --> 22:06.146
Something not right about you.

22:06.148 --> 22:08.014
What do you mean?

22:08.016 --> 22:09.151
You're Romani.

22:10.919 --> 22:12.086
My ancestors.

22:12.088 --> 22:13.620
Yeah so, so what?

22:13.622 --> 22:15.888
Don't listen to
anything this one says.

22:15.890 --> 22:17.825
His people are Gypsies.

22:17.827 --> 22:19.760
They're dangerous.

22:19.762 --> 22:21.598
So says the African.

22:24.199 --> 22:27.233
And that prat over there,
she's no good either.

22:27.235 --> 22:28.801
Russian, I believe.

22:28.803 --> 22:30.771
Mm-hmm, Nella.

22:30.773 --> 22:33.339
And the girl next
to her is Milena.

22:33.341 --> 22:36.644
They stay here after
their debt to Simon.

22:36.646 --> 22:38.815
They make their own money.

22:40.750 --> 22:42.986
Ladies, let's line it up.

22:44.153 --> 22:45.689
Close 'em, guys.

22:51.359 --> 22:52.628
Hi, compadre.

22:54.096 --> 22:54.931
Set me up.

23:33.903 --> 23:35.372
Open, come on, open.

23:37.005 --> 23:38.307
Come on, open 'em.

24:15.043 --> 24:17.444
I'm not
talking to you anymore!

24:17.446 --> 24:19.346
Just stop talking to me!

24:19.348 --> 24:20.414
Tell the truth!

24:20.416 --> 24:23.285
Just don't touch them!

24:25.454 --> 24:26.289
Mommy!

24:32.261 --> 24:34.528
Go, run to Chucky!

24:34.530 --> 24:35.462
Mommy!

24:35.464 --> 24:36.963
Run as fast as you can!

24:36.965 --> 24:38.932
You take care of your
sister, do you hear me?

24:38.934 --> 24:40.099
Don't you ever forget that!

24:40.101 --> 24:41.934
Why is he doing this?

24:44.974 --> 24:46.839
Don't come back!

24:46.841 --> 24:48.942
You ain't ever
leaving me, bitch!

24:48.944 --> 24:50.213
You understand?

24:56.351 --> 24:57.451
Go!

24:57.453 --> 24:59.289
Get back here, Sara!

25:00.923 --> 25:01.555
Sara!

25:17.973 --> 25:20.007
All right, be still.

25:20.009 --> 25:21.444
Let me get at it.

25:29.185 --> 25:30.352
Just be still.

25:31.419 --> 25:33.789
I'm trying to be delicate.

25:47.069 --> 25:50.373
You gotta promise me,
you're gonna behave.

25:54.443 --> 25:55.478
All right.

26:02.217 --> 26:03.485
Get some sleep.

26:38.387 --> 26:40.354
All right, let's
go, come on, get up!

26:40.356 --> 26:42.125
Jenna, hey, get up!

26:43.024 --> 26:44.390
Come on!

26:44.392 --> 26:46.495
Chili, open up, let's go!

26:47.596 --> 26:49.363
Milena, come on!

26:49.365 --> 26:50.530
Rise and shine!

26:50.532 --> 26:51.367
Sara!

26:52.434 --> 26:53.235
Let's go!

26:55.536 --> 26:57.306
Aye, come on, get up!

26:59.108 --> 27:00.109
Hey, get up!

27:05.080 --> 27:07.149
Come on, Nella, let's go!

27:14.523 --> 27:15.621
Let's go, Sara.

27:15.623 --> 27:16.992
Got to get up.

27:23.365 --> 27:24.267
Yo, get up!

27:25.434 --> 27:28.905
Mali, come on, up
and at 'em, let's go!

27:52.561 --> 27:53.596
Hi, I'm Mali.

27:55.464 --> 27:56.532
This is Amba.

27:57.465 --> 27:59.366
I'm Sara.

27:59.368 --> 28:01.335
Where are you from?

28:01.337 --> 28:03.036
California.

28:03.038 --> 28:04.474
Wow, Hollywood.

28:06.341 --> 28:07.607
I love that bloke.

28:07.609 --> 28:08.945
What's his name?

28:10.579 --> 28:11.481
Fresh Prince.

28:13.349 --> 28:14.614
You mean Will Smith?

28:14.616 --> 28:17.117
Yes, that's the one.

28:17.119 --> 28:18.484
I guess they
show pretty old TV shows

28:18.486 --> 28:19.752
where you're from.

28:19.754 --> 28:21.521
Nigeria?

28:21.523 --> 28:23.493
Yeah, maybe, I don't know.

28:25.194 --> 28:27.527
This one's from India.

28:27.529 --> 28:29.562
How far away is that?

28:29.564 --> 28:32.699
Two planes, three
trucks, one speedboat

28:32.701 --> 28:35.135
and one wooden rowboat.

28:35.137 --> 28:38.472
And, look, some boy
threw poison on her

28:38.474 --> 28:41.640
because she refused
to be his girlfriend.

28:41.642 --> 28:44.246
Beastly, ugly, wanker, I bet.

28:46.482 --> 28:48.749
When did you get here?

28:48.751 --> 28:51.684
A few days ago, I think.

28:51.686 --> 28:53.723
I love your pretty bow.

28:57.392 --> 28:58.759
It's from my mama.

28:58.761 --> 29:02.128
Oh, then it's got good juju.

29:02.130 --> 29:03.496
Good what?

29:03.498 --> 29:04.798
Juju.

29:04.800 --> 29:06.502
It's like spirits.

29:07.636 --> 29:10.604
Good juju keeps you
safe when trouble comes.

29:10.606 --> 29:13.406
You mean like
a guardian angel?

29:13.408 --> 29:17.411
Yes, if it's good
juju like hers is.

29:17.413 --> 29:19.678
Bad juju not so much.

29:19.680 --> 29:22.648
How can it be good
juju if she's here?

29:22.650 --> 29:24.553
She's alive, isn't she?

29:31.459 --> 29:33.128
Pour it slow, Gypsy.

29:34.329 --> 29:35.796
Amba.

29:35.798 --> 29:37.667
I just prefer tea.

29:39.068 --> 29:42.601
Hey, what is that horn
in the middle of the night?

29:42.603 --> 29:44.337
The train.

29:44.339 --> 29:47.139
There's a freight line just
about a mile north of here.

29:47.141 --> 29:50.210
That early train only comes
by Mondays and Fridays.

29:50.212 --> 29:52.279
Is there a station?

29:52.281 --> 29:55.816
It's more of a depot
nearby a truck stop.

29:55.818 --> 29:58.654
Sometimes Simon
sends girls there.

30:00.722 --> 30:02.521
Hey baby.

30:02.523 --> 30:04.092
Give me a minute.

30:28.716 --> 30:30.649
Rob, move them in.

30:33.621 --> 30:35.624
Mali, I can't do this.

30:36.524 --> 30:38.258
One step at a time.

30:38.260 --> 30:41.627
Walk up there with me and
we pray they don't pick you.

30:41.629 --> 30:43.797
I'm not sure
praying will help.

30:43.799 --> 30:45.831
Let's go, let's go!

30:45.833 --> 30:46.765
Let's go.

30:46.767 --> 30:48.703
Let's go.

30:53.609 --> 30:54.808
Woo-wee!

30:54.810 --> 30:56.510
All right, ladies, I
want to see you all

30:56.512 --> 30:58.211
in a tight, little row.

30:58.213 --> 30:59.115
Go on, now.

31:01.884 --> 31:02.819
Mm, mm, mm.

31:03.685 --> 31:05.751
Turn round for me, baby.

31:05.753 --> 31:06.789
No.

31:07.755 --> 31:09.623
Hey, you miss me?

31:09.625 --> 31:10.557
I did.

31:10.559 --> 31:11.424
That new?

31:11.426 --> 31:12.259
It is.

31:12.261 --> 31:13.262
I like it.

31:14.228 --> 31:16.195
I don't think so.

31:16.197 --> 31:17.532
Hi, next time.

31:23.539 --> 31:24.807
Where you from?

31:26.742 --> 31:27.577
Okay.

31:29.711 --> 31:30.546
Hey, mama.

31:31.780 --> 31:32.615
Mm.

31:35.449 --> 31:36.686
Well, you're new.

31:37.653 --> 31:38.654
You're cute.

31:40.821 --> 31:42.289
Hmm.

31:42.291 --> 31:45.461
And you have seen
way too much action.

31:48.830 --> 31:50.600
Oh, what's your name?

31:52.201 --> 31:53.299
I'm Butter.

31:53.301 --> 31:54.137
Butter.

31:56.737 --> 31:59.841
How does a Mike
make butter better?

32:02.744 --> 32:05.648
Let me take a peek
under that hood?

32:10.619 --> 32:12.388
Please do.

32:16.858 --> 32:17.693
Yeah?

32:19.860 --> 32:20.696
Yeah.

32:24.398 --> 32:25.799
How are you today?

32:25.801 --> 32:26.799
Great.

32:26.801 --> 32:29.536
Still have that attitude?

32:29.538 --> 32:30.703
All right.

32:30.705 --> 32:32.340
I'll take Bosoms.

32:38.013 --> 32:40.312
You're so pretty.

32:40.314 --> 32:40.949
So pretty.

32:42.384 --> 32:43.719
Oh, what's this?

32:45.520 --> 32:46.853
Where did you come from?

32:46.855 --> 32:48.758
It's $20, only today.

32:49.725 --> 32:50.760
For her?

32:52.261 --> 32:55.861
I give you a discount
if you make her like it.

32:55.863 --> 32:57.265
There's a deal.

32:58.833 --> 33:01.800
You're coming with me, honey.

33:01.802 --> 33:02.838
I'll be gentle.

33:20.522 --> 33:22.524
Hey, this'll be the day.

33:25.926 --> 33:26.762
Huh.

33:27.728 --> 33:28.927
Won't you let me do this?

33:28.929 --> 33:32.398
No, don't fight
me, don't fight me.

33:32.400 --> 33:35.034
No, no, please, God, no!

33:35.036 --> 33:35.870
No, no!

33:37.339 --> 33:38.771
No!

33:38.773 --> 33:39.809
No!

33:42.644 --> 33:43.777
No, no!

33:43.779 --> 33:44.944
No!

33:44.946 --> 33:45.781
No!

33:48.483 --> 33:49.484
Oww!

33:51.852 --> 33:53.520
Somebody!

33:53.522 --> 33:54.921
No, no, no!

33:54.923 --> 33:55.757
No!

33:57.658 --> 34:01.360
You promised me you
were gonna behave.

34:01.362 --> 34:04.830
You don't behave,
you're worthless.

34:04.832 --> 34:05.667
No!

34:07.936 --> 34:08.971
No, no!

34:42.904 --> 34:45.003
Have
you heard anything?

34:45.005 --> 34:46.973
Just that one garbled message.

34:46.975 --> 34:49.007
How do we know if Sara's okay?

34:49.009 --> 34:49.978
Try her again.

34:51.913 --> 34:52.848
All right.

34:57.485 --> 34:58.918
Diane, is that you?

34:58.920 --> 35:01.121
Yes, hi, Mother Monica.

35:01.123 --> 35:02.889
Thank God you answered.

35:02.891 --> 35:05.925
I know, I'm sorry,
it has been so busy.

35:05.927 --> 35:07.059
Did you get Sara's message?

35:07.061 --> 35:08.862
It was pretty garbled.

35:08.864 --> 35:09.996
Oh dear.

35:09.998 --> 35:11.463
Huh.

35:11.465 --> 35:12.665
You know what?

35:12.667 --> 35:13.967
I bet she's on
the ship training.

35:13.969 --> 35:14.768
They don't exactly have great

35:14.770 --> 35:16.603
cellphone reception
out there, huh?

35:16.605 --> 35:19.038
And Natalie is
very, very worried.

35:19.040 --> 35:21.708
Yeah, I can only imagine.

35:21.710 --> 35:23.143
You know what?

35:23.145 --> 35:26.413
Why don't I see if I
can pull some strings?

35:26.415 --> 35:28.882
Maybe we can send her out
there so she can see Sara

35:28.884 --> 35:30.183
when she comes back to shore?

35:30.185 --> 35:33.520
Yes, we really do need
to hear from her, Diane.

35:33.522 --> 35:35.521
Okay, I'll see what I can do.

35:35.523 --> 35:37.924
I mean the whole thing
has just been so unfair.

35:37.926 --> 35:42.098
And, listen Mother Monica, I
am sure that Sara is just fine.

37:05.947 --> 37:08.083
Just let that trouble out.

37:41.650 --> 37:43.148
Congratulations, Amba.

37:43.150 --> 37:46.184
Look, I already told you,
I'm not interested, okay.

37:46.186 --> 37:47.119
Why not?

37:47.121 --> 37:49.121
For starters, I'm
kinda seeing somebody.

37:49.123 --> 37:52.157
So you're saying no to
me, but yes to someone else?

37:52.159 --> 37:53.661
I've gotta go.

37:55.563 --> 37:58.864
My little champion,
I am so proud.

37:58.866 --> 37:59.965
Thank you, ma.

37:59.967 --> 38:01.900
You're like
half-fish or something.

38:01.902 --> 38:04.804
And look at this bling,
we have to celebrate.

38:04.806 --> 38:07.072
Papa and I think
it's a lovely idea

38:07.074 --> 38:09.141
and you really deserve it today.

38:09.143 --> 38:11.009
Can I please
stay out until 11?

38:11.011 --> 38:11.844
No.

38:11.846 --> 38:12.911
But why not, papa?

38:12.913 --> 38:14.146
I'm 17.

38:14.148 --> 38:16.081
And how does that make
the streets any safer?

38:16.083 --> 38:19.052
What are you going to do
next year when she goes to MIT?

38:19.054 --> 38:20.887
Are you going to
put a GPS on her?

38:20.889 --> 38:24.157
I think we can let her
stay out one extra hour.

38:24.159 --> 38:27.128
She's no good to
anyone all locked up.

38:46.114 --> 38:47.913
Here.

38:47.915 --> 38:49.215
It's hot water and lemon.

38:49.217 --> 38:51.116
It will help you, okay.

38:51.118 --> 38:52.317
You wanna help me?

38:52.319 --> 38:54.020
Take the next guy
who tries to pick me.

38:54.022 --> 38:55.721
I don't want to be
here anymore than you do.

38:55.723 --> 38:58.059
Yeah, I highly doubt that.

38:59.994 --> 39:02.695
I was scavenging on the
streets in Sullivan city

39:02.697 --> 39:04.333
when I got this offer.

39:05.667 --> 39:07.670
I don't have any papers.

39:08.869 --> 39:12.241
If I don't earn money,
my family cannot eat.

39:13.808 --> 39:17.980
If I try anything and Simon
finds out, I'm finished.

39:21.715 --> 39:23.618
It's all for my family.

39:29.190 --> 39:31.793
Whoa, easy now, easy darling.

39:34.228 --> 39:35.728
- Sir.
- Jimmy.

39:35.730 --> 39:36.895
- How are you?
- I'm good.

39:36.897 --> 39:37.864
- They treat you good?
- Absolutely.

39:37.866 --> 39:38.998
All right.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.067
- Have a good day.
- You too.

39:41.069 --> 39:41.904
Whoa.

39:57.351 --> 39:58.721
Come on, boys.

40:01.121 --> 40:05.194
Beats the hell out of that
claptrap in Galveston.

40:08.730 --> 40:09.665
You okay?

40:16.071 --> 40:19.237
Enrique said you
had a modeling offer.

40:19.239 --> 40:21.273
A bullshit offer?

40:21.275 --> 40:22.978
I mean look at me.

40:24.179 --> 40:26.244
I should have known better.

40:26.246 --> 40:28.750
You look like a model to me.

40:29.884 --> 40:31.253
So what happened?

40:32.920 --> 40:36.658
I was waiting tables to
save money for college.

40:38.125 --> 40:42.395
One day, this customer tells
me he's looking for models

40:42.397 --> 40:46.768
so I went to his agency
and I spoke to other girls.

40:51.172 --> 40:53.308
He even saw their portfolios.

40:55.143 --> 40:58.213
And the money he
promised was unreal.

40:59.980 --> 41:01.382
So I did one shoot.

41:04.319 --> 41:07.322
And then I went
back for the second.

41:10.792 --> 41:12.058
Oh yeah.

41:12.060 --> 41:14.962
That's good, that's
a cover right there.

41:16.331 --> 41:19.766
You know, let's lose the dress.

41:19.768 --> 41:21.366
What do you mean?

41:21.368 --> 41:23.136
We're gonna
do lingerie today.

41:23.138 --> 41:26.471
It's tasteful, it's
classy, every girl does it.

41:26.473 --> 41:28.309
You'll look beautiful.

41:35.350 --> 41:39.819
I was in this freaky
room hooked up to a camera.

41:39.821 --> 41:41.322
Men came and went.

41:54.868 --> 41:58.873
After that, I was across
the border for a while.

42:01.342 --> 42:03.412
And then Simon bought me.

42:05.112 --> 42:08.114
Your parents
must be so worried.

42:08.116 --> 42:11.183
My mom's gone, but my dad...

42:11.185 --> 42:12.384
My dad, yeah.

42:12.386 --> 42:14.920
Yeah, he'd be searching
day and night.

42:14.922 --> 42:17.456
Maybe he'll find us?

42:17.458 --> 42:19.061
I don't think so.

42:20.594 --> 42:24.966
But I'm not worried because
Simon said 500 men and I can go.

42:28.302 --> 42:31.036
But do you really think
he's gonna let us go?

42:31.038 --> 42:32.304
As long as he knows that you

42:32.306 --> 42:35.308
understand the situation, yeah.

42:35.310 --> 42:36.145
Yeah.

42:37.377 --> 42:39.380
What situation?

42:40.415 --> 42:41.947
I told him.

42:41.949 --> 42:46.085
I said I know what you'll
do to me if I say anything.

42:46.087 --> 42:48.987
He said never mind him,
the cartels will skin

42:48.989 --> 42:51.993
my dad alive if we
make any trouble.

42:54.295 --> 42:56.429
I just wanna repay my debts

42:56.431 --> 42:59.498
and go to college like
I was supposed to.

42:59.500 --> 43:00.335
You know?

43:01.335 --> 43:05.373
It's the only way I can
put this shit behind me.

43:08.442 --> 43:09.474
Oh!

43:09.476 --> 43:10.511
Come on.

43:13.348 --> 43:15.114
Okay, again, line up.

43:15.116 --> 43:15.951
Let's go.

43:25.927 --> 43:27.196
Take your pick.

43:42.509 --> 43:43.578
Are you okay?

43:49.484 --> 43:51.386
Did you bump your head?

43:54.589 --> 43:56.424
I'll take care of you.

44:06.967 --> 44:09.404
Oh, you're a big, old girl.

44:11.105 --> 44:13.507
Talk a bit of Chinese for me.

44:29.489 --> 44:30.389
All right, that's it.

44:30.391 --> 44:31.226
Go.

44:34.996 --> 44:36.632
What do we got here?

44:50.177 --> 44:51.978
I want to see Simon.

44:51.980 --> 44:54.447
Simon don't take kindly
to unexpected visitors.

44:54.449 --> 44:58.487
You best be calling
before you come next time.

45:16.770 --> 45:18.306
What the hell?

45:25.545 --> 45:26.512
Simon!

45:26.514 --> 45:28.279
How'd you get in here?

45:28.281 --> 45:29.715
Simon!

45:29.717 --> 45:31.449
Simon ain't here.

45:31.451 --> 45:32.751
Jesus, Jesus.

45:32.753 --> 45:34.022
Shh, manners.

45:35.589 --> 45:37.489
Can we please see Simon?

45:37.491 --> 45:39.791
Simon ain't here.

45:39.793 --> 45:41.263
Get the girl.

45:51.706 --> 45:53.275
What's your name?

45:58.311 --> 46:00.415
And now we go find Simon.

46:04.552 --> 46:05.687
There is my man.

46:12.427 --> 46:13.729
Cesar and Jesus.

46:15.063 --> 46:16.362
Want to explain to
me why there's a girl

46:16.364 --> 46:19.498
with a bullet in her
forehead on my property?

46:19.500 --> 46:21.467
You no pay, Simon.

46:21.469 --> 46:25.704
You no pay and Senor
Morales gets very upset.

46:25.706 --> 46:26.871
Let me tell you something.

46:26.873 --> 46:29.541
A lot of things I care about
where Morales is concerned,

46:29.543 --> 46:31.143
but his feelings
ain't one of 'em.

46:31.145 --> 46:32.811
I'm sure it's reciprocated.

46:32.813 --> 46:35.181
He's a businessman as am I.

46:35.183 --> 46:38.516
You got some business you
wanna discuss with me?

46:38.518 --> 46:39.717
You owe money for girls.

46:39.719 --> 46:42.121
You owe money for drugs.

46:42.123 --> 46:43.588
You owe Mr Morales...

46:43.590 --> 46:45.858
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, Cesar!

46:45.860 --> 46:47.625
Get your fucking facts straight.

46:47.627 --> 46:49.228
Distributors are running
for the fucking trees

46:49.230 --> 46:51.400
because of shit like that.

46:53.601 --> 46:55.701
Nobody fucking wants their
loved one ending up neck

46:55.703 --> 46:59.137
in a fucking ditch with a
bullet in her Goddamned head

46:59.139 --> 47:03.375
because Morales sneezed and
nobody fucking said, bless you.

47:03.377 --> 47:06.378
Now, he told me that he
would back the fuck up

47:06.380 --> 47:08.550
and I expect him to do it.

47:09.549 --> 47:10.483
Back up.

47:10.485 --> 47:14.119
You think it's easy
to find girls for you?

47:14.121 --> 47:14.887
We do this for you.

47:14.889 --> 47:16.355
You pay your dime.

47:16.357 --> 47:17.723
Is it about girls?

47:17.725 --> 47:20.558
The two bitches you
dropped off last week?

47:20.560 --> 47:24.462
I did you a fucking
favor by taking them in.

47:24.464 --> 47:28.701
Now, maybe I'm not privy to
your Mexican way of accounting,

47:28.703 --> 47:30.469
but I'll tell you this shit.

47:30.471 --> 47:34.706
I paid in advance, mind
you, for a fucking chink.

47:34.708 --> 47:38.376
I roll that bitch over and
I find out you put a bullet

47:38.378 --> 47:42.551
in the forehead of my chink,
you and I gonna have a problem.

47:45.853 --> 47:48.790
No problem, no
problemo, Jesus.

47:56.364 --> 47:58.366
Okay, you can have them.

47:59.799 --> 48:00.634
Vamos.

48:30.531 --> 48:31.799
Almost there.

49:00.761 --> 49:02.596
Let's have one more.

50:32.953 --> 50:34.922
This banana is sad meat.

50:36.589 --> 50:39.358
When I was little,
we got proper banana.

50:39.360 --> 50:40.762
Sweet like sugar.

50:42.797 --> 50:44.266
Go on, eat now.

50:46.634 --> 50:47.636
No hungry.

50:51.739 --> 50:53.706
Everybody's hungry.

50:53.708 --> 50:55.607
That's why we're here.

50:55.609 --> 50:56.842
I thought you were
here because you chose

50:56.844 --> 50:58.643
to do all of this.

50:58.645 --> 51:00.948
Maybe but it's still hunger.

51:04.752 --> 51:08.353
Hungry for a better
life is why my husband

51:08.355 --> 51:11.825
got that dodgy job in
construction in Lagos.

51:13.427 --> 51:17.029
Hungry for profit is why
they didn't have good safety

51:17.031 --> 51:18.866
and he busted his leg.

51:20.500 --> 51:23.904
That left us hungry for food
so I had to leave my home.

51:25.005 --> 51:28.507
But wasn't one
other job in Nigeria?

51:28.509 --> 51:30.875
We don't all come
from nice families

51:30.877 --> 51:33.914
with money and
cars and education.

51:36.116 --> 51:37.051
Am I right?

51:42.822 --> 51:47.159
Many girls from my village went
abroad and made good money.

51:47.161 --> 51:50.532
I thought I'd be
back a long time ago.

51:51.866 --> 51:53.868
Didn't work out that way.

51:57.138 --> 52:01.572
Before the madams were
paid to bring us to Europe,

52:01.574 --> 52:04.777
we must first go
to the Juju priest.

52:06.179 --> 52:09.951
He takes our soul and
sells it to the madams.

52:14.020 --> 52:18.392
If we do not repay our debts,
the madams can curse us

52:19.659 --> 52:23.130
or our children wherever
we touch the earth.

52:25.031 --> 52:28.569
I still owe those
madams a lot of money.

52:32.940 --> 52:35.877
That's why I keep
Nelson near me.

52:37.944 --> 52:41.913
They can't get to him
until I am back home.

52:41.915 --> 52:45.817
So you will go back
home if you could?

52:45.819 --> 52:47.087
Wouldn't you?

52:48.121 --> 52:49.855
I don't know.

52:49.857 --> 52:51.056
Don't do that.

52:51.058 --> 52:51.924
Don't do what?

52:51.926 --> 52:54.692
Don't think about
who you used to be.

52:54.694 --> 52:57.228
You have to keep that
other girl buried far away

52:57.230 --> 53:00.866
cuz in here she'll
drive you mad.

53:00.868 --> 53:04.036
But that's the
girl my parents love.

53:04.038 --> 53:05.039
Not me.

53:06.005 --> 53:08.239
And she's the one
who got you here.

53:08.241 --> 53:11.513
No, she's at MIT
getting her degree

53:13.813 --> 53:16.849
and meeting awesome people
and she's on the swim team

53:16.851 --> 53:18.817
and she's kicking ass.

53:18.819 --> 53:20.518
And leave her out of it, okay?

53:20.520 --> 53:23.521
Amba, that girl got you here

53:23.523 --> 53:26.594
and, now, this girl
here is pregnant.

53:31.699 --> 53:33.998
You might as well tell
Simon cuz when he finds out

53:34.000 --> 53:35.099
he's gonna get rid of it.

53:35.101 --> 53:37.806
No, she can't get rid of it.

53:40.007 --> 53:42.641
It's against God's will.

53:42.643 --> 53:44.208
God, okay?

53:44.210 --> 53:45.045
Which God?

53:46.279 --> 53:48.846
The God that sent you here?

53:48.848 --> 53:53.150
Or maybe the one who got
her pregnant by some wanker?

53:53.152 --> 53:56.121
You two girls are
crazy, you know that?

53:56.123 --> 53:57.889
You think there's some
other world out there

53:57.891 --> 53:59.625
that you belong to.

53:59.627 --> 54:00.462
Forget it.

54:05.065 --> 54:08.766
I see that crucifix you
wear around your neck,

54:08.768 --> 54:10.201
but I don't see
you praying anymore

54:10.203 --> 54:13.040
for some God to
come and save you.

54:14.074 --> 54:15.176
You know why?

54:16.210 --> 54:19.177
Cuz you know he
doesn't care about you,

54:19.179 --> 54:20.915
me or nobody like us.

54:53.179 --> 54:54.980
Jesus Christ, I can't stand

54:54.982 --> 54:57.652
being in this fucking shit hole.

54:59.052 --> 55:00.918
We got a problem.

55:00.920 --> 55:01.989
No, no, no.

55:03.190 --> 55:05.023
No, you've got a problem.

55:05.025 --> 55:07.224
Maybe you don't understand,
they shot two of my men.

55:07.226 --> 55:09.061
They dumped a pile of
fucking butchered girls

55:09.063 --> 55:11.195
on my Goddamn property.

55:11.197 --> 55:13.665
Well, Morales has got balls.

55:13.667 --> 55:15.800
We'll have to give him that.

55:15.802 --> 55:17.302
Just pay him on time, Simon.

55:17.304 --> 55:19.036
Morales and I
have an agreement.

55:19.038 --> 55:21.773
It's just not an issue.

55:21.775 --> 55:23.608
You've never really understood

55:23.610 --> 55:25.177
what we're doing here, did you?

55:25.179 --> 55:26.911
Making money is what
the fuck we're doing.

55:26.913 --> 55:28.813
No, no, no.

55:28.815 --> 55:31.718
We are in a system
of making money.

55:32.920 --> 55:35.654
Those cartel boys
can procure girls

55:35.656 --> 55:38.255
and drugs in a way
we cannot here.

55:38.257 --> 55:40.192
And then they send us
those girls and drugs

55:40.194 --> 55:42.094
which they have in abundance.

55:42.096 --> 55:46.998
And we send them money and guns
which we have in abundance.

55:47.000 --> 55:48.166
Look, I'm just saying if
this shit goes unchecked

55:48.168 --> 55:50.134
they're gonna run the fuck
all over us and you know it.

55:50.136 --> 55:52.906
You don't piss
unless I tell ya.

55:54.241 --> 55:58.210
Simon, it's my rangers
that keep you open.

55:58.212 --> 56:01.212
It's my agents that
keep the border open

56:01.214 --> 56:04.815
so, if and when I feel
someone needs a lesson,

56:04.817 --> 56:06.186
then I will decide.

56:07.821 --> 56:11.422
In the meantime, you follow
orders and work in my system.

56:11.424 --> 56:12.359
Understand?

56:15.194 --> 56:16.597
Yes, sir, I do.

56:18.799 --> 56:22.070
Now, what did you
do with the bodies?

56:23.170 --> 56:26.641
The bottom of the
river by the house.

56:28.007 --> 56:30.310
Simon, this is our heritage.

56:36.750 --> 56:38.753
We are traders in flesh.

56:41.121 --> 56:42.853
Those boys south of
the border allow us

56:42.855 --> 56:47.025
to do our trade the
way our ancestors did.

56:47.027 --> 56:48.460
No cost of labor.

56:48.462 --> 56:50.228
So being a part
of this tradition

56:50.230 --> 56:52.233
should make you feel proud.

56:53.801 --> 56:55.333
Okay, sorry.

56:55.335 --> 56:56.768
I'm sorry.

56:56.770 --> 56:58.302
You're right.

56:58.304 --> 57:02.306
Morales did go too far and I
shall communicate that to him.

57:02.308 --> 57:04.177
You will do nothing.

57:06.013 --> 57:06.848
Clear?

57:08.449 --> 57:09.280
Good.

57:09.282 --> 57:10.949
Now, get, go on.

57:10.951 --> 57:11.786
Simon.

57:14.755 --> 57:18.326
Don't you ever be late
with my money again.

57:26.366 --> 57:30.271
All right, you guys were
lucky that was a sale.

57:36.275 --> 57:37.476
Much obliged.

57:37.478 --> 57:41.145
Don't forget to give
Yolanda and Enrique.

57:41.147 --> 57:41.982
Who else?

57:49.089 --> 57:51.322
How come you're
not taking anything?

57:51.324 --> 57:53.125
Cuz tonight I'm free.

57:53.127 --> 57:54.259
You're finished?

57:54.261 --> 57:55.396
Six more.

57:57.797 --> 57:59.797
Can you call someone for me?

57:59.799 --> 58:02.436
Sure, if you
give me the number.

58:05.471 --> 58:09.306
I asked about the tea
but they didn't bring any.

58:09.308 --> 58:10.143
I'm sorry.

58:15.281 --> 58:17.350
Jenna can call my sister.

58:27.427 --> 58:29.430
Let's go, Jenna.

58:30.831 --> 58:32.364
Why is he here?

58:39.139 --> 58:41.239
Why the hell is he here?

58:41.241 --> 58:42.909
He's here for you.

58:44.277 --> 58:45.210
I finished.

58:45.212 --> 58:46.511
I did my 500, I finished.

58:46.513 --> 58:48.346
A little insurance
policy for you, all right.

58:48.348 --> 58:49.280
Just calm down.

58:49.282 --> 58:50.549
That's 500, you said 500.

58:50.551 --> 58:52.250
I have six more
and then I'm done.

58:52.252 --> 58:54.085
I don't know what kinda
faulty Math you're using

58:54.087 --> 58:55.353
but, according to my
spreadsheet, you're still

58:55.355 --> 58:56.587
a hundred and twenty shy
of being square with me.

58:56.589 --> 58:57.422
All right?

58:57.424 --> 58:58.456
So let's just relax.

58:58.458 --> 59:01.125
I finished my 500.

59:01.127 --> 59:01.960
Stop it!

59:01.962 --> 59:02.994
No, I have six more.

59:02.996 --> 59:03.829
You didn't do five...

59:03.831 --> 59:04.462
Calm down!

59:04.464 --> 59:05.297
I'm done!

59:05.299 --> 59:06.331
Hey, hey, hey!

59:06.333 --> 59:07.299
I'm done!

59:07.301 --> 59:08.136
I'm done!

59:09.869 --> 59:11.001
I'm finished!

59:11.003 --> 59:12.137
I'm finished!

59:12.139 --> 59:12.971
Uh!

59:12.973 --> 59:13.808
Ahh!

59:16.009 --> 59:16.842
Let me go!

59:16.844 --> 59:17.942
Let me go!

59:17.944 --> 59:19.344
Get your hands off me!

59:19.346 --> 59:20.378
Get off!

59:20.380 --> 59:21.512
Let me go!

59:21.514 --> 59:23.114
Let me go!

59:23.116 --> 59:24.215
Let go!

59:24.217 --> 59:25.183
Let go!

59:25.185 --> 59:26.183
Let go!

59:26.185 --> 59:27.020
Let go!

59:42.034 --> 59:42.869
No!

59:43.871 --> 59:45.003
No!

59:45.005 --> 59:46.270
No, you!

59:46.272 --> 59:48.072
You, you promised!

59:48.074 --> 59:49.143
You promised!

59:50.444 --> 59:51.279
No!

01:00:00.654 --> 01:00:03.654
Fill a body bag with ice.

01:00:03.656 --> 01:00:08.028
And girls clean that shit
up off my Goddamned floor!

01:00:33.319 --> 01:00:34.319
You have it on ice?

01:00:34.321 --> 01:00:35.156
Yeah.

01:00:38.292 --> 01:00:42.126
You tell Simon that if
any organs besides the lungs

01:00:42.128 --> 01:00:45.596
are damaged, I'm gonna deduct
the corresponding amount

01:00:45.598 --> 01:00:46.665
from the next specimen.

01:00:46.667 --> 01:00:48.400
Organs are fine, Doc.

01:00:48.402 --> 01:00:49.467
Well, they need to be.

01:00:49.469 --> 01:00:51.873
People on both sides waiting.

01:01:05.351 --> 01:01:07.418
Can't you call the
police or something?

01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:09.186
The same police
who came last week?

01:01:09.188 --> 01:01:10.020
Shut up!

01:01:10.022 --> 01:01:10.654
Sara.

01:01:10.656 --> 01:01:11.489
No!

01:01:11.491 --> 01:01:12.690
You lied to me!

01:01:12.692 --> 01:01:15.528
You said 500 men
that's a good deal.

01:01:16.496 --> 01:01:19.233
Please, I have to
call my sister.

01:01:21.335 --> 01:01:23.503
I wish I could help you.

01:01:25.471 --> 01:01:26.603
I have to get out of here.

01:01:26.605 --> 01:01:29.040
No, there is no way out.

01:01:29.042 --> 01:01:30.308
And you don't want
to know what Simon

01:01:30.310 --> 01:01:32.980
did to the last girls who tried.

01:01:35.581 --> 01:01:37.518
Just go to sleep, okay?

01:01:39.219 --> 01:01:41.386
Tomorrow a new day.

01:01:41.388 --> 01:01:44.292
It's nothing new
about it, Gypsy.

01:01:46.192 --> 01:01:46.826
Please.

01:01:48.161 --> 01:01:51.496
Please, I need you to help me.

01:01:51.498 --> 01:01:52.532
Look, forget it.

01:01:55.002 --> 01:01:57.735
Even if you get out of your
room, Max is up all night

01:01:57.737 --> 01:02:00.739
thanks to his energy drink
and there are always guys

01:02:00.741 --> 01:02:03.511
running the ranch,
keeping watch.

01:03:36.435 --> 01:03:38.268
It's what I thought.

01:03:38.270 --> 01:03:39.205
Piss on it.

01:03:40.507 --> 01:03:41.342
Right now.

01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:54.054
I can't go if
you're standing there.

01:03:57.757 --> 01:03:59.693
You got 30 seconds.

01:04:19.545 --> 01:04:20.380
Take it.

01:04:21.748 --> 01:04:23.348
We do this the easy
way or the hard way

01:04:23.350 --> 01:04:25.819
but it's going down your throat.

01:04:31.290 --> 01:04:32.125
Tongue.

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:49.376
What happened to you?

01:04:50.310 --> 01:04:51.811
Simon found out.

01:04:56.415 --> 01:04:58.184
What happened to you?

01:04:59.418 --> 01:05:00.587
Drunk Texan.

01:05:18.871 --> 01:05:21.773
Sara, Sara, wake up, wake up!

01:05:21.775 --> 01:05:23.711
Come quick, come quick!

01:05:30.750 --> 01:05:31.752
Oh my God!

01:05:37.456 --> 01:05:39.926
That's not supposed to happen.

01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:42.730
Come on, come on!

01:05:46.465 --> 01:05:48.465
She needs a doctor.

01:05:48.467 --> 01:05:49.766
I'll do whatever you want.

01:05:49.768 --> 01:05:50.701
A hundred men!

01:05:50.703 --> 01:05:53.237
Just call that doctor now.

01:05:53.239 --> 01:05:54.340
Goddamn it!

01:06:12.391 --> 01:06:14.759
Hey, hey, hey, I'm Dr Durand.

01:06:14.761 --> 01:06:16.293
Okay, you lost
quite a bit of blood

01:06:16.295 --> 01:06:18.563
but your discharge
appears to be complete.

01:06:18.565 --> 01:06:20.364
I gave you a stimulant
and some fluids.

01:06:20.366 --> 01:06:21.799
All right?

01:06:21.801 --> 01:06:24.904
She's gonna need to
rest for a while.

01:06:26.706 --> 01:06:27.538
Doctor?

01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:28.773
Yeah?

01:06:28.775 --> 01:06:32.309
Um, you have those
pills right for pain?

01:06:32.311 --> 01:06:33.911
If it's indicated.

01:06:33.913 --> 01:06:36.380
And they help
you sleep better?

01:06:36.382 --> 01:06:37.315
A narco?

01:06:37.317 --> 01:06:39.820
That can knock out an elephant.

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:44.021
Do you think my
friend could have some?

01:06:44.023 --> 01:06:45.422
She'll be fine.

01:06:45.424 --> 01:06:46.924
What if she gets sick again?

01:06:46.926 --> 01:06:51.029
Call me
and I'll assess her.

01:06:51.031 --> 01:06:55.866
Please, doctor, my friend
has been through so much

01:06:55.868 --> 01:06:58.738
can you please leave some narco?

01:07:01.540 --> 01:07:02.375
Umm.

01:07:06.513 --> 01:07:08.813
Here are two pills.

01:07:08.815 --> 01:07:10.717
But only one at a time.

01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:14.421
Thank you.

01:07:17.723 --> 01:07:18.891
Feel better.

01:07:24.897 --> 01:07:26.096
What day is today?

01:07:26.098 --> 01:07:27.732
Saturday.

01:07:27.734 --> 01:07:28.902
No, Wednesday.

01:07:30.069 --> 01:07:31.436
Hell, I don't know.

01:07:31.438 --> 01:07:32.273
Why?

01:07:35.607 --> 01:07:37.909
Right, so this is
how it's gonna go down.

01:07:37.911 --> 01:07:40.777
We're gonna cross near Progreso
in the next couple of days.

01:07:40.779 --> 01:07:43.480
I want each and everyone
of you with me except Max.

01:07:43.482 --> 01:07:45.849
He's gonna stay here, he's
gonna man the brothel.

01:07:45.851 --> 01:07:48.985
I don't give a shit how many
people stand in front of us.

01:07:48.987 --> 01:07:51.088
I want to see Cesar with a
fucking bullet in his head.

01:07:51.090 --> 01:07:52.824
Simon, with
all due respect,

01:07:52.826 --> 01:07:54.858
no one's ever gone across
and done something like that.

01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:56.527
There's no way
we'll make it back.

01:07:56.529 --> 01:07:58.895
Listen to me, Morales, ain't
the only dog in town here.

01:07:58.897 --> 01:08:00.732
This guy's got
plenty of enemies.

01:08:00.734 --> 01:08:02.467
Some of those enemies
are my friends.

01:08:02.469 --> 01:08:04.969
Boss, Christian
okay with this?

01:08:04.971 --> 01:08:06.572
Fuck Christian.

01:08:08.007 --> 01:08:10.875
Spineless, little bitch like
every other politician I know.

01:08:10.877 --> 01:08:14.746
Nobody comes onto my
property and does his shit.

01:08:14.748 --> 01:08:18.919
Christ, I don't even let a dog
on this land to take a shit.

01:08:21.886 --> 01:08:23.621
Calm down now!

01:08:23.622 --> 01:08:24.524
What is it?

01:08:25.491 --> 01:08:27.992
Come on, come here.

01:08:27.993 --> 01:08:29.594
How are you feeling?

01:08:29.595 --> 01:08:30.894
A little better, I guess.

01:08:30.895 --> 01:08:33.930
Good, because we're going.

01:08:33.932 --> 01:08:34.930
Going where?

01:08:34.933 --> 01:08:35.968
Home.

01:08:38.036 --> 01:08:39.804
What do you mean home?

01:08:39.805 --> 01:08:42.540
Tomorrow night, I have a plan.

01:08:42.542 --> 01:08:44.573
I told you guys
I can't go back.

01:08:44.576 --> 01:08:45.676
Yes, you can.

01:08:45.678 --> 01:08:46.943
And my plan will work.

01:08:46.944 --> 01:08:48.880
Maybe to the front
door and then what?

01:08:48.881 --> 01:08:50.814
Enrique said that Simon
is taking all of his men

01:08:50.816 --> 01:08:52.082
across the border
tomorrow night.

01:08:52.084 --> 01:08:55.421
It'll just be Max
and then we're free.

01:08:56.889 --> 01:08:57.823
I don't know, Sara.

01:08:57.825 --> 01:08:59.524
And tomorrow happens
to be the next time

01:08:59.526 --> 01:09:01.426
the train passes through.

01:09:01.428 --> 01:09:03.193
Don't you see,
God is helping us?

01:09:03.194 --> 01:09:07.165
Mali said we just have
to lie back and survive.

01:09:07.167 --> 01:09:08.099
That's true.

01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:09.667
I did say that.

01:09:09.669 --> 01:09:10.904
We can do this.

01:09:14.941 --> 01:09:17.573
I've been thinking
a lot recently.

01:09:17.576 --> 01:09:19.578
You almost died in here.

01:09:20.979 --> 01:09:23.979
And my body has been turned out
more times than I can count.

01:09:23.982 --> 01:09:25.582
How much worse can it get?

01:09:25.584 --> 01:09:28.121
A lot worse,
Mali, you said so.

01:09:29.188 --> 01:09:32.058
Yes, but I want to see my son.

01:09:33.926 --> 01:09:37.096
And I have to get
back to my sister.

01:09:39.465 --> 01:09:41.167
Leave me out of this.

01:09:44.970 --> 01:09:47.407
I told you no closed doors.

01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:50.174
You're back in the
line-up tomorrow.

01:09:50.176 --> 01:09:51.943
But the doctor
said that I can't...

01:09:51.944 --> 01:09:53.542
Tomorrow.

01:09:53.545 --> 01:09:55.048
You understand me?

01:10:19.004 --> 01:10:21.107
Ladies, it's closing.

01:10:22.141 --> 01:10:23.043
Time is up.

01:12:01.206 --> 01:12:02.276
Amba, listen.

01:12:05.078 --> 01:12:07.110
I know how you're feeling.

01:12:07.112 --> 01:12:08.080
I feel it too.

01:12:11.249 --> 01:12:15.621
Don't think about going back,
just think about getting out.

01:12:16.789 --> 01:12:18.325
We can do this, okay?

01:13:44.243 --> 01:13:46.743
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

01:13:46.745 --> 01:13:48.914
Come on, come on, come on.

01:13:51.249 --> 01:13:52.051
Okay.

01:13:56.989 --> 01:13:57.824
Uhh!

01:14:20.413 --> 01:14:21.248
Thanks.

01:14:24.049 --> 01:14:25.116
Are you ready?

01:14:25.118 --> 01:14:25.951
Yes.

01:14:28.254 --> 01:14:29.723
She won't come.

01:14:30.923 --> 01:14:32.092
We have to go.

01:14:45.137 --> 01:14:47.438
My mom once said
to me I am no good

01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:49.442
to anyone all locked up.

01:14:50.375 --> 01:14:52.378
Let's get out of here.

01:15:26.379 --> 01:15:27.748
What's that?

01:15:40.058 --> 01:15:42.126
Gypsy is all right.

01:16:59.472 --> 01:17:00.373
Bugger off!

01:17:31.003 --> 01:17:32.438
No, no, that way!

01:17:34.507 --> 01:17:38.141
Come on,
come on, come on!

01:17:38.143 --> 01:17:39.612
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

01:17:42.949 --> 01:17:44.581
I'm not a good swimmer.

01:17:44.583 --> 01:17:46.449
It's okay, it's okay.

01:17:46.451 --> 01:17:49.054
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

01:18:03.069 --> 01:18:04.236
Help!

01:18:32.164 --> 01:18:33.529
Come on, come on!

01:18:33.531 --> 01:18:34.467
Go, go, go!

01:19:30.623 --> 01:19:32.025
No, no, no, no!

01:19:35.460 --> 01:19:37.693
Okay, we have to keep going.

01:19:37.695 --> 01:19:40.530
Look there's a
truck right there.

01:19:40.532 --> 01:19:41.765
Simon's truck stop.

01:19:41.767 --> 01:19:43.567
It's our only chance.

01:19:43.569 --> 01:19:44.603
Ladder!

01:19:45.838 --> 01:19:46.673
Ahh!

01:19:55.580 --> 01:19:56.613
Try and get her up.

01:19:56.615 --> 01:19:57.448
Try and get her up.

01:19:57.450 --> 01:19:58.582
Try and get her up.

01:19:58.584 --> 01:20:00.153
Try, try, try, try!

01:20:01.620 --> 01:20:03.390
Let's go.

01:20:05.590 --> 01:20:06.622
Gameboy is here.

01:20:06.624 --> 01:20:07.457
Shh.

01:20:07.459 --> 01:20:08.727
Gameboy's here.

01:20:12.097 --> 01:20:13.262
We don't have time.

01:20:13.264 --> 01:20:14.230
You two go.

01:20:14.232 --> 01:20:15.565
We can't leave you.

01:20:15.567 --> 01:20:16.600
Come on, Mali.

01:20:16.602 --> 01:20:17.437
Come on.

01:20:18.803 --> 01:20:19.638
Come on.

01:20:29.481 --> 01:20:31.582
I promise we'll
find each other again.

01:20:31.584 --> 01:20:32.416
Okay?

01:20:32.418 --> 01:20:33.652
I beg you, run!

01:21:01.847 --> 01:21:02.749
Call Max.

01:21:03.615 --> 01:21:06.750
Get him to check the rooms.

01:21:17.862 --> 01:21:20.232
Damn madams got me, son.

01:21:38.918 --> 01:21:40.384
This is open!

01:21:40.386 --> 01:21:41.221
Come on!

01:22:14.887 --> 01:22:16.755
See what he wants.

01:22:17.655 --> 01:22:19.223
Hell, yeah, we got 'em good.

01:22:19.225 --> 01:22:20.524
Yeah, we
got ourselves an issue.

01:22:20.526 --> 01:22:21.725
Two girls got out.

01:22:21.727 --> 01:22:23.793
Put Simon on the phone.

01:22:23.795 --> 01:22:24.694
Got out, what?

01:22:24.696 --> 01:22:26.796
Sara and
Amba, they're gone.

01:22:26.798 --> 01:22:28.832
We got Mali here.

01:22:28.834 --> 01:22:33.470
How the fuck did you two
shit heads make that happen?

01:22:33.472 --> 01:22:35.208
Check the truck stop.

01:22:45.851 --> 01:22:47.650
Security footage.

01:22:47.652 --> 01:22:48.752
Run it back!

01:22:48.754 --> 01:22:49.786
All right.

01:22:49.788 --> 01:22:50.621
Now!

01:22:50.623 --> 01:22:51.456
Shit.

01:22:55.628 --> 01:22:56.460
There, there, there!

01:22:56.462 --> 01:22:57.362
Stop, stop!

01:22:58.329 --> 01:23:00.596
How long ago was that?

01:23:00.598 --> 01:23:02.968
Ah, about half an hour.

01:23:05.637 --> 01:23:06.939
Yeah, I got 'em.

01:23:08.039 --> 01:23:09.840
Star Freight.

01:23:09.842 --> 01:23:12.245
Depot's 20 minutes from here.

01:23:13.611 --> 01:23:14.778
Oh, what the hell!

01:23:14.780 --> 01:23:15.878
Hey!

01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:16.715
Hey!

01:23:33.598 --> 01:23:35.532
Hi, folks,

01:23:35.534 --> 01:23:37.801
Los Angeles, okay.

01:23:37.803 --> 01:23:38.938
Okay, thank you.

01:23:41.005 --> 01:23:42.609
Have a good trip.

01:23:44.476 --> 01:23:46.909
Two tickets for Austin please.

01:23:46.911 --> 01:23:49.845
You
girls all right?

01:23:49.847 --> 01:23:51.783
The tickets please.

01:24:07.333 --> 01:24:08.598
That's for all of us.

01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:09.399
Why I
like your pigtails.

01:24:09.401 --> 01:24:10.667
Thank you.

01:24:10.669 --> 01:24:11.335
Very

01:24:11.337 --> 01:24:12.935
Okay, thank you.

01:24:12.937 --> 01:24:14.440
Thank you so much.

01:24:23.949 --> 01:24:25.649
It's one or the other.

01:24:25.651 --> 01:24:29.355
Check the train station cuz
they're either here or there.

01:25:15.032 --> 01:25:15.868
Hold up.

01:25:19.704 --> 01:25:22.639
A couple girls ran
away from home.

01:25:22.641 --> 01:25:23.974
Clothes might even still be wet.

01:25:23.976 --> 01:25:25.509
See anything like that?

01:25:25.511 --> 01:25:27.109
No, I ain't seen
nothing like that.

01:25:27.111 --> 01:25:29.945
Let me take a look.

01:25:43.027 --> 01:25:44.627
Hey,
come on man, I gotta go.

01:25:44.629 --> 01:25:45.931
I'm on a schedule.

01:26:30.008 --> 01:26:32.842
Father Davis, very
sorry to disturb you, Sir.

01:26:32.844 --> 01:26:34.978
There are two young
girls here to see you.

01:26:34.980 --> 01:26:37.917
They say they know
a Mother Monica.

01:26:57.035 --> 01:26:58.070
Hello.

01:26:59.036 --> 01:26:59.871
Hello.

01:27:01.772 --> 01:27:02.607
Sara!

01:27:03.775 --> 01:27:05.108
Oh my God!

01:27:05.110 --> 01:27:06.545
Oh my dear God!

01:27:14.085 --> 01:27:16.886
Christian Conrad, you're
being charged with violations

01:27:16.888 --> 01:27:19.890
of the United States Trafficking
Victims Protection Act.

01:27:19.892 --> 01:27:22.158
You're further being charged
with drug trafficking,

01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:25.895
pimping, statutory rape and a
shit load of other offenses.

01:27:25.897 --> 01:27:28.899
You are making
a large mistake.

01:27:36.975 --> 01:27:40.243
FBI,
get out of the car!

01:28:25.057 --> 01:28:28.828
I get to actually fly
on a plane this time.

01:28:37.102 --> 01:28:38.801
No, Sara, I can't take that.

01:28:38.803 --> 01:28:40.539
It's for good juju.

01:28:49.181 --> 01:28:51.651
Looks really pretty on you.

01:29:21.079 --> 01:29:23.179
Hello,
you have reached the Shahs.

01:29:23.181 --> 01:29:25.114
Please leave a message.

01:29:26.785 --> 01:29:27.417
Mama.

01:29:27.419 --> 01:29:29.284
Papa.

01:29:29.286 --> 01:29:30.121
It's me.

01:29:32.124 --> 01:29:32.959
I'm okay.

01:29:35.660 --> 01:29:36.292
Amba.

01:29:36.294 --> 01:29:37.827
Mama!

01:29:37.829 --> 01:29:38.961
Oh my God.

01:29:38.963 --> 01:29:39.796
Mummy!

01:29:39.798 --> 01:29:41.267
Oh my God!

01:29:45.870 --> 01:29:47.339
My baby, oh my baby!

01:29:48.773 --> 01:29:50.008
Thank you Lord!

01:30:04.255 --> 01:30:05.290
Sara!

01:30:15.167 --> 01:30:16.966
Oh God!

01:30:16.968 --> 01:30:17.803
Oh, oh!

01:30:19.471 --> 01:30:20.306
Oh!

01:30:23.107 --> 01:30:24.407
Told you I'd be back.

01:30:24.409 --> 01:30:26.042
I told you.

01:30:26.044 --> 01:30:28.147
I told you I'd come back.

01:31:12.490 --> 01:31:14.926
I'll take the little one.
