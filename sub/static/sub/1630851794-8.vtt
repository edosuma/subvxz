[man 1]
<i>  yeah, it'll be good to have</i>
<i>  kris back again, you know,</i>

00:10.311 --> 00:13.712
he's got
a lot of responsibility
now besides being the captain.

00:13.714 --> 00:15.214
He's got a little baby now.

00:16.417 --> 00:17.649
[man 2] there he comes.

00:17.651 --> 00:19.018
[kris] I'm back.

00:19.020 --> 00:22.388
Meet the newest
member of the family.

00:22.390 --> 00:25.491
<i>  Okay, so here's the deal,</i>
<i>  I just have my new baby,</i>

00:25.493 --> 00:30.062
<i>  I owe a bunch of money</i>
<i>  on my mining equipment</i>
<i>  and I'm not sleepy.</i>

00:30.064 --> 00:31.263
<i>  And while I was gone,</i>

00:31.265 --> 00:34.033
<i>  I had to trust my dad</i>
<i>  and brother to get gold.</i>

00:34.035 --> 00:35.100
It's cold out here.

00:35.102 --> 00:36.268
Come on, baby, let's go.

00:36.270 --> 00:37.970
-[man 2]
this baby's cute as hell.
-Be careful.

00:37.972 --> 00:40.005
I know, let me watch
my baby there.

00:40.007 --> 00:41.073
<i> [kris] I'm freaking out.</i>

00:41.075 --> 00:43.442
<i>  I need this to work</i>
<i>  more than ever.</i>

00:43.444 --> 00:46.011
<i>  I just need to stay positive,</i>
<i>  focus on the future.</i>

00:46.013 --> 00:48.414
<i>  And, man, I hope my dad</i>
<i>  and brother came through.</i>

00:49.417 --> 00:51.083
<i> You better got gold yesterday.</i>

00:51.085 --> 00:53.152
[baby crying]

01:09.170 --> 01:11.003
<i> [andy] everything's actually</i>
<i>  going good today.</i>

01:12.406 --> 01:14.773
<i>  Kris ain't here,</i>
<i>  so I got to keep</i>
<i>  this [bleep] going,</i>

01:14.775 --> 01:16.208
<i>  and I told them I would, too,</i>

01:16.210 --> 01:17.509
so I'm a man of my word.

01:17.511 --> 01:18.811
When I say I'm going to do
something,

01:18.813 --> 01:20.446
I'm going to
[bleep] try my hardest.

01:21.515 --> 01:23.215
[narrator]
<i>  with bills to pay...</i>

01:23.217 --> 01:24.483
<i> [andy] it's game time.</i>

01:24.485 --> 01:27.686
[narrator]
<i>  ...There's a different kelly</i>
<i>  at the helm.</i>

01:27.688 --> 01:29.555
So my brother's
in anchorage right now

01:29.557 --> 01:31.924
dealing with his new daughter.

01:31.926 --> 01:34.593
And here we are,
we're making the operation run

01:34.595 --> 01:37.596
while he's away
and start the engines,
suit up,

01:37.598 --> 01:40.032
<i>  jump in the water</i>
<i>  and start making our money.</i>

01:40.034 --> 01:42.868
So my brother's down
in anchorage dealing
with his new baby.

01:42.870 --> 01:45.537
He's worried
about how the operation
is going to run without him.

01:45.539 --> 01:47.372
<i>  But think</i>
<i>  about it, without my brother,</i>

01:47.374 --> 01:48.474
<i>  there's not going to be</i>
<i>  yelling</i>

01:48.476 --> 01:50.309
and people
are going to actually
start working

01:50.311 --> 01:52.544
and they're going to do
what the hell I tell them
to do.

01:52.546 --> 01:54.146
I got this while he's gone.

01:55.416 --> 01:57.549
It's a lot quieter
without kris here.

01:57.551 --> 01:59.218
He gets too excited too easy.

01:59.220 --> 02:00.419
You know what I mean?

02:00.421 --> 02:01.820
If he'd calm down,

02:01.822 --> 02:04.089
<i>  take a step back</i>
<i>  and take a look</i>
<i>  at the operation,</i>

02:04.091 --> 02:05.924
<i>  it's running all right.</i>

02:05.926 --> 02:08.193
We're in debt
this season and it sucks.

02:08.195 --> 02:11.263
We need to get
another six ounces
just to break even.

02:11.265 --> 02:13.465
<i>  The plan today is for me</i>
<i>  to go down first</i>

02:13.467 --> 02:16.235
<i>  and hit the box hard</i>
<i>  and then have another diver</i>
<i>  go behind me.</i>

02:16.237 --> 02:18.971
James is sick, so my brother
has a new guy coming out,

02:18.973 --> 02:20.205
so we'll check him out.

02:20.207 --> 02:22.574
High pressures are on.

02:22.576 --> 02:25.444
Once these things
start [bleep],
I can go sit up.

02:25.446 --> 02:28.947
<i>  We never sit up</i>
<i>  until it's [bleep] running.</i>

02:28.949 --> 02:31.550
My brother's full
of negativity
and it brings the morale down

02:31.552 --> 02:33.519
and makes it hard to be
focused on the gold.

02:33.521 --> 02:35.721
We just got to stay positive
and on our game

02:35.723 --> 02:37.389
and we'll make more gold.

02:39.126 --> 02:41.426
[man speaking]

02:43.130 --> 02:44.730
where's it?
I packed it all.

02:48.402 --> 02:50.102
I don't know
how I didn't bring my boots.

02:50.104 --> 02:51.236
I had it all packed.

02:51.238 --> 02:53.238
[man speaking]

02:53.240 --> 02:55.641
[man] I don't know
how am I going to make it?

02:55.643 --> 02:58.043
[man speaking]

02:58.045 --> 03:01.046
[music]

03:07.087 --> 03:09.521
[andy]
<i>  my family just got bigger.</i>

03:09.523 --> 03:10.789
<i>  Need that money.</i>

03:27.241 --> 03:29.641
[air hissing]

03:29.643 --> 03:31.810
andy, we just got
to keep the operation going

03:31.812 --> 03:34.079
while kris is away
or you know what'll happen.

03:35.816 --> 03:39.985
[andy speaking]

03:39.987 --> 03:42.054
yeah. You're an uncle,
I'm a grandfather now.

03:42.056 --> 03:43.822
Yeah. Wow.
This is great.

03:43.824 --> 03:45.057
<i> [andy] yeah.</i>

03:46.493 --> 03:48.026
<i> [brad] how's it looking, andy?</i>

03:49.563 --> 03:51.363
[andy] it's looking good.

03:51.365 --> 03:53.465
<i> [brad] take your time,</i>
<i>  just work the material.</i>

03:53.467 --> 03:54.967
[andy] I am.

03:58.672 --> 04:00.405
<i> [brad] what material</i>
<i>  are you seeing, andy?</i>

04:00.407 --> 04:05.344
[andy speaking]

04:05.346 --> 04:06.745
[andy] oh.

04:09.516 --> 04:10.782
-Hey, pop.
<i> -[brad] what?</i>

04:10.784 --> 04:14.086
[andy speaking]

04:17.524 --> 04:19.224
keep working
that wall of gold, andy,

04:19.226 --> 04:21.093
I love to hear that.

04:21.095 --> 04:24.763
<i>  Put that gold in the box,</i>
<i>  that's all that matters andy.</i>

04:24.765 --> 04:26.531
[andy] oh yeah, there we go.

04:28.469 --> 04:32.704
<i> [brad] make sure your brother</i>
<i> won a big clean out this time.</i>

04:32.706 --> 04:35.874
<i> [narrator] while</i>
<i>  the kelly's skeleton team</i>
<i>  gets on the gold,</i>

04:35.876 --> 04:37.509
<i>  11 miles east.</i>

04:41.382 --> 04:43.181
[vernon]
we got to get some gold today.

04:44.118 --> 04:46.451
Got everything thought out.

04:46.453 --> 04:49.021
<i>  We've got some good ground</i>
<i>  to work on.</i>

04:49.023 --> 04:51.790
We've got to take advantage
of every minute.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.660
[narrator]
<i>  vernon adkison enters</i>
<i>  the home stretch,</i>

04:54.662 --> 04:58.063
<i>  and he's stretching</i>
<i>  his operation</i>
<i>  as far as it'll reach.</i>

04:59.133 --> 05:03.835
The deal is we want
to stay on this much longer.

05:03.837 --> 05:07.906
We had a 40-foot hose,
which by the time you
get down to the bottom,

05:07.908 --> 05:12.044
it's only
about a 20-foot radius
to work in.

05:12.046 --> 05:15.113
<i>  We put another 15 feet</i>
<i>  on the hose,</i>

05:15.115 --> 05:17.616
<i>  a lot more area,</i>
<i>  three times as much area,</i>

05:18.552 --> 05:21.953
which means we'll have
to move three times fast.

05:23.223 --> 05:26.224
<i>  This season has been balls</i>
<i>  to the wall fantastic.</i>

05:26.226 --> 05:30.262
And now
we're on what's probably
the best gold of my career.

05:30.264 --> 05:33.665
That's why we're calling it
primo gold.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.669
I'm thinking
we'll got more gold
doing it this way.

05:37.671 --> 05:40.172
I did not want to move again.

05:40.174 --> 05:43.575
Problem is, the gold trail
is going straight towards

05:43.577 --> 05:46.111
that open water lead out there

05:46.113 --> 05:48.180
<i>  and we've already</i>
<i>  tapped out this hole.</i>

05:48.182 --> 05:51.450
<i> Honestly, that lead is getting</i>
<i>  bigger every day</i>

05:51.452 --> 05:54.186
<i>  and the ice</i>
<i>  is getting thinner.</i>

05:54.188 --> 05:57.222
It's not safe to move
any closer to that lead.

05:57.224 --> 05:59.991
<i>  But I can put an extension</i>
<i>  on this hose</i>

05:59.993 --> 06:01.993
<i>  and get my diver closer.</i>

06:01.995 --> 06:03.962
Let's keep
the good times coming.

06:05.366 --> 06:06.932
Bam!

06:06.934 --> 06:09.801
<i> [vernon] having a diver</i>
<i>  this far from the hole,</i>

06:09.803 --> 06:13.772
especially this close
to the lead is very risky,

06:13.774 --> 06:16.508
but we're aiming
for 200 ounces

06:16.510 --> 06:18.944
and I'm going to press
our luck.

06:18.946 --> 06:20.679
[gary] there's a lot of gold
down there.

06:20.681 --> 06:23.081
I'm looking forward
to the dive today,

06:23.083 --> 06:24.649
it'd probably be a marathon.

06:24.651 --> 06:26.952
[vernon] all right, gary.

06:26.954 --> 06:28.220
-[laughs] yeah.
-I like it.

06:29.423 --> 06:31.256
Big money today.

06:38.098 --> 06:39.464
[gary speaking]

06:41.068 --> 06:42.634
good.

06:43.036 --> 06:44.436
<i>  Diver's down.</i>

06:50.577 --> 06:53.078
<i>  Gary, good time.</i>
<i>  Good time, gary.</i>

06:53.080 --> 06:56.148
Be a little bit
extra careful
with that extension.

06:56.150 --> 06:58.417
[gary speaking]

06:58.419 --> 07:02.854
<i> [vernon] the suction,</i>
<i>  does it feel about</i>
<i>  the same or less or what?</i>

07:02.856 --> 07:06.091
[gary speaking]

07:11.432 --> 07:14.900
the more suction,
the more material
you can move,

07:14.902 --> 07:19.171
so by adding the extra length
to the hose,

07:19.173 --> 07:21.573
<i>  we sacrifice some suction.</i>

07:21.575 --> 07:27.312
<i>  It took that much further,</i>
<i>  our system has to pull</i>
<i>  the material.</i>

07:27.314 --> 07:33.485
But I'm hoping
we'll be able to, to function.

07:40.294 --> 07:42.260
So, gary,
tell me about the bottom,

07:42.262 --> 07:44.129
what are you seeing
down there.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.297
[gary] uh...

07:45.999 --> 07:48.567
[gary speaking]

08:02.616 --> 08:04.282
[vernon]
<i>  oh, hell, that's great man.</i>

08:04.284 --> 08:05.317
<i>  That's perfect.</i>

08:05.319 --> 08:08.954
[gary speaking]

08:08.956 --> 08:14.025
oh, that, that is sweet.
Very, very sweet.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.627
[gary speaking]

08:15.629 --> 08:19.631
[vernon] so far, it looks like
there's something,

08:19.633 --> 08:21.233
<i>  knocking on wood.</i>

08:21.235 --> 08:23.235
[gary] whoa, yeah.

08:24.171 --> 08:26.238
<i> [vernon] all right.</i>
<i>  Play it up.</i>

08:26.240 --> 08:28.940
We don't have much time
left in this season,

08:28.942 --> 08:31.977
so we got to make
hay while the sun shines.

08:31.979 --> 08:33.879
[gary] roger that, vernon.

08:33.881 --> 08:38.116
Leave no gold behind,
just suck it up.

08:40.954 --> 08:42.487
<i> [narrator] ten miles west.</i>

08:48.962 --> 08:50.295
[shawn]
<i>  beautiful day in godiva,</i>

08:50.297 --> 08:55.133
but we have to get
as much time
on the bottom as possible,

08:55.135 --> 08:58.670
figure out exactly
which direction
this gold's headed.

08:58.672 --> 09:01.673
[narrator]
<i>  the end of winter mining</i>
<i>  is fast approaching.</i>

09:01.675 --> 09:03.275
<i>  And shawn pomrenke believes</i>

09:03.277 --> 09:07.145
<i>  he's finally</i>
<i>  on to a storied jackpot,</i>

09:07.147 --> 09:11.216
<i> lurking on an ancient riverbed</i>
<i>  on the tomcod claim.</i>

09:13.587 --> 09:17.122
I've seen really good gold,
where I was diving,

09:17.124 --> 09:21.927
going to head down
and see if that thing
continues to the west,

09:21.929 --> 09:26.998
that big pile of gold.
There's gonna be a big
pile out there somewhere.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.600
<i>  Season's almost over.</i>

09:28.602 --> 09:31.603
I still need 45 ounces
to make all my payments,

09:31.605 --> 09:34.339
so I need to pinpoint
this jackpot.

09:34.341 --> 09:35.507
Oh, yeah.

09:35.509 --> 09:37.208
<i>  Last time I used</i>
<i>  the dowsing rods,</i>

09:37.210 --> 09:39.978
<i>  I got</i>
<i> one of the most promising gold</i>
<i>  I've seen yet.</i>

09:39.980 --> 09:42.547
This is the spot.
I'm feeling good.

09:42.549 --> 09:46.818
[shawn speaking]

09:46.820 --> 09:48.353
<i>  I took a big gamble hunting</i>

09:48.355 --> 09:51.289
for it this winter
instead of playing it safe,

09:51.291 --> 09:53.224
but I have faith, in the end,

09:53.226 --> 09:55.060
it'll prove to be
the right move.

10:00.300 --> 10:04.202
<i>  Got the hot water on.</i>
<i>  Till we find some gold,</i>

10:04.204 --> 10:05.303
we're not giving up.

10:05.305 --> 10:07.706
We're going to keep on
fighting for it.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.107
<i>  We'll get it.</i>

10:17.351 --> 10:18.483
<i>  Fix me up.</i>

10:18.485 --> 10:21.086
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Good job closing up here.

10:21.088 --> 10:22.621
[shawn] thank you.

10:22.623 --> 10:25.690
Time is ticking.
Failure is not an option.

10:25.692 --> 10:27.058
<i>  I won't accept it.</i>

10:27.060 --> 10:29.160
I'm the top guy up here
for a reason.

10:29.162 --> 10:31.930
I plan on keeping that streak
intact this winter.

10:31.932 --> 10:33.298
We're running out of time.

10:33.300 --> 10:34.966
We've got to make
the best of this.

and where we're at is right

12:40.260 --> 12:43.561
about at
the southern boundary,
where

12:43.563 --> 12:45.196
<i>  shawn shoveled a whole bunch.</i>

12:45.198 --> 12:46.331
<i>  We found a little spot</i>

12:46.333 --> 12:48.066
<i>  and it's just</i>
<i>  over to the west.</i>

12:48.068 --> 12:51.469
<i>  He doesn't have any record</i>
<i>  of the christine rose having</i>
<i>  shoveled right there.</i>

12:51.471 --> 12:53.371
<i>  It may be a little too deep</i>
<i>  for the christine rose,</i>

12:53.373 --> 12:55.406
<i>  so I think that's a good</i>
<i>  next step for us.</i>

12:55.408 --> 12:57.776
<i> [narrator] zeke tenhoff sees</i>
<i>  his last chance,</i>

12:57.778 --> 12:59.277
<i>  as his best chance.</i>

13:00.380 --> 13:02.347
-All right.
-Let's go shovel, boys.

13:02.349 --> 13:03.448
[man 4] shovel.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.116
[zeke]
<i>  this season has been brutal.</i>

13:05.118 --> 13:07.318
<i>  We basically have no gold.</i>

13:07.320 --> 13:09.988
We've moved over to
the coveted tomcod claim,

13:09.990 --> 13:11.890
but we're still
coming up empty.

13:11.892 --> 13:14.826
But finally,
some positive vibes
are coming our way.

13:14.828 --> 13:16.027
<i>  Shawn gave us</i>
<i>  some coordinates</i>

13:16.029 --> 13:18.196
<i>  where he hasn't mined yet.</i>

13:18.198 --> 13:20.498
<i>  That probably means</i>
<i>  that there's some gold there.</i>

13:20.500 --> 13:22.000
<i>  If there is,</i>
<i>  we can get enough gold</i>

13:22.002 --> 13:24.536
to save our season
and keep the operation going.

13:32.012 --> 13:35.046
Look at all this water,
it just poured out of here.
Damn!

13:38.418 --> 13:41.553
[zeke speaking]

13:42.923 --> 13:46.157
...Causing the ice
to be pressed down
under the water level,

13:46.159 --> 13:49.227
and it's just, it's not ideal.

13:49.229 --> 13:51.830
<i>  This is the challenge</i>
<i>  for the last days of winter.</i>

13:51.832 --> 13:53.464
<i>  We're on what should be</i>
<i>  promising ground,</i>

13:53.466 --> 13:55.533
<i>  but we have massive overflow.</i>

13:55.535 --> 13:58.036
<i>  All this water is weighing</i>
<i>  down on the ice,</i>

13:58.038 --> 13:59.971
<i>  which is already pretty thin</i>
<i>  and weak</i>

13:59.973 --> 14:01.539
<i>  and could easily break apart.</i>

14:01.541 --> 14:04.142
We set up out here
and the ice collapses,

14:04.144 --> 14:06.211
like, us
and all of our equipment
could drop

14:06.213 --> 14:07.378
into the bottom of the sea.

14:07.380 --> 14:10.081
<i>  But there's nothing I can do</i>
<i>  about this overflow.</i>

14:10.083 --> 14:12.217
But I'm just going to set up
in this big pool of water

14:12.219 --> 14:13.284
and hope it works out.

14:13.286 --> 14:14.686
I don't have a choice.

14:17.757 --> 14:21.926
I'm trying to get a hole
through this watery ice
in this big puddle,

14:21.928 --> 14:24.596
and it looks like a chainsaw
is making pretty short work
of it.

14:24.598 --> 14:28.433
We can get our block free
and get a get a hole open,

14:28.435 --> 14:31.169
then we'll pull the sluice
right into it,

14:31.171 --> 14:33.071
<i>  we'll see how it works out.</i>

14:33.073 --> 14:36.207
<i>  I didn't anticipate</i>
<i>  being in water like this,</i>

14:36.209 --> 14:38.443
so it's going to be
a challenge.

14:42.148 --> 14:44.749
[screaming]

14:50.891 --> 14:52.991
<i> [zeke] everything is in place,</i>

14:52.993 --> 14:57.695
<i>  so there's no reason</i>
<i>  why I shouldn't be</i>
<i>  able to dive on this.</i>

14:57.697 --> 14:59.497
<i>  This whole setup</i>
<i>  is kind of crazy,</i>

14:59.499 --> 15:00.531
but this is it.

15:00.533 --> 15:02.600
I got to find some gold here.
It's over.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.271
We need to catch
a break here and get
into some gold for sure.

15:23.623 --> 15:26.324
[zeke speaking]

15:30.363 --> 15:33.097
[man 5] what's the ground
look like down there by?

15:33.099 --> 15:35.700
[zeke speaking]

15:54.988 --> 15:56.487
but these are all good signs.

15:58.024 --> 16:01.025
[zeke speaking]

16:26.086 --> 16:28.152
all right. That sounds great.

16:28.154 --> 16:31.289
[zeke] this is good stuff.
It's actually
pretty phenomenal.

16:33.159 --> 16:35.159
I love to hear it.

16:35.161 --> 16:37.829
[zeke] I'm seeing some
pieces of gold now.

16:37.831 --> 16:39.297
Yeah.

16:39.299 --> 16:40.565
Thank god.

16:42.202 --> 16:43.801
<i> [man 4] 40 ounces of gold.</i>

<i> [narrator] two miles east...</i>

17:00.020 --> 17:01.386
<i> [brad] what's happening, andy?</i>

17:01.388 --> 17:02.787
You're on pretty good
gold there?

17:02.789 --> 17:04.122
<i> [andy] yeah.</i>

17:04.124 --> 17:05.656
I got

17:05.658 --> 17:11.095
flower gold all right here
and then I got
the bigger pieces over here.

17:11.097 --> 17:13.331
[brad]
<i>  you're kidding me.</i>
<i>  You hitting like that?</i>

17:13.333 --> 17:15.400
<i> [andy] I got gold off [bleep].</i>

17:15.402 --> 17:16.801
<i> [narrator] no kris?</i>

17:16.803 --> 17:21.406
<i>  No problem,</i>
<i>  as andy kelly is knee deep</i>
<i>  in the good stuff.</i>

17:21.408 --> 17:22.774
[andy] really good gold.

17:22.776 --> 17:25.309
<i> [brad] come on, andy.</i>
<i>  Lead us to victory.</i>

17:25.311 --> 17:26.778
<i>  We're on big gold right now.</i>

17:26.780 --> 17:28.346
<i>  Coarse gold, fine gold.</i>

17:28.348 --> 17:29.914
Andy,
everything is running smooth.

17:29.916 --> 17:31.849
This is how we need to run
every day.

17:31.851 --> 17:34.519
[andy speaking]

17:37.123 --> 17:41.459
andy's on gold right now
and there's chunkies
on one side,

17:41.461 --> 17:42.627
fine on the other.

17:42.629 --> 17:45.363
So what more can you ask for,
except for pounds...

17:47.200 --> 17:49.500
Are you hungry? You want me
to start barbecuing?

17:49.502 --> 17:51.536
[andy speaking]

17:51.538 --> 17:52.970
okay. Come on, andy.

17:52.972 --> 17:55.206
This shift's over for you.
Come on back up.

18:02.115 --> 18:04.115
You did a good job.

18:04.117 --> 18:06.217
Well, what do you know,
kris is gone and we're having

18:06.219 --> 18:07.919
the best day
of the season yet.

18:07.921 --> 18:09.954
Sometimes you just got
to get that bad [bleep]
out of the way

18:09.956 --> 18:11.255
and things come together.

18:12.992 --> 18:14.025
<i>  So here's the deal,</i>

18:14.027 --> 18:15.827
<i>  we're going to get</i>
<i>  more hours on the box.</i>

18:15.829 --> 18:18.296
We're bringing a guy
to pull in the second shift.

18:18.298 --> 18:21.566
I hear he's good,
so hopefully,
he keeps the gold flowing.

18:21.568 --> 18:24.535
Kris calls me,
said he had a baby,

18:24.537 --> 18:27.572
so I said,
"well, I'm in to help."

18:27.574 --> 18:30.942
<i>  I need to redeem</i>
<i>  myself for the last one.</i>

18:30.944 --> 18:32.910
<i> [narrator] if mikel henry</i>
<i>  looks familiar,</i>

18:32.912 --> 18:35.580
<i>  you may remember him</i>
<i>  from his short stint</i>
<i>  with vernon,</i>

18:35.582 --> 18:38.516
<i>  which didn't go so hot.</i>

18:39.519 --> 18:42.620
[mikel] oh, vernon,
I didn't have any hot water,

18:42.622 --> 18:44.589
so I had to come up
three times...

18:44.591 --> 18:47.058
[mikel speaking]

18:47.060 --> 18:48.926
oh, [bleep] damn it.

18:48.928 --> 18:51.062
[mikel speaking]

18:51.064 --> 18:55.133
<i> [mikel] I just sat there</i>
<i>  and froze for over 15 minutes</i>
<i>  trying to get this done.</i>

18:55.135 --> 18:57.168
He's aggravating
the [bleep] out of me.

18:57.170 --> 18:58.469
<i>  We're done.</i>

18:58.471 --> 19:01.239
And here I am.

19:01.241 --> 19:03.040
<i> [man 5] one thing</i>
<i>  I have to say about mikel,</i>

19:03.042 --> 19:05.042
the weights on his boots.

19:05.044 --> 19:07.211
He brought
his own weights though.

19:07.213 --> 19:11.482
That's an indication
that he possibly could know
what the [bleep] he's doing.

19:12.752 --> 19:13.918
Don't show
these young guys that.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.720
They will feel real bad
if you show 'em up, okay?

19:15.722 --> 19:17.722
-All right.
<i> -[man 5] </i>
<i> are you ready to go?</i>

19:17.724 --> 19:18.990
<i> [mikel] yes.</i>

19:34.974 --> 19:37.074
[mikel speaking]

19:37.076 --> 19:38.209
[man speaking]

19:38.211 --> 19:39.510
[brad speaking]

19:42.549 --> 19:44.315
it's right
where that nozzle is.

19:46.319 --> 19:48.686
[mikel speaking]

19:50.156 --> 19:51.455
[brad]
are you seeing any gold?

19:51.457 --> 19:54.225
That's the most
important thing of all.

19:54.227 --> 19:58.095
[mikel speaking]

19:59.432 --> 20:01.999
andy's saying,
do you have your glasses on?

20:05.205 --> 20:06.671
Yeah.

20:06.673 --> 20:08.139
[andy speaking]

20:08.141 --> 20:10.107
don't look for chunkies,
it's all flower.

20:10.109 --> 20:11.342
Just work it out, mike.

20:12.612 --> 20:14.679
[mikel speaking]

20:28.161 --> 20:29.260
[brad] lots of quartz.

20:29.262 --> 20:31.495
-[andy] I know.
-[brad] that's a good sign.

20:31.497 --> 20:34.165
[mikel speaking]

20:34.167 --> 20:35.366
[brad]
things are going smooth.

20:35.368 --> 20:37.535
I mean, there's no problems
with mike so far,

20:37.537 --> 20:41.005
<i>  he's sucking up the material,</i>
<i>  everything's going real good.</i>

20:45.245 --> 20:48.779
[mikel speaking]

20:53.052 --> 20:56.020
just pee,
go pee real quick, mike.

20:56.022 --> 20:58.522
[andy speaking]

20:58.524 --> 21:00.424
<i> [brad] come on, mike,</i>
<i>  you're doing good.</i>

21:00.426 --> 21:02.660
<i>  You got</i>
<i>  lots of material flowing</i>
<i>  through the box.</i>

21:04.163 --> 21:05.563
[mikel speaking]

21:13.339 --> 21:14.772
[brad] are you [bleep] real?

21:17.310 --> 21:19.343
[brad]
<i>  it's like two minutes in.</i>

21:19.345 --> 21:21.779
[mikel speaking]

21:35.895 --> 21:36.994
well, that sucked.

21:36.996 --> 21:38.929
The jackass got cold
after five minutes.

21:38.931 --> 21:40.097
What the [bleep].

21:40.099 --> 21:42.133
<i> [mikel] I'm diving</i>
<i>  same way as andy,</i>

21:42.135 --> 21:46.671
and it just wasn't enough
for water to get down in
and stay in the boot.

21:46.673 --> 21:48.906
Maybe we should have
had mike dive in a hot tub.

21:48.908 --> 21:50.641
It was a complete
waste of time.

21:50.643 --> 21:51.809
So when I was down there,

21:51.811 --> 21:53.878
I got enough for the day
to make it profitable,

21:53.880 --> 21:55.846
<i>  so it wasn't a total loss.</i>

21:55.848 --> 21:58.215
<i>  He's not diving</i>
<i>  with us anymore,</i>
<i>  I can't have him.</i>

21:58.217 --> 21:59.450
Let's go
and come back tomorrow,

21:59.452 --> 22:01.085

<i> [narrator] after four hours</i>

22:50.970 --> 22:54.472
We're on the best ground
that you can imagine.

22:54.474 --> 22:56.574
Very little overburden,

22:56.576 --> 23:00.678
there's gold in the two
or three inches of overburden
there is down there.

23:02.014 --> 23:04.982
It doesn't get
any sweeter than this.

23:04.984 --> 23:07.518
A lot of people
who looked out there
at that lead

23:07.520 --> 23:10.621
and said "the hell with it"
and hightailed out of there.

23:10.623 --> 23:13.391
But I'm a greedy
son of a bitch.

23:13.393 --> 23:15.926
If I'm on great gold
and there's something standing

23:15.928 --> 23:18.028

from getting more,

<i>  you can bet your bippy,</i>

25:05.805 --> 25:08.172
[shawn speaking]

25:14.647 --> 25:15.746
perfect.

25:17.383 --> 25:19.483
[shawn speaking]

25:52.785 --> 25:55.653
let me see if I can get
you a little more umbilical.

25:55.655 --> 25:58.422
[shawn speaking]

26:09.035 --> 26:10.668
I think
that's about all we got.

26:18.477 --> 26:21.211
[shawn speaking]

26:21.213 --> 26:24.081
yeah, sounds good.
Where at, you reckon?

26:24.083 --> 26:26.817
[shawn]
<i>  probably, here right north.</i>

26:26.819 --> 26:31.021
All right. We'll all just
auger a hole and I'll tie
a rope to that one, red hook,

26:31.023 --> 26:32.856
<i>  drop her down,</i>
<i>  so we can find you.</i>

26:32.858 --> 26:34.792
[shawn] okay.

26:34.794 --> 26:37.461
<i> [man 2] shawn's stretched out</i>
<i>  into the drift right now,</i>

26:37.463 --> 26:39.463
we're going to see
if we can find him.

26:39.465 --> 26:41.799
<i>  That will give us</i>
<i>  a little bit of an idea</i>

26:41.801 --> 26:43.334
<i>  where we want to do</i>
<i>  our next dive hole.</i>

26:44.437 --> 26:46.770
[driller whirring]

27:01.320 --> 27:03.454
we're going to tie
a rope to this hook here,

27:03.456 --> 27:04.822
and we'll lower it down
the hole

27:04.824 --> 27:07.157
we just augured
and see if shawn can find it.

27:07.159 --> 27:09.393
He's seeing some really
good gold over this way.

27:11.230 --> 27:13.263
Here goes.

27:13.265 --> 27:15.899
Well, right here.
You almost hit me.

27:15.901 --> 27:17.134
[shawn laughing]

27:18.971 --> 27:22.006
I got a few
air bubbles coming up
out of the hole here.

27:22.008 --> 27:23.674
Looks like
he might be in the vicinity.

27:23.676 --> 27:25.242
[shawn] there it is.

27:29.382 --> 27:31.081
You get a hold
of that hook down there.

27:31.083 --> 27:33.150
[shawn] ...Yeah.
You're good, buddy.

27:33.152 --> 27:36.120
That... Just pulled
on top of my head.

27:36.122 --> 27:39.023
You drilled it
right in the right spot.

27:39.025 --> 27:42.192
Booyah, that's right
where we want to go, eh?

27:42.194 --> 27:45.663
[shawn] yeah, that's exactly
where we want to move to.

27:45.665 --> 27:48.632
Ah, perfect.
Excellent.

27:48.634 --> 27:50.000
[shawn] I'm out of here.

27:56.642 --> 27:58.976
<i> [shawn] gold is scorching</i>
<i>  hot at the end,</i>

27:58.978 --> 28:01.812
it kills me that my umbilical
couldn't reach further,

28:01.814 --> 28:03.947
this jackpot keeps teasing me.

28:05.951 --> 28:08.419
<i>  At least now I know</i>
<i> where the crazy good stuff is,</i>

28:08.421 --> 28:10.087
<i> and we'll have the hole ready.</i>

28:10.089 --> 28:13.123
<i>  Only thing is I don't know</i>
<i>  how much time we have left.</i>

28:13.125 --> 28:16.093
Whatever the bering sea gods
have in store for us,

28:16.095 --> 28:17.294
I'll be ready.

28:17.296 --> 28:19.930
I stretched out
all the way down
to my line.

28:19.932 --> 28:21.932
<i>  There's a bunch of gold</i>
<i>  right there.</i>

28:21.934 --> 28:24.968
There's going to be
some gold in that hole.

28:24.970 --> 28:26.603
<i>  We're going to keep</i>
<i>  fighting for it.</i>

28:40.152 --> 28:41.685
Hey,
how you doing down there, bud?

28:43.622 --> 28:46.590
[zeke speaking]

28:51.997 --> 28:54.064
<i> [gabe] you're perfecting</i>
<i>  the art of this whole thing,</i>

28:54.066 --> 28:55.666
<i>  punching around.</i>

28:55.668 --> 29:00.604
This is the area that shawn
kind of gave us the okay
that the shovels didn't hit.

29:00.606 --> 29:03.340
<i>  Now at least we have</i>
<i>  some good looking ground.</i>

29:04.410 --> 29:06.977
<i> [narrator] after nearly</i>
<i>  six hours down below,</i>

29:06.979 --> 29:09.747
<i>  zeke's last ditch effort</i>
<i>  is paying off.</i>

29:12.084 --> 29:16.053
[zeke speaking]

29:31.003 --> 29:33.003
right. Well, that's great.

29:33.005 --> 29:34.438
<i>  Now we're onto something.</i>

29:35.641 --> 29:40.244
[zeke speaking]

29:55.694 --> 29:56.960
yeah, come on up.

29:56.962 --> 29:58.595
We got
lots of work left to do.

29:58.597 --> 30:00.097
[zeke] okay.

30:00.099 --> 30:02.032
[zeke speaking]

30:04.403 --> 30:05.803
[gabe] yeah.

30:06.539 --> 30:08.105
Ye-hee-hee-hee!

30:13.345 --> 30:15.012
How you feeling?

30:15.014 --> 30:16.446
Good.
I'm over the moon.

30:16.448 --> 30:17.548
That is awesome.

30:17.550 --> 30:20.250
You gave the direction
and you do--

30:20.252 --> 30:22.553
[zeke speaking]

30:24.423 --> 30:25.989
[zeke]
dude, that could've gone
a lot of ways,

30:25.991 --> 30:29.827
it's really like really hot,
it really could have.

30:29.829 --> 30:33.530
I feel vindicated.
I feel relief and hope.

30:33.532 --> 30:34.832
<i>  We're on some gold.</i>

30:34.834 --> 30:36.767
<i>  It's not just a few specks</i>
<i>  at gold.</i>

30:36.769 --> 30:38.335
<i>  It's really good gold.</i>

30:38.337 --> 30:41.271
<i>  It may be the 11th hour,</i>
<i>  but we're definitely on it.</i>

30:41.273 --> 30:44.541
Now we've just got to milk
it for as long as
mother nature will allow.

30:44.543 --> 30:46.777
[indistinct chatter]

30:47.947 --> 30:49.112
yeah.

30:51.283 --> 30:52.583
<i> [narrator] back in nome.</i>

30:58.057 --> 31:00.224
[shawn] no, it's there.

31:00.226 --> 31:01.525
Sooner or later,

31:01.527 --> 31:03.327
there's nuggets
in this dirt pouring

31:03.329 --> 31:05.262
out of
the, out of the gravels

31:05.264 --> 31:09.633
or they're just going to be
like a slab of gold in there.

31:11.503 --> 31:14.037
I got it.
Put her on the scale.

31:14.039 --> 31:16.907
That was easily
the hottest gold I've been
in this season.

31:16.909 --> 31:18.842
<i>  Only got a few hours on it.</i>

31:18.844 --> 31:20.410
<i>  But if this is a big number,</i>

31:20.412 --> 31:22.980
it can mean
the rest of the season
is going to be massive.

31:24.250 --> 31:25.482
See what we got.

31:28.187 --> 31:31.788
Four, five, six, seven,

31:31.790 --> 31:35.359
eight, nine, 10, 11,

31:40.232 --> 31:43.066
17.40.

31:43.068 --> 31:44.234
Oh, yeah.

31:44.236 --> 31:45.802
Perfect.

31:47.172 --> 31:51.308
<i> [narrator] 17.4 ounces</i>
<i>  is worth over $30,000,</i>

31:51.310 --> 31:55.646
<i> a hefty haul for a limited day</i>
<i>  and quite possibly</i>

31:55.648 --> 31:57.681
<i>  the sign of bigger things</i>
<i>  to come.</i>

31:57.683 --> 32:00.083
<i> [shawn] we need to keep it up.</i>

32:00.085 --> 32:01.551
<i>  This is looking good.</i>

32:01.553 --> 32:03.220
Complete confirmation.

32:03.222 --> 32:05.656
This spot's exactly
what we've been looking for.

32:05.658 --> 32:07.224
I just need mother nature

32:07.226 --> 32:09.059
to cooperate
a little bit longer.

32:09.061 --> 32:11.128
<i>  These numbers</i>
<i>  are going to get sick.</i>

32:11.130 --> 32:12.496
I'm talking nuggets.

32:12.498 --> 32:14.031
I'm thinking it's that good.

32:14.033 --> 32:15.599
We're definitely on the trail.

32:15.601 --> 32:17.534
-Mm-hmm.
-Oh, yeah.

32:17.536 --> 32:19.636
-We'll come across it.
-We'll get on it.

32:22.274 --> 32:23.774
[narrator]
<i>  on the other side of town.</i>

32:26.478 --> 32:28.145
[andy]
<i>  take a look what we got.</i>

32:29.248 --> 32:31.515
[andy speaking]

32:31.517 --> 32:33.050
oh, yeah.

32:33.052 --> 32:35.953
[narrator]
<i>  after their new diver</i>
<i>  left them out in the cold,</i>

32:35.955 --> 32:39.523
it's time
for the kris-less kellys
to weigh their riches.

32:39.525 --> 32:41.892
[andy] good job.
Let's see.

32:41.894 --> 32:44.394
So mikel was a complete
waste of time jackass

32:44.396 --> 32:46.997
before his epic
five-minute dive,

32:46.999 --> 32:50.133
I knew
I was on some really hot stuff
and it's been peaceful

32:50.135 --> 32:52.135
with my brother being gone
and out of our hair.

32:53.439 --> 32:55.505
Okay.
Go.

32:55.507 --> 32:57.140
[brad] hopefully,
I'm happy with this.

32:57.142 --> 32:59.476
One-and-a-half,
two, two-and-a-half.

32:59.478 --> 33:01.678
<i> [andy] still keeping</i>
<i>  the operation running.</i>

33:01.680 --> 33:04.614
[brad] three,
three-and-a-half, four,

33:04.616 --> 33:06.650
four-and-a-half, five--

33:06.652 --> 33:08.018
six.

33:09.588 --> 33:11.788
Almost six-and-a-half ounces,
you did real good.

33:11.790 --> 33:13.190
Proud of you.

33:13.192 --> 33:18.428
<i> [narrator] 6.43 ounces</i>
<i>  is worth just over $12,000.</i>

33:18.430 --> 33:21.598
<i>  And despite the absence</i>
<i>  of their fearless leader,</i>

33:21.600 --> 33:25.402
<i>  the kelly's have hit</i>
<i>  their season goal</i>
<i>  of 25 ounces,</i>

33:25.404 --> 33:29.406
<i> getting themselves out of debt</i>
<i>  and into the black.</i>

33:29.408 --> 33:30.507
They'll be happy [bleep].

33:30.509 --> 33:31.808
[brad speaking]

33:31.810 --> 33:34.511
no, pour it back in the jar
and hand me the jar [bleep].

33:34.513 --> 33:35.779
[brad] I was just checking...

33:35.781 --> 33:36.780
-Yeah.
-We're not...

33:36.782 --> 33:38.215
[brad] I wasn't
really going to take it,

33:38.217 --> 33:39.349
I'm just seeing
if you are into it.

33:39.351 --> 33:40.484
No.

33:40.486 --> 33:42.486
So a shocker,
my brother goes to anchorage

33:42.488 --> 33:44.755
to deal with all his [bleep]
and everything else,

33:44.757 --> 33:46.656
<i> and we had the best clean out.</i>

33:46.658 --> 33:47.891
<i>  We hit our goal.</i>

33:47.893 --> 33:50.627
Get rid of the negativity,
and everything's good.

33:50.629 --> 33:52.262
[brad] okay.
Let's get out of here.

33:55.034 --> 33:56.466
<i> [andy] yeah,</i>
<i>  that's the real deal.</i>

34:01.707 --> 34:05.409
<i> [narrator] and now,</i>
<i>  bering sea gold</i>
<i>  goes to the dogs.</i>

34:05.411 --> 34:06.743
<i> [brad] here comes my dog.</i>

34:08.047 --> 34:09.446
Here he comes.
[whistles]

34:09.448 --> 34:10.514
come on, boy.

34:10.516 --> 34:12.015
Good boy.

34:14.787 --> 34:17.354
<i> [gabe] stormy! Come here, boy!</i>

34:18.457 --> 34:21.425
Yeah, he's probably over
at the kelly's.

34:22.961 --> 34:25.829
...Only knows what he gets up
to over there.

34:25.831 --> 34:28.065
<i>  Drinking cheap beer...</i>

34:28.067 --> 34:29.633
[man 7] come here, boy.
Come on.

34:29.635 --> 34:34.671
Hi, beautiful.
Pretty good, baby.

34:34.673 --> 34:36.073
Oh, he's hungry.

34:36.075 --> 34:38.675
Yeah, he is.
There you go.

34:38.677 --> 34:40.677
The new addition
to the reaper crew.

34:42.081 --> 34:43.480
Hi, beautiful.

34:43.482 --> 34:45.148
He's a good-looking dog, eh?

34:45.150 --> 34:48.351
-Yeah.
-There you go. [bleep]

34:48.353 --> 34:50.821
I can't help it,
man. I love animals.

34:50.823 --> 34:52.656
-[man 7]
you want another hotdog?
-[man 8] yeah.

34:52.658 --> 34:54.391
Stormy
is zeke's little mascot.

34:54.393 --> 34:55.459
Don't worry, zeke,

34:55.461 --> 34:57.327
we're feeding
your dog for you.

34:57.329 --> 34:58.962
Stormy loves
being at the reaper,

34:58.964 --> 35:01.131
because we feed him
smokeys, hamburgers.

35:01.133 --> 35:02.899
And yeah, we take
good care of that dog.

35:02.901 --> 35:05.435
I think the dog gained
another 10 pounds this season.

35:05.437 --> 35:07.337
We have special connection
with animals.

35:07.339 --> 35:10.774
The kellys are
serious animal lovers.

35:10.776 --> 35:13.143
But I'm just worried
that my dad is going to steal
the dog.

35:13.145 --> 35:15.412
[brad] this dog's not liking
the cigarette smoke.

35:15.414 --> 35:19.583
-[andy] well, the dog can get
the [bleep] out then.
-Come on, boy.

35:31.964 --> 35:34.297
<i> [zeke] I mean, that was some</i>
<i>  good gold, that's for sure.</i>

35:34.299 --> 35:36.366
I would see
gold under some rocks

35:36.368 --> 35:38.034
and I would see it
on the clay.

35:38.036 --> 35:39.302
So I'm super stoked.

35:39.304 --> 35:40.937
[narrator]
<i>  as the end of winter looms,</i>

35:40.939 --> 35:42.939
<i>  zeke tenhoff may be breathing</i>

35:42.941 --> 35:45.976
<i>  a life-saving gasp</i>
<i>  into his season.</i>

35:45.978 --> 35:47.544
[zeke]
<i>  there's lots of gold</i>
<i>  out there,</i>

35:47.546 --> 35:49.613
you know, I'd see it under
the gravel and sometimes

35:49.615 --> 35:51.348
I'd see
it on top of the rocks.

35:53.385 --> 35:56.219
Finally,
the season was looking
like it was essentially over,

35:56.221 --> 35:58.788
but we finally got
into some gold on tomcod.

35:58.790 --> 36:00.457
God, this is great.

36:00.459 --> 36:01.992
I love this.

36:01.994 --> 36:04.227
If we can keep
grinding on this pastry,

36:04.229 --> 36:07.364
I think we'll get enough gold
to keep this operation alive.

36:07.366 --> 36:09.499
Fingers crossed.

36:09.501 --> 36:11.201
It's a tidy
little pile of gold here.

36:11.203 --> 36:13.603
I'm not afraid
of this weigh out.

36:13.605 --> 36:15.639
[gabe] all right, here we go.

36:16.275 --> 36:18.275
[speaks indistinctly]

36:18.277 --> 36:21.811
I'd always thought
tomcod had been beat up
and dredged out.

36:21.813 --> 36:24.247
This tells me
that it's clearly not.

36:24.249 --> 36:25.982
It's clearly not.

36:25.984 --> 36:28.685
Yeah, we're up to
almost two ounces here.

36:30.222 --> 36:32.055
All right.
2.94.

36:33.392 --> 36:34.491
That'll do.

36:35.661 --> 36:40.096
<i> [narrator] 2.94 ounces</i>
<i>  is worth over $5,000.</i>

36:40.098 --> 36:42.098
<i>  And while it's not breaking</i>
<i>  the bank,</i>

36:42.100 --> 36:44.801
<i>  it's the mad</i>
<i>  scientist's biggest</i>
<i>  haul of his winter</i>

36:44.803 --> 36:47.904
<i>  and just in the nick of time.</i>

36:47.906 --> 36:51.841
This is my favorite way
to make money.

36:51.843 --> 36:54.611
<i> [zeke] yeah, I'll do solid.</i>
<i>  Hopefully, this keeps up.</i>

36:54.613 --> 36:57.380
I need at least eight ounces
to get through till summer,

36:57.382 --> 37:01.084
and it really doesn't matter
if everything sucked up
until today.

37:01.086 --> 37:03.153
<i>  All it matters</i>
<i>  is the final tally,</i>

37:03.155 --> 37:04.921
when we walk off the ice,

37:04.923 --> 37:06.489
and for the first time
all winter,

37:06.491 --> 37:08.592
I'm starting
to feel optimistic.

37:08.594 --> 37:10.860
It's going to take
another couple of clean -outs
to buy a caddy,

37:10.862 --> 37:14.598
but we'll get there. We will.

37:14.600 --> 37:18.001
<i> [zeke] I like it.</i>
<i>  I'm really happy that shawn</i>
<i>  bought tomcod.</i>

37:18.003 --> 37:20.670
<i>  I could see myself dredging</i>
<i> out there for the next decade.</i>

37:21.873 --> 37:23.173
<i> [narrator] across town.</i>

37:25.210 --> 37:27.177
-[vernon]
<i>  we're still on the gold.</i>
<i> -[man 9] yeah.</i>

37:27.179 --> 37:29.312
Adding an extension on
the hose, that was key.

37:29.314 --> 37:30.981
That gave us
that much more ground.

37:30.983 --> 37:33.516
Three times
as much ground to work.

37:33.518 --> 37:35.852
<i> [narrator] the man</i>
<i>  with the hottest hand in nome</i>

37:35.854 --> 37:38.788
<i>  prepares to weigh</i>
<i>  yet another solid haul.</i>

37:40.225 --> 37:42.325
[vernon]
so, yeah, weigh it up, gary.
Let's see what we got there.

37:42.327 --> 37:43.627
[gary] all right.

37:44.663 --> 37:46.863
[vernon] all right.
Let's go. That's two...

37:46.865 --> 37:49.799
[gary] three, four, five,

37:49.801 --> 37:55.205
six, seven, nine, ten, eleven,

37:55.207 --> 38:01.011
twelve, thirteen,
fifteen, sixteen

38:01.013 --> 38:03.780
seventeen, eighteen...

38:05.550 --> 38:07.083
...Twenty...

38:07.085 --> 38:08.551
[vernon] 20.36.

38:08.553 --> 38:09.819
[gary] all right.

38:10.956 --> 38:14.424
[narrator]
<i>  20 ounces is worth $38,000,</i>

38:14.426 --> 38:18.194
<i>  and the current king of nome</i>
<i>  still has his grip</i>
<i>  on the crown.</i>

38:18.196 --> 38:19.262
We're still on the gold.

38:19.264 --> 38:20.897
-Yeah.
-Okay.

38:20.899 --> 38:25.001
And I think we've got enough
ground left down there
for one more cleanup,

38:25.003 --> 38:27.170
but we don't have time
to move.

38:27.172 --> 38:28.505
When you got it, you got it.

38:28.507 --> 38:30.607
The gold just keeps
getting hotter.

38:30.609 --> 38:32.809
<i>  Everything's going right</i>
<i>  these days.</i>

38:32.811 --> 38:34.210
<i>  If it keeps up like this,</i>

38:34.212 --> 38:36.146
I may have to go over
to tomcod

38:36.148 --> 38:39.115
and give shawn a few tips
on gold getting.

38:39.117 --> 38:43.353
The proof is in the pudding
and there's the pudding
right there, baby.

38:44.890 --> 38:46.022
<i>  We're going to finish</i>
<i>  with a bang,</i>

38:46.024 --> 38:47.324
<i>  looks like to me.</i>

38:48.527 --> 38:50.427
<i> [narrator] while vernon</i>
<i>  hauls in a bundle...</i>

38:52.064 --> 38:53.129
<i> [kris] back in nome.</i>

38:54.232 --> 38:56.633
I got everything else.

38:56.635 --> 38:58.134
[man speaking]

38:58.136 --> 39:01.571
now you
[bleep] start taking bags.

39:01.573 --> 39:05.408
<i> [narrator] kris kelly's back</i>
<i>  with a bundle of his own.</i>

39:05.410 --> 39:08.611
[kris] $1,900
down on baby crap so far.

39:08.613 --> 39:10.647
But that's a drop
in the bucket, I hear.

39:10.649 --> 39:13.383
<i>  Now,</i>
<i>  I'm going to need three times</i>
<i>  the amount of gold.</i>

39:14.786 --> 39:15.919
I'm a dad now.

39:15.921 --> 39:17.120
That's crazy,

39:17.122 --> 39:19.055
but pretty awesome
at the same time.

39:20.425 --> 39:22.158
Hi, my baby.

39:22.160 --> 39:25.428
And here
we are the newest member
to the kellys.

39:25.430 --> 39:27.597
Christine jade kelly.

39:28.567 --> 39:30.400
She even looked at me
when I said it.

39:32.070 --> 39:34.371
In all that time I was gone
and worrying about my dad

39:34.373 --> 39:36.106
and brother
taking care of things,

39:36.108 --> 39:37.273
they crushed it.

39:37.275 --> 39:39.809
Hell, we're out of debt now.
They did so good.

39:41.313 --> 39:42.712
It's a little stressful.

39:42.748 --> 39:46.750
A couple of months of hell
and then hopefully
20 years of happiness.

39:47.986 --> 39:49.185
But you know,
when you look at her,

39:49.187 --> 39:50.987
you know
it's all going to be
worthwhile.

39:50.989 --> 39:53.523
Kris started
his own little family now.

39:53.525 --> 39:55.492
It's perfect.

39:55.494 --> 39:57.694
<i> [kris] I guess in the end,</i>
<i>  you need to rely on family,</i>

39:57.696 --> 39:59.662
<i>  because family relies on you.</i>

39:59.664 --> 40:01.531
That's the only way
to weather this stuff,

40:01.533 --> 40:03.867
what life in mining throws
at you.

40:03.869 --> 40:05.368
Now it's all about the future,

40:05.370 --> 40:07.203
and it's never looked
brighter.

40:07.205 --> 40:08.805
She just looked at me.

40:10.242 --> 40:14.043
I bought enough food
for four children
for three months.

40:14.045 --> 40:15.979
<i>  You're going to feed andy...</i>

40:15.981 --> 40:18.148
<i> [andy] well, you know, like,</i>
<i>  I don't think so.</i>

40:20.285 --> 40:22.419
<i> [narrator] vernon played</i>
<i>  chicken with the lead</i>

40:23.922 --> 40:27.123
<i>  and widens his lead</i>
<i>  over the rest of the fleet.</i>

40:27.125 --> 40:28.224
<i> [vernon] milk it, baby.</i>

40:29.494 --> 40:32.328
[narrator]
<i>  next time</i>
<i>  on bering sea gold...</i>

40:32.330 --> 40:34.497
Basically,
we've cracked the ice

40:34.499 --> 40:38.802
in a complete circle around us
sitting on a chunk of ice,

40:38.804 --> 40:40.937
floating in
the middle of the bering sea.

40:40.939 --> 40:43.173
It could go really bad.

40:43.175 --> 40:45.008
<i> [man 8] there's so much</i>
<i>  snow on the ice,</i>

40:45.010 --> 40:48.077
<i>  it's pushing us down</i>
<i>  and the water's coming up.</i>

40:48.079 --> 40:50.814
<i> [man 9] we're going to flood</i>
<i>  this entire [bleep] area.</i>

40:50.816 --> 40:53.416
[vernon]
<i>  if we can do eight hours,</i>

40:53.418 --> 40:56.286
it'll be the gold gorilla.

40:56.288 --> 40:59.289
[man 10] I'm on the gold,
man, I'm on the gold.

40:59.291 --> 41:01.157
<i> Does gold dust shoot this far?</i>

41:03.295 --> 41:05.428
[man speaking]

41:08.366 --> 41:09.833
[man 10]
move it, move it, move it.

41:09.835 --> 41:11.468
[man speaking]

41:15.006 --> 41:20.276
do hell with gold mining,
nobody said it was going to be
a safe job.
