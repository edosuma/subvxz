Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

00:04.888 --> 00:06.890
Sam, two nights ago on the boat,

00:06.890 --> 00:09.893
you demonstrated in no uncertain terms

00:09.893 --> 00:11.895
that you and I are inevitable.

00:11.895 --> 00:14.898
You said those words I had
hoped to hear for so long,

00:14.898 --> 00:17.267
"Will you marry me?"

00:17.267 --> 00:20.653
Before thinking, I responded no.

00:20.653 --> 00:22.939
But then I realized all I needed

00:22.939 --> 00:26.443
was some time alone to clear my mind.

00:26.443 --> 00:30.830
Now I have returned to you
with a resounding "yes."

00:30.830 --> 00:32.698
Say, Sam,

00:32.698 --> 00:35.668
I don't like it any more than you do,

00:35.668 --> 00:38.038
but I've decided to accept it.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.956
Therefore, I am going to work here

00:39.956 --> 00:41.458
so that when you finally accept it,

00:41.458 --> 00:42.959
as we both know you will,

00:42.959 --> 00:46.463
we can move forward to build
and nurture our relationship.

00:46.463 --> 00:48.348
Excuse me. I have customers to wait on.

00:48.348 --> 00:49.682
No, you...!

00:49.682 --> 00:52.102
Listen, listen, I, I
don't want you here.

00:52.102 --> 00:53.603
I don't want you in the building.

00:53.603 --> 00:55.605
I don't want you on this planet.

00:55.605 --> 00:56.606
He's crazy about me.

00:56.606 --> 00:58.108
No, I'm not crazy about her.

00:58.108 --> 01:00.110
You make me sick to my stomach.

01:00.110 --> 01:01.561
That's how I am about her.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.530
We have kind of a little thing going.

01:05.031 --> 01:07.033
Now, what would you like?

01:07.033 --> 01:09.035
I'm sorry. This isn't my table.

01:10.537 --> 01:11.538
Miss Chambers?

01:13.039 --> 01:14.541
You know I'm your friend

01:14.541 --> 01:16.543
and friends should stick together,

01:16.543 --> 01:19.546
so I'm really happy you're back.

01:19.546 --> 01:21.047
Oh, Woody, thanks.

01:23.049 --> 01:25.802
Well, kind of happy,
'cause Sam's my friend, too.

01:25.802 --> 01:27.637
So I can't be too happy

01:27.637 --> 01:32.142
or else he'll can me, which
will make me really sad.

01:32.142 --> 01:36.146
And I know you, as my friend,
wouldn't be happy about that.

01:36.146 --> 01:40.150
So, whatever you do, don't
tell Sam what I just told you.

01:40.150 --> 01:43.069
What did you just tell me?

01:43.069 --> 01:44.938
Perfect.

01:47.323 --> 01:51.194
(piano plays)

01:51.194 --> 01:53.663
? Making your way in the world today ?

01:53.663 --> 01:56.666
? Takes everything you've got ?

01:56.666 --> 01:59.669
? Taking a break from all your worries ?

01:59.669 --> 02:02.672
? Sure would help a lot ?

02:02.672 --> 02:07.927
? Wouldn't you like to get away? ?

02:07.927 --> 02:10.713
? Sometimes you want to go ?

02:10.713 --> 02:15.718
? Where everybody knows your name ?

02:15.718 --> 02:20.723
? And they're always glad you came ?

02:20.723 --> 02:22.725
? You want to be where you can see ?

02:22.725 --> 02:25.728
? Our troubles are all the same ?

02:25.728 --> 02:30.733
? You want to be where
everybody knows your name ?

02:30.733 --> 02:33.736
? You want to go where people know ?

02:33.736 --> 02:35.738
? People are all the same ?

02:36.239 --> 02:40.743
? You want to go where
everybody knows your name. ?

02:58.645 --> 03:00.897
Sam, what do you think of
Vivaldi at the ceremony?

03:00.897 --> 03:02.899
You can invite anybody
you want. I don't care.

03:02.899 --> 03:03.900
I'm not going to be...

03:03.900 --> 03:05.902
As a matter of fact,
nobody's going to be there

03:05.902 --> 03:07.770
'cause there's not
going to be a wedding,

03:07.770 --> 03:09.689
but if you want to
work here, that's fine.

03:09.689 --> 03:10.573
You got my blessings.

03:10.573 --> 03:13.409
I'm glad you've come around
to see the wisdom of it.

03:13.409 --> 03:14.694
Oh, there's wisdom in it.

03:14.694 --> 03:16.196
There's tons of wisdom.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.197
Let me tell you why.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.199
I want you to have
a front-row seat here

03:19.199 --> 03:20.667
for all the luscious babes

03:20.667 --> 03:23.169
I'm going to have marching
through here every night.

03:23.169 --> 03:24.671
As a matter of fact, from now on,

03:24.671 --> 03:28.041
it's casaba city, and
you're looking at the mayor.

03:28.041 --> 03:31.794
You'll pardon me if I don't
refer to you as "Your Honor."

03:31.794 --> 03:36.132
You know, I'm going down to the
Cape this weekend for a little R&R.

03:36.132 --> 03:38.134
That's Rhonda and room service.

03:38.134 --> 03:40.887
(all hooting)

03:40.887 --> 03:41.688
I love the Cape.

03:41.688 --> 03:44.190
We spent so many happy hours there.

03:44.190 --> 03:45.692
Sightseeing, talking...

03:45.692 --> 03:46.693
Yeah, well, Rhonda and I

03:46.693 --> 03:48.194
aren't going to have
any time for sightseeing.

03:48.194 --> 03:50.196
We're going to be just
coming up for air long enough

03:50.196 --> 03:51.564
to order some of that fish head soup.

03:51.564 --> 03:52.815
Bouillabaisse.

03:52.815 --> 03:54.817
No, I mean it.

03:56.819 --> 03:58.321
Fine.

03:58.321 --> 03:59.322
I couldn't care less.

03:59.322 --> 04:00.823
I'll just continue on,

04:00.823 --> 04:03.326
secure in the knowledge
that you love me.

04:03.326 --> 04:05.328
I did... I did not say I loved you.

04:05.328 --> 04:06.829
You proposed to me.

04:06.829 --> 04:08.331
Love and marriage go together.

04:08.331 --> 04:09.832
Why else would you propose to someone?

04:11.084 --> 04:13.419
Nevertheless do what you will,

04:13.419 --> 04:15.922
but keep in mind that
you might try to sabotage

04:15.922 --> 04:16.923
this tryst of yours

04:16.923 --> 04:19.926
because deep in your heart,
you know it's not right.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.310
We are.

04:21.310 --> 04:23.062
Oh, yeah, I see what you're doing here.

04:23.062 --> 04:25.064
You're trying to plant a
little seed in my brain.

04:25.064 --> 04:26.065
Oh, don't be silly.

04:26.065 --> 04:28.067
I know of nothing that
grows in solid rock.

04:28.067 --> 04:30.069
Yeah.

04:31.070 --> 04:32.939
Hi, everybody.

04:34.407 --> 04:36.909
(dejectedly): Hi, Diane. Welcome back.

04:36.909 --> 04:41.664
Carla, you don't seem
surprised that I'm working here.

04:41.664 --> 04:42.949
I knew you'd return.

04:43.449 --> 04:44.951
Your kind always does.

04:44.951 --> 04:47.954
Like roaches after atomic testing.

04:48.838 --> 04:50.673
Well, I must say I'm relieved

04:50.673 --> 04:52.175
to see you act this way.

04:52.175 --> 04:55.678
I was expecting something
a little more violent.

04:55.678 --> 04:56.679
No.

04:58.181 --> 04:59.599
I'm glad you're back.

04:59.599 --> 05:01.100
You see, I got this theory.

05:01.100 --> 05:04.103
If you and Sam hang around
each other long enough,

05:04.103 --> 05:06.472
one of you is going to kill the other.

05:06.472 --> 05:09.309
Now, if Sam kills you, fine.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.811
If you kill Sam, I'll turn you in,

05:11.811 --> 05:14.697
get a reward, and you'll get the chair.

05:14.697 --> 05:16.899
(imitates electrical crackling)

05:16.899 --> 05:19.068
Either way I come up a winner.

05:19.068 --> 05:20.903
I think we're becoming friends.

05:20.903 --> 05:22.905
Let's have a slumber party sometime.

05:23.906 --> 05:26.909
Hey, there's a kitty-cat in here.

05:26.909 --> 05:28.911
A guy gave 'em to me on
the way in this morning.

05:28.911 --> 05:32.915
You know my kids have been giving me a
lot of crap about not having any pets,

05:32.915 --> 05:35.418
so I figure Max here ought
to shut 'em up for a while.

05:35.418 --> 05:36.919
Well, what do you call

05:36.919 --> 05:37.920
the little one?

05:37.920 --> 05:38.921
What little one?

05:38.921 --> 05:41.424
You know, all that wheat's
making you hallucinate.

05:42.675 --> 05:45.011
Oh, great, she's having babies!

05:45.011 --> 05:46.512
There's another one!

05:46.512 --> 05:48.014
You're a farmboy.

05:48.014 --> 05:51.017
What are you supposed
to do to stop this?

05:52.518 --> 05:55.521
Well, it's too late
to go to the drugstore.

05:59.025 --> 06:03.529
I swear, I swear, this cat
was not pregnant when I got it.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.531
The minute it becomes a Tortelli,

06:05.531 --> 06:07.533
it starts dropping 'em like...

06:08.785 --> 06:09.619
(phone rings)

06:09.619 --> 06:11.120
Oh, yeah, there you are.

06:11.120 --> 06:13.005
Well, I'm off for my weekend, Diane.

06:13.005 --> 06:14.257
Cheers. Oh, by the way, did I tell you

06:14.757 --> 06:15.758
that Rhonda was double-jointed?

06:15.758 --> 06:17.427
Hey, Sam,

06:17.427 --> 06:18.761
it's for you.

06:22.265 --> 06:23.216
Yeah, hello.

06:23.216 --> 06:24.217
Oh, hey, Rhonda.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.719
I was just talking about you.

06:26.719 --> 06:30.723
Oh, oh, no, don't do this to me.

06:30.723 --> 06:32.225
Well...

06:32.725 --> 06:36.612
can't you be born again on Monday?

06:36.612 --> 06:39.148
All right, all right,

06:39.148 --> 06:40.450
Well, you, too.

06:40.450 --> 06:42.452
Whew, do you believe that?

06:42.952 --> 06:44.320
She canceled on me.

06:44.320 --> 06:45.655
Women.

06:45.655 --> 06:48.541
Reminds me of what my
Uncle Henry used to say.

06:48.541 --> 06:49.876
Oh, yeah? What was that, Woody?

06:49.876 --> 06:51.244
Women.

06:56.499 --> 06:59.001
Hey, uh, Sammy, don't let
Diane hear about Rhonda.

06:59.001 --> 07:01.754
She'll load that info into
her shotgun and take aim, huh?

07:01.754 --> 07:05.091
Yeah, no one is going to
ruin Sam Malone's weekend,

07:05.091 --> 07:07.093
no matter what Diane says.

07:07.093 --> 07:09.595
Yeah, hello, Vicki?

07:09.595 --> 07:12.598
Yeah, it's Sam Malone.

07:12.598 --> 07:16.602
Yeah, yeah, listen, uh,
how, how does the idea of,

07:16.602 --> 07:20.606
uh, 48 hours of sun and
surf up at the Cape grab ya?

07:20.606 --> 07:21.607
Oh, yeah?

07:21.607 --> 07:22.608
Well, if that grabs ya,

07:22.608 --> 07:24.610
how's the idea of me
grabbing you grab you?

07:24.610 --> 07:26.112
Yeah, all right.

07:26.112 --> 07:27.113
All right.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.114
Yeah, me, too.

07:28.114 --> 07:31.117
Okay, I, I'll see ya in
about two hours then, Vicki.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.618
All right. Bye-bye.

07:32.618 --> 07:33.619
CLIFF: Yeah.

07:33.619 --> 07:36.122
I thought her name was Rhonda.

07:36.122 --> 07:38.624
Well, uh... Rhonda canceled.

07:38.624 --> 07:39.876
But that's good.

07:39.876 --> 07:41.210
That's good because I like,

07:41.210 --> 07:43.095
I like Vicki better than Rhonda.

07:43.095 --> 07:46.098
As a matter of fact, I kind of
hope that, that Vicki cancels

07:46.098 --> 07:49.602
because I have somebody even
better waiting in the wings.

07:49.602 --> 07:50.853
I know. Me.

07:50.853 --> 07:52.054
No, no, not you.

08:00.780 --> 08:03.282
You know, Vicki, I just want you to know

08:03.282 --> 08:05.785
that this is going to
be the most beautiful,

08:05.785 --> 08:09.288
terrific, special
weekend of my entire life.

08:09.288 --> 08:12.158
Listen, you don't need to keep
selling me on this weekend.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.159
No, I...

08:13.159 --> 08:14.160
I'm sold. All right.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.161
I'm famished.

08:15.161 --> 08:16.412
I wish they'd take our order.

08:16.412 --> 08:17.246
Oh, they'll be here. Don't worry.

08:17.747 --> 08:19.499
Nothing's going to ruin
this weekend, I'll tell ya.

08:19.499 --> 08:22.301
Ah, perfect.

08:22.301 --> 08:23.803
Have you decided?

08:23.803 --> 08:24.720
What'll you have?

08:24.720 --> 08:26.222
Ah, what's the Catch of the Day?

08:26.222 --> 08:27.223
You mean besides me?

08:27.223 --> 08:28.724
(laughing)

08:28.724 --> 08:31.227
Ah, this is great. Isn't this great?

08:31.227 --> 08:32.727
We're having fun, right.

08:32.727 --> 08:33.729
I'll take the scallops.

08:33.729 --> 08:35.731
Yeah, uh, that... two of
those. That'll be good.

08:37.732 --> 08:38.734
Oh, geez!

08:38.734 --> 08:40.236
Are you sure you're okay?

08:40.236 --> 08:41.736
Yeah, are you kidding me?

08:41.736 --> 08:42.738
That was fun for me.

08:42.738 --> 08:44.240
Wasn't it fun for you?

08:44.240 --> 08:46.242
I mean, it's spontaneous, refreshing.

08:46.242 --> 08:47.243
Oh, it's great.

08:47.243 --> 08:48.244
I'll move you to another table.

08:48.244 --> 08:50.112
Don't you dare. This is perfect.

08:50.112 --> 08:52.748
Thank you very much.

08:52.748 --> 08:54.534
You know, someone tried to convince me

08:54.534 --> 08:56.919
that this weekend was going
to be a total disaster.

08:56.919 --> 08:58.621
VICKI: Really? Who?

08:58.621 --> 08:59.422
That person right there!

08:59.422 --> 09:01.924
Sam!

09:09.665 --> 09:12.969
What a surprise.

09:12.969 --> 09:14.337
Hello.

09:14.337 --> 09:15.588
Hello. I'm Vicki.

09:15.588 --> 09:16.589
I'm...

09:16.923 --> 09:18.391
Leaving immediately.

09:18.391 --> 09:19.225
Diane.

09:19.225 --> 09:21.227
Are you enjoying your weekend?

09:21.227 --> 09:23.729
Of course she's enjoying her weekend.

09:23.729 --> 09:25.231
It's a fantastic weekend.

09:25.231 --> 09:26.732
Did you notice your table's all wet?

09:26.732 --> 09:28.734
That's 'cause we want it that way.

09:28.734 --> 09:30.736
As a matter of fact, we ordered it wet.

09:30.736 --> 09:32.738
Hey, you know, I think it's drying out

09:32.738 --> 09:33.739
a little bit, don't you?

09:33.739 --> 09:35.241
Here you go. That's better.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.742
Excuse me, Miss.

09:36.742 --> 09:39.745
There's a telephone
call for you at the desk.

09:39.745 --> 09:41.113
Thank you.

09:41.113 --> 09:42.865
I'll be right back.

09:44.867 --> 09:48.371
I'll miss you.

09:48.371 --> 09:49.872
What the hell are you doing here?

09:49.872 --> 09:53.376
Mm, you know, all your talk
of a lovely weekend at the Cape

09:53.376 --> 09:55.878
made me realize how much I
needed to get away myself.

09:55.878 --> 09:57.380
It's just the most

09:57.380 --> 09:58.881
incredible coincidence

09:58.881 --> 10:00.883
that we ended up at the same place.

10:00.883 --> 10:01.884
I know what you're trying to do.

10:01.884 --> 10:03.886
You're trying to rattle
me, but the joke's on you,

10:03.886 --> 10:04.887
because I'm better under pressure.

10:04.887 --> 10:05.888
I don't rattle.

10:05.888 --> 10:07.890
Only when you shake your head.

10:09.775 --> 10:11.727
Have fun. Okay.

10:13.229 --> 10:14.230
You know, you just guaranteed

10:14.230 --> 10:16.732
this is going to be the
most perfect weekend ever.

10:19.235 --> 10:20.736
Oh, good, yeah, you're back.

10:20.736 --> 10:21.737
Yeah, that's perfect.

10:21.737 --> 10:23.739
Now why don't you sit down over there.

10:23.739 --> 10:25.741
This might be wet here.

10:25.741 --> 10:27.126
Sam? Hmm?

10:27.126 --> 10:28.744
I'm afraid I have to leave.

10:28.744 --> 10:31.914
Oh, God, no, don't say that, please.

10:31.914 --> 10:34.750
I'm sorry. Look, that was
my sister on the phone.

10:34.750 --> 10:35.751
Our grandmother's ill.

10:35.751 --> 10:37.253
I have to fly to Idaho.

10:37.253 --> 10:38.754
Why? You're not a doctor.

10:40.139 --> 10:41.090
Please, please, don't...

10:41.090 --> 10:42.475
Sam, I'm sorry this happened,

10:42.475 --> 10:43.759
but you're going to have

10:43.759 --> 10:45.728
to drive me back.

10:45.728 --> 10:47.229
No, no, uh...

10:47.229 --> 10:49.231
I have to stay here.

10:49.231 --> 10:50.733
Uh, I'll call you a cab.

10:50.733 --> 10:52.735
Well, as long as you
don't go out of your way.

10:52.735 --> 10:54.103
What, again, Vicki?

10:54.103 --> 10:56.605
Even rabbits take a break to eat.

11:00.993 --> 11:03.245
When you're finished there, go upstairs

11:03.245 --> 11:06.248
and help the lady in Mr.
Malone's room with her bags.

11:06.248 --> 11:07.750
WAITER: She's checking out?

11:07.750 --> 11:09.752
Her grandmother's ill.

11:09.752 --> 11:11.253
(Diane laughing)

11:14.623 --> 11:16.125
I'd heard she was dead.

11:16.125 --> 11:18.010
It's nice to know she's just sick.

11:24.633 --> 11:27.186
WOMAN (on TV): Pat,
I'd like to buy a vowel.

11:27.186 --> 11:28.637
A vowel?

11:28.637 --> 11:29.972
There are only two spaces left.

11:29.972 --> 11:31.023
She wants to buy a vowel.

11:31.023 --> 11:33.359
Where do they get these people?

11:33.359 --> 11:35.528
(knocking)

11:39.982 --> 11:40.983
Who is it?

11:40.983 --> 11:42.485
Room service.

11:43.486 --> 11:45.488
Oh, yeah. Yeah, good, thank you.

11:45.488 --> 11:46.989
Put... put it right over there.

11:46.989 --> 11:47.990
Okay.

11:55.498 --> 11:56.499
I bet you're wondering why

11:56.499 --> 11:58.000
I ordered two of everything

11:58.000 --> 11:59.502
when there's only me up here, huh?

11:59.502 --> 12:01.504
Uh, no, not really.

12:03.506 --> 12:06.008
Well, actually, it's 'cause
I want to give the impression

12:06.008 --> 12:07.393
that there are two people in the room.

12:07.393 --> 12:09.845
Well, you fooled me.

12:09.845 --> 12:11.230
Oh.

12:11.230 --> 12:13.015
Good, good, good.

12:14.517 --> 12:15.518
Where are my hot fudge sundaes?

12:15.518 --> 12:17.019
I couldn't fit 'em on the tray.

12:17.019 --> 12:18.020
I'll be right back up.

12:18.020 --> 12:19.522
All right. Great, great.

12:19.522 --> 12:21.524
Uh, make sure you parade around
the lobby a couple of times

12:21.524 --> 12:24.026
before you bring 'em on up. Will ya?

12:24.026 --> 12:25.528
Sure.

12:28.531 --> 12:30.032
(phone rings)

12:40.543 --> 12:41.427
Hello.

12:41.427 --> 12:42.294
Hi, Sam.

12:42.294 --> 12:43.679
How's it going up there?

12:43.679 --> 12:47.049
Uh, fine. Fine.

12:47.049 --> 12:48.050
(giggles)

12:48.050 --> 12:52.555
Oh, don't do that, Vicki. I'm ticklish.

12:52.555 --> 12:56.058
Sam, I feel an apology is in order.

12:56.058 --> 12:58.060
I may have made your friend Vicki

12:58.060 --> 12:59.812
a bit uncomfortable earlier today.

12:59.812 --> 13:01.647
Well, she's plenty
comfortable right now,

13:01.647 --> 13:03.649
so, uh, I'll pass on her message.

13:03.649 --> 13:04.533
Bye-bye, Diane.

13:04.533 --> 13:05.901
No, no, Sam.

13:05.901 --> 13:07.403
I wouldn't feel right

13:07.403 --> 13:09.905
unless I expressed my
feelings personally.

13:09.905 --> 13:11.907
Let me speak with her, please.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.295
Shoot.

13:17.296 --> 13:20.666
She's in the, uh, the
bathroom right now.

13:20.666 --> 13:23.752
She's tickling you from the bathroom?

13:23.752 --> 13:25.554
Well, she just went in there.

13:25.554 --> 13:29.425
She... she always runs into the
bathroom after she tickles me.

13:29.425 --> 13:31.594
Perhaps it's nausea.

13:33.929 --> 13:37.900
Sam, I, I really want to
apologize to her face-to-face.

13:37.900 --> 13:38.901
I'll be right up.

13:38.901 --> 13:40.352
No, no, no, no, don't...
(line disconnects)

14:17.890 --> 14:18.891
Oh, good, good, good.

14:18.891 --> 14:20.893
Do me a favor, will
ya? I'll pay you $50.

14:20.893 --> 14:22.394
I beg your pardon.

14:22.394 --> 14:23.395
Let's go, Harvey.

14:23.395 --> 14:25.397
No, no, no, please.
No funny stuff at all.

14:25.397 --> 14:27.900
Uh, come, come on now.
You'll be saving my life here.

14:27.900 --> 14:28.901
Come, come on in. Come in.

14:28.901 --> 14:29.902
Now hold it now. Just a minute here.

14:29.902 --> 14:31.403
I promise you.

14:31.403 --> 14:32.404
No weird stuff.

14:32.404 --> 14:34.406
I just want your wife
to go in the bathroom

14:34.406 --> 14:35.407
and make some noises.

14:35.407 --> 14:37.293
What kind of noises?

14:37.293 --> 14:39.128
I don't know, uh... woman kind of stuff.

14:39.128 --> 14:40.996
Like you're getting all
dolled up for some hot action.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.884
What does that sound like?

14:44.884 --> 14:45.885
Uh, eh, I don't know.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.386
Whatever you and Harvey do...

14:47.386 --> 14:48.387
Never mind. Never mind.

14:48.387 --> 14:49.388
Just, uh...

14:49.388 --> 14:50.890
Here you go. $50.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.393
(knocking)

14:57.897 --> 14:59.899
Hi, Sam. Hey.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.150
Where's Vicki?

15:01.150 --> 15:02.985
She's, uh, still in the bathroom.

15:03.485 --> 15:06.488
Well, I'll just wait. Huh?

15:07.940 --> 15:09.441
No, uh...

15:09.441 --> 15:11.443
You know, um...

15:11.443 --> 15:12.945
this could take a little while here.

15:12.945 --> 15:13.946
Why don't you, uh,

15:14.446 --> 15:18.334
why don't you just yell your
apologies through the door here?

15:18.334 --> 15:19.201
Oh, that's silly.

15:19.201 --> 15:20.703
I'll be here all weekend.

15:20.703 --> 15:21.704
I can certainly wait.

15:21.704 --> 15:24.873
(woman laughing)

15:27.459 --> 15:29.261
(laughing)

15:29.261 --> 15:31.931
She sure is busy.

15:33.182 --> 15:34.183
Is that enough

15:34.183 --> 15:37.186
or should we snap some towels?

15:44.393 --> 15:46.695
It's the, uh, bathroom inspector.

15:46.695 --> 15:47.696
It's a new thing.

15:49.615 --> 15:50.616
Sam...

15:50.616 --> 15:52.484
let's call an end to
this nonsense right now.

15:52.484 --> 15:54.486
I don't care how rough you were on her;

15:54.486 --> 15:58.490
that is not Vicki.

15:58.490 --> 16:00.492
See, I know Vicki left.

16:00.492 --> 16:03.996
I've known all along.

16:03.996 --> 16:06.999
And you let me go through
this whole stupid act?

16:06.999 --> 16:10.502
Well, I wanted to
see how far you'd go--

16:10.502 --> 16:12.755
ordering two sets of meals,

16:12.755 --> 16:14.556
leaving empty bottles of Vitamin E

16:14.556 --> 16:17.559
outside your door...

16:17.559 --> 16:18.927
Yeah, well, what about you?

16:18.927 --> 16:21.313
You know, coming all the
way up here to spy on me?

16:21.313 --> 16:24.183
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

16:24.183 --> 16:25.351
Yeah?

16:27.903 --> 16:29.822
What's the use?

16:29.822 --> 16:32.191
We both look like imbeciles.

16:32.191 --> 16:34.526
All we do is find new ways

16:34.526 --> 16:38.530
to humiliate each other.

16:38.530 --> 16:41.417
I humiliate you by saying "no"

16:41.417 --> 16:44.370
to your sweet proposal.

16:44.370 --> 16:47.756
You humiliate me by
rejecting my retraction.

16:47.756 --> 16:49.675
You carry off this ridiculous charade.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.593
I spy on you in hotel rooms.

16:51.593 --> 16:54.096
It's become sick and degrading.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.097
And, quite frankly,

16:55.097 --> 16:57.466
I'm embarrassed to be a
part of it, Sam. Yeah, well,

16:57.466 --> 16:59.301
I'm not too thrilled
you're part of it either.

17:01.186 --> 17:03.689
Here you go, pal.

17:03.689 --> 17:04.690
Oh...

17:08.694 --> 17:10.695
Oh, yeah, yeah.

17:10.695 --> 17:13.198
I guess this all looks
pretty weird, doesn't it?

17:13.198 --> 17:15.200
Oh, nothing I haven't seen before.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.707
I believe you owe us $50.

17:21.707 --> 17:24.209
Now there's a new one.

17:28.714 --> 17:30.582
Boy, Carla, you know, I never thought

17:30.582 --> 17:33.585
you'd be able to unload all
those kittens in one night.

17:33.585 --> 17:35.087
Yeah, it was just a simple matter

17:35.087 --> 17:36.588
of marketing technique, you know.

17:36.588 --> 17:38.090
Giving away a beer with each kitten

17:38.090 --> 17:39.475
really did the trick.

17:45.314 --> 17:46.765
Come on.

17:46.765 --> 17:47.766
Here, Toots,

17:47.766 --> 17:51.687
time for your first cab ride.

17:51.687 --> 17:53.689
You know you guys are
really gonna love Vera.

17:53.689 --> 17:56.191
She has legs just
like a scratching post.

18:12.841 --> 18:14.593
Oh, good evening.

18:14.593 --> 18:16.095
Good evening.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.859
Oh, it's you.

18:32.728 --> 18:34.229
Small world.

18:34.229 --> 18:35.614
Mm...

18:35.614 --> 18:38.734
I thought I was eating late
enough to avoid seeing you.

18:38.734 --> 18:40.319
Me, too.

18:40.319 --> 18:42.204
The only reason why I
waited so long to eat.

18:42.204 --> 18:44.656
Oh, I thought perhaps it was because

18:44.656 --> 18:46.158
you've been eating for two.

18:51.296 --> 18:53.715
(sighs)

18:56.418 --> 18:57.920
I'm kind of glad you're here.

18:57.920 --> 18:59.671
I've been sitting here
driving myself crazy.

18:59.671 --> 19:01.223
When we used to come here,

19:01.223 --> 19:04.393
wasn't there a lobster
trap out in the lobby?

19:04.393 --> 19:06.812
Oh, yeah.

19:06.812 --> 19:08.814
Yeah, I guess the
lobsters finally wised up

19:08.814 --> 19:10.682
and starting coming through the kitchen.

19:10.682 --> 19:12.734
(laughs)

19:19.525 --> 19:22.027
By the way, I suppose
I owe you an apology

19:22.027 --> 19:23.529
for being here this weekend.

19:23.529 --> 19:25.948
In retrospect, I guess...

19:25.948 --> 19:28.867
it was probably a mistake.

19:28.867 --> 19:30.669
Probably?

19:32.421 --> 19:34.923
I'd say "definitely"
if you were to admit

19:34.923 --> 19:38.927
that it was a mistake to
flaunt your date in front of me.

19:40.379 --> 19:41.880
Apology accepted.

19:45.434 --> 19:47.936
Boy, you know the one thing
I really hate is to eat alone.

19:47.936 --> 19:49.805
I always feel like
someone's looking at me.

19:49.805 --> 19:51.974
I'm the only one here.

19:51.974 --> 19:53.775
Well, you're looking at me.

19:58.897 --> 20:02.201
Then you can either join me or
I can eat with my eyes closed.

20:02.201 --> 20:05.988
Well, I hate to have
you butter your knuckles.

20:07.239 --> 20:08.740
Good.

20:12.160 --> 20:14.162
Sam, you know what I remember most

20:14.162 --> 20:16.164
about being here before?

20:16.164 --> 20:17.165
Oh, sure, sure.

20:17.165 --> 20:20.669
Yeah, I think the salt
air gives me extra stamina.

20:25.090 --> 20:27.893
Actually, I was thinking
of the Clams Oregano,

20:27.893 --> 20:30.646
but now that you mention
it, I did enjoy the...

20:30.646 --> 20:33.315
salt air.

20:39.905 --> 20:44.076
Sam, what I said before
about our relationship,

20:44.076 --> 20:45.661
I'm...

20:45.661 --> 20:46.945
I'm sorry I said it.

20:46.945 --> 20:49.331
I was upset.

20:49.331 --> 20:52.117
It may not be ideal, but...

20:52.117 --> 20:55.537
it hasn't been without its moments.

20:58.040 --> 20:59.041
Speaking of moments,

20:59.041 --> 21:02.294
this, uh, is beginning
to feel like one here.

21:05.297 --> 21:07.683
Yes, I think I've decided what I want,

21:07.683 --> 21:09.935
and it's not on the menu.

21:09.935 --> 21:12.271
Oh, you want to skip the main course

21:12.271 --> 21:15.140
and jump right into the "Sammy Soufflé"?

21:17.109 --> 21:19.611
I see you haven't lost
your way with words.

21:26.485 --> 21:27.986
Let's go.

21:27.986 --> 21:28.987
Yes, this is the perfect moment.

21:28.987 --> 21:31.490
But... it is with the understanding,

21:31.490 --> 21:34.376
isn't it, of...

21:34.376 --> 21:37.996
what this step we're
about to take means?

21:37.996 --> 21:39.247
Oh, yeah, yeah, no problem.

21:39.247 --> 21:40.749
If they give us any trouble,

21:40.749 --> 21:41.750
I'll just pay for both rooms.

21:47.222 --> 21:49.091
What it means between us.

21:49.091 --> 21:50.425
Oh, now wait, listen. Listen.

21:50.425 --> 21:52.010
No, it has to mean something, Sam.

21:52.010 --> 21:53.845
I'm only gonna agree to do this if,

21:54.346 --> 21:56.231
if we agree that it
doesn't mean anything.

21:57.566 --> 22:00.435
How can our lovemaking
not mean something?

22:00.435 --> 22:02.571
Well, it's easy. Just concentrate.

22:07.442 --> 22:08.443
I don't want to get caught up

22:08.443 --> 22:10.946
in a war of words with you.

22:10.946 --> 22:15.450
What I'm feeling right
now is very... special,

22:15.951 --> 22:17.953
and I think we should go upstairs

22:17.953 --> 22:19.454
and be with each other

22:19.454 --> 22:21.957
and figure out what it means afterwards.

22:21.957 --> 22:23.208
Let's go.

22:23.208 --> 22:25.544
No.

22:25.544 --> 22:27.045
What?

22:27.546 --> 22:30.048
I-I gotta be clear what I'm doing here.

22:30.048 --> 22:32.434
I mean, my gut's telling me one thing,

22:32.434 --> 22:34.936
but my, my head's telling
me something quite different.

22:36.805 --> 22:38.056
I don't believe what I'm hearing.

22:38.056 --> 22:39.558
(chuckling)

22:39.558 --> 22:41.059
Oh...!

22:41.059 --> 22:42.060
Gotcha.

22:42.060 --> 22:43.562
(laughs)

22:43.562 --> 22:45.814
You were joking? (laughs)

22:45.814 --> 22:47.399
Yeah. How's it feel? I
mean, how do you like it

22:47.399 --> 22:49.618
when you get your motor all revved up

22:49.618 --> 22:52.154
and then someone jerks
the rug out from under you?

22:52.154 --> 22:57.459
Well, mixed metaphors
aside, I don't like it a bit.

22:57.459 --> 22:58.960
Yeah.

22:58.960 --> 23:02.964
But your point is well
taken, and I deserved that.

23:02.964 --> 23:04.466
Well, great.

23:04.466 --> 23:05.967
(chuckling)

23:05.967 --> 23:07.469
All right.

23:07.469 --> 23:08.970
Come on. Let's go.

23:08.970 --> 23:10.972
No.

23:12.474 --> 23:13.475
What do you mean "no"?

23:13.475 --> 23:14.976
Oh, all right, I see what you doing.

23:14.976 --> 23:16.478
That's good. That's, that's very funny.

23:16.478 --> 23:17.479
That's... (chuckles)

23:17.479 --> 23:19.231
All right. Come on.

23:19.231 --> 23:23.185
No, the only place I'm going is home.

23:23.185 --> 23:23.985
You know, it's very funny.

23:24.486 --> 23:25.487
I laughed. The joke's over.

23:25.487 --> 23:29.991
Sam, this is the wrong
time for physical dalliance.

23:29.991 --> 23:30.992
It's too soon.

23:30.992 --> 23:33.445
If we rush into a
physical encounter now,

23:33.445 --> 23:35.947
we might ruin the much more important

23:35.947 --> 23:37.833
nuptial consummation coming up.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.337
Smell the old salt air.

23:42.337 --> 23:43.705
Sam, please.

23:43.705 --> 23:44.673
This is nothing to worry about.

23:44.673 --> 23:46.041
We're on the right course.

23:46.041 --> 23:48.960
When we're married,
you'll be happy we waited.

23:48.960 --> 23:50.962
Really, this is nothing
to be upset about.

23:50.962 --> 23:51.847
Bye-bye.

23:51.847 --> 23:53.298
Fine.

23:53.298 --> 23:55.300
Fine, fine, fine, fine.
I mean, it's perfect.

23:55.300 --> 23:57.803
You said someone was
gonna ruin this weekend,

23:57.803 --> 24:00.305
but now I'm really
gonna have some fun here.

24:02.307 --> 24:03.809
Shoot.

24:06.311 --> 24:07.813
Did we lose another one?

24:07.813 --> 24:08.814
(groans)

24:09.305 --> 24:15.631
