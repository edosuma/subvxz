00:00.812 --> 00:04.747
Kevin is a lazy, shitty commissioner.

00:04.867 --> 00:06.494
- Oh, really?
- Why do you ask?

00:06.614 --> 00:09.159
Well let me tell you.
I was stuck in traffic,

00:09.279 --> 00:12.935
and I called Kevin to ask him
for one tiny favor:

00:13.055 --> 00:14.947
to use his power as a commissioner

00:15.067 --> 00:16.586
to *** a player for me.

00:16.706 --> 00:19.219
And he says to me, "Look,
I can't do it for you.

00:19.287 --> 00:21.888
If I do it for you, then I
got to do it for everybody."

00:21.956 --> 00:23.657
You are a bureaucrat!

00:23.724 --> 00:25.859
Like the fat lady at the DMV.

00:25.927 --> 00:30.730
Like the piece of shit at McDonald's who
won't give me a McGriddle at 10:01.

00:30.798 --> 00:33.867
My asshole could be a better
commissioner than you!

00:33.935 --> 00:35.732
And I'm ready to prove it.

00:36.198 --> 00:37.537
Oh, God!

00:37.605 --> 00:39.239
(high-pitched voice):
It's me, Ruxin's asshole.

00:39.307 --> 00:40.240
Oh!

00:40.308 --> 00:42.075
And I should be the
commissioner instead of Kevin.

00:42.143 --> 00:43.076
Oh, my God!

00:43.144 --> 00:43.977
Do you know why?

00:44.045 --> 00:44.578
(Kevin groaning)

00:44.645 --> 00:46.880
I spew less shit and
I smell much better.

00:46.948 --> 00:48.748
Looks like a rusty balloon knot.

00:48.816 --> 00:52.534
The preceding message was paid for
by friends of Ruxin's asshole.

00:52.654 --> 00:57.472
<font color="#EC14BD">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#EC14BD">www.addic7ed.com</font>

00:57.592 --> 01:02.162
So you're saying that I should've left
Ruxin's asshole up on the message board?

01:02.230 --> 01:04.730
PETE: Ruxin's post contained
a lot of wonderful joy and

01:04.799 --> 01:07.267
happiness, and you took it down
before we had a chance to spread

01:07.335 --> 01:09.002
it around to the rest of the world.

01:09.070 --> 01:10.904
First of all, let's start at
the beginning, the facts.

01:10.972 --> 01:13.373
He called me every three minutes
this morning, for an hour, just

01:13.441 --> 01:15.909
constantly begging me to change
his lineup, change his lineup,

01:15.977 --> 01:16.676
change his lineup.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.612
Just because someone is
annoying you with their phone

01:18.679 --> 01:21.548
calls doesn't give you the
right to censor their posts.

01:21.616 --> 01:22.382
Fine.

01:22.450 --> 01:25.018
But there has been a precedent
set that there will be no

01:25.086 --> 01:27.254
personal attacks on the message board.

01:27.321 --> 01:28.121
ANDRE: What are you... No!

01:28.189 --> 01:28.955
What are you talking about?

01:29.023 --> 01:29.923
Yes!

01:30.043 --> 01:34.242
The message boards are founded on
the great principle of personal attacks.

01:34.362 --> 01:37.397
You, by the way, are the great
leader of all the best personal

01:37.465 --> 01:40.367
attacks on our boards, lest
we forget Andre and the whole

01:40.434 --> 01:42.369
"Nosferatu" campaign you ran on him.

01:42.436 --> 01:45.805
Aha, to my defense, I thought
it was a compliment to be

01:45.873 --> 01:46.573
compared to a celebrity.

01:46.641 --> 01:47.274
No, you didn't.

01:47.341 --> 01:47.908
I really did.

01:47.975 --> 01:48.875
No, you didn't.

01:48.943 --> 01:51.878
Okay... You look a lot like Nosferatu...
I do not.

01:51.946 --> 01:53.713
I should never have
lent you that movie.

01:53.781 --> 01:54.381
Really?

01:54.448 --> 01:55.081
TACO: Hey, guys.

01:55.149 --> 01:55.749
What's up?

01:55.816 --> 01:58.552
What happened to the, uh, what
happened to the wrist there?

01:58.619 --> 02:03.016
Oh, well, to make a short story long, I
fell out of a tree, landed on my wrist.

02:03.691 --> 02:05.959
But I made a huge
discovery today, guys.

02:06.027 --> 02:09.729
Like most people, I've always been
into traditional Eastern medicine.

02:09.797 --> 02:12.299
I just always thought that Western
medicine was a bit of a joke.

02:12.366 --> 02:13.133
What?

02:13.200 --> 02:15.335
But when I got to the emergency
room, I was blown away

02:15.403 --> 02:16.469
by how professional it was.

02:16.537 --> 02:19.606
Not a whiff of incense,
everything was clean, no weird

02:19.674 --> 02:21.741
Chinese guy trying to
pinch your nipples.

02:21.809 --> 02:24.611
I mean, guys, this entire
experience has really opened my

02:24.679 --> 02:26.513
eyes to the ancient
wisdom of the West.

02:26.581 --> 02:28.648
Oh, yeah, really old stuff.

02:28.716 --> 02:30.116
Oh, wait a minute.

02:30.184 --> 02:31.985
You're one of these
healers, aren't you?

02:32.053 --> 02:32.852
Doctor.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.588
I have seen you in the
traditional garb.

02:34.655 --> 02:35.322
Scrubs?

02:35.389 --> 02:37.090
Is that why you plucked your mane?

02:37.158 --> 02:40.260
Okay, just... I thought it was impossible
to heal the human body without

02:40.328 --> 02:42.596
patchouli oil, but I stand corrected.

02:42.663 --> 02:43.663
Oh, check this out.

02:43.731 --> 02:46.833
Someone does not like that
you took down his post.

02:46.901 --> 02:50.270
It looks like Ruxin renamed his
team the Kevin's Microdongs.

02:50.338 --> 02:51.671
Oh, what an asshole.

02:51.739 --> 02:53.640
He wants to play, let's play.

02:53.708 --> 02:57.210
I'm just gonna change his team name back...
No, you can't change a team name.

02:57.278 --> 02:58.178
Oh, good luck.

02:58.245 --> 02:59.813
Why won't it let me
change the team name?

02:59.981 --> 03:02.549
I can add/drop, I can change the
entire league's name, but I

03:02.617 --> 03:04.317
can't change a team's... come on.

03:04.385 --> 03:07.020
Our brilliant forefathers in
the ancient fantasy football

03:07.088 --> 03:09.155
leagues put in a system
of checks and balances.

03:09.223 --> 03:10.957
Goddamn, I hate being
commissioner of this league.

03:11.025 --> 03:11.958
You guys are assholes.

03:12.026 --> 03:14.294
Speaking of assholes...
Hi.

03:14.362 --> 03:15.161
Hello.

03:15.229 --> 03:18.665
Or should I say...
(high-pitched voice): Oh, hello!

03:18.733 --> 03:19.633
(chuckling)

03:19.700 --> 03:20.667
Like the video.

03:20.735 --> 03:22.035
Ah!

03:22.103 --> 03:24.304
Psyched for Sunday matchups.

03:24.372 --> 03:26.906
Andre, I think you're gonna have
a lot of trouble against the

03:26.974 --> 03:28.208
Kevin's Microdongs.

03:28.275 --> 03:29.509
It's gonna be a tough match.

03:29.577 --> 03:31.978
Those little Microdongs
are very feisty.

03:32.046 --> 03:35.715
Yeah, the Kevin's Microdongs are
best at coming from behind.

03:35.783 --> 03:37.517
Do me a favor and change
the name back, please.

03:37.585 --> 03:38.251
Okay, fair enough.

03:38.319 --> 03:39.085
Will you change it back??

03:39.153 --> 03:39.919
I will change it back.

03:39.987 --> 03:40.587
Thank you.

03:40.655 --> 03:44.824
To...
the McArthur's Crotchnubs.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.482
- Good one.
- How does that, how does that work?

03:46.602 --> 03:48.967
- Very mature. You wanna do this?
- Thank you.

03:49.087 --> 03:50.718
- Alright, let's do this.
- Great.

03:50.838 --> 03:57.070
I'm going to be the...
Ruxin Looks Like A Middle-Aged Lesbians.

03:57.138 --> 03:57.871
Okay.

03:57.938 --> 03:58.938
That's true, actually.

03:59.006 --> 03:59.873
I'm fine with that.

03:59.940 --> 04:02.175
You know what, just... can we just stop...
Ruxin!

04:02.243 --> 04:04.077
Getting all the grease
all over my computer.

04:04.145 --> 04:07.514
All right, just wash your hands before
you use it, I don't get your germs.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.983
Whoa, whoa, washing
your hands is healthy?

04:10.051 --> 04:11.851
I did it 'cause it felt good.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.606
I have so much to learn.

04:13.726 --> 04:14.784
Really, Taco?

04:17.077 --> 04:18.812
It will kill me if this
game ends in a tie.

04:18.880 --> 04:19.546
I need this win.

04:19.613 --> 04:20.880
This game's pretty much done.

04:20.949 --> 04:23.884
By the way, did I tell you about the
line I have on the Bears tickets?

04:23.952 --> 04:24.685
Really?

04:24.753 --> 04:25.319
Yeah.

04:25.387 --> 04:28.155
Amazing tickets to the Vikings game
pretty much just handed to me.

04:28.223 --> 04:28.756
How?

04:28.823 --> 04:32.259
There's this guy who had these tickets
and he didn't want them and... This guy?

04:32.327 --> 04:33.027
How do you know him?

04:33.094 --> 04:34.228
I met him at the park.

04:34.295 --> 04:36.330
I was jogging and...
just a friendly dude.

04:36.398 --> 04:39.066
And he saw my Bears shirt, and
he's like, "I got these tickets

04:39.134 --> 04:40.768
for next weekend; I can't go.

04:40.835 --> 04:41.602
Do you want them?"

04:41.669 --> 04:43.670
And I was like, "Sure, how
much do you want for them?"

04:43.738 --> 04:45.672
And he's like, "Don't worry about it.

04:45.740 --> 04:47.775
I'm sure you'll do me a
solid at a certain point.

04:47.842 --> 04:48.776
And just take them."

04:48.843 --> 04:52.346
You are gonna get tickets
from a stranger, and all you

04:52.414 --> 04:53.547
have to do is a favor in return?

04:53.615 --> 04:54.782
Oh, don't, don't start.

04:54.849 --> 04:55.916
What are you, in second grade?

04:55.984 --> 04:57.051
No, it's filthy.

04:57.118 --> 04:57.785
Yeah.

04:57.852 --> 05:02.089
Look, it's a normal person doing
a nice favor for someone else.

05:02.157 --> 05:04.625
Is he gonna put the tickets through the
little hole in the bathroom stall?

05:04.692 --> 05:06.293
Are you really doing what
I think you're doing?

05:06.361 --> 05:07.361
Did he sing the song "Faith"?

05:07.429 --> 05:09.029
Did he tap your foot
underneath the stall?

05:09.097 --> 05:10.942
Dude, favors are gay.

05:11.062 --> 05:12.968
Parks are super gay.

05:13.088 --> 05:16.116
Parks are like the club meth
for homosexuals.

05:16.236 --> 05:17.990
But instead of Jamaicans, it's hobos.

05:18.110 --> 05:20.334
- I know some Jamaican hobos.
They're not gay. - Really?

05:21.580 --> 05:23.697
Oh, don't take a knee, Palmer.

05:23.817 --> 05:25.584
- I mean it's done.
- They're running off the clock.

05:25.704 --> 05:27.279
- It's over.
- Great.

05:27.730 --> 05:29.326
So me and Andre have tied this one.

05:29.446 --> 05:31.644
Yes, this is one of our few ties actually.

05:31.764 --> 05:33.698
- It's total bullshit.
- No, it's not.

05:33.818 --> 05:35.177
- Yes it is.
- It's a tie.

05:35.297 --> 05:37.351
If you actually do your job as commissioner

05:37.471 --> 05:39.705
and make a ruling for
what happens at a tie-breaker.

05:39.745 --> 05:41.324
- We need a tie-breaker.
- Oh really? Okay.

05:41.363 --> 05:42.923
You can bring that up before
the next season.

05:43.043 --> 05:44.668
As of right now there is no rule

05:44.708 --> 05:47.127
And a tie is a tie is a tie.
Listen to me.

05:47.247 --> 05:48.914
A tie is like kissing your sister,

05:49.034 --> 05:51.514
which I think everyone
at this table's done, Andre.

05:53.239 --> 05:54.333
I haven't done it,

05:54.453 --> 05:56.641
cause I just looked
at pornographic material at work.

05:56.761 --> 05:59.147
Defect, defect, defect. Back to main's.

05:59.267 --> 06:01.201
We have a tie, we need to fix it.

06:01.321 --> 06:05.393
- We need a tie-breaker. - I agree.
Ties are not acceptable in fantasy football.

06:05.446 --> 06:09.126
Fantasy football is about proving
that you're better than your friends,

06:09.246 --> 06:12.482
not equally good as your friends.
It's not communism.

06:12.602 --> 06:15.906
We're not coveting Billy Joel cassette
tapes or wearing ill fitting blue jeans.

06:16.026 --> 06:18.885
Alright, fine. You want a tie-breaker?
I'll give you a tie-breaker. Here.

06:19.005 --> 06:21.281
Whoever catches this piece
of popcorn in their mouths first,

06:21.401 --> 06:23.485
- wins...
- No. - We're not participating.

06:23.605 --> 06:24.904
- Three, two, one.
- We're not participating.

06:25.024 --> 06:26.187
This doesn't count.

06:26.307 --> 06:28.563
- Do me, do me, do me.
- Okay, here you go, buddy.

06:28.683 --> 06:30.844
- I win.
- Yay!

06:30.912 --> 06:31.979
Suck it.

06:32.046 --> 06:35.482
Andre and I believe that Kevin should
accept our tiebreaker scenario.

06:35.550 --> 06:38.752
And to settle it, I've come
up with a brilliant idea.

06:38.820 --> 06:40.988
Why we should have a scavenger hunt.

06:41.055 --> 06:42.422
And what will we search for?

06:42.490 --> 06:44.658
Kevin's vagina...
(chuckling)

06:44.726 --> 06:47.194
...because Kevin is such a giant
pussy, which is why we are in

06:47.262 --> 06:48.962
this situation in the first place.

06:49.030 --> 06:49.930
You want to play games?

06:49.998 --> 06:50.797
I can play games.

06:50.865 --> 06:53.300
I'm gonna change the
name of our league.

06:53.368 --> 06:58.438
We are now The League, plus one
short douchebag named Ruxin.

06:58.506 --> 06:59.773
Ha!

06:59.841 --> 07:03.110
Ooh, I'm going to change mine,
too, to the "Ruxin Got Serves."

07:03.178 --> 07:04.111
Oh, really?

07:04.179 --> 07:07.614
Well, I'm changing my name to the "Andre
Cried While Watching Jumanjis."

07:07.682 --> 07:09.116
What? I'm sorry.

07:09.184 --> 07:12.186
So Andre and I were hanging
out a few months ago.

07:12.253 --> 07:13.887
We're watching Jumanji.

07:13.955 --> 07:16.623
And Andre starts weeping
at those plucky kids.

07:16.691 --> 07:20.827
"Sometimes I feel like I'm trapped
in a game and I don't know the rules."

07:20.895 --> 07:25.866
What? No. I...
I had allergies.

07:25.934 --> 07:28.635
Oh, Ruxin, you know that's...
that's crossing the line.

07:28.703 --> 07:30.804
Oh, excuse me, I'm
over the line?

07:30.872 --> 07:33.507
This all started when you
pulled my goddamn post.

07:33.575 --> 07:36.376
I'm so sick of your
commissioner bullshit.

07:36.444 --> 07:38.745
I'll show you over the line.

07:40.822 --> 07:41.682
"The Fear Boners."

07:41.749 --> 07:42.583
Whoa.

07:42.650 --> 07:43.417
Fear Boners?

07:43.484 --> 07:44.585
How dare you, Ruxin.

07:44.652 --> 07:45.686
You know what, guys?

07:45.753 --> 07:47.554
I quit being commissioner
of this league.

07:47.622 --> 07:49.690
You guys can deal with all
the problems yourself.

07:49.757 --> 07:51.925
Especially you, Ruxin,
you asshole.

07:51.993 --> 07:53.060
Oh, come on.

07:53.127 --> 07:54.494
That was just getting fun.

07:54.562 --> 07:56.763
So wait, he's done... done?

07:56.831 --> 07:58.198
Like I mean, not coming back?

07:58.266 --> 08:01.535
Our fearless commissioner
Kevin... I think he's out, man.

08:01.603 --> 08:04.871
Oh, wise one, are these your
Western healing potions?

08:04.939 --> 08:07.189
No, Taco, those are spices.

08:07.309 --> 08:09.243
What does "origano" (oregano)
heal?

08:09.310 --> 08:10.577
Uh, it's for headaches.

08:10.645 --> 08:13.347
And what about "correondare"?

08:13.414 --> 08:16.683
It's coriander, and
that's for hepatitis.

08:16.751 --> 08:18.185
Do you mind if I take some?

08:18.253 --> 08:22.356
I've been practicing your arcane healing
arts on my blind neighbor Simon.

08:22.423 --> 08:24.358
All right, so you got to tell
me what did Ruxin mean by this

08:24.425 --> 08:25.292
whole Fear Boner thing.

08:25.360 --> 08:25.926
Uh-uh.

08:25.994 --> 08:26.793
Yeah, he was really mad.

08:26.861 --> 08:27.861
Can't talk about it, guys.

08:27.929 --> 08:28.462
What?

08:28.529 --> 08:29.129
I can't.

08:29.197 --> 08:29.863
What could it be?

08:29.931 --> 08:31.465
This is one of the
unmentionables.

08:31.532 --> 08:36.130
The things that men in society do not talk
about, unless they kill each other.

08:36.250 --> 08:38.744
- Are you telling us?
- Please. Come on, Pete.

08:39.712 --> 08:43.130
So back in college, we were heading
home from the bars one night.

08:43.412 --> 08:46.747
And Ruxin, Kevin and myself
decided to take an alley as a shortcut.

08:46.814 --> 08:50.083
I wish we hadn't,
but that's life.

08:50.151 --> 08:52.819
Can you guys just not mention to my
parents about the law school thing?

08:52.887 --> 08:53.887
I'm not going, all right?

08:53.955 --> 08:56.156
I'm going to do
Teach for America.

08:56.224 --> 08:57.157
I think you should, man.

08:57.225 --> 09:00.160
I would totally come with you,
but I... I got those fish dates,

09:00.228 --> 09:01.461
man, I can't bail on that.

09:01.529 --> 09:02.296
You cannot.

09:02.363 --> 09:04.298
Dude, you know what
I love is nitrous.

09:04.365 --> 09:05.132
Nitrous, yeah.

09:05.199 --> 09:06.166
Yeah.

09:06.234 --> 09:07.434
Yo!

09:07.502 --> 09:08.769
Oh, God, what is this?

09:08.836 --> 09:09.636
Is he coming over here?

09:09.704 --> 09:11.738
Shit, shit.

09:11.806 --> 09:13.407
Where's Fourth Street at?

09:13.474 --> 09:14.274
Excuse me?

09:14.342 --> 09:15.442
Fourth Street.

09:15.510 --> 09:19.646
Um, it's like two blocks around the
corner over there to the left.

09:19.714 --> 09:21.148
Two blocks around that
corner right there?

09:21.215 --> 09:21.782
To the left.

09:21.849 --> 09:22.949
What...?

09:23.017 --> 09:24.084
Dude, what is that?

09:24.152 --> 09:25.085
What?

09:25.153 --> 09:26.353
What is that in your pants?!

09:26.421 --> 09:27.020
What is that?!

09:27.088 --> 09:28.522
Nothing.
There's nothing in my pants.

09:28.589 --> 09:29.356
You know what that is.

09:29.424 --> 09:31.792
I know what it is, but why is it
here and why does he have it?

09:31.859 --> 09:33.660
If you run at him,
he's gonna finish.

09:33.728 --> 09:34.328
You're sick.

09:34.395 --> 09:34.995
No, I'm not.

09:35.063 --> 09:38.732
You two are his boys... get
him some help, all right?

09:38.800 --> 09:39.599
That was amazing.

09:39.667 --> 09:40.467
You were like the Hulk.

09:40.535 --> 09:42.302
You got scared and you
just burst forth.

09:42.370 --> 09:43.303
I didn't get scared.

09:43.371 --> 09:44.071
I wasn't scared.

09:44.138 --> 09:47.274
I'm just... I'm going to see a girl
and I have an anticip-erection.

09:47.342 --> 09:47.808
No.

09:47.875 --> 09:48.575
Yeah, I do.

09:48.643 --> 09:49.276
Fear boner.

09:49.344 --> 09:49.943
A fear boner.

09:50.011 --> 09:50.477
Fear boner.

09:50.545 --> 09:51.345
It's not a fear boner.

09:51.412 --> 09:52.312
You got a fear boner.

09:52.380 --> 09:53.146
(laughing): Fear boner.

09:53.214 --> 09:54.081
Anticip-erection.

09:54.148 --> 09:55.082
No, fear boner.

09:55.149 --> 09:55.982
Go walk it off, buddy.

09:56.050 --> 09:56.750
You'll be fine.

09:56.818 --> 09:57.351
Walk it off.

09:57.418 --> 09:59.920
Can we never talk about
this ever again, please?

09:59.987 --> 10:01.588
Never again. Come on.

10:01.656 --> 10:03.382
There goes the Hulk.

10:03.502 --> 10:05.567
Yeah, ***.

10:05.687 --> 10:07.864
To this day, we do not discuss it.

10:07.932 --> 10:11.200
Kevin was so modified
in one single moment.

10:11.486 --> 10:13.815
He was cowardly, gay,

10:13.935 --> 10:15.784
homophobic and racist.

10:15.904 --> 10:17.337
The perfect quad-fecta.

10:17.679 --> 10:21.095
- The fear boner.
- And that's why we never talked about it.

10:21.215 --> 10:23.230
Look, the only reason
I told you this story

10:23.350 --> 10:25.302
is cause we have a serious issue
we have to deal with.

10:25.422 --> 10:27.211
We have no commissioner.

10:27.331 --> 10:30.014
And when this league was set up,
we never appointed a vice commissioner.

10:30.134 --> 10:31.126
- I don't wanna do it.
- I don't wanna do it.

10:31.246 --> 10:32.978
- I can do it.
- You see, we have no options.

10:33.001 --> 10:33.895
- None.
- Ruxin can't.

10:33.925 --> 10:34.852
No way.

10:35.205 --> 10:37.189
So I don't know, our only option is

10:37.309 --> 10:38.445
we gotta get Kevin back.

10:38.565 --> 10:40.432
Can we do it with your healing spices?

10:41.362 --> 10:43.889
Yes, give me some paprika. Quick.

10:49.189 --> 10:50.735
Really? A foot race?

10:50.855 --> 10:53.163
You couldn't come up with anything
better to break a tie, huh?

10:53.445 --> 10:55.704
Yeah, just keeping it old-school.

10:56.169 --> 10:58.795
Plus, we didn't trust each other
with any other kind of competition.

10:58.915 --> 11:00.259
I mean don't get me wrong,
I'm not complaining.

11:00.379 --> 11:02.960
 I enjoy both of your unorthodox
running styles.

11:03.080 --> 11:06.553
You, with the shrinking girl thing,
and you with the escaping mental patient.

11:06.621 --> 11:08.255
You should see me sprint.

11:08.322 --> 11:12.859
You know, I don't mean to get in your
head, but, uh, I trained for a marathon.

11:12.927 --> 11:13.660
A what?

11:13.728 --> 11:14.361
A marathon.

11:14.429 --> 11:15.162
What?

11:15.229 --> 11:17.230
A mara...
Hey!

11:17.298 --> 11:18.398
Hey, look who it is.

11:18.466 --> 11:19.866
Our fearless commissioner returns.

11:19.934 --> 11:21.935
No, I am not a commissioner anymore.

11:22.003 --> 11:25.672
I am just a civilian and an avid
fan of public moron racing.

11:25.740 --> 11:28.742
I hope the both of you tear an
ACL, and I hope maybe you die.

11:28.810 --> 11:30.177
Or drop dead a winner.

11:30.244 --> 11:30.944
Good, good for you.

11:31.012 --> 11:33.513
Yeah, and then I'll win because
he's dead, so... High five.

11:33.581 --> 11:35.182
Can we get this going here, guys?

11:35.249 --> 11:35.949
Let's go, guys.

11:36.017 --> 11:36.616
All right.

11:36.684 --> 11:37.217
All right.

11:37.285 --> 11:41.688
Starting line is right here, and the
finish line is 400 miles that way.

11:41.756 --> 11:43.023
Meters, Taco, meters.

11:43.091 --> 11:44.691
400 meters around this loop.

11:44.759 --> 11:47.055
All right, here we go.

11:47.175 --> 11:50.197
On your marks, get...
Whoa! Geez!

11:50.264 --> 11:51.698
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Put the gun down.

11:51.766 --> 11:54.272
Okay, okay...
Is that a real gun?

11:54.392 --> 11:56.935
Of course it's a real gun.
It's a real race.

11:57.055 --> 12:00.362
- Dude, put the gun away, Taco. Put it away.
- Fine, fine.

12:00.482 --> 12:02.042
This race is no longer official.

12:02.110 --> 12:06.446
All right, on your marks, get set...
go!

12:06.514 --> 12:08.448
There they go.

12:08.516 --> 12:11.918
This... this is what we've been
reduced to without our commissioner.

12:11.986 --> 12:12.919
You have to come back.

12:12.987 --> 12:13.754
No, no way.

12:13.821 --> 12:15.822
If they're not going to
follow my rules, I'm out.

12:15.890 --> 12:17.924
We're like a frittata of
Lord of the Flies, man.

12:17.992 --> 12:18.625
Help us.

12:18.693 --> 12:20.660
(oinking)

12:27.844 --> 12:31.104
Come on, guys, run, run, run, run.

12:31.172 --> 12:33.406
Come on, you can do it.

12:33.474 --> 12:34.241
Boo.

12:34.308 --> 12:36.743
Run, run, run.

12:36.811 --> 12:39.479
Andre wins.

12:39.547 --> 12:42.082
No fair. Interference.

12:42.202 --> 12:45.265
I did it! I won! I won!

12:45.385 --> 12:47.845
- No way. You pushed me, okay?
- What?

12:47.965 --> 12:50.190
That was unnecessary roughness, or
at the very least, interference.

12:50.258 --> 12:51.691
That was incidental contact.

12:51.759 --> 12:52.807
Interference.

12:52.927 --> 12:54.427
Incidental contact.

12:54.495 --> 12:55.162
Commissioner?

12:55.229 --> 12:57.764
Oh, no, no, I'm not the commissioner,
and I have no jurisdiction here.

12:57.832 --> 12:59.432
Guys, guys, guys, look,
look, look, look.

12:59.500 --> 13:00.867
See this commitment
ceremony over here?

13:00.935 --> 13:02.602
Yeah, just a couple gay
guys getting married.

13:02.670 --> 13:06.606
Right, but also a well-placed
camera which certainly has two

13:06.674 --> 13:10.210
runners in the background and
what transpired in the race.

13:10.278 --> 13:14.548
If we can watch that video, we can
clearly see that that was interference.

13:14.615 --> 13:17.590
- Interference! - It's a little contact!
- Guys, shut up.

13:18.113 --> 13:20.230
It's on the tape. let's go to the tape.

13:20.710 --> 13:23.957
- Guys, this isn't a good idea.
- I'll create a distraction.

13:24.025 --> 13:25.892
Shh.

13:25.960 --> 13:28.228
Baby bird is out of the nest.

13:28.296 --> 13:31.498
Go, go, go, go.

13:31.566 --> 13:33.333
Oh, Ed, oh, my God.

13:33.401 --> 13:34.367
Pete. How you doing, man?

13:34.435 --> 13:35.135
Good to see you.

13:35.203 --> 13:36.803
Hare you?
What are you doing here?

13:36.904 --> 13:38.338
A couple of my friends
are getting married.

13:38.406 --> 13:40.707
You know what, I forgot to call
you about those Bear tickets.

13:40.775 --> 13:41.541
You still want 'em?

13:41.609 --> 13:43.476
Um, yeah, that would be amazing.

13:43.544 --> 13:44.311
All right, yeah.

13:44.378 --> 13:47.214
You know what, why don't you
come on by tonight to my place,

13:47.281 --> 13:49.015
and I'll give you the tickets.

13:49.083 --> 13:50.884
We could go to, like, your
office, or I could meet you at a

13:50.952 --> 13:53.420
bar or something if you...
No, come on by and have a couple beers.

13:53.487 --> 13:54.254
It'll be fun, huh?

13:54.322 --> 13:56.690
Um... uh, yeah, sure.

13:56.757 --> 13:58.558
Of course, yeah.
Hey, good to see you, man.

13:58.626 --> 13:59.392
Good to see you.

13:59.460 --> 14:00.227
You, too, man.

14:00.294 --> 14:01.061
Looking good.

14:01.128 --> 14:03.234
That guy in the park... was
he the Bear ticket guy?

14:03.354 --> 14:05.098
Yeah, yeah, I'm going to his
house to grab them tonight.

14:05.218 --> 14:07.439
So you still think he's
just doing you a favor?

14:07.559 --> 14:08.371
Yes.

14:08.491 --> 14:11.593
Why is that so rare... that a guy
would just be a nice, normal guy

14:11.713 --> 14:12.638
giving me some tickets?

14:12.709 --> 14:14.935
Yes, what is abnormal about
the well-dressed guy at a gay

14:15.055 --> 14:18.507
commitment ceremony doing you a favor
and inviting you over to his house?

14:18.544 --> 14:21.209
I don't really think you guys
are in any position to decide

14:21.329 --> 14:23.792
who's gay or who's not gay, Mr.

14:23.912 --> 14:27.052
I Taped My Asshole And Showed It
To All Of My Friends While I Was

14:27.172 --> 14:28.073
Giggling Like A Schoolgirl?

14:28.193 --> 14:30.890
I found it to be a very effective
form of communication.

14:31.010 --> 14:32.691
Look, do whatever you need to do.

14:32.811 --> 14:35.556
I'll be so psyched if
you get those tickets.

14:35.676 --> 14:37.920
All I ask is that you
prepare yourself.

14:38.040 --> 14:40.983
You can probably negotiate
down to just a hand job.

14:41.103 --> 14:42.983
Thank you, Mr. Attorney.
I appreciate it.

14:43.103 --> 14:45.716
Oh, uh, if you're going to give him
a hand job, make sure to wear rubber gloves.

14:45.750 --> 14:47.551
That's what all the Japanese girls do.

14:47.618 --> 14:48.719
Great.

14:48.786 --> 14:51.154
Listen, you should look for
some telltale signs: if there's

14:51.222 --> 14:53.957
jazz music on, if there's a fire
going in the fireplace and if

14:54.025 --> 14:55.525
he's wearing a silk robe.

14:55.593 --> 14:57.160
I like jazz.

14:57.228 --> 14:58.495
Oh, I got it!

14:58.563 --> 14:59.496
I got it.

14:59.564 --> 15:00.530
All right, let's do this.

15:00.598 --> 15:01.465
Let's go, let's go.

15:01.532 --> 15:02.332
This is futile, guys.

15:02.400 --> 15:03.300
This is pointless.

15:03.368 --> 15:04.401
Fast forward, fast forward.

15:04.469 --> 15:05.635
Gay stuff, gay stuff.

15:05.703 --> 15:07.137
That's... look at that.

15:07.205 --> 15:08.405
Fast forward.

15:08.473 --> 15:09.639
Look at that.

15:09.707 --> 15:10.707
Happiest day of their lives.

15:10.775 --> 15:11.808
Whoa, whoa!

15:11.876 --> 15:12.876
Look at that.

15:12.944 --> 15:13.910
Okay, look.

15:13.978 --> 15:14.845
Can you zoom in?

15:14.912 --> 15:15.645
Yeah.

15:15.713 --> 15:16.780
Looks like a Levitra ad.

15:16.848 --> 15:18.115
There, I won!

15:18.182 --> 15:19.182
No, no, he knocks me.

15:19.250 --> 15:20.117
No, I won.

15:20.184 --> 15:21.051
He tripped himself.

15:21.119 --> 15:23.353
Look, Ruxin's foot hits his
other foot and he falls.

15:23.421 --> 15:25.956
Look at his wild arms, like a maniac.

15:26.023 --> 15:28.625
If I cared, I would say that
it was incidental contact.

15:28.693 --> 15:29.693
Incidental contact.

15:29.761 --> 15:30.961
That is incidental contact.

15:31.028 --> 15:32.195
I'm making a ruling here.

15:32.263 --> 15:33.130
Andre wins.

15:33.197 --> 15:35.665
Oh, yeah, I'm the winner.

15:35.785 --> 15:39.096
You know what? I accept it. It's better
than a goddamn tie.

15:39.136 --> 15:40.649
Congratulations, Nosferatu.

15:40.769 --> 15:43.947
All right, well...
you don't have to say that.

15:44.067 --> 15:46.038
So, full disclosure...
I tripped myself.

15:46.158 --> 15:47.792
You won that race fair and square.

15:47.860 --> 15:48.627
True that.

15:48.694 --> 15:49.461
Ugh.

15:49.528 --> 15:51.463
Makes me hate you when you
say things like that.

15:51.530 --> 15:52.430
(man chuckling)

15:52.498 --> 15:53.365
There you are.

15:53.432 --> 15:54.766
There you are!

15:54.834 --> 15:56.701
We have been looking
everywhere for the two of you.

15:56.769 --> 15:57.736
Sorry, we don't know you.

15:57.803 --> 16:00.038
No, no, you don't, but we know you.

16:00.106 --> 16:04.042
I'm Ryan, this is Nicholas, and
we just got married today.

16:04.110 --> 16:05.477
Congratulations.

16:05.544 --> 16:06.645
Thank you.

16:06.712 --> 16:07.612
Thank you.

16:07.680 --> 16:12.050
And we videotaped it to commemorate the
ceremony, and someone stole our tape.

16:12.118 --> 16:16.554
Oh, that is awful and...
Shameful.

16:16.622 --> 16:17.789
It is, it is.

16:17.857 --> 16:19.891
Fortunately, though,
we had two cameras.

16:19.959 --> 16:21.126
Oh.

16:21.193 --> 16:22.227
Yeah.

16:22.294 --> 16:25.764
We watched the other tape,
and guess who we saw.

16:25.831 --> 16:27.265
They went to the tape.

16:27.333 --> 16:29.167
We went to the tape.

16:29.235 --> 16:30.502
Come here.

16:30.569 --> 16:31.469
Run!

16:31.537 --> 16:34.005
Run!

16:34.073 --> 16:35.440
Hey, Ed.

16:35.508 --> 16:36.341
Hey, hey, hey.

16:36.409 --> 16:37.175
How you doing?

16:37.243 --> 16:39.039
- Good to see you. Come on in.
- Oh, hey, all right.

16:39.159 --> 16:40.044
- Good to see you, man.
- You find it all right?

16:40.073 --> 16:42.381
Yeah, I did. I found it, um...

16:43.316 --> 16:45.603
- kind of great.
- Good.

16:45.851 --> 16:46.785
Looking good, pal.

16:46.852 --> 16:47.796
Looking good.
Come on in.

16:47.916 --> 16:50.269
You know, I know we talked about
beer, but then I remembered I

16:50.389 --> 16:52.924
had this fantastic French
Cab just sitting around.

16:52.992 --> 16:54.092
I though "You know what?

16:54.160 --> 16:57.034
If it's good enough for me,
it's good enough for Pete."

16:57.154 --> 16:59.264
- To the Bears.
- To the Bears!

16:59.331 --> 17:00.632
Mmm.

17:00.700 --> 17:02.767
Come on, let's grab a
little couch time.

17:02.887 --> 17:04.202
Uh, yeah.

17:04.270 --> 17:06.371
Um... shit.

17:06.439 --> 17:07.505
Okay, Ed.

17:07.573 --> 17:08.673
Yeah?

17:08.741 --> 17:10.608
Um, so here's the deal.

17:10.675 --> 17:11.643
This is all great.

17:11.711 --> 17:13.845
I, um... I just... I can't.

17:13.913 --> 17:14.813
Okay?

17:14.880 --> 17:15.980
I want to be able to do this.

17:16.048 --> 17:17.281
I just don't think I can do it.

17:17.348 --> 17:19.119
I thought maybe it could
just be a hand job.

17:19.240 --> 17:19.911
What?

17:20.031 --> 17:21.096
And then I was like, oh, for the
hand job, I don't... I don't

17:21.215 --> 17:23.002
think I can do that,
even with a glove.

17:23.122 --> 17:23.991
A glove?

17:24.111 --> 17:27.549
Feels like I...
Honey, could you take Tim upstairs, please?

17:28.655 --> 17:29.728
What are you talking about?

17:29.795 --> 17:30.829
Who are those people?

17:30.896 --> 17:31.996
That is my wife and my son.

17:32.064 --> 17:33.798
What are you talking about, hand jobs?

17:33.866 --> 17:37.001
Wait, so you're not...
you're not gay.

17:37.069 --> 17:38.845
- No.
- No, you're not gay, okay.

17:39.616 --> 17:42.341
- That's funny.
- Oh my God. You got an erection.

17:42.461 --> 17:44.967
Oh, sorry, fear boner.

17:45.087 --> 17:47.669
That's fear based. That is a fear boner.

17:47.727 --> 17:49.245
I don't care what you call it.

17:49.303 --> 17:51.186
Just, you know,
just get the hell out of here.

17:51.454 --> 17:52.216
Come on, get out.

17:52.336 --> 17:54.193
Fair enough, I'm just...
I'm gonna get out of here.

17:54.313 --> 17:56.635
I'm just going to go ahead and
grab those tickets real quick.

17:56.755 --> 17:58.056
Oh, no, you're not!
You're not getting those tickets.

17:58.176 --> 17:59.623
I'm just going to...
I'm going to head for that door.

17:59.743 --> 18:00.936
You'll never see me again.

18:01.172 --> 18:01.948
Hey!

18:02.068 --> 18:03.544
You give me those tickets!

18:03.664 --> 18:05.005
(grunting)

18:06.939 --> 18:07.674
I'm not gay!

18:07.741 --> 18:08.641
I'm not gay!

18:08.709 --> 18:09.642
I'm not gay!

18:09.710 --> 18:10.643
Get your dick out of my face!

18:10.711 --> 18:11.744
Get out of this house!

18:11.812 --> 18:12.745
Get out!

18:12.813 --> 18:13.746
(door slamming)

18:13.814 --> 18:15.715
(panting)

18:15.783 --> 18:16.916
Shh.

18:16.984 --> 18:17.884
They still after us?

18:17.952 --> 18:18.852
I don't know.

18:18.919 --> 18:20.153
I heard something.

18:20.221 --> 18:24.324
(grunting and panting)

18:24.391 --> 18:25.692
Shh, shh, shh.

18:25.759 --> 18:26.693
You hear that?

18:26.760 --> 18:27.694
You hear that?

18:27.761 --> 18:28.695
Stop it.

18:28.762 --> 18:29.829
Shh.

18:29.897 --> 18:30.763
Shut up.

18:30.831 --> 18:31.664
Be quiet.

18:31.732 --> 18:33.700
Shut up, okay?

18:35.148 --> 18:37.449
What the heck are
y'all doing in there?

18:37.569 --> 18:38.605
- Hey.
- Nothing.

18:38.934 --> 18:40.106
What are you doing?

18:40.226 --> 18:41.736
The park is closed after dark.

18:41.772 --> 18:44.558
Y'all is trespassing and, from
the looks of it, fornicating.

18:44.678 --> 18:45.883
No, we're not gay.

18:46.003 --> 18:47.196
We're on the run from gays.

18:47.316 --> 18:50.543
Well, I'm gay, and gays like you
give the rest of us a bad name.

18:50.663 --> 18:52.258
- You're gay?
- I'm gay.

18:52.378 --> 18:55.071
- But you're a cop.
- Yeah, but he's got a mustache.

18:55.191 --> 18:57.238
Y'all both under arrest.
Get out of the damn bush.

18:57.358 --> 18:58.348
No!

19:00.440 --> 19:01.366
Hey, Thelma and Louise.

19:01.434 --> 19:03.235
Heard you guys were making some
friends in the park tonight.

19:03.303 --> 19:06.238
I obviously couldn't call Sofia, so thank
you very much for coming down here.

19:06.306 --> 19:07.239
No problem.

19:07.307 --> 19:09.675
Uh, when you guys were running,
which one of you ran faster?

19:09.742 --> 19:10.609
What?

19:10.677 --> 19:12.711
When you were fleeing, which
one of you fled faster?

19:12.779 --> 19:13.712
We were fleeing.

19:13.780 --> 19:14.713
It wasn't a race.

19:14.781 --> 19:17.716
Oh, see, but the problem I'm having
is, I can only bail one of you out.

19:17.784 --> 19:18.717
Why?

19:18.785 --> 19:20.719
Well, I mean, there can only be
one winner, as you taught me.

19:20.787 --> 19:21.553
No.

19:21.621 --> 19:24.623
I couldn't think of a scenario where
I could bail both of you out.

19:24.691 --> 19:26.345
Could you?

19:29.247 --> 19:32.364
It was a...
A tie.

19:32.432 --> 19:33.465
It was a tie.

19:33.533 --> 19:34.333
I'm sorry, what?

19:34.385 --> 19:36.425
- We... tied.
- We tied.

19:36.545 --> 19:40.011
Oh geez Louise, can you guys accept that?

19:40.131 --> 19:42.076
- Yes.
- Alright, great.

19:42.196 --> 19:44.352
- Your commissioner will bail you out.
- You're commissioner again?

19:44.472 --> 19:45.566
Was I ever not?
