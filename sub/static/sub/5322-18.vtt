WEBVTT

00:01.194 --> 00:02.527
Good morning.

00:02.567 --> 00:03.767
Good mor...

00:04.735 --> 00:06.369
- Mmm.
- Ooh!

00:06.403 --> 00:07.970
Yeah, it's good, right?

00:07.971 --> 00:09.981
It's artisanal almond butter.

00:10.607 --> 00:14.158
Well, "A", I'm really impressed that
you know how to use the word "artisanal."

00:14.946 --> 00:19.882
And "B", umm, almond butter? It's
$15 a jar! We can't afford it!

00:20.003 --> 00:21.367
Not with this.

00:21.491 --> 00:25.668
Oh, okay, so you bought a $600 Vitamix
to make $15 worth of almond butter?

00:25.669 --> 00:27.070
- Yup. I'm starting
- Mm-hm.

00:27.071 --> 00:29.434
this new thing where I make
different types of nut butters,

00:29.435 --> 00:32.134
and I sell them at farmers
markets all over the bay area.

00:32.503 --> 00:33.703
Are ya?

00:35.306 --> 00:36.639
Yes, I are.

00:36.673 --> 00:38.553
Aww, you're nuts.

00:39.278 --> 00:41.286
Hey, that could be my catchphrase.

00:41.520 --> 00:45.557
Gabi, do you have any
idea how much it would cost

00:45.558 --> 00:49.135
to buy the nuts, the jars, the
ribbons, the tag, the insurance,

00:49.136 --> 00:50.904
let alone the permits for selling?

00:50.905 --> 00:52.742
Oh, I have an idea!

00:53.076 --> 00:54.610
Let's invent the computer.

00:54.611 --> 00:57.947
Oh, no, no, no! It's important
that innovation be crushed!

00:59.912 --> 01:02.480
Gabi, I'm not trying to crush your dreams.

01:02.481 --> 01:05.705
It's just that money is, you
know... we don't have any.

01:05.751 --> 01:09.051
So, this, ah, idea is
just totally unrealistic.

01:09.052 --> 01:11.221
(Mocking) "This idea
is totally unrealistic."

01:12.228 --> 01:13.428
I'll tell you what.

01:13.429 --> 01:15.841
- I'll be fine with you buying this...
- Yes.

01:16.833 --> 01:19.782
...if you answer "none"
to the following question.

01:19.845 --> 01:22.613
How much of our rent,
which is due in 11 days,

01:22.614 --> 01:25.515
have you spent on this $600 blender?

01:28.829 --> 01:30.029
Dream crusher.

01:32.738 --> 01:34.371

01:55.973 --> 01:57.390
Morning, girl.

01:57.908 --> 01:59.875
What's the matter?

02:01.645 --> 02:05.664
Sofia wants me to return this
Vitamix, but I really want it.

02:07.045 --> 02:10.931
Yeah, well, I want to be the
meat in a Denzel-Lebron sandwich,

02:11.621 --> 02:13.588
but we don't always get what we want.

02:13.616 --> 02:15.600
And sometimes, we get arrested trying.

02:17.292 --> 02:19.260
Check out the outfit I
got for gay pride weekend.

02:20.721 --> 02:22.196
You trying to scare them straight?

02:23.839 --> 02:25.399
Look what I'm wearing.

02:26.869 --> 02:29.137
Why is that parade float wearing your wig?

02:30.706 --> 02:32.187
That's me!

02:32.307 --> 02:33.807
Why are you going to pride?

02:34.200 --> 02:37.307
Oh, remember when you tricked me
into being a drag queen bingo host?

02:37.308 --> 02:38.515
Ha, that was funny.

02:39.180 --> 02:41.614
Well, now, I am a gay icon.

02:41.649 --> 02:44.250
I got men buying me drinks all over town.

02:44.285 --> 02:45.886
Because they think you're a man.

02:45.920 --> 02:48.454
(In deep voice) Well,
if the size 12 shoe fits.

02:50.323 --> 02:51.757
Hey, here's a thought.

02:51.792 --> 02:54.293
Since Allan's out of town,
why don't we go together?

02:54.881 --> 02:57.629
I want to celebrate pride. Not shame.

02:58.799 --> 03:01.067
No. Yolanda, think about it.

03:01.101 --> 03:02.534
I'm an amazing publicist.

03:02.569 --> 03:06.338
I can get us invites to the pre-party,
the parade party, and the post-party.

03:06.372 --> 03:08.406
You can get us free drinks.

03:08.440 --> 03:11.309
We'll be the most popular pair
of people at the pride parade.

03:11.343 --> 03:13.111
Ooh, I like it.

03:13.145 --> 03:15.947
And my apartment sits in
the center of all the action,

03:15.981 --> 03:18.254
so we can change outfits for every event!

03:18.255 --> 03:20.965
Perfect! I own this in many patterns.

03:21.187 --> 03:24.287
Oh, you know, thank God I
didn't rent my place out.

03:24.322 --> 03:26.957
You know, someone offered
me $600 for the weekend?

03:26.991 --> 03:29.426
Somebody offered you $600
to rent out your place?

03:29.460 --> 03:32.901
That's right. My apartment
has a view of the whole parade.

03:32.911 --> 03:36.019
And people are willing to pay
cash dollar money for that.

03:37.300 --> 03:40.526
So, that means my apartment
has a cash dollar money view.

03:40.527 --> 03:43.110
(Gasps) (Whispering) Are you hearing this?

03:45.636 --> 03:48.097
Oh... my God!

03:48.408 --> 03:49.608
Guys...

03:49.758 --> 03:51.770
I just got invited to an Ed Talk.

03:52.236 --> 03:54.183
Congratulations! This is huge!

03:54.184 --> 03:55.866
Wow, that's amazing!

03:56.282 --> 03:58.249
If I knew what it was, I'd be more sincere.

03:58.777 --> 04:01.815
Gabi, an Ed talk is when they invite
this extremely successful person

04:01.816 --> 04:03.762
to give this inspirational
speech, and they live-stream it.

04:03.763 --> 04:05.630
If it goes viral, this
could be a game changer.

04:05.898 --> 04:07.098
Fun!

04:07.650 --> 04:10.504
Every great Ed Talk has this
moment that is so mind-blowing,

04:10.505 --> 04:12.139
the entire audience gasps.

04:12.140 --> 04:14.592
I don't only have that, but
I have a killer opening joke.

04:14.593 --> 04:15.793
Check it.

04:18.363 --> 04:21.298
Why was the computer stressed
out when it got home from work?

04:23.368 --> 04:24.768
'Cause it had a hard drive.

04:26.094 --> 04:28.801
(Laughing)

04:32.376 --> 04:34.725
Roger, you'll be speaking
first, and then Josh will follow.

04:34.726 --> 04:36.277
Do you guys want the podium up or down?

04:36.278 --> 04:37.478
I'll go up.

04:37.479 --> 04:39.280
(Stuttering)

04:39.281 --> 04:40.481
Not me.

04:41.548 --> 04:43.282
See, Steve Jobs had it down.

04:43.517 --> 04:45.121
Dalai Lama had it down.

04:45.122 --> 04:47.222
And Josh Kaminski? He's gonna have it down.

04:49.083 --> 04:50.783
I want nothing between me and my audience.

04:52.486 --> 04:53.854
Oh, brother.

04:55.148 --> 04:56.715
You know what, guys?

04:56.716 --> 04:58.161
I got a little treat for ya.

04:58.646 --> 05:01.113
I want you to come close. I'm
going to share my opening joke.

05:04.454 --> 05:09.118
Why was the computer
stressed out when it got home?

05:11.132 --> 05:12.833
'Cause it had a hard drive. Bam!

05:17.115 --> 05:19.449
Well, this thing's obviously broken.

05:27.660 --> 05:28.860
Hi.

05:29.465 --> 05:32.501
Gabi, it's been three days.
Why is the blender still here?

05:32.781 --> 05:34.842
Well, remember when you said

05:34.843 --> 05:37.011
that if I could figure out
a way to pay for the blender

05:37.012 --> 05:39.447
without using our rent
money, I could keep it?

05:39.540 --> 05:41.475
- Yeah.
- Well, I did it!

05:41.922 --> 05:43.141
You did what?

05:43.142 --> 05:45.884
Well, Josh is away for the
weekend doing some sort of talk.

05:45.885 --> 05:47.875
And he asked me to house sit.

05:47.876 --> 05:49.777
- Okay.
- Meanwhile,

05:49.778 --> 05:51.577
over here at our place,

05:51.766 --> 05:55.302
it's gay pride, and if you
have a view of the parade,

05:55.303 --> 05:58.116
you can rent out your place for $600.

05:58.117 --> 05:59.406
And guess what we have?

05:59.407 --> 06:01.244
A view of the parade!

06:01.436 --> 06:03.804
Problem solved, the fancy blender stays.

06:03.805 --> 06:05.102
Gabi for the win.

06:06.466 --> 06:08.042
Gabi, first, let me say

06:08.043 --> 06:10.096
that I appreciate that
you actually came up with

06:10.097 --> 06:12.039
- a sensible plan.
- I know. I know.

06:12.368 --> 06:14.169
But there's just one problem.

06:14.203 --> 06:17.108
I don't want strangers staying in my place,

06:17.109 --> 06:21.874
touching my things, sleeping in my
bed with their drool and their parts.

06:23.761 --> 06:25.061
But Sofia...

06:25.062 --> 06:27.530
No, Gabi, the answer is
no. Nobody can stay here.

06:27.531 --> 06:30.167
- (Knocking)
- (Coughs)

06:32.070 --> 06:34.038
We may have a little bit of a situation.

06:37.461 --> 06:39.434
You rented out our apartment?

06:39.663 --> 06:41.629
To really cool people.

06:41.664 --> 06:42.864
Probably.

06:43.555 --> 06:44.755
(Knocking)

06:47.514 --> 06:48.914
Hi. Listen, I'm really sorry...

06:48.949 --> 06:50.315
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:50.350 --> 06:52.130
- And they're in.
- Hi.

06:52.585 --> 06:54.051
- I'm Sam.
- And I'm Gracie.

06:54.052 --> 06:55.422
This place is so cute.

06:55.423 --> 06:56.789
Just like all the pictures.

06:56.790 --> 06:58.842
Well, this is hardly a veranda.

06:58.843 --> 07:00.811
Luckily, you guys have
a view of the parade.

07:00.812 --> 07:02.580
Her brother's the grand marshall.

07:02.740 --> 07:05.275
Oh, my God! Sofia has a gay brother, too!

07:05.333 --> 07:06.734
Yay for gay brothers!

07:07.481 --> 07:09.283
Okay, well, I hate to
break it to everybody,

07:09.284 --> 07:11.336
but as co-habitant of said apartment,

07:11.337 --> 07:14.206
I was not informed by the other
co-habitant of this apartment

07:14.207 --> 07:16.575
about this, ah, sub-leasing situation,

07:16.576 --> 07:18.711
so I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

07:18.712 --> 07:22.527
Really? Well, did your co-habitant
tell you we have a contract?

07:25.201 --> 07:26.675
You signed a contract?

07:26.676 --> 07:28.744
Yeah, but you love contracts!

07:30.064 --> 07:34.325
I... I'm so mad right now, I
don't even know where to start.

07:34.326 --> 07:36.641
Sofia, hang on, okay? I have another idea.

07:36.642 --> 07:39.179
Since you don't want them here,
and they don't want to leave,

07:39.180 --> 07:40.865
how about we upgrade them

07:40.866 --> 07:44.154
to my boss' deluxe apartment in the sky?

07:44.155 --> 07:46.197
(Gasps) That sounds so amazing!

07:46.198 --> 07:47.940
No, no, no, I don't want to be in the sky.

07:47.941 --> 07:50.334
I want to be here with
the view of the parade.

07:50.335 --> 07:53.638
Seriously, so now you're just
offering Josh's apartment?

07:53.639 --> 07:55.740
I... I can't believe you, Gabi.

07:55.741 --> 07:57.742
You know what? I... hm... huh...

07:57.864 --> 07:59.458
actually, I can believe it!

07:59.459 --> 08:01.515
Because you do things
like this all the time!

08:01.516 --> 08:04.543
Well, I wouldn't do things like this
all the time if you didn't always say no.

08:04.544 --> 08:08.284
I wouldn't have to say no, Gabi, if-if you
weren't acting like an irresponsible child.

08:08.587 --> 08:10.921
Oh, my God. When did you
get such a stick up your ass?

08:10.987 --> 08:14.230
I don't know, maybe you put
it there without asking me.

08:15.573 --> 08:16.808
What's happening, Sofia?

08:16.809 --> 08:19.775
We used to have fun and hang
out and do stupid stuff together.

08:19.776 --> 08:21.244
We grew up, Gabi,

08:21.245 --> 08:22.445
or at least I did.

08:22.637 --> 08:25.627
Well, if growing up means acting
like you, then I don't want to.

08:25.628 --> 08:27.029
And that's exactly the point.

08:27.030 --> 08:29.064
I've grown up, and you haven't.

08:29.065 --> 08:31.499
So, maybe the truth is we've
just actually grown apart.

08:31.500 --> 08:32.701
(Gasps)

08:32.702 --> 08:35.692
Oh, well, maybe we have.

08:37.996 --> 08:39.462
I'm sorry you had to see that.

08:40.523 --> 08:43.191
Oh, it's okay. We just had
the same argument in the car.

08:48.996 --> 08:52.330
I'm growing apart from her?
I'm a child with stupid ideas?

08:52.331 --> 08:54.191
Well, how stupid is this?

08:55.752 --> 08:57.998
Stupid awesome!

08:59.370 --> 09:00.638
Oh, my God.

09:01.147 --> 09:03.906
I am so glad I decided to come with you.

09:03.907 --> 09:05.140
Yeah, you are.

09:07.722 --> 09:11.457
Thank you so much for letting
me stay in... my apartment.

09:12.569 --> 09:14.869
I hope the stick up my ass
doesn't get in your way.

09:15.881 --> 09:17.582
Oh, please.

09:17.583 --> 09:20.218
With all the sticks Gracie's
told me I have up my ass,

09:20.219 --> 09:21.819
I could start a Popsicle factory.

09:23.957 --> 09:26.633
Oh, my God. You travel
with your own coasters?

09:26.634 --> 09:29.193
- Yeah, is that crazy?
- It's crazy awesome!

09:29.194 --> 09:30.394
(Laughing)

09:31.640 --> 09:34.015
Wow. I've never been this high before.

09:34.222 --> 09:36.308
Just kidding. I totally have.

09:36.342 --> 09:38.717
(Chuckles) That's really funny.

09:38.718 --> 09:40.820
You know, Sofia used
to make jokes like that.

09:40.821 --> 09:42.320
Now, the only joke she makes is,

09:42.321 --> 09:43.583
"Knock, knock. Who's there?

09:43.584 --> 09:44.784
Shut up, we're broke."

09:45.814 --> 09:47.215
And last week, Gabi...

09:47.216 --> 09:48.616
(phone beeps)

09:48.803 --> 09:50.686
Oh, it's Gabi texting me.

09:50.687 --> 09:52.921
- Probably wanting to apologize.
- Mm-hmm.

09:52.990 --> 09:55.024
Nope, it's just a picture of her butt.

09:56.980 --> 09:58.346
You want to get her back?

09:58.380 --> 10:00.648
Ignore her. Be the bigger person.

10:01.683 --> 10:03.417
Where have you been all my life?

10:06.211 --> 10:07.778
What did they text back?

10:07.779 --> 10:09.646
Nothing. They can't think of a comeback.

10:09.647 --> 10:11.547
- They're so boring.
- I know.

10:11.548 --> 10:13.068
Hey, you know what's not boring?

10:13.388 --> 10:14.918
Couponing!

10:15.822 --> 10:17.022
Margaritas!

10:17.023 --> 10:18.223
Yeah!

10:22.969 --> 10:24.770
Oh, it's good to take a little break.

10:24.771 --> 10:26.217
- Oh, you need a break?
- No, do you?

10:26.218 --> 10:27.418
- No.
- Gotcha.

10:27.774 --> 10:29.775
I could party like this every day.

10:29.810 --> 10:31.174
Me too.

10:32.243 --> 10:34.611
My heart feels like it's about to explode.

10:34.736 --> 10:36.704
From all the fun and excitement.

10:36.705 --> 10:38.024
Oh.

10:38.025 --> 10:40.461
And my feet are throbbing.

10:40.803 --> 10:42.403
To the rhythm of the techno.

10:43.988 --> 10:46.094
You know what? Let's go change outfits,

10:46.095 --> 10:48.564
so we can get back out there.

10:49.169 --> 10:50.525
You know it.

10:51.238 --> 10:52.972
But, you know what else?

10:53.007 --> 10:56.843
I'm noticing you get a better
view of the parade from right here.

10:57.232 --> 11:00.500
I wonder if it's even better sitting down?

11:01.780 --> 11:03.214
Let me see.

11:04.585 --> 11:06.419
But just for a brief mo.

11:08.780 --> 11:10.848
(Both sigh)

11:15.021 --> 11:17.155
So, as our lives become easier,

11:17.156 --> 11:20.525
the computers doing our jobs will
be the ones who'll need therapy.

11:20.559 --> 11:24.329
And thanks to my algorithm,
they'll be able to get it.

11:24.330 --> 11:25.530
(Audience gasps)

11:26.362 --> 11:27.951
Reminds me of a joke.

11:28.667 --> 11:31.503
Why was the computer stressed
out when it got home from work?

11:32.429 --> 11:35.028
'Cause it had a hard drive.

11:35.029 --> 11:36.229
(Audience laughs)

11:36.277 --> 11:37.477
Did you hear that?

11:37.680 --> 11:39.301
No. No, he stole my joke!

11:39.352 --> 11:41.320
(Laughing)

11:41.321 --> 11:42.588
(Laughing)

11:42.589 --> 11:44.056
My gosh, you're so right.

11:44.057 --> 11:46.294
Having a few friends over
totally mellowed me out.

11:46.359 --> 11:49.261
Or maybe it's the pitcher of margaritas?

11:50.059 --> 11:51.360
That too.

11:51.361 --> 11:53.028
(Phone beeps)

11:53.564 --> 11:56.403
Oh, some more margarita
drinkers are on their way up.

11:56.404 --> 11:58.701
- Fun! Oh...
- (Phone rings)

11:58.918 --> 12:00.988
oh, it's my boss.

12:01.082 --> 12:03.138
You buzz your friends
in, I'll handle this guy.

12:05.445 --> 12:06.645
<i>Hey, boss.</i>

12:06.646 --> 12:08.743
Gabi, this is a disaster!

12:08.744 --> 12:10.520
I'm trying to call Elliot,
and he's not picking up.

12:10.521 --> 12:11.450
What's wrong?

12:11.451 --> 12:13.277
The guy before me stole my joke!

12:14.581 --> 12:17.216
What? Why would he steal that...

12:17.250 --> 12:18.605
awesome joke.

12:19.032 --> 12:21.551
Because of its awesomeness, Gabi.

12:22.557 --> 12:26.459
And now... now, I'm about to go on,
and something weird is happening to me.

12:26.460 --> 12:29.400
My... my... my hands are
shaking, I'm starting to sweat.

12:29.401 --> 12:32.226
Okay, well, it's just stage fright,
okay? It happens to everybody.

12:32.227 --> 12:33.427
Not me.

12:37.192 --> 12:39.326
Oh, wow, my chest is tight.

12:39.327 --> 12:41.136
Okay, just take a deep breath.

12:41.137 --> 12:44.229
If it gets bad during your talk, just
picture the audience in their underwear.

12:44.230 --> 12:45.897
Hey, funny man, you're on.

12:45.898 --> 12:47.340
Oh, I gotta go on.

12:47.937 --> 12:50.050
I knew I should have brought my harmonica.

12:50.227 --> 12:52.662
(Rock music playing)

12:53.127 --> 12:54.327
Ah!

12:54.711 --> 12:55.911
Wah!

12:56.433 --> 12:58.834
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

12:58.835 --> 13:00.199
Gracie?

13:01.372 --> 13:04.308
Gracie! Gracie, you said a few
of your friends were coming up.

13:04.309 --> 13:07.010
Oh, calm down. The rest
will be here real soon.

13:07.077 --> 13:08.812
(Glass breaking)

13:09.036 --> 13:11.815
Please welcome to the
Ed stage, Josh Kaminski.

13:11.816 --> 13:12.960
(Audience applauds)

13:12.961 --> 13:14.395
Dude, you're on.

13:17.738 --> 13:19.859
I said podium down! Oh, never mind.

13:23.972 --> 13:25.172
Hi.

13:26.927 --> 13:29.488
I'm Josh Kaminski.

13:31.139 --> 13:32.595
And, uh...

13:33.511 --> 13:36.849
Today, I'd like to... talk to you about...

13:37.164 --> 13:38.832
(Inhales deeply)

13:38.833 --> 13:40.434
about...

13:45.861 --> 13:47.061
It worked.

13:47.870 --> 13:53.607
Today, I would like to talk to you
about alternate paths to success.

13:57.098 --> 13:58.564
Uh-oh.

13:59.844 --> 14:01.044
Down, boy.

14:02.270 --> 14:04.138
How do we measure succ-sex?

14:04.139 --> 14:06.641
(Chuckles) Sex. Sex.

14:06.804 --> 14:08.104
Success.

14:08.964 --> 14:10.599
Well, it's hard.

14:10.900 --> 14:13.635
It is really hard. I wish it wasn't hard...

14:17.419 --> 14:18.719
but it is.

14:20.399 --> 14:21.833
We each have our own path.

14:25.217 --> 14:27.865
Is it straight? Not always.

14:28.253 --> 14:30.954
Is it long? Everything's relative!

14:32.210 --> 14:33.410
(Audience gasps)

14:39.070 --> 14:41.048
Oh, not the gasp I was hoping for.

14:46.873 --> 14:48.407
What a rush.

14:48.408 --> 14:51.235
Ha-ha! I can't believe
I've never couponed before.

14:51.236 --> 14:52.903
You would never know it.

14:52.962 --> 14:54.363
Thank you.

14:56.092 --> 14:57.626
What are you doing?

14:57.627 --> 14:59.324
Oh, just taking my share of the pine sol.

14:59.325 --> 15:01.092
- Your share?
- Yeah.

15:01.093 --> 15:03.755
You bought it, but I saved
you 40 cents with my coupon,

15:03.756 --> 15:05.512
so just taking my 40 cents worth.

15:05.513 --> 15:06.780
It's fair.

15:07.777 --> 15:11.316
Well, it might be fair, but it's
a little insane, don't you think?

15:11.447 --> 15:13.164
Oh, I get it.

15:13.186 --> 15:16.087
This is because I didn't pay you for gas.

15:16.088 --> 15:20.492
Oh, no, no. I drove five blocks.
I wouldn't charge you for gas.

15:20.493 --> 15:21.880
Well, maybe if you did,

15:21.881 --> 15:24.649
you wouldn't have to rent your house
out to strangers on the Internet.

15:25.243 --> 15:28.604
Whoa. What's happening here?

15:28.974 --> 15:31.446
I thought we were on the same page.

15:31.499 --> 15:33.323
And I think I'm getting a headache. Hmm.

15:33.324 --> 15:34.833
Oh, you want some aspirin?

15:34.834 --> 15:36.135
Uh, yeah, thanks.

15:36.136 --> 15:38.374
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

15:38.538 --> 15:39.955
That'll be 57 cents.

15:42.331 --> 15:44.899
(Rock music playing)

15:48.274 --> 15:50.542
Hey, you know what would be really fun?

15:50.543 --> 15:52.446
If everybody left!

15:54.934 --> 15:56.134
Gracie!

15:56.483 --> 15:57.683
Gabi!

15:57.956 --> 16:00.324
Wait, why are you still wearing a bra?

16:01.137 --> 16:02.471
What the hell is happening?

16:02.472 --> 16:04.039
You gotta get everybody out of here!

16:04.040 --> 16:07.398
Oh, it's just a couple of people. And my
friend Jared thinks you're really cute.

16:07.399 --> 16:08.986
Really? No!

16:09.712 --> 16:11.480
You gotta get everybody out.

16:11.515 --> 16:13.149
Wait, what's happening to you?

16:13.183 --> 16:15.062
You're turning into such a Sofia.

16:15.624 --> 16:16.893
Sofia?

16:17.054 --> 16:18.813
I'm a Sofia?

16:19.056 --> 16:22.350
If I'm turning into a Sofia, the only
reason is because you're acting like a...

16:22.482 --> 16:23.685
oh, my God.

16:24.332 --> 16:25.538
Whoa.

16:25.539 --> 16:27.934
Did you just say "Sofia," like, 12 times?

16:27.935 --> 16:29.790
Or am I really wasted?

16:30.232 --> 16:31.863
(Phone rings)

16:32.970 --> 16:35.405
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, it's my boss!

16:35.577 --> 16:37.088
Help!

16:38.870 --> 16:41.138
Hey, Josh. Pretty quiet.
What's going on there?

16:42.285 --> 16:45.254
Let's just say the Ed
Talk didn't go as planned.

16:46.835 --> 16:48.035
I'm coming home.

16:48.036 --> 16:49.252
What? Home?

16:49.253 --> 16:52.255
Josh, I'm sure it was fine.
You're always so hard on yourself.

16:53.281 --> 16:54.900
You have no idea.

16:55.615 --> 16:57.045
I'm leaving right now.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.951
But... but it's not
Sunday, and you said Sunday.

17:00.086 --> 17:04.464
Gabi, all I wanna do is crawl into my
bed and never see anyone ever again.

17:04.465 --> 17:05.766
See you in 30 minutes.

17:08.404 --> 17:09.704
Oh, God...

17:09.705 --> 17:11.001
Please help.

17:11.002 --> 17:13.445
Show me a way to get those people
out of there and... and I promise

17:13.446 --> 17:15.898
- I'll go to church every week.
- (Elevator dings)

17:15.900 --> 17:17.200
Every other week.

17:17.890 --> 17:19.223
Sofia, what are you doing here?

17:19.224 --> 17:21.010
That Sam was wound way too tight.

17:21.011 --> 17:22.862
Yeah, and Gracie is out of control.

17:22.863 --> 17:25.263
She threw a party, and now
Josh is on his way here,

17:25.265 --> 17:27.875
and there's like a gazillion people
in there, and they won't leave!

17:27.876 --> 17:30.710
This is all my fault. I'm gonna
lose my job. You gotta help me.

17:30.936 --> 17:33.457
Well, I might have a stick up my ass,

17:33.458 --> 17:35.436
but they're about to have a foot up theirs.

17:37.858 --> 17:39.692
Sofia, I don't know what you're gonna do.

17:39.693 --> 17:41.343
I mean, these people are
totally out of control!

17:41.344 --> 17:43.120
We're never gonna get them out of here.

17:44.723 --> 17:46.040
(Whistles)

17:46.041 --> 17:47.241
People!

17:47.242 --> 17:49.843
I'm Sofia Maria Consuela
Rafaella Rodriguez,

17:49.844 --> 17:51.044
and you're done!

17:57.583 --> 17:58.783
(Car honks)

17:58.784 --> 18:00.796
Oh! What's going on?

18:00.850 --> 18:03.130
No, Josh, I'm engaged.

18:03.931 --> 18:05.231
What's happening?

18:05.502 --> 18:07.403
Oh, God. We missed it.

18:07.404 --> 18:10.373
Ugh. The parade has literally passed us by.

18:10.653 --> 18:12.408
Elliot, I have a confession to make.

18:12.409 --> 18:14.522
This holiday is exhausting.

18:14.981 --> 18:18.738
Man wasn't made to dance
for more than 10 minutes.

18:19.397 --> 18:22.767
Celebrations should have places to sit.

18:24.006 --> 18:25.639
Let's face it,

18:25.829 --> 18:27.030
we're old.

18:27.122 --> 18:28.370
Yes.

18:28.675 --> 18:30.324
But, in the spirit of pride,

18:30.450 --> 18:32.412
let's be honest about who we are.

18:35.486 --> 18:38.789
We're old! We're tired! Get used to it!

18:41.021 --> 18:43.953
It doesn't get any better! It gets harder!

18:44.422 --> 18:46.672
I dye my hair!

18:46.987 --> 18:48.755
I buy mine!

18:54.942 --> 18:56.509
- Hi, Josh.
- Hey, what's up?

18:56.510 --> 18:58.511
Nothing! Nothing's up.

19:00.668 --> 19:01.868
Ugh.

19:02.124 --> 19:03.403
What a nightmare.

19:03.404 --> 19:04.838
Tell me about it.

19:04.839 --> 19:07.373
This weekend was supposed to be so great.

19:07.383 --> 19:08.883
It turned into a disaster.

19:08.884 --> 19:10.239
- I hear you.
- Totally get it.

19:10.952 --> 19:15.662
I have never felt so naked and exposed.

19:16.212 --> 19:17.745
And sad.

19:17.746 --> 19:19.116
And alone.

19:19.117 --> 19:21.874
It's like you think you
know what you're doing.

19:21.875 --> 19:23.742
You got it all planned out.

19:24.004 --> 19:27.069
Yeah, but you know there's nothing wrong
with planning. Planning can be good.

19:27.575 --> 19:29.076
Aww.

19:29.161 --> 19:32.008
And then something pops up out of nowhere

19:32.009 --> 19:34.219
and takes you completely by surprise.

19:35.178 --> 19:36.883
But there's nothing wrong with surprises.

19:36.884 --> 19:38.282
You know, surprises can be fun.

19:38.316 --> 19:39.675
Aww.

19:40.676 --> 19:42.352
But, hey, you know what's great?

19:42.605 --> 19:45.211
Being able to come home and be
with people who make you feel good.

19:45.212 --> 19:47.453
Oh, I missed you so much!

19:47.454 --> 19:48.654
I missed you more!

19:49.535 --> 19:51.022
I've only been gone like three hours.

19:51.614 --> 19:54.148
- I love you so much!
- I love you more!

19:54.765 --> 19:55.965
This is nice.

19:55.966 --> 19:57.498
This is uplifting.

19:59.663 --> 20:01.348
Maybe a little too uplifting.

20:01.860 --> 20:04.303
Not again, not again, not
again, not again, not again...

20:08.156 --> 20:11.042
Elliot, my speech was a complete failure.

20:11.144 --> 20:12.590
Your speech was,

20:12.591 --> 20:15.032
but your song's a raging success.

20:15.033 --> 20:16.313
What are you talking about?

20:16.347 --> 20:19.538
As your publicist, I took
matters into my own hands

20:19.539 --> 20:21.118
to get in front of the story.

20:22.420 --> 20:24.810
<i>Hi, I'm Josh Kaminski.</i>

20:24.811 --> 20:26.525
How do we measure success?

20:26.526 --> 20:29.102
(Electronic music plays)

20:29.103 --> 20:31.161
♪ Well, it's hard, hard, hard ♪

20:31.162 --> 20:32.698
<i>♪ it's really hard ♪</i>

20:32.699 --> 20:34.860
<i>♪ really hard. I wish it wasn't hard ♪</i>

20:34.861 --> 20:35.933
but it is.

20:35.934 --> 20:37.767
In life, <i>♪ you have to behands on ♪</i>

20:37.768 --> 20:39.883
<i>♪ hands on, you have to
be hands on, hands on ♪</i>

20:39.884 --> 20:42.105
I mean, that's really good.
That must've taken you forever.

20:42.106 --> 20:44.674
Yeah. It was really hard.

20:44.803 --> 20:46.003
