Here, take these.

39:10.590 --> 39:12.557
They'll help
with that headache.

39:15.020 --> 39:16.686
When'd you get in?

39:16.763 --> 39:19.522
Uh, first light.

39:19.599 --> 39:23.309
After our talk yesterday,
I couldn't shake the feeling

39:23.386 --> 39:26.020
that maybe you needed a friend
out here.

39:26.031 --> 39:28.031
Turns out you have several.

39:28.108 --> 39:30.200
Could always use another.

39:30.276 --> 39:32.318
Thank you for coming.

39:32.395 --> 39:34.654
Y'all put a real hurt
on that fire, by the way.

39:34.730 --> 39:37.949
Between the containment line
and the rain last night,

39:38.025 --> 39:39.659
they're saying it's boxed in.

39:39.735 --> 39:43.037
Commander dismissed
all the out-of-state crews.

So if y'all get hungry,
there's a great barbecue place

39:51.464 --> 39:53.047
in Fort Stockton
called Rudy's Ribs.

39:53.058 --> 39:54.391
You just tell 'em
that Judd sent you.

39:54.467 --> 39:56.134
Thanks, but I think
we're gonna go

39:56.210 --> 39:59.062
to my parents' in El Paso
to eat.

39:59.139 --> 40:01.231
Judd, you're all right,

40:01.307 --> 40:02.557
even if you were a bulldog.

40:02.567 --> 40:04.058
Well, it makes sense

40:04.069 --> 40:06.144
that a California firefighter
as good as you

40:06.220 --> 40:08.187
had to have been raised
in Texas, so...

40:08.264 --> 40:10.982
All right, brother.

40:11.058 --> 40:12.316
Hey, Marwani.

40:12.393 --> 40:14.569
Was hoping I could get a pic
for Insta.

40:14.579 --> 40:16.654
I thought you were off
social media.

40:16.731 --> 40:19.365
Yeah, well, it's not every day
you get to take a selfie

40:19.442 --> 40:21.626

way too much pretty.

40:56.121 --> 40:58.237
Can't thank you enough.

It's what we do, right?

41:01.651 --> 41:05.119
Ooh, hey, if you ever
find yourself in LA,

41:05.130 --> 41:06.629
we should get together.

41:06.706 --> 41:08.581
Sure.

41:08.658 --> 41:10.416
I gotta mention, though,
I already have a boyfriend

41:10.493 --> 41:12.969
and it's pretty serious, so...

41:13.046 --> 41:15.129
but it was really nice
meeting you, man.

41:15.140 --> 41:16.214
Take care.

Uh--oh.

Great working with you, man.

Great working with you too.

41:20.294 --> 41:22.437
Where's Hen?

41:25.508 --> 41:28.434
I'd say I'm glad to see you
back on your feet,

41:28.511 --> 41:32.104
but you shouldn't be
back on your feet.

41:32.181 --> 41:33.305
I heard you were shipping out,

41:33.383 --> 41:36.993
and I wanted to make sure
I caught you.

41:37.070 --> 41:40.655
I'm still amazed we made it
out of there alive.

41:40.665 --> 41:42.832
Told you.
I'm invincible.

41:42.909 --> 41:44.992
(chuckles)

41:45.003 --> 41:48.454
Is that really your takeaway
from the experience?

41:48.531 --> 41:51.123
I cannot think
of a more logical explanation

41:51.200 --> 41:52.416
for how we survived what we did

41:52.493 --> 41:55.503
and still walked
out of there alive.

41:55.514 --> 41:58.923
Well, actually, I can think
of about two teams

41:59.000 --> 42:00.800
of logical explanations.

42:00.876 --> 42:04.395
And we didn't walk out.
We were carried out.

42:06.173 --> 42:08.683
Who knew you could get
so stoned on oxygen?

<i> In O2 veritas.</i>

42:13.222 --> 42:15.106
Pure oxygen can give rise

42:15.182 --> 42:18.034
to feelings of euphoria.

42:18.111 --> 42:22.697
Yeah, I'm not so sure it was
euphoria I was feeling.

42:22.707 --> 42:25.950
What happens in the mineshaft
stays in the mineshaft.

42:26.027 --> 42:29.537
I appreciate that.

42:29.548 --> 42:31.214
Maybe that's not the only thing

42:31.291 --> 42:34.125
that could stay
in the mineshaft.

42:34.201 --> 42:36.335

leave some of those ghosts
