01:33.000 --> 01:37.073
?Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum

01:37.120 --> 01:40.078
? Fifteen men on a dead man's chest

01:40.120 --> 01:44.398
? Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum... ?

01:44.440 --> 01:46.032
(Drunken chatter and laughter)

01:46.080 --> 01:47.718
Avast!

01:51.240 --> 01:52.639
Hello, boys.

01:52.680 --> 01:57.196
Shiver me timbers, it's Captain Fritton!

01:57.240 --> 01:59.595
(Laughs)

02:05.520 --> 02:07.511
Not the fearsome Captain Fritton?

02:07.560 --> 02:11.075
(Chuckles) Is that what they're saying
about me these days? How delightful.

02:11.120 --> 02:13.759
Not the Captain Fritton
that's robbed a thousand ships

02:13.800 --> 02:15.119
and turned the Black Sea red?

02:15.160 --> 02:17.628
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- That Fritton?

02:17.680 --> 02:22.390
You don't want to believe everything
you read on the wanted poster.

02:22.440 --> 02:25.034
Now, look here, I'm in an awful hurry -
where's Lord Pomfrey?

02:29.520 --> 02:31.829
Ah, what an honour!

02:33.680 --> 02:36.717
The famous Captain Fritton
aboard my humble vessel.

02:36.760 --> 02:39.479
(Chuckles) Lord Pomfrey.

02:39.520 --> 02:41.238
I've heard so much about you.

02:41.280 --> 02:44.795
Oh, likewise.
I say, golly gosh.

02:45.920 --> 02:49.276
- This looks like the real thing.
- This isn't just treasure, Fritton.

02:49.320 --> 02:50.992
Really? Looks like treasure to me.

02:51.040 --> 02:54.350
This is the solution to the greatest
threat mankind has ever known.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.038
(Fritton) Ha ha! Which is?

02:57.360 --> 02:59.874
There is a wench
on the throne of England.

02:59.920 --> 03:02.229
There's nothing wrong with the Queen.

03:02.280 --> 03:06.034
There is everything wrong with men taking
orders from the weaker sex. (Grunts)

03:06.080 --> 03:07.991
- Aargh!
- Ah!

03:09.080 --> 03:12.311
Besides,
I rather enjoy a woman on top.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.794
You won't get away with this, Fritton!

03:15.880 --> 03:17.598
I don't see why not.

03:17.640 --> 03:22.794
After all, with this haul I can retire,
put my feet up. Write my memoirs.

03:22.840 --> 03:25.035
I'd start writing quickly, if I were you,

03:25.080 --> 03:28.629
because we will hunt you down
like the scurvy dog you are!

03:28.680 --> 03:32.309
Whether it takes two years,
twenty years...

03:32.360 --> 03:34.999
or four hundred and twenty years!

03:35.760 --> 03:37.876
Aargh!

03:43.800 --> 03:47.395
? I predict a riot
I predict a riot

03:49.600 --> 03:52.797
? I predict a riot
I predict a riot

03:55.000 --> 03:57.275
- ? And if there's anybody left in here
- (Siren blaring)

03:57.320 --> 04:03.759
? That doesn't want to be out there

04:03.800 --> 04:08.032
? I predict a riot
I predict a riot

04:08.080 --> 04:11.390
- OK, T ania, into fifth!
- ? I predict a riot

04:11.440 --> 04:14.159
- ? I predict a riot
- (Both) Whoo!

04:15.280 --> 04:20.832
? And if there's anybody left in here
that doesn't want to be out there

04:20.880 --> 04:23.155
- ? I predict...
- Why did you stop?

04:23.200 --> 04:25.395
We're out of our jurisdiction.

04:26.440 --> 04:28.237
Two eleven to control, over.

04:28.280 --> 04:30.157
(Radio) Over, two eleven.

04:30.200 --> 04:31.599
They're back.

04:33.320 --> 04:34.799
(Cheering)

04:51.240 --> 04:52.878
Hi.

04:56.280 --> 04:57.679
(Horn beeping)

04:57.720 --> 05:00.712
? Watching the people get lairy

05:00.760 --> 05:06.392
? It's not very pretty, I tell thee
Walking through town is quite scary

05:06.440 --> 05:13.835
? And not very sensible
La-a-a, la-la-la-la-la-la

05:13.880 --> 05:16.394
- Morning, Bursar.
- Morning, Bursar.

05:16.440 --> 05:21.560
? La-la-la-la-la-la

05:21.600 --> 05:23.079
(All) Oh!

05:29.640 --> 05:33.474
? I predict a riot
I predict a riot

05:35.400 --> 05:39.393
? I predict a riot
I predict a riot...

05:40.440 --> 05:44.877
- Hey, Roxy, promise you'll write me?
- (Sighs)

05:50.640 --> 05:52.835
- Love you, babe.
- Whatever.

05:52.880 --> 05:54.279
? I predict a riot

05:54.720 --> 05:56.358
? I predict a riot ?

05:58.880 --> 06:02.714
(All) Oh...my...God!

06:04.360 --> 06:06.078
So, what's he like?

06:06.120 --> 06:08.395
Grazia said he was totally wild.
Is he wild?

06:08.440 --> 06:11.432
- You just need to know how to tame him.
- (Sighs)

06:11.480 --> 06:15.268
- So have you, you know...?
- What goes on tour, stays on tour.

06:15.320 --> 06:17.550
- That means she didn't.
- That means she did.

06:17.600 --> 06:18.589
(All giggle)

06:19.720 --> 06:23.474
- Namaste.
- You look well. Nice holiday?

06:23.520 --> 06:26.717
Thanks, love, I've just been to lndia.
Me mate Becky's getting married.

06:26.760 --> 06:29.752
- A hen do?
- No, she's Church of England, I think.

06:31.200 --> 06:32.997
(Headmistress) Enter.

06:39.880 --> 06:41.950
(Chuckles)

06:47.600 --> 06:50.512
Ah, Annabelle, I expect you know
why you've been summoned?

06:50.560 --> 06:53.632
No, Auntie.
Sorry, Miss.

06:54.680 --> 06:57.069
Some women, Annabelle,
are born great.

06:57.120 --> 06:59.998
Cleopatra, the Queen...

07:01.000 --> 07:02.194
..me.

07:02.240 --> 07:05.357
Some become great
like Mother Teresa or Lady Gaga.

07:06.880 --> 07:10.031
Others have greatness
thrust upon them, like Monica Lewinsky.

07:10.080 --> 07:15.234
- You fall into the third category.
- I'm afraid I don't quite understand.

07:15.280 --> 07:17.999
I'm making you Head Girl.

07:18.040 --> 07:20.235
Crikey.

07:20.280 --> 07:23.238
Former Head Girls
have achieved levels of notoriety

07:23.280 --> 07:25.157
that mere mortals can only dream of.

07:25.200 --> 07:31.196
Here is a missive from your predecessor,
the infamous Kelly Jones. (Chuckles)

07:31.240 --> 07:34.949
(Girl laughs) That's so funny.

07:36.120 --> 07:39.237
(Kelly) So hey, Annabelle, I think I'm meant
to pass on some advice,

07:39.280 --> 07:41.874
but what can I say
about a school with no rules?

07:42.880 --> 07:48.273
Remember, if there's one thing about
St Trinian's girls, they can smell fear.

07:48.320 --> 07:49.912
(Snarling)

07:50.880 --> 07:55.590
But, like all predators who hunt in packs,
they want a leader.

07:55.640 --> 07:57.995
Now, that's gotta be you, kiddo.

07:58.800 --> 08:00.995
If you want me, call me. Kelly.

08:01.040 --> 08:03.190
(Grunting)

08:03.240 --> 08:07.836
Amy. Amy. Amy.
T abitha, when you lift heavy objects,

08:07.880 --> 08:09.632
always keep your back straight.

08:10.560 --> 08:11.959
(Gasps, screams)

08:12.000 --> 08:13.399
(Crash)

08:13.440 --> 08:17.035
?..after the party is over
the lights come on and I'm sober...

08:17.080 --> 08:19.594
Oh, don't mind them.
It's just the Flammables.

08:20.920 --> 08:24.196
- Why are they called Flammables?
- Have you seen all that polyester?

08:24.240 --> 08:28.711
Last year one of them took up smoking
and half the school burned down.

08:28.760 --> 08:30.159
Ah.

08:30.200 --> 08:31.599
Oh!

08:31.640 --> 08:33.948
- (Groaning)
- Two words -

08:34.000 --> 08:35.227
(Sighs)

08:35.280 --> 08:37.191
..don't get caught.

08:37.240 --> 08:38.832
Next.

08:42.480 --> 08:43.595
Where do I sling my stuff?

08:43.640 --> 08:46.837
We can make some room in our area,
I suppose.

08:46.880 --> 08:48.996
Yeah, er,
you could so totally hang out with us.

08:49.040 --> 08:51.918
- I mean, you know, if, if you wanted.
- Whatever.

08:51.960 --> 08:54.918
Does she look like she'd want
to hang out with a bunch of shallow,

08:54.960 --> 08:58.748
vacant, facile,
peroxide-blonde turbo-skanks?

09:00.800 --> 09:04.839
You think she'd rather hang out with
you and the sulky, sun-dodging emos?

09:06.600 --> 09:09.319
Yeah, I'd rather have
a midnight algebra feast with the geeks.

09:09.360 --> 09:13.512
- Like we do that!
- Yeah! It was actually trigonometry.

09:13.560 --> 09:16.711
And that's why Lucy
will always be a virgin, ohh.

09:16.760 --> 09:18.591
What, as opposed to a brainless slapper?

09:18.640 --> 09:21.518
Seriously, she'd snog a melon
if you drew a mouth on it.

09:21.560 --> 09:22.959
(All gasp)

09:23.000 --> 09:26.470
That's not fair. It was a grapefruit,
actually, and it was years ago.

09:26.520 --> 09:28.954
Bella, that was a secret!

09:29.000 --> 09:32.788
Well, I suppose she can try saving
the world with the eco-freakos.

09:32.840 --> 09:34.956
(Echoing) Freakos.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.752
- Freakos, freakos, freakos.
- Hey!

09:36.800 --> 09:40.190
Maybe we should let Roxy decide
who she wants to hang around with.

09:40.240 --> 09:41.753
Yeah?

09:43.920 --> 09:47.515
Listen, I'm not planning on
sticking around for long.

09:47.560 --> 09:49.994
- Well, what d'you mean?
- Me and schools don't mix.

09:50.040 --> 09:53.669
So, if it's all the same, I think I'll just
find my own space, cheers.

09:53.720 --> 09:55.597
(All sigh)

09:55.640 --> 09:58.518
- She ain't all that, anyway.
- Whatever!

10:01.200 --> 10:02.599
(Sighs)

10:06.360 --> 10:08.351
Matey.

10:09.360 --> 10:10.998
Camil.

10:12.120 --> 10:17.558
Ah... Ho, ho, ho. (Chuckles)

10:18.720 --> 10:22.759
If you don't mind me saying,
you're still angry, aren't you?

10:22.800 --> 10:25.268
Angry, Fi? No, no, no.

10:25.320 --> 10:30.269
Not angry.
I'm just, er, very, very...very...

10:38.200 --> 10:40.509
..disappointed.

10:42.080 --> 10:45.197
- Next.
- Is that all you got?

10:47.400 --> 10:48.799
(Tries to whistle)

10:52.280 --> 10:53.793
Hi, guys.

10:54.080 --> 10:56.674
- ?..don't care about no one but me
- Hi, guys.

10:56.720 --> 10:59.917
- ? Get that girl a lifetime away from me
- Hi, guys.

11:01.600 --> 11:02.953
Hi, guys.

11:04.120 --> 11:06.350
Hi, guys!

11:09.240 --> 11:12.357
As the new head of the student body,

11:12.400 --> 11:14.960
I thought we could hold a meeting
every Wednesday

11:15.000 --> 11:17.309
to give everyone the opportunity
to propose new ideas

11:17.360 --> 11:19.271
about the day-to-day running of the school.

11:22.320 --> 11:25.392
(All laugh hysterically)

11:29.760 --> 11:32.797
Oh, God, you nearly had us there,
Annabelle.

11:33.520 --> 11:37.195
Hey, girls, girls, girls, look,
she really is Head Girl.

11:37.960 --> 11:40.190
Talk about keeping it in the family.

11:41.840 --> 11:43.876
(Beeping)

11:43.920 --> 11:45.319
Hey, guys,

11:45.360 --> 11:48.477
we just got something really suspicious
on CCTV.

11:48.520 --> 11:49.999
Someone just went into the library.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.399
The library?

11:52.440 --> 11:54.396
I didn't know we had a library.

12:08.560 --> 12:11.074
- Who's that?
- I don't know.

12:17.280 --> 12:18.679
(Screams)

12:18.720 --> 12:20.278
Oh, my gosh.

12:45.040 --> 12:46.155
(Cough)

12:47.600 --> 12:50.831
Care to explain what's going on, Celia?

12:50.880 --> 12:54.919
Er... Maybe. No.

12:54.960 --> 12:56.279
I'll get my tongs.

12:56.320 --> 12:58.550
On second thought, why not?
Happy to.

12:58.600 --> 13:01.478
Oh, I never get to use my tongs!

13:01.520 --> 13:04.796
Basically, this, like...
man totally asked me to find it.

13:04.840 --> 13:06.034
What man?

13:06.080 --> 13:08.514
- I can't say.
- I'll get my tongs.

13:08.560 --> 13:09.834
I can't say, cos I don't know.

13:09.880 --> 13:11.871
- (Sighs)
- I've never seen him before.

13:11.920 --> 13:15.469
He told me where it was,
said he'd pay me 20.000 if I got it.

13:15.520 --> 13:21.277
Ha! £20.000 for that?
It looks like something Bianca would wear.

13:21.320 --> 13:24.676
What were you going to spend £20.000 on?

13:24.720 --> 13:25.994
Turbines.

13:28.320 --> 13:29.912
Wind power.

13:31.400 --> 13:34.198
The ice caps are melting.

13:34.240 --> 13:36.708
Sea levels are rising.

13:36.760 --> 13:42.915
Climate change is the most important
issue our generation faces.

13:42.960 --> 13:47.192
With this money we could make
this school carbon neutral.

13:53.240 --> 13:55.231
Yeah.

13:55.280 --> 14:01.150
Or we could slide the ring over,
split the cash and get our Gucci on!

14:02.960 --> 14:06.589
Well, judging by the shapes
and the markings...

14:08.720 --> 14:10.950
..I'd say it was a ring.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.309
- Duh!
- Definitely a ring.

14:13.360 --> 14:15.078
Good.

14:15.120 --> 14:17.634
- Any idea how old?
- Yep.

14:17.680 --> 14:20.114
- That's my girl.
- Here we go.

14:22.120 --> 14:23.439
It's well old.

14:23.480 --> 14:24.993
Idiot.

14:25.040 --> 14:27.156
Jess, man, what are you up to?

14:27.200 --> 14:32.957
Look, it ain't about its market value.
It's about what it's worth to the individual.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.399
She's right.

14:34.440 --> 14:37.955
The way I see it,
twenty's just his opening bid.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.560
I reckon we should squeeze him
for double that.

14:40.600 --> 14:44.673
- 40, maybe 50 grand.
- £50,000?

14:44.720 --> 14:46.039
(All gasp)

14:46.080 --> 14:48.355
Now you are talking!

14:48.400 --> 14:49.799
(Chirping)

14:51.320 --> 14:53.151
Um... That's him.

14:53.200 --> 14:55.395
(Phone chirping)

14:57.640 --> 15:00.632
- Kung-fu grip.
- No, Chinese burn!

15:00.680 --> 15:04.355
Head Girl badge.
I'll do the talking.

15:04.400 --> 15:06.038
(Phone chirping)

15:08.680 --> 15:10.159
Go on.

15:10.200 --> 15:13.510
You're talking to Annabelle Fritton,
Head Girl of St Trinian's.

15:13.560 --> 15:20.636
Well, well, well, little Miss Fritton.
I made you an offer, £20.000.

15:20.680 --> 15:22.591
Deal or no deal?

15:22.640 --> 15:24.437
- No deal.
- No deal.

15:24.480 --> 15:27.790
- That showed him.
- (Girls squealing)

15:29.240 --> 15:30.434
(Annabelle) Wait. Shh.

15:30.480 --> 15:32.596
- Excuse me?
- I said, no deal.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.596
- We want...
- 50.

15:34.640 --> 15:36.153
We want...

15:38.800 --> 15:40.119
Go on.

15:40.160 --> 15:44.517
..£100,000.

15:44.560 --> 15:45.709
What is she doing?

15:45.760 --> 15:48.115
I was prepared to be nice.

15:48.160 --> 15:50.310
I was even prepared to be generous,

15:50.360 --> 15:52.669
and then you insult my generosity.

15:52.720 --> 15:56.474
The offer is off the table. No money.

15:56.520 --> 15:57.714
Now, look here, mister,

15:57.760 --> 16:00.957
do you have any idea
who you're dealing with?

16:01.000 --> 16:05.039
No, no, no, little Fritton,
the question is, do you?

16:05.080 --> 16:07.310
Because you're about to find out.

16:12.560 --> 16:14.516
- 100,000 quid?
- Are you mad?

16:14.560 --> 16:16.869
For God's sake, Annabelle.

16:16.920 --> 16:18.319
(Phone ringing)

16:20.920 --> 16:22.148
Kelly, it's Annabelle.

16:22.200 --> 16:23.428
Annabelle. Hey-hey.

16:23.480 --> 16:25.789
Hi. Listen, have you got a minute?

16:28.000 --> 16:29.399
Yeah, I got a minute.

16:29.440 --> 16:31.317
How's life, Head Girl?

16:31.360 --> 16:35.433
Oh, you know, it's, um, it's great.
Well, not great, but good.

16:35.480 --> 16:37.038
What's happened?

16:37.080 --> 16:39.230
(Sighs) Oh, it's nothing terrible, it's just...

16:39.280 --> 16:42.590
this creepy guy tried to buy
an ancient ring off Celia,

16:42.640 --> 16:45.552
and he offered her £20.000
and then I went and asked for a hundred.

16:45.600 --> 16:47.909
Then he threatened us.
I think he might be dangerous.

16:47.960 --> 16:50.758
Now everyone wants to kill me,
and I don't know what to do.

16:50.800 --> 16:53.633
Sounds like another day at St Trinian's.

16:55.400 --> 16:58.153
- I've gotta go.
- I don't think I'm handling this as well as l...

16:58.200 --> 17:01.033
If you wanna take the lead,
you've gotta act like you know the way.

17:01.080 --> 17:03.640
Kelly, I've got a bad feeling about this.

17:03.680 --> 17:06.194
- Yes!
- Kelly? Kelly?

17:06.240 --> 17:07.752
Gotta fly. Ciao.

17:07.800 --> 17:10.519
Oh, hang on a minute... (Sighs)

17:12.359 --> 17:16.239
(Man) Breathe deeply.
Now, rise up into the tangled scorpion.

17:16.280 --> 17:18.839
And hold, and hold.

17:18.880 --> 17:20.871
(Clamour)

17:20.920 --> 17:22.558
- And hold and hold.
- (Bell)

17:23.359 --> 17:24.509
- (Screams)
- (Crash)

17:24.560 --> 17:27.279
Go on, go on, go on! Shoo, shoo, shoo!
Get in! Get in, everyone!

17:27.319 --> 17:29.117
(Clamour)

17:29.160 --> 17:31.993
OK, guys, Paris opens in three.

17:32.040 --> 17:33.758
Let's get busy.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.870
Gold's up. Gold's up.

17:35.920 --> 17:37.592
Jean-Claude, comment ça va? Talk to me.

17:40.120 --> 17:42.270
(Screams)

17:45.720 --> 17:49.759
Excellent work, girls.
A, er...a very apposite example

17:49.800 --> 17:53.759
of one of the many uses of electricity
in the modern world.

17:57.880 --> 17:58.869
Who's next?

18:01.880 --> 18:03.836
Zoe.

18:04.760 --> 18:08.070
? Cos I can get what I want

18:08.120 --> 18:09.712
? The more that I dream

18:09.760 --> 18:13.150
(All) ? The harder it seems,
oh, believe me, yeah...

18:18.160 --> 18:20.151
Huh?

18:21.160 --> 18:23.674
It's an electric chair, Miss.

18:23.720 --> 18:26.188
? Can get what I want

18:26.240 --> 18:27.719
? The more that I dream

18:27.760 --> 18:31.036
? The harder it seems,
oh, believe me, yeah

18:31.600 --> 18:33.033
? Can get what I want

18:33.080 --> 18:34.798
? Can get what I need

18:34.840 --> 18:37.877
? So give in to me, oh, it's easy, yeah

18:37.920 --> 18:41.799
? I can get what I want
the more that I dream

18:41.840 --> 18:44.638
? The harder I scream,
oh, believe me, yeah...

18:44.680 --> 18:48.593
See you in the Underworld.

18:50.680 --> 18:51.749
What the...

18:51.800 --> 18:53.870
? The harder I try, the ha...

18:55.240 --> 18:57.435
What's happened? Get me power.

18:57.480 --> 19:00.756
Seriously, if you didn't want me to sing,
you should just say so.

19:04.280 --> 19:06.316
I'm going to rather enjoy this.

19:06.360 --> 19:09.397
Would anyone care
to tell me what's going on?

19:09.800 --> 19:15.716
So, basically like...this guy,
he offered me £20.000

19:15.760 --> 19:18.274
for a ring from the Fritton archives. So l...

19:18.320 --> 19:22.359
So, we figured anybody
who's willing to pay 20 would...

19:22.400 --> 19:23.674
Pay 50.

19:23.720 --> 19:26.792
But Annabelle went and asked for 100.

19:26.840 --> 19:28.478
(All) Yeah.

19:28.520 --> 19:29.873
- (Sighs)
- ldiot.

19:29.920 --> 19:31.478
May I see this ring?

19:33.120 --> 19:34.189
Go on.

19:37.760 --> 19:40.228
I mean, what we don't get, Miss, yeah,

19:40.280 --> 19:44.876
is why anyone would shell out
big benjis for some budget bling.

19:48.720 --> 19:51.188
Anyone wouldn't, Bianca.

19:53.240 --> 19:57.472
Unless, of course...
the legend were true.

19:57.520 --> 19:59.112
What legend?

20:00.760 --> 20:02.239
(Chuckles)

20:03.800 --> 20:06.268
The legend of the Fritton gold.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.158
(Both) Is this a scary story, Miss?

20:09.200 --> 20:11.555
- (Laughs)
- What?

20:11.600 --> 20:14.114
It is a dark and stormy night,

20:14.160 --> 20:17.994
and the year is 1589.

20:19.960 --> 20:23.999
We're sailing on the high seas
aboard a galleon,

20:24.040 --> 20:27.589
captained by the villainous
Lord Pomfrey.

20:27.640 --> 20:29.392
(Laughs)

20:29.440 --> 20:33.274
His cargo is a vast horde
of glittering treasure.

20:33.320 --> 20:36.710
His destination, the coast of England,

20:36.760 --> 20:43.518
where he plans to use that treasure to bring
down our own great Queen who? Hmm?

20:44.880 --> 20:46.108
Elizabeth l?

20:46.160 --> 20:48.833
Absolutely right, Jemima.

20:50.920 --> 20:54.037
Oh, the ship ploughs through the waves,

20:54.080 --> 20:57.834
rising and plunging,
her timbers creak.

20:59.760 --> 21:01.990
Her rigging slaps against the mainsail.

21:03.880 --> 21:05.438
When suddenly,

21:05.480 --> 21:07.994
out of the black night,

21:08.040 --> 21:10.713
swoops a fearsome figure.

21:10.760 --> 21:12.273
- "Avast!"...
- (Girls gasp)

21:12.320 --> 21:15.392
(Laughs)..he cried.

21:15.440 --> 21:18.750
And swinging like a cat onto the deck...

21:19.600 --> 21:21.352
..is Pirate Fritton.

21:21.400 --> 21:23.356
Fritton - is that...?

21:23.400 --> 21:27.632
Yes, dear, our ancestor,
Archibald Fritton,

21:27.680 --> 21:30.558
handsome sea dog,
who boards the ship,

21:30.600 --> 21:32.989
overpowers the crew...

21:34.280 --> 21:35.952
..and makes off with the treasure.

21:36.000 --> 21:40.835
- Oh, oh, my, that is gangsta.
- It certainly is.

21:40.880 --> 21:43.155
So, so, like,
what, what happened to him?

21:43.200 --> 21:47.671
Neither hide nor hair of him
was ever heard of or seen since.

21:47.720 --> 21:49.119
And the treasure?

21:49.160 --> 21:51.435
Well, as the legend goes,

21:51.480 --> 21:55.519
Iike all good pirates,
he hid the treasure and made a map.

21:55.560 --> 22:00.156
This was no ordinary map, Sienna.

22:00.200 --> 22:03.192
He made two rings...

22:05.400 --> 22:09.598
..and engraved half the information
on each of them.

22:11.480 --> 22:15.314
- And...that is one of the rings?
- Yes.

22:15.360 --> 22:17.396
(Chuckles)

22:17.440 --> 22:20.955
Who'd have thought it was sitting here
right underneath my very nose.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.834
So that's half the clue
that will lead us to...

22:24.880 --> 22:26.677
A super-size stash of bling.

22:26.720 --> 22:29.109
- Yes!
- If you believe the legend, yes.

22:29.160 --> 22:30.991
But I must warn you...

22:32.000 --> 22:34.230
..those who choose to pursue it...

22:35.240 --> 22:38.357
..have been driven
to the brink of madness...

22:40.040 --> 22:41.792
..and beyond.

22:46.120 --> 22:47.553
Good night, girls.

22:53.480 --> 22:56.153
- Treasure.
- All-girl moon mission.

22:56.200 --> 22:58.475
Malibu beach house!

22:58.520 --> 23:00.988
If you believe the legend.

23:01.040 --> 23:02.473
Of course we do.

23:13.600 --> 23:15.989
- Code red, code red!
- Oh, my gosh, intruders.

23:16.040 --> 23:17.871
- Action stations.
- I'll get my tongs.

23:18.480 --> 23:19.674
Well, come on.

23:19.720 --> 23:22.598
- ? I've waited for so long
- Let's go.

23:22.640 --> 23:25.996
? Put up with your shenanigans

23:26.040 --> 23:29.112
? I'm going to take you on

23:29.160 --> 23:32.516
? And you won't know the half of it

23:32.560 --> 23:35.518
? I'm gonna put you in your place

23:35.560 --> 23:38.677
? You've got the queen, I've got the ace

23:38.720 --> 23:41.996
? I'll light you up and smoke you down

23:42.040 --> 23:44.918
? And watch the rings go round and round

23:44.960 --> 23:47.997
? Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh

23:48.040 --> 23:53.068
? It's in whoa-o, whoa-o

23:53.120 --> 23:55.873
? Whoa-o, whoa-o

23:55.920 --> 23:57.399
? Whoa-o...

23:57.440 --> 23:59.078
(Both) Strength and honour.

24:00.560 --> 24:03.154
(Bell chimes)

24:03.200 --> 24:05.236
(Man) So, sitting comfortably,

24:05.280 --> 24:08.795
somewhere safe,
where you won't be disturbed,

24:10.080 --> 24:13.868
take a few moments
to get in touch with your breath.

24:13.920 --> 24:17.037
Breathe in...and out.

24:17.080 --> 24:18.479
And in.

24:41.400 --> 24:43.231
(Groans) Come on.

24:43.840 --> 24:44.955
(Groans)

24:45.000 --> 24:47.594
? Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh

24:48.800 --> 24:52.110
? It's in whoa-o, whoa-o

24:52.160 --> 24:55.197
? Whoa-o, whoa-o

24:55.240 --> 24:57.151
? Whoa-o...

25:02.000 --> 25:03.672
Hello, boys.

25:11.680 --> 25:14.558
? I'm gonna put you in your place

25:14.600 --> 25:17.717
? You've got the queen, I've got the ace

25:17.760 --> 25:20.797
? I'll light you up and smoke you down

25:20.840 --> 25:23.991
? And watch your world
come crashing down...

25:25.120 --> 25:26.519
Excuse me?

25:29.560 --> 25:33.678
I don't think we've been introduced.
My name is Camilla Fritton.

25:34.640 --> 25:37.871
My friends call me Millie.
What...should I call you?

25:38.360 --> 25:40.078
(Man yells)

25:43.080 --> 25:44.274
(Crash)

25:44.320 --> 25:47.357
- An ambulance, perhaps?
- (Laughs)

25:47.400 --> 25:51.996
OK, girls.
Wait till you see the whites of their eyes.

25:56.120 --> 25:58.998
(Girls humming)

26:12.840 --> 26:16.628
(All) ? We are the best

26:16.680 --> 26:21.310
? So screw the rest

26:21.360 --> 26:27.435
? We do as we damn well please

26:27.480 --> 26:30.711
? Until the end

26:30.760 --> 26:34.639
? St Trinian's

26:35.640 --> 26:42.512
? Defenders of anarchy...

26:49.560 --> 26:51.152
Wait for it.

27:00.800 --> 27:03.314
Load!

27:04.360 --> 27:06.396
Wait for it, wait for it.

27:07.600 --> 27:09.318
- Fire.
- Fire!

27:09.360 --> 27:12.670
- Second rank, fire.
- Fire!

27:12.720 --> 27:16.156
Third rank, fire.

27:16.200 --> 27:17.952
Yes!

27:18.000 --> 27:20.639
- Fourth rank, fire!
- Fire!

27:27.600 --> 27:29.079
Ever heard of the wall of sound?

27:32.040 --> 27:33.951
Well, you're about to run into it.

27:35.440 --> 27:39.149
- (Loud distorted chord)
- Ha!

27:42.960 --> 27:44.552
Ow!

27:46.240 --> 27:48.037
What are you doing?

27:51.720 --> 27:52.709
Oh!

27:55.320 --> 27:56.753
(Squeals) Fire!

28:03.760 --> 28:06.228
- Fire at will.
- (Clamour)

28:07.880 --> 28:12.670
? We are the best so screw the rest

28:14.200 --> 28:19.194
? We do as we damn well please

28:19.240 --> 28:22.198
? Until the end

28:22.240 --> 28:25.277
? St Trinian's

28:25.320 --> 28:31.589
? Defenders of anarchy ?

28:31.640 --> 28:35.679
(All) Losers! Losers! Losers!

28:37.640 --> 28:39.198
And don't come back!

28:39.240 --> 28:40.798
(Man) Ow!

28:40.840 --> 28:43.274
Did I miss a party or something?

28:43.680 --> 28:46.990
I don't think it's too serious.
Why don't you sit up?

28:48.000 --> 28:50.594
- Give that girl a pint of blood on me.
- Yes, Miss.

28:51.720 --> 28:52.835
Ah.

28:52.880 --> 28:55.599
- I tried my best, Miss.
- No, rest, dear soldier, rest.

28:55.640 --> 28:59.394
Brave, brave soldier.
You did St Trinian's proud.

29:00.880 --> 29:02.916
What's the news -
victory for the home team?

29:02.960 --> 29:05.520
Well, they won't be coming back again,
that's for sure.

29:05.560 --> 29:06.993
Oh, thank God.

29:07.040 --> 29:08.439
(Helicopter)

29:16.480 --> 29:17.549
(Screaming)

29:21.720 --> 29:23.199
Keep quiet and still!

29:23.240 --> 29:25.993
- (Girl screams)
- Don't move!

29:29.360 --> 29:30.839
Stay calm.

29:45.240 --> 29:51.110
Quite the entrance. Of course...
one could have used the front door.

29:51.160 --> 29:55.438
Yes, but it wouldn't have looked
nearly so cool. (Chuckles)

29:55.480 --> 29:59.712
- Who are you people?
- We're your worst nightmare.

29:59.760 --> 30:01.557
You're not the Bee Gees, Take That.

30:01.600 --> 30:04.592
Hope you don't mind me dropping in?

30:04.640 --> 30:06.119
- (Growls)
- (Screams)

30:06.160 --> 30:12.315
I've just come to collect on a debt
you Frittons have owed for... Ooh...

30:13.640 --> 30:16.791
..four hundred and twenty years or so.

30:16.840 --> 30:18.751
You're a Pomfrey?

30:19.600 --> 30:20.874
What's Pomfrey?

30:20.920 --> 30:23.195
Clever girl.

30:23.240 --> 30:25.390
Sir Piers Pomfrey, to be exact.

30:26.440 --> 30:30.353
You must be the ineffable Camilla.

30:30.400 --> 30:31.389
Well... (Laughs)

30:31.440 --> 30:33.158
Enchanté.

30:35.240 --> 30:39.392
Good heavens, surely you're not silly
enough to believe all that silly old legend,

30:39.440 --> 30:42.113
about the pirates and treasure
and all that bunkum?

30:42.160 --> 30:43.559
Of course not.

30:43.600 --> 30:45.477
(Gasps)

30:45.520 --> 30:47.476
Auntie.

30:47.520 --> 30:49.636
That's why we went to so much trouble.

30:49.680 --> 30:51.989
There you are, sir.

30:53.080 --> 30:55.071
And I will have it back.

30:55.120 --> 30:57.554
Now that I have a clue
to its whereabouts.

30:57.600 --> 30:59.989
Yes, well, half a clue, sir.

31:03.080 --> 31:05.514
- One word of advice, Miss Fritton...
- (Beeping)

31:05.560 --> 31:08.677
Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.

31:09.680 --> 31:12.638
They're great
but you never really switch off, do you?

31:13.720 --> 31:18.555
Bono. (Snorts)
Wants to go for beers, again. (Chuckles)

31:21.360 --> 31:25.672
Anyway, as I was saying,
I hope we don't meet again, Miss Fritton,

31:25.720 --> 31:27.790
for your sake.

31:27.840 --> 31:29.956
Place looks like a bombsite, by the way.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.958
You ladies really need to
keep up the housework.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.434
Bye-bye.

31:40.760 --> 31:42.318
I can't believe it.

31:42.360 --> 31:44.590
She's gonna talk.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.591
Girls...

31:56.640 --> 32:03.751
our home, our school...
our sanctuary, has been violated...

32:03.800 --> 32:05.950
and not in a good way.

32:07.440 --> 32:11.149
As you know, fighting is abhorred
here in St Trinian's.

32:11.200 --> 32:15.432
But in this case...I say to you...

32:15.480 --> 32:17.914
they started it!

32:18.880 --> 32:21.110
But, Miss, what are we gonna do?
We ain't got the ring.

32:21.160 --> 32:26.154
Ah, yes. But remember the legend,
Jessica. There are two rings.

32:28.080 --> 32:30.548
To stop these bullies,

32:30.600 --> 32:35.196
all we have to do
is find the second ring first.

32:35.240 --> 32:37.117
But what about the first ring?

32:37.160 --> 32:39.469
I'll get to the first ring in a second,
Now, girls,

32:39.520 --> 32:42.637
we find the second ring first,

32:42.680 --> 32:45.274
we infiltrate the enemy camp,

32:45.320 --> 32:47.709
and get the first ring...second.

32:47.760 --> 32:49.671
Huh?

32:50.680 --> 32:54.195
Now... They may be many,

32:54.240 --> 32:55.992
and we may be few,

32:56.040 --> 32:59.271
but anyone who stands beside me
in this struggle,

32:59.320 --> 33:01.709
what can I say?

33:02.880 --> 33:04.677
We few...

33:05.920 --> 33:08.115
we happy few,

33:08.160 --> 33:10.390
we band of sisters.

33:11.400 --> 33:15.712
For she who sheds her blood with me
shall be my sister,

33:15.760 --> 33:19.958
were she ne'er so vile.
And gentle girls in England now abed,

33:20.000 --> 33:22.878
shall think themselves accursed
they were not here,

33:22.920 --> 33:28.199
and hold their girlhood cheap
whilst any speaks...

33:30.000 --> 33:31.797
..who fought with us...

33:33.200 --> 33:35.191
Oh, yeah.

33:40.320 --> 33:42.834
..upon St Trinian's Day.

33:43.840 --> 33:45.558
(All cheer)

33:53.600 --> 33:58.071
So... I'm going treasure hunting.
Who's with me?

33:58.120 --> 33:59.917
(All cheer)

34:10.719 --> 34:14.599
Kinsmen, welcome.
Let us pledge our troth.

34:15.639 --> 34:18.518
To preserve the natural order,

34:18.560 --> 34:23.475
menfolk as master, women as cattle
under yoke and chain.

34:23.520 --> 34:26.592
She under he for eternity.

34:27.600 --> 34:31.309
I hereby convene this,
the 612th congregation

34:31.360 --> 34:32.998
of our hallowed brotherhood.

34:50.040 --> 34:51.632
How are we all?

34:51.679 --> 34:53.795
- Very well.
- A lot better now we got the ring back.

34:53.840 --> 34:54.875
Hmm. Hear, hear.

34:54.920 --> 34:57.992
He's a wealthy philanthropist.
A real mover and a shaker.

34:58.040 --> 35:01.953
Yeah.
Everybody seems to love him.

35:02.000 --> 35:05.310
- He must be loaded.
- I can't find anything negative on him.

35:05.360 --> 35:10.673
Don't be fooled by appearances, girls.
Now, keep looking. Keep looking.

35:10.720 --> 35:12.711
OK, let's widen the net, girls.

35:16.360 --> 35:19.272
Look for anything
mentioning Pirate Fritton.

35:20.080 --> 35:23.629
- That looks interesting.
- What's that?

35:24.560 --> 35:27.120
Girls, hey, look,
I've got something.

35:27.160 --> 35:32.757
It is...recorded that the pis...

35:32.800 --> 35:34.870
..pis...

35:35.200 --> 35:37.077
..pis...

35:37.120 --> 35:41.910
It's recorded that the pistol-toting
Pirate Fritton left a treasure trail.

35:44.160 --> 35:46.435
It started with a series of playing cards.

35:46.480 --> 35:49.392
- Here they are.
- On each was written a clue.

35:49.440 --> 35:51.271
Look! Look here.

35:51.320 --> 35:58.635
"On the day of our Lord, May 22nd, 1882,
l, the Reverend Fortnum Fritton..."

35:58.680 --> 36:00.875
(Fritton)..after generations failed
before me,

36:00.920 --> 36:03.798
I finally found the first ring.

36:07.400 --> 36:11.393
And along with it,
the means of finding the second.

36:11.440 --> 36:13.317
What? What did he find?

36:13.360 --> 36:14.509
A widdle.

36:14.560 --> 36:16.357
A widdle?

36:16.400 --> 36:19.551
A weally old widdle,
left by Piwate Fwitton himthelf.

36:19.600 --> 36:23.115
- (All) Eugh!
- Oh, oh, oh. A riddle.

36:23.160 --> 36:24.275
Oh.

36:24.320 --> 36:25.833
That'th what I thaid, thilly.

36:25.880 --> 36:27.677
So where's the widdle now?

36:27.720 --> 36:29.517
- It's a riddle.
- Oh.

36:29.560 --> 36:31.596
- We found thith.
- Fortnum's will.

36:32.720 --> 36:36.395
"And I shall leave a trace of it
but not upon this earth."

36:36.440 --> 36:40.353
Not on earth? So it's what,
like in space or something?

36:42.240 --> 36:44.834
Not upon the earth, but under it.

36:44.880 --> 36:46.996
Thix feet under, perhapth?

36:47.040 --> 36:49.918
(All) Thix feet under.

36:49.960 --> 36:51.837
Don't take the pith.

37:03.960 --> 37:05.712
Look, I can't believe, right,

37:05.760 --> 37:09.958
that we're gonna dig up some rank dead
geezer on the off-chance he's got a clue.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.592
This is so creepy.

37:11.640 --> 37:14.359
We are actually walking over
dead bodies right now.

37:14.400 --> 37:17.597
There's no reason to be scared of death,

37:17.640 --> 37:21.076
cos death's just like, you know, life,

37:21.120 --> 37:22.678
but with all the crap bits taken out -

37:22.720 --> 37:26.315
Iike poverty and fascism,

37:26.360 --> 37:28.430
and Miley Cyrus.

37:28.480 --> 37:30.596
So, you wouldn't mind if you died?

37:30.640 --> 37:33.313
- I wouldn't mind if you died.
- There, look.

37:36.160 --> 37:38.390
He's got powerful friends.

37:40.440 --> 37:42.192
Ah, isn't she marvellous?

37:45.720 --> 37:48.393
I wouldn't mind getting my teeth
around Barack Obama.

37:48.440 --> 37:50.032
And, um...

37:50.800 --> 37:53.394
..here's somebody you might know.

37:53.440 --> 37:55.590
He may be our route to Pomfrey.

37:57.560 --> 38:02.588
- ? Love is a many-splendoured... ?
- Geoffrey.

38:02.640 --> 38:05.359
- Maybe you should give him a call.
- (Gasps)

38:05.400 --> 38:06.833
Call him?

38:09.160 --> 38:11.754
I'd rather cover myself in jam
and sit on a wasps' nest.

38:11.800 --> 38:14.030
But he might be our only hope.

38:14.080 --> 38:15.638
- Oh!
- (Gasps)

38:15.680 --> 38:17.272
Never!

38:25.200 --> 38:26.918
You ever been in love, Steve?

38:26.960 --> 38:29.554
- Oh, God.
- Don't bother.

38:29.600 --> 38:30.999
Take my advice...

38:31.040 --> 38:34.510
- Stay away from women?
- Stay away from women.

38:34.560 --> 38:36.869
Look, you gotta forget about her, Geoff.

38:36.920 --> 38:39.639
- Move on. Please!
- How is it possible?

38:39.680 --> 38:44.356
Behind the toothy smile and the...
baby blue eyes and the tweed suits,

38:44.400 --> 38:49.520
and the Wellington boots, there beats
a heart that is callous and self-serving?

38:49.560 --> 38:53.030
- I think you'll find they're brown, actually.
- Steve, they're blue.

38:53.080 --> 38:55.799
They are most definitely brown,
Geoffrey.

39:00.680 --> 39:02.079
Excuse me if I don't get up.

39:02.120 --> 39:04.156
- Won't be the first time.
- (Laughs)

39:08.240 --> 39:10.151
- What do you want?
- I want to know...

39:10.200 --> 39:13.636
about your little friend, Sir Piers Pomfrey.

39:16.480 --> 39:17.879
Pomfrey?

39:18.880 --> 39:22.555
Asked you out on a date, has he? I hope
he knows what he's letting himself in for.

39:22.600 --> 39:25.751
Couple of athletic sleepovers
and a bout of ritual humiliation.

39:25.800 --> 39:28.360
Got your private parts out
in a national newspaper. So what?

39:28.400 --> 39:32.996
Yeah, the pair of you, made for each other.
Marriage made in hell. Not that I care.

39:33.040 --> 39:37.238
I don't want to get into his pants.
I just want to get even.

39:39.280 --> 39:42.192
Double Baileys on the rocks, please.
Touch of lime juice.

39:42.240 --> 39:44.800
Are we, er, gonna be here long?

39:44.840 --> 39:46.876
Er, why, you got somewhere to be?

39:46.920 --> 39:52.995
Oh, I just... I'm cold and wet and bored.

39:54.120 --> 39:55.633
She's scared.

39:57.920 --> 40:01.595
You're scared!

40:01.640 --> 40:03.312
No.

40:03.360 --> 40:07.717
I do this kind of stuff all the time.
So, whatever.

40:07.760 --> 40:11.036
You know, I'm just chilling. Chill-axing.

40:11.080 --> 40:13.435
- (Screams)
- (All scream)

40:17.200 --> 40:19.509
My nails!

40:20.680 --> 40:22.910
I had just had them done.

40:22.960 --> 40:25.793
(Sighs) I nearly trumped in my trackies.

40:25.840 --> 40:27.671
(Sighs)

40:27.720 --> 40:30.109
He's dangerous, Camilla.

40:30.160 --> 40:32.720
Orchestrated my downfall -

40:32.760 --> 40:36.116
Pomfrey and his secret society.

40:37.080 --> 40:38.479
Secret society?

40:38.520 --> 40:40.954
AD1.

40:42.600 --> 40:45.592
They've got members
in every crook and nanny.

40:46.640 --> 40:51.919
Government...
army...police force.

40:51.960 --> 40:55.999
- I see.
- What's the plot, Fritton?

40:56.040 --> 40:59.794
I mean, you're not thinking of going up
against him, are you?

41:01.960 --> 41:04.269
Oh, my God, you are!

41:04.320 --> 41:07.392
They've taken something from me
that I intend to get back.

41:09.560 --> 41:10.959
Millie...

41:12.080 --> 41:13.718
-..count me in.
- Oh, Geoffrey.

41:17.280 --> 41:18.679
(Sighs)

41:19.160 --> 41:20.479
Oh...

41:21.480 --> 41:23.391
..Geoffrey.

41:25.400 --> 41:26.628
- (Belches)
- (Groans)

41:28.680 --> 41:33.515
You're a drunk, a sot,
a pale and pickled wreck of a man.

41:33.560 --> 41:36.791
If you were a horse,
they'd shoot you. God!

41:39.560 --> 41:41.391
Hold it right there, young lady.

41:42.400 --> 41:49.397
I may be...drunk and I may be a sot...
and I may be a pickled...horse...

41:50.440 --> 41:53.477
..but there's one thing I know
about secret societies...

41:56.640 --> 41:59.791
They're very secretive.
You don't know who they are.

41:59.840 --> 42:03.594
You don't know where they are.
You don't know anything about them

42:03.640 --> 42:07.792
unless you're a member or...
unless, of course...

42:11.000 --> 42:14.151
- You were one yourself.
- Mm.

42:17.680 --> 42:18.829
(Groans)

42:18.880 --> 42:20.791
(Coughs)

42:22.680 --> 42:24.193
(Groans)

42:24.240 --> 42:27.550
- (Both) Gross.
- Oh, I think it's kind of beautiful.

42:30.040 --> 42:33.077
Look, there's something stuck
under his hat.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.399
Ohh!

42:42.040 --> 42:44.759
"This ring will fit no finger,

42:44.800 --> 42:47.189
"but works upon the ear.

42:48.440 --> 42:49.919
"Ala..."

42:51.840 --> 42:55.196
I can't make out the final lines.
They've rotted away.

42:55.240 --> 42:56.559
Ah-ah-ah.

42:57.680 --> 42:59.033
Ah-ah-ah.

42:59.640 --> 43:00.629
Ah-ah-ah.

43:00.680 --> 43:03.035
Ah-ah-ah. Ah-ah-ah.

43:03.080 --> 43:05.640
Just like the spirit.
It's like that bit in Ghost.

43:05.680 --> 43:07.875
- Ahh.
- Bianca,

43:07.920 --> 43:09.592
can you hear us?

43:09.640 --> 43:11.995
- Atchoo!
- Ohh!

43:12.040 --> 43:14.235
Yeah, course I can.

43:14.280 --> 43:15.554
You tit.

43:15.600 --> 43:17.318
We thought you were possessed.

43:17.360 --> 43:20.033
Well, that would make you the tit, then,
wouldn't it, you tit?

43:20.080 --> 43:22.753
Don't call her a tit.
She's not the one who dragged us here.

43:22.800 --> 43:29.319
- Desist, you vile creatures!
- Take a chill pill, Annabelle.

43:29.360 --> 43:32.750
I am not Annabelle!

43:32.800 --> 43:37.715
Oh, yeah. We nearly almost forgot.
You're Head Girl. Yeah?

43:37.760 --> 43:39.591
Big whoop.

43:39.640 --> 43:42.712
(Creaking)

43:42.760 --> 43:43.829
(Growls)

43:43.880 --> 43:46.633
- (Screams)
- (All scream)

43:46.680 --> 43:49.353
(Growls and laughs)

43:49.400 --> 43:50.992
The fact of the matter is

43:51.040 --> 43:53.395
that people have been living in fear
of that man for far too long,

43:53.440 --> 43:56.876
and I can tell you something, Millie -
I am not afraid any more!

43:56.920 --> 43:59.150
- (Growls)
- Christ!

43:59.200 --> 44:00.792
- Morning, girls.
- Morning, Miss.

44:00.840 --> 44:03.434
I can't wait to give him
a dose of his own medicine,

44:03.480 --> 44:06.313
and watch the pompous prig shrivel
like a slug in salt.

44:06.360 --> 44:08.749
We have to act now,
strike while the iron's hot.

44:08.800 --> 44:11.598
Revenge is a dish best served cold,
Geoffrey.

44:13.680 --> 44:15.591
Welcome to recovery, Mr Thwaites.

44:15.640 --> 44:18.438
And you need to cool down.

44:29.320 --> 44:32.039
We have plans for you, Geoffrey.

44:32.080 --> 44:35.117
I'm just taking every day as it comes,

44:35.160 --> 44:38.232
and each day gets better and brighter.

44:38.280 --> 44:40.430
So, my name is Georgiana,

44:40.480 --> 44:45.474
and I'm proud to be able to say
that I haven't had a drink for six years now.

44:45.520 --> 44:48.114
- Oh!
- (Applause)

44:48.160 --> 44:50.151
Well done, Georgiana.

44:50.200 --> 44:53.556
And now I'd like you all to welcome
our newest member.

44:53.600 --> 44:56.194
Geoffrey. Mr Thwaites.

44:56.240 --> 44:59.118
How lovely to see you here,

44:59.160 --> 45:02.197
with me, us, in this room.

45:07.120 --> 45:08.792
Right.

45:08.840 --> 45:10.592
Well, l, I'm Geoffrey and...

45:10.640 --> 45:13.234
- (All) Hello, Geoffrey.
- Um...

45:13.280 --> 45:15.919
Well, I think this is all, all very admirable,

45:15.960 --> 45:19.270
but I'm afraid you're rather wasting
your time. You see, I'm not an alcoholic.

45:19.320 --> 45:22.198
I, um, I like a drink.

45:22.240 --> 45:24.276
And who doesn't?

45:24.320 --> 45:28.393
A nice brandy after dinner.
Couple of whiskies after a round of golf.

45:29.600 --> 45:31.352
A sharpener before lunch.

45:33.200 --> 45:35.316
Glass of tequila with breakfast.

45:37.480 --> 45:38.549
What?

45:40.880 --> 45:43.110
What on earth's the matter with Annabelle?

45:43.160 --> 45:47.517
It's kinda hard to say, Miss.
She's not herself.

45:47.560 --> 45:50.870
Yeah, I must say, she's been taking
this Head Girl thing a bit too seriously.

45:50.920 --> 45:56.677
No. No, no, no, it's not that.
Believe, she is really not herself.

45:56.720 --> 45:58.358
- (Growling)
- What on earth?

45:58.400 --> 45:59.913
Where is she?

46:02.240 --> 46:06.153
(Gasps) Annabelle,
you come down here immediately.

46:06.200 --> 46:09.749
I am not Annabelle.
I am Fortnum Fritton.

46:09.800 --> 46:13.793
Scourge of the Bavarian hoof markets.
Terror of the Western lsles.

46:13.840 --> 46:17.594
And I am Camilla Fritton, Headmistress
of St Trinian's School For Young Ladies.

46:17.640 --> 46:19.312
So pull yourself together.

46:19.360 --> 46:23.353
Possessing one's own relatives is not the
sort of thing we encourage at this school.

46:23.400 --> 46:25.470
- (Gasps) Oh!
- (Laughs)

46:25.520 --> 46:27.988
Really, Fortnum,
that is neither clever nor funny.

46:28.040 --> 46:30.110
Now tell me, where is the treasure?

46:30.160 --> 46:33.869
At last, my beautiful treasure.

46:33.920 --> 46:35.478
I'm rich. (Laughs)

46:35.520 --> 46:37.351
She's gone Dolce and bananas.

46:38.760 --> 46:42.070
I think we need to exorcise her.

46:42.120 --> 46:44.111
Yeah, she could definitely do
with toning up.

46:44.160 --> 46:48.358
- Not exercise, genius, exorcise.
- Yes.

46:48.400 --> 46:50.960
I heard that.

46:51.000 --> 46:53.594
I cast you out, unclean spirit!

46:53.640 --> 46:56.871
The rest of the clue, Fortnum, right now,
or you'll be in big trouble.

46:56.920 --> 47:00.913
(Chants) There's no place like home, um.

47:00.960 --> 47:03.269
(Groans)

47:03.320 --> 47:06.756
- (Shouts) Get thee behind me, Satan.
- Yes, get, get behind her.

47:06.800 --> 47:09.189
- Yeah, what she said.
- (Groans)

47:10.600 --> 47:13.319
This ring will fit no finger,

47:13.360 --> 47:15.396
but works upon the ear.

47:15.440 --> 47:18.034
Awash with hopes,

47:18.080 --> 47:20.389
I learned the ropes.

47:20.440 --> 47:23.079
You'll find my mast is here.

47:23.120 --> 47:25.315
Mast is here?

47:33.000 --> 47:35.116
Try this way.

47:37.440 --> 47:38.839
Hi.

47:39.680 --> 47:41.511
How's it going?

47:41.560 --> 47:47.078
I don't need to! All right, losers,
have you solved it yet or what?

47:47.120 --> 47:48.997
(All gasp)

47:49.040 --> 47:52.271
Ooh, bit touchy today.
D'you want me to give it a go?

47:52.320 --> 47:54.470
As if, Bianca.

47:55.120 --> 47:57.634
I...think I should have a go.

47:57.680 --> 48:00.831
Girls, we have run it through
three super-computers,

48:00.880 --> 48:02.632
converted it into numerical equations,

48:02.680 --> 48:07.515
anagrammatised it and translated it
into 38 different languages.

48:07.560 --> 48:11.075
Do you really think that either of you two
are going to crack it?

48:11.120 --> 48:13.190
(Both) Might.

48:13.240 --> 48:15.435
(Sighs) Be my guest.

48:15.480 --> 48:17.198
(Bianca clears her throat)

48:19.320 --> 48:22.835
This ring will fit no finger
But works upon the ear

48:22.880 --> 48:26.714
Awash with hopes I learned the ropes
You'll find my mast is here

48:26.760 --> 48:31.880
Find my masters here.
Well, where were his masters?

48:32.880 --> 48:36.953
His schoolmasters?
Was it in a school?

48:37.000 --> 48:40.629
My mast is here. Like on a boat.

48:40.680 --> 48:44.559
Yeah, yeah. Like on a boat, you div.
What, can't you hear proper?

48:44.600 --> 48:46.113
Can't you speak proper?

48:46.160 --> 48:47.559
- Oi, right?
- Yeah, what?

48:47.600 --> 48:48.919
What are you gonna do?

48:48.960 --> 48:51.952
- No, what, right. These are coming out.
- Hang on. Hang on!

48:52.000 --> 48:53.831
- She's right.
- Huh?

48:53.880 --> 48:56.314
His school. That's a homophone.

48:56.360 --> 48:59.193
A homophone is a phrase
that sounds the same,

48:59.240 --> 49:02.676
but has two different meanings.
Like a pun.

49:02.720 --> 49:04.073
Yeah, I knew that.

49:04.120 --> 49:06.680
So, it is a school.

49:06.720 --> 49:09.712
I was right, it...
it's Fritton's school!

49:09.760 --> 49:11.591
We, we cracked it. We cracked it.

49:11.640 --> 49:16.111
Get in! Suck on that, Lucy.
Yeah? Yeah?

49:16.160 --> 49:18.674
- In your face. In your face.
- Suck on that, Lucy.

49:18.720 --> 49:23.236
- Oh, in, in, in your face.
- ln, in your face.

49:23.280 --> 49:25.350
- Oh, in your face.
- Your face.

49:46.080 --> 49:47.991
? Heaven loves ya

49:49.640 --> 49:51.358
? The clouds part for ya

49:52.600 --> 49:55.160
? Nothing stands in your way

49:55.200 --> 49:57.031
? When you're a boy

50:01.000 --> 50:02.877
? Clothes always fit ya

50:03.880 --> 50:06.394
? Life is a pop of the cherry

50:06.440 --> 50:09.000
? When you're a boy

50:10.400 --> 50:12.436
? When you're a boy

50:12.480 --> 50:14.198
? You can wear uniforms

50:14.240 --> 50:16.356
? When you're a boy

50:16.400 --> 50:17.958
? Other boys check you out

50:18.000 --> 50:19.194
? You get a girl... ?

50:19.240 --> 50:23.279
Whoa! This place is, like, ginormous.

50:23.320 --> 50:27.154
How are we supposed to find
a tiny little ring in such a big space?

50:27.200 --> 50:29.077
Come on, brainiacs.
Any bright ideas?

50:29.120 --> 50:34.194
I was thinking...
where are all the fit boys?

50:34.240 --> 50:37.152
I mean, you promised us hunky men.

50:37.200 --> 50:39.919
And these guys,
they're just a bunch of pansies.

50:39.960 --> 50:43.589
Oh, apart from that one.
Look at him. He's gorge!

50:43.640 --> 50:46.074
Saffy, that's Bella.

50:46.120 --> 50:49.829
- (Saffy) Oh.
- Oh. Bye.

50:51.280 --> 50:52.952
I got his number!

50:53.000 --> 50:54.956
What do you boys
think you're doing here?

50:55.000 --> 50:56.194
Who are you?

50:58.080 --> 50:59.672
I'm...

50:59.720 --> 51:03.793
(Deep voice)
I'm...Jonty. Jonty Barbour.

51:06.080 --> 51:09.550
This is...Bufty Rolls-Royce
and...Sebastian de Billiard.

51:10.360 --> 51:12.828
(Deep voice)
We're friends of Wills and Harry.

51:12.880 --> 51:15.838
You know Wills and Harry.
Course you do. Great guys.

51:15.880 --> 51:17.916
- Yeah, great guys.
- (Bella) Top lads.

51:17.960 --> 51:19.234
Top, top!

51:25.200 --> 51:26.349
I ski.

51:26.400 --> 51:27.913
(School bell rings)

51:27.960 --> 51:30.190
Bugger! I've got double maths.

51:30.240 --> 51:32.674
But we'll resume this later.

51:33.600 --> 51:34.635
(Girls sigh)

51:34.680 --> 51:36.511
Saved by the bell, hey, girls?

51:36.560 --> 51:37.709
(Saffy chuckles)

51:37.760 --> 51:40.672
- That was brilliant!
- (Bianca) What was brilliant?

51:40.720 --> 51:42.597
The bell. Bell.

51:44.640 --> 51:46.471
Saved by the bell!

51:47.320 --> 51:51.359
"This ring will fit no finger
but works upon the ear."

51:51.400 --> 51:53.470
The ring of the bell. Genius!

51:57.200 --> 51:58.519
(Lucy) Yes!

51:58.560 --> 51:59.834
It's a clue.

51:59.880 --> 52:01.472
(Lucy) Oh, wow!

52:01.520 --> 52:03.795
"Your final search from ear to ear.

52:03.840 --> 52:05.637
"An old head lies between.

52:05.680 --> 52:08.114
"Stride southwest
from there to here.

52:08.160 --> 52:09.752
"Now take your first 1 6."

52:13.000 --> 52:14.558
1 6!

52:14.600 --> 52:16.397
"Now southeast in unbroken line.

52:16.440 --> 52:19.512
"Count 100 twice...and 39."

52:19.560 --> 52:21.676
Southeast.

52:21.720 --> 52:23.995
(Choir sings)

52:25.160 --> 52:27.230
(Chelsea) Ah! Brilliant!

52:27.280 --> 52:29.430
How are we supposed to get past them?

52:29.480 --> 52:34.349
Oh, chill out, Bride of Chucky! Yeah?

52:34.400 --> 52:36.231
They're a choir of boys.

52:37.560 --> 52:41.235
Leave this one to me. Oi!

52:41.280 --> 52:44.511
Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi!

52:44.560 --> 52:47.791
I'm not being funny, yeah.
Are you lot serious?

52:47.840 --> 52:50.991
You lot sound
like a bunch of little girlies!

52:51.040 --> 52:54.510
Right, what you need
is a remix, yeah?

52:54.560 --> 52:57.438
So, like... Come closer. Come closer.

52:57.480 --> 53:00.358
Right, so listen
to some of my beats, yeah?

53:00.400 --> 53:01.674
Like...

53:01.720 --> 53:03.711
(Bianca beatboxes)

53:05.480 --> 53:06.879
Freaky, freaky!

53:06.920 --> 53:08.911
(Beatboxes)

53:08.960 --> 53:10.951
Yeah? And then some like...

53:11.000 --> 53:12.194
(Scratches)

53:12.240 --> 53:17.155
(Heavy breathing)

53:20.960 --> 53:22.029
(Screams)

53:22.960 --> 53:26.270
(Camilla) Good work, Julie. Thank you.
(Julie) Pleasure, Miss.

53:26.320 --> 53:30.632
Sunday afternoon voodoo class
seems to be really paying off.

53:32.120 --> 53:33.348
(Whimpers)

53:33.400 --> 53:35.960
Kelly wouldn't have got us
into this mess.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.036
Kelly wouldn't have got possessed.

53:38.080 --> 53:40.150
(Camilla) My dear child, listen to you.

53:40.200 --> 53:43.158
You need to stop trying to be
Kelly Jones and start trying to be...

53:44.120 --> 53:45.712
Annabelle Fritton!

53:45.760 --> 53:47.273
No! Look at the state of you.

53:47.320 --> 53:48.594
(Groans)

53:48.640 --> 53:50.995
That's not a hairdo.
That's a hair-don't!

53:51.040 --> 53:53.873
Oh, for God's sake,
face up before I have a prolapse!

53:53.920 --> 53:58.710
235, 236, 237, 238, 239...

54:00.920 --> 54:02.433
- Bother.
- Go on!

54:05.200 --> 54:08.272
OK, guys, be quick because
break starts any minute, yeah?

54:11.760 --> 54:14.558
(Lucy) Look what he's wearing.

54:14.600 --> 54:17.353
Ah, so now you're
the style queen, are you?

54:17.400 --> 54:20.233
Yeah, we're looking for a ring,
not fashion tips.

54:20.280 --> 54:22.669
But he's wearing a ring.
An earring, anyway.

54:22.720 --> 54:25.314
(Chelsea) Yeah. In a painting.

54:30.840 --> 54:34.355
Headmaster, do we have a boy
called Bufty Rolls-Royce?

54:35.920 --> 54:39.037
Uh...guys, the headmaster
is, like, kinda coming this way.

54:41.200 --> 54:44.510
(Roxy) Forget it.
We gotta go. The window!

54:45.560 --> 54:46.879
(Clears throat)

54:48.880 --> 54:51.235
(Gasps) Girls!

54:53.400 --> 54:57.473
"Your final search from ear to ear"!

54:57.520 --> 55:01.559
"An old headmaster lies between."

55:01.600 --> 55:03.397
(Teacher) Headmaster.

55:04.960 --> 55:06.473
Uh...I'm so sorry, sir.

55:06.520 --> 55:08.033
What are you doing, you clumsy boy?!

55:08.080 --> 55:11.117
- It is the earring.
- Ha!

55:11.160 --> 55:15.199
In your face! In your face!

55:16.440 --> 55:19.000
Face of a supermodel.
Brain of a supernoodle.

55:19.040 --> 55:20.473
Lucy!

55:21.400 --> 55:24.073
Do you really think
I look like a supermodel?

55:24.120 --> 55:25.519
(Roxy groans)

55:25.560 --> 55:27.994
(Saffy) You do! You really do!

55:34.880 --> 55:36.199
What the...?

55:37.240 --> 55:38.229
(Roxy groans)

55:38.280 --> 55:39.269
Boys?

55:41.480 --> 55:44.552
Boys! Boys!

55:44.600 --> 55:46.192
Boys, come here at once!

55:47.240 --> 55:49.231
(Choir beatboxes)

56:03.840 --> 56:05.751
Come on, come on!

56:05.800 --> 56:06.994
Later!

56:07.040 --> 56:09.076
Wait! Stop them!

56:13.080 --> 56:15.514
(Choir beatboxes)

56:16.360 --> 56:17.952
Come on, boys!

56:31.680 --> 56:33.955
(Girls cheer)

56:38.560 --> 56:40.710
(Lucy) Come on!

56:45.480 --> 56:46.993
Bugger!

56:47.400 --> 56:48.435
(Chelsea sighs)

56:48.480 --> 56:49.833
Got it!

56:49.880 --> 56:50.995
(Girls cheer)

56:52.000 --> 56:53.956
(Zoe) Are we all in?
(Roxy) Yeah.

56:57.360 --> 56:58.998
(Chelsea) 51...
(Lucy) Degrees.

56:59.040 --> 57:00.678
(Chelsea) 30...
(Lucy) Minutes.

57:00.720 --> 57:03.393
- (Bianca) 24...
- Seconds. It's latitude.

57:03.440 --> 57:06.796
Which means the treasure
has to be here.

57:06.840 --> 57:07.829
(Chelsea squeals)

57:07.880 --> 57:09.632
Or here.

57:09.680 --> 57:11.796
Or here. Or here.

57:11.840 --> 57:14.308
Anywhere, in fact, along this line.

57:14.360 --> 57:16.999
We need the longitude.

57:17.040 --> 57:18.189
We need the other ring.

57:18.240 --> 57:22.756
Yes, wicked! Let's break into AD1
and swipe it back, yeah?

57:22.800 --> 57:24.358
Oh, tick-tock.

57:24.400 --> 57:26.675
Who's gonna get us inside?
You and your chav army?

57:26.720 --> 57:30.554
Uh...we're rude girls.
Rude girls. Rude girls. Girls.

57:30.600 --> 57:31.828
Chavs, chavs, chavs...

57:31.880 --> 57:35.111
Whatever! Don't you think this idea
is just a wee bit unfeasible?

57:35.160 --> 57:38.675
- Roxy, this is St Trinian's.
- Annabelle.

57:38.720 --> 57:40.790
We don't know
the meaning of unfeasible.

57:40.840 --> 57:42.239
That's true.

57:42.280 --> 57:46.432
Besides, we've got our way inside.
We've got our inside man.

57:48.440 --> 57:51.273
I must say, you do scrub up
rather well, Geoffrey.

57:51.320 --> 57:53.834
And I know I have you
and the girls to thank for it.

57:55.320 --> 57:57.754
There's something
I want to give you, Camilla.

57:57.800 --> 57:58.789
Oh!

57:59.560 --> 58:00.993
(Camilla chuckles)

58:02.720 --> 58:04.711
Oh, look!

58:04.760 --> 58:07.558
Oh, no, he's simply divine!

58:07.600 --> 58:10.319
He's so lovely and so licky!

58:10.360 --> 58:15.434
I bet if he could talk he'd be trying
to tell me just how much he loves me.

58:16.640 --> 58:20.679
Oh, Geoffrey!
I shall call him...Heathcliff.

58:24.680 --> 58:28.036
Well, I need to tell you something
but l...I don't know how.

58:28.080 --> 58:30.355
Oh, just use your lips, Geoffrey.

58:31.440 --> 58:34.477
AD1 are a bunch
of women-hating psychopaths.

58:36.080 --> 58:37.911
They're not just any old secret society.

58:37.960 --> 58:40.235
They were formed 500 years ago
with one aim in mind -

58:40.280 --> 58:42.316
the repression
and the subjugation of women.

58:42.360 --> 58:45.318
And you were a member.
Oh, Geoffrey, how could you?

58:45.360 --> 58:47.351
I was...young. I was ambitious.

58:47.400 --> 58:50.233
I needed all the help I could get
to climb the greasy pole.

58:50.280 --> 58:52.157
Look where it got you.

58:52.200 --> 58:54.430
- I've changed, Camilla.
- Oh.

58:55.920 --> 58:57.797
The girls are waiting to debrief you.

58:59.600 --> 59:01.431
We'll see how much you've changed.

59:03.920 --> 59:05.956
(Heathcliff pants)

59:07.800 --> 59:08.835
Heathcliff!

59:14.000 --> 59:17.151
So I got the lowdown
from Geoffrey Thwaites.

59:17.200 --> 59:20.476
He can get us inside.
The safe is in the basement.

59:20.520 --> 59:24.149
And the ring is in the safe!
Let's get cracking!

59:24.200 --> 59:27.954
And what exactly do we know about
breaking into high-security vaults?

59:28.000 --> 59:31.151
Not much.
But I know a girl that does.

59:32.240 --> 59:34.117
All right, strangers?

59:35.040 --> 59:37.270
- Hey, Kelly!
- Kelly!

59:55.640 --> 59:57.631
(Men chant)

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:25.351
- (Thwaites) Ready?
- Ready.

01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:27.588
Ready.

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:30.193
Ready.

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:32.957
Ready.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.991
(Men chant)

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:45.712
(Whispers) Go on! Go on!

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:02.111
(Chanting)

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.991
(Thwaites chants)

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:18.917
Straight ahead, then turn right.
The vault should be in front of you.

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:21.190
But look out.
There's security everywhere.

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:23.393
Told you.

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:35.994
(Kelly) There she is.

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:40.388
- Bingo!
- (Whispers) Wait here.

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:50.629
Kinsmen!

01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:52.159
(Girls gasp)

01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:54.316
- What are you doing down here?
- Well...

01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:57.551
Are you wearing lipstick, kinsman?

01:01:57.600 --> 01:01:58.794
(Annabelle grunts)

01:01:58.840 --> 01:01:59.829
Who are you, anyway?

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:05.469
(Girls giggle)

01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:06.555
(Groans)

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:08.272
(Tania) Take that, hoodie.

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:14.078
(Lucy) Now tread carefully.

01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:16.918
The surveillance room
is directly on your right.

01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:22.952
(Kelly) Oi. Oi!

01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:37.159
It's party time.

01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:41.351
? My black eye casts no shadow

01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:43.789
? Your red eye sees nothing

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:45.478
? Your slap don't stick,
your kicks don't hit

01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:47.556
? So we remain the same

01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:49.636
? Love sticks, sweat drips

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:51.830
? Break the lock if it don't fit

01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:53.791
? A kick to the teeth is good for some

01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:55.831
? A kiss with a fist is better than none

01:02:58.160 --> 01:02:59.957
? Whoa

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.436
? A kiss with a fist is better than none ?

01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:06.595
Yes!

01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:10.117
(Girls chuckle)

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:13.232
(Tara and Tania)
Oi, geezer! What do you want?

01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:14.998
Wow!

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:16.549
(Both) Uh...

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:19.154
(Groans)

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:22.792
Vulcan death grip.

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:23.829
(Both) Cool!

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:25.354
Come on, girls.

01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:28.559
(Henchman groans)

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:30.875
Are you not in the least
concerned about the news

01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:34.356
that those schoolgirls
have discovered the second ring?

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:38.030
Am I concerned? No.

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:41.834
No, I'm not concerned.
Annoyed, certainly.

01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:46.351
Astonished at some of this country's
finest minds being outsmarted

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:50.393
by a bunch of pathetic,
empty-headed little women!

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:53.151
I'll give you three guesses.

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:55.919
Well, what are we going
to do about it, then, sir?

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:01.112
Kinsman?

01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:04.748
(Pomfrey) Well, isn't that
an excellent question?

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:08.679
I thought perhaps we might open
that question out to the floor.

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:13.037
(Man) I say we should send
the troops in again.

01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:17.232
(Parker) Let's not be too hasty.
We lost good men last time.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.592
(Door clicks open)

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:34.155
(Girl) What's that?

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:37.670
Freon. It's a freezing gas
to counteract the heat sensors.

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:04.790
Oh, wow!

01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:10.592
Terminated. Who are these people?

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:14.633
Oi.

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:16.636
Annabelle.

01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:17.669
(Girls gasp)

01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:18.709
Bingo!

01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:28.675
(Kelly) Bugger!

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:30.039
No!

01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:33.197
(Matron) Oh, no!

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:41.439
Girls, girls, abort mission.
Abort mission!

01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:43.309
Go, go, go!

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:45.430
(Lucy) Switch to Geoffrey cam.

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:48.232
It's all up to you, Geoffrey.

01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:50.599
Kinsman...

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:51.629
(Lucy) Uh-oh.

01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:54.558
We've heard nothing from you.
What's your proposal?

01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:55.999
(Gulps)

01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:57.553
Kinsman!

01:05:58.400 --> 01:05:59.389
What?

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:02.716
He's absolutely sloshed.
What's happened?

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:04.159
What's your take on these women?

01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:06.509
Women? (Blows raspberry)

01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:08.835
(Exhales)

01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:10.950
(Chuckles)

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:11.989
Hey.

01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:13.792
I'll tell you what, right...

01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:16.559
I'll tell...
Seriously, I've had enough of them.

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:20.238
I've... Sick to the hind bloody teeth
of the whole lot of them.

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:22.077
(Girls gasp)

01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:23.314
Scumbag!

01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:25.555
Yack, yack, yack in your ear
all day about...

01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:27.238
(Camilla) That's gratitude for you.

01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:28.269
Gratitude.

01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:29.594
After I rescued him
from the dung heap.

01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:30.755
Dung...

01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:33.149
Dung?

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:36.670
Bitching and moaning
about this and that and whatever.

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:38.950
It's time for them to shut up!

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.389
(Camilla)..you stupid little...

01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:44.193
Tell you what I realised,
right, about women

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:46.629
is that they're greedy, manipulative,

01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:50.832
cold-hearted, sadistic little...minxes.

01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:52.552
(Camilla scoffs)

01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:55.512
And I'm finished with them!
No mercy!

01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:59.109
No mercy! No mercy! No mercy!

01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:03.914
No mercy! No mercy!

01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:05.871
No mercy!

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:07.717
Thank you very much.

01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:11.476
- How dare he?
- Nasty piece of work!

01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:19.035
- (Pomfrey) I like what you said.
- I meant every word.

01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:20.559
About time someone said it straight.

01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:22.511
Women are
for making cakes and babies.

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:24.551
Good job, kinsman.

01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:27.872
I commend you.

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:29.239
Master.

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:30.872
Mission over.

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:32.558
(Chelsea sighs)

01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:37.118
That worked out well, didn't it?
Brilliant plan!

01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:38.752
I didn't exactly see you helping!

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:40.870
You must have been busy
doing sod-all yourself.

01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:42.148
Who's for a nice cup of...?

01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:44.668
Like whose idea was it to
break into an empty vault anyway?

01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:46.392
The geeks didn't do their homework.

01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:49.512
How were we supposed
to know the vault was empty?

01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:51.630
That's all we need, yeah?
Thick geeks!

01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:54.274
We would have been better off
asking Chelsea to do it!

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:56.072
(Chelsea gasps)

01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:57.997
(All shouting)

01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:03.114
(Both whistle)

01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:08.874
How can we expect to fight
an organisation like AD1

01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:10.638
if all we do is fight each other?

01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:12.875
This is not the time
to play the blame game!

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:15.036
(Camilla) Absolutely right, Annabelle.

01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:16.671
If it's anybody's fault,

01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:20.269
it's that double-crossing swine
Geoffrey Thwaites'.

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:25.752
Deep down I always knew
he was untrustworthy.

01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:29.395
But he sucks you in
with his rakish charm,

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:31.908
those eyes like limpid pools.

01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:33.439
That silky, tousled hair.

01:08:33.479 --> 01:08:36.392
- (Girls gasp)
- (Matron) That firm, downy chest.

01:08:36.439 --> 01:08:40.831
No! He's a traitor and a coward!
And if I see him again, so...

01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:42.073
(Heathcliff whines)

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:45.350
Oh. Geoffrey.

01:08:49.319 --> 01:08:51.310
(Lucy gasps)

01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:01.029
Oh.

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:03.629
The ring!

01:09:08.439 --> 01:09:13.560
Bursar, how much is 10,000 doubloons
worth in today's currency?

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:18.720
Oh...carry the one,
times by 12, carry the one,

01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:20.796
compound the rate of inflation.

01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:27.598
409,846,902 pounds and 18 pence.

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:29.470
Why?

01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:31.397
Because kerching!

01:09:31.439 --> 01:09:35.149
That's what we're going to collect,
you darling little number cruncher!

01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:37.509
Yes, if we find the ring.

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:40.631
- I mean, the other ring.
- Ah.

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:45.270
(Bursar gasps)

01:09:46.359 --> 01:09:48.475
My precious!

01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:50.511
(Groans)

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:56.356
Oh. Uh...

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:12.748
Latitude, 51 degrees,
30 minutes, 24 seconds.

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:16.998
Longitude, zero degrees,
five minutes, 35 seconds.

01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:22.152
(Lucy gasps)

01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:25.152
(Lucy) It's...it's in London.

01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:26.918
(Annabelle) X marks the spot.

01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:28.678
(Lucy) Right by the Thames.

01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:30.629
Girls...

01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:41.193
Oh. How about a visit to the theatre?

01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:43.231
(Mobile rings)

01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:44.713
Agent Jones.

01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:48.594
(Speaks Arabic)

01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:51.830
- Hey...
- I'll see you at the airport.

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:55.839
Hey. Listen, I've got to run
but you can take it from here.

01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:57.108
- Kel...
- You'll be fine.

01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:59.071
Your aunt might be
as mad as a bag of gerbils

01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:01.236
but she's a pretty smart
judge of character.

01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:04.514
Kelly...

01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:09.829
- What do you do now?
- Well...

01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:13.834
You heard of Ml5?

01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:15.598
Ml6?

01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:17.949
Well, that was Ml7.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.513
Good luck.

01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:28.032
? I'm not used to being the first pick

01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:31.390
? Like the cool chick
from the in clique

01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:34.637
? I have always gone my own way

01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:37.638
? I'm my own girl in my own world

01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:40.399
? Ooh, ooh

01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:45.195
? I'm gonna feel that feeling,
gonna lose control

01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:47.549
? Ooh, ooh

01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:52.310
? I'm gonna feel that feeling,
gonna lose control tonight

01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:00.672
- Are we nearly there yet?
- Not now, Bursar.

01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:05.874
? I'm gonna feel that feeling,
gonna lose control tonight ?

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:07.751
Peters!

01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:09.279
(Peters groans)

01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:14.515
Look at this.

01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:17.233
Oh, yes.
That's lovely, sir. Is that new?

01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:18.599
Look at it.

01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:20.553
Look at it!

01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:23.398
They swapped it.
They've got both rings.

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:25.749
I want them found.
I want them crushed.

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:27.199
I want them destroyed.

01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:28.434
Don't worry, sir.

01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:31.950
We have an extensive network of CCTV
and undercover operatives.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.070
They can't breathe
without us knowing about it.

01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:35.951
- So where are they?
- Huh?

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.992
- (Groans)
- Where are they now?

01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:41.474
Where are they...now?

01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:42.794
(Groans)

01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:46.196
Where are they? Um...

01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:48.356
(Radio) Subjects located. Platform three.

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:50.630
(Groans)

01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:53.114
Ah, little Miss Fritton.

01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:57.870
(PA) The next train to depart from
platform six will be the 16:28...

01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:01.709
Yes.

01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:07.394
Just stay calm, girls.
Swimming pool rules. No running.

01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:10.158
- No shoving.
- I have them.

01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:13.431
No heavy petting. We go when I say.

01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:15.357
- Take them.
- (Man) Roger that.

01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:18.517
Start to move in. Moving in now.

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:20.949
OK, Annabelle, let's do this. Now.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.436
A one, a two, a one, two, three, four.

01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:28.510
? See the people
walking down the street

01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:32.519
? Fall in line just watching on the feed

01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:34.551
? They don't know where they wanna go

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:36.670
? But they're walking in time

01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:41.791
? They got the beat,
they got the beat, they got the beat

01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:43.749
? Yeah, they got the beat

01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:46.758
(Pomfrey) What on earth is going on?
What are they doing?

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:49.758
I think it's called a flash mob, sir.

01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:52.030
(Jemima) Annabelle, time to go.

01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:54.071
? All the kids
just getting out of school

01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:56.111
? They can't wait
to hang out and be cool

01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:58.913
? Hang around till quarter after 12

01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:00.313
? That's when they fall in line

01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:01.952
Look out. They're onto you.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.355
? They got the beat,
they got the beat

01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:09.190
? Kids got the beat, yeah,
kids got the beat

01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:13.153
? Go-go music...

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:17.830
- Girls, be careful! Duck! Duck!
- ? Do the pony, puts us in a trance

01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:20.235
? Do the Watusi, just give us a chance

01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:23.033
OK, it's clear for the south exit.

01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:27.915
? Cos we've got the beat,
we got the beat, we got the beat

01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:29.996
? Yeah, we got it

01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:33.477
- ? We got the beat
- (Peters clears throat)

01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:35.192
(Pomfrey) Men, hold your positions.

01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:38.869
All exits are covered.
Repeat, all exits are covered.

01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:40.594
Go, go, go, go!

01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:41.993
? We got the beat

01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:44.031
? We know you can dance to the beat

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:45.069
? We got the beat

01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:46.394
? Jump in

01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:47.919
? Get down

01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:50.394
? Round and around and around

01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:52.032
? We got the beat

01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:54.998
? We got the beat

01:14:56.440 --> 01:14:57.873
? We got the beat

01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:01.031
? We got the beat

01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:03.799
? We got the beat

01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:06.915
? We got the beat

01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:09.997
? We got the beat ?

01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:17.590
- Follow them!
- (AD1 man) They're in groups.

01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:20.632
Which group are we supposed
to be following, sir?

01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:23.035
(Pomfrey mumbles)

01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:25.639
- All of them.
- All?

01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:27.079
- (Shouts) All of them!
- Yes.

01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:32.909
Big fish, little fish, cardboard box.

01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:34.996
Where are they?

01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:38.669
Big fish, little fish, cardboard box.
Feed the chickens! Feed the chickens!

01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:40.676
Milk the cow! Milk the cow!

01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:46.317
(Camilla) Oh, the girls!
The girls! They're here!

01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:48.191
Come on. Right on time.

01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:50.913
One, two, three, four, five, six.

01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:54.393
Come on!

01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:57.238
(Announcer) Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.

01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:01.273
The second half of Romeo And Juliet
will commence in three minutes.

01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:03.356
- Bursar, your helmet.
- Hmm?

01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:18.836
(Announcer)
Two minutes to curtain up, please.

01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:20.836
Cast, two minutes.

01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:23.877
What on earth
do you suppose induced

01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:26.992
that old sea dog Archibald Fritton
to hide his treasure here?

01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:33.557
(Lucy) Girls, over here!

01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:35.715
Help.

01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:39.913
(Girls) One, two, three.

01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:41.313
(Girls gasp)

01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:43.518
Hey...

01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:44.595
(Girls cough)

01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:46.153
You're not allowed back here.

01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:48.878
Says who?

01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:53.038
Uh...well, don't you know
who this is?

01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:57.312
Oh...my God! You're that guy
off the telly, aren't you?

01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:00.113
Yeah, l...I've done
a few bits and bobs, yeah.

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:01.639
I can't believe it's you!

01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:03.750
Yeah, yeah. I mean, it is.

01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:05.791
You were in that yoghurt commercial.

01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:08.798
- What? No.
- I love that advert!

01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:10.319
- Look...
- One time.

01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:14.035
This is Romeo, yeah?
And I'm his Juliet.

01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:15.195
(Girls) Ooh!

01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:18.118
So if any of you little groupies
want an autograph,

01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:20.879
you're going to have to go
to the stage door with everyone else.

01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:23.673
(Announcer)
Principals in position, please.

01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:25.358
- Babe...
- Hmm?

01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:27.516
- Call security right now.
- Yeah, OK.

01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:30.836
I would think twice about that,
if I were you.

01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:33.113
(Girls gasp)

01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:35.468
En garde.

01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:42.873
(Girls gasp)

01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:51.151
(Girls squeal)

01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:53.438
(Girls gasp)

01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:56.957
(Shouts)

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.275
(Girls squeal)

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.877
(Chelsea gasps)

01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:08.791
- Watering can?
- What's that gonna do?

01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:13.389
He's quite good with it.

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:18.788
(Girls squeal)

01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:36.309
(Applause)

01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:38.157
Bravo! Bravo!

01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:40.714
Oh, thank you very much.

01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:42.796
Oh, bravo! You were really good!

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:47.114
(Romeo groans)

01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:48.673
(Girls gasp)

01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:51.552
(Juliet sobs)

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:52.953
You killed him!

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.309
Oh, no!

01:18:56.680 --> 01:18:58.113
(Romeo mumbles)

01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:00.879
Oh, well, you...
you nearly killed him!

01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:03.229
(Juliet sobs)

01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:06.234
Oh, do be quiet,
you silly little girl!

01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:07.998
(Juliet groans)

01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:12.871
(Announcer) Romeo and Juliet
to the wings. At once!

01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:14.717
(Bianca) Great! Now what?

01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:21.151
(Fanfare)

01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:30.992
Romeo, Romeo,
wherefore art thou, Romeo?

01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:36.794
(Whispers) Romeo?

01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:39.839
(Audience laughs)

01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:42.794
(Giggles)

01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:56.150
- Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art...?
- I'm down here.

01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:01.996
Verily down here I am.

01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:04.278
Forsooth.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.434
- What happened to Fritton?
- She's not involved, sir.

01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:10.040
We got footage of her
heading to the theatre.

01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:13.595
Romeo And Juliet at the Globe.
It's meant to be rather good.

01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:19.435
Shakespeare's Globe!
We've got to stop them!

01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:21.516
(Annabelle) OK, girls. Let's move it.

01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:23.551
(Girls groan)

01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:27.436
(Bianca) Oh, my shoes!

01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:29.948
(Chelsea) Oh...my God!

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.194
Are they rats?

01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:35.676
No, they're little furry elephants!
What do you reckon?

01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:39.076
Rats? Nah, nah, nah!
I don't do rats, yeah?

01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:40.473
That's more Zoe's bag!

01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:43.193
I'm allergic to rats
and clingfilm and pumpkin seeds.

01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:44.309
Yeah, right!

01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:46.237
(Annabelle) Oh, well, never mind.

01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:49.352
We'll just tell the guys back
at school we didn't finish the job

01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:52.676
cos it was a bit dark and a bit cold
and someone saw a hamster.

01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:55.757
Chelsea, what about
your Malibu beach house?

01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:57.472
What about the all-girl moon mission?

01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:01.957
Do we really want that pig Pomfrey
and the AD1 lot to get the treasure?

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.718
Cos I know I don't.

01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:05.079
(Annabelle squeals)

01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:11.679
I have a faint cold fear
thrills through my veins.. (Gasps)

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:21.032
That almost freezes up
the heat of life.

01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:24.117
I'll call them back again
to comfort me. Nurse!

01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:25.912
(Sobs)

01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:27.279
What shall she do here?

01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:32.516
Gentle vial...

01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:36.553
Sir...isn't that...?

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:39.478
Guys, let's go.

01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:41.112
(Peters groans)

01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:43.993
Do I need to remind you we're
supposed to be a secret organisation?

01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:47.112
- No, of course. I thought that...
- Don't!

01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:50.195
There's no other way out.
The play's nearly over.

01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:52.390
We move as soon as it finishes.

01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:55.751
(Peters clears throat)

01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:58.360
Potion, make thy mark.

01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:01.632
Hmm.

01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:06.069
(Groans)

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.672
(Sighs)

01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:13.153
(Groans)

01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:16.112
(Audience laughs)

01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:17.718
(Camilla groans)

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:20.438
She's very good.

01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:23.795
Yes.

01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:27.628
OK, so we go left here
and then straight on.

01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:29.193
Oh, brilliant!

01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:31.879
Oh, no!

01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:33.911
(Chelsea sighs)

01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:36.749
(Roxy sighs)

01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:39.394
(Girl) What's happening, team?
The show's about to end.

01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:41.192
Um...we may need more time.

01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:45.272
Isn't that your cue?

01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:58.159
My dearest love...

01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:00.997
..please don't be dead!

01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:02.996
(Audience laughs)

01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:07.079
For...so much remains unsaid.

01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:10.278
(Lucy) It has to be there.

01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:12.356
Chelsea, what are you doing?

01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:16.272
Looking for a secret door.

01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:20.279
Places like this
always have a secret door.

01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:22.550
Chelsea, you truly are...

01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:36.315
I truly am what?

01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:39.909
Smarter than
your average brainless slapper?

01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:44.158
Yeah, smarter than
your average brainless slapper.

01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:46.998
You better believe it.

01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:50.075
(Straining)

01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:51.917
Ups we've had.

01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:55.150
And downs, yea, we've had a few.

01:23:56.080 --> 01:24:01.200
And...nights of rough and tumble
one or two.

01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:02.559
(Audience laughs)

01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:09.073
And now... It might be
the very moment to...do...

01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:14.911
..what I must admit I find it

01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:18.396
rather hard...to...do.

01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:22.079
And that is...to say

01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:26.231
..that I love...

01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:27.872
(Camilla gasps)

01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:29.148
That I love...

01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:30.758
(Camilla) Mm?

01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:35.198
That I love you.

01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:41.993
I love you.

01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:46.999
Cheers.

01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:52.518
Thus...with a kiss I die!

01:24:58.040 --> 01:25:00.031
They're rather good, aren't they?

01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:08.990
What kind of place is this?

01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:13.392
(Lucy) Look at the costumes.

01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:16.518
It must be part of the old Globe.

01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:20.269
(Girl) What's happening, team?
The show's nearly over.

01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:22.880
(Annabelle)
Keep it going. Whatever it takes.

01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:31.677
Bursar, Bursar...

01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:35.473
Huh?

01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:38.714
Oh, friendly dagger,

01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:41.797
plunge, plunge, plunge.

01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:42.989
(Groans)

01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:45.759
No! Not-Not yet!

01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:48.075
Not, not, not dead!

01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:49.269
Uh...

01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:52.349
Our...our play is not yet over.

01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:56.756
For our work is not yet done.

01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:03.119
Friends...

01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:06.109
..Romans...

01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:08.314
..countrymen...

01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:12.992
..if music be the food of love...

01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:15.918
Oh, for Christ's sake!
This is interminable!

01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:22.671
(Compass bleeps)

01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:38.269
(Rapid bleeping)

01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:41.039
Well, it must be here. Right here.

01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:47.794
Hmm.

01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:49.114
(Lucy gasps)

01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:50.388
Bingo!

01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:51.759
(Girls gasp)

01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:57.036
Oot! Oot, oot!

01:26:57.080 --> 01:26:59.071
Damn splot!

01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:00.109
Oot!

01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:06.510
- It's locked! It's locked!
- Hurry up!

01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:11.839
Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war!

01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:14.633
(Growls and barks)

01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:18.036
Calling all girls,
we need backup now.

01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:21.436
- What about the ring?
- I've got it.

01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:23.198
(Bianca) Oh, come on!

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:27.638
We're gonna be rich!

01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:33.078
(Girls gasp)

01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:37.511
What the...?

01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:39.630
(Lucy sighs)

01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:41.992
Bye-bye, Malibu.

01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:43.029
(Lucy sighs)

01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:46.914
You have got to be kidding me.

01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:51.191
Well, what's...? What's this?

01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:54.115
- Here.
- There's a little note.

01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:55.639
Oh, yay!

01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:01.037
"Treasure hunter come for nought

01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:02.911
"lt seems your dreams
have fallen short

01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:10.475
"For pirate though I may have been
I ventured for a change of scene

01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:14.308
"Resolving too to change my ways,

"from sailing seas to mounting plays.

"Writing many in this room,

01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:25.675
A nom de what?

01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:27.392
I think it means...

01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:33.313
No, it can't be!

01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:35.191
(Annabelle gasps)

01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:40.833
Pirate Fritton...was Shakespeare.

01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:48.675
Oh, my God!

01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:53.149
Hang on. That means...
That means I'm a Shakespeare.

01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:54.189
Yeah!

01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:56.879
(Audience cheers)

01:28:56.920 --> 01:28:58.239
Wait, wait, wait!

01:28:58.280 --> 01:29:04.389
"ln lieu of gold, I humbly pray,
you'll kindly take my final play"

01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:06.317
Oh, my God!

(Cheering)

01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:15.470
"And while indeed
you find it hard

01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:17.317

"..a girl."

01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:28.319
A girl?

01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:31.991
Wicked!

01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:36.358
(Lucy gasps)

01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:39.631
(Lucy) Shakespeare was a girl.
Oh, my God!

01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:42.114
The Bard is a bird.

01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:44.878
I love it!

01:29:44.920 --> 01:29:46.638
A woman...

01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:49.750
A woman wrote the Bible!

01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:51.518
(Chelsea squeals)

01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:53.516
(Girls mutter)

01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:57.795
(Mobile rings)

01:29:57.840 --> 01:30:00.434
(Pomfrey) Silvio, ciao.

01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:02.596
Yeah. Hey, call me in five.

01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:06.872
Just finishing something off.
Great. Ciao, ciao.

01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:10.833
Hello, girls. Remember me?
Of course you do.

01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:15.112
Congratulations on your little find.

01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:19.039
Finally the Frittons catch up to what
we Pomfreys have known for generations.

01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:23.596
That your celebrated sea dog
was a she-dog.

01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:31.113
(Chuckles)

01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:33.909
May l?

01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:44.233
Thanks awfully.

01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:49.355
We knew this inconvenient discovery
would turn up sooner or later.

01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:51.277
Just had to make sure
we got to it first.

01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:55.796
But all's well that ends well,
as the old boot said.

01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:57.751
Now we can destroy it.

01:30:57.800 --> 01:30:58.994
It's too late, Pomfrey.

01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:01.600
You can destroy the play
but the secret's out.

01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:04.108
Shakespeare was a woman
and we will tell the world.

01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:07.835
Oh...you're going to tell on me?

01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:10.269
Please don't tell on me!

01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:11.389
(Chuckles)

01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:12.919
Look at you!

01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:14.075
Who's gonna believe

01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:17.999
a bunch of jumped-up, porky-telling
little schoolgirls over me?

01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:21.510
I...I play tennis with Sting,
for Christ's sake.

01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:23.553
(Mumbles)

01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:24.635
No!

01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:27.837
(Girls sigh)

01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:31.509
(Girl) Annabelle, can you hear me?
The girls are on their way.

01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:33.596
It's too late.

01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:54.913
Wow!

01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:18.513
Au revoir! Auf Wiedersehen!

01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:20.073
Buggeration!

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.150
I think I have, like, an idea.

01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:32.111
The thing that amuses me most
is that these...these girls

01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:36.153
thought that
they could outsmart...well, me.

01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:40.475
Yes, what I don't
quite understand, sir,

01:32:40.520 --> 01:32:43.398
is why Shakespeare had to pretend
to be a man in the first place.

01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:44.839
Because, you complete moron,

01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:48.429
back in the good old days,
a woman couldn't do a man's job.

01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:51.271
Except Ms Shakespeare.

01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:53.914
She did a pretty good job
of being a man, if you ask me.

01:32:53.960 --> 01:32:56.394
- In fact, I'd go as...
- Peters, shut up!

01:32:56.440 --> 01:32:57.839
Yes, sir.

01:32:57.880 --> 01:32:58.949
(Pomfrey sighs)

01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:01.957
Load of girlie drivel.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:05.276
- Um...sir...
- Peters!

01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:07.276
Yes, I know, sir,
but if you would perhaps...

01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:31.830
Bloody women!

01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:37.434
- Fire!
- Fire!

01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:44.912
(Cheering)

01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:49.469
(Pomfrey coughs)

01:33:55.160 --> 01:33:57.674
(Camilla whoops)

01:33:57.720 --> 01:34:01.429
I'll take that,
you ghastly little turd! Avast!

01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:03.789
(Girls cheer)

01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:16.909
Wind power, man.
Told you it was the frickin' answer!

01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:20.954
Fire!

01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:29.312
(Both) Whoops!

01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:33.557
(Girls cheer)

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.116
? What's all that noise
coming down?

01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:42.469
? Trying to get my juice
in a major frown

01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:44.590
? That's all, phat boy, turn it round

01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:46.870
? Trying to get your bass
on solid ground

01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:49.229
? What's all that noise
coming down?

01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:51.589
? Trying to get my juice
in a major frown

01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:54.029
? That's all, phat boy, turn it round

01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:56.150
? Trying to get your bass
on solid ground

01:34:56.200 --> 01:34:58.156
? When there's madness in the air

01:34:58.200 --> 01:35:00.270
? Only the mad survive, oh, boy

01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:02.754
? And when there's madness in the air

01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:05.360
? Only the bad survive, oh, boy

01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:07.118
? And there's no time to stop and stare

01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:09.151
? Don't get behind the line, oh, yeah

01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:11.555
? And there's no time to stop and stare

01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:14.831
? Don't get behind the line, oh, yeah

01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:18.555
? Up and away, like I don't wait

01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:23.116
? Walking the line, knocking on time

01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:27.950
? Poppin' on by, have a little try

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:32.198
? Papa ain't shy, talking his mind

01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:49.115
I'm here on the banks of the Thames
waiting for Sir Piers Pomfrey,

01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:52.630
the head of the corrupt
secret society, AD1.

01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:54.671
And here he is.

01:35:54.720 --> 01:35:58.759
Sir Piers,
having been exposed as a sexist,

01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:00.756
how does it feel to have been beaten

01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:03.837
and now publicly humiliated
by a group of girls?

01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:08.717
Well, I think "humiliated" is a bit strong.

01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:14.032
Thank you.

01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:15.433
(Mouths)

01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:21.597
? You've got to take advantage
then you gotta lot to learn, my friend

01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:27.991
? Up and away, like I don't wait

01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:32.238
? Walking the line, knocking on time

01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:36.831
? Poppin' on by, have a little try

01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:42.716
? Papa ain't shy, talking his mind

01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:48.834
? Oh, babe, I am what I am

01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:51.348
? And I won't be damned if I do

01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:53.118
? I am what I am

01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:54.912
? Can you hear me talking to you?

01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:57.633
? Oh, babe, I am what I am

01:36:57.680 --> 01:36:59.875
? Gotta let me do what I do

01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:05.358
? I am what I am
and I won't get dragged down by you

01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:11.631
? Up and away, like I don't wait

01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:16.037
? Walking the line, knocking on time

01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:20.915
? Poppin' on by, have a little try

01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:25.954
? Papa ain't shy, talking his mind

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:30.232
? Up and away, like I don't wait

01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:35.149
? Walking the line, knocking on time

01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:39.352
? Poppin' on by, have a little try

01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:43.632
? Papa ain't shy, talking his mind

01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:48.276
? Up and away, like I don't wait

01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:53.314
? Walking the line, knocking on time

01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:58.115
? Poppin' on by, have a little try

01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:02.836
? Papa ain't shy, talking his mind ?

01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:42.237
? I see you

01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:45.795
? Watching me sleep deep

01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:49.758
? I feel you

01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:53.349
? Like some kind of cheap creep

01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:56.637
? You know me

01:38:57.680 --> 01:39:00.148
? I'm cruel to be kind

01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:02.509
? I'm fine

01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:08.351
? You love me and I don't mind

01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:10.595
? Wake up and smell reality

01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:12.756
? You're out of the groove
cos you're in trouble

01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:14.836
? Reality bit and burst the bubble

01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:18.316
? Face the heat, the pressure too
and if in doubt shout

01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:20.590
? You're out of the groove
cos you're in trouble

01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:22.517
? Reality bit and burst the bubble

01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:26.109
? Face the heat, the pressure too
and if in doubt shout

01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:30.278
? You go a little way to freak me out,
say something wrong to knock me out

01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:34.108
? Free your mind and scream and shout,
just make it easy

01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:37.709
? Maybe rock music I don't mind,
get a little mean and start a fight

01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:39.910
? Go head to head and cut me dead

01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:42.076
? Make it easy

01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:52.398
? You kissed me

01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:55.989
? Then you dragged me so low

01:39:57.280 --> 01:39:58.952
? You'll miss me

01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:03.113
? When I finally go

01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:04.912
? Wake up and smell reality

01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:07.235
? You're out of the groove
cos you're in trouble

01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:09.271
? Reality bit and burst the bubble

01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:12.949
? Face the heat, the pressure too
and if in doubt shout

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.468
? You're out of the groove
cos you're in trouble

01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:17.238
? Your attitude bit and burst the bubble

01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:20.909
? Move your feet, your body too
cos I don't want you

01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:24.919
? You go a little way to freak me out
say something wrong to knock me out

01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:28.919
? Free your mind and scream and shout,
just make it easy

01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:32.635
? Maybe rock music I don't mind,
get a little mean and start a fight

01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:34.750
? Go head to head and cut me dead

01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:36.791
? Make it easy ?
