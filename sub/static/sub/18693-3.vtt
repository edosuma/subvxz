You're a lifesaver.

00:18.733 --> 00:22.632

- Not by itself.

- Give me the stone.
- You need to stay near the surface.

It's an angelic bond.
My magic can only do so much.

02:14.716 --> 02:16.269
So Jace is like this, too?

02:17.948 --> 02:19.714
Not necessarily.

02:19.750 --> 02:21.750
It appears that when
Alec called out to him,

02:21.785 --> 02:23.371
part of his soul never returned.

02:23.442 --> 02:26.821
Now he's stuck, lost somewhere
between himself and his <i>parabatai.</i>

02:28.825 --> 02:31.470
But if Jace brought back that
missing piece of his soul...

02:31.530 --> 02:33.609
We may very well have the cure.

I said to you when you brought

06:03.518 --> 06:05.866
You didn't wanna get involved
in Shadowhunter business.

06:05.935 --> 06:07.991
And I should've
stuck to my guns.

06:08.069 --> 06:10.803
But no, I let you convince me.

06:14.885 --> 06:16.584

- I was only trying to find...

You were only trying to
do what you always do.

06:23.840 --> 06:26.882
Manipulate people into helping
fix problems that you created.

06:26.953 --> 06:28.730

Valentine's control.

06:50.854 --> 06:51.986
Uh, that's right.

06:53.023 --> 06:55.824
Did she Portal you to a
tanker ship in the East River?

06:58.960 --> 07:00.247
I'm not sure.

07:01.932 --> 07:06.213
Three hours ago, a large tanker ship
was found there, recently abandoned.

07:06.362 --> 07:08.254

07:08.330 --> 07:10.197

If you have any information
about Valentine, about Jace...

07:19.335 --> 07:21.169
you need to tell me.

07:24.921 --> 07:28.091
The last thing I remember is
Dot grabbing me off the street.

07:28.959 --> 07:31.501
Then I...
I woke up in the water.

07:31.583 --> 07:33.717
I was nearly run over by
the Staten Island Ferry,

07:33.752 --> 07:36.992

shore and came here.

If you're trying to protect your brother,
lying to me is only gonna make it worse.

if you help me bring him in.

07:49.631 --> 07:51.031

but I can't tell you what I don't know.

you lied to Aldertree.

I couldn't let him go after
Jace like he did before.

08:10.261 --> 08:14.864
So Dot took down the wards and you
two jumped off the ship together?

08:15.310 --> 08:18.511
Yeah, but as soon as we hit the
water, the tide was so strong.

08:19.061 --> 08:20.694
We lost each other...

08:20.944 --> 08:23.472
I looked everywhere.
I couldn't find him.

08:26.650 --> 08:28.444
Wait, if he and Alec are
going through the same thing,

08:28.468 --> 08:29.699
he wouldn't be able to swim.

08:29.784 --> 08:31.484
- He could be...
- No.

08:32.625 --> 08:33.988
Jace is alive.

Alec's <i>parabatai</i> rune would have faded.

- So that's good news, right?
- Yeah.

time Alec has left. (SIGHS)

13:30.723 --> 13:32.287
I just have to tell her
that my band went on tour,

13:32.311 --> 13:33.692
and I'll be right
back on Camille.

13:34.178 --> 13:36.551
You know, if you spent the amount
of time looking for Camille

13:36.575 --> 13:37.996
that you spend telling
me to look for her,

13:38.020 --> 13:38.716
you'd probably have
found her by now.

13:38.776 --> 13:41.574
I don't think you understand
the gravity of the situation.

13:41.643 --> 13:44.410
I've got the whole clan
searching, but she's your sire.

13:44.857 --> 13:46.479
But there are others, right?

13:46.514 --> 13:48.732
I can't be the most qualified
vampire Camille's turned.

13:49.584 --> 13:52.385
No, but sadly,
you're the only one left.

13:52.420 --> 13:55.031
All the other vampires she
sired have joined her side.

13:55.104 --> 13:58.491
There's a civil war brewing,
and Camille is gaining power.

13:58.565 --> 14:01.433
I'll be right back on Camille as
soon as I deal with my family.

14:03.565 --> 14:05.939
We are your family now.

14:06.172 --> 14:09.907
- And what? Just supposed to forget my mom?
- Your mom?

14:10.861 --> 14:13.369
Your mom will grow old
while you stay the same.

14:13.834 --> 14:15.800
And eventually she'll be gone.

14:16.578 --> 14:20.346
Sooner or later,
even your memories of her will fade,

14:20.499 --> 14:22.432
whether you want them to or not.

14:23.351 --> 14:27.052
No. That won't happen.
Not to me.

14:28.116 --> 14:29.606
Keep telling yourself that.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER ON TV)

14:59.287 --> 15:00.386
Oh, no.

15:02.355 --> 15:04.421
How are we gonna get Alec
to Magnus' apartment?

15:04.514 --> 15:07.127
- Aldertree has people everywhere.
- Not a problem.

15:07.202 --> 15:09.676
My parents want to
get Alec to Idris.

15:09.743 --> 15:12.502
Magnus will create a Portal.
We'll take it to Jace instead.

15:12.564 --> 15:15.201
- (CELL PHONE RINGING)
- Hey, Simon.

15:15.236 --> 15:18.401
(SHUDDERING) Clary, my mom's missing.
She's drinking again.

15:18.472 --> 15:19.975
- Oh, no.
- <i>It's all my fault.</i>

15:20.038 --> 15:22.363
She's been sober ever since that
bender she went on after Dad died,

15:22.387 --> 15:24.364
but I found a bottle of
vodka in her bedroom,

15:24.399 --> 15:26.557
and there hadn't been alcohol
in the house for years.

15:26.627 --> 15:28.635
Clary, if anything happened
to her because of me, I...

15:28.659 --> 15:30.402

15:34.922 --> 15:36.356
I don't know where she is.

15:36.973 --> 15:38.332
Clary, I need your help.

15:39.372 --> 15:40.372
Hang on.

15:42.025 --> 15:43.856
Izzy, Simon needs me.

15:45.132 --> 15:47.670
(SIGHS) Be there
for your friend.

15:47.764 --> 15:49.493
Magnus and I have
everything under control.

15:49.589 --> 15:50.621
Thanks, Izzy.

15:51.696 --> 15:52.696
I'm on my way.

15:53.081 --> 15:56.619
And Simon, grab something of Elaine's.
Something important to her.

15:56.681 --> 15:57.824
Uh...

15:57.899 --> 15:59.132
Okay, I got just the thing.

16:09.257 --> 16:10.356
LUKE: Look familiar?

16:10.583 --> 16:12.888
Yeah, he's prettier in
person, but that's the guy.

16:12.953 --> 16:14.271
Should have never
let him get away.

16:14.295 --> 16:17.652
After what he did to Gretel,
I vote we return the favor.

16:17.730 --> 16:19.265
This is not a democracy.

16:19.300 --> 16:21.557
Nobody kills anybody
until I say so.

16:21.658 --> 16:23.956
- Oh, he can, but we can't?
- That's not what I said.

16:24.031 --> 16:24.816
He kidnapped her.

16:24.882 --> 16:27.171
- What more evidence do you need?
- I was there.

16:27.240 --> 16:29.419
And the witness found him standing
over the body in the morning.

16:29.443 --> 16:32.483
I mean, you're the detective. Isn't that
what you call an open-and-shut case?

16:32.567 --> 16:34.213
No, it's not.

16:34.249 --> 16:36.273
Jace is too smart to leave
a body laying around.

16:36.351 --> 16:37.697
Whose side are you on?

16:37.768 --> 16:39.318
I'm on the side of the law.

16:39.400 --> 16:40.720
TAITO: Whose law?

16:40.800 --> 16:43.934
Chill, Taito. I think we've had
enough bar fights for one day.

16:44.004 --> 16:47.030
I know the rules.
Blood for blood.

16:47.103 --> 16:49.438
If Jace is really doing
Valentine's dirty work,

16:49.528 --> 16:51.361
I'll kill him myself.

16:59.592 --> 17:00.818
Best team.

17:01.291 --> 17:02.291
Best team.

17:02.885 --> 17:04.952
It's okay, Alec. You hear me?

17:05.144 --> 17:07.444
We're gonna get you out of
here and bring you back.

17:07.751 --> 17:10.089
You put in a request to
transfer your brother to Idris?

17:10.167 --> 17:12.224
My parents put in the request.

17:12.319 --> 17:14.319
Alec isn't leaving
this institute.

17:14.355 --> 17:16.910
I'm sure his warlock friend
can figure something out.

17:16.992 --> 17:18.191
Here.

17:18.358 --> 17:21.273
This isn't waking Sleeping
Beauty with a kiss.

17:21.789 --> 17:23.338
Runic power is deep.

17:23.442 --> 17:26.470
It requires magic that can't be
accessed in the walls of this institute.

17:27.233 --> 17:30.513
I don't know what you're up to,
and, ultimately, I don't care.

17:30.779 --> 17:34.107
But as far as I'm concerned,
your brother is too weak to be Portaled.

17:34.212 --> 17:36.973
You're just using Alec
as bait to arrest Jace.

17:37.040 --> 17:41.292
No, I'm working to capture the
fugitive who put Alec in this position.

17:41.370 --> 17:43.129
I have allowed this
warlock into the Institute

17:43.153 --> 17:45.788
for the sole purpose of
treating your brother.

17:46.681 --> 17:49.858
Although, you don't seem to
be doing too good a job of it.

18:29.397 --> 18:32.255

I'm naturally gifted.

- Yeah, sure.

25:47.697 --> 25:50.905
The Clave can be reasoned with.
The wolves can't.

25:51.899 --> 25:55.114
Just let me do this
one thing for my son.

25:55.779 --> 25:58.543
You know, I made it this far on my own.
I think I'll keep it that way.

26:04.954 --> 26:06.888
(GRUNTING)

26:08.472 --> 26:10.372
(PANTING)

26:18.903 --> 26:20.313
Still no improvement?

26:21.069 --> 26:22.069
Happy now?

26:24.415 --> 26:25.681
Not at all.

26:26.139 --> 26:27.806
Alec's one of our best.

26:28.605 --> 26:30.007
It'd be a shame to lose him.

26:33.396 --> 26:35.001
We're not gonna lose him.

26:36.629 --> 26:37.844
So confident.

26:38.943 --> 26:40.943
Almost too confident.

26:50.472 --> 26:51.571
(SCOFFS)

26:52.540 --> 26:54.905
Well, that's unfortunate.

26:54.995 --> 26:57.410
When are you gonna realize
that Jace is on our side?

26:57.445 --> 26:59.466
Our side doesn't
murder werewolves.

27:00.019 --> 27:01.052
Oh.

27:01.087 --> 27:03.754
So he didn't mention that
little transgression.

27:04.519 --> 27:05.777
I'm sure there's an explanation.

27:05.801 --> 27:07.654
Not according to
Lucian Graymark's pack.

27:07.708 --> 27:09.976
I was hoping to protect
Jace by bringing him here,

27:10.011 --> 27:12.045
but clearly you've
made other plans.

27:12.110 --> 27:15.292
So now it looks like the pack will
get their pound of flesh after all.

27:17.054 --> 27:19.789
How far is Luke's pack
from closing in on Jace?

27:20.137 --> 27:23.603
(CHUCKLES) Why should
I tell you anything?

27:23.733 --> 27:25.567
Because I know where Jace is.

27:27.973 --> 27:30.175
He's at Magnus'
loft in Brooklyn.

27:30.210 --> 27:32.010
Well then, the wolves are close.

27:32.514 --> 27:35.098
Getting to him before they
do could prove difficult.

27:35.683 --> 27:37.723
Not if you give me
access to a Portal.

27:38.553 --> 27:41.418
I'll save Jace and
I'll save Alec.

27:41.514 --> 27:42.514
All right.

27:42.666 --> 27:44.872
But afterwards,
you turn Jace over to me.

27:45.560 --> 27:46.790
Do we have a deal?

27:56.715 --> 28:00.617
(SOFTLY) Come back. Come back.
Please come back.

28:02.939 --> 28:06.141
I'm all out of answers.
I've tried everything.

28:09.517 --> 28:10.550
Except...

28:30.932 --> 28:32.765
(TAKES DEEP BREATH)

28:42.973 --> 28:44.290
Why aren't you getting ready?

28:44.348 --> 28:46.602
This is a mistake.
I'm not going through with it.

28:46.690 --> 28:48.285
(SCOFFS) That's hysterical.

28:48.320 --> 28:51.608
Whatever happened between you two,
why don't you just kiss and make up?

28:52.422 --> 28:53.692
This just doesn't feel right.

28:53.755 --> 28:55.646
You're not making any sense.

28:55.733 --> 28:58.931
All you've been talking about since
Jace arrived was becoming <i>parabatai.</i>

28:58.995 --> 29:00.437
And now you're
actually doing it.

29:00.472 --> 29:02.832
Well, I thought if anyone would
understand, it would be you.

29:03.333 --> 29:06.006
- You don't have one.
- I've never wanted one.

29:06.079 --> 29:08.052
But you and Jace click.

29:08.240 --> 29:11.538
Everyone knows you guys are better
fighters together than you are apart.

29:11.803 --> 29:13.613
Super helpful, Izzy. Thanks.

29:13.991 --> 29:17.926
All these years of training,
and you're just gonna call it off?

29:18.490 --> 29:19.955
Are you nuts?

29:21.347 --> 29:24.475
I mean, the only time
that actually happens

29:24.510 --> 29:26.644
is when somebody
falls in love with...

29:30.365 --> 29:31.365
Oh.

29:31.399 --> 29:33.034
Don't say another word.

29:33.148 --> 29:34.667
- I get it.
- No, you don't.

29:34.702 --> 29:37.077
Okay, maybe I don't.

29:38.773 --> 29:42.375
I know you're obnoxious
and stubborn...

29:42.410 --> 29:43.685
I hope you're going
somewhere with this.

29:43.709 --> 29:47.187
But you're also loyal and
honest and a big old softie

29:47.222 --> 29:49.923
when you stop worrying about what
people are thinking about you.

29:51.956 --> 29:55.591
One day, somebody's gonna love
you, heart and soul.

29:57.069 --> 30:01.144
If you walk away from Jace,
you might never find another <i>parabatai.</i>

30:01.265 --> 30:03.866
Is that really a risk
you're willing to take?

30:07.859 --> 30:08.925
(SIGHS)

30:18.838 --> 30:21.572
Clary, you did it. Thank you.

30:23.137 --> 30:27.171
Oh, um...
I think this is a solo mission.

30:27.206 --> 30:30.895
A good friend of mine convinced
me I should tell her the truth.

30:32.311 --> 30:34.727
Well, she sounds like
a very smart friend.

30:34.878 --> 30:36.308
Who said it was a she?

30:36.372 --> 30:37.572
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

30:39.350 --> 30:41.603
Hey, you got this.

30:51.613 --> 30:52.778
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

30:54.586 --> 30:55.652
(CHUCKLES)

31:00.086 --> 31:03.335
Clary,
Luke's pack wants Jace dead.

31:03.415 --> 31:04.898
They think he killed
one of their own.

31:04.922 --> 31:06.206
Wait, what?

31:06.297 --> 31:08.838
No, no, no. They have it all wrong.
Valentine killed her.

31:08.917 --> 31:10.696
Well, nobody told them that.

31:10.732 --> 31:13.532
They're closing in on him,
so I had to make a deal with Aldertree.

31:13.568 --> 31:15.088
<i>He has a warlock
creating a Portal now,</i>

31:15.140 --> 31:17.924
but even then, I don't know if I can
get to Jace before the pack does.

31:19.274 --> 31:20.340
Maybe I can.

31:25.822 --> 31:26.822
Mom.

31:28.057 --> 31:30.658
Simon? Oh, thank God!

31:31.287 --> 31:33.614
Oh, I thought something
terrible had happened.

31:33.721 --> 31:35.439
I have been looking
everywhere for you.

31:35.510 --> 31:36.866
I'm so sorry.

31:37.438 --> 31:40.640
There's something I need to
tell you about where I've been

31:40.750 --> 31:42.267
and who I am.

31:42.322 --> 31:44.164
It's all right. I know.

31:44.963 --> 31:45.731
You do?

31:45.814 --> 31:48.051
What, did you think I
wasn't going to find out?

31:48.656 --> 31:50.616
- I mean...
- Oh, monkey, you should have told me.

31:50.654 --> 31:52.453
I've been so worried.

31:54.375 --> 31:56.021
(STAMMERS) If your band
manager hadn't found me

31:56.045 --> 31:57.765
and told me everything
that's been going on,

31:57.842 --> 32:01.139
- I don't know what I would've done.
- My band manager?

32:01.246 --> 32:02.246
Yeah.

32:03.885 --> 32:05.651
Hello, Simon.

32:06.432 --> 32:07.632
You told my mom?

32:07.722 --> 32:09.388
(SCOFFS) Of course I did.

32:09.424 --> 32:11.624
I can't believe you didn't
tell her we were out on tour.

32:15.463 --> 32:16.874
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Right.

32:16.909 --> 32:20.160
I'm sorry, Mom.
My phone died, among other things.

32:20.234 --> 32:23.469
Well, Raphael was so kind to keep
me company until we found you.

32:23.504 --> 32:25.189
- (CHUCKLES)
- You know, Simon,

32:25.283 --> 32:26.850
you should take better
care of your mother.

32:26.874 --> 32:29.767
It's far too late for anyone to
be wandering the streets alone.

32:30.021 --> 32:32.726
I know you'd feel horrible if
anything were to happen to her.

32:33.278 --> 32:36.068
Oh, you're sweet,
but you don't have to worry about me.

32:36.851 --> 32:40.653
Oh, sweetie, you're so pale and...
Cold.

32:40.798 --> 32:42.255
Let me get you a hot drink.
I'll be right back.

32:42.279 --> 32:43.279
Thanks, Mom.

32:44.459 --> 32:45.491
What the hell?

32:45.526 --> 32:47.895
You should be looking for
Camille, not your mother.

32:47.974 --> 32:50.414
- You're threatening my family.
- And you're threatening mine.

32:50.540 --> 32:53.056
The longer Camille is free,
the more people she kills.

32:53.110 --> 32:54.843
My people.

32:56.238 --> 32:58.205
Don't make me stoop
to Camille's level.

32:59.239 --> 33:03.366
Well, now that Simon's back,
I think it's time I get going.

33:03.450 --> 33:07.663
Really? Oh, I wish there was something
I could do to thank you for everything.

33:07.749 --> 33:11.026
You know what? Why don't you
join us at our house for dinner?

33:11.081 --> 33:14.203
We can talk about Simon's music
career and his accounting career.

33:14.256 --> 33:16.219
Mom, he can't.
He's extremely busy.

33:16.254 --> 33:18.624
Honey, any friend of
yours is a friend of ours.

33:18.675 --> 33:21.376
You are welcome at
my house anytime.

33:24.796 --> 33:26.532
- To your home?
- Mmm-hmm.

33:26.645 --> 33:28.512
Well,
that's a lovely invitation.

33:30.671 --> 33:32.471
I'll see you soon, Simon.

33:45.261 --> 33:46.988

At home.

33:52.323 --> 33:53.323
Mom, this...

33:54.378 --> 33:55.735
This can't happen again.

33:58.755 --> 34:03.219
Your, um...
Your band manager seems... Nice.

34:03.254 --> 34:07.261
(SCOFFS) He's not.
Trust me, he sucks.

34:07.351 --> 34:09.318
But I told him to
put the tour on hold.

34:09.455 --> 34:11.304
From now on,
I'm only doing local gigs.

34:12.565 --> 34:14.498
So does that mean
you're moving home?

34:15.585 --> 34:16.902
I want to, yeah.

34:18.853 --> 34:20.702
But I just need to, you know...

34:20.902 --> 34:22.404
Get my stuff together.

34:22.491 --> 34:23.590
You promise?

34:24.574 --> 34:26.475
- I promise.

34:26.751 --> 34:28.650
God, I love you, monkey.

34:29.580 --> 34:31.280
I love you, too, Mom.

34:33.268 --> 34:34.400
Night, sweetie.

34:45.018 --> 34:46.440
You have to call off the pack.

34:46.475 --> 34:47.763
You're the alpha.
They'll listen to you.

34:47.786 --> 34:49.022
It's not that easy.

34:49.083 --> 34:51.610
The pack operates by
code, blood for blood.

34:51.645 --> 34:52.685
But it's not Jace's fault.

34:52.746 --> 34:54.335
He was tricked into
kidnapping Gretel.

34:54.371 --> 34:55.594
It was Valentine who killed her.

34:55.618 --> 34:58.156
Believe me, I know his
manipulations better than anybody,

- ALARIC: Luke.

- Give me a sec.
- Please...

Maia's caught up to Jace.

35:04.977 --> 35:06.871
He's on Front Street heading
towards the Brooklyn Bridge.

35:06.895 --> 35:08.935
- That's near Magnus' loft.
- Yeah, not near enough.

35:08.993 --> 35:10.660
Sounds like she's
moving in for the kill.

35:35.446 --> 35:36.854
And she was my friend.

You need to pay for
what you did to her.

I didn't kill her. (PANTING)

just like he's using you right now.
