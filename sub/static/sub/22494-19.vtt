00:18.184 --> 00:20.790
It's alive!

00:54.454 --> 00:56.195
We'll sell the derivatives
from the German account,

00:56.256 --> 00:57.326
not from the...

00:57.390 --> 00:58.960
Oh, hey Doug, my cell phone's
about to...

00:59.025 --> 01:01.005
Ughhh fuck.

01:08.535 --> 01:10.606
All those things I can do.

01:10.670 --> 01:12.741
All those powers.

01:12.806 --> 01:14.251
And I couldn't even save him.

01:17.377 --> 01:19.516
Hmm, guess I shouldn't
have doubled down

01:19.579 --> 01:21.581
on that KFC Double Down.

01:21.648 --> 01:23.286
Hmm.

01:24.851 --> 01:26.353
Pa!

01:26.419 --> 01:28.092
Oh no!

01:33.393 --> 01:35.771
Whoa!
Not good, not good!

01:35.829 --> 01:39.675
Um, oh compressions!
Maybe start compressions.

01:44.170 --> 01:45.547
Sorry dad.

01:45.605 --> 01:47.812
Oh no!
Uh Sparky come back here!

01:47.874 --> 01:49.512
Sorry Pa.

01:49.576 --> 01:50.884
Doctor, my penis doesn't work.

01:53.179 --> 01:54.385
What do you mean?

01:54.447 --> 01:55.755
Like it won't
make wee-wee-wee

01:55.815 --> 01:59.661
or it won't go
boioi-oi-oi-oing?

Now Rihanna, we're going
to learn to canter.

02:45.331 --> 02:46.867
You'll need to know this
for your new video!

02:46.933 --> 02:48.378
I changed my mind.
Horses are dumb as hell.

02:48.434 --> 02:51.608
I don't want my video to have
a dumb-ass horse in it.

02:51.671 --> 02:53.708
Oooh man! My neck! My legs!
My feet! My arms!

02:53.773 --> 02:56.811
I can't feel anything!
My fucking body's numb!

02:56.876 --> 03:00.551
Oats!
Oats oats oats, oats oats!

03:37.684 --> 03:39.220
Twilight the game!

03:41.354 --> 03:43.630
Approaching bank robbers
in their getaway tank, Michael.

03:43.690 --> 03:45.260
I recommend jumping over it.

03:45.325 --> 03:47.828
I love you, KITT!

03:47.894 --> 03:50.306
We saved
that busload of nuns, KITT.

03:50.363 --> 03:51.967
By jumping over it.

03:52.031 --> 03:54.102
I love you, Michael Knight!

03:55.368 --> 03:57.541
Man, I wish you were real,
KITT.

03:57.604 --> 03:59.277
We'd have some awesome
adventures.

03:59.339 --> 04:02.149
We'd fight all my enemies...

04:02.208 --> 04:04.347
and murder them...

04:04.410 --> 04:05.821
So cool...

04:06.813 --> 04:09.384
so... cool...

04:09.449 --> 04:11.656
Wow!

04:11.718 --> 04:13.891
I'm Knight Rider!
I'm Knight Ri...

04:13.953 --> 04:15.728
Awww wait a minute.

04:15.788 --> 04:17.324
You're that crappy KITT

04:17.390 --> 04:19.165
from that crappy
Knight Rider re-make

04:19.225 --> 04:21.296
from a few crappy years ago!

04:21.361 --> 04:23.671
Greetings, Michael.
Let's go on an adventure.

04:23.730 --> 04:25.607
No, no, no, no, no!

04:25.665 --> 04:27.372
Wake me up right now!

04:27.433 --> 04:29.106
Please stop.

04:29.168 --> 04:31.170
Wake me up!

04:31.237 --> 04:32.113
Please stop.

04:32.171 --> 04:33.673
No! Lemme out!

04:33.740 --> 04:34.741
No no no! Lemme out!

04:34.807 --> 04:35.808
Please stop. Michael.

04:35.875 --> 04:37.445
No! You suck ass!

04:37.510 --> 04:38.716
All you did in the whole
pilot episode

04:38.778 --> 04:40.155
was drive extra-fast!

04:40.213 --> 04:41.988
It was boring!

04:42.048 --> 04:43.186
Let me out!

04:43.249 --> 04:45.820
Fine. Hope you like
ejector seats.

04:47.954 --> 04:50.059
I don't seem to have
an ejector seat.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.500
Boring!

04:53.293 --> 04:55.068
Knight Rider.
A shadowy flight...

04:55.128 --> 04:56.607
Go die please.

04:56.663 --> 04:57.607
Aw.

04:57.664 --> 04:59.007
Having a bad day?

04:59.065 --> 05:01.568
My stupid dream has the wrong
Knight Rider car in it.

05:01.634 --> 05:03.079
Oh.
What'll it be?

05:03.136 --> 05:06.174
Hey, can I have lobster
with lots of butter sauce?

05:06.239 --> 05:08.150
And Oreo ice cream
served on a cookie

05:08.207 --> 05:09.413
the size of my head?

05:09.475 --> 05:10.715
Uh, we don't have that.

05:10.777 --> 05:12.450
But, this is a dream!

05:12.512 --> 05:15.049
Yeah, but we kind of blew our
budget on that.

05:15.114 --> 05:16.388
Greetings, Michael.

05:16.449 --> 05:17.985
Damn it!

05:18.051 --> 05:19.155
Welcome back, Michael.

05:19.218 --> 05:20.196
Hi, Val Kilmer.

05:20.253 --> 05:21.755
Shall I turn
into a pickup truck?

05:21.821 --> 05:22.993
I can do that.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.900
Wow. One of your amazing
features is hauling cargo.

05:25.958 --> 05:28.165
I can also turn from this kind
of Mustang

05:28.227 --> 05:30.764
into another kind of Mustang.

05:30.830 --> 05:33.003
Ugh. Do whatever.
I'm going to take a nap.

05:33.066 --> 05:35.239
You can't take a nap
in a dream!

05:35.301 --> 05:37.178
Of course you can.
Didn't you see Inception?

05:37.236 --> 05:38.237
Only a hundred million people
saw it.

05:38.304 --> 05:39.510
It was so cool...

05:39.572 --> 05:41.574
so... cool.

05:41.641 --> 05:44.247
Ohmigosh!
I'm in the real KITT!

05:44.310 --> 05:45.846
You're the real Knight Rider!

05:45.912 --> 05:47.482
Are you ready
to fucking do this?

05:47.547 --> 05:48.457
Hell yes!

05:48.514 --> 05:49.891
Press my Turbo Boost button.

05:49.949 --> 05:52.088
I will!

06:14.240 --> 06:17.278
I love you, real KITT.

06:17.343 --> 06:18.879
Oh. Ouch.

06:18.945 --> 06:21.824
Fuck you, Val Kilmer.

06:21.881 --> 06:23.656
Swat your balls?
Get a good ball swatting.

06:23.716 --> 06:25.024
Who doesn't want their
balls swatted?

06:25.084 --> 06:26.188
Come on, why don't you take
those pants right down,

06:26.252 --> 06:27.094
there you go, there you go.

06:27.153 --> 06:28.325
Lemme swat those balls!

06:28.388 --> 06:30.163
May this golden spike symbolize

06:30.223 --> 06:33.033
the power of the railroad,
which will last forever!

06:33.092 --> 06:36.130
At least until people stop
giving a shit about trains,

06:36.195 --> 06:37.902
which I predict
will never happen!

06:37.964 --> 06:39.375
Today, that golden spike resides

06:39.432 --> 06:41.002
at the Who Gives a Fuck Museum,

06:41.067 --> 06:43.570
located directly up my ass.

06:43.636 --> 06:47.106
Decepticons! Attack!

06:49.675 --> 06:51.552
What?

06:57.016 --> 06:59.519

07:13.866 --> 07:15.937
Hello, Spock.
Nice to meet you.

07:16.002 --> 07:18.278
I'm you, 30 years older,
from the future.

07:18.337 --> 07:19.441
How did you get here?

07:19.505 --> 07:20.711
Through a black hole.

07:20.773 --> 07:22.275
Listen, in 10 years,
you'll fight against

07:22.341 --> 07:24.014
an Evil Klingon named Klorg.
- Alright.

07:24.076 --> 07:25.749
And he'll swing his Bat'leth
to the right.

07:25.812 --> 07:28.053
So dodge left and you will avoid
a week in the hospital.

07:28.114 --> 07:29.491
Oh. Thank you.

07:29.549 --> 07:30.960
Oh, and also in about
seven years,

07:31.017 --> 07:32.724
DJ Zumura will release
a greatest hits album

07:32.785 --> 07:34.594
and it's awesome, so you
should definitely get that.

07:34.654 --> 07:36.327
- Okay.
- But then 2 years after that...

07:36.389 --> 07:38.232
they're going to release
a DJ Zumura compilation album

07:38.291 --> 07:39.827
and even though it has
a different cover,

07:39.892 --> 07:41.872
it has all the same songs,
so don't buy it.

07:41.928 --> 07:42.906
Alright.

07:42.962 --> 07:44.464
Not life-threatening,
per se, but good to know.

07:44.530 --> 07:46.532
Do not go down that hallway.
- Who are you?

07:46.599 --> 07:48.374
I'm you,
five minutes in the future.

07:48.434 --> 07:50.471
Three minutes from now Kirk
is gonna drop a monumental deuce

07:50.536 --> 07:51.879
in the hallway bathroom.
- Sure.

07:51.938 --> 07:53.940
And it's gonna smell really,
really bad, trust me.

07:54.006 --> 07:56.509
So, just maybe take
another hallway.

07:56.576 --> 07:57.816
Okay. Thanks.

07:57.877 --> 07:59.550
- Spock.
- Who are you, my sister?

07:59.612 --> 08:01.023
No, I'm you, Spock.

08:01.080 --> 08:02.423
One night 12 years from now

08:02.482 --> 08:03.825
you have one
too many zingaro shots,

08:03.883 --> 08:05.191
lose a bet,
and get a sex change.

08:05.251 --> 08:06.628
Why is Old Spock a man?

08:06.686 --> 08:08.097
I changed back.

08:08.154 --> 08:09.861
There are some problems
with the equipment though.

08:09.922 --> 08:11.595
Not going to lie.
- Hey, Spock.

08:11.657 --> 08:13.500
Don't tell me...
you're me, from the future,

08:13.559 --> 08:15.869
but somehow I turn into
an overweight black guy.

08:15.928 --> 08:18.534
Uh, no, I'm Ernie.
Just heading down the hallway.

08:18.598 --> 08:20.805
Live long and bite me.

08:20.867 --> 08:22.869
Damn, someone set their phaser
to stank back here!

08:22.935 --> 08:24.881
Why are all you Spocks
meeting me

08:24.937 --> 08:26.382
at this exact moment?

08:26.439 --> 08:28.316
Didn't you get the note?
It's all of our birthdays.

08:28.374 --> 08:29.785
We're throwing a surprise
birthday party

08:29.842 --> 08:31.344
for Super Old Spock.

08:31.410 --> 08:32.946
He turns 2000 years old today

08:33.011 --> 08:34.957
and this was the best place
we could all meet up.

08:35.014 --> 08:36.322
Are all the other Spooks ready?

08:36.381 --> 08:38.089
Ready!

08:38.150 --> 08:39.788
It seems so illogical

08:39.852 --> 08:41.558
to travel through time
to this location.

08:41.621 --> 08:43.157
Happy Birthday!

08:43.222 --> 08:44.826
Go Spock. It's your birthday.

08:44.891 --> 08:46.370
It is the day of your birth.

08:46.425 --> 08:48.029
By the year 2013,

08:48.094 --> 08:50.165
due to an insatiable desire
of audiences everywhere,

08:50.229 --> 08:52.368
almost every television show
involved vampires

08:52.431 --> 08:54.411
and the ones
that didn't failed miserably.

08:54.467 --> 08:56.879
Now we offer you a glimpse of
this very bloody future...

08:56.936 --> 08:59.746
<i>This week on Vampire Medical.</i>

08:59.805 --> 09:01.284
Gunshot wound.
He's losing blood fast.

09:01.340 --> 09:02.876
Let's get him a blood
transfusion, stat.

09:02.942 --> 09:04.012
We're all out of blood again,
doctor.

09:04.076 --> 09:06.056
Dammit. Who here keeps drinking
all the blood?

09:06.112 --> 09:08.456
Alright, we're probably gonna
lose him then.

09:08.514 --> 09:11.791
Might as well get together
and drink all of his blood.

09:16.789 --> 09:19.770
Is it...
"I want to suck your dick?"

09:20.760 --> 09:22.262
Help!

09:22.328 --> 09:23.807
We've got to save that kid!

09:23.863 --> 09:26.139
We can't! We'll be burned
in the sunlight!

09:26.198 --> 09:28.906
I'm wearing SPF 100.
I'll give it a shot.

09:32.705 --> 09:35.151
It's 3 and 2 to Derek Jeter.
Here's the pitch.

09:35.207 --> 09:36.242
It's a base hit
straight up the middle

09:36.309 --> 09:37.310
but Jeter trips on his cape!

09:37.376 --> 09:38.855
So does Rodriguez!

09:38.911 --> 09:39.889
Martinez runs to make
what should be an easy stop

09:39.946 --> 09:41.550
and he trips on his cape too!

09:41.614 --> 09:43.116
Again, the cape issue
rears its ugly head

09:43.182 --> 09:44.593
in Major League Baseball.

09:44.650 --> 09:46.652
It's literally impossible
to make good pasta

09:46.719 --> 09:48.494
without garlic.

09:48.554 --> 09:50.591
But since I'm a vampire
or whatever,

09:50.656 --> 09:52.226
I don't use garlic.

09:52.291 --> 09:54.202
Because vampires
don't use garlic

09:54.260 --> 09:56.206
and my producer said
I need to be a vampire.

09:56.262 --> 09:57.707
This is ridiculous.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.333
Do I really need to be
a vampire?

09:59.398 --> 10:00.809
Yeah, Martha, it's network rule.

10:00.866 --> 10:02.209
Sorry, gotta,
yeah it's vampire.

10:02.268 --> 10:04.680
Fine, I'm a stupid vampire.

10:06.839 --> 10:08.375
Vampires are very big right now.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.614
Would you say REO Speedwagon
are a lot like vampires?

10:10.676 --> 10:13.179
You know?
Because you suck?

10:13.245 --> 10:16.055
Oh, great.
Another ambush interview.

10:17.383 --> 10:18.919
Hey, bring the speedwagon
around.

10:18.985 --> 10:20.259
