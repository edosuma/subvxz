00:08.908 --> 00:12.277
Mom is having sex
with Gabe's dad.

00:12.279 --> 00:14.213
That's not true.
It's true.

00:14.215 --> 00:16.181
That is such a disturbing image.

00:16.183 --> 00:19.451
We know you've been sleeping
with Gabe's dad.

00:19.453 --> 00:21.053
I've been having an affair.

00:21.055 --> 00:23.188
No. No.
No.

00:23.190 --> 00:26.458
I've decided we're
getting divorced.

00:26.460 --> 00:28.527
I thought this was fixable.

00:28.529 --> 00:29.862
If you don't divorce
Elizabeth,

00:29.864 --> 00:31.530
and you are willing
to work on things,

00:31.532 --> 00:34.566
then I will let you write
your book "Finding Carter."

00:34.568 --> 00:35.167
You were with him?

00:35.169 --> 00:36.368
You overheard the whole
conversation?

00:36.370 --> 00:37.403
It was just David
saying that

00:37.405 --> 00:42.007
you were staying and Lori
should go and leave us alone.

00:42.009 --> 00:44.109
That was it?
Nothing about a meeting?

00:44.111 --> 00:45.611
Thank you for arranging
this meeting.

00:45.613 --> 00:50.215
Is it possible she'd rather not
see you than say good-bye?

00:50.217 --> 00:54.520
Everything he told me was a l--
Oh, my God.

01:00.660 --> 01:02.461
(loud music playing inside)

01:02.463 --> 01:04.063
Carter.

01:04.065 --> 01:06.131
What's going on?

01:08.301 --> 01:10.002
Go back to sleep.

01:10.004 --> 01:12.237
Yeah, that's gonna happen.

01:12.239 --> 01:14.807
All right.
I'm coming in.

01:14.809 --> 01:18.277
So am I.

01:19.712 --> 01:21.380
(loud pop music playing)

01:21.382 --> 01:23.482

Okay?
(cell phone ringing)

02:06.293 --> 02:07.326
You know what?
This is your dad.

02:07.328 --> 02:08.727
Let me just tell him that
you're on your way.

02:08.729 --> 02:10.462
No, please.
No, I can't.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.931
What did your dad do
that has you so upset?

02:12.933 --> 02:15.701
He took me to see my mom.

02:15.703 --> 02:16.435
He took you to see Lori?

02:16.437 --> 02:19.138
He said the two of them had
a lovely phone conversation

02:19.140 --> 02:21.740
in which they discussed how
difficult it must have been

02:21.742 --> 02:24.743
for me to make the decision
to stay here with you guys

02:24.745 --> 02:25.811
and not run off with her.

02:25.813 --> 02:28.881
He didn't--
That's not true.

02:30.850 --> 02:33.485
And we waited for almost
three hours.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.454
What?
Three hours in his car,

02:35.456 --> 02:37.956
sitting with him,
and the whole time,

02:37.958 --> 02:39.725
he knew we were waiting
for something

02:39.727 --> 02:41.093
that was never going
to happen.

02:41.095 --> 02:45.430
Well, you know, your dad,
he does have flaws,

02:45.432 --> 02:47.065
but he is not cruel.

02:47.067 --> 02:50.202
Really?
That's not cruel?

02:50.204 --> 02:51.436
Oh, my God.

02:51.438 --> 02:54.840
I told him he could start
writing his book.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.708
You're letting him write
"Finding Carter"?

02:56.710 --> 03:00.412
Yeah.
I wanted him to be happy.

03:00.414 --> 03:02.881
Well, here's the thing
about your dad, Carter.

03:02.883 --> 03:04.383
He's not a liar.

03:04.385 --> 03:07.786
He's not, he just--
He hides things.

03:18.231 --> 03:24.570
There's an explanation,
and I'm gonna get it.

03:25.405 --> 03:27.272
Okay?

03:28.541 --> 03:30.042
All right.

03:30.044 --> 03:32.544
Now we should go.

03:34.047 --> 03:36.215
Can I drive your car?

03:36.217 --> 03:37.316
Why?

03:37.318 --> 03:39.918
Because I'm really sad, and
I would really be cheered up

03:39.920 --> 03:43.188
by driving a really fast car
with, like, sirens and stuff.

03:43.190 --> 03:46.358
Oh, yeah.
Nice try.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.560
Come on.

03:51.364 --> 03:53.198
So how are things at home?
My dad's a mess.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.500
He's being strong,
but I can see through it.

03:55.502 --> 03:58.070
I wish there was something
I could say to make it better.

03:58.072 --> 03:59.238
I appreciate that.

03:59.240 --> 04:00.739
What's up, guys?

04:00.741 --> 04:03.375
Ofe, man, what happened?
Oh, my God.

04:03.377 --> 04:06.144
Wanna say, "You should see the
other guy," but he looks great.

04:06.146 --> 04:07.312
Not a scratch on him.

04:07.314 --> 04:08.080
Who's the other guy?

04:08.082 --> 04:09.414
Dude, you gotta
press charges.

04:09.416 --> 04:10.782
This is just the cost
of doing business.

04:10.784 --> 04:13.585
Got a customer, placed
a big bet on a long shot

04:13.587 --> 04:16.521
and it paid off,
and now I, uh, I owe him.

04:16.523 --> 04:18.624
The only problem is I've been
letting people pay me

04:18.626 --> 04:21.260
with their bar mitzvah savings
bonds, so I'm low on cash.

04:21.262 --> 04:23.095
Low as in "L."
Anybody seen Bird?

04:23.097 --> 04:26.932
She's over there,
talking with <i>Ramon.</i>

04:26.934 --> 04:29.534
(French accent)
The flavor of the week.

04:29.536 --> 04:30.902
Bird! Yo!

04:30.904 --> 04:33.372
I have a medical emergency.

04:33.374 --> 04:35.841
Medical emergency.
Ugh.

04:35.843 --> 04:36.608
This better be good.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.343
What do you think?
Good enough?

04:38.345 --> 04:39.211
Yeah, what happened?

04:39.213 --> 04:43.448
What happened is I need my bank
to cover some debts.

04:43.450 --> 04:44.349
Wait, you're his bank?

04:44.351 --> 04:45.851
It's not a charity.
She makes money.

04:45.853 --> 04:47.419
I don't make money.
Yes, you do.

04:47.421 --> 04:49.454
Enough to cover your...
Manis and pedis?

04:49.456 --> 04:52.591
It's more an emotional
investment than it is financial.

04:52.593 --> 04:53.091
That's right.

04:53.093 --> 04:56.094
Shows my undying gratitude,
which is worth something.

04:56.096 --> 04:56.995
Nobody say manis and pedis.

04:56.997 --> 04:58.964
Ofe, this is a really
bad time, okay?

04:58.966 --> 05:02.367
My parents are back in town for
the first time in eight months.

05:02.369 --> 05:03.201
They're really happy
to see me,

05:03.203 --> 05:05.170
but not so happy to see
my credit card bills.

05:05.172 --> 05:07.606
They're making me meet
with their accountant.

05:07.608 --> 05:10.242
That's your idea
of a bad time?

05:10.244 --> 05:11.276
Okay.
Well, this is mine.

05:11.278 --> 05:14.379
And next on this guy's list?
My elbows, or kneecaps.

05:14.381 --> 05:17.749
I get to choose which half of my
body I want to lose the use of.

05:17.751 --> 05:19.718
Ofe, you need to go
to the police.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.019
Yeah, seriously.
And what?

05:21.021 --> 05:24.156
Hope they turn a blind eye to my
illegal bookmaking operation?

05:24.158 --> 05:26.658
Okay, I'll figure
something out.

05:26.660 --> 05:29.161
By tomorrow?
As soon as I can.

05:29.163 --> 05:30.762
Hi.
Hey, Taylor.

05:30.764 --> 05:31.630
What happened to you?

05:31.632 --> 05:32.898
Nothing that prevents me
from seeing

05:32.900 --> 05:34.466
how very alluring
you look today.

05:34.468 --> 05:37.436
Thanks.
I'm flattered...

05:37.438 --> 05:39.271
and uncomfortable.

05:39.273 --> 05:43.141
Um, can I have
the car keys?

05:43.143 --> 05:44.343
It's second period.

05:44.345 --> 05:47.212
Can I please just
have the car keys?

05:47.214 --> 05:49.414
Are you skipping class?

05:49.416 --> 05:51.550
Ooh...

05:51.552 --> 05:53.785
Walk with me.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.490
This is new.
Big deal.

05:58.492 --> 06:01.993
I'm skipping school.
I've done it before.

06:01.995 --> 06:05.097
Here.
Be safe.

06:05.099 --> 06:07.866
Have fun.
Come here.

06:07.868 --> 06:10.469
Don't be nervous.
It's gonna be great.

06:10.471 --> 06:13.705
I've driven before.

06:13.707 --> 06:16.274
I have a pretty good idea
where you're going

06:16.276 --> 06:17.776
and what you're going to do.

06:17.778 --> 06:19.244
I'm happy for you.

06:19.246 --> 06:21.646
Seriously, Max is
a really great guy.

06:21.648 --> 06:23.014
You both really care
about each other.

06:23.016 --> 06:25.417
As usual, you're doing
everything perfectly,

06:25.419 --> 06:27.085
including losing
your virginity.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.253
So don't worry about it.

06:28.255 --> 06:29.154
Okay.
Okay?

06:29.156 --> 06:33.492
It has to be perfect.
You only get one chance.

06:34.293 --> 06:36.027
Do I look like
I'm trying too hard?

06:36.029 --> 06:37.262
No, you look really nice.

06:37.264 --> 06:38.330
Are you sure?
Yeah.

06:38.332 --> 06:38.997
You smell amazing today.

06:38.999 --> 06:41.199
I was going to
tell you earlier.
You like it?

06:41.201 --> 06:42.567
Go.
Okay.

06:42.569 --> 06:46.605
Next time you see me, I'll be
a different person.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.540
Totally changed.
Mm-hmm.

06:48.542 --> 06:50.475
You're already
totally changed.

06:50.477 --> 06:52.711
I like it.

06:52.713 --> 06:54.646
Okay.
See you.

06:54.648 --> 06:56.782
Bye.

06:59.986 --> 07:00.719
Mm.

07:00.721 --> 07:04.589
Please tell me I'm smelling
cookies and not some new
air freshener.

07:04.591 --> 07:07.192
These cookies are for
Grant's bake sale at school,

07:07.194 --> 07:09.594
and those just came out
of the oven.

07:09.596 --> 07:10.395
I'm in heaven right now.

07:10.397 --> 07:11.897
You just got back
from your editor?

07:11.899 --> 07:14.800
How did it go?
Notes.

07:14.802 --> 07:15.734
More notes.
Endless notes.

07:15.736 --> 07:18.770
This book will get published,
and I'll still be getting notes.

07:18.772 --> 07:21.072
Please tell me that I don't
have to wait that long

07:21.074 --> 07:22.474
before I can read it.

07:22.476 --> 07:23.508
Soon, I promise.

07:23.510 --> 07:25.043
Okay, change of subject.

07:25.045 --> 07:28.713
Why did you take Carter
to see Lori?

07:28.715 --> 07:31.650
Kind of an awful thing to do,
don't you think?

07:31.652 --> 07:33.718
It was awful.

07:33.720 --> 07:36.721
I wanted her to feel that her
decision to stay with us

07:36.723 --> 07:37.489
was the right one,

07:37.491 --> 07:40.792
and hopefully she'll
never know it was a set-up.

07:42.728 --> 07:44.262
What?

07:44.264 --> 07:45.363
She knows.

07:45.365 --> 07:45.931
What did you say?

07:45.933 --> 07:48.900
I told her the truth about
what we said to Lori

07:48.902 --> 07:49.534
the night we called.

07:49.536 --> 07:50.635
I didn't know
it was a thing.

07:50.637 --> 07:52.537
I had to protect my family,
so I got rid of Lori.

07:52.539 --> 07:55.507
I spent the night convincing
Carter that you weren't a liar,

07:55.509 --> 07:58.610
that you just have
these weird secrets.

07:58.612 --> 07:59.678
But this was a lie.

07:59.680 --> 08:03.348
You want to talk about
secrets and lies?

08:05.384 --> 08:07.419
I gotta find Carter.

You like the music?

10:37.137 --> 10:40.105
I love the music.

10:47.680 --> 10:51.016
Don't be afraid to speak up.

10:51.018 --> 10:52.951
If you don't like the way
something feels.

10:52.953 --> 10:58.923
Or if you want me to stop or
adjust or-- I can change--

10:58.925 --> 11:00.325
Max...

11:00.327 --> 11:01.793
Yeah.

11:01.795 --> 11:05.597
This is starting to sound
like Driver's Ed.

11:05.599 --> 11:08.166
Sorry.

11:08.168 --> 11:13.505
It's your first time, and
I want it to be perfect.

11:14.507 --> 11:17.075
Should we turn off
the light?

11:17.077 --> 11:18.243
Is that what you want?

11:18.245 --> 11:20.779
Oh, I don't know.
I just thought--

11:20.781 --> 11:22.414
I want to do it however...

11:22.416 --> 11:25.283
you think is
the best way to do it.

11:25.285 --> 11:29.187
Every way is the best way,

11:29.189 --> 11:30.689
but it's your first time,

11:30.691 --> 11:35.326
so you should just be
completely comfortable.

11:35.328 --> 11:38.697
Um... okay, yeah.

11:38.699 --> 11:40.265
Off, I guess.
Off?

11:40.267 --> 11:42.934
Okay, I'll turn it off.
All right.

12:03.589 --> 12:09.127
I can't really see you.
Could we turn the lamp on?

12:09.129 --> 12:11.463
Not that lamp.

12:11.465 --> 12:12.664
I found that lamp
on the street,

12:12.666 --> 12:16.234
and I thought it was really
cool, but it doesn't work.

12:16.236 --> 12:21.539
Which is probably why
I found it on the street.

12:21.541 --> 12:24.976
There's a hardware store
just a couple blocks away,

12:24.978 --> 12:26.144
so I'll run out and--

12:26.146 --> 12:27.912
No, Max,
you don't have to go--

12:27.914 --> 12:29.247
No, this is your
first time.

12:29.249 --> 12:34.753
You should have a lamp.
Yeah, okay.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.998
Hello?

13:00.379 --> 13:02.380
(Ofe)
I don't know what
I'm going to do.

13:02.382 --> 13:03.548
That looks pretty bad.

13:03.550 --> 13:06.684
Give me a name.

13:06.686 --> 13:07.986
What's that supposed to mean?

13:07.988 --> 13:10.622
Don't worry about it.
It means nothing.

13:10.624 --> 13:11.723
This was my mistake.

13:11.725 --> 13:14.959
I got cocky, I started
taking large bets.

13:14.961 --> 13:17.328
I learned
a valuable lesson.

13:17.330 --> 13:18.930
Stay in your league.

13:18.932 --> 13:20.965
Do you do that?

13:20.967 --> 13:22.267
Do you beat people up?

13:22.269 --> 13:25.737
I didn't say anything about
beating anybody up.

13:25.739 --> 13:27.472
I'm serious, Crash.

13:27.474 --> 13:32.343
I'm not going to
beat anybody up, okay?

13:32.345 --> 13:35.413
Okay?
Come on.

13:35.415 --> 13:37.782
(easy pop music playing)

13:49.762 --> 13:52.730
What's wrong?

13:52.732 --> 13:54.132
I don't know.

13:54.134 --> 13:57.402
It's like...
I'm nervous.

13:57.404 --> 13:59.304
It's like, suddenly
I don't know what to do.

13:59.306 --> 14:04.509
I don't know what order
to do this all.

14:04.511 --> 14:07.445
Just so you know,
I'm not saying I'm great,

14:07.447 --> 14:09.747
but usually,
I'm better than this.

14:09.749 --> 14:12.450
Why are you so nervous?

14:12.452 --> 14:16.621
'Cause I'm your first.

14:16.623 --> 14:19.457
And that's--
That's a great honor.

14:19.459 --> 14:22.527
I don't know what's going
to come after me,

14:22.529 --> 14:25.129
and I don't want to think
about those guys.

14:25.131 --> 14:29.234
It's just--
Neither do I.

14:29.236 --> 14:34.505
But it's like I already want
to be better than them.

14:34.507 --> 14:38.943
I want to be your first, but
I also want to be your best.

14:38.945 --> 14:43.348
You will be.
I know you will be.

14:44.383 --> 14:46.484
I'm already--
I'm already terrible.

14:46.486 --> 14:49.721
No, like, I went out
and bought you a lamp.

14:49.723 --> 14:53.291
That's just-- I got--
I got nervous.

14:53.293 --> 14:57.128
Then I told you that I got
nervous, and then after that,

14:57.130 --> 15:00.398
I told you, like,
the why I'm nervous.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.166
I shouldn't have done that.

15:02.168 --> 15:04.669
Now I realize that I'm
telling you that I'm terrible.

15:04.671 --> 15:09.207
But what I'm trying
to say is I'm sorry.

15:09.209 --> 15:11.175
It's okay.

15:11.177 --> 15:12.443
It's fine.
It's fine.

15:12.445 --> 15:13.378
We can do it another time.

15:13.380 --> 15:16.247
Can we do it another time?
Yeah.

15:21.053 --> 15:23.688
I'll see you.
Okay?

15:23.690 --> 15:27.258
All right.
I'll see you.

15:32.665 --> 15:35.566
Hey, good-bye.

15:40.406 --> 15:42.240
Here.

15:42.242 --> 15:44.909
Don't say your bank didn't
do anything for you.

15:47.212 --> 15:50.148
Oh, my God.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.550
Bird...
you shouldn't have.

15:52.552 --> 15:54.652
I know.
Bird, where did you get that?

15:54.654 --> 15:58.856
My mom's jewelry closet,
and yes, I said <i>closet.</i>

15:58.858 --> 15:59.624
It's not like she'll miss it.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.159
What am I supposed
to do with it?

16:01.161 --> 16:03.594
Sell it, pawn it,
pay off your debt.

16:03.596 --> 16:06.831
Me in a pawn shop
with this necklace?

16:06.833 --> 16:10.001
I don't have the right shoes.

16:10.003 --> 16:11.636
Give it to me.

16:11.638 --> 16:14.005
Yeah, I know a few places.
I'll take care of it.

16:14.007 --> 16:17.141
No, Crash, you can't get
involved with this.

16:17.143 --> 16:19.477
It's not like it's stolen.
It's mine.

16:19.479 --> 16:20.178
Eventually.

16:20.180 --> 16:23.648
Are you worried about me?

16:23.650 --> 16:25.249
Yes.

16:25.251 --> 16:26.751
This is the first time

16:26.753 --> 16:28.453
anybody's ever been
worried about me.

16:28.455 --> 16:32.457
Which means I get to say
don't worry.

16:32.459 --> 16:33.992
Okay?

16:33.994 --> 16:35.960
This is simple.

16:38.030 --> 16:40.365
Crash.

16:40.367 --> 16:41.466
I love you.

16:41.468 --> 16:43.835
Um, hello?

16:44.403 --> 16:47.972
I love you too.
I could never repay you.

16:49.408 --> 16:52.276
It's a figure of speech.
I'll repay you.

16:58.117 --> 16:59.417
Hello?

17:29.114 --> 17:31.149
So?

17:31.151 --> 17:34.719
How'd it go?

17:34.721 --> 17:36.087
Oh, what happened?

17:36.089 --> 17:37.955
Nothing.
Nothing?

17:37.957 --> 17:42.493
He said he was nervous, and then
he was getting all competitive

17:42.495 --> 17:46.697
with the boyfriends that I don't
even want because I have him.

17:46.699 --> 17:48.399
All right.

17:48.401 --> 17:51.069
So today didn't count.
You'll try again.

17:51.071 --> 17:52.070
It's no big deal.

17:52.072 --> 17:54.739
I'm not sure he wants to.

17:54.741 --> 17:57.041
Taylor, come on.
He wants to.

17:57.043 --> 17:57.675
He really likes you.

17:57.677 --> 18:01.446
Like, really, really,
really likes you, Taylor.

18:01.448 --> 18:03.581
I really, really,
really, really like him.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.283
Just so you know,
when you reach six "reallys,"

18:05.285 --> 18:07.852
you're technically supposed
to switch over to "love."

18:07.854 --> 18:10.822
And you're only two away.

18:20.799 --> 18:23.134
(knock on door)

18:23.136 --> 18:26.337
(David)
Come in.

18:39.852 --> 18:44.956
Good luck trying to talk
your way out of this one.

19:03.575 --> 19:08.045
Okay, so, uh...

19:08.047 --> 19:11.048
I'll talk to Carter today.

19:16.855 --> 19:18.923
How about this?

19:18.925 --> 19:22.627
We'll talk to Carter together.

19:40.379 --> 19:42.713
(knock on door)

19:47.786 --> 19:49.587
Hey, sleepyhead.
Time to get up.

19:49.589 --> 19:51.589
Five more minutes.

19:51.591 --> 19:52.223
Uh-uh.

19:52.225 --> 19:55.560
You already had
an extra hour.

19:56.461 --> 19:57.795
Oh crap, I'm late.

19:57.797 --> 20:00.765
Shh.
No, no, no.

20:00.767 --> 20:04.969
You're not going
to school today.

20:04.971 --> 20:05.770
Why?

20:05.772 --> 20:10.608
How about we talk about that
over breakfast, okay?

20:10.610 --> 20:13.077
Okay.

20:45.110 --> 20:47.845
So you'd already written it.

20:47.847 --> 20:49.614
Yes.

20:49.616 --> 20:56.487
And that whole speech about
fatherly truth telling...

20:56.489 --> 20:59.123
that was a lie?

21:05.731 --> 21:08.499
Yes.

21:10.235 --> 21:13.304
What are the red marks?

21:15.674 --> 21:19.543
My editor made those.

21:25.317 --> 21:26.851
Have you read this?

21:26.853 --> 21:29.053
Just yesterday.

21:33.792 --> 21:36.761
How was it going
to work, exactly?

21:40.165 --> 21:45.436
Were you just gonna pretend
to talk it through with me,

21:45.438 --> 21:46.470
and then show me chapters

21:46.472 --> 21:50.541
that had already been
written and edited?

21:55.013 --> 21:58.382
I hadn't worked it out.

22:00.519 --> 22:02.286
Carter, I needed this book.

22:02.288 --> 22:05.156
For my family, for me.

22:05.158 --> 22:11.362
I kept thinking it would all
work out, but I was wrong.

22:15.300 --> 22:18.803
I never would have published it
without your permission.

22:23.608 --> 22:26.644
I don't believe you.

22:39.758 --> 22:42.727
"She had a tornado-like quality
in our lives from day one.

22:42.729 --> 22:47.198
"Within 24 hours of meeting her
prim and proper twin sister,

22:47.200 --> 22:50.368
"Carter had gotten Taylor
drunk and stoned,

22:50.370 --> 22:52.002
and stolen her boyfriend."

22:52.004 --> 22:53.971
See, and he knows that's
not what happened.

22:53.973 --> 22:58.075
Okay, he calls Max
"a stoner with a slow tongue

22:58.077 --> 22:59.877
and an even slower brain."

22:59.879 --> 23:02.813
How can anyone be mean
about Max?

23:02.815 --> 23:04.115
Yes!

23:06.952 --> 23:09.887
They won.
Oh, thank you, God.

23:09.889 --> 23:12.656
Do you realize
what this means?

23:12.658 --> 23:13.958
I don't owe the money anymore.

23:13.960 --> 23:17.194
The guy now owes me.
Call Crash.

23:21.032 --> 23:22.833
It's just going straight
to voicemail.

23:22.835 --> 23:26.470
I'm out of the hole.
You don't seem happy for me.

23:26.472 --> 23:29.039
What?
Oh, yes.

23:29.041 --> 23:30.841
(woman over intercom)
<i>Beatrix?</i>

23:30.843 --> 23:33.544
<i>Beatrix, can you hear me?</i>

23:33.546 --> 23:35.212
(mouthing words)

23:35.214 --> 23:36.914
Yes, Mom, I can hear you.

23:36.916 --> 23:39.817
<i>I need you in the house.</i>
Okay.

23:39.819 --> 23:40.451
(beep)

23:40.453 --> 23:43.521
God forbid she actually come
down here and meet my friends.

23:43.523 --> 23:45.089
It's been eight months.

23:45.091 --> 23:47.057
You'd think they'd be curious
about my life.

23:47.059 --> 23:48.292
(beep)
<i>Now, Beatrix.</i>

23:48.294 --> 23:49.560
I'm coming.
(beep)

23:49.562 --> 23:53.597
Just hang here, okay?

23:53.599 --> 23:58.035
(hip-hop music playing)

23:58.037 --> 24:00.037
(knocking on door)
Taylor?

24:00.039 --> 24:02.406
(gasps)

24:06.445 --> 24:09.880
I'm sorry.
This is, this is bad.

24:09.882 --> 24:10.848
No. No, it's not.

24:10.850 --> 24:12.516
I'm sorry to have to
see me like this.

24:12.518 --> 24:14.652
I'm sorry about yesterday.

24:14.654 --> 24:17.621
I'm glad you're here.

24:17.623 --> 24:21.192
I like you like this.

24:25.230 --> 24:28.199
Should I change the music?
No.

24:28.201 --> 24:30.000
No.

24:31.436 --> 24:34.672
I should brush my teeth.
No.

24:35.440 --> 24:39.376
This isn't perfect.

24:39.378 --> 24:43.080
Yes, it is.

24:44.049 --> 24:48.185
I really like you.

24:48.187 --> 24:51.522
I really like you.

24:51.524 --> 24:57.595
I mean, I really, really...

24:58.897 --> 25:00.531
really...

25:03.768 --> 25:10.040
really, really like you.

25:21.119 --> 25:24.889
That's five.

25:24.891 --> 25:28.058
One more to go.

25:28.060 --> 25:30.828
And then what?

25:36.968 --> 25:38.469
Crash still isn't answering
his phone.

25:38.471 --> 25:40.671
(woman on intercom) <i>Hello?</i>
Yes?

25:40.673 --> 25:43.541
<i>Carter Stevens?</i>
<i>Is Carter Stevens there?</i>

25:43.543 --> 25:45.843
She is.
Yeah. Hi.

25:45.845 --> 25:48.946
<i>Come up to the house,</i>
<i>please.</i>

25:48.948 --> 25:50.848
Okay, I'll be right there.

25:50.850 --> 25:52.516
(intercom beeps)

25:53.919 --> 25:56.253
They won.

25:58.657 --> 26:01.926
You ain't breaking
my legs, man.

26:07.265 --> 26:10.601
(police radio droning)

26:16.141 --> 26:20.377
Beatrix, this is the friend
you referred to?

26:20.379 --> 26:22.613
Yes.

26:22.615 --> 26:23.213
What's going on?

26:23.215 --> 26:24.882
Carter, I'm
Beatrix's mother.

26:24.884 --> 26:28.152
I believe you have
a necklace of mine.

26:28.154 --> 26:31.055
Um, no, I don't.

26:31.057 --> 26:32.489
No?

26:32.491 --> 26:35.626
But you're wearing
my bracelet.

26:38.597 --> 26:39.897
She gave this to me.

26:39.899 --> 26:43.167
Did you give that to her?
No.

26:43.169 --> 26:45.703
Sorry, Carter.
Hands behind your back, please.

26:45.705 --> 26:47.104
What?
You're arresting me?

26:47.106 --> 26:48.439
Hands before your back,
please.

26:48.441 --> 26:51.675
Carter Stevens,
you're being charged

26:51.677 --> 26:53.344
with grand larceny.

26:53.346 --> 26:56.213
Bird, tell them.

26:56.215 --> 26:59.149
Come on.
You--

27:12.897 --> 27:14.765
Where are the cookies
I made?

27:14.767 --> 27:17.668
Mom, they sold out
first thing.

27:17.670 --> 27:20.070
People loved them.
Really?

27:20.072 --> 27:22.373
Yeah, Mom, you were the hit
of the bake sale.

27:22.375 --> 27:24.708
Come here.

27:27.145 --> 27:29.546
Excuse me.
Is this your phone?

27:29.548 --> 27:30.147
Oh yeah, thanks.

27:30.149 --> 27:32.383
We ask our parent volunteers
to silence their phones

27:32.385 --> 27:35.486
in hopes that you care enough
about your child's school

27:35.488 --> 27:37.354
to give it
two hours of your time.

27:37.356 --> 27:38.956
Of course.
I am so sorry.

27:38.958 --> 27:41.025
Also your daughter's
in jail.

27:41.027 --> 27:42.493
What?
(phone chimes)

27:42.495 --> 27:44.928
That was happening a lot.

27:44.930 --> 27:46.397
Mom, go.

27:46.399 --> 27:48.132
Yeah.

27:52.070 --> 27:56.540
Elizabeth, check your messages.
Just get down here, okay?

27:56.542 --> 28:01.478
Now.
It's about Carter.

28:02.714 --> 28:04.114
Kyle.
David.

28:04.116 --> 28:06.316
Why don't you have the basic
kindness to steer clear

28:06.318 --> 28:07.017
of our family issues?

28:07.019 --> 28:07.985
I'm actually
doing you a favor.

28:07.987 --> 28:10.120
Your daughter doesn't have
a lot of friends down here,

28:10.122 --> 28:11.555
as I'm sure you know.

28:11.557 --> 28:12.489
Where is she?

28:12.491 --> 28:13.390
We have her in a cell.

28:13.392 --> 28:15.125
In a cell.
That's your idea of a favor?

28:15.127 --> 28:18.529
She's accused of stealing over
$100,000 worth of jewelry.

28:18.531 --> 28:20.330
A cell was pretty unavoidable.

28:20.332 --> 28:22.266
$100,000?
That's ridiculous.

28:22.268 --> 28:25.002
She buys leather bracelets
at flea markets.

28:25.004 --> 28:26.537
That kid doesn't own
$100 worth of jewelry.

28:26.539 --> 28:30.207
At the time of her arrest, she
was wearing a $20,000 bracelet.

28:30.209 --> 28:31.508
She was?
Mm-hmm.

28:31.510 --> 28:32.943
Do you have a good
criminal attorney?

28:32.945 --> 28:34.445
'Cause I can give you
a few names.

28:34.447 --> 28:35.412
I mean, you gotta
be prepared.

28:35.414 --> 28:38.215
A case like this?
Take it to trial?

28:38.217 --> 28:40.250
It could wipe you out
financially.

28:40.252 --> 28:43.053
Thanks, that's helpful
to point that out

28:43.055 --> 28:44.822
at time like this, too.

28:44.824 --> 28:46.824
Tell me how much worse
it could get.

28:46.826 --> 28:49.326
I know you think
this is personal.

28:49.328 --> 28:50.627
This is not personal.

28:50.629 --> 28:53.363
Of course it's not.
Can I see Carter?

28:53.365 --> 28:54.098
Where is she?

28:54.100 --> 28:55.365
Yeah, we both want
to see her.

28:55.367 --> 28:56.734
No, not together.

28:56.736 --> 28:58.602
Can you give us
a second, Kyle?

28:58.604 --> 29:00.270
Yeah.

29:00.272 --> 29:01.371
Uhh-uh...

29:01.373 --> 29:04.041
Our daughter's in a jail cell.
Can we not do this...

29:04.043 --> 29:05.209
I don't want her to think
that you're just

29:05.211 --> 29:08.011
gathering more material for
another chapter in your book.

29:08.013 --> 29:09.613
The longer we have
this conversation,

29:09.615 --> 29:10.681
the longer she
sits alone.

29:10.683 --> 29:12.516
I just don't trust you
with her.

29:12.518 --> 29:15.119
You don't trust me.
Uh-uh.

29:15.121 --> 29:16.553
You trust her?
Why wouldn't I?

29:16.555 --> 29:18.388
She was arrested
and charged for stealing

29:18.390 --> 29:20.691
over $100,000 worth
of jewelry.

29:20.693 --> 29:21.492
That she would never do.

29:21.494 --> 29:23.093
She was wearing
some at the time.

29:23.095 --> 29:23.927
Well, there's an explanation.

29:23.929 --> 29:26.597
Maybe she <i>was</i> planning
to run away with Lori,

29:26.599 --> 29:28.031
and they would need money,
and this would be

29:28.033 --> 29:30.501
something they could pawn,
or maybe it's Crash.

29:30.503 --> 29:32.970
Would you just stop this?
This isn't who she is.

29:32.972 --> 29:35.272
I don't want this to be true
any more than you,

29:35.274 --> 29:38.408
but talk to Kyle.
Kyle.

29:38.410 --> 29:38.876
Yeah?

29:38.878 --> 29:41.779
Could you just tell me
what this looks like?

29:41.781 --> 29:42.412
It's bad.

29:42.414 --> 29:45.582
Her friend Bird is ready
to testify against her.

29:53.658 --> 29:55.826
I just need to figure out
a way to fix this.

29:55.828 --> 29:58.162
Why don't you go in there
and admit that you lied?

29:58.164 --> 29:59.496
No, I can't do that, okay?

29:59.498 --> 30:02.099
My parents are barely
in my life as it is.

30:02.101 --> 30:05.169
They're just looking for
an excuse to forget I exist.

30:05.171 --> 30:08.038
They're already disappointed
they can't ship me off to rehab

30:08.040 --> 30:10.274
like their friends do
with their kids.

30:10.276 --> 30:12.309
Well, unless you step up,

30:12.311 --> 30:14.611
Carter's probably looking
at prison time.

30:14.613 --> 30:16.747
What the hell are you
talking about?

30:16.749 --> 30:19.416
What happened?
Where's Carter?

30:19.418 --> 30:21.385
It's a long story,
but the short answer is

30:21.387 --> 30:23.887
a cell at the Fairfax
police precinct.

30:23.889 --> 30:24.855
Please don't freak out.

30:24.857 --> 30:27.224
If you just give back the
necklace, this will all be over.

30:27.226 --> 30:29.359
The necklace that you
told me to pawn?

30:29.361 --> 30:30.694
I got 20 grand for it.

30:30.696 --> 30:31.728
It's worth 100.

30:31.730 --> 30:33.063
Okay, so then I did
pretty well then.

30:33.065 --> 30:34.832
Can you just get back
the necklace?

30:34.834 --> 30:35.999
I thought you needed
the money.

30:36.001 --> 30:37.701
Not anymore.
They won.

30:37.703 --> 30:40.704
Look, all you have to do is
get back the necklace

30:40.706 --> 30:43.674
and my mom will drop all
the charges against Carter.

30:43.676 --> 30:44.274
How about this?

30:44.276 --> 30:46.410
You get your mom to drop the
charges against Carter first,

30:46.412 --> 30:48.245
and then I'll get you back
the necklace.

30:48.247 --> 30:53.283
Crash, now really isn't the time
to start developing morals.

30:54.619 --> 30:58.255
What happened to yours?

31:00.792 --> 31:02.326
(door buzzer)

31:03.328 --> 31:06.363
Oh, my God.
Can we go now, please?

31:06.365 --> 31:08.565
I'll let you know
about bail.

31:08.567 --> 31:12.402
Your father's looking into
some criminal attorneys.

31:12.404 --> 31:13.203
We have some names.

31:13.205 --> 31:14.938
Why do I need
a criminal attorney?

31:14.940 --> 31:15.906
I didn't do anything.

31:15.908 --> 31:17.741
You know your friend Bird
is ready

31:17.743 --> 31:19.443
to testify against you?

31:19.445 --> 31:22.946
Obviously not my friend Bird.

31:31.256 --> 31:36.059
Don't be mad at me, but did
Crash put you up to this?

31:36.061 --> 31:40.163
You know what, I actually am
mad at you for asking that.

31:40.165 --> 31:42.966
You don't think he had anything
to do with this, do you?

31:42.968 --> 31:45.269
Right now, I don't know
what to think.

31:46.137 --> 31:47.704
You don't know what
to think about me.

31:47.706 --> 31:51.041
Well, thank you very much
for the vote of confidence.

31:51.043 --> 31:52.376
I don't want to believe
that you have

31:52.378 --> 31:53.243
anything to do with this,

31:53.245 --> 31:55.412
but I can't say the same thing
about Crash.

31:55.414 --> 31:56.680
This is not about Crash.

31:56.682 --> 31:57.714
This is about me.

31:57.716 --> 31:59.116
No, if he was involved in it

31:59.118 --> 32:03.020
and you knew about it,
then you are an accessory.

32:04.856 --> 32:06.657
And what would happen to me?

32:09.594 --> 32:12.930
Now I do think that I need to
talk to a criminal attorney--

32:12.932 --> 32:14.364
Can't you just go out there
and talk to them

32:14.366 --> 32:15.532
and convince them
to let me go?

32:15.534 --> 32:18.568
I will, as soon as
they set your bail.

32:20.772 --> 32:23.740
Well, I can tell you
who took the necklace.

32:23.742 --> 32:25.909
That would be lovely.
Who?

32:25.911 --> 32:28.745
Bird. She said her mom had
a closet full of jewelry

32:28.747 --> 32:30.180
and she would never,
ever miss it.

32:30.182 --> 32:32.449
Do you know why she took it?
Do you know where it is?

32:32.451 --> 32:34.184
All right, now you're
just interrogating me.

32:34.186 --> 32:38.989
You can't stop being a cop
even for five seconds, can you?

32:41.526 --> 32:44.094
You know what, between you
and your husband,

32:44.096 --> 32:48.899
I... think I might actually
be better off in here.

32:57.041 --> 32:59.810
Just downplay it
so she doesn't get

32:59.812 --> 33:03.013
too upset about Carter, okay?
Okay.

33:04.115 --> 33:05.582
Oh, no.

33:07.552 --> 33:08.485
Later.

33:08.487 --> 33:12.122
Uh, we'll just
talk to her later.

33:21.199 --> 33:22.666
I'm just leaving.

33:22.668 --> 33:26.570
Sorry about earlier.
Yeah, me too.

33:31.509 --> 33:32.976
Six reallys.

33:32.978 --> 33:35.245
Six reallys.

33:38.516 --> 33:43.854
I didn't realize that you
and Max were so... close.

33:43.856 --> 33:44.821
Yeah.

33:44.823 --> 33:45.355
Where's Carter?

33:45.357 --> 33:47.157
I thought you said
you were going to go get her.

33:47.159 --> 33:49.659
Still in jail.
Jail?
For what?

33:49.661 --> 33:52.963
Apparently she stole some
of Bird's mother's jewelry.

33:52.965 --> 33:54.698
(snickers)
No, she did not.

33:54.700 --> 33:55.899
Says who?
Bird, for one.

33:55.901 --> 33:58.869
Bird is a sad and lonely girl
who's been jealous of Carter

33:58.871 --> 34:00.303
since the day they met.

34:00.305 --> 34:01.304
Have you talked to her?

34:01.306 --> 34:03.106
Have I? No.
The cops have.

34:03.108 --> 34:04.775
You are a cop.

34:04.777 --> 34:06.476
Not at the moment.

34:06.478 --> 34:08.078
Mom, you're always a cop.

34:08.080 --> 34:10.647
Go talk to her.
She will crack so fast.

34:10.649 --> 34:12.783
There's no way she can
look you in the eye and say

34:12.785 --> 34:14.251
that Carter stole
that jewelry.

34:14.253 --> 34:17.220
But, Taylor, the problem is
that Carter knows where it is,

34:17.222 --> 34:19.122
or at least
what happened to it.

34:19.124 --> 34:21.658
So what?
It makes her an accessory.

34:21.660 --> 34:24.194
Well, at least bail her out.

34:24.196 --> 34:26.096
(knock on door)

34:26.098 --> 34:27.497
Now what?

34:32.904 --> 34:34.004
(woman)
May we come in?

34:34.006 --> 34:36.773
(Elizabeth)
Sure.

34:40.711 --> 34:45.749
Beatrix...
say what you came to say.

34:47.018 --> 34:52.689
Um. Mr. and Mrs. Wilson...

34:52.691 --> 34:55.158
I've done a terrible
thing.

34:55.160 --> 34:58.929
And I only hope
that you and Carter

34:58.931 --> 35:02.132
and the rest of your family
can forgive me.

35:02.134 --> 35:04.668
It seems <i>my</i> daughter stole
my necklace

35:04.670 --> 35:05.502
and blamed your daughter.

35:05.504 --> 35:07.471
I've dropped all charges
against Carter.

35:07.473 --> 35:09.072
See, I knew it.
I told you.

35:09.074 --> 35:10.574
That is exactly what I said.

35:10.576 --> 35:11.808
You never listen to me.

35:11.810 --> 35:15.412
You were right.
I was wrong.

35:15.414 --> 35:16.813
<i>We</i> were wrong.

35:16.815 --> 35:21.485
Now I'm going to the station
to pick up our daughter.

35:21.487 --> 35:23.353
Excuse me.

35:27.525 --> 35:29.626
How could this happen?
I don't understand.

35:29.628 --> 35:31.528
Hey.
I was just going to call you.

35:31.530 --> 35:33.029
I know, they're
dropping the charges.

35:33.031 --> 35:34.998
I'm here to pick up--
No, Liz.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.868
That's why I was going
to call you.

35:37.870 --> 35:39.102
Carter's not here.

35:39.104 --> 35:39.703
Is she in the cell?

35:39.705 --> 35:43.507
I just went down there
to tell her the good news.

35:43.509 --> 35:45.041
She's gone.

35:45.043 --> 35:47.711
Kyle, where is she?

35:52.550 --> 35:53.116
Crash came by.

35:53.118 --> 35:56.186
Some idiot clerk allowed him
to post bail for her.

35:56.188 --> 35:58.088
No, that's impossible.
She's a minor.

35:58.090 --> 35:59.322
They can't.
I know.

35:59.324 --> 36:01.791
But they did.
When was this?

36:01.793 --> 36:05.929
I don't know.
Maybe any hour ago.

36:05.931 --> 36:06.997
Elizabeth, I'm sorry.

36:06.999 --> 36:08.398
You let her go with him?

36:08.400 --> 36:09.199
She left with him?

36:09.201 --> 36:11.968
It wasn't me--
How could you do that?

36:11.970 --> 36:17.007
I just got her back.
And now she's gone?

36:21.078 --> 36:24.114
She's gone.
