WEBVTT

04:34.275 --> 04:35.827
What are you wearing Portia?

04:36.965 --> 04:38.448
Whatever Zay likes.

04:45.034 --> 04:45.827
Here you go!

04:46.620 --> 04:47.586
What Jackie?

04:47.620 --> 04:49.620
That man don't want you.

04:49.655 --> 04:51.000
He doesn't know what he wants.

04:51.034 --> 04:52.793
He knows he doesn't want you.

04:52.827 --> 04:53.448
See.

05:02.931 --> 05:05.000
How long have you
known Zay, Portia?

05:05.034 --> 05:05.965
Oh, wow!

05:06.000 --> 05:08.862
Come on man, come on. Crazy!

05:14.034 --> 05:15.827
I don't want that man.

05:15.862 --> 05:17.482
I'm not doing this with you.

05:17.517 --> 05:18.551
Yeah. Come on, yes

05:18.586 --> 05:19.517
I'm not doing this.

05:19.551 --> 05:21.034
How long, tell me. Do it.

05:21.068 --> 05:23.103
I'm not doing this with
you. I'm not doing this.

05:23.137 --> 05:23.965
Do it.

05:25.620 --> 05:26.862
Since middle school.

05:26.896 --> 05:30.034
Okay, here we are
now in college,

05:30.068 --> 05:34.551
and he hasn't asked you
on a date, kiss you,

05:34.586 --> 05:36.379
said he saw he's
more than a friend.

05:37.896 --> 05:40.000
I mean no, but like.

05:40.034 --> 05:41.827
Okay, then my case
here is closed.

05:45.068 --> 05:46.517
Oh, Portia!

05:46.551 --> 05:48.137
I don't know what it is,
nobody like that girl.

05:48.172 --> 05:50.965
What? She bad though.
Is she persistent?

05:51.000 --> 05:52.137
Persistent.

05:52.172 --> 05:53.517
Oh, that's what you
call her? Persistent?

05:53.551 --> 05:56.379
Look man that girl love you.
Cool.

05:56.413 --> 05:58.620
And no matter what you do
she's still here that's
called loyalty my boy.

05:58.655 --> 05:59.413
Loyalty.

06:02.172 --> 06:05.448
Man, whatever! Craig, what you
think? Tell me what you think?

06:05.482 --> 06:07.758
I mean look she a little
high maintenance, but.

06:07.793 --> 06:09.448
She good for you bro.

06:09.482 --> 06:11.758
She ain't nothing too crazy
for you. Crazy about you.

06:11.793 --> 06:13.448
What happened?
Man.

06:13.482 --> 06:16.034
I mean you look at it like
this, if you go to the league,

06:16.068 --> 06:18.034
you ain't gotta worry about
trying to take your prayer
because some momma got

06:18.068 --> 06:19.758
mad money, bro.

06:19.793 --> 06:22.000
See that's the point, right,
baba got bread but she don't.

06:22.034 --> 06:23.724
But look she's always
been like fabulous,

06:23.758 --> 06:25.517
man, would y'all want me
date my sister or something?

06:25.551 --> 06:25.965
Yep.

06:27.241 --> 06:28.896
Whatever man, let's go.

06:29.896 --> 06:33.965
Like I said he doesn't
know what he wants.

06:39.793 --> 06:41.931
You know you want Portia there.

06:41.965 --> 06:44.655
Why are you talking about
her? Talk about some business.

06:44.689 --> 06:47.586
I mean, man, if you
feeling Portia, you feeling
Portia. Whatever man.

06:47.620 --> 06:49.724
I know who I'm
feeling. She pretty.

06:49.758 --> 06:51.034
Yeah, your mama pretty too.

06:51.068 --> 06:53.206
Oh, he gotta go
with the mama jokes.

06:53.241 --> 06:55.620
Oh, I believe so early anyway.

06:55.655 --> 06:58.551
You already know why we
leave me early, so I get
some of these new girls,

06:58.586 --> 07:00.758
new girls.

07:00.793 --> 07:02.793
And you know I'm surprised
y'all wanting to go
to the trailer anyway.

07:02.827 --> 07:03.931
What you mean?

07:03.965 --> 07:04.620
What?

07:06.931 --> 07:08.000
You know I mean the girls
want to be scared out
there tonight. I know,

07:08.034 --> 07:08.586
that's what I know.
Oh. That's what we went on a man

07:08.620 --> 07:10.275
like me. Man, exactly.

07:10.310 --> 07:12.586
And you want to keep
coming out to the Portia,

07:12.620 --> 07:15.551
we ain't got no time
for that. Finally, said
y'all boys agree on.

07:15.586 --> 07:16.655
Of course.

07:16.689 --> 07:17.827
Hold on.

07:17.862 --> 07:19.137
I also said meet up at night.

07:22.862 --> 07:26.620
Yes, sir, we are on for now.

07:27.689 --> 07:28.586
Oh, we're going to attend.

07:28.620 --> 07:29.689
It is.

07:30.655 --> 07:32.689
Only on that free time.

07:32.724 --> 07:35.689
Exactly. Let's not
forget your complexion.

07:35.724 --> 07:39.620
Right. So, I'm supposed
to be walking some trail.

07:39.655 --> 07:41.862
I told you a thousand
times, Jordan.

07:41.896 --> 07:43.689
It's a haunted trail.

07:43.724 --> 07:45.103
It's like a haunted
house but you're just
going through the woods.

07:45.137 --> 07:46.827
Bro, I bet that shit
ain't even scary.

07:46.862 --> 07:49.137
Well, I'm tired of doing the
same damn things, alright.

07:49.172 --> 07:51.517
If you don't want to come
with us and be a part
of the Halloween spirit

07:51.551 --> 07:53.206
then just stay your ass home.
Chill.

07:53.241 --> 07:56.034
No, bruh! Cause you always got
something to complain about.

07:56.068 --> 07:59.034
Bro, complain? Bro, I wasn't
complaining. I was working
your mom's last night.

07:59.068 --> 08:01.620
Shut up. Just shut up.
Hey, guys!

08:04.103 --> 08:05.793
Bro, what the fuck!

08:05.827 --> 08:07.793
Bro, you got problems man.

08:07.827 --> 08:10.586
Well, I went on this trail
last year with some teammates

08:10.620 --> 08:11.827
and it's actually really fun.

08:11.862 --> 08:13.724
Bro whatever, Amy.

08:13.758 --> 08:15.896
I'm serious. In fact, how'd
you even get us a reservation?

08:15.931 --> 08:19.068
Last year, it took us like
hours. I know the owner's son.

08:19.103 --> 08:21.310
Owner's son!

08:21.344 --> 08:23.206
You know that man
winning and everything,

08:23.241 --> 08:25.931
you'll never beat him in
there. Every single time.

08:25.965 --> 08:29.068
And I want you to know,
I can't drive either.

08:29.103 --> 08:30.172
Oh, me?

08:30.206 --> 08:32.344
My butt, my head like messed up.

08:32.379 --> 08:34.172
Greg?

08:34.206 --> 08:35.034
He ain't got no car.
You know I ain't got no car.

08:35.068 --> 08:36.034
Stupid fool.
Alright.

08:37.206 --> 08:38.931
Just know we hired
the whole ride.

08:38.965 --> 08:39.724
Yeah.

08:39.758 --> 08:41.103
That's five feet.

08:41.137 --> 08:43.206
Y'all gonna be had.
Hook them away.

08:43.241 --> 08:45.344
Hey, you think you can
spot when we get there.

08:45.379 --> 08:48.586
Greg, I know mommy.
Man, you better spot
your ass in this car.

08:48.620 --> 08:49.862
Oh, man.

08:49.896 --> 08:52.172
Oh my god.

09:05.448 --> 09:07.793
Did you know we're gonna
be running around, right?

09:07.827 --> 09:09.655
For what?

09:09.689 --> 09:11.965
What do you mean for what?
It's a haunted trail.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.379
People jump out of the
woods and chase you.

09:13.413 --> 09:14.379
Chase you?

09:14.413 --> 09:15.793
Yeah.

09:15.827 --> 09:16.965
What did you think
was about to happen?

09:17.000 --> 09:18.689
I don't know. I've
never done this before.

09:18.724 --> 09:21.310
I did it last year and
you were running around.

09:22.965 --> 09:24.931
I mean well, was
it actually scary?

09:24.965 --> 09:26.758
Hell, yeah. It was scary.

09:27.965 --> 09:30.206
Maybe Zay will hold my hand.

09:30.241 --> 09:31.206
You need help.

09:31.241 --> 09:32.206
No, I don't.

09:32.241 --> 09:33.965
Change your shoes, Portia.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
Why if I can run in them? Look
the heels are thick. I'm good.

09:37.793 --> 09:38.862
Change your shoes.

09:38.896 --> 09:40.379
Why if I can run in them.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.103
Portia!

09:41.137 --> 09:42.103
Jackie!

09:43.310 --> 09:45.793
Fine. Do what you want.

09:45.827 --> 09:46.931
Let's just go before we're late.

09:46.965 --> 09:48.413
Oh, wait, you need to eat.

09:48.448 --> 09:50.103
I'm not hungry.

09:50.137 --> 09:52.068
Didn't you just say we're
gonna be running around.

09:52.103 --> 09:54.241
If you go into diabetic
shock or something,

09:54.275 --> 09:55.827
that's not going to be on me.

09:55.862 --> 09:58.137
Wow! You're such a great friend.

09:58.172 --> 09:59.413
The best.

09:59.448 --> 10:01.689
Oh, dope earrings.
Are they real?

10:01.724 --> 10:04.413
Jackie, have I ever
worn anything fake?

10:04.448 --> 10:06.275
Yeah. Yeah.
Exactly. Come on.

10:06.310 --> 10:08.793
When's the last time
you actually paid for
a speeding ticket?

10:08.827 --> 10:11.241
Mr.! My dad is a judge,
can get me out of anything.

10:11.275 --> 10:13.965
Hold on. Hold on. It was
only two or three times.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.241
About two or three times. But
let's try five in the past year.

10:17.275 --> 10:18.896
But how many of those
did you pay for?

10:18.931 --> 10:21.068
Oh, leave me alone.

10:21.103 --> 10:23.241
Bruh, chill!
Also, we just playing a little.

10:23.275 --> 10:24.655
Yeah whatever, man!

10:24.689 --> 10:25.137
Gosh!

10:27.068 --> 10:28.379
You're driving, right.

10:30.034 --> 10:31.068
Don't I always drive?

10:31.103 --> 10:32.758
Yeah. Okay.

10:54.275 --> 10:56.103
Bitch, I got it. Bitch,
I get on my shit.

10:56.137 --> 10:57.655
She gonna be strange or what?

10:59.275 --> 11:01.034
Hold on. Hold on.

11:01.068 --> 11:03.034
She's coming in with
a big bun. Big pops.

11:03.068 --> 11:05.000
She gonna be like, yes, no.

11:06.068 --> 11:07.724
Oh, man!
Enough.

11:07.758 --> 11:09.310
Bruh, what's wrong with you?

11:11.344 --> 11:13.724
I've been a damn.

11:13.758 --> 11:15.448
Man, you too have followed
crazy stuff. Bitch
ain't got time for it.

11:17.896 --> 11:19.034
Exactly. You fool.

11:19.068 --> 11:20.482
You got the girl smoked up.

11:20.517 --> 11:21.310
We here?

11:21.344 --> 11:22.000
We here.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.965
With the grace of me.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.344
With the grace of nothing.

11:29.758 --> 11:32.206
Yo! This place is
a little empty.

11:32.241 --> 11:34.862
There were more
people here last time.

11:36.206 --> 11:37.896
I thought you said it
was hard to get in here.

11:37.931 --> 11:39.896
Well, I don't know,
maybe we're late.

11:39.931 --> 11:43.034
Well, Mark said he
gave us the last slide.
So, we should be fine.

11:43.068 --> 11:44.344
This shit better be scary.

11:44.379 --> 11:46.137
You come here for
the ladies, man.

11:46.172 --> 11:47.689
But I still wanna be hang.

11:49.896 --> 11:52.724
Okay, neither of you have been
here. So, I don't know what.

11:52.758 --> 11:56.172
I mean yeah, it could be scary
but it ain't that bad I'm sure.

11:56.206 --> 11:58.827
All I know is this shit
better be worth my money.

11:58.862 --> 11:59.931
It's definitely worth the money.

12:01.172 --> 12:02.931
We're paying people to scare us.
Yes.

12:04.241 --> 12:05.551
But it's totally
worth it. It's fun.

12:05.586 --> 12:07.413
It's about to be lit. Okay!

12:07.448 --> 12:09.068
Better be lit.

12:09.103 --> 12:11.241
Come on. We gonna see.
Alright, y'all, let's go.

12:13.517 --> 12:15.034
Oh shit!

12:15.068 --> 12:19.379
You guys have fun.

12:19.413 --> 12:22.206
Oh my god, Jackie.
Jackie, do not.

12:22.896 --> 12:24.241
But she's a part of the act.

12:24.620 --> 12:26.241
Whatever.

12:26.275 --> 12:27.413
Look man, let's just
go man, come on, man.

12:27.448 --> 12:30.137
Hold on. Let me
finish my weed first.

12:30.172 --> 12:33.551
All these girls, and you're
worrying about some damn weed.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.172
That's the problem right there.

12:36.206 --> 12:37.413
Wait. Wait. Wait.

12:37.448 --> 12:40.172
No, you hanging with this.
God, damn.

12:40.206 --> 12:41.931
Imma stay here in the woods.

12:41.965 --> 12:44.896
Yeah, man. I'm going where the
women is. That's your problem.

12:44.931 --> 12:46.068
I'm going where the fish is.

12:46.103 --> 12:49.241
I do what I do best.
Ladies. Ladies!

12:49.275 --> 12:53.310
Man, would you...Okay,

12:53.344 --> 12:55.000

Deep breaths. Deep breaths.

13:03.034 --> 13:03.965
Hey, Zay!

13:04.000 --> 13:05.275
Hi!

Good game last week.
Oh, yeah.

13:06.655 --> 13:08.241
I don't know what
we'd do without you.

13:08.275 --> 13:09.310
Oh, is that right?

13:09.344 --> 13:10.310
See you in science.

13:10.344 --> 13:12.344
Yeah, what's up.
Cute.

Alright, let's do this.
Let's start with that.

13:41.655 --> 13:44.275
Let me get my bag.
Leave your back.

13:45.655 --> 13:47.172
You want me to leave this bag?

13:47.206 --> 13:47.620
Yes.

13:47.655 --> 13:48.275

19:46.275 --> 19:47.206
Perfect.

19:49.758 --> 19:52.724
Wait, there's only
seven of you here.

19:52.758 --> 19:54.931
We need all nine

19:54.965 --> 19:57.758
Oh, yeah. My buddy, they

19:57.793 --> 20:00.689

20:01.413 --> 20:05.448
Okay. Well, I'm Sarah.
Hi.

20:05.482 --> 20:08.862
I'm going to go over some things
with you before you go in.

20:08.896 --> 20:11.758
First if you have
never been here before,

20:11.793 --> 20:14.000
we don't allow
phones on the trail.

20:14.034 --> 20:16.241
Oh, no, come on. Jackie,
you didn't tell me that.

20:16.275 --> 20:18.241
Yeah, she.

20:18.275 --> 20:19.517
You ain't saying none of that.
I honestly forgot about that.

20:21.413 --> 20:22.344
Well, somebody tried to come
get it what we're gonna do.

20:22.379 --> 20:24.689
I know it may seems
like a strange request.

20:24.724 --> 20:25.896
Wow.

20:25.931 --> 20:28.862
Kinda. Our customers
have the best experience

20:28.896 --> 20:31.241
when they don't
bring their phones.

20:31.275 --> 20:35.758
This way, you are fully
present and you can
experience all of them real.

20:35.793 --> 20:37.448
Oh, you just gonna
drop the hand.

20:37.482 --> 20:41.724
So, you could all put
your phones in this tray.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.379
I'm ready for this.

20:45.793 --> 20:48.896
So, tray will be locked and
placed at the end of the trail,

20:48.931 --> 20:51.620
just fine lock box laboratory.

20:55.275 --> 20:59.482
And who want to keep the keys?

20:59.517 --> 21:03.034
Oh, do you?
Thank you.

21:03.068 --> 21:07.655
So, before we get
started, I have to ask
you some weak questions.

21:07.689 --> 21:08.482
Please.

21:08.517 --> 21:10.793
Does anyone have asthma?

21:10.827 --> 21:11.689
No.

21:12.827 --> 21:14.586
Does anyone have heart disease?

21:14.620 --> 21:16.620
No. No. No. No.

21:16.655 --> 21:18.068
Is anyone pregnant?

21:18.103 --> 21:19.965
Not yet.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.793
That's it. Okay, awesome.

21:22.827 --> 21:25.793
So, once you get to the
end of the trail, don't
forget to find your lock

21:25.827 --> 21:27.965
box with all of
your cell phones.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.793
There will be also the
signs to lead you back
to the parking lot.

21:31.965 --> 21:33.413
Are you guys ready
to get started?

21:33.448 --> 21:33.965

I don't know.

22:10.172 --> 22:11.517
What is she doing?

22:13.448 --> 22:16.689
You better get that
ugly baby out or I slap

22:29.413 --> 22:32.379
You need to help you.
You need to help my baby.

22:32.413 --> 22:33.724

thanked you or that baby.

22:33.758 --> 22:35.413
Please help, help.

22:35.448 --> 22:37.068

29:44.931 --> 29:46.275
I don't give a fuck.
Alright.

29:46.310 --> 29:48.310
Not going with y'all.

29:50.310 --> 29:52.137
That's a clown house.

29:52.172 --> 29:54.068
I don't do clowns.

29:54.103 --> 29:55.275
Wait, you're the clown.

29:55.310 --> 29:57.586
Yes sir, that was lit. Yes.

29:57.620 --> 29:58.482
Yes sir.

30:01.517 --> 30:02.241
This one.

30:02.275 --> 30:03.482
No.
Yeah.

30:07.103 --> 30:09.931
Y'all trynna suck the fuck
out of everything. I'll trynna
suck the fun out of something.

30:09.965 --> 30:11.931
Yo what?

30:11.965 --> 30:15.482
Get out of here.

30:20.206 --> 30:22.172
What's up with Zay and Portia?

30:22.206 --> 30:25.517
I don't know. He used to
be like her best friend
a couple years ago.

30:27.172 --> 30:29.103
What happened? I mean I've heard
bits and pieces of the story.

30:29.137 --> 30:31.620
Well, our senior
year, he was just

30:31.655 --> 30:34.034
dating this chick that just

30:34.068 --> 30:36.413
wasn't good for him and
everybody knew that Zay was
gonna make it with football.

30:36.448 --> 30:38.965
So, when Portia
tried to tell him,

30:40.931 --> 30:42.448
he thought she couldn't
be happy for him.

30:48.034 --> 30:49.310
Calm down. Stop!

30:53.517 --> 30:56.172
I mean like he knew
the chick wasn't right.

30:56.206 --> 31:00.896
And so, then like Portia just
professed her love and that's
when things kind of went left.

31:02.241 --> 31:03.517
But I mean how can
Zay not like Portia?

31:03.551 --> 31:05.517
I think he just wants to
keep his options open.

31:05.551 --> 31:06.413
So, it's complicated.

31:07.241 --> 31:08.206
Exactly.

31:08.241 --> 31:10.206
Hey.
Oh, shit!

31:12.551 --> 31:14.206
Holy shit!

31:14.241 --> 31:17.206
Hey, I know you're
new to the groove

31:17.241 --> 31:19.034
but I like you Casey.

31:19.068 --> 31:20.172
I like you too, Jackie.

31:30.206 --> 31:31.482
Get off me.

31:31.517 --> 31:35.482
Damn! Look at his face.
How did that happen?

31:35.517 --> 31:37.517
Shut up. Damn!

31:39.724 --> 31:41.206
Alright. That feels great.

31:43.206 --> 31:45.000
Bruh, what about you?

31:45.034 --> 31:47.000
You need to close your mouth.
I don't like the smell.

31:47.034 --> 31:48.000
Crazy.

31:49.551 --> 31:51.034
It's bullshit.
Oh!

32:03.689 --> 32:08.034
I think eventually they're going
to hook up. I mean I can see it.
I'm just like not here for it.

32:08.068 --> 32:09.413
Yeah that seemed
like a lot of drama.

32:09.448 --> 32:11.448
Woah! How was it?

32:11.482 --> 32:13.137
Guys, it was scary.

32:13.172 --> 32:14.137
No, so scary.

32:14.172 --> 32:14.586
Yeah, it was so scary.

32:21.275 --> 32:22.137
Ayo!

32:22.172 --> 32:23.586
Oh god!

32:25.310 --> 32:27.034
Hey, that's what we're talking
about. Merry Christmas!

32:27.068 --> 32:29.689
What? Thank you,
Jesus. Merry Christmas

32:29.724 --> 32:32.103
cause we see no excitement
all fucking days.

32:32.137 --> 32:34.275
Thank you. Let us even see
blood. Can we see blood, please?

32:34.310 --> 32:36.551
Hey, slice them up. Stop.

32:36.586 --> 32:38.586
Playing with them. Hey. Hey,
man, do something to crank
for a little bit of change.

32:41.275 --> 32:43.275
Hey!Get the fuck off me.

32:43.310 --> 32:45.103
I thought they weren't
allowed to touch us.

32:45.137 --> 32:47.965
Oh, baby. Y'all went over this.
This is like excitement, look.

32:50.137 --> 32:52.103
Hey, watch his fucking head off.

32:52.137 --> 32:53.482
I thought they weren't
allowed to touch us.

32:53.517 --> 32:55.275
Yeah, don't worry
about that, okay.

32:55.310 --> 32:58.275
Come on. Let's
not talk about it.

32:58.310 --> 33:01.724
I wanna be scared like
a bitch. Kill him.

33:01.758 --> 33:05.517
Hey, look, watch me.
Watch me. Do this.

33:05.551 --> 33:08.344
Get that motherfucking. Yeah.

33:08.379 --> 33:11.517
Hey. Shut up. Let him do
what he did off of him.
You act like a bitch.

33:15.724 --> 33:17.551
I don't think this is okay.

33:17.586 --> 33:18.689
That's a real knife?

33:18.724 --> 33:21.103
Shit. What the fuck!
Oh, shit.

33:21.137 --> 33:23.551
Come. Come.

33:41.724 --> 33:42.827
Jesus.

33:42.862 --> 33:44.655
That was awesome.
Oh, shit!

33:54.620 --> 33:57.586
Guys, come help me.
Come, help me, guys.

33:57.620 --> 33:59.586
I'm scared. Yeah.
It's too big for that.

33:59.620 --> 34:03.448
I can't believe that's
how you be on the field
too. Oh, yeah. Fuck.

34:03.482 --> 34:07.655
He's, he's, he's a baby.
He's a baby. I'm telling him.
Hey, bro, shut the fuck up.

34:07.689 --> 34:10.448
Oh, now, you big man. Oh, you
should have did that when the
man had you about your neck.

34:10.482 --> 34:11.241
Like that.

34:11.275 --> 34:14.310
Get the fuck off me.

34:14.344 --> 34:17.724
All I know is I need some
more action. I got. Yeah,

Hey, guys, wait up.

35:12.482 --> 35:14.758
Of course, and I'm with
you. I was kind of scared.

35:14.793 --> 35:17.172
Yeah, I know you're scared.

35:17.206 --> 35:18.758
But we're on a haunted trip,
so I mean, right. We're
supposed to be scared here.

35:18.793 --> 35:20.793
Alright, come on, we
gotta go. Come here.

35:24.379 --> 35:25.172
What are you doing?

35:25.965 --> 35:26.689
What do you mean?

35:28.344 --> 35:30.206
What do you mean what do I
mean? You know what I mean.

35:30.241 --> 35:33.172
Bro, I am so tired
of Zay, bro, like.

35:33.206 --> 35:35.172
Bro, he honestly just

35:35.206 --> 35:37.517
That's what your ass thinks.
Bro, for real.

35:37.551 --> 35:39.620
So, you think he was
playing when he took
my damn receiver spot.

35:39.655 --> 35:41.310
One day, you're all over me.

35:41.344 --> 35:43.310
The next day, you want to
act like I don't even exist.

35:43.344 --> 35:46.310
Jackie is convinced you
want nothing to do with me.

35:46.344 --> 35:48.310
Portia, baby, now I
feel about you. I don't.

35:49.689 --> 35:50.724
You really going to
do this right now.

35:51.724 --> 35:53.896
Where else would you
like me to do it, Zay?

35:53.931 --> 35:56.931
I'm telling you, you're
always tripping like damn.

35:58.344 --> 36:00.517
Bro, hold up.

36:00.551 --> 36:02.517
Listen your ankle mess up, bro,
what are you supposed to do?

36:02.551 --> 36:03.965
Turn down the opportunity?

36:04.000 --> 36:05.517
No, that's not what I said.
That's not what I said.

36:05.551 --> 36:06.896
So, what is you saying?

36:06.931 --> 36:09.241
I'm saying I need my
receiver spot back bro.

36:09.275 --> 36:11.241
And my dad, bro, I know
you're gonna be tripping.

36:11.275 --> 36:13.241
Bro, there you go with
your dad again bro.

36:13.275 --> 36:15.241
We were best friends, Zay.

36:15.275 --> 36:17.517
And we still are.
No, we're not.

36:19.931 --> 36:21.689
Your dad gonna cut you out
regardless just like he did
last week during the game.

36:21.724 --> 36:23.620
Coach shouldn't have took
me out the game, bro.

36:23.655 --> 36:25.206
Mark overthrew me
and you know that.

36:26.620 --> 36:28.724
Come on, man.
Bro, whatever you say, Austin.

36:28.758 --> 36:30.551
Wait, hold on. What you trying
to say, Zay better than me?

36:31.827 --> 36:33.344
Bro, I thought you
were Zay's biggest fan.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.034
Hell, nah! I'm just trying to
be a good teammate, that's it.

36:37.068 --> 36:40.034
All I know is bro I'm
trying to win that national
championship this year, bro.

36:40.068 --> 36:42.241
It can't be nothing like
last year when we lost.

36:43.310 --> 36:45.413
We could have won that man.

36:45.448 --> 36:47.896
Once marked through
that interception I
knew, it was over, bro.

36:47.931 --> 36:49.896
But don't worry about
it. Hey, this year,

36:51.758 --> 36:54.793
this year. Yes, sir. Yes,
sir. Yes, sir. I like that.

36:55.551 --> 36:56.448
That's that energy.

37:32.344 --> 37:34.482
Sometimes, things are weird.
Sometimes, they're not.

37:34.517 --> 37:36.827
Okay, damn, what do you
want me to do? Damn,

37:36.862 --> 37:38.931
what you want me to get
on my knee right now? Ask
you to marry me right now?

37:38.965 --> 37:41.620
Nobody, like somebody please
give me a pastor right now,

37:41.655 --> 37:43.413
so I can marry this girl, like
damn what do you want me to do?

37:43.448 --> 37:45.586
I want you to make up your mind,

37:49.068 --> 37:51.310
do you want me or do you not?

37:56.896 --> 38:00.758
Do you know how hard
it is to always see you
entertain another female?

38:08.758 --> 38:10.758
Yeah, forget it.
Oh, come here.

38:12.758 --> 38:13.758
Okay, Portia, look

38:16.034 --> 38:17.689
you remember seeing you in
high school you told me,
a girl was just using me.

38:19.068 --> 38:22.724
What else did you tell
me? What did you tell me?

38:25.724 --> 38:27.724
That I loved you.
Exactly.

38:29.413 --> 38:31.000
And that scared
the hell out of me

38:32.137 --> 38:32.931
look

38:34.586 --> 38:36.413
besides the fact that you're
annoying as hell sometimes,

38:37.413 --> 38:38.586
you're low-key perfect.

38:40.068 --> 38:41.896
You're the best girl that
I ever had in my life.

38:44.482 --> 38:47.758
And it's just easier to
keep you at a distance
than to just dive all in.

38:49.137 --> 38:50.965
And that's just me
keeping it real.

38:55.137 --> 38:56.655
I can appreciate the honesty.

39:00.068 --> 39:04.068
Thank you. Look, can
we just enjoy the rest
of this night and just

39:04.103 --> 39:06.724
leave this deep ass
conversation for tomorrow?

39:08.724 --> 39:09.724
I guess.

39:10.482 --> 39:11.000
Thank you.

39:12.724 --> 39:13.931
Why you always doing it?

39:15.068 --> 39:16.793
Come on, nurse,

39:16.827 --> 39:20.586
why you always doing that?
Oh, Zay, stop. Oh my gosh.

39:24.137 --> 39:28.931
Doing all that baby stuff.
Everybody got tired.

39:31.931 --> 39:33.586
Is that too damn?

39:33.620 --> 39:35.586
Zay, okay.
Where's Casey?

39:35.620 --> 39:36.586
Where's Casey?

39:36.620 --> 39:37.482
I don't know man.

39:37.517 --> 39:39.000
We gotta go. Sure.

39:39.034 --> 39:41.586
That was fucking crazy,
bro. She's been real bro.

39:41.620 --> 39:42.413
That's some bullshit.

39:53.620 --> 39:55.413

40:01.655 --> 40:02.931
Shit. Fucking crazy.

40:06.965 --> 40:08.620
Oh.

40:08.655 --> 40:11.206

40:11.241 --> 40:13.206
Oh, I gotta come play
with your ass. Oh my god.

40:13.241 --> 40:16.551
Come on. Darling,

40:16.586 --> 40:19.000
Don't you. I'm not the one.
Alright.

40:25.620 --> 40:30.034
My girls, where we going?

40:36.620 --> 40:39.034

Hello!

40:53.241 --> 40:54.103

40:54.137 --> 40:55.965

40:56.000 --> 40:58.551

41:02.827 --> 41:07.000

1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:39.793
So, what you bailing on me?

1:08:41.517 --> 1:08:42.827
I ain't helping you
kill any more people.

1:08:43.896 --> 1:08:45.689
I mean I can't stand Zay either

1:08:47.379 --> 1:08:48.172
but this isn't right.

1:08:56.896 --> 1:08:57.689
Not right.

1:09:02.344 --> 1:09:05.758
You really think I give a fuck
about what you think is right.

1:09:12.551 --> 1:09:14.551
I own you.

1:09:16.758 --> 1:09:21.000
And you're gonna kill
as many fucking people
that I tell you to kill.

1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:26.758
Mark,

1:09:28.413 --> 1:09:29.206
let's not forget

1:09:30.793 --> 1:09:33.206
you were the one that threw
the national championship game.

1:09:35.275 --> 1:09:37.896
You wouldn't want
millions of fans to know
that now, would you?

1:09:39.724 --> 1:09:41.896
I can't let you keep
holding that over my head.

1:09:43.724 --> 1:09:44.724
Mark,

1:09:45.586 --> 1:09:46.206
think!

1:09:48.586 --> 1:09:49.827
Think about what your
father was saying.

1:09:51.793 --> 1:09:53.931
My star quarterback son

1:09:55.931 --> 1:09:59.551
is a punk-ass bitch
cause he don't give a
fuck about his team.

1:10:05.965 --> 1:10:07.931
Oh, shit!

1:10:10.965 --> 1:10:13.413
You tell him, I'll kill you.

1:10:19.689 --> 1:10:20.620
Where's my shit?

1:10:24.551 --> 1:10:25.551
Over there.

1:10:48.068 --> 1:10:49.896
Not unless I kill you first.

1:11:25.448 --> 1:11:26.965
Oh, fuck!

1:11:28.206 --> 1:11:32.862
Casey laughed at me. Amy laughed
at me. Jordan laughed at me.

1:11:34.448 --> 1:11:35.965
Fuck you.

1:11:41.344 --> 1:11:43.344
Ah fuck!

1:11:58.482 --> 1:12:03.379
You can dream this is all
part of a fucking play, huh?

1:12:03.413 --> 1:12:05.103
Exactly.

1:12:05.137 --> 1:12:09.517
All I needed to do is get
your fucking ass here.

1:12:09.551 --> 1:12:12.655
I couldn't just kill you. I
had to make it look random.

1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:24.000
Come on.

1:12:58.551 --> 1:13:01.896
Help!
Go, get him! Go, get him!

1:13:01.931 --> 1:13:05.103
Why would he do that?

1:13:05.137 --> 1:13:06.758
Help!

1:13:12.620 --> 1:13:15.413
Help! We need help!

1:13:30.551 --> 1:13:33.896
Help! Help!

1:13:33.931 --> 1:13:35.103
Girl, look!

1:13:35.137 --> 1:13:37.689
We need help. We
need help please.

1:13:37.724 --> 1:13:39.931
This is the best haunted trial
I've ever been to in my life.

1:13:40.931 --> 1:13:44.068
We need help! Help!

1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:10.896
Help!

1:14:54.310 --> 1:14:55.103
Oh,

1:15:22.068 --> 1:15:24.793
so much fun.

1:15:25.793 --> 1:15:27.793
Wasn't that fun, Austin?

1:15:28.379 --> 1:15:29.758
That was fun.

1:15:30.827 --> 1:15:33.172
I fucking spared his life.

1:15:36.655 --> 1:15:38.241
I could have killed him.

1:15:39.344 --> 1:15:41.793
I could have fucking killed him.

1:15:41.827 --> 1:15:44.068
I could've fucking killed him.

1:15:44.103 --> 1:15:48.172
Fuck you. Fuck you, Zay.
Fuck you, Zay. Fuck you.

1:15:48.206 --> 1:15:49.551
Fuck you.

1:15:53.758 --> 1:15:57.551
Oh, I'm gonna fucking kill
this. It's okay, Austin.

1:15:58.758 --> 1:16:01.206
You'll get her next.
