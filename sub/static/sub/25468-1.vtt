01:35.125 --> 01:37.575
Don't go.

01:37.750 --> 01:40.130
I have to go. I promised him.

01:41.667 --> 01:44.077
Now promise me
you'll look after yourself.

01:44.208 --> 01:45.668
Yeah.

01:46.500 --> 01:48.540
I'm going hunting. I love you.

01:55.375 --> 01:57.455
I love you too.

02:11.750 --> 02:13.830
- Go.
- I don't wanna go.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.380
- Hurry up.
- Nice to see you too, mate.

02:21.500 --> 02:23.960
Amazing news, by the way.
Congratulations.

02:24.125 --> 02:27.915
Thanks, Marcus. It's pretty crazy, eh?

02:28.000 --> 02:30.080
Pretty crazy.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.210
- You okay?
- Mmm.

02:35.375 --> 02:37.375
- Will you be alright?
- Well, yeah.

02:37.500 --> 02:38.540
- Sure?
- Yep.

02:38.625 --> 02:39.625
Yeah.

02:49.708 --> 02:51.828
So I guess you finally had sex
with a woman.

02:51.917 --> 02:55.377
Yes, yes, and... and she was...
she was awake.

02:55.500 --> 02:58.250
- Yeah.
- That's a first.

02:58.333 --> 03:02.543
I know. I'm sorry. I know you always
wanted to be the one I got pregnant.

03:02.625 --> 03:07.245
Well, you might wanna double-check the
child doesn't come out looking like me.

03:07.333 --> 03:11.133
So how you been?
All this baby shit. It must be mad.

03:11.208 --> 03:15.418
Yeah, it is, man. It's insane.
It's fucking surreal.

03:15.500 --> 03:17.790
I'll actually forget
that she's pregnant.

03:17.917 --> 03:19.747
It freaks me out every time I remember.

03:19.833 --> 03:22.133
- It's insane.
- Oh, my God, man, I bet.

03:22.292 --> 03:25.042
- Yeah, yeah.
- Rather you than me, my friend.

03:25.167 --> 03:28.997
But, you know... I am pleased for you.

03:30.208 --> 03:32.918
Thanks, man. It's good to see you.

03:35.250 --> 03:37.040
You too, man. You too.

04:00.667 --> 04:03.707
- Bloody hell, man.
- Amazing, right?

04:03.833 --> 04:04.883
Yeah.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.210
The old man used to bring me here
hunting when I was a kid.

04:09.458 --> 04:11.538
Gunn's Wood.

04:12.250 --> 04:14.750
Reckon you can take down a deer?

04:14.833 --> 04:18.253
No. Probably not, no.

04:18.333 --> 04:20.463
Not everyone can do it.

04:21.541 --> 04:24.462
The trick is you have to switch off
your emotions, let instinct kick in.

04:24.583 --> 04:26.963
It's never seemed very fair to me, man,
shooting a deer.

04:27.125 --> 04:30.875
Well, life's not fair, Vaughn.
We learned that at school.

04:32.792 --> 04:35.752
Yeah, but we were 12, weren't we?

04:36.792 --> 04:39.332
This is it, Vaughny-boy,
the last few days of your freedom.

04:39.417 --> 04:43.127
- You have to enjoy it, man.
- I'm sorry. I know. It'll be fun.

05:23.500 --> 05:25.330
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm Freya.

05:25.417 --> 05:28.127
Marcus Trenton and Vaughn Carter?
Three nights?

05:28.208 --> 05:30.668
- That's right, yes.
- Yep.

05:30.750 --> 05:33.920
Addresses and phone numbers
in the book, please.

05:34.042 --> 05:35.082
Hey, wee man.

05:38.875 --> 05:41.195
It's quiet enough, isn't it?
Must all kick off around ten.

05:57.542 --> 06:02.252
So this is where they all hide.
Get a drink. I'm going for a slash.

06:09.625 --> 06:13.035
- How are you?
- Not bad. How you doing?

06:13.208 --> 06:16.828
I'm good. I, uh...
I hear that you're stalking.

06:16.917 --> 06:19.377
- Stalking?
- Aye, well, hunting.

06:19.500 --> 06:22.710
Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, we are, yeah.
It's not really my thing.

06:22.875 --> 06:27.625
It's my friend's gig, really.
He gave me a gun, got me a license.

06:27.708 --> 06:31.038
- Well, you know how to handle a gun?
- Yeah, yeah.

06:31.167 --> 06:34.747
I did a bit of shooting on a range
when I was at school, so yeah.

06:34.833 --> 06:37.883
Yeah, we haven't had so many folks
stalking this last season.

06:37.958 --> 06:41.328
There's a massive country club
opened 50 miles off.

06:41.458 --> 06:43.378
It drained a lot of our trade.

06:43.500 --> 06:46.460
I think my friend's made a point
of avoiding that place, so don't worry.

06:46.542 --> 06:49.902
Aye? Oh, good for him. I'm Logan, by the way.
- Vaughn. Nice to meet you. - And you.

06:51.708 --> 06:54.458
Oh, Marcus. This is Logan.

06:54.583 --> 06:56.793
Hey. Good to meet you.

06:56.917 --> 07:00.577
I hear that you lads might need
a ghillie out there with you tomorrow.

07:00.667 --> 07:02.077
Oh, no. We'll be stalking alone.

07:02.250 --> 07:05.170
It's all cleared with Lord Griffin.
My father knew him, so...

07:05.333 --> 07:08.883
Two pints of IPA, please,
two Laphroaigs and...

07:08.958 --> 07:12.038
- Can I get you a drink, Logan?
- Oh, no. I'm alright, thanks.

07:14.542 --> 07:18.752
You, uh... Well, you boys have
a good day's hunting out there, eh?

07:18.833 --> 07:20.543
We will.

07:26.167 --> 07:28.917
What? He'd have rattled on for hours.

07:30.667 --> 07:33.457
What did you say? What did you say?

07:33.542 --> 07:36.882
- Shut the fuck up.
- Straight to his face, man.

07:36.958 --> 07:39.708
Oh, the memory's still etched
in my mind.

07:39.792 --> 07:41.962
Nobody tried that
with the field marshal. Nobody.

07:42.083 --> 07:44.963
Fucking deserved it. The way
he used to talk to you, it wound me up.

07:45.042 --> 07:46.542
Loyal to the end, Vaughny-boy.

07:46.625 --> 07:49.705
In that case, borderline insane,
but, you know...

07:50.417 --> 07:52.037
God, he could be a mean old bastard.

07:52.208 --> 07:54.078
Yeah. Yeah, he could.

07:55.042 --> 07:56.172
You miss him?

07:57.292 --> 08:01.292
No, man, no. It's been...
It's been three years, you know.

08:02.958 --> 08:05.038
Yeah, fuck him.

08:06.750 --> 08:10.130
Oh, my God. Kara, you can't say that.

08:18.375 --> 08:20.455
Any chance of a drink?

08:21.958 --> 08:25.168
- Yeah, definitely.
- Two double whisky and cokes.

08:25.250 --> 08:27.380
I'm Kara. This is Iona.

08:28.833 --> 08:31.383
- Do you wanna get that?
- I'll get these, yes.

08:32.250 --> 08:34.750
Uh, Marcus, Vaughn.

08:35.707 --> 08:37.378
You alright, mate?

08:38.875 --> 08:41.558
- What the fuck you playing at?
- Jesus Christ. Take it fucking easy.

08:41.582 --> 08:44.383
Take your hands off my friend, big man.

08:44.458 --> 08:46.958
I'll knock you on your arse,
you fucking flash prick.

08:47.042 --> 08:50.332
- Will you, now?
- Alright, Donald, that's enough.

08:56.750 --> 08:59.130
Sit down, son.

09:00.417 --> 09:02.957
Enjoy your night.

09:04.417 --> 09:06.997
- I had that covered, man.
- Yeah, sure you did.

09:10.667 --> 09:11.877
- Sorry.
- It's alright.

09:11.958 --> 09:15.828
Two double whiskeys and cokes
and two IPAs, please.

09:15.917 --> 09:17.707
Keep an eye on your friend, huh?

09:22.125 --> 09:24.875
You guys picked
the perfect weekend to be here.

09:24.958 --> 09:27.498
- Oh, yeah? Why?
- Alban Eiler.

09:27.583 --> 09:30.003
Alban... Alban, what?

09:32.333 --> 09:34.883
- Alban Eiler.
- Oh, right, Alban Eiler.

09:36.125 --> 09:38.575
It's this big festival thing
on Sunday night.

09:38.667 --> 09:41.997
- The weekend gets boozy as hell.
- Oh, cool.

09:45.750 --> 09:51.290
Whoa. Do yourself a favor.
Steer clear of that wee lassie.

09:52.833 --> 09:54.333
What if I don't?

09:54.458 --> 09:59.378
Just offering some friendly advice,
pal. It's your funeral.

10:09.208 --> 10:10.458
Fucking...

10:12.500 --> 10:13.540

- Come on, then.

11:09.042 --> 11:11.172
Enjoy your night.

11:16.792 --> 11:20.172
- Marcus seems wild.
- Yeah, he is.

11:20.333 --> 11:22.543
- How long have you known him?
- Marcus?

11:24.125 --> 11:26.205
15 years.

11:29.708 --> 11:33.958
Met him at boarding school.
He kind of took me under his wing.

11:34.125 --> 11:36.705
I haven't really been able
to get rid of him since.

11:36.833 --> 11:39.833
- You went to boarding school?
- Yeah.

11:39.958 --> 11:41.958
- You did?
- Yeah.

11:43.375 --> 11:45.375
Why did you go there?

11:45.500 --> 11:49.250
Parents went to work abroad when
I was 12, so they chucked me in there.

11:49.417 --> 11:52.127
- Wow. That's pretty harsh.
- Yeah.

11:54.208 --> 11:56.078
Yeah, it is harsh.

11:56.167 --> 11:57.497
Fuckers.

12:09.333 --> 12:13.423
I've got a fiancée, and she's pregnant.

12:23.250 --> 12:24.830
Iona.

12:26.375 --> 12:28.915
- I'm sorry. Listen, I should have...
- Listen, no.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.960
- I should have said. I should...
- Listen.

12:31.083 --> 12:33.753
I have had a fucking boring week.

12:37.292 --> 12:41.542
My mum owns the inn.
And I have the bar keys.

12:43.125 --> 12:45.245
Just come and have a drink with me.

12:46.958 --> 12:49.038
- Yeah?
- Of course.

12:50.792 --> 12:52.502
Okay.

12:58.125 --> 13:00.915
- So you grew up here?
- Yep.

13:04.542 --> 13:08.712
I should probably think about leaving
soon, though, before it's too late.

13:08.833 --> 13:11.253
I don't know.
I think it's quite cool. I like it.

13:11.333 --> 13:14.543
- Try living here.
- This is true.

13:16.458 --> 13:18.748
So, how are you feeling
about being a dad?

13:18.875 --> 13:20.955
I don't know.

13:22.833 --> 13:25.583
I mean, it's fucking terrifying. It's...

13:25.708 --> 13:27.958
Yeah, course it is.

13:30.208 --> 13:32.578
No, I think you'll be okay.

13:32.708 --> 13:34.378
I hope so.

13:35.417 --> 13:37.167
Cheers.

13:48.542 --> 13:50.132
Rise and shine.

13:50.250 --> 13:52.630
Come on, Vaughn. Get up!

13:52.750 --> 13:54.500
We're late.

13:54.583 --> 13:58.173
Morning. Come on, Vaughn.
Hop to it. We're late.

13:59.917 --> 14:01.997
Get up.

14:21.375 --> 14:24.535
Someone crept back
suspiciously late last night.

14:24.625 --> 14:27.955
Nothing fucking happened, man, okay?
So just shut up.

14:28.042 --> 14:31.422
Just... I'm just hungover.

14:31.500 --> 14:33.580
I mean, how come you're so fresh?

14:34.583 --> 14:36.963
Oh, you're not sniffing
that shit again, are you?

14:37.083 --> 14:40.173
I didn't smoke. I told you, smoking
gives you hangovers, not alcohol.

14:40.250 --> 14:42.000
Jesus, man,
I thought you quit that stuff.

14:42.125 --> 14:43.825
I'm on my holidays.

15:18.333 --> 15:20.833
Jesus Christ, mate. You look like shit.

15:21.708 --> 15:23.788
Can you just do me a favor
and just shoot me?

15:23.917 --> 15:26.667
Here. Take a shot of this.

15:31.500 --> 15:33.830
- Oh, fuck. I've forgotten the ammo.
- You're joking me.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.920
We're gonna have to go back
to the hotel, mate.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.380
- Can I not just use yours?
- No, you can't just use mine.

15:38.458 --> 15:40.998
You can't put .270 ammo
into a .243 rifle.

15:41.083 --> 15:44.833
- You'll blow your own head off.
- Okay, I don't care. I'll just...

15:44.917 --> 15:48.037
Use my .22.
And please don't fucking drop that.

17:19.166 --> 17:21.287
You take it, man. I'm not.

17:24.500 --> 17:26.540
It's your spot, your kill.

17:33.125 --> 17:35.535
Now, remember what I said.

17:35.625 --> 17:38.375
Just relax and let it happen.

17:45.208 --> 17:47.918
Do it now, Vaughn. Take the shot.

17:56.500 --> 17:58.580
Do it. Now, Vaughn.

18:18.250 --> 18:20.750
Vaughn. Vaughn, come back. Vaughn, no.

18:23.083 --> 18:24.753
Vaughn.

18:26.708 --> 18:28.288
Vaughn.

18:41.667 --> 18:43.377
Sammy!

18:44.958 --> 18:46.498
Sammy!

18:56.500 --> 18:59.040
Here. Here.

18:59.917 --> 19:02.377
Come on. Come on.

19:13.458 --> 19:15.538
Okay, okay.

19:20.875 --> 19:22.995
You fucking...

19:26.708 --> 19:27.998
Shit.

19:34.792 --> 19:36.502
Sorry.

19:37.792 --> 19:39.462
Sammy.

19:40.708 --> 19:42.788
Sammy. Sammy!

19:43.750 --> 19:45.830
Oh, my boy!

19:47.083 --> 19:48.713
Sammy.

19:49.458 --> 19:51.168
Sammy.

19:52.875 --> 19:54.955
Oh, my boy.

19:57.875 --> 20:01.165
Oh, my boy. Oh, Sammy. I didn't see him.
I didn't see him. I didn't see him.

20:27.833 --> 20:29.043
I didn't...

20:31.375 --> 20:34.785
I didn't see him. I didn't see him.

21:14.833 --> 21:16.923
Oh, my God.

22:10.542 --> 22:14.582
Okay, here we go. Here we go. Come here.

22:14.708 --> 22:17.168
There we go. There we go.

22:17.250 --> 22:21.420
Come on. There we go. There we go.
There we go. There we go.

22:27.708 --> 22:29.748
Run. Run.

22:29.875 --> 22:31.535
Run.

23:42.542 --> 23:45.582
Marcus. Marcus.
What are you doing? Marcus.

23:48.125 --> 23:51.415
Marcus. Marcus. Marcus.
What are you doing?

23:51.542 --> 23:54.172
We have to be seen hunting
somewhere else.

23:54.250 --> 23:57.250
- What? We're just gonna report it.
- You shot a child.

23:59.208 --> 24:00.748
It was... It was an accident.

24:00.833 --> 24:02.583
- With my gun.
- It was a fucking accident.

24:02.667 --> 24:04.327
It's illegal for you to even use my gun.

24:04.458 --> 24:06.208
I don't care.
We just go to the police...

24:06.333 --> 24:07.923
- Go to the police?
- We explain.

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
Stinking of whisky?
It'll be considered murder.

24:13.875 --> 24:17.165
Can you handle prison, mate?
Because I don't think I can.

24:17.292 --> 24:19.292
Jesus, fuck, man.
Jesus fucking Christ.

24:19.458 --> 24:22.668
- Fucking Anna, man. Fuck.
- Exactly, Vaughn. Exactly.

24:22.792 --> 24:24.882
You could be in for years.

24:26.667 --> 24:30.457
And I shot that man from over
a hundred yards away. I'm fucked too.

24:31.542 --> 24:34.752
Because I was protecting you, Vaughn.
Protecting you.

24:45.958 --> 24:49.038
They were in a tent.
They were probably tourists.

24:49.125 --> 24:51.745
And we are in the middle
of fucking nowhere.

24:51.833 --> 24:53.833
In hundreds of miles of forest.

24:56.042 --> 24:59.462
If we bury the bodies, it could be days,
weeks, months until they're found.

24:59.542 --> 25:02.922
I'm not fucking burying people.
Listen to what you're saying.

25:03.042 --> 25:06.832
We go back to that town and we come
back here tonight and we bury them.

25:07.583 --> 25:10.003
No, man.
Look, listen to yourself, Marcus.

25:10.083 --> 25:13.833
- We're not burying people.
- The alternatives are unthinkable.

25:16.417 --> 25:17.917
- Vaughn...
- Just shut up. Shut up.

25:18.083 --> 25:20.883
- You have to trust me.
- I... Shut up.

25:25.792 --> 25:27.882
I'm getting us out of this, mate.

25:29.333 --> 25:32.883
I'm doing this for both our sakes.
You just have to trust me.

25:35.125 --> 25:37.205
I can't do this, man.

25:38.375 --> 25:41.125
You have no choice.
You have no choice, Vaughn.

26:31.458 --> 26:34.328
We need to be seen up here.
Further north.

26:36.542 --> 26:38.582
There has to be something.

27:06.458 --> 27:08.078
Hi.

27:09.375 --> 27:12.665
Oh, it's a cold one. How are you?

27:12.750 --> 27:16.750
Culcarran's south.
What are you doing up here?

27:16.875 --> 27:19.245
We've been hunting Drumrain
all afternoon.

27:19.333 --> 27:24.003
Aye, Logan told me about you.
There's no other stalkers out.

27:29.333 --> 27:31.423
Be still.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.670
- How much for the fuel?
- Call it 20.

27:44.708 --> 27:47.128
Thank you. Have a nice day.

27:51.667 --> 27:53.377
Aye.

28:10.333 --> 28:12.003
You okay?

28:17.292 --> 28:19.712
Nothing happened out there, okay?

28:32.250 --> 28:35.750
Yeah, we could... Okay.
We could do that next... next week.

28:35.833 --> 28:38.133
Oh, okay. Got to go.

28:38.250 --> 28:40.630
- How did you get on?
- Oh, a total washout.

28:40.708 --> 28:46.458
Oh. Well, no chefs tonight.
But there's bar food at the Stag's.

28:46.542 --> 28:49.172
Or there's the restaurant there.
It's pricey, mind.

28:49.333 --> 28:52.173
- Thanks.
- Alright. Thank you so much.

28:52.292 --> 28:54.542
- Thank you.
- Night.

29:07.333 --> 29:09.383
We need to eat.

29:10.875 --> 29:14.245
And we need to get out there.
It won't look right if we don't.

29:34.750 --> 29:38.630
Hey. Fancy some more drinks tonight?

29:38.708 --> 29:41.078
- Not tonight.
- Maybe later?

29:41.208 --> 29:43.078
Tomorrow.
Let's go, Vaughn. I'm starving.

29:43.208 --> 29:46.538
- You okay?
- Yeah, just a bit hungover.

29:58.583 --> 30:02.133
- Uh, where is the restaurant?
- Just round to the left.

30:02.292 --> 30:04.382
Thank you.

30:14.667 --> 30:16.077
Evening.

30:16.167 --> 30:18.577
Join us if you like.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.080
Yeah, sure. Why not?

30:24.042 --> 30:26.672
This is... This is Al.
He's a cousin of mine.

30:26.792 --> 30:29.292
- Al, this is Marcus and Vaughn.
- Pleased to meet you.

30:29.375 --> 30:31.285
- Nice to meet you.
- Have a seat.

30:31.375 --> 30:32.995
Please.

30:35.708 --> 30:38.538
Successful day's stalking?

30:38.625 --> 30:40.535
Uh, no. A total washout.

30:40.625 --> 30:43.625
Oh. Well, let's see
if we can't improve things.

30:43.750 --> 30:46.500
I, uh, well, I...
I recommend the venison.

30:46.583 --> 30:48.293
Huh?

30:49.292 --> 30:52.002
- Yeah.
- Good. Peter, two more venison.

30:52.833 --> 30:55.673
- Some wine?
- Please.

31:00.375 --> 31:01.995
You look a bit rough. Are you alright?

31:02.125 --> 31:04.995
Yeah, yeah. Just had far too much
last night. Stupid.

31:05.083 --> 31:06.463
Don't feel great.

31:06.542 --> 31:09.042
That's really no state
to have gone hunting in.

31:09.958 --> 31:12.958
- Isn't that right, Alastair?
- Shocking behavior.

31:13.042 --> 31:15.882
Aye,
you wouldnae catch us doing that.

31:20.292 --> 31:23.212
- As long as you had a good time.
- Yeah.

31:24.083 --> 31:26.293
So where did you lads stalk?

31:27.917 --> 31:31.207
Drumrain. It's beautiful up there,
really beautiful.

31:31.292 --> 31:36.672
The woods are right enough.
But not the village. Not any more.

31:37.542 --> 31:39.422
Yeah, what's happening with that place?

31:39.500 --> 31:43.750
It's turning into a ghost town.
It's just dying, slowly, over time.

31:43.833 --> 31:47.793
These kind of villages, they, well,
they survive on a knife's edge.

31:48.458 --> 31:51.288
I can imagine it's quite rough
up here this time of year.

31:51.458 --> 31:54.958
Aye. And brutal not so long ago.

31:55.042 --> 31:57.922
There's always a risk
of things sliding back that way.

31:58.000 --> 32:01.000
Aye, it pretty well comes down
on the individual folk

32:01.083 --> 32:02.503
to maintain the order of things.

32:02.958 --> 32:06.878
Logan and his father before him,
they held this place together.

32:07.583 --> 32:08.963
Aye. We all have.

32:16.250 --> 32:18.080
Are you... Are you not enjoying that?

32:18.167 --> 32:20.417
No, no. It's lovely, lovely.

32:24.042 --> 32:28.132
So, Iona tells me
that you're about to become a father.

32:29.458 --> 32:31.748
- Yeah, I am. Yeah, yeah.
- Congratulations.

32:31.833 --> 32:34.003
Yeah, thank you.

32:34.125 --> 32:35.705
Is that a boy or a girl you're having?

32:35.875 --> 32:38.535
Excuse me for just a second.
Be right back.

32:40.625 --> 32:43.575
Early to bed tonight, aye?

32:59.875 --> 33:01.915
Folk are resilient up here.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.670
They'll take three, four jobs
to survive.

33:04.750 --> 33:06.790
If the work's there.

33:06.875 --> 33:09.035
So what is it you do yourself?
Finance and investment.

33:11.042 --> 33:12.882
Hmm.

33:17.000 --> 33:20.920
Aye, we've... we've rested
on past glories here, fallen behind.

33:21.042 --> 33:22.712
But we'll make it through this stretch.

33:22.833 --> 33:25.833
And there's real, well, there's
real potential for development here.

33:25.917 --> 33:27.957
Absolutely. Anyone can see that.

33:28.042 --> 33:30.752
Listen, I don't wanna
put you on the spot

33:30.833 --> 33:34.133
or sully a good dinner with business,
but could I give you my card?

33:34.208 --> 33:37.788
Yeah, sure. I know
some good people you could talk to.

33:37.875 --> 33:40.455
Thank you. Good man.

33:41.833 --> 33:43.543
Cheers.

34:36.458 --> 34:39.038
Is he... Is he okay in there?

34:39.167 --> 34:43.377
I should check on him. It's my fault
he's had too many drinks last night.

34:45.208 --> 34:48.208
- Aye.
- Are you alright?

34:48.292 --> 34:50.542
- Yeah, yeah.
- Alright?

34:50.625 --> 34:53.625
I think I'm gonna waive the food
for just now.

34:53.750 --> 34:57.170
- Stomach's not quite up to it yet.
- Aye, we've all been there.

34:57.250 --> 35:00.460
Aye, some of us more times than others.

35:02.167 --> 35:05.827
We'd offer another, but it's, well,
it's obviously not the night, huh?

35:05.917 --> 35:07.127
No.

35:07.250 --> 35:09.630
We should...
We should shoot in any case.

35:09.750 --> 35:12.170
Still lots to prepare
for Alban Eiler tomorrow.

35:12.250 --> 35:14.830
- And what's that?
- It's a solstice festival.

35:14.958 --> 35:16.828
It marks the last week
of the hunting season.

35:16.958 --> 35:20.168
Well, it's just a... a piss-up
and a bonfire these days, really.

35:20.292 --> 35:22.542
But brings everyone together.

35:24.417 --> 35:27.707
The, uh, bill's covered. I insist.

35:29.042 --> 35:31.502
- That's very generous. Thank you.
- Pleasure to meet you.

35:31.583 --> 35:32.963
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

35:33.042 --> 35:34.922
You're welcome. Take care.
Get some rest.

35:35.042 --> 35:36.292
- I will.
- I've got your card.

35:36.375 --> 35:37.559
- Pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

35:37.583 --> 35:40.633
Have a good night. Take care.

36:42.375 --> 36:43.745
This isn't going to be easy.

36:51.667 --> 36:53.247
It's four hours till daylight.

36:55.458 --> 36:56.578
We need to dig a hole.

37:00.750 --> 37:02.460
Six foot deep.

37:03.708 --> 37:05.418
Here.

37:10.417 --> 37:12.877
- Vaughn.
- Yeah.

37:33.500 --> 37:37.670
- Fucking hell, man.
- If we're seen here, we're fucked.

37:38.458 --> 37:40.958
You've been a complete liability
since this has happened.

37:41.042 --> 37:44.502
Vaughn, take the torch
and help me dig this fucking thing.

40:08.583 --> 40:10.673
Okay, that's enough.

40:11.833 --> 40:13.713
- You said six feet.
- I know. It'll have to do.

40:13.833 --> 40:16.883
We've no time.
Daylight's coming. Come on.

40:26.417 --> 40:28.037
Okay.

40:28.792 --> 40:30.922
Under the arms. Ready?

41:07.125 --> 41:08.745
Oh, God.

41:18.792 --> 41:20.382
What the fuck you doing?

41:28.542 --> 41:30.582
The other bullet's in his skull.

41:32.625 --> 41:35.375
It's traceable back to me.
It's as good as a fingerprint, Vaughn.

41:35.500 --> 41:37.670
I don't fucking care.
Put the fucking knife away.

41:37.750 --> 41:39.250
Vaughn, think.

41:39.333 --> 41:41.633
If they find the bodies,

41:41.708 --> 41:44.958
they'll find the bullet
and they'll come looking for me.

41:47.375 --> 41:51.495
It's a child, Marcus.
It's a little boy.

41:51.583 --> 41:54.003
- Do you think I want to do this?
- No, I don't think you do.

41:54.083 --> 41:57.463
- So put the fucking knife away.
- I have no choice, Vaughn.

41:58.500 --> 42:00.040
I have no choice.

42:05.125 --> 42:07.205
Vaughn. Vaughn.

42:08.292 --> 42:09.832
Vaughn.

42:09.917 --> 42:13.627
Fucking leave! Move. Stay down.

42:13.708 --> 42:15.248
Stay down, mate, please.

43:50.000 --> 43:51.880
The sun will be up in an hour.

43:54.250 --> 43:56.380
We go back, stay for a couple of hours.

43:58.792 --> 44:00.882
Wait until the village wakes up.

44:04.792 --> 44:06.832
Then make our excuses and leave.

44:48.417 --> 44:50.327
What?

44:51.792 --> 44:53.882
Jesus. Come on.

45:11.042 --> 45:14.792
Try to rest.
I'll wake you in a couple of hours.

47:44.917 --> 47:46.997
Christ. I must have passed out.

47:51.333 --> 47:52.833
It's midday, Marcus.

47:55.167 --> 47:59.577
No harm done. We just pack our bags
and we get out of here.

48:03.708 --> 48:05.788
Come on, man.

48:41.875 --> 48:44.245
This is it.
Give me that fucking knife.

48:53.083 --> 48:56.133
Something's happening.
There's people at the jeep.

48:58.042 --> 49:00.672
Hey. What's going on?

49:03.000 --> 49:04.790
Whoa. Hey.

49:04.875 --> 49:07.325
Tell me what you did.
Tell me what you did.

49:07.417 --> 49:09.457
What the hell's going on?

49:09.542 --> 49:13.582
- Fucking fucker!
- Away from him, for Christ's sake!

49:13.708 --> 49:16.628
- What are you doing?
- Fucking bastard.

49:16.708 --> 49:20.708
Tell him what you did. Tell him
what you did. You know what he did?

49:22.667 --> 49:24.707
He fucked Kara.

49:26.208 --> 49:29.998
Gave her cocaine.
Filled her with the stuff.

49:35.917 --> 49:39.037
Hey, let him go. Let him go.

49:40.083 --> 49:41.633
Let him go.

49:43.042 --> 49:45.792
Get away, alright? I'll deal with this.
I'll deal with this.

49:45.958 --> 49:48.038
I'll deal with this, alright?

49:49.833 --> 49:51.833
You're a boss, little brother.

49:51.958 --> 49:55.748
I don't wanna hear another word
about cocaine. Do you understand?

49:58.375 --> 50:02.125
Frank will take care of this.
Get the jeep over to the garage.

50:02.292 --> 50:05.082
Bring a truck over, Granty,
and the A-frame.

50:05.208 --> 50:06.748
Take the sex pest with you.

50:06.833 --> 50:09.633
So, will we look at the damage?

50:11.875 --> 50:13.575
Cannae say I didnae warn you.

50:17.375 --> 50:18.665
That's bad.

50:21.250 --> 50:24.040
And that one's slashed too.
They're both fucked.

50:36.792 --> 50:40.042
What the fuck are we gonna do?
That stuff's in the boot.

50:40.167 --> 50:42.537
We need to get it out.

50:42.667 --> 50:44.747
There's blood on the shirt.

50:46.333 --> 50:48.423
We need to get a car.

50:49.625 --> 50:53.915
And we need to get rid of it, and
we can't get rid of it near the village.

51:00.250 --> 51:04.170
That second tyre, mate,
isn't gonna be cheap.

51:04.250 --> 51:08.040
Can I get the keys? Just meant
to grab our stuff out the boot.

51:10.875 --> 51:14.535
Where's the sex pest? Lazy fuck.

51:14.625 --> 51:17.035
Granty, check that spare for me.

51:29.542 --> 51:31.632
Here you go. Can we get it today, like?

52:21.083 --> 52:22.753
Hmm.

52:24.417 --> 52:25.917
It'll cost you extra.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.710
550, including labour.

52:33.375 --> 52:34.995
Okay.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.080
Okay, send it up.

52:38.167 --> 52:41.287
- Do you have a car we could use?
- Nope.

52:41.375 --> 52:43.875
We just wanted to get
some last-minute stalking in.

52:43.958 --> 52:46.208
Well, you probably blew
your chances of that

52:46.292 --> 52:50.292
when you fed somebody's daughter full of coke.
There'll not be a queue of people lining up round here

52:51.083 --> 52:52.753
to do you any favors, pal.

52:52.875 --> 52:55.625
- Where the fuck have you been?
- Give it a fucking rest, will you?

52:55.708 --> 52:58.378
- Do you need me this afternoon?
- No.

52:58.458 --> 53:01.878
I'll make do with that useless bastard.
Get your fucking rags on.

53:01.958 --> 53:04.998
Pete might take you out in his taxi.
I think he's in the Stag's.

53:05.083 --> 53:06.713
I'll get you over there, point him out.

53:06.833 --> 53:10.133
- Sounds good.
- Jeep'll be ready tomorrow.

53:13.417 --> 53:15.207
For 550, you can finish it today.

53:15.292 --> 53:18.922
For 550,
I'll finish it when I fucking like.

53:47.292 --> 53:49.382
No fucking way, Al.

53:51.417 --> 53:54.127
He doesn't look good.

53:54.250 --> 53:56.790
Pete, these guys are wanting a taxi.

53:56.958 --> 53:59.208
Then I'm your man.

53:59.292 --> 54:01.212
Let's go.

54:01.333 --> 54:03.793
Sit down, you silly sod.
You're steaming.

54:03.917 --> 54:06.537
- No, it's fine. Sorry, sorry.
- Sit down, man. Sit down.

54:06.708 --> 54:08.288
Thank you, though.

54:08.417 --> 54:10.667
Follow me, lads. Come on.
Take a seat over there.

54:10.833 --> 54:13.383
Go on. I just want a chat with you.
Sit down.

54:14.917 --> 54:18.457
There you go, boys. On the house.

54:25.167 --> 54:29.327
Now, these pints are for you
by way of an apology.

54:30.542 --> 54:33.132
An apology for messing up your car
and your stupid face.

54:33.208 --> 54:34.878
Brian.

54:36.458 --> 54:40.578
Even though you fucked my best mate's
daughter and gave her cocaine.

54:43.167 --> 54:44.247
Sounds fair.

54:46.458 --> 54:50.288
Sounds fair that I should apologize
to these arseholes

54:51.250 --> 54:53.330
'cause Logan says one is due.

54:54.458 --> 54:59.828
'Cause this twat here
is gonna bring investment in.

54:59.917 --> 55:02.497
- That's enough, Brian.
- No, it's not enough.

55:02.583 --> 55:05.253
Investments. Grants.

55:06.458 --> 55:08.708
Shite, the lot of it.

55:10.125 --> 55:12.825
And fucking embarrassing.

55:12.917 --> 55:16.957
Begging to city twats like this

55:17.042 --> 55:19.132
when we all know what should be done!

55:19.208 --> 55:21.628
Facing up to how fucked we are

55:21.708 --> 55:24.378
and doing whatever's necessary
to look out for ourselves.

55:24.458 --> 55:27.248
Whatever's necessary.

55:28.375 --> 55:29.875
Like folk used to.

55:31.542 --> 55:33.292
'Cause nae other bastards will.

55:41.417 --> 55:45.787
But Logan calls the shots
and apparently you do too, so...

55:48.000 --> 55:49.540
I'll apologize.

55:53.917 --> 55:55.037
I'm sorry, my friend.

56:01.750 --> 56:04.920
And I'm sorry to you too, pal.

56:05.083 --> 56:07.173
- I'm sorry.
- Am I fuck!

56:07.250 --> 56:08.710
Fucking...

56:08.792 --> 56:11.582
Take your fucking hands off me.

56:13.375 --> 56:14.785
I'm going anyway.

56:17.833 --> 56:21.333
- Fuck.
- Better get yourself cleaned up.

56:21.417 --> 56:23.077
Fuck.

56:25.292 --> 56:26.632
I'm sorry about this.

56:27.542 --> 56:30.422
- No, it's fine.
- Just finish your pint, huh?

56:31.208 --> 56:33.248
Yeah.

56:39.083 --> 56:40.753
Some day.

56:44.542 --> 56:48.382
It's Kara, you know.
She stirs everything up.

56:48.458 --> 56:50.708
Hmm.

56:50.792 --> 56:53.252
You know Brian's not alone
in his way of thinking.

56:53.333 --> 56:56.423
Well, they're wrong.
Let's not go down that road.

56:56.542 --> 57:00.672
I'm just saying. People are wound tight.
Logan needs to stay canny.

57:05.167 --> 57:09.377
- Where is he, anyway?
- He's out. Looking for Sammy.

57:10.042 --> 57:11.632
What's the story with that?

57:11.750 --> 57:16.130
Oh, they went camping supposedly.
Due in last night.

57:16.208 --> 57:19.628
Mary's not heard from them.
She's a bit concerned.

57:22.250 --> 57:24.170
Logan's nephew and brother-in-law.

57:25.875 --> 57:27.285
Oh, right.

57:27.417 --> 57:30.917
Logan'll find him. You know
how he dotes on that little 'un.

57:33.500 --> 57:35.380
It'll likely be nothing.

57:40.875 --> 57:43.955
- Are youse okay?
- Logan's nephew's missing.

57:44.042 --> 57:46.542
Camping in the woods.

57:46.625 --> 57:48.955
Oh, right.

57:49.042 --> 57:52.042
- And when were they due back?
- They?

57:56.667 --> 57:58.497
Well, he didn't go alone, did he?

57:58.583 --> 58:00.753
Why not?

58:00.833 --> 58:04.463
- An 11-year-old on his own?
- He doesn't know what age he is.

58:05.750 --> 58:09.460
Well, no, I just remembered
Logan mentioning something, didn't he?

58:09.542 --> 58:11.042
Yeah.

58:13.417 --> 58:15.497
Sorry. I just assumed.

58:21.125 --> 58:23.535
- So when's the bonfire?
- It's at seven.

58:23.625 --> 58:26.495
- Right.
- Yeah, we should make a move.

58:26.583 --> 58:30.213
- Yeah.
- Let's make a move, then.

58:30.292 --> 58:31.752
- Leaving already?
- Probably best.

58:31.833 --> 58:34.423
You needn't worry about Brian.
He won't try anything again.

58:34.542 --> 58:36.832
No, we've had a rough day, and I...

58:36.917 --> 58:39.577
But thank you so much.
And it's my round, so here.

58:39.667 --> 58:41.747
- Oh.
- Get a drink on me.

58:41.875 --> 58:43.705
Thank you so much, though.
Have a great day.

58:43.833 --> 58:45.543
Sorry.

58:48.417 --> 58:50.917
Thanks very much for the drinks.
Thank you.

59:07.583 --> 59:09.293
- Get rid of it.
- Where?

59:09.417 --> 59:11.127
I don't care, man. Just get rid of it.

59:11.208 --> 59:14.538
Marcus, it's their fucking relatives.
Just get rid of it.

01:00:35.375 --> 01:00:38.325
They could start searching those woods
any minute.

01:00:42.292 --> 01:00:44.382
There's miles of forest.

01:00:45.292 --> 01:00:47.292
We just have to keep our nerve.

01:00:54.042 --> 01:00:56.132
What about the boy?

01:00:56.958 --> 01:00:59.038
Just hope he stays quiet.

01:01:02.917 --> 01:01:05.037
It's getting to me.

01:01:12.333 --> 01:01:13.963
Vaughn...

01:01:15.542 --> 01:01:17.582
Everything I did here...

01:01:20.333 --> 01:01:22.083
I did it to protect us.

01:01:24.292 --> 01:01:26.792
Every decision I made,
I made it from my gut.

01:01:30.083 --> 01:01:32.793
And if we were in those woods,
you'd make the same decisions for me.

01:01:32.917 --> 01:01:34.787
Am I right?

01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:39.540
We were wrong. We were wrong.

01:01:43.917 --> 01:01:46.577
And we're gonna pay for it
because we should have just told them.

01:01:46.708 --> 01:01:51.128
Then go and tell them. Go and tell them.
They will rip you to pieces, Vaughn.

01:01:55.958 --> 01:01:58.788
Everything I did here
I did to protect you.

01:01:59.958 --> 01:02:02.378
And you're telling me I was wrong.

01:02:07.125 --> 01:02:09.075
You know you are, Marcus.

01:02:13.833 --> 01:02:15.963
Otherwise you wouldn't ask.

01:03:05.542 --> 01:03:08.172
Alright? What you doing up here?

01:03:09.250 --> 01:03:10.960
Just... Just having a drink.

01:03:11.042 --> 01:03:13.212
Well, get yourselves down there
for Christ's sakes.

01:03:13.292 --> 01:03:16.502
It's Alban Eiler.
People are expecting you.

01:03:16.583 --> 01:03:19.423
I think it's probably best
if we just stay in here tonight.

01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:21.790
It's festival night.
Get yourself down there.

01:03:24.042 --> 01:03:26.292
Yeah, of course, yeah.
We'll be there in two secs.

01:03:26.458 --> 01:03:29.998
Okay. See you down there.

01:03:30.083 --> 01:03:32.173
See you.

01:04:00.417 --> 01:04:02.537
- Help yourself, man.
- Thank you.

01:04:02.667 --> 01:04:04.917
Food's over there.

01:04:05.042 --> 01:04:06.712
Thanks.

01:04:43.708 --> 01:04:45.328
Have you told your mummy that?

01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:47.540
Bloody disappeared.

01:04:54.750 --> 01:04:58.580
Something's not right here,
man. Something's not right.

01:05:08.792 --> 01:05:12.922
Guys. Logan wants to speak to youse.

01:05:24.167 --> 01:05:26.537
My sister's husband and son
haven't come in.

01:05:26.625 --> 01:05:28.495
We know. Sorry to hear that.

01:05:28.583 --> 01:05:30.333
But we've found the car further north.

01:05:30.417 --> 01:05:33.377
We've asked around
and we've a decent idea where they were.

01:05:33.458 --> 01:05:37.458
We're putting together a search party.
Will you... Will you come out?

01:05:40.958 --> 01:05:43.538
Look, we need help out there.

01:05:44.875 --> 01:05:46.245
- Yeah, okay.
- Yeah, of course.

01:05:47.250 --> 01:05:50.710
Let's go.
The jeep's fixed. It's over there.

01:05:57.625 --> 01:05:59.705
Follow us out, yeah?

01:06:11.042 --> 01:06:13.422
Why did they give us the jeep?

01:06:13.542 --> 01:06:16.132
Because they want as many people
out here as possible, Marcus.

01:06:16.292 --> 01:06:17.962
They think they're still fucking alive.

01:06:18.083 --> 01:06:19.713
No, man. I think they're onto us.

01:06:19.875 --> 01:06:21.825
I think they're trying
to force our hand.

01:06:21.917 --> 01:06:23.577
Jesus.

01:06:25.125 --> 01:06:29.205
If we make a run for it now,
then they'll know for sure.

01:06:40.625 --> 01:06:43.125
Jesus, Marcus, we're going right there.
We're going to it.

01:06:43.292 --> 01:06:45.752
This road's miles long.
These woods are massive.

01:06:45.833 --> 01:06:47.273
What if they find the fucking grave?

01:06:47.333 --> 01:06:51.253
If they find the fucking grave, you will
make a run for it, mate, believe me.

01:06:57.375 --> 01:07:00.575
That was it. That was the place.
We've gone past it.

01:07:01.542 --> 01:07:03.832
They're going the wrong way. We're okay.

01:07:38.333 --> 01:07:40.293
What were you doing last night?

01:07:40.458 --> 01:07:43.668
- What do you mean?
- Well, what do you think I mean?

01:07:46.375 --> 01:07:50.995
Look, we went night hunting. I know it's
illegal, but it was my idea, not his.

01:07:51.083 --> 01:07:53.503
Well, that will be reported
to the police.

01:07:54.083 --> 01:07:55.793
Where did you night hunt?

01:07:57.667 --> 01:07:59.327
Uh, Gunn's Wood.

01:08:03.833 --> 01:08:05.673
Know how to work that, right? Yeah?

01:08:05.792 --> 01:08:07.882
Yeah, cheers. Thank you.

01:08:14.250 --> 01:08:16.040
Just keep an eye on both of them, eh?

01:08:32.917 --> 01:08:35.537
Come on, come on.
Shh, shh. Here, here, here.

01:08:37.417 --> 01:08:43.577
Three groups. Grant, Angus,
you two, take the right-hand path.

01:08:43.667 --> 01:08:46.077
- Al, Frank...
- Iona, you're with me.

01:08:46.167 --> 01:08:49.997
Over here, come on. Let's go. Here.

01:08:57.542 --> 01:08:59.252
Sammy! Sammy!

01:09:04.750 --> 01:09:06.670
Sammy!

01:09:07.750 --> 01:09:09.460
Sammy!

01:09:09.917 --> 01:09:11.827
Sammy!

01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:15.130
Calum!

01:09:16.917 --> 01:09:19.207
- Here, here.
- Calum!

01:09:19.792 --> 01:09:21.502
Hey! Sammy!

01:09:21.582 --> 01:09:23.252
Sammy!

01:09:25.875 --> 01:09:27.375
Sammy!

01:09:33.125 --> 01:09:34.785
Sammy!

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.830
Sammy!

01:09:37.917 --> 01:09:39.577
Sammy!

01:09:41.792 --> 01:09:43.502
Sammy!

01:09:46.082 --> 01:09:47.712
Calum!

01:09:48.207 --> 01:09:50.877
Angus. Angus. Anything at all?

01:09:50.957 --> 01:09:53.287
Here. Nothing.

01:09:53.957 --> 01:09:56.208
- Calum!
- Sammy!

01:09:56.333 --> 01:09:57.963
Sammy!

01:10:00.833 --> 01:10:04.423
We're really up against it.
It's just too large an area.

01:10:04.542 --> 01:10:05.672
Come on.

01:10:06.292 --> 01:10:08.002
Sammy!

01:10:10.625 --> 01:10:12.285
Sammy!

01:10:15.792 --> 01:10:17.462
Sammy!

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.790
Calum!

01:10:22.542 --> 01:10:24.132
Sammy!

01:10:26.250 --> 01:10:28.080
Sammy!

01:10:29.375 --> 01:10:32.125
Calum! Sammy!

01:10:36.417 --> 01:10:39.077
Dog's picked up a scent!

01:10:41.375 --> 01:10:43.535
We've picked up a scent. Southeast.

01:10:44.583 --> 01:10:46.253
Sammy!

01:10:46.375 --> 01:10:48.075
- Calum!
- Sammy!

01:10:50.167 --> 01:10:51.827
Sammy!

01:10:54.125 --> 01:10:57.205
Seek. Seek. Come on.

01:10:57.375 --> 01:10:59.455
Here. Seek.

01:11:01.292 --> 01:11:03.712
- Here you are!
- Huh? Here.

01:11:06.958 --> 01:11:09.578
- Is there anything?
- Here.

01:11:11.042 --> 01:11:13.462
Angus, what's there?
What have you found?

01:11:13.542 --> 01:11:16.542
Over here! Dig.

01:11:18.208 --> 01:11:21.958
This ground's been disturbed.
There's something here.

01:11:27.667 --> 01:11:30.037
Help!

01:11:33.417 --> 01:11:35.127
Jesus.

01:11:41.583 --> 01:11:43.673
Dig. Dig!

01:11:44.958 --> 01:11:46.958
Here. Help me.

01:12:02.667 --> 01:12:04.787
Sammy.

01:12:04.917 --> 01:12:06.577
No. Sammy...

01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:23.170
They've gone.

01:12:27.042 --> 01:12:28.712
Fuck.

01:12:29.875 --> 01:12:31.125
Fuck.

01:12:31.292 --> 01:12:32.382
They've gone!

01:12:38.042 --> 01:12:40.132
Brian.

01:12:44.667 --> 01:12:46.417
Brian.

01:13:21.208 --> 01:13:22.958
Use your fucking head.

01:13:23.042 --> 01:13:25.502
Come on. Angus, keys!

01:13:58.833 --> 01:14:00.543
What the fuck?!

01:14:01.625 --> 01:14:04.125
What the fuck? That's impossible.

01:14:04.208 --> 01:14:06.328
What? Hold on.

01:14:08.917 --> 01:14:12.207
- What the fuck?!
- Come on. Come on, man, fucking go!

01:14:15.417 --> 01:14:16.417
Run.

01:14:24.292 --> 01:14:25.632
Over there!

01:14:28.542 --> 01:14:30.882
No guns except Al. Come on.

01:14:33.167 --> 01:14:34.827
Here. Come on.

01:14:36.292 --> 01:14:38.172
- Go, go!
- Vaughn.

01:15:21.042 --> 01:15:24.252
- Vaughn. Vaughn, get up. Vaughn.
- I guess I can't.

01:15:24.333 --> 01:15:27.463
- You have to run!
- I can't fucking move. Just go.

01:15:27.542 --> 01:15:31.792
- Come on.
- Fucking go, Marcus. Just fucking go!

01:15:36.250 --> 01:15:39.000
No, wait. Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

01:15:39.125 --> 01:15:42.495
Brian, no! Logan, do something.

01:15:42.583 --> 01:15:44.673
- He'll kill him.
- Get him away for fuck's sake!

01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:46.460
- Brian!
- Get him away!

01:15:46.542 --> 01:15:48.002
Brian!

01:15:48.083 --> 01:15:52.753
Al, take Rab. Take Johnny and Rab.
The other one, he went that way.

01:15:52.833 --> 01:15:54.923
Just you three.
I don't want a free-for-all.

01:15:55.042 --> 01:15:58.172
- Bring him in alive. Go!
- That fucker's mine!

01:15:58.250 --> 01:16:00.460
- We'll get the bastard.
- Stay in touch on the radio.

01:16:00.542 --> 01:16:02.212
Get Dad up here with the dogs.

01:16:02.292 --> 01:16:06.252
We'll take this one up to the farm,
find out what the fuck is going on here.

01:16:06.333 --> 01:16:08.383
Right.

01:17:28.708 --> 01:17:31.878
Tell us what happened. Everything.

01:17:49.292 --> 01:17:52.042
We were stalking deer
for about an hour, okay?

01:17:53.083 --> 01:17:55.293
And we found one in a clearing.

01:17:55.375 --> 01:17:57.745
I lined up the shot.
I lined up the shot.

01:20:07.417 --> 01:20:12.167
Any idea how sick this is,
what you've done?

01:20:13.833 --> 01:20:15.543
Sorry.

01:20:17.167 --> 01:20:19.247
That's not gonna be enough.

01:20:23.583 --> 01:20:25.883
That's not gonna be nearly enough.

01:20:38.375 --> 01:20:40.855
How could you have done this to us?
How could you not tell us?

01:20:46.750 --> 01:20:51.750
You... with a child of your own
on the way.

01:20:57.875 --> 01:21:00.205
- I'm so sorry.
- Stop saying that.

01:21:20.208 --> 01:21:22.248
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:21:23.833 --> 01:21:26.003
- He's not going anywhere.
- Sit down.

01:21:27.458 --> 01:21:29.538
We made a decision.
What, you don't think I want to?

01:21:39.625 --> 01:21:41.915
Well, let's get it done right now.

01:21:46.208 --> 01:21:50.078
- You're not thinking right, Brian.
- Oh, aye? And how's that?

01:21:52.917 --> 01:21:57.127
People know they came here.
His wife, for a start.

01:21:57.917 --> 01:22:01.537
Now, if we kill them, this place
will be riddled with police in no time.

01:22:01.625 --> 01:22:04.825
And I'm not talking local ones.
I'm talking real police.

01:22:05.667 --> 01:22:09.037
Last time anyone saw them was with us,
taking them out into the woods.

01:22:09.917 --> 01:22:13.667
Now, if we go through with this,
some of us'll go down for it,

01:22:13.750 --> 01:22:15.750
guaranteed, and for life.

01:22:20.542 --> 01:22:22.172
This place will never recover.

01:22:23.208 --> 01:22:25.418
And this family will be ripped apart.

01:22:28.333 --> 01:22:32.383
Now, I'm not saying I like it,
but it's time to get the police here.

01:22:37.750 --> 01:22:39.080
He's right.

01:22:39.208 --> 01:22:42.078
What real evidence have we got? Nothing.

01:22:42.167 --> 01:22:44.917
And he'll change his story
as soon as the fucking police get here.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.920
- No, I won't.
- He says that now.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.290
- I won't.
- Shut the fuck up.

01:22:48.375 --> 01:22:50.535
- Quiet.
- They walk away from this.

01:22:50.625 --> 01:22:54.165
- That cannae fucking happen.
- I said fucking quiet.

01:22:59.542 --> 01:23:02.462
I don't wanna hear another word
about police.

01:23:02.542 --> 01:23:04.712
After what he just confessed?

01:23:06.333 --> 01:23:09.583
After what came out the back
of that pick-up truck?

01:23:10.417 --> 01:23:12.667
After what these cunts have done here?

01:23:14.042 --> 01:23:17.002
The unthinkable things
they've done to our family?

01:23:26.708 --> 01:23:28.668
This can only be paid for in blood.

01:23:30.083 --> 01:23:33.883
We're not killers, brother.
We're not like them.

01:23:33.958 --> 01:23:36.078
An eye for an eye, Logan.

01:23:36.958 --> 01:23:41.498
After what they've done here,
they're not leaving here alive.

01:23:42.667 --> 01:23:46.077
For Christ's sake, stop this.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.880
- Think about what you're doing here.
- You've said your piece.

01:23:49.958 --> 01:23:53.288
Now step aside.

01:23:53.458 --> 01:23:55.288
- Angus...
- Logan, get out of my fucking way.

01:23:55.458 --> 01:23:57.248
- Frank, no.
- This is wrong.

01:23:57.333 --> 01:24:00.543
- I mean it. I'm warning you.
- It's the wrong thing to do.

01:24:00.625 --> 01:24:03.535
- Get him up.
- Brian! They've found the other one.

01:24:03.667 --> 01:24:05.877
They've got him!

01:24:07.917 --> 01:24:10.787
- Angus, get him in there.
- Get up.

01:24:12.083 --> 01:24:14.713
Get on your arse. Come on.

01:24:14.875 --> 01:24:16.165
Stay and watch him.

01:24:17.125 --> 01:24:20.535
Where is he? Vinny.

01:24:20.667 --> 01:24:22.577
We'll go and pick the other one up.

01:24:22.708 --> 01:24:25.208
We're gonna come back here
and finish this.

01:25:20.458 --> 01:25:22.788
A fucking kid! A fucking kid!

01:25:26.708 --> 01:25:29.708
You fucking tell them
what we've fucking done!

01:25:29.875 --> 01:25:31.285
What do you...

01:26:15.167 --> 01:26:17.287
Stop fucking moving.

01:26:28.833 --> 01:26:30.543
Come on.

01:27:02.042 --> 01:27:03.792
I've negotiated your life.

01:27:19.167 --> 01:27:20.667
But there's a debt to be paid.

01:27:35.625 --> 01:27:37.915
Don't think about doing anything stupid.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:39.920
You've got two guns
pointing at your head.

01:27:54.292 --> 01:27:56.382
Now do what needs to be done.

01:28:00.542 --> 01:28:02.792
Take it. Take it.

01:28:02.958 --> 01:28:04.578
No. No.

01:28:07.042 --> 01:28:10.502
Do it.
Come on, you can leave here alive.

01:28:10.583 --> 01:28:12.673
No. Fuck, no.

01:28:13.667 --> 01:28:15.627
Then you die here with him.

01:28:23.292 --> 01:28:26.582
- No, it's not right.
- Not right's a long way gone.

01:28:28.792 --> 01:28:30.882
Now do it.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:37.540
Do it or it's out of my control
and my brother will kill both of you.

01:29:07.042 --> 01:29:10.752
No, you can. Put it to your shoulder.
Put it to your shoulder.

01:29:10.833 --> 01:29:14.383
Son, son, just... just pick it up
and point it and pull the trigger.

01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:16.830
Pull the trigger.

01:29:17.917 --> 01:29:22.207
Do you really wanna leave your wife
and unborn child alone? Do you?

01:29:57.042 --> 01:29:58.712
Please.

01:30:06.125 --> 01:30:07.495
Please.

01:32:37.542 --> 01:32:39.382
Let's go through it again.

01:32:41.833 --> 01:32:44.153
Your wife picked you up.
And Marcus went north in his jeep.

01:32:50.958 --> 01:32:53.038
Marcus went north.

01:32:54.708 --> 01:32:56.628
Our relatives went missing.

01:32:59.542 --> 01:33:01.582
And we know nothing more.

01:33:03.542 --> 01:33:05.632
Nothing happened here.

01:33:07.875 --> 01:33:12.785
When the police come, keep your story
simple and make it convincing.

01:33:32.667 --> 01:33:34.747
What's happened? What's happened?

01:34:42.125 --> 01:34:44.205
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:34:45.583 --> 01:34:47.543
You okay?

01:34:50.583 --> 01:34:52.673
I'll get him. You stay there.

01:35:15.375 --> 01:35:17.535
Hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.
