WEBVTT

00:02.078 --> 00:03.977
Cumulostratus cloud cover moving in.

00:04.046 --> 00:07.081
Barometric readings
indicate a rising tropopause.

00:07.150 --> 00:08.617
In anticipation of a visit

00:08.617 --> 00:11.445
from the president of the
Royal Meteorological Society,

00:11.488 --> 00:14.222
I have completed construction
on a state-of-the-art instrument

00:14.291 --> 00:17.259
that will harness the
energy of the weather itself.

00:17.327 --> 00:20.495
I am just so excited to be inducted

00:20.564 --> 00:23.331
as an official Thunder Queen of the RMS.

00:23.400 --> 00:26.668
Oh, uh, only lead researchers
on a project get inducted.

00:26.737 --> 00:28.503
I'm going to be inducted?

00:28.572 --> 00:29.880
No, I am!

00:30.074 --> 00:31.640
This is my experiment.

00:31.709 --> 00:34.376
Abortion Deb, you did
draw up the schematics.

00:34.445 --> 00:36.812
I designed the equipment
and did all the math.

00:36.880 --> 00:39.781
And I paid the $6 application fee.

00:39.850 --> 00:42.417
Which is why I will be
supervising the event

00:42.486 --> 00:44.419
from a safe distance,
preparing for my new title...

00:44.488 --> 00:45.987
A scheming bitch?

00:46.056 --> 00:48.256
Conduct the experiment yourself

00:48.325 --> 00:50.792
since you're the lead researcher.

00:50.861 --> 00:52.294
- Hmpf!
- Abortion Deb, Cornetta?

00:52.362 --> 00:53.528
Girls? Come back!

00:53.597 --> 00:55.197
I can't do this without you!

00:56.266 --> 00:57.866
Who will hold my poles?

00:57.935 --> 00:59.568
Are you almost done with this room?

00:59.636 --> 01:01.656
Mayor Cutie wants to take a shit in here.

01:02.272 --> 01:03.638
Sisters.

01:03.707 --> 01:06.241
I have a rare opportunity for you.

01:06.310 --> 01:08.243
Ooh! Invitations to your second funeral?

01:10.637 --> 01:13.271
Imagine the chance to
participate in an experiment

01:13.296 --> 01:16.561
that will change forever the way we look at

01:16.905 --> 01:17.977
weather.

01:17.978 --> 01:20.612
Hortense, apart from the
civil rights of poor people,

01:20.680 --> 01:22.313
there's nothing more
boring than the weather.

01:22.338 --> 01:23.258
Ugh.

01:23.302 --> 01:25.014
I certainly hope you're joking.

01:27.768 --> 01:28.934
For the weather...

01:29.975 --> 01:31.274
Is my life.

01:31.334 --> 01:33.849
I am Juan Pablo El Castillo,

01:34.178 --> 01:36.749
and I have come all the way from Barcelona

01:37.047 --> 01:38.457
to meet Hortense.

01:39.183 --> 01:40.446
And to make love...

01:41.218 --> 01:42.334
to her mind.

01:43.819 --> 01:44.953
Hello, Doctor.

01:45.022 --> 01:46.119
I love the weather!

01:46.144 --> 01:47.256
Me too!

01:47.324 --> 01:48.490
Except for rain.

01:48.559 --> 01:49.725
And snow.

01:49.793 --> 01:50.893
And gentle breezes.

01:50.961 --> 01:52.060
Yes, uh,

01:52.129 --> 01:53.395
we like our breezes rough.

01:53.464 --> 01:54.967
- Mm-hmm.
- Hmm.

02:16.584 --> 02:18.776
Madam, you've hardly
touched your dessert pillars.

02:18.963 --> 02:20.763
Is the croquembouche not
towered to your liking?

02:20.832 --> 02:23.232
We could add a spire of plum butter

02:23.301 --> 02:24.900
to the summit if you prefer.

02:24.969 --> 02:27.058
No, it's not the pillars.

02:27.605 --> 02:30.506
It's just that life has become less sunny

02:30.575 --> 02:32.508
since I've discontinued my morphine use.

02:32.577 --> 02:34.510
My God, Madam, I'll
inject you straight away.

02:34.579 --> 02:35.892
No, Peepers.

02:36.202 --> 02:38.848
I think not being on morphine
is ultimately better for me

02:38.916 --> 02:40.516
than being on morphine.

02:40.585 --> 02:42.151
Well, I'm not a doctor,
but that sounds like

02:42.220 --> 02:43.719
a load of piffle.

02:43.788 --> 02:47.707
I need something to invigorate the spirit.

02:48.092 --> 02:50.659
Some adventure.

02:50.728 --> 02:53.062
Perhaps something involving
the great outdoors.

02:53.130 --> 02:54.463
Oh, no, Madam.

02:54.532 --> 02:56.465
At your age, even the lesser outdoors

02:56.534 --> 02:57.844
could kill you.

03:01.801 --> 03:03.340
I have an idea.

03:04.008 --> 03:05.828
A pleasure cruise.

03:06.191 --> 03:07.943
Well, if I can't get high,

03:08.012 --> 03:10.145
at least I can get on the high seas!

03:14.886 --> 03:16.752
I'm sure you get this all the time,

03:16.821 --> 03:18.921
but what is rain?

03:18.990 --> 03:21.056
When water condenses in the atmosphere...

03:21.125 --> 03:22.758
What language are you speaking?

03:22.827 --> 03:24.426
I can't believe it's finally happening.

03:24.495 --> 03:26.428
Sex with a Spanish male has been atop both

03:26.497 --> 03:28.097
of our bucket lists for years.

03:28.165 --> 03:30.099
It's the only thing our
lists have in common.

03:30.167 --> 03:31.767
Mine mostly involves technology

03:31.836 --> 03:32.935
that hasn't been invented yet,

03:33.004 --> 03:34.774
like a mechanical Beatrice.

03:34.906 --> 03:36.772
Mine is to figure out what a bucket is.

03:37.902 --> 03:40.069
The goal of my experiment

03:40.344 --> 03:42.978
is to attract lightning,

03:43.047 --> 03:46.482
and then use the energy
as a controlled force.

03:46.550 --> 03:48.484
At least there's something
out there we can control.

03:48.552 --> 03:49.558
Ladies.

03:49.669 --> 03:51.703
A storm is like a bull...

03:51.772 --> 03:53.705
wild and unpredictable.

03:54.181 --> 03:55.355
But like a bull,

03:55.515 --> 03:56.640
it can be tamed.

03:56.640 --> 03:58.246
Oh, you can tame me if you pull my hair.

03:58.271 --> 03:59.473
Me too!

03:59.543 --> 04:00.976
Also, it helps if you call me chambermaid

04:01.044 --> 04:02.177
while you pull.

04:02.513 --> 04:03.479
This part's fake.

04:03.548 --> 04:05.481
Yes, and Juan Pablo,

04:05.550 --> 04:07.146
as every matador knows,

04:07.146 --> 04:10.478
to truly dominate the
bull, one must be safe.

04:10.503 --> 04:12.070
That is completely wrong.

04:12.138 --> 04:14.072
- What?
- You must be a risk taker.

04:14.140 --> 04:15.940
Yes, well, no disrespect,
but what do you know

04:16.009 --> 04:17.766
- about bullfighting?
- I'm Spanish.

04:18.345 --> 04:20.002
And a professional bullfighter.

04:20.613 --> 04:21.946
And I published a book called

04:22.015 --> 04:23.748
"How the Weather Is Like a Bull."

04:25.051 --> 04:26.980
It sold 1 million copies.

04:27.187 --> 04:28.753
Yes, well, off to the woods.

04:28.822 --> 04:30.054
Let's just hope no one gets killed.

04:34.694 --> 04:36.471
<i>I've never been so excited.</i>

04:36.696 --> 04:38.563
Lady Dodo and myself,

04:38.632 --> 04:40.846
all alone for a whole day.

04:42.135 --> 04:43.935
Well, Lady Dodo, myself, and the captain.

04:44.971 --> 04:46.118
And the deckhands.

04:46.143 --> 04:47.671
<i>And the chef.</i>

04:47.807 --> 04:49.447
<i>And the other guests,
and their staffs.</i>

04:49.560 --> 04:50.685
The orchestra,

04:50.685 --> 04:52.952
and the electro-technical
officer, and the boatswain,

04:53.021 --> 04:55.588
and the able seamen,
and the ordinary seamen.

04:55.906 --> 04:56.905
<i>But other than that...</i>

04:58.442 --> 04:59.508
Alone.

05:00.811 --> 05:02.244
This is your cabin, Madam.

05:05.449 --> 05:08.416
One canopy bed, Captain?

05:08.485 --> 05:11.586
I suppose I'll be sleeping
where I nap like a commoner.

05:11.874 --> 05:14.942
And through here are quarters for your man.

05:17.052 --> 05:18.627
My own cot?

05:18.794 --> 05:21.629
Is this a pleasure cruise,
or a paradise cruise?

05:21.697 --> 05:23.330
Now, sir, if you must pass water,

05:23.399 --> 05:25.399
you may do so over the side of the ship.

05:25.468 --> 05:27.401
If you have to defecate, you must hold it.

05:27.470 --> 05:29.071
My good man, I always hold it.

05:30.337 --> 05:33.107
The fresh air, the open sea.

05:33.175 --> 05:36.110
We're really roughing it now, Peepers!

05:36.178 --> 05:38.612
Not I, Madam. I fear I may grow spoiled

05:38.681 --> 05:40.714
with these lavish accommodations.

05:55.703 --> 05:57.510
Where is your rain gear?

05:57.535 --> 05:59.835
- This is my rain gear.
- I'm not wearing rain gear.

05:59.904 --> 06:01.570
- I'm trying to [BLEEP].
- I need you focused!

06:01.639 --> 06:04.807
These two rods will harness
the energy of the lightning.

06:04.876 --> 06:07.324
If they are not firmly in the ground,

06:07.324 --> 06:09.424
someone could be electrocuted.

06:09.774 --> 06:12.522
Now hold your poles in place,
and don't screw this up!

06:13.378 --> 06:15.445
Biblioteca Gracias is mine.

06:15.513 --> 06:16.646
He's hot-blooded.

06:16.714 --> 06:18.514
He's not interested in your anemic beauty.

06:18.582 --> 06:20.285
- Can't we both have him?
- Of course not!

06:20.332 --> 06:21.593
Here's how it goes.

06:21.593 --> 06:23.426
I say what I want, and you
acquiesce to my demands.

06:23.495 --> 06:25.028
He's mine, say it!

06:25.096 --> 06:26.429
- He's mine!
- He's mine!

06:26.498 --> 06:27.597
He's mine!

06:27.666 --> 06:29.014
He's mine!

06:30.836 --> 06:31.968
Ow!

06:39.244 --> 06:40.743
He's on my bucket list!

06:40.812 --> 06:42.245
My bucket list!

06:47.018 --> 06:48.218
No, no, no, no!

06:48.286 --> 06:50.086
Don't cross the lightning rods!

06:50.155 --> 06:51.621
Are you insane?

06:51.690 --> 06:52.922
You'll both be electrocuted.

06:52.991 --> 06:54.557
No! Give it!

06:54.626 --> 06:55.592
Ladies, please...

06:55.660 --> 06:57.075
Stop!

06:58.296 --> 06:59.943
Give. Me. That.

07:00.232 --> 07:01.788
Pole!

07:03.635 --> 07:04.759
Oh, my God.

07:05.670 --> 07:06.903
Oh, my God!

07:06.972 --> 07:08.235
We've killed him.

07:08.573 --> 07:11.307
And against all odds, it had
nothing to do with the weather!

07:15.442 --> 07:16.708
I think I'm...

07:16.799 --> 07:18.032
I'm actually...

07:18.057 --> 07:19.215
I'm actually okay.

07:24.089 --> 07:26.155
What does "okay" mean in English?

07:28.260 --> 07:29.525
And if we are very lucky,

07:29.594 --> 07:31.294
we may even see whales.

07:31.363 --> 07:33.800
Majestic, clever creatures, whales.

07:34.199 --> 07:36.199
With emotions and language.

07:36.268 --> 07:37.810
Complex social ties.

07:38.169 --> 07:40.670
As God as my witness, nothing feels better

07:40.739 --> 07:42.213
than killing a whale.

07:43.108 --> 07:45.041
Harpoons will be available on all decks.

07:50.615 --> 07:52.548
Sweet merciful Poseidon.

07:56.054 --> 07:57.420
A sea twister.

07:59.891 --> 08:02.292
Everyone, return to your cabins at once.

08:02.360 --> 08:03.960
What about the lifeboats?

08:04.029 --> 08:05.595
Do you have any idea what
happens to a 12-foot boat

08:05.664 --> 08:07.530
when it's crushed by a 30-foot wave?

08:07.599 --> 08:09.132
- Well, of course not.
- No one does!

08:09.157 --> 08:10.523
No one's ever lived through it.

08:10.548 --> 08:12.481
We are not long for this world.

08:12.637 --> 08:14.111
Now...

08:16.074 --> 08:17.040
Panic!

08:21.680 --> 08:23.012
We must get you to safety!

08:23.081 --> 08:24.080
- Oh.
- This way!

08:24.149 --> 08:25.515
This way, quickly.

08:25.583 --> 08:26.660
Quickly!

08:40.044 --> 08:41.998
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

08:42.067 --> 08:42.999
We killed him.

08:43.068 --> 08:44.334
My science killed him.

08:44.402 --> 08:45.601
What are we going to do?

08:45.670 --> 08:47.837
I had a story like this read to me once!

08:47.906 --> 08:49.505
It was called "Slipper Beauty,"

08:49.574 --> 08:52.008
and it says to tongue him
till he comes back to life.

08:52.077 --> 08:53.582
You don't tell me twice.

08:56.948 --> 08:57.981
Well, you must not be his true love

08:58.049 --> 08:59.482
because he's not coming back to life.

09:02.887 --> 09:04.721
- No!
- You're not doing it right!

09:04.789 --> 09:05.960
Get off!

09:09.761 --> 09:11.138
I want...

09:13.025 --> 09:15.565
No, no! Stop it! Stop it!

09:17.203 --> 09:19.270
We need a real plan!

09:21.706 --> 09:23.406
Ooh, Hortense, taking it all the way.

09:23.475 --> 09:24.640
- Impressive.
- No!

09:24.709 --> 09:27.110
I am just trying to pick him up.

09:27.178 --> 09:29.245
- But he's stiff.
- That makes two of us.

09:29.314 --> 09:31.180
What are we going to do?

09:31.249 --> 09:33.059
We'll probably go to prison for life.

09:33.385 --> 09:35.084
Of course, a rich person's
prison is better than

09:35.153 --> 09:37.320
the most extravagant
poor person's vacation,

09:37.389 --> 09:38.494
but still.

09:39.290 --> 09:40.757
We have to get rid of the body.

09:44.095 --> 09:45.709
- Oh!
- Whoa!

09:45.964 --> 09:47.230
Oh, Peepers.

09:47.986 --> 09:49.500
I don't want to die.

09:49.567 --> 09:51.134
I'm frightened.

09:51.202 --> 09:54.032
- Hold me?
- Anything for you, Lady Dodo.

09:56.307 --> 09:58.941
Hamish, we saw a gopher
in the raspberry bushes.

09:59.010 --> 10:00.127
Got it.

10:01.546 --> 10:03.479
- Where's the corpse?
- In the woods.

10:03.548 --> 10:04.614
By the servant burial heap.

10:04.682 --> 10:06.482
- Hmm.
- You've done this before?

10:06.551 --> 10:07.917
Of course. What else did you think

10:07.986 --> 10:09.218
I did around here?

10:09.287 --> 10:10.920
You've done this before?

10:10.989 --> 10:12.255
What's that now?

10:12.323 --> 10:14.857
Could you just make it
look like an accident?

10:14.926 --> 10:17.760
No, I'm going to make it look
like an intentional homicide

10:17.829 --> 10:19.830
and leave a trail of clues

10:19.855 --> 10:21.855
all leading back to you.

10:21.900 --> 10:24.033
Of course I'm going to make
it look like an accident,

10:24.102 --> 10:25.134
you dumb ox!

10:25.203 --> 10:26.912
Now act like you've done this before.

10:27.238 --> 10:28.871
I haven't!

10:28.940 --> 10:30.773
Any more notes from the expert, then,

10:30.842 --> 10:33.704
before I go out there and
clean up your stupid mess?

10:33.729 --> 10:34.911
Just get rid of him!

10:34.979 --> 10:36.979
I'll pay your standard rate in the morning.

10:37.048 --> 10:38.047
You have done this before!

10:38.116 --> 10:39.115
What's that now?

10:39.184 --> 10:40.624
Get the [BLEEP] out of my shed.

10:45.590 --> 10:47.123
Hold me closer.

10:47.192 --> 10:48.224
Yes, Madam.

10:52.997 --> 10:54.500
Now kiss me.

10:54.766 --> 10:55.719
What?

10:57.602 --> 10:58.734
Kiss me, damn you.

10:58.803 --> 10:59.770
Madam...

11:09.414 --> 11:10.813
Take me, Peepers!

11:10.882 --> 11:12.415
How would you like to be taken, Madam?

11:12.484 --> 11:14.183
Any way! Every way!

11:14.252 --> 11:15.718
Just tell me what to do.

11:15.787 --> 11:17.053
Me tell you what to do?

11:17.122 --> 11:18.254
Madam, I cannot.

11:18.323 --> 11:19.740
I'm ordering you...

11:20.024 --> 11:21.290
to order me.

11:23.528 --> 11:25.428
- Lady Dodo...
- Yes?

11:25.497 --> 11:27.029
Get that ass in the air.

11:59.731 --> 12:01.964
Dodo, I'm bleeding.

12:03.453 --> 12:04.604
Peepers.

12:04.802 --> 12:06.335
- Don't tell me...
- Yes.

12:07.599 --> 12:09.188
It was my first time.

12:20.815 --> 12:22.115
What's wrong? What's wrong?

12:22.183 --> 12:23.316
I forgot my dream.

12:23.385 --> 12:24.550
Don't you hate it when that happens?

12:24.619 --> 12:26.214
There's something in your bed, sir.

12:31.459 --> 12:32.592
I'll get the police!

12:32.661 --> 12:34.127
I'll get the police!

12:36.097 --> 12:37.656
Frederick, you old dog.

12:40.468 --> 12:42.540
Good morning.

12:42.825 --> 12:44.892
- We're alive?
- Yes!

12:44.961 --> 12:48.095
The storm veered off
course at the last moment.

12:48.164 --> 12:51.131
But the captain said that
the ship was breaking apart.

12:51.200 --> 12:53.100
Yes, I'm told he always says that,

12:53.169 --> 12:54.114
but...

12:55.037 --> 12:56.570
We are safe and sound.

12:57.006 --> 12:59.216
Speaking of which, you made a sound

12:59.241 --> 13:02.042
that was positively jaguar-ian last night.

13:03.880 --> 13:07.357
Well, now I thought we could start the day

13:07.381 --> 13:09.281
with a bit of shuffleboard,

13:09.350 --> 13:13.238
and then begin our lives
as we've always dreamt:

13:13.954 --> 13:14.919
together.

13:14.948 --> 13:15.955
Together?

13:15.995 --> 13:16.994
Yes!

13:17.019 --> 13:18.868
Just as we said we would

13:18.950 --> 13:21.698
whilst in the throes of lovemaking

13:21.766 --> 13:25.047
and believing we were about to die.

13:29.908 --> 13:31.908
Okay, sweet Frederick.

13:31.976 --> 13:34.310
We'll be asking you a
few questions, won't we?

13:34.379 --> 13:37.580
And remember to be
honest, as lies bring cries

13:37.649 --> 13:39.649
to the baby Jesus' eyes.

13:39.717 --> 13:41.951
You killed the foreign
fella, didn't you, Frederick?

13:42.441 --> 13:43.773
What? No.

13:43.847 --> 13:45.613
Don't play dumb with us,

13:45.638 --> 13:47.076
you pockmarked son of a bitch.

13:47.120 --> 13:48.186
Ya murdered him.

13:48.254 --> 13:49.721
Right did.

13:49.789 --> 13:51.155
Can I have some Turkish delight?

13:51.224 --> 13:52.523
Of course, child.

13:53.658 --> 13:54.685
Stop!

13:55.193 --> 13:57.360
First, we're gonna need you to draw

13:57.429 --> 14:00.363
how you killed the man
on that sheet of paper.

14:00.432 --> 14:04.290
Aye, a hand drawn picture
is always the crown jewel

14:04.322 --> 14:05.957
of a coerced confession.

14:06.603 --> 14:07.704
Fine.

14:11.810 --> 14:13.026
Okay, okay.

14:15.380 --> 14:17.313
This is where I shot the man.

14:17.382 --> 14:19.949
And then I smashed his legs with a hammer.

14:20.018 --> 14:20.984
No. No!

14:21.052 --> 14:22.452
No, stop it!

14:22.521 --> 14:23.897
Put the candy down.

14:24.189 --> 14:27.047
Listen, that man was
smashed about the head.

14:27.539 --> 14:31.260
So you need to draw a lead
pipe smashing his head.

14:34.457 --> 14:35.519
All done.

14:35.734 --> 14:38.535
Very good, Mr. Vice President.

14:38.603 --> 14:41.321
Yes, sir, enjoy the candy, okay.

14:41.346 --> 14:43.480
Now draw me a naked lady.

14:43.935 --> 14:45.435
That'll be nice for later.

14:45.503 --> 14:46.669
Give her a penis.

14:50.208 --> 14:52.113
Why would that idiot Hamish

14:52.113 --> 14:53.746
put Juan Pablo in Frederick's bed?

14:53.814 --> 14:55.714
I know. That's my favorite place to sleep.

14:55.783 --> 14:57.616
Are we really going to
do this to our brother?

14:57.685 --> 14:59.054
Wait, that's our brother?

14:59.353 --> 15:01.231
Sorry, I'm really bad with faces.

15:02.384 --> 15:03.467
Yes.

15:03.492 --> 15:04.957
What? I'm an asshole when I'm nervous.

15:05.026 --> 15:06.764
You must be nervous a lot!

15:07.061 --> 15:08.164
And you.

15:08.164 --> 15:10.638
You're really going to
do this to Frederick?

15:10.717 --> 15:12.983
Normally I'd say no, but
he sent me to a nunnery,

15:13.052 --> 15:14.685
so having him hang for
a murder he didn't commit

15:14.754 --> 15:16.554
- only seems fair.
- Someone's going to jail

15:16.622 --> 15:18.255
for this body, and it's not going to be me.

15:18.324 --> 15:20.157
Surely they're going to find us out.

15:20.226 --> 15:22.026
- Should I burn my clothes?
- You know, that's probably

15:22.095 --> 15:23.761
a good idea from a fashion perspective.

15:23.830 --> 15:25.396
Your clothes look so bad
when you're wearing them.

15:25.465 --> 15:26.497
- Please do.
- Really.

15:26.566 --> 15:27.631
You just dress terribly.

15:27.700 --> 15:29.233
Burn everything now.

15:29.302 --> 15:30.968
Your face matches your little lace thing,

15:31.037 --> 15:33.204
and it feels like you kind
of, like, threw up lace,

15:33.272 --> 15:34.805
and then you just left it there,

15:34.874 --> 15:36.207
and then you're, like...

15:36.275 --> 15:37.475
All the way down, and you're, like,

15:37.543 --> 15:39.009
"This is my wardrobe forever."

15:39.078 --> 15:40.282
Commit suicide.

15:47.420 --> 15:49.587
Well, I was thinking we should probably

15:49.655 --> 15:51.188
keep our love secret at first,

15:51.257 --> 15:53.057
at least until you've told the girls,

15:53.126 --> 15:55.059
and in time, I hope they
can come to think of me

15:55.128 --> 15:56.738
as their father.

15:56.738 --> 15:58.696
As for the house, I
will continue to run it.

15:58.765 --> 16:01.565
Naturally, we'll need to
find a new butler eventually.

16:01.634 --> 16:03.734
As for the wedding, I think
we should keep it simple.

16:03.803 --> 16:05.182
Elegant, of course.

16:05.182 --> 16:07.605
I was thinking an "Arabian Nights" theme.

16:07.673 --> 16:09.807
Peepers, we need to talk.

16:09.876 --> 16:12.510
Oh, I could talk the day
away with you, my darling.

16:12.578 --> 16:15.045
People say things when
they're about to die.

16:15.114 --> 16:18.215
I'm certain you also said
things you didn't mean,

16:18.284 --> 16:22.155
and I think maybe it's best
if we just kept things casual.

16:24.357 --> 16:25.589
Casual?

16:25.658 --> 16:26.824
Yes!

16:26.893 --> 16:28.759
- Yes, of course!
- Ah.

16:28.828 --> 16:30.261
Casual.

16:30.329 --> 16:32.897
What is a butler, if not casual?

16:32.965 --> 16:33.931
Think of it,

16:33.931 --> 16:35.864
a butler marrying his mistress.

16:35.932 --> 16:37.098
- Absurd.
- Ooh!

16:44.657 --> 16:46.219
I'm back.

16:46.289 --> 16:49.189
How are my angels and Hortense?

16:54.397 --> 16:55.470
Mother!

16:55.698 --> 16:57.198
You'll never guess what happened.

16:57.198 --> 16:59.533
I killed a man with a lead
pipe, and then we slept together.

16:59.602 --> 17:01.435
We've got the confession right here.

17:01.504 --> 17:02.870
- I can't...
- Shh, shh.

17:02.939 --> 17:04.665
Frederick, did you kill anybody?

17:05.174 --> 17:08.142
- No.
- I need to know the truth.

17:08.166 --> 17:09.633
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

17:09.944 --> 17:11.233
I didn't do it.

17:11.233 --> 17:13.953
Well, then why did you
say all of the things?

17:13.992 --> 17:15.674
How did you come up with it?

17:16.395 --> 17:18.878
- Guessing.
- What do you mean guessing?

17:19.510 --> 17:20.740
I guessed.

17:20.740 --> 17:23.279
Frederick, that's not
something to guess about.

17:23.279 --> 17:24.342
<i>Buenos días.</i>

17:26.261 --> 17:27.363
Am I wet here?

17:27.387 --> 17:28.737
I'm wet here.

17:29.810 --> 17:31.543
Did no one check his pulse?

17:31.611 --> 17:32.977
No, I did.

17:33.046 --> 17:34.979
I told his heart beat once for alive,

17:35.048 --> 17:36.977
and twice for dead, and it did twice.

17:38.169 --> 17:39.769
Wait, now I'm confused.

17:39.837 --> 17:41.003
Did I kill him or not?

17:42.974 --> 17:44.073
Someone tell me!

17:49.061 --> 17:50.690
Oh, how was the cruise?

17:50.741 --> 17:52.074
Wonderful. Thank you, Garfield.

17:52.142 --> 17:53.805
Oh, that's good.

17:56.846 --> 17:57.937
Actually,

17:58.415 --> 17:59.781
it wasn't wonderful.

17:59.849 --> 18:00.930
Oh?

18:01.718 --> 18:02.997
I met a lady.

18:03.520 --> 18:05.419
Oh, what a lady.

18:05.755 --> 18:07.387
I grew enamored with her.

18:07.591 --> 18:08.801
Bewitched.

18:09.077 --> 18:11.629
And I thought she was
enamored with me, but...

18:12.098 --> 18:15.725
it turns out my feelings
for her were just mirages.

18:15.750 --> 18:16.916
What shall I do?

18:16.985 --> 18:18.150
Shall I chase after her

18:18.219 --> 18:20.215
like a hound chasing a fox,

18:20.270 --> 18:24.139
or does one have pride
and wait upon one's roost,

18:24.208 --> 18:27.075
like the cock crowing at the morn?

18:27.144 --> 18:30.812
I've never been anything
but there for her, you know?

18:30.881 --> 18:33.648
And now she just treats
me as if I am just somebody

18:33.717 --> 18:35.475
that she used to know.

18:35.572 --> 18:37.138
Somebody.

18:37.163 --> 18:38.729
Well, your problem is that you're looking

18:38.754 --> 18:41.622
for comfort and support
in the arms of a woman.

18:41.935 --> 18:44.603
That's like going to the
latrine for drinking water.

18:44.671 --> 18:48.060
It might quench your thirst,
but you'll end up with listeria.

18:48.275 --> 18:50.075
The thing to do is move on.

18:50.100 --> 18:53.101
But how do I do that,
sir, when she's right...

18:53.126 --> 18:54.459
When she's right...

18:54.575 --> 18:56.508
Oh-ho-ho!
There you are.

18:56.533 --> 18:58.299
I've been looking everywhere for you.

18:58.358 --> 18:59.987
- I'm here.
- Doctor.

19:00.454 --> 19:04.189
Prepare me something so
that I shan't feel my face.

19:04.258 --> 19:06.057
- Allow me, Madam.
- Oh. No, no, no.

19:06.126 --> 19:07.814
I don't need you, Peepers.

19:10.297 --> 19:12.230
You know, I... I'm thinking of it,

19:12.299 --> 19:14.266
and perhaps you should try a melon.

19:14.334 --> 19:16.768
You know, the simplest
relationship I ever had

19:16.837 --> 19:18.870
was with a cantaloupe named Luther.

19:22.909 --> 19:24.276
You wanted to see me, sir?

19:24.344 --> 19:25.640
Come in. Come in.

19:26.780 --> 19:27.733
Well,

19:28.474 --> 19:30.719
there's no easy way to say
this, so I'll just say it.

19:30.744 --> 19:32.110
I'm leaving Bellacourt.

19:33.713 --> 19:35.446
Another harbor cruise?

19:35.515 --> 19:36.587
No!

19:37.183 --> 19:38.302
This time,

19:38.583 --> 19:39.916
I'm leaving for good.

19:40.953 --> 19:42.119
But... but...

19:42.188 --> 19:43.353
- But why?
- Never mind why,

19:43.422 --> 19:45.122
- you impudent bug!
- Oh.

19:45.191 --> 19:47.091
You are the head butler now.

19:47.159 --> 19:48.492
No.

19:48.561 --> 19:50.894
Responsibilities of the great house

19:50.963 --> 19:52.996
have fallen upon your shoulders.

19:53.065 --> 19:56.734
May you join the top stair

19:57.503 --> 19:59.219
of the downstair life.

19:59.772 --> 20:01.505
Ah, your lapel!

20:01.574 --> 20:02.706
Yes, my lapel.

20:04.287 --> 20:08.228
I've ripped it as sign to
signify the end of my tenure here

20:08.253 --> 20:09.319
in Bellacourt.

20:09.319 --> 20:11.319
And now your tenure begins, boy.

20:11.850 --> 20:13.292
Remember what I told you.

20:13.316 --> 20:14.702
Dead eyes.

20:15.006 --> 20:17.255
Dead eye. That's it.

20:17.294 --> 20:19.279
- You're ready.
- I'm your, just...

20:20.013 --> 20:21.303
my old friend.

20:23.108 --> 20:24.232
No tears.

20:24.701 --> 20:25.990
Dead eyes.

20:25.990 --> 20:27.552
Dead eyes, dead heart.

20:28.420 --> 20:31.342
Now... there's silver to be polished.

20:31.381 --> 20:32.693
Go ahead, buttle boy.

20:32.952 --> 20:34.318
You're the head butler now.

20:34.387 --> 20:36.296
I'm the head butler now?

20:36.986 --> 20:38.519
I'm the head butler now.

20:39.105 --> 20:40.296
Dead eyes, old boy.

20:44.304 --> 20:45.869
