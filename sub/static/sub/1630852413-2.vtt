WEBVTT

00:07.257 --> 00:08.341
Thank you.

00:08.425 --> 00:09.467
Good morning.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.469
Good morning, my loves.

00:12.178 --> 00:15.682
I just sent you a detailed spreadsheet
with this week's to-do list,

00:15.765 --> 00:17.767
doctor and dentist appointments,

00:17.851 --> 00:21.938
class schedules and exam dates,
in case you forgot to study.

00:22.647 --> 00:25.859
And your hair appointment, honey.
You need a trim.

00:25.942 --> 00:28.653
Mom, is everything okay?
Why are you so well-dressed?

00:28.737 --> 00:32.115
Because, well, I know I promised I'd stay

00:32.198 --> 00:35.702
an entire year with Regi… with Valentina…

00:36.619 --> 00:38.538
but I'm going back to work.

00:38.621 --> 00:40.290
-Officially?
-Yes.

00:40.373 --> 00:41.207
That's great!

00:42.542 --> 00:44.794
Sorry, Mom, I'm just happy for you.

00:45.503 --> 00:48.256
You were going crazy
with her at home, huh?

00:48.757 --> 00:50.550
-Rodrigo.
-It's okay, honey.

00:50.633 --> 00:52.635
I appreciate constructive criticism.

00:52.719 --> 00:55.138
It pinpoints
an area of improvement for me.

00:55.221 --> 00:58.600
Besides, I was dying to go back to work.

00:59.476 --> 01:00.769
Officially.

01:01.436 --> 01:02.270
And Valentina?

01:02.896 --> 01:05.148
Sorry, I overslept.

01:09.027 --> 01:11.404
This is something I meant to tell you…

01:11.905 --> 01:15.075
Last night, Valentina
wouldn't stop crying. She cried and cried.

01:15.158 --> 01:17.494
She didn't want anything,
not even her bottle.

01:17.577 --> 01:20.955
So, I called Mariana
for her to come sleep over.

01:23.333 --> 01:25.043
I couldn't let her starve, honey.

01:25.126 --> 01:28.171
No, I breastfed her and she fell asleep.

01:29.297 --> 01:31.382
Oh! I have to go now.

01:33.426 --> 01:35.261
Have a good day. Please…

01:35.345 --> 01:37.847
let Mariana in on all of the house rules.

01:37.931 --> 01:40.975
Tell her loud and clear. Thanks, see you.

01:44.145 --> 01:45.772
I have to go to work too.

01:45.855 --> 01:47.732
What about the house rules?

01:47.816 --> 01:49.901
Don't worry. If you have any questions…

01:49.984 --> 01:51.236
just ask Altagracia.

01:52.654 --> 01:53.780
Be good. Bye.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.326
Is that my pajama shirt?

02:01.955 --> 02:04.624
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

03:02.015 --> 03:04.058
Ana, wait. What's happening?

03:05.435 --> 03:09.439
Honey, last night I didn't say anything
because you were sound asleep.

03:09.522 --> 03:11.816
-What about this morning?
-Forgive me.

03:12.650 --> 03:15.695
Frankly, I'm surprised
about what I did. It's just that…

03:15.778 --> 03:18.114
Valentina's crying was breaking my heart.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.992
And I was terribly upset
not knowing about Regina.

03:21.910 --> 03:24.120
You don't know
the neighborhood they were in.

03:25.955 --> 03:27.248
I miss her too.

03:27.749 --> 03:30.293
It'll be easier for her
if she doesn't see us.

03:30.376 --> 03:31.211
You think so?

03:33.213 --> 03:35.006
Look, it's temporary.

03:35.632 --> 03:37.884
Just until we wean Valentina,

03:37.967 --> 03:39.302
so she doesn't suffer.

03:40.220 --> 03:43.306
Besides, this way
we can have Regina a few more days.

03:45.391 --> 03:47.852
It'll be a win-win situation
for everyone, you'll see.

03:48.770 --> 03:49.896
Okay, I have to go.

03:51.606 --> 03:53.274
Bye, honey, see you tonight.

04:03.534 --> 04:06.412
The thing is, when you breastfeed,
you fucking starve.

04:07.872 --> 04:11.209
One of the house rules
is you can't curse at the table.

04:11.834 --> 04:12.919
Or anywhere else.

04:13.002 --> 04:15.171
"Fucking" is not a bad word 
in this context.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.839
Well, anyway,

04:16.923 --> 04:19.717
when you breastfeed,
you get freaking hungry.

04:23.012 --> 04:26.015
So you don't get your shirt dirty.

04:27.642 --> 04:30.270
We have to go to school now.
Right, Rodrigo?

04:31.145 --> 04:32.188
Let's go. bye!

04:34.983 --> 04:37.151
You just hit the jackpot.

04:37.235 --> 04:39.529
My bosses are really good people.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.657
What's up with the house rules?

04:42.740 --> 04:44.826
The only rule you need to know

04:44.909 --> 04:47.996
is that Mrs. Ana
rules in this house, that's all.

04:48.913 --> 04:49.747
Okay.

04:50.665 --> 04:53.876
Hey, would you happen to have…
eggs or something?

04:53.960 --> 04:55.253
Of course.

04:55.336 --> 04:57.255
Eggs, chilaquiles,

04:57.338 --> 04:58.756
beans, anything you want.

04:58.840 --> 04:59.882
Thanks.

05:02.760 --> 05:04.262
-Here's your coffee.
-Thanks.

05:04.345 --> 05:06.639
The sales reports
are ready in your office.

05:06.723 --> 05:10.268
-I love how this floor smells.
-I'll find out who the cleaner is.

05:10.351 --> 05:11.978
No, find out…

05:12.061 --> 05:14.397
how to wean a baby, ASAP.

05:15.898 --> 05:16.733
Ana.

05:17.233 --> 05:18.109
Amazing, huh?

05:18.192 --> 05:20.403
How do you manage
to look like this after a baby?

05:20.486 --> 05:21.321
Manolo.

05:23.323 --> 05:26.909
Cyn, do you have the documents
I asked for, for Yumiko?

05:27.493 --> 05:28.911
Yes, I'll send them to you.

05:28.995 --> 05:31.497
Okay, you'll tell me your secret later.

05:33.499 --> 05:34.751
What was that?

05:34.834 --> 05:38.338
Manolo is taking charge
of the products stuck in customs.

05:38.838 --> 05:41.049
And he made an offer for me
to work with him

05:42.216 --> 05:44.344
and get you someone else
for when you came back.

05:44.427 --> 05:45.887
Oh, look at him.

05:45.970 --> 05:49.349
He swears everyone
is dying to work with him.

05:49.849 --> 05:51.142
I said I'd think about it.

05:56.689 --> 05:58.024
I have a huge problem.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.236
What is it?

06:02.737 --> 06:04.739
Do you remember the woman I met on that…

06:05.239 --> 06:08.117
dating website? The one you got me into.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.244
Of course. Tere, right?

06:11.329 --> 06:14.165
She's Regina's biological grandmother.

06:15.917 --> 06:17.001
No way, how?

06:17.085 --> 06:20.338
And Ana just brought
her daughter to my house, Mariana.

06:20.421 --> 06:22.298
She's breastfeeding Valentina.

06:22.882 --> 06:25.468
So, did she bring Tere to your house too?

06:25.551 --> 06:28.596
No, but I thought
we'd lose all contact with them.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.723
Well, kick them out.

06:30.807 --> 06:32.058
I can't.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.269
It would be like kicking Regina out.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.731
Why did I agree to join that website?

06:38.815 --> 06:39.857
I'm screwed.

06:42.777 --> 06:44.570
We don't even know those people.

06:45.363 --> 06:47.365
You're leaving because you're still mad?

06:47.448 --> 06:51.619
No, but I'll be better with them
than here with you, the enemy.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.665
Come with me and your granny to Tepoztlán.

06:55.748 --> 06:58.000
I told you, I don't want
to be far from Valentina.

06:59.627 --> 07:01.712
I'm staying at Ana's house for now.

07:01.796 --> 07:02.713
Ana?

07:02.797 --> 07:05.675
Oh, the witch has a name now?
Are you friends now?

07:06.175 --> 07:09.345
Look, I know this isn't ideal.
It's what's best for everyone.

07:10.179 --> 07:12.056
How long will you stay there?

07:12.140 --> 07:14.058
I don't know. We haven't settled that.

07:14.142 --> 07:16.602
-I have to go, it's time to feed the girl.
-Wait.

07:17.103 --> 07:19.480
Please, what you're doing is insane.

07:21.732 --> 07:23.693
At least come help me move, okay?

07:25.820 --> 07:26.946
Sure, let me know.

07:28.906 --> 07:30.366
Enough, Mom!

07:35.204 --> 07:36.956
What are you up to?

07:39.625 --> 07:40.585
Me?

07:40.668 --> 07:42.420
Don't play the fool, Manolo.

07:43.004 --> 07:44.755
You want to steal my client.

07:44.839 --> 07:47.091
Weren't you taking a year off?

07:47.175 --> 07:48.676
But I'm back now.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.803
And I thought you missed me.

07:51.804 --> 07:53.931
-You love to play dumb, huh?
-Wow.

07:55.850 --> 07:59.562
Yumiko was quite worried.
She told me the other day you had a…

08:01.689 --> 08:02.523
No.

08:03.024 --> 08:05.318
Yumiko loves committing Hara-kiri.

08:06.569 --> 08:07.528
I'll talk to her.

08:07.612 --> 08:09.113
-But do me a favor.
-Sure.

08:09.906 --> 08:11.991
Leave Cynthia alone, okay?

08:12.074 --> 08:12.950
Thank you.

08:13.910 --> 08:15.953
Hey, here's a thought.

08:17.038 --> 08:19.874
Let's flip a coin
and see who gets to keep her.

08:20.374 --> 08:22.335
No, no, she's not a thing.

08:22.418 --> 08:25.505
Then, we should ask her
who she wants to work with.

08:27.757 --> 08:28.633
You're on.

08:29.592 --> 08:32.220
But don't say I didn't warn you.

08:32.303 --> 08:33.638
Thanks for the warning.

08:33.721 --> 08:35.681
You'll be disappointed.

08:42.855 --> 08:45.149
I forgot to tell you,
you look beautiful today.

08:45.233 --> 08:48.319
Your hair looks amazing, and that blouse…

08:49.111 --> 08:50.112
divine.

08:55.576 --> 08:58.246
Success depends on strategy, okay?

08:58.329 --> 08:59.747
So, let's begin

08:59.830 --> 09:04.043
by weaning Valentina at her midnight meal,

09:04.126 --> 09:07.922
by introducing her
to the bottle with breast milk.

09:08.005 --> 09:10.174
Alta will feed her that bottle.

09:10.258 --> 09:11.926
-Me?
-Yes.

09:12.009 --> 09:15.805
This way, Valentina
will learn to feed from a bottle.

09:15.888 --> 09:19.642
And then, we'll replace
the breast milk with formula.

09:19.725 --> 09:21.644
How long will this take?

09:22.562 --> 09:25.314
-A week, tops.
-No, that can't be.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.441
It's best to do it gradually.

09:27.525 --> 09:29.360
I've been doing a lot of research

09:29.443 --> 09:32.530
for the app I'm developing.
I still don't know if--

09:32.613 --> 09:35.616
Listen, the app thing sounds great, but…

09:35.700 --> 09:38.869
here, the only one
who's had two other children is me,

09:38.953 --> 09:40.955
and they're not traumatized.

09:43.207 --> 09:46.085
You stopped breastfeeding them
after one week?

09:46.168 --> 09:47.795
She never breastfed them.

09:47.878 --> 09:49.422
I had no milk.

09:49.505 --> 09:51.507
She went back to work after two weeks.

09:52.675 --> 09:55.720
Mom, you've killed my desire
to ever see boobies.

09:55.803 --> 09:59.849
Am I missing Mario Bautista's
live stream for this?

09:59.932 --> 10:01.100
Now I get it.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.185
Go get comfort from Mario Bautista.

10:03.269 --> 10:06.647
I'll see what I can do
with my trauma-induced boob obsession.

10:06.731 --> 10:09.650
Oh, don't overdo it.
Besides, that's why you go to therapy.

10:10.484 --> 10:12.028
Here are some earplugs,

10:12.111 --> 10:14.322
in case you need them at night.

10:21.287 --> 10:22.330
Understood?

10:39.639 --> 10:40.640
Oh, please!

10:42.725 --> 10:43.768
Honey…

10:44.393 --> 10:45.353
hear that?

10:47.355 --> 10:48.314
Hear that?

10:48.397 --> 10:49.273
What?

10:49.357 --> 10:51.442
Shouldn't we go see Valentina?

10:52.902 --> 10:54.528
No, honey.

10:56.113 --> 10:59.659
Listen, it kills me to hear her cry too.

11:00.159 --> 11:02.995
We have to stay firm.
It's part of the plan.

11:03.079 --> 11:04.747
What if something happened to her?

11:06.582 --> 11:08.125
She's fine.

11:08.209 --> 11:09.710
She's with Altagracia.

11:11.253 --> 11:14.632
She'll stop crying in 20 minutes, tops.

11:18.010 --> 11:19.804
She stopped crying, you see?

11:20.846 --> 11:22.223
Go to sleep, come on.

11:26.268 --> 11:28.979
I'll go check if she's okay…

11:44.787 --> 11:46.706
Didn't I tell you I sleepwalk?

11:46.789 --> 11:48.416
Do you also breastfeed asleep?

11:48.499 --> 11:50.668
Must be the maternal subconscious.

11:51.794 --> 11:53.629
-Can I take her to my room?
-No.

11:53.713 --> 11:54.630
-Please.
-No.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.674
Just until she falls asleep.

11:56.757 --> 11:58.718
Or else, she'll cry and wake Regina,

11:58.801 --> 12:01.887
then she'll wake Altagracia,
and we'll have a bigger problem.

12:04.473 --> 12:06.058
Okay, but just for today.

12:06.892 --> 12:09.687
-And you'll put her back before Ana is up.
-Yes.

12:18.154 --> 12:20.406
Oh, I slept like a baby.

12:21.073 --> 12:24.535
The plan worked better than I anticipated.

12:24.618 --> 12:27.580
And this baby girl was so good.

12:27.663 --> 12:28.664
My Vale, look.

12:28.748 --> 12:32.209
Do you like this unicorn?
It was Regina's, but you can keep it.

12:33.335 --> 12:35.254
What's with you? With your face?

12:35.337 --> 12:37.006
Did you have a rough night?

12:38.632 --> 12:42.178
Regina, on the other hand, 
slept through the night.

12:42.261 --> 12:45.222
I had to pump milk out
halfway through the night.

12:45.306 --> 12:47.349
My boobies were exploding.

12:48.017 --> 12:49.852
Can we speak of something else?

12:50.436 --> 12:54.064
It wouldn't hurt
to put a bra on once in a while, either.

12:54.982 --> 12:57.610
-You'll make the teenager have a stroke.
-Ceci.

12:58.444 --> 13:02.072
We'll do the same today, okay?
So Valentina gets used to it.

13:02.156 --> 13:03.699
Constancy is important.

13:04.366 --> 13:05.826
I'll go to the office.

13:06.619 --> 13:09.163
Before Manolo steals my assistant from me.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.708
It turns out Cynthia will choose
who she wants as her boss.

13:13.375 --> 13:14.835
Manolo is a jerk.

13:16.003 --> 13:19.840
-Hopefully, Cynthia can see that.
-I'd stay with whoever was nicer to me.

13:22.218 --> 13:23.677
Traffic was awful.

13:23.761 --> 13:27.306
Besides, I detoured to the coffee place
we like and brought you one.

13:28.599 --> 13:30.684
-I can't have coffee.
-No, Ana.

13:30.768 --> 13:33.604
Cynthia has gastritis.
I'm sure it's stress.

13:34.230 --> 13:36.690
I brought you
the organic lavender tea you like.

13:36.774 --> 13:37.900
Thanks.

13:38.943 --> 13:39.985
Both of you.

13:40.611 --> 13:41.529
You're welcome.

13:46.450 --> 13:48.160
No, I can't do it all alone.

13:48.244 --> 13:49.453
Yes, okay, I'm coming.

13:49.537 --> 13:51.080
How many boxes do you need?

13:51.163 --> 13:52.581
I don't know, a few.

13:52.665 --> 13:53.666
Many.

13:53.749 --> 13:56.210
Okay, do you still have a lot to pack?

13:56.293 --> 13:59.463
Kind of a lot.

13:59.547 --> 14:01.924
Mom, can't you answer one question?

14:02.007 --> 14:03.843
Hey, enough with the attitude!

14:03.926 --> 14:06.720
I'll find a way to get the boxes,
and drop by tomorrow.

14:06.804 --> 14:08.305
I'll take a cab, okay?

14:08.806 --> 14:09.640
Okay.

14:12.351 --> 14:13.727
Is your mom moving?

14:13.811 --> 14:15.020
Yes, to Tepoz.

14:15.104 --> 14:15.980
Why is that?

14:16.063 --> 14:19.775
-We can't afford the rent anymore.
-I could lend you some cash.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.819
It's okay, she'll live with my granny.

14:21.902 --> 14:25.239
After leaving this place,
I might go there too. We're not sure yet.

14:25.322 --> 14:27.992
Ramón can look for the boxes
and take you there tomorrow.

14:28.075 --> 14:29.618
I don't want to be a burden.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.537
It's no problem, I'll tell him.

14:32.037 --> 14:33.664
-Okay, thanks.
-You're welcome.

14:33.747 --> 14:34.790
Bye.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.792
Bye. Goodbye.

14:36.876 --> 14:37.835
Bye-bye.

14:37.918 --> 14:39.503
You can help her and pay her rent.

14:39.587 --> 14:41.839
No way. What if Ana found out?

14:41.922 --> 14:44.466
Find out her account
and transfer her the money.

14:44.550 --> 14:46.510
Of course not. No way.

14:47.177 --> 14:49.388
I don't know why I joined that website.

14:49.471 --> 14:52.808
I do. You were this close to saying,
"To hell with Ana." That's why.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.144
And don't complain, you loved it.

14:55.227 --> 14:56.729
I've never seen you so happy.

14:56.812 --> 14:59.356
Okay, yes. It was good. Really good.

15:00.232 --> 15:01.358
But it's over now.

15:04.111 --> 15:06.697
I just want to help her,
for Regina's sake.

15:07.281 --> 15:09.199
Well, transfer her the money.

15:09.283 --> 15:10.492
I'll get it!

15:11.577 --> 15:12.494
Hello!

15:12.578 --> 15:14.330
What's up, dude? Where were you?

15:20.127 --> 15:22.546
-I missed you so much.
-And I missed you.

15:22.630 --> 15:25.215
This is no time for company,
my bosses aren't here.

15:25.299 --> 15:27.092
Alta, don't worry.

15:28.469 --> 15:31.138
Elena is practically family. Come.

15:31.221 --> 15:34.391
Let's go upstairs so you see the babies,
they're with the nanny.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.520
You're kidding! You have a nanny?

15:38.604 --> 15:40.898
She's not my nanny. Whatever, dude.

15:42.066 --> 15:44.985
I can't intrude in someone's life
without their consent.

15:45.069 --> 15:45.986
No, you can't.

15:48.530 --> 15:51.367
What if she has a boyfriend?
Or maybe she's married.

15:51.450 --> 15:53.535
Well, then talk to her,

15:53.619 --> 15:56.038
or play, but do something, man.

15:58.332 --> 16:00.751
Yes, thanks, but no thanks.

16:01.335 --> 16:03.128
Mariana has a place to come back to.

16:03.212 --> 16:05.422
Yes, she mentioned it, but I thought--

16:05.506 --> 16:07.383
I truly appreciate it, Juan Carlos.

16:07.466 --> 16:10.386
If she found out about us
and that I accepted your money,

16:10.469 --> 16:12.429
she'd never forgive me. You know?

16:13.013 --> 16:16.308
-She doesn't need to find out.
-I know, but what if she does?

16:16.392 --> 16:18.686
I don't want to take that risk.
So, forget it.

16:18.769 --> 16:20.813
I mean it, I really appreciate it.

16:20.896 --> 16:23.732
Sorry to hang up,
but I have to get back to work.

16:26.443 --> 16:27.403
What did he say?

16:28.028 --> 16:31.031
He wants to give me money
so I can stay at the apartment.

16:31.532 --> 16:34.201
If I was sure Mariana
would come back there,

16:34.743 --> 16:36.036
I'd accept his offer.

16:38.330 --> 16:39.999
Something awesome occurred to me.

16:40.082 --> 16:43.836
I'll write down everything I observe
from Valentina and Regina for my app.

16:43.919 --> 16:47.381
I want to see the difference
between a baby fed only with formula

16:47.464 --> 16:49.258
and a baby fed with breast milk.

16:49.341 --> 16:52.386
What's more,
this could be my thesis project

16:52.469 --> 16:54.096
when I go back to college.

16:54.722 --> 16:57.725
And what will you do
when Vale stops breastfeeding?

16:58.350 --> 17:00.561
I don't know. I don't want to go to Tepoz.

17:02.312 --> 17:03.147
Why don't you…

17:04.023 --> 17:05.441
come live with me?

17:05.941 --> 17:07.443
With your whole family?

17:07.943 --> 17:09.570
The more the merrier, right?

17:11.071 --> 17:13.073
I don't even know how I got here.

17:13.657 --> 17:17.411
I was very angry at my mom
and really missed Valentina.

17:18.203 --> 17:20.247
After this, I don't know what I'll do.

17:22.166 --> 17:23.625
You're not alone, okay?

17:40.434 --> 17:41.310
Cynthia.

17:42.186 --> 17:43.812
I need to get back home.

17:44.396 --> 17:46.190
I'll send you our pending duties.

17:46.273 --> 17:50.319
I meant to leave early.
Manolo got me some concert tickets.

17:50.402 --> 17:52.780
I don't care
what Manolo thinks, says or does.

17:52.863 --> 17:54.448
I need you to stay here.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.744
Your picnic is over, princesses.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.623
Chigüis, pick Regina up, will you?

18:04.708 --> 18:07.086
What's wrong?
We're just catching some sun.

18:07.169 --> 18:08.754
It's good for the babies.

18:08.837 --> 18:11.006
Yes, on weekends, in Valle.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.801
On weekdays in the city,
no one ever sunbathes.

18:15.427 --> 18:18.347
I thought Juan Carlos
told you the house rules.

18:18.430 --> 18:19.973
Yes, he told me some.

18:20.599 --> 18:22.601
He didn't tell you
about Regina's allergies?

18:22.684 --> 18:24.103
Grass makes her ill.

18:24.186 --> 18:26.188
Oh, sorry, we didn't know.

18:26.730 --> 18:27.981
And who are you?

18:28.065 --> 18:29.483
-A friend.
-Her girlfriend.

18:31.610 --> 18:35.280
Okay, while you get your stories straight,
another house rule

18:35.364 --> 18:37.908
is no one can come in
unless they've been invited.

18:38.534 --> 18:40.410
Imagine me coming home

18:40.494 --> 18:42.871
to find a stranger full of tattoos.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.835
I like tattoos, Mom.

18:52.422 --> 18:53.465
Ro!

18:54.133 --> 18:55.342
I don't like them, Mom.

18:57.427 --> 18:58.595
Give me your cellphone.

18:58.679 --> 19:00.222
-Why?
-Give it.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.061
No… those pictures are mine.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.312
They were, sweetie.

19:09.565 --> 19:11.650
There are rules to follow here…

19:11.733 --> 19:14.278
and we must all obey them.

19:14.361 --> 19:17.656
Okay, why don't you send me
the rules so I know them?

19:17.739 --> 19:19.950
I'll send them to you, of course.

19:21.118 --> 19:22.369
Cover yourselves.

19:25.372 --> 19:28.500
-Now she'll be in a bad mood.
-For a week, at least.

19:29.209 --> 19:30.085
Because of you.

19:30.794 --> 19:31.712
Thanks.

19:31.795 --> 19:33.297
They're really cool.

19:34.256 --> 19:36.258
Kids, come on!

19:41.388 --> 19:42.306
Your friend?

19:45.809 --> 19:48.145
HOUSE RULES

19:49.855 --> 19:51.899
Ceci told me about the whole mess.

19:52.733 --> 19:53.609
Yes.

19:54.234 --> 19:56.862
Thanks to Mariana,
I had to leave the office

19:56.945 --> 19:58.530
and now Cynthia will hate me.

19:59.698 --> 20:02.117
Now, I'm writing the rules for her,

20:02.201 --> 20:04.620
because no one
helped me tell them to her.

20:04.703 --> 20:07.289
There are so many, I must've missed some.

20:24.973 --> 20:26.767
Do you know all the rules?

20:27.476 --> 20:29.144
For example, this one:

20:29.228 --> 20:33.106
"You can't be barefoot around the house 
without cleaning your feet first."

20:33.190 --> 20:35.317
Aren't you supposed
to clean them afterwards?

20:35.400 --> 20:37.319
It depends on the feet, I guess.

20:38.195 --> 20:39.738
Where do I put this?

20:39.821 --> 20:41.531
There, thank you.

20:42.324 --> 20:44.368
-Mom!
-I'm here!

20:49.539 --> 20:52.042
What happened? Nothing's packed.

20:52.125 --> 20:55.963
I only have two hours before
I have to get back to feed Valentina.

20:56.046 --> 20:59.383
I hurt my left foot and it really hurts.

20:59.466 --> 21:01.551
-Let me see.
-You should come to Tepoztlán.

21:02.594 --> 21:04.721
-I can't do this alone.
-Mom, that's your right.

21:04.805 --> 21:05.931
Oh, sorry.

21:07.015 --> 21:08.600
You didn't get hurt, did you?

21:12.229 --> 21:14.648
I never know
which one's right and which one's left!

21:14.731 --> 21:16.942
Unbelievable, it's always the same.

21:17.025 --> 21:19.820
-I'm sick of your lies and guilt trips.
-No, Mariana.

21:19.903 --> 21:21.738
No, really, please. Mariana!

21:21.822 --> 21:24.199
Come with me to Tepoztlán,
you're my family.

21:24.283 --> 21:25.742
I can help you take care of her.

21:25.826 --> 21:28.537
Mom, I don't want your help,
I can do it on my own.

21:29.162 --> 21:30.747
Oh, "I can do it on my own."

21:31.790 --> 21:34.793
I said the same thing
to your granny when you were born.

21:34.876 --> 21:38.380
I'm terrified you'll make
the same mistakes and regret this.

21:38.463 --> 21:40.799
I don't know if living
with Ana is a mistake or not.

21:40.882 --> 21:43.176
What I do know
is I want to be close to Valentina.

21:43.260 --> 21:44.678
Well, then…

21:45.220 --> 21:47.681
let me figure out a way to stay here.

21:47.764 --> 21:50.809
-You'd still be close to the baby--
-Mom, we can't afford rent.

21:50.892 --> 21:55.147
-Let me know when you're ready to move.
-No, Mariana. Please, girl.

21:55.230 --> 21:57.816
Oh, I'm begging. Look!

21:57.899 --> 22:01.194
Good morning, gorgeous.
You look great today.

22:01.278 --> 22:04.239
Manolo, you don't have to tell me
how good I look every day.

22:04.823 --> 22:05.699
Okay.

22:06.700 --> 22:10.579
I heard you didn't let Cyn go
to Il Divo's concert.

22:12.664 --> 22:13.582
Il Divo?

22:14.333 --> 22:16.710
Oh no, I'm glad she didn't go, then.

22:16.793 --> 22:18.045
I did her a favor.

22:18.587 --> 22:20.714
Who likes Il Divo?

22:27.012 --> 22:28.555
It was her birthday gift.

22:31.350 --> 22:32.851
You obviously know it's today.

22:35.145 --> 22:36.146
Good day.

22:40.817 --> 22:41.902
Hey.

22:44.279 --> 22:46.156
Sorry about what happened with your mom.

22:46.239 --> 22:48.784
I didn't want to get you
or Rodrigo in trouble.

22:49.284 --> 22:50.660
No, it's cool.

22:51.244 --> 22:52.120
And Regina?

22:52.204 --> 22:53.622
She's napping.

22:54.581 --> 22:55.415
Look.

22:57.000 --> 22:57.834
What's that?

22:58.418 --> 23:00.087
You want to get a tattoo?

23:00.170 --> 23:03.048
I'd love to, but my mom would kill me.

23:05.342 --> 23:07.969
Unless… you help me.

23:09.179 --> 23:11.056
She didn't exactly say no.

23:12.641 --> 23:16.186
I guess if I keep the apartment,
Mariana would come back to live with me.

23:16.269 --> 23:19.981
There you go.
Don't be stupid, take Juan Carlos' money.

23:21.358 --> 23:22.275
If I were you…

23:23.902 --> 23:24.820
I'd ask for more.

23:25.529 --> 23:28.031
For the business we always wanted to open.

23:28.782 --> 23:31.034
Oh, no way, Lorena.
That would be too much.

23:31.118 --> 23:33.161
How will you pay rent
the rest of the year?

23:34.162 --> 23:35.205
You're right.

23:36.498 --> 23:38.750
Well, if I accept…

23:38.834 --> 23:40.585
it would be as a loan.

23:41.211 --> 23:43.130
Okay? And I don't have to see him.

23:43.213 --> 23:45.048
-No.
-He can just transfer the money.

23:45.132 --> 23:46.466
Yes… as simple as that.

23:48.635 --> 23:49.719
Yes?

23:50.345 --> 23:52.180
-I'll send him an e-mail.
-Great.

23:52.264 --> 23:53.098
-Yeah.
-Do it.

23:53.181 --> 23:54.182
You're on.

23:55.308 --> 23:58.311
Tere accepted the money,
but she doesn't want to see me.

23:58.395 --> 23:59.479
Perfect, right?

23:59.563 --> 24:01.565
Mariana will have a place to go back to.

24:01.648 --> 24:03.567
She asked for cash to start a business.

24:03.650 --> 24:04.985
I'll be damned!

24:05.485 --> 24:07.154
That Tere sure is smart, huh?

24:08.780 --> 24:11.616
Look… all I want
is for this to be easy for Regina.

24:12.617 --> 24:14.411
Bro, you have no choice.

24:15.162 --> 24:17.456
Give her the money… that's that.

24:18.039 --> 24:19.332
No one will find out.

24:19.416 --> 24:21.376
It looks great on you.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.295
It's amazing. Let's see…

24:24.504 --> 24:26.673
You can't see it with my hair down.

24:27.215 --> 24:28.884
Why are you spying, you snitch?

24:28.967 --> 24:31.470
Didn't you just get scolded
for being here?

24:31.553 --> 24:32.512
Oh…

24:33.096 --> 24:36.600
What are you gonna do?
Will you snitch? Is that it?

24:37.350 --> 24:39.769
What you don't know
is that I'm at a crossroads.

24:40.437 --> 24:42.397
Ceci got here first,
she took my dad's side.

24:42.481 --> 24:45.442
I had no choice but to be on Mom's side.

24:45.525 --> 24:47.277
Otherwise, she'd be on her own.

24:47.360 --> 24:49.488
Don't tell Mom, Rodrigo.

24:49.571 --> 24:51.198
Hey, let's do this…

24:51.823 --> 24:53.533
If you don't say a word…

24:54.242 --> 24:55.619
I'll show you.

24:56.495 --> 24:57.954
What will you show me?

24:58.038 --> 24:59.414
My boobs.

24:59.498 --> 25:00.332
Okay.

25:01.082 --> 25:02.876
-Can I take a picture?
-It's a deal.

25:02.959 --> 25:04.753
-Elena!
-Oh, dude!

25:05.670 --> 25:08.381
Elena, come on, he's just a kid.

25:08.465 --> 25:11.092
Don't be fooled by his braces,

25:11.176 --> 25:13.303
he's seen worse online, I'm sure.

25:13.386 --> 25:16.264
His mom checks his phone,
I'll get in trouble.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.266
Dude, he has a mustache, look at him.

25:23.563 --> 25:24.856
This is too much.

25:26.274 --> 25:27.817
Are you really angry at me?

25:28.318 --> 25:29.903
I was defending you, Mariana.

25:29.986 --> 25:32.030
I don't need you to defend me.

25:32.113 --> 25:34.366
Don't fight with your girlfriend
over me, Mariana.

25:34.449 --> 25:35.659
She's not my girlfriend.

25:39.913 --> 25:42.457
Wow, we've been dating for six months.

25:43.041 --> 25:45.502
I have a baby, I can't have a girlfriend.

25:46.711 --> 25:48.838
You're right, I don't know why I'm here.

25:48.922 --> 25:51.841
-No, no, sorry.
-No, you're right.

25:53.009 --> 25:54.594
Let's take a break, okay?

25:57.639 --> 26:00.392
Oh, I'm so stupid!

26:01.101 --> 26:03.478
You did friend-zone her big time.

26:03.562 --> 26:04.604
Cynthia?

26:05.188 --> 26:06.106
Did you call me?

26:06.690 --> 26:08.483
Yes, call Enrique Olvera

26:08.567 --> 26:11.069
and book a table for two at Pujol tonight.

26:11.152 --> 26:12.862
Are you celebrating something?

26:12.946 --> 26:15.490
Yes, your birthday!

26:15.574 --> 26:17.158
Congratulations!

26:18.076 --> 26:21.371
That would have to be months from now.
My birthday is in December.

26:23.582 --> 26:24.833
It's on my Facebook.

26:27.627 --> 26:30.422
Well… hurry up and call.

26:30.505 --> 26:34.551
You know
how hard it is to get a table there.

26:34.634 --> 26:36.052
Yes, okay.

26:36.553 --> 26:37.470
Thank you.

26:40.974 --> 26:44.311
Though… tomorrow
is my saint's day, if it helps.

26:45.186 --> 26:46.938
And I love unicorns.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.363
He tricked me and it's all your fault.

26:55.989 --> 26:58.742
I was ridiculed
for trying to be nice to Cynthia.

26:58.825 --> 27:01.828
Now I have to buy her a unicorn
for her saint's day.

27:02.579 --> 27:03.747
Hey?

27:03.830 --> 27:05.957
Why don't you give her this one?

27:06.041 --> 27:08.376
Neither of them really liked it.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.712
But you bought that for Regina.

27:10.795 --> 27:12.547
Don't worry, it's okay.

27:12.631 --> 27:13.465
Really?

27:14.633 --> 27:15.675
Oh, well, thanks.

27:21.306 --> 27:23.516
Are you expecting a business call?

27:24.476 --> 27:25.310
No.

27:25.810 --> 27:27.562
Elena won't pick up.

27:28.063 --> 27:30.065
She's pissed
I said she wasn't my girlfriend.

27:30.148 --> 27:31.024
Obviously.

27:32.692 --> 27:35.445
It hurts when you're
more in love than the other person.

27:38.948 --> 27:40.492
Just give her some space.

27:46.498 --> 27:47.540
Oh, baby.

27:58.760 --> 28:01.638
Good morning, my love.

28:05.850 --> 28:07.727
Alta… Alta!

28:10.021 --> 28:11.106
Where's Valentina?

28:11.189 --> 28:12.107
Valentina?

28:13.650 --> 28:15.694
Oh, Valentina.

28:19.906 --> 28:22.534
Have you been breastfeeding
Valentina at night?

28:22.617 --> 28:23.576
Sorry.

28:23.660 --> 28:25.495
I hate seeing her cry.

28:26.121 --> 28:29.708
Mariana, the weaning plan won't work.

28:29.791 --> 28:31.084
What's going on?

28:31.167 --> 28:33.628
She's been breastfeeding
Valentina at night.

28:34.462 --> 28:36.381
We all agreed to the plan.

28:36.464 --> 28:37.924
Well, everyone but me.

28:38.007 --> 28:41.803
Yes, because you've insisted
on breaking my house rules.

28:41.886 --> 28:43.972
Why are you screaming this early?

28:44.055 --> 28:48.059
Ana, the truth is, your entire family
is a bit tired of all your rules.

28:48.143 --> 28:49.519
That's what you think.

28:49.602 --> 28:51.980
If it's not a baby crying,
it's someone screaming.

28:52.063 --> 28:53.189
What's going on?

28:53.273 --> 28:57.444
Ana, I knew Mariana
was taking Valentina every night.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.656
And I have a tattoo on my neck now.

29:01.740 --> 29:04.033
I have a picture
of boobs on my cellphone.

29:04.701 --> 29:05.827
Oh, my God.

29:07.203 --> 29:08.037
What is this?

29:09.581 --> 29:10.665
A coup.

29:10.749 --> 29:12.333
The tattoo is temporary.

29:12.917 --> 29:16.588
I still don't get why
she can't get a permanent one, though.

29:16.671 --> 29:19.966
-It's harmless.
-Because I don't want her to. No, because…

29:23.970 --> 29:24.929
Because of this.

29:26.931 --> 29:27.932
See this?

29:29.350 --> 29:31.770
I had an ex's name tattooed here.

29:32.979 --> 29:35.523
Daniel's? You said you never loved him.

29:35.607 --> 29:39.319
-I thought you had your appendix removed.
-I knew that wasn't the right spot.

29:40.153 --> 29:42.113
Would you get dad's name tattooed?

29:44.908 --> 29:46.034
That's not the point.

29:48.119 --> 29:48.953
Let's see.

29:50.580 --> 29:54.250
All I want is for my kids
not to make the mistakes I did

29:54.334 --> 29:55.710
and regret them later.

30:11.100 --> 30:12.435
What are you watching?

30:12.936 --> 30:14.437
Oh, hello.

30:15.313 --> 30:16.523
A video of you.

30:18.024 --> 30:19.901
From when you turned five.

30:26.324 --> 30:27.659
I miss you, darling.

30:28.952 --> 30:30.161
And I miss you, Mom.

30:32.038 --> 30:33.873
Hey, guess what?

30:33.957 --> 30:36.209
I got money to pay the rent.

30:37.085 --> 30:41.047
We won't have to live with Granny
in Tepoztlán. You can come home.

30:44.467 --> 30:47.220
I'm happy
you won't have to leave this place.

30:49.222 --> 30:53.768
To be honest, I'll stay in Ana's house
until I can wean Valentina.

30:57.647 --> 31:00.817
I know you don't want me
to make the same mistakes you made.

31:01.651 --> 31:03.903
But you'll have to let me live my life

31:03.987 --> 31:05.864
and learn my own lessons.

31:06.823 --> 31:09.742
Just like I'll let Regina live hers.

31:09.826 --> 31:11.619
Even though I'm terrified.

31:14.581 --> 31:15.665
Well, yes.

31:18.751 --> 31:20.879
Look how beautiful you were.

31:22.964 --> 31:24.215
So cute.

31:26.342 --> 31:27.218
So pretty.

31:29.596 --> 31:30.471
No, no.

31:38.021 --> 31:41.065
It's not new,
but Valentina is too little for it.

31:43.985 --> 31:44.986
Thank you.

31:45.069 --> 31:48.323
And the products in customs
were released. So, Yumiko…

31:48.781 --> 31:49.991
will stop suffering.

31:58.291 --> 32:01.169
It's ridiculous, Cynthia,
I can't control everything.

32:02.712 --> 32:04.923
If you want to work with Manolo, go ahead.

32:05.006 --> 32:09.177
But I don't want to work with him.
I really like working with you.

32:12.138 --> 32:14.098
I wanted to see how far you'd go.

32:17.477 --> 32:18.478
I really admire you.

32:18.978 --> 32:21.105
Someday, I wish to be like you.

32:24.150 --> 32:25.151
Well, thank you.

32:26.569 --> 32:27.570
The truth is…

32:28.363 --> 32:30.448
sometimes even I don't like the way I am.

32:34.827 --> 32:38.039
But you can never tell anyone, ever.

32:49.217 --> 32:50.093
Hey…

32:52.971 --> 32:55.556
Sorry for ratting you all out.

32:57.475 --> 32:59.727
No beer for you, you're breastfeeding.

33:00.436 --> 33:03.481
No, beer is good for milk production.

33:03.564 --> 33:05.108
I looked it up for my app.

33:06.567 --> 33:08.069
How was the move?

33:08.152 --> 33:09.445
We're not moving anymore.

33:09.529 --> 33:11.197
My mom got the money.

33:11.280 --> 33:12.407
I don't know how, but…

33:12.490 --> 33:14.993
I hope she can pay back what she owes.

33:16.285 --> 33:17.996
Will you go back to her?

33:18.621 --> 33:20.999
Not until Valentina
doesn't need me anymore.

33:21.958 --> 33:22.875
Hey…

33:23.543 --> 33:26.963
I can't go on being your accomplice
when you take her at night.

33:27.046 --> 33:28.506
I never should've done it.

33:29.465 --> 33:32.218
I know.
I know. I understand, I really do.

33:32.301 --> 33:34.929
Sorry for making you brake Ana's rules.

33:35.013 --> 33:36.389
Don't judge her.

33:37.056 --> 33:40.309
Control is Ana's way
of showing us her love.

33:41.477 --> 33:43.312
That's more than enough for me.

33:48.443 --> 33:51.112
FINANCE FOR MARKETING AND SALES

33:53.364 --> 33:54.240
What's that?

33:56.075 --> 33:58.578
You haven't worn that
since we had Rodrigo.

34:05.626 --> 34:06.502
Do you like it?

34:25.646 --> 34:27.732
If you didn't work so much…

34:29.400 --> 34:30.985
And if you supported me…

34:32.070 --> 34:34.072
You can't say I don't support you.

34:34.989 --> 34:36.908
Settling isn't supporting me.

34:37.492 --> 34:40.578
You don't know what it's like
being a woman in a man's world.

34:41.871 --> 34:43.873
I was about to lose my client

34:43.956 --> 34:47.919
and my assistant for daring
to stay home a few months with my baby.

34:48.503 --> 34:52.090
And all you care about
is what a fucking tattoo says.

35:03.101 --> 35:05.144
Did your "friend" answer your calls?

35:05.770 --> 35:06.813
No.

35:06.896 --> 35:11.192
But I texted her saying
we should give each other some space.

35:21.702 --> 35:23.162
I can't sleep.

35:24.122 --> 35:25.331
Me neither.

35:26.165 --> 35:28.459
I don't want to hear Valentina cry.

35:31.504 --> 35:33.339
I'll stick to the weaning plan.

35:36.008 --> 35:38.427
And sorry for breaking your house rules.

35:41.305 --> 35:44.016
Maybe it's time
to take some rules off the list.

35:45.268 --> 35:47.562
Some sun will certainly do the girls good.

35:50.481 --> 35:53.526
This mom thing isn't that easy, right?

35:54.443 --> 35:56.863
No… definitely not.

35:57.446 --> 35:59.949
-You need lots of improvising.
-Discipline.

36:03.619 --> 36:05.121
Look…

36:05.204 --> 36:07.790
I don't know where this will lead us, but…

36:08.457 --> 36:11.586
let's make it work for the girls, okay?

36:13.171 --> 36:14.130
Okay.

36:14.797 --> 36:17.758
Ma'am! Someone's at the door for Mariana.

36:19.177 --> 36:20.636
At 2:00 a.m.?

36:27.143 --> 36:28.978
-Who are they?
-Good evening.

36:29.061 --> 36:32.273
I'm Regina's father and this…

36:32.940 --> 36:33.900
is my lawyer.

36:34.609 --> 36:35.860
I'm suing you.

37:53.646 --> 37:57.275
