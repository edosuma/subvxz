Cheers <i>is filmed before a live</i> 
     <i>studio audience.</i>

00:04.336 --> 00:07.505
Excuse me, can I have           
your attention please?

00:07.540 --> 00:10.442
It is my pleasure,              
once again,

00:10.476 --> 00:13.311
to present the Cheers Employee  
of the Month Award.

00:13.345 --> 00:16.414
And I am delighted to present it
  to our very own, Sam Malone.

00:16.449 --> 00:17.349
Congratulations.    
Bravo!

00:17.383 --> 00:18.916
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:18.951 --> 00:21.219
I told you before   
        I don't want that thing.

00:21.254 --> 00:22.721
And don't put my picture    
    on the wall, either.

00:22.755 --> 00:23.755
I hate that stuff.

00:23.789 --> 00:26.057
Oh, great speech, Sammy.

00:26.091 --> 00:27.108
Fine.

00:27.142 --> 00:29.310
Carla, you haven't been
          offensive this month,

00:29.344 --> 00:29.978
why don't you take it?

00:30.012 --> 00:32.012
Get that thing                  
away from me.

00:32.046 --> 00:34.215
Woody?

00:34.249 --> 00:36.417
Congratulations, you're     
the Employee of the Month.

00:36.451 --> 00:41.673
Wow, four months in a row!

00:41.707 --> 00:44.476
I wasn't really expecting       
    this great honor.

00:44.510 --> 00:45.910
I'm deeply moved.

00:45.944 --> 00:49.097
You know, it takes more than one
person to win this award.

00:49.131 --> 00:50.966
It takes teamwork.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.533
I would like to thank my...

Hey, you know, same to ya!

02:07.876 --> 02:09.143
That's it, I've had it.

02:09.178 --> 02:11.646
I'm finished.

02:11.681 --> 02:13.398
I've been embarrassed   
            for the last time.  
                        What?

02:13.432 --> 02:14.365
I just came on                  
to Rebecca

02:14.400 --> 02:16.384
for the I-don't-know-           
how-manyth time.

02:16.418 --> 02:18.920
4,659.

02:18.954 --> 02:20.722
Thank you, Carla.

02:20.756 --> 02:22.974
And she shot me down once again.

02:23.008 --> 02:24.742
Well, you know, that's it.

02:24.777 --> 02:26.143
That's the last time            
I'm gonna do that.

02:26.178 --> 02:29.714
I'm gonna get my self respect  
    back starting right now.

02:29.748 --> 02:33.367
Whoo!              
Feels damn good, I'll tell you.

02:34.770 --> 02:36.037
You know, Sam, 
                 there's one way

02:36.072 --> 02:37.538
to get Rebecca that
             you've overlooked.

02:37.573 --> 02:39.574
Hold that self-respect thought.

02:39.608 --> 02:40.742
What do you got?

02:40.776 --> 02:42.710
You see, it's been
      psychologically documented

02:42.745 --> 02:47.515
that all human animals have
a neurotic hair-trigger response

02:47.550 --> 02:50.852
to at least one
    of the five sensory stimuli.

02:50.886 --> 02:52.954
It could be
             anything, actually.

02:52.988 --> 02:56.190
Oh, it's the sound of   
            the surf pounding   
              against the shore,

02:56.225 --> 02:59.961
the smell of honeysuckle
        on a warm summer night,

02:59.995 --> 03:02.797
the taste of a vintage
        Chateauneuf du Pape,

03:02.832 --> 03:08.586
fire-red fingernails dancing
     through your chest hair...

03:09.805 --> 03:16.927
a black lace teddy straining
     against its fleshy cargo.

03:16.962 --> 03:19.613
Frasier, man,                   
snap out of it.

03:19.648 --> 03:21.115
In a minute, Sam.

03:26.355 --> 03:28.789
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

03:28.823 --> 03:29.958
Some mornings

03:29.992 --> 03:31.676
you get up, you look at yourself
in the mirror

03:31.710 --> 03:33.577
and you've got to ask, "Why me?"

03:33.612 --> 03:34.879
Cliffie, it's just a haircut.

03:34.913 --> 03:36.181
It'll grow back.

03:37.349 --> 03:39.317
Nah, I'm over that, Normie.

03:39.351 --> 03:40.985
I got saddled with a job

03:41.019 --> 03:43.721
of breaking in         
     a new postal employee.

03:43.755 --> 03:45.122
Yeah, so I told the supervisor

03:45.157 --> 03:47.925
to send the greenhorn down here 
    and I could size him up.

03:47.959 --> 03:49.760
Boy, they made you              
a trainer, huh?

03:49.794 --> 03:52.730
Well, that sounds like a
        compliment to me, Cliff.

03:52.764 --> 03:56.117
You really are a civilian,      
aren't you, Sammy?

03:56.151 --> 03:57.785
It's a nightmare.

03:57.819 --> 03:59.620
Those rookies, yeah,            
they just get in your way,

03:59.654 --> 04:01.956
ask you stupid questions,       
  throw off your whole rhythm.

04:01.990 --> 04:04.542
Oh, God, this won't slow down  
    the mail, will it?

04:08.347 --> 04:10.331
Uh-oh, Cliff, greenhorn alert.

04:10.365 --> 04:12.233
Excuse me, Cliff Clavin?

04:12.267 --> 04:13.468
I am.

04:13.502 --> 04:15.870
I'm your trainee,               
Margaret O'Keefe.

04:15.905 --> 04:17.939
Straighten up, O'Keefe.
              You're in uniform.

04:24.880 --> 04:27.949
I wasn't informed               
you were a woman.

04:27.983 --> 04:29.818
Sorry, sir.

04:29.852 --> 04:31.519
Well, no offense, sister,

04:31.554 --> 04:33.822
but I just don't believe        
that women belong               
in the trenches.

04:33.856 --> 04:35.957
I mean, they're fine            
for sorting mail                
or selling stamps,

04:35.991 --> 04:38.460
but when you're lugging         
a 40-pound sack

04:38.494 --> 04:39.694
up a hill with a Nor'easter

04:39.728 --> 04:41.429
hitting you right smack         
in the kisser,

04:41.464 --> 04:43.364
you don't have time             
to fret about going home

04:43.398 --> 04:45.567
and soaking your delicates.

04:47.069 --> 04:49.036
I wear cotton   
                briefs, sir.

04:49.071 --> 04:50.705
That'll be enough of that,      
O'Keefe.

04:52.942 --> 04:55.109
Permission                      
to speak freely, sir?

04:55.143 --> 04:58.446
Permission granted.

04:58.481 --> 04:59.981
I requested you                 
as my trainer

05:00.015 --> 05:01.649
because I want                  
to learn hard

05:01.684 --> 05:03.317
and I want to learn right.

05:03.352 --> 05:04.802
I want to be            
        the best carrier

05:04.836 --> 05:07.571
in the department,              
next to you, of course.

05:07.606 --> 05:08.839
Because I love                  
the post office

05:08.874 --> 05:11.042
more than my life itself.

05:11.076 --> 05:14.762
Good grief, there's another one.

05:14.796 --> 05:16.914
The post office                 
is in my blood;

05:16.948 --> 05:20.451
my father was a carrier,        
and his father before him.

05:20.486 --> 05:21.719
It's been                       
a life-long dream of mine

05:21.753 --> 05:23.053
to wear the eagle               
on my sleeve

05:23.088 --> 05:26.023
and to be a part                
of the few, the proud...

05:26.057 --> 05:28.192
The undateable.

05:30.095 --> 05:32.196
Oh, your attitude

05:32.231 --> 05:33.598
is commendable 
                 there, O'Keefe.

05:33.632 --> 05:37.067
Look, I think   
                you better mosey
                     on home now

05:37.102 --> 05:38.802
and grab                        
some shuteye.

05:38.837 --> 05:41.939
You're going          
    to need plenty of sleep.

05:41.973 --> 05:44.775
Tomorrow is <i>TV Guide</i> day.

05:46.345 --> 05:48.679
I'll do you proud, sir.

05:48.713 --> 05:50.748
Yeah, we'll see about that.

05:53.918 --> 05:57.388
Is it my imagination, or was  
  that woman coming on to me?

05:59.057 --> 06:02.093
Cliffie, Walt Disney    
        should have had your    
            imagination.

06:03.929 --> 06:05.363
Say, hi, honey.

06:05.397 --> 06:07.164
Um, Fras and I                  
were just talking

06:07.199 --> 06:09.667
about how sorry                 
we feel about you.

06:09.702 --> 06:11.168
Why is that, Sam?

06:11.203 --> 06:13.705
Well, it's just that            
you're always stuck             
in your office,

06:13.739 --> 06:16.407
you know, worrying about losses 
and profits and career moves,

06:16.441 --> 06:17.542
while we're out here

06:17.576 --> 06:19.210
having fascinating,

06:19.244 --> 06:20.394
fun-filled conversations

06:20.429 --> 06:26.500
about things like, well,        
like sexual stimuluses.

06:28.203 --> 06:31.205
By the way, do you have,        
do you have one of those?

06:34.410 --> 06:36.311
Well, I am driven 
              to a sexual frenzy

06:36.345 --> 06:38.512
by people who mind 
             their own business.

06:38.547 --> 06:41.416
No, no, really, listen.

06:41.450 --> 06:42.850
You know,   
         it's not like I'm going

06:42.884 --> 06:44.552
to do anything with it
                    or anything.

06:44.586 --> 06:45.853
Okay, I'll be honest            
with you.

06:45.887 --> 06:49.090
I do have one                   
and I'll give you a hint.

06:49.124 --> 06:50.491
A hint?
                     Great, why?

06:50.525 --> 06:52.126
Because                         
you'll never get it.

06:52.161 --> 06:54.762
And I mean that                 
in every sense                  
of the word.

06:56.215 --> 06:57.464
It's a song.

06:57.499 --> 06:58.699
That's it?                      
It's a song?

06:58.733 --> 06:59.967
Mm-hmm.

07:00.002 --> 07:03.004
One little tiny song
            that turned my knees
                    to butter

07:03.038 --> 07:05.306
when I was a teenager   
                 and still does.

07:05.340 --> 07:06.007
Good luck, Sam.

07:06.041 --> 07:07.574
The clock is ticking.

07:07.609 --> 07:08.676
Name that tune.

07:10.312 --> 07:11.345
This is great; a song.

07:11.379 --> 07:12.146
Man, you were right, Frasier.

07:12.181 --> 07:13.331
Thank you.

07:13.365 --> 07:14.898
Wow, what luck, huh?

07:14.933 --> 07:17.034
I mean, how many songs     
         can there be?

07:28.430 --> 07:29.931
I've been going                 
over the books, Norm,

07:29.965 --> 07:32.466
and I think it's time           
to pay your tab.

07:32.501 --> 07:34.852
Oh, gee, thanks, Rebecca.

07:35.921 --> 07:38.355
I mean, it's time for <i>you</i>       
<i>to pay your tab.</i>

07:38.390 --> 07:40.925
Me? I paid it last month.

07:42.060 --> 07:43.294
Okay, okay, fine.

07:43.328 --> 07:46.163
¶ Blue on blue... hea...

07:46.197 --> 07:47.431
No.

07:47.466 --> 07:49.267
¶ Cherish is the word           
that I... ¶

07:49.301 --> 07:50.701
No.

07:50.736 --> 07:53.371
¶ In-a-gadda-da-vida, baby

07:53.405 --> 07:56.507
Right, Sam, 
                I was insane.

07:56.541 --> 07:59.109
I'll find it.

07:59.144 --> 08:00.978
Sam, why don't you try     
      "Che Gelida Manina"

08:01.012 --> 08:02.763
from <i>La Boheme?</i>

08:02.798 --> 08:06.284
It can be almost achingly       
poignant when executed correctly

08:06.318 --> 08:09.853
and it does turn Lilith     
      into a cheap tramp.

08:11.423 --> 08:13.223
Sammy, Sammy, Sammy,

08:13.258 --> 08:14.958
aren't you overlooking          
the obvious here?

08:14.993 --> 08:16.327
Yeah? What's that?

08:16.361 --> 08:18.195
"Ballad of The Green Berets."

08:20.198 --> 08:22.634
Oh, that's a great song.

08:22.668 --> 08:26.036
¶ Fighting soldiers       
        from the sky. ¶

08:26.071 --> 08:28.740
Anybody who isn't totally moved 
          by that song

08:28.774 --> 08:30.508
is somebody           
     I don't want to know.

08:30.542 --> 08:32.677
Cliff, in honor
                  of that song,

08:32.711 --> 08:34.779
why don't you put on    
        a little green beret,

08:34.813 --> 08:38.315
go outside and sit
            on a land mine?

08:41.586 --> 08:43.453
Oh, there you are, Cliff.

08:43.488 --> 08:45.273
Ooh, it's Cliff now, eh?

08:45.307 --> 08:46.574
Training must be going          
very well.

08:46.608 --> 08:48.242
She's a natural.

08:48.277 --> 08:50.010
I'm really sorry                
about today.

08:50.045 --> 08:52.413
I can't believe I missed that   
entire apartment building.

08:52.448 --> 08:54.665
Ah, the tradition               
continues.

08:56.234 --> 08:58.970
Listen, Margaret,   
            why don't we sit    
                down over here

08:59.004 --> 09:02.540
away from those who
    merely wait for the mail?

09:02.574 --> 09:04.609
There you go.

09:04.643 --> 09:05.877
Park it right there.

09:05.911 --> 09:07.311
I just want to tell you, Cliff,

09:07.345 --> 09:09.714
that I couldn't have made it   
 through training without you.

09:09.748 --> 09:11.415
You'll be graduating      
          with honors.

09:11.449 --> 09:13.384
Really?

09:13.418 --> 09:15.386
Well, how could you not, with  
 the recommendation I gave you?

09:15.420 --> 09:18.723
Oh, Cliff, thank you, thank you.

09:18.757 --> 09:19.440
Thank you.

09:25.397 --> 09:28.066
In honor of your achievement,  
             I, uh,

09:28.100 --> 09:31.468
went out and got you
                  a little gift.

09:31.503 --> 09:32.670
Thank you.

09:32.705 --> 09:34.405
You really shouldn't have.

09:34.439 --> 09:37.441
Arch supports.

09:37.475 --> 09:39.059
Yeah, yeah.

09:39.094 --> 09:41.079
I got you the large size, too.

09:41.113 --> 09:44.648
I noticed you've got a pretty  
 hefty pair of dogs down there.

09:46.185 --> 09:48.019
Cliff, you are so considerate.

09:49.054 --> 09:53.190
What we've been through together
      has been so special.

09:53.224 --> 09:54.041
Yeah.

09:54.075 --> 09:56.877
I wish there was a way     
I could be closer to you.

09:56.911 --> 09:59.397
Ah, scootch on over.

09:59.431 --> 10:02.833
No, I didn't...                 
Oh, never mind.

10:02.868 --> 10:04.134
This is so embarrassing.

10:04.168 --> 10:05.469
I'm not good at this.           
I mean,

10:05.504 --> 10:06.303
why would a man                 
like you

10:06.337 --> 10:08.272
even consider                   
someone like me?

10:08.306 --> 10:10.975
What? What in God's name are you
      trying to say here?

10:11.009 --> 10:13.010
Cliff, do you find me           
attractive?

10:13.045 --> 10:14.612
I mean, physically?

10:16.814 --> 10:17.848
Cliff, do you want              
to be with me?

10:17.882 --> 10:18.882
I want to be with you.

10:22.320 --> 10:23.103
So it's a date.

10:23.138 --> 10:24.889
I'll come over to your place    
tomorrow night.

10:24.923 --> 10:25.957
My place?

10:25.991 --> 10:28.292
No. hey, Margaret, Margaret,  
      whoa, hold on there.

10:28.326 --> 10:31.796
Listen, uh, last month
              my mother came out
             and stayed a while,

10:31.830 --> 10:33.430
and she got to know
        the neighbors real well,

10:33.465 --> 10:34.598
and I don't want word   
            getting back to her

10:34.633 --> 10:36.533
that her son            
        does bad things.

10:38.253 --> 10:41.389
Then, uh, why don't we meet     
at that little motel

10:41.423 --> 10:43.841
just outside Zone 27?

10:43.876 --> 10:45.743
Tomorrow night                  
after work?

10:46.979 --> 10:49.380
Yeah, I guess  
                I could make it.

11:09.918 --> 11:12.453
( <i>knocking</i> )

11:20.095 --> 11:21.128
Hi, Cliff.

11:21.163 --> 11:22.796
Hi, Margaret.

11:22.830 --> 11:24.265
Come on in.

11:28.903 --> 11:31.105
I, uh, hope you                 
like the room.

11:31.139 --> 11:34.475
It's... it's got a view.

11:36.744 --> 11:39.246
Oh, the ice machine.

11:39.281 --> 11:41.515
It's just like you          
    to think of everything.

11:45.353 --> 11:47.254
So...

11:47.289 --> 11:51.092
So.

11:51.126 --> 11:54.562
So, uh, let me grab
             your jacket there.

11:56.931 --> 11:58.132
( <i>chuckles</i> )

12:05.740 --> 12:08.775
Cliff, I know                   
this is an awkward moment.

12:08.810 --> 12:11.512
Couldn't we just                
somehow get past it?

12:11.546 --> 12:12.830
I'm for that.

        It's the police!

My first time                   
and I get arrested.

12:35.737 --> 12:38.205
We aren't doing 
            anything illegal.

Yes, officer?

12:48.116 --> 12:48.916
Excuse me.

12:48.951 --> 12:50.818
We're questioning   
                all the guests.

12:50.853 --> 12:51.819
Do you know anything

12:51.854 --> 12:53.921
about this postal           
    vehicle parked outside?

12:53.956 --> 12:55.255
It was reported stolen.

12:59.310 --> 13:02.079
I, uh, no, I don't know anything
    about it, Officer.

13:02.113 --> 13:03.748
Sorry to bother you.

13:03.782 --> 13:05.983
Yeah, not at all, sir.

13:08.119 --> 13:09.152
What, are you crazy?

13:09.187 --> 13:13.341
You, you drove a postal vehicle 
      to a sleazy motel?!

13:13.375 --> 13:16.143
I was running late, and I didn't
want to keep you waiting.

13:16.178 --> 13:17.979
Keep me waiting?

13:18.013 --> 13:20.714
Well, for crying out loud,      
Margaret.

13:20.748 --> 13:23.050
You signed that vehicle out     
in your own name.

13:23.085 --> 13:24.385
Oh, boy.

13:24.419 --> 13:25.619
You've had it now.          
         You've had it.

13:25.653 --> 13:28.022
Oh, they're gonna drum you right
      out of the service.

13:28.056 --> 13:29.857
Well, Cliff,          
     you've got to help me.

13:29.891 --> 13:31.925
You've got to  
                make up a story 
                to cover for me.

13:31.960 --> 13:35.229
You want me to lie?

13:35.263 --> 13:36.297
You want me to jeopardize       
my career?

13:36.331 --> 13:37.798
This is my life.

13:37.832 --> 13:38.832
This is my dream.

13:38.866 --> 13:42.002
This is my shoulder.

13:42.037 --> 13:44.171
This is our story.

13:52.531 --> 13:53.747
Hello, Mrs. Howe?

13:53.782 --> 13:55.015
Um, I work with your daughter.

13:55.049 --> 13:56.350
My name is Sam Malone.

13:56.384 --> 13:57.768
See, I'm calling

13:57.803 --> 14:01.071
to find out what Rebecca's      
    favorite song was

14:01.106 --> 14:02.172
when she was in school.

14:02.207 --> 14:04.141
We're throwing this little party
            for her.

14:04.175 --> 14:06.477
Uh-huh.

14:06.511 --> 14:07.811
Uh-huh, well, thank you.

14:07.846 --> 14:09.647
Yes, I do. Thank you very much.

14:09.681 --> 14:10.414
Bye-bye.

14:10.449 --> 14:13.317
"You've Lost That Loving    
        Feeling."

14:13.352 --> 14:16.487
Oh, no, Sam,                    
I'm just a little tired.

14:19.607 --> 14:21.175
No, Woody, no.

14:21.209 --> 14:22.409
That's Rebecca's song.

14:22.443 --> 14:24.745
Hold the bar down here     
     for a minute, will ya?

14:24.780 --> 14:26.947
I got to get something     
         out of my car.

14:26.982 --> 14:28.882
Hey, Sammy.

14:28.917 --> 14:32.870
Woody, a bottle of bubbly,
                  <i>tout de suite.</i>

14:32.904 --> 14:34.572
All right, Cliffie's in
             a celebrating mood.

14:34.606 --> 14:36.406
That hearing must have gone
            pretty well, huh?

14:36.441 --> 14:38.041
Perfect, Norm.

14:38.076 --> 14:39.844
Margaret was completely
                     exonerated.

14:39.878 --> 14:41.011
You really snowed 'em, huh?

14:41.045 --> 14:43.380
Like a blizzard in Buffalo,
                      my friend.

14:43.414 --> 14:45.549
Yeah, I told the supervisor
        that we were set upon

14:45.584 --> 14:48.018
by some armed thugs who then
    commandeered the vehicle

14:48.052 --> 14:49.520
and took it for a joyride.

14:49.554 --> 14:51.489
A joyride in a mail truck?

14:51.523 --> 14:54.391
Cliffie, I've beaten those      
        things on foot.

14:55.760 --> 14:57.294
Clavin, what's come over you?

14:57.328 --> 14:59.646
I mean you're lying
             to your superiors,

14:59.680 --> 15:02.649
you're breaking rules,
        you're covering up.

15:02.683 --> 15:05.035
It's almost like you're     
developing a personality.

15:05.069 --> 15:08.305
Well, Carla, the King of England
      abdicated his throne

15:08.340 --> 15:10.073
for the love of a good woman.

15:10.108 --> 15:12.243
The least I could do       
     is tell a little fib.

15:13.612 --> 15:15.779
Well, as we say
        down at the post office,

15:15.813 --> 15:17.414
here's looking up   
                your address.

15:21.153 --> 15:23.887
Come on, Maggie,
                     bottoms up.

15:23.921 --> 15:26.423
I can't, Cliff.

15:26.458 --> 15:27.958
Why?

15:27.992 --> 15:29.627
How can we celebrate?

15:29.661 --> 15:31.128
We dishonored the uniform.

15:31.163 --> 15:32.763
I don't feel worthy to wear it.

15:32.797 --> 15:35.032
Yeah, I understand.

15:35.066 --> 15:36.133
Look, uh...

15:36.168 --> 15:38.335
why don't we go         
      back to that motel,

15:38.370 --> 15:39.970
lie down and talk about it, huh?

15:41.473 --> 15:42.873
No, Cliff.

15:42.907 --> 15:44.708
Do you think I fell for you

15:44.742 --> 15:47.278
because you're a handsome,      
sexy man?

15:48.680 --> 15:51.782
I fell for you because          
you're handsome inside.

15:53.351 --> 15:57.288
But now, even though I'm the one
that corrupted you,

15:57.322 --> 15:59.006
you are corrupt.

16:01.042 --> 16:04.161
We're both dirty inside.

16:05.563 --> 16:07.597
Well, let's go back
                to the motel,

16:07.632 --> 16:08.999
they cater to people like us.

16:10.735 --> 16:13.404
No, I can't be
            with you anymore.

16:13.438 --> 16:15.972
I don't feel what I
         felt before. I'm sorry.

16:16.007 --> 16:20.077
Well, uh, is there any way      
we could, you know,

16:20.111 --> 16:22.246
get that feeling back?

16:22.280 --> 16:23.880
We can tell
                 them the truth.

16:23.915 --> 16:25.115
Oh, no, Margaret.

16:25.150 --> 16:28.185
See, if you tell them the truth,
they're gonna know that I lied.

16:28.219 --> 16:29.553
Yes, but with your record,

16:29.587 --> 16:31.155
the worst that will
                happen to us,

16:31.189 --> 16:33.123
is that we'll get  
            a slap on the wrist,

16:33.158 --> 16:35.025
and then we can get on
                 with our lives.

16:35.060 --> 16:37.627
You know what's going           
to happen, don't ya?

16:37.662 --> 16:40.364
What we did back at that motel

16:40.398 --> 16:42.666
is going to become part         
of the postal record.

16:42.700 --> 16:45.169
I can live with that.

16:45.203 --> 16:47.971
Me, too.

16:49.140 --> 16:51.308
Do you think they'd give us
                 a copy of that?

16:54.912 --> 16:59.633
You think they really rode      
     the carnal carrousel?

16:59.667 --> 17:02.569
I think it's possible.

17:02.604 --> 17:04.037
What a thought.

17:04.070 --> 17:05.405
I know.

17:05.439 --> 17:08.074
If you don't mind, I'd kind
        of like to forget it.

18:48.642 --> 18:51.011
So, uh, I can pay this     
    anytime you want.

18:51.045 --> 18:53.447
I don't know what got into me.

18:53.481 --> 18:55.215
Please, apologize to Vera.

18:55.249 --> 18:56.216
Are you kidding?

18:56.250 --> 18:58.185
After that, Vera should     
        apologize to me.

19:01.305 --> 19:04.842
Hey, Mr. Peterson, how'd        
it go with Miss Howe?

19:04.876 --> 19:07.444
Much better than    
              I expected, Woody.

19:12.516 --> 19:15.636
A slap on the wrist
                    she says.

19:15.670 --> 19:18.805
With your record, all we'll get 
is a severe reprimand, she says.

19:18.840 --> 19:20.173
So what happens?

19:20.207 --> 19:26.396
She gets fired and I get six  
 weeks walking dreaded Zone 19.

19:26.430 --> 19:27.714
Zone 19?

19:27.749 --> 19:31.018
Rottweiler Ridge, Norm.

19:33.688 --> 19:35.455
Oh, what the heck.

19:35.489 --> 19:39.893
At least I won back the respect 
of the woman I love, huh?

19:41.229 --> 19:43.530
Maggie,             
    what are you doing here?

19:43.565 --> 19:45.232
Cliff, I've got to talk to you.

19:45.266 --> 19:46.316
What's up?

19:46.350 --> 19:49.235
After I was fired, I wandered  
    around aimlessly,

19:49.270 --> 19:51.938
nowhere to go and didn't know  
          what to do.

19:51.973 --> 19:54.141
And as I was crossing           
the bridge,

19:54.175 --> 19:55.909
I actually thought I'd do       
something desperate.

19:55.943 --> 19:57.210
Oh, no, you don't mean...

19:57.244 --> 19:59.546
Yes, UPS.

20:04.785 --> 20:06.269
Then I thought, why             
should I do that?

20:06.304 --> 20:07.905
There are alternatives.

20:07.939 --> 20:09.940
And I came up with              
a wonderful idea.

20:09.975 --> 20:12.275
The Canadian Postal Service.

20:12.310 --> 20:13.777
Canada?

20:13.812 --> 20:15.779
Geez, why would you want
                 to go up there?

20:15.814 --> 20:17.314
The mail's the mail, Cliff.

20:17.348 --> 20:19.249
It knows no national boundaries.

20:20.085 --> 20:20.851
Come with me.

20:20.885 --> 20:22.086
What?

20:22.120 --> 20:23.386
I've got two tickets, Cliff.

20:23.421 --> 20:25.255
We could start a new life       
there together.

20:25.289 --> 20:27.257
Geez, Maggie, I don't know.

20:27.291 --> 20:29.843
Go, marry her, be happy.

20:29.877 --> 20:31.712
Just don't have any children.

20:35.550 --> 20:39.203
What the heck, I mean,
        we've come this far.

20:39.237 --> 20:41.305
We might as well go the whole   
                nine yards, huh?

20:41.339 --> 20:43.240
Let's go!

20:43.274 --> 20:43.907
Hold on a second.

20:43.941 --> 20:45.525
I'll be right with you.

20:45.560 --> 20:47.760
Normie, pal of mine,

20:47.795 --> 20:49.796
I'll be seeing ya.

20:49.830 --> 20:51.365
It's for the best.

20:51.399 --> 20:53.800
Cliff, did you just kiss
                 me on the neck?

20:53.834 --> 20:55.034
I don't know what it is.

20:55.069 --> 20:57.137
Nobody can keep their   
              lips off me today.

20:58.572 --> 20:59.823
Fras, take care of yourself.

20:59.858 --> 21:01.074
Carla, I forgive you.

21:01.108 --> 21:02.709
Sammy.      
Cliff, wait a minute.

21:02.744 --> 21:04.427
Hey, man, just think about this 
for a minute.

21:04.461 --> 21:05.662
You've only known the girl      
for about a week.

21:05.697 --> 21:09.966
I mean, all you've shared is one
night in a motel and a huge lie.

21:10.001 --> 21:11.785
That's enough for me, Sammy.

21:13.454 --> 21:15.455
Cliff, why don't you consider

21:15.489 --> 21:17.291
what you'd be giving up.

21:17.325 --> 21:20.527
Your job, your seniority,       
your pension.

21:20.561 --> 21:23.297
Hey, Doc, have a gander

21:23.331 --> 21:24.965
at what I'm going   
                  to be gaining.

21:24.999 --> 21:27.534
All right, Maggie, hitch up   
         those huskies.

21:27.568 --> 21:29.136
Canada, here we come.

21:29.170 --> 21:31.605
Uh, Cliff, Cliff...             
Wait a minute, man.

21:31.639 --> 21:32.473
Give this some thought.

21:32.507 --> 21:33.974
Think about what                
you're doing here.

21:34.008 --> 21:36.843
I know what you guys are doing,
            and I appreciate it,

21:36.877 --> 21:39.313
but there's nothing you
                 could do or say

21:39.347 --> 21:41.581
that would make me
            change my mind.

21:43.217 --> 21:46.153
¶ Fearless men who jump     
        and die ¶

21:46.187 --> 21:50.774
¶ Men who mean         
      just what they say ¶

21:50.808 --> 21:55.395
¶ The brave men         
     of the Green Beret. ¶

22:00.735 --> 22:05.205
( <i>humming continues</i> )

22:06.474 --> 22:12.112
Margaret, you're
                 a fine woman,

22:12.147 --> 22:16.383
but I can't leave   
                     my country.

22:16.417 --> 22:18.252
( <i>humming continues</i> )

22:18.286 --> 22:22.573
My place is here,   
                     in America.

22:22.657 --> 22:26.410
I can't leave my home.

22:26.444 --> 22:30.147
Can't you, can't you
             stay here with me?

22:30.181 --> 22:32.015
I'm a mail carrier, Cliff.

22:32.049 --> 22:33.984
I have to deliver               
the mail.

22:37.054 --> 22:38.922
I understand.

22:38.956 --> 22:40.657
( <i>humming continues</i> )

22:40.691 --> 22:42.892
But Cliff, it'll be             
so terrible.

22:42.927 --> 22:45.295
I'll... I'll be so cold         
and all alone.

22:45.330 --> 22:48.332
Who will keep me warm?

22:48.366 --> 22:51.768
You'll do fine, Margaret.

22:51.803 --> 22:53.804
Women have that
             extra layer of fat.

23:00.845 --> 23:04.014
Carry on, O'Keefe.

23:04.048 --> 23:06.750
I'll never forget               
you, Cliff Clavin.

23:08.385 --> 23:09.686
Good-bye.
