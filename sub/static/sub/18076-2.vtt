NARRATOR: In 1972, a crack commando unit
was sent to prison by a miIitary court...

00:59.313 --> 01:00.855
for a crime they didn't commit.

01:00.940 --> 01:03.894
These men promptIy escaped

And B.A., will you just button it?

05:06.978 --> 05:09.813
-He ain't here, man.
-He's probably in the supply room.

At first l thought l was wrong,
but the more l ate here....

05:14.360 --> 05:16.187
Especially the bread.

Just a hint of ginseng.

05:20.950 --> 05:22.492
Remember that?

05:24.579 --> 05:25.907
Wonderful.

POW cuisine is highly underrated.

05:56.319 --> 06:00.268
Do you think the cook at the POW camp
you were at 10 years ago...

No, we really owe it to that little guy.

06:09.290 --> 06:11.496
There was a general in the camp, Amy.

06:11.584 --> 06:14.668
He would starve the prisoners.
Guys were dying of malnutrition.

06:14.754 --> 06:17.589
And Lin Duk Coo
would just sneak them food.

06:38.402 --> 06:40.940
Well, l was a little hesitant to say anything.

06:41.072 --> 06:43.645
l was with society people.

06:43.741 --> 06:48.237
lt didn't seem appropriate to stand up
and call out to him in an elegant restaurant.

-Nobody says ''Ay-yi-yi'' like that.
-What?

08:21.923 --> 08:25.623
Well, when we were in prison camp,
Murdock taught him some Western songs.

The ChisoIm TraiI, you know,
''Come a ti-yi-yipee-yipee-ay.''

08:28.846 --> 08:32.464
Well, that was Lin's favourite expression.
Only he couldn't sing it right.

He used to sing: ''Come a ti-yi-yi-yi-yi.''

08:35.770 --> 08:39.683

they also robbed my bakery truck.

But l make bread, cook like angel.
So, General Chow makes me personal chef.

33:57.375 --> 34:00.660
When he took over prison camp,
l go, l cook.

34:01.546 --> 34:04.001
You're really something, you know that?

34:04.090 --> 34:06.378
lf you are a friend of A-Team...

34:06.467 --> 34:10.594
if they make you a member,
then you really are something, l think.

And now for secret ingredient.

Another common area bites the dust.

34:35.746 --> 34:37.205
What are you doing?

34:37.290 --> 34:40.456
Look, man, Hannibal said
he wants the truck to be armour-plated.

34:40.543 --> 34:43.828
This is the only stuff l could find
that would work.

34:44.714 --> 34:45.876
Hello.

34:46.007 --> 34:48.165
l'm redoing the interiors of the elevators...

[Adventurous instrumental music]

35:47.610 --> 35:50.896
lt's always easier to look the other way,
isn't it, Hannibal?

35:52.156 --> 35:55.240
lnjustice is always rewarded
with indifference.

35:55.952 --> 35:57.197
Yeah, l guess so.

35:57.286 --> 36:01.664
Murdock, when you seal these,
be sure you get all the air out first.

36:03.251 --> 36:04.793

36:10.466 --> 36:13.752
MURDOCK: There it sits
right next to the tee-off area...

36:14.387 --> 36:18.467
and all those naked little balls...

36:18.766 --> 36:21.553
are put into that torture chamber...

36:21.686 --> 36:24.259
and they are slammed up and down...

36:27.859 --> 36:30.694
into those little bodies....

36:35.700 --> 36:37.609
The Golf Ball Liberation Army, huh?

36:37.702 --> 36:41.201
We're organised, but undercapitalised.

36:41.372 --> 36:43.863
Have you ever thought of a telethon?

36:44.375 --> 36:47.044
-No.
-You get Arnold Palmer as the host.

36:48.045 --> 36:50.536
You get Slamming Sammy Sneed...

36:51.007 --> 36:55.669
to tote up the board and lament all
those balls he's knocked the covers off.

36:57.930 --> 37:01.264
That is a wonderful idea, Colonel.

Here you go, kid.
Ten packs of Sweet 'N Low.
