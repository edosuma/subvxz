00:27.160 --> 00:28.880
[Being back on the right path]

00:28.960 --> 00:30.240
You will hurt yourself!

00:30.320 --> 00:32.640
-Dad!
-You will get hurt, my son.

00:33.920 --> 00:35.000
Dad,

00:35.320 --> 00:37.280
I am in total bliss.

00:37.360 --> 00:41.760
I am too if you are.

00:43.680 --> 00:45.040
[Could I be...]

00:46.000 --> 00:48.280
[at Lord Park Seung's residence?]

00:48.360 --> 00:49.880
Here is your pay.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.040
Oh, right.

00:53.400 --> 00:54.680
Thank you.

00:57.160 --> 01:00.160
My, you did an excellent job.

01:00.920 --> 01:02.920
Could you finish
our young master's clothes soon too?

01:03.840 --> 01:04.840
Of course.

01:07.040 --> 01:10.039
Gosh, my stomach hurts.

01:11.480 --> 01:13.880
My apologies,
but I am feeling nature's calls.

01:14.080 --> 01:16.320
May I quickly use your outhouse?

01:16.560 --> 01:17.720
The outhouse?

01:18.000 --> 01:20.080
My gosh,
I suddenly have a bad stomachache.

01:20.520 --> 01:23.560
It is over there. Be quick.

01:24.680 --> 01:26.320
I will. Thank you.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.160
No! It did not turn over.

01:35.039 --> 01:36.880
-Darn it. It did not work.
-Nice.

01:38.920 --> 01:41.800
-No! That was close.
-Let me show you how it is done.

01:42.920 --> 01:44.880
-My turn.
-No!

01:45.320 --> 01:47.960
-This has got to work!
-My gosh!

01:49.000 --> 01:51.840
[The evidence
Lord Yi-eon risked his life to find...]

01:51.920 --> 01:53.759
Darn it. Why can I not flip it over?

01:55.840 --> 01:58.000
Oh, no! It did not flip.

01:59.759 --> 02:03.000
-You cannot flip mine over.
-Why is this so hard?

-Father.
-Yes?

02:23.040 --> 02:27.680
You know, it is awfully boring
to be stuck at home.

02:27.760 --> 02:31.440
I said you were ill
and paid a hefty bribe to get you out.

02:31.520 --> 02:34.880
It would make me look bad
if you were out and about so soon.

02:35.280 --> 02:38.520
Father, then what about my villa?

02:38.600 --> 02:41.000
-What?
-I want to see it.

02:41.960 --> 02:44.640
Well, it would be nice
to get some fresh air anyway.

02:44.720 --> 02:47.240
Shall we go take a look around?

02:47.320 --> 02:49.000
My gosh! Can we do that?

02:49.079 --> 02:52.120
Yes, of course! Anything you want, son.

02:52.200 --> 02:54.120
We can do anything!

02:54.280 --> 02:55.520
My lord.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.120
Your new socks are ready.

02:59.240 --> 03:00.840
Okay, good.

03:01.480 --> 03:02.960
Go away!

03:04.040 --> 03:05.200
Let me see.

03:06.240 --> 03:07.640
Let me have a look.

03:07.760 --> 03:09.080
Oh, my!

03:10.040 --> 03:13.760
Look at this lovely curve.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.000
They fit me perfectly.

05:08.520 --> 05:10.000
It is a completely different place.

05:10.080 --> 05:11.880
Most of what you take
will become trash anyway.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.920
Trash or not, it is for us to take.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.560
I do not appreciate your nagging.

05:18.640 --> 05:19.960
Have you found a boat yet?

05:20.040 --> 05:21.800
Arrive at the port by noon
on the last day of the month,

05:21.880 --> 05:24.200
and Yoon, one of Gokdu's messengers,
will be waiting for you.

05:24.760 --> 05:26.760
Just follow Yoon's instructions.

05:29.040 --> 05:30.840
Thank you for keeping your word.

05:31.440 --> 05:34.880
And I would like to thank you
for not kicking me out.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.400
I am sure you are prepared,
but even if you manage to get there,

05:44.159 --> 05:47.320
it will not be easy to settle down there.

05:47.760 --> 05:48.880
I am aware,

05:50.000 --> 05:53.520
but we cannot just get used
to being persecuted here.

05:53.760 --> 05:55.680
How about you use that grit and hold out?

05:56.320 --> 05:57.600
Hold out?

05:59.800 --> 06:01.200
Do you think

06:01.280 --> 06:03.800
this country will change
if we just "hold out"?

06:08.440 --> 06:10.400
You should leave
if you absolutely despise this place.

06:11.560 --> 06:12.800
What can you do?

06:15.320 --> 06:18.000
So you have decided to voluntarily go
to the Office of Special Justice?

06:18.800 --> 06:20.360
That lunatic, Tae-seo, thinks we should.

06:21.080 --> 06:23.680
If you turn yourself in,
it will put you in a good light,

06:23.880 --> 06:26.400
so you could hope for a lighter sentence.

06:26.920 --> 06:29.720
You can say that
because you did not harm anyone.

06:30.920 --> 06:31.920
But in my case, it is different.

06:32.240 --> 06:33.880
I cannot wish for a lighter sentence.

06:34.960 --> 06:36.520
All I am hoping is that

06:36.600 --> 06:38.920
our confession will help reveal
who Park Seung really is.

06:39.920 --> 06:42.440
That shall be our last act of remorse.

06:44.040 --> 06:46.080
As long as you are prepared
for what is to come.

06:50.480 --> 06:53.960
Actually, there is something
I always wanted to ask.

06:55.280 --> 06:57.800
Why are you so devoted?

06:58.680 --> 07:02.040
The women and slaves here... Who are they?

07:02.880 --> 07:04.000
They are

07:04.480 --> 07:07.000
just like you and me.

07:07.600 --> 07:10.360
They are not just women or slaves.

07:13.440 --> 07:15.560
Everyone has a right to live,

07:16.160 --> 07:18.720
and we simply joined forces
to protect that right.

07:19.400 --> 07:20.840
It is not out of devotion.

07:28.960 --> 07:30.360
Han-ki, we should leave.

07:31.520 --> 07:32.920
I must go.

07:33.680 --> 07:36.920
I truly hope you achieve all your goals.

08:10.880 --> 08:12.760
-I am late.
-That is okay.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.480
Thank you for coming.

08:14.560 --> 08:17.640
Is something wrong?
It is not the deadline yet.

08:18.400 --> 08:20.000
As I mentioned last time,

08:20.480 --> 08:22.760
we have decided to leave this place.

08:23.280 --> 08:25.480
I cannot thank you enough
for your help and support thus far,

08:25.840 --> 08:28.480
and I apologize for
not being able to keep this place going.

08:29.360 --> 08:31.240
You need not apologize to me.

08:32.039 --> 08:33.919
I am just the messenger.

08:34.280 --> 08:37.240
I do not know when and if
I can meet you again once I leave,

08:37.320 --> 08:40.760
so I must ask a favor of you.

08:42.440 --> 08:45.360
The person who has been
sponsoring us so far.

08:46.040 --> 08:47.960
Could you please tell me who it is?

08:48.040 --> 08:49.840
You promised not to ask.

08:49.920 --> 08:51.840
I understand that
we are on the receiving end,

08:51.920 --> 08:54.040
but it does not mean we have no shame.

08:54.720 --> 08:56.480
Once we leave,

08:56.640 --> 08:59.600
we may not get to set foot
on this land ever again.

09:10.160 --> 09:11.800
Your initial supporter

09:12.960 --> 09:14.680
was the late Crown Prince.

09:16.440 --> 09:18.320
He felt sorry for the women
who had returned

09:18.400 --> 09:20.560
for they were banished yet again,

09:21.120 --> 09:22.560
so he wished to help them.

09:25.480 --> 09:26.600
However,

09:27.360 --> 09:29.960
it has been a long time
since the Crown Prince passed away.

09:30.360 --> 09:33.880
After the Crown Prince's passing,
a man you could call his sworn brother

09:34.600 --> 09:37.960
took on his will
and continued to support you.

09:39.360 --> 09:41.080
May I ask who he is?

09:43.080 --> 09:44.520
Who is he?

09:50.040 --> 09:51.200
In the Office of Special Counselors...

10:01.200 --> 10:02.960
[Lord Ra Yi-eon.]

10:06.960 --> 10:09.840
[He is Junior Sixth Counselor Ra
of the Office of Special Counselors.]

10:10.520 --> 10:12.160
They met while he was dispatched
to Chungcheong Province

10:12.240 --> 10:13.320
as a secret royal inspector.

10:13.400 --> 10:15.840
And I believe he still keeps her close.

10:26.920 --> 10:28.840
Bi-ryeong, hey!

10:28.920 --> 10:30.040
What is it?

10:30.120 --> 10:31.800
-The socks.
-What?

10:31.880 --> 10:35.000
The socks I had made
were for Lord Park Seung.

10:35.280 --> 10:37.480
So you were at
Lord Park Seung's residence?

10:38.920 --> 10:39.920
What?

10:40.960 --> 10:43.120
You paid a visit
to Lord Park Seung's house?

10:43.400 --> 10:44.360
Yes.

10:44.440 --> 10:47.880
That means the one who asked
for a pocket near the sock cuff

10:47.960 --> 10:49.440
was Lord Park Seung, right?

10:49.720 --> 10:54.080
Yes. I saw him change
into the socks I made,

10:54.280 --> 10:57.960
and he slipped a letter inside
to carry around with him.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.560
It must be a really important letter

11:01.000 --> 11:03.600
to have to carry it around with him.

11:10.320 --> 11:12.280
By the way, this straw shoe.

11:13.400 --> 11:15.440
Why is only this part different?

11:15.960 --> 11:17.040
What?

11:26.440 --> 11:27.560
What is this?

11:28.800 --> 11:29.800
Goodness.

11:37.280 --> 11:38.320
This...

11:41.160 --> 11:42.920
It is the ingredients
of the herbal decoction.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.640
Musk, 1.5 don.

11:50.040 --> 11:51.360
Radix sophorae flavescentis, 2 don.

11:51.760 --> 11:54.760
[Gwang-soon,
my prescription was never wrong.]

11:54.880 --> 11:56.880
I put in
the exact amount of angelica roots

11:56.960 --> 11:57.960
and aconite...

11:59.200 --> 12:00.400
My father...

12:01.480 --> 12:04.120
left the ingredients
of the herbal decoction as evidence.

12:06.360 --> 12:08.520
To inform that the crown prince
was poisoned.

12:36.440 --> 12:38.040
Do-soo!

12:39.080 --> 12:41.280
You should not take it!

12:41.400 --> 12:43.360
Why not? I had these before.

12:44.280 --> 12:46.920
These are poppy capsules
partially made with aconite.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.080
Aconite?

12:52.200 --> 12:54.760
I had them ordered specially for the king.

12:54.880 --> 12:55.880
So...

12:59.680 --> 13:01.000
have these instead.

13:06.720 --> 13:08.000
If it is for the king...

13:09.600 --> 13:13.960
It is about time
His Majesty joins the Crown Prince.

13:17.320 --> 13:20.080
Anyway, these have aconite in them,

13:20.360 --> 13:23.040
so do not touch them. All right?

13:24.360 --> 13:26.320
Yes, understood.

13:36.280 --> 13:39.040
I would have come home much earlier
if only I had not lost my way.

13:39.320 --> 13:40.920
Why did I make the wrong turn?

13:43.320 --> 13:44.400
Goodness.

13:53.960 --> 13:55.800
[Park Seung]

14:59.000 --> 15:02.600
[I am sure he was described
as a stylish man.]

15:06.440 --> 15:07.720
Pardon the intrusion.

15:13.240 --> 15:14.920
Who may you be?

15:15.000 --> 15:18.920
Are you Lord Ra Yi-eon?

15:30.400 --> 15:31.480
I am.

15:31.920 --> 15:34.560
Lord Yi-eon, how was your trip?

15:34.800 --> 15:36.240
Gosh, your clothes are a mess.

15:36.560 --> 15:38.560
So, have you looked
into the abscess specialist?

15:38.640 --> 15:39.680
Well...

15:42.400 --> 15:44.720
-Who is she?
-My lord!

15:45.080 --> 15:46.280
Who are you?

15:48.080 --> 15:50.480
The abscess specialist turns out to be

15:50.720 --> 15:52.320
Gwang-soon's father.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.560
Welcome back, Lord Yi-eon.

15:56.760 --> 15:58.640
Listen. At Lord Park Seung's house...

16:02.720 --> 16:03.800
Mother?

16:05.280 --> 16:06.520
-Mother?
-Mother?

16:06.600 --> 16:07.680
Mom?

16:11.040 --> 16:12.040
Your mother-in-law?

16:15.720 --> 16:16.800
Jo-yi's mother?

16:16.960 --> 16:18.760
Yes.

16:21.040 --> 16:23.440
So to summarize,

16:24.040 --> 16:26.120
you are Jo-yi's mother,

16:26.360 --> 16:28.800
your patron was His Royal Highness

16:28.880 --> 16:31.120
while the daughter of His Majesty's
abscess specialist is you.

16:31.360 --> 16:32.880
And next to you is Bi-ryeong

16:32.960 --> 16:35.480
whose older brother and younger siblings
are with you.

16:35.560 --> 16:37.840
Now, I am your patron,
and next to me is Jo-yi,

16:37.920 --> 16:38.880
next to her is Goo-pal,

16:38.960 --> 16:40.040
next to him is Yuk-chil,

16:40.120 --> 16:41.280
next to him is Gwang-soon.

16:41.360 --> 16:43.160
Her father used
to serve His Royal Highness,

16:43.320 --> 16:45.840
and His Royal Highness
was like an older brother to me.

16:45.960 --> 16:47.120
But he was also your patron,

16:47.200 --> 16:49.440
and at the same time,
you are Jo-yi's mother

16:49.520 --> 16:50.960
so to me, you are...

16:51.040 --> 16:53.000
Stop, Young Master!

16:55.000 --> 16:57.720
Okay, got it.

16:58.920 --> 17:01.080
Right. Anyway,

17:01.320 --> 17:03.640
They say things in life
are fated by our previous lives.

17:04.079 --> 17:07.680
So we must have a special fate
to have gathered here together.

17:10.319 --> 17:12.119
Gosh, what a fate, right?

17:12.720 --> 17:14.480
That means we were meant to be.

17:16.599 --> 17:18.880
All of us here must repay

17:18.960 --> 17:20.599
for His Royal Highness's kindness.

17:21.160 --> 17:23.680
It is the will of the sky

17:23.960 --> 17:25.560
that we have gathered today.

17:26.160 --> 17:28.040
And that is to punish Park Seung,

17:28.920 --> 17:30.680
the mastermind behind all these incidents.

17:36.560 --> 17:40.520
This is the letter Park Seung wrote after
he threatened the abscess specialist

17:40.960 --> 17:43.400
to keep the fact that he poisoned
the Crown Prince a secret.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.120
[In exchange for your silence regarding]

17:53.240 --> 17:55.360
[all that you saw and heard
at the new Medicines Department]

17:55.760 --> 17:58.840
[as well as your cooperation
delivering the herbal decoction]

17:59.160 --> 18:02.360
[served to the Crown Prince,
I hereby promise that I will not threaten]

18:02.440 --> 18:04.720
[the life of your daughter Ra Gwang-soon.]

18:06.400 --> 18:09.480
Unfortunately, this letter has become

18:10.200 --> 18:11.880
your father's will,

18:13.720 --> 18:14.960
but he did everything

18:15.960 --> 18:18.360
to protect you, his daughter.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.280
I had no idea.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.720
Rather, I thought he had thrown me away,

18:26.960 --> 18:29.000
so I resented him deeply.

18:32.960 --> 18:34.680
But it was all to protect me.

18:43.920 --> 18:46.120
This is my father's keepsake.

18:48.560 --> 18:49.760
What is it?

18:51.040 --> 18:53.800
It is the ingredients that went into
the Crown Prince's herbal decoction.

18:54.400 --> 18:58.160
Father must have left it as evidence
that the Crown Prince was poisoned.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.640
The letter with Park Seung's stamp,

19:05.040 --> 19:07.840
the list of herbal decoction ingredients
with the abscess specialist's stamp,

19:08.040 --> 19:11.120
and Park Tae-seo's confession,
though we must wait and see

19:11.440 --> 19:13.200
if he will keep his promise.
With all that...

19:13.400 --> 19:15.000
He will keep it.

19:16.880 --> 19:20.520
I saw them make up their mind
in Ganghwa Island.

19:21.440 --> 19:24.120
By now, Park Tae-seo, Ji Maeng-soo,

19:24.760 --> 19:27.360
and Kang Han-ki
would have arrived at Hanyang.

19:32.440 --> 19:34.760
-Look.
-Dad, is this really all ours?

19:34.840 --> 19:37.000
Yes, this is all yours.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.480
-Be careful my boy.
-Come on.

19:40.560 --> 19:41.680
All right. I'm coming.

19:42.400 --> 19:45.960
Goodness. I am as joyful as you are.

19:47.840 --> 19:49.160
It is even better than I thought.

19:49.240 --> 19:51.680
What about this could be bringing you joy?

19:51.760 --> 19:53.000
Everything.

19:53.280 --> 19:56.880
But most of all, I appreciate the fact

19:56.960 --> 19:58.600
that we are out here together.

19:59.360 --> 20:01.920
Goodness, my sweet boy.

20:03.200 --> 20:05.080
My precious son.

20:06.040 --> 20:07.400
Of course.

20:08.600 --> 20:12.000
I am thrilled to be out with you as well.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.880
-Shall we?
-Absolutely.

20:28.920 --> 20:30.120
There is no need to feel guilty.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.960
I have not been able
to get Mal-jong off my mind either.

20:35.920 --> 20:37.560
Likewise.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.960
Others would not accept me
because of my gender,

20:40.680 --> 20:42.200
but you did.

20:43.320 --> 20:44.920
That is when I promised myself

20:45.880 --> 20:47.920
that I would drink poison
if you ordered me to.

20:55.040 --> 20:58.560
Hey, Maeng-soo.
What do you think you will be reborn as?

20:59.640 --> 21:01.040
A tiger, of course.

21:02.560 --> 21:04.400
As if that would ever happen.

21:04.480 --> 21:06.560
-A cat could be in your cards though.
-Seriously?

21:08.600 --> 21:10.920
It suits you better, you know.

21:16.320 --> 21:18.960
Just a second.
I will catch up with you later.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.000
-Do-soo.
-Dad!

21:23.080 --> 21:26.000
Slow down, will you?

21:26.480 --> 21:27.480
Goodness.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.240
Do-soo.

21:30.680 --> 21:32.960
Gosh, my boy.

21:33.400 --> 21:34.840
Watch your step!

21:39.480 --> 21:40.560
Mother.

21:43.640 --> 21:44.720
Mother.

21:54.840 --> 21:55.960
Mother.

21:57.160 --> 21:58.640
No matter what others say,

22:01.680 --> 22:03.400
you will always be my mother.

22:06.240 --> 22:09.880
You may think that
a four-year-old would remember nothing,

22:12.520 --> 22:14.120
but that is not the case.

22:17.360 --> 22:20.040
I remember how fond of me you were.

22:24.960 --> 22:26.120
And...

22:30.120 --> 22:32.000
I know it was true love.

22:37.920 --> 22:39.520
Wherever you may be,

22:41.840 --> 22:43.120
I will wish you good health.

23:19.480 --> 23:20.640
Tae-seo!

23:42.440 --> 23:45.080
It must really be my lucky day today.

23:45.160 --> 23:46.760
Fancy seeing you here.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.120
Do-soo...

24:05.960 --> 24:08.520
Do-soo, you...

24:09.760 --> 24:11.840
Do-soo?

24:20.080 --> 24:22.720
Time was of the essence, Dad.

24:22.800 --> 24:24.600
He could run away again.

24:36.200 --> 24:37.680
Father...

24:41.360 --> 24:42.880
Let us go.

24:42.960 --> 24:44.840
We should grab a bite to eat.

24:52.440 --> 24:53.960
Tae-seo is gone,

24:54.040 --> 24:56.320
and there is no one left to confess.

24:56.560 --> 24:58.200
Talk about a perfect day.

25:01.440 --> 25:03.080
Kill the others as well.

25:27.840 --> 25:32.040
[Why did I even bother
to go to great lengths?]

25:33.240 --> 25:35.600
[The reason is lost on me now.]

25:52.360 --> 25:55.480
[It is a hat strap
with our family's seal.]

25:57.600 --> 25:58.760
Son?

25:59.680 --> 26:00.800
Yes,

26:02.520 --> 26:03.600
Father.

26:08.360 --> 26:10.800
[The smile you wore that day.]

26:12.160 --> 26:14.200
[I wish to believe
that it came from your heart.]

26:52.960 --> 26:54.480
Good job, everyone.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.960
You should all go home
and get the rest you reserve.

26:57.040 --> 27:00.320
-Good night, my lord.
-We will see you tomorrow.

27:01.400 --> 27:03.480
-Have a good night.
-You too.

27:04.560 --> 27:06.520
All this time,

27:06.640 --> 27:08.640
I have been letting
Left Wing Guard support us.

27:08.720 --> 27:10.440
I only just found out
who our benefactor is.

27:11.240 --> 27:13.720
Forgive me
for the belated words of gratitude.

27:14.160 --> 27:17.320
This is highly unnecessary.
I was only following in the footsteps

27:17.400 --> 27:19.080
of the late Crown Prince.

27:19.960 --> 27:23.040
I feel guilty for not knowing about
your situation until it was too late.

27:26.960 --> 27:30.920
You should come home with us. We can--

27:31.000 --> 27:33.320
That is not necessary.
I can stay at a tavern.

27:33.400 --> 27:36.760
My goodness.
When your daughter lives so close by?

27:36.840 --> 27:38.360
Come with us, ma'am.

27:38.440 --> 27:40.600
-Let us escort you.
-Goodness.

27:40.680 --> 27:42.160
It is dark, so please watch your step.

27:46.120 --> 27:48.240
I will get going as well.

27:48.560 --> 27:49.720
Jo-yi,

27:51.240 --> 27:52.920
could you wait a few moments?

27:59.960 --> 28:00.960
What...

28:03.040 --> 28:05.480
I would love nothing more
than to cook for her,

28:05.720 --> 28:08.400
but you should do it since
it could make her feel uncomfortable.

28:11.320 --> 28:15.000
These are homemade dried acorn jelly,
so enjoy it as a salad.

28:15.520 --> 28:17.440
I am grateful, my lord.

28:18.200 --> 28:20.000
I will get going then.

28:20.560 --> 28:24.000
-Mother!
-Add crown daisies to the salad...

28:26.520 --> 28:27.880
You will enjoy the aroma.

28:39.280 --> 28:42.080
[Mother, dinner will soon be served,]

28:42.160 --> 28:43.920
[so take a look around my room.]

28:53.520 --> 28:55.360
These are the only clean ones we have.

28:55.440 --> 28:57.880
Thank you. They are more than enough.

28:58.320 --> 29:01.200
The fire was added a few moments ago,

29:01.320 --> 29:02.960
so the floor will heat up soon.

29:10.680 --> 29:13.840
Jo-yi must have gotten
her crafting skills from you.

29:15.120 --> 29:17.920
There is nothing she cannot do.
She is good at sewing

29:18.000 --> 29:19.920
and does laundry well
due to having strong arms.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.760
She throws quite the punch as well.

29:21.840 --> 29:24.240
Then you are right.
I pack a heavy punch myself.

29:27.200 --> 29:28.760
All right.

29:30.840 --> 29:32.760
Here we go, everyone.

29:34.600 --> 29:37.640
I made a stew
with the mushrooms Lord Yi-eon gave us.

29:37.840 --> 29:39.640
-I am famished.
-Eat up.

29:40.680 --> 29:43.520
Oh, Lord Yi-eon made

29:43.600 --> 29:44.960
this dried acorn jelly.

29:45.280 --> 29:46.600
Try it.

29:46.920 --> 29:49.280
He made acorn jelly himself?

29:49.640 --> 29:51.640
Oh, this is nothing.

29:51.800 --> 29:54.360
He is a better cook
than most women I know.

29:59.960 --> 30:02.800
Lord Yi-eon really made this himself
from scratch?

30:03.560 --> 30:06.480
This is not the only thing he is good at.
He is a man of many talents.

30:07.600 --> 30:09.240
Good for you, Jo-yi.

30:09.920 --> 30:13.880
Well, the tall one is my dear Yuk-chil.
He also has many skills of his own.

30:14.920 --> 30:16.240
My dear Yuk-chil?

30:16.840 --> 30:19.760
The same goes for my dear Goo-pal...

30:19.840 --> 30:22.040
Too late. Right?
She said it a moment too late.

30:22.440 --> 30:23.920
My goodness.

30:25.680 --> 30:28.080
Hey, this dried acorn jelly is very good.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.280
It is, indeed.

30:33.440 --> 30:35.800
[My gosh. Will you keep still?]

30:35.880 --> 30:37.280
[I said, you do not need to do this.]

30:37.360 --> 30:39.360
[I want to do this for you.]

30:39.440 --> 30:40.480
[My goodness.]

30:40.760 --> 30:42.000
[There, it is done.]

30:47.200 --> 30:48.520
Your feet...

30:55.200 --> 30:57.200
They say applying sponge gourd juice

30:57.320 --> 30:59.080
can help turn rough skin smooth.

30:59.560 --> 31:01.720
But I may not find them
as they are not in season now.

31:02.240 --> 31:04.200
Tomorrow, I will buy some honey
to use instead.

31:04.560 --> 31:07.480
It is only natural for the skin
to get rough with age.

31:07.920 --> 31:08.920
Do not fret.

31:13.960 --> 31:16.920
Come here. Let me brush your hair.

31:33.040 --> 31:36.680
This comb... Where did you get it?

31:37.440 --> 31:40.000
Does this belong to the girl
named Bi-ryeong?

31:40.240 --> 31:42.920
Oh, this. It is not Bi-ryeong's.

31:43.040 --> 31:45.840
Well, it is a long story.

31:46.000 --> 31:50.320
Bi-ryeong and Bo-ri look so much alike
that even I get confused sometimes.

31:51.120 --> 31:54.240
Anyway, it is not from Bi-ryeong.

31:54.360 --> 31:58.280
My friend, Bo-ri, gave it to me
back when I lived in Gyehwa Valley.

32:00.480 --> 32:01.560
Bo-ri?

32:06.000 --> 32:08.080
Why do you ask?

32:22.000 --> 32:24.120
[You always used that broken comb,
but this is new.]

32:24.200 --> 32:27.000
A lady gave it to me earlier.

32:27.440 --> 32:29.800
That reminds me, she was looking for you.

32:29.880 --> 32:30.840
Me?

32:30.920 --> 32:33.200
She asked where your house was,
so I told her. Did she not drop by?

32:34.480 --> 32:37.920
Then... Did you...

32:41.720 --> 32:44.160
You came to Gyehwa Valley.

32:47.560 --> 32:49.680
You came to see me.

32:54.080 --> 32:56.280
They say nothing in life is a coincidence.

32:56.360 --> 32:58.920
Such occurrences form layers and lead you
to where you should be in life.

33:02.520 --> 33:04.920
Even this comb had a purpose.

33:11.120 --> 33:12.480
Let me comb your hair.

33:16.880 --> 33:17.920
All right.

33:38.920 --> 33:39.880
How lovely.

33:39.960 --> 33:42.280
[Mother. Today, I got to eat with you]

33:42.480 --> 33:43.920
[and make you new clothes.]

33:44.240 --> 33:45.920
[You combed my hair too.]

33:47.040 --> 33:48.600
[It was like a dream.]

33:49.040 --> 33:51.800
[I never thought this day would come.]

33:52.040 --> 33:54.480
[I kept thinking of when I was younger.]

33:54.880 --> 33:57.400
[-Me too.
-By the way,]

33:57.480 --> 33:59.440
[the dried acorn jelly was so good,
was it not?]

33:59.560 --> 34:01.440
[-Yes, it was very delicious.
-Right?]

34:08.400 --> 34:09.880
Oh, who might you be?

34:10.400 --> 34:13.000
Is Yoo Deok-bong here by any chance?

34:13.400 --> 34:14.760
Right, yes.

34:16.960 --> 34:19.120
Mother, someone is here to see you.

34:22.320 --> 34:24.520
What brings you all the way here?

34:25.000 --> 34:28.440
Tail Island... Our island...

34:29.159 --> 34:32.320
Park Seung has taken over the island.

34:35.440 --> 34:37.760
What about the children? And Ba-hoe?

34:38.040 --> 34:39.719
What about Dae-ki and the other women?

34:39.960 --> 34:43.159
Dae-ki managed to get away with the kids.

34:44.120 --> 34:46.560
But Ba-hoe...

34:47.520 --> 34:48.960
Ba-hoe is...

34:50.080 --> 34:51.880
They are not on any family register.

34:51.960 --> 34:53.239
Take them all.

34:57.120 --> 34:58.720
-No...
-Darn you!

35:19.880 --> 35:21.000
Mother.

35:26.880 --> 35:28.240
Park Tae-seo was killed?

35:28.360 --> 35:31.680
He was on his way to the port
with his friends to turn himself in,

35:31.880 --> 35:34.560
but Park Seung and his son
came to Ganghwa Island and killed them.

35:35.280 --> 35:37.240
She saw it happen.

35:38.120 --> 35:40.960
How could someone be so evil?

35:41.240 --> 35:43.840
He may be an illegitimate son,
but he is still his child!

35:43.920 --> 35:45.040
No.

35:47.080 --> 35:50.640
Tae-seo is his legitimate son, not Do-soo.

35:52.480 --> 35:55.000
I swapped them as babies.

35:55.680 --> 35:58.320
I am aware that this may cost me my life,

35:58.680 --> 36:01.960
but I must see
that scoundrel, Park Seung, die.

36:02.200 --> 36:03.960
I will do anything.

36:04.320 --> 36:07.680
Hence, I am determined
to bring Park Seung down.

36:07.960 --> 36:11.280
Please allow us to help you,
so he gets the punishment he deserves.

36:21.080 --> 36:22.200
You are such a good eater.

36:22.320 --> 36:24.080
-Good boy.
[-We have the same goal.]

36:24.880 --> 36:26.200
[Taking Park Seung down.]

36:27.280 --> 36:30.880
However, Park Seung even managed
to get out of the interrogation.

36:31.320 --> 36:34.360
If we go after him with only his letter

36:34.720 --> 36:37.000
and the physician's list of ingredients
for the herbal decoction

36:37.120 --> 36:38.480
without Park Tae-seo's confession,

36:39.040 --> 36:40.680
it may backfire on us.

36:46.240 --> 36:49.520
Did you say that you saw Park Seung
put a letter in his sock?

36:50.160 --> 36:53.120
Yes. There was definitely
a letter in the sock.

36:53.600 --> 36:55.800
I must find out what it says.

36:56.360 --> 36:58.960
But according to his servants...

37:01.160 --> 37:04.360
Apparently, he keeps his socks on
even when he goes to sleep.

37:08.400 --> 37:11.000
[Well, he must wash his feet.]

37:19.800 --> 37:21.880
[Does he not even visit a kisaeng house?]

37:22.480 --> 37:25.720
No, never. He claims that he is not well
and does not even go to work

37:24.440 --> 37:28.440
[Chingbyeonghyujik: Sick leave]

37:26.080 --> 37:27.280
these days.

37:27.360 --> 37:29.600
Here. Open wide.

37:30.960 --> 37:32.000
Eat slowly.

37:32.080 --> 37:35.480
[He is busy caring for Park Do-soo,
so he rarely leaves home.]

37:35.880 --> 37:38.960
He does leave the house once in a while,
but that is to go to Banchon

37:39.520 --> 37:41.120
to visit the butcher shop.

37:39.640 --> 37:41.240
[Hyeonbang: Butcher shop]

37:41.520 --> 37:42.680
That is right.

37:44.520 --> 37:47.840
My lord, I saw Lord Park Seung

37:47.960 --> 37:50.360
buy something called "poppy capsules"
at the butcher's.

37:50.880 --> 37:51.920
Poppy capsules?

37:52.000 --> 37:54.640
Yes. That is what I heard him say.

37:54.800 --> 37:56.960
It is an anesthetic tablet given to cows

37:57.040 --> 37:58.440
before slaughter to dull the pain.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.120
That is why butchers have them.

38:01.320 --> 38:03.560
It is also a hallucinogenic drug.

38:03.920 --> 38:05.560
You see things when you take them.

38:06.560 --> 38:08.680
You see things...

38:11.800 --> 38:14.200
Oh, then how about we do this?

38:16.800 --> 38:17.880
Gather round.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.960
Would that work?

38:37.280 --> 38:40.880
Whether it does or not,
we must try and find out.

38:41.520 --> 38:43.000
-Let us try!
-Let us try!

38:53.000 --> 38:55.080
Very well. Then I shall

38:55.440 --> 38:57.640
find a way
to get an audience with His Majesty.

38:58.040 --> 38:59.280
If you get the letter,

38:59.360 --> 39:01.760
I will go to the Palace
with the evidence we have

39:02.080 --> 39:03.880
and get an arrest warrant on Park Seung.

39:04.360 --> 39:07.040
If you manage to arrest him,

39:07.320 --> 39:10.320
we will put together a plan
to take him down for good.

39:13.160 --> 39:14.320
Very well.

39:16.040 --> 39:17.040
Let us get to work.

39:17.120 --> 39:18.360
-Yes, my lord!
-Yes, my lord!

39:57.360 --> 40:00.000
-Become tasty!
-Become thicker!

40:04.160 --> 40:07.000
-Become tasty!
-Become tasty!

40:34.120 --> 40:37.280
Please make sure His Majesty
gets a taste of this injeolmi I made.

40:37.720 --> 40:40.560
I am sure he will ask for me.

40:40.840 --> 40:43.360
And when he does, I will visit him myself.

40:44.040 --> 40:45.160
Understood.

41:16.040 --> 41:16.920
Got you!

41:28.960 --> 41:30.680
Dad!

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
You scared me!

42:00.920 --> 42:04.000
Come with me.

42:05.720 --> 42:07.280
Dad!

42:12.880 --> 42:15.840
Gwang-soon, be careful!
Just a little bit more.

42:16.080 --> 42:17.960
-Up you go.
-Goodness.

42:19.080 --> 42:20.480
I almost died.

42:20.880 --> 42:22.600
And I was going to follow you.

42:23.400 --> 42:24.920
Let us go!

42:25.000 --> 42:26.760
Dad!

42:27.400 --> 42:29.960
Do-soo! What is wrong?

42:31.880 --> 42:33.760
Ghosts! I saw ghosts outside!

42:34.080 --> 42:37.000
My hat flew around and...

42:37.080 --> 42:40.960
Gosh, my baby boy.
What are you going on about?

42:41.040 --> 42:42.880
From the well,

42:43.440 --> 42:44.960
a grim reaper...

42:45.040 --> 42:47.640
This is all because
you have a weak body and mind.

42:47.720 --> 42:51.080
Let us call over a doctor
to make you some herbal decoction.

42:51.320 --> 42:52.560
Come now.

42:55.200 --> 42:56.800
Do-soo. Do-soo?

42:57.600 --> 43:00.000
Do-soo? Do-soo!

43:06.040 --> 43:07.560
Do-soo!

43:07.880 --> 43:09.360
Oh, no.

43:11.360 --> 43:13.640
Do-soo, here.

43:14.600 --> 43:16.880
Do-soo, get a grip.

43:26.120 --> 43:28.480
Do-soo. Do-soo!

43:28.560 --> 43:30.600
What has become of my smart Do-soo

43:30.680 --> 43:32.960
who flipped over in just three months?

43:33.120 --> 43:35.840
Goodness.

43:39.920 --> 43:42.880
It is just like the rumors.
Your skills are impeccable!

43:43.440 --> 43:45.280
Young Master will love it.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.080
Here is the payment.

43:47.320 --> 43:48.960
Thank you.

43:51.400 --> 43:54.560
By any chance, will you not order more?

43:54.880 --> 43:59.200
If you do, I will make a vest for you
while I am at it.

43:59.280 --> 44:00.520
That will be on me.

44:00.880 --> 44:04.000
Then how about a coat for Young Master?

44:04.320 --> 44:06.160
Sure, I will make it in no time.

44:06.560 --> 44:07.800
-Ancestors,
-How beautiful.

44:07.880 --> 44:10.320
-please help Do-soo.
-I do not know how you made this.

44:10.400 --> 44:11.440
Goodness.

44:12.200 --> 44:13.720
Come to think of it,

44:13.800 --> 44:16.880
I ran into a monk in front of this house,

44:17.080 --> 44:19.920
and guess what nonsense he spouted.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
That a son ghost has possessed this place.

44:22.520 --> 44:25.280
He said a son who died with a grudge

44:25.360 --> 44:27.560
is wandering around this area.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.560
But is that not ridiculous?

44:30.640 --> 44:33.280
There is only one Young Master
in this house, no?

44:34.240 --> 44:37.400
Actually, there is a child of a concubine

44:37.480 --> 44:39.760
though nobody knows
if he is dead or alive.

44:40.320 --> 44:41.600
Really?

44:42.040 --> 44:46.920
I remember the monk said
he died in the ocean or whatnot.

44:47.240 --> 44:51.040
As a matter of fact, Young Master
has been tossing and turning in his sleep.

44:51.480 --> 44:52.960
He looks ill during the day,

44:53.040 --> 44:55.600
and he screams
and talks silly during the night.

44:55.680 --> 44:58.960
When I run over to him,
he would have broken into a cold sweat.

44:59.040 --> 45:02.320
Goodness. You should not ignore it.

45:02.400 --> 45:04.480
The third-generation son
of the permission tree house

45:04.560 --> 45:07.440
got possessed by a ghost. He kept
seeing things and did not stop screaming.

45:07.520 --> 45:11.080
He even said
he saw a grim reaper and such.

45:11.840 --> 45:13.520
In the end,
he could not live up to his name

45:13.600 --> 45:16.480
and became a cripple.

45:16.560 --> 45:17.760
Gosh.

45:18.880 --> 45:20.040
Oh, no.

45:20.280 --> 45:22.920
But he recovered with an exorcism.

45:23.000 --> 45:24.920
-An exorcism?
-Yes!

45:25.360 --> 45:27.480
I heard a great shaman

45:27.560 --> 45:29.240
named Bi-ryeong from Ojang-dong

45:29.320 --> 45:30.960
performs an exorcism.

45:32.400 --> 45:35.080
I should get going now.

45:39.280 --> 45:40.600
You there.

45:41.400 --> 45:42.560
Yes, my lord.

45:47.200 --> 45:50.080
Bring over Bi-ryeong from Ojang-dong.

46:08.960 --> 46:11.920
I did not call you over
because I believe in

46:12.000 --> 46:13.520
such wicked exercise.

46:14.000 --> 46:15.800
I simply heard
something disturbing by chance,

46:15.880 --> 46:17.880
so I am just giving it a shot.

46:17.960 --> 46:20.000
If he does not get better,

46:20.400 --> 46:22.240
I will punish you all.

46:22.720 --> 46:23.800
Understood.

46:23.880 --> 46:26.840
And none of you

46:27.120 --> 46:28.880
should say a word

46:28.960 --> 46:31.240
of what is about
to happen today to anyone.

46:33.040 --> 46:34.040
Yes, my lord.

46:36.400 --> 46:37.640
Begin.

47:05.160 --> 47:07.200
Taking lives as a pastime

47:07.600 --> 47:09.960
is what made ghosts haunt you.

47:10.880 --> 47:13.080
You have a wife ghost on each shoulder

47:13.320 --> 47:15.160
and six maiden ghosts on your back.

47:15.240 --> 47:17.040
Not only that,

47:17.120 --> 47:19.640
white spirits, evil spirits,
and a six-eyed turtle

47:19.720 --> 47:22.920
are having a party around your legs
and on top of your head.

47:23.000 --> 47:26.000
Hey now!
How dare you talk to me like that.

47:27.440 --> 47:29.120
Forgive me, Father.

47:29.440 --> 47:33.000
"I did not follow your orders
and made a mistake."

47:37.840 --> 47:41.280
She heard details
of that situation back then.

47:41.440 --> 47:44.880
I heard everything he said from Tae-seo.

47:45.840 --> 47:48.880
Perform exactly as you heard
in front of Park Seung.

47:52.840 --> 47:54.720
What did I tell you, Dad?

47:54.800 --> 47:56.920
I knew Tae-seo could not do it.

48:00.080 --> 48:01.440
You imbecile.

48:01.880 --> 48:04.400
Your incompetence

48:04.480 --> 48:06.640
led to Do-soo getting his hands dirty.

48:07.920 --> 48:11.320
Useless brat. Get out of this house!

48:15.600 --> 48:18.080
Your Highness! Your Royal Highness!

48:19.160 --> 48:21.320
It has been years
since we held your funeral,

48:21.640 --> 48:24.360
so why are you still lingering?

48:27.280 --> 48:29.400
What is holding you back
from resting in peace?

48:29.840 --> 48:33.440
And why are you grasping
his heart like so?

48:34.120 --> 48:35.320
What?

48:35.560 --> 48:36.520
Shut it!

48:37.000 --> 48:40.120
What nonsense are you spewing?

48:45.160 --> 48:46.240
Park Seung.

48:47.960 --> 48:49.240
The one who murdered the Crown Prince.

48:49.880 --> 48:51.280
A traitor to this nation.

49:02.680 --> 49:03.760
Yi-eon!

49:06.600 --> 49:08.960
-Lord Sim.
-You were right.

49:09.360 --> 49:11.280
His Majesty is asking for your injeolmi.

49:13.960 --> 49:15.040
Is that so?

49:15.120 --> 49:17.040
He says

49:17.120 --> 49:19.200
it is the best he has ever had

49:19.280 --> 49:22.160
and has summoned you to the palace.

49:23.160 --> 49:25.800
-Right now?
-Yes, right now.

49:28.920 --> 49:30.080
-Make preparations.
-Yes, my lord.

49:34.960 --> 49:36.240
Would you like a bite?

49:50.000 --> 49:51.680
Please hurry. We are short on time.

49:59.320 --> 50:00.400
Hurry things along.

50:01.880 --> 50:04.840
We will now greet the great spirit.

50:04.920 --> 50:06.800
Your wealth and level of status

50:06.880 --> 50:08.200
are worthless in the great spirit's eyes,

50:08.440 --> 50:10.440
so shed the jewelry and overcoat

50:10.520 --> 50:13.400
you have on!

50:18.000 --> 50:20.640
Right this instant!

50:24.040 --> 50:26.760
Dad, take it off.

50:27.080 --> 50:29.440
Otherwise, I will die.

50:29.840 --> 50:30.920
Dad, please.

50:31.320 --> 50:33.760
-You...
-Pick up the pace.

50:41.040 --> 50:41.920
Take them off.

50:42.920 --> 50:44.240
Take off your socks.

50:50.240 --> 50:52.440
That is what the ghost
has attached itself to.

50:52.640 --> 50:54.440
You will anger the great spirit!

50:54.520 --> 50:56.000
Take them off.

50:56.240 --> 50:57.120
This instant.

50:57.200 --> 50:58.800
Do-soo, no.

50:58.880 --> 51:01.560
You cannot do this.

51:07.040 --> 51:09.880
-But--
-The ritual will now begin,

51:10.040 --> 51:11.960
so keep on bowing.

51:12.120 --> 51:16.080
Stop bowing before I say so,
and you will pay!

51:20.080 --> 51:21.200
But...

51:21.600 --> 51:24.920
Oh, the Spirit.

51:26.800 --> 51:28.880
It is true that they deserve to die,

51:29.160 --> 51:33.920
but please accept their bows

51:34.000 --> 51:36.680
and grant them your forgiveness.

51:37.280 --> 51:38.960
Park Seung and Park Do-soo.

51:39.040 --> 51:41.720
It is true that they deserve to die,

51:42.240 --> 51:44.200
but please accept their bows

51:44.280 --> 51:49.440
and grant them your forgiveness.

51:49.920 --> 51:53.640
You must not stop bowing
before that is asked of you.

51:54.040 --> 51:56.960
Oh, the Spirit.

51:57.680 --> 52:00.600
It is true that they deserve to die,

52:01.000 --> 52:02.600
but please...

52:03.840 --> 52:07.080
Oh, the Spirit!

52:11.120 --> 52:12.920
My lord!

52:13.720 --> 52:16.040
Did you manage to retrieve the letter?

52:16.400 --> 52:18.680
Yes, my lord. It is right here.

52:23.440 --> 52:24.680
[Year of Byeongsul.]

52:24.920 --> 52:31.440
[March 14, Year of Byeongsul]

52:25.000 --> 52:27.680
[In exchange for the involvement
in the Crown Prince's case,]

52:27.920 --> 52:31.800
[Park Seung will receive full authority
over Chungcheong Province.]

52:34.520 --> 52:35.800
What does it say?

52:35.960 --> 52:38.040
In exchange for poisoning
the Crown Prince,

52:38.800 --> 52:41.800
Park Seung received full command
over Chungcheong Province...

52:42.040 --> 52:42.960
from His Majesty.

52:48.120 --> 52:49.720
Are you sure about this?

52:49.920 --> 52:51.720
I may have irrefutable evidence,

52:52.200 --> 52:54.200
but who am I to accuse
the King of this nation?

52:59.720 --> 53:02.880
Just think of a scarecrow and a mole.

53:04.000 --> 53:05.240
A scarecrow and a mole?

53:06.040 --> 53:09.320
Yes. A scarecrow was placed
to chase off moles from a crop field,

53:09.480 --> 53:11.640
but a mole that is not scared by it

53:11.760 --> 53:13.360
fed on the seeds

53:14.040 --> 53:15.880
and also spread disease.

53:16.920 --> 53:18.080
What would be your solution?

53:18.880 --> 53:21.040
I would catch that mole.

53:21.120 --> 53:22.240
Exactly.

53:22.480 --> 53:25.160
Rather than being a scarecrow
that does not serve a purpose,

53:25.440 --> 53:27.240
this is the time to catch the mole.

53:30.520 --> 53:31.600
You are right.

53:31.880 --> 53:33.600
Park Seung will be my primary target.

53:34.200 --> 53:35.280
Absolutely.

53:35.520 --> 53:38.440
He will soon confess to all of his crimes,

53:38.880 --> 53:41.280
-so be there to witness it.
-All right.

53:41.880 --> 53:43.960
I will be back with his arrest warrant.

53:50.080 --> 53:52.280
-My lord.
-Young Master!

53:57.200 --> 53:59.840
Love is shooting from their eyes.
Just plant a kiss on her.

53:59.920 --> 54:01.800
This is not the time
to gaze into her eyes.

54:03.920 --> 54:05.320
You have been summoned by the King.

54:05.560 --> 54:07.480
You are expected by 4 p.m. at the latest.

54:07.560 --> 54:08.640
Of course.

54:09.800 --> 54:11.640
-I will get going then.
-Sure.

54:41.240 --> 54:45.320
[Gwanghwamun]

55:04.320 --> 55:08.320
[Gwanghwamun]

55:14.360 --> 55:17.120
I will now proceed
with the final steps of the exorcism.

55:17.880 --> 55:19.640
You are to confess to your crimes

55:20.000 --> 55:21.520
for the great spirit to hear.

55:24.320 --> 55:26.440
That is the only way
you and your son will live.

55:51.640 --> 55:52.840
Your Majesty,

55:53.640 --> 55:55.720
your injeolmi has arrived.

55:57.360 --> 55:58.960
My injeolmi?

55:59.200 --> 56:00.480
Allow it to enter.

56:10.040 --> 56:12.320
I am Eighth Counselor Ra Yi-eon
of the Office of Special Counselors.

56:12.520 --> 56:15.200
I come bearing
the fresh batch of injeolmi I made.

56:15.880 --> 56:17.640
Lay it out for me to see.

56:18.600 --> 56:19.720
Yes, Your Majesty.

56:26.120 --> 56:28.800
[This is injeolmi with powdered beans.]

56:29.560 --> 56:32.400
[And this is injeolmi with
powdered black sesame seeds.]

56:34.000 --> 56:36.640
[My goodness. Is that mugwort injeolmi?]

56:37.000 --> 56:38.720
[The aroma is making me dizzy.]

56:41.920 --> 56:44.840
Your well-being equals
that of this nation.

56:44.960 --> 56:47.960
It is why I added a herb
that promotes good health.

56:48.080 --> 56:49.880
Aconite, Your Majesty.

56:52.000 --> 56:53.440
Is there a problem?

56:54.000 --> 56:56.640
Aconite, you say? How much did you add?

56:56.800 --> 56:59.560
Was there aconite
in the injeolmi I had before?

56:59.680 --> 57:02.040
Yes, Your Majesty.
I added some in that batch as well.

57:02.880 --> 57:04.920
About one pun, to be exact.

57:23.920 --> 57:26.320
Those are the ingredients
for the Crown Prince's decoction

57:26.560 --> 57:28.160
recorded by his abscess specialist.

57:29.200 --> 57:32.520
As you can see,
six don of aconite was added.

57:33.920 --> 57:36.320
The concentration of aconite
is 60 times higher

57:36.880 --> 57:38.640
than what is in the injeolmi.

57:39.400 --> 57:42.760
The fact that you approved
of such a high concentration of it

57:42.920 --> 57:45.160
must mean it is good for one's health.

57:45.920 --> 57:47.240
It is why I see it as a great honor

57:47.360 --> 57:49.720
to be able to serve you injeolmi

57:49.920 --> 57:51.760
with aconite in it.

57:52.120 --> 57:54.240
So please allow me

57:54.560 --> 57:57.360
to present you
with aconite injeolmi every day.

57:57.680 --> 57:59.160
With aconite?

58:00.040 --> 58:01.240
You see...

58:01.960 --> 58:03.640
I never

58:03.880 --> 58:06.960
vocally approved of a decoction
of that recipe.

58:21.760 --> 58:23.360
[March 14, Year of Byeongsul]

58:26.960 --> 58:29.000
If you did not approve it,

58:29.360 --> 58:31.800
then how could Park Seung have a letter

58:31.960 --> 58:34.160
that states otherwise
stamped with your seal?

58:35.120 --> 58:36.800
That is because...

58:38.000 --> 58:39.600
I did not give permission.

58:40.960 --> 58:44.120
Threatened by
the Crown Prince's brightness and wisdom,

58:44.360 --> 58:46.400
Park Seung blackmailed me.

58:48.600 --> 58:52.040
You were not a heartless father
who was jealous of his own son?

58:58.240 --> 59:01.440
Your Majesty,
you are our leader and father figure.

59:01.640 --> 59:03.680
How could the Father of the people

59:03.880 --> 59:06.440
turn against his own son
in the face of power?

59:07.000 --> 59:09.120
You do not fear the skies.

59:09.200 --> 59:11.400
So why would the skies
look on you with favor?

59:11.760 --> 59:14.920
I put my life on the line
to dare ask Your Majesty this question.

59:15.720 --> 59:18.720
Did Your Majesty
use Park Seung as a shield?

59:18.800 --> 59:21.800
Or did Park Seung turn you into a puppet?

59:28.480 --> 59:31.960
If you feel any remorse
about the passing of the Crown Prince,

59:32.600 --> 59:34.760
please give me
the right to arrest Park Seung,

59:34.840 --> 59:36.640
so he can finally receive
the punishment he deserves,

59:36.720 --> 59:38.680
and please also strip him of the right

59:38.760 --> 59:40.400
to govern Ganghwa Island!

59:46.240 --> 59:49.160
Or I could bestow you

59:49.680 --> 59:51.640
with a grand title.

59:55.320 --> 59:56.680
How about Chief State Councilor?

1:00:03.200 --> 1:00:04.600
What I want

1:00:05.920 --> 1:00:07.400
is a fair judgment.

1:00:08.120 --> 1:00:09.960
I do not want unjust power.

1:00:10.360 --> 1:00:13.800
Your Majesty,
I implore you to heed my sincere advice.

1:00:14.200 --> 1:00:16.560
During my tenure
as a secret royal inspector,

1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:19.760
I saw the people suffer
under malicious rulers.

1:00:20.280 --> 1:00:23.920
I beg you. Please thoroughly investigate
all the ministers and officers

1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:25.840
so that we can uphold order
and prevent corruption.

1:00:25.920 --> 1:00:28.920
And please care for the struggling people.

1:00:29.560 --> 1:00:31.920
Instead of treating them poorly
because they are of low birth,

1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:34.080
hire them and make use of their talents.

1:00:34.440 --> 1:00:36.920
Abolish all the outdated customs
that discriminate against the powerless

1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:38.640
and oppress women and children

1:00:39.680 --> 1:00:42.560
and give your people hope.

1:00:53.040 --> 1:00:55.360
I will give you the right
to govern Ganghwa Island

1:00:57.560 --> 1:00:59.760
and issue the arrest warrant
on Park Seung.

1:01:02.200 --> 1:01:04.440
Now, you may leave.

1:02:11.120 --> 1:02:14.080
Will you come to your senses
only after your son dies?

1:02:29.840 --> 1:02:32.240
My father...

1:02:36.280 --> 1:02:39.840
He had Tae-seo steal all the tributes
that were meant for the King.

1:02:39.920 --> 1:02:41.120
Do-soo.

1:02:41.200 --> 1:02:42.720
And to cover that up,

1:02:42.800 --> 1:02:45.680
-he had the secret inspectors killed!
-My goodness.

1:02:45.920 --> 1:02:48.720
-He threatened the abscess specialist
-You fool.

1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:50.680
and made him put...

1:02:50.760 --> 1:02:54.000
You fool, pull yourself together.
What are you doing?

1:02:54.360 --> 1:02:56.200
He made him put aconite
in the herbal decoction

1:02:56.280 --> 1:02:59.360
to worsen the Crown Prince's condition.

1:02:59.440 --> 1:03:03.160
And I was the one who took
the final bowl of poison...

1:03:04.200 --> 1:03:07.360
I was the one who took it
to the Crown Prince.

1:03:09.560 --> 1:03:13.800
Forgive me. I am truly sorry.

1:03:13.880 --> 1:03:16.800
Please forgive me. I was wrong.

1:03:16.880 --> 1:03:19.000
I am so sorry. Please...

1:03:19.080 --> 1:03:20.920
-Receive the royal command!
-What?

1:03:38.960 --> 1:03:41.040
I am sorry.

1:03:41.760 --> 1:03:44.240
I am truly sorry. Forgive me.

1:03:45.120 --> 1:03:47.880
Did you all hear him confess?

1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:49.160
-Yes, my lord!
-Yes, my lord!

1:03:55.280 --> 1:03:58.400
Park Seung and Park Do-soo.
You criminals are to be tied up!

1:04:01.080 --> 1:04:02.400
Let go of me, you fools!

1:04:02.480 --> 1:04:05.280
How dare you lowlifes
put your hands on me!

1:04:05.800 --> 1:04:06.840
Let go!

1:05:29.640 --> 1:05:31.200
[We thank Jo Kwan-woo
for his special appearance.]

1:05:31.720 --> 1:05:34.400
[Secret Royal Inspector Joy]

1:05:35.040 --> 1:05:37.400
[You will live a life
that is worse than death.]

1:05:37.760 --> 1:05:40.320
[He will not take office or wed.]

1:05:40.400 --> 1:05:41.880
[Have you truly lost your mind?]

1:05:42.200 --> 1:05:44.240
[-Found it!
-Where is it?]

1:05:44.560 --> 1:05:46.240
[Do you think I can do a good job?]

1:05:46.440 --> 1:05:49.120
[What is there to be afraid of
when you have me right by your side?]

1:05:49.360 --> 1:05:51.840
[The Spirit says
you two will live happily ever after.]

1:05:51.920 --> 1:05:54.960
[Yoo Deok-bong wishes
Kim Jo-yi all the best.]

1:05:55.200 --> 1:05:58.400
[This will be our new home.]

1:05:58.600 --> 1:06:00.840
[My dream was to be happy.]

1:06:00.920 --> 1:06:02.320
[Now, I am happy.]
