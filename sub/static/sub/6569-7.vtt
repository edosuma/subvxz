00:20.020 --> 00:21.522
<i>Kyle, we need to
blow up the Veep's visit</i>

00:21.622 --> 00:22.692
to the British pub, okay?

00:22.789 --> 00:25.065
We are running some reverse
<i>My Fair Lady</i> shit here.

00:25.292 --> 00:26.532
We're showing she's a regular gal.

00:26.627 --> 00:27.799
Mark, the memorial.

00:28.295 --> 00:30.297
We need a ton of coverage.

00:30.364 --> 00:32.037
<i>It's 100 years from World War I,</i>

00:32.131 --> 00:33.975
<i>Selina's back in black, she's looking good,</i>

00:34.034 --> 00:36.378
<i>and it's "Good Mourning, America"
mourning with a "u."</i>

00:37.070 --> 00:39.141
Sue.

00:39.206 --> 00:42.210
I need you to get Selina
a meeting with Prince Charles,

00:42.309 --> 00:43.879
that 65-year-old fuckin' intern. Okay?

00:44.478 --> 00:46.719
Dan, if you want to get
into the palace at short notice,

00:46.813 --> 00:49.054
you're going to have to storm it yourself!

00:49.383 --> 00:52.057
Okay, Sue, listen.
This is me, campaign manager,

00:52.152 --> 00:55.429
<i>telling you, schedule woman, to just,
you know, make that happen.</i>

00:55.589 --> 00:56.567
All right, all right.

00:56.657 --> 01:00.434
Someone get me the Prince of Wales'
private secretary on the phone, stat.

01:00.527 --> 01:03.201
Tough call. Then again, you're a tough caller.

01:04.864 --> 01:06.902
<i>Wonderful, wonderful.</i>

01:07.000 --> 01:09.002
Hey. Listen. I am thrilled to be here

01:09.069 --> 01:10.548
looking presidential, of course.

01:10.604 --> 01:12.447
But what about POTUS?
Is there any more news from him?

01:12.539 --> 01:15.247
No, he definitely wanted to come.
He had to stay and close the China deal.

01:15.342 --> 01:17.049
He had tickets for a West End musical.

01:17.110 --> 01:20.091
Something with a duck or a ghost.
I don't remember.

01:20.180 --> 01:21.921
Hey, is FLOTUS having an affair?

01:22.015 --> 01:24.086
- Not that I would blame her.
- Have you seen her lately?

01:24.184 --> 01:25.925
- She's lost a lot of weight.
- A lot, right?

01:26.086 --> 01:28.088
Her neck is like stretched cheese.

01:28.188 --> 01:29.223
- Yeah, it looks bad now.
- Right?

01:29.289 --> 01:30.359
- Bad.
- It's gone bad.

01:30.457 --> 01:33.028
Hello again, Mr. Ambassador.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.094
And you know

01:34.194 --> 01:36.105
Peter Mitchell, Deputy Prime Minister?

01:36.363 --> 01:37.706
Yeah, we met in Hong Kong.

01:37.864 --> 01:39.707
Heroin and Chinese food.

01:39.766 --> 01:41.109
Noodles and needles.

01:42.035 --> 01:43.036
It was actually

01:43.103 --> 01:45.413
the solar energy summit in Stockholm.

01:45.472 --> 01:47.281
That's the one, that's the one. Same vibe.

01:48.542 --> 01:51.455
100 years since the Great War
is so my area, Amy.

01:51.545 --> 01:53.081
How does this sound? "In four years,

01:53.146 --> 01:54.819
"16 million perished.

01:54.915 --> 01:56.826
"In the silent aftermath,

01:56.917 --> 01:59.295
"towns grieved for their fallen young men."

01:59.386 --> 02:00.558
This is my masterpiece.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.965
I mean, I'm nailing pathos
to the fricking wall here.

02:03.056 --> 02:06.833
Death, glory, folly, tragedy.
It's got the four main mood groups.

02:06.927 --> 02:07.962
So have you set up the secret

02:08.061 --> 02:10.166
Transatlantic Security Organization meeting

02:10.263 --> 02:12.300
- with the German chancellor?
Mmm-hmm. At the cathedral.

02:12.599 --> 02:14.476
She can lie to the Brits
and go straight to confession.

02:15.068 --> 02:17.446
The Brits are gonna be unhappier.

02:17.771 --> 02:19.512
I need a stiff fuckin' drink.

02:19.740 --> 02:22.152
In related news, Ray's talking.

02:22.242 --> 02:23.744
- Oh, God. To smart people?
- Yeah.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.949
He's currently with a woman
from the Bank of England.

02:26.013 --> 02:28.289
It's like watching a goat trying to use an ATM.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.985
You know, because money is just a concept.

02:31.084 --> 02:33.690
You know, we believe in it
because we're too scared not to.

02:33.787 --> 02:35.425
There's no intrinsic value to it.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.264
- It's not like muscles in your arms.
- Well...

02:37.357 --> 02:40.099
Okay, I think that's
quite a superficial analysis.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.332
You know what "intrinsic" means?

02:41.828 --> 02:43.865
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I try to learn a word a day.

02:44.431 --> 02:46.536
I love words very ardently.

02:47.601 --> 02:50.104
Yeah. Sorry, who are you again?

02:50.370 --> 02:52.213
The Transatlantic Security Organization

02:52.305 --> 02:54.785
that's going to Frankfurt and not here?
Because...

02:54.941 --> 02:57.615
Honestly, we haven't made a decision
about that yet.

02:57.678 --> 03:00.318
Right. And I hope that "honestly"

03:00.380 --> 03:03.327
isn't one of those words that's lost
its meaning whilst traveling the Atlantic.

03:04.718 --> 03:07.494
What about the censure vote
in the House of Commons tomorrow?

03:07.554 --> 03:08.658
How do you think that's gonna go?

03:08.722 --> 03:10.292
- On spying?
- Mmm-hmm.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.495
- It'll be defeated.
- Oh, good.

03:12.559 --> 03:14.004
But then you probably know that already.

03:15.862 --> 03:17.808
I'm relieved to hear that. I really am.

03:17.864 --> 03:20.367
You know, 'cause the U.S.
doesn't spy on its allies.

03:20.467 --> 03:22.538
- Now I'm relieved.
- We collect data.

03:22.636 --> 03:24.081
- Same thing.
- Oh. No.

03:24.171 --> 03:25.878
No? Gary, what do you think?

03:28.475 --> 03:29.419
Well, I...

03:29.509 --> 03:32.012
Gary likes to keep his cards
close to his chest.

03:32.145 --> 03:33.215
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

03:33.313 --> 03:34.883
No, please, do share.

03:34.981 --> 03:36.756
I'm just "collecting data."

03:36.883 --> 03:38.260
Yeah.

03:41.188 --> 03:43.225
Um, I think it's very nuanced.

03:43.323 --> 03:46.065
And I think there's a lot of different sides

03:46.159 --> 03:49.538
to a lot of different topics that are out there

03:49.596 --> 03:50.904
that I think we could...

03:50.997 --> 03:52.738
Gary, I need that lipstick.

03:52.833 --> 03:54.676
- Thank you so much.
- Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

03:55.502 --> 03:57.072
Madam out there hobnobbing...

03:57.170 --> 03:58.581
...us here in the servants' quarters.

03:58.672 --> 03:59.742
It's like <i>Downton Abbey.</i>

04:00.173 --> 04:02.278
"McClintock, Lady Selina wishes to eat

04:02.375 --> 04:04.377
"a Cornish pasty in the paddock this evening.

04:04.444 --> 04:05.616
"Post-haste, you bugger!"

04:06.046 --> 04:07.252
I love that voice.

04:07.347 --> 04:09.588
It makes me feel inadequate and horny.
The dream.

04:11.218 --> 04:13.892
Ray, I don't know if you've met
the Deputy Prime Minister.

04:14.221 --> 04:15.256
- Ray Whelans.
- Pleasure.

04:15.355 --> 04:16.891
- Wellness consultant.
- Wellness?

04:17.224 --> 04:19.795
Oh, like a fitness chap?

04:20.026 --> 04:22.597
- I'm also a businessman and an author.
- An author?

04:22.696 --> 04:23.970
Would I know any of your titles?

04:24.064 --> 04:26.305
"60-Day Shred."

04:26.399 --> 04:29.107
"Get A Bod Like God,"

04:29.202 --> 04:31.113
"My Name Is Ray, You're Okay,"

04:31.204 --> 04:32.945
"The Greater Glory In 20 Days"...

04:33.039 --> 04:35.110
Ray, I need Gary.

04:35.208 --> 04:36.585
- Okay.
- Yeah.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.155
Yes, I've seen the numbers, Kent.

04:38.245 --> 04:39.986
I know that she's bleeding blue collars.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.491
So we're gonna make her
look fucking folksy in a London pub.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.263
Wasn't it Oscar Wilde who said,

04:45.318 --> 04:47.628
"Dan's a fucking terrible campaign manager“?

04:47.721 --> 04:50.634
I would like to shoot him,
but there are no guns in this country.

04:50.724 --> 04:51.828
Yeah.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.474
Steven, this is Jonah Ryan
reporting to Team Maddox.

05:00.233 --> 05:01.439
I'm in London Town,

05:01.501 --> 05:03.913
and it's going to be a
"right royal cockney barrel of turnips"

05:03.970 --> 05:06.814
when I dish the dirt on Selina Meyer.

05:07.574 --> 05:09.281
Yes, sir,
I'll stop using the accent.

05:09.342 --> 05:10.514
Hello, Jonah.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.125
Hello, sir.

05:14.181 --> 05:16.457
Just buying some tickets
for Madame Tussauds.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.156
You're an imbecile.

05:21.688 --> 05:24.100
What a charming little pub.

05:24.357 --> 05:27.531
I have to say,
this is just the most delightful place.

05:27.627 --> 05:30.608
I can imagine Harry Potter
getting loaded in here.

05:30.764 --> 05:32.607
Right, yes. Although, well...

05:33.333 --> 05:34.505
Well, he's a small child,

05:34.601 --> 05:36.012
so, underage. But...

05:36.102 --> 05:37.547
Oh, right. Yes, of course. Of course.

05:37.637 --> 05:40.880
Although I think the actor
is quite a grown man.

05:40.974 --> 05:43.386
The actor, yes.
But the original, the literary version,

05:43.476 --> 05:45.820
which, of course,
is the fictional story of a child witch.

05:45.879 --> 05:48.621
So, would very much
still be considered a minor.

05:49.049 --> 05:51.029
Right. Actually, I think it's a wizard.

05:51.117 --> 05:52.653
- Yeah.
- Yeah, right.

05:53.286 --> 05:54.287
Same.

05:54.354 --> 05:55.992
So, you are the owner of the pub?

05:56.056 --> 05:57.797
Amy, the "emu“ has landed.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.030
Jonah's in London.

05:59.125 --> 06:00.627
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

06:00.694 --> 06:02.037
<i>Maddox must have sent him here</i>

06:02.128 --> 06:04.506
to spy or something. Ha.

06:04.564 --> 06:06.805
"Jonah Bond, double-o-fuck off."

06:06.867 --> 06:08.005
I'll see you at the press conference.

06:08.068 --> 06:09.046
What?

06:09.135 --> 06:10.239
I'm also here.

06:10.637 --> 06:12.048
Have you been here a long time?

06:12.138 --> 06:14.379
Oh, I've been running this gaff for 25 years.

06:14.474 --> 06:16.181
- I've lived around here me whole life.
- I see.

06:16.243 --> 06:17.654
Born and bred West Ham fan.

06:18.645 --> 06:21.216
What kind of ham did you say?

06:21.314 --> 06:22.759
West Ham United.

06:22.849 --> 06:24.328
They're my local team.

06:24.651 --> 06:25.595
- Football.
- Oh!

06:25.685 --> 06:27.164
Of course, football. Right.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.029
We call that soccer, actually.

06:29.089 --> 06:30.193
No, here, football.

06:30.690 --> 06:32.328
Right. We have football there.

06:32.392 --> 06:35.168
And I'm wondering actually
what do you call, what we call soccer?

06:35.228 --> 06:36.502
That's one thing I don't...

06:36.563 --> 06:38.600
- Yeah. Football.
- Right. Great.

06:38.698 --> 06:40.541
So, uh, what are you having, ma'am?

06:40.600 --> 06:42.011
Uh-huh. What am I having?

06:42.068 --> 06:44.514
What would you recommend
that I have at this lovely place?

06:44.604 --> 06:46.914
Oh.
Uh, how about a nice pinot noir?

06:47.007 --> 06:48.577
Oh, that sounds divine.

06:48.675 --> 06:51.053
I'm joking. No, that's... He won't...

06:51.344 --> 06:52.584
I think to me, you look like

06:52.679 --> 06:53.953
a bitter person,

06:54.047 --> 06:55.390
maybe.

06:56.216 --> 06:58.287
Which is a type of beer. Don't worry.

06:58.385 --> 06:59.386
It's just a joke.

06:59.452 --> 07:00.931
Just playing.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.261
Bitter is a horrible beer.

07:02.355 --> 07:04.528
Well, she's gonna drink it
and she's gonna smile, Gary.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.764
- Okay, I've got some peppermints.
- I've got digestive enzymes.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.703
Do you want me to just put that in my bag?
Oh, okay.

07:09.296 --> 07:10.570
So would you like to do the honors, ma'am?

07:10.697 --> 07:12.370
- I'm not sure...
- Pulling a pint?

07:12.432 --> 07:14.412
- Yes, yes.
- Yes, I would. I'd absolutely love to do that.

07:14.467 --> 07:15.946
Well, stroll on down and I'll show you how.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.106
Okay, gang, if you guys want to...

07:17.203 --> 07:20.878
All right, guys. The Vice President
is now going to "pull a pint."

07:20.941 --> 07:22.784
- I just said that. I just said that.
- Come on down.

07:23.043 --> 07:25.546
Yen, yep. Ooh.

07:25.712 --> 07:27.282
Okay. Well, cheers.

07:27.380 --> 07:28.882
- Cheers. Cheers.
- Cheers.

07:30.884 --> 07:31.988
That's lovely.

07:38.758 --> 07:39.793
Hey!

07:40.327 --> 07:42.671
Bottoms up, ma'am!
Get it down you' Selina.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.139
Down in one, sweetheart.

07:44.230 --> 07:45.334
What? What did you say?

07:45.432 --> 07:47.173
- Down in one.
- "Daniwah!" Okay!

07:47.267 --> 07:48.473
- "Daniwah!"
- "Daniwah!"

07:50.804 --> 07:51.805
Daniwah!

07:51.905 --> 07:53.612
- Daniwah!
- Daniwah!

07:54.641 --> 07:57.087
They're eating this up.
I think we just landed a catchphrase.

07:57.143 --> 07:58.451
They're not saying "Daniwah."

07:58.511 --> 08:00.582
They're saying "down in one."

08:00.647 --> 08:01.853
Moron.

08:03.850 --> 08:05.090
Daniwah!

08:06.286 --> 08:08.027
- Make her stop saying that.
- Yeah.

08:08.121 --> 08:10.658
They're laughing at her like a toddler
they taught to swear.

08:10.757 --> 08:12.293
Okay, ma'am. Are you feeling okay?

08:12.359 --> 08:14.134
- No.
- Yeah, you a little gassy?

08:14.461 --> 08:15.769
Oh, yeah. Like the Hindenburg.

08:15.829 --> 08:16.830
I think we're good. I think we're good.

08:16.930 --> 08:18.273
- Let's get out of here.
- Okay.

08:18.331 --> 08:19.605
Thank you guys very much for coming out.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.009
- We really appreciate it.
- Daniwah, guys!

08:21.101 --> 08:22.603
"Daniwah!"
Daniwah!

08:26.706 --> 08:28.652
Okay, "Daniwah" is trending.

08:28.775 --> 08:30.982
It's number two under
Kate Middleton's bony ass.

08:31.044 --> 08:33.683
You know, I thought it was some sort of
a Japanese thing that he was saying.

08:33.780 --> 08:35.123
Yeah, like <i>konnichiwa.</i>

08:35.181 --> 08:36.182
Hey, ma'am, I ordered

08:36.282 --> 08:38.057
a pot of hot tea for your room.

08:38.284 --> 08:41.322
I'm not having anything else
to drink for the next month.

08:42.121 --> 08:46.730
Siri, how many horses died
in the First World War?

08:46.826 --> 08:48.362
Why are you asking that?

08:48.461 --> 08:49.496
For the speech.

08:49.562 --> 08:51.701
No. I'm not talking about horses.

08:51.798 --> 08:54.142
Cancel search, Siri.

08:55.368 --> 08:59.009
<i>You're gonna look so stunning
at the war service, ma 'am.</i>

08:59.072 --> 09:00.915
<i>Those guys are
gonna wish they weren't dead.</i>

09:02.542 --> 09:03.987
<i>All right.</i>

09:04.044 --> 09:05.853
Here's the cherry on top of the most

09:05.912 --> 09:08.518
delicious sundae, I must say.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.493
Look how beautiful that is.

09:12.552 --> 09:13.553
Mmm...

09:13.753 --> 09:15.027
What?

09:15.088 --> 09:16.328
What, do you think the bigger one?

09:16.656 --> 09:19.193
Don't you think the other hat
is a little too "natty"?

09:19.325 --> 09:20.326
I don't know. What do you think?

09:20.393 --> 09:21.394
I think it's London.

09:21.494 --> 09:23.201
Britain is the kingdom of the hats.

09:23.496 --> 09:25.066
I have never heard that phrase.

09:25.432 --> 09:26.570
It's a well-known phrase.

09:26.666 --> 09:27.667
Is it?

09:29.035 --> 09:30.412
Yeah.

09:30.503 --> 09:32.380
I agree with you.
I'm gonna go with the other one.

09:32.439 --> 09:34.214
I'm gonna go with the other one.
Yeah, why not?

09:34.274 --> 09:36.185
Maybe I can wear this with something else.

09:36.276 --> 09:37.846
I don't know what else I brought.

09:37.944 --> 09:39.184
Or nothing at all.

09:39.512 --> 09:41.924
- Ooh, what?
- What?

09:42.015 --> 09:43.858
I don't know what you mean.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.954
- Do you know what that means?
- Oh, dear.

09:46.052 --> 09:47.531
I don't think we have
time for this, do we?

09:47.587 --> 09:48.861
What, horsing around?

09:48.922 --> 09:50.629
Look at these branches.

09:50.723 --> 09:52.430
It is springtime in here.

09:52.692 --> 09:54.865
- Gary, close the door behind you.
- Sure. Yeah.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.532
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

09:56.963 --> 09:58.442
All right, guys, I need a plan here. Okay?

09:59.866 --> 10:01.436
I am "Dan With A Plan" Egan,

10:01.534 --> 10:03.275
so if I can't work, then you can't work, and...

10:03.369 --> 10:05.280
Call him back.
We've got to go in there and talk to Selina.

10:05.371 --> 10:06.543
I'm just, urn...

10:06.606 --> 10:08.586
I was just doing a little role-playing.

10:09.542 --> 10:10.919
Like a Charles Manson defense?

10:11.778 --> 10:12.779
Ah...

10:13.780 --> 10:15.817
- Front of the Standard.
- Oh.

10:15.915 --> 10:17.656
You've even managed
to get yourself in there.

10:17.750 --> 10:19.229
Nicely done, "Obi-Wah Kenobi."

10:20.220 --> 10:21.460
No one reads that rag.

10:21.554 --> 10:22.794
That's one paper.

10:22.889 --> 10:24.300
I can handle one paper, guys.

10:24.390 --> 10:25.630
And you know this about me. All right?

10:25.725 --> 10:26.965
I can chop this thing in two

10:27.060 --> 10:28.664
- like a disputed kitten.
- Oh, pleasant.

10:28.995 --> 10:29.973
- Mike?
- Yes, ma'am.

10:30.063 --> 10:31.974
I want to talk to you about this speech

10:32.065 --> 10:33.840
for the World War I service, okay?

10:33.933 --> 10:37.176
Very proud of it, ma'am.
I gave this one 100% effort.

10:37.670 --> 10:39.513
As I do everything I write for you.

10:39.606 --> 10:41.586
Okay, I'm not sure about this...
Uh...

10:41.808 --> 10:43.151
"To honor all who

10:43.243 --> 10:46.190
"fell in frozen Flanders fields

10:46.279 --> 10:48.156
"and hold their memory fresh."

10:49.282 --> 10:51.091
- It's just a little bit too "effy" for me.
- Yeah.

10:51.317 --> 10:53.024
- Do you know?
- Well, that's kind of the idea, ma'am.

10:53.119 --> 10:54.325
I mean, it's poetic.

10:54.420 --> 10:55.660
Yeah, but we're trying to appeal

10:55.755 --> 10:58.361
to the blue-collar demographic, right?
Not the poets.

10:58.458 --> 10:59.937
- I agree.
- Ray agrees.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.473
So, "16 million perished."

11:02.529 --> 11:04.805
No, well they didn't.
They died, so just say that.

11:04.864 --> 11:07.538
"The loss, though impossible
to adequately comprehend..."

11:07.634 --> 11:09.773
That sentence is impossible to comprehend.

11:09.836 --> 11:11.713
Just say, "hard to understand," you know?

11:11.804 --> 11:13.283
Plain English.

11:13.339 --> 11:15.114
- I kind of agree.
- Mmm.

11:15.275 --> 11:16.618
I could normalfy this for you.

11:16.709 --> 11:17.847
No. No, no.

11:17.944 --> 11:19.514
No, no, no. Just listen. Just listen.

11:19.612 --> 11:21.683
He's got sort of a working-class touch,

11:21.781 --> 11:23.158
which is something that's valuable,

11:23.216 --> 11:24.718
and we should listen to it.

11:24.817 --> 11:27.696
I printed a copy of
the speech from the "G" folder.

11:27.787 --> 11:29.528
Why does he have access to the "G" folder?

11:29.622 --> 11:31.363
I don't even have access to the "G" folder.

11:31.457 --> 11:32.527
Yes, you do, Mike. We all do.

11:32.959 --> 11:34.529
It's the general file on the iCloud.

11:34.627 --> 11:36.868
Everything was much easier
when it was just floppy discs.

11:36.963 --> 11:38.965
To paraphrase My Fair Lady,

11:39.032 --> 11:41.137
we need to get to the fuckin' church on time.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.202
One second. So, Mike,

11:42.302 --> 11:43.975
what's your favorite part of this speech?

11:44.037 --> 11:45.141
Okay. This is like Gettysburg.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.412
"Beneath the..."

11:49.876 --> 11:51.514
"Beneath the dark soil of Passchendaele,

11:51.578 --> 11:53.489
"100,000 bodies still lie

11:53.546 --> 11:54.991
"unaccounted for.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.324
"Let today be their funeral service

11:57.383 --> 11:59.192
"and we their mourners."

11:59.352 --> 12:01.195
How about this?

12:01.254 --> 12:04.326
"There's a whole lotta guys
who never came home.

12:04.490 --> 12:06.231
"Good guys.

12:06.326 --> 12:07.930
"Here's to those guys."

12:08.561 --> 12:10.063
Holy fuckin' Christ.

12:10.163 --> 12:11.699
- What is that, Ray?
- I'm just spitballin'.

12:11.764 --> 12:13.243
No, Ray, listen, listen.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.745
I've gotta stick with Mike's words,
you understand?

12:15.835 --> 12:17.246
- Totally.
- Because it's appropriate.

12:17.337 --> 12:18.441
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Ame?

12:18.538 --> 12:19.539
- Yes?
- What's happening with

12:19.606 --> 12:20.914
the German chancellor?

12:21.007 --> 12:23.453
After the speech, you're gonna
meet with him in the side chapel

12:23.543 --> 12:24.954
and tell him that POTUS guarantees

12:25.044 --> 12:26.887
the TSO will be in Frankfurt, not London.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.184
Hey, I'm gonna make a phone call

12:28.248 --> 12:29.750
- about that right now.
- Okay.

12:30.216 --> 12:31.388
Uh, where is Gary?

12:32.352 --> 12:33.422
I'm right here.

12:34.220 --> 12:36.029
What? Were you there the whole time?

12:36.289 --> 12:37.962
Yeah, yeah.

12:40.627 --> 12:41.605
Jonah Ryan, Maddox Team.

12:41.694 --> 12:43.970
<i>Is this "Ryantology" Jonah Ryan?</i>

12:44.063 --> 12:45.303
Yeah, one and the same.

12:45.398 --> 12:46.604
I'm a big fan of your website.

12:46.699 --> 12:47.643
<i>Well, thank you.</i>

12:47.734 --> 12:49.042
Actually, I don't run it anymore.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.376
<i>Oh, what a shame.</i>

12:50.436 --> 12:52.712
I was going to give you a story
about Ray Whelans,

12:52.772 --> 12:54.115
<i>Selina Meyer's trainer?</i>

12:54.207 --> 12:55.311
You know, I do still run it.

12:55.408 --> 12:57.479
I was just looking at
one of my feeds right now.

12:57.577 --> 12:59.215
Well, prepare to be astonished.

12:59.312 --> 13:01.258
I'm ready for anything with that accent.

13:02.749 --> 13:04.990
I can! believe Ray tried to edit my speech.

13:05.084 --> 13:07.655
I feel like Shakespeare
when that monkey tried to make fun of him.

13:07.754 --> 13:08.994
What?

13:09.088 --> 13:10.897
I think that might have been a cartoon.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.436
All right, let's get on
with the remembering thing,

13:12.558 --> 13:13.901
and I'll finesse the speech in the car.

13:14.727 --> 13:15.728
- Anne?
- Yeah?

13:15.828 --> 13:18.138
I know Ray was a little off on the speech,

13:18.231 --> 13:20.142
but wait till you see the hat he chose.

13:26.906 --> 13:29.113
"In four fateful years,

13:29.175 --> 13:32.315
"16 million perished.

13:33.513 --> 13:34.958
"This loss,

13:35.014 --> 13:38.120
"though impossible to
adequately comprehend..."

13:38.184 --> 13:40.130
This speech is so beautiful.

13:40.186 --> 13:42.132
So beautiful.

13:42.188 --> 13:46.034
"Beneath the dark soil of Passchendaele..."

13:46.859 --> 13:49.931
Right after this, Selina has to go
straight to meet the German chancellor.

13:49.996 --> 13:52.340
I'll hold off that long streak of deputy piss

13:52.432 --> 13:53.638
while she's in there.

13:53.700 --> 13:55.270
"...and we their mourners."

13:56.436 --> 13:59.815
Let's remember the guys
who never came home.

14:01.107 --> 14:02.950
Here's to the good guys.

14:04.877 --> 14:07.050
Boy, they were good guys, weren't they?

14:07.146 --> 14:08.523
They were.

14:11.317 --> 14:13.297
- You all right, mate?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

14:13.953 --> 14:15.023
Lost your car?

14:15.121 --> 14:17.692
No, no, no. I'm waiting on a guy.

14:18.191 --> 14:19.226
Oh, right.

14:19.559 --> 14:20.902
No. I...

14:20.993 --> 14:23.030
I'm not waiting on a guy to have sex with.

14:23.129 --> 14:25.006
I am waiting on a guy to talk... He's a reporter.

14:25.064 --> 14:26.065
Is he?

14:26.165 --> 14:28.577
Look, you wouldn't get it.
Your jacket is fluorescent.

14:28.668 --> 14:30.545
- Oh, I get it, sir.
- Really? You do?

14:32.839 --> 14:34.580
Jonah Ryan, Maddox Team.

14:34.674 --> 14:36.711
<i>This is Rob from the Daily Mirror.
You've got a story?</i>

14:36.809 --> 14:38.015
Hey, where are you?

14:38.077 --> 14:40.182
<i>Why do you want to meet
in a fucking car park?</i>

14:40.246 --> 14:41.384
I don't know, I just thought

14:41.481 --> 14:42.824
"Watergate, Deep Throat."

14:42.882 --> 14:44.862
No. You son of a...

14:44.984 --> 14:46.486
<i>Look, let's just meet in a pub.</i>

14:47.687 --> 14:49.223
How about a coffee?

14:51.491 --> 14:53.903
Eight pounds for two coffees?
Thank you, America.

14:54.160 --> 14:56.037
I could get four pints of Ruddles for that.

14:56.095 --> 14:57.199
Okay,

14:57.263 --> 14:58.571
check this out.

14:58.664 --> 15:01.736
The Vice President
is fucking her personal trainer.

15:02.702 --> 15:04.010
Ooh.

15:05.938 --> 15:07.008
No. Not really interested.

15:07.073 --> 15:08.245
Is this all you have?

15:08.341 --> 15:11.083
No, I've got a super hot
British source with a super sexy voice.

15:11.177 --> 15:12.884
She sounds like Mary Poppins on all fours.

15:13.112 --> 15:15.422
You do realize Mary Poppins
would be over 100 by now?

15:15.515 --> 15:17.222
Yeah, and I'd love to sweep her chimney.

15:17.283 --> 15:18.284
You know what I mean?

15:19.018 --> 15:20.725
No. Shall we just go to the pub?

15:20.787 --> 15:22.095
There's one over there,
they'll do a shit coffee.

15:22.188 --> 15:23.690
No, no, no. See, here's the thing.

15:23.756 --> 15:26.134
This guy Ray,
he had a blog a couple of years ago, right?

15:26.359 --> 15:27.429
But it got deleted.

15:27.527 --> 15:28.801
So I did some research...

15:28.895 --> 15:31.034
- So you googled it.
- No, I didn't just google it.

15:31.097 --> 15:33.270
I found this thing called
the "Internet Archive"...

15:33.366 --> 15:34.572
So you googled it.

15:34.634 --> 15:36.477
I googled "Internet Archive," yes,
and I found it there.

15:37.136 --> 15:38.774
- But, on the Internet Archive.
- Yeah.

15:38.871 --> 15:41.750
- I found screen grabs of his old blog, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

15:41.808 --> 15:43.583
What Ray said was, and I quote,

15:43.876 --> 15:47.221
"Obesity is a punishment for sins
committed in a previous life.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.290
"Fat people have to learn self-discipline

15:49.649 --> 15:53.119
"until they are rid of the demon
that lives within them.“

15:53.886 --> 15:54.887
- Oh, hello.
- Yeah.

15:55.555 --> 15:56.898
What do you have to say about that?

15:57.390 --> 15:58.334
"Daniwah!"

15:58.424 --> 15:59.630
Excuse me one second.

15:59.725 --> 16:01.830
- Ben.
- Peter. Great service.

16:01.928 --> 16:03.737
Yes, it was very moving.

16:04.230 --> 16:08.406
I thought the Vice President's speech
was quite excellent.

16:08.634 --> 16:11.137
You don't happen to know her whereabouts,
do you?

16:11.471 --> 16:13.678
She's on the phone. State Department.

16:14.073 --> 16:15.279
Right.

16:15.608 --> 16:18.987
I saw the German chancellor just now heading

16:19.078 --> 16:20.853
toward the Lady Chapel.

16:22.982 --> 16:23.983
Yeah.

16:24.083 --> 16:27.326
Um. He was going in there to pray privately.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.525
I overheard him speaking to one of his aides.

16:29.755 --> 16:30.756
Oh.

16:31.290 --> 16:32.928
You overheard. You speak German?

16:33.759 --> 16:34.829
Yes.

16:34.927 --> 16:37.533
<i>Ja</i>, as they say in Germany.

16:39.165 --> 16:41.145
My German's a little bit rusty, I must admit.

16:41.200 --> 16:43.146
Oh, God. So is mine.

16:44.303 --> 16:46.806
<i>Ich muss wieder zur Schule gehen.</i>

16:49.442 --> 16:50.887
Absolutely.

16:50.977 --> 16:52.456
Good times.

16:53.446 --> 16:55.119
- At school?
- What?

16:55.448 --> 16:57.553
I said, "I should go back to school."

16:57.650 --> 17:00.722
Yes. Well, the thing about German is

17:00.820 --> 17:02.322
- once it's with you, it stays with you.
- Mmm-hmm.

17:02.388 --> 17:04.993
It's like riding <i>ein</i> bike.

17:06.492 --> 17:09.837
Is the Vice President in the Lady
Chapel with the German chancellor?

17:09.962 --> 17:12.374
No, I told you before, she's on the phone.

17:13.532 --> 17:14.876
Okay.

17:14.967 --> 17:17.538
Okay, because
is that not quite clearly her hat?

17:21.707 --> 17:23.414
No, I don't think it is.

17:23.509 --> 17:24.714
No, that's not her hat.

17:24.810 --> 17:26.153
I think it is her hat.

17:26.212 --> 17:28.692
It's definitely her hat.

17:28.748 --> 17:30.250
I'll tell you howl know, because I remember

17:30.349 --> 17:34.058
when I first saw it, thinking to myself,
"What a hideous hat."

17:34.153 --> 17:37.430
It is like she stuck her head
in a swan and it's exploded.

17:39.992 --> 17:41.335
I don't believe it is, sir.

17:42.161 --> 17:44.163
Well, <i>du lügst.</i>

17:45.398 --> 17:46.604
Hilarious.

17:46.699 --> 17:47.871
It means "you're lying."

17:47.934 --> 17:49.004
I know.

17:50.870 --> 17:54.283
Okay. Okay, so we're all
perfectly comfortable standing here

17:54.373 --> 17:56.853
pretending that we can't
quite clearly see the Vice President

17:57.343 --> 17:59.880
in the Lady Chapel
with the German chancellor

17:59.946 --> 18:02.187
finalizing a deal about the TSO?

18:05.551 --> 18:08.088
I wouldn't say "comfortable."

18:08.220 --> 18:09.631
Maybe that's her hat?

18:09.722 --> 18:11.633
I'll see you at the press conference.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.436
Okay, so, unelected loony

18:15.528 --> 18:18.099
has the ear and minge of the Vice President.

18:18.197 --> 18:20.803
And he says that fat people... No, fat kids...

18:20.900 --> 18:23.278
Fat kiddies have "sinned" in a past life. Yes.

18:23.369 --> 18:25.713
Yeah. You know how upsetting
that's gonna be to fat people?

18:25.771 --> 18:27.307
All of America is fat people.

18:27.406 --> 18:28.476
That's all we have.

18:28.574 --> 18:31.578
All of our children weigh 300 fucking pounds.

18:31.644 --> 18:33.248
We've got fat kids too. I've got a fat kid.

18:33.312 --> 18:35.314
Well, I can see her... I mean, that's...

18:35.414 --> 18:36.950
She's...

18:37.049 --> 18:38.460
Right. We'll ambush the Vice President.

18:38.551 --> 18:41.464
We'll get photos of her being surrounded
by fat kids dressed as devils.

18:41.554 --> 18:42.828
Seriously?
-Yeah.

18:42.922 --> 18:44.731
Oh, my God. You guys are fucking brutal.

18:45.091 --> 18:46.126
This calls for a celebration.

18:46.225 --> 18:47.932
Come on, I'll give you the first pint, at least.

18:53.399 --> 18:56.278
<i>And, of course, those volunteers
who tend the war cemetery graves.</i>

18:57.570 --> 18:59.641
Let's take some questions.

18:59.739 --> 19:01.343
<i>Nick Hadley, Daily Express.</i>

19:01.440 --> 19:03.181
- Okay.
- Madam Vice President,

19:03.275 --> 19:05.812
can you comment on the breaking story

19:05.911 --> 19:08.152
about your personal trainer,

19:08.247 --> 19:09.487
Ray Whelans?

19:09.982 --> 19:12.326
<i>- Or would you like to comment?</i>
- (RAY CHUCKLES

19:12.418 --> 19:13.863
<i>Well, I don't know</i>

19:13.953 --> 19:16.024
what story it is you're referring to.
I'm so sorry...

19:16.489 --> 19:18.127
<i>He wrote an essay saying,</i>

19:18.424 --> 19:21.166
"Obese children are possessed by the devil

19:21.260 --> 19:23.604
"as a punishment for past sins."

19:24.296 --> 19:25.297
Uh, wow...

19:25.598 --> 19:26.668
<i>Goodness. I...</i>

19:26.766 --> 19:28.109
Way to go, Dan.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.545
- Way to go, Ray.
- Yeah, just throw the blame around.

19:30.636 --> 19:32.047
Not at me, though. It's not my fault.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.775
Your source? I don't know anything about it.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.216
The essay's online, here.

19:35.307 --> 19:37.014
Is it? Okay.

19:37.443 --> 19:38.945
That is a thoroughly bizarre story.

19:39.045 --> 19:40.820
It's called "cosmic balance."

19:40.880 --> 19:42.553
It's not anything the Buddha didn't talk about.

19:42.648 --> 19:44.787
Yeah, well, Buddha's got a big fat ass, Ray.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.852
I believe in karma.

19:46.952 --> 19:48.898
- Does that make me weird?
- Yes!

19:48.988 --> 19:51.025
It just has
quotes leaping out. Here's one.

19:51.190 --> 19:54.171
"Body fat stores all that is bad in us.

19:54.226 --> 19:57.332
"Too much, and the host is enveloped in sin."

19:58.664 --> 19:59.904
Guys, I wrote a treatise

19:59.999 --> 20:02.377
a couple of years ago. I write a lot of treati.

20:02.468 --> 20:03.538
It's treatises, Ray.

20:03.636 --> 20:04.842
The normal plural.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.482
- Hello?
<i>- Hey, I just wanted</i>

20:06.539 --> 20:07.847
to say thanks for the lead,

20:07.907 --> 20:10.148
- "me olde Pearly Queen."
- My pleasure.

20:10.409 --> 20:11.479
Another?

20:12.178 --> 20:13.555
Two more. Two pints, please.

20:13.646 --> 20:14.886
I was wondering if you were

20:14.980 --> 20:16.653
<i>available this evening by chance</i>

20:16.716 --> 20:18.354
<i>you would like to join me for some dinner.</i>

20:18.417 --> 20:19.987
I've found a very charming gastropub.

20:20.486 --> 20:22.329
That sounds lovely. Brilliant.

20:22.488 --> 20:24.593
Text the details lo my cell, mobile.

20:24.690 --> 20:26.067
So this idea that

20:26.158 --> 20:27.501
"fat is fate,"

20:27.660 --> 20:28.832
that's nonsense, is it?

20:29.261 --> 20:30.706
I am certain that

20:30.763 --> 20:34.233
the Deputy Prime Minister
would like to move on now

20:34.333 --> 20:36.574
to the matters at hand.

20:36.669 --> 20:37.670
Oh, uh...

20:37.737 --> 20:38.909
I think we're in it now.

20:39.004 --> 20:40.415
I think we probably should,

20:40.506 --> 20:41.917
maybe, see this through to the end.

20:42.007 --> 20:43.350
What's going on?

20:43.409 --> 20:44.513
Well, where is she?

20:44.577 --> 20:45.749
Yeah, I got this.

20:45.845 --> 20:47.051
I got this. I can...

20:47.413 --> 20:48.414
Uh...

20:48.514 --> 20:49.754
Here's what we're gonna do.

20:49.849 --> 20:52.022
We are gonna go big on Prince Charles.

20:52.284 --> 20:53.524
No, no, scratch that.

20:53.586 --> 20:54.758
- We're gonna cancel Charles.
- What?

20:54.854 --> 20:56.265
We're canceling Charles, okay?

20:56.355 --> 20:57.698
Do you hate fat people?

20:58.023 --> 20:59.934
You know what,
let me just put this to rest, okay?

21:00.025 --> 21:04.735
I have always been a friend
of the  full-figured folks.

21:04.864 --> 21:06.810
Okay, my pretend friends.

21:06.899 --> 21:08.276
I got to go back to DC.

21:08.367 --> 21:09.778
Something very big has happened

21:09.869 --> 21:11.212
and I've got to be there.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.647
- What is it?
- Daniwah!

21:12.738 --> 21:13.739
- Daniwah.
- What's that?

21:13.806 --> 21:14.807
Daniwah.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.816
Easy, buddy.

21:18.911 --> 21:20.788
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Get your hands off me, all right?

21:21.046 --> 21:22.787
- I don't want to catch your fucking idiocy.
- Okay.

21:22.882 --> 21:24.953
- I can...
- Whoa!

21:25.050 --> 21:27.257
Oh, he's having a heart attack.
Are you having a heart attack?

21:27.319 --> 21:28.764
No, I think he's just
having a breakdown.

21:28.821 --> 21:31.427
- I think this is, like, indigestion or something.
- Easy.

21:31.924 --> 21:34.404
I don't think I should have
eaten that Scotch egg.

21:34.460 --> 21:36.098
Is that that egg with
the sausage wrapped around it?

21:36.162 --> 21:37.470
Never mind. Not important.

21:37.563 --> 21:39.406
Ray, I need to speak with you privately.

21:39.465 --> 21:40.569
Mike,

21:40.633 --> 21:41.668
you're in charge.

21:43.335 --> 21:44.439
Yes, sir.

21:44.503 --> 21:46.505
Oh, my God, Mike.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.414
Oh, my God.

21:48.774 --> 21:51.254
I got... I got this, I got this.

21:52.077 --> 21:55.684
Siri, Ray Whelans' treati. Treatises!

21:55.781 --> 21:56.851
Okay, okay.

21:57.683 --> 21:59.424
People are disturbed by your role.

21:59.485 --> 22:01.988
Yeah, they think folks who are physical
can't be cerebral.

22:02.087 --> 22:06.365
They think those two things are
separate, that they're not symbiotic.

22:06.525 --> 22:08.163
No, no, you don't understand.

22:08.260 --> 22:09.330
I do, I do. Look,

22:09.428 --> 22:11.999
people think that, you know,
"He's a fitness guy,

22:12.097 --> 22:13.508
"how can he know about politics?"

22:13.599 --> 22:14.600
I get you, Kent.

22:15.801 --> 22:18.304
Again, I don't think you do.

22:18.771 --> 22:21.342
People think Selina's judgment is bad

22:21.440 --> 22:24.182
if she listens to people like you

22:24.276 --> 22:25.949
whose beliefs are very

22:26.011 --> 22:27.012
- stupid.
- Exactly.

22:27.112 --> 22:28.113
People.

22:28.447 --> 22:29.448
You're not getting it.

22:29.515 --> 22:31.825
You know, the brain is a muscle.

22:32.451 --> 22:33.486
No, it isn't.

22:33.719 --> 22:34.789
And I have sympathy.

22:34.854 --> 22:36.663
I do have

22:36.722 --> 22:39.498
deep sympathy for those who struggle
with their weight.

22:39.558 --> 22:43.062
And I will go on
to say that even I, as a young teenager,

22:43.162 --> 22:44.368
had a bit of a struggle

22:44.463 --> 22:47.000
with my weight as I'm sure

22:47.066 --> 22:50.673
almost everyone here in this room has had

22:50.736 --> 22:52.647
atone moment or another in their life.

22:59.478 --> 23:00.479
I can't feel my hands.

23:00.546 --> 23:02.184
- Do you feel my hands?
- No. Yeah. I do.

23:02.248 --> 23:04.091
Okay. I can feel them,
but that's not how it works.

23:04.183 --> 23:05.491
I'm googling your symptoms right now.

23:05.551 --> 23:06.552
What are your symptoms?

23:06.652 --> 23:08.996
- Massive pain.
- Yeah. Where? In your chest?

23:09.054 --> 23:11.091
Yeah, like right where my hand is clutching.

23:11.190 --> 23:12.191
The pain is right around there.

23:12.758 --> 23:14.169
- I'm trying to help.
- Like, under my heart?

23:14.226 --> 23:15.569
Right in the middle...

23:15.661 --> 23:17.402
Do you taste copper?

23:17.997 --> 23:19.738
I think you're having a panic attack.
That's what...

23:19.832 --> 23:21.334
No, no, no.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.004
I don't panic. I'm the fucking iceman.

23:23.068 --> 23:24.172
That's why I'm the campaign manager.

23:25.671 --> 23:26.615
Call Sue.

23:26.705 --> 23:28.241
What's the codes you put before the number?

23:28.340 --> 23:29.410
0-0-1. U.S.

23:29.508 --> 23:31.249
I just have her name,
so I need to memorize the number

23:31.343 --> 23:32.549
before I put the codes in.

23:32.678 --> 23:34.214
Hey, Sue? Sorry. Hey, listen...

23:35.948 --> 23:36.949
Shit.

23:37.082 --> 23:38.527
How much exactly did you weigh?

23:38.617 --> 23:39.618
Uh...

23:39.718 --> 23:41.755
Okay. Well, at my very biggest,
I would say I was probably

23:41.854 --> 23:44.460
roughly around 151

23:44.556 --> 23:46.035
or 152 pounds.

23:46.091 --> 23:49.937
I don't know what that translates to
in terms of stones.

23:50.696 --> 23:52.300
- That's a lot.
- Yeah, heavy.

23:52.398 --> 23:53.968
Is it? That's a lot? Okay.

23:54.233 --> 23:55.712
This is like the Queen's china.

23:55.801 --> 23:57.803
They're never gonna
let us back into England again.

23:57.903 --> 23:59.439
We need to research everything
Ray Whelans ever wrote...

23:59.538 --> 24:00.539
oh. my God!

24:00.606 --> 24:02.051
- It doesn't matter.
- It does matter!

24:02.107 --> 24:03.916
This is the fuckin' Queen's china!

24:04.376 --> 24:07.914
It's been something that's...
You know, it's a part... It's my history.

24:07.980 --> 24:11.951
I can't say that I was proud to be
as enormous as I was,

24:12.051 --> 24:13.428
but there you have it.

24:13.485 --> 24:16.091
- What are you looking for?
- I'm looking for a napkin to at least cover it.

24:18.390 --> 24:20.392
Behind the curtain.
Put it behind the curtain.

24:21.827 --> 24:22.828
Go.

24:24.663 --> 24:26.939
You really don't get it,

24:26.999 --> 24:30.139
so I'm going to keep this very simple.
You're fired.

24:31.603 --> 24:32.809
I get you.

24:33.339 --> 24:35.012
Very simple.

24:35.908 --> 24:37.353
- Yes, it is.
- Great.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.422
I'm so pleased we had this talk.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.355
Let's see where we all are in a month or so.

24:42.481 --> 24:43.585
This is amazing.

24:44.283 --> 24:45.694
Thank you.

24:46.085 --> 24:47.758
- Hurry up, Gary.
- Shit.

24:50.122 --> 24:51.795
Oh, my God.

24:51.857 --> 24:55.964
What a fuckin' misery marathon that was.

24:58.764 --> 25:01.142
- Where is everybody?
- Dan had a nervous collapse.

25:01.200 --> 25:02.770
Amy's taking him to the hospital.

25:02.835 --> 25:05.509
Ben went back to DC. Kent's firing Ray.

25:05.604 --> 25:06.605
And I'm in charge.

25:08.273 --> 25:09.217
Fuck!

25:09.308 --> 25:10.446
I know, right?

25:10.509 --> 25:12.113
I should just go back out there.

25:13.112 --> 25:14.182
Did you see that?

25:14.279 --> 25:15.349
Yep, I saw.

25:15.447 --> 25:16.448
Why?

25:16.515 --> 25:20.827
Why am I in London
talking about my enormous

25:20.886 --> 25:22.991
jiggly-ass ass?

25:23.055 --> 25:26.969
Ma'am, but people love people
who were like fat and they're no longer fat.

25:27.026 --> 25:28.300
- No, they don't.
- Right.

25:28.627 --> 25:30.868
Fat people don't even vote.

25:30.963 --> 25:33.307
They can't even be bothered
to get out of the house, you know?

25:33.866 --> 25:35.470
There's no food in the voting booth.

25:35.968 --> 25:36.969
Ma'am,

25:37.036 --> 25:40.540
the House of Commons voted
to censure U.S. data monitoring activities.

25:40.639 --> 25:41.640
Huh?

25:41.740 --> 25:45.244
And there's five fat kids outside
dressed as Satan.

25:48.847 --> 25:50.155
Already?

25:51.216 --> 25:52.320
You know what we're gonna do?

25:52.384 --> 25:54.523
We're gonna cancel on Prince Charles.

25:54.586 --> 25:55.929
Gary, we're gonna have to get out of here

25:56.021 --> 25:57.329
the back way or something.

25:59.558 --> 26:00.593
- Gary?
- Yep, yep.

26:07.166 --> 26:09.544
God, I hate this
stupid country so much.

26:09.601 --> 26:11.205
Nothing makes sense here, you know?

26:11.270 --> 26:12.578
You ask what temperature it is,

26:12.671 --> 26:15.675
you get some tiny little number.
I don't know what...

26:15.741 --> 26:17.379
What? What is that supposed to mean?

26:17.443 --> 26:20.185
Even the plugs here are bigger

26:20.245 --> 26:22.350
than the things that they power.

26:22.414 --> 26:23.586
Okay, ma'am, I've got to say something,

26:23.715 --> 26:25.524
so do not interrupt me. All right?

26:25.617 --> 26:27.221
I will interrupt you whenever
I want to interrupt you.

26:27.286 --> 26:29.288
Okay, okay, but this is...

26:29.388 --> 26:31.061
Like right now.
If I wanted to interrupt you right now.

26:31.123 --> 26:32.761
Okay. Ray is poison.
He's got nothing to do with wellness.

26:32.858 --> 26:35.429
He's a sickness, and you've got him bad,
and you've got to get rid of him.

26:37.029 --> 26:39.600
Do you actually think that I don't know that?

26:39.698 --> 26:41.609
I just got "Brit-fucked"

26:41.700 --> 26:43.043
by that balloon animal.

26:43.569 --> 26:45.549
Ray's gone. Trust me.

26:46.972 --> 26:49.543
That is such a huge relief.

26:49.641 --> 26:51.621
He was getting into everything' you know?

26:51.710 --> 26:52.654
Yeah, I know, I know.

26:52.744 --> 26:54.280
I mean, my God,

26:54.379 --> 26:56.757
Dan only hired him as a sex slave.

26:59.885 --> 27:00.989
What?

27:01.086 --> 27:02.087
Uh...

27:04.223 --> 27:05.759
Dan,

27:05.824 --> 27:07.667
he hired Ray as a...

27:07.759 --> 27:11.434
As a sex slave, did you not know?

27:11.497 --> 27:12.737
He...

27:13.465 --> 27:14.944
He pimped me out?

27:15.000 --> 27:17.241
Yeah, yeah.

27:25.244 --> 27:26.416
Who knows about this?

27:27.579 --> 27:28.922
Me, Amy and Mike.

27:28.981 --> 27:31.359
- Okay.
- And Ben, Kent and Sue. Everybody.

27:31.450 --> 27:32.986
Everybody pretty much knows, ma'am.

27:33.085 --> 27:34.291
Give me my phone.

27:34.419 --> 27:36.160
Just give it to me.

27:36.588 --> 27:37.828
Yeah.

27:37.923 --> 27:39.334
Dan is so fired.

27:43.762 --> 27:45.002
I gotta say, Amy.

27:45.097 --> 27:46.337
You're like an actual friend.
I mean,

27:46.431 --> 27:49.002
throughout all this, you know,
me being made campaign manager over you,

27:49.101 --> 27:51.047
I mean, you could have been a real bitch,
and you've been great.

27:51.136 --> 27:53.480
Well, I guess I'm a team player, so.

27:53.539 --> 27:54.540
Knock, knock.

27:55.440 --> 27:56.646
Hey, buddy, how you doing?

27:57.543 --> 27:58.954
Am I hallucinating?

27:59.011 --> 28:00.183
Can I please get some better drugs?

28:00.279 --> 28:01.849
How are you feeling? You doing okay?

28:01.947 --> 28:04.154
What the fuck are you doing here, Jonah?

28:04.283 --> 28:06.388
What, are you molesting coma patients?

28:06.618 --> 28:07.619
Is that a thing?

28:07.686 --> 28:10.292
I might, now.
Maybe I'll just put them in some funny hats.

28:10.489 --> 28:13.026
No, I'm just here because I wanted to

28:13.125 --> 28:16.004
tell you how sorry I am that you
had a massive nervous breakdown.

28:16.195 --> 28:17.333
Oh, yeah.

28:17.796 --> 28:21.300
I also just wanted to tell you
that I'm the one that broke you,

28:21.633 --> 28:24.546
because I broke that personal trainer story,

28:26.071 --> 28:27.049
that was me.

28:27.139 --> 28:28.174
What are you talking about?

28:28.240 --> 28:30.914
Oh, I got a tip from some
super hot British chick.

28:31.009 --> 28:32.488
I'm actually going to see her right now.

28:32.544 --> 28:34.182
So those flowers aren't for Dan?

28:34.246 --> 28:35.384
Fuck, no.

28:35.480 --> 28:37.221
No, those are for my filthy Mary Poppins,

28:37.316 --> 28:39.489
and I'm gonna give her
a "spoonful of sugar."

28:39.551 --> 28:40.757
How delightful.

28:40.852 --> 28:43.230
I have to go, so get well, and...

28:44.256 --> 28:46.827
Ah, on the other hand,

28:46.892 --> 28:49.031
Selina just fired you as campaign manager,

28:49.161 --> 28:51.232
so take as long as you need.

28:51.330 --> 28:52.832
Take longer.

28:55.434 --> 28:57.277
Sue, forgive me.

28:57.369 --> 28:58.404
This is a terrible thing to ask,

28:58.503 --> 29:02.417
but I'm afraid that we're
going to have to cancel Prince Charles.

29:02.507 --> 29:06.853
Do you realize how difficult and demeaning
it was for me to set up that meeting?

29:07.012 --> 29:08.218
And it was a triumph, Sue.

29:08.347 --> 29:10.691
You have put me in a hideous situation.

29:10.749 --> 29:12.023
Remotely, I might add.

29:12.084 --> 29:14.758
So from now on,
remotely is how we will interact.

29:15.554 --> 29:17.693
Sue, there's no need to take that tone.

29:17.756 --> 29:21.101
I'm used to a better class of tone, so just...

29:27.132 --> 29:28.202
She had to take another call.

29:28.300 --> 29:29.438
- Uh-huh.
- Of course. Okay.

29:30.369 --> 29:31.473
I have to take this outside.

29:31.570 --> 29:32.640
Yep.

29:37.909 --> 29:39.547
My flight doesn't leave until tomorrow night,

29:39.645 --> 29:41.955
so I figured it makes sense for me
to be on Air Force Two.

29:43.382 --> 29:45.726
Uh. In what world would that make sense?

29:46.551 --> 29:48.656
You need to get on your running machine,

29:48.754 --> 29:49.960
and run away.

29:50.289 --> 29:52.098
Running machines don't go anywhere.

29:53.392 --> 29:54.427
I understand.

29:54.493 --> 29:55.836
I get it.

29:56.495 --> 29:57.496
Ma'am.

29:58.797 --> 30:00.401
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

30:00.732 --> 30:03.679
Oh, my God. Seriously?

30:03.769 --> 30:06.249
Okay, let's just,

30:06.338 --> 30:07.942
add it to the fucking heap.

30:08.006 --> 30:10.452
The First Lady has attempted
to take her own life.

30:12.477 --> 30:14.286
Oh! What?

30:16.081 --> 30:17.025
How?

30:17.115 --> 30:18.992
Overdose of sleeping pills and vodka.

30:19.084 --> 30:21.030
That's why POTUS sent for Ben.

30:21.119 --> 30:22.154
It was touch and go there for a while.

30:22.954 --> 30:23.955
Oh...

30:26.925 --> 30:29.804
Really makes you put your own problems
into perspective. Doesn't it?

30:29.861 --> 30:30.999
Seriously.

30:31.096 --> 30:32.666
It does.

30:32.764 --> 30:34.835
Although your problems are still pretty bad.

30:34.933 --> 30:36.344
Yeah, they are.

30:37.469 --> 30:39.449
I couldn't help but overhear,
but I always thought

30:39.504 --> 30:41.541
that lady was a little damaged.

30:41.940 --> 30:44.284
Jesus fucking Christ.

30:44.343 --> 30:45.481
You're fired.

30:45.610 --> 30:47.112
Okay? Get out.

30:47.813 --> 30:49.952
Unbelievable.
-SELINA; Isn't it?

30:50.682 --> 30:51.990
All right, so I think this is the last of it.

30:52.951 --> 30:53.952
Okay.

30:54.519 --> 30:56.123
Wait, wait. What are we gonna do about Dan?

30:56.188 --> 30:58.031
I don't care. He missed the last chopper out.

30:58.123 --> 30:59.466
And, Ame?

31:00.459 --> 31:02.200
You are now officially

31:02.294 --> 31:03.739
the new campaign manager.

31:05.197 --> 31:06.699
Yes, ma'am. Thank you.

31:06.798 --> 31:07.799
Okay.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.209
So then I'm not in charge anymore?

31:09.301 --> 31:10.473
Correct.

31:10.569 --> 31:12.207
Good, 'cause I could use a nap.

31:13.972 --> 31:15.815
Okay, let's get the merrie olde fuck

31:15.874 --> 31:16.875
out of merrie olde England.

31:16.975 --> 31:19.854
I need to be driven to the airport
at "Diana speed," okay?

31:20.479 --> 31:22.322
Just more carefully, though, please.

31:30.689 --> 31:31.690
Ow.

31:39.197 --> 31:41.074
<i>Okay, let's check out your chart.</i>

31:41.166 --> 31:43.840
Let's see how you're doing here. Okay.

31:44.236 --> 31:46.079
All right. "Dan Egan,
