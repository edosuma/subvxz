<i>Remember what I told you
when you were 16</i>

00:03.921 --> 00:05.843
<i>and you first came to live at my house?</i>

00:05.881 --> 00:07.514
Never forget I love you.

00:09.596 --> 00:11.329
Him and his wife took me in.

00:11.371 --> 00:12.704
They saved me.

00:12.739 --> 00:14.372
<i>You go pulling a thread,</i>

00:14.408 --> 00:16.207
there's no telling what all unravels.

00:16.282 --> 00:18.149
Don't you want to know what happened?

00:18.184 --> 00:20.784
I do not regret what I did here.

00:20.819 --> 00:22.418
<i>I'm gonna ask Erin to marry me.</i>

00:22.454 --> 00:23.720
She's been there for me,

00:23.756 --> 00:25.221
and I want to be there for her.

00:25.257 --> 00:27.423
I'm FBI Special Agent Jennifer Spencer.

00:27.459 --> 00:28.659
I'm here with a job offer.

00:28.694 --> 00:30.260
They want me in New York.

00:30.295 --> 00:31.628
You know about this.

00:31.664 --> 00:35.165
Well, I knew I needed to do something.

00:35.200 --> 00:36.667
Don't look back.

<i>The truth is, I'm not really sure</i>

01:22.480 --> 01:25.314
<i>how I feel about it.</i>

01:26.351 --> 01:28.087
I'm...

01:28.452 --> 01:32.688
I'm not really good at that stuff,
though, you know, <i>how I feel about it.</i>

01:32.723 --> 01:35.824
expressing feelings.

01:38.195 --> 01:41.463
I know I had no choice.

01:41.498 --> 01:43.965
I mean, she had to go.

01:45.636 --> 01:48.837
So... in that sense,

01:48.872 --> 01:51.240
I don't really regret what I did.

01:54.511 --> 01:56.311
Just...

01:59.049 --> 02:00.682
I mean, now that she's really gone,

02:00.718 --> 02:04.119
I'm just feeling...

02:04.154 --> 02:05.120
Huh.

02:05.155 --> 02:07.656
Lonely?

02:07.691 --> 02:09.624
Yeah.

02:09.658 --> 02:11.292
Yeah.

02:15.365 --> 02:18.432
She was like a daughter to me.

02:19.936 --> 02:22.103
It's gonna be tough.

02:24.875 --> 02:27.541
Really tough.

02:30.513 --> 02:32.046
I'm sorry.

02:39.990 --> 02:42.156
I gotta go.

02:42.192 --> 02:45.326
The gun dealers
are two bikers out of Indiana.

02:45.362 --> 02:48.363
Buyers are gangbangers
associated with Southside Hawks.

02:48.398 --> 02:50.130
We don't have any names yet.

02:50.165 --> 02:51.932
Uh, deal's going down
inside the old seminary.

02:51.967 --> 02:53.462
It's been abandoned for five years.

02:53.487 --> 02:55.691
Two adjacent buildings
are abandoned as well.

02:55.805 --> 02:57.605
Once we're inside, Al and I

02:57.640 --> 02:59.306
are gonna enter here from the west.

02:59.341 --> 03:01.609
Ruzek, you and Atwater going in here.

03:01.644 --> 03:04.211
Upton and Halstead, you go in this way.

03:04.246 --> 03:05.813
<i>Sarge...</i>

03:05.848 --> 03:07.381
<i>we have got movement on the west side.</i>

03:07.416 --> 03:09.115
One male, white. One male, Hispanic.

03:09.150 --> 03:11.984
Both 5'10" to 6,' about 170 pounds,

03:12.020 --> 03:13.453
tatted up, carrying large duffle bags.

03:13.488 --> 03:17.023
They just got out of a black SUV with...

03:17.058 --> 03:18.291
with Indiana tags.

03:18.326 --> 03:20.126
Copy that. Here we go.

03:43.517 --> 03:45.083
<i>10-1, 10-1. Shots fired at police.</i>

03:45.118 --> 03:46.985
4533 West Archer.

03:47.020 --> 03:48.520
- You ready? You ready?
- Yeah.

03:50.925 --> 03:52.424
Go.

03:52.460 --> 03:53.992
Go!

03:56.296 --> 03:58.764
- I got these guys.
- All right. Go.

04:21.488 --> 04:23.188
- I'm going to find Jay.
- Copy that.

04:32.564 --> 04:34.031
Out of the way! Get out of the way!

04:34.066 --> 04:35.332
Get out of the way!

04:41.474 --> 04:43.240
5021 George, I'm taking heavy fire.

04:43.275 --> 04:44.941
I got two civilians down
in the north alley

04:44.977 --> 04:46.209
<i>behind the building.</i>

04:46.244 --> 04:47.543
This is sergeant Hank Voight.

04:47.578 --> 04:49.212
<i>Advise responding to shut down</i>

04:49.247 --> 04:51.481
<i>- a two-block radius.
- Copy that.</i>

04:51.516 --> 04:54.117
- We'll set up a two-block...
<i>- Help! Help!</i>

04:54.152 --> 04:56.552
We have multiple armed offenders.

04:56.587 --> 04:58.954
Approach with extreme caution.

05:02.627 --> 05:04.460
- What happened?
- I don't know. I heard crying.

05:04.496 --> 05:06.628
Get these kids out
the west exit right now. Now!

05:06.663 --> 05:08.130
All right, I'm gonna call an ambulance.

05:08.165 --> 05:09.231
We don't have time. Get your car.

05:09.266 --> 05:11.333
I'm gonna meet you up front.

05:25.955 --> 05:27.288
She's in bad shape.

05:27.323 --> 05:28.856
But we're doing everything we can.

05:28.891 --> 05:30.758
What are the odds?

05:30.793 --> 05:32.860
Like I said,
we're doing everything we can.

05:32.895 --> 05:34.962
We know. What about
the other two victims?

05:34.997 --> 05:37.130
- Are they okay?
- Walk with me.

05:37.166 --> 05:38.799
James Pell, the bullet grazed his leg.

05:38.834 --> 05:40.601
He's fine; we're just
finishing up some paperwork.

05:40.636 --> 05:42.603
Hey, what about the other victim?

05:42.638 --> 05:45.439
She didn't make it. Dead on arrival.

05:45.474 --> 05:47.841
I gotta sign the papers,
or can I go now?

05:47.877 --> 05:49.209
Just sit tight.

05:49.244 --> 05:51.144
Mr. Pell, we'd like to talk to you

05:51.180 --> 05:52.612
about what happened earlier today.

05:52.647 --> 05:54.514
I got shot in the leg,
that's what happened.

05:54.550 --> 05:56.116
Did you see the men who shot you?

05:56.151 --> 05:58.452
- No.
- Not even a quick glimpse?

05:58.487 --> 06:00.687
Look, Officer, I was just involved

06:00.722 --> 06:02.055
in a traumatic incident.

06:02.091 --> 06:03.390
I'm still in a state of shock.

06:03.425 --> 06:05.959
So, please, no more questions.

06:05.994 --> 06:07.561
All right.

06:07.596 --> 06:09.129
We'll get your contact information.

06:09.164 --> 06:10.497
Call you later on.

06:11.900 --> 06:13.733
Okay, we have three gunshot victims:

06:13.768 --> 06:16.236
female, black, 20s, dead on arrival.

06:16.271 --> 06:17.971
Male, black, mid-20s, named James Pell,

06:18.006 --> 06:19.472
treated and released.

06:19.507 --> 06:20.840
- The bullet just grazed his leg.
- Huh.

06:20.875 --> 06:22.141
And a little girl around eight.

06:22.176 --> 06:23.710
She's in critical condition.

06:23.745 --> 06:25.377
All right, the guy who
got nicked, we talk to him?

06:25.413 --> 06:26.646
We tried. He wasn't too cooperative.

06:26.681 --> 06:28.514
He claims he's still in shock.

06:28.549 --> 06:30.149
And what are those kids
doing there in the first place?

06:30.184 --> 06:31.517
It turns out the building was used

06:31.552 --> 06:33.319
as an off-the-books day care center.

06:33.354 --> 06:34.654
For ten bucks a day,
someone in the neighborhood

06:34.689 --> 06:35.922
will watch your kid.

06:35.957 --> 06:37.590
Boss, two bikers killed at the scene.

06:37.626 --> 06:39.759
One was Anthony Jonas, 24.

06:39.794 --> 06:41.160
Other Mike Scola, 26.

06:41.195 --> 06:42.829
Both from Gary, Indiana.

06:42.864 --> 06:44.563
And they're both affiliated
with the Gargoyle Kings.

06:44.599 --> 06:46.164
That's the biker gang
your CI told us about.

06:46.199 --> 06:47.666
All right, hit the streets.

06:47.701 --> 06:49.334
Talk to your CIs.
Let's find these shooters.

06:49.369 --> 06:52.938
- Hank, got a sec?
- Yeah.

06:52.973 --> 06:55.373
<i>Your team's all over the news.</i>

06:56.376 --> 06:58.176
You talking about
the thing this morning?

06:58.211 --> 07:00.779
Three innocents hit, one dead?

07:00.814 --> 07:03.515
We're taking down a gun deal.
The suspects opened fire.

07:03.550 --> 07:06.051
The independent auditor
will be reviewing this incident.

07:06.086 --> 07:07.718
Independent auditor?

07:07.754 --> 07:09.687
Part of the new reform package.

07:09.722 --> 07:11.922
Huh.

07:17.397 --> 07:19.531
Nice to see you, Hank.

07:19.566 --> 07:21.132
Denny.

07:21.168 --> 07:23.134
Mayor just made it official.

07:23.170 --> 07:25.970
Denny's the independent auditor.

07:26.005 --> 07:28.640
You wanna give us
a couple minutes to catch up?

07:28.675 --> 07:30.907
- Sure.
- Thank you, Chief.

07:32.811 --> 07:35.479
So it's been, what, six months?

07:35.514 --> 07:37.581
Yeah, something like that.

07:37.616 --> 07:39.216
Well, they finally looked into my file

07:39.251 --> 07:40.784
and realized I'm a good cop.

07:40.819 --> 07:43.787
And the only case in question...
the Ruffalo thing...

07:43.822 --> 07:45.722
it just went away.

07:45.757 --> 07:47.391
Mm-hmm.

07:47.426 --> 07:49.759
And now they've got me overseeing

07:49.795 --> 07:52.095
the whole Chicago PD.

07:52.130 --> 07:53.763
Independent auditor.

07:53.799 --> 07:57.233
Makes me sound like somewhat
of a, uh... an accountant.

07:57.268 --> 07:59.836
Hmm.

07:59.871 --> 08:02.405
Eh, more like a judge.

08:04.275 --> 08:08.144
Hank, I just want to say
that, uh, the past...

08:08.180 --> 08:09.846
is the past.

08:09.881 --> 08:11.681
Hmm.

08:11.717 --> 08:14.617
All that nonsense
that happened between us...

08:20.991 --> 08:22.624
It's over.

08:23.961 --> 08:25.928
That's good to know.

08:28.632 --> 08:30.899
Be seeing you, Hank.

08:35.572 --> 08:37.438
Hey, what's going on? Who is this?

08:37.474 --> 08:39.807
He's here to install cameras
in the interrogation room.

08:39.842 --> 08:41.876
Direct order from the superintendent.

08:41.910 --> 08:43.778
Yeah, after his new

08:43.813 --> 08:45.813
independent auditor gave him the idea.

08:45.849 --> 08:48.182
Well, whoever it was,
they want it done today.

08:48.218 --> 08:49.550
First hall on your left.

08:49.585 --> 08:50.984
If I wasn't so doe-eyed and optimistic,

08:51.019 --> 08:53.621
I'd say we have
a trust issue on our hands.

08:53.656 --> 08:54.821
Hmm.

08:54.857 --> 08:58.359
Anyway, I've got 20 officers
on the ground in the vicinity

08:58.394 --> 08:59.727
looking for the two shooters.

08:59.762 --> 09:01.027
I'll let you know when I hear something.

09:01.063 --> 09:03.029
- Thanks.
- Sure.

09:03.065 --> 09:05.031
- Any witnesses?
- Not yet.

09:05.067 --> 09:07.234
- What about the kids?
- They didn't see anything,

09:07.270 --> 09:08.702
except that little girl get shot.

09:08.738 --> 09:10.337
How long has the daycare been here?

09:10.373 --> 09:12.339
Don't know.
Still looking for the parents.

09:12.375 --> 09:13.840
Excuse me, sir.

09:13.876 --> 09:15.842
This is an active
crime scene investigation.

09:15.878 --> 09:18.812
Active? Hell, I see
five cops sipping coffee,

09:18.847 --> 09:21.047
two smoking cigarettes, and one
having a roast beef sandwich.

09:21.083 --> 09:22.983
- Please step away.
- Who's in charge here, you?

09:23.018 --> 09:24.985
I'm Detective Olinsky.
Just don't let anybody else in.

09:25.020 --> 09:26.686
I heard a woman
got shot here and was killed

09:26.721 --> 09:28.388
and the little girl's
in critical condition.

09:28.423 --> 09:29.489
We can't comment on the investigation.

09:29.524 --> 09:30.891
So it's true, huh?

09:30.926 --> 09:32.659
I'm gonna need you to step back, sir.

09:32.694 --> 09:34.060
Why don't you just fill me in,
Detective Olinsky?

09:34.096 --> 09:35.594
Why don't I fill you in?

09:35.629 --> 09:37.529
Two gangbangers
opened fire on the police.

09:37.564 --> 09:38.998
They killed a young woman

09:39.033 --> 09:40.532
and critically injured a little girl.

09:40.567 --> 09:42.001
- That's what happened. Okay?
- I see.

09:42.036 --> 09:43.602
So you're gonna put it
on the gangbangers, huh?

09:43.637 --> 09:45.504
Yeah, that seems pretty obvious, sir.

09:45.539 --> 09:47.173
Ah, must be nice...

09:47.208 --> 09:49.108
to be so naive and beautiful too.

09:49.143 --> 09:50.442
One hell of a combination.

09:50.477 --> 09:51.844
Did you just say that?

09:51.879 --> 09:53.545
- Did you just say that?
- Hey, hey, hey.

09:53.580 --> 09:54.914
- Excuse me, Officer.
- Everything okay?

09:54.949 --> 09:56.581
- What did you say?
- Excuse me.

09:56.617 --> 09:58.416
- We're fine.
- What's going on here?

09:58.451 --> 10:01.652
Your people were just
bringing me up to speed.

10:02.823 --> 10:05.023
Alderman Price is an old friend

10:05.058 --> 10:07.425
and an important member
of the community.

10:09.996 --> 10:12.363
Hey, uh, we're looking
for a Kimona Williams.

10:12.398 --> 10:14.699
She's over there.

10:19.306 --> 10:20.371
Kimona Williams?

10:20.406 --> 10:21.806
Yeah?

10:21.841 --> 10:25.309
Ma'am, we need to talk
to you for a second.

10:25.345 --> 10:28.212
O-okay, um... just...

10:28.247 --> 10:30.648
What's the matter?
Did something happen...

10:30.683 --> 10:33.818
It's your daughter, Morgan.

10:33.853 --> 10:35.453
Morgan?

10:35.488 --> 10:36.887
- She was shot...
- No. No.

10:36.922 --> 10:38.389
At the old seminary this morning.

10:38.424 --> 10:39.457
- She's alive.
- It's okay.

10:39.492 --> 10:40.958
But is she okay?

10:40.993 --> 10:42.393
She's being treated
at Chicago Med right now.

10:42.428 --> 10:44.395
We can give you a ride, okay?

10:44.430 --> 10:46.396
Who did this? Who shot her?

10:46.431 --> 10:48.098
We're not... we're not sure.

10:48.133 --> 10:49.799
We're gonna do everything
in our power to find him.

10:49.835 --> 10:51.268
- I promise.
- Okay. Okay.

10:51.303 --> 10:53.237
Okay? We should go now.

10:53.272 --> 10:54.972
Come on.

10:57.943 --> 10:59.776
Hey, sorry. I just got your call.

10:59.811 --> 11:01.345
Finally located the girl's mother.

11:01.380 --> 11:03.146
Shut the door.

11:06.451 --> 11:08.010
What's up?

11:08.653 --> 11:10.920
I just talked to Ballistics.

11:10.955 --> 11:13.656
The bullet that hit the little
girl was a nine-millimeter.

11:13.692 --> 11:16.659
Thought the bangers were firing .45s.

11:18.329 --> 11:20.129
They were.

11:23.735 --> 11:26.536
You saying I shot that little girl?

11:38.159 --> 11:40.510
The gun that fired
the bullet on the right...

11:40.535 --> 11:42.535
the one that hit the little girl...

11:42.765 --> 11:44.651
fired the one on the left too.

11:44.862 --> 11:48.468
I'm sorry, but gun barrels don't lie.

11:48.503 --> 11:49.738
Thanks, Morty.

11:51.974 --> 11:53.519
Doesn't make sense.

11:54.443 --> 11:56.643
I was under fire, and I took cover...

11:56.679 --> 11:58.745
- Shh.
- And I fired one round,

11:58.781 --> 12:00.981
and I watched the offender drop.

12:01.277 --> 12:03.710
And then I ran over to the woman
who got shot and radioed for help.

12:03.735 --> 12:05.885
- Okay.
- I didn't hear any kids.

12:05.931 --> 12:07.430
I didn't see any kids.

12:07.455 --> 12:09.488
I didn't just shoot
my gun off in the air.

12:09.523 --> 12:13.059
If that's what happened,
you got nothing to worry about.

12:15.362 --> 12:18.230
Take some time off till
the shooting team clears you.

12:18.265 --> 12:20.733
How long is that gonna take?

12:20.768 --> 12:22.134
I mean, it might take a minute or two.

12:22.169 --> 12:24.670
Things are tricky right now.

12:24.706 --> 12:27.073
Are you saying I need to worry?

12:27.108 --> 12:30.275
I'm saying things are tricky.

12:32.279 --> 12:34.446
Yeah, Sammy,
that text message was clutch.

12:34.482 --> 12:36.115
What you got for us?

12:36.150 --> 12:38.249
I might have something
on that shoot-out this morning.

12:38.284 --> 12:40.118
I just stitched up a young gang member.

12:40.153 --> 12:42.253
Bullet wound to his lower
abdomen, went right through.

12:42.288 --> 12:43.955
How'd you know it was a gunshot wound?

12:43.991 --> 12:45.490
Please. You know how many
gunshots I've seen?

12:45.525 --> 12:47.592
I make a living turning
dead bangers into Boy Scouts

12:47.628 --> 12:49.828
so their mothers
can give them proper burials.

12:49.863 --> 12:51.596
All right, and about what time was this?

12:51.632 --> 12:52.931
About 10:00 or so.

12:52.966 --> 12:54.365
He was waiting for me when I got here.

12:54.400 --> 12:56.167
How'd he know to come to you, Sammy?

12:56.202 --> 12:58.136
For them, my morgue's
a lot better than a hospital.

12:58.171 --> 13:00.138
No paperwork, no police...

13:00.173 --> 13:01.640
not to their knowledge, anyway.

13:01.675 --> 13:03.307
You got a name for me, right?

13:03.343 --> 13:04.208
No.

13:04.244 --> 13:05.542
He wasn't exactly in the mood

13:05.577 --> 13:06.810
to give out personal details.

13:06.846 --> 13:09.813
But I did get... a license plate.

13:09.849 --> 13:13.183
- Okay.
- I'll go run it.

13:13.218 --> 13:15.385
- Thanks, Sammy.
- See you.

13:15.420 --> 13:17.821
So you really like this guy?

13:17.857 --> 13:19.156
You jealous?

13:19.191 --> 13:21.825
Yeah, a little bit.

13:21.861 --> 13:23.060
I expect to see some more of these

13:23.095 --> 13:24.628
when you make the arrest.

13:30.269 --> 13:32.835
Okay, we're going to Royal Towers, okay?

13:32.871 --> 13:34.137
Apartment 2632.

13:34.173 --> 13:35.472
Offender's black male,

13:35.507 --> 13:37.340
wiry, about 5'9", early 20s.

13:37.376 --> 13:38.975
He's got a bullet hole in his abdomen.

13:39.010 --> 13:40.510
Okay? So y'all take the perimeter.

13:40.546 --> 13:41.911
You cover the back,
and we got the apartment.

13:41.946 --> 13:42.912
Let's roll.

13:46.751 --> 13:49.218
Chicago PD. Open up!

13:49.253 --> 13:51.053
Yeah?

13:51.088 --> 13:52.488
You all alone?

13:52.523 --> 13:54.089
Is there anyone else in there with you?

13:54.124 --> 13:55.491
No, I'm... I'm by myself.
But why are you...

13:55.526 --> 13:57.059
Okay, well, ma'am, we're gonna have

13:57.094 --> 13:58.194
to step inside and ask you
a few questions.

13:58.229 --> 14:00.229
It's very important, okay?

14:00.264 --> 14:02.964
Thank you. Step back, please.

14:06.537 --> 14:07.736
Clear.

14:07.771 --> 14:09.370
Clear.

14:09.406 --> 14:11.039
All right, we're clear in here, guys.

14:11.075 --> 14:12.540
- Copy that.
- See?

14:12.576 --> 14:14.042
No one else is here.

14:14.078 --> 14:15.744
Can you tell me
what the hell is going on?

14:15.779 --> 14:17.045
An offender wanted for murder

14:17.081 --> 14:18.246
was driving your car this morning.

14:18.281 --> 14:20.048
Car registered to this address.

14:20.084 --> 14:21.449
Maybe you can explain.

14:21.484 --> 14:22.784
I sure can.

14:22.820 --> 14:24.385
My car was stolen last night.

14:24.421 --> 14:27.689
I filed the police report
literally two hours ago.

14:29.292 --> 14:30.892
Case number's right there.

14:30.928 --> 14:33.061
Okay, we understand. Sorry about this.

14:33.097 --> 14:34.295
You don't know anything
about what happened

14:34.331 --> 14:36.231
at the old seminary this morning?

14:36.266 --> 14:38.899
All I heard was, some people got shot

14:38.935 --> 14:41.603
because the police screwed up.

14:42.606 --> 14:44.138
You'll notice how they give

14:44.173 --> 14:45.206
these buildings prestigious names.

14:45.242 --> 14:46.441
All right, Royal Towers,

14:46.476 --> 14:49.244
Queen's Gardens, Sunset Vista.

14:49.279 --> 14:50.878
- Pay attention, dog.
- Yeah.

14:50.913 --> 14:53.013
It's hilarious. Hey.

14:54.016 --> 14:55.650
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

14:55.685 --> 14:57.451
Mm-hmm.

14:57.954 --> 14:58.986
Excuse me.

14:59.021 --> 15:01.122
Excuse me.

15:01.157 --> 15:02.656
Mind if we talk to you?

15:02.691 --> 15:04.225
About what?

15:04.260 --> 15:05.926
There was an incident this morning

15:05.962 --> 15:07.294
at the old seminary.

15:07.329 --> 15:08.796
I don't know nothing about that.

15:08.831 --> 15:09.997
All right, then you shouldn't mind

15:10.032 --> 15:11.098
if we ask you a few questions.

15:11.134 --> 15:12.133
I should, and I do.

15:12.168 --> 15:13.934
Stop walking.

15:18.373 --> 15:20.306
Step away from the child.
Get on your knees.

15:20.341 --> 15:22.575
Keep your hands where I can see them.

15:22.610 --> 15:25.278
I'm not getting on my knees
for you or for nobody.

15:25.313 --> 15:27.012
Do not reach in your pocket.

15:27.047 --> 15:30.115
It's a phone.
I want my son to record this.

15:32.654 --> 15:34.287
Sir, do not reach in your pocket.

15:34.322 --> 15:36.355
Or what? You gonna shoot me?

15:36.391 --> 15:38.658
Kill me in front of my son over a phone?

15:39.160 --> 15:41.125
- I'm not gonna ask you again.
- Hey, hey, hey.

15:41.161 --> 15:43.295
Simple question.

15:43.330 --> 15:45.029
- Did you get shot today?
- What?

15:45.064 --> 15:46.331
Answer the question, yes or no.

15:46.366 --> 15:47.766
Did you get shot today?

15:47.801 --> 15:48.800
- No, man.
- All right.

15:48.835 --> 15:49.967
Just lift up your shirt.

15:50.003 --> 15:51.636
What the hell are you even...

15:51.672 --> 15:53.137
Lift up your shirt nice
and slow, just a few inches.

15:53.173 --> 15:54.673
Come on, man.

15:58.345 --> 16:03.013
I'm about to lift
my shirt up for this officer.

16:03.048 --> 16:06.116
I hope somebody's got
a phone to record this.

16:16.195 --> 16:18.395
Okay. Okay.

16:18.431 --> 16:21.465
We straight. You're good to go.

16:21.500 --> 16:23.866
Sorry about the misunderstanding.

16:23.901 --> 16:25.167
All right?

16:25.203 --> 16:28.070
All right, little man?

16:28.105 --> 16:30.139
Sorry about that.

16:32.009 --> 16:33.543
All right?

16:37.549 --> 16:39.582
We got a PR nightmare on our hands.

16:39.617 --> 16:42.518
Well, the optics weren't good
when the gangbanger

16:42.554 --> 16:44.386
was the shooter, let alone a white cop.

16:44.421 --> 16:46.020
Look, given the time constraints,

16:46.056 --> 16:47.556
we did everything we could.

16:47.591 --> 16:49.424
Help us understand why you were engaged

16:49.460 --> 16:51.760
in a dangerous operation
so close to a day care center.

16:51.795 --> 16:54.696
An illegal day care center.
We had no idea it was there.

16:54.732 --> 16:56.365
Well, you should have.

16:57.133 --> 16:58.881
Your men need to understand the culture

16:58.906 --> 17:00.235
of the neighborhoods they police.

17:00.270 --> 17:02.170
Places like that are common
in urban areas.

17:02.205 --> 17:04.204
Detective Halstead was under attack.

17:04.241 --> 17:07.376
He drew down on a suspect.
He fired one round.

17:07.411 --> 17:09.042
The bullet went through the suspect,

17:09.079 --> 17:11.679
then through a piece of wood,
and then hit the little girl.

17:11.714 --> 17:13.079
Well, I talked to ISP.

17:13.105 --> 17:14.799
They got one hit of DNA

17:14.824 --> 17:16.858
on the bullet that hit
the little girl... hers.

17:16.883 --> 17:18.315
Yeah, but it still
could have hit the offender.

17:18.351 --> 17:19.817
Bullets don't always collect DNA.

17:19.853 --> 17:22.185
But you already know that,
which tells me...

17:22.221 --> 17:24.722
Which tells you

17:24.757 --> 17:27.925
we're taking this very seriously.

17:31.531 --> 17:33.063
Hey, Kev, you know, before...

17:33.099 --> 17:36.000
that guy and his kid...
I was just doing my job, right?

17:36.035 --> 17:37.501
I'm questioning a murder suspect.

17:37.536 --> 17:39.569
He's noncompliant,
puts his hands in his pockets?

17:39.605 --> 17:41.372
- Come on.
- I mean, he got noncompliant

17:41.407 --> 17:43.040
because you were a little
belligerent, that's all.

17:43.075 --> 17:44.475
It's okay.

17:44.510 --> 17:46.076
All right, well, you know what?

17:46.112 --> 17:48.345
Next time, I'm gonna offer him
a blueberry scone.

17:48.381 --> 17:50.280
Dog, I...

17:51.384 --> 17:53.484
Look, bottom line is, it's not easy

17:53.519 --> 17:56.220
for a black man to get
on his knees for a white cop,

17:56.255 --> 17:57.521
especially with his son
right there, so...

17:57.556 --> 17:59.923
What if he was the offender

17:59.958 --> 18:04.427
and I'm out there soft-pedaling,
being all politically correct,

18:04.462 --> 18:06.830
and I take two to the chest or you do?

18:06.865 --> 18:08.532
What then?

18:08.567 --> 18:10.700
No, I'm not gonna let that happen.

18:10.736 --> 18:12.702
In this situation, I think it's better

18:12.738 --> 18:15.572
to ask for forgiveness than permission.

18:22.213 --> 18:23.746
Hey, man.

18:23.781 --> 18:26.382
How'd the interview
with the shooting team go?

18:26.418 --> 18:28.784
I'm not sure. It was pretty short.

18:28.819 --> 18:31.521
They didn't ask me too many questions.

18:32.623 --> 18:34.057
Okay.

18:34.092 --> 18:35.291
Jay.

18:35.326 --> 18:38.393
How you doing?

18:38.429 --> 18:40.362
I'm just trying to stay positive.

18:40.397 --> 18:41.897
Um, I was at the hospital earlier,

18:41.933 --> 18:43.732
and my brother said
there's a good chance

18:43.768 --> 18:46.268
- the little girl's gonna be...
- Oh, you didn't hear?

18:48.940 --> 18:49.972
She died, Jay.

18:50.007 --> 18:52.074
It's all over the news.

18:56.280 --> 18:58.547
Okay.

19:00.451 --> 19:01.717
I was just about to call you.

19:01.752 --> 19:03.218
You said she was gonna make it.

19:03.253 --> 19:04.652
- Hey.
- You said she was gonna...

19:04.688 --> 19:07.422
Hey, I said she had a chance, okay?

19:07.458 --> 19:10.292
She was in bad shape,
lost too much blood.

19:10.327 --> 19:11.442
I know.

19:11.467 --> 19:14.692
- There's only so much we can do.
- I know. I'm sorry. I just...

19:26.633 --> 19:28.765
Hey. Any luck with the gang unit?

19:28.790 --> 19:30.648
No. We looked through
lots of photos, but...

19:30.673 --> 19:32.264
These bangers must be
new to this clique.

19:32.289 --> 19:34.762
It's been eight hours.
We still got no lead on the shooter?

19:34.787 --> 19:35.998
I got something.

19:36.022 --> 19:38.449
I dumped the biker's phone,
found two texts to a burner

19:38.474 --> 19:40.634
discussing a deal for some thumpers.

19:40.659 --> 19:42.583
Recipient's name is Lil GG.

19:42.629 --> 19:44.128
May be one of our shooters.

19:44.164 --> 19:46.201
- Track the burner?
- Yeah, to a mini mart

19:46.226 --> 19:47.599
about three blocks from the crime scene.

19:47.634 --> 19:49.801
Good. You two.

19:51.805 --> 19:54.172
Excuse me. Hey.

19:54.208 --> 19:55.740
Looking for someone
who bought a phone here.

19:55.775 --> 19:57.559
His nickname's Lil GG.

19:57.584 --> 19:58.988
Don't know anyone with that name.

19:59.013 --> 20:01.111
Well, he's affiliated
with one of the local gangs...

20:01.146 --> 20:02.779
Southside Hawks.

20:02.815 --> 20:04.682
Guessing they buy a lot of burners.

20:04.717 --> 20:06.317
Ring any bells?

20:06.352 --> 20:09.286
No, nothing? Come on, man, help me out.

20:09.322 --> 20:12.022
I told you, I don't know them.

20:12.057 --> 20:13.657
All right.

20:13.693 --> 20:15.659
Well, I'm gonna need
your video surveillance.

20:15.695 --> 20:17.127
Not necessary.

20:17.162 --> 20:18.528
I screwed up. We're at the wrong store.

20:18.563 --> 20:20.496
Sorry for the inconvenience.

20:20.532 --> 20:22.232
Thank you.

20:25.003 --> 20:27.370
It's really best
if you get out of here, Jay.

20:27.405 --> 20:30.273
I was told I could work desk duty.

20:30.308 --> 20:32.175
Sarge, caught a break at the mini mart.

20:32.211 --> 20:33.810
The owner's wife knows Lil GG.

20:33.846 --> 20:35.178
His real name's Calvin Shaw.

20:35.214 --> 20:37.180
Get an address and an arrest warrant.

20:37.216 --> 20:38.815
- It's already done.
- Good.

20:38.851 --> 20:40.315
All right, you two go
with Ruzek and Upton.

20:40.351 --> 20:41.516
Yep.

20:41.552 --> 20:43.318
Let's pay this Lil GG a visit.

20:43.354 --> 20:45.287
We got you.

20:45.322 --> 20:47.689
Hey.

20:47.725 --> 20:48.690
Go home.

20:48.726 --> 20:50.359
Yeah.

20:51.428 --> 20:52.694
Hey, Sarge,

20:52.730 --> 20:54.130
have you heard from Lindsay?

20:54.165 --> 20:56.698
Nope. You?

20:56.734 --> 20:58.400
I left her a message.

20:58.435 --> 21:00.369
I didn't hear back.

21:00.404 --> 21:02.204
Probably on assignment.

21:06.210 --> 21:08.476
She's not coming back, is she?

21:09.379 --> 21:11.246
Look, it was time for her to move on.

21:11.281 --> 21:13.714
It just was.

21:13.750 --> 21:15.516
You need to make peace with it.

21:37.039 --> 21:39.840
- Go.
- Chicago PD!

21:39.875 --> 21:41.074
Stairs!

21:45.815 --> 21:47.380
Got a body!

21:47.416 --> 21:48.581
All right, crossing.

21:55.090 --> 21:57.723
- Clear.
- Got two to the head.

21:57.758 --> 21:59.192
What about the stomach?

22:06.100 --> 22:09.035
DOA is Calvin Shaw, AKA Lil GG.

22:09.070 --> 22:11.070
Two bullet wounds to the head,
none to the abdomen,

22:11.105 --> 22:14.073
so he's not the guy
Halstead shot, unfortunately.

22:14.108 --> 22:16.542
It sounds like Lil GG's
partner got nervous.

22:16.577 --> 22:18.077
maybe blamed him for the CI leak.

22:18.112 --> 22:19.745
- Maybe.
- Follow up with Ballistics.

22:19.780 --> 22:21.747
I was going over the evidence
from Lil GG's place.

22:21.782 --> 22:23.114
There's a text message between him

22:23.150 --> 22:24.883
and the guy who got shot at the scene...

22:24.918 --> 22:26.885
James Pell, the guy
who won't talk to us.

22:26.920 --> 22:28.286
Well, now we know why.

22:28.322 --> 22:30.255
Get his ass down here right now.

22:30.290 --> 22:32.391
- Kev, you wanna come?
- Yep.

22:36.295 --> 22:38.028
James Pell?

22:41.768 --> 22:43.568
We've been trying to talk to you.

22:43.603 --> 22:46.971
Like I told the other cops,
I'm in pain from the shooting

22:47.006 --> 22:48.439
and focused on my recovery.

22:48.475 --> 22:50.775
You were treated
and released in 15 minutes.

22:50.810 --> 22:53.277
I believe the world's record is ten.

22:53.312 --> 22:55.446
How much pain could you be in?

22:55.482 --> 22:59.049
I got nothing to say.

23:01.153 --> 23:05.356
Look we just wanna talk
about your friend Lil GG.

23:05.392 --> 23:08.157
I don't know anybody by that name.

23:08.193 --> 23:09.793
You were texting him this morning

23:09.828 --> 23:14.330
right before that shoot-out
at the seminary.

23:14.366 --> 23:17.033
I want a lawyer.

23:17.068 --> 23:18.502
Now.

23:21.673 --> 23:22.939
You deaf?

23:27.178 --> 23:30.647
I said I want a damn lawyer.

23:30.682 --> 23:32.315
So go.

23:32.350 --> 23:34.484
Get out.

23:52.770 --> 23:55.037
Alvin, this is Alderman Price.

23:55.072 --> 23:56.672
Oh, I know who he is.

23:56.707 --> 23:58.841
Yeah, nice to see you again,
Detective Olinsky.

23:58.876 --> 24:00.342
Is James Pell in there?

24:00.377 --> 24:01.877
I'm sorry. You are...

24:01.913 --> 24:03.512
He's the guy I was telling you about.

24:03.548 --> 24:05.013
Oh.

24:05.049 --> 24:06.348
Yeah, he's back there.

24:06.383 --> 24:08.683
- Has he been arrested?
- Nope.

24:08.718 --> 24:11.920
Then I suggest you release him.

24:11.956 --> 24:13.355
You know, I heard you were a politician.

24:13.390 --> 24:15.190
I didn't realize you were a lawyer too.

24:15.225 --> 24:18.026
You don't have to go
to law school to see that

24:18.062 --> 24:20.929
the Chicago PD is once again
harassing an innocent man.

24:20.965 --> 24:22.197
He's free to go.

24:22.232 --> 24:24.099
Oh, thank you, Detective, uh...

24:24.134 --> 24:25.934
Actually, it's Sergeant. Voight.

24:25.970 --> 24:27.936
Voight. Ray Price. Nice to meet you.

24:27.972 --> 24:31.606
Now, I understand that
your unit is under pressure

24:31.641 --> 24:34.375
for the unfortunate incident
that happened at the seminary.

24:34.410 --> 24:37.545
- And I sympathize with that.
- Mm.

24:37.581 --> 24:40.414
But do not harass

24:40.450 --> 24:43.852
the hardworking men and women
of my ward.

24:43.887 --> 24:45.787
That is a hell of a speech, Ray.

24:45.822 --> 24:47.388
It's too bad the cameras
weren't rolling.

24:47.423 --> 24:49.390
Oh, they will be soon enough.

24:49.425 --> 24:52.426
- Hmm.
- Trust me on that.

24:53.597 --> 24:56.397
Al, why don't you
show these gentlemen back?

24:59.402 --> 25:00.734
Thanks for your help, Sergeant.

25:00.769 --> 25:02.035
Yeah.

25:02.070 --> 25:03.871
This guy.

25:03.906 --> 25:06.106
Hey, you guys talk to Halstead lately?

25:06.141 --> 25:07.741
A few hours ago. What's up?

25:07.776 --> 25:10.243
Well, as the kids say,
he is blowing up the Internet,

25:10.278 --> 25:12.078
and not in a good way.

25:12.114 --> 25:14.648
"Child killer is racist too."

25:14.683 --> 25:16.082
Racist? What?

25:16.118 --> 25:17.618
Here's another: "Racist cop punched

25:17.653 --> 25:20.220
African American Cop for no reason."

25:20.255 --> 25:22.122
No, no, no, no, no,
that guy was harassing Lindsay.

25:22.157 --> 25:23.823
He sent her a bunch of perverted texts.

25:23.858 --> 25:26.092
Wow, that didn't take long.

25:26.128 --> 25:28.461
"The ACLU and NAACP are now demanding

25:28.497 --> 25:32.065
that Chicago PD fire Halstead."

25:32.100 --> 25:34.667
Are you serious?

26:11.004 --> 26:13.638
Now, that's how you smoke brisket.

26:13.674 --> 26:15.373
Thanks for coming down, Hank.

26:15.408 --> 26:17.108
- That's good.
- Yeah.

26:17.143 --> 26:18.509
Has a little of that Cajun kick to it.

26:18.545 --> 26:20.211
Hmm.

26:20.246 --> 26:22.814
Ah, I didn't mean to be

26:22.849 --> 26:25.215
so confrontational today.

26:25.250 --> 26:27.651
But the truth is, you and me,

26:27.687 --> 26:28.852
we're on the same team.

26:28.888 --> 26:31.121
Yeah, how do you figure that?

26:31.156 --> 26:33.490
Well, we both love this city,

26:33.525 --> 26:37.027
and we both would do anything
to protect its citizens.

26:37.063 --> 26:39.129
Unless, of course, you're a cop

26:39.164 --> 26:41.765
and you accidentally shoot a kid.

26:43.035 --> 26:44.834
You know all those headlines today,

26:44.869 --> 26:47.336
accusations of racism?

26:47.371 --> 26:50.139
See, I'm guessing that's you.

26:50.174 --> 26:52.208
Sure is.

26:54.779 --> 26:56.079
You know, Halstead...

26:56.114 --> 26:57.546
you know, he seems like a good cop.

26:57.582 --> 26:58.581
Good guy too.

26:58.617 --> 26:59.716
Hell, I had five people

26:59.751 --> 27:01.217
digging in his ass all day.

27:01.252 --> 27:02.684
The only negative thing
they could find was

27:02.720 --> 27:05.887
a fistfight he had
with some degenerate black cop.

27:05.923 --> 27:07.522
Oh, thank you.

27:07.557 --> 27:10.558
This is made right here,
five miles away.

27:10.594 --> 27:12.861
- Hmm.
- Black owned, black financed.

27:12.896 --> 27:14.229
Bourbon is damn good too.

27:14.264 --> 27:17.532
100% corn. That's why it's so sweet.

27:17.567 --> 27:20.435
So we come down here to drink bourbon?

27:20.470 --> 27:22.537
No.

27:22.572 --> 27:23.938
We came here to solve the problem...

27:23.973 --> 27:26.774
- you and me.
- Okay.

27:26.809 --> 27:28.876
Somebody has to pay
for that little girl.

27:28.911 --> 27:30.611
Mm-hmm.

27:30.647 --> 27:32.279
And all the other little boys and girls

27:32.314 --> 27:35.449
and the police shootings
and the ass whuppings.

27:35.484 --> 27:37.584
More than ever, this city
needs someone to blame,

27:37.620 --> 27:41.355
and that person is a young,
good-looking white cop

27:41.390 --> 27:44.391
named Jay Halstead.

27:44.426 --> 27:46.793
And you want me to help?

27:46.828 --> 27:48.227
No.

27:48.263 --> 27:50.396
I want you to get the hell
out of the way.

27:56.604 --> 27:58.672
Wow, that really is good.

28:01.810 --> 28:03.777
Thanks for the drink.

28:22.408 --> 28:23.976
Easy. Just relax.

28:24.077 --> 28:27.412
- Man, what the hell are you...
- Just relax. I'm here as a friend.

28:27.447 --> 28:29.248
- I got enough friends.
- Yeah.

28:29.283 --> 28:32.351
Well, none that can get you out
from under a murder rap.

28:32.729 --> 28:33.961
A murder rap?

28:34.044 --> 28:35.344
You were lookout in a gun deal

28:35.380 --> 28:37.412
where two innocent people were killed.

28:37.447 --> 28:39.815
That's felony murder, my man.

28:39.850 --> 28:41.483
As a friend,

28:41.518 --> 28:43.351
I can convince the state's attorney

28:43.387 --> 28:44.820
to charge you with a lesser crime.

28:44.855 --> 28:46.554
You don't have enough

28:46.590 --> 28:48.190
to charge me with jaywalking.

28:48.225 --> 28:50.159
Well, not yet.

28:50.194 --> 28:52.360
But we will.

28:53.297 --> 28:57.699
Look, you help me,
I'll return the favor.

28:57.734 --> 29:00.368
If you don't,

29:00.404 --> 29:02.004
I'll convince the state's attorney

29:02.039 --> 29:04.706
you're the mastermind, mm.

29:04.741 --> 29:07.242
Yeah, you're the one responsible
for the murder of that woman

29:07.278 --> 29:08.944
and the little girl.

29:15.219 --> 29:17.719
What do you need?

29:17.754 --> 29:20.221
All right, one more time, just for fun.

29:20.256 --> 29:23.291
The two dead bikers are
Anthony Jonas and Mike Scola,

29:23.326 --> 29:25.025
my younger brother, and we're from Gary.

29:25.060 --> 29:27.461
We deal meth and guns.
You and I met in Branchville.

29:27.496 --> 29:28.895
You were in for armed robbery.

29:28.931 --> 29:30.230
I was doing time for aggravated assault.

29:30.265 --> 29:31.799
And we're here...

29:31.834 --> 29:33.434
To get compensated
for what happened the other day.

29:33.469 --> 29:35.235
- All right.
- This is gonna be fun.

29:36.405 --> 29:37.705
Listen, Marcus.

29:37.740 --> 29:39.873
I lost $40,000 worth of guns,

29:39.908 --> 29:42.576
a friend named Tony Jonas,
and my little brother Mike.

29:42.611 --> 29:44.545
That shoot-out really cost us.

29:44.580 --> 29:47.213
Sorry, bro, but I don't know
anything about no guns.

29:47.248 --> 29:48.481
Really?

29:48.516 --> 29:49.915
'Cause my brother said he was dealing

29:49.951 --> 29:52.952
directly with you
and a friend named Lil GG.

29:52.987 --> 29:56.255
You must got me confused
with someone else.

29:57.592 --> 29:58.791
If you're gonna lie, Marcus,

29:58.827 --> 30:00.460
why did you even take the meeting?

30:00.495 --> 30:02.495
'Cause I wanna do some new business.

30:02.530 --> 30:04.430
I need heaters.

30:04.466 --> 30:06.131
So why don't we leave
the past in the past

30:06.167 --> 30:07.667
and we just talk about the present?

30:07.702 --> 30:09.402
'Cause my man Pell
said you ready to deal.

30:09.437 --> 30:10.570
Not yet.

30:10.605 --> 30:12.438
We still got business to do.

30:12.474 --> 30:15.274
I rapped with one
of your boys yesterday.

30:15.309 --> 30:17.343
A dude named Harold.

30:17.378 --> 30:19.945
Said you got a lot of guns to sell me.

30:19.981 --> 30:22.314
- You know Harold?
- I know I'm here to talk...

30:22.350 --> 30:26.085
Do you know Harold, yes or no, bro?

30:26.120 --> 30:27.419
My little brother was killed

30:27.454 --> 30:29.421
because you got a leak in your crew.

30:29.456 --> 30:31.290
You're gonna question whether I'm legit,

30:31.325 --> 30:32.992
make up some dude named Harold?

30:35.129 --> 30:36.362
What you looking at, cuz?

30:36.397 --> 30:37.796
Who the hell you talking to, fam?

30:37.831 --> 30:39.531
Talking business. Why don't you...

30:39.566 --> 30:40.966
Wasn't nobody talking to your white ass,

30:41.002 --> 30:43.035
- so you can shut up.
- My white ass?

30:43.070 --> 30:44.869
- I'm talking to this clown...
- Man, who you calling a clown?

30:48.574 --> 30:50.441
Are you serious? Why I gotta go?

30:50.476 --> 30:51.776
I ain't even do...

30:51.811 --> 30:53.278
Okay, I'm outside. I'm outside.

30:53.313 --> 30:54.678
I'll see you there!

30:54.714 --> 30:56.814
- Right here.
- You're good. Calm down.

30:56.849 --> 30:58.716
- You good? You good?
- Yeah.

30:58.751 --> 31:01.052
I just don't like when people
interfere with business,

31:01.087 --> 31:02.353
you know what I mean?

31:02.389 --> 31:05.456
It's all good. It's okay, man.
I understand.

31:05.491 --> 31:06.690
So how we gonna do this?

31:06.726 --> 31:08.459
Easy way or the other way?

31:08.494 --> 31:10.127
Hey, look.

31:10.162 --> 31:12.663
I'm sorry about your brother
and the other dude,

31:12.698 --> 31:16.801
but I don't know anything
about no guns and no money.

31:16.836 --> 31:19.470
The best thing I can do
is just offer $1,000.

31:19.505 --> 31:21.004
For two lives

31:21.040 --> 31:23.140
and 40 grand worth of merchandise?

31:25.411 --> 31:26.977
Hey, look.

31:27.012 --> 31:29.313
It was crazy for me too.

31:29.348 --> 31:31.014
I almost lost my life.

31:31.050 --> 31:34.651
Cops rolled up. Bullets started flying.

31:34.686 --> 31:37.854
The whole thing was just a mess.

31:49.534 --> 31:51.000
I appreciate your honesty, Marcus.

31:51.035 --> 31:52.068
$1,000 it is.

32:04.381 --> 32:05.581
Great job, bro.

32:05.616 --> 32:07.015
Thanks, the wire good?

32:07.050 --> 32:09.585
Perfect.

32:09.620 --> 32:11.052
- It's been a while.
- Yeah.

32:11.088 --> 32:12.588
- Thanks for helping out.
- Sure thing.

32:12.623 --> 32:13.856
You know, maybe I should stick around

32:13.891 --> 32:15.557
and help you bust this punk too.

32:15.593 --> 32:16.959
I'm on loan. Might as well
get your money's worth.

32:16.994 --> 32:18.293
Sounds great.

32:18.328 --> 32:19.927
Hailey Upton.

32:19.963 --> 32:21.562
Hey, nice to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

32:21.598 --> 32:23.231
Sorry about that, man.

32:23.266 --> 32:24.632
- No, it's okay. I get it.
- No, no, no.

32:24.667 --> 32:26.368
- No, it was the right move.
- He was reaching for his gun.

32:26.403 --> 32:28.103
All right, listen up.

32:28.138 --> 32:30.438
First we get a warrant.
Then we grab Marcus.

32:30.474 --> 32:33.074
Let's go.

32:33.110 --> 32:34.142
Good job.

33:08.444 --> 33:09.644
Hey.

33:09.679 --> 33:11.110
- Come on.
- Come on, get up.

33:11.146 --> 33:12.679
- You don't wanna do that.
- Let's go.

33:12.714 --> 33:14.080
Come on, you ain't got nothing

33:14.115 --> 33:15.415
better to do than running in my crib?

33:15.450 --> 33:16.917
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey.

33:16.952 --> 33:18.919
You're under arrest, man.
Shut your ass up.

33:18.954 --> 33:21.487
Damn, bro.

33:21.523 --> 33:22.689
Hey, how you doing, Marcus?

33:22.724 --> 33:23.790
Bro.

33:23.825 --> 33:24.991
Don't look at me like that.

33:25.027 --> 33:26.426
What's this?

33:26.461 --> 33:27.861
Oh, my goodness.

33:27.896 --> 33:29.262
Where'd you get that, playing polo?

33:29.297 --> 33:31.431
- Lawyer.
- Lawyer?

33:31.466 --> 33:33.433
- Stand him up.
- I need my lawyer.

33:33.468 --> 33:35.001
Truth is, you're lucky.

33:36.571 --> 33:38.371
'Cause if you didn't have
that bullet wound,

33:38.406 --> 33:41.074
I was gonna shoot you myself.

33:44.383 --> 33:46.650
Through and through.
Lower left side of the abdomen.

33:46.685 --> 33:48.953
Just like Halstead said.

33:49.476 --> 33:51.087
So he's right.

33:51.656 --> 33:53.784
About shooting Marcus Kelly, anyway.

33:54.259 --> 33:56.860
Doesn't make it good police work.

33:57.529 --> 34:00.075
There were five children in
the day care center, 15 feet...

34:00.100 --> 34:01.862
Are we really still talking about

34:01.887 --> 34:03.700
that illegal day care center, sir?

34:03.960 --> 34:06.461
A little girl is dead.

34:06.496 --> 34:10.164
15 .45-caliber rounds were
fired in Halstead's direction.

34:10.199 --> 34:12.100
A woman... a woman standing

34:12.135 --> 34:14.735
20 feet away from him was killed.

34:14.771 --> 34:16.637
If you're teaching a class
at the academy

34:16.672 --> 34:18.773
on how to handle
this situation, you'd say,

34:18.808 --> 34:21.442
"Do it the way Halstead did it."

34:22.879 --> 34:25.112
There's a lot of pressure
on this one, Hank...

34:25.148 --> 34:26.781
from up high.

34:27.817 --> 34:31.152
Yeah, I'm sort of getting that feeling.

34:31.187 --> 34:34.655
I imagine you already heard
we arrested Marcus Kelly.

34:34.690 --> 34:37.458
Yeah, got him on tape
talking about the gun deal.

34:37.493 --> 34:39.025
Found the murder weapon too.

34:39.062 --> 34:40.293
Yeah, I read about that.

34:40.329 --> 34:43.697
You read about it?

34:43.733 --> 34:45.266
Huh.

34:45.301 --> 34:49.168
Yeah, I felt sure he would
have called you directly.

34:49.204 --> 34:50.603
Excuse me?

34:56.844 --> 34:59.946
Yeah, found this on his phone.

34:59.982 --> 35:02.115
- Doesn't surprise me.
- Hmm.

35:02.151 --> 35:03.650
I've known him for years.

35:03.685 --> 35:06.552
His gang donates to my campaign.

35:06.588 --> 35:08.822
But, uh, you already know that, huh?

35:08.857 --> 35:11.291
You already talked to Marcus about me,

35:11.326 --> 35:13.526
- our relationship.
- Yes, I did.

35:13.561 --> 35:17.230
Truth is, I don't have a choice.

35:17.266 --> 35:18.832
Oh.

35:18.867 --> 35:21.034
Rich white folks aren't
pouring cash into this war.

35:21.069 --> 35:22.335
Mm.

35:22.370 --> 35:23.904
So I need to do what I need to do

35:23.939 --> 35:26.206
to save the people around here
who want to be saved.

35:26.241 --> 35:27.841
It's just a part of doing business.

35:27.876 --> 35:29.708
Hmm.

35:29.743 --> 35:33.145
The Southside Hawks donated
$200 grand to this place.

35:33.181 --> 35:34.980
- Really? Wow.
- Yeah.

35:35.016 --> 35:36.849
It's a place where, as we speak,

35:36.884 --> 35:40.085
kids are playing basketball,
learning how to read,

35:40.121 --> 35:42.154
using the computers.

35:42.190 --> 35:45.057
Without the big, bad, evil gang,

35:45.092 --> 35:46.826
this doesn't get built.

35:46.861 --> 35:50.196
Hmm. I get it.

35:50.231 --> 35:53.064
I really do. I get it.

35:53.099 --> 35:54.165
But I'll tell you what.

35:54.201 --> 35:56.401
Most people won't.

35:56.437 --> 35:58.570
I mean, a picture like this...

35:58.605 --> 36:00.672
this kind of thing gets out,
I mean, arm in arm

36:00.708 --> 36:02.708
with a murderer, child killer?

36:02.743 --> 36:07.111
I mean, it's the kind of thing
people don't forget.

36:07.147 --> 36:10.615
Make it real hard
for you to do business,

36:10.651 --> 36:13.084
to help the people of your ward.

36:15.421 --> 36:17.788
What's your proposal?

36:17.824 --> 36:20.091
Just back off Halstead.

36:21.127 --> 36:23.061
I can do that,

36:23.096 --> 36:26.231
if you back off Pell.

36:26.266 --> 36:27.866
Pell, the lookout?

36:29.936 --> 36:31.435
He's more than that.

36:31.471 --> 36:35.406
He's the brains of the whole crew.

36:35.441 --> 36:37.742
He doesn't deal drugs, shoot people.

36:37.777 --> 36:39.410
He focuses on making money.

36:39.445 --> 36:41.079
So I need him out there on the street

36:41.114 --> 36:44.214
making sure that
the cash flow continues.

36:44.250 --> 36:46.316
Mm.

36:46.352 --> 36:48.718
And Marcus?

36:50.455 --> 36:52.555
Bury his ass.

37:05.971 --> 37:07.570
Alderman.

37:08.307 --> 37:10.340
Hank.

37:14.345 --> 37:15.978
Morgan Williams' senseless death

37:16.014 --> 37:19.115
has caused this city great distress

37:19.150 --> 37:21.617
and pain.

37:21.652 --> 37:25.254
And as a result,
we've gone to great lengths

37:25.290 --> 37:27.623
to find someone to blame,

37:27.658 --> 37:29.258
someone to hate.

37:29.294 --> 37:33.295
And no one has wanted
to hate Detective Halstead

37:33.330 --> 37:35.631
more than me.

37:35.666 --> 37:37.800
But the more I learned

37:37.835 --> 37:40.803
about what actually
transpired that morning,

37:40.838 --> 37:42.604
the more I'm convinced
Detective Halstead

37:42.640 --> 37:43.672
did nothing wrong.

37:43.707 --> 37:46.174
In fact, his actions

37:46.209 --> 37:49.277
saved several lives...

37:49.313 --> 37:51.146
several black lives.

37:51.181 --> 37:52.614
- Excuse me.
- We really want to...

37:52.650 --> 37:54.649
Nice try.

37:54.684 --> 37:57.117
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

37:57.153 --> 38:00.120
- I'll see you around, Hank.
- Mm-hmm.

38:04.160 --> 38:05.493
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:05.528 --> 38:07.127
Sorry, I got here as fast as I could.

38:07.163 --> 38:09.129
It's over?

38:09.165 --> 38:11.131
Yeah, just ended.

38:11.167 --> 38:13.667
How'd it go?

38:13.702 --> 38:16.470
It was good. Really good, actually.

38:16.505 --> 38:19.739
Price was very gracious.

38:19.775 --> 38:22.175
I'm not really sure
what prompted all this, but...

38:22.210 --> 38:24.811
Hey, take yes for an answer.

38:28.049 --> 38:32.185
If there's anything you need,
please let me know.

38:32.220 --> 38:33.653
I'll be okay eventually.

38:33.689 --> 38:36.022
I think I just gotta
make sense of all of it.

38:36.057 --> 38:38.691
Yeah. It's tough.

38:38.726 --> 38:40.326
Trust me.

38:42.230 --> 38:44.330
Have you...

38:44.366 --> 38:45.831
Yeah.

38:45.867 --> 38:48.167
Different circumstances, but...

38:52.740 --> 38:54.740
Talk to Morgan's mother yet?

38:55.877 --> 38:58.544
No. I don't think I'm ready.

38:58.579 --> 39:02.214
Oh, man. You're never gonna be ready.

39:02.249 --> 39:05.083
You just have to do it.

39:08.222 --> 39:11.790
<i>Detective Halstead
is not the man to blame...</i>

39:11.826 --> 39:13.291
Sounds like good news.

39:13.327 --> 39:16.629
<i>- Not the man to hate.</i>
- Yeah, yeah.

39:16.664 --> 39:18.230
Makes you think, though.

39:18.265 --> 39:19.899
I mean, Halstead's just doing his job,

39:19.934 --> 39:21.567
he almost gets killed, for God sakes,

39:21.602 --> 39:25.037
and they try their best
to throw him under the bus.

39:25.072 --> 39:26.738
It's a tough time to be a cop.

39:26.773 --> 39:28.706
In Chicago, anyway.

39:28.742 --> 39:30.108
Yeah, I'll drink to that.

39:30.144 --> 39:31.709
Wait, no.

39:31.745 --> 39:34.746
I say we drink
to something else instead.

39:34.781 --> 39:37.215
I agree. To Halstead.

39:37.251 --> 39:39.184
To Halstead.

39:43.357 --> 39:44.489
Kim, you want another beer?

39:44.525 --> 39:46.758
Uh, no, I'm good.

39:46.793 --> 39:48.093
Maybe later, we could, uh...

39:48.128 --> 39:49.094
No.

39:49.129 --> 39:51.163
It's just not a good idea.

39:51.198 --> 39:53.497
Well, I never said it was a good idea.

39:55.134 --> 39:57.634
I met someone.

39:58.504 --> 40:00.938
Oh, that's great.

40:00.973 --> 40:02.973
Hmm.

40:03.008 --> 40:05.309
You... you sure you don't
want another beer?

40:05.344 --> 40:06.743
I'm good.

40:06.779 --> 40:09.547
All right. Have a good night.

40:10.816 --> 40:13.684
The last time we had dinner,
you said you weren't too happy

40:13.719 --> 40:16.120
over at the state's attorney's office.

40:16.155 --> 40:18.989
Those long-tail investigations
get a little boring.

40:19.024 --> 40:22.158
Well, if you're looking
for a little more excitement,

40:22.194 --> 40:25.595
you're welcome back
in the unit full-time.

40:32.137 --> 40:33.636
Might have to juggle a few things,

40:33.671 --> 40:36.172
but that sounds great.

40:54.058 --> 40:56.759
I found Morgan's necklace.

41:02.700 --> 41:04.133
I wanted you to have it.

41:15.713 --> 41:18.117
I'm very sorry.
