WEBVTT

00:01.544 --> 00:03.922
Dark Army told me
stage two is ready.

00:04.255 --> 00:06.675
<i>I know he's dead.
I know this isn't real.</i>

00:06.758 --> 00:09.427
I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

00:09.594 --> 00:11.179
People have been
forging paper records.

00:11.262 --> 00:13.598
We haven't set up a system
to verify these
sorts of claims.

00:13.765 --> 00:17.769
Rebuilding our database
is the only solution
to this problem.

00:18.019 --> 00:21.189
Immunity is on the table
in exchange for a name.

00:21.356 --> 00:22.273
That's all I care about.

00:22.399 --> 00:23.566
<i>We have to talk to them.</i>

00:23.692 --> 00:25.193
<i>They can't do this
after what happened
last night.</i>

00:25.276 --> 00:27.195
<i>What, that some
Mexican restaurant
got shot up?</i>

00:27.278 --> 00:28.613
<i>We can't let them
get away with this.</i>

00:28.780 --> 00:30.073
They're going to
get away with this.

00:30.407 --> 00:32.117
Promise me you'll let me
do the interview.

00:32.200 --> 00:34.119
You've been
messing with me
for way too long.

00:34.244 --> 00:36.121
It's my birthday
gift to you.

00:41.876 --> 00:42.961
You know, of all
the gifts he sent,

00:43.086 --> 00:44.921
this is the greatest
we ever received.

00:45.630 --> 00:49.426
I have to know
what you're planning.
We were meant to be allies.

00:51.261 --> 00:54.806
We might just
want the same thing,
and I need to be involved.

00:55.306 --> 00:58.226
I am pretty positive
you're dead wrong
about that, my friend.

00:58.309 --> 01:00.979
I don't think there's anything
we could possibly agree on.

01:08.445 --> 01:10.113
Seems you've been
very busy lately.

01:14.325 --> 01:17.996
I have to know
what you're planning.
We were meant to be allies.

01:20.832 --> 01:24.669
We might just
want the same thing,
and I need to be involved.

01:24.794 --> 01:27.797
I'm pretty
positive you're dead wrong
about that, my friend.

01:28.673 --> 01:31.468
I don't think there's anything
we could possibly agree on.

01:32.927 --> 01:34.345
I don't know what
game you're playing,

01:34.429 --> 01:36.306
but I suggest you
cut the bullshit.

01:36.681 --> 01:38.641
If there's nothing else,
I think we're done here.

01:40.268 --> 01:43.271
Aren't you forgetting
that I know your
dirty little secret?

01:44.022 --> 01:45.190
There are people
close to you

01:45.315 --> 01:47.859
that wouldn't be happy if
they knew what I know.

01:54.199 --> 01:56.993
We're both too smart
to allow pettiness
to dictate our actions.

01:57.160 --> 01:58.286
We're better than that.

01:58.953 --> 02:02.373
Weigh the pros and cons.
Do what you need to do.

02:03.041 --> 02:04.876
As soon as
the tabulations are over with,

02:05.001 --> 02:06.878
you'll know that
telling anyone about this

02:06.961 --> 02:08.379
does neither one
of us any good.

02:09.130 --> 02:11.216
In fact, you'll
realize that the only thing

02:11.299 --> 02:13.718
to do in your position
when it comes to me

02:14.719 --> 02:16.012
is nothing.

02:25.897 --> 02:27.232
Elliot!

02:32.904 --> 02:36.658
I believe in fate.
There's a reason we met.

02:37.867 --> 02:40.245
There's something between us.
I can see it.

02:42.914 --> 02:45.083
You're only seeing
what's in front of you.

02:49.754 --> 02:51.756
You're not seeing
what's above you.

03:03.059 --> 03:07.480
I don't understand.
I want to. Help me understand.

03:18.491 --> 03:21.494
"So much depends
upon a red wheelbarrow

03:22.245 --> 03:26.583
"glazed with rainwater
beside the white chickens."

03:44.100 --> 03:46.769
My father used
to say that to me
all the time as a child.

03:48.354 --> 03:52.775
It was the only
English he knew.
Some silly poem.

03:54.819 --> 03:56.529
It meant very much to him.

04:01.701 --> 04:03.870
I use it as a reminder.

04:05.204 --> 04:08.875
A reminder of him
and a reminder

04:09.000 --> 04:10.793
of what I never
want to become.

06:08.453 --> 06:09.620
Go on.

06:37.148 --> 06:41.235
<i>How is the Dark Army
behind this, whatever this is?</i>

06:59.045 --> 07:01.422
<i>It's one thing
to question your mind.</i>

07:01.506 --> 07:03.925
<i>It's another to
question your eyes and ears.</i>

07:04.342 --> 07:06.636
<i>But then again,
isn't it all the same,</i>

07:06.719 --> 07:09.847
<i>our senses just
mediocre inputs for our brain?</i>

07:09.931 --> 07:11.099
Come on.

07:12.391 --> 07:14.185
<i>Sure, we rely on them,</i>

07:14.268 --> 07:17.355
<i>trust they accurately portray
the real world around us,</i>

07:17.438 --> 07:20.024
<i>but what if the haunting
truth is, they can't?</i>

07:20.358 --> 07:23.861
<i>That what we perceive
isn't the real world at all,</i>

07:23.945 --> 07:26.405
<i>but just our
mind's best guess?</i>

07:27.615 --> 07:30.451
<i>That all we really
have is a garbled reality,</i>

07:30.576 --> 07:33.412
<i>a fuzzy picture we will
never truly make out.</i>

07:35.373 --> 07:37.458
So this is where
you've been staying?

07:37.542 --> 07:39.794
God, no. We're only
operating from here.

07:40.545 --> 07:42.380
The Dark Army set this up?

07:43.214 --> 07:46.884
They're our partners.
Of course they set this up.
For us.

07:47.468 --> 07:49.220
We needed a discreet place.

07:49.929 --> 07:51.139
Discreet?

07:51.722 --> 07:53.391
You're the most
wanted man in the world

07:53.474 --> 07:55.476
and you're walking
around like that.

07:55.560 --> 07:57.812
You really don't
remember this, do you?

07:58.771 --> 08:00.940
<i>Because I'm not
the one who set this up.</i>

08:01.065 --> 08:02.817
We've been
through this already.

08:02.900 --> 08:05.903
<i>It must have been him.
Mr. Robot.</i>

08:11.659 --> 08:12.952
Elliot.

08:14.662 --> 08:18.749
I need to know.
Are you able to
handle this or not?

08:19.458 --> 08:22.837
You're here under great risk,
not only to me,
but to our plan.

08:23.421 --> 08:27.258
And your disposition
is very much concerning me.

08:30.428 --> 08:31.596
Joanna.

08:39.270 --> 08:40.438
Your wife.

08:42.315 --> 08:43.858
She's been looking for you.

08:46.485 --> 08:48.112
I'm doing what's necessary.

08:56.120 --> 08:59.040
Thank goodness
they've given us these UPSes
for the power surges.

09:03.294 --> 09:05.379
Ready to look at
what we accomplished?

09:37.161 --> 09:38.663
Wanna take
your jacket off, hon?

09:41.582 --> 09:43.000
Don't call me hon.

09:45.044 --> 09:47.672
I just meant you have
some blood on there.
I had some, too, on my shirt.

09:47.838 --> 09:50.258
I know what's on
my fucking jacket.

09:54.220 --> 09:55.304
I'm sorry for the loss...

09:55.388 --> 09:58.516
I invoke my Fifth
Amendment privilege
against self-incrimination

09:58.599 --> 10:01.185
and respectfully
decline to answer
any of your questions.

10:04.105 --> 10:05.481
I'm not asking a question.

10:05.773 --> 10:08.025
I just wanted to tell you
how sorry I am for the loss...

10:08.109 --> 10:11.070
I invoke my Fifth
Amendment privilege
against self-incrimination

10:11.153 --> 10:13.864
and respectfully
decline to answer
any of your questions.

10:15.658 --> 10:17.118
I know you guys were close.

10:19.370 --> 10:20.913
I'm sorry
you had to lose him.

10:23.249 --> 10:26.294
He was involved in
one of the most notorious
hacker rings in the world.

10:28.671 --> 10:30.798
Things like this
come with the territory.

10:31.924 --> 10:33.843
I invoke my Fifth
Amendment privilege

10:33.968 --> 10:35.886
against self-incrimination
and respectfully...

10:35.970 --> 10:37.680
You keep trying
to invoke the Fifth Amendment,

10:37.930 --> 10:40.141
but there's this thing
called the Patriot Act

10:40.224 --> 10:42.768
that a bunch of
people signed into law.

10:43.394 --> 10:44.687
Do you know
what that means?

10:45.730 --> 10:48.566
It means that you are
not on some TV show.

10:50.067 --> 10:51.694
This isn't <i>Burn Notice.</i>

10:52.611 --> 10:55.072
There are no blue skies
for you out there.

10:56.115 --> 10:59.660
Characters like you
are not welcome here.

11:00.369 --> 11:04.415
As far as anyone's
concerned right now,
you're an enemy combatant.

11:05.916 --> 11:07.960
You don't have any rights.

11:10.713 --> 11:12.548
What the fuck do you
want me to tell you?

11:13.758 --> 11:17.720
I meet my boyfriend.
We go eat. He gets shot.

11:18.721 --> 11:20.056
End of Q&A.

11:24.727 --> 11:25.936
Give me a sec.

11:40.701 --> 11:42.203
You're gonna
want to talk to me.

11:44.830 --> 11:46.082
We're not so different.

11:47.750 --> 11:49.210
We're both Jersey girls.

11:54.090 --> 11:56.509
I know it's hard for you
to believe this right now,

11:56.592 --> 11:59.512
but trust me,
by the end of this day,

11:59.595 --> 12:01.597
you and I are
gonna be best friends.

12:08.020 --> 12:09.939
Of all the gifts
you've been sending me,

12:10.606 --> 12:14.110
I've got to say,
this one got me the wettest.

12:35.631 --> 12:37.800
So, I'm waiting.

12:40.928 --> 12:42.138
What?

12:45.683 --> 12:47.017
The phone calls,

12:48.352 --> 12:49.478
the gifts.

12:51.230 --> 12:52.648
Make me understand.

12:55.067 --> 12:58.070
I bet you feel all
high and mighty right now.

12:59.488 --> 13:00.781
That right?

13:02.241 --> 13:03.951
Do you think you're
a powerful man, Scott?

13:05.578 --> 13:06.954
Do you feel powerful?

13:09.290 --> 13:13.043
I am the CTO of
the largest conglomerate...

13:13.419 --> 13:15.296
I'm not interested
in your job title.

13:17.256 --> 13:18.841
I want to understand

13:20.134 --> 13:22.803
what would make
a powerful man like you

13:24.346 --> 13:25.764
risk everything,

13:27.016 --> 13:29.018
all so he could
drive me crazy?

13:36.859 --> 13:38.694
What does it matter?

13:50.331 --> 13:56.462
The morning I learned that
I was promoted to CTO,
I get the call.

13:57.796 --> 14:02.384
Price wanted to hold
an event that night
to announce my position.

14:03.677 --> 14:07.056
I thought,
"I couldn't be any happier."

14:10.017 --> 14:11.727
And then Sharon walked in.

14:13.938 --> 14:17.816
She had made
a doctor's visit

14:19.902 --> 14:21.737
and wanted me
to go with her.

14:23.113 --> 14:26.408
She had found out a month ago
she was pregnant.

14:33.832 --> 14:35.459
Didn't talk.

14:37.044 --> 14:41.257
I didn't know if
she was happy or sad

14:42.424 --> 14:44.426
or if I was happy or sad.

14:48.430 --> 14:51.433
But when we first
saw that sonogram,

14:54.270 --> 14:55.771
we lit up.

14:57.856 --> 15:01.110
I thought...

15:01.235 --> 15:04.488
"This is gonna end up
being the best day
of my life."

15:19.837 --> 15:22.840
After the funeral,
I didn't know why,

15:22.923 --> 15:29.013
I couldn't understand
how I could gain
and lose everything

15:31.807 --> 15:34.268
in one fell swoop.

15:42.234 --> 15:45.029
I wanted you to
feel what I felt.

15:46.989 --> 15:51.243
I wanted to give you hope
that I could step on.

15:58.876 --> 16:00.961
But I'm sorry.

16:37.081 --> 16:40.542
You pussy. You piece of shit.

16:41.377 --> 16:44.004
I hope you rot in
hell like your wife.

16:44.213 --> 16:45.464
You're mourning a woman

16:45.547 --> 16:46.799
who, after she found
out she was pregnant,

16:46.882 --> 16:48.967
was gonna fuck my
husband's brains out.

16:49.093 --> 16:50.386
I'm glad she's dead.

16:50.969 --> 16:52.304
Fuck her
and her fetus corpse.

17:03.315 --> 17:05.526
No wonder
your wife was
gonna cheat on you.

17:06.360 --> 17:07.736
You're weak and pathetic.

17:08.070 --> 17:09.697
That child's lucky to be dead.

17:27.798 --> 17:29.091
No.

17:31.135 --> 17:32.386
Oh, my God.

17:33.429 --> 17:35.305
Oh, my God,
what have I done?

17:36.724 --> 17:37.975
Oh, my God.

17:39.059 --> 17:40.310
My God.

17:50.821 --> 17:52.406
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

17:54.658 --> 17:56.994
Vincent had a punctured lung
and a broken collarbone,

17:57.244 --> 17:58.996
but the doctors say
he's gonna recover.

17:59.997 --> 18:02.082
The bad news is, he's gonna
be arrested and put away

18:02.166 --> 18:04.168
for a long
time for his stunt in D.C.

18:05.961 --> 18:07.087
God.

18:08.338 --> 18:11.008
Politicians love to
teabag the rest of us.

18:12.134 --> 18:14.011
Too bad they can't
take the heat.

18:14.136 --> 18:16.930
What your friend did
was domestic terrorism
in the eyes of the law.

18:17.014 --> 18:18.307
Not my friend.

18:20.851 --> 18:23.353
His associates,
the ones we arrested,

18:24.021 --> 18:26.356
identified you
as the ringleader
of their outfit.

18:28.358 --> 18:31.862
Trust me, I am no leader.

18:33.530 --> 18:35.324
I can barely keep a guy.

18:43.874 --> 18:45.042
Look, Darlene.

18:48.712 --> 18:50.380
I don't really care
what happened in D.C.

18:51.715 --> 18:53.217
In fact, I thought
it was kind of funny.

18:54.176 --> 18:57.179
I've never seen
Congress move as fast
as they did on that day.

18:59.681 --> 19:01.391
But there are serious
holes in your story.

19:02.726 --> 19:05.395
And I want to work with you
to figure out why.

19:15.030 --> 19:17.074
Look. Babe.

19:18.575 --> 19:20.244
I know how this works.

19:21.745 --> 19:25.249
You get close to me,
play the sympathy card,

19:25.749 --> 19:30.254
relate to me.
"We're just two crazy,
wacky Jersey girls."

19:31.755 --> 19:35.759
Take advantage that I did
lose what probably was
the love of my life.

19:37.261 --> 19:39.513
And you act like you care.

19:41.265 --> 19:44.101
But that's just it.
An act.

19:46.228 --> 19:48.605
Which is sick
and twisted.

19:49.189 --> 19:52.025
I'd rather you arrest me
and throw me into jail.

19:53.277 --> 19:55.445
But let's get
something straight.

19:56.446 --> 19:59.366
You will not get
anything out of me.

20:00.742 --> 20:03.287
So why don't you
go read your manual

20:03.412 --> 20:05.789
and find the chapter
on conniving cunts

20:05.873 --> 20:07.624
that don't give a fuck
about you or your feelings

20:07.749 --> 20:09.960
and then get back to me
with some real tactics?

20:10.544 --> 20:12.212
Otherwise,
get me a lawyer.

20:12.713 --> 20:14.214
As far as I'm concerned,

20:14.423 --> 20:16.884
my only statement to you
is that I saw my boyfriend

20:16.967 --> 20:18.969
go brainless
last night at dinner.

20:20.637 --> 20:24.391
I ordered the breakfast combo,
and he stole some of my bacon.

20:27.436 --> 20:30.981
If you want any other details,
the answer is, "Suck a dick."

20:52.169 --> 20:53.337
Wait here.

21:06.183 --> 21:09.686
Remember that movie?
I used to love it growing up.

21:10.228 --> 21:12.981
It's not really scary,
but gory.

21:13.065 --> 21:14.858
You know how those two things
aren't really the same?

21:19.529 --> 21:22.074
This is the stuff we found
from Cisco's place.

21:22.199 --> 21:24.826
Couldn't find any tapes.
Figured you were smart
enough to destroy them.

21:25.869 --> 21:27.871
We're running
fingerprints and DNA.

21:29.247 --> 21:31.458
Soon we're gonna figure out
if those fsociety videos

21:31.541 --> 21:33.085
were filmed
using this camera.

21:34.252 --> 21:36.254
If we find your
DNA on that stuff,

21:39.049 --> 21:42.219
I don't know,
you tell me how that looks.

21:45.430 --> 21:48.266
As far as your fsociety videos
are concerned,

21:48.392 --> 21:51.603
it looks like the one person
that can help you
is fucking dead.

21:52.521 --> 21:54.523
As far as I'm concerned,

21:54.606 --> 21:57.359
Cisco and I were into
filming some freaky shit.

21:58.402 --> 22:00.904
Is that a matter of
national security,
too, hon?

22:07.244 --> 22:08.370
Then there's this.

22:09.955 --> 22:11.915
Remember your buddy,
Xander Jones?

22:13.625 --> 22:16.253
According to him,
you guys had
a sexual relationship.

22:18.588 --> 22:21.466
Dude, are you just
gonna slut shame me all day?

22:22.926 --> 22:24.136
Is that really all you got?

22:24.469 --> 22:27.097
He also said that
you were the one
that stole his gun.

22:27.931 --> 22:29.474
Well, I can't prove that,
obviously, because

22:29.599 --> 22:31.476
your fingerprints
weren't on his safe.

22:32.561 --> 22:35.272
I figured you'd be
crafty enough
to clean up afterward.

22:37.774 --> 22:39.526
What is funny, though,

22:39.609 --> 22:43.155
is that this casing is linked
to the Fun Society Arcade.

22:53.123 --> 22:54.332
Darlene.

22:55.959 --> 22:57.794
You sure you still
don't want to talk to me?

23:13.143 --> 23:14.770
What do you think?

23:17.647 --> 23:19.274
<i>They're
planning something.</i>

23:19.483 --> 23:21.818
<i>Mr. Robot, Tyrell,
Dark Army and Whiterose</i>

23:21.943 --> 23:23.820
<i>are in cahoots to
plan something big.</i>

23:24.696 --> 23:27.657
<i>And the worst part?
They all think it's me.</i>

23:28.325 --> 23:32.204
<i>They all think
I'm the ringleader,
the one in charge,</i>

23:32.829 --> 23:34.831
<i>and I have no idea what it is.</i>

23:35.665 --> 23:38.043
This place is Mount Olympus.

23:40.128 --> 23:41.379
We are prime.

23:42.672 --> 23:43.840
We're ready!

23:47.010 --> 23:48.845
<i>These are
blueprints for a building</i>

23:49.554 --> 23:53.058
<i>and a disassembled firmware
for an uninterruptible
power supply,</i>

23:54.351 --> 23:56.728
<i>but I can't
understand much past that.</i>

23:57.854 --> 23:59.689
<i>I'm not sure what the play is.</i>

24:00.023 --> 24:03.819
<i>I could ask him,
but who am I really asking?</i>

24:04.027 --> 24:06.363
Elliot, look over here.

24:24.840 --> 24:29.010
Paper docs are
coming in from all over,
slowly but surely.

24:30.887 --> 24:32.097
<i>The blueprints.</i>

24:33.014 --> 24:36.393
<i>Is that the building?
The offline version?</i>

24:39.062 --> 24:42.649
Seventeen
of 71 facilities
around the country so far.

24:43.400 --> 24:46.736
Within the next month,
they'll have all
the paper documents here.

24:48.238 --> 24:50.365
I thought we were
gonna have to deal
with multiple facilities,

24:50.448 --> 24:52.951
but they're
making it easier for us
by moving it all to one.

24:53.076 --> 24:54.953
<i>This is where
the paper records are going.</i>

24:55.078 --> 24:57.247
<i>They're trying to
rebuild the database.</i>

24:57.330 --> 24:59.291
<i>Titles and deeds,
the bloodline</i>

24:59.416 --> 25:01.459
<i>of all real
property in this country.</i>

25:01.626 --> 25:03.336
<i>This is how
they're surviving the hack.</i>

25:03.420 --> 25:06.464
When our malware executes,
their whole program...

25:06.590 --> 25:07.591
Our malware?

25:09.926 --> 25:13.180
What malware?
Oh, you orchestrated
it beautifully.

25:14.264 --> 25:15.348
When the hacked firmware...

25:15.432 --> 25:19.311
Designed to
override the safety limits
on the UPS devices

25:20.270 --> 25:23.273
and overcharge
the lead acid batteries
in the battery room,

25:25.442 --> 25:27.944
filling the space up
with hydrogen gas.

25:28.361 --> 25:31.698
After breaking the fans
and cutting off backup power,

25:32.657 --> 25:34.826
the malicious
firmware repeatedly

25:34.951 --> 25:37.787
re-engages
the UPS autotransformer,

25:38.121 --> 25:40.332
creating a spark
to ignite an explosion.

25:43.793 --> 25:45.545
There are enough
batteries to produce

25:45.629 --> 25:47.964
enough hydrogen gas
to level the building.

25:48.298 --> 25:52.302
When you hacked Evil Corp,
you gave us access
to the backdoor.

25:53.303 --> 25:55.513
You made it possible
for us to infect them.

25:55.639 --> 25:57.933
<i>I coded the femtocell
malware for Darlene.</i>

25:58.016 --> 25:59.893
<i>But it wasn't
supposed to be for this.</i>

25:59.976 --> 26:02.812
The conference call leak,
I must admit,

26:02.979 --> 26:05.690
was quite cute,
nice distraction.

26:07.817 --> 26:10.820
But this is for us.

26:16.660 --> 26:17.994
All of us.

26:23.833 --> 26:26.336
I'm gonna rip his
fucking face off!

26:26.878 --> 26:30.715
This fucker thinks
he can hurt my girl.
What's his address?

26:30.924 --> 26:32.592
Tell me his address,
'cause I'm gonna go find him,

26:32.676 --> 26:34.177
and I'm gonna
fucking kill him.

26:38.348 --> 26:39.557
Are you done?

26:41.351 --> 26:44.271
If you're serious
about punishing him...
I am. I am.

26:46.690 --> 26:49.234
Just tell me what to do,
and I'll fucking do it.

26:49.359 --> 26:52.237
I'll do it.
No questions asked. Just...

26:52.362 --> 26:53.363
Shh...

26:56.032 --> 26:58.326
If you are serious
about punishing him,

26:58.410 --> 27:00.704
then you can do
one thing for me.

27:02.872 --> 27:04.833
What? Anything.
Say the word.

27:08.837 --> 27:11.715
You remember the night we met
at the E Corp party?

27:13.049 --> 27:14.259
Yeah.

27:16.052 --> 27:19.222
You were tending
the bar that night.
You stayed late to clean up.

27:21.391 --> 27:23.268
Yeah, that's what we
always do after the...

27:23.393 --> 27:27.230
Then you saw Scott coming down
from the stairwell
leading to the roof.

27:29.274 --> 27:33.403
He was disheveled,
out of breath, sweaty.

27:35.405 --> 27:38.074
You were about to ask him
if he needed anything,

27:39.409 --> 27:42.078
but he was in such a hurry,
he left without saying a word.

27:44.914 --> 27:47.876
What are you talking about?
I didn't see
anything like that.

27:48.460 --> 27:50.879
Yes, you did.

27:52.297 --> 27:53.590
No.

27:54.632 --> 27:56.718
I remember because
the cops were asking

27:56.801 --> 27:59.012
every one of us
questions about that night,

27:59.095 --> 28:03.308
and like I told them,
cleaned up my station,
and I went home.

28:03.892 --> 28:06.102
Derek,
you said you were serious
about punishing him.

28:07.937 --> 28:10.565
Yeah, but, Joanna...
Look at my face, Derek.

28:11.608 --> 28:13.193
You want the man
that did this to me

28:13.276 --> 28:14.903
to do what he did
and get away with it?

28:15.445 --> 28:18.281
But, Joanna, I...
Once you tell
the cops your story,

28:19.115 --> 28:22.911
they're gonna ask you
why you're just now confessing
after months of silence.

28:24.913 --> 28:27.248
You're gonna tell them
that you were scared,

28:27.332 --> 28:29.667
that Scott Knowles
intimidated you.

28:31.628 --> 28:33.505
That when Tyrell
went missing,

28:33.630 --> 28:36.091
you didn't think any of
that mattered anymore.

28:37.842 --> 28:40.136
But your conscience
got the better of you.

28:43.848 --> 28:45.475
This is how we win.

28:47.811 --> 28:49.354
This is how
we punish him.

28:51.815 --> 28:53.149
You understand?

28:57.821 --> 28:58.988
Thank you.

29:01.324 --> 29:03.326
Thank you for protecting me.

29:09.666 --> 29:11.459
Of course, babe.
I love you.

29:19.217 --> 29:21.010
Now, let's go over it again.

29:23.054 --> 29:24.472
We can't do this.

29:24.556 --> 29:28.560
You want us to stay on target?
This is the target.
This gets us to the top.

29:29.811 --> 29:32.105
I know we've been
operating under top secret
on this program,

29:32.188 --> 29:33.523
but I think
it's worth the risk.

29:33.648 --> 29:37.652
This girl's being a wiseass.
She thinks she's
smarter than we are.

29:37.735 --> 29:39.863
That's because
so far she has been.

29:39.988 --> 29:42.031
We got to show
her we're smarter.

29:42.991 --> 29:46.202
Unless she thinks
we're worthy,
none of this is gonna fly.

29:47.203 --> 29:48.746
Just trying to
sidestep the mines,
like you said.

29:48.872 --> 29:51.082
We've been building this plan
for three months.

29:51.207 --> 29:52.542
Look around you.

29:53.376 --> 29:56.337
All our leads
are getting killed
and disappearing.

29:56.421 --> 29:57.881
We've lost three suspects.

29:58.756 --> 30:00.383
Dark Army's cleaning house.

30:01.384 --> 30:03.720
So it must mean
something is about to go down.

30:04.929 --> 30:06.222
Our window is closing.

30:06.389 --> 30:09.976
Every lead we've been
following up to this point
has led to a dead end.

30:10.059 --> 30:12.187
Yeah, I'm gonna bring
the ADIC in on this.

30:13.688 --> 30:17.734
Please, you're gonna
let him try and flip her?
She's gonna shut down.

30:18.943 --> 30:20.361
I'm right for this.

30:20.445 --> 30:21.863
Then I'm gonna
go in with you.

30:25.366 --> 30:26.701
Let me do it alone.

30:30.872 --> 30:32.207
I know her.

30:35.126 --> 30:36.419
I am her.

30:40.465 --> 30:44.385
And if we're doing this,
we're doing this now.

31:03.780 --> 31:08.826
We have 6,332 agents
working on just
this case alone.

31:10.787 --> 31:14.916
It's the hardest case I've
ever worked on and probably
the hardest one I ever will.

31:16.125 --> 31:18.962
Swear to God,
the only reason why I think
I've gotten this far

31:23.132 --> 31:25.009
is because I have no life.

31:28.513 --> 31:31.099
It's the only thing
I've been able to think about.

31:32.850 --> 31:34.435
Now I'm sitting here with you

31:36.604 --> 31:38.314
in this awful room.

31:40.817 --> 31:44.112
And no matter
what story gets written
in the final analysis,

31:44.946 --> 31:49.659
we've both been a part
of one of the biggest
events in world history.

31:52.453 --> 31:54.122
Believe what you want.

31:54.998 --> 31:59.460
But neither you
nor I are special.

32:01.170 --> 32:03.298
I've already
learned that lesson.

32:11.472 --> 32:13.349
If you're open to
changing your mind,

32:15.184 --> 32:16.477
I'd like to
show you something.

32:19.355 --> 32:20.565
Come with me.

32:31.034 --> 32:33.494
You're a lot more
special than you think.

33:49.987 --> 33:52.073
Sure,
the strategy was risky,

33:54.909 --> 33:56.577
but we knew we
only had one shot.

34:01.582 --> 34:03.793
If we rounded
everyone up, guns blazing,

34:05.253 --> 34:07.338
we thought we would never
get the man in the middle.

34:09.632 --> 34:11.759
And with the stakes
being this high,

34:12.176 --> 34:15.513
it was imperative that
we got him before he knew
we were getting him.

34:20.768 --> 34:23.479
So we sat back and waited.

34:26.274 --> 34:28.109
They call it
the python approach.

34:30.611 --> 34:35.616
They'll lie in wait
for the right
moment to strike.

34:38.453 --> 34:40.955
You know some
can go up to a year
without eating?

34:45.960 --> 34:47.044
Patient predator.

34:53.509 --> 34:55.970
And then Romero's death
made you all scurry.

34:58.848 --> 35:01.309
Funny enough,
you thought
Dark Army was involved.

35:02.894 --> 35:07.356
As it turns out,
it was just a stray bullet
from the neighbor next door.

35:09.025 --> 35:10.359
Freak accident.

36:28.062 --> 36:30.064
You've got to be
fucking kidding me.

36:37.196 --> 36:39.699
<i>I've tried everything.
I fought him.</i>

36:39.949 --> 36:42.577
<i>I OD'd on Adderall.
I made peace with him.</i>

36:42.869 --> 36:45.037
<i>I even got myself arrested.</i>

36:45.413 --> 36:48.040
<i>No matter what I do,
he always finds a way.</i>

36:48.749 --> 36:51.544
<i>Why?
That's all I want to know.</i>

36:51.627 --> 36:54.589
Why is it so important
for you to torment me?

36:55.548 --> 36:58.050
What is it that you
care so much about?

36:59.135 --> 37:01.888
What's this all for?
I'm not tormenting you.

37:01.971 --> 37:04.974
After everything
you've put me through,
you continue to lie?

37:05.099 --> 37:06.475
I didn't lie to you.

37:06.601 --> 37:09.478
He's alive, man!
He's sitting
right fucking there!

37:11.397 --> 37:12.815
You made a plan
with the Dark Army.

37:12.940 --> 37:15.443
When was that?
The night of the hack?

37:15.985 --> 37:19.447
When is stage two?
The femtocell, the backdoor?

37:19.822 --> 37:21.324
You planned all
of that with him?

37:21.407 --> 37:22.742
You can't look
at it like this.

37:22.825 --> 37:26.162
You're me. I'm you.
You figured that out.
We're the same guy.

37:26.245 --> 37:28.331
Everything
you're blaming me for,
you're blaming yourself for.

37:28.414 --> 37:32.668
Stop talking in circles.
You got Whiterose
to get us out of prison.

37:32.793 --> 37:36.672
The release. That was you.
You somehow communicated
with them.

37:36.797 --> 37:39.342
It's what you wanted.
You said to Darlene
before we started this thing

37:39.467 --> 37:41.677
that we had to go all the way.
It was all part of the plan.

37:41.844 --> 37:43.429
Otherwise, what was
the point of the hack?

37:43.512 --> 37:47.099
If we were going to do this,
we had to go all the way.

37:47.183 --> 37:48.517
And that,
Elliot, is what I want.

37:48.601 --> 37:50.269
It's what you
asked me here for.

37:50.353 --> 37:54.607
Then tell me,
what is that, exactly?
What is "all the way"?

37:54.690 --> 37:56.359
This is where we
get into trouble.

37:56.609 --> 37:59.028
You're meant to know
only as much as
you can handle.

37:59.111 --> 38:02.114
When you wander
outside of your realm
is when we end up fighting.

38:08.537 --> 38:09.789
Are you...

38:11.040 --> 38:12.833
Are you
distracting me right now?

38:20.883 --> 38:22.218
What are you doing?

38:23.844 --> 38:26.055
I'm hacking the firmware
like we discussed.

38:26.681 --> 38:28.224
We didn't discuss shit.

38:30.309 --> 38:34.397
We're not hacking anything.
This will level that
building and kill people.

38:34.563 --> 38:36.148
Elliot, you need to
leave that computer alone.

38:36.232 --> 38:37.525
I'm confused.

38:37.733 --> 38:39.485
It's over.
I'm deleting the malware.

38:39.819 --> 38:42.154
Elliot,
I wouldn't do that.
You can't delete that.

38:42.321 --> 38:45.408
Not only am I gonna delete it,
I'm gonna get rid
of the backdoor.

38:45.491 --> 38:47.576
You do that,
and everything
we worked for is gone.

38:47.702 --> 38:50.246
Elliot, I am warning you.
This isn't what I want.

38:50.329 --> 38:51.747
I want it shut down.

38:52.415 --> 38:54.083
But this was your idea.

39:00.506 --> 39:03.342
Leave the computer alone!
He's not gonna
let you do this.

39:03.426 --> 39:04.427
Trust me.

39:28.951 --> 39:30.578
I don't know
what's gotten into you.

39:31.620 --> 39:34.957
We're supposed to be gods
together, and yet you want
to destroy our destiny?

39:35.750 --> 39:37.126
You're not making sense.

39:39.295 --> 39:42.465
Elliot, listen to him.
Walk away from the computer.

39:54.226 --> 39:55.811
You're the same.

39:58.314 --> 40:00.232
What the fuck are
you talking about?

40:00.316 --> 40:02.109
We are definitely
not the same!

40:02.234 --> 40:03.986
Back away
from the computer.

40:09.408 --> 40:12.244
<i>This is just another
of Mr. Robot's mind tricks.</i>

40:13.913 --> 40:14.955
No.

40:16.248 --> 40:17.416
Elliot.

40:19.335 --> 40:21.504
I don't want to
shoot you, but I will.

40:21.629 --> 40:23.506
Elliot, listen to him.

40:25.174 --> 40:26.759
He's not holding a gun.

40:27.927 --> 40:29.261
He's not even there.

40:30.096 --> 40:32.014
Elliot,
you need to listen to him

40:32.098 --> 40:34.475
and step away
from the computer!

40:34.975 --> 40:36.852
Touch that keyboard,
and I will shoot you.

40:39.980 --> 40:41.148
No.

40:46.278 --> 40:47.279
He won't.

40:49.448 --> 40:50.699
He can't.

40:53.702 --> 40:54.954
He doesn't exist.

40:58.541 --> 41:00.501
I'm the only one that exists.

41:07.174 --> 41:09.510
It's time to
finally take back control.

41:18.644 --> 41:20.479
Real control.

41:39.707 --> 41:40.708
No.

42:22.791 --> 42:24.627
You know,
when you gave me this,

42:24.710 --> 42:27.963
you said to stop anyone
who gets in
the way of our plan.

42:28.047 --> 42:30.966
I didn't know what you meant,
but now it's very clear.

42:33.636 --> 42:35.387
You did this to yourself,
Elliot.

42:37.806 --> 42:40.100
You asked earlier
what "all the way" is.

42:41.060 --> 42:43.979
This is it. Sorry, kiddo.

42:45.731 --> 42:50.319
I couldn't let anyone
stop this, including us.

43:04.667 --> 43:06.669
Thanks for staying
with us, Codyites.

43:07.962 --> 43:09.338
There's a lot to
get to tonight.

43:12.132 --> 43:16.345
Look, all we do here is,
we try and bring you
the truth.

43:19.556 --> 43:22.059
And they're trying
to take that away.

43:22.142 --> 43:25.187
They tried to take it away.
Some of you might notice your
lights flickering tonight.

43:25.271 --> 43:26.397
Now, the faith...

43:29.733 --> 43:30.734
<i>Hello?</i>

43:33.112 --> 43:34.530
Don't worry. It's Angela.

43:36.740 --> 43:39.702
Tyrell? Tyrell, are you there?

43:41.161 --> 43:42.371
It's okay.

43:42.913 --> 43:45.666
They told me you
would be calling.
This is a secure line.

43:47.293 --> 43:50.379
Are you with Elliot
right now?
<i>Yes.</i>

43:51.255 --> 43:52.840
Okay, I'm on my way.

43:53.549 --> 43:56.760
Don't let anyone near him.
I should be the first person
he sees when he wakes up.

43:59.847 --> 44:00.931
<i>Okay.</i>

44:01.974 --> 44:03.767
Tyrell, you did
what needed to be done.

44:05.394 --> 44:06.603
<i>I love him.</i>

44:09.648 --> 44:10.941
I do, too.

45:34.358 --> 45:36.026
Have you given
any more thought
to what I said?

45:37.194 --> 45:38.445
I don't
wanna discuss this.

45:39.988 --> 45:41.615
Mobley.
Fredrick.

45:44.535 --> 45:49.123
Seriously, Fredrick,
what if we could?

45:50.541 --> 45:52.042
This might work.

45:52.209 --> 45:53.752
And also, it might not.

45:54.670 --> 45:56.672
I've taken enough
risks for one lifetime.

45:57.256 --> 45:58.924
I don't want to
discuss it anymore.

46:03.220 --> 46:05.305
But what if we could
generate the keys...
Tanya.

46:08.475 --> 46:11.061
Will you just
please shut up?

46:11.895 --> 46:14.982
What? This is important.
We need to talk about it.

46:15.065 --> 46:16.275
Change the subject.

46:16.358 --> 46:17.943
I don't want to
change the subject.

46:19.903 --> 46:21.238
I miss my family.

46:22.489 --> 46:25.701
I don't want to live here.
Come on, it's nice out here.

46:25.909 --> 46:29.455
You know, look,
no more bad winters.
Hardly rains.

46:30.080 --> 46:31.331
That's great.

46:32.958 --> 46:34.835
I hate your friend.
He's a dick.

46:34.918 --> 46:37.754
No, I told you.
He did not know you
were in the bathroom.

46:37.880 --> 46:40.632
Trust me, he knew
exactly what he was doing.

46:41.258 --> 46:42.259
Weirdo.

46:42.426 --> 46:45.637
Save up enough money,
you'll be able to get your own
place eventually, okay?

46:45.721 --> 46:48.432
Apartments here
are dirt cheap.
Won't be that long.

46:49.308 --> 46:51.935
Just be thankful
he was able to
get us this job.

46:56.231 --> 46:58.442
Hey, what flavor
did you get again?
You want to trade?

47:00.027 --> 47:02.529
Please, just look at it.

47:05.240 --> 47:07.743
Okay, so what? Say I did.

47:08.827 --> 47:09.828
Then what?

47:10.662 --> 47:12.873
If what I discovered is real,
do you know what that means?

47:14.124 --> 47:17.002
Yeah, I know
exactly what it means.

47:17.294 --> 47:20.464
Yeah. It means
we could potentially
undo this whole thing.

47:20.923 --> 47:22.466
Put everything
back the way it was.

47:23.675 --> 47:25.677
I know. I know.

47:27.638 --> 47:28.764
Please.

47:29.640 --> 47:31.767
- Just look at what I found.
- Excuse me.

47:32.768 --> 47:34.311
Sorry, dude.
We're on a break.

47:34.895 --> 47:36.730
Yeah,
I just had a quick question.

47:38.607 --> 47:40.067
Do you have the time?
