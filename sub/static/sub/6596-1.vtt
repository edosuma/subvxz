00:41.666 --> 00:45.294

Coach.

01:05.482 --> 01:07.066
Huh.

01:07.150 --> 01:08.901
We're up
by so much.

01:08.985 --> 01:11.403
Do you think we could
put my brother in
the game?

01:11.488 --> 01:13.572
Yeah, Sean Barnes,

02:20.056 --> 02:20.931
Oh!

02:23.768 --> 02:26.645
- Can I get a--
- Hold on.

02:26.729 --> 02:29.481
You don't get a drink until
we win or go into overtime.

02:29.566 --> 02:31.358
- I just want a beer.
- Uh-uh! Look.

02:31.442 --> 02:33.360
You come into my bar
on a Saturday afternoon

02:33.444 --> 02:35.404
you'd better order
your drinks before
or at half time,

02:35.488 --> 02:37.698
but when the game is on,
nobody interrupts. Okay.

02:37.782 --> 02:39.992
Hey! Bee's bar.

02:40.076 --> 02:41.535
My bad, y'all.

02:41.619 --> 02:43.036
35 seconds left.
Let's bring it up!

02:43.079 --> 02:44.955
I want it! I want it!
I'm ready.

02:49.085 --> 02:50.210

03:10.773 --> 03:12.524
(Bee)
Who is that?

03:12.567 --> 03:14.067
That's my baby!

03:14.110 --> 03:15.444
There's more action
from the dealer.

03:15.528 --> 03:17.196
When will it
be turned around?

03:17.280 --> 03:19.698
Man, you see I'm watching
the game here, Sean.

03:19.741 --> 03:21.533
When you gonna sell
this old 'vette of yours?

03:21.618 --> 03:23.327
When I feel like giving
you a commission.

03:23.369 --> 03:25.204
Now sit down and watch
your brother play ball.

03:25.246 --> 03:27.122
I can't mess around.
I'm up for promotion.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.041
Hey, you think I can get
a ride back?

03:29.125 --> 03:31.210
Sean, I'm watching
the game. C'mon!

03:31.294 --> 03:32.711
Jeez, man.

03:36.007 --> 03:38.217
Do it D.

03:38.259 --> 03:39.885
You have to watch this.

03:39.969 --> 03:41.261
Oh, yeah!

03:42.931 --> 03:44.389
Timeout! Blue.

03:44.474 --> 03:45.599
Time out!

03:45.683 --> 03:46.475
Shut the fuck up!

03:46.517 --> 03:48.560
Damn!

03:48.603 --> 03:50.687
(announcer)
...back on their
eleven yard line.

03:50.772 --> 03:53.315
Raise that hand again
and they gonna be calling
you Stubby.

03:53.358 --> 03:55.692
Yeah, and don't think
she's playing around.

03:55.777 --> 03:56.902
I've seen that
action before.

03:59.948 --> 04:03.075
Let's go Twizz left,
80 to slice...

04:03.117 --> 04:04.493
Stop running
that bullshit.

04:04.577 --> 04:05.953
The line is
too strong.

04:06.037 --> 04:07.246
All right.
Fuck it!

04:07.330 --> 04:09.206
Line, let 'em come through.

04:09.290 --> 04:12.417
We'll hit 'em with base,
Seattle Blue, on one
on one.

04:12.460 --> 04:13.335
All right!

04:13.419 --> 04:14.711

04:21.719 --> 04:22.928

04:40.029 --> 04:40.946
[loud thud]

04:46.577 --> 04:52.165
[whooping, cheering]

05:01.551 --> 05:03.593
Hey! Hey, could I get
that ride?

05:09.559 --> 05:13.687
Right now, Bernie's

a beer.

05:13.771 --> 05:15.314
- Wow!
- Yeah!

05:15.398 --> 05:17.482
Gimme some dap.

05:17.567 --> 05:20.360
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

05:20.403 --> 05:22.154
One, two, three, D!

05:22.196 --> 05:24.156
Hit the showers.
Good game!

05:26.034 --> 05:27.534
Deon, a word.

05:27.577 --> 05:29.328
I just wanted
a quick word with you.

05:30.788 --> 05:32.998
[laughs]

05:33.041 --> 05:34.666
I'm gonna
make this quick.

05:34.751 --> 05:36.752
I don't want to put you
on the spot.

05:36.794 --> 05:39.504
You did something tonight
that was really
wonderful to see.

05:39.547 --> 05:41.631
You showed
tremendous character.

05:41.716 --> 05:43.967
Don't ever forget it.
You won the game for us

05:44.052 --> 05:46.011
without scoring touchdowns.

05:46.095 --> 05:48.472
I want you to know
that every sportscaster
in the country,

05:48.514 --> 05:51.391
from ESPN , CBS
is gonna be showing
highlights of this game

05:51.476 --> 05:54.811
and they're gonna
be showing you
taking people out.

05:54.854 --> 05:57.189
Because of that,
I'd like you
to have this game ball.

05:57.273 --> 05:59.524
I want you to take it
to the N FL with you

05:59.609 --> 06:02.069
and put it on your shelf
and then invite me over,
so I can...

06:02.153 --> 06:05.030
hang out in your big house,
pretend it's mine.

06:05.114 --> 06:06.073
All right?

06:06.157 --> 06:07.824
Thanks, Coach.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.951
You have a good time, tonight.
Not too good.

06:28.888 --> 06:30.555
Four three.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.349
What's that?

06:32.433 --> 06:34.643
What was your fastest
time off the line tonight?

06:34.727 --> 06:38.438
Because, uh,
I ran a 4-3-40.

06:38.523 --> 06:40.982
I was All State
in three different sports.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.609
Come on, we heard
this before.

06:42.693 --> 06:44.736
Then why didn't you
take it?

06:44.821 --> 06:46.613
You got all these
scouts in the stands

06:46.697 --> 06:48.907
taking down your stats
every night.

06:48.991 --> 06:52.160
Deon, you see
the endzone
in your sight,

06:52.245 --> 06:54.079
you take it.

06:54.163 --> 06:58.834
Don't throw your
opportunity away,
like I did mine.

06:58.918 --> 07:02.337
You got one season
left at this university.

07:02.422 --> 07:05.340
You don't
forget that.

07:05.425 --> 07:08.093
We won the game.

07:08.177 --> 07:13.598
Son, I didn't have
anyone watching
my back

07:13.683 --> 07:17.018
who knew the game.

07:17.103 --> 07:22.149
I'm watching your back.
Okay?

07:22.233 --> 07:23.817
You go have fun.

07:23.901 --> 07:26.611
And you party, but
keep your nose clean.

07:26.696 --> 07:28.530
And your dick clean.
I know yo' ass.

07:28.614 --> 07:29.698
Huh?

07:29.782 --> 07:31.074
Yes, sir.

07:31.159 --> 07:32.367
Yeah, I'm
watching yo' ass.

07:32.452 --> 07:36.997
[rap music]

07:46.007 --> 07:48.216
You were amazing tonight.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.968
Alright, alright, how?

07:50.052 --> 07:51.887
How did you see
that shit out there, man?

07:51.971 --> 07:54.014
You had two
guys on you.

07:54.098 --> 07:56.516
Man, you boys
never play flea flicker
when you was a kid, man?

07:56.601 --> 07:59.060
We been running the same
plays since peewee leagues.

07:59.145 --> 08:01.396
We took the ball
every practice.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.315
See how many times
you make it change hands
before we cross the goal.

08:03.357 --> 08:04.941
No shit?

08:05.026 --> 08:06.860
I had two choices
out there tonight.

08:06.944 --> 08:08.778
I coulda held
onto the ball
and went down with it,

08:08.863 --> 08:10.489
or when my quarterback is
running on the right,

08:10.573 --> 08:12.574
I flick that ball out
and we in the end zone!

08:12.658 --> 08:14.075
[all laugh]

08:14.160 --> 08:16.411
It was incredible
to see you.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.580
But I didn't see it.

08:18.664 --> 08:19.998
No, you
didn't see it?

08:20.041 --> 08:21.917
You had
too much
to drink.

08:22.001 --> 08:25.504
[rap music]

08:40.394 --> 08:42.604
Ladies, ladies, ladies.

08:42.688 --> 08:46.024
I overheard y'all
conversation and I got
one question to ask.

08:46.067 --> 08:48.527
Are you all here
for the love of Deon?

08:48.611 --> 08:49.945
You're friends
with Deon?

08:50.029 --> 08:51.404
Hell, yeah.

08:51.489 --> 08:53.073
Y'all wanna

08:53.157 --> 08:55.367
Ya gotta dance

08:55.409 --> 08:56.952
Well--

08:57.036 --> 08:58.745
He wants to dance.
You wanna dance?

08:58.829 --> 09:00.789
Let's make it happen.
Come on, we at
a party.

09:00.873 --> 09:01.706
Okay.

09:01.791 --> 09:03.250
Come on.

09:03.334 --> 09:05.710
Oh, I like
what I'm seeing.

09:05.795 --> 09:09.130
Hold on.
Let's make
a sandwich.

09:09.215 --> 09:12.884
Five dollar.
Going down.

09:12.927 --> 09:15.971
I'm interracial datin'.

09:16.055 --> 09:18.890
(Deon)
That's my motherfuckin'

09:18.975 --> 09:20.559
That's my boy
right there.

09:20.643 --> 09:22.769
[all laugh]

09:22.853 --> 09:24.980
That's why we win
the motherfucking
games, man.

09:25.064 --> 09:28.066
[all laugh]

09:28.109 --> 09:29.317
That's why we won.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.485
Yeah.

09:30.570 --> 09:31.903
Yo, Sean.

09:31.946 --> 09:33.738

09:33.781 --> 09:35.949
Yo.

09:36.033 --> 09:38.243
What's up, man.

09:38.327 --> 09:39.494
It's a party, man,
enjoy yourself.

09:39.579 --> 09:40.996
I know,
I'm fine.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.372
I knew you was
gonna be here.

09:42.456 --> 09:43.707
Congratulations
on the game.

09:43.791 --> 09:45.750
Yeah, that
went good.

09:45.793 --> 09:47.794
Yeah, I'm gonna leave.
This ain't my scene.

09:47.878 --> 09:52.591
What you need to do
is take care of this
shit right here.

09:52.633 --> 09:54.926
Turn you into
a up and comer.

09:55.011 --> 09:56.845
That way one of these
bitches around here

09:56.929 --> 09:59.848
keep you up and coming.
Know what I'm
talking about?

09:59.932 --> 10:01.600
Nah, that's alright.

10:01.642 --> 10:04.644
Man, fuck

Fuck beer, man.

10:04.729 --> 10:07.105
Man made beer.
God made weed.

10:07.189 --> 10:09.482
[laughter]

10:09.567 --> 10:11.610
See them little
bitches over there?

10:11.652 --> 10:13.111
Yeah.

10:13.195 --> 10:14.613
Like 'em?
They're something.

10:14.697 --> 10:16.406
Yeah.

10:16.490 --> 10:19.951
Excuse me, sweethearts,
I told y'all, come here.

10:20.036 --> 10:21.369
Yeah.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.580
[music]

10:23.664 --> 10:27.042
We can go upstairs and be away
from all this noise,
if you want.

10:27.126 --> 10:29.794
[inaudible]

10:29.879 --> 10:31.921
Okay, let's go.

10:38.971 --> 10:42.057
It's that easy when you
the big bad ole cat.

10:42.141 --> 10:44.225
I'll holler.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.935
[rap music]

10:56.656 --> 10:59.699
[romantic music]

11:04.330 --> 11:05.372
(Deon)
Mm.

11:07.708 --> 11:08.792
Mm.

11:15.257 --> 11:16.299
(coach)
Go.

11:24.475 --> 11:27.352
Nine five.
Nine nine.
Eleven one.

11:30.022 --> 11:31.523
Come on.

11:35.111 --> 11:36.778
That's good,
that's good.

11:36.862 --> 11:40.031
That's not bad.

11:40.116 --> 11:42.283
Come on, get up.
Open up your chest.
Get air.

11:42.368 --> 11:43.785
[groan]

11:43.869 --> 11:45.495
Are you alright?

11:45.579 --> 11:47.956
Yeah, probably just
a little dehydrated.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.165
You wanna quit?

11:49.250 --> 11:51.710
Hell no.
Reset that.

11:51.794 --> 11:56.089
[chuckles]
I thought so.
Alright, and--go!

12:01.512 --> 12:03.805
High step dancing now.

12:03.889 --> 12:05.640
Okay, as
Ben Jones said,

12:05.725 --> 12:08.476
American jobs are jobs
installing insulation,

12:08.561 --> 12:11.062
putting in solar paneling,
putting in weather proofing,

12:11.147 --> 12:13.440
and we have to decide
do we want to support

12:13.524 --> 12:16.401
a dirty fossil fuel industry

[muttering]

13:42.738 --> 13:44.989
Never mind him,

14:47.219 --> 14:50.555
Your brother's a

14:50.598 --> 14:54.726
He can't even come

14:54.768 --> 14:56.728

You smell good.

15:18.626 --> 15:20.251
Well, baby,

15:20.336 --> 15:22.420
You gotta go wash
the gasoline
off of you.

15:22.504 --> 15:24.088
BMW, Black
Man Working,

15:24.173 --> 15:26.507

in this economy.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.635
You like that.

15:28.719 --> 15:30.345
Ten seconds left, last
play of the game, y'all

15:30.429 --> 15:31.638

15:31.722 --> 15:32.972

15:33.057 --> 15:34.307
All right,

15:34.391 --> 15:36.351
You ready?

15:36.435 --> 15:39.437
Getcha all pumped up.
Who wanna go out,

15:39.480 --> 15:41.022
(tall boy)
Throw me

15:41.106 --> 15:42.440
(boy)
You ain't
gotta push.

15:42.524 --> 15:45.193
Shut up.

15:45.277 --> 15:49.030
Alright, go ahead,
go long.

15:49.114 --> 15:52.784
Alright, you can run
faster than that.
Come on, man, run.

15:52.868 --> 15:57.872
I'm gonna hit you
at the hump.
Go ahead, run.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.624
Here, y'all
take the ball.

15:59.667 --> 16:01.376
Don't let him push
you around, man.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.336
Yeah.

16:08.258 --> 16:11.135
Oh, and please,
get that scarf
off your head.

16:11.220 --> 16:13.221
Or you will not
get the result
you want tonight.

16:13.305 --> 16:15.390
You gonna
play the p-card with me?

16:15.474 --> 16:16.557
I'm just saying.

16:19.478 --> 16:23.314
Get your hands outta--
what am I gonna do
with you!

16:23.399 --> 16:25.233
Didn't even hurt.

16:25.317 --> 16:27.402
I know she was trying
to show me love
and affection.

16:27.486 --> 16:29.404
You see that? You
see what he's saying?

16:29.488 --> 16:31.572
He's saying he gets
away with it. You
spoil him.

16:31.657 --> 16:32.615
And I don't.

16:32.700 --> 16:34.409
That is my son.

16:34.493 --> 16:35.994
That's my problem
with women.

16:36.078 --> 16:38.538
I always put them up
against my mom

16:38.622 --> 16:39.872
and they don't
stand a chance.

16:39.957 --> 16:42.166
Oh, that's my baby.

16:42.209 --> 16:43.334
[kissing sounds]

16:43.377 --> 16:45.336
That's right.

16:45.379 --> 16:47.839
Do--do--do you
know the song
"My Girl"?

16:47.923 --> 16:50.758
You should sing that.
This here is my girl.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.468
All right,
all right.

16:52.511 --> 16:54.178
Dinner's in ten minutes.
Get your brother.

16:54.221 --> 16:55.513
All right.

16:55.556 --> 16:57.432
You get the shower.

16:57.516 --> 16:58.558
Later.

16:58.642 --> 17:00.059
Would you please.

17:00.144 --> 17:01.352
Halftime is
my time. I'll wash up.

17:01.395 --> 17:02.186
Please.

17:02.229 --> 17:03.563
Okay.

17:03.647 --> 17:05.897
And put on that
cologne I like.

17:05.983 --> 17:09.027
Wait until you taste,
baby, this cheddar
corn bread, baby.

17:09.069 --> 17:10.611
You gonna love me
all over again.

17:10.695 --> 17:13.114
I like what
I'm seeing.

17:13.198 --> 17:14.991
Ooh.

17:17.911 --> 17:18.953
[knocking]

17:19.038 --> 17:20.788
Yaho.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.957
Buddy, what it do,
big homie.

17:23.041 --> 17:24.709
What up.

17:24.792 --> 17:26.752
Man, I came over here
so we can go to the mall,

17:26.837 --> 17:28.713
and I can get at
some bitches.

17:28.756 --> 17:30.381
What do you need me
to go with you for?

17:30.424 --> 17:32.133
I don't need
you to come.

17:32.217 --> 17:34.969
A good pimp
need an assistant.
Go get the car.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.096
Hey, June. I don't
know where you
gonna put

17:37.181 --> 17:38.723
this third helping.

17:38.766 --> 17:40.641
Aw, man.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.894
[sniffing]

17:42.936 --> 17:45.646
June, why in the hell do
you come in my house
smelling like that?

17:45.731 --> 17:47.648
What?

17:47.733 --> 17:49.942
But this is
my special cologne.

17:50.027 --> 17:53.529
What? New Cannabis
Cold Water?

17:53.572 --> 17:54.906
No, it works.

17:54.948 --> 17:57.492
The hood rats
love it.

17:57.576 --> 17:59.327
Ms. Barnes, you think
I can get a plate too?

17:59.411 --> 18:01.496
You can go in and
make yourself a plate.

18:01.580 --> 18:02.538
Please?

18:05.959 --> 18:08.127
Thank you.

18:09.838 --> 18:12.131
Hey, man, your
momma got wild.

18:12.216 --> 18:14.425
Don't be looking
at my momma
like that.

18:14.468 --> 18:15.718
Just playing.

18:15.803 --> 18:17.303
I ain't playing
with you.

18:17.387 --> 18:19.639
Aw, shit.
Here come Poindexter.

18:19.723 --> 18:21.390
Hey, Sean.

18:21.475 --> 18:24.268
You gonna chill
and watch the game
with us?

18:24.353 --> 18:30.650
Okay.

18:30.734 --> 18:34.112
What about that girl?
You call her?

18:34.154 --> 18:35.113
No.

18:35.197 --> 18:36.489
Why not?

18:36.573 --> 18:37.907
I didn't feel
right about it.

18:37.991 --> 18:39.450
I mean, how
would that look?

18:39.535 --> 18:40.868
Me calling after
you talked to her?

18:40.953 --> 18:45.540
What?
What the fuck?

18:45.624 --> 18:48.042
Man, you shoulda
gave me the number.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.503
Your brother don't
want no pussy.

18:50.587 --> 18:52.964
Sittin' up with in
motherfucker reading books

18:53.006 --> 18:54.507
playing love jeopardy.

18:54.591 --> 18:55.633
I did not want
to fuck that bitch--

18:55.717 --> 18:56.843
Fuck you, man.

18:56.927 --> 18:57.885
What?

18:57.970 --> 18:59.178
Yo, chill out.

18:59.263 --> 19:00.638
Say that
one more time.

19:00.681 --> 19:01.681
He didn't mean
nothing by it.

19:01.765 --> 19:03.141
One more time!

19:03.183 --> 19:04.475
One more time
for what?

19:04.560 --> 19:06.310
What is going
on in here?

19:06.353 --> 19:08.062
Baby, are
you all right?

19:08.147 --> 19:09.480
I'm all right,
I'm all right.

19:09.565 --> 19:11.649
He pushed me
over the table.

19:11.733 --> 19:12.984
Why you do
that, Sean?

19:13.068 --> 19:14.652
What if he
hurt himself?

19:14.736 --> 19:16.154
No matter,
you always
take his side.

19:16.238 --> 19:18.072
This is not sides, baby.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.240
You coulda hurt your brother,
you coulda hurt yourself.

19:19.324 --> 19:21.159
It's nothing.

19:21.243 --> 19:22.869
It's over some girl he like
and I got her phone number

19:22.953 --> 19:25.621
and I asked him if he called
and he got mad.

19:27.207 --> 19:30.001
Sean, what
are you thinking?

19:30.043 --> 19:33.087
We got the biggest
game of your brother's
career coming up.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.673
Now what if he cut
himself on that glass.

19:35.757 --> 19:37.758
What if he didn't play
to his fullest

19:37.843 --> 19:40.178
in front of all the scouts
that we know are
gonna be there.

19:40.262 --> 19:43.764
Your actions affect
the entire family.

19:43.849 --> 19:47.894
I didn't mean it.
I'm sorry.

19:47.978 --> 19:49.187
(Deon)
It's all right.

19:49.229 --> 19:51.105
Don't worry about it.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.356
Sean.

19:52.399 --> 19:54.108
[rap music]

19:54.193 --> 19:56.194
[cheering]

20:05.871 --> 20:08.247
(coach)
Barnes!

20:12.502 --> 20:15.463
I don't need you
getting into any kind
of dick waving contest

20:15.547 --> 20:17.506
to see who can
lift the most weight.

20:17.591 --> 20:20.468
You gotta keep your
legs alive for Oregon
on Friday night.

20:20.552 --> 20:22.053
I'm focused
on the ball game, Coach.

20:22.137 --> 20:24.138
I'm not gonna
mess it up.
I promise.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.140
I believe you.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.892
But I don't want you in
here after another hour.

20:27.976 --> 20:30.561
One hour, you're done.
All right?

20:30.604 --> 20:31.646
I mean it.

20:31.730 --> 20:32.563
I'll be outta here.

20:32.648 --> 20:34.941
One hour.

20:47.120 --> 20:48.621
What the fuck
you doing in here

20:48.705 --> 20:50.831
with the regular
population, homie?

20:50.916 --> 20:52.792
Coach said
if he caught me
in the gym over an hour

20:52.834 --> 20:55.503
he'd kill me,
so I came over here.

20:55.587 --> 20:56.629
You wanna
lift weights?

20:56.713 --> 20:58.256
Just a few minutes.

21:01.593 --> 21:04.345
Yo, D. How much
you weighing there?

21:04.429 --> 21:05.763
216.

21:05.806 --> 21:07.515
Woo.

21:07.599 --> 21:10.101
Let's get this money,
big homie.

21:10.143 --> 21:13.521
Let's do this.
You gonna get far, baby.

21:13.605 --> 21:15.106
This is lightweight
for me.

21:15.148 --> 21:16.941
Let's make
it happen.

21:17.025 --> 21:20.278
One for the mansion,
two for the Maybach,

21:20.320 --> 21:23.030
three for the bitches,
four for the highlight.

21:23.115 --> 21:27.285
Five for the fame.
I said five for the fame.

21:27.369 --> 21:30.871
Man, you always got to go
all messed up.

21:30.956 --> 21:34.375
Man, you ran it on me.

21:34.459 --> 21:37.920
Boy, get mine.

21:43.760 --> 21:45.636
Oh, God.

21:45.679 --> 21:48.389
Hot hot damn.

21:48.473 --> 21:53.144
[laughing]

21:56.481 --> 21:58.733
What the fuck
you laughing at?

21:58.817 --> 22:01.360
What you get
mad at me for?

22:01.445 --> 22:05.990
Fuck this shit, man.
I'ma stay skinny.

22:06.074 --> 22:09.327
That way my dick
look bigger.

22:09.369 --> 22:11.370
The only Heisman trophy pose
I want to do

22:11.455 --> 22:13.664
is when I grab
a bitch purse.

22:13.749 --> 22:15.333
Get back, bitch!

22:15.417 --> 22:18.419
I'm outta here.
You can have
that shit.

22:39.816 --> 22:41.442
Hey.

22:41.526 --> 22:43.944
Hey, you think
you can give
me a spot?

22:44.029 --> 22:47.531
You want
me to spot you?

22:47.616 --> 22:49.200
Why not?

22:49.284 --> 22:51.952
Okay.

22:52.037 --> 22:53.371
Here comes
the muscle.

23:13.850 --> 23:16.102
Okay, you don't
need me so I'm
gonna go.

23:16.186 --> 23:17.728
[groan]
Help, help.

23:17.813 --> 23:18.813
Say please.

23:18.897 --> 23:20.314
Help, please.

23:20.399 --> 23:27.571
Please, baby,
help me.

23:27.656 --> 23:28.739
See, I did
need you.

23:28.782 --> 23:29.824
How was I?

23:29.908 --> 23:31.492
Great.

23:31.576 --> 23:32.993
It was
my first time.

23:33.078 --> 23:34.745
Your first time?

23:34.830 --> 23:35.830
Mm-hm.

23:44.631 --> 23:48.175
Twelve.
Thirteen.

23:48.260 --> 23:49.552
Fourteen.

23:49.636 --> 23:53.806
Hey, yo, D.
What up?

23:53.890 --> 23:57.017
You just can't be
busting up in here
like that.

23:57.102 --> 23:58.978
Your brother downstairs.
You want me to send him up?

23:59.062 --> 24:00.521
Tell him to
give me a minute.

24:00.605 --> 24:03.441
Right. You want me
to tell him ten?

24:03.483 --> 24:05.276
Tell him fifteen.

24:05.318 --> 24:07.862
I was sitting
right over here.

24:07.946 --> 24:09.113
I know, it's cool.

24:09.197 --> 24:10.823
Alright.

24:10.907 --> 24:12.491
Why'd you hit my head?

24:12.576 --> 24:14.702
"Oh, give me fifteen."

24:14.786 --> 24:17.037
- I was just playing.
- Forget about ten.

24:21.001 --> 24:23.711
Explained this happened, man.
Set that up, dog.

24:23.795 --> 24:25.546
It's going
down tonight.

24:25.630 --> 24:26.964
(Deon)
It was crazy.

24:27.007 --> 24:28.466
You okay?

24:28.508 --> 24:29.800
No problems.

24:29.885 --> 24:31.302
Give me a call
the next time

24:31.386 --> 24:32.553
you need help
with your homework.

24:32.637 --> 24:34.680
I'll do that.

24:34.764 --> 24:35.806
Hey, what's up?

24:35.849 --> 24:37.308
What's up?

24:37.350 --> 24:39.018
Who's that?

24:39.102 --> 24:41.312
It's my gyology tutor.

24:41.396 --> 24:42.730
Geology.

24:42.814 --> 24:44.815
Yeah, that.
Hey, how you doing?

24:44.900 --> 24:45.983
Hey.

24:46.067 --> 24:47.693
Sharon.

24:47.777 --> 24:49.904
I remember. Tickets.
I promised her tickets.

24:49.988 --> 24:51.280
Yo, June.

24:51.364 --> 24:53.032
What you
need, cuz?

24:53.116 --> 24:54.200
Those tickets
for my brother.

24:54.284 --> 24:55.701
Man, I don't know.

24:55.785 --> 24:57.453
What you mean
you don't know, man.

24:57.537 --> 24:59.538
I hope you
ain't rolled 'em
and smoked 'em.

24:59.623 --> 25:01.665
Come on, man.
Actually, you know
where they at?

25:01.750 --> 25:04.877
They right over there
on the desk, right
next to the computer.

25:10.550 --> 25:12.510
Where, I don't
see no--

25:12.552 --> 25:14.345
Right next to
the computer.

25:14.387 --> 25:17.598
I got it.
It was in
the drawer, man.

25:17.682 --> 25:20.601
Here. These are for
you and my brother.

25:20.685 --> 25:22.019
Thank you.

25:22.062 --> 25:23.771
It's nice to
see you again.

25:23.855 --> 25:25.856
You too.

25:25.941 --> 25:27.358
Thanks for
coming over.

25:27.400 --> 25:28.567
Alright. We'll
catch you later.

25:28.652 --> 25:30.611
Alright.

25:35.742 --> 25:38.202
I can't believe
he called her.

25:38.245 --> 25:39.453
You can't.

25:39.538 --> 25:43.207
Look at Sean.

25:43.250 --> 25:45.876
(June)
Yo, you tell 'em
June's popping party
extravaganzas

25:45.961 --> 25:48.128
is top notch.

25:48.213 --> 25:51.048
If they want the deluxe tent,
it's gonna be 2,000 dollars.

25:51.091 --> 25:54.760
It's set up time.
I'm not going in
that shit for free.

25:54.844 --> 25:56.303
That's money
outta my pocket.

25:56.388 --> 25:59.390
Where they do
that at? Damn, man!

25:59.432 --> 26:02.059
All these bitches want me
to throw these big-ass
parties after the game

26:02.102 --> 26:04.478
but don't nobody
want to pay for shit.

26:04.563 --> 26:07.481
They trying to
stress me son!

26:07.566 --> 26:10.109
Hey, don't be
hotboxing up
in my car, man.

26:10.193 --> 26:14.488
There you go,
acting like
Officer Ricky.

26:14.573 --> 26:16.657
[laughter]

26:16.741 --> 26:18.617
Chill out,
chill out for real,

26:18.702 --> 26:20.744
or you're gonna have us
in central booking.

26:33.842 --> 26:35.384
(Eric)
Harry, Harry,
why you trying

26:35.468 --> 26:36.594
to beat me up
on the price, man?

26:36.678 --> 26:38.721
This here is a classic.

26:38.805 --> 26:42.683
Oh, bullshit.
You know the blue book
price says 9,000 dollars.

26:42.767 --> 26:44.935
How about if
I give you eight?

26:44.978 --> 26:46.687
No, no, hey,
no, Harry,

26:46.771 --> 26:48.606
I--I put it
out for 10,000.

26:48.690 --> 26:50.190
I don't know if I can
take anything less
than that.

26:50.275 --> 26:51.775
Eight's a good
price for it.

26:51.860 --> 26:53.402
10,000.

26:53.486 --> 26:56.655
You told me you'd
give it to me
for 12.

26:56.740 --> 26:58.574
Who's this schmuck?

26:58.658 --> 27:01.160
I spoke to my mom.
She said she'd
co-sign a note.

27:01.244 --> 27:02.995
[laughing]
His mommy.

27:03.079 --> 27:05.623
Come on, you got
two men talking
business here.

27:05.707 --> 27:08.125
Huh? Kid.

27:08.168 --> 27:09.710
Alright, look, look.

27:09.794 --> 27:12.129
Uh, you just said
10,000 dollars, right?

27:12.213 --> 27:13.881
Is that what you want?

27:13.965 --> 27:15.924
You know how much
a car like this
is worth?

27:16.009 --> 27:18.636
I ain't never seen
a '66 Stingray
in this kind of shape.

27:18.678 --> 27:21.180
All you gotta do
is put some rims
on it, man,

27:21.264 --> 27:23.057
and a system in it,
ooh, you know--

27:23.141 --> 27:24.975
look, I'll give you
12-5 for it.

27:25.018 --> 27:26.894
What is going on here?
What, are you gonna let

27:26.978 --> 27:31.857
that Bob Marley here
outbid me on this car?
Come on.

27:31.941 --> 27:33.567
(woman)
Harry, for
Heaven's sakes,

27:33.652 --> 27:36.654
let the kid
have the car.

27:36.696 --> 27:40.157
You're too old
for it anyway.

27:40.241 --> 27:43.911
Wait a minute.

27:43.995 --> 27:47.414
Look, you know this
has always been my
dream car.

27:47.499 --> 27:51.835
Deon. What the
fuck you doing?

27:51.920 --> 27:55.464
I just want my roses
when I can still
smell 'em.

27:58.176 --> 28:02.930
I know, sweetie.
But it's only
a car.

28:03.014 --> 28:07.768
No, not for me.
Look, let me
handle this.

28:07.852 --> 28:11.689
Why don't you go
outside and enjoy
your minivan?

28:11.731 --> 28:13.357
It's what
you like.

28:13.441 --> 28:16.402
[sigh]

28:20.323 --> 28:22.199
I need this
deal, man.

28:27.247 --> 28:32.543
Alright. Look,
here's my final offer.

28:32.585 --> 28:35.629
11,000 dollars.

28:35.714 --> 28:38.799
I'll go get
my checkbook
right now.

28:38.883 --> 28:41.760
[sigh]
Deal?

28:41.845 --> 28:46.306
I'm sorry, kid.

28:46.391 --> 28:48.058
Man, this
is bullshit.

28:48.143 --> 28:50.227
Okay.

28:50.270 --> 28:52.229
I'll be right back.

28:52.272 --> 28:53.355
Excuse me.

28:58.236 --> 28:59.987
11,000 dollars.

29:00.071 --> 29:02.156
This--he's
a natural, man.

29:02.240 --> 29:03.949
Man.

29:04.033 --> 29:05.784
I had no idea you
were gonna do that, man.

29:05.869 --> 29:08.328
You see that?
11,000 dollars.

29:08.413 --> 29:10.122
But I don't get it.

29:10.206 --> 29:11.248
Doesn't the old guy
know he won't get
a chance

29:11.332 --> 29:13.083
to drive it long?

29:13.126 --> 29:14.793
Oh, he knows.

29:14.878 --> 29:20.215
Yeah. He just
wants to go out
on top.

29:21.926 --> 29:23.927
Alright.

29:23.970 --> 29:26.638
Tickets for you and
Mom, last game of
the season.

29:26.723 --> 29:28.182
Oh, good looking out.

29:28.266 --> 29:31.018
Ha, ha, ha.
Oh, that's my bro.

29:31.102 --> 29:33.020
Listen, don't go
passing the glory.

29:33.104 --> 29:34.521
I know, I know.

29:34.606 --> 29:36.607
Yo, I'm gonna run
back to campus.

29:36.649 --> 29:39.276
My ride better not
coming back smelling
like weed either.

29:39.319 --> 29:41.862
Oh, it ain't. But it
might smell like
sex, dog.

29:41.946 --> 29:44.823
He's stupid.

29:44.908 --> 29:46.450
Hey, you joggin back?

29:46.493 --> 29:48.118
Yeah.

29:48.203 --> 29:49.661
Okay, six minute miles,
keep your pace even.

29:49.746 --> 29:50.871
I know, I know.

29:50.955 --> 29:52.206
Okay, alright.

29:52.290 --> 29:56.502
Hey, hey.
11,000 dollars.

29:56.586 --> 29:57.920
You the man.

29:58.004 --> 29:59.797
From your mouth
to God's ears.

30:16.731 --> 30:18.565
Oh, what's up, Sharon?

30:18.650 --> 30:20.859
What are you doing
out here this late
by yourself?

30:20.944 --> 30:24.029
Just closing
the bookstore
for the night.

30:24.113 --> 30:25.572
How far you
live from here?

30:25.657 --> 30:27.032
A couple of blocks
down the quad.

30:27.116 --> 30:28.659
I'll walk with you.
C'mon.

30:28.743 --> 30:30.994
So Sean finally
called you.

30:31.037 --> 30:33.747
Yeah.

30:33.832 --> 30:35.582
What'd he say?

30:35.667 --> 30:37.376
Nothing, he just
offered to give
me the tickets

30:37.460 --> 30:40.254
and brought me over
and that was it.

30:40.338 --> 30:41.755
He didn't say
nothin' else?

30:41.840 --> 30:46.260
No. What was
he supposed
to say?

30:46.344 --> 30:51.265
I don't know.

30:51.349 --> 30:54.434
I appreciate
you walking
me home.

30:54.519 --> 30:55.978
It's nothing.
It's no problem.

31:02.527 --> 31:07.030
Okay, I have to
ask you something.

31:07.073 --> 31:10.617
Why'd you have your
brother call me
instead of you?

31:10.702 --> 31:12.536
I don't know.

31:12.579 --> 31:15.038
I mean, I
was busy.

31:15.081 --> 31:17.457
And it, you know,
he--I wanted to
make sure you came

31:17.542 --> 31:21.253
and he's good
with that kind
of stuff.

31:21.337 --> 31:30.137
Okay. Well, if you wanna
go out, you should
just ask me.

31:30.221 --> 31:34.099
Well, I'm asking
you now.

31:34.183 --> 31:36.226
Okay.

31:36.269 --> 31:37.728
Look at that
pretty smile.

31:51.159 --> 31:54.244
I didn't wake
you up, did I?

31:54.287 --> 32:00.751
I'm good.

32:00.835 --> 32:05.923
Got a seven o'clock
with Coach this morning.

32:06.007 --> 32:08.300
Wanna come
check me out?

32:08.384 --> 32:09.760
I'll be there.

32:14.432 --> 32:17.309
Now you make me
not wanna go.

32:17.393 --> 32:23.023
[kisses]

32:23.107 --> 32:25.984
See you

32:26.069 --> 32:29.529
(male announcer)
One minute, 39 seconds
left in the fourth quarter,

32:29.614 --> 32:33.367
[sports announcer
speaking]

32:33.451 --> 32:34.660

[players shouting
unintelligible]

32:50.218 --> 32:51.551
Alright.

32:51.636 --> 32:53.845
Ran the ball up the middle.

32:53.930 --> 32:57.557
No gain on the play,
that's gonna force
the fourth down.

33:00.728 --> 33:03.563
And the clock is ticking,
no time outs remaining.

33:03.648 --> 33:05.565
It's gotta
be frustrating
for the Lakers.

33:05.650 --> 33:07.818
Get past the gunner,
the gunner from
the left,

33:07.902 --> 33:09.236
we'll have a wall
for you. Feel me?

33:09.320 --> 33:10.654
Okay.
Got it.

33:10.697 --> 33:11.655
Get it!

The clock has stopped.

33:54.574 --> 33:56.241
(coach)
Let's go!

33:56.325 --> 33:58.160
Just 21 seconds
remaining in the game.

33:58.244 --> 33:59.119
Enough for two plays.

33:59.203 --> 34:01.038
Play, Deon.

34:01.080 --> 34:02.372
Deon!

34:02.457 --> 34:05.667
Come on, Deon,

34:36.824 --> 34:39.076
(Deon)
Damn.

34:39.159 --> 34:43.413
lncomplete pass to stop
the clock with 13
seconds remaining.

34:43.498 --> 34:46.833
Seems we can get
the fucking Gatorade.

34:46.918 --> 34:48.293
Bring it up!
Bring it up!

34:48.377 --> 34:50.212
Bring it in, fellas,
here we go.

34:50.295 --> 34:52.339
Let's go PA. Gator 92.
Let's buy protection up front.

34:52.422 --> 34:53.757
(Deon)
This is it, fellas.
Last chance.

34:53.841 --> 34:55.801
Yeah!

34:55.885 --> 34:57.844
Home town, baby, this is
where you do what you do.

34:57.929 --> 34:59.221
[shout]

35:04.143 --> 35:06.311

That's what I'm
talking about!

35:31.879 --> 35:34.131
[wild cheering]

35:34.215 --> 35:40.846
[announcer unintelligible]

35:46.602 --> 35:50.647
Yeah.
See that?
See that? That's it.

35:55.153 --> 35:57.946
[players chanting]

36:05.037 --> 36:08.039
[chanting continues]

36:08.124 --> 36:12.002
We just won, but we
wouldn't have if you
hadn't caught them passes.

36:12.044 --> 36:13.378
Don't touch me,
boy, alright?

36:13.462 --> 36:15.005
You didn't even
wash up yet.

36:15.089 --> 36:16.882
[chuckling]

36:16.966 --> 36:18.550
Oh, shit.

36:18.634 --> 36:20.760
Hey, D!

36:20.845 --> 36:23.763
[shouting]

36:26.976 --> 36:28.351
Deon!

36:28.436 --> 36:30.187
[distant ambulance siren]

36:30.229 --> 36:34.107
(Deon)
Is anyone there?

36:34.192 --> 36:36.943
[echoing]
Can anyone hear me?

36:37.028 --> 36:39.779
Is anyone there?

36:39.864 --> 36:42.949
(doctor over mic]
Relax, Deon, you
have to stay still.

36:43.034 --> 36:44.784
[clack]

36:44.869 --> 36:47.287
[humming]

36:47.371 --> 36:50.290
Can I get you
something, baby?

36:50.374 --> 36:52.250
I'm okay.

36:52.335 --> 36:57.881
What could they be doing?
We've been here all day.

36:57.965 --> 36:59.382
[scoffing]

36:59.425 --> 37:02.469
Sean, go find
somebody, please.

37:02.553 --> 37:05.305
Momma, I already
checked. They're busy.

37:05.389 --> 37:07.641
Look, just go out there
and bring somebody back

37:07.725 --> 37:10.310
who knows
what the hell
is going on.

37:10.394 --> 37:13.480
Please?

37:13.564 --> 37:14.981
What'd I tell ya?

37:15.066 --> 37:16.733
What?

37:16.817 --> 37:19.903
I told you to get
your ass in that
endzone.

37:19.987 --> 37:21.738
Guess what, Bernie?

37:21.822 --> 37:23.949
SportsNet just bumped
your boy up.

37:24.033 --> 37:25.909
That means we're
going to San Diego,

37:25.952 --> 37:29.579
Denver or Miami.

37:29.664 --> 37:31.164
[whooping]

37:31.249 --> 37:33.083
We moving!

37:33.167 --> 37:36.169
Look, we gotta
you outta here,
get you all fixed up.

37:36.254 --> 37:37.671
Miami!

37:37.755 --> 37:39.005
[whooping]

37:39.090 --> 37:40.715
Oh, baby.

37:40.800 --> 37:42.509
(Doctor)
I'm sorry
I took so long.

37:42.593 --> 37:44.594
Oh, that's okay,
Doctor. What you
got for us?

37:44.679 --> 37:48.014
We got the M Rl
results and what it's
showing is a growth,

37:48.099 --> 37:51.101
a medio-spinal tumor
in your chest cavity.

37:51.143 --> 37:53.979
And that 's putting
stress on your heart
and your lungs,

37:54.063 --> 37:55.772
and that's
why you fainted.

37:55.856 --> 37:57.315
What does
that mean?

37:57.400 --> 37:59.609
[stammers]
But can he
still play?

37:59.694 --> 38:02.362
He's playing in the
national championships.

38:02.446 --> 38:05.824
At--at this time,
with the placement
of the tumor

38:05.908 --> 38:08.785
any kind of physical
activity could cause
more damage.

38:08.828 --> 38:10.328
Can we have
it removed?

38:10.413 --> 38:12.622
Our preference would
be non-invasive.

38:12.665 --> 38:14.374
Radiation
and chemotherapy

38:14.458 --> 38:16.918
will shrink
the tumor.

38:17.003 --> 38:19.629
What I think we have to do
is we gotta take a wait
and see approach.

38:19.714 --> 38:22.299
We gotta
start chemotherapy
though immediately.

38:22.383 --> 38:23.758
And then within
the next four months

38:23.843 --> 38:28.888
we'll see
where we're at.

38:28.973 --> 38:32.058
Okay? I'll
give you some time.

38:32.143 --> 38:34.311
Excuse me for a second.

38:38.065 --> 38:42.152
We'll work through this.
It'll be alright.

38:42.236 --> 38:43.903
(Eric)
Hey, Doc.

38:43.988 --> 38:46.906
Excuse me for
a minute, Doc,
Doc, hold it.

38:46.991 --> 38:49.200
Do you know who
that is in there?

38:49.285 --> 38:50.869
No, he--

38:50.953 --> 38:52.329
That boy has a future.
He has a gift.

38:52.413 --> 38:54.164
The N FL draft is
not until June.

38:54.206 --> 38:55.332
Are you saying
we can expect a
full recovery

38:55.374 --> 38:57.042
by April or May?

38:57.126 --> 38:58.335
We'll know more
once we see how
his body

38:58.419 --> 38:59.669
reacts to
the treatment.

38:59.754 --> 39:01.087
Chemo and radiation?

39:01.172 --> 39:02.547
Hold on,
that's six months.

39:02.631 --> 39:04.549
You said it would
just take four.

39:04.633 --> 39:06.551
It's always best to
remain optimistic,
don't you think?

39:06.635 --> 39:08.720
Now look, Doc,
I know how the
game's played.

39:08.804 --> 39:09.888
We're just a
little worried.

39:09.972 --> 39:11.890
Eric, please don't--

39:11.974 --> 39:13.558
We are. But all
this stuff is just
between the family.

39:13.642 --> 39:15.977
I need to know it's
not leaving this room.

39:16.062 --> 39:20.106
The hospital maintains the
strictest confidentiality.
He'll be okay, okay?

39:20.191 --> 39:21.399
Thank you, Doctor.

39:21.484 --> 39:22.942
Uh-huh.

39:30.284 --> 39:33.536
Alright, we gotta
keep a lid on this
bullshit, okay?

39:33.579 --> 39:35.747
So we're gonna
tell them you
got pneumonia.

39:35.831 --> 39:37.791
No one has to know
the truth but us.

39:37.875 --> 39:39.417
It does not
leave this room.

39:39.502 --> 39:41.503
No, no, I don't agree
with that, I mean,

39:41.587 --> 39:43.588
we might as well tell
them anyway because
they will find out.

39:43.672 --> 39:46.049
Bernie, I can deal
with Coach Harper
and the university.

39:46.092 --> 39:48.093
What about Miami?
What about the Dolphins?

39:48.177 --> 39:50.595
It's not a
physical limitation.

39:50.679 --> 39:52.472
Worst case scenario,
you're gonna be dropped down
to 9th or 10th or 11th pick.

39:52.556 --> 39:54.224
But you'll still
be first rate.

39:54.266 --> 39:56.142
You'll be okay.

39:56.227 --> 39:57.477
Listen, I know the
championships are
in two weeks,

39:57.561 --> 39:59.229
but you know what?

39:59.271 --> 40:00.939
What those people saw
you do the other night,

40:01.023 --> 40:02.273
they will
not forget you.
I promise you that.

40:02.358 --> 40:03.650
I promise you that.

40:03.734 --> 40:04.859
(Eric)
That's right.

40:16.914 --> 40:21.084
(male professor)
1969, the
summer of love.

40:21.168 --> 40:23.169
So I've been told.

40:23.254 --> 40:27.674
America is
the first country
to land a man on the moon,

40:27.758 --> 40:30.343
and at that same time,
we're number one
in education.

40:30.428 --> 40:33.012
Now, we're
number 18.

40:33.097 --> 40:35.849
And as more and
more jobs require

40:35.933 --> 40:38.101
a college education,
fewer and fewer of us

40:38.185 --> 40:39.853
are actually
graduating from college.

40:39.937 --> 40:41.938
ln the year 2040,
ladies and gentlemen,

40:42.022 --> 40:45.525
China will be the big player,
the big dog, America not.

40:45.609 --> 40:47.527
So where are all
these new jobs
going to be

40:47.611 --> 40:49.529
when you graduate
in the spring?

40:49.613 --> 40:51.364
I would like you all to
come to Thursday's class

40:51.449 --> 40:54.284
prepared to
discuss that. Okay?

40:54.368 --> 40:56.536
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.
See you Thursday.

40:56.620 --> 40:58.371
Be prepared.

40:58.456 --> 41:00.165
Thank you.
Thank you.

41:02.543 --> 41:04.169
Hey, stranger.

41:04.253 --> 41:05.170
Hey, Sharon.

41:05.254 --> 41:06.963
Hey.

41:07.006 --> 41:09.799
Look, this is kinda
awkward but--

41:09.884 --> 41:11.801
I've been trying
to call your brother
for the past couple of days

41:11.886 --> 41:13.845
but I haven't
heard back from him.

41:13.929 --> 41:16.139
Everybody's saying
he's got pneumonia.

41:16.182 --> 41:17.307
Is he alright?

41:17.391 --> 41:19.601
Yeah.

41:22.980 --> 41:25.482
You don't like talking
about your brother
much, do you?

41:25.524 --> 41:28.401
I think he can talk
better for himself.

41:28.486 --> 41:30.820
Fair enough.

41:30.863 --> 41:32.906
So, what's
up with you?

41:32.990 --> 41:34.741
I'm on my way
to the crew lab,

41:34.825 --> 41:36.242
working on my resume.

41:36.327 --> 41:38.036
Oh, well,
show it to me.

41:38.120 --> 41:39.496
Why?

41:39.580 --> 41:41.498
'Cause I got
some resume skills.

41:41.582 --> 41:43.666
No, for real.
I look at a lot.

41:43.709 --> 41:44.876
Alright, look--

41:44.960 --> 41:46.544
Let's see
what you got.

41:46.629 --> 41:52.008
Don't clown 'cause
it's not finished yet.

41:53.135 --> 41:54.928
What?

41:55.012 --> 41:56.930
You interned
for a designer
in New York City?

41:57.014 --> 41:59.349
Yeah. I've always
wanted to be in fashion,

41:59.433 --> 42:01.434
so I took a chance
and went to New York.

42:01.519 --> 42:04.854
Okay, well,
I'd move it
up on your resume.

42:04.939 --> 42:08.525
Alright, you might know
a little something
about resumes.

42:08.609 --> 42:10.527
Yeah, I think I do.

42:13.197 --> 42:14.531
Can't you give me
pills or something
instead of that?

42:14.615 --> 42:16.074
He needs
to relax.

42:16.158 --> 42:18.159
I told you he
doesn't like needles.

42:24.667 --> 42:29.087
Come on, Deon,
you gotta do
this now.

42:29.171 --> 42:31.464
You remember when
you was six years old,

42:31.549 --> 42:34.384
and we had
that big thunderstorm,

42:34.426 --> 42:36.052
scared you so much
you hid under the bed

42:36.136 --> 42:37.595
you thought it was
the wrath of God?

42:37.680 --> 42:39.097
That was
a long time ago.

42:39.181 --> 42:40.807
I know, baby,
I know, but listen.

42:40.891 --> 42:43.393
Do you remember
what I told you then?

42:43.435 --> 42:46.062
I told you there
was nothing to
be afraid of,

42:46.105 --> 42:47.981
that it wasn't
God punishing you,

42:48.065 --> 42:49.482
that he was trying to
give you something.

42:49.567 --> 42:51.943
All that lightning
and thunder,

42:52.027 --> 42:54.904
light so
bright you could
see inside your eye?

42:54.989 --> 42:56.573
What'd I tell you?

42:56.615 --> 43:01.286
It was God giving
you superpowers.

43:01.370 --> 43:02.870
I remember.

43:02.955 --> 43:08.293
Yeah. So now,
I want you to
lay back.

43:08.377 --> 43:10.920
Lay back.
Come on.

43:11.005 --> 43:14.007
That's right.
Just relax.

43:14.091 --> 43:17.176
Close your eyes.

43:17.261 --> 43:20.179
And let God
bathe you in
His light.

43:20.264 --> 43:23.349
Absorb the power.

43:23.434 --> 43:27.812
Okay. Okay,
just lay down.
That's right.

43:27.896 --> 43:29.689
Close your eyes now.

43:29.773 --> 43:34.444
Take something scary
and turn it into
a strength.

43:34.528 --> 43:39.365
And the next day,
oh, I can still
see your little face.

43:39.450 --> 43:44.037
You marched out
onto that football field
with those super powers

43:44.121 --> 43:48.124
like you could fly
over anybody and land
in the end zone.

43:48.167 --> 43:49.959
Like you could run
like the wind

43:50.044 --> 43:52.128
and never get caught.

43:52.171 --> 43:54.464
And I was
just screaming.

43:54.506 --> 43:56.883
Come on, D,
come on.

43:56.967 --> 44:01.387
Use your super powers.
Use your super powers.

44:01.472 --> 44:06.643
[angry shouting]

44:06.685 --> 44:08.895
(Mom)
I am disappointed
in you!

44:08.979 --> 44:11.522
[angry shouting]

44:14.234 --> 44:17.320
[shouting continues]

44:20.658 --> 44:22.825
You are not my son!

44:22.910 --> 44:26.746
[shouting continues]

44:26.830 --> 44:30.667
[equipment beeping]

44:44.932 --> 44:46.766
Excuse me.

44:46.850 --> 44:48.893
Excuse me,
I told you
on the phone,

44:48.977 --> 44:51.020
we can't continue
like this.

44:51.105 --> 44:53.022
We are following the
treatment plan that
you signed off on.

44:53.065 --> 44:55.108
No, these costs
are out of control.

44:55.192 --> 44:58.361
We are going to need
an updated credit card
on file for you.

44:58.404 --> 44:59.696
For what?

44:59.780 --> 45:01.197
Any ancillary
charges that--

45:01.240 --> 45:04.075
Oh, ancillary charges
like...

45:04.159 --> 45:07.120
129 dollars for
a mucus recovery system?

45:07.204 --> 45:08.705
Fees like that
are often charged.

45:08.789 --> 45:12.709
It's a damn
box of Kleenex.

45:12.793 --> 45:14.711
Now I am not giving
you another credit card

45:14.753 --> 45:16.421
and I'm not signing
any of your papers

45:16.505 --> 45:18.214
until somebody
in this administration

45:18.298 --> 45:20.383
explains to me why
I have to take out
a loan

45:20.426 --> 45:26.764
to cover the costs
of buying Band-Aids
and gauze pads!

45:26.849 --> 45:28.307
I'll provide my own.

45:30.269 --> 45:32.395
I will provide
my own.

45:32.479 --> 45:35.648
Excuse me, Doc, Doc,
do you know where
Dr. Brintall is?

45:35.733 --> 45:37.233
I'm covering
for him but--

45:37.276 --> 45:39.235
Oh, you cover
for me, listen, listen.

45:39.278 --> 45:41.320
Deon Barnes. We brought
him in four months ago.

45:41.405 --> 45:43.406
He's a football player.
We did the chemotherapy,

45:43.490 --> 45:45.992
radiation, all that,
and it cost us a great
deal of money.

45:46.076 --> 45:47.744
Oh, I don't get
into billing issues.

45:47.786 --> 45:49.412
Wait, hold
on, then.

45:49.455 --> 45:50.955
When we brought him in,
he was 214 pounds.

45:51.039 --> 45:52.915
Now he little
and skinny.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.751
We trying to get
this boy ready for
the N FL draft.

45:54.835 --> 45:56.753
All he does
is sleep all day.

45:56.837 --> 45:58.838
Well, in aggressive cases
like his that's
not uncommon.

45:58.922 --> 46:01.257
It's a side effect
of his radiation.

46:01.300 --> 46:03.009
What you need to do
is get him out of bed,

46:03.093 --> 46:04.469
get him active
and see how he feels.

46:04.553 --> 46:05.678
That's the best
thing right now.

46:05.763 --> 46:06.804
Oh, but he--

46:12.644 --> 46:15.938
(Mom)
Home sweet
home, baby doll.

46:16.023 --> 46:17.398
Now you stay
right there.

46:17.483 --> 46:21.277
I'll come around
and get you.

46:21.320 --> 46:24.113
Okay. Okay,
take your time.

46:28.452 --> 46:29.869
There we go.

46:29.953 --> 46:34.290
Alright.

46:34.374 --> 46:35.917
Here we go.

46:36.001 --> 46:37.168
(kid)
Oh, look!
It's Deon.

46:37.252 --> 46:40.046
[kids greeting]

46:40.130 --> 46:42.048
They're so happy
to see you.

46:42.132 --> 46:44.717
He's gonna play
with you later.

46:44.802 --> 46:46.844
Okay?

46:48.305 --> 46:49.764
Okay, come here.

46:52.142 --> 46:53.851
[inaudible]

47:03.362 --> 47:06.572
I'll get this.

47:06.657 --> 47:07.740
There.

47:15.624 --> 47:18.668
I'll take your
shoes off.

47:18.752 --> 47:21.504
Okay.

47:21.588 --> 47:25.675
Oh, I--
I talked to Sean.

47:25.759 --> 47:31.931
He called.

47:32.015 --> 47:36.853
Wait, I'll help you.

47:39.439 --> 47:42.441
Alright.

47:42.526 --> 47:45.778
I'll get you
in there.

47:45.863 --> 47:48.239
Alright.

47:48.323 --> 47:50.116
There you go.

47:50.200 --> 47:52.285
You want some of that
ginger ale with
crushed ice

47:52.369 --> 47:53.786
like you had
in the hospital?

47:53.871 --> 47:55.454
Hm.

47:55.539 --> 47:58.082
It's good for your
stomach, right?

47:58.166 --> 48:01.127
I'll be right back.

48:24.484 --> 48:27.445
(Mom)
The interviewer
made me so nervous.

48:27.529 --> 48:29.572
How did
the interview go?

48:29.615 --> 48:31.574
They had me meet
with the supervisor

48:31.658 --> 48:34.660
and her direct
manager, and
I was there

48:34.745 --> 48:36.746
for over
three hours.

48:36.788 --> 48:38.664
Oh, well,
that's good.
Yeah! Real good.

48:38.749 --> 48:40.249
Well, that
was a lot.

48:40.334 --> 48:41.792
I think they
liked me.

48:41.877 --> 48:43.669
What's not to like.

48:43.754 --> 48:45.880
I mean, worst
case scenario,
you know.

48:45.964 --> 48:47.673
If it doesn't work
out, there's a position
over at the dealership.

48:47.758 --> 48:49.467
I mean, it's
not fashion, but--

48:49.551 --> 48:51.594
Sean, it is so nice
to get a job for Sharon.

48:51.637 --> 48:53.512
I would appreciate
that 'cause--

48:53.597 --> 48:55.640
Hey, D, go ahead
and eat your food.

48:55.724 --> 48:57.099
I'm almost half
done with mine.

48:57.184 --> 49:00.102
Eric, if he's
not hungry--

49:00.187 --> 49:03.272
you don't have
to eat, Deon, okay?

49:03.315 --> 49:05.483
But I did make
some of that pecan pie.

49:05.567 --> 49:06.692
You want some?

49:06.777 --> 49:08.110
Pecan pie everybody?

49:08.195 --> 49:09.820
I love pecan pie.

49:15.786 --> 49:18.955
Bernie, you gotta
at least let him
get his own stuff.

49:18.997 --> 49:20.456
I mean, he's been
home for two weeks.

49:20.540 --> 49:21.874
He's just been
sitting on his ass.

49:21.959 --> 49:23.542
Look, you have
to be patient.

49:23.627 --> 49:25.211
It takes time.
I know Deon.

49:25.295 --> 49:27.463
He's going to do things
in his own time.

49:27.547 --> 49:29.674
He goes to take a dump,
you're there to help him.

49:29.758 --> 49:31.092
Okay, that's disgusting,
that's enough.

49:31.176 --> 49:32.677
I don't feel like
hearing that.

49:32.761 --> 49:34.971
Look, the cancer
knocked him down.

49:35.055 --> 49:36.681
We just have to
be patient.

49:36.765 --> 49:38.224
It's not how many times
you get knocked down.

49:38.308 --> 49:40.267
It's how many times
you get back up.

49:40.352 --> 49:42.269
Would you please stop
with that ra-ra football
bullshit?

49:42.354 --> 49:44.313
I know my boy,
I know he's gonna
be okay.

49:44.356 --> 49:46.816
He's not a boy.
And you can't teach
him how to be a man.

49:46.858 --> 49:48.901
The goddamn president
of the United States
was raised by a woman.

49:48.986 --> 49:50.569
Barack Obama
was raised
by single mothers.

49:50.654 --> 49:52.697
He don't play
football, do he?

49:52.781 --> 49:55.157
He play basketball.
Shut the--.

49:55.242 --> 49:58.452
Look, get the pecan pie.
I'll get the dishes.

50:01.331 --> 50:02.915
I have finals
and stuff

50:03.000 --> 50:04.917
so I think I'll
be heading out.

50:05.002 --> 50:05.876
I'll walk you out.

50:05.961 --> 50:08.504
I got it.

50:08.547 --> 50:14.677
[groan]

50:14.720 --> 50:17.430
Sorry about that.
That was embarrassing.

50:17.514 --> 50:19.557
No, no,
it's all good.

50:19.641 --> 50:22.518
They're all trying
to help you from
their own perspective.

50:22.561 --> 50:24.186
What about you?

50:24.271 --> 50:25.855
What about me?

50:25.939 --> 50:29.025
Things different now
that I got sick?

50:29.067 --> 50:31.944
No. It's been tough.

50:32.029 --> 50:33.404
It's just--

50:33.488 --> 50:35.614
You interested
in somebody else?

50:35.699 --> 50:37.700
Not at all.

50:37.743 --> 50:39.577
I've just got--
[cell phone rings]

50:39.661 --> 50:42.705
I'm sorry.

50:45.292 --> 50:46.792
It's my mother.

50:46.877 --> 50:48.419
I'll call you later.

50:48.503 --> 50:49.420
Okay.

51:12.903 --> 51:29.585
[groan]

51:29.628 --> 51:30.920
Two.

51:31.004 --> 51:33.089
(Mom)
Deon!

51:33.173 --> 51:35.424
Seventeen.

51:35.467 --> 51:36.884
Eighteen.

51:36.968 --> 51:40.012
[clapping]
That is great!

51:40.097 --> 51:41.806
[groan]

51:41.890 --> 51:44.683
You couldn't even
do that this time
last week.

51:44.768 --> 51:47.937
Look, I just came
to apologize.

51:48.021 --> 51:50.189
Eric acted
so damn crazy.

51:50.273 --> 51:53.776
You know, fussing
in front of--Sharon
and everything.

51:57.114 --> 51:58.614
Do you like her?

51:58.698 --> 52:02.034
[chuckle]

52:02.119 --> 52:03.536
Yeah.

52:06.706 --> 52:09.125
I see you
boxed up the TV.

52:09.167 --> 52:12.378
Well, we just
have to send some
of this stuff back,

52:12.462 --> 52:15.965
that's all. It's
just a delay.

52:16.007 --> 52:18.467
I know how much
you like that
flat screen.

52:18.552 --> 52:23.305
I do but it's just
a hiccup, that's all.

52:23.348 --> 52:25.850
Sweetheart, you gonna get
better in your own time

52:25.934 --> 52:29.186
and we gonna get rid
of this crappy ass
little house

52:29.271 --> 52:31.564
and we gonna be
down in Miami,

52:31.648 --> 52:33.649
livin' it, honey.

52:33.733 --> 52:39.572
And we gonna get
everything we deserve
in life, you'll see.

52:39.656 --> 52:44.243
I'm sorry, Ma.

52:44.327 --> 52:46.162
I didn't mean
to get sick.

52:46.204 --> 52:48.914
Oh, sweetie.
Don't apologize
for that.

52:48.999 --> 52:50.583
What you sayin'?

52:50.667 --> 52:54.003
I don't know why
this is happening.

52:54.045 --> 52:57.423
I mean, I didn't do nothing
to nobody, I didn't
do anything.

52:57.507 --> 53:02.428
Well--it's a challenge.

53:02.512 --> 53:05.514
It's just another
challenge, that's all.

53:05.557 --> 53:07.558
And you will be fine.

53:07.642 --> 53:14.440
We will be fine,
I promise you.

53:14.524 --> 53:16.358
Why is God
doing this to me?

53:16.443 --> 53:19.486
Oh, no, no.
Don't say that,
sweetheart. Don't.

53:19.571 --> 53:26.202
[both weep]

53:26.244 --> 53:29.246
[phone ringing]

53:29.331 --> 53:30.247
[beep]

53:30.332 --> 53:31.957
Hello?

53:32.042 --> 53:33.667
(Mom)
Hey, baby.
What's up?

53:33.752 --> 53:35.294
Hey, Momma.
I'm just
checking out

53:35.378 --> 53:37.546
the status of
some applications.

53:37.589 --> 53:39.465
I thought you said the
party was supposed
to end early.

53:39.549 --> 53:42.551
Well, it was, but
one of my servers
didn't show up.

53:42.636 --> 53:44.136
So I had
to fill in.

53:44.221 --> 53:45.387
I've been on
my feet all night.

53:45.472 --> 53:47.473
[laughs]

53:47.557 --> 53:49.725
I can stop and
get some pizza.
What do you want?

53:49.768 --> 53:51.894
Oh, I'm the
only one home.

53:51.937 --> 53:53.229
Eric and Deon
aren't here.

53:53.313 --> 53:54.730
They're not there?

53:54.773 --> 53:56.565
Well, where the
hell did they go?

53:56.650 --> 53:58.943
I don't know.
They haven't been
here for hours.

53:59.027 --> 54:00.986
I called both
their phones
but nobody answers.

54:01.071 --> 54:03.489
Look, just meet
me outside in
five minutes.

54:03.573 --> 54:04.490
I'll be right there.

54:04.574 --> 54:05.574
Okay.

54:05.617 --> 54:07.076
Bye.

54:07.118 --> 54:08.244
[beep]

54:14.584 --> 54:16.085
How long ago
did they leave?

54:16.169 --> 54:18.254
I don't know.
Hours ago, Ma.

54:18.338 --> 54:21.006
Oh, Lord.

54:21.091 --> 54:23.592
Damn. What's your
brother's cell
phone number?

54:23.635 --> 54:26.637
Oh, it's in the phone.
It's in the phone.

54:26.721 --> 54:29.932
Ma.
Mom, look!

54:29.975 --> 54:32.142
What the hell
is he doin'?

54:32.227 --> 54:34.311
Jesus. Pull over.
Just pull over.

54:34.396 --> 54:36.855
Look at that time,
44 seconds, that
ain't shit!

54:36.940 --> 54:38.857
My grandmother could
do that in her wheelchair!

54:38.942 --> 54:40.442
I'm trying.

54:40.485 --> 54:41.902
Get those knees up.
Don't try, do it!

54:41.987 --> 54:43.612
You gotta get them.
Go get them.

54:43.655 --> 54:44.947
Everything you ever
wanted is on the line.

54:44.990 --> 54:46.073
(Mom)
Eric!

54:46.157 --> 54:47.700
It's do or die time.

54:47.784 --> 54:48.784
You don't have
to do that,
Deon! Stop!

54:48.868 --> 54:49.743
Deon!

54:49.828 --> 54:51.161
No, no, no.

54:51.246 --> 54:52.246
Don't you fucking
look at them!

54:52.330 --> 54:54.123
I gotta get him!

54:54.165 --> 54:56.083
(Eric)
Don't let them
distract you.

54:56.167 --> 54:58.127
Oh, you want a break?
You wanna run
to Momma?

54:58.169 --> 55:00.087
You wanna cry to your mother
or you wanna play football?

55:00.171 --> 55:01.630
Show me something, Deon.
Show me something!

55:01.715 --> 55:03.048
Eric!

55:03.133 --> 55:05.175
Bernie. Now
you guys stop.

55:05.260 --> 55:06.844
You have no idea
what it takes
to win.

55:06.928 --> 55:09.680
You want it, you gotta
show me something.

55:09.764 --> 55:12.474
You stop it!
Eric! You're
gonna kill him!

55:12.559 --> 55:14.476
- Don't do this!
- He needs to do this!

55:14.561 --> 55:16.603
- What is wrong with you?
- He has got to do this.

55:16.688 --> 55:18.397
- That's enough!
- He's got to do this
on his own.

55:18.481 --> 55:19.857
Bee, you got
no idea!
This is it!

55:19.941 --> 55:21.400
He's passing out!

55:23.486 --> 55:29.658
[indistinct]

55:29.743 --> 55:32.578
(male)
Sorry, guys, you're gonna
have to wait back here.

55:32.662 --> 55:34.330
[distant murmur]

55:50.347 --> 55:52.890
(doctor)
Seems Deon was
working late tonight.

55:52.974 --> 55:56.185
Your son, he had a--
a heart arrhythmia,

55:56.227 --> 55:58.520
and that depleted
him of his oxygen.

55:58.605 --> 55:59.938
Is he gonna
be okay?

56:00.023 --> 56:01.357
Yeah, he's stablized
for now.

56:01.441 --> 56:03.650
What the hell happened?

56:03.735 --> 56:05.778
Because the specialist
on duty said we need to
get him up and active.

56:05.862 --> 56:08.447
Now he's got pro football
tryouts in less than
a month.

56:08.531 --> 56:11.950
Professional football?
You kidding me?

56:12.035 --> 56:14.078
He can't play football.
He's got a tumor

56:14.162 --> 56:16.955
a centimeter away
from his heart.

56:17.040 --> 56:20.959
Your son, he's never
ever gonna become a
professional athlete.

56:21.044 --> 56:23.545
He's lucky if he
ever rides a
bike again.

56:28.385 --> 56:31.595
You did this.

56:31.679 --> 56:33.722
You did this!

56:40.647 --> 56:42.064
These motherfuckers
don't know shit!

56:42.148 --> 56:43.899
Everything they
told us was wrong.

56:43.942 --> 56:45.984
We oughtta sue
that hospital
for malpractice.

56:46.069 --> 56:47.319
We should
sue the university.

56:47.404 --> 56:48.821
They tested him
every year.

56:48.905 --> 56:50.364
They had to know
this was coming.

56:50.448 --> 56:52.116
That would call
for lawyers, Eric.

56:52.200 --> 56:53.909
Lawyers cost money.
Who's gonna pay for that?

56:53.993 --> 56:55.661
What you trying to say?
I didn't pay for shit?

56:55.745 --> 56:57.079
I leveraged my
garage, baby.

56:57.163 --> 56:58.622
I could lose
my business.

56:58.706 --> 57:00.416
I put it on
the line for
your son.

57:00.500 --> 57:01.917
Please don't talk to me
about money when they're

57:01.960 --> 57:03.502
about to foreclose on
this house.

57:03.586 --> 57:05.587
Everybody knows about
your little dream

57:05.672 --> 57:08.006
to ride on my son's coat
tails for the fame
you didn't get.

57:08.091 --> 57:09.633
Your little dream
to manage my son.

57:09.717 --> 57:11.510
Well, Eric there's
nobody to manage now.

57:11.594 --> 57:13.220
Who you gonna
manage now?

57:13.304 --> 57:15.305
Know when the best
times of my life were?

57:15.390 --> 57:16.598
When I was on
that football field.

57:16.641 --> 57:18.851
I don't care.

57:18.935 --> 57:20.602
I wanted your boy
to have something
good to look back on.

57:20.687 --> 57:22.187
I'm tired of all your
loser football stories.

57:22.272 --> 57:23.939
Every step of the way,
you blocked me.

57:24.023 --> 57:26.108
He coulda done it.
He had the talent.

57:26.192 --> 57:28.110
And remember,
when you ran off
his real daddy,

57:28.153 --> 57:30.529
truth be told,
I was there.

57:30.613 --> 57:34.158
If that man couldn't see
that he had two beautiful
sons and a beautiful wife,

57:34.242 --> 57:36.201
that was his
goddamn problem.

57:36.286 --> 57:38.537
Now let me tell
you something.

57:38.621 --> 57:40.789
Me and my sons were fine
long before you came
into this mix

57:40.832 --> 57:43.167
and we'll be fine
long after you leave.

57:43.251 --> 57:44.960
So you can just hit
the road right now

57:45.003 --> 57:46.879
because it's empty.
There's no money.

57:46.963 --> 57:48.797
Overdrawn,
insufficient funds.

57:48.840 --> 57:50.883
There's no pot of gold
at the end of this rainbow,

57:50.967 --> 57:51.967
so get the fuck
outta here!

57:52.010 --> 57:52.968
Okay!

57:53.052 --> 57:54.678
I'm right here!

57:54.762 --> 57:56.889
You talking about me
like I'm dead already.

57:56.973 --> 57:58.515
I'll pay this back.

57:58.600 --> 58:00.851
I'll find
a way to pay
everybody back.

58:00.935 --> 58:02.144
I'll find a way.

58:11.779 --> 58:13.530
[door opens
and closes]

58:20.330 --> 58:24.041
Hey, I have
an appointment to
see Steve Fisk.

58:28.755 --> 58:30.047
[knocking]

58:30.131 --> 58:31.256
Stephen?

58:31.341 --> 58:32.549
That's me.
You are?

58:32.634 --> 58:33.884
Deon.

58:33.968 --> 58:35.427
Deon, please
have a seat.

58:35.512 --> 58:37.554
What's your last name
and student I D?

58:37.639 --> 58:41.225
Barnes.
Zero five
one five.

58:41.309 --> 58:44.686
I'm sorry, zero
two five one five.

58:44.771 --> 58:48.357
Barnes, Barnes.
Deon Barnes.

58:48.441 --> 58:51.026
You know we used to have
this all star football
player by that same name.

58:51.110 --> 58:53.445
Had an ego
the size of Texas.

58:58.368 --> 58:59.868
Oh, man.

58:59.911 --> 59:02.246
Listen, I'm sorry
about that.

59:02.330 --> 59:04.540
Yeah, just tell me
what I gotta do to
graduate, alright?

59:04.624 --> 59:09.628
Well--it appears
as though you never
actually declared a major.

59:09.712 --> 59:12.214
GPA's at the minimum.

59:12.298 --> 59:14.883
But you dropped out
during fall semester.

59:14.926 --> 59:17.594
Probably looking
at the full two years.

59:17.679 --> 59:21.390
It's--here
are some
financial aid forms.

59:21.432 --> 59:22.891
See if you can have
those completed and
back to me

59:22.976 --> 59:24.977
later this week, alright?

59:25.061 --> 59:29.439
Financial aid funds?
I'm on a scholarship.

59:29.524 --> 59:32.401
Come on, Julio,
my granddaughter
can run faster than that.

59:32.443 --> 59:35.237
Get the piano off
your back, Jonas!

59:35.321 --> 59:38.740
Let's go!
[indistinct] stride out!

59:38.825 --> 59:42.452
Listen, I heard you
revoked my scholarship.

59:42.537 --> 59:44.454
I didn't have any choice.

59:44.539 --> 59:46.999
Once you dropped
out of school,
it was an NCAA thing.

59:47.083 --> 59:48.917
Nothing else
I could do.

59:49.002 --> 59:51.420
I just wish
you'd told me.

59:51.504 --> 59:54.381
And what would
that have changed?

59:58.094 --> 59:59.845
(coach)
Set.

59:59.929 --> 01:00:01.471
Go!
Bring it!

01:00:01.556 --> 01:00:03.599
Come on, baby!
Let's go!

01:00:03.683 --> 01:00:05.267
[click]

01:00:05.310 --> 01:00:07.603
I thought you were
a running back, Deon.

01:00:07.687 --> 01:00:10.022
That's who gets
all the pretty girls
and make all the money.

01:00:10.106 --> 01:00:12.274
Now give us some
running back time.
Get back down there.

01:00:12.358 --> 01:00:14.776
You got another
one in you?

01:00:14.819 --> 01:00:16.612
(Deon)
Alright.

01:00:16.696 --> 01:00:18.488
(coach)
Just stride out.
stride out.

01:00:18.573 --> 01:00:20.282
This kid's nuts.

01:00:20.325 --> 01:00:21.658
Yeah, he's the
best I've ever seen.

01:00:25.121 --> 01:00:27.331
You know, I can remember
the exact moment

01:00:27.415 --> 01:00:32.461
when I realized that I
wasn't gonna be playing
professional football.

01:00:32.545 --> 01:00:36.715
What are you
gonna do now?

01:00:36.799 --> 01:00:38.383
I don't know.

01:00:38.468 --> 01:00:41.219
Look, if you need a job,

01:00:41.304 --> 01:00:43.472
why don't you come
see me at the end
of the summer.

01:00:43.514 --> 01:00:46.141
I'll see if I can
get you on the staff.

01:00:46.184 --> 01:00:49.061
You'll work with
the running backs,

01:00:49.145 --> 01:00:50.729
keep you close
to the game.

01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:59.946
[sigh]

01:01:02.241 --> 01:01:05.077
Ray. That's the last
drink for you.

01:01:05.161 --> 01:01:06.703
Hey!

01:01:06.788 --> 01:01:09.498
And I called a taxi,
it's on the way.

01:01:09.582 --> 01:01:10.874
Bacardi coke?

01:01:10.958 --> 01:01:13.418
Yeah, make it
a double.

01:01:13.503 --> 01:01:15.504
You girls
talking about me?

01:01:15.546 --> 01:01:19.424
Yeah, about how much
of a red hot stud you are.

01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:20.842
[chuckles]

01:01:20.927 --> 01:01:23.095
So who's
taking me home?

01:01:23.179 --> 01:01:28.016
She is, baby.
I lost the
flip, sorry.

01:01:28.059 --> 01:01:30.977
Respect your elders, now.

01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:35.607
[crash]

01:01:35.692 --> 01:01:37.693
Oh, we gotta get him
out of here.

01:01:37.777 --> 01:01:40.112
We don't have that
kind of insurance.

01:01:40.196 --> 01:01:43.281
When'd you start
smoking again?

01:01:43.366 --> 01:01:48.704
Well, Eric left.

01:01:48.746 --> 01:01:51.415
My son's sick.
The bills are mounting up.

01:01:51.499 --> 01:01:53.250
[sigh]

01:01:53.334 --> 01:01:56.420
And everywhere I look,
I'm in the damn brick wall.

01:01:56.504 --> 01:02:02.050
You know what
I did, I put all
my dreams in one basket.

01:02:02.135 --> 01:02:04.553
Here I am back here
at square one.

01:02:04.595 --> 01:02:08.140
I thought my days
of spoon-feeding
infants was over.

01:02:08.224 --> 01:02:13.395
And I'm here with--what?

01:02:13.479 --> 01:02:16.064
Oh, shit.
Deon!

01:02:16.107 --> 01:02:18.567
Deon!
Wait, baby, wait!

01:02:18.651 --> 01:02:21.111
No!

01:02:21.195 --> 01:02:23.655
Stop, look,
I'm sorry.

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:28.243
I didn't mean it
like that.
I just--

01:02:28.286 --> 01:02:32.080
Oh!

01:02:32.123 --> 01:02:33.874
I'm sorry.

01:02:44.385 --> 01:02:46.178
Hey, man,
I'm looking for a job.

01:02:46.262 --> 01:02:48.013
You hiring?

01:02:48.097 --> 01:02:51.349
Hey, I'm looking for work.
You guys need any help?

01:03:23.132 --> 01:03:25.467
(Deon)
Hey, Kerry,
what's up?

01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:27.844
Hey, do I--do
I know you?

01:03:27.929 --> 01:03:31.056
Yeah, you--remember
we used to hang out.

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:35.560
I'm sorry,
I don't remember you.

01:03:52.286 --> 01:03:53.870
(June)
So how
did it go?

01:03:53.955 --> 01:03:57.040
It didn't. I quit
that bullshit ass job.

01:03:57.124 --> 01:03:59.042
Minimum wage, stand
on your feet all day

01:03:59.126 --> 01:04:00.919
cleaning up
after motherfuckers.

01:04:01.003 --> 01:04:03.672
Man, I don't know
how regular people
do that shit.

01:04:03.756 --> 01:04:05.423
To top it off, man,
this chick I used to hit,

01:04:05.508 --> 01:04:07.676
she didn't even
recognize me.

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:09.261
What?

01:04:09.345 --> 01:04:11.680
I don't need
that bullshit.

01:04:11.722 --> 01:04:13.682
Man, fuck them
bitches, man.

01:04:13.766 --> 01:04:15.934
They were only there
for you because
you was up.

01:04:16.018 --> 01:04:18.270
Now that shit
got kinda hard,
you know,

01:04:18.354 --> 01:04:19.938
bitches ain't nowhere
to be found, man.

01:04:20.022 --> 01:04:21.356
You don't need
that shit.

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:22.858
You still Deon.

01:04:22.942 --> 01:04:25.235
(Deon)
Hey, how you doin'?

01:04:25.319 --> 01:04:27.195
My name is Deon.

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:28.864
Maybe you can give
me your number,

01:04:28.948 --> 01:04:29.781
I'll call you,
we can hang
out sometime.

01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:31.575
Okay.

01:04:31.617 --> 01:04:33.410
See if we can
put something
together, right?

01:04:33.494 --> 01:04:36.037
Right.

01:04:36.122 --> 01:04:38.748
Karen.
Alright, I'll
holler at you.

01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:42.627
You're right.

01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:44.296
Shit.

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:45.630
Hey, you got a little
change I could borrow

01:04:45.715 --> 01:04:47.173
till I get back
on my feet?

01:04:47.258 --> 01:04:49.009
Man, I ain't got
nothing' right now,

01:04:49.093 --> 01:04:52.053
till I get paid
for that last
little party I did.

01:04:52.096 --> 01:04:54.055
Soon as I get the
money for that,

01:04:54.098 --> 01:04:55.473
man, I got you.

01:04:57.894 --> 01:04:58.977
Don't trip.

01:05:03.482 --> 01:05:05.483
Hey.
Hey, come in.

01:05:05.568 --> 01:05:09.321
I was in the neighborhood.
Thought I'd bring by
some food.

01:05:09.405 --> 01:05:10.822
Well, Deon's
not here right
now but I'm sure

01:05:10.907 --> 01:05:12.991
he'll appreciate
you stopping by.

01:05:13.075 --> 01:05:16.244
I hope so. We haven't
been talking much lately.

01:05:16.329 --> 01:05:17.245
Yeah?

01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:19.331
Have a seat.

01:05:19.415 --> 01:05:22.000
I'm sitting here
finishing up Doctor
RandalI's assignment.

01:05:22.084 --> 01:05:24.085
The Green Project?

01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:25.837
Let me see
what you got.

01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:27.923
Take a look.

01:05:28.007 --> 01:05:29.758
That's exactly
what I thought.

01:05:29.842 --> 01:05:30.926
Right? Solar power.

01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:32.135
Yeah, solar.

01:05:32.219 --> 01:05:33.511
Exactly.

01:05:33.596 --> 01:05:34.804
Especially in
the inner city.

01:05:34.889 --> 01:05:36.514
We get hit
the hardest

01:05:36.599 --> 01:05:39.351
with cellular towers,
pollution, everything.

01:05:39.435 --> 01:05:40.936
This would be beautiful.

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:42.938
Exactly. I just want
everybody to jump

01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:44.981
aboard with that,
you know?

01:05:45.066 --> 01:05:46.608
Yeah, I think
that's good.

01:05:46.692 --> 01:05:48.109
Thanks.

01:05:48.194 --> 01:05:50.779
Do you know
how you met?

01:05:50.821 --> 01:05:52.322
Huh? Excuse me?

01:05:52.406 --> 01:05:56.201
Deon. Do you know
how you guys met?

01:05:56.285 --> 01:05:57.202
At the bookstore.

01:05:57.286 --> 01:06:00.497
Through me.

01:06:00.581 --> 01:06:02.999
That day at
the bookstore,

01:06:03.084 --> 01:06:05.293
I was gonna come
ask you out.

01:06:05.336 --> 01:06:08.630
But before I could,
Deon blocked me and
got your number

01:06:08.673 --> 01:06:12.217
and then
handed it to me
outside the door.

01:06:12.301 --> 01:06:14.177
You're tripping.

01:06:14.261 --> 01:06:16.972
Why do think it was
me that called you
instead of him?

01:06:17.014 --> 01:06:18.723
He had a lot
going on.

01:06:18.808 --> 01:06:19.724
Oh, please.

01:06:19.809 --> 01:06:21.059
He was busy.

01:06:21.143 --> 01:06:23.186
Come on, Sharon.
Come on.

01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:29.150
Do you really think you
were anything special
to him back then?

01:06:29.235 --> 01:06:33.989
Why are you telling
me this now?

01:06:34.073 --> 01:06:37.158
You're a good
woman, Sharon.

01:06:37.243 --> 01:06:39.744
Yeah.
Thanks.

01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:47.252
I don't want to see you
become another one
of his fools.

01:06:47.336 --> 01:06:52.090
Hey. It was me that
was interested in you.

01:06:52.174 --> 01:06:54.926
Yeah.

01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:56.011
Shhh.
Me.

01:07:03.477 --> 01:07:06.271
[door opens
and closes]

01:07:06.355 --> 01:07:08.106
What the fuck?

01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:09.024
Deon.

01:07:09.108 --> 01:07:10.233
Get out!

01:07:10.317 --> 01:07:12.777
Deon. Let
me explain.

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:14.529
Just leave.

01:07:14.613 --> 01:07:16.239
- No, you ain't gotta
go nowhere.
- You, too.

01:07:16.323 --> 01:07:17.574
This is more my house
than it is yours, okay?

01:07:17.658 --> 01:07:19.534
You got it twisted.

01:07:19.577 --> 01:07:20.785
Twisted? You're the
one here trying to
fuck my girl.

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:21.786
It wasn't
even like that.

01:07:21.871 --> 01:07:22.871
No, tell her.

01:07:22.955 --> 01:07:24.873
Tell her what?

01:07:24.957 --> 01:07:26.583
How you don't give a shit
about anyone else
but yourself.

01:07:26.667 --> 01:07:28.043
You don't care
about women.

01:07:28.127 --> 01:07:29.544
You don't even
know how.

01:07:29.628 --> 01:07:31.629
You jealous?

01:07:31.714 --> 01:07:33.256
You always did want
to be me, didn't
you, Sean?

01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:37.427
What is that
supposed to mean?

01:07:37.511 --> 01:07:41.431
You probably cheated
on every woman like a
dozen times.

01:07:41.515 --> 01:07:43.308
You too?

01:07:43.392 --> 01:07:45.226
So I get sick and
you start this bullshit,

01:07:45.269 --> 01:07:46.978
and you start
talking this shit.

01:07:47.063 --> 01:07:50.148
I'm not covering
for you anymore.

01:07:50.232 --> 01:07:54.444
It was all true, huh.

01:07:54.528 --> 01:07:56.071
You said
you loved me.

01:07:56.113 --> 01:07:57.489
I do love you.

01:07:57.573 --> 01:08:00.075
Why do you keep
messing with all

01:08:00.159 --> 01:08:02.452
these other girls
on the side? Huh?

01:08:02.536 --> 01:08:04.621
Why you say that
like you know for sure
I'm doing that?

01:08:04.705 --> 01:08:06.664
Why can't you
just stop?

01:08:06.749 --> 01:08:08.083
You're making
this bigger
than it actually is.

01:08:08.167 --> 01:08:10.210
Bigger than
what it is?

01:08:10.294 --> 01:08:12.170
When I close
my eyes and I think
about my future,

01:08:12.254 --> 01:08:16.674
I see your face.

01:08:16.759 --> 01:08:19.260
[loud weeping]

01:08:19.345 --> 01:08:21.095
Do you have
anything to say?

01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:23.180
I'm not the one that
got some explaining
to do.

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:24.765
You were kissing
my fucking brother.

01:08:24.850 --> 01:08:27.602
And you the one
been lying.

01:08:27.685 --> 01:08:29.979
I don't want
any part of this.

01:08:30.064 --> 01:08:32.107

01:08:32.191 --> 01:08:33.108
Hey, Sharon.

01:08:33.192 --> 01:08:34.274
Let her go.

01:08:34.318 --> 01:08:35.359
Hey, Sharon.

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:38.279

01:08:38.322 --> 01:08:40.698
Hey, you happy, man?
She's gone.

01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:42.450
Fuck you, man.

01:08:42.493 --> 01:08:43.827
Fuck all of this.

01:08:43.911 --> 01:08:46.371
Now you listen.

01:08:46.455 --> 01:08:49.040
You've been living
off of us, man.

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:53.294
Alright? The family
is broke and divided
because of you.

01:08:53.379 --> 01:08:55.462
Mom has to work two,
sometimes three jobs

01:08:55.548 --> 01:08:57.215
to help support you.

01:08:57.299 --> 01:08:59.300
I got work study, man.

01:08:59.385 --> 01:09:01.678
I got to take out all
these loans for my
college education.

01:09:01.761 --> 01:09:06.015
You get a full scholarship
and you don't even go to
class half the time.

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:08.017
You think you're
so fucking smart.

01:09:08.102 --> 01:09:10.687
Nobody fucking
knows you, Sean.

01:09:10.770 --> 01:09:14.732
Everybody you know
knows you as
Deon's brother.

01:09:14.817 --> 01:09:16.234
Don't you forget that.

01:09:16.318 --> 01:09:17.234
You listen.

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:19.654
[panting]

01:09:19.738 --> 01:09:22.573
Now Eric ain't here
to back your ass up.

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:25.076
And Mom ain't
nowhere around.

01:09:25.161 --> 01:09:27.537
You need to step off.

01:09:27.621 --> 01:09:29.080
You always
was half a man.

01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:31.707
Get off!

01:09:31.792 --> 01:09:36.880
You think I
meant to get
sick? Huh?

01:09:36.964 --> 01:09:39.256
You think if I leave
all your problems
will go away?

01:09:39.341 --> 01:09:42.594
Then I'll leave then.

01:09:42.678 --> 01:09:44.761
Yeah. Yeah, right.

01:09:44.846 --> 01:09:47.599
As if you don't think
Mom's gonna come chasin'
after you!

01:09:47.683 --> 01:09:49.184
Fuck you.

01:09:49.268 --> 01:09:50.768
You can't stand on
your own two feet.

01:09:50.853 --> 01:09:52.270
You never have.

Hey, brother.

01:10:53.290 --> 01:10:57.627
I tell you you can't
sleep out here, man.

01:10:57.711 --> 01:10:59.504
Hey.

01:10:59.588 --> 01:11:04.259
Hey, partner.

01:11:04.301 --> 01:11:06.594

What the fuck

Can't find a job.

Got no degree
and I can't
stay at home.

01:11:15.688 --> 01:11:16.771
Come on
out of there.

01:11:27.324 --> 01:11:29.200
Okay, you can
stay here.

01:11:29.285 --> 01:11:32.120
You can stay
with me--till you
get your shit together.

Operative phrase,
you get your
shit together.

01:11:39.295 --> 01:11:40.878
Don't thank me.
You gonna work.

know cars.

Deon, baby,
where are you?

01:12:05.487 --> 01:12:07.447
I'm fine, Mom.

01:12:07.531 --> 01:12:09.198
Look, I'm gonna
be moving out for
a little while, alright?

01:12:09.283 --> 01:12:10.867
I need you
to respect this.

01:12:10.951 --> 01:12:12.827
What are you
talking about?

get your stuff,
let's go.

this on my own.

This is ridiculous,
you know that?

Go get your things,
I'm gonna take
you home,

and I'm gonna
go to work.

01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:57.413
Why you not
hearing me?

01:12:57.498 --> 01:12:59.165
I can't go

You can't do this.

Mom, it's alright.

01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:08.925
It's not good
for you right now.

01:13:09.009 --> 01:13:10.259
You shouldn't be
exposed to germs
like that.

Stop.

If I make mistakes
I gotta make 'em
on my own.

Okay. Whatever
I did, I'm sorry, okay?

01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:27.485
Mom, you didn't
do nothing.

01:13:27.569 --> 01:13:29.737
Listen, when your
daddy left,

01:13:29.822 --> 01:13:32.323
I was so busy trying
to be mother and father

01:13:32.408 --> 01:13:34.075
that I would go
and work too hard

01:13:34.159 --> 01:13:35.827
and I'd come home
feeling guilty

01:13:35.911 --> 01:13:37.912
and then I'd love
you all too hard,
you know?

01:13:37.955 --> 01:13:39.997
So maybe if you feel
like I smothered you or--

01:13:40.082 --> 01:13:41.791
abandoned you
or something
like that--

01:13:41.875 --> 01:13:43.292
You didn't smother us.
It's not you, Mom.

01:13:43.377 --> 01:13:46.754
This is too hard
for me right now.

01:13:46.797 --> 01:13:49.090
I need you
to come home
with me. Come home.

figure this out
for myself.

take care of you?

care of me.

You promise me.

01:14:12.030 --> 01:14:17.118
Yeah.

01:14:17.202 --> 01:14:19.954

I'm the one that
should be sorry, man.

I wanted to when I was

'cause you got a big-ass
chip on both shoulders."

I was messed up.

Maybe she's right.

01:17:50.916 --> 01:17:54.543
Maybe I was
too hard on
you, Deon.

01:17:54.628 --> 01:18:00.591
For trying--
for trying to
live through you.

01:18:00.676 --> 01:18:04.845
But whatever I did or
didn't do in my life,

01:18:04.930 --> 01:18:08.224
that's on me.

What about
my life?

01:18:10.894 --> 01:18:13.854
What do I do now?

01:18:13.939 --> 01:18:15.231
[sigh]

01:18:15.315 --> 01:18:16.440
Well, you know
our people.

01:18:16.525 --> 01:18:19.193
Black folks--

01:18:19.277 --> 01:18:21.612
most of us
we wanna play ball,

01:18:21.697 --> 01:18:24.407
and we never learn
to own the team.

01:18:24.491 --> 01:18:27.576
Look here.

01:18:27.661 --> 01:18:30.204
This is made
in China.

01:18:30.247 --> 01:18:31.706
Why is this
made in China?

01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:33.416
I don't know.

01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:34.625
'Cause the Chinese
man will work
very hard

01:18:34.710 --> 01:18:36.627
for very little money.

01:18:36.712 --> 01:18:39.964
So what you do is
you take the best
of each race, right?

01:18:40.048 --> 01:18:43.884
For example, work
like a Chinese man

01:18:43.969 --> 01:18:46.887
but get the education
of a rich white man.

01:18:46.930 --> 01:18:49.306
Learn to make
deals like a
Jewish man.

01:18:49.391 --> 01:18:53.227
And have the heart,
flavor and spirit
of a black man.

01:18:53.311 --> 01:18:55.312
You take that shit
and put it together,
it's done.

01:18:55.397 --> 01:18:57.898
Then you
just apply it to
being in the business

01:18:57.941 --> 01:19:00.067
of whatever you love.

01:19:00.152 --> 01:19:03.738
But that's
what I'm sayin'.

01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:08.284
Without football,
I don't know what I love.

01:19:08.368 --> 01:19:15.082
What the fuck else
can I do?

01:19:15.167 --> 01:19:18.335
Well, for me
after football,

01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:20.671
it was cars.

01:19:20.756 --> 01:19:22.673
Garage ain't much,
but at least I own it.

01:19:22.758 --> 01:19:24.300
I'm the boss.

01:19:24.384 --> 01:19:27.928
But look at you, Deon,
people like you.

01:19:28.013 --> 01:19:30.848
You got charisma.

01:19:30.932 --> 01:19:32.975
You make people
believe in you.

01:19:33.059 --> 01:19:34.935
You got people skills
like the way you sold
that man that car.

01:19:34.978 --> 01:19:36.854
I didn't do that.
You did that.

01:19:36.938 --> 01:19:39.523
You could sell shit, Deon.

01:19:39.608 --> 01:19:43.694
That's a legit skill.

01:19:43.779 --> 01:19:45.696
Well, I'm gonna
go see Coach.

01:19:45.781 --> 01:19:49.533
See if I can work
my way up into that
assistant position.

01:19:49.618 --> 01:19:51.118
If you're gonna
go see Coach,

01:19:51.161 --> 01:19:53.204
you can't go dressed
like that, man.

01:19:53.288 --> 01:19:54.997
You know what
my daddy always said?

01:19:55.081 --> 01:19:58.375
Dress for the job you want,
not the job you have.

01:19:58.460 --> 01:19:59.960
I got something for you.

01:20:00.003 --> 01:20:01.045
I got something.

01:20:01.129 --> 01:20:03.464
Hold on.
Uh-huh.

01:20:03.548 --> 01:20:05.466
You could fit this.
Look at this.

01:20:05.509 --> 01:20:08.219
Designer shit.
Stand up.

01:20:08.303 --> 01:20:12.306
I call it
Negro Make-Do.
Look here.

01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:13.808
Uh-huh.

01:20:13.850 --> 01:20:16.018
Yeah, look like
Negro need money.

01:20:16.102 --> 01:20:17.645
Come on, man,
it'll work.

01:20:17.729 --> 01:20:19.063
I'm taller than
you, man.

01:20:19.147 --> 01:20:20.981
Look, sagging is
in style.

01:20:21.066 --> 01:20:23.526
Just sag this shit
a little bit.

01:20:23.610 --> 01:20:26.737
Put your hands
in your pockets,
you know.

01:20:26.822 --> 01:20:28.280
It's gonna
look like I wore it.

01:20:44.172 --> 01:20:46.298
(coach)
Hey, hey, hey.

01:20:46.383 --> 01:20:48.926
Stop standing around.
Let's set it up
and run it again.

01:20:54.891 --> 01:20:56.517
Defense gonna
eat 'em up

01:20:56.601 --> 01:20:57.434
if they don't
fall deeper
into that pocket.

01:20:57.519 --> 01:20:59.019
[chuckle]

01:20:59.104 --> 01:21:01.856
Deon, what can
I do for
you, son?

01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:05.568
I just came to see
about that assistant position.

01:21:05.652 --> 01:21:08.863
Hey, Soris,
run it again
till they get it right.

01:21:08.905 --> 01:21:12.116
Alright, boys, let's go.
Let's run it again.

01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:15.703
I went to the administration,
I asked them about putting
you on the staff.

01:21:15.787 --> 01:21:18.414
And they said that
well, the budget cuts

01:21:18.498 --> 01:21:22.376
and a lot of mumbo jumbo
about people losing
their jobs.

01:21:22.419 --> 01:21:26.630
They're pretty much
afraid to say yes.

01:21:26.715 --> 01:21:29.550
So they're saying no?

01:21:29.593 --> 01:21:34.054
Deon, the real reason
I can't put you on
my staff

01:21:34.139 --> 01:21:37.725
is because the university
feels because of
your condition,

01:21:37.767 --> 01:21:39.810
that if something
happened to you

01:21:39.895 --> 01:21:42.146
and you're uninsured,

01:21:42.230 --> 01:21:47.568
they'd be
on the hook
for the costs.

01:21:47.611 --> 01:21:49.069
I'm so sorry, son.

01:21:57.412 --> 01:21:59.622
(male reporter)
ln other news,

01:21:59.706 --> 01:22:01.832
unemployment figures
are in and the numbers
are not good.

01:22:01.917 --> 01:22:04.418
Cheap labor continues
to be outsourced abroad.

01:22:04.461 --> 01:22:06.503
Particularly hardest hit
are minorities.

01:22:06.588 --> 01:22:10.257
Black unemployment
is almost twice
that of white.

01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:14.470
Unemployment amongst
blacks has risen 33%
over the past two years.

01:22:14.554 --> 01:22:15.971
Manufacturing and
construction jobs

01:22:16.056 --> 01:22:18.015
have been hit
the hardest.

01:22:18.099 --> 01:22:20.476
Unskilled workers and those
without college degrees

01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:24.271
are finding it
increasingly difficult to
land gainful employment.

01:22:24.356 --> 01:22:28.400
[baby crying]

01:23:00.058 --> 01:23:12.403
Okay, I will
transfer you.

01:23:12.487 --> 01:23:15.572
Mr. Barnes,
someone is
here to see you.

01:23:27.293 --> 01:23:30.754
Deon, you can't just
show up here like
this, man.

01:23:30.839 --> 01:23:32.506
I got no more
money to give you.

01:23:32.590 --> 01:23:34.174
I'm not asking for money.
I'm asking for a job.

01:23:34.259 --> 01:23:36.427
You don't got
any experience.

01:23:36.511 --> 01:23:38.095
Is this some kind
of joke to you, Deon?

01:23:38.179 --> 01:23:40.097
It's not a joke, man.
I just need a job.

01:23:40.181 --> 01:23:43.434
Just give me
a chance, please.

01:23:43.518 --> 01:23:45.602
Please, I can do this.

01:23:45.687 --> 01:23:47.730
Look, I'm a Finance
manager, not Sales.

01:23:47.814 --> 01:23:50.566
Even if I could,
I can't make that
kind of decision.

01:23:50.650 --> 01:23:53.402
Please, man.
Just try me out, man.

01:23:53.486 --> 01:23:55.029
There's gotta be
something I can do.

01:23:55.113 --> 01:23:56.363
I can't.

01:23:56.448 --> 01:23:57.197
I'll work
for free.

01:23:57.282 --> 01:23:58.699
Deon.

01:23:58.742 --> 01:24:00.367
Please, man.
Don't make me beg.

01:24:00.452 --> 01:24:05.706
Deon.

01:24:05.749 --> 01:24:07.750
I'm sorry, man.

01:24:07.834 --> 01:24:15.299
I'm sorry for everything
I said, for everything
I done.

01:24:15.383 --> 01:24:19.553
I apologize.
I don't know what
else to say to you.

01:24:22.098 --> 01:24:24.058
Sharon, I'm sorry.

01:24:24.142 --> 01:24:26.310
I didn't mean to say
the things I said
to you.

01:24:26.394 --> 01:24:28.645
I didn't mean it.

01:24:28.730 --> 01:24:33.317
I just need a little
bit of help, man.

01:24:33.401 --> 01:24:35.110
I didn't mean to say it.
I mean it.

01:24:35.195 --> 01:24:39.323
[voice breaking]
I just need some help.

01:24:39.407 --> 01:24:41.075
Come on,
get up.

01:24:41.117 --> 01:24:43.077
Come on,
get up,
get up.

01:24:43.119 --> 01:24:45.162
You're embarrassing yourself.

01:24:45.246 --> 01:24:47.247
Just--I'm sorry.

01:24:47.332 --> 01:24:50.125
I was just trying
to find a job.

01:25:32.043 --> 01:25:36.380
Hey, son.
You work here?

01:25:36.464 --> 01:25:38.173
Yeah.

01:25:38.258 --> 01:25:41.176
I want to talk to you
about this car right here.

01:25:41.261 --> 01:25:42.052
This car?

01:25:42.137 --> 01:25:43.720
Yeah.

01:25:43.805 --> 01:25:47.391
It's a Chrysler 2005.
lt's listed at 11,150

01:25:47.475 --> 01:25:49.977
but I could probably
get it for you
at ten five.

01:25:50.061 --> 01:25:52.354
- Sean.
- What?

01:25:57.527 --> 01:26:00.195
That's your brother
out there, huh?

01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:02.197
Is this gonna
be a problem?

01:26:02.282 --> 01:26:04.449
No. No, sir,
no problem.

01:26:06.619 --> 01:26:10.247
Well, if you can
do ten five, I don't
see why you can't do ten.

01:26:10.331 --> 01:26:12.499
I might be able to get
it for you for ten.

01:26:12.584 --> 01:26:14.001
Then you might
have a sale.

01:26:16.588 --> 01:26:21.091
Hold, one moment
please, one moment.

01:26:21.176 --> 01:26:22.593
Deon. Deon,
what the fuck.

01:26:22.677 --> 01:26:24.011
Please, I got this.

01:26:24.053 --> 01:26:25.429
What the fuck
are you doing?

01:26:25.513 --> 01:26:26.805
I'm up for
promotion here.

01:26:26.890 --> 01:26:28.056
I won't mess up,
I swear.

01:26:28.141 --> 01:26:29.349
You gonna get
me fired.

01:26:29.392 --> 01:26:33.103
I won't, please.

01:26:33.188 --> 01:26:34.563
Just let me do this.

01:26:38.067 --> 01:26:40.319
Fuck.
Fuck.

01:26:44.574 --> 01:26:46.783
Fucking manager,
he's pissed.

01:26:46.868 --> 01:26:48.702
I'm sorry, I can't
sell it to you for
that price.

01:26:48.786 --> 01:26:50.871
If I do, we're gonna
actually lose money.

01:26:50.914 --> 01:26:52.873
You told me I could
have it for that price.

01:26:52.916 --> 01:26:55.042
Either you're a man
of your word,

01:26:55.084 --> 01:26:56.627
or you're not.

01:26:56.711 --> 01:26:58.128
The owner's gonna be
here in 15 minutes.

01:26:58.213 --> 01:27:00.214
And if the paperwork's
isn't done,

01:27:00.298 --> 01:27:05.969
chances are he's gonna
shut down this deal
and me with it.

01:27:06.054 --> 01:27:07.804
Hey, hey, hey!

01:27:07.889 --> 01:27:09.765
Not so fast.

01:27:09.849 --> 01:27:12.267
You better get that
paperwork started
right now,

01:27:12.352 --> 01:27:14.645
'cause I'm writing
you a check,
end of story.

01:27:29.327 --> 01:27:32.079
It's a good try, man.

01:27:32.121 --> 01:27:34.665
He says it's good
for selling shit.

01:27:34.749 --> 01:27:37.501
Obviously, she sell you
some bullshit.

01:27:37.585 --> 01:27:40.170
Man, that's
a power tie.

01:27:40.255 --> 01:27:42.464
All the big
sellers wear
this shit.

01:27:42.548 --> 01:27:45.801
The tie
helps you
sell stuff.

01:27:45.885 --> 01:27:51.431
71,000 miles. It's actually
priced at 3500 dollars.

01:27:51.474 --> 01:27:54.768
Here we are, a beautiful
car for a beautiful lady.

01:27:58.982 --> 01:28:00.941
My brother runs
the finances.

01:28:01.025 --> 01:28:04.194
If you can get them
in that margin
right there,

01:28:04.279 --> 01:28:05.654
we in business, brother.

01:28:05.738 --> 01:28:06.947
You never know
if you don't try.

01:28:07.031 --> 01:28:08.115
That's right.

01:28:09.784 --> 01:28:12.369
See? Same suit
but you change the tie.

01:28:12.453 --> 01:28:14.079
You're ready.

01:28:14.163 --> 01:28:17.207
(Deon)
A 2009
Jeep Cherokee.

01:28:17.292 --> 01:28:19.293
Got enough space
for you to take
the dog.

01:28:19.335 --> 01:28:21.003
I know how much
you love the dog.
Hey, Noah.

01:28:21.087 --> 01:28:22.671
I'm gone for
a couple of days

01:28:22.755 --> 01:28:26.675
and new car
sales double.

01:28:26.759 --> 01:28:27.884
Hear that, Gerry?

01:28:27.969 --> 01:28:31.138
He beat your record.

01:28:33.975 --> 01:28:37.144
Good initiative
using your brother, Sean.

01:28:37.228 --> 01:28:39.187
Thank you, sir.

01:28:39.272 --> 01:28:42.190
Come on, let's talk
about moving you up
to General Manager.

01:28:52.035 --> 01:28:53.577
D, what up, baby?

01:28:53.661 --> 01:28:56.038
What up?

01:28:56.122 --> 01:28:58.665
Shit, what's this?

01:28:58.750 --> 01:29:00.751
I told you I was
gonna pay you back.

01:29:00.835 --> 01:29:03.086
I didn't believe it.

01:29:03.171 --> 01:29:04.671
I got something
else you ain't
gonna believe.

01:29:04.714 --> 01:29:06.381
Check it out.

01:29:06.466 --> 01:29:09.217
Ooh, damn.

01:29:09.302 --> 01:29:11.762
[indistinct]
I'm seeing eye candy.

01:29:11.846 --> 01:29:13.889
Yeah, but
this how brothers
be fucking up.

01:29:13.973 --> 01:29:16.725
They end up buying
some shit that's too
expensive on credit,

01:29:16.809 --> 01:29:18.310
and the banks win, man.

01:29:18.394 --> 01:29:19.644
As soon as the car
pulls off the lot,

01:29:19.729 --> 01:29:21.229
it's considered
a used car.

01:29:21.314 --> 01:29:22.272
Believe it or not,
this is a used car.

01:29:22.357 --> 01:29:23.565
What?

01:29:23.649 --> 01:29:24.566
Yeah.

01:29:24.650 --> 01:29:26.109
Does it run?

01:29:26.194 --> 01:29:27.486
It still got the
factory warranty.

01:29:27.570 --> 01:29:29.196
Eric says
it runs beautiful.

01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:30.530
And you know
that brother don't play.

01:29:30.615 --> 01:29:31.907
Man.

01:29:31.991 --> 01:29:34.242
What about
the gas though?

01:29:34.327 --> 01:29:35.869
Gas? It's a hybrid.

01:29:35.953 --> 01:29:37.454
You goin' green, nigga.

01:29:37.538 --> 01:29:38.955
You know I like
that green.

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:41.541
And it's American made.

01:29:41.626 --> 01:29:43.543
So you there ain't that shit
with the accelerator getting
stuck and all that shit.

01:29:43.628 --> 01:29:44.795
Can I afford it?

01:29:44.879 --> 01:29:46.296
No.

01:29:46.381 --> 01:29:47.464
Get a white bitch
to co-sign?

01:29:47.548 --> 01:29:49.466
You might.

01:29:49.550 --> 01:29:52.803
No, you can do like
Sean taught me,
and incorporate.

01:29:52.887 --> 01:29:55.222
Then you're not buying
as an individual,

01:29:55.306 --> 01:29:56.932
you're buying
as the actual company.

01:29:57.016 --> 01:29:58.392
You pay it off
through your taxes,

01:29:58.476 --> 01:30:00.102
you know, like
the big boys do.

01:30:00.186 --> 01:30:03.814
Damn, man, you
gettin' kinda
smart, nigga.

01:30:03.898 --> 01:30:05.649
Now you know it's
hurtin' my feelings

01:30:05.733 --> 01:30:07.901
to find that you just now
realizing that I'm smart.

01:30:07.944 --> 01:30:09.486
Smart as the
new gangsta.

01:30:09.570 --> 01:30:12.239
Man. Let's
go get the keys.

01:30:12.323 --> 01:30:19.246
That's 12 new,
2 used. You
did good, man.

01:30:19.288 --> 01:30:21.915
Hey, I got promoted
to GM because of you.

01:30:21.958 --> 01:30:23.125
What?

01:30:23.209 --> 01:30:24.626
Yeah. Me.

01:30:24.710 --> 01:30:26.920
Good.
That's real good.

01:30:26.963 --> 01:30:28.422
I got a favor
to ask you.

01:30:28.506 --> 01:30:30.132
What?

01:30:30.216 --> 01:30:32.551
We don't get paid
till the end of the month.

01:30:32.635 --> 01:30:34.511
So I was wondering
if you would pull
a drawer for me.

01:30:34.595 --> 01:30:36.263
That's a lot
of money, Deon.

01:30:36.347 --> 01:30:38.682
I know, but where
else am I gonna go,
Mr. GM?

01:30:38.766 --> 01:30:41.017
Alright. Hey, Sharon,

01:30:41.102 --> 01:30:43.270
could you
pull some cash
from the lock box?

01:30:51.070 --> 01:30:52.154
Thank you.

01:30:57.618 --> 01:30:59.035
Here. You take
this so you
can pay back

01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:01.329
some of the student
loans you got.

01:31:01.372 --> 01:31:05.459
I want to thank both of you
for letting me in here
and do my thing.

01:31:05.543 --> 01:31:06.668
Alright.

01:31:19.765 --> 01:31:20.765
Ooh!

01:31:20.850 --> 01:31:23.977
Ooh, look at you!

01:31:24.020 --> 01:31:25.896
Look at you.
You look so good.

01:31:25.980 --> 01:31:27.439
You gained weight.

01:31:27.523 --> 01:31:28.982
Yeah, I been
handling my business,

01:31:29.066 --> 01:31:32.360
trying to get
it together.

01:31:32.445 --> 01:31:33.862
You got a job?

01:31:33.946 --> 01:31:35.489
Sean gave
me a job.

01:31:35.573 --> 01:31:37.532
I'm selling cars
over at the dealership.

01:31:37.617 --> 01:31:40.160
Wait a minute,
you and your brother
are working together

01:31:40.203 --> 01:31:42.204
and nobody told
me about that?

01:31:42.288 --> 01:31:44.414
Yeah, Ma,
I thought that would
help with the bills.

01:31:44.499 --> 01:31:46.875
Look, I told you,
I don't want you
worrying about that.

01:31:46.959 --> 01:31:50.045
I know, but I'm tired
of watching you do
everything for everybody else

01:31:50.129 --> 01:31:51.755
but yourself.

01:31:51.839 --> 01:31:55.926
Ooh, you did it
to me again.

01:31:56.010 --> 01:31:59.054
Alright, I guess
you were right.

01:31:59.138 --> 01:32:01.681
You said you had
to do it yourself

01:32:01.766 --> 01:32:03.391
and you did,

01:32:03.476 --> 01:32:05.685
And thank God
I was able to
listen to you

01:32:05.728 --> 01:32:07.604
and just do it.

01:32:07.688 --> 01:32:09.189
But don't you be
giving up on your
mother, hear me?

01:32:09.273 --> 01:32:11.024
I'm not promising
anything but maybe

01:32:11.108 --> 01:32:13.109
I can go
back to college
and get that degree.

01:32:13.194 --> 01:32:15.028
[gasping]
Oh, man.

01:32:15.071 --> 01:32:17.239
Oh.

01:32:17.323 --> 01:32:19.533
Well, what the hell
are you looking so
sad for!

01:32:19.617 --> 01:32:21.034
Big D is back.

01:32:21.118 --> 01:32:22.953
Hey, Big D!

01:32:23.037 --> 01:32:24.538
[crowd cheers]

01:32:24.622 --> 01:32:26.540
Baby, are you hungry?

01:32:26.624 --> 01:32:29.209
Sherry, I want you to
get him some smothered
pork chops.

01:32:29.252 --> 01:32:30.794
Collard greens? With
collard greens, yeah.

01:32:30.878 --> 01:32:32.379
Collard greens,
corn bread.

01:32:32.463 --> 01:32:35.465
Okay! I'll do
it right now.

01:32:35.550 --> 01:32:36.883
And what you
want to drink?

01:32:36.968 --> 01:32:38.927
Cranberry juice
for you, right?

01:32:39.011 --> 01:32:41.805
Yeah.
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:32:41.889 --> 01:32:45.475
I'll get your refill.

01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:47.644
[groan]

01:32:47.728 --> 01:32:49.062
[sucks in air]

01:33:03.286 --> 01:33:06.746
Deon, I'm not
supposed to do this.

01:33:06.789 --> 01:33:08.832
I'm required to refer
you to the oncology team.

01:33:08.916 --> 01:33:10.584
Is your family
going to be here soon?

01:33:10.626 --> 01:33:12.836
It's just me
this time.

01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:14.421
Look, I started
to gain my weight back.

01:33:14.505 --> 01:33:15.755
I was feeling good--

01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:18.091
and my hand
just seized up.

01:33:18.134 --> 01:33:20.677
Look, you're the only
one who's been straight
with us, Doc.

01:33:20.761 --> 01:33:26.349
Just tell me the truth.

01:33:26.434 --> 01:33:29.769
New MRI tests show
that...

01:33:29.812 --> 01:33:31.521
the cancer's come back.

01:33:31.606 --> 01:33:34.316
[gasping]
Fuck.

01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:38.528
You got a metastatic
tumor in your brain
that's appeared.

01:33:38.613 --> 01:33:40.780
It's right above
the motor cortex,

01:33:40.823 --> 01:33:45.285
and that's what's
affecting your hands.

01:33:45.369 --> 01:33:49.956
I've 9,000 dollars
left to my name, Doc.

01:33:49.999 --> 01:33:52.250
Can't drag my family
through this again.

01:33:58.174 --> 01:34:00.383
Come on.
Come with me.

01:34:03.471 --> 01:34:05.305
Isn't it fuckin' ironic?

01:34:05.389 --> 01:34:07.807
I'm a cancer doctor
but I enjoy second
hand smoke.

01:34:07.892 --> 01:34:11.645
I quit a year ago but
I still like coming
out here.

01:34:11.687 --> 01:34:14.481
I figure as long as I'm
not lighting up, it
doesn't count.

01:34:14.523 --> 01:34:15.398
Fuck it.

01:34:17.485 --> 01:34:21.488
I don't understand, Doc.
I did all the treatments.

01:34:21.572 --> 01:34:23.823
What's causing it?

01:34:23.908 --> 01:34:25.492
I don't know.

01:34:25.576 --> 01:34:28.828
I mean, environments,
cigarettes, genetics,

01:34:28.913 --> 01:34:33.208
the sun. I mean, there's
hundreds and hundreds
of reasons.

01:34:33.292 --> 01:34:37.545
It's impossible
to pinpoint just
one, Deon.

01:34:37.630 --> 01:34:39.923
Understand?

01:34:40.007 --> 01:34:44.678
Look, when I was a resident,
there was a patient that
I'll never forget.

01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:47.013
She and her husband
saved for years

01:34:47.098 --> 01:34:49.349
'cause they
wanted to take
a trip to Africa

01:34:49.392 --> 01:34:52.352
to see the
silver back gorillas
in the Congo.

01:34:52.436 --> 01:34:54.771
We saw her tests.

01:34:54.855 --> 01:34:58.024
We knew that any
treatment that we
gave her

01:34:58.067 --> 01:35:01.361
would just be
postponing the inevitable.

01:35:01.445 --> 01:35:05.865
I mean, she was dying.
She was riddled with cancer.

01:35:05.950 --> 01:35:09.035
I wanted to tell her,
we all wanted to tell her,

01:35:09.078 --> 01:35:12.205
but the hospitaI's policy
was pursue a very aggressive

01:35:12.289 --> 01:35:14.290
and expensive
series of treatments

01:35:14.375 --> 01:35:18.211
regardless of the fact
that her insurance
dropped her.

01:35:18.295 --> 01:35:20.964
Her husband lost everything.

01:35:21.048 --> 01:35:23.425
Their house, the savings,

01:35:23.509 --> 01:35:26.594
he never got to take
that trip with his wife.

01:35:26.679 --> 01:35:29.431
She died
a few months later.

01:35:29.515 --> 01:35:33.643
Right there.
ln this hospital.

01:35:33.728 --> 01:35:36.813
Look, you came to me because
I've been straight
with you, right?

01:35:36.897 --> 01:35:37.897
Yeah.

01:35:37.982 --> 01:35:40.650
Okay. Here it is.

01:35:40.735 --> 01:35:45.155
The 9,000 dollars
is not gonna go very far.

01:35:45.239 --> 01:35:47.991
This costs upwards
to 100,000 dollars,

01:35:48.075 --> 01:35:50.160
and even that's only
gonna buy you a few months,

01:35:50.244 --> 01:35:52.912
four months,
five months.

01:35:52.955 --> 01:35:55.832
And I die anyway?

01:35:55.916 --> 01:35:57.834
I'm telling you--

01:35:57.918 --> 01:36:00.920
I'm telling you
what the tests are
telling me, alright?

01:36:00.963 --> 01:36:03.047
There's always hope.

01:36:03.132 --> 01:36:06.634
But you can never
run again. There's no
athletics, that's over.

01:36:06.719 --> 01:36:09.596
Look, the question is--

01:36:09.638 --> 01:36:11.973
do you wanna do it
in there--

01:36:12.057 --> 01:36:14.601
with those machines
attached to you?

01:36:14.685 --> 01:36:17.937
Or do you want to
do it on your
own terms?

01:36:18.022 --> 01:36:19.898
That's the question.

01:36:35.873 --> 01:36:38.792
(female voice)
Honey--

01:36:38.876 --> 01:36:40.668
I know it's raining
right now,

01:36:40.753 --> 01:36:43.338
but you're gonna
have many more
birthdays, okay?

01:36:43.422 --> 01:36:46.466
Be happy and
celebrate today.

01:36:46.509 --> 01:36:49.260
Alright? Will
you do that
for me?

01:37:16.038 --> 01:37:18.540
Deon, you better wipe
the shower down
when you use it.

01:37:35.683 --> 01:37:37.350
[sigh]

01:37:37.393 --> 01:37:39.644
[inaudible]

01:37:42.982 --> 01:37:46.442
Congratulations, Momma.
You movin' on up.

01:37:46.527 --> 01:37:48.611
Like the
Jeffersons, baby.

01:37:48.696 --> 01:37:50.405
What you talkin' about?

01:37:50.489 --> 01:37:51.614
We got this big order
for Saturday night.

01:37:51.699 --> 01:37:52.907
Top of the line.

01:37:52.992 --> 01:37:56.119
[unintelligible].

01:37:56.203 --> 01:37:58.496
"Sean Barnes has
been accepted

01:37:58.581 --> 01:38:02.125
"into the Masters
of Business
Administration Program

01:38:02.209 --> 01:38:06.629
at Columbia University."

01:38:06.714 --> 01:38:09.632
You knew
about this?

01:38:09.717 --> 01:38:11.384
They offered
me a scholarship.

01:38:11.468 --> 01:38:15.555
Oh, baby.
We've been
going through all this

01:38:15.598 --> 01:38:18.308
and you've been
helping me and you
had time to apply?

01:38:18.392 --> 01:38:23.897
Oh, baby.
I'm so proud of you.

01:38:23.939 --> 01:38:27.317
And you know what?
I know I haven't
said that enough.

01:38:27.401 --> 01:38:29.110
And I haven't
said thank you enough.

01:38:29.194 --> 01:38:31.154
You've been helping
me so much.

01:38:31.238 --> 01:38:33.740
What?
Ooh.

01:38:33.782 --> 01:38:35.074
Check it out.
Check it out.

01:38:35.159 --> 01:38:35.909
What?

01:38:35.993 --> 01:38:37.410
Huh?

01:38:37.494 --> 01:38:38.620
Oh, that's beautiful.

01:38:38.704 --> 01:38:39.996
Oh my goodness.

01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:41.164
It's what
you're wearing.

01:38:41.248 --> 01:38:42.582
Who the hell are we

01:38:42.625 --> 01:38:45.084
catering for,
Michelle Obama?

01:38:45.127 --> 01:38:47.253
This is beautiful.
Who set this up?

01:38:47.296 --> 01:38:49.589
Somebody must
have recommended you.

01:39:00.225 --> 01:39:04.395
Okay.

01:39:11.570 --> 01:39:17.659
Can I help
you with those?

01:39:17.743 --> 01:39:19.619
You look
so handsome.

01:39:19.703 --> 01:39:22.163
You look beautiful.

01:39:22.247 --> 01:39:24.666
Really though.

01:39:24.750 --> 01:39:28.044
I mean--

01:39:28.128 --> 01:39:31.005
Well, it's
a party, Momma.

01:39:31.090 --> 01:39:33.508
[gasping]

01:39:33.592 --> 01:39:37.220
This is beautiful.

01:39:37.304 --> 01:39:39.472
You didn't tell me
it would be like this.

01:39:39.515 --> 01:39:41.307
Holy--

01:39:41.350 --> 01:39:44.560
This is great.

01:39:44.645 --> 01:39:48.648
I'm telling you.

01:39:48.691 --> 01:39:51.734
Bizzy Bee Catering
is a big star
right now.

01:39:51.819 --> 01:39:53.736
But you know,
I'm so excited.

01:39:53.821 --> 01:39:56.489
I went and looked
in my recipe book,

01:39:56.573 --> 01:39:58.866
my gourmet book
and I found--

01:39:58.951 --> 01:40:00.576
[upbeat music]

01:40:00.661 --> 01:40:02.537
(June)
Hey, Mrs. Barnes,

01:40:02.621 --> 01:40:03.997
you brought me some more
of that delicious food.

01:40:04.081 --> 01:40:05.498
What's up, Sean?

01:40:05.541 --> 01:40:06.874
Did you set
this up?

01:40:06.959 --> 01:40:08.209
You like?

01:40:08.293 --> 01:40:09.836
I love it.
It's beautiful.

01:40:09.878 --> 01:40:12.005
I had to grow up
one day, Mrs. B.

01:40:12.089 --> 01:40:14.674
Plus you know
I've always been
an entrepreneur type.

01:40:14.717 --> 01:40:16.884
How else was I gonna
pay for my weed?

01:40:16.969 --> 01:40:18.928
You are--

01:40:19.013 --> 01:40:20.888
Have a good
time tonight, man.

01:40:20.973 --> 01:40:22.348
Let's do this, y'all.

01:40:22.433 --> 01:40:23.850
It's beautiful.

01:40:23.892 --> 01:40:27.687
Ooh. What is this?

01:40:27.730 --> 01:40:30.106
Momma, I think
the guest of honor

01:40:30.190 --> 01:40:34.193
would like
to dance
with you.

01:40:39.158 --> 01:40:44.120
Look at my
two young men.

01:40:44.204 --> 01:40:47.540
What is this?

01:40:47.583 --> 01:40:50.209
Yeah, alright.

01:40:50.294 --> 01:40:52.420
They're playing
your song, Momma.

01:40:52.504 --> 01:40:54.589
(emcee)
This is a very special
request coming up,

01:40:54.673 --> 01:40:57.800
right here for
a very important
lady out here.

01:40:57.885 --> 01:41:01.304
And it's a special request
from our own host, Deon.

01:41:01.388 --> 01:41:03.264
Let's get it down.

01:41:03.348 --> 01:41:04.974
[soft music]

01:41:05.059 --> 01:41:10.229
I don't believe
you all.

01:41:10.272 --> 01:41:12.315
Here we go.

01:41:12.399 --> 01:41:14.901
I need you to
do me a favor.

01:41:14.985 --> 01:41:17.779
What is this about?

01:41:17.863 --> 01:41:19.906
I need you
to promise first.

01:41:19.948 --> 01:41:22.325
What is this?
Come on.

01:41:22.409 --> 01:41:24.118
I know you up
to something.

01:41:24.203 --> 01:41:25.912
Somebody wants
to dance with you.

01:41:33.796 --> 01:41:35.254
Go ahead,
go ahead.

01:41:35.339 --> 01:41:36.672
You--

01:41:36.757 --> 01:41:39.467
Come on now.

01:41:49.728 --> 01:41:51.187
It looks beautiful.

01:41:51.271 --> 01:41:52.438
Yeah.

01:41:52.523 --> 01:41:54.273
Thank you for this.

01:41:54.316 --> 01:41:58.027
Thank you, man,
I couldn't do
it without you.

01:41:58.112 --> 01:42:02.782
Yeah, they're men now.
Look at them.

01:42:02.825 --> 01:42:04.867
They're some good men.

01:42:04.952 --> 01:42:07.203
You remember
this place?

01:42:07.287 --> 01:42:10.832
Yeah, we used
to play pee wee
league here together.

01:42:10.916 --> 01:42:12.625
We had good times, man.

01:42:12.668 --> 01:42:14.168
Yeah.

01:42:14.253 --> 01:42:15.336
That's where all
the bullshit started.

01:42:15.420 --> 01:42:17.380
Where it all started.

01:42:17.464 --> 01:42:19.882
Hey, man, I have something
I shoulda done a long
time ago.

01:42:19.967 --> 01:42:21.092
Just wait a minute.

01:42:21.176 --> 01:42:28.141
[lively chatter]

01:42:28.183 --> 01:42:29.725
Sherry, can I borrow
Sharon for a minute?

01:42:29.810 --> 01:42:31.060
Yeah.

01:42:34.314 --> 01:42:40.570
What's going on?

01:42:40.654 --> 01:42:42.488
You two look
great together.

01:42:42.573 --> 01:42:45.366
I wanna see
you dance.

01:42:45.450 --> 01:42:47.702
You hesitate, this
is gonna start all
over again.

01:42:47.786 --> 01:42:49.829
Get out of
here, man.

01:42:55.878 --> 01:42:57.753
I can't dance.

01:42:57.838 --> 01:42:58.838
It's okay.

01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:06.345
Beautiful party.

01:43:06.430 --> 01:43:07.847
And beautiful lady.

01:43:19.526 --> 01:43:21.777
Oh, can you
believe this shit?

01:43:21.862 --> 01:43:24.280
I couldn't find a tux
in my size so I had to
settle for a size smaller.

01:43:24.364 --> 01:43:27.366
I started out
as a young man
playing quarterback

01:43:27.409 --> 01:43:29.410
and I got old
and became a lineman.

01:43:29.494 --> 01:43:32.079
Well, you busting
out of that, coach.

01:43:32.164 --> 01:43:34.081
It makes me look
slim, don't it?

01:43:34.166 --> 01:43:35.875
I'm glad you came.

01:43:35.918 --> 01:43:37.793
Well, it means a lot
that you called me.

01:43:37.878 --> 01:43:40.880
A lesser man would've
held a grudge about
what went on.

01:43:40.923 --> 01:43:42.715
Life's too short
for that kind
of shit.

01:43:42.758 --> 01:43:44.592
Sure is.

01:43:44.676 --> 01:43:46.928
We had some good times
together, didn't
we, Coach?

01:43:47.012 --> 01:43:49.722
Yes, we did.

01:43:49.806 --> 01:43:53.267
Hey, I want you
to--hold onto
this for me.

01:43:53.352 --> 01:43:57.480
I know you know
where I got it from.

01:43:57.564 --> 01:44:02.235
I know.
Thank you.

01:44:02.319 --> 01:44:04.654
It's a party, man.
Get your groove on.

01:44:04.738 --> 01:44:05.988
Yeah, okay.

01:44:16.667 --> 01:44:17.750
Come here.

01:44:17.793 --> 01:44:19.460
Yeah?

01:44:19.544 --> 01:44:20.962
I thought he was sick.
What's he celebrating?

01:44:21.046 --> 01:44:23.673
I don't know.

01:44:23.757 --> 01:44:25.841
I think he just
wanna go out
on top.

01:45:43.170 --> 01:45:44.587
Go! Go!

01:45:50.677 --> 01:45:52.303
That's it.

01:46:04.024 --> 01:46:05.191
[crowd cheering]

01:46:05.275 --> 01:46:07.068
That's my boy!

01:46:07.152 --> 01:46:08.652
[cheering]

01:46:15.702 --> 01:46:20.247
[wild cheering]

01:46:25.337 --> 01:46:27.713
[piano music]
