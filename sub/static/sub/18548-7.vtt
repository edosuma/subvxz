01:52.580 --> 01:55.259
I do hope I get to see her workshop.

01:55.260 --> 01:58.140
Anyone would think you're about
to have an audience with the Pope.

01:58.180 --> 01:59.219
Champagne?

01:59.220 --> 02:01.180
Well, I'll admit
to being a little...

02:01.220 --> 02:02.820
Giddy? Enthused. Hm!

02:04.660 --> 02:06.060
What are you doing here?

02:06.100 --> 02:07.579
Nobody's died, have they?

02:07.580 --> 02:10.340
This is an official
constabulary event, Father.

02:10.380 --> 02:11.779
I doubt you'll get in without a...

02:11.780 --> 02:14.020
Signed by Agnes Lesser. Ah!

02:14.060 --> 02:15.099
Who?

02:15.100 --> 02:17.059
The woman you're here to honour.

02:17.060 --> 02:19.260
To be honest, I'm just here
for the food and booze.

02:19.300 --> 02:21.060
And why does that not surprise me?

02:22.860 --> 02:24.499
Chief Inspector.

02:24.500 --> 02:26.380
Still a disgrace to the service.

02:27.620 --> 02:31.059
At least you can't do much harm,
out here in the sticks.

02:31.060 --> 02:34.979
Oh, I'll be forever
grateful for the transfer, sir.

02:34.980 --> 02:36.500
You do know it's a formal event?

02:37.700 --> 02:39.780
I've seen vagabonds look more sharp.

02:40.940 --> 02:42.460
Sergeant. Sir.

02:44.060 --> 02:46.060
My old boss from Durham.

02:46.100 --> 02:47.700
He's a complete...
CORK POPS

02:49.180 --> 02:50.180
Pardon my French.

02:52.220 --> 02:55.020
I still don't understand
what all this fuss is about.

02:55.060 --> 02:56.260
What do you mean?

02:56.300 --> 03:00.900
That woman getting a commendation
from the constabulary. And for what?

03:00.940 --> 03:02.540
For building doll's houses?

03:03.700 --> 03:06.380
How is that supposed to help
the police catch criminals?

03:36.500 --> 03:37.660
Holy Mother of God!

03:37.700 --> 03:38.900
They're amazing!

03:40.340 --> 03:44.020
Doll's houses are supposed
to be, well, lovely little pictures

03:44.060 --> 03:45.819
of domestic bliss.

03:45.820 --> 03:48.060
Not these bloodbaths.

03:48.100 --> 03:52.100
What kind of a sick mind could come
up with something like this, hmm?

03:52.140 --> 03:53.340
My daughter's.

03:55.180 --> 03:57.980
Oh, well, of course,
they are, er, well put together.

03:58.020 --> 04:00.820
Don't worry,
most civilians react the same way -

04:00.860 --> 04:02.699
my wife included.

04:02.700 --> 04:05.500
But, I can personally attest that,
as a teaching tool in the art of

04:05.540 --> 04:07.540
crime detection, they're remarkable.

04:07.580 --> 04:09.539
Still, darling, don't you worry?

04:09.540 --> 04:11.019
Why?

04:11.020 --> 04:12.620
Hardly a normal hobby, is it?

04:14.260 --> 04:15.420
I think they're beautiful.

04:17.540 --> 04:18.540
And so sad.

04:19.740 --> 04:22.019
Each tableaux,
a story of human suffering...

04:23.100 --> 04:24.180
..in such detail!

04:25.220 --> 04:26.620
Ah! The guest of honour.

04:30.220 --> 04:31.940
Thank you very much.

04:31.980 --> 04:35.380
I'm not going to make
any long-winded speeches

04:35.420 --> 04:38.100
and I don't expect
any of you to, either.

04:38.140 --> 04:39.180
I mean it.

04:40.460 --> 04:42.500
But, I do appreciate
my father awarding me...

04:42.540 --> 04:44.739
Not me, my dear. The constabulary.

04:44.740 --> 04:48.380
I assure everyone, there's not
a whiff of nepotism about this.

04:48.420 --> 04:51.620
..the constabulary
awarding me with a...

04:51.660 --> 04:53.379
Sorry, what was it called again?

04:53.380 --> 04:56.099
A Chief Constable
Certification of Commendation.

04:56.100 --> 04:57.860
Oh, you have one of those!

05:03.220 --> 05:08.460
A true honour and one that I share
wholeheartedly with my carpenter,

05:08.500 --> 05:11.940
Daniel Abeson, without whose
expert craftsmanship none of

05:11.980 --> 05:13.540
my dioramas would be possible.

05:17.220 --> 05:18.220
Thank you.

05:19.860 --> 05:22.780
Now don't stand on ceremony.
Please enjoy yourselves

05:22.820 --> 05:24.100
and thank you again. Hear, hear!

05:27.500 --> 05:29.060
Father Brown, thank you for coming.

05:30.140 --> 05:31.580
Oh...

05:31.620 --> 05:34.020
No, on the contrary,
I was honoured and, erm...

05:35.180 --> 05:37.939
..slightly bewildered
at your invitation.

05:37.940 --> 05:39.540
May I speak to you for a moment?

05:39.580 --> 05:40.700
Of course.

05:45.660 --> 05:48.700
We should probably get
one thing out of the way first.

05:48.740 --> 05:50.300
What's that? I'm an atheist.

05:51.540 --> 05:53.980
Well, I won't hold that against you.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.020
Thank you.

05:57.860 --> 06:02.580
Erm, so you haven't invited me here
for religious instruction.

06:02.620 --> 06:05.859
I suppose you know you have
something of a reputation.

06:05.860 --> 06:07.180
For good works, I hope.

06:08.900 --> 06:10.740
Well, I'd say
catching murderers is good works.

06:11.900 --> 06:15.180
Well, I prefer
to think of it as saving souls.

06:17.020 --> 06:19.340
And the thrill of the chase?

06:20.860 --> 06:22.580
The intellectual challenge?

06:22.620 --> 06:24.460
The exhilaration
of connecting the clues?

06:27.340 --> 06:30.499
Agnes,

06:30.500 --> 06:33.380
have you invited me here
to help you solve a murder?

06:36.060 --> 06:37.220
I want to show you something.

06:46.140 --> 06:49.059
Oh, I'm so sorry darling.

06:49.060 --> 06:51.220
Margaret, can you do
your job properly, please?

06:51.260 --> 06:54.100
Bring up some extra crates
of Champagne from the pantry.

06:54.140 --> 06:55.140
Yes, ma'am.

06:56.780 --> 06:57.780
Quite the little madam!

06:58.980 --> 07:00.659
What?

07:00.660 --> 07:04.260
I heard that she used to pose
for a certain type of magazine.

07:06.260 --> 07:08.340
You know what they say
about idle tongues, don't you?

07:09.460 --> 07:11.540
That they ought to be cut off.

07:11.580 --> 07:13.316
I don't believe
they say anything of the sort.

07:13.340 --> 07:14.620
It's what I say.

07:26.740 --> 07:29.659
It's like looking behind
the magician's curtain.

07:29.660 --> 07:31.580
If the magician's
a grisly-minded ghoul.

07:32.940 --> 07:34.340
Is that how you see yourself?

07:34.380 --> 07:35.740
No, but...

07:35.780 --> 07:36.740
But what?

07:36.780 --> 07:39.820
Well, death's always had
its shadow over this family.

07:42.060 --> 07:44.380
My little sister, Violet.

07:44.420 --> 07:46.460
She drowned a year after
this photograph was taken.

07:47.780 --> 07:50.340
And then my mother, ten
years ago. fell down the stairs.

07:51.740 --> 07:54.100
It wasn't long after that
I started working on the dioramas.

07:55.300 --> 07:57.300
A kind of therapy, I suppose.

07:58.700 --> 07:59.700
Speaking for the dead.

08:00.740 --> 08:02.340
Giving the victims a voice.

08:06.260 --> 08:07.860
MUSIC BOX STARTS PLAYING

08:10.300 --> 08:11.300
Belonged to my mother.

08:12.540 --> 08:15.260
She used to let me
and Violet play with it.

08:15.300 --> 08:17.980
It sounds like
it needs a spot of oil.

08:18.020 --> 08:20.459
I've gotten used to
its little creaks and cranks.

08:20.460 --> 08:23.499
It's almost like they've
become part of its personality.

08:23.500 --> 08:24.900
Is that what you wanted to show me?

08:25.940 --> 08:26.940
No.

08:40.140 --> 08:41.179
"The Woman On The Stairs".

08:42.780 --> 08:43.980
My mother.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.060
So, this is
where you've all been hiding.

08:51.780 --> 08:52.780
My God.

08:54.020 --> 08:55.059
What have you done?

08:55.060 --> 08:56.980
I want to know what really happened.

08:57.020 --> 08:58.220
You know what happened.

08:58.260 --> 08:59.380
It was an accident.

08:59.420 --> 09:01.739
Well, we'll soon find out
what a roomful of professionals

09:01.740 --> 09:02.899
have to say, won't we?

09:02.900 --> 09:04.516
This is a disgrace
to your mother's memory.

09:04.540 --> 09:07.180
I'm not disgracing her.
I'm honouring her.

09:07.220 --> 09:08.380
Did you know about this?

09:08.420 --> 09:10.380
She had no help from me.

09:10.420 --> 09:11.620
This is all her own work.

09:11.660 --> 09:14.820
Agnes, I assure you, I thoroughly
investigated your mother's

09:14.860 --> 09:16.500
tragic death
at the time of the incident.

09:16.540 --> 09:18.140
Maybe you made a mistake, sir.

09:19.380 --> 09:20.380
What did you say?

09:20.420 --> 09:22.380
Maybe you've had
a bit too much to drink, sir.

09:22.420 --> 09:24.980
I said maybe you made a mistake.

09:26.460 --> 09:29.499
Gentlemen, please.

09:29.500 --> 09:31.540
Let's listen
to what Agnes has to say.

09:32.700 --> 09:36.259
Victim, Florence Lesser, 48.

09:36.260 --> 09:37.780
Witness, Wilbur Lesser, husband.

09:39.180 --> 09:42.180
Mr Lesser reported that at 1.20AM,

09:42.220 --> 09:45.099
his wife rose from bed
to fetch a glass of water

09:45.100 --> 09:47.340
and tripped down the stairs,

09:47.380 --> 09:48.819
cutting her head on the banister,

09:48.820 --> 09:51.660
simultaneously cracking
her skull and breaking her neck.

09:52.860 --> 09:54.460
This is sick.

09:54.500 --> 09:56.100
So, please, your observations?

10:00.180 --> 10:01.180
Er...

10:07.540 --> 10:09.300
What are these lines?

10:09.340 --> 10:11.819
Height lines. Me and my sister.

10:11.820 --> 10:14.180
Our mother used to draw them
in every year, until...

10:16.580 --> 10:17.580
..she didn't.

10:25.580 --> 10:28.220
Well, don't just
stand there like lemmings.

10:28.260 --> 10:29.620
Look at the diorama.

10:29.660 --> 10:31.220
Study it. Tell me what you see.

10:34.820 --> 10:39.860
Well, if you don't think
she fell, then what?

10:39.900 --> 10:41.180
She was pushed.

10:41.220 --> 10:42.220
Exactly.

10:42.260 --> 10:44.060
Look at the blood spatter.

10:44.100 --> 10:46.900
It suggests force, speed.
A fall wouldn't do that.

10:46.940 --> 10:48.339
And who pushed her? Me?

10:48.340 --> 10:49.340
You had reason.

10:50.820 --> 10:53.460
Nothing happened between me and
Wilbur until after your mother...

10:53.500 --> 10:54.620
Oh, please!

10:54.660 --> 10:57.260
I'd like to ask our guests
to kindly return to the buffet.

10:57.300 --> 10:59.379
Not until they've had
a chance to fully study...

10:59.380 --> 11:00.500
Enough!

11:00.540 --> 11:02.379
You're deluded and obsessed.

11:02.380 --> 11:03.940
Stop this!

11:03.980 --> 11:04.980
Please!

11:12.420 --> 11:13.980
What's the matter? Nothing.

11:16.140 --> 11:17.540
Only you seem...

11:17.580 --> 11:19.380
I'm quite fine, Father.

11:21.660 --> 11:22.660
Thank you.

11:47.220 --> 11:48.140
Oh, Agnes.

11:48.141 --> 11:49.540
What do you think?

11:49.580 --> 11:51.300
Am I deluded?

11:51.340 --> 11:53.820
So blinded by grief
that I can't face the truth?

11:55.500 --> 11:58.180
My mother's death was nothing
more than a stupid accident.

11:59.700 --> 12:00.820
An almost trivial thing.

12:01.860 --> 12:03.020
No drama or intrigue.

12:04.500 --> 12:06.700
Worst of all, no-one to blame.

12:06.740 --> 12:10.780
I think you should
talk to Chief Inspector Webb.

12:10.820 --> 12:12.819
But I've tried countless times.

12:12.820 --> 12:13.820
Try again.

12:15.380 --> 12:18.019
I think he's seen
something in your diorama.

12:18.020 --> 12:19.260
WOMAN SCREAMS

12:35.700 --> 12:37.619
I want to be kept abreast
of all of your findings.

12:37.620 --> 12:39.499
I'll need statements
from all the guests.

12:39.500 --> 12:41.220
You can't take charge
of this investigation.

12:41.260 --> 12:42.940
You're a witness.

12:42.980 --> 12:44.100
And a suspect.

12:44.140 --> 12:46.260
With all due respect, sir,
she's right.

12:46.300 --> 12:48.779
We'll have to call
someone in from Scotland Yard.

12:48.780 --> 12:51.620
Given your antagonism towards the
victim just before he was killed,

12:51.660 --> 12:54.059
I'm not surprised you'd
rather delay the investigation.

12:54.060 --> 12:56.300
I hated the bloke,
but I didn't want him dead.

12:57.420 --> 12:59.140
That's a carpenter's awl.

13:01.020 --> 13:03.539
I left it here this morning,
when I was making alterations

13:03.540 --> 13:04.939
to the dioramas.

13:04.940 --> 13:06.420
Anyone could've picked it up.

13:06.460 --> 13:07.660
What's that in his hand?

13:15.140 --> 13:16.140
I can barely make it out.

13:20.340 --> 13:22.860
"Starbright Washing Powder".

13:22.900 --> 13:25.100
I use that detergent.

13:25.140 --> 13:27.419
Don't worry, I don't
think that makes you a suspect.

13:27.420 --> 13:28.780
It's from the newspaper.

13:28.820 --> 13:31.780
The fragment from the miniature
newspaper from the diorama.

13:32.860 --> 13:33.860
He must've taken it.

13:34.820 --> 13:35.980
I'll go and check, sir.

13:39.500 --> 13:40.899
What was in this paper?

13:40.900 --> 13:43.019
It was a mock-up
of the Kembleford Gazette,

13:43.020 --> 13:45.620
the one my mother
was reading the night she died.

13:45.660 --> 13:47.819
I had the printing press
reproduce the exact copy

13:47.820 --> 13:49.260
on the front and back pages.

13:49.300 --> 13:51.139
Detail is everything.

13:51.140 --> 13:52.220
Always.

13:52.260 --> 13:53.260
No.

13:54.300 --> 13:55.300
It's gone.

13:56.340 --> 13:57.380
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

13:58.780 --> 14:02.300
I think that we can deduce
that the chief inspector

14:02.340 --> 14:04.700
was gripping the paper when he died.

14:04.740 --> 14:08.139
Which strongly suggests
his murder is somehow connected

14:08.140 --> 14:10.620
to your wife's death,
and therefore nothing to do with me.

14:13.460 --> 14:14.660
That's a blood stain.

14:16.540 --> 14:17.740
Whose coat is this?

14:21.420 --> 14:22.420
This is a set-up!

14:24.260 --> 14:25.260
I'm so sorry, sir.

14:29.340 --> 14:32.540
I take it you don't think for an
instant that Inspector Mallory is...

14:32.580 --> 14:33.699
Of course not.

14:33.700 --> 14:35.036
Then the next thing we need to do...

14:35.060 --> 14:37.860
..is find the original newspaper
that the miniature was based upon.

14:39.060 --> 14:40.500
Do you still have it? Yes, sir.

14:44.580 --> 14:46.379
Well, you're going to need my help.

14:46.380 --> 14:48.499
We don't mind doing
a bit of snooping around.

14:48.500 --> 14:50.579
Oh, erm, don't worry.

14:50.580 --> 14:52.900
You two both go home,
have a nice cup of tea.

14:59.780 --> 15:01.020
So, what do you see?

15:04.100 --> 15:05.340
Nothing odd.

15:05.380 --> 15:07.339
Then, why steal the miniature?

15:07.340 --> 15:09.979
Because, presumably,
there's something in it

15:09.980 --> 15:12.660
that's not in
its life-size counterpart.

15:12.700 --> 15:13.860
Well, I made that miniature.

15:13.900 --> 15:15.460
If there was a clue,
I would've seen it.

15:16.860 --> 15:21.300
I don't doubt your acuity,
but we all have our blind spots.

15:23.980 --> 15:25.540
What do you two think you're doing?

15:27.580 --> 15:28.580
Detective games?

15:30.020 --> 15:31.060
Amateur sleuths?

15:32.900 --> 15:33.900
A waste of time.

15:37.380 --> 15:38.980
And why's that?

15:39.020 --> 15:40.580
Because there's nothing to find.

15:42.060 --> 15:43.540
It was an accident,

15:43.580 --> 15:45.699
just like everyone says.

15:45.700 --> 15:47.619
Yes, well,
that may be true of Florence,

15:47.620 --> 15:48.860
but not of the chief inspector.

15:50.420 --> 15:52.596
Which means it might
be connected to my mother's murder.

15:52.620 --> 15:54.420
It wasn't murder.

15:54.460 --> 15:56.060
I should know.

15:56.100 --> 15:57.340
I was there.

16:00.740 --> 16:01.740
I see.

16:04.420 --> 16:07.580
And did you see Agnes's
mother's fall? Heard it.

16:09.260 --> 16:11.300
Found her at the foot of the stairs,

16:11.340 --> 16:14.340
ran and got Wilbur,
he got an ambulance,

16:14.380 --> 16:15.419
but she was already...

16:15.420 --> 16:17.420
And yet, strangely,
you didn't wake me up, did you?

16:18.620 --> 16:19.659
Why was that?

16:19.660 --> 16:22.019
I told you at the time, I wanted...

16:22.020 --> 16:23.460
I didn't want to upset you.

16:23.500 --> 16:25.900
An excuse that sounds
as weak now as it did then.

16:25.940 --> 16:28.620
There's nothing weak
about wanting to protect you.

16:41.980 --> 16:44.739
I was outside smoking a cigarette.

16:44.740 --> 16:48.540
I heard a scream, I came
running, like everyone else.

16:48.580 --> 16:49.660
And yet, no-one saw you.

16:51.940 --> 16:53.300
There was no-one else there.

16:53.340 --> 16:54.779
That's unfortunate, isn't it?

16:54.780 --> 16:56.580
It's also beside the point.

16:56.620 --> 16:59.420
You have no right
to be investigating this murder.

16:59.460 --> 17:01.820
It's like your daughter said,

17:01.860 --> 17:03.260
you're just as much a suspect as...

17:03.300 --> 17:04.380
There's blood on your coat.

17:05.700 --> 17:06.700
Planted there.

17:08.660 --> 17:09.940
And you have no alibi.

17:15.700 --> 17:18.180
As far as I'm concerned, that's
more than enough to charge you.

17:23.859 --> 17:25.020
What do you mean, protect me?

17:26.260 --> 17:27.540
Protect me from what?

17:27.579 --> 17:29.861
Why didn't you ask me to help
build your mother's diorama?

17:31.740 --> 17:33.540
Because you thought
I might have done it?

17:35.820 --> 17:37.420
And I had reason, didn't I?

17:38.780 --> 17:39.900
That's why you ended things.

17:41.300 --> 17:43.700
It had nothing to do with you
respecting her final wishes.

17:45.420 --> 17:48.180
It was because you thought
I might have killed her.

17:49.860 --> 17:51.380
You had the strongest motive.

17:51.420 --> 17:52.420
Meaning what?

17:53.500 --> 17:54.500
You know what I mean.

17:54.540 --> 17:55.900
I want to hear you say it.

17:59.380 --> 18:00.380
Love.

18:02.660 --> 18:04.020
That hasn't changed.

18:15.820 --> 18:19.860
Father, your surveillance skills
leave a lot to be desired.

18:23.740 --> 18:25.620
It's the hat.

18:25.660 --> 18:27.940
Sometimes I forget to take it off.

18:29.020 --> 18:31.219
I suppose you have some questions.

18:31.220 --> 18:32.740
One or two, yes.

18:34.620 --> 18:36.179
My mother forbade it.

18:36.180 --> 18:38.699
An immigrant carpenter?

18:38.700 --> 18:39.899
Jesus was a carpenter.

18:39.900 --> 18:42.260
Let's just say
she wasn't progressively minded.

18:43.860 --> 18:46.460
I was still
going to marry him, though.

18:46.500 --> 18:47.500
I didn't care.

18:48.740 --> 18:50.140
I loved him.

18:50.180 --> 18:52.099
And then, your mother was killed.

18:52.100 --> 18:53.780
After that,
how could I go through with it?

18:56.060 --> 18:58.140
Did she know Daniel
was in your room that night?

18:59.500 --> 19:00.500
We were careful.

19:01.980 --> 19:04.140
She could have discovered him
while you were asleep.

19:05.780 --> 19:07.780
He got up to use the water closet

19:07.820 --> 19:09.900
and there was an altercation.

19:11.500 --> 19:13.259
A plausible theory.

19:13.260 --> 19:14.380
One that I've had myself.

19:15.540 --> 19:17.340
And yet,
you continue to work with him.

19:17.380 --> 19:18.580
Keep your enemies close.

19:19.620 --> 19:20.980
I don't believe that's the truth.

19:22.420 --> 19:23.460
You still love him.

19:25.300 --> 19:27.300
It's a purely
professional relationship now.

19:28.980 --> 19:30.940
That's not what I saw.

19:30.980 --> 19:34.700
Father, I didn't invite you
to investigate my personal life.

19:34.740 --> 19:36.420
Agnes, that's exactly what you did.

19:36.460 --> 19:38.699
Murder does not exist in a vacuum,

19:38.700 --> 19:41.500
and the stories
in your dioramas testify to that.

19:41.540 --> 19:42.660
CAR DOOR CLOSING

19:46.940 --> 19:48.620
Well?

19:48.660 --> 19:49.780
I've charged him.

19:51.700 --> 19:52.780
Let me talk to your father.

19:53.740 --> 19:56.860
Fresh pair of eyes, new perspective.
That's what you want, isn't it?

20:06.700 --> 20:08.699
What can I do for you, Father?

20:08.700 --> 20:12.340
I just wanted to congratulate you
on the apprehension of the killer.

20:12.380 --> 20:13.780
Thank you.

20:13.820 --> 20:16.860
I imagine that the evidence
against Inspector Mallory must be

20:16.900 --> 20:20.140
quite overwhelming, for you
to have charged him so quickly.

20:22.700 --> 20:23.940
I've heard about you.

20:23.980 --> 20:25.220
The sleuthing priest.

20:26.460 --> 20:27.620
Quite endearing, really.

20:27.660 --> 20:29.100
Well, murder's not endearing.

20:30.100 --> 20:31.380
You don't have to tell me that.

20:31.420 --> 20:34.300
My job isn't exactly
a walk through a rose-garden.

20:37.220 --> 20:40.900
I see human wickedness,

20:40.940 --> 20:43.460
and whatever my disagreements
with Inspector Mallory...

20:46.540 --> 20:49.580
..I have not seen
that wickedness within him.

20:50.620 --> 20:51.740
A pure soul?

20:52.860 --> 20:53.860
Not entirely.

20:55.900 --> 20:57.260
But not murderous.

20:58.540 --> 21:01.219
Father, I don't know how
many officers have told you to

21:01.220 --> 21:02.740
keep your nose out in your time...

21:02.780 --> 21:05.139
Words to that effect
have been spoken before.

21:05.140 --> 21:06.420
..but I mean it, when I say it.

21:07.700 --> 21:10.659
I won't tolerate obstruction
of justice and any such behaviour

21:10.660 --> 21:12.500
will be met with
the full force of the law.

21:13.780 --> 21:14.820
Thank you, sir.

21:16.700 --> 21:18.620
And, er, once again...

21:21.100 --> 21:22.900
..congratulations.

21:22.940 --> 21:24.340
CLOCK CHIMES

21:31.660 --> 21:33.660
Are you sure
you want me to pursue this?

21:36.300 --> 21:38.140
Perhaps it's better
left to someone else.

21:39.780 --> 21:42.340
I want to follow the truth,

21:42.380 --> 21:43.380
no matter where it leads.

21:47.060 --> 21:48.260
Agnes...

21:54.180 --> 21:55.580
What is it?

21:59.700 --> 22:02.620
Someone has filled in your
little sister's height lines.

22:20.740 --> 22:21.780
Violet.

22:26.900 --> 22:29.540
She's even wearing the summer dress
she had on the day she drowned.

22:31.580 --> 22:33.140
Who would do something like this?

22:34.820 --> 22:35.820
And why?

22:39.780 --> 22:41.020
What are you looking at me for?

22:42.020 --> 22:43.500
The craftsmanship of the doll.

22:43.540 --> 22:44.740
Why would I do this?

22:46.020 --> 22:48.779
I think it's obvious
what's going on.

22:48.780 --> 22:50.900
I don't understand
why none of you are saying it.

22:54.340 --> 22:55.460
It's Violet's ghost.

22:56.740 --> 23:00.459
Don't look at me like
I'm stupid. I mean, look at it!

23:00.460 --> 23:03.220
Drawing in her own height lines,
like she thinks she's still alive.

23:05.060 --> 23:06.060
A lost soul.

23:07.660 --> 23:11.979
If we rule out
the supernatural connection -

23:11.980 --> 23:15.500
just for a moment -
then that inevitably draws us to

23:15.540 --> 23:19.260
the conclusion that somebody set
the scene as some sort of message.

23:20.580 --> 23:21.660
Saying what?

23:22.620 --> 23:28.619
A connection is being made between
Florence's fall down the stairs

23:28.620 --> 23:30.420
and Violet's death.

23:30.460 --> 23:33.859
That's ridiculous. The only killer
in this case is Inspector Mallory

23:33.860 --> 23:35.820
and I've no doubt
he'll hang for what he's done.

23:38.220 --> 23:39.259
In the meantime,

23:39.260 --> 23:42.420
I believe the time for house guests
is well and truly over.

23:51.940 --> 23:53.020
May I join you?

23:55.340 --> 23:57.700
I thought my husband
ordered you out.

23:57.740 --> 23:58.740
DOOR CLOSING

23:59.900 --> 24:00.900
He did.

24:07.220 --> 24:09.260
Which means, I need
to get straight to the point.

24:11.980 --> 24:15.820
You know that Inspector
Mallory's innocent, don't you?

24:15.860 --> 24:17.260
What makes you say that?

24:19.620 --> 24:23.660
I'm not accusing you of killing
Detective Chief Inspector Webb.

24:23.700 --> 24:24.660
Then, what?

24:24.700 --> 24:28.145
I'm accusing you of concealing
Inspector Mallory's innocence.

24:30.420 --> 24:32.356
I suspect it's something personal.

24:36.060 --> 24:37.860
Do all priests read minds, Father?

24:38.940 --> 24:39.940
No.

24:42.980 --> 24:44.580
I was so pretty,

24:44.620 --> 24:45.620
so young.

24:47.380 --> 24:49.660
Do you know, the camera adored me?

24:49.700 --> 24:50.860
Everyone did.

24:50.900 --> 24:51.980
Now...

24:54.380 --> 24:55.500
Now, what?

24:57.020 --> 24:58.980
I feel like I'm becoming invisible.

25:02.260 --> 25:03.460
Tell me what happened.

25:07.980 --> 25:10.180
I was in the bathroom,
fixing my hair,

25:10.220 --> 25:13.700
and I could see Inspector Mallory
through the window, smoking.

25:18.020 --> 25:19.020
He noticed me.

25:22.020 --> 25:23.860
I acted like I hadn't seen him.

25:26.660 --> 25:27.660
And then, I...

25:32.940 --> 25:34.340
I don't know why I did it, exactly.

25:37.060 --> 25:38.220
What was I thinking?

25:40.700 --> 25:42.300
What does that say about me?

25:43.700 --> 25:44.940
WOMAN SCREAMS

25:49.540 --> 25:51.580
It says you want
what everyone wants.

25:53.260 --> 25:54.620
To be loved.

25:55.900 --> 25:57.180
To be wanted.

25:57.220 --> 25:58.300
To be seen.

26:01.340 --> 26:02.340
Thank you, Father.

26:05.500 --> 26:06.660
However...

26:08.740 --> 26:12.540
..that leaves you with
a difficult, ethical obligation.

26:12.580 --> 26:14.219
What are you talking about?

26:14.220 --> 26:16.699
You are
Inspector Mallory's only alibi.

26:16.700 --> 26:19.060
The only person
who can exonerate him.

26:20.300 --> 26:23.259
You want me to tell my husband
that I practically did

26:23.260 --> 26:25.340
a striptease in front
of one of his colleagues?

26:26.820 --> 26:30.580
I'm not saying the conversation
won't be awkward,

26:30.620 --> 26:34.060
but if you don't have it,

26:34.100 --> 26:35.620
he will hang.

26:41.460 --> 26:42.460
You whore.

26:45.260 --> 26:46.460
There's no need for that.

26:47.700 --> 26:50.140
I thought I'd told you to leave.
And what about you?

26:51.580 --> 26:53.540
Leching after everything in sight.

26:53.580 --> 26:56.820
Getting too old for you, am I?

26:56.860 --> 26:58.859
It's like Father Brown said.

26:58.860 --> 26:59.940
I'm invisible to you.

27:02.940 --> 27:05.940
Well, no, I didn't quite...

27:05.980 --> 27:07.780
You told her what?

27:10.820 --> 27:12.820
All I did was advise her
to tell the truth.

27:14.340 --> 27:17.740
Sometimes, it has
a way of setting you free.

27:20.420 --> 27:21.580
Free.

27:22.700 --> 27:23.700
Exactly.

27:25.060 --> 27:26.060
I'm leaving you.

27:40.300 --> 27:41.700
Good to have you back, sir.

27:41.740 --> 27:44.156
Just because you're off the hook
for murder doesn't mean I won't

27:44.180 --> 27:45.579
see you charged as a Peeping Tom.

27:45.580 --> 27:46.580
PHONE RINGS

27:46.620 --> 27:48.300
In my defence,

27:48.340 --> 27:50.420
she made it
very difficult not to look.

27:52.500 --> 27:54.939
Erm, Scotland Yard, sir.

27:54.940 --> 27:56.740
An officer's on his way
to take over the case.

28:02.460 --> 28:04.139
What are you doing here?

28:04.140 --> 28:07.260
Erm, I convinced
Mrs Lesser to come forward.

28:09.140 --> 28:10.540
Oh.

28:10.580 --> 28:12.180
Then, I suppose I owe you...

28:12.220 --> 28:14.780
A debt... of gratitude?

28:14.820 --> 28:16.340
Yes.

28:20.540 --> 28:25.380
It's uncanny how accurate
Agnes Lesser's diorama is.

28:27.860 --> 28:29.659
As if she's got
a photographic memory.

28:29.660 --> 28:32.019
But there's nothing here
that suggests Florence Lesser

28:32.020 --> 28:33.260
was murdered.

28:35.980 --> 28:37.180
Erm...

28:38.220 --> 28:39.500
What?

28:39.540 --> 28:41.620
The miniature newspaper.

28:41.660 --> 28:43.540
Whatever's in there is the key.

28:46.540 --> 28:47.780
And I think I know where it is.

28:52.740 --> 28:53.980
My umbrella!

28:58.660 --> 28:59.660
What do you hope to find?

29:00.700 --> 29:02.140
The miniature newspaper, sir.

29:04.220 --> 29:05.220
Where is it?

29:05.221 --> 29:06.300
How should I know?

29:07.980 --> 29:09.219
Arms, please.

29:09.220 --> 29:11.180
I've obliged you far enough.

29:11.220 --> 29:13.356
Until you can obtain
a search warrant, I'm ordering you

29:13.380 --> 29:14.540
off the premises.

29:14.580 --> 29:16.339
You killed her, didn't you?

29:16.340 --> 29:17.860
I won't dignify that with an answer.

29:23.300 --> 29:24.420
What do we do now then, sir?

29:25.540 --> 29:27.059
We put our feet up.

29:27.060 --> 29:28.580
Scotland Yard can take it from here.

29:42.380 --> 29:43.380
It wasn't in his desk.

29:43.420 --> 29:44.860
As I suspected.

29:44.900 --> 29:46.379
But don't worry,

29:46.380 --> 29:47.860
I've organised a search party.

29:52.060 --> 29:53.140
We got your SOS.

29:56.420 --> 29:59.259
Now that we're
deemed worthy to be here.

29:59.260 --> 30:01.460
Mrs McCarthy, Bunty,

30:01.500 --> 30:03.260
thank you for coming to our aid.

30:03.300 --> 30:04.660
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

30:04.700 --> 30:06.899
I don't understand why you
still think it's in the house.

30:06.900 --> 30:08.699
Surely, he would've burnt it by now?

30:08.700 --> 30:10.779
It was the way he looked at it.

30:10.780 --> 30:12.220
It meant something to him.

30:12.260 --> 30:14.819
He couldn't have destroyed it,
even if he wanted to.

30:14.820 --> 30:17.860
And how are we supposed to find
something so tiny in a house so big?

30:19.780 --> 30:21.340
We'll split up.

30:21.380 --> 30:22.459
Where is your father?

30:22.460 --> 30:24.220
He's in the garden,
having another drink.

30:24.260 --> 30:26.220
And where is his wife?

30:26.260 --> 30:28.300
She's packed her things and gone.

30:28.340 --> 30:29.420
Good for her.

30:33.580 --> 30:34.740
I want to show you something.

30:39.900 --> 30:41.260
In the photograph,

30:41.300 --> 30:44.139
your mother's hand is parallel
with her face,

30:44.140 --> 30:46.779
and is touching the bloodstain,

30:46.780 --> 30:50.820
but in the diorama, her hand is
pointing towards the table.

30:50.860 --> 30:52.220
But I got everything else right.

30:56.140 --> 30:57.140
True.

30:58.580 --> 31:03.419
Maybe somebody moved her arm before
or after the photograph was taken?

31:03.420 --> 31:06.500
Either way, all I can tell you is
this - that's how I remember it.

32:23.860 --> 32:25.900
Father, it's Mrs McCarthy!

32:25.940 --> 32:27.980
She's trapped, hiding from Wilbur.

32:31.420 --> 32:32.540
In plain sight.

32:34.660 --> 32:35.700
What does it mean?

32:57.060 --> 32:58.060
SHE SOBS

33:16.900 --> 33:18.540
My God, you're like a bad penny.

33:20.060 --> 33:22.460
You killed Chief Inspector Webb,

33:22.500 --> 33:26.059
and then planted blood on Inspector
Mallory's coat, didn't you?

33:26.060 --> 33:28.620
Not to protect yourself,
but to protect the real culprit

33:32.180 --> 33:36.179
Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea culpa.

33:36.180 --> 33:37.180
"My fault".

33:37.220 --> 33:38.620
It's Agnes's writing, isn't it?

33:41.060 --> 33:45.859
But she has no memory
of writing in the miniature.

33:45.860 --> 33:49.740
And I suspect she has no memory
of several other things, too.

33:49.780 --> 33:52.180
You don't know
what you're talking about.

33:52.220 --> 33:54.059
You can't keep
running away from this.

33:54.060 --> 33:55.180
Mr Lesser!

33:58.860 --> 33:59.940
MUSIC BOX PLAYING

34:01.980 --> 34:03.380
I managed to escape.

34:03.420 --> 34:04.739
I can see that.

34:04.740 --> 34:06.459
It's all right. We found it.

34:06.460 --> 34:07.620
Thank God for that.

34:07.660 --> 34:08.659
CHILD-LIKE SINGING

34:10.340 --> 34:11.500
What's that sound?

34:14.780 --> 34:15.980
Is it someone singing?

34:19.460 --> 34:20.460
Agnes?

34:23.500 --> 34:25.540
IN A CHILD'S VOICE:
Do you want to play with me?

34:27.980 --> 34:29.179
We could go swimming.

34:31.659 --> 34:33.340
I like swimming.

34:33.380 --> 34:35.340
Agnes, what is going on?

34:38.139 --> 34:40.340
I'm not Agnes, silly.

34:51.300 --> 34:52.300
I'm Violet.

34:55.020 --> 34:57.500
Be careful of Agnes.

34:57.540 --> 34:58.660
Why's that?

35:02.540 --> 35:04.139
She killed me.

35:04.140 --> 35:05.140
Agnes!

35:06.780 --> 35:08.819
NORMAL VOICE: What just happened?

35:08.820 --> 35:10.580
You were acting like...

35:10.620 --> 35:11.700
Like what?

35:11.740 --> 35:14.140
Like you were a little girl.

35:14.180 --> 35:15.860
You said your name was Violet.

35:15.900 --> 35:16.940
What?

35:18.540 --> 35:22.620
This may seem indelicate, but I
think you should see a psychiatrist.

35:55.860 --> 35:58.140
You killed an innocent man.

35:58.180 --> 36:00.340
You have to face up
to that, if nothing else.

36:00.380 --> 36:01.979
You have no evidence.

36:01.980 --> 36:03.780
I know why you couldn't
destroy the newspaper.

36:05.740 --> 36:09.100
Because what she wrote was
part of herself, a part that knew

36:09.140 --> 36:12.940
what she'd done, that wanted
to confess and say sorry.

36:16.060 --> 36:17.460
How could I destroy that?

36:18.900 --> 36:20.100
What's the matter with her?

36:22.100 --> 36:25.460
It's a fugue state she goes into.

36:25.500 --> 36:28.259
It's some form
of multiple-personality disorder.

36:28.260 --> 36:30.660
The first time it happened
was when she was ten years old.

36:32.500 --> 36:33.660
Violet's death.

36:35.780 --> 36:37.540
Florence and I
discovered them in the river.

36:39.620 --> 36:40.620
Agnes...

36:42.260 --> 36:44.780
..holding Violet's head underwater.

36:44.820 --> 36:46.060
Oh.

36:47.580 --> 36:49.740
We pulled Agnes away.

36:49.780 --> 36:50.900
She seemed almost catatonic.

36:52.580 --> 36:56.420
And then, moments later,
she came round,

36:56.460 --> 36:59.700
started screaming
when she saw what had happened.

37:01.940 --> 37:03.540
No memory
that she'd done it herself.

37:06.620 --> 37:07.980
Why didn't you get her help?

37:09.540 --> 37:10.660
What kind of help, hmm?

37:11.660 --> 37:13.740
Locked up in an institution?
Lobotomised?

37:15.700 --> 37:17.140
Besides, we hoped it was a one-off,

37:17.180 --> 37:22.940
some, sort of, strange,
psychological anomaly, until...

37:25.340 --> 37:26.340
..ten years ago.

37:28.780 --> 37:29.780
Your wife's death.

37:37.500 --> 37:40.740
Florence got out of bed,
just as I said,

37:40.780 --> 37:43.180
but when she got to
the stairwell, Agnes was there.

37:45.020 --> 37:46.100
Only...

37:47.260 --> 37:48.260
...it wasn't Agnes.

37:50.500 --> 37:54.380
Agnes?

37:57.020 --> 37:58.220
Wilbur!

38:00.460 --> 38:02.740
We hoped to get her
to the safety of her room.

38:05.060 --> 38:07.820
Mummy, why didn't you save me?

38:10.100 --> 38:11.780
Why did you let her drown me?

38:13.060 --> 38:14.580
What?

38:14.620 --> 38:16.019
Why didn't you save me?!

38:16.020 --> 38:17.020
MUM SCREAMS

38:26.380 --> 38:27.659
We put her to bed.

38:27.660 --> 38:30.060
She woke up when
the ambulance arrived, distraught.

38:32.780 --> 38:34.140
No memory of what she'd done.

38:36.860 --> 38:40.820
I convinced Daniel
it was an accident,

38:40.860 --> 38:41.900
for Agnes's sake.

38:45.540 --> 38:47.540
It's all been for Agnes's sake.

38:48.620 --> 38:50.220
And what about
the people she killed?

38:52.500 --> 38:55.899
And the innocent man
you killed to protect her?

38:55.900 --> 38:58.139
It's time to face the truth.

38:58.140 --> 39:00.780
She is a danger
to herself and other people.

39:02.820 --> 39:05.620
Father!

39:07.100 --> 39:08.619
It's Agnes.

39:08.620 --> 39:09.980
I don't think she's herself.

39:14.180 --> 39:15.260
Agnes?

39:16.860 --> 39:18.220
What's going on?

39:19.900 --> 39:22.700
She's been leaving
herself clues from the very start

39:22.740 --> 39:24.500
and this is the biggest one.

39:26.340 --> 39:27.660
If she's realised.

39:31.260 --> 39:32.260
Agnes?

39:33.300 --> 39:34.300
Agnes!

39:49.340 --> 39:50.540
Agnes.

39:50.580 --> 39:51.580
I remember it.

39:53.340 --> 39:54.380
I remember it all.

39:56.420 --> 39:57.420
My mother.

39:59.300 --> 40:00.460
My sister.

40:02.980 --> 40:04.100
What am I?

40:07.020 --> 40:08.220
You're someone who needs help.

40:10.260 --> 40:11.260
Agnes, please...

40:14.940 --> 40:16.659
This is not the way out,

40:16.660 --> 40:19.539
no matter how dark things may seem

40:19.540 --> 40:21.219
at the moment.

40:21.220 --> 40:22.220
There's something...

40:23.820 --> 40:25.460
...evil inside me.

40:25.500 --> 40:26.660
You're not evil.

40:28.140 --> 40:29.140
You're unwell.

40:31.100 --> 40:33.140
And beneath the illness,
there is good.

40:35.340 --> 40:39.460
Good?! Why else
would you make a confession?

40:41.340 --> 40:44.699
You positioned your mother's
arm in the diorama to point at

40:44.700 --> 40:48.620
the newspaper, because you knew that
the chief inspector would notice

40:48.660 --> 40:50.940
the discrepancy,
find the newspaper...

40:53.940 --> 40:54.940
..and see this.

41:00.260 --> 41:02.060
Because of what you've done...

41:03.780 --> 41:07.259
..you desperately seek redemption.

41:07.260 --> 41:09.140
There's no redemption
for me, Father.

41:10.780 --> 41:14.180
There's only what I've done.
The acts I've committed.

41:14.220 --> 41:17.139
I told you I wanted
to follow the truth,

41:17.140 --> 41:19.900
no matter where it leads.
And this is where it's led.

41:19.940 --> 41:21.940
I have to accept that.

41:21.980 --> 41:23.340
And for the protection of others,

41:23.380 --> 41:25.419
I have to do the only thing
that's right.

41:25.420 --> 41:26.820
Agnes!

41:26.860 --> 41:29.100
Just let me go, Father!

41:29.140 --> 41:32.580
If you let go,

41:32.620 --> 41:33.740
you will pull me over.

41:33.780 --> 41:35.500
You're being selfish!

41:36.700 --> 41:37.780
No, I'm not. She's here!

41:59.540 --> 42:00.780
MUSIC BOX PLAYS

42:09.100 --> 42:11.139
Good news about your father.

42:11.140 --> 42:13.540
He was given a custodial sentence.

42:13.580 --> 42:16.180
The judge took into account
his advancing years

42:16.220 --> 42:18.100
and his decades of public service.

42:21.260 --> 42:22.460
He escaped the noose.

42:24.740 --> 42:25.900
Thank God.

42:28.500 --> 42:29.700
I thought you were an atheist?

42:31.060 --> 42:32.220
It was a figure of speech.

42:33.660 --> 42:35.060
Hmm.

42:36.740 --> 42:37.859
Ha!

42:37.860 --> 42:39.740
I hear the music box
is sounding better.

42:41.180 --> 42:42.340
I gave it some oil.

42:42.380 --> 42:43.580
I thought it was about time.

42:45.140 --> 42:48.740
An apple tart from Mrs McCarthy,
by way of celebration.

42:51.340 --> 42:56.340
And the diorama
is coming on famously. Yes.

42:59.060 --> 43:01.420
I'm not sure who I'm going
to have killed yet, though.

43:03.940 --> 43:05.460
I thought that you...

43:05.500 --> 43:08.020
Oh, relax, it was a joke.

43:10.860 --> 43:14.340
This is just for, erm...
I suppose you might call it "fun".

43:16.300 --> 43:17.380
Hmm. Which reminds me.

43:21.420 --> 43:22.580
Oh!

43:26.380 --> 43:27.739
I thought I'd leave it up to you.

43:27.740 --> 43:29.380
Where do you want him?

43:31.220 --> 43:33.580
Erm, well...

43:35.820 --> 43:37.780
I think he should
be taking a stroll.

43:39.660 --> 43:40.860
Perfect.

43:48.820 --> 43:50.420
Right.

43:50.460 --> 43:52.260
Well, I'll go and get some plates...

43:52.300 --> 43:53.899
SHE HUMS ALONG WITH MUSIC BOX

43:53.900 --> 43:55.140
...for the apple tart.

43:55.180 --> 43:56.500
SHE CONTINUES HUMMING

44:04.260 --> 44:07.260
SHE SINGS MUSIC BOX TUNE
