What the...?

00:21.320 --> 00:22.190
Where do you think you're going?

00:24.500 --> 00:25.930
I mean, you just don't think i can let you...

01:00.130 --> 01:00.790
Excuse me?

01:02.050 --> 01:03.620
Is there a trick to getting some help around here?

01:03.620 --> 01:05.870
Other then being charming and beautiful, no, ma'am.

01:05.870 --> 01:09.750
I need to know which of these to buy--
the 3000-z or the 3000-z-x.

01:09.750 --> 01:10.620
Excellent question.

01:10.620 --> 01:13.120
Uh, you need to talk to one of our green shirts about that.

01:13.120 --> 01:14.200
I can actually call one to assist you.

01:14.200 --> 01:15.190
I'm not a salesman.

01:15.190 --> 01:16.360
I'm actually part of the nerd herd.

01:16.360 --> 01:18.350
You must be so proud of yourself.

01:18.550 --> 01:20.410
I wouldn't go so far as to say proud.

01:26.100 --> 01:27.020
So sorry.

01:28.910 --> 01:29.600
One einute.

01:31.820 --> 01:32.680

Chanting: mystery crisper.

01:45.470 --> 01:46.540
Guys, sorry, sorry to break up...

01:46.540 --> 01:48.010
You want in?
It's gonna cost you five bucks.

01:48.790 --> 01:49.570
What's going on?

01:49.570 --> 01:51.180
Final round.Mystery crisper.

01:51.540 --> 01:53.740
Chanting: mystery crisper!
Mystery crisper!

01:53.740 --> 01:57.810
The great crisper, where employee food goes to die.

01:57.810 --> 01:58.640
????

01:58.640 --> 02:01.610
Guys, there's going to be a riot on the sales
floor if you don't get back to work.

02:01.650 --> 02:03.690
Chuck, shut up.

02:04.610 --> 02:05.320
??

02:05.980 --> 02:07.200
????

02:07.410 --> 02:09.120
He's got it?

02:09.759 --> 02:11.460
He's the man, the man.

02:18.040 --> 02:19.200
He wants his weapon.

02:28.750 --> 02:32.810
Morgan is so awesome.
He can eat anything.

02:40.060 --> 02:40.610
Bartowski.

02:40.880 --> 02:41.700
Yeah!
Yes!

02:42.300 --> 02:43.460
I need to see you in my office.

02:43.460 --> 02:45.190
I-i was just on my way.

02:47.780 --> 02:50.640
Daddy mad, chuck.
Daddy mad.

02:50.640 --> 02:52.950
Might as well kiss that promotion good-bye.

02:56.460 --> 02:58.020
- Get in here, bartowski.
- Yes, sir.

03:00.300 --> 03:01.110
Tell me...

03:02.120 --> 03:04.130
What's the best part of being buy more brass?

03:04.610 --> 03:05.730
The power?

03:06.460 --> 03:07.350
The money?

03:07.680 --> 03:08.410
The ladies?

03:08.410 --> 03:09.320
The medical.

03:09.710 --> 03:12.270
I couldn't give a rodent's behind about this job.

03:12.270 --> 03:13.230
But this...

03:13.850 --> 03:15.510
My body is my temple.

03:15.890 --> 03:17.440
And i must treat it as such.

03:18.200 --> 03:19.520
Is that...
Is that all, sir?

03:19.520 --> 03:21.920
'Cause i-i really should, uh, get back to work.

03:21.920 --> 03:24.080
- No, that is not all.Sit down.
- Okay.

03:28.200 --> 03:30.890
There's a guy coming in here from corporate to interview you

03:30.890 --> 03:33.270
and tang for the assistant manager spot.

03:33.620 --> 03:36.870
Now tang's has the charm of a prostate exam.

03:37.190 --> 03:38.810
For some reason, people seem to like you.

03:39.150 --> 03:41.760
If the hr guy likes you, the job is yours.

03:41.870 --> 03:42.970
So is the medical.

03:43.320 --> 03:44.330
Don't screw up.

03:44.330 --> 03:45.990
I'll, uh, i'll do my best.

03:45.990 --> 03:47.940
Make sure morgan does his best, too.

03:48.120 --> 03:50.740
That kid is gonna be the anchor around your neck, bartowski.

03:59.080 --> 04:01.870
What, we don't have enough actual cobwebs already?

04:02.270 --> 04:04.200
I'm getting ready for our annual halloween party.

04:04.200 --> 04:06.310
What time are you getting here?

04:06.310 --> 04:08.300
Oh, you know what, i might be late.

04:08.300 --> 04:12.660
They finally scheduled that
promotional-interview thing for that afternoon.

04:12.660 --> 04:14.990
We can just make it an assistant manager party, too, then.

04:14.990 --> 04:16.980
Sure, yeah, if you feel like jinxing it.

04:17.959 --> 04:20.079
You're just finally growing up, aren't you?

04:21.120 --> 04:23.150
Do you think that this year would be a good time for you

04:23.150 --> 04:24.890
and morgan to have separate costumes?

04:25.560 --> 04:27.870
Excuse me, but what's wrong with our costume?

04:27.870 --> 04:32.220
Um, i'm sorry, but the whole
two-man-sea-cucumber-thing is kind of creepy.

04:32.220 --> 04:35.220
First of all, it's a sandworm, okay?

04:35.220 --> 04:36.700
Shai-hulud, to be specific.

04:36.700 --> 04:40.380
And second of all, dune fans have been going
nuts over our costume since the eighth grade.

04:40.380 --> 04:41.330
Captain: yo.

04:41.660 --> 04:42.540
Chuckster.

04:43.560 --> 04:44.770
Guess what i am?

04:45.320 --> 04:46.400
You're...

04:46.620 --> 04:47.430
Naked?

04:47.430 --> 04:48.380
I'm adam.

04:48.380 --> 04:50.470
You know, like adam and eve, adam.

04:50.470 --> 04:51.670
Wait till you see my snake.

04:51.670 --> 04:53.540
I don't want to see your snake.

04:53.940 --> 04:57.420
Devon, chuck here has an interview on wednesday.

04:57.750 --> 05:00.610
That is outstanding.

05:02.980 --> 05:04.170
I gotta...
Excuse me.

05:04.170 --> 05:06.150
Hello?
Hello?

05:06.150 --> 05:07.250
I'm getting tense!

05:07.250 --> 05:08.800
You know i don't like being tense.

05:08.800 --> 05:10.170
How can i help you relax, big mike?

05:10.170 --> 05:11.540
Find that jackass morgan.

05:11.540 --> 05:14.700
Your buddy's supposed to be working
a double shift today and went awol.

05:21.550 --> 05:23.180
Hey, hey, buddy, morgan.

05:23.370 --> 05:24.250
- Where you been?What's up, buddy?
- Yes.

05:24.250 --> 05:26.420
Where have you been?
I've been trying to call you.

05:26.420 --> 05:28.850
I, uh, i picked up the sandworm costume from the dry cleaners.

05:28.850 --> 05:31.810
The ranch dressing from last year totally came out,
so we're all good.

05:32.010 --> 05:34.330
You ready to win another buy more costume contest?

05:34.330 --> 05:38.190
No.No, no, 'cause you're
supposed to be at work, buddy.

05:38.190 --> 05:41.210
Dude, i got ten big ones riding on this quote-unquote videogame,

05:41.210 --> 05:42.560
so can i just have, uh...

05:43.010 --> 05:44.750
This guy's been handing me my ass all week.

05:45.900 --> 05:47.540
Time to return the favor.

05:51.650 --> 05:53.240
????

06:04.310 --> 06:05.600
- Uh, morgan.
- Yeah, buddy?

06:06.030 --> 06:07.450
Morgan, this guy is dangerous.

06:07.450 --> 06:11.090
Well, morgan's dangerous, chucky.
Morgan's dangerous.

06:15.370 --> 06:17.180
Oh, what a baby.

06:17.800 --> 06:19.070
What a loser.

06:20.560 --> 06:22.030
How did you find me?
How did you find me?

06:22.100 --> 06:23.100
Who else knows i'm here?

06:23.100 --> 06:24.050
Who do you work for?

06:24.050 --> 06:25.060
No one.No one.
Let me go.

06:25.060 --> 06:26.800
Look, i don't know what you're talking about.

06:26.800 --> 06:27.950
I know you're a spy!

06:28.470 --> 06:29.170
Your watch?

06:29.170 --> 06:30.340
I designed that watch for the cia.

06:34.990 --> 06:36.500
Are there other agents waiting for me outside?

06:36.870 --> 06:38.410
Are there other agents waiting for me outside?

06:39.520 --> 06:41.040
You're not sneaking away from me.

06:41.040 --> 06:42.440
Wait, whoa, whoa.

06:42.440 --> 06:44.210
You still owe me ten bucks!

06:45.200 --> 06:47.340

06:48.220 --> 06:51.340

07:28.210 --> 07:29.510
She's waiting in your room.

07:29.610 --> 07:30.560
Ellie: is everything okay?

07:30.560 --> 07:32.050
Said she had a surprise for you.

07:32.050 --> 07:33.610
Get in there, slugger.

07:35.050 --> 07:35.660
Hey.

07:36.960 --> 07:39.350
Who is this lazslo character?
He just id'd me as an agent.

07:39.350 --> 07:41.790
Relax.We're looking into him.
And you did the right thing.

07:41.790 --> 07:42.970
I...I didn't do anything.

07:42.970 --> 07:44.140
I just flashed on the guy.

07:44.140 --> 07:47.300
You followed protocol, and i'm going to
check in with you first thing in the morning.

07:47.460 --> 07:49.290
Wait, wait.Wait, wait, hold on, hold on.
Wait, um...

07:50.570 --> 07:55.060
Look, if it's cool with you,

07:55.980 --> 07:58.220
Look, awesome and ellie think that i'm...

07:58.580 --> 08:01.910
Kind of getting lucky in here,

08:03.200 --> 08:03.860
Them.

08:09.520 --> 08:11.810
Uh, how long do you want me to stay?

08:12.240 --> 08:13.860
42 minutes and 15 seconds?

08:15.110 --> 08:16.430
Arcade fire's first album.

08:16.430 --> 08:19.260
It's like an auditory aphrodisiac.

08:20.100 --> 08:22.200
You're not really ready for it yet.

08:24.480 --> 08:25.450
Here we go.

08:25.940 --> 08:26.670
And...

08:39.500 --> 08:42.220
Why were you waiting for me in my room, anyway?

08:42.220 --> 08:45.190
Well, i wanted to surprise you.

08:47.400 --> 08:50.450
Uh, it's, uh, it's us at comic-con.

08:51.130 --> 08:52.000
What do you think?

08:52.650 --> 08:54.770
It's...
It's great.

08:56.390 --> 08:59.260
But we've never actually been to comic-con, have we?

09:01.260 --> 09:02.270
Wow, we...

09:02.740 --> 09:04.720
We actually look like a real couple.

09:05.470 --> 09:06.730
Well, we are a real couple.

09:06.730 --> 09:10.450
We're just a different sort of a couple.

09:13.670 --> 09:14.840
That we are.

09:24.620 --> 09:25.190
You!

09:27.160 --> 09:29.520
What do i have to do to get timely
intel out of you, bartowski?

09:29.520 --> 09:31.090
Look, i briefed sarah last night, all right?

09:31.360 --> 09:32.960
Oh, i bet you did, slugger.

09:34.730 --> 09:37.360
I thought we were all supposed to be part of the same team here,
huh-- team chuck.

09:37.360 --> 09:38.900
We are, but i'm starting to feel like the guy

09:38.900 --> 09:41.450
who always gets picked last,
and i do not like feeling like

09:41.450 --> 09:43.170
Team chuck's little fat kid.

09:43.170 --> 09:46.550
Okay, you know what, the next time i have a flash,
i'll come straight to you, all right, casey?

09:47.330 --> 09:48.370
What did you tell lazslo?

09:48.370 --> 09:49.180
Nothang.

09:50.190 --> 09:53.270
He asked me where i got my watch,
and i told him my girlfriend gave it to me, okay?

09:53.270 --> 09:55.850
So you compromised yourself and agent walker?

09:55.850 --> 09:57.600
Bang up job, chuck.

10:00.650 --> 10:03.630
And so now you and your son are ready to video-chat.

10:04.210 --> 10:05.770
Thank you, young man.

10:05.770 --> 10:09.280
You've been-- great heavens!

10:15.420 --> 10:17.560
This is a whale-tail.

10:17.560 --> 10:21.340
Notice this illusive creature,
seen here frolicking in her natural habitat--

10:21.340 --> 10:23.630
- any sudden movement would-
- give  Me, give me this.

10:23.630 --> 10:24.650
Come on, come on.

10:24.650 --> 10:25.960
Get, shoo, shoo, shoo.

10:25.960 --> 10:27.650
Have fun, go find the video games.

10:28.580 --> 10:29.380
What was that about, man?

10:29.380 --> 10:30.940
Come on, i was this close to closing a sale.

10:30.940 --> 10:32.110
No.You know what you are, morgan?

10:32.110 --> 10:34.870
You are this close to getting fired for sexual harassment.

10:35.910 --> 10:37.830
What happened, chuck?
You used to be cool.

10:37.830 --> 10:38.780
I-i used to be cool?

10:38.780 --> 10:40.660
When was that?
When we were 13?

10:41.070 --> 10:42.640
Well, i'm sorry to go changing on you, buddy.

10:42.640 --> 10:46.040
But if you hadn't noticed,
we are now chronologically-speaking, adults.

10:46.040 --> 10:48.320
So, unless you wanna work retail
for the rest of your life,

10:48.320 --> 10:50.970
and by the way, drag me down
with you in the  Process,

10:50.970 --> 10:52.990
i would suggest that you grow up.

11:03.060 --> 11:04.940
"heavy is the head that wears the crown.

11:05.730 --> 11:08.950
" couldn't help but notice the way you handled that,
uh, morgan situation.

11:08.950 --> 11:12.100
That was most impressive, chuck.

11:12.260 --> 11:13.470
That's great, that's great.

11:13.470 --> 11:14.840
You gave me goose bumps.

11:14.840 --> 11:15.680
Super, jeff.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.030
The intersect was correct to alert us.

11:36.030 --> 11:37.770
We've been looking for lazslo mahnovski

11:37.770 --> 11:40.990
since he escaped from los robles
national labs last month.

11:41.350 --> 11:41.990
Who is he?

11:41.990 --> 11:44.210
Weapons designer.
Government brain.

11:44.210 --> 11:46.820
The target graduated college age 14.

11:47.580 --> 11:49.100
Ph.D.At 17.

11:49.100 --> 11:53.190
Been with us ever since,
working for a clandestine engineering subcontractor.

11:53.190 --> 11:56.220
Lazslo's not the kind of asset
we can afford to lose to our enemies.

11:56.220 --> 11:57.870
Grade-a egghead.
Got it.

11:58.180 --> 11:59.240
What do you want me to do with him?

11:59.240 --> 12:01.380
Bring him in.
And take caution.

12:01.380 --> 12:02.830
What, is he gonna hurt me with his mind?

12:02.830 --> 12:05.130
Well, here's what he did to his handlers.

12:17.900 --> 12:21.100
Nice try, buddy, but, uh,
halloween's tomorrow, okay?

12:21.400 --> 12:22.470
Or today, or today.

12:22.470 --> 12:24.300
It could be today if you want it to be today.

12:25.490 --> 12:26.450
I didn't kill anybody.

12:26.450 --> 12:27.760
Look, i-i never said you did.

12:27.760 --> 12:29.070
Then why am i on the fbi list?

12:29.070 --> 12:30.060
I don't know.
Just calm down.

12:30.060 --> 12:31.210
I was framed, okay.

12:31.590 --> 12:33.390
You have to believe me.
I am not a murderer.

12:33.390 --> 12:35.810
Okay, okay.
I believe you.

12:35.810 --> 12:37.050
But, fyi...

12:37.420 --> 12:39.590
???

12:40.360 --> 12:42.310
You told the undercover agent about me,
didn't you?

12:42.310 --> 12:44.280
He's talking to pentagon operations right now.

12:44.280 --> 12:46.480
I tapped into the encrypted video feed at the store.

12:46.480 --> 12:48.020
I helped design that home theater system.

12:48.020 --> 12:49.890
Look, i-i-i don't know-- gun!

12:50.760 --> 12:52.770
Get it.Get it.
Get it.

12:52.770 --> 12:55.280
I got it, i got it.
I got it.

13:02.680 --> 13:04.050
Is that a water gun?

13:04.050 --> 13:04.660
No.

13:05.280 --> 13:07.040
I'm pretty sure it's dripping on my face.

13:13.070 --> 13:13.870
I'm sorry.

13:16.630 --> 13:17.590
Name's lazslo.

13:18.820 --> 13:19.930
And i need help.

13:20.610 --> 13:21.840
What the hell am i supposed to do?

13:21.840 --> 13:22.840
You're on the inside.

13:23.130 --> 13:24.060
You have access.

13:24.480 --> 13:27.220
Look, unless you help me clear my name,
they're gonna keep chasing me.

13:27.220 --> 13:28.530
You're my only hope.

13:29.690 --> 13:30.430
But first...

13:32.090 --> 13:34.590
I could really use some pancakes.

13:45.890 --> 13:47.230
Hey, where's chuck?

13:47.230 --> 13:49.730
Shouldn't you guys be practicing your snake dance?

13:49.730 --> 13:52.880
It's a sandworm, and...

13:52.880 --> 13:58.100
Chuck's not here, 'cause he's probably off doing
something really mature like seeing an opera.

13:58.100 --> 14:00.030
Or reading.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.070
Come on, babe, let's help the little guy out.

14:02.450 --> 14:04.010
What else did you make for the cia?

14:04.010 --> 14:05.590
Whatever the jobs called for actually.

14:05.590 --> 14:07.990
I mean, if an agent wanted thermal-vision ray bans

14:10.100 --> 14:11.230
i'm the Guy they call.

14:12.010 --> 14:13.690
You're like a real-life q?

14:14.870 --> 14:15.370
You know.

14:18.530 --> 14:19.630
You know q.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.270
The guy who used to make all the gadgets for bond, q?

14:22.270 --> 14:24.110
Bond was that spy-guy, right?

14:24.440 --> 14:26.420
What, have they been keeping you in a friggin' cave?

14:26.420 --> 14:28.170
Underground lab actually.

14:29.010 --> 14:34.050
For the last 10 years,
all i did was work in that lab pretty much.

14:34.380 --> 14:35.430
Well, that and play video games.

14:35.430 --> 14:36.340
But, uh...

14:37.050 --> 14:38.480
No friends, no family.

14:41.100 --> 14:42.350
No bond.

14:42.350 --> 14:45.450
No wonder you blew up all your
research and busted out there.

14:45.450 --> 14:46.730
That's just inhumane.

14:46.980 --> 14:48.310
So what kind of work do you do?

14:48.780 --> 14:51.350
You know, it's kinda, it's kinda,
uh, complicated.

14:51.350 --> 14:52.710
Right, but you gotta be some kind of a genius.

14:53.480 --> 14:54.570
Or prodigy?

14:55.070 --> 14:57.300
I mean feds don't bother recruiting somebody,

14:57.300 --> 15:01.310
guarding them with undercover agents,
unless you're super-good  At sometthing?

15:02.070 --> 15:03.120
What are you super-good at?

15:04.200 --> 15:07.270
Let's just say i'm a computer-guy.

15:09.440 --> 15:11.040
Morgan: ellie, let me ask you a question.

15:11.520 --> 15:14.050
Am i the kind of person you'd categorize as...

15:14.800 --> 15:15.680
Immature?

15:16.460 --> 15:19.070
- Do you really want me to answer that?
- Yes.

15:19.070 --> 15:21.610
Be straight with me.
Fire away both barrels.

15:21.610 --> 15:24.820
Would you mind stepping in the kitchen for a moment, morgan?

15:24.940 --> 15:26.130
I'll handle this one, honey.

15:34.760 --> 15:35.750
Ellie's room.

15:38.810 --> 15:46.430
There comes a time in every man's life when he reaches,
well, a crossroads.

15:46.430 --> 15:48.960
A time when he must ask himself...

15:49.350 --> 15:49.930
Am i a tucker?

15:51.750 --> 15:53.370
Talking about your shirt, morgan.

15:53.370 --> 15:55.140
I wasn't always a tucker, you know.

15:55.140 --> 15:57.750
Then one day, it just happened.

15:57.750 --> 15:59.300
How do you, how do you know it's time?

15:59.300 --> 16:01.180
You just feel it.
Go ahead.x

16:01.180 --> 16:02.690
Tuck her in.
See how she feels.

16:02.690 --> 16:03.440
I don't know.

16:03.440 --> 16:07.190
No, i'm, i'm just kinda happy
with how my shirts hang there.

16:07.190 --> 16:07.920
Come on.

16:08.340 --> 16:09.160
You're safe in here.

16:10.240 --> 16:10.750
Tuck her in.

16:10.750 --> 16:12.470
- I don't if i'm, i-
- do it.Mm-hmm.

16:18.310 --> 16:22.420
I don't know, i-i kinda feel like my,
my junk's out there for the whole world to see.

16:22.960 --> 16:24.540
Maybe that's the point, morgan.

16:25.010 --> 16:26.430
Maybe that's the point.

16:26.430 --> 16:30.820
If there's one thing to being a man,
it's always speaking your mind.

16:31.040 --> 16:31.900
Whatever the cost.

16:31.900 --> 16:34.000
Always be direct, open and honest.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
When i was 12, i hid under ellie's bed,
so i could watch her undress.

16:37.630 --> 16:38.360
Excellent.

16:39.240 --> 16:40.160
What are you looking at?

16:40.160 --> 16:40.930
Your hair.

16:40.930 --> 16:42.870
It's time to tame the mane, buddy.

16:43.500 --> 16:44.980
Let's talk product.

16:45.710 --> 16:48.070
- I gotta finish the job.
- I'm sorry.

16:48.270 --> 16:49.780
Hey, who's that handsome guy in the mirror?

16:50.590 --> 16:51.510
This is great.

16:51.950 --> 16:55.930
I mean just being able to sit in a coffee shop and talk.

16:56.510 --> 16:57.300
Just talk.

16:57.620 --> 16:59.980
With somebody who knows what
it's like working for the companq.

16:59.980 --> 17:03.560
You know, if i had to do it over again,
i never would have gone to that pier.

17:04.180 --> 17:04.900
What pier?

17:05.880 --> 17:07.339
I was 11...

17:08.060 --> 17:08.839
And...

17:10.609 --> 17:13.500
Some agent saw me playing tetris at an arcade.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.790
So he asked me if i can take all these tests.

17:15.790 --> 17:18.349
The next thing i know,
he's offering to pay my way through school.

17:18.349 --> 17:20.619
My parents, like, they didn't know what to do with a kid

17:20.619 --> 17:22.190
whose iq is higher than both theirs combined.

17:23.700 --> 17:24.800
So they signed me over.

17:25.569 --> 17:28.390
And that's when i became property of
the united states government.

17:31.190 --> 17:32.100
Sweet story, huh?

17:34.230 --> 17:35.910
I'm a little, i'm a little strapped.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.290
You know how government work pays.

17:39.290 --> 17:40.100
Dude, yeah.

17:40.100 --> 17:41.680
No, no, no, no, don't even worry about it.

17:42.420 --> 17:44.210
Here.
Here's an iou.

17:45.760 --> 17:46.570
Thanks.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.330
Chuck, listen you can't tell
your handlers you ever saw me.

17:52.720 --> 17:53.720
What?Why?

17:53.720 --> 17:56.140
They can help you, lazslo.
They're the good guys.

17:56.330 --> 17:57.960
There's no such thing in this business.

17:58.350 --> 17:59.310
I mean, you don't believe me?

17:59.310 --> 18:00.880
Go home and search your room.

18:00.880 --> 18:04.060
See what kind of bugs your good guy handlers planted on you.

18:05.050 --> 18:10.510
From now on, you should trust your handlers
precisely as much as they trust you.

19:13.020 --> 19:13.890
* what the hell are these?

19:15.610 --> 19:17.100
Seems you already know, chuck.

19:17.100 --> 19:20.130
I can't believe you've been prying
into my most intimate moments...

19:21.100 --> 19:21.610
You know what?

19:21.610 --> 19:25.170
I swear to god, if i find out you've been spying on my sister,
i will kill you, casey.

19:25.170 --> 19:26.220
Intimate moments?

19:26.920 --> 19:28.870
Not really an issue thus far.

19:29.870 --> 19:33.180
At least, not in the sense of traditional two-person intimacy.

19:33.180 --> 19:33.830
He-he-he.

19:33.830 --> 19:35.770
Do you have any idea how violated i feel right now?

19:35.770 --> 19:36.710
You feel violated?

19:36.710 --> 19:38.950
No, no, no, my ears feel violated.

19:38.950 --> 19:43.370
'Cause they have to listen to you and
that moron morgan yammering on for four hours

19:43.370 --> 19:46.320
about what sandwich  You're gonna take
if you were stranded on a deserted island.

19:46.320 --> 19:47.210
What are you nuts?

19:47.210 --> 19:49.110
Nobody was talking about sandwiches for four hours.

19:49.110 --> 19:49.940
Come on.

19:50.420 --> 19:53.300
Chuck: think about it-- this is a desert island, morgan.

19:53.300 --> 19:55.500
Mayonnaise simply doesn't fare well in the tropics--

19:55.500 --> 19:57.380
Morgan: oh, yeah, but define sandwich.

19:57.380 --> 19:59.770
'Cause technically you can put anything
between two slices of bread.

19:59.770 --> 20:01.620
For instance, could i bring...

20:01.970 --> 20:03.990
A jessica alba sandwich to said desert island?

20:03.990 --> 20:05.160
Chuck: i-i suppose.

20:06.210 --> 20:08.500
Well, i'll have you know,
i stand by my mayonnaise theory.

20:08.500 --> 20:11.410
And you're still a giant douche for
spying on me like that.

20:11.410 --> 20:15.060
Well, if it's any comfort, chuck,
we planted those bugs to protect you.

20:16.160 --> 20:17.580
How did you find the surveillance,anyway?

20:17.580 --> 20:19.700
Oh,a little birdie named lazslo told me.
What?

20:19.700 --> 20:21.730
You contacted lazslo and didn't tell me?

20:21.730 --> 20:22.900
I'm sorry,casey.

20:22.900 --> 20:25.100
Did i violate your trust?

20:36.940 --> 20:38.960
Willkommen to wienerlicious.

20:38.960 --> 20:43.180
I'm sorry,but we're geschlossen--
and that's german for "closed.

20:45.550 --> 20:46.720
" that's really adorable.

20:46.720 --> 20:47.890
Nice cover,agent walker.

20:47.890 --> 20:48.860
You ve a sec?

20:54.620 --> 20:55.480
Hello,chuck.

20:58.630 --> 20:59.510
What did you tell your handler?

20:59.510 --> 21:00.690
I told him you were innocent,okay?

21:00.690 --> 21:01.650
I told him,i thought you were innocent.

21:01.650 --> 21:03.780
And i think the best thing for
you to do is go and turn yourself in.

21:03.780 --> 21:04.500
They can help you.

21:04.500 --> 21:05.860
Forget it,chuck.

21:06.610 --> 21:07.470
It doesn't even matter.

21:07.470 --> 21:08.380
Of course it matters.

21:08.380 --> 21:09.350
Isn't this what you wanted?

21:09.350 --> 21:11.670
They went through the trouble of framing me for murder.

21:11.970 --> 21:13.450
What's going to happen when they get me back?

21:13.450 --> 21:14.430
A slap on the wrist?

21:14.650 --> 21:16.150
There's got to be someplace you can hide me.

21:17.600 --> 21:18.610
Just for tonight.

21:20.390 --> 21:21.630
There is one place.

21:22.940 --> 21:24.550
So this kid just escaped?

21:24.780 --> 21:28.260
Look,we tried everything we could to
prevent this whole thing from happening.

21:28.260 --> 21:30.140
And what exactly is this?

21:30.140 --> 21:34.630
A mentally unstable weapons designer,off his meds,
and currently running around los angeles.

21:34.630 --> 21:35.740
And how do you know all this?

21:35.740 --> 21:37.140
Lazslo was my asset.

21:37.800 --> 21:38.800
I was the one who found him.

21:38.800 --> 21:41.620
I was the one who trained him,and i'm definitely
the one who's going to be bringing him back.

21:41.620 --> 21:44.460
Look,i'm just going to be
completely straight with you,walker.

21:45.140 --> 21:47.840
We believe that he is looking to make a bomb.

21:48.740 --> 21:51.690
And god help whoever's in his way
when lazslo decides to go off.

21:52.970 --> 21:54.150
Welcome to buy more.

21:54.150 --> 21:55.920
**

22:00.130 --> 22:01.430
this is greate!

22:03.310 --> 22:04.370
I'll be out before you guys open.

22:04.370 --> 22:07.810
And if everything works out,
you will never see me again.

22:07.810 --> 22:10.150
Thank you,chuck,for everything.

22:10.380 --> 22:11.470
I really appreciate it.

22:11.470 --> 22:12.540
Yeah,definitely.

22:12.540 --> 22:14.710
Good luck disappearing,lazslo.

22:14.710 --> 22:15.650
Yeah.

22:15.650 --> 22:18.280
Oh,and i hope you don't mind,
i kind of helped myself to the...

22:18.790 --> 22:20.300
To the bond ouevre.

22:20.300 --> 22:22.020
Oh,check you out.

22:22.020 --> 22:23.380
A view to a kill?

22:23.380 --> 22:25.850
That's a bold choice.
Why?Is it a good one?

22:25.850 --> 22:28.920
Oh,dude,christopher walken
playing some evil nazi villain?

22:28.920 --> 22:32.470
Grace jones as some a 'roid rage sex assassin?

22:32.470 --> 22:34.710
I think,actually,on second thought,
i'm going to stay for the beginning.

22:34.710 --> 22:35.800
Sit.

22:40.390 --> 22:41.230
Who is it?

22:42.640 --> 22:44.740
Uh,it's my handler,sarah.

22:44.740 --> 22:45.910
Chuck,you got to turn it off.

22:46.600 --> 22:48.530
Please,chuck,she could be tracking us.

22:48.720 --> 22:51.440
You don't understand.If you turn me in to your handlers,
it's like signing my death warrant.

22:55.820 --> 22:56.630
Give me your watch.

22:56.970 --> 22:57.920
Why?
Give me your watch.

22:57.920 --> 22:59.410
I need to disable the transponder.

22:59.770 --> 23:01.430
Disable the transponder?
transponder

23:01.530 --> 23:03.320
Yeah,but how would you do that?

23:11.510 --> 23:12.440
Here you go.

23:17.870 --> 23:19.150
You were right about the bugs,by the way.

23:19.150 --> 23:20.480
God knows what they put in my car.

23:20.480 --> 23:21.680
I've got a pretty good idea.

23:22.200 --> 23:24.560
I broke into it earlier,disabled the gps system.

23:24.950 --> 23:25.770
How did you...

23:27.160 --> 23:28.150
You designed my car.

23:28.150 --> 23:29.140
Just think,chuck.

23:29.880 --> 23:33.770
Right now,there is no one in the
entire world who knows where we are.

23:38.400 --> 23:39.860
come on,chuck.Pick up the phone.

23:40.480 --> 23:41.170
Hey,it's chuck.

23:41.170 --> 23:42.200
I'll call you right back.

23:42.470 --> 23:43.270
damn it.

23:43.420 --> 23:47.030
Chuck,i want you to go to your car,
lock the doors and wait for me.

23:51.070 --> 23:51.980
What did i tell you?

23:52.220 --> 23:55.290
Max zorin is one of the greatest bad guys of all time.

23:57.850 --> 23:59.460
You think walken was the bad guy?

24:00.990 --> 24:02.180
What,are you kidding?

24:02.180 --> 24:04.850
I mean,he did try to sink california into the pacific ocean.

24:04.850 --> 24:05.870
What do you think?

24:06.540 --> 24:08.000
Don't you get it,chuck?

24:08.510 --> 24:09.680
Zorin is like us.

24:09.680 --> 24:14.250
The nazis used him for his superior gifts
the way our government uses me and you.

24:15.040 --> 24:17.380
I don't...
Too bad zorin didn't have this home theater system.

24:17.380 --> 24:18.970
Screw flooding silicon valley.

24:18.970 --> 24:21.210
Do you know what we can do with this system
if we really wanted to,chuck?

24:23.140 --> 24:24.340
Watch more movies?

24:24.480 --> 24:26.870
I haven't had a chance to play with
this bad boy since i designed it.

24:33.020 --> 24:35.260
What is that?
Strategic air command.

24:35.770 --> 24:39.850
We keep a fleet of b-2s in guam,
kept on nuclear alert,just in case.

24:43.360 --> 24:44.210
What are you doing?

24:44.210 --> 24:46.040
Putting my tax dollars to work,chuck.

24:46.690 --> 24:49.090
Would you like to play a nice game of thermonuclear war?

24:49.820 --> 24:50.960
What about texas?

24:51.560 --> 24:53.450
What did texas ever do that was so great?

24:56.560 --> 24:57.550
Nine hours...

24:58.280 --> 24:59.690
Maybe we should pick somewhere closer?

25:00.700 --> 25:01.950
In honor of max zorin...

25:02.870 --> 25:04.630
Let's see how fast they get to san francisco.

25:07.390 --> 25:08.730
Hey,hey,hey!

25:08.730 --> 25:09.940
Um...

25:09.940 --> 25:12.280
What about,let's watch goldfinger,huh?

25:14.290 --> 25:15.050
What's it about?

25:15.050 --> 25:20.490
Uh,again,it's about this bad,misunderstood guy
who just wants to blow up the world.

25:20.490 --> 25:22.590
It's right up your alley;
i think you'll really like it.

25:26.190 --> 25:27.220
We can always play later.

25:27.220 --> 25:28.090
We can!

25:28.270 --> 25:29.380
We can play...

25:29.780 --> 25:31.680
Bomb,bomb,bomb...

25:32.590 --> 25:33.190
Thing later...

25:33.190 --> 25:34.870
I'm going to go get us some more popcorn.

25:34.870 --> 25:36.010
So,here,why don't you...

25:36.010 --> 25:37.280
You go ahead and start without me.

25:37.280 --> 25:39.800
And-and,uh,i'm going to be right back.

25:41.430 --> 25:44.030
You have 34 new messages.

25:44.030 --> 25:44.990
Chuck,it's casey.

25:44.990 --> 25:45.830
Call me.

25:47.070 --> 25:48.410
You think this is funny,chuck?

25:49.460 --> 25:51.720
If you don't call me back in the next ten seconds...

25:52.170 --> 25:54.720
Tie it in a knot and shove it straight up...

25:54.720 --> 25:58.270
chuck,i want you to go to your car,
lock the doors,and wait for me.

26:05.890 --> 26:06.690
Where are we headed?

26:07.020 --> 26:08.670
I thought i asked you to turn your phone off.

26:08.670 --> 26:09.530
Who were you talking to?

26:09.530 --> 26:10.640
My handler,okay?

26:10.640 --> 26:12.290
She was just checking in.

26:12.290 --> 26:13.280
You shouldn't have done that,chuck.

26:13.280 --> 26:15.120
You should not have dragged them into this.

26:15.120 --> 26:16.880
I'm not responsible for what happens now.

26:19.410 --> 26:20.790
You sold me out...
You sold me out!

26:20.790 --> 26:23.120
No,no,no,no.
I just didn't want you to get hurt,okay?

26:23.720 --> 26:24.370
Look,relax.

26:24.370 --> 26:26.230
Just relax,everything is going to be cool.

26:41.850 --> 26:43.700
Everything is not going to be cool.

26:56.210 --> 26:57.570
What the hell?

27:18.850 --> 27:20.990
You're going to kill us!
You're going to kill us!

27:38.810 --> 27:41.210
Well,chuck,it's been fun.

27:45.820 --> 27:46.610
Don't...

27:48.660 --> 27:50.010
Oh...Oh!

28:22.050 --> 28:22.990
Hey.

28:23.480 --> 28:24.580
You look nice.

28:24.910 --> 28:25.870
Thanks.

28:25.870 --> 28:27.060
I feel like crap.

28:27.750 --> 28:28.650
I screwed up.

28:29.300 --> 28:32.320
I severely pooched the lazslo situation last night.

28:32.780 --> 28:33.950
Yeah,well...

28:34.120 --> 28:36.650
Today,you have a job interview.

28:37.750 --> 28:41.360
Do you think i care about making
lower management at a buy more?

28:41.360 --> 28:42.080
Are you kidding me?

28:42.080 --> 28:46.040
I aided and abetted the escape of
the next ted kacyzski,sarah.

28:46.040 --> 28:46.870
I just...

28:48.030 --> 28:51.410
I can't believe that i was so wrong about that guy.

28:51.720 --> 28:52.980
No wonder you bugged my room.

28:52.980 --> 28:54.350
I'm an absolute idiot.

28:59.570 --> 29:03.440
You know,just because you trust people,
it doesn't make you an idiot.

29:04.220 --> 29:06.400
Yeah,well,i should've trusted you guys a little more.

29:09.970 --> 29:10.890
I'm sorry.

29:12.510 --> 29:16.220
Well,casey got a signal on your car,
and somehow the gps got turned back on

29:16.220 --> 29:18.080
and lazslo was heading east.

29:18.370 --> 29:19.650
So,i'll call you from the road.

29:19.650 --> 29:21.870
And don't worry,we're going to bring him in,chuck.

29:23.480 --> 29:24.700
Good luck today.

29:43.520 --> 29:45.250
Morgan!

29:45.250 --> 29:49.240
I don't know who you're supposed to be,
but that's the most kick-ass costume ever.

29:49.450 --> 29:50.280
I'm sorry,michael.

29:50.280 --> 29:51.590
Is it halloween?

29:52.330 --> 29:53.400
I didn't realize.

29:56.280 --> 29:57.330
Morgan,hey.

29:57.720 --> 30:01.210
You up for a little mystery crisper holiday edition?

30:01.440 --> 30:04.570
I'm sure i have no idea what you're talking about,lester.

30:05.180 --> 30:06.020
Jeffrey.

30:08.250 --> 30:10.050
Hey,morgan,buddy,where were you this morning?

30:10.050 --> 30:11.280
I thought you wanted a ride in.

30:12.170 --> 30:13.210
Why are you all dressed up?

30:13.210 --> 30:14.640
Why are you all dressed up?

30:14.970 --> 30:16.560
I have a job interview today.

30:16.750 --> 30:18.980
Bully for you,chuck.
What?

30:18.980 --> 30:22.170
You think you're the only one at the
buy more who cares about looking professional?

30:24.150 --> 30:25.210
Typical.

30:25.950 --> 30:27.530
I never,i never said anything...

30:33.720 --> 30:34.650
Boo!
Aah!

30:35.020 --> 30:36.310
Did i scare you,chuck?

30:36.310 --> 30:41.400
You better be scared,'cause i'm about
ready to kill me a job interview,partner.

30:42.220 --> 30:43.400
Ka-pow!

31:07.480 --> 31:08.830
Lazslo is not headed east.

31:08.830 --> 31:10.210
He's going to the santa monica pier.

31:10.210 --> 31:11.410
Yeah,you don't say?

31:11.520 --> 31:13.420
We just found the gps in downtown.

31:13.680 --> 31:15.630
Lazslo ripped it out and stuck it under a big rig.

31:15.630 --> 31:17.090
Look,he was casing the arcade.

31:17.090 --> 31:18.440
It's where he was first recruited.

31:18.440 --> 31:20.180
There's a huge halloween party there every year.

31:20.180 --> 31:20.940
I think he's going to blow it up.

31:20.940 --> 31:22.480
Where do you think you're going?

31:22.840 --> 31:24.210
Um...It's you.

31:24.210 --> 31:25.910
Hey,hey,big mike,i...

31:25.910 --> 31:27.520
Can i...Can i borrow another herder?

31:27.520 --> 31:28.210
All the herders are out.

31:28.210 --> 31:30.220
You've got an interview this afternoon,or did you forget?
No.

31:30.220 --> 31:31.450
I-i just...I'm...

31:31.650 --> 31:32.510
Something came up.

31:32.510 --> 31:34.590
Is that something more important
than being assistant manager?

31:34.890 --> 31:37.340
Is it more important than
handing over your promotion to tang?

31:37.340 --> 31:40.010
Please,chuck.Is it more important
than big mike's relaxation?

31:40.190 --> 31:43.340
Look,big mike,there are just some things
in life that are more important than the buy more.

31:46.760 --> 31:48.460
You mean,like fishing and danish?

31:56.120 --> 31:57.550
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

31:57.550 --> 31:58.320
**

32:05.140 --> 32:06.330
Bartowski?

32:08.570 --> 32:11.170
Excuse me,you-you in the gordon gecko costume.

32:11.460 --> 32:12.990
Have you seen chuck bartowski?

32:12.990 --> 32:14.110
It's time for his interview.

32:14.110 --> 32:16.820
I actually don't know where chuck's
been keeping himself these days.

32:17.240 --> 32:18.340
So-sorry.

32:21.400 --> 32:24.050
I guess your boyfriend just couldn't take the heat,huh?

32:25.770 --> 32:27.690
I'm sure he's got a perfectly good excuse.

32:27.690 --> 32:28.650
Sure he does.

32:30.060 --> 32:33.370
First chuck bails on you and
your stupid space-penis costume.

32:33.510 --> 32:36.770
And then,he doesn't even have
the stones to show up for his interview.

32:36.770 --> 32:37.650
What a loser.

32:38.060 --> 32:39.510
Even by your standards.

32:39.780 --> 32:45.350
If i were you,i'd start interviewing
for a new best friend,ma-ma-ma...

32:45.350 --> 32:46.530
Morgan.

32:46.760 --> 32:47.810
Let me ask you something.

32:48.260 --> 32:50.120
What do you know about chuck bartowski?

32:57.540 --> 32:58.730
You're not bartowski.

32:58.730 --> 33:01.440
Actually,i'm-i'm here to interview on my friend's behalf.

33:01.440 --> 33:02.050
Look...

33:02.050 --> 33:03.590
Please,please,just hear me out,okay?

33:03.590 --> 33:06.220
I know that the virtues that make for
a good buy more manager are the same virtues

33:06.220 --> 33:07.610
that make for a best friend.

33:07.610 --> 33:11.900
Now,uh,chuck and i may have our differences,
but i can tell yo5 this about him.

33:12.140 --> 33:13.920
Chuck is-is brave.

33:14.640 --> 33:15.900
Chuck is loyal.

33:15.900 --> 33:18.300
You know,chuck can quote wrath of khan word-for-word.

33:18.300 --> 33:19.870
And chuck is courageous.

33:19.970 --> 33:24.770
Chuck's got a wicked vinyl collection,
and chuck has the wisdom to not eat garbage

33:24.770 --> 33:26.380
from the break room Crisper.

33:27.470 --> 33:32.520
If you want my open and honest and direct opinion,
the best man for this job

33:32.690 --> 33:34.590
is a man by the name of chuck Bartowski.

33:39.760 --> 33:40.930
Some speech.

33:41.360 --> 33:43.900
Chuck bartowski sounds like a hell of a guy.

33:43.900 --> 33:44.730
He is.

33:44.730 --> 33:48.730
When he comes in tomorrow,
he'll be working for one...

33:48.730 --> 33:50.710
Harold tiberius tang.

33:51.180 --> 33:52.370
God help you all.

34:10.010 --> 34:12.570
i meant to tell you earlier about
your car's self-destruct function.

34:14.310 --> 34:15.760
One of my more inspired designs.

34:15.760 --> 34:17.130
Lazslo,listen.

34:17.130 --> 34:18.210
Relax,chuck.

34:18.550 --> 34:19.449
She's all yours.

34:27.449 --> 34:28.239
What did you just do?

34:28.239 --> 34:29.820
You just armed a bomb.

34:30.400 --> 34:32.880
That would have taken me hours to
get through the fingerprint recognition system.

34:33.239 --> 34:34.420
Why are you doing this?
What?

34:34.420 --> 34:35.199
Blowing stuff up?

34:35.199 --> 34:36.830
That's what bad guys do,chuck.

34:36.830 --> 34:40.090
Besides,how else was i going to punish
them for what they did to me?

34:43.389 --> 34:46.440
Yeah?
Hey,someone just armed the herder to sedf-destruct.

34:46.440 --> 34:48.300
Yeah.I know.

34:48.889 --> 34:49.710
It was me.

34:51.570 --> 34:52.630
Disarm the bomb right now!

34:52.630 --> 34:53.310
You disarm the bomb!

34:53.310 --> 34:54.420
How?

34:55.770 --> 34:56.670
Cut the wire.

34:58.750 --> 35:00.030
which one?
The red one.

35:02.380 --> 35:03.110
You got to cut a wire,chuck!

35:03.110 --> 35:04.560
What if i cut both of them?

35:04.560 --> 35:06.190
Oh,like sean connery in the end of goldfinger?

35:07.210 --> 35:08.110
What did you just say?

35:08.290 --> 35:09.120
Cut the wire,chuck.

35:09.120 --> 35:11.590
The other night,you said
you'd never seen goldfinger,so,

35:11.590 --> 35:13.210
how would you know what bond
does at the end of The movie?

35:13.210 --> 35:15.240
Cut the wire,or we're dead.

35:16.480 --> 35:17.800
You lied to me,lazslo.

35:17.930 --> 35:22.380
You knew i'd believe you when
you said you just wanted to live a normal,peaceful life.

35:23.620 --> 35:26.570
And you knew that i'd believe you about
cudting the wire,but you were wrong,lazslo.

35:26.570 --> 35:28.110
Chuck!
Wait!Wait!Stay back!

35:28.110 --> 35:29.410
Cut the red wire,chuck!

35:39.220 --> 35:40.350
you're under arrest.

35:44.040 --> 35:44.950
Come on.

35:56.620 --> 35:57.860
i liked it a little bit,all right?

35:57.860 --> 35:59.510
All right,now,how do i...

36:01.730 --> 36:02.800
hey,chuck.

36:08.150 --> 36:10.280
Nice costume,chuck.

36:10.510 --> 36:13.370
And what are you supposed to be?

36:13.370 --> 36:15.350
Oh,that's right.

36:15.670 --> 36:17.480
You're my employee.

36:19.840 --> 36:21.550
Aren't you going to congratulate me?

36:21.550 --> 36:23.390
You did hear i got the job.

36:23.390 --> 36:25.370
Uncontested.
Yeah.

36:25.370 --> 36:26.580
Nice work,harry.

36:27.490 --> 36:32.420
Anyhow,now that you're here,
i wanted to talk to you about some organizational ideas

36:32.420 --> 36:34.180
i had for the nerd Herd...

36:35.340 --> 36:36.480
Chuck,where are you going?

36:37.170 --> 36:38.150
Chuck?

36:38.150 --> 36:39.650
Chuck,i will not be ignored!

36:40.040 --> 36:41.000
Did morgan ever find you?

36:41.000 --> 36:42.690
I thought the guy was going to lose it.

36:42.690 --> 36:43.430
No.I-i know.

36:43.430 --> 36:46.670
He was really looking forward to
the buy more costume contest.

36:46.670 --> 36:48.800
I'm talking about what he did for you.

36:50.110 --> 36:53.960
Giving the whole big speech to try to
talk the hr guy into giving you the job?

36:55.970 --> 36:57.190
Morgan did that?

36:57.190 --> 36:59.680
And then someone went and stole his bike.

36:59.680 --> 37:02.280
I mean,what kind of loser would steal a guy's bike?

37:08.950 --> 37:09.820
Look at you two.

38:05.070 --> 38:06.200
I didn't think you were coming.

38:06.430 --> 38:07.250
I'm sorry.

38:07.250 --> 38:08.470
I got held up.

38:09.330 --> 38:11.740
Listen,morgan,i think you should be the head this year.

38:14.000 --> 38:14.870
Really?

38:26.320 --> 38:27.990
chuck?Chuck,honey?Honey?

38:27.990 --> 38:29.130
he's in the back.
