Olivia Dunham.
Charlie Francis. FBI.

00:03.034 --> 00:04.524
ANNOUNCER:
Previously on <i>Fringe...</i>

00:04.572 --> 00:05.234
Unh!

00:06.185 --> 00:07.354
BROYLES:
<i>You had no choice.</i>

00:07.487 --> 00:09.782
Whatever that thing was,
it wasn't Charlie.

00:12.258 --> 00:14.119
NINA: <i>You've been through</i>
<i>quite an ordeal.</i>

00:14.190 --> 00:14.959
<i>What's this?</i>

00:14.960 --> 00:17.563
<i>Sam Weiss--the man who helped</i>
<i>put me back together.</i>

00:17.598 --> 00:19.593
You can take the shoes
off now, we're done.

00:19.628 --> 00:21.523
- I just got here.
- Come back tomorrow.

00:21.558 --> 00:23.849
By then, I'll have found you
the perfect bowling ball.

00:23.884 --> 00:25.794
I was told that
you could fix me.

00:28.184 --> 00:29.700
Take care, Agent Dunham.

00:35.091 --> 00:37.221
[pop music playing faintly
on jukebox]

00:37.421 --> 00:38.447
We're closed.

00:42.550 --> 00:44.229
I think I owe you
a thank you.

00:44.952 --> 00:47.681
I got my memories back
from the accident,

00:47.922 --> 00:48.880
so...

00:50.391 --> 00:52.061
I figured I wouldn't be
needing these.

00:58.465 --> 00:59.529
Who died?

01:01.810 --> 01:02.901
You and your partner,
Charlie,

01:02.936 --> 01:04.055
were pretty close, huh?

01:07.241 --> 01:08.324
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:08.608 --> 01:10.209
I guess getting
your memory back

01:10.210 --> 01:11.385
wasn't your only problem.

01:12.045 --> 01:14.236
Oh, of course
I have problems, but...

01:15.816 --> 01:17.549
The problems I have
I can handle.

01:19.496 --> 01:20.996
Sure you can.

01:31.064 --> 01:32.731
<i>what you need right now,</i>
<i>Agent Dunham,</i>

01:32.732 --> 01:33.866
<i>is something to help you</i>

01:33.901 --> 01:35.390
<i>with everything</i>
<i>you've been going through...</i>

01:40.219 --> 01:41.462
Something to help you...

01:42.241 --> 01:43.630
make sense of it all.

01:46.178 --> 01:47.378
Like bowling.

01:47.679 --> 01:49.816
Well, what do you know?
She makes a joke.

01:51.450 --> 01:53.864
No, I got
another project for you.

01:54.753 --> 01:56.087
Uh, yes, like bowling.

01:56.088 --> 01:57.722
You're gonna think
I'm full of it,

01:57.723 --> 01:59.651
but here's
the thing, Olivia...

02:01.272 --> 02:02.814
Whether you admit it
or not,

02:03.948 --> 02:05.896
your life is something
of a nightmare.

02:09.030 --> 02:11.611
<i>I hope you don't have anything</i>
<i>against the color red.</i>

02:18.293 --> 02:19.408
[elevator bell dings]

02:32.192 --> 02:35.127
[distant phones ringing]

02:37.978 --> 02:40.831
<i>Jeez, Greg. Carl's really</i>
<i>pissed off at you.</i>

02:40.866 --> 02:42.065
What, uh--
what'd you do, man?

02:42.175 --> 02:43.756
- <i>You better get in there.</i>
- I'm going.

02:58.385 --> 03:00.259
[distorted voices]

03:02.456 --> 03:03.672
Finally.
We've been waiting.

03:03.972 --> 03:04.894
Are you okay?

03:06.316 --> 03:09.295
Whatever happened, make sure
we all go away.

03:10.869 --> 03:12.741
You know how much
trouble you caused me.

03:13.949 --> 03:16.253
I am going
to destroy you!

03:17.138 --> 03:18.198
What the hell?

03:19.741 --> 03:21.175
[grunting]

03:24.731 --> 03:25.905
Greg, are you crazy?

03:26.314 --> 03:27.381
[grunting]

03:45.574 --> 03:49.176
"Dream Logic"

04:02.949 --> 04:04.573
You can bring that
in here, please.

04:04.718 --> 04:05.384
Hang on.

04:05.986 --> 04:08.392
Walter,
what are you doing?

04:08.722 --> 04:09.870
Making my bed.

04:10.324 --> 04:13.016
I've got a fireplace
to keep me warm,

04:13.359 --> 04:14.750
and if I get hungry
in the middle of the night,

04:14.840 --> 04:18.022
the kitchen is only
13 steps away,

04:18.031 --> 04:19.220
which is a prime number

04:19.321 --> 04:20.803
and a sign
of good fortune.

04:21.267 --> 04:22.915
You know that
you have a bedroom, right?

04:23.237 --> 04:23.738
<i>Upstairs.</i>

04:24.367 --> 04:26.033
Oh, I know
what you're thinking.

04:26.306 --> 04:27.347
Don't worry, son.

04:27.497 --> 04:29.341
I promise to wear
my shorts to bed

04:29.376 --> 04:31.521
so that if you bring
any young ladies home,

04:31.556 --> 04:33.458
there won't be
any embarrassing moments.

04:33.537 --> 04:34.704
Knock, knock.

04:35.040 --> 04:36.748
<i>Agent Farnsworth.</i>

04:36.783 --> 04:38.354
Welcome to our new home.

04:38.389 --> 04:38.909
Thank you.

04:39.350 --> 04:41.941
Oh.
Oh, housewarming.

04:42.347 --> 04:43.647
I love presents.

04:45.343 --> 04:45.945
Hey.

04:45.980 --> 04:47.832
- Oh.
- Walter, come on.

04:48.613 --> 04:50.288
Italian ciabatta bread.

04:50.323 --> 04:52.136
- Very impressive, Walter.
- Yes!

04:53.162 --> 04:54.443
It's for good luck.

04:55.627 --> 04:57.512
I brought something
for you too.

04:57.547 --> 04:58.605
Oh, you shouldn't have.

04:58.917 --> 05:00.459
Agent Dunham
sent this over.

05:01.399 --> 05:04.104
A man kills his boss,
he doesn't remember,

05:04.139 --> 05:07.016
<i>and then he has this really</i>
<i>crazy thing with his eyes.</i>

05:09.065 --> 05:10.831
This says there's
video surveillance.

05:11.578 --> 05:12.524
<i>I saw it.</i>

05:12.930 --> 05:14.438
Whatever was happening
to that man,

05:14.473 --> 05:15.583
it wasn't normal.

05:16.286 --> 05:17.685
Do I eat it or keep it?

05:18.164 --> 05:19.876
I suppose
whichever you'd like.

05:21.773 --> 05:23.098
Pack a bag, Walter.

05:24.460 --> 05:25.489
We're going to Seattle.

05:44.032 --> 05:44.885
PETER:
<i>Thank you.</i>

05:47.455 --> 05:48.210
There you go.

05:50.797 --> 05:51.787
Do you have a card?

05:52.309 --> 05:54.122
In case we need a ride
while we're in town.

05:54.994 --> 05:55.890
Thank you.

05:59.170 --> 06:00.259
MAN:
Thanks for coming out.

06:00.393 --> 06:03.130
We brought Mr. Leader here
around 6:00 last night.

06:03.812 --> 06:05.339
We haven't managed to get
anything out of him.

06:05.898 --> 06:07.259
He hasn't been
cooperative?

06:07.294 --> 06:08.549
He hasn't been
responsive.

06:08.900 --> 06:10.114
We only just managed
to wake him up.

06:10.681 --> 06:11.008
Wait.

06:12.353 --> 06:13.710
He's been asleep
for 16 hours?

06:13.745 --> 06:14.941
Like he
was drugged.

06:15.373 --> 06:17.466
The doctors only managed to wake
him up a few minutes ago.

06:18.741 --> 06:20.872
[ominous music]

06:25.603 --> 06:28.350
Peter, I-I don't want
to go in there.

06:28.963 --> 06:30.529
I'd rather
stay out here.

06:33.361 --> 06:34.146
Sure.

06:35.025 --> 06:37.045
OLIVIA: Can you tell us
what happened, Mr. Leader?

06:37.260 --> 06:38.374
It doesn't make sense.

06:41.031 --> 06:43.139
I remember driving
to work from lunch,

06:43.934 --> 06:45.153
pulling into the garage,

06:46.737 --> 06:49.710
and then I was on the floor
in Carl Langdon's office.

06:50.507 --> 06:52.089
They were
holding me down.

06:54.195 --> 06:55.777
And there's nothing else

06:55.812 --> 06:57.441
that you remember
from yesterday?

06:58.124 --> 06:59.325
Nothing unusual?

07:00.531 --> 07:01.969
You're gonna think
I'm crazy.

07:02.385 --> 07:03.269
Try me.

07:05.655 --> 07:06.670
The office...

07:08.264 --> 07:09.382
It was like the office

07:09.417 --> 07:11.772
was infiltrated
by these creatures.

07:12.436 --> 07:14.148
And Carl,
he was their leader.

07:14.964 --> 07:16.617
<i>He had horns...</i>

07:17.733 --> 07:19.127
<i>like some demon.</i>

07:19.435 --> 07:21.706
I know.
It sounds nuts.

07:23.005 --> 07:24.660
Almost like
I'm dreaming,

07:24.750 --> 07:26.413
or like it was...

07:26.743 --> 07:28.849
[breathing heavily]

07:30.848 --> 07:31.612
Mr. Leader?

07:33.242 --> 07:34.615
- Mr. Leader?
- Walter!

07:40.223 --> 07:40.995
<i>What is it?</i>

07:44.108 --> 07:44.672
WOMAN: <i>Greg!</i>

07:44.673 --> 07:45.673
MAN: <i>You can't go</i>
<i>in the room, Mrs. Leader.</i>

07:45.674 --> 07:46.746
<i>What's happening to him?</i>

07:47.466 --> 07:49.248
- <i>Greg!</i>
- <i>Mrs. Leader. Please!</i>

07:50.202 --> 07:51.669
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

07:51.670 --> 07:52.645
No, Greg!

07:52.905 --> 07:54.119
No! No!

08:00.772 --> 08:01.489
WALTER: That's odd.

08:02.340 --> 08:03.354
Warm.

08:04.592 --> 08:06.158
He should be cooler
by now.

08:08.363 --> 08:09.239
The oven--

08:09.825 --> 08:11.732
Peter, I think we forgot
to turn it off at home.

08:12.543 --> 08:14.173
Walter, we've never
even turned it on.

08:14.208 --> 08:14.944
You sure?

08:15.137 --> 08:17.072
Walter, we never
turned the oven on.

08:17.121 --> 08:19.527
We did not leave
the front door unlocked,

08:19.562 --> 08:21.348
and the toaster is not
gonna burn the house down.

08:21.438 --> 08:22.284
What's going on
with you, Walter?

08:22.319 --> 08:23.617
<i>You've been acting weird</i>
<i>ever since we got here.</i>

08:23.687 --> 08:25.358
Apologies, we're still waiting
on the tox screen.

08:25.438 --> 08:27.210
But the blood CBC
is, uh--

08:27.321 --> 08:28.687
Severe thyroxine deficit,

08:28.722 --> 08:31.547
curiously high levels
of adrenal hormones.

08:32.188 --> 08:32.894
How did you know that?

08:34.048 --> 08:36.825
Shock-induced
achromotrichia,

08:37.216 --> 08:39.392
hyperkeratotic
skin lesions,

08:39.427 --> 08:41.190
and clear signs
of dehydration.

08:41.225 --> 08:43.496
It seems that this man
died of--

08:44.091 --> 08:45.490
Of acute exhaustion.

08:45.525 --> 08:46.725
That doesn't make
any sense.

08:46.760 --> 08:49.421
- Human beings can't die of--
- Not that we're aware of, no.

08:50.247 --> 08:52.026
It has been documented
in rats.

08:54.052 --> 08:57.202
I need this body
taken back to my lab.

08:57.237 --> 08:57.804
Your lab?

08:58.366 --> 09:00.920
- In Boston, Massachusetts.
- Walter, whatever you need,

09:00.980 --> 09:02.068
I'm sure
they have it here.

09:02.439 --> 09:03.753
Would you excuse me,
Doctor?

09:05.967 --> 09:08.219
Peter,
I-I need to go home.

09:09.028 --> 09:10.007
I don't like it here.

09:10.058 --> 09:12.323
- Walter.
- This city has a smell.

09:12.407 --> 09:13.709
- Walter.
- It's wet!

09:14.562 --> 09:16.721
It reminds me
of St. Claire's,

09:17.313 --> 09:19.781
the mental institution
where I lived.

09:20.176 --> 09:23.025
Peter,
I want to go home.

09:24.020 --> 09:26.889
You stay.
Help Agent Dunham, but--

09:27.253 --> 09:28.557
Okay.

09:29.928 --> 09:31.856
We'll find someone
to take you home.

09:33.426 --> 09:34.065
Thank you.

09:36.265 --> 09:37.213
Seems pretty harmless.

09:38.667 --> 09:39.902
Looks can be deceiving.

09:40.354 --> 09:42.225
Buddy, I've been with
the bureau for three years.

09:42.538 --> 09:44.417
Flying your father home
shouldn't be a problem.

09:44.664 --> 09:45.667
Right.

09:45.774 --> 09:47.784
You'll want to keep
his Sudoku pad handy.

09:47.819 --> 09:48.744
There's also a copy

09:48.779 --> 09:50.611
of Max Planck's book on entropy
in his backpack.

09:50.612 --> 09:52.013
That should keep him busy
for a couple hours.

09:52.073 --> 09:54.297
And whatever you do, under
no circumstances let him drink.

09:54.518 --> 09:55.590
Bit of a tippler, huh?

09:55.684 --> 09:57.206
No, at any given time,
there's a good chance

09:57.236 --> 09:58.742
there's about a half dozen
psychotropic drugs

09:58.782 --> 10:01.401
in his system, so drinking--
It's not a good idea.

10:02.891 --> 10:03.705
Thank you, Doctor.

10:04.392 --> 10:06.625
You know, I really
appreciate your cooperation.

10:06.861 --> 10:07.719
Yeah, no problem.

10:08.905 --> 10:10.213
Do you have
a business card?

10:11.399 --> 10:14.280
So that I-I can send you
a copy of the results.

10:15.115 --> 10:15.817
Uh, of course.

10:19.279 --> 10:19.641
Thank you.

10:19.692 --> 10:20.959
<i>[Walter groaning]</i>

10:20.994 --> 10:21.733
<i>No!</i>

10:21.985 --> 10:24.834
You can't put the body
in feet first.

10:25.114 --> 10:26.904
Lunatics.
Out, out.

10:27.595 --> 10:28.598
You think he'll be
all right?

10:31.921 --> 10:34.422
Walter,
or Agent Cashner?

10:38.594 --> 10:40.854
MRS LEADER: Greg used to call me
every day after lunch.

10:41.635 --> 10:43.727
When he didn't call,
I knew something was wrong.

10:44.032 --> 10:45.074
But there'd...

10:46.101 --> 10:48.835
There'd been no change
in his behavior recently?

10:50.741 --> 10:52.740
He was a little more tired
than usual,

10:52.841 --> 10:54.840
but he'd been
working a lot.

10:54.977 --> 10:56.577
But no illnesses?

10:56.946 --> 10:58.803
<i>No hallucinations?</i>

10:58.881 --> 11:00.720
No, not at all.

11:01.713 --> 11:02.929
I can't believe
he's gone.

11:04.263 --> 11:05.236
Mrs. Leader...

11:06.522 --> 11:07.985
Did your husband
have any sleep issues?

11:08.758 --> 11:11.407
These books--
<i>Guide to Sleep Disorders,</i>

11:11.561 --> 11:12.693
<i>Understanding Sleep...</i>

11:14.897 --> 11:16.655
He used to sleepwalk.

11:18.111 --> 11:20.073
<i>Sometimes he'd wake up</i>
<i>in the kitchen</i>

11:20.108 --> 11:21.068
having cooked a whole meal.

11:23.347 --> 11:24.619
Was he ever violent?

11:24.773 --> 11:27.318
No, never.

11:27.910 --> 11:29.395
And he was cured.

11:30.264 --> 11:31.447
He had seen
a few specialists.

11:31.518 --> 11:33.647
He hadn't had an episode
in six months.

11:34.084 --> 11:36.132
Uh, we'll need the names
of those doctors.

11:36.167 --> 11:38.069
And did he by any chance
keep a sleep journal?

11:40.122 --> 11:42.903
Yeah.
Would you like to see it?

11:43.585 --> 11:45.038
Yes. Please.

11:48.075 --> 11:49.220
WALTER:
Just in time, dear.

11:49.255 --> 11:51.810
Help me with this
infernal body bag.

11:51.845 --> 11:52.640
This is
Agent Cashner.

11:52.675 --> 11:53.984
Walter,
it's almost midnight.

11:54.104 --> 11:55.104
Yes, I'll hold.

11:55.517 --> 11:57.043
The ride back
was invigorating.

11:57.374 --> 11:59.310
The turbulence over Ohio

11:59.345 --> 12:02.780
was like being in the belly
of a seizing whale.

12:03.974 --> 12:05.909
I screamed
like a little girl.

12:05.944 --> 12:06.996
I'm sure
that went over well

12:07.031 --> 12:08.520
with the rest
of the passengers.

12:08.555 --> 12:09.639
No, it's Bishop.

12:09.754 --> 12:11.539
B-I-S-H-O-P.

12:11.738 --> 12:13.271
<i>Yes, we got the body.</i>

12:13.625 --> 12:14.385
What's that about?

12:15.093 --> 12:16.397
They detained our bags.

12:16.728 --> 12:17.480
Raw milk?

12:18.063 --> 12:19.042
No, I'm pretty sure

12:19.092 --> 12:21.429
Dr. Bishop wouldn't have packed
a bottle of raw--

12:21.433 --> 12:22.341
[moos]

12:23.355 --> 12:23.816
Milk.

12:24.303 --> 12:26.237
Yes, I understand
it's against the law.

12:26.238 --> 12:27.052
I'm a federal agent.

12:27.573 --> 12:30.774
That's odd--
nine stitches...

12:31.023 --> 12:32.072
Surgical.

12:36.137 --> 12:37.695
There's no reason
for an incision there.

12:40.954 --> 12:42.092
Astricks,

12:42.162 --> 12:44.156
my small bone saw,
please.

12:44.463 --> 12:45.420
Astrid.

12:45.599 --> 12:46.422
Yes?

12:46.593 --> 12:48.483
<i>Dr. Bishop,</i>
<i>I-I'm sorry,</i>

12:48.595 --> 12:50.964
but, uh, those bags
won't be available to us

12:50.965 --> 12:51.745
<i>until morning.</i>

12:52.567 --> 12:53.775
That's okay.

12:54.035 --> 12:57.194
In fact, you can assist us
in removing his scalp.

12:58.774 --> 13:01.037
Once you get used to the smell,
it's really quite something.

13:01.043 --> 13:01.617
Come on.

13:05.199 --> 13:06.272
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:06.307 --> 13:07.186
I didn't wake you,
did I?

13:17.126 --> 13:17.713
What?

13:18.628 --> 13:19.188
Cute.

13:20.229 --> 13:22.230
Except in my case,
I actually graduated.

13:22.231 --> 13:24.449
I'm guessing,
uh, you bought yours

13:24.484 --> 13:25.654
to impress the girls.

13:26.279 --> 13:27.324
Yeah, more or less.

13:27.570 --> 13:28.890
So what you got?

13:29.073 --> 13:30.310
Greg Leader's sleep journal.

13:32.076 --> 13:32.886
His wife was right.

13:33.410 --> 13:34.911
For the last couple months,
he's been averaging

13:34.912 --> 13:36.919
between eight and ten hours
of sleep every night.

13:37.014 --> 13:38.894
Then how can he die
of exhaustion?

13:38.929 --> 13:39.733
<i>It gets weirder.</i>

13:39.951 --> 13:41.702
<i>He was also using it</i>
<i>as a dream diary.</i>

13:42.423 --> 13:44.021
Guess what his
nightmares were about.

13:45.443 --> 13:45.904
Demons?

13:45.993 --> 13:47.305
Yeah.
At least once a week.

13:47.561 --> 13:50.762
Then a couple months ago,
all of a sudden, they stop.

13:50.829 --> 13:53.762
So do you think this is some kind
of extreme sleepwalking?

13:54.053 --> 13:56.440
No, sleepwalkers
don't generally get violent.

13:56.475 --> 13:57.382
And unlike Greg Leader,

13:57.417 --> 13:58.774
they don't remember
their experiences.

13:59.087 --> 14:00.859
Where'd you learn that?
M.I.T.?

14:02.101 --> 14:04.228
As a kid, I used to get
these terrible nightmares,

14:04.378 --> 14:05.294
almost every night.

14:05.444 --> 14:07.197
So I know a thing or two
about dreaming.

14:07.548 --> 14:09.183
I'm sorry.
That must have been awful.

14:10.384 --> 14:12.786
Actually, it was one
of the rare occasions

14:12.787 --> 14:14.927
in my childhood
that Walter was helpful.

14:15.669 --> 14:18.110
He taught me
to condition myself.

14:18.428 --> 14:19.860
Every night
before I went to sleep,

14:19.861 --> 14:21.489
I had to say
a mantra in my head.

14:21.729 --> 14:24.698
"Please don't dream tonight.
Please don't dream tonight.

14:24.699 --> 14:25.929
Please don't dream tonight."

14:27.068 --> 14:28.056
Did that work?

14:28.203 --> 14:29.837
Well, you can't stop yourself
from dreaming,

14:29.838 --> 14:31.380
but it did make it
so that I didn't remember.

14:32.294 --> 14:35.881
From the age
of 8 to almost 19,

14:35.916 --> 14:37.122
don't remember
a single dream.

14:37.713 --> 14:38.977
No more nightmares.

14:40.082 --> 14:41.554
[cell phone rings]

14:47.624 --> 14:49.113
There's been
another incident.

14:51.598 --> 14:53.464
MAN: <i>Guy on the bike</i>
<i>was dead on impact.</i>

14:53.465 --> 14:55.421
<i>Must have been driving</i>
<i>40 miles per hour</i>

14:55.472 --> 14:57.472
- <i>which killed him.</i>
- <i>Crash-killed her, too?</i>

14:57.795 --> 14:59.571
<i>She's dead</i>
<i>but it wasn't the crash.</i>

15:00.038 --> 15:01.440
MAN: <i>Ellen was calling</i>
<i>to let me know</i>

15:01.475 --> 15:03.101
<i>she was heading home</i>
<i>from the office.</i>

15:04.298 --> 15:05.832
We were on the phone
when she...

15:07.513 --> 15:09.334
She said
she saw a monster.

15:09.882 --> 15:11.478
Did--did you see
her white hair?

15:12.551 --> 15:13.697
What happened to her?

15:15.745 --> 15:17.826
Hold it steady,
Agent Casper.

15:18.056 --> 15:19.293
It's Cashner.

15:21.204 --> 15:22.255
Do this kind
of thing often?

15:22.290 --> 15:24.123
Brains? No.

15:25.678 --> 15:28.150
Although Walter
gets particularly excited

15:28.185 --> 15:29.071
<i>whenever we do.</i>

15:30.822 --> 15:31.865
Hmm.

15:32.571 --> 15:33.660
Look at that.

15:36.908 --> 15:37.724
Would you call Peter?

15:49.126 --> 15:50.170
Ugh. I'm out.

15:52.122 --> 15:53.743
Hey, I've got Walter
for you.

15:53.778 --> 15:56.124
PETER: <i>A filament?</i>
<i>What kind of filament?</i>

15:56.326 --> 15:58.231
Hold on a second, fellas.
Mind if I take a look at her?

16:01.131 --> 16:04.684
Some kind
of little computer chip

16:04.701 --> 16:06.351
imbedded in his midbrain.

16:06.803 --> 16:07.972
The thalamus?

16:08.438 --> 16:10.489
Yes, that would make sense.
Well done, son.

16:11.138 --> 16:12.695
Hold up, Walter.
Agent Dunham!

16:13.397 --> 16:14.190
Excuse me.

16:14.344 --> 16:16.929
What does that do--
the thalamus?

16:16.947 --> 16:18.604
Why is it relevant?

16:18.639 --> 16:20.998
It's the part of the brain
that regulates sleep.

16:24.007 --> 16:25.050
What are you looking for?

16:28.859 --> 16:29.658
That.

16:39.409 --> 16:41.662
BROYLES: <i>Both the victims</i>
<i>had been surgically implanted.</i>

16:41.829 --> 16:42.893
<i>It's a bio-chip.</i>

16:43.014 --> 16:46.066
<i>Technically a brain-computer</i>
<i>interface, or BCI.</i>

16:46.346 --> 16:47.510
<i>This particular chip</i>

16:47.545 --> 16:49.416
has a transmitter,
which makes it wireless.

16:49.438 --> 16:52.755
So it can commit the brain
to a remote computer?

16:53.108 --> 16:53.739
That's right.

16:54.610 --> 16:56.405
From what
we can ascertain,

16:56.406 --> 16:58.001
we think it works
a lot like a pacemaker.

16:58.883 --> 16:59.880
It monitors sleep cycles

16:59.970 --> 17:02.509
and, when necessary,
stimulates the thalamus,

17:02.544 --> 17:04.374
which induces
a deeper sleep state.

17:04.819 --> 17:06.690
<i>There is a researcher</i>
<i>in Seattle</i>

17:06.724 --> 17:08.890
<i>who has worked on</i>
<i>several prototypes like it.</i>

17:09.426 --> 17:10.732
<i>The man's a genius.</i>

17:11.061 --> 17:12.332
<i>We've been tracking him</i>
<i>for years.</i>

17:13.098 --> 17:13.875
Thank you.

17:16.101 --> 17:17.267
I'll let the team know.

17:19.570 --> 17:20.788
Dr. Laxmeesh Nayak?

17:20.940 --> 17:23.115
I'm Olivia Dunham.
I'm with the FBI.

17:24.743 --> 17:27.618
We were wondering if you
were familiar with Greg Leader

17:28.114 --> 17:30.200
and Ellen Rosiello.

17:31.619 --> 17:33.671
Yes, they're patients.

17:34.521 --> 17:35.821
What's this about?

17:35.823 --> 17:38.792
Both of them recently
committed homicidal attacks

17:38.827 --> 17:39.494
and then died,

17:39.827 --> 17:42.795
as a result of what appears
to be extreme exhaustion.

17:42.796 --> 17:43.575
Oh, God.

17:43.753 --> 17:45.585
Dr. Nayak,
we found a bio-chip

17:45.586 --> 17:47.331
imbedded
in Mr. Leader's brain.

17:47.635 --> 17:49.636
- Do you know--
- Yes. Yes, of course.

17:49.637 --> 17:51.512
They both had them.
They were part of a study.

17:52.415 --> 17:54.511
So you've implanted those chips
into other people?

17:54.710 --> 17:56.274
It's a large-scale,
clinical trial.

17:56.325 --> 17:57.880
There are 60
in the control group

17:57.915 --> 18:00.177
and 82
with the bio-chips.

18:00.616 --> 18:01.733
We're gonna need
their names,

18:02.085 --> 18:03.078
all of them.

18:03.854 --> 18:05.490
I've been working
on this chip for years.

18:05.551 --> 18:07.292
I've tested it extensively.

18:07.657 --> 18:08.769
PETER:
And there's no malfunction

18:08.831 --> 18:10.513
that could have caused
the kind of reaction we saw?

18:10.894 --> 18:11.997
What if
the chip shorted out?

18:12.362 --> 18:14.453
Even if it had, the chip
should have remained benign.

18:16.046 --> 18:17.103
Why is this...?

18:17.138 --> 18:19.021
[ominous music]

18:24.642 --> 18:25.744
Wait here.

18:36.554 --> 18:37.807
The main computer server.

18:38.823 --> 18:41.197
It contained all my research--
the patients' files.

18:42.361 --> 18:43.362
It's all gone.

18:45.263 --> 18:46.497
<i>The patients' files</i>

18:46.498 --> 18:48.409
are backed up
on a remote server.

18:49.034 --> 18:50.470
I'll give you
the password.

18:55.166 --> 18:55.847
Dr. Nayak.

18:56.456 --> 18:57.751
My research assistant.

18:58.511 --> 19:00.002
Zach, call the nurses.

19:00.052 --> 19:01.513
We need the names
of all the patients.

19:01.514 --> 19:02.655
<i>Everyone</i>
<i>they can remember.</i>

19:03.015 --> 19:05.685
Sure.
Uh, I-I'll get right on it.

19:07.587 --> 19:08.417
The password.

19:09.755 --> 19:10.509
Thank you.

19:11.557 --> 19:13.217
Dr. Nayak,
can you think of anyone

19:13.287 --> 19:14.825
who would want to steal
your data

19:15.260 --> 19:16.713
or might
want to sabotage you?

19:17.196 --> 19:18.523
I-I don't know.

19:19.331 --> 19:21.219
I-I suppose there are
any number of companies.

19:21.433 --> 19:22.369
The chip was valuable?

19:22.568 --> 19:24.487
Oh, the initial testing
has been remarkable.

19:25.071 --> 19:26.957
It's cured sleepwalking,
night terrors...

19:27.219 --> 19:29.301
All major non-REM
sleep disorders.

19:31.343 --> 19:33.315
These people
just wanted some rest,

19:34.003 --> 19:35.545
and my chip
was helping them.

19:36.014 --> 19:37.454
It wouldn't make them
hurt anyone,

19:37.524 --> 19:39.092
and it certainly
wouldn't kill them.

19:39.618 --> 19:41.208
It just doesn't make
any sense.

19:43.524 --> 19:45.023
Dr. Nayak, do you have
a business card?

19:45.618 --> 19:46.953
Just for our records.

19:50.330 --> 19:51.362
I'll get you one.

20:01.073 --> 20:02.842
Well, the doctor
is beside himself.

20:02.877 --> 20:04.687
And aside from the obvious,
which is money,

20:04.722 --> 20:05.799
he can't think
of any reason

20:05.849 --> 20:07.735
why someone would want
to steal his research.

20:07.813 --> 20:08.511
I can.

20:09.048 --> 20:11.015
The bio-chip plugs directly
into the thalamus,

20:11.016 --> 20:12.283
which not only
regulates sleep,

20:12.284 --> 20:13.505
it also works
as a relay tower

20:13.556 --> 20:14.497
to the cerebral cortex,

20:14.596 --> 20:17.281
which also controls
motor function.

20:18.324 --> 20:19.657
WALTER:
<i>Mind control, Peter.</i>

20:20.079 --> 20:22.627
Wouldn't be the first time
someone's attempted it.

20:23.721 --> 20:25.229
I told you
about my work

20:25.230 --> 20:27.161
with the MK-ultra project.

20:27.666 --> 20:30.236
Of course, at that time,
we supposed we could do it

20:30.271 --> 20:32.904
<i>with LSD</i>
<i>and hypnotic suggestion.</i>

20:32.905 --> 20:34.135
So it is possible?

20:34.206 --> 20:35.350
<i>Theoretically, yes.</i>

20:35.989 --> 20:37.141
If I faxed you a schematic

20:37.142 --> 20:38.701
of the device's
internal architecture,

20:38.944 --> 20:40.202
could you test
the chip you have?

20:40.455 --> 20:43.804
Yes, but I'd need to replicate
the chip's function

20:43.816 --> 20:45.380
in a neutral environment.

20:45.651 --> 20:48.179
Of course, I-if I had
a live subject...

20:48.187 --> 20:49.706
Walter, no.

20:49.856 --> 20:51.313
<i>No student volunteers.</i>

20:51.443 --> 20:53.601
Good news:
The bags are back.

20:54.294 --> 20:55.989
<i>Walter. Walter.</i>

20:56.062 --> 20:59.112
Walter, say it--
"No students."

20:59.976 --> 21:02.001
All right,
no students.

21:04.338 --> 21:04.986
[phone beeps]

21:05.906 --> 21:07.657
OLIVIA: Okay, well, get back
to me as soon as you can.

21:08.109 --> 21:08.974
<i>Hey.</i>

21:09.072 --> 21:09.773
Hey.

21:10.945 --> 21:13.218
So, uh,
did you reach Walter?

21:13.548 --> 21:14.170
Yeah.

21:14.682 --> 21:15.976
He thinks it could be
mind control,

21:16.026 --> 21:17.618
but modifying the bio-chips

21:17.619 --> 21:18.896
would take a lot
of trial and error.

21:18.987 --> 21:20.260
So he thinks
that someone's

21:20.310 --> 21:21.725
trying to perfect
mind control

21:21.795 --> 21:23.029
one patient at a time?

21:24.059 --> 21:25.536
Well, that would explain
why the events

21:25.646 --> 21:27.514
are seemingly
without motive.

21:27.515 --> 21:28.055
Yeah.

21:28.064 --> 21:29.388
How's the patient
roundup going?

21:29.566 --> 21:31.753
<i>Nayak could only list</i>
<i>26 patients.</i>

21:32.909 --> 21:36.104
So the local P.D. are taking
them into his clinic

21:36.139 --> 21:38.432
and removing their chips,

21:38.541 --> 21:39.337
so to speak.

21:39.409 --> 21:40.934
That still leaves, what?

21:40.935 --> 21:42.268
50-odd patients.

21:56.126 --> 21:56.982
Listen...

22:00.730 --> 22:02.011
Olivia,
I think I understand

22:02.091 --> 22:03.874
what it is
that you're going through, but...

22:04.167 --> 22:05.599
that thing
that you killed...

22:06.612 --> 22:07.984
<i>That wasn't Charlie.</i>

22:08.019 --> 22:08.685
I know.

22:14.177 --> 22:15.529
It's just, I--

22:17.013 --> 22:19.082
You know,
my first week on the job,

22:19.954 --> 22:21.963
I was on
a sting operation.

22:22.885 --> 22:24.774
These Irish thugs

22:24.845 --> 22:27.496
were smuggling guns
and--and cocaine.

22:27.690 --> 22:31.551
And I had been
a military prosecutor,

22:31.631 --> 22:33.587
so I hadn't handled
a gun

22:33.863 --> 22:35.355
since basic training.

22:35.898 --> 22:37.532
And suddenly,

22:37.533 --> 22:40.469
I'm underground
in this garage,

22:40.504 --> 22:43.304
wearing
a bulletproof vest

22:43.305 --> 22:45.902
and--and wondering
how the hell I got there.

22:46.085 --> 22:48.911
So I did what
any rookie would do,

22:48.912 --> 22:50.358
and I started looking
for an exit.

22:51.615 --> 22:54.495
And then Charlie
walks over.

22:55.286 --> 22:57.067
This man
that I didn't know--

22:57.555 --> 22:59.107
This gruff guy.

22:59.256 --> 23:00.376
And...

23:01.992 --> 23:02.794
He said...

23:05.162 --> 23:06.251
"You're gonna be fine."

23:15.706 --> 23:18.455
And, um,
I have to face it...

23:20.844 --> 23:21.786
That he...

23:23.013 --> 23:23.956
He's gone...

23:26.183 --> 23:27.638
And that
he's not coming back.

23:28.152 --> 23:30.459
So I'm just gonna go

23:31.289 --> 23:32.583
to Nayak's clinic

23:32.673 --> 23:36.161
and--and see if
I can help the nurse

23:36.196 --> 23:38.083
identify
some other patients.

23:40.532 --> 23:41.675
[door opens]

23:42.267 --> 23:43.656
- Okay.
- [door closes]

23:48.812 --> 23:50.125
[computer whirring]

24:02.150 --> 24:04.433
That was a double order
on table nine, pop.

24:04.690 --> 24:07.105
So what'd your friends
think of my moussaka?

24:07.126 --> 24:08.688
Like they'd died
and gone to Heaven.

24:09.025 --> 24:09.943
Damn right.

24:15.594 --> 24:17.655
<i>Do you really want</i>
<i>to increase the dose?</i>

24:33.553 --> 24:35.897
[ominous music]

25:17.374 --> 25:21.189
[whistling]

25:24.461 --> 25:28.349
[door opens and closes]

25:31.689 --> 25:33.886
Dr. Bishop, I'm heading
to the airport,

25:33.958 --> 25:35.188
back to Seattle.

25:35.960 --> 25:37.360
Would you say good-bye

25:37.361 --> 25:38.825
to Agent Farnsworth
for me?

25:38.829 --> 25:39.857
Certainly.

25:40.264 --> 25:43.720
Oh, before you go,
could you do me a favor

25:43.755 --> 25:45.175
and smell this?

25:45.337 --> 25:48.303
It seems my olfactory sense
is a bit muddled.

25:48.735 --> 25:51.082
Must be the French roast coffee
I had for breakfast.

25:52.846 --> 25:53.812
[sniffs]

25:55.280 --> 25:56.333
Raspberry?

26:15.371 --> 26:17.982
Keep Miss Barage sedated
for another ten minutes.

26:18.275 --> 26:20.065
Then bring in
my next patient.

26:23.882 --> 26:24.882
MAN:
What's going on here?

26:24.883 --> 26:26.073
MAN: I understand
you're all upset.

26:26.251 --> 26:28.571
We should contact
the local pharmacies too.

26:28.606 --> 26:30.073
They should be able
to identify

26:30.108 --> 26:31.331
- who's filled a prescription
- [cell phone rings]

26:31.411 --> 26:33.505
within the last six months
from Dr. Nayak.

26:34.326 --> 26:36.143
Excuse me.
Hello?

26:36.303 --> 26:37.800
What's shakin', Bacon?

26:38.164 --> 26:40.740
<i>Oh, the usual--I'm just</i>
<i>painting my toenails</i>

26:40.775 --> 26:42.899
and planning on taking
a trip up the coast.

26:42.934 --> 26:44.270
You get
the business cards?

26:45.016 --> 26:46.782
Uh, yeah.

26:47.574 --> 26:49.812
I got, uh--
I got eight of them.

26:49.944 --> 26:52.396
Eight? You asked everyone
you saw wearing red?

26:52.647 --> 26:53.337
<i>Yeah.</i>

26:54.182 --> 26:55.445
So what do I do now?

26:55.446 --> 26:57.775
<i>Lay them out in front of you</i>
<i>like you're playing Go Fish.</i>

26:58.017 --> 27:01.359
Now take a pen, circle one letter
in every name,

27:01.429 --> 27:02.846
<i>both first and last.</i>

27:04.620 --> 27:05.835
<i>When you're finished,</i>

27:05.862 --> 27:07.968
<i>take all the letters</i>
<i>you've circled</i>

27:08.003 --> 27:10.205
<i>and write them down</i>
<i>on a piece of paper.</i>

27:10.536 --> 27:11.349
<i>Got it?</i>

27:11.869 --> 27:12.492
Okay.

27:15.383 --> 27:16.157
<i>Now what?</i>

27:16.207 --> 27:17.442
Now jumble.

27:18.675 --> 27:19.878
Jumble?

27:19.945 --> 27:22.457
Jumble, anagram,
word puzzle.

27:22.492 --> 27:23.721
<i>Find the phrase.</i>

27:24.183 --> 27:25.500
What phrase?

27:26.552 --> 27:28.270
What--what am I
looking for?

27:28.305 --> 27:30.047
<i>Whatever it is</i>
<i>you need to hear.</i>

27:30.423 --> 27:32.591
You'll figure it out.
Got to go.

27:41.034 --> 27:42.417
[cell phone rings]

27:43.503 --> 27:45.358
You know, I really don't have
any time for this.

27:45.393 --> 27:46.086
BROYLES: <i>Dunham.</i>

27:46.585 --> 27:47.765
Agent Broyles?

27:48.516 --> 27:50.042
Nayak's patient files
are gone.

27:50.043 --> 27:51.443
The server
at the data-storage facility

27:51.523 --> 27:53.723
was wiped some time
within the last 24 hours.

27:53.758 --> 27:56.090
Can we trace
the hacker's I.P. address?

27:56.125 --> 27:57.139
<i>We don't think</i>
<i>there was one.</i>

27:57.484 --> 27:59.452
There's no sign
of a D.D.O.S. attack,

27:59.453 --> 28:01.521
and given the level of online
security in the facility,

28:01.522 --> 28:02.614
we think whoever
wiped the files

28:02.665 --> 28:03.697
must have
had a password.

28:03.732 --> 28:05.391
So it was someone
in the clinic?

28:05.513 --> 28:06.462
It would seem that way.

28:07.411 --> 28:08.709
It's not possible.

28:08.861 --> 28:10.858
My employees
are good people.

28:11.374 --> 28:13.029
They've all
worked here for years.

28:13.064 --> 28:14.300
We're a family.

28:14.335 --> 28:15.749
But they all
had the password?

28:15.769 --> 28:17.437
There was no reason
for them not to.

28:18.038 --> 28:18.806
I'm telling you...

28:19.206 --> 28:21.186
none of them
would have done this.

28:21.924 --> 28:22.614
PETER:
<i>Agent Dunham.</i>

28:23.096 --> 28:23.873
Another one.

28:24.691 --> 28:26.551
MAN: <i>Her eyes</i>
<i>were going crazy.</i>

28:27.047 --> 28:29.234
Her hair turned white,
then she collapsed.

28:30.461 --> 28:32.125
I don't understand.

28:32.820 --> 28:34.764
She screamed
we were cannibals

28:35.146 --> 28:37.121
<i>and then attacked</i>
<i>with a knife.</i>

28:37.156 --> 28:38.976
I had to wrestle it
away from her.

28:39.494 --> 28:41.405
She--she was so happy.

28:41.929 --> 28:44.589
[crying]
This doesn't make sense.

28:50.137 --> 28:52.162
[crying]

28:55.541 --> 28:57.591
NAYAK: <i>Leanne suffered</i>
<i>from night terrors.</i>

28:58.813 --> 29:01.376
She was just
in my office last week.

29:02.140 --> 29:03.872
We're gonna have to make
a public announcement.

29:04.583 --> 29:06.358
I'm gonna get
our media liaison

29:06.393 --> 29:08.277
<i>to put an announcement</i>
<i>on the local news.</i>

29:09.655 --> 29:12.819
Zach Miller,
my lab assistant...

29:13.822 --> 29:14.820
skipped work today.

29:14.855 --> 29:16.345
He hasn't been answering
his phone.

29:19.436 --> 29:21.719
Zach Miller?
FBI.

30:06.847 --> 30:07.857
Olivia.

30:10.186 --> 30:12.297
I guess that's why he wasn't
answering the phone.

30:22.308 --> 30:25.832
Walter, what's wrong
with Agent Cashner?

30:28.273 --> 30:29.400
I drugged him.

30:30.609 --> 30:32.237
<i>You</i> drugged him?

30:32.593 --> 30:33.634
Walter...

30:33.945 --> 30:36.216
Don't tell me you put
that chip in his head.

30:36.281 --> 30:38.717
No, but I wanted to.

30:39.451 --> 30:42.198
Then I realized
that I could attach the chip

30:42.233 --> 30:43.804
<i>to an E.E.G. net,</i>

30:44.172 --> 30:46.247
<i>and the signal</i>
<i>would reach his brain.</i>

30:46.658 --> 30:49.020
And how are you going
to send him commands?

30:49.055 --> 30:52.654
I have wired
the neurostimulator

30:52.689 --> 30:54.064
to the same frequency.

30:54.099 --> 30:56.006
If Peter's theory
is correct

30:56.041 --> 30:57.976
<i>and this is
mind control,</i>

30:58.375 --> 31:01.396
then the chip should receive
commands from here,

31:01.431 --> 31:04.510
<i>through the neurostimulator.</i>
<i>It's then translated</i>

31:04.545 --> 31:07.905
into impulses
that Agent Cashner's brain

31:07.940 --> 31:08.821
can understand.

31:09.314 --> 31:11.986
I need help
putting this on.

31:12.021 --> 31:14.968
Walter, I do not think
this is a very good idea.

31:15.230 --> 31:16.744
Don't be such a grinch.

31:16.822 --> 31:19.002
I've told you,
science should be fun.

31:19.037 --> 31:19.705
Come on.

31:20.901 --> 31:21.934
WALTER:
Look at his feet.

31:22.427 --> 31:23.910
ASTRID:
<i>Feet. Got it.</i>

31:25.224 --> 31:26.460
Anything?

31:27.816 --> 31:28.598
Nope.

31:29.000 --> 31:29.926
[sighs,
breathes heavy]

31:35.090 --> 31:36.205
Walter, what is it?

31:36.307 --> 31:38.641
[groans]

31:38.809 --> 31:41.460
Either a green unicorn
just raced across the lab,

31:41.495 --> 31:43.365
or I accidentally
took some LSD.

31:45.282 --> 31:47.308
Oh, it must be mescaline.

31:48.181 --> 31:49.982
It's peaking
too quickly.

31:51.555 --> 31:53.856
Oh. Oh, God.

31:54.405 --> 31:55.833
That's not mescaline.

31:56.827 --> 31:59.394
<i>It's something else</i>
<i>entirely.</i>

32:02.333 --> 32:04.261
I think it's not
the drugs at all.

32:04.547 --> 32:07.919
I think I have an idea
what it is.

32:14.178 --> 32:16.071
And you've never gotten
anything like this before?

32:16.312 --> 32:18.615
No, of course not.

32:19.150 --> 32:20.639
Okay, I'm gonna send
a copy of this

32:20.674 --> 32:22.250
to our
question documents unit.

32:22.501 --> 32:24.449
<i>They'll analyze</i>
<i>the handwriting,</i>

32:24.484 --> 32:25.801
the paper, and the ink.

32:26.290 --> 32:28.858
But in the meantime,
the police have offered to put

32:28.859 --> 32:31.132
a protective detail
outside your clinic,

32:31.295 --> 32:33.494
and Detective Green
will watch your house.

32:34.055 --> 32:35.452
Now, if you'll excuse us,

32:35.660 --> 32:37.952
we're gonna try and track down
the rest of your patients.

32:39.603 --> 32:40.970
Don't worry, Dr. Nayak.

32:40.971 --> 32:42.135
We're gonna catch
this guy.

32:43.440 --> 32:44.678
Then you can
get back to your work.

32:45.723 --> 32:47.594
<i>We'll call you as soon</i>
<i>as we know something.</i>

32:55.531 --> 32:56.395
[static]

33:00.772 --> 33:02.258
AUTOMATED VOICE:
<i>Please leave a message</i>

33:02.339 --> 33:03.371
<i>after the tone.</i>

33:04.445 --> 33:05.507
I told them.

33:07.091 --> 33:09.531
I showed them
your damn note.

33:11.724 --> 33:13.805
So you might
as well stop.

33:17.881 --> 33:19.236
PETER:
<i>So it's not mind control?</i>

33:19.651 --> 33:21.214
WALTER: <i>No, Peter,</i>
<i>your theory is wrong.</i>

33:21.592 --> 33:25.526
Dr. Nayak's chips
aren't receiving commands.

33:25.561 --> 33:27.565
They're transmitting
massive amounts of data.

33:28.044 --> 33:30.460
Walter, the bio-chips
are supposed to transmit data.

33:30.495 --> 33:32.548
That's their function,
to monitor sleep cycles.

33:32.583 --> 33:35.411
<i>The chips aren't simply</i>
<i>monitoring sleep.</i>

33:35.446 --> 33:38.399
They're accessing
all the sensory information

33:38.434 --> 33:41.062
that--that passes
through the thalamus--

33:41.097 --> 33:43.723
Every color, sound,

33:43.758 --> 33:45.709
<i>and picture</i>
<i>while we sleep.</i>

33:45.710 --> 33:48.231
Walter, are you saying
that Dr. Nayak's bio-chips

33:48.266 --> 33:49.447
are stealing dreams?

33:49.448 --> 33:50.402
<i>That's right, dear.</i>

33:52.329 --> 33:53.583
Leader's sleep journal.

33:53.719 --> 33:56.783
He slept for hours,
but he never had any dreams.

33:56.818 --> 33:58.956
Before they reached
his consciousness,

33:58.991 --> 34:00.602
they were
all siphoned off,

34:00.637 --> 34:02.261
<i>which means no dreams.</i>

34:02.262 --> 34:04.938
<i>The brain can never recharge,</i>
<i>and that...</i>

34:04.973 --> 34:06.290
Would lead
to death by exhaustion.

34:06.325 --> 34:07.486
<i>Exactly.</i>

34:07.521 --> 34:08.429
What's more,

34:08.637 --> 34:11.138
I believe the chips
have the ability

34:11.172 --> 34:14.659
to turn on a dreaming state
while the patient is awake,

34:14.677 --> 34:17.792
which would lead
to paranoia, hallucinations,

34:17.827 --> 34:19.597
and a complete inability

34:19.632 --> 34:21.975
to differentiate
between reality and dreams--

34:22.010 --> 34:24.473
<i>The very behavior</i>
<i>we've been witnessing.</i>

34:24.889 --> 34:25.857
Walter, why would anybody

34:25.891 --> 34:27.679
want to access
another person's dreams?

34:28.893 --> 34:30.520
<i>The rush, Peter.</i>

34:30.920 --> 34:33.342
Think of your
most pleasant dream,

34:35.190 --> 34:37.643
multiply that feeling
tenfold,

34:37.770 --> 34:40.574
all mainlining
through your cortex

34:40.610 --> 34:41.676
in a few seconds.

34:43.275 --> 34:44.815
It's really quite something.

34:46.411 --> 34:48.972
Walter, are you saying that
we're dealing with an addict?

34:49.815 --> 34:51.431
<i>Not just an addict,</i>
<i>dear.</i>

34:51.985 --> 34:54.482
<i>A man who came in contact</i>
<i>with this drug--</i>

34:55.289 --> 34:56.621
<i>In my estimation,</i>

34:56.623 --> 34:58.460
<i>that man would become</i>
<i>its slave.</i>

35:00.060 --> 35:01.704
We got to go back
to the hotel.

35:02.950 --> 35:04.118
What are you thinking?

35:05.633 --> 35:07.748
Walter thinks we're looking
for an addict, right?

35:08.203 --> 35:11.482
Well, my stepfather
was an addict.

35:11.731 --> 35:12.749
He was a drunk.

35:12.841 --> 35:16.243
And it was like he had
two different personalities--

35:16.831 --> 35:20.202
<i>One when he was sober</i>
<i>and one when he was smashed.</i>

35:20.984 --> 35:23.971
The deeper the addiction,
the more extreme the rift,

35:24.006 --> 35:26.363
like, uh,
Jekyll and Hyde.

35:27.292 --> 35:30.653
So this is the patient list
that Dr. Nayak wrote out,

35:30.688 --> 35:33.301
and here is the death threat
he received.

35:33.723 --> 35:35.459
The handwriting's sloped.

35:36.064 --> 35:38.843
Look at the "G"s
and the "F"s.

35:40.174 --> 35:41.722
These are written
by the same person.

35:45.981 --> 35:47.414
Thank you,
Detective Green.

35:51.954 --> 35:52.390
[machine beeps]

35:52.492 --> 35:54.658
<i>You have one message.</i>

35:54.693 --> 35:55.665
NAYAK:
<i>I told them.</i>

35:56.266 --> 35:57.667
<i>I showed them</i>
<i>your damn note.</i>

35:58.729 --> 36:00.448
<i>So you might as well stop.</i>

36:03.602 --> 36:04.522
<i>Please.</i>

36:22.344 --> 36:24.662
[computers hum to life]

36:27.640 --> 36:29.779
[computers whirring]

36:51.253 --> 36:53.081
Water rudder set.

36:55.030 --> 36:56.066
Thanks, hon.

36:57.927 --> 37:00.222
[computers beeping]

37:14.478 --> 37:17.216
[plane engines whirring]

37:17.629 --> 37:19.644
[air traffic controller chattering]

38:10.013 --> 38:10.935
Jack,
what are you doing?

38:14.497 --> 38:15.151
Jack.

38:17.539 --> 38:18.184
Jack.

38:18.367 --> 38:19.474
Jack, what are you doing?

38:31.013 --> 38:32.314
Jack, we have got to get

38:32.315 --> 38:33.297
this bird in the air.

38:33.549 --> 38:35.806
Jack! November 822,
pilot in distress!

38:35.919 --> 38:36.649
<i>Jack!</i>

38:41.191 --> 38:42.729
OLIVIA:
<i>Peter, he's plugged in.</i>

38:42.912 --> 38:44.216
PETER: Let me try
to shut down the program.

38:50.367 --> 38:52.168
November 822 to ATC,

38:52.169 --> 38:53.169
I've got a problem!

38:53.625 --> 38:54.270
PETER:
I'm gonna have to try

38:54.271 --> 38:55.235
to disable the server.

38:58.238 --> 38:59.171
Can you shut it down?

38:59.210 --> 39:00.254
I think it's locked.

39:01.579 --> 39:02.490
Jack!

39:02.580 --> 39:05.240
November 822,
squawking 7700!

39:05.850 --> 39:07.268
Okay, stand back.

39:07.351 --> 39:07.965
Whoa.

39:08.154 --> 39:09.568
[gunshots]

39:18.228 --> 39:20.054
Jack! Jack!

39:22.266 --> 39:23.578
Jack.

39:32.895 --> 39:33.849
He's dead.

39:43.489 --> 39:44.232
Hey.

39:44.757 --> 39:47.405
Got a call from, uh,
radio control at Lake Union--

39:47.760 --> 39:51.234
Incident with a seaplane pilot,
one of Nayak's patients.

39:51.264 --> 39:52.671
They're all safe.

39:53.132 --> 39:53.803
Good work.

39:57.303 --> 39:59.095
I checked out
Nayak's control panel.

39:59.405 --> 40:01.375
All the dials were cranked up
into the red.

40:02.051 --> 40:04.609
You think
he decided to go down

40:04.690 --> 40:06.483
in one final blaze
of glory?

40:08.080 --> 40:10.293
Actually, I think it was a lot
more complicated than that.

40:11.676 --> 40:13.217
You remember
how horrified Nayak was

40:13.218 --> 40:14.662
when we told him
his patients were dying?

40:15.220 --> 40:17.022
I don't think
that he was fully aware

40:17.057 --> 40:18.365
of what his darker side
was up to...

40:18.400 --> 40:19.373
Until tonight.

40:19.926 --> 40:22.014
So this was his way of trying
to put a stop to things.

40:22.027 --> 40:23.547
I guess
that's the irony.

40:24.263 --> 40:26.401
His addiction to dreams
became his nightmare,

40:27.061 --> 40:28.582
one that he couldn't
wake up from.

40:30.737 --> 40:32.618
Maybe that was his only way
of ending the nightmare.

42:07.731 --> 42:10.234
[door opens, creaking]

42:17.740 --> 42:20.995
<i>Dad, what's wrong?</i>

42:23.438 --> 42:24.734
[gasps, screams]

42:30.618 --> 42:31.530
<i>What is it?</i>

42:34.255 --> 42:35.033
Nothing.

42:36.290 --> 42:38.245
You were talking
in your sleep.

42:39.093 --> 42:41.568
Yeah, I think I was having
a bad dream.

42:43.430 --> 42:44.578
[chuckles]

42:45.132 --> 42:46.392
I was a kid,

42:46.633 --> 42:47.575
in my room.

42:50.404 --> 42:51.351
You were there.

42:53.941 --> 42:55.404
<i>And the rest?</i>

42:57.084 --> 42:58.108
You don't remember it?

43:02.783 --> 43:03.660
Mm-mm.
