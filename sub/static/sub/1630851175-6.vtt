My partner knew
all the constellations.

44:11.410 --> 44:13.447
We spent hours
in a car together,

44:13.480 --> 44:14.951
driving around the city,

44:14.984 --> 44:16.988
murder to murder,
all day and night,

44:17.021 --> 44:19.660
just looking at terrible things,
and then...

44:19.694 --> 44:21.363
we'd stop somewhere
and have a beer.

44:21.396 --> 44:23.234
Look up at the stars.

44:23.267 --> 44:25.238
See that one right there?

44:25.271 --> 44:27.375
That's the Seven Sisters.

44:27.408 --> 44:30.348
It's so much brighter now.

44:30.381 --> 44:33.420
Think what that sky's gonna
look like in ten years.

44:36.159 --> 44:37.930
I'd like you to stay.

44:37.963 --> 44:39.700
And join us.

44:39.734 --> 44:42.472
I like you, girls like you.

44:42.506 --> 44:45.011
(chuckles)

44:45.044 --> 44:47.115
What's funny about that?

44:47.148 --> 44:49.185
You don't know me.

44:52.191 --> 44:54.897
I'm not a good person.

44:55.899 --> 44:57.937
Well, now I'm intrigued.

45:07.322 --> 45:09.159
There was this guy.

45:09.192 --> 45:10.896
He had a wife.

45:10.929 --> 45:12.833
And a kid, a baby.

45:12.866 --> 45:15.071
Half these girls have slept
with married men.

45:16.774 --> 45:19.412
I was with him
the night before...

45:20.949 --> 45:24.122
...it‐it happened and, um...

45:24.155 --> 45:26.260
he had told me

45:26.293 --> 45:28.163
that he was leaving
his wife for me.

45:28.197 --> 45:30.736
He was lying.

45:31.905 --> 45:34.476
I didn't even want him
to leave her.

45:37.181 --> 45:39.419
I think I just felt...

45:42.091 --> 45:44.162
...chosen.

45:44.195 --> 45:47.770
And then I felt... stupid.

45:47.803 --> 45:51.276
I started throwing things
at him and...

45:51.310 --> 45:54.349
all of a sudden, it...

45:54.382 --> 45:57.121
I was angry, but...

45:58.490 --> 46:01.263
...I did not mean to...

46:01.296 --> 46:04.169
You hurt him?

46:12.385 --> 46:14.790
You killed him?

46:23.273 --> 46:25.111
No one knows.

46:25.144 --> 46:27.048
It's like it never happened.

46:29.219 --> 46:32.960
You can't kill somebody
and get away with it.

46:35.599 --> 46:38.437
Seems like you did.

46:39.874 --> 46:42.111
You kick an animal enough times,
it's gonna bite back.

46:42.145 --> 46:44.316
It doesn't mean
it's in their nature.

46:45.852 --> 46:48.457
You can be
whoever you want here.
