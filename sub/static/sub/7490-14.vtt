00:01.917 --> 00:03.000
You can do it, Jack!

00:03.792 --> 00:04.542
What's going on?

00:05.208 --> 00:06.917
Jack's about to do a hippie jump
over the chair,

00:07.000 --> 00:08.667
and then a 360 flip into an Ollie.

00:09.083 --> 00:11.750
That's not Ollie, that's Phil,
and he's gonna be killed.

00:12.583 --> 00:13.792
I got this, baby.

00:13.875 --> 00:16.375
First job in my country, I was speed bump.

00:20.750 --> 00:21.917
- Wow!
- Whoa.

00:33.208 --> 00:35.709
Mind if I snag your ax,
and take it for a scrape?

00:37.000 --> 00:38.667
It... Skateboard.
Can I borrow your skateboard?

00:39.250 --> 00:40.834
Have you ever ridden one before, Rudy?

00:40.917 --> 00:44.375
I'm a third-degree black belt,
I think I can handle a little rolling toy.

00:44.500 --> 00:46.375
Okay, knock yourself out.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.500
-
- Oh!

00:50.583 --> 00:52.375
I think he just knocked himself out.

00:52.917 --> 00:53.875
<i>No, I didn't.</i>

00:53.959 --> 00:55.417

01:43.375 --> 01:46.291
Hey, guys, I've got a very big surprise.

01:46.375 --> 01:49.250
Please tell me you're finally
getting these smelly mats cleaned.

01:49.417 --> 01:52.625
Yeah, they're so moldy,
every week, we have to give them a shave.

01:54.166 --> 01:57.208
Yesterday, when I got home,
my grandfather got a whiff of me,

01:57.291 --> 01:59.417
cried, and said I smelled like the war.

02:00.792 --> 02:02.500
I'm not talking about our mats.

02:02.583 --> 02:04.375
I'm talking about this!

02:06.166 --> 02:07.166
Whoa!

02:07.792 --> 02:09.041
A wall sheet.

02:09.709 --> 02:10.875
It's beautiful.

02:11.458 --> 02:13.333
It's not a wall sheet!

02:14.500 --> 02:15.583
Oh.
Whoa!

02:15.667 --> 02:21.458
Huh? It's a brand new high-def,
surround sound, LED, flat screen TV!

02:21.542 --> 02:22.500
Ah, man!

02:22.583 --> 02:24.458
It's 4:30, "Ninja Space Monkeys" is on.

02:25.041 --> 02:27.542
This isn't for watching
"Ninja Space Monkeys".

02:27.625 --> 02:28.709
Would you give me that?

02:29.291 --> 02:32.750
This is a teaching tool
so we can study our tournament videos.

02:33.417 --> 02:34.917
Milton, let's start with your match.

02:35.458 --> 02:36.667
Here we go.

02:37.041 --> 02:39.041
- It's okay.
- No, it's okay, Milton.

02:39.500 --> 02:41.709
All right, this is all about learning
from our mistakes.

02:41.792 --> 02:42.834
Now, watch carefully.

02:43.834 --> 02:45.375
Okay, here, you're meeting your opponent.

02:45.917 --> 02:48.667
That kid beat Milton? He's tiny.

02:49.333 --> 02:51.041
He wasn't that small, Eddie!

02:51.125 --> 02:53.250
-
- Uh, yeah, he was!

02:53.709 --> 02:55.375
The ref just helped him
out of his stroller.

02:56.750 --> 02:59.750
I don't care how small my opponent was,
he was very tough.

02:59.834 --> 03:02.041
Uh, she, she was very tough.

03:03.750 --> 03:05.667
You know what? I'm out of here.

03:05.750 --> 03:08.000
- What?
- Aw, come on, dude, where are you going?

03:08.375 --> 03:10.417
Somewhere where I can get
a little respect.

03:16.750 --> 03:17.834
Excuse me, Arlo.

03:18.333 --> 03:20.959
My Lemony Zinger needs a little more zing.

03:24.959 --> 03:26.417
Fine, I'll do it myself.

03:28.417 --> 03:30.041
-
- Gah!

03:32.000 --> 03:33.750
Lemon juice in eyes!

03:33.834 --> 03:34.959
Burning!

03:35.959 --> 03:37.458
Stop! Thief!

03:38.000 --> 03:39.542
Ah!

03:41.250 --> 03:43.750
Oh! Cheese and crackers!

03:43.834 --> 03:46.583
You got him! Milton got him, everybody!

03:47.208 --> 03:49.000
That was the longest 30 feet of my life.

03:50.083 --> 03:52.125
Get him out of here! Take him away.

03:52.834 --> 03:53.917
Milton, what happened?

03:54.375 --> 03:57.959
This little squirrel boy
took down the Seaford Snatcher.

03:58.041 --> 04:00.417
Don't change, hero. Don't ever change.

04:02.333 --> 04:04.583
- I was just trying to...
- Do the right thing?

04:05.000 --> 04:06.375
Well, you did, mister.

04:06.750 --> 04:08.375
And because of your bravery,

04:08.458 --> 04:11.875
I award you with this plastic badge.

04:12.542 --> 04:15.583
Which makes you an honorary mall cop.

04:17.667 --> 04:20.917
Milton, this is awesome.
I can't believe you did this.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.375
Well, I did.

04:26.250 --> 04:27.625
I certainly did!

04:31.458 --> 04:32.333
Take me.

04:33.333 --> 04:34.417
Please, take me.

04:35.709 --> 04:36.709
I said, take me!

04:39.583 --> 04:40.667
This machine...

04:41.500 --> 04:42.875
will turn whoever enters it

04:42.959 --> 04:45.083
into the most powerful
crime fighting force,

04:45.166 --> 04:46.500
the world has ever known.

04:47.542 --> 04:49.041
Or it could just give you a few zits.

04:52.083 --> 04:54.041
I'll see you on the other side.

04:55.375 --> 04:56.291
Okay.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.542
Holy Christmas nuts!

05:37.208 --> 05:38.875
I'm huge!

05:40.625 --> 05:41.875
Test his strength.

05:50.667 --> 05:52.750
I think, he passed.

05:54.458 --> 05:57.125
Holy Christmas nuts!

06:01.250 --> 06:02.500
Whoa! Dropping in!

06:03.333 --> 06:04.542
Yeah, Jack!

06:04.709 --> 06:06.542
It's gonna be fun. Whoo!

06:09.333 --> 06:10.709
Whoa, that was awesome.

06:10.792 --> 06:11.709
Thanks.

06:13.667 --> 06:15.709
Rudy, what are you doing here?

06:16.208 --> 06:18.792
Uh, came to thrash.

06:20.208 --> 06:23.250
Last time you were on a board,
you ended up thrashing around in pain.

06:23.917 --> 06:26.208
Well, this time,
I'm going to show this board who's boss

06:26.250 --> 06:28.125
and skate this pipe-half!

06:28.208 --> 06:29.583
- Half-pipe.
- Half-pipe!

06:30.917 --> 06:33.458
I'll rock any pipe you've got, broseph!

06:34.542 --> 06:35.375
Broseph?

06:35.709 --> 06:37.333
What's with the skateboarding
all of a sudden?

06:37.417 --> 06:38.583
Why is it so important to you?

06:39.542 --> 06:42.417
When you get to a certain age, Kim,
you stop doing fun things

06:42.500 --> 06:44.583
like skateboarding, and...

06:44.667 --> 06:47.250
riding the mechanical pony
outside the supermarket.

06:48.583 --> 06:50.834
Rudy, you're too old to skateboard.

06:50.917 --> 06:52.792
Just face it, you can't do this.

06:53.500 --> 06:54.458
Wow.

06:55.583 --> 06:56.458
Maybe you're right.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.875
I mean, I don't even know
why I came down here today.

06:59.667 --> 07:01.709
The torch of youth
only burns for so long and...

07:02.458 --> 07:03.750
today, it's been snuffed.

07:05.333 --> 07:08.000
Rudy, wait! You're not leaving.

07:08.750 --> 07:09.625
I'm not?

07:09.709 --> 07:10.583
No.

07:11.166 --> 07:13.125
You're our Sensei,
and you've never quit on us.

07:13.542 --> 07:14.875
And we're not gonna quit on you.

07:14.959 --> 07:16.458
- But...
- We're going to help you do this.

07:17.083 --> 07:18.166
What are you doing?

07:18.750 --> 07:20.500
I'm not going to let
this man's torch go out.

07:20.959 --> 07:23.166
Okay, Rudy,
the most important thing to do is...

07:23.250 --> 07:25.041
I know, Kim! Just go for it!

07:25.125 --> 07:26.333
Oh, no, no...
Whoo!

07:29.041 --> 07:30.000
Oh.

07:31.875 --> 07:33.250
Great start, Rudy!

07:33.750 --> 07:34.875
Next time...

07:35.125 --> 07:36.625
...might want to try it with your board.

07:39.667 --> 07:41.583

07:43.625 --> 07:45.625
Where's Milton? He missed homeroom.

07:45.709 --> 07:48.250
Uh, I bet he's at home
polishing his badge.

07:48.333 --> 07:50.834
Come on, I think what he did
at the mall yesterday was pretty cool.

07:50.917 --> 07:52.417
Maybe it'll give him some self-esteem.

07:52.500 --> 07:53.750
Uh...

07:54.166 --> 07:55.250
It gave him something.

08:01.208 --> 08:02.166
Milton?

08:03.792 --> 08:04.875
What you wearing?

08:05.750 --> 08:07.083
My uniform.

08:07.917 --> 08:10.125
It's part marching band, part Starfleet.

08:10.583 --> 08:12.166
And all attitude.

08:14.083 --> 08:17.500
You know that plastic badge
doesn't give you any real power, right?

08:18.208 --> 08:19.333
Oh, I've got power.

08:19.875 --> 08:22.041
And I'm not afraid to use it, sister.

08:25.291 --> 08:26.166
Excuse me.

08:30.250 --> 08:33.709
I'm gonna have to ask
to de-wedgify that boy.

08:33.792 --> 08:34.625
What?

08:35.125 --> 08:38.250
I said step away
from the nerd's underpants, mister.

08:39.750 --> 08:40.625
Wait.

08:40.709 --> 08:43.625
Dude, you're the kid that
took down the robber at the mall.

08:44.083 --> 08:47.375
I don't want any trouble.

08:47.458 --> 08:49.834
Good! Now, move it, fella!

08:52.750 --> 08:53.667

09:05.709 --> 09:07.750
I can't get that last call out of my head.

09:08.208 --> 09:10.917
Yeah, your first 14-12 stays with you.

09:11.583 --> 09:15.083
You never forget the sight
of a dead bird in a port-a-pooper.

09:18.542 --> 09:20.667
- Go on, rookie.
- Uh, Jack.

09:21.792 --> 09:25.083
Mall regulations forbid skateboarding
in the courtyard.

09:25.542 --> 09:26.375
Uh-huh.

09:28.166 --> 09:30.750
So, I'm gonna have to ask you to stop.

09:32.917 --> 09:34.417
Yeah, not gonna happen.

09:34.959 --> 09:36.291
- Never hurts to ask.
- Later.

09:40.834 --> 09:44.083
I can't believe what I'm seeing,
what, what was that?

09:44.917 --> 09:47.667
Jack, he kind of plays by his own rules.

09:47.750 --> 09:50.375
Oh, no, no, no,
there's only one set of rules.

09:50.792 --> 09:51.917
But Jack's my friend.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.625
Yeah, a friend that doesn't respect you.

09:54.709 --> 09:59.625
When you put that badge on,
Jack became just another dirty roller.

10:01.875 --> 10:03.458
Wow, you're right.

10:05.625 --> 10:08.000
- My friends still don't respect me.
- Yeah.

10:08.083 --> 10:11.208
And you know how you get that respect?
By enforcing the law!

10:11.542 --> 10:13.000
You close your eyes to Jack...

10:13.709 --> 10:15.208
You might as well close your eyes

10:15.291 --> 10:17.333
to the man that strips down
and swims in the fountain.

10:18.959 --> 10:21.166
Actually, I do close my eyes to that.

10:23.709 --> 10:24.542
But I get it.

10:25.750 --> 10:28.667
Friends or no friends, I'm the law now!

We were lucky we found your tooth.

10:41.792 --> 10:42.750
You know, it's funny.

10:43.250 --> 10:46.250
You never really think about your spleen
until you see it.

10:48.166 --> 10:50.291
You just had to encourage him.

10:50.375 --> 10:52.000
I'm trying to help him.

10:54.458 --> 10:55.417
Milton, what's going on?

10:56.041 --> 10:58.083
I warned Rudy there was mold on the mats.

10:58.166 --> 10:59.291
He didn't take care of it,

10:59.375 --> 11:02.000
so it was my duty
to inform the Health Inspector.

11:03.166 --> 11:05.417
No, no, no, I have
a health certificate right here

11:05.500 --> 11:07.083
that says everything is up to code.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.834
That's your dog's vaccination record.

11:10.667 --> 11:11.875
Expired.

11:13.875 --> 11:15.625
There is nothing wrong with this dojo.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.709
You've got a raging case of mat mold.

11:18.083 --> 11:20.208
Until you take care of it,
I'm shutting you down.

11:21.208 --> 11:23.125
Way to go, Officer Milton.

11:23.208 --> 11:25.542
You did what the termites,
rats, and roaches, couldn't.

11:26.208 --> 11:27.750
Okay, in my defense,

11:27.834 --> 11:30.583
I brought in the rats to get rid
of the termites and the roaches.

11:32.875 --> 11:35.709
Aw, Rudy the owl you ordered is here.

11:37.208 --> 11:38.125
Again...

11:38.875 --> 11:42.333
I brought in the owl,
to get rid of the rats, so...

11:54.917 --> 11:56.792
Closed? What happened?

11:56.875 --> 11:59.500
This beanpole ratted us out
to the Health Inspector.

12:00.834 --> 12:01.709
What?

12:02.250 --> 12:04.917
Dude, are you insane?
You brought a Health Inspector down here?

12:05.458 --> 12:07.166
He didn't find my cheese making locker,
did he?

12:08.458 --> 12:11.458
You make cheese in your locker?
That's disgusting!

12:11.542 --> 12:12.375
Oh...

12:12.667 --> 12:13.667
So you love my quesadillas,

12:13.750 --> 12:15.625
but you don't want to see
where they come from, huh?

12:17.083 --> 12:19.750
Ever since you got that plastic badge,
you've been put of control.

12:20.250 --> 12:24.083
Well, when I see something wrong,
it's my job to do something about it.

12:25.166 --> 12:26.959
Why don't you do something
about your breath?

12:27.041 --> 12:28.750
You can use a mint, sister!

12:37.125 --> 12:38.917
Hey, I just met these guys
in the parking lot,

12:39.000 --> 12:41.333
they gave me a great price
to steam blast the mats.

12:41.417 --> 12:42.834
They even said they could do it tonight.

12:42.917 --> 12:45.834
Great! If we pass the inspection,
the dojo can reopen tomorrow.

12:46.250 --> 12:47.417
That gives us tonight,

12:47.500 --> 12:49.375
Rudy, we have time to go back
to the half-pipe.

12:49.709 --> 12:51.166
<i>Oh, seriously, Kim?</i>

12:51.750 --> 12:54.000
We are not giving up. Get in the car!

12:54.083 --> 12:57.166
No, no, no. U, you know, uh, Jack's right.

12:57.709 --> 13:00.709
It's a little dangerous,
and I finally stopped leaking.

13:01.250 --> 13:03.792
What? Go! Get in the car! Come on, Jack.

13:05.000 --> 13:05.875
Go, go, go!

13:07.250 --> 13:08.917
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

13:10.083 --> 13:12.041
All right, Rudy.
Get in there and tear it up.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.333
I don't wanna tear it up.

13:13.375 --> 13:16.542
If I do, I won't grow another one,
I'm not a starfish!

13:18.667 --> 13:19.542
<i>Jack.</i>

13:20.041 --> 13:21.000
Who's the old dude?

13:21.750 --> 13:23.250
Who are you calling an "old dude"?

13:23.333 --> 13:25.375
I have half a mind to call your parents.

13:27.333 --> 13:28.750
Back off, Randy.

13:29.125 --> 13:30.417
That guy's not a skater.

13:30.500 --> 13:32.959
He's just taking a break.
He's been skating the ramp for an hour.

13:33.041 --> 13:34.667
Yeah, why do you think he's so sweaty?

13:34.792 --> 13:36.417
Certainly not from fear.

13:38.792 --> 13:39.750
Does he have moves?

13:40.458 --> 13:41.834
Does he have moves?

13:41.917 --> 13:43.834
Moves? Of course, he has moves.

13:43.917 --> 13:45.500
Who would come up here without any moves?

13:46.125 --> 13:47.417
I don't have any moves.

13:47.834 --> 13:48.792
You have moves!

13:48.875 --> 13:52.417
No, I... Kim, I appreciate you
trying to help me but...

13:53.000 --> 13:54.542
I've learned my limitations.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.834
I'm never gonna be a skateboarder
and that's okay.

13:57.375 --> 13:58.500
Now, excuse me.

14:01.083 --> 14:01.917
Son...

14:05.000 --> 14:05.917
Son...

14:06.500 --> 14:08.750
this is your house and I respect that.

14:09.250 --> 14:11.166
I shan't stay any longer.

14:11.959 --> 14:14.125
As the handshake was to my generation,

14:14.208 --> 14:15.583
the high five is to yours.

14:15.875 --> 14:17.917
So, won't you give me as you kids say...

14:18.458 --> 14:19.750
"some up top"?

14:22.208 --> 14:23.375
Whatever, gramps.

14:23.959 --> 14:25.083
Whoa!

14:38.083 --> 14:39.875
Oh! Whoa! Whoa!

14:40.458 --> 14:42.125
What just happened!?

14:42.208 --> 14:45.417
Dude, that was the sickest move
I've ever seen!

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Mad respect! Do it again!

14:48.417 --> 14:50.083
Perhaps I could tear it up just a bit.

14:50.166 --> 14:51.709
No, no, no, guys, guys. Our show's over.

14:51.792 --> 14:52.667
- Let's go, Rudy.
- Yeah.

14:52.750 --> 14:54.667
Get in the car.
We're leaving while you're still alive.

14:54.750 --> 14:55.583
No, can't I just...

14:55.667 --> 14:56.959
Get in the car!

15:00.625 --> 15:01.625
Hey, Milton.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.709
- Someone stole our bikes!
- Yeah.

15:04.250 --> 15:06.625
They weren't stolen, I impounded them.

15:07.875 --> 15:10.333
You had them chained
to the Captain Corndog statue.

15:10.709 --> 15:12.166
That's against the rules.

15:13.667 --> 15:14.500
Yeah?

15:15.083 --> 15:16.750
Well, you know what else
is against the rules?

15:17.250 --> 15:18.834
Being a jerk to your friends.

15:19.375 --> 15:20.709
You know, Milton,

15:20.792 --> 15:22.917
I think there's a badge
where your heart used to be.

15:24.083 --> 15:25.792
My heart's still there.

15:25.875 --> 15:28.083
Only now, it's pumping justice!

15:28.709 --> 15:30.875
Strip mall justice!

15:34.041 --> 15:37.041
I, I couldn't help but hear over
what you say, lawman.

15:37.709 --> 15:40.500
Sometimes, you need to give
to your friends the rough loving.

15:42.500 --> 15:43.792
- Thank you, Phil.
- Yeah.

15:43.875 --> 15:45.041
I'm glad someone understand...

15:49.166 --> 15:50.083
What was that?

15:50.500 --> 15:53.500
Uh, definitely not my goat Tootsie,
that is for sure.

15:56.083 --> 15:59.125
Phil, animals in the kitchen
are against the rules.

15:59.250 --> 16:01.959
Why? Tootsie's wearing a hairnet.

16:04.709 --> 16:07.375
Wanna go suck on the nozzles
at the froyo store?

16:07.458 --> 16:08.417
You kidding me?

16:08.834 --> 16:11.417
If Milton saw that,
he'd write us up and put us in mall jail.

16:12.333 --> 16:13.375
There's a mall jail?

16:13.709 --> 16:15.625
Well, kinda. You sit in in Joan's office

16:15.709 --> 16:17.750
while she reads
her high school yearbook and cries.

16:22.083 --> 16:23.792
Gotta get it to the door, you moron.

16:24.792 --> 16:26.333
Oh! Hey.

16:26.917 --> 16:28.166
What are you guys doing here?

16:28.250 --> 16:30.333
Oh, we wanted to watch you guys
steam-blast the mats.

16:31.166 --> 16:32.542
Where's your steam blaster?

16:32.625 --> 16:35.458
It's, uh, out at the steam station.

16:35.792 --> 16:37.125
Yeah, it's getting filled...

16:37.458 --> 16:38.917
with, uh, steam.

16:40.959 --> 16:42.375
Oh, sounds legit.

16:44.083 --> 16:46.667
Jerry, I think these guys are robbers.

16:47.917 --> 16:48.792
<i>What?</i>

16:49.208 --> 16:52.041
Why would Rudy hire robbers
to clean his mats?

16:52.834 --> 16:53.750
Oh.

16:54.792 --> 16:55.625
Oh!

16:56.208 --> 16:57.125
Yeah.

17:03.709 --> 17:04.667
Oops!

17:07.041 --> 17:08.917
Nothing personal, Tootsie.

17:09.875 --> 17:12.083
I gotta take you in for a mug shot.

17:13.083 --> 17:14.792
What's going on in the dojo?

17:21.166 --> 17:22.041
Psst!

17:23.375 --> 17:25.333
Jerry, Eddie, what are you two doing?

17:25.375 --> 17:27.000
You're not authorized to be here.

17:27.375 --> 17:28.667
Neither are they.

17:31.083 --> 17:32.458
They're the cleaning crew.

17:32.834 --> 17:34.834
Yeah, they're cleaning us out.

17:35.709 --> 17:36.542
What?

17:38.500 --> 17:39.417
- You mean--
- Yes.

17:39.500 --> 17:40.333
- They're--
- Yes.

17:40.417 --> 17:41.917
- And you're in the middle of a--
- Yes.

17:47.166 --> 17:49.291
Well this burglary is over.

17:50.500 --> 17:53.041
You, Sir, are under arrest.

17:57.458 --> 17:58.417
Really?

17:59.458 --> 18:01.667
- You're arresting me?
- That's right.

18:05.875 --> 18:08.041
You have the right to remain silent.

18:08.875 --> 18:09.583
You have...

18:09.875 --> 18:13.375
Oh, oh! Resisting arrest,
well, you're in big trouble now.

18:21.125 --> 18:22.375
You happy, Milton?

18:22.750 --> 18:25.041
Look at what you
and your stupid little badge got us in to.

18:25.542 --> 18:27.709
Yeah. You stopped one robbery,

18:27.792 --> 18:29.500
and you think
you're some sort of superhero.

18:30.125 --> 18:31.917
The truth is, I didn't even do that.

18:33.375 --> 18:34.750
The guy slipped on my smoothie,

18:34.834 --> 18:37.250
and I saw a chance
to make myself look big.

18:37.750 --> 18:40.041
Too bad you're not the crime fighter
you pretended to be.

18:41.291 --> 18:43.250
Because that's the guy we need right now.

18:49.834 --> 18:51.667
Holy Christmas nuts!

18:52.375 --> 18:54.333
I'm huge!

19:00.250 --> 19:01.083
<i>Get him!</i>

19:02.959 --> 19:04.542
- Oh!
-

19:14.792 --> 19:16.000
-
- Ah!

19:29.917 --> 19:31.542
Milton, that was sick!

19:33.000 --> 19:33.875
What's going on?

19:34.458 --> 19:36.583
These guys you hired were robbers.

19:36.667 --> 19:38.375
And Milton took them all down.

19:39.041 --> 19:39.875
Milton?

19:40.959 --> 19:43.709
Here they are, officers! Take 'em away!

19:44.417 --> 19:47.250
Oh, I've got to get a scooter.
This beat's killing me.

19:49.375 --> 19:53.542
You Sir, are getting a plastic citation,
for your bravery,

19:54.000 --> 19:55.625
a plastic medal of valor,

19:55.709 --> 19:58.542
and a beautiful plastic sash for your--

19:58.625 --> 19:59.875
No, Joan, stop!

20:00.750 --> 20:02.041
I don't want any of this.

20:03.583 --> 20:05.417
I know I was acting like a jerk.

20:05.917 --> 20:07.417
It's just I was tired of being teased

20:07.500 --> 20:09.458
and I wanted
a little respect from you guys.

20:10.166 --> 20:13.500
Dude just because we busted on you,
doesn't mean we don't respect you.

20:13.583 --> 20:15.709
Yeah, Milton, what you did was incredible.

20:16.500 --> 20:17.375
Thanks.

20:17.834 --> 20:20.125
but I just want things
to go back to the way they were.

20:23.083 --> 20:24.000
Joan...

20:26.375 --> 20:27.834
Please take this badge back.

20:30.000 --> 20:30.875
Ow...

20:30.959 --> 20:32.166
That was the pin.

20:32.250 --> 20:34.000
She's gonna bleed.

20:35.750 --> 20:38.083
I need some backup. Officer has a boo-boo.

20:41.250 --> 20:44.041
Hey, tonight, we celebrate no robbery.

20:44.125 --> 20:46.083
Free falafel on me, let's go!

20:48.375 --> 20:49.792
Yeah. Whoo!
<i>Let's go.</i>

20:51.250 --> 20:52.166
Uh...

20:54.208 --> 20:55.542
They're coming back for us, right?

20:56.208 --> 20:58.792
I hope so, my butts getting numb.

20:59.375 --> 21:00.417
Hey!

21:00.500 --> 21:01.917
- Hey!
- We're over here, come on!

21:03.667 --> 21:05.208
Wow, prom...

21:06.500 --> 21:08.250
I had actually blacked this one out.

21:13.458 --> 21:15.417
That's me at the window looking in.

21:17.417 --> 21:20.291
No, it wasn't raining that night,
those are my tears on the window.

21:22.750 --> 21:25.041
We keep going,
unless you think you've had enough.

21:27.125 --> 21:28.041
Okay...

21:28.500 --> 21:31.625
Moving on to the sad years, I know...
