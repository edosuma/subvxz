00:10.577 --> 00:13.113
Gabriel Wyath, 26.

00:13.247 --> 00:14.931
Engineering student...

00:14.965 --> 00:16.867
diagnosed about five years ago.

00:17.167 --> 00:20.118
Delusions began to grow
increasingly vivid and violent,

00:20.136 --> 00:22.721
eventually requiring
hospitalization.

00:22.755 --> 00:25.290
Gabe has successfully
masked his issues for so long

00:25.308 --> 00:27.292
that by the time
that anyone was aware

00:27.310 --> 00:29.094
of the extent of his problems,

00:29.128 --> 00:31.096
his delusions had convinced him

00:31.131 --> 00:33.482
to try and blow up
a government building.

00:33.516 --> 00:35.150
So what are we looking for

00:35.185 --> 00:37.019
when we make a diagnosis
of schizophrenia?

00:37.070 --> 00:38.403
Steph?

00:38.438 --> 00:39.905
Well, many patients

00:39.939 --> 00:40.939
<i>develop a routine</i>

00:40.973 --> 00:42.374
<i>to help them maintain</i>

00:42.408 --> 00:43.692
<i>the illusion of control.</i>

00:43.726 --> 00:44.843
Double Americano.

00:44.878 --> 00:45.944
Extra shot. Skim milk.

00:45.979 --> 00:47.029
Extra hot. Thanks.

00:48.565 --> 00:49.448
Black coffee?

00:49.482 --> 00:51.350
<i>Despite this, they</i>

00:51.384 --> 00:55.420
<i>outwardly exhibit disorganized</i>
<i>or odd behavior.</i>

00:55.455 --> 00:56.672
I don't think
that's what I ordered.

00:56.706 --> 00:58.423
<i>Which can lead to confusion</i>

00:58.458 --> 01:00.325
and agitation.

01:00.343 --> 01:03.128
Where did you put
the Alderman file?

01:03.162 --> 01:05.964
Who the hell is Alderman?

01:10.169 --> 01:11.136
See?

01:11.170 --> 01:12.838
Right where I said it was.

01:13.940 --> 01:16.391
<i>They might suffer from</i>
<i>coexisting sleep disorders,</i>

01:16.442 --> 01:18.944
<i>including insomnia.</i>

01:18.978 --> 01:20.812
The majority of cases
become unstable

01:20.846 --> 01:21.864
without medication.

01:21.898 --> 01:23.181
Good.

01:23.199 --> 01:24.900
The issue lies in what happens

01:24.951 --> 01:27.186
when a patient
refuses treatment.

01:27.220 --> 01:30.522
<i>Many will endure</i>
<i>confusion, anger</i>

01:30.540 --> 01:32.407
and risk harm to themselves
and others,

01:32.458 --> 01:34.526
<i>all in an effort</i>
<i>to cling to things</i>

01:34.544 --> 01:35.627
<i>that only they see</i>

01:35.662 --> 01:37.963
<i>and understand.</i>

01:37.997 --> 01:40.549
That's what makes
these patients so dangerous.

01:40.583 --> 01:42.050
The delusions
that drive them

01:42.085 --> 01:44.636
also convince them
to try to hide the depth

01:44.671 --> 01:45.721
of their problems.

01:45.755 --> 01:47.422
Our challenge is to...

01:47.473 --> 01:49.141
try to find a way

01:49.175 --> 01:51.927
<i>to help someone</i>
<i>who doesn't want it.</i>

01:51.961 --> 01:54.563
<i>The risk lies in...</i>

01:54.597 --> 01:58.417
<i>the damage</i>
<i>they can do if we fail.</i>

01:59.419 --> 02:01.603
<i>So tell me how this works.</i>

02:01.654 --> 02:03.655
<i>I'm awake with my wife,</i>
<i>and I close me eyes,</i>

02:03.690 --> 02:06.057
<i>I open them...</i>
<i>I'm awake with my son.</i>

02:06.075 --> 02:08.560
And this has been happening
since the accident?

02:10.747 --> 02:12.714
<i>So you began</i>
<i>working on one case</i>

02:12.749 --> 02:13.582
<i>here in reality,</i>

02:13.616 --> 02:15.000
<i>and then suddenly</i>

02:15.034 --> 02:16.285
you begin working another case

02:16.336 --> 02:18.120
<i>there, in your dream.</i>

02:18.154 --> 02:20.455
<i>It all feels</i>
<i>completely real to me.</i>

02:20.506 --> 02:22.574
<i>You can't tell</i>
<i>whether you're awake or asleep</i>

02:22.592 --> 02:23.709
at this very moment?

02:23.743 --> 02:25.394
<i>Well I can assure</i>
<i>you, Detective Britten,</i>

02:25.428 --> 02:26.595
this is not a dream.

02:26.629 --> 02:29.148
That's exactly
what the other shrink said.

02:29.212 --> 02:32.012
AWAKE
S01 Ep06 - That's Not My Penguin

02:32.580 --> 02:36.080
Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

02:37.101 --> 02:39.404
<i>Dad, the school says they don't
have the permission slip.</i>

02:40.310 --> 02:41.977
You told me you turned it in.

02:42.011 --> 02:43.645
How am I not
the account holder

02:43.680 --> 02:45.147
if my name is on the bill?

02:45.181 --> 02:47.399
N-No, don't put me...

02:47.433 --> 02:49.234
I gave it to the teacher,
the guy with the...

02:49.269 --> 02:50.652
thing on his head...
I'll call him.

02:50.687 --> 02:51.687
You can't call.

02:51.738 --> 02:53.322
They had to be
cleared last week.

02:53.356 --> 02:56.074
And I'm sorry, I'll take you
to museum myself... how's that?

02:56.109 --> 02:58.026
It's not about the museum.
It's about the fact that

02:58.077 --> 02:59.995
now I have to spend
the day in study hall

03:00.029 --> 03:02.080
because you didn't turn in a
simple piece of paper.

03:02.115 --> 03:03.699
I'm telling you,
I'm pretty sure I gave...

03:03.750 --> 03:05.650
the guy something, unless
I gave him the phone bill.

03:05.668 --> 03:07.085
Well, no, no, no.

03:07.120 --> 03:08.587
I'm talking to my son.
Don't, don't...

03:08.621 --> 03:10.789
Listen, how could it
take you three days

03:10.823 --> 03:12.341
to switch the service back on

03:12.375 --> 03:14.092
when you have my money today?

03:14.127 --> 03:15.327
Hold on a second.

03:15.345 --> 03:17.346
Yeah?

03:17.380 --> 03:19.181
I'm on my way.

03:19.215 --> 03:21.166
Hello?

03:21.184 --> 03:23.268
Hello?

03:25.104 --> 03:26.638
All right.
You ready to go?

03:26.672 --> 03:28.974
I told you yesterday,
Cole's dad is taking me.

03:29.008 --> 03:31.509
- I'll text you when I'm out.
- No, you won't.

03:31.527 --> 03:34.012
Your phone's not gonna
be on for three days.

03:34.030 --> 03:35.681
What?!

03:35.715 --> 03:37.866
It's gonna be back on
on Wednesday.

03:37.901 --> 03:39.952
The phone company
messed up. I'm sorry.

Vega.

03:51.214 --> 03:53.749
Those prints come back?

03:53.800 --> 03:55.033
You asking me, Detective?

03:55.051 --> 03:56.969
Mike, glad you could make it.

03:57.003 --> 03:59.054
Len's waiting on us;
the prints came back.

04:10.817 --> 04:11.934
Really?

04:16.105 --> 04:18.273
They originally made it
for the astronauts.

04:18.308 --> 04:21.059
I'm telling you, I sleep
like the dead in this thing.

04:21.077 --> 04:23.198
I'm not spending half my
pension on a mattress.

04:23.199 --> 04:23.728
Half?

04:23.746 --> 04:25.831
We're talking about
an astronaut bed, man.

04:25.865 --> 04:28.250
I'm pretty sure I spent
my whole pension

04:28.284 --> 04:30.285
and probably a
little of yours.

04:31.287 --> 04:33.422
What?

04:33.456 --> 04:36.008
Well, first of all,
there's coffee in it.

04:36.042 --> 04:37.342
Look, Len...

04:37.377 --> 04:38.743
I dropped the
thing, okay?

04:38.761 --> 04:41.913
- No. There's also a ring missing.
- What?

04:41.931 --> 04:43.932
Yeah, there's one...

04:43.967 --> 04:46.309
two-fingered brass knuckle ring,

04:46.310 --> 04:49.529
with the word "WILD"
inscribed on the top.

04:49.530 --> 04:51.139
Look. No, no, no, no.

04:51.190 --> 04:53.608
See, I picked everything up
and put it all back in here.

04:53.643 --> 04:54.643
I made sure.

04:54.694 --> 04:55.944
This is why I tell them

04:55.979 --> 04:59.481
not to let you guys take it
out of the property room.

04:59.532 --> 05:01.700
Do me a favor... it's
a ten-cent knockoff.

05:01.734 --> 05:03.601
It's got nothing to
do with the crime.

05:03.619 --> 05:04.703
Could you do some...

05:04.737 --> 05:06.121
Lenny magic, make it disappear?

05:06.155 --> 05:07.719
Just don't do it again. Okay?

05:07.720 --> 05:10.792
- I owe you a large beer, my friend.
- Y-You owe me a ring.

05:15.381 --> 05:18.050
Never should've got
out of bed this morning.

05:18.084 --> 05:19.801
You know, I had
that same feeling,

05:19.836 --> 05:22.587
but it's 'cause
I was very comfortable.

05:22.621 --> 05:24.723
That astronaut bed... ooh.

05:29.595 --> 05:32.347
Come on...

05:32.398 --> 05:34.893
I wasn't the one who was
too tired last night.

05:34.894 --> 05:35.517
Ouch.

05:35.568 --> 05:37.125
Just eight minutes of
your precious time.

05:37.126 --> 05:39.571
Eight minutes? It takes me eight minutes
to get these clothes <i>on.</i>

05:39.605 --> 05:40.005
Six.

05:40.006 --> 05:41.606
No. You're going the wrong direction.

05:41.640 --> 05:44.359
How about 12 minutes
and a police escort?

05:44.410 --> 05:47.529
And that is my final offer.

05:48.581 --> 05:49.998
How about lunch?

05:51.195 --> 05:52.534
- Lunch?
- Yeah.

05:52.585 --> 05:54.619
Sure.

05:54.653 --> 05:55.704
All right.

05:55.755 --> 05:58.457
But tomorrow we stay
in bed all day. Deal?

05:58.491 --> 05:59.958
Deal.

06:04.714 --> 06:07.215
There was totally a sign there,
and you blew right through it.

06:07.266 --> 06:08.433
There was no sign.

06:08.468 --> 06:10.519
- Let's go back.
- I'm eating.

06:10.553 --> 06:11.887
Because you know
it was a stop sign.

06:11.938 --> 06:12.328
No.

06:12.329 --> 06:15.223
When we get to the station,
I'm gonna write you a ticket.

06:15.274 --> 06:16.224
All units, Code 3.

06:16.275 --> 06:17.675
Possible hostage situation.

06:17.693 --> 06:19.394
Vista Psychiatric Hospital.

06:19.445 --> 06:21.396
11347 Vista Heights.

06:21.447 --> 06:23.115
Seven William 43 and 45,

06:23.149 --> 06:24.366
responding Code 3.

06:24.400 --> 06:27.052
Come on. It's okay. Come.

06:31.991 --> 06:33.458
What's up?

06:33.493 --> 06:36.128
Guy claims to have the whole
place wired with explosives.

06:36.162 --> 06:37.629
He's got himself
barricaded in there

06:37.663 --> 06:39.998
with about 15 other patients,
doctors and nurses.

06:40.032 --> 06:41.967
We've set up a perimeter and
already started evacuation.

06:42.001 --> 06:43.085
This is the head
nurse in charge.

06:43.136 --> 06:44.369
He is a patient.

06:44.387 --> 06:46.588
His name's, uh,
Gabriel Wyath.

06:46.639 --> 06:49.308
He just started screaming he was
gonna blow the whole place up,

06:49.309 --> 06:51.810
and then he locked down the
high-risk wing from the inside.

06:51.844 --> 06:53.812
You see these explosives?
They look real to you?

06:53.846 --> 06:55.597
He's got a bunch
of acetylene tanks

06:55.648 --> 06:57.048
with wires sticking
out of them.

06:57.066 --> 06:58.183
Detective,

06:58.217 --> 06:59.384
- he's on the phone.
- Who?

06:59.402 --> 07:00.435
The patient.

07:00.486 --> 07:02.070
He wants to talk to
whoever's in charge.

07:02.105 --> 07:04.106
You're the senior
officer.

07:05.358 --> 07:08.193
This is Detective Britten.

07:08.227 --> 07:09.394
Who am I talking to?

07:09.412 --> 07:10.695
It's Gabe. Okay. It's Gabe.

07:10.729 --> 07:12.831
You have to stop the noises.
Stop the sirens. Okay?

07:12.865 --> 07:15.917
I can't hear my thoughts and I need
to hear what I'm thinking or...

07:15.952 --> 07:17.102
Okay, Gabe.

07:17.136 --> 07:19.421
Hold on a second.
I'll see what I can do.

07:19.455 --> 07:21.423
Let's have all units
respond Code 2.

07:22.542 --> 07:24.509
Seven William 45,

07:24.544 --> 07:26.111
have all units
respond Code 2.

07:28.247 --> 07:31.366
Hold on a second, Gabe.

07:33.653 --> 07:35.103
All right. How's that?

07:35.138 --> 07:36.638
Gabe, is that any better?

07:36.689 --> 07:38.440
Yeah.

07:38.474 --> 07:40.442
Thank you.

07:40.476 --> 07:41.810
Thank you. N-Now,

07:41.861 --> 07:43.395
which one are you?

07:43.429 --> 07:45.280
Raise your hand.

07:48.034 --> 07:51.069
That's me.

07:51.103 --> 07:52.237
Right here.

07:52.271 --> 07:53.538
You got me?

07:53.573 --> 07:54.823
I see you.

07:54.857 --> 07:56.541
You look okay.

07:56.576 --> 07:58.293
Thanks.

07:58.327 --> 07:59.628
All right, Gabe, listen.

07:59.662 --> 08:01.192
Here's what I need you to do:

08:01.193 --> 08:04.833
I need you to let all those people
you're holding walk out of here.

08:04.884 --> 08:05.917
No! No!

08:05.951 --> 08:08.587
Don't, don't... Hold on.

08:08.621 --> 08:10.505
I tell you what I need. Okay?

08:10.556 --> 08:12.090
That's how this works. Okay?

08:12.124 --> 08:13.958
- That's how it works! Okay?
- All right.

08:13.976 --> 08:16.061
All right, Gabe. I'm sorry.

08:16.095 --> 08:18.180
So, what do you need?

08:18.231 --> 08:20.849
I need you
to bring me my sister.

08:20.883 --> 08:23.268
Okay? I know they have her.

08:23.302 --> 08:25.103
I know all about it. Okay?

08:25.137 --> 08:27.189
I-I just need to see her...

08:27.240 --> 08:30.108
talk to her. Okay?

08:30.142 --> 08:31.476
I-I just need to...

08:31.494 --> 08:33.328
to see her.

08:33.361 --> 08:34.361
All right, Gabe.

08:34.413 --> 08:35.830
Give me a little time and...

08:35.865 --> 08:37.198
Gabe?

08:40.753 --> 08:42.337
What did he say?

08:42.371 --> 08:43.755
He wants to see his sister.

08:43.789 --> 08:45.840
Christy.

08:45.875 --> 08:48.677
- You know where I can find her?
- You can't.

08:48.711 --> 08:51.096
She was murdered about
four years ago.

08:53.132 --> 08:55.383
Great.

08:56.969 --> 08:59.137
We estimate
there are 25 hostages.

08:59.171 --> 09:00.605
He's got them
locked behind

09:00.640 --> 09:01.940
these sally port doors, here.

09:01.974 --> 09:03.275
Here we go.

09:03.309 --> 09:04.726
Everyone, this is Dr. Lee.

09:04.760 --> 09:06.809
He's worked with the
patient extensively.

09:06.810 --> 09:09.698
We're just trying to get a thumbnail
of what we're dealing with here.

09:11.150 --> 09:13.702
Well, what we're dealing with
is a very intelligent

09:13.736 --> 09:15.820
and very troubled
individual.

09:15.855 --> 09:17.038
Gabe...

09:17.073 --> 09:18.907
was actually a rising star

09:18.958 --> 09:20.292
in a government
research lab

09:20.326 --> 09:21.826
when his condition started
to become apparent.

09:21.860 --> 09:23.878
He lived with his
sister, Christy,

09:23.913 --> 09:25.747
until four years ago
when she was murdered

09:25.798 --> 09:28.500
in a dispute with an ex-boyfriend.

09:28.534 --> 09:31.783
Gabe responded to her death
by creating an elaborate

09:31.784 --> 09:34.702
conspiracy theory in which
his sister was not murdered,

09:34.703 --> 09:37.776
but abducted by agents from the
lab where he used to work.

09:37.810 --> 09:39.578
Despite our best
efforts, he's...

09:39.612 --> 09:41.730
he's grown increasingly
delusional.

09:41.764 --> 09:43.214
Doctor, bottom line:

09:43.232 --> 09:46.184
Is this a guy we're gonna
be able to reason with?

09:46.218 --> 09:49.237
As long as he's allowing
his actions to be dictated

09:49.272 --> 09:51.523
by things only he sees or hears,

09:51.557 --> 09:53.575
it's unlikely.

09:53.609 --> 09:55.410
Very well.

09:55.444 --> 09:57.245
This is a high security
building.

09:57.280 --> 09:59.531
Apparently, Gabe has
overtaken the command room.

09:59.565 --> 10:02.167
So, he can use all the measures
designed to keep the patients in

10:02.201 --> 10:03.368
to keep us out.

10:03.402 --> 10:04.586
Realistically,

10:04.620 --> 10:07.505
we're looking at 12 to 14
hours to try a full breach.

10:07.540 --> 10:09.758
Our only immediate option
is to try sniping him

10:09.792 --> 10:11.343
through the small western
window.

10:11.377 --> 10:13.578
But if we're gonna
get a clean shot,

10:13.596 --> 10:15.513
we're gonna have to maneuver him
into position.

10:15.548 --> 10:17.098
The negotiator's trying
to work out a trade

10:17.133 --> 10:18.466
to get one of
our guys inside.

10:18.501 --> 10:19.784
See if we can't...

10:19.819 --> 10:21.803
- direct him.
- He won't let anyone out,

10:21.837 --> 10:23.021
but he's agreed
to let someone in

10:23.055 --> 10:24.222
that can help him
find his sister.

10:24.256 --> 10:26.524
- We can work with that.
- There's one complication.

10:26.559 --> 10:28.259
He's saying he will
only take the officer

10:28.277 --> 10:29.628
who helped him with the noise.

10:29.662 --> 10:32.030
- Detective Britten.
- Absolutely not.

10:33.766 --> 10:36.401
How else are you
gonna take the shot?

10:41.240 --> 10:41.764
Once you're in,

10:41.765 --> 10:43.792
ease him toward the west side
of the drinking fountain.

10:43.826 --> 10:45.243
That's where we've
got the best shot.

10:47.279 --> 10:48.880
Excuse me.

10:48.914 --> 10:50.215
Honey.

10:50.249 --> 10:51.383
Babe.

10:51.417 --> 10:53.112
<i>I know you're gonna think I'm crazy;</i>

10:53.113 --> 10:55.136
<i>what if we try that
Lebanese place again?</i>

10:55.171 --> 10:56.755
No, I can't.

10:56.789 --> 10:57.955
I know, but they say

10:57.973 --> 10:59.557
that the lamb's gotten
so much better.

10:59.592 --> 11:03.395
No, no, I mean,
a situation came up at work.

11:03.429 --> 11:05.847
I... I got to take a rain check.

11:07.800 --> 11:10.068
Okay, well, what about dinner?

11:10.102 --> 11:11.653
<i>Dinner would be great.</i>

11:17.526 --> 11:19.327
You know that I love you, right?

11:21.364 --> 11:22.997
Yeah, I love you, too, babe.

11:23.032 --> 11:24.699
I'll see you tonight, all right?

11:27.753 --> 11:29.254
See ya.

12:15.335 --> 12:17.241
<i>...not
have been evacuated,</i>

12:17.242 --> 12:20.099
<i>which all over a dozen people that
remain inside this building.</i>

12:20.134 --> 12:23.219
<i>Apparently, one officer
has been admitted in</i>

12:23.253 --> 12:25.638
<i>and is attempting
to reason with Wyath.</i>

12:25.689 --> 12:27.757
<i>no comment.</i>

12:27.775 --> 12:29.275
<i>We don't know
what his demands are.</i>

12:29.310 --> 12:31.728
<i>No stranger though, this man,
to this sort of violence,</i>

12:31.762 --> 12:33.279
<i>Wyath was arrested in late 2008</i>

12:33.314 --> 12:35.565
<i>when he entered
a municipal building</i>

12:35.599 --> 12:38.484
<i>with explosives
strapped to his body.</i>

12:38.536 --> 12:40.486
<i>Shortly after this,
he was transferred</i>

12:40.538 --> 12:42.104
<i>to the high-security wing
of this facility...</i>

12:45.209 --> 12:46.776
<i>This is
Detective Michael Britten.</i>

12:46.794 --> 12:47.994
<i>Please leave me a message,</i>

12:48.028 --> 12:49.796
<i>and I'll call you back
as soon as I can.</i>

12:55.870 --> 12:57.119
Vega.

12:57.137 --> 12:59.222
Efram...

12:59.256 --> 13:02.458
y-you're not at this hospital
scene I'm watching on TV, right?

13:02.476 --> 13:03.459
Okay, listen to me...

13:03.477 --> 13:04.293
Where is he?

13:04.311 --> 13:05.979
Where's-where's-where's Michael?

13:06.013 --> 13:09.399
We had a situation,
and he didn't want you to worry.

13:10.851 --> 13:13.403
My God. My God!

13:58.449 --> 13:59.949
Sh-Show me you're clean.

14:04.238 --> 14:05.872
I got nothing on me, Gabe.

14:05.906 --> 14:07.357
Just like you told me.

14:10.995 --> 14:12.295
Okay?

14:12.329 --> 14:14.196
So let's stay calm.

14:14.214 --> 14:15.248
Just sit down.

14:23.590 --> 14:25.541
What did they tell you?

14:25.559 --> 14:30.847
They told me to come in here
and help you find your sister

14:30.881 --> 14:33.232
and bring her to see you.

14:33.267 --> 14:37.353
Did they tell you
that I'm making it up?

14:37.388 --> 14:40.273
Because that's
how they dismiss you.

14:40.307 --> 14:42.275
How they try to get rid of you.

14:42.326 --> 14:45.628
Yeah, they did.

14:50.668 --> 14:53.920
I'm not imagining things.

15:00.260 --> 15:02.679
My sister is real,

15:02.713 --> 15:04.113
and she's alive,

15:04.148 --> 15:07.967
and whatever they told you,
she doesn't deserve this.

15:12.222 --> 15:15.358
She's the only one
that ever understood.

15:15.392 --> 15:17.393
When they tried to

15:17.428 --> 15:19.612
split us up, take me away

15:19.646 --> 15:22.065
because they said
that I was sick,

15:22.099 --> 15:24.000
that I wanted
to hurt people,

15:24.034 --> 15:26.119
she wouldn't let them.

15:26.153 --> 15:29.038
She fought them, and instead
of letting them haul me off

15:29.073 --> 15:32.041
to a place like this...

15:34.078 --> 15:36.813
...she took me to one like this.

15:44.287 --> 15:45.722
She looks nice.

15:45.756 --> 15:48.725
She protected me.

15:48.759 --> 15:51.260
I let them take her.

15:52.896 --> 15:54.680
I should have protected her.

15:56.700 --> 15:59.468
And I didn't.

15:59.486 --> 16:01.437
But now I need,
I need to get her.

16:01.471 --> 16:02.739
I need to get her back.

16:02.773 --> 16:05.525
And that, that's what
makes me sick?

16:07.561 --> 16:11.180
Don't you think I would be crazy
if I <i>wasn't</i> trying to save her?

16:11.215 --> 16:13.199
Yes.

16:15.619 --> 16:18.704
Look.

16:18.739 --> 16:19.705
Look at this.

16:19.757 --> 16:21.674
No! No, no, no! No!

16:21.708 --> 16:23.159
No!

16:23.177 --> 16:25.762
Okay. They think that I
can't see through this?

16:25.796 --> 16:27.296
I mean, but it's
practically obvious.

16:27.330 --> 16:28.131
Gabe,

16:28.165 --> 16:30.850
can I ask you something?

16:30.884 --> 16:32.301
What is that in your hand?

16:32.336 --> 16:34.270
I know you're there!

16:34.304 --> 16:35.805
This?

16:35.839 --> 16:36.806
Yeah.

16:36.840 --> 16:38.107
This is a dead
man's switch.

16:38.142 --> 16:41.694
It's what triggers the bombs,
Detective.

16:41.728 --> 16:45.148
I let go...

16:45.182 --> 16:46.532
boom.

16:47.985 --> 16:50.403
It's how I'm gonna
keep them honest.

16:55.776 --> 16:57.794
As long as I don't let go,

16:57.828 --> 16:59.228
everything's fine.

16:59.263 --> 17:01.080
But if they try something...

17:01.131 --> 17:02.415
No!

17:02.449 --> 17:04.333
No!

17:06.368 --> 17:08.137
Excuse me.

17:08.172 --> 17:10.589
This is how we'll find her?

17:10.641 --> 17:12.842
This map?

17:14.711 --> 17:17.762
That's where Dr. Wilde has her.

17:19.817 --> 17:21.184
Dr. Wilde?

17:21.218 --> 17:22.568
Two-fingered brass knuckle ring

17:22.603 --> 17:24.569
with the word "WILD"
inscribed on the top.

17:26.440 --> 17:27.406
He's holding her.

17:27.441 --> 17:31.027
He's got her in this secret
underground location.

17:31.061 --> 17:34.580
They think that she's gonna
talk about my research,

17:34.615 --> 17:37.934
but I keep telling them
that she doesn't know anything.

17:37.968 --> 17:39.869
But they won't even admit
that they have her.

17:39.903 --> 17:43.589
How can you reason with someone
when-when they say that

17:43.624 --> 17:46.459
she's not even alive?

17:46.510 --> 17:47.793
Right.

17:47.845 --> 17:49.545
Will you shut up!

17:49.579 --> 17:51.547
I'm trying to tell him
where Christy is!

17:52.582 --> 17:53.799
Shut up!

17:53.851 --> 17:55.268
Please.

17:56.220 --> 17:57.436
Shut up!

18:00.824 --> 18:02.525
Shut up!

18:02.559 --> 18:04.527
- I said, shut up!
- No! No! No!

18:04.561 --> 18:05.528
No!

18:05.562 --> 18:06.562
Get away from
the window!

18:08.582 --> 18:11.150
Sierra One,
I have visual on suspect.

18:11.185 --> 18:13.970
You got a
green light on the shot.

18:14.004 --> 18:15.655
Shut up!

18:17.574 --> 18:18.875
Let go!
No, Gabe.

18:18.909 --> 18:20.293
Calm down.

18:20.327 --> 18:21.627
You tried to kill me!

18:21.662 --> 18:22.962
No, no, I'm trying
to help you!

18:22.996 --> 18:24.247
The switch...

18:24.281 --> 18:25.498
I can pull the wire
from the transceiver,

18:25.549 --> 18:27.166
and it's the same thing
as letting go of the button!

18:27.217 --> 18:28.668
- Don't-don't do any...
- Do you want me to do that?!

18:28.719 --> 18:30.086
- No, no, no. Okay, I'm not touching it.
- Let go!

18:30.120 --> 18:31.087
Get away!

18:31.121 --> 18:32.088
Shh-shh-shh.

18:32.122 --> 18:33.256
Stand up!

18:33.290 --> 18:34.974
All right,
let's just calm down, okay?

18:35.008 --> 18:35.975
Gabe?

18:36.009 --> 18:37.310
Turn around!

18:37.344 --> 18:38.477
Okay.

18:38.512 --> 18:41.264
I need you to stay calm, Gabe.

18:41.298 --> 18:43.599
If we're gonna
try and help you...

18:43.633 --> 18:44.734
Shut up!

18:44.768 --> 18:46.018
I can't think!

18:46.069 --> 18:48.104
I can't have you causing
this kind of trouble.

18:48.138 --> 18:51.240
All right, let's just slow
everything down, okay, Gabe?

19:06.256 --> 19:07.340
Gabe!

19:07.374 --> 19:09.008
Let us out of here!

19:09.042 --> 19:11.427
Gabe! Gabe!

19:11.461 --> 19:12.461
No!

19:12.495 --> 19:14.096
Come over here
and talk to me!

19:15.332 --> 19:16.799
Gabe, don't!

19:16.833 --> 19:18.200
That'll kill him!

19:18.235 --> 19:19.518
Gabe, don't do it!

19:20.887 --> 19:22.805
No, Gabe!

19:50.067 --> 19:52.068
It's me.

19:54.739 --> 19:56.823
That missing ring turn up?

19:56.874 --> 19:58.491
The one that said "WILD"?

19:58.542 --> 20:00.543
Sorry.

20:09.192 --> 20:11.443
Your dad didn't notice
you carrying two bowls?

20:11.941 --> 20:15.443
I don't think he would have
noticed if I'd had two heads.

20:17.795 --> 20:19.746
He's acting weird lately.

20:19.797 --> 20:21.248
Why?

20:21.299 --> 20:22.916
Why? I don't know.

20:22.967 --> 20:24.635
You don't ask?

20:24.669 --> 20:27.638
It's none of my business.

20:27.672 --> 20:29.556
Sure it is.

20:29.590 --> 20:32.542
He could be
getting fired.

20:32.560 --> 20:34.377
Or, I don't know,
he has a tumor.

20:34.395 --> 20:35.979
Or he could have
an eating disorder.

20:36.014 --> 20:37.764
He doesn't have
an eating disorder.

20:37.815 --> 20:38.982
No?

20:39.017 --> 20:40.817
How would you know
if you don't ask?

20:43.187 --> 20:45.939
We just... don't talk
about stuff like that.

20:45.990 --> 20:48.391
Would you know if your parents
had an eating disorder?

20:49.861 --> 20:51.244
Totally.

20:51.279 --> 20:52.863
We practically tell
each other everything.

20:52.897 --> 20:54.364
Yeah?...

20:54.398 --> 20:56.249
Where do they think
you slept last night?

20:58.286 --> 20:59.619
In your bed.

21:04.575 --> 21:06.793
You're serious.

21:06.844 --> 21:09.412
Yeah.

21:09.430 --> 21:10.931
They practice
progressive parenting.

21:10.965 --> 21:13.433
As long as I tell them
the truth, they trust me.

21:13.468 --> 21:15.585
They must want to kill me.

21:15.603 --> 21:16.853
No.

21:16.888 --> 21:18.889
They'd be more mad at
you if they found out

21:18.923 --> 21:20.273
you were
giving me this.

21:20.308 --> 21:21.858
A lot of
processed sugar.

21:21.893 --> 21:23.977
So you're allowed to sleep over
at your boyfriend's,

21:24.028 --> 21:25.445
but you can't have
Cap'n Crunch?

21:27.315 --> 21:30.484
Progressive parenting.

21:32.320 --> 21:34.437
See if the cleaning crew
found the ring, will you?

21:34.455 --> 21:35.422
No need.

21:35.456 --> 21:36.990
Guy pled guilty this morning.

21:37.041 --> 21:38.208
Case closed.

21:38.242 --> 21:39.659
Really? You sure?

21:39.711 --> 21:41.478
<i>Yeah. He took 18 months.</i>

21:41.512 --> 21:44.548
After that, well, I'm sure
he'll be a model citizen.

21:44.582 --> 21:45.882
There's something wrong there.

21:45.917 --> 21:47.417
We got to find the ring.

21:47.451 --> 21:50.220
Need to find it? Why?

21:50.254 --> 21:51.621
I mean, you said yourself

21:51.639 --> 21:53.140
it's not important
to the case, okay?

21:53.174 --> 21:55.175
We got enough real work here.

21:55.226 --> 21:56.643
I don't need you
out there hunting,

21:56.677 --> 21:57.844
looking around
for cheap jewelry.

21:57.895 --> 21:59.295
Now, if you feel bad,

21:59.313 --> 22:01.264
you can send the guy
a carton of cigarettes.

22:01.299 --> 22:03.517
Look, can you ask them
to keep looking?

22:03.551 --> 22:07.187
Okay, look, I'll ask 'em,
all right?

22:13.111 --> 22:15.178
Mike, you still there?

22:16.330 --> 22:17.814
Yeah.

22:17.832 --> 22:19.833
So when you coming in?

22:23.487 --> 22:26.840
No, I, I got to stop
and see someone first.

22:26.874 --> 22:30.177
<i>Tell me about psychiatric</i>
<i>drugs, the kind you inject.</i>

22:30.211 --> 22:32.679
Something that might
cause hallucinations.

22:32.713 --> 22:36.833
An anesthetic like ketamine,
for instance,

22:36.851 --> 22:39.870
could have that effect. Why?

22:41.906 --> 22:44.891
The last thing I remember
before I woke up this morning,

22:44.942 --> 22:46.726
I got shot up with something...

22:46.778 --> 22:48.278
maybe ketamine.

22:48.312 --> 22:49.446
I don't understand how...

22:49.480 --> 22:51.565
There's this guy,
a mental patient,

22:51.599 --> 22:54.234
he's taken some people hostage
in a hospital,

22:54.285 --> 22:57.654
and I was sent in
to diffuse the situation.

22:57.688 --> 23:03.693
He attacked me and injected me
with something, and-and...

23:03.711 --> 23:05.162
You mean in
your dreams.

23:05.196 --> 23:07.781
I don't know what's
going on now.

23:07.815 --> 23:11.368
Are you experiencing
hallucinations?

23:15.506 --> 23:17.307
No.

23:19.210 --> 23:22.045
This ring that you're missing,

23:22.063 --> 23:24.714
you said that it wasn't
important to the case,

23:24.732 --> 23:27.717
and yet you feel compelled
to find it. Why?

23:27.752 --> 23:31.655
The guy's looking
for a after a Dr. Wilde,

23:31.689 --> 23:35.008
and the ring's got "WILD"
inscribed on it.

23:35.042 --> 23:38.612
I see.

23:38.663 --> 23:40.563
And this psychiatric patient,

23:40.581 --> 23:43.867
what exactly is the nature
of his illness?

23:43.901 --> 23:47.037
He's a schizophrenic.

23:47.071 --> 23:49.906
Would you say that you're
frightened of him?

23:49.941 --> 23:53.576
He's got the building
wired to explode,

23:53.594 --> 23:56.579
and I'm inside it, so...

23:56.597 --> 24:00.750
you know,
so I'm a little bit frightened.

24:00.768 --> 24:05.755
What if I told you that that
sounded like a positive step?

24:05.790 --> 24:10.427
I'd say that's
not exactly how it feels.

24:11.762 --> 24:13.179
Through this
missing ring,

24:13.214 --> 24:16.483
you have linked yourself
with a schizophrenic,

24:16.517 --> 24:20.287
a man who's unable to distinguish
fantasy from reality.

24:20.321 --> 24:23.379
But in this situation you've created,

24:23.380 --> 24:25.775
your own well-being depends

24:25.793 --> 24:27.577
on neutralizing him,

24:27.612 --> 24:29.329
on defeating him.

24:29.380 --> 24:33.967
And on some level, that means
that you've acknowledged

24:34.001 --> 24:37.137
the danger presented when
someone refuses to see things

24:37.171 --> 24:39.005
for what they are.

24:39.040 --> 24:43.459
You're saying I'm dreaming to
tell myself to stop dreaming?

24:43.477 --> 24:46.029
I'm saying,
right now,

24:46.063 --> 24:48.181
it's a missing ring,

24:48.232 --> 24:49.349
<i>it's a permission slip,</i>

24:49.400 --> 24:50.967
<i>it's a phone bill.</i>

24:50.985 --> 24:53.144
But what you're really afraid of

24:53.145 --> 24:55.438
is what all that might point to.

24:55.473 --> 24:59.849
You're having a nightmare about
madness, Detective Britten,

24:59.850 --> 25:01.745
<i>because somewhere inside,</i>

25:01.779 --> 25:06.683
<i>you fear that if you continue to
deny the reality of your situation,</i>

25:06.717 --> 25:08.618
<i>this is where</i>
<i>all that could end.</i>

25:46.080 --> 25:48.214
What are you doing?

25:50.467 --> 25:52.735
You see a ring
around the house?

25:52.770 --> 25:55.271
Like, a two-finger gold thing

25:55.305 --> 25:57.256
with the word "WILD"
written across the top?

25:57.291 --> 25:59.475
No. Why?

25:59.510 --> 26:02.912
It's evidence; I got to find it.

26:04.431 --> 26:06.899
I'll let you know
if I see anything.

26:19.530 --> 26:22.865
Rex! Get down here!

26:26.954 --> 26:28.504
Come here.

26:30.791 --> 26:32.108
Did you take the ring?

26:33.844 --> 26:35.294
I asked you a question.

26:35.329 --> 26:36.646
Did you take the ring?

26:36.680 --> 26:38.798
I, I...

26:38.849 --> 26:41.801
I didn't think
anyone would notice.

26:41.835 --> 26:45.354
It's evidence
in a murder trial, son.

26:45.389 --> 26:47.473
You can go to jail.
I could lose my job.

26:47.524 --> 26:48.774
I figured it wasn't important.

26:48.809 --> 26:50.193
And that's a good enough
reason to steal?

26:50.227 --> 26:53.863
I wanted to give it
to my girlfriend.

26:53.897 --> 26:55.948
Your what?

26:55.983 --> 26:58.401
She likes that
kind of stuff,

26:58.435 --> 27:00.153
and I can totally
get it back.

27:00.204 --> 27:01.787
What girlfriend?
You don't have a girlfriend.

27:01.822 --> 27:03.039
Yeah, I do.

27:03.073 --> 27:04.740
Since when?

27:04.774 --> 27:07.293
I don't know.
A few months.

27:07.327 --> 27:08.911
No. You would
have told me.

27:08.945 --> 27:11.747
You told me about the last one.
The-the, the blonde one.

27:11.781 --> 27:14.467
I didn't. Mom did.

27:17.221 --> 27:19.655
Right.

27:22.626 --> 27:24.594
I know since she died,

27:24.628 --> 27:28.064
you want us to suddenly be,
like, all cool, wher.

27:28.098 --> 27:32.068
But you're,
you're still my dad.

27:32.102 --> 27:33.603
What does that mean?

27:33.637 --> 27:36.606
I don't know. We just...

27:36.640 --> 27:39.442
We just don't talk
about stuff like that.

27:39.476 --> 27:44.580
So you were gonna, what, send me
a wedding invitation?

27:44.615 --> 27:47.366
Look, your mother's
not here.

27:47.401 --> 27:49.368
We don't have...

27:49.419 --> 27:51.087
your interpreter any more.

27:51.121 --> 27:52.421
It's just you and me.

27:52.456 --> 27:54.657
And if we want
to make this work,

27:54.675 --> 27:56.842
we're gonna have to put
some effort in.

27:56.877 --> 27:58.511
I'm-I'm doing my best.

27:58.545 --> 28:00.346
You got to do it, too.

28:00.380 --> 28:02.565
Okay?

28:07.504 --> 28:10.556
So, tell me something
about her.

28:10.591 --> 28:12.808
She got a name?

28:12.842 --> 28:13.809
Emma.

28:13.844 --> 28:16.312
Emma.

28:16.346 --> 28:18.364
She worth stealing for,
this Emma?

28:21.235 --> 28:22.735
I'm sorry.

28:25.455 --> 28:27.356
I'm supposed to see her tonight.

28:27.374 --> 28:29.625
If you want
to get the ring back,

28:29.660 --> 28:31.627
you could, you know...

28:31.662 --> 28:33.246
meet her.

28:38.635 --> 28:41.304
Is it wrong that I still think
it's romantic?

28:41.338 --> 28:44.257
Yeah... a little bit.

28:45.375 --> 28:46.759
But he's gonna get
you something

28:46.810 --> 28:48.427
he has to actually
pay for, right?

28:48.478 --> 28:49.595
Yes.

28:49.630 --> 28:52.265
You kids still wear
those big clocks, right?

28:53.433 --> 28:55.268
I like him!

28:55.319 --> 28:56.686
Why haven't I met him before?

28:56.720 --> 28:58.738
Yeah, Rex, why not?

28:58.772 --> 29:00.106
I don't know.

29:02.392 --> 29:04.944
All right, that's enough
torture for one night.

29:04.995 --> 29:06.165
You're not staying?

29:06.166 --> 29:08.197
No. I got what I came for.

29:08.231 --> 29:09.699
It's nice to meet you, Emma.

29:09.733 --> 29:11.667
It's nice to meet you.

29:11.702 --> 29:14.086
Okay.

29:14.121 --> 29:17.340
Sorry, that's the way
we do it in my family.

29:17.374 --> 29:20.760
It's just, Rex and I are still
at the, the high-five stage,

29:20.794 --> 29:22.428
but we're working on it.

29:33.657 --> 29:36.359
Just wait till
you get home?

30:13.897 --> 30:16.499
Dr. Lee, what are you
doing in here?

30:16.533 --> 30:18.967
They convinced Gabe
to let me in.

30:18.985 --> 30:20.903
You got a pretty big dose
of ketamine.

30:20.937 --> 30:21.987
You'll probably feel

30:22.022 --> 30:24.690
the residual effects
until it wears off.

30:24.741 --> 30:28.310
You'll stabilize in a
couple of hours. Easy.

30:28.328 --> 30:29.612
How is he? What's he doing?

30:29.646 --> 30:31.514
Well, he's been...

30:34.150 --> 30:35.267
What?

30:35.302 --> 30:37.486
What's going on?!
What are they doing?!

30:37.504 --> 30:40.439
<i>Yeah, they're coming in.</i>

30:40.474 --> 30:42.174
They cut the power off.

30:42.209 --> 30:44.377
Means he can't control
the doors or cameras.

30:44.428 --> 30:46.345
Who turned off
the lights,

30:46.380 --> 30:48.080
Turn the lights on!

30:48.115 --> 30:49.665
Turn them on!

30:49.683 --> 30:52.768
Turn the lights on!

30:52.803 --> 30:54.103
What does that mean?

30:54.137 --> 30:56.505
It means SWAT's trying
to find a way

30:56.540 --> 30:58.006
to come in here...

30:58.024 --> 31:01.727
and shoot a man who's wired
to explode.

31:17.399 --> 31:19.617
Why won't they
just bring her to me?

31:19.651 --> 31:21.452
Gabe, I need you to let me
to make a phone call

31:21.486 --> 31:22.470
or they're gonna come in here.

31:22.504 --> 31:24.605
I won't let that happen.

31:26.608 --> 31:29.109
I can still stop them.

31:29.127 --> 31:30.444
Please?

31:33.966 --> 31:36.550
Look, you want answers
to your questions, don't you?

31:36.585 --> 31:39.170
If they come in here
and everybody dies,

31:39.221 --> 31:41.622
then you don't get
any questions answered.

31:41.640 --> 31:43.507
So, please,

31:43.558 --> 31:44.959
let me make a call.

31:56.137 --> 31:57.471
Vega.

31:57.506 --> 31:59.106
Tell SWAT to stand down.

31:59.140 --> 32:00.941
Gabe has a dead man's switch.

32:02.811 --> 32:04.612
- Tell SWAT.
- Stop! Stop!

32:04.646 --> 32:06.914
Let's break 'cause the guy's
got a dead man's trigger.

32:06.948 --> 32:08.916
We shoot him,
the whole place goes up.

32:08.950 --> 32:10.618
Stand down. Stand down.

32:10.652 --> 32:12.720
<i>Everyone hold your position</i>.

32:12.754 --> 32:14.422
For now.

32:14.456 --> 32:17.291
Okay, they're holding.
What do we do?

32:17.325 --> 32:20.828
I-I need you to look
into a couple of things.

32:20.846 --> 32:24.632
Gabe says his sister's
being held by a Dr. Wilde.

32:24.666 --> 32:26.133
Is there anything on file?

32:26.167 --> 32:27.802
Dr. Wilde?

32:27.836 --> 32:30.888
<i>I don't know. I'll check.</i>

32:30.939 --> 32:33.024
And see what you can
dig up on a trip

32:33.058 --> 32:34.725
he took with his sister
just before she died.

32:34.760 --> 32:36.727
Trip? To where?

32:36.778 --> 32:38.145
<i>To a beach or something.</i>

32:38.179 --> 32:40.648
Okay. Thank you.

32:40.682 --> 32:42.128
All right, I'll see if
I can find anything,

32:42.129 --> 32:42.983
and I'll get back to you.

32:44.986 --> 32:46.654
It's gonna take a little time.

32:52.828 --> 32:54.495
You know,

32:54.529 --> 32:58.066
sometimes I see her.

32:58.600 --> 33:01.552
Here, in my room or...

33:01.586 --> 33:04.288
she'll just be beside me
walking down the hall.

33:04.322 --> 33:05.923
I know she's not...

33:05.957 --> 33:08.626
I-I know she's not
really here,

33:08.660 --> 33:12.630
but it just feels so good
to be around her again.

33:15.684 --> 33:18.269
They keep saying

33:18.303 --> 33:21.689
that-that I... see things

33:21.723 --> 33:23.691
that aren't there.

33:23.725 --> 33:25.843
But that's not my problem.

33:26.878 --> 33:29.113
You know what my problem is?

33:29.147 --> 33:33.084
No matter how hard I try,
eventually,

33:33.118 --> 33:37.838
I stop seeing things
that aren't there.

33:39.858 --> 33:41.459
That's why
I had to do this.

33:43.345 --> 33:47.798
I don't want to imagine
seeing Christy any more.

33:47.849 --> 33:50.017
I want it to be real.

33:54.005 --> 33:55.723
All right?

33:59.060 --> 34:00.361
Yeah?

34:00.395 --> 34:03.814
I've got no reference
to Dr. Wilde anywhere.

34:03.865 --> 34:05.533
Not in the lab where he worked,

34:05.567 --> 34:06.817
<i>not where he went to school,</i>

34:06.852 --> 34:08.552
<i>no one he's ever seen
for treatment, nothing.</i>

34:08.587 --> 34:10.704
<i>The only reference to Wilde
in the file at all</i>

34:10.739 --> 34:13.657
is the Wild Rose Cemetery
where Gabe's sister is buried.

34:15.076 --> 34:16.710
He's holding her.

34:16.745 --> 34:22.166
He's got her in this...
secret underground location.

34:23.702 --> 34:25.753
I also don't have anything
about a trip in '07.

34:25.786 --> 34:27.621
<i>All the records say
that at that point,</i>

34:27.639 --> 34:30.975
<i>he was in pretty heavy therapy
and afraid to travel.</i>

34:31.009 --> 34:32.393
All right.

34:32.427 --> 34:34.428
Keep looking.

34:39.300 --> 34:40.650
They're getting
somewhere.

34:40.685 --> 34:43.353
Just need
a little bit more time.

34:43.405 --> 34:44.572
Okay?

35:00.989 --> 35:03.357
Doesn't make sense.

35:03.391 --> 35:05.125
What?

35:05.159 --> 35:07.545
Vega says
there's no way this guy

35:07.579 --> 35:09.931
took a trip in '07.

35:10.765 --> 35:12.516
Maybe that's not
what it refers to.

35:14.386 --> 35:16.036
Maybe.

35:16.071 --> 35:18.138
Did he find out anything
more about Dr. Wilde?

35:18.173 --> 35:20.357
No, Wilde's not the name

35:20.392 --> 35:22.359
of a doctor
holding Christy underground,

35:22.394 --> 35:24.395
it's the name of the cemetery
where she's buried.

35:26.147 --> 35:29.483
There's got to be
something here.

35:32.020 --> 35:35.206
Detective Britten,
this is a huge step.

35:36.691 --> 35:38.358
The fact that he's
taken this detail

35:38.376 --> 35:39.910
and put it into
his narrative,

35:39.961 --> 35:41.912
it demonstrates that,
on some level,

35:41.963 --> 35:44.715
he remembers burying Christy
in that cemetery.

35:44.749 --> 35:46.634
On some level, he
knows that she's dead.

35:46.668 --> 35:49.536
If guided properly, we can
help him to understand

35:49.554 --> 35:52.573
that there is no sister
to bring to him.

35:52.607 --> 35:55.509
We can end
this standoff.

35:55.543 --> 35:58.312
You want me to tell him
his sister is dead?

35:59.714 --> 36:02.483
Isn't that exactly what
you've been doing for years?

36:02.517 --> 36:03.984
It's different
this time.

36:04.019 --> 36:07.488
It's not you telling him,
it's him telling you.

36:07.522 --> 36:11.075
These glimpses
of-of a healthy mind

36:11.109 --> 36:14.411
buried under layers of
delusion and denial are rare.

36:14.446 --> 36:17.898
It's up to us to
properly seize them,

36:17.916 --> 36:19.500
to guide him.

36:19.534 --> 36:20.567
I don't know.

36:20.585 --> 36:21.785
I don't think...

36:23.004 --> 36:24.505
What are you talking about?

36:33.999 --> 36:37.518
All right, look, Gabe...

36:37.552 --> 36:40.287
I wasn't completely honest
with you before.

36:42.474 --> 36:45.025
I do have information
about Christy.

36:49.698 --> 36:51.315
Do you know
where she is?

37:04.329 --> 37:06.814
Since your wife's funeral.

37:06.848 --> 37:09.500
There's no world in which
your son survived the accident.

37:33.024 --> 37:34.842
She escaped.

37:36.861 --> 37:39.163
Nobody was meant to know,

37:39.197 --> 37:41.498
because this place they were
holding her underground

37:41.533 --> 37:42.916
was meant to be inescapable.

37:42.951 --> 37:44.368
Honestly, they thought
it was impossible.

37:44.402 --> 37:46.403
But she did it.

37:49.791 --> 37:50.891
Christy got out.

37:50.925 --> 37:52.059
She beat them,

37:52.093 --> 37:54.428
Gabe.

37:54.462 --> 37:59.099
And-and she managed to leave
a message for you.

37:59.134 --> 38:00.934
And Dr. Wilde, of course,

38:00.969 --> 38:04.171
was trying to keep
the whole thing a secret.

38:04.189 --> 38:05.723
What did she say?

38:05.757 --> 38:08.108
She wanted you to know
that she was okay,

38:08.143 --> 38:11.695
that she was
free and happy,

38:11.730 --> 38:14.398
and she was never gonna let
anyone catch her again.

38:16.101 --> 38:19.570
And she promised
that someday, someplace,

38:19.604 --> 38:22.806
you will see her again.

38:22.841 --> 38:25.309
The last line just read...

38:27.495 --> 38:30.731
"I love you, Trip."

38:40.892 --> 38:42.893
She's okay.

38:45.947 --> 38:48.849
Yeah.

38:48.883 --> 38:50.517
She's okay.

38:57.308 --> 38:59.993
<i>How did you know</i>
<i>his sister called him Trip?</i>

39:00.028 --> 39:01.528
<i>I didn't.</i>

39:01.562 --> 39:04.998
<i>I saw it on the picture,</i>
<i>and his name was</i>

39:05.033 --> 39:08.252
Gabriel Wyath III, so I figured
<i>I'd give it a shot.</i>

39:08.286 --> 39:10.187
I don't understand.

39:10.221 --> 39:12.172
Trip. As in triple.

39:12.207 --> 39:13.540
Nickname for third.

39:13.575 --> 39:17.044
So you had the opportunity to
help this patient see the truth,

39:17.078 --> 39:20.097
<i>but you chose instead</i>
<i>to perpetuate</i>

39:20.131 --> 39:21.765
his denial. Why?

39:21.800 --> 39:23.350
How would he be better off,

39:23.384 --> 39:26.437
<i>thinking of his sister</i>
<i>in the ground somewhere</i>

39:26.471 --> 39:31.091
than-than thinking of her free,
<i>liberated, waiting for him?</i>

39:31.109 --> 39:32.893
<i>Explain to me what exactly</i>

39:32.927 --> 39:37.297
is so great about seeing reality
for what it is?

39:37.332 --> 39:40.767
You've more or less summed up
the reason why

39:40.785 --> 39:44.655
every major religion has
some version of an afterlife.

39:48.626 --> 39:52.913
<i>You built a story about the</i>
<i>costs of living with fantasies,</i>

39:52.947 --> 39:55.249
and you allowed it
to point you back to

39:55.283 --> 39:56.917
all the things that get lost

39:56.951 --> 39:58.919
in the shuffle
between these worlds,

39:58.953 --> 40:02.055
<i>like this relationship</i>
<i>of your son's.</i>

40:02.090 --> 40:03.390
<i>But when you came</i>

40:03.424 --> 40:06.927
face-to-face
with the larger revelations,

40:06.961 --> 40:09.396
you backed down.

40:09.430 --> 40:14.101
You retreated into
a-a scenario where

40:14.135 --> 40:17.604
<i>you save the day,</i>
<i>you play the hero,</i>

40:17.638 --> 40:20.824
<i>win the affection of the wife</i>
<i>you've feared losing,</i>

40:20.859 --> 40:24.344
<i>and the approval</i>
<i>of the therapist</i>

40:24.379 --> 40:26.013
<i>who's expressed doubts in you.</i>

40:26.047 --> 40:29.333
Just like Gabe,
you hold the keys

40:29.367 --> 40:31.685
that will tell you
what's real and what's not.

40:31.719 --> 40:36.123
<i>But for the moment,</i>
<i>you're unwilling to turn them.</i>

40:42.263 --> 40:44.164
What's that?

40:47.685 --> 40:49.169
My God, I
remember this.

40:49.187 --> 40:52.022
You and Mom used to read this
to me, like, every night.

40:52.056 --> 40:54.641
For years.

40:54.676 --> 40:58.462
Gabe didn't need to be forced
into some kind of revelation

40:58.496 --> 41:00.364
for his story to
turn out okay,

41:00.398 --> 41:03.283
so why are you so
eager to do it to me?

41:03.318 --> 41:07.020
Detective Britten,
you are comparing yourself

41:07.055 --> 41:09.790
to a schizophrenic
whose delusions led him

41:09.824 --> 41:12.492
to be institutionalized.

41:12.526 --> 41:16.413
I'd strongly prefer
if we find a way to help you

41:16.447 --> 41:18.415
before you get that far.

41:23.271 --> 41:24.888
Well, didn't you
feel frightened?

41:24.923 --> 41:26.590
Frightened?

41:26.624 --> 41:28.258
Yeah, of course.

41:28.309 --> 41:29.576
Who wouldn't? Didn't you?

41:29.611 --> 41:32.379
Absolutely.

41:32.413 --> 41:34.648
But then, I wasn't inside
like you.

41:34.682 --> 41:36.683
After I advised you
on-on how to approach Gabe,

41:36.717 --> 41:38.252
they put me in this secured van,

41:38.286 --> 41:40.087
in case I could be useful.

41:45.193 --> 41:47.761
Dr. Lee?

41:47.795 --> 41:51.448
<i>But as it turned out,</i>
<i>you did fine without me.</i>

41:54.903 --> 41:56.536
Are you all right?

42:01.742 --> 42:05.078
Yeah.

42:05.096 --> 42:08.815
I'm sorry,
I feel a little... strange.

42:08.850 --> 42:12.319
It's probably the drugs
wearing off.

42:12.353 --> 42:16.273
I think you're finally
making some real progress.

42:16.307 --> 42:20.978
At this point, the best thing
is probably for you to just...

42:21.029 --> 42:23.466
get some sleep.
