<i>The Client List...</i>

00:01.459 --> 00:02.993
Kyle.
Hi.

00:03.027 --> 00:04.394
Kyle just got out of jail.
How's that been going?

00:04.428 --> 00:05.762
Um, he hasn't really
been staying at home.

00:05.796 --> 00:07.297
Your staying here
is temporary.

00:07.331 --> 00:09.132
And so is you
being a father to my kids.

00:09.167 --> 00:10.567
Shelby, you free
for dinner tomorrow night?

00:10.601 --> 00:11.835
Thought you'd never ask.

00:11.869 --> 00:14.004
You never
take your shirt off in here.

00:14.038 --> 00:15.438
You girls
couldn't handle it.

00:15.473 --> 00:17.440
Let's see if he meets up
to the Selena standard.

00:17.475 --> 00:19.342
Is it wrong
that I occasionally imagine

00:19.377 --> 00:21.278
myself alone with Derek?

00:21.312 --> 00:22.412
You're jealous.
Please.

00:22.446 --> 00:23.446
She can't do this,
though.

00:23.447 --> 00:27.117
* Oh, twist it

00:27.151 --> 00:28.852
* shake it, shake it, shake it, baby *
You got the band back together?

00:28.886 --> 00:32.189
Daddy played guitar?
Yeah. He was pretty good at it, too.

00:32.223 --> 00:33.655
This is complicated.

00:33.680 --> 00:34.925
I'm gonna earn my way
back into the house.

00:34.926 --> 00:37.194
I mean, I can take them to school.
It's okay. We have a routine.

00:37.228 --> 00:39.129
Do you let Evan take them?
Don't go there.

00:39.163 --> 00:40.811
I have enough on my plate
with mom in rehab and...

00:40.812 --> 00:41.435
What?

00:41.436 --> 00:43.804
You missed a lot.
I slept with someone.

00:52.547 --> 00:55.115
* if you think you need some money *

00:55.149 --> 00:57.117
* well, honey,
that's just funny 'cause... *

00:57.151 --> 01:01.188
Can you arch your back
just a bit more?

01:01.222 --> 01:04.024
Sure. How's that?

01:04.058 --> 01:05.726
Perfect.

01:05.760 --> 01:07.928
* Go somewhere in the nation,
not in my house *

01:07.962 --> 01:09.396
Yeah, the way
the light hits your hair

01:09.430 --> 01:12.532
with that screen behind you,
it's angelic.

01:12.567 --> 01:15.936
You know, when you said
you wanted something different,

01:15.970 --> 01:19.139
I didn't think
you meant this.

01:19.173 --> 01:23.543
Well, I feel like, uh,
Picasso with his mistress.

01:23.578 --> 01:26.246
I can't believe
I never thought of this before.

01:26.280 --> 01:28.949
Normally, I would do this
from a picture,

01:28.983 --> 01:30.384
but I assume
no photographs here.

01:30.418 --> 01:32.052
Oh, definitely not.

01:32.086 --> 01:35.889
So, is this
just foreplay, or...

01:35.923 --> 01:37.924
How you want to spend
the rest of the hour?

01:37.959 --> 01:41.595
No, the whole hour ... it's
the best money I ever spent.

01:41.629 --> 01:45.899
Okay, well...
you got 35 minutes left,

01:45.933 --> 01:49.202
so knock yourself out.

01:57.488 --> 02:00.207
Whew, am I glad
this day is over.

02:00.208 --> 02:02.743
Yeah.

02:03.460 --> 02:06.295
What are you?
Rose from the Titanic?

02:06.330 --> 02:08.663
Hey!
You know what, Selena?

02:08.699 --> 02:10.500
He is an artist,
and I am his muse.

02:10.533 --> 02:13.669
Yeah, I bet you really help get
his creative juices flowing.

02:13.704 --> 02:17.607
So does this mean
we're back to business as usual?

02:17.641 --> 02:20.276
You done repenting
your sins?

02:20.310 --> 02:21.711
I don't think
I'll ever be done.

02:22.980 --> 02:25.648
I have to make a living.

02:29.086 --> 02:31.578
You're up early.

02:31.579 --> 02:34.347
Well, I got 10 minutes
to get the kids for school.

02:34.381 --> 02:36.349
You know, Riley cuts Travis'
sandwiches in the shape of ...

02:36.383 --> 02:37.584
Trains?

02:37.618 --> 02:39.252
Yeah, got it.

02:39.286 --> 02:42.555
You know, the trick is doing
that every day and not bailing.

02:43.991 --> 02:47.994
It's all right. I got it.
I can clean up my own mess.

02:53.834 --> 02:56.035
So you're really
gonna be a cop?

02:56.070 --> 02:58.738
Well, somebody's got to keep
the bad guys off the streets.

02:58.772 --> 03:01.975
Right, 'cause you're such
a good guy.

03:12.186 --> 03:14.587
Hey.
I'm not late, am I?

03:14.622 --> 03:16.990
Nope. Come on in.

03:17.024 --> 03:18.291
Are the kids ready?

03:18.325 --> 03:19.893
They're just brushing
their teeth.

03:19.927 --> 03:21.227
They'll be out in a minute.
Okay, here are their lunches

03:21.262 --> 03:23.062
and Travis' words
for his spelling test.

03:23.097 --> 03:24.931
All right, I'll quiz him in
the car. I-I made their lunches.

03:24.965 --> 03:28.101
Oh. Okay.
No peanut butter, right?

03:28.135 --> 03:29.536
Honey-banana ...
their favorite,

03:29.570 --> 03:31.137
and I queued up
the goodbye song.

03:31.172 --> 03:34.741
Good.
I'm gonna go get them.

03:34.775 --> 03:38.144
I really appreciate
you letting me do this.

03:38.179 --> 03:41.581
You know, Kyle, we, um,
still haven't talked about

03:41.615 --> 03:43.149
what happened in therapy.

03:43.184 --> 03:45.585
Yeah, and I-I'm not saying
that I have any right

03:45.619 --> 03:50.423
or that it's even logical,
but...

03:50.457 --> 03:52.492
the thought of you
with another man destroys me.

03:52.526 --> 03:53.927
And ...

03:53.961 --> 03:55.261
Daddy! Daddy's here!

03:55.296 --> 03:56.563
Whoo!
Yes!

03:56.597 --> 03:58.097
Hi. Oh, you guys ready
for school?

03:58.132 --> 03:59.332
Yeah.
Bye, babies.

03:59.366 --> 04:00.400
Bye, mommy. Bye, mommy.
Bye.

04:00.434 --> 04:01.601
I'm gonna beat you.

04:01.635 --> 04:06.105
Last one there
is a rotten egg.

04:16.983 --> 04:18.584
All right, buddy,

04:18.619 --> 04:22.589
be only a few more minutes
till school starts.

04:22.623 --> 04:23.923
You want to
run this play again?

04:23.958 --> 04:25.491
Yep.
All right.

04:25.526 --> 04:28.428
"Supermarket."

04:28.462 --> 04:31.798
S-u-p-r...

04:32.967 --> 04:34.934
Hey, come on.

04:34.969 --> 04:35.969
You remember
what the reading tutor said.

04:36.003 --> 04:37.136
You don't need to rush it.

04:37.171 --> 04:39.339
I'll never
be able to do it!

04:39.373 --> 04:41.941
Hey, don't say that.

04:41.976 --> 04:44.477
Let me tell you a story
about your daddy.

04:44.511 --> 04:46.911
When I first started high school,
I was a really fast runner,

04:46.914 --> 04:48.514
but Coach Steff told me
that I didn't have

04:48.549 --> 04:50.216
a strong enough arm
to play quarterback.

04:50.251 --> 04:52.352
So you know what I did?

04:52.386 --> 04:54.053
I practiced every day.

04:54.088 --> 04:56.623
I went into the gym.
I lifted weights.

04:56.657 --> 04:58.391
I got my muscles
big and strong.

04:58.425 --> 05:00.126
And before you knew it, I was
throwing the ball way downfield.

05:00.160 --> 05:02.362
And guess what.

05:02.396 --> 05:04.664
You won the state championship.
Boom.

05:06.233 --> 05:08.468
But I don't have
strong muscles like you, daddy.

05:08.502 --> 05:10.236
But you got
something better than that.

05:10.271 --> 05:12.839
You got a strong brain, and
that's what we're doing here.

05:12.873 --> 05:14.540
We're working out your brain,
right?

05:14.575 --> 05:18.678
So let's do this again.
"Supermarket."

05:18.712 --> 05:23.316
S-u-p-e-r-m...

05:23.350 --> 05:27.420
a-r-k-e-t?

05:27.454 --> 05:29.889
Boom!
That's what I'm talking about.

05:29.923 --> 05:31.524
You know what?
You get one of these.

05:31.558 --> 05:33.760
What's that?

05:33.794 --> 05:36.674
Coach Steff put one of those on my
helmet every time I threw a touchdown.

05:37.031 --> 05:40.166
Come here.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.567
You're gonna do great.

05:41.602 --> 05:43.803
I'm proud of you.

05:46.473 --> 05:49.676
Morning.

05:49.710 --> 05:52.879
Morning, sunshine.
You certainly are glowing.

05:52.913 --> 05:54.280
Well,
thank you, ma'am.

05:54.315 --> 05:55.715
Think that
you could spread

05:55.749 --> 05:57.917
a little bit of that warmth
my way?

05:57.951 --> 05:59.352
Are you feeling okay?

05:59.386 --> 06:00.887
I was just thinking.

06:00.921 --> 06:04.257
Might be fun to go grab dinner
after work one day.

06:04.291 --> 06:06.225
* So keep it coming,
keep it coming *

06:06.260 --> 06:07.627
Okay.

06:07.661 --> 06:10.863
The way that you protected me
from Carlyle,

06:10.898 --> 06:12.265
that was really something,

06:12.299 --> 06:15.601
and I never got to
thank you properly.

06:15.636 --> 06:18.971
Well, that ... that's awfully
sweet of you, but thank you.

06:19.006 --> 06:20.873
Just think about it.

06:20.908 --> 06:25.445
A guy like you deserves to be
something more than...

06:25.479 --> 06:27.880
fun buddies.

06:27.915 --> 06:29.315
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

06:29.350 --> 06:31.951
Yeah, baby!

06:31.985 --> 06:34.153
Y'all are looking at
the proud owner

06:34.188 --> 06:37.156
of a one-of-a-kind
vintage crocodile clutch.

06:37.191 --> 06:40.927
Just outbid my online
purse nemesis, Clutch23.

06:40.961 --> 06:42.762
Someone's
extra chipper today.

06:42.796 --> 06:43.996
You got a problem
with that?

06:44.031 --> 06:45.565
Okay,
retract the claws, ladies.

06:45.599 --> 06:46.999
We open in 10 minutes,
and I have a few things

06:47.034 --> 06:48.635
that I would like to talk
to y'all about.

06:52.039 --> 06:53.106
It's not my client.

06:53.140 --> 06:54.640
Unbelievable.

06:54.675 --> 06:58.678
Hello, we are not open yet.
How can I help you?

06:58.712 --> 07:02.081
Is this
15001 Primrose Avenue?

07:02.116 --> 07:03.683
Yep. It says it
right there on the door.

07:03.717 --> 07:06.919
Sorry, ma'am.
But you've been served.

07:06.954 --> 07:09.055
Oh, my God.
Are these from Kyle?

07:11.859 --> 07:16.329
Selena?
What?

07:16.363 --> 07:18.598
You're married?

07:18.632 --> 07:20.800
Huh?
Oh.

07:20.834 --> 07:23.803
Whoa, wait. Wait. Wait.
You're married?

07:27.114 --> 07:28.067
Selena.

07:28.068 --> 07:30.207
You're married?
Maybe on paper,

07:30.208 --> 07:32.009
but I haven't seen the guy
in like four years.

07:32.010 --> 07:35.179
Uh, you know that "on paper"
is what makes it legal, right?

07:35.213 --> 07:37.181
Legal, shmegal ...
where's the closest Kinko's?

07:37.215 --> 07:38.655
I'll have this divorce done
by lunch.

07:38.683 --> 07:41.519
Yeah, not so fast.
We need some details.

07:41.553 --> 07:42.953
Look, you.
I know that it's juicy.

07:42.988 --> 07:44.154
But you have a client, so...

07:45.357 --> 07:46.957
What?
Is this high school?

07:46.992 --> 07:49.326
Pretty much.
Yeah, I mean, spill it. Who is this guy?

07:49.361 --> 07:51.529
Uh, I met the guy five years ago
at a horse auction,

07:51.563 --> 07:53.564
and, uh,
he won me a horse.

07:53.598 --> 07:56.534
Oh, that's romantic.
Um, no.

07:56.568 --> 07:58.302
Not when you got to
pay for it yourself.

07:58.336 --> 07:59.837
Oh.
Yeah.

07:59.871 --> 08:02.339
He told me he was
some big real-estate developer.

08:02.374 --> 08:03.641
More like a big con man.

08:03.675 --> 08:05.376
Guy didn't have
a dollar to his name.

08:05.410 --> 08:07.375
Yeah, well, that's
a deal breaker for you.

08:07.400 --> 08:08.045
Obviously.

08:08.046 --> 08:09.480
And then, like,
two months later,

08:09.514 --> 08:11.582
I catch him cheating on me
with the girl next door.

08:11.616 --> 08:14.785
Literally...next door.

08:14.819 --> 08:16.420
He's been living
in Fort Lauderdale ever since.

08:16.454 --> 08:18.822
Okay? We good?
Can we get back to work now?

08:18.857 --> 08:20.791
So you feel nothing
for this guy.

08:20.825 --> 08:23.794
Oh. Oh,
I feel something all right,

08:23.828 --> 08:26.797
like kicking his ass in front
of all these nice people,

08:26.831 --> 08:28.966
but you're not worth
ruining a good pair of shoes.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.634
Oh, I guess
you got the papers.

08:30.669 --> 08:34.705
I was hoping to get here first,
give them to you myself.

08:34.739 --> 08:36.974
Why? Hmm?
Why now, Joey?

08:37.008 --> 08:39.143
I met someone,
and she's a really nice girl.

08:39.177 --> 08:42.379
And I want to get married.
Again?

08:42.414 --> 08:44.949
I thought you'd be happy for me
and for you.

08:44.983 --> 08:46.584
It's the girl
I'm worried about.

08:46.618 --> 08:48.385
I mean, what kind of con
did you pull on her, huh?

08:48.420 --> 08:50.387
Hey, Selena,
we have customers coming in,

08:50.422 --> 08:53.457
so why don't y'all
go knife each other elsewhere?

08:53.491 --> 08:55.893
So, a nice girl, huh?

08:55.927 --> 08:57.761
What the hell
is she doing with you?

08:57.796 --> 08:59.430
Why is that
so hard to believe?

08:59.464 --> 09:01.298
'Cause every syllable
out of your mouth is a lie.

09:01.333 --> 09:03.334
That's not true.
Mm. My point exactly.

09:03.368 --> 09:06.637
So, what? You want me just to ...
just to sign the divorce papers?

09:06.671 --> 09:08.272
That's it?
You make me sound so cheap.

09:08.306 --> 09:10.574
Come on. It wasn't all that bad,
was it, Lena?

09:10.609 --> 09:13.510
Don't.

09:13.545 --> 09:15.112
What? This has nothing to do
with Tommy?

09:15.146 --> 09:16.447
What about Tommy?

09:16.481 --> 09:19.083
I ran into him last week.

09:19.117 --> 09:22.286
Yeah, he was, uh...he was
commenting on my fancy Corvette

09:22.320 --> 09:24.622
and complimenting me
on my Gucci.

09:24.656 --> 09:27.257
You know, I should have known
that fathead would call you.

09:27.292 --> 09:29.259
Well,
I don't want your cash.

09:29.294 --> 09:32.463
No, but, um ...
but there's one thing.

09:32.497 --> 09:34.531
I want custody of Henry.

09:46.478 --> 09:48.779
Hey.

09:48.813 --> 09:52.316
Hey, man.
Uh, glad to see you're out.

09:52.350 --> 09:56.153
You have no idea.

09:56.187 --> 09:58.155
Lacey tells me
that you're bunking with Evan.

09:58.189 --> 09:59.823
How's that going?

09:59.858 --> 10:01.558
It's going.

10:01.593 --> 10:03.794
Look, Dale...

10:03.828 --> 10:07.164
You know how sorry I am
about everything.

10:07.198 --> 10:10.000
And I am on a mission
to do right by everybody.

10:10.035 --> 10:12.036
Yeah, so I hear.

10:15.407 --> 10:16.840
I need a job.

10:19.210 --> 10:22.379
You think you maybe have
anything at the trucking company

10:22.414 --> 10:24.348
or the warehouse?

10:24.382 --> 10:26.550
Man, I'll carry boxes.
I don't care.

10:26.584 --> 10:29.386
Um...

10:29.421 --> 10:31.021
Yeah,
I mean, I can try.

10:31.056 --> 10:32.723
Thank you.

10:37.395 --> 10:41.899
You know, I got a job for you.
Grab me my sticks.

10:43.802 --> 10:45.069
Come on,
chop, chop. Let's go.

10:48.569 --> 10:50.225
Is this your drum set
from high school?

10:50.226 --> 10:50.760
Yes.

10:51.572 --> 10:53.639
Is it?
Don't act so surprised.

10:53.674 --> 10:55.702
They're in great shape, aren't they?
Wow. Yes.

10:55.703 --> 10:57.704
Okay, well, this is why
I don't throw anything away.

10:57.738 --> 10:59.272
Lacey makes fun of
"Storage Wars."

10:59.306 --> 11:00.874
Those people know
what they're doing.

11:00.908 --> 11:02.208
Wow.

11:02.243 --> 11:04.144
God, you remember those days?
Oh, yeah.

11:04.178 --> 11:07.347
Me and you ...
the Ring Pops.

11:07.381 --> 11:09.182
Right?
Oh, my God.

11:09.216 --> 11:11.651
We had Lacey and Riley eating
out of the palm of our hands.

11:11.685 --> 11:14.154
One, two, three, four.

11:17.992 --> 11:19.726
Yeah, look at you!

11:23.764 --> 11:27.800
You know, he doesn't give a crap
about Henry.

11:27.835 --> 11:29.402
He hasn't seen him
in four years.

11:29.436 --> 11:32.405
And now he wants custody?
I am the one that feeds him.

11:32.439 --> 11:34.374
I am the one
that bathes him.

11:34.408 --> 11:35.842
I'm the one that
loves him.

11:35.876 --> 11:37.677
Selena, you never
even mentioned Henry,

11:37.711 --> 11:38.845
not even a photograph.

11:38.879 --> 11:40.346
I mean,
can you honestly picture

11:40.381 --> 11:43.483
that irresponsible ass
mucking out his stall?

11:43.517 --> 11:44.884
I mean,
it's ... it's like funny.

11:44.919 --> 11:47.053
Oh. We're not talking
about a kid, are we?

11:47.087 --> 11:49.255
You know what?
We might as well be, okay,

11:49.290 --> 11:51.691
because that horse
is like my baby.

11:51.725 --> 11:53.493
Ooh.

11:53.527 --> 11:55.128
Mean, I love him just
as much as you love your kids.

11:55.162 --> 11:56.663
Well...

11:56.697 --> 11:57.864
Or, you know,
if your kids were like horses.

11:57.898 --> 11:59.532
You know what I'm saying.

11:59.567 --> 12:02.635
That rat bastard ... he's
trying to take him away from me.

12:02.670 --> 12:05.638
Ha!
What did you see in that guy, anyway?

12:05.673 --> 12:09.409
He reminded me of my father.
Don't ask.

12:10.477 --> 12:12.712
Uh, no, we're asking.

12:12.746 --> 12:16.716
Charming, funny...

12:16.750 --> 12:21.521
A lying sack of...
You know what?

12:21.555 --> 12:23.856
Were not doing this.
I'm not doing this.

12:23.891 --> 12:27.527
Can he really
take Henry?

12:27.561 --> 12:30.163
You know, I'm not ...
I'm not sure.

12:30.197 --> 12:33.600
I mean, I guess legally

12:33.634 --> 12:35.969
he's entitled to
half of everything, right?

12:36.003 --> 12:37.437
You know, Selena, you need a lawyer.
Are you kidding me?

12:37.471 --> 12:39.939
Those guys charge
more than I do an hour.

12:39.974 --> 12:41.608
Well,
we have to do something.

12:41.642 --> 12:44.043
Okay, first of all, we don't
have to do anything. Okay?

12:44.078 --> 12:45.878
I mean, I appreciate
your help and all,

12:45.913 --> 12:47.880
but I'm not
one of your clients.

12:47.915 --> 12:51.317
I can clean up my own shit...
And my horse's.

12:57.157 --> 12:59.726
There you go.
Thank you so much.

12:59.760 --> 13:01.728
Hi.
Hey.

13:01.762 --> 13:03.296
Ooh, you brought me lunch?
Yes. Your favorite chicken sandwich.

13:03.330 --> 13:05.164
Oh, and that
good potato salad.

13:05.199 --> 13:07.000
Ooh.
What's in the envelope?

13:07.034 --> 13:09.168
Just a flier advertising your
husband's rock-'n'-roll band.

13:09.203 --> 13:11.170
Wow.

13:11.205 --> 13:13.373
I can not believe
how official this all looks.

13:13.407 --> 13:15.208
It's cool, right?
Oh, that is not going in the window.

13:15.242 --> 13:16.402
Why not?

13:16.427 --> 13:18.473
Kyle Parks on the guitar ...
are you kidding me?

13:18.579 --> 13:21.447
Pick a side, Dale,
and I better be on that side.

13:21.482 --> 13:25.285
Hey. Look,
I'm on Evan's side.

13:25.319 --> 13:28.688
It's just...You can't deny
that Kyle is trying.

13:28.722 --> 13:31.557
Oh, why didn't he try and
be there for his wife and kids?

13:31.592 --> 13:33.693
I mean,
you have no idea

13:33.727 --> 13:35.328
what Riley had to do
to hold that family together.

13:35.362 --> 13:36.896
What are you talking about?
I've been here the whole time.

13:36.930 --> 13:38.464
I know exactly
what she's had to do.

13:38.499 --> 13:41.801
Look, I don't approve
of what Kyle did ... not at all.

13:41.835 --> 13:43.336
But it doesn't matter
what you and I think.

13:43.370 --> 13:44.737
He's Travis and Katie's daddy.

13:44.772 --> 13:46.739
And if he's happy,
that's good for the kids.

13:46.774 --> 13:48.708
Oh, so that just earns him
a spot in your band?

13:48.742 --> 13:50.643
Look,
we grew up with the guy.

13:50.678 --> 13:52.545
It looked like
he needed a gig.

13:52.579 --> 13:54.947
That's all this is ...
a-a jump-start.

13:54.982 --> 13:58.785
He is not the big football star
we all used to look up to, Dale.

13:58.819 --> 14:01.487
You seriously want me
to kick him out of the band?

14:01.522 --> 14:03.721
If you want that poster
in the window.

14:03.746 --> 14:04.357
Wow.

14:04.358 --> 14:07.727
You got to do some thinking.
I suggest you talk to Riley.

14:07.761 --> 14:09.529
'Cause I don't think
I'm the problem here.

14:09.563 --> 14:10.697
Are you saying
I'm the problem?

14:10.731 --> 14:12.632
I'm taking
the good potato salad.

14:12.666 --> 14:14.467
You just gave me
stress hunger.

14:18.439 --> 14:22.709
When you graduate, you're
officially gonna be boots,

14:22.743 --> 14:26.713
which means the only thing
lower than you is shit.

14:26.747 --> 14:29.148
Now, apparently,
I drew the short straw,

14:29.183 --> 14:31.351
and I'm stuck with this group
when you graduate,

14:31.385 --> 14:33.986
so any mistakes
you're gonna make,

14:34.021 --> 14:36.089
make them at your cadet party

14:36.123 --> 14:39.525
'cause tomorrow you are all
officers of the law.

14:39.560 --> 14:43.429
Any questions? Good.
See you all at graduation.

14:43.464 --> 14:44.931
Sir, just wondering,

14:44.965 --> 14:47.934
how do I fast-track
to homicide detective?

14:50.204 --> 14:53.072
24 hours,
and this will be our home.

14:53.107 --> 14:56.008
Pretty cool, huh?

14:56.043 --> 14:58.411
I cannot believe
I made it.

14:58.445 --> 14:59.779
Why? You earned it.

14:59.813 --> 15:01.214
Yeah, I just ...
I've done a lot of things,

15:01.248 --> 15:02.615
but nothing's felt like me.

15:02.649 --> 15:04.450
I mean, I played football
'cause my brother did,

15:04.485 --> 15:07.186
did construction 'cause
my brother did.

15:07.221 --> 15:08.755
This is the first time

15:08.789 --> 15:12.125
I feel like I'm exactly
where I'm supposed to be.

15:12.159 --> 15:15.695
So, it's just the job,
huh?

15:15.729 --> 15:19.065
I thought you graduated
first in our class?

15:23.570 --> 15:25.738
Don't worry, Henry.

15:25.773 --> 15:28.074
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.

15:28.108 --> 15:29.242
We're a team, buddy.

15:29.276 --> 15:30.543
Just if Joey shows up,

15:30.577 --> 15:32.779
do me a favor
and kick him in the nuts.

15:32.813 --> 15:34.414
Yeah, about that.

15:34.448 --> 15:36.849
Isn't he beautiful?
Yes, he is.

15:36.884 --> 15:38.851
Yes, he is,
and he's my number-one man.

15:38.886 --> 15:40.787
Yes, he is.
Well, as the other man in your life,

15:40.821 --> 15:42.422
I'm kind of surprised
your ex-husband

15:42.456 --> 15:43.856
never came up
in conversation.

15:43.891 --> 15:45.258
Well, it's like I said.

15:45.292 --> 15:47.894
It's just paperwork,
wasn't important.

15:47.928 --> 15:49.695
Wasn't important to tell me
that you're married?

15:49.730 --> 15:52.432
Well, why would it be?
We're not playing house, Derek.

15:52.466 --> 15:53.633
We're fun buddies.

15:53.667 --> 15:56.035
You know,
I keep saying that word.

15:56.069 --> 15:57.603
Would you do me a favor?

15:57.638 --> 15:59.318
Would you try and talk
some sense into her?

15:59.339 --> 16:01.874
She seems to love you.

16:01.909 --> 16:03.709
I do love you.

16:05.078 --> 16:07.480
Don't I, Henry?

16:25.751 --> 16:27.306
Hey.

16:27.307 --> 16:29.475
It's late.
Is everything all right?

16:29.509 --> 16:32.401
Yeah, it ... it's more than
all right, actually.

16:32.402 --> 16:33.402
Can I come in?

16:33.437 --> 16:35.638
Sure.

16:35.672 --> 16:37.406
What is it?

16:37.441 --> 16:40.042
I wanted to invite you
to something.

16:40.077 --> 16:43.179
The Ring Pops.
Yeah.

16:43.213 --> 16:45.213
I'm playing a gig with Dale on Sunday.
Wow, really?

16:45.215 --> 16:46.816
I thought maybe
I could get my guitar.

16:46.850 --> 16:49.318
Oh, sure.
I'll get it for you.

16:49.353 --> 16:51.921
Uh, the train sandwiches,
by the way, were a big hit.

16:51.955 --> 16:55.758
And Travis,
he did really well on his test.

16:55.792 --> 16:58.594
Best score ever.
Yeah?

16:58.629 --> 17:00.229
Well, you know, when he slows
down a little bit,

17:00.264 --> 17:02.231
he doesn't mix the letters up
as much.

17:02.266 --> 17:05.067
I think that tutor you got him
is ... is really helping.

17:05.102 --> 17:07.203
Yeah, if we stay on him.
We can do that.

17:09.306 --> 17:10.873
You know,
and I was also thinking ...

17:10.907 --> 17:12.541
I mean,
if it's all right with you ...

17:12.576 --> 17:13.742
I'd like to set up a schedule

17:13.777 --> 17:15.278
for me to bring the kids
to school,

17:15.311 --> 17:18.347
you know, now that I know
the goodbye dance.

17:18.382 --> 17:19.915
Oh, they taught you that.
Oh, yeah.

17:19.950 --> 17:21.550
They got that whole arm motion
down pretty good.

17:21.585 --> 17:23.920
Yeah.

17:23.954 --> 17:26.055
It's nice
to see you smile.

17:26.089 --> 17:27.957
Look.
I know you're busy.

17:27.991 --> 17:31.727
I don't know what you have going
on with work, but it'd be ...

17:31.762 --> 17:34.130
it'd be great
if you could come watch me play.

17:40.470 --> 17:42.371
Are we in the free zone?
The what?

17:42.406 --> 17:44.774
The place where I can safely say
what I feel without getting blasted.

17:44.808 --> 17:46.609
Of course, always.

17:46.643 --> 17:49.445
Good...'Cause I'm not on board
with this whole Kyle thing.

17:49.479 --> 17:51.447
Okay.
You care to elaborate?

17:51.481 --> 17:53.282
I mean, he's only been home
a couple of days,

17:53.317 --> 17:54.984
and he's already
taking the kids to school

17:55.018 --> 17:56.619
and playing
in Dale's band?

17:56.653 --> 17:57.954
I don't trust him,
Riley.

17:57.988 --> 17:59.455
Okay, I'm not asking you
to trust him, okay.

17:59.489 --> 18:01.457
I'm not 100% either,

18:01.491 --> 18:03.826
but I can promise you that
he is not gonna hurt us again.

18:03.860 --> 18:05.461
You can't promise that.

18:05.495 --> 18:07.463
You may not remember what
it was like when he walked out.

18:07.497 --> 18:09.899
Oh, Lacey, I remember.
Do you?

18:09.933 --> 18:11.634
'Cause you were
a complete mess.

18:11.668 --> 18:13.636
It almost destroyed you,
Riley.

18:13.670 --> 18:15.605
Yeah, but it didn't.

18:15.639 --> 18:17.807
Travis and Katie
are the closest thing

18:17.841 --> 18:19.208
that I have
to my own kids.

18:19.242 --> 18:21.811
If he disappoints them ...

18:21.845 --> 18:23.079
Look. I have my doubts,
too, okay?

18:23.113 --> 18:25.748
That's why
he's not staying here.

18:25.782 --> 18:29.752
He's trying,
and I have to give him a chance

18:29.786 --> 18:31.220
to try and make it right.

18:31.254 --> 18:33.689
Well, I think that man used up
all his chances.

18:33.724 --> 18:35.958
Okay, Lacey,
I've got to get to work.

18:35.993 --> 18:37.026
Why don't you go find Kyle,
you know,

18:37.060 --> 18:38.594
teach him
about the free zone?

18:38.629 --> 18:40.763
Why does everybody want me
to be talking to someone else?

18:40.797 --> 18:45.201
I mean, God, it's like I'm never
talking to the right person.

18:45.235 --> 18:46.736
Lord.

18:48.839 --> 18:52.808
Well, aren't you just a handsome
officer and a gentleman?

18:52.843 --> 18:55.811
Come on. Turn around.
Let me get a better look at you.

18:55.846 --> 18:58.314
Thanks so much
for altering this.

18:58.348 --> 19:00.950
I'm so proud of you.
An officer of the law ...

19:00.984 --> 19:03.386
I mean, they don't just give
those badges to anybody.

19:03.420 --> 19:04.620
Well,
I couldn't have done it

19:04.655 --> 19:05.888
without
all you guys supporting me.

19:05.922 --> 19:07.556
Hmm.

19:07.591 --> 19:11.394
So, how are you doing with,
uh, Kyle being back?

19:11.428 --> 19:13.829
That can't be easy.
You have no idea.

19:13.864 --> 19:15.097
Yeah, well,
if it were me,

19:15.132 --> 19:16.666
I would have kicked him
to the curb.

19:16.700 --> 19:18.267
I hope that chair of yours
is real uncomfortable.

19:18.301 --> 19:22.004
Yeah. It's got its lumps.
Good.

19:22.039 --> 19:23.339
You know,
I miss you guys.

19:23.373 --> 19:26.976
Feels like I'm always
training or studying.

19:27.010 --> 19:28.644
Oh, well, I hope
you're having a little fun.

19:28.679 --> 19:30.579
I mean,
you can't work every second.

19:30.614 --> 19:33.249
I am ...
I am having fun.

19:33.283 --> 19:34.450
What is going on
with you?

19:34.484 --> 19:37.286
Are ...
are you seeing somebody?

19:37.320 --> 19:40.656
Oh, my God. You are.

19:40.691 --> 19:43.092
I'm not sure.
Ah, come on. Spill it.

19:43.126 --> 19:44.427
I want her name.

19:44.461 --> 19:46.262
Okay, well,
her name is Shelby.

19:46.296 --> 19:48.864
But, you know, it's ...
it's early, so we'll see.

19:48.899 --> 19:50.700
Well, it's too bad that things
didn't work out with you ...

19:50.734 --> 19:55.538
Yeah, well, you know...
It's ... it's for the best.

19:55.572 --> 19:58.374
I know.

20:00.310 --> 20:02.278
I'm almost done
with my sketch.

20:02.312 --> 20:03.879
Yeah, I can see that.

20:03.914 --> 20:05.848
And then I'll paint it.

20:05.882 --> 20:08.117
You really love your job, don't you?
Mm-hmm.

20:08.151 --> 20:10.486
I actually have my first
gallery showing this weekend.

20:10.520 --> 20:14.023
Your first showing,
Victor, that's...that's amazing.

20:14.057 --> 20:17.526
Yeah. I'm excited.

20:17.561 --> 20:21.564
You seem excited.
Okay, what's going on?

20:21.598 --> 20:24.500
When I quit law, my parents
stopped speaking to me.

20:24.534 --> 20:26.802
You know, my dad's a lawyer.
His dad's a lawyer.

20:26.837 --> 20:30.005
They just couldn't accept that
I wanted something different.

20:30.040 --> 20:32.742
The thing is, I ...
I always imagined

20:32.776 --> 20:34.744
my parents
at my first art opening.

20:34.778 --> 20:36.512
Well,
did you invite them?

20:36.546 --> 20:39.515
We haven't spoken
in two years.

20:39.549 --> 20:41.417
Families aren't easy.

20:41.451 --> 20:44.053
Sometimes,
they're downright disappointing.

20:44.087 --> 20:46.522
Yeah.
You can say that again.

20:46.556 --> 20:48.424
You know
what I've learned lately?

20:48.458 --> 20:51.494
You still got to try.
You should call them.

20:51.528 --> 20:53.596
Maybe.

20:55.098 --> 20:56.699
I'm sorry.
I-I didn't mean to ...

20:56.733 --> 20:58.701
No. I love
that you want to help me.

20:58.735 --> 21:00.536
I just want to finish
this sketch

21:00.570 --> 21:03.706
if that's all right
with you.

21:03.740 --> 21:05.441
Sure.

21:05.475 --> 21:06.776
I'm gonna do this one
in acrylic.

21:06.810 --> 21:08.110
You're not gonna
see my face, right?

21:08.145 --> 21:11.347
I know the rules.

21:11.381 --> 21:16.352
Do you mind if I break
one of my own rules?

21:16.386 --> 21:20.222
I'm not gonna lie.
This isn't good.

21:20.257 --> 21:22.158
He's entitled
to half your marital assets,

21:22.192 --> 21:23.926
including your salary.
Okay.

21:23.960 --> 21:25.561
What about Henry?

21:25.595 --> 21:27.997
It says here he wants Henry
or half of his value,

21:28.031 --> 21:29.832
which is 30 grand.

21:29.866 --> 21:31.233
Wow,
that's a lot of money.

21:31.268 --> 21:32.902
I mean, what is he?
Royalty?

21:32.936 --> 21:35.905
He's off the track, so he's
related to a lot of fast horses.

21:35.939 --> 21:37.373
Okay, so wait a minute.

21:37.407 --> 21:38.874
If Joey's entitled
to half of Selena's assets,

21:38.909 --> 21:40.176
what about half of Joey's?

21:40.210 --> 21:41.610
He claims to be
a real-estate guy,

21:41.645 --> 21:43.045
but hasn't made a dime
in years.

21:43.079 --> 21:45.447
I could have told you that.

21:45.482 --> 21:47.516
All right, so what if
I just, um, refuse to settle.

21:47.551 --> 21:49.351
The guy's
savvier than that.

21:49.386 --> 21:51.353
He applied
for a forensic audit.

21:51.388 --> 21:53.022
What the hell is that?

21:53.056 --> 21:55.925
Opening up all your books.
Joey could clean you out.

21:55.959 --> 21:57.927
I don't got books, all right.

21:57.961 --> 21:59.862
I mean,
just tax returns.

21:59.896 --> 22:01.630
Yeah, and tips.

22:01.665 --> 22:03.199
Since you're
an all-cash business,

22:03.233 --> 22:05.601
anybody could see
that your returns don't add up.

22:05.635 --> 22:07.436
The problem is his next move

22:07.470 --> 22:09.538
is gonna be to look
at your employer's books,

22:09.573 --> 22:12.241
see where
you're getting your cash.

22:12.275 --> 22:15.277
My suggestion ...
give him Henry.

22:18.481 --> 22:20.416
I'll let you two
think about it.

22:20.450 --> 22:22.284
- I'm here if you need me.
- Thank you.

22:24.321 --> 22:25.754
Look, Selena,
we cannot let Joey

22:25.789 --> 22:27.489
get his hands on the books
here at the Rub.

22:27.524 --> 22:28.657
You know that, right?
He's bluffing.

22:28.692 --> 22:30.259
No, not in this case.

22:30.293 --> 22:31.760
He knows that you can't afford
all those handbags

22:31.795 --> 22:33.162
and a Corvette
on that salary.

22:33.196 --> 22:35.164
Look, he doesn't care
about Henry.

22:35.198 --> 22:37.433
He'll sell him
five minutes after he gets him.

22:37.467 --> 22:39.435
Then you're gonna have to find the
money somehow, because if you don't,

22:39.469 --> 22:41.337
you, me, and this place ...
we're going down.

22:53.423 --> 22:54.021
Hey.

22:54.022 --> 22:56.087
Hi.

22:56.088 --> 22:58.810
Raspberry with powdered sugar ...
your favorite.

22:58.811 --> 23:00.412
And yours.
Yeah.

23:00.446 --> 23:03.215
My mama
didn't raise me stupid.

23:03.249 --> 23:04.749
Mm.

23:04.784 --> 23:06.952
Mama, you're shaking.

23:06.986 --> 23:08.687
It's not as bad
as it looks.

23:08.721 --> 23:11.389
Really?
No. It's a bitch.

23:11.424 --> 23:13.024
Yeah, you never were
a good liar.

23:13.059 --> 23:15.594
You and me both.

23:15.628 --> 23:19.231
When did life
get so hard, mama?

23:19.265 --> 23:23.235
One day at a time, sweetheart,
just one day at time.

23:23.269 --> 23:24.603
At least, that's what

23:24.637 --> 23:26.638
these smartass counselors
around here say.

23:32.445 --> 23:34.813
You know, if you ever want to
talk about this ...

23:34.847 --> 23:37.315
All we do around here
is talk.

23:37.350 --> 23:41.486
Tell me about the kids,
and Lacey, Dale, Evan.

23:41.520 --> 23:43.321
And Kyle.

23:43.356 --> 23:46.291
And Kyle.

23:55.935 --> 23:58.737
Uh, hey, Selena.
What are you doing?

23:58.771 --> 24:00.138
You know, this isn't
good for business, right?

24:00.172 --> 24:01.506
I mean,
he can't stay here.

24:01.540 --> 24:03.341
Oh, calm down.
I wasn't planning on it.

24:03.376 --> 24:05.176
That guy's just helping me
move Henry.

24:05.211 --> 24:07.312
There's a stall opening up
in a day or two

24:07.346 --> 24:09.414
at some secret location.
Uh, where is it?

24:09.448 --> 24:11.616
Well, if I told you,
then it wouldn't be a secret.

24:11.651 --> 24:12.751
So you're not
selling him?

24:12.785 --> 24:14.019
Would you sell your kid?

24:15.002 --> 24:16.869
I mean
if your kid was a horse.

24:16.904 --> 24:18.918
Okay, you're gonna have to come up
with the money, plain and simple.

24:18.919 --> 24:20.353
Look, I told you
I can handle it, all right.

24:20.387 --> 24:23.189
I just need to find
this damn bridle.

24:23.224 --> 24:26.226
Oh, good.
Here it is.

24:27.795 --> 24:30.196
Thank God for these bags.
He's got a lot of gear.

24:30.231 --> 24:34.285
Selena, is that a diaper bag?
Yeah.

24:34.286 --> 24:35.067
Took me 12 hours, but I finally
wore down Clutch23 ...

24:35.068 --> 24:37.062
As if she needs a diaper bag.
And you do.

24:37.063 --> 24:38.631
You can never have
too many bags.

24:38.665 --> 24:40.533
Maybe you can.

24:43.637 --> 24:45.938
I have an idea.

24:45.972 --> 24:48.707
Okay, vintage clutch ...
$800.

24:48.742 --> 24:52.945
Ooh, uh,
Hermes h-belt ... $200.

24:52.979 --> 24:54.880
Whoa, whoa.
Are you kidding me?

24:54.915 --> 24:56.549
It's a fire sale.
We have to take what we can get.

24:56.583 --> 24:57.983
I'd just like to point out

24:58.018 --> 24:59.852
that we could be servicing
our customers.

24:59.886 --> 25:01.687
Yes, but by helping Selena,
we're helping ourselves.

25:01.721 --> 25:02.855
Now get back to work.

25:02.889 --> 25:05.291
What's this worth?

25:05.325 --> 25:07.626
Oh, uh, $400?
So 100 bucks an inch?

25:07.661 --> 25:08.861
Ain't that how you charge?

25:08.895 --> 25:10.296
If I was,
I'd be getting $1,000.

25:14.100 --> 25:16.235
Uh, let's hold.

25:16.269 --> 25:18.804
Wait, um, what?
Whoa. Wait.

25:18.839 --> 25:21.407
Wait. Just don't.
No. No. No. Unh-unh.

25:21.441 --> 25:22.508
No. Not this one.

25:24.511 --> 25:28.247
What? I had this
when I lost my virginity.

25:28.281 --> 25:30.850
Your virginity ... oh, so you've
had that since you were 15.

25:30.884 --> 25:32.751
My Rub virginity.

25:32.786 --> 25:34.587
Come on, it's sentimental.
Look, I get it.

25:34.621 --> 25:36.188
It's hard.
But they're just possessions.

25:36.223 --> 25:38.591
You said it yourself.

25:38.625 --> 25:41.238
I mean, Henry's like
your baby, right?

25:41.263 --> 25:42.061
Yes.

25:42.062 --> 25:44.363
Okay, so then what's it gonna
be, Henry or the handbags?

25:44.397 --> 25:46.165
Come on.
You can do this.

25:46.199 --> 25:48.367
Yes!
I just sold my first purse.

25:49.970 --> 25:52.738
Why you all
looking at me?

25:57.944 --> 26:00.579
Hey.

26:00.614 --> 26:02.014
You just missed Evan.

26:02.048 --> 26:04.250
I'm not here for Evan.

26:08.088 --> 26:11.357
We go one round or two?

26:11.391 --> 26:13.692
If I went there,
you'd be K.O.'d in a minute.

26:13.727 --> 26:15.761
Fair enough.

26:15.795 --> 26:18.497
Look.
I'm glad you're here.

26:18.531 --> 26:20.566
I ... if I'm gonna get clear
with Riley, I want to get clear

26:20.600 --> 26:22.201
with you first, and you and I
haven't had a chance to ...

26:22.235 --> 26:24.603
Don't do that.
What?

26:24.638 --> 26:26.071
Get in front of it
like that.

26:26.106 --> 26:28.007
I am running
this free zone.

26:28.041 --> 26:29.875
All right.

26:35.782 --> 26:37.816
I'm ready.

26:37.851 --> 26:40.753
What are you up to,
Kyle?

26:40.787 --> 26:41.887
What do you mean?

26:41.922 --> 26:44.523
I see
Riley warming up to you.

26:44.557 --> 26:47.226
It makes me nervous.
And I don't blame you.

26:47.260 --> 26:49.061
You're looking out for her,
and she's lucky to have you.

26:49.095 --> 26:51.263
Damn straight.

26:51.298 --> 26:53.565
But, Lacey, you have to
understand that I love her, too.

26:53.600 --> 26:55.401
You know,
when you left...Do you ...

26:55.435 --> 26:57.569
do you have any idea
how hard it was to watch

26:57.604 --> 26:59.371
my best friend
break down like that?

26:59.406 --> 27:03.676
I am not proud of what I did,
but I am here now.

27:03.710 --> 27:05.945
Yeah,
and Riley's doing great.

27:05.979 --> 27:07.546
I just don't want to see
you ruin that.

27:10.216 --> 27:13.352
One day at a time.

27:13.386 --> 27:16.889
That's how I learned
to live my life in recovery,

27:16.923 --> 27:18.357
and that's how I plan to

27:18.391 --> 27:20.859
win back the love and trust
of my family,

27:20.894 --> 27:25.331
and that includes you,
Lacey.

27:28.335 --> 27:29.902
I'm keeping my eye on you.

27:29.936 --> 27:33.539
You may be able to charm Dale,
but I'm not that easy.

27:33.573 --> 27:36.041
I'm gonna be watching
your every move like a hawk,

27:36.076 --> 27:39.645
even when you think
I'm not looking.

27:41.681 --> 27:44.883
Okay.

27:51.992 --> 27:54.793
Thought
you could use this.

27:54.828 --> 27:56.328
Thanks.

27:56.363 --> 27:58.964
To Henry?

27:58.999 --> 28:00.766
Mm.

28:06.673 --> 28:11.844
Look ... I know you think
this is, um, stupid,

28:11.878 --> 28:15.681
you know, me being upset
about all this stuff, but...

28:15.715 --> 28:18.684
It's history, you know.

28:18.718 --> 28:23.122
Like, I-I don't know,
baseball cards or jockstraps

28:23.156 --> 28:25.290
or whatever it is
you guys collect.

28:25.325 --> 28:27.359
I get it.

28:27.394 --> 28:31.697
You want to take your mind
off this for a bit?

28:31.731 --> 28:35.134
Um...

28:35.168 --> 28:38.137
You know, I don't ...

28:38.171 --> 28:43.208
I don't think I want to be
fun buddies anymore.

28:45.211 --> 28:47.646
So what,
do you want to go steady?

28:51.751 --> 28:53.952
Hell no.

28:53.987 --> 28:56.955
Relationships
are nothing but trouble.

28:56.990 --> 28:59.892
I mean,
look where this one got me ...

28:59.926 --> 29:05.931
six Louis Vuittons
and four...Guccis lighter.

29:09.402 --> 29:11.203
What we had was awesome.

29:11.237 --> 29:15.074
You don't get a medal
for being unhappy.

29:26.719 --> 29:29.088
So that's Kyle ...
after all this time.

29:29.122 --> 29:31.156
Yeah, that's him ...
up close and in the flesh.

29:31.191 --> 29:33.592
I can see
why you fell for him.

29:33.626 --> 29:36.862
Just promise me
you'll be careful.

29:36.896 --> 29:39.364
I promise.
Liar.

29:42.235 --> 29:43.702
All right, let's talk
about something important

29:43.736 --> 29:45.170
like your wedding.
Oh.

29:45.205 --> 29:47.172
Yes, girl,
let me see that rock.

29:47.207 --> 29:48.674
I thought you'd never ask.

29:48.708 --> 29:51.076
Georgia,
that is beautiful.

29:51.111 --> 29:52.444
That was just about

29:52.479 --> 29:54.213
the most romantic proposal
I've ever seen.

29:54.247 --> 29:55.881
Hey, you know what?
Dale's was charming.

29:55.915 --> 29:59.551
Yeah, if you like your face
plastered across the Jumbotron.

29:59.586 --> 30:02.087
Yeah, go Astros!
Go Astros!

30:16.970 --> 30:18.804
Hello?

30:18.838 --> 30:21.607
Hey, Shelby. What's up?

30:21.641 --> 30:23.709
Why, Evan Parks,
is this a booty call?

30:23.743 --> 30:26.645
What? No.
This is not a booty call.

30:26.679 --> 30:28.881
Really,
'cause it's past 10:00,

30:28.915 --> 30:30.549
and it sounds like
you're at home,

30:30.583 --> 30:32.384
which officially makes it
a booty call.

30:32.418 --> 30:33.986
Listen, I'm about to be
a sworn officer of the law.

30:34.020 --> 30:37.156
It would my duty to disclose
if this were a booty call,

30:37.190 --> 30:38.290
which it definitely is not.

30:38.324 --> 30:39.658
You talk too much.

30:39.692 --> 30:41.960
If you want this,
you got to earn it.

30:41.995 --> 30:44.596
That's why I was calling.

30:44.631 --> 30:48.167
I wanted to take you out
again.

30:48.201 --> 30:50.469
I think
that can be arranged.

30:50.503 --> 30:53.172
Well played, by the way.

30:53.206 --> 30:55.574
This was not a booty call.

30:55.608 --> 30:57.176
You keep
telling yourself that.

30:57.210 --> 31:00.012
Bye.

31:09.556 --> 31:11.957
You coming to hear him play ...
what's that about?

31:11.991 --> 31:13.592
I'm just sitting here
with you two girls,

31:13.626 --> 31:14.960
listening to some music.

31:14.994 --> 31:16.995
Mm. Let's be honest.

31:17.030 --> 31:19.464
This is not just about the music.
He's trying.

31:19.499 --> 31:22.134
I know he is.

31:36.416 --> 31:38.383
Yeah!

31:38.418 --> 31:41.386
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

31:41.421 --> 31:43.622
Beautiful, beautiful.

31:43.656 --> 31:46.158
I'm gonna go see my man.
Go see him.

31:54.767 --> 31:57.369
Well, I'm really glad
you came.

31:57.403 --> 31:59.371
You were great.
Thank you.

31:59.405 --> 32:02.674
I felt like a kid again.
Yeah, me too.

32:04.744 --> 32:08.146
Hey, do you remember that time
in mama's backyard

32:08.181 --> 32:09.548
When we were playing

32:09.582 --> 32:11.250
and you thought you were
Stevie Ray Vaughan?

32:11.284 --> 32:13.685
Whoa, hold ... no. I've never
compared myself to Stevie.

32:13.720 --> 32:15.654
Um, okay,
but your guitar solo was...

32:15.688 --> 32:17.022
It was epic.
Yeah, I know.

32:17.056 --> 32:18.657
I was gonna say
very long and unexpected.

32:18.691 --> 32:21.260
You know who loved it?

32:21.294 --> 32:22.494
Linette. Linette.

32:22.528 --> 32:25.330
Yeah, well,
she had earplugs.

32:26.544 --> 32:28.545
How's mama doing?

32:28.579 --> 32:32.182
Harder than she thought,
but she's gonna get through it.

32:32.216 --> 32:35.018
* Same bed but it feels
just a little bit bigger now *

32:35.052 --> 32:37.520
Yeah, I was thinking about
maybe going to see her

32:37.555 --> 32:39.923
if that would be okay.

32:39.957 --> 32:43.126
Wow, that would ...
that would be really sweet.

32:43.160 --> 32:45.061
Thank you.

32:45.095 --> 32:48.064
I have something for you.

32:48.098 --> 32:50.003
* Just tear me down

32:50.004 --> 32:50.895
Kyle, what is this?

32:50.896 --> 32:52.296
Well, I got a few days
unloading trucks.

32:52.330 --> 32:53.564
Dale gave me an advance.

32:53.598 --> 32:54.865
Okay, this is ...

32:54.900 --> 32:56.400
It's not ...
it's not much. I know.

32:56.434 --> 32:58.636
I just ...
That's not what I was gonna say.

32:58.670 --> 33:04.475
Well,
before you say anything...

33:04.509 --> 33:07.478
I just want you to know that
I'm gonna do whatever it takes.

33:07.512 --> 33:11.749
* That I should have bought
you flowers *

33:11.783 --> 33:14.184
* and held your hand

33:14.219 --> 33:16.186
* should have gave you
all my hours *

33:16.221 --> 33:18.389
May I have this dance?

33:18.423 --> 33:20.925
* When I had the chance
yes.

33:20.959 --> 33:23.227
* Take you to every party

33:23.261 --> 33:27.665
* 'cause all you wanted to do
was dance *

33:27.699 --> 33:30.668
* now my baby's dancing

33:30.702 --> 33:34.872
* but she's dancing
with another man *

33:34.906 --> 33:38.075
* although it hurts

33:38.109 --> 33:40.010
* I'll be the first

33:40.045 --> 33:47.618
* to say
that I was wro-o-o-o-ng *

33:47.652 --> 33:51.288
* oh, I know
I'm probably much too late *

33:51.323 --> 33:54.725
* to try and apologize
for my mistakes *

33:54.759 --> 33:59.229
* but I just want you to know

34:11.293 --> 34:12.380
So, I was thinking about

34:12.380 --> 34:15.783
having some of my cadet buddies
over before graduation.

34:15.817 --> 34:18.619
That's cute. You gonna do
each other's hair and makeup?

34:18.652 --> 34:20.221
Yeah,
something like that.

34:20.255 --> 34:21.856
Anyway,
it's gonna get crowded

34:21.889 --> 34:23.991
and some of the guys
can get pretty rowdy.

34:24.025 --> 34:26.226
I get it.

34:26.261 --> 34:27.783
You don't want your cop buddies
hanging out with the brother

34:27.808 --> 34:29.096
that was arrested on TV.

34:29.097 --> 34:30.364
Do whatever you want.

34:30.399 --> 34:31.799
I'm just telling you
what the plan is.

34:31.833 --> 34:34.802
Yeah, well, looks like
I could use a new plan.

34:34.835 --> 34:37.004
I was gonna get out of here
anyway.

34:37.038 --> 34:39.005
Where are you gonna go?

34:39.040 --> 34:40.674
I'll figure it out.

34:43.545 --> 34:45.913
Is Riley
letting you back in?

34:45.947 --> 34:48.215
Yeah, see,
that's none of your business.

34:48.250 --> 34:49.583
I'm moving on.

34:49.618 --> 34:52.420
Yeah, well,
I'm moving on, too.

34:52.454 --> 34:54.255
I don't remember asking.

35:06.568 --> 35:08.769
I thought
you were moving on.

35:08.804 --> 35:10.771
Not the greeting I was expecting.
Sorry.

35:10.806 --> 35:14.008
Just got rid of
an unwanted visitor.

35:14.042 --> 35:16.544
Should I be jealous?

35:16.578 --> 35:18.612
Definitely not.

35:18.647 --> 35:20.047
Come on in.

35:28.757 --> 35:30.925
You know,
if I didn't know any better,

35:30.959 --> 35:34.128
I'd think
this was a booty call.

35:34.162 --> 35:37.364
If it's the booty calling,
it's not a booty call.

35:39.968 --> 35:41.135
Is that so?

35:41.169 --> 35:42.703
Mm-hmm.

35:42.737 --> 35:45.539
Well, as long as you'll
respect me in the morning.

35:45.574 --> 35:48.476
It is the morning,

35:48.510 --> 35:53.581
and the goal is to respect you
a little less.

35:53.615 --> 35:56.584
* Lay me down
on sheets of cotton *

35:56.618 --> 35:58.586
* whoa, whoa

35:58.620 --> 36:01.989
* you make me feel like
I could fly *

36:04.659 --> 36:08.062
* headlights on the bedpost,
we ain't stopping *

36:08.096 --> 36:09.897
* 'cause Charlie ain't home

36:09.931 --> 36:12.800
* ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

36:12.834 --> 36:15.703
* ooh, ooh,
Charlie ain't home *

36:15.737 --> 36:18.539
* ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

36:18.573 --> 36:21.442
* ooh, ooh,
Charlie ain't home *

36:21.476 --> 36:23.410
* ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

36:23.445 --> 36:25.746
Okay, um, black Prada Hobo...
* Charlie ain't home

36:25.780 --> 36:26.914
...has that box
gone out yet?

36:26.948 --> 36:28.616
Uh, it's right over here.
Why?

36:28.650 --> 36:31.752
New owner's asking.
He just bought the Chloé bag,

36:31.786 --> 36:33.554
so we'll put them both in the
same box and save on shipping.

36:33.588 --> 36:35.256
Where is
the black hobo bag?

36:39.461 --> 36:41.061
Selena.

36:41.096 --> 36:43.097
Really?
Are we still doing this?

36:43.131 --> 36:45.900
What? If these were your
Louboutins, you'd be crying.

36:45.934 --> 36:47.301
Not if it meant
keeping my kids.

36:47.335 --> 36:48.602
Now where's Derek?
I don't know.

36:48.637 --> 36:50.971
Working the Derek magic.
We did it!

36:51.006 --> 36:53.073
Wait,
we sold the last one?

36:53.108 --> 36:54.675
Okay, all right, wait.
What was the total?

36:54.709 --> 36:57.511
It comes to $12,142.53.

36:57.546 --> 36:59.346
Yeah, we're still like...

36:59.381 --> 37:04.818
$17,857.47 short.

37:04.853 --> 37:07.154
It's not over.

37:07.188 --> 37:09.590
There's only 12 grand here,
and I'm entitled to $30,000.

37:09.624 --> 37:11.292
You ain't getting Henry.

37:11.326 --> 37:12.927
Well, then you better
figure something else out

37:12.961 --> 37:14.662
because
this is chump change.

37:18.700 --> 37:19.867
I can't.

37:19.901 --> 37:21.302
Do you want
this deal done or not?

37:21.336 --> 37:22.836
Hey, you know what?

37:22.871 --> 37:25.039
How do you feel about driving
a Corvette there, Joey?

37:25.073 --> 37:28.008
Well, now we are negotiating.
I knew you still loved me.

37:28.043 --> 37:30.010
You know what? You're gonna take
the money and the car

37:30.045 --> 37:32.179
and you're gonna forget
about Henry.

37:32.213 --> 37:34.348
Not so fast. Joey doesn't
disappear that easily.

37:34.382 --> 37:36.550
Hmm.
Kind of like an STD.

37:36.585 --> 37:38.352
I got that treated.
Ew.

37:38.386 --> 37:40.621
My spidey sense tells me
if you're willing to part with

37:40.655 --> 37:43.223
the car and the cash, well,
there's more you're hiding.

37:43.258 --> 37:45.459
Extortion 101.

37:45.493 --> 37:47.461
Yeah, the negotiations
have ended.

37:47.495 --> 37:49.563
Negotiations end
when I say they have, doll face.

37:49.598 --> 37:50.864
Right now,
I'm thinking that maybe my guy

37:50.899 --> 37:52.833
should do a little
forensic accounting.

37:52.867 --> 37:54.668
Maybe he can figure out
how you can afford a Corvette

37:54.703 --> 37:58.205
and all those blingy bags
giving back massages.

37:58.239 --> 37:59.707
You know what?
That reminds me.

37:59.741 --> 38:01.508
I have to call
my client back.

38:01.543 --> 38:03.344
You know, the one that just
happens to be best friends

38:03.378 --> 38:04.678
with the district attorney
in Florida.

38:04.713 --> 38:06.547
Yeah.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

38:06.581 --> 38:09.383
He might be interested in that,
um ... that real-estate scheme

38:09.417 --> 38:12.386
you had going on in Daytona Beach.
He would be interested.

38:12.420 --> 38:14.588
And, oh, he's got a good one in Delray, too.
Whoa, whoa, ladies.

38:14.623 --> 38:18.258
There's, uh ... there's no reason
to roll around in the mud.

38:18.293 --> 38:20.928
Aw, but that's
where the pigs live, Joey.

38:27.969 --> 38:30.371
Well, usually,
I like to be kissed

38:30.405 --> 38:32.373
after being bent over
a sofa.

38:32.407 --> 38:35.242
You know what?
Um, there's one more thing.

38:35.276 --> 38:39.013
I thought you might want this
for, uh, sentimental reasons.

38:40.949 --> 38:43.217
Oh, that's too bad.

38:43.251 --> 38:46.020
That was real high-quality
cubic zirconia.

38:52.694 --> 38:54.061
Well, I'm gonna need
a ride home now.

38:54.095 --> 38:56.263
Yeah.
You've got Henry.

38:56.297 --> 38:57.898
Excuse me, Henry.

39:01.069 --> 39:05.439
Hey.
What are you doing here?

39:05.473 --> 39:07.274
I thought you were supposed to
be at your gallery opening.

39:07.308 --> 39:09.576
I'm on my way there now,
but I wanted to thank you.

39:09.611 --> 39:12.546
Uh, I think
I should be thanking you.

39:12.580 --> 39:14.248
You know, I thought about
what you said

39:14.282 --> 39:15.683
about my parents,
about family.

39:15.717 --> 39:17.518
Did you call them?

39:17.552 --> 39:19.553
I did.
And?

39:19.587 --> 39:20.713
And they're meeting me
in 15 minutes.

39:20.738 --> 39:22.738
Oh! That's so great.

39:22.757 --> 39:25.926
Wait. Here.

39:28.863 --> 39:32.332
Oh, my God.
It's just beautiful.

39:32.367 --> 39:35.335
I had a good subject.

39:38.973 --> 39:45.579
* You won't let go, but you
still keep on falling down *

39:45.613 --> 39:50.417
* remember
how you save me now *

39:50.452 --> 39:55.422
* from all of my wrongs

39:55.457 --> 39:57.257
* yeah

39:57.292 --> 39:59.460
* if there's love,
just feel it *

39:59.494 --> 40:01.895
* and if there's life,
we'll see it *

40:01.930 --> 40:06.100
* this is no time to be alone,
alone, yeah *

40:06.134 --> 40:12.539
* I won't let you go

40:12.574 --> 40:15.743
* oh, no

40:15.777 --> 40:19.947
* if the sky is falling,
just take my hand and hold it *

40:19.981 --> 40:24.384
* you don't have to be alone,
alone, yeah *

40:24.419 --> 40:28.789
* I won't let you go

40:28.823 --> 40:31.425
* won't let you go, no

40:31.459 --> 40:33.794
You want some?
No, thanks.

40:33.828 --> 40:35.796
So, last night,
you and Kyle ...

40:35.830 --> 40:39.633
that slow dance
nearly burned the place down.

40:39.667 --> 40:42.269
Oh, boy. Free zone?

40:42.303 --> 40:44.471
Free zone.

40:44.506 --> 40:45.973
It was really great.

40:46.007 --> 40:48.408
* I won't let you go

40:48.443 --> 40:50.410
Look, I'm not
jumping into anything.

40:50.445 --> 40:53.614
We have a long road
ahead of us, but...

40:53.648 --> 40:56.049
Are you mad?

40:56.084 --> 40:57.885
Of course, I'm not mad.
Okay.

40:57.919 --> 40:59.920
I just
want you to be happy,

40:59.954 --> 41:02.322
and I got your back
no matter what.

41:02.357 --> 41:04.758
I'm just gonna have to take it
one day at a time.

41:04.793 --> 41:06.760
Oh, you talked to Kyle,
didn't you?

41:06.795 --> 41:08.762
I did,
and I know he's trying.

41:08.797 --> 41:12.399
He just better try real hard is all.

41:12.433 --> 41:13.934
All right, who wants
a big dog in a hot bun?

41:13.968 --> 41:15.302
Come see the master.

41:15.336 --> 41:16.737
- Gotcha!
- No, you didn't.

41:16.771 --> 41:19.006
Hey, where's your girlfriend,
by the way?

41:19.040 --> 41:20.474
Shelby, right?

41:20.508 --> 41:24.311
What? Sorry.
Lacey tells me everything.

41:24.345 --> 41:26.146
Girlfriend, huh?

41:26.181 --> 41:27.748
I knew that glow couldn't
just be from the Academy.

41:27.782 --> 41:30.584
Oh, no. She's from the academy,
all right.

41:30.618 --> 41:32.653

your own burgers, all right.

41:37.525 --> 41:39.326
You know what?
This is a good time.

41:39.360 --> 41:40.828

41:40.862 --> 41:42.930

Officer Parks.

41:44.165 --> 41:45.766
Hear, hear.
Yeah!

Criminals out there,

41:51.840 --> 41:55.809
and he will hunt you down
like the dog that you are.

42:01.449 --> 42:03.016
