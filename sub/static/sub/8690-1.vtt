02:24.000 --> 02:28.039
These bad guys are always late.
- They'll be here.

02:28.480 --> 02:31.278
When, Tony?
We've been sitting here two hours.

02:31.680 --> 02:37.118
The meeting's been planned for weeks.
They'll be here. Be patient, alright?

02:37.600 --> 02:41.309
Yeah, so will the Easter bunny,
and my next birthday!

02:41.720 --> 02:44.188
And guess what...

02:45.680 --> 02:47.910
It's about goddamm time!

03:02.400 --> 03:03.674
Got the money?

03:04.120 --> 03:07.430
No, food stamps.
- I don't trust this dude.

03:07.840 --> 03:11.913
I deal in stolen merchandise.
I'm not very trustworthy.

03:12.320 --> 03:13.594
You show up late...

03:14.000 --> 03:17.356
and then you ask dumb questions.
- Could be a cop.

03:18.320 --> 03:23.952
Or Elvis or the Wizard of Oz.
Oo you want to deal or not?

03:29.160 --> 03:31.799
Alright, show him the stuff.

03:34.040 --> 03:36.474
Come on. Hurry up. I'm late.

03:43.280 --> 03:45.635
Back off!
- Really?

03:49.120 --> 03:50.758
Police! Stop!

03:51.160 --> 03:52.878
Nobody listens.

03:55.880 --> 03:57.836
Tony, get over here!

03:58.240 --> 03:59.639
Come on!

04:02.000 --> 04:03.513
I'm hit.

04:04.160 --> 04:07.948
Where? I can't move my leg.
It's not your leg,

04:08.360 --> 04:10.874
you've got glass in your ass!

04:23.760 --> 04:27.036
First these guys show up late,
and then they ask dumb questions.

04:27.440 --> 04:30.398
Then they shoot you in the ass.
They're pissing me off!

04:42.840 --> 04:43.909
Beginner's luck!

04:49.480 --> 04:50.833
68...

04:52.000 --> 04:53.638
69...

04:55.160 --> 04:56.354
70...

04:56.760 --> 04:59.274
Joe, she's not in.
- She's in, I know it.

04:59.680 --> 05:01.272
Then why don't she answer?

05:01.680 --> 05:05.150
Knows it's me. She's just watching
the phone ring and not answering.

05:05.560 --> 05:09.599
I can feel it.
She's trying to grind me down.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.911
You're crazy, Joe.

05:12.320 --> 05:15.790
You're out of your tiny Jersey mind.

05:31.840 --> 05:33.398
80...

05:33.800 --> 05:35.313
81...

05:55.720 --> 05:59.508
Hey, it's Oetective Alka-Seltzer!
- Not today, okay, Ross.

06:01.680 --> 06:07.277
Thanks, Ray. - Is it true
you used Tony's butt for cover?

06:08.160 --> 06:12.039
Boy, there's a butt
I could use for cover.

06:12.440 --> 06:16.228
Watch what you say about Gwen.
- About "Gwen"?

06:16.640 --> 06:19.518
I'm sorry, Joe.
Are you and the lieutenant involved?

06:19.920 --> 06:23.515
If I thought you were involved,
I never would have said a word.

06:23.920 --> 06:28.118
Joe, Lieutenant wants to see you.
I think she's in a weird mood.

06:29.400 --> 06:30.719
Lovers' tiff?

06:35.200 --> 06:37.953
Morning!
- Sit down.

06:40.720 --> 06:42.995
Know what I was just thinking about?

06:44.360 --> 06:48.114
Remember Catalina? - Of course.
- Great weekend. - The best.

06:48.520 --> 06:52.957
It was great because I was in love.
- Me too.

06:55.840 --> 07:01.472
Remember what I said Sunday morning
when we were sitting on the terrace?

07:01.880 --> 07:04.758
That you'd like me to nibble all...
- Not that.

07:05.160 --> 07:06.878
I was the first man to...

07:07.600 --> 07:08.749
The other stuff.

07:09.760 --> 07:11.591
Oh, the feelings stuff.

07:12.160 --> 07:13.388
Right.

07:13.800 --> 07:18.396
Feelings and responsibilities stuff.
- Come on, Gwen.

07:18.800 --> 07:22.076
If this is about the bust...
- I'm not talking about that fiasco.

07:22.480 --> 07:26.632
You go out getting drunk,
while I stay up worrying!

07:27.040 --> 07:28.678
You didn't call!

07:29.080 --> 07:31.548
It was late.
Oidn't want to wake you.

07:33.840 --> 07:36.229
Here, hold this.
- Why?

07:36.640 --> 07:38.676
Pretend we're talking business.

07:39.080 --> 07:41.514
Oon't want the precinct knowing.

07:41.920 --> 07:44.229
I think they already know.
- What was I to think?

07:44.640 --> 07:46.631
They said somebody got hit.

07:47.040 --> 07:50.589
Then that Tony got hit
and you went to get more beer!

07:51.000 --> 07:54.117
Honey, it's true.
I had a few drinks with the guys.

07:54.520 --> 07:55.509
Yeah?
- Yeah.

07:56.280 --> 08:00.432
That's funny, because Lou told me
you spent the evening on the phone.

08:01.680 --> 08:02.715
So tell me,

08:03.120 --> 08:06.351
who were you calling?
It sure wasn't me!

08:09.000 --> 08:10.433
My mom.

08:12.120 --> 08:13.599
Excuse me?

08:15.840 --> 08:17.956
I was calling my mom.

08:18.920 --> 08:21.878
You were calling your mom
at 2:30 in the morning.

08:22.280 --> 08:25.158
That's the most pathetic excuse!
Tell me who she is.

08:25.560 --> 08:28.074
She isn't anybody, she's my mom.

08:28.480 --> 08:32.712
It doesn't really matter.
Could be your mom or a Oial-a-Bimbo.

08:33.120 --> 08:37.716
It's over! - You don't mean that.
- I mean every word.

08:38.240 --> 08:40.993
It's embarrassing me in my work.
You run away from responsibility.

08:41.400 --> 08:45.951
I'll pack your... - I'm not going to
listen to this. - Where you going?

08:46.360 --> 08:47.429
Fishing!

08:47.840 --> 08:49.193
Get back in here!

08:49.600 --> 08:52.353
Get back in this office, Bomowski!
That's an order.

08:54.040 --> 08:56.600
Mom, I know you're there.

08:58.760 --> 09:00.239
Come on!

09:01.440 --> 09:04.830
Please God,
make her pick up.

09:06.960 --> 09:10.350
Okay, that's it.
I've had it. I've really had it.

09:11.360 --> 09:12.873
I'm a dead man.

09:37.240 --> 09:40.710
This the New York flight?
- Yes, coming out right now.

09:54.400 --> 09:56.231
Relax, kid, relax.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.434
I think that's him. Yeah, it is.

09:59.840 --> 10:01.910
Little Joey!

10:04.480 --> 10:07.438
You must be Joe?
- Yes. Why?

10:08.280 --> 10:11.033
I was a bed-wetter too.

10:12.040 --> 10:14.031
It was so sweet!

10:14.440 --> 10:18.069
He said, "Mommy,
my pee-pee got stuck in my zipper!"

10:20.440 --> 10:23.750
Joey! There's my Joey!
There's my little boy.

10:29.080 --> 10:30.957
Come here!

10:32.640 --> 10:34.835
You've given up shaving.
- No, I shave.

10:35.240 --> 10:37.231
Call that a shave?
- I shaved.

10:37.640 --> 10:39.039
Oid you use a lawnmower?

10:39.760 --> 10:41.671
What girl is going to marry you,

10:42.080 --> 10:43.957
if you don't shave!
- Hi, Tutti!

10:44.920 --> 10:47.639
This is little Joey?
- Looks a lot different in clothes.

10:48.040 --> 10:52.033
We've got to be getting along now,
but thanks for showing us the photos.

10:52.440 --> 10:55.876
You looked real sexy in diapers.

10:56.280 --> 11:00.592
Sally, if things don't work out
with the doctor, Joey's single!

11:01.000 --> 11:04.709
I've always been a sucker
for a guy in Pampers!

11:08.880 --> 11:10.359
What?

11:10.760 --> 11:14.275
I can't get over you driving.
- I've been driving for 20 years!

11:14.680 --> 11:17.990
You'll always be my little Joey.

11:21.680 --> 11:23.830
Where were you the last few days?

11:24.240 --> 11:28.518
At home in New Jersey. Where else?
- I must've called you 50 times.

11:28.920 --> 11:32.356
That was you?
- Why didn't you answer?

11:34.120 --> 11:36.111
For 5 years,
every time I'm about to visit,

11:36.520 --> 11:39.796
you call and say it's a bad time.

11:40.200 --> 11:43.078
This time I decided
I wouldn't answer the phone.

11:43.480 --> 11:45.755
That's the most...
- Watch out!

11:51.480 --> 11:53.516
Moron!
- Up yours, pal!

12:00.640 --> 12:04.155
Sorry.
- Shall I drive? - No!

12:04.560 --> 12:06.198
No, Mom.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.431
I'm okay.

12:12.240 --> 12:14.435
That was a close call, Pixie.

12:14.840 --> 12:16.831
All cars near 4th and Main,

12:17.240 --> 12:20.550
Please respond
to 486 South Main Street. Code 2.

12:25.400 --> 12:29.916
What's going on? - Got a jumper
up there. Looks like he'll do it.

12:40.200 --> 12:42.919
Oid the shrink show up?
- He's on his way.

12:43.320 --> 12:44.753
Stay here.

12:45.160 --> 12:47.310
Where are you going?
- Up there.

12:47.720 --> 12:49.312
It's too dangerous. Listen.

12:49.720 --> 12:52.359
I do this all the time.
I'm not bad at it.

12:52.760 --> 12:55.877
I want you to stay here
and let me take care of this.

12:56.280 --> 12:58.430
Be careful!
Oon't do anything foolish!

13:04.360 --> 13:09.514
What seems to be the man's problem?
- He wants to talk to his mother.

13:09.920 --> 13:11.911
They've been having problems.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.034
Really?

13:23.840 --> 13:26.149
I'll take care of this, officer.

13:32.760 --> 13:36.355
Hey, how are you doing? Alright?
- Leave me alone. Oon't touch me!

13:36.760 --> 13:39.354
Stay back, I'm gonna do it!
- I just want to talk to you.

13:39.760 --> 13:41.671
Oon't tell me what to do!

13:42.080 --> 13:45.629
Stay there, I'm going to do it!
- Hey you, young man!

13:46.040 --> 13:48.156
Oown here! I'm not your mother,

13:48.560 --> 13:51.757
but I am a mother
and you could talk to me,

13:52.160 --> 13:55.914
if that's alright. - Officer,
this is serious. - Let her talk.

13:56.560 --> 13:57.629
What do you want?

13:58.040 --> 14:01.316
I just want you to know
the man next to you is my son.

14:01.720 --> 14:05.679
We've had our difficulties.
- Mom, stay out of this, okay?

14:06.080 --> 14:09.629
Joe, wave to the crowd.
- Mom. Goddamnit!

14:10.040 --> 14:12.076
You don't swear to your mother.

14:12.480 --> 14:15.677
Butt out, it's my mother.
- So do what she tells you.

14:16.080 --> 14:18.310
Start waving or I'm jumping.

14:18.720 --> 14:21.678
Start waving!
Start waving or I'm jumping!

14:22.320 --> 14:25.153
I'm waving. See?
Mom, hi.

14:25.560 --> 14:30.350
By the way, Joe's still single.
How do you like that?

14:30.760 --> 14:33.433
He's a very nice boy.
A bit rough round the edge,

14:33.840 --> 14:38.356
but nothing the right girl couldn't
smooth out. - Secure the megaphone.

14:38.760 --> 14:43.231
We used to fight all the time.
He was very small for his age.

14:43.640 --> 14:47.758
I was not! I was average height!
About your height. What's the deal?

14:48.160 --> 14:52.153
Bet she's got pictures.
- I've got pictures, wait a minute.

14:52.560 --> 14:55.791
She's got pictures.
- Mom, get rid of the pictures!

14:57.320 --> 14:59.117
Isn't he adorable?

15:00.280 --> 15:03.158
I thought I had things bad.
- Not close.

15:03.560 --> 15:04.993
I'm ready to go in now.

15:06.400 --> 15:08.550
Sorry for the inconvenience.
- Yeah.

15:11.920 --> 15:13.831
That guy needs help.

15:14.240 --> 15:18.597
Lesley Carnel, Channel 8 News.
We're downtown at 4th and Main,

15:19.000 --> 15:21.514
where a man is on a ledge,

15:21.920 --> 15:25.959
apparently despondent
about his mother. - Make her stop!

15:39.400 --> 15:40.515
Are we here?

15:40.920 --> 15:42.990
Is that your house?

15:49.360 --> 15:50.873
What?

15:51.280 --> 15:56.149
It's very, very nice.
- What's the matter. - Nothing.

15:56.560 --> 15:58.073
You sniffed.

15:58.560 --> 16:01.028
No, it's nothing. Only...

16:01.440 --> 16:02.714
Only what?

16:03.120 --> 16:05.111
Won't get a girl if you don't clean.

16:05.520 --> 16:08.159
I clean this house every morning.
I clean and I clean.

16:08.560 --> 16:12.712
It's not clean.
Filled with dust. Look at this!

16:13.120 --> 16:16.351
You could grow things on it.

16:17.320 --> 16:21.552
What's this? There's stuff under it.
Is that the closet?

16:25.440 --> 16:27.192
No!
- What?

16:29.640 --> 16:32.108
I've had a few problems
since my cleaning lady left.

16:32.520 --> 16:34.875
Maybe she's lost in there.

16:42.320 --> 16:45.278
Pineapple chunks?
- They're your favorite!

16:45.680 --> 16:47.238
We've got them here too.

16:47.920 --> 16:52.277
They don't taste the same.
- It's canned, exactly the same.

16:52.920 --> 16:57.118
My son, the gourmet? Ha, ha.
Come on up, darling.

17:09.560 --> 17:13.758
This is the way we clean the house,
clean the house, clean the house.

17:14.160 --> 17:18.550
This is the way we clean the house,
early in the morning...

17:19.280 --> 17:22.431
Oh God, make her stop!

17:27.680 --> 17:29.398
Thank you, God.

17:30.400 --> 17:32.197
I owe you.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.038
What's this?

17:52.440 --> 17:54.431
Oh, Joe's gun.

17:55.560 --> 17:57.994
Look at this, all greasy and dirty.

17:58.400 --> 18:00.231
Let's see...

18:01.280 --> 18:04.590
There we go.
This and this...

18:05.000 --> 18:06.718
Some of this...

18:07.840 --> 18:10.832
Let's see... A little of that...

18:14.120 --> 18:15.553
That's gonna be good!

18:16.000 --> 18:19.913
Where do they keep the bullets?

18:22.560 --> 18:24.232
Oh, not in there.

18:24.640 --> 18:26.517
What's this little thing here?

18:26.920 --> 18:31.914
Oh, goodness gracious.
Yes, that's where they are.

18:32.320 --> 18:34.788
Okay, we'll wash those too.

18:40.240 --> 18:43.915
This is the way we wash our gun,
wash our gun, wash our gun...

18:44.760 --> 18:49.675
This is the way we wash our gun,
early in the morning.

18:50.080 --> 18:52.992
Going to clean that out
really well. That's fine.

19:01.760 --> 19:04.115
Go ahead, make your bed!

19:09.600 --> 19:12.797
What did you do to my gun?
- Nothing, I cleaned it.

19:13.200 --> 19:15.077
You ruined it!

19:15.480 --> 19:16.913
You took all the bluing off!

19:17.320 --> 19:20.517
Chlorox? Great!
It's going to blow up in my hand now.

19:20.920 --> 19:22.831
Try to do something helpful...

19:23.240 --> 19:24.832
Nice and original.

19:26.040 --> 19:28.873
You get barked at! Come on, Pix!

19:29.280 --> 19:34.513
Mom, I'm sorry. It's an old gun.
I don't use it any more.

19:41.960 --> 19:43.313
Breakfast!
- Mom!

19:43.720 --> 19:48.430
Nothing I haven't seen before.
- Would you turn around please?

19:49.440 --> 19:50.429
Both of you!

19:50.880 --> 19:51.869
God.

19:53.080 --> 19:58.029
Pixie and I thought we'd pop
into the station, see where you work.

19:59.440 --> 20:00.919
Oid you cut yourself?

20:01.320 --> 20:04.949
No!
- Need some iodine? - No!

20:06.200 --> 20:09.351
A Band-Aid? - No!
The station is out of the question.

20:09.760 --> 20:11.193
Absolutely unequivocally.

20:11.600 --> 20:14.876
We'll talk over breakfast.
- I'm serious.

20:15.280 --> 20:18.989
What did I always tell you?
Breakfast is the most important meal.

20:19.400 --> 20:23.996
Start on these, and I'll scramble
some eggs. - I don't like eggs.

20:24.400 --> 20:28.234
If you don't eat them for breakfast,
they'll be waiting for you at dinner.

20:38.520 --> 20:41.512
Bye, sweetie, have a nice day.
Oh, Joey...

20:41.920 --> 20:44.434
You forgot your lunch!

20:55.720 --> 20:59.235
We're not off
to a very good start, are we, Pixie?

20:59.640 --> 21:01.517
Know what we should do?

21:01.920 --> 21:05.390
We should get
Joey something a little special.

21:06.400 --> 21:07.833
Let's see...

21:19.960 --> 21:21.188
You want to get out here?

21:21.600 --> 21:23.909
I mean, look at this place...

21:24.320 --> 21:26.356
Ridiculous! I'm from Newark.

21:30.240 --> 21:33.198
If you want stopping power,
this is your baby.

21:33.600 --> 21:36.592
Charter Arms, .44, Bulldog.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.072
No, my son's is bigger.
I got a bottle brush down the barrel.

21:40.480 --> 21:42.198
You put a brush down the barrel?

21:42.880 --> 21:45.110
Yeah, I wanted to clean out...
Never mind.

21:45.520 --> 21:48.671
Okay, bigger. How about this?

21:49.080 --> 21:50.069
That's it!

21:50.480 --> 21:54.473
Taurus, PT, .99, long barrel.
Punch a hole through a Pontiac.

21:54.880 --> 22:00.113
How much? - $450. - $450?
- The Bulldog is only $325.

22:01.240 --> 22:05.631
No, I want the big one.
Oon't suppose you gift-wrap? - No.

22:06.040 --> 22:08.838
I'll take it like that.
- There's a cooling-off period.

22:09.240 --> 22:12.516
Give me your driver's license.
I'll do the paperwork.

22:12.920 --> 22:15.593
In 2 weeks it's yours.
- I need it today!

22:16.000 --> 22:18.594
Sorry, that's the law.

22:19.400 --> 22:20.958
Can I have it back?

22:24.120 --> 22:25.519
Come on, Pixie.

22:33.400 --> 22:34.594
Hey, lady!

22:36.600 --> 22:38.670
You want to buy a gun today?

22:39.080 --> 22:41.150
You got a gun for sale?

22:43.800 --> 22:46.678
You do?
- Step into my office.

22:47.080 --> 22:49.594
Lightweight, adjustable stock.
- No!

22:50.000 --> 22:52.275
I want a Taurus.99 long barrel.

22:52.680 --> 22:54.352
Your son will love this.

22:54.760 --> 22:58.389
What'll he do with that? He carries
his gun under his jacket. - Wait!

22:58.800 --> 23:00.950
Wait a minute. Here, here.

23:02.160 --> 23:05.232
What about one of these?
You've seen Miami Vice.

23:05.960 --> 23:10.112
This is a Mac 10.
All the big dealers love this gun.

23:10.520 --> 23:12.636
I don't think that's exactly my Joey.

23:13.040 --> 23:15.713
That's a full automatic. That means

23:16.120 --> 23:20.113
30 shots in 2.5 seconds.
You can cut down trees with it.

23:20.520 --> 23:22.590
How much?
- $500.

23:25.760 --> 23:26.749
$350.

23:39.200 --> 23:41.191
They're there.
- Great.

23:41.600 --> 23:44.239
Bless you.
- I'm coming down with something.

23:44.640 --> 23:47.552
You've got allergies.
- I've got a fever.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.678
The Santa Anna wind's very heavy.

23:50.080 --> 23:52.116
What do you know about it!

23:56.200 --> 24:00.671
Yeah? - Mr. Parnell, we've located
the misappropriated merchandise.

24:01.080 --> 24:02.877
If you're certain it's ours...

24:03.480 --> 24:06.153
then repossess it.
- Yes, sir.

24:06.560 --> 24:10.109
Bless you. - Let's go?
- To work! - Let's go.

24:10.520 --> 24:16.038
Oo you want to sell me the gun,
or sit dreaming about $500?

24:21.000 --> 24:23.639
Okay. Oon't forget that extra clip.

24:32.240 --> 24:33.992
Nice doing business with you.

24:34.400 --> 24:36.311
Come on, Pixie!

24:59.680 --> 25:01.671
He's going round the front.

25:04.440 --> 25:05.509
Oamn!

25:49.200 --> 25:50.679
Morning!

26:01.840 --> 26:04.070
There you go.
- Thanks.

26:11.880 --> 26:13.472
Hangover?

26:14.760 --> 26:16.398
Heartburn.

26:17.960 --> 26:19.951
What did you eat for breakfast?

26:20.720 --> 26:23.314
Juice, fruit, milk,

26:23.720 --> 26:26.473
eggs, bacon and sausage,

26:28.120 --> 26:29.348
hash browns,

26:30.160 --> 26:32.993
toast, pancakes,

26:35.440 --> 26:37.829
honey rolls,

26:38.240 --> 26:41.073
Cocoa Puffs. There's more.

26:41.480 --> 26:45.951
You must've been starving.
- I wasn't hungry.

26:48.160 --> 26:50.594
My mother's visiting.

26:51.520 --> 26:55.195
Well, when your mamma cooks,
she cooks.

26:57.200 --> 26:58.315
Mind you...

26:59.200 --> 27:02.749
breakfast is supposed
to be the most important meal.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.752
Thank you, Tony.

27:12.320 --> 27:14.754
Have a nice day.
- Hey, Joe. - Yeah?

27:15.160 --> 27:17.116
Thank God you've arrived.
- Why?

27:17.520 --> 27:20.796
Your mom's here.
- My mom? - Yes.

27:21.240 --> 27:22.958
Chicken pox?

27:24.280 --> 27:26.032
Looks very good in spots.

27:26.440 --> 27:29.000
Told everybody it was freckles.

27:31.520 --> 27:35.672
Mom, are you okay?
- Fine. These things happen.

27:36.080 --> 27:39.072
What things? - She witnessed
a murder. - A murder?

27:39.480 --> 27:42.472
Yeah, downtown.
- What were you doing downtown?

27:42.880 --> 27:45.917
Shopping. Just relax. Have a cookie.
- Shut up!

27:47.400 --> 27:51.279
Maybe I should get the lieutenant...
- What's going on?

27:51.680 --> 27:53.398
Nothing.
- I'm a witness.

27:53.800 --> 27:55.518
Who is this?
- I'll introduce you.

27:55.920 --> 27:59.629
Ross, you better shut up, I mean it.
- This is Tutti, Joey's mom.

28:00.960 --> 28:03.428
Joey's mom?
- That's right, Gwen.

28:03.840 --> 28:06.798
My mom.
As you can see,

28:07.200 --> 28:09.953
it's been a shock for her,
so I'm taking her home.

28:10.360 --> 28:14.592
Mrs. Bomowski is one of my
principle witnesses. - Your witness?

28:15.000 --> 28:20.120
It's my case. Your mom's happy
to stay to the end of the month.

28:20.520 --> 28:21.475
You said what?

28:22.040 --> 28:26.750
You are so beautiful, Gwen.
That lovely hair and that smile.

28:27.160 --> 28:30.232
Joey, if you'd worn your retainers,
you could've had teeth like that.

28:30.640 --> 28:32.995
Say goodbye, we're going home.
- Not so fast.

28:33.400 --> 28:35.391
I want to interview the witness.

28:36.680 --> 28:40.195
What are you trying to do? - To you?
- This is just ridiculous!

28:40.600 --> 28:42.431
It's ridiculous
your mother witnessed a murder?

28:42.840 --> 28:45.752
No, Ross sticking his head into it.

28:46.160 --> 28:49.550
I can't transfer it to you.
- He's told her to stay in town.

28:49.960 --> 28:54.112
She's supposed to go back Monday.
- That was before the killing.

28:54.520 --> 28:59.355
Can't we fly her back? If she stays
past Monday, I'll kill her myself.

28:59.760 --> 29:03.639
What's wrong with you?
She seems wonderful. Warm, caring...

29:04.040 --> 29:07.191
Obviously crazy about you.
- Crazy is right.

29:07.600 --> 29:11.070
She talks to total strangers
about my diaper rash!

29:11.480 --> 29:14.438
She loves you, Joe.
- Her love is driving me nuts!

29:14.840 --> 29:16.876
Either way, she's staying.

29:21.920 --> 29:24.388
Joe, come on. How bad can it be?

29:24.800 --> 29:27.633
Two, three weeks tops.

29:33.120 --> 29:35.156
This is about us, right?

29:35.560 --> 29:37.869
This is about revenge?

29:39.480 --> 29:42.517
Are you suggesting
I would use my rank? - Yes!

29:42.920 --> 29:45.753
Oon't let the door hit you
on your way out, Oetective.

29:49.760 --> 29:51.990
You can call me Lieutenant.

29:56.320 --> 30:00.438
Oon't be so gloomy! Think of all
the time we'll spend together.

30:01.440 --> 30:04.079
Oon't you want to hear my plan?

30:04.480 --> 30:06.755
I want to brush my teeth
and go to bed.

30:08.160 --> 30:10.071
You and I can crack this case.

30:10.480 --> 30:13.074
When we find the killer,
you'll probably be promoted.

30:13.480 --> 30:15.516
And things will work out with Gwen.

30:24.160 --> 30:25.513
Goodnight.

30:33.200 --> 30:36.670
I didn't tell Ross what I really saw.

30:37.080 --> 30:39.071
I held it all back for you.

30:42.800 --> 30:45.837
You're joking, right, Mom?
- No, it's not a joke.

30:46.240 --> 30:48.834
You can't fool around with homicide.

30:49.240 --> 30:51.310
You need this to get promoted.

30:51.720 --> 30:55.554
I don't want a promotion.
- You're only a sergeant. - I like it.

30:55.960 --> 30:58.155
Next you'll tell me
you like where you live.

30:58.560 --> 31:01.518
I do. Mom, I'm happy.
I don't want to get promoted.

31:01.920 --> 31:05.310
I don't want to get married.
I like my life.

31:05.720 --> 31:09.599
I can wear my underwear more than
once, leave the toilet seat up...

31:10.000 --> 31:13.709
Watch what I want on TV.
Mom, I like my life!

31:14.120 --> 31:16.839
You call this a life?

31:22.560 --> 31:23.879
Goodnight, Mom.

31:38.400 --> 31:40.356
Back off, back off!

31:48.840 --> 31:50.319
I'm going in.
- He has an automatic.

31:50.720 --> 31:52.597
Joe, are you crazy?

32:12.400 --> 32:14.231
Mom, what are you doing here?

32:14.640 --> 32:16.392
Mommy's got to change you.

32:19.680 --> 32:21.671
I don't want to be changed.

32:22.240 --> 32:25.391
I've got to change you.
- I can change you.

32:26.600 --> 32:28.079
Stop trying to change me!

32:43.520 --> 32:45.556
Joey, are you alright?
- I'm fine.

32:45.960 --> 32:50.590
Sounded like you were having
a bad dream. - No, I'm fine, really.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.798
I should tuck you in.
- Oon't, Mom.

32:54.200 --> 32:57.397
Let me tuck you in.
- I don't wanna be tucked in.

32:58.080 --> 33:00.196
Joey, let me tuck you in.

33:01.600 --> 33:04.273
You just snuggle down.
- I don't wanna snuggle.

33:04.680 --> 33:07.069
You were just having a bad dream.

33:09.880 --> 33:13.634
Remember when you were little
and I used to sing to you.

33:14.040 --> 33:16.679
Oh, God!
- Aw, shush.

33:17.080 --> 33:21.392
See if we can remember how that goes.
- Mom, please don't.

33:24.680 --> 33:30.038
Lullaby and goodnight,
thy mother's delight.

33:30.440 --> 33:35.992
With down overspread,
here's baby's wee bed.

33:36.400 --> 33:38.960
Lullaby and goodnight,

33:39.360 --> 33:42.477
lay thee down now and rest.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.833
Lullaby and goodnight,

33:46.240 --> 33:50.597
may thy slumber be best.

33:58.480 --> 34:00.198
Goodnight, Joey.

34:07.800 --> 34:09.152
Morning, Mom.

34:09.560 --> 34:14.588
Better get going or we'll be late.
- I didn't want to wake you.

34:17.880 --> 34:20.996
Better get you to the station
for your 9:30 appointment with Ross.

34:21.520 --> 34:23.590
I'm not saying anything.
- I won't argue.

34:24.000 --> 34:29.313
If he arrests you for withholding
evidence, that's your problem.

34:30.320 --> 34:32.594
Suppose you don't want your present?

34:33.040 --> 34:35.507
Present?
- Just a little something...

34:36.360 --> 34:37.349
A present?

34:37.760 --> 34:40.797
You don't deserve it.
- Come on, Mom. Please.

34:44.400 --> 34:45.799
I love presents.

34:47.360 --> 34:48.918
It's heavy.

35:00.400 --> 35:01.435
Jesus!

35:01.840 --> 35:05.674
Is it the wrong kind? - Wrong kind?
It's illegal. Where did you get it?

35:06.080 --> 35:08.355
From those guys who got shot.

35:08.760 --> 35:10.512
A machine gun off the back of a van?

35:10.920 --> 35:13.229
In the store
they said I had to "cool off."

35:13.640 --> 35:16.074
Why didn't you tell me?

35:17.200 --> 35:19.589
I wanted it to be a surprise.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.797
It is!

35:23.240 --> 35:25.708
You're saying it was a big car?

35:26.560 --> 35:29.313
Oon't know
if I'd call it big exactly.

35:29.720 --> 35:31.676
So it was a small car.

35:32.080 --> 35:36.232
Oifficult to say. To me it was big.
To you it might have been small.

35:38.200 --> 35:40.475
Like a Cadillac?
- Which model?

35:40.880 --> 35:42.108
Any model!

35:43.600 --> 35:44.715
A few years ago...

35:45.120 --> 35:48.317
there was a small one.
- Was it like the Cimarron?

35:49.880 --> 35:51.199
No.

35:51.600 --> 35:53.591
Oefinitely not like the Cimarron.

35:56.040 --> 35:57.837
Let's take a break.

35:58.480 --> 36:01.870
You're tired.
Are you eating right?

36:02.280 --> 36:05.317
I could bring you
some lentil soup. - Be right back.

36:10.480 --> 36:12.630
So far, so good, Pixie.

36:13.040 --> 36:15.998
Gwen, do you have a minute?
- Sure.

36:18.360 --> 36:21.318
Jesus! That's a full automatic.
- I know.

36:21.720 --> 36:25.633
And your mother... Okay, Joe.
I'll trace the gun. - Thanks.

36:26.520 --> 36:29.671
No telling what she'll come home with.
- I know.

36:30.080 --> 36:32.196
I really appreciate it.
If you don't mind?

36:32.600 --> 36:36.036
Try not to kill anyone with it.
- She's too little. Wouldn't hit her.

36:37.240 --> 36:41.995
Who's the little boy by the pool?
- Joey, only 9 and all those muscles!

36:42.400 --> 36:45.392
You can already see
he's going to have nice equipment.

36:46.640 --> 36:50.349
Oon't be embarrassed.
I'm old, but I'm still a woman.

36:50.760 --> 36:53.877
Tell me, do you love my Joey?

36:54.600 --> 36:58.479
I don't know.
I did love him. Maybe I still do.

36:58.880 --> 37:01.030
He loves you.
- He never shows it.

37:01.440 --> 37:04.989
That's Joey.
Ooesn't mean he doesn't love you.

37:05.400 --> 37:08.551
If he'd just show me how he feels!

37:08.960 --> 37:11.997
A box of candy,
a bunch of flowers...

37:12.400 --> 37:16.109
He never sent you flowers?
- Never. - Oh, Joe...

37:16.520 --> 37:19.080
And me being a lieutenant
just makes things worse.

37:19.720 --> 37:21.392
Oid you see this one?

37:21.800 --> 37:24.758
Very serious looking.
How old is he there?

37:25.160 --> 37:28.630
13. This was taken
just after his father died.

37:29.160 --> 37:32.675
I went to pieces,
no good for anything for days.

37:33.080 --> 37:34.911
Joey did everything.

37:35.320 --> 37:38.596
He arranged the funeral,
called the family...

37:39.840 --> 37:41.751
picked out the casket...

37:42.160 --> 37:44.310
talked to the priest...

37:44.720 --> 37:46.711
But he never cried.

37:47.600 --> 37:49.477
I know Joe loved his father.

37:49.880 --> 37:53.873
But to this day
I don't know if he ever cried.

38:06.200 --> 38:09.158
You were talking about something.
- It was nothing.

38:09.560 --> 38:13.348
You were both crying!
- Girl talk. You wouldn't understand.

38:13.760 --> 38:16.320
You have a gift for starting trouble.

38:16.720 --> 38:20.554
Oon't interfere with Gwen and me.
- Well, somebody has to.

38:20.960 --> 38:23.679
She's a lovely girl,
and you never send her flowers.

38:27.760 --> 38:29.432
I'll get the door.

38:29.840 --> 38:32.877
Mom, this is the point of no return!

38:33.280 --> 38:34.190
I've had it.

38:34.600 --> 38:37.592
I've completely had it.
I'm taking you to the apartment,

38:38.000 --> 38:42.710
I'm going to handcuff you to a sink,
and put you on the first plane home.

38:43.120 --> 38:45.395
Here you are. Let's go.

38:56.680 --> 38:59.797
Ask me what I saw!
- I don't want to know.

39:00.200 --> 39:02.191
Ask me.
- No!

39:03.640 --> 39:05.119
Ask me what I saw.

39:05.520 --> 39:07.909
You're an old lady from Newark.

39:08.320 --> 39:11.756
You knit, make jam,
talk on the phone. That's it!

39:14.000 --> 39:15.433
What did you see?

39:16.200 --> 39:19.988
The man who sold me the gun.
The one that got away. And his van.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.516
Really? Was he little? Big?

39:22.920 --> 39:26.117
Big, 6' 3", 320 lbs.

39:26.520 --> 39:30.832
He had a tattoo of a coiled snake
with "God Rides a Harley" above it.

39:31.240 --> 39:36.314
Will you remember this?
A Chevy van, gun-metal gray, an '82.

39:36.720 --> 39:38.631
The year with the longer wheelbase.

39:39.040 --> 39:40.234
License plate:

39:40.640 --> 39:42.949
JL2-661.

39:49.440 --> 39:51.396
This is 90W2,
give me 90W90.

39:51.840 --> 39:53.193
Go ahead, 90W2.

39:53.760 --> 39:58.197
Could you find Tony and tell him
I need another favor. - 10-4.

39:58.840 --> 40:03.152
Where's your boyfriend and the guns?
- What are you talking about?

40:03.560 --> 40:06.233
I hardly know the guy.

40:06.640 --> 40:08.995
Paulie, nothing down there.

40:09.400 --> 40:13.996
Check the garage. - I did,
there's nothing. - Well, check there.

40:23.200 --> 40:26.078
Is this the house?
- That's where the van's registered.

40:26.480 --> 40:29.950
Shall I cover the back?
- We're not partners!

40:30.360 --> 40:31.679
Okay, okay.

40:35.280 --> 40:38.431
We're not connecting here, honey.

40:42.600 --> 40:44.192
Keep her quiet!

40:46.520 --> 40:47.635
Wrong house?

40:48.680 --> 40:50.318
Help me! Help me!

40:51.440 --> 40:52.555
Come on.

40:57.320 --> 40:58.514
Oh gosh, no!

41:01.000 --> 41:01.989
Okay?
- Yeah.

41:05.720 --> 41:07.472
Joey, are you alright?

41:08.760 --> 41:09.749
Oon't jump!

41:41.040 --> 41:45.989
Get in, sweetie!
We're gonna nail those turkeys!

41:46.880 --> 41:49.678
Okay, Ma. Make a right!
- Okay. - That's good.

42:15.520 --> 42:17.192
Sorry.
- It was an accident.

42:21.800 --> 42:23.950
Jump!
Use the road!

42:28.680 --> 42:29.795
Watch it!

42:31.520 --> 42:33.192
Way to go, Mom!

42:38.200 --> 42:39.713
Floor it!

42:40.120 --> 42:42.315
They're going left.
- Slow down.

42:43.280 --> 42:44.793
Left! Slow it down!

42:45.640 --> 42:46.595
Be careful!

42:52.280 --> 42:55.397
There's nothing in there.
I already looked.

42:57.640 --> 43:01.189
What's in the file?
It's the trace on the gun, isn't it?

43:01.600 --> 43:05.115
What does it say, Joe?
- I haven't read it.

43:05.520 --> 43:07.954
I'm giving it to Ross.

43:08.360 --> 43:10.430
I don't believe this.
- Believe it!

43:10.840 --> 43:13.718
Look who it is.
Norman Bates and his mom!

43:14.120 --> 43:16.156
Cut it out!
- You're going to tell him?

43:16.760 --> 43:18.432
My mother lied.

43:18.840 --> 43:23.038
She got the license plate
and I traced the address.

43:23.440 --> 43:25.954
Shit!
- Watch your mouth.

43:26.360 --> 43:31.275
That's rich coming from the most
pathetic cop ever in this precinct.

43:33.120 --> 43:35.395
Is there anything else...

43:35.800 --> 43:38.030
I should know?
- Yes, Oetective.

43:38.640 --> 43:40.949
We think you're an asshole.

43:45.880 --> 43:47.757
Take a walk with me.

43:54.720 --> 43:56.950
Think I'm going to take that?

43:57.360 --> 43:59.954
She's just an old lady.

44:00.360 --> 44:04.399
A monster, that's what she is.
And her cookies suck!

44:04.800 --> 44:07.394
Watch what you say!
- I'm not watching anything!

44:07.800 --> 44:10.633
If you even look at this case...

44:11.040 --> 44:13.235
I'll throw your mom in a county can

44:13.640 --> 44:17.792
before you can say "Golden Ager"!
- Are you threatening my mother?

44:18.200 --> 44:19.349
You, your mom...

44:19.760 --> 44:22.320
Your whole goodamn family.

44:22.720 --> 44:26.076
Ross, you just made
a big mistake. - Oh, sure.

44:26.800 --> 44:27.835
What are you doing?

44:29.000 --> 44:30.353
Jesus Christ!

44:39.960 --> 44:41.712
Hi.
- Hi.

44:43.040 --> 44:47.238
You forgot to dry your hands.
- Ross needs the towels more than me.

44:47.640 --> 44:51.519
Ross needs the towels?
- Long story. - Oh, excuse me.

44:54.720 --> 44:57.598
I have your toothbrush.
- My toothbrush?

44:58.000 --> 44:59.194
Yeah.

45:00.440 --> 45:03.876
With the frog's head.
I forgot to pack it.

45:04.840 --> 45:06.068
Thanks.

45:09.200 --> 45:10.599
Lieutenant!

45:11.000 --> 45:15.118
I want to file a complaint
against him and his mom...

45:15.520 --> 45:17.795
for assault
and withholding information.

45:18.200 --> 45:21.670
What, Ross?
Nothing, just flushing him out.

45:22.080 --> 45:24.719
I'm gonna see you suspended.

45:26.720 --> 45:29.439
Ross! - What?
- Get back to your desk.

45:29.840 --> 45:32.559
Oh, Lieutenant...
- Now! Please.

45:42.400 --> 45:47.315
It's a man thing.
I'd better get back to my desk too.

45:48.320 --> 45:51.596
Oh, Gwen. Thanks for the brush.

45:56.560 --> 45:58.869
The gun was part of a shipment...

45:59.280 --> 46:01.840
that wound up downtown.

46:02.240 --> 46:06.358
The warehouse burnt down and
the watchman was killed in the fire.

46:06.760 --> 46:09.638
Big explosion of ammunition.

46:10.040 --> 46:13.396
Guns destroyed,
cause of the fire never established.

46:13.800 --> 46:18.999
Company goes broke.
Insurance pays 12 million.

46:20.400 --> 46:21.674
Are you listening?

46:22.080 --> 46:26.312
Like Mr. Krueger. He burnt his
luncheonette down for the insurance.

46:26.720 --> 46:29.837
They found the silver at home.
- Same thing here.

46:30.240 --> 46:32.470
Your gun didn't get burned.

46:32.880 --> 46:38.477
Mama knows! When we get home,
I'm gonna make you a fresh hamburger.

46:39.680 --> 46:44.549
She doesn't like fast food.
- It's not that. - What?

46:44.960 --> 46:48.430
Ross' face when you said,
we think you're an asshole.

46:48.840 --> 46:50.671
I gave it to him good.

46:51.080 --> 46:55.631
Blew him away. - His ass was grass,
and I was the lawnmower.

46:58.480 --> 47:00.948
You're really something, Mom.

47:06.920 --> 47:10.435
I'm going to go up
and talk to these guys. Be right back.

47:13.800 --> 47:18.635
We could do "good cop, bad cop"!
- I can handle it. Thanks.

47:21.600 --> 47:24.876
Oo you really want to go?
- You know I do. - Okay.

47:25.280 --> 47:27.953
Go downstairs and sniff around.

47:28.360 --> 47:31.193
I'll be upstairs with the big boys.

47:32.200 --> 47:34.111
It's that cop.

47:34.520 --> 47:37.990
Get in the side office
till he's gone. Move it!

47:39.880 --> 47:42.553
Yeah, show the officer in.

47:44.520 --> 47:47.990
Oetective Joseph Bomuwski.
- Bomowski. - Good afternoon.

47:48.400 --> 47:49.628
What can I do for you?

47:51.280 --> 47:55.637
I'm investigating a warehouse fire,
a lot of weapons were destroyed.

47:56.040 --> 47:58.349
You collected the insurance.
- Yes.

47:58.760 --> 48:02.355
I hope there isn't any problem.
- What would say if we had evidence

48:02.760 --> 48:05.399
that the weapons
weren't destroyed in the fire.

48:06.360 --> 48:09.716
That we were the victim of a fraud.

48:10.440 --> 48:14.399
You don't look like a victim,
you look more like a beneficiary.

48:19.320 --> 48:20.469
Excuse me.

48:25.040 --> 48:28.794
A woman out there
is claiming to be your mother. - No!

48:29.200 --> 48:33.512
Sorry. - That's alright.
- They tried... - I'll handle this.

48:33.920 --> 48:36.309
I say we work them over!
- Just wait outside.

48:36.720 --> 48:38.676
It's almost under control.
- Joe...

48:39.080 --> 48:44.234
they're being audited.
I know an audit when I see one.

48:44.640 --> 48:48.519
Mom, later!
- It's the motive.

48:48.920 --> 48:50.319
Gesundheit!

48:52.840 --> 48:55.593
Lot of accusations flying around.

48:56.000 --> 48:57.638
What do you want?

48:58.040 --> 49:01.350
To look at the warehouse.
Any problem with that?

49:01.760 --> 49:04.320
Oo you have a warrant?

49:04.720 --> 49:06.517
Or your mother?
- No.

49:06.920 --> 49:08.592
But I've a good mind...

49:09.000 --> 49:12.549
to give you
a spanking you won't forget.

49:16.280 --> 49:19.431
Oo I go to the warehouse
or do I get a warrant?

49:24.880 --> 49:27.758
Give the detective
the address of the warehouse...

49:28.160 --> 49:32.073
where we had that fire,
with the keys and whatever else.

49:35.640 --> 49:38.393
Thanks for your time. Mom, let's go!

49:38.800 --> 49:41.360
For now you can keep your pants on.

49:41.760 --> 49:43.637
But just remember:

49:44.040 --> 49:47.032
I'll be back!
What? Oid I embarrass you?

49:47.440 --> 49:49.237
Yeah, "I'll be back"!

49:49.640 --> 49:53.838
I heard a cop say that.
- Terminators say that, not cops.

49:54.320 --> 49:55.548
Get out here!

49:55.960 --> 50:00.750
You idiots! Not only do you
let ten cases of guns get stolen

50:01.160 --> 50:03.549
and screw up their return.
I've now got...

50:03.960 --> 50:07.396
some cop's weird mother
threatening to spank me!

50:07.800 --> 50:11.554
We'll take care of them. They won't
bother you. - They'd better not.

50:12.720 --> 50:16.076
I'll get the plane tomorrow.
All you've got to do is make sure...

50:16.480 --> 50:18.789
everyone keeps quiet for 24 hours.

50:19.200 --> 50:21.873
Make it look like an accident.

50:35.320 --> 50:38.471
Oon't like the look of this.
It's dangerous, don't go.

50:38.880 --> 50:40.598
It's not dangerous.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.833
So I can go too?
- Oh no.

50:44.240 --> 50:46.117
We're working so well together.

50:46.520 --> 50:50.752
Right, and working well together
means looking out for each other.

50:51.320 --> 50:52.639
What are you doing?

50:53.920 --> 50:57.913
Answer me! What are you doing?
- What does it look like?

50:58.480 --> 51:02.837
Looks like you're locking me in.
- Got my detective skills from you.

51:41.640 --> 51:43.039
That's not gonna work.

51:49.600 --> 51:51.670
Let's put that in here.

51:52.320 --> 51:54.709
How does this thing go?

52:00.680 --> 52:02.750
Hello, hello.

52:03.560 --> 52:06.711
This is a police radio band.
Please identify yourself.

52:07.120 --> 52:09.236
Tutti Bomowski, Joe's mom.

52:09.640 --> 52:15.237
Hi, Mrs. Bomowski, this is John.
Thanks for the cookies. What's up?

52:18.760 --> 52:21.274
I'm so embarrassed.

52:21.680 --> 52:26.470
Somehow I managed to lock
myself in Joe's car. Is that silly?

52:26.880 --> 52:28.677
No problem, Mrs. Bomowski.

52:29.080 --> 52:33.392
You're going to look for a Slim Jim,
a long, thin piece of metal.

52:59.880 --> 53:00.835
Shoot!

53:01.240 --> 53:05.552
Jesus! - I don't want to live
in a world where my son locks me in.

53:10.280 --> 53:12.555
Enough bullets in that gun?
- Quiet!

53:12.960 --> 53:15.076
Because if you don't, I do.

53:15.480 --> 53:19.553
Where did you get that?
- From your messy glove comparment.

53:20.040 --> 53:21.598
Give it me.
- No.

53:22.160 --> 53:24.958
Give it to me.
- No.

53:25.960 --> 53:26.995
Mom, down!

53:32.000 --> 53:33.228
Jump!

53:46.640 --> 53:48.756
Is Pixie okay?
- She's okay.

53:57.200 --> 53:58.394
Shit!

54:02.800 --> 54:05.189
What are you going to do?

54:09.280 --> 54:11.111
- Take the dog.

54:11.520 --> 54:14.592
Get over there. - Where?
- Against the wall. - Okay.

54:16.200 --> 54:17.394
Get back!

54:29.840 --> 54:31.990
Stop! Police!

54:39.680 --> 54:41.591
Get down!
- They're getting away!

54:42.600 --> 54:43.749
Stop!

54:45.280 --> 54:46.793
Or my mom will shoot!

54:53.240 --> 54:56.198
A little high,
but not bad for a beginner.

55:00.280 --> 55:02.714
Paulie! Start it up fast!

55:08.280 --> 55:11.192
Turn around.
- I'm not going nowhere.

55:11.600 --> 55:14.592
Take it easy!
- Great collar, Joe.

55:15.000 --> 55:18.879
Think you could mess with my boy?

55:20.280 --> 55:21.793
Gesundheit.

55:28.480 --> 55:30.198
Ousty here.

55:30.600 --> 55:32.352
Put it in that chair.

55:32.760 --> 55:35.797
Alright, file this.
- I want to see a lawyer.

55:36.200 --> 55:38.395
And a doctor.
- You're spreading germs.

55:38.800 --> 55:42.679
Tell Ross me and my mother
cracked his case wide open.

55:43.080 --> 55:45.719
Before you say anything...

55:55.840 --> 55:57.432
What was that?

55:58.000 --> 56:02.118
I'm just happy you've unlocked
those hidden feelings. - Feelings?

56:02.520 --> 56:06.798
What do you mean? - The flowers.
I've never seen so many roses.

56:09.400 --> 56:12.358
I don't believe it.
- What?

56:12.760 --> 56:16.673
She's always got to interfere.
Orives me crazy! - What?

56:18.400 --> 56:20.152
It was my mom.

56:21.840 --> 56:25.389
You mean you didn't send the roses?

56:25.800 --> 56:28.234
Of course I didn't.

56:29.560 --> 56:31.073
I didn't mean it...

56:37.720 --> 56:40.951
Mom, get your
senior citizen's butt in here!

56:41.600 --> 56:42.555
What?

56:42.960 --> 56:44.598
Oon't say a word!

56:45.000 --> 56:47.912
Something about Gwen?
- I want to talk to you!

56:48.320 --> 56:51.790
No need to shout.
- This is my house.

56:52.200 --> 56:56.318
I know this is hard for you,
but I've drawn up a list of rules.

56:56.720 --> 56:58.517
I don't like the tone of your voice.

56:58.920 --> 57:02.390
Rule no. 1: Never say
you don't like the tone of my voice!

57:02.800 --> 57:03.994
Rule no. 2...

57:04.520 --> 57:07.910
You've written a list?
- Yes, and don't interrupt.

57:08.600 --> 57:09.396
No. 2:

57:09.800 --> 57:12.553
Oon't interfere with my love life.

57:12.960 --> 57:15.679
She didn't like the flowers?
- They were a big hit!

57:17.120 --> 57:19.395
3: Oon't clean!
4: Oon't iron my underwear!

57:19.800 --> 57:23.509
5: Never tell anyone the embarrassing
things from when I was a kid!

57:23.920 --> 57:27.310
Just a minute...
- This is non-negotiable.

57:28.840 --> 57:31.957
6: Oon't clean, buy, or shoot guns!

57:32.360 --> 57:36.148
7: Here's a public
safety message: No driving!

57:37.520 --> 57:41.308
8: Never say breakfast is
the most important meal. And 9:

57:41.720 --> 57:44.757
The photos stay in New Jersey.

57:45.160 --> 57:46.639
Anything else?

57:47.040 --> 57:51.431
10: Sometimes forget I'm your son
and treat me like a human being.

57:52.120 --> 57:57.399
You can't treat me like this.
- Yes, I can. Think about it.

58:06.000 --> 58:09.993
You think making me follow
these rules will improve your life?

58:10.400 --> 58:16.236
I'm not listening.
- I'll tell you what your problem is.

58:16.640 --> 58:21.998
Rule no. 11: Oon't tell me
what my problem is. I know what it is.

58:22.400 --> 58:24.595
An old lady with a dog.

58:25.000 --> 58:28.993
You don't love enough. If someone
gets close, you shut them out.

58:29.400 --> 58:31.231
Like me and Gwen.
- You see this?

58:31.640 --> 58:33.870
She turned into Or. Ruth!

58:34.280 --> 58:36.714
It scares you that Gwen loves you.

58:37.120 --> 58:41.477
When you meet someone special,
you should grab hold of them.

58:41.880 --> 58:44.155
What are you talking about?
- About waking up...

58:44.560 --> 58:46.994
and finding you're 60 years old...

58:47.400 --> 58:50.472
in a little apartment
all by yourself, wishing you had...

58:50.880 --> 58:52.552
someone as special as Gwen.

58:53.760 --> 58:56.957
She's right.
- She's really upset.

58:57.360 --> 58:58.793
Finished?

59:02.640 --> 59:06.349
For your information:
I didn't dump Gwen, she dumped me.

59:56.040 --> 59:58.156
Gwen, I just...

01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:02.714
I just called to say you're special.

01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:05.588
Oh Christ, that's ridiculous.

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:08.272
I just called...

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:12.358
to say that you're so special.

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:17.589
And when you meet
someone special, you should...

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.195
grab hold.

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:22.996
You should grab hold of them.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:24.671
Oh, come on!

01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:26.911
Just do it right.

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:31.233
When you meet someone special,
you should grab hold of them. - Joe?

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:36.629
What are you doing here so late?

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:41.599
Just catching up on paperwork.

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:45.388
I had to pick some stuff up.

01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:50.071
Want to catch up on paperwork, too?

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:52.470
Sure.

01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:58.196
To paperwork.

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:07.599
Look...

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:10.591
I'm sorry that I hit you.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.470
I was just
disappointed about the flowers.

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:17.872
I deserved to get hit.
I made a mess of everything.

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:22.239
I wish I'd sent you the flowers.

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:23.709
Really?

01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:33.358
You're so special.

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:38.195
When you meet
someone as special as you,

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:40.591
you should grab them.

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:47.675
Otherwise, one morning
you'll wake up and you're 60,

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:51.117
living alone in a little apartment.

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:53.636
And you wish...

01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:57.830
you had the chance
to love someone as special as you.

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:03.953
That's the sweetest thing
anyone's said to me.

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:19.950
My mother said it, Gwen.

01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:25.638
Your mother? - She was right.
Jesus, it kills me.

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:29.558
Ooes this kill you?

01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:57.639
Hey, boss. What's happening?
- There you are.

01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:00.474
Take a look at this note.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.639
"I regret my life of crime.

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:09.793
I can't live anymore. J. Parnell."

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:12.270
Well, what do you think?

01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:16.919
You've been under pressure lately.

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:19.880
You might be overreacting.

01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:22.999
We've got the weapons,
we're going to South America,

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:26.949
and claiming lots of money.
Why are you so depressed?

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:29.954
I'm not going to kill myself.

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:32.598
It's part of the plan.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.437
They read the note, we disappear.
Then they don't come looking for us.

01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:40.474
Good idea.

01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:43.394
No, no. That's a great idea.

01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:46.268
There's one for you too. You sign that

01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:48.591
and we can get out of here.

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:52.993
Make sure you sign it clearly.

01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:57.754
Let me take a look at that.

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:08.679
Very nice.

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:17.992
That hurts.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:46.312
"Oear Joe. I'm sorry. I can't
help myself. I love you too much.

01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:49.917
I've left to be
out of your way. Love, Mom. PS:

01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:53.591
About the flowers.
I've ruined it for you and Gwen.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.356
Maybe one day
you can forgive me. PPS:

01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:00.752
There's a pineapple
upside-down cake in the icebox."

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:02.195
Oamn!

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:12.152
Hey!
- Sorry!

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:21.389
Excuse me!

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:54.678
Wait!
- Hey, slow down.

01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:57.709
You alright?

01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:00.355
Mom, stop!

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:04.953
No, Joe,
you got to live your own life.

01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:08.079
You were right.
I don't want you to go.

01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:11.995
Slow down. - You were right
about grabbing onto Gwen.

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:13.833
I was wrong.

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:16.549
When I told her,
it changed everything.

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:21.230
It did?
- Yes. Mom, I want you to stay.

01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:23.835
Quick, stop the cart!

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:31.833
Really?

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:34.833
You know I do.

01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:42.271
Now tell me.

01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:45.035
What did Gwen say when you told her?

01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:48.591
That it's the sweetest thing
anyone ever said to her.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.117
And then?
- That's what she said.

01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:56.718
You didn't propose to her?
- No, but I mean it's a beginning.

01:06:57.120 --> 01:07:00.908
It's a missed opportunity.
- Wait. Wait.

01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:04.153
Stop right there.
- What?

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:07.351
You're doing it again.
- What?

01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:10.671
Interfering. Rule no. 2.

01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:13.674
You can't be serious about the rules?

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:19.433
Gate 18, fast!
Oon't want her to miss her flight.

01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:21.558
What are you doing?

01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:25.396
Have a nice ride home.
- What are you doing?

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.513
Thank you. Joey!

01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:32.998
Joseph A. Bomowski,
this is your mother talking.

01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:38.149
Wait a minute!
Can't we discuss these rules?

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:42.758
They're non-negotiable.
- What about a little flexibility?

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:47.870
Flexibility? Give you an inch,
you take the entire turnpike. - Okay.

01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:49.998
Okay what?

01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:52.318
The rules.

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:54.073
You got a deal.

01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:58.552
You got a deal.

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:11.956
It'll be the best weekend
we ever spent together. - Maybe not.

01:08:18.399 --> 01:08:19.515
Stay here.

01:09:04.399 --> 01:09:07.915
Got him! - I told you
to wait outside. - Yeah, yeah.

01:09:08.319 --> 01:09:10.880
You promised to leave me alone.

01:09:11.279 --> 01:09:13.032
So, I'll start tomorrow.

01:09:13.439 --> 01:09:15.078
I give up.

01:09:18.399 --> 01:09:20.993
Holy moley!
That's the guy who sold me the gun.

01:09:21.399 --> 01:09:23.231
It is?
- Yeah.

01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:28.269
More chocolate, Mitchell?
- No thanks, Mrs. Bomowski.

01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:30.557
You, sweetie?
- No, I'm fine.

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:34.316
Why'd you come here?
It's not even my case.

01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:36.870
To save my girlfriend's life.

01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:41.633
My house ain't safe.
My brother's dead.

01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:43.393
I got nowhere to go.

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:45.995
Any idea who these people are?

01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:52.270
We stole a few cases of shooters
but there were thousands of them.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:57.278
The ones supposed to have
been destroyed. We got them. - Where?

01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:01.389
Brunswick airstrip.
Outside of Ventura. It went bankrupt.

01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:06.476
A savings and loan took it over.
- Great. Joe and I'll check it out.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:12.278
Remember when I was in school,
every week you would call my teachers

01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:14.989
to see if I was doing good
and cutting class.

01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:17.630
Embarrassed the hell out of me.

01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:21.077
It wasn't you didn't trust me...

01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:23.038
you just wanted to make sure...

01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:26.352
I didn't get into trouble.

01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:30.077
You finally understand.
- I do understand.

01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:34.716
And I want you
to understand why I have to do...

01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:37.395
this!

01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:41.349
Whoa, bummer!

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.231
I once did this before
when Joey was 9.

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:55.798
He got his head caught in a railing.
The problem was his ears.

01:10:56.480 --> 01:11:00.951
They were so big for his age.
They kept getting caught on the bars.

01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:04.519
I got it. I did it.

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:09.033
I'm out! I did it!
- Yo, Mrs. B! Way to go, babe!

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:11.829
Sometimes I impress myself.

01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:13.992
Could you help me off?

01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:19.349
Where's my gun? I'm outta here.
- With your keys in the bathroom.

01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:21.079
Thanks, babe.

01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:39.908
Major bummer.

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:45.437
Sorry, Mitchell.
I need your car.

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:49.435
And I don't think
Joey wants you going off to Mexico.

01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:53.196
Hold still. This won't hurt a bit.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.389
Be back to get you, babe.

01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:31.269
Get back.

01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:59.157
Sergeant Bomowski. I need assistance
at Brunkswick airstrip, right away.

01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:31.679
Let me go!
- Hurry up.

01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:39.553
Move it. Come on.

01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:43.552
Where's your little boy?

01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:46.997
You won't get away with this.
My Joe will be all over you.

01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:50.472
Get her on the plane,
so her son can't interfere.

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:54.475
When we get her over the ocean,
we'll see how well she can swim.

01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:57.030
Move it! Move it!

01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:04.629
Sit down.

01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:58.439
Shit!

01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:15.233
Get out there and find him.

01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:19.069
Get off. Take her down.

01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:20.993
Oh God!

01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:25.231
Where are you taking me?

01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:27.631
Shut up!
- Joey!

01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:41.475
There you are. Orop it!

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:46.830
You okay?
- Why are you here?

01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:49.595
I came to back you up.
- Get him inside!

01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:52.914
Let her go.

01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:56.630
Oo you think
I'd be content with just killing you?

01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:58.758
Let her go!

01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:00.479
Or what?

01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:07.274
It's over. Parnell, it's all over.

01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:10.478
Get the car.
I'll tell you what's over.

01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:14.595
Say goodbye to your little boy.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.594
You're next. Hold it!

01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:21.309
You know...

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.118
this is really going
to give me a great deal of pleasure.

01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:48.829
Nobody hurts my baby.

01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:10.230
Gee whiz. You shot him.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.831
No shit.

01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:16.677
Mom, you saved my life.

01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:19.635
That's what moms are for.

01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:34.152
I can't believe it,
but I'm sad to see you go.

01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:39.031
Oon't worry. I'll be back.
- Not too soon, I hope. Just kidding.

01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:41.956
It's been great, Tutti.
- Such fun.

01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:46.194
I can see why you like policework.
It's so stimulating. - Yeah.

01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:49.512
Can I see the ring?
- Okay.

01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:54.718
Beautiful. I couldn't have done
better if I'd picked it out myself.

01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:58.510
I thought you did.
- Mom, that's your flight.

01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:04.672
Well, thanks for everything.

01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:11.995
I think that man is a criminal.

01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:15.315
I recognize him from TV.

01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:18.632
I don't think so. You'll be late.
- Joe, look.

01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:20.871
He's trying to avoid the detector!

01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:22.599
Please!
- Hey, young man!

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.230
Oon't give me that innocent look.

01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:29.872
My son is a police officer.
Oraw your gun. He's getting away.

01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:33.671
Rule no. 12: Listen to your mother!

01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:41.194
Move!

01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:48.358
Here. Cuffs!

01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:51.638
Let us through. Police.

01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:55.795
Joey, now I remember what he did.

01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:58.119
He shot his mother!
