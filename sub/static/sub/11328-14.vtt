<i>Previously on "The Secret Life Of
The American Tennager"...</i>

00:03.176 --> 00:04.593
She's coming here... Now.

00:04.678 --> 00:05.911
Her dad has
a business trip planned,

00:05.946 --> 00:08.314
And she wants to come
with him to see me.

00:08.348 --> 00:10.983
Don't let amy break up with you because
her italian girlfriend is showing up.

00:11.017 --> 00:13.452
Break up with her because
you don't want to be with
her anymore.

00:13.486 --> 00:15.521
I love, love, love
getting away with you.

00:15.555 --> 00:16.622
Maybe we shouldn't have lied.

00:16.656 --> 00:18.090
This is the school counselor

00:18.124 --> 00:20.092
Calling to find out
why you're not in class.

00:20.126 --> 00:22.394
I think my mom is leaving.
She got an offer.

00:22.429 --> 00:23.996
The job is in new york.

00:24.030 --> 00:26.198
Having sex ruined
everything for us.

00:26.232 --> 00:29.134
Not continuing to have sex
ruined everything for us.

00:29.169 --> 00:31.303
Ben! Benito!

00:33.106 --> 00:35.307
I made a mistake of asking ann
if there was any possibility

00:35.342 --> 00:36.875
That the baby
might not be mine,

00:36.910 --> 00:38.744
So ann took the baby
and went to see her mother.

00:38.778 --> 00:41.280
She took amy and john, too.
But they're coming back.

00:41.314 --> 00:43.916
I don't know.
I don't even know if
they know they're coming back.

00:43.950 --> 00:45.784
I never actually thought
she'd come to california.

00:45.819 --> 00:47.987
Now's she's here with her dad.

00:48.021 --> 00:49.655
I do love amy,

00:49.689 --> 00:51.290
But I want to be
with other girls.

00:51.324 --> 00:54.159
I want to date and have sex.

00:54.194 --> 00:57.096
You could mediate
a legal agreement
without going to court.

00:57.130 --> 00:59.631
I want to see my son, amy.
I want you to bring john home.

01:07.774 --> 01:09.508
Ben?

01:16.116 --> 01:17.216
Thought I heard something.

01:20.653 --> 01:22.554
So are you going to see
your friend

01:22.589 --> 01:24.256
Before she goes back
to Italy?

01:24.290 --> 01:26.325
Uh, I don't know.

01:26.359 --> 01:28.293
Did you talk to amy?

01:28.328 --> 01:32.164
I mean, unless I see my friend,
there's no sense in talking
to amy about anything--

01:32.198 --> 01:35.167
Well, not about my friend
anyway, right?

01:35.201 --> 01:37.336
Right, unless you're
going to continue to have

01:37.370 --> 01:38.971
A relationship
with your friend.

01:39.005 --> 01:40.539
In that case
you may want to tell amy.

01:40.573 --> 01:42.307
I'll just play it by ear.

01:42.342 --> 01:44.009
By ear.

01:44.044 --> 01:46.678
Yeah, you do that.

01:46.713 --> 01:48.280
Good night.
Good night.

01:49.749 --> 01:51.050
You want me to shut the door?

01:51.084 --> 01:55.154
Uh, yeah, it's just
that I'm...Studying.

01:55.188 --> 01:56.221
What are you studying?

01:58.491 --> 02:00.692
Oh, where'd you get this?

02:00.727 --> 02:02.261
Betty's yard sale.

02:02.295 --> 02:04.196
Honestly,
it's a very good story.

02:04.230 --> 02:05.364
About sex.

02:05.398 --> 02:06.432
About life.

02:06.466 --> 02:09.033
Uh-huh.

02:09.068 --> 02:10.269
Good night.

02:17.877 --> 02:20.212
Anything going on
you want to tell me about?

02:20.246 --> 02:22.147
Not at this moment, no.

02:27.287 --> 02:28.320
New supply?

02:28.354 --> 02:29.855
Did you need--

02:31.291 --> 02:33.192
Nope. Good night.

02:33.226 --> 02:36.195
I don't know what you're up to,
but good night.

02:43.803 --> 02:45.604
Benito, you found me.

02:45.638 --> 02:48.607
Maria, I did.

02:52.345 --> 02:58.016
<i>"falling in love is such
an easy thing to do,</i>

02:58.051 --> 03:00.486
<i>"birds can do it
we can do it,</i>

03:00.520 --> 03:03.222
<i>" let's stop talking
let's get to it,</i>

03:03.256 --> 03:05.691
<i>"let's fall in love".</i>

03:09.829 --> 03:12.164
You don't have to have
your shirt off for that.

03:12.198 --> 03:13.265
I know.

03:13.299 --> 03:14.566
It just balances
the masculine

03:14.601 --> 03:15.534
With the feminine.

03:15.568 --> 03:16.635
Whatever.

03:16.669 --> 03:18.137
Put your shirt back on.

03:18.171 --> 03:20.639
What's the problem?

03:20.673 --> 03:23.008
Uncomfortable
with the male body?

03:23.042 --> 03:24.243
Oh, shut up.

03:26.179 --> 03:27.713
Are you sure you're gay?

03:27.747 --> 03:30.215
Why don't you think
about that question,

03:30.250 --> 03:31.416
Then ask me again.

03:31.451 --> 03:34.186
Of course I could be mistaken
for metrosexual.

03:34.220 --> 03:36.989
Then again there's nothing
really metro about me,

03:37.023 --> 03:38.290
And I am gay,

03:38.324 --> 03:40.092
And metrosexuals
are gay, too,

03:40.126 --> 03:41.293
So there you go.

03:41.327 --> 03:42.728
Griffin?

03:42.762 --> 03:43.896
George.

03:43.930 --> 03:45.197
What's the--

03:45.231 --> 03:46.231
Clarifying mask.

03:46.266 --> 03:47.332
Clarifying what?

03:47.367 --> 03:48.400
That I'm gay.

03:48.434 --> 03:49.434
That's what I thought.

03:49.469 --> 03:51.236
Just removes
all the impurities.

03:51.271 --> 03:53.205
Impurities from...

03:53.239 --> 03:54.339
From...

03:54.374 --> 03:56.208
From his face.

03:56.242 --> 03:57.209
All right. I didn't know.

03:57.243 --> 03:58.710
Thought it was for his mind
or something.

03:58.745 --> 04:01.280
Because I'm gay I have
impurities of the mind?

04:01.314 --> 04:03.248
Don't get all defensive.
I just didn't know
what that thing was...

04:03.283 --> 04:05.250
On a guy.

04:05.285 --> 04:06.318
Why does he have
his shirt off?

04:06.352 --> 04:07.853
Why, uncomfortable
with the male body?

04:07.887 --> 04:09.488
Yes, I am.
Put your shirt on.

04:09.522 --> 04:11.657
I don't care
if you're gay or not,
and keep your pants on.

04:11.691 --> 04:12.558
Dad.

04:12.592 --> 04:14.193
We have other rooms,
you know.

04:14.227 --> 04:15.961
There are plenty of beds
all over the house
if you're staying over.

04:15.995 --> 04:17.963
Ashley said
I can stay right here.

04:17.997 --> 04:19.565
You said he could sleep over
in my room.

04:19.599 --> 04:21.300
right.

04:21.334 --> 04:22.701
You sure you're gay?

04:22.735 --> 04:25.103
Is this going to be an issue
every time I sleep over?

04:25.138 --> 04:27.139
Probably. Dad,
he's fine staying in my room.

04:27.173 --> 04:29.174
All right. You know,
it's kind of lonely
in there.

04:29.209 --> 04:30.709
You guys want to hang out in
the family room, watch some tv?

04:30.743 --> 04:32.144
Dad, don't.
That's pathetic.

04:32.178 --> 04:34.146
Where's moose?
Your mother's side of the bed.

04:34.180 --> 04:37.182
Okay, pathetic or not,
let him hang with us.

04:37.217 --> 04:38.617
No.

04:38.651 --> 04:41.053
Here, take what's left
of the mask.

04:41.087 --> 04:43.222
It'll make your face
smooth as a baby's bottom.

04:48.861 --> 04:51.430
What?
Don't say baby to him.
I told you.

04:51.464 --> 04:53.198
Oh, I forgot.

04:53.233 --> 04:56.668
Maybe that mask is sucking
the brain out of your head.

04:56.703 --> 04:59.238
As long as it keep
my pores clean,

04:59.272 --> 05:01.440
I'm okay with that.

05:02.508 --> 05:04.176
I'll wash it off
in 10 minutes.

05:04.210 --> 05:06.712
Just hang in there.

05:06.746 --> 05:08.647
Then we'll do something
you want to do.

05:08.681 --> 05:09.915
What do you want to do?

05:09.949 --> 05:13.452
What do you usually do
when you have sleepovers?

05:13.486 --> 05:16.622
I've never had one.

05:16.656 --> 05:19.124
I'm shocked.
You're so much fun.

05:21.194 --> 05:22.294
This will be fun.

05:22.328 --> 05:24.730
This will be fun
if we end up having sex.

05:24.764 --> 05:28.100
No, this will be fun
not having sex.

05:28.134 --> 05:29.268
It's a sleepover.

05:29.302 --> 05:30.969
Yeah, that's great,
a sleepover.

05:31.004 --> 05:32.537
How about a sex-over?

05:32.572 --> 05:35.207
We agreed not to have sex
for a while, until we work
some things out.

05:35.241 --> 05:37.743
It's been a while,
and we've worked
some things out.

05:37.777 --> 05:39.311
Don't you think
we should reward ourselves

05:39.345 --> 05:40.512
With the progress
we've made?

05:40.546 --> 05:42.180
What progress?

05:42.215 --> 05:45.083
We both have agreed
that we couldn't possibly
decide at 17

05:45.118 --> 05:47.286
If we're ready to be together
for the rest of our lives.

05:47.320 --> 05:51.390
We have.
You got your way on that.

05:51.424 --> 05:53.425
You were right about that,

05:53.459 --> 05:55.694
And maybe you're right
about the reward.

05:55.728 --> 05:57.529
Yeah, we deserve
a little reward for that.

06:02.602 --> 06:04.336
And I said
that I would entertain

06:04.370 --> 06:06.238
The idea
of possibly marrying you

06:06.272 --> 06:08.206
At some time
in the distant future.

06:08.241 --> 06:09.608
That wasn't easy for me,

06:09.642 --> 06:12.077
But I understand where
you're coming from
on that.

06:12.111 --> 06:14.112
Okay, and we get a reward
for that, too.

06:18.284 --> 06:19.518
That's all I get for that?

06:19.552 --> 06:21.987
We-- that's all we get
for that.

06:23.256 --> 06:25.123
okay, come here.

06:28.828 --> 06:31.563
And I agree that if we did
get married someday,

06:31.597 --> 06:33.398
That I would consider
having another child

06:33.433 --> 06:34.666
If we both wanted a child,

06:34.701 --> 06:36.168
And the marriage was stable

06:36.202 --> 06:39.304
And we were financially
and emotionally ready
to have a child.

06:39.339 --> 06:41.540
We get a really big reward
for that.

06:45.411 --> 06:46.712
All right, let's just do it.

06:46.746 --> 06:49.247
No, we're not going
to just do it.

06:49.282 --> 06:50.682
Doing it is a reward we get

06:50.717 --> 06:53.585
When we decide to get married
and have a family

06:53.619 --> 06:55.187
And be together
the rest of our lives.

06:55.221 --> 06:57.489
Adrian, don't tell me
you don't want to do it
right now

06:57.523 --> 06:59.424
Regardless of what's going
to happen in the future.

06:59.459 --> 07:00.759
Of course I do,

07:00.793 --> 07:03.195
But I'm afraid
that if I do,

07:03.229 --> 07:06.131
Then we'll lose
all the progress
we've made so far.

07:06.165 --> 07:07.566
Adrian.

07:07.600 --> 07:10.502
Why don't I go downstairs

07:10.536 --> 07:12.237
And pop some corn

07:12.271 --> 07:13.939
And we can put in a movie.

07:15.641 --> 07:18.110
Okay. Be right back.

07:21.614 --> 07:24.416
And this is the bedroom.

07:24.450 --> 07:26.651
Oh, I see.

07:28.000 --> 07:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:41.134 --> 07:43.735
Sorry.
That's okay.
You can check it.

07:43.770 --> 07:45.170
I know who it is.
It's fine.

07:45.204 --> 07:46.905
Okay.

07:50.643 --> 07:53.211
believe me, it's fine.

07:56.249 --> 07:57.282
Where were we?

07:57.316 --> 08:00.385
Do you need to take
that call?

08:00.420 --> 08:02.154
If you need to take
the call, it's--

08:02.188 --> 08:03.355
I don't.

08:03.389 --> 08:05.924
Okay.

08:10.963 --> 08:13.765
You don't have a girlfriend,
do you?

08:13.800 --> 08:16.168
Yes, as a matter of fact,
I do. You.

08:17.603 --> 08:19.104
No, it's my mother.

08:19.138 --> 08:21.173
Ever since my brother died,
we call each other
every night.

08:21.207 --> 08:22.908
Oh, you should call her.

08:22.942 --> 08:26.144
I think it's about time
I stop that little ritual.
Don't you?

08:26.179 --> 08:27.212
I'll call in the morning.

08:27.246 --> 08:28.380
All right, if you want.

08:28.414 --> 08:30.215
I mean,
if you want to call her,
it's fine.

08:30.249 --> 08:31.583
Hmm, let me think about this.

08:31.617 --> 08:34.285
Uh, call my mother
on the phone

08:34.320 --> 08:36.154
Or have sex with you?

08:36.188 --> 08:37.422
Hmm.

08:37.457 --> 08:39.491
Or we could have sex

08:39.525 --> 08:41.092
While you talk
to your mother on the phone.

08:41.126 --> 08:44.129
a jewish boy's dream.

08:45.198 --> 08:46.264
Really?

08:46.299 --> 08:47.666
No.

09:21.701 --> 09:22.834
Hi.

09:22.869 --> 09:24.369
Just wanted to say good night.

09:24.403 --> 09:25.837
Good night, jack.

09:25.872 --> 09:28.206
Are you sure you don't want
to change your mind?

09:28.241 --> 09:30.075
I don't want to change my mind.

09:30.109 --> 09:31.076
Okay, grace.

09:31.110 --> 09:32.077
Good night, jack.

09:32.111 --> 09:33.712
You okay with your mom
not being there?

09:33.746 --> 09:35.413
I could come over
and just stay downstairs
in the living room,

09:35.448 --> 09:36.414
Sleep on the couch?

09:36.449 --> 09:38.183
It's a funny thing.

09:38.217 --> 09:40.552
My parents used to let
tom and I stay here
by ourselves once in a while

09:40.586 --> 09:42.687
When they were gone,
and we were fine,

09:42.722 --> 09:46.725
But it just feels different
now with my dad being gone.

09:46.759 --> 09:48.193
I always thought
if something went wrong,

09:48.227 --> 09:50.195
He would just run home
and save me.

09:50.229 --> 09:51.496
I'd save you.

09:51.531 --> 09:53.231
I'd run over
and save you, grace...

09:53.266 --> 09:54.266
If anything happened.

09:54.300 --> 09:56.234
It's okay.

09:56.269 --> 09:57.636
I can take care of myself.

09:57.670 --> 09:59.037
Good night, jack.

10:24.931 --> 10:27.299
Mmm, okay, okay,
we have to stop.

10:27.333 --> 10:29.401
Stop? What is this word stop?

10:29.435 --> 10:31.336
Uh, alto, alto.

10:31.370 --> 10:33.638
No alto.
Go, go, go, home run.

10:33.673 --> 10:35.307
No, no, no, no.
No homeruns, maria.

10:35.341 --> 10:37.175
We've agreed to be friends.

10:37.209 --> 10:39.177
We agree to friends in Italy.
This is america.

10:39.211 --> 10:41.446
In america you can do anything.
You can be anyone.

10:41.480 --> 10:42.714
Let's be lovers.

10:44.317 --> 10:47.152
No, I can't.
I just can't.

10:47.186 --> 10:48.720
You can if you want.

10:48.754 --> 10:50.455
Trust me,
a part of me wants.

10:50.489 --> 10:52.490
I bet I know which part.

10:52.525 --> 10:54.159
Maria, stop, please.

10:54.193 --> 10:55.260
Beno, no stop, please.

10:57.296 --> 10:59.898
What's the matter, benito?
You don't want to make love
to me tonight?

10:59.932 --> 11:02.267
Tomorrow I go home, and you can
have your amy again.

11:02.301 --> 11:05.770
Hi, I'm ben's dad,
leo boykewich.

11:05.805 --> 11:08.206
Sausage king of america.

11:08.240 --> 11:10.208
I'm so happy to meet

11:10.242 --> 11:12.711
The father of my friend,
my ben.

11:12.745 --> 11:15.180
I didn't realize
you were here, ben.

11:16.449 --> 11:17.816
That's because I hide
in the closet

11:17.850 --> 11:20.051
Because ben, he is nervous
that he is caught by amy,

11:20.086 --> 11:21.886
Who's had a baby
with another man.

11:21.921 --> 11:23.254
Ridiculous, no?

11:23.289 --> 11:25.924
Even so,
amy is his girlfriend.

11:25.958 --> 11:28.526
What's a girlfriend--
a girl who is a friend?

11:28.561 --> 11:30.295
I'm his girlfriend, too.
Am I not?

11:30.329 --> 11:31.630
I really don't know.

11:31.664 --> 11:33.264
I'm sorry.
I don't even know your name.

11:33.299 --> 11:34.866
Maria, maria maccini.

11:34.900 --> 11:38.236
You're related
to rocco mancini?

11:38.270 --> 11:39.738
Si, my papa.

11:39.772 --> 11:42.607
Oh, he's a nice man--
rocco.

11:42.642 --> 11:44.142
And he's here with you
in california?

11:44.176 --> 11:45.977
Si, si, he's waiting
at the hotel.

11:46.012 --> 11:49.180
And he knows you're here
visiting ben.

11:49.215 --> 11:50.915
He loves ben.

11:50.950 --> 11:51.950
Uh, yeah, he does.

11:51.984 --> 11:53.485
Oh.

11:53.519 --> 11:54.719
That's nice.

11:54.754 --> 11:56.254
If I would've known you were
here, maria,

11:56.288 --> 11:58.790
I would've invited
your father over for a visit.

11:58.824 --> 12:02.060
But then benito and me,
we could not kiss,
not so much.

12:02.094 --> 12:05.764
Well, true, I guess.

12:05.798 --> 12:07.599
Maybe you can bring him
with you next time.

12:07.633 --> 12:10.902
In the meantime,
would you like our driver
to take you back to the hotel?

12:10.936 --> 12:12.003
It's getting late.

12:12.038 --> 12:13.204
Oh, mr. Leo boykewich,

12:13.239 --> 12:14.506
Thank you so much,

12:14.540 --> 12:18.476
But I want to say good-bye
to ben alone, solo.

12:19.845 --> 12:23.615
All right, I'll give you two
a few more minutes.

12:25.718 --> 12:27.152
Ben, could we, uh...

12:28.521 --> 12:30.555
I'll just be a second.

12:42.435 --> 12:44.235
Do you know who her father is?

12:44.270 --> 12:45.570
I've met him.

12:45.604 --> 12:47.072
Do you know who he is?

12:53.822 --> 12:56.991
I can't believe we're grocery
shopping at 00 at night.

12:57.025 --> 12:58.860
We should've stopped
on the way here,

12:58.894 --> 13:00.661
But don't worry.

13:00.696 --> 13:02.964
Mimsy's nurse will take
good care of john and robbie.

13:02.998 --> 13:04.399
They won't even miss us.
It will be fine.

13:04.433 --> 13:07.602
I know that.
That's why this is
so wonderful.

13:07.636 --> 13:08.736
It's like a dream,

13:08.771 --> 13:10.204
Almost as good as the beach,

13:10.239 --> 13:11.939
Only we don't have to watch
the babies.

13:11.974 --> 13:14.375
I can't believe
we're grocery shopping
at 11:00 at night.

13:14.410 --> 13:15.943
This is
really, really fun, mom.

13:15.978 --> 13:16.844
We should do this
all the time.

13:16.879 --> 13:17.912
Fun?

13:17.946 --> 13:19.947
I'm exhausted.

13:19.982 --> 13:20.982
I don't know
why you're exhausted.

13:21.016 --> 13:23.718
I drove the whole way
to mimsy's.

13:23.752 --> 13:27.088
Well, you're still
a relatively new driver, amy.

13:27.122 --> 13:29.023
In between keeping
my eyes on your driving

13:29.057 --> 13:31.125
And the babies
and then dealing with mimsy,

13:31.160 --> 13:32.860
Really, I'm exhausted.

13:32.895 --> 13:33.895
We can't spend all night
in here.

13:33.929 --> 13:35.096
Mimsy's doing great.

13:35.130 --> 13:36.764
No, she's not.

13:36.799 --> 13:39.801
They have an overnight nurse
staying with her for a reason.

13:39.835 --> 13:42.003
She's beginning to forget
who she is, amy.

13:42.037 --> 13:43.805
Well, I'm beginning
to forget who I am.

13:50.345 --> 13:51.712
Did you just see that?

13:51.747 --> 13:52.980
Yeah, I saw that.

13:53.015 --> 13:54.982
Mom, he doesn't know
who I am.

13:55.017 --> 13:56.551
He doesn't know
anything about me.

13:56.585 --> 13:57.952
Well, you don't know
anything about him.

13:57.986 --> 13:59.687
I know he was looking at me,

13:59.721 --> 14:03.057
And not in that "look
at that poor teenage mother"
kind of way.

14:03.091 --> 14:05.726
Look,
just go find some cereal

14:05.761 --> 14:07.528
Or the guy if
that's what you want to do.

14:07.563 --> 14:10.064
I think I will.
I mean, it's not like
I'm cheating on ben.

14:10.098 --> 14:11.833
I'm just having
a little fun, right?

14:11.867 --> 14:13.100
Right.

14:13.135 --> 14:14.469
That's what this trip
is all about,

14:14.503 --> 14:16.637
You and me finding
the fuin life again.

14:23.245 --> 14:25.813
Well, hello there.
I heard you were here.

14:25.848 --> 14:26.814
Oh, my god.

14:26.849 --> 14:27.982
Oh, my god?

14:28.016 --> 14:29.684
You have no idea

14:29.718 --> 14:31.118
How many times I've dreamt
about making so that

14:31.153 --> 14:32.453
When we were dating
in high school.

14:32.488 --> 14:34.856
under different circumstances,
of course.

14:34.890 --> 14:36.491
Shh.
What?

14:36.525 --> 14:37.592
I waited
until she walked away.

14:37.626 --> 14:38.926
Is that your daughter?

14:38.961 --> 14:41.028
Yeah, and I don't want
to have to explain
things to her.

14:41.063 --> 14:43.998
You have no idea
how complicated
my life is already.

14:44.032 --> 14:45.500
I heard you have
a new boyfriend.

14:45.534 --> 14:47.368
You and him moving into
the old norman house?

14:47.402 --> 14:48.970
That's the house
you renovated, right?

14:49.004 --> 14:50.171
No, we're not moving there,

14:50.205 --> 14:51.806
And anyway that's over.

14:51.840 --> 14:54.442
Yeah, I heard.
But you're back here,
so I thought--

14:54.476 --> 14:55.776
I'm just visiting
with my mom.

14:55.811 --> 14:58.079
Amy and I wanted to get away
for a few days.

14:58.113 --> 14:59.680
You have to go now.

14:59.715 --> 15:00.848
Okay? Just-- just go.

15:00.883 --> 15:02.083
Not before you kiss me.

15:02.117 --> 15:03.818
I can't kiss you.

15:03.852 --> 15:04.952
I'm married.

15:04.987 --> 15:07.255
No, you're not.

15:07.289 --> 15:10.625
No, I'm not, but I'm back
with my husband.

15:10.659 --> 15:11.759
Yeah, kind of, sort of,

15:11.793 --> 15:13.628
But you and him had
that big fight over the baby,

15:13.662 --> 15:15.229
So I thought maybe
that's why you're here.

15:15.264 --> 15:16.564
You want to get back
with your old boyfriend.

15:16.598 --> 15:18.866
Not me,
your other old boyfriend,

15:18.901 --> 15:20.268
Your more recent old boyfriend.

15:20.302 --> 15:22.703
I forgot what it was like
living in a small town.

15:22.738 --> 15:24.272
Small town nothing.

15:24.306 --> 15:26.607
You should pay more attention
to what you write in the emails
to my brother

15:26.642 --> 15:28.142
Because he forwards
all those to me-- yeah--

15:28.176 --> 15:30.144
Ever since you guys ran
into each other in chicago.

15:30.178 --> 15:31.479
He does not.

15:31.513 --> 15:33.915
He comes across
as such a saint.

15:33.949 --> 15:35.316
I can't believe he'd do that.

15:35.350 --> 15:37.718
Not would. Does.
He does do it.

15:37.753 --> 15:39.487
Now, enough small talk.
Come on, kiss me.

15:39.521 --> 15:40.755
Absolutely not.

15:40.789 --> 15:42.723
Come on, let's just see
if we still have it.

15:44.660 --> 15:45.626
You know you want to.

15:47.296 --> 15:49.196
They make the pimento cheese
here in the store.

15:49.231 --> 15:51.132
Do they?
Right here in the store?

15:51.166 --> 15:52.400
That's totally awesome.

15:52.434 --> 15:55.303
Yeah, it is...
Totally awesome.

15:55.337 --> 15:56.771
Do you like pimento cheese?

15:56.805 --> 15:58.706
I don't know if I've ever had
pimento cheese.

15:58.740 --> 16:01.676
Well, perhaps we can make some
pimento cheese sandwiches

16:01.710 --> 16:02.877
And go on a picnic tomorrow.

16:02.911 --> 16:05.846
Oh, tomorrow?
I don't know if--

16:05.881 --> 16:06.881
Are you busy tomorrow?

16:06.915 --> 16:08.449
I'm here visiting
my grandmother.

16:08.483 --> 16:10.084
Yeah, I know.
My dad told me.

16:10.118 --> 16:12.954
He pointed you out to me.
It was a good point.

16:12.988 --> 16:14.889
Wait, what?
He knows your mom.

16:14.923 --> 16:16.757
They were
high-school sweethearts.

16:16.792 --> 16:18.759
There you are.
I was looking for you, amy.

16:18.794 --> 16:21.262
Amy? I'm nicolette.

16:21.296 --> 16:24.832
This is jimmy,
jimmy nash.
Nash?

16:24.866 --> 16:25.833
Yeah, that nash.

16:29.071 --> 16:30.838
Amy, nicolette,
whatever your name is,
we've got to go.

16:30.872 --> 16:32.773
Are we all going?

16:32.808 --> 16:34.842
We were thinking that you two
might want to have a pizza
or something.

16:34.876 --> 16:37.812
- Feel like a pizza?
- Yeah, I feel like a pizza.

16:37.846 --> 16:40.081
No, we can't.
Nicolette, we've got to go.

16:40.115 --> 16:44.418
- Can I call you?
- I don't know. Here.

16:45.854 --> 16:48.389
You can call me if you want,

16:48.423 --> 16:50.591
And if you're going to be here
for a while.

16:57.566 --> 16:59.600
Good night.

16:59.635 --> 17:01.469
Night.
Night.

17:03.405 --> 17:05.106
All right, so my name is amy.

17:05.140 --> 17:07.340
I use nicolette sometimes.

17:07.376 --> 17:09.310
It's a middle name,
nicolette,

17:09.344 --> 17:12.413
Or I wish it was
my middle name.

17:12.446 --> 17:14.515
Anyway.
Why don't I
just call you pimento?

17:14.549 --> 17:15.650
After the cheese?

17:15.684 --> 17:16.751
All right.

17:19.921 --> 17:21.856
Let's just leave this stuff here
and come back tomorrow.

17:28.814 --> 17:30.248
All right, do your thing.

17:34.153 --> 17:38.156
Moose!
Hola.

17:38.190 --> 17:39.957
Yeah, hola.

17:39.992 --> 17:40.825
Want a drink?

17:40.859 --> 17:42.360
Oh, yeah.
Gate's unlocked.

17:42.394 --> 17:44.262
Just jump over the wall.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.466
Better than jumping
through hoops.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.334
I've done my share.

17:54.773 --> 17:56.040
That's what I call neat.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.909
That's what I call
the old neighborhood.

17:57.943 --> 18:00.411
That's a fancy neighborhood.

18:00.446 --> 18:01.412
What's going on?

18:01.447 --> 18:02.814
Ricky's over.

18:02.848 --> 18:04.315
Not that amy needs
to know that.

18:04.349 --> 18:05.650
I'm not going to tell her.

18:05.684 --> 18:07.285
He's not exactly speaking
to me right now--

18:07.319 --> 18:08.319
She, or her mother.

18:08.353 --> 18:10.288
Ann still gone?
Yep.

18:10.322 --> 18:12.890
That's going to be some
conversation when she gets back.

18:12.925 --> 18:13.925
Yep.

18:13.959 --> 18:16.360
You actually asked her
if the baby is yours?

18:16.395 --> 18:18.429
It's just a question.
I don't know why she got
so upset about it,

18:18.464 --> 18:19.497
Unless it's not my baby.

18:19.531 --> 18:20.765
Or unless it is.

18:20.799 --> 18:22.133
Why would she be upset
if it is?

18:22.167 --> 18:23.868
Uh, because if it is,

18:23.902 --> 18:26.437
You falsely accuse her
of having someone else's baby.

18:26.472 --> 18:27.638
I've seen guys murdered
for that.

18:27.673 --> 18:29.173
I'm not accusing her
of anything.

18:29.208 --> 18:30.208
I was just asking.

18:30.242 --> 18:32.810
George, that's not something
you ask your wife.

18:32.845 --> 18:34.812
She's not my wife.
We're divorced.

18:34.847 --> 18:36.347
I'd like to get married again.

18:36.381 --> 18:37.882
I mean, if little robbie's mine.

18:37.916 --> 18:39.250
Does it matter?
Yeah, it matters.

18:39.284 --> 18:41.219
If he's not my baby,
he's just a constant reminder

18:41.253 --> 18:43.621
That ann cheated.
But you cheated first.

18:43.655 --> 18:45.490
Yeah, but the person
I cheated with
is not having my baby.

18:45.524 --> 18:47.258
That would be cindy.

18:49.027 --> 18:50.027
Moose!

18:50.062 --> 18:52.563
George, would you and ann
be together

18:52.598 --> 18:54.265
If she hadn't gotten
pregnant?

18:54.299 --> 18:55.399
I don't know,

18:55.434 --> 18:56.567
But the fact is she had
a baby,

18:56.602 --> 18:57.735
And I don't know
if he's my son.

18:57.769 --> 18:59.337
Maybe you could look at it
this way.

18:59.371 --> 19:00.605
Whether or not he's your son,

19:00.639 --> 19:01.939
He brought you and ann
back together,

19:01.974 --> 19:03.307
So maybe it was just meant
to be.

19:03.342 --> 19:04.709
Or if he's not my son,

19:04.743 --> 19:06.010
He's what's going to drive us
apart for good.

19:06.044 --> 19:07.612
Maybe that's what's
meant to be.

19:07.646 --> 19:09.380
I thought we agreed all us men
were going to support
each other.

19:09.414 --> 19:10.982
I'm trying.

19:11.016 --> 19:12.216
Well, how would you feel
if my sleeping cindy

19:12.251 --> 19:14.285
Is what brought you and cindy
and adrian together

19:14.319 --> 19:15.286
And living next door to me.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.621
How would you feel?

19:16.655 --> 19:19.056
I'm not quite sure
I understand your logic
on that one, george.

19:19.091 --> 19:21.959
And would you quit bringing up
cindy and her indiscretions?

19:21.994 --> 19:23.761
Oh, yeah.

19:23.795 --> 19:26.264
Heard about that job
in new york.

19:26.298 --> 19:27.265
Moose!

19:27.299 --> 19:29.267
Darn dog.

19:34.473 --> 19:35.907
Is that george?

19:35.941 --> 19:37.575
Hmm?

19:37.609 --> 19:39.076
I think I heard george.

19:39.111 --> 19:40.912
Can I go home now?

19:40.946 --> 19:42.013
If we're not going to have sex,

19:42.047 --> 19:43.614
I just want to wake up
in my own bed.

19:43.649 --> 19:45.716
All right, whatever.

19:47.753 --> 19:49.153
Thanks, adrian.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.488
Thanks a lot.

19:50.522 --> 19:52.423
Mm-mmm.
There are no more rewards.

19:52.457 --> 19:53.925
All right.

19:58.263 --> 20:00.131
You're welcome to stay.
I don't think so.

20:00.165 --> 20:02.133
Maybe not having sex
will be better next time,

20:02.167 --> 20:03.668
But, frankly,
I find it a littleoring.

20:06.371 --> 20:10.241
Would it be more exciting
if amy came back home
with your son?

20:10.275 --> 20:12.343
That's why you said you'd stay
over here, isn't it?

20:12.377 --> 20:14.111
That wasn't the entire reason.

20:14.146 --> 20:18.182
Okay, if we were having sex
and you heard amy's car
in the driveway,

20:18.217 --> 20:19.850
Would you jump up
and run over there?

20:19.885 --> 20:22.620
No, I'm not a complete jerk.
I'd wait until I was finished.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.190
We-- until we were finished.

20:26.225 --> 20:28.426
Oh, thank you for that.
You're a real gentleman.

20:28.460 --> 20:31.229
Look, amy hasn't called me,
and she has my son with her.

20:31.263 --> 20:33.364
I want to see my son.
I want to see john.

20:33.398 --> 20:35.333
This is as long
as he's ever been away
from me,

20:35.367 --> 20:36.434
And I don't like it.

20:36.468 --> 20:38.369
I told you to do
something about it.

20:38.403 --> 20:40.271
My dad said he would help you.

20:40.305 --> 20:42.373
You should try to get
joint custody in writing.

20:42.407 --> 20:44.375
Maybe I will.
Good.

20:44.409 --> 20:46.611
All right,
I'm going home.

20:46.645 --> 20:48.980
Good-bye.

20:52.451 --> 20:55.453
I'll call you if I see her
drive up in the driveway, okay?

20:55.487 --> 20:58.322
Thanks, adrian.
Yeah, you're welcome.

20:58.357 --> 21:01.993
You know, I'm really trying
to make this no-sex thing work.

21:02.027 --> 21:03.828
Yeah, I know.

21:06.498 --> 21:09.900
Good night.
I love you.

21:11.570 --> 21:13.304
I love you, too.

21:22.114 --> 21:24.181
So you've had sex.

21:24.216 --> 21:28.085
Yeah, I don't want to have sex
just to have sex.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.253
I want a boyfriend,

21:29.288 --> 21:32.657
But gay relationships
in high school are just--

21:32.691 --> 21:34.292
I don't know, impossible.

21:34.326 --> 21:35.893
Why's that?

21:35.927 --> 21:37.762
Even if I find a guy who's
as comfortable as I am

21:37.796 --> 21:39.730
With being gay,

21:39.765 --> 21:42.733
It's not likely his family's
going to be comfortable as mine
with it,

21:42.768 --> 21:45.703
And it's not likely the whole
high school is going to be
comfortable

21:45.737 --> 21:49.240
With a couple of gay guys
openly making out
in the hallways.

21:49.274 --> 21:51.342
You don't give people
a lot of credit, do you?

21:51.376 --> 21:55.346
No, I don't.

21:55.380 --> 22:00.084
I watched my brothers go
through a lot of "crapola"
in high school.

22:00.118 --> 22:03.087
I'd like to avoid that
if I can.

22:03.121 --> 22:05.222
Even if that means
not getting what you want?

22:05.257 --> 22:07.224
Not getting a boyfriend
you can make out with
in the hallways?

22:07.259 --> 22:10.728
I refuse to make getting
what I want that important.

22:10.762 --> 22:13.164
I just want to take it
one day at a time

22:13.198 --> 22:14.899
And see what happens.

22:14.933 --> 22:18.269
I don't need to focus
on getting into a relationship.

22:18.303 --> 22:20.504
I mean, if it happens, fine.

22:20.539 --> 22:24.342
If it doesn't, well,
I'm 15.

22:24.376 --> 22:25.643
It'll happen eventually.

22:25.677 --> 22:27.244
Are your brothers
in relationships?

22:27.279 --> 22:30.348
Yep, my parents
and I don't like
one of the partners,

22:30.382 --> 22:31.949
But the other one
we like a lot.

22:31.983 --> 22:33.551
What's wrong
with the one you don't like?

22:33.585 --> 22:35.252
He cheated on my brother.

22:35.287 --> 22:37.955
My brother got over it,
but the rest of us can't.

22:37.989 --> 22:39.623
He's probably
still cheating on him

22:39.658 --> 22:41.192
Even though he says he isn't.

22:41.226 --> 22:43.394
You know, once you go
down that road--
yeah.

22:43.428 --> 22:48.199
Oh, right, I forgot.
I'm sorry.

22:48.233 --> 22:51.736
So, you know, with everything
that happened with your parents,

22:51.770 --> 22:53.404
Does that put you off
from wanting to have sex?

22:53.438 --> 22:56.507
No, it was amy's description
of what happened at band camp

22:56.541 --> 22:59.343
That put me off having sex
anytime soon,

22:59.378 --> 23:00.544
That and the baby.

23:00.579 --> 23:02.246
You don't think
your first time having sex

23:02.280 --> 23:05.082
Is going to be like amy's
first time having sex.

23:05.117 --> 23:08.419
I don't think it's possible
to have meaningful sex
in high school.

23:08.453 --> 23:10.054
Whether it's gay or straight.

23:10.088 --> 23:12.156
Let's get boyfriends.

23:12.190 --> 23:13.657
I tried. I'm not into it.

23:13.692 --> 23:15.192
You don't like mark?

23:17.028 --> 23:19.363
Well, I think he's going out
with someone else.

23:19.398 --> 23:22.266
Thank god.
No, no, don't say that.

23:22.300 --> 23:23.868
I lied.

23:23.902 --> 23:25.970
I don't think our friendship's
ready for boyfriends.

23:26.004 --> 23:27.238
Yeah, I agree.

23:33.311 --> 23:34.345
Tom?

23:34.379 --> 23:35.846
It's me.
Tom let me in.

23:35.881 --> 23:37.882
Ugh, jack.

23:47.492 --> 23:49.293
I had a feeling
you were cheating on me,

23:49.327 --> 23:50.294
And now I know.

23:55.033 --> 23:56.267
Whatever.

24:04.509 --> 24:06.644
You don't want anything?
You okay?

24:06.678 --> 24:08.379
Mmm, I'm better than okay.

24:08.413 --> 24:10.181
I'll say.

24:12.317 --> 24:14.051
Go-- mom.

24:15.420 --> 24:18.489
This is kathleen,
the woman I was telling you
about.

24:18.523 --> 24:20.224
This is the widow?

24:20.258 --> 24:21.325
Ma.

24:21.359 --> 24:22.793
I thought you were dead,
jeffrey.

24:22.828 --> 24:24.261
You didn't answer the phone.

24:24.296 --> 24:25.362
No, I didn't.

24:25.397 --> 24:26.530
I was going to call you
in the morning.

24:26.565 --> 24:28.399
He should've answered
the phone.

24:28.433 --> 24:29.867
I told him to answer
the phone.

24:29.901 --> 24:31.402
Good.

24:31.436 --> 24:33.304
I like you.

24:33.338 --> 24:35.606
You know, your husband
and my son

24:35.640 --> 24:37.241
Have only been gone six months,

24:37.275 --> 24:38.476
But I like you.

24:38.510 --> 24:40.044
Life goes on.

24:40.078 --> 24:41.479
You have children?

24:41.513 --> 24:44.548
Yes, yes, I have a son
that we adopted,

24:44.583 --> 24:45.583
And I have a daughter.

24:45.617 --> 24:47.518
You want more?
Ma.

24:47.552 --> 24:50.120
Just something to think about.

24:50.155 --> 24:52.756
That's all I'm saying.
Good night.

24:55.327 --> 24:59.230
And next time,
pick up the phone,
or you know what'll happen.

25:05.270 --> 25:06.904
I'm so embarrassed.

25:06.938 --> 25:08.305
Oh, no, no, no,
don't be, don't be.

25:08.340 --> 25:09.607
She's a liberal democrat,

25:09.641 --> 25:11.408
You know, no judgment

25:11.443 --> 25:13.911
Unless you're a republican.

25:16.114 --> 25:17.181
No.

25:17.215 --> 25:18.182
yes.

25:19.851 --> 25:23.287
Oh, well, I'm glad we had sex
before I found that out.

25:24.623 --> 25:26.056
Republican? Really?

25:26.091 --> 25:27.291
But I voted for obama.

25:27.325 --> 25:28.659
Oh, so you're a cheater, too.

25:34.366 --> 25:36.267
I cheated on my first husband.

25:36.301 --> 25:37.801
And the republicans.

25:37.836 --> 25:40.337
No, I want to tell you this.

25:40.372 --> 25:41.305
You sure?

25:44.075 --> 25:46.043
What have I done?

25:46.077 --> 25:47.411
What have I done?

25:47.445 --> 25:48.679
What have you done?

25:48.713 --> 25:50.014
I'm an idiot.

25:50.048 --> 25:51.181
I never should've asked maria
to come.

25:51.216 --> 25:53.717
It's just that it's
her last day here,

25:53.752 --> 25:55.052
And she came
all this way to see me,

25:55.086 --> 25:57.187
And she's just--
she's so much fun.

25:57.222 --> 26:01.959
I mean, she's full of life,
and she's-- she's fun.

26:01.993 --> 26:05.262
You mean, compared to amy,
who has to go to school,
work, and raise a son.

26:05.297 --> 26:07.031
Yeah.

26:07.065 --> 26:09.199
Well, you can't just base
a relationship on fun.

26:09.234 --> 26:10.734
Why not?

26:10.769 --> 26:12.636
I feel like an old married man
who just saw the light.

26:12.671 --> 26:14.438
Oh, I don't think
you've seen the light yet.

26:14.472 --> 26:15.973
Fun doesn't last.

26:16.007 --> 26:17.107
Cooking does.

26:18.243 --> 26:19.810
It's what my mom says.

26:19.844 --> 26:22.146
About me?
Sometimes.

26:22.180 --> 26:23.647
I can cook, so there.

26:23.682 --> 26:25.616
Yeah, maria can cook, too.

26:25.650 --> 26:27.284
That's not going to last.

26:27.319 --> 26:29.219
I don't know if I care.

26:29.254 --> 26:31.455
Oh, jeez,
what are you going to do,
move to bologna?

26:31.489 --> 26:34.224
No, I'll just stay here
with amy.

26:34.259 --> 26:36.527
Oh, great, that's
a lovely attitude to have
about a woman.

26:36.561 --> 26:38.796
I'll just stay with amy,

26:38.830 --> 26:41.031
But I'd rather be with maria.

26:41.066 --> 26:42.299
Well, it's the truth.

26:42.334 --> 26:44.835
I don't know what the truth is

26:44.869 --> 26:46.870
Other than I want a sex life.

26:46.905 --> 26:49.273
You know what?
This war in my brain--

26:49.307 --> 26:50.774
This "break up with amy."
"no, don't break up with her.

26:50.809 --> 26:52.209
"yeah, break up with her."

26:52.243 --> 26:54.178
It's become a full-time war.

26:54.212 --> 26:56.313
I need a wartime consigliore.

27:04.556 --> 27:06.724
Ben? What's going on?

27:06.758 --> 27:07.992
Sorry to call you so late.

27:08.026 --> 27:09.593
I just really need
to talk to you

27:09.628 --> 27:11.128
Even though I know
you told ricky

27:11.162 --> 27:12.262
That you wouldn't talk to me.

27:12.297 --> 27:15.165
That's okay.
He's not here.

27:21.439 --> 27:25.075
So amy's out of town?

27:25.110 --> 27:26.810
And adrian?

27:26.845 --> 27:28.312
We're still trying to work
things out,

27:28.346 --> 27:31.615
So this can't be
anything serious
because I love adrian.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.751
Yeah, yeah, I know,
and I don't care.

27:33.785 --> 27:37.287
I don't want this to be
anything serious anyway.

27:37.322 --> 27:39.056
You're not a serious guy.

27:39.090 --> 27:40.791
Not tonight I'm not.

27:51.990 --> 27:53.524
Let me help you.

27:53.558 --> 27:55.025
Oh, I got it, dad.
It's okay.

27:55.059 --> 27:57.127
No, you don't got it.

27:57.161 --> 27:59.930
Come here, john.

28:01.766 --> 28:04.535
How's my grandson?
How's my daughter?

28:04.569 --> 28:07.738
Me? Oh, I'm fine.
I really am.

28:07.772 --> 28:09.306
Where's your mom?
Where's robbie?

28:09.340 --> 28:10.741
They're still at mimsy's.

28:10.775 --> 28:13.176
We stayed at a beach resort
enjoying ourselves

28:13.211 --> 28:14.411
For a couple of days,

28:14.445 --> 28:16.079
Then we drove over to mimsy's.

28:16.114 --> 28:17.614
Mom wanted to stay
a little longer,

28:17.649 --> 28:19.216
But I figured
I should get home.

28:19.250 --> 28:20.384
You weren't at mimsy's
all week?

28:20.418 --> 28:21.585
No, just yesterday.

28:21.619 --> 28:22.920
Mom and I needed a break

28:22.954 --> 28:24.121
So we went by the beach first.

28:24.155 --> 28:26.023
So you lied.
You and your mother lied.

28:26.057 --> 28:27.624
Like you don't lie?

28:27.659 --> 28:30.494
Come on, it was just the girls
having a little fun.

28:30.528 --> 28:32.763
It was more fun to keep it
a secret.

28:32.797 --> 28:35.465
Dad, you lie about things
all the time.

28:37.268 --> 28:40.003
Of course, your lies
are your business.

28:40.038 --> 28:41.405
And what lies would those be?

28:41.439 --> 28:43.774
The none-of-my-business lies.

28:46.110 --> 28:47.411
give me him.

28:50.214 --> 28:52.416
Welcome home, daughter.

28:52.450 --> 28:54.351
It's nice to be home, father.

28:56.321 --> 28:58.722
Wait a minute.
Wait just a darn minute.

29:00.325 --> 29:02.693
Amy-- amy juergens,
I want to talk to you.

29:02.727 --> 29:03.827
One second.

29:03.861 --> 29:05.929
Sorry.

29:05.964 --> 29:08.632
Wanted to put john down
while he was still sleepy
from the ride.

29:08.666 --> 29:09.900
Yeah, the ride.
Right there.

29:09.934 --> 29:11.435
That's what I want to talk
to you about.

29:11.469 --> 29:13.103
How did you get here?
I drove.

29:13.137 --> 29:15.339
Without a license?
I got my license.

29:15.373 --> 29:16.873
You got your driver's license
without me?

29:16.908 --> 29:18.875
Uh-huh. Mom took me
on the way to the beach.

29:18.910 --> 29:20.811
What's your mother driving?

29:20.845 --> 29:21.878
Mimsy's car.

29:21.913 --> 29:23.180
Mimsy isn't driving anymore.

29:23.214 --> 29:24.848
I see.

29:24.882 --> 29:25.882
So you drove the new car,

29:25.917 --> 29:27.551
All the way from mimsy's,
all by yourself.

29:27.585 --> 29:29.319
Mom gave me a note so I can
drive john in my car,

29:29.354 --> 29:32.589
My new car, the suv,
the one that david gave me,

29:32.624 --> 29:34.891
All the way from mimsy's,
all by myself,

29:34.926 --> 29:36.893
So it's legal with a note
for me to drive john.

29:36.928 --> 29:37.995
David's a giver.

29:38.029 --> 29:39.930
He's a real giver.

29:39.964 --> 29:41.865
I'd like to know if he gave
your mother anything.

29:43.067 --> 29:45.636
What, like-- like robbie?

29:45.670 --> 29:47.037
I don't know.
I don't' want to get involved.

29:47.071 --> 29:48.538
That's between you and mom.

29:48.573 --> 29:51.975
I waited 16 1/2 years
for you to be able to drive
a car,

29:52.010 --> 29:53.910
And you went to get your license
with your mother and not me?

29:53.945 --> 29:56.413
You get your first tampon
from your mother.

29:56.447 --> 29:57.848
You get your first license
from your dad,

29:57.882 --> 29:58.982
And I'm your dad.

29:59.017 --> 30:00.317
You sure about that?

30:06.024 --> 30:08.725
Seems like you
and your mother have
a lot of secrets these days.

30:08.760 --> 30:12.796
Yeah, well, you and ashley
have your secrets to,
so there you go.

30:26.210 --> 30:27.577
Hello?

30:27.612 --> 30:28.945
All right, she's home.

30:28.980 --> 30:30.047
Thanks.

30:30.081 --> 30:31.948
Are you going to go
over there?

30:31.983 --> 30:34.584
I thought I'd give you
a shot at her first
before I call ricky.

30:34.619 --> 30:36.253
I'm at work right now,
and so is he.

30:36.287 --> 30:38.622
Take a break and go
over there. Fix this.

30:38.656 --> 30:40.424
I don't know how
to fix it.

30:40.458 --> 30:42.025
I thought I wanted
to break up with her

30:42.060 --> 30:43.026
Until you talked me
out of it.

30:43.061 --> 30:44.294
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

30:44.328 --> 30:45.595
You're not going to break up
with amy

30:45.630 --> 30:47.798
For some girl
who lives half way
across the world.

30:47.832 --> 30:50.867
Even if there was no maria,
I'd still want to break up
with amy.

30:50.902 --> 30:54.004
Okay, now, ben,
you know you don't mean that.

30:54.038 --> 30:55.672
Okay? You love amy.

30:55.707 --> 30:57.607
You two have been
through so much together.

30:57.642 --> 30:59.876
Just hang in there
and give it another shot.

30:59.911 --> 31:02.112
You've worked so hard
at this relationship.

31:02.146 --> 31:04.347
That's just it.
I don't want to work
at a relationship.

31:04.382 --> 31:05.582
I just want to have fun.

31:05.616 --> 31:07.050
Grow up.

31:07.085 --> 31:09.252
Relationships
are not always fun,

31:09.287 --> 31:10.353
And after all this time

31:10.388 --> 31:11.555
You put in trying
to make it work,

31:11.589 --> 31:13.256
You really want to give up now?

31:13.291 --> 31:14.291
I don't know.

31:14.325 --> 31:16.693
I'm tired, confused.

31:16.728 --> 31:18.428
Besides she's going to break up
with me anyway

31:18.463 --> 31:20.697
Once she knows that my friend
from bologna's here.

31:20.732 --> 31:22.065
No, she's not.

31:22.100 --> 31:25.035
She might be a little jealous,

31:25.069 --> 31:26.169
But, hey, she's the one

31:26.204 --> 31:28.004
Who left and went out of town.

31:28.039 --> 31:30.507
You can't help it
if that's when maria
decided to come here.

31:30.541 --> 31:32.242
You and maria
are just friends.

31:32.276 --> 31:34.878
You and amy are
more than friends.

31:34.912 --> 31:39.349
You know, I bet you're justweekx
with amy.

31:39.383 --> 31:41.017
No, that's impossible.

31:41.052 --> 31:42.719
No, it's not.

31:42.754 --> 31:45.255
She just wants to know
that you really love her,

31:45.289 --> 31:48.291
And hey, absence
makes the heart grow fonder,

31:48.326 --> 31:51.661
So even if she is upset,
she'll get over it.

31:52.964 --> 31:55.632
I have to go.

31:55.666 --> 31:56.967
My dad.

31:57.001 --> 31:58.502
no cell phones!

32:02.940 --> 32:04.941
Hey.

32:04.976 --> 32:05.942
Was that ricky?

32:05.977 --> 32:07.144
It was ben.

32:07.178 --> 32:10.013
He asked me to call
if I saw amy come home.

32:10.047 --> 32:12.682
You know,
you might want to mind
your own business

32:12.717 --> 32:14.885
When it comes to people coming
and going from that house.

32:14.919 --> 32:16.286
It is my business.

32:16.320 --> 32:19.523
Adrian, I still think it's
in your best interest

32:19.557 --> 32:20.991
To make friends with amy,

32:21.025 --> 32:22.425
And if you keep spying on her,

32:22.460 --> 32:23.927
You're not going to make
friends with amy.

32:23.961 --> 32:25.028
I know.

32:25.062 --> 32:28.932
All right,
as long as you know.

32:28.966 --> 32:31.635
You haven't seen your mom
over there, have you?

32:31.669 --> 32:33.870
No, but if I do,
I'll let you know.

32:38.442 --> 32:40.310
She has no interest in george.

32:40.344 --> 32:41.878
I didn't say she did.

32:41.913 --> 32:43.747
Don't let her go to new york.

32:43.781 --> 32:44.881
Let?

32:44.916 --> 32:46.149
Don't let her go to new york?

32:46.184 --> 32:47.851
Listen, your mother's
not my property.

32:47.885 --> 32:48.885
She can do whatever she wants.

32:48.920 --> 32:49.986
That's ridiculous.

32:50.021 --> 32:51.054
She can't do
whatever she wants

32:51.088 --> 32:52.689
And be in a relationship
with you.

32:52.723 --> 32:54.691
You tell her that--
she wants you to tell her that.

32:54.725 --> 32:55.926
I don't know.

32:55.960 --> 32:59.095
I know.
Look, just do it, okay?

32:59.130 --> 33:00.931
I want you two
to stay together.

33:00.965 --> 33:02.232
I want you two to get married.

33:02.266 --> 33:04.935
Adrian, we don't always get
what we want.

33:04.969 --> 33:06.837
Okay, why do people think that?

33:06.871 --> 33:08.738
Yes, we can get what we want.

33:15.947 --> 33:18.014
Nice job.
Thanks.

33:18.049 --> 33:19.883
You've been working hard
all day.

33:19.917 --> 33:20.951
Yeah, I have.

33:20.985 --> 33:22.519
Trying to get your mind
off something?

33:22.553 --> 33:23.920
Like what?

33:23.955 --> 33:25.822
Like cheating
on your girlfriend.

33:25.857 --> 33:27.791
What makes you think
I was cheating
on my girlfriend?

33:27.825 --> 33:30.193
Someontripped the alarm
when they were leaving.

33:30.228 --> 33:33.430
Oh, I was over at adrian's.
I did that when I came back.

33:33.464 --> 33:35.332
It was really late.
Sorry.

33:35.366 --> 33:37.601
No, you would never do that.

33:37.635 --> 33:41.705
Someone else did that.
Someone leave in a hurry?

33:41.739 --> 33:44.875
Yes, I had someone over.
She stayed too late,

33:44.909 --> 33:47.878
And then she rushed out
before I could turn off
the alarm to let her out.

33:47.912 --> 33:49.813
You feel like crap,
don't you?

33:49.847 --> 33:51.948
No.
Yeah, you do.

33:51.983 --> 33:53.416
You don't want to cheat
on adrian.

33:53.451 --> 33:55.552
Adrian and I aren't doing
anything right now,

33:55.586 --> 33:57.020
So I have a reason to be
with someone else.

33:57.054 --> 33:58.121
It's not cheating.

33:58.155 --> 33:59.723
- A reason?
- Yeah.

33:59.757 --> 34:03.260
There's no reason.
There's only justification.

34:03.294 --> 34:05.729
You don't want to cheat
on the person you love.

34:05.763 --> 34:07.731
You just don't, so stop.

34:07.765 --> 34:10.233
Quit trying to figure it out
and just stop.

34:10.268 --> 34:13.637
No good can come of it.

34:13.670 --> 34:15.705
You think I'm not tempted
to cheat on my husband

34:15.739 --> 34:16.907
Every day I'm here?

34:16.940 --> 34:18.608
You see all the men come
in here,

34:18.643 --> 34:19.876
Flirting with me,

34:19.911 --> 34:21.578
Giving me their business cards,

34:21.612 --> 34:24.947
Offering me discounts
and favors and such.

34:24.982 --> 34:26.882
They just want sex.

34:26.918 --> 34:29.485
Yeah, I may have seen
that happen once or twice.

34:29.520 --> 34:30.687
All the time.

34:30.721 --> 34:31.788
Listen to me, kid.

34:31.822 --> 34:34.491
When you're driving your car
and you see a red light,

34:34.525 --> 34:36.927
Do you think about whether
or not you should stop,

34:36.960 --> 34:38.460
Or do you just stop?

34:38.496 --> 34:39.629
I just stop.

34:39.664 --> 34:40.730
Bingo.

34:45.569 --> 34:48.038
Hey, did amy call you?
She's back.

34:48.072 --> 34:50.706
Oh, great, and she
didn't even let me know.

34:50.741 --> 34:51.875
She's the mother of my son.

34:51.909 --> 34:53.543
I haven't seen my son
in five days,

34:53.577 --> 34:55.612
And she doesn't even have
the courtesy to call me.

34:55.646 --> 34:57.981
How do you know?
How do you know she's home?

34:58.015 --> 35:01.584
Uh, I asked adrian to call me
and let me know.

35:01.619 --> 35:03.753
I told you two to quit talking
to each other.

35:03.788 --> 35:04.788
I really needed
to talk to her.

35:04.822 --> 35:06.222
About?

35:06.257 --> 35:07.824
About breaking up with amy.

35:07.858 --> 35:08.925
You're pathetic.
You know that?

35:08.960 --> 35:10.694
If you want to break up
with amy, break up with her.

35:10.728 --> 35:12.662
And you don't want
to break up with amy,

35:12.697 --> 35:14.664
So just shut up
about it.
I can't.

35:14.699 --> 35:16.099
Her friends are going to tell
her about maria.

35:16.133 --> 35:17.434
I know they are,

35:17.468 --> 35:19.869
So I thought that I
should break up with her,

35:19.904 --> 35:21.371
Or I could let her
break up with me.

35:21.405 --> 35:23.039
Are? Her friends are going
to tell her about maria?

35:23.074 --> 35:26.142
How about have? They have
told her about maria,
don't you think?

35:26.177 --> 35:28.311
And they haven't,
ashley h.
She was there.

35:28.346 --> 35:29.779
I don't thin ashley
would say anything,

35:29.814 --> 35:31.915
And I'm not sure that amy's
talked to madison and lauren.

35:31.949 --> 35:33.850
It doesn't matter.
You're not going to have
a relationship

35:33.884 --> 35:35.585
With a girl in Italy,
okay?

35:35.619 --> 35:36.720
Maria's just a friend.

35:36.754 --> 35:39.055
You can have friends
and still be in love with amy.

35:39.090 --> 35:40.690
You've been with her
for over a year.

35:40.725 --> 35:42.859
You're not going to break up
after all the time you put in.

35:42.893 --> 35:45.028
That's pretty much
what adrian told me.

35:46.831 --> 35:48.365
I'm taking my break, bunny.

36:03.645 --> 36:07.815
- Hey, jack.
- Tom.

36:07.849 --> 36:09.783
- What's up, buddy?
- Oh, nothing, buddy.

36:09.818 --> 36:11.385
Just hoping grace
comes down

36:11.419 --> 36:13.120
To talk to me.
Really?

36:13.154 --> 36:15.189
Problems in graceland?

36:15.223 --> 36:16.290
I don't know.

36:16.324 --> 36:17.591
Maybe I could help.

36:17.626 --> 36:19.093
Is that a sincere offer?

36:19.127 --> 36:21.362
Because you know, tom,
any guy that goes
with your sister

36:21.396 --> 36:22.763
Is going to try something
with her,

36:22.797 --> 36:24.398
So you shouldn't hold that
against me.

36:24.432 --> 36:25.799
You're right.

36:25.834 --> 36:28.068
We used to be friends,
you and me.
I remember.

36:28.103 --> 36:30.537
Can we be friends, tom?
Can we be friends again?

36:30.572 --> 36:32.673
I think that
could be arranged.

36:32.707 --> 36:34.608
She's cheating on me,
isn't she?

36:34.643 --> 36:36.076
I'm afraid so.

36:36.111 --> 36:37.444
I knew it.

36:37.479 --> 36:39.279
Sorry about that.

36:39.314 --> 36:40.614
Do you know who the guy is?

36:40.649 --> 36:42.182
I know who it is.

36:42.217 --> 36:44.018
Who?
It will cost you.

36:44.052 --> 36:46.353
I thought we were friends.
We're friends.

36:46.388 --> 36:47.788
And I have to pay
for your information?

36:47.822 --> 36:50.557
If you want
information, yes.

36:50.592 --> 36:51.592
How much.

36:51.626 --> 36:54.194
How much you got?

36:56.297 --> 36:57.364
Thirty-five bucks.

36:57.399 --> 37:00.267
I think I see
another 20 in there.

37:00.301 --> 37:02.269
I see it.

37:02.303 --> 37:03.437
Fifty-five bucks.

37:03.471 --> 37:06.340
Ooh, pretty good.

37:06.374 --> 37:08.175
Who's she cheating
on me with, tom?

37:08.209 --> 37:09.543
Is it ricky?
Nope.

37:09.577 --> 37:10.844
Jason, lauren's brother?

37:10.879 --> 37:11.945
Nope.

37:11.980 --> 37:13.213
Well, who is it?

37:13.248 --> 37:17.217
She's having sex with herself
by herself. Ha.

37:38.907 --> 37:39.940
Yes.

37:41.342 --> 37:42.710
Hey, jeff.

37:42.744 --> 37:44.144
Hey, kathleen,
what are you doing?

37:44.179 --> 37:47.081
Oh, nothing much, really,
just cleaning the house.

37:47.115 --> 37:49.817
I thought about the stuff
you told me last night.

37:49.851 --> 37:53.287
I don't know why I did that.

37:53.321 --> 37:54.555
No, I do know
why I did that.

37:54.589 --> 37:56.790
Because I didn't tell marshall
for 15 years,

37:56.825 --> 37:58.192
And then he found out,

37:58.226 --> 37:59.426
And I wish I would've told him.

37:59.461 --> 38:01.261
Well, I wish
you hadn't have told me.

38:01.296 --> 38:02.896
Oh, really?

38:02.931 --> 38:04.565
No, I'm just messing with you.

38:04.599 --> 38:07.801
Okay, please don't do that

38:07.836 --> 38:10.237
Because I feel so vulnerable
around you.

38:10.271 --> 38:12.206
I like that, though.

38:12.240 --> 38:13.373
I like vulnerability,

38:13.408 --> 38:15.275
But you're also a very strong
woman, too, kathleen.

38:15.310 --> 38:16.276
I like that.

38:16.311 --> 38:17.444
I like you.

38:17.479 --> 38:20.380
I mean, I more than like you.

38:20.415 --> 38:22.049
I love you.

38:24.786 --> 38:25.953
Bye.

38:29.290 --> 38:30.257
He loves me?

38:31.960 --> 38:33.260
He loves me?

38:33.294 --> 38:34.595
Who?

38:36.297 --> 38:37.397
Jesus.

38:37.432 --> 38:40.234
Not jesus.
Jeff.

38:40.268 --> 38:42.169
It's jeff, right?

38:42.203 --> 38:44.204
You two are already telling
each other you love
each other?

38:44.239 --> 38:46.507
I didn't tell him.
He just told me right now
on the phone.

38:46.541 --> 38:48.242
Grace, be happy.

38:48.276 --> 38:49.576
Be happy for me.

38:49.611 --> 38:51.178
I'm happy for you when good
things happen to you.

38:51.212 --> 38:55.215
Actually, good things have
been happening to me lately.

38:55.250 --> 38:57.384
Oh?

38:57.418 --> 38:59.386
Oh.

38:59.420 --> 39:00.921
Awesome, huh?

39:00.955 --> 39:03.891
Oh, yeah. I'm so happy
I may never see jack again.

39:12.167 --> 39:15.369
Hey, ashley, I have something
I want to say to you.

39:15.403 --> 39:19.273
I'm very sorry
about the way I acted
when dad gave you this room.

39:19.307 --> 39:20.407
That was wrong of me.

39:20.441 --> 39:22.109
Yeah, I'll say.

39:22.143 --> 39:24.678
And I'm happy that you have
this room

39:24.712 --> 39:27.347
Because I have something
better than this room.

39:27.382 --> 39:31.418
I have a new suv,
and I have my driver's license.

39:31.452 --> 39:32.920
I have freedom.

39:32.954 --> 39:34.254
And a baby.

39:34.289 --> 39:35.722
Don't forget john.

39:37.025 --> 39:38.192
Right.

39:38.226 --> 39:39.893
And a baby.

39:39.928 --> 39:41.094
Mm-hmm.

39:41.129 --> 39:44.198
But I also have a new guy
in my life.

39:45.400 --> 39:46.567
I met someone,

39:46.601 --> 39:47.868
Someone named jimmy.

39:47.902 --> 39:51.205
Oh, god.
Jimmy, huh?

39:51.239 --> 39:52.739
Yeah, jimmy.

39:52.774 --> 39:54.908
Is he one of mimsy's friends?

39:54.943 --> 39:58.312
No, he's mom's
high-school boyfriend's son,
for your information.

39:58.346 --> 40:00.214
Mom's high-school boyfriend?

40:02.383 --> 40:04.084
That guy she was with
in chicago?

40:04.118 --> 40:05.853
That was who she was
with in chicago?

40:05.887 --> 40:07.921
Yeah, or didn't she
tell you that?

40:07.956 --> 40:10.123
No.
She told dad,
and he told me.

40:10.158 --> 40:12.893
I guess you and mom aren't
as close as dad and me.

40:12.927 --> 40:14.328
We tell each other everything,

40:14.362 --> 40:15.562
And now I'm going to tell him

40:15.597 --> 40:17.064
That she's pretending
to visit mimsy

40:17.098 --> 40:19.633
When she's really visiting
her old boyfriend.

40:19.667 --> 40:21.134
Is he the father of her baby?

40:21.169 --> 40:22.836
What?

40:22.871 --> 40:24.371
Is who the father of her baby?

40:24.405 --> 40:26.039
No one.

40:26.074 --> 40:27.808
No one that I know,
anyway.

40:32.280 --> 40:33.814
What's going on?

40:33.848 --> 40:35.983
Dad, if you want mom back,
you better get on the phone
right now.

40:38.186 --> 40:40.287
She's seeing her old
high-school boyfriend.

40:40.321 --> 40:41.955
That's what she's doing.

40:41.990 --> 40:43.891
She says she's seeing mimsy,
and, I don't know,
maybe she is,

40:43.925 --> 40:46.493
But she's seeing
her old high-school boyfriend.

40:46.527 --> 40:47.761
How do you know that?

40:47.795 --> 40:49.963
Because amy, apparently,
is seeing his son.

40:56.471 --> 40:59.072
Oh, hi.
I was going to call you.

40:59.107 --> 41:00.807
Were you?
Were you going to call me?

41:00.842 --> 41:02.276
Yes, I was going to call you.

41:02.310 --> 41:04.444
I just got home,
and I had to unpack
and do laundry.

41:04.479 --> 41:05.846
John is my son.

41:05.880 --> 41:07.180
Yes, and john is my son, too,

41:07.215 --> 41:09.283
And I felt like getting away
from you and ben

41:09.317 --> 41:10.784
And everyone else.

41:10.818 --> 41:12.352
You can get away all you want,
but not with my son.

41:12.387 --> 41:13.587
I want my son,

41:13.621 --> 41:15.055
And I'm going to go to court
to make sure

41:15.089 --> 41:16.924
You don't just take off
with him ever again.

41:16.958 --> 41:19.593
Adrian's dad
is going to help me.
I just want you to know that.

41:19.627 --> 41:21.395
I'm going to get
some kind of legal agreements

41:21.429 --> 41:24.765
So that john doesn't just
disappear anytime
you feel like taking off.

41:32.240 --> 41:33.240
Hello.

41:33.274 --> 41:35.175
Hi, adrian.

41:35.209 --> 41:36.610
Who is this?

41:36.644 --> 41:39.813
It's zoe from school.

41:39.847 --> 41:41.982
You slept
with my boyfriend mac.

41:42.016 --> 41:44.351
What?

41:44.385 --> 41:47.220
Mac has a girlfriend?
He didn't tell me.

41:47.255 --> 41:48.655
Whatever.

41:48.690 --> 41:50.157
Look, I just wanted you to know

41:50.191 --> 41:54.561
- That I returned the favor.
- I slept with ricky last night.

41:54.595 --> 41:56.997
Wait, what am I talking about?

41:57.031 --> 41:58.532
Not slept with.

41:58.566 --> 42:02.169
We had sex last night,
And it was great.
