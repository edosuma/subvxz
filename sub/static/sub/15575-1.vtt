She wouldn't tell me her husband's name.
She wouldn't even write it.

She knows not to speak
the names of the dead.

Zuwanie's murdered half the town.
How could it get any worse?

02:10.830 --> 02:13.856
With Zuwanie, he could murder the other half.

02:33.920 --> 02:37.253
No. Just us, they said.

02:38.925 --> 02:41.257
Xola's right, Philippe.

08:06.953 --> 08:11.151
Ladies and gentlemen,
we need to take a 15-minute recess now.

08:11.390 --> 08:14.450
We will advise you further
at the end of that time.

08:19.765 --> 08:21.790
We can't use the stairs.

08:25.204 --> 08:27.297

- Silvia?

08:29.208 --> 08:31.199
I'll be right back.

- Come on, Roland, it's my flutes.

08:37.917 --> 08:40.852
I have a lesson.
Don't make me drag it around.

08:41.053 --> 08:44.614

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen,

14:54.260 --> 14:57.661
the situation in Matobo
has now become critical.

14:57.897 --> 15:02.698
With Ajene Xola in hiding
and Kuman-Kuman in exile,

15:02.935 --> 15:06.871
Edmond Zuwanie has few domestic obstacles

15:07.072 --> 15:09.563
to his policy of ethnic cleansing.

15:09.808 --> 15:14.711
The Security Council therefore
must press for his immediate referral

15:14.914 --> 15:19.374
to the International Criminal Court
in The Hague.

15:23.188 --> 15:24.177
Miss Broome.

15:24.423 --> 15:28.120
I'm Jonathan Williams, Ambassador Harris's
adviser. We need you for a few minutes.

15:31.530 --> 15:35.933
- Which language?
- The Matoban ambassador. He'll speak Ku.

15:36.135 --> 15:38.660
- Ku?
- You speak the language, don't you?

15:46.345 --> 15:49.644
- Let's be clear, Mr Ambassador.
- [Silvia translates into Ku]

15:49.882 --> 15:53.909
The United States may not recognise the ICC
as a legitimate court,

15:54.153 --> 15:59.591
but we do not condone the methods
President Zuwanie uses against his people.

16:01.093 --> 16:03.323
[speaks Ku]

16:03.562 --> 16:06.156
Dr Zuwanie is an educator.

16:06.398 --> 16:10.334
He is... our teacher.

16:12.237 --> 16:15.866
But his opponents
engage in ever more ferocious acts.

16:16.108 --> 16:21.637
The partisans of both Kuman-Kuman
and Ajene Xola have become...

16:22.781 --> 16:24.146
terrorists.

16:27.920 --> 16:31.356
The French proposal
is a diplomatic headache for both of us.

16:35.027 --> 16:37.791
- What a predicament.
- It doesn't have to be.

16:38.030 --> 16:41.898
Dr Zuwanie wouldn't have to appear
before the International Criminal Court.

16:42.134 --> 16:45.103
Not if he were somewhere else.

16:47.439 --> 16:50.636
- Do you want him to resign?
- Tell him this.

16:51.877 --> 16:56.871
If he goes voluntarily, we're confident
the French proposal will be vetoed.

16:59.084 --> 17:01.678
[speaks English] You can tell him yourself.

17:02.588 --> 17:04.681
He will be here next Friday,

17:04.923 --> 17:08.689
exercising his right
to speak before the General Assembly,

17:08.926 --> 17:12.693
where he will announce
a new programme of democratic reform.

17:12.931 --> 17:17.630
Perhaps then there will be no vote
and your predicament will disappear.

17:24.309 --> 17:25.935

That's it.

17:34.620 --> 17:35.848
Word for word.

17:36.088 --> 17:40.218
- And what language did you say?
- Ku.

17:40.459 --> 17:44.691
It's a tribal dialect of Matoban, spoken
throughout the south central African belt.

17:44.930 --> 17:48.957
- Did you see anyone?
- No, but I think that they saw me.

17:49.201 --> 17:52.295
Why didn't you report this last night?

17:53.338 --> 17:56.466
It didn't mean anything to me at the time.

17:57.543 --> 18:00.535
- Rather, I didn't know what it meant.
- But now you do.

18:00.813 --> 18:02.713
I heard something today.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.779
I don't know if I'm permitted.

18:07.052 --> 18:08.917
- It was in a closed...
- You are.

18:09.154 --> 18:13.090
In fact, you're obligated,
as you were last night when you didn't.

18:16.095 --> 18:19.428
I think they were talking
about Edmond Zuwanie.

18:19.665 --> 18:23.624
He's planning to come here
to address the GA.

18:24.803 --> 18:26.794
Can you see her?

18:29.308 --> 18:31.401
Turn on the light.

18:38.484 --> 18:40.816
Call the Secret Service.

18:51.230 --> 18:54.393
Bet you really miss this. Welcome back.

18:54.633 --> 18:58.000
Ma'am? Excuse me.
Please don't touch the Prime Minister.

18:58.237 --> 19:02.230

19:11.583 --> 19:16.145
They're here to protest the appearance
later this week by Edmond Zuwanie.

19:16.388 --> 19:19.221
Not just his political future
but any future for him

19:19.458 --> 19:22.018
hinges on that speech
to the General Assembly.

19:22.261 --> 19:24.661
Dr Zuwanie is accused of genocide,

19:24.897 --> 19:29.231
but he's expected to argue that his actions
were a defensive response to terrorism

19:29.468 --> 19:34.462
and not acts of aggression, as some
Security Council members have charged.

19:34.706 --> 19:37.334
- Secret Service.
- Just a moment, please.

19:37.576 --> 19:40.773
We're with Foreign Dignitary Protection.

19:41.780 --> 19:45.272
- It's a branch of the US government.
- Dot.

19:45.517 --> 19:49.146
This is international territory.
I need you to wait for an escort.

19:49.388 --> 19:51.117
Zuwanie lands at 8.45 hours.

19:51.356 --> 19:54.951
State Department says no meet-and-greet,
no shopping, no Lion King.

19:55.194 --> 19:59.631
He leaves your podium,
his plane has two hours to clear US airspace,

19:59.865 --> 20:01.696
unless the UN cancels the visit

20:01.934 --> 20:05.893
and Tobin and I can get back
to the important work we were doing.

20:06.171 --> 20:10.164
That's up to the GA President.
We just present a threat assessment.

20:10.409 --> 20:13.003
- Why is he coming?
- To make a speech.

20:13.245 --> 20:15.679
To escape the International Criminal Court.

20:15.914 --> 20:20.749
Security Council was debating whether
to bring charges of ethnic cleansing,

20:20.986 --> 20:24.353
so he'll come,
talk about free elections and reform

20:24.590 --> 20:27.354
and pray that that appeases everyone.

20:27.593 --> 20:30.562
So the stakes are high.
He's not going to cancel.

20:32.064 --> 20:34.328
Tell me about the interpreter.

20:37.569 --> 20:40.299
Born here, but lived mostly
in Africa and Europe.

20:40.539 --> 20:42.530
She studied music in Johannesburg

20:42.774 --> 20:46.710
and linguistics at the Sorbonne
and various countries in Europe.

20:46.945 --> 20:48.071
Parents?

20:48.313 --> 20:52.773
British mother, white African father.
Moved here five years ago.

20:53.018 --> 20:55.885
Interview couldn't have taken long.
She's just what they want.

20:56.121 --> 20:59.090
- She is the UN.
- Can she cook?

20:59.291 --> 21:02.954
What else do we know?
Since the initial clearance.

21:03.228 --> 21:04.627
Is she married?

21:04.863 --> 21:08.560
Does she have a child?
Does she belong to any clubs?

21:08.800 --> 21:11.064
Is she registered to vote?

21:12.337 --> 21:14.897
Democrat? Republican?

21:16.041 --> 21:18.202
What religion is she?

21:20.312 --> 21:21.574
Who is she?

We're responsible for visiting heads of state.

21:44.336 --> 21:49.603
- I don't recall seeing you around.
- They hire us for our forgettable faces.

21:53.812 --> 21:56.337
- Is she on guard?
- Yes, ma'am.

21:56.581 --> 22:01.780
Ma'am. Why is it you guys who carry guns
always sound like cowboys?

22:05.157 --> 22:07.785
I don't concentrate on faces in my job.

22:08.026 --> 22:10.119
But you listen to voices.

22:11.229 --> 22:13.993
Do you think you could identify the voice?

22:14.232 --> 22:18.328
Well, I'd say yes, if it were...
It was almost a whisper.

22:19.738 --> 22:22.366
Whispers disguise the quality of a voice.

22:24.076 --> 22:26.306
You, I imagine, study faces.

22:33.218 --> 22:36.984
- You know, I'm not really a dignitary.
- I know.

22:41.393 --> 22:44.851
How'd you happen to be up there after hours?

22:45.097 --> 22:48.362
We had an evacuation.
I'd left some things in the sound booth.

22:48.600 --> 22:52.900
And there just happened to be some fellas
talking about an assassination

22:53.138 --> 22:58.474
in a language that you and eight other people
understand, in a room full of microphones.

22:58.677 --> 23:00.804
Do you think I'm making it up?

23:02.414 --> 23:04.905
Why would I report a threat I didn't hear?

23:05.150 --> 23:07.209
- People do.
- I don't.

23:07.452 --> 23:09.977
- Some people like attention.
- I don't.

23:12.657 --> 23:15.751
- You don't want Zuwanie here.
- I didn't make it up.

23:15.994 --> 23:20.192
- How do you feel about him?
- I don't care for him.

23:20.432 --> 23:23.424
- Wouldn't mind if he were dead?
- If he were gone.

23:23.668 --> 23:25.329
- Same thing.
- No, it isn't.

23:25.570 --> 23:30.439
If I interpreted "gone" as "dead", I'd be fired.
If they were the same, there'd be no UN.

23:30.675 --> 23:33.940
- Your profession is playing with words.
- I don't play with words.

23:34.179 --> 23:35.908
- You're doing it now.
- You are.

23:36.148 --> 23:40.744
If I wanted him dead, I wouldn't have
reported it. It's not what I want.

23:40.986 --> 23:43.045
- That's not why I'm here.
- Here?

23:43.288 --> 23:48.021
Working at the UN, instead of standing
on a road somewhere with a machine-gun.

23:48.260 --> 23:50.751
- You believe in diplomacy?
- I believe in this place.

23:50.996 --> 23:56.127
- I believe in what it tries to accomplish.
- Well, you've had a tough year, lady.

23:56.401 --> 23:58.266
Listen.

24:00.906 --> 24:04.342
I'm scared, and my protector
is someone who doesn't believe me.

24:06.011 --> 24:08.536
You don't look scared.

24:08.780 --> 24:11.271
People handle fear in different ways, Mr Keller.

24:11.516 --> 24:15.748
It turns some people into stand-up comedians.
You don't know me at all.

24:17.556 --> 24:22.755
Maybe I should see about assigning someone
to look after me who's better suited to the job.

24:22.994 --> 24:24.985
I don't look after you,

24:25.230 --> 24:30.099
I look after the man who's been
threatened, if there was a threat.

24:30.335 --> 24:34.135
My job, as it concerns you,
is to investigate you.

24:35.440 --> 24:38.773
So you're not here to offer me
any protection whatsoever?

24:39.010 --> 24:41.137
No, ma'am.

24:47.686 --> 24:49.711
And we were getting along so well.

24:49.955 --> 24:53.083
- So what do you think?
- She's a liar.

25:05.604 --> 25:09.938
Agent Keller? Morning.
Special Agent Lewis, FBI. This is Agent King.

25:12.077 --> 25:13.476
We're on loan.

25:13.712 --> 25:17.614
So they have to be returned
in the same condition, or no refund.

25:17.849 --> 25:20.477
- Keller.
- Woods.

25:25.891 --> 25:29.952
- Are you sure you're ready to come back?
- I'm better working.

25:31.930 --> 25:35.024
- We got a credible threat?
- We should assume so.

25:35.267 --> 25:38.327
As popular as we are in the rest of the world,

25:38.570 --> 25:42.472
the last thing we need is to have
a foreign leader get popped here,

25:42.707 --> 25:45.676
particularly a guy like this that we don't like.

25:45.911 --> 25:48.744
So State wants you to know, NSA, CIA, FBI,

25:49.014 --> 25:54.543
whatever you need to keep this maniac's
heart beating till he gets out, it's yours.

26:02.961 --> 26:05.657
- [phone rings]
- Woods.

26:05.897 --> 26:08.263
[caller indistinct]

26:08.500 --> 26:11.731
[Dot] Zuwanie's head of security's arrived.
He wants a meeting right away.

26:11.970 --> 26:14.871
[Tobin] He'll have to wait
till we get back from Washington.

26:15.106 --> 26:19.236
- He's white. He was a Dutch mercenary.
- He'll still have to wait.

26:19.477 --> 26:22.537
[Jon] It's hard to remember
that Zuwanie was once a good man.

26:22.781 --> 26:24.874
That's not unusual for these guys.

26:25.116 --> 26:29.576
They begin as liberators. 20 minutes later,
they're as corrupt as the tyrants they topple.

26:29.821 --> 26:34.053
He liberated the country from one of
the most corrupt governments on earth,

26:34.292 --> 26:40.060
gave the people hope, and was a hero.
They need another name for what he is now.

26:40.298 --> 26:43.290
- Man likes his gun.
- He'll have it with him.

26:43.568 --> 26:45.866
He knows he won't be scanned.

26:46.104 --> 26:47.264
Who are his enemies?

26:47.505 --> 26:52.374
Aside from the thousands of victims' relatives?
These two.

26:54.012 --> 26:56.037
Both his opponents, both want his job.

26:56.281 --> 26:58.306
On the right, Ajene Xola.

26:59.117 --> 27:03.110
Son of a doctor, Paris-educated,
pacifist to begin with.

27:03.355 --> 27:06.085
- Aren't they all?
- He managed longer than most.

27:06.324 --> 27:09.885
- And the other?
- He has two names, he's always in the Post.

27:10.128 --> 27:13.097
One name, twice. Kuman-Kuman.

27:13.331 --> 27:17.427
He's been yelling about Zuwanie being
a madman and the UN not doing enough.

27:18.403 --> 27:19.961
He's in exile in Brooklyn.

27:20.205 --> 27:23.641
A socialist and a capitalist,
both gaining strength with the people,

27:23.875 --> 27:26.435
both with the motivation to see Zuwanie gone.

27:28.046 --> 27:30.378
- Gone?
- Dead.

27:30.615 --> 27:33.243
But not just dead.

27:33.485 --> 27:37.819
Dead in front of the delegates of 191 countries
and every news service with a camera.

27:38.056 --> 27:41.287
- In front of the world.
- Nobody needs to be that dead.

27:42.227 --> 27:46.561
In my opinion,
we're wasting tax dollars staying late.

27:46.798 --> 27:48.595
It's a con.

27:52.203 --> 27:55.229
- This is the interpreter?
- I need everything CIA has on her.

27:55.473 --> 27:57.498
[phone ringing]

28:08.119 --> 28:11.282
[answer machine. male French voice]

28:11.556 --> 28:13.524
[speaks French]

28:33.011 --> 28:35.605
[Lud] So what do we make of this interpreter?

28:35.847 --> 28:40.250
Is she making it up? Is she imagining things?

28:40.452 --> 28:41.942
I'm looking for Mr Lud.

28:42.187 --> 28:45.645
- Is she pretty?
- I brought you a copy of her UN file.

28:45.890 --> 28:48.586
Dr Zuwanie won't cancel his speech,
you know.

28:48.827 --> 28:52.854
That's up to the GA President,
but you might want to think about it.

28:53.098 --> 28:56.693
- Ms Broome has a Matoban passport.
- Excuse me?

28:56.935 --> 29:00.632
She was born here, she was raised there,
so she has dual citizenship.

29:00.872 --> 29:03.602
Are you serious?

29:05.210 --> 29:07.405
Black or white?

29:07.679 --> 29:09.510
No, thank you.

29:09.748 --> 29:14.014
- Is she black or white?
- White.

29:14.986 --> 29:18.854
- [Lud] Did you give her a polygraph test?
- [Tobin] Not yet, no.

29:19.090 --> 29:21.320
Well, shouldn't you?

29:46.151 --> 29:47.413
[cell phone]

29:49.120 --> 29:51.054
Hi, Ma.

29:52.290 --> 29:56.556
Back off, you're too close. Way too close.
What are you, on a date?

31:23.915 --> 31:28.443
Hey, you got the Kellers. We're out
having a good time, so leave a message.

31:29.954 --> 31:31.979
[female voice] Hey, you there?

31:33.725 --> 31:35.249
Maybe I made a mistake.

31:36.361 --> 31:38.829
Are you there?

31:39.063 --> 31:41.054
Shit.

31:41.332 --> 31:45.826
I told him I want to come back.
He's dropping me off at the airport now,

31:46.070 --> 31:50.666
and I was wondering...
Anyway, you don't have to meet me.

31:53.378 --> 31:55.642
Unless you want to.

31:56.648 --> 31:58.878
I hope you haven't changed the locks.

32:02.654 --> 32:06.750
[# Lyle Lovett: If I Had a Boat]

32:08.426 --> 32:13.022
# If I were Roy Rogers
I'd sure enough be single...

32:15.466 --> 32:20.665
# lt'd just be me and Trigger
We'd go riding through them movies #

32:50.435 --> 32:53.199
They're ready for you.

32:53.438 --> 32:55.303
I'll be right there.

33:05.850 --> 33:09.183
- I'll be right there.
- OK.

33:11.556 --> 33:13.217
Ms Broome.

33:15.259 --> 33:18.854
- Can I get you anything?
- How about a hood?

33:19.097 --> 33:22.624
- I want to split that.
- When do I know the results?

33:22.867 --> 33:26.667
Right away.
You know when you're lying, don't you?

33:35.747 --> 33:38.511
Look straight ahead, feet flat on the floor.

33:38.750 --> 33:41.412
Is your name Silvia Broome?

33:42.754 --> 33:43.880
Miss Broome?

33:44.122 --> 33:47.216
I found out something from our domestic Intel.

33:47.492 --> 33:50.222
All this may have begun with a tragic accident.

33:50.495 --> 33:53.692
- What do you mean?
- Her parents farmed in the mountains.

33:53.931 --> 33:56.866
This area became infested
with rebels in the '80s

33:57.101 --> 33:59.695
and Dr Zuwanie was forced to mine the roads.

33:59.937 --> 34:04.374
Her parents were bringing her younger sister
back from school and hit a mine.

34:04.575 --> 34:07.203
- And they were killed?
- All of them.

34:09.047 --> 34:12.312
- How old was she?
- 12, 13.

34:16.020 --> 34:21.458
Something like that, even years later,
could incite all kinds of ideas.

34:24.762 --> 34:29.062
She has every reason
to want Dr Zuwanie tried at the ICC.

34:33.938 --> 34:36.168
I'll be right back.

34:38.543 --> 34:42.946
- Oh, no. Come on.
- OK, the control questions show stress,

34:43.181 --> 34:47.618
and the key questions show stress
as well as the baseline questions.

34:47.851 --> 34:49.717
We should just read her palm.

34:52.322 --> 34:56.089
- How did I do?
- Je ne sais pas.

34:57.328 --> 35:00.627
Nils Lud. Dr Zuwanie's head of security.

35:03.301 --> 35:08.398
I thought since you were in a
question-answering mood, I might ask a few.

35:09.474 --> 35:13.308
Might I ask where you stand now
politically, Miss Broome?

35:13.578 --> 35:19.414
I'm for peace and quiet, Mr Lud.
It's why I came to the UN. Quiet diplomacy.

35:19.650 --> 35:22.744
With respect, you only interpret.

35:23.855 --> 35:27.655
Countries have gone to war
after misinterpreting one another.

35:27.892 --> 35:31.555
I would say she's clearly under stress,
but not necessarily lying.

35:33.998 --> 35:35.124
Congratulations.

35:35.366 --> 35:40.497
- I'm told what you heard was a whisper.
- Yes.

35:40.738 --> 35:44.902
Is it possible you could identify it
if you ever heard it again?

35:46.410 --> 35:48.503
It might be.

35:48.746 --> 35:51.476
Tell me, do you have a brother?

35:56.053 --> 36:00.922
I hope it's all right. I took this opportunity
to ask Miss Broome a few questions.

36:02.026 --> 36:05.962
You're free to go.
Agent Scott will drive you back to the UN.

36:09.367 --> 36:12.962
Would you drive Ms Broome
back to the UN, please? Thank you.

36:13.204 --> 36:17.265
- Does this mean the test was...?
- The test was inconclusive.

36:17.508 --> 36:21.808
But I'd rather make the mistake
of believing her than the bigger one of not.

36:22.046 --> 36:27.985
Next time you want to question an
American citizen here, you ask permission.

36:30.054 --> 36:32.386
- Silvia.
- Don't worry, I'm not leaving any...

36:32.657 --> 36:37.321
Did you do something naughty?
A couple of FBls were asking me about you.

36:38.396 --> 36:43.333
If you often work later than everybody,
or bring things in after hours. Like that.

36:44.769 --> 36:50.036
- What'd you tell them?
- I said, from a sound engineer's point of view,

36:50.274 --> 36:51.400
you're perfect.

36:51.709 --> 36:54.143
I need somebody on the guy with two names.

36:54.378 --> 36:57.370
- Mo.
- It's one name twice. Kuman-Kuman.

36:57.648 --> 36:59.775
You volunteering, or just correcting me?

37:00.017 --> 37:02.383
- I'm from Brooklyn.
- You got him. You and...?

37:02.653 --> 37:07.090
- I was on him when he first came here.
- OK, you got him again.

37:07.325 --> 37:09.589
I thought she had perfect pitch.

37:09.827 --> 37:12.421
She says whispers
don't have a recognisable pitch.

37:12.697 --> 37:15.427
NSA agrees. They say it's very difficult.

37:15.700 --> 37:18.100
- They don't know that.
- They say they do.

37:18.336 --> 37:22.033
No, not NSA. Whoever she heard.

37:23.107 --> 37:25.940
Why not let them keep thinking she can ID it?

37:27.311 --> 37:31.611
- What are you asking me to do, Jay?
- I don't want her to be harmed.

37:31.849 --> 37:37.151
In fact, get a place, keep an eye on her.
We got three days. She's your only link.

37:37.388 --> 37:39.253
Are we using her as bait?

37:42.593 --> 37:43.992
Just make the calls.

37:44.228 --> 37:48.187
I'm sending you an attachment.
Can you print front and back?

37:49.233 --> 37:53.067
I've asked INS for a list of arrivals
in the last six months.

37:53.304 --> 37:57.240
Zimbabwe, Botswana, Matobo.
I'll do voice samples on everyone.

37:57.475 --> 38:02.071
So when she hears the voice again,
she can identify it.

38:02.313 --> 38:06.249
- She said it was a whisper.
- Well, now she thinks she can do it.

38:07.718 --> 38:11.176
- Photo there yet?
- It's printing. Let me put you on speaker.

38:15.326 --> 38:19.695
That's an anti-Zuwanie rally.
The man speaking is Ajene Xola.

38:21.032 --> 38:24.024
Look at the crowd.

38:25.536 --> 38:26.935
Look closely.

39:08.012 --> 39:09.809
Any leads?

39:12.583 --> 39:15.143
Maybe one.

39:15.386 --> 39:17.513
Come on down to Mexico.

39:28.532 --> 39:30.056
Is that you?

39:35.940 --> 39:37.567
Tell me what someone like you

39:37.842 --> 39:41.334
who uses the word "diplomacy"
like she's chastising me

39:41.579 --> 39:43.410
is doing at a rebel rally?

39:43.647 --> 39:47.242
- A peace rally.
- I don't want to do this again.

39:47.485 --> 39:51.421
That's exactly what it is.
What I'm doing is listening.

39:51.655 --> 39:53.350
After that. After you listen.

39:53.591 --> 39:57.425
- You're asking the wrong question.
- It's one you don't want to answer.

39:57.661 --> 40:02.223
Why would somebody type the names
of everyone in this on the back?

40:02.466 --> 40:05.401
This is a death list.

40:07.138 --> 40:12.303
The question you should be asking is,
"Who gave me this and why?"

40:16.447 --> 40:19.439
- What are you not saying?
- What are you accusing me of?

40:19.683 --> 40:23.642
How do you feel about Zuwanie,
never mind "I don't care for him"?

40:23.888 --> 40:25.981
I feel disappointment.

40:27.291 --> 40:29.851
That's a lover's word.

40:32.096 --> 40:34.189
What about rage?

40:35.499 --> 40:38.832
Of all the people I've looked into
since this thing started,

40:39.069 --> 40:43.301
the one with the darkest
Zuwanie history is you.

40:45.309 --> 40:48.710
- It was his land-mines that killed your...
- Sh!

40:49.814 --> 40:52.374
We don't name the dead.

40:55.653 --> 40:58.121
Everyone who loses somebody
wants revenge,

40:58.355 --> 41:01.051
on God if they can't find anyone else.

41:03.260 --> 41:04.750
But in Africa,

41:06.130 --> 41:12.069
in Matobo, the Ku believe that
the only way to end grief is to save a life.

41:14.638 --> 41:17.129
If someone is murdered,

41:17.374 --> 41:22.573
a year of mourning ends with a ritual
that we call the Drowning Man Trial.

41:23.814 --> 41:28.615
There's an all-night party beside a river.
At dawn, the killer is put in a boat.

41:28.853 --> 41:34.314
He's taken out on the water and he's
dropped. He's bound so that he can't swim.

41:34.558 --> 41:38.358
The family of the dead then has to choose.
They can let him drown,

41:38.596 --> 41:40.564
or they can save him.

41:43.000 --> 41:47.494
The Ku believe that if the family
lets the killer drown,

41:47.738 --> 41:52.004
they'll have justice
but spend the rest of their lives in mourning.

41:54.044 --> 41:58.981
But if they save him,
if they admit that life isn't always just...

42:01.719 --> 42:04.586
...that very act can take away their sorrow.

42:07.958 --> 42:10.791
Vengeance is a lazy form of grief.

42:23.641 --> 42:25.871
Why do you look away?

42:28.412 --> 42:32.405
There are things I don't like to talk about
and you call it lying.

42:33.417 --> 42:35.715
But not when you do it.

42:37.755 --> 42:40.280
I'm not the one under investigation.

42:47.431 --> 42:49.456
That was a long time ago.

43:30.374 --> 43:31.966
- FBI.
- Intel.

43:32.209 --> 43:34.575
- TTF.
- Sniper team.

43:34.812 --> 43:36.905
Secret Service.

43:37.147 --> 43:41.083
This is Nils Lud,
head of Dr Zuwanie's security.

43:41.318 --> 43:42.945
Shall we take a walk?

43:43.187 --> 43:48.022
[she plays haunting melodic tune]

43:55.899 --> 44:00.063
- How close can a vehicle get over here?
- Not close enough.

44:00.304 --> 44:04.240
- No garage under the GA.
- Dogs sweep every night. It's not a bomb.

44:06.043 --> 44:09.535
- It has to be a rifle.
- From where?

44:10.881 --> 44:12.644
How does he get a rifle in?

44:20.557 --> 44:23.117
- Could be from up close.
- Who gets that close?

44:23.360 --> 44:25.954
One of Zuwanie's bodyguards?

44:26.196 --> 44:31.498
That's a good thought, but we'd much prefer
to kill him at home without you watching.

44:31.735 --> 44:33.703
It's already here.

44:36.173 --> 44:38.937
If these guys know their stuff,
the weapon is here.

44:52.222 --> 44:54.156
[phone rings]

45:00.030 --> 45:01.827
Hello?

45:02.066 --> 45:05.763
- [line crackles - no voice]
- Hello, Philippe? Hello?

45:09.807 --> 45:11.798
[she screams]

45:26.957 --> 45:30.791
No prints on the door
and negative for latex dust.

45:31.028 --> 45:33.292
- Nothing on the door?
- No.

45:35.599 --> 45:38.067
- No forced entry.
- Did Doug not see him?

45:38.302 --> 45:41.738
No, he missed it.
Some lady called 911, saw the guy.

45:41.972 --> 45:44.873
Go easy on him, OK? He feels terrible.

45:46.777 --> 45:52.181
On the roof. He must have gone over the roof
to get to the next building.

45:52.382 --> 45:56.751
- I couldn't see the fire escape.
- Give me that.

45:57.855 --> 46:00.255
You mean you screwed up.

46:01.525 --> 46:05.052
- I mean I screwed up.
- So did I.

46:06.964 --> 46:09.899
I need Polaroids of that, inside and out.

46:12.870 --> 46:15.338
- You OK?
- Great.

46:15.572 --> 46:18.564
- Who else has a key to this apartment?
- No one.

46:18.809 --> 46:21.835
- You don't keep a spare outside somewhere?
- No.

46:22.079 --> 46:24.047
- No one else has a key...
- Nobody.

46:24.281 --> 46:26.841
- The door wasn't forced.
- They can't pick locks?

46:27.084 --> 46:30.417
They can, we can tell. They didn't.

46:30.654 --> 46:32.747
- Where do you keep your key?
- My purse.

46:32.990 --> 46:35.982
- It hasn't been out of your sight all day?
- No.

46:40.197 --> 46:42.495
Yes.

46:42.733 --> 46:45.167
In my locker.

46:45.402 --> 46:50.965
Dot. Wake up Rory, have him dust her locker
and those beside it before morning.

46:52.075 --> 46:57.513
So you were just having a quiet evening,
some gentleman in a mask waves to you.

46:57.714 --> 47:00.274
That's about it, yeah.

47:00.517 --> 47:02.542
[something falls]

47:05.823 --> 47:06.847
Dot?

47:08.859 --> 47:12.056
Is there anything special about this mask?

47:12.296 --> 47:16.130
I'll be honest with you.
I don't know how honest I can be with you.

47:19.002 --> 47:21.402
My brother gave it to me.

47:23.207 --> 47:26.233
I still have a brother there
who I'm close to. Simon.

47:27.477 --> 47:33.416
We've... lost touch for a while,
but... we're close.

47:33.650 --> 47:39.589
Is he standing on the road somewhere with
a machine-gun, or is he into diplomacy, too?

47:39.823 --> 47:41.757
He's more into lists.

47:43.594 --> 47:47.155
Farm kids will do anything
to amuse themselves. Mostly you fight.

47:48.699 --> 47:51.759
I read. My brother kept lists.

47:52.002 --> 47:54.232
Weird lists in ratty notebooks.

47:54.471 --> 47:57.372
Times and dates that Mum used the F-word,

47:57.608 --> 48:01.374
countries with advantageous
male to female ratios,

48:01.612 --> 48:04.046
odd animal facts.

48:04.281 --> 48:07.580
Did you know the leading cause of death
for beavers is falling trees?

48:07.818 --> 48:11.185
- Yes.
- You did not.

48:13.957 --> 48:16.448
He had a notebook for words that he liked.

48:16.693 --> 48:20.254
Hypotenuse, doodad, bodacious.

48:21.698 --> 48:24.496
Could he be involved in this?

48:30.440 --> 48:33.273
We're stuck, aren't we? You and I?

48:34.411 --> 48:37.039
We're kepéla.

48:37.281 --> 48:40.011
It means standing on
opposite sides of the river.

48:44.821 --> 48:47.517
Give me a reason to get to the other side.

49:06.843 --> 49:09.107
[speaking Ku]

49:19.856 --> 49:22.051
[muffled cries]

49:31.835 --> 49:33.860
Just wait a second.

49:42.846 --> 49:44.780
OK.

49:52.990 --> 49:57.950
There's a blue and white outside.
NYPD'll keep an eye on you until morning.

49:59.663 --> 50:01.961
And then?

50:04.234 --> 50:06.930
We'll figure something out.

50:07.170 --> 50:08.330
Thank you.

50:26.690 --> 50:29.921
My wife was killed two weeks ago.

50:33.764 --> 50:36.631
She... she'd left me.

50:40.203 --> 50:44.071
She'd left me before,
but she'd always come back.

50:44.307 --> 50:46.775
She was going to come back this time.

50:47.010 --> 50:49.001
She said.

50:55.719 --> 50:57.516
She was a dancer.

51:01.158 --> 51:03.217
The guy was a dancer, too.

51:04.895 --> 51:05.953
Eddie.

51:08.165 --> 51:10.929
Great dancer.

51:11.168 --> 51:13.136
Lousy driver.

51:14.938 --> 51:17.668
The only way he knew how to stop a car

51:17.908 --> 51:21.400
was to slam it
into a bridge abutment in Santa Fe.

51:24.114 --> 51:27.208
So there was no taking her back this time.

51:30.687 --> 51:36.626
The thing is, if he had lived,
and I had a choice...

51:39.996 --> 51:42.931
...I think I would have let him drown.

51:46.636 --> 51:50.367
I might have even
held his head under the water.

51:56.880 --> 51:59.371
Not a very Ku thing to do.

52:08.391 --> 52:12.794
If you need anything, you can call the precinct
or just go downstairs.

52:21.872 --> 52:23.703
This is my cell number.

52:27.110 --> 52:29.476
It's the same card.

52:34.017 --> 52:36.110
Goodnight.

52:39.189 --> 52:40.781
Lock this.

52:42.726 --> 52:46.787
It's a remodel. Owner's in the middle
of a divorce. We got lucky.

52:51.401 --> 52:54.962
We got a clear view.
Front door's 50 seconds away.

52:55.205 --> 52:58.368
- I'll do first shift.
- Are Lewis and Clark babysitting Kuman?

52:58.642 --> 53:01.042
Lewis and King. He'll be in bed soon.

53:01.278 --> 53:04.406
FBI's right.
Guy does the same routine every day.

53:06.316 --> 53:09.945
Call me if she gets
another trick-or-treater. I'm off.

53:11.721 --> 53:13.848
Sweet dreams, partner.

53:15.725 --> 53:17.090
[French being spoken]

53:17.327 --> 53:20.490
[Silvia translates]... the belief
that the individual needs of people

53:20.730 --> 53:24.757
are paramount to its purpose,
and with it goes the assumption

53:25.001 --> 53:29.870
that human rights are fundamental
to human prosperity and development.

53:31.007 --> 53:35.171
They cannot be separated.
They can only be said to exist...

53:35.412 --> 53:38.506
You got one shot. You sever the brain stem,
creating paralysis,

53:38.748 --> 53:43.481
you drop the perpetrator without reflex action.
He can't activate a detonator. Thank you.

53:45.922 --> 53:51.224
If you have to issue a verbal warning,
you get very close before you do so.

53:51.461 --> 53:54.259
No. There won't be time for a second one.

53:54.497 --> 53:57.557
Whatever the weapon is,
consider this a suicide bomber.

53:57.801 --> 53:59.962
There's no profile for a suicide bomber.

54:00.203 --> 54:04.833
This could be nine or 90, male or female,
a PhD or a dropout.

54:05.075 --> 54:08.533
All they have in common
is they are not afraid to die.

54:08.778 --> 54:13.909
So this is either a fanatic for a cause
or someone who has nothing to live for.

54:14.150 --> 54:18.484
We'll run two teams. DDO calls the decoy exit
30 seconds before the intersection.

54:18.722 --> 54:24.627
NYPD snipers from these two buildings here,
our guys sniper the bridge.

54:24.828 --> 54:28.355
Her locker was clean.
The others were covered with prints.

54:28.598 --> 54:32.364
Someone wiped hers. We're looking
at a janitor or a maintenance worker.

54:32.602 --> 54:34.399
Or another interpreter.

54:48.184 --> 54:51.153
So when do we do this voice line-up?

54:51.388 --> 54:53.982
We're not doing that any more.

54:54.224 --> 54:57.660
- She says she can't.
- Can't what?

54:57.894 --> 55:02.763
ID the voice. She thought she could, now
she thinks she can't. She's sure she can't.

55:02.999 --> 55:08.164
She can't because she can't, or because
she never heard anything to start with?

55:08.405 --> 55:12.501
[conversation in Portuguese]

55:13.743 --> 55:17.679
- He says he wasn't here... I think.
- Not according to this.

55:19.082 --> 55:23.542
[he speaks Portuguese, she speaks French]

55:24.120 --> 55:27.647
- He traded shifts with someone. Com quem?
- Jamal.

55:28.692 --> 55:31.627
Jad Jamal. He's in Crown Heights.

55:40.637 --> 55:42.662
[knocking]

55:48.211 --> 55:51.339
Afternoon. Secret Service.
Need to talk to Jad Jamal.

55:56.619 --> 56:00.555
- Does this guy live here?
- No, no here. With lady.

56:00.790 --> 56:04.157
You got lady's number?

56:04.394 --> 56:06.692
Does he have a cell phone?

56:06.930 --> 56:11.890
OK, we'll be back. If he shows up before that,
have him give us a call.

56:12.135 --> 56:16.333
[chanting and singing]

56:20.076 --> 56:22.306
[click of camera]

56:29.119 --> 56:31.144
[phone]

56:33.623 --> 56:36.683
- Hello?
- Silvia, c'est moi. Philippe.

56:37.761 --> 56:38.819
Philippe.

56:39.562 --> 56:42.827
- Going out.
- I got her.

56:52.075 --> 56:54.009
- Shit.
- Shit.

57:24.674 --> 57:27.234
Oh, come on.

57:43.259 --> 57:45.090
Philippe.

57:46.796 --> 57:51.130
[she speaks French]

57:58.141 --> 58:00.507
- What is it?
- I've done a terrible thing.

58:00.743 --> 58:02.734
- It is Simon.
- No, listen.

58:02.979 --> 58:07.575
Someone contacted me.
One of Kuman's people...

58:07.817 --> 58:12.550
I thought it was one of his people...
to arrange a meeting with Xola.

58:12.789 --> 58:17.089
They said it was time to admit that
only together could they stop Zuwanie.

58:17.327 --> 58:19.557
- What happened?
- So I arrange it.

58:20.663 --> 58:23.325
But it was a trap.

58:26.970 --> 58:28.437
Xola's dead.

58:35.345 --> 58:37.745
I knew it.

58:37.981 --> 58:39.915
I knew he was dead.

58:43.319 --> 58:45.913
Was my brother there?

58:48.424 --> 58:50.949
No, Simon wasn't there. Only Xola.

58:53.196 --> 58:56.529
I stayed in the car. No one came back out.

58:57.667 --> 59:01.228
- Where is he? Where's my brother?
- I don't know.

59:02.639 --> 59:05.938
- You think Kuman has him?
- I don't know what to think.

59:06.175 --> 59:11.670
Everything is chaos. It's all gone to hell.
How did it get to be like this?

59:11.915 --> 59:16.409
You see what I did? I took Xola right to them.

59:17.520 --> 59:20.921
- You didn't know.
- Forgive me.

59:23.326 --> 59:27.695
- I was only trying to help.
- There's nothing to forgive.

59:29.699 --> 59:30.825
Yes, there is.

59:31.067 --> 59:33.160
- I have to go.
- Philippe.

59:36.573 --> 59:37.904
[click of camera]

59:44.414 --> 59:49.852
You cannot do that. How the hell do I
protect you if I don't know where you are?

59:50.086 --> 59:53.351
You emphatically told me that you weren't.

59:53.590 --> 59:59.153
That was before you had a man in a mask
on your fire escape.

01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:04.226
I've had a 24-hour shift of agents
across the street.

01:00:06.402 --> 01:00:09.200
Who was that in the park?

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:13.636
- It's personal.
- We're past that. What's his name?

01:00:13.876 --> 01:00:15.002
It's not your business.

01:00:15.244 --> 01:00:18.805
Is he the one you e-mailed
before reporting the threat?

01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:25.644
"Where are you?
I'm worried about you. Write me."

01:00:25.888 --> 01:00:28.982
"Please. I need to know you're OK"?

01:00:30.793 --> 01:00:33.057
Worried why? Because he's involved?

01:00:34.297 --> 01:00:39.098
Is that him, here, now, in my country,
making threats? That is my business.

01:00:39.335 --> 01:00:42.463
You're wrong. It's got nothing to do with you.

01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:26.707
[Simon's voice] I'll take care of you.

01:01:38.961 --> 01:01:43.728
- I'm going to Starbucks. Want anything?
- Just what I need, another night without sleep.

01:01:43.966 --> 01:01:46.457
I'm good. Thanks.

01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:51.173
What's up with Common Kuman?

01:01:51.407 --> 01:01:53.932
- Brushing his teeth.
- I gotta talk to him.

01:01:54.177 --> 01:01:58.477
Café Atlantic, noon to two, then
the Nava Club for a steam and massage.

01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:02.151
- Coffee?
- No, I'm good, thanks.

01:02:06.022 --> 01:02:09.287
She can't sleep either. Just turned the TV on.

01:02:10.393 --> 01:02:12.418
Probably PBS.

01:02:13.930 --> 01:02:16.922
- Where you going?
- You're here with your bag.

01:02:17.166 --> 01:02:20.101
I can go home and get a good night's sleep.

01:02:22.138 --> 01:02:24.129
Unless you want me to stay.

01:02:26.509 --> 01:02:27.976
No. Thanks.

01:02:28.211 --> 01:02:31.647
- Thanks.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

01:02:31.881 --> 01:02:36.818
United Nations, New York. Protests
erupted here following an announcement

01:02:37.053 --> 01:02:41.490
that President Edmond Zuwanie
will address the General Assembly Friday.

01:02:41.724 --> 01:02:45.717
The exiled leader Kuman-Kuman
rallied today's protesters.

01:02:45.962 --> 01:02:48.897
He would be more convincing
if he were assassinated.

01:02:49.165 --> 01:02:50.689
He doesn't even have to die.

01:02:50.933 --> 01:02:53.697
An almost-assassinated leader
gets so much credibility,

01:02:53.936 --> 01:02:57.463
he can do anything he wants...
and stick around to enjoy it.

01:02:57.707 --> 01:03:02.371
Security is on heightened alert
in response to anonymous threats...

01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:05.080
[cell phone]

01:03:05.314 --> 01:03:08.181
- Keller.
- [Silvia] I'm sorry.

01:03:09.418 --> 01:03:12.114
I really didn't know you were watching me...

01:03:14.090 --> 01:03:17.321
...or I wouldn't have just... left like that.

01:03:19.262 --> 01:03:23.221
- You want to tell me what happened?
- I had to meet someone.

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:28.700
- Philippe Broullet.
- If you knew, why did you ask?

01:03:28.938 --> 01:03:32.897
I know his name, I know he's
a photographer for a French magazine.

01:03:33.142 --> 01:03:37.101
- He needed to talk to me.
- Now you're watching TV, unable to sleep.

01:03:37.346 --> 01:03:39.940
- What did he say?
- How do you know I'm...?

01:03:40.216 --> 01:03:42.377
Are you over there?

01:03:48.591 --> 01:03:50.388
Jesus.

01:03:55.798 --> 01:03:58.790
He told me we lost a friend.

01:03:59.035 --> 01:04:03.472
He lost a friend.
I... lost someone I loved once.

01:04:04.774 --> 01:04:07.470
It was a long time ago.

01:04:10.813 --> 01:04:12.542
You can't sleep either.

01:04:13.816 --> 01:04:15.875
I don't know why I'm calling you.

01:04:16.118 --> 01:04:20.054
- What do you do when you can't sleep?
- I stay awake.

01:04:25.962 --> 01:04:28.726
You don't name the dead, you said. Why?

01:04:30.199 --> 01:04:32.292
What... what happens?

01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:37.935
You move past them. You leave them behind.

01:04:39.008 --> 01:04:42.967
You can do that,
but you have to be ready to let them go.

01:04:43.212 --> 01:04:44.941
To move on.

01:04:46.649 --> 01:04:49.846
You've been going through hell.

01:04:50.086 --> 01:04:51.644
Keeping busy.

01:04:53.823 --> 01:04:57.953
You, too, I think. I don't know all of it, but...

01:05:07.036 --> 01:05:10.164
Are you going to be there until morning?

01:05:10.406 --> 01:05:12.465
It almost is morning.

01:05:13.576 --> 01:05:15.942
Yeah, I'll be here.

01:05:17.346 --> 01:05:21.146
Is it OK if I just try to fall asleep
over the phone?

01:05:26.188 --> 01:05:29.123
That's fine.

01:05:48.711 --> 01:05:50.303
Goodnight.

01:06:02.158 --> 01:06:03.989
She's coming your way.

01:06:06.162 --> 01:06:10.758
Oh, no. No scooter, please.
Come on, no scooter.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.366
Yes. Thank you, God.

01:06:24.447 --> 01:06:27.610
You might as well drive me.
We're going to Brooklyn.

01:06:29.452 --> 01:06:31.511
Corner of Bergen and Nostrand.

01:06:31.754 --> 01:06:36.191
Jad Jamal. Worked the interpreters' lounge
the day the mask showed up.

01:06:36.425 --> 01:06:39.883
- Bring him to me.
- Can't. He didn't show up for work.

01:06:40.129 --> 01:06:42.097
- Sit on his apartment.
- Doug's there.

01:06:42.331 --> 01:06:44.629
Hey. Got the INS files.

01:06:55.611 --> 01:07:00.412
- This isn't the way it's supposed to be done.
- You can let me off up here.

01:07:19.635 --> 01:07:23.002
She's at the corner of Bergen
and Nostrand in Brooklyn.

01:07:23.239 --> 01:07:26.470
- She's where?
- My guy's on the move.

01:07:28.978 --> 01:07:31.105
She's here, whether I brought her or not.

01:07:31.347 --> 01:07:33.815
- Go back. What's she doing?
- Waiting for something.

01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:36.450
- Holy shit.
- What?

01:07:36.685 --> 01:07:38.949
The janitor. Jad Jamal.

01:07:39.188 --> 01:07:42.783
- That's not him.
- I know. That's his room-mate.

01:07:54.103 --> 01:07:56.037
Jamal's room-mate just left the building.

01:07:56.272 --> 01:07:58.934
His name is Gamba. Jean Gamba.

01:07:59.175 --> 01:08:02.542
- Should I stay here?
- No, you stick with the room-mate.

01:08:02.778 --> 01:08:05.713
- Are we working on a warrant?
- Lewis is.

01:08:05.981 --> 01:08:08.211
- How are you?
- I got something for you.

01:08:08.484 --> 01:08:11.214
OK, bless you.

01:08:47.923 --> 01:08:49.185
Tobin?

01:08:58.901 --> 01:09:01.734
- What's up?
- I don't know, but it don't feel good.

01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:07.366
- What are they doing?
- Just standing there.

01:09:14.483 --> 01:09:16.508
We're getting on the el.

01:09:22.625 --> 01:09:26.220
[speaks Ku]

01:09:29.698 --> 01:09:32.326
- Shit.
- She just got on the bus with Kuman.

01:09:33.868 --> 01:09:36.029
[Tobin] What the hell is she doing?

01:09:47.950 --> 01:09:50.077
Did I hear home?

01:09:51.787 --> 01:09:55.484
- Or was I wrong, then?
- No, you're right. I'm Matoban.

01:09:55.724 --> 01:09:58.124
And a fair Matoban, in fact.

01:10:00.796 --> 01:10:02.957
[Tobin] King, you stay with that bus.

01:10:06.502 --> 01:10:08.993
Do you know who I am?

01:10:09.238 --> 01:10:10.262
Yes.

01:10:12.107 --> 01:10:15.668
You're a killer.
You ordered the murder of Ajene Xola.

01:10:23.852 --> 01:10:27.754
You got a red light in that car?
Why don't you use it?

01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:32.290
- Who told you this nonsense?
- Where's my brother?

01:10:32.528 --> 01:10:35.361
Your brother? I don't even know who you are.

01:10:36.498 --> 01:10:40.832
You are on the wrong bus, so to speak,
to be so reckless.

01:10:49.078 --> 01:10:52.639
Your people arranged a meeting
through Philippe Broullet.

01:10:52.881 --> 01:10:56.510
- You know him.
- I don't... and I didn't.

01:10:56.752 --> 01:11:01.519
But the fact is, somebody wants you
to believe that I killed Ajene Xola.

01:11:02.658 --> 01:11:07.618
- I don't believe you.
- [Kuman-Kuman] But you should believe me.

01:11:07.863 --> 01:11:11.026
- Why?
- Because I would form a coalition with Xola.

01:11:11.967 --> 01:11:15.198
Neither of us have made
enough progress alone.

01:11:15.437 --> 01:11:18.565
He has the working people.
I have the finances.

01:11:18.807 --> 01:11:24.336
If he is dead, it is a loss
for all of us. Me especially.

01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:26.810
[Doug] We're getting off.

01:11:30.686 --> 01:11:32.813
I got the back room.

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:39.819
Jesus.

01:11:41.630 --> 01:11:43.154
Clear the other room.

01:11:55.811 --> 01:11:57.676
OK.

01:11:57.913 --> 01:12:00.575
- Closet.
- Yeah. I got the bed.

01:12:14.763 --> 01:12:17.596
[Dot] Ho! Keller?

01:12:21.003 --> 01:12:23.733
- We got a dead body in the closet.
- Jamal?

01:12:23.972 --> 01:12:28.568
Yeah. I'll call it in.
God, how can you see in here?

01:12:28.811 --> 01:12:30.574
Wait. Wait.

01:12:35.117 --> 01:12:37.608
Why the lanterns?

01:12:41.323 --> 01:12:43.416
Well, that's just rude.

01:13:06.148 --> 01:13:10.744
- What do you do so far away from home?
- I work. And I hope.

01:13:10.986 --> 01:13:14.444
- Same as me, then.
- I doubt it.

01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:20.286
You work for...?

01:13:20.529 --> 01:13:23.498
I'm an interpreter at the UN.

01:13:23.732 --> 01:13:27.828
So like the UN.
Layers of languages signifying nothing.

01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:30.834
- You'd prefer more war?
- I prefer more business.

01:13:31.073 --> 01:13:33.837
Guys, get with me here. We got a situation.

01:13:34.076 --> 01:13:39.309
No, boss, we got a situation.
We just got on the 133. With Mohammad.

01:13:39.548 --> 01:13:43.040
And Silvia Broome. And Kuman-Kuman.

01:13:43.285 --> 01:13:45.719
- What?
- You're on the same bus?

01:13:45.954 --> 01:13:47.512
With our subjects.

01:13:47.756 --> 01:13:51.351
Get off the bus,
and get Silvia Broome off that bus now.

01:13:51.593 --> 01:13:53.993
We can't do that. We're moving.

01:13:55.197 --> 01:13:57.529
Doug, is the room-mate carrying anything?

01:14:02.371 --> 01:14:05.499
- Doug, is he carrying anything?
- A satchel.

01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:12.308
- All right... where is it?
- It's in his lap. He's been carrying it all day.

01:14:12.548 --> 01:14:15.847
- Oh, man.
- Can either of you get to him?

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:20.718
Not without gettin' made.

01:14:20.956 --> 01:14:24.483
Despite all the flags on First Avenue,
there are no nations any more.

01:14:24.726 --> 01:14:30.528
Only companies. International companies.
It's where we are. It's what we are.

01:14:34.102 --> 01:14:36.229
I think you're wrong.

01:14:36.472 --> 01:14:39.873
You are still young. I'm an acquired taste.

01:14:42.511 --> 01:14:44.877
What's your brother's name?

01:14:47.182 --> 01:14:50.743
Simon. Simon Broome.

01:14:50.986 --> 01:14:54.945
- OK, we're stopping.
- You got guts, coming out here.

01:14:58.093 --> 01:15:01.256
I'll see what my people can find out about him.

01:15:01.497 --> 01:15:06.525
But remember,
I'm not your brother's keeper, eh?

01:15:06.768 --> 01:15:08.861
Yeah. Thank you.

01:15:10.672 --> 01:15:13.607
Come on, guys, talk to me. What's going on?

01:15:13.842 --> 01:15:16.436
We're stopped. She's getting off.

01:15:19.014 --> 01:15:23.110
- What's going on?
- And so is my subject.

01:15:24.319 --> 01:15:29.154
Keep talking to me. What's going on?
Is he carrying the satchel?

01:15:29.391 --> 01:15:32.417
OK, he's got the satchel.
But I think he made me.

01:15:32.661 --> 01:15:34.060
That's OK, I got him.

01:15:35.697 --> 01:15:37.722
- Kuman?
- He's staying put.

01:15:37.966 --> 01:15:40.127
Miss Broome! Please get in the car.

01:15:42.471 --> 01:15:43.768
Move it!

01:15:44.006 --> 01:15:46.065
- I got Gamba.
- I'll stay with Kuman.

01:15:46.308 --> 01:15:51.109
No. Just get off that bus.
Get everybody off that bus right now!

01:15:54.516 --> 01:15:56.245
- Doug!
- Mohammad?

01:15:57.953 --> 01:16:01.184
- Hey! Guy forgot his lunch.
- Oh, man.

01:16:22.511 --> 01:16:25.105
I'm standing here on Nostrand Avenue
in Crown Heights,

01:16:25.347 --> 01:16:28.839
at a scene that can only be described
as unconscionable carnage.

01:16:29.084 --> 01:16:33.043
...frantically helping victims
of an apparent terrorist attack.

01:16:33.288 --> 01:16:36.985
These events are more familiar
in the cities of the Middle East.

01:16:37.225 --> 01:16:41.525
There is no word yet.
However, there are unconfirmed reports

01:16:41.763 --> 01:16:46.564
that Kuman-Kuman, the exiled Matoban
revolutionary, may have been on board.

01:16:46.802 --> 01:16:48.827
- You all right?
- I'm OK.

01:16:49.071 --> 01:16:51.665
Doug?

01:16:57.913 --> 01:17:01.405
This is Ron Ferguson, reporting live
on Nostrand Avenue in Brooklyn,

01:17:01.650 --> 01:17:04.642
where just after 10.30 am this morning...

01:17:10.592 --> 01:17:12.583
We're OK, boss.

01:17:15.297 --> 01:17:19.529
[reporter]... the violence has now found
its way into the heart of New York City...

01:17:19.768 --> 01:17:24.569
- The death toll is 17, with scores injured...
- The obvious speculation about al-Qaeda...

01:17:24.806 --> 01:17:27.832
...widely seen as the probable successor
to Edmond Zuwanie...

01:17:28.076 --> 01:17:30.772
Tunnels and bridges
will close for at least 12 hours...

01:17:31.046 --> 01:17:33.708
...alleged terrorist attack by Ajene Xola...

01:17:33.949 --> 01:17:37.908
...Zuwanie is still planning to address
the General Assembly of the UN.

01:17:47.996 --> 01:17:50.897
What were you doing on that bus?

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.867
Thank you for bringing me home.

01:18:04.212 --> 01:18:06.442
Hey!

01:18:08.850 --> 01:18:11.819
I lost a man today. A kid.

01:18:14.823 --> 01:18:17.587
- How do you know Kuman?
- I never met him before.

01:18:17.826 --> 01:18:21.421
You think that not getting caught in a lie
is the same as the truth!

01:18:21.663 --> 01:18:24.791
- I'm not lying. I went to him for help.
- With what?

01:18:25.033 --> 01:18:28.002
I can't tell you. Someone might get hurt.

01:18:28.236 --> 01:18:32.468
"Someone might get hurt."
There's a bus full of dead people!

01:18:32.708 --> 01:18:35.836
"Someone might get hurt"?
Who? Someone you know?

01:18:36.111 --> 01:18:39.672
Someone who's mixed up in all this?
You? Why did you leave Africa?

01:18:39.915 --> 01:18:43.009
- I told you.
- No, you didn't. Why did you come here?

01:18:43.251 --> 01:18:45.310
- Stop it.
- Goddammit!

01:18:45.554 --> 01:18:47.454
- Stop shouting at me!
- Stop lying!

01:18:47.689 --> 01:18:49.316
- I'm not lying!
- Stop lying!

01:18:49.558 --> 01:18:54.860
I was just on that bus! I can't think
with all this noise. I can't! You have to stop!

01:19:16.184 --> 01:19:19.176
That isn't me.

01:19:19.421 --> 01:19:21.218
Don't be ridiculous.

01:19:22.657 --> 01:19:25.785
- It isn't me.
- No, that is you.

01:19:26.027 --> 01:19:28.393
And I know, because I drive you home,

01:19:28.663 --> 01:19:33.828
and I look at you through the binoculars,
and everything else that I shouldn't do.

01:19:38.073 --> 01:19:41.167
It was once.

01:19:41.409 --> 01:19:43.400
It's not any more.

01:19:45.413 --> 01:19:50.407
After the rallies,
after my parents and sister were killed,

01:19:50.652 --> 01:19:53.018
then the rifles came out.

01:19:54.623 --> 01:19:58.525
It was the only way to get anyone to listen.
Just to listen.

01:20:02.297 --> 01:20:07.826
I killed a boy who had nothing to live for
beyond the money he'd get for killing me.

01:20:09.738 --> 01:20:12.730
I shot him in the head
so he wouldn't shoot me.

01:20:18.079 --> 01:20:22.243
Then I handed the rifle to my brother
and told him, "I'm through."

01:20:22.484 --> 01:20:27.114
I walked away with him shouting at me,
"You're a coward."

01:20:27.355 --> 01:20:30.518
"Our parents are dead, Zuwanie's alive."

01:20:32.861 --> 01:20:36.957
My brother,
who in another life wouldn't harm a...

01:20:41.469 --> 01:20:44.302
That was the last thing he ever said to me.

01:20:44.539 --> 01:20:48.873
The only contact I have is the notebooks
I send and imagine him receiving.

01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:51.772
I know he's alive. I know it.

01:20:53.748 --> 01:20:55.443
But I'm not to him.

01:21:00.388 --> 01:21:03.221
I lied to you because I was afraid.

01:21:04.326 --> 01:21:07.557
I was afraid
he might be involved in what I heard.

01:21:10.665 --> 01:21:14.567
I lied to everyone else
so they'd let me near the UN,

01:21:14.803 --> 01:21:19.706
and that's the only place that I believe
has a chance to change any of this.

01:21:20.909 --> 01:21:24.242
And I lied to you about Ajene Xola because...

01:21:24.479 --> 01:21:27.209
I loved him. Once.

01:21:28.316 --> 01:21:31.774
Until the colour of my skin became a problem.

01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:34.250
The politics of my skin.

01:21:37.158 --> 01:21:42.755
I walked away from Africa with nothing.
No brother, no family, no lover, nothing.

01:21:42.998 --> 01:21:48.095
Just a belief that words and compassion
are the better way.

01:21:49.371 --> 01:21:52.101
Even if it's slower than a gun.

01:22:01.416 --> 01:22:03.646
Where are you going?

01:22:04.819 --> 01:22:07.447
You've got blood all over your face.

01:22:07.689 --> 01:22:10.988
You can't say stuff like that
with blood on your face.

01:23:53.728 --> 01:23:56.595
- [protesters shouting]
- [man speaking Ku]

01:23:56.831 --> 01:24:00.289
This is precisely why Dr Zuwanie
must be allowed to speak.

01:24:02.971 --> 01:24:05.963
[translation] This monstrous act of terrorism
was aimed at you...

01:24:08.676 --> 01:24:11.304
...and at the heart of the United Nations.

01:24:11.546 --> 01:24:15.175
- I can't listen to this.
- Do not allow them to intimidate you...

01:24:16.451 --> 01:24:17.611
...or Dr Zuwanie.

01:24:18.853 --> 01:24:21.253
[policeman] I'm not at liberty to tell you.

01:24:29.064 --> 01:24:32.397
- Where we going?
- Bathroom.

01:24:37.772 --> 01:24:39.399
Keller.

01:25:00.128 --> 01:25:03.291
Get this processed and back to me right away.

01:25:33.661 --> 01:25:36.323
Did he leave a note?

01:25:41.936 --> 01:25:44.063
Did you read it?

01:25:44.305 --> 01:25:46.569
Of course you did.

01:25:50.111 --> 01:25:53.103
Would you read it to me, please?

01:26:03.191 --> 01:26:08.788
"Dear Silvia, I came to tell you something
and then didn't."

01:26:09.931 --> 01:26:14.061
"I wanted to, but when I saw you
I couldn't find the words."

01:26:16.304 --> 01:26:20.900
"I told you I didn't know where Simon is.
That was a lie."

01:26:21.142 --> 01:26:24.600
"He was there that day.
A young boy shot him."

01:26:28.383 --> 01:26:31.819
"I couldn't tell you. I'm a coward.
Simon was braver than me."

01:26:32.053 --> 01:26:34.647
"You're braver than me. I'm so sorry."

01:26:34.889 --> 01:26:37.289
I'm so sorry.

01:26:40.628 --> 01:26:43.119
The second time was me.

01:26:57.312 --> 01:27:01.476
I feel like my friends must feel
when they try to say something.

01:27:03.751 --> 01:27:07.448
- It's all right.
- That's what I say to them.

01:27:20.768 --> 01:27:22.998
He left this with the note.

01:27:30.044 --> 01:27:33.775
The only thing that I wanted...

01:27:40.855 --> 01:27:43.483
...besides having her back...

01:27:43.725 --> 01:27:45.886
was to be left alone.

01:29:14.749 --> 01:29:17.980
[child's voice]
# My bonnie lies over the ocean #

01:29:25.059 --> 01:29:26.890
[young Simon's voice] Don't cry.

01:29:28.296 --> 01:29:32.096
- Don't cry.
- I'm not crying.

01:29:32.333 --> 01:29:34.995
- You don't have to cry.
- I'm not.

01:29:35.269 --> 01:29:38.796
Because I'm here,
and I won't leave. I promise.

01:29:40.041 --> 01:29:43.442
Look at me. I'll take care of you.

01:29:45.146 --> 01:29:47.808
[Silvia's voice] We'll take care of each other.

01:29:50.385 --> 01:29:52.580
I'll take care of you.

01:30:07.869 --> 01:30:09.962
[young Simon] Promise me.

01:30:16.544 --> 01:30:18.671
[Silvia] I promise.

01:30:37.465 --> 01:30:39.763
I promise.

01:30:49.277 --> 01:30:51.245
[thunder]

01:32:31.045 --> 01:32:33.775
[shower running]

01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:09.938
Xola's dead. Kuman's dead.

01:33:12.219 --> 01:33:14.278
Who do you work for?

01:33:15.089 --> 01:33:19.549
- Don't touch.
- Those things'll kill you.

01:33:22.597 --> 01:33:25.657
[thunder continues]

01:33:42.116 --> 01:33:43.640
Russell!

01:33:45.086 --> 01:33:47.714
[shower still running]

01:34:26.327 --> 01:34:27.351
[neighbour] Heyl

01:34:30.197 --> 01:34:32.927
[neighbours] - What the hell's going on?
- Close the doorl

01:34:37.772 --> 01:34:39.637
Silvia!

01:34:40.708 --> 01:34:43.370
- Silvia!
- [footfall]

01:34:57.158 --> 01:34:59.490
[shower still running]

01:35:13.207 --> 01:35:14.902
Silvia!

01:35:16.711 --> 01:35:18.804
Keller!

01:35:19.046 --> 01:35:20.343
Keller!

01:35:25.853 --> 01:35:29.118
She's not here. Check the roof.

01:35:39.900 --> 01:35:42.164
[siren]

01:35:46.340 --> 01:35:47.432
[Dot] Jay?

01:35:50.678 --> 01:35:54.478
- Dot, what have you got?
- There was something on her credit card.

01:35:54.715 --> 01:35:58.515
His name is Jean Gamba. He's our bomber.

01:36:00.387 --> 01:36:03.550
- And our assassin?
- That would be good for us.

01:36:03.791 --> 01:36:05.383
But I doubt it.

01:36:05.626 --> 01:36:07.218
He tried to kill her.

01:36:07.461 --> 01:36:10.589
- What happened?
- I shot him.

01:36:12.399 --> 01:36:15.994
That's a pity.
He might have told us something.

01:36:16.237 --> 01:36:19.035
- And Miss Broome?
- Gone.

01:36:19.273 --> 01:36:24.301
- He killed her?
- She was gone before he got there.

01:36:28.182 --> 01:36:31.242
- Mind if I take a look upstairs?
- Hold on. Dino?

01:36:31.485 --> 01:36:35.546
- Yeah.
- Take Mr Lud to the apartment. And Brian?

01:36:35.790 --> 01:36:41.251
- Get NYPD to push their tapeline...
- Keller? Go home and get some sleep.

01:36:41.495 --> 01:36:44.055
- I'm gonna wait for her.
- Like hell you are.

01:36:44.298 --> 01:36:49.065
I need you awake tomorrow morning.
Woods? Get him home.

01:36:54.842 --> 01:36:59.211
- Drive around the block.
- You heard Jay. I gotta take you home.

01:36:59.446 --> 01:37:04.816
What if there were two guys? Three?
We just set the trap and run? Is that it?

01:37:05.853 --> 01:37:09.687
They're not our family
and they're not our friends.

01:37:09.924 --> 01:37:11.551
You told me that.

01:37:11.792 --> 01:37:16.786
You lose somebody, you lose somebody.
I don't want to lose two somebodys.

01:37:20.668 --> 01:37:23.728
One circle, then I'm taking you home.

01:37:25.039 --> 01:37:27.030
[beeping]

01:37:45.226 --> 01:37:48.855
[Silvia] Hello? Are you there?

01:37:51.298 --> 01:37:55.701
I'm fine. I'm all right, but I...

01:37:55.936 --> 01:37:58.666
I can't talk to you.

01:37:58.906 --> 01:38:03.468
You were right.
My brother... my brother was right.

01:38:03.711 --> 01:38:07.044
It takes too long, Tobin. I'm going home.

01:38:28.502 --> 01:38:31.300
[phone ringing]

01:38:33.107 --> 01:38:34.074
Keller.

01:38:34.308 --> 01:38:38.039
Keller, Lewis. Those numbers
scribbled on Jamal's kitchen wall.

01:38:38.279 --> 01:38:42.545
Ray's Pizza, some sex lines, a hardware store
and a global cell phone.

01:38:42.783 --> 01:38:44.478
Chase down the global cell.

01:38:44.718 --> 01:38:46.652
- Keller, it's Mo.
- Go ahead, Mo.

01:38:46.887 --> 01:38:49.048
She booked a flight online.

01:38:49.290 --> 01:38:53.021
Check all flights to South Africa
out of JFK, LaGuardia and Newark.

01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:55.592
And then what? If I find her.

01:38:59.066 --> 01:39:01.193
Get her on the phone with me.

01:39:07.374 --> 01:39:09.205
He's here.

01:39:30.597 --> 01:39:33.122
That's him?

01:39:35.703 --> 01:39:36.727
Second car.

01:39:58.158 --> 01:40:01.924
Keller? Lewis.
The global cell belongs to Jean Gamba.

01:40:02.162 --> 01:40:04.357
- Got the times of the calls?
- Yeah.

01:40:04.598 --> 01:40:07.465
Day before yesterday, 3.30 pm.
Anything there?

01:40:07.701 --> 01:40:11.228
- Day before yesterday, 3.30?
- 3.30, yeah.

01:40:11.472 --> 01:40:13.963
Call it. No, have Lewis call.

01:40:14.208 --> 01:40:16.039
- I'm Lewis.
- Clark, I mean.

01:40:16.276 --> 01:40:19.040
- No, King. And he's dialling.
- Extension 647.

01:40:19.279 --> 01:40:22.305
The bus. Right after.
I want to know who he called.

01:40:22.549 --> 01:40:26.280
It's King. It's the Matoban mission.
An extension.

01:40:28.622 --> 01:40:32.888
- Lud?
- No, someone named Marcus Matu.

01:40:33.127 --> 01:40:35.755
Head over. I need a face for that name.

01:41:03.257 --> 01:41:04.986
[Mo] She's booked 9 am, JFK.

01:41:05.259 --> 01:41:08.751
- I'm on the LIE. Almost there.
- Call me from the gate.

01:41:41.361 --> 01:41:45.695
Not as much sky as I remember,
but more skyscrapers.

01:41:45.933 --> 01:41:49.630
23 years, Dr Zuwanie. Things change.

01:41:49.870 --> 01:41:51.462
They diminish.

01:41:53.273 --> 01:41:55.503
Desire diminishes.

01:41:56.610 --> 01:42:00.637
- Where is the Second Avenue?
- Just after we get off the bridge.

01:42:01.915 --> 01:42:04.748
They decorated the bridge.

01:42:04.985 --> 01:42:10.082
When I came here before, they lined
the bridge with flowers, welcoming me.

01:42:10.357 --> 01:42:12.825
- That flight departs from gate one.
- Thank you.

01:42:13.060 --> 01:42:17.827
- No sign of her. Hasn't checked in yet.
- Let me know when it's boarding.

01:42:18.065 --> 01:42:21.228
Can we hold 'em in the safe room
to buy time?

01:42:21.468 --> 01:42:24.164
You can try, but it's up to him.

01:42:28.308 --> 01:42:32.540
There was a parade.
Right here on this Second Avenue.

01:42:32.779 --> 01:42:35.213
There was a snowstorm of confetti.

01:42:42.122 --> 01:42:44.613
[indistinct shouting and chanting]

01:42:50.430 --> 01:42:51.863
[protester] Murderer!

01:42:56.470 --> 01:42:58.335
This is Second Avenue, sir.

01:43:10.951 --> 01:43:13.419
- Are you at the mission?
- Yeah, but he isn't.

01:43:13.654 --> 01:43:17.784
- Nobody knows where he is.
- They know, they just won't tell us.

01:43:18.025 --> 01:43:19.788
- You get a photo ID?
- Yeah.

01:43:20.027 --> 01:43:23.485
Go back inside
and fax that to UN security now.

01:43:23.730 --> 01:43:26.221
Get his address and get over there.

01:43:26.466 --> 01:43:28.457
I've got eight minutes.

01:44:02.035 --> 01:44:03.366
[Dot] Keep it tight.

01:44:21.421 --> 01:44:23.446
Agent Keller!

01:44:37.604 --> 01:44:41.370
He's here. I just saw him.
Broadcast that description.

01:44:57.491 --> 01:45:00.790
49th... 42nd.

01:45:02.062 --> 01:45:03.859
Good. Next.

01:45:04.097 --> 01:45:06.463
Move on.

01:45:18.378 --> 01:45:20.505
There it is.

01:45:30.123 --> 01:45:32.648
- OK.
- All right, go.

01:45:38.165 --> 01:45:41.157
- Levels, please.
- Un, deux, trois...

01:45:55.782 --> 01:46:00.583
Ladies and gentlemen, British Airways
flight 178 to Johannesburg is ready to close.

01:46:00.821 --> 01:46:03.619
Please make your way
to gate one immediately. Thank you.

01:46:03.857 --> 01:46:09.090
- Thank you. Levels, please.
- [counting in Russian]

01:46:51.938 --> 01:46:57.877
The Assembly will first hear an address
by the President of the Republic of Matobo.

01:46:58.111 --> 01:47:00.375
On behalf of the General Assembly,

01:47:00.614 --> 01:47:03.276
I have the honour to welcome
to the United Nations

01:47:03.517 --> 01:47:08.819
His Excellency Dr Edmond Zuwanie,
President of the Republic of Matobo,

01:47:09.055 --> 01:47:12.354
and to invite him to address the Assembly.

01:47:12.592 --> 01:47:14.389
[smattering of applause]

01:47:24.070 --> 01:47:27.369
Mr President, Mr Secretary-General.

01:47:27.607 --> 01:47:30.508
Today my beloved country is under siege.

01:47:30.744 --> 01:47:33.736
As you saw the other afternoon
across the river in Brooklyn,

01:47:33.980 --> 01:47:37.143
the terrorists in my country will stop at nothing.

01:47:37.384 --> 01:47:41.548
How am I to defend my country
against enemies like these?

01:47:41.788 --> 01:47:45.246
- I admit I have dealt harshly with terrorists...
- Tobin, it's King.

01:47:45.492 --> 01:47:48.052
...as we all will have to.
- I don't think Matu's here.

01:47:48.295 --> 01:47:52.095
Remember the profile of suicide bombers
and how there isn't one?

01:47:52.332 --> 01:47:54.994
...who know the evil
and violence of real terrorism...

01:47:55.235 --> 01:47:58.500
Your mother and sister
will get their cheque on Monday.

01:47:58.738 --> 01:48:02.071
- This isn't his apartment.
- You did well.

01:48:02.309 --> 01:48:05.403
No one here will live long.
It's an AIDS hospice.

01:48:05.645 --> 01:48:10.708
...with a reciprocal and immediate violence...
- My opinion? It's a con.

01:48:10.951 --> 01:48:13.351
I have been forced to do this.

01:48:13.587 --> 01:48:18.024
It is the hope and specific goal
of my administration

01:48:18.258 --> 01:48:22.524
- to reform these brutal methods...
- Get him off the podium.

01:48:22.762 --> 01:48:26.528
- To participate in the formation...
- We've got to go.

01:48:26.766 --> 01:48:28.859
But I want to speak!

01:48:30.871 --> 01:48:32.395
[click]

01:48:34.140 --> 01:48:35.664
[screaming]

01:48:37.978 --> 01:48:40.242
Come on, sir, run!

01:48:45.785 --> 01:48:49.221
[alarm blares]

01:49:00.166 --> 01:49:01.758
He's OK.

01:49:02.002 --> 01:49:04.402
- Cover here. I'll take the hall.
- Where's Keller?

01:49:04.638 --> 01:49:06.196
Freeze!

01:49:17.217 --> 01:49:20.618
Incredible. Thank God I looked up.

01:49:20.854 --> 01:49:23.288
- He's from our mission.
- I know. Holster your weapon.

01:49:25.725 --> 01:49:28.023
Dr Zuwanie.

01:49:29.429 --> 01:49:31.488
I remember the last time you were here.

01:49:31.731 --> 01:49:37.363
- [security] Use the 42nd Street exit.
- We almost had an assassination here.

01:49:37.604 --> 01:49:39.196
[security] Please move...

01:49:39.439 --> 01:49:43.000
We watched you on the telly back home.

01:49:43.243 --> 01:49:47.839
My family. All the families.
You were like the Beatles.

01:49:48.081 --> 01:49:52.279
Two or three more seconds,
he would have assassinated him.

01:49:52.519 --> 01:49:55.682
An almost-assassinated leader
gets so much credibility

01:49:55.922 --> 01:49:59.824
so he can stay in power
and gets to stick around to enjoy it.

01:50:00.060 --> 01:50:02.824
We were so proud of you.

01:50:04.831 --> 01:50:08.790
There you were, speaking to the world.

01:50:11.871 --> 01:50:14.465
I don't think you should touch...

01:50:16.276 --> 01:50:18.301
Because I'm not wearing a glove?

01:50:18.545 --> 01:50:21.275
What is your name, child?

01:50:23.450 --> 01:50:25.816
I'm the Silvia whose family you killed.

01:50:27.621 --> 01:50:30.488
- What's in your hand?
- It's... Just a precaution.

01:50:30.724 --> 01:50:35.354
What's in your hand?
He must've been very surprised.

01:50:35.595 --> 01:50:37.825
He thought it was a live round.

01:50:40.233 --> 01:50:43.168
- Where is everyone?
- But you knew better.

01:50:45.805 --> 01:50:46.999
[click]

01:50:52.912 --> 01:50:54.311
Give me the live round.

01:50:57.150 --> 01:51:02.417
I grew up seeing you with this gun.
It's the gun you saved our country with.

01:51:02.656 --> 01:51:05.022
- Drop the gun!
- Put it down!

01:51:05.258 --> 01:51:07.419
Keller, US Secret Service.

01:51:08.328 --> 01:51:11.627
It's the same one you used to kill it.

01:51:11.865 --> 01:51:15.767
- He's got a Glock on his hip.
- Code 100 in the sound room.

01:51:23.810 --> 01:51:25.209
Look at it.

01:51:30.216 --> 01:51:31.547
Look at it!

01:51:36.423 --> 01:51:40.917
- Careful. The bleeder had AIDS.
- There's no way you can prove this.

01:51:41.161 --> 01:51:44.096
You'll cop a plea.
You're just an employee, right?

01:51:44.330 --> 01:51:48.596
- He's in custody. They're bringing him down.
- SWAT team's at 42nd Street.

01:51:50.070 --> 01:51:52.265
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Where's Zuwanie?

01:51:52.505 --> 01:51:55.133
- The safe room. What happened?
- It was a fake.

01:51:55.375 --> 01:51:59.573
A piece of theatre to justify the killing.
Ethnic cleansing, genocide.

01:51:59.813 --> 01:52:03.010
You there? That's the flight. She's not on it.

01:52:03.249 --> 01:52:05.774
I checked every hotel in New York,
her friends.

01:52:06.019 --> 01:52:09.011
They don't know where she'd go.
No one knows her.

01:52:09.255 --> 01:52:12.349
- I know her.
- OK, where is she?

01:52:12.592 --> 01:52:15.755
- She said she was going home.
- [Silvia] I'm going home...

01:52:15.995 --> 01:52:17.326
What home?

01:52:17.564 --> 01:52:21.523
- How'd you happen to be there after hours?
- [Silvia] An evacuation. I left some things.

01:52:21.768 --> 01:52:24.601
It takes too long...
I wouldn't mind if he were gone.

01:52:24.838 --> 01:52:27.272
She's here. She's been in that room all night.

01:52:27.507 --> 01:52:31.773
How could someone so good, so...

01:52:32.912 --> 01:52:35.540
How could you give us so much,

01:52:36.716 --> 01:52:38.115
so much...

01:52:40.086 --> 01:52:42.145
then take away more?

01:52:43.623 --> 01:52:46.717
- He in there?
- Yeah.

01:52:48.728 --> 01:52:51.026
Keep everybody out.

01:52:52.132 --> 01:52:54.157
Silvia?

01:52:54.400 --> 01:52:55.560
Silvia?

01:52:57.303 --> 01:52:59.533
It's me.

01:52:59.773 --> 01:53:02.742
I'm coming in alone. I'm coming in.

01:53:04.544 --> 01:53:06.671
Five minutes.

01:53:11.284 --> 01:53:13.980
Close it.

01:53:14.220 --> 01:53:17.917
- Close it!
- Silvia, don't do this.

01:53:18.158 --> 01:53:22.561
It was all just theatre, an almost-assassination
meant to justify his acts.

01:53:22.796 --> 01:53:26.323
- We've got all we need to prosecute.
- I have him.

01:53:26.566 --> 01:53:30.024
- He'll die in prison.
- I want him to die how Simon died.

01:53:30.270 --> 01:53:33.831
That'll be over in two seconds,
and you'll have all your years.

01:53:34.073 --> 01:53:37.907
Sir, it's a lot worse than you think.
Your so-called assassin is dead.

01:53:38.144 --> 01:53:40.704
Your head of security is making a deal.

01:53:40.947 --> 01:53:44.906
We have Lud and the rifle.
You'll be tried before two courts.

01:53:45.151 --> 01:53:48.052
- He's been tried!
- Sir, you're finished.

01:53:48.288 --> 01:53:53.521
- It doesn't matter!
- Silvia. Listen to me.

01:53:53.760 --> 01:53:56.388
I told you I'd let him drown.

01:53:56.629 --> 01:53:59.894
The man who drove my wife
into a bridge abutment.

01:54:02.101 --> 01:54:05.036
- But I wouldn't.
- Then you'd be wrong.

01:54:05.271 --> 01:54:10.140
No, I wouldn't be wrong. I don't want
to spend the rest of my life in mourning.

01:54:16.115 --> 01:54:18.140
[cocks gun]

01:54:21.721 --> 01:54:24.383
You have to get out of here.

01:54:24.624 --> 01:54:28.082
I can't do that. So put the gun down.

01:54:29.128 --> 01:54:32.564
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. Put it down.

01:54:32.799 --> 01:54:36.098
I can't! I can't... I can't.

01:54:36.803 --> 01:54:38.464
Just go.

01:54:52.852 --> 01:54:55.184
This is how it's done.

01:55:03.396 --> 01:55:05.830
This is how you put a gun down.

01:55:17.076 --> 01:55:18.873
Please.

01:55:21.114 --> 01:55:24.481
You shoot him, he'll be dead...

01:55:26.986 --> 01:55:29.614
...but then you'll be dead...

01:55:31.824 --> 01:55:34.554
...and I don't know what I'll be.

01:55:40.266 --> 01:55:42.427
Put it down.

01:55:45.405 --> 01:55:47.305
Read it!

01:55:48.441 --> 01:55:50.136
Read it.

01:55:51.277 --> 01:55:54.371
- Where?
- The beginning. Read it.

01:56:01.220 --> 01:56:05.657
- "The gunfire around us..."
- Louder. Like when you wrote it.

01:56:06.926 --> 01:56:09.759
When you believed it.

01:56:09.996 --> 01:56:12.055
When you meant it.

01:56:17.136 --> 01:56:22.733
"The gunfire around us makes it hard to hear."

01:56:25.178 --> 01:56:31.117
"But the human voice
is different from other sounds."

01:56:34.821 --> 01:56:40.350
- "It can be heard...
- "It can be heard over...

01:56:40.593 --> 01:56:45.428
over noises that bury everything else.""Even...

01:56:47.100 --> 01:56:51.093
- "Even...
- "Even when it's not shouting."

01:56:51.337 --> 01:56:53.737
"Shouting." "Even when it...

01:56:53.973 --> 01:56:57.807
"Even if it's just a whisper."

01:57:02.582 --> 01:57:08.521
"Even the lowest whisper
can be heard over armies...

01:57:09.756 --> 01:57:11.314
[Silvia] "When...

01:57:13.459 --> 01:57:17.862
- "When...
..."when it's telling the truth."

01:57:36.649 --> 01:57:39.277
That little boy was my country.

01:58:26.199 --> 01:58:27.757
[Silvia] Hove Vambi...

01:58:30.103 --> 01:58:32.503
...killed by land-mines.

01:58:33.406 --> 01:58:35.271
Alexander Mungoshi...

01:58:36.776 --> 01:58:38.676
Charles Kufomo...

01:58:40.246 --> 01:58:42.305
Ruth Kufomo...

01:58:44.717 --> 01:58:47.811
...shot to death defending their home.

01:59:12.445 --> 01:59:15.414
- [GA President] Let the record show...
- Steven Gawanda...

01:59:15.648 --> 01:59:18.879
...that the Security Council...
- Solo Gawanda...

01:59:19.118 --> 01:59:22.281
...has unanimously commanded...
- Steven Shamere...

01:59:22.522 --> 01:59:27.550
...that President Zuwanie of Matobo...

01:59:27.793 --> 01:59:32.958
...be tried at the International Criminal Court
in The Hague

01:59:41.474 --> 01:59:45.535
shot to death in a soccer stadium.

02:00:18.711 --> 02:00:20.611
How did you make out?

02:00:20.846 --> 02:00:24.009
They said you told them I wasn't a danger.

02:00:24.250 --> 02:00:27.879
- I lied.
- Thank you.

02:00:28.988 --> 02:00:31.456
They didn't believe you.

02:00:33.025 --> 02:00:37.962
They're sending me back.
I wanted to say goodbye.

02:00:39.699 --> 02:00:43.191
It's OK. I'm going home.

02:00:46.606 --> 02:00:48.437
We never...

02:00:48.674 --> 02:00:52.110
I never had time to tell you
how much I miss Africa.

02:00:53.279 --> 02:00:56.715
We never had time for a lot of things.

02:01:01.687 --> 02:01:05.123
You don't have anyone left there, do you?

02:01:05.358 --> 02:01:07.690
No, it's where I remember them.

02:01:12.365 --> 02:01:14.925
Ever been to Africa?

02:01:16.869 --> 02:01:19.064
Lot of airports, no lions.

02:01:26.512 --> 02:01:29.481
- When are you leaving?
- Tomorrow.

02:01:31.450 --> 02:01:33.008
Wow.

02:01:37.723 --> 02:01:40.658
Hey, look at this. We're not kepéla any more.

02:01:43.229 --> 02:01:45.561
We're on the same side.

02:01:47.667 --> 02:01:51.660
You never know
who you're going to meet, do you?

02:01:51.904 --> 02:01:53.599
No.

02:01:56.642 --> 02:01:58.837
Will you let me know how you are?

02:02:08.421 --> 02:02:10.981
You'll always know.

02:02:25.671 --> 02:02:27.571
What was her name?
