MAN: Tonight, look upon the evl

00:04.872 --> 00:06.874
that you did.

00:06.907 --> 00:10.744
ANNOUNCER: A Christmas Carol
premieres December 19 at 7:30
on FX.

00:12.846 --> 00:15.949
FX presents Mr. InBetween.

00:40.774 --> 00:42.110
(engine stops)

00:51.452 --> 00:52.920
You're not worried?

00:52.953 --> 00:54.888
About what?

00:54.922 --> 00:56.924
What if he's booby-trapped
the bags or something?

00:56.957 --> 00:59.127
I mean, the last time
you tried to dig up a stash,

00:59.160 --> 01:00.894
I nearly got my fuckin' head
blown off. Remember that?

01:00.928 --> 01:02.530
Hmm?

01:02.563 --> 01:04.332
(chuckles)
Got to be careful.

01:07.801 --> 01:09.503
(Dave exhales)

01:14.074 --> 01:16.710
Get out.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.346
(Alex grunts)

01:22.416 --> 01:23.817
(grunts)

01:26.420 --> 01:28.256
So where is it?

01:30.191 --> 01:32.059
-It's pretty close.
-How close?

01:32.092 --> 01:33.261
Just over there.

01:33.294 --> 01:35.296
Let me tell you something.

01:35.329 --> 01:37.631
If you move from this spot
before we get the cash,

01:37.665 --> 01:40.468
I swear to fucking God,
I'll blow your head off.

01:40.501 --> 01:42.069
-Understood.
-DAVE: Right.

01:42.102 --> 01:43.271
Money better be there.

01:43.304 --> 01:44.472
It's there.

01:44.505 --> 01:46.274
What about the cuffs?

01:46.307 --> 01:47.841
What about 'em?

01:47.875 --> 01:50.244
Well, I can't get very fucking
far with these around my legs,

01:50.278 --> 01:51.445
can I?

01:51.479 --> 01:52.780
Well, that's the point.

01:52.813 --> 01:54.915
(sighs)
Come on, mate. Fair is fair.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.517
(mumbles):
Fair is fair. Fair is fair.

01:56.550 --> 01:57.851
Uh-huh.

01:57.885 --> 02:00.188
Oh, you fuck!

02:00.221 --> 02:01.522
Oh!

02:01.555 --> 02:03.023
(coughing)

02:03.056 --> 02:04.958
That's for Vinnie, you prick.

02:04.992 --> 02:07.195
(coughing continues)

02:07.228 --> 02:08.829
(coughs mockingly)

02:08.862 --> 02:10.664
(coughing)

02:10.698 --> 02:12.099
(spits)

02:12.132 --> 02:13.334
What direction?

02:15.336 --> 02:16.337
(Alex sniffs)

02:16.370 --> 02:18.138
-Over there.
-Where?

02:18.172 --> 02:19.573
Over there.

02:21.041 --> 02:23.043
(grunts, spits)

02:23.076 --> 02:24.845
(groans)

02:24.878 --> 02:26.880
-This way?
-No, stop.

02:26.914 --> 02:28.115
No, left.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.550
Go left.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.151
A bit more.

02:31.185 --> 02:32.886
Keep going.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.388
Straight.
Bit more right.

02:34.422 --> 02:36.056
-Bit more right.
-This way?

02:36.089 --> 02:38.326
Yep, straight.

02:38.359 --> 02:40.060
-Keep going.
-Keep going?

02:40.093 --> 02:41.562
Yeah, yep, there.

02:41.595 --> 02:43.597
-Here?
-Yeah.

03:08.289 --> 03:11.525
-Fucking hell, mate.
-(chuckles)

03:11.559 --> 03:13.561
(digging continues)

03:23.604 --> 03:26.039
Put some fucking elbow grease
into it, Ray.

03:30.644 --> 03:32.280
I got something.

03:42.590 --> 03:44.758
-Oi!
-Hey! Damn it.

03:44.792 --> 03:45.893
Ah, fuck!

03:48.228 --> 03:50.298
Who the fuck is that shooting?

03:52.666 --> 03:54.335
Fuck!

04:01.609 --> 04:03.611
Fuck!

04:26.266 --> 04:27.701
(rustling in distance)

04:30.871 --> 04:32.272
Dave?

04:32.306 --> 04:33.574
Oh, fuck!

04:33.607 --> 04:35.643
You... What the fuck
are you doing?

04:35.676 --> 04:37.010
Fucking idiot!

04:37.044 --> 04:38.446
Don't crack the shits.

04:38.479 --> 04:40.013
(whispers):
Come on.

04:40.047 --> 04:42.215
Around here.

04:44.885 --> 04:46.119
-(thump in distance)
-(groaning)

04:46.153 --> 04:48.489
What the fuck?

04:50.190 --> 04:52.793
(groaning in distance)

04:52.826 --> 04:54.628
Come on.

05:02.570 --> 05:05.606
-GARY: Careful, it's barbwire.
-RAY: What have you done?

05:05.639 --> 05:07.007
GARY:
Think I fucked me back.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.141
Who the fuck is this clown?

05:08.175 --> 05:09.877
RAY:
Gaz, Dave.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.679
Pleased to meet you.

05:11.712 --> 05:14.014
-DAVE: You the one
doing the shooting?
-That's me.

05:14.047 --> 05:16.116
So why the fuck wouldn't you
tell me about that, Ray?

05:16.149 --> 05:17.885
Well, I figured
it'd be better, mate,

05:17.918 --> 05:19.319
if you didn't know
what was going on.

05:19.353 --> 05:20.988
We're never gonna find him now,

05:21.021 --> 05:21.989
so let's just
go get the money, eh?

05:22.022 --> 05:24.324
RAY:
Yeah, let's do that.

05:24.358 --> 05:26.794
-(groaning in distance)
-What the fuck was that?

05:26.827 --> 05:29.563
Fucked if I know.
Come on, let's go.

05:29.597 --> 05:30.864
(stammers)

05:30.898 --> 05:32.466
Which way is it?

05:32.500 --> 05:34.067
That way.

05:34.101 --> 05:35.536
Come on.

05:35.569 --> 05:36.870
(Gary softly groaning)

05:41.542 --> 05:43.877
(exhales)
Fuck.

05:45.245 --> 05:47.247
-(groaning)
-GARY: Ah!

05:54.522 --> 05:55.989
(howling in distance)

05:56.023 --> 05:57.791
Fuck was that?

06:00.628 --> 06:02.630
It's a full moon.

06:08.101 --> 06:10.337
So it's a werewolf, is it?

06:10.370 --> 06:12.105
-No, I'm just saying.
-Mm.

06:12.139 --> 06:14.141
(grunting softly)

06:19.046 --> 06:20.714
-(bleating in distance)
-(yelps)

06:25.085 --> 06:27.254
-Fuck.
-Fuck this shit.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.791
-You go, Gary.
-No, you go.

06:30.824 --> 06:33.794
-Go together.
-All right.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.796
Come on.

06:37.465 --> 06:39.467
(groaning softly)

06:42.302 --> 06:44.605
(whispers):
Ray!

06:44.638 --> 06:46.740
(grunting)

06:49.977 --> 06:51.979
Hmm. Mm-hmm.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.918
Happy?

06:58.952 --> 07:00.053
Yeah, we're happy.

07:00.087 --> 07:02.089
Beauty.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.939
You all right?

07:22.943 --> 07:24.377
Come on.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.190
(Ray grunts softly)

08:01.715 --> 08:04.718
(shovel digging)

08:25.873 --> 08:28.676
(sniffling)

08:33.413 --> 08:35.415
Hmm.
Okay, come on.

08:54.301 --> 08:55.736
(sighs softly)

09:04.444 --> 09:05.512
Knock, knock.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.547
Entrez vous.

09:12.152 --> 09:14.054
I'm gonna pick up Britt.

09:16.089 --> 09:19.059
She's at netball, so...

09:19.092 --> 09:20.460
Back in about 15.

09:20.493 --> 09:22.129
Okay.

09:24.732 --> 09:26.133
(Ray grunts softly)

09:30.904 --> 09:33.573
Uh, hey, I was going to ask you.

09:33.607 --> 09:36.109
Would it be okay if Britt and I

09:36.143 --> 09:38.979
spend a little
one-on-one time today?

09:39.012 --> 09:41.548
Mm. You want me to take you
somewhere, or...

09:41.581 --> 09:45.318
No. Would be good just
to hang out here, I think.

09:45.352 --> 09:47.120
Yeah.

09:47.154 --> 09:48.822
Yeah.
Yeah, cool, mate.

09:48.856 --> 09:50.290
You want anything
down the street?

09:50.323 --> 09:51.659
No, I'm all good.

09:51.692 --> 09:53.661
All right, mate.
I'll see you in a bit.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.128
Mm.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.078
(gulps, sighs)

10:11.111 --> 10:12.312
(grunts)

10:18.819 --> 10:21.288
(chuckles):
Yeah.

10:21.321 --> 10:24.491
"Thy husband in thy bosom
there lies dead;

10:24.524 --> 10:25.859
"And Paris, too.

10:25.893 --> 10:27.795
"Come, I'll dispose of thee

10:27.828 --> 10:31.198
"Among a sisterhood
of holy nuns:

10:31.231 --> 10:34.702
"Stay not to question,
for the watch is coming;

10:34.735 --> 10:38.772
Come, go, good Juliet,
I dare stay no longer."

10:38.806 --> 10:41.374
"Go, get thee hence,
for I will not away.

10:41.408 --> 10:44.812
"What's here? A cup,
closed in my true love's hand?

10:44.845 --> 10:47.647
"Poison, I see,
hath been his timeless end:

10:47.681 --> 10:50.650
"O churl! Drunk all,
and left no friendly drop

10:50.684 --> 10:51.852
"To help me after?

10:51.885 --> 10:53.286
"I will kiss thy lips;

10:53.320 --> 10:55.823
"Haply some poison
yet doth hang on them,

10:55.856 --> 10:57.825
"To make die with a restorative.

10:59.426 --> 11:01.194
"Thy lips are warm.

11:01.228 --> 11:02.730
"Yea, noise?
Then I'll be brief.

11:02.763 --> 11:04.064
"O happy dagger,

11:04.097 --> 11:05.866
"This is thy sheath;

11:05.899 --> 11:07.300
(grunts)

11:07.334 --> 11:10.137
There rust, and let me die."

11:10.170 --> 11:12.372
Bravo!
(laughs)

11:12.405 --> 11:14.007
Bravo.

11:14.041 --> 11:16.243
Very good.

11:16.276 --> 11:17.745
Let's do it again.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.104
Done.

11:44.137 --> 11:46.106
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

11:48.141 --> 11:49.777
Bye.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.556
(Bruce sniffles)

12:05.826 --> 12:07.227
Why are you crying?

12:07.260 --> 12:09.262
-I'm not.
-Yeah, you are.

12:12.632 --> 12:15.102
I'm just sad
'cause I'm gonna miss you.

12:15.135 --> 12:16.536
Why are you sad?

12:16.569 --> 12:19.139
You're going to see me
next weekend.

12:19.172 --> 12:20.407
Hmm.
(chuckles)

12:20.440 --> 12:22.642
Okay, I won't be sad.

12:24.277 --> 12:25.678
Bye.

12:27.314 --> 12:28.949
I'll see you, mate.

12:32.820 --> 12:34.454
(door opens)

12:38.826 --> 12:41.494
(sniffles)

12:41.528 --> 12:43.163
(door closes)

12:46.967 --> 12:48.969
(birds singing)

13:17.530 --> 13:19.532
(birds singing)

13:25.472 --> 13:27.474
(vehicle approaching)

13:49.997 --> 13:51.831
(sighs)

14:08.748 --> 14:10.183
(sighs)

14:18.725 --> 14:20.127
(Ray grunts)

14:34.574 --> 14:35.976
(Ray sighs)

14:44.717 --> 14:47.720
Remember when
you shat in the bath?

14:50.157 --> 14:51.591
You shat in the bath.

14:51.624 --> 14:53.260
What?

14:53.293 --> 14:56.796
You were sitting up that end,
and I was up that end.

14:56.829 --> 14:59.132
Huh?
You shat in the bath.

15:01.134 --> 15:03.136
-It was me?
-Yeah.

15:03.170 --> 15:05.138
(Bruce chuckles)

15:05.172 --> 15:07.774
And every time I moved,
all it'd do is

15:07.807 --> 15:09.977
-suck the bloody turd
closer to me.
-(chuckles)

15:10.010 --> 15:13.580
And I was screaming at Mum,
screaming my head off.

15:13.613 --> 15:14.647
BRUCE:
Yeah.

15:18.918 --> 15:23.190
Fuck. I spent two nights
in the cooler for that.

15:25.258 --> 15:26.793
-So you should've.
-(chuckles)

15:26.826 --> 15:28.128
(laughs)

15:31.464 --> 15:33.633
BRUCE:
I want you to do
something for me.

15:33.666 --> 15:36.136
(bottle opens)

15:36.169 --> 15:37.837
What?

15:37.870 --> 15:39.839
Forgive the old man.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.344
No.

15:44.377 --> 15:46.346
You got to let it go, mate.

15:46.379 --> 15:48.015
-No, I don't.
-You have to, mate.

15:48.048 --> 15:49.649
No.

15:49.682 --> 15:53.120
Holding a grudge
against someone is like

15:53.153 --> 15:57.190
drinking poison and
expecting them to get sick.

15:57.224 --> 15:59.026
-Hmm?
-(laughs)

15:59.059 --> 16:00.460
Where'd you get that from?

16:00.493 --> 16:03.163
-The Dalai Lama.
-(laughs)

16:07.734 --> 16:10.737
You're holding onto it, mate.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.641
I don't think about it.
You know?

16:14.674 --> 16:16.343
I don't think about
that shit anymore.

16:16.376 --> 16:19.179
-You know?
-Yeah. Wh-When I was saying...

16:19.212 --> 16:22.282
-I seen the old man
the other day.
-Mm.

16:22.315 --> 16:24.684
-I went to say goodbye to him.
-Mm.

16:24.717 --> 16:28.321
I gave him a hug
and I said, "I love you."

16:30.890 --> 16:32.692
And when I walked out of there,

16:32.725 --> 16:34.994
I felt like I was
ten tons lighter.

16:35.028 --> 16:36.196
-Mm.
-You know?

16:36.229 --> 16:38.865
-Mm.
-Because I forgave him.

16:41.434 --> 16:44.037
And till I forgave him,
you know,

16:44.071 --> 16:47.140
-I didn't realize the weight.
-Mm.

16:47.174 --> 16:49.709
You don't realize the weight
t-that you're carrying

16:49.742 --> 16:52.712
-till you put it down.
-Hmm.

16:52.745 --> 16:54.947
Promise me you'll try.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.018
I'll try.

17:02.422 --> 17:06.859
I just want you
to be happy, mate.

17:06.893 --> 17:08.895
Yeah, I know.

17:18.738 --> 17:22.242
BRUCE:
Remember the... those

17:22.275 --> 17:26.213
schoolbooks we used to have
in the... in the bookcase?

17:26.246 --> 17:27.847
-Mm, hmm.
-Hmm?

17:27.880 --> 17:31.684
There was a science book,
a physics book.

17:31.718 --> 17:34.854
-It's like a law of physics.
-Mm.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.956
It was telling me, like,

17:36.989 --> 17:40.727
mat-matter cannot
cease to exist,

17:40.760 --> 17:43.430
it can only change forms.

17:43.463 --> 17:45.432
Something like that.

17:45.465 --> 17:47.567
-Well, that doesn't seem right.
-Yeah, that's what I thought.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.436
I said, "Well, that
sounds like bullshit.

17:49.469 --> 17:50.903
-Mm.
-(chuckles)

17:50.937 --> 17:53.072
But here's the thing.

17:53.106 --> 17:56.809
Say, like, a piece of wood.

17:56.843 --> 17:59.112
Huh?
If you burn it,

17:59.146 --> 18:02.048
does it cease to exist?

18:02.081 --> 18:04.651
-Yeah.
-No, it doesn't.

18:04.684 --> 18:08.321
-Yeah.
-No, no, no. It turns to ash.

18:08.355 --> 18:10.290
It changes form,

18:10.323 --> 18:13.460
but it still exists as ash.

18:15.995 --> 18:18.398
Yeah.
So-so, what are you saying?

18:18.431 --> 18:20.400
W-Well, I'm matter.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.302
-Yeah.
-Right?

18:22.335 --> 18:23.903
I-I'm matter, right?

18:23.936 --> 18:25.138
Y-You're matter.

18:25.172 --> 18:27.640
We're all matter.

18:30.877 --> 18:34.113
We... You cannot cease to exist.

18:34.147 --> 18:37.717
We can only change form.

18:41.854 --> 18:43.856
(laughs softly)

18:46.493 --> 18:48.328
So nobody dies?

18:49.796 --> 18:51.798
Yeah.

18:55.502 --> 18:58.371
-Nobody dies.
-Mm.

18:59.639 --> 19:03.042
-Nobody dies.
-(sniffles)

19:12.185 --> 19:14.187
(sniffles)

19:29.168 --> 19:31.170
(grunts)

19:41.180 --> 19:44.016
So, you want to get
this show on the road?

19:48.187 --> 19:50.189
No.

20:20.152 --> 20:22.154
(exhales)

20:28.160 --> 20:30.129
(grunts softly)

20:30.162 --> 20:32.164
(inhales sharply)

20:55.322 --> 20:57.324
(exhales)

21:21.548 --> 21:24.384
Thanks for this, mate.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.289
No worries.

22:00.052 --> 22:01.488
(sniffles)

22:03.523 --> 22:05.525
Gonna miss you.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.162
Same.

22:31.784 --> 22:33.786
(exhales)

23:29.476 --> 23:31.478
(liquid splashing)

25:21.554 --> 25:25.758
* Someday my pain *

25:28.527 --> 25:32.198
* Someday, my pain *

25:32.231 --> 25:35.501
* Will mark you *

25:35.534 --> 25:39.438
* Harness your blame *

25:41.440 --> 25:45.344
* Harness your blame *

25:45.377 --> 25:47.279
* And walk through *

25:53.219 --> 25:55.121
* With the wild wolves *

25:55.154 --> 25:59.058
* Around you *

26:01.060 --> 26:02.128
* In the morning *

26:02.161 --> 26:05.932
* I'll call you *

26:05.965 --> 26:09.836
* Send it farther on *

26:17.677 --> 26:21.580
* Solace my game. *
