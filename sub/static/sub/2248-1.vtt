KUNG FU PANDA-2 (2011)

00:21.273 --> 00:24.274
<i>Long ago, in ancient China,</i>

00:24.443 --> 00:27.647
<i>the Peacocks ruled over Gongmen City.</i>

00:28.447 --> 00:32.280
<i>They brought great joy
and prosperity to the city</i>

00:32.452 --> 00:35.785
<i>for they had invented fireworks.</i>

00:39.167 --> 00:41.919
<i>But their son, Lord Shen,</i>

00:42.087 --> 00:45.503
<i>saw darker power in the fireworks.</i>

00:46.717 --> 00:49.208
<i>What had brought colour and joy</i>

00:49.387 --> 00:53.764
<i>could also bring darkness
and destruction.</i>

00:53.933 --> 00:57.717
<i>Shen's troubled parents
consulted a soothsayer.</i>

00:57.896 --> 01:03.187
<i>She foretold that if Shen
continued down this dark path,</i>

01:03.360 --> 01:08.355
<i>he would be defeated
by a warrior of black and white.</i>

01:09.491 --> 01:13.110
<i>The young lord
set out to change his fate.</i>

01:13.287 --> 01:18.115
<i>But what he did next only sealed it.</i>

01:23.131 --> 01:26.999
<i>Shen returned to his parents
full of pride.</i>

01:27.177 --> 01:31.306
<i>But in their faces, he saw only horror.</i>

01:33.058 --> 01:35.894
<i>He was banished from the city forever.</i>

01:36.062 --> 01:39.265
<i>But Shen swore revenge.</i>

01:39.440 --> 01:42.276
<i>Someday he would return</i>

01:42.444 --> 01:46.311
<i>and all of China would bow at his feet.</i>

02:17.773 --> 02:20.691
It's almost done, Lord Shen,
but we've run out of metal.

02:22.278 --> 02:26.775
Search the farthest villages!
Find more metal!

02:26.950 --> 02:28.824
China will be mine.

02:38.963 --> 02:42.166
And then the Dragon Warrior
joined the Furious Five!

02:42.341 --> 02:45.212
And they became the most
awesomest kung fu team ever!

02:45.386 --> 02:47.213
Enough talk. Let's fight!

02:48.473 --> 02:49.552
- Thirty-three...
- Listen, listen!

02:49.724 --> 02:52.050
You can hear the Dragon Warrior
training right now!

02:52.227 --> 02:53.638
Thirty-three. Stop him!

02:53.812 --> 02:55.057
- Thirty-four.
- It's too dangerous!

02:55.230 --> 02:57.556
- Thirty-five. Stay focused.
- Thirty-six!

02:57.733 --> 02:59.393
- Thirty-seven!
- Yeah!

02:59.568 --> 03:02.024
How is he doing that with his face?

03:05.741 --> 03:08.363
Thirty-eight bean buns!

03:08.536 --> 03:11.074
Yes! New record! You monster!

03:11.247 --> 03:13.536
- Keep going! Hit 40!
- He'll never hit 40.

03:13.708 --> 03:15.915
You guys wait and we'll go to 40.

03:16.086 --> 03:17.201
Do it.

03:17.379 --> 03:18.790
No problem!

03:21.800 --> 03:23.544
Yeah!

03:24.678 --> 03:26.089
Give me a minute.

03:27.348 --> 03:28.759
Yeah!

03:29.767 --> 03:31.974
- He did it!
- Well done, Po!

03:33.563 --> 03:34.974
Your training has paid off.

03:36.274 --> 03:38.350
Master Shifu!
Gotta go. See you later!

03:39.403 --> 03:41.442
You'll save those for me, right?

03:49.872 --> 03:51.283
Flippety-do.

04:01.927 --> 04:03.505
Inner peace.

04:06.515 --> 04:09.006
Inner peace.

04:12.271 --> 04:14.098
Inner peace.

04:14.273 --> 04:15.684
Master Shifu.

04:16.651 --> 04:18.560
Master Shifu, what do we got?

04:18.737 --> 04:21.654
Pirates? Vandals of Volcano Mountain?

04:21.822 --> 04:25.868
Whatever it is, I will take them down.
'Cause I am in a mood.

04:26.036 --> 04:28.444
I need to get something done,
you know what I mean?

04:30.374 --> 04:31.619
What are you doing?

04:31.792 --> 04:35.208
One of Master Oogway's final teachings.

05:06.454 --> 05:07.486
Awesome!

05:07.664 --> 05:10.582
How did you do that?

05:10.751 --> 05:14.749
- Inner peace.
- Inner piece. That's cool.

05:15.673 --> 05:19.256
- Inner piece of what?
- It is the next phase of your training.

05:19.427 --> 05:25.263
Every master must find his path
to inner peace.

05:25.433 --> 05:29.597
Some choose to meditate for 50 years
in a cave just like this...

05:31.648 --> 05:34.768
...without the slightest taste
of food or water.

05:36.528 --> 05:37.608
Or?

05:37.780 --> 05:41.231
Some find it through
pain and suffering, as I did.

05:41.409 --> 05:44.778
Po, the day you were chosen
as Dragon Warrior

05:44.954 --> 05:46.781
was the worst day of my life.

05:47.665 --> 05:50.204
By far.
Nothing else came close.

05:50.377 --> 05:54.754
It was the worst, most painful,
mind-destroying, horrible moment...

05:54.923 --> 05:57.379
- OK.
...I have ever experienced.

06:01.389 --> 06:05.469
But once I realised the problem
was not you, but within me,

06:05.643 --> 06:11.230
I found inner peace and was able
to harness the flow of the universe.

06:11.399 --> 06:13.937
So that's it? I just need inner peace?

06:14.111 --> 06:16.234
My innards are
already super, super peaceful,

06:16.405 --> 06:19.821
so all I need to do
is just get this thing going.

06:19.992 --> 06:21.949
Inner peace, you're going down.

06:22.119 --> 06:23.911
Now show me what you were
doing there with your feet.

06:24.080 --> 06:25.159
I saw you do sort of a fancy foot...

06:25.331 --> 06:28.332
Po! Bandits!
Approaching the Musicians Village.

06:28.501 --> 06:29.580
Danger.

06:29.752 --> 06:33.667
Tell those musicians to start playing
some action music because it is on.

06:33.840 --> 06:36.212
Don't worry, Shifu, I'll master
inner peace as soon as I get back.

06:36.384 --> 06:38.009
No snack stops this time.

06:39.012 --> 06:40.886
Snack stops.

06:41.056 --> 06:42.764
Wait, are you serious?

06:55.321 --> 06:57.398
Get all the metal you can find!

07:01.453 --> 07:02.734
Grab the metal!

07:08.335 --> 07:10.577
Help, help, help, help. Help!

07:13.800 --> 07:16.042
That's everything!
Let's get out of here.

07:17.220 --> 07:18.335
Oh, no.

07:23.685 --> 07:25.678
Wings of Justice!

07:44.666 --> 07:45.864
The Dragon Warrior!

07:46.043 --> 07:48.332
A panda? That's impossible.

07:48.504 --> 07:50.413
My fist hungers for justice.

07:51.632 --> 07:53.292
That was my... fist.

07:53.467 --> 07:55.793
- Get 'em!
- Come on!

08:19.036 --> 08:20.365
Take that!

08:30.757 --> 08:32.381
Po! Incoming!

08:32.551 --> 08:34.378
Thanks, Mantis!

08:52.823 --> 08:54.650
Tigress, Double Death Strike!

09:03.459 --> 09:04.490
Feet of Fury!

09:09.049 --> 09:11.337
Tigress! Monkey!

09:11.509 --> 09:13.467
Viper! Mantis!

09:13.637 --> 09:15.464
Bunny! What?

09:16.348 --> 09:17.463
Oh, sorry.

09:23.522 --> 09:24.554
Help!

09:25.691 --> 09:27.649
- Crane, go!
- I'm on it!

09:46.797 --> 09:48.375
Is everyone OK?

09:48.925 --> 09:50.964
That was awesome!

09:53.722 --> 09:54.753
I got this.

10:06.068 --> 10:07.349
Po!

10:13.618 --> 10:15.160
Chew on that, tubby!

10:21.293 --> 10:22.668
Help.

10:24.755 --> 10:27.080
- Sweetie, are you OK?
- What happened?

10:28.717 --> 10:30.426
I think I saw...

10:30.594 --> 10:32.920
I think...

10:33.097 --> 10:34.508
I gotta go.

10:36.851 --> 10:42.094
Thank you. Thank you for coming
to Dragon Warrior Noodles and Tofu.

10:42.274 --> 10:44.017
- More tea? Lemon sauce?
- No.

10:44.192 --> 10:46.944
If you need anything, just ask.

10:47.863 --> 10:50.817
- Thank you.
- Feet of Fury!

10:50.991 --> 10:55.452
The Dragon Warrior's mop.
He mopped these very floors!

10:56.080 --> 10:58.951
No touching!
You'll get the mop dirty.

10:59.584 --> 11:01.458
- He once waited on me.
- Awesome!

11:01.628 --> 11:05.542
Yeah, I have the stain to prove it.
Hey, where is the Dragon Warrior?

11:05.716 --> 11:08.041
He doesn't work here any more.

11:08.218 --> 11:11.718
He's busy out there
protecting the Valley.

11:11.889 --> 11:13.383
- The Dragon Warrior!
- There he is.

11:13.557 --> 11:14.589
Po!

11:16.727 --> 11:19.219
- Here. OK. Nice kid.
- The Dragon Warrior!

11:19.397 --> 11:21.639
- Should've told me you were coming.
- Hi, Dad.

11:21.816 --> 11:24.058
I would have saved you
some stinky tofu.

11:25.737 --> 11:28.738
- Dad, can I talk to you?
- Of course, son.

11:29.491 --> 11:35.078
In honour of my son,
free tofu dessert for everybody!

11:35.247 --> 11:37.121
With purchases.

11:37.291 --> 11:40.910
Oh, it's so good to see you, Po.

11:41.087 --> 11:44.705
Have you lost weight? I can
almost put my wings around you.

11:44.883 --> 11:46.543
Ah, well, maybe a little.

11:46.718 --> 11:50.550
Poor you, you must feel weak.
Let me get you some soup.

11:50.722 --> 11:52.300
No, that's OK, Dad.
I'm not hungry.

11:52.474 --> 11:55.144
Not hungry?
Po, are you all right?

11:55.311 --> 11:57.268
Yeah. No, I'm fine. I just...

11:57.438 --> 11:59.763
Earlier today,
I was fighting these bandits.

11:59.940 --> 12:03.191
Nothing too dangerous.
I mean, they were just, you know...

12:03.361 --> 12:06.315
- Yeah?
- And then the strangest thing happened.

12:06.489 --> 12:08.197
I had this crazy vision.

12:08.366 --> 12:12.150
I think I saw my mom and me,
as a baby.

12:12.663 --> 12:14.951
Mom? A baby?

12:15.123 --> 12:18.493
- Dad?
- What...?

12:19.628 --> 12:21.668
How do I say this?

12:23.174 --> 12:25.167
Where did I come from?

12:29.055 --> 12:34.845
Well, you see, son,
baby geese come from a little egg.

12:35.228 --> 12:39.689
- Don't ask where the egg comes from.
- Dad, that's not what I meant.

12:41.026 --> 12:43.066
I know it's not.

12:43.237 --> 12:48.528
I think it's time I told you something
I should have told you a long time ago.

12:49.327 --> 12:50.490
OK.

12:50.662 --> 12:54.494
You might have been kind of a...

12:58.003 --> 12:59.663
...adopted.

12:59.838 --> 13:01.665
- I knew it.
- You knew?

13:01.840 --> 13:04.795
- Well, who told you?
- No one. I mean, come on, Dad.

13:04.969 --> 13:07.804
But if you knew,
why didn't you ever say anything?

13:07.972 --> 13:09.846
Why didn't you say anything?

13:12.185 --> 13:14.854
How did I get here, Dad?
Where did I come from?

13:16.565 --> 13:20.016
Actually... you came from this.

13:23.947 --> 13:26.783
It was just another day
at the restaurant.

13:26.951 --> 13:28.575
Time to make the noodles.

13:29.370 --> 13:33.866
<i>I went out to the back, where my
vegetables had just been delivered.</i>

13:34.042 --> 13:36.747
<i>There were cabbages, turnips, radishes.</i>

13:37.921 --> 13:40.542
<i>Only there were no radishes.</i>

13:40.715 --> 13:44.132
<i>Just a very hungry baby panda.</i>

13:46.972 --> 13:48.716
<i>There was no note.</i>

13:48.891 --> 13:50.931
<i>Of course, you could have eaten it.</i>

13:51.102 --> 13:56.097
<i>I waited for someone to come
looking for you, but no one did.</i>

14:20.091 --> 14:22.084
<i>I brought you inside.</i>

14:24.346 --> 14:25.970
<i>Fed you.</i>

14:27.641 --> 14:29.135
<i>Gave you a bath.</i>

14:32.146 --> 14:34.139
<i>And fed you again.</i>

14:36.609 --> 14:38.234
<i>And again.</i>

14:40.446 --> 14:43.116
<i>And tried to put some pants on you.</i>

14:51.708 --> 14:55.659
<i>And then I made a decision
that would change my life forever.</i>

14:57.840 --> 15:00.960
<i>To make my soup without radishes.</i>

15:01.135 --> 15:05.382
<i>And to raise you as my own son.</i>

15:05.557 --> 15:09.768
<i>Xiao Po, my little panda.</i>

15:10.979 --> 15:15.309
<i>And from that moment on,
both my soup and my life</i>

15:15.484 --> 15:17.643
have been that much sweeter.

15:18.696 --> 15:21.816
And, little Po,
that's the end of the story.

15:23.159 --> 15:26.160
Look at me. No, don't look at me.

15:26.329 --> 15:30.825
That's it? That can't be it.
There's gotta be more, Dad!

15:31.001 --> 15:35.212
Well, there was the time
you ate all my bamboo furniture.

15:35.380 --> 15:37.373
It was imported, too.

15:37.966 --> 15:40.718
One dumpling, please,
Dragon Warrior size.

15:46.059 --> 15:49.926
Oh, Po, your story may not
have such a happy beginning,

15:50.230 --> 15:51.605
but look how it turned out.

15:51.773 --> 15:55.522
You got me, you got kung fu,
and you got noodles.

15:55.694 --> 15:58.363
I know. I just have so many questions.

15:58.530 --> 16:00.938
Like how did I ever fit
in this tiny basket?

16:01.116 --> 16:02.776
Why didn't I like pants?

16:05.121 --> 16:07.113
And who am I?

16:14.255 --> 16:16.213
Good. Watch your form.

16:18.927 --> 16:20.386
Good.

16:21.972 --> 16:24.759
Better. Elbow.

16:24.934 --> 16:26.926
Straighten it out!

16:52.713 --> 16:54.920
Shen?

16:55.091 --> 16:58.045
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

16:58.219 --> 17:02.965
Now we've got the pleasantries
out of the way, please leave my house.

17:03.141 --> 17:05.263
- Your house?
- Yes.

17:05.435 --> 17:07.926
Didn't you see the peacock
on the front door?

17:09.898 --> 17:12.057
There you are, Soothsayer.

17:12.652 --> 17:17.396
It seems your fortune-telling skills
are not as good as you thought.

17:17.574 --> 17:21.571
- We shall see, Shen.
- No, you shall see, old goat.

17:21.744 --> 17:24.282
- Where were we?
- What do you want, Shen?

17:24.455 --> 17:28.952
What is rightfully mine. Gongmen City!

17:29.128 --> 17:31.797
Gongmen is under the stewardship
of the Masters' Council,

17:31.964 --> 17:35.796
and we will protect it. Even from you.

17:36.969 --> 17:40.220
I'm so glad you feel that way.

17:40.390 --> 17:43.225
Otherwise, I'd have dragged
that here for nothing.

17:43.393 --> 17:45.433
What's in the box, Shen?

17:45.604 --> 17:49.139
You want to see? It's a gift.

17:49.316 --> 17:53.100
It's your parting gift,
in that it will part you.

17:53.279 --> 17:54.821
Part of you here, part of you there

17:54.989 --> 17:58.939
and part of you way over there,
staining the wall!

17:59.118 --> 18:01.111
You insolent fool!

18:18.848 --> 18:21.635
- Show-off.
- That is a warning.

18:21.809 --> 18:24.645
You are no match for our kung fu.

18:24.812 --> 18:26.770
I agree.

18:26.940 --> 18:28.648
But this is.

18:42.623 --> 18:45.375
Are you familiar
with the master of Gongmen City?

18:45.543 --> 18:46.872
- Master Thundering Rhino?
- Yes.

18:47.045 --> 18:49.618
- Son of legendary Flying Rhino?
- Yes.

18:49.798 --> 18:52.752
And slayer of the Ten Thousand
Serpents in the Valley of Woe?

18:52.926 --> 18:54.966
- He's dead.
- Whoa.

18:55.137 --> 18:56.335
That's impossible.

18:56.513 --> 18:58.969
Rhino's Horn Defence
is impervious to any technique.

18:59.141 --> 19:02.641
It was no technique.
Lord Shen has created a weapon,

19:02.812 --> 19:05.219
one that breathes fire and spits metal.

19:05.857 --> 19:10.733
Unless he is stopped,
this could be the end of kung fu.

19:11.404 --> 19:15.272
- But I just got kung fu!
- And now you must save it.

19:15.450 --> 19:19.365
Go! Destroy this weapon
and bring Lord Shen to justice!

19:19.538 --> 19:21.365
OK, here we go! Here we go!

19:22.625 --> 19:25.246
Wait a second.
How can I do this?

19:25.419 --> 19:28.041
I mean, how can kung fu stop
something that stops kung fu?

19:28.214 --> 19:30.123
Remember, Dragon Warrior,

19:30.299 --> 19:33.669
anything is possible
when you have inner peace.

19:39.393 --> 19:42.098
Inner peace. Inner peace. Inner peace.

19:42.938 --> 19:44.017
Peace on.

19:44.189 --> 19:46.229
- Oh, Po?
- Peace!

19:46.400 --> 19:48.523
Oh, Po, I got you a travel pack.

19:48.694 --> 19:51.779
I packed you food for weeks.
Cookies, buns, vegetables.

19:51.948 --> 19:55.198
And I even packed
all your action figures. See?

19:58.288 --> 20:01.574
I don't know what those are.
Never seen them before in my life.

20:01.750 --> 20:03.624
Dad, you got scratches on my Tigress.

20:03.794 --> 20:06.665
I also packed your paintings
of our best time together,

20:06.839 --> 20:09.377
just in case you get lonely.

20:09.550 --> 20:13.382
That's me and you making noodles.
And that's me and you eating noodles.

20:13.554 --> 20:15.962
And that's me giving you
a piggyback ride.

20:17.433 --> 20:20.388
That cute? On second thought,
I'll hang on to this one.

20:20.562 --> 20:24.430
- Hey, they're waiting for me.
- Of course, of course.

20:24.608 --> 20:27.775
You have a job to do... far from home,

20:27.945 --> 20:31.646
in a strange city, filled with
strange people, and strange noodles,

20:31.824 --> 20:35.573
facing horrible danger
from which you might never return!

20:35.745 --> 20:38.318
- Don't go, Po!
- I gotta go.

20:38.498 --> 20:41.784
I'm the Dragon Warrior.
It's kind of my job to save kung fu.

20:41.960 --> 20:44.914
And if I don't... what am I?

20:45.088 --> 20:47.544
You're my son.

20:50.219 --> 20:51.333
Right?

20:52.680 --> 20:55.764
- Po, it's time.
- Goodbye.

20:57.852 --> 20:59.263
Don't worry, Mr. Ping.

20:59.437 --> 21:01.809
He'll be back before
you can say "noodles".

21:07.529 --> 21:09.522
Noodles.

21:15.996 --> 21:17.788
Come on, guys, let's go!

21:17.957 --> 21:19.155
Yeah!

21:21.961 --> 21:23.539
Yeah...

21:23.713 --> 21:26.465
Yeah, yeah. Yeah...

22:46.052 --> 22:47.297
Mama?

22:52.767 --> 22:55.602
Mom? Dad? Is that you?

22:55.770 --> 22:58.096
Mom! Dad!

22:59.983 --> 23:02.355
Oh, hi. Hey, son. You're back.

23:03.987 --> 23:05.814
Honey, what are you doing here?

23:05.990 --> 23:07.021
But I thought...

23:07.199 --> 23:10.117
We replaced you, dear,
with this lovely radish.

23:11.204 --> 23:14.324
- Radish?
- It's quiet, polite, and, frankly,

23:14.499 --> 23:16.373
does better kung fu.

23:17.043 --> 23:18.751
No. No, no, no.

23:22.799 --> 23:23.831
Wait!

23:30.057 --> 23:31.088
No.

23:39.651 --> 23:42.320
Radish, radish, radish, radish.

23:50.871 --> 23:52.698
Inner pea...

23:55.501 --> 23:56.580
Pea...

23:59.047 --> 24:00.624
Inner peace.

24:16.983 --> 24:21.811
Inner peace! Inner peace! Inner peace!
Inner peace! Inner peace...!

24:27.744 --> 24:29.737
I'm... training.

24:29.913 --> 24:32.202
The mast is not a worthy opponent.

24:35.920 --> 24:38.245
- I am ready.
- OK.

24:38.422 --> 24:40.415
So serious.

24:48.141 --> 24:50.217
I think I prefer the mast.

24:50.393 --> 24:55.103
Apologies. I used to punch the
ironwood trees by the palace to train.

24:55.274 --> 24:56.602
Now I feel nothing.

24:57.610 --> 24:59.649
That's severely cool.

25:02.573 --> 25:03.605
Again!

25:06.119 --> 25:10.532
So, this punching ironwood trees,
how long did you have to do that?

25:10.707 --> 25:13.459
- Twenty years.
- Oh, 20, 20 years.

25:14.378 --> 25:16.620
Is there any, you know, faster way?

25:16.797 --> 25:19.502
You know, until you, you know,
don't feel anything?

25:19.675 --> 25:21.632
No. Besides...

25:25.640 --> 25:28.641
...I don't think
hard style is your thing.

25:33.148 --> 25:35.769
Po, why are you really out here?

25:37.110 --> 25:40.480
I just found out that my dad
isn't really my dad.

25:42.575 --> 25:44.366
Your dad? The goose.

25:46.996 --> 25:49.238
That must have been quite a shock.

25:49.415 --> 25:50.791
Yeah.

25:50.959 --> 25:54.328
- And this bothers you?
- Are you kidding me?

25:54.504 --> 25:57.505
We're warriors, right?
Nerves of steel.

25:57.674 --> 25:59.631
Souls of platinum.

25:59.801 --> 26:01.000
Like you.

26:01.178 --> 26:03.135
So hard-core, you don't feel anything.

26:07.643 --> 26:09.683
- I was...
- So, what are you guys talking about?

26:10.605 --> 26:12.348
Nothing. Nothing.

26:12.523 --> 26:14.647
Po's having daddy issues.

26:14.818 --> 26:17.938
I'm so lucky.
I don't have any problems with my dad.

26:18.113 --> 26:20.485
Maybe it's because Mom
ate his head before I was born.

26:20.657 --> 26:23.492
- I don't know.
- Mantis, this isn't about you.

26:23.660 --> 26:25.700
Po is the one freaking out.

26:25.871 --> 26:28.030
- I'm not freaking out.
- Po.

26:28.207 --> 26:30.413
- I'm freaking in.
- Po!

26:30.584 --> 26:33.254
- What?
- We're here.

26:33.421 --> 26:35.378
Gongmen City.

26:51.732 --> 26:54.270
My father's throne.

26:54.443 --> 26:57.480
He used to let me play here beside him,

26:57.655 --> 27:02.152
promising someday,
this throne would be mine.

27:06.999 --> 27:08.279
A little to the left.

27:08.459 --> 27:10.582
Oh, but it's so heavy, Master!

27:10.753 --> 27:14.038
Thirty years I've waited
for this moment.

27:14.215 --> 27:17.714
Everything must be exactly
how I envisioned it.

27:17.885 --> 27:21.586
And I envisioned it
a little to the left.

27:22.515 --> 27:23.796
Perfect!

27:23.975 --> 27:27.179
With the weapon by my si...
A little bit more.

27:29.356 --> 27:35.110
With the weapon by my side,
all of China will bow before me.

27:35.279 --> 27:36.939
We move out in three days,

27:37.114 --> 27:40.947
when the moon is full
and the tide is high.

27:42.620 --> 27:45.740
Now, you old goat,
why don't you tell me my...

27:45.915 --> 27:46.947
Fortune?

27:47.834 --> 27:50.835
Future. I was going to say future.

27:51.797 --> 27:55.380
Look into your bowl
and tell me what glory awaits.

27:57.094 --> 28:00.629
If you continue on your current path...

28:02.975 --> 28:06.973
...you will find yourself
at the bottom of the stairs.

28:09.608 --> 28:11.481
I see...

28:12.277 --> 28:14.270
I see...

28:15.030 --> 28:18.482
I see pain... and anger.

28:18.659 --> 28:21.660
How dare you!
That is the finest silk in the province!

28:21.829 --> 28:22.860
Followed by denial.

28:23.039 --> 28:25.660
This is not fortune-telling.
You're just saying

28:25.833 --> 28:27.826
- what's happening right...
- Now?

28:29.504 --> 28:32.173
The most important time is now.

28:33.425 --> 28:35.833
But if you really want
to see the future...

28:38.722 --> 28:40.382
Oh, what do you see?

28:46.314 --> 28:48.141
A peacock...

28:49.442 --> 28:53.522
...is defeated by a warrior
of black and white.

28:54.739 --> 28:56.732
Nothing has changed.

29:03.290 --> 29:05.828
That's impossible, and you know it.

29:06.002 --> 29:09.205
It is not impossible, and he knows it.

29:09.380 --> 29:10.661
Who?

29:10.840 --> 29:13.841
- Lord Shen! I saw a panda!
- A panda?

29:16.096 --> 29:18.385
A kung fu warrior.
It fought like a demon!

29:18.557 --> 29:20.181
Big and furry.

29:20.350 --> 29:23.517
Soft and squishy.
Kind of plush and cuddly.

29:24.104 --> 29:27.308
There are no more pandas.

29:27.483 --> 29:30.817
Even with his poor eyesight,
he can see the truth.

29:30.987 --> 29:33.857
Why is it that you cannot?

29:34.782 --> 29:37.902
Find this panda and bring him to me!

29:38.078 --> 29:39.821
Yes, sir!

29:39.996 --> 29:43.829
One panda lives.
That does not make you right.

29:44.001 --> 29:47.833
You're right.
Being right makes me right.

29:48.422 --> 29:52.372
Then I will kill him and make you wrong.

29:54.387 --> 29:56.380
Will you stop that!

30:08.569 --> 30:11.653
That must be Shen's palace
on the other side of the city.

30:11.822 --> 30:14.360
Great. We'll march into the tower
and proclaim,

30:14.533 --> 30:16.573
"We are the Dragon Warrior
and the Furious Five,

30:16.744 --> 30:18.737
and we are here
to bring you to justice"!

30:22.000 --> 30:24.835
What are you doing?
This place is crawling with wolves.

30:30.426 --> 30:32.917
Hey, isn't that the guy
who hammered you in the face?

30:36.390 --> 30:37.968
I do not like that guy.

30:38.142 --> 30:41.761
We need to get to that tower
without being spotted by those wolves.

30:41.938 --> 30:44.429
Got it. Stealth mode.

31:07.882 --> 31:10.089
- Get out of the way!
- Foiled again.

31:12.137 --> 31:13.929
Now, where'd those noodles go?

31:20.187 --> 31:22.264
Hello. I couldn't help but...

31:23.065 --> 31:25.354
Yeah, OK. Anyway, where was I?

31:26.319 --> 31:28.526
- Where's Po?
- How can we lose a guy that big?

31:32.409 --> 31:33.440
OK.

31:40.042 --> 31:41.951
Guys! Guys?

31:42.128 --> 31:43.836
- Hey, Po.
- What? Sorry.

31:44.005 --> 31:45.499
So that was stealth mode, huh?

31:45.673 --> 31:48.129
To be honest,
not one of my stronger modes.

31:48.301 --> 31:50.709
...gold in there, come on!

31:52.055 --> 31:53.335
This rice is raw!

31:53.515 --> 31:56.053
You stole all my metal pots
for Lord Shen!

31:56.226 --> 31:59.393
Either you cook my rice, or I cook you!

31:59.563 --> 32:02.315
- My apologies, but...
- Po, do something.

32:02.483 --> 32:04.974
How am I supposed to help her cook rice
without getting caught?

32:05.152 --> 32:07.192
- Wait, I have a better idea.
...two...

32:07.363 --> 32:08.561
...one.

32:08.740 --> 32:10.364
- Hey.
- Hey.

32:21.670 --> 32:24.078
We're here to liberate the city
and bring Shen to justice.

32:24.256 --> 32:25.964
- You will need help.
- Thank you, brave sheep,

32:26.133 --> 32:27.592
but it's too dangerous. I can't let you.

32:27.760 --> 32:30.927
Oh, no, not me.
It's not safe to speak here.

32:31.097 --> 32:32.556
Right.

32:34.934 --> 32:37.426
I'm talking about Masters Ox and Croc.

32:37.604 --> 32:40.973
They're in Gongmen Jail
on Black Dragon Alley.

32:41.149 --> 32:42.774
What? They're still alive?

32:42.943 --> 32:44.936
They must be in that jail
gathering intelligence,

32:45.112 --> 32:47.817
hatching a plot to use their
awesomeness to defeat the weapon!

32:47.990 --> 32:49.650
OK, let's go!

32:49.825 --> 32:52.910
- Thanks, sheep.
- Hey! Stop that costume!

32:53.079 --> 32:54.359
- Hold it right there!
- Get them!

32:55.039 --> 32:56.783
- Get them!
- Sorry!

32:57.625 --> 32:59.120
Take that!

32:59.294 --> 33:00.872
- Keep going!
- Faster!

33:01.922 --> 33:02.953
Hey, stop!

33:23.153 --> 33:25.146
- Look out! Watch it!
- Sorry!

33:25.322 --> 33:26.401
Surround him.

33:28.826 --> 33:30.320
Now!

33:30.494 --> 33:32.238
Gotcha!

33:33.289 --> 33:34.534
What? Where'd he go?

33:34.707 --> 33:37.494
- Spread out! Search everywhere!
- What about over there?

33:37.668 --> 33:41.619
- Is "there" a part of "everywhere"?
- I... I guess.

33:41.798 --> 33:43.257
Then search there!

33:48.263 --> 33:51.679
They must be close. I can feel
a kung fu chill riding up my spine.

33:51.850 --> 33:53.843
Sorry, Po. It's just me.

33:55.020 --> 33:57.013
Look. Gongmen Jail.

34:00.651 --> 34:02.443
Aw, it's cute.

34:03.530 --> 34:04.905
Cute, huh?

34:14.166 --> 34:15.744
Nice work, Po.

34:17.210 --> 34:19.833
At the first sign of trouble,
I'll give you a signal.

34:21.382 --> 34:23.174
- You mean like Crane does?
- Yeah.

34:23.342 --> 34:25.715
Excuse me,
when have I ever made that noise?

34:26.554 --> 34:28.842
Master Ox! Master!

34:31.143 --> 34:32.553
The ferocious Master Croc!

34:34.521 --> 34:36.893
And Master Storming Ox.

34:37.942 --> 34:40.728
I can't believe we're rescuing
actual legends of kung fu.

34:40.902 --> 34:42.896
We're gonna free you from those
bonds of injustice. No problem.

34:43.072 --> 34:45.694
Gotta be a key around here. No,
they wouldn't leave a key around here.

34:47.118 --> 34:49.953
Oh, good! You found it.
Come on, you guys! Yeah!

34:50.121 --> 34:52.114
We're coming for you, Shen!

34:57.713 --> 35:00.833
Guys, are we going or not?
Do you want to meet us there later?

35:01.008 --> 35:02.752
I mean, you do want to
take back your city, right?

35:02.927 --> 35:04.635
Of course we do.

35:04.804 --> 35:08.636
But if we stand up to Shen,
he will turn the weapon on the city.

35:08.808 --> 35:10.600
Listen to yourself.
You're protecting Gongmen City

35:10.769 --> 35:12.560
by not protecting Gongmen City?

35:12.729 --> 35:17.356
- If we all fight together...
- Then the weapon would kill everyone.

35:17.526 --> 35:21.275
Oh, would it?
Then we use... a sneak attack!

35:21.447 --> 35:24.020
- We get inside and then...
- And then you will be stopped...

35:27.119 --> 35:28.780
...by the unstoppable weapon.

35:28.955 --> 35:31.280
Nothing's unstoppable except for me
when I'm stopping you

35:31.457 --> 35:33.949
from telling me
something's unstoppable!

35:44.430 --> 35:47.182
Master Ox,
I'm not letting you stay in this cell.

35:47.349 --> 35:49.223
I'd like to see you get me out!

35:54.816 --> 35:57.188
You guys see that?
It's called being awesome.

35:57.360 --> 35:59.234
Come on! Whatever
happened to being heroes?

35:59.404 --> 36:02.156
The only hero in this town
is a dead one!

36:06.745 --> 36:10.446
Like I said, you are not
getting me out of this cell!

36:13.211 --> 36:14.919
Yes!

36:15.088 --> 36:17.080
All right, let's go!

36:17.924 --> 36:19.169
I get the top bunk.

36:21.344 --> 36:25.508
It's time to surrender, panda.
Kung fu is dead.

36:25.682 --> 36:27.177
I...

36:30.312 --> 36:31.392
You...

36:31.564 --> 36:34.731
Kung fu is dead? Fine!

36:34.901 --> 36:38.352
You stay in your prison of fear
with bars made of hopelessness.

36:38.529 --> 36:41.733
And all you get are three
square meals a day of shame!

36:41.908 --> 36:43.533
With despair for dessert.

36:43.702 --> 36:46.869
We'll take on Shen and prove
to all those who are hungry

36:47.039 --> 36:50.953
for justice and honour
that kung fu still lives!

36:51.126 --> 36:52.502
Yeah!

36:55.631 --> 36:56.746
Monkey?!

36:58.301 --> 36:59.629
You! You're mine!

36:59.802 --> 37:01.760
I'll tell you what's gonna be yours!

37:01.930 --> 37:04.847
My fist in your plush, cuddly,
super-soft face!

37:07.477 --> 37:08.888
Get him!

37:09.438 --> 37:11.146
- Get me out of here!
- Yes, sir!

37:11.982 --> 37:13.358
Stop him!

37:16.362 --> 37:17.642
Faster!

37:20.742 --> 37:23.233
Yeah! Go, go!

37:23.870 --> 37:25.910
- Lose him!
- Yes, sir!

37:27.916 --> 37:29.909
- Viper!
- Hang on!

37:39.345 --> 37:42.097
- What?
- Watch out!

37:44.684 --> 37:46.760
Uncool! Very uncool!

37:47.145 --> 37:48.853
Try this!

37:50.106 --> 37:51.269
Guys, guys, guys!

37:56.530 --> 37:58.108
Maybe something smaller!

37:58.657 --> 38:00.780
No, no! Oh, no, no.

38:05.331 --> 38:08.083
Cute bunnies, off the face.
Excuse me! OK, pardon me!

38:17.719 --> 38:19.428
Fire!

38:20.097 --> 38:21.639
We've lost them.

38:30.650 --> 38:32.607
Again! Again!

38:33.737 --> 38:34.982
Crane, catch!

38:38.450 --> 38:39.481
Gotcha!

38:48.794 --> 38:50.787
Guys, guys, guys, guys,
give me a shove!

38:51.547 --> 38:53.505
Mantis, now!

39:06.939 --> 39:10.771
Is that all you got? It feels like
I'm fighting a big old fluffy cloud!

39:10.943 --> 39:13.185
Well, this cloud is about
to bring the thunder!

39:16.407 --> 39:17.522
Your turn!

39:19.661 --> 39:23.196
Why... are... there...
so... many... signs?!

39:39.015 --> 39:41.341
Come here! Alaka-squasho!

39:42.644 --> 39:46.013
Yes! Taste the defeat!

39:46.189 --> 39:47.565
Let me tell you something.

39:47.733 --> 39:50.734
Next time you mess with a panda,
you better bring a whole a...

40:00.538 --> 40:02.330
Guess nobody told you,

40:02.499 --> 40:05.416
if you mess with the wolf,
you get the fangs.

40:05.919 --> 40:09.787
I've hit you twice.
What are you going to do now?

40:12.718 --> 40:14.627
We surrender!

40:18.182 --> 40:22.394
You can chain my body, but you will
never chain my... warrior spirit.

40:22.562 --> 40:25.053
- Hey, don't forget the little guy.
- Did you just call...?

40:25.231 --> 40:28.398
- Po, what are you doing?
- Trust me. I got a pl...

40:29.945 --> 40:32.946
No way. Eight-point acupressure cuffs?

40:33.115 --> 40:36.365
Just like the ones that held Tai Lung.
The more you move, the tighter they get.

40:37.119 --> 40:39.278
These are the best cuffs!

40:41.791 --> 40:44.460
Greetings, panda. At last we meet!

40:45.837 --> 40:47.664
No, no, no...

40:50.967 --> 40:54.965
We meet at last! Yes, that's it.

40:55.139 --> 40:57.630
Greetings, panda. We meet at...

40:59.143 --> 41:02.892
- You are afraid for a reason.
- I am not afraid.

41:03.064 --> 41:05.816
He is coming to me in chains.

41:05.984 --> 41:08.475
- If anyone should be afraid, it's...
- You.

41:11.740 --> 41:13.982
Don't even think about it.

41:27.340 --> 41:30.092
I hope this turns out better than
your plan to cook rice in your stomach

41:30.260 --> 41:32.585
by eating it raw
and then drinking boiling water.

41:32.762 --> 41:34.839
This plan's nothing like that plan.

41:35.015 --> 41:37.138
- How?
- 'Cause this one's going to work.

41:49.697 --> 41:51.690
Keep moving.

41:57.372 --> 41:59.946
Ah, my old enemy...

42:04.463 --> 42:06.539
...stairs.

42:34.871 --> 42:38.074
Thanks for carrying me
those last few flights. OK.

42:38.249 --> 42:40.657
I threw up a little bit
on the third floor.

42:40.836 --> 42:42.246
Someone might want to clean that up.

42:42.421 --> 42:45.090
Is there some sort of evil janitor
or something?

42:45.257 --> 42:46.835
Greetings, panda.

42:47.009 --> 42:49.334
- We meet at...
- Hey, how you doing?

42:51.055 --> 42:52.466
Hey.

42:52.640 --> 42:55.641
You've grown up bigger than I thought.

42:55.810 --> 42:58.515
Hey... enough with the poking around.

42:58.688 --> 43:01.440
Strong. Healthy.

43:01.608 --> 43:04.277
Look, I don't know who you are,
but please stand aside, sir.

43:04.444 --> 43:06.900
- That's a lady.
- Oh! Sorry.

43:07.072 --> 43:09.777
The beard threw me.
It's kind of misleading.

43:09.950 --> 43:13.035
- False advertising.
- Enough of this nonsense!

43:13.204 --> 43:14.864
Bring the prisoners to me.

43:15.039 --> 43:16.664
Sorry, ma'am. Get ready, guys.

43:16.833 --> 43:19.371
Keep your eyes peeled for the...
weapon!

43:23.798 --> 43:24.997
Sparrow kick!

43:27.052 --> 43:30.219
We did it! I just kung fu-ed it!
Did you guys see that? I was all like...

43:39.398 --> 43:42.649
Do you actually believe this is
the warrior destined to defeat me?

43:42.819 --> 43:45.986
I do not. I know he is.

43:47.282 --> 43:50.734
Oh, look at him.
A lifetime to plot his revenge

43:50.911 --> 43:54.410
- and he comes to me on his knees.
- What? A lifetime?

43:54.581 --> 43:55.827
I did not have a lifetime.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.957
We only heard about Master Rhino
a few days ago,

43:58.127 --> 44:02.836
- and we came to avenge him!
- You've come to avenge nothing else?

44:03.007 --> 44:05.498
Well, yeah.
All the pots and pans that you stole.

44:05.677 --> 44:08.084
- I'm gonna want those back.
- Nothing else?

44:08.263 --> 44:10.836
You probably did some other evil stuff
along the way. I don't know.

44:11.016 --> 44:13.139
- What else did you do?
- You don't know?

44:13.310 --> 44:15.552
Know what? What's so funny?

44:15.729 --> 44:18.849
The very thing
that you clearly do not know!

44:19.024 --> 44:22.939
OK, enough of these riddles!
Would you guys spill the beans?

44:23.112 --> 44:26.446
First, we come in and the weapon
is tiny. Surprise, it's big.

44:26.616 --> 44:29.617
And then the lady over here,
I think it's a guy, 'cause he's got...

44:30.954 --> 44:33.492
The only reason you are still alive

44:33.665 --> 44:38.458
is that I find your stupidity
mildly amusing.

44:38.629 --> 44:41.963
Well, thank you. But I find your
evilness extremely annoying.

44:42.133 --> 44:44.006
Who do you think you are, panda?

44:44.176 --> 44:46.881
Who do you think I am, peacock?

44:55.480 --> 44:57.639
Why are we laughing?

44:58.692 --> 44:59.855
Take aim.

45:11.539 --> 45:12.950
Fire.

45:17.087 --> 45:19.792
Well, light the... thing!

45:19.965 --> 45:21.590
I did!

45:26.347 --> 45:28.221
Fear the bug!

45:37.275 --> 45:38.734
Get the weapon!

45:40.737 --> 45:42.611
Tigress!

46:15.441 --> 46:16.852
You... You were there.

46:17.026 --> 46:19.980
Yes. Yes, I was.

46:27.829 --> 46:30.996
- You just let Shen get away!
- At least we destroyed the weapon.

46:35.630 --> 46:37.040
Fire!

46:40.009 --> 46:41.836
Oh. No, he's got way more.

46:48.185 --> 46:49.560
- My wing!
- Help, Po!

46:49.728 --> 46:51.139
Coming!

46:52.022 --> 46:54.430
- Watch out!
- Po!

46:57.737 --> 47:00.607
- Help me up!
- No. Get him down.

47:00.782 --> 47:02.324
Use the ropes.

47:11.209 --> 47:13.286
Run, run, little panda!

47:24.557 --> 47:27.642
- Po, come on. We need you to focus!
- I got it, I got it!

47:27.811 --> 47:29.435
Bring it down!

47:32.899 --> 47:35.188
- We're trapped!
- This way!

47:39.573 --> 47:41.068
Goodbye!

47:44.120 --> 47:45.448
Fire!

47:46.914 --> 47:48.325
Get back!

47:56.383 --> 47:58.376
The only way out is up.

47:59.094 --> 48:00.505
What?

48:11.524 --> 48:13.980
Follow me! Come on!

48:14.569 --> 48:15.898
Where are they going?

48:16.071 --> 48:18.906
- To the top!
- Come on! Keep going!

48:26.165 --> 48:27.707
Here we go!

48:46.395 --> 48:49.729
- You idiot!
- My nose!

48:49.899 --> 48:54.312
Call in the wolves! All of them!
I want them ready to move!

48:54.487 --> 48:58.106
The Year of the Peacock begins now!

48:58.283 --> 49:01.154
Right now?
'Cause it's the middle of the year,

49:01.328 --> 49:03.997
so you'd only get like
a half of the Year of the Peacock.

49:05.791 --> 49:08.911
And this is the Year, of course,
of the Peacock.

49:09.086 --> 49:11.079
Happy New Year, sir.

49:14.926 --> 49:19.173
Get the wolves ready.
We're loading the ships now.

49:19.347 --> 49:20.426
Now!

49:20.598 --> 49:22.508
Now, now, now, now, now!

49:22.684 --> 49:25.471
Move! Move, move, move, move!

49:41.871 --> 49:43.496
This way.

49:47.878 --> 49:49.705
Let's go.

49:55.052 --> 49:55.966
Oh, you!

49:56.303 --> 49:58.380
What did you do?
It's chaos up there.

49:58.556 --> 50:00.216
What happened to stopping Shen?

50:01.684 --> 50:03.309
Yeah.

50:04.729 --> 50:06.888
Guys, come on.
Give me a little credit.

50:07.065 --> 50:09.188
I meant for him to get away.

50:09.359 --> 50:12.313
'Cause... it was a trick. It was a plot.

50:12.488 --> 50:17.399
I was thinking...
I'll figure out his plot more.

50:18.077 --> 50:20.070
That makes no sense.

50:20.246 --> 50:21.906
What do you mean? Sure it does.

50:22.081 --> 50:25.415
Po, the truth.
You had Shen. What happened?

50:25.585 --> 50:27.625
What are you talking about?
I don't know what you're talking about.

50:27.796 --> 50:30.334
I... Yeah...
OK, he caught me off guard.

50:31.049 --> 50:32.294
The truth.

50:35.679 --> 50:39.428
Fine. They will keep you
far from danger.

50:39.600 --> 50:42.138
- Real far.
- What?

50:42.311 --> 50:44.434
You're staying here.

50:44.939 --> 50:47.347
Wait! I have to go ba...

50:52.739 --> 50:54.566
You're staying here!

50:55.117 --> 50:57.275
I'm going. And you can't stop me.

51:00.581 --> 51:02.823
OK. I wasn't ready that time.

51:03.000 --> 51:04.708
Guys? Don't.

51:04.877 --> 51:05.956
Ready.

51:06.587 --> 51:07.619
Look!

51:20.185 --> 51:21.561
Stay down.

51:23.189 --> 51:26.273
- I have to get to him.
- Then tell me why!

51:28.653 --> 51:30.978
He was there! OK?

51:31.155 --> 51:34.359
The peacock was there
the last time I saw my parents.

51:34.534 --> 51:38.153
He knows what happened.
Where I came from.

51:38.330 --> 51:40.786
Who I am.

51:44.336 --> 51:46.459
Look, I'm going.

51:47.089 --> 51:49.497
I have to know.

51:49.675 --> 51:51.715
The hard core can't understand.

51:51.886 --> 51:53.594
Tigress, no!

51:57.767 --> 51:59.760
The hard core do understand.

52:01.480 --> 52:04.101
But I can't watch my friend be killed.

52:05.526 --> 52:09.606
- We're going.
- Maybe you can't watch me be killed?

52:09.780 --> 52:12.698
- Stop being a wimp.
- And she's back.

52:14.369 --> 52:16.527
- No.
- Don't worry, kid.

52:16.704 --> 52:18.496
You're better off here.

52:28.050 --> 52:32.546
You were wrong, Soothsayer.
We sail to victory tonight.

52:33.389 --> 52:35.714
Your magic panda is clearly a fool.

52:35.892 --> 52:38.846
Are you certain it is the panda
who is a fool?

52:39.020 --> 52:41.392
You just destroyed
your ancestral home, Shen.

52:41.564 --> 52:46.903
A trivial sacrifice...
when all of China is my reward.

52:47.070 --> 52:49.526
Then will you finally be satisfied?

52:49.698 --> 52:53.910
Will the subjugation of the whole world
finally make you feel better?

52:54.453 --> 52:58.451
It's a start. I might also convert
the basement into a dungeon.

53:01.377 --> 53:04.082
The cup you choose to fill
has no bottom.

53:04.255 --> 53:07.257
It is time to stop this madness.

53:08.301 --> 53:10.211
Why on earth would I do that?

53:10.387 --> 53:12.594
So your parents can rest in peace.

53:13.432 --> 53:16.386
My parents hated me.

53:17.603 --> 53:20.474
Do you understand?

53:20.648 --> 53:26.023
They wronged me...
and I will make it right.

53:26.196 --> 53:27.476
They loved you.

53:27.656 --> 53:32.401
They loved you so much that
having to send you away killed them.

53:34.997 --> 53:40.786
The dead exist in the past...
and I must tend to the future.

53:45.633 --> 53:49.678
Set the soothsayer free.
She's no use to me.

53:49.846 --> 53:53.465
Goodbye, Shen.
I wish you happiness.

53:53.642 --> 53:56.347
Happiness must be taken.

53:57.980 --> 54:00.352
And I will take mine.

54:22.256 --> 54:25.008
- Hurry it up!
- Move it!

54:26.135 --> 54:29.255
If all of those weapons
leave the building, China will fall.

54:29.430 --> 54:33.725
- We bring down the building.
- Hey, guys. How about this?

54:36.354 --> 54:38.513
- This will work!
- All right, let's go.

54:38.690 --> 54:40.185
I can't feel my face.

54:55.667 --> 54:58.621
Did you hear him call it
Year of the Peacock?

54:58.795 --> 55:01.037
- Hey.
- Hey.

55:01.215 --> 55:02.757
OK. So, keep it cool.
Keep it cool. Keep it cool.

55:02.925 --> 55:05.332
You! Where are you going?

55:07.430 --> 55:10.881
On your feet! And wipe those
stupid grins off your faces.

55:24.323 --> 55:28.107
Move, you dogs!
Faster, faster! Load them all!

55:38.421 --> 55:40.414
Greetings, panda.

55:44.010 --> 55:47.012
- Tell me what happened that night.
- What night?

55:47.181 --> 55:50.182
- That night.
- Ah, that night.

55:50.351 --> 55:53.352
Yes! We're talking
about the same night, right?

55:54.272 --> 55:58.056
Yes, I was there. Yes. I watched
as your parents abandoned you.

55:58.234 --> 56:02.813
It's a terrible thing.
I believe it went something like this.

56:12.958 --> 56:14.417
Here's your New Year's gift.

56:14.585 --> 56:16.744
Hope you like it,
'cause you can't return it.

56:18.631 --> 56:21.003
Po? What's he doing here?

56:21.926 --> 56:23.171
Return it! Return it!

56:35.232 --> 56:37.770
Are you willing to die
to find the truth?

56:37.943 --> 56:41.526
You bet I am.
Although I'd prefer not to.

57:04.305 --> 57:06.013
We got them. Go!

57:27.747 --> 57:29.241
You looking for me?

57:36.256 --> 57:38.048
I said that too soon, didn't I?

57:46.475 --> 57:47.638
Po!

57:52.398 --> 57:53.941
Po, get away from him.

57:54.109 --> 57:56.066
I'll get up. Here we go.

57:58.864 --> 58:01.533
- No more running, Shen.
- So it seems.

58:01.700 --> 58:03.693
Now... answers.

58:03.869 --> 58:06.621
Oh, you want to know so badly.

58:07.248 --> 58:10.451
You think knowing will heal you, huh?

58:10.626 --> 58:14.671
Fill some crater in your soul?

58:14.839 --> 58:16.998
Well, here's your answer.

58:17.175 --> 58:20.260
Your parents didn't love you.

58:21.305 --> 58:23.178
But here...

58:23.348 --> 58:26.018
...let me heal you!

58:32.024 --> 58:33.816
No!

59:48.398 --> 59:50.889
Yeah, like you could make me drink that.

59:55.155 --> 59:59.403
If I wanted you dead,
I would have left you in that river.

59:59.577 --> 01:00:03.527
- Well, why save me?
- So you can fulfil your destiny.

01:00:03.706 --> 01:00:06.910
What are you talking about?
Where am I?

01:00:09.212 --> 01:00:10.754
What is this place?

01:00:10.922 --> 01:00:14.920
I'm surprised you remember so little.

01:00:15.093 --> 01:00:18.545
But you were so little when it happened.

01:00:23.853 --> 01:00:26.391
Perhaps you do remember.

01:00:26.564 --> 01:00:28.557
What? It's just a stupid nightmare.

01:00:28.733 --> 01:00:30.809
Nightmare? Or memory?

01:01:01.769 --> 01:01:04.390
This was a thriving village.

01:01:04.563 --> 01:01:08.098
Young Shen was in line
to rule Gongmen City.

01:01:08.276 --> 01:01:10.103
But he wanted more.

01:01:10.278 --> 01:01:16.032
I foretold that someone would stand
in his way. A panda.

01:01:16.201 --> 01:01:20.151
But I never could have foretold
what came next.

01:01:33.344 --> 01:01:34.755
Get them all!

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:44.806
Take our son and run away! Go!

01:01:58.371 --> 01:02:01.990
Stop fighting. Let it flow.

01:04:05.925 --> 01:04:10.005
Your story may not have
such a happy beginning,

01:04:10.179 --> 01:04:13.299
but that doesn't
make you who you are.

01:04:13.475 --> 01:04:16.013
It is the rest of your story.

01:04:16.853 --> 01:04:19.012
Who you choose to be.

01:04:51.182 --> 01:04:54.551
So, who are you, panda?

01:05:02.819 --> 01:05:04.230
I am Po.

01:05:06.031 --> 01:05:07.988
And I'm gonna need a hat.

01:05:17.418 --> 01:05:20.373
Such sad, sad faces.

01:05:20.964 --> 01:05:23.253
But now is a time only for joy.

01:05:23.425 --> 01:05:27.470
You are going to be part
of something beautiful.

01:05:29.723 --> 01:05:33.721
Once we reach the harbour,
in front of all the world,

01:05:33.894 --> 01:05:38.058
you and your precious kung fu will die.

01:05:40.235 --> 01:05:45.146
Then China will know to bow before me.

01:05:45.323 --> 01:05:46.983
Set sail!

01:05:58.254 --> 01:05:59.665
What is that?

01:06:20.152 --> 01:06:23.319
Honestly, guys,
I never thought I'd die like this.

01:06:23.489 --> 01:06:26.491
I always thought I'd meet
a nice girl and settle down and...

01:06:26.659 --> 01:06:28.403
...then she'd eat my head.

01:06:28.578 --> 01:06:30.986
- So sad.
- We cannot give up hope.

01:06:31.164 --> 01:06:35.708
Po would want us to remain strong.
Hard-core. Right, Tigress?

01:06:43.678 --> 01:06:47.628
- Lord Shen, what about the bridge?
- Nothing stands in my way.

01:06:48.349 --> 01:06:49.548
Fire!

01:06:58.819 --> 01:07:00.646
You coward!

01:07:10.582 --> 01:07:11.661
Po?

01:07:14.085 --> 01:07:15.117
Po?

01:07:17.214 --> 01:07:22.339
How many times do I have to kill
the same stinking panda?

01:07:31.938 --> 01:07:33.349
Shen!

01:07:33.523 --> 01:07:37.568
A panda stands between you
and your destiny.

01:07:38.278 --> 01:07:39.309
What?

01:07:39.488 --> 01:07:43.486
Prepare yourself for a
hot serving of justice.

01:07:43.659 --> 01:07:45.319
Your reign of terror comes to an end.

01:07:45.494 --> 01:07:48.745
- What?
- And now, free the Five!

01:07:48.915 --> 01:07:50.991
Disc of Destruction!

01:08:02.095 --> 01:08:05.013
OK. Take aim!

01:08:16.319 --> 01:08:17.944
Ready?

01:08:38.885 --> 01:08:40.841
You can't follow me.

01:08:41.011 --> 01:08:42.091
Just get him!

01:08:47.394 --> 01:08:49.138
- Yeah. Here we go.
- Come on!

01:08:56.404 --> 01:08:57.779
- No, no, no, don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!

01:08:57.947 --> 01:08:58.978
No, don't shoot!

01:08:59.157 --> 01:09:01.564
- Don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!

01:09:01.743 --> 01:09:04.151
- You don't shoot!
- I won't shoot if you won't shoot.

01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:07.571
Yeah!

01:09:07.749 --> 01:09:10.620
- Don't shoot! Cross fire!
- Attack!

01:09:16.801 --> 01:09:19.256
- Catch of Freedom!
- Monkey!

01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:26.807
Impressive, Dragon Warrior.
What's your plan?

01:09:26.978 --> 01:09:29.136
- Step one, free the Five.
- What's step two?

01:09:29.314 --> 01:09:31.058
Honestly, I didn't think
I'd make it this far.

01:09:31.233 --> 01:09:32.264
Po!

01:09:32.442 --> 01:09:34.566
Stop Shen before he gets to the harbour.

01:09:40.117 --> 01:09:41.149
Nice!

01:09:43.746 --> 01:09:45.075
Viper, Puppet of Death!

01:09:45.790 --> 01:09:46.821
Tigress!

01:09:55.509 --> 01:09:57.502
- Master Ox!
- Jump!

01:09:57.678 --> 01:10:00.169
- And Croc!
- Vengeance is served.

01:10:00.347 --> 01:10:03.183
- Why did you...?
- Your friend there is very persuasive.

01:10:10.817 --> 01:10:12.015
Master Shifu!

01:10:14.362 --> 01:10:16.688
Quickly. Use their boats
to block the way.

01:10:27.502 --> 01:10:28.533
Crane!

01:10:29.504 --> 01:10:31.413
Wings of Justice!

01:10:33.508 --> 01:10:34.706
Yeah!

01:10:40.849 --> 01:10:41.881
What?

01:10:51.903 --> 01:10:55.983
I love you guys.

01:11:04.917 --> 01:11:06.577
Why aren't we firing?

01:11:06.752 --> 01:11:10.168
They're taking out our gunners, sir.
They're getting close.

01:11:11.966 --> 01:11:14.920
Fire! Fire at them!

01:11:15.595 --> 01:11:19.178
- But, sir, we'll kill our own.
- I said fire at them!

01:11:19.349 --> 01:11:20.380
Fire!

01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:24.051
No.

01:11:31.696 --> 01:11:32.976
Po!

01:12:08.569 --> 01:12:09.683
Tigress?

01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:01.248
As you wish.

01:13:01.417 --> 01:13:03.042
Let's finish this.

01:13:26.736 --> 01:13:27.934
Fire!

01:13:32.993 --> 01:13:34.820
<i>Inner peace.</i>

01:14:02.274 --> 01:14:03.305
Again!

01:14:10.616 --> 01:14:11.648
Yeah!

01:14:12.952 --> 01:14:15.906
Kill him! Somebody kill him!

01:14:38.104 --> 01:14:40.512
What? No. No!

01:14:47.156 --> 01:14:50.157
Keep firing! Keep firing!

01:15:10.806 --> 01:15:12.300
Skadoosh.

01:15:42.549 --> 01:15:43.877
How did you...?

01:15:45.301 --> 01:15:46.926
How did you do it?

01:15:50.766 --> 01:15:53.387
You know, you just keep your elbows up
and keep the shoulders loose.

01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:56.727
Not that. How did you find peace?

01:15:56.897 --> 01:16:00.563
I took away your parents. Everything.

01:16:00.735 --> 01:16:03.107
I scarred you for life.

01:16:03.738 --> 01:16:07.238
See, that's the thing, Shen.
Scars heal.

01:16:07.409 --> 01:16:11.407
No, they don't. Wounds heal.

01:16:11.580 --> 01:16:13.988
Oh, yeah. What do scars do?
They fade, I guess?

01:16:14.166 --> 01:16:18.579
- I don't care what scars do.
- You should, Shen.

01:16:18.754 --> 01:16:22.669
You gotta let go of that stuff from
the past, 'cause it just doesn't matter.

01:16:22.842 --> 01:16:27.338
The only thing that matters
is what you choose to be now.

01:16:27.514 --> 01:16:28.924
You're right.

01:16:29.099 --> 01:16:31.471
Then I choose... this!

01:17:24.283 --> 01:17:26.489
That was pretty hard-core.

01:17:35.837 --> 01:17:36.916
- Po!
- You did it!

01:17:37.088 --> 01:17:40.173
- Come here! Yeah!
- Don't ever do that again, please.

01:17:40.342 --> 01:17:44.007
It seems you have found inner peace.

01:17:44.179 --> 01:17:46.505
And at such a young age.

01:17:46.682 --> 01:17:48.556
Well, I had a pretty good teacher.

01:18:09.540 --> 01:18:13.205
What do you mean he's not here?
It's my son's birthday.

01:18:13.377 --> 01:18:15.750
All he wanted was to meet
the Dragon Warrior.

01:18:15.922 --> 01:18:18.674
How about some tofu birthday cake
instead, huh?

01:18:18.841 --> 01:18:21.677
You know, I think we'll
just try again another time.

01:18:21.845 --> 01:18:23.220
When do you think he'll be back?

01:18:26.183 --> 01:18:30.181
I don't know. OK, I don't know.
Maybe never.

01:18:30.354 --> 01:18:33.688
I mean, I worry, OK?
But that's my job, I'm his dad.

01:18:33.858 --> 01:18:36.064
At least, I was his dad.

01:18:36.235 --> 01:18:39.854
Why did he have to go and save China?
I know why.

01:18:40.031 --> 01:18:43.732
But why? He's just one little panda.

01:18:59.260 --> 01:19:03.044
So, how did it go?
Did you save China?

01:19:04.057 --> 01:19:05.432
Yep.

01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:07.889
Well, I knew you would.

01:19:08.061 --> 01:19:09.805
That's why I had new signs made.

01:19:09.980 --> 01:19:12.222
"My son saved China.
You, too, can save.

01:19:12.399 --> 01:19:14.890
Buy one dumpling, get one free."

01:19:15.069 --> 01:19:16.444
Hey, that's a pretty good deal.

01:19:16.612 --> 01:19:19.281
- Would you like to try one?
- Maybe later.

01:19:22.076 --> 01:19:24.152
There's something I should tell you.

01:19:26.956 --> 01:19:31.369
While I was gone,
I found the village where I was born.

01:19:33.088 --> 01:19:36.457
I found out how I ended up
in that radish basket.

01:19:36.633 --> 01:19:38.258
You did?

01:19:39.094 --> 01:19:43.009
- I know who I am.
- You do?

01:19:45.017 --> 01:19:46.642
I'm your son.

01:19:52.776 --> 01:19:54.400
I love you, Dad.

01:19:55.445 --> 01:19:57.319
I love you, too, son.

01:20:01.368 --> 01:20:03.408
Delicious, fat radishes!

01:20:03.579 --> 01:20:05.702
You're probably hungry.
Let me make you something to eat.

01:20:05.873 --> 01:20:07.617
What are you talking about? I'll cook.

01:20:07.792 --> 01:20:09.203
- No, no, I'll cook.
- Dad!

01:20:09.377 --> 01:20:11.500
Well, it's the least I can do.
You saved China.

01:20:11.671 --> 01:20:13.960
No, it's the least I can do.
You raised me.

01:20:14.132 --> 01:20:15.163
- Po.
- Dad.

01:20:15.342 --> 01:20:16.801
- Po!
- OK.

01:20:16.968 --> 01:20:19.590
Let's both cook. Together.

01:20:19.763 --> 01:20:21.044
Together.

01:20:21.223 --> 01:20:22.801
No, I'll cook.

01:20:57.721 --> 01:21:00.128
My son is alive.
