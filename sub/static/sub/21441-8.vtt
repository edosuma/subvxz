(GRUNTS)

00:13.883 --> 00:16.222
I work for serious people, Bob.

- APRIL: Where we're shooting.

00:18.160 --> 00:20.041
And Rick and Amara got
us a deal on local crew.

00:20.105 --> 00:22.105
So all that money goes to the screen!

00:23.105 --> 00:25.104
That's fucking brilliant.

00:25.168 --> 00:27.874
Bigger budget. You could lose money.

00:29.105 --> 00:30.100
I don't lose money.

Lady Margaret and I have been
acquainted since our infancy.

01:09.105 --> 01:13.099
I have long considered her a friend.

01:13.105 --> 01:16.099
Some say you consider
her more than that.

01:16.105 --> 01:19.286
Still others hint at a
history of impropriety.

01:19.437 --> 01:22.099
On your part and hers.

01:22.105 --> 01:25.105
The lady's virtue is beyond measure.

01:26.660 --> 01:27.793
Is it?

01:27.904 --> 01:33.099
I've taken the measure of many
ladies' virtue and come up short.

01:33.105 --> 01:36.099
I'm quite sure you do
not impugn the character

01:36.105 --> 01:40.099

01:40.105 --> 01:41.100

01:41.106 --> 01:44.105
Oh, I would be forced
to correct you, sir.

01:46.073 --> 01:48.105
Oh, my lady.

01:51.105 --> 01:54.099
Captain. I'd not expected
you back in Staffordshire

01:54.105 --> 01:57.099
for at least another fortnight.

01:57.105 --> 01:59.099
There's got to be a
better way of saying that.

01:59.105 --> 02:00.634
I mean, it's just a
bunch of words, isn't it?

02:00.714 --> 02:06.099

played out pretty nicely.

02:16.106 --> 02:18.099
Until I started vomiting narrative.

02:18.105 --> 02:21.099
Well, we did rehearse this many times.

02:21.105 --> 02:22.100
BECCA: It's not working.

02:22.106 --> 02:24.099
- Another line?
- Sounds like it.

02:24.105 --> 02:26.099
"Fortnight" doesn't roll off the tongue.

02:26.105 --> 02:28.099
Yesterday, she wouldn't say "agreeable."

02:28.105 --> 02:30.099
Okay, just give her a line, huh.

02:30.105 --> 02:32.099

you can jack a warehouse

Dairy hurts my stomach.

told you that. (SIGHS)

MILES: I mean, it's not just that
she won't follow the bloody script,

08:11.105 --> 08:14.099
I could live with that. But it's
that even when she does, she's shite!

08:14.105 --> 08:16.099
Yeah. Yeah, I mean it's weird.

08:16.105 --> 08:17.100
She was so good in that other movie.

08:17.106 --> 08:21.099
- The New Zealand prostitute.
- (GRUNTS) That was different.

08:21.105 --> 08:23.099
If she just would listen to Hafdis...

08:23.105 --> 08:24.100
Fat fucking chance.

08:24.106 --> 08:26.099
Excuse me? Is it reasonable to ask

08:26.105 --> 08:30.099
why the crafty and transpo
guys are packing heat?

08:30.105 --> 08:32.099
- Which ones?
- All the guys Amara brought on.

08:32.105 --> 08:34.105
Look! See?

08:34.655 --> 08:37.099
- Well, you know, Nevada...
- MILES: Oh, yeah.

08:37.105 --> 08:38.100
It's an open-carry state,

08:38.106 --> 08:40.099
so that's just part of the culture.

08:40.105 --> 08:43.099
Brandon will freak out if he sees
this. Liability issues alone...

08:43.105 --> 08:45.099
Uh, guys, I'm gonna have a little
chat with Miss Morgan, all right?

08:45.105 --> 08:47.099
Please, be my guest.

08:47.105 --> 08:48.100
It's all right. It's fine.

08:48.106 --> 08:50.105
- No, it's not.
- Yeah. I wish I had a gun.

09:03.462 --> 09:07.099
Dad, look. It's awesome, right?

09:07.105 --> 09:09.099
Yeah! Looks good.

09:09.105 --> 09:10.099
Uh, shouldn't you be in costume?

09:10.105 --> 09:11.100
Yeah, very funny.

09:11.106 --> 09:13.099
You think it's too much blush?

09:13.105 --> 09:15.099
- Hey, Annette.
- ANNETTE: Yeah?

09:15.105 --> 09:16.100
Could you tone down the blush a bit?

09:16.106 --> 09:19.099
Step back in the trailer
there, sweetheart.

09:19.105 --> 09:21.099
- She wouldn't eat breakfast.
- No, she's just nervous.

09:21.105 --> 09:23.099
I'll get her a yogurt or
something. She's almost late.

09:23.105 --> 09:25.099
Katie, you said she'd be on time.

09:25.105 --> 09:27.099
This is my fault? You sent
her back in for makeup.

09:27.105 --> 09:28.100
You wanted less blush.

09:28.106 --> 09:30.099
- (SCOFFS AND CHUCKLES)
- Fuck!

09:30.105 --> 09:32.099
- (CHUCKLES) It's fine.
- Great.

09:32.105 --> 09:35.099
It's fine. I'll have
the PA bring her to set.

09:35.105 --> 09:38.099
I... I didn't sleep last night.

09:38.105 --> 09:40.099
I'm more nervous than she is.

09:40.105 --> 09:42.099
She's gonna be great, okay?

09:42.105 --> 09:43.212
Wait, where are you going?

09:43.355 --> 09:46.099
I... I gotta smooth something
over. I'll see you in a bit.

09:46.105 --> 09:47.100

09:55.105 --> 09:57.099
- Hi!
- You okay?

09:57.105 --> 09:59.099
Yeah. The wind blew dust in my eye.

09:59.105 --> 10:02.105
Actually, can you, um, can you see
if there's anything still in there?

10:03.105 --> 10:05.099
Um...

10:05.105 --> 10:07.099
(CHUCKLES) You're not gonna
see anything from there, silly.

10:07.105 --> 10:08.105
(CLEARS THROAT)

10:10.105 --> 10:12.105
Uh...

10:14.105 --> 10:16.099
What is that? Is that
the inside of your skull?

10:16.105 --> 10:17.100
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

10:17.106 --> 10:20.099
You're funny.

10:20.105 --> 10:22.099
Uh, I just wanted to see
how you were settling in?

10:22.105 --> 10:23.519
Are you getting on okay
with the other actors?

10:23.614 --> 10:27.099
Yeah. I thought Max Kisbye would be
more fun, but he's in bed by 9:00.

10:27.105 --> 10:31.099
Oh! Well, I'll fire him and
find an actor who likes to party.

10:31.105 --> 10:33.099
(CHUCKLES)

10:33.105 --> 10:36.105
I saw your wife with
her luggage this morning.

10:37.105 --> 10:39.099
Is she heading back to L.A.?

10:39.105 --> 10:40.105
She is, yeah.

10:41.161 --> 10:46.105
Well, if you get bored, maybe we
could find something fun to do.

10:51.105 --> 10:54.105
- I'll bet we could.
- (CHUCKLES)

10:56.105 --> 10:59.099
- About that scene today.
- Yeah?

10:59.105 --> 11:02.099
- You're doing lovely work.
- Thank you.

11:02.105 --> 11:04.099
I'm not worried about you at all.

11:04.105 --> 11:10.099
But sometimes, it feels like everyone's
in a different movie, you know?

11:10.105 --> 11:12.099
- That's not good.
- No.

11:12.105 --> 11:14.099
I had a thought, though.

11:14.105 --> 11:16.756
I wonder if everyone just
did what was in the script

11:16.843 --> 11:21.105
and listened to the director, would
it feel like a more complete piece?

11:23.105 --> 11:25.099
(CHUCKLES)

11:25.105 --> 11:28.099
I'm so excited to be playing Margaret,

11:28.112 --> 11:30.440
- maybe I get carried away.
- (GRUNTS)

11:30.536 --> 11:33.099
But I know that this is a collaboration.

11:33.105 --> 11:35.105
So if I get out of line,

11:36.105 --> 11:38.105
just look me in the eye

11:40.105 --> 11:43.105
and say, "Becca."

11:43.779 --> 11:45.986
And I will snap out of it.

11:52.105 --> 11:54.099
Becca.

11:54.105 --> 11:56.105
Your wish is my command.

11:57.105 --> 11:59.099
Well, that sounds dangerous.

11:59.105 --> 12:01.105
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

12:02.105 --> 12:04.099
My daughter's about to do a scene.

12:04.105 --> 12:06.099
(SIGHS) You should go.

12:06.105 --> 12:08.099
Yeah.

12:08.105 --> 12:09.105
(CHUCKLES)

12:11.105 --> 12:13.099
I'll see you on set.

12:13.105 --> 12:15.099
Not if I see you first.

12:15.105 --> 12:16.105
(CHUCKLES) Good one.

12:21.105 --> 12:23.105
(CHUCKLES)

12:29.105 --> 12:33.099
Hope there's not a
long line at catering.

12:33.105 --> 12:35.099
You know, they keep saying that I
could cut in front of the extras,

12:35.105 --> 12:38.105
but I just don't wanna act all entitled.

12:41.105 --> 12:42.100
It's just, they... They run out of some

12:42.106 --> 12:45.105
of the entrees pretty fast, you know.

12:48.105 --> 12:50.105
(BABBLING)

12:53.787 --> 12:56.099
(GRUNTING)

12:56.105 --> 12:57.105
God damn it...

12:58.105 --> 13:01.105
Whoo! (CHUCKLES) We pop a tire?

13:02.105 --> 13:04.105
- (GUNSHOTS)
- Oh, my...

13:09.105 --> 13:10.100
(GRUNTS)

13:10.106 --> 13:13.105
(YELLS) It's hot! Hot! Hot!

13:14.105 --> 13:16.105
(NATHAN SHRIEKS)

13:17.105 --> 13:19.105
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

13:21.105 --> 13:23.099
- Thank you.
- MAN 1: Picture's up.

13:23.105 --> 13:24.105
RICK: Okay, here we go.

13:25.105 --> 13:26.100
WOMAN: Roll sound.

13:26.106 --> 13:28.105
MAN: Nineteen baker,
take one. A and B mark.

13:29.105 --> 13:30.100
MAN 2: Camera speed.

13:30.106 --> 13:32.099
WOMAN 2: Set.

13:32.105 --> 13:34.105
Ready, and action!

13:37.105 --> 13:38.105
They said you'd gone.

13:40.105 --> 13:45.099
Kitty, might I ask you to
deliver a letter before I leave?

13:45.105 --> 13:47.099
<i>To Lady Margaret?</i>

13:47.105 --> 13:49.105
<i>Aye, yes.</i>

13:50.105 --> 13:53.099
<i>Is it a secret letter?</i>

13:53.105 --> 13:55.272
MAX: <i>That will depend
on the lady's response.</i>

13:55.312 --> 13:57.100
EMMA: <i> Let me read it.</i>

13:57.106 --> 13:59.099
Got a problem.

13:59.105 --> 14:01.099
MAX: <i>Will you simply hold it
to the light of the candle?</i>

14:01.105 --> 14:04.097
EMMA: <i> I would steam it open with
a kettle. So as not to burn it.</i>

14:04.185 --> 14:06.100
MAX: <i>Well, I'll save you the trouble.</i>

14:06.106 --> 14:08.099
<i>It's a declaration of sorts.</i>

14:08.105 --> 14:10.099
<i>Of my great affections for her.</i>

14:10.105 --> 14:12.099
EMMA: <i> Course I know that.</i>

14:12.105 --> 14:14.099
HAFDIS: And, cut!

14:14.105 --> 14:16.099
- MAX: That was really nice. Well done.
- EMMA: Thank you.

14:16.105 --> 14:18.099
- HAFDIS: Let's do that again.
- (KATIE CHUCKLES)

14:18.105 --> 14:20.099
You notice my daughter's
in that fucking scene?

14:20.105 --> 14:21.100
(MUTTERS)

14:21.106 --> 14:24.105
WOMAN 3: Oh, do we have a
PA with this on his account?

14:28.105 --> 14:29.100
I'll be right back.

14:29.106 --> 14:31.099
You're leaving?

14:31.105 --> 14:34.105
I... I won't miss it. I'm just
gonna watch it from another monitor.

14:45.105 --> 14:47.099
Christ.

14:47.105 --> 14:49.099
- MILES: What's his name?
- ED: Big Mike.

14:49.105 --> 14:52.105
Well, were they shooting at
Mike, or were they shooting at us?

14:52.573 --> 14:54.186
Anyone go check?

14:54.376 --> 14:56.043
Or is there a sniper
behind a fucking sand

14:56.090 --> 14:57.717
dune somewhere, gonna
keep firing shots?

14:57.773 --> 14:59.100
We got guys clearing the area.

14:59.106 --> 15:00.126
Witnesses?

15:00.198 --> 15:03.372
Actor was in the van when
it happened. Lord Sheridan?

15:03.627 --> 15:05.621
Oh, fucking Nathan.

15:05.627 --> 15:09.621
We can't have Big Mike just
bleeding out here in broad daylight.

15:09.627 --> 15:10.622
Stick him into the producer's trailer.

15:10.628 --> 15:12.621
I'm gonna go and talk to the Lord.

15:12.627 --> 15:15.621
LOUIS: All right, Big Mike, you're
gonna live, but this is gonna hurt.

15:15.627 --> 15:16.627
(GRUNTS) Come on, Ed.

15:17.627 --> 15:18.622
(GRUNTS)

15:18.628 --> 15:20.621
(SHUDDERS)

15:20.627 --> 15:21.622
- (KNOCK AT DOOR)
- Yeah?

15:21.628 --> 15:23.627
(DOOR OPENS)

15:24.627 --> 15:26.621
Bit of excitement, huh?

15:26.627 --> 15:27.622
That was totally crazy.

15:27.628 --> 15:30.621
I mean, what the hell?
Someone was shooting at us.

15:30.627 --> 15:33.627
Shooting at you? Why
would anyone do that?

15:34.627 --> 15:36.621
I don't know why. But, like...

15:36.627 --> 15:39.621
No, no, no. (CHUCKLES)
That's funny. Sit down.

15:39.627 --> 15:40.622
(NATHAN GRUNTS)

15:40.628 --> 15:44.621
No, man. We're using historical
muskets for the battle sequence.

15:44.627 --> 15:46.621
Oh, wait till you see
them, they're beautiful.

15:46.627 --> 15:48.621
And the guys were doing
a test in the desert

15:48.627 --> 15:50.621
and they didn't see
the van coming until...

15:50.627 --> 15:52.621
- (IMITATES SHOOTING SOUNDS)
- No way.

15:52.627 --> 15:53.622
MILES: Yeah.

15:53.628 --> 15:57.621
Oh, the special effects
guy feels terrible.

15:57.627 --> 15:58.622
But the driver's gonna be fine,

15:58.628 --> 16:00.621
he's on his way to the
hospital to have a few stitches.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.621
Good. 'Cause he's a
really nice guy, too.

16:02.627 --> 16:03.627
Should...

16:05.627 --> 16:07.621
- Should we send him a card?
- Huh...

16:07.627 --> 16:10.621
I think it's probably better if
we just keep it between ourselves.

16:10.627 --> 16:11.622
Mmm-hmm. (SIGHS)

16:11.628 --> 16:13.621
Insurers can get a bit jumpy.

16:13.627 --> 16:15.621
It'd be terrible if they shut the movie
down and you couldn't play this great part.

16:15.627 --> 16:18.621
- Could that happen?
- Not if we keep it quiet.

16:18.627 --> 16:19.622
Whoa! (EXHALES DEEPLY)

16:19.628 --> 16:21.621
Did you get lunch, by the way?

16:21.627 --> 16:22.622
No, no, not yet.

16:22.628 --> 16:25.621
The guy was driving me to catering
when he got hit by a bullet.

16:25.627 --> 16:27.621
MILES: Oh.

16:27.627 --> 16:28.622
Why don't you run some of your lines,

16:28.628 --> 16:31.621
and I'll have a PA bring you some food.

16:31.627 --> 16:33.621
- Okay.
- I hear it's steak day.

16:33.627 --> 16:35.627
(CHUCKLES) Steak, that
sounds awesome. I love steak.

16:36.627 --> 16:37.627
(SIGHS)

16:39.627 --> 16:43.621
Hey, why did the van driver shoot back?

16:43.627 --> 16:44.622
What's that?

16:44.628 --> 16:47.627
The van got hit, and he pulled
out a gun and was like, bang, bang!

16:49.627 --> 16:52.621
Ex-marine, I heard.

16:52.627 --> 16:55.627
Probably a bit confused by all the fire.

16:57.627 --> 16:59.621
Also, Nevada's an open-carry state,

16:59.627 --> 17:01.627
so it's part of the culture, isn't it?

17:02.627 --> 17:03.622
Right.

17:03.628 --> 17:05.621
You're doing a great job on the movie.

17:05.627 --> 17:06.621
Everybody's talking about you.

17:06.627 --> 17:07.622
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:07.627 --> 17:10.621
Thanks. Um, I mean it feels...

17:10.627 --> 17:11.621
I'll let you keep working on it.

17:11.627 --> 17:12.627
Okay.

17:31.627 --> 17:33.621
AMARA: You got somebody angry at you?

17:33.627 --> 17:34.621
I don't think so.

17:34.627 --> 17:35.627
(DOOR OPENS)

17:40.627 --> 17:42.621
MILES: How long till we
can get him out of here?

17:42.627 --> 17:46.621
Guy's coming to patch him
up, then we'll move him.

17:46.627 --> 17:48.621
Want to fill me in on why
people are shooting at us?

17:48.627 --> 17:50.621
Someone don't like your movie.

17:50.627 --> 17:52.621
I only ask 'cause I'm trying
to protect Amara's investment

17:52.627 --> 17:55.621
and I didn't factor in the
possibility of fucking snipers.

17:55.627 --> 17:57.621
You're the reason why we're out
here sitting like ducks, bitch!

17:57.627 --> 17:58.627
- AMARA: <i> Callate.</i>
- Bullshit.

18:01.627 --> 18:04.621
Josias had friends and
family up around here.

18:04.627 --> 18:06.621
They weren't happy about what
happened at Indian Springs.

18:06.627 --> 18:09.621
Went to make a collection,
they were gonna jump my ass.

18:09.627 --> 18:14.621
So, in hindsight, maybe not
the best idea to film here

18:14.627 --> 18:16.621
if we knew it was gonna be a war zone.

18:16.627 --> 18:17.627
Thought it was under control.

18:20.627 --> 18:23.621
When you say "friends and
family of Josias", do, uh...

18:23.627 --> 18:25.621
Do we have actual names?

18:25.627 --> 18:30.621
No. And are they targeting
the movie, do you think?

18:30.627 --> 18:32.621
'Cause I got the head of
the studio coming tomorrow.

18:32.627 --> 18:33.622
It'd be lovely if he
didn't notice the crew

18:33.628 --> 18:35.627
was full of fucking bullet holes.

18:39.627 --> 18:44.621
Can you have your guys keep
watch while we're filming?

18:44.627 --> 18:46.621
Also at the production
office and the hotel?

18:46.627 --> 18:48.621
Oh, so you're gonna
tell her what to do now?

18:48.627 --> 18:49.627
I take care of it.

18:51.627 --> 18:52.627

19:07.627 --> 19:08.622
Hey, can't go in there.

19:08.628 --> 19:10.621
Uh, it's a producer's trailer.

19:10.627 --> 19:11.621
Here, remember me? Producer.

19:11.627 --> 19:12.622
Can't go in there right now.

19:12.628 --> 19:15.621
I gotta piss like a
fucking racehorse here.

19:15.627 --> 19:17.627
That honey wagon's
all the way down at...

19:18.627 --> 19:19.627
Jesus Christ!

19:23.627 --> 19:24.627
What happened to him?

19:26.627 --> 19:28.627

- Cutting.

19:48.627 --> 19:49.622
- Think we got it.

- Was I okay?
- Oh, you were wonderful.

20:01.627 --> 20:03.627

20:05.627 --> 20:06.958
Did you see it?

20:07.006 --> 20:10.621
Oh, was that you up there? I was
checking football scores on my phone.

20:10.627 --> 20:15.621
You were amazing. Oh
my God! So much sparkle.

- Yeah.

MILES: You made it look so easy.

20:21.628 --> 20:24.621
Well, the first time I was
trying to remember lines.

20:24.627 --> 20:26.621
But the second time, it was like
I was actually talking. (CHUCKLES)

20:26.627 --> 20:28.621
Oh, and I had to keep reminding myself

20:28.627 --> 20:29.622
that was our little girl up there.

20:29.628 --> 20:32.621
She's dressed up and talking
funny, but that's her.

20:32.627 --> 20:33.622
(KATIE CHUCKLES)

another scene next week.

- Hold on, hold on, hold on.
- Don't want it to be over.

- Safe flight.
- (SIGHS) Call you tonight.

20:49.627 --> 20:50.622
Cool.

20:50.628 --> 20:53.621
My interview's at four
tomorrow. With Doctor Seu...

20:53.627 --> 20:56.621
Doctor Seuss! Yes, I remember.

20:56.627 --> 20:58.627
Can't believe we'll be in
our new place without you.

But have a fantastic week of filming.

be easier for lights.

(SPITTING)

21:31.627 --> 21:33.621
Let's continue.

21:33.627 --> 21:34.622
You are a scoundrel, sir.

21:34.628 --> 21:36.621
One who is to share a
bed with you tomorrow.

21:36.627 --> 21:38.621
And grab her arm and kiss her.

21:38.627 --> 21:39.622
No, but that's what I'm saying!

21:39.628 --> 21:41.621
I don't let him actually kiss me.

21:41.627 --> 21:43.621
I mean, why would I do that?

21:43.627 --> 21:46.621
It's the point of the whole scene.

21:46.627 --> 21:48.621
You see, it says here,

21:48.627 --> 21:50.621
"He kisses her." Then
you have a line that says,

21:50.627 --> 21:52.621
"If you do that again, I shall scream."

21:52.627 --> 21:55.621
Yeah, but I don't let
him, I pull away, right?

21:55.627 --> 21:57.621
What if I didn't grab you,

21:57.627 --> 21:58.622
- would that help? Oh.
- Can I talk to the director?

21:58.628 --> 22:00.627
Okay. (GRUNTS)

22:01.627 --> 22:05.621
If you don't mind, the
whole idea with this movie...

22:05.627 --> 22:06.622
- Mmm-hmm.
- ...it's a period piece,

22:06.628 --> 22:08.621
- right?
- Right. Mmm-hmm.

22:08.627 --> 22:10.621
Back then, women didn't have much power.

22:10.627 --> 22:13.621
And that's your character's predicament.

22:13.627 --> 22:15.621
- You want to save your family.
- Mmm-hmm.

22:15.627 --> 22:17.621
- That's the tragedy.
- Okay.

22:17.627 --> 22:19.621
Yeah, got it. It's just...

22:19.627 --> 22:22.621
That's not a story that interests me.

22:22.627 --> 22:26.579
Well, now why the hell
did you take this part?

22:26.690 --> 22:29.621
You didn't hire me to just read
what's on the bloody page, okay?

22:29.627 --> 22:32.621
I am trying to inject
life into this thing.

22:32.627 --> 22:34.621
If he doesn't kiss her, the
scene doesn't make much sense.

22:34.627 --> 22:37.621
- Please, everybody jump in.
- MILES: Okay.

22:37.627 --> 22:39.621
Anyone else want to
share thoughts, yeah?

22:39.627 --> 22:44.109
Can I just say one thing? Becca...

22:44.299 --> 22:46.621
Jesus Christ, you can't
just touch me like that.

22:46.627 --> 22:47.622
- What?
- That is totally inappropriate.

22:47.628 --> 22:50.621
- There was no touching.
- Everyone saw you.

22:50.627 --> 22:53.621
Well, no, he didn't mean it that way.

22:53.627 --> 22:54.621
Now you're both ganging up on me.

22:54.627 --> 22:55.622

22:55.628 --> 22:57.621
I don't feel safe.

22:57.627 --> 23:00.621
You can just shoot this
fucking scene without me.

everyone. Let's take five.

23:02.627 --> 23:04.621

MAN: Yeah, take five,
everyone. Let's take a five.

23:06.627 --> 23:09.621
Please tell me she's not filing
a sexual harassment claim.

23:09.627 --> 23:11.621
There was no touching. Not
in the way that she means.

23:11.627 --> 23:16.621
Oh, this, this could have been
the best movie I ever made,

23:16.627 --> 23:18.621
and she just destroys everything.

23:18.627 --> 23:20.621
Maybe when it's cut together.

23:20.627 --> 23:21.622
No, are you watching
the same dailies as us?

23:26.627 --> 23:28.621
Can we get somebody else?

23:28.627 --> 23:31.621
Yeah, what about, uh, Carey Mulligan?

23:31.627 --> 23:34.621
I know her manager. She's
in my trampoline class.

23:34.627 --> 23:37.621
Okay, are we forgetting
that Becca's pay- or-play?

23:37.627 --> 23:40.621
Even if we fire her, we
gotta pay her full quote.

23:40.627 --> 23:42.621
There's no money for anybody else,

23:42.627 --> 23:44.621
unless Brandon wants to pay extra.

23:44.627 --> 23:45.622
That's not gonna happen.

23:45.628 --> 23:48.621
So, we're just gonna flush
the movie down the toilet?

23:48.627 --> 23:52.627
Now this is the real tragedy. (GRUNTS)

23:58.627 --> 24:00.621

you can't hide for long, out here,

And I swear on a Bible,
when I know, you'll know.

24:22.627 --> 24:25.621
You know, there's times I thought
what Josias' doing ain't right.

24:25.627 --> 24:27.621
Like when he leaned on you?

24:27.627 --> 24:29.621
Then I heard he was gone,

24:29.627 --> 24:33.627
and I thought, hey,<i>
amigo</i> had it coming.

24:34.627 --> 24:36.461
That's what you thought.

24:36.627 --> 24:39.621

never fucking believe her.

if he's got a high-powered

And I hate to say it but
that is a very bad idea.

28:14.627 --> 28:16.621
- Becca's famous.
- Yeah.

28:16.627 --> 28:19.621
The bad publicity would probably
shut the whole movie down.

47:19.369 --> 47:20.364
MILES: <i> Well, that's good.</i>

47:20.370 --> 47:25.363
So, now we're living in
L.A., and you're in Nevada.

47:25.369 --> 47:28.363
I was thinking I might stay here,
actually. I could move in with Jeffrey.

47:28.369 --> 47:31.363
You know what? On that note,
I'm dealing with the movers.

47:31.369 --> 47:34.363
<i>- Let's talk later.</i>
- Give Shorty a kick from me.

47:34.369 --> 47:37.363
And well done.

47:37.369 --> 47:42.363
I didn't even know you could get
a degree in "vocal performance."

47:42.369 --> 47:45.363
- (CHUCKLES)
- Well, there's no money in it.

47:45.369 --> 47:49.363
I had to pay off my student
loans somehow, so here I am.

47:49.369 --> 47:51.369
(CHUCKLES)

47:52.369 --> 47:54.363
Did you always want to be a writer?

47:54.369 --> 48:01.369
Uh... Well, I thought it would be
less stressful than my last job.

48:03.369 --> 48:05.369
I know, being on-set writer is a lot.

48:06.369 --> 48:08.369
But you're doing great.

48:10.369 --> 48:11.369
Thanks.

48:14.369 --> 48:17.369
(CHUCKLES) I'm gonna get
some water. You want some?

48:18.369 --> 48:20.369
No, thanks, I'm okay.

48:24.369 --> 48:26.363
Hey, for what it's worth,

48:26.369 --> 48:29.369
I would pay to hear you sing anytime.

48:37.369 --> 48:41.363

49:32.369 --> 49:33.369
(CHUCKLES)

49:35.369 --> 49:36.363
MAN 1: Pull!

49:36.369 --> 49:37.363
MAN 2: Fire!

49:37.369 --> 49:38.369
Fire!

49:39.369 --> 49:41.363
MAN 3: Reload!

49:41.369 --> 49:42.364
HAFDIS: Cut!

49:42.370 --> 49:44.363
- MAN 3: Oh, that's a cut!
- Perfect, guys!

49:44.369 --> 49:46.363
Gotta do it again.

49:46.369 --> 49:47.364
FIRST AD: Resetting, quickly, please.

49:47.370 --> 49:49.363
RICK: We don't need
to do it again but...

49:49.369 --> 49:51.363
LOUIS: Should've written more cannon
parts if I knew it was that cool.

49:51.369 --> 49:52.369
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

49:54.369 --> 49:57.363
I've got a call scheduled
with Becca's reps.

49:57.369 --> 49:59.363
You want to break the news to
Becca, or should we flip for it?

49:59.369 --> 50:01.369
Oh, no, I'll handle that.

50:03.369 --> 50:04.369
(CELL PHONE CHIMING)

50:06.369 --> 50:09.369
Quickly, we're shooting. What?

50:10.369 --> 50:11.364
We're ready to roll, guys,

50:11.370 --> 50:15.363
can you please put the
phones away and focus?

50:15.369 --> 50:18.363
Did you know we were getting shut down?

50:18.369 --> 50:20.363
- HAFDIS: Huh?
- It's on Deadline.

50:20.369 --> 50:22.363
What the hell are they talking about?

50:22.369 --> 50:24.363
Hold on, okay, here's Deadline.

50:24.369 --> 50:28.363
"Gravity International stops production
of <i> The Admiral's Mistress."</i>

50:28.369 --> 50:30.363
APRIL: Why am I hearing about this now?

50:30.369 --> 50:32.363
Who filed an accident report?

50:32.369 --> 50:35.363
Accident? Is this about the fire?

50:35.369 --> 50:37.363
No, no, hold on, the fire
didn't stop us shooting.

50:37.369 --> 50:40.363
Becca Morgan did not scratch her cornea!

50:40.369 --> 50:43.363
The speck of sand under
her fuckin' contact?

50:43.369 --> 50:44.364
She was fine!

50:44.370 --> 50:46.363
She shot a scene the same day.

50:46.369 --> 50:49.369
Marsha, have Brandon call me
the second his plane lands.

50:51.369 --> 50:52.364
That Kiwi cunt.

50:52.370 --> 50:54.363
She knew. She knew we
were getting rid of her,

50:54.369 --> 50:56.363
and she's trying to bring
the whole thing down.

50:56.369 --> 50:59.363
No, Becca couldn't do this on
her own. It's happening too fast.

50:59.369 --> 51:00.364
LOUIS: What do you mean?

51:00.370 --> 51:02.363
Brandon must have known.

51:02.369 --> 51:04.363
Okay, here it is. "Studio head Brandon
Fisher released a statement, saying,

51:04.369 --> 51:09.363
"'The moment we learned of Ms. Morgan's
injury, we stopped the production.

51:09.369 --> 51:11.363
"'At Gravity, the safety of talent
and crew is our first priority.'"

51:11.369 --> 51:14.363
But, hold on, we told Brandon
that we already had Carey Mulligan.

51:14.369 --> 51:16.363
Who cares if Becca's got
fucking dust in her eye?

51:16.369 --> 51:17.364
This doesn't make sense.

51:17.370 --> 51:19.363
Well, you're the one
who's in touch with him.

51:19.369 --> 51:22.369
I don't know what's going
on any more than you do!

51:25.369 --> 51:27.363
We keep shooting? (SIGHS)

51:27.369 --> 51:30.363
HAFDIS: They're shutting down my movie.

51:30.369 --> 51:34.363
Well, fuck 'em! Let's go home, folks.

51:34.369 --> 51:37.369
FIRST AD: All right,
people, that's a wrap.

51:39.369 --> 51:40.363
MAN: Great!

51:40.369 --> 51:41.363
WOMAN 1: Stop what you're doing.

51:41.369 --> 51:42.369
WOMAN 2: I needed this job!

51:44.369 --> 51:47.369
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

51:50.369 --> 51:53.363
Okay. Okay, so, we talk to Brandon.

51:53.369 --> 51:58.143
We explain to him, again, that we
don't need Becca, we can sort this.

51:58.369 --> 52:00.363
- Buddy, where's Amara?
- Right?

52:00.369 --> 52:01.363
Hey, did she come with you?

52:01.369 --> 52:02.364
She's at the hotel when I left, so...

52:02.370 --> 52:06.369
Okay, this means Amara
lost money, right?

52:08.369 --> 52:10.369
Did Amara just lose her investment?

52:12.369 --> 52:13.369
Oh, fuck!

52:16.369 --> 52:17.369
APRIL: Where is he going?

52:18.369 --> 52:20.369
- LOUIS: Here, come on!
- APRIL: Why is he running?

52:21.369 --> 52:22.369
We're outta here, come on!

52:24.940 --> 52:26.655
Where are you goin?

52:27.369 --> 52:30.337
It's okay. We'll tell
Amara that there's

52:30.448 --> 52:31.931
no problem. That we can fix this.

52:32.050 --> 52:35.363
Tell her from the road, because we're
not gonna be here when she shows up.

52:35.369 --> 52:37.369
April! Thank you for everything!
