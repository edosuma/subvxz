D'oh!

00:37.078 --> 00:39.414
-Aah!
-(tires screeching)

00:58.641 --> 01:01.311
Oh! How can they
imprison kids in school

01:01.394 --> 01:03.021
on a beautiful day like this?

01:03.104 --> 01:05.982
They're not imprisoning
us, Bart, they're--

01:09.819 --> 01:11.071
Prison bus, Otto?

01:11.154 --> 01:12.822
The regular school bus
broke down.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.657
So take a seat before
I blow your heads off!

01:14.741 --> 01:16.868
-Otto!
-Oh, sorry.

01:16.951 --> 01:19.788
This bus and I have sort of
a Shining thing going on.

01:22.123 --> 01:23.625
(blues harmonica)

01:28.129 --> 01:30.131
(sighs deeply)

01:35.512 --> 01:37.472
Ahh--

01:40.809 --> 01:45.563
(sighs)
This is what being a kid is all about.

01:48.233 --> 01:51.986
Hey, Huck,
what's L-I-N-C-O-N doing here?

01:52.070 --> 01:53.696
I don't know.
It's your fantasy.

01:53.780 --> 01:56.282
-Hi, Abe.
-Hello, Bart.

01:59.160 --> 02:02.580
(all groaning)
Ow! Ow!

02:02.664 --> 02:06.543
Well, children, our new ultra-hard
posturific chairs have arrived.

02:06.626 --> 02:09.170
They've been designed
by eminent posturologists

02:09.254 --> 02:11.422
to eliminate slouching
by the year 3000.

02:11.506 --> 02:13.091
Mrs. Krabappel--
(groans)

02:13.174 --> 02:15.218
I'm having back spasms!

02:15.301 --> 02:18.429
(chuckles) I know they seem a little
uncomfortable right now.

02:18.513 --> 02:21.349
But eventually your bones
will change shape.

02:21.432 --> 02:25.728
(slurred) I've lost all feeling
in the left side of my body.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.063
Yeah. Yeah.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.815
Now, unfortunately
our school clocks

02:28.898 --> 02:30.692
have been running fast
all semester,

02:30.775 --> 02:32.694
so today we all have
to stay two extra hours

02:32.777 --> 02:34.279
to make up
for the time we lost.

02:34.362 --> 02:36.865
-Ha!
-(groaning)

02:38.491 --> 02:41.286
(sighs)

02:44.330 --> 02:47.208
(chittering)

02:47.292 --> 02:48.877
(engine revving)

02:51.171 --> 02:54.924
And to think I got all this after
dropping out of the fourth grade.

02:55.008 --> 02:57.385
-(laughs)
-(tires screech)

02:57.468 --> 03:00.263
That does it. I'm outta here.

03:00.346 --> 03:02.307
Mrs. Krabappel,
I have to go to the dentist.

03:02.390 --> 03:04.809
I have a caraway seed
caught under my bridgework.

03:06.895 --> 03:08.813
My mom's number's there
if you wanna check up on me.

03:08.897 --> 03:11.191
That's okay, Bart.
I trust you.

03:13.067 --> 03:15.111
"Please excuse
my handwriting.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.363
"I busted whichever
hand it is I write with.

03:17.447 --> 03:19.407
Signed, Mrs. Simpson."

03:19.490 --> 03:20.992
You were right
to be suspicious, Edna.

03:21.075 --> 03:22.577
To the crime lab.

03:25.330 --> 03:28.249
Hmm. Inconclusive.
(scoffs)

03:28.333 --> 03:31.169
I wish more students had agreed to
these electronic tracking implants.

03:31.252 --> 03:33.296
We only had one volunteer.

03:33.379 --> 03:34.255
(beeping)

03:37.008 --> 03:39.761
Spill it!
Where's your brother?

03:39.844 --> 03:42.138
You'd better answer him, Lisa.
He's a bad man.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.932
(giggling)

03:44.015 --> 03:45.350
What are you laughing about?

03:45.433 --> 03:47.518
You started off
as the bad cop.

03:47.602 --> 03:48.978
And now you're the good one.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.648
You and Willie got mixed-up
about 10 minutes ago.

03:51.731 --> 03:52.815
We did not!
Now, where's Bart?

03:52.899 --> 03:54.108
You better tell me!

03:54.192 --> 03:55.693
Oh! You better
tell him, Lassie.

03:55.777 --> 03:57.445
I cannot control him
when he gets like this.

03:57.528 --> 04:00.365
(giggles)
Now you're the good cop.

04:00.448 --> 04:02.367
What?

04:02.450 --> 04:04.118
(sighs)

04:04.202 --> 04:06.329
The joys of
mortgaging your future.

04:06.412 --> 04:07.747
(splashing)

04:07.830 --> 04:08.706
Huh?

04:10.875 --> 04:13.753
(gasps)
My fantasy's come true!

04:16.005 --> 04:18.967
Hey, kid.
You wanna see a dead body?

04:19.050 --> 04:20.301
(screams)

04:22.428 --> 04:24.430
If I were a truant boy
out for a good time,

04:24.514 --> 04:25.932
I'd be right here--

04:26.015 --> 04:28.559
The Springfield Natural
History Museum.

04:28.643 --> 04:32.063
(chuckling)
You're mine, Simpson.

04:33.982 --> 04:36.776
Look, if I was under 17,
I'd be in school, right?

04:36.859 --> 04:39.320
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Enjoy "Boob-a-rama", sir.

04:41.614 --> 04:44.534
Why, there are no children here
at the 4-H club either.

04:44.617 --> 04:47.245
Am I so
out of touch?

04:47.328 --> 04:49.372
No. It's the children
who are wrong.

04:52.041 --> 04:53.584
-(gavel raps)
-Sold to the small man

04:53.668 --> 04:55.712
with the runny nose
for 2.3 million.

04:55.795 --> 04:57.964
-(snickers)
-(clears throat)

04:58.047 --> 05:00.133
Our next highest bid, uh,

05:00.216 --> 05:02.468
I believe was yours, sir,
for 2.1 million.

05:02.552 --> 05:04.804
(laughs)

05:04.887 --> 05:06.472
-(doors slam)
-Yes.

05:06.556 --> 05:08.766
Were there any serious bids
for this painting?

05:08.850 --> 05:10.727
(all murmuring)

05:13.313 --> 05:15.064
-(gasps)
-(gasps)

05:15.148 --> 05:17.525
Can't let Dad
see me playing hooky!

05:17.608 --> 05:19.277
I can't let the boy
see me skippin' work.

05:21.904 --> 05:24.365
-Good afternoon.
-How do you do, sir?

05:24.449 --> 05:26.826
(both snicker)

05:26.909 --> 05:28.870
BOTH: Sucker!

05:30.038 --> 05:33.291
(gasps)
A spoor! Hmm--

05:33.374 --> 05:35.752
His brand of gum,
Doublemint.

05:35.835 --> 05:37.754
Trying to double
your fun, eh, Bart?

05:37.837 --> 05:39.881
Well, I'll double
your detention.

05:39.964 --> 05:41.132
(chuckles)

05:41.215 --> 05:42.967
I wish someone
was around to hear that.

05:43.051 --> 05:47.221
And so we enter endgame.

05:52.268 --> 05:54.020
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

05:57.065 --> 05:59.317
(panting)

06:06.699 --> 06:08.576
(evil laugh)

06:08.659 --> 06:10.536
Let's see him track me now.

06:23.674 --> 06:27.261
Oh, my God! He is like
some sort of...

06:27.345 --> 06:29.472
non-giving up...

06:29.555 --> 06:31.432
school guy.

06:36.437 --> 06:38.189
(grunting)

06:47.782 --> 06:49.200
(grunting)

07:01.754 --> 07:03.423
(whimpers)

07:05.133 --> 07:07.593
Oh, he's close.

07:07.677 --> 07:09.512
I can taste his fear.

07:10.638 --> 07:11.889
What the--

07:15.518 --> 07:17.728
(laughs)

07:17.812 --> 07:21.607
Freddy, honey. I think something
just dropped into the backseat.

07:21.691 --> 07:23.067
I'm not paying you
to talk.

07:34.745 --> 07:36.497
Gimme the ball!

07:38.708 --> 07:42.587
People, the punch has been spiked.
(laughs)

07:42.670 --> 07:45.506
(laughs)
That's my nephew,

07:45.590 --> 07:49.093
displaying the Quimby wit
that's won the public's heart.

07:49.177 --> 07:50.887
Happy birthday, Freddy.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.681
And may all your disgraces
be, uh, private.

07:53.764 --> 07:56.476
-Yes.
-ALL: Hear! Hear!

08:00.771 --> 08:02.607
(grunts)

08:02.690 --> 08:04.525
And who are you,
little boy?

08:04.609 --> 08:06.652
I'm one of your nephews
you don't see very often,

08:06.736 --> 08:07.945
uh, Bart-Bart.

08:10.364 --> 08:14.327
Hey, McBain, I'm a big fan,
but your last movie really sucked.

08:14.410 --> 08:18.915
I know. There were
script problems from day one.

08:18.998 --> 08:22.126
Yeah, I'll say.
Magic ticket my ass, McBain.

08:22.210 --> 08:25.880
Maria, my mighty heart
is breaking.

08:25.963 --> 08:28.007
I'll be in the Humvee.

08:28.090 --> 08:29.467
(chattering)

08:29.550 --> 08:31.636
Hey, what the hell is this?

08:31.719 --> 08:33.596
It is a bowl
of "Shao-dair," Sir.

08:33.679 --> 08:34.597
Wait a minute.
Come here.

08:34.680 --> 08:36.015
What did you call it?

08:36.098 --> 08:37.558
Say it loud enough
so everyone can hear.

08:37.642 --> 08:39.602
Come on. Say it.

08:39.685 --> 08:41.687
(clears throat)
"Show-dair."

08:41.771 --> 08:43.189
(laughing)

08:44.774 --> 08:47.735
"Shao-dair"?
"Shao-dair"?

08:47.818 --> 08:49.570
It's "Chowdah."
Say it right!

08:51.572 --> 08:53.658
-"Shah-der."
-(laughs)

08:56.702 --> 08:58.704
Come back here! I'm not
through demeaning you!

09:02.542 --> 09:05.962
Wow! This is the biggest
Rice Krispie square I've ever seen.

09:09.590 --> 09:11.634
Boy, the rich sure
know how to live.

09:11.717 --> 09:14.804
-Say it, Frenchy. Say "Chowdah!"
-Never!

09:14.887 --> 09:18.849
FREDDY: Okay, you asked for it.
I'm gonna enjoy this.

09:18.933 --> 09:22.395
(pots banging,
glass shattering)

09:22.478 --> 09:24.772
-(snapping)
-WAITER: Ow, ooh. Ow, ooh. Ow, ooh.

09:24.855 --> 09:27.650
Whoa!

09:27.733 --> 09:31.654
(gasps)
Oy! That's gotta hurt!

09:33.197 --> 09:35.116
Oh, my God!

09:35.199 --> 09:38.869
Someone's taken a bite
out of the big Rice Krispie square!

09:38.953 --> 09:40.663
Oh, yeah, and the waiter's
been brutally beaten.

09:40.746 --> 09:41.872
(laughs)

09:43.916 --> 09:45.459
(groans)

09:45.543 --> 09:48.879
It says Freddy Quimby beat
a waiter half to death.

09:48.963 --> 09:52.550
Hmm. Those Quimby children
are so wild and rich.

09:52.633 --> 09:54.594
I hope he finally gets
what's coming to him.

09:54.677 --> 09:56.304
But Freddy Quimby's innocent!

09:56.387 --> 09:58.598
How do you know?
There weren't any witnesses.

09:58.681 --> 10:01.475
(chuckles)
Oh, yeah. Right.

10:01.559 --> 10:03.060
You'd think someone
would've seen something

10:03.144 --> 10:04.770
at a crowded party
like that.

10:04.854 --> 10:06.731
Well, they didn't, okay?
They didn't!

10:06.814 --> 10:09.233
It says so right here
in black-and-white, "No witnesses."

10:09.317 --> 10:12.403
Case closed.
Now, let's all read the funnies.

10:12.486 --> 10:14.697
Oh, look, Charlie Brown
said, "Good grief."

10:14.780 --> 10:17.658
(chuckles)
I didn't see that comin'.

10:19.452 --> 10:22.246
Lisa, I gotta tell somebody.

10:22.330 --> 10:24.206
I was at the Quimby
compound yesterday

10:24.290 --> 10:25.625
when that frog waiter
got whacked.

10:25.708 --> 10:27.877
I know that Freddy Quimby
is innocent.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.587
You're a witness?

10:29.670 --> 10:30.963
Bart, you have to
tell the police.

10:31.047 --> 10:33.924
-(sighs) I can't.
-Why?

10:34.008 --> 10:37.887
Bart Simpson, I know you
cut school yesterday.

10:37.970 --> 10:40.222
And as soon as I can prove it,
I'm shipping you off

10:40.306 --> 10:43.100
to the Christian
military reform school.

10:43.184 --> 10:45.102
What he said.

10:45.186 --> 10:46.771
Oh, I see.

10:46.854 --> 10:49.690
If you testify, Skinner
will know you skipped school.

10:49.774 --> 10:52.068
Well, if Freddy Quimby
didn't do it,

10:52.151 --> 10:55.863
I'm sure he'll be found innocent
by a fair and impartial jury.

10:55.946 --> 10:58.074
Oh, jury duty!

10:58.157 --> 10:59.909
I'll see that Quimby kid
hang for this!

10:59.992 --> 11:01.577
(groans)

11:01.661 --> 11:03.954
I knew it was a bad idea
to watch him open the mail.

11:04.038 --> 11:07.541
Let's go over to the county
courthouse live to Kent Brockman.

11:07.625 --> 11:11.295
--ockman, just outside the county
courtroom where an argument about chowder

11:11.379 --> 11:14.632
has spilled over into the biggest trial
in Springfield history.

11:14.715 --> 11:17.385
Behind these doors,
a federal judge

11:17.468 --> 11:18.636
will ladle out
steaming bowls

11:18.719 --> 11:20.554
of rich, creamy justice

11:20.638 --> 11:22.139
in a case the media
have dubbed

11:22.223 --> 11:24.266
"Beat-up waiter."
(scoffs)

11:24.350 --> 11:26.310
This reporter
suggested "Waitergate,"

11:26.394 --> 11:28.479
but was shouted down
at the press club.

11:28.562 --> 11:31.190
Now, it's illegal to televise
court proceedings in this state,

11:31.273 --> 11:32.608
(whispering)
so we'll have to be quiet.

11:32.692 --> 11:33.651
Oh!

11:38.531 --> 11:41.158
SKINNER: <i>I know you can</i>
<i>read my thoughts, Bart.</i>

11:41.242 --> 11:44.995

<i>Yes, you heard me.</i>

11:49.333 --> 11:52.503

11:52.586 --> 11:56.340

12:02.346 --> 12:07.017
I intend to prove that
Freddy Quimby is totally innocent.

12:07.101 --> 12:11.147
First of all, his accuser
is a very shady character.

12:11.230 --> 12:14.984
That waiter, Mr. Lacoste,
not only wasn't born in Springfield,

12:15.067 --> 12:18.863
he wasn't even born
in this country!

12:18.946 --> 12:22.116
(gasping, murmuring)

12:22.199 --> 12:23.492
It's an exclusive!

12:23.576 --> 12:25.578
From now on,
you tell me everything.

12:25.661 --> 12:29.957
Uh, Freddy Quimby was with me
the entire night in question.

12:30.040 --> 12:33.461
We were collecting canned goods
for the starving people in,

12:33.544 --> 12:35.838
uh, you know,
one of them loser countries.

12:35.921 --> 12:37.715
-Well, that clears Quimby.
-He's clearly innocent.

12:39.049 --> 12:41.677
Oh, good.
My laundry is done.

12:41.761 --> 12:44.013
You see, Lisa?
They don't need my testimony.

12:44.096 --> 12:47.099
Only because Mayor Quimby
is buying his nephew's freedom.

12:47.183 --> 12:49.518
(sighs)
The system works.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.228
Just ask Claus von Bulow.

12:51.312 --> 12:53.814
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going
to prove to you not only

12:53.898 --> 12:55.733
that Freddy Quimby is guilty,

12:55.816 --> 12:59.028
but that he is also innocent
of not being guilty.

12:59.111 --> 13:02.239
I refer you to my
expert witness, Dr. Hibbert.

13:02.323 --> 13:04.617
Well, only one in
two million people has

13:04.700 --> 13:07.244
what we call
the "evil gene."

13:07.328 --> 13:10.289
Hitler had it.
Walt Disney had it.

13:10.372 --> 13:13.501
And Freddy Quimby has it.
(chuckles)

13:13.584 --> 13:17.046
Thank you, Dr. Hibbert.
I rest my case.

13:17.129 --> 13:19.048
You rest your case?

13:19.131 --> 13:21.467
What? Oh, no. I thought that
was just a figure of speech.

13:21.550 --> 13:23.844
Case closed.

13:23.928 --> 13:26.013
Excuse me, your honor.

13:26.096 --> 13:28.933
Yes, I'd like to bring something
to the court's attention.

13:29.016 --> 13:30.893
(snoring)

13:34.271 --> 13:35.481
Huh? What?

13:35.564 --> 13:37.274
Give those glasses
to the bailiff.

13:37.358 --> 13:38.901
All right.

13:40.945 --> 13:42.988
-And those.
-Oh!

13:43.072 --> 13:46.116
Your Honor, even though
I've proven my client's innocence,

13:46.200 --> 13:49.286
I'd still like to call
Freddy Quimby to the stand

13:49.370 --> 13:52.873
so that we can all
bask in his gentle decency.

13:52.957 --> 13:55.251
He's wealthy,
therefore, inherently good.

13:55.334 --> 13:57.044
WOMAN: He has
innocent-looking hair.

13:57.127 --> 14:00.589
Mr. Quimby, did you
assault Mr. Lacoste?

14:00.673 --> 14:04.760
Of course not. I love each and every
living thing on God's green earth.

14:04.844 --> 14:07.930
Well, therefore, you certainly would
never lose your temper

14:08.013 --> 14:11.392
over something as trivial
as the pronunciation of "chowder."

14:11.475 --> 14:13.978
That's "chowdah!"
"Chowdah!" I'll kill you!

14:14.061 --> 14:15.729
I'll kill all of you!

14:15.813 --> 14:17.439
Especially those of you
in the jury!

14:17.523 --> 14:19.358
-(gasps, murmuring)
-He's clearly guilty.

14:19.441 --> 14:22.278
Wow, that didn't go well.
The defense rests.

14:22.361 --> 14:25.155
Will the jury retire
and come to its decision?

14:25.239 --> 14:26.991
(chuckles)
This won't take long.

14:27.074 --> 14:28.284
He's clearly guilty.

14:28.367 --> 14:30.995
We'll probably be home
by dinnertime.

14:31.078 --> 14:34.665
Good. Tonight, the dog from <i>Frasier</i>
is gonna ride the dolphin on <i>Seaquest.</i>

14:36.083 --> 14:37.501
Well, Bart,
because of you,

14:37.585 --> 14:40.629
a horrible yet innocent
person is going to jail.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.799
Hmm. Maybe I should
come forward.

14:43.883 --> 14:47.303
Oh, I can't wait till the sentencing part.
That's where I really shine.

14:49.680 --> 14:52.725
Bart Simpson,
for the heinous crime of hooky,

14:52.808 --> 14:56.854
I sentence you to a lifetime
of hard labor in the cafeteria.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.983
(raspy voice)
More creamed corn, Jimbo Jr.?

15:01.066 --> 15:04.236
This creamed corn tastes
like creamed crap.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.196
Watch the potty mouth, honey.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.951
(sighs)

15:11.035 --> 15:13.245
Your sister says you have
something to tell me.

15:13.329 --> 15:15.164
What? Uh--

15:15.247 --> 15:17.541
Um, yeah. Oh, I just--

15:17.625 --> 15:19.335
I just wanted to say
how great it is

15:19.418 --> 15:21.587
to finally see some
chicks on the bench.

15:21.670 --> 15:23.672
-Mm.
-Keep up the good work, toots.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.883
(laughs)

15:25.966 --> 15:27.092
(door closes)

15:27.176 --> 15:28.677
(groans)

15:28.761 --> 15:31.221
(chuckles)
Chicks on the bench.

15:31.305 --> 15:32.348
(nervous chuckle)

15:40.230 --> 15:42.149
Why bother votin'?
He's guilty.

15:42.232 --> 15:43.901
Well, we might as well
make it official.

15:43.984 --> 15:45.653
What does "sequestered" mean?

15:45.736 --> 15:47.821
If the jury is deadlocked,
they're put up in a hotel together

15:47.905 --> 15:49.782
so they can't communicate
with the outside world.

15:49.865 --> 15:51.158
What does "deadlocked" mean?

15:51.241 --> 15:53.202
It's when the jury
can't agree on a verdict.

15:53.285 --> 15:56.163
-Uh-huh. And "if"?
-A conjunction meaning

15:56.246 --> 15:58.165
"in the event that"
Or "on condition that."

15:58.248 --> 16:02.211
So if we don't all
vote the same way,

16:02.294 --> 16:05.047
we'll be deadlocked

16:05.130 --> 16:07.967
and have to be
sequestered

16:08.050 --> 16:09.760
in the Springfield
Palace hotel.

16:09.843 --> 16:11.762
That's not
gonna happen, Homer.

16:11.845 --> 16:13.973
Let's vote.
My liver is failing.

16:14.056 --> 16:15.432
Where we'll get:

16:15.516 --> 16:17.559
A free room, free food,
free swimming pool,

16:17.643 --> 16:19.603
free HBO--
Ooh! "Free Willy"!

16:19.687 --> 16:21.605
Justice is not
a frivolous thing, Simpson.

16:21.689 --> 16:24.191
It has little, if anything,
to do with a disobedient whale.

16:24.274 --> 16:25.526
Now let's vote.

16:25.609 --> 16:26.902
Uh, how are
the rest of you voting?

16:26.986 --> 16:29.488
-Guilty.
-Okay, fine.

16:29.571 --> 16:32.408
-How many s's in "innocent"?
-(groaning)

16:32.491 --> 16:34.868
I'm only doing
what I think is right.

16:34.952 --> 16:39.164
I believe Freddy Quimby should
walk out of here a free hotel.

16:43.544 --> 16:45.504
Oh, I miss you too, Marge.

16:45.587 --> 16:50.300
But the law needs me.
I'll be home as soon as I can.

16:50.384 --> 16:52.386
Room service, send up
two more pot roasts

16:52.469 --> 16:55.055
and three more pillows
with mints on 'em.

16:56.765 --> 16:59.059
You know,
(chuckles)

16:59.143 --> 17:01.145
We're kind of like
the original odd couple.

17:01.228 --> 17:02.938
You're the messy one,
and I'm--

17:03.022 --> 17:04.064
Shut up!

17:04.148 --> 17:05.816
Oh, yes.
Very well.

17:05.899 --> 17:08.110
-(Itchy and Scratchy theme)
-So, Bart,

17:08.193 --> 17:10.946
have your insides been
gnawed away by guilt yet?

17:11.030 --> 17:12.740
Sell it to hallmark, sis.

17:12.823 --> 17:14.700
You're looking
at cucumber boy.

17:14.783 --> 17:16.243
As in, "Cool as a."

17:16.326 --> 17:18.120
<i>ANNOUNCER:</i>
<i>Next on "McGarnigal"--</i>

17:18.203 --> 17:20.748
<i>McGarnigal is framed for</i>
<i>a crime he didn't commit.</i>

17:20.831 --> 17:23.333
<i>And only one witness</i>
<i>can clear his name,</i>

17:23.417 --> 17:27.129
<i>a little sissy boy who's too</i>
<i>scared to come forward.</i>

17:27.212 --> 17:29.214
<i>You gotta tell 'em</i>
<i>what you saw, Billy.</i>

17:29.298 --> 17:32.051
<i>But I'm so scared,</i>
<i>McGarnigal.</i>

17:32.134 --> 17:35.512
<i>You gotta do this one for me, Billy.</i>
<i>McGarnigal.</i>

17:35.596 --> 17:39.308
<i>Okay. For you,</i>
<i>McGarnigal.</i>

17:39.391 --> 17:43.479
<i>Well, McGarnigal,</i>
<i>Billy is dead!</i>

17:43.562 --> 17:45.856
<i>They slit his throat</i>
<i>from ear to ear.</i>

17:45.939 --> 17:49.318
<i>Hey, I'm trying</i>

17:52.279 --> 17:55.365

17:55.449 --> 17:57.201
Jump with all your might.

18:02.456 --> 18:04.666
<i>Ahh--</i>

18:04.750 --> 18:06.460
<i>-(screams)</i>
<i>-(splats)</i>

18:06.543 --> 18:07.795
WOMAN: <i>Oh, no.</i>
<i>Willy didn't make it!</i>

18:07.878 --> 18:09.755
<i>And he crushed our boy!</i>

18:09.838 --> 18:11.381
MAN: <i>Ugh! What a mess.</i>

18:11.465 --> 18:14.927
Oh! I don't like this
new director's cut.

18:15.010 --> 18:17.805
(straining)

18:17.888 --> 18:19.973
-Got it, Barn?
-Got what?

18:20.057 --> 18:21.767
-(crashes)
-Ow!

18:21.850 --> 18:24.019
-You're stealing a table?
-I'm not stealin' it.

18:24.103 --> 18:27.523
Hotels expect you
to take a few things. It's a souvenir.

18:27.606 --> 18:29.149
Ah. Is that my necktie
you're wearing?

18:29.233 --> 18:30.109
Souvenir.

18:30.192 --> 18:31.610
(humming)

18:31.693 --> 18:34.196
Mom, what if there's
a really bad, crummy guy

18:34.279 --> 18:36.156
who's going to jail,
but I know he's innocent.

18:36.240 --> 18:39.576
Well, Bart, your Uncle Arthur
used to have a saying,

18:39.660 --> 18:41.954
"Shoot 'em all,
and let God sort 'em out."

18:42.037 --> 18:45.040
Unfortunately, one day he put
his theory into practice.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.251
It took 75 federal marshals
to bring him down.

18:47.334 --> 18:49.378
Now, let's never
speak of him again.

18:49.461 --> 18:51.130
(humming)

18:53.090 --> 18:56.051
Mom? Mom!

18:56.135 --> 18:57.469
-Mom!
-Hmm?

18:57.553 --> 18:59.930
What if I can get
this guy off the hook?

19:00.013 --> 19:01.974
I mean,
sh-should I do it?

19:02.057 --> 19:04.726
Honey, you should listen
to your heart

19:04.810 --> 19:07.312
and not
the voices in your head,

19:07.396 --> 19:10.566
like a certain uncle did
one gray December morn.

19:10.649 --> 19:12.359
(humming)

19:12.442 --> 19:14.528
(sighs)

19:14.611 --> 19:16.947
Even though reopening
a trial at this point

19:17.030 --> 19:20.409
is illegal and grossly
unconstitutional,

19:20.492 --> 19:22.786
I just can't
say no to kids.

19:22.870 --> 19:24.204
(gavel bangs)

19:24.288 --> 19:26.665
So, young man,

19:26.748 --> 19:30.752
if Freddy Quimby didn't inflict
these injuries on Mr. Lacoste,

19:30.836 --> 19:33.755
just who did?

19:33.839 --> 19:36.592
Well, I was hiding in the kitchen
when it all happened.

19:36.675 --> 19:39.386
Say it, Frenchy!
Say "chowdah"!

19:39.469 --> 19:41.847
-Never!
-Okay, you asked for it.

19:41.930 --> 19:43.849
I'm gonna enjoy this.

19:43.932 --> 19:46.018
(grunting)

19:46.810 --> 19:47.686
(scoffs)

19:48.979 --> 19:49.897
Ooh, ooh!

19:49.980 --> 19:50.981
(grunting)

19:54.610 --> 19:56.195
(screams)

19:59.114 --> 20:01.116
(screams)

20:01.200 --> 20:03.202
-(traps snapping)
-Ow, ooh. Ow, ooh. Ow, ooh.

20:11.084 --> 20:12.711
And that's what really happened.

20:12.794 --> 20:14.254
This is an outrage!

20:14.338 --> 20:17.424
I am not a clumsy
Clouseau-esque waiter!

20:17.507 --> 20:20.552
I will--
Whoa! Whoo! Whoo!

20:20.636 --> 20:22.137
(screaming)

20:22.221 --> 20:24.890
Ooh! Ow! Ow! Ow!

20:24.973 --> 20:27.351
At least there
were no big ones.

20:27.434 --> 20:29.102
-(loud snap)
-MAN: <i>Ay.</i>

20:29.186 --> 20:30.896
How could you have
seen all this, Bart?

20:30.979 --> 20:32.564
Weren't you supposed
to be in school?

20:32.648 --> 20:34.691
(inhales)

20:34.775 --> 20:37.861
I... sorta skipped school.

20:37.945 --> 20:40.822
I knew it! I knew you'd slip up
sooner or later, Simpson!

20:40.906 --> 20:42.157
What slipup?
What are you talking about?

20:42.241 --> 20:43.158
He confessed it.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.910
Quiet.
I need this.

20:44.993 --> 20:48.622
This court finds Freddy Quimby
innocent of all charges.

20:48.705 --> 20:50.958
-(gavel slams)
-Case dismissed.

20:51.041 --> 20:52.793
(cheering)

20:55.587 --> 20:58.298
Bart, I'm impressed with
what you did in there.

20:58.382 --> 21:00.008
You testified for
the Quimby boy,

21:00.092 --> 21:02.344
even though it was putting
your own head in a noose.

21:02.427 --> 21:04.596
On the other hand,
you skipped school.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.766
I guess the two things
cancel each other out, huh.

21:07.849 --> 21:09.184
(sighs)

21:09.268 --> 21:11.687
I'm a small man
in some ways, Bart.

21:11.770 --> 21:14.314
A small, petty man.

21:14.398 --> 21:15.524
Three months detention.

21:15.607 --> 21:16.483
(groans)

21:17.609 --> 21:20.696
Wait a minute, Bart.

21:20.779 --> 21:22.698
Make that...

21:22.781 --> 21:24.366
four months detention.

21:26.368 --> 21:28.745
HOMER:
Well, Marge, it was horrible.

21:28.829 --> 21:31.164
Everyone was against me
in that jury room.

21:31.248 --> 21:33.500
But I stood by the courage
of my convictions,

21:33.583 --> 21:34.960
and I prevailed.

21:35.043 --> 21:38.714
And that's why we had
Chinese food for lunch.

21:38.797 --> 21:40.716
Good for you, Homey.

21:40.799 --> 21:42.759
You know, a lot of things
happened around here

21:42.843 --> 21:44.052
while you were gone.

21:44.136 --> 21:46.930
Great, Marge.
I want to hear all about it.

21:47.014 --> 21:48.307
(chuckles)

21:48.390 --> 21:49.391
MARGE: Give me those!

21:49.474 --> 21:50.600

21:50.684 --> 21:52.602
-And those.
