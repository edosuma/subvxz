00:07.037 --> 00:09.048
<i>Previously on</i> Penny Dreadful...

00:11.396 --> 00:14.496
I annihilated a tribe.
I betrayed my family.

00:14.521 --> 00:16.434
And I will send my father to hell,

00:16.459 --> 00:17.715
and laugh while I do it.

00:17.740 --> 00:23.022
If we lose Ethan to evil,
the night will never end.

00:23.023 --> 00:25.576
<i>Ethan Talbot is a
scourge upon the earth.</i>

00:25.601 --> 00:28.198
If given the chance, I will
shoot him in the back.

00:28.768 --> 00:31.276
I don't know that I've ever
been asked out by a woman.

00:31.870 --> 00:33.579
I'll never forget your name again.

00:33.604 --> 00:35.214
<i>Tell me about
the Banning Clinic.</i>

00:35.215 --> 00:37.196
<i>- What do you remember?</i>
<i>- Everything.</i>

00:37.197 --> 00:38.940
His name is Dracula.

00:38.965 --> 00:40.036
But it's impossible.

00:40.061 --> 00:41.564
Nothing's impossible.

00:41.589 --> 00:44.163
Take it as a sign of
something like love.

00:44.164 --> 00:45.354
<i>Goodbye.</i>

00:45.379 --> 00:48.017
She is mine!

00:48.042 --> 00:49.658
We will have her.

00:49.683 --> 00:52.002
Are you interested in taking
the bloody flat or not?

00:53.010 --> 00:55.264
I'm interested in finding
<i>the people who lived here.</i>

00:56.027 --> 00:58.323
Well, what do you do when
you've assembled an army?

00:59.044 --> 01:00.642
You go to war.

01:00.667 --> 01:02.720
<i>Will you be able to
bring your Lily to this place?</i>

01:02.745 --> 01:04.229
To insert the needle into her eye?

01:04.659 --> 01:06.674
The prodigal son has returned.

01:06.885 --> 01:08.415
What do you want to do with this one?

01:08.440 --> 01:10.099
Let him die slow.

01:10.100 --> 01:12.917
<i>Time you see
what it is you did, son.</i>

01:12.942 --> 01:14.601
<i>You brought the devil to my door.</i>

01:14.626 --> 01:15.737
And you gave him the key.

01:28.188 --> 01:29.889
You will repent.

01:32.746 --> 01:35.799
Or I will send you to hell myself.

01:37.011 --> 01:38.588
I'm done repenting...

01:41.060 --> 01:42.962
And I belong in hell.

01:49.628 --> 01:50.639
Sir.

01:52.684 --> 01:53.735
What do you want?

01:54.087 --> 01:56.089
Someone's here to see you.

02:18.828 --> 02:19.849
Mr. Talbot.

02:25.244 --> 02:26.630
You're Ethan's father.

02:26.655 --> 02:27.766
That's right.

02:29.210 --> 02:31.192
Then under the joint authority

02:32.232 --> 02:34.254
of Her Majesty the Queen of England

02:35.267 --> 02:37.902
and the President of the United States,

02:37.927 --> 02:39.769
I declare you all...

02:41.320 --> 02:43.222
under arrest.

02:51.119 --> 02:54.775
- sync and corrections by Caio -
- www.addic7ed.com -

04:28.348 --> 04:31.035
What news of her guardian, Sir Malcolm?

04:31.153 --> 04:34.256
Oh, on some mad hunt in America.

04:34.444 --> 04:38.338
The only other she speaks
of is an old love.

04:38.814 --> 04:40.816
He too has abandoned her.

04:41.334 --> 04:42.425
The Wolf.

04:44.143 --> 04:45.184
Where is he?

04:45.209 --> 04:46.330
She doesn't know.

04:47.518 --> 04:49.309
What else?

04:50.330 --> 04:51.341
Uh...

04:52.799 --> 04:54.791
Speak. Now...

04:54.910 --> 04:56.451
or I will feed you to them.

04:59.288 --> 05:02.551
She knows your name, Master.

05:03.192 --> 05:05.699
She called you Dracula.

05:06.276 --> 05:07.902
Then the time is upon us.

05:10.284 --> 05:11.887
Soon she will come to me.

05:12.563 --> 05:15.334
You will not pass me
by, will you, Master,

05:15.335 --> 05:19.254
when you distribute all
the fat, juicy things?

05:19.795 --> 05:21.848
All the sweeties.

05:31.862 --> 05:33.885
You are my chosen one, Renfield.

05:34.683 --> 05:36.664
Feed.

06:10.227 --> 06:11.704
Miss Ives!

06:11.729 --> 06:13.731
What a transcendent surprise!

06:13.756 --> 06:15.625
Come, come. Do have a seat.

06:16.776 --> 06:18.898
Do wait while I send
someone for the seat.

06:19.070 --> 06:21.963
Are you leaving, off on an expedition?

06:21.988 --> 06:24.130
An expedition, heaven forfend!

06:24.207 --> 06:26.059
Just a jaunt over to Cairo.

06:26.630 --> 06:29.133
At least that's what I've
been assured this will be.

06:29.286 --> 06:31.172
If I see a tent, I shall faint.

06:31.208 --> 06:32.782
Just a jaunt?

06:32.807 --> 06:34.779
For appearance sake.

06:34.804 --> 06:36.866
A trip to the tomb of Imhotep.

06:36.891 --> 06:39.436
But
strictly <i>entre nous,</i>

06:39.461 --> 06:42.262
one has heard that Cairo
is considerably more...

06:42.316 --> 06:45.243
accepting of my particular way of life.

06:46.210 --> 06:49.123
I imagine the expedition
will be extended.

06:49.828 --> 06:51.730
Indefinitely.

06:54.418 --> 06:56.481
Oh, whatever will I do without you?

06:56.506 --> 06:59.251
Oh, my dear, your life
is far too glittering

06:59.276 --> 07:01.076
for an old man like me.

07:01.077 --> 07:04.010
Condemn me to the sand and dust.

07:04.504 --> 07:05.586
Write often...

07:09.074 --> 07:11.156
and think of me only when you dance.

07:14.135 --> 07:15.186
Are you quite well?

07:17.289 --> 07:20.633
Yes, and I shall leave you to it.

07:20.658 --> 07:22.660
Was there something you needed?

07:22.685 --> 07:25.607
No, no, just, um, in the neighborhood.

07:26.615 --> 07:29.537
But should the need ever arise

07:29.562 --> 07:32.806
that I require someone with
expertise similar to yours,

07:33.101 --> 07:35.023
do you know a man I may call on?

07:35.048 --> 07:36.869
Are you in danger?

07:38.318 --> 07:40.508
I'm quite safe.

07:45.879 --> 07:47.914
I think the two of you...

07:50.317 --> 07:53.250
would make quite the formidable match.

07:57.321 --> 08:00.334
If the need ever arose.

08:02.970 --> 08:05.727
I trust you will take care
of yourself, Miss Ives.

08:06.262 --> 08:09.215
And you, my dear Mr. Lyle.

08:15.875 --> 08:17.867
I shall have to dance more often.

08:35.345 --> 08:39.008
Careful now, Victor. No deep breaths.

08:47.818 --> 08:49.780
Are you sure this will be satisfactory?

08:49.805 --> 08:52.254
There isn't a man alive who
could withstand its potency.

08:52.279 --> 08:54.750
She's considerably more
powerful than any man...

08:54.994 --> 08:56.095
and not entirely alive.

08:56.120 --> 08:58.222
It could take down an elephant.

08:58.247 --> 09:00.299
She will be unconscious
within two breaths.

09:01.232 --> 09:03.024
And then?

09:03.049 --> 09:05.051
And then she'll be yours, old boy.

09:05.539 --> 09:07.579
To do with as you will.

09:14.245 --> 09:17.098
You do still have the
nerve to bring Lily here.

09:17.123 --> 09:19.295
Oh, you've not met her, old boy.

09:20.144 --> 09:22.156
You'll be the one who needs the nerve.

09:48.072 --> 09:51.065
Is this where she lives? The pale lady?

09:51.090 --> 09:53.112
Her that makes men bleed?

10:01.382 --> 10:03.109
You cut them here.

10:05.597 --> 10:07.145
If you do it right,

10:07.170 --> 10:09.322
their blood will paint the walls.

10:09.347 --> 10:11.179
They'll die quickly.

10:12.019 --> 10:14.383
You'll have long enough to
see it in their eyes...

10:15.292 --> 10:19.204
the shock, the horror.

10:20.123 --> 10:21.985
Push the blade in here.

10:22.822 --> 10:24.734
When they try to scream,

10:24.759 --> 10:27.032
blood will pour out of their mouths.

10:30.765 --> 10:33.282
And if they force you to your knees...

10:39.169 --> 10:40.170
There.

10:41.037 --> 10:44.829
You must be quick, and
you must be vicious.

10:50.777 --> 10:53.398
We are not women who crawl.

10:54.299 --> 10:56.101
We are not women who kneel.

10:56.927 --> 10:59.810
And for this we will
be branded radicals.

11:00.068 --> 11:02.090
Revolutionists.

11:02.668 --> 11:04.360
Women who are strong,

11:05.742 --> 11:07.811
and refuse to be degraded,

11:07.836 --> 11:11.447
and choose to protect themselves,
are called monsters.

11:13.744 --> 11:15.646
That is the world's crime,

11:16.765 --> 11:18.491
not ours.

11:19.469 --> 11:21.243
Who wishes to try?

11:24.757 --> 11:26.227
I shan't go easy on you.

11:26.252 --> 11:29.125
Then you'll play the
part of a John well.

11:30.608 --> 11:32.710
I suppose you've had a lot of practice?

11:34.166 --> 11:36.999
How many women have you paid to debase?

11:38.333 --> 11:40.395
Treat me as you did them.

11:42.113 --> 11:44.045
Fuck me, you filth.

11:46.798 --> 11:48.945
Beat me, you cunt.

11:50.537 --> 11:52.071
Photograph me while you do it,

11:52.096 --> 11:54.128
so you can pleasure yourself after.

11:55.908 --> 11:57.419
Well done, Justine.

11:57.444 --> 11:59.326
Who's next?

12:11.528 --> 12:13.540
You're pushing your luck, my dear.

12:14.625 --> 12:16.008
Am I now?

12:20.283 --> 12:23.176
Would you like to see him
drown in his own blood?

12:25.302 --> 12:27.334
Well then, who would the
others practice on?

12:34.054 --> 12:35.175
Who's next?

13:42.613 --> 13:44.605
Drink.

14:05.642 --> 14:07.415
Thank you.

14:13.238 --> 14:14.829
Would that I could do more.

14:16.555 --> 14:18.150
Father?

14:19.256 --> 14:21.173
Are you there?

14:24.592 --> 14:26.364
Yes.

14:27.561 --> 14:29.483
Are you an angel?

14:31.073 --> 14:33.025
No.

14:33.820 --> 14:35.982
I heard a friend of Mother say

14:36.499 --> 14:38.744
angels would come for me soon.

14:39.642 --> 14:41.754
I hoped it would be you.

14:49.329 --> 14:50.390
Shh.

14:59.341 --> 15:01.333
I will bring you medicine.

15:02.769 --> 15:04.591
Whatever you need.

15:08.085 --> 15:11.018
This pain is fleeting,
I promise you that.

15:14.597 --> 15:16.469
You will be well, son.

15:28.611 --> 15:30.493
Father.

15:37.584 --> 15:38.765
Shh! Shh! Shh! Please!

16:49.692 --> 16:51.974
What the bloody hell was that?

16:52.069 --> 16:53.110
My God!

16:53.531 --> 16:56.524
I've never known such a
reprehensible cheat.

16:56.741 --> 16:57.922
What is your name?

16:57.947 --> 16:59.869
I should have you
struck from the league.

17:03.374 --> 17:05.366
Catriona Hartdegen.

17:05.463 --> 17:08.646
Most likely not on the
league table, I'm afraid.

17:08.839 --> 17:10.612
Not for lack of trying.

17:10.637 --> 17:14.146
And, strictly speaking, I wouldn't
categorize that as cheating,

17:14.741 --> 17:18.895
more as creative improvisation
to assure a victory,

17:19.012 --> 17:20.964
which is, as you know,

17:21.291 --> 17:23.263
rather the point.

17:24.094 --> 17:25.540
Good day, gentlemen.

17:31.954 --> 17:34.847
Yes, yes. I'll be out
of here soon enough.

17:36.215 --> 17:40.504
Are they so afraid they've
hired a woman to remove me?

17:40.529 --> 17:43.507
I imagine so, but I'm not
here on their behalf.

17:43.532 --> 17:45.895
- Do you fence?
- Alas, no.

17:45.920 --> 17:49.073
Oh, you should. It's
wonderful for the mind.

17:49.431 --> 17:52.364
Every decision reduced
to back and forth.

17:52.389 --> 17:53.570
Thrust or parry.

17:53.888 --> 17:57.927
A clarity forms during it that the
rest of the world is sadly lacking in.

17:57.934 --> 17:59.796
Life and death without the death.

18:00.368 --> 18:01.449
Most of the time.

18:03.242 --> 18:05.194
We have a mutual acquaintance...

18:05.219 --> 18:06.899
- Mr. Lyle.
- Ah!

18:06.923 --> 18:08.945
The indomitable Mr. Lyle!

18:09.896 --> 18:12.839
Well then, what can I
do for you, Miss...

18:12.909 --> 18:14.567
Vanessa Ives.

18:14.676 --> 18:16.628
Miss Ives.

18:16.653 --> 18:18.364
Are you an Egyptologist also?

18:18.389 --> 18:19.510
Not quite,

18:19.761 --> 18:22.694
though I have studied
the Egyptians in depth.

18:22.719 --> 18:25.293
I'm a Thanatologist, you see.

18:25.318 --> 18:26.449
I study death.

18:27.579 --> 18:29.701
Its every ritual, every guise.

18:29.796 --> 18:31.708
The great hereafter.

18:31.733 --> 18:33.575
If there is such a thing.

18:37.931 --> 18:40.954
Usually folks have run a mile by now.

18:42.421 --> 18:45.354
Most people find that
rather off-putting.

18:45.675 --> 18:47.857
I'm not most people.

18:53.824 --> 18:55.846
Are you familiar with the name Dracula?

18:58.181 --> 19:01.194
There was a medieval
warrior clan of sorts,

19:01.219 --> 19:02.280
the Dracule.

19:02.957 --> 19:05.020
The line can be traced
back to antiquity.

19:05.021 --> 19:06.853
Perhaps further.

19:07.686 --> 19:09.758
Dracula was said to be their founder.

19:09.853 --> 19:12.776
The name means "dragon" in Romanian.

19:12.801 --> 19:14.853
It suits him. More than you know.

19:14.878 --> 19:17.851
In the 13th century he provoked a war

19:17.876 --> 19:19.707
between two great empires.

19:19.732 --> 19:21.518
The Ottomans and the Holy Romans.

19:21.543 --> 19:22.293
Why?

19:22.318 --> 19:26.090
Because he wanted the world
to be wet with blood.

19:26.826 --> 19:30.286
The peasants believed
that he fed upon it.

19:30.311 --> 19:31.412
That he was...

19:32.960 --> 19:35.913
well, a vampire.

19:41.731 --> 19:43.613
You don't blink at that.

19:43.830 --> 19:45.598
I never blink.

19:47.023 --> 19:48.855
Miss, your brandies.

19:54.805 --> 19:56.807
He was said to be the first vampire.

19:57.522 --> 20:00.455
One of the few written
accounts of him is Ottoman.

20:00.480 --> 20:04.494
It tells of an ancient
being, flushed with youth.

20:04.519 --> 20:07.592
A strategist, changing his
appearance and identity

20:07.617 --> 20:09.090
from century to century.

20:09.115 --> 20:11.127
It calls him a seducer,

20:11.152 --> 20:13.957
but in the antiquated form of the word.

20:14.663 --> 20:17.371
One who is able to lead men astray,

20:17.396 --> 20:19.301
to corrupt.

20:20.098 --> 20:21.983
Beyond that, there's not a lot.

20:22.244 --> 20:25.067
I could look pre-Ottoman,
search for earlier accounts.

20:25.092 --> 20:27.481
I don't wish to find him in history.

20:27.506 --> 20:30.439
I wish to find him now, in London.

20:33.447 --> 20:35.339
If that is the case,

20:35.364 --> 20:37.516
then I would advise caution.

20:38.107 --> 20:41.551
Which would shock you
if you knew me better.

20:41.872 --> 20:44.045
I'm being hunted by him.

20:47.697 --> 20:50.580
If Dracula wanted you
dead, you would be.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.129
He doesn't want my death.

20:53.079 --> 20:55.031
He wants my submission.

20:57.451 --> 20:59.231
You seem to be a woman who understands

20:59.256 --> 21:01.388
why submission to another
would be intolerable.

21:02.537 --> 21:03.558
That I do.

21:03.590 --> 21:04.772
Even if you have to cheat.

21:05.046 --> 21:07.017
Every chance I get.

21:07.042 --> 21:08.434
Then help me.

21:08.459 --> 21:09.864
We'll cheat him together.

21:13.387 --> 21:14.488
All right.

21:14.981 --> 21:17.974
I can't promise anything,
but I'll look into it.

21:18.483 --> 21:21.473
But in the interim you
must protect yourself.

21:22.754 --> 21:24.726
He is a predator

21:24.751 --> 21:28.020
and his power comes in
isolating his prey.

21:28.273 --> 21:30.754
You must surround yourself with people,

21:30.779 --> 21:31.871
with those who care for you,

21:32.201 --> 21:34.142
those who would defend you.

21:34.711 --> 21:35.843
They are gone.

21:37.884 --> 21:39.715
Have you no one?

21:43.059 --> 21:44.140
I might.

21:44.141 --> 21:45.418
Then go to them.

21:45.443 --> 21:48.637
There is only one defense
against isolation.

21:49.268 --> 21:51.421
Be with those you love.

22:52.747 --> 22:53.818
May I cut in?

22:53.843 --> 22:55.895
You can have the next one, darling.

23:12.162 --> 23:14.083
Could we have a moment alone?

23:30.672 --> 23:32.623
I fear Justine does not know her place.

23:34.161 --> 23:35.922
She says the same of you.

23:36.453 --> 23:38.188
My place is at your side.

23:38.895 --> 23:40.797
We are equals.

23:40.822 --> 23:41.943
Partners.

23:43.120 --> 23:44.861
Immortals.

23:44.886 --> 23:46.898
What has she to stand alongside me?

23:48.813 --> 23:50.725
She has the soul of me.

23:52.387 --> 23:55.379
The very heart of who I
was before I was this.

23:56.991 --> 23:58.863
She has the anger...

24:00.790 --> 24:02.274
and the hate.

24:03.361 --> 24:04.563
And the loss.

24:05.242 --> 24:06.720
And are you no more than that?

24:07.135 --> 24:09.067
Sometimes that is all I am.

24:14.182 --> 24:17.175
I remember every man who ever used me.

24:24.486 --> 24:26.594
Every filthy alley.

24:30.007 --> 24:31.909
Every cruel bastard

24:32.948 --> 24:34.516
who hurt me

24:36.003 --> 24:37.995
and bent me to submission.

24:40.325 --> 24:44.446
All of Brona's shame and debasement.

24:46.158 --> 24:48.180
And everything she lost along the way.

24:51.291 --> 24:54.294
That is something you
cannot know, Dorian.

24:55.256 --> 24:57.108
But they can.

24:57.604 --> 24:59.079
It is who they are.

25:01.298 --> 25:03.140
Then let us be someone else.

25:09.376 --> 25:11.357
Fantasy, is it?

25:11.358 --> 25:14.311
- It is our world to make.
- Then we shall.

25:15.745 --> 25:18.227
But I'm committed to them
now, you understand that?

25:22.661 --> 25:24.623
There's so little I understand, but...

25:27.678 --> 25:29.309
I understand this.

25:34.466 --> 25:35.989
And this.

25:47.448 --> 25:49.239
If only this were true, Dorian.

25:51.009 --> 25:53.011
If only this were all.

25:54.776 --> 25:57.145
Excuse the interruption...

25:57.937 --> 25:59.859
but seems we have a visitor.

26:03.606 --> 26:07.200
It was like a blow.

26:09.019 --> 26:11.041
Realizing how much I relied on them,

26:12.091 --> 26:14.063
how much I needed them.

26:14.149 --> 26:17.072
Sir Malcolm and Mr. Chandler.

26:18.184 --> 26:20.226
I have no family left, you see.

26:20.251 --> 26:22.103
They're my family.

26:26.088 --> 26:30.062
When I was first married, I
thought I needed my husband.

26:30.087 --> 26:31.786
He was a bastard, though.

26:31.811 --> 26:34.357
The beatings started right
after the honeymoon.

26:35.111 --> 26:36.152
Then came the night

26:36.559 --> 26:38.919
he would have killed me, but...

26:38.944 --> 26:40.055
You killed him first.

26:41.448 --> 26:43.430
With a cleaver from the kitchen.

26:45.709 --> 26:46.940
Trust me, honey,

26:47.464 --> 26:49.317
when you kill your
husband with a cleaver

26:49.342 --> 26:51.919
and then stand trial for
it in New York City,

26:51.944 --> 26:53.986
you know what it is to be alone.

26:55.085 --> 26:57.653
I've tried not to rely
on anyone since then.

26:59.085 --> 27:00.434
I've done the same.

27:01.704 --> 27:03.706
But how I wish my friends were here now.

27:04.695 --> 27:06.827
I'm not the only friend you have.

27:07.132 --> 27:09.084
And wouldn't you rather be having drinks

27:09.109 --> 27:11.895
with that handsome
doctor from the museum?

27:11.962 --> 27:13.033
I'm being hunted.

27:13.827 --> 27:15.729
I won't bring him into this.

27:15.754 --> 27:17.262
Why don't you give him the choice?

27:17.484 --> 27:20.357
- He'll think I'm mad.
- I'll give you a note.

27:22.888 --> 27:24.870
You have to trust people, Vanessa.

27:24.895 --> 27:25.956
They can surprise you.

27:25.981 --> 27:27.953
They can also disappoint you.

27:27.978 --> 27:30.921
You'll never know if you
keep having drinks with me.

27:38.465 --> 27:40.536
This must
be the worst kidnapping

27:40.537 --> 27:42.438
in the annals of crime.

27:42.439 --> 27:44.501
- May I?
- No.

27:45.713 --> 27:46.784
May I?

27:49.286 --> 27:50.307
Not yet.

27:52.245 --> 27:54.317
Did you really intend to kidnap her?

27:57.117 --> 27:58.911
I intended to heal her.

27:59.126 --> 28:00.988
But I'm not ill, Victor.

28:02.474 --> 28:04.506
I am preternaturally healthy,

28:04.531 --> 28:06.083
as well you know.

28:06.108 --> 28:10.117
I have developed a serum,
a medicine of sorts.

28:11.420 --> 28:14.433
I can take all your anger and rage

28:16.034 --> 28:17.630
and make it go away.

28:19.114 --> 28:20.520
Make you whole,

28:22.126 --> 28:23.237
and human.

28:25.643 --> 28:27.536
Free from the burden of hate.

28:28.406 --> 28:31.032
Unblemished by sadness.

28:31.057 --> 28:33.209
My sadness is my own.

28:33.520 --> 28:35.391
I would never give it up.

28:35.392 --> 28:36.700
But I can make you who you were.

28:36.725 --> 28:38.667
And you think that would be kindness?

28:39.048 --> 28:42.428
I have suffered
long and hard to be who I am.

28:42.429 --> 28:45.312
I want my scars to show.

28:46.227 --> 28:47.325
We were happy.

28:47.350 --> 28:49.864
No, Victor, you were happy.

28:51.918 --> 28:53.770
I was just waiting.

28:54.861 --> 28:56.823
For all of this.

28:57.798 --> 29:01.419
You seek to violate us
and call it a kindness.

29:01.444 --> 29:02.012
Don't!

29:02.037 --> 29:04.426
I don't take orders from any man.

29:05.497 --> 29:06.817
It's senseless to murder him.

29:06.842 --> 29:09.835
For what, loving you?

29:09.951 --> 29:11.923
- Being foolish?
- Being a man.

29:12.074 --> 29:13.255
Let me do it!

29:17.534 --> 29:18.605
Lily...

29:19.571 --> 29:21.383
no.

29:27.574 --> 29:28.595
No.

29:31.615 --> 29:33.627
I suppose I'm sentimental about him.

29:34.972 --> 29:36.427
Besides...

29:37.965 --> 29:41.583
you never know when we might
need his unique services.

29:45.796 --> 29:47.868
Hear me, boy.

29:48.524 --> 29:51.779
Mend your broken heart elsewhere.

29:52.825 --> 29:55.146
Ease your conscience with another.

29:55.171 --> 29:56.685
I am done with you.

29:58.818 --> 30:00.990
The next time I see you...

30:01.568 --> 30:03.580
I'll hold the razor myself.

30:13.630 --> 30:17.524
What are you waiting on, my gratitude?

30:18.914 --> 30:21.026
You are in my debt, Victor.

30:21.291 --> 30:23.193
I will call on it.

30:34.386 --> 30:37.249
I'd like to
welcome you all to my table.

30:37.587 --> 30:40.707
Let it never be said that a
Talbot man was inhospitable.

30:40.708 --> 30:44.204
This is something I hope
you inherit, my son.

30:44.229 --> 30:47.242
Treat the stranger who sojourns with you

30:47.391 --> 30:49.218
as the natives among you,

30:49.243 --> 30:52.672
and you shall love him as yourself.

30:56.602 --> 30:58.514
I hope you gentlemen understand

30:58.545 --> 30:59.565
I would've offered you a bribe

30:59.566 --> 31:01.528
if I believed you could've been bought.

31:02.249 --> 31:05.491
Well then, I'll consider it a
compliment that you didn't offer.

31:06.674 --> 31:08.664
And might I add, my dear,

31:08.665 --> 31:11.430
that you look particularly
ravishing this evening.

31:11.455 --> 31:14.338
Well, come a little closer,
I'll give you a kiss.

31:16.693 --> 31:19.616
Will someone see what's
got into those horses?

31:19.616 --> 31:20.697
Yes, sir.

31:22.173 --> 31:24.736
Well, this looks superb.

31:24.761 --> 31:27.008
I must say...

31:27.033 --> 31:28.214
I'm as ravenous as a...

31:29.503 --> 31:31.505
One moment, Inspector.

31:31.530 --> 31:33.149
Before any of us eat,

31:33.174 --> 31:36.040
I would like my son to say grace.

31:41.797 --> 31:42.798
I'll do it.

31:42.967 --> 31:44.693
I'm asking Ethan.

31:44.718 --> 31:46.339
I'm offering on his behalf.

31:46.628 --> 31:50.462
But see, that's the grace-saying chair.

31:51.633 --> 31:52.714
Where your brother Paul was sitting.

31:52.739 --> 31:54.360
Don't do this.

31:54.385 --> 31:55.852
Whispering the Lord's Prayer...

31:55.877 --> 31:57.372
Listen to me, please.

31:57.397 --> 31:59.479
I used to speak to my son this way.

32:00.581 --> 32:02.513
I tortured him with guilt.

32:03.265 --> 32:06.243
And I tried to mold him into
the man I wanted him to be.

32:09.004 --> 32:11.166
But if I could have a
meal with him now...

32:14.258 --> 32:16.200
Learn from my mistakes.

32:18.105 --> 32:21.422
Your son is a good man.

32:23.378 --> 32:25.220
I believe this.

32:27.937 --> 32:29.751
Despite anything you may have done...

32:29.776 --> 32:31.196
May have done?

32:31.221 --> 32:32.714
I wonder, Malcolm,

32:32.739 --> 32:35.741
if it had been your son and
daughter he'd murdered...

32:40.546 --> 32:41.567
Oh...

32:42.224 --> 32:43.225
I see.

32:43.491 --> 32:44.985
He didn't tell you?

32:45.453 --> 32:47.633
This good man here...

32:48.283 --> 32:50.235
slaughtered his siblings.

32:50.627 --> 32:52.409
How?

32:53.153 --> 32:54.711
How did you do it, Ethan?

32:54.851 --> 32:56.368
Not like a man at all.

32:56.393 --> 32:57.424
I would think not.

32:57.657 --> 33:00.746
He didn't have the courage
to look his family in the eye.

33:00.747 --> 33:01.827
Tell me when.

33:01.828 --> 33:04.660
Like a coward he ran away and hid.

33:04.661 --> 33:06.063
Say the word and I'll strike.

33:06.088 --> 33:08.594
Like my son has always
run when things get bloody...

33:08.619 --> 33:09.700
Enough!

33:25.761 --> 33:27.623
Our Father,

33:28.245 --> 33:29.396
Who art in heaven,

33:30.807 --> 33:32.749
Cursed be Thy name.

33:33.780 --> 33:34.890
Thy Kingdom come.

33:34.891 --> 33:38.555
Thy will be spited, on
earth as it is in hell.

33:38.775 --> 33:39.835
That's enough.

33:39.836 --> 33:42.305
Give us this day our daily bread.

33:42.330 --> 33:44.657
And forgive us not our trespasses...

33:44.701 --> 33:45.862
I said, that's enough...

33:45.887 --> 33:48.204
As we never forgive those
who trespass against us.

33:48.229 --> 33:49.280
You will shut your mouth...

33:49.305 --> 33:51.863
Lead us into temptation
and deliver us to evil.

33:51.888 --> 33:53.704
For thine is the kingdom,

33:53.729 --> 33:55.711
the power, and the glory.

33:55.736 --> 33:56.817
For a few hours longer.

33:56.842 --> 33:58.634
- Amen.
- Amen.

34:09.914 --> 34:12.937
You have been glaring at me
throughout this entire meal.

34:13.889 --> 34:16.783
If you have something to say...

34:18.637 --> 34:21.289
The men you murdered
aboard that train...

34:21.376 --> 34:22.773
They were my men.

34:23.605 --> 34:25.476
And before this night ends,

34:25.655 --> 34:27.507
there will be a reckoning.

34:29.462 --> 34:30.533
Fair enough.

35:08.595 --> 35:10.687
The museum is closing
in 10 minutes, miss.

35:11.465 --> 35:12.556
Oh, yes, thank you.

35:12.581 --> 35:14.483
I'm looking for Dr. Sweet.

35:14.508 --> 35:16.490
Ah. Up with his pets.

35:39.831 --> 35:41.571
If we're to continue,

35:41.596 --> 35:43.718
you must know how dangerous this is.

35:46.833 --> 35:50.064
How dangerous I am.

35:53.405 --> 35:54.496
Tell me.

35:55.930 --> 35:59.809
You'll think me mad, but I'll
tell you the whole truth of it.

36:02.698 --> 36:07.673
There's a creature hunting me.

36:08.949 --> 36:11.962
He has been hunting me
since the dawn of time.

36:13.039 --> 36:16.793
He wants... to feed on my blood,

36:17.053 --> 36:19.015
and make me his bride.

36:20.006 --> 36:21.037
And...

36:24.353 --> 36:26.605
He will bring terror to everyone I love.

36:29.986 --> 36:32.779
Does this creature have a name?

36:33.932 --> 36:35.874
He's called Dracula.

36:39.786 --> 36:40.887
Can you believe me?

36:43.356 --> 36:45.368
May I show you something?

36:47.676 --> 36:50.769
We're preparing an exhibit
on nocturnal animals.

36:51.653 --> 36:55.372
For two months the Natural
History Museum shall become

36:55.397 --> 36:57.499
"The House of the Night Creatures."

37:14.388 --> 37:15.857
Ah, here we are,

37:15.882 --> 37:17.964
this is what I wanted to show you.

37:21.556 --> 37:23.488
<i>Desmodus rotundus.</i>

37:24.696 --> 37:27.724
It feeds entirely off the blood
of other living animals.

37:28.024 --> 37:29.458
So, of course,

37:29.483 --> 37:32.571
I believe what you said because
I know such monsters exist.

37:34.324 --> 37:39.228
There are creatures whom
God has cast into darkness

37:39.417 --> 37:41.185
and cursed to the night.

37:41.645 --> 37:44.688
This animal feeds off
blood because it must.

37:44.713 --> 37:47.576
Because it has been afforded
no other food source.

37:47.601 --> 37:50.594
Because if it does not, it will die.

37:52.503 --> 37:55.691
Am I to feel sympathy for
this monster who hunts me?

37:58.952 --> 38:03.022
I have come to love all the night
creatures you see around us.

38:04.692 --> 38:06.734
They are so shunned...

38:09.096 --> 38:10.917
And alone.

38:12.074 --> 38:16.093
But I have not an ounce of sympathy
for any creature who means you harm.

38:16.118 --> 38:19.999
And what defenses I can
offer, I stand at your side.

38:22.946 --> 38:24.787
There was another.

38:25.075 --> 38:28.037
He told me his only purpose
in life was to protect me.

38:29.028 --> 38:30.900
What happened to him?

38:32.539 --> 38:33.590
He left.

38:36.869 --> 38:39.792
I know what it is to be
heartbroken, Vanessa.

38:40.127 --> 38:41.928
To be rejected.

38:43.097 --> 38:45.391
Your every instinct is
to preserve and protect

38:45.416 --> 38:47.468
such a heart as you have left.

38:48.937 --> 38:52.000
But nothing you have
said has scared me away.

38:53.915 --> 38:55.847
And I will not leave your side.

39:12.446 --> 39:14.558
Every time I've given my heart,

39:14.870 --> 39:16.852
it has led to catastrophe.

39:18.780 --> 39:20.802
Then let catastrophe befall us both.

39:22.614 --> 39:26.266
Vanessa, I love you for who you are,

39:26.983 --> 39:29.815
not who the world wants you to be.

41:51.987 --> 41:54.960
You're, of course, all welcome to eat.

42:00.538 --> 42:02.560
A bit of a gamble, wouldn't you say?

42:02.857 --> 42:04.839
Giving your guests knives?

42:06.149 --> 42:07.270
Mmm.

42:07.602 --> 42:11.213
Somehow I prefer my odds.

42:12.844 --> 42:15.932
That's because you don't
understand who's sitting at your table.

42:17.906 --> 42:19.107
Back in the desert.

42:20.178 --> 42:24.338
Was it you who summoned
the snakes, or her?

42:25.261 --> 42:28.044
Snakes? What are you talking about?

42:28.069 --> 42:30.932
Your beloved son and his paramour

42:31.815 --> 42:34.848
are perhaps more ingenious
than even you know.

42:35.601 --> 42:38.456
In the ways of mayhem
and slaughter, that is.

42:40.121 --> 42:42.003
Wouldn't you say?

42:42.142 --> 42:44.084
I would indeed, Inspector.

42:45.381 --> 42:47.293
What is this, Ethan?

42:48.107 --> 42:49.228
Let me show you.

43:23.342 --> 43:24.423
What are you?

43:28.290 --> 43:30.152
One more move and I fire.

43:47.502 --> 43:49.314
What are you?

43:49.898 --> 43:51.511
We are the death knell.

43:52.139 --> 43:54.121
We are the end of days.

44:12.286 --> 44:14.629
I knew you were too mean to die.

44:28.317 --> 44:29.368
Ethan.

44:36.088 --> 44:38.020
Hell awaits us both.

45:10.715 --> 45:12.787
You know where to find me, boy!

45:13.373 --> 45:15.205
So come and get me!

45:19.798 --> 45:21.207
If I'm gonna die,

45:21.629 --> 45:24.456
I'm gonna die where you
murdered my family!

45:25.226 --> 45:27.148
It's just me and Rance now.

45:27.477 --> 45:29.239
Fair fight!

45:29.264 --> 45:31.206
He'll put men on
either side of the entrance,

45:31.231 --> 45:33.316
and he'll have guards scattered
throughout the chapel.

45:33.580 --> 45:35.612
You take everyone on the right
side, I'll take the left.

45:36.174 --> 45:38.266
You two, flank the doorway.

45:38.452 --> 45:41.324
Two of you there, other two, over there.

45:41.578 --> 45:43.360
And him?

45:46.573 --> 45:48.505
He knows what to do.

45:48.873 --> 45:50.785
He's attacked this chapel before.

45:55.592 --> 45:57.723
You want to face me?

45:57.748 --> 46:00.754
Come and face me! Like a man.

47:39.169 --> 47:40.170
Oh.

47:40.695 --> 47:43.568
You are truly my son.

47:45.325 --> 47:46.376
Do it.

47:46.959 --> 47:48.825
You wanna be the devil, hmm?

47:49.212 --> 47:50.896
Then do the devil's work.

47:51.090 --> 47:52.201
I'm unarmed.

47:53.240 --> 47:56.213
Gun down your father in
the house of God, my son.

47:56.753 --> 47:58.745
That's the man you are, isn't it?

47:59.192 --> 48:00.253
Isn't it?

48:18.775 --> 48:20.197
Oh, that's right.

48:20.222 --> 48:23.285
Run away like you've
always run all your life.

48:23.740 --> 48:26.197
You don't think I'll
send men to find you?

48:26.222 --> 48:29.447
They'll hunt you, and they'll
hunt you, and they won't stop,

48:30.243 --> 48:31.666
and when I die,

48:32.317 --> 48:34.095
I'll haunt you from the grave.

48:34.120 --> 48:36.122
My dying curse will be...
