<i>so the marra will think I'm David.</i>

13:38.442 --> 13:41.779
<i>You'll hide under David's desk</i>
<i>where the marra won't see you.</i>

13:41.862 --> 13:44.740
<i>Just to make sure the marra</i>
<i>doesn't go after you,</i>

13:44.824 --> 13:47.284
<i>you'll belt yourself</i>
<i>into the sleeping bag.</i>

13:47.785 --> 13:50.913
<i>Now, the marra always enter</i>
<i>through the keyhole,</i>

13:50.996 --> 13:52.581
<i>so Alfur will guard it.</i>

14:00.422 --> 14:01.966
<i>According to Alfur's records,</i>

14:02.049 --> 14:05.219
<i>the marra has no paperwork on file</i>
<i>with the elves,</i>

14:06.178 --> 14:08.055
<i>so she won't see him when she comes in.</i>

14:11.517 --> 14:12.351
[bones crack]

14:19.108 --> 14:23.279
[Hilda] <i>Alfur will wake you up,</i>
<i>even though you can't see him, either.</i>

14:23.362 --> 14:24.446
[whispers] Frida!

14:25.614 --> 14:28.659
[Hilda] <i>You'll use the marra's weakness,</i>
<i>the leather belt,</i>

14:28.742 --> 14:31.370
<i>to hold her in place</i>
<i>long enough for us to talk.</i>

14:32.162 --> 14:33.622
-[screams]
-Dream on.

14:34.206 --> 14:37.710
Like I'm gonna let myself get trapped
by some little kid?

14:37.793 --> 14:38.794
-Huh?
-Yep!

14:38.878 --> 14:40.546
[both grunting]

14:40.629 --> 14:41.463
You!

14:41.547 --> 14:44.550
You're that crazy girl
who's been chasing me all over town.

14:44.633 --> 14:47.887
And you're the one who's been giving
my friend David nightmares.

14:47.970 --> 14:49.638
Uh, duh!

14:49.722 --> 14:51.807
His nightmares are the best.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.726
There's so much to work with.

14:53.809 --> 14:56.020
He is scared of everything.

14:56.103 --> 14:57.354
[laughing]

14:57.438 --> 14:58.772
That's not funny.

14:58.856 --> 15:00.107
[sighs]

15:00.190 --> 15:02.943
Oh, whatever. You like scaring him, too.

15:03.027 --> 15:05.070
The Rat King told me David was, like,

15:05.154 --> 15:07.740
practically crying
when you went to see him.

15:07.823 --> 15:09.241
You know the Rat King?

15:09.325 --> 15:11.660
I'm trying to help David
get over his fears,

15:11.744 --> 15:13.913
you're just making them worse.

15:13.996 --> 15:16.081
So, I want you to leave David alone.

15:16.582 --> 15:19.543
Yeah, right.
The girls love his nightmares.

15:19.627 --> 15:20.836
I'm not giving that up.

15:20.920 --> 15:24.423
Oh, so you pick on David
because it's easy.

15:24.506 --> 15:26.508
I bet your friends
are secretly laughing at you

15:26.592 --> 15:28.510
for not stepping up your nightmare game.

15:28.594 --> 15:31.472
-Excuse me?
-Don't you think they'd be more impressed

15:31.555 --> 15:33.933
with a nightmare
from someone harder to scare?

15:34.016 --> 15:35.893
Like who? You?

15:35.976 --> 15:38.938
Unless you're afraid of a challenge.

15:39.021 --> 15:41.023
Ha! Go to sleep, then.

15:41.565 --> 15:44.526
You'll see
whose nightmare game is on point.

15:44.610 --> 15:45.569
Fine.

15:45.653 --> 15:50.032
You can take your best shot...
if you promise to leave David alone.

15:51.075 --> 15:52.534
Mm...

15:52.618 --> 15:53.452
deal.

15:54.328 --> 15:57.623
But if you wake her up before I'm done,
the deal's off.

15:57.706 --> 15:59.583
[gulps] Got it. Heh.

15:59.667 --> 16:01.710
-Sleep tight.
-Oh, I will.

16:02.252 --> 16:08.217
I'm gonna sleep so tight, you won't
believe how... tight I'm going to s-sleep.

16:16.141 --> 16:18.602
[Hilda groaning, growling]

16:24.316 --> 16:27.069
-Well?
-[groaning]

16:28.028 --> 16:29.071
I'm trying.

16:29.154 --> 16:31.949
It's not easy falling asleep
on purpose, you know.

16:33.117 --> 16:34.493
[snoring]

16:35.786 --> 16:37.913
-[snoring continues]
-[growling]

16:38.706 --> 16:40.457
[Twig whines]

16:43.544 --> 16:46.213
[yawns] Is that Hilda snoring?

16:49.133 --> 16:50.509
[both screaming]

16:53.846 --> 16:55.973
[clock ticking]

16:57.099 --> 17:00.394
[groaning]

17:00.477 --> 17:01.353
Ugh!

17:06.150 --> 17:08.152
[snoring softly]

17:21.540 --> 17:23.167
[yawns] Mum, are you up?

17:28.047 --> 17:30.174
Hilda, you let the spiders in!

17:34.720 --> 17:37.806
It's all right, Mum.
I can use these for my bug collection.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.808
Maybe I'll get a Sparrow Scout badge.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.060
You're not frightened?

17:41.143 --> 17:44.605
Not really.
They're cute in that ugly sort of way.

17:48.025 --> 17:49.318
[loud thud]

17:53.322 --> 17:55.240
[roars]

17:56.325 --> 17:57.451
[forest giant] Mmm.

17:57.534 --> 18:00.829
You'll make a fine between-meals snack.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.539
[snorts, roars]

18:02.623 --> 18:04.833
Forest giants aren't known to eat people.

18:04.917 --> 18:08.087
Are you trying new things
because your life's in a rut?

18:08.170 --> 18:10.672
Eating people won't fill that void.

18:14.218 --> 18:16.553
Whoooaf!

18:16.637 --> 18:20.766
-[woffs calling]
-Hey, "whoaf" sounds a bit like "woff."

18:21.475 --> 18:24.394
Is that why we call you a "woff"?
I bet it is.

18:28.232 --> 18:30.776
What scares you, crazy girl?

18:32.528 --> 18:33.904
But you must have a...

18:34.613 --> 18:36.156
secret.

18:44.832 --> 18:46.458
Hilda! Down here!

18:46.542 --> 18:47.918
This way! Hurry!

18:49.586 --> 18:52.172
[screams] Ooh!

18:56.468 --> 18:58.887
We don't ride woffs, we ride bikes.

18:58.971 --> 19:02.558
That's right.
The street hasn't got a woff lane, has it?

19:10.649 --> 19:11.984
W-- Wait!

19:14.278 --> 19:15.487
Ah!

19:15.571 --> 19:17.489
[panting]

19:18.073 --> 19:19.449
[screams]

19:20.450 --> 19:21.285
[tires screech]

19:21.368 --> 19:22.619
[screams]

19:22.703 --> 19:24.538
Hilda, can't you ride a bike?

19:24.621 --> 19:26.707
Even I can ride a bike.

19:29.459 --> 19:30.669
[screams]

19:31.336 --> 19:33.005
[marra laughing, echoing]

19:33.088 --> 19:35.716
Ah! [panting]

19:37.676 --> 19:40.929
It's not my fault!
I'm not from here!

19:41.555 --> 19:42.973
[demonic voice] No, you're not!

19:43.056 --> 19:44.558
[screaming]

19:45.809 --> 19:48.312
Huh, I guess she's not coming.

19:53.817 --> 19:54.776
[panting]

19:54.860 --> 19:56.320
[screams]

19:58.488 --> 20:00.449
[panting]

20:02.534 --> 20:03.869
Ah!

20:05.287 --> 20:06.121
Help!

20:06.663 --> 20:07.497
Help!

20:08.790 --> 20:14.338
[screaming]

20:14.421 --> 20:16.465
[grunting]

20:17.466 --> 20:19.593
[screaming]

20:23.639 --> 20:25.349
[screaming]

20:26.308 --> 20:27.809
[screaming echoes]

20:28.352 --> 20:29.186
[door opens]

20:29.269 --> 20:31.021
-Where's Hilda?
-[Frida] Shh!

20:31.104 --> 20:34.107
Don't wake Hilda,
or else David will keep having nightmares.

20:34.191 --> 20:35.692
What are you talking about?

20:35.776 --> 20:38.153
It's okay, though.
Uh, she's... she's fine.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.322
No! [grunts] Help!

20:41.031 --> 20:44.660
Help! Help!

20:48.163 --> 20:53.543
[screaming]

20:54.294 --> 20:56.213
[Hilda groaning]

20:56.296 --> 20:58.382
I can't make her do this for me.

20:58.465 --> 21:00.968
If she can handle them, then so can I.

21:01.051 --> 21:02.219
[Hilda screaming]

21:02.302 --> 21:04.930
-Hilda! Wake up!
-[panting]

21:07.140 --> 21:08.850
Hilda, are you all right?

21:08.934 --> 21:11.186
You were crying out in your sleep.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.897
An adventurer
never cries out in her sleep.

21:14.439 --> 21:17.109
Uh, but what are you doing
in David's bedroom?

21:17.901 --> 21:18.735
[giggles]

21:24.533 --> 21:26.535
[birds chirping]

21:31.164 --> 21:33.750
Mum wants me to stay close to home
for a couple of days.

21:33.834 --> 21:36.795
Sorry you had to wake me.
Did you have a nightmare again?

21:37.296 --> 21:40.007
Actually, no.
Sweet dreams all night.

21:40.507 --> 21:42.759
Literally about sweets.

21:42.843 --> 21:45.220
-The marra didn't come back?
-[marra] Nope.

21:45.971 --> 21:49.725
It's no fun giving nightmares to someone
who's brave enough to ask for them.

21:49.808 --> 21:50.726
Wait.

21:53.061 --> 21:54.229
How did you know?

21:55.355 --> 21:57.149
[exhales] About my secret?

21:57.232 --> 21:59.318
I know the Rat King, remember?

21:59.401 --> 22:01.611
We trade each other's secrets on the reg.

22:02.154 --> 22:02.988
See you.

22:04.156 --> 22:05.282
[Frida] What secret?

22:06.408 --> 22:08.994
Uh, it... it doesn't matter.

22:09.077 --> 22:11.330
But it did remind me
that seeing as I don't really know

22:11.413 --> 22:12.664
how things work around here,

22:12.748 --> 22:14.958
I'm awfully lucky
to have you two as friends.

22:15.542 --> 22:19.838
So, from now on, I won't force you to do
anything scary you don't want to.

22:19.921 --> 22:22.841
But we do want to.
We like that about you.

22:22.924 --> 22:25.677
Really? Y-- You, too, David?

22:25.761 --> 22:27.262
I suppose I don't mind,

22:27.346 --> 22:30.349
as long as I get
to have dreams about sweets.

22:30.932 --> 22:32.684
So, got any new adventures planned?

22:33.518 --> 22:35.896
Well, if it's not too boring...

22:36.897 --> 22:39.274
you want to teach me how to ride a bike?

22:41.985 --> 22:43.862
[theme music playing]
