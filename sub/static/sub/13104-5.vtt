DO YOU FEEL MORALLY
SUPERIOR TO ME?

04:17.250 --> 04:19.650

04:22.120 --> 04:24.623
I'M HUMAN, ALL RIGHT?

I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF MONOGAMY

IT'S LIKE SAYING
I'M ONLY GONNA EAT APPLES.

04:58.460 --> 05:00.018
(horn blares in distance)
NOT REALLY.

05:00.060 --> 05:01.493

TRYING TO PROTECT YOUR FAMILY,

07:15.830 --> 07:18.890
BUT THE LONGER YOU STAND HERE
POINTING THAT GUN AT ME,

THE MORE COPS ARE GONNA

(Andy) DANA, PLEASE GET
THE BABY OUT OF HERE. PLEASE!

07:31.510 --> 07:33.341

07:43.060 --> 07:44.425

I DON'T KNOW.

07:44.460 --> 07:46.758
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE GUN
CAME FROM. I SWEAR TO GOD!

07:46.800 --> 07:48.893
SWEAR TO GOD I DIDN'T KNOW
THERE WAS A GUN!

07:52.430 --> 07:55.035

07:58.270 --> 07:59.601
WHAT'S GOING ON
IN THERE FIRST.

07:59.640 --> 08:01.870
TAKE PECK, CHECK THE BACK

08:01.910 --> 08:03.969

I-I GET TOO ANXIOUS.

15:43.470 --> 15:44.664
W--I'M SORRY.

15:44.710 --> 15:46.735
YOU--YOU THINK
SHE WENT MISSING...

15:46.770 --> 15:48.203
IN THE HOUSE?

15:48.240 --> 15:49.639
I KNOW SHE DID.

15:49.680 --> 15:51.773
(radio chatter and static)

15:51.810 --> 15:54.370
(loud clattering)

15:54.420 --> 15:57.617
(radio static and Chatter)
SAMMY! WHAT DO YOU GOT?

15:57.650 --> 15:58.912
WOW.

15:58.950 --> 16:02.818
GLOCKS, .455,
MAC-11 MACHINE PISTOL.

16:02.860 --> 16:04.623
HMM. A COUPLE OF AK-47s.

16:04.660 --> 16:06.389
(Nick) NO, ACTUALLY
THOSE ARE AK-74s.

16:06.430 --> 16:07.727
IT'S AN EASY MISTAKE.

16:07.760 --> 16:09.398
THERE'S A COUPLE OF DIFFERENCES,
BUT THE QUICKEST WAY

16:09.430 --> 16:11.819
TO TELL THEM APART
IS BY THE BULLETS.
(radio static and Chatter)

16:11.870 --> 16:13.269
(clicks tongue)
WHAT?

16:13.300 --> 16:14.335
(radio chatter and static)

16:14.370 --> 16:16.190
WHO HIDES GUNS
IN A KID'S BEDROOM?

16:16.240 --> 16:18.003
HE HAD THE BIGGEST CLOSET.

16:18.040 --> 16:20.531
YEAH, SO WHAT, IS THIS GUY
SELLING GUNS NOW?

16:20.580 --> 16:22.104
AH, HE DIDN'T LOOK LIKE
AN ARMS DEALER.

16:22.140 --> 16:25.303
REALLY? AND WHAT WOULD
AN ARMS DEALER LOOK LIKE?

16:28.150 --> 16:30.482
UH, CONNOR'S TALKING
WITH A COUNSELOR RIGHT NOW.

16:30.520 --> 16:32.147
OBVIOUSLY WE CAN'T
CHARGE HIM WITH ANYTHING--

16:32.190 --> 16:34.351
HE'S 11 YEARS OLD--
BUT HE REALLY NEEDS

16:34.390 --> 16:36.278
TO UNDERSTAND THE SERIOUSNESS
OF HIS ACTIONS.

16:36.320 --> 16:38.151
IS HE OKAY?

16:38.190 --> 16:40.021
CLAIRE, I NEED TO KNOW
IF HE'S OKAY.

16:40.060 --> 16:43.621
HE'S FINE. HE--HE'S UPSET.
HE THINKS IT WAS HIS FAULT.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.490
POOR LI'ITLE GUY.
(fussmg)

16:45.530 --> 16:47.395
LOOK, UH, RICK HAS ACTUALLY
TAKEN FULL RESPONSIBILITY

16:47.440 --> 16:48.930
FOR THE WEAPONS.

16:48.970 --> 16:50.608
HE SAYS THAT DANA HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

16:50.640 --> 16:52.335
OF COURSE DANA HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

16:52.370 --> 16:53.928
I MEAN, SHE'S A FLAKE.
SHE'S NOT AN IDIOT.

16:53.980 --> 16:55.402
WHICH IS WHY
WE'RE LETTING HER GO.

16:55.440 --> 16:57.408
OKAY, GOOD. GOOD.
THAT'S GREAT.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.748
YES, BUT, UH,
FOR THE MOMENT,

16:59.780 --> 17:01.509
ANY TIME SHE SPENDS
WITH THE KIDS

17:01.550 --> 17:03.017
HAS TO BE UNDER
YOUR SUPERVISION.

17:03.050 --> 17:05.712
OH, YOU'RE KIDDING.
DANA IS NEVER GONNA GO FOR THAT.

17:05.750 --> 17:07.718
WELL, SHE HAS TO.

17:07.760 --> 17:11.753
EVA, IF SHE WANTS A CHANCE
OF GE'I'I'ING THEM BACK,

17:11.790 --> 17:14.350
SHE HAS TO LOOK OUT
FOR THEIR BEST INTERESTS.

17:14.400 --> 17:15.719
(Finn babbles)

17:15.760 --> 17:18.399
(indistinct conversations)

17:24.540 --> 17:26.508
(coffee pouring)

17:26.540 --> 17:27.837
(coffeepot clatters)

17:27.880 --> 17:29.006
UNIFORM SUITS YOU.

17:29.040 --> 17:31.577
YEAH, I'M NOT GONNA DO
THE SMALL TALK THING.

17:31.610 --> 17:32.872
(door closes)

17:32.910 --> 17:34.070
FINE. (inhales)

17:34.120 --> 17:36.076
WANNA DO
THE BIG TALK THING?

17:36.120 --> 17:37.610
FINALLY GOT YOU ALONE.

17:37.650 --> 17:39.288
WE MIGHT AS WELL GET IT
ALL OUT IN THE OPEN.

17:39.320 --> 17:41.515
WHAT ARE YOU EVEN
TALKING ABOUT?

17:41.560 --> 17:43.016
COME ON.
(door closes)

17:43.060 --> 17:45.426
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET
IN TOUCH WITH YOU SINCE I LEFI'.

17:45.460 --> 17:47.189
YEAH, I KNOW YOU'VE, UH,

17:47.230 --> 17:48.629
YOU'VE BEEN TRYING
REALLY HARD.

17:48.660 --> 17:49.627
(packet crinkles)

17:49.660 --> 17:51.321
I CALLED YOU EVERY SUNDAY.

17:52.330 --> 17:54.833
EVERY SUNDAY.

17:54.870 --> 17:58.203
YOUR FATHER WOULDN'T
LET ME TALK TO YOU.

17:58.240 --> 18:00.834
MAYBE HE WAS LOOKING OUT
FOR MY BEST INTERESTS, MOM.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.701
THAT SOUNDS SO WEIRD,

18:03.750 --> 18:06.503
IT'S LIKE IT'S NOT EVEN REAL.

18:06.550 --> 18:08.211
"OH, CAN I GET A RIDE
TO SCHOOL TODAY, MOM?"

18:08.250 --> 18:10.514
OR, "MERRY CHRISTMAS, MOM."

18:10.550 --> 18:12.745
ANDY...
I MEAN, I CAN SAY THE WORDS.

18:12.790 --> 18:14.212
THAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM.

18:14.260 --> 18:15.613
IT'S JUST THAT I ACTUALLY HAVE
NO IDEA WHAT THAT MEANS.

18:15.660 --> 18:18.151
YOU KNOW? IT'S LIKE A--
A FOREIGN LANGUAGE.

18:18.190 --> 18:19.987
OKAY, ANDREA--
OKAY. (laughs)

18:20.030 --> 18:23.568
NOT AS FOREIGN AS THAT, THOUGH.
NOBODY CALLS ME THAT.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.158
IT'S NOT MY NAME.

18:25.200 --> 18:27.930
YES, IT IS.

18:27.970 --> 18:30.268
I NAMED YOU
AFI'ER MY BEST FRIEND.

18:31.710 --> 18:34.406
WOW. YOU HAVE
A BEST FRIEND?

18:34.440 --> 18:36.271
KEEP IN TOUCH WITH HER?

18:38.110 --> 18:41.011
(indistinct conversations,
radio chatter)

18:41.050 --> 18:42.574
ALL RIGHT, SO YOU'RE
FREE TO GO.

18:42.620 --> 18:44.986
YOU KNOW WHAT? MY SISTER
HAS FULL CUSTODY OF MY KIDS.

18:45.020 --> 18:46.715
EVERY MOMENT THAT
I'M GONNA BE WITH THEM,

18:46.750 --> 18:48.752
SHE'S GONNA BE WATCHING ME
AND JUDGING ME.

18:48.790 --> 18:51.327
THAT SOUND LIKE FREEDOM
TO YOU?

18:55.400 --> 18:56.822
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US
ABOUT THE GUNS?

18:56.860 --> 18:58.964
WELL, THEY'RE NOT MINE.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.661
I'M HOLDING THEM
FOR SOMEBODY.

19:00.700 --> 19:03.237
WHO ARE YOU
HOLDING THEM FOR?
WHY WOULD I TELL YOU THAT?

19:03.270 --> 19:04.965
WELL, IF YOU COOPERATE,
IT MIGHT HELP YOUR CASE.

19:05.010 --> 19:06.898
(scoffs)

19:06.940 --> 19:08.931
DANA'S GONNA LEAVE ME.

19:08.980 --> 19:11.175
I'M NOT GONNA SEE MY KIDS
FOR YEARS...

19:11.210 --> 19:13.007
EXCEPT THROUGH
A GLASS WINDOW.

19:13.050 --> 19:15.143
IT'S TOO LATE TO FIX IT.

19:15.180 --> 19:17.011
(inhales)

19:17.050 --> 19:19.439
WHAT KIND OF EXAMPLE DO YOU
WANT TO SET FOR YOUR KID?

19:20.760 --> 19:22.648
I'M DONE TALKIN'.

19:26.830 --> 19:28.627
YOU LOOK INTO HIS CONNECTIONS,

19:28.660 --> 19:32.323
AND I'LL SEE IF THEY FOUND
THE SERIAL NUMBERS ON THE GUNS.

19:32.370 --> 19:34.099
(door buzzes and beeps)

19:35.600 --> 19:36.692
(door closes)

19:39.010 --> 19:41.035
I MEAN, HON ESTLY,

19:41.080 --> 19:43.002
YOU NEED ALL THIS STUFF?

19:43.040 --> 19:45.247
KATIE ALWAYS SAYS I HAVE
EVERYTHING I'LL NEED

19:45.280 --> 19:47.168
IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY.

19:47.220 --> 19:49.211
EXCEPT A BULLDOZER.

19:49.250 --> 19:51.389
(bags rustling)

19:53.020 --> 19:54.282
(radio chatter)

19:54.320 --> 19:56.515
THEN AGAIN,
WHO AM I TO JUDGE?

19:57.730 --> 20:00.858
WHAT EXACTLY WAS YOUR WIFE
LOOKING FOR?

20:00.900 --> 20:02.390
HER PINK SUITCASE.

20:02.430 --> 20:04.022
(bags rustling)

20:04.070 --> 20:06.868
DO YOU MIND?
I HAVE TO GO TO...

20:06.900 --> 20:09.334
I NEED--I NEED TO GET
A BREATH.

20:09.370 --> 20:11.008
YE-Y-YES, YOU GO.
RELAX.

20:11.040 --> 20:13.133
IT'S ALL RIGHT. WE'RE GONNA
KEEP LOOKING FOR HER.

20:14.640 --> 20:16.676
HER PINK SUITCASE?

20:16.710 --> 20:19.178
THIS GUY'S LOST HIS NUT.
H-HE'S CLEARLY HAVING US ON.

20:19.210 --> 20:21.246
HIS WIFE HIT HER LIMIT,
DUG HER WAY OUT OF HERE.

20:21.280 --> 20:23.748
OKAY, WELL, CAN'T WE JUST GIVE
HIM THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT?

20:23.790 --> 20:25.382
ALL RIGHT, KEEP--
KEEP WORKING.

20:25.420 --> 20:26.785
HERE.

20:28.590 --> 20:30.558
CHECK THIS OUT.
YEAH?

20:30.590 --> 20:32.683
RICK MOYER.
TWO YEARS AT KINGSTON.

20:32.730 --> 20:34.197
EVERY ONE OF THOSE NAMES
ON THERE

20:34.230 --> 20:35.595
IS SOMEONE WHO WAS THERE
AT THE SAME TIME

20:35.630 --> 20:38.519
ON WEAPONS-RELATED CHARGES.
THAT'S NICE WORK.

20:38.570 --> 20:39.992
I MEAN, HE COULD HAVE
MADE FRIENDS

20:40.030 --> 20:42.066
WITH ANY ONE OF THESE GUYS,
AND NOW HE'S HIDING THEIR GUNS.

20:42.100 --> 20:43.306
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S SEE WHERE THEY ARE

20:43.340 --> 20:44.762
AND WHAT THEY'VE BEEN UP TO.
OKAY.

20:44.810 --> 20:47.335
WE JUST TALKED TO FORENSICS.

20:47.380 --> 20:48.870
THEY RETRIEVED
THE SERIAL NUMBERS

20:48.910 --> 20:50.172
ON ALL SEVEN GUNS.

20:50.210 --> 20:53.008
OKAY. DID YOU GET THE TRACES?
YES, ACTUALLY.

20:53.050 --> 20:54.415
WHAT?

20:54.450 --> 20:56.247
ALL SEVEN OF THESE GUNS
ARE CONNECTED

20:56.280 --> 20:58.214
TO A PARKDALE GANG--
THE DOWLING CREW.

20:58.250 --> 21:00.241
SOUND FAMILIAR?
YEAH, OF COURSE.

21:00.290 --> 21:02.451
I BUSTED THEM FIVE YEARS AGO.
IT WAS A GOOD CASE.

21:02.490 --> 21:05.527
JERRY, YOU SEIZED
THESE GUNS ALREADY.

21:05.560 --> 21:09.155
THEY WERE IN POLICE CUSTODY
AND MARKED FOR DISPOSAL.

21:09.200 --> 21:11.464
WHAT?

21:11.500 --> 21:14.560
WAIT. BUT, UH... HOW'D THEY
GET BACK OUT ON THE STREET?

21:14.600 --> 21:16.568
THAT'S MY QUESTION.

21:17.910 --> 21:19.798
I GOT YOUR SIGNATURE
RIGHT HERE, JERRY,

21:19.840 --> 21:22.331
SAYING THAT YOU WITNESSED
THE DEMOLITION OF THESE GUNS,

21:22.380 --> 21:23.608
SO YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN TO ME
HOW THEY ENDED UP

21:23.650 --> 21:24.742
IN THE BEDROOM
OF AN 11-YEAR-OLD?

21:24.780 --> 21:25.974
TH-THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

21:26.010 --> 21:28.274
IS THAT YOUR SIGNATURE?
YES, IT IS.

21:28.320 --> 21:30.788
DID YOU WITNESS THE DEMOLITION
OF THESE GUNS--YES OR NO?

21:30.820 --> 21:33.186
COME ON, FRANK.
THIS WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

21:33.220 --> 21:35.381
BECAUSE WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE
TO ANY JUDGE OR JURY

21:35.420 --> 21:37.012
IS THAT YOU PRETENDED
TO WITNESS

21:37.060 --> 21:38.459
THE DISPOSAL OF THESE GUNS,

21:38.490 --> 21:41.550
SOLD IT TO SOME GANGBANGER,
AND POCKETED THE MONEY.

21:41.600 --> 21:42.919
YOU KNOW HE WOULDN'T DO THAT.

21:42.960 --> 21:45.360
THEN YOU NEED TO FIND
A WAY TO PROVE IT.

21:45.400 --> 21:47.391
FIX THIS, JERRY.

21:47.440 --> 21:52.264
***

21:52.940 --> 21:54.237
I DIDN'T SELL THOSE GUNS.

21:54.280 --> 21:56.532
OF COURSE YOU DIDN'T.

21:56.580 --> 21:57.979
JERRY, IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

21:58.010 --> 22:00.205
NO, NO, IT'S NOT.

22:00.250 --> 22:02.218
EVEN GET A HINT THAT I'M MESSING
WITH THE EVIDENCE,

22:02.250 --> 22:04.980
THAT COULD COMPROMISE EVERY
SINGLE CASE I EVER WORKED ON.

22:05.020 --> 22:06.612
OKAY. OKAY.
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

22:06.650 --> 22:08.618
YOU SIGNED OFF
ON THE DISPOSAL, RIGHT?
YEAH.

22:08.660 --> 22:10.082
(pages flipping)
WAIT. HOLD ON.

22:10.120 --> 22:12.054
I DIDN'T WITNESS IT.

22:12.090 --> 22:13.455
WHAT? WHY NOT?

22:13.500 --> 22:16.526
HMM?
WHY NOT?

22:17.370 --> 22:19.964
UH... WELL, IT WAS FRIDAY,

22:20.000 --> 22:22.093
AND IT WAS A LONG WEEKEND,
AND I...

22:22.140 --> 22:23.869
I BOOKED THIS TRIP
TO NIAGARA FALLS,

22:23.910 --> 22:26.538
AND WE, UH,
CHECKED IN AT 3:00.

22:27.740 --> 22:30.072
OKAY. SO IT WAS
A ROMANTIC WEEKEND

22:30.110 --> 22:31.099
WITH YOUR WIFE
IN NIAGARA FALLS?

22:31.150 --> 22:32.378
MM-HMM.

22:32.410 --> 22:34.139
NIAGARA FALLS?

22:34.180 --> 22:36.478
REALLY KNOW HOW TO SWEEP
A GIRL OFF HER FEET, HUH?

22:38.520 --> 22:41.910
NANCY CORDEN.
SHE WAS WORKING EVIDENCE.

22:41.960 --> 22:43.382
SHE KNEW
I WAS GONNA BE LATE.

22:43.430 --> 22:45.751
SHE OFFERED TO TAKE
THE GUNS FOR ME.

22:45.790 --> 22:47.519
WOW.

22:47.560 --> 22:49.289
AND I LET HER.
I TRUSTED HER.

22:49.330 --> 22:51.195
SO WE SHOULD TALK TO NANCY.

22:51.230 --> 22:54.563
YOU KNOW WHAT, TRACE?
LET ME HANDLE IT. OKAY?

22:54.600 --> 22:57.433
(cell phone dialing)

22:57.470 --> 23:00.678
TWICE IN ONE DAY.
I'M A LUCKY GUY.

23:00.710 --> 23:02.075
(sniffles)

23:02.110 --> 23:03.646
GUESS WHO I RAN INTO TODAY.

23:03.680 --> 23:05.204
I DON'T KNOW. WHO?

23:05.250 --> 23:06.740
GUESS. (scoffs)

23:06.780 --> 23:08.145
COME ON. GIVE ME A HINT.

23:08.180 --> 23:09.670
DAD.

23:09.720 --> 23:12.644
(birds calling)

23:12.690 --> 23:14.612
(clicks tongue)
YOUR MOTHER?

23:14.660 --> 23:16.412
YEAH.

23:18.590 --> 23:20.649
WHERE'D YOU SEE HER?

23:20.700 --> 23:23.123
MY LAST CALL.
IT WAS A DOMESTIC,

23:23.160 --> 23:25.321
AND SHE WAS
THE SOCIAL WORKER.

23:25.370 --> 23:27.588
SO, WHAT,
SHE'S BACK IN TOWN NOW?

23:27.640 --> 23:30.564
I GUESS SO.

23:30.610 --> 23:32.407
DAD, SHE SAID THAT SHE--

23:32.440 --> 23:33.976
SHE CALLED EVERY WEEK,
YOU KNOW,

23:34.010 --> 23:36.899
TO TRY TO TALK TO ME,
BUT SHE NEVER DID THAT, RIGHT?

23:38.950 --> 23:42.670
YEAH. SHE CALLED.

23:42.720 --> 23:45.416
NOT EVERY WEEK.

23:45.450 --> 23:48.157
I WOULDN'T LET HER
SPEAK TO YOU.

23:48.190 --> 23:49.851
(sighs) I MEAN,
YOU WERE CONFUSED.

23:49.890 --> 23:53.326
YOU WERE A LITTLE KID, AND YOU
NEEDED THINGS TO BE STABLE.

23:53.360 --> 23:54.725
(sighs)

23:55.500 --> 23:56.649
COME ON, HONEY.

23:56.700 --> 24:01.160
SHE LEFT US
FOR SOME HOTSHOT PROFESSOR.

24:01.200 --> 24:03.998
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO,
LET HER RUB IT IN?

24:10.810 --> 24:11.879
(kiss)

24:11.910 --> 24:14.777
GET OFF MY CAR.
I GOTTA GO BACK TO WORK.

24:14.820 --> 24:16.913
DON'T WAIT TILL
MY NEXT BIRTHDAY TO VISIT.

24:16.950 --> 24:19.714
HEY, YOU CAN COME
AND SEE ME ANYTIME, TOO.

24:19.750 --> 24:22.218
NEXT TIME YOU SEE HER,

24:22.260 --> 24:24.387
TELL HER TO GO SUCK AN EGG.
(laughs)

24:24.430 --> 24:26.182
(cell phone rings)
OKAY, I WILL.

24:26.230 --> 24:29.290
(chuckling) BYE.
(ﬁng)

24:29.330 --> 24:32.163
OOH. SPEAK OF THE DEVIL.
(rings and beeps)

24:32.200 --> 24:33.997
HELLO?

24:38.410 --> 24:41.231
OKAY. WHERE ARE THE KIDS?

24:41.280 --> 24:43.077
TALK TO EVA?

24:44.580 --> 24:47.174
OKAY. JUST MEET ME
AT THE STATION. I'M ON MY WAY.

24:47.210 --> 24:48.279
(beeps)

24:50.690 --> 24:53.488
I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE STUCK
AROUND AS LONG AS SHE DID.

24:53.520 --> 24:56.819
IT'S AMAZING WHAT SOME
PEOPLE WILL PUT UP WITH.

24:56.860 --> 24:58.589
THAT'S WHAT
A MARRIAGE IS, MAN.

24:58.630 --> 25:00.655
YOU STICK IT OUT--
THICK AND THIN.

25:00.700 --> 25:02.725
YOU'D KNOW BETTER THAN ME.

25:02.760 --> 25:05.888
(rustling)
(light fixture squeaking)

25:05.930 --> 25:07.659
SHE KICKED ME OUT.

25:07.700 --> 25:10.191
(scoffs) WHO?

25:10.240 --> 25:12.037
ZOE. SHE ASKED ME
TO MOVE OUT.

25:12.070 --> 25:14.231
WHEN? WHY?
(bag rustling)

25:14.280 --> 25:16.373
WORK TOO MUCH,
TALK TOO LITTLE...

25:16.410 --> 25:18.071
ALL THAT.

25:18.110 --> 25:19.543
(rustling and clattering)
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN STAYING?

25:19.580 --> 25:22.811
AT A... CRAPPY MOTEL,
YOU KNOW.

25:22.850 --> 25:24.442
I-I CAN'T STOMACH
LOOKING FOR AN APARTMENT.

25:24.490 --> 25:26.947
HAVE YOU TNC'JD ANYBODY?

25:28.260 --> 25:31.286
I JUST KEEP THINKING
IT'S GONNA CHANGE.

25:31.330 --> 25:32.752
(clears throat)

25:32.790 --> 25:35.224
I'M--I'M REALLY SORRY.

25:37.570 --> 25:39.526
UH, YOU KNOW, I'M--I'M--

25:39.570 --> 25:41.060
SO I THINK I'M GONNA GO
MAKE A COUPLE OF THOSE CALLS,

25:41.100 --> 25:42.567
IN CASE SHE LEFT.

25:42.600 --> 25:44.158
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
YEAH, YEAH.

25:44.210 --> 25:45.404
YEAH, YOU D-DO THAT.

25:45.440 --> 25:46.907
OKAY.

25:54.650 --> 25:56.413
(groans)

25:56.450 --> 25:58.145
ALL RIGHT. OKAY. THANK YOU.

25:58.190 --> 25:59.487

OKAY, WE'RE GONNA USE THE GPS

26:05.460 --> 26:08.054

26:08.100 --> 26:11.194
UH... DANA LET HERSELF IN.
SHE HAS A KEY.

26:11.230 --> 26:13.596
OKAY.
THE BABY WAS SLEEPING.
CONNOR WAS WATCHING TV.

26:13.640 --> 26:15.665
(door buzzes)
I WAS UPSTAIRS
ON THE TELEPHONE,

26:15.700 --> 26:17.759
AND THEN I HEARD
MY CAR START.

26:17.810 --> 26:18.959
SHE EVER DONE THIS BEFORE?

26:19.010 --> 26:21.478
TAKEN OFF IN MY CAR?
NO, THIS IS A NEW ONE.

26:21.510 --> 26:23.899
'CAUSE WE WERE TOLD
BY CHILD PROTECTION SERVICES

26:23.950 --> 26:25.599
THAT SHE WAS
GETTING IT TOGETHER.

26:25.650 --> 26:28.073
YEAH, WELL, SHE PUTS ON
A BIG FRONT FOR CLAIRE.

26:28.120 --> 26:29.849
(sniffles)

26:29.880 --> 26:32.212
SHE'S TERRIFIED
OF LOSING HER KIDS.

26:32.250 --> 26:34.889
(inhales sharply) SHE AND RICK
HAVE BEEN FIGHTING A LOT.

26:34.920 --> 26:36.615

RICK IS DRINKING.

26:38.190 --> 26:39.225
(sniffles) I MEAN,
SHE'S MY SISTER.

26:39.260 --> 26:40.420
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO SAY?

26:40.460 --> 26:42.098
I DIDN'T WANT TO GET HER
IN TROUBLE, BUT...

26:42.130 --> 26:44.166
(inhales sharply)

26:44.200 --> 26:45.861
DANA IS DESPERATE.

26:45.900 --> 26:48.130
AND TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,
I'M WORRIED.

26:48.170 --> 26:49.762
I'M WORRIED WHAT SHE'LL DO
TO THOSE KIDS.

26:49.800 --> 26:51.199
NO. NO.

26:51.240 --> 26:54.232
SHE LOVES THEM.
SHE'S NOT GONNA HURT THEM.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.168
YOU KNOW THAT FOR A FACT?

26:58.150 --> 27:00.072

SATELLITE COMPANY SAYS
THE CAR'S PARKED

DROVE HERE BY MYSELF.

27:50.630 --> 27:52.393

OH. WOW.

CONNOR,

WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT
YOUR MOM AND THE BABY.

28:03.580 --> 28:06.071
CAN YOU PLEASE TELL US
WHERE THEY ARE?

28:06.110 --> 28:07.475
I'M NOT ALLOWED TO SAY.

28:07.510 --> 28:08.977
COME ON, CONNOR.
YOU CAN TALK TO THE POLICE.

28:09.020 --> 28:11.318
NO, I CAN'T.

28:11.350 --> 28:13.887
OKAY. GET OUT OF THE CAR.

28:13.920 --> 28:15.319
YOU GO WITH PECK.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.248

WHAT ARE YOU,
SOME KIND OF SUPER KID?

28:22.260 --> 28:25.661
DRIVING CARS, SHOOTING GUNS,
KEEPING SECRETS.

28:25.700 --> 28:28.430
YOU WANNA RIDE UP FRONT?

28:28.470 --> 28:31.928
YEAH, FUNNY. THIS SIDE.

28:35.080 --> 28:37.435
YOU KNOW, UH,
DETECTIVE JERRY BARBER, RIGHT?

28:37.480 --> 28:40.142
OF COURSE. AND I KNOW
THAT YOU'RE HIS GIRL.

28:40.180 --> 28:42.876
(indistinct conversations)

28:42.920 --> 28:45.980
DO YOU REMEMBER SOME GUNS
THAT WERE SEIZED,

28:46.020 --> 28:49.456
UM, FROM THE DOWLING CREW
ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO?

28:49.490 --> 28:51.355
I MAY HAVE SEEN IT ALL
AND DONE IT ALL

28:51.390 --> 28:52.948
AND KNOW IT ALL,
BUT... I'M OLD.

28:52.990 --> 28:54.890
I DON'T ALWAYS
REMEMBER IT ALL.

28:54.930 --> 28:56.750
(chuckles)
WE WERE JUST--

28:56.800 --> 28:59.223
WE'RE TRYING TO TRACE,
UM, SOME GUNS.

28:59.270 --> 29:01.989
UH... THE GANG MEMBERS
WERE CONVICTED,

29:02.040 --> 29:04.531
AND, UH, THE GUNS WERE
SEIZED BY JERRY.

29:04.570 --> 29:07.733
LOGGED AS EVIDENCE, DOCUMENTED,
PRESENTED AT TRIAL.

29:07.780 --> 29:11.272
AND THE GUNS WOULD HAVE BEEN
RETURNED HERE.

29:11.310 --> 29:14.871
WE KEEP THE GUNS FOR TWO YEARS.
DEPARTMENT POLICY.

29:14.920 --> 29:17.241
THEN WE MARK THEM
FOR DISPOSAL.

29:17.280 --> 29:19.419
AND JERRY WOULD HAVE
GONE ALONG TO WITNESS THAT,

29:19.450 --> 29:21.418
CORRECT?
YES.

29:22.460 --> 29:24.678
AND NO ONE COULD HAVE
DONE THAT IN HIS PLACE?

29:24.730 --> 29:27.483
YOU COULDN'T HAVE GONE
IN HIS PLACE?

29:27.530 --> 29:29.054
NO.

29:30.660 --> 29:32.025
ANYTHING ELSE, DETECTIVE?

29:32.070 --> 29:35.062
NO. THANK YOU.

29:39.310 --> 29:40.629
(indistinct conversations)
MM-HMM.

29:40.670 --> 29:42.137

TO NANCY CORDEN.

29:42.180 --> 29:44.569
SHE IS LYING OUT HER ASS.

29:44.610 --> 29:46.077
I TOLD YOU I WAS
DEALING WITH IT.

29:46.110 --> 29:48.044
YEAH, BUT... (scoffs)
JERRY, IT'S FINE.

29:48.080 --> 29:50.116

YOU WERE AWAY THAT WEEKEND.

29:50.150 --> 29:52.243
AS LONG AS YOUR EX CAN
CORROBORATE THE STORY...

29:52.290 --> 29:54.315
(sighs) OKAY.

29:55.590 --> 29:57.979
UM... (Clicks tongue)

29:58.030 --> 30:00.351
I WASN'T WITH MY WIFE.

30:00.390 --> 30:01.721
WHO WERE YOU WITH?

30:03.830 --> 30:05.991
OH, MY GOD.

30:07.600 --> 30:09.431
YOU WERE HAVING AN AFFAIR?

30:09.470 --> 30:11.700
THAT'S WHY YOUR WIFE
LEFT YOU?

30:11.740 --> 30:13.264
WELL, SHE DIDN'T LOVE ME.
YOU KNOW?

30:13.310 --> 30:15.505
AND I DIDN'T LOVE HER.
OKAY.

30:15.540 --> 30:17.633
OKAY. WELL, THEN YOU BETTER
FIND THIS OTHER WOMAN

30:17.680 --> 30:20.604
AND MAKE SURE
SHE CAN VOUCH FOR YOU.

30:20.650 --> 30:22.379

'CAUSE I WANTED
TO FIND DAD.

30:52.250 --> 30:54.514
MOM WASN'T MAKING ANY SENSE.

30:54.550 --> 30:58.418
WAS SHE TAKING
TOO MUCH MEDICINE?

30:58.450 --> 30:59.849
I GUESS.

30:59.890 --> 31:01.778
(sighs) ALL RIGHT.

31:01.820 --> 31:03.811

TIME'S UP, CONNOR.

I WANT TO SEE DAD.

31:08.330 --> 31:10.491
OKAY, WELL, MAYBE
IF YOU COOPERATE,

31:10.530 --> 31:12.361
THEY'LL LET YOU TALK TO HIM
FOR A LITTLE BIT.

31:14.370 --> 31:16.759

HARD TO BELIEVE THAT
SOME KIDS ARE BETTER OFF

32:50.360 --> 32:52.123
WITHOUT THEIR MOTHERS.

32:52.170 --> 32:53.489
SOMETIMES IT'S TRUE.

YOUR GUN.

YOU TOLD ME TO LEAVE
THE CLOSET ALONE.

33:29.640 --> 33:31.369

IT WAS CHRISTMAS PRESENTS

BEFORE YOU DO.

33:45.520 --> 33:47.078
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

33:47.120 --> 33:50.487
IT MEANS THAT
YOU ARE AN AMAZING KID,

33:50.520 --> 33:52.385
AND, LOOK, I'M GONNA HELP
THE POLICE, OKAY?

33:52.430 --> 33:54.728
WHATEVER THEY NEED TO KNOW,
I'M GONNA TELL 'EM,

34:18.990 --> 34:23.211
MY FRIEND, UH, IS OUTSIDE MAKING
A FEW PHONE CALLS, EUGENE...

34:23.260 --> 34:24.386
(clatters)

34:24.430 --> 34:27.888
BECAUSE, UH, WE NEED
TO THINK--

34:27.930 --> 34:28.897
(clatters)

34:28.930 --> 34:29.999
(creaking)
WE NEED TO START THINKING

34:30.030 --> 34:31.361
ABOUT WHERE ELSE
YOUR WIFE MIGHT HAVE GONE.

34:31.400 --> 34:33.698
SHE WOULDN'T LEAVE
WITHOUT TELLING ME.

34:33.730 --> 34:34.890
(object clatters)

34:34.940 --> 34:37.067
WE'VE BEEN MARRIED
FOR 55 YEARS. REMEMBER?

34:37.100 --> 34:39.136
WELL, THIS, UH...

34:39.170 --> 34:40.535
THIS CAN BE TOUGH
ON A MARRIAGE.

34:40.570 --> 34:41.798
YOU MIGHT THINK THE FACT

34:41.840 --> 34:43.273
THAT I COLLECT THINGS...
(objects thudding and Clinking)

34:43.310 --> 34:44.402
IS A LITTLE STRANGE.

34:44.450 --> 34:47.806
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT JUST
A COLLECTOR, PAL.

34:47.850 --> 34:50.478
YOU HAVE
A COMPULSIVE CONDITION, UH,

34:50.520 --> 34:52.818
AND YOU NEED SERIOUS HELP,
BECAUSE NO ONE--

34:52.850 --> 34:53.817
NO ONE COULD PUT UP
WITH THIS.

34:53.850 --> 34:56.284
(clatters)
BUT SHE LOVES ME.

34:56.320 --> 34:57.856
SOMETIMES LOVE DON'T CUT IT.

35:00.360 --> 35:02.089
(clatters)

35:04.730 --> 35:06.994
(clatters, plastic rustling)

35:07.030 --> 35:09.897
(clatters)

35:09.940 --> 35:12.101
(voice breaking)
OH, MY GOD.

35:12.140 --> 35:15.769
(panﬁng)

35:15.810 --> 35:17.334
KATIE.

35:19.910 --> 35:21.377
(whispers) YEAH.

35:21.420 --> 35:22.375
(radio static)

35:22.420 --> 35:24.217
THIS IS 1503.
I'M AT 37 PENDER.

35:24.250 --> 35:25.547
I NEED AN AMBULANCE.

35:25.590 --> 35:26.545
(static)

35:26.590 --> 35:29.684
KATIE.

35:29.720 --> 35:32.723
(indistinct conversations,
telephones ringing in distance)

35:32.760 --> 35:35.058
FRANK'S, UH, QUESTIONING
NANCY NOW.

35:35.100 --> 35:36.055
THAT'S GOOD.

35:36.100 --> 35:38.022
(sighs)

35:38.060 --> 35:39.527
YEAH.

35:39.570 --> 35:41.299
YOU KNOW,
SHE'S BEEN HERE 20 YEARS.

35:41.340 --> 35:44.639
I MEAN, I'VE--I'VE KNOWN HER
MY ENTIRE CAREER.

35:44.670 --> 35:45.967
WELL, SHE WAS ALL TOO HAPPY
TO LET YOU

35:46.010 --> 35:47.136
TAKE THE FALL FOR HER,

35:47.170 --> 35:50.628
SO I WOULDN'T FEEL THAT BAD
ABOUT IT.

35:50.680 --> 35:53.148
TRACI, UH... (sighs)

35:54.650 --> 35:55.969
THINGS ARE DIFFERENT.

35:56.020 --> 35:57.169
(radio chatter)

35:57.220 --> 36:00.189
I'M HAPPY NOW.
I WOULDN'T CHEAT ON YOU.

36:00.220 --> 36:01.710
I WOULD NEVER CHEAT ON YOU.

36:05.230 --> 36:06.982
YOU TURNED ME
INTO AN ELEPHANT.

36:12.500 --> 36:14.127
I GUESS
WE'RE BOTH ELEPHANTS.

36:14.170 --> 36:15.694
MM-HMM.

36:28.420 --> 36:31.480
HEY, GAIL.
CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SEC?

36:31.520 --> 36:33.886
UH...

36:33.920 --> 36:35.979
MEET YOU OUT BACK?

36:36.020 --> 36:38.329
(indistinct conversations)

36:38.360 --> 36:39.987
YEAH?

36:40.030 --> 36:43.090
(sighs) I MEAN, NOW THAT ALL
THIS TIME HAS PASSED,

36:43.130 --> 36:46.691
UH, YOU KNOW, THAT WHOLE THING
BETWEEN YOU AND DOV--

36:46.730 --> 36:49.369
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE SUCH
A BIG DEAL ANYMORE.

36:51.610 --> 36:53.828
I-I SHOULD HAVE TRUSTED YOU.

36:54.910 --> 36:56.639
(sighs)

36:56.680 --> 36:59.478
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU THIS.

36:59.510 --> 37:01.717
UH... (sighs)

37:01.750 --> 37:06.210
WE WERE GONNA GET MARRIED--
ME AND NICK--

37:06.250 --> 37:08.559
AND THEN NICK BACKED OUT
AT THE LAST MINUTE,

37:08.590 --> 37:12.879
AND I'VE--I'VE JUST, LIKE,
HATED HIM FOR IT,

37:12.930 --> 37:16.650
AND NOW HE'S HERE, AND I'M--
ALL THIS TIME HAS PASSED,

37:16.700 --> 37:18.497
AND I'M JUST TRYING
TO FIGURE THINGS OUT.

37:18.530 --> 37:20.361
WELL, I HOPE THAT WORKS OUT.

37:20.400 --> 37:22.368
(sighs)

37:22.400 --> 37:24.868
UH...

37:24.910 --> 37:27.561
(chuckles)
HAVE A—-HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

37:27.610 --> 37:28.577

37:28.610 --> 37:30.771
(radio chatter)

37:30.810 --> 37:32.505
I'M SORRY.

37:32.550 --> 37:34.370
NO, DON'T.
DON'T FEEL SORRY FOR ME.

37:34.420 --> 37:36.115
I DON'T FEEL--I'M NOT F--
NO, LOOK.

37:36.150 --> 37:38.641
THERE ARE PLENTY OF OPTIONS.

37:38.690 --> 37:41.557
YOU WERE ONE OF THEM.
NOW YOU'RE NOT.

37:48.190 --> 37:51.466
(siren wailing in distance)

37:51.500 --> 37:52.660
(gearshift Clicks)

37:57.600 --> 37:59.966
YEAH, W-WE HAVE A COUCH.

38:00.010 --> 38:01.204
WE DON'T HAVE
ANY EXTRA BLANKETS,

38:01.240 --> 38:04.073
BUT... WE GOT
SOME BIG TOWELS.

38:04.110 --> 38:05.771
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

38:05.810 --> 38:07.573
I THINK I'D RATHER
SHOOT MYSELF IN THE ASS.

38:07.610 --> 38:10.272
YOU SURE? I MEAN, A MOTEL
SOUNDS PRETTY GRIM.

38:10.320 --> 38:12.515
I'M GOING THROUGH A BREAKUP
WITH MY WIFE, DUDE.

38:12.550 --> 38:15.451
GRIM... IS THE ONLY OPTION.

38:17.890 --> 38:19.426
YOU THINK ZOE'S GONNA WANT
TO PATCH THINGS UP?

38:19.460 --> 38:22.395
OH, I DON'T KNOW. PROBABLY.

38:22.430 --> 38:24.660
YOU KNOW--
YOU KNOW WOMEN, RIGHT?

38:24.700 --> 38:25.860

38:29.400 --> 38:30.367
(sniffles)

38:30.400 --> 38:32.539
(sighs)

38:32.570 --> 38:36.438
OH, WAIT. DON'T YOU HAVE
A FANCY DATE PLANNED

38:36.480 --> 38:37.708
WITH YOUR E.T.F. GIRLFRIEND,

BACK ON THE JOB?

38:39.480 --> 38:41.471
I WISH I FELT LIKE IT.

38:41.520 --> 38:44.819
I THOUGHT GOING BACK TO WORK
WOULD MAKE ME FEEL NORMAL,

38:44.850 --> 38:49.458
BUT... I DON'T KNOW.

38:49.490 --> 38:52.220
I KILLED SOMEBODY.
THAT'S ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT.

38:53.390 --> 38:55.824

38:55.860 --> 38:57.498

39:23.260 --> 39:24.215
(notebook thuds)

39:24.260 --> 39:26.581
(sighs)

39:28.760 --> 39:31.729
(indistinct conversations,
telephones ringing in distance)

39:38.270 --> 39:40.932
YOU SAID YOU HAD
TO MOVE BACK. WHY?

39:42.580 --> 39:44.548
WHY NOW?

39:44.580 --> 39:45.649
(sighs)

39:48.050 --> 39:52.544
15 YEARS AGO,
I WANTED TO TAKE YOU.

39:52.590 --> 39:55.058
I BEGGED YOU TO COME
WITH ME.

39:55.090 --> 39:56.580
YOU CHOSE TO STAY.

39:56.620 --> 39:58.053
I WAS 12.

39:58.090 --> 39:59.523
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

39:59.560 --> 40:03.553
EVEN WHEN YOU WERE 12,
THERE WAS NO CHANGING YOUR MIND.

40:03.600 --> 40:06.023
ANDY, I CALLED EVERY WEEK.

40:06.070 --> 40:10.029
I WANTED YOU TO LIVE WITH ME,
TO VISIT, ANYTHING...

40:10.070 --> 40:13.369
(sighs)
BUT YOUR DAD HAD CUSTODY,

40:13.410 --> 40:14.775
AND HE CALLED THE SHOTS.

40:15.810 --> 40:17.175
SO THEN WHY DID YOU LEAVE?

40:17.210 --> 40:19.178
(inhales deeply)

40:19.210 --> 40:20.575
(voice breaking)
YOUR DAD WAS GOOD TO YOU,

40:20.610 --> 40:22.214
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS
LIKE TO BE MARRIED TO HIM.

40:22.250 --> 40:23.877
DON'T.

40:23.920 --> 40:26.388
YOU DON'T GET TO TALK
ABOUT HIM.

40:26.420 --> 40:28.718
DAD DID
THE JOB OF TWO PEOPLE.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.489
(voice breaking)
IF THERE IS ANYTHING

40:30.520 --> 40:32.556
I'VE EVER LEARNED
IN MY LIFE,

40:32.590 --> 40:34.490
IT'S THAT
I WAS NEVER BETTER OFF

40:34.530 --> 40:36.498
WITHOUT MY MOTHER.

40:38.530 --> 40:39.497
I'M SORRY.

40:39.530 --> 40:40.861
YEAH.

40:44.940 --> 40:46.635

40:46.670 --> 40:48.137

40:48.170 --> 40:50.638
CAN WE JUST HAVE DINNER?

40:52.680 --> 40:54.204
I CAN DO COFFEE.

40:55.220 --> 40:57.814
(William Fitzsimmons'

40:57.850 --> 40:59.215
(buzzer)

41:01.450 --> 41:02.553
(door closes)

41:08.090 --> 41:11.253
HEY, CAN WE--CAN WE JUST SIT
FOR A MINUTE?

41:11.300 --> 41:12.619
I-I JUST--I NEED TO SIT.

41:12.670 --> 41:13.864
OKAY.

41:13.900 --> 41:18.701
* DOESN'T IT FEEL LIKE
RAIN TODAY? *

41:18.740 --> 41:19.707
(horn honks in distance)

41:19.740 --> 41:21.708
(clears throat)
YOU READ MY MIND.

41:21.740 --> 41:22.707
(chuckles)

41:22.740 --> 41:27.541
* I THINK WE WALK *

41:27.580 --> 41:29.719
YOU KNOW THAT
MY FULL NAME IS ANDREA?

41:29.750 --> 41:30.717
REALLY?

41:30.750 --> 41:31.717
MM-HMM.

41:31.750 --> 41:33.547
THAT MAKES SENSE.

41:33.590 --> 41:35.888
YEAH, I WAS NAMED AFTER
MY MOTHER'S BEST FRIEND,

41:35.920 --> 41:37.558
WHOEVER THAT IS.

41:37.590 --> 41:39.649
* IN SLOWER RHYTHM *

41:39.690 --> 41:41.351
WELL, I'M JUST GONNA STICK
WITH "MCNALLY,"

41:41.390 --> 41:43.051
IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU.

41:43.100 --> 41:45.796
* I LIKE YOU LIKE NO ONE ELSE *

41:45.830 --> 41:46.797
PROMISE ME SOMETHING.

41:46.830 --> 41:47.797
* EVER COULD *

41:47.830 --> 41:49.331
GO.

41:50.640 --> 41:52.301
* DO YOU? *

41:52.340 --> 41:55.138
(sighs)
IF THINGS GO SOUTH WITH US,

41:55.180 --> 41:57.307
YOU KNOW, I--
AND H DON'T WANT THEM TO.

41:57.340 --> 41:58.648
I-I HOPE THEY DON'T,
BUT IF THEY DO,

41:58.680 --> 42:04.038
THEN DON'T--DON'T JUST WALK
OUT THE DOOR, OKAY?

42:04.080 --> 42:06.310
LET'S PROMISE TO WORK
AT IT.

42:06.350 --> 42:08.557
YOU WON'T GET RID OF ME
WITHOUT A FIGHT.

42:08.590 --> 42:13.380
* ...FOR THE SKY TO FALL? *

42:13.430 --> 42:14.988
ALL RIGHT.

42:15.030 --> 42:16.554
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?
NOPE.

42:16.600 --> 42:21.025
* ...FOR THE SKY TO FALL? *
