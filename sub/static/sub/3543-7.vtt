WEBVTT

00:01.796 --> 00:03.630
Stefan: Mystic Falls...
I was born here.

00:03.632 --> 00:04.931
This is my home.

00:04.933 --> 00:08.134
Damon: And mine.
Elena: And mine.

00:08.135 --> 00:11.021
For centuries, supernatural
creatures have lived among us.

00:11.023 --> 00:13.973
Caroline: They were vampires,
werewolves, doppelgangers...

00:13.975 --> 00:16.026
Bonnie: Witches.
Klaus: And even hybrids.

00:16.027 --> 00:18.778
Elena: I'm one of them
now... a vampire,

00:18.780 --> 00:20.463
and everything I used
to feel has changed.

00:20.465 --> 00:23.500
Feelings for him
have been magnified.

00:23.502 --> 00:26.052
I can't do this,
Elena... not anymore.

00:26.054 --> 00:27.504
I know.

00:27.506 --> 00:29.489
Her brother is
the key to finding the cure.

00:29.491 --> 00:31.007
Connor: I call this
a hunter's Mark.

00:31.009 --> 00:32.809
The more I kill,
the more it grows.

00:32.811 --> 00:34.928
It's invisible to
anyone but another hunter.

00:34.930 --> 00:36.046
And I will stop
at nothing...

00:36.048 --> 00:37.013
Aah!

00:37.015 --> 00:39.049
To make her human again.

00:41.168 --> 00:42.802
Caroline: What do you mean,
you're not coming?

00:42.804 --> 00:44.554
I don't need to
remind you

00:44.556 --> 00:47.190
that your miss Mystic Falls
attendance record totally sucks.

00:47.192 --> 00:48.341
Besides,
you're a founding family member.

00:48.343 --> 00:50.527
By definition,
you have to be here.

00:50.529 --> 00:52.028
Stefan: Elena and I
broke up.

00:52.030 --> 00:54.064
By definition,
I don't need to be anywhere.

00:54.066 --> 00:56.533
Did that sound as depressing
to you as it did to me?

00:56.535 --> 00:57.868
I'm not depressed.

00:57.870 --> 01:00.120
I just want to rip
into someone's artery

01:00.122 --> 01:03.657
and feed until I can't
breathe anymore.

01:03.659 --> 01:06.376
Well, you can't.
As your sober sponsor,

01:06.378 --> 01:07.878
I'm not going to
let that happen.

01:07.880 --> 01:10.046
Try and sublimate.

01:11.799 --> 01:14.417
She said she has
feelings for Damon.

01:15.253 --> 01:16.753
What?

01:16.755 --> 01:18.421
She can't have
feelings for Damon.

01:18.423 --> 01:19.756
He's... Damon,

01:19.758 --> 01:23.677
and you're you,
and I'm...

01:23.679 --> 01:25.345
Revolted.

01:25.347 --> 01:27.230
You know, I'm gonna
talk to her.

01:27.232 --> 01:30.734
I'm going to shake some sense
into her clearly diseased brain.

01:30.736 --> 01:32.485
Yeah, well,
I don't know what good that'll do.

01:32.487 --> 01:33.687
Elena's right.

01:33.689 --> 01:35.488
Being a vampire
really has changed her.

01:35.490 --> 01:38.024
All the more reason
you need to cure her.

01:40.894 --> 01:42.061
Look, I got to go.

01:42.063 --> 01:43.896
Be careful
and remember,

01:43.898 --> 01:46.449
there's sublimating
and then there's insanity.

01:46.451 --> 01:48.752
I'll be fine. Bye.

01:54.342 --> 01:56.176
In what world do
the words "tell no one" mean

01:56.178 --> 01:58.595
"tell your brother and every
teenage sycophant in town"?

01:58.597 --> 02:00.046
The secret's safe.

02:00.048 --> 02:02.132
No one who knows about
the cure would endanger us.

02:02.134 --> 02:04.417
Trust me. You know I want to
find it more than anyone else.

02:04.419 --> 02:06.970
Well, then I suggest you find
some vampires for Jeremy to kill

02:06.972 --> 02:10.889
before I'm tempted to
offer you up as a victim.

02:10.892 --> 02:13.393
And try to keep this one
to yourself, would you?

02:20.067 --> 02:21.434
Damon:
Where have you been?

02:21.436 --> 02:23.903
Oh, you know. Out.

02:23.905 --> 02:24.904
Damon: Where you going?

02:24.906 --> 02:25.956
Out.

02:25.958 --> 02:28.792
Ok. I see shady
Stefan is back.

02:30.628 --> 02:32.779
Please don't tell me that you're
still working with Klaus.

02:32.781 --> 02:34.414
You obviously
haven't heard.

02:34.416 --> 02:36.583
Elena and I
broke up.

02:39.136 --> 02:40.587
Oh.

02:42.623 --> 02:45.458
Got it. Uh, well,
I'll be quick, then.

02:45.460 --> 02:47.477
So apparently if
we want to find the cure,

02:47.479 --> 02:48.728
we have to find
a vampire hunter

02:48.730 --> 02:50.146
who can kill
enough vampires

02:50.148 --> 02:52.265
to reveal the map
on the hunter's Mark.

02:52.267 --> 02:56.636
Now, unless we want Jeremy
to go all Connor 2.0,

02:56.638 --> 02:58.805
I suggest we find
a different hunter.

02:58.807 --> 03:00.473
Ok. And?

03:00.475 --> 03:02.275
And I was gonna
ask Professor Shane,

03:02.277 --> 03:04.761
but it turns out he's
shadier than you are.

03:04.763 --> 03:06.663
Matt Donovan connected
him and the pastor

03:06.665 --> 03:08.448
through phone
records.

03:08.450 --> 03:09.866
Apparently the two
were very chatty

03:09.868 --> 03:11.651
the day that the pastor
blew up the council.

03:11.653 --> 03:14.537
Ah. So you're gonna
confront Shane,

03:14.539 --> 03:17.156
threaten him, possibly kill him...
that sort of thing?

03:17.158 --> 03:18.708
Yeah, unless he tells
me what he's up to.

03:18.710 --> 03:20.343
What do you say?

03:20.345 --> 03:22.045
We tag team?

03:22.047 --> 03:23.496
Nah.

03:23.498 --> 03:24.664
I'd say
you're on your own.

03:24.666 --> 03:27.500
Or we could just
blow it off, then...

03:27.502 --> 03:29.519
go get drunk,

03:29.521 --> 03:31.671
brother-Bond
over some tridelts

03:31.673 --> 03:33.973
if you...

03:33.975 --> 03:37.060
You know, want
some quality time.

03:40.131 --> 03:44.183
Let's not pretend like
this isn't the best day

03:44.185 --> 03:46.352
of your life.

03:50.691 --> 03:52.375
[Door closes]

03:54.712 --> 03:57.080
I'm your best friend,
and I would never pick sides,

03:57.082 --> 03:59.799
but are you sure
that this is what you want?

03:59.801 --> 04:03.202
Because Stefan
is your soul mate.

04:03.204 --> 04:05.889
Sorry. Picking sides.

04:05.891 --> 04:07.874
It's not like I don't
love Stefan anymore,

04:07.876 --> 04:10.927
but I can't deny
that ever since I turned,

04:10.929 --> 04:14.547
my feelings for Damon
have become more intense.

04:14.549 --> 04:15.849
Yeah, I know.
Stefan filled me in

04:15.851 --> 04:17.851
on all the gory
Damon details.

04:17.853 --> 04:19.719
He did?

04:21.387 --> 04:22.405
Is he ok?

04:22.407 --> 04:24.056
No. He's heartbroken.

04:24.058 --> 04:26.076
Well, what was I supposed to do?
Lie to him?

04:26.078 --> 04:27.827
No, but you weren't
supposed to let Damon

04:27.829 --> 04:30.447
weasel his way into
your confused newbie vampire heart.

04:30.449 --> 04:34.951
Well, he did, and that's
exactly what I am... confused.

04:34.953 --> 04:39.255
I need to figure out what
these feelings actually mean.

04:39.257 --> 04:42.926
Excuse me.
I'm a little lost.

04:42.928 --> 04:44.594
I'm here to interview
contestants.

04:44.596 --> 04:46.262
You're
Professor Shane?

04:46.264 --> 04:48.598
Yeah, that's right...
Professor by day,

04:48.600 --> 04:51.101
pageant judge
by other day.

04:51.103 --> 04:52.635
In spite of being
absurdly unqualified,

04:52.637 --> 04:54.554
I'm apparently
awarding a scholarship?

04:54.556 --> 04:55.605
Inside by
the parlor.

04:55.607 --> 04:57.089
Right here?
Mm-hmm.

04:57.091 --> 04:58.224
All right. I'll just
follow the scent

04:58.226 --> 04:59.926
of hair spray
and world domination.

04:59.928 --> 05:01.544
[Chuckles]

05:02.980 --> 05:04.597
He's the one
who told Damon

05:04.599 --> 05:06.232
how to break
the hunter's curse.

05:06.234 --> 05:08.284
He's also the one
that has Bonnie so obsessed

05:08.286 --> 05:09.435
with practicing
magic

05:09.437 --> 05:11.270
that she bailed
on pageant prep.

05:11.272 --> 05:14.140
And now he's judging
miss Mystic Falls?

05:14.142 --> 05:18.128
Jack of all trades
or kind of creepy?

05:18.130 --> 05:20.880
Matt: So your sister's
making me be her date.

05:20.882 --> 05:22.665
Do I have to do
that weird dance thing?

05:22.667 --> 05:25.385
I'm pretty sure that's
just for the contestants.

05:25.387 --> 05:29.172
I heard that you're April's escort.
How'd that happen?

05:29.174 --> 05:32.926
She needed a date,
and apparently you were taken.

05:37.681 --> 05:40.016
Uh. Ok, let's just
take these,

05:40.018 --> 05:41.351
and we'll come back
for the kegs.

05:41.353 --> 05:42.986

How did you
just do that?

05:59.153 --> 06:00.670
Ever since I was
"awoken" as a hunter,

06:00.672 --> 06:04.257
I've had all this energy,
like all the time.

06:04.259 --> 06:06.092
Jer, I think you need to
talk to someone about this.

06:06.094 --> 06:08.511
I mean, look what
happened to Connor, ok?

06:08.513 --> 06:09.996
A by-product
of this energy

06:09.998 --> 06:11.998
is that you're gonna
want to kill vampires,

06:12.000 --> 06:15.001
and you happen
to live with one.

06:15.003 --> 06:17.937
Hey, I would never
hurt my sister.

06:17.939 --> 06:19.639
I'll be fine.

with me.

Who are you?

Why is there
a cop outside?

07:18.867 --> 07:20.416
I'm a convicted
murderer.

07:20.418 --> 07:21.618
Are you guilty?

07:21.620 --> 07:22.619
Of course I am.

07:22.621 --> 07:23.670
Any regrets?

07:23.672 --> 07:25.622
Only that I
got caught.

of time to memorize.

07:42.924 --> 07:44.557
Yeah. Thank you.

07:46.110 --> 07:49.195
Now, how did I know I'd find
you at the helm of this ship?

07:49.197 --> 07:51.314
Go away. I'm busy.

07:51.316 --> 07:53.766
I was wondering what time
I should pick you up tomorrow.

07:53.768 --> 07:56.602
About a quarter
to never.

07:56.604 --> 07:58.871
I was promised
a date

07:58.873 --> 08:00.623
in return for
one of my hybrids.

08:00.625 --> 08:02.158
Yes, a date,
like to a movie,

08:02.160 --> 08:03.609
where we don't
have to talk

08:03.611 --> 08:05.778
and I can put at least
3 seats between us.

08:05.780 --> 08:07.797
Surely the reigning
miss Mystic Falls

won't be hosting
the party alone.

you're not taking Tyler...

08:24.316 --> 08:26.149

have a dress,

me so much as a corsage.

be like this?

to turn every full moon.

to be grateful for.

what's going on here

isn't torture enough?

your clothes

from the dry cleaners.

10:18.179 --> 10:20.129
They should be hanging
on your door.

you'd stop acting

still my sister.

How do you wake up
with a knife in your hand

10:59.692 --> 11:01.024
and not remember
how it got there?

11:01.026 --> 11:02.492
It's that hunter's
Mark, jer.

11:02.494 --> 11:04.394
It's messing
with you.

11:04.396 --> 11:06.113
What if I'm turning
into Alaric?

11:06.115 --> 11:08.248
I probably died too many times
with this ring on my finger,

11:08.250 --> 11:12.252
and I'm developing an alter ego,
like he did.

11:12.254 --> 11:15.455
"Newly awakened hunters
may not be fully conscious

11:15.457 --> 11:16.873
"of their actions.

11:16.875 --> 11:19.042
"Their subconscious
pushes through

11:19.044 --> 11:22.462
until the urge becomes
a basic instinct."

11:23.698 --> 11:26.350
You're not having
a psychotic break, jer.

11:26.352 --> 11:29.586
You either tell Elena,
or I will.

11:31.222 --> 11:32.806
Fine.

11:33.808 --> 11:35.592
I'll tell her
when I see her.

11:35.594 --> 11:37.144
[Beep beep]

11:39.731 --> 11:41.148
All right. We should
probably get going.

11:41.150 --> 11:43.150
Need a ride?

11:43.152 --> 11:45.986
Uh, no. Go ahead.
I'll meet you there.

11:45.988 --> 11:47.621
All right.

11:52.744 --> 11:54.011
Blue.
Blue.

11:54.013 --> 11:56.413
Really? The blue seems
a little safe.

11:56.415 --> 11:59.499
Safe is good when it
comes to the judges.

11:59.501 --> 12:00.784
She's right.

12:00.786 --> 12:02.636
Gracie lockwood had
a 3-foot slit her year

12:02.638 --> 12:05.289
and practically got
laughed off the court.

12:05.291 --> 12:06.256
[Laughs]

12:06.258 --> 12:08.175
She got my vote.

12:08.177 --> 12:10.510
Get out, lurker.

12:10.512 --> 12:12.095
Ouch.

12:12.097 --> 12:13.480
Where's Professor
Shane?

12:13.482 --> 12:15.265
Check the judges' table.

12:20.021 --> 12:22.189
Red one, definitely.

12:22.191 --> 12:26.142
We've already agreed that the red
one's a little bit too showy.

12:26.144 --> 12:27.744
It's a pageant.
That's the whole point.

12:27.746 --> 12:30.330
Did you win miss
mystic last year?

12:30.332 --> 12:31.981
No. I don't think
you did.

12:31.983 --> 12:34.984
Neither did Elena,
and she wore blue.

12:34.986 --> 12:36.837
Caroline:
Nobody cares what you think.

12:36.839 --> 12:38.288
I care.

12:38.290 --> 12:41.541
See? April cares.
Red, right, Elena?

12:43.160 --> 12:45.462
The red is pretty.

12:47.432 --> 12:50.350
And my work here
is done.

12:51.769 --> 12:55.004
Caroline:
Uh, what happened to 30 seconds ago

12:55.006 --> 12:56.606
when you hated
the red one?

12:56.608 --> 12:59.175
What happened to
"safe is good"?

13:03.180 --> 13:06.316
Whichever one
you want to wear, April.

13:12.590 --> 13:14.408
What just happened?

13:16.077 --> 13:17.828
Damon.

13:19.547 --> 13:21.698
Still here.

13:27.088 --> 13:28.705
We need to talk.

13:31.059 --> 13:33.677
Stefan told me
about the breakup.

13:36.814 --> 13:40.183
I'd say I'm sorry,
but I'm not.

13:42.887 --> 13:45.072
What did he say?

13:45.074 --> 13:47.157
Damon: Oh, you know.
Stuff.

13:47.159 --> 13:51.411
The guy just went on and on
about it. Wouldn't shut up.

13:51.413 --> 13:54.030
So he didn't
tell you why?

13:54.032 --> 13:56.700
Nope, but I'm sure
it has something to do

13:56.702 --> 14:00.087
with you acting weird,
so why don't you tell me?

14:05.075 --> 14:06.760
You.

14:17.555 --> 14:19.940
Damon Salvatore.

14:19.942 --> 14:23.477
Looks like we're traveling
the same circuit.

14:23.479 --> 14:25.862
Professor Shane.

14:25.864 --> 14:27.814
Just the guy
I wanted to see.

14:42.079 --> 14:44.548
Damon: So I'm in search
of another hunter.

14:44.550 --> 14:48.084
Shane: Hunter with
a capital "h"? Why?

14:48.086 --> 14:49.503
Same reason anyone
needs a hunter...

14:49.505 --> 14:52.506
loneliness, drinking buddy,
fourth for golf.

14:52.508 --> 14:54.424
I thought you said you
already had a potential.

14:54.426 --> 14:55.458
I did, but he
ended up being

14:55.460 --> 14:58.628
potentially
a problem, so...

14:58.630 --> 15:00.897
There's nothing
I can do to help you.

15:00.899 --> 15:03.433
Hmm. Well, why don't you
help me with this?

15:03.435 --> 15:04.985
Why are you here?

15:04.987 --> 15:08.805
What's in your little lesson
plan there, Professor?

15:08.807 --> 15:11.307
You think too highly
of me, Damon.

15:13.143 --> 15:14.778
I'm gonna go find
the other judges.

15:14.780 --> 15:16.863
Hey, no pity votes
for April young, ok?

15:16.865 --> 15:18.281
I mean, just because
her dad blew up a house

15:18.283 --> 15:19.499
with a dozen people
in it doesn't mean

15:19.501 --> 15:22.953
she should get
a tiara.

15:22.955 --> 15:25.255
But you knew him,
didn't you?

15:25.257 --> 15:26.339
Because I hear you
two racked up

15:26.341 --> 15:29.042
a pretty impressive
phone bill.

15:29.044 --> 15:31.995
If you want to know something
about me, Damon, just ask.

15:31.997 --> 15:34.130
Ok.

15:34.132 --> 15:38.685
How did you convince the pastor
to kill all those people?

15:38.687 --> 15:42.522
Did you just
accuse me of mass murder

15:42.524 --> 15:45.475
in the middle
of a High School pageant?

15:47.228 --> 15:48.528
Mrs. lockwood: Welcome
to this season's

15:48.530 --> 15:50.614
miss Mystic Falls.

15:50.616 --> 15:52.199

15:52.201 --> 15:53.900
We are so excited
to showcase

leaders in the making.

[Applause]

16:05.529 --> 16:08.415
Jeremy: What am I
doing here?

16:08.417 --> 16:10.984
Getting the chance to make
your sister human again.

16:10.986 --> 16:12.035
You interested?

16:12.037 --> 16:13.553
You have no idea.

16:13.555 --> 16:15.505
Actually, I do.

16:19.510 --> 16:21.061
Who is that?

16:21.063 --> 16:22.896
Stefan: Oh, it doesn't
really matter.

16:22.898 --> 16:25.932
All that matters is
that you're a vampire hunter

16:25.934 --> 16:28.051
and he's a vampire.

16:28.053 --> 16:30.553
Well, almost.

16:36.527 --> 16:38.278
Aah!

16:42.833 --> 16:44.400
Was this all so
I could stake him?

16:44.402 --> 16:46.402
Do you think I want to do this,
Jeremy? Look at me.

16:46.404 --> 16:48.872
I hate this. I don't want
to do this, but your sister

16:48.874 --> 16:50.290
isn't supposed to be
a vampire,

16:50.292 --> 16:51.675
and we need to help her.

16:51.677 --> 16:53.076
Stefan: He's a murderer,

16:53.078 --> 16:54.628
and he will gladly
kill again,

16:54.630 --> 16:55.912
so do it, Jeremy.

16:55.914 --> 16:57.797
Kill him.

16:58.766 --> 17:00.416
Jeremy: Stefan,
what are you doing?!

17:00.418 --> 17:02.251
What the hell
is wrong with you?

17:02.253 --> 17:06.473
Do it, Jeremy, or I will
rip the chains off for real.

17:06.474 --> 17:08.257
Do it!

17:08.259 --> 17:09.976
Aah!

17:15.983 --> 17:18.300
Aah! Aah!

17:18.303 --> 17:21.570
All right, enough.
He's dead.

[Classical music playing]

17:37.359 --> 17:39.493
Hey, why am I
bussing your tables?

17:39.495 --> 17:41.862
I said no empty
glasses.

17:44.866 --> 17:46.249
Will you guys
pick up the tempo?

17:46.251 --> 17:50.737
This is a pageant,
not a funeral.

17:50.739 --> 17:53.256
And how am I doing?

17:53.258 --> 17:54.624
You're...

17:55.626 --> 17:58.045
Perfect.

17:58.047 --> 17:59.463
Just so beyond
annoying,

17:59.465 --> 18:01.631
I can't even
look at you.

18:06.137 --> 18:08.722
They didn't waste
any time, did they?

18:19.484 --> 18:21.651
Let's just get today
over with.

18:23.771 --> 18:26.957
I can't believe
that I won.

18:26.959 --> 18:29.442
I just want to thank
the judges

18:29.444 --> 18:32.295
for seeing past the fact
that I'm a raging bitch.

18:32.297 --> 18:33.630
You don't want
to do that.

18:33.632 --> 18:35.499
Those girls
will cut you.

18:35.501 --> 18:37.117
They have nails.

18:37.119 --> 18:39.336
I have claws.

18:43.809 --> 18:46.459
As the reigning
miss Mystic Falls,

18:46.461 --> 18:47.761
it is my honor
to introduce

18:47.763 --> 18:50.514
this year's
miss mystic court!

Michelle Cunningham...

19:10.669 --> 19:12.869
Have you seen
Jeremy?

19:12.871 --> 19:15.872
He's probably
with the escorts.

19:15.874 --> 19:17.457
Caroline told me to
wrangle the escorts.

19:17.459 --> 19:19.126
He's not here.

19:19.128 --> 19:21.327
Caroline: Brianna Johnson,
accompanied by...

19:21.329 --> 19:23.130
Did he tell you
about his nightmares?

19:23.132 --> 19:24.464
What nightmares?

19:24.466 --> 19:26.833
The ones where
he kills you.

19:26.835 --> 19:31.021
Caroline: Katherine Wilson,
accompanied by Eric hanson.

19:31.023 --> 19:33.190
I'll find him, but...

19:38.179 --> 19:40.697
April's about to get
abandoned.

19:41.532 --> 19:43.533
I got this.

the last-minute escort change?

21:05.567 --> 21:06.983
Where is Jeremy?

21:06.985 --> 21:08.818
I'm calling him
right now.

21:08.820 --> 21:10.436
He's not
picking up.

21:10.438 --> 21:14.624
Do the math. Emo teen.
Open bar. It's fine.

21:14.626 --> 21:16.243
Matt said that Jeremy's
been having nightmares

21:16.245 --> 21:17.460
about killing
vampires

21:17.462 --> 21:19.779
and he's been
hiding it from me.

21:21.799 --> 21:23.133
Relax. I'm sure
he's fine.

21:23.135 --> 21:25.051
I don't know. I have a bad feeling.

21:25.053 --> 21:27.637
If I'm not worried,
you shouldn't be worried.

21:27.639 --> 21:29.723
Let it go.

21:29.725 --> 21:31.308
I'll go look for him.

21:32.626 --> 21:34.294
Ok.

21:36.130 --> 21:37.347
Ok. You go home.

21:37.349 --> 21:38.648
I'm gonna start
asking around here.

21:38.650 --> 21:39.899
Maybe Damon's right.

21:39.901 --> 21:41.935
Maybe he grabbed
a bottle from the bar

21:41.937 --> 21:43.320
and snuck off
to the woods.

21:43.322 --> 21:45.471
No. Damon's
never right.

21:45.473 --> 21:49.142
Damon is sneaky
and manipulative and rude,

21:49.144 --> 21:50.443
but he's never right.

21:50.445 --> 21:52.478
How can you not
see that?

21:52.480 --> 21:54.147
I don't know,
but why do I think

21:54.149 --> 21:57.167
that you won't
hesitate to tell me?

21:57.169 --> 21:58.868
Fine.
Friend-tervention.

21:58.870 --> 22:01.171
I think your so-called
feelings for Damon

22:01.173 --> 22:02.822
are really starting
to cloud your judgment,

22:02.824 --> 22:03.923
and I don't like it,

22:03.925 --> 22:05.008
and the thought
of you two together

22:05.010 --> 22:07.177
really makes me
want to barf.

22:07.179 --> 22:10.347
Easy, love.
You're making a scene.

22:10.349 --> 22:12.966

for making this
very difficult time so much easier.

the bad guy?

being the bad guy.

Please don't tell me

into a world of crazy.

turn her back into

in love with you.

want to believe it, Damon,

but she isn't
herself anymore.

22:39.694 --> 22:41.861

you would think that.

on this drawing.

or I will make you answer me.

anything.

look like?

compelled anymore.

as her best friend,

23:32.569 --> 23:33.952
it is my duty
to warn her

23:33.954 --> 23:35.620
when she's making
a giant mistake, right?

23:35.622 --> 23:37.873
And now she's taking
Damon's side on everything.

23:37.875 --> 23:41.276
So being a vampire
has changed her.

23:41.278 --> 23:44.779

amplifies who you already are.

It doesn't turn you into
a completely different person.

23:48.135 --> 23:51.670
Very peculiar.

23:51.672 --> 23:53.472
What's that look for?

23:53.474 --> 23:56.892
It'll all make sense
eventually.

23:56.894 --> 24:02.147
Whatever.
Just hurry up and find the cure.

24:02.149 --> 24:04.516
I'm working on it.

24:09.989 --> 24:12.441
Would you ever
take it?

24:12.443 --> 24:14.242
Now, why would I
want to cure myself

24:14.244 --> 24:16.194
of being the most
powerful creature

24:16.196 --> 24:18.997
on the planet, hmm?

24:18.999 --> 24:20.949
So there's not
one single moment

24:20.951 --> 24:23.535
in your whole life
that you wanted to be human.

24:24.653 --> 24:27.205
[Pop]

24:27.207 --> 24:29.624
How about you?

24:29.626 --> 24:31.126
Caroline: Ha ha ha!

24:31.128 --> 24:32.461
Ha!

24:32.463 --> 24:34.629
Life used to be
a lot easier.

24:34.631 --> 24:37.382
Don't you miss
the days of being...

24:39.101 --> 24:42.521
"Chair of the Mystic Falls
beautification committee"

24:42.523 --> 24:44.356
and the "director of the
policemen's yearly raffle"?

24:44.358 --> 24:45.640
Is that my
miss mystic application?

24:45.642 --> 24:46.892
Where did you
get that?

24:46.894 --> 24:48.527
"When I am chosen,

24:48.529 --> 24:50.729
I intend to redefine
excellence"...

24:50.731 --> 24:52.697
Now, I'm really enjoying
your use of "when" here.

24:52.699 --> 24:54.483
It's very confident.
Mm-hmm.

24:54.485 --> 24:56.535
"And above all,
I promise to aspire,

24:56.537 --> 24:58.236
inspire, and perspire."

24:58.238 --> 25:01.122
Obviously, we found a shortage
of words ending in "spire."

25:01.124 --> 25:04.709
Yeah. It's very funny.
It's hilarious. Just...

25:06.195 --> 25:09.297
ha ha ha!

25:09.299 --> 25:11.216
Klaus: Don't.

25:11.218 --> 25:13.701
Ha ha ha!

25:26.182 --> 25:28.233
Oh, hey.

25:30.719 --> 25:33.905
How do those two
know each other?

25:33.907 --> 25:35.073
They don't.

25:35.075 --> 25:36.241
Paranoid much?

25:36.243 --> 25:38.326
The council just got
burned to a crisp.

25:38.328 --> 25:39.911
Some mysterious hunters
just blew through town,

25:39.913 --> 25:41.246
and this guy
just happens to know

25:41.248 --> 25:43.565
everything
about everything.

25:43.567 --> 25:46.201
Yes, paranoid.

26:08.274 --> 26:10.592
April: Hey,
where have you been?

26:10.594 --> 26:14.362
Hey, sorry.
I got stuck at work.

26:14.364 --> 26:16.731
Jeremy, if you were too
chicken to do the dance thingy,

26:16.733 --> 26:18.199
then you should've
just told me.

26:18.201 --> 26:19.401
No, no.
I knew the dance.

26:19.403 --> 26:20.619
I watched
some lesson online,

26:20.621 --> 26:22.654
like, 100 times.

26:22.656 --> 26:25.490
You did?

26:26.626 --> 26:29.878
Hey, what's that
Shane guy doing here?

26:29.880 --> 26:31.446
He's a judge.

26:31.448 --> 26:33.248
I talked to him
about my dad.

26:33.250 --> 26:35.417
I mean, he said that
he never seemed depressed

26:35.419 --> 26:39.054
or suicidal
or anything, so...

26:39.056 --> 26:41.306
your dad?
Yeah.

26:41.308 --> 26:43.291
You know, I figured
I'd explore every possibility,

26:43.293 --> 26:45.427
even the bleak ones.

26:45.429 --> 26:47.012
What are you
looking at?

26:47.014 --> 26:49.731
Your dad was doing
the right thing for this town.

26:49.733 --> 26:53.818
The whole council was.
They died heroes.

26:58.608 --> 27:01.743
Oh, you again.
Ha ha!

27:01.745 --> 27:04.812
I must be the least
intimidating mass murderer ever.

27:04.814 --> 27:06.648
Well, you still
never gave me a name,

27:06.650 --> 27:08.166
and it's
kind of urgent.

27:08.168 --> 27:10.318
Listen. There is
no other name. Look.

27:10.320 --> 27:13.455
At any given moment, there are 5
hunters in existence, all right?

27:13.457 --> 27:15.156
Most of them have
no idea who they are

27:15.158 --> 27:17.292
or what
their purpose is.

27:17.294 --> 27:19.127
Means finding more
than one in a lifetime

27:19.129 --> 27:21.379
is next to impossible.

27:26.552 --> 27:29.354
Heh. Subtle.

27:29.356 --> 27:30.522
Like you didn't
already know.

27:30.524 --> 27:31.806
Oh...

27:31.808 --> 27:33.508
You have 5 seconds
to give me another name,

27:33.510 --> 27:34.842
or you die.

27:34.844 --> 27:36.027
You know, since it's
generally unwise

27:36.029 --> 27:37.512
for a vampire
to seek out a hunter,

27:37.514 --> 27:39.013
it means you're
interested in the Mark.

27:39.015 --> 27:40.949
That's probably because
of where it leads,

27:40.951 --> 27:41.983
but here's the thing.

27:41.985 --> 27:43.184
Even if you
complete the Mark

27:43.186 --> 27:44.369
and you get the map,

27:44.371 --> 27:46.154
the thing that
you're looking for

27:46.156 --> 27:47.872
is sealed with a spell
only a certain kind

27:47.874 --> 27:49.090
of witch can perform.

27:49.092 --> 27:50.592
What kind of witch?

27:50.594 --> 27:53.878
Come on, Damon. Uh!

27:53.880 --> 27:58.866
I love pressure points.
What kind of witch?

27:58.868 --> 28:00.034
Come on.
You're a big boy.

28:00.036 --> 28:02.587
You can figure
this one out.

28:02.589 --> 28:04.222
A Bennett witch.

28:04.224 --> 28:05.540
Aren't too many of
those lying around,

28:05.542 --> 28:07.142
as I'm sure you know.

28:07.144 --> 28:08.810
So none of this matters
until Bonnie

28:08.812 --> 28:10.178
is back in touch
with her magic.

28:10.180 --> 28:12.564
Between the two of us,
who do you think

28:12.566 --> 28:15.717
she trusts to help
her get there?

28:18.854 --> 28:21.723
5 seconds are up

28:21.725 --> 28:25.059
unless you just realized
you need me alive.

28:25.061 --> 28:26.227
Now, if you'll
excuse me,

28:26.229 --> 28:28.563
I have a scholarship
to award.

28:30.416 --> 28:33.702
Mrs. lockwood: And now the
moment you've been waiting for.

28:33.704 --> 28:36.755
Caroline, would you
do the honors?

28:36.757 --> 28:41.626
This year's
miss Mystic Falls is...

28:43.713 --> 28:45.380
April young.

28:45.382 --> 28:48.433
[Cheering and applause]

28:56.392 --> 28:57.976
Jeremy.

29:15.578 --> 29:18.613
Hey, where
have you been?

29:19.415 --> 29:21.949
What are you doing
with that?

29:25.421 --> 29:27.121
Put it down.

29:27.123 --> 29:29.591
Connor was right.

29:29.593 --> 29:33.428
All I can think about
is killing vampires.

29:34.480 --> 29:36.815
You're nothing
like Connor.

29:36.817 --> 29:39.651
I want
to believe that,

29:39.653 --> 29:41.486
and I know I don't
want to hurt you,

29:41.488 --> 29:43.905
but everything
inside of me is telling me

29:43.907 --> 29:46.491
to drive this stake
through your heart.

29:46.493 --> 29:49.027
Why would you
say that?

29:50.362 --> 29:53.248
It's me, Jeremy.

29:53.250 --> 29:55.650
And you're a vampire.

29:55.652 --> 29:58.319
Yeah, but I'm also
your sister.

29:58.321 --> 29:59.838
Jer...

30:02.591 --> 30:05.176
I would never do
anything to hurt you.

30:14.837 --> 30:17.672
No.

30:19.308 --> 30:21.810
Get it away from me.

30:24.814 --> 30:27.615
Jere...
Jeremy.

30:27.617 --> 30:30.368
Jer, wake up.
Please wake up.

30:32.187 --> 30:33.571
Nngh...

30:40.529 --> 30:42.196
Jeremy! Get out of here, Matt.

30:42.198 --> 30:44.031
Jeremy, you don't
want to do this, ok?

30:44.033 --> 30:45.216
That's your sister.

30:45.218 --> 30:46.551
It's that stupid Mark
on your arm.

30:46.553 --> 30:48.536
Shut up, Matt!
Jeremy, look at me.

30:48.538 --> 30:50.088
I'm human,
and I'm telling you

30:50.090 --> 30:52.707
not to hurt her.

30:54.894 --> 30:57.061
Stefan:
Get out of here, Matt!

30:58.731 --> 31:00.315
[Panting]

31:00.317 --> 31:02.100
Let me do it.
Let me do it. Let me do it.

31:02.102 --> 31:05.103
[Gasps]

31:05.105 --> 31:06.721
Oh!

31:06.723 --> 31:08.022
[Exhales]

31:08.024 --> 31:09.407
Oh...

31:26.901 --> 31:28.735
Your mom parties harder
than you do.

31:28.737 --> 31:30.404
Does she have the gene?

31:30.406 --> 31:33.040
Dad.
Ah.

31:33.042 --> 31:34.792
What about
your parents?

31:34.794 --> 31:36.794
Never met them.

31:36.796 --> 31:38.111
My adoptive parents
found out

31:38.113 --> 31:40.080
about my wolf gene
when I did,

31:40.082 --> 31:42.382
the night that I turned

31:42.384 --> 31:45.118
and tore apart
their living room.

31:45.120 --> 31:47.120
Promptly
kicked me out.

31:47.122 --> 31:50.474
You never told me
how it triggered.

31:50.476 --> 31:54.261
You mean,
who I killed?

31:54.263 --> 31:56.814
Boating accident.

31:56.816 --> 31:59.483
We were drunk.
I thought I wasn't.

32:02.687 --> 32:04.938
So what's with you

32:04.940 --> 32:07.107
chatting up all these
old-timers, huh...

32:07.109 --> 32:09.660
my mom,
that Professor guy.

32:09.662 --> 32:12.646
That Professor guy
is, like, 30,

32:12.648 --> 32:16.283
and he's hot
and smart.

32:16.285 --> 32:18.168
You know him
or something?

32:18.170 --> 32:20.988
No. I just met him.
Why?

32:20.990 --> 32:23.474
No reason.

32:26.427 --> 32:29.296
Klaus: I never
answered your question,

32:29.298 --> 32:32.332
if I'd ever thought
about being human.

32:32.334 --> 32:33.800
Once.

32:33.802 --> 32:36.970
I was on a trek
in the andes,

32:36.972 --> 32:41.358
and a hummingbird
flew up to me

32:41.360 --> 32:43.443
and just hovered there
staring at me.

32:43.445 --> 32:46.530
Its tiny heart was pattering
like a machine gun...

32:48.483 --> 32:53.036
And I thought,
"what a thing, you know,

32:53.038 --> 32:55.739
"to have to work
that hard every day

32:55.741 --> 32:57.624
"just to stay alive,

32:57.626 --> 33:01.795
to be constantly
on the verge of death,"

33:01.797 --> 33:03.747
and how satisfying
every day must be

33:03.749 --> 33:06.049
that it survived...

33:07.569 --> 33:09.136
And that
was the only time

33:09.138 --> 33:11.822
I thought
about being human.

33:17.312 --> 33:19.879
What's he saying?

33:19.881 --> 33:23.233
A bunch of bs
about being human.

33:23.235 --> 33:26.270
The sooner we get rid
of this guy, the better.

33:27.105 --> 33:28.605
Elena, wait.

33:28.607 --> 33:29.940
I have to find Jeremy.

33:29.942 --> 33:31.241
This shouldn't be
happening to him.

33:31.243 --> 33:32.892
Elena, wait.
It's my fault.

33:32.894 --> 33:34.528
What are you
talking about?

33:34.530 --> 33:35.913
I'm starting to think
that when a hunter

33:35.915 --> 33:37.230
kills a vampire,
their urge

33:37.232 --> 33:39.449
to keep killing
grows stronger.

33:40.752 --> 33:42.286
Tell me that Jeremy
hasn't been with you

33:42.288 --> 33:44.888
this entire time.

33:44.890 --> 33:47.374
Tell me that you haven't
been making him

33:47.376 --> 33:48.709
kill vampires, Stefan.

33:48.711 --> 33:50.510
We need the map
to get the cure.

33:50.512 --> 33:53.079
If getting my humanity back
means stripping Jeremy of his,

33:53.081 --> 33:54.464
then I don't
want the cure.

33:54.466 --> 33:57.884
He's the only way
to fix all of this.

33:57.886 --> 34:00.771
You mean me,

34:00.773 --> 34:04.257
the only way
to fix me.

34:04.259 --> 34:05.592
[Sighs]

34:05.594 --> 34:08.110
You don't have
to love me like this.

34:11.931 --> 34:14.934
This is who I am now.

34:14.936 --> 34:18.655
The old Elena died when
she went off that bridge.

34:18.657 --> 34:21.408
Let her go.

34:57.027 --> 34:59.712
Matt:
What are you doing?

34:59.714 --> 35:01.214
I can't keep
living here

35:01.216 --> 35:04.083
if I want
to kill my sister.

35:04.085 --> 35:07.036
Elena knows that.

35:07.038 --> 35:09.889
That's why she moved out
and asked me to move in.

35:09.891 --> 35:11.707
What?
Look.

35:11.709 --> 35:13.476
I'm not one
of them, jer.

35:13.478 --> 35:15.478
I'll keep an eye on you,

35:15.480 --> 35:17.930
and we can keep this
hunter business in check.

35:17.932 --> 35:20.883
Where's Elena
gonna go?

35:36.366 --> 35:40.286
I can't stay at home
anymore.

35:44.391 --> 35:46.759
Pick a room.

35:48.595 --> 35:50.880
I'll crash
somewhere else.

35:59.806 --> 36:02.642
Tell me it's over, Ty.

36:02.644 --> 36:06.145
I really don't think
I can do this anymore.

36:09.650 --> 36:13.736
It's over.
Nice work.

36:13.738 --> 36:16.989
We are one step closer
to ending this.

36:24.131 --> 36:26.749
[Exhales]

36:33.623 --> 36:36.425
We got another one.

36:36.427 --> 36:39.128
Good.

36:39.130 --> 36:41.964
We're almost ready.

36:41.966 --> 36:44.900
I want to leave Tyler out of
this when it all goes down.

36:44.902 --> 36:48.821
We'll talk when you've
broken theast le.

36:54.995 --> 36:57.363
Ah, thanks.

37:00.167 --> 37:01.817
Just being polite.

37:01.819 --> 37:03.336
Thought you
hated whiskey.

37:03.338 --> 37:05.371
My brother
wants to kill me.

37:05.373 --> 37:07.673
Welcome to the club.

37:12.879 --> 37:15.464
Jeremy can't
live with me,

37:15.466 --> 37:17.183
Stefan wants
to fix me,

37:17.185 --> 37:18.884
and Caroline
flat out admitted

37:18.886 --> 37:21.437
that she doesn't
like me this way.

37:21.439 --> 37:24.840
Think it's safe to say that I'm not
so great at this vampire thing.

37:24.842 --> 37:27.526
You want to know
what I think?

37:30.113 --> 37:33.699
I don't think I've ever
seen you more alive.

37:41.541 --> 37:45.161
That dance that
they did today

37:45.163 --> 37:46.879
kind of reminded me
of when...

37:46.881 --> 37:48.914
when we
danced together?

37:54.554 --> 37:59.392
I wanted to dance
with you today.

37:59.394 --> 38:01.677
[Music playing]

38:49.592 --> 38:51.110
[Clears throat]

38:51.112 --> 38:54.763
Elena is right.
I just need to let go.

38:54.765 --> 38:56.398
No. You're right,
Stefan.

38:56.400 --> 38:58.234
It's not pretty,
and it's not easy,

38:58.236 --> 39:00.953
but you can't
give up on her.

39:00.955 --> 39:03.239
Caroline, she looked
me in the eye,

39:03.241 --> 39:05.541
and she told me
to move on.

39:05.543 --> 39:07.442
She's lost, ok?

39:07.444 --> 39:10.079
You and her... epic.

39:10.081 --> 39:14.750
Her and Damon...
ugh, God.

39:14.752 --> 39:18.620
There's something
wrong with her.

39:21.141 --> 39:23.509
Just promise me you won't
stop looking for the cure.

39:23.511 --> 39:25.845
Klaus won't let me,
even if I wanted to.

39:25.847 --> 39:27.730
What does he care?
He doesn't even want it.

39:27.732 --> 39:29.464
He wants to keep
Elena human

39:29.466 --> 39:31.734
so that he can make
more hybrids.

39:31.736 --> 39:33.402
He's gonna need them.

39:33.404 --> 39:36.105
Tyler has almost got
all of them unsired.

39:39.709 --> 39:41.660
Oh, my God.

39:46.616 --> 39:48.000
Oh...

39:48.002 --> 39:49.285
My...

39:49.287 --> 39:50.669
God.

40:00.013 --> 40:01.964
Uh...

40:01.966 --> 40:04.517
I was trying to understand
why Klaus was so intrigued

40:04.519 --> 40:06.335
by Damon and Elena.

40:06.337 --> 40:07.636
He said I would
figure it out.

40:07.638 --> 40:09.355
This is what he
was talking about.

40:09.357 --> 40:10.839
What are you
talking about?

40:10.841 --> 40:11.941
Think about it.

40:11.943 --> 40:13.359
Every time Elena
has had a problem,

40:13.361 --> 40:16.195
Damon has been
the magic solution.

40:22.869 --> 40:26.322
Caroline: Today Elena
was worried about Jeremy.

40:26.324 --> 40:28.190
Who swoops in
and tells her to relax?

40:28.192 --> 40:30.276
Damon, and she listens.

40:30.278 --> 40:32.711
When Elena started feeding,
who said that she could only

40:32.713 --> 40:35.214
drink blood
straight from the vein?

40:35.216 --> 40:37.082
Damon.

40:37.084 --> 40:39.668
[Music playing]

40:39.670 --> 40:41.186
And when she tried
to drink from animals?

40:41.188 --> 40:42.204
Couldn't
keep it down.

40:42.206 --> 40:44.039
And blood bags?
Same thing.

40:44.041 --> 40:45.841
[Music playing]

40:48.645 --> 40:51.146
Name one vampire
in the history of vampires

40:51.148 --> 40:53.649
who couldn't drink
blood from a blood bag.

40:53.651 --> 40:56.518
Damon said she couldn't,
so she couldn't.

40:56.520 --> 40:58.604
[Music playing]

41:03.059 --> 41:05.661
Damon likes the red dress,
Elena likes the red dress.

41:05.663 --> 41:08.113
Damon says kill Connor,
she kills Connor.
elle tue Connor.</font></font>

41:08.115 --> 41:10.399
What if
it's possible?

41:10.401 --> 41:14.236
Damon's blood made her
a vampire, right?

41:14.238 --> 41:16.422
It's rare,
but it happens

41:16.424 --> 41:18.907
What if this
is one of those times?

41:18.909 --> 41:22.294
What if this
is really happening?

41:22.296 --> 41:24.763
[Music playing]

41:33.607 --> 41:36.692
Elena is sired
to Damon.
