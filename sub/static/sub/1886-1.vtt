01:22.573 --> 01:25.992
...was so ably pointed out
by the Secretary-General

01:26.076 --> 01:27.869
in his opening remarks.

01:28.829 --> 01:31.539
But, and I must emphasize this point,

01:31.832 --> 01:37.128
no formula can or will
ever cover each case.

01:38.464 --> 01:40.381
For instance...

01:45.137 --> 01:48.556
...when three or more applicants
have been recognized,

01:48.849 --> 01:52.185
which is in direct contradiction to...

03:02.130 --> 03:03.756
Whose funeral is it?

03:05.300 --> 03:06.342
Yours.

04:57.162 --> 04:58.245
When you were young

04:58.330 --> 05:02.375
And your heart was an open book

05:04.795 --> 05:08.673
You used to say live and let live

05:09.174 --> 05:12.885
You know you did, you know you did
You know you did

05:13.053 --> 05:18.391
But if this ever-changing world
in which we live in

05:18.976 --> 05:23.062
Makes you give in and cry

05:26.066 --> 05:28.150
Say live and let die

05:31.196 --> 05:41.372
Live and let die

06:10.152 --> 06:12.361
What does it matter to ya?

06:13.280 --> 06:16.782
When you got a job to do,
you got to do it well

06:18.118 --> 06:21.537
You got to give
the other fellow hell

06:46.563 --> 06:49.940
You used to say live and let live

06:50.525 --> 06:54.070
You know you did, you know you did
You know you did

06:54.821 --> 06:59.825
But if this ever-changing world
in which we live in

07:00.410 --> 07:04.121
Makes you give in and cry

07:07.250 --> 07:09.376
Say live and let die

07:12.339 --> 07:22.264
Live and let die

07:56.091 --> 07:58.259
One more time again?

08:12.399 --> 08:14.400
Not married by any chance, are you?

08:28.081 --> 08:29.874
Good morning, 007.

08:31.001 --> 08:32.501
Good morning.

08:35.130 --> 08:38.506
- Insomnia, sir?
- Instructions.

08:40.010 --> 08:43.261
You haven't much time.
I'll explain as you pack.

08:45.056 --> 08:46.098
Pack, sir?

08:46.183 --> 08:48.934
Three of our agents have been killed
during the last 24 hours.

08:49.019 --> 08:51.604
Dawes in New York.
Hamilton in New Orleans.

08:51.855 --> 08:55.691
- And Baines in the Caribbean.
- Baines, I rather liked Baines.

08:55.942 --> 08:57.860
We shared the same bootmaker.

08:58.486 --> 09:01.197
Coffee, sir?

09:12.250 --> 09:14.585
I take it these killings are connected.

09:15.629 --> 09:18.047
That's precisely
what you're going to find out.

09:26.806 --> 09:30.184
Baines was working on a small island
in the Caribbean called San Monique.

09:31.603 --> 09:33.229
Dawes was in New York

09:33.313 --> 09:36.649
keeping an eye on its prime minister,
one Dr. Kananga.

09:36.733 --> 09:39.318
Hamilton was on loan to the Americans
in New Orleans.

09:45.200 --> 09:46.492
Is that all it does?

09:48.328 --> 09:50.704
By the way,
congratulations seem to be in order.

09:51.081 --> 09:54.667
The Italians were most impressed
by the way you handled the Rome affair.

09:54.751 --> 09:56.835
Thank you, sir. Sugar?

09:58.755 --> 09:59.838
Thanks.

10:00.507 --> 10:02.675
Well, the authorities
were more than helpful.

10:04.135 --> 10:05.928
There's one small complaint.

10:07.180 --> 10:09.807
They seem to be missing
one of their agents,

10:10.100 --> 10:12.768
a Miss Caruso.

10:15.605 --> 10:17.982
You wouldn't happen
to know where she is?

10:19.985 --> 10:21.235
Miss Moneypenny.

10:21.945 --> 10:23.153
Morning, Moneypenny.

10:23.780 --> 10:26.699
- Good morning, sir.
- Certainly the hour that's indecent.

10:26.992 --> 10:30.202
Really? I've got your ticket to New York.

10:30.287 --> 10:32.454
Q has repaired your wristwatch.

10:32.789 --> 10:35.541
And some background material
on San Monique.

10:35.625 --> 10:36.875
Thank you, Moneypenny.

10:37.002 --> 10:40.629
I'm sure the overburdened British
taxpayer will be fascinated to know

10:40.714 --> 10:43.674
how the Special Ordnance Section
disburses its funds.

10:44.467 --> 10:46.427
In future, Commander,
allow me to suggest

10:46.511 --> 10:49.972
a perfectly adequate watchmaker,
just down the street.

10:52.892 --> 10:53.934
Good God.

10:54.352 --> 10:56.395
You see, by pulling out this button, sir,

10:56.646 --> 10:59.732
it turns the watch into
a hyper-intensified magnetic field.

11:00.650 --> 11:03.235
Powerful enough to even deflect
the path of a bullet

11:03.320 --> 11:05.612
at long range, or so Q claims.

11:05.822 --> 11:08.490
I feel very tempted
to test that theory right now.

11:10.285 --> 11:12.202
If you don't mind, Commander, my spoon.

11:12.579 --> 11:14.538
Oh, sorry, sir.

11:14.956 --> 11:16.081
Thank you.

11:16.166 --> 11:18.167
Dr. Kananga is, at present, in New York.

11:19.336 --> 11:22.504
The CIA have been informed, and
they're helping out with the surveillance.

11:22.589 --> 11:24.506
Your flight arrives at 11:30 a. m.

11:24.591 --> 11:26.592
Now, where did I leave my coat?

11:27.427 --> 11:28.886
Oh, allow me.

11:37.270 --> 11:39.104
Thank you.
Come along, Miss Moneypenny.

11:39.189 --> 11:41.607
- Morning, Bond.
- Sir. Miss Moneypenny,

11:44.194 --> 11:45.361
thank you.

11:45.904 --> 11:46.987
Goodbye, James.

11:49.699 --> 11:52.576
Or should I say ciao, bello.

12:25.860 --> 12:27.736
Such a delicate touch.

12:28.905 --> 12:30.572
Sheer magnetism, darling.

12:38.832 --> 12:40.457
A man comes.

12:43.628 --> 12:46.088
He travels quickly.

12:49.676 --> 12:51.009
He has purpose.

12:52.679 --> 12:54.179
He comes over water.

12:55.098 --> 12:56.640
He travels with others.

12:58.309 --> 12:59.518
He will oppose.

13:00.437 --> 13:02.521
He brings violence and destruction.

13:44.898 --> 13:47.983
Hello. Mr. Leiter for you, sir.

13:48.193 --> 13:51.987
Thank you. Hello, Felix. How are you?

13:52.530 --> 13:55.616
Traffic permitting, I should be with you
in about half an hour.

13:55.700 --> 13:57.910
Then you can buy me
the best lunch in New York.

13:58.828 --> 14:02.539
Fine, James.
Your friend Kananga has just left the UN.

14:02.749 --> 14:04.625
He's probably headed back to his embassy.

14:05.126 --> 14:08.837
No, no, don't worry. I've got the place
eyeballed, wired for sound, the works.

14:09.547 --> 14:11.757
Right. I'll see you in about a half hour.

15:06.521 --> 15:08.647
Easy, Charlie. Let's get there in one piece.

15:11.109 --> 15:12.150
Charlie?

15:55.987 --> 15:57.362
Right. Stand by.

15:58.197 --> 16:00.365
Here comes Kananga's limousine.

16:05.872 --> 16:06.872
Out he gets

16:08.124 --> 16:09.750
with the usual goon squad

16:10.251 --> 16:11.543
and the girl.

16:12.045 --> 16:13.211
Time, 11:46.

16:15.757 --> 16:17.007
What is that?

16:21.763 --> 16:24.473
Hello, Felix?
You know how I hate to trouble you,

16:24.557 --> 16:26.391
but I've run into a little bother.

16:30.188 --> 16:31.313
You what?

16:34.734 --> 16:37.069
Get me a make on a white pimpmobile.

16:39.364 --> 16:41.823
347 Nelson-David-George.

16:42.367 --> 16:45.494
It would seem, Dr. Kananga,
that the conference has not lived up

16:45.578 --> 16:46.745
to your prior expectations.

16:46.829 --> 16:49.706
Well, we can only hope
that this is a temporary setback.

16:49.874 --> 16:52.584
However, I do have some observations
to make.

16:54.629 --> 16:55.754
Take a letter, please.

16:57.423 --> 17:00.425
To Secretary-General,
Pan Island Unity Conference.

17:01.511 --> 17:02.552
Sir.

17:05.890 --> 17:10.143
I wish to point out that...

17:10.686 --> 17:12.604
...too many of our island neighbors

17:13.106 --> 17:15.232
have once again let themselves be

17:15.942 --> 17:17.943
bullied by United States industry.

17:18.944 --> 17:20.444
The story is an old one,

17:21.071 --> 17:22.406
the record a clear one.

17:23.156 --> 17:26.326
Since my historic statement of principles

17:26.953 --> 17:29.830
was delivered and acted upon
some six months ago,

17:30.540 --> 17:33.542
our economic outlook
has improved dramatically.

17:34.419 --> 17:38.422
By exercising our policy of friendship
to all with favoritism towards none,

17:38.881 --> 17:42.175
new respect for the entire area
has been engendered.

17:43.094 --> 17:44.803
And even though
some of my most important...

17:44.887 --> 17:48.890
James, that car is registered
to a shop at 33, East 65th Street.

17:49.100 --> 17:51.476
That's only a block away from here. Right.

17:52.145 --> 17:55.480
Take your time, buddy.
Kananga's knitting a flag in there.

17:55.565 --> 17:57.149
It might be the easiest thing to do.

18:22.508 --> 18:24.301
Something in heads?

18:25.887 --> 18:27.846
Just browsing. Thank you.

18:52.872 --> 18:53.872
$5.

18:54.415 --> 18:56.792
Do you think you could gift-wrap it
for me, please?

18:57.668 --> 18:59.336
Lengthwise, if you don't mind.

19:00.213 --> 19:01.338
Thank you.

19:24.153 --> 19:26.029
...remains my first concern.

19:26.864 --> 19:29.699
Thus, San Monique's future obligations
vis-Ã -vis her island neighbors

19:29.784 --> 19:30.867
would seem clear.

19:31.619 --> 19:34.746
Those who fawn and crawl
in the face of intimidation

19:34.914 --> 19:38.208
must perforce to look up
to those who stand proudly

19:38.292 --> 19:40.627
wrapped in a justifiable self-confidence.

19:41.504 --> 19:43.088
The time has come,

19:43.756 --> 19:45.173
painful as it may be,

19:45.800 --> 19:48.426
to gaze out among our sister nations
in the area

19:48.594 --> 19:50.220
and see if any stands tall...

20:44.317 --> 20:45.442
He's tailing.

20:49.989 --> 20:52.157
I got him in my sights.

21:06.005 --> 21:09.507
- Hey, you know where you going, man?
- Uptown, I believe.

21:09.592 --> 21:13.011
Uptown? You headed into Harlem, man.

21:13.095 --> 21:14.930
Well, you just keep on the tail
of that jukebox

21:15.014 --> 21:16.806
and there's an extra 20 in it for you.

21:16.891 --> 21:19.059
Hey, man, for 20 bucks

21:19.143 --> 21:21.937
I'll take you to a Ku Klux Klan cookout.

21:39.246 --> 21:42.082
125th, you got a honky on your tail.

21:56.847 --> 21:58.181
He's heading east.

21:58.516 --> 22:00.892
Can't miss him.
It's like following a cue ball.

22:06.190 --> 22:08.900
That's the car.
They must have gone inside.

22:09.360 --> 22:10.986
Pull up where you can.

22:18.077 --> 22:19.995
Sure hope you make friends easy.

22:20.538 --> 22:21.788
Right on, brother.

22:26.377 --> 22:27.752
He's heading on in.

22:52.903 --> 22:56.072
Good afternoon.
Bourbon and water, please.

22:56.282 --> 22:57.532
First booth will do.

22:59.535 --> 23:01.536
- Tell him neat, would you?
- Huh?

23:01.620 --> 23:03.788
- No ice.
- That's extra, man.

23:20.639 --> 23:24.350
I'd like something on the side
as well, information.

23:25.186 --> 23:26.895
Three men and a girl came in.

23:32.943 --> 23:34.486
Relax, baby.

23:35.237 --> 23:38.114
Mr. Big's gonna take care of you
in a minute.

23:59.929 --> 24:02.889
Black queen on the red king, Miss...

24:04.475 --> 24:06.976
- Solitaire.
- My name's Bond.

24:09.146 --> 24:10.313
James Bond.

24:10.898 --> 24:14.776
I know who you are, what you are
and why you've come.

24:15.778 --> 24:19.155
You have made a mistake.
You will not succeed.

24:20.574 --> 24:23.201
Rather a sweeping statement,
considering we've never met.

24:24.453 --> 24:26.079
The cards have followed you for me.

24:26.330 --> 24:30.458
Now, you get ripped off in Detroit,
baby, you yell out to me, you hear?

24:36.048 --> 24:37.549
Is he armed?

24:39.718 --> 24:43.138
You can't be too careful
in New York City these days.

25:05.911 --> 25:08.830
Funny how the least little thing
amuses him.

25:15.921 --> 25:17.005
Oh, fascinating.

25:17.756 --> 25:19.299
Well, that's you, quite obviously.

25:19.592 --> 25:21.634
An amazing resemblance.

25:21.719 --> 25:23.386
Tell me, am I in there as well?

25:25.097 --> 25:26.222
Pick a card.

25:30.394 --> 25:31.477
Turn it over.

25:35.232 --> 25:36.774
You have found yourself.

25:38.068 --> 25:41.487
I'm telling you,
you all go out there to LA and clean it up,

25:41.614 --> 25:44.407
or I'm coming out there and clean you up,
and I mean that!

25:45.868 --> 25:48.119
Is this the stupid mother
that tailed you uptown?

25:48.204 --> 25:51.539
There seems to be some mistake.
My name is...

25:51.624 --> 25:53.291
Names is for tombstones, baby.

25:53.500 --> 25:55.627
You all take this honky out
and waste him, now.

26:01.258 --> 26:04.344
- "Waste him"? Is that a good thing?
- The reading is over.

26:04.803 --> 26:06.262
Nothing about my future?

26:15.731 --> 26:16.731
Us?

26:21.028 --> 26:24.155
Now, promise you'll stay right there.
I shan't be long.

26:34.291 --> 26:35.416
Thank you.

26:53.727 --> 26:55.353
Keep your hands up, honky.

26:55.938 --> 26:58.898
What does he think this is?
I'll blow his frigging head off, man.

27:11.078 --> 27:12.328
Drop it!

27:17.376 --> 27:18.418
Now.

27:27.177 --> 27:30.221
"Harold Strutter, CIA."
Where were you when I didn't need you?

27:30.889 --> 27:32.724
Kind of obvious
you weren't coming out front,

27:33.058 --> 27:35.435
not even with that clever disguise
you're wearing.

27:36.145 --> 27:37.645
Whiteface in Harlem.

27:38.272 --> 27:41.024
Good thinking, Bond. Let's get out of here.

27:45.487 --> 27:47.322
I'm surprised they didn't spot you, too.

27:47.406 --> 27:50.408
There's a most remarkable girl
back there with a deck of cards.

27:50.951 --> 27:54.787
I saw those cards on the way up.
Spades, James, every one.

27:55.247 --> 27:57.582
You were nailed the minute you left 74th.

27:57.875 --> 27:59.584
There's only supposed to be one man
who can pull together

27:59.668 --> 28:01.377
that much black muscle in this town.

28:01.462 --> 28:02.920
Calls himself Mr. Big.

28:03.422 --> 28:06.299
You name the business,
they say he has a black concession.

28:13.599 --> 28:16.100
What would a foreign prime minister
like Kananga

28:16.185 --> 28:18.144
want with an American gangster?

28:18.354 --> 28:21.856
The question is, what would Mr. Big
want with a two-bit island diplomat?

28:22.107 --> 28:26.152
Mr. Big?
Where the hell does he fit into this mess?

28:30.657 --> 28:33.701
A genuine Felix lighter. Illuminating.

28:34.453 --> 28:35.453
Now, listen, James,

28:35.537 --> 28:38.081
we just found out
that Kananga's got a private plane

28:38.165 --> 28:40.708
and he's leaving for San Monique
within the hour.

28:40.793 --> 28:43.086
Then get me on the next available flight,
will you, Felix?

28:43.170 --> 28:44.295
I already did.

28:44.505 --> 28:48.383
I just knew you wouldn't pass up a chance
to get away from where the real action is.

28:59.770 --> 29:02.146
The legendary Baron Samedi, folks.

29:02.231 --> 29:04.524
That's Saturday,
for those of you who speak French.

29:04.942 --> 29:08.611
Voodoo god of cemeteries
and chief of the legion of the dead.

29:08.695 --> 29:10.905
The man who cannot die.

29:10.989 --> 29:15.034
But for our purposes, just a performer
in a little musical extravaganza

29:15.119 --> 29:17.954
we've cooked up for you wonderful people.

29:31.802 --> 29:34.595
Good evening. The name is Bond.
You have a reservation for me.

29:34.680 --> 29:37.932
Yes, Mr. Bond, of course.
Mrs. Bond has been expecting you.

29:40.185 --> 29:43.354
- Mrs. Bond?
- She arrived earlier this afternoon, sir.

29:43.772 --> 29:46.858
Said she preferred
something a little more private.

29:47.526 --> 29:48.985
Bungalow 12.

29:49.361 --> 29:51.529
An incurable romantic, Mrs. Bond.

31:45.644 --> 31:46.978
Room service, please.

31:51.483 --> 31:54.402
Room service?
This is Mr. Bond, bungalow 12.

31:54.486 --> 31:58.656
I'd like a bottle of Bollinger, please.
Slightly chilled.

32:01.326 --> 32:03.578
Two glasses. Thank you.

33:14.566 --> 33:16.025
Anybody home?

33:23.867 --> 33:25.409
Your champagne, sir.

33:26.036 --> 33:28.371
- What was that?
- Your champagne.

33:28.664 --> 33:30.206
Put it on the table. Thanks.

33:35.712 --> 33:37.713
- Shall I open it?
- What?

33:38.590 --> 33:39.757
Shall I open it?

33:41.343 --> 33:43.427
No. I can manage. Thank you.

33:46.390 --> 33:47.932
- There you are.
- Thank you.

35:15.896 --> 35:17.897
Mrs. Bond, I presume?

35:19.608 --> 35:20.858
I'm Rosie Carver.

35:24.988 --> 35:27.156
I guess I have a little explaining to do.

35:33.288 --> 35:35.581
Yes. Either you

35:36.541 --> 35:38.375
or dear Uncle Felix.

35:40.545 --> 35:42.505
Custom. 38 Smith & Wesson.

35:43.173 --> 35:45.299
Corrugated 3-inch stock. No serial number.

35:45.383 --> 35:46.717
Standard CIA issue.

35:47.886 --> 35:50.888
Question is, why point it at me?

35:51.640 --> 35:54.767
The man who delivered your champagne
is not a hotel waiter.

35:55.727 --> 35:57.394
I was just trying to be careful.

35:58.146 --> 36:00.231
As for Felix Leiter, you're right.

36:00.816 --> 36:03.734
I've worked for CIA down here
for some time now,

36:03.819 --> 36:07.571
and he cabled me you were coming
and asked if I wouldn't help out, if I could.

36:07.948 --> 36:11.033
Perhaps you'd better start
by getting your head together.

36:13.411 --> 36:15.913
- There's a mirror in the bathroom.
- Yes.

36:17.749 --> 36:19.917
You're only my second mission, you know.

36:20.418 --> 36:23.254
My first was Baines,
the agent who was killed.

36:24.965 --> 36:28.259
It's a relief to know I'm next in line
for the same kind of aid.

36:35.851 --> 36:37.059
There's a...

36:37.143 --> 36:39.562
- There's a...
- A snake. I forgot. I should've told you.

36:39.646 --> 36:41.981
You should never go in there
without a mongoose.

36:42.065 --> 36:44.692
I should have never gotten into any of this.

36:45.360 --> 36:47.736
I'm going to be completely useless to you.

36:49.447 --> 36:51.156
I'm sure we'll be able
to lick you into shape.

36:52.450 --> 36:55.619
It's getting late, Mrs. Bond.

36:56.246 --> 36:58.122
Tomorrow is going to be
a very busy day for us.

36:58.206 --> 37:00.583
You see, Kananga is protecting something
down here,

37:00.667 --> 37:01.750
something which

37:02.335 --> 37:03.961
Baines obviously discovered.

37:05.130 --> 37:08.090
You're going to show me the spot
where Baines' body was found.

37:09.301 --> 37:13.137
That, I'm afraid,
only leaves us tonight to, well,

37:13.638 --> 37:15.264
catch up on old times.

37:16.641 --> 37:18.976
Felix told me there'd be moments like this.

37:20.562 --> 37:23.147
What did good old Felix suggest?

37:24.482 --> 37:27.526
If all else failed, cyanide pills.

37:30.447 --> 37:32.323
I settled for two bedrooms.

37:35.577 --> 37:36.911
Good night, Mr. Bond.

37:37.996 --> 37:38.996
Mrs. Bond.

37:54.095 --> 37:57.181
Why, it's just a hat, darling,
belonging to a small-headed man

37:57.265 --> 37:59.308
of limited means
who lost a fight with a chicken.

37:59.809 --> 38:02.061
It's a warning. Get it out of here!

38:04.481 --> 38:05.689
Please.

38:06.566 --> 38:08.943
Please don't leave me alone tonight.

38:09.027 --> 38:12.112
James, please promise me.

38:14.824 --> 38:16.659
All right, darling, if you insist.

38:17.077 --> 38:18.369
I promise.

38:24.501 --> 38:25.876
I thank you.

38:27.337 --> 38:28.504
Rosie!

38:30.048 --> 38:31.173
Breakfast's up!

38:53.697 --> 38:57.408
- Rosie, are you ready yet?
- What?

38:57.909 --> 39:00.369
I have to see about organizing a car.

39:01.079 --> 39:02.621
I'll see you in the lobby.

39:17.012 --> 39:19.221
Over here, sir. Over here.
Guaranteed big fish.

39:19.305 --> 39:21.515
- Catch big fish, sir.
Hey, baby.

39:21.933 --> 39:25.853
Over here. Bring your man over here.
Just $20. Half a day.

39:25.937 --> 39:28.605
You got warm lady.
We got cold beer over here, man.

39:28.732 --> 39:31.734
You wanna catch a big fish, sir?
It's only 2 pounds over here.

39:37.198 --> 39:38.240
Good morning.

39:38.950 --> 39:41.118
Come on, Rosie.
This one seems eager enough.

39:49.252 --> 39:52.379
Excuse me. Where can I change?

39:55.467 --> 39:58.427
Me. Clothes off. Where?

40:40.178 --> 40:42.096
Stop right there.

40:43.181 --> 40:44.848
Turn around slowly.

40:47.352 --> 40:48.852
Keep your hands up!

40:51.147 --> 40:53.148
As I was saying, Quarrel, a lousy agent.

40:53.233 --> 40:55.567
But the compensations
speak for themselves.

40:56.069 --> 40:59.404
Rosie Carver, meet the man
who shares my hairbrush,

40:59.489 --> 41:00.989
Quarrel Junior.

41:02.242 --> 41:03.700
I'm really sorry.

41:04.035 --> 41:05.452
I could've shot you.

41:05.995 --> 41:09.206
You might have even killed me
if you'd taken off the safety catch.

41:17.799 --> 41:19.049
Never mind, darling.

41:19.467 --> 41:22.803
You just let us know when we get
to the spot where Baines was killed.

41:25.223 --> 41:28.892
It's up in the hills
just after we clear the next cove.

41:40.697 --> 41:44.366
Hey, Quarrel, who the hell lives up there?

41:45.076 --> 41:47.202
That's the house of the Kananga woman.

41:47.287 --> 41:49.454
She's supposed to have
the power of the obeah.

41:49.581 --> 41:52.666
No one on the island
dare go up there except him.

42:00.341 --> 42:01.550
He comes again.

42:02.635 --> 42:03.969
There will be violence.

42:05.471 --> 42:06.805
He approaches even now.

42:07.807 --> 42:08.974
By land or water?

42:09.642 --> 42:10.726
Water.

42:20.945 --> 42:21.987
He has arrived.

42:23.198 --> 42:24.198
Good.

42:25.283 --> 42:27.951
Rosie's been more efficient
than I anticipated.

42:29.245 --> 42:31.622
I know a place
where we can rustle up a car.

42:32.123 --> 42:34.208
Beautiful, brave and now resourceful.

42:34.375 --> 42:36.960
Rosie, you seem to be staging
a remarkable comeback.

42:39.464 --> 42:40.797
Tell me about the future.

42:55.146 --> 42:56.230
Is it death?

42:58.191 --> 42:59.775
I said, is it death?

43:00.652 --> 43:01.777
It is death.

43:06.866 --> 43:08.033
They're coming.

43:09.244 --> 43:10.661
Rosie knows what to do.

43:11.537 --> 43:14.164
Now, I want no bodies this time, no trace.

43:19.087 --> 43:20.587
It's down there.

43:22.090 --> 43:25.842
But I thought you said Baines
was killed up in the hills, darling.

43:28.554 --> 43:30.389
Up in the hills down there.

43:32.100 --> 43:35.269
Why don't we have
a bite of lunch and discuss it?

43:36.396 --> 43:38.563
There's an excellent patty in the hamper.

43:39.482 --> 43:41.024
I'm in no hurry.

43:41.859 --> 43:43.110
Are you?

43:45.446 --> 43:46.446
No.

44:09.679 --> 44:15.559
James, you don't know
what finding you has meant to me.

44:15.935 --> 44:17.519
Oh, I can imagine.

44:17.770 --> 44:20.731
And you've no idea
what finding this has meant to me.

44:22.066 --> 44:25.569
You do know what the Queen of Cups
means in an upside-down position?

44:25.987 --> 44:28.905
A deceitful, perverse woman,
a liar, a cheat.

44:28.990 --> 44:30.699
And I'd like some answers now.

44:31.909 --> 44:33.243
Please.

44:34.120 --> 44:37.164
You don't understand, see.
They'll kill me if I do.

44:37.457 --> 44:39.166
And I'll kill you if you don't.

44:42.170 --> 44:44.296
But you couldn't. You wouldn't.

44:45.089 --> 44:46.882
Not after what we've just done.

44:47.050 --> 44:49.301
I certainly wouldn't have killed you before.

45:01.773 --> 45:05.484
It used to be a convincing act, Rosie.
It's wearing a little thin now.

45:06.110 --> 45:08.862
It's not an act. It's...

45:09.781 --> 45:11.031
Make your choice.

45:21.417 --> 45:25.253
Rosie.

45:59.455 --> 46:01.289
You will explain what went wrong.

46:04.502 --> 46:06.420
I see the intervention of a woman.

46:07.213 --> 46:09.756
The girl was about to confess.
We had to kill her.

46:13.428 --> 46:14.594
The trap was set.

46:16.347 --> 46:17.514
Tee Hee was waiting.

46:20.351 --> 46:21.852
And you saw death.

46:22.353 --> 46:24.271
It must have been the girl's death.

46:25.773 --> 46:27.774
If you do not ask specific questions

46:28.693 --> 46:32.320
I cannot be responsible for
your misinterpretation of the answers.

46:35.366 --> 46:38.577
These growing signs of impertinence
begin to disturb me, Solitaire.

46:38.661 --> 46:40.996
Even as they did
with your mother before you.

46:41.372 --> 46:44.040
She had the power and lost it,
became useless to me.

46:45.001 --> 46:46.710
You will not make the same mistake.

46:48.379 --> 46:49.379
Solitaire.

46:52.675 --> 47:19.409
Where is Bond now?

47:22.830 --> 47:24.873
I cannot see
when you are this way with me.

47:27.084 --> 47:28.793
Things become unclear.

47:29.420 --> 47:32.297
Let us hope these momentary lapses
do not become a habit.

47:33.174 --> 47:35.258
Your power exists to serve me,

47:35.510 --> 47:37.177
and it is mine to control.

47:37.929 --> 47:41.223
If and when the time comes
I decide you are to lose it,

47:41.307 --> 47:43.016
I myself will take it away.

47:49.482 --> 47:51.858
Solitaire, go to sleep.
You have made me angry with you,

47:52.109 --> 47:53.610
and I have no wish to be.

47:54.820 --> 47:55.862
Tee Hee.

49:15.026 --> 49:16.526
Put down those cards.

49:20.197 --> 49:21.656
It is a blasphemy.

49:23.492 --> 49:25.535
They tell nothing to those who cannot see.

49:26.037 --> 49:28.830
But they do. That's a bit of luck.

49:29.415 --> 49:31.041
Good luck for both of us.

49:31.834 --> 49:33.918
The cards say we will be lovers.

49:38.549 --> 49:39.674
You're mistaken.

49:40.968 --> 49:42.886
It's impossible, forbidden for me.

49:44.597 --> 49:45.972
Now you must go.

49:46.557 --> 49:48.391
But you do believe,

49:49.310 --> 49:51.728
I mean really believe, in the cards.

49:54.231 --> 49:56.566
They have never lied to me.

49:57.318 --> 49:58.526
Then they won't now.

50:04.075 --> 50:05.116
Pick one.

50:33.270 --> 50:35.271
You knew the answer before it was given.

50:38.818 --> 50:40.527
Strangely enough, somehow

50:41.779 --> 50:42.821
so did I.

51:18.190 --> 51:19.816
So it's finally happened.

51:21.819 --> 51:23.486
Just as it did to my mother

51:24.321 --> 51:25.822
and her mother before her.

51:28.534 --> 51:30.034
Well, of course it did.

51:31.495 --> 51:34.122
Well, you're visual proof of that,
aren't you?

51:38.586 --> 51:40.628
Come on. Cheer up, darling.

51:42.006 --> 51:44.048
Has to be a first time for everyone.

51:46.594 --> 51:49.512
Now, tell me, where's Kananga?

51:52.224 --> 51:53.975
I cannot see.

51:57.271 --> 51:59.689
- Oh, yes, the cards. I'll get them.
- No.

52:01.734 --> 52:03.568
There's no need to be frightened.

52:04.695 --> 52:06.821
You'll soon be rid of him, I promise.

52:08.616 --> 52:09.741
I promise.

52:11.952 --> 52:16.080
I just need a little bit of information,
that's all.

52:19.001 --> 52:20.502
The power,

52:22.254 --> 52:23.463
I've lost it.

52:26.884 --> 52:28.551
The high priestess

52:29.220 --> 52:31.679
is wife to the prince,
no longer of this world.

52:33.557 --> 52:36.476
The spiritual bridge to the secret church.

52:39.396 --> 52:40.647
It's my fate.

52:42.024 --> 52:44.150
By compelling me to earthly love,

52:45.402 --> 52:47.904
the cards themselves
have taken away my powers.

52:51.325 --> 52:55.370
Darling, I have a small confession to make.

52:55.454 --> 52:57.497
Now, try not to be too upset.

52:59.834 --> 53:02.418
The deck was slightly stacked in my favor.

53:03.879 --> 53:05.255
It makes no difference.

53:06.257 --> 53:08.716
The physical violation cannot be undone.

53:11.595 --> 53:13.763
When he finds out I've lost my power,

53:15.766 --> 53:16.850
he'll kill me.

53:17.768 --> 53:19.936
Now, come on. He'll have to find you first.

53:21.063 --> 53:23.565
Lovers' lesson number one,
we have no secrets.

53:24.942 --> 53:27.151
For example, I have a boat waiting.

53:27.945 --> 53:29.445
You can be on it.

53:30.614 --> 53:32.782
All I have to know before we leave is

53:33.033 --> 53:35.451
what goes on back there in Voodooland.

53:39.373 --> 53:42.417
Darling, three men and a girl have been
killed in the last four days,

53:42.501 --> 53:45.336
not counting the number of times
they've tried to stop me from discovering

53:45.421 --> 53:47.213
whatever Kananga's protecting.

53:47.965 --> 53:50.133
Now, do you want to be
on that boat or not?

53:50.551 --> 53:52.927
I simply read the cards for him.

53:54.305 --> 53:57.682
I've never been there,
and he's never taken me there.

54:09.028 --> 54:10.361
I've never dared to go,

54:11.488 --> 54:12.906
but I've looked in the cards.

54:13.824 --> 54:15.575
I've seen great riches there.

54:17.995 --> 54:19.245
They'll kill you.

54:20.664 --> 54:21.873
Us, darling.

54:22.875 --> 54:24.459
They will kill us.

54:25.169 --> 54:26.711
Lovers' lesson number two,

54:27.296 --> 54:31.132
togetherness till death do us part,
or thereabouts.

54:32.593 --> 54:34.177
Is there time before we leave

54:35.429 --> 54:36.888
for lesson number three?

54:43.062 --> 54:44.145
Absolutely.

54:44.688 --> 54:47.148
There's no sense in going off half-cocked.

55:01.789 --> 55:04.207
- This way.
- How can you be so sure?

55:04.291 --> 55:08.044
Well, these scarecrows are to scare people
away. You're not scared, are you?

55:08.545 --> 55:10.797
Lesson number four,
follow the scarecrows.

55:46.625 --> 55:48.876
- Good morning, boss.
- Good morning.

55:48.961 --> 55:51.546
It's sure gonna be a beautiful day.

55:53.799 --> 55:56.342
Yes, sir, a beautiful day.

56:08.272 --> 56:10.273
They're heading for the hill.

56:13.736 --> 56:14.986
They're here.

56:18.824 --> 56:20.283
If he finds it, kill him.

57:25.557 --> 57:26.849
Quick!

57:37.986 --> 57:40.363
We've lost him. He has the girl.

57:51.416 --> 57:53.292
They're somewhere under the nets.

58:00.008 --> 58:01.509
At any cost, any.

58:01.885 --> 58:03.219
Bond must die.

58:24.116 --> 58:26.075
Unit two-five, we have picked them up.

58:35.294 --> 58:37.753
Base to two-five. Arrest Bond.

58:37.838 --> 58:40.423
But, I repeat, the girl is not to be touched.

58:40.841 --> 58:43.259
Message received and understood.
Over and out.

58:44.136 --> 58:45.428
Base to all units.

58:45.846 --> 58:48.222
I repeat, the girl is not to be touched.

01:01:25.422 --> 01:01:27.340
Sweet mother of pearl.

01:01:27.424 --> 01:01:29.091
All change. End of the line.

01:01:30.719 --> 01:01:32.094
Get down below quickly.

01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:34.263
Here. I'll do that. You get us started.

01:01:43.357 --> 01:01:44.940
It appears a bust.

01:01:52.491 --> 01:01:53.616
James.

01:01:54.951 --> 01:01:57.995
He'll be looking for me now.
I know he'll never stop.

01:01:58.121 --> 01:01:59.497
Come on, darling.

01:02:00.332 --> 01:02:01.499
It's all over.

01:02:04.711 --> 01:02:07.171
Voodooland was just poppy fields.

01:02:07.798 --> 01:02:09.757
A simple matter of heroin smuggling.

01:02:10.675 --> 01:02:13.886
I'll have a word or two with a man named
Felix and turn the entire case over to him.

01:02:13.970 --> 01:02:18.057
And you and I will be off.
By the way, where would you like to go?

01:02:20.018 --> 01:02:22.186
Anywhere where we can find one of these.

01:02:34.074 --> 01:02:35.741
How quickly can we
make it to New Orleans?

01:02:35.826 --> 01:02:38.244
Santa Mina, four hours away.

01:02:38.745 --> 01:02:41.163
You can catch a flight
and be there in the morning.

01:02:41.248 --> 01:02:43.082
Then get in touch with Felix
on the scrambler.

01:02:43.166 --> 01:02:46.210
Tell him to meet me there tomorrow.
Royal Orleans Hotel.

01:02:46.336 --> 01:02:48.003
Tampa is closer.

01:02:48.672 --> 01:02:52.258
Hamilton was killed in New Orleans,
so there has to be a connection.

01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:56.679
And this is a valuable
piece of merchandise we are carrying,

01:02:56.888 --> 01:02:58.931
which with any luck, they'll want back.

01:03:13.488 --> 01:03:15.197
Royal Orleans Hotel, please.

01:03:29.713 --> 01:03:31.589
Are you sure this is
the way to New Orleans?

01:03:31.673 --> 01:03:35.551
I don't know, but it sure beats
the hell out of Harlem, don't it?

01:03:41.183 --> 01:03:45.561
Well, hello, Jim. What's happening, baby?

01:03:47.981 --> 01:03:51.901
Just ease back now, Jim. Relax.

01:03:52.152 --> 01:03:54.111
Mr. Big wants to see you.

01:04:20.013 --> 01:04:22.223
You made a mistake back
on that island, Bond.

01:04:22.474 --> 01:04:24.183
You took something that
didn't belong to you,

01:04:24.434 --> 01:04:26.894
and you took it from a friend of Mr. Big's.

01:04:27.103 --> 01:04:30.231
That type of mistake is
tough to bounce back from.

01:04:33.568 --> 01:04:36.695
- But I've only just arrived.
- Today is your lucky day, Jim.

01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:38.447
You're going skydiving.

01:04:38.949 --> 01:04:41.659
There's a hell of a view of
the lake from 10,000 feet.

01:04:42.077 --> 01:04:44.703
My only regret is I won't be there to see it.

01:05:09.854 --> 01:05:12.398
- Good morning. You're...
- Mrs. Bell. You're not my instructor.

01:05:12.482 --> 01:05:17.069
- Where's Mr. Bleeker?
- Indisposed. I'll be giving the lesson.

01:05:18.947 --> 01:05:20.614
Come on, come on!

01:05:24.119 --> 01:05:25.995
What's on for today?

01:05:26.079 --> 01:05:28.414
Well, let's just wing it, shall we, Mrs. Bell?

01:06:01.281 --> 01:06:02.865
You're over-revving.

01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:11.415
Leroy, slow down!
For Pete's sake, slow down!

01:06:11.499 --> 01:06:14.418
Do what the man say!
I can't find the brake!

01:06:26.097 --> 01:06:27.890
Close those doors!

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:32.603
Holy shit.

01:06:40.904 --> 01:06:42.821
Look out! Look out!

01:06:50.830 --> 01:06:53.666
Okay, Don. Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

01:06:53.917 --> 01:06:57.836
Right. Talk to you later.
I gotta go and give a lesson.

01:07:03.009 --> 01:07:04.718
Same time tomorrow, Mrs. Bell?

01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:08.472
Yes, Mr. Bleeker.

01:07:08.848 --> 01:07:13.310
Yes, sir. Well, I know you just
can't glue the wings back on.

01:07:13.770 --> 01:07:16.480
Now, Mr. Bleeker, I'm sure
there's no reason for name-calling.

01:07:17.190 --> 01:07:18.232
No, that's fine.

01:07:18.316 --> 01:07:19.608
- You can fit the rest this afternoon.
- Right, sir.

01:07:19.693 --> 01:07:20.859
Don't forget the double vents.

01:07:20.944 --> 01:07:22.778
I appreciate she may be
one of your best pupils, yes.

01:07:22.862 --> 01:07:25.531
That'll do nicely. That's a little frantic.
I'll keep the other three.

01:07:25.615 --> 01:07:27.700
- Yes, sir.
- Mr. Bleeker, any suggestion of that kind

01:07:27.784 --> 01:07:29.868
should be forwarded in writing
to Washington.

01:07:29.953 --> 01:07:33.455
- How is Mrs. Bell?
- Intensive care. But she'll pull through.

01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:36.583
Yes, sir. Oh, no, sir, no one's
questioning your patriotism.

01:07:36.668 --> 01:07:38.544
I'm sure you're a veteran, sir.

01:07:39.421 --> 01:07:42.506
Felix, you might find out if there's
a Fillet of Soul restaurant in town.

01:07:42.590 --> 01:07:44.049
James, we're way ahead of you.

01:07:44.134 --> 01:07:46.760
It's on Docker Street.
Strutter's watching it now.

01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:52.408
Hell of a send-off.

01:08:53.368 --> 01:08:54.411
This way.

01:09:11.386 --> 01:09:14.139
- Where's Strutter?
- He's gotta be inside somewhere.

01:09:18.603 --> 01:09:19.978
Two, gentlemen?

01:09:22.273 --> 01:09:24.899
I got a nice booth over here
just against the wall.

01:09:26.402 --> 01:09:29.738
Do you think you could find something
a little closer to the stage?

01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:33.533
- What's wrong with a booth?
- I once had a nasty turn in a booth.

01:09:41.667 --> 01:09:44.461
- Bourbon. No ice, please.
- Two Sazeracs.

01:09:44.837 --> 01:09:48.173
Where's your sense of adventure, James?
This is New Orleans. Relax.

01:09:48.758 --> 01:09:50.509
When you were young

01:09:50.593 --> 01:09:53.386
And your heart was an open book

01:09:54.264 --> 01:09:58.725
You used to say live and let live

01:10:00.228 --> 01:10:02.813
- One of you guys called Felix Leiter?
- Yeah. Right here.

01:10:02.897 --> 01:10:04.857
Telephone call for you. Guy called Strutter.

01:10:04.941 --> 01:10:08.402
Thanks. For a minute there, I thought
Harry was laying down on the job.

01:10:10.905 --> 01:10:26.253
Say live and let die

01:10:31.634 --> 01:10:34.303
What does it matter to ya?

01:10:34.637 --> 01:10:37.848
When you got a job to do,
you got to do it well

01:10:39.183 --> 01:10:42.144
You got to give the other fellow hell

01:10:42.645 --> 01:10:44.146
What happened to my...

01:10:45.148 --> 01:10:47.399
- What happened to my friend?
- What happened to your friend? Listen...

01:10:50.111 --> 01:10:51.695
Thanks for dropping in, baby.

01:10:53.323 --> 01:10:55.657
Yeah, you one tough pig to nail down.

01:10:57.076 --> 01:10:59.661
You've been picking at me
like some kind of maggot.

01:11:00.830 --> 01:11:03.373
First, you go up to Harlem
and kill one of the brothers.

01:11:03.833 --> 01:11:05.125
That disturbed me.

01:11:06.628 --> 01:11:09.087
Well, then you go and steal
this valuable young lady

01:11:09.172 --> 01:11:11.006
from my good friend, Dr. Kananga.

01:11:12.216 --> 01:11:17.012
Now, old Kananga, he believes in all
that card crap. I mean, he's mad.

01:11:18.306 --> 01:11:20.766
Well, possession being
nine points of the law,

01:11:20.850 --> 01:11:23.769
I would say Kananga is your problem now.
Thank you.

01:11:25.813 --> 01:11:29.524
In fact, if I were you,
I'd watch my step from now on.

01:11:31.235 --> 01:11:34.196
Yeah, well, you just let me handle
our business with the man.

01:11:39.577 --> 01:11:42.162
I've got my own plans for you, baby.

01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:45.749
But first,

01:11:46.709 --> 01:11:51.088
there's one little question
that he wants answers for.

01:11:51.172 --> 01:11:54.716
In that case, you'd better ship me back
to the island and let him ask in person.

01:11:55.259 --> 01:11:58.303
I'm not in the habit of
giving answers to lackeys.

01:11:58.721 --> 01:12:01.598
You damn lucky you got a ear left
to hear the question with.

01:12:02.308 --> 01:12:03.350
Which is,

01:12:04.143 --> 01:12:05.769
did you mess with that?

01:12:10.608 --> 01:12:15.153
That's between Solitaire and myself and
Kananga. I'll tell him when I see him.

01:12:15.238 --> 01:12:17.739
You ain't gonna see the sunlight
unless you answer me!

01:12:17.907 --> 01:12:19.950
I had no idea
you were so frightened of him.

01:12:20.034 --> 01:12:24.663
- Did you touch her?
- When I see Kananga.

01:12:25.665 --> 01:12:26.915
Right.

01:12:48.604 --> 01:12:50.022
Quite revealing.

01:12:53.276 --> 01:12:58.071
Kananga, poppy grower in thousands
of acres of well-camouflaged fields

01:12:58.156 --> 01:13:00.782
protected by the voodoo threat
of Baron Samedi.

01:13:03.077 --> 01:13:06.204
And as Mr. Big, distributor and wholesaler

01:13:06.289 --> 01:13:08.582
through a chain of
Fillet of Soul restaurants.

01:13:09.042 --> 01:13:10.333
Wholesale?

01:13:12.628 --> 01:13:14.421
Sell heroin for money?

01:13:14.756 --> 01:13:17.507
My apologies.
I'm sure you simply give it away.

01:13:18.342 --> 01:13:19.634
Excellent, Mr. Bond.

01:13:21.012 --> 01:13:23.055
That's precisely what I intend to do.

01:13:24.057 --> 01:13:25.515
Two tons of it to be exact.

01:13:26.350 --> 01:13:28.810
When entering
into a fiercely competitive field,

01:13:28.895 --> 01:13:31.438
one finds it advisable
to give away free samples.

01:13:31.898 --> 01:13:34.357
Man or woman, black or white.
I don't discriminate.

01:13:36.819 --> 01:13:40.572
Two tons of heroin with a street value
well over a billion dollars,

01:13:40.823 --> 01:13:43.116
nationally distributed free?

01:13:44.535 --> 01:13:48.830
That should make a certain group of
families rather angry, wouldn't you say?

01:13:49.248 --> 01:13:50.290
Angry?

01:13:51.167 --> 01:13:52.626
Why, my dear Mr. Bond,

01:13:53.336 --> 01:13:56.129
it'll positively drive them
out of their minds

01:13:56.214 --> 01:13:58.423
and, subsequently, out of the business.

01:13:58.508 --> 01:14:02.260
Quite ingenious.
A sort of junkie's welfare system.

01:14:02.345 --> 01:14:04.930
Well, merely until the number
of addicts in the country

01:14:05.014 --> 01:14:06.473
has doubled, shall we say.

01:14:07.183 --> 01:14:10.977
Then I will begin to market that acreage
that you blundered into the other day.

01:14:11.062 --> 01:14:16.149
That heroin will be very expensive indeed,
leaving myself and the phone company

01:14:16.234 --> 01:14:19.986
the only two going monopolies
in this nation for years to come.

01:14:21.239 --> 01:14:24.199
And here I thought it was Solitaire
did the fortunetelling.

01:14:25.076 --> 01:14:27.536
Let's hope for both of your sakes
she still can.

01:14:29.997 --> 01:14:33.834
The question still stands, Mr. Bond,
asked by the gentleman concerned.

01:14:36.045 --> 01:14:37.546
Did you touch her?

01:14:38.506 --> 01:14:41.716
Why, it's not the sort of question
a gentleman answers.

01:14:43.427 --> 01:14:45.804
Well, having set the example,

01:14:46.013 --> 01:14:48.890
I don't expect Miss Solitaire
to be any less the lady.

01:14:55.773 --> 01:14:56.815
By the way,

01:14:57.650 --> 01:15:00.735
that's a particularly handsome
watch you're wearing, Mr. Bond.

01:15:01.904 --> 01:15:05.031
- May I see it, please?
- You'll forgive me if I don't get up.

01:15:08.578 --> 01:15:09.828
Butterhook.

01:15:22.592 --> 01:15:23.758
Tee Hee,

01:15:25.344 --> 01:15:30.056
on the first wrong answer
from Miss Solitaire,

01:15:30.141 --> 01:15:33.101
you will snip the little finger
of Mr. Bond's right hand.

01:15:40.359 --> 01:15:42.611
Starting with the second wrong answer,

01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:47.115
you'll proceed to the more vital areas.

01:15:51.537 --> 01:15:54.414
Solitaire, my dear,

01:15:55.291 --> 01:15:58.251
I want you to listen to me very carefully.

01:16:02.256 --> 01:16:06.676
On the back of Mr. Bond's watch,
the registration number

01:16:06.761 --> 01:16:11.932
3-2-6-6.

01:16:18.856 --> 01:16:20.232
Do I speak the truth?

01:16:36.499 --> 01:16:37.832
You speak the truth.

01:16:57.395 --> 01:16:58.561
Well.

01:17:01.274 --> 01:17:04.192
If nothing else, at least
I have laid your fears to rest.

01:17:05.152 --> 01:17:07.570
My compliments on a splendid operation.

01:17:07.697 --> 01:17:09.698
There is one thing, however, the...

01:17:18.249 --> 01:17:20.875
Whisper, take him to the farm.

01:17:50.698 --> 01:17:52.115
When do we start back?

01:17:59.332 --> 01:18:01.958
Soon, Solitaire, soon.

01:18:15.681 --> 01:18:16.931
Solitaire, why?

01:18:17.975 --> 01:18:20.101
I treated you well. You lacked for nothing.

01:18:23.481 --> 01:18:27.817
- I don't understand what you...
- Mr. Bond's watch, my dear.

01:18:28.944 --> 01:18:33.198
I gave you every break possible.
You had a 50-50 chance.

01:18:34.492 --> 01:18:36.159
You weren't even close.

01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:39.454
I had no choice.

01:18:41.457 --> 01:18:43.625
Please believe me. The cards.

01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:07.023
When the time came,
I myself would have given you love.

01:19:08.776 --> 01:19:12.195
You knew that. You knew that!

01:19:15.366 --> 01:19:18.076
There's only one proper way
to deal with this.

01:19:22.915 --> 01:19:24.332
And one proper time.

01:20:33.861 --> 01:20:35.862
The tonnage order is nearly complete.

01:20:40.743 --> 01:20:42.076
We move it out tonight.

01:20:45.915 --> 01:20:47.207
And I mean tonight.

01:20:48.709 --> 01:20:49.751
Mr. Bond.

01:21:01.847 --> 01:21:04.349
How much do you know
about crocodiles, Bond?

01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:08.186
Oh, I've always tried to keep them
at arm's length, myself.

01:21:10.397 --> 01:21:12.065
Cute little nippers, ain't they?

01:21:13.025 --> 01:21:16.236
I don't suppose those potential
overnight bags are orphans?

01:21:16.445 --> 01:21:18.696
Oh, no.
We have some moms and dads, as well.

01:21:24.286 --> 01:21:27.163
In fact, quite a few thousand.

01:21:39.927 --> 01:21:43.054
This is the part I like best, feeding time.

01:21:43.305 --> 01:21:45.974
I suspect the highlight of the tour.

01:22:05.119 --> 01:22:07.704
Some of these babies
live to be 200 years old.

01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:14.085
Look over there.

01:22:15.504 --> 01:22:18.965
That's an alligator.
You can always tell by its round nose.

01:22:22.845 --> 01:22:24.262
There's old Albert.

01:22:24.471 --> 01:22:25.597
He's a croc.

01:22:26.265 --> 01:22:30.226
Got over-careless with him sometime
back and he took my whole arm off.

01:22:31.186 --> 01:22:35.815
- Well done, Albert.
- They'll eat anything, even each other.

01:22:37.401 --> 01:22:40.403
Then again, sometime they can go
a whole year without eating.

01:22:42.948 --> 01:22:44.574
Oh, I was rather counting on that.

01:22:44.658 --> 01:22:47.410
There are two ways
to disable a crocodile, you know.

01:22:52.958 --> 01:22:56.669
I don't suppose you care
to share that information with me?

01:22:56.754 --> 01:23:01.132
One way is to take a pencil and jam it
in the depression hole behind his eyes.

01:23:01.383 --> 01:23:02.508
And the other?

01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:05.053
Oh, the other is twice as simple.

01:23:07.056 --> 01:23:09.349
You just put your hand in his mouth

01:23:09.433 --> 01:23:10.933
and pull his teeth out.

01:25:56.558 --> 01:25:58.392
It's on fire!

01:26:06.235 --> 01:26:07.819
Adam, get him!

01:26:07.903 --> 01:26:11.447
Adam, get the car! Cut him off!
Hector, move, damn it!

01:26:26.088 --> 01:26:30.341
Bond ripped off one of our boats!
He's headed for the Irish Bayou.

01:26:30.425 --> 01:26:32.635
The man that gets him stays alive.

01:26:32.719 --> 01:26:34.595
Now, move, you mother...

01:27:42.164 --> 01:27:43.331
Toby!

01:27:44.333 --> 01:27:48.586
Toby, I got me a regular
Ben-Hur down here

01:27:48.962 --> 01:27:51.589
doing 95 minimum.

01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:55.343
- Need any help, J.W.?
- Hell, no!

01:28:33.674 --> 01:28:36.384
You got a set of wheels
that just won't quit, boy.

01:28:36.802 --> 01:28:39.178
If they're yours, that is.

01:28:39.554 --> 01:28:43.641
You spin around, boy.
Ten fingers on the fender.

01:28:47.646 --> 01:28:49.063
Legs apart.

01:28:51.733 --> 01:28:55.861
I'm sure this ain't exactly
your debut with this sort of thing.

01:28:57.906 --> 01:29:01.867
You picked the wrong parish
to haul ass through, boy.

01:29:02.577 --> 01:29:06.247
Nobody cuts and runs
on Sheriff J.W. Pepper.

01:29:07.249 --> 01:29:10.167
And it's him speaking, by the by.

01:29:17.467 --> 01:29:19.010
What the...

01:29:48.457 --> 01:29:52.126
J.W., soon as you nail
that offending vehicle,

01:29:52.627 --> 01:29:54.545
Miss Pearson just called.

01:29:55.130 --> 01:29:57.923
Seems her dog's foaming all at the mouth.

01:29:58.759 --> 01:30:00.676
She's got him locked up in her shed,

01:30:01.011 --> 01:30:04.180
wondering if you'd like to come over
and shoot it for her.

01:30:07.642 --> 01:30:10.144
You tell Miss Pearson take a flying...

01:30:12.689 --> 01:30:15.983
That look like a boat stuck
in the sheriff's car there, Eddie?

01:30:16.068 --> 01:30:19.737
Boy, where you been all your life?
That there's one of them new car-boats.

01:30:20.155 --> 01:30:24.450
By the powers invested in me
by this parish

01:30:25.368 --> 01:30:28.454
I hereby do commandeer this vehicle

01:30:28.538 --> 01:30:30.706
and all those persons within.

01:30:33.335 --> 01:30:36.462
And that means you, smartass.

01:31:58.086 --> 01:31:59.795
Unit 23 in position.

01:32:00.213 --> 01:32:02.423
Ten-four, 23. Come in, 28.

01:32:02.632 --> 01:32:05.342
Hey, J.W., seems like Deke Rogers

01:32:05.427 --> 01:32:07.636
done got his boat stole off the river.

01:32:07.804 --> 01:32:09.847
But picked up a new one
in his swimming pool.

01:32:09.931 --> 01:32:12.516
Sheriff, you want
to get your boys off our frequency?

01:32:12.601 --> 01:32:15.895
Give me that!
Now you listen to me, trooper boy!

01:32:15.979 --> 01:32:18.647
We got a swamp full of black Russians

01:32:18.899 --> 01:32:21.859
driving boats to beat the dam down here!

01:32:21.943 --> 01:32:25.404
Relax, Sheriff. We've got a roadblock
waiting for them at Miller's Bridge.

01:32:27.782 --> 01:32:31.702
Unit 26 at Miller's Bridge.
We're just about all set here.

01:32:31.786 --> 01:32:34.038
Make that secure there, you hear?

01:32:37.876 --> 01:32:40.044
Okay, fellas, here they come.

01:32:54.559 --> 01:32:57.269
All right, out of my way!
I'm in charge here!

01:32:57.354 --> 01:32:58.854
You two boys, come on!

01:33:04.319 --> 01:33:07.279
I don't want excuses, trooper.
I want those two men and their boats

01:33:07.364 --> 01:33:10.157
- apprehended immediately, did you hear?
- Yes, sir, Captain.

01:33:10.492 --> 01:33:12.826
I understand. But I don't know right off

01:33:12.911 --> 01:33:15.079
where we're going to find
a boat fast enough to catch them.

01:33:15.163 --> 01:33:17.623
I got it.
You call my brother-in-law Billy Bob.

01:33:17.707 --> 01:33:21.085
He got the fastest boat
on the whole damn river.

01:33:21.169 --> 01:33:25.506
Billy Bob will sure enough fix
their ass, huh? Yeah, call Billy Bob.

01:33:31.846 --> 01:33:33.931
Now, there's two boats, Billy Bob,

01:33:34.015 --> 01:33:36.183
and they're moving like buttered pigs.

01:33:36.434 --> 01:33:38.936
Now, I promised these boys here
you would get them.

01:33:39.020 --> 01:33:42.398
- Don't let me down, hear?
- Cool down, J.W. I'm on my way.

01:33:43.692 --> 01:33:47.486
- You want something, boy?
- Yes, I'd like to borrow this boat, if I may.

01:33:47.570 --> 01:33:50.072
Everybody on the river
would like to borrow this boat.

01:33:53.034 --> 01:33:55.828
Billy Bob, we got them spotted.

01:33:55.912 --> 01:33:58.664
They're headed for Haley's Landing.

01:34:12.762 --> 01:34:15.431
That's my brother-in-law! That's Billy Bob!

01:34:15.515 --> 01:34:17.474
He'll get them. Billy Bob'll get them.

01:34:19.686 --> 01:34:21.061
Hot damn!

01:34:21.146 --> 01:34:24.690
If one side of the Pepper family
don't get them, the other side will.

01:34:24.774 --> 01:34:25.816
Let's go!

01:35:23.500 --> 01:35:25.459
If any man can show just cause

01:35:26.044 --> 01:35:28.087
why they may not
lawfully be joined together

01:35:28.171 --> 01:35:30.464
let him now speak, or else hereafter...

01:35:54.572 --> 01:35:57.032
Headquarters to all units, suspects seen

01:35:57.117 --> 01:36:00.077
proceeding down via Liberty
towards Highway 11.

01:36:00.203 --> 01:36:01.578
Proceed with caution.

01:36:05.166 --> 01:36:07.835
Would you get that
chicken coop off the road?

01:36:10.380 --> 01:36:13.465
Did you ever think of getting
a driver's license, boy?

01:37:04.392 --> 01:37:07.102
Are you sure that was
your brother-in-law, Sheriff?

01:39:21.154 --> 01:39:24.156
- Hello, Felix. What are you doing here?
- We'll get to that later.

01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:27.034
Kananga's in town. He's got
your girl with him. They just took off.

01:39:30.872 --> 01:39:33.206
There's the son of a bitch!
I got him!

01:39:37.712 --> 01:39:39.254
What are you?

01:39:39.547 --> 01:39:43.008
Some kind of doomsday machine, boy?

01:39:43.426 --> 01:39:47.554
Well, we got a cage strong enough
to hold an animal like you here.

01:39:47.639 --> 01:39:50.015
Captain, would you enlighten
the sheriff please?

01:39:50.099 --> 01:39:51.141
Yes, sir.

01:39:51.225 --> 01:39:53.352
J.W., let me have a word with you.

01:39:54.687 --> 01:39:57.814
J.W., now, this fella's
from London, England.

01:39:57.899 --> 01:40:01.151
He's an Englishman working
in cooperation with our boys,

01:40:01.235 --> 01:40:02.694
a sort of secret agent.

01:40:02.779 --> 01:40:04.780
Secret agent?

01:40:05.740 --> 01:40:07.866
On whose side?

01:40:08.242 --> 01:40:10.202
We busted the Fillet of Soul an hour ago.

01:40:10.286 --> 01:40:12.287
We came up with nothing but these.

01:40:14.082 --> 01:40:16.249
Kananga's clear. You should have seen

01:40:16.334 --> 01:40:18.251
the size of the guy
who got on the boat with him.

01:40:18.336 --> 01:40:20.128
Nine feet tall, I swear.

01:40:20.463 --> 01:40:24.675
Big top hat, a cockamamie flute in
one hand and Solitaire in the other.

01:40:55.164 --> 01:40:57.457
The incendiary bombs
are set for midnight.

01:40:58.126 --> 01:41:01.753
Now, that gives you exactly 30 minutes.

01:41:04.048 --> 01:41:06.299
Watch out for sharks on the way back.

01:41:06.384 --> 01:41:09.886
- I'll see you for breakfast, Felix.
- Good hunting.

01:41:27.405 --> 01:41:30.407
You're going to need these
and the shark gun on the way back.

01:41:33.327 --> 01:41:37.164
- Seems like the party's started.
- My regards to Baron Samedi, man,

01:41:37.248 --> 01:41:38.957
right between the eyes.

01:48:02.049 --> 01:48:03.049
Trouble!

01:49:07.406 --> 01:49:11.743
Ah, Mr. Bond, there you are!
And Miss Solitaire, as well.

01:49:11.827 --> 01:49:13.953
Hardly unexpected, but most welcome.

01:49:14.455 --> 01:49:15.788
Whisper!

01:49:16.248 --> 01:49:18.166
Two more glasses for our guests!

01:49:19.376 --> 01:49:23.296
- What shall we drink to, Mr. Bond?
- Well, how about an earthquake?

01:49:33.641 --> 01:49:35.141
Welcome home!

01:49:35.226 --> 01:49:37.602
- Where's our boy?
- He'll be along anytime now.

01:49:37.811 --> 01:49:40.188
I checked behind a rock,
and his wet suit is gone.

01:49:42.149 --> 01:49:43.233
Keep the change.

01:49:47.696 --> 01:49:49.864
It's unfortunate that
your wet suit was discovered

01:49:49.949 --> 01:49:51.824
only minutes before
the field was destroyed.

01:49:52.201 --> 01:49:57.038
- Don't tell me you're not insured.
- No. The poppy's a very sturdy flower.

01:49:57.331 --> 01:50:00.708
You have been a relatively minor nuisance,
in fact.

01:50:00.834 --> 01:50:02.168
But this gun...

01:50:02.836 --> 01:50:06.005
I find it particularly fascinating. What is it?

01:50:07.383 --> 01:50:11.094
A shark gun, naturally,
with compressed gas pellets.

01:50:34.660 --> 01:50:36.369
Ingenious!

01:50:36.787 --> 01:50:39.247
Don't pull the pin out.

01:50:39.665 --> 01:50:41.833
The air in here is foul enough already.

01:50:43.585 --> 01:50:46.629
Somehow I never thought of you
as a poor loser.

01:50:46.714 --> 01:50:49.257
I was hoping you would join me
to a drink to the future.

01:50:49.341 --> 01:50:51.592
Oh, Miss Solitaire used to
know all about the future.

01:50:51.677 --> 01:50:54.262
She was especially good
at predicting death.

01:50:58.475 --> 01:51:00.059
An underground monorail.

01:51:01.687 --> 01:51:04.355
Connected to the last refuge
of a scoundrel, no doubt.

01:51:06.900 --> 01:51:10.278
The heroin leaves here, I take it,
carried somewhere by that winch.

01:51:10.654 --> 01:51:13.281
Correct again, Mr. Bond.
What a quick study you are.

01:51:13.782 --> 01:51:15.450
Let me show you exactly how it works.

01:51:16.368 --> 01:51:19.078
- Where in hell can the man be?
- Relax.

01:51:19.163 --> 01:51:21.039
He must have got tied up somewhere.

01:51:22.458 --> 01:51:24.959
These cans hold 25 pounds each.

01:51:25.919 --> 01:51:29.339
There are 20 cans to a shipment,
packed in watertight...

01:51:31.508 --> 01:51:32.842
Metal containers.

01:51:33.761 --> 01:51:35.178
It's your show, Kananga,

01:51:35.262 --> 01:51:38.181
but I'm sure there must be a simpler way
of drowning someone.

01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:43.853
Drown, Mr. Bond?
I doubt you'll get the chance to drown.

01:52:21.141 --> 01:52:23.476
Perhaps we could try something
in an even simpler vein.

01:52:23.769 --> 01:52:25.645
On the contrary, Mr. Bond.

01:52:26.480 --> 01:52:28.815
I think you'll find those wounds quite fatal.

01:53:13.861 --> 01:53:14.902
Whisper.

01:53:17.114 --> 01:53:18.197
The gate.

01:53:21.577 --> 01:53:24.412
Oh, slowly, Whisper! Slowly, slowly.

01:53:24.580 --> 01:53:26.706
Let our diners assemble.

01:54:14.046 --> 01:54:15.213
Look out!

01:55:14.815 --> 01:55:16.023
Where's Kananga?

01:55:16.108 --> 01:55:19.151
Well, he always did have
an inflated opinion of himself.

01:55:24.908 --> 01:55:25.908
Oh, James,

01:55:27.411 --> 01:55:29.161
how do we get out of here?

01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:31.747
We take the train, of course.

01:55:34.084 --> 01:55:35.876
Well, thanks for everything, Felix.

01:55:35.961 --> 01:55:38.087
I'll see you tomorrow night at the 21 Club,
and don't be late.

01:55:38.171 --> 01:55:40.131
I still don't see why you want to travel
this way.

01:55:40.215 --> 01:55:43.342
I mean, what the hell can the two
of you do on the train for 16 hours?

01:55:45.345 --> 01:55:47.096
Say goodbye to Felix, darling.

01:55:58.734 --> 01:56:00.610
Now, the first thing to learn
in playing gin rummy

01:56:00.694 --> 01:56:03.195
is to never take a card
from the exposed pile,

01:56:03.322 --> 01:56:04.739
unless you really need it.

01:56:11.455 --> 01:56:12.538
Gin.

01:56:17.711 --> 01:56:20.129
James, what are you doing?

01:56:23.342 --> 01:56:25.176
Just testing an old adage.

01:56:25.886 --> 01:56:27.595
Unlucky at cards...

01:56:50.202 --> 01:56:53.037
- Do hurry up, James.
- Won't be a moment, darling.

01:57:21.483 --> 01:57:24.151
Lock the door as well on your way up,
would you, James?

01:57:26.613 --> 01:57:27.613
After all,

01:57:28.240 --> 01:57:31.200
we wouldn't want anyone
to just walk in on us, would we?

01:57:37.040 --> 01:57:39.959
The first time in my life,
I feel like a complete woman.

01:57:42.295 --> 01:57:44.505
The slightest touch of your hand,

01:57:45.716 --> 01:57:49.301
I was always so afraid that a part
of me would stay with the past.

01:57:50.137 --> 01:57:53.305
But now I know there's no chance
of that any longer.

01:57:53.473 --> 01:57:56.642
Just to be able to reach out and touch you.

01:58:00.188 --> 01:58:02.606
Mr. Bond, it's good to see you again.

01:59:52.425 --> 01:59:54.426
Well, that wasn't very funny.

01:59:57.138 --> 01:59:58.764
Now what are you doing?

02:00:03.562 --> 02:00:05.396
Just being disarming, darling.

02:00:18.618 --> 02:00:20.327
When you were young

02:00:20.412 --> 02:00:24.456
And your heart was an open book

02:00:26.793 --> 02:00:30.796
You used to say live and let live

02:00:31.089 --> 02:00:34.884
You know you did, you know you did
You know you did

02:00:35.218 --> 02:00:40.973
But if this ever-changing world
in which we live in

02:00:41.141 --> 02:00:45.644
Makes you give in and cry

02:00:47.981 --> 02:00:50.190
Say live and let die

02:00:53.194 --> 02:01:03.329
Live and let die

02:01:04.305 --> 02:01:10.313
