¶ Now, my heart,
it beats for You ¶

00:11.112 --> 00:12.578
¶ My Lord ¶

00:14.515 --> 00:17.549
¶ Now, my heart,
it beats for You ¶

00:21.055 --> 00:24.356

00:27.528 --> 00:30.562
¶ Now, my heart,
it beats for You ¶

00:30.564 --> 00:32.798
¶ My Lord ¶

00:34.268 --> 00:37.569
¶ Now, my heart,
it beats for You ¶

00:37.571 --> 00:39.805
¶ My Lord ¶

00:41.375 --> 00:44.510
Hey, John?
John?

00:44.512 --> 00:46.345
Yeah?

00:46.347 --> 00:49.581
They offered me the job
at WaterStep Design.

00:49.583 --> 00:51.784
- That is great news!
- I know!

00:51.786 --> 00:54.153
Mom, eat your dinner.

00:54.155 --> 00:57.423
Who are you?
What are you doing in my house?

00:57.425 --> 00:59.124
I am so proud of you.

00:59.126 --> 01:00.426
I know.

01:00.428 --> 01:02.161
It's an amazing opportunity
for me.

01:02.163 --> 01:05.731
Walt, what is that woman
doing in our house?

01:05.733 --> 01:07.466
I can't believe
they gave me the job

01:07.468 --> 01:09.401
over all those kids
who applied.

01:09.403 --> 01:12.704
Loretta. Loretta, I'm John.
I'm your son-in-law.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.273
It's okay.

01:14.275 --> 01:16.575
Just eat your peas.

01:17.778 --> 01:20.279
- I am not surprised at all.
- Walt!

01:20.281 --> 01:22.781
What are you talking about?

01:22.783 --> 01:24.216
Besides, it might be
kind of nice

01:24.218 --> 01:25.484
to get some time
away from your mom.

01:25.486 --> 01:26.585
Mom.

01:27.755 --> 01:30.155
It's okay.

01:31.492 --> 01:34.326
This chicken is overcooked.

01:34.328 --> 01:36.662
I just want to go home.

01:36.664 --> 01:39.598
You are home, Mom.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.366
My home's a lot nicer
than this place.

01:44.105 --> 01:46.438
- So, when do you start?
- Next week.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.873
No.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.842
It's Beau.

01:49.844 --> 01:52.277
Hey, honey.
Any update?

01:52.279 --> 01:53.412
<i>Hey, Mom.</i>

01:53.414 --> 01:54.680
<i>- Is Dad there?</i>
- Yeah.

01:54.682 --> 01:56.381
No, it's Ravyn.

01:56.383 --> 01:57.850
It'll be fine.
It'll be fine.

01:57.852 --> 02:00.119
<i>Can you guys hear me?</i>

02:00.121 --> 02:01.487
Yeah, I can hear you, kiddo.
What's up?

02:01.489 --> 02:03.355
<i>I have something</i>
<i>to tell you guys.</i>

02:03.357 --> 02:04.690
<i>- Mom, am I on speakerphone?</i>
- Yeah, he can hear you.

02:04.692 --> 02:06.825
<i>Put me on speakerphone.</i>
<i>I'm engaged!</i>

02:06.827 --> 02:08.160
- What?!
- Wait, what?

02:08.162 --> 02:10.229
You're engaged!
Ravyn's engaged.

02:10.231 --> 02:12.764
<i>- I can't hear you guys. Um...</i>
- Beau, your sister's engaged.

02:12.766 --> 02:14.766
<i>- Can Dad hear me? Mom?</i>
- Yeah. I can hear you.

02:14.768 --> 02:16.301
She's on the phone
with Ravyn.

02:16.303 --> 02:18.403
<i>It's official.</i>

02:18.405 --> 02:20.506
<i>They terminated my contract.</i>

02:20.508 --> 02:21.640
<i>I'm never gonna play again.</i>

02:21.642 --> 02:23.909
Oh, Beau, I'm so sorry.

02:23.911 --> 02:25.777
<i>Did you guys hear me?</i>
<i>Hello?</i>

02:25.779 --> 02:27.412
So it's over?

02:27.414 --> 02:30.249
<i>No, it's not over.</i>
<i>I'm getting married.</i>

02:30.251 --> 02:31.917
Yes!
No, yes, you are!

02:31.919 --> 02:34.453
Who are you marrying?

02:34.455 --> 02:36.488
- <i>I'm coming home!</i>
- <i>I'm coming home.</i>

02:38.000 --> 02:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:45.866 --> 02:47.666
Who are you?

03:14.562 --> 03:17.229
I got her to settle down.

03:17.231 --> 03:19.698
- Thank you, honey.
- What's this?

03:19.700 --> 03:23.268
I started this
when Ravyn was five.

03:23.270 --> 03:25.370
Our little girl
is getting married.

03:25.372 --> 03:28.740
I know.
I can't believe it.

03:28.742 --> 03:30.375
And we haven't even
met the guy.

03:30.377 --> 03:33.545
And Beau -- I --
I can't believe that.

03:33.547 --> 03:34.446
What are we gonna do?

03:34.448 --> 03:35.714
I mean, what are the odds

03:35.716 --> 03:38.217
that this would happen
at the same time?

03:38.219 --> 03:39.718
And I've been wanting to plan
this wedding

03:39.720 --> 03:41.353
since Ravyn was born.

03:41.355 --> 03:42.654
- Plan it?
- Yes!

03:42.656 --> 03:44.990
Uh, your mom's
a full-time job.

03:44.992 --> 03:46.858
You just got
your dream career.

03:46.860 --> 03:50.629
I can plan Ravyn's wedding
and take care of my mother.

03:50.631 --> 03:53.398
Well, maybe it's time
for a full-time caregiver.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.600
Okay, part-time.

03:54.602 --> 03:56.368
We've been over this
a million times.

03:56.370 --> 03:58.437
I'm not gonna have a stranger
take care of my mother.

03:58.439 --> 04:00.272
Let's get a wedding planner.

04:00.274 --> 04:02.975
I'm not gonna have a stranger
plan my daughter's wedding.

04:04.278 --> 04:07.246
Well, babe, if you try to do it
all, you're gonna miss it all.

04:07.248 --> 04:09.681
I am not gonna miss
one moment.

04:09.683 --> 04:12.551
I just don't think
that you can do all of this

04:12.553 --> 04:14.353
and be in the moment.

04:14.355 --> 04:15.554
You have to let go
of something.

04:25.466 --> 04:27.266
Okay, Thursday, 9:00 a.m.

04:28.669 --> 04:30.969
1-2-4...

04:33.340 --> 04:37.809
I'm sorry,
can you repeat the address?

04:37.811 --> 04:39.878
1-3-4.
1...

04:39.880 --> 04:41.747
I'm stuck!

04:41.749 --> 04:44.283
I'm stuck!

04:44.285 --> 04:47.019
Got it.
Thank you so much.

04:47.021 --> 04:48.787
I'll see you then.
Bye.

04:53.927 --> 04:56.495
Mom.
Mom, hold still.

04:56.497 --> 04:59.331
Oh, you're not wearing
any makeup, Alexa.

04:59.333 --> 05:00.465
Mom, stop.

05:00.467 --> 05:05.037
You look tired.

05:05.039 --> 05:08.006
You need some more rest.

05:08.008 --> 05:09.808
Oh!

05:09.810 --> 05:11.410
- It's too tight.
- I'm sorry.

05:11.412 --> 05:13.345
Oh, you never
tie it right anyway.

05:13.347 --> 05:17.416
It should be
left over right.

05:18.319 --> 05:18.917
Le--

05:20.321 --> 05:23.655
What are you putting
my shoes on for, anyway?

05:23.657 --> 05:27.626
I'm going to bed.
It's -- It's bedtime.

05:27.628 --> 05:29.594
It's morning, Mom.

05:29.596 --> 05:32.664
You just woke up, and we are
going to have breakfast.

05:34.068 --> 05:36.001
I don't want my shoes on!

05:36.003 --> 05:37.703
Mom, are you okay?

05:37.705 --> 05:39.738
Grandma, what are you doing
beating up on my mom?

05:39.740 --> 05:41.106
Beau?

05:41.108 --> 05:43.675
My favorite football star!

05:43.677 --> 05:45.010
How's my favorite grandma?

05:45.012 --> 05:46.778
Oh, better.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.549
That was fast.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.918
Yeah, well, there's no need
to prolong the inevitable.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.087
Is Grandma getting worse?

05:55.089 --> 05:58.790
How about we all go
grab some breakfast, yeah?

06:00.494 --> 06:01.893
Oh.

06:01.895 --> 06:04.863
I'm sorry, son.
I didn't catch your name.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.765
Grandma.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.633
Oh!

06:08.635 --> 06:10.902
Geez.

06:17.111 --> 06:19.544
Here you go, Mom.

06:19.546 --> 06:21.546
You like that.

06:28.856 --> 06:30.622
Thanks, Mom.

06:32.826 --> 06:33.925
We're gonna get
a second opinion.

06:33.927 --> 06:35.494
That was my third.

06:36.497 --> 06:39.398
There's nothing they can do.
It's blown.

06:40.134 --> 06:42.534
Hey, look at me.

06:43.170 --> 06:44.770
Look at me.

06:46.140 --> 06:47.939
Do not give up.

06:47.941 --> 06:52.010
I didn't give up.
They let me off the team.

06:52.012 --> 06:53.712
You think
this was my choice?

06:53.714 --> 06:58.717
Mom, what am I gonna do now?

06:59.920 --> 07:02.053
- Hello!
- Oh!

07:02.990 --> 07:04.756
- Hi!
- Look!

07:04.758 --> 07:06.458
Isn't it gorgeous?

07:06.460 --> 07:09.961
Wow, it's gorgeous.
So who gave it to you?

07:09.963 --> 07:13.532
So I was thinking we could
get married in your backyard

07:13.534 --> 07:14.900
under the arch
that you and Dad did.

07:14.902 --> 07:16.501
- Wouldn't that be so special?
- Yeah.

07:16.503 --> 07:18.437
- Do you still have it?
- Yeah, I think so.

07:18.439 --> 07:19.704
I'll ask your dad.

07:19.706 --> 07:21.706
Hey!
What, no love for your brother?

07:23.110 --> 07:24.709
Ravyn, who...

07:24.711 --> 07:26.711
Mm!

07:26.713 --> 07:28.079
Look!

07:29.883 --> 07:31.850
Look at this.

07:31.852 --> 07:33.785
I know.
I'm so sorry, Beau.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.554
I swear I felt it too
when you got hurt.

07:35.556 --> 07:38.857
Ravyn, seriously,
who are you marrying?

07:38.859 --> 07:40.091
Uh...

07:40.093 --> 07:41.493
You didn't tell Mom?

07:41.495 --> 07:42.894
You know?

07:42.896 --> 07:45.230
I don't know
how to tell you this.

07:45.232 --> 07:47.632
Wait till you hear
who it is.

07:48.836 --> 07:50.869
- It's Nathan Adams.
- What?

07:50.871 --> 07:53.205
It just happened.

07:53.207 --> 07:55.006
- Nathan Adams?
- Yeah.

07:55.008 --> 07:56.741
My best friend
from high school, Mom.

07:56.743 --> 07:58.877
- You don't remember?
- Jezi's son Nathan?

07:58.879 --> 08:00.612
- Mm-hmm.
- Wow.

08:00.614 --> 08:03.515
Hey, look who I found
taking a stroll on the street.

08:03.517 --> 08:05.550
What did I miss?

08:06.019 --> 08:07.786
Look, Dad! I'm engaged.

08:28.275 --> 08:30.675
Hi, I'm Brent.
You interviewed with my partner.

08:30.677 --> 08:34.179
- It's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.280
Things have really changed.

08:36.283 --> 08:38.216
Does everyone sit together?

08:38.217 --> 08:41.119
We believe creativity
is fostered by shared energy.

08:41.121 --> 08:42.854
That's why we donate
10 % of our profits

08:42.856 --> 08:44.756
to provide clean water
for the world.

08:44.758 --> 08:46.958
Looking forward to see how you
contribute to the culture here.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.760
Well, thank you.

08:48.762 --> 08:51.062
And thank you for taking
a chance on an old lady like me.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.199
- I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.668
- Do you need to get it?
- Okay.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.937
We just dock your pay
for each personal call.

08:58.939 --> 09:01.540
I'm so sorry.
I...

09:01.542 --> 09:02.941
That was a joke.

09:03.944 --> 09:05.610
Let me show you to your desk.

09:11.818 --> 09:13.985
Right here.

09:16.757 --> 09:19.291
This is your desk.
Can I see your designs?

09:19.293 --> 09:21.293
- Yeah.
- Uh, we're all digital here.

09:21.295 --> 09:23.161
Do you have this layout
on a thumb drive?

09:23.163 --> 09:25.630
Um, well, I showed this
sketchbook at my interviews.

09:25.632 --> 09:27.332
Yeah, and we loved them.

09:27.334 --> 09:29.868
Do you think you can have those
e-mailed to everyone by lunch?

09:29.870 --> 09:31.670
Okay.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.638
Oh, wait!
So where's my computer?

09:33.640 --> 09:35.574
Everyone brings their own.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.277
My daughter is getting married

10:12.279 --> 10:14.245
to my ex-best-friend's son.

10:14.247 --> 10:15.814
I mean, no wonder
they didn't tell me.

10:15.816 --> 10:18.083
I already know him.

10:18.085 --> 10:21.820
And they were keeping it
a secret from me.

10:21.822 --> 10:25.991
So, my son lost his career,
my mother keeps running away,

10:25.993 --> 10:27.392
my daughter's getting married,

10:27.394 --> 10:30.829
and I literally just started
my dream job.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.764
I mean, it's a lot.

10:34.368 --> 10:37.769
And I have to be in-laws
with <i>that</i> woman?

10:38.405 --> 10:41.673
And all John can
say is, "Live in the moment."

10:41.675 --> 10:44.676
Sometimes husbands can be
so good at minimizing things,

10:44.678 --> 10:46.044
even when they don't mean to.

10:46.046 --> 10:47.946
I am sure
he did not mean that.

10:47.948 --> 10:49.981
Ugh, whoever came up
with that expression

10:49.983 --> 10:54.119
lived in the middle of nowhere
with no husband or kids or job

10:54.121 --> 10:55.353
or a parent to care for.

10:55.355 --> 10:56.955
Or a grocery list.

10:56.957 --> 10:59.157
Jael, may I please grab my phone
so I can Google

10:59.159 --> 11:01.793
who came up with the expression
"Live in the moment"?

11:01.795 --> 11:03.428
No.
No, phones stay in the basket.

11:03.430 --> 11:06.698
But didn't God come up with that
"live in the moment" thing?

11:06.700 --> 11:08.199
I think it's a Jesus saying.

11:08.201 --> 11:10.935
You know what? Let's do it
the old-fashioned way.

11:10.937 --> 11:12.937
The Bible is better
than Google, right?

11:12.939 --> 11:14.939
I'll do it.

11:14.941 --> 11:16.408
And God is the author of time.

11:16.410 --> 11:18.677
Well, yeah,
'cause he lives beyond time.

11:18.679 --> 11:20.845
So, how do we do it
in real time?

11:20.847 --> 11:23.982
He provides opportunity
for us to ask for help.

11:23.984 --> 11:25.417
You could hire help.

11:25.419 --> 11:26.851
Maybe it's time
to start thinking about

11:26.853 --> 11:28.153
some nursing-home options?

11:28.155 --> 11:29.354
No.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.322
What if something
happens to her?

11:31.324 --> 11:34.359
No, I promised myself I wouldn't
put her in a nursing home

11:34.361 --> 11:36.995
after I missed the death
of my father.

11:36.997 --> 11:40.265
Well, Philippians 4:19 says,

11:40.267 --> 11:43.201
"And my God will meet all
your needs according to

11:43.203 --> 11:45.737
His glorious riches
in Christ Jesus."

11:45.739 --> 11:48.239
If I had glorious riches,
I'd have a maid.

11:48.241 --> 11:51.209
A chef, a gardener.

11:51.211 --> 11:54.179
A personal chauffeur,
a nanny,

11:54.181 --> 11:56.848
and a personal assistant.

11:56.850 --> 11:59.050
It's God's glorious riches.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.886
- Well, maybe He should share.
- Yeah.

12:01.888 --> 12:03.288
He does!

12:03.290 --> 12:05.724
In fact, this week's study
asks the question,

12:05.726 --> 12:08.226
"What am I doing here?"

12:08.228 --> 12:10.228
God wants to provide
for so much more

12:10.230 --> 12:12.230
than just our physical needs.

12:12.232 --> 12:17.035
He wants us to know that
He sees us right where we are.

12:17.971 --> 12:20.371
He loves us so much.

12:20.373 --> 12:24.008
And he just wants
to fill our hearts.

12:24.010 --> 12:25.810
You know, when we left Elijah,

12:25.812 --> 12:27.212
he was on the mountain
of the Lord

12:27.214 --> 12:30.181
with the promise
that God would pass by.

12:31.218 --> 12:35.220
There was a great wind,
but God was not in the wind.

12:35.222 --> 12:38.757
There was a fire,
but God was not in that fire.

12:38.759 --> 12:40.825
There was even an earthquake,

12:40.827 --> 12:43.495
but God wasn't
in the earthquake.

12:43.497 --> 12:47.799
God was in the gentle whisper.

12:47.801 --> 12:53.071
He said to Elijah,
"What are you doing here?"

12:57.310 --> 12:59.177
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
There are directions.

12:59.179 --> 13:01.412
Well, it says
to color in our tree

13:01.414 --> 13:03.181
for the season
that we're in right now.

13:03.183 --> 13:04.816
It's September,
so obviously it's fall.

13:04.818 --> 13:06.284
Okay, yes, true.

13:06.286 --> 13:10.355
But it means the season of life
that we are in.

13:10.357 --> 13:15.960
So spring is a time
of learning, opportunity,

13:15.962 --> 13:17.796
and fresh thought.

13:17.798 --> 13:22.300
Summer is a time of rewards,
celebration, and fulfillment.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.169
Now, that is really the time
to celebrate

13:24.171 --> 13:26.171
because everything is blooming.

13:26.173 --> 13:30.308
Fall, or autumn,
is a time of change,

13:30.310 --> 13:31.810
recognition of mistakes,

13:31.812 --> 13:35.814
and even sometimes
the death of dreams.

13:35.816 --> 13:41.586
Winter is a time of
hibernation or literal death,

13:41.588 --> 13:44.222
but it's a time
that allows us to slow down

13:44.224 --> 13:47.392
and reflect
on what we've been through

13:47.394 --> 13:49.394
and also prepare
for the next season.

13:49.396 --> 13:52.197
What if I don't know
what season I'm in?

13:52.199 --> 13:54.098
Well, that's okay.

13:54.100 --> 13:55.934
That's what we're here
to find out, right?

13:55.936 --> 13:57.969
Yeah.

13:57.971 --> 14:00.972
Can I just hire someone
to do this activity for me?

14:02.242 --> 14:04.042
That's not living
in the moment, Alexa.

14:10.884 --> 14:13.184
I love fall, so I was
automatically drawn

14:13.186 --> 14:14.953
to the oranges and browns,

14:14.955 --> 14:18.189
and then I realized I really am
in a season of change.

14:18.191 --> 14:19.958
I don't know
what's coming next,

14:19.960 --> 14:23.895
but I do know that leaves
are falling off my tree

14:23.897 --> 14:27.232
and new buds
are yet to be visible.

14:30.570 --> 14:31.536
Anyone else?

14:33.039 --> 14:37.308
Well, my tree needs
no explanation.

14:40.247 --> 14:43.982
My life is brimming
with activity and life.

14:43.984 --> 14:47.185
Everything is blooming,
literally.

14:48.088 --> 14:49.087
I'm blooming.

14:52.359 --> 14:54.492
It's true.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.361
So, ladies,
why don't we take this week

14:56.363 --> 15:00.298
and just reflect on our trees
and think about the question,

15:00.300 --> 15:02.567
"What am I doing here?"

15:02.569 --> 15:05.370
Emily, would you mind
to close us in prayer?

15:05.372 --> 15:06.905
Absolutely.

15:06.907 --> 15:09.040
God, grant us the serenity

15:09.042 --> 15:12.143
to accept the things
we cannot change,

15:12.145 --> 15:15.113
the courage to change
the things we can,

15:15.115 --> 15:16.948
and the wisdom
to know the difference.

15:16.950 --> 15:18.516
Thank you, Lord.
Amen.

15:18.518 --> 15:20.618
- Amen.
- Amen.

15:21.221 --> 15:22.420
Hope you all have
a great week.

15:22.422 --> 15:23.955
Jessica, thank you again
for hosting.

15:23.957 --> 15:25.356
You are so welcome.

15:25.358 --> 15:27.358
You guys can just leave
everything on the table.

15:29.462 --> 15:31.195
- Alexa?
- Yeah?

15:31.197 --> 15:33.665
- Can you talk for a second?
- Yeah.

15:33.667 --> 15:37.101
It's such a privilege
to care for your mom.

15:37.103 --> 15:39.971
Not everyone gets to.

15:39.973 --> 15:41.539
It became really exhausting

15:41.541 --> 15:44.008
when I was caring for
my grandmother before she died,

15:44.010 --> 15:48.146
and this is a daycare
that I used.

15:48.148 --> 15:50.415
It's a really great place.

15:50.417 --> 15:53.151
They play lots of games.
My grandmother loved it.

15:53.153 --> 15:56.487
Just when I needed
some time off.

15:57.524 --> 16:00.258
When's the last time
you had an afternoon off?

16:00.260 --> 16:02.327
I don't know.
It's been a while.

16:04.064 --> 16:06.331
Want to know my secret
to fitting it all in?

16:06.333 --> 16:08.433
- What?
- I don't.

16:10.437 --> 16:13.972
Please give yourself permission
to take a day off.

16:13.974 --> 16:16.441
- Will you think about it?
- I'll think about it.

16:16.443 --> 16:19.110
- I love you.
- I love you too.

16:19.112 --> 16:21.079
- Bye.
- Bye.

16:33.693 --> 16:36.995
¶ All my pain ¶

16:38.698 --> 16:42.133
¶ I bring it all ¶

16:42.135 --> 16:46.604
¶ I bring it all to You ¶

16:52.178 --> 16:56.180
¶ All my heartache ¶

16:57.283 --> 17:00.585
¶ I bring it all ¶

17:00.587 --> 17:05.256
¶ I bring it all to You ¶

17:11.196 --> 17:13.330
You know something, Coach?

17:13.333 --> 17:15.165
I practically left school
on a float

17:15.167 --> 17:16.467
when we won the championship.

17:17.503 --> 17:20.771
You always did have
a good head for the game.

17:20.773 --> 17:23.074
More importantly,
you played with heart.

17:23.076 --> 17:25.309
And that's not something
you can teach.

17:26.413 --> 17:28.746
I got to tell you,
it's been a fun time

17:28.748 --> 17:30.748
watching you play on TV,
though.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.750
You made
this old coach proud.

17:33.686 --> 17:36.788
Look at me now.
I'm ruined.

17:36.790 --> 17:40.792
Beau, you're not ruined
unless you give up.

17:40.794 --> 17:43.161
You thought about my offer?

17:44.764 --> 17:48.699
Beau, look out there.
Tell me what you see.

17:54.207 --> 17:55.706
All I can see is the past.

17:55.708 --> 17:58.376
Could be your future.

17:58.378 --> 18:00.778
I didn't even
go to school here.

18:00.780 --> 18:03.247
Our kids
got a lot of potential.

18:03.249 --> 18:05.316
I think we can make winners
of them together.

18:05.318 --> 18:08.753
In fact, I think you and I'd
make a pretty good team.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.722
No disrespect, Coach.

18:11.724 --> 18:13.191
It just seems like
kind of a letdown

18:13.193 --> 18:14.792
after you've played
college ball,

18:14.794 --> 18:17.795
get drafted by the pros.

18:17.797 --> 18:20.098
Yeah, I get that.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.333
It's a pretty big detour.

18:22.335 --> 18:23.634
But I've found throughout life

18:23.636 --> 18:26.304
that sometimes
the little side streets,

18:26.306 --> 18:29.307
those are the ones that give you
the greatest adventures.

18:30.343 --> 18:33.678
Coaching teenagers doesn't
exactly sound like an adventure.

18:33.680 --> 18:36.447
You might be surprised.

18:38.351 --> 18:41.219
'Cause, you see, Beau,
at the end of your life...

18:42.522 --> 18:45.857
...it's not your accomplishments
that matter.

18:45.859 --> 18:48.759
It's the people
you spent time with.

18:48.761 --> 18:51.696
Well, you think about
that offer.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.376
I didn't even have time
to go shopping!

19:05.378 --> 19:07.778
Babe, you have
so many clothes.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.580
Yeah, but it's our
daughter's engagement party.

19:09.582 --> 19:10.781
You buy a new dress.

19:10.783 --> 19:12.483
Well, it was
really short notice.

19:12.485 --> 19:13.784
Yeah, what's up with that?

19:13.786 --> 19:15.686
I feel completely
left out of everything.

19:15.688 --> 19:17.155
Well, I think it's nice
that Paul and Jezi

19:17.157 --> 19:18.556
are putting this on.

19:18.558 --> 19:22.326
But I want to be involved
in planning these things.

19:22.328 --> 19:24.562
Did I wear this
at the last company outing?

19:24.564 --> 19:26.664
Um, I-I don't know.

19:26.666 --> 19:29.734
You're gonna be beautiful
in anything you put on.

19:29.736 --> 19:32.537
I just don't want Jezi
to look better than me!

19:32.539 --> 19:34.438
<i>I'm</i> the mother of the bride!

19:34.440 --> 19:36.307
It is not a competition.

19:36.309 --> 19:38.543
Yes, it is,
and I don't want Jezi to win.

19:38.545 --> 19:41.712
Look, they're gonna be
our in-laws.

19:41.714 --> 19:43.714
Can we let the past go
so we can enjoy this?

19:43.716 --> 19:45.550
Well, I would have liked
to enjoy this

19:45.552 --> 19:50.488
had I been invited to help
with my own daughter's party!

19:50.490 --> 19:51.822
Okay.

19:51.824 --> 19:53.791
I'm gonna go help your mom
get ready

19:53.793 --> 19:55.660
so you can wrap up...

19:56.596 --> 19:58.563
...this -- whatever this is.

20:23.323 --> 20:24.989
Alexa!

20:24.991 --> 20:26.324
Jezi!

20:26.326 --> 20:28.693
Oh, it's so good
to see you again.

20:28.695 --> 20:34.298
Loretta, you look absolutely
stunning this evening.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.801
I'm so sorry.
I heard she went cuckoo.

20:36.803 --> 20:38.369
- Okay.
- Okay.

20:38.371 --> 20:39.870
- Let's go get some punch.
- Yep.

20:39.872 --> 20:43.007
- Where's the cake?!
- Stay. Stay.

20:44.310 --> 20:46.777
Alexa.
Oh!

20:46.779 --> 20:50.381
Wait until you see
how beautiful this is.

20:51.384 --> 20:53.251
You're gonna love it.

21:05.365 --> 21:07.632
Isn't this exciting?

21:07.634 --> 21:10.468
Our kids
are getting married.

21:10.470 --> 21:12.603
Yeah, well,
it was definitely a shock.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.272
Oh, yes.

21:14.274 --> 21:17.341
Nathan went for shock and awe
with his proposal.

21:17.343 --> 21:19.877
I videoed the whole thing.
Did Ravyn show you?

21:19.879 --> 21:21.479
Wait, you were there?

21:21.481 --> 21:23.481
It's okay.
I can send you the video.

21:23.483 --> 21:25.049
Clara!

21:25.051 --> 21:27.351
This is Clara Conover.

21:27.353 --> 21:30.554
This must be the mother
of the bride.

21:30.556 --> 21:33.424
I see Ravyn all over you.

21:33.426 --> 21:35.359
We just adore Ravyn.

21:35.361 --> 21:36.661
Did you notice
that we incorporated

21:36.663 --> 21:38.396
all of her favorite colors
in this evening?

21:38.398 --> 21:41.732
You videoed the engagement?

21:41.734 --> 21:43.801
Well, yes, I mean, you know
that Paul and I moved

21:43.803 --> 21:46.604
to be closer to Nathan,
so we did not miss anything --

21:46.606 --> 21:49.340
I know you moved, Jezi, but I
didn't know that you were --

21:49.342 --> 21:52.810
And guess what. Now we'll be
moving to a lovely house

21:52.812 --> 21:54.378
right near
where he's stationed.

21:54.380 --> 21:55.346
What?

21:55.348 --> 21:57.348
I just love your daughter.

21:57.350 --> 21:59.583
It will be so much fun
to work with her again

21:59.585 --> 22:00.618
to plan the wedding.

22:00.620 --> 22:02.386
We were even thinking

22:02.388 --> 22:04.355
this could be the perfect place
to hold the reception.

22:04.357 --> 22:06.357
- I don't --
- Ravyn told me all about

22:06.359 --> 22:08.326
what you're going through
with your mother.

22:08.328 --> 22:11.462
I cannot even imagine
the stress you must be under.

22:11.464 --> 22:13.864
But you don't have to
worry about anything

22:13.866 --> 22:15.533
because Clara and I,

22:15.535 --> 22:16.967
we're gonna plan
the whole wedding,

22:16.969 --> 22:18.836
and you'll just
get to sit back and enjoy it.

22:18.838 --> 22:21.072
What?
I don't think --

22:21.074 --> 22:22.540
I've been tracking the current

22:22.542 --> 22:23.974
trending colors
and wedding themes.

22:23.976 --> 22:26.344
And we'll want to come up
with the perfect hashtag

22:26.346 --> 22:28.479
that the guests can use
so we can easily curate

22:28.481 --> 22:30.748
all of the photos
from the big day.

22:30.750 --> 22:31.982
- Who is this?
- I'm Clar--

22:31.984 --> 22:33.784
Senator Anderson came!

22:33.786 --> 22:35.086
Come.
I'll introduce you.

22:35.088 --> 22:37.054
Hello, Senator!

22:37.056 --> 22:40.424
Thank you so much
for coming to my party!

22:41.094 --> 22:43.494
- This is Clara Conover.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

22:43.496 --> 22:45.529
She decorated this with me.

22:51.971 --> 22:55.473
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

22:55.475 --> 22:57.475
I think
this goes without saying --

22:57.477 --> 22:59.610
Will you be my best man?

22:59.612 --> 23:01.779
I'd be honored.

23:06.853 --> 23:09.420
Philippians 4:13
has really helped me

23:09.422 --> 23:11.389
get through
some rough times.

23:12.925 --> 23:16.694
When I first enlisted,
this really helped me out.

23:16.696 --> 23:19.597
I think we both need
shields of strength right now.

23:24.971 --> 23:26.437
Thank you.

23:28.975 --> 23:30.841
Good evening, everyone.

23:38.951 --> 23:42.186
I really would like to
thank you all for coming out

23:42.188 --> 23:46.090
to help us celebrate this joyous
engagement party celebration.

23:46.092 --> 23:49.160
My wife, Jezi,
and I are thrilled

23:49.162 --> 23:54.165
to introduce to you our son,
Ensign Nathan Adams,

23:54.167 --> 23:58.002
and his lovely fiancée,
Ravyn Taylor.

24:02.875 --> 24:05.209
John!
John! Hey!

24:05.211 --> 24:08.546
She reminds me
of Cinderella's evil stepmother.

24:08.548 --> 24:10.014
- Who?
- Her.

24:10.016 --> 24:12.750
Oh, my gosh.
Okay, you got to let this go.

24:12.752 --> 24:13.984
No, she is trying
to lure her in.

24:13.986 --> 24:15.786
And the moment
she marries her son,

24:15.788 --> 24:17.822
she is going to force her
to be a servant in her home.

24:17.824 --> 24:20.024
And those two little dots
over there, you see those?

24:20.026 --> 24:22.059
They're gonna become
her little stepsisters.

24:22.061 --> 24:23.527
- All right. I'll give you that.
- Yeah. Okay.

24:23.529 --> 24:24.929
- Yeah, in a fantasy world.
- No.

24:24.931 --> 24:27.031
But in reality, she used to be
your best friend.

24:27.033 --> 24:28.766
- Once upon a time.
- That's clever.

24:28.768 --> 24:30.000
- That was good.
- That's clever.

24:30.002 --> 24:32.770
How are your parents
taking all this?

24:34.040 --> 24:35.906
I should've told them sooner.

24:35.908 --> 24:39.577
- Why did you wait so long?
- There was never a right time.

24:39.579 --> 24:42.079
You know her expectations
are so high.

24:42.081 --> 24:44.815
Hey, it's not you.

24:44.817 --> 24:47.117
It's your mother.

25:05.705 --> 25:07.905
You don't speak Spanish,
'cause I don't speak Spanish!

25:07.907 --> 25:09.106
- Oh, my -- your mom.
- What?

25:09.108 --> 25:10.207
- Your mom.
- Oh, Mother! God! Mom!

25:10.209 --> 25:12.109
- Okay, okay. No.
- Ah...

25:17.183 --> 25:19.583
Oh!
This cake is delicious.

25:19.585 --> 25:21.919
Shh!
We don't want people to see us.

25:21.921 --> 25:23.220
Jezi!

25:23.222 --> 25:25.022
- Shh!
- Where did you get this?

25:25.024 --> 25:28.058
Shh!
Mom, people are gonna tell...

25:28.060 --> 25:30.694
Want some?

25:30.696 --> 25:32.963
I am so sorry, honey.
I just...

25:35.201 --> 25:37.835
You need to fix
this hair of yours.

25:37.837 --> 25:39.904
Okay.
Oh, this is bad.

25:39.906 --> 25:41.238
Mmm!

25:42.675 --> 25:46.076
I want more cake.

25:55.154 --> 25:58.255
Jezi didn't even ask me.
She just told me.

25:58.257 --> 25:59.924
I think you just
misunderstood her.

25:59.926 --> 26:02.626
No, she's taking over
the whole wedding.

26:02.628 --> 26:04.995
- She's really getting worse.
- Yeah. Right?

26:04.997 --> 26:07.097
We have to remember
to put those locks on the doors.

26:07.099 --> 26:08.599
To keep her out?

26:08.601 --> 26:10.668
To keep her <i>in.</i>

26:10.670 --> 26:12.202
What are you talking about?

26:14.774 --> 26:17.808
Did you hear what I just said
about Jezi?

26:17.810 --> 26:19.143
Yes.

26:19.145 --> 26:21.345
She's gonna help,
and you need to accept it.

26:21.347 --> 26:23.614
Help?
No, no.

26:23.616 --> 26:25.182
She is taking over.

26:25.184 --> 26:30.854
Her and her evil little
sidekick, Clara C-- whatever.

26:30.856 --> 26:33.791
- Where are you going?
- Ugh!

27:11.397 --> 27:13.964
Alexa?
What are you doing?

27:13.966 --> 27:15.366
My whole family's sleeping!

27:15.368 --> 27:16.900
Did you move
into my neighborhood?

27:16.902 --> 27:18.235
Yes, I had to rent this house

27:18.237 --> 27:19.903
so I could be close
to plan Ravyn's wedding.

27:19.905 --> 27:22.339
No, you are not planning
this wedding!

27:22.341 --> 27:25.075
This is my daughter.
I am doing this.

27:25.077 --> 27:27.811
I've been dreaming about this
my whole life.

27:27.813 --> 27:30.681
You have two daughters,
and you'll get your chance!

27:30.683 --> 27:33.417
You'll get your chance!
This is my chance.

27:33.419 --> 27:37.254
You're the mother of the groom,
not the bride!

27:37.256 --> 27:38.756
Do you understand me?

27:38.758 --> 27:39.990
You're not taking this
away from me.

27:39.992 --> 27:41.725
Do you hear me?

27:41.727 --> 27:43.661
Yeah, I think the whole
neighborhood just heard you.

27:43.663 --> 27:46.330
Good.
Then it's settled.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.300
Take those off.
It's ridiculous.

27:58.244 --> 28:00.744
Honey, what are you doing?
It's 2:00 in the morning.

28:00.746 --> 28:01.912
I know.

28:01.914 --> 28:03.447
Just give me
a few more minutes

28:03.449 --> 28:05.849
and I'll go to bed.

28:05.851 --> 28:08.018
You have to get up for work
pretty early.

28:08.020 --> 28:10.154
No, I'm working
from home tomorrow.

28:10.156 --> 28:13.691
And I-I want to do both
at the same time.

28:13.693 --> 28:16.093
I like that
wedding-cake design best.

28:20.466 --> 28:27.004
$5,000 for a wedding dress?
Is that what they cost nowadays?

28:27.006 --> 28:29.239
Alexa, we have to talk about
the budget for this wedding.

28:29.241 --> 28:32.309
We are not discussing that
in the middle of the night.

28:34.046 --> 28:36.947
Well, when is a good time
to discuss it?

28:36.949 --> 28:40.250
Okay, honey, I'm coming to bed.

28:40.252 --> 28:42.886
You drew a wedding cake
on your work design.

29:09.081 --> 29:11.281
Aah!
Come on!

29:28.768 --> 29:30.467
I can't believe
it's Beau Taylor.

29:30.469 --> 29:32.136
You're shorter in person.

29:32.138 --> 29:34.304
You put your team
on the map, man.

29:34.306 --> 29:36.006
Coach Z had us watch
all your games as a reference.

29:36.008 --> 29:37.141
All right,
give him some space.

29:37.143 --> 29:39.376
Move back, you guys.

29:39.378 --> 29:41.145
It is an honor to meet you.

29:41.147 --> 29:43.380
I-I've looked up to you
since I was in middle school.

29:43.382 --> 29:44.515
I-I followed
your college career.

29:44.517 --> 29:45.516
I watched all your games.

29:45.518 --> 29:46.950
All right, all right.

29:46.952 --> 29:48.886
Why don't y'all head back
to practice?

29:50.055 --> 29:51.522
Don't get all excited.

29:51.524 --> 29:53.524
I'm just here to see
how things are going.

29:53.526 --> 29:55.859
I just can't believe you guys
are out on the field already.

29:55.861 --> 29:57.194
Oh, yeah.
We get out here early.

29:57.196 --> 30:02.533
97 -- That's Jeremy.
That's our team captain.

30:03.469 --> 30:06.170
I would have ran that play
a little bit better.

30:06.172 --> 30:07.905
Really?

30:07.907 --> 30:10.340
Well, why don't you stick around
and help us out?

30:10.342 --> 30:12.943
I'm just here to watch
right now, Coach.

30:12.945 --> 30:14.945
All right.
Good seeing you.

30:39.338 --> 30:40.604
Oh, hi.

30:40.606 --> 30:43.207
- Morning.
- Good morning.

30:44.944 --> 30:46.844
Isn't it beautiful?

30:46.846 --> 30:48.545
Yeah.
Were you up all night?

30:48.547 --> 30:50.948
Yeah, I have so much to do.
I'm just getting started.

30:50.950 --> 30:53.083
- Mom, this isn't really...
- It's okay.

30:53.085 --> 30:54.585
I can do it all.

30:54.587 --> 30:57.187
And you and your grandmother
are still my priority.

30:58.290 --> 31:00.224
Okay. Well, we'll show it
to Clara later.

31:00.226 --> 31:02.159
Jezi has my wedding book
full of ideas at her house.

31:02.161 --> 31:03.493
We can put it together.

31:03.495 --> 31:06.496
Yeah, I think I know
what's best for you.

31:06.498 --> 31:09.032
Besides, we don't need them,
honey.

31:09.034 --> 31:10.634
You and I
are gonna do this together.

31:10.636 --> 31:13.036
And I'm gonna make you
the most beautiful bride ever.

31:13.038 --> 31:14.571
Promise.

31:14.573 --> 31:17.007
That's really sweet, Mom,
but it's not really my style.

31:17.009 --> 31:18.909
Okay, nonsense.
This is the best style.

31:18.911 --> 31:20.577
I would know.
I'm a professional designer.

31:20.579 --> 31:22.379
I'm stuck!

31:22.381 --> 31:24.348
I'm stuck!

31:30.389 --> 31:32.389
Coach is not gonna let this go.

31:32.391 --> 31:34.524
Can you imagine me,
Beau Taylor,

31:34.526 --> 31:37.127
being the assistant coach
of the Cougars?

31:37.129 --> 31:39.196
Well, let's go talk about it
by Grandpa's tree, okay?

31:39.198 --> 31:41.331
All right. I've been
out on the field all day.

31:41.333 --> 31:43.233
I'll catch up with you.

31:44.169 --> 31:47.037
Okay.
So this is the house.

31:47.039 --> 31:49.172
- Wow, it's beautiful.
- And that's the kitchen.

31:49.174 --> 31:51.008
Just go in there, Clara.

31:53.445 --> 31:56.146
You cannot barge into my house
whenever you want!

31:56.148 --> 31:58.148
Yes, but the thing is, I really
need to get measurements.

31:58.150 --> 32:00.317
Measurements for what?
We just had this convers--

32:00.319 --> 32:02.519
Just pretend I'm not here.

32:06.625 --> 32:08.292
I knew I should have installed
those locks.

32:08.294 --> 32:10.093
Are those your ideas
for the wedding?

32:10.095 --> 32:12.362
Jezi, what did we just talk
about, literally last night?

32:12.364 --> 32:14.097
- You want to plan the wedding.
- Yes.

32:14.099 --> 32:17.467
But we just have some ideas
to add to your ideas.

32:17.469 --> 32:19.303
- No.
- Like...

32:20.005 --> 32:21.538
...this tiara!

32:21.540 --> 32:24.274
What do you think about it
for the bridesmaids?

32:24.276 --> 32:27.044
They're awful.
I got you one too!

32:27.046 --> 32:28.245
I -- mm...

32:30.115 --> 32:31.682
Ohh.

32:33.352 --> 32:36.586
That makes you look
so youthful.

32:36.588 --> 32:39.589
Jezi...

32:47.499 --> 32:50.634
Do you remember when we planted
this tree for Grandpa?

32:52.504 --> 32:55.038
It's always so peaceful
out here.

32:57.509 --> 33:01.745
Maybe it was a mistake,
bringing the wedding home.

33:01.747 --> 33:04.147
I forgot how controlling
she can be.

33:04.149 --> 33:07.417
It's bad enough having to live
at home with the 'rents.

33:07.419 --> 33:10.253
It's just such a small town.

33:10.255 --> 33:13.590
Could I even be happy here
being assistant coach?

33:13.592 --> 33:17.127
I mean, it's my big day, and I
don't have a say in it at all.

33:17.129 --> 33:20.030
It's my life. I didn't even get
a say in what happened to me.

33:20.032 --> 33:21.732
She hasn't even asked me
what I want.

33:21.734 --> 33:23.600
I don't even know
what I want anymore.

33:23.602 --> 33:25.135
I know what I want.

33:25.137 --> 33:26.670
I just don't think
she'll let me have it.

33:26.672 --> 33:28.271
I had what I wanted.

33:28.273 --> 33:30.707
Exactly.
We should get what we want.

33:30.709 --> 33:33.176
You're talking about
some silly wedding.

33:33.178 --> 33:35.045
I'm talking about
the rest of my life.

33:35.047 --> 33:38.782
Beau, my wedding's not silly.
It's important to me.

33:38.784 --> 33:40.150
I'm sorry.

33:42.054 --> 33:44.454
I just thought you were coming
out here to listen to me.

33:44.456 --> 33:47.157
That's because everything's
always about you.

33:47.159 --> 33:49.726
Why don't you go do something
for someone else

33:49.728 --> 33:52.696
and teach those kids
some football?

33:54.199 --> 33:55.499
I better go back inside
and make sure

33:55.501 --> 33:57.667
they haven't
changed anything else.

33:59.238 --> 34:00.404
Stop pulling my hair!

34:03.809 --> 34:05.042
You guys!

34:05.044 --> 34:07.477
Enough!

34:07.479 --> 34:10.179
Stop fighting over <i>my</i> day.

34:10.181 --> 34:11.313
We don't need your help.

34:11.315 --> 34:12.516
Mom.

34:12.518 --> 34:15.518
- My mom!
- Oh, the tiara!

34:15.521 --> 34:16.753
- Aah!
- Aah!

34:20.525 --> 34:22.592
Okay.

34:22.594 --> 34:25.295
Mom, you really need
to stop running away.

34:25.297 --> 34:27.664
Running away?

34:27.666 --> 34:31.501
Walt called me.
He needs his lunch.

34:31.503 --> 34:36.072
Mom, he's gone.
He's been dead for a while now.

34:36.074 --> 34:38.241
- Oh.
- Let's go.

34:38.243 --> 34:40.444
Are we going to a party?

34:41.847 --> 34:44.815
Well, I don't think you should
wear your hair like that.

34:44.817 --> 34:46.783
You must be starving.

34:48.853 --> 34:51.221
Put a comb through it, maybe.

34:51.223 --> 34:53.790
I'll make you your favorite.

34:53.792 --> 34:56.460
How would you know
what my favorite is?

34:56.462 --> 35:00.197
Let's take a look
at our households.

35:00.199 --> 35:02.766
Imagine your life
like a kingdom.

35:02.768 --> 35:05.402
What is the present condition
of your castle?

35:05.404 --> 35:07.270
Who lives in your castle?

35:07.272 --> 35:08.405
Is there any conflict?

35:08.407 --> 35:10.807
Who lives in the castle tower?

35:10.809 --> 35:13.376
Is anyone trapped up there?

35:13.378 --> 35:15.512
Is your drawbridge up
or is it down?

35:15.514 --> 35:16.880
This was daunting.

35:16.882 --> 35:18.682
Oh, come on.
Are you kidding me?

35:18.684 --> 35:21.284
I could do your castle with
my eyes closed.

35:21.286 --> 35:22.786
Am I that open of a book?

35:22.788 --> 35:25.822
My castle is cramped.

35:25.824 --> 35:28.291
I'm closing the drawbridge.

35:28.293 --> 35:30.660
I think I need to open
my drawbridge.

35:30.662 --> 35:32.863
I never let my kids have
their friends over anymore.

35:32.865 --> 35:34.698
Hmm.

35:34.700 --> 35:36.700
Literally closing the kingdom.

35:38.670 --> 35:41.338
There's -- See that?
T-That's a dragon.

35:41.340 --> 35:43.807
- Did you name it Jezi?
- That's Jezi.

35:43.809 --> 35:46.176
Ohh!

35:46.178 --> 35:47.444
Yeah.

35:47.446 --> 35:49.346
Well, I just don't want
my kids' friends

35:49.348 --> 35:51.248
to tell their parents
how messy my house is.

35:51.250 --> 35:53.350
- Aw.
- It's bad.

35:53.352 --> 35:58.188
Well, my husband wants to move
our castle to Florida.

35:58.190 --> 35:59.789
- What?
- Oh, my gosh.

35:59.791 --> 36:01.658
Yes, and we're battling

36:01.660 --> 36:04.227
'cause there's no way
I'm gonna take our kids

36:04.229 --> 36:06.429
away from their school
or their friends.

36:06.431 --> 36:07.831
- Mm.
- Aw.

36:07.833 --> 36:11.401
I'm so sorry, Emily.
That's really hard.

36:11.403 --> 36:15.939
Well, I think my castle is quite
the opposite of most of yours.

36:15.941 --> 36:18.441
We took my daughter
to college last weekend,

36:18.443 --> 36:23.413
and my castle is feeling empty
and sad and lonely

36:23.415 --> 36:24.714
and way too quiet.

36:24.716 --> 36:26.683
Enjoy the quiet days.

36:26.685 --> 36:28.885
Well, you guys are welcome
to come and babysit

36:28.887 --> 36:30.787
at my crazy castle anytime.

36:30.789 --> 36:32.455
- Ohh...
- It's okay.

36:32.457 --> 36:34.658
- No, no, no, I'm good.
- No, seriously, anytime.

36:34.660 --> 36:36.526
- Kingdom. Anytime.
- It is cleaner than mine, so...

36:45.537 --> 36:47.237
Ravyn, what about this one?

36:47.239 --> 36:51.341
This one would look
gorgeous on your figure.

36:51.343 --> 36:54.544
No. I want something
simple and vintage.

36:54.546 --> 36:55.745
- Vintage?
- Simple?

36:55.747 --> 36:58.381
I want to be different.

36:58.383 --> 37:00.550
There's nothing wrong
with being different.

37:00.552 --> 37:01.685
Thank you, Grandma.

37:01.687 --> 37:03.587
I think this one
fits your vision.

37:03.589 --> 37:07.457
Yeah, but that dress
is gonna accentuate your hips.

37:07.459 --> 37:11.461
Do you know what would
look gorgeous on your figure?

37:11.463 --> 37:12.495
This dress.

37:12.497 --> 37:15.632
No, Jezi, this one.

37:15.634 --> 37:18.768
What about this blue one?

37:18.770 --> 37:21.238
No, Ravyn,
blue is not your color.

37:21.240 --> 37:23.807
I think I have a suggestion.
Ravyn, come with me.

37:23.809 --> 37:25.742
Okay.

37:34.620 --> 37:36.620
No.
No, no, no, no, no.

37:36.622 --> 37:38.421
These are all Callie Teins.

37:38.423 --> 37:41.424
They're one-of-a-kind.

37:41.426 --> 37:43.860
Let's just not touch
any of them, okay?

37:43.862 --> 37:46.029
Okay.

37:59.978 --> 38:03.446
- Isn't she gorgeous?
- She is.

38:05.050 --> 38:06.883
Oh.

38:06.885 --> 38:10.420
I have been waiting
my whole life for this moment.

38:10.422 --> 38:14.424
I mean, it's beautiful,
but it's kind of big,

38:14.426 --> 38:15.859
and it's not really
what I wanted.

38:15.861 --> 38:18.328
No, but you look gorgeous,
honey.

38:18.330 --> 38:19.963
You look like a princess.

38:19.965 --> 38:22.966
Yeah, you look like
<i>my</i> princess.

38:22.968 --> 38:24.534
<i>Our</i> princess.

38:24.536 --> 38:26.569
No, <i>my</i> princess.

38:26.571 --> 38:28.371
Where's your mother?

38:30.609 --> 38:33.643
You look perfect
in this dress.

38:37.049 --> 38:38.081
Oh, my gosh.

38:38.083 --> 38:39.849
Mom, stop.

38:39.851 --> 38:42.919
I'm stuck!
I'm stuck!

38:42.921 --> 38:44.788
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, Mom.
Stop.

38:44.790 --> 38:45.922
Oh, it's ripping.

38:45.924 --> 38:48.091
It's ripping.
It's ripping!

38:54.066 --> 38:55.765
I want to keep shopping.

38:55.767 --> 38:57.634
No, Mom, you're done shopping
for today.

38:57.636 --> 39:01.438
Alexa, don't worry.
I'll pay for Ravyn's dress.

39:01.440 --> 39:02.872
Mom, let's go.

39:02.874 --> 39:05.842
Oh. Hi, honey!
How are you?

39:05.844 --> 39:07.711
<i>Hey, Mom.</i>
<i>Are you with Ravyn?</i>

39:07.713 --> 39:09.112
Yes.

39:09.114 --> 39:11.581
Jezi, give me my phone.

39:11.583 --> 39:13.516
Hi, baby.
I miss you.

39:13.518 --> 39:15.418
When are they letting you
come here?

39:15.420 --> 39:18.521
<i>Well, love, that's actually</i>
<i>what I called to tell you.</i>

39:18.523 --> 39:19.956
<i>I think you better sit down.</i>

39:19.958 --> 39:23.126
Oh, actually,
I literally can't.

39:36.775 --> 39:37.941
Jeremy!

39:51.089 --> 39:53.156
What, Coach,
a play-action fake?

39:53.158 --> 39:54.858
That's so old-school.

39:54.860 --> 39:57.127
You guys got to line 'em up
better than that.

39:57.129 --> 39:58.895
Everybody saw that coming.

39:58.897 --> 40:03.066
Hey, armchair quarterback.
Either shut it or get over here.

40:03.068 --> 40:05.702
Well, somebody's got to
coach this team.

40:12.778 --> 40:14.544
What's up, Coach?

40:21.119 --> 40:22.852
Jeremy!

40:39.538 --> 40:41.771
You're gonna come this way. You
got to kick this guy this way.

40:41.773 --> 40:43.840
You've got to hug this
right side, all right?

40:43.842 --> 40:45.642
You got this?
You can do this.

40:45.644 --> 40:48.011
You can do this. All right?
"Cougars" on three.

40:48.013 --> 40:49.112
One, two, three!

40:49.114 --> 40:51.548
- Cougars!
- Cougars!

40:51.550 --> 40:53.082
Be aggressive!

40:53.084 --> 40:55.018
B-E aggressive!

40:55.020 --> 40:57.687
B-E A-G-G-R-E-S-S-I-V-E!

40:57.689 --> 40:58.822
Be aggressive!

40:58.824 --> 41:01.057
B-E aggressive!

41:02.861 --> 41:05.595
He's clear, he's clear.
He's got it.

41:05.597 --> 41:08.498
He's got it. He's got it.
Yes!

41:14.873 --> 41:16.139
Yes!

41:16.141 --> 41:18.475
Wow, it feels good
to win again!

41:18.477 --> 41:20.610
- Thank you, Beau.
- Ah, the kids did it.

41:20.612 --> 41:23.613
Well, it was
under your guidance, buddy.

41:23.615 --> 41:25.148
Well, <i>we</i> did it.

41:25.150 --> 41:27.217
It's good to have you
back on the team, kid.

41:27.219 --> 41:29.586
I tell you what, Coach.

41:29.588 --> 41:31.054
It's good to be back
on a team.

41:31.056 --> 41:33.256
Yeah. Yeah!

41:39.965 --> 41:42.232
We got you good, man!

41:43.835 --> 41:46.769
Hey.
What's wrong?

41:49.040 --> 41:51.574
Is this her dress?

41:51.576 --> 41:54.978
You guys got her dress?
Babe! This is huge.

41:54.980 --> 41:56.880
Everything I've read in those
magazines that you gave me

41:56.882 --> 41:59.082
that you didn't think I was
reading, but I-I did read them,

41:59.084 --> 42:01.651
said that this is the biggest
part of every wedding,

42:01.653 --> 42:03.152
and you guys nailed it.

42:03.154 --> 42:05.588
I bet this is so exciting
for the two of you.

42:05.590 --> 42:08.124
Or upsetting.
Are you -- Are you upset?

42:09.227 --> 42:11.194
Is this 'cause
our baby's getting married?

42:11.196 --> 42:13.563
I know, I know.
I feel the same way, too, right?

42:13.565 --> 42:15.932
That's what this is.
But this is a new step.

42:15.934 --> 42:18.768
This is another step in
a new direction in our lives.

42:18.770 --> 42:22.739
And, oh, man, I just --
I bet this is beautiful.

42:22.741 --> 42:25.275
This isn't Ravyn's dress.

42:27.045 --> 42:29.178
Is -- Is this your dress?

42:30.215 --> 42:32.882
Things aren't going
the way I planned.

42:32.884 --> 42:35.184
Well, whose --
whose dress is it?

42:40.225 --> 42:43.626
Oh, boy, I don't like
this piece of paper.

42:43.628 --> 42:45.662
I don't like this piece of paper
at all, to be honest.

42:45.664 --> 42:47.931
It's mistyped.
They wrote this wrong.

42:47.933 --> 42:49.933
- This is mistyped.
- Mom!

42:49.935 --> 42:51.100
We got to talk to them
about this.

42:51.102 --> 42:52.669
- Dad!
- This is...

42:52.671 --> 42:54.270
You guys are looking at

42:54.272 --> 42:58.174
the new assistant coach
of the Cougars!

42:58.176 --> 43:01.110
Rrow!

43:01.112 --> 43:02.679
Don't worry.

43:02.681 --> 43:04.180
Like, this is a good thing.
I needed this.

43:04.182 --> 43:06.282
I-I have purpose again.

43:06.284 --> 43:08.785
Nathan's
being deployed.

43:08.787 --> 43:11.154
We have six weeks
to get married.

43:19.297 --> 43:21.364
Oh!

43:21.366 --> 43:24.767
We're at Walt's offices.
Yeah.

43:24.769 --> 43:27.070
Mom...

43:27.072 --> 43:30.006
This is gonna be
so much fun.

43:30.008 --> 43:32.942
This place comes
highly recommended.

43:32.944 --> 43:34.644
And they play games.

43:34.646 --> 43:35.979
I think this morning,
it's bingo.

43:35.981 --> 43:38.748
- You love bingo!
- I do?

43:38.750 --> 43:40.016
Yes.

43:40.018 --> 43:41.751
Oh.

43:42.821 --> 43:44.954
I'll be back at 4:00 p.m.
sharp to pick you up.

43:44.956 --> 43:48.224
- Okay, Mom?
- No. I want to stay with you.

43:48.226 --> 43:49.826
It's going to be fun, Mom.

43:49.828 --> 43:51.961
I promise I won't make a fuss.
I'll be good.

43:51.963 --> 43:53.830
- Why can't I just stay with you?
- Hey, y'all. Come on in.

43:53.832 --> 43:55.865
Welcome to Seasons.

43:55.867 --> 43:57.367
You know what?
This is your lucky day.

43:57.369 --> 43:59.235
It's Bingo Monday!

43:59.237 --> 44:01.270
You must be Loretta Gomez.

44:01.272 --> 44:03.973
Hi. I'm Geraldine.
I'm so happy you're here!

44:03.975 --> 44:05.908
Don't leave me.

44:05.910 --> 44:08.911
I won't be difficult anymore.

44:08.913 --> 44:10.813
I promise.

44:10.815 --> 44:12.882
Please.

44:12.884 --> 44:15.184
Alexa.

44:15.186 --> 44:18.154
Okay, you're gonna have
so much fun.

44:18.156 --> 44:20.289
It'll be so much fun,
you won't want to leave.

44:20.291 --> 44:25.228
Nobody can take care of me
like you.

44:26.798 --> 44:29.098
Here we go.
Have a great day.

44:32.771 --> 44:34.704
Alexa.

44:35.840 --> 44:38.041
Alexa.

44:38.043 --> 44:40.343
I promise
I'm gonna be back, Mom.

44:59.297 --> 45:01.097
You just landed
the DuBose account.

45:01.099 --> 45:03.232
This will be a fast turnaround.

45:18.249 --> 45:20.183
Hey, Beau.
I'm at work.

45:20.185 --> 45:21.784
I can't be on the phone.
Is everything okay?

45:21.786 --> 45:23.352
Yeah, Mom, I'm fine.

45:23.354 --> 45:25.822
My first official game as
Coach T is Tuesday at 6:00 p.m.

45:25.824 --> 45:28.191
It's really important to me.
Put it on your calendar.

45:28.193 --> 45:30.093
Yes, of course.
I'll be there.

45:31.763 --> 45:34.397
B-7.

45:34.399 --> 45:37.500
B-7.

45:37.502 --> 45:41.370
I remember being seven!

45:41.372 --> 45:42.972
Don't you?

45:45.877 --> 45:48.077
N-41.

45:49.047 --> 45:50.980
N-41.

45:50.982 --> 45:52.515
Call my husband!

45:52.517 --> 45:55.318
It's clear
I'm in the wrong building.

45:56.254 --> 45:59.322
All righty.
I sure will do that.

45:59.324 --> 46:02.492
Just a minute. Let's see
if we can't get you a bingo.

46:03.428 --> 46:06.896
O-71.

46:06.898 --> 46:09.165
Oh, I see some--
Did you get it?

46:09.167 --> 46:11.934
Wha-- O-71.

46:11.936 --> 46:13.436
Are we having fun yet?!

46:13.438 --> 46:14.837
Whoo!

46:16.341 --> 46:18.007
N-36.

46:29.788 --> 46:31.454
- Alexa Taylor?
- Yes?

46:31.456 --> 46:32.822
Honey, your mother ran away.

46:32.824 --> 46:34.090
What?!

46:34.092 --> 46:36.859
Do you know where
she might have gone?

46:36.861 --> 46:38.895
I'm on my way.

46:38.897 --> 46:40.463
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

46:40.465 --> 46:42.465
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

46:47.906 --> 46:50.973
Come on, everyone.
Think-tank time.

47:02.987 --> 47:05.054
Mom!
Mom!

47:05.924 --> 47:09.025
I'm here. You're okay.
You're okay.

47:30.215 --> 47:38.020
That was... the worst experience
of my life.

47:38.456 --> 47:41.090
You're being a bit dramatic,
don't you think?

47:42.961 --> 47:45.962
How could you leave me
in a place like that?

47:45.964 --> 47:47.997
It was a one-time thing.

47:47.999 --> 47:49.632
I'm really busy.

47:49.634 --> 47:51.534
I can't just leave you home
alone.

47:51.536 --> 47:53.936
That's ridiculous.

47:53.938 --> 47:56.038
I'm a grown woman!

47:57.108 --> 47:59.909
Leave me home alone.

47:59.911 --> 48:02.111
Nonsense.

48:02.113 --> 48:04.480
What are you so busy doing,
Alexa?

48:04.482 --> 48:06.916
I never had any problem
getting everything done

48:06.918 --> 48:08.417
when I was your age.

48:08.419 --> 48:12.989
What you need
is better management skills.

48:13.558 --> 48:15.892
I'm doing the best I can.

48:17.896 --> 48:19.629
Of course you are, dear.

48:19.631 --> 48:21.931
I'm sorry, Mom.

48:22.433 --> 48:24.267
What are you sorry about?

48:24.269 --> 48:26.235
I'm just...

48:26.905 --> 48:28.471
I'm just tired.

48:29.173 --> 48:31.607
I have so much going on.
I have Beau.

48:31.609 --> 48:33.643
I have Ravyn --
She's getting married.

48:33.645 --> 48:37.213
I have work. I just...

48:37.215 --> 48:39.081
- It's a lot.
- Who are you?

48:39.083 --> 48:40.983
Who are you?

48:42.086 --> 48:44.620
Let me out of this car.

48:44.622 --> 48:47.390
We're going home.

48:51.429 --> 48:53.195
I need help.

48:53.564 --> 48:55.398
John was right.
I can't do it.

48:55.400 --> 48:58.000
Aw.
Nobody can.

48:58.002 --> 49:00.503
Wonder Woman is just a character
in a movie.

49:00.505 --> 49:02.371
I know, but I didn't
want to miss anything,

49:02.373 --> 49:04.507
and now I feel like I'm missing
everything.

49:04.509 --> 49:06.475
- Classic case of FOMO.
- FOMO.

49:06.477 --> 49:08.711
- Mm-hmm.
- What is FOMO?

49:08.713 --> 49:10.713
- The Fear of Missing Out.
- Exactly.

49:10.715 --> 49:13.182
That's exactly
how I've been feeling.

49:13.184 --> 49:15.217
I just didn't know
how to put it into words.

49:15.219 --> 49:17.219
Wow. You learn something new
every day.

49:17.221 --> 49:19.121
I feel like that all the time.

49:19.123 --> 49:21.958
Well, how can we not with this
thing in our hands, right?

49:21.960 --> 49:23.492
I mean, we can't be
constantly connected

49:23.494 --> 49:25.094
<i>and</i> disconnected
at the same time.

49:25.096 --> 49:26.696
It's impossible.

49:26.698 --> 49:29.165
The worst thing about FOMO
is that if we're experiencing

49:29.167 --> 49:31.100
the fear of missing out
on something else,

49:31.102 --> 49:32.969
that means that we aren't
trusting that God has us

49:32.971 --> 49:34.637
exactly where
we're supposed to be.

49:34.639 --> 49:36.706
Mm.
That's so true.

49:36.708 --> 49:38.107
Okay.

49:38.109 --> 49:42.078
My name is Alexa Taylor,
and I need help.

49:42.080 --> 49:43.646
- Hi, Alexa!
- Hi, Alexa!

49:43.648 --> 49:45.748
That felt good.

49:45.750 --> 49:49.385
I feel like a ton of bricks
just fell off my shoulders.

49:49.387 --> 49:51.654
- Lay it on us.
- What do you need?

49:51.656 --> 49:53.990
- Mm-hmm.
- You guys are busy, too.

49:53.992 --> 49:55.224
You were the first one
on my doorstep

49:55.226 --> 49:56.492
when my kid broke his leg.

49:56.494 --> 49:58.361
- Yeah, but that was different.
- How?

49:58.363 --> 50:00.262
This is what we do
for each other.

50:02.000 --> 50:03.265
Okay.

50:05.236 --> 50:08.304
Now I have five weeks
to plan my daughter's wedding.

50:08.306 --> 50:10.339
My mom got kicked out
of daycare.

50:10.341 --> 50:12.041
So sorry.

50:12.043 --> 50:17.613
And I spent $5,500 out
of my daughter's wedding budget.

50:17.615 --> 50:20.616
And I thought my days of going
to high school football games

50:20.618 --> 50:22.518
was over,
and I have to do that again.

50:22.520 --> 50:26.489
And I can't keep watching Jezi
just swoop in and save the day.

50:27.225 --> 50:30.259
I love your mom.
She cracks me up.

50:30.261 --> 50:31.527
I'll take Fridays.

50:31.529 --> 50:34.096
That would be great.
Thank you.

50:34.098 --> 50:36.365
I also need help on Wednesday

50:36.367 --> 50:39.368
so that I can go register
for gifts with Ravyn.

50:39.370 --> 50:41.103
- I got you.
- Thank you.

50:41.105 --> 50:42.171
Good.

50:42.173 --> 50:43.606
Know what?
I can do that.

50:43.608 --> 50:46.308
- Yay!
- Count me in.

50:47.345 --> 50:48.544
Thank you, girls.

50:48.546 --> 50:50.579
Yay.

50:50.581 --> 50:53.649
Well, today, we get to look
at our life paths,

50:53.651 --> 50:57.486
and we get to answer the
question, "What am I known for?"

50:57.488 --> 51:01.157
The Bible says that King Ahab
did far more evil

51:01.159 --> 51:03.392
in the eyes of the Lord
than his father.

51:03.394 --> 51:06.328
So we have the chance to do
better or worse

51:06.330 --> 51:08.097
than our parents did.

51:08.099 --> 51:11.767
Great. So now I have to admit
I'm just like my father.

51:11.769 --> 51:13.636
Oh.
Is that a bad thing?

51:13.638 --> 51:16.439
Well, I mean, there's a reason
why none of you have met him.

51:16.441 --> 51:20.409
Well, we get to look at our past
in order to change our future.

51:20.411 --> 51:22.378
So turn to page 29.

51:23.648 --> 51:26.816
We're gonna use the stones
as memory markers.

51:26.818 --> 51:29.585
So think of significant events
in your life

51:29.587 --> 51:31.654
and place them on the stones.

51:31.656 --> 51:35.558
It could be a childhood move,
the death of a parent,

51:35.560 --> 51:39.395
job success,
or... the birth of a child.

51:39.397 --> 51:40.329
Oh.

51:42.333 --> 51:44.567
Then we're gonna place
a bird sticker

51:44.569 --> 51:47.436
on anywhere in our path
where we thrived.

51:47.438 --> 51:51.207
We'll then place a tree sticker
in places of growth,

51:51.209 --> 51:52.641
and then we'll use the stars

51:52.643 --> 51:56.645
to mark places
that might still be unresolved.

52:00.551 --> 52:02.451
Yeah.

52:06.290 --> 52:07.723
Beau's injury.

52:07.725 --> 52:09.258
Yeah.

52:09.260 --> 52:13.362
It's a big stone
I haven't had time to deal with.

52:13.364 --> 52:16.799
And my dad's death is a glaring
stone that I can't get over

52:16.801 --> 52:19.201
because my mom
is constantly talking about him

52:19.203 --> 52:21.470
like he's still alive.

52:22.874 --> 52:28.177
And Ravyn not telling me
about Nathan --

52:28.179 --> 52:30.412
That stings the most.

52:30.815 --> 52:33.616
I really don't want to deal
with the stone

52:33.618 --> 52:35.451
of being like my father.

52:35.453 --> 52:36.552
Mm.

52:36.554 --> 52:38.187
And wouldn't it be nice

52:38.189 --> 52:41.223
if we didn't have to
carry that around anymore?

52:41.726 --> 52:43.325
All right.
Everybody listen up.

52:43.327 --> 52:46.462
You want to show them that play
we talked about?

52:46.464 --> 52:48.797
All right.
So this is what we're gonna do.

52:48.799 --> 52:52.301
Robbie, you're gonna throw
to Kevin here.

52:52.303 --> 52:56.605
Tyler, you're gonna run route,
hook right, left, then right --

52:56.607 --> 53:00.409
Hey, we've never run
that play before.

53:00.411 --> 53:02.511
This is what I was thinking.

53:02.513 --> 53:05.347
Do you want to win
the championship?

53:05.349 --> 53:06.849
No disrespect, Beau Taylor,

53:06.851 --> 53:08.651
but I know my team
better than you.

53:08.653 --> 53:10.686
And I know football
a lot better than you.

53:10.688 --> 53:12.254
Look, I'm just trying to --

53:12.256 --> 53:15.224
Hey, who here has played
professional football?

53:16.928 --> 53:19.728
I'm the captain of this team.

53:19.730 --> 53:23.199
And I'm the coach of this team.

53:23.768 --> 53:27.636
All right, all right.
Let's settle down.

53:28.472 --> 53:31.340
Jeremy, we're gonna run
Beau's play.

53:31.342 --> 53:32.808
It's his call.

53:33.644 --> 53:36.278
The rest of you,
let's all hit the weight room.

53:49.594 --> 53:51.927
Can you believe
that he's questioning me?

53:53.264 --> 53:57.266
Beau, leadership is more
than just dictating.

53:57.268 --> 53:59.702
We're the coaches.
We know what's best.

53:59.704 --> 54:02.771
I didn't dictate to you boys
when you won your championship.

54:02.773 --> 54:04.473
I listened to your ideas.

54:04.475 --> 54:07.643
Yeah. And I was right then,
and I'm right now.

54:07.645 --> 54:09.979
We're teaching these kids
to be leaders.

54:09.981 --> 54:11.880
That's our real purpose here.

54:11.882 --> 54:13.782
It's not about being right.

54:13.784 --> 54:16.785
It's about winning, Coach,
and I know how to win.

54:16.787 --> 54:18.787
Yes.
Yes, you do.

54:19.724 --> 54:22.491
What do you win
when you lose these kids' trust?

54:22.493 --> 54:24.426
I've already lost everything.

54:24.428 --> 54:26.562
I don't care
about those kids' trust.

54:26.564 --> 54:29.732
Well, to be a good leader,
you're gonna need their trust.

54:29.734 --> 54:30.966
Jeremy was right.

54:30.968 --> 54:32.568
You need to coach
to their strengths.

54:32.570 --> 54:34.737
Yeah. Trust me.
They need new plays.

54:34.739 --> 54:39.475
No. You need more experience
as a coach.

54:39.877 --> 54:41.877
What am I even doing here?

54:44.015 --> 54:45.881
This is high school football.

54:45.883 --> 54:47.883
Who cares?

54:47.885 --> 54:49.785
You know what matters?

54:49.787 --> 54:52.855
Millions of people watching you.

54:53.391 --> 54:55.557
I don't care
about these peewee players

54:55.559 --> 54:59.395
or this small town
in the middle of nowhere.

54:59.397 --> 55:02.064
I made something of myself.

55:05.469 --> 55:09.471
And I didn't want to be
small-time like you, Coach.

55:11.842 --> 55:13.509
Beau...

55:14.578 --> 55:17.613
...you keep living in the past,

55:17.615 --> 55:19.848
you're never gonna have
a future.

55:22.453 --> 55:26.822
Why don't you just stop
being nice to me and let me go?

55:28.893 --> 55:32.561
Well... wherever you go,

55:32.563 --> 55:35.364
I sure hope you find
what you're looking for.

55:35.366 --> 55:36.899
I'll see you.

55:44.108 --> 55:45.407
Come on.

56:48.773 --> 56:51.673
"Rachel has experienced
the favor of her husband.

56:51.675 --> 56:54.176
She and Joseph are given
extra honor and protection

56:54.178 --> 56:57.880
and shown favor by traveling
last in the household caravan.

56:57.882 --> 57:00.048
They are provided extra time
of escape

57:00.050 --> 57:01.650
in the event of an attack.

57:01.652 --> 57:03.152
This also puts Rachel..."

57:10.461 --> 57:12.060
It takes two hands. I got this.

57:13.464 --> 57:14.563
Perfect.

57:14.565 --> 57:16.432
All right.
And twist.

57:16.434 --> 57:18.066
We need twisties.

57:19.103 --> 57:20.669
Are you eating the party favors?

57:20.671 --> 57:23.138
No. Unh-unh.
Are you?

57:23.140 --> 57:25.707
- Don't eat the party favors!
- I would not do that.

57:25.709 --> 57:27.042
Wait! Aah!

57:35.920 --> 57:37.219
Did you do this?

57:37.221 --> 57:38.787
No.

57:38.789 --> 57:40.656
I think Jael did.

57:40.658 --> 57:42.057
Really?

57:44.061 --> 57:47.095
I think this means we have
the night to ourselves.

57:47.097 --> 57:49.164
You need to take
your medication.

57:49.166 --> 57:52.000
No!
Get that out of my face.

57:52.002 --> 57:54.069
The sooner you take
your medication,

57:54.071 --> 57:56.505
the sooner I can go make you
breakfast.

57:57.875 --> 58:00.008
Hey, Mom, time to go.

58:00.978 --> 58:03.011
Oh, my God.

58:04.148 --> 58:05.814
Mother.

58:10.521 --> 58:12.588
Mom!

58:15.259 --> 58:18.894
Mom!
Why aren't you dressed?

58:19.763 --> 58:22.998
I don't have anything scheduled
for Tuesday.

58:23.000 --> 58:24.600
Well, it's Monday.

58:24.602 --> 58:26.168
We have an appointment
to register for gifts

58:26.170 --> 58:27.903
and sample food
at the catering company.

58:27.905 --> 58:31.106
I thought that was on Wednesday.

58:31.108 --> 58:33.175
I don't have anyone scheduled
for Mom today.

58:33.177 --> 58:35.911
Alexa, it's fine.

58:35.913 --> 58:38.547
These things happen
all the time.

58:38.549 --> 58:40.148
I'll take care of Ravyn.

58:40.150 --> 58:42.751
No!
I...

58:42.753 --> 58:45.053
Just give me a few seconds.
I'll be right back.

58:45.055 --> 58:47.289
Don't go anywhere.

58:47.291 --> 58:49.258
Okay, but hurry.

58:53.564 --> 58:55.664
All right! Everybody listen up!

58:55.666 --> 58:57.232
This is why you show up
in August.

58:57.234 --> 58:58.834
This is why you practice.

58:58.836 --> 59:01.937
This is why you sweat.
This is why you hurt.

59:01.939 --> 59:03.705
Today is your day.

59:03.707 --> 59:05.974
Leave everything out there,
all right?

59:05.976 --> 59:08.844
I want nothing on the sidelines.
Leave everything out there.

59:08.846 --> 59:10.646
All right. You ready?
Let's go get 'em!

59:10.648 --> 59:12.047
Come on!
Come on!

59:12.049 --> 59:14.616
Jeremy, Jeremy! Hold the line!
Give it your all!

59:14.618 --> 59:16.084
Go! Go!

59:16.086 --> 59:17.653
Yeah!

59:19.056 --> 59:20.322
All right, Coach.

59:28.265 --> 59:29.998
Hi. Are you the Taylor party?

59:30.000 --> 59:31.199
- Yes, we are.
- Yes.

59:31.201 --> 59:33.902
- We are.
- Right this way.

59:33.904 --> 59:38.674
Mom, do not touch the cakes.

59:38.976 --> 59:40.943
This table is a taste of Italy.

59:40.945 --> 59:44.279
Here is Asian Infusion,
and here is our Mexican Fiesta.

59:44.281 --> 59:45.814
You're free to taste everything.

59:45.816 --> 59:47.015
Oh, no, no.

59:47.017 --> 59:48.784
I'm -- I'm sorry,

59:48.786 --> 59:51.820
but Mexican Fiesta doesn't
really go with this wedding.

59:51.822 --> 59:53.121
Where's your French cuisine?

59:53.123 --> 59:54.990
I don't have French cuisine.
I'm sorry.

59:54.992 --> 59:56.625
But we could whip something up
for you.

59:56.627 --> 59:59.828
Actually, I think
the Mexican cuisine is perfect

59:59.830 --> 01:00:00.862
for a backyard wedding.

01:00:00.864 --> 01:00:02.664
- Don't you think?
- Mm.

01:00:03.267 --> 01:00:05.233
- Really, Alexa?
- Really.

01:00:05.235 --> 01:00:07.135
Then why don't we just throw
some hot dogs

01:00:07.137 --> 01:00:09.605
and a burger on a grill and have
a big old barbecue wedding?

01:00:09.607 --> 01:00:11.106
Okay. Let's do it.
Let's make barbecue.

01:00:11.108 --> 01:00:13.909
We have some lovely cake samples
over here.

01:00:36.667 --> 01:00:39.134
- So, I was thinking Italian.
- Mmm!

01:00:39.136 --> 01:00:42.971
But, Ravyn, French cuisine
is so elegant.

01:00:42.973 --> 01:00:44.373
I agree with you,

01:00:44.375 --> 01:00:46.341
but my mom made the best lasagna
growing up.

01:00:46.343 --> 01:00:47.943
It's one of my favorite
childhood memories.

01:00:47.945 --> 01:00:49.978
So I would love to have that
at my wedding.

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:52.381
I love that you love my lasagna,
Ravyn.

01:00:52.383 --> 01:00:54.783
You know, I can make you that
for your wedding if you want.

01:00:54.785 --> 01:00:56.318
- Okay.
- No.

01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:00.956
We will not be having homemade
food at my son's wedding.

01:01:01.725 --> 01:01:03.425
I'm gonna make it for you.

01:01:03.427 --> 01:01:05.927
- Thank you.
- Oh. No.

01:01:05.929 --> 01:01:08.063
Where's Loretta?

01:01:09.733 --> 01:01:11.166
Mom?

01:01:12.136 --> 01:01:14.036
- Loretta?
- Mom?

01:01:31.822 --> 01:01:33.789
Ooh.

01:01:39.096 --> 01:01:41.430
Yeah. Go check him out.
Check him out.

01:01:41.432 --> 01:01:43.331
Ref, he's leg-whipping him!
Come on!

01:01:43.333 --> 01:01:45.167
Get in the game!

01:01:48.472 --> 01:01:51.740
All right, guys. It's all right.
Have a seat. Have a seat.

01:03:08.986 --> 01:03:10.285
What happened?

01:03:11.288 --> 01:03:13.121
You got hit really hard.

01:03:13.123 --> 01:03:14.523
Came out of nowhere.

01:03:19.463 --> 01:03:21.963
- You take it easy.
- Is it bad?

01:03:22.533 --> 01:03:25.200
I don't know,
but the nurse is gonna come in

01:03:25.202 --> 01:03:27.202
and tell us more about it
in a little bit, okay?

01:03:28.305 --> 01:03:30.272
Jeremy, look.

01:03:30.274 --> 01:03:31.406
I'm sorry.

01:03:32.176 --> 01:03:35.076
I feel like this is my fault.

01:03:35.412 --> 01:03:37.312
I pushed you guys way too hard.

01:03:38.582 --> 01:03:40.949
The team can't win without me.

01:03:41.552 --> 01:03:44.219
They definitely can't win
without your leadership.

01:03:46.356 --> 01:03:48.156
Jeremy Lane?

01:03:48.525 --> 01:03:50.058
My name is Cindy Ware.

01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:51.426
I'm one of the E.R.
nurse practitioners.

01:03:51.428 --> 01:03:52.894
I work with Dr. Hawkins.

01:03:52.896 --> 01:03:55.163
I'm here to talk to you
about your knee.

01:03:55.532 --> 01:03:57.499
Got some good news.
It's a sprain.

01:03:59.236 --> 01:04:01.536
You're gonna be off of your knee
for at least two weeks,

01:04:01.538 --> 01:04:03.438
on crutches, okay?

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:06.174
Gonna have to keep the knee
wrapped, elevated, iced.

01:04:06.176 --> 01:04:08.076
And I'm assuming the team has
a trainer.

01:04:08.078 --> 01:04:09.578
- Yeah.
- You'll work with the trainer.

01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:11.279
They'll rehab your knee.

01:04:11.281 --> 01:04:13.515
Then you'll follow up
with an orthopedic doctor, okay?

01:04:13.517 --> 01:04:15.417
Any questions for me?

01:04:15.419 --> 01:04:17.152
Okay.
Thank you.

01:04:21.925 --> 01:04:25.260
I'm not gonna sit on a bench and
watch everyone play without me.

01:04:26.330 --> 01:04:30.298
Jeremy... listen to me.

01:04:31.001 --> 01:04:34.202
When I was in high school,
I got in some trouble.

01:04:35.405 --> 01:04:37.439
I had to sit out a couple games.

01:04:38.041 --> 01:04:39.241
It was hard.

01:04:40.077 --> 01:04:42.010
I wanted to quit.

01:04:42.479 --> 01:04:45.914
But Coach Z, he wouldn't let me.

01:04:45.916 --> 01:04:48.183
He still won't let me.

01:04:49.953 --> 01:04:54.189
So, no matter how hard it is,
you're gonna recover,

01:04:54.191 --> 01:04:57.025
and you're gonna get
back out on the field and play.

01:04:57.628 --> 01:05:02.163
Remember --
You're a part of this team.

01:05:07.004 --> 01:05:08.436
Thanks, Coach.

01:05:14.544 --> 01:05:16.211
I got to go.

01:05:16.213 --> 01:05:17.979
I'll check on you
in a little bit, okay?

01:05:17.981 --> 01:05:19.347
Okay.

01:05:34.965 --> 01:05:36.164
What's going on?

01:05:36.166 --> 01:05:37.499
Hey.

01:05:38.268 --> 01:05:40.168
Grandma fell.

01:05:40.537 --> 01:05:44.139
What?
Is she okay?

01:05:44.141 --> 01:05:45.507
I don't know.

01:05:45.509 --> 01:05:48.977
I brought you some stuff
I was gonna give you.

01:05:48.979 --> 01:05:52.147
She had significant head trauma
from the fall.

01:05:52.149 --> 01:05:55.417
Her skull was fractured, and the
internal hemorrhage in her brain

01:05:55.419 --> 01:05:59.487
caused her to stop breathing,
and... we just couldn't save her.

01:05:59.489 --> 01:06:01.389
I'm so sorry.

01:06:06.129 --> 01:06:09.564
- It's all right, sweetie.
- ¶ Oh, my beloved ¶

01:06:10.067 --> 01:06:13.435
¶ I have wept for you ¶

01:06:15.172 --> 01:06:19.074
¶ The pain and the heartache ¶

01:06:19.076 --> 01:06:23.044
¶ You've been walking through ¶

01:06:24.281 --> 01:06:27.716
¶ I see your troubles ¶

01:06:27.718 --> 01:06:31.353
¶ Breaking you down ¶

01:06:33.323 --> 01:06:37.292
¶ You're looking for something ¶

01:06:37.294 --> 01:06:41.363
¶ You still haven't found ¶

01:06:42.666 --> 01:06:45.734
¶ Take heart ¶

01:06:45.736 --> 01:06:49.771
¶ I have overcome ¶

01:06:52.109 --> 01:06:55.610
¶ Come and rest here ¶

01:06:55.612 --> 01:07:00.415
¶ Inside my love ¶

01:07:26.209 --> 01:07:30.178
¶ Oh, my Father... ¶

01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:33.148
This all seems so silly now.

01:07:35.252 --> 01:07:38.686
¶ Long have I waited ¶

01:07:38.688 --> 01:07:43.358
¶ For your eyes to see ¶

01:07:44.394 --> 01:07:47.395
¶ My love is here ¶

01:07:47.397 --> 01:07:51.766
¶ Oh, to make you new ¶

01:07:53.470 --> 01:07:56.271
¶ Open your heart ¶

01:07:56.273 --> 01:08:01.209
¶ To this love I have for you ¶

01:08:02.746 --> 01:08:05.580
¶ In my heart ¶

01:08:05.582 --> 01:08:09.517
¶ Love burns like a fire ¶

01:08:11.721 --> 01:08:14.322
¶ For you ¶

01:08:14.324 --> 01:08:18.827
¶ My beloved, my desire ¶

01:08:28.238 --> 01:08:30.171
- ¶ Run to me ¶
- Alexa.

01:08:30.173 --> 01:08:32.140
¶ Run to me ¶

01:08:32.142 --> 01:08:36.743
¶ My love will save you ¶

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:39.413
¶ Run to me ¶

01:08:39.416 --> 01:08:40.849
¶ Run to me ¶

01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:42.250
How's it going?

01:08:43.185 --> 01:08:45.153
The flowers were thoughtful.

01:08:49.459 --> 01:08:52.260
I'm sorry for your loss.

01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:55.497
Do you have the designs ready
for the DuBose estate?

01:08:55.499 --> 01:08:58.566
- It was due yesterday.
- Brent, I haven't had the time.

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:00.535
This isn't working out.

01:09:00.537 --> 01:09:03.604
Even when you're here,
you're not here.

01:09:03.607 --> 01:09:07.475
I hate to do this, Alexa, but
I'm gonna have to let you go.

01:09:09.179 --> 01:09:10.545
Okay.

01:09:12.482 --> 01:09:14.582
Get me Christopher DuBose
on the phone.

01:09:23.225 --> 01:09:25.260
Maybe this is all for the best.

01:09:25.261 --> 01:09:28.662
Mm.
I've never been fired before.

01:09:29.399 --> 01:09:30.765
I didn't mean it like that.

01:09:30.767 --> 01:09:33.468
I just meant there's a lot
going on and...

01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:34.935
and we got to plan this funeral.

01:09:34.938 --> 01:09:36.770
Yeah. I'm not ready to deal
with that right now.

01:09:36.773 --> 01:09:38.473
Well, we have to deal with it.

01:09:38.475 --> 01:09:40.508
No. We're planning
a wedding right now.

01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:41.876
Okay.
I'll plan the funeral --

01:09:41.877 --> 01:09:43.545
Stop saying "funeral."

01:09:43.546 --> 01:09:44.612
Okay.

01:09:44.613 --> 01:09:45.779
Well, stop saying "okay."

01:09:45.782 --> 01:09:47.916
Then what do you want me to say?

01:09:47.917 --> 01:09:50.417
This isn't just happening
to you.

01:09:50.886 --> 01:09:54.389
Okay. I've taken care of
your mom for a long time, too.

01:09:54.391 --> 01:09:56.424
My daughter is getting married
too.

01:09:56.426 --> 01:09:58.293
I work a full-time job,

01:09:58.295 --> 01:10:01.262
and I have been nothing
but supportive of you.

01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:06.768
I feel like my whole life
is just supporting you.

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:16.311
Look. I love supporting you,
but I need some support back.

01:10:18.281 --> 01:10:20.348
I-I lost her, too.

01:10:21.651 --> 01:10:24.719
I just wish
we could have said goodbye.

01:10:35.265 --> 01:10:36.798
This is not a good time, Jezi.

01:10:40.437 --> 01:10:43.905
I am so sorry for your loss.

01:10:46.977 --> 01:10:48.710
Alexa.

01:10:48.712 --> 01:10:52.680
I have been up all night
thinking about it.

01:10:52.682 --> 01:10:55.316
I should have been
paying attention.

01:10:55.318 --> 01:10:57.352
I feel partly responsible.

01:10:57.354 --> 01:10:59.520
What's so funny?

01:10:59.522 --> 01:11:03.391
It's incredible how you can make
my mother's death all about you.

01:11:03.393 --> 01:11:05.326
Alexa.

01:11:05.328 --> 01:11:07.295
You guys, Nathan and I
have been up all night talking.

01:11:07.297 --> 01:11:09.497
We decided to take the pressure
off of everyone and elope.

01:11:09.499 --> 01:11:10.965
- What?
- What?

01:11:10.967 --> 01:11:13.668
- Absolutely not!
- No, you are <i>not</i> eloping.

01:11:13.670 --> 01:11:14.836
We're united on this.

01:11:14.838 --> 01:11:16.271
No.
Not my only son.

01:11:16.273 --> 01:11:17.639
Not my only daughter.

01:11:17.641 --> 01:11:20.008
This is my decision.

01:11:20.010 --> 01:11:22.310
I knew it. Nathan would
never agree to this.

01:11:22.312 --> 01:11:23.878
This was our decision.

01:11:25.715 --> 01:11:27.415
Okay.
Okay.

01:11:27.417 --> 01:11:30.051
Do you have Clara Cono--
What's her name?

01:11:30.053 --> 01:11:31.786
- Yes.
- Can you call her?

01:11:31.788 --> 01:11:35.957
We are having a wedding
in my backyard in a month, okay?

01:11:35.959 --> 01:11:37.558
I'm not losing this, too.

01:11:40.597 --> 01:11:42.497
Clara?

01:11:44.401 --> 01:11:47.001
I can't take this anymore, Kels.
No one's listening to me.

01:11:47.003 --> 01:11:49.404
- I want to elope!
- What?

01:11:49.406 --> 01:11:52.974
Ravyn, I just drove all night to
start my maid-of-honor duties.

01:11:52.976 --> 01:11:54.742
I know.
Don't worry.

01:11:54.744 --> 01:11:56.611
My mother won't let me.

01:11:56.613 --> 01:11:58.446
Neither will my
soon-to-be mother-in-law.

01:11:58.448 --> 01:12:00.682
You know, I've had pushback
on every idea I have had

01:12:00.684 --> 01:12:02.083
for my own wedding.

01:12:02.085 --> 01:12:04.719
She's so controlling,
and all they do is fight.

01:12:04.721 --> 01:12:07.955
They never stop fighting,
and nobody asks me what I want.

01:12:07.957 --> 01:12:09.757
Ravyn, what do you want?

01:12:10.427 --> 01:12:11.993
I don't even know anymore, Kels.

01:12:11.995 --> 01:12:13.695
That's what I'm here for.

01:12:13.697 --> 01:12:16.431
I know. I just wish my mom
would say that to me.

01:12:16.433 --> 01:12:18.533
I understand,
but have you told her?

01:12:18.535 --> 01:12:20.735
I just want her to be happy,
you know?

01:12:20.737 --> 01:12:23.338
By giving up your own happiness
on your wedding day?

01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:25.506
Ravyn, it's okay
to want what you want.

01:12:25.508 --> 01:12:27.909
'Cause deep down, I'm sure your
mother wants you to be happy.

01:12:27.911 --> 01:12:29.377
But she can't make you happy

01:12:29.379 --> 01:12:31.479
if you don't tell her
what you want.

01:12:31.481 --> 01:12:32.880
That's true.

01:12:32.882 --> 01:12:36.417
I can see it all in my mind.

01:12:36.419 --> 01:12:39.520
We can string lights
on these lights here.

01:12:39.522 --> 01:12:43.758
Do you want to elope?
Because if you do, then do it.

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:45.626
You know me.
I don't want to elope.

01:12:46.663 --> 01:12:47.695
That's what I thought.

01:12:50.467 --> 01:12:53.868
The chairs for the ceremony
can go there,

01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:56.671
and the arch can go there.

01:12:56.673 --> 01:12:58.005
Does that sound okay, Ravyn?

01:12:58.007 --> 01:12:59.907
Yeah.
I actually like that.

01:12:59.909 --> 01:13:03.644
Let's put the reception
and dancing over there.

01:13:03.646 --> 01:13:05.380
How come no one
is recording this?

01:13:05.382 --> 01:13:07.115
- Jezi, get your phone out!
- Oh! Right, right, right.

01:13:07.117 --> 01:13:09.784
We need to be putting this
on the social.

01:13:09.786 --> 01:13:11.452
You know what I wish?

01:13:11.454 --> 01:13:14.589
I wish we would have trimmed
that tree.

01:13:14.591 --> 01:13:16.891
Don't --
I can work with that I have.

01:13:16.893 --> 01:13:19.026
Now, point me to the direction
of the kitchen

01:13:19.028 --> 01:13:20.995
so I can scope it out
for the caterer.

01:13:25.502 --> 01:13:28.102
Beau told me you were here.
I'm so sorry for your loss.

01:13:28.104 --> 01:13:31.606
Oh, thank you.
You're such a sweet neighbor.

01:13:35.945 --> 01:13:39.080
Who passed away?

01:13:39.082 --> 01:13:40.581
My mother.

01:13:40.583 --> 01:13:41.849
I'm so sorry.

01:13:41.851 --> 01:13:44.886
She seemed fine
at the engagement party.

01:13:46.623 --> 01:13:50.591
Mom, I want to have the wedding
and the funeral together.

01:13:50.593 --> 01:13:52.160
Wait.

01:13:52.162 --> 01:13:54.462
I think that we should
discuss this.

01:13:54.464 --> 01:13:56.030
There's nothing to discuss.

01:13:56.032 --> 01:13:58.032
Okay. We can at least,
you know, talk about it.

01:13:58.034 --> 01:14:00.001
No.

01:14:00.003 --> 01:14:02.870
I want to honor my grandmother's
life at my wedding.

01:14:07.944 --> 01:14:10.044
Okay, honey.

01:14:10.046 --> 01:14:12.947
Are you sure that this is
what you want?

01:14:13.583 --> 01:14:15.883
I just thought
she would be there, you know?

01:14:15.885 --> 01:14:17.585
I know.
Me too.

01:14:17.587 --> 01:14:19.053
This way, she is.

01:14:19.055 --> 01:14:20.688
Yeah.

01:14:21.458 --> 01:14:22.990
Do I get a say in this at all?

01:14:22.992 --> 01:14:24.826
- No.
- No.

01:14:25.495 --> 01:14:26.694
I love you.

01:14:26.696 --> 01:14:28.196
Love you.

01:15:07.770 --> 01:15:10.137
Please. Just one last time
as the Taylors.

01:15:10.139 --> 01:15:12.807
It's -- I know it's dorky,
but I want to -- Yeah.

01:15:12.809 --> 01:15:15.576
I get one thing.
I get one thing.

01:15:15.578 --> 01:15:16.911
And I want to squeeze tight.

01:15:19.816 --> 01:15:21.649
I love you guys.

01:15:21.651 --> 01:15:23.184
I love being a Taylor.

01:15:23.186 --> 01:15:24.952
We'll miss you, kiddo.

01:15:24.954 --> 01:15:27.722
I'm gonna miss being a Taylor.

01:15:27.724 --> 01:15:29.290
I'm gonna miss you.

01:15:30.994 --> 01:15:34.862
Sorry to break this up,
but I've got to go get Nathan.

01:15:34.864 --> 01:15:36.797
Aw!

01:15:36.799 --> 01:15:39.033
- Excuse me.
- All right.

01:15:39.636 --> 01:15:41.202
Drive safe.

01:15:41.204 --> 01:15:42.803
I love you guys.

01:15:42.805 --> 01:15:44.972
- We love you.
- We love you.

01:16:06.329 --> 01:16:08.229
Oh, my God.

01:16:12.869 --> 01:16:14.135
What happened?

01:16:14.137 --> 01:16:16.938
It was supposed to go
the other way!

01:16:17.307 --> 01:16:19.273
You did not say that, ma'am.

01:16:19.275 --> 01:16:21.008
You should have been
more specific.

01:16:21.010 --> 01:16:23.878
Why would I want it
to fall here?

01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:26.681
Why did you want it to fall
at all?!

01:16:26.683 --> 01:16:29.116
I was trying to help your mother
trim the trees!

01:16:29.118 --> 01:16:32.920
Jezi, are you out of your mind?

01:16:32.922 --> 01:16:34.589
Why?

01:16:35.191 --> 01:16:37.892
Why would you do this
without talking to me first?

01:16:38.261 --> 01:16:40.928
I wanted to surprise you!

01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:42.863
Well, we are very surprised.

01:16:42.865 --> 01:16:45.366
Now, <i>this</i> is Instagram-worthy.

01:16:46.302 --> 01:16:49.170
This was really important to me!

01:16:52.041 --> 01:16:53.841
And now it's ruined.

01:16:53.843 --> 01:16:56.344
I'm sorry!

01:16:56.346 --> 01:16:57.845
I have to call Nathan.

01:16:57.847 --> 01:16:59.880
No!
No.

01:17:00.750 --> 01:17:02.650
Oh, you!

01:17:05.121 --> 01:17:06.687
Sorry for the inconvenience.

01:17:14.864 --> 01:17:17.198
I ruined everything.

01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:19.767
Well, let's not be so dramatic.

01:17:19.769 --> 01:17:23.638
Alexa, I know
that I can be dramatic,

01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:27.208
but I think this qualifies
as drama.

01:17:27.210 --> 01:17:30.378
I destroyed something
that was important to Ravyn.

01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:32.113
Yeah.

01:17:32.115 --> 01:17:35.650
This is probably the worst thing
that could have happened.

01:17:36.252 --> 01:17:38.753
Nathan's gonna kill me.

01:17:38.755 --> 01:17:40.721
No.
Paul's gonna kill me.

01:17:40.723 --> 01:17:42.757
Would you just kill me first?

01:17:42.759 --> 01:17:45.126
Jezi, I was being sarcastic.

01:17:45.128 --> 01:17:47.928
Everyone's okay.
It's just an arch.

01:17:48.264 --> 01:17:51.766
Thank goodness no one got hurt.
No one died.

01:17:55.171 --> 01:17:57.204
But he could.

01:17:57.206 --> 01:17:58.072
Who?

01:17:58.074 --> 01:17:59.740
Nathan.

01:18:00.777 --> 01:18:03.077
He's getting deployed.

01:18:03.946 --> 01:18:07.782
He's going, and I...
I can't go with him.

01:18:08.384 --> 01:18:12.753
I... I can't keep him safe
anymore.

01:18:12.755 --> 01:18:14.722
I'm so sorry, Jezi.

01:18:15.391 --> 01:18:17.024
But I am very proud

01:18:17.026 --> 01:18:20.861
that my future son-in-law
is serving our country.

01:18:20.863 --> 01:18:23.330
I never wanted him to join
the Navy.

01:18:23.332 --> 01:18:25.332
I want him home with me.

01:18:25.334 --> 01:18:27.134
Of course you do.

01:18:28.204 --> 01:18:30.271
But he is making a home
of his own now.

01:18:30.273 --> 01:18:32.873
I'm not ready to accept that
yet.

01:18:32.875 --> 01:18:35.476
I mean, I don't think
we're ever ready.

01:18:37.046 --> 01:18:39.980
No one gave us a handbook
on how to raise these kids,

01:18:39.982 --> 01:18:44.285
let alone instructions
on how to let them go.

01:18:44.287 --> 01:18:48.022
But I don't have to let him go.
I'm too busy planning a wedding.

01:18:48.024 --> 01:18:49.490
Exactly.

01:18:49.492 --> 01:18:52.259
If you're too busy, you're gonna
miss every single moment

01:18:52.261 --> 01:18:55.429
that you have with him
right now.

01:18:55.431 --> 01:18:56.964
That's true.

01:18:56.966 --> 01:18:59.467
I just had to get
this stupid tree down.

01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:06.173
Alexa...

01:19:07.310 --> 01:19:10.478
...I am the queen of avoidance.

01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:12.146
I know that.

01:19:14.050 --> 01:19:16.917
I am so sorry for the way
I treated you

01:19:16.919 --> 01:19:19.787
when our sons
were in high school.

01:19:20.223 --> 01:19:22.389
I was a rotten friend.

01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:25.392
I was jealous of you

01:19:25.394 --> 01:19:28.195
because you had the courage
to do the right thing.

01:19:28.197 --> 01:19:30.798
And now I've just been trying
to pretend

01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:33.134
like nothing ever happened.

01:19:34.837 --> 01:19:38.939
But really... I've just been
trying to win you back.

01:19:39.408 --> 01:19:41.108
How?

01:19:42.044 --> 01:19:44.278
By one-upping me
with my own daughter?

01:19:46.215 --> 01:19:48.082
Wait.

01:19:48.084 --> 01:19:49.950
Is that what you think
that I've been doing?

01:19:49.952 --> 01:19:51.852
Yeah. That's exactly
what you were doing.

01:19:51.854 --> 01:19:53.821
No.

01:19:53.823 --> 01:19:55.289
I've been trying to prove to you

01:19:55.291 --> 01:19:57.158
that I could be a good friend
to you again.

01:19:57.160 --> 01:19:59.360
By paying for everything?

01:20:00.096 --> 01:20:04.532
No. By helping Ravyn,
I was trying to help you.

01:20:05.134 --> 01:20:06.534
Oh, my gosh.

01:20:06.536 --> 01:20:09.436
I <i>really</i> made a mess
of everything.

01:20:10.973 --> 01:20:15.876
Alexa, I am so sorry
for everything.

01:21:25.915 --> 01:21:30.351
You were right, honey.
That dress is perfect for you.

01:21:32.889 --> 01:21:34.505
Thanks, Mom.

01:21:34.506 --> 01:21:36.122
You know, I always thought I
was being a better mother to you

01:21:36.125 --> 01:21:38.425
than my mom was to me.

01:21:38.427 --> 01:21:40.427
And it turns out
I'm just following

01:21:40.429 --> 01:21:42.029
in some of her footsteps.

01:21:42.031 --> 01:21:43.397
Mom.

01:21:44.667 --> 01:21:46.967
You know, I'm still really upset
with myself

01:21:46.969 --> 01:21:49.536
that you were afraid to tell me
who you were marrying.

01:21:49.538 --> 01:21:53.507
I don't want you to be afraid
to tell me anything, okay?

01:21:53.509 --> 01:21:55.109
I know, Mom.

01:21:55.111 --> 01:21:57.478
I'm so sorry I didn't tell you
about Nathan.

01:21:57.480 --> 01:21:59.980
I really didn't mean for it
to go that long.

01:21:59.982 --> 01:22:01.015
Hey.

01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:07.021
You think mother-daughter
relationships are hard?

01:22:07.023 --> 01:22:09.323
Marriage is even harder.

01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:13.193
But it's also beautiful.

01:22:13.195 --> 01:22:14.929
And when things get hard,

01:22:14.931 --> 01:22:17.698
I want you to be able to talk
to me about it, okay?

01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:19.199
I know.
I know.

01:22:19.201 --> 01:22:22.069
I need to start this next season
of my life

01:22:22.071 --> 01:22:23.671
saying exactly what I think.

01:22:23.673 --> 01:22:25.639
Yeah.
Always be honest with Nathan.

01:22:25.641 --> 01:22:27.174
Even about the little things,

01:22:27.176 --> 01:22:29.944
because nothing stays little
forever.

01:22:31.213 --> 01:22:35.549
So, I talked to Nathan,
and we both agree

01:22:35.551 --> 01:22:38.619
that you should have
Grandma's wedding ring --

01:22:38.621 --> 01:22:40.254
if you want it.

01:22:40.256 --> 01:22:42.156
Mom, I thought it was tradition

01:22:42.158 --> 01:22:45.292
for you to wear it
now that she's gone.

01:22:45.294 --> 01:22:50.965
Yeah. Well, we're breaking old
patterns one stone at a time.

01:22:51.534 --> 01:22:54.268
Thank you, Mom.
I would be so honored.

01:22:54.270 --> 01:22:56.537
Now you have something old.

01:22:58.441 --> 01:23:00.040
<i>Te amo.</i>

01:23:00.443 --> 01:23:02.376
<i>Te amo.</i>

01:23:04.413 --> 01:23:06.013
Come in.

01:23:09.652 --> 01:23:13.020
You look gorgeous.

01:23:18.427 --> 01:23:20.227
Got you something blue.

01:23:20.229 --> 01:23:21.695
Thanks.

01:23:25.568 --> 01:23:27.434
Can I join you ladies?

01:23:27.436 --> 01:23:29.136
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

01:23:34.143 --> 01:23:38.612
Ravyn... I want to lend this
to you.

01:23:39.181 --> 01:23:41.548
It belonged
to Nathan's grandmother.

01:23:42.084 --> 01:23:46.153
She carried it down the aisle,
I carried it down the aisle,

01:23:46.155 --> 01:23:49.089
and now you can carry on
the tradition.

01:23:49.091 --> 01:23:50.457
Thank you, Jezi.

01:23:51.127 --> 01:23:53.560
And now you have
something borrowed.

01:23:53.562 --> 01:23:54.695
I'll see you out there.

01:23:54.697 --> 01:23:56.030
Okay.

01:23:57.099 --> 01:23:59.133
- Bye.
- See you there.

01:24:00.636 --> 01:24:03.103
So, are you ready?

01:24:03.105 --> 01:24:04.238
Are <i>you</i> ready?

01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:07.374
¶ There's a constant thread ¶

01:24:07.376 --> 01:24:10.544
Who is ever ready
for this moment?

01:24:12.581 --> 01:24:17.217
¶ Keeps pulling me along ¶

01:24:20.556 --> 01:24:26.093
¶ And it's never broken yet ¶

01:24:29.298 --> 01:24:33.767
¶ No matter how it's stretched ¶

01:24:36.105 --> 01:24:40.140
¶ Awaken my soul to the beat
of your heart ¶

01:24:40.142 --> 01:24:43.710
¶ To the beat of your heart ¶

01:24:43.712 --> 01:24:48.382
¶ Keep pulling me close
to where you are ¶

01:24:48.384 --> 01:24:52.319
¶ To where you are ¶

01:24:53.722 --> 01:24:56.423
Who gives this woman
to marry this man?

01:24:56.826 --> 01:24:58.625
Her mother and I do.

01:25:13.442 --> 01:25:15.776
We're gathered here today
in front of each other

01:25:15.778 --> 01:25:18.278
and in front of God

01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:23.250
to witness the marriage of
Ravyn Taylor and Nathan Adams.

01:25:23.252 --> 01:25:25.352
But before we begin,

01:25:25.354 --> 01:25:30.791
let's spend a moment and honor
the life of Loretta Gomez.

01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:33.594
Who has the urn?

01:25:34.864 --> 01:25:37.698
Ravyn, who's got the urn?

01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:38.866
- Do you have it?
- No.

01:25:40.269 --> 01:25:42.236
Oh! Mm.

01:25:42.238 --> 01:25:43.637
I got it. Okay.

01:25:43.639 --> 01:25:44.771
I got it.

01:25:44.773 --> 01:25:46.473
I have it!
I have it --

01:25:46.475 --> 01:25:47.875
Oh, goodness.
I have it!

01:25:47.877 --> 01:25:49.877
Ooh. Ooh.
Okay.

01:25:52.581 --> 01:25:56.750
¶ Keep pulling me close
to where you are ¶

01:25:56.752 --> 01:26:00.721
¶ To where you are ¶

01:26:00.723 --> 01:26:05.159
¶ Oh, awaken my soul to the beat
of your heart ¶

01:26:05.161 --> 01:26:08.495
¶ To the beat of your heart ¶

01:26:09.565 --> 01:26:12.633
¶ Keep pulling me close
to where you are ¶

01:26:12.635 --> 01:26:13.700
Goodbye, Mom.

01:26:13.702 --> 01:26:17.237
¶ To where you are ¶

01:26:17.239 --> 01:26:18.705
Our loss is heaven's gain.

01:26:18.707 --> 01:26:21.308
We'll see you again soon.

01:26:23.812 --> 01:26:29.349
¶ Awaken my soul to the beat
of your heart ¶

01:26:32.521 --> 01:26:38.192
¶ Pulling me close
to where you are ¶

01:26:40.663 --> 01:26:45.966
¶ Awaken my soul
to the beat of your heart ¶

01:26:49.271 --> 01:26:54.441
¶ Pulling me close
to where you are ¶

01:26:54.443 --> 01:26:56.577
Let's get you married.

01:26:56.579 --> 01:27:00.681
¶ Yeah ¶

01:27:04.820 --> 01:27:07.221
¶ Oh, oh ¶

01:27:07.223 --> 01:27:09.590
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

01:27:09.592 --> 01:27:12.826
Nathan, you may kiss your bride.

01:27:41.290 --> 01:27:45.492
We pulled this off...
and I have no idea how.

01:27:45.794 --> 01:27:47.628
Clara Conover.

01:27:47.630 --> 01:27:49.029
So...

01:27:49.031 --> 01:27:51.698
Alexa, you have a gorgeous eye
for design.

01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:53.267
Oh, thank you.

01:27:53.269 --> 01:27:55.435
Well, she should be
an interior designer.

01:27:55.437 --> 01:27:57.904
You're welcome to join my team
any time you want.

01:27:57.906 --> 01:27:59.473
Really?

01:28:01.977 --> 01:28:03.710
That was slick.

01:28:03.712 --> 01:28:05.312
I think I got a job.

01:28:05.314 --> 01:28:06.513
I think you did get a job.

01:28:10.319 --> 01:28:13.420
Well, what do you think, Beau?
You ready to take the next step?

01:28:13.422 --> 01:28:16.390
I'm not getting married
for a long time, Coach.

01:28:16.392 --> 01:28:17.858
One thing at a time here.

01:28:17.860 --> 01:28:20.694
I was talking about football.

01:28:20.696 --> 01:28:23.330
So, you must have heard
about my offer.

01:28:23.332 --> 01:28:25.032
I was actually talking about
next season.

01:28:25.034 --> 01:28:26.633
What are you talking about?

01:28:26.635 --> 01:28:28.902
I was waiting for the right time
to tell you.

01:28:28.904 --> 01:28:30.003
Okay.

01:28:31.774 --> 01:28:33.006
Not at my sister's wedding.

01:28:33.008 --> 01:28:35.776
Okay. No.
Now you got to tell me.

01:28:36.545 --> 01:28:39.346
I got an offer
to be an assistant coach

01:28:39.348 --> 01:28:41.548
with the possibility of becoming
a head coach.

01:28:41.550 --> 01:28:44.851
Hey!
That's great, son!

01:28:44.853 --> 01:28:47.387
Doesn't seem like
such a big detour now, does it?

01:28:47.389 --> 01:28:49.389
Sure doesn't.

01:28:50.526 --> 01:28:52.526
But I'm not gonna take it.

01:28:53.762 --> 01:28:58.332
Beau, as much as I'd love
to have you around,

01:28:58.334 --> 01:29:01.068
you really need to take the time
to think this one through.

01:29:01.070 --> 01:29:02.669
I mean, you were right.

01:29:02.671 --> 01:29:05.105
Coaching a high school program
is fun, but, man,

01:29:05.107 --> 01:29:08.575
it's not near as glamorous
as a big-time college program.

01:29:08.944 --> 01:29:10.777
I don't know about that.

01:29:11.914 --> 01:29:14.648
This wise old man told me
one time,

01:29:14.650 --> 01:29:17.384
"It's not about
your accomplishments.

01:29:17.386 --> 01:29:18.985
It's about who you spend
your time with."

01:29:18.987 --> 01:29:22.789
Okay. Let's go easy
on who you're calling old.

01:29:22.791 --> 01:29:24.558
Wait a minute.

01:29:25.094 --> 01:29:28.428
You'd be willing to help out
our little program here

01:29:28.430 --> 01:29:29.963
and turn down
a big-time college?

01:29:31.567 --> 01:29:34.634
I say let the adventure
continue.

01:29:34.636 --> 01:29:36.703
Hey.
How are you guys doing?

01:29:36.705 --> 01:29:38.004
We're doing great now.

01:29:38.006 --> 01:29:39.873
Okay.
Perfect.

01:29:44.646 --> 01:29:47.481
Why don't parents get
a honeymoon after the wedding?

01:29:47.483 --> 01:29:48.749
We do all the work.

01:29:48.751 --> 01:29:50.684
Yeah.
It should be their gift to us.

01:29:50.686 --> 01:29:51.752
Yeah.

01:29:51.754 --> 01:29:53.487
We did pay for this, after all.

01:29:53.489 --> 01:29:55.155
Yeah.
What do we get?

01:29:55.157 --> 01:29:57.557
- Grandkids.
- Grandkids.

01:29:57.559 --> 01:29:59.593
Don't go there, ladies.

01:29:59.595 --> 01:30:01.128
Yeah. A little too young
to be grandparents.

01:30:01.130 --> 01:30:02.596
Oh, don't worry.

01:30:02.598 --> 01:30:04.831
They have to be together
to have kids.

01:30:04.833 --> 01:30:06.967
Oh!

01:30:15.043 --> 01:30:18.145
To think of Ravyn all alone
in that big house.

01:30:18.147 --> 01:30:20.614
Well, actually, she decided
to move in with us

01:30:20.616 --> 01:30:22.115
until Nathan gets back.

01:30:22.117 --> 01:30:23.817
Oh, you're lucky.

01:30:23.819 --> 01:30:25.519
You get to keep your daughter
a little bit longer.

01:30:25.521 --> 01:30:26.753
Well, don't worry.

01:30:26.755 --> 01:30:28.188
Christmas is right around
the corner,

01:30:28.190 --> 01:30:29.756
and John and I would love it

01:30:29.758 --> 01:30:32.592
if your family would join us
for the holidays.

01:30:32.594 --> 01:30:34.127
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:30:34.129 --> 01:30:36.897
I am
so glad we're friends again.

01:30:36.899 --> 01:30:40.634
Yeah. And, uh, you really don't
have to wait that long.

01:30:40.636 --> 01:30:41.768
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

01:30:41.770 --> 01:30:43.904
We bought the house next door!

01:30:47.576 --> 01:30:50.510
¶ Oh, oh, oh ¶

01:30:50.512 --> 01:30:53.013
¶ Whoa, oh, oh ¶

01:30:53.015 --> 01:30:57.517
¶ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ¶

01:30:57.519 --> 01:30:59.986
¶ Whoa, oh, oh, oh, ¶

01:30:59.988 --> 01:31:04.124
¶ Oh, oh, oh, oh ¶

01:31:04.126 --> 01:31:06.726
¶ Whoa, oh, oh ¶

01:31:06.728 --> 01:31:09.863
¶ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ¶

01:31:09.865 --> 01:31:13.733
¶ Came with the herd,
the beasts who ride the road ¶

01:31:13.735 --> 01:31:17.070
¶ Kings of our kingdom ¶

01:31:17.072 --> 01:31:20.640
¶ Ready to break in, break out,
and break away ¶

01:31:20.642 --> 01:31:24.010
¶ Right until we lose them ¶

01:31:24.012 --> 01:31:27.714
¶ Carry the scars around
like trophy maps ¶

01:31:27.716 --> 01:31:30.884
¶ Of where we've been ¶

01:31:30.886 --> 01:31:33.854
¶ Packing our bootstraps
and treasure maps ¶

01:31:33.856 --> 01:31:37.791
¶ And heading down the road
like ¶

01:31:37.793 --> 01:31:40.994
¶ You'd better run ¶

01:31:40.996 --> 01:31:44.898
¶ Chasing the sun
around the globe ¶

01:31:44.900 --> 01:31:47.234
¶ And we go, we go, we go ¶

01:31:47.236 --> 01:31:51.238
¶ We go prouder
than you'll ever know ¶

01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:54.708
¶ And if you can't run ¶

01:31:54.710 --> 01:31:57.544
¶ You'd better bring out
the big guns ¶

01:31:57.546 --> 01:32:05.986
¶ 'Cause we run, we run, we run,
we run only with the wild ones ¶

01:32:05.988 --> 01:32:08.688
¶ Whoa, oh, oh, oh ¶

01:32:08.690 --> 01:32:12.826
¶ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ¶

01:32:12.828 --> 01:32:15.562
¶ Whoa, oh, oh ¶

01:32:15.564 --> 01:32:18.832
¶ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ¶

01:32:18.834 --> 01:32:22.269
¶ There'll be a time
for tricks and trap-me-downs ¶

01:32:22.271 --> 01:32:25.672
¶ Pulling us under ¶

01:32:25.674 --> 01:32:27.941
¶ We can go spinning, reeling ¶

01:32:27.943 --> 01:32:32.546
¶ And wondering just how long
we've been there ¶

01:32:32.548 --> 01:32:39.252
¶ Now we have found the cry of
hounds across the county line ¶

01:32:39.254 --> 01:32:42.122
¶ Following ryegrass
and jackal tracks ¶

01:32:42.124 --> 01:32:47.127
¶ Until the stars are sleeping
and sleeping and clouds again ¶

01:32:47.129 --> 01:32:53.099
¶ Hosts of sparrows
in the sky now ¶

01:32:53.101 --> 01:32:56.303
¶ You'd better run ¶

01:32:56.305 --> 01:33:00.173
¶ Chasing the sun
around the globe ¶

01:33:00.175 --> 01:33:02.976
¶ And we go, we go, we go ¶

01:33:02.978 --> 01:33:06.813
¶ We go prouder
than you'll ever know ¶

01:33:06.815 --> 01:33:10.116
¶ And if you can't run ¶

01:33:10.118 --> 01:33:14.087
¶ You'd better bring out
the big guns ¶

01:33:14.089 --> 01:33:21.261
¶ 'Cause we run, we run, we run,
we run only with the wild ones ¶

01:33:21.263 --> 01:33:24.831
¶ Runnin' with the wild ones
now ¶

01:33:24.833 --> 01:33:28.201
¶ Runnin' with the wild ones ¶

01:33:28.203 --> 01:33:31.671
¶ Runnin' with the wild ones
now ¶

01:33:31.673 --> 01:33:34.908
¶ We run, we run, we run,
we run, oh, we run ¶

01:33:34.910 --> 01:33:38.645
¶ Runnin' with the wild ones
now ¶

01:33:38.647 --> 01:33:42.048
¶ Runnin' with the wild ones ¶

01:33:42.050 --> 01:33:45.251
¶ Runnin' with the wild ones
now ¶

01:33:45.253 --> 01:33:48.822
¶ We run, we run, we run,
we run, oh, we run ¶

01:33:48.824 --> 01:33:52.092
¶ We run, we run, we run,
we run, oh, we run ¶

01:33:52.094 --> 01:33:57.130
¶ Hosts of sparrows
flying high now ¶

01:33:57.132 --> 01:33:58.898
¶ High now ¶

01:33:58.900 --> 01:34:01.701
¶ Bye now ¶

01:34:01.703 --> 01:34:04.971
¶ You'd better run ¶

01:34:04.973 --> 01:34:08.875
¶ Chasing the sun
around the globe ¶

01:34:08.877 --> 01:34:15.181
¶ And we go, we go, we go, we go
prouder than you'll ever know ¶

01:34:15.183 --> 01:34:18.785
¶ And if you can't run,
you can't run ¶

01:34:18.787 --> 01:34:22.789
¶ You'd better bring out
the big guns ¶

01:34:22.791 --> 01:34:29.429
¶ 'Cause we run, we run, we run,
we run only with the wild ones ¶
