WEBVTT

00:04.433 --> 00:06.433
It's time for the contest

00:06.458 --> 00:09.570
that's taking America by storm,
"stop that deejay.

00:09.851 --> 00:11.476
Fine. Bring it on, chump.

00:11.477 --> 00:13.477
So we got through the holidays
in one piece, right?

00:13.478 --> 00:15.478
but the big bearded guy
in the red suit

00:15.479 --> 00:17.212
deserves one last trivia
shout-out.

00:17.312 --> 00:19.977
Now, we know he didn't deliver
all these presents by himself.

00:20.077 --> 00:23.578
So, name for me all of
Santa's 9 reindeer.

00:23.580 --> 00:26.531
Oh, I know this.
Prancer, Dancer--

01:24.358 --> 01:27.425
Hey, Dave, take a look
at this, would you?

01:27.427 --> 01:30.228
This arrived
at my house last night.

01:30.230 --> 01:32.781
It's a gift
from Harrison Scott.

01:32.783 --> 01:35.600
Your buddy from Vietnam.

01:35.602 --> 01:38.403
"Appreciate everything
you've done for me."

01:38.405 --> 01:41.456
The grips are a replica
of the Vietnam War Memorial.

01:41.458 --> 01:42.624
It's beautiful.

01:42.626 --> 01:43.942
It's expensive.

01:43.944 --> 01:45.794
What's the matter?

01:45.796 --> 01:47.111
A gift like this

01:47.113 --> 01:48.997
would practically drain
all of Harrison's savings.

01:48.999 --> 01:51.416
Now, if you're trying
to get yourself back on your feet,

01:51.418 --> 01:53.051
why would you do something
like that?

01:53.053 --> 01:54.336
You talk to him?

01:54.338 --> 01:55.787
I left 3 messages
where he lives

01:55.789 --> 01:57.288
at New Directions
for Veterans.

01:57.290 --> 01:58.606
He hasn't returned
my calls.

01:58.608 --> 02:00.308
That's only been
since last night.

02:00.310 --> 02:01.626
I phoned his job
this morning.

02:01.628 --> 02:04.929
He hasn't shown up for work
the past two days, either.

02:04.931 --> 02:07.315
I'm worried, Aaron.

02:07.317 --> 02:10.568
Why don't you go out
to Los Angeles and check on him.

02:10.570 --> 02:11.736
What about our caseload?

02:11.738 --> 02:13.638
It'll be fine.
You've got leave coming.

02:13.640 --> 02:15.607
You should go.

02:16.475 --> 02:17.909
Maybe I'll do that.

02:17.911 --> 02:19.110
Thank you.

02:19.112 --> 02:20.829
Sure.

02:32.091 --> 02:34.292
It's staged. They got people
on those programs

02:34.294 --> 02:35.760
they know are gonna fight.

02:35.762 --> 02:37.796
You should've seen
that guy's wife

02:37.798 --> 02:40.331
when he brought his two girlfriends
out on the stage.

02:40.333 --> 02:43.101
Hoo hoo hoo. Punches
flying everywhere.

02:43.103 --> 02:44.886
It's a TV show.

02:44.888 --> 02:46.388
It's fake.

02:46.390 --> 02:49.607
Whoa. Your ass just
got checkmated, homes.

02:49.609 --> 02:51.509
It's checkers, not chess.

02:51.511 --> 02:52.777
King me.

02:52.779 --> 02:55.947
Well, here's the
problem, your majesty.

02:55.949 --> 02:57.816
This right here
where you're playing--

02:57.818 --> 02:58.950
this is our office.

02:58.952 --> 03:01.319
You want to come here,
play a little game,

03:01.321 --> 03:02.654
you gotta pay us rent.

03:02.656 --> 03:03.638
I said king me.

03:03.640 --> 03:05.457
I ain't kidding,
old-timer.

03:05.459 --> 03:07.709
Cough it up, wallet and watch,
both of you.

03:07.711 --> 03:11.663
I faced a lot worse
than you in Korea.

03:11.665 --> 03:13.832
You two-bit punks
don't scare me.

03:13.834 --> 03:16.200
Oh, yeah?

03:17.303 --> 03:19.254
Well, I can get
a whole lot scarier

03:19.256 --> 03:20.338
than this, grandpa.

03:34.236 --> 03:36.053
What's going on?

03:36.055 --> 03:38.055
We've got a possible
spree killer in Cleveland.

03:38.057 --> 03:40.075
Details are sketchy,
but 90 minutes ago

03:40.077 --> 03:42.444
a man shot and killed
two gang members

03:42.446 --> 03:44.395
at a park on the
outskirts of the city.

03:44.397 --> 03:45.149
Why are we thinking spree?

03:45.174 --> 03:47.174
I mean, gang members
shoot each other all the time.

03:47.334 --> 03:48.917
Because a third gang
member fled the scene,

03:48.919 --> 03:51.336
the shooter hunted him
down at a gas station

03:51.338 --> 03:52.720
over a mile away
to finish the job.

03:52.722 --> 03:54.072
Not your typical M.O.
for a gang shooting.

03:54.074 --> 03:55.540
Oh, and there's more.

03:55.542 --> 03:57.074
After the third
gang member was killed,

03:57.076 --> 03:59.544
a fourth person was shot
and killed at a bus stop

03:59.546 --> 04:01.880
less than a half a mile
away from the gas station.

04:01.882 --> 04:02.881
Also gang related?

04:02.883 --> 04:04.015
I don't know.
Details still coming in.

04:04.017 --> 04:06.101
4 homicides, 3 locations,
all within 90 minutes.

04:06.103 --> 04:07.519
We need to hurry.
Wheels up in 15.

04:07.521 --> 04:09.587
I'll let Morgan know.

04:34.947 --> 04:38.282
Can I help you
with something, sir?

04:38.284 --> 04:40.418
How much ammunition
can I buy?

04:40.420 --> 04:42.086
Well, depends
how much you need.

04:45.290 --> 04:47.559
Those.

04:50.146 --> 04:53.064
That's 19.95.

04:53.066 --> 04:55.633
I'm gonna need
a lot more than that.

04:55.635 --> 04:57.101
Ok.

05:47.544 --> 05:49.761
You know, the description
of our unsub is pretty vague.

05:49.763 --> 05:51.162
40s, 50s, rumpled clothing

05:51.164 --> 05:53.081
like they could
have been slept in.

05:53.083 --> 05:54.499
And two witnesses
in the park

05:54.501 --> 05:56.001
said he appeared
to have been drinking.

05:56.003 --> 05:58.003
They could smell
alcohol on him.

05:58.005 --> 05:59.471
The first 3 victims
all had police records--

05:59.473 --> 06:01.640
car theft, aggravated assault,
and drug dealing.

06:01.642 --> 06:04.242
If they involve drugs, the unsub
might be a disgruntled customer.

06:04.244 --> 06:06.678
Sorry. Babysitting
issues at home.

06:06.680 --> 06:09.347
Garcia, did we get confirmation
that the fourth victim

06:09.349 --> 06:10.798
at the bus stop
was not gang affiliated?

06:10.800 --> 06:12.800
That is correct, sir.
Paul Haller, high school senior.

06:12.802 --> 06:14.135
Not an angel, though.

06:14.137 --> 06:17.639
Haller has a few minor
robbery arrests from the past,

06:17.641 --> 06:20.408
and police found a wallet
on his body,

06:20.410 --> 06:23.094
cash and credit cards
belonging to a Sita Patel.

06:23.096 --> 06:24.329
Purse-snatching?

06:24.331 --> 06:25.463
Gang members, mugger.

06:25.465 --> 06:27.032
We might be looking
at a vigilante.

06:27.034 --> 06:28.983
All right, I just got off the phone
with Cleveland P.D.

06:28.985 --> 06:30.485
If we are dealing
with a spree killer,

06:30.487 --> 06:31.937
at least he's on
a slower boil now.

06:31.939 --> 06:33.788
No new incidents reported
in the past hour.

06:33.790 --> 06:35.840
The victim at the gas station
wasn't just shot.

06:35.842 --> 06:38.510
The body showed signs
of having been run over multiple times

06:38.512 --> 06:40.261
by a large vehicle.

06:40.263 --> 06:42.781
That is one way to put
the "over" in overkill.

06:42.783 --> 06:45.150
Morgan, you and JJ go to the park
where the first shooting took place.

06:45.152 --> 06:46.668
Blake, go to the gas
station crime scene,

06:46.670 --> 06:47.886
and as soon as
we can find Sita Patel,

06:47.888 --> 06:50.004
Reid and I will talk to her,
see if she interacted

06:50.006 --> 06:51.806
with the unsub.

06:53.192 --> 06:54.993
I was walking to work.

06:54.995 --> 06:57.145
The boy grabbed my handbag,

06:57.147 --> 06:59.497
and then when I tried
to hold on, he yanked hard,

06:59.499 --> 07:00.498
and I fell.

07:00.500 --> 07:01.633
Did anyone else
see the attack.

07:01.635 --> 07:03.501
Many people.
But they did nothing.

07:03.503 --> 07:04.769
Nobody stayed to help?

07:04.771 --> 07:07.238
Only one, a man.

07:07.240 --> 07:09.574
Did he say anything to you?

07:09.576 --> 07:11.643
He asked me which
direction the boy went.

07:11.645 --> 07:13.128
I told him and he left.

07:13.130 --> 07:15.630
Did the man leave
on foot or in a vehicle?

07:15.632 --> 07:18.316
I didn't see.

07:18.318 --> 07:20.335
He was very calm.

07:20.337 --> 07:22.671
Calm and determined.

07:26.092 --> 07:28.893
Uh-huh. All right,
thanks for your help.

07:28.895 --> 07:31.896
Will you have your driver call me
if he remembers anything else?

07:31.898 --> 07:33.982
Appreciate that.

07:33.984 --> 07:36.351
Well, not exactly
an outpouring of grief

07:36.353 --> 07:37.569
from the locals.

07:37.571 --> 07:39.521
Victims were bad news.

07:39.523 --> 07:41.356
Take a look at this.

07:41.358 --> 07:42.991
The street sweeper
had to go around

07:42.993 --> 07:44.826
whatever
was parked here.

07:44.828 --> 07:46.394
I just got off the phone
with the street-sweeping team.

07:46.396 --> 07:48.830
They said their truck passed by
approximately 15 minutes

07:48.832 --> 07:50.865
before the 911 call
came in about the shooting.

07:50.867 --> 07:53.501
That means the car was
obviously parked there then,

07:53.503 --> 07:55.503
but gone before
the police responded.

07:55.505 --> 07:57.005
Do we have a vehicle
description?

07:57.007 --> 07:59.340
They said it was a two-tone
brown and beige SUV.

07:59.342 --> 08:01.710
Out of state plates,
and no license number.

08:02.795 --> 08:04.262
Street-sweeping team
said the car

08:04.264 --> 08:05.764
was packed full of boxes
and clothes.

08:05.766 --> 08:08.233
The unsub was described
as looking disheveled.

08:08.235 --> 08:11.269
All right, so was
the person in the car

08:11.271 --> 08:13.038
a witness to the killings

08:13.040 --> 08:15.807
or was he the killer himself?

08:18.044 --> 08:21.062
So, Harrison didn't give you
any indication

08:21.064 --> 08:22.697
where he might have gone?

08:22.699 --> 08:25.316
No. We asked his roommates,
checked the local jails

08:25.318 --> 08:26.534
and hospitals. Nothing.

08:26.536 --> 08:28.153
Did you or anybody else

08:28.155 --> 08:30.438
notice a change in him
recently?

08:30.440 --> 08:33.408
Mr. Scott did seem a little different,
now that you mention it.

08:33.409 --> 08:35.943
In what way?
Angry? Depressed?

08:35.945 --> 08:38.462
No. We see a lot of that here
and know how to deal with it.

08:38.465 --> 08:41.499
No, with Mr. Scott
it was...

08:41.501 --> 08:43.967
I don't know.
He'd stare right through you,

08:43.970 --> 08:46.004
like his mind was
a million miles away.

08:46.006 --> 08:49.224
Were any of his clothes
or personal belongings missing?

08:49.226 --> 08:51.226
It's hard to say.
Our participants

08:51.228 --> 08:53.311
have so few possessions
to begin with.

08:53.313 --> 08:55.680
Ms. Grant, give me
a chance to find him,

08:55.682 --> 08:58.600
to try to convince him
to come back.

08:58.602 --> 09:00.819
We have a very long
waiting list,

09:00.821 --> 09:02.237
so, unfortunately,
our policy

09:02.239 --> 09:04.355
about unauthorized absences
is very strict.

09:04.357 --> 09:07.242
After 3 days, the participant
loses their spot.

09:07.244 --> 09:09.110
Mr. Scott's been gone
two days already,

09:09.112 --> 09:13.114
so that leaves you
less than 24 hours.

09:13.983 --> 09:16.150
I--

09:16.152 --> 09:17.485
Thank you.

09:35.337 --> 09:36.671
Ok, honey.

09:36.673 --> 09:37.889
All right, bye-bye.

09:37.891 --> 09:39.557
Mmm.

09:47.016 --> 09:48.483
Terry?

09:48.485 --> 09:49.984
What are you doing here?

09:49.986 --> 09:52.954
Terry, you're not supposed
to be here. You know that.

09:52.956 --> 09:55.490
Terry--Terry, please.
Terry, no, don't.

09:55.492 --> 09:57.692
Don't! Don't!
Don't do this!

09:57.694 --> 09:59.026
Terry, stop!

10:01.081 --> 10:03.498
Terry, no! Stop,
Terry! Stop!

10:03.500 --> 10:04.866
Ow!

10:06.686 --> 10:07.986
A restraining order?

10:07.988 --> 10:09.504
I'll call the cops on you.
I swear it! Aah!

10:09.506 --> 10:11.506
This was sent to me
at my job.

10:11.508 --> 10:13.141
In front of my clients,
in front of my--

10:13.143 --> 10:14.709
That's 'cause you never opened
the door to the process server!

10:14.711 --> 10:15.693
You shut up!

10:15.695 --> 10:16.928
No!

10:16.930 --> 10:19.264
What do you think about
that restraining order now?

10:19.266 --> 10:21.349
Hey!

10:21.351 --> 10:23.701
Who the hell are you?

10:23.703 --> 10:26.187
Get your hand off her neck.

10:26.189 --> 10:27.772
Just go back
to your cardboard box.

10:27.774 --> 10:29.357
This doesn't concern you.

10:32.678 --> 10:34.662
I said beat it.

10:34.664 --> 10:36.281
Whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

10:36.283 --> 10:37.866
Sir--
Ohh!

10:37.868 --> 10:39.500
Ohh!

10:52.464 --> 10:54.515
Anything
from Sita Patel?

10:54.517 --> 10:56.684
The man who asked which way
the purse-snatcher went

10:56.686 --> 10:58.386
matches the description
of the unsub.

10:58.388 --> 10:59.854
How did it go
at the gas station?

10:59.856 --> 11:01.689
Maybe it's just me, but if I
saw a person gunned down

11:01.691 --> 11:05.927
and run over by a car
a half a dozen times, I'd remember it.

11:05.929 --> 11:07.896
Let me guess--witnesses
are drawing a blank.

11:07.898 --> 11:09.247
"It all happened
so fast."

11:09.249 --> 11:12.567
No surveillance cameras
at the gas station either.

11:12.569 --> 11:14.452
It's a high-crime area
and the victims were criminals.

11:14.454 --> 11:16.654
The neighborhood could be looking
at this as a problem solved.

11:16.656 --> 11:18.489
There's been
another shooting.

11:20.075 --> 11:22.460
My ex grabbed my throat,

11:22.462 --> 11:25.279
and the next thing I know,
this guy was in the yard

11:25.281 --> 11:27.582
and he shot Terry
and he took off.

11:27.584 --> 11:29.217
Can you describe
the other guy?

11:29.219 --> 11:32.353
No. Everything
happened so fast.

11:32.355 --> 11:35.089
Coins were found
scattered all around the area,

11:35.091 --> 11:37.725
like somebody emptied out
their pockets?

11:37.727 --> 11:39.327
I didn't notice.

11:39.329 --> 11:41.362
So when we analyze
the coins,

11:41.364 --> 11:44.132
we won't find trace evidence of you
or your ex on them--

11:44.134 --> 11:45.566
no fingerprints--

11:45.568 --> 11:49.704
Ok. Yeah, I think Terry may have
thrown some coins at the guy.

11:49.706 --> 11:51.856
Well, when we get back
to the station,

11:51.858 --> 11:54.859
you can help the police
artist render a likeness?

11:54.861 --> 11:55.860
No.

11:55.862 --> 11:57.195
Excuse me?

11:57.197 --> 11:59.364
You have no idea
what it's been like.

11:59.366 --> 12:03.084
The past two years I wake up
every morning scared to death.

12:03.086 --> 12:06.621
Terry was crazy violent and nobody
would do a single thing about it.

12:06.623 --> 12:08.423
He was issued
a restraining order.

12:08.425 --> 12:10.825
Oh, yeah. You saw how
restrained he was.

12:10.827 --> 12:13.962
You want to see
what he did once?

12:13.964 --> 12:15.630
I was cooking dinner,

12:15.632 --> 12:17.498
he got mad and threw
scalding oil at me.

12:17.500 --> 12:18.883
Did you press charges?

12:18.885 --> 12:21.502
Terry told everyone
it was an accident.

12:21.504 --> 12:22.971
That I dropped a frying pan.

12:22.973 --> 12:25.306
But the police would
have investigated, Madison.

12:25.308 --> 12:27.675
Terry's Mr. Charity fund-raiser,

12:27.677 --> 12:30.511
all-around good guy
at the country club.

12:30.513 --> 12:32.013
It was my word against his.

12:32.015 --> 12:35.033
Please, give me a break.

12:35.035 --> 12:36.367
But it's over now,

12:36.369 --> 12:38.870
thanks to that guy.

12:44.209 --> 12:46.294
I hope you don't find him.

12:47.479 --> 12:49.630
Whoever it was,

12:49.632 --> 12:52.216
I hope he gets away.

13:09.735 --> 13:12.386
What the hell
are you doing here?

13:12.388 --> 13:13.654
We need to talk.

13:13.656 --> 13:16.441
I got nothin' to say.
Now get the hell out of here.

13:16.443 --> 13:18.526
What are you gonna do,
Harrison

13:18.528 --> 13:20.161
punch me?

13:20.163 --> 13:21.996
Hit me over the head
with that lamp?

13:21.998 --> 13:23.981
What happened?

13:26.335 --> 13:30.004
You came a long way for nothing.
That's what happened.

13:31.673 --> 13:35.209
It's been a long time
since I've been in here.

13:35.211 --> 13:39.180
What, 35 years,
maybe more?

13:39.182 --> 13:42.583
There used to be
a pinball machine over there.

13:44.219 --> 13:46.721
I see you're
traveling light.

13:46.723 --> 13:48.890
Packed what I needed.

13:48.892 --> 13:50.391
Don't see anything else.

13:50.393 --> 13:52.060
Like said,

13:52.062 --> 13:54.062
packed what I needed.

13:55.197 --> 13:57.899
Do I need to search
this room for a weapon?

13:57.901 --> 14:01.569
I did not come here
to blow my brains out, Dave.

14:01.571 --> 14:04.906
How the hell did you know
that I'd be here?

14:04.908 --> 14:07.091
Educated guess.
No money, no car.

14:07.093 --> 14:10.495
I figured you'd find
someplace

14:10.497 --> 14:13.431
cheap and familiar.

14:13.433 --> 14:15.967
As you know, we were
stationed at Pendleton.

14:15.969 --> 14:18.636
We spent a lot of time here
before we shipped out.

14:18.638 --> 14:21.389
So, when I called
and found out

14:21.391 --> 14:23.941
that your old pal Pete
still owned this place--

14:23.943 --> 14:25.393
The way you sniff people out,

14:25.395 --> 14:30.181
I should've recommended you
to Recon Division back in 'Nam.

14:35.888 --> 14:38.806
The seal on that
is not broken.

14:38.808 --> 14:39.924
You can check.

14:39.926 --> 14:42.777
I haven't had a drop
in 14 months.

14:42.779 --> 14:45.163
But you brought it along
just in case.

14:45.165 --> 14:48.583
A person doesn't need
to pull the trigger of a gun

14:48.585 --> 14:51.102
to kill himself.

14:51.920 --> 14:55.473
Why, Harrison?
You were doing so well.

14:55.475 --> 14:57.992
I got no answer for that.

14:59.845 --> 15:03.948
I come to the end
of my road, Dave.

15:03.950 --> 15:08.436
I'm just sorry you had to
come so far to see it.

15:53.215 --> 15:54.515
There's somebody at the door.

15:54.517 --> 15:56.717
Go check.

15:56.719 --> 15:58.653
Yeah, who is it?

15:58.655 --> 16:00.054
You know who it is.

16:00.056 --> 16:01.322
What's going on?

16:01.324 --> 16:04.058
I don't know.
It looks like some older dude.

16:05.894 --> 16:08.196
What's the problem, man?
We're busy in there.

16:08.198 --> 16:10.081
You know who I am.

16:10.083 --> 16:12.216
Hell, no .
Am I supposed to?

16:12.218 --> 16:14.485
I know who you are.

16:14.487 --> 16:16.030
Good for you.

16:16.055 --> 16:17.673
Now mosey your ass
back out of here.

16:17.674 --> 16:21.008
I've been waiting
a long time for this.

16:21.010 --> 16:22.409
Ohh!

16:22.411 --> 16:24.745
Hey!

16:51.415 --> 16:53.416
Victims were small-time
meth dealers,

16:53.418 --> 16:55.468
been in and out
of jail for years.

16:55.470 --> 16:56.802
What do you got?

16:56.804 --> 17:00.189
Garcia patched in surveillance video
from the hallway camera.

17:00.191 --> 17:01.924
It's our unsub.

17:01.926 --> 17:04.810
He walks straight to
the meth dealers' apartment,

17:04.811 --> 17:07.713
and that's consistent with his M.O.
of targeting criminals.

17:07.714 --> 17:10.182
But he stumbled on
the first victims by chance.

17:10.184 --> 17:11.483
He sought these out.

17:11.486 --> 17:13.019
He's evolving.

17:13.021 --> 17:15.320
Garcia's trying to pull surveillance video
from the surrounding area.

17:15.323 --> 17:18.390
We're looking for a two-tone SUV
with out of state plates.

17:18.392 --> 17:21.410
He looks straight
into the camera.

17:21.412 --> 17:25.230
He doesn't care who sees him.

17:27.084 --> 17:28.084
You should eat.

17:28.086 --> 17:30.002
Nah, not hungry.

17:30.004 --> 17:32.221
Well, I'll save you
some kung pao beef.

17:32.223 --> 17:35.708
It's a little chewy,
but, uh...

17:35.710 --> 17:37.476
"The early bird
gets the worm,

17:37.478 --> 17:41.180
but the second mouse
gets the cheese."

17:41.182 --> 17:43.249
No.

17:45.969 --> 17:48.854
Want to hear yours?
It's pretty good.

17:48.856 --> 17:52.942
Those hills there.

17:52.944 --> 17:55.027
What about 'em?

17:56.596 --> 18:00.099
My son Thomas
and his wife

18:00.101 --> 18:02.568
live on the other side
of those hills.

18:02.570 --> 18:04.236
In Carlsbad.

18:04.238 --> 18:06.522
The son you haven't
spoken to in a while?

18:06.524 --> 18:09.041
19 years.

18:09.043 --> 18:12.662
I called him out
the blue the other day.

18:14.298 --> 18:15.831
What'd he say?

18:15.833 --> 18:17.917
Hello.

18:17.919 --> 18:20.086
Goodbye.

18:20.088 --> 18:21.754
Don't call again.

18:21.756 --> 18:23.673
That was the gist of it.

18:25.509 --> 18:28.010
I got a grandson

18:28.012 --> 18:31.063
I didn't even know
about, Dave.

18:31.065 --> 18:36.602
I could hear him talking
in the background.

18:38.271 --> 18:40.606
Grandson

18:40.608 --> 18:42.908
on the other side
of the hill.

18:42.910 --> 18:45.828
I ain't never
gonna see him.

18:50.834 --> 18:52.484
Well...

18:52.486 --> 18:53.953
Let's go, then.

18:53.955 --> 18:55.955
No point.

18:55.957 --> 18:58.457
Permission to state
the obvious, sir.

18:58.459 --> 19:00.659
Permission denied.

19:01.762 --> 19:05.881
You spent the last of
your money to come down here.

19:05.883 --> 19:10.335
That's not someone
who's throwing in the towel.

19:10.337 --> 19:12.054
That's someone

19:12.056 --> 19:15.725
who wants another chance.

19:18.779 --> 19:20.246
I don't know, Cruz.

19:20.248 --> 19:21.697
We could be here
another day or two.

19:21.699 --> 19:23.866
Why don't you send me
a secure contact number

19:23.868 --> 19:26.285
and I'll get back--
um...

19:26.287 --> 19:29.872
Ok, yeah. Well, you tell him
mommy misses him.

19:29.874 --> 19:31.741
Talk to you soon.

19:31.743 --> 19:33.159
What have you got,
Garcia?

19:33.161 --> 19:34.960
As your gigantic brain
suspected, sir,

19:34.962 --> 19:36.545
a two-tone SUV
with Florida plates

19:36.547 --> 19:38.881
was parked across the street
from the apartment building.

19:38.883 --> 19:40.466
Were you able
to pull a plate?

19:40.468 --> 19:42.835
The SUV is registered
to a Clifford Walsh.

19:42.837 --> 19:45.020
Do you have an address?

19:45.022 --> 19:46.272
Nothing local.

19:46.274 --> 19:49.175
Walsh moved out of the area
a long time ago.

19:49.177 --> 19:51.177
Oh.

19:51.179 --> 19:53.229
And if you hate sad stories
as much as I do,

19:53.231 --> 19:55.898
you should leave the room
right now, 'cause this one's super sad.

19:55.900 --> 19:59.702
10 years ago Walsh lost
his wife and his 14-year-old son

19:59.704 --> 20:01.437
in a home invasion robbery.

20:01.439 --> 20:02.905
Here in Cleveland?

20:02.907 --> 20:05.291
Yeah. Uh, it looks like
the motive was stealing stuff.

20:05.293 --> 20:07.076
Jewelry has taken
out of the home,

20:07.078 --> 20:10.196
and there was an attempted
sexual assault on Mrs. Walsh.

20:10.198 --> 20:12.131
Where was Walsh at the time
of the home invasion?

20:12.133 --> 20:14.566
He was working as a night
supervisor

20:14.568 --> 20:18.003
of a tool and die plant in Strongville,
which is just outside the city.

20:18.005 --> 20:19.054
Did they get the killer?

20:19.056 --> 20:20.039
Yeah, very next day.

20:20.041 --> 20:22.208
Howard Clark,
18 years old.

20:22.210 --> 20:25.344
High as a kite on meth
at the time of the attack.

20:25.346 --> 20:27.563
He was only sentenced
to 10 years in prison.

20:27.565 --> 20:29.081
The meth angle
is interesting.

20:29.083 --> 20:32.268
Did Clark have any connection with the
victims in the apartment?

20:32.270 --> 20:35.855
Yeah. He was buddies
with Dane Hendrix, one of the victims.

20:35.857 --> 20:39.275
10 years. That's awfully lenient
for a double homicide.

20:39.277 --> 20:41.994
You think? Maybe that's
why Walsh went into a total tailspin.

20:41.996 --> 20:44.113
He started drinking,
quit his job, moved to Florida.

20:44.115 --> 20:47.416
He's been like borderline
homeless for many, many years.

20:47.418 --> 20:49.151
When did he
come back to Cleveland?

20:49.153 --> 20:51.520
Last week. He cashed out
his meager savings account

20:51.522 --> 20:53.105
and headed north.

20:53.107 --> 20:56.158
Here is what's interesting
about the timing of this, though.

20:56.160 --> 20:59.278
Howard Clark, the guy
who killed Walsh's wife and son,

20:59.280 --> 21:01.964
he was scheduled
to be released 3 months from now,

21:01.966 --> 21:04.550
but he was killed
in a random prison fight

21:04.552 --> 21:07.970
in the exercise yard
the day before Walsh left Florida.

21:07.972 --> 21:09.421
That must have been
the trigger-- Clark's death--

21:09.423 --> 21:10.539
that stirred up
all memories.

21:10.541 --> 21:12.892
And the memories
brought him back to Cleveland.

21:12.894 --> 21:15.561
But for what purpose?

21:27.541 --> 21:30.075
The man we're looking for
is Clifford Walsh.

21:30.077 --> 21:32.244
The photograph you have of him
was taken last year.

21:32.246 --> 21:34.663
Walsh's family died in a home invasion
robbery 10 years ago.

21:34.665 --> 21:37.249
The killer was a man
named Howard Clark.

21:37.251 --> 21:40.503
But Clark's recent death in prison
may have triggered Walsh's spree.

21:40.505 --> 21:43.255
The first 5 murders appear
to be opportunistic kills,

21:43.257 --> 21:45.958
but all the victims have criminal records
or a history of domestic violence.

21:45.960 --> 21:48.294
The shooting at the meth
apartment, however,

21:48.296 --> 21:50.379
was premeditated
and calculated.

21:50.381 --> 21:53.048
One of the victims
was Dane Hendrix,

21:53.050 --> 21:55.317
a friend of Howard Clark's
at the time of the invasion.

21:55.319 --> 21:56.936
Targeting Hendrix
means Walsh might now

21:56.938 --> 22:00.973
be trending towards
more mission-oriented behavior.

22:00.975 --> 22:03.692
Walsh has no concerns
about keeping his identity

22:03.694 --> 22:05.778
or movements secret.

22:09.232 --> 22:11.450
In some ways
his recklessness works in our favor.

22:11.452 --> 22:14.353
He's out in the open.
Here I am. Come and get me.

22:14.355 --> 22:16.071
But this is a man
who's lost his family

22:16.073 --> 22:17.856
and feels he has nothing
to lose.

22:17.858 --> 22:19.524
He doesn't care about
repercussions,

22:19.526 --> 22:22.378
which makes him the most
dangerous kind of spree killer.

22:22.380 --> 22:24.380
Time is of the essence.
Thank you.

22:24.382 --> 22:25.965
Agent Hotchner.

22:25.967 --> 22:28.217
We found Walsh's vehicle.

22:35.392 --> 22:37.042
"Forgive me, sweetheart.

22:37.044 --> 22:38.644
I tried to make it right."

22:38.646 --> 22:39.762
Suicide note?

22:39.764 --> 22:41.263
Walsh may have been
about to kill himself

22:41.265 --> 22:43.032
and saw the thugs
hassling the old man.

22:43.034 --> 22:44.767
But he killed them instead.
Well that makes sense.

22:44.769 --> 22:48.487
The line between suicidal
and homicidal ideation is pretty thin.

22:50.824 --> 22:52.157
Look at this.

22:52.159 --> 22:53.776
Is he counting
something down?

22:53.778 --> 22:59.031
The number sequence
starts at 3,553 and ends...

22:59.033 --> 23:01.216
at 87.

23:01.218 --> 23:03.752
Let's see, Clark was killed
on January 14th...

23:03.754 --> 23:07.089
87 days before his scheduled
release date of April 11th.

23:07.091 --> 23:09.458
Working backwards
and taking into account

23:09.460 --> 23:11.844
the 2009, 2012 leap years,
3,553 days...

23:14.081 --> 23:17.499
April 9, 2004, the exact day
Clark began his prison term.

23:17.501 --> 23:20.102
So Walsh was waiting
for Clark to be released

23:20.104 --> 23:21.420
to take revenge on him.

23:21.422 --> 23:24.256
And suddenly the object
of his vengeance was gone.

23:24.258 --> 23:26.225
But Walsh's need
for justice wasn't.

23:26.227 --> 23:28.093
His revenge has simply
found another outlet.

23:28.095 --> 23:30.095
We need to see if any cars
have been reported stolen

23:30.097 --> 23:31.563
in the area
in the last couple hours.

23:31.565 --> 23:33.932
If Walsh is swapping out vehicles,
it would be the first indication

23:33.934 --> 23:35.535
he's cared enough
to take evasive action.

23:35.536 --> 23:37.036
Something else
must be on the menu.

23:37.038 --> 23:41.440
Something important enough that
he can't risk being caught.

23:43.827 --> 23:46.445
We need to figure out
who's next on Walsh's list of targets.

23:46.447 --> 23:48.714
You know, Walsh lost
his wife and his child.

23:48.716 --> 23:50.299
He could be looking
to balance the books.

23:50.301 --> 23:52.001
Clark did get a light sentence.

23:52.003 --> 23:55.004
Walsh might have a grudge against
the judge or surviving jury members.

23:55.006 --> 23:56.839
We need to get those names,
as well as the defense attorney

23:56.841 --> 23:58.440
and anyone who testified
on Clark's behalf.

23:58.442 --> 23:59.791
The newspaper reports
at the time

23:59.793 --> 24:01.460
suggested Clark might have
had an accomplice.

24:01.462 --> 24:03.729
It was just a rumor,
but it was a persistent one.

24:03.731 --> 24:05.514
Maybe it was Dane Hendrix,
the meth dealer?

24:05.516 --> 24:07.683
No, he had a solid alibi
for the night of the home invasion.

24:07.685 --> 24:09.685
Clark always said
he acted alone, but still...

24:09.687 --> 24:12.604
We need to locate and get all of
these people into protective custody.

24:18.945 --> 24:21.647
This ain't gonna work, Dave.

24:21.649 --> 24:24.667
Wait here.

24:29.506 --> 24:31.123
Can I help you?

24:31.125 --> 24:32.124
Thomas Scott?

24:32.126 --> 24:33.342
Yes.

24:33.344 --> 24:35.127
My name is David Rossi.

24:35.129 --> 24:37.596
I'm a friend of your father's.

24:40.684 --> 24:42.167
Did he send you?

24:42.169 --> 24:44.103
No.

24:44.105 --> 24:46.838
All I'm asking is a few
minutes of your time.

24:46.840 --> 24:49.975
May I come in?

24:49.977 --> 24:51.944
Don't take this wrong,

24:51.946 --> 24:54.012
but we've got nothing
to talk about.

24:54.014 --> 24:55.280
Tommy...

24:57.517 --> 24:59.568
Please.

25:03.907 --> 25:06.241
Nothing in Walsh's
background

25:06.243 --> 25:07.876
hinted at this type
of psychotic break.

25:07.878 --> 25:09.861
Testimonials all
reported him

25:09.863 --> 25:11.880
as a solid, loving family man.

25:11.882 --> 25:13.415
He supported his wife
while she went through

25:13.417 --> 25:15.200
a brief bout of
depression.

25:15.202 --> 25:17.419
When his son
had problems at school,

25:17.421 --> 25:20.305
he took him to one of
those expanded horizon treks.

25:20.307 --> 25:22.925
You know, the second intruder
theory has some validity.

25:22.927 --> 25:24.059
How so?

25:24.061 --> 25:25.561
Because Walsh's wife
was athletic

25:25.563 --> 25:27.312
and his son played
junior varsity football.

25:27.314 --> 25:30.516
Meaning it might have been hard
for Clark to subdue them both.

25:30.518 --> 25:34.553
Especially if his faculties
were diminished by drugs at the time.

25:34.555 --> 25:36.355
And mother and son
were found

25:36.357 --> 25:38.524
at opposite sides
of the house.

25:39.725 --> 25:42.244
You're right, Hotch. Someone
might have been helping Clark.

26:11.191 --> 26:12.858
Mr. Hines?

26:12.860 --> 26:15.444
Yes. Can I help you
with something?

26:15.446 --> 26:17.412
You know who I am.

26:17.414 --> 26:19.431
No. Sorry.

26:19.433 --> 26:21.650
I know who you are.

26:21.652 --> 26:24.603
Look, I think you got
the wrong place--

26:26.055 --> 26:28.991
I've been waiting
a long time for this.

26:31.161 --> 26:34.213
Jeffrey?
What's happening?

26:34.215 --> 26:35.931
Aah!

27:09.582 --> 27:09.648
Jeffrey?
What's happening?

26:47.237 --> 26:49.489
The victim is Jeffrey Hines.

26:49.491 --> 26:51.390
He wasn't
on our target list.

26:51.392 --> 26:53.893
Does he have a connection
to Walsh or Clark?

26:53.895 --> 26:55.461
Well, Garcia can't find one.

26:55.463 --> 26:58.030
Hines and his wife moved to Cleveland
from Hawaii last month.

26:58.032 --> 26:59.715
What does his wife say?

26:59.717 --> 27:01.750
Walsh came to the door,
said something to her husband,

27:01.752 --> 27:03.252
and then he just opened fire.

27:03.254 --> 27:05.221
Something's off on this one.

27:05.223 --> 27:08.774
Maybe Hines has a past
she doesn't know about.

27:09.893 --> 27:12.061
Well, hopefully that's it.

27:12.063 --> 27:13.696
Why hopefully?

27:13.698 --> 27:14.947
Because if there's truly
no connection here,

27:14.949 --> 27:16.949
Walsh is devolving.

27:16.951 --> 27:18.951
He's killing random people.

27:25.325 --> 27:28.327
I know he put his life
on the line for his country.

27:28.329 --> 27:30.079
I admire and I respect
him for that.

27:30.081 --> 27:31.631
Unsung heroes.

27:31.633 --> 27:36.135
A lot of good men
come back from combat damaged.

27:36.137 --> 27:38.237
They deserve another chance.

27:38.239 --> 27:40.256
Another chance.

27:41.675 --> 27:43.643
Mr. Rossi, when I was
12 years old,

27:43.645 --> 27:47.563
my father told me
he was never going to drink again.

27:47.565 --> 27:50.733
For the umpteenth time.

27:50.735 --> 27:52.635
And I believed him.

27:52.637 --> 27:54.520
I was a kid.

27:55.689 --> 27:57.924
Then one day he takes
me and 3 of my friends

27:57.926 --> 28:00.042
to Dodger stadium.

28:00.044 --> 28:02.361
I can still remember
the exact moment

28:02.363 --> 28:05.498
the vendor put that
first beer in his hand.

28:05.500 --> 28:09.335
Second inning,
Mickey Hatcher at the plate.

28:09.337 --> 28:12.455
One ball, two strikes.

28:12.457 --> 28:15.791
I saw that beer and
I knew what was coming.

28:15.793 --> 28:18.160
My father got so drunk,
my friends' parents

28:18.162 --> 28:20.746
had to come pick us up
and take us home.

28:20.748 --> 28:23.182
Take me home.

28:25.135 --> 28:26.936
I'm really sorry, Thomas.

28:26.938 --> 28:30.506
I could tell you 10 more stories
just like that one.

28:30.508 --> 28:33.342
This program
my father's in,

28:33.344 --> 28:34.977
hopefully
it makes him better,

28:34.979 --> 28:38.013
but my son is not going through
the same humiliation

28:38.015 --> 28:40.182
and disappointment
that I did.

28:42.819 --> 28:47.523
I don't hate my father,
Mr. Rossi.

28:47.525 --> 28:50.025
I don't not care
about him.

28:50.027 --> 28:52.328
I love him.

28:54.197 --> 28:57.083
But I've got to
protect my family.

29:00.003 --> 29:03.005
That's my priority.

29:04.257 --> 29:07.310
All I ask
is that you don't take

29:07.312 --> 29:11.030
the possibility of
forgiveness off the table.

29:11.032 --> 29:13.816
Not yet.

29:13.818 --> 29:16.702
Can I get you
some more tea, Mr. Rossi?

29:16.704 --> 29:18.020
No, thank you, ma'am.

29:18.022 --> 29:20.823
I--I really should be going.

29:23.360 --> 29:25.661
He's outside, isn't he?

29:27.364 --> 29:28.948
He's in the car.

29:28.950 --> 29:32.601
I wish it were possible,
Mr. Rossi, but it isn't.

29:32.603 --> 29:36.038
I've worked too hard to build
a good home for me and my family.

29:39.092 --> 29:42.511
People can't build
without tools.

29:42.513 --> 29:45.431
And tools are passed
down to us from others.

29:45.433 --> 29:49.568
When you take in the life
you've built, Thomas,

29:49.570 --> 29:52.304
and watch the life
your son will build

29:52.306 --> 29:55.224
for his own family...

29:55.226 --> 29:57.777
Remember that.

30:36.600 --> 30:39.185
I knew I was crazy
to hope.

30:40.270 --> 30:41.971
I'm sorry, Harrison.

30:41.973 --> 30:44.523
So I guess
that's it, then.

30:45.742 --> 30:48.778
Your son's a fine young man.
You should be proud.

30:48.780 --> 30:50.579
I am.

30:50.581 --> 30:54.900
I just wish I could
tell him that to his face.

30:58.872 --> 31:00.656
What now?

31:00.658 --> 31:02.258
You tell me.

31:02.260 --> 31:04.093
I could take you back
to the motel

31:04.095 --> 31:05.544
and leave you
with your vodka.

31:05.546 --> 31:09.381
Or, if I ignore every
speed limit sign

31:09.383 --> 31:12.218
between here and Santa Monica,
I could get you back

31:12.220 --> 31:15.221
to New Directions
just under the wire.

31:15.223 --> 31:18.057
Look, Harrison,

31:18.059 --> 31:22.027
it took a long time
to get to this point with your son.

31:22.029 --> 31:25.965
It's not gonna fix itself
overnight.

31:44.335 --> 31:46.001
And on the international front,

31:46.003 --> 31:48.387
60 people, mostly
women and children,

31:48.389 --> 31:50.923
are believed dead
in a suicide bombing.

31:50.925 --> 31:52.207
Authorities--

31:52.209 --> 31:53.876
Enough of that
depressing stuff.

31:53.878 --> 31:56.211
It's happy hour,
for crying out loud.

31:56.213 --> 31:57.480
Things won't change.

31:57.482 --> 32:00.149
Excuse me?

32:00.151 --> 32:01.567
The world.

32:01.569 --> 32:04.870
There aren't enough bullets
to make things right.

32:07.440 --> 32:10.276
You got that thing figured out with
your neighbor yet?

32:10.278 --> 32:12.361
Ah, jeez,
the doggie-doo wars.

32:12.363 --> 32:15.030
I told you, that kid
will never pick up after his mutt

32:15.032 --> 32:16.615
when he goes on my lawn,
right?

32:16.617 --> 32:17.583
Yeah.

32:17.585 --> 32:19.201
But yesterday,
it really hits me.

32:19.203 --> 32:20.736
I'm going about this
all wrong.

32:20.738 --> 32:22.338
It's not the kid's fault,

32:22.340 --> 32:24.573
it's the parents' fault.
They never taught him any better.

32:24.575 --> 32:26.074
Did you go talk to them?

32:26.076 --> 32:27.426
I did better than that.

32:27.428 --> 32:29.678
Last night,
I scooped up the dog poop,

32:29.680 --> 32:31.347
walked next door,
I set it right down

32:31.349 --> 32:32.848
on mom and dad's
welcome mat.

32:32.850 --> 32:34.850
Mi caca es su caca.

32:34.852 --> 32:36.135
That's great.

32:36.137 --> 32:37.553
Take the problem
to the doorstep.

32:37.555 --> 32:39.054
Go to the source.

32:50.033 --> 32:51.400
This is strange.

32:51.402 --> 32:53.736
The M.E. reports
from the home invasion.

32:53.738 --> 32:55.237
Teddy Walsh's wrists
were tightly bound,

32:55.239 --> 32:56.539
but there were no
subdermal hematomas

32:56.541 --> 32:57.790
around the deep
ligature marks.

32:57.792 --> 32:59.575
What do you see here?

33:03.279 --> 33:04.997
Someone clinging
to memories.

33:04.999 --> 33:06.715
It's basically a shrine
to his wife.

33:06.717 --> 33:07.755
More importantly,
what don't you see here?

33:07.780 --> 33:08.969
His son.
Exactly.

33:08.970 --> 33:10.619
There's not a single
photograph

33:10.621 --> 33:12.004
or shred of memorabilia
about him.

33:12.006 --> 33:14.857
And the suicide note
was addressed only to his wife.

33:14.859 --> 33:16.786
Garcia, you said Teddy Walsh had
gotten into some trouble at school, yes?

33:16.787 --> 33:17.913
Yeah. Nothing serious.

33:17.938 --> 33:19.818
He stole a video game
from another kid's locker.

33:20.081 --> 33:22.231
And that's why Walsh took his son
on the Expanded Horizons hike?

33:22.233 --> 33:23.432
Uh-huh, that's right.

33:23.434 --> 33:25.467
And Expanded Horizons takes
people out in groups, yes?

33:25.469 --> 33:26.769
Yes, sir.

33:26.771 --> 33:28.187
Ok, can you find out
the names

33:28.189 --> 33:29.955
of the other participants
on that specific trek?

33:29.957 --> 33:31.490
Let me see...

33:34.411 --> 33:36.795
Oh. Lordy, lordy.

33:36.797 --> 33:39.698
Howard Clark and father.

33:39.700 --> 33:42.150
Walsh and Clark were
on that hike together.

33:45.205 --> 33:48.090
I think we just found
Clark's accomplice.

33:48.092 --> 33:51.293
Walsh's own son.

34:09.813 --> 34:12.164
We haven't found the connection
with the jogger yet,

34:12.166 --> 34:13.400
but every victim of Walsh's

34:13.425 --> 34:15.184
has been associated
with criminal behavior.

34:15.185 --> 34:17.252
Only the guilty
deserve to die.

34:17.254 --> 34:19.989
Except today started
with Walsh ready to die himself.

34:19.991 --> 34:21.206
He wrote a suicide note.

34:21.208 --> 34:22.690
Because he was guilty, too.

34:22.693 --> 34:24.359
His own son was complicit
in the death of his wife.

34:24.360 --> 34:26.194
Garcia.
Talk to me.

34:26.196 --> 34:27.980
Are Howard Clark's parents
still in the Cleveland area?

34:27.982 --> 34:30.349
Uh, father died 5 years ago,
heart attack.

34:30.351 --> 34:33.284
Mother--yep, Helen Clark.
Sending her address now.

34:33.286 --> 34:35.971
You said earlier that Walsh might want
to balance the books.

34:35.973 --> 34:38.324
There'd only be one person
to provide that kind of payback.

34:38.326 --> 34:39.675
Another parent.

34:48.851 --> 34:50.202
Mrs. Clark.

34:50.204 --> 34:53.072
You know who I am,
don't you?

34:53.074 --> 34:55.139
Yes.

34:55.141 --> 34:58.243
Then you know why I'm here.

35:00.580 --> 35:02.998
Am I going to die tonight?

35:05.869 --> 35:09.038
Yes, ma'am.

35:09.040 --> 35:11.239
I'm afraid you are.

35:26.331 --> 35:28.217
Howard Clark's mother
won't answer.

35:28.218 --> 35:29.718
The two boys probably
hatched the plan

35:29.720 --> 35:31.102
when they met
on the hiking trip.

35:31.104 --> 35:32.604
Teddy knew where his mother
kept the jewels

35:32.606 --> 35:33.972
and when his father
would be gone.

35:33.974 --> 35:36.057
Except Clark shows up
high on meth,

35:36.059 --> 35:38.026
tries to rape the mother,
Teddy fights back

35:38.028 --> 35:39.611
and Clark kills
the both of them.

35:39.613 --> 35:41.813
And that explains the lack
of subdermal hematomas on Teddy's wrists.

35:41.815 --> 35:44.699
He was killed first
and then tied up.

35:44.701 --> 35:46.568
Jeffrey Hines,
the jogger who got shot,

35:46.570 --> 35:48.036
Garcia found a connection.

35:48.038 --> 35:51.089
It's not who he was,
it's where he was.

35:52.708 --> 35:56.878
Your son doesn't look like
much of a killer there.

35:58.381 --> 36:00.765
Neither did my son, though.

36:02.435 --> 36:05.003
What are you talking about?

36:05.005 --> 36:08.924
My son Teddy was in on it.

36:08.926 --> 36:10.725
Not the killing part.

36:10.727 --> 36:12.978
But he made it happen.

36:14.931 --> 36:17.482
I got a picture, too.

36:21.237 --> 36:23.939
This is my wife, Emma.

36:23.941 --> 36:26.107
Look at it.

36:32.415 --> 36:34.749
I'm so sorry.

36:34.751 --> 36:36.701
If I'd been a better dad,

36:36.703 --> 36:38.787
and you'd been
a better mom...

36:38.789 --> 36:40.321
Ohh...

36:44.710 --> 36:46.995
It's too late for
what-ifs.

36:46.997 --> 36:49.764
We can't blame ourselves
for what happened that night.

36:49.766 --> 36:51.833
No?

36:51.835 --> 36:53.351
I watched you
in the courtroom

36:53.353 --> 36:55.854
when you testified
for your son,

36:55.856 --> 36:58.840
defending the murder
of my family?

36:58.842 --> 37:01.693
I'm a mother.

37:01.695 --> 37:03.528
No matter what happens
in this world,

37:03.530 --> 37:06.848
a child has a right to know
there is somebody

37:06.850 --> 37:08.984
who will stand up for them.

37:08.986 --> 37:11.820
Even if they're
a cold-blooded killer?

37:11.822 --> 37:15.523
The drugs had taken over
my boy.

37:15.525 --> 37:17.242
I know my son.

37:17.244 --> 37:22.414
And what happened that evening,
that wasn't who he was.

37:22.416 --> 37:25.333
I thought I knew
my son, too.

37:25.335 --> 37:29.537
Emma tried to warn me
that he needed help.

37:30.806 --> 37:32.640
Small things...

37:35.044 --> 37:37.545
I didn't listen.

37:37.547 --> 37:39.230
Mrs. Clark,

37:39.232 --> 37:40.899
do you think
we're reunited

37:40.901 --> 37:43.034
with loved ones
after death?

37:45.220 --> 37:48.189
Yes, I do.

37:50.409 --> 37:52.694
I wish I did.

37:55.230 --> 37:56.698
I think...

37:56.700 --> 38:01.235
It's just a way
for the living to cope

38:01.237 --> 38:03.505
with loss.

38:09.845 --> 38:13.081
I guess we'll both find out
soon enough, won't we?

38:20.056 --> 38:21.923
Are you scared?

38:25.845 --> 38:29.114
I think about fear a lot.

38:29.116 --> 38:31.316
I try to imagine
what Emma must have felt

38:31.318 --> 38:32.901
In those final moments.

38:34.738 --> 38:36.571
Clifford Walsh, FBI.

38:36.573 --> 38:38.123
Put the weapon
on the table.

38:38.125 --> 38:39.657
No.

38:39.659 --> 38:41.543
Slowly lower it.

38:41.545 --> 38:43.211
Helen hasn't harmed anyone.

38:43.213 --> 38:44.412
She's innocent.

38:44.414 --> 38:46.548
Wrong. I don't hurt
the innocent.

38:46.550 --> 38:47.832
Wrong. You already have.

38:47.834 --> 38:49.834
Who? The thugs
in the park?

38:49.836 --> 38:51.653
The meth dealers?

38:51.655 --> 38:53.638
The guy that was
choking his wife?

38:53.640 --> 38:55.256
You're forgetting
about the jogger.

38:55.258 --> 38:57.342
Hines?

38:57.344 --> 38:59.344
Let me tell you
about him.

38:59.346 --> 39:01.679
When Hines went
to the D.A.'s office,

39:01.681 --> 39:04.015
Clark's father
used his influence

39:04.017 --> 39:05.617
to have evidence
suppressed.

39:05.619 --> 39:08.436
Evidence...

39:08.438 --> 39:11.439
That would have sent
my wife's killer to jail for life.

39:11.441 --> 39:14.029
The former employee at the
D.A.'s office was Morgan Hines.

39:14.030 --> 39:16.939
6 months ago he sold that
house to his brother Jeffrey.

39:17.280 --> 39:19.614
That was the man you killed.

39:19.616 --> 39:21.649
No.

39:21.651 --> 39:23.484
That was the place.
I checked.

39:23.486 --> 39:26.154
Jeffrey Hines was innocent,
Clifford, and you murdered him.

39:27.973 --> 39:30.842
He left behind a wife
and 3 kids.

39:39.668 --> 39:43.004
When I saw the sun
come up this morning,

39:43.006 --> 39:46.941
I knew it was gonna be
my last time.

39:46.943 --> 39:49.527
