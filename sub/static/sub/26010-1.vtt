<i>When we posted
our first video,</i>

00:10.108 --> 00:13.079
<i>we never thought
we would be here.</i>

00:15.381 --> 00:17.513
<i>We're just four kids
from Melbourne.</i>

00:17.515 --> 00:19.749
<i>We started doing pranks
to make ourselves laugh.</i>

00:19.751 --> 00:22.319
<i>Hey guys, we're the Janoskians,
and today we're doing...</i>

00:22.321 --> 00:24.388
<i>What's our video called?</i>

00:24.390 --> 00:26.824
<i>One view,
multiplied into millions,</i>

00:26.826 --> 00:30.196
<i>and the more views we got,
the more we pushed the limits.</i>

00:31.730 --> 00:36.599
<i>Then, came the music,
the shows, and fans everywhere.</i>

00:38.304 --> 00:40.870
<i>Why the hell do they
like us anyway?</i>

00:40.872 --> 00:42.674
<i>Because we're doing
what we love,</i>

00:44.877 --> 00:46.476
<i>and in it together.</i>

00:46.478 --> 00:48.644
<i>Brothers always.</i>

00:48.646 --> 00:53.183
<i>But as they say, you're only
as good as your last video.</i>

00:53.185 --> 00:55.652
Hey, guys,
we're the Janoskians!

00:58.189 --> 01:00.457
And this is another fail video.

01:02.360 --> 01:04.528
So, guys, what we're
about to perform today

01:04.530 --> 01:07.363
is one of the most dangerous
stunts that we have ever done

01:07.365 --> 01:09.266
across any of our channels.

01:09.268 --> 01:11.802
You guys ready?

01:11.804 --> 01:12.735
Let's do it.

01:12.737 --> 01:14.538
Whoa!

01:17.442 --> 01:19.475
Okay, you guys,
so, as you know,

01:19.477 --> 01:21.445
there's a jellyfish
in this tank,

01:21.447 --> 01:26.350
and we are gonna wrap it onto
Beau's face for 15 seconds.

01:26.352 --> 01:27.717
Are you all ready to see this?

01:27.719 --> 01:28.886
No!

01:28.888 --> 01:30.853
Oh, wow.

01:30.855 --> 01:32.255
- Oh, my God.
- Ready, Beau?

01:32.257 --> 01:33.525
No! No!

Guys, what should we do?

01:59.350 --> 02:02.355
- Guys, we need to pee on him!
- Piss on his face!

02:29.681 --> 02:31.881
- A million views in one day!
- What?

02:31.883 --> 02:34.650
- Check out the comments!
- Whoa!

02:34.652 --> 02:38.822
Your pee is way too yellow, you guys
definitely should drink more water.

02:38.824 --> 02:39.722
That's so true.

02:40.658 --> 02:42.525
Gold shower, na, na, na!

02:44.330 --> 02:46.429
It's so easy for you guys
to be excited,

02:46.431 --> 02:48.232
you guys weren't the ones
being pissed on.

02:48.234 --> 02:49.666
Seriously,
give me my computer back!

02:52.304 --> 02:54.504
Hey, Sophia!
What's up, sweetie pie?

02:54.506 --> 02:57.406
<i>What's up, sweetie pie?</i>

02:57.408 --> 03:01.678
<i>What's up is I am officially
the most humiliated girlfriend</i>

03:01.680 --> 03:04.548
<i>in the entire world, again!</i>

03:04.550 --> 03:09.389
- Hi, Sophia!
- <i>Beau, we need to talk, in private.</i>

03:17.895 --> 03:21.665
- What's up?
- <i>My roommate yanks me out of bed,</i>

03:21.667 --> 03:23.566
<i>tells me there's a new
video up of you</i>

03:23.568 --> 03:25.568
<i>and your idiot friends,
and I'm like,</i>

03:27.605 --> 03:30.840
<i>my grandmother's
90th birthday yesterday</i>

03:30.842 --> 03:32.576
<i>because he had to work!</i>

03:32.578 --> 03:35.411
<i>Then, she shoved
her phone in my face,</i>

03:35.413 --> 03:38.681
<i>and shows me this disgusting
video of your friends</i>

03:38.683 --> 03:42.452
<i>peeing on your face!</i>

03:42.454 --> 03:45.922
<i>Now everyone, including my own
grandmother, has seen this.</i>

03:45.924 --> 03:47.826
Your grandmother saw it?

03:48.894 --> 03:51.028
Did she think it was funny?

03:51.030 --> 03:53.929
<i>Are you serious?</i>

03:53.931 --> 03:56.933
<i>You really need to think
about what's best for you:</i>

03:56.935 --> 04:02.038
<i>Beau Brooks,
or the loser Janoskians?</i>

04:02.040 --> 04:04.073
You know what, Sophia,
I don't think he needs to listen

04:04.075 --> 04:07.610
to you anymore because
you my friend, you suck!

04:07.612 --> 04:09.346
- Seriously?
- What?

04:09.348 --> 04:11.847
<i>Oh, Jai, you think
you're such hot shit!</i>

04:11.849 --> 04:13.850
<i>You do realize
you're just a dick?</i>

04:13.852 --> 04:16.452
<i>Luke, your claim to fame
is that you win</i>

04:16.454 --> 04:17.887
<i>all of the stupid dares!</i>

04:17.889 --> 04:19.990
<i>Oh, my God,
such an achievement!</i>

04:19.992 --> 04:23.526
<i>You're an inspiration
to jack asses everywhere!</i>

04:23.528 --> 04:24.695
What did I do to you?

04:24.697 --> 04:26.596
<i>You exist.</i>

04:26.598 --> 04:29.598
- Hey, Sophia, what about me?
- <i>You're just an idiot!</i>

04:29.600 --> 04:31.603
<i>Beau! Beau!</i>

04:32.870 --> 04:35.538
<i>I really fell for those
green eyes of yours,</i>

04:35.540 --> 04:39.108
<i>but then you opened your mouth,
and your friends peed in it.</i>

04:39.110 --> 04:41.812
<i>I can't do this, it's over.</i>

04:41.814 --> 04:44.914
You're seriously gonna break up
with me over some stupid video?

04:44.916 --> 04:47.084
<i>Take care of yourself, Beau.</i>

04:47.086 --> 04:49.389
What, no, no! Sophia!

04:51.122 --> 04:53.022
Hey, now you got us
all to yourself.

04:53.024 --> 04:56.093
- What do you wanna do first?
- Aw, let's go to the bar.

04:56.095 --> 04:58.431
Let's go film a video.

05:01.899 --> 05:03.899
Don't be like that, come on.

05:03.901 --> 05:06.469
Beau, put a
smile on your doll.

05:06.471 --> 05:09.574
<i>♪ It's beyond nuts ♪</i>

05:10.475 --> 05:11.942
<i>♪ It's beyond nuts ♪</i>

05:11.944 --> 05:14.610
<i>It's been almost four days.</i>

05:14.612 --> 05:17.012
<i>Oh, my God, that's just sad.</i>

05:17.014 --> 05:20.082
<i>That's so sad.</i>

05:20.084 --> 05:22.118
<i>I've known Beau
my entire life,</i>

05:22.120 --> 05:24.521
<i>and I've never
seen him like this.</i>

05:24.523 --> 05:26.822
- <i>Stop!</i>
- <i>What a pussy.</i>

05:26.824 --> 05:29.062
<i>So, you see, the problem
with Beau is that,</i>

05:30.696 --> 05:33.766
<i>he always thinks that he needs
to be in a relationship.</i>

05:36.535 --> 05:39.435
<i>What are you doing!</i>

05:39.437 --> 05:41.774
<i>I just want the old
Beau back, to be honest.</i>

05:46.177 --> 05:48.380
<i>Yeah, baby!</i>

05:49.615 --> 05:51.947
<i>Hey, guys, it's Beau here.</i>

05:51.949 --> 05:55.485
<i>There comes a point in any
person's life</i>

05:55.487 --> 05:57.086
<i>when they look in the mirror,
and they ask themselves,</i>

05:57.088 --> 05:59.956
<i>are they truly happy?</i>

05:59.958 --> 06:01.658
<i>All great things
come to an end,</i>

06:01.660 --> 06:04.493
<i>and I'm sad to say that...</i>

06:04.495 --> 06:07.096
<i>I have to move on
from the Janoskians.</i>

06:07.098 --> 06:09.632
<i>Thank you guys for watching.</i>

06:09.634 --> 06:12.137
Man, what a bitch.

06:13.672 --> 06:16.106
We can't just sit here
and accept defeat.

06:16.108 --> 06:20.577
We need a backup plan.
We'll find a better Beau.

06:20.579 --> 06:23.816
You know what, we should find a
Beau with even greener eyes.

06:26.785 --> 06:28.521
What are you doing, Daniel?!

06:29.153 --> 06:31.587
Hey, what's up, boys?

06:31.589 --> 06:35.992
So, what we're pretty much
doing is we wanna replace Beau.

06:35.994 --> 06:40.433
So, first off, what do you truly
wanna get out of being a Jonaskian?

06:46.170 --> 06:48.103
Where are you from?

06:48.105 --> 06:49.639
- France?
- Frenchmen!

06:49.641 --> 06:52.509
Do you have any tattoos?
No tattoos.

06:52.511 --> 06:53.877
- Scars!
- We wanna see them scars.

06:53.879 --> 06:55.745
Yeah, we like scars.

06:55.747 --> 06:57.514
I see you have a high
pain tolerance.

06:57.516 --> 06:58.885
Can you play a comedy side?

07:01.052 --> 07:02.519
No?

07:02.521 --> 07:04.620
Yeah, like that, see...

07:04.622 --> 07:07.093
Pucker up like...

07:09.995 --> 07:13.128
We wanna test
your pain tolerance level,

07:13.130 --> 07:17.199
so we're gonna see how well
you can walk across these Legos.

07:17.201 --> 07:19.872
While you're saying the
first line of your script.

07:22.608 --> 07:24.240
All right, can you do it
with one fist in the air?

07:24.242 --> 07:26.512
Weren't you already a client?

07:29.814 --> 07:32.451
All right, very good, very good.

07:33.851 --> 07:36.151
Turn your head to the side.

07:36.153 --> 07:38.654
All right, now kiss me back.

07:38.656 --> 07:40.656
- Yeah, did he get it right?
- Perfect.

07:40.658 --> 07:42.291
- Yeah, it looks good.
- All right, awesome.

07:42.293 --> 07:44.563
- All right, cool.
- Can you count to three?

07:47.766 --> 07:49.231
Aw, dig it right in.

07:49.233 --> 07:51.000
Here's some oysters.

07:51.002 --> 07:52.202
Let's see what
you guys are made of.

07:52.204 --> 07:54.073
Beau would not back down.

07:55.240 --> 07:57.807
- That's a bit chewy.
- Aw, yeah!

07:57.809 --> 07:59.142
You gotta...

07:59.144 --> 08:01.547
That was a buffalo testicle.

08:04.048 --> 08:06.818
I think we'll definitely
be in touch with you.

08:07.886 --> 08:09.789
All right, see you boys!

08:11.956 --> 08:14.591
This one's perfect,
it looks exactly like a Dorito.

08:14.593 --> 08:17.860
<i>If you look at Beau's
face closely enough,</i>

08:17.862 --> 08:21.764
<i>you'll see it is indeed
shaped as a Dorito,</i>

08:21.766 --> 08:23.132
<i>like a perfect triangle.</i>

08:23.134 --> 08:24.767
Guys, I've gotta get to work,

08:24.769 --> 08:26.937
and I'm running so, so, late.

08:26.939 --> 08:29.272
Please tell me
you've seen my boxers.

08:29.274 --> 08:31.576
Come on, please,
I'm running late. Anyone.

08:34.278 --> 08:37.714
Daniel, stand up for a second.

08:37.716 --> 08:39.982
- No.
- Daniel, stand up!

08:39.985 --> 08:41.818
I'm running late, seriously.

08:41.820 --> 08:44.087
- What?
- Are you wearing my boxers?

08:44.089 --> 08:46.089
No! I'm just wearing
ball protection.

08:46.091 --> 08:47.656
Ooh!

08:47.658 --> 08:49.725
- All of them?
- Got ten, actually.

08:49.727 --> 08:52.228
Seriously, Daniel? Take 'em off!
I'm gonna be late!

08:52.230 --> 08:54.296
Oh, there's one!
There's two!

08:54.298 --> 08:55.765
Incoming!

08:58.636 --> 08:59.669
Show him dat ass!

09:00.605 --> 09:01.908
Take 'em off!

09:02.841 --> 09:04.610
Stop you little...

09:06.010 --> 09:07.710
You guys are so funny!

09:07.712 --> 09:10.180
- Smells like shit!
- Judas over here!

09:10.182 --> 09:11.714
You guys should
consider getting a job, too.

09:11.716 --> 09:13.248
I hope you get fired.

09:13.250 --> 09:15.587
Uh-oh, an unknown number?

09:17.990 --> 09:20.390
Uh, hello, who are you?

09:20.392 --> 09:22.224
<i>You don't know who I am?</i>

09:22.226 --> 09:23.693
Nope, no, I don't.

09:23.695 --> 09:25.161
<i>What planet you live on?</i>

09:25.163 --> 09:27.363
I'm from Earth, mate,
what about you?

09:27.365 --> 09:31.001
<i>What cave do you dwell in?
Everyone knows Barry Black.</i>

09:31.003 --> 09:32.669
- Cave?
- Don't, don't...

09:32.671 --> 09:34.804
You dummy,
you don't know Barry Black?

09:34.806 --> 09:36.339
- Black Entertainment!
- What are you doing!

09:36.341 --> 09:37.641
Black Airline, Black Records?

09:37.643 --> 09:39.309
This is an honor, man!

09:39.311 --> 09:40.377
Call him back!

09:40.379 --> 09:41.377
All right, it's ringing.

09:43.347 --> 09:46.081
Barry, man! Sorry, my friend
he's a bit stupid.

09:46.083 --> 09:48.384
We're big fans, bro,
this is an honor!

09:48.386 --> 09:49.953
<i>It's an honor to meet
you guys, too.</i>

09:49.955 --> 09:51.820
<i>I'm gonna cut to the chase.</i>

09:51.822 --> 09:54.791
<i>My daughter, Alison,
adores you, especially Beau.</i>

09:54.793 --> 09:58.027
Beau, yeah, yeah. He's a
cool guy, he's our brother.

09:58.029 --> 09:59.195
<i>Where is he?</i>

09:59.197 --> 10:00.997
I think he's up
in the bathroom.

10:00.999 --> 10:03.098
- It is nasty up there,
- Whew!

10:03.100 --> 10:06.435
<i>Anyway, my daughter Alison's
having a sweet 16 party,</i>

10:06.437 --> 10:09.039
<i>and I want you guys to
perform some of those stunts,</i>

10:09.041 --> 10:10.839
<i>like the ones you do
on the internet.</i>

10:10.841 --> 10:12.709
<i>You know that jump rope
trick you guys do?</i>

10:12.711 --> 10:15.377
- Yeah, man.
- <i>I like that shit.</i>

10:15.379 --> 10:17.113
Too easy, bro.

10:17.115 --> 10:18.848
<i>We moved from
the East Coast to LA,</i>

10:18.850 --> 10:20.749
<i>so she's having
a hard time adjusting.</i>

10:20.751 --> 10:22.218
<i>You know how that could be.</i>

10:22.220 --> 10:25.121
<i>So it better look real good,
or else.</i>

10:25.123 --> 10:26.690
<i>What do you say?</i>

10:26.692 --> 10:29.191
Yeah, man, 100 percent.
We're down.

10:29.193 --> 10:30.759
Yeah, I guess so.

10:30.761 --> 10:31.895
<i>I'm handing you over
right now</i>

10:31.897 --> 10:33.363
<i>to my assistant, Holly.</i>

10:33.365 --> 10:35.201
<i>She'll take care
of all the details.</i>

10:37.969 --> 10:41.838
<i>Hello! You guys have some friends in
LA that you can stay with, right?</i>

10:41.840 --> 10:44.239
We have mates everywhere,
we're so popular!

10:44.241 --> 10:46.376
<i>Great, so I won't be
booking you guys a hotel.</i>

10:46.378 --> 10:48.143
<i>Look out for an e-mail
that's coming in soon</i>

10:48.145 --> 10:50.079
<i>with all of your
flight information,</i>

10:50.081 --> 10:53.248
<i>and boys,
just a little word of wisdom,</i>

10:53.250 --> 10:55.785
<i>Barry Black
makes or breaks acts.</i>

10:55.787 --> 10:58.153
Okay, what is that
meant to mean?

10:58.155 --> 11:00.924
<i>The last guys that came and
performed here, they bombed,</i>

11:00.926 --> 11:02.825
<i>and then they never got another
gig in this town ever again.</i>

11:02.827 --> 11:04.326
<i>Or in their home town
for that matter.</i>

11:04.328 --> 11:05.728
<i>It was a huge embarrassment</i>

11:05.730 --> 11:07.063
<i>for everybody involved.</i>

11:07.065 --> 11:08.330
Um, okay Holly,

11:08.332 --> 11:09.965
I think we'll be just fine.

11:09.967 --> 11:11.834
<i>Well, then we will
see you soon.</i>

11:11.836 --> 11:13.802
<i>Safe travels. Ciao!</i>

11:13.804 --> 11:16.171
- Adios!
- Bye bye!

11:16.173 --> 11:18.307
We're gonna need Beau back.

11:20.211 --> 11:23.448
Janoskians.

11:29.520 --> 11:30.855
Ew!

11:34.793 --> 11:38.161
Always have to open that big,
fat mouth of yours, then.

11:38.163 --> 11:41.464
Mate, we could've been staying
at The Four Seasons, or The W,

11:41.466 --> 11:44.032
somewhere fancy, but no!

11:44.034 --> 11:46.201
Yeah, okay, Jai,
in your dreams.

11:46.203 --> 11:50.039
- And why are you packing your warmest clothes?
- We're going up North.

11:50.041 --> 11:52.876
Right, California,
it's pretty much a desert, bro.

11:52.878 --> 11:56.215
- It's always hot there.
- Shit!

11:57.249 --> 11:59.348
Guys, I got us
a spot to crash.

11:59.350 --> 12:01.785
- No way!
- Yep, I just sent a tweet out on Twitter

12:01.787 --> 12:03.786
asking if anyone
has a spare house,

12:03.788 --> 12:05.821
and this guy named Cody replied,
and offered us his.

12:05.823 --> 12:07.956
- This is the house?
- Yup!

12:07.958 --> 12:09.559
Oh! That's a palace!

12:09.561 --> 12:12.528
- Check it out!
- That is sick!

12:12.530 --> 12:14.497
How is this guy, Cody?

12:14.499 --> 12:15.799
No idea.

12:15.801 --> 12:17.065
I just DM'ed him our number

12:17.067 --> 12:18.971
Oh, that's smart.

12:21.539 --> 12:23.105
Oh, this is him. Guys.

12:23.107 --> 12:24.375
Be nice.

12:26.311 --> 12:28.578
<i>Holy shit!
This is really your number!</i>

12:28.580 --> 12:32.181
<i>I can't believe you guys
actually DM'ed me your number!</i>

12:32.183 --> 12:33.916
<i>I could be a psychopath!</i>

12:33.918 --> 12:36.018
<i>I'm not though!</i>

12:36.020 --> 12:37.853
<i>So you guys need
a place to crash, huh?</i>

12:37.855 --> 12:39.155
I really hope we're not
intruding though.

12:39.157 --> 12:40.355
<i>Would you shut up?</i>

12:40.357 --> 12:42.224
<i>Shut up right now, shut up.</i>

12:42.226 --> 12:44.160
<i>No, man, it'd be an
honor to have you guys!</i>

12:44.162 --> 12:46.496
<i>Oh, my God, I got a dope crib,
plenty a room.</i>

12:46.498 --> 12:49.464
<i>You wanna come to LA, I'm the guy
you wanna be with, all right?</i>

12:49.466 --> 12:52.868
<i>I got LA on lockdown, okay? I got
VIP service at all the clubs,</i>

12:52.870 --> 12:55.374
<i>I got chicks on standby,
bottle service!</i>

12:57.308 --> 12:59.608
<i>Hey, listen, here. That's the
address to my place, all right?</i>

12:59.610 --> 13:02.411
<i>Well, our place.</i>
Me casa, su casa, <i>fellas.</i>

13:02.413 --> 13:03.915
<i>Hey, where's Beau?</i>

13:06.585 --> 13:07.983
Let's just get him fired,

13:07.985 --> 13:09.319
that way he has to come to LA.

13:09.321 --> 13:12.254
Order up!

13:12.256 --> 13:14.991
So, what I actually
didn't tell you was,

13:14.993 --> 13:17.627
I'll give you a 20 percent
discount back on the $10 drink,

13:17.629 --> 13:22.232
so I'll actually pay you
$2.73 to drink our drinks.

13:22.234 --> 13:23.802
What do you think?

13:26.638 --> 13:28.972
Beau, how could you!

13:28.974 --> 13:30.940
What the
did you put in there?

13:30.942 --> 13:33.443
What kind of company
are you guys running here?

13:33.445 --> 13:36.378
This is just my brother, he's just playing a joke.

13:36.380 --> 13:39.047
Did you have a shake, man?
Did you have one?

13:41.318 --> 13:45.153
- Stop!
- This place is under quarantine!

13:45.155 --> 13:48.358
- What are you doing!
- Do not move, we are looking for patient zero.

13:48.360 --> 13:51.026
Daniel, Daniel, it's a
clear mask, I can see you.

13:51.028 --> 13:53.629
I don't know you,
and nobody can leave okay?

13:53.631 --> 13:55.531
Nobody leaves! Nobody leaves!

14:00.437 --> 14:02.341
Get patient zero out!

14:06.344 --> 14:09.478
Hey, guys, how you guys doing,
you looking for a couch?

14:09.480 --> 14:11.147
Well, I'm Beau.

14:11.149 --> 14:13.181
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, man.

14:13.183 --> 14:15.118
So, the good thing
about these couches,

14:15.120 --> 14:16.652
I'm just gonna do
my pitch right now,

14:16.654 --> 14:18.655
is that they're
all made out of microfiber,

14:18.657 --> 14:21.590
so if you get any spills,
or anything on them,

14:21.592 --> 14:23.493
they easily come off
with a shampoo,

14:23.495 --> 14:25.661
you could pee on it,
and it'll come off.

14:25.663 --> 14:28.196
This one is actually great,
if you wanna take a seat.

14:28.198 --> 14:31.133
And it comes with the leg rest.

14:31.135 --> 14:33.038
Sit down and just relax, and...

14:34.371 --> 14:36.071
Yeah, we've got them
all in different colors,

14:36.073 --> 14:39.911
we can get in purple,
orange, magenta, red.

14:43.114 --> 14:46.549
Tony, can we get this in a
stone color, just like that?

14:46.551 --> 14:49.218
This couch right here?
We can? Yup.

14:49.220 --> 14:51.219
Perfect, you guys
just relax and enjoy.

14:51.221 --> 14:53.292
This is my personal favorite.

14:58.263 --> 14:59.632
My neck!

15:00.365 --> 15:03.235
Oh, my neck!

15:04.269 --> 15:06.337
Oh, my neck.

15:08.740 --> 15:12.110
Um, Tony, Tony, is it, is it...

15:13.644 --> 15:17.546
No, no, it's okay, the couch...
the couch is built for that,

15:17.548 --> 15:20.483
it's actually one
of our joy rides.

15:28.225 --> 15:30.129
You're gonna get me fired!

15:32.163 --> 15:34.196
What if I actually
broke my neck!

15:34.198 --> 15:35.598
You know that got my neck!

15:35.600 --> 15:37.369
- Shoot!
- Shoot!

15:40.138 --> 15:41.371
What?!

15:41.373 --> 15:42.704
- Move!
- Get out of the way!

15:42.706 --> 15:45.108
- Why?!
- Get out of the way!

15:45.110 --> 15:47.413
Okay, yeah,
you're gonna ignore me now?

15:48.746 --> 15:50.046
Just put it down.

15:50.048 --> 15:53.049
Beau, we've been
invited to LA.

15:53.051 --> 15:56.486
Barry Black invited us
to his daughter's sweet 16!

15:56.488 --> 16:00.055
So, we're gonna go to LA
to see the Barry Black?

16:00.057 --> 16:01.757
That's a good one, guys!
Really good!

16:01.759 --> 16:04.594
- I'm impressed actually.
- We're leaving tomorrow.

16:04.596 --> 16:06.661
- Tomorrow?
- And you're coming.

16:06.663 --> 16:10.400
Really, guys? I'm unemployed
cause of you dicks!

16:10.402 --> 16:12.734
You guys went and stuffed it
all up for me, you know what?

16:12.736 --> 16:16.238
Maybe if you went to LA, I'd be able
to actually move on with my life.

16:16.240 --> 16:18.711
So, yeah, guys, do me a favor,
and just go!

16:20.144 --> 16:23.179
Fine, Beau.
Bye-bye plane ticket.

16:23.181 --> 16:25.214
No, don't do it, don't do it!

16:29.520 --> 16:31.286
You are such an idiot.

16:31.288 --> 16:34.089
Daniel, wouldn't that
plane ticket be online?

16:34.091 --> 16:35.760
No, no, no,
I printed that one out.

16:38.062 --> 16:40.432
- Cool.
- Listen, Beau.

16:41.399 --> 16:44.132
I'm really sorry about Sophia.

16:44.134 --> 16:48.537
I really am, but you need this.
We need this.

16:48.539 --> 16:51.741
Come on, man, come!
It's LA, bro, come on!

16:51.743 --> 16:53.675
Jai actually has
a point for once.

16:53.677 --> 16:55.713
Come on, man, what do you say?

16:57.182 --> 16:58.748
Together.

16:58.750 --> 17:01.584
Mmm, I think he's into it!

17:03.288 --> 17:07.526
LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, LA!

17:13.565 --> 17:15.430
<i>♪ We got more bounce
in California ♪</i>

17:15.432 --> 17:17.499
<i>♪ Than all y'all combined ♪</i>

17:17.501 --> 17:19.568

17:19.569 --> 17:21.470
<i>♪ We like to party
all the time ♪</i>

17:21.472 --> 17:23.138
<i>♪ We got more bounce
in California ♪</i>

17:23.141 --> 17:24.507
Boys, Cody's not gonna be home

17:24.509 --> 17:26.209
for a while, what should we do?

17:26.211 --> 17:28.113
We're in LA,
let's go mess around!

17:30.248 --> 17:31.881
Welcome to LA,
where are you guys from?

17:31.883 --> 17:34.749
- Australia!
- Oh, get outta here! Kiwis, huh?

17:34.751 --> 17:36.384
We're from Melbourne, man.

17:36.386 --> 17:38.421
That's actually New Zealand.

17:38.423 --> 17:41.490
- You should take us somewhere cool like...
- Venice Beach!

17:41.492 --> 17:43.593
Venice is pretty cool, guys,
I'm not gonna lie!

17:43.595 --> 17:46.895
You got the beach, you got the
sand, marijuana dispensaries,

17:46.897 --> 17:49.364
you can just walk in there,
make up an ailment,

17:49.366 --> 17:52.602
"Oh, I have insomnia!
Oh, I have back pain!

17:52.604 --> 17:56.208
Oh, I have herpes!"
It helps with that!

18:08.452 --> 18:10.452
We just came here
from Australia,

18:10.454 --> 18:12.555
and we wanna know if you wanna
be friends, or something.

18:12.557 --> 18:14.759
Aliens took all my reefer.

18:18.563 --> 18:20.466
Is this spot taken?

18:30.541 --> 18:33.875
- Yeah
- Yeah! Woo!

18:33.877 --> 18:35.710
Here, do you want
a bite of my eggplant?

18:35.712 --> 18:37.580
That sounds wrong,
I didn't mean it like that!

18:37.582 --> 18:39.382
Would anyone like some pasta?

18:39.384 --> 18:41.950
Here take it,
put it in your pocket.

18:41.952 --> 18:44.786
- Does someone want some cabbage?
- Salad time!

18:47.925 --> 18:49.595
Those guys are ripped!

18:55.432 --> 18:56.665
Go away! Go away!

19:13.684 --> 19:16.320
We're just trying to have lunch.

19:20.525 --> 19:22.490
You're not gonna find this
in any of the guide books okay?

19:22.492 --> 19:24.693
I'm gonna take you to Fairfax,
it's like a mix of like,

19:24.695 --> 19:29.765
cool, like, skater kids, and Hasidic
Jews, and hipsters, and like...

19:29.767 --> 19:30.865
I've never met a Jew before.

19:30.867 --> 19:32.602
Well it's... you...

19:32.604 --> 19:34.804
- No! Oh! No way!
- You're Jewish?

19:34.806 --> 19:36.771
- Go ahead, touch me!
- Oh, whoa!

19:36.773 --> 19:37.974
- Yeah.
- Whoa!

19:37.976 --> 19:39.609
Holy crap, yeah!

19:39.611 --> 19:40.879
Yeah, yeah!

19:58.997 --> 20:00.763
Faster, Luke. Go, faster.

20:00.765 --> 20:02.664
Come on!
Yes, we're beating you!

20:18.449 --> 20:19.882
It's like
a whole new world here!

20:19.884 --> 20:22.517
And the paparazzi, like,
they actually take photos

20:22.519 --> 20:25.821
- of people and stuff?
- Oh, they're, like, real aggressive.

20:39.037 --> 20:40.635
Hey! Hey!

21:10.367 --> 21:12.567
What's goin' on over there?
Who's that, huh?

21:12.569 --> 21:14.069
It goes down in the DM!

21:14.071 --> 21:16.471
What's going on
with sexy green over here?

21:16.473 --> 21:17.972
You don't wanna know, man.

21:17.974 --> 21:19.874
Beau, seriously,
you're in LA, come on.

21:19.876 --> 21:22.978
Hey, come on.
We're friends now.

21:22.980 --> 21:26.414
Well, not really, you still
have to pay me but, tell me,

21:26.416 --> 21:28.116
what's going on,
what's the deal?

21:28.118 --> 21:29.818
He doesn't wanna talk about it.

21:29.820 --> 21:31.687
He doesn't wanna talk about it?
Okay, you know what?

21:31.689 --> 21:33.456
I'm tired of seeing
his face like this,

21:33.458 --> 21:34.757
and we're gonna
meet some girls, let's go!

21:34.759 --> 21:36.792
Yeah!

21:43.835 --> 21:45.968
Are you a beaver,
cause dam!

21:45.970 --> 21:47.836
- Oh, my God, Jai.
- Whoo!

21:49.006 --> 21:50.139
Hey, my brother's single,

21:50.141 --> 21:51.707
he just broke up with his girl!

21:51.709 --> 21:53.575
- I'm so sorry.
- And he wants a beaver!

21:53.577 --> 21:56.746
Beau, next time we talk to
a girl, get right up in there.

21:56.748 --> 21:58.447
You guys are supposed
to come grab me.

21:58.449 --> 22:01.584
He needs to know,
what it is to hug another lady!

22:01.586 --> 22:06.455
Hey, excuse me. My brother has never
held hands with an American girl.

22:07.491 --> 22:08.990
At least hug him.

22:08.992 --> 22:11.459
See, there! He is very shy.

22:11.461 --> 22:14.430
- Thank you.
- Don't you think he's cute?

22:14.432 --> 22:15.698
Oh, thank you.

22:15.700 --> 22:17.400
Hey can we have
your number though?

22:24.674 --> 22:27.543
Hello, can I have a moment
of your time?

22:27.545 --> 22:29.812
Okay, now, my friend here,
he just got dumped,

22:29.814 --> 22:33.047
and we heard that American girls...

22:33.049 --> 22:36.620
And he's heart broken. Would you
date him, or would you consider...

22:37.954 --> 22:39.557
Oh, thank you so much!

22:40.525 --> 22:42.591
I love you hair!
It's so nice.

22:42.593 --> 22:44.593
And he's still missing
his peck on the cheek.

22:44.595 --> 22:45.861
A little peck!

22:45.863 --> 22:47.630
Come on, yeah!

22:47.632 --> 22:49.164
You gotta get over
your girlfriend, Beau, come on.

22:50.701 --> 22:52.738
High five, high five.

22:55.705 --> 22:56.805
We'll be here all night.

23:06.717 --> 23:07.986
What's that guy doing?

23:09.019 --> 23:09.919
Hello?

23:11.489 --> 23:12.720
Bro, I think
it's all right, man.

23:12.722 --> 23:14.824
You know, oh,
that's another LA thing.

23:14.826 --> 23:17.125
People get road rage here,
I don't, I center myself,

23:17.127 --> 23:20.696
I do yoga, breathing exer...
but that guys like, hello!

23:22.200 --> 23:24.632
- It's kind of...
- Don't worry about it.

23:24.634 --> 23:26.469
No, it's fine, it's fine,
I'm cool with it,

23:26.471 --> 23:28.237
but like hello, we gotta
get somewhere, we gotta get...

23:28.239 --> 23:31.739
Move! Move! Move!
You piece of shit!

23:31.741 --> 23:33.476
- Why aren't you moving!
- Dude!

23:36.480 --> 23:38.881
Are you being serious?

23:38.883 --> 23:40.583
Yeah, man. I'm trying to
get him outta the way for you!

23:40.585 --> 23:42.785
That guy... That guy
didn't even flip you off!

23:42.787 --> 23:45.854
- He stuck his thumb up to you!
- Put your hands on the steering wheel!

23:45.856 --> 23:48.190
Whoa, we're gonna give you one star, man.
That's uncool.

23:48.192 --> 23:49.859
Oh that was a thumb
he was giving me?

23:49.861 --> 23:51.630
- Yeah, that was a thumb!
- Yes!

23:51.962 --> 23:53.128
Oh!

24:02.138 --> 24:04.038
You guys are making
a big mistake all right?

24:04.040 --> 24:06.007
You're making a huge mistake!
This is my house, all right!

24:06.009 --> 24:07.242
I grew up in this house!

24:07.244 --> 24:08.643
I have a deed to this house!

24:08.645 --> 24:10.045
My parents left me this house!

24:10.047 --> 24:12.547
Okay, can I just ask you
a question please?

24:12.549 --> 24:15.918
Would Emilio Estevez be dragged off
to jail for not paying property tax?

24:15.920 --> 24:18.554
What about Johnny Depp, huh?
No! They wouldn't!

24:18.556 --> 24:20.588
And I grew up with
both those guys, okay?

24:20.590 --> 24:22.224
Why are you picking on me?

24:22.226 --> 24:24.226
Hey, fellas! How ya doin'?

24:24.228 --> 24:27.563
Guys, listen,
I'm so glad you're here,

24:27.565 --> 24:29.097
I have a little
bit of a situation.

24:29.099 --> 24:31.667
But I'm handling it,
and it's gonna be fine.

24:31.669 --> 24:33.869
Okay, hey, would you
just give me a minute!

24:35.605 --> 24:37.672
Okay, look, look,
let me get in the car myself.

24:37.674 --> 24:40.776
Give me the dignity of
getting in the car myself.

24:40.778 --> 24:43.211
Oh, my God, there's no...
There's no place to put your...

24:43.213 --> 24:45.080
Can I just... I don't even know
where to put my legs.

24:45.082 --> 24:47.682
Okay, would you please?
You're making a big mistake.

24:47.684 --> 24:49.919
Don't worry about it,
all right, we're good!

24:53.057 --> 24:55.658
What the hell just happened?

24:55.660 --> 24:58.259
Whoa! Take a look
at this place!

24:58.261 --> 25:00.728
Hey, is this
house about to drop?

25:00.730 --> 25:02.730
I seriously think
it's about to fall over.

25:02.732 --> 25:04.299
It needs a little paint job,
don't you think?

25:04.301 --> 25:06.802
A little?

25:06.804 --> 25:09.671
Well, let's make
ourselves at home.

25:09.673 --> 25:10.706
Shotty first room!

25:12.643 --> 25:14.645
Whoo!

26:00.891 --> 26:02.594
Hello?

26:03.693 --> 26:05.230
Anybody here?

26:15.839 --> 26:17.608
What the...

26:18.108 --> 26:19.944
What the hell?

26:21.244 --> 26:22.746
What is this?

26:50.708 --> 26:51.940
What are you doing?!

26:51.942 --> 26:53.374
What are you doing?!
I live here!

26:53.376 --> 26:56.311
- I'm taking a piss!
- I'm taking a shower!

27:00.050 --> 27:02.785
Guys, relax.

27:02.787 --> 27:04.952
All we have to do is call
Barry Black's assistant,

27:04.954 --> 27:06.755
and tell her we need
a place to stay.

27:06.757 --> 27:08.157
She's not picking up, like,

27:08.159 --> 27:09.691
we gotta get outta here, guys!

27:09.693 --> 27:11.325
- We gotta get out!
- Daniel!

27:11.327 --> 27:13.461
Calm down, bro,
it's almost midnight.

27:13.463 --> 27:15.264
Of course she's
not gonna pick up.

27:15.266 --> 27:17.099
What the hell did
you see upstairs anyway?

27:17.101 --> 27:20.939
Just don't go up there.
This place has bad vibes.

27:27.711 --> 27:30.211
You guys are really cool.

27:30.213 --> 27:35.750
Real, and raw, not fake and phony,
like those other YouTubers.

27:35.752 --> 27:38.152
I've seen all your videos,
I love it!

27:38.154 --> 27:40.724
This one's my favorite one.

27:42.492 --> 27:44.826
Oh, yeah, that was pretty intense!

27:44.828 --> 27:48.363
Yeah, that one hurt, dude.
So, what's your favorite part?

27:48.365 --> 27:50.833
I didn't see it.

27:50.835 --> 27:53.869
Okay, so you are
friends with Cody?

27:53.871 --> 27:58.907
Oh, yeah. I know Cody, I met him
years ago at a casting office,

27:58.909 --> 28:01.346
it was for a movie called
<i>Barely Legal.</i>

28:03.446 --> 28:05.380
So, he told me to stay here,
fix up the house,

28:05.382 --> 28:07.048
that's what I've been doing.

28:07.050 --> 28:09.151
So what's your name, man?

28:09.153 --> 28:11.186
What's my name?

28:11.188 --> 28:13.221
Chuck.

28:13.223 --> 28:16.290
My nickname is
Shit Outta Luck Chuck,

28:16.292 --> 28:18.326
because everything I touch
turns to shit.

28:20.364 --> 28:22.831
Why are you laughing?

28:22.833 --> 28:24.533
Chuck, I'm sure it's not
as bad as it seems.

28:24.535 --> 28:28.303
There's people who have it
so much more worse.

28:28.305 --> 28:30.805
Hey, man! You shouldn't
FaceSwap before you go to sleep!

28:30.807 --> 28:33.808
You'll get nightmares,
everybody knows that!

28:33.810 --> 28:37.014
Not to mention you idiots
already have the same face.

28:39.250 --> 28:41.853
- Goodnight, Chuck.
- Goodnight, Chuck.

28:48.325 --> 28:50.057
What's your name again?

28:50.059 --> 28:52.463
Ah! Stop!

28:57.999 --> 29:00.334
Oh, hey, good morning, guys!
How'd you sleep?

29:00.336 --> 29:03.271
Man, I slept like shit!

29:03.273 --> 29:06.975
I swear, there was, like, this
bug biting me, like, all night!

29:12.148 --> 29:14.284
- What?
- Oh, nothing, you're good.

29:15.553 --> 29:17.084
Guys, Holly's not answering.

29:17.086 --> 29:18.586
I just wanna
get outta this house!

29:18.588 --> 29:20.421
Holly doesn't care for us, bro.

29:20.423 --> 29:23.225
Well, what are we supposed to do?
The party's in two days!

29:23.227 --> 29:25.928
Why don't we just go right to Barry's
house, and talk to him there?

29:25.930 --> 29:28.462
How hard could it be
to go to Barry Black's house?

29:28.464 --> 29:31.400
Are you being serious, like, you want us
to, like, hop like kangaroos to his house?

29:31.402 --> 29:32.467
How hard could it be?

29:32.469 --> 29:33.969
Seriously? Knock on the door.

29:33.971 --> 29:36.103
- Hey, Barry!
- Very attractive kids.

29:36.105 --> 29:38.507
- We're the Australians!
- Hey!

29:38.509 --> 29:40.875
How are we supposed to go
to Barry Black's house?

29:40.877 --> 29:43.411
Why don't you guys try
one of those celebrity tours?

29:43.413 --> 29:45.847
They might be able
to find where Barry lives.

29:45.849 --> 29:48.449
Duh! How simple is that?

29:48.451 --> 29:49.887
Chuck, smart man.

29:57.394 --> 30:00.228
Who's heard of
Sunset Boulevard?

30:00.230 --> 30:02.564
Sunset Boulevard...

30:02.566 --> 30:06.401
Sunset Boulevard is known for
its many eateries,

30:06.403 --> 30:10.305
a lot of its nightclubs,
but what I know it best as,

30:10.307 --> 30:16.277
is the location where Hugh Grant picked
up Divine Brown, a two-bit whore.

30:16.279 --> 30:18.145
Show of hands of someone

30:18.147 --> 30:21.283
who's probably been
in the same situation,

30:21.285 --> 30:24.652
but luckily did not get caught.

30:24.654 --> 30:27.256
Yeah, there's a couple of you,
understandable.

30:27.258 --> 30:30.659
Excuse me gentlemen, you have to sit down.

30:30.661 --> 30:34.563
- Where does Barry Black live!
- Everyone remain calm! Remain calm!

30:34.565 --> 30:36.899
Can I get a choo-choo!

30:36.901 --> 30:38.400
Choo-choo!

30:38.402 --> 30:41.003
Can I get an address
to Barry Black's place?

30:41.005 --> 30:42.403
Are they part of this, bro?

30:42.405 --> 30:43.505
Does anyone know where

30:43.507 --> 30:45.407
Barry Black lives by any chance?

30:45.409 --> 30:47.409
Hey, hey! We're trying
to do a freakin' tour here!

30:47.411 --> 30:49.478
You are not allowed
to have that microphone!

30:49.480 --> 30:52.046
- You are not an authorized tour guide!
- Y'all can't do this!

30:52.048 --> 30:53.649
What are y'all in a boy band,
or some shit?

30:53.651 --> 30:54.949
No, we're not a boy band,

30:54.951 --> 30:56.517
we're just really attractive.

30:56.519 --> 31:00.421
This isn't a joke,
we need Barry Black's address.

31:00.423 --> 31:03.025
Y'all can't do this shit,
we doin' a tour man!

31:07.431 --> 31:09.597
Barry, African American,

31:09.599 --> 31:12.066
he did not mean anything
by the Black...

31:19.242 --> 31:22.443
This has got to stop!
Not on my bus!

31:22.445 --> 31:23.946
Not on my bus!

31:23.948 --> 31:25.613
We just need to find
Barry Black!

31:25.615 --> 31:28.049
I know where he is!
All right.

31:28.051 --> 31:30.052
4573 Maple.

31:30.054 --> 31:31.620
- What?!
- Why didn't you say something?

31:31.622 --> 31:33.055
4573 Maple.

31:34.657 --> 31:38.125
Thank guys! Sorry about that,
sorry about that.

31:38.127 --> 31:41.265
Our next stop
will most likely be a bar.

31:47.037 --> 31:48.636
Barry, we made it, man!

31:48.638 --> 31:52.007
Oy, Barry! What's up?

31:52.009 --> 31:54.378
We came all the way from
Australia for you, man!

31:55.112 --> 31:56.581
Open up!

31:57.314 --> 31:59.448
- Barry!
- Barry!

31:59.450 --> 32:01.482
Barry!

32:01.484 --> 32:02.985
Why are you throwing rocks?

32:04.488 --> 32:06.321
Guys, I got an idea.

32:06.323 --> 32:08.023
Why don't we just
jump the fence?

32:08.025 --> 32:10.624
- You jump the fence.
- Okay, help me up.

32:10.626 --> 32:13.061
Oh, God, my hands up there.

32:13.063 --> 32:14.629
Ah, you're stretching me!

32:16.133 --> 32:17.501
Get up there, man!

32:18.234 --> 32:20.035
Goddammit!

32:20.037 --> 32:21.503
Guys, it's not Barry Black.

32:21.505 --> 32:24.006
Y'all think the Barry's
want to play? Huh?

32:25.742 --> 32:28.410
If you ball sacs are with
the real estate company,

32:28.412 --> 32:29.678
tell them I'm not selling!

32:29.680 --> 32:31.680
Yeah, you can sell these!

32:39.655 --> 32:43.091
That was the biggest guy I've ever
seen, he was holding a golf club!

32:43.093 --> 32:45.794
But they were the tightest shorts I've ever seen.

32:45.796 --> 32:47.696
He looked like a wrestler,
or something.

32:47.698 --> 32:50.431
Boys, why don't we go
straight to Holly's office?

32:50.433 --> 32:52.100
She sent me her address.

32:52.102 --> 32:55.069
Hey, it's in this
city called "downtown?"

32:55.071 --> 32:56.705
- Downtown?
- Yeah, downtown.

32:56.707 --> 32:58.239
All right, bro. Call her number.

32:58.241 --> 33:00.776
Hey, before man, we're broke.

33:00.778 --> 33:02.744
Look at the chimpanzee!

33:02.746 --> 33:05.046
Guys! Uber's here.

33:05.048 --> 33:07.615
I got front!

33:07.617 --> 33:10.387
- Why do you always get front?
- Because I do!

33:12.522 --> 33:14.655
Um, do you think
you guys will fit?

33:34.211 --> 33:36.812
Hi! It might be a little tight.

33:36.814 --> 33:40.782
Oh, are we...
am I scooching... okay.

33:40.784 --> 33:42.616
Yeah, sure.

33:44.520 --> 33:46.087
Have you got enough
room back there?

33:46.089 --> 33:47.421
Um, it's like a little tight,

33:47.423 --> 33:50.092
but I think it's fine.

33:50.094 --> 33:54.228
- I'm sorry.
- It's great to meet you all.

33:54.230 --> 33:57.332
I'm... I'm Beau...
by the way.

33:57.334 --> 34:00.071
Hi. I'm Casey.

34:11.514 --> 34:15.485
This is, uh...
definitely awkward.

34:17.353 --> 34:19.222
Yeah.

34:19.856 --> 34:22.389
So, where you headed?

34:22.391 --> 34:25.260
Um... I'm going to work.

34:25.262 --> 34:27.195
You guys?

34:27.197 --> 34:29.797
We're going to go see
Barry Black.

34:29.800 --> 34:32.666
He owns Black Records, Black
Entertainment, Black Airlines.

34:32.668 --> 34:35.670
It's his daughter's sweet 16,
so we're playing a gig.

34:35.672 --> 34:38.539
Got it, like one of those,
like, One Direction,

34:38.541 --> 34:40.809
- sort of like, boy bands, with like the hair.
- Oh, no.

34:40.811 --> 34:43.512
- Definitely not.
- Not... Not that.

34:43.514 --> 34:48.583
But, I'm sorry, it's just like
the skinny jeans, and the...

34:48.585 --> 34:51.219
We actually do pranks
and that type of thing.

34:51.221 --> 34:53.521
Oh! That's cool.

34:53.523 --> 34:57.559
You do pranks for, like...
for a living?

34:57.561 --> 35:00.262
Yeah, well, yeah, I guess
you can call it a job.

35:00.264 --> 35:02.164
We've been doing pranks
for about four years,

35:02.166 --> 35:03.798
and we haven't
looked back since.

35:03.800 --> 35:05.867
That's not true, you quit
the group a couple of days ago.

35:05.869 --> 35:08.369
Shh!

35:08.371 --> 35:11.606
So what was the last crazy prank
that you guys did?

35:11.608 --> 35:16.378
Well, we actually got this
huge jellyfish, and I put it on my face.

35:16.380 --> 35:19.213
And then we all had to pee on
him, and the internet called it,

35:19.215 --> 35:21.451
"The Shower from Down Under."

35:23.253 --> 35:24.619
Ow!

35:24.621 --> 35:26.688
Oh, my God!

35:26.690 --> 35:29.860
That is where
I recognize you from.

35:33.764 --> 35:38.266
That video was so funny!

35:38.268 --> 35:41.235
- I sent it to all of my friends.
- Are you being serious?

35:41.237 --> 35:43.338
Yeah, no, I thought
it was hilarious.

35:43.340 --> 35:46.273
I mean, it was gross, it made
me, like, laugh and cringe,

35:46.275 --> 35:47.708
all at the same time.

35:47.710 --> 35:51.412
It's a very unique talent
you guys have.

35:51.414 --> 35:53.248
If you get close enough
to Beau's face,

35:53.250 --> 35:55.217
you can smell the piss.

35:56.586 --> 35:58.954
Mmm. He actually
smells pretty good.

35:58.956 --> 36:01.722
Much better than you.

36:01.724 --> 36:04.858
Actually this is my stop
right here. A little bit, ready?

36:04.860 --> 36:05.927
Oh! Oh.

36:05.929 --> 36:07.498
Sorry, sorry about that.

36:18.675 --> 36:19.574
Hello!

36:19.576 --> 36:20.874
- Hi.
- Hi.

36:20.876 --> 36:22.443
I was just thinking,
you should totally

36:22.445 --> 36:23.577
come to this party.

36:23.579 --> 36:25.447
- Seriously?
- Yes.

36:25.449 --> 36:28.782
Be a part of scarring
some poor 16-year-old for life.

36:28.784 --> 36:30.721
Hmm, it's tempting.

36:32.255 --> 36:34.588
- Um.
- I mean, you pretty much

36:34.590 --> 36:36.423
were on top of me
the whole time.

36:36.425 --> 36:37.825
Oh, my God.

36:37.827 --> 36:40.797
Um, well, I guess that's true.

36:41.931 --> 36:43.731
Okay, I'll tell you what,

36:43.733 --> 36:46.601
if I can bring a friend,
I might stop by.

36:46.603 --> 36:50.472
- Bring all of them!
- Got it.

36:50.474 --> 36:54.412
So, do you think maybe
I could give you my number?

36:54.777 --> 36:56.446
Sure.

37:05.688 --> 37:07.424
Now I have yours.

37:07.958 --> 37:09.226
Clever.

37:10.460 --> 37:14.561
- I guess... you'll...
- I'll text you.

37:14.563 --> 37:17.699
Okay. Bye, Beau.

37:17.701 --> 37:19.633
- Text me.
- I will!

37:19.635 --> 37:20.670
He's back!

37:28.811 --> 37:31.748
Excuse me?
We're looking for Holly?

37:33.684 --> 37:34.986
Holly?

37:46.963 --> 37:48.666
Hello?

37:54.338 --> 37:55.539
I'm hungry.

37:56.639 --> 37:58.673
Yeah, me too.

37:58.675 --> 38:01.445
Should we go to the... kitchen?

38:12.422 --> 38:15.824
This is my favorite thing,
check it out!

38:15.826 --> 38:17.691
Look how big these freaking...
are!

38:17.693 --> 38:19.094
You can't find them
this big in Melbourne.

38:19.096 --> 38:20.662
Oh, my God!

38:20.664 --> 38:22.630
They've got wrapped candy!

38:22.632 --> 38:24.632
In a jar!

38:24.634 --> 38:27.735
Think Upper East Side
gallery opening.

38:27.737 --> 38:30.771
Yes! Make it work.

38:33.376 --> 38:34.976
Is this where you guys
keep your snacks?

38:34.978 --> 38:37.811
- On the floor?
- Holly, right?

38:37.813 --> 38:41.715
Yeah, and you guys
are The Janos... Jano...

38:41.717 --> 38:43.550
Janoskins... Janoskeens.

38:43.552 --> 38:46.086
- Janoskians.
- Don't "Jano" who we are?

38:46.088 --> 38:48.555
- Get it? Ja know?
- Yes, that's cute.

38:48.557 --> 38:50.492
Holly, why have you been
ignoring my calls?

38:50.494 --> 38:53.161
I haven't been ignoring you,
I got all ten of you voicemails,

38:53.163 --> 38:56.130
and your 50 text messages, but I've been
a little bit busy planning this party.

38:56.132 --> 38:58.833
I'm sure,
I mean, it's Barry Black!

38:58.835 --> 39:01.403
Hey, we just wanted to
run a few ideas by you.

39:01.405 --> 39:02.704
Okay,
I'm gonna stop you there.

39:02.706 --> 39:04.539
I'm gonna shoot straight
with you guys.

39:04.541 --> 39:06.775
Barry tends to be
a little bit impulsive,

39:06.777 --> 39:10.512
and make rash decisions.
And it's my job to reign it in.

39:10.514 --> 39:12.112
So, we probably
should've called you guys

39:12.114 --> 39:17.519
before you boarded the plane,
but your performance,

39:17.521 --> 39:19.920
your act, whatever it is
that you guys do,

39:19.922 --> 39:21.891
has been pulled
from the party...

39:22.793 --> 39:23.994
unfortunately...

39:25.161 --> 39:26.927
for you.

39:26.929 --> 39:29.164
Pulled from the party,
what do you mean?

39:29.166 --> 39:30.764
We spoke to Barry Black
last week.

39:30.766 --> 39:33.568
Oh, I get it. Guys, come on.

39:33.570 --> 39:36.137
Prank the pranksters, right?

39:36.139 --> 39:38.740
- Where's the cameras?
- We're on <i>Punk'd!</i> Ashton!

39:38.742 --> 39:40.742
- Come on. We got you, man.
- Where is he, where is he?

39:40.744 --> 39:45.479
Listen! This party is going to be
perfect, but she is 15 years old,

39:45.481 --> 39:47.715
You know, I was a fan of all
sorts of things when I was 15,

39:47.717 --> 39:50.050
like, direct sunlight.

39:50.052 --> 39:52.019
We came all this way.

39:52.021 --> 39:54.456
Can't we at least appear
as guests?

39:54.458 --> 39:56.124
Look, listen!

39:56.126 --> 39:59.594
This party has...
it has simply classed up.

39:59.596 --> 40:02.996
Classed up? I mean, she's
15, how would a...?

40:02.998 --> 40:05.599
Okay, so we will be sending
you guys back Premium Economy.

40:05.601 --> 40:07.601
I'll make sure of it,
and you know what?

40:07.603 --> 40:09.570
Here is a little something
for your troubles.

40:09.572 --> 40:13.974
The Black family thanks you
for your cooperation.

40:13.976 --> 40:18.479
Wow. You're really gonna pay us
to not go to a party?

40:18.481 --> 40:21.115
Think of it this way,
you guys got paid to do nothing!

40:21.117 --> 40:23.650
That's not so bad, right?
All right, well go have fun!

40:23.652 --> 40:25.552
You know what, take that,
go to a Dodger game,

40:25.554 --> 40:27.188
see Disneyland.
I've gotta get going,

40:27.190 --> 40:28.789
so, take care of yourselves.

40:28.791 --> 40:31.761
Mm-hmm. Thank you.

40:33.829 --> 40:35.996
Man, seriously,
what is with that woman?

40:35.998 --> 40:39.133
I swear to God, she's got
something stuck up her ass.

40:39.135 --> 40:40.901
It's so deep,
she tries to get it out,

40:40.903 --> 40:42.237
but she just can't get it.

40:42.239 --> 40:44.137
That's why she's so
pissed off all the time.

40:44.139 --> 40:48.545
How can she do that? We came
all the way from Australia.

40:49.112 --> 40:51.144
Boys...

40:51.146 --> 40:53.514
People just don't get us.

40:53.516 --> 40:55.682
People treat us like shit!

40:55.684 --> 40:57.719
Sophia, Holly...

40:57.721 --> 41:01.192
Maybe we're just average.

41:04.561 --> 41:06.163
Well, at least we're going home.

41:09.065 --> 41:13.735
You guys... Barry Black
is at MCM right now.

41:13.737 --> 41:17.271
- Man Crush Mondays?
- No! Media Creative Management!

41:17.273 --> 41:20.742
I cannot believe
what I'm hearing right now.

41:20.744 --> 41:23.043
Average? We are not average!

41:23.045 --> 41:26.146
You guys are warriors!
Beasts!

41:26.148 --> 41:28.282
Creative people, okay!

41:28.284 --> 41:30.584
Wake up! Beau!

41:30.586 --> 41:33.921
You are like a sleeping dragon.
Awaken the dragon, okay?

41:33.923 --> 41:36.190
And you... wake up!

41:36.192 --> 41:38.626
Now, I want you guys
to repeat after me.

41:38.628 --> 41:41.128
We are not average!

41:41.130 --> 41:42.162
We are not average.

41:42.164 --> 41:44.865
No! We are not average!

41:44.867 --> 41:46.733
We are not average!

41:46.735 --> 41:49.103
Stand up! We are not average!

41:49.105 --> 41:51.606
- We are not average!
- Come in! We are not average!

41:51.608 --> 41:54.641
- We are not average!
- We are not average!

41:54.643 --> 41:57.144
- We are not average!
- We are not average!

41:57.146 --> 41:58.882
We are not average!

42:01.717 --> 42:03.617
Hey, how're you doing?

42:03.619 --> 42:07.054
Um, sorry, you have
really beautiful eyes.

42:07.056 --> 42:09.726
Really. Do you have
a boyfriend by any chance?

42:13.195 --> 42:15.862
I'm actually looking for
Barry Black?

42:15.864 --> 42:17.932
Hello, how are you?

42:17.934 --> 42:21.272
I've gotta see Barry Black.
I've got a piñata for him.

42:23.139 --> 42:25.072
Do you judge people
with piñatas always?

42:25.074 --> 42:26.175
Is that what it is?

42:27.309 --> 42:29.913
Flowers for Mr. Barry Black?

42:33.148 --> 42:36.987
We got balloons
for Mr. Barry Black?

42:38.655 --> 42:41.722
Barry Black?
Extension 303?

42:45.295 --> 42:47.063
Enjoy the flowers.

42:54.003 --> 42:57.005
He knows me, he knows me!

42:57.007 --> 42:58.706
I'm just doing my job!

43:00.309 --> 43:03.279
Get off me, get off me!
Get off me!

43:08.083 --> 43:10.952
Delivery for
Barry Black, please?

43:10.954 --> 43:13.287
- For Barry Black.
- For... okay

43:13.289 --> 43:15.225
- Barry Black.
- Barry Black.

43:26.001 --> 43:29.170
What we do at this company,
Tim and I, we build brands.

43:29.172 --> 43:30.938
- Okay.
- We build careers.

43:30.940 --> 43:33.074
Can you do, like,
collaborations,

43:33.076 --> 43:35.008
cause I really wanna do one
with The Rock,

43:35.010 --> 43:37.778
and I feel like he's interested
in social media,

43:37.780 --> 43:39.179
so that would be really cool.

43:39.181 --> 43:41.148
To me... to me,
and follow me on this,

43:41.150 --> 43:42.883
I love what you do.

43:42.885 --> 43:45.720
It's a hobby
that is very exciting.

43:45.722 --> 43:47.287
I wanna put you in the movies.

43:47.289 --> 43:51.458
Ooh! What's in the box?!

43:51.460 --> 43:53.760
- That's cool.
- What is this?

43:53.762 --> 43:56.130
The delivery guy
said it was urgent.

43:56.132 --> 43:58.900
- Who are you?
- I work for you.

43:58.902 --> 44:02.170
Why is there a big
box in my office?

44:07.177 --> 44:10.344
No way! Rose Farmhouse!

44:10.346 --> 44:13.081
- You're so beautiful!
- Who are you, and why...

44:13.083 --> 44:16.784
- What are you doing here?
- I don't know, just meeting a manager.

44:16.786 --> 44:19.052
Wow! We're, like,
huge fans of yours!

44:19.054 --> 44:22.490
Gentlemen, who are you, and why did
you just fall out of a big box?

44:22.492 --> 44:25.492
Hey, man, we're the Janoskians, we do
YouTube videos, and that type of thing.

44:25.494 --> 44:29.863
I'm so sorry, can we look up who The
Janoskians are? I have no idea who you are.

44:29.865 --> 44:31.798
I'm really sorry for
interrupting your meeting,

44:31.800 --> 44:33.800
but we're actually
looking for Barry Black.

44:33.802 --> 44:35.903
Have you guys seen him?
It's really important.

44:35.905 --> 44:38.039
What? Barry Black
left here hours ago.

44:38.041 --> 44:40.508
Hey, Craig!
I need security instantly!

44:40.510 --> 44:42.943
Rose, I've seen all
your stuff, I love it!

44:42.945 --> 44:46.880
- Thank you!
- Hey, Craig! I need you in here, now!

44:46.882 --> 44:49.349
We have a few gentlemen
that just popped out of a box!

44:49.351 --> 44:51.985
Do you think maybe we can do, like,
a collaboration or something?

44:51.987 --> 44:54.454
I would love too, yeah! That
would help grow my... finally!

44:54.456 --> 44:56.793
- They're perfect!
- No way!

45:01.063 --> 45:03.766
- Awesome, can I get your number, or...?
- Yeah!

45:07.402 --> 45:09.137
- So...
- Cool, yeah, I'll follow you.

45:09.139 --> 45:12.340
- So, you're finding management?
- Yeah. Wait, no, no!

45:12.342 --> 45:14.008
I can handle myself!

45:14.010 --> 45:15.309
It was nice meeting you!

45:15.311 --> 45:17.144
Aw, so cool!

45:17.146 --> 45:20.083
Can you get me
in a movie with them?

45:22.952 --> 45:26.186
Seriously? I thought that
only happened at night clubs!

45:26.188 --> 45:28.421
- What is this?
- Wanker!

45:28.423 --> 45:30.258
Now what?

45:30.260 --> 45:34.061
Guys, I don't think we
wasted our time with that one.

45:34.063 --> 45:35.896
We know where Barry Black lives!

45:35.898 --> 45:38.935
He can't keep us out now!

45:51.347 --> 45:53.417
Check out Alison's photos.

45:55.418 --> 45:57.284
Aw!

45:57.286 --> 45:59.887
She looks super sad.

45:59.889 --> 46:02.255
Money just doesn't
buy happiness, Luke.

46:02.257 --> 46:05.927
Speak for yourself! If I had that kinda
money, I would throw the sickest party!

46:07.931 --> 46:10.000
You guys thinking
what I'm thinking?

46:12.168 --> 46:13.867
Let's throw a party.

46:13.869 --> 46:16.137
We gotta take this party
back from Holly!

46:16.139 --> 46:19.440
We're gonna give Alison the best party ever!

46:21.510 --> 46:23.276
We'll take this party over!

46:28.585 --> 46:31.385
Check it out, check it out,
check it out!

46:38.961 --> 46:42.295
Guys, we have 24 hours
until we take over this party.

46:42.297 --> 46:44.865
If we can pull this off,
we're gonna be legends.

46:44.867 --> 46:47.001
How the hell
are we gonna get in?

46:47.003 --> 46:49.871
There should be valet,
so, I'll figure it out.

46:49.873 --> 46:51.905
I just gotta figure out
how to get Casey in.

46:51.907 --> 46:53.941
I've got a backup entrance,
it's right here.

46:53.943 --> 46:56.644
You come through there,
these are our positions.

46:56.646 --> 46:59.447
This is a no-go zone,
this is a no-go zone,

46:59.449 --> 47:03.016
this is a no-go zone.
You see Holly, run!

47:03.018 --> 47:04.651
What are we gonna do
once we're inside?

47:04.653 --> 47:06.621
We need to make
this party fun.

47:06.623 --> 47:09.023
- What are we gonna do?
- We're gonna go big!

47:09.025 --> 47:13.594
- We gotta do something huge!
- I wonder how much is on this.

47:13.596 --> 47:16.097
There's only one way
to find out.

47:16.099 --> 47:18.666
- Give that to me.
- Yeah, Chucky, come on!

47:18.668 --> 47:21.471
- Give us something good, baby!
- Come on, come on!

47:23.273 --> 47:27.641
- So?
- $30,000!

47:37.320 --> 47:38.952
What are you doing

47:38.954 --> 47:40.655
with all those invitations?

47:40.657 --> 47:42.923
It's not a real party
unless everyone can come.

47:42.925 --> 47:45.258
We do this right, we're gonna
have the best night ever!

47:45.260 --> 47:47.028
Party time!

47:56.940 --> 47:58.342
What's up, man?

48:23.333 --> 48:24.597
Another box.

48:24.599 --> 48:25.700
And another one!

48:25.702 --> 48:26.700
The last one!

48:28.070 --> 48:29.637
See that one right there?

48:29.639 --> 48:31.171
- This one?
- Yeah.

48:31.173 --> 48:32.974
It's for me and Casey.

48:32.976 --> 48:35.409
I'm taking her out on a date.

48:35.411 --> 48:37.077
Nice.

48:37.079 --> 48:40.014
- Take it.
- Take it.

48:40.016 --> 48:43.284
- All right, let's go!
- Barry's gonna freak out!

48:48.157 --> 48:50.458
Kinda looks like Sophia,
eh Beau?

48:50.460 --> 48:51.662
Beau?

48:58.601 --> 49:01.038
- Hi!
- Hey!

49:02.271 --> 49:04.204
I didn't think
you'd actually come.

49:04.206 --> 49:05.639
I know, I went to
the wrong pier, but,

49:05.641 --> 49:08.141
I'm here to... fish with you!

49:08.143 --> 49:12.345
Although I have to say, I'm kinda
surprised that you wanted to go fishing

49:12.347 --> 49:15.316
given the whole, you know,
jellyfish situation.

49:15.318 --> 49:18.485
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Cause you know, if this goes bad,

49:18.487 --> 49:20.487
I'm not gonna pee on you.

49:20.489 --> 49:24.291
- Really?
- I just... I don't think we're there yet.

49:24.293 --> 49:26.659
Wow! I'm glad
I got to know you early!

49:28.231 --> 49:30.164
Okay, wait,
am I doing this right?

49:30.166 --> 49:32.499
So, if you feel a little bit
of tightening, you do this.

49:32.501 --> 49:35.802
Just, um...

49:35.804 --> 49:37.338
- Okay.
- And as hard as you can,

49:37.340 --> 49:38.805
you just gotta wind it up.

49:38.807 --> 49:41.041
Okay, so just,
move it that way?

49:41.043 --> 49:43.177
I think so, I think that's it.

49:43.179 --> 49:45.278
Ah! Okay!

49:45.280 --> 49:47.748
- I think we should make things interesting.
- How?

49:47.750 --> 49:53.420
I think if you catch a fish,
then I will eat it raw.

49:53.422 --> 49:56.791
- Oh...
- And if I catch a fish, you should eat it raw.

49:56.793 --> 49:58.659
- You're challenging me!
- I am.

49:58.661 --> 50:00.728
- Well!
- What, are you afraid mister prankster?

50:00.730 --> 50:03.496
No, I never said I was afraid,
I love a good challenge!

50:03.498 --> 50:05.699
I didn't know you were
into challenges, let's do it.

50:05.701 --> 50:07.003
Deal!

50:08.771 --> 50:12.238
- I feel like there's a little, it's pulling or something.
- Oh, hold on.

50:12.240 --> 50:14.075
- Yeah, you got something!
- I did?

50:14.077 --> 50:15.842
- Yup! Uh-huh.
- Oh, my God.

50:15.844 --> 50:18.579
- We got one!
- Okay, really?

50:18.581 --> 50:20.514
Yeah, yeah. We got one!

50:20.516 --> 50:22.615
- Is it big?
- Is it big?

50:26.355 --> 50:27.724
Yeah.

50:29.492 --> 50:31.492
Beau, you have to eat it raw.

50:31.494 --> 50:33.630
Oh my God, I can't!

50:34.630 --> 50:36.296
He won't, he's not gonna do it.

50:36.298 --> 50:38.398
Oh my God, he did it!

50:38.400 --> 50:40.436
Wow.

50:49.778 --> 50:51.612
I had so much fun today.

50:51.614 --> 50:55.349
It was definitely a different
experience for a first date.

50:55.351 --> 50:58.385
Going fishing and all,
but, it was really fun.

50:58.387 --> 51:02.289
Definitely the most, craziest
date, I've ever been on.

51:02.291 --> 51:05.391
- Yeah, well....
- That was definitely memorable.

51:05.393 --> 51:09.630
You know, if you ever
wanna eat sushi with me,

51:09.632 --> 51:12.800
not at the pier, I know
a lot of great places.

51:12.802 --> 51:18.474
If, you know, you decide to
stay in LA, or whatever.

51:19.675 --> 51:21.374
Maybe.

51:21.376 --> 51:23.112
Hmm.

51:31.721 --> 51:35.488
Um... so, tomorrow night,
I'll see you at the party, yeah?

51:35.490 --> 51:38.358
I think the party's
gonna be a bust,

51:38.360 --> 51:41.327
- we're probably just gonna head home.
- What? I mean, come on,

51:41.329 --> 51:43.496
it can't be a bust,
it's like a Barry Black party,

51:43.498 --> 51:46.402
- people die to get into that!
- Yeah.

51:49.204 --> 51:53.706
Unless... unless you don't
want me to come anymore,

51:53.708 --> 51:57.478
- which is totally okay, it's not a big deal.
- No, no.

51:57.480 --> 51:59.847
- I really do want you to come.
- Are you sure?

51:59.849 --> 52:02.182
- Yeah. Yes.
- You're sure?

52:02.184 --> 52:04.885
- Yes.
- Okay. So, tomorrow night.

52:04.887 --> 52:06.619
At the party?

52:06.621 --> 52:08.923
Tomorrow night.

52:08.925 --> 52:10.727
I'll see you then, Beau.

52:15.864 --> 52:17.433
Goodnight, Beau!

52:31.514 --> 52:34.748
Barry, hi! So, it looks
like you're still in the air,

52:34.750 --> 52:36.816
do you know how much longer
till you're on the ground?

52:36.818 --> 52:39.353
<i>Well, approximately
two hours, I'll be landing.</i>

52:39.355 --> 52:41.789
<i>How's Alison doing?
Is she happy?</i>

52:41.791 --> 52:44.490
She's wonderful,
everything is perfect.

52:44.492 --> 52:45.858
<i>Is she smiling?</i>

52:45.860 --> 52:47.561
I mean, Barry,
you know your daughter,

52:47.563 --> 52:49.496
she's not much of a smiler,
but you know,

52:49.498 --> 52:51.699
I think I saw something happen.
Can you help him?

52:51.701 --> 52:54.467
<i>What about The Janoskians,
are they ready to go?</i>

52:54.469 --> 52:56.570
<i>What stunt
are they gonna do, anyway?</i>

52:56.572 --> 52:59.373
Unfortunately, The
Janoskians aren't able to make it.

52:59.375 --> 53:03.376
One of them has to have emergency
surgery, some sort of bum shoulder.

53:03.378 --> 53:05.512
<i>Wait up!
I'm just hearing this shit now?</i>

53:05.514 --> 53:08.648
<i>Come on, Holly! God damn!</i>

53:08.650 --> 53:10.684
Barry, look, everything
is going to be perfect!

53:10.686 --> 53:12.820
This is going to be
the party of the year!

53:12.822 --> 53:14.921
This is our coming out
party to LA,

53:14.923 --> 53:17.324
and besides I have a lot
of other entertainment,

53:17.326 --> 53:19.525
that's much better than anything
The Janoskians would have done.

53:19.527 --> 53:21.829
<i>Wait, wait, wait,
did I just hear our party?</i>

53:21.831 --> 53:23.764
<i>This is not our party.</i>

53:23.766 --> 53:27.034
<i>This is Alison's sweet 16,
I want what Alison wants.</i>

53:27.036 --> 53:30.436
- <i>You still like working with me, don't you?</i>
- Yes!

53:30.438 --> 53:32.572
- <i>Do I take care of you?</i>
- Yes.

53:32.574 --> 53:35.309
- <i>Do I show you the money?</i>
- Yes, of course.

53:35.311 --> 53:37.845
- <i>Am I your best boss, you ever had?</i>
- Yes.

53:37.847 --> 53:39.880
<i>So can you just
make my daughter happy</i>

53:39.882 --> 53:43.284
- <i>on this one special day?</i>
- Barry, it's covered!

53:43.286 --> 53:46.820
By the end of this, your daughter's going
to be the toast of her new school.

53:46.822 --> 53:48.889
I mean, how many years
have I been working for you?

53:48.891 --> 53:51.458
<i>Too damned long! And I treated
you better than anybody</i>

53:51.460 --> 53:55.061
<i>that you ever worked for,
especially Diddy!</i>

53:55.063 --> 53:57.398
<i>This party better be all that
and a bag of chips,</i>

53:57.400 --> 54:00.670
<i>or this is your ass... Holly!</i>

54:05.541 --> 54:08.041
Where the hell
are my Monkey Orchids!

54:08.043 --> 54:09.476
What are we doing, man?

54:09.478 --> 54:10.911
All right, big night here, boys.

54:10.913 --> 54:12.479
Holly and her staff
are on channel one,

54:12.481 --> 54:13.579
we're on channel nine.

54:13.581 --> 54:15.816
Channel one and nine, got it.

54:15.818 --> 54:17.650
Wait, do these work?

54:17.652 --> 54:20.354
Hello? Mic check, hello?
Is anyone there?

54:20.356 --> 54:22.822
<i>Who is it, and why are you
just now checking your walkie?</i>

54:22.824 --> 54:24.525
- What are you doing, man?
- Shh! Checking my mic!

54:24.527 --> 54:27.360
- Channel nine!
- <i>Hello?</i>

54:27.362 --> 54:28.829
<i>I need you
to state your name now.</i>

54:28.831 --> 54:31.932
Hey, this is
Brad with the delivery,

54:31.934 --> 54:34.767
listen we've just pulled up
front, and we want someone

54:34.769 --> 54:37.637
to meet us out there, that
would be totally gnarly, dude.

54:37.639 --> 54:39.873
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

54:39.875 --> 54:42.041
It worked! How was the accent?

54:42.043 --> 54:43.409
- That was really good.
- It was?

54:43.411 --> 54:44.510
All right boys,

54:44.512 --> 54:45.512
everything that we've done,

54:45.514 --> 54:46.813
up until this point,

54:46.815 --> 54:48.782
is for this moment right now.

54:48.784 --> 54:51.651
Are we ready to give Alison
the best birthday party?

54:51.653 --> 54:53.586
- I'm ready.
- We can do it.

54:53.588 --> 54:55.021
- Do a dance for me, would you?
- Any dance.

54:55.023 --> 54:57.423
- Yeah, nice!
- Daniel, give me a cockatoo face!

54:57.425 --> 55:00.561
Yeah, boy!
Gimme a... yeah nice!

55:00.563 --> 55:02.662
Everyone, hands in, hands in!

55:02.664 --> 55:06.835
Dance, dance,
dance, dance, dance, dance!

55:07.869 --> 55:10.604
Shhh.

55:10.606 --> 55:13.943
Dance, dance,
dance, dance, dance, dance.

55:17.612 --> 55:20.514
- Jai, leave the sword.
- Why?

55:20.516 --> 55:23.519
- You're not gonna stab someone.
- All right.

55:26.755 --> 55:29.055
All right, boys...

55:29.057 --> 55:30.559
We love you!

55:59.954 --> 56:01.623
What kinda drugs
are you selling?

56:04.960 --> 56:06.827
Whoo!

56:10.498 --> 56:12.666
What the hell was that!

56:12.668 --> 56:14.436
Who's in charge here, who?

56:15.471 --> 56:16.670
First of all,
put your hands down.

56:16.672 --> 56:18.070
That's a quarter million
dollar car,

56:18.072 --> 56:19.706
what kind of employees
you got here?

56:19.708 --> 56:21.108
Whoa, whoa, what happened?

56:21.110 --> 56:22.775
The valet took off
with my car,

56:22.777 --> 56:24.744
like he's a Formula 1 driver.

56:24.746 --> 56:25.914
Which one of
your guys did this?

56:45.701 --> 56:47.469
Hey, you guys,
why are you just getting here?

56:48.771 --> 56:50.006
What's happening?

56:55.110 --> 56:57.144
Holly, there's a problem
with a valet.

56:57.146 --> 56:58.778
- We need to deal with it right now.
- Oh, great, of course.

56:58.780 --> 57:00.746
Soon as everyone's
supposed to arrive.

57:00.748 --> 57:02.451
Frankie, go to three!

57:10.893 --> 57:13.596
Excuse me,
where are you taking those?

57:16.898 --> 57:18.965
Hello! Welcome!

57:18.967 --> 57:23.005
We are so happy to have you here,
thank you so much for making it!

57:31.914 --> 57:34.213
We are also serving rose,
and champagne...

57:34.215 --> 57:37.083
<i>Jai, Holly's
right below you. Get down!</i>

57:37.085 --> 57:40.656
That is it, I do not
wanna see anything else.

57:44.893 --> 57:47.629
<i>Phase one, complete.</i>

58:27.702 --> 58:30.137
The party's so boring,
we have to do something.

58:30.139 --> 58:32.171
We gotta wake this party up.

58:32.173 --> 58:34.608
Hey, I'm Luke,
and this is my ugly twin.

58:34.610 --> 58:36.842
Hey, I think I'm
the better looking one here.

58:36.844 --> 58:39.246
Excuse me, which party
do you think you're at?

58:39.248 --> 58:40.981
This is a sweet 16!

58:40.983 --> 58:43.182
Come on, Beau,
am I the nut, have a drink!

58:43.184 --> 58:44.985
Have a drink, have a drink.

58:44.987 --> 58:47.854
I just want to try it on.

58:47.856 --> 58:50.222
Is it a turtle neck? Oh, sweet!

58:50.224 --> 58:53.059
I got myself a new...
Jai, Luke, he gave me this.

58:53.061 --> 58:55.028
- No way!
- He gave me this.

58:55.030 --> 58:57.033
- Is that his?
- Yeah, thanks man!

58:59.168 --> 59:01.735
Swish!

59:01.737 --> 59:05.938
Hey! It's a sweet 16!
So, don't leave!

59:05.940 --> 59:08.240
- Hey, man!
- I think that's enough drinks for you.

59:08.242 --> 59:11.144
I gotta get you some water.

59:14.882 --> 59:17.653
Come on, Alison,
try and have some fun.

59:21.657 --> 59:24.027
Yo, yo.
Want something to drink?

59:25.728 --> 59:27.793
Hi, Jay, how are you?

59:27.795 --> 59:30.363
- How you been?
- Thank you so much for making it!

59:30.365 --> 59:32.898
- What's going on, what we doing tonight?
- This is Barry's daughter,

59:32.900 --> 59:35.702
- Alison's 16th birthday party.
- Okay, weird.

59:35.704 --> 59:37.304
You know, I didn't want
this to be like the typical

59:37.306 --> 59:39.005
16-year-old birthday party,
so I took over the whole thing.

59:39.007 --> 59:41.742
- This is a big ass party.
- And...

59:41.744 --> 59:43.110
You got Snapchat?

59:43.112 --> 59:44.644
I don't have Snapchat.

59:44.646 --> 59:46.179
Snapchat, so you can
send me some snaps,

59:46.181 --> 59:47.414
you know what I'm saying,
the boobs,

59:47.416 --> 59:48.815
you know what I'm saying?

59:48.817 --> 59:50.751
Oh, oh, that will
not be happening.

59:50.753 --> 59:52.385
But you could...

59:52.387 --> 59:54.787
Sorry, Holly we just ran out
of all of our amuse-bouche.

59:54.789 --> 59:57.958
I'm sorry, how did that happen?
The party just started.

59:57.960 --> 01:00:00.293
That guy over there with the
green eyes, he ate everything.

01:00:00.295 --> 01:00:01.864
He's walking away.

01:00:03.331 --> 01:00:05.100
I'm sorry, I'll be right back.

01:00:07.036 --> 01:00:08.702
What the hell you got on, man?

01:00:08.704 --> 01:00:10.873
I don't know, I'm just
trying to make a living.

01:00:19.047 --> 01:00:20.447
Sorry we're late, guys.

01:00:20.449 --> 01:00:24.383
Hey buddy, you're at
a sushi restaurant, eat up!

01:00:24.385 --> 01:00:26.787
Can you just, aah!

01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:29.456
- Oh!
- No, you need to do it more in the middle,

01:00:29.458 --> 01:00:32.693
grab some of this pink
stuff, there we go.

01:00:32.695 --> 01:00:35.095
Like that, there we go.

01:00:35.097 --> 01:00:37.764
You have to take a lick.
Like that.

01:00:37.766 --> 01:00:41.170
You outta try this, biggest sushi
roll in the world. Come on!

01:00:42.771 --> 01:00:46.305
Eat it!
Come on, eat the... eat it.

01:00:46.307 --> 01:00:48.208
This is called the look away.

01:00:48.210 --> 01:00:50.746
Yeah, hey, put your
finger in, yeah.

01:00:52.914 --> 01:00:56.148
Have you guys ever
heard of champagne Jenga?

01:00:56.150 --> 01:00:59.786
Okay, if I can get this cup out,
without breaking it.

01:00:59.788 --> 01:01:01.487
I get to drink it, okay?

01:01:01.489 --> 01:01:04.926
If it falls,
well, no one gets anything.

01:01:07.262 --> 01:01:10.033
I did it! I actually did it!

01:01:16.304 --> 01:01:18.271
<i>Holly, we need
you over at the sushi bar.</i>

01:01:18.273 --> 01:01:19.876
Great, of course.

01:01:24.813 --> 01:01:26.313
Guys, Casey's here.

01:01:26.315 --> 01:01:28.081
Nope, not on the list.

01:01:28.083 --> 01:01:30.083
Who invited you?
Are you kidding me?

01:01:30.085 --> 01:01:32.853
Anybody here
actually invited to the party?

01:01:32.855 --> 01:01:35.921
So, apparently,
I am in Hell's Kitchen.

01:01:35.923 --> 01:01:37.824
The three of you have not done
anything that I have asked.

01:01:37.826 --> 01:01:40.994
We are supposed to be prepared
for any, and all situations!

01:01:40.996 --> 01:01:42.362
<i>Holly?</i>

01:01:42.364 --> 01:01:44.363
Wait, so who's party
is this again?

01:01:44.365 --> 01:01:46.365
Okay, remember that crazy
Uber ride that I took,

01:01:46.367 --> 01:01:48.235
and I met that Australian guy
who was really cute?

01:01:48.237 --> 01:01:49.739
- Right.
- His party.

01:01:50.472 --> 01:01:52.072
Guys.

01:01:52.074 --> 01:01:54.077
Hey, I was just inside,
I'm gonna be right back.

01:01:55.943 --> 01:01:58.110
Skip to the end
of the line, please.

01:01:58.112 --> 01:02:00.780
Your breath smells disgusting,
just step back.

01:02:00.782 --> 01:02:02.816
How does he know Barry Black?

01:02:02.818 --> 01:02:05.786
Um, that's kind of complicated to
explain, but he has cute friends!

01:02:05.788 --> 01:02:08.190
- Hi. Whoa. Hi.
- Casey! Hey!

01:02:09.224 --> 01:02:12.291
This is a total shit show,

01:02:12.293 --> 01:02:13.994
do you think
we'll be able to get in?

01:02:13.996 --> 01:02:15.262
Yeah, of course, yeah.

01:02:15.264 --> 01:02:16.932
- You sure?
- Come on.

01:02:18.467 --> 01:02:20.103
They're friends.

01:02:22.070 --> 01:02:25.037
Hey, Maria!
How you doing, Maria?

01:02:25.039 --> 01:02:27.374
- No, Chloe.
- Chloe, Chloe.

01:02:27.376 --> 01:02:31.110
Um, so I was just inside,
and these are my three friends,

01:02:31.112 --> 01:02:33.215
I was just wondering if
I could bring them in.

01:02:34.016 --> 01:02:35.215
Holly?

01:02:35.217 --> 01:02:37.083
I don't know if you can hear me

01:02:37.085 --> 01:02:39.385
<i>but we have a ton
of uninvited guests out front.</i>

01:02:39.387 --> 01:02:41.188
Yeah, we need you out here.

01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:43.190
No, no, no,
we're getting you guys in.

01:02:43.192 --> 01:02:45.057
No worries, I'm gonna call
Barry right now,

01:02:45.059 --> 01:02:46.293
and be right back, okay.

01:02:46.295 --> 01:02:49.061
Thank you, peace, yeah, thanks.

01:02:49.063 --> 01:02:51.298
Let's go this way.

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:53.032
<i>Boys, I can't get Casey
and her friends in.</i>

01:02:53.034 --> 01:02:56.404
<i>I look like an idiot!
I need some help. ASAP.</i>

01:02:59.608 --> 01:03:01.407
Where are we going?

01:03:01.409 --> 01:03:03.909
This is just like
a quicker way to get to Barry,

01:03:03.911 --> 01:03:05.612
so we're gonna go this way.

01:03:05.614 --> 01:03:07.947
Right, so you're telling me
I'm about to enter this party

01:03:07.949 --> 01:03:10.450
through the backyard,
okay, makes a lot of sense!

01:03:10.452 --> 01:03:12.952
Hey, you gotta appreciate
the nature sometimes.

01:03:12.954 --> 01:03:16.289
See, Americans don't do that,
Australians love nature.

01:03:16.291 --> 01:03:18.358
I could be at the club
right now, y'all.

01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:20.163
Not even gonna lie.

01:03:21.530 --> 01:03:25.565
Um, Beau, is that
gonna be a problem?

01:03:25.567 --> 01:03:27.333
He looks kinda intense.

01:03:27.335 --> 01:03:29.302
Oh, no, not at all!
I'm great with dogs.

01:03:29.304 --> 01:03:31.338
Yeah, but it's at
Barry Black's house.

01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:33.072
He's probably a good
guard dog, I don't know.

01:03:33.074 --> 01:03:35.076
Good boy!

01:03:39.146 --> 01:03:41.648
- Beau, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:03:41.650 --> 01:03:44.217
<i>Guys, there's a dog
at the side gate.</i>

01:03:44.219 --> 01:03:46.619
<i>I need someone to come
distract it, quick!</i>

01:03:46.621 --> 01:03:48.021
Got you, Beau.

01:03:50.626 --> 01:03:52.961
Open the gate!

01:04:08.643 --> 01:04:10.911
Was he wearing bacon?

01:04:10.913 --> 01:04:12.481
After you, ladies.

01:04:16.251 --> 01:04:18.019
Oh, my God.

01:04:19.954 --> 01:04:21.223
Wow.

01:04:23.157 --> 01:04:25.557
This is a sweet 16?

01:04:25.559 --> 01:04:27.360
I know, it's disgusting.

01:04:27.362 --> 01:04:30.195
I swear that guy over there
looks like he's about to die.

01:04:30.197 --> 01:04:31.597
There's like
no teenagers here.

01:04:31.599 --> 01:04:33.300
Tell me about it.

01:04:33.302 --> 01:04:35.334
I have to go
do something really quick.

01:04:35.336 --> 01:04:39.072
- I'll be right back. Sorry.
- Okay.

01:04:39.074 --> 01:04:41.340
- I'll just... see you inside?
- Go on in the house.

01:04:41.342 --> 01:04:43.346
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:04:51.652 --> 01:04:53.720
What's going on in here?

01:04:53.722 --> 01:04:56.555
Passing the time.

01:04:56.557 --> 01:04:58.458
Well,
the best sequence of the...

01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:01.394
...is about to start.

01:05:01.396 --> 01:05:05.298
- Can I go now?
- Yeah, you can go, you can come with me,

01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:07.637
and enjoy the party
that I've thrown for you.

01:05:09.471 --> 01:05:11.403
I'm gonna call Jerry.

01:05:11.405 --> 01:05:14.039
It's three in the morning there,
it's three in the morning there.

01:05:14.041 --> 01:05:16.008
He is not gonna
pick up the phone!

01:05:16.010 --> 01:05:18.644
You sound crazy,
you sound crazy!

01:05:18.646 --> 01:05:21.180
- I don't know how to calm you down.
- All I wanna do is go home!

01:05:21.182 --> 01:05:23.016
- We can't go home.
- Can I have more, please?

01:05:23.018 --> 01:05:25.418
No... she can't.

01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:28.554
I'm so sorry, I am so sorry.

01:05:28.556 --> 01:05:31.124
We are just, we are a little bit
out of our element.

01:05:31.126 --> 01:05:32.691
We don't know anybody here.

01:05:32.693 --> 01:05:34.526
- I...
- Can I?

01:05:34.528 --> 01:05:36.563
Uh, Vodka does
weird things to her.

01:05:36.565 --> 01:05:38.630
I... I...

01:05:38.632 --> 01:05:40.467
I feel calm right now.

01:05:40.469 --> 01:05:43.972
Oh, this is good.

01:05:45.139 --> 01:05:47.076
Do you guys wanna go upstairs?

01:05:48.210 --> 01:05:50.142
Yeah.

01:05:50.144 --> 01:05:53.081
Hey, you smell like bacon,
I like it.

01:05:55.182 --> 01:05:57.316
Do you know how many
16-year-olds can say

01:05:57.318 --> 01:06:00.119
that they have witnessed
the most respected play

01:06:00.121 --> 01:06:05.724
from the kabuki tradition performed by
one of the original actors' descendants?

01:06:05.726 --> 01:06:07.559
We're gonna go
hang out in my room.

01:06:07.561 --> 01:06:09.695
Let go of me.

01:06:09.697 --> 01:06:12.532
You know, I'm actually feeling a
little underappreciated by you.

01:06:12.534 --> 01:06:15.434
I have worked tirelessly
to make this the perfect party,

01:06:15.436 --> 01:06:17.737
and this entire room
is full of esteemed guests

01:06:17.739 --> 01:06:19.671
that I have invited myself.

01:06:19.673 --> 01:06:21.641
I'm 16.

01:06:21.643 --> 01:06:24.177
Yeah, and it is never too soon
to start networking,

01:06:24.179 --> 01:06:26.646
so you need to start
enjoying your party.

01:06:26.648 --> 01:06:29.018
You mean your party.

01:06:54.576 --> 01:06:56.775
You know how small
it was, and now it's so big.

01:06:56.777 --> 01:06:59.244
Oh, my God, it's so big!

01:06:59.246 --> 01:07:01.815
- Can I film this?
- Yeah, film it.

01:07:01.817 --> 01:07:03.849
- Do you guys care if I film it?
- No, man.

01:07:03.851 --> 01:07:07.153
- I can't believe...
- It almost came down!

01:07:07.155 --> 01:07:09.155
- Did you blow on it?
- No, I didn't blow on it.

01:07:09.157 --> 01:07:10.722
- Did you blow on it?
- I didn't blow on it.

01:07:10.724 --> 01:07:12.492
Monica's really good at blowing.

01:08:07.382 --> 01:08:09.684
Someone call 911!

01:08:11.318 --> 01:08:13.755
This isn't supposed to happen,
this is a perfect party!

01:08:21.828 --> 01:08:24.397
<i>Holly,
Barry's pulling up right now.</i>

01:08:24.399 --> 01:08:25.932
<i>We need you out here, ASAP.</i>

01:08:25.934 --> 01:08:27.332
Oh, my God, I can't...

01:08:27.335 --> 01:08:28.500
I can't believe
this is happening.

01:08:28.502 --> 01:08:30.238
I can't believe
this is happening.

01:08:34.576 --> 01:08:38.443
<i>Daniel, is it working?
Is it inflating Daniel, come on!</i>

01:08:38.444 --> 01:08:39.581
<i>Talk to me!</i>

01:08:41.649 --> 01:08:44.216
- What happened to the lights?
- Chuck!

01:08:44.219 --> 01:08:45.854
<i>Daniel, do you copy?</i>

01:08:48.555 --> 01:08:50.857
<i>Daniel, talk to me,
why isn't this working?</i>

01:08:50.859 --> 01:08:53.792
<i>You idiot! Talk to me,
you're ruining this!</i>

01:08:58.667 --> 01:09:00.469
It's alive!

01:09:04.270 --> 01:09:05.640
Oh.

01:09:06.506 --> 01:09:08.808
- We should go.
- Okay.

01:09:08.810 --> 01:09:11.647
- It was so nice to meet you.
- Have a good night.

01:09:12.514 --> 01:09:14.416
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:09:25.426 --> 01:09:27.727
Get the hell out!

01:09:27.729 --> 01:09:30.897
I did not invite
any of these people.

01:09:30.899 --> 01:09:33.799
Oh, please, excuse me, did you really
think that you were gonna get inside?

01:09:33.801 --> 01:09:36.501
Go back to whatever Burning Man
village you came from.

01:09:36.502 --> 01:09:38.004
All of you! Who are you people?

01:09:38.006 --> 01:09:41.941
Barry! Welcome.
How's it going? Good to see you!

01:09:41.943 --> 01:09:43.776
- Welcome, this is the party!
- What is...

01:09:43.778 --> 01:09:45.812
You know, actually,
I'm totally sorry,

01:09:45.814 --> 01:09:48.447
but I am gonna call the cops,
and this is nothing

01:09:48.448 --> 01:09:50.950
it's just a little beef tartar
incident, don't worry about it.

01:09:50.952 --> 01:09:53.318
- Where's Alison?
- Alison is somewhere,

01:09:53.319 --> 01:09:54.887
but we will find her
in just a minute.

01:09:54.889 --> 01:09:56.688
I wouldn't worry
about that right now.

01:09:56.690 --> 01:09:58.458
Actually, there's something
I would love to show you

01:09:58.460 --> 01:09:59.892
really quick if you
would let me show you.

01:09:59.894 --> 01:10:02.428
- No, I wanna see Alison.
- No, I think that...

01:10:02.430 --> 01:10:04.530
Barry, Barry!

01:10:04.532 --> 01:10:06.566
What the hell?

01:10:06.568 --> 01:10:07.703
Kabuki?

01:10:12.841 --> 01:10:15.878
- Daddy.
- Oh, Alison, Alison...

01:10:17.345 --> 01:10:19.044
It's okay.

01:10:19.046 --> 01:10:21.481
I'm so sorry I'm late.
I disappointed you, I know.

01:10:21.483 --> 01:10:23.516
What happened to
that kabuki dancer?

01:10:23.518 --> 01:10:26.986
Oh, she ran off. It was all a prank,
it was actually pretty awesome.

01:10:26.988 --> 01:10:30.623
It was awesome,
I mean, the party kinda sucked.

01:10:30.625 --> 01:10:33.293
But we're having fun.

01:10:33.295 --> 01:10:36.728
- See, I have been taking great care of her, Barry!
- I'm not talking to you, Holly!

01:10:36.730 --> 01:10:38.266
Okay?

01:10:42.037 --> 01:10:43.936
This was a prank?

01:10:45.539 --> 01:10:48.310
Are they still performing?

01:10:49.010 --> 01:10:50.679
I don't know.

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:53.515
I don't think he's breathing.

01:10:55.850 --> 01:10:59.552
I'm gonna say we should
definitely take this sword.

01:10:59.554 --> 01:11:02.958
Well, definitely
looks interesting.

01:11:04.591 --> 01:11:08.460
- Oh, yeah, very interesting.
- Shh.

01:11:08.462 --> 01:11:11.798
- You did a great job up there.
- Thank you.

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:13.369
Gotta go.

01:11:14.769 --> 01:11:16.936
It's okay,
I'll find you, or something.

01:11:16.938 --> 01:11:18.737
Okay.

01:11:18.739 --> 01:11:21.340
He's just busy,
we'll find him.

01:11:21.342 --> 01:11:23.742
I had no idea Holly was trying
to throw a party for herself,

01:11:23.744 --> 01:11:26.745
- can you believe that shit?
- She does it every time, Dad.

01:11:26.747 --> 01:11:28.848
I mean why does
she still work for you?

01:11:28.850 --> 01:11:30.782
Hey, listen, there's some
people with certain qualities

01:11:30.784 --> 01:11:33.852
that I don't have, that I need,
and she is one of them.

01:11:33.854 --> 01:11:40.093
Next year I just want it to
be me, you, and my friends.

01:11:40.095 --> 01:11:43.795
- Really? Okay, I promise.
- Okay.

01:11:43.797 --> 01:11:45.897
- I'll make sure that happens.
- Okay.

01:11:45.899 --> 01:11:47.536
- I love you.
- I love you too.

01:11:49.804 --> 01:11:51.940
Oh, my God!

01:11:58.579 --> 01:12:02.484
Whoo!

01:12:04.418 --> 01:12:05.918
The Janoskians!

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:08.754
Hey, guys,
we're The Janoskians!

01:12:08.756 --> 01:12:10.889
And we've come
all the way from Australia

01:12:10.891 --> 01:12:13.793
to celebrate Alison's sweet 16!

01:12:13.795 --> 01:12:15.460
Where are you, Alison,
are you out there?

01:12:15.462 --> 01:12:17.597
For you, we hope
you have a special night, baby!

01:12:17.599 --> 01:12:20.400

Barry, man. So sorry
about ruining this party, man.

01:15:17.345 --> 01:15:20.580
What?! Are you insane?

01:15:20.582 --> 01:15:22.315
Best party
I ever had in my life!

01:15:22.317 --> 01:15:24.116
Look at my baby, she's happy!

01:15:24.118 --> 01:15:26.919
Look at Alison.

01:15:26.921 --> 01:15:30.889
Excuse me, may I have my daughter
back for a moment, please?

01:15:30.891 --> 01:15:33.259
I know you DJ's,
I know what you're up to.

01:15:33.261 --> 01:15:35.794
Try to get the room moody,
so you can get the booty.

01:15:35.796 --> 01:15:37.996
I should go DJ.

01:15:37.998 --> 01:15:40.165
- Yes, you should.
- Yeah.

01:15:40.167 --> 01:15:41.767
Holly, I have to admit.

01:15:41.769 --> 01:15:43.335
You fooled me
with this kabuki shit.

01:15:43.337 --> 01:15:45.170
- Well...
- You fooled me, you fooled me.

01:15:45.172 --> 01:15:47.873
- Um...
- This is the greatest party ever.

01:15:47.875 --> 01:15:49.976
I have a confession.

01:15:49.978 --> 01:15:51.777
None of this would have
happened without The Janoskians.

01:15:51.779 --> 01:15:53.044
I had nothing to do
with any of this.

01:15:53.046 --> 01:15:54.746
Barry, if it wasn't for her,

01:15:54.748 --> 01:15:56.147
we wouldn't all be together.

01:15:56.149 --> 01:15:58.683
Whatever it is, guys,
it doesn't matter.

01:15:58.685 --> 01:16:00.385
My baby girl is happy.

01:16:00.387 --> 01:16:02.888
Alison, you're gonna remember
this party

01:16:02.890 --> 01:16:04.290
till the last day of your life.

01:16:04.292 --> 01:16:07.159
- I am daddy, I am!
- Fella's, whoa!

01:16:07.161 --> 01:16:09.128
Cody!

01:16:09.130 --> 01:16:10.729
What's going on?

01:16:10.731 --> 01:16:12.031
Listen, I handled
that whole police situation,

01:16:12.033 --> 01:16:13.132
so the house is good, all right?

01:16:13.134 --> 01:16:14.933
Plus, Cody never misses a party.

01:16:14.935 --> 01:16:16.201
Speaking of which, why the hell

01:16:16.203 --> 01:16:17.370
didn't I get
an invite to this party?

01:16:17.372 --> 01:16:19.104
You were in jail!

01:16:19.106 --> 01:16:20.973
I handled the jail shit,
I just told you.

01:16:20.975 --> 01:16:22.642
Those cops are nothing, man!

01:16:29.417 --> 01:16:31.651
Oh, my God.

01:16:31.653 --> 01:16:34.954
You are actually,
completely out of your mind.

01:16:34.956 --> 01:16:36.757
Um, thanks.

01:16:50.137 --> 01:16:53.108
This is so crazy.

01:16:57.878 --> 01:17:02.013
Guys! You know you missed
half the party!

01:17:02.015 --> 01:17:03.883
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

01:17:03.885 --> 01:17:07.088
Um, just, uh...

01:17:08.422 --> 01:17:11.292
- Party!
- Let's go, let's go!

01:17:28.743 --> 01:17:30.175
Is there a problem officers?

01:17:30.177 --> 01:17:32.410
Yeah, we need to speak to
whoever owns this house.

01:17:32.412 --> 01:17:34.312
Can someone please let
Barry know that the police

01:17:34.314 --> 01:17:36.315
would like to speak to
him in front of the house?

01:17:36.317 --> 01:17:38.220
He'll be out shortly.

01:17:39.753 --> 01:17:41.954
Hello, officers.

01:17:41.956 --> 01:17:43.421
Been getting a lot
of complaints.

01:17:43.423 --> 01:17:45.426
There's a major
public disturbance going on.

01:17:46.894 --> 01:17:48.829
Do you know who I am?

01:17:51.364 --> 01:17:53.268
Mr. Black.

01:17:55.235 --> 01:17:56.802
That's what I thought.

01:17:56.804 --> 01:17:58.737
This my baby girl's party,

01:17:58.739 --> 01:18:00.906
and she can cry
as loud as she wants.

01:18:00.908 --> 01:18:03.909
Shit, I'll cry
as loud as I want!

01:18:03.911 --> 01:18:05.443
You know,
we're just gonna act like

01:18:05.445 --> 01:18:08.147
this whole thing
never even happened.

01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:10.182
Oh, hey,
can you do a quick selfie?

01:18:10.184 --> 01:18:12.287
It'd be my pleasure.

01:18:14.122 --> 01:18:16.021
You don't even have to bother
with the 911, you know.

01:18:16.023 --> 01:18:19.525
Just call me, I'll come down,
and I'll cut a bitch.

01:18:19.527 --> 01:18:22.061
You know, I'll take this
riff raff on outta here.

01:18:22.063 --> 01:18:23.461
You know what I'm saying,
pew, pew, pew!

01:18:23.463 --> 01:18:25.464
- Just like that.
- Protect and serve.

01:18:25.466 --> 01:18:27.900
- Call me!
- I will!

01:18:27.902 --> 01:18:30.238
Let's go.
All right, bye.

01:18:33.039 --> 01:18:35.206
All the time, it never fails.

01:18:35.208 --> 01:18:37.076
Do you know who I am?

01:18:49.791 --> 01:18:53.159
- What have you been doing, man?
- Man, I just had to shut down some haters outside.

01:18:53.161 --> 01:18:54.927
It's all groovy.

01:18:54.929 --> 01:18:57.530
Hey! I spent
millions of dollars on my pool,

01:18:57.532 --> 01:18:58.897
and no one's in it!

01:19:15.015 --> 01:19:18.250
Boys, how the fuck
did we get here?

01:19:18.252 --> 01:19:21.853
I just wanna say I'm sorry,
and like you know we love you.

01:19:21.855 --> 01:19:23.421
Seriously, guys,
if it wasn't for you,

01:19:23.423 --> 01:19:25.523
we wouldn't be here right now.

01:19:25.525 --> 01:19:27.526
Wait, where did Chuck go?

01:19:27.528 --> 01:19:29.197
Where did he go?

01:19:46.009 --> 01:19:51.009
