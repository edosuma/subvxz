Pittsburgh is a city
of neighborhoods,

01:37.400 --> 01:41.300
each with its own
rites and rituals,

01:41.333 --> 01:46.800
a patchwork of cultures that
took shape over a century ago.

01:46.833 --> 01:49.900
Back then, the city was a
beacon of hope and possibility

01:49.933 --> 01:51.700
for people from
all over the world,

01:51.733 --> 01:57.533
offering the promise of work,
prosperity, a new life.

01:57.567 --> 01:59.833
Pittsburgh could have been
another company town

01:59.867 --> 02:03.467
gone to beautiful ruin,

02:03.500 --> 02:06.233
but something happened.

02:06.267 --> 02:08.133
The city started
to pop up on lists

02:08.167 --> 02:11.400
of the most livable
places in America.

02:11.433 --> 02:14.300
It became attractive to a new
wave of people from elsewhere

02:14.333 --> 02:18.633
looking to reinvent themselves
and make a new world.

02:18.667 --> 02:21.333
And so we find ourselves
asking the same questions

02:21.367 --> 02:23.567

in transition.

02:23.600 --> 02:26.967
Are the new arrivals,
new, money, new ideas,

02:29.867 --> 02:31.967

Pittsburgh of the future,

from Italy,
why did they come here?

03:52.067 --> 03:54.333
Did they come here
for steel jobs? Coal?

03:54.367 --> 03:57.233
Actually, trade. I think they
came here more for the trade.

03:57.267 --> 03:58.700
Yeah.

03:58.733 --> 04:01.700
Yeah, plumbers, bricklayers,
any kind of trade like that.

04:01.733 --> 04:04.300
Some Italians said that they
were told to come over here

and they were gonna find
the roads paved with gold.

04:08.267 --> 04:10.967
They said, "They didn't tell us
we had to build them first."

04:11.000 --> 04:12.800
Yeah.

changed over the years?

04:19.500 --> 04:22.633
Still predominantly
Italian American, or...?

04:22.667 --> 04:24.300
Yeah, not as much as it was,

12:33.867 --> 12:35.467
That was really important,

12:35.500 --> 12:37.333
and we all knew
about the restaurants,

12:37.367 --> 12:39.160
whether you were in the
restaurant business or not.

12:39.167 --> 12:41.567
- Right.
- And that wasn't Pittsburgh.

12:41.600 --> 12:44.067
When I opened Dinette
in 2008, you know,

12:44.100 --> 12:46.333
I'm expecting people
like me to be coming in.

12:46.367 --> 12:49.233
I'm 29. That's who I'm
building this restaurant for,

12:49.267 --> 12:51.967
and everyone was...
56.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Yeah, my parents' age or older.

13:03.033 --> 13:05.133
You know, I thought to myself,

13:05.167 --> 13:06.333
I'm going to this neighborhood

13:06.367 --> 13:08.233
that's basically desolate.

13:08.267 --> 13:10.300
I'm gonna take this
building that's been...

13:10.333 --> 13:12.467
It's a restaurant that's been
closed for seven years,

13:12.500 --> 13:15.067
and, you know, I'm gonna
do something nice here.

13:15.100 --> 13:16.660
You know, I didn't
expect the reaction I got

13:16.667 --> 13:18.367
from the actual people
that lived around me.

13:18.400 --> 13:19.800
Right.

13:19.833 --> 13:21.467
You know,
which was not positive.

13:21.500 --> 13:23.300
They liked it the way
it was, you know?

13:23.333 --> 13:24.693
That was their life,
and then, you know,

13:24.700 --> 13:26.367
I move in and all of a sudden,

13:26.400 --> 13:28.833
I open this restaurant and
people with nice, fancy cars

13:28.867 --> 13:30.833
are taking their parking spaces,

13:30.867 --> 13:32.333
and now I'm a yuppie gentrifier.

13:32.367 --> 13:33.700
- Well.
- You know what I mean?

13:33.733 --> 13:35.133
You know, own it.

13:35.167 --> 13:37.133
Sometimes it
kind of hurts, right,

13:37.167 --> 13:39.500
as a restaurant owner
or small business owner

13:39.533 --> 13:41.900
because there are always haters
out there, and you feel like,

13:41.933 --> 13:44.500
okay, so somebody wants me
to be a small business owner,

13:44.533 --> 13:47.400
and take care of my employees,
and then also on me,

13:47.433 --> 13:49.467
they're gonna talk
about gentrification, right?

13:49.500 --> 13:51.867
Like, you're just trying
to do your thing.

13:51.900 --> 13:54.300
You're just trying
to do something good.

13:54.333 --> 13:55.667
Right.

13:55.700 --> 13:57.660
And you're trying to do it
for you, and you should.

13:57.667 --> 14:00.200
Yeah, but I don't know.
I mean, for me it's different.

14:00.233 --> 14:02.167
Like, I definitely was thinking

14:02.200 --> 14:04.067
about the neighborhood
when I did it.

14:04.100 --> 14:06.567
Like, I'm not some egomaniac
who thinks that, like,

14:06.600 --> 14:10.400
just putting out
my food is a reason, like,

14:10.433 --> 14:13.167
so everyone can enjoy
the, like, artistry of my food.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.833
That's why I'm opening
a restaurant.

14:14.867 --> 14:16.567
That's not the point.
Well, I mean,

14:16.600 --> 14:19.633
not to disagree with anything
that you just said,

14:19.667 --> 14:22.333
but, like, I didn't open
Cure in Lawrenceville

14:22.367 --> 14:24.800
because I wanted to change
the neighborhood.

14:24.833 --> 14:28.467
I honestly opened Cure
for me 100%.

14:28.500 --> 14:29.967
I was, like,
struggling professionally,

14:30.000 --> 14:31.533
struggling personally.

14:31.567 --> 14:35.133
Cure was all about
satisfying me, like, 100%.

14:35.167 --> 14:39.500
If I'm running a high-end
restaurant in Pittsburgh.

14:39.533 --> 14:42.900
Who am I employing
as porters, dishwashers?

14:42.933 --> 14:44.500
- Honestly, like, our...
- Students.

14:44.533 --> 14:46.800
Our dishwashers are...
They're white kids.

14:46.833 --> 14:48.133
- No way.
- Yeah.

14:48.167 --> 14:49.567
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,

14:49.600 --> 14:51.467
is a big, bright
shining star of an example

14:51.500 --> 14:55.500
of what blue collar America,
I think, was 100 years ago,

14:55.533 --> 14:58.300
When we're looking at,
like, who's applying,

14:58.333 --> 15:00.467
we also need to look
at neighborhoods.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.567
The topography
of Pittsburgh is such that,

15:02.600 --> 15:05.667
like, neighborhoods
are separated by...

15:05.700 --> 15:07.700
- Bridges.
- By bridges and ravines,

15:07.733 --> 15:10.000
and this sort of thing
means that, like,

15:10.033 --> 15:12.267
people stay
within their neighborhood.

15:13.733 --> 15:15.700
- Go.
- One.

15:15.733 --> 15:17.800
- Go.
- Two.

15:17.833 --> 15:19.800
- Go.
- Three.

15:25.667 --> 15:27.433
Up, two, good.

15:30.700 --> 15:32.133
Everybody's talking now

15:32.167 --> 15:34.033
about a Pittsburgh renaissance.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.900
You've got artists coming.

15:35.933 --> 15:38.233
There are new restaurants.

15:38.267 --> 15:40.567
Somebody's making money.
Yes.

15:40.600 --> 15:41.867
Money's definitely coming in.

15:41.900 --> 15:43.300
Is it lifting all boats?

15:43.333 --> 15:45.567
No. It is not.

15:45.600 --> 15:48.467
♪

15:48.500 --> 15:51.367
The new Pittsburgh
attracts new people,

15:51.400 --> 15:56.000
but it doesn't change the life

15:56.033 --> 15:58.133
for those workers

15:58.167 --> 16:01.967
who were left behind
and kind of spit out.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.533
This is the Hill District,

16:03.567 --> 16:06.133
traditionally African American.

16:06.167 --> 16:09.367
The numbers here do not
indicate a renaissance.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.800
Black homes
take in half the income

16:11.833 --> 16:14.900
of their white neighbors,
and African American youth

16:14.933 --> 16:17.233
are six times as likely
to be arrested,

16:17.267 --> 16:19.033
go through the system,

16:19.067 --> 16:22.400
from which many
can never break free.

16:22.433 --> 16:25.800
When activist Sala Udin
was growing up here,

16:25.833 --> 16:27.967
the neighborhood was thriving,

16:28.000 --> 16:31.200
the Golden Age Harlem
of Pittsburgh.

16:35.700 --> 16:39.733
They used to call this
city hell with the lid off.

16:39.767 --> 16:44.467
The mills ran 24 hours a day.

16:44.500 --> 16:47.467
I grew up at a time when

16:47.500 --> 16:50.733
most adult men
in the neighborhood,

16:50.767 --> 16:52.467
in the morning,

16:52.500 --> 16:55.567
I saw them getting up
and going to work.

16:55.600 --> 16:59.500
My dad, for example,
dropped out of school,

16:59.533 --> 17:02.833
but was still able to find work

17:02.867 --> 17:06.833
that paid enough
to raise a family.

17:06.867 --> 17:08.467
My mother had 12 children.

17:08.500 --> 17:12.233
And your dad was able
to raise 12 kids on that.

17:12.267 --> 17:13.700
- That's right.
- Wow.

17:13.733 --> 17:15.067
That was a very
different America.

17:15.099 --> 17:17.099
That was
a very different America.

17:23.333 --> 17:26.032
- How you doing, Sala?
- Good, good.

17:28.567 --> 17:31.967
This is where I live.
This is where I grew up.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.867
All of this area,
this whole flat

17:33.900 --> 17:35.967
parking lot area that you see,

17:36.000 --> 17:38.467
this is where we lived.

17:38.500 --> 17:40.833
Devastation.

17:40.867 --> 17:44.233
They just completely devastated

17:44.267 --> 17:46.500
our whole neighborhood.

17:48.400 --> 17:52.533
In the 1950s, the city came up

17:52.567 --> 17:54.967
with a plan to revitalize
the Hill District

17:55.000 --> 17:57.533
by leveling large swaths of it.

17:57.567 --> 18:01.967
8,000 residents, including
Sala, were displaced,

18:02.000 --> 18:04.033
and instead of new housing,

18:04.067 --> 18:08.133
the land was used
to build a hockey arena.

18:08.167 --> 18:10.200
Difficult, painful memories

18:10.233 --> 18:13.700
of what used to be, and now,

18:13.733 --> 18:17.467
we see suburbanites coming in

18:17.500 --> 18:19.167
to have a good time,

18:19.200 --> 18:20.800
visit the Penguins.

18:20.833 --> 18:22.967
They don't live here.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.633
They just play here,

18:25.667 --> 18:29.900
and they don't know the pain

18:29.933 --> 18:34.000
that this playground...

18:36.400 --> 18:38.333
caused.

18:47.867 --> 18:51.233
What's the missing
component here?

18:51.267 --> 18:56.833
What's missing
is an economic plan

18:56.867 --> 18:59.367
that includes everybody,

18:59.400 --> 19:03.500
not just the techies
and the computer geeks,

19:03.533 --> 19:05.833
but regular people.

19:34.400 --> 19:36.000
By day,

19:36.033 --> 19:38.167
a mild-mannered
dentist in training,

19:38.200 --> 19:41.867
but at night she becomes,
well, a superhero.

19:45.033 --> 19:46.733
Brittany Baker is a star

19:46.767 --> 19:48.800
of the International
Wrestling Cartel.

19:48.833 --> 19:50.533
Britt! Britt!
Britt! Britt!

19:50.567 --> 19:52.467
Britt! Britt! Britt!
Britt! Britt!

19:52.500 --> 19:54.167
Tonight, she defends her title

19:54.200 --> 19:57.067
in a battle
of the wrestling titans.

19:57.100 --> 20:00.800
Boyfriend, Adam Cole, hopes to
win a championship of his own.

20:02.233 --> 20:03.467
Why do you think it's big here?

20:03.500 --> 20:05.067
In Pittsburgh?

20:05.100 --> 20:06.677
Yeah, what is it
about Pittsburgh that...

20:06.700 --> 20:08.533
Pittsburgh is a big
sports city in general.

20:08.567 --> 20:10.633
We have the Penguins,
the Pirates, the Steelers.

20:10.667 --> 20:12.700
They're so proud
of their sports teams.

20:12.733 --> 20:16.633
They're also very proud of
their wrestling organization.

20:16.667 --> 20:19.700
Everyone's independent.
No one's, like, contracted.

20:19.733 --> 20:23.467
You work where you want to work
and how you want to work.

20:23.500 --> 20:25.633
It's the big town,
small city vibe.

20:25.667 --> 20:28.500
So the fact that it's not
WWE is a point of pride?

20:28.533 --> 20:32.400
Yep. To me, wrestling fans
are the most passionate fans

20:32.433 --> 20:34.700
of any form of sport
or entertainment.

20:34.733 --> 20:37.133
This is awesome!

20:37.167 --> 20:40.200
I will confess to you
that I took a dim view

20:40.233 --> 20:42.500
of professional wrestling.
Oh, okay.

20:42.533 --> 20:44.067
Like, ah, it's not real,

20:44.100 --> 20:45.593
it's like there are these
outrageous characters.

20:45.600 --> 20:48.467
I don't get it at all,
and my daughter started

20:48.500 --> 20:50.467
to get really into it
with her best friend,

20:50.500 --> 20:53.033
so I got tickets
to WWE in New York.

20:53.067 --> 20:54.867
- Oh, right on.
- And I'd go in, I'm like,

20:54.900 --> 20:56.467
"I want to wear a bag on my head"

20:56.500 --> 20:57.885
because I'm, like,
really embarrassed

20:57.900 --> 20:59.167
to go to this thing.

20:59.200 --> 21:00.967
This is gonna be totally lame.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.633
Well, five minutes
into this thing,

21:03.667 --> 21:06.300
I think, this is like
the greatest show on earth.

21:06.333 --> 21:08.133
Britt! Britt! Britt!
Britt! Britt! Britt!

21:11.333 --> 21:11.833
♪

21:15.900 --> 21:19.967
It's physically very,
very demanding,

21:20.000 --> 21:23.200
and more to the point,
it's super dangerous.

21:23.233 --> 21:24.900
- Yeah, oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

21:24.933 --> 21:27.967
I mean, most wrestlers
get really busted up.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.633
Some of these pile drivers,

21:30.667 --> 21:32.967
neck cranks,

21:33.000 --> 21:35.200
body slams,

21:35.233 --> 21:37.900
you got to be...
Correct me if I'm wrong,

21:37.933 --> 21:41.467
you can get that wrong,
it's bad.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.633
Everything can be gone
in a second, yeah.

21:43.667 --> 21:46.133
Wrestling is inches
in many scenarios.

21:46.167 --> 21:47.867
Like you said, with,
like, a pile driver,

21:47.900 --> 21:49.833
if you're off
even by a little bit,

21:49.867 --> 21:51.167
that could be a broken neck.

21:51.200 --> 21:52.967
- A lot of trust.
- Yeah.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.660
Right before he's about
to go out and wrestle,

21:54.667 --> 21:56.260
I'll always grab him
and be like give him a kiss

21:56.267 --> 21:59.967
and like, "Be safe, be safe."

22:00.000 --> 22:03.400
Every aspiring wrestler,
since the great local hero

22:03.433 --> 22:06.300
Bruno Sammartino,
needs nourishment.

22:06.333 --> 22:10.133
In this case, Kielbasa,
sauerkraut, some pierogis,

22:10.167 --> 22:13.167
and a side of molten
mac and cheese.

22:13.200 --> 22:14.967
Oh, I should ask,
are you the heavy...

22:15.000 --> 22:17.667
Is it the heavy or
what's the bad guy called?

22:17.700 --> 22:18.967
The heel.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.467
- The heel.
- Yes.

22:20.500 --> 22:22.160
Are either of you the heel
or are you the...

22:22.167 --> 22:24.467
She's a big baby face.
I'm the big heel.

22:24.500 --> 22:27.033
So baby face is who
everybody wants to win.

22:27.067 --> 22:28.700
- Yes.
- You're a heel?

22:28.733 --> 22:30.233
I am.

22:30.267 --> 22:32.733
So what qualities is one
looking for in a heel?

22:32.767 --> 22:36.233
It's just being someone
that an audience member

22:36.267 --> 22:38.133
either doesn't want to be

22:38.167 --> 22:40.200
or wants to see
get their ass kicked.

22:40.233 --> 22:43.633
- So over-confident.
- Yep.

22:43.667 --> 22:45.467
- Narcissistic.
- Yep.

22:45.500 --> 22:46.733
- Sneaky.
- Uh-huh.

22:46.767 --> 22:48.300
- He's good.
- Yeah, exactly.

22:48.333 --> 22:50.133
You got it.
You could be a great heel.

22:50.167 --> 22:52.800
Yeah, you could be
a heel tomorrow, yeah.

22:52.833 --> 22:55.033
Comes naturally.

23:01.700 --> 23:04.567
Is it a sport or is it
more of a cathartic,

23:04.600 --> 23:08.667
emotional experience
because it goes beyond sport?

23:08.700 --> 23:10.333
There's nuance there.

23:10.367 --> 23:12.700
There are tortured souls
who are struggling

23:12.733 --> 23:15.033
with the good and evil
in themselves.

23:15.067 --> 23:16.967
- Wrestling is live theater.
- Right.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.567
It's sport.
It's a rock concert.

23:18.600 --> 23:20.300
It's all this stuff
wrapped into one.

23:20.333 --> 23:22.033
I think that when people realize

23:22.067 --> 23:23.700
that pro wrestling
has more in common

23:23.733 --> 23:25.467
with "Game of Thrones"
than it does UFC...

23:25.500 --> 23:27.300
- Right.
- They accept it more

23:27.333 --> 23:29.567
and they appreciate it
for what it is.

23:34.267 --> 23:38.900
Come to the Jozsa Corner
where the kolbasz is delicious.

23:38.933 --> 23:41.133
Chunky too. Tasty too.

23:41.167 --> 23:43.300
Make your belly feel so good.

23:43.333 --> 23:44.800
Everybody!

23:44.833 --> 23:47.633
Come to the Jozsa Corner.
Come to the Jozsa corner.

23:47.667 --> 23:50.067
Alexander Jozsa Bodner
fled Hungary

23:50.100 --> 23:51.833
during the Soviet Union's

23:51.867 --> 23:55.467
crushing suppression
of their revolution in 1956.

23:55.500 --> 23:58.300
- One more time...
- Come to the Jozsa Corner.

23:58.333 --> 24:00.367
At Jozsa Corner he runs,

24:00.400 --> 24:02.160
what's not really a restaurant
in the classic sense,

24:02.167 --> 24:04.667
but a house party with food.

24:04.700 --> 24:08.033
Classics from the old country
like chicken paprikas,

24:08.067 --> 24:10.733
langos and kolbasz.

24:10.767 --> 24:12.967
Cheers.
Salut.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.633
My dining companion is part

24:14.667 --> 24:16.633
of a more recent
wave of immigrants.

24:16.667 --> 24:20.333
Jamilka Borges moved here
from Puerto Rico in 2007

24:20.367 --> 24:23.300
and began working in what
was then a restaurant scene

24:23.333 --> 24:25.467
that was just getting started.

24:32.100 --> 24:33.733
You spent your
whole life in Puerto Rico

24:33.767 --> 24:35.133
before you came here?
I did.

24:35.167 --> 24:37.733
I moved here, what,
when I was 21,

24:37.767 --> 24:40.467
and, I don't know, Pittsburgh
is, like, really unique,

24:40.500 --> 24:42.467
like in the sense that
everybody knows each other.

24:42.500 --> 24:46.133
It's such a small town that,
like, here you know everyone,

24:46.167 --> 24:48.400
and it's really easy
to make friends,

24:48.433 --> 24:49.867
and that made it easier.

24:49.900 --> 24:51.800
What about culturally?
How different?

24:51.833 --> 24:53.067
Oh, cucumber salad?

24:53.100 --> 24:54.633
- Cucumber salad.
- Beautiful.

24:54.667 --> 24:56.533
It's very much like
a really white town

24:56.567 --> 24:58.700
that you go to every
single restaurant

24:58.733 --> 25:01.833
and, like, it's white males.

25:01.867 --> 25:03.733
People not even
understanding, like,

25:03.767 --> 25:07.467
the relationship that we had
as a country with Puerto Rico.

25:07.500 --> 25:12.467
Like, "No, I don't need a green
card to work here," right?

25:12.500 --> 25:14.633
Ten years later,
she was running Spoon

25:14.667 --> 25:18.000
and getting national attention
for her Latin-influenced take

25:18.033 --> 25:20.633
on new American food.

25:20.667 --> 25:22.967
Why did you decide to stay?
I wanted to cook,

25:23.000 --> 25:24.367
which I had no clue
what that meant,

25:24.400 --> 25:26.233
and I needed to prove something,

25:26.267 --> 25:28.300
like for me, for my family,
for, like, I don't know.

25:28.333 --> 25:30.067
- Spite.
- Yeah, it's spite.

25:30.100 --> 25:31.833
It was like,
"No, like, I'm gonna do this."

25:31.867 --> 25:33.660
- That's a powerful motive.
- It was kind of like...

25:33.667 --> 25:36.133
My family had no clue
what I was going into.

25:36.167 --> 25:38.233
I still remember, like,
my grandma being like,

25:38.267 --> 25:40.167
"You're gonna be what?"

25:40.200 --> 25:42.533
I'm Puerto Rican, like,
my grandma's vision was like,

25:42.567 --> 25:44.967
"Oh, you're gonna either cook
for your husband or family

25:45.000 --> 25:47.067
or you're, like,
professional help."

25:47.100 --> 25:51.833
Certainly, when I started
in the business anyway,

25:51.867 --> 25:54.200
it was pretty much
a boys' club in the kitchen.

25:54.233 --> 25:55.800
What was it like here
when you started?

25:55.833 --> 25:57.500
Was it different here?

25:57.533 --> 26:00.500
It was, and I think, to a
certain degree, it still is.

26:00.533 --> 26:03.500
Like, this mushroom guy,
he comes every year.

26:03.533 --> 26:05.800
He knows who I am
and I'm like the only person,

26:05.833 --> 26:08.133
like, with a clipboard in white,

26:08.167 --> 26:10.300
and he's still like,
"Can I talk to the chef?"

26:10.333 --> 26:11.367
Right.

26:11.400 --> 26:13.000
That's me.
I'm on the side of...

26:13.033 --> 26:14.833
Let me smack you
and write "chef"

26:14.867 --> 26:16.467
backwards on your forehead.

26:19.767 --> 26:22.700
So who's coming to town now?

26:22.733 --> 26:24.567
I mean, who are your customers?

26:24.600 --> 26:28.300
So, you know, last three or
four years we have been having,

26:28.333 --> 26:31.867
like, new move of,
like, 30's, like young,

26:31.900 --> 26:33.500
mid 20-something
to 30-something, like,

26:33.533 --> 26:35.900
engineers and, like techies
moving into town.

26:35.933 --> 26:39.700
- That's good for business.
- Sure, but...

26:39.733 --> 26:41.200
You seem wary about the future.

26:41.233 --> 26:42.800
Do you think this is a bubble

26:42.833 --> 26:44.467
or do you think
it's gonna keep growing?

26:44.500 --> 26:46.193
I think I'm actually like
a really positive person

26:46.200 --> 26:48.167
and I'm like, I want...

26:48.200 --> 26:53.067
I want it to work, I just...
Yes, I am definitely worried.

26:53.100 --> 26:57.233
I think that the city
is growing fast,

26:57.267 --> 26:59.000
and, like, I don't know

26:59.033 --> 27:01.267
if we're able
to keep up with it.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.300
This is not my town anymore.

27:24.333 --> 27:26.467
When I was young and growing up,

27:26.500 --> 27:28.800
I was shooting craps
and chased by the cops.

27:28.833 --> 27:30.967
Now I'm sitting around
with a bunch of people

27:31.000 --> 27:32.800
talking about hops.

27:32.833 --> 27:35.333
This is not my town anymore.

27:38.600 --> 27:41.467
The town of Braddock
is where Andrew Carnegie

27:41.500 --> 27:45.233
built his first steel mill
in the 1870s.

27:45.267 --> 27:47.300
By the turn of the century,

27:47.333 --> 27:48.733
he bought another one
up the river,

27:48.767 --> 27:52.133
the Carrie Furnaces.

27:52.167 --> 27:54.367
These smoke and fire
belching behemoths

27:54.400 --> 27:56.467
were the heart of
a steel-producing industry

27:56.500 --> 27:59.400
that spread throughout
the Monongahela River Valley,

27:59.433 --> 28:01.800
generating wealth
and power to the few

28:01.833 --> 28:05.800
and a decent living to many.

28:05.833 --> 28:09.300
When tomorrow comes, you'll
have a better so-called today.

28:09.333 --> 28:11.033
So you're thinking of the day

28:11.067 --> 28:14.467
will decide your destiny
and your future.

28:14.500 --> 28:16.700
And if you don't succeed,
it's your own fault

28:16.733 --> 28:19.700
because you didn't take
control of what you think

28:19.733 --> 28:22.633
because what you think
is gonna decide what you do,

28:22.667 --> 28:25.700
and what you do is gonna
decide what you get.

28:25.733 --> 28:28.233
Now, that's all for today,
folks. Let's go to work.

28:28.267 --> 28:30.633
For the last 40 years,

28:30.667 --> 28:32.633
Tony Buba has been
making documentaries

28:32.667 --> 28:34.733
about the fate of the
working class in Braddock.

28:34.767 --> 28:37.133
He grew up here
during the town's heyday,

28:37.167 --> 28:38.633
the '40s and '50s,

28:38.667 --> 28:41.300
before leaving to go
to film school.

28:41.333 --> 28:43.033
Why did you come back?
Why did I come back?

28:43.067 --> 28:45.800
I was gone from
about '68 to about '75.

28:45.833 --> 28:47.233
They I came home,

28:47.267 --> 28:49.800
and I saw everything's
decaying even worse,

28:49.833 --> 28:51.333
and the people I hung out with,

28:51.367 --> 28:53.567
like there's Sal Carulli
and other guys,

28:53.600 --> 28:55.067
they were these
really characters.

28:55.100 --> 28:57.067
Chico pushed the button me.

28:57.100 --> 28:58.633
No one' gonna push
the button on me.

28:58.667 --> 29:00.367
Nobody. Nobody.

29:00.400 --> 29:02.400
The only guy that can do
that is that guy up there,

29:02.433 --> 29:06.567
J.C.
J. C., my man.

29:06.600 --> 29:08.467
There's a lot of
World War II people

29:08.500 --> 29:10.633
that were starting to die off,
and I was really like,

29:10.667 --> 29:12.967
"This is gonna disappear,
and the industry's going away."

29:13.000 --> 29:15.967
So I didn't know what else
to make films about,

29:16.000 --> 29:18.633
so I just started documentaries
and I just wanted to capture,

29:18.667 --> 29:20.667
and get some of these
characters on film,

29:20.700 --> 29:22.167
and make them mythical.

29:22.200 --> 29:23.633
But you stayed in Braddock

29:23.667 --> 29:25.000
because Braddock
was your subject.

29:25.033 --> 29:26.160
It's my subject, and I thought,

29:26.167 --> 29:27.733
"Okay, what if I move?"

29:27.767 --> 29:29.393
If I move to Los Angeles,
maybe I can get a job

29:29.400 --> 29:31.200
in the industry,
but what if I get stuck

29:31.233 --> 29:32.926
working on "Love Boat"
my whole life, you know?

29:32.933 --> 29:34.360
Yeah, that would be
the nightmare scenario.

29:34.367 --> 29:35.333
Yeah, exactly.

29:35.367 --> 29:37.967
In the mid-20th century,

29:38.000 --> 29:40.333
the population
of Braddock was 20,000.

29:40.367 --> 29:42.867
Today it's down to 2,000,

29:42.900 --> 29:46.467
more than 40% of whom
live below the poverty line.

29:46.500 --> 29:48.700
This is where I went
to Junior High School.

29:48.733 --> 29:51.067
- Closed?
- Yeah, closed.

29:51.100 --> 29:53.533
So who's moving in?
Is anyone moving in now?

29:53.567 --> 29:55.567
Nobody's moving
into Pittsburgh, actually.

29:55.600 --> 29:57.093
Well, I thought you had
all these tech jobs

29:57.100 --> 29:58.900
coming in, Google and Uber.

29:58.933 --> 30:01.467
You know, all that stuff is
coming in but they sort of do

30:01.500 --> 30:04.133
this upbeat bullshit
about people coming in.

30:04.167 --> 30:07.533
If it wasn't for some
30,000 immigrants,

30:07.567 --> 30:11.967
the population would have
dropped even more.

30:12.000 --> 30:15.133
- Now, this is the brewer.
- Right.

30:15.167 --> 30:17.633
Yeah, they've done
really well with this place.

30:17.667 --> 30:20.233
Well, who drinks there?
I mean, are they locals?

30:20.267 --> 30:22.567
No, no, it's too expensive,
$7.00 a beer.

30:22.600 --> 30:25.733
There's people coming in
on bicycles, grabbing a beer.

30:25.767 --> 30:27.700
Getting something
from the taco truck,

30:27.733 --> 30:29.333
and they want to sort have

30:29.367 --> 30:31.033
like, a "The Wire"
experience, you know.

30:31.067 --> 30:32.833
"Yeah, I was in Braddock
having a beer."

30:32.867 --> 30:35.200
You know, sort of giving
a little cred to their lives.

30:35.233 --> 30:37.567
I don't know,
and it's all sort of,

30:37.600 --> 30:41.133
you know, white businesses.

30:41.167 --> 30:43.800
In 1988, the state
classified Braddock

30:43.833 --> 30:45.700
as financially distressed,

30:45.733 --> 30:48.300
their term for bankruptcy,

30:48.333 --> 30:51.167
a status it still holds today.

30:51.200 --> 30:52.970
This is still working.
This is still working.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.233
It's the only plant working
in the whole Mon Valley.

30:55.267 --> 30:57.967
This is where my dad
worked for 46 years.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.867
The last time I was there
it looked like a spaceship,

31:00.900 --> 31:02.633
it was all so modernized.

31:02.667 --> 31:05.700
There's probably 500 people
doing the work of, you know,

31:05.733 --> 31:09.233
when my dad was there, 5,000.

31:09.267 --> 31:11.000
So what do you think
it's gonna take?

31:11.033 --> 31:13.467
Or do you think
it's just gonna die?

31:13.500 --> 31:15.467
I think we're in the last
stages of capitalism,

31:15.500 --> 31:17.160
because this is...
You're talking socialism?

31:17.167 --> 31:18.900
Yeah, yeah, I'm talking
socialism, yeah.

31:18.933 --> 31:21.400
When the magical workers'
paradise arrives,

31:21.433 --> 31:23.500
will Braddock be here?
Will Braddock be here?

31:23.533 --> 31:26.233
I wish there was, like,
a simple answer to all this.

31:28.667 --> 31:30.733
I'll die before I actually
see what happens.

31:30.767 --> 31:33.567
I'm not gonna know the story,
and it really bothers me.

31:33.600 --> 31:36.033
It's the only thing I hate
about the thought of dying

31:36.067 --> 31:38.367
is that I don't know
what the story's gonna be.

31:50.267 --> 31:53.567
Braddock, Pennsylvania,
sustained a real traumatic

31:53.600 --> 31:55.667
unraveling that was common

31:55.700 --> 31:58.367
in Rust Belt
communities and towns,

31:58.400 --> 32:01.567
but ours was a particularly
severe example of that.

32:01.600 --> 32:04.067
- Average income?
- We're around $20,000, so...

32:04.100 --> 32:06.900
- Which is...
- Which is substantially below

32:06.933 --> 32:08.833
the Pennsylvania average.

32:08.867 --> 32:10.826
Yeah, I'll have mothers
that will call me on a Monday,

32:10.833 --> 32:12.467
and, you know, by Friday

32:12.500 --> 32:14.393
they're gonna be out of food
to feed their three kids,

32:14.400 --> 32:16.367
and this happens
quite regularly.

32:16.400 --> 32:19.400
John Fetterman does not look
like your typical mayor,

32:19.433 --> 32:20.967
and he isn't.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.633
He came to Braddock in 2001

32:22.667 --> 32:24.967
to help at-risk youth
get their GEDs,

32:25.000 --> 32:27.800
and ran for office here in one
of the most depressed towns

32:27.833 --> 32:29.833
in the state four years later.

32:29.867 --> 32:33.567
His wife, Gisele, is from Rio,
and she runs a nonprofit

32:33.600 --> 32:36.367
that provides food and
essential supplies for more

32:36.400 --> 32:38.633
than 1,500 families each month.

32:38.667 --> 32:42.167
A lot of people
in this country are angry.

32:42.200 --> 32:44.467
They feel that their
anger has not been

32:44.500 --> 32:45.967
acknowledged in any way,

32:46.000 --> 32:47.308
and frankly,
I think they're right.

32:47.333 --> 32:49.800
- Yep.
- There is a sense,

32:49.833 --> 32:52.467
particularly in rural,
white America,

32:52.500 --> 32:55.800
of aggrievement
that nobody's listening,

32:55.833 --> 32:57.633
nobody's caring about them.

32:57.667 --> 33:00.033
I mean, Western PA
played a pivotal role

33:00.067 --> 33:01.833
in helping elect Donald Trump,

33:01.867 --> 33:03.367
and he turned Pennsylvania red

33:03.400 --> 33:05.300
for the first time since '88,

33:05.333 --> 33:07.467
and did it so with a margin
of about 44,000 people,

33:07.500 --> 33:09.567
a lot of whom,
as you referenced,

33:09.600 --> 33:11.300
are disaffected Democrats.

33:11.333 --> 33:13.300
Somebody phrased it to me
where it's like,

33:13.333 --> 33:15.133
"If the economy's
not gonna work for me,

33:15.167 --> 33:17.167
then I don't want it
to work for anybody."

33:17.200 --> 33:20.833
How does that manifest itself
on a local basis for you?

33:20.867 --> 33:22.333
It's an honor to be involved,

33:22.367 --> 33:25.633
and I hope whoever it is
that's next

33:25.667 --> 33:27.633
realizes that you need

33:27.667 --> 33:30.367
to go outside your community's
borders to bring help in,

33:30.400 --> 33:32.367
and that's what
I've tried to do.

33:32.400 --> 33:34.733
That means people like
four-time Super Bowl champion,

33:34.767 --> 33:36.333
Franco Harris,

33:36.367 --> 33:38.167
and if you're wondering
how he could help,

33:38.200 --> 33:41.133
you might be surprised
by the answer.

33:41.167 --> 33:44.167
Franco and I hope to be
growing medical marijuana

33:44.200 --> 33:46.300
about a block from here.
We put in an application

33:46.333 --> 33:50.167
for a large grow facility
here in our community,

33:50.200 --> 33:52.533
which would be a real
economic shot in the arm,

33:52.567 --> 33:53.967
and it's been a real honor

33:54.000 --> 33:56.167
to partner with someone
like Franco.

33:56.200 --> 33:58.133
Why is this a cause for you?

33:58.167 --> 34:00.133
I'm a believer
in medical marijuana

34:00.167 --> 34:02.000
because of pain management,

34:02.033 --> 34:06.067
and I run into many ex-players

34:06.100 --> 34:07.800
who deal with pain management,

34:07.833 --> 34:10.967
and, right now, the
alternatives don't look good,

34:11.000 --> 34:12.500
and we have a lot of problems

34:12.533 --> 34:13.926
with the alternatives
that they've had so.

34:13.933 --> 34:15.632
There's no doubt about that.

34:15.667 --> 34:18.233
Western PA's been ravaged
by the opioid crisis,

34:18.266 --> 34:22.800
and it positions us
for the eventual legalization

34:22.833 --> 34:24.833
of marijuana and...

34:24.867 --> 34:26.900
It would also pull
Braddock out of Act 47,

34:26.933 --> 34:29.533
so we would no longer
be fiscally bankrupt.

34:32.433 --> 34:34.033
Braddock lost its initial bid

34:34.067 --> 34:35.900
for a medical marijuana license,

34:35.933 --> 34:37.467
but there are a few other

34:37.500 --> 34:39.333
madcap entrepreneurial
efforts in town,

34:39.367 --> 34:42.199
lone dreamers with a plan.

34:42.233 --> 34:45.800
One such dreamer
is chef Kevin Sousa.

34:45.833 --> 34:48.467
Kevin was the first
of a new generation of chefs

34:48.500 --> 34:50.533
to bring national
attention to Pittsburgh

34:50.567 --> 34:52.132
when he opened his restaurant,

34:52.167 --> 34:55.333
Salt of the Earth, in 2010.

34:55.367 --> 34:57.033
What are we looking at
here, Chef?

34:57.067 --> 34:59.033
- All right, so...
- Beautiful.

34:59.067 --> 35:02.700
We are landlocked,
so seafood is tough.

35:02.733 --> 35:05.967
This is Lake Erie Walleye Pike,

35:06.000 --> 35:09.067
some new potatoes from the farm,

35:09.100 --> 35:10.733
some of the crackling
from the fish,

35:10.767 --> 35:14.167
took the skin crisped it up,
it's nice and crunchy,

35:14.200 --> 35:16.633
and then just a lot
of little farm herbs.

35:16.667 --> 35:18.367
Now, after some bumps
in the road,

35:18.400 --> 35:20.467
he's improbably turning
this building,

35:20.500 --> 35:23.467
a former Chevy dealership,
into his latest restaurant,

35:23.500 --> 35:25.367
Superior Motors.

35:25.400 --> 35:27.800
Opening night is less
than a month away.

35:27.833 --> 35:29.400
Do I have to eat this?

35:29.433 --> 35:31.967
I mean, it's too pretty.
It's too pretty to eat. Jeez.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.093
The fish is amazing, by the way.

35:33.100 --> 35:34.467
Oh, thank you very much.

35:34.500 --> 35:35.693
Where were you born and raised?

35:35.700 --> 35:37.233
McKees Rocks.

35:37.267 --> 35:38.883
- You're close to your roots.
- Yeah, yeah,

35:38.900 --> 35:42.067
in locality and in spirit.

35:42.100 --> 35:44.133
Is the restaurant
business any... I mean,

35:44.167 --> 35:45.826
'cause I know, you know,
it's been bumpy for you.

35:45.833 --> 35:47.167
It has.

35:47.200 --> 35:48.700
You over-expanded
or over-extended?

35:48.733 --> 35:50.333
Over-expanded with no capital.

35:50.367 --> 35:52.333
I just thought we were
gonna open the doors

35:52.367 --> 35:54.200
and everyone was gonna
go apeshit

35:54.233 --> 35:57.300
for whatever it is
that I served, and I learned.

35:57.333 --> 35:59.967
As serendipity would have it,
I met John.

36:00.000 --> 36:03.233
Asked if I'd be interested in
going for a walk in Braddock.

36:03.267 --> 36:06.200
Came out to Braddock.
Fell in love.

36:06.233 --> 36:07.800
- With Braddock, not me.
- With Braddock.

36:09.867 --> 36:12.300
You know, it reminded me of
McKees Rocks, and McKees Rocks,

36:12.333 --> 36:15.967
you know, has suffered much in
the same way as Braddock has.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.500
Kevin says he has ambitions

36:18.533 --> 36:20.667
that go beyond turning a profit.

36:20.700 --> 36:23.500
His restaurant hopes to
provide tuition-free training,

36:23.533 --> 36:25.733
and they're partnering
with a local urban farm

36:25.767 --> 36:28.200
that employs high school
students to grow produce

36:28.233 --> 36:30.567
in the shadows
of the old steel mill.

36:30.600 --> 36:33.533
And though we are talking
a swank, high-end restaurant

36:33.567 --> 36:36.300
designed to attract the monied
classes from out of town,

36:36.333 --> 36:40.467
locals will be offered
steeply discounted meals.

36:40.500 --> 36:44.000
So this is beautiful,
grass-fed beef short ribs

36:44.033 --> 36:48.467
sitting on a bed of lightly
blanched milkweed buds.

36:48.500 --> 36:52.700
On top, a bunch of
over-wintered sun choke chips.

36:52.733 --> 36:54.233
- Nice.
- Awesome.

36:54.267 --> 36:56.500
That's the compliment
I was looking for.

36:56.533 --> 37:00.067
I was trying to work
that one out.

37:00.100 --> 37:02.467
So what happens
if everything works out

37:02.500 --> 37:04.233
the way you want it to,

37:04.267 --> 37:08.367
meaning people are driving
from all over the state,

37:18.000 --> 37:19.567

37:24.500 --> 37:26.033
No, not yet.

proof, essentially.

off this mortal coil,
