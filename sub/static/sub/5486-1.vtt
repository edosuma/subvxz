09:12.175 --> 09:13.408
Hey...

09:13.409 --> 09:15.410
How would you describe
our relationship?

09:15.411 --> 09:17.045
Bad.

09:17.046 --> 09:19.648
Yeah, frosty, hostile, not good.

09:19.649 --> 09:21.450
- Did I say "bad"?
- Why?

09:21.451 --> 09:22.584
Because I have to work with you

09:22.585 --> 09:23.585
and I don't think
you're a good person.

09:23.586 --> 09:24.853
What are you talking about?

09:24.854 --> 09:26.488
I'm a great person.

09:26.489 --> 09:28.156
I go to church with
you every single week.

09:28.157 --> 09:29.825
I'm not even Catholic.
It's boring as hell

09:29.826 --> 09:31.960
to wait in a long line
for one stupid chip.

09:31.961 --> 09:33.061
What are you talking about?

09:33.062 --> 09:34.496
We haven't talked in,
like, two years.

09:34.497 --> 09:36.098
You didn't even invite
me to your wedding.

09:36.099 --> 09:37.599
I didn't invite
you to my wedding?

09:37.600 --> 09:38.600
Not that I'd invite you to mine.

09:38.601 --> 09:39.734
Wait, are you getting married?

09:39.735 --> 09:41.470
No, never.

09:41.471 --> 09:43.505
I would never make
that mistake again.

09:43.506 --> 09:47.142
Ah, yes,
there is the Danny I know.

09:47.143 --> 09:49.011
Sorry I wasted your time.

09:52.381 --> 09:54.850
Okay, universe,
I guess the lesson here is that,

09:54.851 --> 09:58.220
without me, Danny Castellano
is a miserable meatball.

09:58.221 --> 10:00.388
But without him,
my life is much better.

10:00.389 --> 10:02.224
Might as well enjoy it.

10:02.225 --> 10:03.892
Morgan! Get me my lunch.

10:03.893 --> 10:07.028
I'm not pregnant,
so sushi and a 40 please.

10:07.029 --> 10:08.930
So just your regular lunch?

10:08.931 --> 10:12.067
Morgan... What happened to you?

10:12.068 --> 10:13.668
Why are you in a wheelchair?

10:13.669 --> 10:14.803
[sighs]

10:14.804 --> 10:16.738
I was walking down
the street with Dr. C.

10:16.739 --> 10:19.708
There was a lot of traffic,
and it was raining a little.

10:19.709 --> 10:21.409
[crying]

10:21.410 --> 10:23.011
And I stepped on the curb,

10:23.012 --> 10:25.180
and Dr. C turned to me and said,

10:25.181 --> 10:26.448
"Your shoes are too squeaky.

10:26.449 --> 10:29.085
I want you to spend the rest
of the day in a wheelchair."

10:31.287 --> 10:33.188
- What?
- I'm so embarrassed.

10:33.189 --> 10:34.956
I feel like such a fool.

10:34.957 --> 10:35.924
[shoes squeaking]

10:35.925 --> 10:37.659
Actually,
I found them in a field.

10:37.660 --> 10:40.762
It's like a high-pitched...

10:40.763 --> 10:42.397
- Get off!
- Ooh, ahh, ahh.

10:42.398 --> 10:44.633
Does Mindy know you're
finding her a husband?

10:44.634 --> 10:46.902
No, but since the father
won't step up to the plate,

10:46.903 --> 10:48.069
like Manny Ramirez,

10:48.070 --> 10:49.604
we have to take the ball
and run with it,

10:49.605 --> 10:50.906
like Rob Gronkowski.

10:50.907 --> 10:53.475
Come on, an arranged marriage?

10:53.476 --> 10:57.245
That's so... that's so medieval.

10:57.246 --> 11:00.015
We were an arranged marriage.

11:00.016 --> 11:02.150
You were?

11:02.151 --> 11:03.818
But you... you...
you must have known each other

11:03.819 --> 11:05.287
a little bit before, right?

11:05.288 --> 11:07.189
Like seen each other
at the festivals?

11:07.190 --> 11:10.659
You know, when you push the...
the lantern in the water.

11:10.660 --> 11:12.794
- That's Japan.
- That's Japan.

11:12.795 --> 11:14.896
The first time I saw her

11:14.897 --> 11:18.533
was when I lifted her
veil on our wedding day.

11:18.534 --> 11:21.036
It was the happiest
day of our lives.

11:21.037 --> 11:22.704
[inhales deeply]

11:22.705 --> 11:23.972
All right.

11:23.973 --> 11:26.041
All right,
let's take a look at these guys.

11:26.042 --> 11:27.577
Yay, let's do it.

11:32.548 --> 11:33.748
[tap at door]

11:33.749 --> 11:35.383
Hello, Mindy. You look happy.

11:35.384 --> 11:37.018
Let me guess,

11:37.019 --> 11:39.854
there's a new pop song
out celebrating butt size.

11:39.855 --> 11:41.656
Jason Derulo's
"Big Ol' Cheekies"

11:41.657 --> 11:43.258
is the jam of the season,

11:43.259 --> 11:47.195
and I am happy because
my life is so great.

11:47.196 --> 11:48.196
What do you want?

11:48.197 --> 11:50.098
Oh, nothing, I was just...

11:50.099 --> 11:51.666
missing the smell of
your dandruff shampoo.

11:51.667 --> 11:53.301
Oh, my God!

11:53.302 --> 11:55.136
Don't sniff me, you pedo.

11:55.137 --> 11:57.205
You did not call me
a pedo on Thursday.

11:57.206 --> 11:59.307
Well, actually you did,

11:59.308 --> 12:01.376
but it was in a fun
role-playing context.

12:01.377 --> 12:03.778
Role-playing...

12:03.779 --> 12:05.513
Oh, my God.

12:05.514 --> 12:07.950
Are we sleeping together?

12:12.355 --> 12:13.355
I'm not sleeping with you.

12:13.356 --> 12:14.422
I would never cheat on Danny.

12:14.423 --> 12:17.125
I mean, my husband Mitt.

12:17.126 --> 12:18.660
Matt. Whoever... this person...

12:18.661 --> 12:19.894
Damn it.

12:19.895 --> 12:20.929
I thought this
reality was better.

12:20.930 --> 12:22.230
Well, Mindy, I like to think

12:22.231 --> 12:24.266
that I exist in multiple
realities as well.

12:24.267 --> 12:26.801
However, in this one, I can tell
we are not going to have sex,

12:26.802 --> 12:30.338
so... I'm gonna go.

12:30.339 --> 12:32.707
What's going on with me?
I'm not a cheater.

12:32.708 --> 12:34.876
The only thing I've ever
cheated on was my vision test,

12:34.877 --> 12:36.511
and that was a victimless crime.

12:36.512 --> 12:38.246
[thud] Ow!

12:38.247 --> 12:39.314
Damn it.

12:39.315 --> 12:40.615
Why is there a chair here?

12:40.616 --> 12:42.584
There's like a million
chairs in this room!

12:42.585 --> 12:44.252
Danny can't be right about me.

12:44.253 --> 12:47.188
I have to confess to Matt,
because I'm a good person.

12:47.189 --> 12:48.790
And if he wants to
break up with me,

12:48.791 --> 12:50.726
I'll cash out with
half his money.

12:52.028 --> 12:53.662
Ooh, a dentist.

12:53.663 --> 12:55.063
They can talk about
being doctors.

12:55.064 --> 12:56.064
Fake doctor.

12:56.065 --> 12:57.599
What do you think, Danny?

12:57.600 --> 12:59.868
He is a decent man.
Will Mindy like him?

12:59.869 --> 13:02.304
Makes a mid five figures,
doesn't drink,

13:02.305 --> 13:04.172
listens to jazz.
I hope he likes the outdoors,

13:04.173 --> 13:05.807
'cause Mindy's gonna push
him right off a bridge.

13:05.808 --> 13:07.542
Next.

13:07.543 --> 13:08.943
Danny,
you haven't seemed to like

13:08.944 --> 13:10.045
any of these gentlemen.

13:10.046 --> 13:11.613
This is Mindy we're
talking about.

13:11.614 --> 13:13.648
Is there a binder of
white NBA players?

13:13.649 --> 13:15.817
Our daughter is
a 35-year-old pregnant woman

13:15.818 --> 13:17.152
with a Bart Simpson tattoo.

13:17.153 --> 13:18.820
If one of these
men will marry her,

13:18.821 --> 13:19.921
who are we to say no?

13:19.922 --> 13:21.723
Oh, maybe Danny's right.

13:21.724 --> 13:23.258
Maybe this is a bad idea,

13:23.259 --> 13:25.660
like Boston hosting
the Olympics.

13:25.661 --> 13:27.729
Mindy is too particular
for arranged marriage.

13:27.730 --> 13:29.831
Which raises the question...

13:29.832 --> 13:33.535
maybe, just maybe,
the fault isn't with Mindy,

13:33.536 --> 13:36.471
but with the institution
of marriage itself.

13:36.472 --> 13:38.674
Get out of my way!
English, English!

13:40.176 --> 13:42.811
I am Morgan of House Tookers.

13:42.812 --> 13:44.546
Both: Morgan!

13:44.547 --> 13:46.348
Finally we are together,

13:46.349 --> 13:48.249
like Peter Lawford
and Joey Bishop.

13:48.250 --> 13:49.317
You framed it.

13:49.318 --> 13:50.485
Morgan, what are you doing here?

13:50.486 --> 13:51.619
Thank God you're here.

13:51.620 --> 13:52.854
I've been looking
all over for you.

13:52.855 --> 13:55.457
I went to Pakistan first.
Big mistake.

13:55.458 --> 13:56.858
The Taliban tried
to recruit me...

13:56.859 --> 13:58.660
Hey, it's great to see you.
Can I talk to you?

13:58.661 --> 14:00.428
No one's ever said
that to me before.

14:00.429 --> 14:01.896
- Okay.
- Ah, what'd they say?

14:01.897 --> 14:03.565
Did you ask them yet?
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

14:03.566 --> 14:05.834
- Shh, keep your voice down.
- [whispers] Ow!

14:05.835 --> 14:07.669
Hey, man, how 'bout a hello?

14:07.670 --> 14:09.037
[whispering] How
the hell did you find me?

14:09.038 --> 14:11.239
Cousin Lou used
to be a detective.

14:11.240 --> 14:12.240
In a porno.

14:12.241 --> 14:13.375
Right now, they're trying

14:13.376 --> 14:15.577
to push Mindy into
an arranged marriage.

14:15.578 --> 14:16.745
In there?

14:16.746 --> 14:18.813
They got a whole
binder full of losers.

14:18.814 --> 14:21.049
Oh, is it "The Big Book
of American Losers"?

14:21.050 --> 14:23.051
I'm on page 275.

14:23.052 --> 14:25.687
Did you ask for Dr. L's hand?
What did they say?

14:25.688 --> 14:26.988
No, I'm not doing that, okay?

14:26.989 --> 14:29.557
I came here to tell
them I love her,

14:29.558 --> 14:30.959
but I'm not built for marriage.

14:30.960 --> 14:32.160
Okay, no, no, I'm sorry,

14:32.161 --> 14:34.662
I did not use all of
Dr. L's Marlboro points

14:34.663 --> 14:36.364
to fly halfway across the globe,

14:36.365 --> 14:39.000
tell the Taliban
I would "think about it,"

14:39.001 --> 14:41.035
only to have you say yet again

14:41.036 --> 14:44.406
you are not gonna propose to
the woman that you knocked up.

14:44.407 --> 14:47.942
"Oh, my feelings! My qualms!

14:47.943 --> 14:49.612
I have all these qualms."

14:51.514 --> 14:53.982
Hey, babe, I have to tell
you something very important,

14:53.983 --> 14:56.251
and it's been bothering
me the whole day...

14:56.252 --> 14:58.086
Ugh! These chips are terrible.

14:58.087 --> 14:59.654
Whoa, babe,
that's a bowl of seashells.

14:59.655 --> 15:01.356
Oh.

15:01.357 --> 15:02.991
Ooh, this reminds me.

15:02.992 --> 15:04.459
I spoke to Andy,

15:04.460 --> 15:06.394
and he is so pleased
with my work on

15:06.395 --> 15:08.163
"Real Housewives: Black vs.
White,"

15:08.164 --> 15:10.231
he wants to move
forward with our show.

15:10.232 --> 15:13.401
- Our show?
- Yeah, our reality show.

15:13.402 --> 15:15.336
About you and me
and our real lives,

15:15.337 --> 15:18.473
our stresses and struggles,
as you start your own business.

15:18.474 --> 15:20.408
Wait, my fertility practice?

15:20.409 --> 15:22.110
I don't know what that is.
No, your company!

15:22.111 --> 15:23.912
Delectable Desires.

15:23.913 --> 15:26.948
Slutty girdles for
the sexually active obese.

15:26.949 --> 15:28.650
That's my company?

15:28.651 --> 15:31.519
Okay, I'm sure my parents are
gonna be very proud about that.

15:31.520 --> 15:33.054
No, no, just...
please, Matt, stop.

15:33.055 --> 15:34.856
- I have to tell you something.
- Of course.

15:34.857 --> 15:36.558
Babe, if you can
confess to me that

15:36.559 --> 15:38.393
you wrote a love
letter to Mel Gibson,

15:38.394 --> 15:41.029
you can tell me anything.

15:41.030 --> 15:42.363
I slept with someone else.

15:42.364 --> 15:43.898
And I don't know why I did it,

15:43.899 --> 15:46.568
but I promise,
I'm not that kind of person.

15:46.569 --> 15:49.370
Oh, that's it?
That's the confession?

15:49.371 --> 15:51.005
Yeah.

15:51.006 --> 15:53.741
Well, babe, I mean... so do I.

15:53.742 --> 15:55.710
I sleep with other
people all the time.

15:55.711 --> 15:57.912
We have an open relationship.

15:57.913 --> 15:59.447
Ex-squeeze me?

15:59.448 --> 16:02.717
Danny, this is the best
Italian food I've ever eaten.

16:02.718 --> 16:06.120
Tarun, thank you
so much for the sweatshirt.

16:06.121 --> 16:07.155
I love wearing it.
I love the Sox.

16:07.156 --> 16:08.490
You're most welcome.

16:08.491 --> 16:10.458
Morgan, I can't believe
you're not eating.

16:10.459 --> 16:13.127
Honestly, it just... it looks
really disgusting to me.

16:13.128 --> 16:16.297
Like it was made with...
ulterior motives.

16:16.298 --> 16:18.199
I'm just gonna stick
to my PB and naan.

16:18.200 --> 16:19.467
I love it.

16:19.468 --> 16:22.337
You know, I only cook like
this for people I love.

16:22.338 --> 16:24.706
That is so sweet, Danny.

16:24.707 --> 16:26.608
Why can't our Mindy
find someone like you?

16:26.609 --> 16:29.310
Instead she gets taken
advantage of by some creep.

16:29.311 --> 16:30.545
Let me tell you
something about the guy

16:30.546 --> 16:32.180
who knocked up your daughter.

16:32.181 --> 16:35.216
He's literally the worst person
I've ever met in my life,

16:35.217 --> 16:37.652
and I was in a forced triple
cell with the Menendez brothers.

16:37.653 --> 16:39.387
Really?
Didn't he float you 5 grand

16:39.388 --> 16:41.489
so you could go to nurse
practitioner's school?

16:41.490 --> 16:43.791
Yeah, but did he come
to my graduation party?

16:43.792 --> 16:47.095
Nope! It was just me by myself
at the Rainforest Café.

16:47.096 --> 16:48.530
A parrot laughed at me.

16:48.531 --> 16:49.998
The waiter kept saying,
"Sir..." [doorbell rings]

16:49.999 --> 16:51.833
That's odd.
We weren't expecting anyone.

16:51.834 --> 16:53.268
Yeah, well, I was.

16:53.269 --> 16:55.303
- Who do you know in India?
- Who do I know in India?

16:55.304 --> 16:58.606
Uh, well, for one,
the dogs that stole my luggage.

16:58.607 --> 17:00.275
And for two...

17:00.276 --> 17:02.544
Dr. L's future husband.

17:02.545 --> 17:04.444
I went through this binder
and I found a real winner.

17:04.445 --> 17:06.382
- Oh, you did?
- And there he is, right there.

17:09.151 --> 17:11.286
We're in an open relationship?

You only check "open
relationship" on Facebook

relationship with chili fries."

Fassbender movie.

have a three-way with that guy,"

Yeah, but you're not
supposed to agree

who treats you like an idiot.

Sometimes I am an idiot.

How are we supposed to explain

17:37.746 --> 17:39.581
our open relationship
to our kids?

Our ki... we're not having kids!

You said you'd rather
have a recording studio

pinball machine!

You know, I just can't believe
you're doing this tonight.

17:48.857 --> 17:50.224
Of all nights!

The one night my college
roommate is in town.

I'm sorry, okay?

him for group sex, were we?

No, we were meeting him for
a nice dinner and to reminisce.

Yes, we were gonna have
a three-way with him!

Now, Sendhil, it says here

18:13.749 --> 18:15.216

18:15.217 --> 18:17.986
I myself couldn't
walk until I was 12.

Can you speak to that?

18:18.988 --> 18:21.522
Hip hop was my entire 20s.

18:21.523 --> 18:24.425
I'd say a highlight was
touring with Michael Jackson

18:24.426 --> 18:25.760

accomplished dancer.

the most lucrative career.

support a family on that?

Oh, no, I run a hedge fund.

he only looks foolish.

He's not the husband,
he's not the best friend.

19:20.849 --> 19:22.650
What's wrong with him?
Is it the way he's dressed?

19:22.651 --> 19:24.018
Or the fact that he's rich

19:24.019 --> 19:26.988

25:25.781 --> 25:27.982
Go home. Go home.

25:27.983 --> 25:29.183
You have a husband.

25:29.184 --> 25:31.152
I don't want a husband.
I want you!

25:31.153 --> 25:32.153
[thud]

25:32.154 --> 25:33.988
[hyperventilating]

25:33.989 --> 25:35.056
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
- Hey.

25:35.057 --> 25:36.957
- Hey, hey, you're okay.
- Oh, God.

25:36.958 --> 25:38.125
You're just having
a bad dream, babe.

25:38.126 --> 25:40.961
It was so awful, my God.

25:40.962 --> 25:42.329
It was like "It's
A Wonderful Life,"

25:42.330 --> 25:46.200
except it was in color
and it wasn't boring.

25:46.201 --> 25:47.868
You hated me.

25:47.869 --> 25:49.970
You were dating Freida Pinto.
She was such a bitch.

25:49.971 --> 25:51.205
What?

25:51.206 --> 25:54.141
I don't care if
we're not married.

25:54.142 --> 25:56.578
I just want to be
with you, okay?

25:58.146 --> 26:00.082
Me too.

26:04.953 --> 26:06.854
[groans]
What the hell, man?

26:06.855 --> 26:09.123
I was so worried and mad!
Where have you been?

26:09.124 --> 26:11.892
I was in India.

26:11.893 --> 26:13.561
I was with your parents.

26:13.562 --> 26:16.030
Oh, no. Did my mom sing?

26:16.031 --> 26:18.532
- A little bit, yeah.
- I'm so sorry.

26:18.533 --> 26:22.236
I told them that I love you,
but I don't believe in marriage.

26:22.237 --> 26:23.537
I know.

26:23.538 --> 26:26.407
But when two strangers can
meet on their wedding day

26:26.408 --> 26:28.242
and still be in
love 40 years later,

26:28.243 --> 26:30.177
maybe I'm wrong.

26:30.178 --> 26:33.547
I'd like to be wrong.

26:33.548 --> 26:35.984
Mindy Lahiri...

26:41.356 --> 26:45.259
Will you marry me?

26:45.260 --> 26:47.061
[laughing] Yes.

26:47.062 --> 26:49.163
Yes, yes.

26:49.164 --> 26:52.167
Oh, my God, oh, my God.
