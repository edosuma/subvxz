WEBVTT

00:25.058 --> 00:27.560
<i>I remember damage.</i>

00:27.660 --> 00:29.229
<i>And escape.</i>

00:32.532 --> 00:34.334
<i>Then...</i>

00:34.401 --> 00:38.872
<i>adrift in a stranger's galaxy</i>
<i>for a long time.</i>

00:38.938 --> 00:40.874
<i>But I'm safe now.</i>

00:40.940 --> 00:43.443
<i>I found it again.</i>

00:43.543 --> 00:45.612
<i>My home.</i>

01:18.745 --> 01:21.948
Why are we meeting today?

01:22.048 --> 01:24.384
You called me.

01:24.451 --> 01:25.952
I applied online.

01:26.052 --> 01:30.657
You called and said
I can come interview.

01:30.757 --> 01:32.325
Right.

01:49.075 --> 01:50.910
What is your strongest quality?

01:50.977 --> 01:52.679
Listening.

01:52.779 --> 01:55.615
Uh, organizing.

01:55.682 --> 01:57.150
I remember everything.

01:59.586 --> 02:02.088
I remember you now.

02:02.155 --> 02:02.755
Miranda.

02:02.822 --> 02:05.125
- From Kankakee, yes?
- Yes.

02:10.630 --> 02:11.865
I see a lot of skills,

02:11.965 --> 02:16.669
but I don't see many...jobs.

02:16.769 --> 02:20.106
Tell me about Eirene Services.

02:20.173 --> 02:22.041
My father's company.

02:22.142 --> 02:25.311
He scrubbed hulls in St. Croix.

02:25.378 --> 02:27.046
I did the books.

02:27.147 --> 02:31.484
- And your family came
to Kankakee in 1990.

02:31.551 --> 02:35.188
Yes.

02:35.288 --> 02:37.991
- Do you know the meaning
of logistics?

02:38.057 --> 02:39.792
The path things take.

02:41.494 --> 02:43.963
Not the path.

02:44.030 --> 02:46.499
The right path.

02:49.068 --> 02:50.703
Watch me now.

02:52.805 --> 02:55.408
Point of origin.

02:55.508 --> 02:58.244
End point. Okay?

02:58.344 --> 03:02.982
Logistics is not time or space.

03:03.049 --> 03:04.384
It flows.

03:04.484 --> 03:06.753
The shortest path
is six inches,

03:06.853 --> 03:10.156
but the right path

03:10.223 --> 03:13.092
starts at your point of origin,

03:13.193 --> 03:15.929
goes around your head, and
travels to Des Moines, Iowa,

03:16.029 --> 03:21.267
before hitting this end point.

03:21.367 --> 03:23.570
Des Moines, Iowa,
is hypothetical.

03:23.670 --> 03:26.005
Oh. I understand.

03:32.545 --> 03:35.615
- Where do you see yourself
in 20 years?

03:35.715 --> 03:37.684
Working for you.

03:37.750 --> 03:40.186
Or we'll all be dead.

03:42.188 --> 03:44.857
- That is funny.
Straight-faced, everything.

03:44.924 --> 03:46.693
Good.

03:46.759 --> 03:49.796
I like you.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.464
We'll all be dead.

03:58.905 --> 04:00.974
<i>You have to go Malaysia.</i>

04:01.074 --> 04:03.810
<i>I just got back to Chicago.</i>

04:03.910 --> 04:05.144
<i>I was gonna come</i>
<i>to the office later--</i>

04:05.245 --> 04:06.779
<i>- Don't.</i>
<i>Jim Felps has somehow</i>

04:06.879 --> 04:09.215
<i>landed a pitch with Sinotec.</i>

04:09.282 --> 04:12.118
<i>You need to be there</i>
<i>to run the pitch.</i>

04:12.218 --> 04:16.489
<i>I can't tell you</i>
<i>how important this is.</i>

04:16.589 --> 04:17.991
<i>Okay.</i>

04:18.091 --> 04:19.626
<i>I'll head back to O'Hare.</i>

04:19.726 --> 04:22.495
<i>I just have one thing</i>
<i>I have to do.</i>

04:29.736 --> 04:33.172
<i>- You know, until yesterday,</i>
<i>I thought that--</i>

04:33.273 --> 04:36.943
<i>I thought that I was never</i>
<i>gonna see you again.</i>

04:37.777 --> 04:40.179
Why are you here?

04:53.026 --> 04:54.360
I finished.

05:14.280 --> 05:15.848
Who's that?

05:21.054 --> 05:23.890
- He's the asshole
that ruined my life.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.292
How did you two meet?

05:48.848 --> 05:49.916
Hi.

05:50.683 --> 05:53.886
Hi.

05:53.986 --> 05:55.888
We know each other.

05:57.757 --> 05:58.891
I don't think so.

05:58.991 --> 06:00.259
Aren't you an actress?

06:00.360 --> 06:00.693
No.

06:00.760 --> 06:04.731
Ah.

06:04.831 --> 06:06.366
Ah, yeah.
No, I'm sorry.

06:06.432 --> 06:08.434
I thought--

06:18.544 --> 06:19.512
I love Chicago.

06:22.715 --> 06:24.183
It's very mellow.

06:26.018 --> 06:27.520
No, it's kind of easy.

06:27.587 --> 06:31.591
And...there's no paparazzi.

06:47.640 --> 06:50.576
Listen.

06:50.643 --> 06:52.078
I have to buy your work.

06:52.145 --> 06:53.946
- Y-you have to buy what?

06:54.046 --> 06:56.783
You're an artist, no?

06:56.883 --> 06:58.785
I'm in logistics.

06:58.885 --> 07:01.587
Oh, cool.

07:01.654 --> 07:04.157
You--
my friend is down the street,

07:04.257 --> 07:06.392
and he's having
a birthday party,

07:06.459 --> 07:08.094
and I didn't
bring him anything.

07:08.161 --> 07:10.229
Haven't seen him in ages.
He thinks I'm a flake.

07:10.296 --> 07:11.798
I-I'm not a flake.

07:11.898 --> 07:12.932
So I need to
bring him something.

07:12.999 --> 07:14.000
You know, a nice present.

07:14.100 --> 07:19.005
I don't know, like--
like that.

07:19.105 --> 07:20.440
That space map.

07:26.612 --> 07:28.481
No, I-I'll buy it.

07:32.785 --> 07:34.320
I'll pay you $1,000.

07:43.463 --> 07:44.831
It's not for sale.

07:48.367 --> 07:49.936
But you do look familiar.

07:50.002 --> 07:51.637
Right?

07:55.708 --> 07:57.877
Hey.

07:57.977 --> 08:00.213
Hey.
What if I--

08:00.313 --> 08:03.049
if I give you an interpretation
of the meaning of your work?

08:03.149 --> 08:04.884
No, thank you.

08:04.984 --> 08:07.153
- You know,
my father is a poet.

08:07.220 --> 08:09.889
And whenever he has to publish
something in a magazine,

08:09.989 --> 08:11.224
he gets the editor to give him
an interpretation,

08:11.324 --> 08:13.726
you know, to see if he gets it.

08:13.826 --> 08:17.029
And that way--that way,
they take care of it.

08:18.831 --> 08:22.568
- You haven't even
seen my work.

08:22.668 --> 08:23.636
No.

08:23.703 --> 08:25.204
No, no, but it doesn't matter,

08:25.304 --> 08:27.540
because I've got
good instincts.

08:27.640 --> 08:28.407
Can I try?

08:30.910 --> 08:32.979
Okay.

08:34.313 --> 08:39.051
The subject of your work is...

08:42.421 --> 08:43.923
A person.

08:44.023 --> 08:47.994
Not a spaceman.

08:48.060 --> 08:51.864
He's alone.

08:51.931 --> 08:54.700
Not unhappy.

08:54.767 --> 08:59.272
Adrift.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.340
A bit exhausted.

09:02.041 --> 09:05.411
But his heart is warmer

09:05.511 --> 09:07.747
and lighter

09:07.847 --> 09:10.182
than they realize...

09:10.249 --> 09:14.086
because he wears a suit...

09:14.186 --> 09:16.088
for protection.

09:27.133 --> 09:29.302
Oh, th--that's a banana.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.304
You can have it.

09:31.404 --> 09:34.473
What's your name?

09:34.574 --> 09:37.443
Miranda.

09:37.543 --> 09:39.245
I'm Arthur.

09:39.312 --> 09:41.080
Arthur!

09:41.147 --> 09:42.381
You're late.
What the fuck?

09:42.448 --> 09:44.317
Get inside already.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.586
You embossed carbuncle!

09:48.087 --> 09:51.724
That's my friend.

09:51.791 --> 09:52.892
We know each other

09:52.959 --> 09:56.996
We did a play together.
a long time ago.

09:57.096 --> 09:58.264
Do you want to come in?

10:01.000 --> 10:02.668
I got to get home.

10:05.071 --> 10:07.673
Okay.

10:07.773 --> 10:09.275
Okay.

10:10.843 --> 10:14.614
It was nice to meet you,
Miranda.

10:14.680 --> 10:16.415
Thank you for the gift.

10:38.471 --> 10:39.605
Miranda.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.778
Air and sea unite.

10:45.845 --> 10:48.447
We got more power
than the Battle of Midway.

10:48.514 --> 10:50.216
Efficiency of a moth.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.217
Great diversity.

10:51.317 --> 10:53.152
- Don't.
- Gotcha. No.

10:53.219 --> 10:55.554
I'm just glad our companies
found a way to work together.

10:55.655 --> 10:56.389
- Your company bought
our company, Jim.

10:56.489 --> 11:00.693
- Yeah, right. Let me--got it?
Okay.

11:00.793 --> 11:03.562
We want Bodhisattva.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.398
What is a Bodhisattva?

11:07.900 --> 11:09.301
I think that's Huang.

11:09.368 --> 11:10.636
- No,
they wouldn't close a deal

11:10.703 --> 11:12.405
without hearing from us first.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.840
At least I don't think so.

11:25.251 --> 11:26.318
The pitch meeting is canceled

11:26.385 --> 11:28.754
and will have
to be rescheduled.

11:28.854 --> 11:29.488
- I need to get back
to Chicago.

11:29.555 --> 11:32.658
We were told that every pitch--

11:45.771 --> 11:49.909
I don't know.
Maybe they're germophobes?

11:50.009 --> 11:51.877
What did she say?

11:51.944 --> 11:53.846
She wished us luck.

12:02.121 --> 12:03.856
Are you getting any signal?

12:03.923 --> 12:06.459
- No. Hotel Wi-Fi's still down.

12:06.559 --> 12:07.893
Oh. Great.

12:07.960 --> 12:09.528
Welcome to We're Fucked Island.

12:09.595 --> 12:12.531
- It's a peninsula.
- What?

12:12.598 --> 12:14.100
Malaysia.

12:14.200 --> 12:16.268
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Right.

12:16.368 --> 12:19.638
Ah, I left my SAT phone
in Indie.

12:19.739 --> 12:20.806
Do you have yours?

12:20.906 --> 12:23.642
Are there less people here?

12:26.612 --> 12:28.214
- I don't--I don't know.

12:32.084 --> 12:34.420
You know what, I'm gonna go see
the warehouse boys

12:34.487 --> 12:37.256
in the Showroom, see if
they know what's going on.

12:37.323 --> 12:38.958
You know those guys, right?

12:39.058 --> 12:41.293
Hank and Rabbit? Nick?

12:43.596 --> 12:46.165
Carroll?

12:46.265 --> 12:48.000
Hey, Miranda.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.735
You okay?

12:49.802 --> 12:52.671
- I'm good. I just, um--

12:52.772 --> 12:53.672
I'm gonna go
grab my SAT phone.

12:57.009 --> 13:00.412
- Okay. Hey, hit me up
for coffee later.

13:12.691 --> 13:15.161
- No closing time
for the famous, apparently.

13:15.261 --> 13:16.796
- He's talked them

13:16.862 --> 13:18.798
into staying open.

13:20.299 --> 13:22.968
Here you go, my dear.

13:23.035 --> 13:24.804
Thank you.

13:33.612 --> 13:35.014
Ah.

13:35.114 --> 13:36.615
I can't tell you
how many nights

13:36.682 --> 13:40.152
I've had
that have ended like this.

13:40.219 --> 13:41.720
Drinking with somebody
fascinating, like yourself,

13:41.821 --> 13:45.391
who Arthur acquired
three bars previous,

13:45.491 --> 13:47.293
while he talks to his fans.

13:49.962 --> 13:52.631
Maybe I acquired him.

13:59.238 --> 14:00.539
Arthur!

14:04.510 --> 14:06.512
What's that?

14:06.579 --> 14:08.581
Oh.

14:08.681 --> 14:11.984
It's a feeling.

14:12.051 --> 14:13.352
What's the feeling?

14:15.521 --> 14:17.656
Cut and run.

14:17.723 --> 14:20.392
When a squall
comes up so fast,

14:20.492 --> 14:22.995
you got to cut the anchor
and just go.

14:25.431 --> 14:28.100
My dad did it once.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.936
Sliced the rope right in front
of us with a filet knife.

14:35.407 --> 14:37.509
That feeling.

14:37.576 --> 14:40.045
- Well, now, I used to go
sailing with my grandfather.

14:40.112 --> 14:40.779
The Mouth of the Shannon.

14:40.880 --> 14:45.117
And the thought
of a sudden storm

14:45.217 --> 14:46.619
used to terrify me.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.120
I prefer the land.

14:48.220 --> 14:51.190
Two feet on the ground.

14:51.257 --> 14:52.591
- I'm sorry.
- Fuck's sake.

14:52.691 --> 14:54.627
Sorry.

14:54.727 --> 14:58.230
He's nice.
Another round?

14:58.297 --> 15:00.699
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

15:02.101 --> 15:03.636
Nice to meet you.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.604
- Which one of you
was Rosencrantz,

15:05.704 --> 15:09.074
and which one was Guildenstern?

15:09.141 --> 15:10.643
Oh, that's the joke.

15:10.743 --> 15:14.113
They're interchangeable,
like Clark and I.

15:14.213 --> 15:15.447
You can't tell?

15:16.916 --> 15:17.549
It's probably not
the same anymore,

15:17.616 --> 15:19.885
now that he's a movie star.

15:24.957 --> 15:28.160
I'm still Rosencrantz.

15:28.260 --> 15:30.095
I invented sandwiches.

15:32.932 --> 15:36.335
- You guys end up the same,
at least.

15:40.139 --> 15:42.908
You both get killed by Hamlet.

15:51.083 --> 15:52.751
Yeah, I like her.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.690
Well, fair play, Miranda.

16:11.971 --> 16:15.374
Come on, come on, come on.

16:15.474 --> 16:17.810
<i>- Miranda.</i>
- Leon?

16:17.876 --> 16:18.444
<i>- You have to get out</i>
<i>of Malaysia.</i>

16:18.510 --> 16:21.513
<i>The flu mutated.</i>

16:22.348 --> 16:23.949
Okay.

16:24.016 --> 16:26.719
The Chinese, uh,
canceled the pitch meeting.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.221
<i>Forget about the pitch!</i>

16:29.321 --> 16:31.323
<i>I need you to listen to me.</i>

16:31.390 --> 16:33.359
<i>You have six,</i>
<i>maybe seven hours</i>

16:33.459 --> 16:35.694
<i>before Malaysia is on fire.</i>

16:35.794 --> 16:38.030
- I'm not seeing anything
online.

16:38.130 --> 16:39.465
<i>You won't.</i>

16:39.531 --> 16:41.333
<i>The Asian governments</i>
<i>are taking their lead</i>

16:41.400 --> 16:42.901
<i>from the Chinese</i>
<i>and curating the internet.</i>

16:43.002 --> 16:43.569
<i>You can't trust</i>
<i>what you are seeing</i>

16:43.669 --> 16:46.038
<i>or what anyone tells you.</i>

16:48.007 --> 16:49.908
- How do I get out?
<i>- By sea.</i>

16:50.009 --> 16:51.977
<i>There's a tanker called</i>
<i>the "Robespierre"</i>

16:52.044 --> 16:52.644
<i>moored ten miles offshore.</i>

16:52.711 --> 16:55.180
<i>The captain owes me a favor.</i>

16:55.247 --> 16:56.749
<i>First, you have to get</i>
<i>from the hotel</i>

16:56.849 --> 16:58.550
<i>to the Masa Depan Docks.</i>

16:58.650 --> 17:00.185
<i>Go downstairs,</i>
<i>go to the front desk,</i>

17:00.252 --> 17:01.420
<i>and tell them your name.</i>

17:01.520 --> 17:04.423
<i>I've arranged for a package</i>
<i>to be waiting with supplies</i>

17:04.523 --> 17:06.759
<i>and information you'll need</i>
<i>to reach the "Robespierre."</i>

17:06.859 --> 17:08.560
<i>Tell no one what you know,</i>

17:08.660 --> 17:10.262
<i>and don't stop to consider</i>
<i>anyone's survival</i>

17:10.362 --> 17:11.697
<i>but your own.</i>

17:11.764 --> 17:13.732
<i>You are out in front of the</i>
<i>entire Malaysian population.</i>

17:13.832 --> 17:15.000
What about Jim Felps?

17:15.067 --> 17:17.336
<i>The captain was explicit.</i>

17:17.403 --> 17:20.439
<i>He sees anyone but you,</i>
<i>it's shoot to kill.</i>

17:22.708 --> 17:24.777
Leon?

17:24.877 --> 17:25.277
Leon.

17:34.353 --> 17:37.389
<i>You will know your end point</i>
<i>when you reach it.</i>

17:37.456 --> 17:40.125
<i>In the early days,</i>
<i>before their home is broken,</i>

17:40.225 --> 17:42.394
<i>they hardly notice me.</i>

17:42.461 --> 17:45.798
<i>It was better</i>
<i>to not be noticed.</i>

17:45.898 --> 17:48.867
<i>It is better</i>
<i>to not be noticed.</i>

17:48.934 --> 17:50.736
I think you have
a package for me?

17:50.803 --> 17:52.304
Carroll, 526.

17:58.243 --> 17:59.878
Merry Christmas.

18:00.546 --> 18:02.081
Thank you.

18:04.883 --> 18:08.053
What's the best way
to get to the Masa Depan Docks?

18:09.788 --> 18:11.457
Hey, Miranda.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.259
Excuse me.

18:17.062 --> 18:18.664
- All right, you probably heard
about the collapse

18:18.764 --> 18:19.731
of civilization, right?

18:19.798 --> 18:22.334
I'm gonna try to sneak in 18

18:22.434 --> 18:25.003
before they realize the world
isn't actually ending.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.839
What are you doing
this afternoon?

18:26.939 --> 18:29.007
Are you going
to a Christmas party?

18:29.108 --> 18:30.142
I'm escaping the flu

18:30.242 --> 18:32.478
on a tanker called
the "Robespierre."

18:33.345 --> 18:35.481
Okay.

18:35.581 --> 18:36.515
Jim, what are you gonna do?

18:41.787 --> 18:43.922
- We're gonna travel together
as a team.

18:43.989 --> 18:46.592
I'm gonna kill
with my clubs--the wedges.

18:46.658 --> 18:48.527
I die, you eat me.

18:48.627 --> 18:49.761
You die, I eat you.

18:49.828 --> 18:53.365
Come on. Come on.

18:53.465 --> 18:55.667
This is all gonna blow over
in, like, four hours,

18:55.767 --> 18:58.103
and the conference
is gonna be back on.

18:58.170 --> 19:00.038
I guarantee it.

19:00.139 --> 19:04.042
- In that case, Jim,
if we don't all die,

19:04.143 --> 19:06.545
I don't think your half
of the pitch is there yet.

19:06.645 --> 19:08.113
It's weak.

19:10.649 --> 19:12.217
Okay.

19:14.353 --> 19:17.222
I appreciate the honesty.
I'll work on it.

19:30.035 --> 19:31.069
Arthur? It's me.

19:31.170 --> 19:35.207
It's, um, 4:00 in the morning
there, I think.

19:35.307 --> 19:38.076
You're my yesterday.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.578
Hope the premiere went well.

19:43.015 --> 19:46.318
I made a mistake.

19:46.385 --> 19:47.920
Just keep yourself safe.

19:48.020 --> 19:51.156
Stay wherever you are.
I'm coming to Chicago.

19:51.223 --> 19:54.259
I'll find you.

19:54.359 --> 19:55.827
Somehow.

20:00.699 --> 20:03.068
<i>To be loved is a calamity.</i>

20:03.168 --> 20:05.571
<i>Love will try to see the words</i>
<i>before it's finished.</i>

20:05.671 --> 20:08.574
<i>"What is your job?"</i>
<i>love will ask it.</i>

20:08.674 --> 20:10.576
<i>And you will ask,</i>

20:10.676 --> 20:13.011
<i>"What is my job?"</i>

20:17.783 --> 20:21.019
- Where are we?

20:21.086 --> 20:23.722
It's my grandmother's house.

20:23.789 --> 20:25.524
I talked about myself.

20:25.591 --> 20:27.526
- Oh, yeah.
Yeah, you were very funny.

20:27.593 --> 20:29.561
Very charming.
You were telling everyone

20:29.628 --> 20:32.297
about the meaning
behind your banana paintings.

20:32.397 --> 20:33.799
I have to go.

20:33.899 --> 20:35.801
- No, no, no, no.
No, stay.

20:35.901 --> 20:38.570
Stay. Let's eat something.

20:38.637 --> 20:41.106
Come on, don't be uncivilized.

20:41.206 --> 20:43.642
So the movie is called
"Alpha and Beta."

20:43.742 --> 20:46.211
Like the alphabet.

20:46.278 --> 20:48.981
- But it's "Alpha and Beta."
- Yeah.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.550
- "Alpha/
- Beta," with a slash,

20:51.617 --> 20:54.052
'cause it's got--
you know, it's a two-hander.

20:54.119 --> 20:55.887
Do you know what
a two-hander is?

20:55.954 --> 20:58.490
I don't like movies.

20:58.590 --> 21:00.792
Me neither.

21:00.892 --> 21:03.929
Mm.
A two-hander is a story

21:03.996 --> 21:07.165
where two people
have to solve the same problem.

21:07.266 --> 21:10.669
What's their shared problem?

21:10.769 --> 21:13.772
How to rob the Pentagon

21:13.839 --> 21:16.141
and get all the plutonium
they can get.

21:16.241 --> 21:18.110
I don't know,
it's the worst script

21:18.176 --> 21:20.312
- I've ever read in my life.

21:29.087 --> 21:30.489
- Leon?
<i>- Miranda.</i>

21:30.589 --> 21:32.024
<i>What's your status?</i>

21:32.124 --> 21:34.493
I'm almost outside the docks.

21:34.593 --> 21:36.662
<i>- The "Robespierre" says</i>
<i>she'll wait another hour,</i>

21:36.762 --> 21:37.829
<i>but they're nervous.</i>

21:37.929 --> 21:40.699
<i>Have you opened the package?</i>

21:40.799 --> 21:43.368
Uh...

21:43.468 --> 21:45.203
doing it now.

21:48.106 --> 21:51.376
<i>What are you seeing?</i>

21:51.476 --> 21:53.979
A Le Creuset,

21:54.046 --> 21:58.116
with a butterfly knife,
keys, and a picture in it.

21:58.183 --> 21:58.884
<i>- That is the boat that will</i>
<i>get you from the docks</i>

21:58.984 --> 22:01.353
<i>to the "Robespierre."</i>

22:01.453 --> 22:04.122
<i>You will be at sea</i>
<i>for at least a year.</i>

22:08.327 --> 22:10.829
So both my parents are poets,

22:10.896 --> 22:13.565
and they decided that it was
a very romantic idea

22:13.665 --> 22:14.666
to go live on an island.

22:14.733 --> 22:17.536
So we went to live on
this little island for a year,

22:17.636 --> 22:18.904
called Holbox.

22:19.004 --> 22:20.138
It's an island
that's right between

22:20.205 --> 22:22.708
the Gulf of Mexico
and the Caribbean.

22:22.808 --> 22:23.842
Yeah, I've been there.

22:23.909 --> 22:25.577
My dad used to take us swimming
with the whale sharks.

22:28.347 --> 22:29.815
He wasn't a poet,

22:29.881 --> 22:32.317
but he cleaned boats
for tourists,

22:32.384 --> 22:35.020
and we sailed with no plan

22:35.087 --> 22:37.656
until I was eight years old.

22:37.723 --> 22:42.427
<i>And then Hurricane Hugo came</i>
<i>a couple years later.</i>

22:51.536 --> 22:53.772
I have to go.

22:53.872 --> 22:55.607
Okay.

23:08.019 --> 23:10.956
<i>- How close are you</i>
<i>to that person?</i>

23:11.056 --> 23:14.626
<i>Is she within six feet?</i>

23:14.726 --> 23:16.461
Stop the bus.

23:16.561 --> 23:17.896
Stop the bus!

23:52.931 --> 23:54.433
I'm here.

23:54.499 --> 23:56.668
<i>Miranda? Is that you?</i>

23:56.768 --> 23:58.837
<i>Miranda Carroll.</i>

23:58.937 --> 24:00.972
Clark?

24:01.072 --> 24:03.675
How--
how are you calling this phone?

24:03.775 --> 24:07.479
<i>- Listen, I wanted to tell you</i>
<i>this directly.</i>

24:09.681 --> 24:13.251
<i>Arthur died.</i>

24:13.318 --> 24:14.986
<i>He--I'm so sorry.</i>

24:15.086 --> 24:17.489
<i>He had a heart attack</i>
<i>onstage tonight,</i>

24:17.589 --> 24:19.624
<i>doing "Lear."</i>

24:24.362 --> 24:27.132
<i>The--the publicist set up his</i>
<i>calls to come to me,</i>

24:27.199 --> 24:28.767
<i>apparently.</i>

24:30.135 --> 24:34.039
<i>Uh, M-Miranda, I don't know</i>
<i>how much you've been in touch.</i>

24:35.874 --> 24:38.276
I shouldn't have left.

24:40.979 --> 24:43.648
Arthur.

24:43.715 --> 24:45.884
<i>- I think you should come to</i>
<i>California and live with me.</i>

24:45.984 --> 24:47.018
No.

24:47.118 --> 24:50.856
I really do have to go.

24:50.956 --> 24:53.291
- Well, we can live in
this house, then.

24:53.358 --> 24:54.993
No.

24:57.863 --> 24:59.798
Come on. Come back to bed.

24:59.865 --> 25:01.800
Ten more minutes.

25:47.512 --> 25:48.113
Miranda. Hi.

25:48.213 --> 25:50.448
I, um, wanted to tell you

25:50.549 --> 25:52.417
that I called those fucks
at "The Daily Mail,"

25:52.517 --> 25:54.953
and I told them that we were
the ones having an affair.

25:55.053 --> 25:56.421
What?

25:56.521 --> 25:57.956
Oh.

25:58.056 --> 25:59.558
You didn't see the article.

25:59.624 --> 26:01.560
It's absurd.
I mean, he's--

26:01.626 --> 26:03.395
he's not even my type.

26:03.461 --> 26:04.863
I'm sorry.

26:04.930 --> 26:07.032
I'm just dealing
with a supply chain crisis.

26:07.098 --> 26:07.933
Oh, yeah.

26:08.033 --> 26:10.201
Yeah, of course.

26:10.268 --> 26:11.803
Okay, okay.

26:11.903 --> 26:14.406
Um...

26:14.472 --> 26:17.242
I just wanted to say
that I would never do that.

26:59.117 --> 27:00.485
Hey.

27:08.960 --> 27:10.528
Not so great.

27:13.331 --> 27:16.868
I found your phone.

27:16.968 --> 27:19.204
It was laying on the grass.
I left it there.

27:26.845 --> 27:29.180
I'll come in for lunch.

27:38.490 --> 27:39.891
You don't sleep?

27:39.991 --> 27:41.559
No.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.228
No.

27:43.328 --> 27:46.031
Do you know how to sleep?

27:46.131 --> 27:47.699
I'm okay.

27:49.134 --> 27:52.037
Leon called.

27:52.137 --> 27:53.905
He wants to send me to Perth.

27:54.005 --> 27:57.208
- My theory is that
Leon doesn't exist.

28:08.520 --> 28:08.987
You've met him.

28:09.054 --> 28:11.990
Yeah.

28:12.057 --> 28:14.359
I met him.

28:17.495 --> 28:20.932
- You went away for four months
to make that movie.

28:21.032 --> 28:22.834
But I came back.

28:25.704 --> 28:28.373
But even when you're here,

28:28.440 --> 28:29.941
you're not here.

28:30.041 --> 28:32.377
You're always locked up
in that little room,

28:32.444 --> 28:33.945
all by yourself,

28:34.045 --> 28:35.547
working on things
that nobody is allowed to see.

28:35.613 --> 28:38.383
- No one can see because
I'm not--

28:38.450 --> 28:39.951
I'm not done.

28:40.051 --> 28:43.588
- I just--I don't think
you're gonna finish!

28:52.931 --> 28:57.035
I don't want to live
the wrong life and then die!

28:58.203 --> 29:01.272
Ah!

29:04.576 --> 29:07.145
My father is
the exact same way.

29:07.245 --> 29:08.613
You know,
flying first class--

29:08.713 --> 29:09.114
he demands it.

29:09.214 --> 29:10.882
And it's weird,

29:10.949 --> 29:13.818
because he used to be a member
of the Communist Party.

29:13.918 --> 29:15.653
- No!
- Yes! Right?

29:15.754 --> 29:17.455
- Tell them.

29:17.555 --> 29:20.158
- That's--that's the irony.

29:20.258 --> 29:23.661
True artists get free passes.

29:23.762 --> 29:26.931
- He is a nice man.
- Oh, well, he didn't--

29:26.998 --> 29:29.334
you're not saying
he's not nice, right?

29:29.434 --> 29:30.802
- He's not nice.
- Oh, he's not nice?

29:30.902 --> 29:32.270
- No.
- Oh, no.

29:32.337 --> 29:34.439
- I mean, yes--

29:34.506 --> 29:36.307
- How's your project going,
Miranda?

29:36.407 --> 29:38.576
When will it be finished?

29:38.643 --> 29:39.677
Uh, soon.

29:39.778 --> 29:43.148
- I'm assuming you'll publish
when it's done?

29:43.248 --> 29:45.450
No. No. Probably not.

29:46.451 --> 29:48.353
- What's the point of doing
all that work

29:48.453 --> 29:50.355
if no one's going to see it?

29:50.455 --> 29:52.524
It makes me happy.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.325
It's peaceful,

29:54.425 --> 29:57.195
spending hours working on it.

29:57.295 --> 29:58.863
It doesn't really matter
if anyone--

29:58.963 --> 30:02.200
- Don't die
without seeing Fiji.

30:02.300 --> 30:04.869
- See what?
- Oh.

30:04.969 --> 30:07.806
We just went.
It was incredible.

30:07.872 --> 30:10.375
We smoked, surfed, swam.

30:10.475 --> 30:12.777
Stunning energies.

30:12.844 --> 30:13.378
Everything changed.

30:13.478 --> 30:16.214
Ah, sounds tremendous.

30:16.314 --> 30:19.350
- No, more.
It was a...rebirth.

30:19.450 --> 30:24.222
- Mm-hmm.
But, I mean...

30:24.322 --> 30:28.326
you seem to get reborn almost
every time you leave the house.

30:30.195 --> 30:31.729
Miranda,
does that happen to you?

30:31.830 --> 30:34.332
Oh, I'm trying.

30:34.399 --> 30:35.400
Was Fiji better than Prague?

30:35.500 --> 30:36.801
Yes!

30:36.868 --> 30:39.971
Everyone,
you all must visit Praha.

30:40.038 --> 30:41.706
- You know when
you speak English,

30:41.806 --> 30:43.541
you're allowed
to call it Prague.

30:43.641 --> 30:45.510
- Hey, Clark.
- Prague.

30:45.577 --> 30:45.910
Be nice.

30:50.081 --> 30:52.050
I apologize.

30:52.684 --> 30:54.752
Who--who are you again?

30:54.853 --> 30:58.723
- I'm Clark.
I'm an old friend of Arthur's.

30:58.823 --> 31:00.992
- Clark is my friend, too.

31:01.059 --> 31:02.694
- Well, I once also aspired
to be an actor.

31:02.760 --> 31:05.263
We were Rosencrantz
and Guildenstern together

31:05.363 --> 31:07.665
back in the '90s.

31:07.732 --> 31:11.603
But alas, I wasn't good enough
in the end.

31:11.703 --> 31:13.705
- Nah, you were good.
- You say that now.

31:15.106 --> 31:16.841
But, you know,

31:16.908 --> 31:19.244
the kind thing is he--

31:19.344 --> 31:21.613
he lets me visit.

31:21.713 --> 31:24.282
Hey, babe, it's okay.

31:24.382 --> 31:29.220
I used to say "Preg,"
like the tomato sauce.

31:29.287 --> 31:31.623
- He did.

31:31.723 --> 31:32.857
It's Prego.

31:32.924 --> 31:35.059
Oh. Oh, thank you. Prego.

31:35.126 --> 31:37.462
Anytime.

31:37.562 --> 31:40.031
I went. Um...

31:40.098 --> 31:42.467
I took some art history classes
at UCLA,

31:42.567 --> 31:44.969
and I just--
I wanted to, you know,

31:45.069 --> 31:48.139
see the paintings
that I'd been reading about.

31:48.239 --> 31:50.208
Being there was like--

31:50.275 --> 31:51.643
I don't even know how to--

31:51.743 --> 31:53.544
It was like...

31:53.611 --> 31:56.080
being inside the paintings.

31:56.147 --> 31:57.916
You know?

31:57.982 --> 32:01.252
Which is a random fantasy
that I had as a kid.

32:01.319 --> 32:03.154
Stupid.

32:03.254 --> 32:04.989
- I don't think
it's stupid at all.

32:08.326 --> 32:09.727
- Have you guys seen
Miranda's work?

32:09.794 --> 32:11.229
I mean, I'm just an admirer,

32:11.296 --> 32:12.397
but I told Art
I think you are a genius.

32:12.463 --> 32:15.066
You told who?

32:15.133 --> 32:15.800
Art.

32:15.900 --> 32:18.002
Arthur.
Arthur. Your husband.

32:18.102 --> 32:22.640
He, um--he took them to the
pool house and let me see it.

32:22.740 --> 32:24.842
You guys, it is incredible.

32:24.943 --> 32:27.578
It's about this spaceman.

32:27.645 --> 32:29.981
Well, no, it's not about that.
It's about--

32:30.081 --> 32:31.849
it's about someone
who survives a tragedy

32:31.950 --> 32:35.653
and how they feel
so alienated

32:35.753 --> 32:38.022
from, you know,
all the day-to-day stuff.

32:38.122 --> 32:41.259
And it's--it's just
really profound.

32:43.461 --> 32:47.632
<i>- Love will try to see the</i>
<i>words before it's finished.</i>

32:47.699 --> 32:48.933
I have a toast.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.803
No. Miranda. No.

32:51.869 --> 32:52.937
No.

32:57.809 --> 33:02.380
- I stood
looking over the damage,

33:02.480 --> 33:06.951
trying to remember
the sweetness of life on Earth.

33:09.954 --> 33:12.223
I was late.

33:12.323 --> 33:14.993
Or you were early.

33:15.059 --> 33:18.696
Either one. Same mission.

33:18.796 --> 33:22.133
Burn every parasite
motherfucker alive.

33:22.200 --> 33:23.001
Oh!

33:32.677 --> 33:36.514
- Is--is that a quote?

33:39.350 --> 33:40.385
I wrote that.

33:40.485 --> 33:42.854
You did?

33:42.920 --> 33:44.722
- Yeah.

33:44.822 --> 33:48.092
I played two parts
in that movie. No?

33:48.192 --> 33:52.063
I played Orion's soldier me
and, like, an alien me.

33:52.163 --> 33:55.166
- Possessed by an alien you.
- Mm-hmm.

33:55.233 --> 33:56.934
- Yeah, we used to run lines
together.

33:57.035 --> 33:59.437
Remember, Clark?

33:59.537 --> 34:03.608
We did, Arthur.

34:03.708 --> 34:05.109
Sorry. Excuse me.

34:12.717 --> 34:15.686
- I think I died, like,
two times in that movie.

34:15.753 --> 34:17.455
- Really?
- Yes. Yes.

34:17.555 --> 34:19.123
Technically three.

34:55.226 --> 34:56.828
I miss cocaine.

35:08.439 --> 35:11.409
When did it start?

35:11.476 --> 35:13.411
With Elizabeth?

35:15.446 --> 35:16.914
I don't know.

35:18.683 --> 35:20.351
He must have gotten scared.

35:20.451 --> 35:21.853
That's usually what happens
when he falls in love.

35:21.953 --> 35:25.523
- Scared of what?

35:25.623 --> 35:28.192
Fuck knows.

35:28.292 --> 35:32.196
"Epsilon" didn't do
as well as "Delta."

35:32.296 --> 35:35.166
He lost that part
to Mel Gibson.

35:40.805 --> 35:42.640
It's just work.

35:42.707 --> 35:45.810
It's the thing you do.
It's not life.

35:51.983 --> 35:55.686
- I think that book
ruined my life.

36:27.185 --> 36:30.087
- I thought you hadn't seen
any of my movies.

36:32.323 --> 36:34.992
We don't have to talk.

36:39.197 --> 36:41.599
- You know, Elizabeth and I,
we've never--

36:41.699 --> 36:43.100
I don't care who you fuck.

36:49.006 --> 36:52.877
We both knew
this was temporary.

36:52.944 --> 36:54.745
I didn't.

36:56.914 --> 36:59.750
Pool house is on fire.

37:35.920 --> 37:40.625
<i>To be loved is a calamity</i>
<i>for someone with your job.</i>

37:40.725 --> 37:42.593
<i>You have work to do.</i>

37:42.660 --> 37:44.495
<i>Work.</i>

37:44.595 --> 37:48.065
<i>Love will try to see the words</i>
<i>before it's finished.</i>

37:50.001 --> 37:52.670
<i>Love makes work impossible.</i>

38:00.278 --> 38:02.246
<i>Survival is insufficient.</i>

38:05.449 --> 38:08.819
<i>I don't want to live</i>
<i>the wrong life and then die.</i>

38:12.156 --> 38:16.193
<i>I am at my best</i>
<i>when I'm escaping.</i>

38:26.871 --> 38:28.272
You started over.

38:30.975 --> 38:35.046
Tyler would love this.

38:35.146 --> 38:37.014
My son.

38:37.782 --> 38:40.184
With Elizabeth.

38:42.019 --> 38:44.055
Yeah.

38:47.525 --> 38:50.494
Send him that one.

38:50.561 --> 38:51.896
I have more.

38:55.733 --> 38:58.669
Really good to see you.

39:20.491 --> 39:23.060
W-where is the bar?

40:10.541 --> 40:13.944
- Hey, Carroll.
How was that Christmas party?

40:14.044 --> 40:15.713
There wasn't one.

40:15.780 --> 40:16.981
- Well, you can get ready
to call me Santa Claus, then,

40:17.081 --> 40:20.117
because our pitch is back on.

40:20.217 --> 40:22.086
The Chinese are in play.

40:22.153 --> 40:23.821
I heard Huang tried to get out
on a hydrofoil, but it broke.

40:23.921 --> 40:25.322
The, um--

40:25.423 --> 40:28.659
I don't know, the--
the foil part, I guess.

40:28.759 --> 40:31.495
Anyway, the Bodhisattva Room
is a packed house,

40:31.595 --> 40:33.898
and they are ready
to make a deal.

40:35.332 --> 40:37.168
Everything like it was.

40:37.268 --> 40:38.669
Everything exactly like it was.

40:38.769 --> 40:40.805
So...

40:40.905 --> 40:43.774
let's go land this.

40:46.477 --> 40:47.144
Okay.

40:47.244 --> 40:49.680
- Yeah,
we're up in six minutes.

40:49.780 --> 40:51.449
Could I get a Boilermaker,
please?

40:51.515 --> 40:53.017
Make it two.

40:53.117 --> 40:55.352
Air and sea unite.

41:21.645 --> 41:26.050
You all seem to know that
the world is coming to an end.

41:26.150 --> 41:28.619
So...

41:28.686 --> 41:30.521
it's a good reminder

41:30.621 --> 41:32.289
that nothing we have done

41:32.356 --> 41:35.292
or do matters at all.

41:41.365 --> 41:43.734
But it does.

41:43.834 --> 41:45.736
It does.

41:47.905 --> 41:50.841
The man I loved...

41:50.908 --> 41:53.878
died last night,

41:53.978 --> 41:55.079
and--

41:59.250 --> 42:00.184
The man I loved

42:00.251 --> 42:04.421
died last night,
and I went to work.

42:07.324 --> 42:12.696
The man I loved
died last night,

42:12.763 --> 42:14.598
and I went to work instead.

42:17.701 --> 42:22.840
And I'm here with you
and you and--

42:27.211 --> 42:28.279
You don't matter at all,
Mr. Huang.

42:28.379 --> 42:32.383
Your company is falling
into the sea.

42:32.449 --> 42:36.287
So I have to ask...

42:41.892 --> 42:44.361
Why wasn't I at that play?

42:46.196 --> 42:50.367
Why I wasn't I with my love
when he died?

43:06.250 --> 43:08.452
Jim.

43:21.332 --> 43:25.336
- When mankind first looked up
to the stars, mankind thought:

43:25.436 --> 43:28.439
nonlinear delivery options--

43:28.505 --> 43:31.408
what are those things?

43:33.978 --> 43:37.181
That was some intense stuff
in there, Carroll.

43:40.351 --> 43:43.087
We're all gonna die, huh?

43:43.153 --> 43:46.357
I think so, Jim.

43:46.457 --> 43:48.158
I'm sorry.

43:50.160 --> 43:52.096
I don't even know
if you have family back home.

43:52.162 --> 43:55.332
I do not.

43:55.432 --> 44:00.004
I do not. Do not.
Not. Not. I do not.

44:00.104 --> 44:01.505
I don't either.

44:01.605 --> 44:02.873
- You know,
it makes me want to unpack

44:02.973 --> 44:06.677
some of my self-esteem baggage
big-time before we--

44:11.482 --> 44:12.216
I went golfing
because I thought

44:12.316 --> 44:15.386
that's what a person would do.

44:15.486 --> 44:16.687
I know.

44:19.289 --> 44:21.191
I'm so scared.

44:43.213 --> 44:47.184
- I'm scared, too, Jim.

44:47.251 --> 44:49.153
- Really?

44:49.219 --> 44:50.854
Yeah.

45:00.531 --> 45:02.900
- I heard they're giving out
complimentary room-sealing kits

45:03.000 --> 45:04.935
- at the front desk.
- Yeah, we should go get some.

45:05.035 --> 45:07.037
Yeah.

45:09.573 --> 45:11.542
Probably going like hotcakes.

45:15.212 --> 45:16.847
- <i>Leon?</i>

45:16.914 --> 45:19.950
<i>Hey. It's me.</i>

45:20.050 --> 45:22.586
<i>Sorry it took so long</i>
<i>to call you back.</i>

45:24.688 --> 45:27.791
<i>- Did you get there?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

45:27.891 --> 45:30.527
<i>I'm on board</i>
<i>the "Robespierre."</i>

45:30.594 --> 45:34.465
<i>I knew you were a survivor.</i>

45:36.767 --> 45:39.069
<i>You got me here.</i>

45:43.574 --> 45:46.276
<i>Okay. Okay.</i>

45:46.376 --> 45:49.046
<i>Okay.</i>

45:49.113 --> 45:51.949
I'm safe.

46:09.566 --> 46:11.835
Really good to see you.

46:14.438 --> 46:17.174
Stay.

46:17.274 --> 46:18.242
Huh?

46:18.308 --> 46:20.677
Let's have dinner.

46:28.318 --> 46:29.686
- There's this
Italian restaurant

46:29.787 --> 46:30.854
that's across the street.

46:30.954 --> 46:34.091
I know the guy.
He's very--he's very funny.

46:34.158 --> 46:37.027
Arthur, I'd miss my flight.

46:37.127 --> 46:37.694
Okay.

46:47.137 --> 46:49.173
- But I--

46:49.273 --> 46:53.043
I can come back.

46:53.143 --> 46:54.444
Yes.

47:10.994 --> 47:13.564
Bye.

47:24.908 --> 47:28.078
<i>I have a job to do.</i>

47:28.178 --> 47:28.912
<i>I still have a job to do.</i>

47:29.012 --> 47:32.382
<i>I have found you</i>
<i>nine times before,</i>

47:32.482 --> 47:33.383
<i>maybe ten,</i>

47:33.483 --> 47:35.586
<i>and I'll find you again.</i>

47:40.924 --> 47:43.260
<i>There is no rescue mission.</i>

47:46.530 --> 47:48.765
<i>We are safe.</i>
