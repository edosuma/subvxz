WEBVTT

00:00.021 --> 00:03.432
Previously, on AMC's "Hell on Wheels."

00:03.532 --> 00:05.431
I would like you to have this...

00:05.531 --> 00:07.529
Piece of silver don't
buy back what you took.

00:07.629 --> 00:09.660
I hope you're not
looking for an apology.

00:09.760 --> 00:12.836
There is no way...
Durant gives up Ogden.

00:12.936 --> 00:14.730
Get Grant to give us Ogden,

00:14.830 --> 00:17.204
and it's millions of
dollars worth of coal.

00:17.304 --> 00:19.791
This contest... hadn't
ought to end in a room!

00:19.891 --> 00:21.729
Ogden should go to the man
who gets there first.

00:21.829 --> 00:25.015
Bohannan? Hardly the
adversary I expected.

00:25.149 --> 00:26.133
Mr. Bohannan, tell me:

00:26.233 --> 00:28.114
do you plan to stay with
the Central Pacific

00:28.214 --> 00:29.410
until the end of this race?

00:33.167 --> 00:36.571
Between the pounding of that
first spike in Council Bluffs,

00:36.647 --> 00:37.740
and the last,

00:37.848 --> 00:40.157
yet to be struck, here
in North-Eastern Utah...

00:41.904 --> 00:46.417
Thomas Durant, Collis Huntington
and their mighty railroads

00:46.517 --> 00:49.114
have bamboozled and brow-beat Congress

00:49.214 --> 00:52.338
into paying for their splendid
blue-ribbon franchise...

00:55.769 --> 00:58.153
Over-budget and behind schedule,

00:58.253 --> 01:02.153
progress at every turn on the
great Transcontinental Railroad

01:02.442 --> 01:05.188
has been bedeviled by labor unrest,

01:05.613 --> 01:08.869
calamity of nature, God, and man.

01:09.750 --> 01:12.832
Having followed the loose
and turbulent population

01:13.254 --> 01:17.038
that over the last four years has
built this monument to folly...

01:17.859 --> 01:20.301
I can report no happier visage

01:20.501 --> 01:23.238
than the two railroads
laying down of iron

01:23.338 --> 01:25.574
within striking distance of one another.

01:31.106 --> 01:36.790
The line of workers stretches like an army
between Promontory and Weber Canyon...

01:40.248 --> 01:42.110
The Central Pacific to the west...

01:42.310 --> 01:44.124
The Union Pacific to the east...

01:44.520 --> 01:49.430
Each company racing toward the
prize that lies between Ogden...

01:50.260 --> 01:53.808
Its rich mineral deposits
promised by President Grant

01:53.997 --> 01:56.272
to whomever lays track there first.

02:00.337 --> 02:03.078
I shall be glad after the
last spike is driven,

02:03.812 --> 02:05.753
to contemplate the bond of iron

02:05.853 --> 02:10.179
which is to hold our beloved
nation in one eternal union.

02:11.086 --> 02:12.455
For it is, at last,

02:12.703 --> 02:16.081
no longer a question of "If
the road will be built?",

02:16.258 --> 02:19.221
but of who will cross the
finish line first...

02:33.943 --> 02:35.771
Will it be Doc Durant,

02:35.961 --> 02:40.086
the financial rascal with a burning
desire for wealth and fame?

02:40.417 --> 02:44.884
Or Collis P. Huntington and
his Chinese workforce,

02:44.984 --> 02:49.905
led now by America's great
railroad man, Cullen Bohannon?

02:59.637 --> 03:03.289
The answer, dear reader, will
be decided in the coming days

03:03.389 --> 03:05.312
on the plains of Utah,

03:05.577 --> 03:08.029
"at or near Ogden"

03:08.129 --> 03:10.031
as prescribed by Congress,

03:10.131 --> 03:12.883
and blessed by the Almighty above.

04:55.005 --> 04:57.729
As you can see, Governor, our
depot is under construction,

04:57.829 --> 05:00.702
and we have already drawn up
plans to turn this flyspeck

05:00.802 --> 05:02.176
into a functioning railroad junction.

05:02.276 --> 05:05.127
It's just a matter of 14 miles which...
- Our track is 12 miles from

05:05.264 --> 05:08.696
Ogden, that is two days'
work and two miles closer

05:08.796 --> 05:10.096
than the Central Pacific's

05:10.196 --> 05:12.694
and that is having laid
300 miles more track

05:12.839 --> 05:14.945
since the railroads broke ground...

05:15.045 --> 05:16.510
Without contending with
 the California Sierras

05:16.610 --> 05:18.230
 or the Great Nevada desert, sir.
- The Union Pacific's ...

05:18.330 --> 05:20.722
 grade arrived here first...

05:20.822 --> 05:23.008
- Ogden belongs to me!
- Gentlemen!

05:23.769 --> 05:27.081
The President's decision
in Salt Lake was clear.

05:27.181 --> 05:28.883
Ogden belongs to no one

05:28.983 --> 05:31.409
until someone lays track through it.

05:32.444 --> 05:35.901
Grant made you Deputy
Secretary of the Interior

05:36.001 --> 05:37.972
to make judgment calls, not to...

05:38.072 --> 05:40.141
You'll get your judgment, Mr. Durant,

05:40.987 --> 05:42.300
but not today.

05:48.261 --> 05:50.359
This is the mark!

05:51.097 --> 05:53.528
The first one who lays rail to it...

05:53.966 --> 05:55.515
Ogden is yours.

06:03.343 --> 06:06.134
Seven-mile day ahead and you're
burning my daylight, Mr. Ming.

06:20.193 --> 06:22.501
White man offer, China man go.

06:22.601 --> 06:24.154
Half kutu, half work.

06:25.800 --> 06:28.405
Mmm-hmm.

06:51.227 --> 06:53.396
Figured somebody might
have killed you by now.

06:54.865 --> 06:56.248
Handsome animal.

06:56.348 --> 06:59.237
He ain't for sale, if that's
what you're thinking.

07:09.279 --> 07:11.322
Somebody nearly did
kill you, didn't they?

07:12.750 --> 07:14.171
I ain't surprised.

07:14.752 --> 07:17.531
What was it over,
 love or hate?

07:19.757 --> 07:21.493
I hear Mickey's working for Durant.

07:23.661 --> 07:25.197
He ain't out on the cut,

07:27.098 --> 07:28.177
try the saloon.

07:32.838 --> 07:34.004
Obliged.

07:39.077 --> 07:40.877
Durant tell you to poach my men?

07:41.179 --> 07:44.281
Jesus Christ Almighty.

07:45.851 --> 07:47.663
I heard you made it out the desert.

07:47.763 --> 07:49.972
My workers. Right now.

07:50.072 --> 07:52.360
I got no use for
rat-eaters, Mr. Bohannon.

07:52.525 --> 07:54.672
My workers got poached same as yours.

07:54.772 --> 07:56.346
- Dutch.
- He speaks true.

07:56.545 --> 07:58.848
Rail crew's down 200
men just this morning.

07:59.699 --> 08:02.822
Lured away by a man who works
for the Six Mile Canyon Mine.

08:03.185 --> 08:04.502
They call him "The Pirate".

08:05.877 --> 08:08.306
"The Pirate." In Utah.

08:09.014 --> 08:10.547
No match for us, sure.

08:15.587 --> 08:17.220
This mine within riding distance?

08:27.233 --> 08:28.799
Get out the way, Chinaman!

08:32.405 --> 08:34.205
Oi, out of my way boy.

08:44.685 --> 08:46.602
Missed you on the cut
this morning, Mr. Lee.

08:46.702 --> 08:48.437
Railroad almost done,

08:48.737 --> 08:49.988
men need job.

08:50.558 --> 08:52.557
Pirate offer long job.

08:52.927 --> 08:55.995
We're looking for the one who
calls himself "The Pirate"!

09:00.067 --> 09:01.234
You found him!

09:05.240 --> 09:07.006
God damn, Jim.

09:07.409 --> 09:10.495
Good to see you too, Bohannon.
You looking for work?

09:10.595 --> 09:12.563
Looking for the man who
poached my workers.

09:12.821 --> 09:14.434
Hired, you mean.

09:14.837 --> 09:16.470
You know this gobshite?

09:17.806 --> 09:19.473
He used to be my friend.

09:26.078 --> 09:29.719
A railroad that cannot safely
convey goods and souls

09:29.819 --> 09:31.626
is no railroad at all, Governor.

09:31.726 --> 09:34.237
And when you build a track
with lies and bribes

09:34.337 --> 09:36.903
and every shortcut a devious
mind can machinate,

09:37.003 --> 09:40.888
what you leave behind is a
dangerous and a bumpy ride.

09:41.357 --> 09:44.431
Were we riding on Union Pacific track,

09:44.531 --> 09:47.165
our laps would be drenched
right now, for a fact.

09:47.629 --> 09:49.509
God himself would break his back

09:49.609 --> 09:52.403
trying to build 14 miles in two days.

09:52.503 --> 09:55.402
And while Bohannon is a
formidable railroad man,

09:55.502 --> 09:57.490
I... I need assurances

09:57.590 --> 10:00.508
that you'll see to it that the
Central Pacific wins Ogden

10:01.745 --> 10:03.909
and the two and a half million dollar

10:04.009 --> 10:06.037
left in government railroad bonds.

10:06.282 --> 10:09.995
Mr. Huntington, if you want Ogden,

10:10.453 --> 10:13.412
you will make it your
business to be there first.

10:14.424 --> 10:17.547
I might think your time better
spent swinging a hammer

10:18.095 --> 10:20.937
than trying to hoodwink
me with a glass of water.

10:22.800 --> 10:24.933
Look, you give me Ogden,

10:26.604 --> 10:31.919
and I will reroute the five
southern railroad lines I own

10:32.410 --> 10:34.486
from Promontory to Cheyenne.

10:34.586 --> 10:39.252
Your majestic city will sit as the most
important railroad junction in the country.

10:39.418 --> 10:41.807
Can Thomas Durant give you that?

10:45.223 --> 10:46.619
I see...

10:47.192 --> 10:49.286
I thought you would!

10:49.821 --> 10:52.446
You're every bit the snake he is.

10:53.733 --> 10:57.203
This is a new day, Mr. Huntington.

10:58.571 --> 11:04.131
Unlike his predecessor, President Grant
has vowed to keep his administration

11:04.231 --> 11:05.796
free from corruption.

11:06.646 --> 11:08.562
He cannot be bought, sir.

11:09.482 --> 11:11.297
And neither can I.

11:13.622 --> 11:15.278
Thanks for the water.

11:21.428 --> 11:23.059
I'm surprised to find you here, Jim.

11:27.250 --> 11:29.274
Everybody got to be somewhere, Bohannon.

11:29.374 --> 11:30.770
No, I mean down in the hole.

11:31.172 --> 11:32.726
Thought you was afraid of the dark.

11:32.956 --> 11:35.150
The only reason I stayed
away from the tunnel

11:35.258 --> 11:37.961
was Hannah didn't want me
tracking dirt into the house.

11:38.061 --> 11:39.863
She's in Vermont with the kids.

11:39.963 --> 11:42.883
You here, family back East,

11:44.185 --> 11:46.007
that don't seem like you, Jim.

11:46.321 --> 11:48.989
Mining has helped me figure
things out, Bohannon.

11:49.391 --> 11:51.971
Life is simple down here.

11:52.294 --> 11:54.146
Cut a vein, bleed it dry,

11:54.246 --> 11:56.882
scrape away until there's nothing left.

11:56.982 --> 11:59.146
That's a real shame about
Hannah and the kids.

11:59.617 --> 12:01.349
Don't cry for me.

12:04.306 --> 12:05.774
I need my workers, Jim.

12:05.874 --> 12:07.225
What you need is work.

12:07.325 --> 12:08.986
The railroad's done.

12:09.086 --> 12:11.145
Those men know it,
that's why they're here!

12:11.245 --> 12:13.526
All I'm asking for is
two days. That's it.

12:17.521 --> 12:19.509
As far as the railroad figures go,

12:21.258 --> 12:25.941
I'm skint, Mr. Bohannon.

12:33.771 --> 12:35.068
Mr. Strobridge.

12:38.376 --> 12:41.040
I know you need long term work.

12:41.140 --> 12:42.884
And I have plans for it.

12:42.984 --> 12:45.644
What do you say to San Francisco, boys?

12:46.051 --> 12:48.237
There's demand for skilled workers

12:48.554 --> 12:50.455
and I have it already arranged.

12:50.555 --> 12:52.443
I'm saying we've jobs here.

12:52.658 --> 12:54.825
You had a job on the railroad, Paddy.

12:54.925 --> 12:56.782
You had a warm bed when you were cold,

12:57.131 --> 12:59.152
a full whiskey when you were thirsty

12:59.252 --> 13:01.744
and even fuller woman
when you were lonely.

13:03.012 --> 13:05.828
I provided the same to every loyal man

13:06.406 --> 13:08.057
with an understanding...

13:08.157 --> 13:09.757
We ain't scared of you, Mick.

13:09.857 --> 13:11.842
Not now Johnny Shea's gone.

13:15.481 --> 13:16.881
I'm trying to help you.

13:24.491 --> 13:27.130
Anyone else prefer
mining to railroad work?

13:28.329 --> 13:29.595
Mr. Lee,

13:33.234 --> 13:34.696
I need these workers.

13:36.171 --> 13:37.420
Just until we get to Ogden.

13:37.520 --> 13:39.724
Whatever the mine's paying
you, I'll match it.

13:39.824 --> 13:41.491
Plus a bonus if you get
us there before the U.P.

13:41.591 --> 13:42.664
Bring these two.

13:42.794 --> 13:44.410
I'll see to it they get home.

13:46.881 --> 13:49.714
Anyone who wants to leave
here is free to go.

13:49.814 --> 13:52.110
You are not indentured to
me like you were to Chang.

13:55.240 --> 13:58.727
But know this, if anyone
leaves here, even for an hour,

13:58.827 --> 14:01.964
you ain't got a job when you
get back. Is that clear?

14:04.367 --> 14:06.850
Mr. Lee, you been with the Central
Pacific since Sacramento,

14:07.966 --> 14:10.617
you got us through the desert. You're
gonna want to see it finished.

14:27.424 --> 14:29.691
Chinaman need long work, Bossman.

14:30.327 --> 14:31.645
Railroad done.

14:31.745 --> 14:34.374
Mine is good. We stay.

14:41.839 --> 14:43.072
All right.

14:44.709 --> 14:46.627
Load these bodies up on the wagon.

14:46.844 --> 14:48.061
But we stay.

14:48.880 --> 14:51.244
My offer stands either way, Mr. Lee.

14:51.554 --> 14:52.752
We'll get him home.

14:53.419 --> 14:55.126
Thank you, Bossman.

14:59.658 --> 15:01.844
When you get to Ogden,
look me up, Bohannon,

15:02.609 --> 15:04.188
I'll buy you a drink.

15:20.980 --> 15:22.926
Come on. Like that.

15:23.026 --> 15:24.032
Offer a hand?

15:25.587 --> 15:27.234
Ain't you got a race to win?

15:27.699 --> 15:28.751
Come on.

15:29.623 --> 15:31.578
Can't win with no workers.

15:32.241 --> 15:33.724
Oh, oh.

15:34.042 --> 15:36.046
And can't train a horse that
don't want to be trained, but ...

15:36.991 --> 15:38.543
 I keep trying anyways.

15:38.915 --> 15:40.821
They call him Bucephalus.

15:40.949 --> 15:44.731
But I call him... Mc...

15:45.340 --> 15:47.140
It means Free Spirit.

15:47.672 --> 15:48.956
How'd you come by him?

15:50.294 --> 15:51.778
He was lost.

15:52.947 --> 15:54.514
Then he found me.

16:00.121 --> 16:02.421
It was love that nearly
killed you, wasn't it?

16:03.526 --> 16:05.406
Wasn't lost.

16:06.061 --> 16:07.465
She ran.

16:08.164 --> 16:09.847
I done it, too.

16:09.947 --> 16:13.319
I ran from my Mojave family.

16:13.419 --> 16:14.980
Soldiers came to the camp,

16:15.080 --> 16:17.383
found out the Indians had a
white girl living with them.

16:17.754 --> 16:21.698
Swore they'd attack the village
unless they handed me over.

16:21.798 --> 16:24.757
Me staying meant their death.

16:28.779 --> 16:32.230
Sometimes the loving thing to do is run.

16:36.186 --> 16:38.035
This'll get you two, not three.

16:38.135 --> 16:39.537
Two bottles of the good stuff then.

16:39.637 --> 16:41.071
Save your money, Mr. Jackson.

16:42.410 --> 16:43.459
Here.

16:44.763 --> 16:46.977
Knew I smelled me a traitor.

16:51.870 --> 16:53.418
Here you are.

16:56.287 --> 16:58.978
- I can buy my own whiskey, Mr. Bohannon.
- No.

16:59.412 --> 17:01.478
When I come through Cheyenne,

17:01.797 --> 17:04.515
with a wife and baby
and no way to provide

17:05.251 --> 17:07.334
weren't necessary for
you to hire me neither.

17:07.434 --> 17:09.279
Gave you a job slinging rock.

17:09.821 --> 17:10.921
I was glad to have it.

17:15.942 --> 17:20.444
- Buncha big wigs be here for the finish.
- Mmm-hmm.

17:20.545 --> 17:24.113
Reckon history won't remember the hand ol'
Psalms play in building this railroad.

17:24.371 --> 17:25.537
One day

17:27.741 --> 17:30.141
some young man'll ride them rails

17:31.211 --> 17:33.528
to see his fiance and he'll
get himself married.

17:33.628 --> 17:37.015
Rancher in Omaha sell
his cattle to New York,

17:37.385 --> 17:40.486
fisherman, his catch from
San Francisco to Chicago.

17:41.722 --> 17:43.855
Some daughter will need to
go home, bury her daddy,

17:44.073 --> 17:45.838
them rails right there'll take her.

17:47.295 --> 17:48.627
You done that.

17:51.866 --> 17:54.101
- We done that.
- But...

17:58.574 --> 18:00.807
To the best goddamn railroad man I know.

18:20.997 --> 18:22.530
Couldn't sleep.

18:23.032 --> 18:24.714
Take less water with your whiskey.

18:24.814 --> 18:27.342
That's barkeep's advice.
You're a shareholder now.

18:27.470 --> 18:29.311
Not bad for an Irish bumpkin.

18:32.643 --> 18:35.377
It's a long way from a magic
lantern show, I know that.

18:52.731 --> 18:54.939
Never thought I'd end up a railroad man.

18:55.181 --> 18:56.797
Careful it don't kill you.

18:57.084 --> 18:59.235
Railroad job got me out of the saloon,

19:00.005 --> 19:02.038
same as it'll get me to San Francisco.

19:02.307 --> 19:05.241
Sze Yup company controls labor
there, I'd steer clear.

19:05.577 --> 19:07.745
I ain't afraid to tangle
with the Chinese.

19:08.447 --> 19:11.448
Whole lot of Irish'll be looking
for work come sundown tomorrow,

19:13.085 --> 19:15.186
I'll secure their futures
as well as me own.

19:18.457 --> 19:19.456
If you're in need...

19:21.928 --> 19:22.927
Right.

19:24.430 --> 19:26.964
I ain't thought past the first
rail laid tomorrow morning.

19:27.401 --> 19:28.733
After that?

19:30.183 --> 19:31.382
Second rail.

19:32.039 --> 19:34.171
Last rail gets laid
tomorrow. Win or lose.

19:36.777 --> 19:38.443
I prefer to win.

19:38.572 --> 19:41.373
Central Pacific would be
the betting man's choice.

19:44.452 --> 19:45.651
Mick.

19:47.789 --> 19:50.022
We laid four mile of track today.

19:51.426 --> 19:53.926
That leaves us 10 tomorrow to your six.

19:55.897 --> 19:58.864
And no man ever laid 10 mile
of track in one day before.

20:00.802 --> 20:02.336
After all this time,

20:03.305 --> 20:06.857
I've learned never to bet
against Cullen Bohannon.

20:09.511 --> 20:10.610
Well...

20:11.714 --> 20:13.580
I don't believe in miracles, Mick.

20:15.150 --> 20:16.316
Me neither.

20:20.257 --> 20:21.435
See you tomorrow.

20:22.158 --> 20:23.424
Yeah.

20:28.955 --> 20:30.231
Hey, Mick.

20:42.539 --> 20:43.712
Good luck.

20:44.081 --> 20:45.281
Thank you.

22:29.459 --> 22:32.193
Bossman. Finish what we start.

22:36.867 --> 22:38.900
10 miles in a day.

22:39.636 --> 22:41.154
Ain't never been done.

22:41.254 --> 22:43.505
That is what they say
about the Great Wall.

22:47.078 --> 22:48.577
Tell the men to listen up.

23:10.169 --> 23:11.985
We have moved mountains.

23:15.474 --> 23:17.191
It's been an honor, gentleman.

23:23.541 --> 23:24.742
M'ghoi?

23:43.947 --> 23:45.281
Grab the rail!

23:46.929 --> 23:49.458
Set the pace. Don't slow down.

23:55.455 --> 23:57.772
And drumroll.

24:15.843 --> 24:18.460
All right, move on.
Next rail! Next rail!

24:18.560 --> 24:20.890
Pick it up, boys. Pick it up.

24:21.899 --> 24:24.851
Them's the rail, boys! Them's the rail!

24:27.188 --> 24:28.705
And next rail!

24:30.708 --> 24:32.959
Moving out of line!

24:39.702 --> 24:40.701
Ho!

24:47.476 --> 24:48.475
Ho!

24:55.519 --> 24:56.518
Okay!

25:10.033 --> 25:12.017
The bastards are gaining
on us, McGinnes.

25:12.117 --> 25:14.587
If it's faster you want,
pick up a bleedin' hammer.

25:14.687 --> 25:16.388
- Mr. Psalms.
- Uh-huh.

25:16.488 --> 25:18.369
Half-spike the rail from here on out.

25:18.469 --> 25:19.459
That ain't safe, Mr. Durant.

25:19.559 --> 25:21.076
Thank you, Mr. Psalms.

25:26.595 --> 25:29.503
Paddy, Dutch, half-spike
the rails here on out.

25:29.603 --> 25:31.337
It's double time, let's go.

25:31.437 --> 25:32.741
Pick it up, lads!

25:32.841 --> 25:34.976
If we wrong now, that's our asses.

25:35.076 --> 25:38.378
Lord look out for the
righteous, Paul. Hurry up now.

25:38.478 --> 25:41.231
Hurry up, now. Let's get it, boys.

25:41.867 --> 25:44.151
Central Pacific, seven miles, stop.

25:44.251 --> 25:45.987
Three to go, stop.

25:46.087 --> 25:48.806
Union Pacific,
four-and-a-half miles, stop.

25:49.174 --> 25:51.609
One and a half to go, stop.

25:57.383 --> 25:59.750
Exhaustion setting in, stop.

26:00.687 --> 26:03.816
Workers on both sides dropping, stop.

26:07.026 --> 26:10.562
Race will be won by
feet, not miles, stop.

26:11.899 --> 26:15.452
By heart, not man power, stop.

26:21.509 --> 26:23.275
Men. Listen to me.

26:30.585 --> 26:34.405
There ahead lies the finish line,

26:34.505 --> 26:36.574
less than one mile away.

26:36.674 --> 26:39.277
I have worked tirelessly and endlessly

26:39.377 --> 26:43.118
to get you here in the name
of this great endeavor.

26:43.365 --> 26:47.035
Now, you must return the favor.

26:48.571 --> 26:51.556
Work! Work like there's no tomorrow.

26:51.656 --> 26:54.595
Get me to that finish line!

27:04.354 --> 27:05.954
Psalms, where are you going?

27:39.223 --> 27:40.440
Mr. Bohannon...

27:40.541 --> 27:41.592
What?

28:19.066 --> 28:21.300
Half on spikes, half on rails.

28:24.805 --> 28:26.071
You heard Matt.

28:27.608 --> 28:29.102
Come on, let's get it, boys.

28:30.360 --> 28:31.677
May clear!

29:23.200 --> 29:25.033
Double-time, McGinnes.

29:25.369 --> 29:26.968
Double-time!

30:18.024 --> 30:20.291
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey!

31:41.112 --> 31:42.178
Hold!

32:34.303 --> 32:36.520
Hey, man, why aren't
you celebrating, huh?

32:36.620 --> 32:37.932
No work tomorrow.

32:38.032 --> 32:40.191
Oh, man, tomorrow you
worry about tomorrow.

32:40.291 --> 32:42.585
Tonight we celebrating!

32:42.685 --> 32:44.628
Come on, with me.

32:52.054 --> 32:53.998
Hey, it's done.

32:54.591 --> 32:56.424
The whole thing is bloody finished.

33:14.212 --> 33:16.629
It's quite a thing we
bear witness to tonight.

33:16.729 --> 33:18.798
On that much, we agree.

33:18.898 --> 33:19.882
Mmm.

33:20.718 --> 33:22.736
Well, we agree on more than that.

33:22.836 --> 33:25.171
We agree that a deal is indeed a deal.

33:28.192 --> 33:31.612
2.4 million dollars in the
coal fields of Ogden.

33:31.712 --> 33:33.077
Let's get this done.

33:39.907 --> 33:43.957
President Grant's recent amendment
to the United States Railroad Act.

33:44.057 --> 33:45.827
A glass of champagne, Thomas.

33:45.927 --> 33:47.795
Let's celebrate what we've
accomplished tonight.

33:47.895 --> 33:51.967
Stating expressly that
bonds are not to be issued

33:52.067 --> 33:56.053
until government inspectors
have deemed the road worthy.

33:56.222 --> 33:59.641
All travel on the line
is to cease immediately

33:59.741 --> 34:02.745
until said inspection has taken place,

34:02.845 --> 34:05.347
and it is determined which railroad

34:05.447 --> 34:07.699
has a rightful claim to Ogden.

34:16.076 --> 34:17.460
All right.

34:17.561 --> 34:18.777
All right?

34:19.380 --> 34:20.913
Read for yourself.

34:21.514 --> 34:24.034
Another stunt, Governor Campbell,

34:24.135 --> 34:26.753
for which Mr. Durant
is very well famous.

34:26.987 --> 34:28.788
Stunt or not,

34:29.224 --> 34:32.492
in the event of a dispute, an
inspector needs to verify.

34:32.761 --> 34:38.130
You seemed plenty confident in your track's
integrity yesterday, Mr. Huntington.

34:38.800 --> 34:41.451
I can't imagine there'll be
a problem with it today,

34:41.551 --> 34:43.103
or with your records.

34:46.409 --> 34:47.493
Goddamn it!

34:47.592 --> 34:50.696
Thomas, the fact is, and cannot change,

34:50.795 --> 34:52.284
it will read about in the history books,

34:52.656 --> 34:54.004
I beat you, sir.

34:54.103 --> 34:55.402
I beat you to Ogden.

34:55.985 --> 34:57.899
I win. You lose.

34:58.421 --> 34:59.737
It's over, sir.

34:59.837 --> 35:04.259
Only if your rail stands
up to inspection, Collis.

35:09.001 --> 35:10.334
Only then.

35:15.307 --> 35:17.374
Congratulations, Mr. Bohannon.

35:17.910 --> 35:19.109
Mmm.

35:22.115 --> 35:23.199
You did it.

35:23.299 --> 35:25.300
Hey! Hey! We did it!

35:25.400 --> 35:26.584
They did it.

35:29.790 --> 35:32.141
How are you feeling right about now?

35:32.241 --> 35:33.958
For the record, of course.

35:35.796 --> 35:37.195
Like it's over.

35:39.967 --> 35:44.770
Does that make you happy or sad?

35:52.513 --> 35:54.220
The cost was high.

35:55.550 --> 35:56.683
Well...

35:57.419 --> 36:00.453
You did the impossible,
the unimaginable.

36:01.824 --> 36:03.823
Is any cost really too high?

36:05.894 --> 36:08.962
Them's is questions for
presidents and poets to answer.

36:09.231 --> 36:10.297
Mmm.

36:11.467 --> 36:13.724
History will not forget
you, Mr. Bohannon.

36:13.824 --> 36:15.252
Or what you did.

36:17.774 --> 36:19.140
Yeah...

36:20.710 --> 36:22.009
You say so.

36:24.514 --> 36:25.728
So what's next?

36:25.828 --> 36:28.634
For America's greatest railroad man?

36:31.121 --> 36:32.954
The Chinamen got a saying,

36:41.465 --> 36:42.965
Make friends with change,

36:44.768 --> 36:46.602
it's the only thing you can count on.

37:00.185 --> 37:02.185
Your absurd little plan won't work.

37:02.454 --> 37:03.771
You think I'm scared?

37:03.871 --> 37:06.923
You think I'll hand you Ogden to
avoid a government inspection.

37:09.262 --> 37:10.694
Thomas, I won.

37:11.797 --> 37:16.700
When those government inspectors
order you to rip up and rebuild

37:16.836 --> 37:20.855
half the shoddy track you laid
either side of the 50 miles

37:20.955 --> 37:22.691
you buttered up for Campbell,

37:22.791 --> 37:26.312
it'll cost you a hell of
a lot more than Ogden.

37:27.413 --> 37:30.065
And when those very same
inspectors look at your track,

37:30.165 --> 37:33.235
half-spiked, half tied, held
together with a prayer,

37:33.335 --> 37:35.972
they're gonna ask some
very tough questions,

37:36.072 --> 37:38.623
including what the hell have
you done with all their money?

37:40.661 --> 37:42.894
You'll land in jail over this.

37:43.075 --> 37:46.311
I've been there before, Collis.
I'm willing to go back.

37:46.840 --> 37:47.939
Are you?

37:52.640 --> 37:53.873
You're mad.

37:56.311 --> 37:57.777
Good night, Collis.

37:58.179 --> 37:59.662
I'll give you half a million dollars.

37:59.762 --> 38:01.265
I don't want the money.

38:01.365 --> 38:02.932
Three-quarters of a million dollar.

38:03.032 --> 38:04.468
Enjoy the festivities.

38:04.568 --> 38:06.653
Oh, for Christ's sake, take it!

38:08.257 --> 38:09.589
Take Ogden.

38:10.292 --> 38:13.891
If that will end this,
Thomas, by all means,

38:15.965 --> 38:17.230
take it.

38:17.700 --> 38:20.651
But the ceremony happens at Promontory,

38:20.751 --> 38:22.154
on C.P. soil.

38:22.254 --> 38:24.056
And I keep all the government bonds.

38:24.156 --> 38:26.040
All two and a half
million dollars' worth.

38:30.080 --> 38:32.280
It's a pleasure doing
business with you, Collis.

38:36.086 --> 38:37.485
Go to hell!

38:54.171 --> 38:55.371
Boy.

39:54.402 --> 39:55.701
I won.

39:58.606 --> 39:59.839
Mmm.

40:00.709 --> 40:01.908
Wine?

40:04.012 --> 40:07.280
You may have gotten here first,

40:08.249 --> 40:09.715
but I own it.

40:09.951 --> 40:11.284
All of it.

40:12.620 --> 40:14.721
I made a deal with Huntington.

40:17.059 --> 40:18.358
Mmm.

40:21.464 --> 40:22.896
I beat you.

40:26.669 --> 40:27.935
All right.

40:28.838 --> 40:30.137
All right, Doc.

40:32.709 --> 40:34.008
You win.

40:35.578 --> 40:36.844
You win.

40:37.848 --> 40:39.614
I beat you, Bohannon!

40:40.250 --> 40:41.649
You lost!
