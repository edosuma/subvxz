04:04.280 --> 04:06.191
The Road To Reality.

04:07.640 --> 04:09.949
Don't wanna be going there.

04:13.720 --> 04:15.870
Hiya.

04:15.920 --> 04:18.992
An oasis of calm in here, mad out there.

04:23.720 --> 04:25.950
Gorgeous day for it, though, innit?

04:28.840 --> 04:30.751
Never been in here before.

04:57.680 --> 04:59.591
I like your hat.

05:23.280 --> 05:24.713
Busy?

05:27.400 --> 05:29.311
Hello?

05:32.800 --> 05:34.119
Having a bad day?

05:35.520 --> 05:36.430
No.

05:36.480 --> 05:38.675
Oh. Not till I showed up, eh?

05:40.720 --> 05:42.836
Look like a rabbit caught in the headlights.

05:42.880 --> 05:44.233
<i>I won't bite.</i>

05:45.040 --> 05:46.951
Don't worry, I'm going now.

05:47.600 --> 05:50.398
Have a good day. Stay happy.

05:52.440 --> 05:54.590
I ain't nicked nothing. Honest, guv'nor.

05:55.240 --> 05:57.549
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

06:08.480 --> 06:10.596
Oh, no, no, come on.

06:16.800 --> 06:18.711
That's just brilliant, that is.

06:22.520 --> 06:25.114
Oh, no, I didn't even get a chance
to say goodbye.

06:31.480 --> 06:36.873
<i># You'll never get it right
cos when you're laid in bed at night</i>

06:36.920 --> 06:40.071
<i># Watching...roaches climb the wall</i>

06:40.120 --> 06:43.157
<i># If you called your dad he could stop it all</i>

06:43.920 --> 06:46.593
<i># You'll never live like common people</i>

06:46.640 --> 06:49.757
<i># You'll never do what common people do</i>

06:49.800 --> 06:52.439
<i># You'll never fail like common people</i>

06:52.480 --> 06:55.711
<i># You'll never watch your life slide out of view</i>

06:56.480 --> 06:59.153
<i># And dance and drink and screw</i>

06:59.200 --> 07:01.111
<i># Because there's nothing else to do</i>

07:26.040 --> 07:27.917
The music's stopped.

07:27.960 --> 07:29.359
It stopped ages ago.

07:31.880 --> 07:33.871
Yeah, I was just enjoying the silence.

07:36.040 --> 07:37.359
<i>What?</i>

07:38.320 --> 07:40.072
What's so funny?

07:40.120 --> 07:42.873
I don't know!

07:44.280 --> 07:45.872
Can you just...

07:46.880 --> 07:48.632
Oh, your sister's woken up, Poppy.

07:50.120 --> 07:51.792
<i>Suzy, what's that?</i>

07:51.840 --> 07:53.956
<i>What is it? Is that your latest conquest?</i>

07:54.000 --> 07:56.639
Oh, bless him!

07:58.080 --> 08:00.435
Don't you ever pray that you're adopted, Suzy?

08:00.480 --> 08:01.708
Oh, argh!

08:01.760 --> 08:03.671
Yeah.

08:04.800 --> 08:06.756
You got me, Zoe.

08:07.960 --> 08:09.951
- Ssssh!
- Who are you shushing?

08:10.000 --> 08:12.070
No, no, no, no, no, no.

08:12.120 --> 08:16.875
She's right. Let's all enjoy the silence together.

08:16.920 --> 08:21.311
Dawn, will you shut up?
Because no-one else can get a word in.

08:21.360 --> 08:24.113
<i>Ssssssh!</i>

08:24.160 --> 08:25.593
Sorry!

08:26.600 --> 08:29.353
- Sssssh.
- Fingers on lips.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.038
Fingers on the tits.

08:31.080 --> 08:33.116
- Fingers on tits.
- Fingers on the hips.

08:33.159 --> 08:35.037
Can I borrow yours?

08:37.280 --> 08:40.158
- Fingers on the tits.
- Oh, that is properly disgusting.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.111
Chicken fillets. Lunch, anyone?

08:42.159 --> 08:43.957
<i>- Oh, hello!
- Can I have a go?</i>

08:44.000 --> 08:46.309
Of course you can, Dawn, you don't need to ask.

08:46.360 --> 08:49.079
- Anyone over there?
- Oh, I know where that's been.

08:50.720 --> 08:52.836
You have gone down in my estimation.

08:52.880 --> 08:54.677
I'm sorry, Alice.

08:54.720 --> 08:58.030
- I don't get why you wear them, Poppy.
- Oh, don't you?

08:58.080 --> 09:01.311
I mean, you just put them in your bra...

09:01.360 --> 09:02.236
Yeah?

09:02.280 --> 09:05.078
I like the way they make me feel, Suzy.

09:05.120 --> 09:07.554
<i>- Like a natural woman.
- That's right.</i>

09:07.600 --> 09:09.989
- I think it's in the wrong place.
- Ah, whoop!

09:10.040 --> 09:11.712
Oh, look, you've got three tits!

09:11.760 --> 09:13.671
She's like you, Zoe.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.517
<i>- No, that's three nipples.
- Oh, right.</i>

09:15.560 --> 09:17.039
Have you got three nipples?

09:18.480 --> 09:23.270
She doesn't like to talk about it.
I'm going to give her a little hug.

09:23.320 --> 09:25.834
- Over you go.
- Oh, that's quite nice. Do that again.

09:25.880 --> 09:27.791
Oh, really? Oh!

09:28.400 --> 09:29.719
Ooh!

09:34.200 --> 09:36.316
Your cleavage looks great from up here.

09:36.360 --> 09:38.271
- Thank you.
- I've got a bird's eye view.

09:39.480 --> 09:41.311
Come on, ladies, cop a load of this.

09:41.360 --> 09:43.112
Oh, yeah, roll up, roll up.

09:43.160 --> 09:44.593
Look at that!

09:44.640 --> 09:47.108
- It's good, isn't it?
- They're amazing.

09:47.160 --> 09:48.991
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.594
I think we know where Poppy's sleeping tonight.

10:02.040 --> 10:03.439
Morning.

10:03.480 --> 10:05.391
Time to get up, sleepyhead.

10:07.760 --> 10:09.671
Cup of tea here.

10:10.800 --> 10:13.075
Come on. You can do it.

10:14.040 --> 10:17.316
That's it. That's it, nearly there.

10:18.320 --> 10:20.550
Oh, here we go.

10:20.600 --> 10:23.478
- And she's up! Hey.
- Thanks.

10:25.680 --> 10:26.999
You all right?

10:27.040 --> 10:29.235
Yeah, I slept good.

10:29.280 --> 10:31.350
I heard you.

10:31.400 --> 10:34.153
You always start that.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.156
- I don't snore.
- I know. You never have.

10:36.920 --> 10:38.831
- I don't.
- I don't.

10:46.080 --> 10:48.958
- Are they still asleep?
- No, they buggered off ages ago.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.115
- Did they?
- Yeah.

10:50.160 --> 10:52.276
Oh, right.

10:52.320 --> 10:54.959
- What's the time?
- About 10 past 12.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.594
- They've got a bit of work to do.
- Have they?

10:58.640 --> 11:02.155
- Dawn's late with her dissertation.
- Oh, no. When are your exams?

11:02.200 --> 11:04.156
- Three weeks tomorrow.
- You'll be all right.

11:04.200 --> 11:07.476
Yeah. I'm totally chilled out about it.

11:07.520 --> 11:08.873
Of course you are.

11:08.920 --> 11:10.831
- I'm cool.
- Yeah.

11:11.640 --> 11:13.676
I'm just really stressed.

11:13.720 --> 11:15.870
What? Like an Eskimo with a headache?

11:18.280 --> 11:20.271
<i>- Does anyone want any toast?
- Yeah.</i>

11:20.320 --> 11:22.470
- Yes, please.
- With marmalade, two slices.

11:22.520 --> 11:23.953
Yeah, I know, cut on the diagonal.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.672
- Yeah.
- No crusts.

11:25.720 --> 11:28.712
<i>- Got it. Oh, do you know what?
- What?</i>

11:30.800 --> 11:32.756
- Oh, yeah.
- She's gone.

11:32.800 --> 11:35.234
The thing is, we're starting with criminal justice.

11:35.280 --> 11:37.589
- Is that your first exam?
- Yeah, it's crap.

11:37.640 --> 11:42.111
If we had cyber crime first,
or, like, crime and pleasure,

11:42.160 --> 11:44.435
I could ease myself into it.

11:44.480 --> 11:46.710
- No probs.
- Oh, you'll be all right, Suzy.

11:46.760 --> 11:49.479
Yeah, if we can get a degree, any idiot can.

11:49.520 --> 11:52.398
- You calling your sister an idiot?
- Calling you an idiot.

11:52.440 --> 11:53.714
Thank you.

11:53.760 --> 11:55.876
"Crime and pleasure", now that sounds good.

11:55.920 --> 11:57.876
- Sounds like last night.
- Yeah.

11:58.560 --> 12:00.755
You'll be all right.

12:00.800 --> 12:02.870
Yeah.

12:05.280 --> 12:06.679
- See you later.
- Alligator.

12:06.720 --> 12:09.280
- When are we going to see Helen?
- Yeah, when's the baby due?

12:09.320 --> 12:11.151
Don't know, soon. She's been texting me.

12:11.200 --> 12:13.395
- Me too, she's getting worse.
- I know, bless her.

12:13.440 --> 12:15.954
- Want to wait till after your exams?
- I want to get it over with.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.673
All right. Don't worry, leave her to me.

12:18.720 --> 12:22.998
- Text me, yeah?
- Work hard.

12:23.040 --> 12:25.474
Suze... you know it's that way, don't you?

12:25.520 --> 12:27.431
Oh, yeah.

12:44.840 --> 12:46.990
- These make good legs?
- Great.

12:47.040 --> 12:48.951
# I'm so excited...

13:17.880 --> 13:20.474
- It would be amazing to fly, wouldn't it?
- You reckon?

13:20.520 --> 13:22.431
Just... whoosh!

13:23.320 --> 13:26.039
- What? Like Mr Vertigo?
- Oh, yeah. I love that book.

13:26.080 --> 13:27.433
- Yeah.
- Oh, vultures.

13:27.480 --> 13:30.074
- Met a few of them.
- These could be useful.

13:30.120 --> 13:32.839
Oh, yeah, they're great.
Oh, look at him, he's gorgeous.

13:32.880 --> 13:34.677
We could do an owl, they've got big heads.

13:34.720 --> 13:37.109
Good idea. He's got your eyes, look.

13:37.160 --> 13:39.276
- Cheers, Poppy.
- No, they're lovely.

13:39.320 --> 13:40.639
Do penguins emigrate?

13:40.680 --> 13:42.716
What? Do they move to the Costa del Sol?

13:42.760 --> 13:44.432
Emigrate, migrate, whatever.

13:44.480 --> 13:47.153
- What about parrots?
- Oh, yeah, definitely.

13:47.200 --> 13:50.078
<i>- Or a toucan. Oh, look at his beak.
- They're good colours.</i>

13:50.120 --> 13:52.031
Beautiful.

13:55.800 --> 13:57.518
So, are you going to get another bike?

13:57.560 --> 14:01.030
Oh, no, I couldn't replace my old lovely.
It's flown the nest now.

14:01.080 --> 14:02.991
Definitely going to learn to drive, though.

14:03.040 --> 14:04.553
- Going to book lessons?
- Might do.

14:05.280 --> 14:06.349
Might not.

14:06.400 --> 14:09.278
I told you, you're not learning to drive in my car.

14:12.280 --> 14:14.191
Nutter.

14:14.240 --> 14:17.118
- Chickens, we could do chickens.
- Chickens don't fly.

14:17.160 --> 14:20.391
<i>Lazy buggers.
What are we going to make, then?</i>

14:20.440 --> 14:23.034
- I don't know. What do you think?
- I don't know.

14:25.400 --> 14:27.038
- Where are they?
- Here.

14:27.080 --> 14:29.958
- That far apart, are they?
- Yeah. Don't poke me.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.911
Wasn't going near you.

14:34.280 --> 14:36.191
- Go on, then.
- Great.

14:41.200 --> 14:43.555
You should ask an adult to help you.

14:43.600 --> 14:45.511
I don't know any.

14:55.920 --> 14:59.310
- I think they're quite good.
- Yeah, what do you reckon?

15:01.920 --> 15:04.388
<i>- I think we could pull in these.
- Definitely.</i>

15:04.440 --> 15:06.590
- Pub?
- Yeah, hair of the dog.

15:06.640 --> 15:09.916
I'm ready. Put a bit of lippy on and away we go.

15:30.040 --> 15:32.429
<i>- Hi, Liz.
- Hi, Zoe. How are you?</i>

15:40.120 --> 15:41.633
Ooh.

15:44.480 --> 15:46.391
Didn't expect that one!

15:59.520 --> 16:00.589
Morning, Tina.

16:00.640 --> 16:06.112
Birds that live here in North America,
they fly all the way to South America.

16:06.160 --> 16:07.070
Yeah?

16:07.120 --> 16:09.793
<i>That's a journey and a half, isn't it?</i>

16:09.840 --> 16:13.276
But the... the biggest journey of them all
is of the arctic tern.

16:13.320 --> 16:15.276
Because he flies from the Arctic...

16:15.320 --> 16:21.759
Yeah? ...all the way - wow,
across the world - to the South Pole.

16:22.440 --> 16:23.668
Isn't that incredible?

16:23.720 --> 16:26.757
From the North to the South Pole
and that is... ssh!

16:26.800 --> 16:30.554
And that is 9,300 miles. That's right.

16:30.600 --> 16:32.556
Wow, wow.

16:39.200 --> 16:42.033
All right, Nick, do the other side now.

16:42.080 --> 16:44.753
<i>Here we go, look. No, don't pull it out.</i>

16:47.040 --> 16:51.556
What we can do... Shall we give him...
Shall we give him a few bits?

16:52.800 --> 16:55.360
Do you want to give him... I like that, I like that.

16:55.400 --> 16:57.470
<i>- Shall we give him one here?
- No.</i>

16:57.520 --> 16:58.589
<i>No?</i>

17:00.000 --> 17:02.833
He's got eyebrows, look.

17:02.880 --> 17:04.790
<i>- Yeah?
- Let me see.</i>

17:06.720 --> 17:09.393
I think that's brilliant. That's brilliant.

17:09.440 --> 17:11.271
Here we go.

17:11.319 --> 17:13.515
Shall I put some more yellow in that?
There we go.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.509
<i>What colours do you think
your feathers could be?</i>

17:16.560 --> 17:19.438
See, you could do a rainbow colour.
That's a good idea, isn't it?

17:19.480 --> 17:23.314
- I did a rainbow.
- Do a rainbow. Rainbows like parrots.

17:23.359 --> 17:24.952
<i>Don't put that on yet.</i>

17:28.160 --> 17:29.639
<i>Let's have a look.</i>

17:30.600 --> 17:32.795
Little bit more. What about the fringing?

17:32.840 --> 17:35.479
You could do a bit more
on the fringing there, couldn't you?

17:35.520 --> 17:38.159
Hungry? It's going to be lunch time soon.

17:38.200 --> 17:40.760
But I'm not a cook.
It's lunch time in a minute.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.313
We're going to lunch in a minute.

17:42.360 --> 17:44.271
You can wash your hands.

17:44.320 --> 17:45.958
Who's ready?

17:46.000 --> 17:47.911
Hey!

17:54.240 --> 17:57.596
Oh, wow! That is fantastic. Look at you go!

17:58.680 --> 18:02.514
Whooh! Flap your arms. Flap your wings.

18:07.600 --> 18:08.953
Bit dangerous, innit?

18:10.240 --> 18:11.514
What?

18:11.560 --> 18:13.278
Putting these over their heads.

18:13.320 --> 18:16.357
I'm trying to suffocate them.
That's my goal. Little buggers.

18:18.240 --> 18:20.708
<i>- They look great.
- How was your weekend?</i>

18:20.760 --> 18:22.910
- Crap.
- Oh, no, why's that, then?

18:22.960 --> 18:25.110
I didn't do much, just stayed in, really.

18:25.160 --> 18:26.434
It's the weekend, Tash.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.835
<i>- I know. I had a run-in with my mum.
- Did ya?</i>

18:28.880 --> 18:32.668
Mm. My sister was working Saturday.
I had to look after Jasmine.

18:32.720 --> 18:35.234
- How is she?
- That girl eats too much.

18:35.280 --> 18:36.429
Bless her.

18:36.480 --> 18:40.393
She ate three chicken legs and four jam tarts
and then wants to tell me she's starving.

18:40.440 --> 18:41.668
The little piglet.

18:41.720 --> 18:44.029
<i>- I dropped her off to my mum's.
- Yeah?</i>

18:44.080 --> 18:47.675
I said you've got to tell Sherryanne
that she needs to put this girl on a diet.

18:47.720 --> 18:49.199
You'll give her a complex, she's 7.

18:49.240 --> 18:52.710
All of a sudden Mum doesn't want to get
involved, for the first time in her life.

18:52.760 --> 18:56.036
Then I'm just leaving the house
and my two aunts arrive from Dollis Hill.

18:56.080 --> 18:57.115
Oh, no.

18:57.160 --> 19:00.869
So we get the Spanish Inquisition.
"Tash, you got a boyfriend?

19:00.920 --> 19:04.913
Are you getting married soon? Why don't you
give your mother another grandchild?

19:04.960 --> 19:07.190
You know she nearly 60. She getting old."

19:07.240 --> 19:08.229
Aargh!

19:08.280 --> 19:11.636
I was, like, "I haven't got a boyfriend.
I won't be getting married soon,

19:11.680 --> 19:14.433
and, no, I won't be investing
in a mortgage in the near future,

19:14.480 --> 19:15.959
thank you very much."

19:16.000 --> 19:18.514
- Then I just closed the door and left.
- End of.

19:38.560 --> 19:40.278
- You cooking?
- Yeah, are you cooking?

19:40.320 --> 19:42.038
I'm cooking with gas. What we having?

19:42.080 --> 19:43.672
- Food.
- That makes a change.

19:43.720 --> 19:45.199
- Are you hungry?
- I'm ravishing.

19:45.240 --> 19:47.435
- Aren't you just.
- Thank you.

19:47.480 --> 19:48.754
How did it go today?

19:48.800 --> 19:50.916
What, with my flying flock of feathered friends?

19:50.960 --> 19:53.030
Good, they loved it. Flapping away they were.

19:53.080 --> 19:54.479
- Were they?
- Yeah, bless them.

19:54.520 --> 19:57.910
I had to nip it in the bud with my lot
before they flew out the window.

19:57.960 --> 19:59.313
It was OK, though, was it?

19:59.360 --> 20:02.477
Oh, yeah, I played them Stravinsky after lunch
just to calm them down.

20:02.520 --> 20:05.239
- What did you play?
- The Rite Of Spring.

20:05.280 --> 20:07.032
I booked my first driving lesson.

20:07.080 --> 20:08.195
- Did you?
- Yeah.

20:08.240 --> 20:09.912
- When is it?
- 12 o'clock, Saturday.

20:09.960 --> 20:12.110
Excellent, well done you.

20:12.160 --> 20:14.720
- I'll set the table.
- Yeah, it's nearly ready.

20:26.240 --> 20:27.753
Yeah, I know.

20:27.800 --> 20:29.836
<i>I love the end of the week.
- You don't say.</i>

20:29.880 --> 20:31.313
- I do, actually.
- Do you?

20:31.360 --> 20:32.759
- Yeah.
- Oh.

20:32.800 --> 20:35.837
You know I take this dance class
on a Friday afternoon, the golden time.

20:35.880 --> 20:38.235
<i>I swear to God, half the kids are bigger than me.</i>

20:38.280 --> 20:42.478
- That's not hard, though, is it, eh, titch?
- No, I don't mean taller, I mean wider.

20:42.520 --> 20:43.873
You want to be careful, you know?

20:43.920 --> 20:47.833
You don't want the kids jumping about
expressing themselves. A bit dangerous.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.359
Yeah, you do all that on Friday,

20:49.400 --> 20:53.109
but then they spend the weekend indoors,
glued to their Nintendo DS.

20:53.160 --> 20:55.196
Totally. A couple of weeks ago
I came in Monday -

20:55.240 --> 20:57.435
I told Poppy - sat the kids down for carpet time,

20:57.480 --> 20:59.436
asked them what they did over the weekend.

20:59.480 --> 21:01.710
<i>Gorgeous weather.
Not one of them had been out.</i>

21:01.760 --> 21:04.115
They'd all been sitting at home
on their PlayStations.

21:04.160 --> 21:07.516
- You couldn't get them up off the carpet.
- When they got up, they were wheezing.

21:07.560 --> 21:10.757
- That's pollution for you.
- We always used to go to the park.

21:10.800 --> 21:13.792
<i>- A lot of them don't have parks to go to.
- Yeah, exactly.</i>

21:13.840 --> 21:15.671
But you don't need a park to go for a walk.

21:15.720 --> 21:17.551
If Mum and Dad don't go out, the kids don't.

21:17.600 --> 21:19.955
Parents are too frightened
to let their kids play out.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.639
Even a bit of green by the estate,
they don't let them play there.

21:22.680 --> 21:24.750
But it's hard for a lot of mums and dads, isn't it?

21:24.800 --> 21:27.598
They've had a hell of a week.
They're under pressure and stress.

21:27.640 --> 21:30.677
<i>- Tell me about it.
- They get back from work, if they work...</i>

21:30.720 --> 21:33.712
You know. A lot of them are
single mums, they're exhausted.

21:33.760 --> 21:37.639
It's understandable if they don't take
their kids out for a lovely picnic.

21:37.680 --> 21:41.195
It's not acceptable. Life's hard, but if
you want to find a way you find it, innit?

21:41.240 --> 21:43.515
<i>- Some parents can't be bothered.
- Yeah, I know.</i>

21:43.560 --> 21:46.438
So instead they let their kids
stay up half the night on chat rooms.

21:46.480 --> 21:48.596
- Yeah!
- Yeah, that's worrying.

21:48.640 --> 21:51.234
- Scary.
- Makes me so angry.

21:51.280 --> 21:54.397
A lot of seven-year-olds know more
about the internet than we do.

21:54.440 --> 21:56.670
At least people are talking about it. That's good.

21:56.720 --> 21:59.280
- Is it?
- Well, yeah. It means we're aware.

21:59.320 --> 22:01.834
I'm aware smoking's bad for me.
It doesn't mean I'll stop.

22:01.880 --> 22:03.950
<i>- As long as you know what will kill you.
- Thanks.</i>

22:04.000 --> 22:05.069
Any time.

22:05.120 --> 22:08.112
I know drinking's bad for me,
but, you know... I can't help myself.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.071
- Oh, shame.
- Cheers!

22:10.880 --> 22:14.839
Cheers, everyone! Here's to our livers
and all who drown in them.

22:15.680 --> 22:18.353
Careful, Poppy, you got your first
driving lesson tomorrow.

22:18.400 --> 22:20.118
Oh, yeah, quick, put that down.

22:20.160 --> 22:22.071
You don't want to mess up your blind spot.

22:22.120 --> 22:25.192
- Oh, that sounds good.
- Oh, it's here. How many fingers?

22:32.800 --> 22:35.268
- That must be for you.
- I'm so excited!

22:35.320 --> 22:37.880
You should do some deep breathing
before you get in the car.

22:37.920 --> 22:40.639
Ooh, can't see him. Wish me luck.

22:40.680 --> 22:44.070
Good luck. I'll keep the emergency
services on standby.

22:44.120 --> 22:46.839
<i>Any excuse, eh?
I know what you're like with firemen.</i>

22:51.040 --> 22:52.393
Hello. Scott?

22:53.840 --> 22:55.956
- Are you Poppy?
- That's me. Nice to you meet you.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.718
Right, the car's just here.

22:57.760 --> 22:59.990
They're not infected! What are you like?

23:00.040 --> 23:03.794
They're clean, I just washed them specially,
honest.

23:03.840 --> 23:05.671
- This it?
- You get in the passenger seat.

23:05.720 --> 23:09.076
- You know it's me learning to drive?
- We have to talk a few things through.

23:09.120 --> 23:11.190
Oh, have we? Fair enough. If you insist.

23:13.840 --> 23:17.037
- Did you choose this colour car?
- Make yourself comfortable.

23:17.080 --> 23:20.311
- Thank you. Is this your car?
- No, it's the company's car.

23:20.360 --> 23:22.669
- Oh, right, what's your car like, then?
- It is my car.

23:22.720 --> 23:24.995
You said it was the company's car.
Make your mind up.

23:25.040 --> 23:27.474
- Have you got your provisional licence?
- Yep!

23:28.320 --> 23:31.232
There you go. That's me on a bad day.

23:31.280 --> 23:33.111
- Is that your real name, Pauline?
- Right.

23:34.760 --> 23:37.558
- OK, everything seems to be in order.
- Does it? That's good.

23:37.600 --> 23:39.670
Now, have you ever had
a driving lesson before?

23:39.720 --> 23:43.508
Yeah. No, it wasn't really a lesson.
It was in a Cadillac in Miami.

23:43.560 --> 23:46.632
Bunny-hopped down the beach.
I was a bit pissed, it was hilarious.

23:46.680 --> 23:48.716
We won't be pissed when driving this car, OK?

23:48.760 --> 23:51.479
We're not going to bunny-hop.
We'll focus and concentrate.

23:51.520 --> 23:54.080
I'm going to take you to a spot
we take all learner drivers.

23:54.120 --> 23:56.588
- Are you?
- We'll go through the cockpit drill.

23:56.640 --> 23:59.712
- Oh, naughty.
- You'll listen and take responsibility.

23:59.760 --> 24:00.954
I'll see what I can do.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.798
- OK. Put your seat belt on.
- Will do, Captain Scott.

24:05.680 --> 24:07.477
Here we go, gigolo.

24:10.120 --> 24:12.793
- So you spoke to the office?
- I spoke to your boss.

24:12.840 --> 24:15.798
He's not my boss, I work for myself.
I'm my own man.

24:15.840 --> 24:19.549
But it's his car... or it's your car... Someone.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.594
And they told you the price - £22.50 an hour?

24:24.640 --> 24:26.358
That's right. Cheap as chips, you lot.

24:26.400 --> 24:28.436
<i>- We may be cheap but we're better.
- Are you?</i>

24:28.480 --> 24:31.472
You go with the big companies,
they use inexperienced instructors.

24:31.520 --> 24:32.669
They don't?

24:32.720 --> 24:34.551
<i>They've just passed their test and charge more.</i>

24:34.600 --> 24:35.271
Bastards.

24:35.320 --> 24:39.233
Us experienced instructors, we go
with small companies and charge less.

24:39.280 --> 24:42.352
<i>- That makes a lot of sense, that does.
- Cheapness is relative.</i>

24:42.400 --> 24:44.994
Yeah, it is. You're right. Bang-on!

24:46.120 --> 24:48.680
So, do you want the same time every week?

24:48.720 --> 24:49.835
Go on, then.

24:49.880 --> 24:52.678
- Do you or don't you? I need to know.
- Well, if you need to know.

24:52.720 --> 24:55.154
If it's good for you, it's good for me, Scott.

24:55.200 --> 24:57.111
OK, 12 o'clock every Saturday.

25:00.040 --> 25:04.192
- Do you like working Saturdays?
- I only work half day, Saturday.

25:04.240 --> 25:06.470
- Oh, that's good.
- You're my last pupil.

25:08.840 --> 25:12.799
What do you do for the rest of the day?
Are you going out tonight?

25:13.760 --> 25:15.876
I shall go home and read my book.

25:15.920 --> 25:18.798
Oh, it must be a good book. What is it?

25:19.960 --> 25:21.598
It's a book.

25:21.640 --> 25:23.756
Yeah, well, we worked that much out.

25:29.920 --> 25:32.434
- You see three pedals in front of you.
- Yeah, yeah.

25:32.480 --> 25:35.790
Will you put your left foot on the left-hand pedal
and push it all the way down?

25:35.840 --> 25:37.432
He's a bit frisky, isn't he?

25:37.480 --> 25:39.869
OK, Pauline.
Please take your boot off the pedal.

25:39.920 --> 25:43.515
Nobody's called me Pauline
since I was two years old. Makes me laugh.

25:43.560 --> 25:44.913
What am I supposed to call you?

25:44.960 --> 25:46.951
- Oh, how about Poppy?
- Poppy?

25:47.000 --> 25:48.399
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

25:48.440 --> 25:50.829
No, whatever turns you on, Scott. I don't mind.

25:50.880 --> 25:54.156
OK, Poppy. Your boots are inappropriate
for a driving lesson.

25:54.200 --> 25:56.919
- What's wrong with them?
- You can't control a car in high heels.

25:56.960 --> 26:00.316
I can do a lot in these.
You should see me in these on a dance floor.

26:00.360 --> 26:03.352
- They may be good on a dance floor.
- Not just good on a dance floor.

26:03.400 --> 26:04.435
They are "Oooh".

26:04.480 --> 26:06.232
They may be good in a Cadillac on a beach

26:06.280 --> 26:09.716
when you're pissed with your boyfriend,
but they're not suitable for driving.

26:09.760 --> 26:10.829
You're funny.

26:10.880 --> 26:13.269
Now, next week
I want you to bring flat-soled shoes.

26:13.320 --> 26:16.437
- I don't look any good in them.
- It's not how you look, it's how you drive.

26:16.480 --> 26:19.074
I'll see what I can rustle up for you, Scott.
Leave it to me.

26:19.120 --> 26:20.439
Right, you see three mirrors -

26:20.480 --> 26:22.869
your two side-view mirrors
and your rear-view mirror.

26:22.920 --> 26:25.673
- They make a golden triangle.
- Is that like the pubic triangle?

26:25.720 --> 26:29.395
It's a pyramid and at the top of it
you see the all-seeing eye - Enrahah.

26:29.440 --> 26:32.318
Can you repeat that, please? "En-ra-hah".

26:32.360 --> 26:34.430
- You talking about the eye of Lucifer?
- No!

26:34.480 --> 26:36.755
Cos I don't know if I want to look in there,
thank you.

26:36.800 --> 26:39.553
It's not Lucifer. There are
two fallen angels before Lucifer.

26:39.600 --> 26:43.275
- There is Enrahah, Raziel and Lucifer.
- I don't have them in my phone book.

26:43.320 --> 26:44.673
- Bear with me.
- Where is he?

26:44.720 --> 26:46.119
- Bear with me.
- I can't see him.

26:46.160 --> 26:47.593
- It's a teaching tool.
- Is it?

26:47.640 --> 26:49.756
Let me explain something to you about teaching.

26:49.800 --> 26:53.588
The teacher's job is to bring out good habits
in the pupil and to get rid of bad habits.

26:53.640 --> 26:56.200
He does that through
frequent repetitive thinking.

26:56.240 --> 26:58.629
And he does that by creating clear
and distinct images

26:58.680 --> 27:00.272
that are easy for the pupil to retain.

27:00.320 --> 27:02.231
- Oh, does he, now?
- Yes.

27:03.360 --> 27:05.316
Don't worry, it's burnt in there.

27:05.360 --> 27:08.033
You remember. You will remember
Enrahah till the day you die

27:08.080 --> 27:09.399
and I will have done my job.

27:09.440 --> 27:12.318
Why don't you have something nice up there
like a giant strawberry?

27:12.360 --> 27:13.952
Believe you me, it works.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.797
- OK, stop!
- What am I doing now?

27:15.840 --> 27:18.274
Please take your hand off the gear.
Off the gear stick!

27:18.320 --> 27:19.799
- All right.
- Foot off the pedal.

27:19.840 --> 27:22.559
- I'm not touching anything.
- Let me explain to you something.

27:22.600 --> 27:25.512
This car is my livelihood.
This car is how I earn my living.

27:25.560 --> 27:27.676
- I don't know how you earn your living.
- Yeah.

27:27.720 --> 27:30.518
But if I walked into your pub
or your discotheque or your club

27:30.560 --> 27:33.028
and I walked up to the DJ
and I scratched all his records,

27:33.080 --> 27:34.354
or I smashed all the glasses,

27:34.400 --> 27:38.552
and I said, "I'm sorry, I didn't know
what I was doing," that wouldn't be acceptable.

27:38.600 --> 27:40.318
There is only one problem with that.

27:40.360 --> 27:43.716
I don't own a bar or a disco.
I'm just a primary school teacher.

27:46.920 --> 27:48.831
- Are you?
- Afraid so, kiddo.

27:49.880 --> 27:51.677
Are you a Satanist, Scott?

27:51.720 --> 27:55.474
- No, in fact I'm exactly the opposite.
- Are you the Pope, then?

27:55.520 --> 27:58.193
- That's the same thing.
- Is it? Does he know that?

27:58.920 --> 28:03.152
Right, you have three pedals, A, B, C.
Accelerator, brake and clutch.

28:03.200 --> 28:04.428
# Talking about...
Lovely.

28:04.480 --> 28:05.708
- Good.
- Yeah.

28:06.840 --> 28:08.193
What's he like?

28:08.240 --> 28:09.878
- You'd love him.
- Would I?

28:09.920 --> 28:12.036
He made me laugh. He was funny.

28:12.080 --> 28:14.036
What? Like funny "Ha ha" or funny peculiar?

28:14.080 --> 28:16.913
- Bit of both, actually.
- So, what happened, then?

28:16.960 --> 28:19.235
- He shouted at me.
- What? He gave you a telling off?

28:19.280 --> 28:21.236
He's a little bit uptight. Just a little bit.

28:21.280 --> 28:23.874
- Bet you wound him up.
- Might set you up with him.

28:23.920 --> 28:25.831
- Is he fit?
- Yeah.

28:25.880 --> 28:27.950
No, he's not fit at all. Just your type.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.753
What do I get out of it?
- You get a shag whenever you want.

28:30.800 --> 28:32.438
When was the last time that happened?

28:32.480 --> 28:36.951
Who's fault's that, eh?
Where are you going? Suzy!

28:37.000 --> 28:38.911
- You all right?
- All right?

28:38.960 --> 28:40.598
- What's going on?
- Come on.

28:40.640 --> 28:42.551
- You shouting at my little sister?
- No.

28:42.600 --> 28:44.591
- Doesn't look like it, does it?
- Poppy!

28:44.640 --> 28:46.551
- Where are you going?
- Fuck off!

28:46.600 --> 28:49.114
Not coming with us, apparently. Adios.

28:51.360 --> 28:53.271
Suze!

29:18.480 --> 29:20.391
Ooh.

29:22.040 --> 29:23.473
- Morning, Poppy.
- All right?

29:23.520 --> 29:25.750
- What's the matter?
- Buggered my back, haven't I?

29:25.800 --> 29:27.472
- Looks like it.
- Trampolining.

29:27.520 --> 29:30.034
- Trampolining? Really?
- Yeah, I go every week.

29:30.080 --> 29:31.752
- What? After school?
- I love it.

29:31.800 --> 29:32.596
Great.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.551
You've got to keep the muscles a-pumping.

29:34.600 --> 29:36.716
- Cos I've just started flamenco.
- You haven't?

29:36.760 --> 29:39.638
- It's fantastic.
- I've always wanted to do it. Bit of that.

29:39.680 --> 29:40.908
- Careful.
- I'm all right.

29:40.960 --> 29:42.757
- Come along, if you want.
- When is it?

29:42.800 --> 29:44.392
Every Tuesday, 6:30.

29:44.440 --> 29:46.431
- Well, see how you feel.
- All right.

29:53.360 --> 29:55.271
- Morning, Leanne.
- Morning.

29:57.160 --> 29:58.798
Stink of urine round here.

29:58.840 --> 30:01.070
- I can't smell anything.
- Have you peed your pants?

30:01.120 --> 30:02.155
Yeah, sorry.

30:02.200 --> 30:04.031
- You're a naughty girl.
- Tell me about it.

30:04.080 --> 30:05.035
Ow!

30:05.080 --> 30:06.274
- You all right?
- Yeah.

30:06.320 --> 30:07.548
Come on, we're nearly there.

30:07.600 --> 30:10.797
- Have you lost your sense of smell?
- Yeah, smoking dulls your senses.

30:10.840 --> 30:13.035
- And your brain. Here we go.
- Go on, then.

30:19.040 --> 30:20.268
Done that.

30:20.320 --> 30:21.753
- All done?
- Yeah, thanks.

30:21.800 --> 30:22.949
OK.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.911
Take care.

30:24.960 --> 30:27.599
- OK, who have we got next?
- Poppy Cross.

30:27.640 --> 30:28.516
Thanks.

30:28.560 --> 30:30.391
Poppy? No, I'm Zoe. Nice to meet you.

30:30.440 --> 30:32.749
No, I'm Poppy, sorry about her.
Don't know who she is.

30:32.800 --> 30:34.597
- My name's Ezra.
- Hello, Ezra.

30:34.640 --> 30:37.029
- You want to just follow me upstairs?
- Yeah.

30:38.200 --> 30:40.509
- You're big, aren't you?
- Good luck!

30:40.560 --> 30:43.313
- Just take your time.
- What are you going to do to me?

30:43.360 --> 30:45.590
Ooh!

30:45.640 --> 30:47.756
Makes me laugh.

30:47.800 --> 30:50.394
OK, I'm just going to feel the muscles
in your back.

30:50.440 --> 30:52.749
- Right.
- And you let me know where the pain is.

30:52.800 --> 30:54.711
I'll send you a text.

30:56.240 --> 30:58.356
Strong fingers.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.195
That tickles.

31:02.880 --> 31:05.348
- Oooh! Bang on the money.
- OK.

31:05.400 --> 31:08.278
- Ow...
- And this side?

31:08.320 --> 31:09.878
Yeah.

31:11.360 --> 31:14.989
OK. Do you want to reach down to your side
as if you're picking something up?

31:15.040 --> 31:17.076
Picking chickens.

31:17.120 --> 31:19.509
No, sorry. I can't do that. Ow! Oooh.

31:25.200 --> 31:26.918
Is it your back?

31:26.960 --> 31:27.949
Sorry?

31:28.000 --> 31:30.719
Cos it can affect everything, can't it?

31:37.480 --> 31:39.391
Like your mood and everything.

31:43.440 --> 31:46.512
- Nice action.
- Lie on your back for me, please.

31:46.560 --> 31:50.075
Must get one of these. Come in very handy.

31:50.120 --> 31:51.473
Oooh! Ow.

31:51.520 --> 31:55.752
OK, I'm just going to ask you to roll
yourself onto your side, facing me.

31:55.800 --> 31:57.358
You don't ask for much do you, eh?

31:58.400 --> 32:00.630
I'm going to feel the muscles in your spine again.

32:03.400 --> 32:04.879
Ooh.

32:08.800 --> 32:09.676
Oh!

32:09.720 --> 32:12.951
# What-d'you-ma-call-it,
ding dang dilly dilly da da, hoo-hoo!

32:13.000 --> 32:14.353
OK.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.470
All right, lie back.

32:18.160 --> 32:19.388
There we go.

32:19.440 --> 32:22.079
There's a joint in your spine that's jammed up.

32:22.120 --> 32:23.314
Oh, no.

32:23.360 --> 32:25.555
- Would you like me to release it?
- Is it serious?

32:25.600 --> 32:27.955
- It's not too bad.
- What you going to do? Will it hurt?

32:28.000 --> 32:29.911
It may for a few days.

32:32.240 --> 32:35.516
<i>- Go on, then. Go for your life.
- Are you sure?</i>

32:35.560 --> 32:37.039
If you're quick.

32:37.080 --> 32:42.074
OK. I'm going to roll you over and you'll
feel a short sharp click in your back.

32:43.080 --> 32:46.038
OK? Breathe in. And...

32:46.080 --> 32:48.958
Oh. Wait a minute.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.991
OK. Are you ready?

32:51.040 --> 32:52.268
Yeah.

32:52.320 --> 32:54.470
OK, breathe in...

32:54.520 --> 32:57.159
- OK.
- And release.

32:57.200 --> 32:59.634
Oh, hoochy coochy ga-la!

32:59.680 --> 33:02.148
OK. Just relax for me.

33:03.640 --> 33:05.596
Didn't know you were going to do that.

33:05.640 --> 33:07.596
Ooh.

33:07.640 --> 33:09.596
<i>Just relax and breathe normally.</i>

33:13.000 --> 33:15.958
<i>OK, would you like to sit up for me?</i>

33:16.000 --> 33:17.911
Yeah.

33:23.760 --> 33:26.399
Will this be a regular occurrence,
chopping and changing?

33:26.440 --> 33:29.398
- Sorry, Scott. Something came up.
- I've got a life too, you know.

33:29.440 --> 33:32.079
- I had to make an appointment.
- Isn't this an appointment?

33:32.120 --> 33:33.838
I couldn't help it.

33:33.880 --> 33:36.235
The road to hell is paved with good intentions.

33:36.280 --> 33:38.191
Sounds like fun.

33:40.560 --> 33:42.039
Having a bad day, are you?

33:42.080 --> 33:44.674
<i>- I had a bad pupil this morning.
- Oh, no, what did he do?</i>

33:44.720 --> 33:46.676
He was late, he refused to pay his money.

33:46.720 --> 33:48.233
He slammed the door and swore at me.

33:48.280 --> 33:51.238
<i>- You shout at him, did you?
- I drove off, I'm not teaching him again.</i>

33:51.280 --> 33:53.555
- You show him.
- He's rude, he's arrogant,

33:53.600 --> 33:56.239
he's overconfident and he's too street.

33:56.280 --> 33:57.349
You don't like that.

33:57.400 --> 33:59.994
He's been overindulged
and encouraged to express himself.

34:00.040 --> 34:01.917
Express himself! Chop his hands off!

34:01.960 --> 34:03.791
<i>Do you know what it means when they do that?</i>

34:03.840 --> 34:05.558
- Go on.
- How little do they know.

34:05.600 --> 34:07.033
How little do their mothers know.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.632
And they smell.

34:11.639 --> 34:14.108
It's not easy being you, is it? Eh?

34:25.280 --> 34:27.350
Fancy meeting you here, hey?

34:28.520 --> 34:30.715
You don't have to laugh, I'll let you off.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.592
OK, gently, gently, gently, gently.

34:50.639 --> 34:52.072
- Steady progression.
- Sorry.

34:52.120 --> 34:55.317
Take your foot off the brake.
There's no need to put your foot on the brake.

34:55.360 --> 34:57.590
- Do you know what's doing that?
- What is doing that?

34:57.640 --> 35:00.393
- Your boots. Your boots are doing that.
- No, I was taking my time.

35:00.440 --> 35:02.795
- I panicked.
- Your boots, they're inappropriate.

35:02.840 --> 35:03.829
OK, on.

35:08.880 --> 35:11.155
Poppy, come on.
Let's pick up some speed. OK?

35:11.200 --> 35:14.317
<i>- Don't shout at me, Scott.
- Well, don't dilly dally, let's just go. OK.</i>

35:14.360 --> 35:16.920
- I'm just learning.
- Next left-hand turn. OK?

35:16.960 --> 35:19.315
- You panic me.
- So, mirror, signal, manoeuvre.

35:19.360 --> 35:21.510
<i>- Gets me right there.
- Enrahah, Enrahah.</i>

35:21.560 --> 35:24.358
Both hands on the wheel, Enrahah. Enrahah.

35:24.400 --> 35:26.231
I don't like that, gives me the creeps.

35:26.280 --> 35:29.556
<i>OK, Poppy. Indicate. Mirror, signal, manoeuvre.</i>

35:29.600 --> 35:31.636
<i>- Indicate.
- Signal, OK.</i>

35:31.680 --> 35:33.875
- How am I doing?
- Foot down on the brake. Clutch.

35:33.920 --> 35:37.595
You don't want to stall. OK, find your biting point
and peep and creep.

35:37.640 --> 35:39.517
- First gear. Peep and creep.
- First gear.

35:39.560 --> 35:41.915
- Peep and creep.
- Peeping and a-creeping.

35:49.560 --> 35:52.996
- When you get to the end of the road...
- Ooh, he's nice.

35:53.040 --> 35:56.112
When we get to the end of the road...
Can you please focus on the driving?

35:56.160 --> 35:58.196
Enrahah, Enrahah.

35:58.240 --> 36:00.435
<i>- Enrahah. OK!
- I... That's a bit weird.</i>

36:00.480 --> 36:02.630
<i>Foot on the brake, clutch. You don't want to stall.</i>

36:02.680 --> 36:05.478
<i>Find your bite.
Can you feel you're slightly on a hill?</i>

36:05.520 --> 36:07.317
- No.
- OK, put the hand brake on.

36:07.360 --> 36:10.796
Find your biting point.
OK, lock your door. Lock your door.

36:10.840 --> 36:13.229
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Poppy, there's two of them.

36:13.280 --> 36:15.157
<i>- Are you taking the piss?
- Lock your door.</i>

36:15.200 --> 36:18.829
- OK, let's go. Let's go, Poppy, let's go.
- I don't believe you just said that.

36:18.880 --> 36:20.791
Let's go. On you go. On you go.

36:20.840 --> 36:23.832
- Let's go that way.
- Poppy! Poppy, let's go!

36:23.880 --> 36:27.714
- We're on a bend. Now, let's go.
- Blimey, O'Reilly.

36:27.760 --> 36:30.877
Right, on you go. Keep to the left
of the centre of the road.

36:37.120 --> 36:41.352
Usual time next week? 12 o'clock?
You can check it if you like.

36:41.400 --> 36:43.311
See you.

36:44.720 --> 36:46.711
Cheerio.

36:51.520 --> 36:53.431
All right, doggie?

36:58.200 --> 37:00.077
<i>Here's another one.
- Yeah.</i>

37:00.120 --> 37:02.236
Circle, completely red.

37:02.280 --> 37:03.793
What? Like a tomato?

37:03.840 --> 37:06.798
For instance. White horizontal line.

37:06.840 --> 37:08.398
Give us a clue, Zoe.

37:08.440 --> 37:11.876
Horizontal, parallel to the horizon.

37:11.920 --> 37:13.194
Thank you, Miss Marsh.

37:13.240 --> 37:16.596
- You're welcome.
- So, it's not... up and down like a yoyo.

37:16.640 --> 37:18.153
- No.
- Right.

37:18.200 --> 37:19.758
- What is it?
- Vertical.

37:19.800 --> 37:22.155
- No, you muppet, the sign.
- That'd be "no entry".

37:22.200 --> 37:24.509
- For what?
- For black boys on bicycles.

37:24.560 --> 37:27.597
- Don't get me started on that again.
- It just popped out of his mouth.

37:27.640 --> 37:31.428
- You can always get another instructor.
- Yeah, I know. See how it goes, eh?

37:31.480 --> 37:34.040
- Ask me another.
- This is also a red circle.

37:34.080 --> 37:36.275
- Yeah.
- Black car - this isn't a racist thing.

37:36.320 --> 37:39.312
- Glad to hear it.
- Next to the black car is a red car.

37:39.360 --> 37:41.954
That's Mr Golly overtaking Noddy.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.150
- Enrahah.
- Enrahah to you.

37:44.200 --> 37:46.919
- What is it?
- No overtaking.

37:46.960 --> 37:49.428
- Enrahah.
- Enrahah-ha-ha!

37:49.480 --> 37:51.789
- He sounds like a nutter.
- He is a nutter.

37:51.840 --> 37:54.513
- How's your back?
- It's all right, actually. He sorted it.

37:54.560 --> 37:56.994
Magic fingers. He was sweet, wasn't he?

37:57.040 --> 37:58.951
He was fit.

37:59.640 --> 38:01.835
Octagonal sign with "stop" written in it.

38:01.880 --> 38:03.871
- Stop!
- All right, then.

38:08.880 --> 38:10.791
Who's going to blink first?

38:19.880 --> 38:23.031
- Do you want a cup of tea?
- Yes, please.

38:24.440 --> 38:28.433
No, you have the lasagna tonight.
We can finish the chicken tomorrow.

38:28.480 --> 38:31.119
Look, I can't talk now. See you later.

38:31.840 --> 38:34.149
- Do you think we'll make it?
- Depends on the traffic.

38:34.200 --> 38:37.715
Should be all right. Ooh, that's my back!

38:54.440 --> 38:57.477
Hey, come in, ladies, as quick as you can.

38:57.520 --> 39:00.398
<i>Do want to put your bags,
and there's a couple of places.</i>

39:00.440 --> 39:01.668
- Sorry we're late.
- Sorry.

39:01.720 --> 39:05.679
No problem, it's very Spanish to be late.
Take your places. Then we can start.

39:05.720 --> 39:07.631
Here.

39:10.320 --> 39:13.357
I was just introducing myself
to the peoples what don't know me.

39:13.400 --> 39:16.039
It's lovely to see you again
and lovely you bring a friend.

39:16.080 --> 39:17.798
Welcome in my class.

39:17.840 --> 39:23.073
So, my name is Rositta Santos
and I'm coming from Sevilla in Spain.

39:23.120 --> 39:26.396
Or Seville, what you say here.

39:27.160 --> 39:33.838
<i>What is famous for our bullfighting,
our beautiful oranges -</i>

39:33.880 --> 39:39.318
what your English peoples
turn into disgusting marmalade.

39:39.360 --> 39:41.874
<i>Are you going to keep
those sunglasses on, then?</i>

39:41.920 --> 39:46.835
And also is the birth home of flamenco.

39:46.880 --> 39:48.393
Sorry.

40:03.200 --> 40:06.192
Then everybody is ready... I hope.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.833
<i>So, feet in parallel. Hip distance apart.</i>

40:11.840 --> 40:16.436
Pulling up from the waist.
Opening across the chest.

40:16.480 --> 40:19.916
<i>Shoulder blades drawing down to the spine.</i>

40:19.960 --> 40:21.871
Arms relaxed.

40:23.800 --> 40:26.075
And taking the head over to your right.

40:27.800 --> 40:30.394
<i>Feeling that lovely stretch at the neck.</i>

40:33.640 --> 40:35.073
Then to the left.

40:35.840 --> 40:37.751
Not very flamenco, is it?

40:38.920 --> 40:40.797
<i>To the right.</i>

40:41.440 --> 40:43.829
<i>Bringing the head back to the centre.</i>

40:44.640 --> 40:46.551
<i>And relax. Lovely.</i>

40:47.680 --> 40:50.353
So, guys. We're going to reverse the abs now.

40:50.400 --> 40:52.470
Right foot in front.

40:53.160 --> 40:56.357
<i>Lifting up from the elbows
like they got strings attached.</i>

40:56.400 --> 40:57.913
<i>Like little Pinocchio.</i>

40:57.960 --> 40:59.791
Lifting, lifting.

40:59.840 --> 41:02.479
Keeping the shoulders down.
Arms above the head.

41:02.520 --> 41:05.910
<i>Framing the face. Here I am...proud.</i>

41:06.680 --> 41:11.435
Then bringing the arms down in front.
Pressing, pressing, pressing.

41:11.480 --> 41:16.190
<i>Keeping the tension,
keeping the strength, but fluid as well.</i>

41:16.240 --> 41:21.872
Then lifting up again from the elbows.
Like the eagle spreading his wings.

41:21.920 --> 41:25.196
<i>Beautiful, angry, ferocious.</i>

41:26.560 --> 41:29.791
And, guys, when you're lifting up
your eagle wings,

41:29.840 --> 41:36.154
<i>remember that this dance comes from the pain,
from the suffering</i>

41:36.200 --> 41:37.918
of los gitanos...

41:37.960 --> 41:40.633
erm... what you say, "the gypsies".

41:40.680 --> 41:43.956
I know this word not politically correct,

41:44.000 --> 41:47.549
but these guys,
they been squashed down by society

41:47.600 --> 41:50.990
<i>for centuries, centuries, and they say,</i>

41:51.040 --> 41:54.112
"We don't need this. We got pride.

41:54.160 --> 41:55.991
We got dignity.

41:56.040 --> 41:58.998
We got heart. We got flamenco."

41:59.840 --> 42:03.958
They say, "This... my space."

42:04.000 --> 42:06.036
<i>My space.</i>

42:06.080 --> 42:07.911
My space.

42:07.960 --> 42:10.838
My space. Everybody... do this. One, two.

42:10.880 --> 42:12.711
My space.

42:12.760 --> 42:14.591
- And again.
- My space!

42:14.640 --> 42:16.517
- Vamos! Vamos!
- My space!

42:16.560 --> 42:18.437
- And again.
- My space!

42:18.480 --> 42:20.630
<i>- Vamos, vamos.
- My space!</i>

42:20.680 --> 42:22.511
- With meaning.
- My space!

42:22.560 --> 42:23.675
But, guys.

42:23.720 --> 42:24.789
My space!

42:24.840 --> 42:27.149
- One more time.
- My space!

42:27.200 --> 42:29.589
- With expression.
- My space!

42:29.640 --> 42:31.676
- I don't believe it.
- My space!

42:31.720 --> 42:34.473
<i>OK, guys. I'll give you two counts in.</i>

42:34.520 --> 42:38.399
<i>Then we're going to stamp
and clap the compás, OK?</i>

42:38.440 --> 42:39.668
<i>Uno, dos.</i>

42:46.360 --> 42:50.558
Guys, guys, guys. What are you doing?

42:51.520 --> 42:54.751
Where is the passion? Where is the revenge?
Where is the blood?

42:54.800 --> 42:56.153
This is flamenco.

42:56.200 --> 42:59.158
That clapping, so polite.
It's like the end of the opera.

42:59.200 --> 43:02.590
"Excuse me, how many sugar
you want in your tea?"

43:03.680 --> 43:07.309
This woman been spending
every Wednesday afternoon for a year

43:07.360 --> 43:09.715
with your husband, in a hotel in Paddington.

43:09.760 --> 43:13.639
This guy been having an affair
for five years with your best friend.

43:14.880 --> 43:18.839
Your boyfriend, what you gave your love,
your spirit, for five years

43:18.880 --> 43:24.591
betrays you with a Swedish bitch,
what is 22 years old.

43:24.640 --> 43:28.599
You want to kill him.
You want to cut off his balls.

43:28.640 --> 43:33.191
He's such a bastard! I hate him!

43:34.040 --> 43:35.951
Are you all right?

43:46.600 --> 43:48.875
Didn't bargain for that. That was something else.

43:48.920 --> 43:50.399
I know, but all credit to her.

43:50.440 --> 43:52.556
She picked herself up. She came straight back.

43:52.600 --> 43:55.319
As if nothing had happened.
Like a little fireball, wasn't she?

43:55.360 --> 43:58.113
- Not a grain of sentimentality.
- No, wipe the tears.

43:58.160 --> 43:59.752
Bless her. I wanted to give her a hug.

43:59.800 --> 44:01.392
I don't think she'd appreciate that.

44:01.440 --> 44:04.159
No! "This is my space, get off me!"

44:04.200 --> 44:07.431
Leaves a nasty taste, though,
exploding her heart all over the floor.

44:07.480 --> 44:09.436
- Then it was "put that away".
- Stick that in a box.

44:09.480 --> 44:11.232
- Get it out another time.
- Perhaps never.

44:11.280 --> 44:12.918
<i>- You'll be lucky.
- I know.</i>

44:12.960 --> 44:15.474
She must be going through some shit,
though, mustn't she?

44:15.520 --> 44:19.672
<i>- She's actually a good teacher.
- Oh, yeah, definitely.</i>

44:19.720 --> 44:21.199
She's going to burn herself out.

44:21.240 --> 44:24.277
I believed her when she said
she'd cut off his balls, though. Didn't you?

44:24.320 --> 44:26.629
I don't expect the guys will be back
next week, then?

44:26.680 --> 44:28.955
No! Snip, snip.

44:30.040 --> 44:32.110
- How's your love life?
- How is my love life?

44:32.160 --> 44:33.639
<i>- Nothing doing?
- Not a sausage.</i>

44:33.680 --> 44:35.955
- Are you OK with that?
- Oh, yeah.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.274
<i>- Good for you.
- Cheers.</i>

44:37.320 --> 44:39.117
Cheers.

44:40.800 --> 44:43.314
- How's your Beth?
- Darren's dumped her.

44:43.360 --> 44:44.429
Oh, no.

44:44.480 --> 44:46.710
Just before her 18th birthday. "Thanks, Darren."

44:46.760 --> 44:48.830
<i>- Why do men always do that, eh?
- I know.</i>

44:48.880 --> 44:52.111
Christmas, Valentine's Day.
Boom! They're gone.

44:52.160 --> 44:55.277
- I hope he won't turn up to the party.
- Name off the list.

44:55.320 --> 44:58.198
I'm looking at her and thinking,
"Don't call him. Don't call him."

44:58.240 --> 45:01.198
- "Don't do it, Beth. Don't do it."
- You can't say anything, though.

45:01.240 --> 45:04.869
- You've got to let them get on with it.
- You can't help being protective.

45:05.800 --> 45:07.950
Of course, she's got her A levels coming up.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.991
Fingers crossed, she's going to Manchester.

45:10.040 --> 45:12.759
- Fantastic. What she want to do there?
- Sociology.

45:12.800 --> 45:15.837
- Lovely.
- I hope she'll take a gap year. Travel.

45:15.880 --> 45:17.438
That's important, see the world.

45:17.480 --> 45:20.631
- I think so. Cos I never got the chance.
- Nor me.

45:20.680 --> 45:22.830
- You made up for it later, though.
- Didn't I just?

45:22.880 --> 45:24.916
<i>- Where were you?
- All over the place.</i>

45:24.960 --> 45:28.714
Taught in this school in Thailand, six months.
Me and Zoe.

45:28.760 --> 45:32.469
Started off in Australia.
Zoe's got relations in Melbourne and Sydney.

45:32.520 --> 45:37.355
Bali, Java, Malaysia, Vietnam - beautiful.
Then Thailand.

45:37.400 --> 45:39.118
Fabulous.

45:39.160 --> 45:43.278
Amazing. Gorgeous kids.
Loved learning. 60 in a class.

45:43.320 --> 45:44.548
<i>- 60?
- Oh, yeah.</i>

45:44.600 --> 45:46.670
Fantastic. Great challenge.

45:46.720 --> 45:48.551
<i>- And for them.
- Especially for them.</i>

45:48.600 --> 45:49.589
Yeah.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.833
<i>- Do you want another one?
- I'd love to but I'm driving, aren't I?</i>

45:54.880 --> 45:57.678
Oh, of course you are.
Got to be good. Work tomorrow.

46:47.520 --> 46:49.397
Poppy, this is your third driving lesson.

46:49.440 --> 46:51.954
<i>- I'm getting quite good, aren't I?
- No, you're not good.</i>

46:52.000 --> 46:54.355
You're smug. You're too easily distracted.

46:54.400 --> 46:57.551
You're distracted by squirrels,
by dogs, by children in the park,

46:57.600 --> 47:00.831
by old ladies in surgical stockings,
by half-naked men in their gardens.

47:00.880 --> 47:04.190
- Oh, well, he was quite fit, wasn't he?
- No, he wasn't fit, he had a paunch.

47:04.240 --> 47:07.789
<i>- I didn't know you were checking it out.
- Keep your eyes focused on the road.</i>

47:07.840 --> 47:11.276
This car is a lethal weapon.
Pay attention or you'll kill somebody.

47:11.320 --> 47:13.151
Keep to the left of the centre of the road.

47:13.200 --> 47:16.909
Oh, come on, Scott. How often do you
see a squirrel sending a text like that?

47:16.960 --> 47:20.794
<i>- Left turn. Mirror, signal, Enrahah.
- Sending a little text.</i>

47:20.880 --> 47:22.359
Enrahah!

47:25.600 --> 47:29.275
I can't believe you're a teacher,
that you're in charge of 40 children.

47:29.320 --> 47:31.436
It took me by surprise, to be honest. It's 30.

47:31.480 --> 47:33.710
30. You have no respect for order.

47:33.760 --> 47:36.718
You are arrogant, you are disruptive
and you celebrate chaos.

47:36.760 --> 47:39.320
<i>- I slipped through the net, didn't I?
- No, you are the net.</i>

47:39.360 --> 47:41.396
Believe you me, Poppy, you are the net.

47:41.440 --> 47:44.477
OK, we're going to do the next left turn.
Mirror, signal, manoeuvre.

47:44.520 --> 47:48.399
- Enrahah. Keep with it, Poppy.
- Oooh. Don't like this corner.

47:48.440 --> 47:50.510
Get away from the bend.
Get away from the bend.

47:50.560 --> 47:53.552
Do you remember the pyramid?
Do you remember the shape of the pyramid?

47:53.600 --> 47:54.669
<i>- Enrahah.
- No.</i>

47:54.720 --> 47:56.756
Enrahah is the eye at the top of the pyramid.

47:56.800 --> 47:58.358
I'm talking about the bottom of it.

47:58.400 --> 48:01.551
Those at the bottom of the pyramid
are kept in total ignorance

48:01.600 --> 48:04.353
of what those at the top of the pyramid
are achieving. Enrahah.

48:04.400 --> 48:05.719
Where are you on the pyramid?

48:05.760 --> 48:08.638
- I'm outside the pyramid, looking in.
- Of course you are.

48:08.680 --> 48:12.468
Where are you? That is more to the point.
Where are you and your children?

48:12.520 --> 48:15.830
<i>- Where are we all, eh?
- The next left turn. Enrahah.</i>

48:15.880 --> 48:19.077
- Did you like school, Scott?
- I'm afraid it didn't agree with me.

48:19.120 --> 48:21.031
Oh, that's a shame.

48:21.840 --> 48:24.434
Let me tell you something
about the education system.

48:24.480 --> 48:27.836
- Oh, go on, then.
- It produces left brain prisoners.

48:27.880 --> 48:29.472
- Do you know what that means?
- I do.

48:29.520 --> 48:31.715
Well, I'll tell you. Our brain has two sides.

48:31.760 --> 48:35.309
The left brain and the right brain.
The left brain... Keep going, keep going.

48:35.360 --> 48:37.476
The left brain is information, data. It's dead.

48:37.520 --> 48:40.557
The right brain is individuality.
It's where the soul lies.

48:40.600 --> 48:44.479
And the education system, it works like this -
"I will give you a world view.

48:44.520 --> 48:47.876
And if you repeat my world view,
if you reconfirm my world view,

48:47.920 --> 48:51.708
you will pass your exams and you will
go higher and higher and higher

48:51.760 --> 48:54.194
and you will become a policeman, a magistrate,

48:54.240 --> 48:58.358
a lawyer, a general, a politician,
and you will be happy and you will succeed.

48:58.400 --> 48:59.958
But if you think for yourself,

49:00.000 --> 49:03.231
if you think outside of the box,
then you will be unhappy and you will fail."

49:03.280 --> 49:08.479
That's how the education system works.
Left turn. Enrahah. Signal. Enrahah.

49:10.960 --> 49:12.552
Were you bullied at school, Scott?

49:15.040 --> 49:17.554
We're going to do the next left turn. Enrahah.

49:17.600 --> 49:20.114
Kids, they can be cruel, can't they, eh?

49:23.280 --> 49:25.111
Nick!

49:27.840 --> 49:31.230
Nick, what's going on? Eh?

49:31.280 --> 49:33.191
Are you all right, Charlie?

49:33.240 --> 49:35.276
Yeah, I could see that. What's going on, eh?

49:39.200 --> 49:41.111
<i>Venga, venga!</i>

49:42.880 --> 49:44.632
<i>Don't bounce.</i>

49:44.680 --> 49:46.398
<i>Keep pounding.</i>

49:48.280 --> 49:49.918
<i>Facing front.</i>

49:52.120 --> 49:54.031
<i>Look in front of us.</i>

49:56.440 --> 49:58.954
<i>It's not salsa. Keep straight.</i>

50:02.160 --> 50:04.469
<i>Venga, mátalo.</i>

50:04.520 --> 50:06.829
<i>Uno, dos, tres. Uno, dos, tres.</i>

50:06.880 --> 50:11.032
<i>Face the front. Don't look at me.
Uno, dos, tres. Keep it pounding.</i>

50:11.600 --> 50:15.195
Uno, dos, tres. Uno, dos, tres.
Uno, dos, tres. Uno, dos, tres.

50:18.000 --> 50:19.877
Bravo, everybody.

50:20.680 --> 50:26.038
I have to tell you, I am slightly impressed.

50:26.080 --> 50:30.676
Much better than last week.
Though of course this is not difficult.

50:30.720 --> 50:32.756
And still could improve.

50:32.800 --> 50:34.870
<i>But...it will do.</i>

50:34.920 --> 50:37.115
For now.

50:37.880 --> 50:40.155
<i>Be quiet. Get on with it.</i>

50:40.800 --> 50:44.349
<i>What are you writing about? All about you?</i>

50:44.400 --> 50:46.311
That's lovely, Savannah.

50:47.880 --> 50:50.917
<i>Good girl. Married with a prince, yeah?</i>

50:51.960 --> 50:55.157
There we are. You carry on
with your work, there's a good...

50:56.720 --> 50:59.075
Yeah, you carry on. You draw a picture now.

50:59.120 --> 51:01.395
Hold on. What's going on?
Can you stop that, please?

51:01.440 --> 51:05.115
What is happening? Are you hurting Ayotunde?

51:06.560 --> 51:08.949
Are you all right? He hurt you hard?

51:09.000 --> 51:12.276
He hit you? Come here.
We do not hurt our friends.

51:12.320 --> 51:14.914
You come and sit over here.
Get on with your work.

51:17.160 --> 51:19.993
You were hurting Ayotunde for no reason.
That's not very nice.

51:20.040 --> 51:21.951
That's not what we do to our friends.

51:23.480 --> 51:27.268
- I can't do these.
- Yes, you can. You carry on with that.

51:27.320 --> 51:29.959
- Miss, I've got a tiger fish.
- OK, Chelsea.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.991
What's happening here, eh?

51:39.840 --> 51:42.070
You can talk to me, you know?

51:43.880 --> 51:45.996
<i>Anything you want to say.</i>

51:47.760 --> 51:50.149
I'm here to help you.

51:58.080 --> 51:59.672
Because I'm your mate, aren't I?

52:02.840 --> 52:04.876
- Yes.
- Yeah, that's right.

52:05.960 --> 52:07.871
That's what mates do...

52:09.040 --> 52:10.917
...isn't it?

52:10.960 --> 52:13.076
<i>- Yes.
- Yeah.</i>

52:18.800 --> 52:20.756
What's making you so angry?

52:25.840 --> 52:27.751
I want to help sort this out.

52:29.760 --> 52:31.671
Come on, chop chop.

52:34.040 --> 52:35.951
- Hi, Jenny.
- Hi, Poppy.

52:38.240 --> 52:39.719
- Poppy.
- Have you got a minute?

52:39.760 --> 52:41.671
- What's up?
- I think I might have a problem.

52:41.720 --> 52:43.790
- Come in. Sit yourself down.
- Cheers.

52:48.600 --> 52:50.511
It's Nick, really...
