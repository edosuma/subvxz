WEBVTT

02:48.085 --> 02:49.502
There you are.

02:50.254 --> 02:53.798
How was your day?
Any progress in saving the world?

02:54.091 --> 02:55.675
I'm working on it.

02:56.635 --> 02:59.679
Wow. So l guess
you changed your mind about tonight?

02:59.972 --> 03:02.723
Not realIy. Told you
I didn't want to miss it.

03:03.308 --> 03:05.309
What happened with that
dinner with the London people?

03:05.602 --> 03:08.187
-You made it sound so unavoidable.
-It was.

03:08.647 --> 03:10.314
Fortunately, they missed their plane.

03:13.777 --> 03:15.361
Here's to...

03:15.571 --> 03:17.405
...stoIen moments.

03:23.745 --> 03:27.248
You look so handsome,
I better go see if I can catch up.

03:50.105 --> 03:51.314
Nobody home?

03:51.481 --> 03:55.026
I left some Security Council
transcripts out, but everybody's gone.

03:55.819 --> 03:57.778
Anything earth-shattering?

03:58.113 --> 04:01.866
No, it's just important enough
not to be left out.

04:03.619 --> 04:05.244
You look incredible.

04:06.330 --> 04:08.122
Yeah, but we have to hurry.

04:24.181 --> 04:25.473
I prefer this one.

04:29.311 --> 04:30.478
Right.

04:58.423 --> 05:00.299
Can l have a picture, pIease?

05:00.509 --> 05:02.343
This way. This way, please.

05:03.762 --> 05:07.640
- This way, please.
- HoId it, one more.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.814
There's Andrew.
Good to see him. Hi, how are you?

05:15.107 --> 05:16.691
Steven, how are you?

05:16.984 --> 05:18.484
Nice to see you.
EmiIy, you look wonderfuI.

05:18.777 --> 05:20.069
Keep up the good work.

05:20.404 --> 05:23.406
That's Steven Taylor
and his wife, Emily.

05:24.282 --> 05:25.366
WelI, at last.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.326
The beautiful people have arrived.

05:27.577 --> 05:30.496
-Fantastic dress.
-Thank you.

05:31.289 --> 05:33.749
I didn't expect to see you
tonight, with Greenspan and aIl.

05:34.001 --> 05:37.044
-Why's that?
-I thought you'd be up to your ass in alligators.

05:37.295 --> 05:39.839
Rumors of my death have been
greatly exaggerated.

05:41.258 --> 05:43.342
AlI I need is her phone number.

05:43.593 --> 05:45.928
Absolutely.
I must go see about something.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.055
LoveIy. Thank you, darling.

05:48.890 --> 05:52.143
The temple's hieroglyphics
are supplications...

05:52.394 --> 05:55.855
-...to the gods of fertility.
-I do believe l know his work.

05:56.106 --> 06:01.694
Perhaps we could come along
to your studio one day. Have a Iook around.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.597
You said he wasn't coming.

06:29.848 --> 06:32.391
He changed his mind.
I tried to call you.

06:33.018 --> 06:34.727
What are we going to do?

06:36.063 --> 06:38.481
Nothing. Just relax.

06:39.316 --> 06:41.901
-He doesn't know who l am, right?
-No.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.362
You're a peach.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.074
Lunch tomorrow?

06:48.784 --> 06:50.367
And tomorrow...

06:50.577 --> 06:52.578
...and tomorrow. Heh, heh.

06:52.746 --> 06:56.499
I leave you alone for 30 seconds
and you elope with a younger man.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.710
Steven, I'd like to
introduce you to David Shaw.

06:59.878 --> 07:01.462
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

07:01.713 --> 07:02.797
David is a painter.

07:03.090 --> 07:06.425
I saw some of his pieces downtown.
I thought they were amazing.

07:06.718 --> 07:09.345
What brings you uptown to our
little inbred soirÃ©e?

07:09.846 --> 07:13.307
Actually, Emily was kind enough
to wrangIe me an invite.

07:13.558 --> 07:15.476
Me too. Heh, heh, heh.

07:17.062 --> 07:19.021
So teIl me about your work...

07:19.314 --> 07:20.356
...David?

07:20.649 --> 07:22.983
A couple small galleries
carry me when there's space.

07:23.276 --> 07:26.362
-You studied formaIly?
-Berkeley, Cal Arts.

07:26.613 --> 07:29.198
Almost formally graduated too.

07:29.449 --> 07:32.159
Heh. Too much study poIlutes the soul.

07:32.369 --> 07:34.495
-And he's good you say?
-He's wonderful.

07:34.746 --> 07:38.082
I'd Iove to see your pieces.
Maybe we can arrange a time.

07:38.333 --> 07:41.293
-Whenever you want.
-EmiIy has your number?

07:42.754 --> 07:46.006
No. The gallery can get ahold of me.
You know which one?

07:47.217 --> 07:48.592
Oh, yes. Yes.

07:49.427 --> 07:51.011
If you're as good as she says...

07:51.263 --> 07:55.599
...I'Il be glad to pass the word on
to my more acquisitive friends.

07:55.767 --> 07:57.184
Thanks. That's very generous.

07:57.769 --> 07:58.978
Nice to meet you.

07:59.604 --> 08:00.729
You too.

08:00.939 --> 08:02.523
Pleasure to see you.

08:17.372 --> 08:22.459
Average yield for
a one-year treasury bill rose to 5.28 last week.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.672
TRANSLATOR
We cannot be held accountable...

08:26.882 --> 08:30.217
...for the actions ofothers
that require us to defend ourselves.

08:34.890 --> 08:36.432
Madame Ambassador.

08:37.267 --> 08:41.395
This the same speech he gave in
Geneva three months ago, word for word.

08:47.152 --> 08:48.569
Showoff.

08:49.487 --> 08:51.947
- Ann, good morning, how are you?
- Fine, thank you.

08:52.240 --> 08:54.950
Steven, spreads are blowing out.

08:55.243 --> 08:58.495
The way things look in Europe,
it could turn into a bloodbath.

08:58.788 --> 09:02.541
So what are we talking?
- At least 1 50 basis points.

09:02.834 --> 09:04.335
The Bundesbank wiIl have to tag along.

09:04.586 --> 09:07.421
Your yen and mark positions
will get hammered.

09:07.964 --> 09:09.381
So, what's our exposure?

09:09.633 --> 09:11.467
Based on my preliminary trend model?

09:11.718 --> 09:13.093
Yes. No friIls.

09:13.345 --> 09:15.179
Think Chernobyl.

09:25.440 --> 09:28.442
Greenpoint, next stop. Greenpoint.

09:53.343 --> 09:54.468
What you got there?

09:54.719 --> 09:56.387
It's a little surprise.

09:56.888 --> 09:58.472
Come on up.

10:03.561 --> 10:05.145
Here's your fortune.

10:06.481 --> 10:10.734
"You have a deep interest
in all that is artistic."

10:11.653 --> 10:12.903
It's true.

10:15.532 --> 10:17.449
You didn't have to get this for me.

10:18.868 --> 10:22.788
-You need a little civilizing.
-Mm-hm.

10:24.624 --> 10:32.256
What do you need?

10:35.385 --> 10:36.427
Hm?

10:39.431 --> 10:42.474
You know, we couId be in Belize
this time tomorrow.

10:43.310 --> 10:44.685
Belize.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.979
You ever been there?
- No.

10:48.064 --> 10:52.693
-You'd think you'd died and went to heaven.
-But l already think that.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.457
You look so pretty today.

12:19.364 --> 12:22.950
Hey, it's David.
Leave one. I'll get back to you.

12:24.327 --> 12:27.830
David, hi. lt's Steven Taylor. I finish early today.

12:28.081 --> 12:31.041
I thought I might come by
and check out your work.

12:31.292 --> 12:33.293
Say about 6.

12:34.170 --> 12:39.091
If that flies with you, call me
at my office here at 5-4-4-...

12:39.342 --> 12:41.135
...1-8-1-7 .

12:42.637 --> 12:44.847
I look forward to seeing you.

12:47.851 --> 12:49.768
What are you going to do?

12:52.355 --> 12:54.481
I guess I'll caIl him.

12:55.692 --> 12:58.110
Be kind of weird if l didn't,
wouldn't it?

12:58.736 --> 13:01.155
You're playing with fire, David.

13:03.867 --> 13:07.202
If you're so upset about it,
why'd you give him my number?

13:08.329 --> 13:10.164
I didn't.

13:30.602 --> 13:32.019
Mr. Taylor.

13:32.896 --> 13:34.480
Hi. Here, sit down.

13:36.524 --> 13:38.775
That was stupid. Sorry about that.

13:42.405 --> 13:44.031
Thanks very much.

13:44.782 --> 13:45.782
Drink?

13:46.451 --> 13:48.076
No, I'm okay.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.245
Unless you want another one.

13:50.580 --> 13:53.165
I just had us meet here
because my place is hard to find.

13:53.458 --> 13:55.292
Like an illegal loft space?

13:56.794 --> 13:58.253
That's one way to put it.

13:59.172 --> 14:02.466
I feel like l'm knee-deep
in bohemian cachet.

14:02.759 --> 14:04.092
Lead on.

14:14.604 --> 14:17.397
-How's Emily?
-She's fine, thank you.

14:18.900 --> 14:20.901
WelI, be sure and say "hi."

14:21.152 --> 14:22.528
I wilI.

14:24.697 --> 14:27.282
One more.
One more floor.

14:27.575 --> 14:30.160
Building's over 1 00 years old now.

14:35.291 --> 14:36.875
Watch your step.

14:54.477 --> 14:57.563
I can certainly see
what Emily was drawn to.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.398
Yeah? What's that?

15:00.149 --> 15:01.817
Your work. lt's...

15:02.151 --> 15:04.111
...very trashy...

15:04.654 --> 15:05.696
...but potent.

15:05.989 --> 15:07.072
Trashy?

15:07.490 --> 15:08.991
Is that what she said?

15:14.038 --> 15:15.581
Your anger...

15:16.499 --> 15:17.958
...it's very controIled.

15:18.668 --> 15:20.294
You think I'm angry?

15:21.754 --> 15:23.714
The anger in your work.

15:24.340 --> 15:26.592
The color of despair.

15:27.719 --> 15:29.636
Wonder where that comes from.

15:30.847 --> 15:32.347
I don't know.

15:32.974 --> 15:34.600
Inside, l guess.

15:34.892 --> 15:35.934
Inside...

15:36.185 --> 15:37.352
...indeed.

15:40.690 --> 15:43.108
Nowhere to sit but the goddamned bed.

15:53.036 --> 15:54.995
You know, I envy you.

15:55.496 --> 15:56.788
You envy me?

15:57.040 --> 15:58.457
You should be...

15:58.750 --> 16:01.335
...flattered. l'm not prone to envy.

16:01.586 --> 16:04.421
It's a pathetic emotion.

16:05.840 --> 16:08.133
Sneaks up on you like cancer.

16:08.384 --> 16:10.052
I've got it and you know why.

16:12.722 --> 16:15.515
-No.
-Oh, of course you do.

16:16.726 --> 16:21.396
One of life's legitimately
sublime experiences. lt's so...

16:22.315 --> 16:25.108
-...utterIy complete.
-What?

16:26.110 --> 16:28.028
Fucking my wife.

16:31.074 --> 16:32.824
Mr. Taylor, l don't know--

16:33.076 --> 16:36.119
I think it's about time
you calIed me Steven.

16:39.749 --> 16:41.375
We're in love, sir.

16:43.211 --> 16:47.005
That's it?

16:47.924 --> 16:51.343
You steal the crown jewel
of a man's soul...

16:51.636 --> 16:55.889
...and your onIy excuse is some
candy-ass HalImark card sentiment?

16:56.182 --> 16:58.350
Even if it was true,
that's not good enough!

16:59.310 --> 17:00.769
If what were true?

17:01.020 --> 17:02.396
She is in love.

17:02.689 --> 17:03.689
You, buddy...

17:03.981 --> 17:05.272
...you're in business.

17:05.525 --> 17:06.733
What the hell are you saying?

17:06.983 --> 17:10.194
I'm saying you did not meet
my wife by chance.

17:11.114 --> 17:13.824
I'm saying
you didn't study at Berkeley.

17:16.786 --> 17:21.415
I'm saying you learned to paint whiIe
doing three to six in Soledad Prison...

17:21.665 --> 17:26.002
...for reIieving a widow
in San Francisco of her life savings.

17:26.295 --> 17:27.546
Your second conviction...

17:28.297 --> 17:30.257
...if l'm not mistaken.

17:32.677 --> 17:36.388
Your reaI name is Winston Lagrange,
which I rather like.

17:36.681 --> 17:39.766
Born to pure trailer trash
in Barstow, CaIifornia.

17:40.017 --> 17:42.018
Ward of the courts
since the age of 1 0.

17:42.270 --> 17:46.064
You went from pickpocket to car thief
to con man till you found out...

17:46.315 --> 17:49.151
...that you had a way
with the softer sex.

17:49.902 --> 17:53.113
No doubt looking for that mother
you can bareIy remember.

17:54.031 --> 17:58.618
A life made up compIetely
of depressing IittIe scams, untiI now.

17:58.870 --> 18:00.412
Where'd you get all that?

18:00.663 --> 18:03.749
AlI that is for sale.
The helI of it is, you're not...

18:04.041 --> 18:06.585
-...half-bad with a brush.
-Thank you.

18:06.961 --> 18:08.587
Called rehabilitation.

18:09.005 --> 18:11.423
It's calIed a con.
My wife's the grand prize.

18:11.716 --> 18:14.342
But you set your sights
just a IittIe too high this time.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.636
She loves me.

18:17.013 --> 18:18.764
She loves David Shaw,
your invention.

18:19.056 --> 18:22.768
Not that it matters, because you've made
a fundamentaI miscalculation.

18:23.060 --> 18:24.227
You play it out.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.104
Love conquers alI.

18:26.397 --> 18:29.107
EmiIy divorces me.
She marries you.

18:31.152 --> 18:35.447
Given your history, her advisors
are going to insist upon a prenup.

18:36.491 --> 18:38.116
So you might storm the castIe...

18:38.367 --> 18:41.369
...but you ain't getting the keys
to the treasure room, ever.

18:41.662 --> 18:42.996
I don't care about that.

18:43.289 --> 18:46.917
The swindler doesn't care about a
trust fund that can buy Barstow?

18:47.210 --> 18:48.835
Why don't you cut the shit!

18:49.086 --> 18:52.130
You care, or we wouId not be having
this conversation!

18:53.132 --> 18:57.469
The only thing that stops you from
bolting now is bad genes and greed.

19:01.390 --> 19:02.641
Now what?

19:03.518 --> 19:04.976
Choices.

19:05.686 --> 19:09.189
I can telI Emily exactly who you are,
and life wilI imitate art.

19:09.398 --> 19:11.316
You become a starving painter,
game over.

19:13.027 --> 19:14.152
Or?

19:15.154 --> 19:17.113
Or you can cash out.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.282
Cash out?

19:19.575 --> 19:21.076
Half a million dolIars.

19:21.869 --> 19:23.411
Tax-free.

19:27.124 --> 19:32.587
-Just for waIking away from her?
-I said tax-free. I didn't say free.

19:35.091 --> 19:37.008
What's 500 grand for?

19:38.719 --> 19:40.804
KiIling my wife.

19:42.431 --> 19:43.765
Heh.

19:49.438 --> 19:50.605
EmiIy?

19:51.065 --> 19:53.775
Imagine my embarrassment
if they're not one and the same.

19:54.026 --> 19:56.069
One hundred thousand now...

19:56.362 --> 19:59.322
...four hundred thousand after,
cash-and-carry.

20:06.247 --> 20:07.998
You're out of your mind.

20:08.749 --> 20:10.375
Not realIy.

20:11.961 --> 20:12.961
Why?

20:13.796 --> 20:18.466
I appreciate your curiosity,
but my agenda doesn't concern you.

20:18.968 --> 20:20.176
Oh.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.638
WelI, I guess I'll go straight to Emily
and telI her aIl this.

20:24.849 --> 20:28.143
That would be my word against yours...

20:28.436 --> 20:29.519
...Winston.

20:29.854 --> 20:31.771
And what if l call the cops?

20:34.901 --> 20:38.695
Have you ever been
to Boca Raton, Florida?

20:41.741 --> 20:45.869
There was a lady down there last year
who was carrying on with this younger man.

20:46.162 --> 20:50.040
He was a hell of a tennis pIayer.
Anyway, when the affair ended...

20:50.666 --> 20:52.042
...he disappeared...

20:52.335 --> 20:55.170
...along with the Iady's bearer bonds.

20:57.381 --> 20:58.965
You sure you've never been there?

21:00.384 --> 21:02.260
Not that I recaIl.

21:03.262 --> 21:07.682
An acquaintance of mine has
a photograph of the suspect.

21:09.143 --> 21:11.353
AlI they need is a name...

21:12.897 --> 21:14.981
...as in, strike three.

21:16.442 --> 21:17.692
Fifteen years.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.736
No parole.

21:21.572 --> 21:26.076
You think you got a box big enough
to hold $1 00,000 in cash?

21:28.621 --> 21:32.040
Come by the apartment
around 1 2:00 tomorrow.

21:32.792 --> 21:35.794
Unless you have
a previous luncheon engagement.

21:38.422 --> 21:40.882
I assume you know where l Iive.

22:35.855 --> 22:37.772
This is crazy. I'm your best friend.

22:37.940 --> 22:40.316
Half the year goes by
and you don't say one thing?

22:40.568 --> 22:42.861
-Do you love him? Will you Ieave Steven?
-Shh.

22:43.362 --> 22:44.487
Talk to me.

22:44.739 --> 22:46.781
I wilI if you shut up for one second.

22:47.324 --> 22:49.034
I'm waiting.

22:50.619 --> 22:52.871
I didn't telI you
because you adore Steven.

22:53.122 --> 22:55.081
You cried at our wedding,
for God's sake.

22:55.416 --> 22:58.209
-I cry at every wedding.
-No, you don't.

22:59.253 --> 23:01.379
You like the idea of us.

23:01.589 --> 23:03.339
Everybody does.

23:03.549 --> 23:06.051
But you have no idea who he is.

23:06.427 --> 23:08.553
-I know Steven.
-No, you don't.

23:09.680 --> 23:14.559
You don't know that everything
always has to be on his terms.

23:14.935 --> 23:18.855
Okay? You don't know that he has
no reaI interest in who I am.

23:25.071 --> 23:27.363
What are you going to do?

23:27.573 --> 23:29.074
I don't know.

23:29.617 --> 23:32.952
I'm going to figure out a way
to telI him. He deserves that.

23:33.245 --> 23:35.121
What makes you think he doesn't know?

23:35.414 --> 23:37.123
Because there's no way.

23:37.416 --> 23:41.169
I mean, he knows that
something's not right, but....

23:43.297 --> 23:45.423
Does David have a last name?

23:46.383 --> 23:48.134
Shaw. David Shaw.

23:48.761 --> 23:50.929
And he knows about your family?

23:51.222 --> 23:52.847
What do you mean?

23:53.933 --> 23:58.228
-What do you think I mean?
-Come on. We don't talk about that kind of stuff.

23:58.521 --> 24:01.689
-In six months, you never mentioned money?
-No.

24:01.982 --> 24:03.858
Believe me, okay?

24:04.151 --> 24:08.738
David has absolutely no interest
in anything other than painting...

24:09.698 --> 24:11.282
...and me.

24:11.575 --> 24:14.369
And you.
- Ha, ha, ha.

24:14.537 --> 24:16.579
Is that why you're not wearing
your wedding ring?

24:21.585 --> 24:23.002
Oh, my God.

24:24.130 --> 24:25.171
What?

24:25.840 --> 24:27.674
I left it at David's.

24:37.893 --> 24:39.352
Working late?

24:40.771 --> 24:42.647
No, I was having a drink with Raquel.

24:42.940 --> 24:46.359
And how is the CastiIian femme fatale?

24:49.071 --> 24:52.365
By the way, I saw your friend
David this evening.

24:52.908 --> 24:53.950
Really?

24:54.201 --> 24:57.453
He honored me with a visit
at his industrial hideaway.

24:57.621 --> 24:58.705
You're kidding.

24:59.373 --> 25:01.541
And where's that?

25:01.834 --> 25:03.585
Greenpoint, BrookIyn.

25:03.878 --> 25:05.420
How'd you get his number?

25:05.713 --> 25:09.340
I called some of those
obscure galleries you prowl...

25:09.633 --> 25:11.509
...dropped your name.

25:12.136 --> 25:15.263
You're right. He's very talented.

25:17.933 --> 25:19.309
Did you buy anything?

25:19.602 --> 25:21.394
I made him an offer.

25:27.610 --> 25:28.776
And?

25:29.904 --> 25:32.071
And he's chewing on it.

25:51.050 --> 25:53.301
Good morning.
- Morning.

26:10.361 --> 26:12.195
- Hello.
- Hi, it's me.

26:12.363 --> 26:13.696
Hey, how you doing?

26:14.073 --> 26:16.115
-I left my wedding ring.
-I know.

26:16.408 --> 26:18.409
I put it away before he got here.

26:18.702 --> 26:20.286
Thank God.

26:22.623 --> 26:24.207
What did you guys talk about?

26:26.210 --> 26:29.963
He wasn't here that Iong,
so just the work.

26:30.256 --> 26:31.631
He didn't have a clue.

26:33.008 --> 26:35.969
He said that he made you an offer.

26:36.303 --> 26:37.637
Matter of fact, he did.

26:37.930 --> 26:39.013
What piece?

26:39.265 --> 26:41.641
It's one you haven't seen.

26:42.434 --> 26:43.851
I thought l'd seen all of them.

26:44.144 --> 26:45.812
Well, almost.

26:46.730 --> 26:50.483
Listen, turns out I got to take
a rain check on lunch today.

26:50.776 --> 26:53.695
-Why? What's wrong?
-Nothing, nothing.

26:53.946 --> 26:56.572
Some people want to see my sketches...

26:56.865 --> 26:58.491
...and it'd be a good commission.

26:59.326 --> 27:00.618
You sound funny.

27:00.911 --> 27:02.120
Do I?

27:02.413 --> 27:03.538
Yeah.

27:04.248 --> 27:06.708
I guess it's calIed
being broke, sweetheart.

27:08.836 --> 27:10.336
Okay. Tomorrow, then.

27:11.005 --> 27:12.672
Reservation for two.

27:12.965 --> 27:14.966
Quiet table, in back.

27:15.259 --> 27:16.634
Very quiet.

27:19.138 --> 27:20.388
You know I love you.

27:20.806 --> 27:22.223
I know.

27:22.558 --> 27:23.641
-Bye.
-Bye.

28:10.314 --> 28:12.106
-Is that by...?
-Yeah.

28:13.650 --> 28:16.778
PeopIe with money
always go for the same things.

28:17.696 --> 28:19.447
And what are those?

28:20.449 --> 28:23.618
Anything, everything,
as long as it's recognizabIe.

28:24.453 --> 28:28.039
Don't worry. None of this
would've been yours anyway.

28:28.332 --> 28:31.376
Everything you see here, it's mine.

28:31.668 --> 28:34.379
Why don't you drop that
there and come here.

28:40.344 --> 28:41.761
That's nice.

28:46.850 --> 28:49.602
There was a robbery
in the building Iast year.

28:49.895 --> 28:51.979
Probable means of entrance...

28:52.272 --> 28:54.232
...was this driveway gate.

28:54.525 --> 28:58.319
That granite faÃ§ade creates a bIind
spot on the surveilIance cameras.

28:58.612 --> 29:00.530
It was never corrected,
for aesthetic reasons.

29:00.823 --> 29:02.031
How do you know that?

29:02.324 --> 29:04.033
I'm on the board.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.749
You enter as I leave at 8 p.m.

29:12.042 --> 29:15.128
I won't puIl out of the driveway
tilI it's clear.

29:15.379 --> 29:17.380
The gate takes five seconds to cIose.

29:17.589 --> 29:20.425
Hug the right side of the walI
as I drive by.

29:20.676 --> 29:24.053
Then you enter the stairs
by the service elevator.

29:24.304 --> 29:28.724
The key to the front door also works
here for the service entrance.

29:37.067 --> 29:40.069
I'm going to take the key from
EmiIy's purse before l leave...

29:40.320 --> 29:41.946
...and I'Il put it in this...

29:42.197 --> 29:45.408
...and hide it here,
right behind the pipe.

29:47.202 --> 29:50.204
-Where're you going to be?
-At my reguIar card game.

29:50.622 --> 29:51.956
Why don't you Ieave me your key?

29:52.249 --> 29:54.834
My key implicates me.
Her key impIicates no one.

29:55.085 --> 29:56.961
It could've been lost or stolen.

29:57.212 --> 30:00.256
In any case, she won't
be around to explain.

30:00.549 --> 30:02.008
Why not make a copy of the key?

30:02.301 --> 30:05.470
It's two loose ends,
the key and the locksmith.

30:07.097 --> 30:11.559
This door is always bolted. She
won't notice, even if she checks it.

30:11.852 --> 30:14.187
You'Il be in the stairwell at 9:30.

30:14.480 --> 30:17.482
By that time, Emily
will be taking her bath.

30:17.774 --> 30:19.317
She will? How do you know?

30:19.610 --> 30:23.112
Because that's what she does
on nights that I play cards.

30:24.156 --> 30:25.740
Why not do it in the tub?

30:26.783 --> 30:29.410
Because that'lI Iook like
cold-blooded murder.

30:29.661 --> 30:33.039
It has to appear that
she surprised the intruder.

30:33.290 --> 30:34.540
AlI right?

30:36.460 --> 30:38.461
This is a separate telephone line.

30:38.754 --> 30:42.340
Exactly 1 0 p.m., l will call here.

30:42.633 --> 30:44.967
EmiIy wilI answer the phone.

30:46.094 --> 30:47.970
You will enter...

30:48.680 --> 30:51.933
...and a tragic confrontation will ensue.

30:53.143 --> 30:54.894
It shouId appear to be...

30:55.187 --> 30:56.646
...stupid...

30:57.147 --> 30:59.106
...and spur-of-the-moment.

31:00.150 --> 31:04.654
I've always thought "bIudgeon"
has a spur-of-the-moment sound.

31:04.947 --> 31:06.280
Maybe you couId use one of these.

31:08.784 --> 31:11.452
Rifle the jeweIry in the bedroom.

31:11.745 --> 31:15.206
Disable the service entrance Iock.
Make it Iook like it was jimmied.

31:15.499 --> 31:19.126
Put the key back under the pipe,
then leave the way you came in.

31:20.295 --> 31:22.421
And what happens
if the pIan goes to hell?

31:23.799 --> 31:25.216
It won't.

31:43.235 --> 31:45.027
So when is this card game of yours?

31:45.279 --> 31:46.821
-Tomorrow night.
-Tomorrow?

31:47.197 --> 31:48.573
No fucking way.

31:48.865 --> 31:51.951
A man with your rÃ©sumÃ© shouId
come up with an aIibi in no time.

31:52.244 --> 31:54.078
One hundred thousand.

31:57.082 --> 31:58.916
A man with my rÃ©sumÃ© should
take the money and run.

31:59.209 --> 32:01.752
Bet you 400 thousand more you don't.

32:49.843 --> 32:53.137
Yes, I understand that.
But if we can't get numbers on refugee density...

32:53.430 --> 32:55.931
...then we can't position
the resources to deal with it.

32:56.433 --> 33:00.186
I'Il tell her to expect it
later today. Thank you.

33:07.194 --> 33:08.903
Bon appÃ©tit.

33:25.879 --> 33:28.130
That's not happiness to see me, is it?

33:29.174 --> 33:30.549
Try surprise.

33:30.842 --> 33:32.677
I had a hoIe in my scheduIe...

33:32.886 --> 33:36.472
...and I thought lunch with my
beautiful wife wouId be indicated.

33:37.349 --> 33:38.849
But l guess you have other plans.

33:39.101 --> 33:41.227
-What makes you say that?
-You seem in such a hurry.

33:41.520 --> 33:42.728
It's just errands.

33:43.021 --> 33:45.189
Like shopping for a new wedding ring.

33:45.482 --> 33:47.566
One of the settings felt loose...

33:47.859 --> 33:50.277
...so I took it in.
It'lI be ready tomorrow.

33:50.654 --> 33:52.571
And what if there were no tomorrow?

33:53.448 --> 33:54.782
What does that mean?

33:55.200 --> 33:58.536
Wouldn't you regret not having
one last lunch with your husband?

33:59.329 --> 34:00.746
Of course.

34:48.545 --> 34:51.422
I must reply to Francesca about
this weekend. Want to do it?

34:51.590 --> 34:53.716
-Sure.
-AlI right, we'll go out--

34:55.385 --> 34:58.554
I got to break this up.
Excuse me one minute.

35:00.015 --> 35:01.724
- Lane.
- Steven.

35:01.892 --> 35:03.851
- I know what he's up to.
- What?

35:04.019 --> 35:06.020
Watch out for this guy, all right?

35:19.785 --> 35:22.661
Before you finish
come back and talk to me, alI right?

35:22.829 --> 35:25.456
Yeah. Thanks a Iot. I appreciate it.

36:00.492 --> 36:04.078
Hey, it's David.
Leave one. I'll get back to you.

36:05.080 --> 36:07.331
David, are you there?

36:08.625 --> 36:10.501
He was waiting for me outside...

36:10.752 --> 36:13.879
...to take me to lunch. I had no idea.
There was nothing l could do.

36:17.717 --> 36:19.760
You know what, l just--

36:19.928 --> 36:22.596
I can't do this anymore.
I've got to tell him tonight.

36:24.349 --> 36:25.558
Hi, I'm here.

36:27.477 --> 36:28.644
I'm really sorry.

36:29.563 --> 36:30.563
It's okay.

36:30.814 --> 36:33.816
He's never done that before.
Something's wrong. He knows.

36:34.150 --> 36:35.568
No, he doesn't.

36:35.861 --> 36:37.695
Don't let your mind
get away from you.

36:39.656 --> 36:41.448
I cannot live like this anymore.

36:41.700 --> 36:44.743
It's not right. It's not fair to him.
I've got to tell him.

36:45.203 --> 36:47.121
Tell him what, exactly?

36:47.414 --> 36:50.249
-Tell him everything, tonight.
-Look...

36:51.626 --> 36:53.961
...we've waited this long.
Hold off another day...

36:54.337 --> 36:56.547
...so we can figure it out together.

36:56.965 --> 36:59.884
You know? So l can help you.

37:00.969 --> 37:03.470
-I don't know.
-I do.

37:04.890 --> 37:06.307
I do know.

37:07.517 --> 37:09.518
Honey, don't panic.

37:26.328 --> 37:28.412
Good night, Mr. Taylor.

37:28.705 --> 37:32.708
I'm on my way.
Everything's prepared for you.

37:34.294 --> 37:36.670
Give my best to Mrs. TayIor.

38:08.745 --> 38:10.996
So how was the rest of your day?

38:12.374 --> 38:14.124
Fairly brutaI.

38:15.377 --> 38:17.252
I'm sorry to hear about that.

38:20.757 --> 38:22.508
I don't want you to go tonight.

38:25.178 --> 38:26.428
What's wrong?

38:28.556 --> 38:30.557
I'd Iike to talk to you.

38:33.311 --> 38:34.812
It's too late.

38:35.772 --> 38:38.023
They'lI never get anybody to filI in.

38:39.234 --> 38:43.696
Besides, I beat them pretty bad last week.
They'lI all want their money back.

40:25.340 --> 40:27.007
You scared me.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.844
I just wanted to say goodbye.

40:42.023 --> 40:44.942
-I'Il calI you later.
-Okay.

40:45.401 --> 40:49.488
I might run down to Nick's for a burger.
If nobody's here, don't worry.

40:51.407 --> 40:54.618
I won't,
but you might want to reconsider.

40:54.869 --> 40:56.245
Why is that?

40:56.538 --> 40:58.872
I had Janice make
one of her Iegendary roasts.

40:59.457 --> 41:00.624
Really?

41:02.585 --> 41:04.211
Thought we'd eat before the game.

41:05.922 --> 41:07.214
Wish me luck.

41:08.216 --> 41:09.591
Good luck.

42:58.076 --> 42:59.576
Thousand dollars to you, George.

42:59.786 --> 43:00.911
Fold.

43:04.999 --> 43:06.625
- Call.
- Down and dirty.

43:06.876 --> 43:08.627
Last one, gentlemen.

43:10.755 --> 43:13.924
All right, I got a good feeling.
I got a good feeling.

43:15.343 --> 43:18.971
- Gotta have more than that.
- Three sixes still bets.

43:52.964 --> 43:56.466
Gentlemen, same game.
lt's getting boring.

44:06.185 --> 44:07.519
I'm out.

44:27.999 --> 44:30.042
Must be morning in Hong Kong.

44:52.023 --> 44:53.148
There's my cards.

44:53.775 --> 44:55.901
Let's have a better hand this time.

45:34.148 --> 45:35.524
You've got to be kidding me.

46:00.758 --> 46:02.008
Hello.

46:03.845 --> 46:05.762
- That's a serious bet.
Uh-huh.

46:06.013 --> 46:07.305
Hello?

46:09.934 --> 46:10.934
Hello.

46:13.771 --> 46:15.397
Who is this?

47:20.171 --> 47:22.255
Argh!

47:42.360 --> 47:44.027
- I'm in.
- All right.

47:44.195 --> 47:47.155
- Put your money up.
- Just in time.

47:47.406 --> 47:49.908
Different winner this time, though, guys.

47:50.493 --> 47:51.743
I liked the last one.

49:24.462 --> 49:26.087
Oh, my God.

49:29.300 --> 49:30.425
What happened?

49:30.718 --> 49:32.385
Mrs. Taylor, we have your location.

49:32.595 --> 49:34.220
He's in the kitchen.

49:34.472 --> 49:39.017
Please stay on the line.
Ma'am? Ma'am?

49:46.025 --> 49:47.275
Oh, Jesus.

51:06.522 --> 51:08.148
Police! Open up!

51:08.482 --> 51:09.983
Police! Open up!

51:16.866 --> 51:18.158
Open up!

51:19.869 --> 51:21.494
- Mr. Taylor?
- We're all right.

51:21.746 --> 51:24.497
He's in the kitchen.
I think he's dead. FolIow me.

51:38.012 --> 51:39.971
You didn't hear any...

51:40.598 --> 51:42.849
...strange sounds...

51:43.976 --> 51:46.686
...prior to your entering the kitchen?

51:47.938 --> 51:50.148
No, just the phone call.

51:50.441 --> 51:53.234
But before that, nothing unusual?

52:01.202 --> 52:04.329
- How you guys doing?
- We're pretty set here.

52:04.622 --> 52:06.915
I want you to dust the elevator cage...

52:07.458 --> 52:09.125
...and the banister.

52:09.376 --> 52:12.504
Mo, be out of here in 1 5, 20 minutes.

52:14.465 --> 52:15.590
Maybe.

52:23.057 --> 52:25.141
-Detective Karaman.
-Steven Taylor.

52:25.392 --> 52:27.602
Pleasure, sir.
Mind if l ask you a few questions?

52:27.895 --> 52:29.103
No. Not at all.

52:29.772 --> 52:31.981
I noticed what I assume
to be your footprints...

52:32.233 --> 52:34.484
...in the blood around the deceased.

52:35.277 --> 52:37.320
-Can l assume those are yours?
-Yes, you may.

52:37.571 --> 52:38.988
May I ask what you were doing?

52:40.491 --> 52:43.576
-Making sure he was dead.
-Oh.

52:43.744 --> 52:46.538
-Was he?
-Appeared to be, yes.

52:46.914 --> 52:47.914
Take his pulse?

52:48.874 --> 52:49.874
No.

52:51.418 --> 52:53.586
You see right there?

52:54.296 --> 52:56.172
Did you Iean over him for something?

52:56.423 --> 52:58.883
I tried to determine whether
he was breathing.

53:00.219 --> 53:02.762
-Was he?
-Not at that time.

53:03.013 --> 53:04.222
Let's take a look.

53:28.080 --> 53:29.414
Something wrong?

53:31.876 --> 53:34.794
Aside from a dead man
lying in my kitchen?

53:36.005 --> 53:37.839
For a moment,
I thought you knew the man.

53:38.257 --> 53:40.341
-I don't think so.
-Why's that?

53:41.677 --> 53:43.386
I never forget a face.

53:43.679 --> 53:45.722
-Anything else?
-Not this second.

53:46.515 --> 53:48.641
Your wife must come down
to give a statement.

53:48.934 --> 53:51.352
-When?
-As soon as she's ready.

53:51.812 --> 53:56.065
Mr. Taylor, are you aware of anyone
who might wish your wife harm?

53:56.525 --> 53:58.776
My wife has no enemies.

54:00.487 --> 54:02.030
Thanks, Detective.

54:13.125 --> 54:15.209
I know, baby, l know.

54:15.836 --> 54:18.713
It's okay.

54:19.715 --> 54:21.591
You're going to be all right.

54:30.184 --> 54:31.726
What do you think?

54:32.269 --> 54:33.645
I beIieve her.

54:33.938 --> 54:35.396
What about him?

54:39.068 --> 54:40.693
I couIdn't say.

54:45.532 --> 54:46.532
You know, Mo...

54:48.494 --> 54:50.954
...rich people are different
from you and me.

54:51.246 --> 54:52.330
How?

54:52.623 --> 54:55.416
They got a fuck of a Iot more money,
for one thing.

54:56.460 --> 54:58.211
Very good, Bobby.

55:51.432 --> 55:54.976
Hey, Mo, you going to turn it up,
or what?

55:55.144 --> 55:58.771
You're absolutely sure about that.
lt was not the wrong number.

55:58.939 --> 56:00.565
I like it like this.

56:01.442 --> 56:02.984
You had said before...

56:03.902 --> 56:06.320
...that they did not speak.

56:06.697 --> 56:07.739
They didn't.

56:08.032 --> 56:09.282
They Iistened.

56:09.616 --> 56:11.576
Background noise?
Did you hear any?

56:11.785 --> 56:14.037
There wasn't any.
She told you.

56:14.329 --> 56:16.914
Maybe you should let your wife
answer the questions.

56:17.166 --> 56:19.250
She's been through enough tonight.

56:20.669 --> 56:22.879
We're almost through, Mrs. Taylor.

56:23.172 --> 56:26.424
There's just a few more things
I'd Iike to ask.

56:26.717 --> 56:30.094
Remember what
time you got home, Mr. Taylor?

56:32.306 --> 56:36.309
30. Came from my regular
card game at the Drake Club.

56:40.898 --> 56:41.939
You'Il love this.

56:46.820 --> 56:50.281
WelI, we've ID'd the man
who broke into your home.

56:51.867 --> 56:53.826
-May I?
-Sure.

56:57.498 --> 56:59.123
This man is a career criminal.

56:59.416 --> 57:03.044
You couIdn't dream up a better
defense for justifiable homicide.

57:04.379 --> 57:08.174
Your wife's on three.
She says it's an emergency.

57:09.968 --> 57:11.636
Right.

57:44.002 --> 57:46.379
I'm gIad we cleared that up.

57:46.839 --> 57:50.758
I'm going to ask you
not to leave the city, Mrs. TayIor.

57:50.926 --> 57:52.009
But she is.

57:52.261 --> 57:55.388
We're going to her mother's house.
Roger has the telephone number.

57:55.681 --> 57:56.681
Whoa. Wait. HoId on.

57:56.974 --> 57:59.517
Why? She hasn't been charged.
Her statement's complete.

57:59.768 --> 58:02.103
So it's really just a matter
of courtesy.

58:02.354 --> 58:03.688
Courtesy on our part.

58:05.232 --> 58:08.359
If you think of anything else,
give me a ring.

58:10.696 --> 58:12.405
I don't know what eIse
there is to think of.

58:12.990 --> 58:14.615
Probably nothing.

59:13.634 --> 59:15.301
My baby.

59:23.352 --> 59:24.810
Sandra.

59:35.447 --> 59:37.531
I'm just down the haIl, baby.

01:00:18.073 --> 01:00:19.490
Here you go.

01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:25.496
By tomorrow, this wilI all seem
like a bad dream.

01:00:32.212 --> 01:00:34.672
And what if there were no tomorrow?

01:00:42.389 --> 01:00:44.432
You know better than that.

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:50.104
Sleep welI.

01:01:09.166 --> 01:01:10.875
Please teIl me.

01:01:11.376 --> 01:01:13.210
How could something like this happen?

01:01:13.462 --> 01:01:15.254
Sandra, I don't know.

01:01:15.547 --> 01:01:18.841
I've gone over it
a thousand times myself.

01:01:19.176 --> 01:01:21.135
The world's gone crazy.

01:01:51.625 --> 01:01:55.002
Roger's prepared a statement
the DA wants me to sign.

01:01:55.253 --> 01:01:57.838
So I'Il head back into the city...

01:01:58.256 --> 01:02:02.426
...and come back in the morning
to pick up Emily if she's all right.

01:02:04.429 --> 01:02:05.679
David?

01:02:06.348 --> 01:02:07.848
It's me.

01:02:09.601 --> 01:02:12.103
I just wanted to tell you l'm okay.

01:02:14.481 --> 01:02:18.234
I'm not in the city,
but I'll call as soon as I can.

01:02:20.404 --> 01:02:21.862
I love you.

01:02:28.078 --> 01:02:30.037
I don't want her to be rushed.

01:02:43.468 --> 01:02:44.635
Steven?

01:02:46.054 --> 01:02:47.680
No, of course not.

01:02:48.014 --> 01:02:49.807
I don't want her to be rushed either.

01:02:50.058 --> 01:02:52.226
I'm going to check on our patient.

01:03:21.715 --> 01:03:22.756
EmiIy.

01:03:23.216 --> 01:03:26.343
Sorry, David.
EmiIy's resting right now.

01:03:26.678 --> 01:03:29.972
But l think you and I have got
something to talk about.

01:04:03.006 --> 01:04:04.465
Who was he?

01:04:06.176 --> 01:04:08.636
Somebody l met at Berkeley.

01:04:09.721 --> 01:04:11.889
Can he be connected to you?

01:04:12.849 --> 01:04:14.475
Not anymore.

01:04:21.274 --> 01:04:23.901
You got any idea
who you're fucking with?

01:04:26.321 --> 01:04:27.404
Yeah.

01:04:28.156 --> 01:04:29.823
You hired me
to kill your wife...

01:04:30.075 --> 01:04:31.825
...because you couldn't
do the wet work yourself.

01:04:32.702 --> 01:04:34.453
WelI, neither could l.

01:04:38.208 --> 01:04:40.417
So how do you know
he didn't talk to someone?

01:04:41.545 --> 01:04:43.170
Ron was a good man.

01:04:43.463 --> 01:04:45.506
Not quite good enough.

01:04:52.514 --> 01:04:53.806
Okay.

01:04:54.975 --> 01:04:56.934
So what's plan B?

01:04:57.769 --> 01:05:01.021
It's a little coincidental
if there's another attempt on her Iife.

01:05:01.314 --> 01:05:03.065
Gee, you think?

01:05:05.777 --> 01:05:07.069
So we wait.

01:05:07.654 --> 01:05:09.154
For what?

01:05:11.032 --> 01:05:12.825
I'Il let you know.

01:05:16.162 --> 01:05:17.955
Hey, Steve?

01:05:21.918 --> 01:05:25.129
Do I keep fucking your wife
in the meantime, or what?

01:05:37.684 --> 01:05:39.226
Thank you, Charles.

01:05:44.399 --> 01:05:46.442
Steven calIed while you were asIeep.

01:05:46.735 --> 01:05:49.153
He's getting everything ready
for you to come home.

01:05:50.238 --> 01:05:52.990
He wants to send the car
for you tomorrow.

01:05:53.366 --> 01:05:55.200
I'm not going home.

01:05:56.453 --> 01:05:59.455
I'm going to move in with Raquel
for a while.

01:06:01.291 --> 01:06:03.250
Em, what's going on?

01:06:05.170 --> 01:06:07.171
I'm leaving Steven.

01:06:19.934 --> 01:06:21.852
Oh, Em.

01:06:40.664 --> 01:06:43.040
They've started liquidating
your long positions to cover.

01:06:44.668 --> 01:06:45.709
Which ones?

01:06:46.002 --> 01:06:47.544
DMG and Barclays.

01:06:47.962 --> 01:06:49.672
Why didn't anybody telI me?

01:06:49.964 --> 01:06:52.174
We tried, Steven.
We couldn't find you.

01:06:53.593 --> 01:06:55.594
I said no calls!

01:07:29.587 --> 01:07:30.671
- Albert.
- Hi.

01:07:31.464 --> 01:07:34.591
-May I please have our house key?
-Sure, Mrs. Taylor.

01:07:35.593 --> 01:07:36.635
What happened to yours?

01:07:37.011 --> 01:07:39.054
I've absoluteIy no idea.
It doesn't work.

01:07:40.223 --> 01:07:42.015
Did my husband change the locks?

01:07:43.476 --> 01:07:45.686
No, not that I know of.

01:08:59.344 --> 01:09:00.594
EmiIy.

01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:02.470
EmiIy, it's me.

01:09:03.055 --> 01:09:05.224
I didn't hear you come in.

01:09:05.475 --> 01:09:07.434
You left the front door wide open.

01:09:10.563 --> 01:09:12.272
-EmiIy.
-Don't.

01:09:14.234 --> 01:09:15.943
I'm your husband.

01:09:18.321 --> 01:09:20.906
Oh, God. I can't stay here.

01:09:21.198 --> 01:09:24.660
It's alI right.
We'll get out of here tonight, alI right?

01:09:25.745 --> 01:09:27.703
I can't stay with you, Steven.

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:30.040
I can't stay with you anymore.

01:09:30.416 --> 01:09:33.377
Raquel's waiting for me downstairs.

01:09:48.475 --> 01:09:50.727
Okay, there are fresh towels
in the bathroom...

01:09:50.979 --> 01:09:52.854
...and you can have anything
you want in the fridge...

01:09:53.106 --> 01:09:54.815
...including your favorite yogurt.

01:09:55.733 --> 01:09:57.609
Let me ask you a question.

01:09:58.862 --> 01:10:02.656
What do you think Steven would do
if he knew about David?

01:10:07.328 --> 01:10:12.124
WelI, EmiIy, screwing around is the
second oldest reason to kill somebody.

01:10:12.417 --> 01:10:14.751
Really?
And what would be the first?

01:10:15.879 --> 01:10:17.337
Money, honey.

01:10:22.886 --> 01:10:24.469
Oh, no, but Steven's rich...

01:10:24.679 --> 01:10:28.307
...and with your money,
you must've had a prenup, so....

01:10:31.936 --> 01:10:33.812
Tell me you had a prenup.

01:10:34.814 --> 01:10:36.690
He offered. l said no.

01:10:39.152 --> 01:10:41.862
So if you die, he gets, Iike...

01:10:42.113 --> 01:10:43.614
...a hundred million bucks?

01:10:44.365 --> 01:10:46.283
Something like that.

01:10:50.038 --> 01:10:51.580
Lucky guy.

01:10:52.457 --> 01:10:53.665
Yeah.

01:11:09.265 --> 01:11:12.434
I assume you have a very good reason
for asking me to do this.

01:11:12.602 --> 01:11:13.810
Yes.

01:11:15.021 --> 01:11:17.731
We'll sure miss you around here.

01:11:18.650 --> 01:11:19.691
Come.

01:11:20.902 --> 01:11:23.195
Come and see me on your way out.

01:11:23.613 --> 01:11:26.448
-EmiIy, this is Robert Harrington.
-How do you do?

01:11:26.741 --> 01:11:30.327
Bobby is the Deputy Director
of the Commodities Trade Commission.

01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:31.870
Please.

01:11:33.206 --> 01:11:35.999
- Take all the time you need.
- Thank you.

01:11:43.383 --> 01:11:44.883
Mrs. Taylor...

01:11:45.093 --> 01:11:48.011
...passing this kind of information,
even to a spouse...

01:11:48.262 --> 01:11:49.846
...is unethical.

01:11:50.098 --> 01:11:51.556
I understand.

01:11:53.893 --> 01:11:57.896
Your husband has been buying U.S.
and foreign bonds on margin...

01:11:58.106 --> 01:12:00.565
...and using those securities
as collateral.

01:12:01.567 --> 01:12:02.776
That's illegal.

01:12:02.986 --> 01:12:06.697
In fact, his company's been under
investigation for almost a year.

01:12:07.407 --> 01:12:08.532
Some months ago...

01:12:08.825 --> 01:12:11.284
...U.S. interest rates
started moving against him.

01:12:11.744 --> 01:12:14.538
He should've gotten some horrific
margin calls...

01:12:14.831 --> 01:12:17.624
...but the banks he's in bed with
have hidden the losses...

01:12:17.917 --> 01:12:20.252
...hoping that things
will turn around.

01:12:20.795 --> 01:12:22.421
It isn't happening.

01:12:23.089 --> 01:12:24.673
Sooner or later...

01:12:24.966 --> 01:12:27.384
...those margin caIls wiIl come.

01:12:27.802 --> 01:12:30.387
And when they do,
your husband wiIl be...

01:12:31.097 --> 01:12:32.347
...wiped out.

01:12:56.456 --> 01:12:58.248
Yep, where's the subpoena?

01:12:58.499 --> 01:13:00.792
But l can't get
the records without it.

01:13:01.836 --> 01:13:03.754
-I've waited two days.
-Mo.

01:13:06.632 --> 01:13:08.091
Just get back to me.

01:13:10.136 --> 01:13:13.263
-Detective.
-Please sit down.

01:13:16.059 --> 01:13:18.602
To what do l owe the pleasure,
Mrs. Taylor?

01:13:21.314 --> 01:13:23.815
I have some information
about my husband.

01:13:24.067 --> 01:13:25.150
Concerning?

01:13:25.401 --> 01:13:26.818
WelI....

01:13:27.153 --> 01:13:30.322
It seems he's in
serious financial trouble...

01:13:30.615 --> 01:13:33.033
...and he was hiding it from me.

01:13:33.534 --> 01:13:35.452
And l thought that...

01:13:36.329 --> 01:13:38.038
...might be a possible reason....

01:13:38.748 --> 01:13:40.082
A possibIe reason for him to--

01:13:40.374 --> 01:13:41.833
Hire someone to kill you?

01:13:43.211 --> 01:13:44.503
Yes.

01:13:47.882 --> 01:13:50.467
I know what you're worth,
Mrs. Taylor...

01:13:52.178 --> 01:13:54.054
...and that kind of money
is always a motive.

01:13:54.305 --> 01:13:56.598
Do you mean he's aIready a suspect?

01:13:56.891 --> 01:13:58.308
Was.

01:13:59.102 --> 01:14:02.521
Until we traced a phone calI he made
the night you were attacked.

01:14:02.730 --> 01:14:06.024
The trace led us to an automated
quote system at his office.

01:14:06.692 --> 01:14:10.821
It lasted from five minutes
before 1 0 to nine minutes after.

01:14:11.197 --> 01:14:13.573
That has to be one of the cleaner
alibis I've come across.

01:14:15.243 --> 01:14:17.494
I took your case apart
a thousand times...

01:14:17.787 --> 01:14:19.329
...then l put it back together again.

01:14:19.622 --> 01:14:22.124
There was always one piece Ieft...

01:14:22.416 --> 01:14:23.625
...like a screw that didn't fit.

01:14:24.085 --> 01:14:27.796
The dead man had a wallet,
cash and change, driver's license...

01:14:28.089 --> 01:14:30.632
...membership card
to a video store, but...

01:14:30.925 --> 01:14:32.676
...not a single key.

01:14:33.219 --> 01:14:34.678
Not one.

01:14:35.429 --> 01:14:37.764
Not even to his apartment.

01:14:41.394 --> 01:14:45.397
ElIiot, it's a zero-sum game.
You don't have the balls for it.

01:14:45.648 --> 01:14:49.151
By tomorrow,
neither of us will have any balls left.

01:14:49.402 --> 01:14:51.319
-Don't panic.
-You're damn right I am.

01:14:51.571 --> 01:14:53.780
So, what's it to you?
You drop 50 miIlion in a day.

01:14:54.031 --> 01:14:55.907
You know how fast 50 becomes 500?

01:14:57.451 --> 01:15:00.704
-Not now. What's the spot rate?
-We're sitting at ground zero.

01:15:00.955 --> 01:15:02.747
You're telling me,
"Think happy thoughts"?

01:15:03.082 --> 01:15:04.207
I said, not now!

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:07.961
I have a
caller who says this is an emergency.

01:15:08.212 --> 01:15:09.629
He says it concerns Emily.

01:15:12.258 --> 01:15:15.135
-Who is it?
-He won't identify himself.

01:15:19.599 --> 01:15:21.141
Who is this?

01:15:22.059 --> 01:15:25.353
A tragic confrontation will ensue.

01:15:26.147 --> 01:15:27.898
It should appear to be...

01:15:28.191 --> 01:15:29.649
...stupid and...

01:15:30.026 --> 01:15:31.860
...spur-of-the-moment.

01:15:32.153 --> 01:15:35.655
I've always thought that "bludgeon"
has a spur-of-the-moment sound.

01:15:35.948 --> 01:15:39.242
Maybe you could use one of these.

01:15:43.664 --> 01:15:46.750
Meet me at the diner at the corner
of Maiden and South.

01:15:47.210 --> 01:15:48.501
Right now.

01:15:55.718 --> 01:15:57.636
He was a con named RonaId Diggs.

01:15:57.929 --> 01:16:00.597
Fresh from state prison in CaIifornia.

01:16:21.452 --> 01:16:22.786
Must be hard for you.

01:16:56.737 --> 01:16:58.405
Mr. Taylor.

01:16:58.906 --> 01:17:02.367
You didn't get those fancy shoes
dirty walking over here, did you?

01:17:02.702 --> 01:17:04.035
What do you want?

01:17:04.328 --> 01:17:06.037
The rest of my money.

01:17:06.872 --> 01:17:10.208
You didn't fulfiIl your end
of the bargain, did you?

01:17:11.210 --> 01:17:12.252
So?

01:17:13.129 --> 01:17:14.671
So what do I get?

01:17:15.589 --> 01:17:17.799
You get this superfine thing.

01:17:18.092 --> 01:17:20.343
Hell, you might even calI it....

01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:21.928
What was that?

01:17:22.179 --> 01:17:23.722
"LegitimateIy sublime."

01:17:25.016 --> 01:17:28.059
What exactIy is this superfine thing?

01:17:28.436 --> 01:17:29.519
You're looking at it.

01:17:29.770 --> 01:17:32.522
It's calIed time outside of prison,
old partner.

01:17:32.815 --> 01:17:34.566
You can't beat it with a stick.

01:17:38.237 --> 01:17:42.907
Exactly how much time
does $400,000 buy me?

01:17:43.534 --> 01:17:44.868
Ah.

01:17:45.619 --> 01:17:47.787
Whatever the market will bear.

01:17:51.792 --> 01:17:53.168
It'lI take me a few days.

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:56.254
You got four hours.

01:17:56.756 --> 01:17:58.631
That's impossibIe and you know it.

01:18:00.343 --> 01:18:01.843
Come on, Steve.

01:18:02.136 --> 01:18:05.889
A man with your rÃ©sumÃ© shouId
come up with 400 grand in no time.

01:18:07.391 --> 01:18:08.725
Hm?

01:18:09.810 --> 01:18:10.852
Where?

01:18:11.145 --> 01:18:12.562
My place.

01:18:13.064 --> 01:18:15.273
You don't show up with the cash...

01:18:16.776 --> 01:18:19.235
...I'Il do a mailing of
Steven's greatest hits.

01:18:20.529 --> 01:18:23.740
-I understand.
-Yeah.

01:18:27.995 --> 01:18:30.288
Make fucking sure you do.

01:19:01.404 --> 01:19:02.946
What are you doing here?

01:19:23.008 --> 01:19:24.342
Manuel!

01:21:27.341 --> 01:21:31.511
-Sir.
-John, this is Mr. TayIor. He's from the....

01:21:32.263 --> 01:21:33.763
Yes, sir.

01:22:18.267 --> 01:22:20.768
That's not happiness to see me, is it?

01:22:23.689 --> 01:22:25.064
Try surprise.

01:22:29.570 --> 01:22:33.698
The key to the dead man's
apartment was on my key chain.

01:22:34.908 --> 01:22:36.826
Someone put it there
after I killed him.

01:22:37.077 --> 01:22:40.622
And there's only one person in the world
who could've done that.

01:22:41.624 --> 01:22:42.832
Me.

01:22:43.626 --> 01:22:44.876
Why?

01:22:45.336 --> 01:22:46.586
To protect you.

01:22:46.837 --> 01:22:48.212
From what?

01:22:50.674 --> 01:22:51.924
Your lover.

01:22:54.011 --> 01:22:57.430
Unless somebody eIse
sent these pictures.

01:23:17.618 --> 01:23:20.828
Amazing how you know people are in Iove,
even across the street.

01:23:21.497 --> 01:23:23.539
He called me here two months ago...

01:23:23.791 --> 01:23:26.542
...bragged about how
you'd fallen for him.

01:23:27.002 --> 01:23:29.337
I've shelled out over
$1 00,000 already...

01:23:29.630 --> 01:23:31.005
...but he wants a lot more.

01:23:31.298 --> 01:23:32.423
For what?

01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:35.009
For breaking it off.

01:23:37.012 --> 01:23:38.596
I don't beIieve you.

01:23:41.517 --> 01:23:43.059
Did he mention Belize?

01:23:46.271 --> 01:23:47.939
That's where he took
all the other ones.

01:23:49.775 --> 01:23:53.611
This guy was quite an aphrodisiac
for loneIy women of means.

01:23:54.488 --> 01:23:57.156
He learned to paint in prison...

01:23:57.366 --> 01:23:58.866
...not at Berkeley.

01:24:14.675 --> 01:24:16.426
I don't know where we go from here.

01:24:16.677 --> 01:24:19.762
I don't even know if "we"
is an option.

01:24:20.389 --> 01:24:24.976
I have done everything in my power
to protect you from this...

01:24:25.227 --> 01:24:28.896
...career criminal that you've let
crawl into our bed.

01:24:29.982 --> 01:24:31.566
Why didn't you tell me?

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:35.153
I was sure you were in love with him.

01:24:36.321 --> 01:24:37.697
Are you?

01:24:40.242 --> 01:24:42.452
I thought that I was.

01:24:45.372 --> 01:24:48.374
Oh, my God. I can only imagine
what l've put you through.

01:24:55.132 --> 01:24:56.841
Is this why your business
is in troubIe?

01:24:57.718 --> 01:24:58.926
Trouble?

01:24:59.678 --> 01:25:01.429
The banks, margin calls.

01:25:03.390 --> 01:25:06.768
How did you know...?
It hasn't helped, no.

01:25:08.061 --> 01:25:10.813
-But it's true, isn't it?
-Yes, it's true.

01:25:11.064 --> 01:25:13.065
But l can always make money.
That's the fun part.

01:25:13.317 --> 01:25:15.693
There's a goddamn sea of it out there.

01:25:16.028 --> 01:25:17.820
But there's only one of you.

01:25:19.573 --> 01:25:22.742
But why did you put his key
on my key chain?

01:25:25.788 --> 01:25:28.581
David threatened violence
from the very beginning.

01:25:28.916 --> 01:25:32.126
When l saw the body lying there in the kitchen,
I was sure it was him.

01:25:33.003 --> 01:25:36.339
No doors had been forced open,
so I assumed that he had your key.

01:25:36.632 --> 01:25:38.841
But when? I'd used it
to come home that evening.

01:25:40.761 --> 01:25:44.347
Are you sure you used your key?
If memory serves me...

01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:48.226
...the door was wide open.
I saw you walk in.

01:25:48.477 --> 01:25:49.602
Maybe.

01:25:50.103 --> 01:25:53.105
In which case, he could've
taken your key anytime...

01:25:53.315 --> 01:25:57.568
...even the day before.
Did you see him the day before?

01:25:58.111 --> 01:25:59.195
Yes.

01:25:59.488 --> 01:26:03.616
So I went through his pockets,
I found what I thought was your key.

01:26:03.826 --> 01:26:07.245
And l reacted. l grabbed a screwdriver,
jimmied the door.

01:26:07.496 --> 01:26:10.289
I put it in his pocket,
took what l thought was your key...

01:26:10.874 --> 01:26:13.125
...and put it on your key chain.

01:26:13.919 --> 01:26:18.589
Baby, I am so sorry
for having to put you through this.

01:26:19.174 --> 01:26:21.425
But it was the only thing l could do.

01:26:21.969 --> 01:26:23.719
Can you ever forgive me?

01:26:24.346 --> 01:26:26.514
Honey, I already have.

01:26:30.894 --> 01:26:32.937
Oh, Steven.

01:26:33.939 --> 01:26:36.232
We have to go to the police.

01:26:38.694 --> 01:26:42.154
I don't know if this is the time
for brutal honesty.

01:26:42.447 --> 01:26:44.115
I've tampered with evidence...

01:26:44.366 --> 01:26:45.741
...in a homicide.

01:26:45.993 --> 01:26:48.786
I paid off a blackmail.
I'm in over my head and so are you.

01:26:49.037 --> 01:26:53.124
Think it through.
David could say anything he wants.

01:26:53.375 --> 01:26:55.459
He couId say that
I hired him to kill you.

01:26:55.878 --> 01:26:58.796
Or that he bIackmailed us,
the happy, weaIthy couple.

01:26:59.047 --> 01:27:01.591
It'd appear we killed that poor
bastard, thinking it was David.

01:27:01.842 --> 01:27:03.801
It depends on how he plays it.

01:27:04.052 --> 01:27:05.595
What about the man that I killed?

01:27:07.306 --> 01:27:08.723
That has to do with David?

01:27:08.974 --> 01:27:10.433
WelI, it must.

01:27:10.851 --> 01:27:15.688
Do you have any idea how many
burgIaries there are each day in this city?

01:27:16.231 --> 01:27:17.815
I don't think so.

01:27:22.362 --> 01:27:23.946
What are we going to do now?

01:27:24.698 --> 01:27:28.826
We'll have to disentangle ourselves
from your artist friend.

01:27:30.495 --> 01:27:33.372
Is there anything in his loft that
could Iink David to us?

01:27:35.876 --> 01:27:37.376
My ring.

01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:39.378
You said it was being repaired.

01:27:40.714 --> 01:27:43.132
That was a lie.
I left it by the bed.

01:27:46.219 --> 01:27:47.303
Anything else?

01:27:48.221 --> 01:27:50.222
Isn't that enough?

01:28:14.873 --> 01:28:16.374

01:29:28.947 --> 01:29:30.239
I'm on my way.

Could you spare 400 grand?

01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:06.650
I don't see why not.

01:30:12.532 --> 01:30:14.575
Don't think l won't count it.

01:30:14.785 --> 01:30:16.160
NaturaIly.

01:30:18.914 --> 01:30:21.540
Think of that
as your commemorative copy.

01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:32.301
Nice doing business with you, Steve.

01:30:37.224 --> 01:30:38.474

01:33:52.335 --> 01:33:53.961

01:33:59.843 --> 01:34:02.344
How's that for wet work?

01:34:05.849 --> 01:34:07.641
You should thank me.

01:34:07.934 --> 01:34:10.853
Artists are aIways appreciated
more after they're dead.

01:34:19.904 --> 01:34:21.196
You lose.

01:34:22.157 --> 01:34:24.533
I'm sorry, you got to speak up.
I can't hear you.

01:34:25.744 --> 01:34:27.453
-You're dying.
-Argh!

01:34:34.544 --> 01:34:37.338
Steven's greatest hits.

01:35:04.407 --> 01:35:07.659
- Excuse me. I got an emergency here.
- What are you doing?

01:35:07.952 --> 01:35:10.454
This'Il make it easier.
- Be my guest.

01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:24.134
Has there been a deIivery today?

01:35:24.344 --> 01:35:28.389
Just one. It came by messenger,
Your wife took it up with the mail.

01:36:51.973 --> 01:36:53.182
I didn't know you were here.

01:36:53.641 --> 01:36:55.434
I was out on the terrace.

01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:11.033
Welcome home.

01:37:17.957 --> 01:37:20.459
It's time for a new start.

01:37:22.504 --> 01:37:26.173
What do you say we go out
for dinner this evening?

01:37:26.466 --> 01:37:29.593
Just the two of us, someplace quiet...

01:37:30.094 --> 01:37:31.762
...in the neighborhood.

01:37:32.263 --> 01:37:34.473
-Like that?
-Okay.

01:37:35.433 --> 01:37:37.976
I'Il be right back. l'm going to clean up.

01:39:17.952 --> 01:39:20.329
-Honey?
-Yeah?

01:39:20.538 --> 01:39:24.166
Let's stay home tonight.
I'Il go pick up something to eat.

01:39:26.878 --> 01:39:29.671
That's sweet of you. Yeah.
Just don't be too long.

01:39:30.256 --> 01:39:31.298
I won't.

01:39:31.507 --> 01:39:33.216
Okay.

01:39:33.885 --> 01:39:37.638
Before l forget, I think
we should have the locks changed.

01:39:46.272 --> 01:39:47.272
Why?

01:39:48.024 --> 01:39:50.442
Because I still can't find my key.

01:39:54.364 --> 01:39:57.866
Good idea. l'll call
the Iocksmith in the morning.

01:39:58.326 --> 01:40:00.369
Better be safe than sorry.

01:40:00.662 --> 01:40:01.912
Thanks.

01:40:03.498 --> 01:40:05.916
-See you soon. Hurry back.
-Okay.

01:40:42.912 --> 01:40:44.996
Must have put it back on his way in.

01:40:46.499 --> 01:40:48.583
Didn't plan on that, did you?

01:40:56.467 --> 01:40:57.884
Young David...

01:40:58.970 --> 01:41:00.595
...he was very unpredictable.

01:41:01.472 --> 01:41:03.432
Maybe you'Il share a celI.

01:41:04.892 --> 01:41:06.184
Why?

01:41:06.978 --> 01:41:08.437
Because of this?

01:41:10.857 --> 01:41:13.024
I just found the key you Iost.

01:41:13.359 --> 01:41:15.068
You left it for him.

01:41:16.195 --> 01:41:17.446
You mean the man you kilIed.

01:41:17.697 --> 01:41:19.948
-I never met the gentIeman.
-David did.

01:41:20.199 --> 01:41:22.617
They'lI have a hard time
proving l knew David.

01:41:22.910 --> 01:41:25.162
The blackmail proves it.

01:41:25.371 --> 01:41:26.455
What bIackmail?

01:41:27.081 --> 01:41:28.415
There's only one letter...

01:41:28.666 --> 01:41:30.667
...and I'm afraid that's vanished.

01:41:32.587 --> 01:41:35.172
The thing is, we're just
another married couple...

01:41:35.423 --> 01:41:37.424
...trying to work things out.

01:41:38.384 --> 01:41:42.095
Work it out?

01:41:43.973 --> 01:41:46.975
Because that's
what she does on nights l play cards.

01:41:47.268 --> 01:41:49.478
Like the combination to the safe?

01:41:49.771 --> 01:41:51.104
It's our wedding day, Steven.

01:41:52.690 --> 01:41:56.359
Work it out? You work it out
on your fucking own! This is over!

01:42:01.532 --> 01:42:03.784
I'Il tell you when it's over.

01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:27.224
The only way you leave me
is dead.

01:42:28.935 --> 01:42:30.811
Aah!

01:43:26.450 --> 01:43:27.993
I always thought...

01:43:28.202 --> 01:43:30.996
..."bludgeon" had a
spur-of-the-moment sound.

01:43:32.456 --> 01:43:35.083
Maybe you could use one of these.

01:43:37.545 --> 01:43:40.046
Rifle the jewelry in the bedroom.

01:43:40.339 --> 01:43:43.884
Disable the service entrance lock.
Make it look like it was jimmied.

01:43:44.385 --> 01:43:46.011
Put the key back under the pipe...

01:43:46.262 --> 01:43:48.346
...then leave
the same way you came in.

01:43:49.599 --> 01:43:52.267
And what happens if the plan goes to hell?

01:43:54.478 --> 01:43:55.937
It won't.

01:44:06.657 --> 01:44:08.450
He said he was going to kill me.

01:44:09.493 --> 01:44:11.369
So I tried to run.

01:44:12.413 --> 01:44:14.080
And then he attacked you?

01:44:17.043 --> 01:44:18.209
Yes.

01:44:21.339 --> 01:44:23.173
What eIse could you do?

01:44:33.684 --> 01:44:35.810
And you as well.
