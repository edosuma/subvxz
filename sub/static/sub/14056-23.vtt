WEBVTT

00:00.050 --> 00:01.340
Previously on The O.C.:

00:01.341 --> 00:03.065
So how was Berkeley? Was it amazing?

00:03.066 --> 00:04.601
Could be, if I was ready for it.

00:04.602 --> 00:06.673
- I'm not looking after her anymore--
- Treat her right.

00:06.674 --> 00:09.184
I saw Theresa at the airport. She had a baby with her.

00:09.185 --> 00:10.605
Say hi, Daniel.

00:10.606 --> 00:11.513
Hi, Daniel.

00:11.514 --> 00:13.582
He's not yours, Ryan. Eddie's the father.

00:13.583 --> 00:15.293
Want to grab a bite? You can tell me about him.

00:15.294 --> 00:16.763
Yeah, I'd like that.

00:17.012 --> 00:19.892
To Sandy Cohen, who has told me countless times

00:19.891 --> 00:22.646
how important this hospital is to him.

00:22.643 --> 00:23.369
Ouch.

00:23.362 --> 00:25.461
They say that when you grow up, you marry your father.

00:25.462 --> 00:26.799
I thought I'd escaped that.

00:26.800 --> 00:28.811
All my sins, very detailed.

00:28.812 --> 00:31.242
If I ever screw up again, you give that to my parents.

00:31.243 --> 00:32.641
- Cohen?
- Anna?

00:32.642 --> 00:36.072
So, you are going to Brown. You just didn't want to come with me.

00:36.073 --> 00:37.960
You're probably really confused right about now.

00:37.961 --> 00:41.001
No, everything you've done up until now finally makes sense.

00:41.002 --> 00:42.367
Rhode Island School of Design?

00:42.378 --> 00:43.877
You'll be in the same state as Summer.

00:43.878 --> 00:46.533
Seth is going to Brown, and he's dating Anna?

00:50.751 --> 00:52.644
It's senior prom; it's mythic.

00:52.645 --> 00:56.072
Yeah, well, it's ties and dresses and photos with parents.

00:56.073 --> 00:57.266
Sounds like any other dance to me.

00:57.267 --> 01:00.246
Well, it's not. It's a romantic capstone to your entire adolescence,

01:00.247 --> 01:03.429
and if Summer and I don't go together, it's over.

01:03.430 --> 01:04.625
Well, ask her.

01:04.686 --> 01:07.283
Oh, she's still not talking to me.

01:07.369 --> 01:09.950
Well, have you told her there's nothing going on between you and Anna?

01:09.951 --> 01:13.346
I tried, but every time we get close, she blows her rape whistle.

01:14.413 --> 01:15.319
Rape.

01:15.320 --> 01:17.423
Well, you know, I'm not going, so, if you, uh...

01:17.424 --> 01:18.851
if you want to hang out, rent a movie...

01:18.852 --> 01:22.078
Ryan, I love you, but if I have to spend my senior prom

01:22.079 --> 01:24.208
playing video games with you, I'm going to kill myself.

01:24.209 --> 01:27.750
Besides, I left Summer a message telling her I'm going to meet her at the diner tomorrow morning.

01:27.751 --> 01:28.772
You think she'll show?

01:28.773 --> 01:31.268
Kind of pretended I was the Brown admissions guy.

01:31.269 --> 01:33.092
It's senior prom; anything goes. Hi, there.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.010
Hi. What's it going to be?

01:34.011 --> 01:36.031
- Chicken, please.
- And I'll have the beef.

01:36.032 --> 01:37.622
Why aren't you going to ask someone, man?

01:37.623 --> 01:40.646
What about Tina Woo-- she's been looking really hot lately.

01:40.704 --> 01:41.867
What about Theresa?

01:41.868 --> 01:42.927
Uh, yeah, I don't think so.

01:42.928 --> 01:44.710
Why? You said you've been spending a lot of time with her.

01:44.711 --> 01:46.910
We have. Actually, she's coming over to the house tomorrow.

01:46.911 --> 01:49.890
Okay, great-- now that the baby thing's resolved, the pressure's off.

01:49.891 --> 01:50.909
It's perfect. Do it.

01:50.910 --> 01:52.624
But, I mean, she still has the baby. She can't just, you know...

01:52.625 --> 01:55.928
One night. They have these new crazy things called baby-sitters.

01:55.929 --> 01:58.569
I'm just saying, it's senior prom.

01:58.570 --> 02:02.246
She's your childhood sweetheart. You have to respect the romantic symmetry.

02:03.538 --> 02:04.662
You know what? I'll think about it,

02:04.663 --> 02:07.847
and I appreciate you not bringing up the idea of Marissa and I going as friends.

02:07.848 --> 02:10.003
No, I get it. It's in the past.

02:10.005 --> 02:12.485
Plus, I assume she'll be going with the surf nazi anyways,

02:12.486 --> 02:15.457
unless he's selling crack to blind kids, or--

02:18.608 --> 02:21.297
Or fondling some girl at the end of the pier.

02:25.825 --> 02:27.747
Ah, maybe that's his cousin.

02:29.913 --> 02:33.399
His really... dirty cousin.

02:35.000 --> 02:41.074

03:27.300 --> 03:28.975
- Hi. Leave.
- Okay, Summer...

03:28.976 --> 03:31.008
No, I'm meeting someone here. You need to leave.

03:31.009 --> 03:32.270
The Brown guy?

03:32.271 --> 03:33.908
How did you know that?

03:34.175 --> 03:37.197
I'm sorry. It was just the only way I could get you to meet me.

03:37.198 --> 03:39.439
You are sick, you know that? Deranged.

03:39.440 --> 03:40.204
- No.
- Yes.

03:40.265 --> 03:41.471
- No.
- Yes.

03:41.472 --> 03:43.121
No, our first kiss was on Halloween.

03:43.122 --> 03:44.678
Trust me, it was my sixth birthday,

03:44.679 --> 03:48.151
and my mom let me have dancing, but you didn't know how, so you hid in the bathroom.

03:48.152 --> 03:50.873
And you tracked me down and kissed me. How did I ever block that out?

03:50.874 --> 03:52.188
I don't know.

03:57.335 --> 03:59.995
This is crazy. Do you want to go to prom with me?

04:01.201 --> 04:02.234
What?

04:03.135 --> 04:04.336
Okay...

04:04.661 --> 04:06.762
Wait, that's not why I'm here.

04:07.766 --> 04:12.584
So, you're going to think I'm... really lame, but...

04:13.852 --> 04:16.983
would you maybe want to go to prom with me?

04:18.072 --> 04:19.209
Are you serious?

04:19.211 --> 04:22.677
Just give me two minutes. I ordered pancakes for you-- chocolate chip.

04:28.522 --> 04:30.278
Fine, two minutes, but that is it.

04:30.279 --> 04:31.543
Okay.

04:34.139 --> 04:37.922
Hey,  somebody wrote "prom" on my pancake. That is so weird.

04:37.923 --> 04:39.626
- Weird!
- Oh, my God.

04:39.627 --> 04:43.833
Yeah, it's tomorrow night, so it's kind of late notice, but, um...

04:44.124 --> 04:46.252
Or not, or not. You know what? It's-it's probably a bad idea.

04:46.253 --> 04:49.886
No, Ryan, it's just that... there's this guy that I work with,

04:49.887 --> 04:53.654
and we're not really dating or anything, but we've become close.

04:53.655 --> 04:56.831
Yeah, no, I understand. Uh, I should probably get ready for school.

04:56.832 --> 05:00.090
So, what, you just... hate prom?

05:00.091 --> 05:01.705
Pretty much.

05:01.993 --> 05:05.042
Why? Did you have a bad prom experience?

05:05.043 --> 05:07.566
'Cause, hey, you know, I've heard there's support groups for things like that,

05:07.567 --> 05:09.189
and really, I think you could recover.

05:09.190 --> 05:11.111
I haven't spoken to you in four days.

05:11.112 --> 05:13.226
You think pancakes and chocolate chips are going to make me forget

05:13.227 --> 05:15.105
that you and Anna went behind my back?

05:15.106 --> 05:15.893
We did not...

05:15.894 --> 05:20.367
Or that I saw you guys at the airport, and your long, tearful good-bye?

05:24.003 --> 05:24.999
You know...

05:25.000 --> 05:26.322
What?

05:26.811 --> 05:30.581
Did I ever tell you how much my mom loves baby-sitting?

05:31.090 --> 05:34.577
I, uh... I never actually made it to prom.

05:36.010 --> 05:37.585
I, um...

05:41.889 --> 05:44.561
I didn't get that close to graduation.

05:45.362 --> 05:47.969
Well, all the more reason to go now...

05:47.970 --> 05:50.637
'cause you'll have me there to protect you.

05:51.096 --> 05:52.304
Okay?

05:52.709 --> 05:54.036
All right.

05:54.627 --> 05:57.081
Not only will I not go to prom with you,

05:57.082 --> 05:59.549
but if you and I were stranded on a deserted island,

05:59.560 --> 06:01.957
I would take the nourishment that your meager frame has to offer,

06:01.958 --> 06:04.694
and then I would feed your bones to the sharks.

06:12.005 --> 06:15.035
- So, did she like the pancake?
- Yeah, she loved it,

06:15.036 --> 06:17.408
and then she said if we were stranded on a deserted island,

06:17.409 --> 06:19.362
she'd feed my bones to the sharks.

06:19.363 --> 06:20.662
I  think it's hopeless.

06:20.663 --> 06:23.547
Oh. Wait, she doesn't really think that we...

06:23.548 --> 06:25.372
She saw us hugging in the airport.

06:25.373 --> 06:28.351
Oh, my God, this is all my fault.

06:28.352 --> 06:29.777
No, it's not your fault.

06:29.778 --> 06:33.304
Yes, it is. If I hadn't been there, then you would have made up

06:33.305 --> 06:35.973
and you would be going to prom right now.

06:36.889 --> 06:38.130
You have to tell her the truth.

06:38.131 --> 06:40.417
- Yeah, I tried, but...
- No, no, no, not about us.

06:40.418 --> 06:43.441
You have to tell her that you lied about getting into Brown.

06:43.442 --> 06:45.177
I don't think I can do that.

06:45.178 --> 06:48.572
But you have to, Seth. You have no other choice. You've done everything else.

06:48.573 --> 06:50.517
Yeah, I know, but last time I lied,

06:50.518 --> 06:53.598
I had to write out this big confession of everything I'd ever done wrong,

06:53.599 --> 06:54.951
and my whole drug phase and that...

06:54.952 --> 06:56.064
You-you had a drug phase?

06:56.065 --> 06:59.056
I smoked a couple of joints, but I promised I'd never lie again.

06:59.057 --> 07:00.560
I don't think she's going to forgive me.

07:00.561 --> 07:03.795
Seth, she wants to feed your bones to sharks.

07:03.796 --> 07:05.564
You have nothing to lose.

07:05.565 --> 07:08.432
Listen, Anna, I appreciate your help, but, uh...

07:08.433 --> 07:10.930
I don't know. It's over. I give up.

07:13.382 --> 07:14.842
Anyways...

07:15.661 --> 07:17.616
I'm going to talk to you later.

07:18.473 --> 07:20.039
Man...

07:32.372 --> 07:33.867
You off?

07:34.256 --> 07:37.980
Uh, I should be home in time for dinner. Hey, isn't this prom weekend?

07:37.981 --> 07:40.913
Weren't you and Julie talking about having everybody over here for pictures?

07:40.914 --> 07:42.377
We did...

07:42.378 --> 07:46.127
but Ryan doesn't have a date, and Seth and Summer seem to be in some kind of fight.

07:46.128 --> 07:50.246
Oh, that's too bad. It's senior prom. It's a milestone.

07:50.663 --> 07:53.068
Maybe we should try and convince them to go anyway.

07:53.069 --> 07:54.554
Okay.

07:56.057 --> 07:58.211
When are we going to talk about us?

07:58.816 --> 08:02.637
In public again, or were you thinking about something a little more private this time?

08:02.638 --> 08:04.625
I'm sorry I attacked you,

08:04.626 --> 08:06.296
but at least I got you to listen.

08:06.297 --> 08:08.978
Well, I'm sorry I made it so difficult for you.

08:08.979 --> 08:10.436
So what do we do?

08:10.437 --> 08:13.817
Well, we should give the boys the weekend. They're going to be gone in a few months.

08:13.818 --> 08:18.994
And then... you and I can figure out how best to proceed.

08:21.022 --> 08:22.628
I, uh... I'm going to go.

08:22.629 --> 08:24.721
Sandy, there's something else.

08:25.956 --> 08:28.516
At the end of that dinner, I...

08:32.884 --> 08:34.722
I just wish I'd apologized then.

08:34.724 --> 08:36.631
Oh, that's okay.

08:37.852 --> 08:39.583
We'll be fine.

08:52.659 --> 08:54.008
Oh, Summer.

08:54.009 --> 08:56.280
- Hey, Taylor.
- Summer, wait.

08:56.281 --> 08:57.881
I have a big surprise for you.

08:57.882 --> 09:00.556
But first, business. Here are yours and Marissa's prom tickets,

09:00.557 --> 09:02.697
and I need $50 from each of you for the after-party.

09:02.698 --> 09:05.344
I rented out the Bait Shop. It is going to be such a rager.

09:05.345 --> 09:07.243
You know what? I don't think I'm going to go.

09:07.244 --> 09:09.308
You were prom queen last year. You have to go.

09:09.309 --> 09:11.725
Yeah, well, the queen is dead.

09:11.753 --> 09:12.902
I see.

09:12.903 --> 09:16.111
Well, perhaps you would like to hear who your date is.

09:16.112 --> 09:17.232
What are you talking about?

09:17.233 --> 09:18.657
- I got you a date.
- Taylor!

09:18.658 --> 09:21.328
Quiet. You know how I'm going with Sung Ho?

09:21.329 --> 09:22.813
The guy from the Korean barbecue?

09:22.814 --> 09:26.179
Oh,  yeah, we, like, totally found each other at the sweatshirt party.

09:26.180 --> 09:29.111
He's got this wonderfully hairless body.

09:29.112 --> 09:31.416
It's like hooking up with a seal.

09:31.720 --> 09:33.008
I have to go.

09:33.009 --> 09:36.094
So, it turns out his cousin Young Nam is visiting from Seoul.

09:36.095 --> 09:38.656
And his English is a little...

09:38.671 --> 09:41.989
but Sung Ho says he is huge on the K-pop scene.

09:41.990 --> 09:45.317
- What the hell is K-pop?
- Korean pop-- K-pop.

09:45.430 --> 09:48.558
Anyway, his band's called Big Korea, and he's a model, too.

09:48.559 --> 09:50.953
They actually based a couple of anime characters on him.

09:50.954 --> 09:55.282
Taylor, I'm not going to go to prom with some Asian pop singer that barely speaks English.

09:55.283 --> 09:56.631
- Summer.
- Ow.

09:56.632 --> 09:57.950
Cohen deceived you.

09:57.951 --> 10:01.735
It is your duty as a woman to make him feel pathetic and small

10:01.736 --> 10:04.962
by going to prom with the hottest guy you can find.

10:07.587 --> 10:09.203
That's a good point.

10:10.171 --> 10:11.228
Are you sure he's hot?

10:11.229 --> 10:16.707
Sung Ho said at his last concert, a gang of crazed school girls torched a cop car.

10:18.466 --> 10:20.541
Big Korea.

10:37.193 --> 10:39.250
Hey. How you doing?

10:39.251 --> 10:41.064
Hey. Good.

10:41.344 --> 10:42.967
Are those prom tickets?

10:42.968 --> 10:44.993
Yeah. I asked someone.

10:46.037 --> 10:48.035
Theresa, actually.

10:48.720 --> 10:50.758
Oh, well, that's great.

10:50.759 --> 10:51.551
Yeah.

10:51.552 --> 10:54.522
- So, the baby...?
- Really cute, but not mine.

10:56.071 --> 10:57.963
Well, what about you? Are you... are you going?

10:57.964 --> 11:00.361
I can't remember whether you and Volchok are still together or...

11:00.362 --> 11:02.233
Yeah, on both counts.

11:02.234 --> 11:02.992
Yeah?

11:02.993 --> 11:06.687
He wasn't exactly enthusiastic, but he said yes.

11:06.688 --> 11:08.596
Oh,  that's-that's, uh... that's great.

11:08.597 --> 11:09.656
Yeah.

11:09.657 --> 11:11.490
Okay, I should be getting to class.

11:11.491 --> 11:14.268
Um, congratulations on the Theresa thing.

11:14.756 --> 11:16.322
- See you.
- See you.

11:18.884 --> 11:21.007
Hey, it's Summer. Leave a message.

11:21.008 --> 11:22.416
Summer, hey.

11:22.417 --> 11:26.164
I just, I just want to apologize for what happened in the girls' bathroom today.

11:26.165 --> 11:30.213
I didn't mean to follow you in, or spook Mrs. Rushfield.

11:30.214 --> 11:36.402
I'm just trying to explain the idea of a romance between me and Anna so insane that...

11:36.525 --> 11:38.176
Hello, Seth.

11:38.177 --> 11:39.806
I got to go.

11:43.127 --> 11:45.741
Yeah, yeah. All right, all right, all right.

11:48.339 --> 11:50.121
Well, well, look who's here.

11:50.122 --> 11:51.508
I want to talk to you.

11:51.509 --> 11:54.388
Hmm. Yeah, I'm not really in the mood to talk, but try me later.

11:54.389 --> 11:55.545
Ken, listen.

11:55.546 --> 11:57.029
I saw you on the pier last night.

11:57.030 --> 11:59.510
Huh. Last night, last night...

11:59.590 --> 12:01.490
Yeah, I don't, I don't remember that far back.

12:01.491 --> 12:03.175
Maybe you remember the girl you were with?

12:03.176 --> 12:06.055
Long hair, tattoos, not much like Marissa?

12:06.056 --> 12:08.105
You know, you are something else, man.

12:08.106 --> 12:11.000
But tell me this-- why would I cheat on Marissa?

12:11.011 --> 12:15.082
I mean... that girl's hot, right?

12:15.083 --> 12:16.788
In every way.

12:17.932 --> 12:19.907
But then you already knew that, didn't you?

12:19.908 --> 12:22.230
You want to see how far you can push me, keep at it.

12:23.548 --> 12:27.076
I already fell for that Lethal Weapon psycho bit once.

12:27.077 --> 12:28.309
It's not happening again.

12:28.310 --> 12:33.301
Hey, Kevin. I think there's like a snake in the shower...

12:34.864 --> 12:36.303
What are you doing here?

12:36.304 --> 12:39.205
Yeah, Ryan. What are you doing here?

12:40.018 --> 12:41.520
Uh...

12:45.065 --> 12:49.070
Uh, Kirsten called. She's having people over for photos tomorrow,

12:49.071 --> 12:50.621
and I just thought I'd invite you.

12:50.622 --> 12:52.399
Oh, that's really sweet.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.682
Yeah, so sweet.

12:54.983 --> 12:57.542
Okay, ignore him. We'll be there.

12:57.543 --> 12:58.947
Yeah.

13:04.053 --> 13:05.377
Hello?

13:05.588 --> 13:06.781
Hey.

13:06.782 --> 13:10.130
Hi. Anna. Seth said you were in town.

13:10.361 --> 13:11.670
Hey, how are you?

13:11.671 --> 13:14.193
I'm good, and you look much more grown up.

13:14.194 --> 13:16.254
Yeah,  well, don't we all? You staying with your parents?

13:16.255 --> 13:17.421
My aunt and my uncle.

13:17.422 --> 13:20.624
Last year, my parents switched houses. We're a quirky family.

13:20.625 --> 13:21.202
Yeah.

13:21.203 --> 13:22.156
Are you going to prom?

13:22.157 --> 13:23.951
Yeah, actually. I'm going with Theresa.

13:23.952 --> 13:27.198
Hey, there she is. Look at a true friend, Ryan.

13:27.199 --> 13:29.869
- 2,000 miles she flies.
- In a middle seat.

13:29.870 --> 13:32.124
All to make sure Summer and I go to the prom together.

13:32.125 --> 13:33.945
Now, tell me, would you do so much?

13:33.946 --> 13:35.030
Let's not test it.

13:35.031 --> 13:36.922
Well, guilt could be a powerful motivator.

13:36.923 --> 13:39.763
I'd tell you again that it's not your fault, except I want to hear this plan.

13:39.764 --> 13:41.093
In phase one...

13:41.094 --> 13:43.750
Uh! Hear that, Ryan? Phase one.

13:43.751 --> 13:45.943
That suggests multiple phases.

13:45.944 --> 13:49.130
In phase one, I am going to go over to Summer's right now,

13:49.131 --> 13:52.017
and tell her that there is nothing going on between us.

13:53.755 --> 13:54.977
Okay.

13:54.978 --> 13:58.281
Out of curiosity, what you got for phase two?

13:58.282 --> 14:00.665
In the off-chance that phase one fails,

14:00.666 --> 14:03.154
phase two-- you take me to prom.

14:03.155 --> 14:04.247
I brought a dress.

14:04.248 --> 14:06.022
Yeah, I better get going.

14:06.023 --> 14:07.343
I'll call you.

14:07.344 --> 14:08.400
- See you later.
- Bye-bye.

14:08.401 --> 14:09.709
Bye.

14:21.767 --> 14:24.115
I don't know, I kind of like it.

14:24.116 --> 14:25.897
I'm going to kill Taylor.

14:25.898 --> 14:28.078
Why? Come on. He's cute.

14:28.079 --> 14:30.014
How can you tell? He's in a space suit.

14:30.015 --> 14:32.079
So do you think Kevin will like this?

14:32.406 --> 14:34.517
Yeah, if it rips off easy.

14:34.727 --> 14:37.224
This was supposed to make Seth jealous.

14:47.695 --> 14:49.996
- What's that?
- Just Seth's napkin confession,

14:49.997 --> 14:51.807
detailing all his lies and deceptions,

14:51.808 --> 14:54.053
including his pathetic two-week stoner phase.

14:54.054 --> 14:57.462
You know what? I think it is time for Sandy and Kirsten to know their son a little better.

14:57.463 --> 14:59.081
What? Summer, you can't do that.

14:59.082 --> 15:00.623
Oh, I can.

15:00.624 --> 15:01.673
We had a deal.

15:01.674 --> 15:04.368
He told me that if he screwed up, I could show this to his parents.

15:04.369 --> 15:05.885
Revenge.

15:05.886 --> 15:09.775
Don't you think that maybe he's telling the truth about him and Anna?

15:10.133 --> 15:13.040
I mean, do you really think that they would do that to you?

15:17.700 --> 15:19.038
Hi.

15:21.236 --> 15:23.888
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.

15:24.318 --> 15:26.717
- Oh, my God. 
- No.

15:26.729 --> 15:28.991
Hi, Anna. It's good to see you again.

15:28.992 --> 15:30.552
You, too.

15:30.560 --> 15:33.169
I'm going to go... try this on.

15:33.305 --> 15:34.935
I need you.

15:38.679 --> 15:40.087
What are you doing here?

15:40.088 --> 15:42.702
Summer, I wanted to talk to you.

15:42.703 --> 15:43.941
You have to believe me.

15:43.942 --> 15:46.813
There is nothing going on between me and Seth.

15:46.814 --> 15:48.837
You are still my Blanche, you know?

15:48.838 --> 15:51.105
Nice try. I saw you guys hugging at the airport.

15:51.106 --> 15:55.084
That was... not what you think it was. We were celebrating.

15:55.085 --> 15:56.718
Celebrating what?

15:57.500 --> 15:59.126
The future.

15:59.624 --> 16:02.722
If I flew 2,000 miles, I'd probably come up with a better story.

16:02.723 --> 16:03.934
No, it's the truth. Seth...

16:03.935 --> 16:06.352
Look. My date's going to be here soon. He's kind of a rock star.

16:06.353 --> 16:08.366
You may have heard of him, Big Korea.

16:08.867 --> 16:11.686
Yeah. Well, not surprised. Thanks for coming by.

16:11.687 --> 16:12.893
Summer...

16:14.672 --> 16:16.446
Look, Summer, I'm sorry that you don't believe me,

16:16.447 --> 16:21.353
but if you're already going with someone, would you mind if I went with Seth?

16:21.669 --> 16:23.502
Why would I mind?

16:23.733 --> 16:25.653
Okay, then. I'll see you there.

16:25.654 --> 16:26.983
See ya.

16:57.664 --> 17:00.622
So, uh, how exactly does this plan go again?

17:00.623 --> 17:03.556
Summer sees me with Anna at the dance,

17:03.557 --> 17:06.880
and confronted with the reality of a world without Seth Cohen,

17:06.881 --> 17:08.123
she comes to her senses.

17:08.124 --> 17:09.743
Uh-huh, because a world without you...

17:09.744 --> 17:11.747
Is a world without sun.

17:11.748 --> 17:14.854
Ryan,  it's a world without warmth.

17:15.746 --> 17:18.858
I don't get it, either, but I think we should trust Anna on this one.

17:18.859 --> 17:22.468
She has more knowledge of the female psyche than either you or I could hope for.

17:22.469 --> 17:23.963
That's so true.

17:27.525 --> 17:28.899
Aren't you guys ready yet?

17:28.900 --> 17:30.704
People are going to be here.

17:33.219 --> 17:34.647
What is it? What's wrong?

17:34.648 --> 17:37.941
No. You look... I'm getting ready still.

19:04.269 --> 19:06.374
- Hello, welcome.
- These are my parents.

19:06.375 --> 19:08.439
How are you? Nice to see you.

19:08.440 --> 19:09.903
Come on in.

19:14.110 --> 19:16.230
- You look beautiful.
- You, too.

19:23.184 --> 19:24.813
That's Summer's date.

19:25.166 --> 19:27.291
Looks like the guy in Full Metal Alchemist.

19:27.292 --> 19:30.159
Kirsten, here are the Yangs, Elena and Tom.

19:30.160 --> 19:32.015
- Hey. How are you?
- Hey.

19:32.016 --> 19:34.192
- Hi. 
- Oh, my God, you look beautiful.

19:34.193 --> 19:35.781
You too. It's good to see you.

19:37.982 --> 19:39.606
Glad you could make it.

19:40.879 --> 19:44.428
Ryan. I'm so glad that you and Seth found dates.

19:44.429 --> 19:45.442
Thank you.

19:45.443 --> 19:48.035
So I'm going to need 50 bucks from each of you for the after-party.

19:48.036 --> 19:49.453
Oh, I'll take care of that.

19:49.496 --> 19:50.496
There you go.

19:50.497 --> 19:51.879
Thank you, very much Mr. Cohen.

19:51.880 --> 19:53.612
You're welcome. Attention, everybody:

19:53.613 --> 19:54.800
The limos are waiting, so, ladies,

19:54.801 --> 19:57.307
please put your purses and your wraps and things on the bar,

19:57.308 --> 20:00.814
so we can all go out to the pool and take pictures.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.582
All right?

20:04.026 --> 20:05.848
- Yeah, yeah. 
- Where's the bathroom?

20:05.849 --> 20:07.577
Uh... down the hall.

21:07.498 --> 21:11.287
Okay, you guys, we all need one with all of the kids. Get together.

21:15.760 --> 21:19.305
Oh, hey. Has anyone seen Kevin? I think he's still in the bathroom.

21:19.306 --> 21:20.957
All right, I'll get him.

21:41.609 --> 21:44.148
The, uh, the parents want to take a photo of everyone.

21:44.149 --> 21:45.588
We're waiting on you.

21:48.583 --> 21:49.865
Fine.

21:51.576 --> 21:52.886
Look.

21:53.835 --> 21:55.388
What now?

21:55.389 --> 21:57.052
You going to tell me I can't drink?

21:57.053 --> 21:58.910
No, actually I don't have a problem with your drinking,

21:58.911 --> 22:01.804
but if you screw this up for Marissa,

22:01.805 --> 22:03.561
I'm going to kick your ass.

22:03.562 --> 22:05.033
Okay.

22:21.144 --> 22:23.055
Oh, my God. You know what this is?

22:23.056 --> 22:23.860
What?

22:23.861 --> 22:27.246
This is the pirates' cave from Goonies. I've died and gone to heaven.

22:27.247 --> 22:29.037
Taylor, this is amazing.

22:29.038 --> 22:32.117
Yeah, this is way better than any dance I ever designed.

22:32.118 --> 22:34.353
Oh, my God, Marissa, that means so much to me.

22:34.354 --> 22:37.092
You know, I've been saying that, but no one listens.

22:37.545 --> 22:40.452
Wow, Seth, you and I at prom together, who would have thought.

22:40.453 --> 22:44.125
I know. I guess sometimes things just work out.

22:47.321 --> 22:48.734
Laughing boy.

22:48.788 --> 22:50.978
Hi. Where's that flask you're always whipping out?

22:50.979 --> 22:53.053
Oh, you want to spike the punch?

22:53.054 --> 22:54.047
Read my mind.

22:54.048 --> 22:55.341
All right. Follow me.

22:55.342 --> 22:57.173
That's so unlike you.

22:57.485 --> 22:58.694
Big Korea.

22:58.695 --> 23:01.012
Hi. Hi.

23:01.087 --> 23:03.166
Come on, go.

23:04.810 --> 23:07.493
Why don't I go put my purse down and then we can hit the dance floor?

23:07.494 --> 23:08.940
- All right.
- Okay.

23:10.471 --> 23:11.424
You sure about this?

23:11.425 --> 23:13.870
Yes, Seth, you're just going to have to trust me.

23:13.871 --> 23:16.315
Come on, let's go take a picture with Captain Hook.

23:16.316 --> 23:17.784
- All right.
- Come on.

23:23.387 --> 23:25.263
- Oh, hi, Lisa.
- Hi.

23:25.264 --> 23:26.815
I'm so glad you made it back for prom.

23:26.816 --> 23:28.467
I wouldn't have missed it for anything.

23:28.468 --> 23:30.124
Or... I thought you did great on Idol.

23:30.125 --> 23:33.531
Oh, by the way, do you know where Simon gets those skintight V-necks?

23:33.532 --> 23:35.678
I totally want to get one for Sung Ho.

23:37.721 --> 23:39.676
Have I thanked you yet for coming?

23:39.677 --> 23:42.541
Mm, about 40 times.

23:42.668 --> 23:43.783
Is something wrong?

23:43.784 --> 23:46.431
Your little friend walked off with my flask.

23:46.432 --> 23:49.020
Yeah, well, I'm sure she'll bring it back.

23:53.978 --> 23:57.676
All right, well, I'm going to go smoke some kush.

23:57.677 --> 23:59.198
Want to come?

23:59.659 --> 24:01.987
You know, I actually kind of want to enjoy prom,

24:01.988 --> 24:04.586
but come find me when you get back.

24:09.094 --> 24:12.021
Did I hear something about smoking certain substances?

24:12.022 --> 24:13.915
'Cause I know someplace private.

24:15.645 --> 24:17.247
Lead the way.

24:27.090 --> 24:28.586
Maybe I'm being sentimental,

24:28.587 --> 24:31.047
but watching the kids head off to the senior prom,

24:31.048 --> 24:33.707
I can't help but think, where did the time go.

24:33.708 --> 24:36.602
I remember the first day that Summer went off to kindergarten.

24:36.603 --> 24:38.740
She changed her outfit three times,

24:38.741 --> 24:42.808
and she came home from school crying because another girl was wearing the same top.

24:42.897 --> 24:44.704
The other girl was Marissa.

24:44.705 --> 24:45.542
Of course.

24:45.543 --> 24:49.222
And wasn't it kindergarten that Seth would only answer to Boba Fett?

24:49.223 --> 24:50.685
Gosh, Boba Fett.

24:50.686 --> 24:52.165
That was fourth grade.

24:52.166 --> 24:53.852
No, it was fifth grade.

24:53.853 --> 24:57.247
Gosh, you know, I just can't believe that I was only a year older

24:57.248 --> 25:00.068
than Marissa is now when I married Jimmy.

25:00.069 --> 25:03.015
It's amazing the surprises life brings you.

25:03.016 --> 25:05.247
- Some good, I hope.
- Very good.

25:05.248 --> 25:07.624
I'd like to propose a toast to the two of you.

25:07.625 --> 25:10.039
I'm sorry Sandy and I haven't thrown you an engagement party,

25:10.040 --> 25:11.673
but we couldn't be more pleased.

25:11.674 --> 25:12.699
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

25:12.700 --> 25:13.915
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

25:13.916 --> 25:16.585
Wouldn't you know? I'm sorry.

25:17.071 --> 25:19.848
I have to take this; it's a colleague. I'll be right back.

25:21.760 --> 25:23.173
Such a busy man.

25:23.174 --> 25:24.564
Yes.

25:24.701 --> 25:28.953
Well, I just hope Neil and I are as happy as you and Sandy.

25:31.414 --> 25:33.632
No, actually, I'm having dinner at his home right now.

25:33.633 --> 25:35.169
What's up?

25:41.583 --> 25:42.978
Can I tell him?

25:45.036 --> 25:46.311
Right.

25:46.603 --> 25:47.889
Okay.

26:11.277 --> 26:13.027
- All right, I feel good about that.
- All right.

26:13.028 --> 26:14.420
- Why don't we go dance?
- Thank you.

26:14.421 --> 26:15.692
Like dancing...

26:35.352 --> 26:36.936
I'm just going to go talk to her.

26:36.937 --> 26:38.916
No, Seth, you can't.

26:38.917 --> 26:41.326
Well, look at her-- she looks miserable.

26:42.030 --> 26:44.805
Let alone... kind of plastered.

26:44.806 --> 26:46.707
Well, that's the point.

26:46.708 --> 26:49.089
At least the miserable part.

26:52.787 --> 26:54.272
I don't think I can do this.

26:54.273 --> 26:56.136
Seth, the plan is working.

26:56.137 --> 26:57.892
I mean, it was easy for her to doubt you

26:57.893 --> 27:00.330
when you're all begging to get back together with her.

27:00.331 --> 27:03.079
But now that she might have really lost you,

27:03.080 --> 27:07.005
she's thinking, maybe I should have really believed him.

27:12.123 --> 27:14.927
Really? 'Cause it looks to me like she's describing

27:14.928 --> 27:19.272
how she'd use my body for food then feed my bones to the sharks.

27:20.253 --> 27:23.330
Excuse me, can I have your attention, please?

27:23.331 --> 27:24.677
Hi.

27:24.678 --> 27:29.080
I would like to welcome you all to the Pirate's Ball.

27:30.009 --> 27:31.567
Thank you.

27:32.020 --> 27:36.136
Okay, now, uh, before I announce your pirate king and queen,

27:36.137 --> 27:39.227
I would just like to take this moment to...

27:39.228 --> 27:42.387
say that it's been an honor to be your social chair this year...

27:42.388 --> 27:44.345
Just open the envelopes!

27:46.157 --> 27:50.582
Well, excuse me if I have slaved away all year just so you could have a good time.

27:50.583 --> 27:52.067
Boring.

27:55.316 --> 27:56.687
Fine.

27:57.018 --> 27:59.167
Oh, um, just so you know,

27:59.168 --> 28:01.634
I thought it was only fair to take myself out of the running,

28:01.635 --> 28:04.457
so no calling for a recount.

28:07.447 --> 28:09.335
Okay, uh...

28:09.627 --> 28:12.858
Your 2006 queen is...

28:13.779 --> 28:16.426
Oh, my God, two years in a row, Summer Roberts.

28:16.427 --> 28:17.762
Oh, my God.

28:21.303 --> 28:22.986
Go, Summ!

28:26.097 --> 28:30.049
Oh, my God. I don't think you're boring. I love you.

28:30.050 --> 28:33.510
Thank you so much. Thank you so much.

28:33.555 --> 28:36.998
I like you guys, thank you so much.

28:36.999 --> 28:38.969
You guys... What's going on?

28:38.970 --> 28:41.694
- Oh, tiara.
- Oh, tiara.

28:41.695 --> 28:43.874
Okay, thanks.

28:43.875 --> 28:49.304
Um, yeah, so thank you so much because being your queen is just...

28:49.305 --> 28:51.484
Is it like a million degrees in here or what?

28:51.485 --> 28:52.354
Woo, it's hot.

28:52.355 --> 28:54.861
You know what? Perhaps we should find out who your king is.

28:54.862 --> 28:56.230
Screw that.

28:56.231 --> 29:01.310
You know what? Actually, let me, um... introduce you to my date.

29:01.311 --> 29:02.837
Hold this.

29:03.529 --> 29:06.348
He's right here. This is my date.

29:06.349 --> 29:10.769
He is the number one pop star in Korea.

29:15.625 --> 29:16.905
Bang bang.

29:16.906 --> 29:21.555
Anyway, I promised him that if I won

29:21.556 --> 29:25.289
that I would give him a big fat kiss.

29:28.359 --> 29:29.642
This is not part of the plan.

29:29.643 --> 29:32.821
She's just fighting it. This is good.

29:37.988 --> 29:40.350
How do you like that, Cohen?

29:40.517 --> 29:42.724
Man overboard! Man overboard!

29:42.725 --> 29:45.776
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

29:45.978 --> 29:48.484
What idiot made that stage so short?

29:48.485 --> 29:50.057
Summer, are you okay?

29:50.058 --> 29:51.287
Back off.

29:51.288 --> 29:52.952
Whoa, um.

29:52.953 --> 29:55.929
Just, everyone leave me alone.

29:56.308 --> 29:59.455
She probably just needs a moist washcloth or maybe like a towelette.

29:59.456 --> 30:01.000
- Cohen.
- What? What?

30:01.001 --> 30:02.736
Is there a "no towelette" clause in your plan?

30:02.737 --> 30:05.140
Because right now I'm thinking phase two kind of sucks.

30:05.141 --> 30:08.459
Does anyone have a towelette? Does anyone have a towelette?

30:08.460 --> 30:09.804
- We must find a towelette!
- Is she all right?

30:09.805 --> 30:12.349
Yeah, I think maybe it's time to go to the after-party, though.

30:12.350 --> 30:13.162
That's a good idea.

30:13.163 --> 30:16.139
Hey, I couldn't find Kevin. He just disappeared.

30:16.140 --> 30:17.450
Okay, I'll find him.

30:18.691 --> 30:21.147
Oh, right, I better go...

30:27.855 --> 30:29.080
Who is it?

30:30.031 --> 30:33.118
Um, this is the guy, I...

30:33.119 --> 30:37.900
I told him I was coming here tonight and I should probably take this.

30:37.901 --> 30:39.761
I'm sorry, I know, it's gotten a little crazy.

30:39.762 --> 30:41.740
Yeah. A little crazy.

30:41.741 --> 30:42.922
Little bit.

30:42.923 --> 30:47.276
But there's no place that I would rather be.

30:48.335 --> 30:50.445
And that's what I'm going to tell him.

30:52.977 --> 30:54.586
I'll see you in a minute.

31:20.666 --> 31:22.029
Ryan?

31:23.644 --> 31:25.554
Hey, what are you doing?

31:25.555 --> 31:29.080
So Sung Ho and his cousin got Summ in the limo, but have you found Kevin?

31:29.081 --> 31:30.548
No, no, let's look inside.

31:30.549 --> 31:32.125
Oh, he might have come out here to smoke.

31:32.126 --> 31:33.164
No, he didn't, I checked.

31:33.165 --> 31:34.249
- You checked?
- Yeah.

31:34.250 --> 31:35.688
Why are you being weird?

31:35.689 --> 31:37.637
Are you sure he's not out here?

31:40.211 --> 31:41.942
Oh, my God.

31:42.735 --> 31:43.933
Get out of here.

31:43.934 --> 31:45.193
What?

31:45.194 --> 31:47.166
Get out of here.

31:47.427 --> 31:48.998
Jerk.

31:57.132 --> 31:58.792
Is that it? Can I go now?

31:58.793 --> 32:01.072
- Why?
- What did you expect, huh?

32:01.073 --> 32:04.026
Did you think you were just going to dress up your bad boy,

32:04.027 --> 32:07.659
take him to your little rich kid's party, so your friends can see how cool you are?

32:07.660 --> 32:09.739
- You know it's not like that.
- Oh, please.

32:09.740 --> 32:13.566
You just wanted to turn me into little bitch boy like him.

32:16.099 --> 32:18.790
You're nothing like him.

32:19.233 --> 32:21.900
Clearly, I was wrong about you.

32:22.196 --> 32:25.131
Finally, you're learning.

32:55.451 --> 32:58.349
Honestly, Kirsten, I'm so glad you guys are doing better.

32:58.350 --> 33:00.267
You really scared me last week.

33:00.268 --> 33:02.209
I even scared myself.

33:05.394 --> 33:06.762
Julie...

33:08.446 --> 33:10.680
last week at dinner, I had a drink.

33:10.933 --> 33:12.219
What?! Oh, my God.

33:12.220 --> 33:14.738
Now, it was the first in 11 months, it was only one glass,

33:14.739 --> 33:19.204
I've been going to AA meetings every day, but it happened.

33:19.346 --> 33:20.781
Have you talked to Sandy about this?

33:20.782 --> 33:24.713
No. I tried, even before when I could feel it coming, but...

33:24.714 --> 33:27.029
Kirsten, you have to tell him.

33:27.030 --> 33:29.540
That the stress of our marriage has triggered my drinking?

33:29.541 --> 33:31.483
Yes, that's exactly what you say.

33:31.484 --> 33:35.570
I am not gonna use my alcoholism as blackmail to save our marriage.

33:35.571 --> 33:39.672
If he can't value it for what it is, then what is the point?

33:42.340 --> 33:44.172
Well, what are you gonna do?

33:45.381 --> 33:46.899
I don't know.

33:47.743 --> 33:51.151
The way things are between Sandy and I right now,

33:51.479 --> 33:55.548
I just feel like one push could send us over the edge.

34:12.493 --> 34:16.194
Hello? Trash cans exist for a reason.

34:17.840 --> 34:20.335
Oh... Excuse me. Hi.

34:20.335 --> 34:23.739
I have a security deposit on this place, and I'd like it back.

34:26.898 --> 34:30.722
Hey, so, the guy at the door is gonna let me know if Volchek tries to get in.

34:30.723 --> 34:31.864
How you doing?

34:31.866 --> 34:33.097
I'm okay.

34:33.098 --> 34:34.975
You know, I think I'm just gonna go home, though.

34:34.976 --> 34:36.168
Marissa, this is your prom.

34:36.168 --> 34:40.341
Yeah, it was prom before my boyfriend hooked up with another girl.

34:41.072 --> 34:44.398
Um... okay, I'm gonna go get a drink.

35:05.907 --> 35:08.509
Summer, it's us. How you feeling?

35:09.061 --> 35:12.193
Go away, let me die alone.

35:12.648 --> 35:15.583
I think it's time for phase three.

35:15.871 --> 35:18.262
There's a phase three? Why didn't you mention that before?

35:18.263 --> 35:20.350
Duh, there's always been a phase three.

35:20.351 --> 35:23.977
The other two were just to make you realize that you don't have a choice.

35:23.978 --> 35:26.495
You have to tell her the truth, about everything.

35:26.496 --> 35:28.161
Who is she talking about?

35:28.162 --> 35:32.533
I bet you think it's really smart because she's the smart girl.

35:32.707 --> 35:37.269
I'm gonna go. I fly back tomorrow, but I'll see you both in Providence.

35:37.270 --> 35:39.742
Summer, feel better.

35:39.743 --> 35:42.114
And remember Seth loves you.

35:42.631 --> 35:44.354
Anna, thank you.

35:45.925 --> 35:47.216
Bye.

35:49.084 --> 35:53.229
You know what? I don't think she's that smart. I think that she's dumb.

35:53.230 --> 35:56.010
She's got a dumb name and dumb hair.

35:56.011 --> 35:59.500
Listen, I don't expect you to respond or even remember this,

35:59.501 --> 36:02.921
but the truth is, I actually didn't get in to Brown.

36:02.922 --> 36:04.492
What?!

36:05.714 --> 36:06.726
Too fast.

36:06.727 --> 36:10.130
I knew you weren't gonna go if I didn't go, and I didn't want you to do that,

36:10.131 --> 36:13.263
and I didn't want you to miss the opportunity, so I broke up with you.

36:13.919 --> 36:16.978
That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

36:16.979 --> 36:19.217
Yeah, well, then I realized I couldn't be without you,

36:19.218 --> 36:21.259
so I flew there to try and talk my way in.

36:21.260 --> 36:25.310
Okay, now that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

36:26.587 --> 36:29.477
But it's very romantic. Did it work?

36:29.506 --> 36:30.868
No, it didn't.

36:30.869 --> 36:33.671
But Anna got me an interview at RISD, and they read my comic book,

36:33.672 --> 36:35.217
and they really liked it, so...

36:35.218 --> 36:38.621
So that's why you were hugging her at the airport? Oh, my God.

36:38.622 --> 36:42.669
Listen, I know I promised I'd never lie again when I gave you that letter.

36:42.670 --> 36:43.833
Oh, my God, the letter.

36:43.834 --> 36:45.447
What?

36:45.448 --> 36:47.763
Cohen, I have a confession.

36:53.229 --> 36:54.731
Oh, wow.

36:54.804 --> 36:56.816
Wow, that's impressive.

37:01.957 --> 37:04.782
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

37:06.011 --> 37:07.860
We can kiss later.

37:08.628 --> 37:10.895
All right, want me to hold your crown?

37:10.896 --> 37:12.801
- No!
- All right.

37:13.140 --> 37:17.218
Hey... rigatoni-- nice.

37:18.286 --> 37:19.800
What's going on?

37:21.537 --> 37:24.866
Listen, that call I got was a friend of mine on the hospital board,

37:24.867 --> 37:27.813
and, um, there are rumors floating around

37:27.814 --> 37:31.198
about certain improprieties concerning Griffin and you.

37:31.754 --> 37:34.362
Monday morning the board is gonna suspend Griffin,

37:34.363 --> 37:38.931
and they're gonna call for a criminal investigation into the both of you.

37:40.023 --> 37:42.764
Neil, it's getting late-- I think we should be going.

37:42.765 --> 37:45.021
Yeah, right. Kirsten, thanks for a lovely evening.

37:45.022 --> 37:46.037
Oh, my pleasure.

37:46.038 --> 37:48.276
Well, we'll walk you out.

37:49.583 --> 37:50.816
Is everything okay?

37:50.817 --> 37:52.354
Yeah.

38:45.383 --> 38:48.498
Well, she's not here-- she must've gone home.

38:48.795 --> 38:50.098
She'll be okay.

38:50.099 --> 38:52.714
You know, you probably don't see it, but she's changed.

38:52.715 --> 38:54.559
She's gotten stronger.

38:55.056 --> 38:57.479
- So have you.
- Yeah? Think so?

38:57.480 --> 39:00.932
The Ryan I knew would've gotten in a fight with that guy back at the prom.

39:00.933 --> 39:04.256
I know part of you still wants to, but you didn't.

39:04.257 --> 39:05.935
And that's what matters.

39:09.377 --> 39:10.902
So, you like the new me.

39:10.903 --> 39:14.293
Well... he's still not much of a dancer, but...

39:14.294 --> 39:15.709
What?!

39:19.276 --> 39:21.048
You're right, I'm not.

39:23.428 --> 39:27.578
You know, nothing between us could ever be casual-- there's too much history.

39:27.579 --> 39:29.033
Yeah, I know.

39:29.579 --> 39:31.949
I just don't think that anything should happen tonight.

39:31.950 --> 39:34.015
Absolutely not. Absolutely...

39:34.016 --> 39:35.775
Okay, good.

39:42.295 --> 39:44.811
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!

39:44.812 --> 39:46.183
- Taylor, what happened?
- Oh, my God.

39:46.184 --> 39:49.944
The money is gone! I had the money in my purse. I had $5,000 in my purse. It's gone.

39:49.945 --> 39:52.474
I brought it down at prom-- someone must've taken it.

39:52.475 --> 39:54.216
We should call the police.

39:55.013 --> 39:57.214
You know what, don't bother, don't bother. I know where it is.

39:57.215 --> 39:59.946
What do you mean, you know? I think I'm gonna hyperventilate.

39:59.947 --> 40:02.372
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, it will be.

40:18.258 --> 40:19.754
What do you want?

40:20.477 --> 40:22.678
You decide how this is gonna go.

40:25.664 --> 40:28.347
Prom, huh? Hell of a night.

40:32.619 --> 40:34.554
You probably think I'm an idiot, huh?

40:34.555 --> 40:36.634
Screw things up with Marissa,

40:36.635 --> 40:38.823
steal money when everyone's gonna know I took it.

40:38.824 --> 40:40.922
I don't think about you.

40:40.970 --> 40:42.874
But yes, you're an idiot.

40:43.011 --> 40:45.608
Maybe it wasn't gonna work out with Marissa.

40:45.839 --> 40:47.575
And at least now...

40:51.619 --> 40:53.783
...you and I can settle this.

40:54.056 --> 40:55.285
I'm not here to fight you.

40:55.286 --> 40:56.571
Sure you are.

40:56.572 --> 40:58.405
Otherwise, you'd have called the police.

40:58.406 --> 41:01.481
Come on. You know you're dying to.

41:01.482 --> 41:03.413
Just give in.

41:03.903 --> 41:07.729
All right, all right, all right, I get it-- it's about the money.

41:07.730 --> 41:09.564
