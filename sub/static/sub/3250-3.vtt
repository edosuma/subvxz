WEBVTT

00:24.107 --> 00:25.905
- What's wrong?
- Man wounded.

00:30.489 --> 00:31.661
Wake him.

00:35.410 --> 00:38.084
He slipped in the bilge water, Captain,
and fell under the rigger.

00:38.163 --> 00:39.836
His hand...

00:40.999 --> 00:42.546
I don't know if he'll survive.

00:53.178 --> 00:54.555
You're a dead man, McGrath.

00:58.225 --> 00:59.351
Same as all the others.

01:07.818 --> 01:08.819
She's here.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.079
Oh, save our souls.

01:11.154 --> 01:13.498
- I've got to escape!
- Don't go out there! McGrath!

01:13.574 --> 01:16.043
Don't listen, for God's sake.
The siren is a-calling!

01:51.153 --> 01:52.279
Same as all the others.

01:52.362 --> 01:54.615
No sign of a struggle.
No bones or blood.

01:54.698 --> 01:57.872
We're shark bait,
every single one of us.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.999
Stuck on the ocean. Waiting.

02:00.078 --> 02:01.796
Until the wind changes.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.505
- What's that?
- That's the creature. It's returned.

02:12.924 --> 02:14.346
Yo ho ho!

02:16.178 --> 02:18.351
Or does nobody actually say that?

03:00.097 --> 03:01.690
We made no signal.

03:01.765 --> 03:03.938
Our sensors picked you up.
Ship in distress.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.519
- Sensors?
- Yes.

03:05.602 --> 03:08.151
Okay, problem word, 17th century.

03:08.230 --> 03:12.155
My ship automatically...noticed-ish

03:12.234 --> 03:14.703
that your ship was having some bother.

03:14.778 --> 03:16.155
That big blue crate?

03:16.446 --> 03:19.325
That is more magic, Captain Avery.
They're spirits.

03:19.408 --> 03:21.376
How else would they have
found their way below decks?

03:21.451 --> 03:23.704
Well... I want to say
multi-dimensional engineering,

03:23.787 --> 03:26.336
but since you had a problem
with sensors I won't go there. Look.

03:26.415 --> 03:31.717
I'm the Doctor, this is Amy, Row.
We're sailors, same as you. Arr!

03:34.089 --> 03:36.933
Except for the gun thing.
And the beardiness.

03:37.008 --> 03:38.726
You're stowaways!

03:38.802 --> 03:40.224
Only explanation.

03:40.262 --> 03:43.766
Eight days we've been stranded here,
becalmed.

03:44.433 --> 03:46.652
You must have stowed away
before we sailed.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.070
What do we do with them?

03:48.145 --> 03:49.943
Oh, I think,
they deserve our hospitality.

03:53.150 --> 03:55.278
I suppose laughing like that
is in the job description.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.782
"Can you do the laugh? Check.

03:56.820 --> 03:59.289
"Grab yourself a parrot.
Welcome aboard."

03:59.364 --> 04:01.867
Stocks are low.
Only one barrel of water remains.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.703
We don't need three more
empty bellies to fill.

04:04.786 --> 04:06.663
- Take the doxy below, to the galley.
- Hey.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.465
Set her to work.
She won't need much feeding.

04:08.540 --> 04:11.589
- Row, a little help?
- Hey, listen, right.

04:11.668 --> 04:13.170
She's not a doxy.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.426
I didn't mean just tell him off.
Thanks anyway.

04:16.130 --> 04:19.180
If you're lucky, you'll drown
before the sharks can take a bite.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.851
If this is just because
I'm a captain too,

04:20.927 --> 04:22.224
you know, you shouldn't feel threatened.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.639
Your ship is much bigger than mine.

04:23.722 --> 04:25.941
And I don't have the cool boots
or a hat, even.

04:26.057 --> 04:27.149
Time to go.

04:28.185 --> 04:30.233
A bit more laughter, guys?

04:49.289 --> 04:52.759
Where are the rest of the crew?
This is a big ship, big for five of you.

04:52.834 --> 04:54.711
I suppose the rest of them
are hiding someplace

04:54.795 --> 04:57.344
and theyâ€™re all going to jump out
and shout boo.

04:57.380 --> 04:58.882
Boo!

05:00.258 --> 05:01.510
Throw the gun down.

05:07.766 --> 05:10.315
- The rest of you, on your knees.
- Amy, what are you doing?

05:10.393 --> 05:12.236
Saving your life.
Okay with that, are you?

05:12.312 --> 05:14.485
Put down the sword.
A sword could kill us all, girl.

05:14.564 --> 05:18.319
Yeah, thanks. That's actually
why I'm pointing it at you.

05:54.354 --> 05:55.355
Yarr!

06:03.071 --> 06:05.745
- You have killed me.
- No way. It's just a cut.

06:10.579 --> 06:14.049
- What kind of rubbish pirates are you?
- One drop. That's all it takes.

06:14.124 --> 06:16.502
One drop of blood
and she'll rise out of the ocean.

06:16.585 --> 06:20.385
Come on. I barely even scratched him.
What are you all in such a huff about?

06:24.467 --> 06:25.468
Ow, ah!

06:26.303 --> 06:27.680
Ow.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.151
Ah, Doctor, what's happening to me?

06:33.226 --> 06:34.728
She can smell the blood on your skin,

06:34.811 --> 06:36.984
- she's marked you for death.
- She?

06:37.063 --> 06:40.693
- A demon, out there in the ocean.
- Okay. Groovy.

06:40.775 --> 06:41.992
So not just pirates today.

06:42.068 --> 06:45.993
We've managed to bagsy a ship
where there's a demon popping in.

06:46.072 --> 06:48.370
Very efficient. I mean,
if something's going to kill you,

06:48.450 --> 06:50.794
it's nice that it drops you
a note to remind you.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.176
Quickly now.
Block out the sound.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.719
- What?
- The creature.

06:59.794 --> 07:01.888
She charms all her victims
with that song.

07:01.963 --> 07:05.092
Oh, great, so put my fingers in my ears.
That's your plan?

07:05.175 --> 07:09.396
Doctor, come on. Let's go. Let's get
back to the... Oh. Back to the...

07:13.016 --> 07:15.690
The music. It's working on him. Look.

07:15.769 --> 07:19.990
You are so beautiful.

07:20.023 --> 07:23.197
- What?
- Oh! No, I love your get-up.

07:23.276 --> 07:26.826
That's great. You should dress
as a pirate more often, huh?

07:26.863 --> 07:29.742
- Hey, hey, cuddle me, shipmate.
- Rory, stop.

07:29.824 --> 07:32.794
Everything is totally
brilliant, isn't it? Huh?

07:32.869 --> 07:36.214
Look at these brilliant pirates.
Look at their brilliant beards.

07:36.873 --> 07:38.250
I'd like a beard.

07:39.876 --> 07:42.004
- I'm going to grow a beard.
- You're not!

07:42.087 --> 07:43.555
The music turns them into fools.

07:46.091 --> 07:47.434
Oh, my God.

08:46.568 --> 08:49.242
- I have to touch her. Let me touch her!
- Sorry, but he is spoken for.

08:52.907 --> 08:55.251
Amy! Amy.

08:55.326 --> 08:56.828
Everybody into the hold.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.133
Rory! Come on.

09:05.295 --> 09:07.297
- Come on.
- Hey! Wait!

09:08.798 --> 09:09.799
Get off!

09:13.219 --> 09:16.018
- What is that thing?
- The legend. The siren.

09:16.639 --> 09:19.939
Many a merchant ship laden with
treasure has fallen prey to her.

09:20.018 --> 09:22.271
She's been hunting us
ever since we were becalmed.

09:22.353 --> 09:25.527
- Picking off the injured.
- Like a shark. A shark can smell blood.

09:25.607 --> 09:28.986
Okay. just like a shark,
in a dress and singing and green!

09:29.069 --> 09:31.197
A green singing shark
in an evening gown.

09:31.279 --> 09:33.498
- The ship is cursed.
- Yeah, right.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.247
"Cursed" is big with humans.
It means bad things are happening

09:36.326 --> 09:37.953
but you can't be bothered
to find an explanation.

09:38.036 --> 09:39.754
She's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

09:39.829 --> 09:43.049
Actually, I think you'll find she isn't.
We have to leave. Right now.

09:43.124 --> 09:46.094
- That crate of yours really is a ship?
- Well, it's not propelled by the wind.

09:46.169 --> 09:49.844
- Show me. Weigh anchor. Make it sail!
- And the gun's back.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.266
You're big on the gun thing, aren't you?

09:51.341 --> 09:54.720
Freud would say you're compensating.
Ever met Freud? No.

09:54.803 --> 09:57.272
- Comfy sofa.
- Leave the cursed one, Captain.

09:57.347 --> 09:59.190
- The creature can have him.
- Yes, please.

09:59.265 --> 10:00.767
We don't want the siren coming after us.

10:03.311 --> 10:05.234
- It's a leech!
- Everyone out of the water!

10:08.900 --> 10:11.119
It's bitten me, I'm bleeding!

10:18.034 --> 10:20.002
She wants blood.
Why does she want blood?

10:20.078 --> 10:21.876
What were you saying about
leaving the cursed ones behind?

10:21.955 --> 10:23.207
It's okay. We're safe down here.

10:23.289 --> 10:25.257
No curse is getting through
three solid inches of timber.

10:26.501 --> 10:30.005
Ah. Hello again.

10:34.050 --> 10:36.348
- No! No!
- No!

10:49.774 --> 10:51.902
- "Safe"?
- I have my good days and my had days.

10:51.943 --> 10:53.536
How did she get in?

10:53.611 --> 10:57.491
Bilge water.
She's using water like a portal. A door.

10:57.574 --> 11:00.043
She can materialise
through a single drop.

11:00.118 --> 11:01.415
We need to go somewhere with no water.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.246
Well, thank God we're not
in the middle of the ocean.

11:03.329 --> 11:04.546
Did you see her eyes?

11:04.581 --> 11:07.084
- Like crystal pools.
- You are in enough trouble.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.965
- The magazine!
- What?

11:09.043 --> 11:10.636
He means the armoury,
where the powder's stored.

11:10.712 --> 11:12.714
- It's dry as a bone.
- Good, let's go there.

11:12.797 --> 11:15.095
- I give the orders.
- Ah.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.393
Worried because I'm wearing a hat now?

11:18.970 --> 11:22.144
- Nobody touch anything sharp!
- Come on, Row.

11:27.854 --> 11:29.231
- Quickly, man.
- I... I can't.

11:29.731 --> 11:32.530
- The key is gone, Captain.
- How can it have gone?

11:37.739 --> 11:39.491
Someone else had the same idea.

11:47.332 --> 11:48.709
Barricade the door.

11:49.167 --> 11:50.464
Careful of that lantern.

11:50.919 --> 11:54.924
- Every barrel is full of powder.
- Who's been sleeping in my gun room?

12:06.601 --> 12:09.730
You fool! You fool, boy.

12:10.271 --> 12:11.488
What are you doing here?

12:11.564 --> 12:13.737
- Who is he?
- What, he's not one of the crew?

12:14.484 --> 12:15.701
No.

12:16.611 --> 12:17.658
He's my son.

12:22.909 --> 12:25.628
What in God's name possessed you, boy?

12:25.662 --> 12:27.039
Your mother will be searching for you.

12:34.879 --> 12:36.005
When?

12:36.631 --> 12:38.053
Last winter.

12:39.175 --> 12:40.301
Fever.

12:42.428 --> 12:43.975
She told me all about you.

12:44.847 --> 12:46.770
How you were a Captain in the Navy.

12:48.184 --> 12:50.357
"An honourable man," she said.

12:51.729 --> 12:53.902
How I would be proud to know you.

12:58.152 --> 13:00.496
- I've come to join your crew.
- I don't want you here.

13:01.739 --> 13:04.242
You can't send me back. It's too late.

13:04.701 --> 13:07.625
- We're a 100 miles from home.
- It's dangerous here.

13:07.662 --> 13:09.039
There is a monster aboard.

13:11.207 --> 13:12.925
She leaves a mark on men's skin.

13:16.462 --> 13:17.679
The black spot?

13:30.643 --> 13:33.647
There's nothing wrong with the boy.
He has no scars.

13:33.730 --> 13:37.735
- Yep. Ignore my last theory.
- He has his good days and his bad days.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.991
It's not just blood. She's coming
for all the sick and wounded,

13:41.070 --> 13:43.698
like a hunter chooses
his weakest animal.

13:43.781 --> 13:46.876
Okay, look. He's got fever.
The siren knows it.

13:46.951 --> 13:50.672
Humans. Second-rate. Damage too easily.

13:50.747 --> 13:53.375
It's only a matter of time
before everyone gets bruised.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.919
My ship.
It can sail us all away from here.

13:57.003 --> 13:59.005
You and me, we fetch it. Let's go.

13:59.088 --> 14:01.341
You're not the Captain here, remember?

14:09.140 --> 14:11.768
The water's dangerous.
That's how she gets through.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.478
One touch of her hand
and you're a dead man!

14:13.561 --> 14:17.156
- We're all cursed if we stay aboard.
- It's not a curse.

14:17.231 --> 14:19.575
Curse means game over.
Curse means we're helpless.

14:19.650 --> 14:21.869
We are not helpless!

14:22.945 --> 14:24.913
Captain, what's our next move?

14:26.657 --> 14:29.706
- Wait with the boy.
- Captain, we're all in danger here.

14:29.786 --> 14:32.835
I said wait and barricade
the door after we've gone.

14:32.914 --> 14:36.134
- Sure you want to go?
- We have to get Rory and Toby away.

14:36.209 --> 14:40.635
She's out there now, licking her lips,
boiling a saucepan, grating cheese.

14:41.381 --> 14:44.305
Okay. Well, remember if you get an itch,
don't scratch too hard.

14:45.259 --> 14:46.761
We've all got to go sometime.

14:51.849 --> 14:55.444
There are worse ways than having your
face snogged off by a dodgy mermaid.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.323
Do you want to draw lots
for who's in charge, then?

15:03.986 --> 15:06.205
Darkness. Demon.

15:07.490 --> 15:10.334
You can have first go.

15:20.294 --> 15:22.046
- Nearly.
- Phew!

15:29.470 --> 15:31.643
- By all the...
- Let me stop you there.

15:31.722 --> 15:32.894
Bigger on the inside.

15:32.974 --> 15:35.443
Don't mind, do you, if we just
skip to the end of that moment?

15:35.518 --> 15:38.818
Oh, and sorry I lied, by the way,
when I said yours was bigger.

15:38.896 --> 15:41.991
Kitchen that way. Choice of bathrooms
there, there, there.

15:46.362 --> 15:47.830
What's wrong?

15:48.823 --> 15:51.121
The most beautiful thing
you've ever seen.

15:52.076 --> 15:54.204
Oh, tell me I didn't really say that.

15:57.206 --> 15:58.207
What's going on?

15:58.291 --> 16:00.089
We're not staying here
to mollycoddle the boy.

16:00.168 --> 16:02.421
The Captain's gone soft.
It's time for us to leave.

16:07.592 --> 16:08.593
What's this do?

16:08.676 --> 16:11.020
That does very, very complicated.
That does sophisticated.

16:11.095 --> 16:12.847
That does whoa, amazing!

16:12.930 --> 16:16.400
And that does whizz, bang,
far too technical to explain!

16:16.476 --> 16:18.319
- Wheel?
- Atom accelerator.

16:18.394 --> 16:21.898
- It steers the thing.
- No! Sort of. Yes.

16:21.981 --> 16:26.327
Wheel. Telescope. Astrolabe. Compass.
A ship's a ship.

16:26.402 --> 16:27.619
Good man.

16:30.031 --> 16:34.662
He told you to wait, you dog.
He's your Captain. A naval officer.

16:34.744 --> 16:36.621
You're honour-bound to do
as he tells you.

16:36.704 --> 16:38.832
Honour-bound?
Do you know what kind of ship this is?

16:38.915 --> 16:41.634
- Do you know what your father does?
- Don't listen to him, Toby.

16:42.418 --> 16:45.262
We sail under the black flag.
The jolly Roger.

16:46.756 --> 16:47.973
Liar!

16:48.216 --> 16:50.594
- He's no wicked pirate!
- Oh, you think so?

16:51.427 --> 16:55.398
I've seen your father gun down
a thousand innocent men.

17:00.311 --> 17:02.530
This is how the professionals do it.

17:06.901 --> 17:10.326
Um, it's stuck. Not responding.

17:10.404 --> 17:12.906
- Becalmed?
- Mmm-hmm. Apparently. That's new.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.377
- You had to gloat, didn't you?
- I'm not gloating.

17:17.453 --> 17:19.955
I saw that look just now.
"Ha ha. His ship is rubbish."

17:20.039 --> 17:21.632
- True.
- Mmm-hmm.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.173
Get what treasure you can.
I'll meet you in the rowboat.

17:25.252 --> 17:28.006
You're going to remain at your post.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.927
I am not playing games with you, boy.
You put that down.

17:32.301 --> 17:35.350
One more step and I'll use this,
you blackguard.

17:35.429 --> 17:37.431
You don't know how to
fight with a cutlass, boy.

17:38.641 --> 17:39.938
Don't need to, do I?

17:40.810 --> 17:41.811
Ah!

17:46.315 --> 17:48.283
I can't get a lock on the plane.

17:48.359 --> 17:49.861
- The what?
- The space we travel in.

17:49.902 --> 17:53.623
The ocean. Sort of ocean but not water.
The Tardis can't see.

17:53.698 --> 17:55.746
It's sulking because it thinks
the space doesn't exist.

17:55.825 --> 17:58.294
Without a plane to lock onto
we're not going anywhere.

17:58.369 --> 17:59.416
I'm confused.

17:59.495 --> 18:01.338
Yeah, well, it's a big club.
We should get t-shirts.

18:07.336 --> 18:08.679
What's happening?

18:11.841 --> 18:15.812
- You little swabber!
- Congratulations. Made it to the menu.

18:15.886 --> 18:18.514
- Probably shouldn't go out there now.
- You scurvy ape!

18:18.806 --> 18:21.525
Don't shoot!
The powder will blow and kill us all.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.145
Mulligan, what are you doing?

18:27.898 --> 18:29.366
No honour among pirates.

18:36.866 --> 18:38.038
All right. She's had her little sulk.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.085
Now she's heading for
the full-on screaming tantrum.

18:40.161 --> 18:41.913
- Can you fix it?
- Oh!

18:41.996 --> 18:44.374
The parametric engines are jammed.
Orthogonal vector's gone.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.084
- I'm almost out of ideas.
- Almost?

18:46.167 --> 18:48.386
Well, we could try stroking her
and singing her a song.

18:48.461 --> 18:51.590
- Will that help?
- Hard to say. Never has before.

18:52.923 --> 18:54.220
I've lost control of her.

18:54.383 --> 18:57.136
She's about to dematerialise.
We could end up anywhere!

18:57.219 --> 18:59.347
- That sounds bad.
- Yes, it is!

19:00.681 --> 19:01.978
Out! Now!

19:03.309 --> 19:05.482
Abandon ship! Abandon ship!

19:18.783 --> 19:21.377
Okay. Okay. Oh, okay.

19:21.452 --> 19:24.501
Tardis runs off on its own.
That's a bit of a new one.

19:24.580 --> 19:26.582
Bang goes our only hope
of getting them out of here.

19:26.666 --> 19:29.169
Not much of a Captain
without a ship, are you?

19:37.218 --> 19:38.219
Mulligan?

19:38.511 --> 19:41.060
What are you doing? This is mutiny.

19:41.389 --> 19:43.062
She doesn't want me.

19:43.140 --> 19:46.110
She only wants Toby
and the scrawny looking fellow.

19:48.104 --> 19:49.947
He's got the last of the supplies.
We should go after him.

19:49.980 --> 19:52.278
Never mind the damned supplies.
What about my treasure?

20:00.908 --> 20:02.205
Don't get injured.

20:02.702 --> 20:03.874
Don't get injured!

20:12.378 --> 20:14.506
Come out of there,
you mutinous dog!

20:28.644 --> 20:31.614
She's inside. She's come for Mulligan.

20:48.122 --> 20:49.874
No water in here. How did she take him?

20:50.458 --> 20:52.802
You said she uses water like a door.
That's how she enters a room.

20:59.759 --> 21:00.760
I was wrong.

21:02.511 --> 21:04.388
Please ignore all my theories
up to this point.

21:04.472 --> 21:05.519
What? Again?

21:06.724 --> 21:08.476
We're all in danger.

21:09.477 --> 21:11.024
The water's not how she's getting in.

21:11.896 --> 21:13.364
When we were down in the hold,
think what happened.

21:13.439 --> 21:16.192
- You, me, Amy, Rory, leeches.
- She sprang from the water.

21:16.275 --> 21:19.745
Yes, only when it grew still!
Still water. Nature's mirror.

21:20.237 --> 21:22.660
- So... You mean?
- Yes. Not water.

21:24.909 --> 21:26.286
Reflection.

21:35.711 --> 21:37.964
The siren legend. The curse.

21:38.047 --> 21:40.800
- You said curses weren't real.
- Folklore springs from truth.

21:40.883 --> 21:42.726
She attacks ships filled with treasure.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.725
Where else do you get
a perfect reflection?

21:44.804 --> 21:46.397
- Polished metal.
- Hmm.

21:50.976 --> 21:52.398
We must warn them!

22:08.744 --> 22:12.339
- Amy! Open the door!
- Toby, open the door!

22:13.582 --> 22:14.708
Toby!

22:14.792 --> 22:16.840
- Open the door.
- Toby!

22:34.687 --> 22:37.941
We've got to destroy every reflection.
Gold, Silver, Glass.

22:38.023 --> 22:39.696
She could spring from any of them.

22:47.074 --> 22:49.577
Oh, yes, yes. I know, I know.
Very had luck to break it.

22:49.660 --> 22:50.912
But look at it this way.

22:50.995 --> 22:53.748
There's a stroppy, homicidal mermaid
trying to kill all.

22:54.623 --> 22:56.421
- How much worse can things get?
- Yep.

22:57.418 --> 22:58.544
Help me lug this lot out.

22:58.627 --> 23:00.345
- Where are we taking it?
- The ocean.

23:00.421 --> 23:02.094
No! No.

23:02.798 --> 23:04.550
This is the treasure
of the Mogul of India.

23:04.633 --> 23:07.386
Oh, good. For a moment there,
I thought it was yours.

23:07.469 --> 23:09.096
Doctor! Wait.

23:09.930 --> 23:11.022
Must we do this?

23:11.098 --> 23:14.773
Any reflection, any mirror
and the siren will attack.

23:14.852 --> 23:16.650
We have to protect Row and Toby.

23:18.063 --> 23:19.861
Go and get the crown from the storeroom.

23:52.181 --> 23:53.478
just wait?

23:54.141 --> 23:56.644
- Not my most dynamic plan, I realise.
- Tardis.

23:56.727 --> 23:58.479
- It's been towed.
- What?

23:59.271 --> 24:00.944
Sorry.
We might be stuck here for a while.

24:00.981 --> 24:03.200
Oh, so you're saying that we should
all just wait here below?

24:03.275 --> 24:05.573
The sea is still calm, like a mirror.

24:05.653 --> 24:07.530
If you go out on deck,
she'll rise up and attack you.

24:07.613 --> 24:09.536
It's okay. The calm won't last forever.

24:09.615 --> 24:11.743
When the wind picks up,
we'll all set sail.

24:11.825 --> 24:13.953
Until it does,
you have to hide down here.

24:29.760 --> 24:31.933
I'm sorry about your mother.

24:33.472 --> 24:34.598
You miss her a lot?

24:35.766 --> 24:38.110
Three years. No word from you.

24:39.061 --> 24:40.688
- Toby...
- You promised her.

24:41.981 --> 24:43.904
You promised you'd come home.

24:45.109 --> 24:46.611
And she believed you would,

24:48.153 --> 24:49.780
right up until the day she died.

24:55.536 --> 24:56.753
What made you do it?

24:57.287 --> 24:59.585
What made you turn pirate?

25:02.334 --> 25:03.631
Get some sleep now.

25:12.553 --> 25:14.931
It's fine.
You're doing fine.

25:15.931 --> 25:18.025
Just stay calm.

25:33.657 --> 25:35.785
It's not one star, it's two.

25:37.745 --> 25:39.213
The Dog Star.

25:40.622 --> 25:42.374
Sirius. Binary system.

25:42.458 --> 25:44.210
I use it to navigate the oceans.

25:46.503 --> 25:48.050
I've travelled far, like you.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.800
Space can be very lonely.

25:52.217 --> 25:55.187
The greatest adventure is having
someone share it with you.

25:57.014 --> 25:59.187
If we get out of this,
I'll take him back to England.

25:59.266 --> 26:00.734
He can't stay with me.

26:02.144 --> 26:03.521
I'm not the father he needs.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.157
Who are you, Henry Avery?

26:09.193 --> 26:11.867
Respected naval officer,
wife and child at home.

26:13.113 --> 26:14.581
How did you end up here,

26:14.656 --> 26:17.500
wandering the oceans
with a band of rogues?

26:22.122 --> 26:23.795
I've set my course now.

26:25.584 --> 26:27.131
Nothing I can do to alter it.

26:28.796 --> 26:31.219
People stared at it for centuries
and never knew.

26:33.008 --> 26:34.681
Things can suddenly change,

26:36.428 --> 26:37.930
when you're least expecting.

27:01.870 --> 27:03.087
- Doctor, um...
- Shh.

27:05.541 --> 27:06.713
What can you see?

27:08.794 --> 27:10.762
Feels like something's out there,

27:11.713 --> 27:13.340
staring straight at me.

27:20.848 --> 27:23.146
Man the sails!

27:27.312 --> 27:31.783
To the rigging, you dogs!
Let go the sails. Avast ye!

27:34.444 --> 27:36.788
Put the bunt into the slack
of the clews.

27:37.447 --> 27:39.620
I swear he's making half this stuff up.

27:39.700 --> 27:42.704
Well, we're going to need
some kind of phrase book.

27:47.291 --> 27:48.634
Toby!

27:48.709 --> 27:49.710
Find my coat.

27:51.378 --> 27:53.380
My compass is inside it, boy.

27:54.590 --> 27:56.558
Heave ho, you bilge rats.

27:57.342 --> 27:59.436
"Rats" was all I could hear.

28:43.931 --> 28:45.433
Don't let her take you!

28:56.360 --> 28:57.577
No!

28:58.946 --> 29:00.414
No!

29:00.489 --> 29:01.832
Hang on!

29:07.496 --> 29:08.543
No!

29:10.123 --> 29:12.046
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

29:13.377 --> 29:15.425
You couldn't give up the gold,
could you?

29:15.462 --> 29:17.260
That's why you turned pirate!

29:17.547 --> 29:20.391
Your commission, your wife, your son!

29:21.218 --> 29:24.097
Just how much
is that treasure worth to you, man?

29:26.890 --> 29:28.733
Rory! ROW!

29:28.809 --> 29:33.315
- Row!
- I can't see him. Doctor, I'm going in!

29:37.192 --> 29:40.617
He's drowning. He's drowning!
You go in after him, you'll drown too.

29:41.488 --> 29:42.865
There's only one thing
that can save him now.

29:42.948 --> 29:45.042
- What are you talking about?
- The siren.

29:45.534 --> 29:47.707
The siren, she wants him.
We have to release her.

29:48.412 --> 29:49.834
Doctor, no.

29:55.002 --> 29:56.003
No!

29:59.756 --> 30:01.724
He's drowning. Go find him!

30:09.308 --> 30:10.901
What did you do?

30:10.976 --> 30:13.855
- If he stays in there, he'll die.
- But she'll destroy him.

30:13.937 --> 30:16.986
That thing isn't just a ravenous hunter.
It's intelligent.

30:17.065 --> 30:18.783
We can reason with it. And maybe,

30:18.859 --> 30:21.408
just maybe,
they're still alive somewhere.

30:22.029 --> 30:24.657
- We have to follow her.
- Are you mad?

30:24.740 --> 30:28.745
If we ever want to see them again,
we have to let the siren take us.

30:29.369 --> 30:30.746
We'll prick our fingers.

30:32.456 --> 30:33.878
All agreed?

30:35.167 --> 30:36.919
- Yeah?
- Aye.

30:38.170 --> 30:39.387
- Aye.
- Aye!

31:14.456 --> 31:15.548
Where are we?

31:17.376 --> 31:18.593
We haven't moved.

31:19.461 --> 31:21.634
We're in exactly
the same place as before.

31:23.840 --> 31:27.686
- We're on a ghost ship.
- No. It's real.

31:28.512 --> 31:30.355
A space ship trapped in a temporal rift.

31:30.972 --> 31:33.270
How can two ships be in the same place?

31:33.850 --> 31:36.353
Not the same. Two planes, two worlds.

31:36.895 --> 31:39.523
Two cars parked in the same space.

31:39.606 --> 31:41.984
There are lots of different universes
nested inside each other.

31:42.067 --> 31:46.664
Now and again they collide.
And you can step from one to the other.

31:47.406 --> 31:49.534
Okay. I think I understand.

31:49.616 --> 31:51.744
Good. 'Cause it's not like that at all,
but if that helps.

31:51.827 --> 31:52.828
Thanks.

31:52.911 --> 31:56.085
All the reflections have
suddenly become gateways.

32:04.840 --> 32:08.060
Ever look in a mirror and think
you're seeing a whole other world?

32:09.219 --> 32:11.267
Well, this time it's not an illusion.

32:18.603 --> 32:20.571
- The signal.
- Yes?

32:21.898 --> 32:23.866
- The distress call.
- Uh-huh.

32:25.569 --> 32:27.446
There was a second ship here
all the time.

32:28.655 --> 32:30.749
And the siren is on board.

32:39.040 --> 32:40.166
Dead.

33:01.563 --> 33:05.318
You were right, there was something
staring at us the whole time.

33:05.400 --> 33:07.494
How long has this ship
been marooned here?

33:07.569 --> 33:10.038
Long enough for the Captain
to have run out of grog.

33:10.113 --> 33:13.208
I don't understand. If this is the
Captain, then what's the siren?

33:13.283 --> 33:14.660
Same as us.

33:15.243 --> 33:16.586
A stowaway.

33:16.661 --> 33:17.753
She killed it?

33:19.789 --> 33:21.006
Human bacteria.

33:21.291 --> 33:24.010
- What?
- A virus. From our planet.

33:24.085 --> 33:25.803
Airborne, travelling through the portal.

33:26.588 --> 33:29.182
That's what killed it.
Didn't get its jabs.

33:30.759 --> 33:33.103
- Ugh! Look.
- What is it?

33:33.178 --> 33:34.395
Sneeze!

33:34.971 --> 33:36.723
Alien bogies.

34:04.876 --> 34:07.345
- McGrath! He's one of my men.
- He's still breathing.

34:07.671 --> 34:09.344
My entire crew is here.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.679
- Toby!
- Rory!

34:11.757 --> 34:13.010
The Tardis!

34:15.512 --> 34:17.389
- We have to get him out of here.
- Wait!

34:19.014 --> 34:20.391
His fever's gone.

34:20.516 --> 34:21.518
Ah.

34:24.145 --> 34:26.614
- He looks so well.
- She's keeping him alive.

34:27.357 --> 34:31.533
His brain is still active but all
its cellular activity is suspended.

34:31.610 --> 34:34.659
It's not a curse, it's a tissue sample.

34:34.739 --> 34:36.741
Why get samples of people
you are about to kill?

34:36.824 --> 34:38.077
Help me get him up?

34:43.623 --> 34:45.091
She's coming.

35:09.065 --> 35:11.193
- Anaesthetic.
- What?

35:11.985 --> 35:14.033
Her music. The song.

35:14.904 --> 35:18.204
So she anaesthetises people
and then puts their body in stasis.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.462
Avery. No!

35:39.012 --> 35:41.231
Fire. That's new. Uh...

35:41.306 --> 35:44.651
What does fire do? Burn? Yes.
Destroy. What else?

35:45.185 --> 35:49.531
Sterilise!  I sneezed.
I brought germs in.

35:54.194 --> 35:56.117
Amy, stop. Don't interfere.
Don't touch him.

35:56.196 --> 35:59.040
Anaesthetic, tissue sample, screen,
sterile working conditions.

35:59.115 --> 36:00.162
Ignore all my previous theories!

36:00.241 --> 36:01.993
Yeah? Well, we stopped
paying attention a while back.

36:02.077 --> 36:04.125
She's not a killer at all.
She's a doctor!

36:09.501 --> 36:12.721
This is an automated sick bay.
It's teleporting everyone on board.

36:12.796 --> 36:15.219
The crew are dead and so the sick bay
has had nothing to do.

36:15.298 --> 36:17.596
It's been looking after humanity
whilst it's been idle.

36:18.385 --> 36:22.765
Look at her. A virtual doctor!
Able to sterilise a whole room.

36:22.847 --> 36:25.066
- Able to burn your face off.
- She's just an interface.

36:25.141 --> 36:27.143
Seeped through the join
between the planes.

36:27.227 --> 36:28.479
Broadcast in our world.

36:29.187 --> 36:32.361
Protean circuitry means
she can change her form.

36:32.440 --> 36:38.038
And become a human doctor for humans.
Oh, sister, you are good!

36:43.410 --> 36:44.627
She won't let us take them.

36:44.661 --> 36:46.834
She's keeping them alive but
she doesn't know how to heal them.

36:47.288 --> 36:49.541
I'm his wife, for God's sake!
Why can't I touch him?

36:51.501 --> 36:52.502
Tell her, Amy.

36:53.420 --> 36:54.421
Show her your ring.

36:54.504 --> 36:55.847
She may be virtual
but she's intelligent.

36:55.922 --> 36:58.345
You can't do anything
without her consent. Come on!

36:58.842 --> 36:59.843
Sophisticated girl like you,

36:59.926 --> 37:01.769
that must be somewhere
in your core program.

37:03.596 --> 37:06.440
Look. He's very ill, okay?
I just want to look after him.

37:09.018 --> 37:11.237
Why won't you let me near my husband?

37:22.490 --> 37:25.664
Consent form. Sign it.
Put your hand in the light.

37:25.702 --> 37:27.921
Rory's sick.
You have to take full responsibility.

37:41.092 --> 37:42.765
He can't breathe. Turn it back on.

37:46.514 --> 37:48.312
What do we do?
I can't just leave him here.

37:48.391 --> 37:49.643
He'll die if you take him out.

37:53.104 --> 37:54.321
Rory? Rory, wake up.

37:58.026 --> 37:59.778
- Where am I?
- You're in a hospital.

38:00.487 --> 38:01.989
If you leave, you might die.

38:03.448 --> 38:06.577
But if you don't,
you'll have to stay forever.

38:07.535 --> 38:09.629
You're saying
that if I don't get up now...

38:09.704 --> 38:10.921
You can never leave.

38:11.414 --> 38:14.839
- The siren will keep you safe.
- And if I come with you?

38:15.418 --> 38:17.420
Drowning, on the point of death.

38:20.340 --> 38:21.887
- I'm a nurse.
- What?

38:21.966 --> 38:24.185
- I can teach you how to save me.
- Whoa, hold on.

38:24.260 --> 38:25.887
I was drowning.
You just have to resuscitate me.

38:25.970 --> 38:27.062
"Just"?

38:27.138 --> 38:29.186
You've seen them do it loads of times
in films. CPR. The kiss of life.

38:29.265 --> 38:33.111
Rory, this isn't a film, okay?
What if I do it wrong?

38:33.186 --> 38:34.187
You won't.

38:35.271 --> 38:37.865
Okay. What if you don't
come back to life? What if...

38:37.941 --> 38:39.033
I trust you.

38:42.237 --> 38:46.162
What about him, hmm?
I mean, why do I have to be the one?

38:46.241 --> 38:48.585
Why do I have to save you?

38:49.452 --> 38:51.375
Because I know you'll never give up.

38:58.419 --> 39:00.672
We have to send this ship
back into space.

39:02.006 --> 39:04.475
I mean, imagine if the siren got ashore.

39:04.551 --> 39:06.178
She would have to process
every injured human.

39:07.512 --> 39:09.014
What about Toby?

39:11.349 --> 39:12.646
I'm sorry.

39:13.726 --> 39:17.151
Typhoid fever. Once he returns,
it's only a matter of time.

39:19.816 --> 39:24.413
What if I stay with him, here?
The siren will look after him.

39:26.489 --> 39:27.615
I can't go back to England.

39:28.700 --> 39:31.294
And what home does he have now,
if not with me?

39:34.539 --> 39:35.916
Do you think you can sail this thing?

39:38.251 --> 39:40.094
Just point me to the atom accelerator.

39:46.217 --> 39:48.436
I know you can do this.

39:50.096 --> 39:52.440
Of course, if you muck it up
I am going to be really cross.

39:52.515 --> 39:53.562
And dead.

39:57.020 --> 39:58.522
I'll see you in a minute.

40:25.548 --> 40:28.552
Come on. Come on, Row.
Not here. Not this way. Not today!

40:35.642 --> 40:37.895
He trusted me.
He trusted me to save him.

40:37.977 --> 40:41.231
You still can. You can still do this.
He believes in you. Come on, Amy!

40:42.482 --> 40:43.779
Come on!

40:58.122 --> 41:00.921
Please, please, please wake up.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.923
Please wake up.

41:03.002 --> 41:04.424
Wake up, wake up!

41:48.798 --> 41:49.799
Yes!

41:53.803 --> 41:54.895
Amy.

41:56.389 --> 41:58.107
Amy, you did it. You did it!

42:46.939 --> 42:49.658
I thought I was an excellent pirate.

42:49.734 --> 42:52.328
- I thought you were an excellent nurse.
- Easy, tiger.

42:53.321 --> 42:54.789
Goodnight, Doctor.

42:54.822 --> 42:56.199
Goodnight, Amelia.

42:57.325 --> 42:59.123
You only call me Amelia
when you're worrying about me.

43:00.119 --> 43:01.587
I always worry about you.

43:07.043 --> 43:08.340
Mutual.

43:10.338 --> 43:11.430
Go to bed, Pond.

43:15.635 --> 43:16.932
You can't tell him.

43:18.262 --> 43:19.730
It's his future.

43:24.143 --> 43:25.395
I know.

43:40.535 --> 43:42.128
Oh, Amelia.

43:45.873 --> 43:47.375
I've got mail.

43:47.500 --> 43:49.502
There's a living Time Lord
still out there.

43:51.045 --> 43:52.342
The house? What's the house?

43:52.421 --> 43:55.800
We walk on his back,
breathe his air, eat his food...

43:55.883 --> 43:57.385
And do my will.

43:57.468 --> 43:59.687
The little boxes will make you angry.

44:02.014 --> 44:03.061
I feel like a nine-year-old

44:03.141 --> 44:04.563
trying to rebuild a motorbike
in his bedroom.

44:04.642 --> 44:06.235
You are not my mother.

44:06.644 --> 44:08.612
Why shouldn't
I just kill you now?
