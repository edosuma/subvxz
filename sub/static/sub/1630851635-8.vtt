[tense music]

00:20.895 --> 00:27.819
* *

00:27.861 --> 00:29.362
- I'm sorry, I forgot
you're friends with them.

00:29.404 --> 00:31.322
- No, trust me,
I'd rather forget, too.

00:32.741 --> 00:35.702
Video games
used to be our thing.

00:35.744 --> 00:38.371
The one thing that
I wouldn't be able to take

00:38.413 --> 00:39.706
is you lying to me.

00:39.748 --> 00:41.499
Hey, babe.

00:41.541 --> 00:43.126
- Hey.
- Cooperstown.

00:43.168 --> 00:45.545
Would you--just
settle this for us, okay?

00:45.587 --> 00:47.172
Would you wear
a fucking mustache

00:47.213 --> 00:48.673
and a unibrow for Halloween?

00:48.715 --> 00:49.924
Would you do that?

00:49.966 --> 00:51.217
- You would only have
to wear the mustache.

00:51.259 --> 00:53.386
I'd be wearing the unibrow.
- Well--

00:53.428 --> 00:55.096
- We're gonna be Frida Kahlo
and Diego Rivera.

00:55.138 --> 00:56.598
They're an iconic duo.

00:56.639 --> 00:58.558
- Aren't you both a little
too white to pull that off?

00:58.600 --> 01:00.018
- See?
That's what I said.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.103
That's basically a de facto
vote for the magician

01:02.145 --> 01:04.356
and the bunny in the hat,
so we're good.

01:04.397 --> 01:07.776
- So couples costumes, huh?

01:07.817 --> 01:10.445
- Yeah.
- [chuckles]

01:11.780 --> 01:12.781
- Are you okay?

01:12.822 --> 01:14.157
I woke up this morning,

01:14.199 --> 01:15.450
you had just disappeared
without saying a word, so...

01:15.492 --> 01:16.951
- And late last night,

01:16.993 --> 01:19.245
you sent me that text message
that you deleted.

01:19.287 --> 01:20.455
What was that?

01:22.582 --> 01:24.292
- You okay?

01:24.334 --> 01:26.086
* *

01:26.127 --> 01:29.089
- It was just a funny meme
of a dog wearing a sweater

01:29.130 --> 01:30.757
speaking in a stupid voice.

01:30.799 --> 01:33.218
It's just me being silly.
- All right.

01:33.259 --> 01:35.470
Oh, I invited Keely
to the party, by the way.

01:35.512 --> 01:37.055
Maybe you can bring
your relationship back

01:37.097 --> 01:38.640
from the dead, and quick, man.

01:38.682 --> 01:41.142
'Cause people
are talking nonsense

01:41.184 --> 01:42.602
about your breakup and you.

01:42.644 --> 01:45.397
Just--just trust me, nonsense.

01:45.438 --> 01:46.773
Don't worry about it

01:46.815 --> 01:48.233
because people have
bigger things to worry about.

01:48.274 --> 01:51.736
Like, what the fuck
is he doing here?

01:51.778 --> 01:54.364
[upbeat music]

01:54.406 --> 01:55.699
- How did he...

01:55.740 --> 01:58.952
* *

01:58.993 --> 02:00.078
- * Adrenaline *

02:00.120 --> 02:04.916
* *

02:04.958 --> 02:08.128
* You're giving me
adrenaline *

02:08.169 --> 02:09.754
- Fucking Rojas.

02:09.796 --> 02:11.673
- Okay, I guess you want me
to apologize

02:11.715 --> 02:14.968
for getting you out of jail,
only I won't because--

02:15.010 --> 02:18.179
[phone buzzing]

02:20.140 --> 02:21.766
- Hey.

02:21.808 --> 02:24.269
Yeah, I'm at school.

02:24.310 --> 02:26.604
Can't you hear the hormones?

02:26.646 --> 02:29.482
Okay, bye.

02:29.524 --> 02:31.067
That was my parole officer.

02:31.109 --> 02:33.194
She calls twice a day
to make sure I'm either at home

02:33.236 --> 02:35.488
or here,
so basically I'm still in jail.

02:35.530 --> 02:37.073
- Seriously?
- Well, no.

02:37.115 --> 02:38.324
I mean, if I was still in jail,

02:38.366 --> 02:39.993
I wouldn't have to worry
about paying you back.

02:40.035 --> 02:41.661
Also, how do you think

02:41.703 --> 02:43.955
Yale likes students who bail
out murderers, Bronwyn?

02:43.997 --> 02:45.248
- Oh, I'm still going to Yale

02:45.290 --> 02:46.791
because we're going to prove
you're innocent.

02:46.833 --> 02:48.835
We will catch the asshole
who did this.

02:48.877 --> 02:50.170
- How?

02:50.211 --> 02:52.505
- [softly]
Simon didn't kill himself.

02:52.547 --> 02:56.551
My lawyer told me
how the cops know.

02:56.593 --> 02:58.595
He brought extra EpiPens
to the nurse's office

02:58.636 --> 03:01.806
on the first day of school...

03:01.848 --> 03:04.476
just a few hours
before he died.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.855
Same ones that showed up
later on your bike.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.690
- Why do that if you wanted
to end it all?

03:10.732 --> 03:12.817
- Exactly.
But he did set us up.

03:12.859 --> 03:14.277
He wanted us there.

03:14.319 --> 03:16.071
And I think he put the peanut
oil in the cup himself.

03:16.112 --> 03:17.530
[bell rings]

03:17.572 --> 03:19.282
- What, so you're saying
Simon wanted us

03:19.324 --> 03:20.867
to find the EpiPens
in the nurse's office,

03:20.909 --> 03:22.077
but something went wrong?

03:22.118 --> 03:23.787
- Nothing went wrong.
Somebody stole them.

03:23.828 --> 03:25.538
Somebody who knew
what was going to happen.

03:25.580 --> 03:27.123
Somebody who planted
the phone in my bag

03:27.165 --> 03:29.000
because Simon didn't get
close enough to me that day.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.294
Nate, he had an accomplice.

03:31.336 --> 03:33.922
Maybe the same person who's
been stalking us, framed you?

03:33.963 --> 03:36.424
- Did that asshole have any
other friends apart from Janae?

03:36.466 --> 03:37.842
- I have no idea,
but here's what I do know.

03:37.884 --> 03:39.552
Addy texted the group
last night.

03:39.594 --> 03:40.929
- Yeah, she deleted it.

03:40.970 --> 03:42.889
- I took a screen shot
right before she did.

03:42.931 --> 03:44.224
It was a picture.

03:44.265 --> 03:51.439
* *

04:00.156 --> 04:03.034
[soft music]

04:03.076 --> 04:04.828
- See you later.
- Yeah.

04:04.869 --> 04:11.418
* *

04:11.459 --> 04:14.004
- Hey. Addy.

04:14.045 --> 04:15.797
* *

04:15.839 --> 04:17.507
What is this?

04:17.549 --> 04:23.221
* *

04:23.263 --> 04:24.764
Were you with Jake last night?

04:24.806 --> 04:27.809
Is this his?
Was he friends with Simon?

04:27.851 --> 04:30.603
- You don't have to be friends
to kill aliens together, right?

04:30.645 --> 04:31.938
- Doesn't it seem
a bit weird to you?

04:31.980 --> 04:33.773
- I'm sure there's
an explanation.

04:33.815 --> 04:36.609
- Well, did you ask for one?
- It's not easy, okay?

04:36.651 --> 04:38.236
Pretty sure that confessing
to your boyfriend

04:38.278 --> 04:40.363
that you spied on his chat log
is not the best way to rebuild

04:40.405 --> 04:42.115
a healthy relationship,
you know?

04:42.157 --> 04:44.159
And I thought we were done
with all this Scooby-Doo shit.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.452
- Well, I'm not.

04:45.493 --> 04:46.786
Maybe you have the luxury

04:46.828 --> 04:48.246
of forgetting
about this whole thing

04:48.288 --> 04:50.248
so you can enjoy walks on
the beach with your boyfriend,

04:50.290 --> 04:53.293
but Nate is awaiting trial,
remember?

04:53.335 --> 04:56.212
- Yeah, I remember.

04:56.254 --> 04:57.630
I also remember what happens

04:57.672 --> 04:59.674
every time
we play detective, Bronwyn.

04:59.716 --> 05:03.386
TJ, Vanessa,
Ms. Avery got fired or worse.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.973
I'm not losing Jake, too.

05:07.015 --> 05:11.811
* *

05:11.853 --> 05:15.357
- And Addy has left
the group chat.

05:15.398 --> 05:17.150
Cooper just wants to move on.

05:17.192 --> 05:20.111
Oh, and I'm not sure if Nate
is ever going to forgive me

05:20.153 --> 05:21.404
for getting him out of jail.

05:21.446 --> 05:24.491
- Okay, breathe.

05:24.532 --> 05:29.037
I'm here.
And I'll always be here.

05:29.079 --> 05:30.830
Until I turn 18
and move to New York

05:30.872 --> 05:33.667
and none of you losers
ever see me again.

05:33.708 --> 05:35.669
And, hey, fuck Addy.
I mean, it's not personal.

05:35.710 --> 05:37.087
It's not like you hate Jake
or anything.

05:37.128 --> 05:39.631
- No, I mean,
I don't even know the guy.

05:39.673 --> 05:44.260
We only have this
one class to...

05:44.302 --> 05:45.553
- What?

05:45.595 --> 05:52.894
* *

05:53.395 --> 05:55.980
- Okay, so hear me out.

05:56.022 --> 05:59.109
I only have one class
with Jake, Ms. Avery's.

05:59.150 --> 06:01.361
Simon wasn't close enough
to me that day

06:01.403 --> 06:03.363
to plant the phone in my bag,

06:03.405 --> 06:05.657
but Jake...

06:05.699 --> 06:07.283
- What are you saying?

06:07.325 --> 06:10.036
- When your phone went missing
that day, was Jake around?

06:10.078 --> 06:12.288
- Jake's always around.
He's my friend.

06:12.330 --> 06:13.665
- And he's always around Addy.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.792
And she always
has her phone out.

06:15.834 --> 06:18.378
So he could've set that alarm
on her phone easy.

06:18.420 --> 06:20.505
* *

06:20.547 --> 06:22.048
- What about Nate?

06:22.090 --> 06:23.925
- Anybody could've jammed
my locker, Bronwyn.

06:23.967 --> 06:25.552
I'm sorry.
- Okay, but there's more.

06:25.593 --> 06:27.679
- Nate, wait up.
- Just drop it.

06:32.934 --> 06:34.144
- Oh, my God.

06:34.185 --> 06:35.937
- Okay, what the fuck?

06:35.979 --> 06:38.440
- Sorry, um--Nate.

06:38.481 --> 06:39.733
Do you know what's so weird

06:39.774 --> 06:41.901
about Simon and Jake
using the Xbox to chat?

06:41.943 --> 06:43.987
- I'm not sure why I'm finding
this kind of sexy.

06:44.029 --> 06:45.321
- Nate.

06:45.363 --> 06:47.991
What did Jake take
from Simon's room at the wake?

06:48.033 --> 06:50.744
His Xbox.

06:50.785 --> 06:52.620
What if they planned
this whole thing

06:52.662 --> 06:57.417
using the Xbox chat,
and Jake was taking evidence?

06:57.459 --> 06:59.294
- Don't give me hope, Rojas.

06:59.336 --> 07:01.546
- Okay, let's say that's true.

07:01.588 --> 07:04.299
He probably would've hammered
the thing to pieces by now.

07:04.341 --> 07:06.092
- I wouldn't.

07:06.134 --> 07:08.803
Because that would make me
look very suspicious.

07:08.845 --> 07:10.805
- I trust the criminal on this.

07:10.847 --> 07:12.349
- All right, look,
if he still has the Xbox,

07:12.390 --> 07:14.851
maybe we can get our hands
on it and look at the chats.

07:14.893 --> 07:18.521
- We don't have the password.

07:18.563 --> 07:21.191
- I don't have it.

07:21.232 --> 07:22.942
But I can guess it.

07:22.984 --> 07:25.278
And I guessed right
with "About That."

07:25.320 --> 07:26.780
Where's the Xbox?

07:26.821 --> 07:31.159
- In his bedroom
at his dad's house.

07:31.201 --> 07:33.661
- Is that where he's gonna
throw his Halloween party?

07:33.703 --> 07:38.083
* *

07:38.124 --> 07:40.794
So we could use the party
to get access to the Xbox

07:40.835 --> 07:42.962
and maybe see what
the chats were about, right?

07:43.004 --> 07:45.298
- Yeah.
- If you invite us.

07:45.340 --> 07:47.801
- [scoffs]

07:47.842 --> 07:50.762
Are you fucking kidding me?

07:50.804 --> 07:53.807
You guys seriously think
Jake has been stalking us?

07:53.848 --> 07:55.767
He's behind the creepy
Simon Says messages?

07:55.809 --> 07:57.435
- Well, remember
what Janae said.

07:57.477 --> 08:00.188
Simon hated Cooper, Nate,
and me, but he didn't hate you.

08:00.230 --> 08:02.315
So whoever was working with him
brought you into the fold.

08:02.357 --> 08:03.566
He hated you.

08:03.608 --> 08:05.485
- What if he hated you so much,

08:05.527 --> 08:06.986
he tried to frame you
with the EpiPen?

08:07.028 --> 08:09.531
And when that didn't work,
he used it as a distraction

08:09.572 --> 08:11.157
to frame
the most likely suspect.

08:11.199 --> 08:13.410
No offense.
- I've been called worse.

08:13.451 --> 08:16.579
- Why would Jake hate me before
he even found out about TJ?

08:18.373 --> 08:20.709
- What if he knew before that?

08:20.750 --> 08:24.713
- Wait, so you're not only
calling him a murderer,

08:24.754 --> 08:27.173
but also a total
fucking psychopath

08:27.215 --> 08:29.092
who knew about my secret
all along and pretended

08:29.134 --> 08:32.095
and he didn't for, like,
what, weeks?

08:32.137 --> 08:34.639
For what?
- Addy, I really don't know.

08:34.681 --> 08:36.516
But clearly you also
had some questions

08:36.558 --> 08:37.934
if you sent us that pic,
deleted it,

08:37.976 --> 08:39.936
and then lied about it.

08:39.978 --> 08:43.189
Look, if there's nothing
on the Xbox, at least we know.

08:43.231 --> 08:45.191
We did do the same thing
with TJ at homecoming,

08:45.233 --> 08:46.401
and that was your idea.

08:46.443 --> 08:48.778
- Look at how that ended up.

08:48.820 --> 08:50.739
This is insane.

08:50.780 --> 08:52.741
It's Jake.
And he's waiting for me.

08:52.782 --> 08:55.618
- Addy, Addy.

08:55.660 --> 08:58.538
Addy, Jake is
a controlling sociopath!

08:58.580 --> 09:00.707
I mean, can't you see--

09:00.749 --> 09:02.876
look at the way
this man manipulates you.

09:02.917 --> 09:05.879
He chooses the fucking flavor
of your pancakes

09:05.920 --> 09:07.464
that you don't even like, okay?

09:07.505 --> 09:11.176
Addy, he doesn't love you.
He loves having a puppet.

09:11.217 --> 09:13.553
That's what Simon was to him
before Simon saw him

09:13.595 --> 09:16.514
for who he really is--

09:16.556 --> 09:19.434
until he didn't, I guess.

09:19.476 --> 09:20.727
[door opens]

09:20.769 --> 09:23.730
* *

09:23.772 --> 09:27.108
- What the fuck
is going on here?

09:27.150 --> 09:29.861
- Study group.

09:29.903 --> 09:33.740
- What are you doing
to my girlfriend?

09:33.782 --> 09:36.785
- Why were you talking
to Simon on Xbox?

09:38.119 --> 09:40.413
Addy told us you saw
the whole chat history

09:40.455 --> 09:42.832
with Anarchi$K.

09:42.874 --> 09:45.085
- You think that was Simon?

09:45.126 --> 09:48.088
No, no, no, that was just
some random "Fortnite" kid.

09:48.129 --> 09:51.591
I mean, unless...

09:51.633 --> 09:53.677
Was I being catfished by Simon?

09:53.718 --> 09:55.929
It was some weirdo who was just
asking me a bunch of questions

09:55.970 --> 09:57.430
about people that he knew
at school.

09:57.472 --> 09:59.099
I mean, was he looking for dirt
or something?

09:59.140 --> 10:00.850
I--well,
I didn't give him anything,

10:00.892 --> 10:01.935
if that's what you guys
are thinking.

10:01.976 --> 10:03.395
- Simon would never do that.

10:03.436 --> 10:06.022
- Right, destroying
people's lives is just fine,

10:06.064 --> 10:08.316
but of course he draws the line
at catfishing.

10:08.358 --> 10:11.277
Come on, I mean...

10:11.319 --> 10:12.987
Wait, what exactly
am I being accused of here?

10:13.029 --> 10:14.489
- I think you know
what the fuck we're--

10:14.531 --> 10:16.991
- Nothing!

10:17.033 --> 10:19.494
We were just looking
into Simon and then--

10:19.536 --> 10:21.705
- Now you're looking into me.

10:21.746 --> 10:23.665
- No.

10:25.166 --> 10:26.376
- Really?

10:29.045 --> 10:30.964
Babe...

10:31.006 --> 10:32.799
- [whimpers]
- No.

10:35.093 --> 10:37.470
- [sighs]

10:37.512 --> 10:39.556
Jake!

10:39.597 --> 10:41.307
Jake, come on.
Jake!

10:41.349 --> 10:44.185
- Stop, stop, I told myself
that if this was gonna work,

10:44.227 --> 10:46.146
I was gonna have to learn
how to trust you again.

10:46.187 --> 10:47.772
And then I--

10:47.814 --> 10:50.400
and then I find out that you--

10:50.442 --> 10:51.818
you been spying on me, Addy?

10:51.860 --> 10:53.737
- No, it wasn't like that.

10:53.778 --> 10:56.281
Jake, I just saw it by accident
and, yeah,

10:56.322 --> 10:58.158
I thought it was weird,
but then you explained it all

10:58.199 --> 11:00.869
and it makes sense that Simon
was a total creep and did that.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.829
- Look, it's either me
or the people

11:02.871 --> 11:06.499
that have been
filling your head with shit.

11:06.541 --> 11:09.294
It's your choice.

11:30.231 --> 11:31.608
- [sighs]

11:31.649 --> 11:34.194
- So first you crash my party,

11:34.235 --> 11:36.196
and then you badger
my girlfriend.

11:36.237 --> 11:39.074
- We were just chatting
about you

11:39.115 --> 11:41.117
and how you are definitely not

11:41.159 --> 11:43.453
a total and complete
piece of shit.

11:43.495 --> 11:45.580
- [chuckles]

11:45.622 --> 11:48.375
Oh, yeah, we've gotten funnier
with the years, freak.

11:48.416 --> 11:51.503
I'll tell you that much.
- You have.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.880
Especially when you try
and act tough.

11:53.922 --> 11:58.426
* *

11:58.468 --> 12:00.428
- So what'd you say to her?

12:00.470 --> 12:03.848
* *

12:03.890 --> 12:05.350
- Dumbass.

12:05.392 --> 12:09.062
[tense music]

12:09.104 --> 12:11.898
What the fuck?
- Tell me right now.

12:11.940 --> 12:13.358
What'd you say to her?
- Jake, what are you--

12:13.400 --> 12:15.443
- Hey, aren't you friends
with that Janae chick?

12:15.485 --> 12:19.531
She's, like, totally fucked up.
You should probably come help.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.866
- Yeah.

12:21.908 --> 12:24.202
Yeah, yeah.
Jake, Jake.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.079
- What's up with the smirk?
- Jake, get off.

12:26.121 --> 12:27.205
- Man, I want to know.
I think you should tell me why.

12:27.247 --> 12:28.206
- Jake, Jake!
- I said why?

12:28.248 --> 12:29.833
- She's cheating on you,
genius.

12:29.874 --> 12:34.004

Look, man,
you know I don't lie.

12:36.756 --> 12:43.847

12:50.270 --> 12:53.523
- Hey, babe, I heard shouting.
Are you okay?

12:53.565 --> 12:58.028
* *

12:58.069 --> 12:59.612
- Yeah, I'm fine, babe.

12:59.654 --> 13:00.822
- What's up?

13:00.864 --> 13:03.783
- Come here, come here.

13:03.825 --> 13:07.370
- Mm, don't leave me out there.

13:07.412 --> 13:14.336

13:21.176 --> 13:23.803
- I don't believe him.

13:23.845 --> 13:25.764
Do you?

13:25.805 --> 13:29.559
* *

13:29.601 --> 13:31.353
- Well, all right.

13:31.394 --> 13:35.357
If we want to crash this party,
we're gonna need costumes.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.281
- [grunts]
All right.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.825
- Thanks so much
for helping us so quickly.

13:45.867 --> 13:47.369
- Okay, so we need
to find something

13:47.410 --> 13:48.745
to cover our faces, right?

13:48.787 --> 13:51.081
And when we get there,
you guys are too famous

13:51.122 --> 13:52.874
to be taking off your masks
then saying shit.

13:52.916 --> 13:55.293
- Okay, so y'all are trying
to be Ocean's Eleven

13:55.335 --> 13:57.462
on a killer on Halloween?

13:57.504 --> 13:58.797
It's cute.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.799
If it was a movie,
I'd watch the shit out of it,

14:00.840 --> 14:02.967
but this is not a movie, y'all.

14:03.009 --> 14:05.720
This is real life,
real consequences.

14:05.762 --> 14:07.639
Sounds crazy what y'all
trying to do.

14:07.681 --> 14:09.265
- It's insane, actually.

14:09.307 --> 14:11.267
- Yeah, but this could be
our only chance.

14:11.309 --> 14:12.936
He knows we're onto him,
and he's not gonna

14:12.977 --> 14:14.771
hold onto that Xbox forever.

14:14.813 --> 14:16.815
We need you 'cause
we can't just sneak in

14:16.856 --> 14:19.150
through the front door,
but you've got an invitation.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.152
- Okay, but what if Jake
clocks me?

14:21.194 --> 14:23.363
I mean, he's not exactly
a big fan of me right now.

14:23.405 --> 14:24.948
- Use your Southern charm.

14:24.989 --> 14:26.282
- Right, so we're fucked.

14:26.324 --> 14:27.450
- Do you want Nate
to go back to jail?

14:27.492 --> 14:30.161
- I don't care about Nate.
No offense.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.621
- I'm starting to get
a little offended.

14:31.663 --> 14:35.125
- I'm doing this for Simon.
What about Addy?

14:35.166 --> 14:36.626
I mean, what if she's going

14:36.668 --> 14:38.586
to bed every night
with a fucking psycho?

14:38.628 --> 14:40.547
- Well, then,
I can't win in this shit.

14:40.588 --> 14:42.132
It's like either
my best friend is guilty,

14:42.173 --> 14:43.758
or he'll probably figure out
what I've done,

14:43.800 --> 14:45.468
and I'll lose him too.

14:45.510 --> 14:47.971
I don't have that many people.

14:48.013 --> 14:50.098

14:54.686 --> 14:57.939
Unless you, like, fuck it up.
Then you're on your own, champ.

15:23.089 --> 15:26.718
- What the fuck do you want?

15:26.760 --> 15:29.304
- I want you to write
a post about Addy.

15:29.346 --> 15:33.433
I want her to suffer.
I want her to sweat.

15:35.185 --> 15:37.645
- Have you thought about,

15:37.687 --> 15:40.982
I don't know,
breaking up with her?

15:41.024 --> 15:42.233
- No, she knows
that the one thing

15:42.275 --> 15:44.527
that I can't stand
is a cheater.

15:44.569 --> 15:46.946
She knows how my dad
ruined my mom's life,

15:46.988 --> 15:49.532
how it completely fucked us,
and she still just went

15:49.574 --> 15:53.286
right ahead
and fucking took me for a fool.

15:53.328 --> 15:55.163

15:55.205 --> 15:57.832
You cross me,
I'm gonna teach you a lesson.

15:57.874 --> 15:59.626
- Well, why would I help you?

15:59.668 --> 16:01.961
- I mean, you remember the days
when we would just daydream

16:02.003 --> 16:04.381
on all the ways we'd get back
at the high school,

16:04.422 --> 16:05.882
you know, jocks and posers.

16:05.924 --> 16:09.678
- I also remember the summer
you got a gym membership,

16:09.719 --> 16:11.262
grew abs for brains,

16:11.304 --> 16:13.598
started hanging out
with some jocks.

16:13.640 --> 16:17.060
And I remember deservedly
making fun of you for it.

16:17.102 --> 16:19.646
[chuckles]

16:19.688 --> 16:22.190
And then you never
spoke to me again.

16:22.232 --> 16:25.193
I either prayed
at the altar of Jake,

16:25.235 --> 16:28.822
or I didn't exist.

16:28.863 --> 16:30.740
Well, I did,

16:30.782 --> 16:35.036
but only to be made fun of by
you and your new jock buddies.

16:35.078 --> 16:38.581
* *

16:38.623 --> 16:41.459
You're the biggest fake I know.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.003
- I'm not you, Simon.

16:43.044 --> 16:45.088
I'm not...

16:45.130 --> 16:47.841
I'm not strong enough
to be different.

16:47.882 --> 16:50.593
- Well, that's why
we're not friends anymore.

16:50.635 --> 16:52.387

16:52.429 --> 16:54.389
You're gonna have to find
someone else to help

16:54.431 --> 16:56.683
with your little revenge plot.

17:04.691 --> 17:08.653

How about this?

17:12.449 --> 17:15.118
What if I dare you?

17:15.160 --> 17:16.911
- We're not 12.
- [laughs]

17:16.953 --> 17:18.621
- And I remember
how much trouble we got in

17:18.663 --> 17:20.373
when you used the magic words.

17:20.415 --> 17:23.501
- Oh, come on, man,
it was a blast and you know it.

17:23.543 --> 17:26.629
That one time we changed
every desktop wallpaper

17:26.671 --> 17:30.592
in the library to pictures
of--what was it?

17:30.633 --> 17:32.093
- Hemorrhoids.
- Hemorrhoids.

17:32.135 --> 17:33.887
- It was assholes
for the assholes.

17:33.928 --> 17:34.971
- [laughs]

17:35.013 --> 17:36.139
- You remember the time
you dared me

17:36.181 --> 17:39.392
to take peanut oil
in gym class?

17:39.434 --> 17:41.311
Make it look like
a jock poisoned me?

17:41.353 --> 17:43.313
- Too bad you chickened out.
- Yeah, well,

17:43.355 --> 17:45.607
it wouldn't have worked anyway.

17:45.648 --> 17:49.361
Poisoning is far
too sophisticated

17:49.402 --> 17:51.946
for those idiots.

17:51.988 --> 17:54.699
- Maybe that idea was just
too ahead of its time.

17:56.451 --> 17:57.660
I mean, think about it,
nobody would've believed

17:57.702 --> 17:59.204
that they wanted
to kill you back then.

17:59.245 --> 18:04.084
But now?

Simon.

18:15.553 --> 18:18.306
I'm sure there's a few
that you hate right back.

18:18.348 --> 18:20.558
I've certainly got a candidate
on my list.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.228
- Yeah, after your party,
I can think of a few.

18:23.269 --> 18:27.524
But...we're not 12.

18:27.565 --> 18:29.901
- Exactly.
Now we're old enough.

18:29.943 --> 18:34.197
We're smart enough
to do it right.

- Yeah.

19:47.562 --> 19:49.481
It's okay.
I like riding my bike.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.066
- Yeah, but people see you
on that thing,

19:51.107 --> 19:52.442
they're going to think
that I'm an asshole

19:52.484 --> 19:54.027
for not giving you
a ride, Addy.

19:54.069 --> 19:57.197
- [chuckles]
Anyways, you look amazing.

19:57.238 --> 19:59.115
- Mm.
- And I was thinking,

19:59.157 --> 20:00.742
what if we both look amazing?

20:00.784 --> 20:04.037
What if we both dress
as magicians?

20:04.079 --> 20:05.914
- [laughs]
What?

20:05.955 --> 20:07.791
- Yeah, I brought
my own costume.

20:07.832 --> 20:11.086
We could be like Houdini
and Ms. Houdini.

20:11.127 --> 20:13.630
- Addy, we're going to look
like a couple of penguins.

20:13.672 --> 20:15.090
- But a bunny costume--

20:15.131 --> 20:17.217
- Yeah, a very,
very cute and sexy bunny.

20:17.258 --> 20:19.302
Look, I just wanted
our first party back together

20:19.344 --> 20:20.303
to be picture perfect.

20:20.345 --> 20:22.055
Is that too much to ask?

20:26.434 --> 20:28.311
Okay, look, if you'd
rather us do your thing,

20:28.353 --> 20:31.147
I guess that's cool, too.

"Mother Vanessa."

21:38.423 --> 21:40.008
You are excommunicated.

that bitch back?

21:53.563 --> 21:55.065
I will be grounded

21:55.106 --> 21:57.233
once my parents get back
from Puerto Vallarta.

21:57.275 --> 21:59.319
- You want me to talk to 'em?

21:59.361 --> 22:01.029
Parents love me.
You know this.

22:01.071 --> 22:03.990
- Yes, text my mom.

22:04.032 --> 22:06.034
- You're welcome.

22:06.076 --> 22:09.412
* *

22:09.454 --> 22:12.916
Hi, welcome.
Who are you?

22:12.957 --> 22:15.001
Hope you're not
who I think you are.

22:15.043 --> 22:21.966
* *

22:23.593 --> 22:25.553
You know what?
Actually, you're not welcome.

22:25.595 --> 22:27.597
Don't make throw you out, man.

22:27.639 --> 22:29.808
- I was just
playing along, bro.

22:29.849 --> 22:34.521
That chick Bronwyn?
She scares me sometimes.

22:34.562 --> 22:36.314
Jake, you were right
all along, okay?

22:36.356 --> 22:39.109
I shouldn't have touched them
with a 10-foot pole.

22:40.652 --> 22:44.531
- It's too late, Coop.

22:44.572 --> 22:46.491
Bro, I don't even know
who you are anymore.

22:48.493 --> 22:49.828
All right, come on, let's go--

22:49.869 --> 22:52.539
- Jake, Jake,
you want to know who I am?

22:52.580 --> 22:55.959
I'm gay, okay?

22:56.001 --> 22:57.877
That crazy rumor
that you may have heard

22:57.919 --> 23:00.630
that you couldn't
quite believe,

23:00.672 --> 23:02.674
it's true.

23:02.716 --> 23:06.219
That's why
I've been so distant lately.

23:06.261 --> 23:08.304
I know how you'd react.

23:08.346 --> 23:10.181
* *

23:10.223 --> 23:12.976
Do you know how hard
it's been for me not being able

23:13.018 --> 23:15.311
to talk to my best friend
about any of this?

23:15.353 --> 23:22.318
* *

23:22.360 --> 23:24.487
- Need a drink?

23:24.529 --> 23:26.948
* *

23:26.990 --> 23:31.703
- For you,
I'll make an exception.

23:31.745 --> 23:33.329
Double whiskey soda?

23:33.371 --> 23:35.373
- You know me so well.

23:35.415 --> 23:37.125
- All right.

23:37.167 --> 23:39.586
- We already talked about this.
No, stop, Zach.

23:39.627 --> 23:42.714
Seriously, get off of me!

23:42.756 --> 23:45.508
- Keely, that's Zach?

23:45.550 --> 23:47.635
But why is your ex here?

23:47.677 --> 23:49.095
Hey, hey, are you okay?

23:49.137 --> 23:51.389
- Not your problem anymore,
Cooper.

23:51.431 --> 23:53.183
I can take care of myself.

23:53.224 --> 23:55.185
- Keely.

23:55.226 --> 24:02.192
* *

24:31.471 --> 24:33.139
- Hey, man.

24:33.181 --> 24:36.434
* *

24:36.476 --> 24:39.437
Look, I appreciate you
being honest with me.

24:39.479 --> 24:41.398
* *

24:41.439 --> 24:43.274
I'm glad you came.

24:43.316 --> 24:45.694
- Yeah, me too.
How about that drink?

24:45.735 --> 24:48.655
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

24:48.697 --> 24:55.787
* *

25:02.127 --> 25:04.546
- I think Cooper said
that was his room.

25:04.587 --> 25:08.008
* *

25:08.049 --> 25:09.759
- We got so lucky
he didn't see us.

25:09.801 --> 25:11.261
- You did not need
to come here.

25:11.302 --> 25:13.471
- Stop trying to protect me.
- Stop trying to save me.

25:13.513 --> 25:15.682
Why are you risking your
fucking future for me, Bronwyn?

25:15.724 --> 25:17.934
- Because.

25:17.976 --> 25:20.270
I want to be with you.

25:20.311 --> 25:23.815
Not just because we're thrown
into this weird situation

25:23.857 --> 25:25.817
together,
and I think you're hot,

25:25.859 --> 25:29.279
although I do,
but you're also smart,

25:29.320 --> 25:31.197
and you're funny,
and you do the right thing

25:31.239 --> 25:32.824
more often than you
give yourself credit for.

25:32.866 --> 25:36.953
And I like that you never
sugarcoat anything,

25:36.995 --> 25:38.705
and your horrible taste
in movies,

25:38.747 --> 25:41.833
and the fact that you have
an actual lizard.

25:41.875 --> 25:43.668
And I can't go more
than a few minutes

25:43.710 --> 25:47.464
without wanting to kiss you,
so...

25:47.505 --> 25:49.924
there's that.

25:51.634 --> 25:55.555
- It was more of a
rhetorical question, you know?

26:12.072 --> 26:14.282
- Oh, what, you are fresh
out of prison, huh?

26:14.324 --> 26:15.700
There's no fucking Xbox
in there.

26:15.742 --> 26:16.993
I looked everywhere,
drawers, everything.

26:17.035 --> 26:18.203
There's nothing.
- Are you sure?

26:18.244 --> 26:19.412
- Yeah.

26:19.454 --> 26:21.164
- Well, we just gotta
keep looking.

26:21.206 --> 26:24.042
If I were him, I would put
the thing under lock and key.

26:24.084 --> 26:25.543
- Okay, great,
I'll go look downstairs,

26:25.585 --> 26:27.504
and you guys keep looking
in each other's mouths.

26:27.545 --> 26:28.922

26:28.963 --> 26:30.799
- Let's--let's go this way.

26:33.468 --> 26:36.513
- Are you still on that
zero sugar diet or what?

26:36.554 --> 26:39.224
- This is a whole lot of sugar.
- [laughs]

26:39.265 --> 26:44.521

26:44.562 --> 26:47.399
Hey, just want to say,

26:47.440 --> 26:49.526
it's really good to be back
at one of your parties.

26:49.567 --> 26:50.860
I needed this.

26:50.902 --> 26:52.779
- Yeah, me too.

26:52.821 --> 26:56.783
* *

26:56.825 --> 26:59.619
Look, man, if I were you,

26:59.661 --> 27:02.789
I'd talk to Bronwyn.

27:02.831 --> 27:04.332
If she keeps hanging out
with these people,

27:04.374 --> 27:07.085
she's gonna be giving
her graduation speech

27:07.127 --> 27:09.879
in handcuffs, you know?

27:09.921 --> 27:11.715
Tell her to let the criminal
take the fall,

27:11.756 --> 27:14.551
stop playing detective, she--

27:14.592 --> 27:16.386

You're just looking out
for her, you know?

27:18.930 --> 27:21.641

27:21.683 --> 27:25.270
- Right, right, yeah.

27:25.311 --> 27:28.606
Like you've been looking out
for me since all this started.

27:28.648 --> 27:30.400

27:30.442 --> 27:31.901
- Yeah.

27:31.943 --> 27:35.864

27:39.909 --> 27:41.786
- What about Cooper?

27:41.828 --> 27:44.706
- Eh, whatever, man.

27:44.748 --> 27:47.751
Maybe the superstar
needs to be brought down a peg.

27:47.792 --> 27:50.378
- They all do.

27:50.420 --> 27:52.422
- Man, I can't wait
to see their faces.

be there, right?

28:00.472 --> 28:01.806
- What?

28:01.848 --> 28:06.770
- Well, outside detention
just in case?

You know,
I don't trust those idiots

28:08.146 --> 28:09.606
to know their way
around an EpiPen.

28:09.647 --> 28:12.275
- No, no, Simon.

28:13.735 --> 28:16.404
I told you, nothing to tie me
to any of this.

Yeah, recommended by

Not really my scene.

time lose the fucking attitude

we could do my idea.

gotten the idea

humiliate me in public?

at batting practice.

the good news first
or the bad news?

- Whatever's faster.

feeling but it was worth it...

Get out.

- Well, that's just
fucking awesome.

34:53.551 --> 34:56.012
- Babe.
Babe, I'm so sorry.

34:56.054 --> 34:58.973
I'm done with those losers.
I swear.

34:59.015 --> 35:02.310
- It's okay.
You don't have to listen to me.

35:02.352 --> 35:03.853
- I want to.

35:03.895 --> 35:06.523
The bunny costume
is much cuter.

35:06.564 --> 35:10.026
I'll go change.

- I think you may need this.

35:42.892 --> 35:44.978
- How did you even find it?

35:45.020 --> 35:46.604
- Magic,

35:46.646 --> 35:49.399
which is funny because I think
I was under a magician's spell.

35:49.441 --> 35:53.153
Now it's broken
because of pancakes.

35:53.194 --> 35:54.654
- Well, welcome back.

35:54.696 --> 35:57.532
And I promise we're not
gonna screw this one up.

35:57.574 --> 36:00.869
- Here you go.

[laughs]

36:41.201 --> 36:48.166

36:50.710 --> 36:52.337

- No, you didn't.

Jake, what are you--
- Shut up, shut up.

Coop, shut the fuck up.

37:08.395 --> 37:10.730
You don't think I will?

are going to believe, huh?

Me or Murder Club?

I know how to use this.

- Yeah.

40:22.047 --> 40:25.884
Yeah, Jake, I know.

40:25.925 --> 40:30.430
You always wanted to teach me.
I never wanted to learn.

40:30.472 --> 40:31.806
I hate guns.

40:31.848 --> 40:34.184
I just never wanted to tell you

'cause I always so afraid
of upsetting you.

Not anymore.

Everything.

be alive right now

loyal to me.

I loved you, Addy.

and now?

break us apart, man.

So we wouldn't find out what
you had done to us,

[somber music]

41:58.393 --> 42:00.729
- It's nothing
against you, man.

42:00.770 --> 42:03.023
I just wanted to get rid
of the fucking genius

42:03.064 --> 42:04.482
who really believed
he could play me...

42:06.609 --> 42:09.320
I'm sorry.
My fingers.

42:09.362 --> 42:14.868
And frame my lying,
cheating girlfriend.

42:14.909 --> 42:17.620
* *

42:17.662 --> 42:18.955
It's a shame
that nobody thought

42:18.997 --> 42:20.290
that she was smart enough
to come up

42:20.331 --> 42:22.000
with a plan
half as good as mine.

42:22.042 --> 42:24.919
* *

42:24.961 --> 42:26.963
So I had to go with plan B:

42:27.005 --> 42:29.132
frame the most
obvious suspect.

42:29.174 --> 42:31.551
You just couldn't let go,
could you, huh?

42:31.593 --> 42:33.303
Could you?
- Jake.

42:35.180 --> 42:36.806
- Well, now you will.

42:36.848 --> 42:39.851

42:39.893 --> 42:43.480
Give me the Xbox, babe.

42:56.701 --> 42:59.162
- Okay.

We'll do whatever
you want us to do.

Oh.

Oh...

[groans]

44:16.239 --> 44:19.409
It'll dissolve as soon
as you put it in water.

44:19.451 --> 44:21.911
- How the fuck do I let you
talk me into this?

44:21.953 --> 44:23.413
- Are you bitching out again?

44:23.455 --> 44:26.875
- Everything I've done
to expose the liars and fakes,

44:26.916 --> 44:30.003
and now I'm about to fake
my own assassination attempt

44:30.045 --> 44:31.421
after blackmailing

44:31.463 --> 44:35.300
the only teacher I like
in this damn place.

44:35.342 --> 44:38.011
- Well, you could always
just go home,

44:38.053 --> 44:41.806
back to your
boring fucking life,

44:41.848 --> 44:43.308
wondering
what if you had the guts

44:43.350 --> 44:45.769
to actually go through with it.

44:45.810 --> 44:47.937
* *

44:47.979 --> 44:52.609
I dare you...

44:52.650 --> 44:55.487
for the last time.

44:55.528 --> 45:02.494
* *

45:17.175 --> 45:19.928
- I'll see you
on the other side.

45:19.969 --> 45:21.471
- Simon?

45:21.513 --> 45:23.431
- What, dumbass?

45:27.686 --> 45:29.312
- [chuckles]

45:30.855 --> 45:33.566
[zipper closes]
See you on the other side.

45:33.608 --> 45:40.073
* *

45:55.046 --> 45:57.841
- [sobbing]
Jake.

45:57.882 --> 46:00.010
Jake, no.

46:00.051 --> 46:02.220
No.

46:02.262 --> 46:07.017
* *

46:07.058 --> 46:09.811
- It's okay.
It's okay.

46:13.189 --> 46:15.859
- What now?

46:15.900 --> 46:22.741
* *

46:28.329 --> 46:29.622
- It's all bullshit, guys.

46:29.664 --> 46:30.874
Okay.

46:30.915 --> 46:33.251
So here's what the police
want us to believe.

46:33.293 --> 46:36.588
They want us to believe that
during Jake's Halloween party,

46:36.629 --> 46:39.132
he just decides to run away.

46:39.174 --> 46:40.508
Why?

46:40.550 --> 46:43.386
Because his girlfriend,
the liar-in-chief,

46:43.428 --> 46:46.973
said that she saw Simon's user
name on his Xbox or something,

46:47.015 --> 46:48.725
and when she confronted him
about it,

46:48.767 --> 46:51.686
he got all upset and nervous.

46:51.728 --> 46:54.689
- He seemed really upset
and nervous.

46:54.731 --> 46:56.024
I don't know why.

46:56.066 --> 46:57.317
- I mean, come on.

46:57.359 --> 46:58.985
He was totally fine
when I saw him.

46:59.027 --> 47:01.029
And then--okay,

47:01.071 --> 47:03.782
so I really wish I remembered
the rest of the night.

47:03.823 --> 47:05.575
That last strawberry daquiri
will always be one

47:05.617 --> 47:08.161
of the biggest regrets
of my life.

47:08.203 --> 47:10.580
- You talk to him again?

47:10.622 --> 47:12.123
- That was the last time
I saw him.

47:12.165 --> 47:16.086
- So, yeah, he takes his car
and his phone

47:16.127 --> 47:21.007
and just disappears
dressed as a fucking magician.

47:21.049 --> 47:22.967
- So were you at Jake's party?

47:23.009 --> 47:25.845
- I was at home that night.
Where else would I have been?

47:25.887 --> 47:27.430
- The police
are even considering

47:27.472 --> 47:29.432
dropping the charges
against Nate

47:29.474 --> 47:33.395
because conveniently enough,
Jake left Simon's Xbox

47:33.436 --> 47:34.979
in his room
for the police to find.

47:35.021 --> 47:38.066
- I didn't even know that Jake
was into video games.

47:38.108 --> 47:39.359
But if there's something
in there,

47:39.401 --> 47:40.694
you guys can find it, right?

47:40.735 --> 47:43.863
- The police get access,
and of course there are

47:43.905 --> 47:47.409
the chats Simon recorded,
basically a full confession.

47:47.450 --> 47:51.538
Smells like a setup to me--
a Murder Club setup.

47:51.579 --> 47:53.289
- This is all news to me.

47:53.331 --> 47:55.959
- Just like that,
everyone has just gone back

47:56.001 --> 47:57.544
to their lives
like nothing happened.

47:57.585 --> 47:59.921
- Can I go back to class now?

47:59.963 --> 48:01.214
- Have a good day.

48:01.256 --> 48:03.967
- Jake is not a murderer.

48:04.009 --> 48:07.095
And he most definitely
is not a quitter.

48:07.137 --> 48:10.098
He would've never fled
to Mexico without telling me.

48:10.140 --> 48:12.267
There are so many holes
in the official truth

48:12.308 --> 48:13.643
that the mainstream media
are trying

48:13.685 --> 48:15.311
to shove down our throats.

48:15.353 --> 48:18.773
But we are not sheep.
We are an army.

48:18.815 --> 48:23.611
Because we just surpassed
20,000 followers.

48:23.653 --> 48:25.071
And it's just the beginning.

48:25.113 --> 48:27.073
So please make sure
to tell everyone you know

48:27.115 --> 48:30.744
to click the link in my bio,
follow, and share.

48:42.464 --> 48:44.341
- I called you
on the burner phone yesterday.

48:44.382 --> 48:47.385
It said the number
didn't exist.

48:47.427 --> 48:49.346
- You said we'd go
back to normal.

48:49.387 --> 48:52.766
[soft music]

48:52.807 --> 48:56.269
We are not each other's normal.

* Oh, la, la, la, la *

49:23.046 --> 49:26.800
* Welcome to my darkness,

49:26.841 --> 49:30.011

hurting for a smile *

49:30.053 --> 49:32.681
* Or something *

49:32.722 --> 49:37.394
* But something always turns
into nothing *

49:37.435 --> 49:39.479
* Oh, I'll drain your life *

49:39.521 --> 49:43.858
* Till there's nothing left
but your bloodshot eyes *

49:43.900 --> 49:45.944
* Oh, I'll take my time *

49:45.985 --> 49:48.321
- You ever gonna tell me
what happened with Murder Club?

49:48.363 --> 49:51.074
- * I feel inside *

49:51.116 --> 49:52.659
- Don't call us that.
