11:41.200 --> 11:42.301
- Whoo.
- Thank you very much.

11:42.334 --> 11:43.302
[applause]

11:43.335 --> 11:46.138
Thank you for coming.

11:46.172 --> 11:49.375
For this experience, we're
going to use a deck of cards.

11:49.408 --> 11:51.944
But, um, I have a plan.

11:51.977 --> 11:53.546
I'm not going
to try to fool you.

11:53.579 --> 11:54.814
- Good.

11:54.847 --> 11:56.515
- Alyson is going to do it.
- Oh, good.

11:56.549 --> 11:59.552
- So, if she does--
if she does fool you,

11:59.585 --> 12:01.620
it's our success.
- Yes.

12:01.654 --> 12:03.756
- If she doesn't,
it's her fault.

12:03.789 --> 12:04.990
[laughter]
Yes, okay.

12:05.024 --> 12:06.258
It's okay.

12:06.292 --> 12:09.228
So we are going to do
an intuition test.

12:09.261 --> 12:10.796
In this way.

12:10.830 --> 12:12.631
We are going through
an elimination process.

12:12.665 --> 12:14.233
So we are going
to eliminate cards

12:14.266 --> 12:16.469
until we only
have four cards, okay?

12:16.502 --> 12:17.937
So take a big bunch of cards,

12:17.970 --> 12:19.105
like half of the cards.

12:19.138 --> 12:20.473
Yes, take a big bunch
like that one.

12:20.506 --> 12:21.974
And face up.
Put it there.

12:22.007 --> 12:23.175
There, yes.

12:23.209 --> 12:24.343
We are going
to eliminate those cards.

12:24.376 --> 12:26.245
Just put them there.
Yes, that's it.

12:26.278 --> 12:28.748
You are going to make all
the decisions here, Alyson.

12:28.781 --> 12:30.082
You're going to make
all the decisions.

12:30.116 --> 12:31.984
So from where do you want
to eliminate cards?

12:32.017 --> 12:33.619
From top, from bottom,
or from the middle?

12:33.652 --> 12:35.154
- Um, middle.
- Middle, okay.

12:35.187 --> 12:36.489
Take a bunch of cards
from the middle.

12:36.522 --> 12:38.124
Yes.
Take, take, take, take.

12:38.157 --> 12:39.759
It's up to you.
You make all the decisions.

12:39.792 --> 12:40.860
- Okay.
- So face up and put it there.

12:40.893 --> 12:42.194
Yeah, right there.
From where?

12:42.228 --> 12:43.829
From top, bottom, middle?
It's up to you.

12:43.863 --> 12:45.765
- Bottom.
- Bottom, okay.

12:45.798 --> 12:47.366
Bottom okay.
Take the cards, put it there.

12:47.399 --> 12:49.335
From where?
Now we have less cards.

12:49.368 --> 12:51.003
So only two or three cards.
From where?

12:51.036 --> 12:52.805
From middle, from bottom?
- Mm, top.

12:52.838 --> 12:54.373
- From, top, okay.
Okay, okay, okay.

12:54.406 --> 12:56.509
Those--okay, yes.
It's okay, it's okay.

12:56.542 --> 12:58.310
So, now how many?
Five.

12:58.344 --> 12:59.478
One more card.
Only one.

12:59.512 --> 13:00.279
Only one.
Which one?

13:00.312 --> 13:02.448
That one?
Okay.

13:02.481 --> 13:04.283
This is an intuition test.

13:04.316 --> 13:07.052
Let's see Alyson's intuition.

13:07.086 --> 13:09.155
Look.
We have here--

13:09.188 --> 13:10.923
it's the four aces.
- Oh!

13:10.956 --> 13:12.057
[applause]

13:12.091 --> 13:14.660
All right.

13:14.693 --> 13:16.428
- You are amazing!
- I'm amazing.

13:18.764 --> 13:20.733
- I have another plan.
- Okay.

13:20.766 --> 13:23.435
- What if instead
Alyson tried to fool you,

13:23.469 --> 13:25.070
you try to fool yourself?

13:25.104 --> 13:26.172
- Okay.

13:26.205 --> 13:27.306
- So, if you--if you
do fool yourself,

13:27.339 --> 13:29.742
it's our success.
- Uh-huh.

13:29.775 --> 13:31.944
If you don't, it's your fault.

13:31.977 --> 13:33.179
- Yes, yes.
[laughter]

13:33.212 --> 13:34.413
- That's the same, yes.

13:34.446 --> 13:35.414
Eh, let's do it like this.

13:35.447 --> 13:36.816
First I am going to--to shuffle

13:36.849 --> 13:38.317
a little--little bit.

13:38.350 --> 13:40.619
And please, Teller,
you say stop whenever you want.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.621
Say stop.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.356
Before I finish it.
- [laughs]

13:44.390 --> 13:45.424
- Eh!
Okay.

13:45.457 --> 13:46.759
Take a look at this card.

13:46.792 --> 13:48.294
It's not important,
the number of the card.

13:48.327 --> 13:50.830
The important thing
is the suit of the card, okay?

13:50.863 --> 13:51.931
The same for you.
- Okay.

13:51.964 --> 13:52.932
- You say stop
whenever you want.

13:52.965 --> 13:53.933
- Stop.
- Okay.

13:53.966 --> 13:55.634
You have this card?
The suit?

13:55.668 --> 13:57.002
Okay.
Keep that suit in your mind.

13:57.036 --> 13:59.038
Alyson, which one
do you want to use?

13:59.071 --> 14:00.105
Penn or Teller's?
Which one?

14:00.139 --> 14:02.208
- Well, he talks more.
So that one.

14:02.241 --> 14:04.777
- So now you are going to take
out from the pack 12 cards,

14:04.810 --> 14:07.046

this 12 cards

14:07.079 --> 14:08.581

of the pack,

14:08.614 --> 14:09.882
let me--I am going
to take out the aces.

14:09.915 --> 14:10.916
Won't use these four.

14:10.950 --> 14:12.318
In order to take the cards

14:12.351 --> 14:13.552
from different part
of the pack,

14:13.586 --> 14:14.887
we are going to do three piles.

14:14.920 --> 14:16.455
- Okay.
- So, look.

14:16.488 --> 14:18.624
This is going
to be the first pile.

14:18.657 --> 14:19.458
This is going to be
the second one.

14:19.491 --> 14:20.759
And the third one.

14:20.793 --> 14:22.294
So, starting with you
please take your packet.

14:22.328 --> 14:23.596
Shuffle the cards.

14:23.629 --> 14:25.764

any four cards you like.

Face down, face down.

So we keep the mystery there.

14:30.369 --> 14:32.137
We'll do a pile there.

14:32.171 --> 14:33.472
And we have any four.
Okay.

14:33.505 --> 14:34.974
This packet, leave it there.

The same--the same
for you please.

Did you shuffle the cards?

14:39.812 --> 14:41.013
And the same.
Four cards.

Any four cards you like.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.583
It's up to you.
Put it there.

14:44.617 --> 14:45.951
- All together.
All together.

Okay.
You shuffle the cards same.

- Don't worry.

15:10.109 --> 15:11.310
So this one,
we don't need anymore.

15:11.343 --> 15:13.545
So, we have the 12 cards
you have chosen,

15:13.579 --> 15:15.381
and also we have the four aces.

15:15.414 --> 15:17.049

the ace of spades here.

And now, let's see
your intuition this time.

We have a spade.

Well, I have to tell you.
This never happens.

35:33.331 --> 35:35.766
teaching you a move in magic

35:35.800 --> 35:38.269
is all gonna be
in Teller's words.

35:38.302 --> 35:41.172
Every single word I say

35:41.205 --> 35:42.673
is written by Teller

35:42.707 --> 35:44.242
with no editing by me.

35:44.275 --> 35:46.611
So if you have at home

35:46.644 --> 35:49.947
a little aluminum foil ball,
or a coin, or a key,

35:49.981 --> 35:51.849
you can do this
along with Teller,

35:51.883 --> 35:54.619
and learn a magic move called

35:54.652 --> 35:56.521
The French Drop.

35:58.523 --> 36:00.525
This is all Teller.

36:00.558 --> 36:02.126
[laughter]

36:02.160 --> 36:03.728
Good evening,

36:03.761 --> 36:06.931
students of the venerable art
of chicanery.

36:06.964 --> 36:08.099
[laughter]

36:08.132 --> 36:10.368
The subterfuge
you're about to learn

36:10.401 --> 36:12.403
will enable you
to convince an audience

36:12.436 --> 36:14.438
that an object is here

36:14.472 --> 36:17.708
when in truth, it is there.

36:17.742 --> 36:20.745
The maneuver is called
The French Drop.

36:20.778 --> 36:24.315
It is the most versatile move
in sleight of hand.

36:24.348 --> 36:27.585
Every serious conjuror
must learn it.

36:27.618 --> 36:30.922
It is the magician's
rite to passage.

36:30.955 --> 36:32.156
Let us--

36:32.190 --> 36:33.291
- [whispering indistinctly]
- All right.

36:33.324 --> 36:34.825
[in accent]
De passage.

36:34.859 --> 36:37.495
It is the magician's
rite de passage.

36:37.528 --> 36:39.163
Let us begin.

36:39.197 --> 36:40.398
Hold the ball

36:40.431 --> 36:42.166
between the thumb
and index finger

36:42.200 --> 36:44.001
of your right hand.

36:44.035 --> 36:47.004
Now allow the ball to roll
lightly into the palm.

36:47.038 --> 36:50.241
There's no effort.
Gravity does the work.

36:50.274 --> 36:51.809
Now repeat.

36:51.842 --> 36:55.413
But this time, bring the ball
to the left hand.

36:55.446 --> 36:59.183
Allow the left thumb to pass
under the right thumb.

36:59.217 --> 37:02.220
Close the fingers over the ball
as if taking it

37:02.253 --> 37:05.923
but secretly let it roll down
into the right palm

37:05.957 --> 37:08.025
as your left hand simulates

37:08.059 --> 37:10.761
the presence of the ball,
and moves away.

37:12.096 --> 37:14.131
To do this convincingly

37:14.165 --> 37:17.702
requires some study.

37:17.735 --> 37:19.370
Place the ball in your hand,

37:19.403 --> 37:22.773
and note the exact position
of the fingers.

37:22.807 --> 37:24.408
Now remove the ball,

37:24.442 --> 37:26.744
and match that finger position.

37:26.777 --> 37:28.813
The hand may be partly open

37:28.846 --> 37:30.915
but only you can see that flaw.

37:30.948 --> 37:32.216
[laughter]

37:32.250 --> 37:35.219
Try to feel the imaginary ball

37:35.253 --> 37:36.887
in your hand.
[laughter]

37:36.921 --> 37:39.490
The more real
it becomes to you,

37:39.523 --> 37:42.727
the more real it will seem
to the spectators.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.962
But be warned.

37:44.996 --> 37:47.431
At the moment you do
The French Drop,

37:47.465 --> 37:49.567
if you are
an honest human being,

37:49.600 --> 37:52.737
you will feel guilt.

37:52.770 --> 37:55.406
[laughter]

37:55.439 --> 37:57.675
You may reflexively
blink your eyes

37:57.708 --> 38:00.778
to avoid beholding
your wickedness.

38:00.811 --> 38:03.114
Blinking is
an unconscious giveaway,

38:03.147 --> 38:05.850
what we call "a tell."

38:05.883 --> 38:08.352
My tell is to look up

38:08.386 --> 38:10.254
with my eyebrows raised

38:10.288 --> 38:12.957
in frank, wide-eyed innocence.

38:12.990 --> 38:15.092
[laughter]

38:15.126 --> 38:17.428
Penn's tell is
to clear his throat,

38:17.461 --> 38:20.131
and do the move
at blistering speed

38:20.164 --> 38:21.565
to get it out of the way.

38:21.599 --> 38:23.100
Yeah.
I do that.

38:23.134 --> 38:24.769
[laughter]

38:24.802 --> 38:26.804
To minimize these tells,

38:26.837 --> 38:29.040
follow the movement
of the imaginary ball

38:29.073 --> 38:30.608
with your eyes.

38:30.641 --> 38:33.644
Shamelessly look directly
at your hands

38:33.678 --> 38:35.546
and move them suavely

38:35.579 --> 38:38.082
in a smooth, continuous line.

38:38.115 --> 38:39.750
[laughter]

38:39.784 --> 38:42.453
Now enlist the aid
of a patient friend

38:42.486 --> 38:44.388
with a massive tolerance

38:44.422 --> 38:46.324
for mind-numbing repetition.

38:46.357 --> 38:47.425
[laughter]

38:47.458 --> 38:49.093
As an only child,

38:49.126 --> 38:51.495
I used my mother.

38:51.529 --> 38:54.432
Alternate between genuinely
passing the ball

38:55.333 --> 38:58.602
and doing The French Drop.

38:58.636 --> 39:02.239
When your mate, your mother,
or your mirror

39:02.273 --> 39:04.575
can't tell true from false,

39:04.608 --> 39:06.577
or catch a flash of guilt

39:06.610 --> 39:08.879
on your dishonest face...

39:08.913 --> 39:10.014
[laughter]

39:10.047 --> 39:11.716
Congratulate yourself.

39:11.749 --> 39:12.883
[applause]

39:12.917 --> 39:15.119
You've trained yourself to lie

39:15.152 --> 39:16.921
in cold blood.

39:16.954 --> 39:19.957
Or as the French say,
sang-froid.

39:19.990 --> 39:21.792
- [whispering indistinctly]

39:21.826 --> 39:23.427
[in exaggerated French accent]
Sang-froid!

39:23.461 --> 39:27.298
As the French say,
sang-froid.

39:27.331 --> 39:30.568
At last, you're ready
to do magic.

39:30.601 --> 39:32.870
Reach into your pocket
for some magic dust,

39:32.903 --> 39:35.039
and ditch the ball.

39:35.072 --> 39:38.709
Sprinkle your hands but don't
immediately show it empty.

39:38.743 --> 39:41.212
Make it a magical drama.

39:41.245 --> 39:42.747
The ball is melting!

39:42.780 --> 39:45.649
It's burning your flesh
like hot steam.

39:45.683 --> 39:47.551
[laughter]

39:47.585 --> 39:50.621
[applause]

39:52.490 --> 39:55.593
Try The French Drop
for a transformation.

39:55.626 --> 39:57.161
With a little preparation...
[crowd oohs]

39:57.194 --> 40:00.364
A ball blooms into a flower.

40:01.365 --> 40:04.668
[cheers and applause]

40:04.702 --> 40:06.270
To make young children

40:06.303 --> 40:08.672
shriek with laughter,

40:08.706 --> 40:11.275
pre-set a grape in your mouth.

40:11.308 --> 40:13.744
Then take a second grape,

40:13.778 --> 40:15.980
and handling
it just like the ball,

40:16.013 --> 40:18.749
pretend to smash it
against your head.

40:18.783 --> 40:20.117
Then--

40:20.151 --> 40:22.820
[laughter]

40:22.853 --> 40:26.023
The children will be
so busy chasing the grape

40:26.056 --> 40:27.625
across the floor,

40:27.658 --> 40:29.326
they won't notice you

40:29.360 --> 40:31.262
eating the evidence.

40:31.295 --> 40:34.064
[laughter]
[cheers and applause]

40:37.668 --> 40:40.704
This single, simple sleight

40:40.738 --> 40:44.108
opens the door
to so many wonders.

40:44.141 --> 40:45.810
Practice it well.

40:45.843 --> 40:48.345
Then go forth
and astonish the world

40:48.379 --> 40:50.381
with The French Drop.

40:50.414 --> 40:52.149
Or as they say in France,

40:52.183 --> 40:54.452
Le Tourniquet.

40:54.485 --> 40:56.220
[laughter]
- [whispering indistinctly]

40:56.253 --> 40:58.789
- Le Tourniquet.
Le tour--

40:58.823 --> 41:01.258
or The French Drop,
or as they say in France...

41:01.292 --> 41:03.494
- Le Tourniquet.

41:03.527 --> 41:04.762
[all gasping]
Le Tourniquet.

41:04.795 --> 41:07.231
Just drop the terminal T.

41:07.264 --> 41:08.399
Come on.
Everybody with me.

41:08.432 --> 41:10.334
Le Tourniquet.
Ready?

41:10.367 --> 41:12.603
all: Le Tour-ni-quet.

41:12.636 --> 41:14.138
Try again.

41:14.171 --> 41:17.141
["Le Marseillaise" playing]

41:17.174 --> 41:20.511
[cheers and applause]

41:20.544 --> 41:22.746
- Ah!

41:22.780 --> 41:24.949
I've gotta make
tonight's show disappear,

41:24.982 --> 41:27.017
and now I know how to,

41:27.051 --> 41:28.486
thanks to Penn and Teller.

41:28.519 --> 41:29.987
Come back next week

41:30.020 --> 41:31.989
when we reappear
with more fools.

41:32.022 --> 41:33.357
- More "Fool Us" next week.

41:33.390 --> 41:34.692
More "Fool Us" next week.

41:34.725 --> 41:38.195
[cheers and applause]
