00:35.500 --> 00:38.000
Richard, he's fine.

00:38.500 --> 00:39.500
Who?

00:40.000 --> 00:41.100
Zedd.

00:41.100 --> 00:41.800
What are you talking about?

00:41.800 --> 00:44.200
You can't hide anything from me.

00:44.800 --> 00:46.500
There's nothing to worry about.

00:47.100 --> 00:48.500
Trust me.

00:49.600 --> 00:51.600
Do you know where Zedd went?

00:52.800 --> 00:55.500
He told you where he's hiding 
the Box of Orden, didn't he?

00:56.300 --> 00:59.300
I can't believe he would 
trust you and not me.

01:02.600 --> 01:05.500
I have no idea where Zedd is.

01:08.100 --> 01:09.900
You enjoyed that, didn't you?

01:12.500 --> 01:13.400
Come on.

01:23.400 --> 01:24.500
Stop!

01:25.500 --> 01:28.600
Who are you and why are you following us?

01:33.100 --> 01:34.500
Chase.

01:40.300 --> 01:41.200
What are you doing here?

01:41.200 --> 01:42.800
I'll explain everything,

01:42.800 --> 01:45.000
but there's a D'Haran quad on my tail.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.700
I have a feeling they consider 
the Seeker a bigger prize than me.

01:49.600 --> 01:54.600
Legend Of The Seeker S01 EP14

02:14.700 --> 02:16.000
He's dead.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.600
Chase, stop!

02:56.700 --> 02:58.800
Hey. It's okay. It's okay.

02:58.800 --> 03:00.400
It's all right.

03:08.500 --> 03:10.000
Better? 

03:11.400 --> 03:14.700
Now maybe you can tell us

03:14.700 --> 03:18.300
what you're doing in the Midlands?

03:23.200 --> 03:25.600
I've been in a D'Haran labor camp.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.500
You remember that dragon?

03:29.500 --> 03:31.600
The one that tried to kill my daughter?

03:31.900 --> 03:33.700
Laura!

03:38.600 --> 03:39.800
The Gar.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
After the Boundary was opened,

03:44.300 --> 03:47.300
dozens of those beasts 
swarmed into Hartland.

03:51.100 --> 03:52.900
They slaughtered livestock...

03:55.700 --> 03:57.100
...children.

04:00.300 --> 04:02.500
I had to do something, so 

04:02.500 --> 04:04.700
I went to see your brother.

04:09.800 --> 04:11.800
What are you doing here, Chase?

04:11.900 --> 04:13.800
If I'm to save this village,

04:13.800 --> 04:16.399
I need every able-bodied 
man back under my command.

04:16.399 --> 04:18.600
You're not the captain 
of the Guard anymore.

04:18.600 --> 04:20.800
You lost that honor when 
you sided with my brother.

04:20.800 --> 04:23.500
There are monsters out 
there, killing our people.

04:23.500 --> 04:27.000
Citizens that you as First 
Councilor are sworn to protect.

04:28.100 --> 04:30.200
Now let me do my job.

04:33.700 --> 04:36.200
This time, your brother 
did the right thing.

04:37.500 --> 04:39.700
But when we reached the Boundary 

04:40.000 --> 04:42.700
it wasn't just Gars we had to deal with.

04:44.200 --> 04:47.200
A battalion of D'Harans was coming in.

04:48.300 --> 04:50.000
We tried to fight but they--

04:50.600 --> 04:53.400
They killed most of my men 
and apped me in irons.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.700
Those D'Harans...

05:03.600 --> 05:06.500
they know how to break a man's spirit.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.700
I almost gave up, but...

05:11.000 --> 05:12.500
a few days ago,

05:12.600 --> 05:16.900
they brought in another prisoner, 
telling tales of the Seeker.

05:17.100 --> 05:19.200
He had heard you were nearby.

05:19.600 --> 05:23.400
That my friend Richard Cypher 
had the D'Harans on the run.

05:24.100 --> 05:26.600
You don't know the strength that gave me.

05:26.700 --> 05:28.100
The hope.

05:29.200 --> 05:32.700
Next chance I got, I made a run for it.

05:35.900 --> 05:37.500
But I knew they'd send a quad after me

05:37.500 --> 05:40.500
and I was in no shape to stay 
ahead of them for long, so...

05:42.700 --> 05:44.500
I came looking for you.

05:47.500 --> 05:49.600
I can't thank you enough.

05:55.500 --> 05:56.800
Now 

05:56.900 --> 05:59.200
if you can spare a horse and some food...

06:01.100 --> 06:02.500
Chase, what are you talking about?

06:02.500 --> 06:03.800
You're with us now.

06:03.800 --> 06:05.800
I gotta get back to Hartland.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.200
I gotta find my family.

06:09.100 --> 06:11.200
Then we're coming with you.

06:12.800 --> 06:15.600
But Darken Rahl is in 
the opposite direction.

06:15.600 --> 06:17.000
Kahlan's right.

06:17.300 --> 06:19.500
You have a bigger fight, my friend.

06:19.700 --> 06:21.800
I've seen what Rahl's forces can do to people.

06:21.800 --> 06:25.500
If I can't protect my own village,
what kind of a Seeker am I?

06:33.200 --> 06:35.300
Both of you are wanted men.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.900
If we're going to do this...

06:39.500 --> 06:41.800
you should dress appropriately.

07:18.600 --> 07:20.700
So how do we get past them?

07:21.300 --> 07:22.400
We have these uniforms.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.500
Maybe we can just walk through.

07:24.800 --> 07:27.200
If they start asking questions?

07:29.300 --> 07:31.900
I know how we can get across.

07:37.200 --> 07:38.900
Your orders, sir.

07:39.300 --> 07:41.200
Do you recognize this?

07:41.400 --> 07:42.200
Dragon Corps.

07:42.200 --> 07:44.900
No member of the Corps 
answers to a foot soldier.

07:44.900 --> 07:46.300
Now move.

07:46.300 --> 07:47.400
I'm sorry, sir.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.900
No one may pass 
without proper documents.

07:49.900 --> 07:51.800
By order of the viceroy.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.800
Funny you should mention the viceroy.

07:56.400 --> 07:59.200
Guess who we're delivering 
this little lovely to?

07:59.700 --> 08:01.400
Now, if you turn us away, 

08:01.400 --> 08:05.300
he's gonna demand to know who 
disrupted his entertainment plans.

08:08.100 --> 08:09.700
Let them pass!

08:25.000 --> 08:25.900
Emma?

08:26.700 --> 08:28.200
Emma! Laura!

08:32.799 --> 08:34.799
No one's been here in a while.

08:37.500 --> 08:40.100
If those bastards have 
done anything to my family...

08:40.100 --> 08:41.200
We'll go into town. 

08:41.200 --> 08:42.900
We'll find someone who 
knows where they are.

09:03.400 --> 09:05.600
They are D'Harans everywhere.

09:11.400 --> 09:13.200
They've taken over.

09:18.800 --> 09:20.100
Anna?

09:24.100 --> 09:25.300
Who is she?

09:26.000 --> 09:27.900
Just someone I used to know.

09:29.200 --> 09:32.000
Oh, I'd say she was a 
little more than that.

10:04.700 --> 10:06.100
It's Michael.

10:10.100 --> 10:11.800
People of Hartland, 

10:12.400 --> 10:14.100
let us pray.

10:17.400 --> 10:20.300
Master Rahl, guide us.

10:20.600 --> 10:23.200
Master Rahl, teach us.

10:23.700 --> 10:26.300
Master Rahl, protect us.

10:27.700 --> 10:30.600
In your light we thrive.

10:30.900 --> 10:33.200
In your mercy we are sheltered.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.800
In your wisdom we are humbled. 

10:42.500 --> 10:45.500
Seek cover! Protect yourselves!

11:04.100 --> 11:05.800
Brave soldiers, 

11:05.800 --> 11:09.700
all of Hartland thanks you and 
honors you for your courage!

11:17.000 --> 11:20.800
All hail the savior of 
Hartland: Lord Rahl!

11:20.800 --> 11:35.700
All hail Lord Rahl!

11:43.100 --> 11:45.800
Things have really changed around here.

11:46.400 --> 11:49.500
It's almost as if everyone's 
under the D'Harans' spell.

11:50.400 --> 11:53.200
If there's magic at work, 
we can't trust anyone.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.700
So how do we find my family?

12:13.200 --> 12:14.900
Hello, Michael.

12:16.400 --> 12:17.900
Richard?

12:18.200 --> 12:20.200
Surprised to see me?

12:20.900 --> 12:21.800
How did you get past my--

12:21.800 --> 12:23.300
Quiet.

12:23.600 --> 12:26.200
Now, we're walking out of here together.

12:26.300 --> 12:27.500
If you try to call for help,

12:27.500 --> 12:30.000
you'll be dead before you get 
the words out of your mouth.

12:30.300 --> 12:34.100
Richard, you wouldn't 
kill your own brother.

12:34.500 --> 12:37.400
I seem to remember you 
telling me we weren't brothers,

12:37.500 --> 12:41.000
right after you accused me of killing Dad.

12:41.400 --> 12:43.300
Now move.

12:44.700 --> 12:46.200
Where is my family?

12:46.200 --> 12:47.300
The D'Harans moved them.

12:47.300 --> 12:48.300
Moved them where? 

12:48.300 --> 12:50.400
I don't know. Someplace safe.

12:50.500 --> 12:52.300
Gars were attacking people along the border.

12:52.300 --> 12:55.500
You expect me to believe those 
butchers are interested in my family?

12:55.500 --> 12:57.700
I don't know where they are.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.800
I swear it.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.800
Look at me.

13:12.900 --> 13:14.900
He's telling the truth.

13:15.500 --> 13:16.600
Of course I am.

13:16.600 --> 13:18.900
The D'Harans saved Hartland.

13:19.500 --> 13:21.200
Saved? How?

13:21.200 --> 13:23.700
Lord Rahl sent his sorcerers 
to seal the Boundary,

13:23.700 --> 13:27.000
to protect us from the Gars and 
the other magic that was coming through.

13:27.200 --> 13:28.600
But they couldn't close it again.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.600
So Lord Rahl sent soldiers to protect us.

13:30.600 --> 13:32.600
The D'Harans are liars and murderers.

13:32.600 --> 13:34.900
You really believe they're 
here for the good of Hartland?

13:34.900 --> 13:37.000
The Gars are no longer killing our people.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.700
Our village is safe, prosperous.

13:40.400 --> 13:42.600
And we have Lord Rahl to thank for that.

13:43.100 --> 13:46.500
Oh, I imagine you have a lot 
to thank Lord Rahl for.

13:46.700 --> 13:48.700
So who do you take orders from 

13:48.700 --> 13:51.800
in exchange for all this 
safety and prosperity?

13:55.800 --> 13:57.400
The viceroy.

14:03.700 --> 14:05.100
Viceroy.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.600
The Gar attack has alarmed the villagers.

14:08.800 --> 14:11.800
More are asking to be 
moved away from the Boundary.

14:12.700 --> 14:14.400
Do as they ask.

14:15.300 --> 14:17.800
Sir, why do we coddle these people?

14:18.200 --> 14:20.200
Hearts and minds, lieutenant.

14:20.800 --> 14:22.600
Our army is stretched thin.

14:22.700 --> 14:26.200
We can't subjugate every village 
in the three territories by force.

14:26.500 --> 14:30.400
So if Lord Rahl's empire is to expand, 
he must be a friend to the people.

14:32.400 --> 14:35.500
Now if that's all, I have a 
personal matter to attend to.

15:04.800 --> 15:06.400
Hello, viceroy.

15:09.200 --> 15:10.600
Sorry I'm late.

15:10.600 --> 15:12.000
I brought you a little something.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.200
Anna.

15:13.200 --> 15:14.600
Thank you.

15:31.800 --> 15:34.900
I guess things around here have 
changed more than we thought.

15:43.500 --> 15:45.000
Viceroy.

15:45.200 --> 15:49.300
I invited you here for a 
meal, some conversation.

15:49.500 --> 15:52.100
I think maybe you have the 
wrong impression of me.

15:52.100 --> 15:54.400
I can't help myself when 
I'm around you, Anna.

15:54.700 --> 15:57.700
If I didn't know better, I'd say 
you had put me under an enchantment.

15:57.900 --> 16:01.700
Do clever words like those 
make other girls swoon?

16:03.600 --> 16:05.200
There are no others.

16:05.200 --> 16:09.000
You expect me to believe that a 
dashing, brilliant man like you 

16:09.000 --> 16:13.700
has no prospects other than a 
simple girl from Hartland?

16:15.000 --> 16:18.100
Simple is not a word I would 
use to describe you, Anna.

16:21.200 --> 16:23.000
Are we just gonna wait 
out here all night?

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
Look, this can't be easy for you,

16:25.000 --> 16:27.200
knowing what's probably happening in there.

16:27.200 --> 16:30.300
But if we force our way 
in, Anna could get hurt.

16:33.800 --> 16:36.200
Is there any news of my brother?

16:36.400 --> 16:38.800
I've got every available 
man searching for him.

16:39.300 --> 16:41.600
I'll find him. I promise.

16:42.800 --> 16:44.000
Anna?

16:44.600 --> 16:46.700
I'm going to take care of you.

16:49.900 --> 16:51.800
This isn't your home.

16:51.900 --> 16:54.100
Someday you'll have to leave.

16:54.500 --> 16:56.300
Is that what's bothering you?

16:58.900 --> 17:02.800
I've requested permanent assignment 
as Lord Rahl's envoy in Hartland.

17:03.100 --> 17:05.700
I've fallen in love with 
this charming village.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.700
Just as I'm falling in love with you.

17:15.800 --> 17:17.800
Oh, are you all right?

17:19.200 --> 17:20.300
Too much wine.

17:20.300 --> 17:21.800
Sit down.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.400
Hey.

18:00.500 --> 18:02.000
We can't just stand here.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.400
Richard.

18:14.400 --> 18:16.200
Richard?

18:18.300 --> 18:20.600
Chase? I don't believe it.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.100
What are you doing here? I-- I heard--

18:25.800 --> 18:26.600
Are you--?

18:26.600 --> 18:30.300
No, we're just trying 
not to be recognized.

18:31.100 --> 18:32.100
I don't understand.

18:32.100 --> 18:33.500
Anna, 

18:33.700 --> 18:35.300
we don't have a lot of time.

18:35.300 --> 18:37.400
We know the viceroy's in there.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.400
Have you been spying on me?

18:40.900 --> 18:42.400
Richard, it's not what you think.

18:42.400 --> 18:45.000
You don't owe me an explanation.

18:45.300 --> 18:47.900
But these D'Harans are dangerous.

18:47.900 --> 18:49.200
You can't trust that man.

18:49.200 --> 18:52.300
I know. That's why I've been 
trying to get close to him.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.000
My brother's missing.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.400
He hasn't been seen in months.

18:57.400 --> 19:00.000
Rumors are the D'Harans 
are kidnapping people,

19:00.000 --> 19:02.500
forcing them to serve in Darken Rahl's army.

19:03.600 --> 19:06.000
Chase's family is missing too.

19:06.800 --> 19:08.100
I'm sorry.

19:08.100 --> 19:11.300
What would their army want 
with my wife and children?

19:12.200 --> 19:14.100
Anna, you should probably go.

19:15.200 --> 19:18.600
We're going to speak to the viceroy 
and it's better if you're not around.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.100
You can't.

19:20.100 --> 19:22.800
I sprinkled Rama leaf into his wine.

19:22.800 --> 19:25.200
He'll be out for at least two hours.

19:28.300 --> 19:30.300
But I do have this.

19:31.200 --> 19:32.300
A key?

19:32.300 --> 19:34.600
To the safe in the viceroy's chambers.

19:34.700 --> 19:37.700
If the D'Harans did have 
something to do with all this,

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
the answers may be in there.

19:44.500 --> 19:46.200
Chase will warn us if anyone comes along,

19:46.200 --> 19:47.700
but we'd better hurry.

19:51.600 --> 19:54.000
When I came back to 
Hartland, I looked for you.

19:54.400 --> 19:57.200
They told me you'd fallen 
under the spell of a witch,

19:57.200 --> 19:59.800
killed your father, and 
gone to the Midlands.

19:59.800 --> 20:01.600
Anna, that's not true.

20:03.900 --> 20:05.300
Do you remember when we were little 

20:05.300 --> 20:09.800
and you thought you saw a 
tree goblin behind your house?

20:10.900 --> 20:13.500
I told the constable we both saw it.

20:13.500 --> 20:15.300
Do you know why?

20:15.500 --> 20:17.700
Because I believed you.

20:18.900 --> 20:22.800
Just like I'll believe you now 
if you tell me what really happened.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.300
I went to the Midlands because of 
a thousand-year-old prophecy.

20:29.300 --> 20:32.900
It says I'm destined to kill Darken 
Rahl and free the world from his tyranny.

20:35.700 --> 20:37.800
Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it?

20:39.000 --> 20:40.500
No.

20:41.500 --> 20:45.100
I always had a feeling you 
were meant for bigger things.

20:45.700 --> 20:48.000
Maybe that's why I moved away.

20:48.900 --> 20:51.600
Something told me you were 
gonna leave Hartland, so 

20:51.900 --> 20:55.000
I left before I got my heart broken.

21:00.300 --> 21:01.700
Over here.

21:17.300 --> 21:19.000
It's a record book.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.300
Troop deployments, supply requests.

21:23.900 --> 21:25.400
Transport orders.

21:25.400 --> 21:27.100
There's a list of names.

21:30.200 --> 21:31.500
There's your brother.

21:32.700 --> 21:35.900
So the D'Harans did take 
him. Does it say where?

21:36.300 --> 21:37.800
Northwood Grove.

21:37.800 --> 21:39.600
It's only a few leagues from Hartland.

21:39.600 --> 21:41.600
He was taken there two months ago.

21:42.800 --> 21:44.700
All of these people were sent there.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.800
That doesn't make any sense.

21:46.800 --> 21:48.300
There's nothing in that grove.

21:48.300 --> 21:50.100
What about Chase's family?

21:50.100 --> 21:51.100
They're not here.

21:51.100 --> 21:55.300
Why would the D'Harans send my brother 
to a grove in the middle of nowhere?

22:59.200 --> 23:00.600
We're too late.

23:00.600 --> 23:01.900
He's gone.

23:04.800 --> 23:08.200
They're feeding people to the Gars.

23:19.600 --> 23:21.500
You know, my brother was a good man 

23:22.400 --> 23:24.800
until you put him under your spell.

23:29.800 --> 23:31.900
You may have grown up with Richard,

23:31.900 --> 23:34.200
but you don't know the 
first thing about him.

23:34.900 --> 23:37.500
He's not under anyone's spell.

23:38.100 --> 23:40.300
And to the people of the Midlands, 

23:40.500 --> 23:42.100
he's a hero.

23:42.400 --> 23:44.400
Richard Cypher, a hero.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.700
This is what your D'Haran 
friends are doing to your people.

23:53.000 --> 23:53.900
I don't understand--

23:53.900 --> 23:56.000
Don't play stupid, you 
cold-blooded bastard.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.700
Did you feed my family to the Gars?

23:57.700 --> 23:59.400
I don't know what you're talking about.

23:59.400 --> 24:01.900
The D'Harans protect us from the Gars.

24:02.200 --> 24:04.300
That's what they want you to think.

24:04.400 --> 24:07.600
The Gar attack in the square when 
the soldiers shot it out of the sky,

24:07.600 --> 24:08.900
I think it was staged. 

24:08.900 --> 24:10.300
Staged?

24:10.400 --> 24:12.700
They have Gars chained outside town.

24:12.700 --> 24:15.400
When anyone questions why 
the D'Harans are here,

24:15.500 --> 24:17.500
they release one of the Gars.

24:17.500 --> 24:20.100
Their soldiers kill it 
in front of witnesses.

24:20.100 --> 24:23.200
Michael declares the D'Harans heroes,

24:23.500 --> 24:26.300
and everyone pledges 
their allegiance to Rahl.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.800
This is your seal, isn't it?

24:28.800 --> 24:30.900
"Office of the First Council."

24:30.900 --> 24:34.200
You gave the D'Harans these names.

24:34.200 --> 24:35.600
Why?

24:36.600 --> 24:39.800
They wanted volunteers,
men to enlist in their army.

24:39.900 --> 24:42.400
The viceroy asked me for the names 
of the people who didn't wanna join.

24:42.400 --> 24:44.400
People like my brother?

24:44.400 --> 24:49.300
So they sent him to the Grove to be fed 
to the Gars along with all the others.

24:59.800 --> 25:01.400
The viceroy told me

25:01.400 --> 25:04.400
that they would find other
ways for the people to be useful.

25:04.500 --> 25:06.300
They found another way.

25:17.300 --> 25:21.100
They told me Hartland had to do 
its part for the D'Haran cause.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.700
I thought I was keeping the town safe.

25:26.400 --> 25:28.400
I didn't know.

25:28.500 --> 25:31.300
Didn't know, or didn't want to know?

25:45.100 --> 25:47.200
I wanna help you stop them.

25:52.700 --> 25:53.900
How?

25:53.900 --> 25:56.400
Every evening, I lead the town in prayer.

25:57.400 --> 26:00.100
Instead, I could tell people the truth.

26:00.300 --> 26:03.300
I'm still First Councilor, 
they will listen to me.

26:03.400 --> 26:05.000
And they'll rise up.

26:05.400 --> 26:06.300
There's one problem.

26:06.300 --> 26:08.800
The viceroy stands with 
me during the prayer.

26:10.100 --> 26:13.300
Once he realizes what you're 
doing, he'll have you killed.

26:14.200 --> 26:16.600
Not if I distract him.

26:18.200 --> 26:20.000
Distract him how?

26:20.100 --> 26:22.600
I could visit the viceroy in his chambers,

26:22.700 --> 26:24.800
keep him there while 
Michael makes his speech.

26:24.800 --> 26:25.600
- Anna--
- Richard, 

26:25.600 --> 26:29.000
how many more people are gonna 
die if we don't stop them?

26:30.600 --> 26:32.500
There are soldiers in the square.

26:32.600 --> 26:34.200
What if they try and stop the speech?

26:34.200 --> 26:36.500
We'll be there to make sure they don't.

26:36.500 --> 26:40.400
And if Michael points out the 
Seeker to the guards instead?

26:46.200 --> 26:48.200
We'll just have to trust him.

26:55.900 --> 26:57.700
I admire her spirit.

26:57.700 --> 27:00.500
Yeah, she's always had a mind of her own.

27:02.300 --> 27:04.300
How long were the two of you...?

27:04.700 --> 27:06.300
We were always close,

27:06.600 --> 27:08.800
since we were crawling on all fours.

27:08.800 --> 27:12.600
After Darken Rahl is defeated, 
maybe you could come back.

27:12.600 --> 27:15.100
And you and Anna could 
pick up where you left off.

27:15.100 --> 27:16.300
Kahlan,

27:17.100 --> 27:19.200
why are we talking about this?

27:22.700 --> 27:25.500
Because you deserve a normal life.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.600
A wife.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.600
A family.

27:32.100 --> 27:34.200
Wouldn't be fair to Anna.

27:35.600 --> 27:37.400
Why not?

27:39.400 --> 27:42.900
How could I marry her when my 
heart belongs to somebody else?

28:08.100 --> 28:09.600
Wait outside.

28:17.300 --> 28:19.300
I didn't expect to see you.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.200
I thought I'd surprise you.

28:23.800 --> 28:25.800
You were gone when I woke up.

28:27.900 --> 28:29.800
My niece was ill.

28:33.100 --> 28:36.300
And you were so tired, 
I didn't wanna wake you.

28:44.600 --> 28:47.200
I owe you an apology.

28:48.400 --> 28:51.000
I've been pushing you away.

28:52.400 --> 28:54.100
The truth is,

28:54.100 --> 28:56.300
I have feelings for you too.

28:56.300 --> 28:59.300
I was just afraid you were gonna leave.

29:00.200 --> 29:02.500
But now that you're staying...

29:04.900 --> 29:08.000
I don't wanna keep you waiting anymore.

29:35.200 --> 29:36.100
I have to go.

29:36.100 --> 29:37.000
Please stay with me. 

29:37.000 --> 29:38.500
I can't.

29:39.600 --> 29:41.600
But I'll be back.

29:52.700 --> 29:53.700
Anna?

29:54.300 --> 29:55.900
Anna, what are you doing?

29:59.700 --> 30:01.500
Guards!

30:11.900 --> 30:12.500
Why?

30:12.500 --> 30:14.500
You killed my brother!

30:14.600 --> 30:17.900
How many people did you 
feed to those monsters?

30:18.500 --> 30:20.200
How many?!

30:22.000 --> 30:24.600
And I actually thought we had a future.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.800
People of Hartland,

30:38.900 --> 30:42.400
I have something very important 
to talk about this evening.

30:53.800 --> 30:55.500
Is there a problem?

30:56.600 --> 30:57.300
No.

30:57.300 --> 30:59.400
Then begin the invocation.

31:07.800 --> 31:09.600
People of Hartland...

31:14.800 --> 31:16.300
...let us pray.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.300
Master Rahl, guide us.

31:20.900 --> 31:23.200
Master Rahl, teach us.

31:24.500 --> 31:27.000
Master Rahl, protect us.

31:27.300 --> 31:29.300
In your light, we thrive.

31:29.700 --> 31:31.900
In your mercy, we are sheltered.

31:37.900 --> 31:38.800
Where's Anna?

31:38.800 --> 31:39.800
They've taken her. 

31:39.800 --> 31:41.000
Where?

31:41.200 --> 31:43.300
Northwood Grove.

32:20.900 --> 32:22.600
It's the Seeker!

32:43.600 --> 32:45.400
Richard!

32:45.600 --> 32:46.900
Anna. 

33:08.500 --> 33:10.200
Richard!

33:23.200 --> 33:24.500
It's all right.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.500
Viceroy, the prisoner's been rescued 

33:29.600 --> 33:32.300
by a man wielding the Sword of Truth.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.600
Did you know your brother was in Hartland?

33:40.900 --> 33:42.800
Of course not.

33:44.300 --> 33:48.700
Richard Cypher is a traitor to 
my family, he's no brother to me.

33:55.600 --> 33:58.700
Lord Rahl anticipated the 
Seeker might return home.

34:00.500 --> 34:02.800
Lieutenant, you know what your orders are.

34:07.300 --> 34:09.300
What orders?

34:15.800 --> 34:19.000
Richard, you have to leave now.

34:19.100 --> 34:20.000
Leave? Why?

34:20.000 --> 34:22.300
The D'Harans, they lied 
to me from the beginning.

34:22.300 --> 34:24.100
They never tried to close the Boundary.

34:24.100 --> 34:26.400
They've been using magic to keep it open.

34:28.199 --> 34:29.600
How?

34:30.000 --> 34:32.300
The arch they built at the border,

34:32.699 --> 34:35.199
it has magical properties.

34:35.500 --> 34:38.000
It's kept the passage from closing up.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.100
The viceroy's on his 
way to destroy the arch.

34:40.100 --> 34:42.000
He says the Boundary 
will then seal itself.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.699
They'll cut off the 
only route to Hartland.

34:43.699 --> 34:46.400
He says defeating the 
Seeker is more important.

34:47.100 --> 34:49.699
They wanna trap you on 
this side of the border.

34:49.699 --> 34:51.699
Because if you can't 
return to the Midlands,

34:51.699 --> 34:54.699
you'll never be able to defeat Darken Rahl.

34:58.200 --> 35:00.800
Viceroy, a rider approaches.

35:07.600 --> 35:09.100
First Councilor?

35:09.500 --> 35:11.100
Don't do this.

35:11.800 --> 35:14.100
Hartland needs the Boundary open.

35:14.700 --> 35:17.100
You know very well I have 
orders from Lord Rahl.

35:17.200 --> 35:20.100
You'd be cutting off our only 
trade route with the Midlands.

35:20.100 --> 35:21.500
Think of your men.

35:21.700 --> 35:24.600
All of you will be trapped 
on this side of the Boundary.

35:25.100 --> 35:28.300
A sacrifice we're willing 
to make to defeat the Seeker.

35:28.600 --> 35:30.200
I'm not.

35:48.600 --> 35:51.700
Councilor, don't make the 
same mistake your brother did.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.700
One man cannot defy Lord Rahl.

35:55.800 --> 35:57.400
You're right.

37:33.600 --> 37:36.200
Michael! Michael!

37:36.200 --> 37:37.400
Michael.

37:42.300 --> 37:44.000
We'll get you to a healer.

37:46.300 --> 37:49.200
No, it's too late.

37:49.400 --> 37:51.800
Stay with me.

37:54.200 --> 37:56.500
When I see our father 

37:56.500 --> 37:58.400
in the underworld...

38:00.800 --> 38:02.500
I'll tell him

38:03.500 --> 38:05.200
my brother

38:06.000 --> 38:08.100
was a great hero.

38:35.400 --> 38:37.600
You will order the Gars destroyed,

38:37.600 --> 38:40.800
and disband all D'Haran 
forces in Hartland.

38:41.200 --> 38:42.200
Once I've left, 

38:42.200 --> 38:45.900
you will obey Anna's commands as if 
they were my own, do you understand?

38:46.000 --> 38:48.300
I will do as you bid, My Lady.

38:49.700 --> 38:52.400
I wish I could control men like that.

38:54.200 --> 38:56.900
He has to tell the truth, isn't that right?

38:58.700 --> 39:01.000
My family were taken by your men.

39:01.200 --> 39:02.700
Where are they?

39:02.700 --> 39:07.300
I was ordered to gather women and 
children and send them to the Keep of Edraan.

39:09.800 --> 39:11.000
It's in the Midlands.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.800
You've heard of this place?

39:12.800 --> 39:14.500
Only in rumors.

39:15.200 --> 39:18.600
The Keep is protected by 
dark and powerful magic.

39:19.400 --> 39:21.200
Why were they sent there?

39:21.400 --> 39:23.100
I don't know.

39:24.900 --> 39:27.600
We'll find your family, I promise.

39:28.200 --> 39:29.800
Even if we do,

39:31.500 --> 39:35.800
Rahl will keep sending soldiers across 
the Boundary and kill more people.

39:41.900 --> 39:44.800
Then I guess we're going to 
have to do what he wanted.

39:47.900 --> 39:49.800
Close the Boundary.

39:54.600 --> 39:56.500
You'll set the charges 
and destroy the arch 

39:56.500 --> 39:59.800
once Richard, Chase and I 
are on the Midlands side.

40:00.600 --> 40:04.600
After we fought so hard to 
keep the D'Harans from closing it.

40:12.500 --> 40:16.000
I'd ask you to stay, but I 
know you have a bigger destiny.

40:17.400 --> 40:20.000
And other people who need you.

40:30.600 --> 40:35.200
Viceroy, there's something else 
very important I need you to do.

40:38.400 --> 40:43.000
It's an urgent message from 
the high viceroy in Hartland.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.600
What does the viceroy report?

40:46.300 --> 40:51.000
"Lord Rahl, I have the most glorious news."

40:51.100 --> 40:54.800
In accordance with your standing orders, 

40:55.400 --> 40:58.700
the Boundary has been sealed.

41:00.600 --> 41:03.500
As for the Seeker...

41:04.700 --> 41:06.600
What of the Seeker?

41:06.600 --> 41:08.500
My Lord...

41:16.100 --> 41:18.300
Is this message authentic?

41:18.300 --> 41:21.700
It's in the viceroy's 
hand, I'm certain of it.

41:23.500 --> 41:26.200
My Lord, you've succeeded.

41:26.200 --> 41:28.800
The Seeker is dead.

41:59.400 --> 42:02.100
Now there's really no going home again.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.100
I'm sorry about Michael.

42:14.300 --> 42:15.900
We should get moving

42:16.300 --> 42:19.700
before the D'Harans send 
troops to inspect their handiwork.

42:19.900 --> 42:21.400
Well, if we do run into them,

42:21.400 --> 42:24.400
you got an extra pair of 
hands to fight them with now.

00:00.500 --> 00:13.000
