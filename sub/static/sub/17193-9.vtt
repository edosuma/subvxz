35:49.826 --> 35:52.627
and she panicked.

35:52.629 --> 35:55.129
We panicked.

35:55.131 --> 35:58.532
Because you're
my <i>Mo Dluthchara...</i>

brother in life.

36:00.803 --> 36:03.504
I couldn't have
a child with your wife.

36:03.506 --> 36:07.341
We went to Grindle,
begged for help.

36:07.343 --> 36:09.277
Neither of us had
any money

36:09.279 --> 36:11.012
and the days
were passing.

36:13.782 --> 36:17.818
So we paid that woman
with Ellen's locket

36:17.820 --> 36:22.790
and I've been lying
to you, every day.

36:22.792 --> 36:25.126
Each time you stood
in the precinct,

36:25.128 --> 36:27.495
asking if anyone
had seen that locket,

36:27.497 --> 36:29.397
each time you
stayed up late,

36:29.399 --> 36:31.699

for McClarty,

36:31.701 --> 36:35.603

was my lie.

is death

with the guilt,

the courage

37:26.055 --> 37:27.555

You live

kill Francis.

I <i>was</i> going to
kill him.

38:26.606 --> 38:28.839
I was.

38:28.841 --> 38:31.108
But he said
he swore an oath

38:31.110 --> 38:32.643
that he'd
never break,

38:32.645 --> 38:34.712
whether I took
his life or not,

and I could see the

39:06.112 --> 39:09.246
Crying.

Crying. A knock.
It echoes.

39:13.486 --> 39:16.553
Endlessly, the crying
and the knock.

the noise,

I can make
the crying go away,

talk to me.

39:45.418 --> 39:48.018
I watched what
she did to me.

39:48.020 --> 39:52.489
I saw the blood,
pieces of flesh.

39:52.491 --> 39:55.726
I heard
the baby cry.

39:57.462 --> 39:58.929

not possible.

39:58.931 --> 40:00.864

it's not possible.

but I still hear
the cry.

Called out for you,

got louder.

it was Maggie.
