00:44.504 --> 00:48.035
Hey, come in, come in.

00:48.037 --> 00:49.535
God, the weather's horrible,
isn't it?

00:49.537 --> 00:51.302
Yeah, absolutely.

00:51.304 --> 00:53.271
Take off your coat.
Here, give me that.

00:54.771 --> 00:56.702
- So how are you?
- Good.

00:56.704 --> 00:59.202
- How's school?
- It's okay.

00:59.204 --> 01:02.169
Well, thanks a million
for doing this.

01:02.171 --> 01:03.504
Girls?

01:05.170 --> 01:07.068
- Hi, Sarah.
- Hi, Sophie.

01:07.070 --> 01:09.202
Isabelle?

01:09.204 --> 01:11.469
She's annoyed because
I won't let her see <i>Jaws.</i>

01:11.471 --> 01:13.271
It isn't fair!

01:19.638 --> 01:22.436
- So is it a date?
- Hmm?

01:22.438 --> 01:24.469
That you're going on.

01:24.471 --> 01:26.471
None of your business.

01:29.170 --> 01:33.104
No. It's just an old friend
I'm having a bite to eat with.

01:49.271 --> 01:51.335
Can I get you some water
to start?

01:51.337 --> 01:55.704
Yeah, and a glass of whatever
the house red is would be great.

02:31.337 --> 02:32.371
Hi.

02:34.237 --> 02:35.404
Hi.

03:23.088 --> 03:24.819
We've gone there
three years running,

03:24.821 --> 03:26.685
but we're getting sick of it
now, to be honest

03:26.687 --> 03:29.086
- Well, not sick of it, but...
- You could do with a change.

03:29.088 --> 03:30.618
- Couldn't we, Chris?
- Yeah.

03:30.620 --> 03:32.684
- So where then?
- I don't know.

03:32.686 --> 03:33.852
We were thinking Italy, maybe,

03:33.854 --> 03:35.485
somewhere along
the Amalfi Coast?

03:35.487 --> 03:37.086
Positano I hear is nice.

03:37.088 --> 03:38.918
- Where?
- Positano?

03:38.920 --> 03:40.652
- Right.
- No, I didn't know it either,

03:40.654 --> 03:42.952
but a friend of my sister
says it's very romantic.

03:42.954 --> 03:44.986
- Ooh!
- It's all romantic there.

03:44.988 --> 03:46.852
They're a pretty romantic race,
really, aren't they?

03:46.854 --> 03:49.585
That hot Mediterranean blood,
isn't that what they say?

03:49.587 --> 03:52.552
- Jim has a bit of that in him.
- What? Yeah, right.

03:52.554 --> 03:54.584
Jim works on holiday.

03:54.586 --> 03:57.186
- Do you?
- Well, I work to commission,

03:57.188 --> 03:59.152
so if something needs to be
done by a certain date,

03:59.154 --> 04:00.986
that's when
it has to be done by.

04:00.988 --> 04:02.951
- Oh, I couldn't do that. God!
- Me neither.

04:02.953 --> 04:05.652
When I'm away, I'm away
and to hell with work.

04:05.654 --> 04:08.052
Are you a holiday lover
at all, Chris?

04:08.054 --> 04:11.518
Chris complains when a holiday's
coming up, don't you?

04:11.520 --> 04:12.819
Do I?

04:12.821 --> 04:14.119
You know you do.

04:14.121 --> 04:16.451
But once he's there,
he enjoys it.

04:16.452 --> 04:17.819
That's often all
it's a matter of, isn't it?

04:17.821 --> 04:19.752
Getting there? Oh, it is.

04:19.754 --> 04:22.186
I mean, straight away, you're
in a different frame of mind.

04:22.188 --> 04:24.719
Oh, some of us, anyway.

04:24.721 --> 04:27.186
Gimme a break.
I still enjoy myself.

04:27.188 --> 04:29.852
I know. And we do spend
most of the day as a family.

04:29.854 --> 04:32.518
That's the best part, I think.
Just hanging out as a family.

04:32.520 --> 04:35.052
It happens so rarely for us
these days, to be honest.

04:35.054 --> 04:37.186
And yeah,
it's always so lovely

04:37.188 --> 04:39.719
seeing Chris
spend time with the girls.

04:39.721 --> 04:41.919
- What does that mean?
- Hmm?

04:41.921 --> 04:43.584
I spend as much time as I can
with the girls.

04:43.586 --> 04:44.986
I know you do.

04:44.988 --> 04:47.152
So why are you suggesting
that I don't?

04:47.154 --> 04:49.186
I'm not. What are you
talking about?

04:49.188 --> 04:51.552
I'm talking about you
implying something to people

04:51.554 --> 04:52.985
that isn't the case.

04:52.987 --> 04:56.152
- Oh, Chris...
- I don't think she was, Chris.

04:56.154 --> 04:58.554
That's what I'm
fucking talking about.

05:02.088 --> 05:05.019
I suppose it shows there's often
more going on in a marriage

05:05.021 --> 05:07.619
than people outside of it
are ever aware of.

05:07.621 --> 05:10.886
True.
Fairly ignorant all the same.

05:10.888 --> 05:14.054
Oh, absolutely. Be a prick in
your own bloody house, you know?

05:16.787 --> 05:18.752
Martina was going on
about that play again.

05:18.754 --> 05:21.719
- Right.
- It sounds really good.

05:21.721 --> 05:23.052
What is it?

05:23.054 --> 05:24.986
I can't remember the name.

05:24.988 --> 05:26.952
- Who's it by?
- I don't know.

05:26.954 --> 05:30.552
Do you wanna maybe
go next week, though?

05:30.554 --> 05:32.785
Yeah, I suppose.

05:32.787 --> 05:34.651
You suppose?

05:34.653 --> 05:36.152
What, you want me
to get excited

05:36.154 --> 05:38.885
about a play you don't
even know the name of?

05:38.887 --> 05:40.652
It's a date, though.

05:40.654 --> 05:42.086
So?

05:42.088 --> 05:43.520
With me.

05:46.821 --> 05:48.685
Yeah, I suppose.

05:48.687 --> 05:49.921
Asshole.

06:00.487 --> 06:01.587
Yeah.

06:07.188 --> 06:09.554
You put the bins out,
didn't you?

06:12.487 --> 06:13.785
Fuck.

06:13.787 --> 06:15.552
- You were talking shit!
- I wasn't.

06:15.554 --> 06:17.485
You were, the three of you.
"Chris always complains!"

06:17.487 --> 06:19.219
- When have I ever complained...
- Chris!

06:19.221 --> 06:20.986
about spending time
with you and the girls?

06:20.988 --> 06:22.719
- That wasn't what I meant.
- Of course it was.

06:22.721 --> 06:24.718
Or neglected them in any way?
Never.

06:24.720 --> 06:26.585
- Why are you acting like this?
- Like what?

06:26.587 --> 06:28.485
And why do you expect me
to socialize with people

06:28.487 --> 06:30.086
that I've no fucking
interest in anyway?

06:30.088 --> 06:31.819
You know what? Do not make me
go over there again.

06:31.821 --> 06:33.119
You're trying
to put us together,

06:33.121 --> 06:34.819
make us those kind
of fucking friends.

06:34.821 --> 06:36.819
I'm not! It's me and Danielle
who are friends.

06:36.821 --> 06:39.785
Then be fucking friends
and leave me and Jim out of it!

06:39.787 --> 06:41.186
Do you understand me?

06:41.188 --> 06:43.986
Or include Jim
and leave me out of it!

06:43.988 --> 06:46.787
Either way,
leave me fuck out of it!

06:58.188 --> 06:59.585
I'm going to bed.

06:59.587 --> 07:00.921
Good!

07:02.487 --> 07:04.552
I'll be sleeping
in Sophie's room.

07:04.554 --> 07:07.186
What the fuck do I care?

07:07.188 --> 07:08.986
<i>Still a lot of clouds,</i>

07:08.988 --> 07:11.552
<i>but with just the odd patch
of rain and drizzle.</i>

07:11.554 --> 07:14.513
<i>It'll be mild enough
with highs of around 79</i>

07:14.515 --> 07:18.315
<i>or 10 degrees with mostly
moderate southwest breezes.</i>

07:23.962 --> 07:25.227
So did you get much homework?

07:25.229 --> 07:26.793
About the usual.

07:26.795 --> 07:28.427
- Ben?
- No, not really.

07:28.429 --> 07:31.094
No? Have you maths?

07:31.096 --> 07:32.394
Uh-huh.

07:32.396 --> 07:34.960
- Sentences?
- Yeah.

07:34.962 --> 07:36.494
So why are you saying,
"No, not really?"

07:36.496 --> 07:39.959
- I don't know.
- Because he's an idiot.

07:39.961 --> 07:41.894
Shit!

07:41.896 --> 07:43.361
What is it?

07:43.363 --> 07:45.027
Nothing.

07:45.029 --> 07:46.293
Damn!

07:46.295 --> 07:47.793
You're an idiot.

07:49.096 --> 07:51.294
- <i>Again?</i>
- I know.

07:51.296 --> 07:53.227
<i>Did you knock in
to Mrs. Conway?</i>

07:53.229 --> 07:55.727
Yeah, there's no one in.

07:55.729 --> 07:57.361
<i>I can't come home, Jim.</i>

07:57.363 --> 07:59.826
<i>I told you already,
I have a meeting with Stella.</i>

07:59.828 --> 08:02.427
<i>Actually, you know who I think
has a key? Yvonne.</i>

08:02.429 --> 08:03.993
Yvonne?

08:03.995 --> 08:06.327
<i>What day is it?
And she'll be in.</i>

08:06.329 --> 08:08.226
No, sure, I'll leave it.

08:08.228 --> 08:10.361
<i>You'll leave it? Why?</i>

08:10.363 --> 08:12.393
- After the other night?
- <i>Oh, give me a break.</i>

08:12.395 --> 08:15.027
- It'll be awkward, Danielle.
- <i>It won't be awkward.</i>

08:15.029 --> 08:18.060
<i>Look, I have to go, all right?
Knock in or don't.</i>

08:18.062 --> 08:20.027
- All right.
- <i>All right, bye-bye.</i>

08:20.029 --> 08:21.062
Bye.

08:25.928 --> 08:26.895
Well, Dad?

08:32.195 --> 08:34.293
Hi.

08:34.294 --> 08:36.160
No, it was when you had
your bathroom done,

08:36.163 --> 08:38.260
I think she needed it back,
so the guy could get in and out.

08:38.263 --> 08:40.460
Listen, you're welcome to hang
around here until she gets home.

08:40.462 --> 08:43.461
Ah, no. We wouldn't
wanna get in your way.

08:43.462 --> 08:45.793
Don't be silly.
What's the alternative anyway,

08:45.795 --> 08:47.826
wander the streets
for the afternoon?

08:47.828 --> 08:50.027
Well, I was thinking we might go
and see a movie.

08:50.029 --> 08:52.060
Well, if that's what you
wanna do, then fine,

08:52.062 --> 08:53.959
but just so you know,
you're completely welcome.

08:53.961 --> 08:55.396
Thanks, Yvonne.

08:58.195 --> 09:01.860
So what, you don't work
Tuesdays and Thursdays?

09:01.862 --> 09:03.727
Yeah, just since recently,
actually.

09:03.729 --> 09:06.027
Right, and how do you
find that?

09:06.029 --> 09:07.461
Oh, it's great.

09:07.463 --> 09:09.927
I mean, even just in terms
of commuting, you know?

09:09.929 --> 09:12.227
- Where do you work again?
- Killester.

09:12.229 --> 09:14.427
So yeah, the fact that
I only have to get out there

09:14.429 --> 09:15.959
three times a week now
instead of five

09:15.961 --> 09:18.327
just makes
an enormous difference.

09:18.329 --> 09:20.827
'Course, you wouldn't have
those problems, I suppose.

09:20.829 --> 09:22.294
Or am I being presumptuous?

09:22.296 --> 09:24.293
- Working from home, you mean?
- Yeah.

09:24.295 --> 09:26.060
No, you're not,

09:26.062 --> 09:29.793
but working from home
can present its own challenges.

09:29.795 --> 09:31.461
Really? Like what?

09:31.463 --> 09:33.461
Well, like
keeping disciplined.

09:33.463 --> 09:35.161
Right.

09:35.163 --> 09:38.394
Resisting the urge to
fuck around on the Internet.

09:38.396 --> 09:40.094
Sorry. Shit.

09:40.096 --> 09:41.396
Actually...

09:45.363 --> 09:47.461
- Isabelle?
- Yeah?

09:47.463 --> 09:49.194
Are you guys all okay?

09:49.196 --> 09:50.960
Yeah, we're fine.

09:57.929 --> 09:58.960
Go on.

09:58.962 --> 10:00.960
Fuck around on the Internet.

10:00.962 --> 10:05.027
Yeah, or watch TV.

10:05.029 --> 10:07.093
- Okay.
- Or go back to bed.

10:07.095 --> 10:08.227
Have you done that?

10:08.229 --> 10:09.294
Done what?

10:09.296 --> 10:11.427
Gone back to bed.

10:11.429 --> 10:12.960
Have you not?

10:12.962 --> 10:15.326
Maybe once or twice.

10:15.328 --> 10:18.294
You see? These are
the fucking temptations.

10:26.761 --> 10:28.959
And how do you know?

10:28.961 --> 10:30.461
She told me.

10:30.463 --> 10:31.959
She told you?

10:31.961 --> 10:34.160
Yes.

10:34.162 --> 10:38.427
In fact, she even went so far
as to ask my permission.

10:38.429 --> 10:41.428
As if I'll have a say
in anything once I'm gone.

10:42.829 --> 10:44.296
Permission to what?

10:45.429 --> 10:47.329
To be with you.

10:50.962 --> 10:52.127
And did you give it?

10:52.129 --> 10:55.127
Of course I did.

10:55.129 --> 10:57.363
I want her to be happy.

10:59.729 --> 11:04.062
Although there is one thing
I need to tell you about her.

11:07.395 --> 11:09.094
And that night
didn't come up at all?

11:09.096 --> 11:11.960
- No.
- I told you it wouldn't.

11:11.962 --> 11:14.127
You said
it wouldn't be awkward.

11:14.129 --> 11:15.893
Was it?

11:15.895 --> 11:18.127
It was a bit, actually.
Spending three fucking hours

11:18.129 --> 11:19.760
hanging around
a stranger's house.

11:19.762 --> 11:21.727
She isn't a stranger, Jim.

11:21.729 --> 11:24.294
Oh, would you mind taking the
kids to town someday this week

11:24.296 --> 11:26.160
and getting Alannah
a new shirt for school?

11:26.162 --> 11:27.293
She's complaining
the one she has

11:27.295 --> 11:28.894
is getting
too small for her.

11:28.896 --> 11:31.294
Right. Yeah, sure,
we might go in tomorrow.

11:31.296 --> 11:32.296
Thanks.

11:35.329 --> 11:38.927
So what else
did you not like?

11:38.929 --> 11:40.859
- About the play?
- Yeah.

11:40.861 --> 11:43.329
What else did you not like?

11:46.296 --> 11:48.027
Well?

11:48.029 --> 11:49.461
What?

11:49.463 --> 11:51.394
- How is it?
- Fine.

11:51.396 --> 11:53.094
Does it fit?

11:53.096 --> 11:55.896
I wouldn't say "fine"
if it didn't, Dad.

11:58.862 --> 12:00.194
I'm hungry.

12:03.761 --> 12:05.895
- Now, everything good?
- Great, thank you.

12:08.396 --> 12:10.227
Dad.

12:10.229 --> 12:12.126
Oh, actually...

12:12.128 --> 12:14.060
were the wraps supposed
to come with chips?

12:14.062 --> 12:15.860
They were, yeah.
Why? Did you not get any?

12:15.862 --> 12:17.927
- No.
- Do you want them now?

12:17.929 --> 12:20.194
No, that's fine.
We're just gonna go now.

12:20.196 --> 12:22.427
So what do you want?

12:22.429 --> 12:23.994
Sorry?

12:23.996 --> 12:27.361
What do you want?

12:27.363 --> 12:28.960
Nothing. I just was wondering
if I misunderstood the menu,

12:28.962 --> 12:30.461
that's all.

12:30.463 --> 12:31.695
Right.

12:35.263 --> 12:37.361
Actually, sorry,
you know what?

12:37.363 --> 12:38.860
I hate to make a fuss,

12:38.862 --> 12:40.293
but is that the attitude
you have to take?

12:40.295 --> 12:42.927
- What do you mean?
- Would a simple apology

12:42.929 --> 12:44.493
not be possible without...

12:44.495 --> 12:46.493
- An apology?
- Yeah.

12:46.495 --> 12:48.860
It's not my fault your chips
didn't come with your wraps.

12:48.862 --> 12:51.327
- I never said it was.
- It's the kitchen's.

12:51.329 --> 12:54.194
That's fine. I'm just saying,
you know,

12:54.196 --> 12:56.227
out of, Jesus,
common courtesy...

12:56.229 --> 12:58.427
- Ah, yeah.
- What?

12:58.429 --> 13:01.093
Listen, I don't know
what your problem is,

13:01.095 --> 13:02.760
but I've far more
important things to be doing

13:02.762 --> 13:04.860
than dealing
with this crap.

13:04.862 --> 13:07.762
Go and find someone else
to fucking abuse, all right?

13:17.363 --> 13:19.194
Dad...

13:19.196 --> 13:21.727
she said the F-word.

13:21.729 --> 13:22.662
I know.

13:35.196 --> 13:37.261
Hey!

13:37.263 --> 13:39.759
- Oh, hey. How are you?
- Good. Good.

13:39.761 --> 13:41.194
- You going home?
- Yeah.

13:41.196 --> 13:43.760
- Cool. Hi, girls.
- Hi.

13:43.762 --> 13:45.060
So where were you, town?

13:45.062 --> 13:47.026
Yes, getting a shirt
for Alannah.

13:47.028 --> 13:48.793
I see!

13:48.795 --> 13:50.894
- What about you?
- Post office.

13:50.896 --> 13:52.494
- Mam, can we get a treat?
- No.

13:52.496 --> 13:55.393
- Please?
- Dad, can we get a treat?

13:55.395 --> 13:57.060
I tell you what. We have
some chocolate bars at home

13:57.062 --> 13:58.426
if you'd like one.

13:58.428 --> 14:01.361
- Sorry, is that okay?
- Yeah, of course.

14:01.363 --> 14:02.759
What do you say, guys?

14:02.761 --> 14:04.127
What kind of chocolate bars?

14:04.129 --> 14:06.726
And did you complain
to the manager?

14:06.728 --> 14:08.727
Yeah, absolutely.

14:08.729 --> 14:10.194
I mean, I'm not the type
that normally would,

14:10.196 --> 14:13.160
but this woman was
fucking obnoxious, Yvonne.

14:13.162 --> 14:15.860
- No, she sounds it, all right.
- And in front of my kids?

14:15.862 --> 14:17.760
No, I mean, there's a limit

14:17.762 --> 14:20.894
to the amount of that kind of
shit you can tolerate, you know?

14:20.896 --> 14:22.027
Anyway...

14:22.029 --> 14:24.261
Dad!

14:24.263 --> 14:27.194
- Yeah?
- Look at this.

14:27.196 --> 14:29.429
All right, hang on.

14:38.229 --> 14:39.296
Cool!

14:43.195 --> 14:45.227
Do you ever notice how
once you start measuring time

14:45.229 --> 14:46.727
by the age of your kids...

14:46.729 --> 14:49.027
What, how quickly
it seems to be passing?

14:49.029 --> 14:50.060
Yeah.

14:50.062 --> 14:52.394
Oh, yeah, definitely.

14:52.396 --> 14:53.994
I mean,
just looking at Ben there,

14:53.996 --> 14:56.959
I remember him being
six or seven months old,

14:56.961 --> 14:59.727
and me cleaning his shit
and thinking,

14:59.729 --> 15:00.959
"When is he gonna
be old enough

15:00.961 --> 15:02.160
I don't have to do this
anymore?"

15:02.162 --> 15:03.727
- And then...
- Gone.

15:03.729 --> 15:05.960
Like that.
I mean, eight, nine years...

15:05.962 --> 15:07.960
- And you're that much older.
- That's right.

15:07.962 --> 15:10.360
- That's the scary thing.
- Well, that's what I'm saying.

15:10.362 --> 15:13.426
Before we had kids, it seemed
to go by so much more slowly.

15:13.428 --> 15:15.494
And now it's like,
"What the fuck?"

15:15.496 --> 15:17.361
- I know.
- What happened?

15:17.363 --> 15:19.361
I'll tell you
what I find weird, will I?

15:19.363 --> 15:22.161
Whenever I look at photographs
of the girls,

15:22.163 --> 15:24.194
like when they were younger,

15:24.196 --> 15:26.960
I kind of don't remember them
ever looking like that.

15:26.962 --> 15:28.960
What do you mean?

15:28.962 --> 15:30.927
I mean, in my head,

15:30.929 --> 15:32.827
it seems like they've always
looked exactly like

15:32.829 --> 15:34.760
they look right now,
you know?

15:34.762 --> 15:37.896
Those younger kids are
different people altogether.

15:40.329 --> 15:42.794
Or is that just me?

15:44.263 --> 15:45.427
It might be just you.

15:45.429 --> 15:46.961
Oh, right, fair enough, so...

15:51.829 --> 15:54.793
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

15:54.795 --> 15:58.960
I actually meant to say this
last time you were here.

15:58.962 --> 16:02.127
Will you not judge Chris
for that night at your house?

16:02.129 --> 16:04.060
At my... Oh, no, of course.

16:04.062 --> 16:05.994
It just I don't want
you thinking

16:05.996 --> 16:07.726
or Danielle or anyone,
actually,

16:07.728 --> 16:09.859
thinking that kind of thing
is a common occurrence.

16:09.861 --> 16:12.161
- Okay.
- Because it's not.

16:12.163 --> 16:14.727
Or that we're having problems,
say, or...

16:14.729 --> 16:15.894
Right, no, I get you.

16:15.896 --> 16:17.960
- Do you?
- Absolutely.

16:17.962 --> 16:21.994
Because, I mean,
Chris is a really gentle guy,

16:21.996 --> 16:23.426
a respectful guy.

16:23.428 --> 16:26.827
We love each other an awful lot,
Jim, you know?

16:26.829 --> 16:29.261
I mean, how are
you and Danielle?

16:29.263 --> 16:30.792
Yeah, we're good.

16:30.794 --> 16:32.327
But you know how it is,
though.

16:32.329 --> 16:34.261
- We all have our moments.
- We do.

16:34.263 --> 16:36.993
I mean, don't we?
I mean, does Danielle?

16:36.995 --> 16:39.494
She does.
No, she does.

16:39.496 --> 16:43.093
- Well, there you go, you know?
- Exactly.

16:43.095 --> 16:44.662
There you go.

16:50.862 --> 16:52.760
<i>I'm sure
there are plenty of you</i>

16:52.762 --> 16:56.261
<i>whom my advice would be to
get booking as soon as you can.</i>

16:56.263 --> 16:58.826
<i>We're gonna turn
the clocks back now,</i>

16:58.828 --> 17:00.993
<i>and go back, I think,</i>

17:00.995 --> 17:03.993
<i>something even more
sedating now.</i>

17:10.163 --> 17:13.060
Oh, man.
This brings back memories.

17:13.061 --> 17:14.729
What of?

17:16.262 --> 17:17.894
Ah...

17:20.828 --> 17:21.794
Tell me.

17:24.861 --> 17:25.961
Nothing.

17:27.829 --> 17:31.461
There was this girl I used
to know in secondary school.

17:31.463 --> 17:33.195
Samantha Nolan.

17:37.295 --> 17:38.829
Really?

17:41.396 --> 17:43.161
I was just...

17:43.163 --> 17:46.994
There was this one night
at a disco,

17:46.996 --> 17:48.494
and she asked me up to dance.

17:48.496 --> 17:51.494
This is the song
that was playing.

17:51.496 --> 17:55.860
I was always mooning
over her, so...

17:55.862 --> 17:57.994
She must have taken pity on me
or something.

17:57.996 --> 18:00.226
Did she not just like you?

18:00.228 --> 18:02.793
Nah. She was a couple of years
ahead of me,

18:02.795 --> 18:05.163
so she was
way out of my league.

18:06.761 --> 18:08.759
I tried to hang out with her
afterwards.

18:08.761 --> 18:10.427
She wasn't having any of it.

18:10.429 --> 18:13.026
So it was a sympathy dance.

18:13.028 --> 18:14.327
I suppose.

18:14.329 --> 18:17.227
Or a consolation one
or whatever.

18:20.429 --> 18:22.494
Better than nothing though.

18:22.496 --> 18:24.161
Mm.

18:47.062 --> 18:48.860
Hey, guys.

18:48.862 --> 18:51.326
<i>Different kinds of flowers.</i>

18:51.328 --> 18:53.060
<i>Like what?</i>

18:53.062 --> 18:55.759
- <i>Well, like roses.</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

18:55.761 --> 18:57.127
<i>Like...</i>

18:57.129 --> 19:00.893
He was looking in the drawer
for something,

19:00.895 --> 19:03.959
and the press above him
was open,

19:03.961 --> 19:06.827
so when he straightened up,
he banged his head off it.

19:06.829 --> 19:08.193
Right.

19:08.195 --> 19:11.160
- And I laughed.
- You laughed?

19:11.162 --> 19:16.294
Well, I didn't mean to.
It just, you know...

19:16.296 --> 19:18.229
It kinda came out.

19:20.929 --> 19:26.060
But he got so fucking angry,
Danielle.

19:26.062 --> 19:28.095
And that's when he did it.

19:32.061 --> 19:34.427
Were the girls there?

19:34.429 --> 19:36.695
No, they were in bed,
thank God.

19:38.462 --> 19:42.962
I mean, I didn't realize he was
hurt that badly, you know?

19:45.396 --> 19:48.229
- But to fucking hit me?
- I know.

19:49.861 --> 19:51.494
I mean, fuck!

19:51.496 --> 19:53.329
It's all right.

19:57.996 --> 20:00.729
I don't know
why he's acting this way.

20:03.795 --> 20:05.227
I don't.

20:05.229 --> 20:08.096
It's okay.
It's all right, Yvonne.

20:09.495 --> 20:11.129
It's okay.

20:15.129 --> 20:16.792
- Done?
- Yeah.

20:16.794 --> 20:18.926
I put the navy sheet
onto the bigger bed though.

20:18.928 --> 20:20.394
- Did it fit?
- Yeah.

20:20.396 --> 20:22.394
Oh, good. I thought it
might've been too small.

20:22.396 --> 20:25.160
Thanks, Jim. I'll take them up
in a couple of minutes.

20:25.162 --> 20:26.860
No problem.

20:26.862 --> 20:28.493
No glass for me?

20:28.495 --> 20:30.894
Yvonne has something to ask you.

20:30.896 --> 20:32.860
I'm sorry, Jim. It's just...

20:32.862 --> 20:35.060
I was thinking about the girls
and school tomorrow.

20:35.062 --> 20:37.327
I don't have their uniforms,
I don't have their bags.

20:37.329 --> 20:39.060
Oh, right.
Do you want me to get them?

20:39.062 --> 20:40.792
Could you?
I know it's a pain.

20:40.794 --> 20:42.327
No, that's fine.
Sure, I'll go down now.

20:42.329 --> 20:44.894
- Be careful though, won't you?
- What do you mean?

20:44.896 --> 20:46.927
Well, don't get into a fight.

20:46.929 --> 20:49.226
Gimme a break.

20:49.228 --> 20:51.228
So do you want to write me
a list or something?

21:06.995 --> 21:08.162
Hey.

21:11.061 --> 21:13.695
And how long did you feel it?

21:17.462 --> 21:19.727
I don't know. Two years?

21:19.729 --> 21:23.161
You left it two fucking years?

21:23.163 --> 21:24.759
I didn't want to know
if I had it.

21:24.761 --> 21:26.294
I didn't want to know.

21:26.296 --> 21:29.394
I thought if I did,
I'd rather find out too late

21:29.396 --> 21:31.126
and just accept my fate,

21:31.128 --> 21:35.059
rather of having to go through
all the fighting.

21:35.061 --> 21:36.727
The fighting?

21:36.729 --> 21:38.760
Exactly.

21:38.762 --> 21:39.962
What do you mean?

21:42.762 --> 21:45.129
- For my life.
- Oh.

21:49.728 --> 21:53.361
Anyway,
since I discovered that

21:53.363 --> 21:55.760
that's exactly what
I've succeeded in doing.

21:55.762 --> 22:00.226
I've been a bit,
as you can imagine...

22:00.228 --> 22:02.795
- Yeah.
- a bit temperamental.

22:04.829 --> 22:06.428
Hence tonight.

22:09.996 --> 22:12.263
Maybe a little bit more
than a bit.

22:19.396 --> 22:21.095
How is she?

22:22.729 --> 22:24.293
I don't know. She's upset.

22:24.295 --> 22:25.862
And the girls?

22:27.262 --> 22:28.994
You have to tell them, Chris.

22:28.996 --> 22:32.894
I know I do, but...

22:32.896 --> 22:35.060
they're just babies, Jim.

22:35.062 --> 22:36.361
And Yvonne, you know,

22:36.363 --> 22:38.826
how the fuck
am I supposed to do it?

22:38.828 --> 22:40.893
How am I supposed to destroy
their lives, you know?

22:40.895 --> 22:43.263
What fucking words...

22:45.396 --> 22:46.928
do I use?

22:55.996 --> 22:57.760
You're not to say anything
either.

22:57.762 --> 23:02.227
- Jesus, I wouldn't presume to.
- Promise though.

23:02.229 --> 23:04.361
- Promise?
- Yeah.

23:04.363 --> 23:05.993
Okay, I promise.

23:05.995 --> 23:09.160
Not even to Danielle, right?

23:09.162 --> 23:12.995
When the time is right,
I'll, uh...

23:18.462 --> 23:20.129
I'll do it.

23:49.129 --> 23:50.759
Hi.

23:50.761 --> 23:52.261
Hey.

23:52.263 --> 23:53.726
Are they gone?

23:53.728 --> 23:56.161
Yeah, Danielle took them.

23:56.163 --> 23:58.126
Why didn't she wake me?

23:58.128 --> 24:00.995
She said she thought
you might need the lie-in.

24:02.896 --> 24:04.193
Do you want some breakfast?

24:04.195 --> 24:05.293
No, I'm okay.

24:05.295 --> 24:06.760
Some coffee?

24:06.762 --> 24:08.060
You're working.

24:08.062 --> 24:10.362
You know what?
I actually need a break.

24:13.029 --> 24:14.861
Okay.

24:27.929 --> 24:29.860
This is weird.

24:29.862 --> 24:30.860
What is?

24:30.862 --> 24:33.927
Us being here alone.

24:33.929 --> 24:35.927
Oh.

24:35.929 --> 24:37.896
Without any kids.

24:39.861 --> 24:42.094
Feels slightly improper
or something, does it?

24:45.296 --> 24:47.993
A little bit?

24:47.995 --> 24:51.960
Uh, maybe now that you've drawn
my attention to it.

24:51.962 --> 24:54.260
Sorry.

24:54.262 --> 24:56.193
No, I know what you mean.

24:56.195 --> 24:59.027
If this was an Updike novel,
we'd have an affair now.

24:59.029 --> 25:00.395
Mm.

25:11.429 --> 25:13.329
Have you ever had one?

25:15.095 --> 25:16.061
What?

25:17.262 --> 25:19.927
An affair.

25:19.929 --> 25:22.962
No. No.

25:26.296 --> 25:28.327
What about you?

25:28.329 --> 25:30.296
Thinking about it.

25:32.363 --> 25:35.128
I'm joking.

25:44.428 --> 25:46.894
Why would you have an affair?

25:46.896 --> 25:48.229
I don't know.

25:49.896 --> 25:51.860
- To punish him?
- Chris.

25:51.862 --> 25:54.060
Yeah.

25:54.062 --> 25:55.229
Right.

26:00.828 --> 26:02.260
So...

26:02.262 --> 26:03.695
what happens next?

26:06.463 --> 26:08.729
Go home, I suppose.

26:10.262 --> 26:11.760
Is that stupid?

26:11.762 --> 26:14.827
No, not at all.

26:14.829 --> 26:18.027
I mean, I think
you should talk to him.

26:18.029 --> 26:19.327
Right.

26:19.329 --> 26:22.329
At the very least, you know?

26:34.729 --> 26:36.727
Would you mind terribly
if I went back up to bed

26:36.729 --> 26:38.094
for half an hour?

26:38.096 --> 26:41.161
No, not at all.
God, take as long as you need.

26:41.163 --> 26:42.962
Would you like to come with me?

26:49.363 --> 26:52.993
- Yvonne...
- Fuck. I know.

26:52.995 --> 26:55.026
- I'm sorry, Jim.
- Hang on.

26:55.028 --> 26:56.393
Danielle, my friend
and everything.

26:56.395 --> 26:58.027
Why the fuck
would I say that?

26:58.029 --> 27:00.260
- Listen...
- Jesus! I have to go, Jim.

27:00.262 --> 27:01.426
Hang on a second.

27:01.428 --> 27:03.027
Why the fuck
would I say that?

27:03.029 --> 27:04.759
- Because you're emotional.
- Christ!

27:04.761 --> 27:08.161
Listen. And upset
and whatever else. Confused.

27:08.163 --> 27:09.859
I understand, Yvonne,
all right?

27:09.861 --> 27:11.494
- I'm so fucking embarrassed.
- Don't be.

27:11.496 --> 27:13.427
And don't think... Jesus!

27:13.429 --> 27:16.260
Don't think that I haven't,
you know, thought about you

27:16.262 --> 27:17.727
in that way either.

27:17.729 --> 27:19.393
- No, you haven't.
- No, I have.

27:19.395 --> 27:21.226
You haven't.
You're only saying that

27:21.228 --> 27:22.994
to make me feel like
less of a fucking fool,

27:22.996 --> 27:24.493
and God bless you for it

27:24.495 --> 27:27.860
Look, just wait a minute.

27:27.862 --> 27:29.826
Give me your hand.

27:29.828 --> 27:32.361
Just give it to me.

27:32.363 --> 27:35.329
Do you feel how fast
that's going?

27:45.328 --> 27:46.962
Feel mine.

27:56.761 --> 27:58.429
Feel my breast.

28:00.263 --> 28:01.296
Fuck.

28:02.895 --> 28:05.327
Feel my nipple.

28:05.329 --> 28:06.762
Yvonne...

28:08.395 --> 28:10.860
I'm wet.

28:10.862 --> 28:13.161
Yvonne...

28:13.163 --> 28:16.096
Oh, God,
I'm so fucking wet.

28:24.761 --> 28:28.294
That's silly because the demon
is scared of the sword,

28:28.296 --> 28:31.494
and there's no way a demon
would be scared of a sword

28:31.496 --> 28:34.493
unless is was powered,
and it wasn't powered.

28:34.495 --> 28:36.360
It was just like
one that's metal.

28:36.362 --> 28:37.927
That is a flaw, actually.

28:37.929 --> 28:40.127
All right, coats off,
lunchboxes out of bags.

28:40.129 --> 28:41.296
Go on.

28:53.162 --> 28:55.059
Will you do my spellings
with me, Dad?

28:55.061 --> 28:59.362
Yeah, in a minute.
Just do your other jobs first.

29:12.129 --> 29:15.361
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey.

29:15.363 --> 29:17.296
- Can you talk?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

29:23.962 --> 29:24.896
Jim?

29:26.163 --> 29:28.127
Can I see you again?

29:28.129 --> 29:29.460
<i>Yes.</i>

29:29.462 --> 29:31.060
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

29:31.062 --> 29:32.361
Are you sure?

29:32.363 --> 29:34.261
I thought
you wouldn't want to.

29:34.263 --> 29:35.726
I don't.

29:35.728 --> 29:37.227
I mean, in my head,
I don't, but...

29:37.229 --> 29:39.126
<i>No, I know what you mean.</i>

29:39.128 --> 29:41.427
I've got this awful fucking knot
in my stomach all of a sudden.

29:41.429 --> 29:43.461
<i>So do I.</i>

29:43.463 --> 29:46.326
I'm not sure how much of it's
fear or how much of it's...

29:46.328 --> 29:49.193
- I don't know.
- Anticipation?

29:49.195 --> 29:51.360
<i>Yeah.</i>

29:51.362 --> 29:53.360
What if I was to rent a room
tomorrow?

29:53.362 --> 29:55.927
- A room?
- <i>In town or... Yeah.</i>

29:55.929 --> 29:57.261
I'm in work tomorrow.

29:57.263 --> 29:58.826
Well, Thursday.

29:58.828 --> 30:01.261
Would you be okay with that,
going there?

30:01.263 --> 30:02.261
No.

30:02.263 --> 30:04.327
Cool... No?

30:04.329 --> 30:07.093
I mean yes.
Yes, I'd be okay with it.

30:07.095 --> 30:08.262
<i>All right.</i>

30:12.428 --> 30:14.426
<i>I can't believe
this is happening.</i>

30:14.428 --> 30:16.228
Neither can I.

30:18.929 --> 30:20.194
I'll call you tomorrow.

30:20.196 --> 30:21.493
Okay.

30:21.495 --> 30:23.828
- <i>Bye.</i>
- Bye.

30:50.028 --> 30:52.327
And so when did she leave?

30:52.329 --> 30:54.461
Not long after.

30:54.463 --> 30:56.226
And what did she say?

30:56.228 --> 31:00.393
She said to say thanks for
getting the kids out to school.

31:00.395 --> 31:01.793
That it?

31:01.795 --> 31:04.460
I don't know.
She was quiet.

31:04.462 --> 31:07.227
I'll call her later.
You do your homework, guys?

31:07.229 --> 31:08.460
Mm-hmm.

31:08.462 --> 31:10.127
Can I leave
the rest of my beans?

31:10.129 --> 31:12.294
Ah, Ben, eat half
of what's there.

31:12.296 --> 31:13.928
Good boy.

31:16.363 --> 31:18.759
What do you think?

31:18.761 --> 31:19.926
About what?

31:19.928 --> 31:21.195
Yvonne.

31:22.496 --> 31:23.860
What do you mean?

31:39.761 --> 31:44.828
A kind of discontentment,
I suppose.

31:47.362 --> 31:49.762
Not even that. Sorry.

31:51.762 --> 31:53.695
Not even,
because I am content.

31:56.862 --> 31:59.859
It's like this...

31:59.861 --> 32:01.726
constant fucking conviction

32:01.728 --> 32:04.694
that I haven't been getting
what I deserve.

32:06.396 --> 32:09.226
That I'm undervalued.

32:09.228 --> 32:11.760
Undervalued by who?

32:11.762 --> 32:13.128
By me?

32:16.029 --> 32:18.193
By everyone.

32:18.195 --> 32:20.129
- Right.
- At work.

32:22.163 --> 32:25.296
By the fucking world.

32:26.928 --> 32:29.028
But yeah, by you as well.

32:30.761 --> 32:32.859
But you're not
undervalued by me.

32:32.861 --> 32:34.260
I know.

32:34.262 --> 32:35.893
You're valued more than you
can imagine.

32:35.895 --> 32:37.126
I know, which is why
what I did to you

32:37.128 --> 32:38.960
is so fucking
unforgivable.

32:38.962 --> 32:40.960
- Chris...
- It is, Yvonne.

32:40.962 --> 32:42.860
And to come home this evening,

32:42.862 --> 32:48.060
because I was fully expecting
the house to be empty,

32:48.062 --> 32:50.761
and that's exactly
what I fucking deserve.

32:52.263 --> 32:54.227
Of course it is.

32:54.229 --> 32:57.361
And to open the door

32:57.363 --> 33:02.894
and see their coats
and their schoolbags

33:02.896 --> 33:04.829
in the hall...

33:46.195 --> 33:47.995
I need you.

33:52.061 --> 33:53.328
I need you.

33:54.729 --> 33:56.829
- I know.
- I need you.

33:58.996 --> 34:02.027
I'm such a fucking prick.

34:02.029 --> 34:04.194
- You're not.
- An idiot.

34:04.196 --> 34:06.859
Fucking hitting you?

34:09.263 --> 34:11.293
Shh.

34:11.295 --> 34:13.728
I'm a fucking scumbag!

34:32.161 --> 34:34.094
Do you wanna leave it?

34:38.228 --> 34:39.362
Jim.

34:47.362 --> 34:49.029
Do you?

34:50.928 --> 34:52.163
No.

34:56.496 --> 34:58.228
It's weird.

35:00.463 --> 35:03.262
- I'm terrified and...
- So am I.

35:04.495 --> 35:06.695
Yet we've already done it.

35:08.328 --> 35:10.493
This is the...

35:10.495 --> 35:13.661
This is the premeditated
version though.

35:14.929 --> 35:16.229
True.

35:48.195 --> 35:49.794
Jesus.

35:51.995 --> 35:53.262
I know.

35:56.929 --> 35:58.062
Come here.

36:16.228 --> 36:18.162
God, what the hell
are we like?

36:51.328 --> 36:54.161
- Hi, guys!
- Mam!

36:54.163 --> 36:56.227
- We made crystals today!
- You what?

36:56.229 --> 36:58.427
- In school.
- You made crystals?

36:58.429 --> 37:01.959
And Eleanor Donoghue got sick
all over the floor.

37:01.961 --> 37:03.362
Oh, no!

37:08.428 --> 37:10.093
I'm gonna fall off!

37:10.095 --> 37:12.195
I'm gonna fall off!
I'm gonna fall off!

37:41.928 --> 37:44.461
<i>Then after the girls and I
got back to the house,</i>

37:44.463 --> 37:46.959
<i>I had to go up to the bathroom
and masturbate.</i>

37:46.961 --> 37:50.160
- Yvonne...
- <i>I'm serious.</i>

37:50.162 --> 37:52.959
<i>That's how much
I'm aching for you.</i>

37:52.961 --> 37:54.460
Well, where the hell
are you anyway?

37:54.462 --> 37:57.293
At home. Chris is collecting
the girls from camogie.

37:57.295 --> 37:59.827
<i>Oh, right.</i>

37:59.829 --> 38:01.326
Are you aching for me?

38:01.328 --> 38:03.792
Yeah, of course.

38:03.794 --> 38:06.759
I can't believe it's Tuesday
before I get to see you again.

38:06.761 --> 38:09.493
And what'll you do
in the meantime?

38:09.495 --> 38:10.959
<i>What do you mean?</i>

38:10.961 --> 38:12.859
Well, are you gonna
masturbate?

38:12.861 --> 38:14.394
Jesus. Stop, will you?

38:14.396 --> 38:15.893
<i>Are you?</i>

38:15.895 --> 38:17.461
Yeah, probably.

38:17.463 --> 38:20.426
Who will you fantasize about
while you're doing it?

38:20.428 --> 38:22.360
Who the hell do you think?

38:22.362 --> 38:25.260
- Tell me.
- You, of course.

38:25.262 --> 38:28.861
And what'll you fantasize about
doing to me?

39:02.228 --> 39:04.361
And I so much wanted
the yellow one.

39:04.363 --> 39:05.792
Right.

39:05.794 --> 39:08.293
I thought it was
so fucking beautiful.

39:08.295 --> 39:10.860
But no.

39:10.862 --> 39:14.460
My sister got that one,
and I got the pink.

39:14.462 --> 39:16.894
And I had
such a fucking tantrum.

39:16.896 --> 39:17.927
Really?

39:17.929 --> 39:19.229
Oh, yeah.

39:20.828 --> 39:24.361
I mean, I was only six.

39:24.363 --> 39:26.859
Even now...

39:26.861 --> 39:30.059
Even with her gone
these 15 years,

39:30.061 --> 39:32.995
I still feel so guilty
about it.

39:35.395 --> 39:37.328
My poor mother.

39:42.861 --> 39:44.129
What?

39:46.995 --> 39:48.263
Nothing.

39:53.396 --> 39:54.695
You're lovely.

39:57.862 --> 39:59.695
This is lovely.

40:01.462 --> 40:02.694
What?

40:04.495 --> 40:08.327
Just being here.

40:08.329 --> 40:10.129
Just talking.

40:15.895 --> 40:18.429
I feel very close to you
these days.

40:20.128 --> 40:21.860
Is it all right to say that?

40:21.862 --> 40:24.226
Why wouldn't it be?

40:24.228 --> 40:27.060
I don't know.

40:27.062 --> 40:29.862
I feel very close to you too.

40:33.761 --> 40:37.995
What if, next time we met,
we did something risky?

40:40.028 --> 40:41.461
Like what?

40:41.463 --> 40:45.126
Like...

40:45.128 --> 40:47.793
went for a walk
on the beach.

40:47.795 --> 40:48.894
Why?

40:48.896 --> 40:49.994
To be romantic.

40:49.996 --> 40:52.362
To be romantic?

40:55.828 --> 40:58.027
But... did we not say

40:58.029 --> 41:01.361
we wouldn't let things
get beyond this room?

41:01.363 --> 41:03.993
We did.

41:03.995 --> 41:05.429
So?

41:07.162 --> 41:09.995
That's why
it'd be a risk, see?

41:12.896 --> 41:14.960
- She said I could.
- And what did her mother say?

41:14.962 --> 41:16.293
- She didn't ask her.
- Shut up.

41:16.295 --> 41:18.161
So this is all theoretical.

41:18.163 --> 41:19.426
- No.
- Until her mother's been asked,

41:19.428 --> 41:21.194
it is, love.

41:21.196 --> 41:23.294
Well, theoretically then,
would you let me stay over?

41:23.296 --> 41:26.759
What do you think? Chris.

41:26.761 --> 41:29.726
Should we not invite Danielle
and Jim down some night soon?

41:29.728 --> 41:31.226
- And Alannah and Ben?
- What, for dinner?

41:31.228 --> 41:32.959
- Yeah.
- And Alannah and Ben, Dad?

41:32.961 --> 41:35.226
- No.
- Why?

41:35.228 --> 41:36.894
I don't know.
So I can apologize

41:36.896 --> 41:40.093
for being so obnoxious
in their house that night.

41:40.095 --> 41:42.460
- And, you know.
- Right.

41:42.462 --> 41:44.960
What does "obnoxious" mean?

41:44.962 --> 41:48.327
Uh, kinda nasty.

41:48.329 --> 41:51.194
What did you do?

41:51.196 --> 41:54.260
- I was ignorant.
- You were ignorant?

41:54.262 --> 41:57.059
- Yeah.
- Of what?

41:57.061 --> 42:01.860
Of the fact that everything
isn't all about me.

42:01.862 --> 42:05.728
Something we'd all do very well
to remember occasionally.

42:07.029 --> 42:08.163
Huh?

42:11.163 --> 42:12.263
So what do you think?

42:13.895 --> 42:15.959
No, I suppose
that's fair enough.

42:15.961 --> 42:17.759
I mean, it'll be weird.

42:17.761 --> 42:19.059
Yeah.

42:19.061 --> 42:20.926
And we'll have to be,
both of us,

42:20.928 --> 42:23.727
careful not to refer to
conversations we've had.

42:23.729 --> 42:26.460
- That's true.
- Or things we've done.

42:26.462 --> 42:28.793
Like that time we had sex
in the dunes.

42:28.795 --> 42:30.393
That time we what?

42:30.395 --> 42:32.226
- Come over here for a minute.
- Where?

42:32.228 --> 42:34.393
- Just over here.
- Jim...

42:34.395 --> 42:36.027
I'm not gonna go in there
with you. You're joking.

42:36.029 --> 42:38.726
- It's the middle of winter.
- All right.

42:38.728 --> 42:41.694
"That time we had sex
in the dunes."

42:52.128 --> 42:55.160
- What?
- My legs are fucking freezing.

42:55.162 --> 42:56.493
Do you wanna stop?

42:56.495 --> 42:57.996
God, no.

43:03.196 --> 43:05.227
Jesus!

43:06.794 --> 43:07.995
Oh, God.

43:16.362 --> 43:18.894
- You all right?
- Yeah.

43:18.896 --> 43:20.460
Have nothing better to do?

43:20.462 --> 43:21.960
Than watch you get
your hole, man?

43:21.962 --> 43:23.460
No, I don't think so.

43:23.462 --> 43:26.761
Would you not keep going?
You're just deadly.

43:31.162 --> 43:32.494
Hey, give us a look at
your fanny there, missus.

43:32.496 --> 43:34.792
- Ignore them.
- Ah, come on.

43:34.794 --> 43:37.260
- You dirty fucking slapper you.
- Jim...

43:37.262 --> 43:38.762
Who said that?

43:39.862 --> 43:40.829
I did.

43:42.428 --> 43:44.395
Your mother's a dirty slapper.

43:46.828 --> 43:48.194
Say that again?

43:48.196 --> 43:50.127
- Jim...
- Look...

43:50.129 --> 43:51.396
Say it again.

43:56.761 --> 43:58.427
- No.
- Terrible, isn't it?

43:58.429 --> 44:00.760
- Jesus.
- So where did it happen?

44:00.762 --> 44:03.926
Lombard Street just around from
a place I'm doing some work for.

44:03.928 --> 44:06.059
- Were you talking?
- Just sending a text.

44:06.061 --> 44:07.827
- To me.
- To Danielle.

44:07.829 --> 44:10.226
This fella comes out of nowhere
and grabs it or tries to.

44:10.228 --> 44:12.926
As soon as he sees I won't
let go, it was like bang!

44:12.928 --> 44:14.859
- God.
- Right in the... No, I know,

44:14.861 --> 44:18.059
And off he runs down into...
You know those flats down there?

44:18.061 --> 44:19.394
And did you tell the police?

44:19.396 --> 44:21.026
His face didn't even register.

44:21.028 --> 44:22.926
I mean, if he was
sitting here at this table,

44:22.928 --> 44:24.426
I wouldn't recognize him.

44:24.428 --> 44:27.959
I would, of course,
but you know what I mean.

44:27.961 --> 44:29.894
Added to which,
I hung onto the phone.

44:29.896 --> 44:31.894
- Aren't you great?
- Fuck you.

44:31.896 --> 44:33.260
No, you did well
to hang onto it.

44:33.262 --> 44:34.929
- Didn't he?
- Absolutely.

44:45.396 --> 44:48.059
Anyway, thanks for coming,

44:48.061 --> 44:52.993
after my behavior
last time we were together.

44:52.995 --> 44:56.493
And of course,
other things that occurred.

44:56.495 --> 44:58.262
You can't ever
do it again, Chris.

45:00.129 --> 45:01.493
What?

45:01.495 --> 45:03.794
You can't ever hit her again.

45:08.995 --> 45:10.095
I know.

45:11.794 --> 45:13.226
- I mean it. Ever.
- Danielle...

45:13.228 --> 45:15.362
No, no, no, that's fine.

45:16.862 --> 45:19.293
You have to be
better than that.

45:19.295 --> 45:21.960
And I will.

45:21.962 --> 45:24.994
I will, and, see, that's...

45:24.996 --> 45:28.393
I wanted to make that promise,

45:28.395 --> 45:31.093
and to apologize to you both

45:31.095 --> 45:33.394
and to you again, Yvonne.

45:33.396 --> 45:35.093
- Chris...
- No, seriously.

45:35.095 --> 45:38.826
And for the fact
that it happened first

45:38.828 --> 45:43.493
and for the fact that you guys
had to be such a part of it all

45:43.495 --> 45:45.428
in the way that you were.

45:53.495 --> 45:54.961
Okay.

45:56.263 --> 45:57.361
Is that okay?

45:57.363 --> 46:00.059
That's fine.

46:00.061 --> 46:01.362
All right.

46:05.862 --> 46:09.260
So will we move on to something
less, I don't know, awkward now?

46:09.262 --> 46:10.260
Absolutely.

46:10.262 --> 46:11.428
Good idea.

46:33.962 --> 46:35.960
Hey, listen, um...

46:35.962 --> 46:39.326
I wanted to say
thank you for not,

46:39.328 --> 46:40.826
you know, not saying
anything about...

46:40.828 --> 46:43.261
Oh, right. No, of course.

46:43.263 --> 46:46.926
- How are you?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

46:46.928 --> 46:49.826
But how are you really?

46:49.828 --> 46:51.494
Not great.

46:51.496 --> 46:54.193
But I'm okay, okay?

46:54.195 --> 46:57.827
And... are you ever
gonna say anything?

46:57.829 --> 46:59.160
No, you know...

46:59.162 --> 47:00.994
But you know what it is?

47:00.996 --> 47:02.960
We're in a really good place
at the moment,

47:02.962 --> 47:05.360
and I just feel like
the later I leave it,

47:05.362 --> 47:09.162
the less time they'll have to
spend fucking dealing with it.

47:10.396 --> 47:13.226
But I know. I do, I do.

47:13.228 --> 47:15.826
I will tell her.
Just...

47:15.828 --> 47:21.994
Right. Well, look if you ever
want to talk again or...

47:21.996 --> 47:23.460
- I appreciate that.
- Anything.

47:23.462 --> 47:26.262
I appreciate that.
Cheers.

47:31.296 --> 47:33.361
- Anyway, I'll, uh...
- Yeah, sure, yeah.

47:33.363 --> 47:35.427
He says it himself.
He's only really productive

47:35.429 --> 47:37.893
four, five hours at the most
each day.

47:37.895 --> 47:40.026
So I'm lucky the rest
of the time he's around

47:40.028 --> 47:43.428
and willing to take care of
the responsibilities I can't.

47:46.028 --> 47:47.226
What?

47:47.228 --> 47:50.460
Nothing.
Singing your praises.

47:50.462 --> 47:53.127
No, but it is about valuing
what we have, isn't it?

47:53.129 --> 47:54.460
- Definitely.
- 'Cause that's when the rot

47:54.462 --> 47:57.227
begins to set in
in most relationships, yeah.

47:57.229 --> 47:59.494
It's like you were saying,
Chris, you know,

47:59.496 --> 48:01.260
if you start with
what you have,

48:01.262 --> 48:03.226
taking it for granted,
am I right?

48:03.228 --> 48:05.326
- What's that?
- Because you can't.

48:05.328 --> 48:08.193
Because, Jesus, we all have a
lot of shit to be thankful for.

48:08.195 --> 48:09.793
I mean, don't we?

48:09.795 --> 48:11.426
The fact that someone,
say, could get sick,

48:11.428 --> 48:13.759
or one of the children
could get sick,

48:13.761 --> 48:15.426
it can happen
to anyone though.

48:15.428 --> 48:17.859
So we just have to remind
ourselves that...

48:17.861 --> 48:20.026
Or maybe you don't.

48:20.028 --> 48:21.826
- No, maybe you do though.
- Remind yourself what?

48:21.828 --> 48:23.993
That your happiness
is fragile,

48:23.995 --> 48:26.293
and we're all just hanging onto
it by the skin of our teeth.

48:26.295 --> 48:27.893
- All right, enough.
- What?

48:27.895 --> 48:29.360
Depressing talk.

48:29.362 --> 48:31.793
I don't wanna think
about that. We're fine.

48:31.795 --> 48:34.827
- We're all fine.
- All right.

48:34.829 --> 48:36.759
We're cool, thank God.

48:36.761 --> 48:40.127
Let's just open
another bottle of wine.

48:45.961 --> 48:48.761
Dad, are you gonna be
much longer in there?

48:50.295 --> 48:52.059
- Dad.
- What?

48:52.061 --> 48:54.393
- I need to brush my teeth.
- Use the other bathroom.

48:54.395 --> 48:56.262
Isabelle's in there.

48:58.128 --> 48:59.962
Are you doing a poo?

49:01.128 --> 49:02.395
Are you doing a poo, Dad?

49:05.328 --> 49:08.229
Dad, are you doing a poo?

49:18.262 --> 49:22.894
It's kind of confusing,
I suppose,

49:22.896 --> 49:27.027
because now I find myself
reassessing whether it ever was.

49:27.029 --> 49:28.162
Right.

49:29.395 --> 49:31.694
Proper love, like.

49:33.229 --> 49:35.229
Was it something else.

49:36.961 --> 49:38.329
Like what?

49:39.895 --> 49:42.262
Convenience, maybe?

49:43.794 --> 49:46.193
I don't know.

49:46.195 --> 49:48.862
The bond we had
through the girls.

49:53.162 --> 49:57.859
You can just fall out of love
with someone though.

49:57.861 --> 49:59.229
True.

50:01.363 --> 50:04.162
Without even knowing it,
you know?

50:05.496 --> 50:08.362
Are you still in love
with Danielle?

50:14.061 --> 50:16.128
I suppose I am, yeah.

50:24.363 --> 50:26.026
What is it?

50:26.028 --> 50:28.093
Nothing.

50:28.095 --> 50:30.961
- Yvonne...
- Then why are you doing this?

50:32.162 --> 50:34.793
Why are you here with me?

50:34.795 --> 50:36.760
Because unfortunately...

50:36.762 --> 50:38.827
- Hey.
- What?

50:38.829 --> 50:39.929
Look at me.

50:48.162 --> 50:50.160
Because unfortunately,

50:50.162 --> 50:54.395
what I feel for you
is far stronger.

50:58.895 --> 51:02.962
Then what are we still doing
in this fucking hotel room?

51:06.129 --> 51:07.493
Yvonne...

51:07.495 --> 51:10.661
- Just leave it.
- I don't wanna leave it.

51:13.861 --> 51:15.794
Will you fucking talk to me,
for fuck sake?

51:27.028 --> 51:28.093
I'm sorry.

51:28.095 --> 51:29.994
For what?

51:29.996 --> 51:33.328
All along I promised myself
I wouldn't let it...

51:35.395 --> 51:39.361
But it's just sort of happened
without my noticing.

51:39.363 --> 51:40.961
What has?

51:45.095 --> 51:46.727
Yvonne...

51:46.729 --> 51:49.028
How badly I've fucking
fallen for you, Jim.

51:52.462 --> 51:55.060
And I don't wanna give you
an ultimatum.

51:55.062 --> 51:58.826
I don't, so please don't think
that's what I'm doing,

51:58.828 --> 52:01.661
but I just can't continue
like this. I'm...

52:04.162 --> 52:07.128
It's become
too fucking painful for me.

52:11.795 --> 52:13.762
So what do you wanna do?

52:15.728 --> 52:17.726
- I don't know.
- Do you wanna end it?

52:17.728 --> 52:20.426
- Do you?
- No.

52:20.428 --> 52:22.893
Me neither.

52:22.895 --> 52:27.093
You've no fucking idea how badly
I want to be with you.

52:27.095 --> 52:29.262
But not like this.

52:31.328 --> 52:33.295
I can't anymore.

52:42.328 --> 52:46.859
Uh... so what are you saying?

52:46.861 --> 52:50.327
Are you saying
that you'd walk out on Chris?

52:50.329 --> 52:52.093
Yes.

52:52.095 --> 52:56.160
- If you wanted me to, I would.
- Yvonne...

52:56.162 --> 52:58.059
If you were prepared
to do the same.

52:58.061 --> 53:00.028
Jesus.

53:04.829 --> 53:07.726
You're really putting me
on the spot here, you know that?

53:07.728 --> 53:09.096
I know.

53:10.861 --> 53:12.728
I'm sorry.

53:26.829 --> 53:30.362
The last thing I ever wanted to
do was put you on the spot.

54:32.295 --> 54:33.461
Hey.

54:33.463 --> 54:35.028
<i>Hey.</i>

54:36.495 --> 54:39.260
I didn't expect to get you.

54:39.262 --> 54:41.860
Right.

54:41.862 --> 54:44.226
I couldn't sleep.

54:44.228 --> 54:46.162
<i>No, neither could I.</i>

54:53.195 --> 54:55.126
All right.

54:55.128 --> 54:56.995
<i>All right what?</i>

54:58.995 --> 55:01.195
I am prepared to do the same.

55:03.928 --> 55:05.360
- Jim...
- <i>What?</i>

55:05.362 --> 55:07.894
Don't say it
if you don't mean it.

55:07.896 --> 55:11.027
<i>Seriously. I'd rather
end it now than...</i>

55:11.029 --> 55:13.194
I don't wanna end it now.

55:13.196 --> 55:15.828
I don't wanna end it ever.

55:17.229 --> 55:19.162
- <i>Are you sure? Because...</i>
- Yes.

55:25.228 --> 55:26.861
Well, neither do I.

55:28.295 --> 55:29.694
Okay.

55:31.962 --> 55:34.426
So are we still gonna
see each other on Thursday?

55:34.428 --> 55:37.260
- Of course.
- <i>And we'll just...</i>

55:37.262 --> 55:41.059
We'll have a proper,
more, you know,

55:41.061 --> 55:44.126
practical conversation
about all this,

55:44.128 --> 55:45.794
Okay.

55:49.262 --> 55:50.928
I love you.

55:55.095 --> 55:56.962
I love you too.

55:59.362 --> 56:01.228
See you Thursday.

56:27.462 --> 56:28.993
Hello?

56:28.995 --> 56:31.426
- <i>Mr. Ryan?</i>
- Uh, yes.

56:31.428 --> 56:34.928
This is Ms. Hynes,
Alannah's teacher.

56:36.428 --> 56:38.926
I'm so sorry.
I was at a meeting in town.

56:38.928 --> 56:40.760
- That's all right.
- The thing ran on.

56:40.762 --> 56:42.727
I just forgot
to check the time.

56:42.729 --> 56:44.759
- You okay?
- Uh-huh.

56:44.761 --> 56:46.859
Thanks so much for looking
after them, Ms. Hynes,

56:46.861 --> 56:48.260
I promise this will
never happen again.

56:48.262 --> 56:50.127
I'm sure it won't.

56:50.129 --> 56:51.792
Enjoy the rest of your day,
kids.

56:51.794 --> 56:52.926
- Bye.
- Bye.

56:52.928 --> 56:54.263
Thanks.

56:58.495 --> 57:03.093
<i>I look forward to your message.
To end, just hang up.</i>

57:04.995 --> 57:09.826
Hey. Uh, me again.

57:09.828 --> 57:13.093
Just checking to see
if everything's okay?

57:13.095 --> 57:14.959
It'd be great
to hear from you,

57:14.961 --> 57:19.926
even if it's just, you know,
a text or whatever.

57:19.928 --> 57:22.095
All right. Bye.

57:31.028 --> 57:32.460
- Are you listening?
- Yeah.

57:32.462 --> 57:35.059
And Stephanie says,
"Would Adam like to come?

57:35.061 --> 57:37.093
- Who's Adam?
- Breda's husband.

57:37.095 --> 57:39.426
And Breda says,
"I see him enough at home.

57:39.428 --> 57:41.959
Do you really think I want
to socialize with him too?"

57:41.961 --> 57:43.792
Completely serious-like.

57:43.794 --> 57:44.794
Cheers.

57:47.961 --> 57:50.026
She says they haven't had sex
in seven years.

57:50.028 --> 57:52.426
Seven? Jesus.

57:52.428 --> 57:53.493
I know.

57:53.495 --> 57:57.326
Which kind of got me thinking.

57:57.328 --> 57:58.728
What's this?

57:59.962 --> 58:02.062
I haven't a clue.

58:08.329 --> 58:10.826
It's kinda got you
thinking what?

58:10.828 --> 58:13.494
Well, we could probably do
with keeping a bit of an eye

58:13.496 --> 58:15.360
on our own
relationship lately.

58:15.362 --> 58:17.859
What do you mean?

58:17.861 --> 58:22.093
Well, do you know when we were
last out on a date, for example?

58:22.095 --> 58:23.260
When?

58:23.262 --> 58:25.759
That play we saw.

58:25.761 --> 58:27.226
- Really?
- Yeah,

58:27.228 --> 58:29.127
I mean, that was a couple
of months ago now.

58:29.129 --> 58:30.792
Do you know when we
last had sex?

58:30.794 --> 58:33.493
- Um...
- No?

58:33.495 --> 58:35.427
It was that same night.

58:35.429 --> 58:36.861
Okay.

58:38.228 --> 58:40.193
And does that
not bother you?

58:40.195 --> 58:42.859
Yeah,

58:42.861 --> 58:45.827
I haven't seen you,
you know...

58:45.829 --> 58:47.393
instigate anything either.

58:47.395 --> 58:49.960
And I accept that.
God, I'm not blaming you, Jim.

58:49.962 --> 58:52.826
We've both so busy lately,
it's hardly surprising.

58:52.828 --> 58:55.759
I'm just... you know?

58:55.761 --> 58:57.261
I'm just saying,
the flames of our marriage

58:57.263 --> 59:00.160
could do with
a bit of fanning lately.

59:00.162 --> 59:01.859
That's all.

59:01.861 --> 59:03.295
A bit of fanning?

59:04.362 --> 59:05.861
Yeah.

59:07.395 --> 59:09.428
What do you propose?

59:16.828 --> 59:18.694
What the fuck?

59:21.895 --> 59:25.026
And he said to apologize,
but he just...

59:25.028 --> 59:27.260
- For not coming up?
- Yeah.

59:27.262 --> 59:30.426
Oh, God, there's no need,
Yvonne.

59:30.428 --> 59:34.028
He's just so many people
to tell himself, you know?

59:37.128 --> 59:39.393
And is there anything
we can do?

59:39.395 --> 59:42.160
At all?

59:42.162 --> 59:45.426
I mean, God, you hear about
this kind of thing, but...

59:45.428 --> 59:46.993
- Don't you?
- Hmm.

59:46.995 --> 59:49.128
But then it happens and...

59:50.928 --> 59:53.162
I don't know what to say,
Yvonne.

01:00:07.828 --> 01:00:09.162
And will I...

01:00:11.228 --> 01:00:12.428
What?

01:00:15.228 --> 01:00:17.162
Will I get to see you?

01:00:19.328 --> 01:00:21.226
Jim...

01:00:21.228 --> 01:00:22.793
No?

01:00:22.795 --> 01:00:25.961
I can't even
think about this anymore.

01:00:29.295 --> 01:00:31.893
I know.

01:00:31.895 --> 01:00:34.293
- He needs me.
- Right.

01:00:34.295 --> 01:00:36.226
- The girls...
- I know. I know.

01:00:36.228 --> 01:00:38.128
They need me.

01:00:39.228 --> 01:00:41.228
And so this is it.

01:00:42.895 --> 01:00:45.262
This is where it has to end.

01:00:51.428 --> 01:00:53.460
And what about after?

01:00:53.462 --> 01:00:55.295
After what?

01:00:57.295 --> 01:00:59.294
Jim...

01:00:59.296 --> 01:01:01.361
- I'm sorry.
- Jim...

01:01:01.363 --> 01:01:03.195
I know. I'm sorry.

01:01:11.128 --> 01:01:13.393
I have to go.

01:01:13.395 --> 01:01:14.929
Okay.

01:01:25.362 --> 01:01:26.928
I'll see you.

01:01:27.995 --> 01:01:29.661
I'll see you.

01:01:51.228 --> 01:01:52.859
- Ten out of ten.
- Uh-huh.

01:01:52.861 --> 01:01:55.026
Aw. It's beautiful, darling.

01:01:55.028 --> 01:01:57.059
- I didn't win though.
- What?

01:01:57.061 --> 01:01:58.426
Joseph Carney got first.

01:01:58.428 --> 01:02:00.393
- And did he get ten out of ten?
- Mm-hmm.

01:02:00.395 --> 01:02:01.893
Well, that's not fair.

01:02:01.895 --> 01:02:03.893
She should have let you
share first place.

01:02:03.895 --> 01:02:06.360
Maybe she was annoyed at you
'cause of having to mind us.

01:02:06.362 --> 01:02:08.059
When did she have to mind you?

01:02:08.061 --> 01:02:10.293
The other day
when Dad was late.

01:02:10.295 --> 01:02:11.893
Picking you up?

01:02:11.895 --> 01:02:13.393
Yeah, I don't know
what the hell happened.

01:02:13.395 --> 01:02:14.759
How late were you?

01:02:14.761 --> 01:02:16.959
- About an hour.
- Ah, Jim.

01:02:16.961 --> 01:02:20.093
I know, I just... I laid down
inside for 15 minutes,

01:02:20.095 --> 01:02:23.026
just to rest my eyes, like,
and when I opened them.

01:02:23.028 --> 01:02:25.893
That's not what you told
Ms. Hynes, Dad.

01:02:25.895 --> 01:02:28.460
- What?
- You told her you were in town.

01:02:28.462 --> 01:02:32.160
- No, I didn't.
- At a meeting. You did.

01:02:32.162 --> 01:02:35.959
Oh, no, you're right.
That's right.

01:02:35.961 --> 01:02:37.926
That's because I was
kind of embarrassed

01:02:37.928 --> 01:02:39.893
about having had a nap
in the first place.

01:02:39.895 --> 01:02:41.326
Why would you be embarrassed?

01:02:41.328 --> 01:02:43.993
I don't know.
In case she thought I was lazy.

01:02:43.995 --> 01:02:45.926
- That's silly.
- So you lied.

01:02:45.928 --> 01:02:47.393
Well, it was a white one
though, wasn't it?

01:02:47.395 --> 01:02:49.260
- Still.
- I know, but...

01:02:49.262 --> 01:02:52.262
- Still, Dad.
- I know, I know. I know.

01:02:57.162 --> 01:02:58.162
Ready?

01:03:05.794 --> 01:03:07.360
Dad?

01:03:07.362 --> 01:03:09.028
Mam wants you.

01:03:13.762 --> 01:03:15.293
What's up?

01:03:15.295 --> 01:03:18.193
What's your code?

01:03:18.195 --> 01:03:20.226
What code?

01:03:20.228 --> 01:03:21.428
To your phone.

01:03:24.228 --> 01:03:27.059
Why do you wanna know?

01:03:27.061 --> 01:03:29.193
'Cause I need to
make sure of something.

01:03:29.195 --> 01:03:30.959
What?

01:03:30.961 --> 01:03:34.993
That you're not up to something
I think you might be.

01:03:34.995 --> 01:03:36.828
Like what?

01:03:40.095 --> 01:03:42.028
Something like what?

01:03:44.162 --> 01:03:46.993
Like cheating on me.

01:03:46.995 --> 01:03:50.493
- Cheating on you?
- Mm-hmm.

01:03:50.495 --> 01:03:53.160
What the hell are you
talking about?

01:03:53.162 --> 01:03:54.726
Are you?

01:03:54.728 --> 01:03:56.959
Of course not.
What the fuck?

01:03:56.961 --> 01:03:59.028
So what's the code then?

01:04:05.995 --> 01:04:08.961
- I'm not gonna tell you.
- Why not?

01:04:13.328 --> 01:04:15.859
Because it's private and because
what you're saying is nonsense.

01:04:15.861 --> 01:04:18.393
You really aren't allaying
my suspicions, Jim,

01:04:18.395 --> 01:04:20.093
do you know that?

01:04:20.095 --> 01:04:23.028
Why the hell do you think
I'm cheating on you?

01:04:26.462 --> 01:04:29.059
- I just do.
- You just do?

01:04:29.061 --> 01:04:30.193
That's right.

01:04:30.195 --> 01:04:32.093
Well, I'm not, Danielle.

01:04:32.095 --> 01:04:34.126
So what's in the phone
you don't want me to see then?

01:04:34.128 --> 01:04:35.792
Nothing.

01:04:35.794 --> 01:04:39.126
So why won't you give me
the fucking code then?

01:04:39.128 --> 01:04:41.792
Why won't you give to me?

01:04:41.794 --> 01:04:44.128
The fuck are you up to, Jim?

01:05:03.928 --> 01:05:05.895
- I was.
- Huh?

01:05:09.328 --> 01:05:12.226
I was seeing someone,
but I'm not anymore.

01:05:12.228 --> 01:05:14.993
This isn't fucking happening.

01:05:14.995 --> 01:05:16.193
Who is she?

01:05:16.195 --> 01:05:18.160
- <i>Was</i> she.
- Huh?

01:05:18.162 --> 01:05:21.395
- I told you, I'm not seeing...
- Jesus, who was she then?

01:05:26.028 --> 01:05:29.759
A girl who works with
a friend of Gary Mulhern.

01:05:29.761 --> 01:05:30.926
You wouldn't know her.

01:05:30.928 --> 01:05:32.828
A younger girl?

01:05:38.195 --> 01:05:39.895
A younger girl.

01:05:41.462 --> 01:05:44.759
You pathetic fuck!

01:05:44.761 --> 01:05:47.260
You're a fucking cliché,
do you know that?

01:05:47.262 --> 01:05:49.127
Jesus Christ.

01:05:52.362 --> 01:05:54.926
And how long were you
seeing her for?

01:05:54.928 --> 01:05:56.859
- Actually, no.
- A few weeks.

01:05:56.861 --> 01:05:59.059
You know what?
I don't wanna know.

01:05:59.061 --> 01:06:01.360
I want you to just
get what you need and to go.

01:06:01.362 --> 01:06:03.759
- Danielle...
- Now, please!

01:06:05.828 --> 01:06:07.892
Where am I supposed to go?

01:06:07.894 --> 01:06:10.426
What the fuck do I care?
To her!

01:06:10.428 --> 01:06:12.260
- To her?
- To hell!

01:06:12.262 --> 01:06:14.959
Who gives a fuck,
as long as it's out of here!

01:06:14.961 --> 01:06:16.895
As long as I don't have to...

01:06:19.495 --> 01:06:21.961
to fucking look at you!

01:06:57.195 --> 01:07:00.126
This is when they
contradicted him. Okay.

01:07:00.128 --> 01:07:03.226
There was the briefest moment of
panic in his face, and I just...

01:07:03.228 --> 01:07:05.426
- My heart stopped beating.
- 'Cause you knew.

01:07:05.428 --> 01:07:06.893
'Cause I fucking knew,
you know?

01:07:06.895 --> 01:07:08.361
Wow.

01:07:10.328 --> 01:07:12.026
And you're actually gonna
go through with it?

01:07:12.028 --> 01:07:15.026
Yeah, well...
What do you mean?

01:07:15.028 --> 01:07:17.993
Well, you're not just,
I don't know, punishing him.

01:07:17.995 --> 01:07:19.825
No. God, no.

01:07:19.827 --> 01:07:23.193
It's over, Yvonne. I mean...

01:07:23.195 --> 01:07:25.160
Do you need to get that?

01:07:25.162 --> 01:07:26.328
Oh.

01:07:31.061 --> 01:07:33.726
- No, it's fine, go on.
- We're finished.

01:07:33.728 --> 01:07:35.193
Okay.

01:07:35.195 --> 01:07:37.226
I think even
he understands that now.

01:07:37.228 --> 01:07:39.726
And who was she?

01:07:39.728 --> 01:07:43.360
I don't know. Some woman that
works with a friend of his.

01:07:43.362 --> 01:07:45.193
- A younger model, of course.
- Oh, no.

01:07:45.195 --> 01:07:46.826
So fucking predictable.

01:07:46.828 --> 01:07:48.326
- How much younger?
- I didn't ask.

01:07:48.328 --> 01:07:49.993
- Really?
- No.

01:07:49.995 --> 01:07:51.959
Well, the fact of it
hurts enough

01:07:51.961 --> 01:07:53.926
without having to know
those fucking details.

01:07:53.928 --> 01:07:55.426
- How firm were her breasts.
- Right.

01:07:55.428 --> 01:07:57.026
What kind of contortions
was she capable of.

01:07:57.028 --> 01:07:59.293
Fuck that.

01:07:59.295 --> 01:08:01.328
I'm past it, Yvonne.

01:08:03.728 --> 01:08:04.893
Why? Would you?

01:08:04.895 --> 01:08:07.128
- Want to know?
- Yeah.

01:08:08.827 --> 01:08:10.894
No, probably not.

01:08:15.428 --> 01:08:16.661
What?

01:08:18.194 --> 01:08:20.759
We're both gonna be alone.

01:08:20.761 --> 01:08:23.826
- Oh, God, I'm sorry, Yvonne.
- What?

01:08:23.828 --> 01:08:25.426
As if my problems are anything
compared to yours.

01:08:25.428 --> 01:08:27.861
- Stop.
- No, but it's true.

01:08:29.428 --> 01:08:31.292
How is he?

01:08:31.295 --> 01:08:34.059
He's coping.

01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:35.957
And how are you doing?

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:39.026
Yeah, for the moment,
I am too.

01:08:39.028 --> 01:08:41.026
I mean, at this point,
it's just about

01:08:41.028 --> 01:08:45.060
squeezing the last few drops out
of the little time we've left.

01:08:48.095 --> 01:08:50.059
You wanna say hello?

01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:52.193
Okay.

01:08:52.194 --> 01:08:54.093
Here, try that wee one.

01:08:54.095 --> 01:08:56.859
Is it going in?

01:08:56.861 --> 01:08:58.826
- Hi.
- Hey. How are you?

01:08:58.828 --> 01:09:01.393
- Okay. How are you?
- Yeah, good, thanks.

01:09:01.395 --> 01:09:04.091
- We'll see.
- That's good.

01:09:04.094 --> 01:09:05.225
Just doing a bit of gardening.

01:09:05.228 --> 01:09:08.026
Hey, girls, how are you doing?

01:09:08.028 --> 01:09:10.393
<i>Hey, um...</i>

01:09:10.395 --> 01:09:14.292
<i>I just wanna say
I hope Chris is doing okay.</i>

01:09:14.295 --> 01:09:17.026
<i>I mean, given the...</i>

01:09:17.028 --> 01:09:21.260
<i>Anyway, I know I'm being
a bit, um, persistent,</i>

01:09:21.261 --> 01:09:25.126
<i>but I'd love to talk at some
point, if you get a minute.</i>

01:09:25.127 --> 01:09:27.725
<i>I can meet you anywhere
for however long</i>

01:09:27.728 --> 01:09:29.728
<i>at whatever time.</i>

01:09:34.261 --> 01:09:35.761
<i>I miss you.</i>

01:09:39.861 --> 01:09:42.292
You know Karen.
She'd be going on about,

01:09:42.295 --> 01:09:45.026
"Did I make the right decision
not having kids?"

01:09:45.028 --> 01:09:46.993
With having had the girls
this last few weeks,

01:09:46.995 --> 01:09:52.093
I'd say she feels... not that
they haven't been well-behaved...

01:09:52.095 --> 01:09:54.493
but that she probably
made the right decision.

01:09:56.428 --> 01:09:59.193
Hmm.

01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:01.162
She doesn't know
what she's missing, does she?

01:10:13.128 --> 01:10:16.360
Did you ever cheat on me, Chris?

01:10:16.362 --> 01:10:18.460
What?

01:10:18.462 --> 01:10:19.961
Did you?

01:10:27.228 --> 01:10:28.761
I kissed someone once.

01:10:30.228 --> 01:10:31.328
Who?

01:10:34.262 --> 01:10:36.128
Laura McCabe.

01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:40.826
That time you were
in Birmingham?

01:10:40.828 --> 01:10:42.060
Yeah.

01:10:45.362 --> 01:10:46.928
Okay.

01:10:48.861 --> 01:10:51.492
I almost went to her room
with her too.

01:10:51.494 --> 01:10:53.162
But you didn't.

01:10:54.828 --> 01:10:56.093
No.

01:10:56.095 --> 01:10:57.661
Why not?

01:11:00.061 --> 01:11:02.128
Came to my senses.

01:11:05.995 --> 01:11:08.059
I'm sorry, Yvonne.

01:11:08.061 --> 01:11:09.393
That's okay.

01:11:09.395 --> 01:11:11.028
It's not.

01:11:13.327 --> 01:11:18.061
I even bought fucking condoms
in the toilets.

01:11:21.061 --> 01:11:25.093
- Will you forgive me?
- What about other times?

01:11:25.095 --> 01:11:26.629
There were none.

01:11:30.228 --> 01:11:32.094
Will you forgive me?

01:11:33.861 --> 01:11:35.227
Yes.

01:11:38.761 --> 01:11:40.195
Thank you.

01:11:44.295 --> 01:11:45.826
I'm glad you asked.

01:11:45.828 --> 01:11:47.193
- You're glad?
- Yeah.

01:11:47.195 --> 01:11:49.260
Why?

01:11:49.262 --> 01:11:51.792
I suppose it matters,
all of a sudden,

01:11:51.794 --> 01:11:53.792
how you remember me.

01:11:53.794 --> 01:11:58.460
Not that you'll
think well of me.

01:11:58.462 --> 01:12:02.026
You'll think what you want,
I suppose,

01:12:02.028 --> 01:12:04.425
but that you have no...

01:12:04.427 --> 01:12:07.393
questions about to who I was.

01:12:07.395 --> 01:12:08.759
Uh-huh.

01:12:08.761 --> 01:12:11.493
Or what I thought or felt.

01:12:11.495 --> 01:12:12.758
Okay.

01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:14.295
Deep down.

01:12:25.428 --> 01:12:28.694
It's weird, you know.
I don't fell bitter at all.

01:12:29.794 --> 01:12:31.160
What do you mean?

01:12:31.162 --> 01:12:32.128
About this.

01:12:34.428 --> 01:12:36.426
There are people...
Jesus...

01:12:36.428 --> 01:12:39.426
children who don't
even get to grow up.

01:12:39.428 --> 01:12:41.460
Kids I went to school with

01:12:41.462 --> 01:12:43.959
who never made it
out of their teens.

01:12:43.961 --> 01:12:48.259
You know, why did I deserve
more life than them?

01:12:48.261 --> 01:12:49.861
I didn't.

01:12:51.427 --> 01:12:53.028
I don't.

01:12:55.761 --> 01:13:00.993
And these last however many
years with you, Yvonne,

01:13:00.995 --> 01:13:02.894
and the girls...

01:13:04.362 --> 01:13:08.262
this whole adventure we've had,
I fuck...

01:13:13.995 --> 01:13:18.393
I really loved it all,
you know?

01:13:18.395 --> 01:13:21.260
So, no, I don't feel cheated

01:13:21.262 --> 01:13:25.661
because I really believe
I've had a generous share.

01:13:29.128 --> 01:13:31.393
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

01:13:31.395 --> 01:13:33.326
Yes.

01:13:33.328 --> 01:13:35.828
Of life, like.

01:13:37.227 --> 01:13:40.093
A generous share.

01:13:40.095 --> 01:13:41.761
And more.

01:13:46.262 --> 01:13:47.725
Don't cry.

01:13:51.428 --> 01:13:53.295
I can't help it.

01:14:12.262 --> 01:14:13.893
- Give it to me.
- In a minute.

01:14:13.895 --> 01:14:15.026
- Now!
- I'm using it.

01:14:15.028 --> 01:14:16.726
- I don't care.
- Mam.

01:14:16.728 --> 01:14:18.026
- Give me it.
- Mam!

01:14:18.028 --> 01:14:20.228
Will you give her
the bloody thing?

01:14:31.128 --> 01:14:32.459
Here.

01:14:32.461 --> 01:14:36.295
No, go on.
Just hurry up.

01:14:38.128 --> 01:14:39.195
Hey.

01:14:40.262 --> 01:14:41.326
Hey.

01:14:41.328 --> 01:14:43.393
Long time no see.

01:14:43.395 --> 01:14:44.859
Jim...

01:14:44.861 --> 01:14:46.995
Can I talk to you
just for a minute?

01:14:51.362 --> 01:14:53.359
You'll have to do it here.
The girls are inside.

01:14:53.361 --> 01:14:56.993
Okay. I'm sorry about
the phone calls, I am.

01:14:56.995 --> 01:14:59.326
I just... There's something
I need to know.

01:14:59.328 --> 01:15:01.260
What?

01:15:01.262 --> 01:15:03.760
That you're gonna
come back to me.

01:15:07.728 --> 01:15:11.058
Do you any idea
what I'm going through, Jim?

01:15:11.060 --> 01:15:12.460
- I do.
- You don't.

01:15:12.462 --> 01:15:14.460
I'm barely holding on
to my sanity,

01:15:14.462 --> 01:15:16.160
- and you're demanding to know...
- I am.

01:15:16.162 --> 01:15:17.826
If you're gonna be with me
after he's gone.

01:15:17.828 --> 01:15:19.859
- After he's gone?
- Yes!

01:15:19.861 --> 01:15:21.993
Do you have any idea how fucking
insensitive you're being?

01:15:21.995 --> 01:15:23.360
- Yvonne...
- How selfish?

01:15:23.362 --> 01:15:24.993
- I love you.
- Right.

01:15:24.995 --> 01:15:27.825
I do, and...
What the hell does that mean?

01:15:27.827 --> 01:15:29.059
- What does what mean?
- "Right".

01:15:29.061 --> 01:15:30.360
- It means "I see."
- You see?

01:15:30.362 --> 01:15:32.160
That's right!

01:15:32.162 --> 01:15:33.826
You say that as if
it's something you didn't know.

01:15:33.828 --> 01:15:35.493
Let me ask you something.

01:15:35.495 --> 01:15:37.026
That first time
we slept together,

01:15:37.028 --> 01:15:38.426
did you know
my husband was dying?

01:15:38.428 --> 01:15:40.026
What? No.

01:15:40.028 --> 01:15:42.028
You did, Jim!

01:15:44.394 --> 01:15:46.426
What the fu...
You seduced me, Yvonne.

01:15:46.428 --> 01:15:48.326
You're the one
who came on to me.

01:15:48.328 --> 01:15:51.293
Out of... Yes, yes!
Out of loneliness!

01:15:51.295 --> 01:15:53.293
Confusion about my husband,
about his behavior,

01:15:53.295 --> 01:15:54.858
which would have been
less confusing

01:15:54.860 --> 01:15:56.260
had I have known
what you knew.

01:15:56.262 --> 01:15:57.893
- I promised him.
- What?

01:15:57.895 --> 01:15:59.092
I promised
I wouldn't tell you.

01:15:59.094 --> 01:16:00.393
You didn't have to fuck me.

01:16:00.395 --> 01:16:01.893
You didn't have
to beg me to fuck you.

01:16:01.895 --> 01:16:02.959
Mam?

01:16:02.961 --> 01:16:05.493
- Yes?
- Can we watch TV?

01:16:05.495 --> 01:16:08.028
Clean up your
drawing stuff first.

01:16:11.295 --> 01:16:13.926
Did you never think about
what'd happen once I found out?

01:16:13.928 --> 01:16:15.093
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

01:16:15.095 --> 01:16:16.326
No, I didn't!

01:16:16.328 --> 01:16:17.993
- What did you think about?
- You!

01:16:17.995 --> 01:16:19.460
- Me.
- Yes!

01:16:19.462 --> 01:16:21.759
And of how fucking amazing
it was to be with you.

01:16:21.761 --> 01:16:25.426
Jim, it's a terrible thing
you did.

01:16:25.428 --> 01:16:27.959
Do you even realize that?

01:16:27.961 --> 01:16:30.826
And what about you, huh?

01:16:30.828 --> 01:16:32.293
- You told me you loved me.
- Yes.

01:16:32.295 --> 01:16:34.160
- You wanted us to be together.
- Yes, I did.

01:16:34.162 --> 01:16:36.792
To destroy our fucking families.
Does he know that?

01:16:36.794 --> 01:16:39.193
- Mam, Isabelle's making me...
- Does Chris know that?

01:16:39.195 --> 01:16:41.694
Go inside, love.

01:16:43.395 --> 01:16:46.925
Please go away and
leave us alone, will you, Jim?

01:16:46.927 --> 01:16:48.995
- My children's father...
- Mam!

01:16:50.462 --> 01:16:52.460
- This is my family, Jim.
- I wanted to be...

01:16:52.462 --> 01:16:54.392
Are you deaf?

01:16:54.394 --> 01:16:55.759
Are you deaf?

01:16:55.761 --> 01:16:58.859
- Mam, who is it?
- Go inside!

01:16:58.861 --> 01:17:01.728
Please go away and
leave us alone. Please!

01:17:13.328 --> 01:17:15.262
You got me fired from my job,
you know that?

01:17:16.828 --> 01:17:17.893
Oh, Jesus.

01:17:17.895 --> 01:17:20.325
Jesus, yeah.

01:17:20.327 --> 01:17:24.260
Listen, last thing I wanna do
is have a fight, do you mind?

01:17:24.262 --> 01:17:26.293
What can I get you?

01:17:26.295 --> 01:17:30.162
Two gin and slimline tonics and
a vodka and Diet Coke, please.

01:17:32.827 --> 01:17:35.228
You got yourself fucking fired.

01:17:36.895 --> 01:17:38.260
Look, we're back
to the same fucking thing.

01:17:38.262 --> 01:17:39.759
I accept that
it wasn't your fault.

01:17:39.761 --> 01:17:41.393
- You accept it, do you?
- Yeah.

01:17:41.395 --> 01:17:43.493
- Why did you say it was?
- I didn't.

01:17:43.495 --> 01:17:46.126
All I did was point out that
the fucking chips never came.

01:17:46.128 --> 01:17:47.293
Why is that my responsibility?

01:17:47.295 --> 01:17:48.759
- It's not.
- Exactly.

01:17:48.761 --> 01:17:50.160
But you have
other responsibilities.

01:17:50.162 --> 01:17:52.993
- Like what?
- Being polite to customers.

01:17:52.995 --> 01:17:54.260
I mean, how long
were you there for?

01:17:54.262 --> 01:17:55.825
- In the job?
- Yeah.

01:17:55.827 --> 01:17:57.493
- A year.
- You lasted that fucking long?

01:17:57.495 --> 01:17:59.925
- Fuck you.
- Something you need to learn:

01:17:59.927 --> 01:18:01.493
The customer is always right.

01:18:01.495 --> 01:18:03.959
Is that right?
Even when he's an asshole?

01:18:03.961 --> 01:18:06.059
Orla, are you coming or what?

01:18:06.061 --> 01:18:08.126
Hang on a minute.
Even when he's an asshole?

01:18:08.128 --> 01:18:09.292
You saying I'm an asshole?

01:18:09.294 --> 01:18:10.959
- Yeah.
- Orla.

01:18:10.961 --> 01:18:12.726
You know what? I'm gonna
hang on another while.

01:18:12.728 --> 01:18:14.726
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:18:14.728 --> 01:18:16.260
I'll give you a shout tomorrow,
all right?

01:18:16.262 --> 01:18:18.858
- Okay.
- Yes, you're an asshole-

01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:20.426
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.

01:18:20.428 --> 01:18:22.426
Complaining to
the manager over a little...

01:18:22.428 --> 01:18:24.193
- the smallest disagreement.
- The what?

01:18:24.195 --> 01:18:26.393
Jesus, you just don't
talk to people that way.

01:18:26.395 --> 01:18:28.959
All right.
Lighten up, for God's sake.

01:18:28.961 --> 01:18:31.093
Lighten up?
See, this is the fucking...

01:18:31.095 --> 01:18:33.226
Don't say "lighten up" as if
I'm the one with the problem.

01:18:33.228 --> 01:18:35.726
- But you are though.
- No. You fucking are.

01:18:35.728 --> 01:18:37.893
All right, look,
will we leave it?

01:18:37.895 --> 01:18:40.093
- Huh?
- We leave it.

01:18:40.095 --> 01:18:42.393
If I go now,
I can catch up with my friends.

01:18:42.395 --> 01:18:44.791
Or we have another drink.

01:18:46.095 --> 01:18:48.293
Well, I'm happy to have
another drink,

01:18:48.295 --> 01:18:52.726
if only to convince you that
being contrary isn't being rude

01:18:52.728 --> 01:18:54.259
and fucking abrasive isn't...

01:18:54.261 --> 01:18:57.460
I'm not always rude
and abrasive.

01:18:57.462 --> 01:18:59.425
- No?
- No.

01:18:59.427 --> 01:19:02.326
Or contrary.

01:19:02.328 --> 01:19:04.961
Well, I fucking hope not.

01:19:07.061 --> 01:19:09.226
What is it, same again?

01:19:20.828 --> 01:19:23.792
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:19:23.794 --> 01:19:25.195
How are ya?

01:19:27.061 --> 01:19:29.095
Shit.

01:19:31.395 --> 01:19:33.393
I'm sorry I haven't been in.

01:19:33.395 --> 01:19:35.326
That's okay.

01:19:35.328 --> 01:19:37.726
It was awkward,

01:19:37.728 --> 01:19:40.293
what with what happened
with me and Yvonne

01:19:40.295 --> 01:19:41.993
or between us.

01:19:41.995 --> 01:19:43.928
Don't worry about it.

01:19:46.462 --> 01:19:49.826
I'm sorry I told her
you knew I was sick.

01:19:49.828 --> 01:19:51.826
That's all right.

01:19:51.828 --> 01:19:54.360
It just kind of came out
before I knew

01:19:54.362 --> 01:19:56.860
what the hell I was saying,
you know?

01:20:02.262 --> 01:20:04.060
What's wrong?

01:20:06.395 --> 01:20:08.093
I'm ashamed of myself.

01:20:08.095 --> 01:20:10.728
Don't be stupid,
will you not?

01:20:12.494 --> 01:20:15.193
When two people fall in love,
there isn't very much

01:20:15.195 --> 01:20:18.126
either of them can do about it,
really, is there?

01:20:18.128 --> 01:20:19.959
No.

01:20:19.961 --> 01:20:21.959
And you are in love,
aren't you?

01:20:21.961 --> 01:20:23.927
Yeah. I know I am.

01:20:25.128 --> 01:20:27.293
Now she is too.

01:20:27.295 --> 01:20:30.025
How do you know?

01:20:30.027 --> 01:20:31.328
She told me.

01:20:32.395 --> 01:20:35.392
- She told you?
- Yeah.

01:20:35.394 --> 01:20:40.126
In fact, she even went as far as
to ask my permission.

01:20:40.128 --> 01:20:43.428
As if I'll have any say
in anything when I'm gone.

01:20:46.428 --> 01:20:49.925
Permission to what?

01:20:49.927 --> 01:20:51.861
To be with you.

01:20:57.028 --> 01:20:59.493
And did you give it?

01:20:59.495 --> 01:21:01.694
Of course I did.

01:21:03.228 --> 01:21:05.362
I want her to be happy.

01:21:09.162 --> 01:21:12.493
Although there is one thing
I need to tell you.

01:21:12.495 --> 01:21:13.994
Okay.

01:21:15.095 --> 01:21:16.794
About Yvonne?

01:21:18.961 --> 01:21:20.360
No, about you.

01:21:24.828 --> 01:21:26.059
That your phone?

01:21:43.127 --> 01:21:45.759
- Hello?
- <i>Hi.</i>

01:21:45.761 --> 01:21:49.327
<i>Just ringing to tell you
that Chris died last night.</i>

01:21:52.828 --> 01:21:55.993
- <i>Are you there?</i>
- Yeah, yeah.

01:21:55.995 --> 01:21:57.893
<i>Don't know
when the funeral is yet,</i>

01:21:57.895 --> 01:22:00.326
<i>but I'll send you a text
when I do.</i>

01:22:00.328 --> 01:22:01.760
Okay.

01:22:03.195 --> 01:22:05.859
Are you all right?

01:22:10.194 --> 01:22:12.059
What is it?

01:22:14.394 --> 01:22:16.728
A guy I know died.

01:22:19.195 --> 01:22:21.128
Was he a friend of yours?

01:22:25.927 --> 01:22:28.162
- I have to go.
- Okay.

01:22:42.395 --> 01:22:44.393
We had a good time,
didn't we?

01:22:44.395 --> 01:22:46.160
Yeah.

01:22:46.162 --> 01:22:48.160
Well, I did.

01:22:48.162 --> 01:22:49.760
Yeah, no, so did I.

01:22:52.195 --> 01:22:56.726
So do you wanna
get together again maybe?

01:22:56.728 --> 01:22:59.926
Yeah, I don't know.

01:22:59.928 --> 01:23:01.225
You don't know?

01:23:01.227 --> 01:23:03.160
I, um...

01:23:03.162 --> 01:23:06.726
Was what we did not just like
a one-night thing?

01:23:06.728 --> 01:23:09.126
Oh, is that what it was?

01:23:09.128 --> 01:23:12.293
- Well, it...
- No, that's fine.

01:23:12.295 --> 01:23:13.758
That's fine.
I'll see you around.

01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:15.126
Don't be like that.
Listen...

01:23:15.128 --> 01:23:17.092
Fuck off, will you?

01:23:17.094 --> 01:23:18.894
Go on.

01:23:20.328 --> 01:23:22.759
- Fair enough.
- Fucking asshole.

01:23:22.761 --> 01:23:25.159
It was nice having
your miserable,

01:23:25.161 --> 01:23:26.759
pathetic fucking excuse

01:23:26.761 --> 01:23:29.759
for a miserable fucking cock
inside me!

01:23:41.827 --> 01:23:44.326
And he always cared
how other people were.

01:23:44.328 --> 01:23:46.426
I mean, you know that.

01:23:46.428 --> 01:23:48.792
I mean, even as kids,
I remember

01:23:48.794 --> 01:23:52.292
because you'd expect the case
to be the reverse,

01:23:52.294 --> 01:23:56.326
particularly with kids,
but no.

01:23:56.328 --> 01:23:59.093
I remember one time
our cousins came over,

01:23:59.095 --> 01:24:01.360
- Patsy and Pudge.
- Okay.

01:24:01.362 --> 01:24:04.160
And Patsy was really upset...

01:24:04.162 --> 01:24:05.992
How are you? My God.

01:24:05.994 --> 01:24:08.759
Good. It's so nice
to see you.

01:24:08.761 --> 01:24:10.125
This is Robert.

01:24:10.127 --> 01:24:12.192
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

01:24:12.194 --> 01:24:14.192
- So, you and Jim...
- That's right.

01:24:14.194 --> 01:24:15.859
- I see.
- That's okay.

01:24:15.861 --> 01:24:18.026
Just one of those things
we have to explain to people

01:24:18.028 --> 01:24:19.427
every once in a while.

01:24:22.228 --> 01:24:24.393
You know me and Lisa broke up.

01:24:24.395 --> 01:24:27.059
Oh, that's right.

01:24:27.061 --> 01:24:29.362
That was a while ago now
though, wasn't it?

01:24:32.094 --> 01:24:33.761
Still, though...

01:24:37.495 --> 01:24:39.159
- Isabelle.
- Yeah?

01:24:39.161 --> 01:24:40.759
- Be careful.
- Okay.

01:24:40.761 --> 01:24:42.859
And watch your sister.
Where is she?

01:24:42.861 --> 01:24:45.059
Sophie...

01:24:45.061 --> 01:24:46.426
Be careful.

01:24:46.428 --> 01:24:48.859
Okay!

01:24:48.861 --> 01:24:50.858
Sorry, Joan.

01:24:50.860 --> 01:24:53.460
We just kind of knew each other
just from around the building.

01:24:53.462 --> 01:24:55.126
We'd not talked, really, but...

01:24:55.128 --> 01:24:57.759
So it was more a mutual
admiration type of thing.

01:24:57.761 --> 01:25:01.393
Not exactly, but I can't deny
I found him handsome.

01:25:01.395 --> 01:25:03.893
- And what about you, Robert?
- What?

01:25:03.895 --> 01:25:05.726
- You think she was gorgeous?
- Martina.

01:25:05.728 --> 01:25:08.226
Well, you are bloody gorgeous,
Danielle.

01:25:08.228 --> 01:25:09.759
Did you?

01:25:09.761 --> 01:25:12.393
You don't want to move on,
of course,

01:25:12.395 --> 01:25:15.193
but what the hell choice
do you have, you know?

01:25:15.195 --> 01:25:16.892
And then one day, you're like,

01:25:16.894 --> 01:25:19.426
"What the fuck
was all the anger about?"

01:25:19.428 --> 01:25:22.460
You know, the fucking rage
or whatever.

01:25:22.462 --> 01:25:24.826
Dad, can we talk to you
for a minute?

01:25:24.828 --> 01:25:26.895
- Yeah.
- Outside?

01:25:36.262 --> 01:25:37.393
Sit here.

01:25:37.395 --> 01:25:38.827
Okay.

01:25:42.061 --> 01:25:45.460
Okay. We have a problem.

01:25:45.462 --> 01:25:46.792
Uh-huh.

01:25:46.794 --> 01:25:48.292
Mam has a boyfriend.

01:25:48.294 --> 01:25:51.028
- Right. Robert.
- Right.

01:25:53.128 --> 01:25:54.826
Is he nice?

01:25:54.828 --> 01:25:57.926
Well, that's the problem,
you see.

01:25:57.928 --> 01:26:00.260
- He isn't?
- He is.

01:26:00.262 --> 01:26:03.326
He is, and we like him
an awful lot,

01:26:03.328 --> 01:26:07.892
but that kind of makes us sad.

01:26:07.894 --> 01:26:09.992
Doesn't it?

01:26:09.994 --> 01:26:13.058
Because you're our dad,
you see,

01:26:13.060 --> 01:26:17.026
and it feels like,
if he's your enemy,

01:26:17.028 --> 01:26:20.162
then it's like
we're betraying you.

01:26:21.895 --> 01:26:24.059
But he's not my enemy.

01:26:24.061 --> 01:26:25.295
No?

01:26:29.095 --> 01:26:31.825
Does he make your mam happy?

01:26:31.827 --> 01:26:33.726
Yes.

01:26:33.728 --> 01:26:35.426
And you like him.

01:26:35.428 --> 01:26:37.460
- He's so kind.
- And funny.

01:26:37.462 --> 01:26:38.661
And funny.

01:26:40.294 --> 01:26:43.227
Well, then that makes me happy.

01:26:44.361 --> 01:26:46.093
Are you sure?

01:26:46.095 --> 01:26:48.262
Because you kind of look like
you're gonna cry.

01:26:51.162 --> 01:26:54.293
I thought of poor Chris,
suddenly.

01:26:54.295 --> 01:26:55.694
That's all.

01:27:04.161 --> 01:27:05.861
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, son.

01:27:08.327 --> 01:27:10.028
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, love.

01:27:19.295 --> 01:27:22.025
- I remember when Mam was dying.
- Right.

01:27:22.027 --> 01:27:23.992
She was talking about
the things we did as kids

01:27:23.994 --> 01:27:25.726
that meant the most to her,

01:27:25.728 --> 01:27:29.259
and she said
the mornings he'd wake her

01:27:29.261 --> 01:27:32.792
by blowing softly
on her eyelids.

01:27:32.794 --> 01:27:36.425
I mean, he was only two
or three at the time,

01:27:36.427 --> 01:27:41.858
but she said to be woken
in such a lovely, gentle way...

01:27:41.860 --> 01:27:43.791
That's okay.

01:27:43.793 --> 01:27:48.226
And to see his little face
smiling down at her, she just...

01:27:48.228 --> 01:27:51.292
- That's okay.
- She...

01:27:51.294 --> 01:27:52.794
Fucking prick!

01:27:54.794 --> 01:27:56.828
Jim! Jim!

01:28:09.060 --> 01:28:12.925
I love you
more than anything.

01:28:12.927 --> 01:28:14.161
Telly!

01:28:15.928 --> 01:28:18.059
All I want is for you
to be happy, love.

01:28:18.061 --> 01:28:20.392
- Shurrup, telly.
- No, you don't.

01:28:20.394 --> 01:28:22.792
- Why don't I?
- 'Cause you're a wanker.

01:28:22.794 --> 01:28:24.893
- I know I am.
- Telly!

01:28:24.895 --> 01:28:26.725
I know,
but I won't be again.

01:28:26.727 --> 01:28:29.426
I promise you here and now.
Do you hear me?

01:28:29.428 --> 01:28:31.093
Telly, will you shurrup?

01:28:31.095 --> 01:28:34.825
You shut the fuck up,
stupid fucking bitch!

01:28:34.827 --> 01:28:36.058
It can't hear you!

01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:38.362
The telly
can't fucking hear you!

01:28:41.462 --> 01:28:44.325
My fucking rib is broken,
I know it.

01:28:44.327 --> 01:28:46.325
Look at my face,
for fuck's sake.

01:28:46.327 --> 01:28:48.492
- Well, you deserve it.
- I know I do.

01:28:48.494 --> 01:28:50.993
That's what I'm saying.
When we get ourselves fixed up,

01:28:50.995 --> 01:28:53.126
we'll go home and we'll just be
good to each other, yeah?

01:28:53.128 --> 01:28:54.360
- 'Cause I love you.
- Ah, telly.

01:28:54.362 --> 01:28:57.858
Shut the fuck up,
I told you!

01:28:57.860 --> 01:28:59.362
Jesus Christ!

01:29:03.895 --> 01:29:06.092
Girls, come on,
it's time to get moving now.

01:29:06.094 --> 01:29:07.993
And she says that blond hair's
better than black

01:29:07.995 --> 01:29:09.292
and that red hair
is the worst.

01:29:09.294 --> 01:29:10.926
- But Stephanie said...
- It is the worst.

01:29:10.928 --> 01:29:12.893
- No, it's not.
- No, it's not

01:29:12.895 --> 01:29:14.993
because Stephanie said that
because it's the rarest...

01:29:14.995 --> 01:29:17.093
- Love you, Mam.
- Love you, Mam.

01:29:17.095 --> 01:29:18.791
Love you, girls!

01:29:18.793 --> 01:29:19.993
Thanks!

01:29:29.794 --> 01:29:31.959
Thanks, Patricia!

01:29:31.961 --> 01:29:36.492
My God, that's some weather.
You okay?

01:29:36.494 --> 01:29:39.293
Do I hear a click?

01:29:39.295 --> 01:29:41.059
Do I hear a second click?

01:29:41.061 --> 01:29:42.326
Can we see <i>Jaws?</i>

01:29:42.328 --> 01:29:44.028
Do I hear a second click?

01:29:49.362 --> 01:29:52.493
- So is it a date?
- Hmm?

01:29:52.495 --> 01:29:54.292
That you're going on.

01:29:54.294 --> 01:29:56.227
None of your business.

01:29:58.861 --> 01:30:03.760
No. It's just an old friend
I'm having a bite to eat with.

01:30:06.095 --> 01:30:07.460
Do you like him?

01:30:07.462 --> 01:30:09.958
Do I like him?

01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:11.395
- Yeah.
- Why do you ask?

01:30:13.262 --> 01:30:14.892
'Cause you're blushing.

01:30:14.894 --> 01:30:16.493
Am I blushing?

01:30:16.495 --> 01:30:18.792
Sarah, you have way more
interest in my social life

01:30:18.794 --> 01:30:20.928
than I think is appropriate.

01:30:34.328 --> 01:30:36.326
Can I get you
some water to start?

01:30:36.328 --> 01:30:40.728
Yeah, and a glass of whatever
the house red is would be great.

01:31:16.228 --> 01:31:17.961
Hi.

01:31:19.362 --> 01:31:21.026
Hi.

01:31:21.028 --> 01:31:23.791
- And where do you live now?
- Rathmines.

01:31:23.793 --> 01:31:25.226
Right.

01:31:25.228 --> 01:31:26.925
- You?
- Killester.

01:31:26.927 --> 01:31:28.393
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

01:31:28.395 --> 01:31:30.393
We've only there a few weeks,
so, you know,

01:31:30.395 --> 01:31:32.926
there's still a lot of
unpacking, etcetera.

01:31:32.928 --> 01:31:36.359
- Right.
- There's settling in to be done.

01:31:36.361 --> 01:31:39.093
And are you still in...
What is it?

01:31:39.095 --> 01:31:40.759
Brophy's. I am.

01:31:40.761 --> 01:31:42.459
Though I'm back
to full-time now.

01:31:42.461 --> 01:31:45.126
The necessity of being
a single parent.

01:31:45.128 --> 01:31:47.925
At least you don't have as far
to commute anymore.

01:31:47.927 --> 01:31:52.326
That's true. Well, that's mainly
the reason we moved out there.

01:31:52.328 --> 01:31:55.025
- How are the girls?
- They're well.

01:31:55.027 --> 01:31:58.225
They're well.
They miss their dad.

01:31:58.227 --> 01:31:59.826
Right.

01:31:59.828 --> 01:32:02.826
How about your guys?
Or shouldn't I ask?

01:32:02.828 --> 01:32:06.226
It's fine. They're fine.

01:32:06.228 --> 01:32:09.791
I get to see them every
second weekend, which is...

01:32:09.793 --> 01:32:12.293
better than not at all,
I suppose.

01:32:12.295 --> 01:32:17.058
Danielle and I
remain polite to each other,

01:32:17.060 --> 01:32:18.726
for their sake.

01:32:18.728 --> 01:32:21.493
And is she still with that guy?

01:32:21.495 --> 01:32:23.959
- You don't ever see her?
- Not really, no.

01:32:23.961 --> 01:32:25.425
Robert.

01:32:25.427 --> 01:32:29.026
She is. He's okay.

01:32:29.028 --> 01:32:30.959
They're in Blackrock.
Really big house out there,

01:32:30.961 --> 01:32:33.160
so she didn't do too badly
for herself.

01:32:33.162 --> 01:32:36.725
Not that that kind of stuff
was ever important to her

01:32:36.727 --> 01:32:40.260
in any case, but still...

01:32:40.262 --> 01:32:42.892
Go there to pick up the kids.
I feel like a tramp.

01:32:42.894 --> 01:32:47.092
- Do you?
- Sometimes, yeah, a little bit.

01:32:47.094 --> 01:32:50.761
But I can't say he isn't...
he isn't crazy about them.

01:32:54.828 --> 01:32:57.825
I sometimes kind of think
she knows it was me.

01:32:57.827 --> 01:33:00.126
- Danielle?
- Mm-hmm.

01:33:00.128 --> 01:33:02.825
- Really?
- Or suspects.

01:33:02.827 --> 01:33:04.925
I don't know.

01:33:04.927 --> 01:33:06.958
She just...

01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:09.893
I felt she really withdrew
from me after the funeral.

01:33:09.895 --> 01:33:13.726
- Right.
- Like consciously, you know?

01:33:13.728 --> 01:33:16.459
She never said anything
to you, did she?

01:33:16.461 --> 01:33:18.758
No, well,
that particular subject

01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:21.262
wouldn't come up
in any case, you know?

01:33:32.395 --> 01:33:34.392
Are you seeing anyone
these days?

01:33:34.394 --> 01:33:36.125
No.

01:33:36.127 --> 01:33:39.492
Well, actually, I went out
with a guy quite recently.

01:33:39.494 --> 01:33:40.859
Right.

01:33:40.861 --> 01:33:43.093
Though when I say
"went out with,"

01:33:43.095 --> 01:33:45.959
I mean like two or three dates.

01:33:45.961 --> 01:33:48.026
Why? What happened?

01:33:48.028 --> 01:33:49.660
Was he an asshole?

01:33:54.228 --> 01:33:57.826
You understand why I had to do
what I had to do, Jim.

01:33:57.828 --> 01:33:59.292
What do you mean?

01:33:59.294 --> 01:34:01.159
Regarding Chris.

01:34:01.161 --> 01:34:03.192
Oh, of course.

01:34:03.194 --> 01:34:08.260
Oh, Yvonne,
don't ever think that I...

01:34:08.262 --> 01:34:11.993
Yes, I mean,
what else could you do?

01:34:11.995 --> 01:34:17.260
I know at the time,
I was... what was I...

01:34:17.262 --> 01:34:19.326
- childish about it.
- You weren't childish.

01:34:19.328 --> 01:34:22.325
Or selfish about it.
I was, Yvonne.

01:34:22.327 --> 01:34:25.726
But no. No, you did
the right thing.

01:34:25.728 --> 01:34:29.292
Please don't ever think
that I don't think that.

01:34:29.294 --> 01:34:31.492
Okay.

01:34:31.494 --> 01:34:33.126
- Oh.
- The risotto.

01:34:33.128 --> 01:34:35.260
That's me. Thank you.

01:34:35.262 --> 01:34:37.160
- And the monkfish.
- Thank you.

01:34:37.162 --> 01:34:38.760
Enjoy.

01:34:42.362 --> 01:34:47.493
Because, see, what happened
with this guy was...

01:34:47.495 --> 01:34:49.092
- the one I was seeing.
- Right.

01:34:49.094 --> 01:34:51.427
Was... It's stupid, but...

01:34:54.794 --> 01:34:58.226
I couldn't get it out of my head
that if I slept with him,

01:34:58.228 --> 01:35:00.162
I'd be cheating on you.

01:35:03.727 --> 01:35:04.825
I see.

01:35:04.827 --> 01:35:06.393
Is that crazy?

01:35:06.395 --> 01:35:08.125
I don't know.

01:35:08.127 --> 01:35:11.359
To feel I'd be doing that?

01:35:11.361 --> 01:35:13.225
It probably is.

01:35:13.227 --> 01:35:15.993
I bet it is, but...

01:35:15.995 --> 01:35:17.928
I just couldn't do it.

01:35:19.861 --> 01:35:24.827
Because my feelings for you
I realized hadn't lessened.

01:35:26.195 --> 01:35:27.892
- You know what I mean?
- Yvonne...

01:35:27.894 --> 01:35:29.693
No, hang on a minute.

01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:33.493
At all.

01:35:33.495 --> 01:35:35.958
They'd just been sort of,
I don't know,

01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:38.027
put aside, I suppose.

01:35:41.261 --> 01:35:45.359
But if you wanted...

01:35:45.361 --> 01:35:50.226
If you wanted,
we could start again,

01:35:50.228 --> 01:35:51.925
and it could be something
we wouldn't have to feel

01:35:51.927 --> 01:35:56.125
compromised by or guilty about
anymore or mistrust

01:35:56.127 --> 01:36:00.092
because it isn't built on
something real or, you know,

01:36:00.094 --> 01:36:02.392
or honest.

01:36:02.394 --> 01:36:03.759
Right.

01:36:03.761 --> 01:36:05.427
Or fair.

01:36:07.461 --> 01:36:10.459
'Cause it'd be only us.

01:36:10.461 --> 01:36:14.262
'Cause there'd be no Danielle
or Chris 'cause... Right?

01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:17.860
'Cause it'd be only us.

01:36:19.793 --> 01:36:21.927
And it could be right now.

01:36:25.227 --> 01:36:26.861
Jim...

01:36:28.928 --> 01:36:30.726
Yeah.

01:36:30.728 --> 01:36:33.195
It could be right now.

01:37:06.228 --> 01:37:08.193
Go away.

01:37:08.195 --> 01:37:09.293
I...

01:37:09.295 --> 01:37:11.694
Go away, go away.

01:37:34.127 --> 01:37:35.393
Did you fuck her?

01:37:35.395 --> 01:37:37.759
- What?
- Did you fuck her?

01:37:37.761 --> 01:37:39.359
- No, I didn't fuck her. Jesus!
- Are you going to?

01:37:39.361 --> 01:37:40.759
- No.
- Yeah, right.

01:37:40.761 --> 01:37:42.425
- Orla...
- Yeah, right

01:37:42.427 --> 01:37:44.292
First fucking chance you get,
you'll be in her knickers.

01:37:44.294 --> 01:37:46.392
- No, I won't. Listen...
- Yes, you will.

01:37:46.394 --> 01:37:49.260
Get the fuck away from me,
you scumbag!

01:37:49.262 --> 01:37:52.660
You knacker!
I fucking hate you!

01:38:23.894 --> 01:38:26.025
And what was it like?

01:38:26.027 --> 01:38:28.161
- The place itself?
- Mm.

01:38:29.394 --> 01:38:31.661
I don't know. It was nice.

01:38:32.961 --> 01:38:35.225
Was it posh?

01:38:35.227 --> 01:38:37.725
It was fine.

01:38:37.727 --> 01:38:40.925
Sure we'll go there ourselves
some night, if you want.

01:38:40.927 --> 01:38:42.994
Yeah, I'd love that, actually.

01:38:49.495 --> 01:38:52.094
And you didn't
feel anything for her?

01:38:53.728 --> 01:38:56.225
No.

01:38:56.227 --> 01:38:57.993
Are you sure?

01:38:57.995 --> 01:39:00.294
- Orla.
- Sorry.

01:39:01.793 --> 01:39:03.394
I am sure.

01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:07.693
So what did you feel?

01:39:10.060 --> 01:39:13.192
I just felt...

01:39:13.194 --> 01:39:17.359
that was then, you know?

01:39:17.361 --> 01:39:19.993
And this is now.

01:39:19.995 --> 01:39:21.028
Yeah.

01:39:23.794 --> 01:39:26.026
I'm sorry about
the way I acted.

01:39:26.028 --> 01:39:27.727
That's okay.

01:39:30.462 --> 01:39:32.992
- Get up and dance with me.
- What?

01:39:32.994 --> 01:39:34.293
Come on.

01:39:34.295 --> 01:39:36.293
Fuck that.
I hate this song.

01:39:36.295 --> 01:39:38.292
You hate it?

01:39:38.294 --> 01:39:41.759
I think it's a brilliant song.

01:39:41.761 --> 01:39:44.327
All right, we'll pick
another one. How about that?

01:39:53.362 --> 01:39:54.992
What about this one?

01:39:54.994 --> 01:39:57.725
- What.
- Do you like it?

01:39:57.727 --> 01:40:00.362
- It's all right.
- Well, come on, then.

01:40:26.295 --> 01:40:28.094
Tell me something nice.

01:40:29.894 --> 01:40:31.959
Like what?

01:40:31.961 --> 01:40:33.227
I don't know.

01:40:35.461 --> 01:40:37.394
Tell me you love me.

01:40:44.727 --> 01:40:45.994
I love you.

01:40:47.727 --> 01:40:49.060
I love you.
