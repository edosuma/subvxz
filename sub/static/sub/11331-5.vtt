00:00.150 --> 00:02.811
Previously on The Secret Life
Of The American Teenager...

00:02.953 --> 00:04.119
No!

00:04.258 --> 00:06.499
Our Ashley is gone.

00:08.150 --> 00:08.982
What?

00:09.099 --> 00:10.473
I'd like to have a wedding
reception for you

00:10.584 --> 00:11.731
and I don't want you to say no.

00:11.835 --> 00:12.937
So stalking to coach Walkins.

00:13.054 --> 00:13.798
What?

00:13.959 --> 00:16.140
And he doesn't have any
objections to you being a little more

00:16.328 --> 00:18.206
public about being a Christian?

00:18.325 --> 00:20.312
Omar is not a pervert!
That's ridiculous!

00:20.396 --> 00:22.641
And I don't believe anyone on the
schoolboard is going to believe that.

00:22.756 --> 00:24.669
I know, but that's the
power of suggestion.

00:25.104 --> 00:26.605
I did not burn the school down.

00:26.639 --> 00:28.206
Who lit the Bunsen burner?

00:28.241 --> 00:29.274
The Bunsen burner?

00:29.308 --> 00:30.308
You lit it?

00:31.511 --> 00:32.610
Who lit the Bunsen burner?

00:32.645 --> 00:34.579
Don't answer that.
I don't remember.

00:34.614 --> 00:36.414
Amy said I don't
want a wedding?

00:36.449 --> 00:38.283
She said she wants
a wedding, but I don't?

00:38.317 --> 00:39.518
That's what she said
this morning.

00:39.552 --> 00:41.586
Well, I came down here
to try to save Omar

00:41.621 --> 00:44.222
but you need divine intervention
just as much as he does.

00:44.257 --> 00:46.224
How would you feel
about going to church?

00:46.259 --> 00:48.426
You got a package from Mimsy.
It came overnight.

00:48.461 --> 00:52.264
Just toss it, it's probably just another bag of socks.
She keeps sending me socks.

00:52.298 --> 00:55.600
Why is there a Detective Shanahan
in the living room with my parents?

00:55.635 --> 00:57.669
Don't panic.
It's all going to be fine.

00:57.703 --> 01:00.438
No, it's not.

01:00.473 --> 01:02.507
I'm telling you,
I do not want a wedding.

01:02.542 --> 01:04.242
Don't tell me,
tell your mother.

01:04.277 --> 01:06.211
Oh, no.
You tell my mother.

01:06.245 --> 01:08.313
You're the one who told her we'd
go along with her big plans.

01:08.347 --> 01:10.549
Okay, I'll tell her as
long as you tell her why.

01:10.583 --> 01:12.484
What do you mean?

01:12.518 --> 01:14.386
I mean you have to work out
whatever your issues are

01:14.420 --> 01:15.520
around not being comfortable
with gay people.

01:17.256 --> 01:19.357
I'm comfortable with
people who are gay!

01:19.392 --> 01:21.560
I totally am.

01:21.594 --> 01:24.362
I just wouldn't be comfortable with
her and a date, gay or straight.

01:24.397 --> 01:26.264
The date is not
going to be straight.

01:26.299 --> 01:28.366
Not if the wedding
is any time soon no.

01:28.401 --> 01:30.669
So that's why, I don't want
her to plan our wedding

01:30.703 --> 01:33.338
and then show up with a date whose
going to be in all the photos,

01:33.372 --> 01:35.440
and then have her change her
mind about who she is again,

01:35.474 --> 01:38.343
and then go back
with my dad again,

01:38.377 --> 01:40.312
which would be
the perfect photo,

01:40.346 --> 01:41.746
just me and my mom and my dad.

01:41.781 --> 01:44.583
What about Ashley?
Ashley's in Italy. Perfect.

01:44.617 --> 01:47.319
Look, your mother is not
going back with your father,

01:47.353 --> 01:49.754
she's gay, all right?
And she feels very vulnerable right now,

01:49.789 --> 01:52.490
and she feels left out more
than she ever felt left out, so

01:52.525 --> 01:54.559
we're just going to go along with
the wedding and get it over with.

01:54.594 --> 01:57.562
I don't want a wedding to be
something we just get over with.

01:57.597 --> 02:01.366
Our wedding was really fun, even
though we didn't get married.

02:01.400 --> 02:04.436
I have to go. I have to stop by the cash
machine, I don't have any money on me.

02:07.306 --> 02:09.507
Aw. Thanks John.

02:10.675 --> 02:12.611
Wait a minute.
Where'd you get this?

02:12.645 --> 02:14.579
It's not real.
Is it?

02:14.614 --> 02:16.414
It looks real to me.

02:23.723 --> 02:25.724
Holy Toledo,

02:25.758 --> 02:28.627
it's not socks,
Mimsy sent cash!

02:31.330 --> 02:32.430
Cash! Yes!

02:32.465 --> 02:33.598
No! We can't keep that.

02:33.633 --> 02:36.368
Oh! Here's the withdrawal.

02:36.402 --> 02:38.670
A thousand dollars?
She sent Ashley ten thousand dollars!

02:38.704 --> 02:40.605
And we got zero.
We are not keeping that.

02:40.640 --> 02:42.674
I am. It's not your grandmother,
you don't get to decide.

02:42.708 --> 02:44.442
Your grandmother
has Alzheimer's,

02:44.477 --> 02:46.244
she might need that
money, we can't take

02:46.278 --> 02:47.579
money from her,
even if Ashley did.

02:47.613 --> 02:48.647
It's only a thousand dollars.

02:48.681 --> 02:50.382
Only? Only a
thousand dollars?

02:50.416 --> 02:53.218
You have any idea how difficult
it is to earn a thousand dollars,

02:53.252 --> 02:54.452
let alone save
a thousand dollars?

02:54.487 --> 02:56.221
Um, Yes.

02:56.255 --> 02:57.255
No you don't.

02:57.289 --> 02:58.556
I'll just put it
in my bank account

02:58.591 --> 03:00.492
and then we can decide
what to do with it.

03:00.526 --> 03:03.361
I don't think so, just hand the cash over
to your mother, just like we got it.

03:03.396 --> 03:04.562
We didn't get it, I got it.

03:04.597 --> 03:06.498
And I am not going
to give it to my mother.

03:06.532 --> 03:08.299
She'd probably squander it on our
stupid wedding or something.

03:08.334 --> 03:09.367
Give it to your mother.

03:09.402 --> 03:11.336
It's my money.
It's not your money.

03:11.370 --> 03:13.605
My money.

03:13.639 --> 03:17.308
Look, I'll just hold on to it.
We can talk about it later when we get home.

03:17.343 --> 03:19.210
You're going to walk around
with a thousand dollars on you?

03:19.245 --> 03:20.612
I might. What'd you do with
the money Leo gave you?

03:20.646 --> 03:21.646
I put it in the bank.

03:21.681 --> 03:23.515
In your account?
Yes. In my account.

03:23.549 --> 03:25.316
We don't have a joint account,

03:25.351 --> 03:27.285
and I don't want a joint
account with you, honey.

03:27.319 --> 03:28.420
Oh, really?
Why is that?

03:28.454 --> 03:30.288
Because you don't
balance your account.

03:30.322 --> 03:32.223
I balance my account.
And I pay all the bills here.

03:32.258 --> 03:34.225
Okay, well then, I'll
put this in my account,

03:34.260 --> 03:35.260
and I'll pay some
of the bills with it.

03:35.294 --> 03:37.262
I think the system
we have is working.

03:37.296 --> 03:40.365
Just give that money back to your mom to
give back to Mimsy and let's go to school.

03:40.399 --> 03:41.733
I have to get to school.

03:41.767 --> 03:44.469
Oh, right, I forgot.
It's your first day of college. Good luck!

03:46.605 --> 03:47.706
Come on, John.

03:49.442 --> 03:50.642
Amy.

03:50.676 --> 03:52.544
Ricky. We can't keep that money.

03:52.578 --> 03:53.578
Bye.

Hi there.

04:33.385 --> 04:37.288
Oh. I, uh, guess
for your boyfriend.

04:37.556 --> 04:39.224
Ugh.

04:39.258 --> 04:41.359
I say that because
if you might be...

04:41.393 --> 04:42.594
Might be what?

04:42.628 --> 04:44.596
Might be looking for someone.

04:44.630 --> 04:45.630
Are you looking for someone?

04:45.664 --> 04:47.465
Are you looking for someone?

04:47.500 --> 04:51.236
I, you know, good from behind.

04:51.270 --> 04:52.570
What does that mean?
From the front?

04:52.605 --> 04:53.671
You have a really cute face.

04:53.706 --> 04:55.340
Just not as cute as my butt?

04:55.374 --> 04:57.408
Both things are nice.
I got to go now.

05:03.315 --> 05:05.150
Hi!

05:05.184 --> 05:06.384
You must be new here.

05:06.418 --> 05:09.187
Okay, it's way too early
to be that perky.

05:09.221 --> 05:10.555
And I can't stand perky.

05:10.589 --> 05:12.357
And I don't need any help.

05:12.391 --> 05:14.259
Okay, well, I just
wanted to say hello.

05:15.361 --> 05:17.095
And, um...

05:17.129 --> 05:19.097
You know, the same thing
good friend of mine.

05:19.131 --> 05:20.398
You're kidding?

05:20.432 --> 05:24.135
So, I'm not the
something stupid?

05:24.170 --> 05:26.237
Or was your friend's
teenage pregnancy?

05:27.540 --> 05:29.541
I love funny people!
Loves funny people?

05:29.575 --> 05:31.309
It's Jesus.

05:31.343 --> 05:33.244
Oh no. I hope you're talking
about Jesus Martinez.

05:33.279 --> 05:34.546
Who's that?
A good friend of mine.

05:34.580 --> 05:36.214
I'd love to meet him.

05:36.248 --> 05:37.415
Why don't you bring him
to church on Sunday?

05:37.449 --> 05:38.483
Why don't you go to hell?

05:39.585 --> 05:42.487
Hey, how have you been?

05:42.521 --> 05:44.422
Hey, Grant!
Where have you been?

05:44.456 --> 05:46.191
I had to miss the first week.

05:46.225 --> 05:48.126
I've been traveling.
A couple of colleges

05:48.160 --> 05:49.360
with some other students.

05:49.395 --> 05:51.529
If you had gone to med cp
you could have gone with us.

05:51.564 --> 05:55.200
You toured colleges?
Yeah.

05:55.234 --> 05:57.569
That sounds interesting.

05:57.603 --> 06:01.139
I also had a really
good summer.

06:01.173 --> 06:04.442
Yeah, I heard you went on
vacation in Lesbian Land.

06:04.476 --> 06:07.512
What I meant was,
a Christian again.

06:07.546 --> 06:09.447
I figured. I heard that girl
tell you to go to hell.

06:09.481 --> 06:11.316
Yeah, that wasn't very nice.

06:11.350 --> 06:13.117
It just looked like
she could use a friend.

06:13.152 --> 06:16.087
It looks like she's had
a very close friend.

06:16.121 --> 06:18.256
I think what she needs
now is a gynecologist.

06:18.290 --> 06:21.092
Speaking of which, all of
us fourth term campers

06:21.126 --> 06:22.460
got into three schools
on scholarships,

06:22.494 --> 06:24.229
we just have to pick one,

06:24.263 --> 06:26.397
and we have the option of
graduating high school in January

06:26.432 --> 06:27.465
and starting college earlier.

06:27.499 --> 06:29.467
Really?
Really.

06:29.501 --> 06:32.437
And you know who told us?

06:32.471 --> 06:34.539
Dr. Regina Benjamin
the Surgeon General.

06:34.573 --> 06:36.140
Yeah, I know who she is.

06:36.175 --> 06:40.345
She's incredible.
Really inspiring.

06:42.114 --> 06:46.184
Not like your Lord of
course, but still.

06:47.353 --> 06:49.287
I'll see you later, Grace.

06:52.157 --> 06:55.460
If I just hadn't,
gone on vacation.

06:56.262 --> 06:57.528
Ugh!

07:01.500 --> 07:03.067
What's your problem?

07:03.102 --> 07:05.103
What's my problem?
I could be going to jail.

07:05.137 --> 07:06.471
Are you new here?

07:06.505 --> 07:08.139
Have you seen me before?

07:08.173 --> 07:09.274
Actually, I kind of have.

07:11.143 --> 07:12.310
Deja vu.
Weirdo.

07:14.113 --> 07:15.313
Hello, Ben.

07:15.347 --> 07:17.181
I don't like the
What do you know?

07:17.216 --> 07:19.250
Plenty. Henry and I
stayed up all night talking.

07:19.285 --> 07:20.385
Did you have sex with him?

07:20.419 --> 07:22.086
Did I say we had sex?
We didn't have sex.

07:22.121 --> 07:24.088
We had a conversation.

07:24.123 --> 07:25.223
Well, I hate to tell you
that leads to sex,

07:25.257 --> 07:27.058
you didn't tell him we
had sex, did you?

07:27.092 --> 07:28.259
No. But he told me

07:28.294 --> 07:29.494
that you told him
that you are still

07:29.528 --> 07:33.031
uncomfortable around him
because he slept with Adrian.

07:33.065 --> 07:34.365
Yeah?
Yeah?

07:34.400 --> 07:36.067
That was a lie!

07:36.101 --> 07:37.468
And he feels terrible that
you haven't let go of that.

07:37.503 --> 07:40.505
He feels as if he has to earn his
way back into your good graces.

07:40.539 --> 07:42.507
I had to tell him that.
He saw that we were talking,

07:42.541 --> 07:44.342
he saw the conversation
was intense

07:44.376 --> 07:46.110
and he wanted to know
what we were talking about.

07:46.145 --> 07:48.446
I couldn't tell him we were
talking about that stupid fire.

07:49.515 --> 07:51.449
We will continue this
conversation later,

07:51.483 --> 07:53.151
Ben Boykewich.

07:55.187 --> 07:57.288
I've been trying to call you.
I don't have a phone.

07:57.323 --> 07:59.324
It was taken away,
so I couldn't call you.

07:59.358 --> 08:02.093
Well, what did you
tell the detective?

08:02.127 --> 08:04.195
I told him that nothing we did

08:04.229 --> 08:07.365
that night in the science lab could
have possibly caused an explosion.

08:07.399 --> 08:11.035
Unless there was something
faulty in the gas line,

08:11.070 --> 08:15.139
in which case, we're all lucky it didn't
explode when school was in session.

08:15.174 --> 08:18.142
I told him that I was
really sorry we lied

08:18.177 --> 08:20.111
and went into the school
when we shouldn't have,

08:20.145 --> 08:22.280
but I just wanted
to get you to go

08:22.314 --> 08:24.282
to my school because
you're my boyfriend.

08:25.050 --> 08:27.318
Or you were.

08:27.353 --> 08:31.122
And I told him that although
you lit the Bunsen burner,

08:31.156 --> 08:33.024
and we roasted marshmallows,

08:33.058 --> 08:36.126
I clearly remember turning off the
Bunsen burner before we left.

08:37.096 --> 08:38.363
In other words,
I told the truth,

08:38.397 --> 08:40.198
the whole truth and
nothing but the truth.

08:40.232 --> 08:43.201
And you, you freaked
out and made everyone

08:43.235 --> 08:46.270
all crazy by suggesting things
that happened that didn't.

08:46.305 --> 08:49.207
And now my father is never
going to let me see you again.

08:49.241 --> 08:51.542
Which is probably best because
you're criminally neurotic!

08:53.479 --> 08:54.512
Goodbye.

08:56.148 --> 08:58.349
Ah, hello, loser.

08:58.384 --> 09:01.986
If you get her into anymore trouble, you're
going to have to answer to us, you know.

09:02.021 --> 09:05.056
And answering to us is
worse than going to jail.

09:05.090 --> 09:08.059
Be afraid.
Be very afraid.

09:08.093 --> 09:10.028
I was just trying to get
the truth out in the open.

09:10.062 --> 09:12.363
Sounds to me like you don't
know what the truth is.

09:12.398 --> 09:15.466
The truth is you're a loser.
So stay away from Dylan.

09:30.215 --> 09:32.283
Are you looking at my butt again?
No.

09:32.317 --> 09:34.218
I heard you told
Grace where to go.

09:34.253 --> 09:35.386
Awesome.
Leave me alone.

09:35.421 --> 09:37.422
Yeah, okay.

09:41.160 --> 09:42.226
Finally!

09:42.261 --> 09:44.162
I had to drop my son
off at the nursery,

09:44.196 --> 09:45.463
they were a little late
opening this morning.

09:45.497 --> 09:47.065
Were you waiting for me?

09:47.099 --> 09:48.499
Yes, I was waiting for you.

09:48.534 --> 09:50.468
What kind of mentor are you?

09:50.502 --> 09:54.105
I mean, you have one lousy conversation
with me and the you disappear.

09:54.139 --> 09:58.276
I'm sorry. What's wrong?
You sound really upset.

09:58.310 --> 10:02.180
I'm not upset, I just
don't have any friends.

10:02.214 --> 10:04.148
You're the only
person I know here.

10:04.183 --> 10:05.416
And I'm standing
here waiting for you

10:05.451 --> 10:08.486
looking like a total dork
with no one to talk to,

10:08.520 --> 10:10.521
and some guy
tries to hit on me.

10:10.556 --> 10:13.291
And then some Jesus freak tries
to get me to go to her church,

10:13.325 --> 10:15.359
Oh, that's just Grace.
She's harmless.

10:15.394 --> 10:18.229
Anyways, then this pinhead

10:18.263 --> 10:21.399
stops and stares and mutters
"deja vu" or something.

10:21.433 --> 10:23.501
Huh. Was he
a tall thin guy?

10:24.403 --> 10:26.370
'Bout like this?

10:26.405 --> 10:29.207
Nice looking, dark
hair, kind eyes.

10:29.241 --> 10:30.274
Yeah.
Yeah.

10:30.309 --> 10:31.442
That's probably Ben.

10:31.477 --> 10:34.112
He was my boyfriend
when I was pregnant.

10:34.146 --> 10:35.513
You had a boyfriend
when you were pregnant?

10:35.547 --> 10:38.282
Yeah. Ricky didn't exactly
come around a lot at first.

10:38.317 --> 10:40.151
And Ben kind
of fell in love with me

10:40.185 --> 10:43.521
and I fell in love with him and...
It was nice.

10:43.555 --> 10:45.123
He was nice.

10:45.157 --> 10:46.491
He treated me really well,

10:46.525 --> 10:49.260
but Ricky and I got
to know each other

10:49.294 --> 10:51.529
and we have John
and we fell in love

10:51.563 --> 10:53.498
and Ricky and I
are still in love

10:53.532 --> 10:55.399
and Ben has gone on
to other relationships.

10:55.434 --> 10:57.401
All right well thanks
for talking to me.

11:02.074 --> 11:03.374
Hi.
Back at ya.

11:03.408 --> 11:07.078
Oh, no! No, no, no, no.

11:16.722 --> 11:17.956
Can I heat that up for you?

11:19.858 --> 11:21.092
Ricky?
Uh, yeah?

11:21.126 --> 11:22.927
Don't you recognize me?

11:22.962 --> 11:24.062
I'm really sorry, no.

11:24.096 --> 11:26.731
Although I'm kind
of surprised I don't.

11:26.765 --> 11:28.032
If I should, I mean.

11:28.067 --> 11:30.068
And I'm not like that anymore.

11:30.102 --> 11:31.769
I'm in a relationship.

11:31.804 --> 11:34.072
A relationship, huh?
You're wearing a wedding band.

11:34.106 --> 11:36.975
Oh. Right. I'm married.

11:37.009 --> 11:39.944
Clementine? I lived at the
Ramsey's when you were there?

11:39.979 --> 11:41.079
You're that Clementine?

11:41.113 --> 11:42.847
I'm that Clementine.

11:44.083 --> 11:48.019
How are you? I'm good.
I'm a sophomore here.

11:48.053 --> 11:49.988
And I have a job now.

11:50.022 --> 11:51.889
And I have my own place so...

11:51.924 --> 11:54.158
Things are going much better
than I ever would have expected.

11:54.193 --> 11:56.160
And I have to say

11:56.195 --> 11:57.829
seems like things are going
better for you than I expected.

11:57.863 --> 11:58.963
Yeah, look at us.

11:58.998 --> 12:00.965
Who knew, huh?
Who knew.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.734
I thought you'd be in jail.

12:02.768 --> 12:05.103
You too. I mean, I thought
you'd be right there with me.

12:05.137 --> 12:06.804
I have to get back to work.

12:06.839 --> 12:08.706
But we have to catch up.

12:08.741 --> 12:09.974
I'm kind of in a relationship.

12:10.009 --> 12:12.844
Kind of?
Isn't that a wedding band?

12:12.878 --> 12:14.946
Oh. Yeah.
I'm married.

12:14.980 --> 12:16.748
Married? And you're
a freshman?

12:16.782 --> 12:17.849
Yeah.

12:17.883 --> 12:20.718
All right. She must be
a really special girl.

12:20.753 --> 12:24.922
Or, oh geez, you didn't have
to get married, did you?

12:24.957 --> 12:27.825
Have to? No. No one
has to get married.

12:27.860 --> 12:29.694
Look, it was great seeing you.

12:29.728 --> 12:33.131
If I don't see you again, it's just because...
I'm busy and everything.

12:33.165 --> 12:34.165
And married.

12:34.199 --> 12:35.867
Yeah, and that.

12:35.901 --> 12:37.735
Bye. Good to see you.

12:37.770 --> 12:38.836
Did I say that already?

12:38.871 --> 12:40.071
Um...

12:40.105 --> 12:42.106
Oh, yeah.

12:42.141 --> 12:44.842
You actually
tipped at the counter.

12:44.877 --> 12:45.943
I'm big on tipping.

12:47.146 --> 12:49.113
I don't know why
I said that. Bye.

12:56.989 --> 12:59.190
Buddy!
Oh God.

12:59.224 --> 13:01.092
Have you been to class yet?

13:01.126 --> 13:02.994
Yeah. I'm just waiting for the next one.
English lit.

13:03.028 --> 13:05.797
Oh. well, we've all got the same
class, we can walk over together.

13:05.831 --> 13:07.765
We've got a half hour,
let's grab some coffee.

13:07.800 --> 13:09.867
I did that, I had some coffee,
I'm just going to walk around.

13:09.902 --> 13:11.969
Have some more coffee, come on.
This is great, isn't it?

13:12.004 --> 13:15.673
We don't need any coffee.
Let's just walk around the campus.

13:15.707 --> 13:17.675
I really need to study.

13:17.709 --> 13:19.777
No you don't. And you just said
you were going to walk around.

13:19.812 --> 13:21.879
We'll walk around with you.

13:21.914 --> 13:23.881
What, did you promise Amy you wouldn't
hang out with me or something?

13:23.916 --> 13:26.884
No. Then relax dude, this
is gonna be a fun year.

13:26.919 --> 13:28.019
You forgot your phone.

13:28.720 --> 13:29.787
Thanks.

13:33.892 --> 13:35.059
You're not going to tip her?

13:35.094 --> 13:36.928
I tipped at the counter.
I'll go tip her.

13:36.962 --> 13:38.062
Just leave it alone.

13:38.097 --> 13:40.765
Jack's right,
this is going to be fun.

13:40.799 --> 13:42.066
Especially for
you it looks like.

13:42.101 --> 13:43.868
She's someone
I knew in a foster home.

13:43.902 --> 13:44.936
She was like a sister to me.

13:44.970 --> 13:46.704
Then introduce me.
She's hot.

13:46.738 --> 13:47.839
Let's just go.

13:47.873 --> 13:48.940
Let's.

13:53.912 --> 13:57.181
Coach is trying to get me to say I'm
a Christian before Saturday's game.

13:57.216 --> 14:01.018
Why is that? Eh, he just thinks
it's a good public image.

14:01.053 --> 14:04.889
And it'll psyche out the other team
if they think God is on our side.

14:04.923 --> 14:07.058
You're not going to do that, are you?
Lie about something like that.

14:07.092 --> 14:08.960
As serious as that.

14:08.994 --> 14:11.863
Like you're going to tell Amy about
knowing that waitress? Yeah. I am.

14:11.897 --> 14:13.698
Describe her
to me without lying.

14:13.732 --> 14:15.666
I told you. She's a girl I lived
with when I was in foster care.

14:15.701 --> 14:17.034
We were at the same house
for not even a year.

14:17.069 --> 14:18.769
Did you have sex with her?

14:18.804 --> 14:20.004
No. I didn't.
We were too young

14:20.038 --> 14:22.940
and too messed up and it
wasn't exactly a good home.

14:22.975 --> 14:24.675
No. We did not have sex.

14:24.710 --> 14:25.743
I'd have sex with her.

14:25.777 --> 14:27.044
You're supposed
to be a Christian.

14:27.079 --> 14:28.980
Yeah, but not that
kind of Christian.

14:29.014 --> 14:31.749
I'm a Christian who has sex if
I'm in a committed relationship.

14:31.783 --> 14:34.752
Oh! Give it up and just go to
church and have sex with Grace.

14:34.786 --> 14:36.154
You know you both want to.

14:36.188 --> 14:38.756
She says she's not going
to do it again until...

14:38.790 --> 14:40.825
Can we just make an agreement not to spend
the next four years talking about sex?

14:40.859 --> 14:42.760
Have we not grown up at all
during the last four years?

14:45.931 --> 14:47.999
Boy, he is so married.

14:48.967 --> 14:50.067
Guess we'll see, huh?

14:50.102 --> 14:52.136
We got to get this
Operation Tebow moving.

14:52.171 --> 14:54.038
We got a game coming up.

14:54.072 --> 14:57.975
Grace is working on it, but Jack's
not being very cooperative.

14:58.010 --> 15:01.112
Can't Grace be a little
more persuasive?

15:01.146 --> 15:03.748
I don't think that's allowed.

15:03.982 --> 15:05.716
All right.

15:06.852 --> 15:09.020
This team needs an extra boost.

15:09.054 --> 15:11.789
I've got a hunch this Christian
angle is going to do it

15:11.823 --> 15:13.124
'cause God knows
we've tried everything else.

15:13.158 --> 15:15.726
Don't worry.
It's going to happen.

15:15.761 --> 15:16.827
I'm going to make it happen.

15:16.862 --> 15:17.929
That's the spirit.

15:28.330 --> 15:30.689
Hey, Margie.
Oh, let me just grab my coat

15:30.822 --> 15:33.771
and roll the calls over
and we're on our way.

15:33.865 --> 15:35.204
What do you think of the place?

15:35.617 --> 15:37.568
Very impressive.

15:37.940 --> 15:40.486
And don't you look
good behind that desk.

15:40.820 --> 15:42.616
Nora, I hope you're
proud of yourself.

15:42.712 --> 15:45.048
You're doing really well.

15:45.345 --> 15:49.029
And it's Margaret, not Margie,
but that's a very cute name.

15:49.111 --> 15:50.461
Someone's in a good mood.

15:50.553 --> 15:54.061
Well, I was going to wait until we're
at lunch to tell you, but I can't!

15:54.247 --> 15:57.857
Shakur and I are going to have
a big wedding for the kids,

15:57.964 --> 15:59.695
isn't that exciting?

15:59.818 --> 16:03.565
Uh, yeah. Is it before
or after the wedding.

16:03.645 --> 16:05.161
Anne is going to have
for the two of 'em?

16:05.266 --> 16:06.661
What wedding?

16:06.714 --> 16:08.224
Oh, shoot.
She didn't tell you?

16:08.332 --> 16:10.537
Tell me what?
She's not having a wedding for them.

16:10.657 --> 16:11.942
I think she is.

16:12.034 --> 16:13.496
No, she's not.

16:13.600 --> 16:15.827
Shakur and I are doing that.

16:15.862 --> 16:17.395
We're going to have elephants.

16:17.486 --> 16:21.422
The bride and groom are going
to ride in on elephants.

16:21.457 --> 16:25.326
And Shakur's family is coming
and my family is coming.

16:25.361 --> 16:28.296
Real elephants?
Like at the zoo?

16:28.330 --> 16:30.498
Real elephants.

16:30.533 --> 16:34.702
A real wedding.
A big party for five hundred people.

16:34.737 --> 16:36.504
That's crazy!

16:36.539 --> 16:38.506
I love that idea!
I want to go to your wedding!

16:38.541 --> 16:39.574
What does Ricky say?

16:39.608 --> 16:42.710
I wanted to tell you
and Anne first.

16:42.745 --> 16:45.713
I was going to give her the
courtesy of being part of it all.

16:45.748 --> 16:49.317
Apparently she didn't
feel the same way about me.

16:49.351 --> 16:52.754
I think she was just sidetracked
by Ashley, she flew the coop.

16:52.788 --> 16:54.455
She's in Italy.

16:54.490 --> 16:55.590
Oh, boy.

16:56.625 --> 16:58.526
Well, still.

16:58.561 --> 17:01.396
I wish Anne had called me.

17:01.430 --> 17:03.398
I don't want her
to be disappointed.

17:03.432 --> 17:05.300
Me neither.
She's a nice lady.

17:05.334 --> 17:06.568
Yes, she is.

17:06.602 --> 17:09.604
But you're on my side right?

17:09.637 --> 17:12.339
I mean, you're
Ricky's mother too.

17:12.374 --> 17:14.342
Well, I mean, it's tough.

17:14.376 --> 17:15.710
Anne is gay. But...

17:15.743 --> 17:18.680
You've got elephants.
I got to go with you.

17:18.714 --> 17:21.449
We'll talk her into it.

17:21.483 --> 17:24.752
But first, we better
talk to Amy and Ricky.

17:24.787 --> 17:26.654
I don't think they
want a wedding.

17:26.689 --> 17:28.423
Anne just pressured
Ricky into it.

17:28.457 --> 17:30.325
I don't do that.
I know my son.

17:30.359 --> 17:33.561
And I know Ricky
is very happy with Amy

17:33.596 --> 17:35.463
and that he loves our family

17:35.497 --> 17:38.433
and he's going to
be very excited

17:38.467 --> 17:40.335
when I tell him
what we want to do.

17:40.369 --> 17:44.372
And, you can tell that
you are excited also.

17:44.406 --> 17:46.541
So, I'm the closer.

17:46.575 --> 17:48.443
Ah, I don't mind.

17:48.477 --> 17:50.478
I'm going to wear harem pants.
I love those.

17:50.512 --> 17:53.381
Okay, we'll see.
Let's get some lunch.

17:54.450 --> 17:56.351
Nora, I'm sorry.

17:56.385 --> 17:58.653
But uh, I need you
to stay here.

17:58.687 --> 18:01.322
Can you just send
up or something?

18:01.357 --> 18:02.690
I apologize Margaret.

18:02.725 --> 18:05.360
I know the two of you are
supposed to be having lunch,

18:05.394 --> 18:07.428
but I have an emergency.

18:09.365 --> 18:10.698
That's okay, Leo.

18:10.733 --> 18:12.634
You just go and take care of
whatever it is you need to do.

18:12.668 --> 18:14.435
What do you need to do?

18:14.470 --> 18:15.570
I have to go.

18:21.377 --> 18:22.677
What's that about?

18:22.711 --> 18:25.580
As an employee of
Boykewich International,

18:25.614 --> 18:28.583
I cannot discuss...

18:28.617 --> 18:32.453
Any matters relating to Boykewich
business practices or matters

18:32.488 --> 18:34.622
which are deemed
confidential by the company.

18:34.657 --> 18:37.659
That's all right.
But does this have

18:37.693 --> 18:39.661
anything to do with Ben

18:39.695 --> 18:42.397
accusing the student teacher
of being a pervert?

18:42.431 --> 18:44.432
The one that was dating Adrian?

18:44.466 --> 18:46.567
No. How'd you hear that?

18:46.602 --> 18:48.603
The whole school has heard it.

18:48.637 --> 18:50.405
And Ethan's in school.

18:50.439 --> 18:51.706
Well, Miss Smarty Pants,

18:51.740 --> 18:53.408
it has nothing to
do with anyone

18:53.442 --> 18:55.476
being a pervert, it has
to do with the fire.

18:56.612 --> 19:01.416
Oh, the fire at
the high school?

19:01.450 --> 19:03.251
Rats! How do
you do that?

19:03.285 --> 19:04.652
How do you get people
to tell you things?

19:04.687 --> 19:07.288
Don't worry, I'm not
going to say a word.

19:08.724 --> 19:13.461
Would you like
to see some pictures

19:13.495 --> 19:16.297
of the elephants and tents?

19:16.332 --> 19:18.466
Yeah. Wow.

19:18.500 --> 19:22.470
So how did that
fire come about, I wonder?

19:22.504 --> 19:24.772
Bunsen burner, they were
roasting marshmallows...

19:29.578 --> 19:31.346
If we're going to beat
Amy's mother,

19:31.380 --> 19:32.680
we need to start
this right away.

19:32.715 --> 19:35.650
I don't know if we should try
to beat Amy's mother.

19:35.684 --> 19:38.286
I do. We're Amy's
best friends.

19:38.320 --> 19:40.455
You know in her heart of hearts
she wants a real wedding.

19:40.489 --> 19:42.357
I mean, I understand
why they ran off,

19:42.391 --> 19:44.625
they're living together and
they have a child together,

19:44.660 --> 19:47.495
and they wanted to make it all
official without all the hassle.

19:47.529 --> 19:50.498
But this isn't going to be a hassle,
we can do everything for her.

19:50.532 --> 19:52.333
For them.

19:52.368 --> 19:55.336
You know and any wedding that Amy's
mom plans, would be all hassle.

19:55.371 --> 19:58.339
And Amy wants a wedding,
not a hassle.

19:58.374 --> 20:00.541
I'm not sure Amy does
want a wedding.

20:00.576 --> 20:03.444
Look at all the trouble we went
through for that flash mob

20:03.479 --> 20:04.746
and the singing and everything.

20:04.780 --> 20:07.348
I don't think she
was all that impressed.

20:07.383 --> 20:08.516
And that was a lot of work.

20:08.550 --> 20:11.352
I mean, she said
thank you and everything,

20:11.387 --> 20:13.554
but I don't know, she seemed
kind of funny about it.

20:13.589 --> 20:16.691
Maybe that was because
she was shocked and awed.

20:16.725 --> 20:18.659
But this will be
a planned event.

20:18.694 --> 20:20.528
And Amy wants a wedding.

20:20.562 --> 20:22.497
And we want to
give her a wedding.

20:22.531 --> 20:24.565
No. You do.
You want a wedding.

20:24.600 --> 20:26.734
You just want to wear
that sparkly dress again.

20:26.769 --> 20:28.436
We did look hot.

20:28.470 --> 20:30.538
But it's not about
a sparkly dress.

20:30.572 --> 20:34.742
I just... I just don't
want to let go of her.

20:34.777 --> 20:37.545
We were the first people she
told when she was pregnant.

20:37.579 --> 20:39.447
Even before she
told her mother.

20:39.481 --> 20:41.349
We've been
best friends forever.

20:41.383 --> 20:43.584
And after this year, everyone is just
going to go their separate ways.

20:43.619 --> 20:44.719
Maybe not.

20:44.753 --> 20:47.655
Maybe we'll all end up at
the same college together.

20:47.689 --> 20:49.390
Lauren, you're not
going to stay here,

20:49.425 --> 20:51.559
you'll be going away,
to some big fancy school.

20:51.593 --> 20:53.728
You can go away to some big
fancy school with me.

20:55.831 --> 20:58.399
No! You are not going
to stay here and

20:58.434 --> 20:59.500
go to school where Jack goes,

20:59.535 --> 21:00.635
just hoping to get him back!

21:00.669 --> 21:01.736
But I miss him.

21:01.770 --> 21:03.538
I know. I miss Jesse.

21:03.572 --> 21:06.441
But how stupid would
we be to make

21:06.475 --> 21:09.777
decisions about what college we want
to go to based on our old boyfriends?

21:09.812 --> 21:11.579
I may be that stupid.

21:11.613 --> 21:12.680
No, you're not.

21:12.714 --> 21:15.483
I just hope someone
wants to marry me someday.

21:15.517 --> 21:16.717
Someone will.

21:16.752 --> 21:19.754
But Madison, it's too
soon, it's way too soon.

21:20.556 --> 21:22.557
We're not Amy.

21:22.591 --> 21:25.693
We've got years to enjoy before
we settle down and get married

21:25.727 --> 21:27.462
and have kids

21:27.496 --> 21:29.597
and maybe in a few years
we won't even want that.

21:29.631 --> 21:31.566
Maybe marriage and babies

21:31.600 --> 21:34.635
are easier to think about than
being personally successful

21:34.670 --> 21:38.539
in a field that we've
yet to even know exists.

21:38.574 --> 21:43.377
It's easy to think about guys
and weddings and all that stuff

21:43.412 --> 21:46.547
it's hard to picture
starting a business

21:46.582 --> 21:50.451
or inventing something that will make
a real contribution to the world.

21:50.853 --> 21:53.454
It's even hard to imagine

21:53.489 --> 21:55.389
that maybe someday

21:55.424 --> 21:58.593
we may have the opportunity to
travel the world on our own

21:58.627 --> 22:02.730
and get to meet new people from different
cultures and different countries.

22:02.764 --> 22:05.466
Those are the kinds of things
we should be dreaming about.

22:05.501 --> 22:08.736
Yeah. I'd like to meet
a guy from Madrid.

22:08.770 --> 22:11.572
Or Amsterdam.
Or Mongolia.

22:11.607 --> 22:14.642
You know, those Mongolian guys are
really macho with their little ponies,

22:14.676 --> 22:16.410
riding across the tundra,

22:16.445 --> 22:17.678
killing those rats and stuff.

22:19.615 --> 22:22.416
Hey, Madison, could I talk
to you about something?

22:22.451 --> 22:23.684
We're talking.
Sorry.

22:23.719 --> 22:26.354
That's okay, what do you want?

22:26.388 --> 22:27.588
A little privacy?

22:27.623 --> 22:30.424
Oh, for Pete's sake. We're seniors.
You're a freshman.

22:30.459 --> 22:33.327
I need some advice about
something. It's personal.

22:33.362 --> 22:34.662
Okay.
From her.

22:36.698 --> 22:37.798
Good luck.

22:40.335 --> 22:41.402
Can I ask you a question?

22:41.436 --> 22:42.637
I hope so, after all that.

22:42.671 --> 22:44.672
And I hope you're
not hitting on me again.

22:44.706 --> 22:47.575
No, I just want to ask your
advice as an older woman.

22:48.677 --> 22:52.480
Do girls who have
had sex, do they

22:53.582 --> 22:56.617
well, do they ever want
to have sex with a guy

22:56.652 --> 22:58.686
who hasn't had a lot of sex,

22:58.720 --> 23:01.389
with other people, women?

23:01.423 --> 23:03.457
Because if not,
what I was wondering was...

23:03.492 --> 23:06.561
Watch it. I'm not hitting
on you, it's just that...

23:08.530 --> 23:12.533
I'm sure you could maybe teach me a thing
or two, purely on a friendship basis,

23:12.568 --> 23:16.370
or even on a
I-would-pay-you-basis.

23:16.405 --> 23:20.374
Not that it wouldn't be pleasurable
for both of us, as well as safe.

23:20.409 --> 23:22.743
And I might add, I respect you,
that's why I have come to you.

23:22.778 --> 23:26.581
That and the only other girl I
really know at school is Amy.

23:26.615 --> 23:28.382
Get out of here!
Are you sure?

23:28.417 --> 23:31.485
Fine! I'll get
out of here.

23:31.520 --> 23:32.720
I'm not some kind of hooker.

23:34.489 --> 23:37.325
I mean, I'm just naturally sexy

23:37.359 --> 23:39.760
which doesn't mean I have sex
with every guy I go out with.

23:41.763 --> 23:43.564
It must be the blonde hair.

23:46.735 --> 23:49.437
You won't believe what that
Ethan guy just asked me!

23:49.471 --> 23:50.671
Maybe I would.

23:50.706 --> 23:52.506
He asked me if a
girl who has had sex

23:52.541 --> 23:53.708
would still have sex with
a guy who hasn't had sex

23:53.742 --> 23:55.443
and then offered
to pay me money.

23:55.477 --> 23:57.778
That little...
I'm going to have Ricky talk to him.

23:57.813 --> 24:00.448
He's hitting on that girl
I'm supposed to be mentoring.

24:00.482 --> 24:02.450
Oh. The pregnant one.

24:02.484 --> 24:04.585
I get it, he wants
to have sex with her

24:04.620 --> 24:06.487
and she's obviously
had sex and...

24:06.521 --> 24:08.522
And obviously
he's out of his mind

24:08.557 --> 24:10.458
because that is not
going to happen.

24:10.492 --> 24:13.594
Not as long as my mentor
lungs are still breathing.

24:13.629 --> 24:16.330
Is this a good time to talk
to you about the party.

24:16.365 --> 24:18.366
The kind of wedding thing?

24:22.337 --> 24:24.605
No. Madison,
do not start with that.

24:24.640 --> 24:26.574
I don't want a wedding
or anything like a wedding.

24:26.608 --> 24:28.643
I don't want my mother
to do anything

24:28.677 --> 24:31.379
or Ricky's mothers to do anything
or my best friends to do anything.

24:31.413 --> 24:32.413
All right?

24:39.080 --> 24:41.066
She went over there and she
took Rabi with her.

24:41.173 --> 24:42.288
Not me, Rabi.

24:42.891 --> 24:43.825
I don't even get
to yell at Ashle

24:43.859 --> 24:45.893
all I get is to capitalize
my text messages

24:45.928 --> 24:49.397
while the two of them are looking for an
apartment and shopping and eating spaghetti.

24:49.399 --> 24:51.566
I'm kind of glad you didn't
go to Italy with Anne,

24:52.568 --> 24:54.535
while the two of them are looking for an
apartment and shopping I'd be really jealous.

24:54.570 --> 24:56.237
It's not like we would
have been fooling around.

24:56.271 --> 24:57.505
You never know.
I know.

24:59.541 --> 25:01.209
So I guess the
wedding is on hold?

25:01.243 --> 25:02.477
There's not going to be a
wedding, there already was

25:02.511 --> 25:04.212
a wedding and that's the
only wedding I'm paying for.

25:04.246 --> 25:06.214
Maybe Anne will want to pay
for it all by herself.

25:06.248 --> 25:08.216
How's she going to do that?
Do you know how much weddings cost?

25:08.250 --> 25:09.550
Every time I talk to her, she's
got bigger and bigger ideas.

25:09.585 --> 25:11.452
The guest list is up to
two hundred and fifty people

25:11.487 --> 25:13.654
and she's looking at some place
on the beach near Santa Barbara.

25:13.689 --> 25:15.490
I don't know how she thinks
she'd pay for all that.

25:15.524 --> 25:17.525
Oh, I don't know.
I guess she could sell the house.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.194
It's just you now.

25:20.229 --> 25:21.395
You and Nora.

25:21.430 --> 25:23.164
Anne's not going
to sell that house.

25:23.198 --> 25:25.166
She cried when I switched out
the kitchen counter tops.

25:25.200 --> 25:27.435
You did those
granite counter tops?

25:27.469 --> 25:29.570
I did.
Wow.

25:29.605 --> 25:31.472
I guess I didn't realize that
you did that kind of thing.

25:31.507 --> 25:34.375
Sure I do. You want something done around here?
I'd love a project.

25:34.409 --> 25:37.378
I'd love to get the
wallpaper down in here.

25:37.412 --> 25:40.248
I can paint, but I don't think I
can remove the paper by myself.

25:40.282 --> 25:43.050
I can take down the paper and paint,
and you don't have to lift a finger.

25:43.085 --> 25:45.353
No, no, I'd want to help. Then let's do it.
Let's do it right now.

25:45.387 --> 25:47.155
Really?

25:47.189 --> 25:48.389
Yeah, I'll run home and grab some
tools, back in five minutes.

25:48.423 --> 25:49.457
Okay.

25:49.491 --> 25:51.325
Mmm.

25:51.360 --> 25:53.394
Wait, George, I have
something to tell you.

25:53.428 --> 25:55.229
Oh yeah?
What's that?

25:55.264 --> 25:57.198
The divorce papers
came through.

25:57.232 --> 26:00.234
Yeah?
Yeah, and here's the thing...

26:00.269 --> 26:03.304
Don't come back in five minutes,
don't start any projects with me,

26:03.338 --> 26:05.273
unless...

26:05.307 --> 26:09.110
Well, unless you're really serious
about me and not just trying

26:09.144 --> 26:11.179
to have sex with me for ol'
time sake or something.

26:11.213 --> 26:13.314
I am serious about you.
You know that.

26:13.348 --> 26:16.417
I know I said that we had to wait until I
got divorced, but now that I am divorced,

26:16.451 --> 26:20.154
I just don't feel comfortable
jumping right into bed with you.

26:22.191 --> 26:26.394
How do you feel about that?
I feel hurt. I feel disappointed.

26:26.428 --> 26:29.297
I feel that you lied to me
about something I really think

26:29.331 --> 26:30.531
is the biggest part
of any adult relationship.

26:30.566 --> 26:33.301
Really? I'm joking. Pretty much.

26:33.335 --> 26:36.037
Pretty much? As much as I want
to jump into bed with you,

26:36.071 --> 26:37.505
what I really want is
for us to be happy together.

26:37.539 --> 26:40.107
Meaning?

26:40.142 --> 26:42.376
I was with Anne for
almost twenty years

26:42.411 --> 26:44.378
with and we've had
three children together

26:44.413 --> 26:46.280
and it never felt like
we were married.

26:46.315 --> 26:48.115
And not because she was gay,

26:48.150 --> 26:50.518
although I can now see how
that might figure into it.

26:50.552 --> 26:54.155
I just, I got married
because we had Amy.

26:54.189 --> 26:56.457
And then we had Ashley.
And then we got divorced and then we had Robie.

26:56.491 --> 27:00.294
It's always felt as if we had to be
married whether we wanted to or not.

27:00.329 --> 27:04.031
This time I want to be married
because we both want to be married

27:04.066 --> 27:06.300
and we love each other
and we respect each other

27:06.335 --> 27:09.503
and we want to be together
for the rest of our lives.

27:09.538 --> 27:13.374
I want to spend the rest of
my life with you, Kathleen.

27:16.078 --> 27:18.179
I'm going to go get my tools.

27:26.154 --> 27:27.288
It's not a good
idea, all right?

27:27.322 --> 27:29.357
I know him.
He's not for you.

27:29.391 --> 27:31.359
And you don't need
to be dating right now.

27:31.393 --> 27:35.029
You just need to focus on your baby
and your health and your classes.

27:35.063 --> 27:36.998
You can't get behind
in your classes,

27:37.032 --> 27:38.399
you're already a year behind
where you're supposed to be.

27:38.433 --> 27:40.101
Don't throw that in my face,

27:40.135 --> 27:42.203
I've moved around a lot.
My dad's in the CIA.

27:42.237 --> 27:44.405
Should you be telling me that?
Isn't that confidential information?

27:44.439 --> 27:47.208
I'm going to tell you anything I
have to to get you away from me

27:47.242 --> 27:49.010
so I can go talk
to my new friend.

27:49.044 --> 27:51.045
I'm not sure Ethan is
capable of being a friend,

27:51.079 --> 27:53.047
and he should be focusing
on his classes as well.

27:53.081 --> 27:56.217
He's really cute. And I'm sick of sitting
around the house with my grandmother.

27:56.251 --> 28:00.087
Then I'll try to do something with
you, but it has to be on a Saturday.

28:00.122 --> 28:01.389
I work after school

28:01.423 --> 28:03.424
and the only time
I have is on weekends

28:03.458 --> 28:05.293
and then I try to catch up
with my homework while doing

28:05.327 --> 28:07.128
laundry over at
my parents' house.

28:07.162 --> 28:09.463
I'm sorry, was that an invitation
to hang out or a cautionary tale?

28:09.498 --> 28:11.232
You can bring your homework
and we'll do it together.

28:11.266 --> 28:14.368
Will the kid be there?
John? Yeah, of course.

28:14.403 --> 28:16.404
Nah, I don't want to.

28:16.438 --> 28:18.272
I don't want to meet your kid,

28:18.307 --> 28:20.308
it would be like you're trying to
talk me into not giving up my baby.

28:20.342 --> 28:23.144
No, I'm not.
That's not what I'm doing at all.

28:23.178 --> 28:26.347
I'm sure the family you have for
her is a very loving family

28:26.381 --> 28:30.117
and they're the right
choice for your baby.

28:30.152 --> 28:33.154
Look, I don't think
you're doing the wrong thing

28:33.188 --> 28:34.455
by allowing your baby
to be adopted.

28:34.489 --> 28:37.158
Then why didn't you?
Because I didn't, okay?

28:37.192 --> 28:38.326
Everyone should have a choice.

28:38.360 --> 28:40.394
A choice to have
the baby or not,

28:40.429 --> 28:45.099
a choice to allow the baby to
be adopted or keep the baby.

28:45.133 --> 28:47.435
These are very personal decisions
and they are never easy,

28:47.469 --> 28:49.203
I'm sure it's not easy on you.

28:59.314 --> 29:00.314
Oh, no!

29:02.250 --> 29:03.284
What's wrong?

29:03.318 --> 29:05.252
No, no, oh, no.

29:05.287 --> 29:08.022
What? I think someone
broke into my locker.

29:08.056 --> 29:10.157
You made it pretty easy,
your lock wasn't locked.

29:10.192 --> 29:13.260
Which makes it even worse.
I have no one to blame but myself.

29:13.295 --> 29:16.130
You're going to have to ge a new
license, new credit cards...

29:16.164 --> 29:17.398
New husband.

29:29.140 --> 29:32.248
I can't believe we're doing this!
I am so excited.

29:32.283 --> 29:35.026
I never liked that wallpaper,
Marshall picked it out.

29:35.061 --> 29:37.028
Sorry. I didn't mean
to bring up his name.

29:37.063 --> 29:39.764
You can bring up his name
any time you want.

29:39.799 --> 29:42.000
Pretty dainty wallpaper
for a player.

29:42.034 --> 29:43.969
Speaking of which, where's his son?
When is he coming back?

29:44.003 --> 29:46.104
Jacob? I don't know.

29:46.138 --> 29:49.875
I like him and I'm happy
we got to meet each other

29:49.909 --> 29:51.810
and that he and Tom and
Grace are friends.

29:51.844 --> 29:54.846
And if you had never met him and never
found out, you'd be even happier?

29:54.881 --> 29:56.882
No. It's good
to know the truth.

29:59.018 --> 30:01.052
Ah, is that what's
going on here?

30:01.087 --> 30:03.955
You're seeking the truth
through wallpaper?

30:03.990 --> 30:05.824
Why are you taking
down the wallpaper?

30:05.858 --> 30:08.026
This was Dad's favorite thing in the
house, he picked it out himself.

30:08.060 --> 30:09.861
It was like the one
decision you let him make.

30:09.896 --> 30:12.664
Oh, he made some other
decisions without me, Grace.

30:12.698 --> 30:15.100
Sorry, Grace, I guess we
took you by surprise.

30:15.134 --> 30:17.903
It was just kind of spur of the moment.
The wallpaper was peeling off

30:17.937 --> 30:19.938
and your mom just wanted to get rid of it.
No offense to your dad.

30:19.972 --> 30:22.040
I'm sorry. I can not get used
to you being in our house.

30:22.074 --> 30:24.009
Christian or not,
I'm still human!

30:26.178 --> 30:28.179
I'm sorry. I'm going
to go talk to her.

30:28.214 --> 30:29.848
I got it.

30:44.864 --> 30:46.197
Sorry about that.

30:46.232 --> 30:49.034
About flaunting my relationship
with your mother in your face.

30:49.068 --> 30:50.802
That was wrong of me.

30:50.836 --> 30:52.837
Yeah. It was.
It was completely insensitive.

30:52.872 --> 30:56.107
I feel really bad about taking down the
wallpaper, we should have asked you about it.

30:56.142 --> 30:59.711
That's the wallpaper you grew up with and
even though it was falling off the walls,

30:59.745 --> 31:02.714
still, it's your house,
it's not my house.

31:02.748 --> 31:05.951
It's really my mother's house and I guess
she can do whatever she wants to it,

31:05.985 --> 31:08.019
including having you take down
the wallpaper in the kitchen.

31:08.054 --> 31:09.788
Why don't you come back in?

31:09.822 --> 31:12.157
Nah. I'm not really good
at that stuff like that.

31:12.191 --> 31:13.892
Is there anything you'd
like to do in here?

31:13.926 --> 31:17.162
In here? No. I don't know.

31:17.196 --> 31:19.097
I don't really want you
to do anything for me.

31:19.131 --> 31:21.900
I wasn't volunteering, I was just thinking
that maybe your boyfriend Jack...

31:21.934 --> 31:24.102
He's not my boyfriend.
Your old boyfriend Jack,

31:24.136 --> 31:26.905
he's pretty handy, he could probably
paint or hang some shelves or something.

31:26.939 --> 31:30.175
He's busy, he's has football,
he's got a whole new life

31:30.209 --> 31:32.711
over on the big college campus.

31:32.745 --> 31:34.079
Plus he doesn't care about me.

31:34.113 --> 31:35.914
He just wants to
have sex with me.

31:35.948 --> 31:37.148
And I'm not into that anymore.

31:37.183 --> 31:39.784
That's why I was suggesting
doing something else together.

31:39.819 --> 31:41.786
Oh, I get it.
Now I get it.

31:41.821 --> 31:44.155
You're taking down the wallpaper just
so you can have sex with my mother!

31:44.190 --> 31:47.025
No, I'm taking down the wallpaper
because I want to be with your mother

31:47.059 --> 31:49.094
for the rest of my life.

31:49.128 --> 31:52.063
And I'm telling you that now, so you won't
be surprised if things work out later.

31:52.098 --> 31:53.164
We might even go to church.

31:54.767 --> 31:56.134
I got to get back to work.

32:08.914 --> 32:10.815
Henry? What are
you doing here?

32:10.850 --> 32:12.083
We talked about your
not dropping by.

32:12.118 --> 32:14.152
I know, but Alice
said I should talk to you.

32:14.186 --> 32:17.188
Oh. Uh, well, this
isn't a good time.

32:17.223 --> 32:19.958
My dad called and
told me to meet him here.

32:19.992 --> 32:21.926
Oh yeah?
Is everything all right?

32:21.961 --> 32:23.194
No, Henry.

32:23.229 --> 32:24.996
Everything is not all right.

32:25.031 --> 32:27.866
And since you dropped
by, I might as well tell you.

32:27.900 --> 32:31.169
That you burned down the school?
Alice already told me.

32:31.203 --> 32:33.004
I know you told her and not me.

32:33.039 --> 32:35.006
It's okay.
I understand.

32:35.041 --> 32:36.841
She told you!
Yeah.

32:36.876 --> 32:38.676
And she told me I could
tell you she told me.

32:38.711 --> 32:40.712
Yeah. I should have told
you when I told Alice.

32:40.746 --> 32:43.882
I maybe should have told you
instead of telling Alice,

32:43.916 --> 32:47.685
although that certainly could have
had some strange repercussions.

32:47.720 --> 32:50.055
Dylan and I burned
down her school

32:50.089 --> 32:53.124
or I thought we did and
I went to Adrian's dad

32:53.159 --> 32:55.760
and told him and then the
police got involved and...

32:57.096 --> 33:00.698
I think I could be going
off to jail, I don't know.

33:00.733 --> 33:02.801
I mean, Dylan thinks the worst
thing that's going to happen

33:02.835 --> 33:05.904
is that we're never going to be
able to see each other again, but

33:05.938 --> 33:07.705
I think I could be
going off to jail.

33:07.740 --> 33:12.010
Ben, your dad would never
let anyone put you in prison.

33:12.044 --> 33:15.713
Not for something like burning
down a stupid school.

33:15.748 --> 33:18.883
I mean, there are too many
schools to begin with.

33:18.918 --> 33:22.687
And, and that one?
I mean, it was just a private one.

33:22.721 --> 33:24.956
Not paid for by the taxpayers.

33:24.990 --> 33:26.858
You can stop now, Henry.

33:26.892 --> 33:28.927
No matter how good
a friend you are,

33:28.961 --> 33:34.632
I don't think you can justify the stupid,
irresponsible things I did last summer.

33:34.667 --> 33:35.767
I know I can't.

33:35.801 --> 33:36.968
You burned it down on purpose?

33:37.002 --> 33:42.740
No, I... We, Dylan and I,
burned it down by accident.

33:44.043 --> 33:46.077
You didn't burn down anything.

33:46.112 --> 33:48.913
Hi Henry. I got
to talk to Ben.

33:48.948 --> 33:51.015
I'll call you later, Henry.
Thanks man.

33:53.786 --> 33:55.954
I didn't burn down anything?

33:55.988 --> 33:58.690
No, whatever Miss Dylan
told the cops,

33:58.724 --> 34:01.059
they told the fire department
and this led to them

34:01.093 --> 34:03.928
checking the gas lines
coming into the school again,

34:03.963 --> 34:06.064
the lines were running
too close to the electrical.

34:06.098 --> 34:08.632
Bottom line,
you're off the hook.

34:08.667 --> 34:10.802
With them.
But not with me.

34:10.835 --> 34:12.036
What! It's over?
I'm free?

34:12.071 --> 34:13.670
No. You're not free.

34:13.706 --> 34:16.708
You're restricted to school,
work, and home.

34:16.742 --> 34:19.677
And maybe Alice and Henry.

34:19.712 --> 34:22.013
Oh, my God! I'm innocent?
I didn't do anything?

34:22.047 --> 34:23.648
No, you did.

34:23.681 --> 34:25.083
You stupidly got involved

34:25.117 --> 34:28.920
with a girl who gets some kind of
kick out of living on the edge,

34:28.954 --> 34:33.757
and as of right here and now, I do not
want you hanging out with her ever again.

34:33.792 --> 34:36.728
It's just Alice and
Henry, Henry and Alice.

34:36.762 --> 34:39.664
You never got into any trouble
just hanging out with those two.

34:39.697 --> 34:42.833
Because they're your friends, your
real friends, your best friends.

34:44.069 --> 34:45.603
Oh, no.

34:45.638 --> 34:47.772
All right, I'm going
to start telling the truth.

34:47.806 --> 34:49.774
Good idea.
I slept with Alice.

34:49.808 --> 34:50.975
Slept with Alice as in...

34:51.976 --> 34:54.712
How the hell did that happen?

34:54.746 --> 34:56.848
Never mind. I don't want you
hanging out with anyone

34:56.882 --> 34:59.884
until the School Board matter
is over and then we'll see.

34:59.919 --> 35:01.920
Alice!
Henry doesn't know.

35:01.954 --> 35:03.621
Good. Don't tell him.

35:03.656 --> 35:04.822
There's just one more thing.

35:04.857 --> 35:07.959
Please, Ben, when does it end?

35:07.993 --> 35:10.795
I promised God that
if I got off,

35:10.829 --> 35:13.831
if I didn't get arrested for
arson, that I'd go to church.

35:13.866 --> 35:16.901
Well, God's used to that
sort of thing I imagine.

35:16.936 --> 35:18.036
So don't worry about it.

35:18.070 --> 35:19.671
I don't know Dad, I mean...

35:19.705 --> 35:21.673
Maybe I could go to hell for.

35:21.707 --> 35:23.174
For that fire.

35:23.209 --> 35:26.044
But not for sleeping with one best
friend and lying to the other one?

35:32.545 --> 35:33.976
Ricki, you home?

35:40.552 --> 35:42.653
Hi. My mother just called,

35:42.688 --> 35:44.555
she wants you to call her.

35:44.589 --> 35:47.391
Oh? Your mother?
Margaret. Yeah.

35:47.426 --> 35:49.293
Oh, did she say what she wants?

35:49.328 --> 35:51.629
She wants to talk to you, she
sounded kind of excited.

35:51.663 --> 35:53.297
In a good way?

35:53.332 --> 35:54.665
I think so.
Are you okay?

35:54.700 --> 35:56.334
Yeah, I'm okay.

35:56.368 --> 35:58.436
I think she may be
calling about Ethan,

35:58.470 --> 35:59.704
I'll talk to her later.

35:59.738 --> 36:01.539
How was your
first day at school?

36:01.573 --> 36:04.608
Good, pretty much like
high school with a lawn.

36:04.643 --> 36:06.711
But, um,

36:06.745 --> 36:08.546
look I want to tell
you something.

36:08.580 --> 36:10.614
I ran into a girl
named Clementine

36:10.649 --> 36:12.416
that I was in
a foster home with,

36:12.451 --> 36:13.684
she works in the coffee shop.

36:13.719 --> 36:15.619
Oh. That's nice.

36:15.654 --> 36:18.422
I guess.
Did she stay in foster care?

36:18.457 --> 36:20.358
I didn't really ask her,
I had to get to class.

36:20.392 --> 36:21.759
The one class I have
with Jack and Adrian.

36:21.793 --> 36:23.561
How's Adrian?
She's okay.

36:23.595 --> 36:25.296
I just have the
one class with her.

36:25.330 --> 36:27.665
And Jack? He's all caught
up with football season.

36:27.699 --> 36:30.701
Okay, well, there's something
I need to tell you.

36:30.736 --> 36:32.203
What's that?

36:32.237 --> 36:34.338
Well, it seems
as if I... Um...

36:36.641 --> 36:40.344
To me, I mean, I don't know...
I'm just guessing,

36:42.347 --> 36:44.682
Margaret was probably
calling about Ethan.

36:44.716 --> 36:48.619
Ethan was hitting on
my little mentoree today

36:48.653 --> 36:51.589
and now she
likes him, apparently.

36:51.623 --> 36:53.457
I don't know why
my mother would care,

36:53.492 --> 36:54.692
she did sound like
she's in a good mood

36:54.726 --> 36:56.394
so maybe she's happy
he has a friend.

36:56.428 --> 36:58.229
You think so?

36:58.263 --> 37:00.531
I don't know.
I mean, isn't the dad back in Houston?

37:00.565 --> 37:01.699
The baby's being
adopted, right?

37:01.733 --> 37:03.300
Right. Yeah.

37:03.335 --> 37:05.436
So...

37:05.470 --> 37:08.272
What? Ethan shouldn't be her friend?
She shouldn't be Ethan's friend?

37:08.306 --> 37:11.242
No. It's just that they've
both been in trouble before

37:11.276 --> 37:12.276
and, you know...

37:15.514 --> 37:19.283
I know sometimes two kids who got
into trouble turn out all right.

37:19.684 --> 37:20.718
Yeah.

37:20.752 --> 37:22.553
Anything else?
Yeah. What's for dinner?

37:22.587 --> 37:24.288
I just ordered Chinese food.

37:24.322 --> 37:26.390
I had class, then I had work,
and I've got to study so...

37:26.425 --> 37:27.425
I didn't cook.
That's okay.

37:27.459 --> 37:29.360
I love Chinese.

37:29.394 --> 37:30.561
You want to talk about the
money while we're waiting?

37:30.595 --> 37:32.463
We can talk about that later,
I want to get changed.

37:32.497 --> 37:34.465
You're looking a little pale,
you sure you're okay?

37:34.499 --> 37:35.633
Yeah, I'm okay.

37:44.309 --> 37:45.543
You want another hit
before I take off?

37:45.577 --> 37:48.512
Oh. No thanks.
I don't usually drink coffee,

37:48.547 --> 37:50.514
I'm kind of getting a headache,

37:50.549 --> 37:53.350
but it is keeping me awake
and I have to study, so...

37:53.385 --> 37:54.585
Look, sister,

37:54.619 --> 37:56.554
I know that you're
not Ricky's wife

37:56.588 --> 37:58.489
but I take it that
you're interested in him,

37:58.523 --> 38:00.458
otherwise you wouldn't be sitting
here drinking coffee all night

38:00.492 --> 38:02.259
and trying to get
chummy with me.

38:02.294 --> 38:05.362
You are so wrong.
Ricky and I are just friends.

38:05.397 --> 38:07.431
We were friends before
he got Amy pregnant,

38:07.466 --> 38:08.566
we go way back.

38:08.600 --> 38:10.534
Well, as long as you
don't go way forward.

38:10.569 --> 38:13.504
He's married and he's happy
and he's doing really well

38:13.538 --> 38:14.705
and you are not going to
screw that up for him.

38:14.739 --> 38:16.307
So you still care.

38:18.610 --> 38:21.679
I have a boyfriend!
Kind of.

38:25.450 --> 38:27.485
Thank you so much
for your help.

38:27.519 --> 38:29.286
After you guys lived
there for so long,

38:29.321 --> 38:30.621
it just didn't feel clean,
you know.

38:30.655 --> 38:32.523
I just thought a nice fresh
coat of paint might help.

38:32.557 --> 38:35.259
Oh, it's no problem, I haven't painted
in a while, it was kind of fun.

38:35.293 --> 38:36.393
You're so nice
to help me, really.

38:36.428 --> 38:38.295
Well, I owe you,
or your mom anyway.

38:38.330 --> 38:39.530
I lived here for free
for a year.

38:39.564 --> 38:40.631
Still.

38:40.665 --> 38:42.266
I got to go, I have
a curfew you know.

38:42.300 --> 38:43.534
No, I didn't realize.

38:43.568 --> 38:45.436
Not that coach would mind me
being late from your place.

38:45.470 --> 38:47.438
No. He probably wouldn't.

38:47.472 --> 38:50.374
Grace, I know he thinks you
might get me back into church

38:50.408 --> 38:53.410
and get me interested in being
a better Christian, but...

38:53.445 --> 38:54.678
A better Christian?

38:54.713 --> 38:57.214
Meaning you're thinking of
yourself as a Christian again?

38:57.249 --> 39:00.417
I wasn't, no. That just
came out wrong.

39:00.452 --> 39:02.686
Um, what I'm
trying to say is...

39:04.256 --> 39:06.524
I love you, Grace,
I still love you,

39:06.558 --> 39:08.526
and I still want
to have sex with you.

39:08.560 --> 39:12.329
And I don't want to be in a relationship
with you without having sex.

39:12.364 --> 39:13.430
Sorry.
Wait.

39:14.499 --> 39:16.534
You love me?
You know I love you.

39:16.568 --> 39:18.302
But I can't
not have sex with you.

39:18.336 --> 39:20.571
Please, Jack. Come on. I just...
It's not right for me.

39:20.605 --> 39:24.408
Not in high school.
I've made too many mistakes in high school.

39:24.442 --> 39:28.579
But we could still make out and
fool around a little, just no sex.

39:28.613 --> 39:30.414
Does fooling around include...

39:30.448 --> 39:31.448
No.

39:33.652 --> 39:35.419
All right.
I'll think about it.

39:35.453 --> 39:37.521
Okay, think about it.

39:37.556 --> 39:38.656
Goodnight.
Goodnight.

39:51.770 --> 39:56.540
Elephants? Uh...
I don't really see Ricky on an elephant.

39:56.575 --> 39:57.741
An elephant?
Who are you talking to?

39:57.776 --> 39:58.776
Your mother.

40:00.478 --> 40:02.346
Yeah, I mean.
I'm open to it,

40:02.380 --> 40:04.381
but you gotta talk to my
mom when she comes back.

40:04.416 --> 40:05.583
Okay. Okay,
goodnight, Mom.

40:07.552 --> 40:09.587
Did you say elephant?
Yes.

40:09.621 --> 40:12.356
Your parents want to have a
traditional Indian wedding

40:12.390 --> 40:13.624
and come in on elephants.

40:15.527 --> 40:17.728
What?
That's ridiculous.

40:17.762 --> 40:18.829
Yeah.

40:20.765 --> 40:23.901
Okay, I have to tell you something.
And it's not good.

40:23.935 --> 40:25.669
Is it worse than
riding an elephant?

40:25.704 --> 40:26.704
Yeah.

40:27.872 --> 40:29.840
I put the money in my purse.

40:29.874 --> 40:33.611
I put my purse in my locker
and I didn't lock it.

40:35.580 --> 40:38.616
When I came back at the end
of the day, it was gone.

40:38.650 --> 40:41.452
I reported it as stolen
then I was late to work

40:41.486 --> 40:42.853
because I had to
talk to a police officer

40:42.887 --> 40:47.524
who told me that I'd never find
it, but he filed a report anyway.

40:47.559 --> 40:49.393
You thought
your purse was stolen

40:49.427 --> 40:51.629
and you lost a thousand dollars and
you're just telling me this now?

41:04.676 --> 41:07.578
Madison dropped it off.
She said you left it at school.

41:08.647 --> 41:11.482
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

41:11.950 --> 41:13.751
It's all here!
All of it!

41:13.785 --> 41:14.818
Give it to me.

41:14.853 --> 41:15.886
We are getting in way too deep.

41:15.920 --> 41:17.855
Give it to me.
I'll put it in the bank.

41:17.889 --> 41:20.691
And if we get forced into riding
elephants, we can flee the country.

41:20.725 --> 41:23.494
I think it sounds kind of fun.

41:23.528 --> 41:25.529
I bet you have
to wear a turban.

41:25.563 --> 41:26.630
We are not having a wedding.

41:26.665 --> 41:28.866
You tell your mom that
and I'll tell mine.

41:31.536 --> 41:34.838
So how long does it take for
the baby belly to go away?

41:34.873 --> 41:37.808
Well, you have to wait for
the baby to get out first.

41:37.842 --> 41:42.413
No, I know that. I just wondered
is it like weeks or months or...

41:42.447 --> 41:45.416
I'm 15. I don't think
it'll take that long.

41:45.450 --> 41:46.850
Why, are you
worried about that?

41:46.885 --> 41:48.652
No, just curious.

41:48.687 --> 41:50.821
I've never known
a pregnant girl before.

41:50.855 --> 41:51.922
Who are you talking to?

41:52.891 --> 41:53.924
No one.

41:57.696 --> 41:59.763
Who was that on the phone?

41:59.798 --> 42:01.665
Not your old boyfriend, I hope.

42:01.700 --> 42:03.767
No, I'm not speaking to him.

42:04.869 --> 42:06.503
It was my new boyfriend.

42:06.538 --> 42:07.571
You met someone?

42:07.605 --> 42:08.772
Yeah,

42:08.807 --> 42:10.474
I think I did.

42:10.508 --> 42:11.508
Cool.

42:11.543 --> 42:12.543
Yeah.

42:13.678 --> 42:14.645
Cool.
