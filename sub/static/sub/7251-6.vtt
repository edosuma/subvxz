WEBVTT

00:00.208 --> 00:04.211
- It's simply disgraceful. 
- For years, we've had peace in the neighborhood.

00:04.359 --> 00:05.813
I knew the Richmonds were going to be trouble

00:05.868 --> 00:07.271
when they missed the block party last month.

00:07.856 --> 00:11.548
I don't understand. They gave out full-size candy bars for Halloween. So what?

00:11.871 --> 00:15.009
Not full-size candy bars, Lorelai - king-size candy bars.

00:15.086 --> 00:17.765
We've been giving out full-size candy bars for years now.

00:17.841 --> 00:20.707
And then those people move in and throw the entire balance of the neighborhood off.

00:20.790 --> 00:22.986
- They made everybody look ridiculous. 
- It's very embarrassing.

00:23.078 --> 00:24.374
I think we have to do something about this -

00:24.476 --> 00:26.073
maybe go to the homeowners association.

00:26.171 --> 00:28.874
Two Halloweens ago, someone painted the Duprees' Chihuahua orange

00:28.935 --> 00:31.306
and nobody went to the homeowners association then.

00:31.424 --> 00:34.413
- Well, everybody hated Taco. 
- I think you're making a little too much of this.

00:34.480 --> 00:37.993
I saw Mae Richmond at Bay Wellington's two weeks before Halloween.

00:38.049 --> 00:40.880
She had ample time to bring it up then, and nothing - not a word.

00:41.547 --> 00:43.390
I think it might be time to go after their ball machine.

00:44.019 --> 00:45.008
Their ball machine?

00:45.267 --> 00:47.059
They have a ball machine on their tennis court

00:47.121 --> 00:50.077
that is extraordinarily loud and unpredictable.

00:50.183 --> 00:52.083
Flying, thumping balls all over the place.

00:52.282 --> 00:54.202
- Flying, thumping what all over the place? 
- Balls.

00:56.301 --> 00:58.898
- You are four. 
- And balls are funny.

00:59.066 --> 01:02.217
Don't worry, Emily. If the homeowners association doesn't do anything,

01:02.293 --> 01:04.504
we'll take this to the neighbors, get a petition going.

01:04.607 --> 01:07.464
Or if that doesn't work, you could throw some hoods on

01:07.582 --> 01:09.834
and burn a full-size Mars bar on their front lawn.

01:09.932 --> 01:11.738
King-size, Lorelai - king-size.

01:11.909 --> 01:13.454
So, how's work, Grandpa?

01:13.607 --> 01:16.752
- Look how smoothly she changes the subject. 
- Work is lovely, Rory.

01:16.926 --> 01:18.472
- How's school? 
- Crazy.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.893
- She's taking too many courses. 
- I am not.

01:21.149 --> 01:22.789
- How many are you taking? 
- Five.

01:23.045 --> 01:24.427
- Is five a lot? 
- It's not a lot

01:24.518 --> 01:25.306
It is a lot.

01:25.434 --> 01:28.102
I took five courses when I was a freshman. Rory takes after me.

01:28.410 --> 01:31.358
- I like to be busy. 
- Idle hands are the devil's playthings.

01:31.466 --> 01:34.103
- That's actually the title of one of her classes. 
- Please don't worry about me.

01:34.195 --> 01:35.895
She says to the mother and the grandmother.

01:36.274 --> 01:37.016
Are you done?

01:37.719 --> 01:38.644
Oh, yes, thank you.

01:38.980 --> 01:41.634
Good, because we have mini lemon bundt cakes for dessert.

01:42.958 --> 01:43.504
What?

01:43.837 --> 01:46.463
Well, they're serving full-size bundt cakes over at the Richmonds' house.

01:46.780 --> 01:48.183
- She's done. 
- Oh, no, I have a carrot.

01:48.321 --> 01:49.081
She's done.

01:51.486 --> 01:53.170
Bet the Richmonds would have let me eat my carrot.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:54.076 --> 02:58.957
- All right, this should do it. 
- May we please get this over with?

02:59.133 --> 03:02.122
- Patience is a virtue, Richard. 
- And time is fleeting, Emily.

03:02.219 --> 03:04.590
You're starting a new partnership. You need new photographs,

03:04.862 --> 03:07.299
- especially with that new look. 
- I thought I'd give a beard a try.

03:07.385 --> 03:10.165
Well, I like it. All right, Helmut, we're all set here.

03:10.264 --> 03:13.284
Okay. Important men doing important things.

03:14.041 --> 03:18.365
Good. One more time. We're going to sign, and...

03:19.306 --> 03:19.899
We're done.

03:20.610 --> 03:21.905
Thank you, Helmut. That was wonderful.

03:22.203 --> 03:24.220
And now we sign the real papers.

03:26.057 --> 03:28.372
- I'm feeling historic. You? 
- Oh, yes.

03:28.858 --> 03:30.435
It's Gettysburg all over again.

03:34.117 --> 03:34.716
Thank you.

03:35.377 --> 03:37.712
Important men doing important things.

03:39.059 --> 03:40.773
Now that makes it official.

03:42.150 --> 03:42.719
Jason.

03:43.538 --> 03:44.763
- Let's give 'em hell. 
- You bet.

03:44.870 --> 03:46.426
Oh, I should have had Helmut get the handshake.

03:46.523 --> 03:48.146
The signing was fine, Emily.

03:48.750 --> 03:50.020
Sorry about the photo session.

03:50.183 --> 03:51.981
Oh, no, that's okay. I think it's a cute idea.

03:52.355 --> 03:56.229
Yes, and when the financial papers call for an official photo, it'll be downright darling.

03:56.394 --> 04:00.356
I learned long ago, Jason, when it comes to things like this, Emily is always right.

04:00.506 --> 04:02.359
- I am sure she is. 
- Thank you both.

04:02.636 --> 04:04.674
Jason, how's your time? Would you like to join us for dinner?

04:04.802 --> 04:07.658
Oh, I'd love to, Emily, but I should get these papers up to my lawyer's office.

04:07.756 --> 04:09.625
- Next week? 
- Consider it an open invitation.

04:09.732 --> 04:11.397
Thank you. Richard, I'll see you tomorrow morning.

04:11.514 --> 04:12.246
Yes, you will.

04:16.670 --> 04:17.637
"I think it's cute."

04:18.303 --> 04:19.368
He's young, Emily.

04:19.671 --> 04:22.757
Yes, well, a good smack on that scruffy face of his would age him up a bit.

04:23.060 --> 04:26.797
All right, let's discuss the launch party. Do you have any sort of particular feel in mind?

04:26.935 --> 04:29.291
Well, I'll leave that to your discretion. Just make sure it's dignified.

04:29.433 --> 04:30.959
We probably shouldn't go too fancy.

04:31.247 --> 04:35.634
Maybe we'll do one of those vodka bars - caviar, a Russian theme.

04:35.835 --> 04:38.337
- I love that it's okay to be Russian again. 
- It sounds lovely.

04:38.595 --> 04:40.115
- How's the 23rd? 
- Perfect.

04:40.483 --> 04:42.622
- And I want you to get a new suit. 
- I don't need a new suit.

04:42.777 --> 04:44.457
And find out what Jason's going to wear.

04:44.553 --> 04:46.791
I don't want the two of you showing up looking like the Bobbsey twins.

04:46.930 --> 04:48.220
Oh, yes, that would be embarrassing.

04:48.521 --> 04:49.704
I'll need a guest list.

04:51.919 --> 04:54.590
A Russian theme. I like that.

04:55.174 --> 04:57.462
The conquering peoples impose their own values

04:57.532 --> 04:59.749
on the subjugated peoples through education,

04:59.843 --> 05:01.977
and quite often through the appointment

05:02.121 --> 05:04.144
of a priesthood from among their own ranks.

05:04.306 --> 05:06.857
This means we should not assume that the system of values

05:06.913 --> 05:09.504
has in some way evolved in a region.

05:09.708 --> 05:12.868
It is almost always imposed with the explicit purpose

05:12.979 --> 05:15.264
of keeping power in the hands of the powerful.

05:15.432 --> 05:19.037
Something to think about until next week, when we will burst more of your illusions...

05:19.687 --> 05:21.994
which brings me to a bit of bad news.

05:22.144 --> 05:23.921
There was an error in the syllabus you received.

05:24.105 --> 05:27.725
The dates were wrong, which means that all of your reading has been pushed up one week.

05:28.427 --> 05:31.863
I apologize for this cruel little life experience, but what can I do?

05:32.124 --> 05:34.162
I just found out my in-laws are moving back to town.

05:34.587 --> 05:36.035
None of us are immune.

05:36.609 --> 05:37.638
I'll see you all Tuesday.

05:42.073 --> 05:45.077
So, we were thinking maybe two horses to start with.

05:45.216 --> 05:46.977
See, it's so charming with the overhang here.

05:47.064 --> 05:48.718
- You want me to turn this into stables? 
- Yes.

05:48.841 --> 05:51.806
- Without a magic wand or some sort of fairy dust? 
- Preferably, yes.

05:52.112 --> 05:55.645
- Let me take a look inside. 
- We'd like to keep the existing structure, please.

05:55.841 --> 05:58.056
Lorelai, I'm all set up as soon as you're ready.

05:58.159 --> 05:59.449
- Be right there, Kirk. 
- Okie dokie.

05:59.567 --> 06:01.887
- How attached are you gonna get to these horses? 
- What?

06:02.087 --> 06:05.449
- You gonna name 'em, feed 'em apples, braid their tails? 
- Why, Tom?

06:05.568 --> 06:08.850
The roof's about to cave in so I can stay within our budget,

06:08.912 --> 06:10.723
but then I'd just call 'em all Trigger.

06:10.810 --> 06:12.782
Just tell me how much more it's gonna cost. 

06:13.069 --> 06:14.671
- Hey, you're here. 
- I'm always here.

06:15.051 --> 06:17.569
Listen, I want to talk to you about something very exciting.

06:17.672 --> 06:19.290
Very exciting. I love very exciting.

06:19.791 --> 06:21.737
This morning I got a call from your mother.

06:22.296 --> 06:24.435
- This is the very exciting? 
- Yes!

06:24.533 --> 06:28.071
She doing a launch party for your father's new business and she wants us to do the catering.

06:28.198 --> 06:30.339
- Us? 
- Us!

06:30.405 --> 06:31.046
- Did you say us? 
- Yes.

06:31.184 --> 06:33.012
- To her. Did you say "us" to her? 
- Yes.

06:33.119 --> 06:35.526
- So she knows about us? 
- Yes, she knows about us, I think.

06:35.684 --> 06:37.948
- What does she know about us? 
- That we have a catering business?

06:38.075 --> 06:39.371
- Yes. 
- Oh, man!

06:39.728 --> 06:41.173
What? Did I do something bad?

06:41.291 --> 06:44.671
No, nothing, nothing. It's my fault. I forgot to tell her.

06:45.091 --> 06:46.145
How could you forget to tell her?

06:46.278 --> 06:48.869
Well, I've only seen her forty or fifty times since we started the business.

06:49.299 --> 06:51.137
Now what did she say exactly?

06:51.286 --> 06:53.231
She asked me to cater, and I said we'd love to,

06:53.318 --> 06:56.134
and then she said, "we?" so I said you and I had started a company,

06:56.195 --> 06:58.186
so it'd be the both of us together, and she said fine.

06:58.294 --> 07:00.061
Was there a pause before "fine" or was it just "fine"?

07:00.215 --> 07:02.703
- I don't remember. I just remember the "fine." 
- She's mad.

07:02.825 --> 07:04.433
- I swear she didn't sound mad. 
- Okay.

07:04.572 --> 07:06.977
- Good. 
- Now let's talk about how much I can't do this.

07:07.071 --> 07:09.964
Look, I knew it would be a thing working for your mother, but it's perfect timing.

07:10.045 --> 07:12.732
This is probably the last job we'll be able to take before I have the baby.

07:12.856 --> 07:15.524
- Something else will come along. 
- Not that pays like your mother does.

07:15.615 --> 07:16.876
You know why she pays so much?

07:17.018 --> 07:19.169
So she can torture you and you won't throw knives at her.

07:19.271 --> 07:20.485
Look, you already know the house.

07:20.561 --> 07:22.947
Decorating, planning - it's gonna be a snap for you.

07:23.552 --> 07:26.491
I bet you can spend ninety percent of the evening in the kitchen,

07:26.684 --> 07:28.372
then we get to take home the pretty, pretty money.

07:28.468 --> 07:29.982
- Sookie. 
- Pretty, pretty money.

07:30.227 --> 07:32.235
Aren't you a big fat wad of pretty money?

07:34.171 --> 07:35.328
- Fine. 
- Really?

07:35.435 --> 07:37.248
- Shouldn't ask again. 
- Accepting and moving on.

07:37.539 --> 07:40.236
- Excuse me, Lorelai. 
- Oh, my God, Kirk, I forgot you were here.

07:40.528 --> 07:42.205
If I had a nickel for every time I heard that.

07:42.347 --> 07:44.431
I'm very, very sorry. You have my full attention.

07:45.046 --> 07:49.438
I'm gonna go. We'll talk tomorrow about the details.

07:49.623 --> 07:51.871
All right, Kirk, show me what you got.

07:52.034 --> 07:54.165
If you'll just follow me, I would like to present you

07:54.252 --> 07:56.688
with my new line of one-of-a-kind mailboxes.

07:57.248 --> 07:59.131
Wow. They look very nice, Kirk.

07:59.254 --> 08:02.997
And whimsical. They say to the world, "I'll take my mail with a smile."

08:03.125 --> 08:04.256
Yes, they do say that.

08:04.348 --> 08:06.647
And since you are one of our preferred customers,

08:06.842 --> 08:08.649
with the purchase of one of our mailboxes,

08:08.880 --> 08:12.641
I'll throw in a carved-duck doorstop and a garlic peeler.

08:12.735 --> 08:16.042
Wow, that's quite an offer, Kirk, but I think it's a little early for me to pick a mailbox.

08:16.184 --> 08:18.065
We haven't even settled on a color for the inn yet.

08:18.198 --> 08:19.846
Well, whimsy goes with everything.

08:19.965 --> 08:21.459
Kirk, I promise, just as soon as...

08:22.637 --> 08:25.188
- is that Condoleezza Rice? 
- Yes, it is.

08:25.350 --> 08:29.032
I'm a fan, and her big mouth is perfect for shoving mail in.

08:29.872 --> 08:32.620
- I'll have to think about it. 
- Fair enough.

08:33.394 --> 08:36.159
So, I hear you're running a catering business now.

08:36.318 --> 08:38.217
Oh, yeah, just temporarily.

08:38.945 --> 08:40.525
- You guys any good? 
- Not bad.

08:40.972 --> 08:45.124
And how much would one have to pay for your culinary services?

08:45.497 --> 08:48.083
It depends, the type of food, number of people, kind of venue.

08:48.185 --> 08:50.511
Simple food, two guests, my mother's living room.

08:50.612 --> 08:51.172
Really?

08:51.309 --> 08:53.095
I have a visitor coming in from out of town

08:53.188 --> 08:55.600
and I thought it would be nice to serve her a catered meal.

08:55.744 --> 08:56.261
Her?

08:56.398 --> 08:58.805
Actually, she was my brother's ex-girlfriend - Lulu.

08:58.907 --> 08:59.707
Good name.

08:59.830 --> 09:03.345
I had sort of a crush on her for a while, and she's coming home to visit her mother,

09:03.514 --> 09:05.721
- and she called me. 
- Kirk, you have a date.

09:05.830 --> 09:09.132
- No, just an appointment to take Lulu to dinner. 
- That's a date.

09:09.285 --> 09:12.881
I don't have high hopes for it, if that's what you're thinking.

09:12.987 --> 09:14.462
Kirk, it's very sweet,

09:14.697 --> 09:17.417
but are you sure you want to have dinner in your living room?

09:17.523 --> 09:19.941
Well, the breakfast nook doesn't seem festive enough.

09:20.078 --> 09:22.776
Right, but while you're having dinner in your living room, where will your mother be?

09:22.879 --> 09:25.153
- Probably in the living room. 
- Is that what you really want?

09:25.296 --> 09:28.164
- To have dinner with your mother watching? 
- I could ask her to face the wall.

09:28.270 --> 09:31.112
Or you could take Lulu out to a restaurant.

09:31.219 --> 09:32.485
- Which one? 
- Well, what does she like?

09:32.587 --> 09:34.666
I don't know. Should I call my brother and find out?

09:34.808 --> 09:36.628
I think if he knew, she'd probably still be with him.

09:36.720 --> 09:37.984
I just really want it to be nice.

09:38.074 --> 09:39.934
Just take her someplace where you're comfortable.

09:40.078 --> 09:42.536
It doesn't have to be fancy. If you like it, she'll like it.

09:42.633 --> 09:45.683
Just not one attached to a bowling alley.

09:45.797 --> 09:47.902
That narrows it down a bit. I'll figure something out.

09:48.014 --> 09:49.105
Good. You'll see - it'll be great.

09:49.315 --> 09:52.566
Do you think I could stop by tomorrow with some wardrobe choices for you to pick out?

09:52.657 --> 09:55.889
Kirk, you can dress yourself. Just look nice.

09:55.996 --> 09:57.850
You know, not too fancy. Clean.

09:59.281 --> 10:00.456
No jeans.

10:02.262 --> 10:03.778
Oh, maybe a sport coat.

10:04.638 --> 10:06.476
- Eleven sound good? 
- Perfect.

10:12.662 --> 10:14.037
A trampoline. That's new.

10:14.218 --> 10:15.324
Helps with my shin splints.

10:17.082 --> 10:19.113
Wow. Squeaky.

10:19.410 --> 10:19.963
Yup.

10:21.098 --> 10:22.306
- Phone. 
- Thanks.

10:28.749 --> 10:29.732
Paris, can you get the phone?

10:31.442 --> 10:32.343
Paris?

10:34.723 --> 10:36.260
- Don't answer it. 
- Why not?

10:36.531 --> 10:37.719
It's Jamie and we're fighting.

10:38.148 --> 10:39.977
Well, does he know you're fighting? 'Cause he's not hanging up.

10:40.227 --> 10:42.133
Oh, he knows. Trust me, he knows.

10:47.636 --> 10:49.597
- You're seriously not gonna answer that? 
- Nope.

10:52.450 --> 10:54.027
- Paris, come on. 
- Fine.

10:55.670 --> 10:56.315
There.

10:57.636 --> 10:59.637
- Why are you and Jamie fighting? 
- Because he's wrong.

10:59.765 --> 11:01.286
- Oh, okay. 
- He won't listen to me.

11:02.122 --> 11:03.177
You won't listen to me!

11:04.405 --> 11:06.151
He's in love with the sound of his own voice.

11:06.289 --> 11:08.717
You'd think he was already president and I don't want to be Hillary.

11:08.839 --> 11:11.184
I don't want to wait for a hundred years while he does his thing

11:11.292 --> 11:13.401
so by the time I get my chance, I'm too old to enjoy it.

11:13.493 --> 11:15.757
- Well, I don't think Hillary's too old to enjoy it. 
- Fine. Be on his side.

11:15.833 --> 11:17.257
I'm not on his side. I'm on her side.

11:18.177 --> 11:18.900
Don't answer it.

11:19.443 --> 11:21.122
- Paris, I have to study! 
- Go ahead.

11:21.623 --> 11:22.796
- I can't! 
- Why not?

11:23.016 --> 11:23.764
The phone.

11:24.614 --> 11:25.495
Don't, Rory! I mean it!

11:26.451 --> 11:29.283
Hello? Hi, Jamie. Yes, she is here.

11:29.564 --> 11:32.355
Paris, you're acting stupid, okay? You love Jamie,

11:32.468 --> 11:36.021
so just get on the phone and work it out so that I can study, okay?

11:37.337 --> 11:38.044
What?

11:38.857 --> 11:40.379
No, I haven't thought about what you said.

11:41.131 --> 11:43.834
Because I'm very busy, Jamie, and contrary to your beliefs,

11:43.900 --> 11:46.732
I have better things to occupy my time with than thinking about you.

11:47.797 --> 11:48.744
Or what you said.

11:49.348 --> 11:51.539
Or what you meant or what you want

11:51.627 --> 11:54.750
or anything about you or concerning you.

11:55.001 --> 11:58.349
Have him call you back on your cell phone. Then you can talk to him outside.

11:58.488 --> 12:01.073
- It's nice outside. There are birds and trees. 
- My cell phone is dead.

12:01.180 --> 12:02.696
- Then take mine. 
- What's your phone plan?

12:03.455 --> 12:03.997
Why?

12:04.269 --> 12:06.768
'Cause I'm not gonna borrow your phone and get slammed with a massive charge

12:06.843 --> 12:08.405
- because your phone plan sucks. 
- Paris!

12:09.839 --> 12:11.983
Jamie, I'm going to call you back on Rory's cell.

12:12.804 --> 12:13.469
Yes, I am.

12:14.130 --> 12:15.978
- Yes, I am! 
- Yes, she is!

12:16.095 --> 12:17.248
- Okay, bye. 
- Here.

12:17.985 --> 12:19.501
- I'll be back. 
- Take your time.

12:39.342 --> 12:42.346
- Tanna, I'm trying to study. 
- Okay.

12:42.519 --> 12:44.941
- I can hear the TV through the wall. 
- Okay.

12:45.177 --> 12:46.432
It's distracting.

12:47.313 --> 12:50.139
- Are you telling me to turn it off? 
- I'm not telling...

12:50.235 --> 12:52.668
You can, you know, because your grandma paid for the TV.

12:52.796 --> 12:55.044
- I'm not telling you to turn the TV off. 
- Because you can.

12:55.182 --> 12:58.127
- The TV belongs to all of us. 
- If it's a matter of volume,

12:58.249 --> 13:00.788
I could press my ear to the speaker and then I could turn it really low.

13:00.896 --> 13:01.491
Never mind.

13:01.634 --> 13:03.943
The problem there is that the speakers for the TV are mounted up

13:04.030 --> 13:07.164
in the corner of the ceiling, but perhaps if I got a ladder.

13:07.271 --> 13:08.145
Never mind, Tanna.

13:09.370 --> 13:10.971
Are you sure you don't want me to turn it off?

13:20.864 --> 13:21.536
Try this one.

13:21.781 --> 13:24.454
Sookie, I love you, I love your cooking, but I swear if you make me eat

13:24.560 --> 13:27.217
one more bite of broccoli tart, I will beat you to death with it.

13:27.448 --> 13:29.911
Your mother is the pickiest woman I have ever catered for.

13:30.127 --> 13:32.266
She has impeccable taste, the highest standards,

13:32.380 --> 13:34.939
and she can smell an inferior tart a mile away.

13:35.123 --> 13:37.238
Depending on how long it's been left out, we all can.

13:37.555 --> 13:39.168
- You know, she still hasn't called yet. 
- She will.

13:39.306 --> 13:42.026
But she was supposed to call about the details a couple of days ago.

13:42.143 --> 13:42.926
She will, Sookie.

13:43.070 --> 13:46.761
But it's coming up and we still don't know if she wants a fish course or a cheese course.

13:46.859 --> 13:49.050
We'll make a fish-cheese combo course just to be sure.

13:49.143 --> 13:50.729
- Lorelai. 
- Why do I have to call her?

13:50.862 --> 13:54.375
Because technically you're doing the organizing, and I've got batter hands.

13:55.680 --> 13:59.105
Oh, ask her about the foie gras. Is it too expected?

13:59.264 --> 14:01.266
'Cause I can make it with a, you know, cherry compote.

14:01.435 --> 14:03.627
Okay. You know what to say.

14:04.932 --> 14:07.631
- Hello, Mom. 
- Lorelai, hello. How nice to hear from you.

14:07.750 --> 14:10.380
- How are you doing? 
- Well, I'm just fine, thank you for asking.

14:10.483 --> 14:13.274
- Good, I'm glad to hear it. 
- And I'm glad to report it.

14:13.349 --> 14:15.690
So the reason I'm calling is we haven't heard from you yet,

14:15.798 --> 14:18.347
and we really need to nail down some of the details of the party.

14:18.449 --> 14:20.667
- "We" haven't heard from you yet? 
- Yes, we - me and Sookie.

14:20.845 --> 14:24.339
- Ah, yes, the Independence Catering Company. 
- So, anyhow...

14:24.440 --> 14:27.701
You know, a few years ago, there was a company called Independent Catering.

14:27.855 --> 14:31.592
They were all the rage until they catered the Kirov benefit for diabetes

14:31.705 --> 14:35.187
that sent 300 people to the hospital with a vicious case of food poisoning.

14:35.453 --> 14:37.839
Well, needless to say, they went out of business immediately,

14:37.941 --> 14:39.750
and I believe one of them left town without packing.

14:39.887 --> 14:42.156
Oh, well, that's a good story. Hans Christian Anderson?

14:42.254 --> 14:45.478
You know, some people could mistake the Independence Catering Company

14:45.576 --> 14:47.550
with the Independent Catering Company,

14:47.649 --> 14:49.523
and that would just be a shame for you, wouldn't it?

14:49.713 --> 14:53.092
Now if I'd known what you were going to name your company, I could have warned you.

14:53.285 --> 14:55.754
- Mom, I swear, I tried to tell you. 
- You did?

14:55.933 --> 14:59.163
Yes, I did. I sent you a flier. Didn't you get my flier?

14:59.388 --> 15:01.217
No, I did not get your flier.

15:01.494 --> 15:04.642
Oh, well, I sent it, and to be honest with you,

15:04.817 --> 15:07.213
I was a little hurt that you didn't call to congratulate me,

15:07.274 --> 15:09.061
but now that I know you didn't get it, I forgive you.

15:09.189 --> 15:11.595
- When did you send a flier? 
- Last week.

15:11.842 --> 15:14.974
- What did it say? 
- Oh, you know... come and get it.

15:15.103 --> 15:17.396
You wrote "come and get it" on your business flier?

15:17.559 --> 15:21.917
No, it was your basic "Introducing the Independence Catering Company", flier.

15:22.005 --> 15:25.778
You know, it had our phone number, our address, and an amusing caricature of us.

15:25.958 --> 15:28.461
- Well, that sounds like a very nice flier. 
- Oh, it was.

15:28.685 --> 15:31.026
Do you have an extra one? You can bring it with you on Friday night.

15:31.503 --> 15:32.496
Sure.

15:32.633 --> 15:35.511
Because it's very unusual these days for things to get lost in the mail.

15:35.675 --> 15:37.524
You don't think you got the address wrong, do you?

15:37.605 --> 15:39.085
- Mom, the party? 
- All right.

15:39.304 --> 15:44.061
I'm going to want a mixture of white, off-white, and cream-colored linen.

15:44.410 --> 15:48.451
A simple bone china with a gold or deep-blue stripe will work.

15:48.655 --> 15:49.510
Okay, got it.

15:49.694 --> 15:53.396
I'm going with tapers cut in half so that people can see each other across the table.

15:53.580 --> 15:57.389
We'll need white and sterling roses, but not too high or formal.

15:57.505 --> 15:59.150
- Do you have a florist? 
- I have a florist.

15:59.391 --> 16:01.951
- Does he have a flier? 
- Do you want clear or silver vases?

16:02.350 --> 16:04.926
- You must think I'm a complete idiot. 
- No, Mom, I don't.

16:05.198 --> 16:06.109
There is no flier.

16:06.482 --> 16:09.278
You're making it up to cover for the fact that you once again

16:09.365 --> 16:11.925
neglected to tell me about an important event in your life.

16:12.038 --> 16:15.181
- Mom, I swear there's a flier. 
- Shame on you for swearing there's a flier.

16:15.280 --> 16:16.666
That's the worst possible thing you could do.

16:16.845 --> 16:20.758
Liv Tyler grew up her entire life thinking Todd Rundgren was her real father.

16:20.870 --> 16:22.969
You think that might knock this out of first place?

16:23.148 --> 16:26.650
I tell you, if I saw this kind of behavior from some other company I was hiring,

16:26.758 --> 16:28.811
- I would fire them on the spot. 
- Then fire us, Mom.

16:28.986 --> 16:30.245
Excuse me?

16:30.387 --> 16:31.873
You are not hiring your daughter and her friend,

16:31.957 --> 16:34.566
you are hiring a professional catering company. This is not a favor,

16:34.648 --> 16:37.879
it is a business transaction, and I must insist that you treat us

16:37.956 --> 16:39.824
exactly as you would any other person off the street.

16:40.050 --> 16:41.861
- As you wish. 
- Thank you.

16:42.241 --> 16:45.416
Now I'm sorry, but we're very busy with preparations for your event,

16:45.569 --> 16:47.494
so I'm gonna have to hang up now. Goodbye, Mother.

16:47.724 --> 16:48.513
Goodbye.

16:49.983 --> 16:51.314
Horrible woman!

16:52.175 --> 16:53.978
You forgot to ask about the menu.

16:54.377 --> 16:57.034
My dorm room has turned into a "Three Stooges" movie.

16:57.140 --> 16:59.198
Shove Pop Tarts under the door in two hours please.

16:59.437 --> 17:00.198
Honey...

17:00.806 --> 17:02.040
You quiched my room.

17:02.369 --> 17:05.082
- They're not quiche. They're broccoli tarts. 
- Well, then you tarted up my room.

17:05.231 --> 17:06.977
I'm sorry, honey, I didn't know you were coming home today.

17:07.073 --> 17:08.952
Sookie's just trying some things out for Grandma's party.

17:09.086 --> 17:11.376
How am I supposed to study when it smells like broccoli?

17:11.488 --> 17:14.294
- Well, study in the living room. 
- This is not living room study.

17:14.421 --> 17:17.202
This is serious bedroom study. I have a ton of work to do.

17:17.308 --> 17:20.806
Hey, here's a crazy thought - isn't there someplace at Yale you can study?

17:20.950 --> 17:24.021
- Don't they have like a hundred libraries? 
- Yes, but they don't have that right vibe.

17:24.138 --> 17:27.021
They're too quiet and too big and drafty. Very, very drafty.

17:27.104 --> 17:29.694
- At least they don't smell like quiche. 
- Enough with the quiche, okay?

17:29.766 --> 17:31.865
I can't believe I came all the way home and there's nowhere to work.

17:31.983 --> 17:34.600
- It's just temporary. 
- 'Til the sewing machine comes.

17:34.722 --> 17:38.082
Oh, hey... you know how many kids in India would love to come home

17:38.196 --> 17:40.335
to a room full of quiche? Sorry - tarts.

17:40.594 --> 17:43.626
- Tarts are totally different. 
- I know, honey. I know.

17:46.647 --> 17:48.141
Have a seat, Kirk. I'll be right there.

17:48.474 --> 17:49.167
Caesar.

17:50.680 --> 17:53.293
You know what the key to a truly successful tuna melt is?

17:53.463 --> 17:54.235
- What? 
- Tuna.

17:54.498 --> 17:56.026
- That's not tuna? 
- No, it's turkey.

17:56.129 --> 17:57.363
Give me the plate. I'll do it again.

17:58.007 --> 18:00.788
Don't get exasperated with me. I'm not the one that made the wrong sandwich.

18:13.167 --> 18:14.346
What are you doing, Kirk?

18:15.299 --> 18:17.654
Say I was Tom Cruise. Where would you seat me?

18:18.022 --> 18:19.001
In an acting class.

18:19.349 --> 18:21.878
No, I mean, which do you consider the best seat in the house?

18:22.042 --> 18:23.552
- I don't know. 
- How are the acoustics here?

18:23.634 --> 18:25.215
- What? 
- The bathrooms are right over there.

18:25.282 --> 18:27.730
One good loud flush and the entire mood is spoiled.

18:27.904 --> 18:30.787
I don't have time to kill you right now, Kirk. Come back in a couple of hours.

18:30.916 --> 18:33.234
All right, I'll just reserve these three tables and decide later.

18:33.368 --> 18:36.296
- Reserve these three... 
- For Wednesday night, eight o'clock.

18:36.404 --> 18:39.059
- We don't take reservations, Kirk. 
- But this is a special occasion.

18:39.296 --> 18:42.619
And Lorelai told me to go somewhere I'm comfortable, and I'm comfortable here.

18:42.773 --> 18:43.362
You are?

18:44.627 --> 18:48.021
Well, not at this moment, but previously I have been comfortable here.

18:48.487 --> 18:49.608
- Please? 
- What's the occasion?

18:50.587 --> 18:52.137
I have a date with a young lady.

18:52.286 --> 18:54.744
You really felt the need to add the "with a young lady" part?

18:55.010 --> 18:55.783
Kinda.

18:56.775 --> 18:58.773
Okay, you can have one table for eight o'clock.

18:59.055 --> 19:00.610
- Thank you. Here. 
- What's this?

19:00.846 --> 19:03.187
It's a diagram of how I would like the table set up.

19:03.493 --> 19:08.255
See - little flowers by her plate, and the champagne bucket over here

19:08.317 --> 19:10.640
so I don't accidentally knock it off the table with my elbow.

19:10.759 --> 19:12.629
- I don't sell champagne, Kirk. 
- Why not?

19:12.724 --> 19:14.830
- Because this is a diner. 
- Good champagne goes with everything.

19:14.932 --> 19:17.098
- Get your own champagne, Kirk. 
- But what about the flowers?

19:17.206 --> 19:18.520
- Kirk. 
- Okay, fine.

19:18.629 --> 19:20.241
I'll get the champagne and the flowers.

19:20.359 --> 19:24.327
Now, let's say the date goes well. How much for the place upstairs?

19:25.081 --> 19:27.014
- You mean my apartment? 
- Yes.

19:27.164 --> 19:29.002
- Bye, Kirk. 
- Okay, see you later.

19:31.142 --> 19:33.077
- Excuse me, is that good? 
- Yes.

19:33.231 --> 19:34.024
And what is that?

19:34.747 --> 19:35.560
Meat loaf.

19:35.786 --> 19:39.702
Okay, so, this meat loaf, is it a romantic food for you? I mean, is it getting you hot?

19:39.768 --> 19:40.434
Kirk!

19:40.896 --> 19:41.730
Good talking to you.

19:49.357 --> 19:51.289
I can't believe we're doing this.

19:51.663 --> 19:54.326
Well, you did tell her to treat us like any other catering service.

19:54.453 --> 19:57.663
"I'd like you to do a test meal, Lorelai. After all, you are a new company."

19:57.833 --> 19:59.758
She must be so happy right now.

19:59.901 --> 20:02.937
She's probably been cackling into her magic mirror all morning.

20:03.065 --> 20:04.874
It's going to be a breeze. You wait and see.

20:05.302 --> 20:07.310
Three hours of bowing and scraping.

20:07.525 --> 20:10.465
We are not going to be bowing and scraping. We're going to be serving and delighting.

20:10.577 --> 20:12.394
Anything to humiliate me, anything at all.

20:13.060 --> 20:14.765
Wow! You grew up here?

20:15.170 --> 20:18.580
- I swear, if she makes me wear a uniform... 
- This is Citizen Kane's house.

20:18.676 --> 20:21.635
- Drape one of those napkins over my arm. 
- Is there a moat?

20:22.091 --> 20:25.132
Just help me out here, okay? Run interference whenever you can.

20:25.334 --> 20:26.136
I promise.

20:27.457 --> 20:30.985
- May I help you? 
- Hi. We're the caterers. We're here for...

20:31.067 --> 20:32.419
The servants' entrance is around back.

20:34.697 --> 20:35.839
Was that a maid?

20:36.366 --> 20:36.950
Come on.

20:39.664 --> 20:41.257
What are all those tennis balls doing over here?

20:47.574 --> 20:51.756
Irish studies suck, German studies suck, everything here sucks, sucks, sucks!

20:53.668 --> 20:55.403
That yoga's really working for you, Glenn.

21:05.070 --> 21:07.179
Don't get that, I mean it! Do not touch that phone!

21:57.500 --> 22:01.130
Oh, great, I'm glad you got that. It's been bugging me for the last...

22:02.368 --> 22:05.031
- Is this the off-white or the cream? 
- The off-white.

22:05.808 --> 22:07.303
The cream is more creamy.

22:09.377 --> 22:11.377
I cut those myself so they could be adjusted either way.

22:11.472 --> 22:12.854
I mean, they could be adjusted smaller.

22:13.473 --> 22:15.685
Taller would be tougher once they're cut, but,

22:16.116 --> 22:18.173
if they tell a lie, they'll shoot right back up.

22:18.430 --> 22:20.345
- I assume you'll have servers. 
- Yes, we will.

22:20.518 --> 22:23.453
I assume you'll instruct your servers to omit the Pinocchio humor.

22:23.570 --> 22:24.302
Yes, we will.

22:24.522 --> 22:26.193
Okay, here we go.

22:27.672 --> 22:30.150
Now, we would start off with either the roasted asparagus

22:30.227 --> 22:32.034
with the Parmesan or the trio of winter soups -

22:32.228 --> 22:35.065
tomato basil, butternut squash, and Catalonian garlic.

22:35.434 --> 22:38.039
- Very ambitious. 
- And very tasty.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.374
I'll tell the servers not to do that either.

22:49.360 --> 22:50.420
- Lorelai? 
- Yes?

22:50.967 --> 22:53.450
- My napkin. 
- Oh, well, yes.

22:54.076 --> 22:55.437
Napkin, yes, your napkin. I got it.

22:55.571 --> 22:57.996
- Do you want me to just tuck it in your shirt there or... 
- My lap will be fine.

22:58.154 --> 23:01.371
Okay. There you go.

23:01.525 --> 23:04.638
Feel free to spill anything you want down there. You are covered.

23:31.542 --> 23:33.526
- What is the next course? 
- Lobster potpie.

23:33.649 --> 23:35.537
- You may bring it out now. 
- Okay.

23:35.835 --> 23:38.379
- Sookie, how far along are you? 
- Eight months.

23:38.676 --> 23:42.455
Lorelai, there doesn't seem to be any reason for a pregnant woman in her eighth month

23:42.527 --> 23:44.369
to be running back and forth to the kitchen, does there?

23:44.441 --> 23:45.804
No, there doesn't.

23:46.351 --> 23:48.982
You should take my plate. Otherwise, you'll have no place to put the potpie.

23:49.308 --> 23:50.775
Oh, I can think of a place.

23:51.281 --> 23:52.766
- What was that? 
- Plates going bye-bye.

23:57.034 --> 23:59.709
Okay, when I give the signal,

23:59.827 --> 24:02.463
you run in and distract her and I'll take her down. Got it?

24:05.715 --> 24:08.711
Here we go - Sookie's famous lobster potpie.

24:13.734 --> 24:15.514
- Very nice crust. 
- Thank you.

24:22.536 --> 24:26.576
Well, Sookie, I must say your food is as accomplished as I remember it.

24:26.816 --> 24:27.824
Oh, thank you, Emily.

24:28.087 --> 24:30.625
And I think after we fine-tune the presentation,

24:30.733 --> 24:33.087
we'll have ourselves a very nice dinner party.

24:33.374 --> 24:36.154
- So we got the job? 
- Yes, you got the job.

24:37.199 --> 24:40.584
We got the job. Thank you. You will not be disappointed.

24:40.712 --> 24:44.130
No, I will not. The event starts at 7:30,

24:44.218 --> 24:45.816
I would like you to be here at four o'clock.

24:46.190 --> 24:48.340
I'm going to make a Xerox copy of my notes here

24:48.407 --> 24:50.281
so the two of you can peruse it on the way home.

24:52.704 --> 24:57.254
We did it, we got the job! What a score! We landed a whale.

24:57.372 --> 25:00.782
Yeah, we always had the job, Sookie. The whale was just toying with us.

25:00.864 --> 25:03.859
She was swatting us with her tail and hosing us down with her blowhole

25:03.976 --> 25:08.437
because that is the whale's M.O. - humiliate and rip apart every other fish in the sea

25:08.533 --> 25:11.662
until there's nothing left but a bloody pile of chum.

25:12.261 --> 25:14.135
Boy, you really hate whales, don't you?

25:17.713 --> 25:20.965
It's amazing. Out of the blue, bam! It was right there.

25:21.092 --> 25:23.162
Well, things always happen when you least expect it.

25:23.254 --> 25:26.725
- I have to tell you, this tree is perfect. 
- All girls think their tree is perfect.

25:26.966 --> 25:29.617
It fits my back completely, and there's plenty of grass,

25:29.690 --> 25:32.209
and it's in a great area - just far enough away from anything major

25:32.300 --> 25:34.666
so there's not a lot of noise but still not in Siberia.

25:34.769 --> 25:38.192
Hey, can it cook? 'Cause I can get it a great gig with a crazy woman.

25:38.306 --> 25:41.994
- Grandma's not crazy. She's specific. 
- Well, at least one of us is happy.

25:42.141 --> 25:44.471
- And thank God it's me. 
- My feelings exactly.

25:44.593 --> 25:47.441
You have no idea how much studying I got done today.

25:47.605 --> 25:50.185
- Seriously, ask me anything. 
- Okay.

25:50.374 --> 25:53.488
How'd I get shanghaied into catering a party for my mother?

25:53.585 --> 25:54.865
You keep repeating yourself.

25:54.987 --> 25:59.063
Well, as soon as I hear you talking about a study shrub, I'll know it's time to move on.

25:59.166 --> 26:00.282
Okay, fine, I have to go.

26:00.420 --> 26:02.964
Yeah? Gonna go shopping for a nice yellow ribbon?

26:03.068 --> 26:04.983
- Have some chili fries for me. 
- I will.

26:07.066 --> 26:09.033
Cheeseburger, onion rings, and a list of people

26:09.084 --> 26:11.632
who killed their parents and got away with it. I'm looking for heroes.

26:11.714 --> 26:13.558
- How'd the tasting go? 
- We got the job.

26:13.702 --> 26:15.791
- Would have been pathetic if you hadn't. 
- I can't do this.

26:15.914 --> 26:18.033
- It's a gig. 
- Yes, it is a gig.

26:18.156 --> 26:21.582
It's Prince opening for the Rolling Stones. That's the kind of gig it is.

26:24.167 --> 26:25.006
- Luke... 
- Yeah?

26:25.211 --> 26:26.732
- What's Kirk doing? 
- Practicing.

26:28.233 --> 26:29.338
- For what? 
- His date.

26:29.420 --> 26:32.461
He's doing a test run - talking, eating, making conversation.

26:32.533 --> 26:35.411
Then he's gonna go home and review the tape and adjust from there.

26:35.589 --> 26:38.854
Boy! You ever think about how many different ways

26:38.995 --> 26:41.760
- Kirk could get kicked out of the Army? 
- What a poor slob.

26:41.933 --> 26:44.084
- He's pathetic. 
- He likes a girl. That's sweet.

26:44.176 --> 26:47.703
All day long, I have this crazy person sitting in my diner ordering everything off the menu,

26:47.782 --> 26:51.815
by the way, to see which meal has less crumb-to-sweater ratio.

26:51.938 --> 26:54.646
Well, if he's bugging you that much, you can ask him to leave.

26:54.708 --> 26:56.449
You ask him to leave. It's your fault he's here.

26:56.526 --> 26:58.102
How is it my fault? I'm not going out with him.

26:58.163 --> 27:00.268
You're the one that told him to find someplace he felt comfortable.

27:00.350 --> 27:01.836
How did I know he felt comfortable here?

27:01.912 --> 27:03.741
I don't know. All I know is that you talked to him,

27:03.821 --> 27:05.965
and now he's over there talking to a camera.

27:06.085 --> 27:07.589
Oh, come on, Luke. Give him a break.

27:07.841 --> 27:09.467
He wants the date to go well.

27:10.437 --> 27:12.695
I mean, it's all any of us wants -

27:12.955 --> 27:17.532
to find a nice person to hang out with 'til we drop dead. Not a lot to ask.

27:17.687 --> 27:18.378
I guess.

27:18.527 --> 27:22.069
And look on the positive side - if Kirk's date goes well, he'll be occupied,

27:22.116 --> 27:23.851
and you'll be seeing a lot less of him at the diner.

27:23.985 --> 27:26.734
Cut! Okay, that sucked!

27:26.913 --> 27:29.947
Let's just go again right away.

27:30.298 --> 27:32.883
Focus! Focus.

27:33.702 --> 27:36.365
I'll have his monogrammed booth installed tomorrow.

27:40.778 --> 27:42.792
All right, I think this should be everyone.

27:43.227 --> 27:44.138
You've double-checked it?

27:44.307 --> 27:46.728
I have double-checked it, but I'm sure you will also double-check it.

27:46.877 --> 27:47.728
You know I will.

27:47.866 --> 27:50.174
So I am entirely confident that no one will be left out.

27:51.337 --> 27:53.169
- This is very nice. 
- Isn't it, though?

27:53.262 --> 27:55.509
It's a florist Lorelai found. We're using him for the party.

27:55.670 --> 27:57.296
Oh, I think that will be perfect.

27:57.405 --> 28:00.020
It has to be perfect. These are important people we're trying to impress.

28:00.317 --> 28:03.267
- Richard, Emily. 
- Jason, what a pleasant surprise.

28:03.481 --> 28:05.663
Richard, you should have told me Jason was coming over.

28:05.755 --> 28:07.024
I would have had something prepared.

28:07.143 --> 28:10.118
Oh, please, Emily, I've gained ten pounds since I came into this house.

28:10.245 --> 28:12.227
Men always say that and it's never true.

28:12.395 --> 28:14.004
I just dropped by for the keys to the office.

28:14.117 --> 28:15.873
Ah, that's right. Forgot to give you the keys.

28:16.452 --> 28:18.826
Oh, my apologies, Jason. Here you go.

28:19.430 --> 28:22.006
Thank you. Sorry to interrupt your evening. I'll see you tomorrow.

28:22.519 --> 28:25.600
Oh, Jason, I'm going to need your guest list as soon as possible.

28:25.759 --> 28:27.438
- My guest list? 
- To the launch party.

28:27.818 --> 28:31.068
Oh, Richard, you did remember to ask Jason for his list, didn't you?

28:31.170 --> 28:32.758
Emily, I am a very busy man.

28:32.902 --> 28:35.600
Oh, honestly, Richard, that's what you have a secretary for.

28:36.168 --> 28:38.103
Jason, I apologize for my husband.

28:38.318 --> 28:40.924
The official launch party for your company is next week.

28:41.110 --> 28:44.043
I've got the entire thing organized. All I need is your guest list.

28:44.175 --> 28:45.451
You organized a launch party.

28:45.568 --> 28:47.565
Yes, and trust me when I tell you that there is no one

28:47.627 --> 28:51.687
who can throw together a more elegant event at the drop of a hat than Emily Gilmore.

28:51.938 --> 28:54.109
True, and thank you, and you still forgot to tell him.

28:54.199 --> 28:55.803
Well, Emily, I really appreciate the thought,

28:55.871 --> 28:58.138
but I'm not so sure a launch party is the way to go.

28:58.312 --> 28:59.090
What do you mean?

28:59.264 --> 29:02.127
Jason, it's traditional to do something for our clients. They appreciate it.

29:02.336 --> 29:05.634
It gives us a chance to talk to them one-on-one, develop relationships.

29:05.772 --> 29:08.650
It's the extra little things that set you apart in business, Jason.

29:08.758 --> 29:10.534
I couldn't agree more, and that is why

29:10.646 --> 29:13.873
- I've organized a trip to Atlantic City. 
- What?

29:13.974 --> 29:17.287
You know, get everybody out, away from business, away from their spouses,

29:17.348 --> 29:20.473
away from stuffy cocktail-party music and floral arrangements.

29:20.671 --> 29:24.404
Have a little crazy fun - you know, good food, lots to drink,

29:24.491 --> 29:26.201
maybe a little gambling, a show, and trust me,

29:26.277 --> 29:28.474
nothing bonds two businessmen together more than one of them

29:28.531 --> 29:30.978
finding the other hung over with a hooker in their bed the next morning.

29:31.076 --> 29:32.632
- What? 
- Just a figure of speech, Emily.

29:32.728 --> 29:36.063
You cannot be serious. These are dignified men and women.

29:36.278 --> 29:38.760
- There are mobsters in Atlantic City. 
- Let's hope so.

29:38.976 --> 29:41.468
- Talk to him. 
- Well, Jason, I'm not so sure this...

29:41.551 --> 29:43.914
Richard, this is the kind of thing that could set us apart from the other companies.

29:43.998 --> 29:45.502
It's different, maybe a little crazy,

29:45.565 --> 29:48.955
but they will remember it and they will tell their friends about it.

29:49.041 --> 29:50.793
Yes, I suppose they will.

29:50.901 --> 29:53.895
Every other company in town is throwing a dignified cocktail party.

29:54.034 --> 29:59.292
Believe me, right now my mother has twelve caterers throttling every sturgeon they can find

29:59.338 --> 30:01.253
to get fine caviar for my father's clients.

30:01.334 --> 30:04.345
Let's not give our clients canapés, Richard.

30:04.508 --> 30:07.069
- Let's give 'em some fun. 
- Well, it is different.

30:07.234 --> 30:10.157
- You can't be serious. 
- Well, it's good to change with the times.

30:10.251 --> 30:12.967
You're running an insurance company, not a rap label.

30:13.300 --> 30:15.312
People aren't looking to you to give them a good time.

30:15.410 --> 30:17.462
They are looking to you to protect their livelihood.

30:17.576 --> 30:19.102
Now let's think about this for a moment.

30:19.459 --> 30:23.766
I mean, how far along is this party? Is it too late to cancel?

30:24.431 --> 30:25.998
No, it's not too late to cancel.

30:26.376 --> 30:27.028
All right.

30:27.881 --> 30:30.494
Jason, we'll try it your way. Atlantic City it is.

30:30.626 --> 30:33.544
I think it's a good move, Richard. And Emily, thank you again for the offer.

30:33.626 --> 30:37.113
- But see, now you can just hang out and relax. 
- My two favorite things.

30:37.969 --> 30:39.600
- All right, see you tomorrow. 
- See you tomorrow.

30:58.960 --> 31:01.387
Excuse me, you're sitting under my tree.

31:01.736 --> 31:04.240
- What? 
- My study tree, this is my study tree.

31:04.706 --> 31:05.765
What the hell's a study tree?

31:05.980 --> 31:08.047
- Okay. See, I have roommates... 
- So do I.

31:08.408 --> 31:10.865
Yes, but I have Paris and I have Tanna

31:10.983 --> 31:12.939
and I have Janet, and Janet squeaks...

31:13.020 --> 31:13.937
Look, I'm busy, okay?

31:14.204 --> 31:17.899
Yes, I see you're very busy with your "Trucker's Monthly" there,

31:18.039 --> 31:21.002
but I finally found a great place to study, and you're sitting on it.

31:21.141 --> 31:22.564
There's a million trees on campus.

31:22.702 --> 31:25.734
But this one fits my back perfectly so I don't get tired, and the light is right,

31:25.821 --> 31:29.087
and it's just far enough away from anything busy so that the noise level is perfect,

31:29.178 --> 31:31.734
and it's quiet but not Unabomber, and...

31:32.861 --> 31:35.696
and anyhow, I was just hoping that maybe

31:35.799 --> 31:38.379
you would consider giving me back my tree.

31:38.539 --> 31:39.189
No.

31:43.026 --> 31:44.278
Well...

31:58.312 --> 31:58.989
After you.

32:00.092 --> 32:01.522
Wow, this place seems nice.

32:01.875 --> 32:04.256
Yes, diners are apparently all the rage nowadays.

32:04.836 --> 32:05.435
Really?

32:05.966 --> 32:07.616
Very hip. Very, very hip.

32:08.036 --> 32:09.727
- Excuse me. 
- Yes?

32:09.961 --> 32:12.399
I believe I have reservations for two. The name's Kirk.

32:12.664 --> 32:14.981
Kirk, yes. Okay. Follow me.

32:17.543 --> 32:20.185
- How's this? 
- Very satisfactory. Thank you.

32:20.754 --> 32:23.257
- There's more where that came from. 
- It's my lucky night.

32:24.922 --> 32:28.660
- Wow, I'm getting the fancy treatment. 
- Well, you did show up.

32:29.444 --> 32:30.302
Yes, I did.

32:32.157 --> 32:33.780
I hear the meat loaf is excellent here.

32:38.438 --> 32:40.241
Coming, coming, coming.

32:44.352 --> 32:44.859
Mom.

32:45.581 --> 32:47.363
- Were you asleep? 
- No.

32:47.972 --> 32:50.102
- Then why are you in your pajamas? 
- These aren't pajamas.

32:50.189 --> 32:51.074
You wear that in public?

32:51.755 --> 32:53.108
Hi, Mom. Would you like to come in?

32:57.859 --> 32:59.712
You have the word "juicy" on your rear end.

32:59.840 --> 33:02.512
Well, if I had known you were coming over, I would have changed.

33:03.010 --> 33:04.930
Into what, a brassiere with the word "tasty" on it?

33:05.273 --> 33:06.855
Hey, Mom, what can I do for you?

33:07.632 --> 33:10.218
- I have to talk to you about something. 
- Is everything okay?

33:11.565 --> 33:14.494
I'm afraid you aren't going to be catering the launch party after all.

33:14.877 --> 33:15.907
What? Why?

33:16.440 --> 33:19.015
Your father and I just decided to go a different way, that's all.

33:19.148 --> 33:20.254
A different way?

33:20.458 --> 33:22.696
Now, of course, I realize you've already put out some money.

33:22.830 --> 33:23.885
Yeah, we have.

33:24.022 --> 33:26.992
Of course, I will reimburse you for all expenses. Just give me the receipts.

33:27.494 --> 33:28.119
Great.

33:28.850 --> 33:31.059
That's it. That's all I came to tell you.

33:31.308 --> 33:33.197
Okay, well, thanks for the notice.

33:33.592 --> 33:35.394
You don't have to take that tone with me, Lorelai.

33:35.481 --> 33:38.763
Really, I don't? After you made us do that ridiculous tasting at the house?

33:38.885 --> 33:40.673
You told me to treat you like any other company.

33:40.801 --> 33:44.139
Oh, but you sat there like the Queen of England, making us jump through hoops

33:44.206 --> 33:47.590
and taking ridiculous notes and for what - so you could fire us?

33:47.672 --> 33:49.996
Is this payback for me not telling you about the business?

33:50.068 --> 33:53.765
Because, I have to say, Mom, even for you, it seems a little extreme.

33:53.857 --> 33:56.040
- I understand you're upset. 
- Yes, I'm upset!

33:56.156 --> 33:59.730
We needed that money, Mom. And I knew that humiliation was part of the package,

33:59.847 --> 34:01.983
but I did it because I had to,

34:02.111 --> 34:05.141
and - just you abruptly firing us is completely wrong!

34:05.417 --> 34:06.529
I agree, it is wrong.

34:07.661 --> 34:09.426
Well, okay, then...

34:10.681 --> 34:13.703
as long as you agree it's wrong... what? Okay.

34:14.020 --> 34:16.420
I'm sorry, Lorelai. I really am.

34:17.281 --> 34:18.992
I thought your table was lovely.

34:19.405 --> 34:21.039
I thought the food was wonderful.

34:21.591 --> 34:23.532
I was really looking forward to this party.

34:24.260 --> 34:26.415
I think it might have been the best one I ever put on.

34:27.172 --> 34:28.407
So, then, what happened?

34:28.915 --> 34:31.130
Oh, you know, times change, Lorelai.

34:31.833 --> 34:34.130
Things that were once considered proper and elegant

34:34.217 --> 34:36.083
are now considered stuffy and out-of-date.

34:36.342 --> 34:37.146
Like what?

34:37.643 --> 34:41.033
Like canapés and cocktail parties and the people who plan them.

34:41.356 --> 34:44.268
- Mom, what are you talking about? 
- Nothing. It's not important.

34:44.474 --> 34:45.338
Mom, come on.

34:47.638 --> 34:51.114
Jason decided to take the clients to Atlantic City instead.

34:51.452 --> 34:53.321
He thinks that's what they would prefer to do.

34:53.659 --> 34:55.329
He's probably right anyhow. What do I know?

34:55.433 --> 34:57.161
Did he know all the work you put into this?

34:57.252 --> 34:58.574
It's really not important, Lorelai.

34:58.855 --> 35:00.622
I do this for your father.

35:00.909 --> 35:03.965
I have done this for your father for the last 36 years.

35:04.354 --> 35:06.736
If he thinks that Jason's right, then it's fine with me.

35:07.590 --> 35:09.987
And after all, now I don't have to worry about a party.

35:10.734 --> 35:12.470
I can just relax and hang out.

35:13.331 --> 35:13.836
Mom.

35:14.441 --> 35:15.373
Anyhow, I have to go.

35:15.890 --> 35:19.653
I'm wasting all my hanging-out time sitting here talking about this silly party.

35:20.442 --> 35:22.403
Send me those receipts and I'll get you a check.

35:23.104 --> 35:25.009
Okay, well, great.

35:25.531 --> 35:27.844
- Apologize to Sookie for me, will you? 
- Sure.

35:28.158 --> 35:29.426
We'll see you girls Friday night.

35:39.663 --> 35:41.634
Oh, my gosh, that's so funny.

35:44.619 --> 35:46.416
That's amazing, you sound just like him.

35:54.931 --> 35:57.393
- Luke. 
- Jeez! Kirk, what are you doing?

35:57.644 --> 35:59.747
- I need your help. 
- I'm filling the coffee here.

35:59.846 --> 36:01.864
- Look behind me. 
- What am I looking at, Kirk?

36:02.063 --> 36:04.131
- Is she still there? 
- Who?

36:04.398 --> 36:06.661
- Lulu. Is Lulu still there? 
- You mean your date?

36:06.743 --> 36:08.555
Yes, Lulu, my date. Who else would I mean?

36:08.626 --> 36:11.279
- Catch up, man. Time is of the essence. 
- Yes, she's still there.

36:11.478 --> 36:14.059
- Are you sure? 
- Yes, I'm sure, now get out from behind my counter.

36:14.228 --> 36:15.845
I don't know what to do.

36:16.446 --> 36:19.445
What are you talking about? I just looked over there and everything seemed fine.

36:19.564 --> 36:21.380
- Exactly. Everything seemed fine. 
- So?

36:21.529 --> 36:23.014
- Doesn't that seem weird to you? 
- No.

36:23.424 --> 36:25.216
- Really? 
- Yes, a little, but so what?

36:25.324 --> 36:29.245
- Why question it? Go back over there. 
- I can't. I don't understand what's happening.

36:29.318 --> 36:31.580
I mean, she was looking at me. Directly at me.

36:31.671 --> 36:34.852
At first I thought I had something on my lip, but I brushed and brushed and nothing.

36:34.917 --> 36:37.514
- She was just looking at me. 
- Well, that's good.

36:37.622 --> 36:40.024
And I have prepared several small-talk subjects for the evening

36:40.099 --> 36:42.317
- and I haven't used one of them. 
- You're making too much of this.

36:42.400 --> 36:45.195
This is not how it's supposed to go. I'm supposed to take her out,

36:45.313 --> 36:47.755
we're supposed to exhaust my prepared subjects immediately,

36:47.881 --> 36:49.414
and then the minute I get up and go to the bathroom,

36:49.578 --> 36:52.306
she is supposed to sneak out and leave me here humiliated.

36:52.399 --> 36:54.954
Now I have been to the bathroom three times, and I have to tell you,

36:54.999 --> 36:57.396
I did not have to go, and every time I came back to the table,

36:57.472 --> 36:59.562
she was there and she was smiling, and...

36:59.691 --> 37:02.531
hey, did you see her touch my arm? What the hell was that all about?

37:02.633 --> 37:05.722
- I think that means she likes you. 
- Shut up! You take that back!

37:05.870 --> 37:09.653
Kirk, Kirk, I am not gonna fight with you over you not believing that this girl likes you

37:09.720 --> 37:12.848
because, to be honest with you, I'm a little fuzzy on the "why" myself,

37:12.935 --> 37:16.023
- but the bottom line is she does. 
- She does?

37:16.186 --> 37:19.360
Yes, she's laughing and smiling, and buckle up, cowboy,

37:19.427 --> 37:21.371
because I think she might actually touch you again.

37:21.465 --> 37:22.039
You think?

37:22.182 --> 37:25.100
There's a frightening chance she might, so my advice to you

37:25.193 --> 37:28.556
is to go back over there and continue doing what you've been doing.

37:28.659 --> 37:30.989
I was doing my Jon Cryer from "Pretty in Pink" impression.

37:31.060 --> 37:32.130
- Duckie? 
- Yes, Duckie.

37:32.290 --> 37:33.498
Were you near the end of the movie yet?

37:33.575 --> 37:35.483
No, just getting to the "Try a Little Tenderness" moment.

37:35.591 --> 37:38.577
You've got plenty of ammo left. Go on. Go back over there.

37:39.097 --> 37:41.535
- You think she likes me? 
- I think she likes you.

37:42.175 --> 37:43.046
You think she likes me.

37:47.373 --> 37:48.530
God help us one and all.

37:49.831 --> 37:52.104
No, just leave another message that I called.

37:52.928 --> 37:53.537
Thank you.

37:54.193 --> 37:56.128
Number 42, see ya.

37:57.192 --> 37:58.704
You don't have to throw them all out, Sookie.

37:58.801 --> 38:00.883
- I didn't. I've got twenty in the freezer. 
- Great.

38:00.987 --> 38:02.378
- And so do you. 
- Even better.

38:02.529 --> 38:04.130
I already had that money spent.

38:04.259 --> 38:07.243
It was going towards a down payment on a safer car.

38:07.510 --> 38:10.987
Now little Davey will have to fend for himself rolling around in the back of Daddy's truck.

38:11.212 --> 38:12.410
- Mom? 
- Kitchen.

38:12.579 --> 38:14.996
"Hold on, Davey! Daddy's coming to a sudden stop."

38:15.087 --> 38:17.083
- You're being dramatic. 
- But I'm so disappointed.

38:17.366 --> 38:20.632
I mean, all that planning, all that time, all that broccoli.

38:20.730 --> 38:22.147
- I lost my tree. 
- What?

38:22.327 --> 38:25.227
My tree, my study tree - it's gone. Someone stole it.

38:25.496 --> 38:27.862
- Someone stole a tree? 
- No, the tree's still there,

38:27.933 --> 38:30.826
but when I went there today, there was this guy sitting there reading trucking magazines

38:30.883 --> 38:32.987
and he would not give it up, so now I'm back where I started.

38:33.074 --> 38:34.022
You'll figure something out.

38:34.138 --> 38:36.714
Yes, I will figure out what my alternate profession will be

38:36.797 --> 38:39.376
because now I can't study, I'm gonna flunk out of Yale

38:39.459 --> 38:41.943
and I'm gonna have to give up all hope of being a foreign correspondent.

38:42.112 --> 38:43.682
- This sucks. 
- You're telling me?

38:43.764 --> 38:46.956
- I'm eating broccoli tarts for the next four years. 
- Well, what am I gonna do?

38:47.113 --> 38:48.900
- You are gonna suck it up. 
- What?

38:48.992 --> 38:51.363
You're in college now, Rory. If your study plan doesn't work,

38:51.460 --> 38:53.867
then come up with another one. Just figure it out,

38:54.016 --> 38:55.832
but stop complaining because you're not two.

38:55.904 --> 38:58.433
And Sookie, in pioneer times, kids traveled across the country

38:58.521 --> 39:00.262
in covered wagons and survived.

39:00.385 --> 39:02.823
Somehow I think little Davey will live without his minivan.

39:03.251 --> 39:05.649
- Mom, why are you mad? 
- I have something I have to do.

39:05.724 --> 39:09.325
I'll be back in a little while. And have these damn tarts out of here by the time I get home!

39:12.206 --> 39:12.958
Grab a fork.

39:15.375 --> 39:18.033
Well, hello, Digger Stiles.

39:18.161 --> 39:20.414
Lorelai Gilmore, you sure grew up good.

39:20.537 --> 39:23.527
Oh, did I, Digger? Thanks. Listen, why didn't you return my calls?

39:23.670 --> 39:26.665
- 'Cause I hadn't seen you yet. 
- Four times. You never called me back.

39:26.752 --> 39:29.149
- I'll call you back now. What's your number? 
- 976-bite-me.

39:29.261 --> 39:30.505
Okay, did you get that, Ms. Lomay?

39:30.572 --> 39:32.431
Because I know how much you like having numbers in your files.

39:32.512 --> 39:33.650
- We need to talk. 
- In my office?

39:33.796 --> 39:34.479
Great.

39:34.822 --> 39:36.675
- You know what? You can go. 
- All right.

39:37.367 --> 39:38.518
- Goodnight, Mr. Stiles. 
- Goodnight.

39:39.097 --> 39:40.905
- Would you like something to drink? 
- Oh, no, thanks.

39:41.012 --> 39:42.272
- So how you been? 
- Great. You?

39:42.363 --> 39:43.982
- No complaints. 
- Okay, small talk over.

39:44.288 --> 39:48.595
I want you to know something - you can't just waltz into people's lives and take over.

39:48.657 --> 39:50.796
I don't waltz at all. It's embarrassing and a little gay.

39:50.909 --> 39:53.811
You know, people were hired for this party, people who were counting on this money.

39:53.941 --> 39:55.343
- What party? 
- Launch party.

39:55.511 --> 39:57.007
- Oh, that. 
- Yes, that.

39:57.094 --> 39:59.638
And I want to tell you something else - my mother has been planning

39:59.725 --> 40:03.654
these stupid parties for years, and it was completely out of line for you

40:03.729 --> 40:07.201
to walk in there and just crap all over the whole thing

40:07.289 --> 40:09.429
and make her feel obsolete and useless.

40:09.951 --> 40:13.089
Hold on there. I never knew about the party. They never told me about the party.

40:13.186 --> 40:14.932
Of course they never told you about the party

40:15.025 --> 40:16.607
because they're inconsiderate and self-centered,

40:16.741 --> 40:19.238
and they have been that way for many years, so they have dibs.

40:19.372 --> 40:22.069
But the minute you found out about the party, you should have canceled your plans.

40:22.158 --> 40:24.952
It was too late for that. And I never called your mother obsolete,

40:25.044 --> 40:27.159
- I just called cocktail parties obsolete. 
- Same thing.

40:27.264 --> 40:31.409
- I don't see how. 
- Jason, my mother is a corporate wife.

40:31.589 --> 40:35.842
Her job is putting these parties on, and you put her out of work.

40:35.955 --> 40:37.834
You know that, your mother does the same thing.

40:38.029 --> 40:41.562
Imagine if you took these functions away from her. What would she have left?

40:41.663 --> 40:42.626
More time with the pool boy?

40:42.714 --> 40:45.663
You embarrassed my mother and made her feel small.

40:45.806 --> 40:49.150
You unceremoniously canceled something she had been working on for days.

40:49.237 --> 40:50.388
But I didn't know.

40:50.486 --> 40:52.339
And then she had to come to my house and fire me!

40:52.453 --> 40:55.704
- Fire you? Why would she fire you? 
- Because I was the caterer.

40:55.775 --> 40:57.035
Get out of town!

40:57.164 --> 40:59.411
Yes, I have a partner in a small catering company.

40:59.528 --> 41:01.133
- You cook? 
- I plan.

41:01.279 --> 41:04.422
I had no idea how much chaos my little weekend was causing.

41:04.513 --> 41:06.793
No, you didn't, because you didn't think. You never thought.

41:06.885 --> 41:09.994
Back in summer camp, you never thought. "Hey, if I stand up in this canoe,

41:10.136 --> 41:13.076
maybe it'll tip over." That was the extent of your thought process.

41:13.167 --> 41:15.707
- You're still mad about that. 
- I was fully dressed.

41:15.815 --> 41:18.155
- I remember, green T-shirt, no bra. 
- What?

41:18.293 --> 41:21.120
Trust me, I was the hero of cabin five for the rest of the summer.

41:21.400 --> 41:23.331
- You will apologize to my mother. 
- Absolutely.

41:23.429 --> 41:25.495
- And you will let her throw that party. 
- Sorry.

41:25.645 --> 41:26.884
- Digger! 
- Umlauts!

41:26.996 --> 41:29.286
The party is off. Now this is business. I will apologize to Emily,

41:29.383 --> 41:32.921
- but that is the best I can do. 
- I can't believe you just called me Umlauts.

41:33.023 --> 41:35.465
You called me Digger three times before I called you Umlauts once.

41:35.542 --> 41:37.887
- I think that shows great self-control. 
- Let my mother have her party!

41:38.036 --> 41:40.862
No, I can't do it, but what I can do is take you out to dinner tomorrow night.

41:40.975 --> 41:44.180
I'm sorry, how do those two thoughts even coincide?

41:44.262 --> 41:46.479
You'd have to be in my head, but trust me, there was a track.

41:46.638 --> 41:48.779
- I am not having dinner with you. 
- Why not?

41:48.977 --> 41:53.150
Because you just had me fired. You just insulted my mother.

41:53.257 --> 41:54.993
It's interesting, I didn't know you and your mother were so close.

41:55.091 --> 41:56.982
- We're not. 
- You're being awfully protective of her.

41:57.067 --> 41:58.439
Well, every family has a Fredo.

41:58.520 --> 42:00.569
Yeah, and Fredo's family put two in the back of his head.

42:00.642 --> 42:02.228
My relationship with my mother is none of your business.

42:02.305 --> 42:03.477
- Then have dinner with me. 
- No!

42:03.590 --> 42:04.594
- Why not? 
- Because.

42:04.702 --> 42:06.918
Because your mother would hate it.

42:07.021 --> 42:08.591
Yes, my mother would hate it.

42:10.856 --> 42:11.459
A lot.

42:16.840 --> 42:17.896
You suck.

42:27.941 --> 42:28.790
Excuse me.

42:30.050 --> 42:31.371
- Remember me? 
- I got here first.

42:31.474 --> 42:34.607
I know. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm sorry about the other day.

42:34.966 --> 42:38.666
I got a little wound up because I do that sometimes.

42:38.748 --> 42:42.472
I get too structured and too serious and I just have to adjust, you know,

42:42.636 --> 42:46.219
because we're in college and college is about change,

42:46.301 --> 42:48.963
and you have my study tree, so yeah, I just...

42:49.169 --> 42:52.523
I have to be okay with that and just learn to kind of go with the flow.

42:53.301 --> 42:57.146
So I just wanted to tell you that, and I'm sorry if I interrupted you again.

42:57.448 --> 42:58.073
That's okay.

43:01.615 --> 43:03.371
I'll give you twenty bucks for the tree.

43:04.329 --> 43:06.762
- You're gonna pay me for the tree? 
- Go with the flow, man.

43:07.078 --> 43:07.549
You're on.
