It's a cosy evening, and Sarah and Duck are in the bedroom,

00:19.680 --> 00:23.640
leafing through their new art shop catalogue.

00:23.640 --> 00:26.960
I'm getting...that one!

00:26.960 --> 00:28.600
Good choice.

00:28.600 --> 00:30.240
Quack, quack, quack...

00:30.240 --> 00:32.000
QUACK!

00:32.000 --> 00:33.800
Ohh.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.520

00:45.520 --> 00:48.880
Wow. Come on, Duck - art shop.

00:48.880 --> 00:50.440
Quack.

00:52.360 --> 00:57.240
- Er, hold it. Won't the art shop be closed now?
- Oh, yeah.

00:57.240 --> 01:00.560
You'll have to wait until it's open tomorrow morning.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.880
- OK. Night.
- Night?

01:06.760 --> 01:09.120
It's a bit early for bed, isn't it?

01:09.120 --> 01:13.880
- Nope. It's so tomorrow gets here quicker.
- Oh, I see.

01:15.400 --> 01:16.960
Goodnight then.

01:23.760 --> 01:25.640
SHE GASPS Daytime!

01:25.640 --> 01:29.520
- YAWNING:
- Well, I suppose you COULD call it daytime.

01:29.520 --> 01:31.000
Duck, art shop!

Quack, quack...

01:38.720 --> 01:43.360
- It's closed.
- Well, we are rather early.

01:43.360 --> 01:45.960
But I'm sure we won't have too long to wait.

01:45.960 --> 01:48.240
- QUACK!
- Huh?

01:48.240 --> 01:51.080
- What is it, Duck?
- Quack, quack.

01:52.720 --> 01:54.920
Park sparkle.

01:54.920 --> 01:59.400
Indeed. How about a look in the park while we wait?

01:59.400 --> 02:00.920
Yes!

02:06.720 --> 02:08.120
Hello.

02:16.880 --> 02:19.600
Everything's covered in dew.

- Quack, quack, quack!
- Waah!

02:45.160 --> 02:50.880
- Oh, Duck. Shall we see if the shop's open yet?
- Oh, yes.

02:55.040 --> 02:58.200
- Still closed.
- It can't be long now.

02:58.200 --> 03:00.120
SHE SIGHS

- Oh. Is the art shop not open yet?
- Nope.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.920
Want to draw with us till it opens?

03:31.920 --> 03:35.080
- Oh, yes, please.

04:43.960 --> 04:45.280
Yes!

04:48.880 --> 04:53.960

- Well, it is a glow-in-the-dark pencil, and it's daytime now.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.520
Suppose so.

04:55.520 --> 05:00.240

Aren't you going to wait until it's dark?

05:24.280 --> 05:26.760
- Nope.
- Oh, fair enough.

05:28.200 --> 05:29.640
Mmm.
