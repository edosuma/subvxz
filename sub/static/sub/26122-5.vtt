WEBVTT

00:07.742 --> 00:10.075
CAROL: I got a .22 just
in case I see anything.

00:10.111 --> 00:11.643
CHIP: That's smart.
You might see ptarmigan.

00:11.679 --> 00:13.445
Ptarmigan are just
as good of a bait.

00:13.481 --> 00:16.782
We could use the whole thing,
the skin, the head, the guts.

00:17.151 --> 00:19.284
My daughters suggested
that they would go and
get me some rabbits or

00:19.320 --> 00:21.286
some ptarmigan for, um, bait.

00:21.322 --> 00:23.222
Any animal, whether
it's a wolf, a wolverine,

00:23.257 --> 00:25.257
a fox, a marten,
a mink, an otter,

00:25.292 --> 00:27.126
they would all go
for that gut pile.

00:27.161 --> 00:29.428
Rabbits are like an all-around
bait for everything.

00:29.463 --> 00:31.764
And rabbit guts,
now that's a bait.

00:31.799 --> 00:32.931
You girls have fun.

00:32.967 --> 00:34.600
And if you see a ptarmigan,
don't pass them up please.

00:34.635 --> 00:35.801
IRIQTAQ: Yeah.

00:35.836 --> 00:37.236
CHIP: That'd be pretty cool
if they catch some rabbits.

00:37.271 --> 00:39.371
We'd get something to
munch, and then, uh,
I can take the scraps.

00:39.407 --> 00:41.774
Nothing gets wasted.

00:45.546 --> 00:46.745
IRIQTAQ: No.

00:56.023 --> 00:58.624
We're about to go get
some willows, so we
can make some snares.

00:58.659 --> 01:00.059
That's the first step.

01:00.094 --> 01:03.162
And then hopefully the
willows and the snares
will get us our bait.

01:03.197 --> 01:05.664
My dad, he's gonna be doing
a lot of trapping this year,

01:05.699 --> 01:09.268
so the more bait
we have for my dad, the
more traps he get to set.

01:10.137 --> 01:13.338
The more animals are
attracted, and the
more skins we get,

01:13.774 --> 01:15.808
and the more stuff
we get to sell.

01:15.843 --> 01:17.976
So it all falls in together.

01:20.481 --> 01:22.548
IRIQTAQ: Yeah, that's fine.

01:25.286 --> 01:27.219
Hey, there's
ptarmigan right there.

01:27.555 --> 01:28.821
TINMIAQ: What are
you girls doing?

01:28.856 --> 01:30.289
IRIQTAQ: There's
ptarmigan right there.

01:39.166 --> 01:42.067
TINMIAQ: Three to the
left and one to the right.

01:45.773 --> 01:51.276
(theme music plays)

02:09.013 --> 02:10.762
IRIQTAQ: I seriously can't
see them no more, Tinmiaq.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.097
TINMIAQ: Look, they're
moving forward.

02:12.133 --> 02:14.133
Keep going forward.
There's three to the right.
Forward.

02:14.168 --> 02:15.767
Go, they're right there.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.202
Look, they're moving a little.

02:17.238 --> 02:19.138
Go shoot them, go shoot them,
they're right over here.

02:19.173 --> 02:20.973
Three to the right,
one to the left.

02:22.877 --> 02:25.444
IRIQTAQ: I seriously can't
see them anymore, bro.

02:27.181 --> 02:29.581
I don't know, am I that blind?

02:30.651 --> 02:32.651
CAROL: They ran into
the bushes already.

02:32.686 --> 02:35.020
They spooked out.

02:35.055 --> 02:37.723
IRIQTAQ: Blast, the birdies.

02:37.758 --> 02:41.093
I took my eyes off of them for
a second and they disappeared.

02:41.128 --> 02:42.828
But, um, we'll
see another bunch.

02:42.863 --> 02:44.196
There's lot out there.

02:44.231 --> 02:46.498
Try again some other time.

02:46.534 --> 02:47.966
They seriously disappeared.

02:48.002 --> 02:50.936
CAROL: That's what they
were made for, disappearing.

02:51.205 --> 02:54.540
TINMIAQ: A few ptarmigan
flew past us, but they, uh,
went into the willows already.

02:54.575 --> 02:56.141
And they're all camouflaged.

02:56.177 --> 02:57.409
So these one's got away.

02:57.444 --> 02:59.278
But if we see any more,
we'll try to get them.

02:59.313 --> 03:02.347
Me and Carol will
cut down a bunch.

03:02.383 --> 03:03.682
You'll throw them in the sled?

03:03.717 --> 03:04.883
IRIQTAQ: Yeah.

03:04.919 --> 03:08.053
Throw any willows this way
and I'll put them in the sled.

03:09.490 --> 03:13.425
CAROL: I'm looking for kind
of thick willows, so the
rabbit won't snap them easy.

03:15.196 --> 03:16.828
IRIQTAQ: Fifteen
each, huh, Caroline?

03:16.864 --> 03:18.897
CAROL: Yeah, 15 each is good.

03:18.933 --> 03:19.998
That's what dad said.

03:20.034 --> 03:22.134
TINMIAQ: Cutting some
willows for some snares.

03:22.169 --> 03:25.938
Get us some bait before we
head out to Kiwalik for my
dad and mom's trap line.

03:28.976 --> 03:32.244
IRIQTAQ: That looks so good,
this look like a good bundle.

03:34.048 --> 03:36.148
TINMIAQ: Let's go turn
these willows into snares.

03:36.183 --> 03:37.349
CAROL: Sounds great.

03:37.384 --> 03:39.751
IRIQTAQ: Sounds
like a great idea.

03:43.457 --> 03:48.460
SUE: If you can't adjust
to the changing tide, don't
put your feet in the water.

03:57.238 --> 03:58.337
It's a poopy day.

03:58.372 --> 04:00.305
I can't do any of
my outside chores.

04:00.341 --> 04:03.742
So I'm thinking,
I like to make things...

04:03.777 --> 04:06.144
Maybe I'd like to
make a set of bolas.

04:06.180 --> 04:09.248
<i> NARRATOR: Isolated</i>
<i> at Kavik River Camp,</i>
<i> it is key for Sue Aikens</i>

04:09.283 --> 04:13.285
<i> to learn survival skills</i>
<i> from those who inhabited</i>
<i> the tundra long before her.</i>

04:14.688 --> 04:19.057
<i> Today she will use harvested</i>
<i> materials to make a bola,</i>
<i> a primitive weapon that will</i>

04:19.093 --> 04:22.261
<i> allow her to hunt small game</i>
<i> without using ammunition.</i>

04:23.330 --> 04:28.300
SUE: The Inuit, and Eskimos,
and the indigenous people,
they didn't all have a

04:28.302 --> 04:29.801
high-powered rifle.

04:29.837 --> 04:32.170
They had sticks and stones.

04:32.206 --> 04:34.606
This is something I
found this summer.

04:34.642 --> 04:35.941
I do a lot of hikes.

04:35.976 --> 04:37.342
I look for a lot of things.

04:37.378 --> 04:40.112
And this is actually, it's
a hunting tool called bolas.

04:41.181 --> 04:44.232
You try to get two
rocks of the same or
equal weight and size.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.318
And then a third one that's
either lighter or heavier.

04:47.021 --> 04:50.822
And you work, and
you braid the leather so
it's all three are dangling

04:50.858 --> 04:53.959
from about three foot.

04:54.261 --> 04:58.096
Depending on what you're
after, you'd throw it
at the caribou's legs.

04:58.098 --> 05:00.732
It would wrap around,
and they'd fall down.

05:01.001 --> 05:03.735
With the ptarmigan,
birds have hollow bones.

05:03.771 --> 05:06.204
The percussion is
gonna crush some bones.

05:06.240 --> 05:08.774
You're not trying to
kill it with the stones.

05:10.277 --> 05:13.312
You're trying to incapacitate
it, so you can get there.

05:18.519 --> 05:20.752
I need to go and
create leather.

05:20.788 --> 05:25.691
The only piece that I have
of fur and leather that
I'm willing to sacrifice

05:25.726 --> 05:28.827
to the project is a
little summer hide.

05:29.063 --> 05:32.397
I'm just gonna bring my
little sled inside and start
putting things together.

05:32.800 --> 05:36.101
I need to go find that
hide, get some lime,
take the fur off of it,

05:36.136 --> 05:38.070
and then start the process.

05:38.272 --> 05:39.871
It is a little
summer weight hide.

05:39.873 --> 05:41.139
Real thin fur.

05:41.225 --> 05:42.808
Should be easy to come off.

05:42.826 --> 05:44.376
Some of those hides get nasty,

05:44.411 --> 05:47.279
nasty with the,
uh, bugs that bore
through them and more

05:47.314 --> 05:49.681
like, it's not good
for sewing a parka.

05:49.750 --> 05:52.351
It is good for getting
little strips of leather.

05:52.386 --> 05:54.419
Here we go.

05:55.055 --> 05:58.990
It's just, uh, this is the
lime and it's gonna change
the pH of its environment to

05:59.026 --> 06:02.461
convince those pores to open
up and let go of the hairs.

06:03.497 --> 06:06.164
What I wanna do is like
right here, I can pull,

06:06.166 --> 06:10.168
pull on this
fur and it's locked tight.

06:11.638 --> 06:15.107
Where it was been sitting
in the water, it's starting
to come free a little bit.

06:16.377 --> 06:17.442
Whew.

06:17.478 --> 06:20.912
I wanna make sure
I'm soaking it well.

06:23.450 --> 06:26.618
There's bugs, bugs, bugs,
bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs.

06:27.454 --> 06:32.090
This little dude had a
lot of the, uh, warble
flies that it imbedded.

06:33.627 --> 06:38.830
So if you can imagine
when it's done, there's my
three-foot sections that I'll

06:38.832 --> 06:40.699
be able to glean.

06:40.734 --> 06:44.403
The next thing I wanna
do is, uh, try and maybe
look for some rocks.

06:46.874 --> 06:49.341
It's like putting myself
on a scavenger hunt.

06:49.343 --> 06:50.409
Oh.

06:50.444 --> 06:52.043
I am a little kid inside.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.613
I am curious.

06:55.315 --> 06:57.082
Uh, I think he's a little big.

06:57.101 --> 06:59.885
I do wanna play, but
I wanna make it count.

06:59.920 --> 07:04.890
I'm old enough to know why
there has to be a payoff, but
young enough to wanna try.

07:05.092 --> 07:08.860
I'm gonna grab extras
because what looks good
out here in the snow,

07:08.896 --> 07:12.297
I may get it inside
and discover, "What the
hell was I thinking?"

07:15.102 --> 07:16.968
Too big. Too big.

07:17.004 --> 07:18.236
Too little.

07:18.272 --> 07:19.905
This guy look good.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.574
Kind of says,
"Put me in a bag and
let me hit a bird."

07:24.077 --> 07:27.145
All right, I think I have
enough to get going on this.

07:27.881 --> 07:29.314
This is a nice
little pile of rocks.

07:29.349 --> 07:30.949
I've got a good selection.

07:30.984 --> 07:32.751
I think I've got a really
good start on this.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.252
I'm pretty excited.

07:34.288 --> 07:38.123
And it's a good indoor
project because outdoor
kind of sucks right now.

07:45.165 --> 07:47.365
ANDY: There's nothing
constant on the Yukon.

07:47.734 --> 07:50.535
Every week looks totally
different on the Yukon River.

07:56.610 --> 08:02.147
Uh, it's time to do some
training for G and for Naty.

08:07.688 --> 08:09.221
So I'm trying to figure out
which dogs I wanna take.
You wanna go, G?

08:09.257 --> 08:10.556
Look what I got for you.

08:10.591 --> 08:12.725
You got pretty blue for you.

08:12.994 --> 08:14.560
Pretty blue for you.

08:14.595 --> 08:16.996
Yeah, you ready to go?

08:17.031 --> 08:19.298
He says, "Man, I
haven't been run much."

08:20.168 --> 08:22.034
<i> NARRATOR:</i>
<i> For Andy Bassich,</i>

08:22.069 --> 08:25.838
<i> maintaining a kennel of</i>
<i> sled dogs along the Yukon</i>
<i> River is a way of life,</i>

08:26.073 --> 08:29.275
<i> as they allow him to</i>
<i> access and haul resources</i>
<i> throughout dark winter.</i>

08:30.411 --> 08:33.412
<i> Training young dogs to</i>
<i> become members of the team</i>
<i> is a demanding process.</i>

08:34.382 --> 08:39.118
<i> And after breaking in Naty</i>
<i> and G last winter, they must</i>
<i> again be put to the test.</i>

08:39.754 --> 08:43.522
ANDY: So the dogs haven't
been run much since
their, uh, their training,

08:43.558 --> 08:46.592
initial fundamental
training in the springtime.

08:47.328 --> 08:50.596
I feel last year I gave Naty
and G a great foundation.

08:50.631 --> 08:54.800
Uh, they understand the
basics, but we really didn't
have the time before the warm

08:54.836 --> 08:58.704
weather came and took away
all the snow to really get
into some in-depth training.

08:58.739 --> 09:02.508
The big goal this
year with Naty and G is to
teach them to work, to pull,

09:02.543 --> 09:05.311
and also, uh,
more importantly, uh,

09:05.346 --> 09:08.547
I wanna see what their
potential is for being
a lead dog in the future.

09:09.917 --> 09:14.186
So onenow
is Naty's, Naty's in heat,

09:14.655 --> 09:18.691
and she's in the part of her
cycle where she definitely
take if she got bred.

09:18.726 --> 09:22.828
So I got to be super
careful about not letting
G jump her and breed her.

09:23.631 --> 09:27.099
G is the only male dog
in my kennel that is
intact for breeding,

09:27.902 --> 09:31.971
so I've got to be
extremely careful with
him around his sister.

09:32.006 --> 09:34.073
I don't want inbred dogs.

09:34.108 --> 09:35.941
For G, it's gonna
be really tough.

09:35.977 --> 09:39.111
The drive when a female
goes in heat is pretty
tough on the males.

09:39.881 --> 09:41.814
It really kind of
messes with their head.

09:41.849 --> 09:44.483
They have a hard
time focusing.

09:44.719 --> 09:49.188
All right, see the
commotion you caused, Naty,

09:50.658 --> 09:53.225
huh, you see that?

09:53.261 --> 09:55.694
Starting out today, I'm
gonna put G up front.

09:55.763 --> 09:59.932
I know he's a harder
worker, so I'm hoping that
he'll just focus on running.

09:59.967 --> 10:03.302
But with Naty behind
him, I might have to do
some adjustments here.

10:03.337 --> 10:04.570
All right, let's
go get some wood.

10:04.605 --> 10:07.139
Hup, hup, attaboys!

10:11.078 --> 10:13.913
Attaboys, good boy, Krug.

10:14.182 --> 10:16.549
Whoa, easy, easy.

10:17.652 --> 10:22.421
It's gonna be a real test
to see how G can handle the
natural forces when a female's

10:22.456 --> 10:24.056
in heat around him.

10:24.091 --> 10:27.059
I'm gonna have to be
really careful that this sled
doesn't get away from me and

10:27.094 --> 10:28.761
he can catch up to her.

10:28.796 --> 10:31.664
As long as the line is
tight, everything is good.

10:31.699 --> 10:34.833
Haw, haw, ho, ho, ho.

10:35.436 --> 10:38.403
Straight ahead,
straight ahead.

10:38.406 --> 10:40.206
Attaboy, straight ahead.

10:40.241 --> 10:42.107
Hup, hup, on by, let's go.

10:42.143 --> 10:44.076
Straight, no,
no, no, no, whoa!

10:45.813 --> 10:47.780
I'm having a lot of
problems with G right now.

10:47.815 --> 10:50.516
He's, uh, he's just
being a bonehead.

10:50.551 --> 10:51.717
He's turning around.

10:51.752 --> 10:53.319
He's trying to
get back to Naty.

10:53.354 --> 10:55.554
The team's getting tangled up.

10:55.590 --> 10:57.489
And, uh, it's just
a real problem.

10:57.525 --> 11:00.826
So I'm gonna
switch him out and see
if things straighten out a

11:00.861 --> 11:03.662
little bit better here.

11:03.698 --> 11:05.931
Come on, Naty, we're
moving you up in the world.

11:05.967 --> 11:07.166
Look at that.

11:07.201 --> 11:09.969
This guy right here,
he's a pain in the butt.

11:10.004 --> 11:12.538
Come on back here.

11:12.573 --> 11:13.606
Good boy.

11:13.641 --> 11:15.040
Now, you're gonna work hard.

11:15.076 --> 11:17.142
This guy, he's just really
worked up right now.

11:17.178 --> 11:18.410
And I can't blame him.

11:18.446 --> 11:20.079
It's just a part
of being a dog.

11:20.114 --> 11:23.282
It's just a part of the
breeding cycle that happens.

11:23.317 --> 11:24.650
He's gonna be a wheel dog.

11:24.685 --> 11:27.152
She's gonna be a swing dog.

11:27.188 --> 11:29.521
She's gonna be the
carrot on the stick.

11:29.557 --> 11:32.758
And he's gonna run
like crazy to try and
catch that carrot.

11:33.194 --> 11:35.094
Hup, hup.

11:35.663 --> 11:37.563
Attaboy, good boy, G.

11:37.598 --> 11:39.098
Attagirl, Naty.

11:39.133 --> 11:41.867
Definitely working a lot
better with G behind Naty.

11:41.902 --> 11:43.602
That's a good boy.

11:43.638 --> 11:45.704
I have to remember
they're still young dogs.

11:45.740 --> 11:48.774
They may be full size,
but they're still very
young in their heads.

11:49.243 --> 11:50.776
So I've got to go slow.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.111
I've got to go easy.

11:52.146 --> 11:56.482
So that they can become
great members of my dog team.

11:59.620 --> 12:02.855
RICKO: Survival has to
be kind of second nature
when you're way out here.

12:02.890 --> 12:05.958
You got to be ready for
any variable that happens.

12:27.715 --> 12:29.248
My name is Ricko Dewilde.

12:29.283 --> 12:30.883
I'm from the North Fork
of the Huslia River.

12:30.918 --> 12:34.653
I was born and raised
out here in the woods
at my family's cabin.

12:35.623 --> 12:38.157
We had to learn how to catch
rabbits at an early age.

12:38.225 --> 12:40.609
That's kind of like the
kindergarten of survival.

12:41.195 --> 12:43.829
My girlfriend and I, we
have five kids together.

12:43.864 --> 12:46.532
We get them out here
as much as we can.

12:47.668 --> 12:51.470
Teach them all the ways of
the life of living out here.

12:51.806 --> 12:54.573
I hunt, I fish,
I gather, trap.

12:55.009 --> 12:56.075
I can build things.

12:56.110 --> 12:57.209
I can fix things.

12:57.244 --> 12:59.712
And I can break things.

13:01.048 --> 13:04.316
Society is a jungle to
me compared to out here.

13:04.585 --> 13:07.486
Out, out here is a jungle
but at least I know what's
what, and where's where,

13:07.488 --> 13:09.421
and who's against me.

13:09.457 --> 13:13.092
Maybe someone in
the city might think
I'm like a caveman,

13:13.127 --> 13:15.327
but I feel like I'm
a doctor out here.

13:15.363 --> 13:18.664
In the city, you could be
wrong a million times in
one day and you won't die.

13:18.699 --> 13:20.499
Out here, you could
be wrong once.

13:20.534 --> 13:23.635
That's it.
You don't get another chance.

13:25.606 --> 13:28.874
<i> NARRATOR: After</i>
<i> traveling 49 miles from</i>
<i> the village of Huslia,</i>

13:28.909 --> 13:33.979
<i> Ricko Dewilde has returned to</i>
<i> his family's isolated cabin</i>
<i> deep in Alaska's interior.</i>

13:35.449 --> 13:39.418
<i> He will use this lodging</i>
<i> throughout dark winter as a</i>
<i> staging area to maintain his</i>

13:39.453 --> 13:41.453
<i> lifestyle in the wild.</i>

13:41.489 --> 13:45.124
<i> But after a long absence,</i>
<i> he must be wary of potential</i>
<i> threats to his safety.</i>

13:49.663 --> 13:51.830
RICKO: My cabin is
just right down here.

13:51.866 --> 13:56.502
There's been, uh,
grizzly getting in the
cabin in the summers.

13:57.972 --> 14:01.673
I wanna just look at it
real close before I go in,
because the last thing you

14:01.709 --> 14:04.910
want to do is pull up and
get off like it's all gravy,

14:04.945 --> 14:07.813
and then have one
of them come rushing out.

14:09.750 --> 14:12.518
Ooh, it's deep snow.

14:12.753 --> 14:14.753
There's a lot of claw
marks around here.

14:14.789 --> 14:16.922
Obviously, a bear
got in there.

14:16.957 --> 14:18.624
The window is busted open.

14:18.659 --> 14:20.159
The, uh, door is pushed open.

14:20.194 --> 14:24.329
Grizzlies are known to sleep
in these cabins sometimes.

14:24.799 --> 14:26.165
I'm not taking no chance.

14:26.200 --> 14:29.435
I got a, uh, .375
African safari rifle.

14:29.470 --> 14:32.971
Uh, much better
than a .308.

14:33.007 --> 14:36.408
You know, closed quarters
like that with something huge,
I'm not taking no chance.

14:36.444 --> 14:39.511
I'm gonna take out
the heavy hitter.

14:41.415 --> 14:42.647
Locked and loaded.

14:42.650 --> 14:45.184
Ready to go.

14:52.526 --> 14:56.462
Make a nice little escape
route here, in case
I need to run back out.

14:57.665 --> 15:01.099
If there's a grizzly in
there, he ain't, he's
not gonna just leave.

15:01.135 --> 15:02.434
One of us got to go down.

15:02.470 --> 15:05.304
So hopefully it's him, not me.

15:11.512 --> 15:12.811
RICKO: Hey.

15:15.983 --> 15:19.451
The last time I was
here was last summer.

15:19.687 --> 15:22.955
You know, worst-case scenario,
there's a grizzly in there.

15:26.961 --> 15:28.961
Tore that pole
down right here.

15:28.996 --> 15:33.165
It's a big animal that
snapped that pole like that.

15:35.569 --> 15:39.037
Make sure he ain't hiding
behind this stairway place.

15:39.240 --> 15:42.441
Make sure he ain't
laying down nowhere.

15:43.177 --> 15:46.144
Not trying to get jumped on.

15:48.582 --> 15:51.350
Okay, looks clear down here.

15:53.521 --> 15:56.555
I got to check that upstairs.

15:58.726 --> 16:01.126
I'll make a little noise.

16:01.161 --> 16:04.763
If he's, if he's
waiting, I wanna make
him make some noise too.

16:06.600 --> 16:08.734
One of the things
about the big animal,

16:08.836 --> 16:10.736
it's easy to make
mistakes messing with them.

16:10.771 --> 16:12.304
That's the power of the bear.

16:12.339 --> 16:15.574
So I ain't trying
to make no mistakes.

16:19.179 --> 16:21.947
Okay, clear.

16:22.216 --> 16:24.349
Okay, that makes
me feel better now.

16:24.451 --> 16:25.951
That's a bad thing
to walk into.

16:25.986 --> 16:29.688
If it's sleeping in there,
you know, not knowing
what's in there is, uh,

16:29.723 --> 16:32.691
it's a little bit,
it's a little hairy.

16:32.960 --> 16:34.826
You can't take a chance
with something like that.

16:34.862 --> 16:38.497
That's a big animal,
and, uh, it'll, it'll take
you out if you walk into

16:38.532 --> 16:40.499
something like that unprepared.

16:40.534 --> 16:43.001
So I'm just glad it
ain't in here denned up.

16:43.037 --> 16:46.538
It came in, it broke some
stuff up, chewed some stuff
up, but, uh, I could fix,

16:46.574 --> 16:49.041
fix whatever it broke
and be good again.

16:49.643 --> 16:52.461
It'll be my home again.

16:52.680 --> 16:57.115
Definitely was a bear in
here, but there definitely
is no bear in here.

16:57.685 --> 16:59.484
That's a relief.

17:02.656 --> 17:05.958
SUE: This is a limited time
offer I've got on this planet.

17:05.993 --> 17:08.160
I wanna see things.

17:17.938 --> 17:21.073
Time for me to see how
this hide is doing.

17:22.242 --> 17:24.643
It should be good.

17:24.945 --> 17:29.081
<i> NARRATOR: In Kavik, a</i>
<i> winter storm has forced Sue</i>
<i> to shelter herself indoors.</i>

17:29.116 --> 17:33.285
<i> To maximize her time,</i>
<i> Sue is using harvested</i>
<i> materials to make a bola,</i>

17:33.654 --> 17:36.588
<i> an ancient hunting</i>
<i> weapon that will allow</i>
<i> her to hunt Kavik's</i>

17:36.690 --> 17:38.590
<i> small game cost-effectively.</i>

17:40.694 --> 17:42.294
SUE: I've never made
a bola in my life.

17:42.329 --> 17:43.862
I've never thrown one.

17:43.897 --> 17:47.633
But finding one on my own,
it's a little sign from
the universe that says,

17:47.668 --> 17:49.601
"Try it, why not."

17:49.637 --> 17:53.538
I don't want something
super sharp, but you
wanna be able to scrape all

17:53.540 --> 17:55.874
the fur off.

17:56.844 --> 17:59.411
You're trying to go
against the grain.

18:00.581 --> 18:03.081
Hmm.

18:03.117 --> 18:05.317
It does take a while.

18:06.520 --> 18:10.589
It may seem like an awful
lot of trouble to go and
make something like this,

18:13.961 --> 18:17.663
but I like challenging
myself, and I like doing
things historically, you know,

18:18.365 --> 18:20.966
the way that they
would have done them.

18:21.001 --> 18:25.771
All righty, I wanna give
myself a nice straight
edge so I can cut.

18:26.940 --> 18:30.642
I need to have about
24 to 28 inches.

18:31.045 --> 18:34.579
Doesn't matter to me at
all if these are a little
thin, a little thick.

18:34.615 --> 18:37.816
The strength is gonna,
not gonna be coming from
this very, very thin skin.

18:38.986 --> 18:42.354
The strength is gonna come
from when I braid it together.

18:42.389 --> 18:46.158
Okay, now I'm gonna
be braiding it.

18:46.460 --> 18:49.528
Now these thin
little strips are gonna
dry out really fast,

18:49.563 --> 18:51.930
so I'm trying to get this done.

18:51.965 --> 18:56.068
Yeah, once this stuff
does dry, man, it'll
be wicked strong.

18:56.970 --> 18:59.237
Ugh.

19:01.341 --> 19:03.341
Ta-da!

19:03.777 --> 19:05.143
A bola.

19:05.179 --> 19:08.180
Pretty cool.

19:11.585 --> 19:14.986
I can tell it's gonna
take some practice.

19:15.422 --> 19:16.855
I don't wanna stretch
this too much.

19:16.890 --> 19:18.657
I want this to dry now.

19:18.692 --> 19:21.893
So no more playing, Suzie.

19:24.965 --> 19:26.498
ANDY: You either
do it or you don't.

19:26.533 --> 19:28.467
You either are
successful or you fail.

19:28.502 --> 19:31.603
There's a lot of black and
white living in this world.

19:34.141 --> 19:35.607
Good boy, Foge.

19:35.642 --> 19:37.042
Good boy, Gambo.

19:37.077 --> 19:39.244
You guys ready to
go get some wood?

19:39.279 --> 19:41.279
You guys ready to
go get some wood?

19:41.315 --> 19:43.381
All right, let's go get G-man.

19:43.417 --> 19:47.819
<i> NARRATOR: In Eagle, Andy</i>
<i> is in the final stages of</i>
<i> acclimating Naty and G to</i>

19:47.921 --> 19:51.456
<i> becoming full-fledged</i>
<i> members of his dog team.</i>

19:51.492 --> 19:53.725
<i> But training young</i>
<i> dogs is difficult,</i>

19:53.761 --> 19:55.761
<i> and Andy must take</i>
<i> every precaution to make sure</i>

19:55.796 --> 19:57.696
<i> they reach their potential.</i>

19:57.731 --> 20:01.600
ANDY: So yesterday's run
with, uh, the G-man and
Naty went super good.

20:03.137 --> 20:05.237
A lot of confusion
because she's in heat,

20:05.272 --> 20:07.239
so that was a little
bit frustrating at times,

20:07.274 --> 20:11.810
but they both
were working hard,
and, uh, they ran with it.

20:12.446 --> 20:16.448
I decided I'm gonna leave
Naty behind because G
is just really distracted

20:16.483 --> 20:18.250
with her being in heat.

20:18.285 --> 20:22.487
And I think what I need to
do is I need to just focus
on G alone, in the team.

20:22.956 --> 20:26.591
It's, uh, it's interesting
how dogs can have such
different personalities.

20:26.627 --> 20:27.926
Even siblings.

20:27.961 --> 20:29.661
You could see he's
really excitable.

20:29.696 --> 20:32.164
He has kind of a hard time
controlling his emotions.

20:32.199 --> 20:34.699
He's kind of like me.

20:34.902 --> 20:36.368
You take after me, G?

20:36.470 --> 20:39.204
He says, "I don't
cuss as much as you do."

20:39.406 --> 20:41.473
So I'm gonna just hook
them up into the team,

20:41.508 --> 20:44.075
and then we're, we're
gonna go like heck and
go get a load of wood.

20:44.111 --> 20:45.177
Good boys.

20:45.212 --> 20:46.511
Everybody stay.

20:46.547 --> 20:48.580
Lots of challenges
for the G-man today.

20:48.615 --> 20:50.715
I hope his head's clear
and he's up for it.

20:50.751 --> 20:52.150
On your feet, on your feet!

20:52.186 --> 20:53.251
Come on, Krug.

20:53.287 --> 20:55.487
Hup, gee, gee, gee, gee!

20:55.522 --> 20:57.889
Okay, let's go now,
straight ahead.

20:58.125 --> 21:01.693
What a lot of people don't
realize about dog mushing
is it's 100% controlled

21:01.728 --> 21:03.328
by voice and commands.

21:03.363 --> 21:07.716
There are no
reins, like horses.

21:09.152 --> 21:11.553
A lead dog is by far
the most critical part.

21:11.588 --> 21:13.788
He's kind of the
quarterback of the team.

21:13.824 --> 21:16.858
And without a
good lead dog, you don't
have much of an offense.

21:19.229 --> 21:23.498
Easy, easy, gee, gee,
gee, gee, attaboy.

21:25.502 --> 21:28.470
This fall when I was
out training the dogs
along the Yukon River,

21:28.505 --> 21:31.506
I stockpiled really
nice dry wood along
the river bank here.

21:32.409 --> 21:35.977
And the intent was to
try and come back as soon
as I could with the dogs,

21:36.013 --> 21:37.746
get some easy, dry wood.

21:37.781 --> 21:39.548
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:39.583 --> 21:41.283
Stay right there.

21:41.318 --> 21:43.151
Good, Krug. Perfect.

21:43.186 --> 21:44.753
This is good, dry
spruce right here.

21:44.788 --> 21:47.088
I wanna get this loaded
into my sled, take it home.

21:47.124 --> 21:50.292
It's gonna be
top-quality firewood.

21:54.298 --> 21:55.630
G, he's getting it.

21:55.666 --> 21:57.532
He's definitely a little
more focused today.

21:57.568 --> 22:00.769
You can see he's, he's
behaving, he's focused,
he's working hard.

22:00.804 --> 22:02.771
Everything's
going good so far.

22:02.873 --> 22:06.474
But what I wanna do right
now is I wanna see what he
does running with Kruggerand.

22:07.177 --> 22:09.110
You wanna be a lead dog, G?

22:09.146 --> 22:10.211
Look at that.

22:10.247 --> 22:12.881
You're gonna be a lead
dog for a little bit.

22:12.916 --> 22:14.182
It's okay, Krug.

22:14.217 --> 22:15.483
Be nice to him.

22:15.519 --> 22:17.986
He's just a beginner.

22:19.389 --> 22:21.289
Straight ahead,
let's go, hup, hup, hup!

22:21.325 --> 22:22.490
Let's go.

22:22.526 --> 22:24.159
Attaboys, let's go, hup.

22:24.194 --> 22:26.027
Being a lead dog's a
pretty tough position.

22:26.063 --> 22:27.629
You got to have a
lot of confidence.

22:27.664 --> 22:30.432
You got to be able to listen
and respond to me really well.

22:30.467 --> 22:32.534
Maybe G will be a lead
dog in the future.

22:32.569 --> 22:36.037
We're gonna find out
whether he's got that
head space for it.

22:36.073 --> 22:37.305
Attaboy, G!

22:37.341 --> 22:40.008
That's the way
to work and pull.

22:40.677 --> 22:42.577
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
tighten up, tighten up.

22:42.613 --> 22:43.712
Let's go, come on!

22:43.747 --> 22:45.947
Hup, hup, hup, hup,
hup, hup, hup, hup, hup.

22:45.983 --> 22:47.115
Come on, dig in.

22:47.150 --> 22:49.084
Let's go, come on,
come on, come on.

22:49.119 --> 22:52.153
Uh, stalled out, (bleep)!

22:53.590 --> 22:55.223
ANDY: Tighten up, tighte

22:55.258 --> 22:57.525
Hup, hup, hup, hup,
hup, hup, hup, hup, hup.

22:57.561 --> 22:58.727
Come on, dig in.

22:58.762 --> 23:00.929
Let's go, come on,
come on, come on.

23:01.832 --> 23:04.532
Uh, stalled out, (bleep)!

23:07.638 --> 23:08.870
Didn't quite make
it up the hill.

23:08.905 --> 23:10.171
Almost.

23:10.207 --> 23:13.241
It's all about
momentum with the dogs.

23:13.276 --> 23:17.445
And I didn't have the
momentum to get quite
over that edge there.

23:17.481 --> 23:20.915
So I don't know if I'm
gonna be able to get them
going from here or not.

23:20.951 --> 23:22.751
I'll see.

23:22.786 --> 23:23.918
Okay, let's go home!

23:23.954 --> 23:25.520
Hup, hup, hup, that's it!

23:25.555 --> 23:26.755
Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go!

23:26.790 --> 23:28.156
Hup, dig in, let's go!

23:28.191 --> 23:30.091
Hup, hup, hup, come on, go!

23:30.127 --> 23:32.160
Come on, come on!

23:32.195 --> 23:34.929
Almost, okay, tighten up!

23:35.332 --> 23:36.731
Hup, hup, hup!

23:36.767 --> 23:38.600
That's it, yeah, yeah, yeah!

23:38.635 --> 23:41.803
Woo, all right, good boys!

23:42.139 --> 23:45.073
All right, good boys!

23:45.742 --> 23:47.142
Yay, G!

23:47.177 --> 23:48.276
G's the lead dog!

23:48.311 --> 23:49.778
Sort of, kinda.

23:49.813 --> 23:51.346
Just sorta, kinda.

23:51.381 --> 23:54.115
That was pretty good
for your first time ever
though, I gotta say.

23:54.851 --> 23:56.351
It was a good training run.

23:56.386 --> 23:58.987
It was a good experience
to see that he's got
potential for working with,

23:59.022 --> 24:00.789
um, being a lead dog.

24:00.824 --> 24:04.125
I think I'm gonna be
able to add two more good
lead dogs to my team by

24:04.177 --> 24:07.028
the end of the winter.

24:09.966 --> 24:13.134
CHIP: It's really important
to make sure that my kids can
make a living around them.

24:13.170 --> 24:15.270
I want them to know their
limits, but I want them
to know that there's no

24:15.305 --> 24:17.572
boundaries, either.

24:26.783 --> 24:27.982
AGNES: This is gonna be fun!

24:28.018 --> 24:29.884
Baby's first
snaring trip, huh?

24:29.920 --> 24:31.419
You go play out?

24:31.455 --> 24:34.322
Go to the snaring place,
where the rabbits hop?

24:34.758 --> 24:36.925
CHIP: These are
the willows that the girls
went out and got, and, um,

24:36.960 --> 24:40.929
I pared them down for 'em
and added the snare to 'em,
and their mom's gonna go

24:40.964 --> 24:43.465
show 'em where she used to
set rabbit snares.

24:43.500 --> 24:45.967
Right now, we've got
a pretty high rate of
rabbits around here.

24:46.002 --> 24:49.437
They're cycling up, they
make an excellent bait, they
make an excellent dinner.

24:49.473 --> 24:51.372
Um, you can use
every part of 'em.

24:51.408 --> 24:54.476
The guts, the feet, the
head, the skin, for trapping.

24:54.511 --> 24:57.312
The thing is that, if
these girls go out and
get me a bunch of bait,

24:57.347 --> 25:00.081
it'll come back to 'em,
when I trap something
as a piece of fur.

25:07.457 --> 25:11.059
AGNES: It's real nice for
me to go out with my children
and go set some rabbit snares.

25:11.094 --> 25:14.496
It's just a fun thing
to do with children.

25:15.632 --> 25:17.799
Wow!

25:18.235 --> 25:19.434
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:19.469 --> 25:21.002
Try stop right
here for a minute.

25:21.037 --> 25:22.437
See lots of tracks?

25:22.472 --> 25:23.938
They're all over.

25:23.974 --> 25:25.974
CAROL: Lot, how 'bout
you guys stick to this
side and me and Ting will

25:26.009 --> 25:27.308
stick to this side?

25:27.344 --> 25:29.010
AGNES: All right.
IRIQTAQ: Sounds good.

25:29.045 --> 25:31.212
AGNES: Just go along all
the way up to the tree line.

25:31.248 --> 25:32.647
TINMIAQ: Don't forget
where you put them, okay?

25:32.682 --> 25:35.617
CAROL: Won't,
I'm good at this.

25:35.886 --> 25:40.054
AGNES: The way you catch a
rabbit to me, is to put this
snare right over the path.

25:40.090 --> 25:43.024
You can see where they're,
they're going, here.

25:43.059 --> 25:47.529
And you want the snare about
that high off the ground.

25:47.564 --> 25:50.598
Usually that's where
the rabbit get caught.

25:50.967 --> 25:53.334
To me, it's very important
that I pass down the knowledge

25:53.370 --> 25:55.703
from my elders
that I was taught,

25:55.739 --> 25:58.973
and it's very
important that you keep,
um, teaching your children,

25:59.009 --> 26:03.545
so they can pass it onto
their children, and with the
grandson growing up with us,

26:03.580 --> 26:05.747
and around us,
it's pretty exciting.

26:06.316 --> 26:09.484
Just having that little
boy, someone to teach.

26:09.853 --> 26:13.054
Wow.

26:14.124 --> 26:15.957
CAROL: Woo, I finished
all my snares!

26:15.992 --> 26:17.625
TINMIAQ: Me too.

26:17.661 --> 26:20.328
AGNES: We gotta let them
sit overnight and we'll come
back tomorrow and check 'em.

26:20.897 --> 26:23.765
We just gotta let our snares
do the hunting for us.

26:24.668 --> 26:26.167
Makes me excited for tomorrow.

26:26.203 --> 26:27.302
CAROL: I know!

26:27.337 --> 26:28.870
TINMIAQ: Tomorrow we'll
have rabbits for dinner?

26:28.905 --> 26:30.171
CAROL: Sound like a plan, ah?

26:30.207 --> 26:32.440
AGNES: Yeah, awesome.

26:34.211 --> 26:36.060
RICKO: That's nature.
You never can predict it.

26:36.112 --> 26:39.147
You can work with it,
but you can't change it.

26:54.798 --> 26:57.065
(bleep) duck egg in my stove?

26:57.100 --> 26:59.901
A wood duck might've made a
nest in there or something.

26:59.936 --> 27:03.671
I swear to god, I have
no clue where this came from,
but it looks like a duck egg.

27:05.675 --> 27:08.476
Super trippy.

27:08.712 --> 27:12.714
<i> NARRATOR: In Huslia,</i>

27:30.066 --> 27:31.299
RICKO: Oof!

27:31.334 --> 27:33.668
I never see the stove
smoke like this before.

27:33.703 --> 27:35.870
Oh (bleep), I better
shut that down.

27:35.906 --> 27:37.705
That chimney's plugged up.

27:38.775 --> 27:41.209
I should've checked
the chimney first.

27:41.511 --> 27:44.512
Okay, I gotta
climb on the roof.

27:52.022 --> 27:54.889
Hoo, this is an old ladder!

27:56.526 --> 27:59.727
Man, this snow makes
it, like, ten times
harder to move around.

28:07.437 --> 28:10.738
That was a mistake on
my part because I really
should've checked the

28:10.774 --> 28:13.708
chimney before making
a fire in there.

28:20.617 --> 28:23.818
Chimney was completely
covered in snow.

28:27.691 --> 28:30.091
Man, that's some wet snow.

28:33.363 --> 28:36.130
There it is.

28:36.166 --> 28:39.000
Chimney looks clear
all the way through.

28:39.035 --> 28:40.435
That's a good thing.

28:40.470 --> 28:44.238
I really gotta shovel this
whole roof off tomorrow.

28:45.875 --> 28:48.576
Okay, good enough.

28:51.881 --> 28:56.684
Okay, back to
making fire again.

28:59.756 --> 29:03.524
Okay, stove's looking a
little better, not smoking.

29:05.628 --> 29:07.228
Now that I got the fire going,

29:07.263 --> 29:10.231
I like to, like,
burn food just for respect,

29:10.266 --> 29:11.833
'cause, um, first time

29:11.868 --> 29:15.403
anyone been here for a
while, and it's good to pay
your respects back to the,

29:15.438 --> 29:18.940
you know, the people
that went before you.

29:18.975 --> 29:21.976
A lot of, a lot of elders,
you know, when they burn
food, it's usually outside,

29:22.012 --> 29:23.544
but, uh, I do it in the stove.

29:23.580 --> 29:25.480
My late mom used to
do that sometime.

29:25.515 --> 29:29.217
Just a little dry meat and,
um, a little bit of candy.

29:30.820 --> 29:32.286
Just, uh...

29:37.827 --> 29:43.998
Now that the stove is warm,
I'm ready to lay down,
go to sleep, call it a day.

29:44.467 --> 29:47.602
And the work begins tomorrow.

29:50.273 --> 29:54.475
SUE: Sometimes I forget to
enjoy the life I'm living,
instead of just living the

29:54.511 --> 29:57.011
life I've got.

30:04.921 --> 30:07.355
Let's see if I got any
little ptarmies close by!

30:07.991 --> 30:09.157
But I don't.

30:09.192 --> 30:12.126
Had, uh, several
days of a blow.

30:12.162 --> 30:14.729
And that's where
I made my bolas!

30:16.032 --> 30:19.600
<i> NARRATOR: Sue has added</i>
<i> a bola to her arsenal, in</i>
<i> hopes of harvesting Kavik's</i>

30:19.636 --> 30:21.836
<i> small game</i>
<i> without using ammunition.</i>

30:23.406 --> 30:25.840
<i> She must now head out into</i>
<i> the tundra to perfect her aim.</i>

30:26.943 --> 30:31.045
<i> When ready, she'll move</i>

<i> a hunt for live game.</i>

30:31.981 --> 30:33.614
SUE: I wanna do some
target practice.

30:33.650 --> 30:35.216
I've never thrown these.

30:35.251 --> 30:38.286
I've never had a set, but,
uh, I wanna give it a whirl.

30:39.122 --> 30:41.522
Well, let's just try
and aim for that, uh,
little cone right there.

30:42.826 --> 30:48.863
Supposed to be able to twirl
it over my head, and then
when I let it go, point.

30:48.865 --> 30:51.532
And I didn't get it.

30:51.868 --> 30:57.071
I should, with enough
practice, be able to come
out and just let it go

30:57.107 --> 30:58.673
and hit something.

30:58.708 --> 31:00.041
And have it be one.

31:00.076 --> 31:03.077
Right now, it feels
like I've got a octopus
off the end of my hand,

31:03.113 --> 31:04.912
and it's gonna
go flailing off.

31:04.948 --> 31:07.949
Practice is gonna
be the key, here.

31:08.451 --> 31:09.817
Ooh, I got close.

31:09.853 --> 31:12.687
Get used to it, get used
to it, get used to it.

31:14.524 --> 31:16.057
Ooh, hey, I took it out.

31:16.092 --> 31:17.825
Boom, there's a
dead ptarmigan.

31:17.861 --> 31:20.862
Once I can hit a bigger
target, we'll try
to get something more

31:20.897 --> 31:23.131
ptarmigan-sized.

31:24.167 --> 31:26.934
Oh! Almost! Rawr!

31:26.970 --> 31:28.236
The bear ate me.

31:28.271 --> 31:30.371
The high-powered rifles,
they're good, and
they have their place,

31:30.406 --> 31:32.306
and I'm definitely not
getting rid of mine.

31:32.342 --> 31:36.844
But what if I can
enhance my life by learning
how to utilize rocks,

31:37.914 --> 31:40.148
string, and air?

31:40.383 --> 31:45.753
I am the weapon, if I
choose to educate myself
and, and figure it out.

31:45.989 --> 31:48.589
You're going down.

31:54.230 --> 31:56.230
Got him.

31:56.599 --> 32:00.301
Take him, step on
his wings, and pull.

32:01.237 --> 32:02.803
And I've got dinner.

32:02.839 --> 32:07.108
I feel really confident
that, uh, I'm ready to take
it onto a, a field test.

32:08.511 --> 32:11.712
I think I'm ready to
try and get a ptarmigan.

32:13.750 --> 32:16.884
I like challenging
myself, and this is
definitely a challenge.

32:17.453 --> 32:21.822
There's absolutely
nothing super comfortable
about this whole thing.

32:22.959 --> 32:26.093
I'm an old dog, and I have
a lot of tricks in my bag.

32:27.597 --> 32:31.098
But the new tricks
I wanna learn are
actually the old ones.

32:33.069 --> 32:35.670
Okay, I see ptarmigan
tracks there.

32:35.872 --> 32:37.405
They look very fresh.

32:37.440 --> 32:39.574
It's a good sign.

32:40.677 --> 32:42.577
Um, where are you hiding?

32:42.612 --> 32:44.345
I see evidence of you.

32:45.848 --> 32:47.815
Ptarmigan!

32:48.318 --> 32:50.985
Oh, hell yeah.

32:55.058 --> 32:57.358
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.

32:57.894 --> 32:59.594
(animal call)

33:06.386 --> 33:08.653
SUE: Stay, sta

33:12.125 --> 33:13.591
Damn it.

33:13.993 --> 33:16.360
No (bleep).

33:16.396 --> 33:19.397
The minute he saw me, he
was like, "Oh, better run!"

33:20.266 --> 33:23.234
There's two more of his
buddies close by though.

33:23.269 --> 33:24.936
I'm definitely not giving up.

33:24.971 --> 33:26.571
No freaking way.

33:26.606 --> 33:28.673
They've got the edge
on me right now.

33:28.708 --> 33:31.075
But I'm persistent.

33:37.984 --> 33:40.551
AGNES: Being, like,
semi-nomadic, you
follow the seasons and

33:40.587 --> 33:42.353
you follow the animals.

33:42.388 --> 33:45.056
It's always a cycle and
its always changing.

33:54.467 --> 33:56.801
Perfect day to go
check our snares.

33:56.836 --> 33:59.537
You ready to go check
your snares, son?

33:59.572 --> 34:02.573
We got 40 snares out
there to go check.

34:02.609 --> 34:05.476
And we got a beautiful
day ahead of us.

34:12.352 --> 34:15.353
I've been excited all
morning since I got
up about the snares.

34:15.388 --> 34:19.023
We set out yesterday and I'm
hoping I catch one or two.

34:19.359 --> 34:22.893
I'm hoping the girls
catch a few rabbits.

34:23.796 --> 34:25.930
Even if we don't catch
anything out there.

34:25.965 --> 34:29.500
It's just the experience
that we have to take
my grandson out there,

34:29.535 --> 34:32.470
and it's just gonna
be an exciting day.

34:33.606 --> 34:35.006
I have a snare right there.

34:35.041 --> 34:36.807
There's nothing.

34:36.843 --> 34:39.276
CAROL: Oh, Look
one right there!

34:39.846 --> 34:41.879
AGNES: Oh, look
my snare got one!

34:41.914 --> 34:44.348
Hey, right on the path.

34:46.085 --> 34:49.620
Look, son, there should
be more because we set
40 snares yesterday.

34:50.690 --> 34:53.791
TINMIAQ: I got one too.
AGNES: You caught one also?
TINMIAQ: Yeah!

34:53.826 --> 34:55.226
AGNES: Wow.

34:55.261 --> 34:57.194
CAROL: Oh, I got one too!

34:57.230 --> 34:59.163
Look it.

34:59.666 --> 35:03.167
AGNES: We can use
the skin for a trap
bait for your taata.

35:03.202 --> 35:05.002
So, you could go put traps.

35:05.038 --> 35:06.704
TINMIAQ: Ooh.

35:06.739 --> 35:07.805
CAROL: Look.

35:07.840 --> 35:10.341
AGNES: Oh, look
Carol got one too!

35:10.376 --> 35:13.094
I need to go check
the rest of my snares but
this is a real good sign.

35:15.381 --> 35:18.049
TINMIAQ: Nothing in this one.

35:18.284 --> 35:20.518
Here's another snare but
there's nothing inside of it.

35:21.287 --> 35:23.988
Doesn't look like this
one got any either.

35:26.092 --> 35:27.625
Oh.

35:28.194 --> 35:31.262
CAROL: Oh, an animal
ate one of mine.

35:31.297 --> 35:33.464
Maybe a fox.

35:33.733 --> 35:35.132
Woo.

35:35.168 --> 35:38.069
Some animal took my rabbit.

35:39.038 --> 35:40.571
TINMIAQ: Let me see.

35:40.606 --> 35:42.406
Where did I set it?

35:42.442 --> 35:45.242
I'm looking for another
snare that I set.

35:45.278 --> 35:47.678
It's quite possible a
rabbit ran off with it.

35:47.714 --> 35:50.281
CAROL: Oh, where my snare go?

35:50.516 --> 35:52.583
Oh, there it is.

35:53.319 --> 35:56.020
Oh, oh, a bird got it too.

35:56.489 --> 36:00.191
We probably won't eat this
one 'cause a bird got into it,
but good enough for trapping.

36:02.028 --> 36:04.628
My dad will be
more than happy.

36:04.864 --> 36:07.465
AGNES: We're thinking
to make a fire and just
hang out a little bit.

36:07.500 --> 36:10.868
Um, cook up some rabbit that
we just caught and just have
a beautiful day out here.

36:11.671 --> 36:12.937
It's awesome.

36:12.972 --> 36:15.206
It's living the life.

36:20.813 --> 36:22.713
RICKO: It's a life
of purpose out here.

36:22.749 --> 36:26.150
You gotta appreciate
what you have and you
gotta earn what you have.

36:33.726 --> 36:36.527
I gotta get this
snow off for sure.

36:36.562 --> 36:38.829
It's a lot of
weight on the roof.

36:38.865 --> 36:42.466
It does cause some settling
issues with the cabin.

36:43.469 --> 36:46.971
It's important to take
care of this cabin for me
because it's something that

36:47.006 --> 36:49.306
our family put
a lot of work in.

36:49.342 --> 36:50.641
It's a beautiful piece.

36:50.676 --> 36:54.145
It's just something
that I feel like I
have to take care of.

36:55.915 --> 36:58.916
It's a lot of snow.

36:58.951 --> 37:02.820
I've never seen this much
snow that I remember, but
I'm not no pro at this.

37:04.323 --> 37:06.791
I might fall into a pattern
where it gets a little easier.

37:06.826 --> 37:09.927
I got some figuring
out to do right now.

37:10.563 --> 37:12.429
This is a six-sided
cabin too, so.

37:12.465 --> 37:16.500
Wait till I get this done,
I got five more sides to do.

37:18.671 --> 37:22.923
Might get harder on the bottom
layer 'cause there's ice
frozen through the sheet iron.

37:23.943 --> 37:25.509
Hopefully get it done today.

37:25.545 --> 37:27.912
I don't feel cold no more,
that's one good thing.

37:29.649 --> 37:32.149
I didn't realize how
much work was involved.

37:32.185 --> 37:35.352
You know, just getting settled
in, you gotta take care of the
cabin first and get it running

37:35.388 --> 37:38.956
and warm and everything
so, it takes some days
to get all situated before

37:38.958 --> 37:41.525
I can start
really venturing out.

37:46.833 --> 37:49.567
Getting slipperier
and I'm getting tired.

37:51.037 --> 37:53.704
It's starting to
get hard to do.

37:53.739 --> 37:55.072
Ah.

38:02.014 --> 38:03.514
RICKO: Whoa.

38:03.549 --> 38:04.882
Hard to do up there.

38:04.917 --> 38:07.451
It's starting to
get too slick.

38:09.455 --> 38:11.522
Starting to get fun.

38:11.557 --> 38:14.758
When you're
rolling in the snow,
you must be having fun.

38:20.633 --> 38:23.701
You kinda wanna
leave some snow.

38:23.736 --> 38:26.737
I mean, I wouldn't
mind getting all of it,
but it's just so much.

38:27.073 --> 38:30.341
It's just (bleep) piling
up and really doesn't hurt
to leave some of it anyway,

38:30.843 --> 38:32.843
because takes most
all the weight off.

38:32.879 --> 38:36.046
And it also has insulation
value having some up here.

38:44.090 --> 38:45.756
Damn.

38:45.791 --> 38:47.658
That's a lot of snow.

38:47.693 --> 38:50.561
And it took a lot of weight,
took tons off of that roof.

38:50.596 --> 38:51.962
Phew.

38:51.998 --> 38:54.965
Well, I'm glad
this chore is done.

38:57.303 --> 39:00.271
Got some moose bone soup here.

39:00.539 --> 39:03.307
Some real down-home,
hardy stuff out here.

39:03.342 --> 39:05.209
Some North Fork River soup.

39:05.244 --> 39:09.046
Being out here is kind
of, at times, I can almost
feel emotional, to me.

39:10.650 --> 39:14.752
No one's lived here since
my late parents lived here,
and it's been over 10 years.

39:14.787 --> 39:18.889
But it seems like forever
ago that they were around
here on Earth with us.

39:19.225 --> 39:24.094
But, uh, with, with them
being the last ones that lived
here, nothing is touched.

39:24.130 --> 39:28.632
I see my late dad's chair,
like he was the last one
to really use the chair.

39:29.201 --> 39:32.870
My late mom would sit over
there, she'd be, you know,
either sewing or, um,

39:32.905 --> 39:35.472
making fish nets out of twine.

39:35.508 --> 39:40.344
And the pictures, the books,
everything about this place
just really brings me back.

39:40.813 --> 39:44.615
There's times you take your
parents for granted when
they're, when they're alive,

39:44.650 --> 39:48.819
and for me to come back and
see all this and what's left
here, it's just like, um,

39:48.854 --> 39:53.324
you see what they've done
on this Earth and what they
passed on to me and it's

39:53.359 --> 39:57.728
almost like I feel
obligated to continue living
this life and come out here

39:57.763 --> 39:59.196
and use the cabin,

39:59.231 --> 40:01.832
take care of the cabin,
and continue it on,

40:01.867 --> 40:03.801
because it's a strong
part of my life and

40:03.836 --> 40:05.269
strong part of my family.

40:05.304 --> 40:08.439
Maybe one day, you know,
my son will come out
here and my daughters,

40:08.491 --> 40:11.642
and they'll see this stuff
and it'll remind them of
me, so it's important for

40:11.677 --> 40:14.044
me to carry this on.

40:14.080 --> 40:17.681
It feels like it's close
to the heart for sure.

40:20.386 --> 40:23.687
SUE: The way I view
hunting, become the
thing you're hunting.

40:30.930 --> 40:33.330
It's ptarmigan, one,
Sue, zero.

40:33.366 --> 40:36.667
But I'm not giving up yet.

40:36.902 --> 40:39.003
I'm convinced
there's more in here.

40:43.843 --> 40:45.542
They're very skittish.

40:45.578 --> 40:48.445
By swinging something
like that in the air, it's
looking like a raptor coming

40:48.481 --> 40:51.382
down on 'em and I'm
forcing them to flee.

40:51.417 --> 40:53.050
Ah!

40:53.085 --> 40:55.152
Damn, bastards.

40:55.187 --> 40:57.187
Ahh!

40:58.424 --> 41:00.391
I mean, I am getting closer.

41:00.426 --> 41:02.292
So, I'll keep going.

41:02.328 --> 41:04.294
I accept I may not
be able to do it.

41:04.330 --> 41:08.232
There is nobody teaching
me, but I'm not a person
that enjoys the words,

41:08.267 --> 41:09.700
"I can't".

41:09.735 --> 41:11.702
There's three.

41:15.808 --> 41:18.142
Ah!

41:19.211 --> 41:22.446
I'm getting close,
but not close enough.

41:23.849 --> 41:28.018
Made the discovery
that, if I see 'em, and
they're running away,

41:28.054 --> 41:31.455
if I start the business
of twirling it, they're
not as predisposed to go,

41:32.558 --> 41:34.725
"Ah," when I start.

41:34.760 --> 41:37.661
It's kind of getting a
little bit too dark, but
it's been a great day.

41:38.197 --> 41:39.496
I learned a lot.

41:39.532 --> 41:42.933
I'm not under the
illusion I'm gonna be
an ace in one day flat.

41:42.968 --> 41:45.702
It's not the first
ptarmigan I've missed.

41:45.738 --> 41:47.404
But I'm not giving up.

41:47.440 --> 41:50.307
I'm not giving out,
and I'm not giving in.

41:52.578 --> 41:55.079
ANDY: Having a dog team
is a constant evolution,

41:55.114 --> 41:56.613
depending on
the dogs you have,

41:56.649 --> 41:59.149
the dogs you lose,
the dogs you gain.

42:01.487 --> 42:02.653
Yeah, let's go.

42:02.688 --> 42:03.754
Come on.

42:03.789 --> 42:05.255
Pupper, pupper, puppers.

42:05.291 --> 42:06.356
Come on.

42:06.459 --> 42:07.691
Inside play-play.

42:07.726 --> 42:10.227
Yay, puppies in
the house, woohoo!

42:11.097 --> 42:15.299
Well, this fall, I lost
my main old long-time
leader, Iceberg, and, uh,

42:16.735 --> 42:19.636
I started thinking about
my kennel and where I need
to be in a couple years,

42:20.172 --> 42:22.506
and decided it was time
to get a couple more pups.

42:25.211 --> 42:28.212
It's pretty important
to, to make sure that
you vaccinate dogs.

42:29.381 --> 42:31.965
Try and get the air out,
it's always good to do that.

42:32.017 --> 42:34.384
Come here Carver, good boy.

42:35.521 --> 42:38.355
I'm basically the
alpha male in the pack.

42:38.390 --> 42:39.923
I'm the vet for them.

42:39.959 --> 42:40.924
Come on up.

42:40.960 --> 42:42.326
Look at you.

42:42.361 --> 42:45.062
Everybody's being so
good at coming over to
get their puppy shots!

42:45.097 --> 42:47.865
And I'm kind of the
psychologist for them.

42:47.900 --> 42:51.601
Yay, everybody's gonna
be healthy puppies now.

42:51.604 --> 42:53.904
Yay!

42:54.173 --> 42:56.173
Okay, puppy, puppy play-time.

42:56.208 --> 42:58.442
Woohoo, yay, puppies.

42:59.845 --> 43:02.179
So last year at this
time, this is about the
size that Naty and G were.

43:02.264 --> 43:05.749
They were just a couple
little poopers running around

43:05.784 --> 43:07.718
peeing in my house.

43:07.753 --> 43:10.587
And then next year
at this time, I'll be going
out with these little guys

43:10.623 --> 43:13.423
to see what they can do.

43:13.592 --> 43:15.125
I love having my dogs.

43:15.161 --> 43:16.793
I think they love having me.

43:16.829 --> 43:19.296
I don't think I
could ever live out in the
bush without having some

43:19.331 --> 43:22.199
sled dogs around me.

43:27.173 --> 43:30.807
AGNES: We try to
use everything that we hunt
and catch to the very bone,

43:31.343 --> 43:33.911
and we try not to
want and waste.

43:41.554 --> 43:43.954
IRIQTAQ: We decided to
make a fire up here.

43:43.989 --> 43:45.756
TINMIAQ: It's a really
nice day, you know.

43:45.791 --> 43:47.591
IRIQTAQ: It's great
to be outdoors.

43:47.626 --> 43:50.928
We can make dinner out here
and bring it home cooked.

43:51.430 --> 43:52.963
What are you crying for?

43:52.998 --> 43:54.698
AGNES: Let him get used
to the environment.

43:54.733 --> 43:56.033
IRIQTAQ: Yeah.

43:56.068 --> 43:58.168
You grow up, you need to
be used of being outdoors.

43:58.204 --> 44:00.804
You can't just
let 'em be 10 years
old and then say hey,

44:00.839 --> 44:03.273
get the (bleep) out there
and go catch me a rabbit.

44:03.576 --> 44:06.343
You know, you gotta
start 'em from a young age.

44:07.279 --> 44:10.013
AGNES: So, right now
I just wanna get, uh,
my grandson comfortable

44:10.316 --> 44:12.449
and it's always good
to have a nice, um,

44:12.484 --> 44:15.586
skin to sit around, 'cause
it's just nothing but snow.

44:16.155 --> 44:17.654
There ya go!

44:17.690 --> 44:18.889
Watch out.

44:18.924 --> 44:20.357
I'm gonna make this
one ready to cook.

44:20.392 --> 44:21.758
If you guys wanna
start a fire.

44:21.794 --> 44:24.061
The boy at least taste
one of these rabbits,

44:24.096 --> 44:26.263
so he have an idea
what we're up to, and,

44:26.298 --> 44:29.066
um, it's just real
nice day out anyways
and the baby's never

44:29.101 --> 44:30.968
eaten rabbit before.

44:31.003 --> 44:34.838
So, this is the best place
to have a rabbit dinner.

44:38.644 --> 44:39.810
Check this out, girls.

44:39.845 --> 44:41.178
This is how you do it.

44:41.213 --> 44:44.982
All you do is just
get the bottom off and
you just peel it off.

44:45.017 --> 44:46.083
Look at that meat.

44:46.118 --> 44:47.684
CAROL: Wow. That looks nice.

44:47.720 --> 44:48.785
AGNES: Yeah.

44:48.821 --> 44:50.587
CAROL: Healthy little rabbit.

44:50.623 --> 44:53.123
AGNES: Um, all I need to do
now is just cut these feet off
and the head and take the guts

44:53.158 --> 44:56.593
out and gotta just get cooked.

44:57.096 --> 45:02.867
This is a real safe, simple
hunt, especially for kids to
get used of being out here.

45:02.902 --> 45:04.368
This is the way I
grew up, like setting
snares, small game.,ook.

45:04.404 --> 45:05.836
TINMIAQ: Haven't eaten
a rabbit in a while.

45:05.872 --> 45:09.407
Haven't really been
rabbits much lately, huh?

45:10.577 --> 45:12.310
AGNES: Check this
little bunny out.

45:12.345 --> 45:13.444
Yum.

45:13.479 --> 45:15.046
TINMIAQ: Delicious.

45:15.081 --> 45:16.781
AGNES: Could you pass me
a stick and I'll just put
it over the fire for now?

45:16.816 --> 45:19.984
This is the way to do it.

45:23.089 --> 45:24.855
It's rabbit!

45:24.891 --> 45:26.824
Look baby, you get
the first piece!

45:26.859 --> 45:28.426
TINMIAQ: Hmm.

45:28.461 --> 45:30.361
AGNES: Ana take all
the hairs and stuff off.

45:30.396 --> 45:32.096
It's num, num.
It's warm, even.

45:32.164 --> 45:33.531
It's perfect!

45:33.566 --> 45:35.199
This is a pretty good meal.

45:35.234 --> 45:36.801
We pretty much got
everything we wanted.

45:36.836 --> 45:38.369
He's happy?

45:38.404 --> 45:40.037
Yum, yum?

45:40.073 --> 45:42.673
TINMIAQ: Couple years and
he'll go set his own snares and
bring us rabbits for dinner.

45:42.709 --> 45:44.842
AGNES: Yay!
