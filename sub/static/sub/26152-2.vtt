Whether we do it our way or Vic's way,

30:49.100 --> 30:50.180
she's gonna be fine, right?

30:50.180 --> 30:52.140
-Did you see the way my dad was acting back at the bar?

30:54.030 --> 30:55.100
In all the scrapes over the years,

30:55.100 --> 30:57.100
I've never seen him like that. He looked scared.

30:57.100 --> 31:00.020
-The heart is a cruel master, son.

31:00.020 --> 31:01.190
-What is that supposed to mean?

31:01.190 --> 31:03.090
-Listen.

31:03.090 --> 31:04.210
It's no secret that your old man

31:04.210 --> 31:06.120
ain't afraid of a little tear up.

31:06.120 --> 31:08.000
Trust me, he's pulled me into a few

31:08.000 --> 31:10.170
during our 15-year stretch,

31:10.170 --> 31:13.040
but to the best of my recollection,

31:13.040 --> 31:14.200
he's never had his dear Lily put on the line

31:14.200 --> 31:16.200
like this before.

31:16.200 --> 31:18.180
And nothing's gonna cut deeper into a man

31:18.180 --> 31:21.030
than thinking that the ones he loves the most are in danger.

31:22.060 --> 31:23.220
-Charlie: He's never been in love, Henry.

31:23.220 --> 31:26.030
Well, Albert Hill has always been a cynic of romance.

31:26.030 --> 31:27.220
-Yeah, from what I've seen, love turns you blind.

31:28.110 --> 31:29.140
-Yeah, well,

31:30.060 --> 31:32.030
you'll lose your nut over some bird one day,

31:32.030 --> 31:33.150
and then we'll all be trouble, won't we, eh?

31:34.100 --> 31:35.190
-Well, at this rate it doesn't look like

31:35.190 --> 31:37.050
I'll be around long enough to find out.

31:46.200 --> 31:48.060
-Shit, there's no signal.

31:48.060 --> 31:49.160
-Well, move around. Try and get one.

31:52.210 --> 31:53.230
-Fuck.

31:53.230 --> 31:55.090
Maybe a text message will go through.

31:55.090 --> 31:56.080
-Try, try, try, try.

31:56.080 --> 31:57.140
-Fuck, I don't know Billy's number.

31:57.140 --> 31:58.230
-You don't know your boyfriend's number?

31:58.230 --> 32:01.010
-Ex-boyfriend. And why would I memorize his number

32:01.010 --> 32:02.050
when it's saved in my phone?

32:02.050 --> 32:03.110
-What is wrong with your generation?

32:03.110 --> 32:05.140
You just take away your phones and you completely fall apart.

32:05.140 --> 32:07.110
-All right, your insights aren't exactly helping.

32:08.220 --> 32:10.030
-Maybe Vic's phone number...

32:12.130 --> 32:13.140
-Okay.

32:14.150 --> 32:16.020

32:39.000 --> 32:40.110
and God knows how many more inside.

32:42.140 --> 32:45.000
-We ain't gonna be any wiser chatting the breeze out here, son, are we?

32:45.000 --> 32:47.050
