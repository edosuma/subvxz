You want to sleep
with Mommy tonight?

00:54.520 --> 00:56.568

not to kick me?

I promise.
Yeah, okay.

Shall I sing to you? Yeah.

01:06.680 --> 01:08.523
Yeah?
Mm-hm.

01:08.600 --> 01:10.364
What song?

01:10.440 --> 01:12.568
One of your songs.

01:12.640 --> 01:17.168
Oh, well, sugar, those aren't really
meant to put people to sleep.

01:19.040 --> 01:21.281
What did you sing me
when I was little?

01:21.360 --> 01:24.364
Um, like, you know,
Rock-a-bye Baby.

01:24.480 --> 01:26.244

03:56.400 --> 03:59.131

I'm jealous?

04:11.880 --> 04:13.644
There's your tip.
Thanks.

04:13.720 --> 04:16.610
You're welcome.
Goodnight.

I've-I've done

04:40.520 --> 04:42.329
Okay?

04:42.400 --> 04:44.971

some pizza?

05:09.680 --> 05:11.808

Mm. Nice.

05:17.160 --> 05:19.242
Tic-tac-toe.
Look, I won.

05:19.320 --> 05:22.005
Come on, Maisie,
you didn't let me play.

05:22.080 --> 05:23.650
Look at me.

05:23.760 --> 05:25.888
You're cheating.

05:25.960 --> 05:27.928
Maisie,

05:28.000 --> 05:31.288
do you ever wonder what
Margo thinks of us

05:31.360 --> 05:34.045
behind that
hauntingly calm exterior.

05:37.800 --> 05:40.565
Okay. Enjoy-

05:40.640 --> 05:42.369

Hi.

Susanna.

07:30.880 --> 07:32.962

07:33.040 --> 07:35.247
Shh, go back to sleep.

- Susanna.

08:04.280 --> 08:06.203
Open the door.

08:09.080 --> 08:10.320
No.

08:10.400 --> 08:12.562
Open the fucking door.

08:12.640 --> 08:15.246
Not this time. I told you it
would happen if you left.

08:15.320 --> 08:17.049
What?
Are you serious?

08:17.120 --> 08:18.963
Yes, I'm serious.
It's my apartment.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.690
- Open the goddamn door.
- No.

08:22.400 --> 08:24.801
- You're a fucking headcase.
- Fuck you!

09:09.200 --> 09:11.885
Now, remember your

not soaked.

You father's here.

09:28.320 --> 09:30.163

I don't have a dog.

You're never
going to lose money

on ar..
unless you overpay.

09:44.200 --> 09:45.964
This is a good price.

09:46.040 --> 09:49.010
I need to know if you
want the paintings,

09:49.080 --> 09:51.731
<i>I need to know ASAP.
Let me just get rid of this call.</i>

09:51.800 --> 09:53.039
One second.

09:53.040 --> 09:55.249
Here is this
month's schedule.

09:55.320 --> 09:57.482
We would prefer if you'd
wait the few extra minutes

09:57.560 --> 09:59.164
until the end
of the school day

09:59.240 --> 10:00.844
so that we don't have
to interrupt class.

10:00.920 --> 10:02.729
Okay. Okay,
I'll make sure

10:02.800 --> 10:05.087
<i>that absolutely
doesn't happen again-</i>

10:05.160 --> 10:08.209
Listen, why don't you and me go and
get ourselves a nice double espresso?

10:08.280 --> 10:10.044
With Mommy?

10:10.120 --> 10:12.168
No, no, just you and me this time.
Eh? Fun, huh?

10:12.240 --> 10:14.447
Hey, so they're
exemplary pieces.

10:14.520 --> 10:17.524
Are you kidding me?
What were you going to do?
Take her to Argentina?

10:17.600 --> 10:20.843
I'll call you back. People, just
do I need to get some help?

10:20.920 --> 10:23.810
No. This is not a game, Beale.
Come on, baby.

10:23.880 --> 10:26.201
Daddy's not going
to pick you up anymore.

10:26.280 --> 10:28.328
I'm just going to pick you up, okay?
Are you okay?

10:28.440 --> 10:30.602
It's okay.
I'm only her father.

10:35.400 --> 10:37.004
Wow, Pooh, you have
your own TV?

10:37.080 --> 10:39.367
<i>Yeah, we can
watch it later.</i>

10:39.440 --> 10:40.680
Hey, cool.
A little monkey.

10:40.760 --> 10:42.444
What a lovely room.
Thanks.

10:42.520 --> 10:43.965
Need anything
before I go?

10:44.120 --> 10:46.805
<i>No, I'm all set, thanks-</i>

10:46.880 --> 10:50.965
Zoey, I want you to listen to Maisie's
mother, otherwise I'm going to come back

10:51.040 --> 10:53.042
and there's not going to be
a sleepover, all right?

10:53.160 --> 10:55.925
- Okay
- Look

10:59.080 --> 11:01.811
Okay, on the crown.

11:01.880 --> 11:04.963

You got it?

11:05.040 --> 11:06.724
You got the icing?

11:06.800 --> 11:09.167
Candy.
Oh, candy.

11:09.240 --> 11:10.651
Wooo!

11:12.760 --> 11:14.569
<i>- Look at that slide.
- Slow move</i>

11:18.880 --> 11:20.644
Now put the...

11:20.720 --> 11:22.449
fourth one on me.

11:33.040 --> 11:35.122
Oops, sorry.

11:51.120 --> 11:53.726
Look. It's red,
white, and green.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.131
Wow.

11:55.200 --> 11:56.565
Let's go back inside.

12:01.560 --> 12:04.166
Hey, listen to this.
You guys hear that?

12:04.240 --> 12:06.242
I really love how he weighs
back on the beat.

12:06.320 --> 12:08.163
Yeah, just want
to get down.

12:08.240 --> 12:09.844
That's you.

12:09.960 --> 12:12.611
Yeah, yeah, it's good. Yeah.

13:49.640 --> 13:52.769

testifying for me.

13:52.840 --> 13:55.127

13:55.200 --> 13:57.521

a total Nazi anyway.

14:06.320 --> 14:08.209
Okay, Maisie,
come on, which one?

14:09.720 --> 14:10.846
That one.

14:12.840 --> 14:15.320
<i>You dressed yet?</i>

Put these on.

14:23.520 --> 14:24.851
Okay.

14:26.680 --> 14:29.126
You can definitely mention
the time he threw you.

14:29.200 --> 14:30.884
- He did?
- Oh, my God, yeah.

14:30.960 --> 14:32.644
He threw you
across the room

14:32.720 --> 14:34.961
onto the couch and
then yelling in your face.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.088
Jesus.
Don't you remember?

14:37.160 --> 14:40.243
It was like your most
earth-shattering moment.

14:47.600 --> 14:50.331
Maisie?

14:50.400 --> 14:53.324
Do you and your mom
sing together sometimes?

14:53.400 --> 14:55.243
Sometimes.

14:55.020 --> 14:56.731
Is it fun?

be sure to factor in thirty
years of substance abuse.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.681

- Uh-huh.

15:43.760 --> 15:45.603
Okay. Might be
a little bit spicy.

15:59.920 --> 16:01.843

Here you go.

16:39.400 --> 16:42.404

some Mandarin chicken?

16:42.520 --> 16:44.921
Mm, that sounds good.

things and then we'll, uh,

we'll keep this

Okay.

17:01.680 --> 17:03.967
Okay, I got to dash.

17:04.040 --> 17:07.169
But don't worry.
I'm fixing things, okay?

17:08.599 --> 17:10.045
And, uh,
thank you.

17:10.119 --> 17:11.929
You're one

17:18.119 --> 17:19.804
Okay, thanks.
You're a prince.

17:19.880 --> 17:22.690
That's Byron downstairs.
She's on her way up.

17:31.960 --> 17:34.247
Hey, up, up, up.
Come on.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.482
The doors don't open
until ten after eight.

My mum says you're
supposed to come with me.

18:23.440 --> 18:27.081
To your house? No, we're
going to walk you home.

18:37.440 --> 18:38.646
Bye.
Bye.

18:46.120 --> 18:47.531
Hi, Maisie.

- Really?
- Yes, yes.

19:03.340 --> 19:04.359
I know you.

19:04.360 --> 19:07.840
No, you don't know
anyone except yourself.

<i>- You breathe pain wherever you go.

19:16.520 --> 19:18.343
<i>Then why are they not
giving you sole custody?</i>

19:18.420 --> 19:20.727
<i>Because you got a female
judge, that's why.</i>

19:20.800 --> 19:23.087
If that's what you want to
tell yourself, then fine.

19:23.160 --> 19:26.004
<i>- Don't take her, man.
- I'm not taking her.</i>

19:26.120 --> 19:28.646
- Don't take her.
- I'm not taking her.
They gave her to me.

19:32.680 --> 19:34.409
<i>Hey.
Hey, baby.</i>

19:34.480 --> 19:36.209
Just the person
we want to see.

19:38.080 --> 19:40.686
Honey, why don't you get
some clothes and things

19:40.760 --> 19:42.285
and stuff
to take with us?

19:46.080 --> 19:48.208
Just do it.

19:49.640 --> 19:52.086
It's okay.
It's okay.

19:52.160 --> 19:56.609
She doesn't need you telling her
what I say is okay, asshole!

19:56.680 --> 19:59.001
Temper, temper.

20:19.960 --> 20:22.042
There you go.

20:33.680 --> 20:35.603
I'm right behind you.

20:47.280 --> 20:50.602
Hi, Maisie.
Hi.

20:51.800 --> 20:53.609
Can I take
your bag?

21:07.800 --> 21:09.609
You want to see
your room?

21:31.560 --> 21:34.370
So, what do you think?

21:43.720 --> 21:46.246
You know, you have
Margo to thank

21:46.320 --> 21:49.927
for... most
of the stuff.

21:50.000 --> 21:54.005
Why don't I let you two catch
up on the world events?

22:10.320 --> 22:12.209
So,

22:12.280 --> 22:14.521
you surprised
to see me?

22:16.840 --> 22:18.604
It's kind
of funny, huh?

22:24.080 --> 22:26.321
Hello. Hello.

22:26.400 --> 22:29.643
Hello. Hello.

22:29.720 --> 22:31.882
How much?

22:31.960 --> 22:36.443
That's academic. Look, no one
in America has heard of him.

22:36.520 --> 22:38.170
I don't know why but--

22:38.240 --> 22:39.924
Fine, okay,
let's see.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.764
Okay, bye.

22:41.880 --> 22:44.929
You can write
in straight lines.

22:46.120 --> 22:48.088
You got it.

22:48.160 --> 22:52.961
I may need to take off to
Italy in the next few weeks.

22:53.040 --> 22:55.088
Oh.

22:55.160 --> 22:58.528
So, you think you could,
uh, keep an eye on Maisie?

22:58.600 --> 23:02.571
Okay, sure.

23:02.640 --> 23:05.803
Go on, start again. You know you're only
supposed to do the first letter, right?

23:05.880 --> 23:08.884
Your passport
is in order, right?

23:09.000 --> 23:11.367
- Mine?
- Uh-huh.

23:11.440 --> 23:12.851
Uh-huh.

23:12.920 --> 23:15.321
Good. Yeah.

23:15.400 --> 23:17.607
Because this work should
only take a few days.

23:17.680 --> 23:20.365
I thought after that maybe we
could go on a little cruise

23:20.440 --> 23:23.171
<i>in the Aeolian Islands,</i>

23:23.240 --> 23:26.164
you know, say
something like that.

23:26.240 --> 23:29.722
Yeah. I've never been to Italy.

23:29.800 --> 23:31.006
Oh.

23:31.080 --> 23:32.684
Or on a boat.

23:32.760 --> 23:35.525
Right, great. Well,
then, that's good.

23:35.640 --> 23:38.803
We'll do that. We're
going on a boat? When?

23:38.880 --> 23:42.009
Well, don't start packing
just yet, okay?

23:42.080 --> 23:43.320
It's all depending.

24:00.320 --> 24:02.721
What's all this?

24:02.800 --> 24:04.928
I got a flower
delivery for Maisie Beale.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.082
Maisie? Oh.

24:07.160 --> 24:09.561
That's just-- This is
totally inappropriate.

24:09.640 --> 24:11.847
Give them back
to the delivery guy.

24:11.920 --> 24:13.126
<i>The guy
already left-</i>

24:14.560 --> 24:15.800
Okay, I'll take it.

25:38.920 --> 25:40.968
Ten minutes and then
homework, okay?

25:41.040 --> 25:42.690
Okay.

25:48.880 --> 25:51.326
Sweetie?

25:51.400 --> 25:52.765
What are these?

25:53.800 --> 25:55.643
I don't know.

25:55.720 --> 25:58.451
<i>But, I mean, did you
put them in there?</i>

26:05.720 --> 26:07.165
Maisie?

26:07.240 --> 26:09.129
Mommy sent them.

26:09.200 --> 26:12.170
Oh.

26:12.240 --> 26:13.924
Well, we should put them
in some water.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.606
Can't I just keep them
in the closet?

26:16.720 --> 26:18.370
Why?

26:18.440 --> 26:20.761
'Cause daddy
threw them out.

26:20.840 --> 26:22.968
Oh.

26:23.040 --> 26:25.327
He's allergic.

26:25.400 --> 26:27.129
Really?

26:29.520 --> 26:31.807
I'll tell you what.

26:31.880 --> 26:35.521
Why don't we press a few, and
then you can keep them forever?

26:35.600 --> 26:38.251
That'll be our
little secret, okay?

26:38.320 --> 26:42.644
Okay. Why don't you pick
some of your favorites?

26:42.720 --> 26:44.245
Okay.

26:44.320 --> 26:46.448
I like this one.

26:48.480 --> 26:50.847
This one. Okay, here's our book.

26:50.960 --> 26:53.531
Ana' this one.

26:53.600 --> 26:57.924
When we go back to Mommy's, can
we bring Starbrite's corral?

26:58.000 --> 27:00.924
Um, sweetie, I'm not
going with you.

27:02.360 --> 27:03.964
Oh.

27:04.040 --> 27:06.008
<i>I'll be here
when you gel' beck-</i>

27:06.080 --> 27:08.845
<i>Okay</i>

27:08.920 --> 27:11.400
So, where do we put the flowers?
In the middle?

27:11.480 --> 27:13.562
<i>You put them
in this side-</i>

27:13.640 --> 27:18.487
Gently.

27:18.560 --> 27:22.360
You now, your daddy's sad
when you're not here, right?

27:24.200 --> 27:26.407
So, um,

27:26.480 --> 27:28.801
it's nice for him
to have someone around

27:28.880 --> 27:31.929
to... cheer him up.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.049
And do the shopping
and everything, too.

27:35.120 --> 27:37.930
So, since
we like each other,

27:38.000 --> 27:41.368
we thought that maybe
I could do that.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.082
How does that sound?

27:49.840 --> 27:52.081
Good.

27:56.320 --> 27:58.163
Let's do another.
Okay.

27:58.280 --> 28:00.442
I think the roses
would be too big.

28:00.520 --> 28:03.649
Yeah.
That one's nice.

28:03.720 --> 28:04.767
Try that one.

28:12.800 --> 28:15.451
Oh, my baby,
I missed you so much.

28:15.520 --> 28:17.124
I missed you, too.

28:17.200 --> 28:18.804
Look.

28:18.880 --> 28:21.281
Jesus.

28:21.360 --> 28:23.328
Jesus, how
did that happen?

28:23.400 --> 28:25.448
I touched my arm
on the stove

28:25.520 --> 28:27.284
and I got burned
and I cried.

28:27.360 --> 28:29.124
I bet you did.

28:29.200 --> 28:32.044
I bet that hurt.

28:32.120 --> 28:36.125
How did it happen? Did Daddy let
you cook by yourself or something?

28:37.960 --> 28:41.601
Oh, God.
Okay.

28:41.680 --> 28:43.887
The court says that I'm not
supposed to say anything,

28:43.960 --> 28:47.169
but I would be, like, totally
negligent if I didn't tell you

28:47.240 --> 28:48.890
that you really
have to watch yourself

28:48.960 --> 28:50.610
when you're alone
with Daddy, okay?

28:50.680 --> 28:52.250
Margo was there.

28:52.320 --> 28:54.368
Margo?
You mean,

28:54.440 --> 28:56.010
you mean our Margo?

28:56.080 --> 28:58.606
Margo who was at our house?
That Margo?

29:04.040 --> 29:06.327
You have a nice
room at Daddy's?

29:06.400 --> 29:08.528
Uh-huh, I have
a canopy bed.

29:08.640 --> 29:12.008
Oh, that's nice.

29:12.080 --> 29:15.163
Does Margo have
a nice room?

29:15.240 --> 29:18.767
It's tiny, and when you look out
the window, there's a wall.

29:18.840 --> 29:22.447
Ooh, daddy must not like her very much
if he gives her a room like that.

29:23.600 --> 29:25.045
He likes her.

29:25.120 --> 29:27.885
Yeah?

29:27.960 --> 29:30.645
Does he-- Does he
give her a kiss?

29:30.720 --> 29:33.007
Anything like that? Show
her how much he likes her?

29:35.240 --> 29:38.210
I don't know.
No?

29:38.280 --> 29:39.691
No, huh?

29:42.000 --> 29:45.925
Yes, yes, I'm sure. She just told me.
Hang on a second.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.048
Hey, baby, go play in your
room for a little bit.

29:48.120 --> 29:50.521
I'm going to finish
this phone call, okay?

29:50.640 --> 29:53.883
No, he's got her
living with him.

29:53.960 --> 29:57.009
What do you think I want? I want you
to take that asshole back to court

29:57.080 --> 29:59.082
and get me
sole custody.

30:10.480 --> 30:11.811
Maisie?

30:15.880 --> 30:17.723
Careful, Maisie.

30:33.800 --> 30:35.450
Why would you be
afraid of her?

30:35.560 --> 30:37.927
I mean, fine, maybe she
looks a little funny,

30:38.000 --> 30:40.844
but that's, like,
really narrow minded.

30:40.920 --> 30:42.888
I don't want you to grow up
to be one of those people

30:42.960 --> 30:45.531
'cause it's just
not cool.

30:45.600 --> 30:48.410
Ana' you know what? She's the kind
of nanny you're supposed to have.

30:48.480 --> 30:50.881
I mean, she's not some tramp
with a daddy fixation.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.607
She smells funny. She
does not smell funny.

30:54.680 --> 30:56.648
That's the way a nanny
is supposed to smell.

30:56.720 --> 30:57.721
Come on.

30:57.800 --> 30:59.609
Okay, let's go.

31:10.200 --> 31:12.407
Come on, Maisie,
let's go.

31:12.480 --> 31:13.925
<i>Get your stuff, sweetie-</i>

31:18.280 --> 31:20.089
Hey, turn around.

31:20.200 --> 31:21.884
You're going to see him soon enough.
I will?

31:22.000 --> 31:23.968
You're going to be a flower girl.
I am?

31:24.040 --> 31:26.407
Yeah, there's nothing
he won't do.

31:26.480 --> 31:29.643
Here comes
the fucking bride.

31:43.560 --> 31:46.370
The collar is sticking
up a little bit there.

31:46.440 --> 31:48.647
Yeah, good.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.209
Mrs. Beale, this is Principal
Fairchild- Teffenbaum.

32:25.280 --> 32:28.204
This is my third message. I
would appreciate a call back.

32:28.280 --> 32:29.805
Thank you.

32:29.880 --> 32:32.884
Maisie, are you sure
your mother knows

32:32.960 --> 32:34.564
she's supposed
to pick you up?

32:34.680 --> 32:36.682
I don't know.
All right.

32:36.760 --> 32:38.171
I'll figure
something out.

32:41.800 --> 32:44.804
Oh, Mais.

32:44.880 --> 32:48.168
I thought that Maisie's mother was
supposed to be doing pick up today.

32:48.240 --> 32:50.925
She is. If my husband hadn't checked
his messages at the airport,

32:51.000 --> 32:54.800
we'd be on a plane. I'm
supposed to be on my honeymoon.

32:54.880 --> 32:58.089
Hey, excuse me.
Is this, uh--

32:58.160 --> 33:01.130
Susanna Nun. She sent
me to get her daughter.

33:01.200 --> 33:02.690
Who are you?

33:02.760 --> 33:05.570
Uh, I'm her, uh,

33:05.640 --> 33:07.483
sort of like
Maisie's stepfather.

33:07.560 --> 33:11.645
You're what? Yeah, I'm
married to Susanna.

33:15.160 --> 33:17.367
Hey.

33:17.440 --> 33:19.602
How-how are you, Maisie?
I'm Lincoln.

33:19.680 --> 33:23.082
Do you remember me? We met
before a few weeks ago.

33:23.160 --> 33:25.561
Remember that?
This is--

33:25.640 --> 33:28.723
We don't just release children to
anyone walking into the office.

33:28.800 --> 33:32.407
Um, no, of course, no.

33:37.720 --> 33:39.768
So, I've got Maisie, and
I don't know what to do,

33:39.840 --> 33:41.888
so can you please
call me back?

33:43.240 --> 33:45.004
I can't get
hold of him.

33:45.080 --> 33:47.048
Would you want
to call Susanna?

33:47.120 --> 33:49.202
Just if you want to make
sure I'm not some random--

33:49.280 --> 33:51.203
I'm not going
to call Susanna.

33:51.280 --> 33:53.169
Why don't you call her?

33:53.240 --> 33:56.050
Yeah. Yeah, sure. I can call.

34:00.400 --> 34:01.640
Hey, it's me.

34:01.720 --> 34:03.563
Yeah, no,
it's good.

34:03.640 --> 34:05.483
I'm outside the school
here with Maisie,

34:05.560 --> 34:08.166
and Margo is here.

34:08.239 --> 34:10.129
I understand.

34:10.199 --> 34:12.248
Yeah, well, she doesn't
really know who I am.

34:12.360 --> 34:14.761
Yeah, all right.
Just one second.

34:14.840 --> 34:17.446
Uh, it's Susanna.

34:17.520 --> 34:18.806
Hello?

34:20.600 --> 34:22.648
Yes.

34:22.719 --> 34:24.449
I heard you.

34:27.199 --> 34:29.168
Okay, so I'll just
take Maisie--

34:29.239 --> 34:30.650
He-hello?

34:30.719 --> 34:33.087
Susanna?
Hello?

34:35.520 --> 34:37.123
Okay.

34:39.480 --> 34:42.051
Uh, I guess
that's done.

34:42.120 --> 34:43.724
Yeah, I guess.

34:43.800 --> 34:45.085
I've got to go.

34:45.159 --> 34:46.400
You need a cab?
Yeah.

34:46.520 --> 34:48.806
I'll get you one.

34:48.880 --> 34:50.768
Hey, taxi.

34:53.600 --> 34:55.170
Hi.

34:56.840 --> 34:58.569
Okay, Maisie, I'll
see you in ten days.

34:58.640 --> 35:00.802
I don't want you to go.

35:00.880 --> 35:03.201
It'll be okay, okay?

35:03.280 --> 35:05.362
I promise.

35:05.440 --> 35:06.930
I have to go.

35:07.040 --> 35:08.769
I don't want
to go with him.

35:08.840 --> 35:10.842
Oh, Maisie.

35:10.960 --> 35:14.521
I really, really love you. Okay?

35:14.600 --> 35:16.011
Okay.

35:16.080 --> 35:18.082
See you
in ten days, okay?

35:18.160 --> 35:19.446
Bye, sweetie.

35:19.520 --> 35:21.568
Have a nice honeymoon.

35:21.680 --> 35:23.523
Bye, Maisie.

35:23.640 --> 35:25.722
Please say bye.

35:31.120 --> 35:33.043
JFK, please.

35:50.600 --> 35:53.171
Yeah, we should
probably wait.

36:37.200 --> 36:38.964
<i>She's lost if-</i>

36:39.040 --> 36:41.566
No, we need some more.

36:41.640 --> 36:44.120
<i>Oh, I'll be back-
Baby just came home-</i>

36:47.760 --> 36:49.728
I have to kiss you.

36:54.520 --> 36:56.648
Mommy?
Yeah?

36:56.720 --> 36:59.121
Did you really
get married?

36:59.200 --> 37:02.682
Uh-huh. But I still
love you the best.

37:02.760 --> 37:06.162
And I'm still
your mommy, right?

37:06.240 --> 37:09.483
And, you know, he's just-he's
just like a friend.

37:09.560 --> 37:11.483
You don't have to call
him Daddy or anything.

37:11.560 --> 37:16.088
Just like-just like you don't
call Margo mommy, right?

37:17.480 --> 37:18.925
You can just
call him Lincoln.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.480
Did you have
a flower girl?

37:23.560 --> 37:27.121
Oh, you know what? If we
did, it would've been you.

37:27.200 --> 37:29.487
But we kept it
really low key,

37:29.600 --> 37:33.844
and, um, it was just like with a
Justice of the Peace kind of thing.

37:33.920 --> 37:35.126
We didn't even
have a cake.

37:35.200 --> 37:37.441
No cake?
No cake.

37:37.520 --> 37:39.488
Sad but true.

37:39.560 --> 37:42.086
Here, want
to see something?

37:42.160 --> 37:44.527
You want to see what he gave me?
Look at this.

37:44.600 --> 37:46.807
Look at that.
It's tiny.

37:46.880 --> 37:48.370
It is tiny, isn't it?

37:48.440 --> 37:50.761
Tiny, tiny,
little one.

37:52.560 --> 37:53.561
Hey.

37:53.680 --> 37:55.409
Hey.
Sorry.

37:55.480 --> 37:57.369
It's okay.
Come on in.

37:57.440 --> 37:59.727
I got to go
to work actually.

37:59.800 --> 38:01.484
Okay.

38:01.560 --> 38:03.642
It was nice
seeing you again, Maisie.

38:03.760 --> 38:05.524
Say goodbye
to Lincoln.

38:05.600 --> 38:08.171
Bye.
Bye.

38:08.240 --> 38:10.447
How tall he is.
He's so tall.

38:12.040 --> 38:14.611
Doe she always work at night?
Yeah.

38:14.680 --> 38:17.160
He's pretty much just a bartender,
but you know, whatever.

38:17.240 --> 38:19.971
It's good, so when I'm
working, he can watch you.

38:20.040 --> 38:21.883
It's going to be good.

38:23.360 --> 38:25.442
Can I tell you
a secret?

38:25.520 --> 38:28.603
I married him for you.

38:35.560 --> 38:37.562
I married him for you.

a couple more,

39:36.560 --> 39:38.722

It's beautiful.

40:05.760 --> 40:07.524
You're really good.

40:07.600 --> 40:11.366
I don't know how to make
one of those... bridges.

40:11.440 --> 40:13.568
Like a drawbridge?

40:13.680 --> 40:16.490
Well, just, um,

40:16.600 --> 40:18.602
if you make
the doorway here

40:18.680 --> 40:22.127
and then like the bridge going
down and then some chains.

40:22.200 --> 40:24.601
That's it.
With a moat.

40:27.360 --> 40:29.169
I can't do it.

40:31.320 --> 40:32.481
You do it.

40:32.560 --> 40:34.483
But it's your drawing.

40:37.680 --> 40:40.251
Really? Okay.

40:40.320 --> 40:43.210
Maybe you can draw
some animals in the moat,

40:43.280 --> 40:45.487
some dangerous animals so
people can't swim across.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.408
Crocodiles and some
polar bears

40:51.480 --> 40:53.482
and stuff
that will eat you.

40:53.560 --> 40:55.528
Okay.

40:55.640 --> 41:00.328
I haven't used a crayon in a
really, really long time.

41:00.400 --> 41:03.085
When I was a kid, I read
this story about a family,

41:03.160 --> 41:05.322
and their car
broke down in the desert.

41:05.480 --> 41:08.563
And do-do you know how
they survived? How?

41:08.640 --> 41:11.291
They ate crayons
and paste.

41:11.400 --> 41:13.846
It sounded
pretty good to me.

41:13.920 --> 41:17.891
I used to sneak paste to eat
when I was a kid.

42:55.080 --> 42:57.048
Hey. What are you
still doing here?

43:00.320 --> 43:04.245
Um, OK-- Le-let's go.
Let's go and check.

43:07.400 --> 43:11.121
No, no, he didn't forget.
He knows it's his pick up day.

43:11.200 --> 43:13.362
Honeymoon my ass.
He's messing with me.

43:13.440 --> 43:15.841
<i>Look, it's a violation
of the court order,</i>

43:15.920 --> 43:18.844
and he agreed to those
dates before he left.

43:18.920 --> 43:22.322
You got
to be kidding me.

43:22.400 --> 43:25.006
Great, okay.

43:25.120 --> 43:28.761
So, he says it's a violation
of the court order

43:28.840 --> 43:31.127
for them to not
let us pick her up.

43:31.200 --> 43:35.683
<i>But if they don't pick her up,
it's not a violation, okay?</i>

43:35.800 --> 43:37.609
He knows it's
his pick up day.

43:37.760 --> 43:40.206
Maybe--
What, what, what?

43:40.280 --> 43:42.806
We could go back to the court again.
No, no.

43:42.880 --> 43:45.201
I'm not subjecting
myself to that bullshit.

43:45.280 --> 43:46.930
Where are
my cigarettes?

43:47.000 --> 43:48.809
Jesus.

43:50.640 --> 43:53.291
A witch hunt,
that's what it is.

43:56.200 --> 43:58.806
Hey, are you hungry?

44:06.840 --> 44:09.605
Do you get to make all
the food for everyone?

44:09.680 --> 44:11.569
Uh, no.

44:11.640 --> 44:14.325
I'm just-I'm just
a bartender.

44:16.360 --> 44:18.522
Do you get
lots of money?

44:18.600 --> 44:20.807
Well, I get tips.

44:20.880 --> 44:23.963
But not lots of money.
I wouldn't say that, no.

44:24.040 --> 44:27.044
Do you think it's important
to make lots of money?

44:27.120 --> 44:29.043
Uh-huh.
How come?

44:29.160 --> 44:34.121
So you can be rich. Oh, of
course, so you can be rich.

44:34.200 --> 44:36.885
What if you like doing something
where you don't make lots of money?

44:37.000 --> 44:39.526
Like what?
Like being a teacher.

44:39.600 --> 44:41.648
Or maybe you want
to be a nurse.

44:41.720 --> 44:44.963
Or a fireman.
Or a bartender.

44:45.040 --> 44:47.247
Yeah, or a bartender.

44:48.720 --> 44:50.165
For now.

44:50.240 --> 44:51.890
Here we go.

44:52.000 --> 44:53.684
Bon appétit.

44:55.640 --> 44:57.688
I thought you said
you liked eggs.

44:59.160 --> 45:01.527
I don't want
to ruin it.

45:06.040 --> 45:08.441
Okay, see you later.

45:08.520 --> 45:10.682
You're supposed
to walk me in.

45:10.760 --> 45:12.728
Are you sure
we don't say bye here?

45:14.200 --> 45:15.690
Really?

45:15.760 --> 45:18.127
Okay.

45:18.200 --> 45:21.124
Maisie has something she'd
like to share with the class.

45:21.200 --> 45:23.328
This is my new
stepfather.

45:23.400 --> 45:25.129
Hi.

45:25.240 --> 45:26.969
My father
married my nanny,

45:27.040 --> 45:29.771
so court made my mommy
get married, too.

45:32.400 --> 45:35.165
Tyler.
I've two stepfathers.

45:35.240 --> 45:37.481
But one
is almost dead.

45:43.040 --> 45:48.490
"And most castles had 50
rooms and were in England.

45:48.560 --> 45:51.848
<i>"If someone hurt an
animal or tried to be rich,</i>

45:51.920 --> 45:55.845
they would be killed
and put in jail.

45:55.920 --> 45:58.491
A lot of people in jail
hurt their-selves

45:58.560 --> 46:02.042
so that they could go to
the hospital and have food.

46:02.120 --> 46:06.842
They ate stale bread, and then
gave the bread to the homeless.

46:06.920 --> 46:10.845
The end. Life in a Castle
by Maisie Elizabeth Beale.

46:10.920 --> 46:13.082
Wow.

46:13.160 --> 46:15.447
That's amazing.

46:16.720 --> 46:19.724
What am I, invisible?

46:19.800 --> 46:22.804
You know, you don't get a bonus for
making her fall in love with you.

46:25.240 --> 46:27.481
Hey, baby, why don't you go to
your room for a little while

46:27.560 --> 46:29.801
so Lincoln and I
can talk, okay?

46:34.400 --> 46:37.563
Dude, how am / supposed to go away
on to work and leave her with you

46:37.640 --> 46:39.847
<i>when you're full
of shit?</i>

46:39.920 --> 46:41.843
What are you talking about?
Ana' when did this tour come?

46:41.920 --> 46:43.365
You deliberately
undermine me.

47:10.360 --> 47:13.330
Why does everything have
to be such a nightmare?

47:15.040 --> 47:18.840
You know, I've turned
into this like petty--

47:18.920 --> 47:21.844
I don't recognize
myself anymore.

47:21.920 --> 47:26.084
You know, baby, all I wanted was for
him to make things easier for us.

47:32.040 --> 47:34.202
Your story
is very cool.

47:35.600 --> 47:37.364
Thank you.

47:38.840 --> 47:40.205
Hey.

47:44.200 --> 47:46.009
What are you
thinking about?

47:46.080 --> 47:48.367
Nothing.

47:48.440 --> 47:50.044
No?

47:53.920 --> 47:57.129
You want to come to
work with me tomorrow?

47:57.200 --> 48:00.283
Maybe you could help me pick
out my costumes for the tour.

48:00.360 --> 48:02.408
Would you like that?

48:16.000 --> 48:18.446
Your dad's an asshole.
He really is.

48:18.520 --> 48:23.048
First he disappears, and then
he shows up out of nowhere.

48:23.120 --> 48:25.566
I don't know
how to deal with this.

48:30.600 --> 48:32.762
I really don't.

48:35.080 --> 48:37.128
Baby, I got
to lie down.

48:44.080 --> 48:47.129
Lincoln,
Beale's downstairs.

48:52.400 --> 48:54.323
Hey.

48:54.400 --> 48:55.765
Come here.

48:55.840 --> 48:58.923
Whoa. You missed me? Uh-huh.

48:59.040 --> 49:01.520
Yeah, we were wondering when we
were going to see you again.

49:01.600 --> 49:03.807
You're the husband?
Yeah.

49:03.880 --> 49:06.121
It's-it's
the new husband.

49:06.240 --> 49:08.481
My name is Lincoln. It's Beale.
Pleased to meet you.

49:08.560 --> 49:11.484
Nice to meet you.

49:11.560 --> 49:13.927
I'd give you a couple of pointers
but I doubt that the, uh,

49:14.000 --> 49:17.049
Jacoby and tragedy
that was our relationship

49:17.120 --> 49:20.169
would apply to the farce that
you two guys are playing out.

49:20.280 --> 49:21.850
Okay- Okay-

49:21.920 --> 49:23.809
Anyway, good luck
Yeah.

49:23.920 --> 49:25.365
Bye, Maisie.
Whoa.

49:26.760 --> 49:28.205
Bye.

49:28.280 --> 49:29.850
Thank you.

49:38.280 --> 49:40.681

49:40.760 --> 49:44.162

49:53.440 --> 49:54.771
Fine.

49:54.840 --> 49:56.171
Happy?

49:56.240 --> 49:57.480
Uh-huh.

50:15.000 --> 50:18.243
A word that
sounds like owl?

50:18.320 --> 50:19.970
- Tyler.
- Clown.

50:20.040 --> 50:22.168
<i>Clown. Excellent.

Maisie.
Sound.

50:26.160 --> 50:27.241
Sound. Good.

50:50.520 --> 50:52.090
Which is
your favorite?

50:52.160 --> 50:55.084
I like the blue one.

51:06.080 --> 51:08.606
<i>It's getting late, Maisie.
We should go.</i>

51:12.280 --> 51:14.647
Are we still going
on a boat with Daddy?

51:14.720 --> 51:16.609
What boat, sweetie?

51:16.680 --> 51:19.445
In Italy,
like he said.

51:19.520 --> 51:21.966
Um, I don't know.
Maybe.

51:22.040 --> 51:24.168
Are you and Daddy
still married?

51:24.240 --> 51:25.844
Of course.

51:25.920 --> 51:28.207
It's not like pretend?

51:28.280 --> 51:30.248
No. Why would you ask that?

51:31.560 --> 51:33.005
I don't know.

51:34.760 --> 51:36.285
Oh, Mais.

51:43.320 --> 51:45.004
Come on, Beale,

51:44.720 --> 51:46.849
You didn't even tell us
you were leaving.

51:46.920 --> 51:48.729
First, we were going
to be coming with you,

51:48.800 --> 51:51.531
and then it was only going
to be for a few days.

51:51.600 --> 51:53.887
When are you
coming back?

51:53.960 --> 51:56.122
What do you mean
you don't know?

51:56.200 --> 51:57.611
Hold on.

51:59.440 --> 52:01.249
What are you
doing up?

52:01.320 --> 52:03.527
Does your throat
still hurt?

52:05.160 --> 52:07.731
It's not time
for your medicine, yet.

52:07.800 --> 52:10.280
I'm talking to your
father in London.

52:10.360 --> 52:13.887
Can I talk to him?

52:13.960 --> 52:15.689
Here's Maisie.

52:17.800 --> 52:19.245
Daddy?

52:19.320 --> 52:22.130
I don't feel good.

52:23.440 --> 52:25.044
No.

52:25.160 --> 52:27.288
I miss you, too.

52:28.840 --> 52:30.330
It's me.

52:32.040 --> 52:34.088
I don't know.
I told you.

52:34.160 --> 52:36.242
They were supposed to pick
her up three days ago.

52:36.320 --> 52:39.847
It would just be nice to know
when anything is going to happen

52:39.920 --> 52:41.729
about anything.

52:41.800 --> 52:43.882
<i>Okay</i>

52:43.960 --> 52:45.485
No.

52:45.560 --> 52:47.608
I should just go.

52:47.680 --> 52:50.126
Right.
Bye.

52:52.040 --> 52:54.088
I'll be right back.

52:58.200 --> 53:01.921
<i>You're three days late. It's 10:00
at night, and she's not well-</i>

53:02.000 --> 53:04.321
It's okay.
We'll take a taxi.

53:04.400 --> 53:06.971
It's not okay. She's got
a temperature of 101.

53:07.040 --> 53:08.644
It's--

53:08.720 --> 53:10.529
Hey.

53:12.840 --> 53:15.650
Oh. You're not
feeling well, are you?

53:15.720 --> 53:17.643
I have the bug.

53:17.720 --> 53:19.484
Oh, the bug.

53:19.560 --> 53:21.130
That sounds bad.

53:21.200 --> 53:24.010
- Why didn't you come?
- I'm sorry.

53:24.080 --> 53:26.731
There was this whole
mix up and--

53:26.800 --> 53:29.770
Well, kind like
three mix ups actually.

53:29.840 --> 53:32.764
I have to take my
medicine in an hour.

53:32.840 --> 53:35.002
Okay-
Okay-

53:37.560 --> 53:38.925
So, what do you
want me to do?

53:39.000 --> 53:40.525
Susanna is going
to kill me.

53:40.640 --> 53:43.086
Come back in a day or two.
A day or--

53:43.160 --> 53:45.288
I can't come back
tonight without her.

53:45.360 --> 53:47.169
Susanna is going
on four this weekend.

53:47.240 --> 53:51.245
Lincoln, she's a child.
She's not well.

54:06.920 --> 54:08.809
I'll see you
in a couple of days.

54:08.880 --> 54:10.484
Okay?

54:14.240 --> 54:17.210
Get some rest,
so you feel better, okay?

54:28.760 --> 54:29.921
Goodnight.

54:39.080 --> 54:40.730
That one.

54:40.800 --> 54:42.245
Good choice.

54:50.120 --> 54:52.043
Hey.
Mommy.

54:54.520 --> 54:56.045
No, we need some of--

55:02.160 --> 55:03.889
Baby, let me
show you this bus.

55:03.960 --> 55:05.485
It's good, huh?

55:05.560 --> 55:07.881
You got ice-cream.
You got chocolate.

55:07.960 --> 55:09.325
You want one
of these?

55:13.440 --> 55:16.011
Hang on tight. You got it?
I got it.

55:16.080 --> 55:17.605
Cool.

55:17.680 --> 55:19.364
I-I can't talk
right now.

55:19.440 --> 55:21.249
Good, here we go.

55:22.440 --> 55:24.329
Here we go, baby.

55:29.880 --> 55:31.769
I can't see anything.

55:38.840 --> 55:41.525
One, two,
three, cheese.

55:44.640 --> 55:46.881
Hey, baby, look,
there's Lincoln.

55:50.480 --> 55:52.209
Come on, let's go.

55:55.440 --> 55:57.761
It sucks that we don't
have more time together.

55:57.840 --> 56:00.241
But you know I love you
more than anything, right?

56:00.320 --> 56:01.810
Okay?

56:01.920 --> 56:02.967
I do.

56:04.000 --> 56:05.081
Okay, go.

56:06.600 --> 56:07.840
Watch out.

56:07.920 --> 56:09.081
Okay.

56:11.200 --> 56:12.690
Okay, bye.

56:18.800 --> 56:20.643
<i>Hotel room</i>

56:20.720 --> 56:23.087
She's in the bathroom
for like 15 minutes.

56:23.160 --> 56:25.003
I'm watching television...

56:25.080 --> 56:28.323
and she comes out
of the bathroom buck naked.

56:28.400 --> 56:30.084
I'm like, okay, fine...

56:30.160 --> 56:31.491
<i>I push her up
against the glass--</i>

56:31.560 --> 56:32.846
Your order, sir.

56:35.200 --> 56:37.931
Do you want to come sit over
here instead, by the cherries?

56:38.040 --> 56:39.769
It's more fun
over there.

56:47.560 --> 56:49.085
Is it okay
if she sits here?

56:49.160 --> 56:51.640
It's fine.

56:51.760 --> 56:53.489
Check this out.

56:53.560 --> 56:55.005
Hello?

57:18.240 --> 57:19.685
Ooh!

57:19.760 --> 57:23.287
I can't hear you!

57:41.320 --> 57:42.970
It's like
you're a monkey.

57:45.320 --> 57:46.481
Oh.

57:50.160 --> 57:51.400
You got
an eye on that?

57:51.480 --> 57:52.845
Don't.
I that it?

58:09.000 --> 58:10.968
Again?

58:11.040 --> 58:13.361
Yeah, I'll try.
I'll call you back.

58:13.440 --> 58:16.762
Hey, Maisie?
Come here a minute.

58:16.840 --> 58:19.047
They called
from-from work,

58:19.120 --> 58:20.929
and someone
is sick today,

58:21.000 --> 58:23.765
so I'm going to have to
go in and work probably.

58:23.840 --> 58:26.684
I could go
with you again.

58:26.760 --> 58:28.091
No.

58:28.160 --> 58:30.128
No, we--
We can't do that.

58:30.200 --> 58:32.441
<i>It's not
a good idea-</i>

58:32.520 --> 58:34.045
Don't bite
your nails.

58:34.160 --> 58:36.083
You ate glue.
Yeah.

58:36.200 --> 58:38.282
All right, wise guy,
come on, let's go.

58:38.360 --> 58:40.203
I'm not a guy.
I'm a girl.

58:40.280 --> 58:42.282
Yeah, come on,
wise girl.

58:43.920 --> 58:45.604
What if she's not here?

58:45.680 --> 58:48.524
I don't know.

58:50.680 --> 58:52.569
Maybe Caroline
can come.

58:52.640 --> 58:54.369
No, Caroline's
got a boyfriend.

58:54.440 --> 58:58.331
Come on.

58:58.440 --> 59:02.206
Can I go to work with you then?
No, you can't.

59:03.840 --> 59:06.047
Oh, we'll-we'll figure
something out.

59:08.760 --> 59:10.683
I know it's
late over there, Beale.

59:10.760 --> 59:12.808
I've been stuck in this
hallway for an hour.

59:12.880 --> 59:15.451
Just tell the guy at the door
to come up here and let me in.

59:17.480 --> 59:19.084
Hi.

59:19.200 --> 59:20.884
What are you
doing here?

59:20.960 --> 59:23.486
Well, I-I know it hasn't
been ten days, yet.

59:23.560 --> 59:28.202
But I-- He has to go to work.

59:28.280 --> 59:32.968
Yeah. Yeah, it's, uh, you know,
things have been a little rough

59:33.040 --> 59:34.451
with her mother gone
and-and all.

59:34.520 --> 59:36.409
Right.

59:36.480 --> 59:38.847
You know, I was just thinking
like we're both in--

59:38.920 --> 59:40.968
You thought what?

59:41.040 --> 59:42.405
That I feel
sorry for you?

59:42.480 --> 59:44.801
That I've got
nothing else to do?

59:44.880 --> 59:48.043
That I'm just
that sort of person?

59:48.120 --> 59:50.441
<i>Well, I'm not,
so you deal with it..</i>

59:50.520 --> 59:51.851
It's your problem,
not mine.

59:51.920 --> 59:53.922
I didn't-I didn't
say that.

59:56.520 --> 59:59.729
I am locked out
of my own apartment

59:59.800 --> 01:00:03.361
because my husband didn't
bother put me on the lease.

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:05.681
Like I don't exist.

01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:10.451
I have done everything
I was supposed to.

01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:19.763
He can't use
people like this.

01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:22.684
I didn't
realize that--

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:25.286
I'm really sorry.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.048
Just go.

01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:38.168
Please.
Yeah.

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:43.969
Come on, Maisie.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.526
I'm sorry.

01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:09.805
You know I didn't
mean you, don't you?

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.206
Thank you.

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:18.368
<i>None of this
is your fault-</i>

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:21.410
I'll see you
later, Maisie.

01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:23.767
<i>It's not
Lincoln's fault, either.</i>

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:26.366
He's just
mixed up, too.

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:29.723
You really
like him, don't you?

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:31.609
I love him.

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:34.490
I'm sorry
I got mad at him.

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:36.927
He must think
I'm awful.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.686
Mommy gets mad
at him all the time.

01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:56.010
There he is.

01:01:58.040 --> 01:01:59.565
Hey, Maisie.

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:05.523
Hey.
Hi.

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:07.489
I did the icing
but it's from her

01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:09.767
<i>because she's sorry
she got mad at you-</i>

01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:13.361
Oh.
A cake.

01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:15.647
<i>I told her that
you like chocolate-</i>

01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:17.802
I do like chocolate.

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:20.491
Thank you.
Thank you both.

01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:26.445
Uh, you guys hungry?

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:28.568
Yeah? I know someone
who works here

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:30.364
so I might be able
to get you a table.

01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:32.363
You work here.

01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:34.681
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I do work here.

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:37.240
Uh, come on.

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:39.084
<i>You know what some
people eat here?</i>

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:43.000
- What?
- Raw hamburger
with raw eggs on it.

01:02:44.024 --> 01:02:46.084
These are for Lincoln.

01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:54.083
Would you eat a raw hamburger
with a raw egg on it?

01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:57.528
Never.
Would you?

01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:01.730
<i>Glasgow has got such
a vibe and a lot of culture-</i>

01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:04.411
It's so funny
'cause, like, to me

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:06.926
you don't have a very
thick Scottish accent

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.367
when you say Glasgow, Glasgow.
That's nice.

01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:13.081
Yeah, it is, it is.

01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:18.803
Yeah, I always wonder
if I'll be now.

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:46.122
Thank you for the
cake and tonight.

01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:47.531
Yeah.

01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:49.489
Okay.

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:50.891
Goodnight.

01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:06.249
Morning.
Morning-.

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:10.289
How did you sleep?
Good.

01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:13.603
What do you want
for breakfast?

01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:15.648
Mm, / don't know.

01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:17.609
Pancakes.

01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:20.365
<i>Okay.
Pancakes it is.</i>

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:42.645
Lincoln.

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:48.804
Sorry I'm late.

01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:51.247
The wolf
is scaring her grandma.

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:53.527
Oh, bummer.

01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:55.887
She's chasing
the wolf there.

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:02.601
Okay, higher.
Higher.

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:12.521
<i>- Don't get too close.
- There are so many.</i>

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:14.239
<i>This is really cool.</i>

01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:16.841
I can't believe
I haven't been here before.

01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:19.002
Look, see, there's
a baby turtle.

01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:20.844
Wow.

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:22.524
<i>Look at that guy.
He's checking you out-</i>

01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:25.086
So many of them.

01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:26.844
<i>This is great-</i>

01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:28.968
Yeah, I like it here.

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:30.929
You know what?
What.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.288
You could buy turtles
in the street.

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:36.886
They keep them in buckets,
and they're only $1.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.083
- Really? Wow.
- I was bitten by a turtle once.

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:42.806
- Were you really?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:45.167
<i>It even left
a scar if you"</i>

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:47.004
Big?

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:50.802
It could've left
a scar.

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:53.486
<i>- It's that bad. It could've left a scar.
- Right, yeah.</i>

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:56.086
So, is it quite traumatic for you
being here with the turtles?

01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:58.601
- This is kind like therapy for me.
- Oh, it is? Okay.

01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:00.330
Meeting the beast again.

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:05.167
That's the last one
until after dinner, okay?

01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:07.811
Daddy.

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:10.048
- We'll do this.
- Daddy!

01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:12.361
Hey, my favorite girl.

01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:14.283
Hey, you got heavy.

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:18.291
- What a surprise.
Yeah, I had a change of schedule.

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:22.810
I can smell candy.

01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:25.321
- We went to go see a puppet show.
- Did you now?

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:27.562
- Red Riding Hood.
- Oh, that's scary.

01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:29.244
I was just about
to make some dinner.

01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:31.971
Ah, not for me, thanks.
I ate on the plane.

01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:33.883
Yuck.

01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:35.291
I got a couple
of calls to make,

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:37.249
but I'll join you
guys later.

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:39.129
Come on, Maisie, we
should get washed up.

01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:29.210
Oh, hey, sweetie.

01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:32.004
Where is Margo?

01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:35.648
Pff.

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:39.406
Maybe she went
for a long walk.

01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:42.404
<i>Let's go get breakfast-</i>

01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:01.003
I, uh,

01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:03.242
I don't need to tell you
things are a bit of a mess

01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:05.687
since your mom
ran off.

01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:08.127
She's on a big tour.

01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:10.441
Not so big
from what I hear.

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:14.605
But, uh, be that
as it may,

01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:17.444
Um, I may have
to go back to England.

01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:20.966
Um, couple of, you know,
business opportunities,

01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:24.328
and your grandmother is
not getting any younger.

01:08:24.399 --> 01:08:26.607
You... you understand?

01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:30.287
Can I come? We can-we
can get the coins.

01:08:30.359 --> 01:08:32.600
Coins?
What coins?

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:36.002
Like your daddy found in the
ground when you were little.

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:40.568
You remember me
telling you that?

01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:43.325
Maybe we can find
some more.

01:08:43.399 --> 01:08:46.210
Would you like that?
Yeah? Just the two of us?

01:08:46.279 --> 01:08:48.567
You and your old man
digging for coins?

01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:51.325
I could do
with a few.

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:55.282
Why not? Your mother
would have a fit.

01:08:55.399 --> 01:08:57.845
But I don't think I'd have a
problem squaring it with the judge

01:08:57.920 --> 01:08:59.921
after she ditched
with that bartender.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.129
Sure I could settle with Margo
without any legal nonsense.

01:09:05.479 --> 01:09:06.970
Why not?

01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:10.082
Why not?
Why not?

01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:12.162
Will I get back
in time?

01:09:12.279 --> 01:09:15.568
- For what?
- To go to Mommy's.

01:09:17.479 --> 01:09:19.687
This wouldn't be a day
excursion, you know that.

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:22.406
This would be
like a permanent thing.

01:09:22.479 --> 01:09:25.450
All the time?
All the time.

01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:28.091
Maybe Mommy would like
to live there, too.

01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:29.889
No, there's
no Mommy in England.

01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:32.406
You can't--

01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:37.886
There's a whole ocean.

01:09:41.359 --> 01:09:42.964
<i>It's ...</i>

01:09:50.399 --> 01:09:52.845
You know,
England is, um--

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.083
England is pretty
cold, actually.

01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:01.128
It rains a lot.

01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:03.202
And, um,

01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:05.806
and we need to have
to rethink, you know.

01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:12.967
And you're on the fence,
I can see that.

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:15.566
I think you'd be
happier here.

01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:19.728
All the same.

01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:25.241
Um, the good news

01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:28.688
is that when I visit
America for work,

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:30.728
I can see you, too.

01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:42.730
Does your nose still make that
squeaky noise when you press it?

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:48.320
Okay. You would have laughed at
that when you were four years old.

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:50.402
<i>Don't deny it.</i>

01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:04.288
- Take care, Mr. Beale.
- Sure.

01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:10.960
Bye.

01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:13.407
Okay, bye.

01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:15.448
Have a safe trip now.

01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:27.330
Quinn, 8B.

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:29.721
Volgo, 11E.

01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:32.963
Remmy, 9C.

01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:35.566
Laporte,
penthouse.

01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:39.804
Remmy, 9C.

01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:43.043
And 1A. Laporte, penthouse.

01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:45.487
I thought your father was a way.

01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:49.724
Well, he was here when we
came from the puppets.

01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:52.007
Well, I can't really
watch you now.

01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:53.884
I got to be in Chinatown
in half an hour,

01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:55.724
and I'm sort
of late already.

01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:57.768
Is it still
Margo's week?

01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:00.525
She and daddy had a fight, and
this morning she was gone.

01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:02.090
Gone?

01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:04.208
- Where did she go?
- I don't know.

01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:05.930
But Daddy's
going to England,

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.411
and he said that
I could go with him

01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:09.528
and then he said
that I couldn't.

01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:12.888
And then we came in a
taxi and he left me here.

01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:16.601
Well, that's a lot.

01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:18.967
Okay, I'll--
Why don't--

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:22.044
I'll call Margo.
See if I can find her.

01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:25.850
It'll be okay.

01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:39.804
Oh, there she is.

01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:47.045
Hey. How are you?

01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:48.963
Thanks.

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:52.450
Thanks for coming.

01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:54.727
Yeah, of course
I came.

01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:07.130
What if they
don't have a turtle?

01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:09.487
I'm sure we'll find
one somewhere.

01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:12.370
Okay, well, actually
I have to go this way.

01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:15.091
But I'll see your turtle
when I get home, okay?

01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:18.323
Thanks for your help.
Okay, well, just call me.

01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:20.129
Mommy!

01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:22.202
Oh, my God, baby.

01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:24.282
I'm so happy
to see you.

01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:26.488
We're going
to get a turtle.

01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:28.847
A turtle?
A turtle?

01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:31.127
So, what are you two
doing with my daughter?

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:34.050
- What are you talking about?
- Looking after her while you're on tour.

01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:36.521
What are you,
like a stalker?

01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:38.881
What are you going
to stiff me next, huh?

01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:41.406
So, what are you two
doing together, huh?

01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:43.329
What am I doing?
What are you doing?

01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:44.890
What are you doing in New York?

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.162
I'm back for half a day.
Oh, yeah?

01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:49.447
Cars are coming.
Hey, hey, hey!

01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:51.727
Do you mind?
I have a kid here.

01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:53.768
What the fuck?
What are you doing?

01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:55.803
- Really, what are you doing?
- What are you doing?

01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:57.564
I'm taking my
daughter, that's what.

01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:59.449
Get out
of my face.

01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:03.366
I'll love to get
out of your face.

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:05.602
You don't deserve her.

01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:08.367
I'm done.

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:12.926
<i>Let's go get the turtle.
Let's go get it.</i>

01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:16.602
Let's go get
the turtle.

01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:27.485
Do you like it?

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:29.090
It's what you wanted, right?
Uh-huh.

01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:30.571
Yeah.

01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:42.483
What do you
want to do?

01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:44.324
Hungry or anything?

01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:46.841
You want something to eat?
No, thanks.

01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:55.329
You know, I didn't even know
we were stopping in New York.

01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:58.244
- Okay.
- Okay?

01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:01.290
Yeah?

01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:03.488
Okay.

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:07.047
This turtle is pretty
cool, you know.

01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:10.808
Want to come
to our house?

01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:14.641
Want to come
to our house, turtle?

01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:25.201
<i>No, I don't-I don't
care what you tell him-</i>

01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:27.760
Just say that I have
laryngitis or something

01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:32.323
or mercury poisoning,
all right?

01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:34.482
<i>Just get me
out of it.</i>

01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:36.483
<i>No, I'm not
leaving her.</i>

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.729
Goddamnit,
come on.

01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:41.450
What am I
supposed to do?

01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:44.330
I can't go back
on the road right now.

01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:47.370
I can't.
No, I'm not going to.

01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:51.405
Jesus, what do you
expect me to do?

01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:58.324
Hey, baby.

01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:02.200
Honey, wake up. Okay, wake up.
We got to go.

01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:04.123
It really sucks but we got to go.
Come on.

01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:10.810
Okay, baby-

01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:13.730
I am so sorry but I have...
I got to go.

01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:15.484
I just can't miss
another show right now

01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:17.562
because I'll have a
massive law suit on my hand

01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:20.564
and I just can't
handle that right now.

01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:24.002
Okay? But you know
what I'm going to do?

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:26.162
I'm going to have you full
now for a couple of shows

01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:28.129
and then we can hang
out for a while

01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:31.329
and then maybe we could
sing a duet together.

01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:35.570
Is that too phony?

01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:39.440
Okay, uh, you can hang out here with
Lincoln until he's finished work

01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:42.091
and then he's going
to take you home, okay?

01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:44.806
I love you so much.

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:46.120
I got to go, baby.

01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:49.687
Maisie.

01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:52.206
I'm going to wait
till you go inside, okay?

01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:54.123
It's all right.

01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:26.527
Hey, hon.
Remember me?

01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:29.763
Where's Lincoln?
He's not on tonight.

01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:31.729
Who are you with?

01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:34.280
My mom put me here so that
I could stay with him.

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:37.449
- Well, let me talk to your mom.
- She left.

01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:40.330
Hi, still serving?
Absolutely.

01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:43.802
<i>Um.. stay
right here, okay?</i>

01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:45.769
I'll be right back.

01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:47.410
Right this way.

01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:23.046
I'll keep making calls and
see if I can find him.

01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:25.805
- Thanks for doing this.
- No problem.
See you tomorrow.

01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:38.531
What are you doing up?

01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:40.125
Hey, kid.

01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:46.807
Where's Margo?
I want to go home.

01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:51.209
- Where's Margo?
- You're going to stay
here tonight, remember?

01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:53.442
It's going to be fine.
Let's go back to bed.

01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:57.161
- I want to go home. I want to go home.
- Come here.

01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:01.931
Please, I want
to go home.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.490
It's okay.

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:05.961
It's going to be fine.

01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:50.969
<i>- Just a couple of things, okay, sweetie?
- Okay.</i>

01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:53.168
What about
my turtle?

01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:57.722
We'll get the turtle.

01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:29.369
And you know what?

01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:33.087
What? My cousin told
me where the key is.

01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:35.328
Guess where it is? Where?

01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:38.847
It's under the mat
on the back door.

01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:40.649
You're going to be okay
with your bag?

01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:42.085
Uh-huh.

01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:00.690
Oh, God.

01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:03.411
God, don't do this.

01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:26.204
There's an upstairs.

01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:28.009
Yeah, you want
to go see?

01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:06.365
It's cold.

01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:07.805
Feels good.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.570
Look.

01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:29.324
What if someone buys the house?
Where would we go?

01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:31.442
It doesn't happen
that fast.

01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:33.124
What if we had
to go somewhere else?

01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:34.884
How would people know
where we are?

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.082
We tell them. What if
we couldn't find them?

01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:39.811
We'd find them
and we'd tell them.

01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:43.327
Anyway, I told them where we were
so they wouldn't be worried.

01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:45.846
Dinner's ready.

01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:52.441
What do you think
this should be?

01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:54.921
- Probably a window.
- A window?

01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:02.324
Hey, Maisie.
Come on.

01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:04.209
Okay, let's go
to the beach.

01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:09.446
- Can you hear the ocean?
- Shh.

01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:11.329
Yes.
You can?

01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:13.885
Wow.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.968
Okay.
Two pails.

01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:19.405
Two pails?

01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:21.050
Let's trade.

01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:23.241
There you go.

01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:32.169
Lincoln!

01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:36.170
Lincoln!

01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:37.287
Hey.

01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:40.525
Hey.

01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:44.164
How are you?

01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:46.004
Want to see
my room?

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:48.651
Yeah. Yeah, I'd love
to see your room.

01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:50.848
Of course.
Of course.

01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:52.610
I'd love to see your room. Hey.

01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:56.243
Hey.

01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:00.930
I'm sorry.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.606
It's not working again.

01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:07.447
It's not working again.

01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:22.363
<i>Yeah, I got it.</i>

01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:24.807
There's a place in the back
where we can get worms.

01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:27.724
And we can go on the boat
next door whenever we want.

01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:29.962
Oh, wow.
Perfect.

01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:33.527
We can go tomorrow if you want to.
Lincoln just got here.

01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:36.962
- How long are you staying?
- Well, definitely long
enough to go on the boat.

01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:39.646
It's beautiful here.

01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:45.483
Uh, I brought you something from
the city I thought you might like.

01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:51.449
Wait, I'll
show you something.

01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:55.161
There's a picture that I
thought might be interesting.

01:25:56.640 --> 01:25:58.290
Look at that.
Look.

01:25:58.360 --> 01:25:59.930
- You know why?
- Why?

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.048
I was thinking we
might want this guy.

01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:04.088
We can put him
in our moat.

01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:06.322
In our moat, that was what
I was thinking. Perfect.

01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:08.283
- You guys have a moat?
- Of course.

01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:10.362
<i>Okay.</i>

01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:24.000
What's that?
Look at that.

01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:25.929
- Do you want to pick it up?
- Look at that, Maisie.

01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:29.328
- Gently, gently.
- It's holding onto the rock.

01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:31.402
Look, he's moving.

01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:33.687
He's moving.

01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:38.047
He's waving at you.

01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:40.606
- You're going to hold my hand?
- Yeah.

01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:42.603
Okay. Don't stand on him.

01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:44.523
Could we go
on the boat tomorrow?

01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:46.762
Why don't you ask the
fishermen when they get back?

01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:49.923
Hold on. Hold on.

01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:01.960
He said we
could go tomorrow!

01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:06.928
One, two three, four,
five, six, seven.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.446
I want to buy it.

01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:11.648
You already have it.

01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:13.609
I want to buy a hotel.
Can I have two?

01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:15.364
Yeah.

01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:17.363
Fifty?

01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:20.569
Are you kidding me?
You can't even buy a hostel.

01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:22.722
You got to do better than that.
Give me a little more.

01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:25.047
Two hotels you got to pay.
Give me, uh--

01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:29.444
Oh, how generous of you. You don't
even get a sleeping bag for that.

01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:33.206
We weren't allowed to play
Monopoly when I was a kid.

01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:36.688
- What did you play instead?
- This Swiss doctor made some games.

01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:39.206
They're supposed to instill
cooperation and pacifism.

01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:42.767
- That's probably why you're losing.
- Yeah. Ha, ha, ha.

01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:46.444
In my house, it was
every man for himself.

01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:48.284
Oh, thanks
for the warning.

01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:51.768
- What's funny?
- You are.

01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:54.281
Yeah, you are. You are so funny.
You are so funny.

01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:56.522
Thank you.
Okay.

01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:58.762
- No.
- Go to jail.

01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:03.689
Oh, come on.
I need some luck now.

01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:08.162
It's not fair.

01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:44.847
Surprise.

01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:47.808
Ah, Oh.

01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:51.965
Oh, my little
beach bunny.

01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:55.965
Hey, guess what? I'm playing
Virginia Beach tomorrow night.

01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:58.281
I found this really
nice girl with a dog

01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:00.328
who can watch you
during the show.

01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:03.802
And then after that we go to
North Carolina and Tennessee.

01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:07.129
- Why kind of a dog?
- I don't know.

01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:09.407
But, um, it's kind
of a long drive,

01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:12.086
so if you want to say goodbye to
these guys, you'd better hurry up.

01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:14.851
Okay, go ahead.
Go on.

01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:20.043
Or you can just come back to
the bus and we can take off

01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:22.361
and you can open all the
presents I got you.

01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:26.084
You want to do that?

01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:29.926
I want to meet the dog
but maybe the day after.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.970
Well, baby, the day after I'm
playing Raleigh, so I got to go.

01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:36.601
Okay, come on. Come on, let's go, babe.
Come on, come on.

01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:39.924
What's up? What's the matter?
Come on.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.162
We're supposed to go
on a boat tomorrow.

01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:44.720
Baby, we can go on a boat any day, okay?
It's not a big deal.

01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:46.609
We got to go.
Come on, let's go.

01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:49.047
Come on.
Come on.

01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:51.805
Maisie, come on.

01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:54.201
Don't' you want to come?

01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:08.002
Fine.

01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:10.970
Why did I
fucking bother?

01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:13.771
<i>God, what is if? You just decided
you don't like me anymore?</i>

01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:15.524
Is that it?

01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:19.683
What, are you
scared of me?

01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:34.764
Oh, shit.

01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:43.130
I'm sorry, baby.
I'm so sorry.

01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:46.603
I don't want you
to be scared.

01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:49.725
I'm an idiot,
you know.

01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:52.491
I'm, um--

01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:55.803
Hey, Maisie, Maisie,
baby, you know what?

01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:58.486
I really love you.

01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:01.086
I really do.

01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:04.562
<i>Before you were born, I didn't
know if was possible to love somebody</i>

01:31:04.640 --> 01:31:06.210
<i>as much as I love you.</i>

01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:09.284
You're just like my,
my little baby.

01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:12.369
Can I tell you something?

01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:17.964
A long time ago
I was just like you.

01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:23.329
I was just like you.

01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:28.647
You want to go
on a boat tomorrow?

01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:38.130
You want... to stay
with them for a while?

01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:52.527
You know who
your mother is, right?

01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:55.365
You.

01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:21.644
Let's go open
your presents.

01:32:23.240 --> 01:32:24.685
Come on.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.207
<i>All right, you got to tell
me how big you want it.</i>

01:33:17.320 --> 01:33:18.765
That's good.

01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:20.490
- That's good?
- That's good.

01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:22.085
Do you know
where the filters are?

01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:24.521
Um, on the table.

01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:26.489
<i>Look at that
little baby pancake-</i>

01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:28.124
That's tiny.
I want a big pancake.

01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:29.640
Shall we do
another one?

01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:31.762
- You ready?
- I want a big one.

01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:35.009
- You want a big one?
This one's very big.
- Okay, good.

01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:34.048
Come on, hurry up.
