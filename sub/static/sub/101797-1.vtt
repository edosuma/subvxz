WEBVTT

00:57.725 --> 00:59.727
Repent, brother.

00:59.761 --> 01:01.195
Accept Allah's word

01:01.228 --> 01:03.631
and proclaim Muhammad
as his messenger.

01:10.270 --> 01:12.239
Should've spoken to you more
about martyrdom.

01:12.272 --> 01:14.509
If I had, you'd be laughing
at these fuckers.

01:14.542 --> 01:18.111
You'd be saying, "Through you,
I gain entrance into paradise."

01:21.583 --> 01:23.618
We're not afraid to die.

01:24.786 --> 01:27.689
That's why we're gonna win.

01:30.492 --> 01:32.594
I'm not afraid, either.

01:34.194 --> 01:36.531
Do your job.

04:00.475 --> 04:02.443
Doug's here.

04:11.753 --> 04:13.788
- Hey, don't forget this.
- Oh.

04:13.821 --> 04:16.924
- Gosh, thank you, Janet.
- Have fun.

04:16.958 --> 04:18.793
Thanks.

04:32.774 --> 04:34.575
<i>Guess what I got her.</i>

04:34.609 --> 04:35.977
Not a burka.

04:36.010 --> 04:37.412
Now, that would be funny.

04:37.445 --> 04:38.913
No.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.982
A sexy gold anklet

04:41.015 --> 04:44.786
and some belly-dancing lessons.

04:44.819 --> 04:46.421
Oh, you didn't.

04:46.454 --> 04:47.455
It's a joke.

04:47.488 --> 04:48.956
He's gonna kill her.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.492
It's not for him.

04:51.526 --> 04:54.394
Anyway, he's supposed to be
an American now.

04:54.429 --> 04:56.396
There's got to be
a sense of humor

04:56.431 --> 04:58.231
buried under that beard
somewhere.

04:58.265 --> 05:00.367
You talking about him or me?

05:11.446 --> 05:12.914
Whoa. - LIZ: Watch out!

05:12.947 --> 05:15.382
- Geez.
- Christ.

05:15.416 --> 05:17.250
What the hell?

05:17.284 --> 05:19.352
Oh, my God.

05:23.658 --> 05:25.358
Excuse me.

05:25.392 --> 05:27.628
That was a little reckless,
don't you think?

05:27.662 --> 05:28.863
And?

05:28.896 --> 05:30.531
That's a Maserati GranTurismo.

05:30.565 --> 05:32.365
Asshole.

05:32.399 --> 05:34.469
If I had that,
people would like me.

05:34.502 --> 05:35.503
<i>Ha!</i>

05:35.536 --> 05:37.605
Infidels. You're late.

05:37.638 --> 05:38.840
Javid.

05:38.873 --> 05:40.508
How have you been,
my infidel friend?

05:40.541 --> 05:41.943
- How are you, Javid?
- Is Liz too busy

05:41.976 --> 05:43.544
fighting the war on terror,
you can't come

05:43.578 --> 05:44.579
to Meena's graduation on time?

05:44.612 --> 05:45.813
Oh, knock it off, Javid.

05:45.847 --> 05:47.415
- I do trade policy.
- No, no, no, no.

05:47.448 --> 05:49.817
You're a spy,
and everybody here knows

05:49.851 --> 05:51.384
you're a spy, so...
and it's fine.

05:51.419 --> 05:52.987
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.556
There she is,
the most beautiful graduate.

05:55.590 --> 05:57.992
Thank you for coming.
Thank you so much.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.994
That's for you. Congratulations.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.796
Oh, my God, that's so sweet.

06:01.829 --> 06:03.396
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

06:03.431 --> 06:05.767
Open it later. It's girl stuff.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.602
- Shh.
- Oh, I get it.

06:07.635 --> 06:10.938
Well, he has his secrets,
and we have ours.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.610
Wow. Congratulations.

06:17.344 --> 06:18.980
- Oh, am I sitting here?
- Doug, my brother,

06:19.013 --> 06:21.682
it's such an honor
to speak at Al-Azhar.

06:21.716 --> 06:22.850
What did I tell you, huh?

06:22.884 --> 06:24.317
I told you the blog post
would get

06:24.351 --> 06:25.052
a positive reaction
in the Middle East.

06:25.086 --> 06:26.020
Huh? What did I say?

06:26.053 --> 06:27.889
Oh, you-you told me.

06:27.922 --> 06:29.690
Thank you. And, Liz,

06:29.724 --> 06:32.794
everyone is extremely proud
of your husband here.

06:32.827 --> 06:34.695
Such an honor he has received.

06:34.729 --> 06:36.631
So he must go to Cairo, okay?

06:36.664 --> 06:37.932
Yeah, he must.

06:37.965 --> 06:39.066
See, guys?

06:39.100 --> 06:42.369
Faith is what unites us.

06:42.403 --> 06:44.872
- That's right.
- And this is what Doug's post is about.

06:44.906 --> 06:50.044
And you would understand if you
went with him to church, huh?

06:50.077 --> 06:51.746
Mm-hmm.

06:51.779 --> 06:55.883
Javid, you know, you can always
go to church with me, too.

06:55.917 --> 06:58.019
Yeah, right.

06:58.052 --> 07:00.087
Of course. That's a good one.

07:00.121 --> 07:02.456
Funny fellow here, huh?

07:03.758 --> 07:04.859
Very funny.

07:04.892 --> 07:05.960
What?

07:05.993 --> 07:07.595
Who's the young guy over there?

07:08.996 --> 07:11.566
- The one with the tattoos?
- Yeah.

07:11.599 --> 07:13.100
He wants to date Meena.

07:13.134 --> 07:15.002
Can you believe such a thing?

07:15.036 --> 07:17.738
Look, I seriously would not
let him in my house.

07:17.772 --> 07:19.440
Never mind.

07:19.473 --> 07:21.042
There.

07:22.910 --> 07:25.012
Thank you for coming, seriously.

07:25.046 --> 07:27.415
- You're welcome.
- Means a lot.

07:27.448 --> 07:29.016
Okay, everyone.

07:30.885 --> 07:32.987
I would like to make a toast.

07:33.020 --> 07:35.890
With water and soda only, okay?

07:35.923 --> 07:37.558
Except for those infidels.
I see you.

07:37.592 --> 07:39.660
You're drinking alcohol.

07:40.695 --> 07:43.164
To my daughter, Meena.

07:43.197 --> 07:46.000
May Allah guide your future path

07:46.033 --> 07:50.104
in our beautiful,
adopted America.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.106
<i>Beh salamati, Meena.</i>

07:52.139 --> 07:53.407
<i>Beh salamati.</i>

07:53.441 --> 07:54.742
Cheers, guys.

07:54.775 --> 07:56.444
Have a seat.

07:56.477 --> 07:58.646
Food time.

07:58.679 --> 08:01.115
- Yes, yes!
- I'm starving.

09:02.276 --> 09:05.479
"Doug, my very good
infidel friend.

09:05.513 --> 09:08.849
You're such an infidel,
but I tolerate you."

09:08.883 --> 09:10.785
You never liked him much anyway.

09:10.818 --> 09:12.920
But I love his daughter.

09:12.954 --> 09:14.622
And her mother.

09:14.655 --> 09:16.524
She plays a dutiful Muslim wife...

09:16.557 --> 09:20.061
don't you think?... but she's
got fire and resilience in her.

09:20.094 --> 09:22.763
You'd have to
to put up with that bullshit.

09:22.797 --> 09:24.231
It's a software company.

09:24.265 --> 09:26.767
And Javid's the only guy
at work I can talk to

09:26.801 --> 09:29.270
about international events,
politics.

09:29.303 --> 09:31.205
Everybody else is
just a bunch of geeks

09:31.238 --> 09:33.841
who want to talk...

09:33.874 --> 09:35.676
software.

09:35.710 --> 09:36.944
Yeah, he's fine.

09:36.978 --> 09:38.813
He's just always playing
the big shot.

09:38.846 --> 09:41.649
- He's so over the top.
- Mm-hmm.

09:46.988 --> 09:49.090
Hello?

09:49.123 --> 09:51.092
Hello. Is anyone there?

09:51.125 --> 09:52.693
Liz?

09:52.727 --> 09:54.829
Soheila?

09:54.862 --> 09:57.131
Is Meena there?

09:57.164 --> 09:59.734
Meena here? No. Why?

09:59.767 --> 10:01.202
She left the party
with her boyfriend.

10:01.235 --> 10:03.904
He was supposed to
drop her off hours ago.

10:03.938 --> 10:05.773
- I'm worried, Liz.
- You're worried.

10:05.806 --> 10:09.610
I want to call the police,
but Javid won't let me.

10:09.643 --> 10:11.212
Well, you know, he probably

10:11.245 --> 10:13.214
just wants to give it
a bit more time.

10:13.247 --> 10:15.082
It's, uh...
it's graduation, Soheila.

10:15.116 --> 10:16.317
It's, you know...

10:16.350 --> 10:18.085
They party. They celebrate.

10:18.119 --> 10:19.987
It's a big night.

10:20.021 --> 10:21.155
- Give it a chance, yeah?
- Okay.

10:21.188 --> 10:23.824
Okay. Night. Bye.

10:25.092 --> 10:26.894
Welcome to America.

10:28.662 --> 10:30.865
Graduation.

10:46.280 --> 10:47.948
Javid?

10:47.982 --> 10:49.750
Shut up, Soheila!

12:37.057 --> 12:38.659
Hello?

12:39.461 --> 12:41.195
Soheila?

12:42.129 --> 12:44.165
Uh, I will. I will.

12:44.198 --> 12:46.300
Something's not right.

12:46.333 --> 12:48.903
What is it?

12:50.237 --> 12:52.474
We called 911.

12:52.507 --> 12:54.442
They're expecting you, sir.

12:55.376 --> 12:56.877
- Hi. Excuse me.
- Hi.

12:56.911 --> 12:58.179
You Javid's friend?

12:58.212 --> 12:59.280
- Yes.
- Come on in.

12:59.313 --> 13:00.881
Stay here.

13:00.915 --> 13:02.983
- You work with Javid, right?
- Mm-hmm.

13:03.017 --> 13:04.285
I'm glad you're here.

13:04.318 --> 13:05.786
You're gonna witness
how my client's rights

13:05.819 --> 13:07.388
- are being violated.
- This is my home!

13:07.422 --> 13:09.023
- A good Muslim home!
- It's good you're here.

13:09.056 --> 13:11.459
- Hey, Javid.
- Doug.

13:13.194 --> 13:14.361
It's okay.

13:14.395 --> 13:15.763
Look at what they're doing, man,

13:15.796 --> 13:17.064
just, like, treating us
like criminals.

13:17.097 --> 13:18.332
Mr. Rawlins?

13:18.365 --> 13:20.067
- Yes.
- I'm Sergeant Knebel, Fairfax Police.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.936
Yeah, this man is my friend.

13:21.969 --> 13:24.305
- He knows me, and he will tell you the truth.
- That's great.

13:24.338 --> 13:26.508
Can you tell your client
to back off, please?

13:26.541 --> 13:28.342
Can I talk to you
for a second, please?

13:28.375 --> 13:30.077
Give me a second.

13:30.110 --> 13:31.979
- Have you seen Mr. Hosseini's daughter?
- Wait here.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.781
- Uh, earlier this evening...
- Don't answer that.

13:33.814 --> 13:35.049
It's immaterial.

13:35.082 --> 13:36.418
Meena's not here.

13:36.451 --> 13:37.952
You don't know
where she is, right?

13:37.985 --> 13:39.954
- Neither do the Hosseinis.
- Excuse me.

13:39.987 --> 13:43.190
Your presence here
is entirely unwarranted.

13:43.224 --> 13:44.925
No one here called you.

13:44.959 --> 13:47.394
The man's Muslim, so you enter
his house without a warrant,

13:47.429 --> 13:48.896
- without permission.
- Can you please take her?

13:48.929 --> 13:50.231
- Thank you.
- Islamophobia.

13:50.264 --> 13:52.500
You better not lay a hand on me.

13:52.534 --> 13:54.368
Where is your warrant?

13:54.402 --> 13:56.136
Do not touch me.

13:56.170 --> 13:57.871
Soheila.

14:01.275 --> 14:02.977
She let us in.

14:03.010 --> 14:05.246
Look, um...

14:05.279 --> 14:06.914
these are good people.

14:06.947 --> 14:10.050
I've known Mr. Hosseini
for some time now.

14:10.084 --> 14:11.453
Have you ever seen him exhibit

14:11.486 --> 14:13.320
extremist behaviors
or attitudes?

14:13.354 --> 14:15.222
What?

14:15.256 --> 14:16.924
No.

14:17.925 --> 14:19.860
Come with me.

14:21.262 --> 14:23.030
Come on.

14:29.870 --> 14:32.840
I've read your blog, by the way.

14:32.873 --> 14:34.308
Good stuff.

14:34.341 --> 14:36.343
Thanks.

14:57.998 --> 15:00.334
Recruitment videos.

15:01.436 --> 15:03.237
Beheadings.

15:03.270 --> 15:05.839
Islamic rah-rah shit.

15:06.608 --> 15:08.976
He's running
a terrorist nerve center

15:09.009 --> 15:10.311
or recruitment website.

15:10.344 --> 15:13.380
Or am I just an Islamophobe?

15:13.415 --> 15:14.982
I'm going in there.

15:15.015 --> 15:17.151
You don't have the right
to restrain me.

15:17.184 --> 15:20.187
Excuse me. I am his lawyer.
Now, let me through.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.856
Fruit of
the poisoned vine, my friend.

15:22.890 --> 15:26.528
You have no legal right
to be here.

15:26.561 --> 15:29.163
Everything in this room
is inadmissible.

15:29.196 --> 15:30.532
Go ahead. Keep going.

15:30.565 --> 15:32.534
Mr. Rawlins, I'm so sorry.

15:32.567 --> 15:35.069
I'm sure you're aware,
this is a gross violation

15:35.102 --> 15:38.473
of your friend Mr. Hosseini's
Fourth Amendment rights.

15:38.506 --> 15:41.909
Mr. Rawlins? Mr. Rawlins?

15:49.451 --> 15:51.218
- Get in the car.
- Did you see Meena?

15:51.251 --> 15:52.554
No.

15:52.587 --> 15:54.188
Is she still missing?

15:54.221 --> 15:56.624
Get in the car, Liz.

16:16.043 --> 16:18.580
My Uber's outside, honey.

16:18.613 --> 16:21.215
I'm leaving, Liz.

16:21.248 --> 16:22.684
What's this?

16:22.717 --> 16:26.086
Knocking-around shoes
with a twist.

16:27.522 --> 16:29.123
See this?

16:30.391 --> 16:32.059
You type your message...

16:32.092 --> 16:34.462
an e-mail, text, tweet,
whatever, okay?

16:34.496 --> 16:36.964
- Mm-hmm.
- Type your secret message.

16:36.997 --> 16:39.266
Then you put this in the drive.
See it highlight?

16:39.299 --> 16:41.235
- Mm-hmm.
- Then you delete it.

16:41.268 --> 16:44.338
Now you write something
mundane, something like:

16:44.371 --> 16:45.973
"Awfully sticky here in Cairo."

16:46.006 --> 16:48.075
Listen to this. It's important.

16:49.309 --> 16:50.944
- Then you press "send."
- Okay.

16:50.978 --> 16:53.615
To the rest of the world,
anyone who is trying to hack

16:53.648 --> 16:55.617
into your messages,
they will read the mundane.

16:55.650 --> 16:59.521
But from my end,
I can read your invisible text.

16:59.554 --> 17:02.122
Okay? By accessing it
with my own drive.

17:07.027 --> 17:09.129
So this is what you do
at the State Department.

17:09.163 --> 17:12.366
- Mm-hmm.
- Who gave it to you? Samantha?

17:13.768 --> 17:15.437
- Take it, please.
- No.

17:15.470 --> 17:17.439
Take it.

17:18.372 --> 17:21.208
You know, she's the one
that's got you paranoid.

17:21.241 --> 17:23.645
Travel to Egypt
by high-profile Christians

17:23.678 --> 17:25.112
is especially risky now.

17:25.145 --> 17:26.681
That is the latest
travel warning.

17:26.714 --> 17:28.683
So I'll be low-profile.

17:28.716 --> 17:30.984
- Low to the ground. I mean...
- Bullshit.

17:31.018 --> 17:33.987
You're a featured guest
at an international conference.

17:34.021 --> 17:36.658
- Come on.
- Is it that important?

17:36.691 --> 17:39.293
Wh-Why were you invited?

17:39.326 --> 17:40.360
I don't know.

17:40.394 --> 17:41.629
Okay.

17:41.663 --> 17:43.197
This is how
you'll come off in Cairo:

17:43.230 --> 17:45.733
a vanilla Christian,
ticket to Heaven punched,

17:45.767 --> 17:48.670
with a big smile showing
how close you are to Jesus.

17:48.703 --> 17:51.506
I am close to him.
Sorry that bothers you.

17:51.539 --> 17:53.140
And if only those poor,
lost Muslims

17:53.173 --> 17:55.777
could feel as happy inside
as you are.

17:55.810 --> 17:58.979
You are so beautiful.
How'd you get so cynical?

18:00.815 --> 18:03.150
I just keep thinking,

18:03.183 --> 18:05.152
if we had a kid...

18:05.185 --> 18:08.021
if we had a family,
you wouldn't be

18:08.055 --> 18:11.225
running around the world
playing the holy apostle.

18:12.660 --> 18:16.196
You'd have a reason
to stay home.

18:17.799 --> 18:22.537
Now you're making this into
a much bigger deal than it is.

18:23.738 --> 18:25.573
They don't answer their phone.

18:25.607 --> 18:26.808
Their daughter's missing.

18:26.841 --> 18:29.309
Javid is supposed to be
your friend.

18:29.343 --> 18:32.312
He's supposedly your friend.

18:32.346 --> 18:34.014
Supposedly.

18:35.015 --> 18:39.052
As I've told you,
he won't talk to me anymore.

18:39.086 --> 18:41.221
He knows what I saw
in that room.

18:41.255 --> 18:43.257
Okay, and what
does that tell you?

18:43.290 --> 18:45.560
He is the one that said,
"Go to Cairo.

18:45.593 --> 18:46.694
Talk about the faith."

18:46.728 --> 18:48.796
You're not suspicious?

18:48.830 --> 18:51.666
I was played, okay?

18:51.699 --> 18:53.735
I have to go.

18:53.768 --> 18:56.604
Whatever you do, don't preach.

18:59.474 --> 19:02.109
It's just who I am.

19:03.545 --> 19:05.279
And I love you.

19:05.312 --> 19:07.247
Okay, don't go. I'm asking you.

19:07.281 --> 19:09.082
Don't go. Don't go.

19:09.116 --> 19:10.250
I will call you.

19:10.284 --> 19:11.519
Bye.

19:44.552 --> 19:46.320
Liz.

19:48.923 --> 19:50.458
Liz!

19:53.428 --> 19:55.162
Liz!

20:30.898 --> 20:33.434
I'm never gonna set foot
in church again.

20:33.468 --> 20:35.369
I don't want to see
those people.

20:35.403 --> 20:37.772
Forget about those people.
Forget them.

20:38.606 --> 20:40.642
Liz, I see him in you.

20:40.675 --> 20:42.644
There's nothing in me.

20:48.750 --> 20:50.852
I lost my last chance
at having a kid.

20:50.885 --> 20:53.421
We both did.

20:54.889 --> 20:56.824
Understand this.

20:58.559 --> 21:00.795
I'm done with God.

21:03.431 --> 21:05.767
And if you want to stay
married to me, understand this:

21:05.800 --> 21:07.367
I'm done with God.

21:11.673 --> 21:13.875
He's done with me.

21:31.759 --> 21:33.260
<i>Well, thank you very much.</i>

21:33.293 --> 21:34.862
<i>I am so honored to be invited o</i>

21:34.896 --> 21:39.534
<i>Al-Azhar University of Cairo,
Islam's seat of learning.</i>

21:39.567 --> 21:41.703
<i>Not to talk about
what divides us</i>

21:41.736 --> 21:43.538
<i>but what unites us.</i>

21:43.571 --> 21:46.007
<i>We are
so honored to have you here.</i>

21:46.040 --> 21:48.643
I have been following your blog,

21:48.676 --> 21:50.611
your writings.

21:50.645 --> 21:52.947
You are amazing.
I am a huge fan.

21:52.980 --> 21:55.382
You are here because you are

21:55.416 --> 21:59.721
a man willing to speak honestly
about faith.

21:59.754 --> 22:03.658
And I want you to talk to us
tonight about Jesus

22:03.691 --> 22:06.527
and help us build bridges.

22:06.561 --> 22:09.362
Well, thank you, Mustafa.

22:10.531 --> 22:12.365
Um...

22:12.399 --> 22:15.603
you know, the media,
the pundits, the dividers,

22:15.636 --> 22:19.272
they tell us we're engaged
in a clash of civilizations

22:19.306 --> 22:21.676
- between Islam and the West.
- Yeah.

22:21.709 --> 22:23.511
That we're at war.

22:23.544 --> 22:24.879
But I beg to differ.

22:24.912 --> 22:28.015
The real clash is between
the Abrahamic religions

22:28.049 --> 22:30.485
and modern secularism.

22:30.518 --> 22:34.522
It's the secularists
that fear and hate us.

22:34.555 --> 22:37.759
It is the secularists...
they preach the loudest

22:37.792 --> 22:39.727
against religion.

22:39.761 --> 22:41.429
So true. So true.

22:41.462 --> 22:45.032
People say we Muslims
are living in the Dark Ages.

22:45.066 --> 22:47.468
But the Dark Ages
weren't dark in Islam.

22:47.502 --> 22:51.606
In the 1500s,
Islam was the richest,

22:51.639 --> 22:54.542
most learned civilization
in the world.

22:54.575 --> 22:57.512
And today,
we embrace technology,

22:57.545 --> 23:00.782
modern advancements,
as you can see.

23:00.815 --> 23:02.683
Westernization, no.

23:02.717 --> 23:04.719
Modernization, yes.

23:04.752 --> 23:06.754
Mm-hmm. Well...

23:09.657 --> 23:12.760
But, cultural differences aside,

23:12.794 --> 23:15.496
I'll go much deeper with you.

23:15.530 --> 23:18.099
Islam and Christianity
share monotheism.

23:18.132 --> 23:21.936
And despite our tensions
in the past and in the present,

23:21.969 --> 23:23.838
we share Jesus.

23:23.871 --> 23:26.440
Yes. Yes.

23:26.474 --> 23:30.745
Jesus is considered
a messenger of God.

23:30.778 --> 23:34.115
A holy and revered prophet.

23:34.148 --> 23:36.884
Christians are unaware
of the fact

23:36.918 --> 23:39.954
that we love Jesus Christ.

23:39.987 --> 23:41.622
We love him.

23:41.656 --> 23:46.527
Muslims accept his birth
to be that of a good man,

23:46.561 --> 23:48.361
a great teacher,

23:48.395 --> 23:50.898
one of God's miracles
through Virgin Mary...

23:50.932 --> 23:53.333
or "Maryam."

23:56.971 --> 24:01.075
Well, uh, Mustafa, um...

24:02.109 --> 24:03.778
...since I'm here to talk,

24:03.811 --> 24:06.013
- as you say, honestly...
- Yes.

24:06.047 --> 24:08.983
...about Christianity, um...

24:14.689 --> 24:17.525
He may have been a great teacher

24:17.558 --> 24:19.560
and a good man...

24:20.862 --> 24:23.164
...but he was so much more.

24:23.197 --> 24:24.832
See...

24:27.535 --> 24:29.604
How do I say this?

24:29.637 --> 24:31.873
Oh, no, no, you don't.

24:38.913 --> 24:40.848
He is God.

24:44.652 --> 24:46.954
He is God.

24:50.825 --> 24:52.460
Um, uh, semantics.

24:52.493 --> 24:54.462
We-we... we say "prophet."

24:54.495 --> 24:56.564
Uh, that's what we say.
We say "prophet."

24:56.597 --> 24:57.832
No, not semantics.

24:57.865 --> 25:00.167
Jesus is God.

25:00.201 --> 25:04.572
He said, "I am the way,
the truth and the life."

25:06.774 --> 25:10.611
"And nobody comes to the Father
but by me."

25:11.846 --> 25:13.080
"For God so loved the world

25:13.114 --> 25:14.849
"that he gave
his only begotten son,

25:14.882 --> 25:18.085
"that whosoever believeth in him

25:18.119 --> 25:22.623
shall not perish
but have everlasting life."

25:23.791 --> 25:26.027
You say you love Jesus.

25:26.060 --> 25:28.496
Well, he loves you.

25:29.130 --> 25:30.665
Well, we love him.

25:30.698 --> 25:33.467
Of course, we...
we love Jesus Christ.

25:35.169 --> 25:37.738
And he wants to be your god.

25:39.941 --> 25:41.809
What are you doing?

25:41.842 --> 25:43.711
Mr. Rawlins. Mr. Rawlins.

25:43.744 --> 25:45.613
- Are you anti-Islam?
- Mr. Rawlins, are you aware

25:45.646 --> 25:47.181
that Cairo broadcast
your appearance

25:47.214 --> 25:48.716
to over 45 countries?

25:48.749 --> 25:50.217
It's gone viral
in the Middle East.

25:50.251 --> 25:51.886
Everyone is talking about it.

25:51.919 --> 25:53.754
- How does this make you feel?
- Many are saying

25:53.788 --> 25:56.123
you've crossed a line, that
you're preaching to Muslims.

25:56.157 --> 25:57.658
- Can you comment?
- Mr. Rawlins!

25:57.692 --> 25:59.093
Mr. Rawlins,
I need your comment.

26:00.561 --> 26:02.863
I was asked about my faith.

26:02.897 --> 26:04.765
I just said what I believed.

26:04.799 --> 26:06.734
Give him way, please.
Give him way.

26:06.767 --> 26:08.536
M-Mr. Rawlins,
one more question, please.

26:08.569 --> 26:10.838
Mr. Rawlins,
have you read the Koran?

26:10.871 --> 26:14.542
Yes, a friend of mine gave me
a copy, and I gave him a Bible.

26:14.575 --> 26:16.210
- Have a nice day.
- Give him way, please.

26:16.243 --> 26:18.779
Give him way. Give him way.

26:18.813 --> 26:21.215
How many followers do you have?

26:24.752 --> 26:26.654
Quite a show, mate.

26:26.687 --> 26:28.189
Very impressive.

26:28.222 --> 26:30.758
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

26:30.791 --> 26:32.693
There I am watching telly

26:32.727 --> 26:35.096
when, all of a sudden,
I see this milky white

26:35.129 --> 26:38.199
upper-middle-class
American wanker

26:38.232 --> 26:42.003
who reckons he can preach
to a billion Muslims.

26:44.238 --> 26:47.108
Well, I was invited.

26:47.141 --> 26:49.510
Not by me, mate.

26:50.678 --> 26:52.546
Not by me.

26:55.850 --> 26:58.052
Excuse me.

27:41.228 --> 27:43.931
You really
did it this time, Doug.

27:43.964 --> 27:45.800
You really stirred it up.

27:45.833 --> 27:47.835
You're preaching.

27:47.868 --> 27:49.770
It weirds people out.

27:49.804 --> 27:52.173
Look, the reason
the talk caught fire

27:52.206 --> 27:54.875
is because I said
what was unexpected.

27:54.909 --> 27:57.178
But damn it, I was just
trying to be honest.

27:57.211 --> 27:58.846
I-I was just trying to be real.

27:58.879 --> 28:02.216
By the way, your friends
Javid and, uh, Soheila...

28:02.249 --> 28:04.652
Come on, Liz.
They weren't your friends, too?

28:04.685 --> 28:05.886
They've... they've moved out.

28:05.920 --> 28:07.088
What?

28:07.121 --> 28:08.989
They just vanished.

28:09.023 --> 28:10.724
What about Meena?

28:11.692 --> 28:14.061
Nothing. That's all I know.

28:14.095 --> 28:15.996
Maybe you should
check in at work

28:16.030 --> 28:18.099
and see if he's showed up there.

28:18.132 --> 28:20.367
My guess is: likely not.

28:21.235 --> 28:23.137
What about us, Liz?

28:25.172 --> 28:27.141
Are we okay?

28:30.177 --> 28:31.879
Who's there?

28:31.912 --> 28:33.080
What?

28:33.114 --> 28:34.315
Hold on.

28:34.348 --> 28:35.816
What?

28:37.084 --> 28:38.052
Yeah?

28:38.085 --> 28:40.754
Doug? What's going on?

28:40.788 --> 28:41.856
Who's there?

28:42.591 --> 28:45.392
Doug?

28:45.427 --> 28:46.293
Doug!

28:46.327 --> 28:48.162
Doug?

28:48.662 --> 28:50.998
What's going on? Doug!

28:53.868 --> 28:55.069
Can you hear me?

28:55.102 --> 28:58.038
Doug?

28:58.072 --> 29:00.674
Doug, what's... what's going on?

29:01.375 --> 29:03.445
Doug!

29:03.478 --> 29:04.879
Doug!

29:11.085 --> 29:12.686
Can you hear me?

29:12.720 --> 29:14.155
Doug!

29:14.989 --> 29:15.956
Doug!

29:53.327 --> 29:56.096
He's caused
an international incident.

29:56.130 --> 29:58.332
He was kidnapped.

29:58.365 --> 30:00.167
This is terrorism.

30:00.201 --> 30:02.369
It's not his fault.

30:07.241 --> 30:10.010
You got to get him out.

30:10.044 --> 30:11.312
They're working on it, right?

30:11.345 --> 30:13.113
The-the... the government...

30:13.147 --> 30:16.016
the agency, I mean,
they're working on it.

30:16.050 --> 30:19.053
We're getting
our fact pattern in order.

30:19.086 --> 30:20.354
Fact pattern?

30:20.387 --> 30:21.855
We'll get back to you.

30:22.856 --> 30:24.325
Talk to no one.

30:24.358 --> 30:27.094
Are we clear on that, Liz?

30:27.127 --> 30:30.364
About a fact pattern? Yes.

30:31.198 --> 30:32.866
Good.

30:53.421 --> 30:55.122
Look around you.

30:55.155 --> 30:57.492
You are in the middle
of fucking nowhere.

30:57.525 --> 31:00.428
No one knows where you are.

31:00.462 --> 31:02.464
And it's gonna stay that way.

31:02.497 --> 31:03.998
We agree?

31:09.303 --> 31:12.139
Do we fucking agree?

31:12.172 --> 31:13.941
Yes.

31:13.974 --> 31:14.842
Good.

31:14.875 --> 31:18.446
You got a bed,
got a table, got a chair.

31:18.480 --> 31:20.014
Look at you.

31:20.047 --> 31:21.148
You're all set.

31:21.181 --> 31:23.050
Toilet's down the hall.

31:23.083 --> 31:25.420
Why am I here?

31:27.855 --> 31:31.125
What sort of lunatic...
what sort of muppet...

31:31.158 --> 31:34.562
comes to the Middle East
to convert Muslims?

31:41.201 --> 31:43.070
Take him to the loo.

32:30.418 --> 32:32.019
Mountains.

32:33.987 --> 32:35.956
Baalbek.

32:35.989 --> 32:37.459
Lebanon.

32:40.961 --> 32:42.196
Hey. Hey.

32:42.229 --> 32:44.432
Can you hear me?

32:47.267 --> 32:49.103
Help me.

32:56.977 --> 32:58.480
Oh, shit.

32:59.313 --> 33:00.548
Hey, kid.

33:01.382 --> 33:03.016
Yeah.

33:03.050 --> 33:04.084
Hey.

33:04.118 --> 33:05.219
Help me.

33:05.252 --> 33:06.353
Can you...

33:06.387 --> 33:07.422
Sweetheart, can you...

33:07.455 --> 33:09.390
Can you get your mama?

33:09.424 --> 33:11.258
Yeah.

33:11.291 --> 33:12.660
Yeah. Get her.

33:13.528 --> 33:14.928
Yeah.

33:18.098 --> 33:19.299
Finish!

33:19.333 --> 33:22.069
I got to... I'm almost...

33:29.143 --> 33:31.646
I had to go real bad.

33:49.329 --> 33:52.065
<i>Mrs. Rawlins,
why did your husband go there?</i>

33:52.099 --> 33:53.668
Do you have anything
to do with this?

33:53.701 --> 33:55.302
Has the State Department
been helping you?

33:55.335 --> 33:57.439
Who would want to kidnap him?

33:57.472 --> 33:59.574
Mrs. Rawlins,
do you care to comment?

33:59.607 --> 34:01.643
- Mrs. Rawlins!
- Do you know who kidnapped him?

34:03.745 --> 34:05.979
Mrs. Rawlins, do you know
about his whereabouts?

34:06.013 --> 34:08.215
What are you hiding from us?

34:08.248 --> 34:10.250
Well, why do you say that?

34:10.284 --> 34:12.454
I mean, have we really
become that callous?

34:12.487 --> 34:14.656
Is our government that uncaring?

34:14.689 --> 34:17.224
Look, when
a prominent Christian blogger,

34:17.257 --> 34:19.393
whose wife happens to work
at the State Department,

34:19.427 --> 34:22.430
goes on his own free will
to appear on television

34:22.464 --> 34:24.599
in the Middle East
and proselytize,

34:24.632 --> 34:26.066
that's his business.

34:26.099 --> 34:28.135
But when he gets kidnapped
for doing it,

34:28.168 --> 34:30.137
don't expect
the United States government

34:30.170 --> 34:32.339
to drop everything
and come to your rescue,

34:32.372 --> 34:35.108
no matter who you are
or who your wife is.

34:35.142 --> 34:37.110
<i>You're famous, mate.</i>

34:37.144 --> 34:40.748
Internet is lit up. You're
the man of the fucking hour.

34:44.586 --> 34:46.521
Been reading your blog.

34:46.554 --> 34:50.290
Your musings
on Jesus the Christ,

34:50.324 --> 34:53.393
going to church,
your little buddy at work.

34:53.428 --> 34:55.996
What's his name?
The one that calls you Kuffs.

34:56.631 --> 34:57.732
Kuffs?

34:57.765 --> 35:01.268
Short for "kafir"... infidel.

35:01.301 --> 35:04.405
- Javid?
- Javid.

35:04.439 --> 35:06.240
Sounds Persian.

35:06.273 --> 35:08.443
Fucking hate Persians.

35:08.476 --> 35:10.545
I'm half Persian.

35:10.578 --> 35:13.080
Luckily,
the other half's Kurdish.

35:15.717 --> 35:17.685
This blog of yours...

35:17.719 --> 35:21.723
personally, I don't see
any reason why it should stop.

35:23.323 --> 35:25.158
You want me to...

35:25.192 --> 35:27.595
- post my blog from here?
- Yeah.

35:27.629 --> 35:29.764
Who's posted from captivity?

35:29.797 --> 35:34.602
Mate, I'm setting you up
for a fucking Pulitzer.

35:34.636 --> 35:37.539
I'll help you,
put it online for you.

35:37.572 --> 35:39.273
Here's what I need, though.

35:39.306 --> 35:40.808
I need your password.

35:41.776 --> 35:45.813
Problem is, is then
you would be writing my blog,

35:45.847 --> 35:47.314
not me.

35:47.347 --> 35:49.851
Well, I'm not
a fucking idiot, am I?

35:49.884 --> 35:52.085
So I'm not just gonna
hand you a laptop

35:52.119 --> 35:53.621
and let you do what you want.

35:53.655 --> 35:55.255
It's my blog.

35:55.289 --> 35:56.524
All right.

35:56.558 --> 35:57.825
That's fair.

35:57.859 --> 36:00.160
Let me show you something.
Look at this.

36:07.602 --> 36:09.136
See this plonker?

36:09.169 --> 36:10.738
He didn't give me
his password, either.

36:10.772 --> 36:14.442
So I took some electrodes,
and I fried his balls off.

36:14.475 --> 36:16.544
Those electrical prods,

36:16.578 --> 36:18.513
they really fuck
your fertility up.

36:18.546 --> 36:21.281
Now, imagine if I apply those
to your teeth and gums.

36:21.315 --> 36:24.184
Do you reckon your missus
would ever fuck you again?

36:26.688 --> 36:29.289
Now, I'll be honest, man.

36:29.323 --> 36:32.125
I don't... I don't love
the ultraviolence.

36:32.159 --> 36:35.530
I'm more of an artist type,
aren't I?

36:35.563 --> 36:37.532
Sensitive.

36:37.565 --> 36:40.233
Anyway, give me your password,

36:40.267 --> 36:42.470
or I'll fry
your little jelly beans.

36:42.503 --> 36:43.738
No.

36:43.771 --> 36:46.139
A no.

36:46.173 --> 36:47.408
Okay.

36:50.778 --> 36:52.413
Are you taking the piss?

36:52.447 --> 36:55.750
Are you taking the fucking piss?!

37:21.976 --> 37:23.678
No. No!

37:23.711 --> 37:24.946
No.

37:24.979 --> 37:27.515
We're here to power-drill
your kneecaps.

37:27.548 --> 37:28.716
Cool with that?

37:28.750 --> 37:30.551
No! No, no.

37:30.585 --> 37:32.920
Wait, wait, wait. No.

37:32.954 --> 37:35.389
- Password, please.
- O-Okay, okay, okay.

37:35.423 --> 37:38.526
Uh, Liz, zero,

37:38.559 --> 37:40.795
uh, nine, 19, forward slash, 85.

37:40.828 --> 37:43.163
- Say again.
- Liz, zero!

37:43.831 --> 37:45.767
Nine, 19,

37:45.800 --> 37:49.771
forward slash, 85.

37:51.539 --> 37:54.207
Look at that. We're in.

37:55.743 --> 37:57.445
That wasn't so hard, was it?

37:57.478 --> 37:59.279
Well, untie him, then.

37:59.312 --> 38:02.850
How is he gonna write
with his hands tied?

38:04.251 --> 38:05.687
You're gonna be
a sensation, mate.

38:05.720 --> 38:07.722
First person who ever blogged
from captivity

38:07.755 --> 38:09.289
in a Muslim cell.

38:12.460 --> 38:14.394
What are you waiting for?

38:14.429 --> 38:16.731
Come on. Chop-chop.

38:19.299 --> 38:21.936
Can I get it to you
in the morning?

38:23.004 --> 38:24.872
Please.

38:27.775 --> 38:29.911
You said the magic word.

38:38.986 --> 38:42.222
You saw that, didn't you?

38:44.759 --> 38:46.861
You're a smart guy.

38:55.036 --> 38:57.839
But not smart enough.

39:04.412 --> 39:07.247
"You'll be a sensation, mate."

39:07.982 --> 39:10.618
"Dude's being held
in a Muslim cell

39:10.651 --> 39:12.787
and writes about it."

39:12.820 --> 39:15.790
"You write the blog.
I'll post it."

39:25.900 --> 39:27.635
What's that?

39:27.668 --> 39:28.903
Don't worry.

39:28.936 --> 39:30.004
It's not for your jelly beans.

39:30.037 --> 39:32.006
This is for your laptop.

39:32.039 --> 39:35.443
This represents my commitment
to your craft.

39:35.476 --> 39:38.880
Now you can write
all the way through the night.

39:41.549 --> 39:43.985
So, if you would just
leave me in peace,

39:44.018 --> 39:46.821
I could get more work done.

39:47.688 --> 39:49.289
Please.

39:50.591 --> 39:52.059
Yeah.

40:00.968 --> 40:03.437
You are fucking irritating,
you know that?

40:05.139 --> 40:07.975
Actually, my wife says
the same thing.

40:08.009 --> 40:09.443
She's a perceptive woman.

40:09.477 --> 40:11.913
Do you think she'd mind
if you were dead?

40:12.914 --> 40:16.017
Well, I certainly hope
she would, but who knows?

40:16.050 --> 40:18.019
I want her to.

40:25.927 --> 40:27.762
You smug piece of shit.

40:27.795 --> 40:29.997
This is my fucking house.

40:30.031 --> 40:32.033
You mind your manners
in my fucking house.

40:32.066 --> 40:33.668
You understand me?

40:33.701 --> 40:36.336
Sorry.

41:04.632 --> 41:06.634
What's going on?

41:16.644 --> 41:19.113
Has something happened
with Doug?

41:24.986 --> 41:26.420
Why am I...

41:26.454 --> 41:28.789
Before you go nuts on me,
I have news.

41:28.823 --> 41:32.894
Our sources tell us
Doug was nabbed by Hezbollah,

41:32.927 --> 41:36.130
that he's likely being held...

41:38.833 --> 41:40.735
...somewhere in Lebanon.

41:40.768 --> 41:42.169
Okay.

41:42.203 --> 41:45.506
The Baalbek region is
a Hezbollah stronghold.

41:45.539 --> 41:48.576
Hezbollah is trained
and equipped by Iran.

41:48.609 --> 41:51.846
So, are there any discussions
or demands?

41:51.879 --> 41:53.748
Is there a plan to get Doug out?

41:53.781 --> 41:55.716
Our Operations Center
is in communication

41:55.750 --> 41:57.785
with the Baalbek authorities,
the local police,

41:57.818 --> 41:59.086
to keep an eye.

41:59.120 --> 42:01.022
But you said it was
a Hezbollah stronghold.

42:01.055 --> 42:04.058
Won't they just
give him back to them?

42:05.226 --> 42:07.528
Baalbek is tiring of terrorism.

42:07.561 --> 42:10.031
Thousands have died
fighting in Syria,

42:10.064 --> 42:11.565
their finances have been frozen,

42:11.599 --> 42:13.234
and the Lebanese
are growing weary.

42:13.267 --> 42:16.604
They'll let us know
if they find anything.

42:17.238 --> 42:19.540
Why am I locked out?

42:20.274 --> 42:22.109
You feel like you're drowning,

42:22.143 --> 42:26.080
so you grasp and lunge
for a lifeline.

42:26.113 --> 42:28.549
There is no lifeline.

42:29.750 --> 42:30.985
Yeah, I know that.

42:31.018 --> 42:32.253
Really?

42:32.286 --> 42:34.622
Let me give you an example.

42:34.655 --> 42:36.924
Two Iranian Jews
were rounded up recently

42:36.958 --> 42:38.759
by the Islamic Republic of Iran,

42:38.793 --> 42:41.529
accused of being spies
for the Israeli Mossad.

42:41.562 --> 42:44.031
Do you think the Israelis will
launch a raid to free them?

42:44.065 --> 42:45.700
Not a chance.

42:45.733 --> 42:47.601
The days of Entebbe
are long over.

42:47.635 --> 42:50.972
You're not to call the CIA,
FBI, Homeland Security

42:51.005 --> 42:53.941
or any other government agency
to inquire about your husband.

42:53.975 --> 42:55.142
Is that understood?

42:55.176 --> 42:56.811
I just can't...

42:56.844 --> 42:58.879
The secretary is very concerned
about the press scrutiny

42:58.913 --> 43:01.048
Doug's trip has brought
upon this department and you.

43:01.082 --> 43:03.551
- He's my husband.
- Yes, he is.

43:03.584 --> 43:06.520
Therefore, you need
a leave of absence.

43:07.722 --> 43:09.991
It's for the best.

43:19.033 --> 43:20.301
<i>Good work.</i>

43:20.334 --> 43:22.536
Yeah, this will up your value.

43:22.570 --> 43:24.005
Well done.

43:24.038 --> 43:26.207
Over to the audience now.

43:26.240 --> 43:28.175
So, I've done what you've asked.

43:28.209 --> 43:30.745
When do you plan to let me go?

43:30.778 --> 43:32.646
Let you go?

43:32.680 --> 43:35.216
Nah, nah, we're just
getting started, mate.

43:35.249 --> 43:37.685
Me and you have got
a lot to talk about.

43:37.718 --> 43:39.220
Okay.

43:39.253 --> 43:41.188
Let's talk.

43:44.091 --> 43:45.826
Are you Hezbollah?

43:48.229 --> 43:49.997
Am I Hezbollah?

43:50.031 --> 43:51.966
Doesn't matter
what the fuck I am.

43:51.999 --> 43:54.602
You're CIA, same as your bird.

43:54.635 --> 43:55.770
- My bird?
- Your wife.

43:55.803 --> 43:57.138
Your missus.
Your significant other.

43:57.171 --> 43:58.773
She's CIA, and so are you.

43:59.907 --> 44:01.809
She... she works trade policy.

44:01.842 --> 44:04.145
Is that why she called the
police on the Hosseini home?

44:04.178 --> 44:05.780
What?

44:05.813 --> 44:08.182
Is that why she called the
police on the Hosseini home?

44:08.215 --> 44:10.217
Is that why,
when you went there,

44:10.251 --> 44:12.253
the police showed you
his fucking basement?

44:12.286 --> 44:15.322
You're fucking CIA,
and so is your missus,

44:15.356 --> 44:18.025
and the two of you set him up.

44:18.059 --> 44:19.827
That's why I'm here?

44:19.860 --> 44:21.662
Sort of.

44:22.329 --> 44:25.366
You blew our prize operative.

44:25.399 --> 44:27.802
You blew our prize operative.

44:27.835 --> 44:29.804
I only went to Cairo
to keep a fucking eye on you,

44:29.837 --> 44:31.605
then you get up
in front of two billion people

44:31.639 --> 44:33.040
and try and convert them.

44:33.074 --> 44:36.110
So the word comes down:
"He's dangerous. Pick him up."

44:40.014 --> 44:41.882
Bring him outside.

45:02.269 --> 45:03.871
It's tea.

45:03.904 --> 45:05.139
Turkish tea.

45:05.172 --> 45:07.174
It's really good.

45:10.678 --> 45:12.379
Thank you.

45:19.086 --> 45:23.057
My first memory in life was
clutching my grandmother's hand

45:23.090 --> 45:28.028
as we were being chased
down Chingford High Street

45:28.062 --> 45:29.697
by a bunch of neo-Nazi skinheads

45:29.730 --> 45:33.033
throwing milk bottles
at our heads,

45:33.067 --> 45:36.137
telling us to get the fuck out
of their country.

45:36.170 --> 45:37.972
I was four, mate.

45:38.005 --> 45:40.708
Messed me up for a while.

45:40.741 --> 45:44.678
Desperately made me want
to fit in.

45:45.813 --> 45:47.047
Then...

45:47.081 --> 45:50.751
the big guy spoke to me.

45:50.784 --> 45:53.687
He said, "Son, it's always
been this way."

45:53.721 --> 45:57.391
Been Crusaders on horseback,
Gulf War, Afghanistan.

45:57.425 --> 45:59.461
Chingford High Street.

45:59.494 --> 46:03.697
This is me now throwing
milk bottles at your heads,

46:03.731 --> 46:06.066
telling you get the fuck out
of our countries.

46:06.100 --> 46:08.936
You started this holy war, mate.

46:12.907 --> 46:15.142
We're gonna finish it.

46:21.182 --> 46:23.250
What are you doing?

46:23.284 --> 46:25.352
Give him his tea.

47:41.095 --> 47:43.063
I'm gonna get you out of there.

47:43.097 --> 47:44.832
I'll get you out of there, Doug.

47:45.966 --> 47:48.135
Some bastard on the Internet
decoded Doug's message.

47:48.168 --> 47:50.137
- What? Who?
- This fellow.

47:50.170 --> 47:53.040
What's his name? Alias 9.

47:53.073 --> 47:55.109
May have just given him
a death sentence.

47:55.142 --> 47:56.877
Shit.

47:56.910 --> 47:59.380
Oh, my God.

48:00.214 --> 48:01.949
What did you do?

48:01.982 --> 48:03.485
- What?
- What did you do?!

48:07.288 --> 48:10.024
What did you fucking do?!

48:11.125 --> 48:12.793
What did you do?!

48:29.209 --> 48:30.844
Move. Move!

48:54.068 --> 48:56.003
Leave him!

49:37.412 --> 49:39.213
I'm Doug Rawlins.

49:39.246 --> 49:40.515
Will you... will you help me?

49:40.548 --> 49:42.249
My-my name is Doug...

49:42.282 --> 49:43.618
Doug... Douglas Rawlins.

49:43.651 --> 49:47.187
I'm an American.
I was kidnapped, and-and...

49:49.424 --> 49:51.125
No. No.

49:51.158 --> 49:52.594
Help. Help. Help.

49:52.627 --> 49:54.629
Please, Officer.

49:54.662 --> 49:56.564
- My name is Doug Rawlins.
- Who are you?

49:56.598 --> 49:58.132
My name is Doug Rawlins.

49:58.165 --> 49:59.667
I was kidnapped in Cairo.

49:59.701 --> 50:01.368
- You are him? Do you have an identity card?
- Yeah, I am.

50:01.403 --> 50:03.671
- I told you I was kidnapped!
- Let me see your...

50:03.705 --> 50:05.105
Why-why would I have
an identity card?

50:05.139 --> 50:06.474
I was kidnapped,
for crying out loud.

50:06.508 --> 50:08.041
These are the men!

50:08.075 --> 50:09.711
No! Don't let 'em take me!

50:09.744 --> 50:12.379
Don't let 'em take me!
Don't let 'em take me!

50:17.452 --> 50:19.487
Oh, shit!

50:21.656 --> 50:23.625
Somebody help! Somebody help.

50:29.564 --> 50:32.132
I got bad news.
You're not going anywhere, sir.

50:32.166 --> 50:34.669
Your time with me is gonna seem
like a fucking holiday.

52:18.238 --> 52:20.575
<i>Okay, just tell me</i>

52:20.608 --> 52:22.175
what they're saying.

52:22.209 --> 52:23.210
Tell me, please.

52:23.243 --> 52:26.179
He's either dead
or they've moved him somewhere.

52:26.213 --> 52:27.448
Where?

52:27.482 --> 52:29.149
Iran keeps coming up.

52:29.182 --> 52:31.118
If they're not holding him,
they know where he is.

52:31.151 --> 52:32.754
Iran's calling all the shots.

52:32.787 --> 52:34.254
I should go.

52:34.288 --> 52:36.123
A woman alone
in that part of the world?

52:36.156 --> 52:37.525
- Liz, it's crazy.
- Well, I've got to do something.

52:37.559 --> 52:38.660
It's dangerous.

52:38.693 --> 52:40.528
And at minimum, if Doug is dead,

52:40.562 --> 52:42.597
I can bring his body back.

52:45.767 --> 52:49.437
Liz, don't go
and get yourself killed.

52:49.470 --> 52:52.139
I can't give up on him.

53:10.157 --> 53:11.859
Mrs. Rawlins,
why are you here?

53:11.893 --> 53:13.393
- Move! Move!
- Please.

53:13.428 --> 53:15.128
- Move.
- Do you think your husband is here?

53:15.162 --> 53:16.431
Mrs. Rawlins,
greetings from Tehran.

53:16.464 --> 53:18.198
You will come with me
most immediately.

53:18.231 --> 53:19.901
- Out of the way!
- Are you expecting help from

53:19.934 --> 53:22.570
- the government?
- We're going to the Ministry of Justice.

53:22.604 --> 53:23.838
Please, please, answer us!

54:12.252 --> 54:14.455
<i>Are you willing
to help Mrs. Rawlins</i>

54:14.489 --> 54:15.857
<i>to find her husband?</i>

54:15.890 --> 54:17.759
What information
do you have for us, Ayatollah?

54:17.792 --> 54:18.926
Any information at all,
Ayatollah Tehrani?

54:18.960 --> 54:20.461
Please come over here.

54:23.765 --> 54:26.366
In the name of God,
I'm here today

54:26.401 --> 54:27.669
with nice American lady.

54:27.702 --> 54:29.671
She's here in
the Islamic Republic

54:29.704 --> 54:32.740
for assistance
in finding her husband.

54:32.774 --> 54:34.341
<i>We will assist her.</i>

54:34.374 --> 54:37.445
<i>At present,
we do not know where he is.</i>

54:37.478 --> 54:40.247
<i>Apparently,
he was on TV in Cairo.</i>

54:40.280 --> 54:42.617
What do you want from me?

54:52.292 --> 54:55.262
What do you want?!
What do you want?!

54:55.295 --> 54:56.898
- What do you want?!
- <i>He's an American</i>

54:56.931 --> 54:58.800
who has disappeared.

54:58.833 --> 55:00.668
Maybe he runs away
from his wife.

55:00.702 --> 55:03.236
I've heard of this before.

55:03.270 --> 55:05.673
My husband
was kidnapped in Cairo.

55:05.707 --> 55:07.274
He was taken to Lebanon.

55:07.307 --> 55:09.911
We know nothing beyond that.
Absolutely nothing.

55:09.944 --> 55:12.814
There are rumors
about this man's activities.

55:12.847 --> 55:14.882
And Mrs. Rawlins works
for her government.

55:14.916 --> 55:17.384
- Um, but what does all this...
- We must consider...

55:17.418 --> 55:21.254
Sorry. What does all this matter
if you're not holding him?

55:21.288 --> 55:22.690
It's a matter of justice.

55:22.724 --> 55:25.860
Our intelligence services
are gathering information.

55:25.893 --> 55:27.528
<i>If they learn of anything...</i>

55:27.562 --> 55:28.996
- Please don't do this.
- <i>...we're willing to send</i>

55:29.030 --> 55:31.766
<i>our forces to rescue him.</i>

55:31.799 --> 55:33.534
This is very risky for us.

55:33.568 --> 55:36.838
But we do it because
we are compassionate.

55:36.871 --> 55:37.905
<i>We are merciful.</i>

55:39.474 --> 55:42.275
God, please. Stop.

55:42.309 --> 55:45.747
I've done nothing wrong!

55:45.780 --> 55:46.881
<i>Dr. Tehrani, please...</i>

55:46.914 --> 55:48.281
Praise be to Allah.

55:48.315 --> 55:49.550
Are you going to protect
Mrs. Rawlins?

55:49.584 --> 55:51.586
May he show us
the righteous path

55:51.619 --> 55:54.021
so that we may repel
the enemies of God

55:54.055 --> 55:55.590
and the corrupt of the Earth.

55:55.623 --> 55:57.425
Anything to say
about what you just heard?

55:57.458 --> 55:58.893
Please, are you...
are you okay? Mrs. Rawlins.

56:01.763 --> 56:04.465
Tell me what you want!

56:37.465 --> 56:41.402
I'm Pierre Barthes,
South African Telemedia.

56:41.435 --> 56:43.571
Maria. Maria Landi from Rome.

56:43.604 --> 56:46.040
Yes, we interviewed
your husband in Cairo.

56:46.073 --> 56:48.042
We've been following the case.

56:48.075 --> 56:51.612
Yes, I saw you
at the Ministry of Justice.

56:51.646 --> 56:54.649
We apologize for participating
in such a fraud,

56:54.682 --> 56:57.618
but any publicity helps
your husband's case, right?

56:57.652 --> 56:59.352
Yeah, sure.

56:59.386 --> 57:01.789
We'd love to do one-on-ones
with you if that's possible.

57:01.823 --> 57:02.990
Will you talk to us?

57:03.024 --> 57:04.391
Oh, perhaps later.

57:04.425 --> 57:05.960
I don't want to do anything

57:05.993 --> 57:08.395
that might upset
the Iranian government

57:08.429 --> 57:09.764
or harm Doug.

57:09.797 --> 57:11.398
So, thank you.

57:24.412 --> 57:26.814
Do you believe Doug's alive?

57:26.848 --> 57:28.683
I know he is.

57:28.716 --> 57:29.917
But how do you know?

57:29.951 --> 57:31.886
I just know.

57:32.720 --> 57:33.988
Okay.

57:34.021 --> 57:35.656
So, what's your plan?

57:35.690 --> 57:37.592
- Plan?
- Yes.

57:37.625 --> 57:40.428
If he's still alive,
if he's here,

57:40.461 --> 57:41.963
you need a plan.

57:41.996 --> 57:44.065
You need help.

57:44.098 --> 57:46.601
Leverage. Do you understand?

57:46.634 --> 57:48.135
Otherwise, they'll use you
to their advantage,

57:48.169 --> 57:49.904
- just like the press conference.
- What leverage?

57:49.937 --> 57:52.907
I came here to plead
for his life.

57:52.940 --> 57:54.709
That's it.

57:54.742 --> 57:56.611
That's my plan.

57:57.812 --> 57:59.146
Where are you going?

57:59.180 --> 58:01.148
I can't just sit in my room.

58:01.182 --> 58:02.717
Be careful out there.

58:02.750 --> 58:04.418
Don't talk to anybody.

58:04.452 --> 58:06.120
- Do not make appointments.
- Okay. Thank you, thank you.

58:57.171 --> 58:59.206
Welcome to the bazaar, lady.

58:59.240 --> 59:01.075
Welcome to Tehran.

59:01.108 --> 59:03.110
Thank you.

59:03.144 --> 59:05.179
We can help you with problem.

59:06.681 --> 59:08.082
He's here, your husband.

59:08.115 --> 59:09.684
How do you know that?

59:10.818 --> 59:12.053
Have you seen him?

59:13.788 --> 59:15.456
Yes.

59:16.624 --> 59:17.825
I have a photo.

59:17.858 --> 59:19.627
You have a photograph of Doug?

59:20.928 --> 59:22.596
A current one?

59:23.531 --> 59:26.667
I would be very grateful
for something like that.

59:26.701 --> 59:27.835
You'll pay, yes?

59:27.868 --> 59:29.470
Yes, I can pay. Yes.

59:30.805 --> 59:34.642
Could you send it to my...
my phone or my computer?

59:35.843 --> 59:37.912
Come. I show you first.

59:37.945 --> 59:40.247
You pay, then I send you.

59:40.281 --> 59:42.750
- Come where?
- Nearby.

59:42.783 --> 59:47.989
Lady, this photo is proof
your husband is here and alive.

59:48.022 --> 59:49.623
Come with me.

59:49.657 --> 59:51.258
Come.

1:00:28.095 --> 1:00:30.097
Come.

1:00:35.836 --> 1:00:38.039
Is here, the photo.

1:00:38.072 --> 1:00:39.206
Come on.

1:00:39.240 --> 1:00:42.309
Um, can you bring it out?

1:00:57.324 --> 1:00:59.693
Sorry?

1:00:59.727 --> 1:01:01.962
Come.

1:01:01.996 --> 1:01:04.265
- Come on.
- Oh, forget it.

1:01:14.241 --> 1:01:17.211
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

1:01:18.145 --> 1:01:19.780
Just wait. Just calm down.

1:01:22.149 --> 1:01:24.285
Be cool.

1:01:29.023 --> 1:01:30.291
It's all right. It's all right.

1:01:30.324 --> 1:01:32.193
We're your friends.
We're your friends.

1:01:32.226 --> 1:01:34.662
We're not with them.

1:01:35.763 --> 1:01:37.098
We're friends.

1:01:37.131 --> 1:01:38.833
We won't harm you.

1:01:38.866 --> 1:01:41.735
Here.

1:01:41.769 --> 1:01:42.870
Thank you.

1:01:43.971 --> 1:01:45.239
Who are you?

1:01:45.272 --> 1:01:49.243
This is my husband Fereydoun.
I'm Fariba.

1:01:49.276 --> 1:01:50.945
We are Christians.

1:01:50.978 --> 1:01:52.346
We read Doug's blog.

1:01:52.379 --> 1:01:54.715
We've been following you.

1:01:54.748 --> 1:01:55.916
You're safe now.

1:01:55.950 --> 1:01:59.286
You're kidding me.

1:02:01.055 --> 1:02:02.923
You are okay?

1:02:08.395 --> 1:02:10.397
Please, there are, uh,

1:02:10.432 --> 1:02:12.967
some people here
who want to meet you.

1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:15.169
And... and we have food.

1:02:17.738 --> 1:02:19.640
Hello. Welcome.

1:02:24.044 --> 1:02:25.713
Hello.

1:02:27.348 --> 1:02:31.318
Please. We have pastry and tea.

1:02:31.352 --> 1:02:33.888
And we have news.

1:02:34.989 --> 1:02:36.290
This is Aziz.

1:02:37.091 --> 1:02:40.995
A guard at Prison 209
here in Tehran.

1:02:41.028 --> 1:02:43.364
Prison 209?

1:02:43.397 --> 1:02:45.966
It's maximum security
for special prisoners.

1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:47.902
Political prisoners.

1:02:47.935 --> 1:02:50.171
Aziz...

1:02:50.204 --> 1:02:52.106
I am Muslim, not Christian.

1:02:52.139 --> 1:02:53.908
I'm here to resist
the government.

1:02:53.941 --> 1:02:56.911
I have guards with me,
also Muslim.

1:02:56.944 --> 1:03:01.248
Your husband,
he's been there for one week.

1:03:03.083 --> 1:03:04.885
Please have a seat.

1:03:07.221 --> 1:03:09.156
Um...

1:03:09.190 --> 1:03:11.892
th-the press don't know.

1:03:11.926 --> 1:03:14.795
Well, the-the government
hasn't said anything.

1:03:17.064 --> 1:03:19.133
It is very risky,

1:03:19.166 --> 1:03:23.471
but he will try to take a photo
and send it to you.

1:03:23.505 --> 1:03:25.272
I will give him your number.

1:03:25.306 --> 1:03:28.209
Would you like to write
a message to Doug?

1:03:28.242 --> 1:03:29.777
Oh, yes.

1:03:29.810 --> 1:03:31.413
Yeah.

1:03:33.214 --> 1:03:34.782
Um...

1:03:34.815 --> 1:03:36.418
Please.

1:04:46.954 --> 1:04:48.856
Thank you.

1:04:49.890 --> 1:04:51.426
And...

1:04:51.459 --> 1:04:53.927
Doug, he's, uh...

1:04:53.961 --> 1:04:56.397
He's-he's okay.

1:05:02.504 --> 1:05:06.907
Um, it's very kind of you to...

1:05:08.410 --> 1:05:10.110
...to show your concern.

1:05:10.144 --> 1:05:11.245
Thank you.

1:05:11.278 --> 1:05:13.247
This is our church.

1:05:13.280 --> 1:05:16.050
We meet here regularly.

1:05:16.083 --> 1:05:17.918
Oh.

1:05:17.951 --> 1:05:20.488
There's a Christian movement
inside Iran,

1:05:20.522 --> 1:05:23.991
led by women
tired of being victims.

1:05:26.226 --> 1:05:29.330
How about you, your faith?

1:05:41.041 --> 1:05:43.310
Uh, I'm, um...

1:05:43.344 --> 1:05:44.612
I'm tired. I just...

1:05:44.646 --> 1:05:48.048
I want to go back
to my hotel room.

1:05:48.082 --> 1:05:49.883
I understand.

1:05:50.585 --> 1:05:52.986
- Get some rest.
- Oh.

1:05:58.693 --> 1:06:01.496
Come on. Let's get you a cab.

1:06:10.337 --> 1:06:12.172
No. No, don't hurt me.

1:06:12.206 --> 1:06:14.007
Don't hurt me, please.

1:06:14.676 --> 1:06:17.545
I'm the one who told 'em
not to hurt you, mate.

1:06:18.680 --> 1:06:20.314
Doug...

1:06:20.347 --> 1:06:22.883
you're swimming
in an ocean of shit.

1:06:23.951 --> 1:06:25.620
Time to get back
on the boat, mate.

1:06:25.653 --> 1:06:27.489
There's no fighting 'em.

1:06:30.357 --> 1:06:32.359
I just want to...

1:06:32.393 --> 1:06:34.228
go home.

1:06:34.261 --> 1:06:36.163
Of course you do, mate.

1:06:36.196 --> 1:06:37.599
Of course you do.

1:06:37.632 --> 1:06:39.601
They beat you hard enough,

1:06:39.634 --> 1:06:42.537
you lose your grip,
you lose your faith.

1:06:42.570 --> 1:06:44.539
Lose everything.

1:06:44.572 --> 1:06:47.542
Doug, listen to me.

1:06:47.575 --> 1:06:48.942
The only way out of here

1:06:48.976 --> 1:06:50.678
is to tell them
what they want to hear.

1:06:51.311 --> 1:06:52.714
Repudiate Cairo,
admit you're a spy,

1:06:52.747 --> 1:06:54.214
they'll let you go.

1:06:54.248 --> 1:06:56.618
I promise I'll make that happen.

1:06:59.987 --> 1:07:01.723
'Cause they're not gonna stop.

1:07:03.758 --> 1:07:06.093
Tell your high priest...

1:07:07.261 --> 1:07:09.229
...to go fuck himself.

1:07:17.204 --> 1:07:19.441
Fair enough.

1:07:19.474 --> 1:07:21.175
No one knows you're here.

1:07:21.208 --> 1:07:22.644
As far as the world
is concerned,

1:07:22.677 --> 1:07:24.211
you're dead and buried, so...

1:07:24.244 --> 1:07:26.448
your only hope is to come clean.

1:07:32.787 --> 1:07:35.022
Otherwise, you'll rot.

1:08:01.816 --> 1:08:04.486
Speak, Lord. I'm listening.

1:08:11.058 --> 1:08:13.093
I'm right here.

1:08:16.129 --> 1:08:17.465
Lord...

1:08:17.499 --> 1:08:19.734
where are you?

1:08:20.668 --> 1:08:24.572
I don't know where
to find you right now.

1:08:48.262 --> 1:08:50.297
Thank you.

1:09:15.790 --> 1:09:18.358
<i>Doug, I'm here in Tehran.</i>

1:09:18.392 --> 1:09:19.794
<i>I know where you are.</i>

1:09:19.827 --> 1:09:22.597
<i>I'm letting the world know
so they'll let you go.</i>

1:09:22.630 --> 1:09:24.832
<i>I know you're alive, Doug.</i>

1:09:24.866 --> 1:09:26.568
<i>I'll come for you soon.</i>

1:09:26.601 --> 1:09:28.636
<i>Love, Liz.</i>

1:10:21.889 --> 1:10:23.691
You're not...
you're not going out

1:10:23.725 --> 1:10:25.627
dressed like that, are you?

1:10:26.494 --> 1:10:28.496
Half naked?

1:10:28.529 --> 1:10:30.431
Starkers?

1:10:31.499 --> 1:10:34.134
What would your husband think?

1:10:47.314 --> 1:10:48.549
Is this you?

1:10:48.583 --> 1:10:50.618
Hmm?

1:10:50.652 --> 1:10:52.854
You responsible for this?

1:10:55.523 --> 1:10:58.291
Look at me when
I'm fucking talking to you!

1:10:59.927 --> 1:11:02.229
Is this you?

1:11:05.533 --> 1:11:07.367
Get your clothes on.

1:11:36.464 --> 1:11:39.266
- What am I doing here?
- Shut up and listen to me.

1:11:39.299 --> 1:11:40.668
Tell your old man to come clean.

1:11:40.702 --> 1:11:42.302
Tell him to say
exactly what it is

1:11:42.335 --> 1:11:44.439
they want him to say,
or it's gonna end very badly.

1:11:44.472 --> 1:11:45.907
Do you understand?

1:11:45.940 --> 1:11:48.341
- Okay.
- Good girl.

1:12:02.322 --> 1:12:03.725
Doug.

1:12:03.758 --> 1:12:05.560
What have they done to you?

1:12:05.593 --> 1:12:06.828
You bastards.

1:12:06.861 --> 1:12:08.328
What have they done to him?

1:12:08.361 --> 1:12:10.363
- Ah, he looks lovely.
- Look at him.

1:12:10.397 --> 1:12:11.933
- He can barely walk.
- Shh.

1:12:11.966 --> 1:12:13.768
- It's all right.
- Doug, I'm sorry.

1:12:13.801 --> 1:12:15.368
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, too,

1:12:15.403 --> 1:12:17.472
- but you shouldn't have come.
- I'm sorry.

1:12:21.976 --> 1:12:23.644
We have a chance.

1:12:23.678 --> 1:12:24.812
That's enough. That's a lot.

1:12:24.846 --> 1:12:26.447
Sit down, please.

1:12:26.481 --> 1:12:27.849
Get comfy.

1:12:32.987 --> 1:12:34.956
Are you okay?

1:12:36.389 --> 1:12:39.427
Smile for the cameras.
Smile for the cameras.

1:12:40.495 --> 1:12:43.698
I apologize, honey,
for all of it.

1:12:43.731 --> 1:12:44.799
My ego was on overdrive,

1:12:44.832 --> 1:12:46.000
thinking I could save the world.

1:12:46.033 --> 1:12:47.535
You were invited.

1:12:47.568 --> 1:12:50.370
No, I was stupid,
selfish, prideful.

1:12:50.404 --> 1:12:51.939
- No, you weren't.
- I blew it.

1:12:51.973 --> 1:12:53.373
This is what you do.

1:12:53.407 --> 1:12:54.909
- You-you talk to people.
- I know.

1:12:54.942 --> 1:12:56.978
- You exchange ideas.
- Dumb ideas.

1:12:57.011 --> 1:12:59.080
Yeah, it is.
It's stupid sometimes.

1:12:59.113 --> 1:13:00.982
It's...

1:13:01.015 --> 1:13:03.383
I want more time with him.

1:13:03.417 --> 1:13:04.852
Where are you taking her?

1:13:04.886 --> 1:13:06.454
It's all right, mate.
She's just going to the hotel.

1:13:06.487 --> 1:13:07.889
- Where are you taking her?
- She'll be fine.

1:13:07.922 --> 1:13:09.490
Liz, get out.
You got to get out of here.

1:13:09.524 --> 1:13:10.925
- No, not unless you come with me.
- Liz, listen to me.

1:13:10.958 --> 1:13:12.426
Get out of here today.

1:13:12.460 --> 1:13:13.728
- Not unless you come with me.
- Come on.

1:13:13.761 --> 1:13:14.762
- Get out of here.
- Not unless...

1:13:14.796 --> 1:13:15.763
You have to leave this country.

1:13:15.797 --> 1:13:17.364
Not unless you come with me.

1:13:17.397 --> 1:13:19.567
Whoa, whoa.

1:13:19.600 --> 1:13:21.869
Hey, hey, hey.

1:13:24.005 --> 1:13:26.306
Mr. Rawlins.

1:13:27.475 --> 1:13:29.510
Welcome to Iran.

1:13:33.014 --> 1:13:35.616
We're putting you on trial.

1:13:35.650 --> 1:13:37.384
What for?

1:13:38.085 --> 1:13:40.054
We're announcing to the world

1:13:40.087 --> 1:13:42.957
your appearance in Cairo
was a pretext

1:13:42.990 --> 1:13:44.992
for spying activities.

1:13:45.026 --> 1:13:47.795
The evidence is overwhelming.

1:13:47.829 --> 1:13:50.665
We have excellent witnesses.

1:13:50.698 --> 1:13:52.533
I'm sure you do.

1:13:52.567 --> 1:13:55.069
We're going to broadcast
the trial.

1:13:55.102 --> 1:13:57.839
The world will see
how guilty you are,

1:13:57.872 --> 1:14:03.010
as will the Christians in Iran
who need a lesson in manners.

1:14:06.914 --> 1:14:09.450
You will confess
before the cameras.

1:14:31.038 --> 1:14:33.407
Let's keep it moving, shall we?

1:15:08.242 --> 1:15:10.044
Javid!

1:15:10.912 --> 1:15:12.780
Javid!

1:15:12.813 --> 1:15:14.882
You know what's happened
to Doug.

1:15:14.916 --> 1:15:15.950
You know he's innocent.

1:15:15.983 --> 1:15:17.084
You-you can tell them the truth.

1:15:17.118 --> 1:15:18.119
You're his friend.

1:15:18.152 --> 1:15:20.588
Yeah, that's why I'm here, Liz.

1:15:20.621 --> 1:15:22.156
To testify.

1:15:22.990 --> 1:15:24.492
Testify?

1:15:24.525 --> 1:15:26.494
At his trial.

1:15:27.929 --> 1:15:29.931
I'm their primary witness.

1:15:29.964 --> 1:15:31.699
For the Iranian government?

1:15:31.732 --> 1:15:34.201
For my government.

1:15:35.670 --> 1:15:38.105
But at least you know
how to say "Iran" now.

1:15:38.139 --> 1:15:39.941
Not "I-ran."

1:15:41.809 --> 1:15:43.177
You Americans.

1:15:43.210 --> 1:15:44.979
Spend decades
in the Middle East,

1:15:45.012 --> 1:15:46.847
and you say "I-ran" and "I-raq."

1:15:46.881 --> 1:15:47.982
What is this?

1:15:48.015 --> 1:15:50.251
Intentional stupidity?

1:15:50.284 --> 1:15:53.187
No, seriously,
I really want to know.

1:15:53.220 --> 1:15:56.023
'Cause you act as if
nothing happened in Virginia.

1:15:56.057 --> 1:15:57.591
What?

1:15:57.625 --> 1:15:59.560
You tried to get me
arrested there.

1:15:59.593 --> 1:16:02.563
No. No, no, no, that's not true.

1:16:04.932 --> 1:16:07.234
Where is Soheila?
Where is Meena?

1:16:10.871 --> 1:16:12.106
My wife is here.

1:16:12.139 --> 1:16:13.274
And she doesn't leave the house,

1:16:13.307 --> 1:16:15.509
like it should have been
in America.

1:16:16.644 --> 1:16:18.879
Then none of this
would have happened.

1:16:18.913 --> 1:16:21.115
And Meena?

1:16:22.049 --> 1:16:24.018
I don't know that name.

1:16:24.051 --> 1:16:26.053
She's your daughter.

1:16:26.087 --> 1:16:29.757
I have no daughter.

1:16:29.790 --> 1:16:32.259
Why? Because of that boy?

1:16:32.293 --> 1:16:33.694
No.

1:16:36.063 --> 1:16:38.165
Because of her shame.

1:16:42.903 --> 1:16:45.039
I had no choice.

1:16:56.350 --> 1:16:58.819
Did you get what you needed?

1:16:58.853 --> 1:17:00.821
Shit.

1:17:00.855 --> 1:17:03.224
<i>We're here to render judgment</i>

1:17:03.257 --> 1:17:05.926
<i>in the case
of Mr. Douglas Rawlins</i>

1:17:05.960 --> 1:17:07.862
<i>for the charge of spying
against Iranians</i>

1:17:07.895 --> 1:17:09.864
<i>in America, Egypt</i>

1:17:09.897 --> 1:17:12.099
and Lebanon.

1:17:12.133 --> 1:17:14.001
Mr. Rawlins,

1:17:14.035 --> 1:17:16.237
you have been remanded
in custody,

1:17:16.270 --> 1:17:18.706
and you must face justice.

1:17:18.739 --> 1:17:19.907
Justice?

1:17:19.940 --> 1:17:21.776
- Justice?
- Justice!

1:17:21.809 --> 1:17:23.177
I've been kidnapped.

1:17:23.210 --> 1:17:25.746
I have been beaten.
I've been tortured, threatened.

1:17:25.780 --> 1:17:27.214
By your men.

1:17:27.248 --> 1:17:28.816
Deprived of all
my civil liberties.

1:17:28.849 --> 1:17:31.685
Now, you're gonna do
what you damn well please,

1:17:31.719 --> 1:17:33.954
but don't decorate
your brutality

1:17:33.988 --> 1:17:36.057
with legal and divine fiction.

1:17:37.391 --> 1:17:39.960
The evidence thus far

1:17:39.994 --> 1:17:41.629
is most compelling,

1:17:41.662 --> 1:17:44.298
but we demand to hear it
from your mouth:

1:17:44.331 --> 1:17:46.133
Are you a spy?

1:17:46.167 --> 1:17:48.369
I am not a spy, sir.

1:17:48.403 --> 1:17:50.638
You work in Washington, D.C.

1:17:50.671 --> 1:17:52.973
You have government contracts.

1:17:53.007 --> 1:17:55.643
You have clearance.

1:17:55.676 --> 1:18:01.649
And yet you deny any
spying activity whatsoever?

1:18:01.682 --> 1:18:02.817
Yes, sir.

1:18:02.850 --> 1:18:04.652
I deny it.

1:18:38.352 --> 1:18:40.287
Your name, please.

1:18:40.321 --> 1:18:41.689
Javid Hosseini.

1:18:41.722 --> 1:18:44.191
Tell us how you know
the defendant.

1:18:44.225 --> 1:18:45.926
I worked side by side
with Mr. Rawlins

1:18:45.960 --> 1:18:49.663
in a software company in Fairfax
called Innovative Solutions.

1:18:49.697 --> 1:18:51.699
Innovative Solutions was engaged

1:18:51.732 --> 1:18:54.101
in contracts
with the U.S. government,

1:18:54.135 --> 1:18:59.940
and Doug was actually doing
classified research,

1:18:59.974 --> 1:19:02.444
most of which was about Iran.

1:19:02.477 --> 1:19:05.279
And I've brought
some of it here today.

1:19:23.164 --> 1:19:24.298
That's bullshit.

1:19:24.331 --> 1:19:25.699
Mr. Abolhassan.

1:19:25.733 --> 1:19:28.269
- Mr. Rawlins, please.
- Bullshit.

1:19:28.302 --> 1:19:30.371
Silence!

1:19:35.943 --> 1:19:37.945
You may continue.

1:19:37.978 --> 1:19:39.947
So, looking further
into the matter,

1:19:39.980 --> 1:19:43.485
it became clear to me
that Mr. Douglas

1:19:43.518 --> 1:19:46.353
and the whole company
was engaged

1:19:46.387 --> 1:19:48.989
in spying activities
against my country,

1:19:49.023 --> 1:19:54.261
and I, as a patriot...
I had to act even if it put

1:19:54.295 --> 1:19:56.464
- me and my family in danger.
- Patriot?

1:19:56.498 --> 1:20:00.801
'Cause this is what
noble citizens do.

1:20:00.834 --> 1:20:01.936
You're a coward.

1:20:03.471 --> 1:20:05.940
Suddenly, the police
are invading my house.

1:20:05.973 --> 1:20:08.075
They-they went
through the whole house.

1:20:08.108 --> 1:20:09.910
Every room.

1:20:09.944 --> 1:20:14.315
Trying to prove that
I was a spy against America.

1:20:14.348 --> 1:20:16.484
All of the neighbors
were watching.

1:20:16.518 --> 1:20:19.421
It was extremely humiliating.

1:20:25.192 --> 1:20:27.429
My daughter...

1:20:32.099 --> 1:20:35.236
My daughter committed suicide

1:20:35.269 --> 1:20:38.038
from the shame
they caused us that day.

1:20:39.407 --> 1:20:41.875
You whacked your own kid.

1:20:42.577 --> 1:20:44.945
No, you killed her.

1:20:44.979 --> 1:20:47.248
And now I just want...
I just want

1:20:47.281 --> 1:20:48.949
the world to know that this is

1:20:48.983 --> 1:20:50.851
th-the man that killed
my small...

1:20:50.884 --> 1:20:54.088
my little angel,
my little daughter.

1:20:54.121 --> 1:20:56.090
You're crying
'cause of your guilt.

1:20:57.825 --> 1:20:59.860
M-Meena's dead
because of you and Liz.

1:20:59.893 --> 1:21:03.264
I just want justice
for my daughter.

1:21:03.297 --> 1:21:04.798
Nothing more.

1:21:04.832 --> 1:21:06.233
So much guilt.

1:21:06.267 --> 1:21:08.836
She was the only thing I had.

1:21:10.237 --> 1:21:12.440
Will the defendant rise?

1:21:14.442 --> 1:21:18.345
The court has no choice
but to rule in this case.

1:21:18.379 --> 1:21:21.282
The evidence is sufficient.

1:21:21.315 --> 1:21:23.017
It's overwhelming.

1:21:23.050 --> 1:21:28.055
It is clear you are
an American spy.

1:21:28.088 --> 1:21:30.357
Mr. Douglas Rawlins,

1:21:30.391 --> 1:21:33.827
the verdict upon you is guilty,

1:21:33.861 --> 1:21:37.998
and the sentence is death
by firing squad.

1:21:38.032 --> 1:21:39.300
Inshallah!

1:21:39.333 --> 1:21:40.535
- Allahu Akbar!
- Allahu Akbar!

1:21:42.870 --> 1:21:45.372
Mrs. Rawlins. Mrs. Rawlins.

1:21:46.974 --> 1:21:49.143
- Honey, listen to me.
- Oh, my God.

1:21:49.176 --> 1:21:50.911
Listen to me. Listen.

1:21:50.944 --> 1:21:52.980
Don't stick around
for any more of this.

1:21:53.013 --> 1:21:54.148
You have to go.

1:21:54.181 --> 1:21:56.116
No, I want to stay with you.

1:22:00.020 --> 1:22:02.122
Excuse me, um...

1:22:03.991 --> 1:22:07.995
The grand inquisitor, uh,
wishes a word.

1:22:14.201 --> 1:22:16.571
Mr. Douglas, Mrs. Rawlins,

1:22:16.604 --> 1:22:18.606
it is not too late.

1:22:19.507 --> 1:22:21.342
Too... too late for what?

1:22:21.375 --> 1:22:23.445
We can make an agreement.

1:22:23.478 --> 1:22:25.580
What are you talking about?

1:22:25.613 --> 1:22:28.115
You can escape the death penalty

1:22:28.148 --> 1:22:31.151
by making a full confession
on video.

1:22:33.588 --> 1:22:36.290
Everyone will know
it's under duress.

1:22:36.323 --> 1:22:38.560
All the better reason.

1:22:38.593 --> 1:22:41.362
You have nothing to lose

1:22:41.395 --> 1:22:43.631
and your life to gain.

1:22:55.142 --> 1:22:56.544
No way.

1:22:57.412 --> 1:22:59.079
No way.

1:23:00.247 --> 1:23:04.218
Now that we're done with that,
my wife needs to go home,

1:23:04.251 --> 1:23:06.454
and I'd like to spend
a few minutes with her.

1:23:06.488 --> 1:23:08.956
If you don't mind.

1:23:26.608 --> 1:23:28.543
This is it.

1:23:29.376 --> 1:23:31.713
I need you to go home.

1:23:31.746 --> 1:23:34.582
No, no, I didn't come here
to watch you die

1:23:34.616 --> 1:23:36.651
and go home alone. No.

1:23:37.317 --> 1:23:40.422
You will never do
what I ask, will you?

1:23:41.656 --> 1:23:43.691
And break a habit?

1:23:54.436 --> 1:23:56.471
Goodbye.

1:23:57.472 --> 1:24:00.040
- No.
- Okay.

1:25:07.475 --> 1:25:09.511
Nice day, innit?

1:25:11.311 --> 1:25:14.716
I mean, if it has to be a day,
might as well be a nice one.

1:25:16.584 --> 1:25:19.052
You know I'm just
following orders, right?

1:25:19.687 --> 1:25:21.756
This wasn't my idea.

1:25:24.592 --> 1:25:26.761
Sure.

1:25:27.462 --> 1:25:29.664
Anything else I can do for you?

1:25:29.697 --> 1:25:31.666
I don't know.

1:25:31.699 --> 1:25:33.768
Maybe a...

1:25:33.801 --> 1:25:36.303
a bulletproof vest?

1:25:45.345 --> 1:25:47.347
Repent, brother.

1:25:47.381 --> 1:25:48.716
Accept Allah's word

1:25:48.750 --> 1:25:51.251
and proclaim Muhammad
as his messenger.

1:25:56.424 --> 1:25:58.459
Should've spoken to you more
about martyrdom.

1:25:58.493 --> 1:26:01.094
If I had, you'd be laughing
at these fuckers.

1:26:01.128 --> 1:26:04.231
You'd be saying, "Through you,
I gain entrance into paradise."

1:26:07.869 --> 1:26:09.704
We're not afraid to die.

1:26:11.138 --> 1:26:13.841
That's why we're gonna win.

1:26:16.611 --> 1:26:18.746
I'm not afraid, either.

1:26:20.347 --> 1:26:22.483
Do your job.

1:26:43.771 --> 1:26:46.139
I am so proud of you.

1:26:46.173 --> 1:26:49.677
You did not shit your pants,
did you?

1:26:50.745 --> 1:26:52.714
You guys are assholes.

1:26:52.747 --> 1:26:54.616
Yep.

1:27:18.238 --> 1:27:20.441
- Hello?
- Liz, it's Maria.

1:27:20.475 --> 1:27:21.843
- They're coming for you.
- Maria?

1:27:21.876 --> 1:27:24.211
Get out now. We're outside.

1:27:27.347 --> 1:27:28.315
Come on! Come on!

1:27:28.348 --> 1:27:29.851
Hurry up!

1:27:32.420 --> 1:27:34.321
Come on, come on, come on.

1:27:39.727 --> 1:27:42.362
What's this?
What's going on?

1:27:42.396 --> 1:27:43.598
Watch it!

1:27:48.970 --> 1:27:50.772
Down!
Down, down, down, down, down!

1:27:50.805 --> 1:27:52.305
Stay down.

1:27:54.409 --> 1:27:55.610
Who are they?

1:27:55.643 --> 1:27:56.644
Local militia. Who knows?

1:27:56.678 --> 1:27:59.714
You're a trophy now, Liz.

1:28:01.015 --> 1:28:03.484
We're clear now.
Go, go, go, go, go.

1:28:23.336 --> 1:28:24.839
What's this?

1:28:24.872 --> 1:28:26.974
Are these guys with you?

1:28:27.008 --> 1:28:28.876
What-what's going on?

1:28:29.610 --> 1:28:32.780
We have men on the inside
of Prison 209.

1:28:32.814 --> 1:28:34.649
People that you've met.

1:28:34.682 --> 1:28:36.517
We've been preparing something.

1:28:36.551 --> 1:28:37.985
A rescue.

1:28:38.920 --> 1:28:41.354
A rescue for Doug?

1:28:41.388 --> 1:28:42.322
Are you with us?

1:28:42.355 --> 1:28:45.258
I want to get Doug out,
of course, but I...

1:28:45.292 --> 1:28:48.295
I need to know who you are.

1:28:49.630 --> 1:28:52.433
- We are Mossad.
- Mossad?

1:28:52.467 --> 1:28:54.535
Oh, shit.

1:28:54.569 --> 1:28:58.473
Why would Israeli intelligence
care about Doug?

1:28:58.506 --> 1:29:02.977
We have two men... Iranians...
being held in 209.

1:29:03.010 --> 1:29:04.579
Doug has met them.

1:29:04.612 --> 1:29:06.514
We want to get them out,
and in the process,

1:29:06.547 --> 1:29:07.749
we'll rescue Doug.

1:29:07.782 --> 1:29:10.518
That way, his rescue
becomes our cover.

1:29:10.551 --> 1:29:12.653
So, Doug and I are your front?

1:29:12.687 --> 1:29:14.321
No.

1:29:15.423 --> 1:29:17.290
Look.

1:29:18.659 --> 1:29:20.828
I'm gonna tell you something.

1:29:20.862 --> 1:29:24.766
If you ever repeat it,
I'll deny it.

1:29:24.799 --> 1:29:27.300
The United States government
is aware of

1:29:27.334 --> 1:29:29.771
and fully supports this action.

1:29:37.078 --> 1:29:41.082
So... so, you want me to go
into that prison?

1:29:41.115 --> 1:29:41.983
Yes.

1:29:42.016 --> 1:29:43.417
Why would they let me in?

1:29:43.451 --> 1:29:44.819
Because you're gonna tell them

1:29:44.852 --> 1:29:46.921
that you're gonna
convince Doug to confess

1:29:46.954 --> 1:29:48.823
in order to save his life.

1:29:48.856 --> 1:29:52.026
If we may find a moment
when he will be with you

1:29:52.059 --> 1:29:56.063
inside of the visitors room,
we can finally move.

1:29:56.097 --> 1:29:59.901
Without you, all it is
is conversation.

1:30:09.010 --> 1:30:10.945
What do you need me to do?

1:30:10.978 --> 1:30:13.981
You'll stay here tonight
with Maria.

1:30:14.015 --> 1:30:15.583
It's safe.

1:30:15.616 --> 1:30:17.051
Tomorrow, we move.

1:30:17.885 --> 1:30:19.720
<i>It's visitors day.</i>

1:30:19.754 --> 1:30:22.355
<i>There'll be a mob
at the main gate.</i>

1:30:22.389 --> 1:30:24.492
<i>Some are our people.</i>

1:30:24.525 --> 1:30:27.929
<i>The rest are Muslim women
who want their men out.</i>

1:30:27.962 --> 1:30:29.530
Uh, Liz Rawlins.

1:30:29.564 --> 1:30:30.965
<i>The coronavirus has spread</i>

1:30:30.998 --> 1:30:32.066
<i>through the prison.</i>

1:30:32.099 --> 1:30:34.669
<i>The inmates, they want out, to.</i>

1:30:37.171 --> 1:30:39.707
<i>This is a political prison.</i>

1:30:39.740 --> 1:30:42.577
<i>Only guards in the towers
have firearms.</i>

1:30:42.610 --> 1:30:45.378
<i>We're planning a diversion
to mask their ability to see,</i>

1:30:45.413 --> 1:30:48.416
<i>to give us time to do
what we need to do.</i>

1:30:48.449 --> 1:30:50.651
<i>Guards on the ground
in the cellblocks</i>

1:30:50.685 --> 1:30:51.919
<i>only have nightsticks.</i>

1:30:51.953 --> 1:30:53.487
<i>We can pull this off,</i>

1:30:53.521 --> 1:30:56.924
<i>but you have to do
exactly as I say.</i>

1:30:56.958 --> 1:30:58.860
Get my boy to confess.

1:30:58.893 --> 1:31:01.495
Do you ever shut up?

1:31:43.170 --> 1:31:45.139
What are you still doing here?

1:31:45.172 --> 1:31:48.509
- Sit down, Doug.
- I told you to leave, damn it.

1:31:48.542 --> 1:31:49.710
- Back to my cell, please.
- Doug. Doug!

1:31:49.744 --> 1:31:51.012
- No.
- Doug.

1:31:51.045 --> 1:31:52.747
- What?
- Sit down.

1:31:52.780 --> 1:31:55.082
Why are you here?

1:31:57.118 --> 1:32:00.021
We're getting out of here.

1:32:03.524 --> 1:32:05.493
What?

1:32:06.160 --> 1:32:08.029
It's gonna be okay.

1:32:39.126 --> 1:32:41.629
Come on! Come on!

1:33:37.985 --> 1:33:39.820
Sit down!

1:33:39.854 --> 1:33:41.122
- Sit down!
- What was that?

1:34:51.926 --> 1:34:52.993
Come here.

1:34:53.027 --> 1:34:54.728
Quickly.

1:35:13.781 --> 1:35:15.216
Go, go, go, go!

1:35:15.249 --> 1:35:17.852
Open the gate! Open the gate!

1:35:20.254 --> 1:35:22.289
Get out! Come on!

1:35:22.323 --> 1:35:24.125
Come on, come on!

1:35:36.070 --> 1:35:38.005
Get out, guys! Come on!

1:36:46.106 --> 1:36:47.975
Come now.

1:36:56.551 --> 1:36:58.118
- We're with you.
- Good.

1:36:58.152 --> 1:37:00.754
- Let's go.
- Please.

1:37:41.429 --> 1:37:43.431
Is there a plan here,
or are we winging it?

1:37:43.465 --> 1:37:45.299
We're winging it.

1:38:02.249 --> 1:38:03.951
Magid!

1:38:06.253 --> 1:38:08.322
Come on. In the van.
In the van. In the van!

1:38:08.355 --> 1:38:10.525
- Come on!
- Dawood! Hamid! Come on!

1:38:10.558 --> 1:38:13.260
Come on! Here, come on!

1:38:14.128 --> 1:38:15.563
Yes, come on! Here!

1:38:20.568 --> 1:38:23.037
Go, go, go, go, go!

1:38:40.988 --> 1:38:42.557
Hey!

1:38:50.030 --> 1:38:52.166
Go!

1:38:58.406 --> 1:38:59.873
How are we getting out
of the country?

1:38:59.907 --> 1:39:01.308
Two helicopters.

1:39:01.342 --> 1:39:03.578
One out of the city,
another waiting in the desert.

1:39:03.611 --> 1:39:05.480
- What about your people?
- What about 'em?

1:39:05.513 --> 1:39:07.348
They're going another route.

1:39:10.685 --> 1:39:12.554
They're behind us.

1:39:12.587 --> 1:39:14.556
Damn it. Go, go, go!

1:39:30.638 --> 1:39:32.106
Stop!

1:39:38.045 --> 1:39:39.380
- What's this?
- Underground caves.

1:39:39.414 --> 1:39:41.048
Go now!

1:39:44.486 --> 1:39:46.120
Come on, Liz.

1:39:48.989 --> 1:39:50.991
- Liz!
- Back to the van now!

1:39:59.366 --> 1:40:01.135
- My wife!
- There's no going back!

1:40:02.404 --> 1:40:04.406
- You know what to do.
- Yeah.

1:40:05.305 --> 1:40:07.141
Go, go, go, go, go!

1:40:10.210 --> 1:40:11.513
Go!

1:41:04.264 --> 1:41:05.533
Is Doug here?

1:41:05.567 --> 1:41:07.334
Where's Pierre?

1:41:07.367 --> 1:41:09.604
He-he didn't make it.

1:41:11.406 --> 1:41:13.240
What about Doug?

1:41:13.273 --> 1:41:15.108
I'm not sure.

1:41:35.095 --> 1:41:36.498
That helicopter is leaving,

1:41:36.531 --> 1:41:38.733
and it's my job
to put you on it!

1:41:38.766 --> 1:41:41.101
- I'm not going without Doug.
- Come on!

1:41:41.836 --> 1:41:43.103
Go!

1:41:44.772 --> 1:41:46.808
Please, Liz, it's my job
to save your life.

1:41:46.841 --> 1:41:48.409
Doug! Doug.

1:41:49.844 --> 1:41:51.613
Come on!

1:41:51.646 --> 1:41:52.714
- Oh, thank God.
- Thank God.

1:41:52.747 --> 1:41:54.181
We made it.

1:41:54.214 --> 1:41:56.116
- You okay?
- You're here.

1:41:56.851 --> 1:41:58.318
Jeep!

1:41:59.621 --> 1:42:01.623
- Go! Go!
- Stay down! Stay down!

1:42:37.391 --> 1:42:39.092
- Liz!
- Doug.

1:42:40.260 --> 1:42:41.863
Doug.

1:42:41.896 --> 1:42:44.632
Come with me! Liz!

1:43:00.515 --> 1:43:03.451
You take this shit
too seriously, mate.

1:43:57.438 --> 1:43:58.773
Let's go.

1:43:58.806 --> 1:44:00.173
Let's go. Come on!

1:44:00.207 --> 1:44:02.142
Come on, honey! Come on!

1:44:02.777 --> 1:44:04.144
Get in.

1:44:40.581 --> 1:44:42.717
<i>There's reports
from the Middle East</i>

1:44:42.750 --> 1:44:44.452
<i>that American Doug Rawlins,</i>

1:44:44.485 --> 1:44:47.555
<i>recently sentenced to death by
the Islamic Republic of Iran,</i>

1:44:47.588 --> 1:44:50.491
<i>has escaped the country
in a mass prison break.</i>

1:44:50.525 --> 1:44:52.727
<i>We're cutting now
to a press conference,</i>

1:44:52.760 --> 1:44:54.929
<i>we believe from Amman, Jordan.</i>
