WEBVTT

00:01.436 --> 00:01.653
.

00:03.873 --> 00:04.917
Her dad got himself in a mess
with painkillers.

00:04.961 --> 00:06.049
She's a good kid.

00:06.093 --> 00:08.051
- The deputy commissioner
asked me

00:08.095 --> 00:11.185
for my ideas
about a replacement

00:11.228 --> 00:13.056
once I ride off
into the sunset.

00:13.100 --> 00:15.015
Then I told him,
Wallace Boden.

00:15.058 --> 00:16.364
- Deputy district chief.

00:16.407 --> 00:18.061
Damn,
that's a big promotion.

00:18.105 --> 00:19.715
- If I don't get
my clearance this week,

00:19.758 --> 00:21.108
I plan to step aside.

00:21.151 --> 00:22.979
- Go to your assessment,
get your results,

00:23.023 --> 00:24.937
take it from there.

00:24.981 --> 00:27.940
- Yeah.

00:27.984 --> 00:30.378
I'm ready.

00:49.223 --> 00:51.007
If it's bad news,
don't stall, Dr. Mayberry.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.139
Just tell it to me
like it is.

00:52.182 --> 00:54.054
- It's not.

00:54.097 --> 00:57.796
You are clear
to return to active duty.

01:03.106 --> 01:05.021
Yeah!

01:10.592 --> 01:15.205
- Okay, so before we begin
this morning's briefing

01:15.249 --> 01:17.860
and before we officially
welcome Otis back

01:17.903 --> 01:19.514
to his spot on Truck 81...

01:21.124 --> 01:24.388
- Otis.
- Whoo--whoo!

01:24.432 --> 01:26.086
- I understand
that Captain Casey

01:26.129 --> 01:27.348
would like to say a few words.

01:27.391 --> 01:29.219
- Yes, I would.

01:29.263 --> 01:30.960
I would, actually.

01:31.003 --> 01:32.744
A lot of thought
and consideration

01:32.788 --> 01:34.790
go into honoring
those in our firehouse

01:34.833 --> 01:38.663
who struggle
to overcome impossible odds.

01:38.707 --> 01:44.408
To earn a place of respect
on any wall here at 51, well...

01:44.452 --> 01:48.325
That is only reserved
for the strongest among us...

01:48.369 --> 01:52.112
which is why
we would like to recognize

01:52.155 --> 01:55.158
Otis' cane.

01:55.202 --> 01:57.595
She bent,
but she never broke.

01:57.639 --> 02:00.816
She fell,
but she never stayed down.

02:00.859 --> 02:03.123
She had to endure palm sweat
that no object

02:03.166 --> 02:06.430
on this planet should be
subjected to.

02:06.474 --> 02:10.652
To Otis' cane.

02:12.436 --> 02:14.569
- Welcome back, buddy.
- Thanks.

02:14.612 --> 02:17.311
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

02:17.354 --> 02:20.140
Chief Grissom.

02:20.183 --> 02:21.967
- Wallace.

02:22.011 --> 02:23.447
- Nice surprise.

02:23.491 --> 02:25.710
- You might change
your mind when you hear

02:25.754 --> 02:27.364
what I have to say.

02:27.408 --> 02:30.976
I came here a while ago,
got your hopes up about

02:31.020 --> 02:32.543
a promotion.

02:32.587 --> 02:35.720
Chance to fill my shoes
once I step aside.

02:35.764 --> 02:37.548
- But...

02:37.592 --> 02:41.683
- But I've decided not
to step aside.

02:43.859 --> 02:45.382
- I see.

02:45.426 --> 02:46.992
- You remember
that scaffolding incident

02:47.036 --> 02:49.952
Severide and I went up and
pulled that kid to safety?

02:49.995 --> 02:52.476
- Yeah, good save.

02:54.478 --> 02:56.263
- That was
the first time in a while

02:56.306 --> 02:58.265
that I got my hands dirty.

02:58.308 --> 03:00.484
Nice reminder of...

03:00.528 --> 03:03.792
Why I got into this life
in the first place.

03:03.835 --> 03:07.143
I got blinded there
for a bit by all the paperwork

03:07.187 --> 03:09.232
and policy meetings,
but I realize now

03:09.276 --> 03:11.321
that I've still
got more to give.

03:11.365 --> 03:14.890
And I want to give it.

03:15.847 --> 03:20.939
So, I'm putting
my retirement on hold.

03:22.027 --> 03:25.205
- Hmm.

03:25.988 --> 03:27.555
- Anyway...

03:27.598 --> 03:31.080
I just wanted you
to hear that from me.

03:32.821 --> 03:35.737
- Squad 3, pin-in accident.
24 North Green Street.

03:35.780 --> 03:38.783
- I better go get
my hands dirty myself.

03:38.827 --> 03:41.743
- Do your thing.

03:41.786 --> 03:44.572
- Yeah.

04:06.898 --> 04:08.900
- Looks like
a single vehicle accident,

04:08.944 --> 04:10.641
best I can tell.

04:14.428 --> 04:17.300
- Hey!
Hey, sir!

04:17.344 --> 04:19.171
You okay?

04:19.215 --> 04:21.217
- Capp, grab a ladder.
- Copy.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.306
- I saw the whole thing
from up there.

04:23.350 --> 04:24.612
He hit someone.

04:24.655 --> 04:26.570
- He was going too fast,

04:26.614 --> 04:28.877
swerved into some woman
walking in the street,

04:28.920 --> 04:31.053
but he hit her.

04:44.458 --> 04:47.852
- Come on.
Come on, there.

04:47.896 --> 04:50.028
- Hey, Tony,
give me a hand here.

04:50.072 --> 04:51.726
- Yeah.

04:53.336 --> 04:54.859
- Come on...

04:54.903 --> 04:57.297
- Hey, hey, buddy.

04:57.340 --> 04:58.994
How you doing?
- I didn't see her.

04:59.037 --> 05:01.257
- It's okay, it's all right.
Just don't move your neck.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.693
Capp, I need a c-collar.

05:02.737 --> 05:05.783
- Copy that!
- Come on...

05:05.827 --> 05:08.699
Come on.
Come on.

05:08.743 --> 05:11.485
both:

05:11.528 --> 05:13.138
- One, two.

05:13.182 --> 05:15.880
Okay!

05:16.664 --> 05:18.927
- She's not breathing.
I think her leg's snapped.

05:18.970 --> 05:21.408
- Let's get her
to the sidewalk.

05:21.451 --> 05:24.149
- Tony! Grab any water
you can from the rig.

05:24.193 --> 05:26.108
- Got it!

05:26.151 --> 05:28.110
- Okay.

05:28.153 --> 05:33.333
- All right, coming in, buddy.

05:33.376 --> 05:35.944
- Come on. Come on now.
- Watch your arm.

05:35.987 --> 05:37.032
- Tony!

05:37.075 --> 05:38.686
- Breathe for me.

05:38.729 --> 05:39.817
Come on now.

05:39.861 --> 05:41.036
Come on.

05:41.079 --> 05:44.953
It's in her mouth.
Can't get it in there.

05:44.996 --> 05:47.738
Come on, get in there...

05:51.351 --> 05:53.135
Come on!

05:53.178 --> 05:56.791
Come on, breathe for me.

05:56.834 --> 05:59.141
Breathe.

06:00.447 --> 06:02.274
Where's ambo?

06:06.714 --> 06:10.065
- Stoltz!

06:12.154 --> 06:14.852
- Breathe for me, come on.

06:16.767 --> 06:18.639
- She got a face
full of concrete.

06:18.682 --> 06:20.292
I think she's got
a broken leg, too.

06:20.336 --> 06:23.121
- Get in here!

06:30.433 --> 06:33.436
Come on...

06:36.787 --> 06:38.746
- There we go, there we go.

06:38.789 --> 06:41.749
- Okay, okay, we got you.

06:56.111 --> 06:58.635
- Had a wake-up call
this morning.

07:08.906 --> 07:10.647
- Hey, Otis,
talked to Herrmann

07:10.691 --> 07:12.040
and we're going to handle
the cooking

07:12.083 --> 07:14.259
till you get your legs
back under you.

07:14.303 --> 07:16.479
I didn't...

07:16.523 --> 07:19.221
I-I-I didn't--
- It's cool.

07:19.264 --> 07:20.483
- All right, look,

07:20.527 --> 07:22.703
I got to say one thing,
all right?

07:22.746 --> 07:25.183
The food bill
has definitely gone down

07:25.227 --> 07:28.448
since we got rid of
that Cordova giant.

07:28.491 --> 07:29.884
- We didn't get rid of anyone.

07:29.927 --> 07:31.581
We just kept Otis' seat warm.

07:31.625 --> 07:34.889
- Appreciate that, captain.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.414
- So, I would like to be

07:38.458 --> 07:43.114
up front and above board
with everyone.

07:43.158 --> 07:46.901
I want to
keep driving the truck.

07:50.687 --> 07:53.429
- Okay, I'll bite.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.475
What's the punch line?

07:55.518 --> 07:57.781
- It's not a joke.

07:57.825 --> 07:59.609
- Look, the great thing
about 51

07:59.653 --> 08:01.176
is we don't baby anybody
around here.

08:01.219 --> 08:03.961
You're cleared for duty
and that is great,

08:04.005 --> 08:06.007
but I stepped up
when you were gone.

08:06.050 --> 08:10.141
I like driving
and so I want to keep doing it.

08:10.185 --> 08:13.362
- Okay, listen...

08:13.405 --> 08:14.711
Stella makes a valid point.

08:14.755 --> 08:17.758
- Captain!
- She does.

08:17.801 --> 08:19.673
Way I see it...

08:19.716 --> 08:21.501
When I played
high school football,

08:21.544 --> 08:23.503
we had
two very good quarterbacks,

08:23.546 --> 08:25.679
Scott Schultz
and Todd Phillips.

08:25.722 --> 08:27.332
Coach used all
his spring training

08:27.376 --> 08:29.334
to figure out
who he wanted as a starter,

08:29.378 --> 08:32.729
Scott or Todd.

08:32.773 --> 08:34.514
We should set up
some spring training

08:34.557 --> 08:37.081
to see who's best
behind the wheel of 81.

08:37.125 --> 08:39.301
- Works for me.

08:40.432 --> 08:43.871
- Yeah.
Great.

08:46.787 --> 08:48.528
- Hey.
I just got this message

08:48.571 --> 08:51.182
from Bria
and she sounds really upset.

08:51.226 --> 08:52.880
- So call her.
- Well, she's not picking up.

08:52.923 --> 08:55.535
- Okay, let's not jump
to the worst conclusion.

08:55.578 --> 08:56.753
- Well, you know how
my brain works.

08:56.797 --> 08:58.450
- I do, which is why
mean to tell you

08:58.494 --> 09:00.365
to take a deep breath
and wait until you actually

09:00.409 --> 09:01.715
make contact with her.

09:01.758 --> 09:04.674
- Just everything
she's been through...

09:04.718 --> 09:06.937
- Let's not forget
she's a teenage girl.

09:06.981 --> 09:09.244
- Exactly.

09:11.246 --> 09:14.075
- Come on.

09:15.337 --> 09:18.209
- Whoa.

09:18.253 --> 09:21.125
- I just got a Facebook message
from Delia Cantor.

09:23.475 --> 09:24.999
- When they write
my life story,

09:25.042 --> 09:27.392
she is the chapter titled
"the one who got away."

09:27.436 --> 09:28.742
- I don't like biographies.

09:28.785 --> 09:30.482
- We went out
all of junior year,

09:30.526 --> 09:32.006
all of senior year.

09:32.049 --> 09:33.877
I thought we were going
to get married someday.

09:33.921 --> 09:36.532
She got a track scholarship
to Kansas; it just kind of...

09:36.576 --> 09:38.882
Trailed off after that.

09:38.926 --> 09:41.755
She went places
and I stayed here.

09:47.456 --> 09:50.459
Hey.

09:50.502 --> 09:51.721
She's married.

09:51.765 --> 09:54.419
- Yeah.
But it's still pretty cool

09:54.463 --> 09:55.769
that she reached out.

09:55.812 --> 09:57.814
I'd love to see her.
Catch up.

09:57.858 --> 10:00.774
Ask her what she's been doing
the last 20 years.

10:06.954 --> 10:09.652
- Chief.
There was a box in there

10:09.696 --> 10:12.394
of some old photos.
Think they may be yours?

10:12.437 --> 10:13.874
- Thank you, Connie.

10:13.917 --> 10:15.658
- It's a mess in there.

10:15.702 --> 10:17.878
- I appreciate you
cleaning it up.

10:45.470 --> 10:52.652
♪

11:05.621 --> 11:07.667
- Hey, Bria,
it's Gabby.

11:07.710 --> 11:10.408
Can you call me back
when you get this?

11:13.194 --> 11:14.804
- You want to run by
her apartment?

11:14.848 --> 11:17.154
- Absolutely.

11:17.198 --> 11:20.244
- Okay, yeah,
I'll--I'll tell Matt.

11:22.333 --> 11:24.727
- Mr. Jamison.

11:24.771 --> 11:26.337
- Gabby.

11:26.381 --> 11:28.339
- Bria just called me.
She left a message.

11:28.383 --> 11:29.993
- Yeah, um, about that...

11:30.037 --> 11:33.518
I need your help.
She--she needs your help.

11:33.562 --> 11:36.478
I have no idea
what to do.

11:43.703 --> 11:43.877
.

11:43.920 --> 11:46.140
- I heard Bria's dad
is here.

11:46.183 --> 11:47.663
- Well, it turns out
Bria does need my help

11:47.707 --> 11:50.622
after all, just not the help
we were worried about.

11:51.449 --> 11:54.148
- Meaning girl stuff.

11:55.540 --> 11:57.151
She called the right person,
I'll tell you that.

11:57.194 --> 11:59.849
- Why do I get the feeling
you just found a new mission?

11:59.893 --> 12:03.113
- 'Cause I did.

12:03.157 --> 12:04.724
- Just wondering
if anyone's inspected

12:04.767 --> 12:07.596
the inside rear tire
since I've been gone.

12:07.639 --> 12:09.685
Pretty standard.
Something every driver

12:09.729 --> 12:12.601
should know how to do
in case, I don't know,

12:12.644 --> 12:15.125
a rock gets wedged in there
or something.

12:15.169 --> 12:16.605
Pretty dangerous.

12:16.648 --> 12:19.521
- You know, it's funny,
when I stepped into

12:19.564 --> 12:20.914
driving duties
at a moment's notice

12:20.957 --> 12:23.133
and was well prepared
and totally ready,

12:23.177 --> 12:25.179
I noticed that many
of the lug nuts

12:25.222 --> 12:27.703
on the left side
of 81 were loose.

12:27.747 --> 12:30.184
And while that is certainly
careless of the previous driver

12:30.227 --> 12:31.707
I didn't judge.

12:31.751 --> 12:35.319
I just went around
and tightened everything up.

12:36.799 --> 12:38.453
- Just pointing out
that service has been

12:38.496 --> 12:40.324
slipping a bit since
I've been absent.

12:40.368 --> 12:42.762
- And I am pointing out
that improvement

12:42.805 --> 12:45.808
is measurable in
nearly every respect.

12:45.852 --> 12:47.636
- This is stupid.

12:47.679 --> 12:50.073
Casey won't say it,
I'll say it, all right?

12:50.117 --> 12:51.596
Otis is driving,
end of story.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.163
- Boom,
drop the mic.

12:53.207 --> 12:55.078
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Pick that mic back up,

12:55.122 --> 12:57.428
plug it back into the jack,
because that is far

12:57.472 --> 12:58.690
from the end of this story.

12:58.734 --> 13:01.519
- Stella, I love you
like a daughter,

13:01.563 --> 13:03.478
but if you want to drive...

13:03.521 --> 13:04.827
Find another house.

13:04.871 --> 13:07.612
- Or, Herrmann--
stay with me on this--

13:07.656 --> 13:11.007
you can kiss my pretty little--
- Hold on--hold on!

13:11.051 --> 13:14.184
Before anyone
says anything regrettable.

13:14.228 --> 13:15.229
- Casey told us
we're going to have

13:15.272 --> 13:17.274
a competition for it.

13:17.318 --> 13:19.276
Let's have a competition.

13:19.320 --> 13:23.411
Defeated a bullet.
I can take on any comers.

13:25.630 --> 13:29.243
I mean, it's not like
it's a mud-100 or anything.

13:32.376 --> 13:35.292
- Hey, I talked to Charlie
over at Lion's Total Care.

13:35.336 --> 13:37.381
He's coming Tuesday
to pick up my turnout gear

13:37.425 --> 13:38.818
if you want in on that.

13:38.861 --> 13:42.256
- Yeah, I'll, uh,
throw mine in the cage.

13:42.299 --> 13:44.736
- All right.

13:47.261 --> 13:48.958
- I...

13:49.002 --> 13:52.179
I understand this station
saved my daughter this morning.

13:52.222 --> 13:56.052
- The cement truck...
How is she?

13:56.096 --> 14:00.013
- Doing good, doing good.
She has a leg fracture, but...

14:00.056 --> 14:02.493
I understand had you guys
shown up even a minute later

14:02.537 --> 14:04.887
it would have been...

14:04.931 --> 14:06.410
More than that.

14:06.454 --> 14:09.631
- Yeah, no, we're...
Glad she's okay.

14:09.674 --> 14:13.026
- It's always good to know
when we make a difference.

14:13.069 --> 14:14.679
- My mother told me

14:14.723 --> 14:16.681
when a stranger does
a kindness for you,

14:16.725 --> 14:19.162
you look them in the eye
and say thank you.

14:19.206 --> 14:22.818
So...
So thank you.

14:24.385 --> 14:26.387
- Sure.

14:26.430 --> 14:28.215
- I'm glad to do it.

14:28.258 --> 14:30.478
Will you...

14:30.521 --> 14:33.002
Give our best
to your daughter for us?

14:33.046 --> 14:34.699
- Will do, um...

14:34.743 --> 14:35.918
- Wallace.

14:35.962 --> 14:40.618
- Will do, Wallace.
Thank you again.

14:59.376 --> 15:01.901
- Boom shak-a-laka,
she replied!

15:03.554 --> 15:05.165
- She wants
to get together tomorrow.

15:05.208 --> 15:07.819
Dinner downtown.

15:07.863 --> 15:10.039
I look forward to it.

15:10.083 --> 15:13.564
- Bad idea.
Can't relive your past.

15:13.608 --> 15:16.480
- Thanks to Facebook,
you can.

15:20.615 --> 15:24.836
Ambulance 61, personal injury.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.026
- I had him up
in the chair

15:40.069 --> 15:41.157
and my foot hit the lever

15:41.201 --> 15:42.767
and...

15:42.811 --> 15:45.509
- The chair slipped!
Come on!

15:47.250 --> 15:51.994
- No! Agh!

15:52.038 --> 15:54.562
Oh!

15:54.605 --> 15:57.434
And he cut off my damn ear!

15:57.478 --> 15:59.001
- Let me see.

15:59.045 --> 16:02.265
- Ah, Ah!

16:12.623 --> 16:14.625
- Yes, ma'am.

16:16.062 --> 16:17.846
- In the back.
- Okay, grab a plastic bag,

16:17.889 --> 16:19.413
fill it up with ice,
and bring it to me.

16:19.456 --> 16:20.631
- Okay.

16:20.675 --> 16:22.503
- You telling me
you can take

16:22.546 --> 16:24.766
that man's ear
and fix it back on his head.

16:24.809 --> 16:29.031
- We are going to give
it a fighting chance.

16:57.538 --> 17:00.236
- Okay.

17:01.759 --> 17:03.065
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I can walk.

17:03.109 --> 17:05.894
He hasn't cut my legs off,
at least not yet!

17:14.076 --> 17:16.600
- Yep.

17:16.644 --> 17:18.646
Who's next?

17:20.865 --> 17:24.782
- Kelly,
got a favor to ask.

17:24.826 --> 17:26.480
What you got going on
this morning?

17:26.523 --> 17:28.134
- No plans.
- Do you mind running

17:28.177 --> 17:29.570
an errand with me?

17:29.613 --> 17:31.963
Need your expertise.
- Whatever you need.

17:32.007 --> 17:34.183
- I was talking to Scott
from four doors down.

17:34.227 --> 17:36.794
You know him?
Australian guy, Korean wife.

17:36.838 --> 17:38.448
- Oh yeah, I like them.

17:38.492 --> 17:40.537
- He said to me,
"You wanna come over

17:40.581 --> 17:42.496
"on Saturday
and watch the rugby?

17:42.539 --> 17:44.628
We're playing
the All Blacks."

17:44.672 --> 17:46.282
I said sounded good
but I'd check with you.

17:46.326 --> 17:47.631
- Is that your Australian
accent?

17:47.675 --> 17:49.633
- Yeah,
not bad right?

17:49.677 --> 17:51.287
Don't do it again.

17:51.331 --> 17:52.636
- Anyway, might be fun.

17:52.680 --> 17:54.029
I think it's going to be
a block party.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.683
- No, baby, we can't.
We've got that Bria thing.

17:55.726 --> 17:56.684
Remember I told you?

17:59.643 --> 18:02.472
Right, Saturday.
I absolutely

18:02.516 --> 18:03.865
was paying attention
when you said that.

18:03.908 --> 18:05.649
- Actually can we swing by
Bria's apartment now?

18:05.693 --> 18:07.564
I think she's spinning out.
I got to calm her down.

18:07.608 --> 18:09.784
- Yeah, sure.
- Good.

18:18.053 --> 18:20.882
- In her room.

18:27.193 --> 18:29.499
- I look like that girl from
the Adam's family.

18:29.543 --> 18:30.761
- No, you don't.

18:30.805 --> 18:31.762
You look beautiful
under there.

18:31.806 --> 18:34.069
- Prom's in four days.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.854
- I know.
Your Dad told me.

18:36.898 --> 18:41.250
Hey,
it's going to be fine.

18:41.294 --> 18:42.817
I live for this stuff.

18:42.860 --> 18:46.560
'Cause I look gross.

18:46.603 --> 18:49.171
- Have I ever
steered you wrong?

18:53.567 --> 18:58.615
Come on.

18:58.659 --> 19:01.966
First, we're going
to wipe that off

19:02.010 --> 19:03.533
and look
at the Bria underneath.

19:03.577 --> 19:05.970
Because that Bria
is going to turn heads

19:06.014 --> 19:09.191
when she enters the dance.
I promise you that.

19:19.114 --> 19:23.684
- All my friends at school,
they have moms to help.

19:23.727 --> 19:25.816
With me, it's just Dad.

19:25.860 --> 19:28.863
He's even worse
at this stuff than I...

19:32.432 --> 19:35.261
- Well, now you have me.

19:45.880 --> 19:46.228
.

19:46.272 --> 19:48.230
- You know I thought about
all the ways

19:48.274 --> 19:49.492
that I could provide for

19:49.536 --> 19:51.451
my daughter while
I was in the clinic.

19:51.494 --> 19:53.931
I never thought
about how to get ready

19:53.975 --> 19:55.672
for the prom.

19:55.716 --> 19:58.022
- Well, you called
a superwoman.

19:58.066 --> 19:59.894
So when I tell you
she's got this,

19:59.937 --> 20:02.331
she's got this.

20:03.289 --> 20:06.117
So, how's the rest
of it going?

20:06.161 --> 20:08.511
Since, you know...

20:08.555 --> 20:11.514
It's better.

20:11.558 --> 20:14.822
It's much, much better.
I got my job back.

20:14.865 --> 20:19.130
Turns out this guy, Sam,
that I'm on the line with,

20:19.174 --> 20:21.568
he got moved up to supervisor
and he said

20:21.611 --> 20:25.528
the past is the past
and he put me right to work.

20:25.572 --> 20:29.445
Now I'm just saving up to get
out of this dump.

20:29.489 --> 20:31.752
- That's really good news.

20:31.795 --> 20:33.406
- Yeah.

20:39.194 --> 20:41.892
- His name is
Donovan Mitchell.

20:41.936 --> 20:43.677
He's awesome.

20:43.720 --> 20:48.334
- Well, if he asked you,
I know he is.

20:48.377 --> 20:51.380
- He's like me.
We don't have a lot.

20:51.424 --> 20:54.688
I mean, we're not taking a limo
or doing a fancy dinner

20:54.731 --> 20:56.342
or anything.

20:56.385 --> 20:59.519
I just want to look nice
when we get there.

21:00.737 --> 21:03.262
- You're going to look
like a knock-out.

21:05.307 --> 21:06.569
Okay,
let's try out some looks.

21:06.613 --> 21:08.484
You can tell me what's best.
- Okay.

21:08.528 --> 21:13.097
- Uh-huh, yeah, I know,
they're both here.

21:13.141 --> 21:15.186
Yeah...

21:15.230 --> 21:18.451
Okay, will do.

21:19.408 --> 21:23.020
So, hey, that was Casey
and he says

21:23.064 --> 21:26.110
that spring training
starts now.

21:26.154 --> 21:27.416
- Explain.
- Mm-hmm.

21:27.460 --> 21:29.157
- Well, he says
since Mouch and I

21:29.200 --> 21:31.681
are the main ones to benefit,
or suffer,

21:31.725 --> 21:35.250
depending on which way this
driver choice thing pans out,

21:35.294 --> 21:37.121
that we should, you know,
have a big part

21:37.165 --> 21:38.340
in the evaluation.

21:38.384 --> 21:40.299
- That's leadership
right there.

21:40.342 --> 21:43.258
- That sounds like BS. Mm-hmm.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.956
Do you want to call him?
Call him. Be my guest.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.524
- Tell us the competition
you have in mind, Herrmann.

21:48.568 --> 21:50.787
- There's two cabinets there
full of glasses

21:50.831 --> 21:52.267
that need polishing.

21:52.311 --> 21:55.923
There's two more down there.
First one done...

21:55.966 --> 21:57.316
Wins my endorsement.

21:57.359 --> 22:00.797
- Now I know
you're full of it.

22:08.501 --> 22:09.937
- What--

22:09.980 --> 22:11.242
Well, you didn't say go!

22:11.678 --> 22:13.897
- Did you really talk
to Casey?

22:24.212 --> 22:26.519
- Been thinking about it
a long time.

22:26.562 --> 22:28.651
Figured I'd reward myself
if I ever made

22:28.695 --> 22:31.175
deputy district chief,
but...

22:31.219 --> 22:33.656
That's not happening.

22:33.700 --> 22:35.179
- No.

22:35.223 --> 22:37.181
Found out yesterday morning.

22:37.225 --> 22:39.009
- Well, don't overreact.

22:39.053 --> 22:41.055
- I'm not.

22:41.098 --> 22:42.535
Just got to thinking.

22:42.578 --> 22:46.669
I spent a lot of time
waiting for good things

22:46.713 --> 22:50.586
and not enough time
pursuing 'em.

22:50.630 --> 22:53.372
Mom and Daddy brought me up
humble and proud.

22:53.415 --> 22:56.853
So...awards,
commendations, promotions,

22:56.897 --> 22:58.855
they weren't things
that you seek out.

22:58.899 --> 23:01.162
I mean if they came along
that's fine, but...

23:01.205 --> 23:03.730
they weren't pursued.

23:05.035 --> 23:06.515
It turns out...

23:06.559 --> 23:09.170
I kind of wanted
that promotion.

23:09.213 --> 23:11.128
- Yeah.

23:11.172 --> 23:13.435
- Anyway,
the reason we are here

23:13.479 --> 23:15.698
is I am not going
another summer without a boat.

23:15.742 --> 23:17.439
- Somewhere where I can

23:17.483 --> 23:19.876
tool around the lake, go
fishing with you and Casey,

23:19.920 --> 23:23.227
or...
Teach Terrance how to catch

23:23.271 --> 23:24.577
a large mouthed bass.

23:24.620 --> 23:25.795
- Okay, chief,
but as a guy

23:25.839 --> 23:28.232
that repairs these,
let me warn you.

23:28.276 --> 23:29.930
Two things
I managed to never buy--

23:29.973 --> 23:32.715
a horse
or a boat.

23:49.210 --> 23:52.169
- Josef Ignacio Cruz.

23:58.219 --> 24:03.442
Look at you.
Looking as fine as 1999.

24:03.485 --> 24:06.096
- You have not changed...

24:06.140 --> 24:08.621
A bit, Delia.

24:08.664 --> 24:11.362
- Except I'm 36 and no longer
sprinting 100 meters,

24:11.406 --> 24:13.060
but, you know.

24:13.103 --> 24:15.671
- I bet you still could.

24:21.634 --> 24:24.637
- Oh, it's so good to see you.

24:25.899 --> 24:28.815
- Yeah, you too.

24:28.858 --> 24:30.294
I couldn't believe it
when you showed up

24:30.338 --> 24:31.426
in my inbox.

24:31.470 --> 24:34.473
- I'm just glad you answered.

24:37.345 --> 24:38.825
- So...

24:38.868 --> 24:42.959
I noticed on your relationship
status on Facebook

24:43.003 --> 24:45.571
that you're--
- I say this right off the bat

24:45.614 --> 24:48.487
so you know I'm not
playing with you, Jo.

24:48.530 --> 24:51.577
I am married.

24:51.620 --> 24:54.884
- Yeah.
That's--that's what I noticed.

24:56.146 --> 24:58.322
- But...
the truth is...

24:58.366 --> 25:00.977
I've thought about you.

25:01.021 --> 25:05.373
And that time we spent together
before I left to KU...

25:05.416 --> 25:09.682
Over and over again.

25:09.725 --> 25:12.511
I can't get it
out of my head.

25:12.554 --> 25:14.817
- I get it.

25:14.861 --> 25:16.384
- But I don't
want to just think

25:16.427 --> 25:18.212
about our time together
anymore,

25:18.255 --> 25:19.561
you know?

25:19.605 --> 25:21.911
Life's too short.

25:30.093 --> 25:32.922
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

25:33.923 --> 25:35.708
- Hey, Hermann.

25:35.751 --> 25:37.579
You used to run
that limo business, right?

25:37.623 --> 25:39.363
Do you still
have any connections?

25:39.407 --> 25:41.540
No, I got out

25:41.583 --> 25:43.803
while the getting was bad.
Why?

25:43.846 --> 25:45.892
- Oh, Bria and her boyfriend
are trying to go to prom

25:45.935 --> 25:48.198
I was seeing if I could
get them a discounted ride.

25:48.242 --> 25:49.678
- I walked to my prom.

25:49.722 --> 25:52.768
Told Sharlene
to meet me there.

25:52.812 --> 25:55.554
Come to think of it,
that didn't go over so well.

25:55.597 --> 25:58.078
- Hey, listen,
you tell Bria

25:58.121 --> 25:59.906
that every single limo
in the world

25:59.949 --> 26:02.038
has been puked
in multiple times.

26:02.082 --> 26:04.563
And they even have a guy
at the limo company

26:04.606 --> 26:06.608
whose job it is
is to clean up the puke

26:06.652 --> 26:08.915
every weekend.

26:08.958 --> 26:10.960
- You know what,
you both have been

26:11.004 --> 26:12.788
a tremendous help.

26:12.832 --> 26:15.661
I'm just going to...
Oh, Jesus.

26:22.624 --> 26:24.191
- Outside messenger service
dropped it off.

26:24.234 --> 26:26.062
That's all it had on it.

26:26.106 --> 26:28.108
- Thanks, Connie.

26:37.900 --> 26:39.423
Connie!

26:39.467 --> 26:43.079
Get me the CFD legal
department ASAP.

26:44.472 --> 26:46.605
- Chief.

26:46.648 --> 26:48.171
What the hell is this?

26:48.215 --> 26:49.608
- I don't know.

26:49.651 --> 26:50.739
- But we are going
to do everything

26:50.783 --> 26:52.436
exactly by the book.
Connie!

26:52.480 --> 26:54.743
You are witness for both of us
that we refuse this money

26:54.787 --> 26:56.440
and we are calling it in
to headquarters.

26:56.484 --> 26:58.617
- Yes, chief!

27:01.663 --> 27:03.622
There's no letter,
there's no signature.

27:03.665 --> 27:05.449
I have no idea
what is going on here

27:05.493 --> 27:07.016
but I am not
taking any chances.

27:07.060 --> 27:11.499
- Attorney for the CFD
on line one, chief.

27:11.542 --> 27:15.024
- Chief Wallace Boden,
Firehouse 51.

27:15.068 --> 27:17.113
Yes, thank you.

27:17.157 --> 27:19.725
I have something...

27:19.768 --> 27:22.728
That I want to make sure
I handle appropriately.

27:31.214 --> 27:31.432
.

27:31.475 --> 27:34.087
- If we don't hear again
from the CFD lawyer,

27:34.130 --> 27:35.479
I'm going straight
from here to headquarters.

27:35.523 --> 27:37.220
I'm dropping this box
off at her desk

27:37.264 --> 27:39.048
at the end of shift
and then she can deal with it.

27:39.092 --> 27:41.137
- That's good by me.

27:41.181 --> 27:43.487
- Chief.

27:43.531 --> 27:46.577
- It's actually
the commissioner's office.

27:51.060 --> 27:53.933
- Chief Wallace Boden.

27:53.976 --> 27:57.240
Yes, ma'am,
I understand.

27:57.284 --> 28:00.069
Yeah, I'm looking
at him right now.

28:02.985 --> 28:05.422
We'll be right over.

28:05.466 --> 28:08.425
We've been summoned.

28:22.788 --> 28:25.399
- She decelerated
a bit there.

28:25.442 --> 28:29.620
Uneven torque
on the reverse turn.

28:29.664 --> 28:31.753
It affects
overall fuel efficiency.

28:31.797 --> 28:35.017
It does.

28:43.330 --> 28:45.506
Well, pretty hard to improve

28:45.549 --> 28:48.204
on perfection,
but good luck.

28:49.249 --> 28:51.338
- I want a turn out
on the blue island

28:51.381 --> 28:54.515
up to the South Apron
and back through the cones.

28:57.561 --> 29:01.957
- Hey, don't even think about
that turtle enclosure

29:02.001 --> 29:04.655
that you backed right into
and crushed.

29:04.699 --> 29:07.180
You got this, Otis.

29:08.137 --> 29:10.749
- Any time.

29:21.194 --> 29:25.067
- Lights and siren...
Lights and siren.

29:27.069 --> 29:29.202
- Ooh!

29:37.819 --> 29:39.690
- Hey,
you got a second?

29:39.734 --> 29:41.344
- Course.

29:41.388 --> 29:44.217
- Okay, so you know how
everybody's got

29:44.260 --> 29:46.785
two angels on each shoulder,
one good, one bad?

29:46.828 --> 29:48.874
- Well, actually
it's an angel and a devil,

29:48.917 --> 29:51.180
but...
- Right--okay--so

29:51.224 --> 29:53.835
you're the angel
and Otis is the devil,

29:53.879 --> 29:55.619
which is why I'm
coming to you.

29:55.663 --> 29:57.752
I need some good advice.

29:58.884 --> 30:02.844
- 'Kay.
Lay it on me.

30:02.888 --> 30:06.543
- Ha, uh, okay...
So...

30:06.587 --> 30:08.894
There's this girl
I went to high school with.

30:08.937 --> 30:11.287
- I'm well aware.

30:12.201 --> 30:14.421
Go ahead.

30:14.464 --> 30:18.425
- So, she's married.
But--but!

30:18.468 --> 30:20.775
It's one of those things
where they're already talking

30:20.819 --> 30:23.212
about divorce
and there are no kids involved

30:23.256 --> 30:24.735
and the whole thing
is pretty much

30:24.779 --> 30:26.041
on its last legs.

30:26.085 --> 30:28.130
- Okay...
- So we met up

30:28.174 --> 30:30.132
for a meal.

30:30.176 --> 30:32.613
And at the end...

30:34.484 --> 30:37.836
I got the check
and that was that.

30:38.619 --> 30:41.056
- Well, that's not where
I thought this was going.

30:41.100 --> 30:42.884
Good, good for you, Jo.

30:42.928 --> 30:45.408
- Right, except...

30:45.452 --> 30:47.715
She said she's getting
a hotel room

30:47.758 --> 30:50.849
at the Sofitel
and that we should meet there.

30:50.892 --> 30:53.286
Relive the old days.

30:55.636 --> 30:58.552
What do I do?

30:58.595 --> 31:00.249
You cannot go through
with this.

31:00.293 --> 31:01.990
You're too good a guy.
You have too good a heart.

31:02.034 --> 31:04.340
You are literally
one of the all-time catches

31:04.384 --> 31:05.907
walking around Chicago,
and this woman,

31:05.951 --> 31:09.215
whatever she's playing at,
she does not deserve you.

31:14.046 --> 31:15.917
- Umm...

31:15.961 --> 31:19.355
That was a strong opinion.

31:20.269 --> 31:23.794
- Yeah--it-yeah.
It is. It was.

31:24.665 --> 31:27.276
- Okay...

31:27.320 --> 31:30.192
That means a lot to me.

31:30.236 --> 31:34.457
I will take what you said
and I will...

31:34.501 --> 31:37.199
I will think about it.

31:38.157 --> 31:40.333
- Hmm.

31:58.003 --> 31:59.482
- Wallace.
Kelly.

31:59.526 --> 32:01.397
- Chief Grissom.
What are you doing here?

32:01.441 --> 32:03.312
- You tell me.
I got called down

32:03.356 --> 32:05.793
by the commissioner.
Something involving 51.

32:05.836 --> 32:08.013
- Severide and I
received unmarked envelopes

32:08.056 --> 32:09.710
full of cash, 30,000 each.

32:09.753 --> 32:12.321
Why am I just hearing
about this now?

32:12.365 --> 32:13.496
- We went straight
to legal with it.

32:13.540 --> 32:14.715
Didn't intend
to blindside you.

32:14.758 --> 32:16.586
- But you did.

32:16.630 --> 32:18.371
Whatever you're into, Wallace,
you keep me out of it,

32:18.414 --> 32:20.329
you understand?
I can't have any trouble.

32:20.373 --> 32:22.418
Not right now.

32:22.462 --> 32:24.725
- The commissioner
will see you now.

- I believe we've had a bit
of a misunderstanding.

32:46.442 --> 32:48.357
- Mea culpa.
- Tell 'em, Joe.

32:48.401 --> 32:51.099
And say it loud in case
the FBI is bugging my office.

32:51.143 --> 32:53.493

a bad thing.

I...
I wanted to show

32:55.495 --> 32:57.584
my appreciation for
what you did for my daughter,

32:57.627 --> 33:00.021
pulling her out of the
concrete, saving her and all.

33:00.065 --> 33:02.023
Where I was raised,
Brooklyn, New York,

33:02.067 --> 33:04.808
you owe a man your life,
you slide a little money

33:04.852 --> 33:06.375
into an envelope,
you press his palm.

33:06.419 --> 33:08.812
You say "How do you do?"
That type of thing.

33:08.856 --> 33:10.205
Apparently that's frowned upon
these days.

33:10.249 --> 33:12.033
- Yeah, a little more
than frowned upon.

33:12.077 --> 33:14.949
- Like I said, my bad,
No one's got to know.

33:14.993 --> 33:18.170

that we are not talking about,

33:18.213 --> 33:21.695

lock and key, Mr. Pittman.

33:21.738 --> 33:23.914
You can come get it
as soon as possible.

33:23.958 --> 33:25.568
- If you want to make
a donation

33:25.612 --> 33:27.353
to the 100 Club of Chicago,
no one's going to stop you.

33:27.396 --> 33:29.137
- Hey, that's a thought,
I could put it in your names.

33:29.181 --> 33:32.010
- Or you could
send it anonymously.

33:32.053 --> 33:34.316
Save us any more attention.

33:34.360 --> 33:35.752
- Understood.

33:35.796 --> 33:37.145
You need anything else
from me, Bill?

33:37.189 --> 33:39.452
- That's it.
Thanks for clearing this up.

33:39.495 --> 33:42.368
Thanks, boys.
Dismissed.

33:47.721 --> 33:49.331
- Looks like
we dodged a bullet there.

33:49.375 --> 33:50.550
- Sure did.

33:50.593 --> 33:53.031
- Sorry I got
a little prickly before.

33:54.641 --> 33:56.860
- "A little prickly."

33:56.904 --> 33:59.689
Is it just me
or is he up to something?

33:59.733 --> 34:02.127
- Gris is always
up to something.

34:14.182 --> 34:16.489
Okay.

34:16.532 --> 34:18.099
I've made my decision.

After much consideration
and taking into account

34:21.407 --> 34:23.191

- Before you reveal

34:23.235 --> 34:25.802
your choice, captain,
would you mind

34:25.846 --> 34:28.457
if I had a word with Otis
real quick?

34:32.418 --> 34:34.072
- Sure.

34:35.725 --> 34:38.424
- Come on.

34:43.733 --> 34:45.866
What's it worth to you?

34:45.909 --> 34:47.041
Driving?

34:47.085 --> 34:48.086
- For me to back out.

34:48.129 --> 34:49.435
- Look.

34:49.478 --> 34:51.176
He is going to pick my name.

34:51.219 --> 34:55.223
So this is my moment
for maximum leverage.

34:55.267 --> 34:56.920
- Have you been dating
a stockbroker

34:56.964 --> 34:58.574
when I wasn't looking?
- I'm asking...

34:58.618 --> 34:59.967
What's it worth to you?

35:00.010 --> 35:01.925
All my Saturday pick-ups
at Molly's?

35:01.969 --> 35:05.103
Yeah, definitely.

35:05.146 --> 35:07.801
- Rolling the hoses
twice a month?

35:07.844 --> 35:09.194
- Okay.

35:09.237 --> 35:11.109
- And all my bathroom duties
for a year.

35:11.152 --> 35:12.806
- Too far.
- Okay--okay.

35:12.849 --> 35:15.852
Okay.

35:15.896 --> 35:20.509
First two
and then I bow out.

35:21.728 --> 35:24.078
- Deal.

35:25.297 --> 35:27.212
- Deal.

35:30.867 --> 35:34.001
Captain.

35:34.044 --> 35:38.353
We have reached
a decision ourselves.

35:38.397 --> 35:40.703
I'm withdrawing my name
from consideration.

35:45.012 --> 35:47.580
- Fine by me.
Otis...

35:47.623 --> 35:49.495
Back on as the driver.

35:51.845 --> 35:53.499
- That's our boy!

35:58.678 --> 36:01.071
- Captain!

36:01.115 --> 36:05.075
Hey, I--
I just wanted to say that

36:05.119 --> 36:07.121
I don't know whose name
you were going to pick--

36:07.165 --> 36:10.211
- This was just a scheme to get
Otis to do all your chores?

36:11.473 --> 36:13.823
- Well...

36:13.867 --> 36:15.651
- Well played.

36:16.348 --> 36:19.786
- Well, actually, I--
I just knew the sooner

36:19.829 --> 36:21.353
that I could get
everyone back to treating

36:21.396 --> 36:23.398
Otis the way
that we always did, the better.

36:23.442 --> 36:26.314
I figured,
mixing it up with him

36:26.358 --> 36:28.011
was the best way to get
Herrmann and Mouch

36:28.055 --> 36:30.536
back to normal.
- Huh.

36:30.579 --> 36:33.887
Double well-played, then.

36:33.930 --> 36:36.411
You know what?

36:36.455 --> 36:38.108
Would you like
to drive the truck

36:38.152 --> 36:41.677
one last time before
you hand over the keys?

36:41.721 --> 36:44.071

To get him this box?

36:56.126 --> 36:57.780
He must have misplaced it.

36:57.824 --> 37:00.218
- Got it.

37:02.655 --> 37:05.048
- It's too bad, Chief.
Could have made

37:05.092 --> 37:08.574
a nice down payment
on that boat you wanted.

37:08.617 --> 37:11.011
- I already bought it.

37:11.054 --> 37:12.273
- No.
- Yeah.

37:12.317 --> 37:14.232
- No!
- Oh, yeah!

37:14.275 --> 37:15.972
- Yep!

37:16.016 --> 37:17.931
I spent too much time
back pedaling

37:17.974 --> 37:21.195
from the future,
instead...

37:21.239 --> 37:23.502
