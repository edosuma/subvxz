00:13.138 --> 00:15.182
My nanny, Ole Golly,

00:15.265 --> 00:18.685
says that to be a great writer,
you have to know everything.

00:21.021 --> 00:25.484
And to know everything,
you have to see everything.

00:26.151 --> 00:29.655
And to see everything,
you need to be a spy.

00:30.489 --> 00:32.991
And to be a spy, you need your spy stuff.

00:38.080 --> 00:39.248
Harriet!

00:39.748 --> 00:40.874
Coming!

00:40.958 --> 00:45.003
I wasn't supposed to go spying
during a school day, but I didn't care.

00:45.087 --> 00:48.298
For something this big,
rules would have to be broken,

00:48.382 --> 00:52.469
dark secrets exposed,
purple butterfly yo-yos unleashed.

00:53.720 --> 00:57.140
Harriet M. Welsch,
what are you doing up there?

00:57.766 --> 00:58.767
Nothing.

00:59.935 --> 01:04.188
Nothing, except getting ready
to go on the most daring, dangerous,

01:04.272 --> 01:06.441
history-making mission of my life.

01:08.610 --> 01:11.280
I just wanna be
You just wanna be

01:11.363 --> 01:13.031
We just wanna be

01:14.157 --> 01:16.994
I am gonna be who I wanna be

01:17.077 --> 01:18.996
My autonomy

01:19.079 --> 01:22.040
No, I won't cut my hair

01:22.124 --> 01:24.501
And I'll wear whatever

01:24.585 --> 01:30.591
I like it when I get to be myself

01:30.674 --> 01:33.427
I don't wanna be
You don't wanna be

01:33.510 --> 01:36.388
We don't wanna be told what to do

01:43.187 --> 01:44.855
Hi, everybody. Sorry I'm late.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.065
A lot of extra stuff to pack
for school today.

01:47.733 --> 01:49.776
Something special going on?

01:51.486 --> 01:53.030
Just a big history paper.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.407
-Mom.
-Harriet,

01:55.490 --> 01:57.868
how can you see
with those bangs in your eyes?

01:57.951 --> 01:59.369
I like my bangs.

02:00.746 --> 02:02.497
They're good bangs.

02:02.581 --> 02:04.625
They're great bangs.

02:06.251 --> 02:08.086
What are you writing your paper about?

02:08.169 --> 02:10.797
Something nobody's
ever written about before.

02:11.882 --> 02:13.759
That's what a good writer does.

02:13.842 --> 02:16.637
That's Ole Golly.
She's my nanny and my guru.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.138
I'd be lost without her.

02:18.722 --> 02:21.517
So what's for lunch today, Ole Golly?

02:22.059 --> 02:23.185
I don't know.

02:23.268 --> 02:27.397
How about a nice tomato sandwich
with mayonnaise on white bread?

02:27.481 --> 02:28.482
Let me think.

02:28.565 --> 02:33.070
Am I in a "tomato sandwich with mayonnaise
on white bread" kinda mood today?

02:48.752 --> 02:49.753
Truth is,

02:49.837 --> 02:53.215
I've been in a "tomato sandwich with
mayonnaise on white bread" kinda mood

02:53.298 --> 02:55.384
for about five and a half years straight.

02:58.428 --> 03:01.390
That's 2,008 tomato sandwiches,

03:01.473 --> 03:05.143
which equals about 2,008 times
my mother has said this:

03:05.227 --> 03:07.646
Harriet, if you eat
another tomato sandwich,

03:07.729 --> 03:10.023
you're going to turn into
a tomato sandwich.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.025
I wish.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.027
Gotta go. Wish me luck.

03:14.528 --> 03:15.612
Good luck, honey.

03:15.696 --> 03:16.905
Good luck.

03:21.660 --> 03:23.203
It's not about luck, Harriet.

03:23.871 --> 03:27.708
Remember, life is a struggle,
and a good spy never quits.

03:28.625 --> 03:29.918
Gotta remember that.

03:36.216 --> 03:40.095
Be a good Harriet.
And watch where you're going!

03:51.064 --> 03:53.609
This is my best friend, Janie Gibbs.

03:53.692 --> 03:56.195
I've known her since kindergarten
and can tell you

03:56.278 --> 03:58.405
she's getting weirder every year.

03:59.489 --> 04:03.660
Sport, would you rather have a head the
size of a pumpkin or the size of a fist?

04:04.870 --> 04:07.664
Simon "Sport" Rocque is
my other best friend.

04:07.748 --> 04:10.250
In a funny way,
he's getting more normal every year.

04:11.293 --> 04:12.669
How big is the pumpkin?

04:14.463 --> 04:15.547
Pumpkin.

04:19.801 --> 04:23.222
I don't have time to tell you about
everybody else at the Gregory School.

04:23.305 --> 04:24.640
However,

04:25.307 --> 04:28.894
I will mention Marion Hawthorne
because she is a mean, rotten person

04:28.977 --> 04:31.647
who Janie and I will
someday get revenge on.

04:34.399 --> 04:36.360
Good morning, Mr. Horatio.

04:36.443 --> 04:37.903
Good morning, Marion.

04:38.529 --> 04:41.281
Pinky Whitehead, stop what you're doing.

04:42.824 --> 04:47.538
I'm warning you, Pinky.
Last chance. Don't do it.

04:51.416 --> 04:54.586
Can I have your attention, please?
Per the class syllabus,

04:54.670 --> 04:58.048
you've got two free periods to do
your off-site history research.

04:58.131 --> 05:02.094
If you're not back in time,
it will be noted in your-- Marion?

05:02.761 --> 05:04.972
In your permanent record.

05:07.516 --> 05:10.602
I'm glad I'm not perfect.
I'd be bored to death.

05:14.189 --> 05:15.732
Do you know where I'm going?

05:16.316 --> 05:18.110
To the library, like everybody?

05:18.193 --> 05:19.444
Not me.

05:19.528 --> 05:21.280
You're going spying?

05:21.363 --> 05:25.367
While you guys are researching
old stuff from days of yore,

05:25.450 --> 05:28.996
I'm going to see
some history that's happening today.

05:31.456 --> 05:35.377
Her name is Agatha K. Plumber.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.547
She's some kind of lawyer.

05:38.630 --> 05:41.049
I used to see her every morning
walking her dogs,

05:41.133 --> 05:44.761
who were always wearing
these wild outfits she made herself.

05:44.845 --> 05:47.723
Then one day,
she and her dogs disappeared.

05:48.432 --> 05:49.766
So about four months ago,

05:49.850 --> 05:53.145
I put Mrs. Plumber on my spy route
to see what happened to her.

06:02.196 --> 06:04.281
The good news is,
is she quit her boring job

06:04.364 --> 06:06.825
so she could open a doggy clothing store.

06:06.909 --> 06:08.869
The bad news is…

06:08.952 --> 06:12.039
Do you have any idea how much rent is
on the Upper East Side?

06:12.122 --> 06:14.082
…that it's going to cost a lot of money.

06:14.166 --> 06:16.627
I'll have to get a big loan from the bank.

06:21.089 --> 06:23.008
This could be a disaster.

06:24.801 --> 06:28.555
Turns out, Mrs. Plumber is
so scared about starting her new life

06:28.639 --> 06:30.557
that she never gets out of bed.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.269
Mrs. Plumber, are you okay?

06:34.353 --> 06:35.854
It's okay, Nadine.

06:36.688 --> 06:38.482
I'm just having a moment.

06:45.656 --> 06:47.533
Poor Mrs. Plumber.

06:47.616 --> 06:49.451
Well, if it doesn't work out,

06:49.535 --> 06:51.995
she could always be a bed lady
who lives in her bed.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.039
Janie, she's getting out of bed.

06:54.122 --> 06:58.627
Thanks to some expert spying, I know
she has a hair appointment this morning.

06:59.169 --> 07:02.047
That means she'll have to get out of bed.

07:02.714 --> 07:05.384
Then get her hair done,
then go to the bank,

07:06.218 --> 07:08.554
get a loan, start her fabulous new life.

07:08.637 --> 07:12.140
And I will be there to witness
history in the making.

07:13.517 --> 07:15.978
Yeah, you sure you don't wanna go
to the library?

07:16.562 --> 07:18.939
History isn't just in books, Sport.

07:19.022 --> 07:21.358
It's happening all the time,
all around us.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.151
You just gotta know where to look.

07:24.653 --> 07:27.447
I'll meet you at
that little park on 79th at 11:00.

07:27.531 --> 07:30.075
We can head back to class
and I'll tell you all about

07:30.158 --> 07:35.330
the historic day Mrs. Agatha K. Plumber
got off her butt and started her new life.

07:35.414 --> 07:37.124
She's gonna get an F.

07:37.207 --> 07:38.208
Definitely.

07:39.418 --> 07:40.794
I didn't have a lot of time.

07:40.878 --> 07:44.173
I had to get to the hair salon
to make sure Mrs. Plumber didn't cancel,

07:44.256 --> 07:46.925
then get to
Mrs. Plumber's apartment by 9:45

07:47.009 --> 07:51.054
to witness the exact moment
she got out of bed.

07:52.764 --> 07:56.476
But first, I had to change
into my spy clothes.

07:58.896 --> 08:01.648
It starts with these glasses
without lenses

08:01.732 --> 08:05.444
that I swiped from my father's desk,
which make me look smarter.

08:05.527 --> 08:10.741
On my spy belt, I carry a flashlight,
a waterproof pouch for my notebook,

08:10.824 --> 08:15.370
another waterproof pouch for extra pens,
a canteen for thirstiness…

08:18.457 --> 08:22.294
and a collapsible fork
which I've never used, but you never know.

08:22.377 --> 08:25.172
This is just a junky transistor radio
that I use

08:25.255 --> 08:27.591
to create a soundtrack for my day.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.927
I love this song.

08:30.010 --> 08:33.096
Some will learn to shout it
Some won't

08:33.179 --> 08:36.015
But sooner or later, baby
Here's a ditty

08:36.099 --> 08:40.520
Say you're gonna have to get
Right down to the real nitty-gritty

08:40.604 --> 08:44.358
Let's get right down
To the real nitty-gritty

08:44.441 --> 08:46.485
Now one, two

08:47.194 --> 08:48.195
Nitty-gritty now

08:48.278 --> 08:49.905
Yeah, boom

08:50.405 --> 08:51.949
-Hey, Harriet.
-Hey, Ed.

08:54.952 --> 08:57.496
-Hey, how you doing?
-Hey, Squeegee.

08:57.579 --> 09:01.375
Right down to the real nitty-gritty
Double beatin'

09:01.458 --> 09:03.126
Double beatin'

09:03.210 --> 09:06.171
Right down to the nitty-gritty

09:06.839 --> 09:08.507
Double beatin'

09:08.590 --> 09:10.175
One, two

09:18.475 --> 09:21.311
I didn't know
why a cop would be tailing me,

09:22.688 --> 09:25.482
but I didn't wanna take any chances.

09:40.789 --> 09:43.208
I made it to Saffron's right on schedule.

09:54.303 --> 09:57.264
Why do you hide your eyes, honey?
They're gorgeous.

09:57.848 --> 10:01.476
Just give me ten minutes.
Snip, snip, a whole new you.

10:02.144 --> 10:03.645
Think about it.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.773
Look, I just stopped by

10:06.857 --> 10:11.278
to see if dear old Aunt Agatha still has
her hair appointment this morning.

10:11.361 --> 10:13.614
Let me see. Agatha…

10:14.406 --> 10:15.991
Plumber, yes. 10:15.

10:16.533 --> 10:18.869
If you want,
I could fit you right in before--

10:23.123 --> 10:25.083
Next up, Mrs. Plumber's.

10:31.340 --> 10:33.550
Usually, the best way to get inside

10:33.634 --> 10:36.970
is in the afternoon when
the doormen have to change shifts.

10:39.640 --> 10:42.976
Today I'd have to go with plan B.

10:47.481 --> 10:50.108
Wow, you're really good!

10:50.192 --> 10:52.611
With this job,
I get a lot of time to practice.

10:53.278 --> 10:56.990
I'm pretty good myself.
Wanna see me walk the dog?

11:00.118 --> 11:02.621
Not bad. But watch this.

11:05.958 --> 11:09.086
I don't wanna brag,
little girl, but where I come from,

11:09.169 --> 11:12.506
this is what we call
walking the ding dang…

11:13.590 --> 11:14.591
dog!

11:22.391 --> 11:26.311
In case you're wondering,
this thing is called a dumbwaiter.

11:26.395 --> 11:28.146
It's an old-fashioned mini elevator

11:28.230 --> 11:30.941
that delivers food and drinks
to different floors.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.986
It's also really good for spying.

11:37.281 --> 11:39.157
Come on!

11:55.215 --> 11:59.428
There we go. Who looks like a movie star?

12:00.762 --> 12:02.931
You look like a movie star.

12:04.224 --> 12:07.019
Okay, okay. I have to go to the salon now.

12:07.102 --> 12:08.562
Yes, you do.

12:10.189 --> 12:14.568
After all, I've gotta look dazzling
for my big meeting at the bank, don't I?

12:14.651 --> 12:16.320
Yes, you do.

12:16.403 --> 12:17.487
You know me.

12:17.571 --> 12:20.532
When I get my hair done,
I can take on the world.

12:20.616 --> 12:22.367
Yes, you can.

12:36.173 --> 12:39.009
I never had a staring contest
with dogs before,

12:39.092 --> 12:42.346
but I thought if I could just
maintain eye contact, I'd be okay.

12:42.429 --> 12:46.934
The problem was, I had to see
her feet touch the floor and make history.

12:52.523 --> 12:57.361
Can't look away. Almost there. Come on.

12:58.612 --> 13:00.572
Really wanna look.

13:04.952 --> 13:06.995
Don't look, don't look.

13:09.081 --> 13:10.541
I have to!

13:17.589 --> 13:19.299
What in the name of--

13:23.220 --> 13:24.555
Hi.

13:26.890 --> 13:28.141
Who are you?

13:28.225 --> 13:29.226
What do you want?

13:29.726 --> 13:31.144
I can explain.

13:31.228 --> 13:32.688
Come here, you!

13:33.772 --> 13:36.358
I'm really, really sorry.

13:36.441 --> 13:38.026
Get her out of here!

13:38.652 --> 13:40.237
And don't come back!

13:41.321 --> 13:43.365
It's okay. It's okay, babies.

13:43.448 --> 13:47.286
You can stop barking now.
I'm not going anywhere. Don't worry.

13:47.369 --> 13:52.207
I have to cancel all of my appointments.
The dogs are too upset, and I'm too upset.

13:52.791 --> 13:54.668
What is wrong with this world?

14:00.007 --> 14:02.259
Spies should not get caught.

14:02.843 --> 14:06.305
That is the one essential thing
about spies.

14:06.388 --> 14:10.058
I'm a rotten spy, which means
I'll never know everything,

14:10.142 --> 14:14.229
which means I will never be a good writer,
or even a regular writer.

14:24.865 --> 14:27.075
-What happened?
-Did Mrs. Plumber get out of bed?

14:27.159 --> 14:33.790
No. I got caught by dogs wearing pants,
and then her housekeeper threw me out.

14:34.583 --> 14:40.297
I can't believe it. Mrs. Plumber's foot
was this close to the floor.

14:42.174 --> 14:43.383
I blew it.

14:43.467 --> 14:45.719
It's okay, Harriet. We still love you.

14:48.180 --> 14:49.431
Let's just go back.

14:55.395 --> 14:56.396
"Quits"?

14:58.106 --> 15:00.859
"Life is a struggle, and a good spy never…

15:02.569 --> 15:03.779
quits."

15:03.862 --> 15:06.740
Guys, we can't go back, not yet.

15:06.823 --> 15:11.328
I messed everything up,
but maybe we can fix it.

15:18.126 --> 15:22.047
Your job: Make a new hair appointment
for Mrs. Plumber. 11:30, okay?

15:22.130 --> 15:25.592
Ask for Saffron.
Tell her it's a hair emergency.

15:25.676 --> 15:26.677
Got it.

15:27.886 --> 15:32.724
Janie, don't let them cut your bangs!
That's all they wanna do in there.

15:35.978 --> 15:37.521
Where we going?

15:38.105 --> 15:40.107
The belly of the beast.

15:46.655 --> 15:48.782
I gotta get through that door.

15:48.866 --> 15:50.576
The doorman looks really angry.

15:50.659 --> 15:53.078
He probably got in trouble
for letting me sneak in.

15:53.161 --> 15:55.789
Plus, he's a doorman,
how much fun could that be?

15:57.207 --> 15:58.834
I wouldn't mind being a doorman.

15:59.668 --> 16:02.296
You get a uniform.
You know everybody's name.

16:02.379 --> 16:04.506
You're like the mayor of the street.

16:06.133 --> 16:09.511
Why don't you tell him that?
Butter him up, distract him.

16:09.595 --> 16:11.346
I just need a couple of seconds.

16:14.433 --> 16:17.519
Sport Rocque.
I'm a big fan. I really like your work.

16:17.603 --> 16:18.645
Thank you.

16:18.729 --> 16:22.357
-Not everyone around here feels that way.
-What people don't understand is

16:22.441 --> 16:25.777
that there's a lot more to being a doorman
than just opening doors.

16:25.861 --> 16:28.322
Finally, someone who gets it.

16:28.405 --> 16:29.406
Ma'am.

16:31.366 --> 16:33.493
Hey, can I wear your hat?
Just for a second?

16:38.749 --> 16:39.750
Looks good.

16:39.833 --> 16:40.918
It feels good.

16:47.591 --> 16:49.885
-Hey, what does this do?
-It's my cab whistle.

16:49.968 --> 16:52.179
When you need a cab, you just--

16:57.351 --> 17:01.063
I'm sorry, Mac. False alarm.
I was talking to this kid.

17:06.234 --> 17:08.569
He was telling me how
he wanted to be a doorman.

17:16.411 --> 17:18.579
I don't get that kind of offer every day.

17:18.664 --> 17:21.541
I even let him wear my hat,
which I'm not really allowed to do.

17:21.625 --> 17:23.877
But you know me, I'm a rules breaker.

17:23.961 --> 17:25.378
So that's the story, Mac.

17:25.462 --> 17:26.964
Again, I'm real sorry.

17:35.180 --> 17:36.181
Hey!

17:36.265 --> 17:40.060
What are you doing? Stop right there!
Don't you even think about it.

17:42.229 --> 17:43.230
Stop!

17:43.313 --> 17:45.023
Top of the morning, Miss Welsch.

17:47.693 --> 17:49.361
Give me that.

17:51.989 --> 17:53.282
Come here, you!

18:07.588 --> 18:08.797
Hello, Mrs. Plumber.

18:09.882 --> 18:11.008
And Nadine.

18:11.675 --> 18:14.845
Just wanted to check and see
if everything was okay,

18:14.928 --> 18:18.473
which it looks like it definitely is,
so I'll just be on--

18:19.725 --> 18:20.976
Get back here, you!

18:24.396 --> 18:25.981
Dogs, protect me!

18:27.191 --> 18:30.944
Mrs. Plumber,
my name is Harriet M. Welsch,

18:31.028 --> 18:34.239
and I'm sorry I keep scaring you
and making your dogs go bananas,

18:34.323 --> 18:36.909
but I have to try and fix
what I messed up,

18:36.992 --> 18:39.369
which is you making history.

18:39.870 --> 18:42.414
I know how scary it is
to try something new.

18:42.497 --> 18:45.918
But Ole Golly says life is a struggle,
and you can never quit,

18:46.001 --> 18:48.128
whether you're a writer, or a spy,

18:48.212 --> 18:50.964
or someone who has
a dream of making pants for dogs.

18:57.387 --> 19:01.892
Should dogs wear pants? I don't know!
I genuinely don't know.

19:01.975 --> 19:04.728
It seems a little weird,
but I'm not a dog.

19:04.811 --> 19:08.524
I'm just somebody who's sick
of seeing you flop around like a fish

19:08.607 --> 19:10.442
on this big dog bed!

19:11.401 --> 19:13.737
Here's the thing, and I'll keep it simple.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.572
If you don't get off your butt,

19:15.656 --> 19:18.367
get a hairdo that makes
you feel like ten million bucks,

19:18.450 --> 19:22.412
and then go to the bank and get your loan
and open your dog pants store,

19:22.496 --> 19:26.416
I swear I will barge into your room
like a maniac

19:26.500 --> 19:30.420
every single day
for the rest of your life.

19:33.841 --> 19:34.883
Please.

19:41.640 --> 19:43.225
I'm calling the police.

19:44.351 --> 19:46.687
No, Nadine, wait. She's right.

19:46.770 --> 19:49.314
I've been languishing in this bed
for far too long.

20:03.161 --> 20:04.454
That wasn't so hard.

20:07.207 --> 20:09.042
Thank you, Harriet M. Welsch.

20:11.253 --> 20:12.546
You better get going.

20:12.629 --> 20:15.382
What do you mean?
I canceled my hair appointment.

20:15.465 --> 20:17.259
Don't worry, it's been uncanceled.

20:17.342 --> 20:18.677
Wait, how?

20:18.760 --> 20:20.012
I've got my people on it.

20:20.095 --> 20:21.805
Not the bangs, not the bangs!

20:23.765 --> 20:25.267
I don't know.

20:25.350 --> 20:28.854
It might be easier for me to make it
for tomorrow or next week.

20:29.354 --> 20:30.939
I like this one for you.

20:32.107 --> 20:33.525
It didn't look good on me.

20:35.319 --> 20:36.945
The cosmopolitan?

20:37.029 --> 20:38.280
It's nice, right?

20:38.363 --> 20:39.865
Could you call us a cab, sir?

20:41.158 --> 20:43.035
Hey, down there. Catch.

20:43.869 --> 20:44.912
Yes!

20:48.415 --> 20:50.501
Sport and Janie got back just in time

20:50.584 --> 20:53.170
to save their permanent records
from destruction.

20:57.674 --> 21:01.094
They said they'd try and cover for me,
but I told them I'd be okay.

21:08.519 --> 21:13.023
When I got back to school,
I just told Mr. Horatio the truth.

21:18.529 --> 21:21.949
That if I was going to write
a paper about history in the making,

21:22.533 --> 21:26.245
I had to hang around
to make sure I got all the research.

21:28.121 --> 21:31.792
I mean, if you were writing a paper
about Washington crossing the Delaware,

21:31.875 --> 21:34.503
and you were actually on the boat,

21:34.586 --> 21:37.923
you'd wanna make sure old George
got to the other side, right?

21:38.590 --> 21:42.094
Mr. Horatio said, "Right,"
but in a way that made me think

21:42.177 --> 21:45.597
I'm probably going to be
staying after school for about ten years.

21:46.181 --> 21:47.349
Harriet.

21:50.352 --> 21:52.020
It's way past your bedtime.

21:52.646 --> 21:55.691
I wanna write everything down
so I don't forget it.

21:55.774 --> 21:58.110
Can I stay up just a little longer?

22:03.824 --> 22:05.075
I won't tell.

22:06.368 --> 22:10.038
Ole Golly, I don't just wanna be a writer,

22:10.122 --> 22:12.082
I wanna be a great writer.

22:12.165 --> 22:14.960
Well, that means
you've got to know everything.

22:15.043 --> 22:16.336
And to know everything…

22:16.420 --> 22:18.589
You've gotta see everything.

22:18.672 --> 22:20.549
And to see everything…

22:20.632 --> 22:23.302
You've got to be a spy.

22:38.400 --> 22:41.069
I just wanna be
You just wanna be

22:41.153 --> 22:42.821
We just wanna be

22:43.947 --> 22:46.491
I don't wanna be
You don't wanna be

22:46.575 --> 22:52.080
We don't wanna be told what to do

22:54.249 --> 22:59.922
And I try my best to do good
In the neighborhood

23:00.005 --> 23:02.466
I smile real nice

23:02.549 --> 23:05.761
And I strive to tell the truth

23:05.844 --> 23:08.347
I just wanna be
You just wanna be

23:08.430 --> 23:10.265
We just wanna be

23:11.141 --> 23:13.894
I don't wanna be
You don't wanna be

23:13.977 --> 23:16.730
We don't wanna be told what to do

23:16.813 --> 23:19.316
I am gonna be who I wanna be

23:19.399 --> 23:21.318
My autonomy

23:22.027 --> 23:24.821
I just wanna be
You just wanna be

23:24.905 --> 23:26.823
We just wanna be

23:26.907 --> 23:29.660
No, I won't cut my hair

23:29.743 --> 23:32.329
And I'll wear whatever

23:32.412 --> 23:38.001
I like it when I get to be myself

23:38.085 --> 23:40.921
I don't wanna be
You don't wanna be

23:41.004 --> 23:45.801
We don't wanna be told what to do
