00:01.694 --> 00:05.111
(dramatic excited music)

00:16.600 --> 00:19.183
(mystic music)

00:25.126 --> 00:27.224
(funky chill music)

00:27.224 --> 00:31.307
(man speaks in foreign language)

00:34.830 --> 00:37.440
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for joining us

00:37.440 --> 00:40.350
for another episode of "Edible Desires".

00:40.350 --> 00:42.210
Before we begin, please welcome

00:42.210 --> 00:45.563
my fabulous co-host, Nikki.

00:59.550 --> 01:00.810
- [Narrator] From the outside looking in

01:00.810 --> 01:04.150
it would seem like Nikki has
everything under control,

01:04.150 --> 01:08.090
that life is glamorous, full
of joy, excitement, luxury,

01:08.090 --> 01:09.193
all the things.

01:10.080 --> 01:11.620
And sure, while some of that is true,

01:11.620 --> 01:13.820
there's always more
than what meets the eye.

01:14.870 --> 01:17.300
We often only see the surface layer

01:17.300 --> 01:18.650
and that's for good reason.

01:19.590 --> 01:21.880
Most people don't wanna go deeper

01:21.880 --> 01:23.730
out of fear for what they might find.

01:25.080 --> 01:26.160
Whether it's in their minds

01:26.160 --> 01:28.030
or in their physical existence,

01:28.030 --> 01:30.033
humans tend to trap themselves.

01:31.090 --> 01:32.760
Not Nikki, though.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.653
She will find a way to be set free.

01:50.114 --> 01:53.114
(breathing heavily)

02:00.151 --> 02:03.068
(sultry R&B music)

02:16.579 --> 02:17.950
From the outside looking in,

02:17.950 --> 02:20.143
her life could even
seem like a fairy tale.

02:21.290 --> 02:23.313
But every fairy tale has a villain.

02:25.467 --> 02:26.389
(electronic dance music)

02:26.389 --> 02:29.784
♪ Derry derry poison, derry derry poison ♪

02:29.784 --> 02:32.506
♪ Till you get some snack, some snack ♪

02:32.506 --> 02:34.448
♪ Some crack, get back ♪

02:34.448 --> 02:35.946

02:35.946 --> 02:37.749

02:41.704 --> 02:46.371

02:48.505 --> 02:51.505
(breathing heavily)

02:57.349 --> 03:00.016
(woman moaning)

03:03.865 --> 03:07.948
(lightly tense electronic music)

03:30.770 --> 03:33.150
- [Narrator] Her boyfriend
Ethan was a genius,

03:33.150 --> 03:36.150
always working hard on the next big thing.

03:36.150 --> 03:38.970
This time it's something
involving binary sound waves.

03:38.970 --> 03:39.803
- Hey, babe.

03:39.803 --> 03:42.263
- [Narrator] Which keeps him
busy enough not to notice.

03:45.361 --> 03:46.194
- Mmm.

03:59.005 --> 04:01.505
(kooky music)

04:08.390 --> 04:09.890
- [Narrator] One ordinary day,

04:09.890 --> 04:11.593
while out walking her dogs,

04:12.940 --> 04:16.150
she noticed the most
handsomely attired man.

04:16.150 --> 04:17.913
He looked different.

04:19.520 --> 04:22.373
As if he was headed to a
grand event of some sort.

04:23.920 --> 04:27.180
He behaved a bit like a white
rabbit from a fairy tale,

04:27.180 --> 04:29.403
caught in a time warp
as he stared her way.

04:30.840 --> 04:33.180
Sometimes he visits her in her dreams.

04:35.592 --> 04:38.759
(light hip hop music)

04:54.720 --> 04:56.960
Rose has done a lot for Nikki.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.240
But she can't help but feel

04:58.240 --> 05:00.040
like there's more out there for her.

05:11.030 --> 05:12.160
- Who would have thought I would have

05:12.160 --> 05:13.410
to give up these so soon?

05:15.160 --> 05:16.453
I knew you'd be popular.

05:20.008 --> 05:22.330
You are quite different from the others.

05:24.190 --> 05:25.683
Oh, my sweet Nikki.

05:28.720 --> 05:29.553
- Rose.

05:31.350 --> 05:32.413
You protected me.

05:34.360 --> 05:36.448
When I was lost, you took me in.

05:36.448 --> 05:37.848
I'm never gonna forget that.

05:39.510 --> 05:41.563
- Your parents would be so proud.

05:42.461 --> 05:44.011
If only they could see you now.

05:58.430 --> 06:00.847
(calm music)

06:10.628 --> 06:12.010
(pulse throbbing)

06:12.010 --> 06:13.940
- [Narrator] She remembered
how one naughty man

06:13.940 --> 06:15.240
played very mean with her.

06:16.916 --> 06:19.416
(eerie music)

06:31.817 --> 06:34.660
(gasping)

06:34.660 --> 06:35.801
He gave her nasty medicine

06:35.801 --> 06:39.051
and left her behind like a broken doll.

06:41.641 --> 06:44.141
(tense music)

06:51.230 --> 06:52.893
Maurice still haunts her.

06:53.760 --> 06:56.643
She really believed that he
was a good man deep down.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.750
Will she ever heal from the trauma?

07:05.392 --> 07:08.809
(light electronic music)

07:15.570 --> 07:18.380
- Ladies, I've worked
very hard on this piece.

07:18.380 --> 07:19.680
You've all been paid well.

07:20.599 --> 07:21.749
I hope you're prepared.

07:23.439 --> 07:24.403
(bright music)

07:24.403 --> 07:26.403
The premiere's tomorrow.

07:32.204 --> 07:35.371
(lightly kooky music)

07:38.946 --> 07:42.543
(singing in foreign language)

07:42.543 --> 07:44.141
No, no, no, don't nod.

07:44.141 --> 07:45.323
I sing, you repeat.

07:45.323 --> 07:46.877
I sing, you respond.

07:46.877 --> 07:48.175
Respond.

07:48.175 --> 07:49.898
- No say.

07:49.898 --> 07:50.996
- Si.

07:50.996 --> 07:52.178
I sing, you repeat.

07:52.178 --> 07:54.862
I sing, you respond, respond.

07:54.862 --> 07:56.224
(speaks in foreign language)

07:56.224 --> 07:57.384
- No say.

07:57.384 --> 07:58.459
(speaks in foreign language)

07:58.459 --> 07:59.292
(speaks in foreign language)

07:59.292 --> 08:03.042
(speaks in foreign language)

08:09.000 --> 08:10.500
- [Women] To papa!

08:17.262 --> 08:19.845
(circus music)

08:35.903 --> 08:38.376
(crowd applauding)

08:38.376 --> 08:41.876
(upbeat electronic music)

08:47.105 --> 08:50.688
(song in foreign language)

09:39.433 --> 09:42.266
(plane whooshing)

10:17.630 --> 10:22.630
- Layabout, (mumbling)

10:23.798 --> 10:25.965
(wailing)

10:32.629 --> 10:36.462
(man screeching and laughing)

10:41.472 --> 10:43.722
(groaning)

10:44.789 --> 10:45.987
- Remember her, Sarah,

10:45.987 --> 10:49.404
this is the female form, a divine nimbus.

10:56.423 --> 10:57.357
- Oh!

10:57.357 --> 10:59.389
- I'm just gonna tickle you!

10:59.389 --> 11:01.639
(giggling)

11:03.919 --> 11:06.169
(laughing)

11:13.609 --> 11:15.859
(babbling)

11:27.940 --> 11:30.190
(babbling)

11:33.436 --> 11:35.603
(moaning)

11:51.748 --> 11:54.307
(birds chirping)

11:54.307 --> 11:57.724
(light electronic music)

12:10.966 --> 12:13.133
(sighing)

12:17.240 --> 12:18.440
- How's it coming along?

12:20.942 --> 12:21.780
- It's not good.

12:23.423 --> 12:25.560
I have my presentation
for the grant in two weeks

12:25.560 --> 12:27.243
and I'm shit creek fucked!

12:30.966 --> 12:33.247
Can you hear those damn dogs barking?

12:34.870 --> 12:36.417
It shouldn't be happening.

12:37.502 --> 12:39.653
Not at this frequency level anyway.

12:41.760 --> 12:43.010
- You're gonna figure it out, don't worry.

12:43.010 --> 12:44.503
You're too smart not to.

12:48.329 --> 12:49.398
- Wish I could take you with me

12:49.398 --> 12:54.069
to the review board. (sighing)

12:54.069 --> 12:55.819
Yeah, I can get this.

13:19.576 --> 13:20.839
(whimsical music)

13:20.839 --> 13:22.217
- Ethan!

13:22.217 --> 13:23.613
Honey, are these yours?

13:41.076 --> 13:43.826
(chimes ringing)

13:57.280 --> 13:58.581
(whooshing)

13:58.581 --> 14:03.581
(light music)
(birds chirping)

14:03.941 --> 14:06.191
(giggling)

14:08.193 --> 14:10.193
Wow, what is this place?

14:13.852 --> 14:16.519
(gavel banging)

14:17.609 --> 14:20.109
(kooky music)

14:23.434 --> 14:25.684
(laughing)

14:28.035 --> 14:29.774
- Nikki, wake up!

14:29.774 --> 14:30.857
Are you okay?

14:32.162 --> 14:34.227
Wake up, it's me.

14:34.227 --> 14:35.690
It's okay.

14:35.690 --> 14:38.273
Hey, come on, come on, breathe.

14:39.938 --> 14:40.771
Come on, it's okay.
- Getting tighter.

14:40.771 --> 14:41.654
- I got you.

14:41.654 --> 14:43.215
I got you.

14:43.215 --> 14:44.048
It's okay.

14:50.730 --> 14:52.480
It's okay, I got you.

14:57.498 --> 14:59.998
(tense music)

15:08.110 --> 15:09.840
- [Narrator] One is told
to stick to the devil

15:09.840 --> 15:10.883
they know best.

15:12.090 --> 15:14.453
But what if one knows multiple demons?

15:16.350 --> 15:17.183
What to do?

15:20.900 --> 15:25.060
- Tomorrow, let's go to our favorite spot

15:26.190 --> 15:27.253
for a nice picnic.

15:29.831 --> 15:30.833
You need some rest.

16:07.080 --> 16:08.583
- Why so disappointed?

16:09.884 --> 16:12.033
You know I can't give you them all.

16:15.250 --> 16:17.363
Overhead is high, I'm losing money.

16:18.910 --> 16:21.560
All the hotel rooms for you girls, rent.

16:21.560 --> 16:25.070
Credit cards, security, travel,

16:25.070 --> 16:27.860
dining, car leases, fucking cat food.

16:27.860 --> 16:30.660
The new girls especially don't
have their shit together.

16:33.337 --> 16:35.419
(phone ringing)

16:35.419 --> 16:36.252
He's calling again, isn't he?

16:37.604 --> 16:39.023
- Who, Maurice?

16:40.340 --> 16:41.550
Unfortunately.

16:41.550 --> 16:43.510
I've changed my number three times.

16:43.510 --> 16:44.803
He just does not quit.

16:46.450 --> 16:49.053
At least he stopped threatening
to barbecue my dogs.

16:51.330 --> 16:53.060
- You have that effect on people.

16:53.060 --> 16:55.350
- I make them wanna murder my pets?

16:55.350 --> 16:58.363
- No, but you're dangerously enchanting.

16:59.660 --> 17:01.210
I'm shocked that more of your clients

17:01.210 --> 17:02.623
don't take things too far.

17:04.840 --> 17:05.983
Does Ethan know?

17:07.070 --> 17:07.973
- Hell no.

17:09.730 --> 17:11.780
After what happened last time,

17:11.780 --> 17:13.073
Ethan would castrate him.

17:14.830 --> 17:17.200
- Maybe that would be for the best.

17:17.200 --> 17:19.650
You have to think of your own safety.

17:19.650 --> 17:21.140
- Maurice is harmless.

17:21.140 --> 17:23.990
Besides, Ethan is so stressed
out with work right now and

17:24.840 --> 17:26.490
the last time those two had an encounter,

17:26.490 --> 17:28.490
one was in the ER,

17:28.490 --> 17:30.770
Ethan was in handcuffs.

17:30.770 --> 17:32.820
I have enough drama in my life right now.

17:33.860 --> 17:36.083
- You know what's best, you always do.

17:38.010 --> 17:39.230
Just let me know if you'd like me

17:39.230 --> 17:42.880
to speak to Maurice, I
can be very persuasive.

17:42.880 --> 17:43.713
- I will.

17:50.070 --> 17:51.757
- Come on, boy.

17:51.757 --> 17:54.148
Come on, go on, go fetch it.

17:54.148 --> 17:55.231
Go on, go on.

17:56.960 --> 17:57.960
Oh, boo boo.

18:00.389 --> 18:02.889
(light music)

18:29.655 --> 18:30.695
- Hey.

18:30.695 --> 18:31.528
- Hi.

18:39.617 --> 18:42.217
- The last few months have
been beyond intense, huh?

18:46.327 --> 18:49.140
I don't know how you're not burnt out.

18:49.140 --> 18:52.330
I could barely drag my ass
out of bed this morning.

18:52.330 --> 18:53.163
- Trust me.

18:54.215 --> 18:55.415
I share your exhaustion.

18:58.010 --> 18:58.860
But I don't know.

18:59.960 --> 19:02.210
Ethan wants me to go
away with him somewhere.

19:03.690 --> 19:05.740
What's going away somewhere gonna do?

19:05.740 --> 19:07.533
It's not gonna change anything.

19:08.683 --> 19:09.833
- I just wanna be free.

19:11.070 --> 19:13.570
You know, I had this dream last night

19:13.570 --> 19:14.683
that I was flying.

19:16.060 --> 19:18.423
And I was hovering above the earth.

19:20.380 --> 19:23.360
And I saw my mom down there

19:23.360 --> 19:25.900
and she was waving and calling to me.

19:25.900 --> 19:28.570
I just wanted to sweep her up

19:28.570 --> 19:29.620
and take her with me.

19:31.272 --> 19:33.223
But then, for some reason,

19:34.187 --> 19:36.187
I just, I passed her by.

19:37.957 --> 19:41.560
And then when I looked back, she's gone.

19:43.990 --> 19:45.440
What do you think that means?

19:47.280 --> 19:49.360
- It means you should stop
fucking your therapist

19:49.360 --> 19:51.610
and actually talk to
him about your problems.

19:53.130 --> 19:54.390
- Then I would have to pay him

19:54.390 --> 19:55.990
instead of the other way around.

19:59.596 --> 20:03.710
- (sighing) A dream
child wandering to a land

20:03.710 --> 20:04.853
far and new.

20:06.691 --> 20:09.110
A friendly chat with bird or beast

20:09.110 --> 20:10.913
and hath believe it true.

20:13.400 --> 20:14.350
- What's that from?

20:15.260 --> 20:16.980
- It's this poem.

20:16.980 --> 20:19.080
I had to memorize it for an English class.

20:19.940 --> 20:21.250
You know, it pops in my head

20:21.250 --> 20:23.640
whenever I get really stressed out.

20:23.640 --> 20:26.093
It just relaxes me, makes me feel better.

20:27.454 --> 20:30.113
- You are one strange girl, Nikki.

20:32.120 --> 20:33.830
- The strangest.

20:33.830 --> 20:38.830
And that's why you love me.

20:38.835 --> 20:41.585
(waves crashing)

21:10.950 --> 21:13.617
(door creaking)

21:28.201 --> 21:31.034
(whimsical music)

21:34.382 --> 21:37.382
(light piano music)

21:53.599 --> 21:58.016
(woman shouting in foreign language)

22:21.012 --> 22:21.845
- Sit.

22:25.320 --> 22:27.357
I told Amy you were an eager one.

22:29.150 --> 22:32.073
She has weaseled her way
into your mind, hasn't she?

22:34.110 --> 22:36.013
She's playing us against each other.

22:37.810 --> 22:40.100
Just give me two weeks

22:40.100 --> 22:43.873
and this whole town will
be crying out your name.

22:45.440 --> 22:47.740
You'll become a fucking
legend, I promise you.

22:49.920 --> 22:53.373
Ah, you're a stubborn one, aren't you?

22:54.520 --> 22:56.690
Just like your father.

22:56.690 --> 22:58.430
- My father?

22:58.430 --> 23:00.060
How'd you know him?

23:00.060 --> 23:01.420
- I'm shocked.

23:01.420 --> 23:02.503
You've forgotten?

23:03.350 --> 23:06.950
Ah of course, you were very, very young.

23:06.950 --> 23:08.930
Rose took you in

23:08.930 --> 23:12.283
and raised you as if you were her own.

23:13.400 --> 23:16.683
Of course, she had her
best interests in mind.

23:19.900 --> 23:22.100
There are things going on here

23:23.340 --> 23:25.493
which are way beyond your control.

23:27.349 --> 23:30.430
There's things you could
never even have imagined

23:30.430 --> 23:32.257
in your darkest fantasies.

23:46.445 --> 23:47.778
Watch your back.

23:49.344 --> 23:54.344
♪ You and I should wait ♪

23:57.699 --> 24:02.699
♪ You and I ♪

24:26.635 --> 24:27.468
- Come.

24:28.912 --> 24:30.547
Come here, come here.

24:30.547 --> 24:32.436
Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick!

24:32.436 --> 24:35.019
Before they see you, come, yes.

24:37.208 --> 24:38.458
Yes, yes, come.

24:39.425 --> 24:40.842
Come, come, come.

24:42.850 --> 24:43.683
Come inside.

24:46.480 --> 24:47.987
You're safe here.

24:47.987 --> 24:49.423
Yes, yes, yes.

24:50.947 --> 24:52.503
You've been through quite the journey.

24:53.346 --> 24:55.004
You look famished.

24:55.004 --> 24:56.224
- Where?

24:56.224 --> 24:57.324
- Here, have some tea.

24:58.823 --> 24:59.890
Yes, yes.

24:59.890 --> 25:02.253
All better. (giggling)

25:06.391 --> 25:07.558
- Who are you?

25:08.610 --> 25:09.443
- Who am I?

25:11.070 --> 25:11.903
Who are you?

25:11.903 --> 25:13.230
- Oh, enough with this nonsense.

25:13.230 --> 25:16.050
I have zero tolerance for games.

25:16.050 --> 25:17.090
- Ready to play?

25:17.090 --> 25:18.880
- You're not making any sense.

25:18.880 --> 25:20.170
- Oh, but I am.

25:20.170 --> 25:25.170
All sense is nonsense. (laughing)

25:25.350 --> 25:26.793
Where did you get this?

25:27.738 --> 25:28.988
- I don't know.

25:30.940 --> 25:31.773
- Here.

25:32.630 --> 25:33.590
Yes, yes.

25:35.268 --> 25:37.370
Here, here, take this too.

25:37.370 --> 25:38.402
You won't need it.

25:38.402 --> 25:41.444
Until you do, until you do. (laughing)

25:41.444 --> 25:43.830
- Which way does this thing go?

25:43.830 --> 25:44.730
- Any way you like.

25:44.730 --> 25:46.620
Up, down, left, right, in, out.

25:46.620 --> 25:50.883
The only difference is it
makes no difference. (laughing)

25:52.810 --> 25:54.260
- [Nikki] I must be dreaming.

25:55.340 --> 25:58.410
- But how can you dream
when you're not asleep?

25:58.410 --> 26:01.350
- This is batshit mental ward crazy.

26:01.350 --> 26:03.180
How the fuck do I get out of here?

26:03.180 --> 26:05.140
- Where do you wanna go?

26:05.140 --> 26:06.530
- Anywhere.

26:06.530 --> 26:07.590
Anywhere but here.

26:07.590 --> 26:09.087
- But which is it?

26:09.087 --> 26:10.447
Anywhere?

26:10.447 --> 26:11.497
Or anywhere but here?

26:12.640 --> 26:13.990
Whatever choice you make is right for you

26:13.990 --> 26:16.070
but I must say if you go right

26:16.070 --> 26:18.540
there's a mad being there today, yes.

26:18.540 --> 26:20.820
- A mad being?

26:20.820 --> 26:21.850
- Yes.

26:21.850 --> 26:23.520
- Okay then I'll go left.

26:23.520 --> 26:24.550
- No, no, no!

26:24.550 --> 26:26.110
Don't go that way.

26:26.110 --> 26:27.700
That's where she is.

26:27.700 --> 26:29.880
And she's even madder. (laughing)

26:29.880 --> 26:34.453
You see, we're all mad here. (laughing)

26:36.969 --> 26:39.360
Oh, I have something for you.

26:39.360 --> 26:41.325
Yes, yes, yes.

26:41.325 --> 26:43.413
Yes, yes, yes, here, here.

26:43.413 --> 26:44.246
Here, take it.

26:44.246 --> 26:45.390
Here, yes, yes, yes.

26:45.390 --> 26:48.638
Open it, open it, yes. (laughing)

26:48.638 --> 26:49.471
It's for you.

26:51.780 --> 26:53.337
- An invitation just for you.

26:53.337 --> 26:55.000
- For you, it's for you.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.363
- The queen wants to see what you can do.

26:58.310 --> 27:00.450
Join us for the Red Rose Roy.

27:00.450 --> 27:02.760
- Join us, yes, yes.

27:02.760 --> 27:04.543
- And happily dance the night away.

27:07.824 --> 27:09.910
Look, I'm not really into dancing,

27:09.910 --> 27:12.483
and yeah, have fun in your tree.

27:13.790 --> 27:14.623
- Travel well.

27:16.850 --> 27:18.520
Bye Nikki! (laughing)

27:18.520 --> 27:19.353
Bye!

27:22.900 --> 27:25.813
Be safe out there! (laughing)

27:28.640 --> 27:29.600
Goodbye!

27:29.600 --> 27:30.563
Bye, Nikki.

27:32.142 --> 27:33.820
Come back soon.

27:33.820 --> 27:35.763
- Why were you in the water?

27:35.763 --> 27:36.596
I got you.

27:37.477 --> 27:38.310
I got you.

27:43.422 --> 27:46.259
(tense music)

27:46.259 --> 27:48.259
What's happening to you?

27:55.320 --> 27:57.313
Nikki, talk to me.

28:00.163 --> 28:00.996
- What?

28:03.630 --> 28:04.830
- You were underwater

28:05.860 --> 28:08.203
I don't know for how
long until I found you.

28:10.510 --> 28:14.640
You seem lost, not there.

28:14.640 --> 28:16.103
I'm worried about you, Nikki.

28:17.220 --> 28:18.193
I can't lose you.

28:19.849 --> 28:22.667
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

28:22.667 --> 28:23.993
- But I saw you.

28:25.180 --> 28:30.180
Still, motionless, almost dead.

28:30.330 --> 28:33.223
Your eyes were open but you were gone.

28:38.660 --> 28:40.593
Why were you trying to drown yourself?

28:42.000 --> 28:42.833
- I wasn't.

28:43.830 --> 28:47.283
I'm the happiest I've ever been, okay?

28:49.000 --> 28:50.233
I love my life.

28:52.257 --> 28:53.230
I don't know what happened,

28:53.230 --> 28:55.080
I must have blacked out or something.

28:56.290 --> 28:57.623
- You're working too hard.

28:58.690 --> 29:01.053
Fuck, we're both working too hard.

29:02.346 --> 29:05.650
Look, soon as I get that grant money,

29:05.650 --> 29:07.000
I wanna take you somewhere.

29:08.564 --> 29:09.764
Somewhere special, okay?

29:10.640 --> 29:13.203
Just you and me.

29:15.460 --> 29:16.293
- Sounds good.

29:18.737 --> 29:21.820
(gentle piano music)

29:24.863 --> 29:26.613
- You had me worried.

29:29.823 --> 29:32.490
(film clicking)

29:34.863 --> 29:36.350
- Nikki closes her eyes

29:36.350 --> 29:38.851
and the memories of the night are erased,

29:38.851 --> 29:41.420
if only for the moment.

29:41.420 --> 29:44.650
A new day begins and a
chance for redemption,

29:44.650 --> 29:47.350
another chance to prove
something to herself.

29:49.764 --> 29:52.729
(crowd applauding)

29:52.729 --> 29:54.544
- Please, and lock it.

29:54.544 --> 29:55.953
Scene one, take one, mark.

29:59.083 --> 29:59.916
Traffic.

30:01.104 --> 30:03.584
- [Director] And action.

30:03.584 --> 30:07.334
(speaks in foreign language)

30:11.420 --> 30:13.870
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for joining us

30:13.870 --> 30:16.790

Before we begin, please welcome

30:18.650 --> 30:22.163
my fabulous co-host, Nikki.

30:23.740 --> 30:26.620
All right, let's get to it, so.

30:26.620 --> 30:27.900
You have some dough here.

30:27.900 --> 30:30.663
Add some nuts to it, right?

30:32.140 --> 30:36.340
Again, mix it and mix
it and mix it, right?

30:36.340 --> 30:39.823
Now, give me your hand, okay.

30:40.690 --> 30:42.310
We're gonna put together okay?

30:43.189 --> 30:44.272
Okay, slowly.

30:45.448 --> 30:47.189
Yeah, that's enough.

30:47.189 --> 30:48.207

Oh, oh, very nice.

(pensive music)

32:41.744 --> 32:44.244
(chill music)

32:48.280 --> 32:49.963
- Don't listen to Edna.

32:50.910 --> 32:54.610
All that sow does is sit
around on her fat ass,

32:54.610 --> 32:56.103
eating away at the profits.

32:57.960 --> 33:00.363
This is showbusiness.

33:01.865 --> 33:05.083
But if you want to join
her sideshow, be my guest.

33:07.150 --> 33:08.433
- Believe me, I don't.

33:09.410 --> 33:10.690
I'm loyal to Rose.

33:10.690 --> 33:14.010
- Don't even mention that
manipulative cunt to me.

33:14.010 --> 33:16.810
We could have run this town.

33:16.810 --> 33:19.620
But she'd rather sit on
her antique high horse

33:19.620 --> 33:21.973
judging people who
aren't stuck in the 50s.

33:23.710 --> 33:26.530
Maybe I'd buy her a rotary phone

33:26.530 --> 33:30.400
so she can call for help
when she's going down, pfft.

33:30.400 --> 33:32.110
- Sure, she's old school but

33:32.110 --> 33:33.500
she's always been like a mother to me.

33:33.500 --> 33:35.003
I can't leave her now.

33:36.240 --> 33:39.160
- Don't you see you're
just a payday to her?

33:39.160 --> 33:41.523
But to me, you're a star.

33:43.130 --> 33:46.380
Rose doesn't care about
you or anybody else.

33:46.380 --> 33:47.453
She's using you.

33:48.920 --> 33:51.120

I would have expected something like this

36:13.470 --> 36:15.713
from Sarah or Greta.

36:17.991 --> 36:18.824
But you,

36:21.720 --> 36:23.670
I always held you so high.

36:26.819 --> 36:28.057
You're my baby girl.

- Save your excuses.

36:38.290 --> 36:40.493
I know how it is out there.

36:41.580 --> 36:42.413
Whatever!

36:43.370 --> 36:45.563
I don't have time for hurt feelings.

36:47.880 --> 36:48.883
Let's have a drink.

36:50.220 --> 36:51.860
For old time's sake.

36:57.610 --> 36:59.453
Could you go any more slowly?

37:02.720 --> 37:05.700
Get down, down, down boy!

37:05.700 --> 37:07.173
- Yes, my lady, sorry, sorry.

37:08.120 --> 37:10.002
- That's all, now bark!

37:10.002 --> 37:10.835
Bark!

37:10.835 --> 37:12.051
(barking) Bark!

37:12.051 --> 37:13.140
Do you know know how to bark?

37:13.140 --> 37:14.710
Have you not heard a fucking dog?

37:14.710 --> 37:15.543
- Woof, woof!

37:15.543 --> 37:16.376
- Woof?

37:16.376 --> 37:17.718
Woof woof?

37:23.191 --> 37:28.191
(Rose growling)
(waiter barking)

37:28.224 --> 37:29.743
- Now crawl, get out, get out, get out!

37:29.743 --> 37:33.333
Crawl, crawl, not walk,
crawl, crawl, crawl!

37:34.926 --> 37:37.676
(waiter barking)

37:39.550 --> 37:41.760
We've had relations.

37:41.760 --> 37:42.593
You know.

37:46.470 --> 37:48.970
(tense music)

37:50.120 --> 37:51.803
To new beginnings.

37:53.984 --> 37:54.979
(glasses clinking)

37:54.979 --> 37:58.180
- [Narrator] Rose gave
Nikki her first taste.

37:58.180 --> 37:59.903
She'll never be the same.

38:01.400 --> 38:02.513
- Swallow.

38:05.325 --> 38:07.575
(whirring)

38:09.984 --> 38:11.537
(gavel banging)

38:11.537 --> 38:13.481
- Silence in court!

38:13.481 --> 38:14.314
Silence!

38:15.180 --> 38:17.710
The court has come to a decision.

38:17.710 --> 38:20.930
Nikki, as punishment for her crimes

38:20.930 --> 38:23.639
must give eternal servitude to the queen.

38:23.639 --> 38:25.920
Any failure to do so

38:25.920 --> 38:29.284
or attempt at escape will result in quick

38:29.284 --> 38:31.147
and painful death.

38:31.147 --> 38:32.070
- No!

38:32.070 --> 38:33.446
You can't do this!

38:33.446 --> 38:34.910
(gavel banging)

38:34.910 --> 38:36.642
- [Judge] Court in session, silence!

38:36.642 --> 38:37.870
- Silence!

38:37.870 --> 38:40.650
- There is an exception if you so please.

38:40.650 --> 38:43.780
If you can complete the queens challenges,

38:43.780 --> 38:44.630
you'll walk free.

38:45.520 --> 38:47.650
But if you fail to do so,

38:47.650 --> 38:51.900
you Nikki, will be sent
to eternal quarantine.

38:51.900 --> 38:53.530
What is your decision?

38:53.530 --> 38:54.801
- Bring it on!

38:54.801 --> 38:57.051
- Let the challenges begin!

38:57.920 --> 39:01.420

I thought this was your queendom.

39:53.976 --> 39:56.559
(exotic music)

40:08.401 --> 40:11.984
(song in foreign language)

40:16.360 --> 40:19.483
- [Narrator] This magical
green substance is her escape.

40:20.560 --> 40:23.050
It seems to make everything okay

40:23.050 --> 40:24.882
at least for the time being.

40:24.882 --> 40:27.049
(wailing)

41:44.355 --> 41:45.854
There you are.

41:45.854 --> 41:47.483
I thought you'd never come.

41:50.550 --> 41:53.920
Didn't anyone tell you
this was a mad party?

41:53.920 --> 41:56.160
A party of epic proportions

41:56.160 --> 41:59.330
and tea party! (shrieking)

41:59.330 --> 42:02.220
- Hey oh, wasn't my fault that I was late,

I tried to be here on time.

42:03.800 --> 42:05.590
But it's not my fault, it's not my fault.

are getting more intense.

45:03.980 --> 45:05.880
It's hard to tell what's real anymore.

45:06.960 --> 45:09.490
Will she decide to stay
in this fantasy realm

45:09.490 --> 45:11.343
or will she face her true reality?

45:13.700 --> 45:14.970
Behind the glitz and glam

45:14.970 --> 45:16.783
there's a darkness that follows her.

45:17.730 --> 45:19.360
A world where she's a prisoner

46:44.200 --> 46:46.693
I'd never forget a face like yours.

something was off with Greta.

But she just trusted.

53:15.100 --> 53:17.133
They were friends no matter what.

- Bravo!

53:32.040 --> 53:33.920

56:23.543 --> 56:24.376
All right.

56:24.376 --> 56:25.914
- Taste this!

56:25.914 --> 56:27.914
You sick, maniacal fuck!

56:30.492 --> 56:32.742
(groaning)

56:33.706 --> 56:37.873
(chef speaks in foreign language)

56:41.894 --> 56:42.727
Bastard!

56:49.012 --> 56:51.512
(tense music)

57:02.153 --> 57:03.061
You sick fuck.

57:03.061 --> 57:06.060
You maniacal motherfucker.

57:06.060 --> 57:07.060
You bastard!

57:10.360 --> 57:11.813
- Get your hands off him!

57:15.718 --> 57:18.551
Who the fuck do you think you are?

57:19.620 --> 57:21.420
You think you can just come into our world

57:21.420 --> 57:23.820
and destroy everything that
Kemper and I have built?

57:23.820 --> 57:26.290
- You ungrateful harlot.

57:26.290 --> 57:28.623
Did you forget about
the contract you signed?

57:29.780 --> 57:31.943
You're mine now, forever!

57:32.970 --> 57:34.533
To do with as I please!

57:50.870 --> 57:52.993
You'll soon learn your place.

57:54.150 --> 57:55.970
- How could you do this to us?

57:55.970 --> 57:58.520
To me after everything
that we've been through!

57:58.520 --> 58:01.130
- I don't know you and I
don't wanna fucking know you.

58:01.130 --> 58:03.190
You stay the fuck away from me!

58:03.190 --> 58:05.233
- You've left me no choice.

58:11.298 --> 58:13.965
(Greta gasping)

58:16.752 --> 58:18.465
You shouldn't have done that.

58:18.465 --> 58:20.240
- Nikki, darling.

58:20.240 --> 58:23.065
It's a shame we could not work things out.

58:23.065 --> 58:25.130
You had so much potential.

58:25.130 --> 58:28.180
- You've ruined everything.

58:28.180 --> 58:30.583
This was our shot at the big time.

58:35.260 --> 58:36.093
- Finish her!

58:36.093 --> 58:36.926
- No!

58:38.659 --> 58:41.242
(heroic music)

58:42.223 --> 58:44.390
(bashing)

58:46.575 --> 58:47.658
I'm so sorry.

58:49.043 --> 58:50.743
I feared this was going to happen.

58:52.106 --> 58:53.856
I should have never left your side.

58:57.370 --> 58:58.270
What should we do?

59:00.930 --> 59:05.333
- Let's teach that
self-righteous prick a lesson!

59:13.130 --> 59:14.930
Sweet dreams, asshole.

59:14.930 --> 59:17.023
- [Narrator] Nikki
started at the beginning.

59:17.870 --> 59:20.540
She's reached the end and
now she's ready to stop.

59:39.431 --> 59:44.431
(melancholy piano music)
(whooshing)

59:45.040 --> 59:46.963
No longer stuck in her mind.

59:48.200 --> 59:51.483
Her body no longer merely a toy.

59:52.670 --> 59:56.723
The power is hers, free.
