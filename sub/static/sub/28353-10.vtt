00:15.306 --> 00:16.725
You're ass dumber than I thought.

00:16.808 --> 00:18.688
You weren't saying that
when I had a gun on you.

00:19.894 --> 00:21.896
You tell all your homies
how you pissed yourself?

00:23.023 --> 00:24.623
Your ass couldn't even pull the trigger.

00:26.151 --> 00:28.028
You're soft, ese.

00:28.987 --> 00:30.071
But don't worry,

00:30.655 --> 00:31.990
'cause after I merc you,

00:33.533 --> 00:34.951
I'ma take your bitch.

00:36.327 --> 00:38.747
So she can finally see what
it's like to be with a man...

00:39.748 --> 00:41.332
instead of a pussy.

00:41.416 --> 00:43.001
- Oh, I'm the pussy.
- Yeah.

00:43.084 --> 00:44.252
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:44.335 --> 00:47.213
Which one of us walked
into a room full of dudes

00:47.297 --> 00:48.548
he knows are strapped?

00:50.425 --> 00:52.635
And which one of us
shot two innocent kids

00:53.344 --> 00:54.512
at a birthday party?

01:00.143 --> 01:01.352
You're nothing but a pussy.

01:02.520 --> 01:04.813
Hey, hey, hey! Not up in here!

01:05.440 --> 01:06.858
Hey, take him to the back.

01:07.275 --> 01:08.693
- Gonna beat yo' ass!
- To the back.

01:09.100 --> 01:10.153
Move your shit.

01:10.170 --> 01:12.781
Shoot yo' ass like I did
your bitch-ass friend!

01:49.692 --> 01:50.692
Stand up.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.115
Look a man in the eye
when he talkin' to you.

02:12.090 --> 02:13.716
Tell me, little Spooky.

02:16.261 --> 02:18.304
What do you think a
man is? Are you a man?

02:21.975 --> 02:23.020
I know I am.

02:23.268 --> 02:24.268
No.

02:24.811 --> 02:26.271
A man don't snitch.

02:27.188 --> 02:30.775
The only thing worse than a Santo
is a snitch. And you're both!

02:31.151 --> 02:34.195
So get back on your knees like the
bitch you are and start praying.

02:39.033 --> 02:40.033
Let's do this!

02:47.917 --> 02:49.210
Yo, Spooky.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.713
While you paying to save your brother...

02:53.000 --> 02:54.100
he ratting you out.

02:57.343 --> 02:58.678
So now we got your money...

02:59.304 --> 03:00.346
and his money.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.850
We know about the stash house on Hardy.

03:04.684 --> 03:05.894
And who your connect is.

03:09.480 --> 03:13.480
It's gonna be a good day.

03:23.745 --> 03:24.829
We're done.

03:28.583 --> 03:29.876
Cash is all here.

03:33.460 --> 03:35.540
Pleasure doing business with you.

03:41.304 --> 03:42.555
Don't say anything.

03:42.639 --> 03:43.723
Not a damn thing.

04:56.629 --> 04:57.755
I love you, mano.

05:02.010 --> 05:03.094
But you're done.

05:10.393 --> 05:11.393
Happy birthday.

05:28.911 --> 05:31.372
You need to do something
bigger than the mess you made.

05:38.004 --> 05:39.213
What?

05:42.342 --> 05:43.426
Do you wanna do this?

05:44.427 --> 05:46.637
You got to do something
bigger to prove yourself.

05:47.889 --> 05:49.265
What if I got you 50 grand?

05:51.184 --> 05:52.744
Where are you gonna get cash like that?

05:53.686 --> 05:54.937
What if I already had it?

05:56.606 --> 05:57.606
I'm listening.

06:00.109 --> 06:01.986
My friends found the RollerWorld money.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.364
They washed it.

06:04.770 --> 06:05.823
It's clean.

06:05.850 --> 06:07.617
RollerWorld. Don't shit me!

06:13.289 --> 06:14.289
For real?

06:15.541 --> 06:16.541
RollerWorld?

06:17.668 --> 06:19.670
Is that why your boy kept
asking about Lil' Ricky?

06:22.548 --> 06:23.548
Yeah.

06:27.345 --> 06:28.345
Damn.

06:30.348 --> 06:31.348
Damn!

06:35.061 --> 06:36.729
How far are you willing to go?

06:36.813 --> 06:37.939
I'll do anything.

06:40.733 --> 06:42.193
Then this is what we're going to do.

06:42.902 --> 06:44.654
I'll run the plan by Cuchillos.

06:45.113 --> 06:47.448
Without a blessing, there's
no point in taking the risk.

06:47.532 --> 06:48.532
Understood.

06:49.075 --> 06:50.618
If this goes wrong, it's on me.

06:51.327 --> 06:52.327
I accept that.

06:56.290 --> 06:58.209
You gotta be incredibly careful.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.462
Your friends have to think
you're going away forever.

07:01.546 --> 07:02.560
Cesar!

07:02.588 --> 07:03.588
This protects them.

07:04.382 --> 07:06.050
- And if anything happens to you...
- Go to hell!

07:06.134 --> 07:07.414
... they won't know you're dead.

07:07.927 --> 07:09.637
Make it look like you're leaving.

07:09.720 --> 07:10.888
When it's clear,

07:11.639 --> 07:12.639
I'll be there.

07:13.900 --> 07:15.650
You'll make contact with the Prophet$

07:15.658 --> 07:17.061
and I'll exchange your clean money

07:17.145 --> 07:19.647
with the marked bills from
the Freeridge Savings heist.

07:19.730 --> 07:20.898
The plan is in effect.

07:23.151 --> 07:25.528
- What's that?
- Another 150 grand from your boys...

07:25.950 --> 07:27.020
which I'm gonna keep.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.740
Getting all that clean
cash gave me the idea

07:29.824 --> 07:32.201
that we can lay off more of the
dirty money with the Prophet$.

07:32.285 --> 07:33.703
No one's gonna believe a kid like me

07:33.786 --> 07:35.955
would stumble in with
200 Gs strapped to him.

07:36.539 --> 07:37.539
You won't have to.

07:38.499 --> 07:39.792
You handle this 50,

07:39.876 --> 07:41.669
- I'll handle the rest.
- You?

07:42.503 --> 07:45.173
Cuchillos is calling the Prophet$'
OG. Setting a meeting for me.

07:45.250 --> 07:46.649
So I'll be there buying your protection

07:46.650 --> 07:48.176
while you're there ratting me out.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.400
We'll get the heat off of you,

07:50.410 --> 07:52.400
maybe take a few of them
down with the dirty money.

07:52.680 --> 07:54.050
You think it'll work?

07:55.308 --> 07:56.308
It has to.

07:57.059 --> 07:58.060
Or we're both dead.

08:01.898 --> 08:03.191
You good?

08:03.649 --> 08:05.401
No, I'm not good.

08:05.485 --> 08:08.654
You gave our RollerWorld
money to the Prophet$!

08:08.738 --> 08:11.491
No. I gave them the marked bills
from the Freeridge Savings robbery.

08:11.782 --> 08:13.618
Oh! Thank God.

08:13.910 --> 08:16.787
For a second I thought
you gave our money away.

08:16.871 --> 08:18.664
No, I didn't give your money away.

08:19.957 --> 08:22.126
You gave your money away,
and now it's mine.

08:23.044 --> 08:25.296
Ruby! Turn me to Jamal.

08:26.297 --> 08:27.398
Am I hearing this correctly?

08:27.798 --> 08:30.510
You used all of our money
for nothing? Even my 50K?

08:30.593 --> 08:31.677
It wasn't for nothing.

08:31.761 --> 08:32.761
It was for Cesar.

08:32.845 --> 08:34.388
And yes, even your 50K.

08:34.472 --> 08:35.556
Turn me to Spooky.

08:37.558 --> 08:39.227
More. I still can see him.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.240
Spooky.

08:42.395 --> 08:45.107
I did not sign off on my 50
grand of that gift to you.

08:45.191 --> 08:47.276
- Can you be decent and give it back?
- No.

08:47.670 --> 08:48.736
This is bullshit!

08:48.819 --> 08:50.029
Look on the bright side.

08:50.112 --> 08:52.365
- Cesar's alive.
- Hurray! Turn me to him.

08:52.448 --> 08:53.699
No.

08:54.617 --> 08:55.785
You might be alive,

08:55.868 --> 08:57.369
- but you're dead to me.
- Monse.

08:57.370 --> 08:58.390
I am so...

09:00.665 --> 09:02.291
- ... dead.
- Spooky,

09:02.375 --> 09:04.710
do you think giving the Prophet$ a
bunch of marked bills was wise?

09:04.794 --> 09:07.463
Once one of their guys gets arrested,
then they'll know it was you.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.799
- And by extension, us.
- They'll never connect it to you.

09:09.882 --> 09:12.134
I still don't understand why
you needed to cheat us.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.554
I didn't. I did exactly what you wanted.

09:14.637 --> 09:16.264
- I saved Cesar.
- Okay.

09:16.347 --> 09:19.475
But you knew you were going to do
that before you took our cash.

09:19.559 --> 09:22.270
- And your point is?
- Taking our money is unscrupulous.

09:22.353 --> 09:24.313
How many times do I have
to spell this out for you?

09:24.397 --> 09:26.857
Your money is actually my money.
It belongs to the Santos.

09:26.941 --> 09:29.235
Oh! You really want to play that game?

09:29.318 --> 09:32.446
Well, if we get into logistics,
it's really Prophet$ money

09:32.530 --> 09:34.615
that you stole from us!

09:34.620 --> 09:35.630
Well, actually,

09:35.640 --> 09:36.879
it's a bunch of random people's money

09:36.880 --> 09:38.661
who paid way too much for a bad concert.

09:38.744 --> 09:39.954
Shalamar's the shit!

09:40.037 --> 09:41.789
These people probably didn't pay enough.

09:41.872 --> 09:43.082
Relax.

09:43.666 --> 09:45.209
We're not going to forget you helped us.

09:45.293 --> 09:48.212
I don't care about your
goodwill. I want my money!

09:49.380 --> 09:50.423
But I cooked for you.

09:50.506 --> 09:51.799
You made ceviche!

09:52.133 --> 09:53.968
Okay? The juice does all the cooking.

09:54.320 --> 09:55.370
Come on, Ruby.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.680
Uh... But we haven't eaten yet.

09:57.763 --> 09:58.763
Now!

10:02.268 --> 10:04.228
Why do I even listen to you?

10:04.312 --> 10:06.772
Me? You have no one to
blame but yourself.

10:06.856 --> 10:08.608
It was your idea to trade
the money for Cesar.

10:08.691 --> 10:10.234
And it was your idea to bring donuts!

10:10.318 --> 10:12.069
I was being a good guest!

10:12.153 --> 10:14.322
You don't walk into someone's
house empty-handed.

10:14.405 --> 10:17.116
And why is that even relevant?
Spooky did what we asked.

10:17.199 --> 10:18.284
He saved Cesar.

10:18.367 --> 10:20.494
- Does it really matter how he did it?
- Yes!

10:20.578 --> 10:22.955
Our money is lying around

10:23.030 --> 10:25.300
or being used to buy an excessive amount

10:25.310 --> 10:27.627
of colorless tanks and long shorts?

10:27.710 --> 10:30.588
I don't understand why
you're not more upset!

10:30.671 --> 10:33.090
Think about Olivia. Did she die in vain?

10:34.050 --> 10:36.260
Don't bring her up. You
weren't even there.

10:36.344 --> 10:38.512
Yeah, 'cause y'all didn't believe in me.

10:38.596 --> 10:40.056
'Cause you didn't have my back.

10:40.139 --> 10:41.849
Yeah, that's right.
We're back on my back.

10:41.932 --> 10:44.393
Seriously? I can't with you.

10:44.477 --> 10:48.439
Didn't have your back. Now
watch mine as I walk away.

10:48.522 --> 10:50.441
No! Watch mine! See it?

10:51.108 --> 10:52.443
No! Mine!

10:55.905 --> 10:56.905
Hey, Rube!

10:58.157 --> 10:59.157
What?

11:00.493 --> 11:02.036
- Ha, ha!
- Damn it!

11:11.128 --> 11:12.380
Cheers!

11:15.424 --> 11:16.424
Ah.

11:20.930 --> 11:22.056
Hey, thank you.

11:22.723 --> 11:23.723
It was nothing.

11:24.141 --> 11:25.518
Not talking about the food.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.481
I don't say this very
often, but I, uh...

11:30.564 --> 11:31.691
I know.

11:38.155 --> 11:39.740
I'm not made for this life, Oscar.

11:44.662 --> 11:46.205
Listen to me, please.

11:47.915 --> 11:49.083
When that gun jammed,

11:50.751 --> 11:52.169
God gave me a second chance.

11:53.337 --> 11:54.630
And I can't ignore it.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.133
And?

12:02.138 --> 12:04.515
And I never want to be a
liability to you ever again.

12:08.561 --> 12:09.729
I love you, mano.

12:12.640 --> 12:14.660
But I am not a killer.

12:32.550 --> 12:38.420
_

13:28.224 --> 13:29.350
Dude, stop!

13:29.934 --> 13:32.895
We were stupid, okay? We never
should've given the money away.

13:32.978 --> 13:36.398
Spooky sucks and in a head-to-head
dance off, you'd win.

13:36.482 --> 13:39.151
Let me get back to business
and make some mayonnaise.

13:39.235 --> 13:40.861
- Ew!
- Monse?

13:40.945 --> 13:42.613
Is your junk out?

13:43.656 --> 13:44.907
Oh, my God. Put it away.

13:45.950 --> 13:47.076
Is it away?

13:47.159 --> 13:48.410
- Yes.
- You swear?

13:48.494 --> 13:49.494
Get to it!

13:50.037 --> 13:52.373
Okay. I've been stewing on
something and as my oldest friend,

13:52.456 --> 13:53.707
I need you to tell me the truth.

13:53.790 --> 13:56.180
Who was that girl that Cesar slept
with while I was in Brentwood?

13:56.200 --> 13:57.290
No idea.

13:57.294 --> 13:59.046
I found out about it right when you did.

13:59.713 --> 14:01.549
Ask Jamal. Maybe he knows.

14:01.700 --> 14:02.758
Thanks.

14:02.770 --> 14:04.682
- You can bring your penis back out now.
- Hey.

14:05.386 --> 14:07.763
I tell me when I can
bring my penis back out.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.431
And I already did.

14:12.309 --> 14:14.854
You are the master of your own reality.

14:15.104 --> 14:17.314
Abundance belongs to you.

14:17.398 --> 14:19.525
Expand your consciousness.

14:19.550 --> 14:20.579
Hey.

14:20.580 --> 14:22.778
I'm sorry I wasn't cool
about my 50 grand.

14:23.360 --> 14:24.840
I've just been on edge since I found out

14:24.850 --> 14:26.657
about the whole Cesar other-girl sitch.

14:26.740 --> 14:27.741
Yeah, that was lame.

14:27.825 --> 14:29.159
Yeah. Who was she?

14:29.243 --> 14:30.494
I... I don't know.

14:30.578 --> 14:33.455
- But he said he told you about it.
- Oh. Yeah, he did.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.124
- You knew?
- Damn it, woman!

14:35.207 --> 14:36.292
This is entrapment!

14:36.375 --> 14:37.376
What's her Instagram?

14:37.459 --> 14:39.128
I don't know. She was a Dwayn-ee.

14:39.211 --> 14:40.880
- So this is your fault.
- My fault?

14:40.963 --> 14:42.548
I... I wasn't even there!

14:42.882 --> 14:44.300
I mean, there the...

14:44.884 --> 14:46.802
I didn't know anything until after.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.804
Okay, that's it. State of the Union now.

14:48.888 --> 14:49.920
Hold on, please.

14:50.264 --> 14:52.099
Ugh.

14:52.182 --> 14:53.601
- What?
- I've got Jamal.

14:53.684 --> 14:55.811
- Shimmy your pants back on.
- No need, I'm freeballin'.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.479
- What happened?
- Oh, I don't know.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.565
- A breach in our friendship.
- What did we do to you?

14:59.648 --> 15:01.692
Nothing! But Cesar made
an irreparable mistake.

15:01.775 --> 15:04.486
So that leaves us with one option.
You're gonna have to pick a side.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.071
- Why?
- Because he slept with a hoochie!

15:06.363 --> 15:08.908
- But you broke up with him!
- After he gave me an ultimatum!

15:08.991 --> 15:10.534
This feels like a legit gray area.

15:10.610 --> 15:11.779
You know, you guys
wouldn't even be friends

15:11.780 --> 15:12.879
with Cesar if it weren't for me.

15:12.880 --> 15:14.914
- You de-friended him.
- In your honor.

15:14.990 --> 15:16.860
But I forced the reconciliation,

15:16.880 --> 15:18.439
which means I'm the mother of this ship,

15:18.440 --> 15:19.835
and it's time to get in my life raft

15:19.919 --> 15:22.504
because our friendship
has hit a major iceberg.

15:22.588 --> 15:23.799
So, are you sinking or swimming?

15:23.800 --> 15:24.811
As someone who can't swim,

15:24.812 --> 15:26.859
I refuse to engage in
metaphorical drowning scenarios.

15:27.259 --> 15:28.427
I'm not gonna debate this anymore.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.638
You have 48 hours to decide
which team you're on.

15:30.721 --> 15:32.514
Technically, that's also an ultimatum.

15:41.250 --> 15:42.358
What?

15:42.441 --> 15:44.193
The IRS will garnish your wages

15:44.276 --> 15:45.903
- if you don't immediately call...
- Ugh!

15:45.986 --> 15:50.324
... 1-888-514-5555.

15:50.407 --> 15:52.409
- Again, the IRS will...
- Ah!

15:53.577 --> 15:55.829
You're really making them pick sides?

15:56.121 --> 15:58.832
Please, don't punish them. Look,
I'm the only one to blame.

15:58.916 --> 16:01.669
I never should've done what I did.
It's my life's biggest regret.

16:01.750 --> 16:03.300
You just tried to kill someone

16:03.310 --> 16:04.920
and that is your life's biggest regret?

16:04.930 --> 16:08.634
Monse, I'm so sorry. Please,
just let me fix this.

16:09.468 --> 16:10.468
Okay.

16:11.136 --> 16:12.638
I can see an option for redemption.

16:13.263 --> 16:14.263
Anything.

16:15.182 --> 16:16.182
You can suck a butt.

16:17.184 --> 16:19.520
We just need to let the woman calm down.

16:19.603 --> 16:22.356
With time and space,
she'll come to her senses.

16:22.439 --> 16:24.525
This is Monse we're talking about.

16:24.608 --> 16:28.654
Stop trying to ascribe rational
thoughts to an irrational person.

16:28.737 --> 16:29.863
All right.

16:29.947 --> 16:30.990
You're right.

16:31.073 --> 16:32.825
- I'll stop.
- This is crazy.

16:32.908 --> 16:35.536
Two days ago, all we wanted
was for Cesar to be alive.

16:35.619 --> 16:38.038
And now all Monse wants
is for him to drop dead.

16:38.122 --> 16:40.124
Well, figuratively.

16:40.207 --> 16:42.209
Maybe not. TBD.

16:42.292 --> 16:45.546
You know, all this petty bullshit
is making me want to pick a side.

16:45.629 --> 16:48.882
Spoiler alert, I'll take
Broody over Moody any day.

16:48.966 --> 16:50.426
I'm exhausted. Talk later?

16:50.509 --> 16:51.509
Peace.

17:01.270 --> 17:02.730
This is the end of an era.

17:19.099 --> 17:20.150
Remember this?

17:20.170 --> 17:21.915
It's a story you wrote
in the fourth grade.

17:22.410 --> 17:24.180
You thought you lost it, but...

17:24.200 --> 17:25.260
you didn't.

17:25.599 --> 17:26.700
I took it.

17:26.878 --> 17:29.423
I used to read it every night
before I went to sleep.

17:30.920 --> 17:33.000
Because I felt like I had
a little piece of you

17:33.010 --> 17:34.428
to keep me safe at night.

17:44.813 --> 17:47.524
Monse, you've always owned my heart.

17:48.859 --> 17:49.859
Then...

17:50.819 --> 17:51.819
and now.

17:53.405 --> 17:55.240
Nothing's ever going to change that.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.036
Nothing...

18:00.162 --> 18:01.371
except a two-bit ho.

18:02.331 --> 18:06.043
Okay, I can see how you'd feel that
way and you have every right to.

18:06.120 --> 18:07.619
I'm just hoping that
you'll take a moment

18:07.620 --> 18:09.296
and listen less to your head

18:09.379 --> 18:10.672
an... and more at your heart.

18:10.756 --> 18:12.758
If you take a moment and
listen more to your heart,

18:12.841 --> 18:13.884
you'll feel...

18:15.344 --> 18:16.470
She can't hear you.

18:17.471 --> 18:18.555
She's making a snack.

18:19.681 --> 18:21.141
I couldn't leave you hanging.

18:22.601 --> 18:23.921
It was getting real embarrassing.

18:24.645 --> 18:25.645
Hmm.

18:28.440 --> 18:29.441
Okay.

18:33.195 --> 18:34.195
Hey.

18:35.072 --> 18:36.365
I heard what's going on.

18:37.074 --> 18:38.074
Great.

18:38.659 --> 18:41.839
You're doing the right thing. You
gotta stand up for yourself, girl.

18:41.840 --> 18:43.100
And if those jokers
can't see your worth,

18:43.120 --> 18:45.582
then you need to dip
on down to girl town.

18:45.666 --> 18:46.699
Thanks.

18:46.700 --> 18:48.859
Listen, I know you're
not much to look at,

18:48.860 --> 18:50.500
but underneath all that "meh"

18:50.504 --> 18:53.215
is a smidge of cool and something
resembling a personality.

18:53.298 --> 18:54.508
And you know how I know that?

18:54.591 --> 18:55.884
Enlighten me, Jasmine.

18:57.678 --> 18:58.678
'Cause I see you.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.472
- You see me?
- Yeah.

19:00.556 --> 19:02.933
And what I see is a girl who
has lost her main girl.

19:03.350 --> 19:05.102
But you need to know that
there are other girls.

19:05.185 --> 19:06.979
Girls who not only have
great tips on how to...

19:07.062 --> 19:08.856
smooth out that frizzy
Frappuccino on your lid,

19:08.939 --> 19:11.859
but who would be happy to be
your number one incoming call

19:11.942 --> 19:14.736
and have you be that number
one outgoing. You feel me?

19:16.947 --> 19:17.947
Yeah.

19:18.365 --> 19:19.616
Yeah, ironically I do.

19:20.284 --> 19:22.077
- I need friends on the same level.
- Yes!

19:22.161 --> 19:24.746
Friends who get who I am
about and appreciate me.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.832
Why am I always fighting
for my friendship?

19:26.915 --> 19:28.667
'Cause the problem with
running with an all-male crew

19:28.750 --> 19:31.380
is that you ain't ever gonna get
to be you. Not the real you!

19:31.400 --> 19:32.579
Ain't none of those dudes gonna help you

19:32.580 --> 19:34.280
dig that tampon out
when it goes missing.

19:34.300 --> 19:36.480
Hell no! That's your girl's gig.

19:36.508 --> 19:38.552
Your girl who gets you and sees you

19:38.635 --> 19:40.888
and will be there to comfort
you when you realize that...

19:42.139 --> 19:43.307
... it's just lost, mija.

19:43.974 --> 19:46.059
That bloody cotton is gone forever.

19:47.519 --> 19:50.230
You're absolutely right, Jas. I feel
like I'm having an epiphany now.

19:50.314 --> 19:51.815
Things have changed. I've changed.

19:51.899 --> 19:53.275
That's what I'm talking about, Mons.

19:53.290 --> 19:54.400
No matter what side the guys take,

19:54.410 --> 19:56.278
it's time for me to
find a new girlfriend.

19:56.361 --> 19:57.863
- Mm-hmm.
- Or maybe a few.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.076
Damn, she's dense.

20:24.770 --> 20:26.060
_

20:28.230 --> 20:32.360
_

20:35.400 --> 20:36.568
Even Steven.

20:37.152 --> 20:39.403
And we only have until morning
to make our final call.

20:39.404 --> 20:40.655
_

20:40.656 --> 20:41.865
Then let's let fate decide.

20:42.574 --> 20:43.575
Heads Cesar, tails Monse?

20:44.034 --> 20:45.410
That feels disrespectful.

20:45.494 --> 20:46.620
Cesar should be tails.

20:47.537 --> 20:48.789
Ah!

20:49.331 --> 20:50.832
- What is it?
- Mine.

20:50.916 --> 20:52.542
You still owe me $42.

20:52.626 --> 20:53.794
Okay, I'm done.

20:53.877 --> 20:56.380
I'm not taking sides in this stupid war.

20:56.463 --> 20:59.049
By forcing us to make a decision,
Monse's already made one for us.

20:59.132 --> 21:00.342
Exactly!

21:01.343 --> 21:02.511
What's the decision?

21:03.053 --> 21:05.030
Man, I just don't understand girls.

21:05.380 --> 21:06.420
Bitches be bonkers.

21:06.473 --> 21:08.392
Well, except you.

21:08.475 --> 21:10.477
I mean, you believed in
me when no one else did.

21:10.560 --> 21:14.815
Ah, to be fair, I also believe
in chupacabra and UFOs.

21:14.898 --> 21:18.277
Someday I'll have to tell you
about the time I got abducted.

21:18.652 --> 21:21.280
Abuelita, I feel so depressed.

21:21.363 --> 21:22.364
Why?

21:22.440 --> 21:23.940
Because of this friend nonsense?

21:23.950 --> 21:25.260
Oh, no, I don't care about my friends.

21:25.534 --> 21:27.661
I'm talking RollerWorld. I mean...

21:28.412 --> 21:29.496
with RollerWorld...

21:31.123 --> 21:33.917
there was a mystery
and I could solve it.

21:34.001 --> 21:36.169
I had purpose, meaning.

21:37.004 --> 21:39.047
Now I'm... I'm just Jamal.

21:39.798 --> 21:41.341
Jamal the Freeridge freshman.

21:41.425 --> 21:43.844
This is life, my friend.

21:44.428 --> 21:46.763
You can't go looking for your purpose.

21:47.431 --> 21:48.724
Your purpose finds you.

21:51.852 --> 21:54.062
So she pissed the bed.

21:54.146 --> 21:56.773
You know what my boy Angel
does? He piss on the bed, too.

22:11.038 --> 22:12.038
Hey.

22:29.222 --> 22:31.767
So, I've been thinking and...

22:32.250 --> 22:33.310
the more I think,

22:33.320 --> 22:36.033
the more I don't know what I would've
done if I were in your shoes.

22:39.858 --> 22:41.151
I just need to know one thing.

22:46.740 --> 22:48.325
Did you love me when you did it?

22:50.077 --> 22:51.995
I never stopped loving you.

22:53.622 --> 22:56.625
Monse, I was in the lowest
place I've ever been.

23:00.087 --> 23:01.367
I thought you were gone forever.

23:04.383 --> 23:06.676
I know. It doesn't make it okay.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.262
But it's the truth.

23:14.935 --> 23:15.936
Thank you.

23:22.943 --> 23:24.111
Wait. Where you going?

23:28.532 --> 23:29.532
I forgive you.

23:30.742 --> 23:31.785
But I can't forget.

23:34.538 --> 23:36.248
'Cause if you loved me
and you did that...

23:38.041 --> 23:39.292
what else would you do?

23:49.000 --> 23:50.120
You don't have to make a decision.

23:50.140 --> 23:52.556
But you can't nultimatum an ultimatum.

23:52.630 --> 23:54.560
Ruby, see? This is her thunder stealing

23:54.580 --> 23:55.960
that I said should go on the con list.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.310
I'm sorry I put you through the paces.

23:57.390 --> 23:58.680
No one should make their
friends take sides.

23:58.700 --> 24:01.464
As expected. I also said she'd wind up

24:01.465 --> 24:03.859
somehow looking like the bigger person.

24:03.942 --> 24:06.611
I've made an important decision
of my own that I want to share.

24:06.695 --> 24:08.071
I've just...

24:23.470 --> 24:24.546
What's going on?

24:24.629 --> 24:25.755
It was a take down!

24:26.131 --> 24:28.758
The cash, the drugs, the
guns, and illegal ferrets.

24:28.842 --> 24:30.177
The place was a scene.

24:30.260 --> 24:31.261
It was sick!

24:31.970 --> 24:33.930
But why are all the
Prophet$ getting arrested?

24:33.950 --> 24:35.540
Remember the robbery
at Freeridge Savings?

24:35.550 --> 24:36.850
The guys in the monster masks?

24:36.933 --> 24:38.143
Well, that money was marked.

24:38.477 --> 24:40.604
And we've been tracking any money spent.

24:40.687 --> 24:43.190
First, we caught Mr. Gutierrez in
his liquor store with the dough.

24:43.273 --> 24:44.900
Turns out that money
was from a customer.

24:44.980 --> 24:47.460
And when those marked bills started
popping up all around town,

24:47.470 --> 24:48.864
right before the Prophet$ hood day,

24:48.865 --> 24:50.489
we were able to trace
it right back to them.

24:50.572 --> 24:52.574
So now the Prophet$ are no más!

24:52.657 --> 24:54.951
- All of them?
- Hell, yeah! We took 'em all down.

24:55.035 --> 24:56.495
The Prophet$ are Donezel Washington.

24:56.578 --> 24:58.330
Holy shit.

24:58.413 --> 25:00.290
Oh, actually, check out this link.

25:00.373 --> 25:01.500
It's got the best footages.

25:01.583 --> 25:02.751
Bring the next group out!

25:02.834 --> 25:04.461
Y'all don't even got probable cause.

25:04.544 --> 25:06.379
Coming through. Start loading 'em in.

25:07.214 --> 25:08.214
Wow.

25:09.007 --> 25:10.247
They even got Latrelle.

25:11.343 --> 25:12.719
Let's go! Keep moving!

25:14.262 --> 25:16.556
Yeah. He's going away for a long time.

25:20.018 --> 25:22.145
Hey, yo, Esteban! Why no call back?

25:22.229 --> 25:24.439
I don't send pics of my
chonies to no phonies!

25:27.400 --> 25:28.400
How you feeling?

25:33.698 --> 25:34.698
It's...

25:35.450 --> 25:36.701
pretty surreal.

25:38.411 --> 25:40.664
I thought about this day for so long,

25:41.248 --> 25:42.707
praying for revenge.

25:43.500 --> 25:44.501
But this...

25:45.335 --> 25:47.254
this doesn't make me feel anything.

25:48.588 --> 25:50.006
It's not going to bring her back.

25:50.507 --> 25:52.509
I mean, what's the point of it all?

25:52.592 --> 25:53.885
Latrelle took a life.

25:54.553 --> 25:55.679
Now his life's over.

25:56.513 --> 25:57.513
And look at us.

25:58.056 --> 26:00.725
The second we're not worrying
about Cesar's death,

26:00.809 --> 26:02.978
we're sweating the small stuff.

26:03.478 --> 26:05.146
We lost sight of the bigger picture.

26:05.230 --> 26:08.483
How lucky we are to be
alive... with each other.

26:11.027 --> 26:12.821
I don't know how to explain how I feel.

26:14.197 --> 26:16.199
But I do know...

26:17.742 --> 26:18.952
it's time to move on.

26:19.035 --> 26:20.035
Agreed.

26:20.537 --> 26:21.746
I'm leaving Freeridge.

26:23.123 --> 26:25.041
I'm starting boarding school
at the end of summer.

26:25.125 --> 26:26.418
Wait. What? Are you serious?

26:26.501 --> 26:28.211
- Not talking to you.
- But you forgave me.

26:28.295 --> 26:29.421
I changed my mind.

26:29.504 --> 26:31.381
Anyway, I finally realized
that it doesn't matter

26:31.464 --> 26:34.509
if any of you are on Team Monse
because I'm on Team Monse.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.428
And that's all I need. So...

26:36.511 --> 26:37.511
I'm out.

26:39.800 --> 26:40.990
Okay.

26:41.308 --> 26:42.392
Good luck.

26:43.226 --> 26:45.145
- Okay? Good luck?
- Yeah.

26:45.478 --> 26:48.273
- You've left before.
- Riding camp. Brentwood.

26:48.356 --> 26:50.609
This is schmuck bait.
You always come back.

26:50.942 --> 26:52.027
Not this time.

26:52.944 --> 26:55.447
I'm gone for good. Things just
aren't the same around here.

26:55.530 --> 26:57.240
And I think we've outgrown each other.

27:00.201 --> 27:01.494
Ruby, what kind of
snacks you got at home?

27:01.578 --> 27:03.371
Did your mom get that
spinach dip from Costco?

27:03.455 --> 27:06.041
No, better. She got the
Jalapeno Artichoke.

27:06.124 --> 27:08.710
Oh, that extra creamy one that you
gotta use the thick chips for?

27:08.793 --> 27:10.378
Oh, she picked those up, too!

27:10.462 --> 27:11.963
- Oh!
- I'm serious!

27:12.047 --> 27:13.840
So are we. That dip's bomb.

27:13.923 --> 27:15.300
Are you even listening to me?

27:15.383 --> 27:18.011
I'm really out of here. I'm done
with the gangs and the bullshit

27:18.094 --> 27:20.138
and the non-stop drama that
you always get me into.

27:20.221 --> 27:21.598
Uh...

27:21.681 --> 27:23.808
We get you into?

27:23.892 --> 27:25.477
Uh... Yeah, you.

27:25.560 --> 27:27.520
- Goodbye.
- Uh... No, no, no, no.

27:27.604 --> 27:29.356
You should not say goodbye.

27:29.439 --> 27:31.100
'Cause I want to. Buh-bye!

27:31.107 --> 27:32.390
- Asshole.
- Hey, hey.

27:32.391 --> 27:34.240
Let's just all take a breath.

27:34.260 --> 27:36.820
Shut up, no one is talking to you.

27:36.905 --> 27:38.657
Okay. We'll see you when you get back.

27:38.740 --> 27:40.742
Yeah, good luck trying
to survive on your own.

27:40.825 --> 27:43.265
Without me, you guys are done.
There'll be no one to save you.

27:43.600 --> 27:44.630
Wow!

27:44.663 --> 27:46.456
Solid performance.

27:46.539 --> 27:48.291
I almost believed it that time.

27:48.470 --> 27:49.584
And yet...

27:49.668 --> 27:50.752
I didn't...

27:50.835 --> 27:54.172
because we all know
that we don't need you.

27:54.255 --> 27:55.507
You need us.

27:56.257 --> 27:57.842
I hope I never see any of you again.

27:58.385 --> 27:59.469
Mm.

28:00.929 --> 28:02.138
That felt pretty real.

28:03.223 --> 28:04.349
Not really.

28:04.432 --> 28:06.893
I didn't see the commitment in her eyes.

28:09.104 --> 28:11.314
- Uh-oh. Is she coming over here?
- Uh-oh.

28:11.398 --> 28:12.899
- She back.
- She's coming back.

28:12.982 --> 28:14.150
She's incoming.

28:15.485 --> 28:17.529
How about now? Eat shit?

28:19.114 --> 28:20.907
- Assholes. All of them.
- Oh, wow.

28:21.574 --> 28:23.785
I'll show them. I need them? Please.

28:23.868 --> 28:25.161
I'd love to see their faces.

28:25.245 --> 28:27.789
The three of them watching
me walk away knowing I won.

28:28.790 --> 28:31.167
But I can't. It's a pussy
move to turn around.

28:31.751 --> 28:34.170
And I don't really wanna
see their stupid faces.

28:34.713 --> 28:35.922
You know what?

28:36.005 --> 28:37.090
No, I do.

28:37.173 --> 28:39.926
I do wanna see their stupid faces.
I wanna see their... No.

28:40.009 --> 28:41.970
No. I don't wanna see
their stupid faces.

28:42.053 --> 28:43.388
Just ten more steps.

28:43.471 --> 28:45.849
It's way more bad-ass
once you set off a bomb,

28:45.932 --> 28:47.058
that you just walk away.

28:47.142 --> 28:49.936
You don't wait for it to explode.
It just explodes behind you.

28:50.019 --> 28:52.814
Oh, screw it! Pussies run the world!

28:55.984 --> 28:57.026
What the hell?

28:58.670 --> 28:59.720
Dicks.
