00:00.350 --> 00:01.350
Who the devil do you think you are?!

00:01.400 --> 00:03.510
~ I am Strange.
~ Indeed.

00:03.560 --> 00:05.030
Artillery!

00:08.240 --> 00:09.710
Lady Pole is there.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.590
~ Mm-hmm.
~ She doesn't see.

00:11.640 --> 00:14.190
Why in the world would
you be sad for her?

00:14.240 --> 00:17.230
'Because she is... beset
by such horrors.'

00:17.280 --> 00:20.220
Lady Pole? Madam, please,
will you help me?

00:24.840 --> 00:26.310
I am home.

00:27.640 --> 00:29.630
I beg you... I beg you
to stop trying to persuade

00:29.680 --> 00:32.189
Mr Strange or anyone else to
understand your predicament.

00:32.240 --> 00:33.230
Argh!

00:33.280 --> 00:35.150
She was not mad before the magic.

00:35.200 --> 00:37.070
She was dead, madam.

00:37.920 --> 00:40.360
Madam! Madam!

00:52.840 --> 00:55.470
Let me go! Let me go!

00:55.520 --> 00:58.230
Norrell! Norrell!

00:58.280 --> 00:59.710
I'll have her hanged!

00:59.760 --> 01:02.030
~ I shall have you hanged!
~ No!

01:14.440 --> 01:16.720
Let me go! No! No!

01:18.640 --> 01:19.920
Quick.

01:21.280 --> 01:22.420
No!

01:36.600 --> 01:37.990
No!

01:38.040 --> 01:39.350
Oh, no!

01:39.400 --> 01:41.190
Never have I been done
such grave injury!

01:41.240 --> 01:42.670
What will this do to English magic?

01:42.720 --> 01:45.720
~ I...
~ My reputation has been ruined
and my servant has been shot, sir!

01:47.840 --> 01:49.670
Allow me to take her away. Please.

01:49.720 --> 01:51.590
Everyone will ask why she did this!

01:51.640 --> 01:53.590
But nobody knows who shot at you.

01:53.640 --> 01:56.430
We may put it about that
it was a French spy.

01:56.480 --> 01:59.030
Lady Pole may be put in an asylum.

01:59.080 --> 02:02.710
The whole business
will be put behind us.

02:02.760 --> 02:05.560
No breath of scandal
will attach to you.

02:07.080 --> 02:08.440
Sir.

02:12.400 --> 02:13.920
No!

03:23.080 --> 03:26.950
All magicians lie. That
one more than most.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.480
Oh, yes.

03:37.200 --> 03:40.070
Why were you performing
Belasis's Scopus?

03:43.280 --> 03:45.280
How long have I slept?

03:45.800 --> 03:48.230
And where did you learn such a thing?

03:48.280 --> 03:51.230
How can I do my work when I'm
constantly betrayed in this manner?

03:51.280 --> 03:53.590
You taught me yourself...

03:53.640 --> 03:56.870
in case I should come across anyone
who said they were a magician.

03:56.920 --> 03:59.710
~ You were afraid...
~ That does not explain
why you were performing it

03:59.760 --> 04:02.360
~ in the square.
~ Because there was...

04:03.000 --> 04:05.200
There was magic everywhere.

04:05.840 --> 04:07.870
No.

04:07.920 --> 04:09.630
Who was that woman?

04:09.680 --> 04:11.670
~ Which woman?
~ The one who shot me.

04:11.720 --> 04:16.350
~ That was Sir Walter Pole's wife.
~ What? No. No, she was a magician.

04:16.399 --> 04:18.070
There was power.

04:18.120 --> 04:19.750
What was that magic?

04:19.800 --> 04:20.950
It was mine.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.310
It was the magic I did to bring
her back from the dead.

04:23.360 --> 04:26.310
That was not your kind of magic.

04:26.360 --> 04:28.350
Who else's should it be?

04:28.400 --> 04:30.590
I confess there may have
been some irregularities

04:30.640 --> 04:32.790
that have caused her
to take an odd turn.

04:32.840 --> 04:35.760
An odd turn?

04:42.000 --> 04:43.630
Perhaps you were drunk.

04:43.680 --> 04:47.400
Have you ever known me to be drunk
in the performance of my duties?

04:49.200 --> 04:51.550
Mr Norrell,

04:51.600 --> 04:54.270
that place just breathed magic

04:54.320 --> 04:57.310
and she was at the heart of it.

04:57.360 --> 05:00.110
~ Where was it?
~ There was no place.

05:00.160 --> 05:01.510
Depend upon it.

05:01.560 --> 05:03.630
There was no such place.

05:04.680 --> 05:08.440
The matter is closed, Childermass.
It is the last I will hear of it.

05:13.440 --> 05:15.150
What happened to her?

05:15.200 --> 05:17.590
She returned with Sir Walter.

05:17.640 --> 05:21.550
We agreed... to say nothing further.

05:21.600 --> 05:23.870
He wishes to send her to Bedlam,

05:23.920 --> 05:25.830
but Bedlam is a little...

05:25.880 --> 05:29.190
People may pay half a crown to
go to look at the lunatics there.

05:29.240 --> 05:31.310
People will go to stare...

05:31.360 --> 05:32.990
and people will wonder.

05:33.040 --> 05:34.590
Horror.

05:34.640 --> 05:37.710
I've been in the most desperate need
of you, but you've been useless.

05:37.760 --> 05:39.960
You've been asleep for days.

05:41.520 --> 05:42.990
Forgive me.

05:47.400 --> 05:49.750
I am awake now.

05:49.800 --> 05:52.840
You may allow me to take
care of Lady Pole.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.870
I'll make certain of her.

05:57.600 --> 06:00.790
And what about your brown jacket?
That's very sober-looking.

06:00.840 --> 06:04.760
~ I've been getting myself
dressed since I was...
~ Yes, yes, yes - but you're married now.

06:07.440 --> 06:09.590
This really is a bothersome thing.

06:09.640 --> 06:12.870
It's a splendid thing!
I'm very proud of you.

06:12.920 --> 06:14.720
Look, let me help.

06:19.200 --> 06:21.270
I hope you do not find
home dull, Jonathan.

06:21.320 --> 06:24.150
The gentleman at Sir Walter's house
said that once you'd tasted war,

06:24.200 --> 06:26.590
~ you were sure to be bored at home.
~ Bored?
~ Mm.

06:26.640 --> 06:30.670
How could one be bored? With
everything clean and just so.

06:30.720 --> 06:33.230
And all one's books so close to hand.

06:33.280 --> 06:37.550
And one's wife, just
there whenever one...

06:37.600 --> 06:39.350
Thank you, Mary.

06:39.400 --> 06:42.230
Besides, one can hardly
be bored with people

06:42.280 --> 06:45.280
shooting at magicians
every hour of the day.

06:48.360 --> 06:51.030
~ Hope they catch the French swine.
~ Mm.

06:53.920 --> 06:56.390
Do you have to go back to Norrell?

06:57.640 --> 07:00.430
I'm in the middle of
my apprenticeship, Bell.

07:00.480 --> 07:02.630
I need Norrell.

07:02.680 --> 07:07.430
I need to study with him and address
certain questions, which I...

07:07.480 --> 07:10.110
require an answer to.

07:10.160 --> 07:11.630
That is all.

07:11.680 --> 07:13.630
I need be no more close
to him than that.

07:13.680 --> 07:17.390
Besides, I was in the Peninsula.

07:17.440 --> 07:20.040
~ I think I can look after myself.
~ Mm.

07:23.840 --> 07:25.710
Hm...

07:25.760 --> 07:28.550
You're very handsome, Mr Strange.

07:28.600 --> 07:30.670
Although your hair does
have more grey in it

07:30.720 --> 07:32.920
than it did before the war.

07:35.240 --> 07:38.240
I think you are very
beautiful, Mrs Strange.

08:00.960 --> 08:02.390
I'm terribly sorry. Er, my...

08:02.440 --> 08:06.190
carriage was caught behind a
man driving cows in Eton Wick.

08:06.240 --> 08:09.510
As I said, I fail to see
what good we are to do.

08:09.560 --> 08:11.700
Magic cannot cure madness.

08:12.600 --> 08:14.630
Well, it does no harm to try.

08:14.680 --> 08:18.070
At the very least, the Prince
will give us his Royal Warrant.

08:18.120 --> 08:21.310
Then we may say we do magic
by Royal Appointment...

08:21.360 --> 08:23.630
and that is very respectable.

08:36.960 --> 08:39.120
(His Majesty, the King.)

08:53.680 --> 08:55.350
I am Gilbert...

08:56.880 --> 09:00.550
I am Gilbert Norrell, Your Majesty,

09:00.600 --> 09:02.790
of Hurtfew Abbey, Yorkshire -

09:02.840 --> 09:07.160
the restorer of English magic and
the greatest magician of the age.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.110
And... And I'm Your Majesty's
servant, Jonathan Strange,

09:12.160 --> 09:14.150
of Ashfair in Shropshire.

09:14.200 --> 09:17.310
Magician-in-Ordinary to the
army during the late war.

09:17.360 --> 09:19.590
It is the hope of Your
Majesty's children

09:19.640 --> 09:23.140
that our magic may afford
you some relief from your...

09:24.360 --> 09:25.880
.. illness.

09:31.400 --> 09:32.710
Ah...

09:32.760 --> 09:35.590
thank you. I seem to be
very clumsy this morning.

09:35.640 --> 09:37.110
Yes, ma'am.

09:38.680 --> 09:41.670
Do you know a lady called Miss Grey?

09:41.720 --> 09:44.030
No, ma'am.

09:44.080 --> 09:47.310
Mr Strange has never mentioned
a Miss Grey to you?

09:47.360 --> 09:48.830
No, ma'am.

09:52.080 --> 09:56.030
You've been walking out with Davey,
have you not? Mr Norrell's man?

09:56.080 --> 09:57.550
Oh...

09:57.600 --> 09:59.950
I... I do not mean to pry.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.870
He is very dashing.

10:02.720 --> 10:05.590
He has such a thick Yorkshire
voice, you can picture him

10:05.640 --> 10:08.070
going about the moors in
a most romantic fashion.

10:08.120 --> 10:10.310
~ Has he mentioned the shooting?
~ Oh.

10:10.360 --> 10:12.960
Only that it was a French spy.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.910
Do people know who it really was?

10:17.960 --> 10:21.470
Davey has not put it about.
He knew it was a secret.

10:21.520 --> 10:24.630
It is that Mr Drawlight
who, begging your pardon,

10:24.680 --> 10:26.880
cannot keep a still tongue.

10:28.800 --> 10:31.320
She is to be put away somewhere.

10:32.920 --> 10:34.920
They do not know where.

10:35.920 --> 10:37.660
Thank you, Mary.

10:40.840 --> 10:44.670
I hate to say it, Mr Strange, but
it was exactly as I had imagined.

10:44.720 --> 10:46.590
There are still so
many misconceptions

10:46.640 --> 10:49.390
about the kinds of magic that we do.

10:49.440 --> 10:51.910
Only the other day, I heard
Lord Castlereagh remark

10:51.960 --> 10:53.910
that you had, at
Wellington's insistence,

10:53.960 --> 10:55.790
employed black magic in Spain.

10:55.840 --> 10:57.310
Why, I corrected him of course.

10:57.360 --> 11:00.880
I told him that we only do "modern
magic for the modern age".

11:03.080 --> 11:04.550
Mr Strange?

11:06.720 --> 11:11.310
I've seen statues of him in the
North and engravings in books.

11:11.360 --> 11:13.510
I never saw a painting before.

11:13.560 --> 11:14.790
Hm?

11:14.840 --> 11:16.510
The Raven King.

11:18.400 --> 11:21.030
That gentleman there
with the silvery hair -

11:21.080 --> 11:23.790
that would seem to be one
of his fairy servants.

11:23.840 --> 11:25.120
Yes.

11:26.240 --> 11:28.470
Yes, and there is a unicorn
and a manticore

11:28.520 --> 11:31.430
and other similarly
ridiculous creatures.

11:31.480 --> 11:34.390
This is a picture of everything
that has disgraced

11:34.440 --> 11:37.740
and crippled English magic
for the last 300 years.

12:02.360 --> 12:04.560
What magic did you attempt?

12:06.640 --> 12:09.230
All of Norrell's old favourites.

12:09.280 --> 12:11.080
They did not work.

12:12.520 --> 12:14.790
I do not consider that he
much wanted them to work.

12:14.840 --> 12:16.680
Hm.

12:19.240 --> 12:22.390
I was at Lady Westby's
house yesterday afternoon.

12:22.440 --> 12:24.950
I met a young lady there who
seems to be under the impression

12:25.000 --> 12:26.430
that you're teaching her.

12:26.480 --> 12:29.310
Stylish girl. Not handsome,
but... very rich.

12:29.360 --> 12:32.100
~ Really?
~ And apparently wild for magic.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.830
Miss Grey.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.880
She has a room decorated
with your pictures.

12:41.200 --> 12:43.870
She told me that she's paid
you 400 guineas to be your...

12:43.920 --> 12:45.660
To be your pupil.

12:46.320 --> 12:47.660
Well...

12:48.840 --> 12:51.230
.. I think I might
forget a young lady,

12:51.280 --> 12:53.830
but I do not think I could
forget 400 guineas.

12:53.880 --> 12:56.430
Then why has she said it?

12:56.480 --> 12:58.830
To make me jealous? I...

12:58.880 --> 13:01.190
What am I to say to her?

13:01.240 --> 13:03.910
Tell her I did not receive
the 400 guineas.

13:03.960 --> 13:07.150
Bell, you know I do not take pupils.

13:07.200 --> 13:09.270
Norrell would have a
blue fit, for one thing.

13:09.320 --> 13:13.070
I do not understand. I do not
understand why people must...

13:13.120 --> 13:15.310
One does one's best, and
then, all of a sudden,

13:15.360 --> 13:17.560
you're in the middle of a...

13:20.400 --> 13:22.670
Do you know who shot Norrell?

13:24.760 --> 13:27.510
~ Yes.
~ Well, then, let us not
pretend about it any more.

13:27.560 --> 13:31.750
I hope you do not make yourself
uneasy about Lady Pole.

13:31.800 --> 13:33.830
Please do not give
yourself any blame.

13:33.880 --> 13:36.270
I feel I was stupid, Jonathan.

13:36.320 --> 13:40.240
I'm not even entirely sure that I
considered that she was in fact mad.

13:42.080 --> 13:44.350
Will you go back to the King?

13:46.360 --> 13:48.100
Norrell will not.

13:49.160 --> 13:51.230
Perhaps I might go back.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.990
Perhaps I might find a
path where Norrell cannot.

13:55.040 --> 13:59.830
Please do not do it because you think you might
be able to find a way to help my friend.

13:59.880 --> 14:02.750
Very kind of you, but
please do not do it.

14:03.120 --> 14:06.230
~ Well...
~ I'm finished with it, Jonathan.

14:06.280 --> 14:08.680
It's too painful to think about.

14:42.400 --> 14:43.470
'Of course, Mr Strange,'

14:43.520 --> 14:44.950
my book naturally gravitates

14:45.000 --> 14:46.990
towards Mr Norrell's
many achievements.

14:47.040 --> 14:51.030
Chapter two concerns the
wonderful events at York,

14:51.080 --> 14:52.350
the talking statues...

14:52.400 --> 14:54.190
It is a good opportunity
to dispel forever

14:54.240 --> 14:57.110
the rumour that I use
magic to do laundry.

14:57.800 --> 15:00.470
It is a very fine book, Henry.

15:00.520 --> 15:02.860
Lord, I've enjoyed reading it.

15:03.960 --> 15:07.120
Forgive me, gentlemen,
I have an... appointment.

15:09.360 --> 15:12.630
Then, of course, the
rain ships at Brest,

15:12.680 --> 15:14.230
the sea-beacons...

15:14.280 --> 15:16.830
~ Oh, are they finished?
~ For the purposes of the book.

15:16.880 --> 15:18.310
There are then 15 chapters

15:18.360 --> 15:21.030
dealing with the pernicious nature
of the magic of the past.

15:21.080 --> 15:24.030
The remaining two detail
our hopes and suggestions

15:24.080 --> 15:26.680
for what modern magic might achieve.

15:27.680 --> 15:29.590
Oh, erm, Mr Murray has
given me a few more days

15:29.640 --> 15:31.030
to come up with a final chapter

15:31.080 --> 15:33.950
on Mr Norrell's greatest and
most prestigious challenge -

15:34.000 --> 15:35.550
his attendance on the King.

15:35.600 --> 15:36.950
Shame it did not work.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.590
We may turn that to our advantage.

15:38.640 --> 15:42.190
Mr Norrell has long held the view
that magic cannot cure madness.

15:42.240 --> 15:44.670
Will you mention Lady
Pole in this context?

15:44.720 --> 15:47.350
~ No.
~ We think it important to
present your trip to Windsor

15:47.400 --> 15:51.510
as a heroic and patriotic attempt to
do magic that simply cannot be done.

15:51.560 --> 15:55.310
Well, we did not attempt
absolutely everything.

15:55.360 --> 15:58.110
We attempted every functioning
spell that might be applicable.

15:58.160 --> 16:00.150
Well, perhaps there might
be spells which...

16:00.200 --> 16:01.790
have fallen into disrepute,

16:01.840 --> 16:03.950
or have been misreported...

16:04.000 --> 16:05.870
I do not understand what you mean.

16:05.920 --> 16:08.550
I think what Mr Strange
is trying to say is that,

16:08.600 --> 16:11.310
considering the myths and
superstitions which have grown up

16:11.360 --> 16:12.990
over the last 300 years,

16:13.040 --> 16:16.910
it is near impossible to
extract any meaningful magic

16:16.960 --> 16:18.910
from the way that things
used to be done at all.

16:18.960 --> 16:20.310
Ah.

16:20.360 --> 16:24.280
That is what you meant to
say, is it not, Mr Strange?

16:26.640 --> 16:28.080
Yes.

16:36.840 --> 16:40.390
Well, Your Majesty,

16:40.440 --> 16:42.430
this has been a great pleasure.

16:42.480 --> 16:44.680
Perhaps my tutor was right.

17:24.280 --> 17:26.920
Worth a try, eh?

17:31.320 --> 17:33.630
I do not see you, magician,

17:33.680 --> 17:37.590
but I see your companion
very clearly.

17:37.640 --> 17:40.550
With such silver hair as he has,

17:40.600 --> 17:43.470
I ought to be able
to see him very well.

17:43.520 --> 17:45.960
~ Your Majesty?
~ A king, say you?

17:47.320 --> 17:50.230
Well, that's all very well,
but I am bound to observe

17:50.280 --> 17:52.910
that I have never heard
of any of your kingdoms.

17:52.960 --> 17:54.990
Lost-Hope?

17:55.040 --> 17:56.910
Where is Lost-Hope?

17:57.680 --> 18:00.790
The City of the Iron
Angels? Where is that?

18:00.840 --> 18:04.110
I am King of Great Britain, sir,

18:04.160 --> 18:09.440
a place everybody knows and is
clearly marked on all the maps.

18:10.880 --> 18:12.430
Sir?

18:12.480 --> 18:14.220
Do not be angry.

18:15.440 --> 18:17.430
I am a king, you are a king.

18:17.480 --> 18:19.910
Let's all be kings together.

18:19.960 --> 18:23.390
~ Your Majesty, can you hear me?
~ I would dearly like that.

18:23.440 --> 18:26.430
The last time I was permitted
out of these rooms

18:26.480 --> 18:29.990
was on a Monday in 1810.

18:30.040 --> 18:33.160
946 years ago.

18:40.160 --> 18:41.880
Your Majesty?

18:56.000 --> 18:57.560
Whoa! Whoa!

18:58.720 --> 19:00.320
Whoa, whoa.

19:08.840 --> 19:11.040
May I be of assistance, sir?

19:18.440 --> 19:19.960
Sir?

19:36.040 --> 19:37.840
Sir! Sir!

19:40.160 --> 19:42.670
Let this music be the envoy
sent to summon the King.

19:42.720 --> 19:45.830
Let this slipper be the handsel
the King shall receive.

19:45.880 --> 19:47.870
And let the moment
of this flame's death

19:47.920 --> 19:49.830
be the moment the King shall appear!

19:49.880 --> 19:51.520
No! No! No!

19:52.560 --> 19:53.800
No!

20:18.520 --> 20:21.260
I believe this is
yours, Your Majesty.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.920
This act will have
consequences, magician.

20:30.520 --> 20:32.520
Where did you go, sir?

20:40.840 --> 20:43.670
A most serious matter
has arisen, Stephen.

20:43.720 --> 20:47.550
All our wonderful plans have
been rudely overturned,

20:47.600 --> 20:51.110
and once again it is the stupid
magician who thwarts us.

20:51.160 --> 20:53.070
Who was that old gentleman, sir?

20:53.120 --> 20:55.150
Why, the King of England, of course.

20:55.200 --> 20:58.390
I had brought him here so that
you might fulfil your destiny,

20:58.440 --> 21:02.030
by cutting off his head
and taking his place.

21:02.080 --> 21:04.270
But the King has 13 children, sir.

21:04.320 --> 21:06.470
The crown would be passed
on to one of them

21:06.520 --> 21:08.030
and certainly not to a man such as I.

21:08.080 --> 21:12.310
No, the King's children
are all fat and stupid.

21:12.360 --> 21:14.710
Who would wish to be governed
by such frights,

21:14.760 --> 21:17.350
when they might instead be
governed by you, Stephen,

21:17.400 --> 21:21.200
whose noble countenance would
look so well upon a coin?

21:22.600 --> 21:24.510
But what should we do?

21:24.560 --> 21:25.910
About what, sir?

21:25.960 --> 21:29.230
The magician, Stephen.
He is our enemy.

21:29.280 --> 21:32.110
We must destroy him utterly

21:32.160 --> 21:33.960
and take his wife.

21:35.400 --> 21:37.470
Oh, Stephen.

21:37.520 --> 21:39.470
You are brilliant.

21:39.520 --> 21:43.390
Of course, it will
be very hard to find,

21:43.440 --> 21:45.470
but it will destroy him utterly.

21:45.520 --> 21:47.190
What will, sir?

21:48.800 --> 21:50.790
Moss-oak.

21:50.840 --> 21:54.190
We must find and awaken a moss-oak.

21:54.240 --> 21:58.160
If we use it well, the magician
will bargain her life away.

21:59.360 --> 22:02.230
And the beauty of it is, Stephen,

22:02.280 --> 22:05.220
he will have no notion
that he has done so.

22:07.840 --> 22:09.230
Sir!

22:20.280 --> 22:22.150
Why are there no spells
to cure madness, sir?

22:22.200 --> 22:24.710
~ Because the Aureates did...
Where have you been?
~ Windsor.

22:24.760 --> 22:27.830
~ What?!
~ I'm sure I read once that fairies
have a strong interest in madmen.

22:27.880 --> 22:30.270
Is that true? Is it not in
Chaston? Where is Chaston?

22:30.320 --> 22:31.910
It's on the north-westerly bookcase.

22:31.960 --> 22:33.670
What occurred there, Mr Strange?

22:33.720 --> 22:35.470
Windsor, Mr Strange?

22:35.520 --> 22:37.150
Yes...

22:37.200 --> 22:38.550
Is it your belief, Mr Norrell,

22:38.600 --> 22:40.470
that fairies have left
England completely?

22:40.520 --> 22:41.830
And what of mirrors?

22:41.880 --> 22:43.990
I remember a reference
in Ormskirk to a kingdom

22:44.040 --> 22:46.790
that lies behind reflective surfaces,
full of the most remark...

22:46.840 --> 22:48.590
What is all this talk?

22:48.640 --> 22:50.910
I'm sorry, but when
I was with the King...

22:50.960 --> 22:52.910
It was agreed we could
do nothing for the King.

22:52.960 --> 22:55.550
Yes, but you see, a very odd thing
happened with His Majesty...

22:55.600 --> 22:59.630
Well, if you persist in doing magic
without reference to me, Mr Strange,
odd things will happen.

22:59.680 --> 23:01.590
We must keep to our agreed plan.

23:01.640 --> 23:03.310
We must stand together upon it.

23:03.360 --> 23:06.520
It is more important now than
ever it was. Is that clear?

23:08.400 --> 23:10.470
May I speak frankly, sir?

23:13.360 --> 23:15.510
You've heard whispers
of it, I'm sure.

23:15.560 --> 23:19.750
But when I was in the Peninsula,
after the loss of your books -

23:19.800 --> 23:21.750
for which I am very sorry -

23:21.800 --> 23:23.950
I performed magic which...

23:24.000 --> 23:26.870
you might not have
considered respectable.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.940
Magic of older times.

23:31.120 --> 23:34.710
I'm not proud of it, sir,
but often, sir, it worked.

23:34.760 --> 23:37.310
It may have worked in an
imperfect sort of way.

23:37.360 --> 23:39.590
Perhaps because you
were not in England...

23:39.640 --> 23:40.710
No, no, no, no.

23:40.760 --> 23:43.990
This was a different sort of magic
to anything we have done up to now.

23:44.040 --> 23:47.110
~ It felt different...
~ Things are done in times of war -

23:47.160 --> 23:49.230
or for the furtherance
of noble causes -

23:49.280 --> 23:52.580
which might be most regrettable
in times of peace.

23:53.360 --> 23:55.350
I do not say you should be ashamed.

23:55.400 --> 23:57.670
~ I do not say that.
~ You have always said that that magic -

23:57.720 --> 23:59.950
~ the old magic - was no longer possible.
~ It is not.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.350
But of course, there may be
remnants here and there...

24:02.400 --> 24:04.350
I do not think these things
were remnants, sir.

24:04.400 --> 24:07.870
Mr Strange, I have been studying
magic for 40 years.

24:07.920 --> 24:10.310
We dare not meddle with such things.

24:10.360 --> 24:12.230
They are only half-understood.

24:12.280 --> 24:15.640
But surely it is precisely BECAUSE it
is only half-understood that we MUST!

24:18.000 --> 24:20.390
If there exists a magic beyond
the magic that we do...

24:20.440 --> 24:22.110
Then we let it alone.

24:22.160 --> 24:24.350
We must say that modern
magic is the only way,

24:24.400 --> 24:27.470
or we will end up beggars
in yellow-curtained tents!

24:27.520 --> 24:29.470
This other magic,
it will not do, sir.

24:29.520 --> 24:31.400
It will not do.

24:33.800 --> 24:36.430
Have you read the proof
of Mr Lascelles' book yet?

24:36.480 --> 24:38.020
No, not yet.

24:39.400 --> 24:41.400
It is a very fine book.

24:42.800 --> 24:46.920
It is my hope that it will establish
Norrellite magic for the modern age.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.800
Do you understand?

24:51.440 --> 24:53.240
Yes, I believe do.

24:57.160 --> 24:58.560
Whoa!

25:06.840 --> 25:08.790
You are the madhouse-keepers?

25:08.840 --> 25:10.910
I have a letter for you.

25:17.800 --> 25:21.910
Ah, Lady Pole. My name
is John Segundus.

25:21.960 --> 25:25.750
This is my friend and
colleague Mr Honeyfoot.

25:25.800 --> 25:28.040
Welcome to Starecross.

25:31.600 --> 25:33.040
Madam.

25:43.560 --> 25:45.990
For your own good, madam.

25:46.040 --> 25:49.630
So, you are the lady whom Mr Norrell
brought back from the dead?

25:51.320 --> 25:53.750
Have you been
madhouse-keepers for long?

25:53.800 --> 25:57.470
No. Her Ladyship will
be our first... patient.

25:57.520 --> 25:59.030
But you are doctors?

25:59.080 --> 26:02.390
Not in the... fullest
sense of the word.

26:02.440 --> 26:03.910
Uh!

26:03.960 --> 26:05.310
I beg your pardon.

26:05.360 --> 26:06.640
Oh...

26:07.800 --> 26:09.340
There we go.

26:12.640 --> 26:14.920
Your new lodgings, madam.

26:19.600 --> 26:20.910
So what are you, then?

26:20.960 --> 26:23.430
~ Well, um...
~ You are magicians.
~ I'm not.

26:23.480 --> 26:24.830
Stephen, turn me back to London.

26:24.880 --> 26:26.350
No, my Lady, no.

26:26.400 --> 26:28.470
You are Norrell's men.
I am sold once more.

26:28.520 --> 26:30.590
~ Stephen!
~ We are no friends to Mr Norrell.

26:30.640 --> 26:33.390
Believe me when I say we are
here for your benefit, my lady,

26:33.440 --> 26:35.750
~ and yours alone.
~ Well, then, you will let me go at once,

26:35.800 --> 26:37.910
and not make me stay one
more moment in this place.

26:37.960 --> 26:40.300
Stephen! Stephen, turn me back!

26:41.160 --> 26:44.750
Stephen! No! Stephen, please!

26:44.800 --> 26:46.110
Come back now!

26:46.160 --> 26:47.350
Well...

26:47.400 --> 26:48.430
Stephen!

26:48.480 --> 26:50.350
That went very well.

26:51.400 --> 26:53.000
Stephen!

26:57.840 --> 26:59.480
Stephen!

27:11.120 --> 27:13.590
Lascelles does not do you justice.

27:15.200 --> 27:16.630
That's hardly a surprise.

27:16.680 --> 27:18.750
I think it is most
inconvenient to him

27:18.800 --> 27:20.270
that I did not die in the Peninsula.

27:20.320 --> 27:23.070
Well, there's no mention at all of
the magic that you did in the war.

27:23.120 --> 27:26.790
Everything Norrell's ever done is
puffed up to ridiculous proportions.

27:26.840 --> 27:29.390
And the way that he tells
about Lady Pole...

27:29.440 --> 27:30.830
If you have any sense,

27:30.880 --> 27:32.830
you'll refuse to attach
your name to it.

27:32.880 --> 27:35.070
He'll only write another book.

27:35.120 --> 27:36.990
It does not matter.

27:38.840 --> 27:41.710
I do not concern myself
with such things.

27:42.240 --> 27:44.510
I am a magician. That is all.

27:45.400 --> 27:47.670
You're the King's magician.

27:47.720 --> 27:50.190
The Duke of Wellington's magician.

27:51.880 --> 27:53.870
I am your magician, Bell.

27:53.920 --> 27:56.270
And my own.

27:56.320 --> 27:58.870
Anything beyond that is distraction.

27:58.920 --> 28:00.030
I have things to discover.

28:00.080 --> 28:01.990
Do you remember the first
spell that you did?

28:02.040 --> 28:04.240
Yes, yes, and yes again.

28:05.480 --> 28:07.750
I remember it perfectly well.

28:11.480 --> 28:14.190
What do you expect me to do?

28:14.240 --> 28:17.240
Things are as they
are. I... I'm sorry.

28:21.160 --> 28:22.670
It seems to me we've lost sight

28:22.720 --> 28:26.020
of why we started on this
path in the first place.

28:33.840 --> 28:37.110
They say Napoleon is not finding
exile very much to his liking.

28:37.160 --> 28:40.070
They say he has very little
to do, and very few hobbies.

28:40.120 --> 28:42.710
It is as if Mr Davey and Mr Faraday

28:42.760 --> 28:45.030
and our other great scientists
felt obliged to begin

28:45.080 --> 28:48.200
all their lectures by expressing
their loathing of Isaac Newton.

28:53.680 --> 28:55.030
Eh, you touched your nose.

28:55.080 --> 28:56.830
You're moving the balls
about by magic.

28:56.880 --> 29:00.180
A man may sneeze, Grant,
mayn't he? I have a cold.

29:02.240 --> 29:03.670
Might the table be free?

29:03.720 --> 29:05.030
No, it might not.

29:05.080 --> 29:06.230
How is Lord Wellington?

29:06.280 --> 29:07.670
The Duke, you mean? Concerned.

29:07.720 --> 29:09.430
He's worried that Napoleon
will return.

29:09.480 --> 29:11.670
Why did they not give you
a... baronetcy or something

29:11.720 --> 29:13.070
when they made him Duke?

29:13.120 --> 29:15.070
Lord Liverpool says
they considered it,

29:15.120 --> 29:17.630
but they felt they would have
to give Norrell something, too.

29:17.680 --> 29:22.070
~ And I don't think anyone quite has
the stomach to call him "My Lord".
~ Sirs, you are talking, not playing.

29:22.120 --> 29:24.710
Mr Tantony and I are
from Nottinghamshire.

29:24.760 --> 29:26.350
May we not play while you chat?

29:26.400 --> 29:29.150
To ask a gentleman to break off
his game before it is ended, sir,

29:29.200 --> 29:31.230
is a thing that is never
done at the Bedford.

29:31.280 --> 29:33.350
Ah... I beg your pardon.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.030
(I didn't know...)

29:36.080 --> 29:39.190
Well, then, perhaps you could tell
me whether you think it will be

29:39.240 --> 29:40.990
a short game or a long 'un.

29:41.040 --> 29:42.670
We do not know, sir!

29:42.720 --> 29:45.510
This is Mr Tantony's
first visit to London.

29:45.560 --> 29:47.870
I particularly wished to
show him in the Bedford,

29:47.920 --> 29:50.870
but I did not think to find the
people here so very disobliging.

29:50.920 --> 29:53.830
Well, then, I can only suggest
that you return home to, er...

29:53.880 --> 29:56.390
NOTHING-ham-shire, I
think it was you said?

29:56.440 --> 29:58.110
Are there no pigs to be fed there?

29:58.160 --> 30:01.110
Mr Tantony and I are not farmers.

30:01.160 --> 30:02.310
We are brewers.

30:02.360 --> 30:04.110
We have beer enough, thank you, sir.

30:04.160 --> 30:05.550
We're not here to sell beer!

30:05.600 --> 30:08.590
Mr Tantony is being
instructed in magic

30:08.640 --> 30:10.270
by Mr Strange himself.

30:10.320 --> 30:11.470
What?

30:11.520 --> 30:12.750
Oh, yes.

30:12.800 --> 30:17.110
Mr Strange writes Mr Tantony letters
full of the most remarkable advice.

30:17.160 --> 30:18.350
Such as?

30:18.400 --> 30:19.670
I will not tell you.

30:19.720 --> 30:22.710
You can come to your own
arrangement with Mr Strange.

30:22.760 --> 30:24.310
You pay Mr Strange?

30:24.360 --> 30:26.630
Oh, yes. 70 guineas.

30:26.680 --> 30:28.590
And you have not met him?

30:28.640 --> 30:31.510
No, but we hope to.

30:31.560 --> 30:33.910
We're going to go and stand
outside his house tomorrow.

30:33.960 --> 30:35.590
What advice does he give you?

30:35.640 --> 30:36.870
Uh...

30:36.920 --> 30:38.110
Tell him.

30:38.160 --> 30:39.230
Oh, yes.

30:39.280 --> 30:41.750
Well, the other day, Mr
Tantony asked for a spell

30:41.800 --> 30:44.430
to make it stop raining
in Nottinghamshire.

30:44.480 --> 30:48.150
Mr Strange wrote back to say he
would never employ such magic.

30:48.200 --> 30:50.270
He said - did he not, Mr Tantony? -

30:50.320 --> 30:52.230
that in meddling with
English weather,

30:52.280 --> 30:54.830
we meddled with England,
and in meddling with England

30:54.880 --> 30:59.030
we risked destroying the very
foundations of English magic.

30:59.080 --> 31:00.710
Have you ever said such a thing?

31:00.760 --> 31:02.990
Yes, but not to these gentleman.

31:03.040 --> 31:06.870
Sir, I am Jonathan Strange and I've
never heard of you before today.

31:06.920 --> 31:08.670
You are the victims of a hoax.

31:08.720 --> 31:10.230
Yes, indeed.

31:10.280 --> 31:12.470
You are no more Mr Strange
than my wife is.

31:12.520 --> 31:14.350
Well, it is easily resolved.

31:14.400 --> 31:17.270
There are any number of magical things
my friend could do to prove it.

31:17.320 --> 31:20.030
Oh, yes? And what might they be?

31:20.080 --> 31:22.020
Yes, tell us, Merlin.

31:36.600 --> 31:38.070
Good Lord!

31:38.120 --> 31:39.860
Where did he go?

31:41.440 --> 31:42.640
Er...

32:29.240 --> 32:32.190
~ And how is Mr Strange?
~ Oh, busy, madam.

32:32.240 --> 32:33.590
Busy.

32:33.640 --> 32:37.510
But only yesterday, he inquired
most particularly after you.

32:37.560 --> 32:38.910
I should think so.

32:38.960 --> 32:41.190
I have paid him more
than 100 guineas, sir.

32:41.240 --> 32:42.630
The very last of my money.

32:42.680 --> 32:46.790
Oh, but think of the good it
will do, madam. An investment.

32:46.840 --> 32:48.310
You see...

32:49.840 --> 32:51.630
How thin the walls are.

32:51.680 --> 32:54.550
You see, Jonathan Strange is...

33:00.960 --> 33:03.030
Jonathan Strange is a...

33:08.520 --> 33:10.460
Jonathan Strange...?!

33:12.680 --> 33:13.920
Ah!

33:21.520 --> 33:23.150
I hope you'll be so kind, madam,

33:23.200 --> 33:24.990
as to forgive the lateness
of my visit.

33:25.040 --> 33:30.120
The way was a little more meandering
than I had anticipated.

33:33.680 --> 33:35.680
I am Jonathan Strange.

33:38.480 --> 33:39.910
Mrs Bullworth.

33:39.960 --> 33:41.590
At last.

33:41.640 --> 33:44.590
I have taken the liberty of writing,
by each of their names,

33:44.640 --> 33:47.630
the magical punishment which
I believe ought to be theirs.

33:47.680 --> 33:49.670
But I should be glad
of your recommendations,

33:49.720 --> 33:51.670
since you are to carry them out.

33:51.720 --> 33:53.190
"Mrs Bullworth Senior..."

33:53.240 --> 33:55.790
My mother-in-law.

33:55.840 --> 33:57.870
".. to be drowned in a laundry tub.

33:57.920 --> 34:01.510
"To be choked to death on
her own apricot preserves.

34:01.560 --> 34:04.310
"To be accidentally baked
in a bread oven."

34:04.360 --> 34:07.470
Forgive me, Mrs Bullworth, but even
the greatest magician who ever lived

34:07.520 --> 34:09.870
could not kill the same person
three different ways.

34:09.920 --> 34:11.710
Well, as much as you can manage.

34:11.760 --> 34:14.710
And Mr Bullworth. What
should I do to him?

34:14.760 --> 34:16.830
A disfiguring disease.

34:16.880 --> 34:19.830
Bankruptcy. Lunacy. Fire.

34:19.880 --> 34:22.429
A villain to lie in wait
for him and cut off his...

34:22.480 --> 34:23.989
Mrs Bullworth...

34:24.040 --> 34:26.230
You have been the victim
of a deception.

34:26.280 --> 34:29.310
I have never undertaken commissions
for private individuals.

34:29.360 --> 34:32.230
Not Gatcombe, not Tantony,
not Miss Grey.

34:32.280 --> 34:34.510
I never even heard of
you before tonight...

34:34.560 --> 34:37.030
and I have never employed this...

34:37.639 --> 34:39.280
.. person.

34:44.480 --> 34:46.230
Drawlight!

34:46.280 --> 34:48.350
I am sorry for it, madam.

34:48.800 --> 34:50.429
Drawlight!

34:50.480 --> 34:54.949
We waited several hours for him
to return from the mirror, madam,

34:55.000 --> 34:58.870
but he did not, so we thought
we would come here and see if...

34:58.920 --> 35:02.440
Ah, he's here, Ma'am.
He's quite safe.

35:04.040 --> 35:05.350
Has something happened?

35:05.400 --> 35:07.350
Blockhead.

35:07.400 --> 35:08.990
Where on earth have you been?

35:09.040 --> 35:13.070
Shoreditch. You were not afraid,
were you? I was perfectly all right.

35:13.120 --> 35:14.800
I always am.

35:16.200 --> 35:18.350
Well, tell us, where
did you disappear to?

35:18.400 --> 35:19.990
I do not have words to describe it.

35:20.040 --> 35:22.190
It... It is another land entirely.

35:22.240 --> 35:25.030
Everything Norrell and
I have done is as nothing.

35:25.080 --> 35:27.630
It is the most amazing
place I have ever seen.

35:27.680 --> 35:29.150
Shoreditch?

35:29.200 --> 35:31.670
Do not be flippant. Shoreditch
is where Drawlight was.

35:31.720 --> 35:34.270
~ You have been with Drawlight?
~ Yes, he's been arranging for me

35:34.320 --> 35:37.470
~ to do every sort of black
magic one can think of.
~ Why?

35:37.520 --> 35:40.190
Hm. Money, I presume. He
ran away, which is a pity,

35:40.240 --> 35:42.670
as I had a great mind to
challenge him to a duel.

35:42.720 --> 35:45.910
~ Oh, it's duels now, is it?
~ But what happened behind the mirror?

35:45.960 --> 35:48.270
I discovered... the King's Roads.

35:48.320 --> 35:52.030
The ancient paths between this
land and the other realms.

35:52.080 --> 35:54.150
They have been closed
for hundreds of years,

35:54.200 --> 35:57.110
but now... they are open again.

35:57.160 --> 35:58.750
That was where I went.

35:58.800 --> 36:00.710
That does not sound
very safe, Jonathan.

36:00.760 --> 36:02.470
Safe? Oh, no, I do not think so.

36:02.520 --> 36:05.470
But then I flatter myself that
I am not particularly safe.

36:05.520 --> 36:07.870
~ And when I return...
~ Oh, return?!

36:07.920 --> 36:09.950
So, you will be losing
yourself in this place

36:10.000 --> 36:11.710
every moment that Norrell
can spare you,

36:11.760 --> 36:14.190
whilst I remain here in the
most miserable suspense,

36:14.240 --> 36:16.110
wondering if I'm ever
to see you again.

36:16.160 --> 36:18.230
~ Bell, what on earth is the matter?
~ The matter?!

36:18.280 --> 36:20.870
You are set upon putting yourself
in the most horrible danger,

36:20.920 --> 36:22.470
and just expect me to say nothing?

36:22.520 --> 36:24.910
~ I was in the Peninsula...
~ I know you were in the Peninsula.

36:24.960 --> 36:27.310
You never cease to tell me that
you were in the Peninsula.

36:27.360 --> 36:30.230
But having been in the Peninsula,
it's not some sort of magical charm

36:30.280 --> 36:31.630
that grants you immortality.

36:31.680 --> 36:33.990
When I went to war, you
were perfectly composed.

36:34.040 --> 36:36.910
I was nothing of the sort.

36:36.960 --> 36:39.300
I was horribly afraid for you.

36:39.880 --> 36:41.270
But then, you had a duty,

36:41.320 --> 36:43.310
and you had the entire
British Army beside you.

36:43.360 --> 36:45.830
There, you will be entirely
alone! I... I say "there",

36:45.880 --> 36:48.070
but none of us know where
"there" is, do we?

36:48.120 --> 36:49.630
I know exactly where it is.

36:49.680 --> 36:52.470
It is the place Norrell has tried
to keep from me from the beginning.

36:52.520 --> 36:55.790
Really, Bell, it is a little late to
decide you do not like my profession.

36:55.840 --> 36:57.390
It was you who demanded I get one.

36:57.440 --> 36:59.350
Do not you dare say
that to me, Jonathan.

36:59.400 --> 37:01.910
I have never said a word
against your occupation.

37:01.960 --> 37:05.350
Until today, you have always been content
to make your discoveries in books.

37:05.400 --> 37:08.600
Books! I'm not permitted
to read half the books.

37:09.760 --> 37:12.750
Bell, try to understand...

37:12.800 --> 37:15.990
Everything that has happened to
me of late - in the Peninsula,

37:16.040 --> 37:17.630
with the King, this evening -

37:17.680 --> 37:20.750
it has convinced me there is more
magic possible than I ever dreamed.

37:20.800 --> 37:22.710
You have no idea where
these paths lead.

37:22.760 --> 37:25.230
No, and that is the glorious,
wonderful thing of it.

37:25.280 --> 37:28.790
Promise me that you will not
go out on those roads again.

37:28.840 --> 37:30.510
No.

37:30.560 --> 37:32.790
Well, then I withdraw my demand.

37:32.840 --> 37:35.110
I don't want you to have
an occupation, Jonathan.

37:35.160 --> 37:38.320
I'll have you idle. I'll have
you the man that I married!

37:45.120 --> 37:48.120
Damn magic to hell. Damn
where it's led us.

37:56.800 --> 37:59.540
Well, thank you for
a pleasant evening.

38:08.760 --> 38:10.440
Whoa, whoa.

38:14.200 --> 38:17.110
Ah, Henry. So very
good of you to see me.

38:17.160 --> 38:18.750
Ah, erm...

38:18.800 --> 38:20.550
Where... Where is he?

38:20.600 --> 38:23.750
He's at home. I've never
seen him so angry.

38:23.800 --> 38:25.510
Let me talk to him.

38:25.560 --> 38:26.710
Absolutely not.

38:26.760 --> 38:30.030
You are to have no contact with him
until I tell you that you might.

38:30.080 --> 38:33.270
If he knew I was meeting you, he
would have my head on a spike.

38:33.320 --> 38:35.790
Norrell owes everything to me.

38:35.840 --> 38:39.000
Without me, nobody would ever
have heard of him, or you.

38:40.200 --> 38:42.200
There would be no book.

38:43.520 --> 38:46.510
You could not do without me then,
and you cannot do without me now.

38:46.560 --> 38:49.070
On the contrary. It is most
desirable that we do without you.

38:49.120 --> 38:50.750
Damn you!

38:50.800 --> 38:54.190
What convinced you you could succeed
in such a perfectly absurd scheme?

38:54.240 --> 38:56.780
I should call you out here and now.

38:58.320 --> 39:01.110
I'm sorry. The money wasn't...

39:01.160 --> 39:03.630
for me... My...

39:03.680 --> 39:05.960
My... My debts.

39:07.400 --> 39:09.340
Will you please help?

39:10.720 --> 39:13.190
I'm at the limit of my endurance.

39:14.520 --> 39:16.030
Well, we shall see.

39:16.080 --> 39:17.550
Where are you staying?

39:17.600 --> 39:19.390
I'm at The Shakespeare's Head.

39:19.440 --> 39:21.070
Go there and wait.

39:21.120 --> 39:24.310
And if you ever risk my standing
with Norrell again -

39:24.360 --> 39:26.950
listen to me -

39:27.000 --> 39:30.710
I will kill you myself.

39:30.760 --> 39:33.360
Thank you, Henry. Thank you.

39:38.680 --> 39:40.030
On to Mr Norrell's house.

39:40.080 --> 39:42.870
Oh, and, Lucas, take these to the
bailiffs at the King's Bench.

39:42.920 --> 39:44.470
Tell them they're an enumeration

39:44.520 --> 39:46.790
for the outstanding debts
of Christopher Drawlight,

39:46.840 --> 39:48.150
and he may be found and arrested

39:48.200 --> 39:51.400
at The Shakespeare's
Head, Covent Garden.

39:57.360 --> 39:59.950
I've been considering the matter
very carefully - in fact,

40:00.000 --> 40:02.270
I have thought of little else.

40:02.320 --> 40:04.430
We must revive the Cinque Dragownes.

40:04.480 --> 40:05.550
The what?

40:05.600 --> 40:08.830
It is a medieval court established
to punish false magicians.

40:08.880 --> 40:11.190
Thankfully, the medieval
law was never revoked.

40:11.240 --> 40:14.030
But Drawlight is not a magician.
Surely a common-law court...

40:14.080 --> 40:17.390
No. His crimes were
specifically magical crimes.

40:17.440 --> 40:19.710
We require a magical court.

40:19.760 --> 40:21.710
What other security do I have?

40:21.760 --> 40:23.430
When people attack me in the street?

40:23.480 --> 40:25.470
When other magicians
- evil magicians -

40:25.520 --> 40:27.950
might arise to challenge my
authority, to contradict me?

40:28.000 --> 40:29.710
I have to have a court of my own.

40:29.760 --> 40:32.390
Mr Norrell, it is not
the duty of any court

40:32.440 --> 40:35.590
to exalt one person's opinions
above another's.

40:35.640 --> 40:38.350
If other magicians think
differently from you,

40:38.400 --> 40:40.430
you must battle it out with them.

40:40.480 --> 40:43.310
You must argue and publish
and practise your magic,

40:43.360 --> 40:45.070
and you must learn to live as I do,

40:45.120 --> 40:48.110
in the face of constant criticism,
opposition and censure.

40:48.160 --> 40:50.350
That, sir, is the English way.

40:50.400 --> 40:53.150
But the Cinque Dragownes is our
best chance of having him hanged.

40:53.200 --> 40:54.870
Hanged?

40:54.920 --> 40:59.270
Mr Norrell, I feel his
injury as deeply as you,

40:59.320 --> 41:02.350
probably even more so, since
it was directed at me.

41:02.400 --> 41:04.830
But I will not be the cause
of another man's death.

41:04.880 --> 41:08.190
I was in the Penin...
I have been at war, sir.

41:08.240 --> 41:10.110
I have seen enough men die.

41:10.160 --> 41:13.430
In any case, I scarcely think Drawlight
is any more to blame than you.

41:13.480 --> 41:14.950
Why, what have I done?

41:15.000 --> 41:17.310
Well, what possessed you to
go out on the King's Roads?

41:17.360 --> 41:19.830
People will think I approved
of what you did that night.

41:19.880 --> 41:22.110
And why should you not?

41:22.160 --> 41:24.550
It is a momentous discovery, sir.

41:24.600 --> 41:26.790
The size of it, the complexity.

41:26.840 --> 41:29.430
Come with me, sir. It
is a glorious sight.

41:29.480 --> 41:32.310
Staircases so high I could
not see the top of them,

41:32.360 --> 41:34.910
and everywhere, in the
halls, on the bridges,

41:34.960 --> 41:36.550
carved into the very stones,

41:36.600 --> 41:38.270
his likeness...

41:39.280 --> 41:41.950
~ Whose?
~ The man who built it all, sir.

41:43.080 --> 41:45.190
John Uskglass, the Raven King.

41:45.240 --> 41:48.670
The man we have slandered in
everything we have said and done.

41:48.720 --> 41:52.070
There is a great wealth
of magic there, sir.

41:52.120 --> 41:55.350
We may go forth together,
you and I, and discover it.

41:55.400 --> 41:58.270
What you did will do more to bring
English magic into disrepute

41:58.320 --> 42:00.790
than anything Drawlight has done.

42:00.840 --> 42:02.990
It is no surprise that
he turns out a villain.

42:03.040 --> 42:06.350
But you - you are the Second
Magician in the land!

42:06.400 --> 42:07.750
Why did you come to London, sir?

42:07.800 --> 42:10.270
Why did you undertake the
restoration of English magic,

42:10.320 --> 42:11.750
if not to DO English magic?

42:11.800 --> 42:15.040
To make it respectable.

42:20.560 --> 42:22.630
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

42:22.680 --> 42:24.420
I am going home.

42:33.720 --> 42:35.660
Is it finished, then?

42:37.640 --> 42:40.510
Yes. I think it an
excellent little book.

42:41.880 --> 42:44.480
Your help was invaluable, Mr Strange.

42:46.800 --> 42:48.940
~ May I borrow it?
~ Keep it.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.800
Please. Keep it.

42:54.880 --> 42:56.350
Thank you.

43:17.720 --> 43:20.350
I'm sorry for the concern
that I gave you, Bell.

43:20.400 --> 43:22.430
I'm sorry for the things I said.

43:22.480 --> 43:25.680
I'm sorry for any sadness
my occupation has caused.

43:29.360 --> 43:30.710
Well, as you said,

43:30.760 --> 43:34.950
it was I who suggested that
you get it in the first place.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.950
You were not specific.

43:37.000 --> 43:40.710
I had in mind, in fact, that you
might become a justice of the peace.

43:40.760 --> 43:42.830
Or a landscape gardener.

43:43.480 --> 43:45.230
I did not consider
that you might become

43:45.280 --> 43:47.820
one of the greatest men of the age.

43:48.600 --> 43:51.070
It has surprised me somewhat too.

43:52.680 --> 43:54.420
It is published.

43:55.640 --> 43:57.310
You were right.

44:03.640 --> 44:06.350
If it's published, then
what are you doing?

44:06.400 --> 44:08.790
I'm writing a review of it.

44:08.840 --> 44:11.750
You cannot review a book
that you helped to write.

44:11.800 --> 44:14.110
I believe I could...

44:14.160 --> 44:16.230
if I were to say it
is an abominable book.

44:16.280 --> 44:18.230
~ Jonathan...
~ If I say it is a fraud.

44:18.280 --> 44:19.550
You're not in earnest.

44:19.600 --> 44:21.950
~ Why not?
~ Because you leave yourself open to...

44:22.000 --> 44:24.190
What would Norrell say?

44:24.240 --> 44:25.670
You cannot publish it.

44:25.720 --> 44:27.320
I fear I must.

44:28.520 --> 44:30.720
Then you and I will go home.

44:32.520 --> 44:34.260
What do you say?

44:44.480 --> 44:47.720
My Lady, I am very sorry
you do not care for us...

44:49.240 --> 44:52.630
~ .. but if only for your own
sake, you must eat something.
~ Untie me.

44:52.680 --> 44:54.430
They say that you
might hurt yourself.

44:54.480 --> 44:57.550
I'm sick of men in coats deciding
what is best for me.

44:57.600 --> 44:59.470
I may very well hurt myself.

44:59.520 --> 45:01.670
But I belong to no-one but myself.

45:01.720 --> 45:03.470
Half my life, I am in chains.

45:03.520 --> 45:06.120
The other half, I deserve to be free.

45:09.840 --> 45:11.360
Untie me.

45:17.400 --> 45:18.830
Stephen...

45:18.880 --> 45:20.630
Stephen, do you have a gun?

45:20.680 --> 45:23.310
Shoot him! Shoot these men!

45:23.360 --> 45:24.720
No!

45:32.520 --> 45:35.870
What are you doing here,
sir? I thought you were ill.

45:35.920 --> 45:38.750
I am better now, and
you have Lady Pole.

45:38.800 --> 45:41.910
~ Lead me to her, Mr Segundus.
~ Mr Childermass, please...

45:41.960 --> 45:44.990
I have ridden a long time and I
have many questions for the lady.

45:45.040 --> 45:47.270
Your letter asked us to take
Lady Pole into our care.

45:47.320 --> 45:49.390
It did not say that
you would visit her.

45:49.440 --> 45:52.270
It did not say that you
had any rights over her.

45:52.320 --> 45:54.710
It seems to me that Mr
Norrell has done enough.

45:54.760 --> 45:56.790
I do not know what
Mr Norrell has done.

45:56.840 --> 46:00.190
He will not tell me. I
am here on my own account.

46:00.240 --> 46:02.310
I am sorry, but you cannot see her.

46:02.360 --> 46:04.110
You will take me to her now.

46:04.160 --> 46:06.190
You may have your
ways of carrying on.

46:06.240 --> 46:08.590
You may shut down societies,
steal people's books,

46:08.640 --> 46:10.390
rob them of their livelihoods...

46:10.440 --> 46:14.790
but I will NOT have you
distressing a lady, sir!

46:14.840 --> 46:17.430
That is where it will stop!

46:17.480 --> 46:21.430
I have this loaded with all sorts
of unpleasant bits and pieces.

46:21.480 --> 46:24.190
And I do not expect you would
care to be shot twice

46:24.240 --> 46:26.150
within the space of two months.

46:26.200 --> 46:30.680
Take yourself off to your
master... and think again.

46:35.440 --> 46:37.040
I will return.

46:43.920 --> 46:46.280
Remember this, John Segundus.

46:49.040 --> 46:52.040
There's less to this
lady than meets the eye.

47:00.040 --> 47:02.590
Oh, I'm very glad I
did not have to shoot.

47:02.640 --> 47:04.780
I could only find walnuts.

47:05.320 --> 47:06.910
Let us get inside

47:06.960 --> 47:10.000
and make sure Lady Pole isn't
too distressed by this.

47:11.920 --> 47:14.190
The Edinburgh Review.

47:14.240 --> 47:16.670
He has murdered my book!

47:16.720 --> 47:18.990
All we have strived for!

47:19.040 --> 47:21.550
"Gilbert Norrell Esquire And
Mr Strange promises to set out

47:21.600 --> 47:23.710
"the current wondrous
state of English magic,

47:23.760 --> 47:25.070
"in all its modern glory.'

47:25.120 --> 47:27.670
"I say that if this is what
modern magic is to be,

47:27.720 --> 47:29.990
"I do not wish to be modern.

47:30.040 --> 47:32.470
"Give me the mysteries
and dreams of the past,

47:32.520 --> 47:37.320
"for they shine brighter than any of
Norrell's restrictive rainy days."

47:39.520 --> 47:41.430
That is not all, sir.

47:41.480 --> 47:45.830
"Norrell's book reads like
a letter from my great aunt.

47:45.880 --> 47:48.470
"Succeeding admirably in representing

47:48.520 --> 47:50.190
"all that is most absurd,

47:50.240 --> 47:54.510
"constipated and dull about the
blinkered Norrellite position.

47:54.560 --> 47:56.830
"Surely magic should be magical?

47:56.880 --> 47:58.830
"Surely magic is to dream?

47:58.880 --> 48:01.030
"Where is the wonder
of England's past?'

48:01.080 --> 48:02.910
"Of magic's golden age?

48:02.960 --> 48:05.910
"There is no mention of the Raven
King, except to insult him

48:05.960 --> 48:09.230
"and strike him low, to
purge him from what we do.

48:09.280 --> 48:11.870
"Norrell calls this the
magic of the modern age.

48:11.920 --> 48:15.150
"I say it is commonplace, mundane.

48:15.200 --> 48:18.030
"I say that there is much more
to English magic than this.

48:18.080 --> 48:19.870
"There is no mention
of the discoveries

48:19.920 --> 48:21.590
"I have made at my peril...

48:21.640 --> 48:23.630
"No mention of the
Raven King's Roads -

48:23.680 --> 48:27.070
"or why they have been hidden
behind the mirrors of England.

48:27.120 --> 48:29.830
"Norrell is too afraid to
question why The Raven King

48:29.880 --> 48:31.430
"would do such a thing,

48:31.480 --> 48:34.430
"too afraid to explore where
those roads might lead.

48:34.480 --> 48:37.750
"Afraid it will take us to places
we never intended to go."

48:37.800 --> 48:40.960
We must not let this
stand. You must not!

48:44.600 --> 48:48.670
Do you really think the Raven King
cares what happens to England?

48:48.720 --> 48:50.260
He does not.

48:51.800 --> 48:53.830
He abandoned us.

48:53.880 --> 48:57.350
Abandoned his throne,
rode out of England,

48:57.400 --> 49:00.230
and took the best part
of English magic with him.

49:00.280 --> 49:02.630
Surely that is enough to
mark him out as our enemy?

49:02.680 --> 49:05.310
His magic is not gone now.

49:05.360 --> 49:08.270
There it is, hidden
behind our mirrors.

49:08.320 --> 49:09.590
It is coming back.

49:09.640 --> 49:12.070
That is the magic of madness.

49:12.120 --> 49:16.200
That is wild, cruel medieval magic.

49:17.240 --> 49:20.590
We cannot have fairy princes ruling
England alongside generals,

49:20.640 --> 49:22.750
dukes and mill-owners.

49:22.800 --> 49:25.800
Such magic belongs to
an England that is dead.

49:27.040 --> 49:28.510
And it is out of our control.

49:28.560 --> 49:32.000
Then we must learn to control
it. We cannot simply ignore it.

49:39.720 --> 49:42.460
Do not think me
ungrateful, sir, but...

49:46.480 --> 49:49.980
.. I believe the period of
our collaboration is over.

49:52.120 --> 49:54.190
It seems to me that
we are too different.

49:54.240 --> 49:56.910
Well, in temperament, perhaps,

49:56.960 --> 49:59.110
but we are both magicians,

49:59.160 --> 50:02.630
and that is all either
of us cares about.

50:02.680 --> 50:06.870
If you leave this house today,
you follow your own course.

50:06.920 --> 50:10.600
Who are you going to talk
to, as we are talking now?

50:12.280 --> 50:14.020
There is no-one.

50:15.360 --> 50:17.360
We will be quite alone.

50:21.120 --> 50:23.190
I'm sorry, Mr Norrell...

50:25.760 --> 50:29.390
.. but ever since I came
back from the Peninsula,

50:29.440 --> 50:32.270
it has not felt right for me
to call myself your pupil.

50:32.320 --> 50:36.080
Well, then, we let it be
a partnership of equals.

50:37.360 --> 50:40.030
The books that I should have lent
to you and have kept from you,

50:40.080 --> 50:41.230
you shall have them.

50:41.280 --> 50:44.160
We should go to Hurtfew, you and I.

50:45.480 --> 50:47.870
You shall have the
keys to the library.

50:47.920 --> 50:49.630
I shall not even challenge
that review.

50:49.680 --> 50:52.120
Let it stand, let it stand.

50:54.480 --> 50:56.280
I'm honoured, sir.

50:57.360 --> 51:00.560
You are not usually a man
for compromise, I know.

51:01.840 --> 51:05.000
But I think I must follow
my own course from now on.

51:14.560 --> 51:16.030
Come, sir.

51:24.720 --> 51:27.590
Perhaps we can do without
these, for now.

51:29.840 --> 51:31.910
I must go back to Harley Street.

51:31.960 --> 51:33.750
I am sorry for it, my lady.

51:33.800 --> 51:35.830
It is ridiculous to part so, Stephen,

51:35.880 --> 51:39.360
when we both know we will be together
again in only a few hours.

51:42.360 --> 51:44.230
Do not be concerned about me.

51:44.280 --> 51:47.120
I feel I shall be more
comfortable here.

51:49.240 --> 51:50.910
I feel I shall.

51:53.680 --> 51:55.880
Good day to you, gentlemen.

52:00.200 --> 52:01.550
I beg your pardon...

52:01.600 --> 52:03.830
I do not wish to give you
the wrong impression of me,

52:03.880 --> 52:05.400
but, um...

52:07.240 --> 52:09.440
.. may I ask you something?

52:10.040 --> 52:11.750
What is it, sir?

52:11.800 --> 52:14.310
What is the magic...

52:14.360 --> 52:16.960
that surrounds you and her ladyship?

52:21.160 --> 52:23.500
There is a rose at your mouth.

52:25.240 --> 52:27.110
And another at hers.

52:31.280 --> 52:32.920
I see it.

52:34.320 --> 52:35.830
As clear as day.

52:35.880 --> 52:38.150
What... does... that... mean?

52:39.920 --> 52:42.920
I do not know what you
are talking about, sir.

52:52.200 --> 52:53.880
Good afternoon.

53:06.120 --> 53:09.030
~ I will not go out on the King's Roads again.
~ What?

53:09.080 --> 53:11.350
We'll go back to Shropshire,

53:11.400 --> 53:14.140
and I will cease to
do practical magic.

53:16.080 --> 53:19.350
I will write down my
thoughts in a book.

53:19.400 --> 53:22.000
I will become a theoretical magician.

53:22.800 --> 53:24.870
Jonathan.

53:24.920 --> 53:27.660
I've had enough of
these battles, Bell.

53:28.640 --> 53:31.110
Various battles in various wars...

53:32.360 --> 53:34.070
You were right.

53:34.120 --> 53:36.990
We've lost sight of
why all this was done.

53:38.160 --> 53:40.560
We've had no time to be married.

53:41.760 --> 53:43.870
And I would like that time very much.

53:43.920 --> 53:46.790
~ So would I.
~ I would like it to begin now.

53:49.080 --> 53:51.870
I am sorry to disturb you,
Mrs Strange, Merlin,

53:51.920 --> 53:53.470
but Napoleon is back.

53:53.520 --> 53:54.750
He has landed in France.

53:54.800 --> 53:57.750
~ He has marched upon Paris,
and he has captured it.
~ What?

53:57.800 --> 53:59.590
The Duke wants you to
join him in Belgium.

53:59.640 --> 54:01.630
He asks you to renew your commission.

54:01.680 --> 54:03.680
No... I cannot, we...

54:05.520 --> 54:07.270
~ I cannot go to war.
~ There is no choice.

54:07.320 --> 54:10.230
The St Serlo's Blessing leaves upon
the high tide in three hours' time

54:10.280 --> 54:11.790
with you and me on it.

54:11.840 --> 54:13.310
I am sorry, Mrs Strange,

54:13.360 --> 54:15.550
but your husband is
the army's magician

54:15.600 --> 54:17.670
and we have need of him.

54:19.000 --> 54:20.480
Goodnight.

54:36.240 --> 54:38.440
You should do as we planned.

54:40.560 --> 54:42.430
Go back to Ashfair.

54:43.280 --> 54:44.880
Make it nice.

54:48.240 --> 54:50.640
I'll be back before you know it.

54:51.160 --> 54:53.110
No, you will not.

54:53.160 --> 54:55.100
Not before I know it.

54:57.480 --> 54:59.150
You are my entire life, Bell.

54:59.200 --> 55:01.340
And you're mine, Jonathan.

55:17.040 --> 55:20.390
Yes! I have found it.

55:20.440 --> 55:22.990
The moss-oak is in there.

55:23.040 --> 55:25.760
Reach in, Stephen. Take it.

55:39.280 --> 55:42.350
That's it, Stephen. Can you feel it?

55:42.400 --> 55:43.950
There is nothing, sir.

55:44.000 --> 55:45.870
It wants to be born.

55:45.920 --> 55:47.510
~ Argh!
~ Pull!

55:47.560 --> 55:49.350
~ My fingers!
~ Pull!

55:49.400 --> 55:50.750
Argh!

55:50.800 --> 55:53.350
That's it, Stephen. Strength.

55:53.400 --> 55:56.240
Argh! Argh!

55:58.960 --> 56:00.990
Arrrgh!

56:07.280 --> 56:10.550
For a thousand years,
it has been waiting

56:10.600 --> 56:13.000
to learn what form it will take.

56:18.440 --> 56:20.240
What is that, sir?

56:23.920 --> 56:26.230
The tears of the lady,

56:26.280 --> 56:27.880
shed in pain.

56:46.640 --> 56:48.280
Ah!

57:01.920 --> 57:03.390
Beautiful.

57:05.600 --> 57:07.200
Beautiful.

57:13.200 --> 57:14.600
Well?

57:17.840 --> 57:20.710
Our conditions - how
did he receive them?

57:25.280 --> 57:27.480
You told him what we agreed?

57:29.480 --> 57:31.990
You told him that, unless
he publishes a retraction,

57:32.040 --> 57:33.910
we shall be forced
to reveal what we know

57:33.960 --> 57:36.430
of the black magic done in Spain.

57:37.920 --> 57:39.790
You told him that under
no circumstances

57:39.840 --> 57:42.580
~ would you accept him as a pupil...
~ No.

57:44.680 --> 57:47.280
No, I told him none of those things.

57:54.280 --> 57:56.880
You were right in the beginning, sir.

57:59.880 --> 58:03.600
There can be only one
magician in England.

58:07.200 --> 58:11.000
We must now consider
him our enemy, sir.

58:19.480 --> 58:21.820
We must work to destroy him...

58:23.560 --> 58:25.520
.. before he destroys us.
