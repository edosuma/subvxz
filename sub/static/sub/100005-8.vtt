is an ongoing investigation,

so I can't comment
on the recovered bodies.

01:45.959 --> 01:48.000

the Boston FBI

01:48.000 --> 01:49.792

Suffolk Downs reopened.

why your work truck went missing

Yeah.

10:49.083 --> 10:50.834
Where was your truck?

10:50.834 --> 10:53.291
[Sheik] Well, I didn't
get off work till late,

10:53.291 --> 10:56.375
so I drove the truck
straight to the track.

10:56.375 --> 10:59.792
They let a city truck park free,
so I saved a few bucks.

in that, right?

11:01.417 --> 11:04.208

Why not return the vehicle

11:04.208 --> 11:07.125
after you were done
at the track?

11:07.125 --> 11:09.875

back at the races,

11:09.875 --> 11:11.875

I had a few too many.

11:11.875 --> 11:13.959
So I did the responsible thing,

11:13.959 --> 11:15.834
left the truck
in the parking lot for the night

11:15.834 --> 11:19.166
and brought it back to work
the next day.

11:19.166 --> 11:23.709

to the racetrack.

11:23.709 --> 11:26.792

that you were incapable

11:26.792 --> 11:29.291

at the proper time?

11:29.291 --> 11:30.875
Yeah.

He's looking at five years
at Walpole.

12:09.834 --> 12:12.375
Misappropriation of what?

12:12.375 --> 12:14.792
His DPW vehicle.

12:14.792 --> 12:18.000
Look, you want Sheik
home earlier than that?

12:18.000 --> 12:20.500
Tell him he needs to start
being more open, more honest.

12:22.458 --> 12:25.417
What do you really want,
Ward?

12:25.417 --> 12:27.500
What are you after?

12:29.250 --> 12:31.458
If you're going to take
that blood money, counselor,

12:31.458 --> 12:34.083
I'm going to make you
work your ass off.

12:34.083 --> 12:35.250
[door opens]

12:40.083 --> 12:43.291
I'm on my way to ask
Judge Tirone for a subpoena.

12:43.291 --> 12:46.041
Tommy Hayes, I want you
to bring him in for round two.

12:46.041 --> 12:47.500
We got the bodies.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.417
Tommy won't be as cute
as he was last time.

12:51.291 --> 12:53.458
[inaudible]

12:53.458 --> 12:54.625
Hey.

12:57.083 --> 13:00.667
So, uh, what's the latest
on Sheik?

13:00.667 --> 13:03.125
Well, Cathy heard
at the salon

13:03.125 --> 13:04.709
that he's in front
of the grand jury today.

13:04.709 --> 13:06.041
Oh, Christ.

13:06.041 --> 13:08.250
Today's the day
he could break.

13:09.959 --> 13:12.083
Maybe we can pretend
like we've been here before.

13:12.083 --> 13:14.458
-Weren't dead bodies before.
-All right, all right.

13:14.458 --> 13:16.166
I think...

13:16.166 --> 13:18.709
I think we should just
get out of town for a while.

13:18.709 --> 13:20.375
Ehh...

13:20.375 --> 13:21.792
No.

13:21.792 --> 13:23.792
That's the chickenshit
thing to do.

13:23.792 --> 13:25.709
-It's a Chelsea move.
-No, I'm just saying.

13:25.709 --> 13:27.333
We get out of town.
By the time we come back,

13:27.333 --> 13:29.041
the whole fucking thing
will have blown over.

13:29.041 --> 13:31.458
If you're going to do
something stupid,

13:31.458 --> 13:32.834
just tell us now...

13:34.375 --> 13:36.083
so that we can bury you.

13:36.083 --> 13:38.000
[laughs]

13:41.875 --> 13:43.333
[knock at door]

13:43.333 --> 13:44.458
Yeah?

13:44.458 --> 13:46.208
[baby cooing]

13:46.208 --> 13:48.208
We're here to escort
Thomas Hayes.

13:48.208 --> 13:49.625
He ain't here.

13:49.625 --> 13:51.333
Search, you don't believe me.

13:51.333 --> 13:54.083
OK, kids, get in the other
room. Let's go, come on.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.208
[Hank] He's required to appear
in front of the grand jury.

13:56.208 --> 13:57.625
[scoffs]

13:57.625 --> 13:59.041
Required, huh?

13:59.041 --> 14:00.709
You done?
All right.

14:00.709 --> 14:02.583
Well, if you want
what's best for your husband,

14:02.583 --> 14:04.458
for your kids,

14:04.458 --> 14:06.208
you'll tell us
where to find him.

14:10.875 --> 14:11.875
What the fuck
are you looking at?

14:15.333 --> 14:16.750
Where are you from?

14:16.750 --> 14:18.417
-Here.
-No, you ain't.

14:18.417 --> 14:19.709
I'm from here.

14:19.709 --> 14:21.125
Where the fuck
are you from?

14:21.125 --> 14:22.500
[baby cries]

14:24.875 --> 14:27.583
Ma'am, I don't think
you understand the situation

14:27.583 --> 14:29.125
that your family is in.

14:29.125 --> 14:30.750
[toy rattles]

14:30.750 --> 14:32.709
Who are you
pretending to be, huh?

14:32.709 --> 14:34.041
You going to come
into my kitchen

14:34.041 --> 14:35.709
and talk to me
about my family?

14:35.709 --> 14:37.750
-Who the fuck are you?
-That's enough of that.

14:37.750 --> 14:39.458
What do you think,
you put your hair half up

14:39.458 --> 14:41.333
and drop your R's,
and you're from here?

14:41.333 --> 14:44.000
All you're missing is the hoops.
You don't get to say that.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.583
You don't get to say
you're from here.

14:45.583 --> 14:47.000
You don't even know
what that means.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
-You didn't earn that.
-You shut the fuck up.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.625
[laughs]

14:50.625 --> 14:51.834
You're a fucking clown.

14:51.834 --> 14:54.333
-Mrs. Hayes.
-Yeah, fuck you too, slim dick.

14:54.333 --> 14:55.875
-[cooing]
-Yeah, yeah.

14:57.625 --> 14:59.333
He ain't here, I told you.
Search if you want.

14:59.333 --> 15:01.834
It won't make any difference.
Tommy ain't here.

15:01.834 --> 15:03.166
He's left town.

15:06.125 --> 15:06.917
Thank you.

15:09.583 --> 15:10.750
[door slams]

15:13.333 --> 15:14.542
[doorbell rings]

15:28.625 --> 15:29.709
Cathy, have you heard?

15:31.959 --> 15:34.000
Sheik's not coming home.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.709
Five years.
He's facing five fucking years.

15:36.709 --> 15:38.625
What's the bullshit charge,
Tara?

15:38.625 --> 15:39.917
They're just trying
to scare Sheik.

15:39.917 --> 15:41.458
I'm scared, Cathy.
Five years.

15:41.458 --> 15:43.625
We got him a lawyer.
He's good.

15:43.625 --> 15:46.125
He's going to handle
all the ins and outs.

15:49.792 --> 15:51.083
Is there something else
you need?

15:53.417 --> 15:55.083
More money, Cath.

15:55.083 --> 15:58.250
Five hundred a week
don't pay for spit.

15:58.250 --> 16:00.250
How's another 50 bucks
a week sound?

16:00.250 --> 16:01.625
Can you do 100?

16:01.625 --> 16:03.000
Christ, Tara.

16:04.834 --> 16:06.792
I'm not the Bank
of Boston over here.

16:06.792 --> 16:08.667
Do you think
I like begging?

16:08.667 --> 16:10.834
How would you feel?

16:10.834 --> 16:12.458
Frankie not coming home?

16:19.542 --> 16:20.750
OK.

16:22.417 --> 16:23.792
[sniffles]

16:23.792 --> 16:25.083
OK.

16:25.083 --> 16:26.625
[sighs]

16:26.625 --> 16:28.000
You're a saint, Cathy.

16:30.291 --> 16:31.333
Hey, Tara.

16:34.291 --> 16:36.333
What are you going to do?

16:38.125 --> 16:40.500
What are you going to do
if Sheik goes to prison?

16:40.500 --> 16:42.208
He can't.

16:42.208 --> 16:44.250
I need him back, Cathy.

16:44.250 --> 16:45.375
Really? Do you, though?

16:47.208 --> 16:48.750
'Cause the last fight you had,

16:48.750 --> 16:50.834
you ended up in the ER
with a broken nose.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.417
Look, maybe you use
that money,

16:54.417 --> 16:56.500
you take those kids
and you go on a vacation.

16:56.500 --> 16:58.834
-Maybe you don't come back.
-[door opens]

17:08.041 --> 17:09.208
[knocking]

17:10.709 --> 17:12.166
Sorry, I shouldn't
be here,

17:12.166 --> 17:13.917
but you need to talk
to Jackie for me.

17:13.917 --> 17:16.333
[scoffs]
Are you fucking kidding me?

17:16.333 --> 17:18.792
My baby needs a father.
We have a child.

17:18.792 --> 17:19.792
You know what I mean.

17:21.375 --> 17:22.709
Get in.

17:26.166 --> 17:28.291
-[indistinct chatter]
-[man] Todd set me up with Josh

17:28.291 --> 17:30.083
last February
at the University Club,

17:30.083 --> 17:31.417
so we have you to thank.

17:31.417 --> 17:32.917
Siobhan, Decourcy,

17:32.917 --> 17:35.125
thank you again for hosting
our little group.

17:35.125 --> 17:37.542
Oh, not little for long,
all the great work you're doing.

17:37.542 --> 17:39.667
The same can be said
about you, pal.

17:39.667 --> 17:42.417
Josh says you're single-handedly
cleaning up Boston,

17:42.417 --> 17:44.917
gunning for the mayor's office.

17:44.917 --> 17:46.875
Well, I don't know
about all that.

17:46.875 --> 17:48.542
[Josh]
Could be a great fit

17:48.542 --> 17:50.750
to have a strong, progressive
black man in leadership,

17:50.750 --> 17:52.375
one who's tough on crime

17:52.375 --> 17:57.083
but also able and unafraid
to host an event like this.

17:57.083 --> 17:59.375
Ladies, gentlemen.

17:59.375 --> 18:01.583
Our gracious host,
Decourcy Ward,

18:01.583 --> 18:03.250
would like to say
a few words.

18:03.250 --> 18:05.417
-What? No, hold up.
-Come on down. Come on.

18:05.417 --> 18:06.834
Whoo!

18:06.834 --> 18:08.125
[applause]

18:11.208 --> 18:12.375
[chattering indistinctly]

18:16.875 --> 18:18.458
Hi.

18:18.458 --> 18:20.625
Thank you, Josh,
for the warning.

18:20.625 --> 18:22.583
[laughs]

18:22.583 --> 18:24.625
Uh...

18:24.625 --> 18:26.583
You know, play me in,
Rich.

18:26.583 --> 18:28.083
Keys.

18:28.083 --> 18:30.083
-[chuckles]
-[piano being played]

18:30.083 --> 18:31.750
Yeah.

18:31.750 --> 18:33.208
[clears throat]

18:35.458 --> 18:37.041
[laughs]

18:37.041 --> 18:40.166
You know, in the words
of Bayard Rustin,

18:40.166 --> 18:43.166
we need,
in every community,

18:43.166 --> 18:46.250
a group of angelic
troublemakers.

18:46.250 --> 18:49.000
-[laughter]
-Especially now.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.625
Especially here.

18:51.625 --> 18:57.083
Unlike before, our communities
have a reason to work together.

18:57.083 --> 19:00.959
And Dr. King's tactics
were molded by Rustin.

19:00.959 --> 19:06.542
An openly gay man who went
to jail on a morals charge.

19:06.542 --> 19:09.333
Now, as a lawyer,

19:09.333 --> 19:11.709
I'm familiar with hypocrisy.

19:11.709 --> 19:13.500
There is the law,

19:13.500 --> 19:16.625
and then there's
what's right.

19:16.625 --> 19:19.166
My work with
the St. Clair Commission,

19:19.166 --> 19:23.000
cops abusing citizens
for confessions

19:23.000 --> 19:26.041
without fearing
any repercussions,

19:26.041 --> 19:29.542
it showed me exactly how far
the system would go

19:29.542 --> 19:32.041
to protect what is
legally allowed

19:32.041 --> 19:35.041
while ignoring
what is just.

19:35.041 --> 19:38.041
[crowd mutters in agreement]

19:38.041 --> 19:41.166
So I appreciate your struggle,

19:41.166 --> 19:43.375
as I know your community
appreciates

19:43.375 --> 19:45.458
my community's struggles.

19:47.125 --> 19:50.083
You know, together,
I think that we can make

19:50.083 --> 19:53.166
the South End
a home for all of us.

19:53.166 --> 19:56.375
Knowing you have our backs
gives us strength.

19:57.500 --> 19:59.542
And I hope, eventually,

19:59.542 --> 20:02.041
the feeling
becomes mutual.

20:03.625 --> 20:05.333
So...

20:07.792 --> 20:09.875
to causing a little trouble.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.625
[laughter]

20:11.625 --> 20:13.834
-Cheers.
-[glasses clink]

20:15.250 --> 20:16.417
Excellent speech.

20:16.417 --> 20:18.667
[applause]

20:25.875 --> 20:28.125
[man on TV]
Pizza man.

20:28.125 --> 20:30.417
[woman on TV] I'm so glad
you came, pizza boy.

20:30.417 --> 20:32.083
You're my hero.

20:32.083 --> 20:33.792
[man]
Listen, I'm just a pizza man

20:33.792 --> 20:36.917
with a pizza
with double cheese.

20:36.917 --> 20:37.792
-I'm horny and I want to
fuck. Capisce?

20:37.792 --> 20:38.500
-[knock on door]

20:38.500 --> 20:40.250
It's open.

20:40.250 --> 20:42.250
-Yeah, capisce. You got it.
-[knocking persists]

20:42.250 --> 20:44.333
It's open.

20:44.333 --> 20:47.208
Jesus. About fucking time
you got here.

20:47.208 --> 20:48.959
Look, if you--

20:48.959 --> 20:50.917
Jenny, hey.

20:50.917 --> 20:53.250
-I-- I wasn't--
-For some reason, Jackie,

20:53.250 --> 20:55.041
that girl seems to think
you're a good person.

20:55.041 --> 20:57.583
What-- What are you talking--
Who? Yvette?

20:57.583 --> 20:58.917
Yeah.

21:01.458 --> 21:04.250
Prove her wrong.
Show her the Jackie Rohr I know.

21:04.250 --> 21:06.542
She's nuts, honey.
I can't control her.

21:06.542 --> 21:08.333
Well, she showed up
at my door again.

21:08.333 --> 21:10.166
Yeah, you've been a prick
to me for 20 years.

21:10.166 --> 21:12.250
Now go be a prick
to that slant-eyed bitch

21:12.250 --> 21:13.500
and get her the fuck
out of my life.

21:13.500 --> 21:15.250
I will,
I promise you.

21:22.250 --> 21:23.917
Hey, you in some kind
of trouble?

21:23.917 --> 21:26.792
Me? What? No, no.

21:26.792 --> 21:28.583
Not any more than usual.
Why?

21:28.583 --> 21:31.959
Today some woman, you know,
says her car broke down.

21:31.959 --> 21:33.333
Her husband left her...

21:33.333 --> 21:34.500
[door opens]

21:35.959 --> 21:37.500
Sorry I'm late.

21:39.333 --> 21:41.208
Jesus fucking Christ.

21:41.208 --> 21:43.792
[laughs]

21:43.792 --> 21:45.959
Good luck.

21:45.959 --> 21:47.458
Hmm, she's cute.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.125
-[door opens and closes]
-Fuck me.

21:51.125 --> 21:52.500
[Decourcy]
Thank you.

21:53.750 --> 21:54.959
Good night, sir.

22:08.750 --> 22:10.834
That was quite the preview,
Decourcy...

22:12.458 --> 22:13.959
for your campaign speech.

22:15.959 --> 22:17.375
I was...

22:17.375 --> 22:20.458
I was just vamping.
Nothing more.

22:20.458 --> 22:22.375
Josh said he's going to talk
to the party leaders

22:22.375 --> 22:24.333
about where you'd fit

22:24.333 --> 22:26.834
in the next election cycle.

22:26.834 --> 22:30.125
Running for office takes time
and money,

22:30.125 --> 22:32.041
and time raising money.

22:32.041 --> 22:36.208
Well, the South End is teeming
with new and gentrified cash.

22:36.208 --> 22:39.125
All you'd have to do
is keep Excalibur shining.

22:39.125 --> 22:40.709
Yeah, well,

22:40.709 --> 22:44.500
tomorrow I'm going to go
to a woman's home

22:44.500 --> 22:46.542
and threaten to destroy
her family

22:46.542 --> 22:49.333
if her husband doesn't tell me
what I want to hear.

22:49.333 --> 22:51.583
And the people I'm going
to ask her to betray

22:51.583 --> 22:53.625
are probably her cousins,

22:53.625 --> 22:55.792
people she's known
her whole life.

22:57.166 --> 22:58.250
So...

22:59.792 --> 23:02.291
Decourcy,
you have a gift,

23:02.291 --> 23:04.250
and an opportunity,

23:04.250 --> 23:07.792
and an obligation to put them
both to good use.

23:07.792 --> 23:10.166
Whatever you do,
don't run for mayor.

23:10.166 --> 23:13.166
Mayor of Boston
is a dead end

23:13.166 --> 23:15.208
for anyone's
political career.

23:15.208 --> 23:16.583
[scoffs]

23:16.583 --> 23:18.250
Set your sights higher.

23:18.250 --> 23:19.792
Governor.

23:19.792 --> 23:21.250
Senator.

23:23.166 --> 23:24.917
You too.

23:24.917 --> 23:29.166
Governor Ward.
That sounds pretty good.

23:29.166 --> 23:30.583
Good night, all.

23:36.125 --> 23:38.250
Well, you've been
awfully quiet.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.458
You agree with them?

23:41.250 --> 23:43.625
That's enough politics
for one night.

23:45.166 --> 23:47.125
Get me out of this
damn dress.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.250
Can't sleep?

24:13.667 --> 24:15.792
Yeah, me neither.

24:15.792 --> 24:17.542
You mind?

24:17.542 --> 24:18.792
Sure.

24:26.834 --> 24:28.667
[sighs]

24:28.667 --> 24:31.917
Did you hear they're tearing
down Deer Island Prison?

24:31.917 --> 24:33.834
They're going to build
a water treatment plant.

24:33.834 --> 24:35.709
Old Mother Hubbard
was jailed there.

24:35.709 --> 24:37.083
Hmm.

24:38.417 --> 24:39.834
"Old Mother Hubbard...

24:42.500 --> 24:46.500
went to the cupboard
to get her poor dog a bone.

24:46.500 --> 24:48.667
And when she got there,

24:48.667 --> 24:50.583
the cupboard was bare."

24:50.583 --> 24:53.125
My father used to say
that nursery rhyme to me.

24:54.917 --> 24:56.750
And then he ended up
in Deer Island Prison,

24:56.750 --> 24:58.041
just like her.

24:58.041 --> 25:00.041
That must have been hard.

25:00.041 --> 25:03.500
I spent my whole life running
from him from Charlestown.

25:03.500 --> 25:05.375
Yet you came back.

25:07.709 --> 25:09.208
The devil you know.

25:12.375 --> 25:14.750
Tell her I put Yvette
on a plane,

25:14.750 --> 25:16.834
never to be seen again.

25:16.834 --> 25:20.875
He took care of the dragon lady.
She'll never come back.

25:20.875 --> 25:22.417
I'm coming over to see Bennie.

25:22.417 --> 25:24.875
Oh, she's not here, asshole.

25:24.875 --> 25:27.291
She's got a session
at that rehab place.

25:27.291 --> 25:29.709
Jenny's about to go
pick her up.

25:29.709 --> 25:31.375
Wait, no, see, actually--

25:34.792 --> 25:36.542
Nice, Ma.

25:36.542 --> 25:38.834
Now I got to beat traffic
and get there before he does.

25:38.834 --> 25:41.917
It's hard for me to remember
which of you is the good parent

25:41.917 --> 25:43.834
and which is the bad.

25:43.834 --> 25:45.542
[slams phone into receiver]

25:48.959 --> 25:50.583
You and I both know
that him taking

25:50.583 --> 25:52.792
the work trucks to the track
is a lie.

25:52.792 --> 25:55.166
I don't know.

25:55.166 --> 25:56.458
I got no part in this.

25:56.458 --> 25:58.083
I'm his wife, that's all.

25:58.083 --> 26:00.625
Look, Mrs. Sheehan,
you seem like a good person.

26:00.625 --> 26:03.125
And because of that,
this is difficult for you.

26:03.125 --> 26:04.625
So I'll...

26:04.625 --> 26:07.417
I'll just be
on the level, hmm?

26:12.125 --> 26:15.583
We've been keeping an eye
on your finances.

26:18.083 --> 26:21.250
Now, since your husband's
been in custody,

26:21.250 --> 26:25.250
you've been depositing
exactly $500

26:25.250 --> 26:27.375
every Thursday.

26:27.375 --> 26:29.333
Now, you don't have a job.

26:29.333 --> 26:32.875
Sheik obviously isn't earning
any money in jail.

26:32.875 --> 26:35.375
You mind telling me
where the money's coming from?

26:35.375 --> 26:38.166
My parents.

26:38.166 --> 26:39.250
They're giving me some.

26:40.667 --> 26:42.250
Parents? Oh.

26:44.125 --> 26:45.375
The parents.

26:45.375 --> 26:46.959
The ones on food stamps...

26:48.667 --> 26:50.583
with even less in the bank
than you?

26:53.875 --> 26:54.959
I gamble.

26:54.959 --> 26:56.792
OK.

26:56.792 --> 26:58.792
Clearly we're getting nowhere.
Thank you for your time.

27:00.667 --> 27:02.667
You're not listening
to me, Mr. Ward.

27:02.667 --> 27:04.208
I gamble.

27:05.917 --> 27:07.000
Locally.

27:12.834 --> 27:14.667
Oh, sir, hey, excuse me.

27:14.667 --> 27:17.500
Anyone ever tell you that you
look just like Sophia Loren?

27:17.500 --> 27:19.542
All the time.
Who are you here to see?

27:19.542 --> 27:21.250
-My daughter.
-Name?

27:21.250 --> 27:22.667
Rohr. Benedetta Rohr.

27:22.667 --> 27:24.542
-And you are?
-I'm her father.

27:24.542 --> 27:26.333
Name's Jackie.
Jackie Rohr.

27:28.834 --> 27:30.417
I'm not seeing you
on the parental list.

27:30.417 --> 27:32.166
It's John, officially.

27:32.166 --> 27:34.667
Plus, I'm fucking FBI,
so...

27:34.667 --> 27:37.000
Wow. Cool.
I still can't let you enter.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.291
We have very strict rules
for very good reasons.

27:39.291 --> 27:42.959
OK, you have rules so that
you can keep bad guys out.

27:42.959 --> 27:44.792
But, see, I'm one
of the good guys.

27:44.792 --> 27:46.667
But that could change
very quickly, Grace.

27:46.667 --> 27:48.750
Are you threatening me?
Is that a threat?

27:48.750 --> 27:52.333
Honey, you know exactly
what this is.

27:52.333 --> 27:53.667
Now, let me through.

27:53.667 --> 27:55.166
I can't do that, sir.

27:55.166 --> 27:57.709
-Please just leave.
-Or else what?

27:57.709 --> 27:59.250
[Grace]
Or else I'll call security.

27:59.250 --> 28:00.500
[Jackie]
Call security?

28:00.500 --> 28:02.375
Call whoever
the fuck you want!

28:02.375 --> 28:04.083
Jackie, how is this
helping Benny?

28:04.083 --> 28:06.542
My name is not on this list.

28:06.542 --> 28:08.542
Where's my fucking name?

28:08.542 --> 28:11.208
I'm her father for fuck's sake!

28:11.208 --> 28:13.041
Oh, yeah?
You're her father, huh?

28:13.041 --> 28:15.083
Then start behaving like one.

28:15.083 --> 28:17.166
Just go away.

28:23.125 --> 28:24.375
I'm so sorry.

28:31.417 --> 28:33.917
I didn't even know there were
Iranian restaurants in Boston.

28:33.917 --> 28:36.083
Well, that's because you're
gastronomically illiterate.

28:36.083 --> 28:37.875
You think Howard Johnson
is fine dining.

28:39.500 --> 28:40.583
Thanks.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.458
[speaking Persian]

28:46.458 --> 28:48.208
[responds in Persian]

28:50.917 --> 28:52.291
You speak Arab?

28:52.291 --> 28:53.583
Persian.

28:55.458 --> 28:56.625
So I put out a BOLO

28:56.625 --> 28:58.750
across the northeast
for Tommy Hayes.

28:58.750 --> 29:00.792
You finish making contact
with those other places?

29:00.792 --> 29:03.291
Erie, Sullivan,
Ogemaw counties.

29:03.291 --> 29:05.125
Everywhere Hayes
has a past or

29:05.125 --> 29:06.709
Family ties.

29:06.709 --> 29:07.834
Now we wait.

29:09.417 --> 29:11.583
No. Now we eat.

29:18.917 --> 29:20.667
What about Jackie's wife?

29:20.667 --> 29:22.667
She say anything
worth listening to?

29:22.667 --> 29:25.208
Yeah. Jackie went down
to Florida

29:25.208 --> 29:27.625
to bail out some CI.

29:27.625 --> 29:29.875
It might be that Clay Roach.

29:29.875 --> 29:31.917
The one Michaela
interviewed.

29:31.917 --> 29:34.166
I'm going to go to
Bromley Heath later to find him.

29:34.166 --> 29:37.041
I'm happy to tag along while
we wait for news on Tommy Hayes.

29:40.208 --> 29:41.959
What?

29:43.125 --> 29:44.125
The wife.

29:45.583 --> 29:47.542
She was right.

29:47.542 --> 29:48.959
[laughs]

29:48.959 --> 29:50.917
I'm not from there.

29:50.917 --> 29:52.625
I'm from here.

29:54.542 --> 29:56.917
[Hank]
Hey, yo, Decourcy.

29:59.500 --> 30:01.417
How did things go
with Sheik's wife?

30:01.417 --> 30:03.083
Oh, pure joy.

30:03.083 --> 30:04.917
I need you to follow
a crumb she threw me.

30:04.917 --> 30:06.709
You know any bookies?

30:06.709 --> 30:08.959
One that might be connected
to Kinicki, Hayes or Sheehan?

30:08.959 --> 30:12.250
I'm not a betting man,
but I can ask around, sure.

30:12.250 --> 30:13.667
Alright.

30:15.792 --> 30:17.834
Hey, be sure to try that.

30:20.166 --> 30:21.750
-There you are.
-[loud chatter]

30:21.750 --> 30:23.000
Let's see those muscles.

30:24.792 --> 30:26.417
You guys want to go
on an adventure?

30:26.417 --> 30:27.917
Come on, come on.

30:27.917 --> 30:29.500
Let's go. Look out for cars.
Hold hands.

30:31.917 --> 30:34.083
[plane motor rumbles]

30:34.083 --> 30:35.792
What are those?

30:35.792 --> 30:37.875
They call those
the Five Sisters.

30:39.542 --> 30:40.625
They're breakwaters.

30:40.625 --> 30:43.041
What are breakwaters,
Daddy?

30:43.041 --> 30:44.875
Well, you see,

30:44.875 --> 30:47.542
when there's a big storm,

30:47.542 --> 30:51.041
huge waves come rolling in.

30:52.542 --> 30:54.834
One rolled through
right now,

30:54.834 --> 30:58.041
you, you, me,

30:58.041 --> 31:01.083
our car would be washed
right out to sea.

31:01.083 --> 31:03.041
-Cool.
-Even that house?

31:03.041 --> 31:04.542
That house?

31:04.542 --> 31:07.792
That house would be a billion
little pieces.

31:07.792 --> 31:10.417
And that's why they built
the breakwater,

31:10.417 --> 31:12.709
to break the water.

31:12.709 --> 31:15.709
To take the hit
so that you don't have to.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.333
[Marie] Where do you think
that plane came from?

31:25.333 --> 31:26.917
I don't know.

31:32.542 --> 31:34.041
Maybe France, huh?

31:35.417 --> 31:36.500
Or Japan.

31:40.458 --> 31:42.583
The world is a big...

31:42.583 --> 31:44.417
big place.

31:46.625 --> 31:48.917
It's a lot bigger
than Charlestown.

31:50.542 --> 31:52.083
My wish for you...

31:53.875 --> 31:56.583
what your mother and I
really want...

31:56.583 --> 31:59.041
is for yous three
to grow up together.

32:01.166 --> 32:02.959
To look after one another.

32:05.583 --> 32:07.208
Go see the world.

32:10.375 --> 32:11.875
But I don't want to leave.

32:11.875 --> 32:14.542
What do you know, dummy?
Huh?

32:14.542 --> 32:16.917
You never been anywhere.

32:16.917 --> 32:20.750
You can always come home
to me and your mother.

32:22.709 --> 32:24.959
You guys always
have a home here.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.208
No matter what.

32:44.583 --> 32:46.333
[drops papers on table]

32:46.333 --> 32:48.625
I'm not under arrest?

32:48.625 --> 32:50.166
Why am I here?

32:50.166 --> 32:52.625
You're a bookie,
I'm a state trooper.

32:52.625 --> 32:54.250
I investigate.

32:54.250 --> 32:55.917
You're investigating me?
Come on.

32:55.917 --> 32:59.125
Well, it depends on how you
answer my first question.

32:59.125 --> 33:00.625
Answer honestly,
you go home.

33:00.625 --> 33:02.291
You don't, you don't.

33:02.291 --> 33:03.333
Have a seat?

33:03.333 --> 33:04.500
I'm good.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.166
You ever take a bet
from Sheik Sheehan

33:08.166 --> 33:09.125
or his wife Tara?

33:11.375 --> 33:12.875
Nope.

33:12.875 --> 33:14.333
I haven't even
heard of them.

33:14.333 --> 33:16.375
OK.

33:16.375 --> 33:18.000
Tell me about
the other bookies.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.375
You guys get along?

33:19.375 --> 33:21.542
We stay out
of each other's way.

33:21.542 --> 33:23.208
Which ones don't?

33:23.208 --> 33:24.667
Uh...

33:24.667 --> 33:27.083
Well, Vito Lupo.

33:27.083 --> 33:29.208
But word on the street
is he's retired.

33:31.333 --> 33:32.875
OK.

33:32.875 --> 33:34.125
Anyone else?

33:36.458 --> 33:38.667
Richie Ryan.

33:38.667 --> 33:40.625
Lousy Charlestown mick fuck.

33:42.458 --> 33:44.458
He owes me 400 bucks.

33:44.458 --> 33:46.166
[pen scratching]

33:59.000 --> 34:01.917
-Roach?
-[knock on door]

34:01.917 --> 34:03.750
You're not in trouble,
all right?

34:03.750 --> 34:06.083
I-I-I just want to ask you
a few questions.

34:07.667 --> 34:08.917
He went out.

34:10.333 --> 34:11.667
Um... Roach?

34:11.667 --> 34:13.375
Are you sure?

34:13.375 --> 34:17.583
Yup. I spent quite a bit of time
at the peephole, you know.

34:19.834 --> 34:22.542
Any idea where he is?

34:22.542 --> 34:23.834
Can't imagine.

34:26.583 --> 34:29.709
Has Roach left town
in the last few weeks?

34:29.709 --> 34:31.291
To Florida, maybe?

34:31.291 --> 34:33.917
Kid was gone for a bit.

34:33.917 --> 34:36.083
Could have been in Florida.

34:36.083 --> 34:37.667
Could have been in jail.

34:37.667 --> 34:39.583
Could have just been
nodding out

34:39.583 --> 34:42.917
in some basement junkie
shithole, you know?

34:44.417 --> 34:45.750
Hey, I need a favor.

34:45.750 --> 34:47.542
Think you can make some calls
quietly?

34:47.542 --> 34:50.959
See if a guy from your
Boston office, Jackie Rohr,

34:50.959 --> 34:53.250
sprung a CI out of
Miami-Dade lockup.

34:53.250 --> 34:55.625
Might be named, uh,
Clay Roach.

34:58.125 --> 34:59.458
Uh-huh.

34:59.458 --> 35:02.375
Two, maybe three weeks ago.

35:04.709 --> 35:05.917
Yeah, real quiet.

35:05.917 --> 35:07.125
[laughs]

35:07.125 --> 35:08.125
Jackie Rohr's got big ears.

35:09.750 --> 35:11.583
Big ears, tiny pecker.

35:13.041 --> 35:14.875
Any word on Tommy Hayes?

35:14.875 --> 35:17.542
Still waiting.
And you?

35:17.542 --> 35:20.125
You figure out which bookies
know Sheik's wife?

35:21.834 --> 35:23.458
Where's Decourcy?

35:23.458 --> 35:25.625
So when Tara Sheehan
said she was gambling,

35:25.625 --> 35:27.375
she was pointing you
to Richard Ryan,

35:27.375 --> 35:30.166
local bookie, been around
since Ike was president.

35:30.166 --> 35:31.834
He's the father of Frances
and James Ryan,

35:31.834 --> 35:34.250
two typical townie rim jobs.

35:34.250 --> 35:36.166
Hmm. OK.

35:36.166 --> 35:38.166
The Ryan brothers.

35:38.166 --> 35:39.875
They dirty?

35:39.875 --> 35:42.000
Well, Frances seems to have kept
his nose pretty clean,

35:42.000 --> 35:44.333
but James, he's a national
treasure.

35:44.333 --> 35:46.291
Remember how after
the Kinicki disappearance,

35:46.291 --> 35:47.583
Sheik went on
that two-year bender?

35:47.583 --> 35:49.208
-Uh-huh.
-Yeah.

35:49.208 --> 35:51.208
The younger Ryan brother
was his drinking buddy.

35:51.208 --> 35:53.959
Got booked together three times
in '89 for public intox.

35:53.959 --> 35:55.750
Hmm.

35:55.750 --> 35:57.667
James Ryan, huh?

35:57.667 --> 36:00.000
And here's the other
curious thing.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.333
Most of his file is sealed.

36:04.125 --> 36:06.625
Meaning maybe
he's an informant.

36:06.625 --> 36:07.834
For who?

36:07.834 --> 36:10.375
Not the state. Not the BPD.

36:10.375 --> 36:11.834
Not Suffolk County.

36:17.083 --> 36:19.542
Leaving our friends
at the FBI.

36:24.125 --> 36:25.709
James Ryan.

36:31.667 --> 36:33.333
Tail him.

36:33.333 --> 36:35.125
But don't bring him in yet.
No.

36:35.125 --> 36:37.583
Just keep an eye on him.

36:37.583 --> 36:39.291
If he is working
with the FBI,

36:39.291 --> 36:40.875
let's hope he shows us who.

36:47.959 --> 36:49.792
[TV chatter]

36:56.250 --> 36:58.083
Hey, Beth, how you doing?

36:58.083 --> 36:59.667
Whiskey. Neat.

37:02.625 --> 37:04.125
Fucking Bird.

37:04.125 --> 37:05.667
Shitty way
to go out, huh?

37:05.667 --> 37:07.208
Limping.

37:08.834 --> 37:11.041
How old are you, Brian?

37:11.041 --> 37:13.917
What the fuck
do you care?

37:13.917 --> 37:15.458
Is that how you want
to go out?

37:15.458 --> 37:17.333
Thanks. Limping?

37:22.458 --> 37:24.917
Depositors Trust.
Medford.

37:26.417 --> 37:27.583
Yeah?

37:29.458 --> 37:32.250
I hear three cops
got busted for that.

37:34.625 --> 37:36.417
Cops...

37:36.417 --> 37:38.500
robbing a bank.

37:38.500 --> 37:41.083
You don't think they caught
all of them, do you?

37:43.333 --> 37:45.083
You remember
Irish Red Kelley?

37:45.083 --> 37:46.959
The Plymouth Mail robbery.

37:46.959 --> 37:49.792
You have any idea how much he
got away with those five years

37:49.792 --> 37:52.333
they were trying to catch him
for that job?

37:52.333 --> 37:53.458
Hmm.

37:54.709 --> 37:56.291
What's your fucking point?

37:59.083 --> 38:01.125
Depositors Trust.
Red Kelley.

38:02.959 --> 38:05.000
The police,
they never caught on

38:05.000 --> 38:07.125
because the people that pulled
off those jobs

38:07.125 --> 38:08.792
are the same people they never
fucking suspected

38:08.792 --> 38:10.083
in the first place.

38:10.083 --> 38:11.959
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

38:11.959 --> 38:14.250
Are you asking what I think
you're asking me right now?

38:14.250 --> 38:15.667
[keys rattle]

38:19.208 --> 38:21.542
It's hard to feel bad
for Bird.

38:21.542 --> 38:26.291
I mean, he's limping away
with $26 million.

38:32.291 --> 38:34.375
I wanted to see you

38:34.375 --> 38:37.000
so we could talk
bail package.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.834
You are coming to me

38:38.834 --> 38:40.959
to help my client?

38:40.959 --> 38:42.333
What do you want?

38:42.333 --> 38:45.250
I want you, Mr. Moore,

38:45.250 --> 38:47.083
to drop a name
in open court.

38:47.083 --> 38:49.417
Say that your client
is being held

38:49.417 --> 38:51.709
on the word of a top echelon
informant.

38:51.709 --> 38:53.667
The CI's file is sealed,

38:53.667 --> 38:55.041
so only a judge can open it.

38:55.041 --> 38:58.000
Pre-trial hearing,
you argue for discovery.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.792
Say you need access.

38:59.792 --> 39:01.375
Meaning you need access.

39:01.375 --> 39:03.375
Either way,
your client goes home.

39:04.834 --> 39:07.375
All you got to do is say
"James Ryan."

39:08.458 --> 39:10.083
So Sheik gets what he wants,

39:10.083 --> 39:11.208
you get what you want.

39:11.208 --> 39:12.667
What about me?

39:12.667 --> 39:15.792
I break the law to help you?

39:15.792 --> 39:17.000
Why?

39:19.125 --> 39:20.542
You tell me why,
counselor.

39:23.917 --> 39:25.667
No, thanks.

39:25.667 --> 39:28.542
I represent 15 Sheik Sheehans.

39:28.542 --> 39:30.709
This one stays in jail.

39:30.709 --> 39:33.959
I still sleep at night
in my bed.

39:35.709 --> 39:37.208
Nice try.

39:43.083 --> 39:45.041
So how are you settling in then,
Reverend Hanlon?

39:45.041 --> 39:47.667
Not bad, not bad.

39:47.667 --> 39:49.625
Feels good to be back
in the old neighborhood.

39:49.625 --> 39:51.959
We are glad you're here,

39:51.959 --> 39:54.166
after what we've been
dealing with.

39:54.166 --> 39:56.333
What did I miss, ladies?

39:56.333 --> 39:58.542
Come in, Captain Lewis.

39:58.542 --> 40:00.917
[Lewis] How many times
I got to tell you, Shirley,

40:00.917 --> 40:03.166
call me Shag.

40:03.166 --> 40:05.834
It's good to see you too,
Siobhan.

40:05.834 --> 40:07.417
Hmm.

40:08.959 --> 40:10.625
What's wrong?

40:10.625 --> 40:11.875
Hmm.

40:11.875 --> 40:13.709
Normally, I wouldn't
say anything.

40:13.709 --> 40:17.583
But if we can't be truthful
with each other,

40:17.583 --> 40:20.208
we can't expect the community
to be either.

40:20.208 --> 40:22.417
I don't know
how I can trust you.

40:22.417 --> 40:24.291
Not after Reverend Fields.

40:24.291 --> 40:26.709
Fields acted inappropriately.

40:26.709 --> 40:29.959
He did. Still, the way you went
about exposing him--

40:29.959 --> 40:31.667
Was best for the community.

40:31.667 --> 40:34.458
I have my reservations,
concerns, working with you.

40:34.458 --> 40:36.291
I understand.

40:36.291 --> 40:38.458
But I'm sure you'll come around,
like Decourcy did.

40:50.625 --> 40:52.458
[Jackie] These goddamn
elevators take forever.

41:04.667 --> 41:07.500
D.
Long time no see.

41:08.834 --> 41:11.917
Oh, I've seen you...
on TV,

41:11.917 --> 41:15.750
commenting without commenting
about the Revere Beach heist.

41:15.750 --> 41:18.542
Might as well have given
the case files to the killers.

41:18.542 --> 41:20.458
Well, as usual, you're not
seeing the big picture.

41:20.458 --> 41:22.041
The vast panorama.

41:22.041 --> 41:24.583
Oh, I am.

41:24.583 --> 41:26.625
I am.

41:26.625 --> 41:29.125
See, you're pissed at me because
I didn't do what you wanted.

41:29.125 --> 41:30.834
And now you're willing
to fuck up this case

41:30.834 --> 41:32.083
to school my ass.

41:32.083 --> 41:33.834
We had an agreement,
you and me.

41:33.834 --> 41:35.375
Focus on the heist.

41:35.375 --> 41:37.458
The guards thaw
the Kinicki case,

41:37.458 --> 41:39.083
pump the grand jury.

41:39.083 --> 41:41.458
But you, you wander off
like some kid

41:41.458 --> 41:43.083
that hears the fucking
ice-cream truck

41:43.083 --> 41:46.333
to chase guns in Roxbury,
and what do you get?

41:46.333 --> 41:47.917
You get shit on your shoes.

41:47.917 --> 41:49.542
So you want to listen to me,

41:49.542 --> 41:51.625
do what it was
that we agreed to,

41:51.625 --> 41:53.792
fine, I'm happy
to be of service.

41:53.792 --> 41:56.709
But you want an ice-cream
sandwich, go fuck yourself.

42:10.709 --> 42:12.709
Good night, Uncle Jimmy.
Good night, Aunt Corie.

42:12.709 --> 42:13.792
Good night.

42:25.917 --> 42:28.000
[Cathy]
So you decided, huh?

42:28.000 --> 42:30.125
You decided you want to do
another job?

42:30.125 --> 42:31.583
Hey, keep your voice down.

42:31.583 --> 42:33.375
You're going to wake up
the kids, Cathy.

42:33.375 --> 42:35.250
Maybe your kids come in here,

42:35.250 --> 42:37.375
you'll realize exactly
what you have to lose.

42:37.375 --> 42:38.709
Maybe then
you'll smarten up.

42:38.709 --> 42:40.208
You'll actually
think about this.

42:40.208 --> 42:42.166
All I do is think about it.

42:42.166 --> 42:43.917
About you and the kids.

42:43.917 --> 42:45.583
The bills.

42:45.583 --> 42:48.333
About Ma and Jimmy
and Sheik and Tommy

42:48.333 --> 42:49.750
and their wives,
their kids.

42:51.542 --> 42:54.458
[Corie]
Jimmy, get away from there.

42:54.458 --> 42:56.250
The FBI's got the bodies.

42:56.250 --> 42:58.125
There is a grand jury on.

42:58.125 --> 43:00.834
And you want to do
another job?

43:02.333 --> 43:04.125
And with half
your normal crew?

43:04.125 --> 43:05.542
Cathy...

43:07.417 --> 43:08.959
this is our way out.

43:11.458 --> 43:14.000
Not only do we get enough cash
to breathe a little bit,

43:14.000 --> 43:14.959
here's the plan.

43:16.625 --> 43:19.875
We're going to frame
another crew for this heist.

43:19.875 --> 43:23.417
And that'll throw the FBI off
our trail for the Revere job.

43:27.500 --> 43:29.458
[Jimmy]
So that's it, huh?

43:29.458 --> 43:31.792
You go tomorrow?

43:31.792 --> 43:33.792
Not one extra day?

43:33.792 --> 43:36.083
I got to work on Monday, Jimmy.

43:36.083 --> 43:37.458
You got to work?

43:37.458 --> 43:38.709
Yeah.

43:38.709 --> 43:40.500
And you wouldn't know it,

43:40.500 --> 43:42.542
but taking two kids
to the airport,

43:42.542 --> 43:44.458
keeping them quiet on the plane,
it's a bitch.

43:44.458 --> 43:46.166
How-- How-- Come here.

43:46.166 --> 43:49.417
How about I go with you?

43:49.417 --> 43:51.667
All right?
Sit down, sit down.

43:53.166 --> 43:55.959
And we can drive.

43:55.959 --> 43:57.500
I'll drive.

43:57.500 --> 43:59.250
The whole way.

43:59.250 --> 44:01.000
And then I'll come back...

44:01.000 --> 44:02.458
[sighs]
Jimmy.

44:02.458 --> 44:04.041
...the very next day.

44:04.041 --> 44:05.709
-But Jimmy...
-Hey, Corie.

44:05.709 --> 44:07.625
I promise, OK?

44:08.959 --> 44:09.834
Jimmy...

44:14.417 --> 44:16.458
-Jimmy--
-I love you, Corie.

44:18.208 --> 44:19.625
I love you.

44:32.834 --> 44:34.709
-Get a condom.
-What?

44:34.709 --> 44:36.458
-Get a condom.
-It's fine.

44:36.458 --> 44:37.709
I haven't been with anybody.

44:37.709 --> 44:39.333
Well, I have.

44:41.917 --> 44:42.959
I don't care.

44:45.291 --> 44:46.792
I want to run away with you.

44:46.792 --> 44:47.709
Jimmy--

44:53.458 --> 44:54.792
-Jimmy--
-What?

44:57.750 --> 45:00.125
What, Corie? What?

45:00.125 --> 45:02.667
I haven't just been
with somebody else.

45:02.667 --> 45:04.500
I'm with someone.

45:06.458 --> 45:08.125
Leave him.

45:08.125 --> 45:10.834
Corie, I'm telling you,
we can make this work.

45:10.834 --> 45:12.709
-You're not following me.
-I am following you.

45:12.709 --> 45:14.250
Jimmy, I'm engaged.

45:14.250 --> 45:15.834
You're engaged?

45:17.250 --> 45:18.583
Yeah.

45:18.583 --> 45:21.250
To who? Huh?
What the fuck?

45:21.250 --> 45:22.792
Me and the girls,
we're going--

45:22.792 --> 45:23.917
We're going to be
moving in with him.

45:27.750 --> 45:29.709
You're marrying this guy?

45:31.417 --> 45:33.083
Who the fuck is he, huh?

45:34.583 --> 45:36.125
Are you fucking with me?

45:36.125 --> 45:38.792
Are you fucking with me?
Where's your fucking ring?

45:38.792 --> 45:41.875
Where's the fucking rock?
You're fucking with me.

45:41.875 --> 45:43.667
Jimmy, you kept pushing me.

45:43.667 --> 45:45.458
You just kept pushing me

45:45.458 --> 45:46.792
and pushing me,
and...

45:46.792 --> 45:48.834
Why couldn't you just
shut up and fuck me?

45:48.834 --> 45:51.458
Why you got to keep
pushing me all the time, always?

45:51.458 --> 45:53.208
You're always pushing me.

45:53.208 --> 45:54.291
Oh, fuck.

45:55.959 --> 45:57.834
[sighs]
I'm sorry.

45:57.834 --> 45:59.625
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you before I got here,

45:59.625 --> 46:01.417
but you said
we wouldn't see you.

46:01.417 --> 46:02.583

46:05.333 --> 46:07.000
