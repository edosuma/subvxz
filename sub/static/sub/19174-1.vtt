a yuko. </i>
[judo move]

01:22.580 --> 01:25.410
<i>The atmosphere for this final
round is very tense.</i>

01:25.410 --> 01:26.570
This is psychological warfare.

01:26.580 --> 01:31.580
<i>These initial tactics are used to 
check the opponent's state.</i>

01:35.420 --> 01:38.090
<i>As I was saying, Go Du Yeong 
is using a foot technique. </i>

01:38.090 --> 01:40.430
<i>Nice! Nice! Just like that!</i>

01:40.430 --> 01:41.760
<i>Very good. A positive tripping.</i>

01:41.760 --> 01:42.420
<i>Pretty good try.</i>

01:42.430 --> 01:45.920
<i>Go Du Yeong is working hard to
score more points. </i>

01:50.610 --> 01:51.940
<i>Go Du Yeong must not back down.</i>

01:51.940 --> 01:54.600
<i>His opponent is making a
very aggressive attack.</i>

01:54.610 --> 01:55.600
<i>A grip move!</i>

01:55.610 --> 01:56.940
<i>A grip move!</i>

01:56.950 --> 01:56.980
<i>Wow. A "waza-ari" has been
scored against Go Du Yeong.</i>

01:56.980 --> 01:59.780
<i>Wow. A "waza-ari" has been
scored against Go Du Yeong.</i>

01:59.780 --> 02:02.270
<i>He must first escape, then he
can possibly score a sequential
"waza-ari."</i>

02:02.280 --> 02:05.450
Go Du Yeong must escape.

02:06.620 --> 02:09.110
<i>Go Du Yeong has managed to
escape.</i>

02:09.120 --> 02:11.280
<i>Okay, a foot sweep!</i>

02:11.290 --> 02:12.450
<i>A foot sweep and he has a grip!</i>

02:12.460 --> 02:14.120
<i>Very good</i>

02:44.330 --> 02:46.820
Du Yeong!

02:54.840 --> 02:57.830

serious injury. </i>

[older brother]

03:20.030 --> 03:22.360
You applied again this year?

03:22.360 --> 03:24.360
Yes, I'm back again.

03:24.370 --> 03:29.530
If you are released on parole, 
how do you plan to live after
you get out?

03:29.540 --> 03:32.200
Looking here,

03:32.210 --> 03:34.540
you haven't gotten any 
qualification certificates?

03:34.540 --> 03:37.540
Not only a qualification certificate,

03:37.550 --> 03:40.040
I don't even have the 
qualification to get out of here.

03:40.050 --> 03:43.040
They said I ran a business to
defraud people out of money.

03:43.050 --> 03:47.390
When I think of the people who
suffered because of me...

03:47.390 --> 03:52.550
Even after I serve my sentence, 
I'll still be in prison, right?

03:52.560 --> 03:53.720
This...

03:53.730 --> 03:54.720
Is it for your image?

03:54.730 --> 03:56.720
How could it be?

03:56.730 --> 03:59.220
People who have tried those tricks,

03:59.230 --> 04:02.400
how will they face their God?

04:06.480 --> 04:07.910
-=Judo athlete loses eyesight=-

04:07.910 --> 04:08.670
Go Du Yeong?

04:08.670 --> 04:10.240
Go Du Yeong?

04:10.250 --> 04:11.580
But,

04:11.580 --> 04:12.740
what is this?

04:12.750 --> 04:15.580
This child,

04:15.580 --> 04:17.920
is my younger brother.

04:17.920 --> 04:20.420
Because I'm so useless, I 
never dared to mention it.

04:20.420 --> 04:22.750
I didn't want to hurt my 
brother's reputation.

04:22.760 --> 04:25.090
My parents passed away on
the same night.

04:25.090 --> 04:29.090
Now my only brother has gone
blind...

04:30.930 --> 04:34.420
I'm a terrible person.

04:34.440 --> 04:37.770
I would gladly accept my 
punishment, but...

04:39.440 --> 04:42.770
just thinking about this child, 
I can't even swallow my food.

04:42.780 --> 04:46.110
All my brother can see must be
endless darkness.

04:46.110 --> 04:48.950
I don't even know if he is 
eating on time.

04:48.950 --> 04:51.940
That he's not sick!

04:51.950 --> 04:55.620
The reason I applied for release 
on parole

04:55.620 --> 04:59.290
is totally because of this child.

04:59.290 --> 05:01.460
Yes.

05:05.470 --> 05:08.960
I'll take this back.

05:16.310 --> 05:19.140
I can't stop crying.

05:40.170 --> 05:43.660
Go Du Yeong actually put a
glimmer of light into my life.

06:05.530 --> 06:07.190
That hurts.

06:11.030 --> 06:12.690
The first time I've been back 
here in 10 years.

06:12.700 --> 06:15.360
Why should I have to climb
over a wall?

06:31.720 --> 06:33.710
It's filthy.

06:47.900 --> 06:49.890
It's like a haunted house.

06:58.580 --> 07:00.410
Oh, it stinks.

07:09.260 --> 07:11.750
Are you some little kid?

07:13.760 --> 07:17.600
You won't even get up to 
open the front door.

07:18.770 --> 07:20.600
Ah, that's right.

07:20.600 --> 07:22.760
You're disabled, aren't you?

07:28.280 --> 07:29.780
Get out.

07:29.780 --> 07:31.770
I don't want to.

07:42.120 --> 07:43.950
I haven't seen you in a long time.

07:43.960 --> 07:45.450
Get lost.

07:56.470 --> 07:58.630
It's done.

07:58.640 --> 08:02.300
I finally get to eat ramen in 
my own house!

08:17.160 --> 08:19.820
I didn't expect you to be such
a help in my life.

08:19.830 --> 08:22.660
Thanks, brat.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.840
Before you get the call, you 
should know it's only for one year.

08:29.840 --> 08:32.000
I didn't come here willingly, 
either.

08:32.010 --> 08:36.000
It's just one year we have to
live together.

08:36.010 --> 08:40.850
After that, I promise I'll 
disappear without a trace.

08:45.690 --> 08:48.350
<i>You rude jerk.</i>

08:48.360 --> 08:52.520
If a hyena comes into your 
home, you should at least 
come out to check.

08:57.030 --> 08:59.690
But I wonder...

08:59.700 --> 09:03.870
how much is this place worth
now?

09:03.870 --> 09:05.030
It should be a lot.

09:05.040 --> 09:07.200
How much money do you have?

09:07.210 --> 09:08.370
Hey!

09:08.380 --> 09:11.370
Your mom must have left you 
something before she died.

09:11.380 --> 09:14.040
<i>By the way, don't expect
anything.</i>

09:14.050 --> 09:17.210
<i>Don't think I'm here to take
really good care of you!</i>

09:17.220 --> 09:19.380
<i>If you're having naive thoughts
like that,</i>

09:19.390 --> 09:22.720
<i>you should get rid of them as
soon as possible.</i>

10:05.100 --> 10:07.090
What was that?

10:14.780 --> 10:15.770
Hey.

10:15.780 --> 10:17.770
Let go!

10:19.950 --> 10:23.610
If you can't get from the kitchen
to your room, what's the point?

10:23.620 --> 10:28.110
I'll go to my room and you can 
do whatever you want.

10:54.650 --> 10:56.980
Give me one pack Lamborghini 
Ice Tornado.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.820
What?

10:58.820 --> 11:00.650
Lamborghini Ice Tor... Tor... 
That.

11:00.660 --> 11:01.640
Ajussi.

11:01.660 --> 11:04.150
One box Lamborghini menthol,
please.

11:04.160 --> 11:06.820
Ah, menthol.

11:06.830 --> 11:09.160
That's what I just said.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.170
Give me another one of those.

11:15.170 --> 11:17.160
They're sold out.

11:19.510 --> 11:21.170
Then that means...

11:21.180 --> 11:23.170
you should put it down.

11:23.180 --> 11:25.170
I already paid for it.

11:25.180 --> 11:26.670
Lamborghini menthol.

11:26.680 --> 11:28.840
I asked for it by its correct 
name,

11:28.850 --> 11:33.340
Lamborghini Ice Tornado, okay?

11:37.690 --> 11:39.350
Ajussi.

11:39.360 --> 11:41.020
Keep the change!

11:41.030 --> 11:42.520
Hey. Hey!

11:42.530 --> 11:43.860
Hey!

11:43.870 --> 11:45.860
Hey, you fucking bastard!

11:45.870 --> 11:47.700
- Give it to me. 
- Okay, okay.

11:47.700 --> 11:49.200
I'll give it to you. I'll give it 
to you.

11:51.710 --> 11:53.210
This bastard wants to die.

11:53.210 --> 11:54.700
Hey, you bastard.

11:54.710 --> 11:58.540
The next time we meet is the
day you die!

11:58.550 --> 12:00.710
Son of a bitch.

12:01.720 --> 12:02.880
Now my stomach hurts.

12:02.880 --> 12:04.220
What the hell?

12:04.220 --> 12:05.210
Why now?

12:05.220 --> 12:07.380
Damn, I really have to go.

12:07.390 --> 12:08.220
You're an asshole!

12:08.220 --> 12:11.220
You're just lucky I have to shit!

12:17.230 --> 12:19.720
Du Yeong, it's me. Su Hyun.

12:19.730 --> 12:22.730
Why don't you ever answer 
the phone?

12:24.070 --> 12:27.060
I'm at your front door right now.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.570
Are you at home...

12:32.250 --> 12:34.740
It opened.

12:36.250 --> 12:37.910
That hurts.

12:44.090 --> 12:46.750
Du Yeong.

12:53.600 --> 12:55.760
<i>Du Yeong.</i>

13:35.980 --> 13:36.970
Wh-Wh-Who are you?

13:36.980 --> 13:38.970
Who? Why did you hit me?

13:38.980 --> 13:41.810
What the heck?

13:41.820 --> 13:45.310
So what is your relationship?
Are you his girlfriend?

13:45.320 --> 13:47.310
It looks like Du Yeong won't
eat anything.

13:47.320 --> 13:48.650
He'll eat when he gets hungry.

13:48.660 --> 13:52.150
He's not a child.

13:52.160 --> 13:53.650
Don't talk about him like that!

13:53.660 --> 13:57.830
Why are you shouting at me,
woman?

14:01.340 --> 14:02.830
Du Yeong, let's eat.

14:02.840 --> 14:05.000
What is that woman doing?

14:05.010 --> 14:05.840
<i>Du Yeong.</i>

14:05.840 --> 14:08.000
<i>Du Yeong, get up. Let's eat...</i>

14:08.010 --> 14:10.340
<i>Du Yeong, what's wrong?</i>

14:10.350 --> 14:13.180
<i>Du Yeong, open your eyes!</i>

14:18.690 --> 14:20.520
Listen carefully.

14:20.520 --> 14:23.350
I didn't come here to pay my 
last respects to you.

14:23.360 --> 14:24.850
Don't make a big fuss.

14:24.860 --> 14:28.350
If you really want to die, 
then die quietly.

14:28.360 --> 14:31.360
Otherwise, eat and stay alive.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.050
He said it's malnutrition.

14:49.050 --> 14:52.880
Does malnutrition make any 
sense?

14:52.890 --> 14:54.720
Do you think it only takes 
ability to be a national athlete?

14:54.720 --> 14:56.220
A national athlete also needs
stamina.

14:56.220 --> 14:58.560
Shouldn't you at least pay
attention whether he eats or not?

14:58.560 --> 15:00.550
Then take him away.

15:00.560 --> 15:02.720
Since you're so worried, 
just take him.

15:02.730 --> 15:05.560
As his "coach", does it really 
matter if he's blind or not?

15:05.570 --> 15:06.560
What do you mean by that?

15:06.570 --> 15:08.900
You said he has the stamina of 
a national athlete.

15:08.900 --> 15:11.060
That should do well.

15:11.070 --> 15:13.400
Are you trash?

15:19.750 --> 15:22.240
Because of that damn kid, my 
life really has become a pile 
of trash.

15:22.250 --> 15:24.740
- Fucking seriously.
- Fucking seriously?

15:24.750 --> 15:25.910
For patient Go Du Yeong,

15:25.920 --> 15:28.080
please go take care of the bill.

15:30.930 --> 15:34.920
The trash will leave first.

15:34.930 --> 15:35.760
My card is maxed out...

15:35.760 --> 15:39.600
I'm someone who doesn't even
have a card, understand?

15:39.600 --> 15:42.930
Thinking about a card makes
me crazy, okay?

15:43.940 --> 15:47.100
What kind of a bastard...

15:47.110 --> 15:49.440
<i>What kind of brother is that?</i>

15:49.440 --> 15:51.440
He doesn't have to be so rude.

15:51.450 --> 15:54.440
No one could even tell that
he's your brother.

15:54.450 --> 15:56.780
He's not my real brother.

15:58.620 --> 16:00.280
No wonder.

16:00.290 --> 16:03.450
That makes more sense.

16:03.620 --> 16:06.960
Should I beat you? Huh?

16:06.960 --> 16:09.290
Turning a good person into 
trash, is that fun?

16:09.300 --> 16:10.790
Stop the show.

16:10.800 --> 16:13.460
When it's time to eat, come in 
obediently and eat.

16:13.470 --> 16:15.960
Stop pissing me off.

16:22.810 --> 16:25.300
Is it fried ham?

16:35.660 --> 16:37.320
It's Spam.

16:38.660 --> 16:40.650
This jerk is too much.

even your nose is broken?

Ramen is rice now?

Are you disrespecting ramen?

So many varieties, you 
dumb ass.

17:10.859 --> 17:12.190
What about you?

17:12.190 --> 17:15.530
You grew up eating well, so it 
won't hurt you to eat this for 
10 more years.

17:15.530 --> 17:18.020
So just shut up and eat.

17:18.200 --> 17:21.030
Don't tell me what to eat.

You son of a bitch, that's not
how you talk to your brother.

17:33.550 --> 17:35.040
Then calling me "son of a bitch"
is okay?

Ow.

Your mouth...

17:40.220 --> 17:41.710
I guess it still works, huh?

17:41.720 --> 17:44.710
It would be nice if that didn't
work, either.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.730
You ruined my appetite.

You can see a little bit, right?
You son of a bitch.

What, asshole?

18:26.100 --> 18:28.760
What? What? Asshole.

Son of a bitch.

18:44.450 --> 18:48.790
If there's a problem, you must
bring your brother's power of 
attorney form.

18:48.790 --> 18:51.620
I need to have a power of 
attorney?

18:51.630 --> 18:53.620
I'm sorry.

18:53.630 --> 18:56.290
I mean, I'm his brother.
His older brother.

18:56.300 --> 18:59.130
We're family...

18:59.130 --> 19:01.120
Seriously.

19:11.810 --> 19:14.140
Oh, squid strips.

19:14.150 --> 19:15.140
Ajussi.

19:15.150 --> 19:16.310
Are you out of Coke Zero?

19:16.320 --> 19:19.150
Oh, here it is.

19:19.150 --> 19:21.140
This much, right?

19:22.820 --> 19:23.810
Add this on.

19:23.820 --> 19:25.820
Where did my cola go?

19:28.330 --> 19:29.820
Damn it!

19:29.830 --> 19:32.320
Hey, hey, hey!

19:32.330 --> 19:33.990
You're back. You're back. 
I warned you last time, didn't I?

19:34.000 --> 19:35.830
The next time I saw you 
would...

19:35.840 --> 19:37.830
would be your death day, so...

19:37.840 --> 19:41.000
That was my cola first, see?

19:41.010 --> 19:42.670
So, well...

19:42.680 --> 19:45.010
You live in this neighborhood?

19:46.010 --> 19:46.840
What if I do?

19:46.850 --> 19:48.180
Then...

19:48.180 --> 19:52.020
Let's make a rule.

19:52.020 --> 19:55.510
Whoever pays for it, gets it.
Okay?

19:55.520 --> 19:59.360
What kind of work do you do?

19:59.360 --> 20:02.190
Why do you need to know?

20:02.200 --> 20:05.860
What do you think I do?

20:05.870 --> 20:08.360
I-I didn't ask.

20:08.370 --> 20:09.700
I'm not interested.

20:09.700 --> 20:10.690
What are you talking about?

20:10.710 --> 20:12.540
That means go figure it out
yourself,

20:12.540 --> 20:14.030
old man.

20:14.040 --> 20:16.030
Give me my cola!

20:16.040 --> 20:17.540
Omo. What to do?

20:17.550 --> 20:20.210
I'm sorry. Your suit. Aigoo.

20:20.210 --> 20:21.370
It's time to light the incense.
[funeral ceremony]

20:21.380 --> 20:22.540
Light the incense!

20:22.550 --> 20:24.380
Don't be like this!

20:24.390 --> 20:25.550
Don't chase me! Don't chase me!

20:25.550 --> 20:27.380
You're the neighborhood 
nutjob!

20:27.390 --> 20:31.050
The next time I see you, you
asshole, your mother will be 
burning incense!

20:31.060 --> 20:33.890
Nothing goes smoothly.

20:35.560 --> 20:37.720
What's with those pants?

20:37.730 --> 20:39.390
It's getting mushy. It's mushy
already.

20:39.400 --> 20:42.230
Eat it. Okay.

20:42.240 --> 20:43.230
You...

20:43.240 --> 20:44.740
It smells like sweet and sour 
pork, right?

20:44.740 --> 20:46.230
Sweet and sour pork. Here.

20:46.240 --> 20:48.570
Have a bite. Open up.

20:48.580 --> 20:49.410
What are you doing?

20:49.410 --> 20:51.070
What do you think?

20:51.080 --> 20:52.740
I'm watching you waste away.

20:52.750 --> 20:56.910
It really makes me feel bad.

20:58.420 --> 21:00.080
A fork would be better, right?

21:00.090 --> 21:01.750
Wait a second.

21:05.260 --> 21:06.760
Okay, here's a fork.

21:06.760 --> 21:08.920
Here's a fork. Here's a fork.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.260
Here. Say "ah".

21:23.280 --> 21:25.270
Then you feed yourself.

21:25.280 --> 21:27.270
You can do that.

21:28.450 --> 21:30.610
Here, it's in front of you.

21:32.950 --> 21:36.290
That's a carrot.

21:36.290 --> 21:37.790
That's cucumber. Cucumber.

21:37.790 --> 21:39.950
Cucumber.

21:39.960 --> 21:40.790
Left. Left.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.290
I'm not eating.

21:53.970 --> 21:55.480
I'll just stab it for you.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.470
Eat.

22:03.820 --> 22:07.980
It's good. It's good, right?

22:07.990 --> 22:09.820
It must be good!

22:09.820 --> 22:11.160
I told you so.

22:11.160 --> 22:13.650
Okay! How about the black
bean noodles?

22:13.660 --> 22:15.490
It's starting to get mushy.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.490
You know you have to eat it 
before it gets too mushy.

22:17.500 --> 22:19.490
Here, dig in.

22:30.010 --> 22:33.340
Wow! You eat well, little
brother!

22:33.350 --> 22:36.180
You can really eat.

22:36.180 --> 22:38.520
This is from Yangjagang, right?

22:38.520 --> 22:41.680
Yangjagang?

22:41.690 --> 22:43.350
Are you a ghost?
[how did you know?]

22:43.360 --> 22:44.520
You are a ghost.

22:44.530 --> 22:48.190
Wow, you're really amazing.

22:48.200 --> 22:50.860
By the way...

22:52.530 --> 22:55.700
Our father and your mom,

22:55.700 --> 23:00.040
that columbarium said they
want to move their ashes.

23:00.040 --> 23:02.370
Because of that...

23:02.380 --> 23:03.710
we need to submit some 
documents.

23:03.710 --> 23:06.040
I can't sign by myself, since
you're also their child.

23:06.050 --> 23:07.210
So I need a...

23:07.210 --> 23:08.040
is it power of attorney?

23:08.050 --> 23:11.040
They said I need to bring that.

23:11.050 --> 23:12.710
Anyway, it's a big hassle.

23:12.720 --> 23:14.550
I guess just to do something
so small,

23:14.560 --> 23:17.220
the procedures are still very
complicated.

23:17.220 --> 23:19.220
So?

23:21.230 --> 23:24.060
Where is your seal?

23:24.060 --> 23:28.230
Why does the columbarium need 
my seal to move their ashes?

23:29.570 --> 23:31.900
What do you mean, you 
bastard?

23:31.910 --> 23:32.900
Looking at your reaction just now,

23:32.910 --> 23:37.570
you must think I'm going to
do something dishonest, 
is that it?

23:37.580 --> 23:41.410
Wow, I'm really disappointed!
Seriously.

23:41.420 --> 23:42.750
Wow.

23:42.750 --> 23:43.580
Hey...

23:43.580 --> 23:47.420
No matter what you think, why
would I use your seal like that?

23:47.420 --> 23:49.250
Just forget it then!

23:49.260 --> 23:50.760
We'll just let them take those
two old people's ashes,

23:50.760 --> 23:55.250
and sprinkle them in the 
Yangjaecheon stream.

23:55.260 --> 23:57.250
What I said,

23:57.260 --> 24:00.260
I didn't mean it like that.

24:07.610 --> 24:09.770
Please confirm it.

24:12.280 --> 24:15.110
It's perfect.

24:16.120 --> 24:17.280
Thank you.

24:17.280 --> 24:19.280
You've worked hard.

24:21.620 --> 24:25.110
It's under 3000 cc, so it has 
the best fuel economy.

24:25.130 --> 24:27.120
Take a look.

24:27.130 --> 24:29.290
This opens!

24:29.300 --> 24:32.290
This, there's this. It should be
able to open, right?

24:32.300 --> 24:33.630
First time in a car like this?

24:33.630 --> 24:38.130
So for this one, how much is it?

24:38.140 --> 24:40.130
Just a moment.

24:42.310 --> 24:44.140
You give a discount for the
disabled, right?

24:44.140 --> 24:46.140
What?

24:48.820 --> 24:51.980
Try it. A macaroon.

24:58.490 --> 25:00.650
Guess where I bought them.

25:00.660 --> 25:03.150
Icheon-dong.

25:03.160 --> 25:04.990
They're good, right?

25:05.000 --> 25:07.830
Those are your favorites.

25:10.170 --> 25:12.660
Du Yeong.

25:12.670 --> 25:15.670
Judo... keep practicing.

25:15.680 --> 25:18.510
I can't see anything, so how 
can I practice judo?

25:18.510 --> 25:20.010
Don't misunderstand and just
listen to me first.

25:20.010 --> 25:22.350
I've been checking into...

25:22.350 --> 25:25.340
the Paralympic national team.

25:31.690 --> 25:33.020
If you get selected,

25:33.030 --> 25:35.520
you will be able to...

25:37.360 --> 25:40.530
I've lived in this house for 
20 years,

25:40.530 --> 25:43.200
but I can't even find my 
own room.

25:43.200 --> 25:46.700
You want me to keep practicing
judo?

25:46.710 --> 25:50.040
What do you think that's called?

25:52.050 --> 25:54.710
That's called disability 
overconfidence.

26:39.930 --> 26:42.420
My temple.

26:46.600 --> 26:50.430
<i>No, no. You can't drink that.</i>

26:50.440 --> 26:52.100
The best kind of beauty

26:52.110 --> 26:54.770
is dumb beauty.

27:01.280 --> 27:02.110
Your shoes are loud.

27:02.120 --> 27:03.950
Oppa...

27:03.950 --> 27:07.440
this is your house?

27:07.450 --> 27:08.790
You're so cute, so cute.

27:08.790 --> 27:10.950
Our house has a mad dog.

27:10.960 --> 27:12.290
It will be noisy if you wake it.

27:12.290 --> 27:14.620
Just take my hand quietly.

27:14.630 --> 27:17.120
Talk softly.

27:22.800 --> 27:25.290
This way, this way.

27:27.640 --> 27:30.300
Oppa! A ghost, a ghost!

27:30.310 --> 27:32.640
You're sitting here?

27:32.650 --> 27:33.640
Oppa.

27:33.650 --> 27:35.980
The mad dog is a man?

27:35.980 --> 27:37.640
A mad dog?

27:37.650 --> 27:39.310
I meant that...

27:39.320 --> 27:40.820
No.

27:40.820 --> 27:42.310
It's not like that.

27:42.320 --> 27:46.160
Before this mad dog bites you,
you'd better get out of here.

27:46.160 --> 27:48.150
This kid, talking to your 
brother like that.

27:48.160 --> 27:49.150
Who do you think...

27:49.160 --> 27:52.330
Hey, hey, hey.

27:52.330 --> 27:54.160
Where are you going? Cutie!

27:54.170 --> 27:55.500
Hey, Baby!

27:59.510 --> 28:01.500
Bastard.

28:01.510 --> 28:05.170
People should have at least
some common sense.

28:05.180 --> 28:09.340
If you have common sense, you
don't need education, money or
whatever. Fuck.

28:09.350 --> 28:12.180
Just because you're fucking
disabled, I'm screwed.

28:12.190 --> 28:14.350
I was trying to be a good
example for you, you fucker.

28:14.350 --> 28:18.350
Then you turn on me like that?
So damn annoying.

28:18.860 --> 28:20.190
Gui-dong Community Center.

28:20.190 --> 28:22.030
Who are you talking to?

28:22.030 --> 28:25.190
Yes, hello. You came to my
house the other day.

28:25.200 --> 28:26.360
This is Go Du Yeong.

28:26.370 --> 28:29.860
You asked me if I would be 
interested in rehabilitation.

28:29.870 --> 28:30.860
I've been thinking about it.

28:30.870 --> 28:33.860
Compared to how I am now, it
would probably be good for me.

28:33.870 --> 28:36.710
I'm curious about something.

28:36.710 --> 28:38.870
If a criminal was given parole
just to take care of me,

28:38.880 --> 28:41.540
will he be sent back to prison?

28:41.550 --> 28:43.710
He doesn't help me at all.

28:43.720 --> 28:44.710
You crazy bastard.

28:44.720 --> 28:46.050
Are you an insane asshole?

28:46.050 --> 28:48.540
You're driving me crazy!

28:48.560 --> 28:50.890
I was doing fine without you.

28:50.890 --> 28:53.220
Please get the hell out.

29:01.900 --> 29:04.060
That jerk just had a temper
tantrum.

29:08.080 --> 29:10.410
Hello?

29:12.080 --> 29:14.240
Du Yeong is wasting his ability.

29:14.250 --> 29:17.740
In the Paralympics, at least he 
would still be involved in sports.

29:17.750 --> 29:19.940
As his brother, explain that
to him.

29:21.260 --> 29:23.590
He said he doesn't want to, 
so why should I?

29:23.590 --> 29:26.580
That's why you need to 
persuade him!

29:26.590 --> 29:28.930
You live together, so keep 
encouraging him.

29:28.930 --> 29:31.260
I don't have that much free time.

29:31.270 --> 29:33.600
You must be a gangster.

29:33.600 --> 29:36.090
What?

29:36.100 --> 29:38.260
As his brother, your car is 
pretty fancy.

29:38.270 --> 29:39.760
Where did you get the money
to buy it?

29:39.770 --> 29:41.270
You even put Du Yeong's 
disabled person sticker on it.

29:41.280 --> 29:44.440
Someone who's so busy has 
time to take care of all of that?

29:47.610 --> 29:49.120
I think you're interested in me.

29:49.120 --> 29:50.450
I don't care about sports.

29:50.450 --> 29:51.110
Are you out of your mind?

29:51.120 --> 29:53.110
Then why don't you mind your
own business?

29:53.120 --> 29:55.280
He's so scared, he doesn't dare
step outside.

29:55.290 --> 29:58.120
You're not his full brother, 
but this is still outrageous.

29:58.130 --> 29:59.290
You're still his older brother.

29:59.290 --> 30:00.120
As an older brother, you...

30:00.130 --> 30:03.120
If you're giving out advice, 
I have something else to do.

30:03.130 --> 30:05.460
There are plenty of families who
get along without blood ties.

30:05.470 --> 30:07.960
Family members, my ass.

30:11.470 --> 30:14.460
Maybe that child was bored, 
so he played a little joke.

30:14.470 --> 30:15.810
No matter how well I treat him,

30:15.810 --> 30:19.800
I can't erase the psychological
trauma he suffered.

30:19.810 --> 30:23.310
Go Du Yeong, are you eating
properly?

30:23.320 --> 30:24.650
Shin Ramyeon.

30:24.650 --> 30:26.810
Neoguri.

30:26.820 --> 30:27.810
Nagasaki.

30:28.820 --> 30:31.990
When he was alone, he couldn't
even cook ramen.

30:31.990 --> 30:34.830
I saw him breaking up and 
eating the dry noodles.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.660
He begged me to cook every 
brand for him. Here's a drink.

30:39.670 --> 30:42.330
If you have difficulty with meals, 
you can apply for assistance.

30:42.340 --> 30:45.170
We can provide kimchi and 
other side dishes for support.

30:45.170 --> 30:47.160
You're doing good work.

30:47.170 --> 30:48.330
Your younger brother,

30:48.340 --> 30:52.180
because of the change in his 
situation may possibly develop
depression.

30:53.180 --> 30:54.670
With you by his side,

30:54.680 --> 30:57.510
it would be good for you to 
accompany him on walks.

30:57.520 --> 31:00.180
Enjoy being in the sunshine.

31:02.190 --> 31:03.850
I'm going in.

31:03.860 --> 31:06.020
Sit out here in the sun, kid.

31:06.030 --> 31:07.360
She said you have depression.

31:07.360 --> 31:09.520
I'm depressed because of you.

31:09.530 --> 31:11.860
And you really piss me off too!

31:11.870 --> 31:14.700
Prison or family, it's all the 
same. Fuck it.

31:35.890 --> 31:37.720
Don't you have...

31:37.720 --> 31:39.560
anyplace you want to go?

31:39.560 --> 31:42.050
Didn't you say the columbarium 
moved?

31:43.060 --> 31:45.730
I want to go there.

31:48.740 --> 31:51.400
You want to go there with me?

31:51.410 --> 31:53.570
You and me?

31:53.570 --> 31:56.060
We're so close, right?

31:56.080 --> 31:57.740
Those genes were heartless.

31:57.740 --> 31:59.740
You're fine. Your mother was
also fine.

31:59.750 --> 32:02.410
If you don't want to, then forget
it. Stop bitching about it.

32:02.420 --> 32:05.910
Shut up, asshole.

32:26.610 --> 32:29.440
Do you remember?

32:29.440 --> 32:31.600
The Jongsu public baths.

32:31.610 --> 32:34.100
In Yangjagang?

32:34.110 --> 32:37.110
When dad got paid,

32:37.120 --> 32:39.450
mom and dad,

32:39.450 --> 32:41.610
you and me,

32:41.620 --> 32:43.450
would bathe there.

32:43.460 --> 32:45.120
Then we'd eat black bean 
noodles.

32:45.130 --> 32:47.620
I don't remember.

32:47.630 --> 32:51.620
After you left, we never went
again.

32:51.630 --> 32:53.960
When I kept pestering him to go,

32:53.970 --> 32:56.300
<i>he said we had to wait until 
you came back.</i>

32:56.300 --> 32:58.290
What are you talking about?

32:58.310 --> 33:03.470
You think we all lived happily
after you left, don't you?

33:03.480 --> 33:07.640
Maybe it was because you
were an adolescent.

33:07.650 --> 33:11.480
Maybe you wanted to be a 
success before you came back.

33:11.490 --> 33:14.820
I dreamed up every kind of 
excuse to understand you.

33:14.820 --> 33:18.310
But you still never came back.

33:19.990 --> 33:24.990
At 18 years old, I had to handle
my parents' funeral all alone.

33:26.330 --> 33:29.830
<i>That's when I gave up.</i>

33:29.840 --> 33:33.330
<i>Our relationship was really over.</i>

33:46.190 --> 33:49.520
I won't report you to the prison, 
so don't worry.

33:49.520 --> 33:51.860
You can leave easily.

33:51.860 --> 33:54.520
By now, I can take care of 
myself.

34:10.210 --> 34:12.540
Get up.

34:12.550 --> 34:14.540
Hey, get up.

34:17.219 --> 34:19.550
I said get up, you jerk.

34:19.550 --> 34:20.540
What are you doing?

34:20.550 --> 34:22.389
Get up.

34:22.389 --> 34:24.350
- Come on, up.
- Quit!

34:24.560 --> 34:25.889
Get up now.

34:25.889 --> 34:27.550
This damn kid.

34:27.560 --> 34:30.050
Do as you're told. Get up.

34:30.060 --> 34:32.050
Get up.

34:32.070 --> 34:33.230
Damn it!

34:33.230 --> 34:35.560
I was going to take you to the
sauna, you jerk.

34:35.570 --> 34:36.560
To wash...

34:36.570 --> 34:39.570
Soak for a while, kid.

34:41.070 --> 34:47.070
Go Du Yeong's layer of dead 
skin from the past 10 years 
must be unbelievable.

34:48.250 --> 34:49.580
No.

34:49.580 --> 34:51.239
I want to go back home.

34:51.250 --> 34:53.909
You said you wanted to come.

34:53.920 --> 34:56.250
Since we're here, just get 
a scrub.

34:56.260 --> 34:58.250
Hurry and undress.

35:10.940 --> 35:12.100
You grew up pretty well.

35:12.110 --> 35:13.770
What are you doing?

35:14.440 --> 35:15.770
Crazy jerk.

35:15.780 --> 35:18.610
You really do see a little,
you asshole.

35:18.610 --> 35:22.100
It's obvious you can see.

35:22.120 --> 35:25.610
Wow, that jerk.

35:28.460 --> 35:30.450
Wow, look at all this dead skin!

35:30.460 --> 35:32.450
It will probably clog the drain.

35:32.460 --> 35:34.450
Just be quiet and scrub.

35:34.460 --> 35:36.450
This is cool, right?

35:36.460 --> 35:39.300
Can't you tell I'm an expert?

35:39.300 --> 35:42.460
Did you just eat and scrub 
backs?

35:42.470 --> 35:43.960
Kid,

35:43.970 --> 35:45.470
before I went to prison,

35:45.470 --> 35:47.630
I hid inside a public bath for 
a year.

35:47.640 --> 35:50.970
I helped scrub people's backs
for a whole year.

35:50.980 --> 35:54.810
That's how a jerk who ran away
from home was able to live.

35:54.810 --> 35:57.810
I was a waiter, porter, even a
beauty salon assistant,

35:57.820 --> 35:59.810
just to get a mouthful of food.

36:02.990 --> 36:05.980
Then why did you run away 
from home?

36:08.330 --> 36:11.320
Your brain is useless if you
don't understand.

36:11.330 --> 36:14.490
My mom and you didn't get
along, right?

36:17.840 --> 36:20.170
Your mom treated me very well.

36:20.170 --> 36:22.660
After your mother walked in
the door,

36:22.680 --> 36:24.670
I had the best lunch in my 
whole class.

36:24.680 --> 36:26.510
At lunch time,

36:26.510 --> 36:29.000
the moms would arrive with
udong noodles.

36:29.020 --> 36:31.680
your mom was usually first.

36:31.690 --> 36:33.850
I still remember what she 
sent me.

36:33.850 --> 36:36.010
But,

36:36.020 --> 36:39.190
one day the ajumma who 
lived next door

36:39.190 --> 36:41.180
came over and talked to me.

36:41.190 --> 36:43.360
She woke me up.

36:43.360 --> 36:45.700
She said how could I be so
stupid?

36:45.700 --> 36:47.690
Why?

36:50.200 --> 36:52.870
Why?

36:52.870 --> 36:55.710
She said, "That woman that 
you call mother. That woman..."

36:55.710 --> 36:58.370
"is the woman who nursed your
mom before she died."

36:58.380 --> 37:00.210
She said if my mom looked 
down from heaven,

37:00.210 --> 37:02.040
she would probably feel she
died unfairly and hate me.

37:02.050 --> 37:04.710
So, I got fucking angry and 
ran away, why?

37:04.720 --> 37:08.710
The two of them had been 
praying for my mother's early 
death.

37:08.720 --> 37:12.390
That's what I thought, kid.

37:12.390 --> 37:14.050
Why did you ask that?

37:14.060 --> 37:16.890
You pulled out my dark
secret.

37:24.570 --> 37:26.730
Scrub in a different place!

37:26.740 --> 37:29.400
It looks like I'm using an 
eraser on your back!

37:29.410 --> 37:33.400
No matter how much I scrub, 
the dead skin doesn't stop.

37:33.410 --> 37:34.740
I'm probably bleeding by now.

37:34.750 --> 37:36.080
Seriously, kid.

37:36.080 --> 37:37.580
My hands will bleed from
scrubbing you.

37:37.580 --> 37:39.920
There's so much.

37:41.760 --> 37:44.420
What's this back?

37:44.420 --> 37:48.090
How did it get so broad? 
You used to be a little shrimp.

37:48.090 --> 37:50.430
That "pepper" didn't have a
single hair.
[penis]

37:50.430 --> 37:54.420
Now it's already filled in 
thick and black.

37:56.770 --> 37:58.600
No good.

37:58.610 --> 38:00.270
Let's go.

38:00.270 --> 38:01.260
I have plenty.

38:01.270 --> 38:03.270
You have a lot of sportswear.

38:03.280 --> 38:05.940
A man's clothing is important,
kid.

38:08.950 --> 38:09.940
Du Yeong.

38:09.950 --> 38:11.280
Are you okay?

38:11.280 --> 38:14.120
He shouldn't be standing in
the road.

38:14.120 --> 38:18.110
Wait, wait, wait.

38:18.120 --> 38:19.960
What are you doing?

38:19.960 --> 38:21.460
What?

38:21.460 --> 38:22.120
Me?

38:22.130 --> 38:24.290
Yes, you.

38:24.300 --> 38:26.130
It's obvious. I'm shopping.

38:26.130 --> 38:28.120
Who do you think you are?

38:28.130 --> 38:31.470
If you knock over a blind person, 
shouldn't you apologize?

38:34.640 --> 38:35.630
Blind person?

38:35.640 --> 38:37.970
If he's blind, where's his 
walking stick?

38:37.980 --> 38:39.970
Why does he go out without a
stick just to cause problems?

38:39.980 --> 38:42.640
I mean, when you come across
a disabled person, just be kind.

38:42.650 --> 38:44.140
Shouldn't you have that 
basic humanity?

38:44.150 --> 38:46.810
That's really annoying.

38:48.660 --> 38:50.150
This jerk.

38:50.160 --> 38:51.150
So young.

38:51.160 --> 38:52.660
Young, my ass.

38:52.660 --> 38:56.650
I'm older than your girlfriend,
old man.

38:56.660 --> 38:58.150
Who do you think you are?

38:58.160 --> 39:00.330
Why are you hanging around
with a blind kid?

39:00.330 --> 39:03.000
I'm his older brother. 
What about it?

39:03.000 --> 39:03.830
Let's just go.

39:03.840 --> 39:05.170
Stay right there.

39:06.340 --> 39:10.000
Somebody disabled shouldn't
pretend to be normal.

39:10.010 --> 39:11.170
Hold on.

39:11.180 --> 39:12.840
What...?

39:12.850 --> 39:14.340
What did you say about 
"disabled"?

39:14.350 --> 39:15.510
If he can't see,

39:15.520 --> 39:17.850
he should go stand alone in a
corner.

39:17.850 --> 39:19.680
If you have eyes,

39:19.690 --> 39:21.180
watch out for people when
you're walking.

39:21.190 --> 39:22.850
Don't tell me your eyes...

39:22.860 --> 39:26.020
are only used to look at 
young girls?

39:29.200 --> 39:30.180
I told you to apologize.

39:30.200 --> 39:33.690
After you pay for your things, 
then apologize to my brother,

39:33.700 --> 39:35.030
old man.

39:35.030 --> 39:37.370
You fucker.

39:39.710 --> 39:41.700
Customer!

39:41.710 --> 39:43.370
Don't fight.

39:43.380 --> 39:44.880
<i>I barely touched him.</i>

39:44.880 --> 39:46.870
You all planned this, didn't you?

39:46.880 --> 39:47.540
What's going on?

39:47.550 --> 39:49.710
I just barely touched him.

39:49.720 --> 39:50.710
He seems seriously hurt.

39:50.720 --> 39:52.550
<i>I told you to let it go.</i>

39:52.550 --> 39:54.210
<i>He's all in a cold sweat.</i>

39:54.220 --> 39:55.720
<i>What to do?</i>

39:55.720 --> 39:57.880
Wait a second. Oh, my stomach...

39:57.890 --> 39:59.550
Are you all right?

40:02.900 --> 40:05.060
I really didn't mean to!

40:05.060 --> 40:06.570
It's just that he was...

40:06.570 --> 40:08.560
I just barely touched him!

40:08.570 --> 40:11.400
It really was his fault, making 
a scene about nothing!

40:11.400 --> 40:13.240
Please lower your voice.

40:13.240 --> 40:14.570
You should understand the
reason.

40:14.570 --> 40:16.410
That's his brother.

40:16.410 --> 40:18.740
He's disabled...

40:18.750 --> 40:20.240
Look.

40:20.250 --> 40:21.910
He has a physical disability.

40:21.920 --> 40:24.080
It's all my fault.

40:24.080 --> 40:25.740
I wanted to buy my brother
some clothes,

40:25.750 --> 40:29.090
so I forced him to go out.

40:35.260 --> 40:38.590
I only...

40:38.600 --> 40:43.590
want him to succeed in a world
full of prejudice. That's why I
brought him out!

40:46.110 --> 40:48.940
Unfortunately, there's so much
discrimination...

40:51.950 --> 40:53.440
It's all my fault.

40:55.280 --> 40:57.610
I'm sorry.

40:57.620 --> 41:00.610
It's all because of me.

41:00.620 --> 41:02.450
It must really hurt.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.790
I'm over here, you idiot!

41:04.790 --> 41:07.950
You're worried about me at a
time like this, you idiot?

41:13.970 --> 41:15.630
Come here.

41:15.640 --> 41:16.970
Okay.

41:36.660 --> 41:38.490
Just see if I don't get that guy!

41:38.490 --> 41:39.820
He was lucky.

41:39.830 --> 41:40.490
What are you doing?

41:40.490 --> 41:42.830
What do you mean?

41:42.830 --> 41:44.820
Are you going to academy
classes?

41:44.830 --> 41:48.320
Your acting was really great.

41:48.330 --> 41:49.670
I was keeping up with you.

41:49.670 --> 41:51.500
You little bastard.

41:51.500 --> 41:53.670
What do you mean calling me,
"you"?

41:53.670 --> 41:57.510
Then what should I call you?

41:57.510 --> 41:59.340
Do you think you're Hong Gil
Dong?

41:59.350 --> 42:04.010
You have a brother, but you 
can't call him your brother?

42:04.020 --> 42:06.510
"Hyeong", what bullshit.

42:06.520 --> 42:08.510
Even a dog passing by would 
laugh.

42:10.860 --> 42:13.350
You used to call me "hyeong".

42:13.360 --> 42:15.520
- When did I? 
- You just did.

42:15.530 --> 42:16.690
No, I never called you that.

42:16.700 --> 42:18.030
You brat.

42:18.030 --> 42:19.860
This little bastard, who are 
you lying to?

42:19.870 --> 42:22.530
I'm an expert on lying, okay?

42:22.540 --> 42:23.700
Let's hurry and get home.

42:23.700 --> 42:25.190
Fine, then you lead the way. 
Hurry.

42:25.200 --> 42:27.540
You can take me home, kid.

42:27.540 --> 42:29.700
- You can't move a single step
without me, kid.
- Let go. Let go!

42:29.710 --> 42:30.700
Let go!

42:34.880 --> 42:37.870
You scared me. Seriously.

42:37.880 --> 42:40.220
Do you want to throw me 
down again?

42:43.060 --> 42:45.550
Here, hold on.

42:48.560 --> 42:51.220
Son of a bitch, it's just "hyeong".

42:55.400 --> 42:56.900
Should I get an MRI or 
something?

42:56.900 --> 42:58.730
A CT scan isn't very expensive.

42:58.740 --> 43:00.570
That's enough.

43:00.570 --> 43:02.230
But did you see it?

43:03.240 --> 43:05.400
That fucking guy was so 
infuriating!

43:05.410 --> 43:07.070
<i>Did you see the woman he was
with?</i>

43:07.080 --> 43:09.740
<i>She was really pretty! 
It's so irritating!</i>

43:12.090 --> 43:14.580
So in other words...

43:18.420 --> 43:20.420
Can you go back to your room?

43:20.430 --> 43:23.920
We have some things to 
discuss, Du Yeong and I.

43:28.770 --> 43:30.760
They even have tea to drink.

43:30.770 --> 43:32.760
They could go into his room
and chat.

43:32.770 --> 43:34.760
<i>It's fine.</i>

43:34.770 --> 43:37.610
Just go ahead and say it.

43:44.280 --> 43:45.110
Du Yeong.

43:45.120 --> 43:47.450
If it's about that, then stop.

43:47.450 --> 43:48.950
I won't do it.

43:48.960 --> 43:51.120
<i>Are you embarrassed? </i>

43:51.120 --> 43:53.290
A Paralympics medal,

43:53.290 --> 43:54.950
is it meaningless?

43:54.960 --> 43:57.950
I don't want to be seen as a
blind, disabled person.

43:57.960 --> 44:00.630
As a normal person, if I say 
this it may have no meaning.

44:00.630 --> 44:02.290
But some people say,

44:02.300 --> 44:04.790
disabilities aren't to be 
overcome.

44:04.800 --> 44:05.900
They're to be accepted.

44:05.900 --> 44:07.903
How can they be accepted?

44:09.480 --> 44:12.470
Overnight, the whole world left
me and I became a big joke.

44:12.480 --> 44:14.140
I know you are enduring an 
incredible limitation.

44:14.150 --> 44:15.480
But Du Yeong,

44:15.480 --> 44:18.470
there are people who can help
with your limitations.

44:18.480 --> 44:20.820
But if you feel humiliation,

44:20.820 --> 44:22.480
no one can help with that 
but you.

44:22.490 --> 44:26.150
Would you change places
with me?

44:29.330 --> 44:32.320
I have lost everything.

44:38.500 --> 44:41.170
If you had lost everything,

44:41.170 --> 44:45.170
you wouldn't be talking about
"limitations" and such.

44:46.010 --> 44:46.840
That's right, Du Yeong.

44:46.850 --> 44:51.680
- But this matter... 
- The kid says he doesn't
want to!

44:51.680 --> 44:53.850
Whatever it is, he has to do it
willingly.

44:53.850 --> 44:56.190
If you force him, what if he gets
injured?

44:56.190 --> 44:59.520
How much more damage do 
you want to do? Leave.

44:59.530 --> 45:02.690
Don't come back. Just go.

45:02.700 --> 45:04.530
Do you have the right to 
do this?

45:04.530 --> 45:06.860
You never even cared whether
Du Yeong ate or not.

45:06.870 --> 45:10.200
These days, who the hell 
has malnutrition?

45:11.540 --> 45:14.200
I want some barbecued pork.

45:19.380 --> 45:20.540
Is that so?

45:20.550 --> 45:22.540
Coach, you can eat before
you go.

45:23.880 --> 45:25.540
I...

45:25.550 --> 45:28.540
You might as well pick up
some chopsticks before you go.

45:30.220 --> 45:33.560
Well...

45:33.560 --> 45:34.550
Can we drink some somaek, too?
[mix of beer and soju]

45:34.560 --> 45:37.890
Do whatever you want. 
I'm not playing bartender.

45:43.570 --> 45:45.730
I'm from Hancheong Church.

45:45.740 --> 45:47.900
This is domestically made candy.

45:47.910 --> 45:48.900
Ajussi.

45:48.910 --> 45:50.070
Do you have some pork belly?

45:50.080 --> 45:51.070
<i>Yes, we do.</i>

45:51.080 --> 45:53.570
Okay, give me some beef and
some pork belly strips.

45:53.580 --> 45:55.240
Okay.

45:57.080 --> 46:00.420
Today, it looks like chicken
is the best.

46:00.420 --> 46:02.080
Hold on.

46:02.090 --> 46:05.080
Damn you.

46:05.930 --> 46:08.920
Are you a pastor?

46:08.930 --> 46:11.090
Do you want to accept Jesus?

46:14.430 --> 46:17.270
7 to 3 is the golden ratio.

46:18.600 --> 46:21.100
Shouldn't he eat something?

46:21.110 --> 46:21.770
I should.

46:21.770 --> 46:23.110
No, no.

46:23.110 --> 46:25.440
His stomach is full. He doesn't
need to eat to live.

46:25.440 --> 46:29.440
This is a man who will never be 
hungry by the glory and grace 
of God.

46:29.450 --> 46:30.280
Who?

46:30.280 --> 46:31.610
A neighborhood resident.

46:31.620 --> 46:32.610
Don't worry about him.

46:32.620 --> 46:36.110
He's a born barbecue expert.

46:36.120 --> 46:37.610
He's your younger brother?

46:37.620 --> 46:41.290
Are you checking our family 
registry? Grill your meat.

46:41.290 --> 46:43.290
Are you married?

46:43.300 --> 46:44.790
Chew your meat.

46:44.800 --> 46:47.130
Check what family registry?

46:47.130 --> 46:49.470
I'm not married.

46:49.470 --> 46:50.970
Do you live in this neighborhood?

46:50.970 --> 46:52.130
Hey, the atmosphere isn't bad.

46:52.140 --> 46:55.300
There's still a lot of meat. 
I'll make one for you.

46:55.310 --> 46:56.640
I'll fix it for you.

46:56.640 --> 46:58.300
I don't want all that fat.

46:58.310 --> 47:00.470
The lean meat is best. 
Lean meat, okay?

47:00.480 --> 47:01.980
Garlic? One or two?

47:01.980 --> 47:03.970
Two.

47:03.980 --> 47:05.640
Eat this up.

47:05.650 --> 47:06.640
Onion?

47:06.650 --> 47:08.480
A little bit.

47:08.490 --> 47:10.150
Eat a lot.

47:11.990 --> 47:13.480
Here.

47:13.490 --> 47:14.820
Have a drink first.

47:15.495 --> 47:16.990
Here.

47:17.000 --> 47:20.830
<i>Drink this first.</i>

47:20.830 --> 47:22.160
Here.

47:38.520 --> 47:42.010
You can't leave empty-handed.

47:55.200 --> 47:56.860
Thank goodness.

47:56.870 --> 47:59.860
Du Yeong and his brother 
have gotten a lot closer.

48:02.210 --> 48:04.370
Your purpose...

48:04.380 --> 48:07.370
is to butt into other people's 
business?

48:07.380 --> 48:09.040
Du Yeong,

48:09.050 --> 48:11.210
was once a star of hope.

48:11.220 --> 48:13.050
He fell before he could shine.

48:13.050 --> 48:14.547
So I feel so hurt.

48:16.060 --> 48:17.720
That's why I butt in.

48:27.400 --> 48:29.060
I won't be so hard on you again.

48:31.070 --> 48:32.730
Because of you,

48:32.740 --> 48:35.230
Du Yeong was smiling.

48:49.920 --> 48:51.580
Do you really have the heart?

48:51.590 --> 48:53.920
It's my independent will, brat.

49:01.270 --> 49:04.100
You have to learn to do these 
things.

49:04.100 --> 49:06.090
Then you can get a wife, brat.

49:06.110 --> 49:08.100
What crazy woman would
marry me?

49:08.110 --> 49:08.770
Oh?

49:08.770 --> 49:11.610
With your looks, why not?

49:11.610 --> 49:13.440
You must have dated a few girls.

49:13.450 --> 49:15.940
When I was in training, 
how could I?

49:15.950 --> 49:18.110
I was working very hard to 
win a gold medal.

49:18.120 --> 49:20.450
You really wasted your youth.

49:20.450 --> 49:22.940
I really can't take it.

49:22.960 --> 49:25.290
Brat, today you're going to 
pick up a girl.

49:25.290 --> 49:26.780
Are you kidding me?

49:28.630 --> 49:32.290
The simplest thing in this world
is to pick up a girl.

49:32.300 --> 49:34.130
For me, it's the hardest.

49:34.130 --> 49:35.790
Come over here, kid.

49:35.800 --> 49:36.630
Now it's more difficult.

49:36.640 --> 49:38.140
Sit down.

49:38.140 --> 49:40.970
This kid, seriously.

49:41.970 --> 49:44.470
Should I explain to you this
thing about women?

49:44.480 --> 49:47.470
This poor fool.

49:47.480 --> 49:49.310
Shut up.

49:49.320 --> 49:51.810
Wait a second.

49:51.820 --> 49:53.650
About girls...

49:55.150 --> 49:55.810
Yeah.

49:55.820 --> 49:57.650
I'll just use judo to explain.

49:57.660 --> 49:58.990
Judo?

49:58.990 --> 50:02.150
Judo.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.990
There's a cola bottle in front
of you. Feel it.

50:10.500 --> 50:11.830
Feel it.

50:11.840 --> 50:14.830
Hold it firmly. Resolutely.

50:14.840 --> 50:16.500
Hold it tighter.

50:16.510 --> 50:18.000
A little tighter.

50:18.010 --> 50:19.340
That's it.

50:19.350 --> 50:21.010
Push it. Pull it.

50:21.010 --> 50:23.500
See? Push, pull.

50:23.520 --> 50:26.010
With women, it's push and pull.

50:26.850 --> 50:27.510
This is a must.

50:27.520 --> 50:28.350
Push.

50:28.350 --> 50:29.840
And...

50:31.360 --> 50:33.520
Your timing has to be right.

50:33.530 --> 50:34.690
Then, when the time comes...

50:34.690 --> 50:36.190
then immediately...

50:36.200 --> 50:36.850
the takedown.

50:36.860 --> 50:40.030
This is already half of your
victory.

50:40.030 --> 50:40.860
And after the takedown?

50:40.870 --> 50:43.200
After the takedown I told you,
it's just like in judo.

50:43.200 --> 50:45.360
There's also some...

50:45.370 --> 50:47.360
Some charm and skill.

50:47.370 --> 50:48.360
Conquer her.

50:48.370 --> 50:51.370
You want to intoxicate her.

50:51.380 --> 50:54.210
Make her intoxicated.

50:54.210 --> 50:55.870
If she runs away? Catch her.

50:55.880 --> 50:57.540
Catch her and hold onto her.

50:57.550 --> 51:00.040
Finally, a merciless move 
towards victory.

51:00.050 --> 51:02.540
Enough.

51:02.560 --> 51:04.550
You still need some ability.

51:04.560 --> 51:07.050
How can you worry? Just win.

51:08.890 --> 51:10.890
You can move your eyes, right?

51:10.900 --> 51:14.060
With your eyes, look left and
then to the lower left,

51:14.070 --> 51:16.400
about 10 seconds.

51:17.570 --> 51:18.730
What?

51:18.740 --> 51:19.240
Like this?

51:19.240 --> 51:20.730
That's good. Then...

51:20.740 --> 51:24.400
Cross your legs and look to 
the upper right for 3 seconds.

51:27.410 --> 51:30.080
I didn't mean give someone
the side-eye!

51:30.080 --> 51:30.910
Enough!

51:30.920 --> 51:32.420
Like that.

51:32.420 --> 51:33.910
It's just like that.

51:33.920 --> 51:35.420
Hey. It's not kicking out.

51:35.420 --> 51:36.910
Don't kick out.

51:36.920 --> 51:37.910
This way, this way.

51:37.920 --> 51:39.250
That's right!

51:39.260 --> 51:42.090
Rough, tough, like a wild horse.

51:42.090 --> 51:45.930
Maintain that feeling and add 
some touching words.

51:45.930 --> 51:47.260
Some touching words?

51:47.270 --> 51:49.600
"People have two kinds of eyes."

51:49.600 --> 51:51.430
"Their physical eyes and..."

51:51.440 --> 51:55.100
"spiritual eyes."

51:55.110 --> 51:59.600
"Regrettably, I have already 
lost my physical eyes..."

51:59.610 --> 52:00.940
"Regrettably, I have already
lost my physical eyes..."

52:00.950 --> 52:02.940
But isn't that a bit cheesy?

52:02.950 --> 52:05.610
Let me finish.

52:05.620 --> 52:08.780
"However, God..."

52:08.790 --> 52:11.000
"has given me another type
of eyes."

52:13.290 --> 52:15.450
"Spiritual eyes."

52:15.460 --> 52:16.620
Spiritual eyes.

52:16.630 --> 52:19.290
Right. Just that way.

52:19.800 --> 52:21.300
Done!

52:53.670 --> 52:55.160
Some self-confidence,

52:55.170 --> 52:58.330
and clothes make the man.

53:05.340 --> 53:07.010
Spiritual eyes.

53:42.720 --> 53:45.050
<i>My leg is starting to feel numb.</i>

53:45.050 --> 53:45.880
<i>Can't I change positions?</i>

53:45.880 --> 53:48.550
<i>No!</i>

53:48.550 --> 53:49.540
My back hurts.

53:49.560 --> 53:51.550
Just suck it up!

53:51.560 --> 53:53.220
Where do things come easy 
in this world?

53:53.230 --> 53:56.390
I will go fishing for a great girl
and bring her back.

53:56.400 --> 53:57.560
Just stay right here.

53:57.560 --> 53:58.390
Hey!

53:58.400 --> 53:59.890
What?

53:59.900 --> 54:02.060
I...

54:02.070 --> 54:03.060
want a Jeon Ji Hyeon style.

54:03.900 --> 54:07.900
You don't want much. I'll just go
find a goddess or something.

54:08.570 --> 54:11.410
People have two kinds.

54:11.410 --> 54:13.900
People have two kinds of eyes.

54:13.910 --> 54:16.400
Their physical eyes,

54:16.420 --> 54:18.410
and their spiritual eyes.

54:18.420 --> 54:22.080
Are you here alone?

54:22.090 --> 54:24.080
Yes.

54:24.090 --> 54:25.920
I came with a friend.

54:25.920 --> 54:28.420
Oh, I see!

54:28.430 --> 54:31.590
My friend had to force me 
to come here.

54:31.600 --> 54:33.090
Since it's my first time,

54:33.100 --> 54:35.760
I feel a bit awkward.

54:35.770 --> 54:39.600
Do you mind if I talk to you
for a little while?

54:39.610 --> 54:41.600
Okay.

54:49.280 --> 54:53.120
People have two kinds of eyes.

54:53.120 --> 54:55.110
Their physical eyes,

54:55.120 --> 54:58.950
- and their spiritual eyes.
- Spiritual eyes?

54:58.960 --> 55:01.290
You may have already noticed.

55:01.290 --> 55:03.280
Regretfully, I...

55:03.300 --> 55:06.960
have lost my physical eyes.

55:06.970 --> 55:08.300
And so...

55:08.300 --> 55:10.960
I was hesitating for quite awhile.

55:10.970 --> 55:12.300
Omo.

55:12.300 --> 55:14.800
Omo. What should we do?

55:14.810 --> 55:16.970
But,

55:19.480 --> 55:23.470
God...

55:23.480 --> 55:25.810
has blessed me with another
type of eyes.

55:25.820 --> 55:28.810
Spiritual eyes.

55:28.820 --> 55:31.480
Then use your spiritual eyes.

55:31.490 --> 55:33.820
How do I look to you?

55:34.830 --> 55:36.320
Are you Jeon Ji Hyeon?

55:36.330 --> 55:38.820
Omo. You really can see!

55:38.830 --> 55:43.500
People always say I'm a mix of
Jeon Ji Hyeon and Kim Tae Hee.

55:43.500 --> 55:44.490
Don't you think the two of us

55:44.500 --> 55:46.990
get along very well?

55:47.010 --> 55:50.000
- Yes.
- You're so handsome!

55:50.010 --> 55:53.000
Omo. How can you be so 
handsome?

55:53.010 --> 55:56.000
Do you want to kiss me?
Do you? Don't you?

55:56.010 --> 55:58.850
Then, I'm going to kiss you.

56:01.850 --> 56:02.340
What?

56:02.350 --> 56:04.690
Wait, wait, wait!

56:04.690 --> 56:06.520
Wait! Let go, let go. 
Hold on a minute!

56:06.530 --> 56:08.360
Omo, omo! What are you doing? 
What are you doing?

56:08.360 --> 56:10.690
Excuse me, I'm sorry. I was
worried. No, no, no.

56:10.700 --> 56:13.030
He must be drunk already. 
He's my little brother.

56:13.030 --> 56:13.360
- No.
- I'm his brother.

56:13.370 --> 56:13.870
- No.
- I'm his brother.

56:13.870 --> 56:15.530
No, wait. We haven't finished.

56:15.530 --> 56:17.020
No. Let go. Let go.

56:17.040 --> 56:17.870
Why do I have to go?

56:17.870 --> 56:18.200
Go away!

56:18.200 --> 56:19.530
No! Who are you?

56:19.540 --> 56:20.030
Who are you?

56:20.040 --> 56:21.370
I'm a woman. Why?

56:21.370 --> 56:22.870
No, you're not a woman. Go!

56:22.880 --> 56:24.210
You're like a bandage on a dog.

56:24.210 --> 56:24.710
Thank you!

56:24.710 --> 56:25.370
Thanks for nothing.

56:25.380 --> 56:26.370
He just thanked me!

56:26.380 --> 56:27.370
He didn't want to!

56:27.380 --> 56:28.040
Seriously.

56:28.050 --> 56:29.040
Go away!

56:29.050 --> 56:30.710
- I'll see you later! 
- Absolutely not! Go! Hurry!

56:30.720 --> 56:32.210
Don't ever see her. 
Don't look at her.

56:32.220 --> 56:34.210
Brat, I was so...

56:34.220 --> 56:35.380
Couldn't you be patient?

56:35.390 --> 56:36.890
I can't stand it. Give me a 
wet paper towel.

56:36.890 --> 56:37.550
Why?

56:37.560 --> 56:39.890
Why? That thing...

56:39.890 --> 56:40.720
Your lips, your lips...

56:40.730 --> 56:42.560
Your lips look like a clown.

56:42.560 --> 56:44.050
What? Was she alone?

56:44.060 --> 56:46.390
That really scared me. 
Seriously. That face.

56:46.400 --> 56:48.390
Hey, let me see.

56:48.400 --> 56:50.730
How hard did she suck on you?

56:50.740 --> 56:53.570
I told you just to wait there, 
you asshole.

56:53.570 --> 56:57.570
She said she was a mix of Kim 
Tae Hee and Jeon Ji Hyeon.

56:57.580 --> 56:59.910
She did?

56:59.910 --> 57:03.250
Wow. That bitch.

57:04.420 --> 57:06.250
That's how this world is.

57:06.250 --> 57:07.750
It's very scary.

57:07.750 --> 57:09.910
A creature like that dares to 
use a goddess' name.

57:09.920 --> 57:12.250
It's really horrible.

57:12.260 --> 57:13.920
Her body...

57:13.930 --> 57:17.090
seemed pretty nice.

57:17.100 --> 57:19.760
You little brat.

57:19.770 --> 57:21.930
So you had the skills to check 
out her body so quickly.

57:21.930 --> 57:23.600
I guess the student really can
surpass the master.

57:27.940 --> 57:29.430
So what did she look like?

57:29.440 --> 57:33.280
If you knew, you wouldn't be 
able to sleep. Let's just say
it was Jeon Ji Hyeon.

57:33.280 --> 57:36.440
Then I would like some more.

57:36.450 --> 57:37.950
Listen carefully, okay?

57:40.120 --> 57:41.620
Let's say you are dead drunk.

57:41.620 --> 57:44.610
You can't tell if you're on the
street or in your room.

57:44.620 --> 57:45.450
That means...

57:45.460 --> 57:47.450
the sidewalk even looks like 
a ladder.

57:47.460 --> 57:49.790
You can't tell if the electricity
poles are upright or lying down.

57:49.800 --> 57:51.630
That's how being that drunk
feels.

57:51.630 --> 57:52.120
- But...
- But?

57:52.130 --> 57:52.960
But,

57:52.970 --> 57:55.300
even in that condition, the 
moment you saw that woman's 
face,

57:55.300 --> 57:57.800
you're suddenly fucking sober!

58:02.140 --> 58:04.300
Shit.

58:06.140 --> 58:07.480
That's why I say,

58:07.480 --> 58:09.140
Managing Director Go,

58:09.150 --> 58:13.140
next time until Chairman Go 
gives you the okay, just wait.

58:17.990 --> 58:19.820
Hello.

58:19.830 --> 58:22.320
I was told to come in and get 
my test results.

58:22.330 --> 58:23.830
But I didn't come in for any
checkup,

58:23.830 --> 58:25.490
so why would I have any test
results?

58:25.500 --> 58:27.830
May I ask your name, please?

58:27.830 --> 58:29.490
Go Du Sik.

58:29.500 --> 58:32.830
You came in through the 
emergency room last time.

58:32.840 --> 58:36.000
Your CT scan and blood test 
results are ready.

58:36.010 --> 58:39.000
Oh, that's what it must be.

58:39.010 --> 58:40.670
Where should I wait?

58:40.680 --> 58:42.340
You'll help me get in quickly?

58:42.350 --> 58:44.340
Sure.

58:48.520 --> 58:49.850
Excuse me.

58:51.020 --> 58:53.510
Excuse me.

58:55.190 --> 58:57.680
Mr. Go Du Sik.

58:57.700 --> 59:00.360
Just a moment.

59:01.870 --> 59:04.030
This is very difficult for you to
accept so suddenly.

59:04.040 --> 59:05.700
I understand.

59:05.700 --> 59:08.540
- It will be very...
- Just hold on a moment.

59:29.230 --> 59:31.720
= The number you have called
is currently unavailable.=

59:55.420 --> 59:57.410
Say something that people can
understand!

59:57.420 --> 59:59.580
Can't you figure something out?

59:59.590 --> 01:00:01.250
Customer,

01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:04.750
there's nothing we can do 
because of Professor Kim's
surgery schedule.

01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:07.760
I mean, that quack just told me
I'll kick off in 3 months.

01:00:07.770 --> 01:00:10.260
But I have to wait a few months
until I can see the best doctor.

01:00:10.270 --> 01:00:11.100
This is a bullshit situation.

01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:12.430
This is a bullshit situation.

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:14.930
Can't an educated person even
add and subtract?

01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:16.270
Customer, the hospital system...

01:00:16.270 --> 01:00:18.270
I get it! It's the system!

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:21.440
Register now and wait months
to get treatment, that system.

01:00:21.450 --> 01:00:22.780
I know about the damn system!

01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:24.940
But tell me, don't you have a
responsibility?

01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:26.610
If I wait and wait until I die, 
don't you have...

01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:28.120
What are you looking at?

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:30.110
Shit.

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:32.450
- Customer, I'm sorry, but you 
can't act like this. 
- Let go. Let go.

01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:35.450
Instead of that nonsense, give
me a solution! A solution!

01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:35.960
Please calm down.

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:37.290
What's a solution?

01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:39.290
He said I have fucking late
stage pancreatic cancer!

01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:41.290
I'm just supposed to wait until
I die?

01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:43.790
Until I die?... 
Let me go, you fucker!

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:44.790
What?

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:46.630
What should I do? 
Figure something out!

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:47.630
Answer me!

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:49.300
Some fucking university hospital!

01:00:49.310 --> 01:00:51.140
It's worse than a fucking 
private hospital!

01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:52.300
Do I look like I don't have 
money?

01:00:52.310 --> 01:00:53.140
Fuck off.

01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:54.130
I have money.

01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:55.480
I'll give you money!

01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:56.640
I'll give you money!

01:00:56.650 --> 01:01:00.980
I'll give you money. Just give
me a fucking appointment!

01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:02.980
What are you looking at?

01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:24.510
Body waste builds up, what 
does that mean?

01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:25.600
Better to die cleanly?

01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:46.700
Why isn't he answering his
phone?

01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:14.610
What's that sound?

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:21.790
What if you get injured?
You could get burned...

01:03:21.790 --> 01:03:23.450
Let me see.

01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:25.450
You did get burned, damn it.

01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:27.800
Where is the medicine?

01:03:36.810 --> 01:03:38.970
Does a beggar live in your
stomach?

01:03:38.980 --> 01:03:41.310
If you're hungry, just tell me 
and I'll make it for you!

01:03:41.310 --> 01:03:43.470
I wanted to cook for you.

01:03:46.650 --> 01:03:50.140
What is this shit?

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:52.990
Mom would always fry an egg.

01:03:52.990 --> 01:03:54.150
That's how you liked it.

01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:58.150
This is a real variety show.

01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:05.160
The persimmon tree in the
courtyard,

01:04:05.170 --> 01:04:07.500
grew up eating fried eggs.

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:09.170
After waiting for you all day,

01:04:09.170 --> 01:04:11.840
when it was cold, she'd bury it 
under the tree.

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:14.180
She'd say, "Eat this and grow
delicious persimmons for my 
Du Sik to eat."

01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:15.840
She'd say, "Eat this and grow
delicious persimmons for my
Du Sik to eat."

01:04:15.850 --> 01:04:17.010
That's how it was.

01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:20.510
That's fucking enough.

01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:22.850
Are you trying to make me
feel bad?

01:04:22.850 --> 01:04:26.190
Did you think I'd believe that?

01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:28.850
Stay put. I'll go and buy 
some medicine.

01:04:36.530 --> 01:04:39.030
What the hell?

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:50.870
Can you walk?

01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:52.540
Yes.

01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:56.880
I'll get you some clothes.

01:04:56.890 --> 01:04:59.050
Where are we going?

01:04:59.060 --> 01:05:01.720
You said you wanted to see
your mom.

01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:21.240
Mom.

01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:23.240
Dad.

01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:27.240
We came together.

01:05:27.250 --> 01:05:30.240
You don't need to worry anymore.

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:47.270
I'm going to the restroom. 
Wait here.

01:05:47.270 --> 01:05:49.260
Hey...

01:05:50.610 --> 01:05:52.440
Hurry back.

01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:12.620
One of your two sons became
blind.

01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:18.130
Father's son from his second
marriage.

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:20.970
As for me...

01:06:22.470 --> 01:06:25.640
I'm going to die soon.

01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:27.630
All of our previous resentment,

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:30.640
we can settle it soon when we
all meet.

01:06:30.650 --> 01:06:33.140
But that kid...

01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:39.650
Du Yeong...

01:06:45.330 --> 01:06:47.490
What should I do?

01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:51.330
Don't just smile at me like 
that and tell me.

01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:01.170
Drink this slowly.

01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:08.680
Here.

01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:16.190
It's good, right?

01:07:16.190 --> 01:07:17.530
It's good.

01:07:21.370 --> 01:07:22.530
You...

01:07:22.530 --> 01:07:25.370
used to be pretty good at judo,
I hear.

01:07:25.370 --> 01:07:27.700
I heard you were a gold medal
contender.

01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:29.870
If you've got great skills like
that, it's a shame to waste it.

01:07:29.870 --> 01:07:32.870
If you've got great skills like
that, it's a shame to waste it.

01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:33.870
Then,

01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:35.210
you didn't get a chance.

01:07:35.210 --> 01:07:39.050
Where is... What's it called?

01:07:39.050 --> 01:07:40.210
The Paralympics?

01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:42.550
If you participated in that, 
you could find out, right?

01:07:42.550 --> 01:07:44.550
What are you trying to say?

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:46.390
Start again. Judo.

01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:48.050
You wanted to tell me that?

01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:49.220
Yeah.

01:07:49.230 --> 01:07:50.060
I don't want to.

01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:52.050
Why?

01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:56.230
Are you afraid people will say
you're trying too hard?

01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:58.570
I can't even go to the 
supermarket.

01:08:00.570 --> 01:08:04.410
I can't even buy a package of
ramen by myself!

01:08:04.410 --> 01:08:06.570
How can someone like that
represent their country?

01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:09.070
I'm saying I'll help you.

01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:11.570
I will help you.

01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:14.420
Your coach will, and other 
people will too.

01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:18.750
We'll help you and will never
abandon you.

01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:26.420
Let's go.

01:08:35.270 --> 01:08:37.260
Are you crazy?

01:08:37.270 --> 01:08:38.939
How can I run?

01:08:38.939 --> 01:08:40.270
Don't you know this place?

01:08:40.279 --> 01:08:42.770
When we were young, we 
played all day long here.

01:08:42.779 --> 01:08:44.439
It's not the same as it used to be.

01:08:44.450 --> 01:08:46.109
It's the same.

01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:47.450
It hasn't changed a bit.

01:08:47.450 --> 01:08:52.120
I used to be by your side and
I'm still by your side, right?

01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:54.630
I don't want to.

01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:55.460
Let's go home.

01:09:00.630 --> 01:09:03.460
How long are you going to 
stay stuck in that house?

01:09:03.470 --> 01:09:06.960
How does someone who spent 
their life as an athlete just 
give it up?

01:09:06.970 --> 01:09:09.970
I might as well die.

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:15.979
Ah, fuck that! Seriously.

01:09:18.479 --> 01:09:20.470
Die?

01:09:22.149 --> 01:09:23.979
Is dying so trivial?

01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:26.319
We're all going to die, but if it
were me, I'd at least run before
I fucking die!

01:09:26.319 --> 01:09:27.319
We're all going to die, but if it
were me, I'd at least run before
I fucking die!

01:09:27.330 --> 01:09:29.660
What won't you do if you're
about to die?

01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:31.649
I'm scared.

01:09:39.670 --> 01:09:42.500
I will watch out for you, okay?

01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:49.340
Try running and see.

01:09:49.350 --> 01:09:51.340
Du Yeong.

01:09:54.690 --> 01:09:58.520
Start running, Go Du Yeong!

01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:02.360
Trust me and run, you brat!

01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:04.350
<i>Run!</i>

01:10:06.030 --> 01:10:08.190
Very good!

01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:14.370
Very good, Go Du Yeong!

01:10:16.710 --> 01:10:18.200
Very good.

01:10:37.230 --> 01:10:39.390
Are you all right?

01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:43.060
Well done.

01:10:43.070 --> 01:10:45.560
Well done.

01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:51.900
- Will you help me?
- I'll help you.

01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:55.400
If people laugh at me,

01:10:55.410 --> 01:10:57.240
will you help me teach them 
a lesson?

01:10:57.250 --> 01:11:01.240
I'll throttle them, those fucking
sons of bitches.

01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:07.760
What's going on that you 
ran over here?

01:11:09.930 --> 01:11:11.760
Did you put on makeup?

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:13.420
Well, just a little.

01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:15.260
Some BB cream isn't enough.

01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:17.600
It's too bad.

01:11:33.450 --> 01:11:36.280
Let's turn Go Du Yeong into a 
national athlete.

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:38.790
National athlete?

01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:39.780
Du Yeong wants to?

01:11:39.790 --> 01:11:40.620
It wasn't easy to convince him.

01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:43.620
We need to train him quickly
before he changes his mind.

01:11:43.630 --> 01:11:45.120
What happened suddenly?

01:11:45.130 --> 01:11:46.290
Why are you curious?

01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:48.290
You're so nosy.

01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:53.460
By the way,

01:11:53.470 --> 01:11:55.630
well...

01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:58.630
if the athlete wins a gold medal, 
do they get some kind of a pension?

01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:00.800
They won't cut it in half because
they're disabled or something?

01:12:00.810 --> 01:12:04.810
It's all the same. They get a
pension and a bonus.

01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:05.310
Why?

01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:06.980
Are you going to take it away?

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.660
I have one condition.

01:12:19.660 --> 01:12:23.160
You have to always be on 
his side.

01:12:23.170 --> 01:12:25.500
I think you may not understand
this,

01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:27.330
but I am a team coach.

01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:30.170
The team also has other 
mentors and coaches.

01:12:30.170 --> 01:12:32.340
Then you're a swindler.

01:12:32.340 --> 01:12:33.000
What does that mean?

01:12:33.010 --> 01:12:36.170
I need to know he's not alone 
and will have people to help him.

01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:37.840
You can just act as his manager.

01:12:37.850 --> 01:12:41.340
For training and competition, 
just follow him around.

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:51.350
We have a history.

01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:54.020
After Du Yeong was born, 
I really liked him.

01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:56.360
But as he grew up, I started to
really hate him.

01:12:56.370 --> 01:12:58.700
He didn't do anything wrong.

01:12:58.700 --> 01:13:01.190
Probably, Go Du Yeong feels
it was unfair.

01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:04.540
Since we just met again, I
want to take care of him.

01:13:06.380 --> 01:13:08.210
But it seems I have cancer.

01:13:08.210 --> 01:13:10.200
I'm going to die.

01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:18.710
So I'm saying Go Du Yeong will
be alone and I need you to help him.

01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:21.390
If you don't help him,

01:13:21.390 --> 01:13:23.380
Du Yeong won't become a 
national athlete.

01:13:23.390 --> 01:13:25.890
There's no one except you.

01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:32.730
I only put 300 km on it.

01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:35.400
Please handle it for me.

01:13:35.410 --> 01:13:38.070
But why do you want to sell
this car already?

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:40.240
No reason.

01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:41.400
<i>What? What did you say?</i>

01:13:41.410 --> 01:13:42.240
<i>Where are you going?</i>

01:13:42.250 --> 01:13:45.240
To be a Paralympic athlete
coach.

01:13:45.250 --> 01:13:47.740
Why would you do that?

01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:49.240
<i>Hey, Lee Su Hyeon.</i>

01:13:49.250 --> 01:13:50.910
Have you been drinking?

01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:54.260
I want to take Go Du Yeong.

01:13:54.260 --> 01:13:56.920
Du Yeong wants to continue
training?

01:13:56.930 --> 01:13:57.420
Yes.

01:13:57.430 --> 01:13:58.760
Then leave Du Yeong alone.

01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:00.920
I'll make a call and find someone
to take good care of him.

01:14:00.930 --> 01:14:03.260
If he doesn't train with me, 
he won't let him go.

01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:04.930
Who? Who won't let him? Who?

01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:06.600
His older brother.

01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:08.600
I'll come back after Du Yeong 
has settled in.

01:14:08.610 --> 01:14:09.940
What if you come back?

01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:13.430
Who guarantees your position
will be available?

01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:14.780
In that case,

01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:17.270
I'll just keep working with the 
disabled team until I die.

01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:18.440
You're really unbelievable!

01:14:18.450 --> 01:14:19.280
Hey, kid!

01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:20.610
You've worked so hard until now!

01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:23.950
You're telling me you want to
undo all that?

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:26.450
If I leave Du Yeong all alone,

01:14:26.460 --> 01:14:29.950
I'll be distracted and always
worried about him.

01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:32.120
Do you think it's easy for me?

01:14:32.130 --> 01:14:34.960
Go Du Yeong isn't your brother!
Why are you worried for him?

01:14:34.970 --> 01:14:37.630
I have to prove it to him!

01:14:39.470 --> 01:14:42.800
Even if he has lost everything,

01:14:42.810 --> 01:14:44.470
even if everything in front of
him is dark,

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:47.310
he can live his life with a smile.

01:14:47.310 --> 01:14:49.470
It also drives me crazy that it's 
come to this point.

01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:51.470
But,

01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:59.820
if I'm going to take Du Yeong's
hand,

01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:02.990
I have to drop the hand I'm 
holding.

01:15:02.990 --> 01:15:06.490
Only then can I take his hand.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.330
You should help me.

01:15:13.670 --> 01:15:14.660
Hey, Tae Won Seong, kid!

01:15:14.670 --> 01:15:16.660
If you keep goofing off, just 
see what I do!

01:15:16.670 --> 01:15:18.160
Are you paying attention?

01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:21.010
<i>This kid, do you want to die?</i>

01:15:25.350 --> 01:15:29.840
Go Du Yeong's eyes have arrived.

01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:35.010
What is this?

01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:36.690
What else? Your eyes.

01:15:36.690 --> 01:15:38.860
This goes in your hand.

01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:39.850
I don't want it.

01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:42.700
Instead of not moving because
you can't see, use this.

01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:47.190
You can step boldly forward! 
That's a lot better.

01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:48.360
You just flick this open.

01:15:48.370 --> 01:15:51.030
Hold it like this...

01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:56.040
It's a little noisy, noisy.

01:16:21.910 --> 01:16:24.740
Am I feeling it?

01:16:24.740 --> 01:16:27.400
Seriously.

01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:31.240
Of all the blind people in this
world, you're the best.

01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:35.580
What bullshit is that?

01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:52.440
-=2016 Paralympic Qualifying=-

01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:54.770
<i>Get ready!</i>

01:16:54.770 --> 01:16:56.760
<i>Begin!</i>

01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:15.120
<i>Yuko, white!</i>

01:17:15.130 --> 01:17:16.790
<i>Score!</i>

01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:18.960
Yuko? Yuko?

01:17:27.970 --> 01:17:29.300
Hey, Go Du Yeong!

01:17:29.310 --> 01:17:32.970
Are you afraid of hurting your
opponent?

01:17:37.150 --> 01:17:39.480
<i>Get ready!</i>

01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:42.650
<i>Begin!</i>

01:17:50.490 --> 01:17:51.150
Ippon!

01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:53.650
<i>Ippon scored! Winner!</i>

01:17:53.660 --> 01:17:55.660
<i>Competition ended!</i>

01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:00.660
But,

01:18:00.670 --> 01:18:03.160
is the car broken?

01:18:03.170 --> 01:18:05.170
The car?

01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:07.510
I sold it.

01:18:07.510 --> 01:18:09.670
Why?

01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:12.340
Are you tired of taking the bus
and the subway?

01:18:12.350 --> 01:18:13.510
No, that's not it.

01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:15.180
You're an athlete.

01:18:15.190 --> 01:18:17.350
You must be tough in the face
of hardships.

01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:20.850
If you keep eating only ramen
noodles, you'll surely win the 
gold medal.

01:18:20.860 --> 01:18:23.350
- When it was 19...
- I'm going.

01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:25.350
Even when his brother is talking.

01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:26.690
Thank you.

01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:29.190
Do well. Stay strong.

01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:40.870
Fortunately,

01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:46.210
since none of you can see,

01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:51.210
you won't be too stunned by 
my beauty to practice.

01:18:53.220 --> 01:18:55.390
In any case, no matter what 
anyone says,

01:18:55.390 --> 01:18:58.380
all of you are Korean national
athletes.

01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:02.060
So please do your best.

01:21:02.350 --> 01:21:05.020
$4.50

01:21:17.370 --> 01:21:19.700
What?

01:21:19.700 --> 01:21:21.690
You even deliver black bean
noodles,

01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:22.870
Mr. Pastor?

01:21:22.870 --> 01:21:25.870
Don't order just one bowl at
peak time.

01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:29.040
Shouldn't that be an unwritten
rule?

01:21:29.050 --> 01:21:32.210
This is crazy.

01:21:34.050 --> 01:21:35.380
Seriously.

01:21:40.390 --> 01:21:41.880
The church,

01:21:41.890 --> 01:21:44.550
is also a business.

01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:49.560
You can't get in without a 
college education.

01:21:49.570 --> 01:21:50.900
Those large churches,

01:21:50.900 --> 01:21:53.060
their annual salary is higher
than Samsung.

01:21:53.070 --> 01:21:54.560
That's why you majored in
theology?

01:21:54.570 --> 01:21:56.400
At least I could graduate with
a theology degree,

01:21:56.410 --> 01:21:58.570
so I took the theological 
college exam.

01:21:58.580 --> 01:22:00.240
A pastor. Aigoo.

01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:02.740
You became a pastor.

01:22:03.910 --> 01:22:06.580
It's so wrong. How can I even 
die in peace?

01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:08.740
Anyway, I dropped out of
school.

01:22:08.750 --> 01:22:10.250
You don't need to feel wronged.

01:22:10.250 --> 01:22:12.920
You can just die whenever it's
your time.

01:22:20.430 --> 01:22:21.420
Yes?

01:22:21.430 --> 01:22:24.270
Bastard, why haven't you 
come back from your delivery?

01:22:24.270 --> 01:22:25.100
What?

01:22:25.100 --> 01:22:26.930
If this is how you're going 
to be, then just quit.

01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:31.270
Okay.

01:22:31.940 --> 01:22:33.270
You're not leaving yet?

01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:34.270
Come on.

01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:37.940
You delivered a meal to my 
home and then you ate it.

01:22:39.620 --> 01:22:40.780
Do you have any beer?

01:22:40.780 --> 01:22:42.620
Why?

01:22:42.620 --> 01:22:45.610
They told me not to come back
to work.

01:22:48.790 --> 01:22:50.450
Really?

01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:51.790
<i>Du Yeong.</i>

01:22:53.460 --> 01:22:55.300
That friend is...

01:22:55.300 --> 01:22:58.130
really a kid with potential.

01:22:58.140 --> 01:23:01.300
A national athlete.

01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:04.470
Dig it deeper. If there's a 
hurricane, it will fall over.

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:08.480
You said you'd pay me daily.

01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:11.970
If you don't pay me, I can call
the Ministry of Labor.

01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:14.820
<i>Why are you laughing?</i>

01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:17.150
Afterward, you need to bury
a fried egg.

01:23:17.150 --> 01:23:18.820
You know,

01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:22.820
there are some good fertilizers.
Why use a fried egg?

01:23:22.830 --> 01:23:25.820
<i>Even I can't eat a fried egg.</i>

01:23:25.830 --> 01:23:26.990
<i>How is it?</i>

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:30.830
<i>It seems almost the same.
Come over and look.</i>

01:23:30.830 --> 01:23:31.820
What?

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:33.340
Hey!

01:23:33.340 --> 01:23:35.670
Hey, hey!

01:23:35.670 --> 01:23:38.510
What happened?

01:23:43.010 --> 01:23:44.840
I need 112.

01:23:44.850 --> 01:23:47.510
Please send an ambulance
here quickly!

01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:48.510
What?

01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:50.350
It's a waste of time.

01:23:50.350 --> 01:23:52.020
Yes, hyeong-nim.

01:23:52.020 --> 01:23:53.680
That's 119, right?

01:23:53.690 --> 01:23:56.350
119, yeah.

01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:58.190
Hang up.

01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:00.190
It's useless.

01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:22.220
You won't be home for a couple
of months.

01:24:22.220 --> 01:24:23.880
I know.

01:24:23.890 --> 01:24:25.390
All of the difficult work you've
been doing

01:24:25.390 --> 01:24:27.220
will pay off when we get to 
Brazil.

01:24:27.220 --> 01:24:29.220
Yes, Coach.

01:24:55.920 --> 01:24:58.750
This doesn't seem like our 
house.

01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:02.090
What did you do to this house?

01:25:04.070 --> 01:25:05.260
-=Home of Go Du Yeong=-

01:25:05.260 --> 01:25:05.910
Just let the feelings come.

01:25:05.910 --> 01:25:07.750
Just let the feelings come.

01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:10.430
Of the women in South America,

01:25:10.430 --> 01:25:12.430
Brazil is great.

01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:14.100
After the competition is over,

01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:15.940
I'm going to seduce a Brazilian
lady before I come back.

01:25:15.940 --> 01:25:17.440
Look at this kid.

01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:19.600
I belong to the global class.

01:25:19.610 --> 01:25:20.600
The moment I appear,

01:25:20.610 --> 01:25:24.270
they all start shouting about 
changing their nationality.

01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:25.770
But I can't speak English.

01:25:25.780 --> 01:25:28.110
That's why you're an amateur, kid.

01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:30.280
Do you only need your mouth 
to seduce a woman?

01:25:30.290 --> 01:25:31.450
It takes a feeling.

01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:34.450
You need a certain expression,
kid.

01:25:34.460 --> 01:25:36.450
A feeling.

01:25:37.460 --> 01:25:39.450
I hope I win the gold medal
this time.

01:25:39.460 --> 01:25:40.290
I should do well, right?

01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:42.290
Of course you will.

01:25:42.300 --> 01:25:44.960
That gold medal already belongs
to Go Du Yeong.

01:25:44.970 --> 01:25:47.960
Who can win that gold medal
besides you?

01:25:50.310 --> 01:25:52.300
It's all taken care of, almost.

01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:54.640
Oh yeah, there's something.

01:25:55.650 --> 01:25:56.810
I... got a job.

01:25:56.810 --> 01:25:58.310
I... got a job.

01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:00.150
A job?

01:26:00.150 --> 01:26:01.650
I'm not unemployed anymore.

01:26:01.650 --> 01:26:04.140
I have a friend in Busan.

01:26:04.150 --> 01:26:08.320
He's going to be erecting a 
large building and he asked me
to come.

01:26:08.330 --> 01:26:09.160
When?

01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:10.820
I guess...

01:26:10.830 --> 01:26:12.330
right away.

01:26:12.330 --> 01:26:15.990
He keeps bugging me to come
at once.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.490
Should I drop it and go to 
Brazil with you?

01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:20.490
You dropped out of high school,

01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:21.990
so it's not easy to find work.

01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:24.340
You little son of a bitch.

01:26:24.340 --> 01:26:25.830
Do you have to dig at someone's
sore spot?

01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:28.330
If you go down there and do
really well,

01:26:28.350 --> 01:26:30.340
you'll get hired permanently?

01:26:30.350 --> 01:26:32.340
That's right.

01:26:32.350 --> 01:26:35.680
Right. It's good if you have a 
job, then you can get married.

01:26:35.690 --> 01:26:37.850
Take care of yourself first. You.

01:26:37.850 --> 01:26:41.190
Kid, you're worried about
nothing.

01:26:41.190 --> 01:26:44.180
Then I should go to Brazil by
myself this time.

01:26:44.190 --> 01:26:46.360
With the coach.

01:26:48.530 --> 01:26:49.690
Will you be okay?

01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:52.690
I've gotten pretty good with
using my cane.

01:26:52.700 --> 01:26:55.370
As for the competition,

01:26:55.370 --> 01:26:56.360
I'm going to win.

01:26:56.370 --> 01:26:57.360
This kid.

01:26:57.370 --> 01:26:58.860
You're a pretty cocky guy.

01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:00.710
If you go there and don't win
the gold medal,

01:27:00.710 --> 01:27:03.370
just stay there in Brazil and
don't come back, you brat.

01:27:03.380 --> 01:27:04.210
You must dance the samba.

01:27:04.210 --> 01:27:05.550
You have to dance.

01:27:05.550 --> 01:27:07.380
Samba.

01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:10.720
How's this?

01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:12.210
Not too bad!

01:27:12.220 --> 01:27:13.720
You dance pretty well, Go Du Yeong.

01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:15.720
It's like this. Go like this.

01:27:15.730 --> 01:27:18.060
Move to the beat.

01:27:19.230 --> 01:27:21.220
Don't run around all over.

01:27:21.230 --> 01:27:23.060
Listen to that self-proclaimed
beautiful coach.

01:27:23.070 --> 01:27:24.400
I didn't call myself that, okay?

01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:26.230
Other people call me that.

01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:27.900
Please notice the mood here.

01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:30.400
We're trying to film the long
farewell scene, seriously.

01:27:30.410 --> 01:27:32.240
Be sure to work very hard.

01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:34.570
When I come back, I'll go
to Busan.

01:27:36.580 --> 01:27:38.570
Fine.

01:27:38.580 --> 01:27:40.070
We'll go eat some sashimi later.

01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:42.070
Remember to eat properly.

01:27:42.090 --> 01:27:44.250
- Things that are easy to digest... 
- Hurry, hurry. Let's go.

01:27:44.250 --> 01:27:45.920
You can't be late for your plane.

01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:47.580
Yes, your brother is right.

01:27:47.590 --> 01:27:49.250
Let's go.

01:27:49.260 --> 01:27:51.250
Be careful.

01:27:52.930 --> 01:27:54.920
I'm going.

01:27:54.930 --> 01:27:56.920
Okay, have a pleasant trip.

01:28:13.450 --> 01:28:15.110
<i>Republic of Korea athlete, 
Go Du Yeong.</i>

01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:17.450
<i>It's the quarter finals!</i>

01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:20.950
You're doing great.

01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:22.790
That throw-down was clean
and sharp.

01:28:22.790 --> 01:28:24.620
I'm sexy, right?

01:28:24.630 --> 01:28:28.120
Because of your brother, you've
been corrupted.

01:28:29.300 --> 01:28:32.130
I should call him.

01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:34.800
Sure. Let's show off to him.

01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:39.130
<i>I got into the quarter finals, 
did you see?</i>

01:28:39.140 --> 01:28:41.300
Of course I saw it.

01:28:41.310 --> 01:28:44.470
That super-photogenic, Go Du 
Yeong.

01:28:49.990 --> 01:28:51.490
You're in Busan?

01:28:51.490 --> 01:28:53.980
Can't you hear it?

01:28:53.990 --> 01:28:55.820
The seagulls are noisy.

01:29:00.330 --> 01:29:02.660
You can hear the samba music,
right?

01:29:02.670 --> 01:29:04.330
=It's really no joke!=

01:29:04.330 --> 01:29:06.170
=They dance right in front of you.=

01:29:06.170 --> 01:29:08.160
=The women have great bodies.=

01:29:08.170 --> 01:29:09.000
<i>I'm not kidding.</i>

01:29:09.010 --> 01:29:11.000
You're just bragging now.

01:29:12.510 --> 01:29:14.670
You're always bragging, kid.

01:29:16.180 --> 01:29:17.680
It's your bedtime, isn't it?

01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:18.670
Shouldn't you sleep?

01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:20.510
=I'm fine.=

01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:22.680
You have to go to work, right?

01:29:22.690 --> 01:29:24.020
Is the food good there?

01:29:24.020 --> 01:29:25.850
Yeah.

01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:28.350
=The food is good, but your
cooking is the best.=

01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:30.850
=Shin Ramyeon. Nagasaki...=
- Just a second.

01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:43.700
=Are you doing a good job?=

01:29:43.710 --> 01:29:45.700
=You can't be goofing off.=

01:29:45.710 --> 01:29:48.040
=I told you to work hard so 
you can get married.=

01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:50.380
=This time you really can 
get married.=

01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:54.550
Faker.
[fake pastor]

01:29:54.550 --> 01:29:55.880
What?

01:29:55.890 --> 01:29:58.880
Why are you giving me such
a scary look?

01:30:00.390 --> 01:30:04.380
How much is the hourly rate to
deliver black bean noodles?

01:30:04.390 --> 01:30:05.380
Why?

01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:07.560
I'll pay you more.

01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:09.050
Nursing fee.

01:30:09.070 --> 01:30:10.570
Am I crazy?

01:30:10.570 --> 01:30:12.560
That I'd be your nurse?

01:30:12.570 --> 01:30:13.400
I'm very busy.

01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:15.740
You're a faker, so how fucking
busy can you be?

01:30:15.740 --> 01:30:19.070
I'm tired of being called a faker,
so I want to do better.

01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:21.070
I'm going back to school.

01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:22.240
You're going to become a 
preacher?

01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:23.750
None of your business.

01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:24.740
When?

01:30:24.750 --> 01:30:25.910
I will.

01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:26.910
I won't stop you.

01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:28.910
When?

01:30:30.250 --> 01:30:31.580
Before that...

01:30:31.590 --> 01:30:34.080
help clean up my poop and urine.

01:30:35.930 --> 01:30:38.920
After I'm sent away, then you 
can go.

01:30:38.930 --> 01:30:41.760
That's so gross. Why would
you say that?

01:30:41.770 --> 01:30:42.930
Never mind.

01:30:42.930 --> 01:30:44.920
That's all then.

01:30:47.940 --> 01:30:50.930
I have to get up early to watch
Du Yeong. Set the alarm clock.

01:30:50.940 --> 01:30:53.270
Help me lie down.

01:30:56.450 --> 01:30:57.110
I said go lower.

01:30:57.110 --> 01:30:59.270
Ah, I got it.

01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:02.620
I'm a machine idiot.

01:31:20.140 --> 01:31:21.970
Du Yeong.

01:31:21.970 --> 01:31:23.130
What is it?

01:31:23.140 --> 01:31:25.300
Don't you feel well?

01:31:25.310 --> 01:31:27.470
I keep thinking about...

01:31:27.480 --> 01:31:29.310
my accident.

01:31:29.310 --> 01:31:31.470
That competition.

01:31:37.150 --> 01:31:38.990
You've done well until now.

01:31:38.990 --> 01:31:40.150
You can't dwell on that.

01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:42.490
Coach.

01:31:42.990 --> 01:31:45.660
I do want to win the 
gold medal...

01:31:45.660 --> 01:31:49.830
I do want to win the
gold medal...

01:31:49.830 --> 01:31:51.660
but I'm scared.

01:31:51.670 --> 01:31:54.330
I can't breathe.

01:31:54.340 --> 01:31:57.330
If I forfeit on the grounds 
of an injury...

01:31:57.340 --> 01:31:58.330
<i>Du Yeong.</i>

01:31:58.340 --> 01:32:00.170
<i>If you want to forfeit the 
match, then do so. </i>

01:32:00.180 --> 01:32:01.510
<i>Don't force yourself.</i>

01:32:01.510 --> 01:32:02.840
You're still young.

01:32:02.850 --> 01:32:04.840
You have very good ability.

01:32:04.850 --> 01:32:07.510
Next time, you might win it all.

01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:08.510
But,

01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:10.850
when that time comes...

01:32:16.860 --> 01:32:19.350
your brother...

01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:21.850
won't be around.

01:32:25.540 --> 01:32:26.700
<i>Du Yeong!</i>

01:32:26.700 --> 01:32:28.530
I have to go.

01:32:29.370 --> 01:32:30.360
I want to go back.

01:32:30.370 --> 01:32:31.360
Du Yeong!

01:32:31.370 --> 01:32:33.370
I don't want to! I have to go!

01:32:33.380 --> 01:32:34.880
Du Yeong, calm down.

01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:38.210
Your brother didn't want you to
know, because he was afraid
you'd do this!

01:32:40.220 --> 01:32:43.050
Do you think running back to
him right now is the right thing?

01:32:43.050 --> 01:32:45.210
Is that it?

01:32:45.220 --> 01:32:47.050
If it is, then go.

01:32:47.060 --> 01:32:49.720
We'll go back to Korea together.

01:33:08.580 --> 01:33:11.240
How much time is left?

01:33:11.250 --> 01:33:13.740
Until the match?

01:33:13.750 --> 01:33:16.240
About 5 minutes.

01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:22.590
I want to be alone.

01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:52.780
Oh, Brother.

01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:55.280
It's me.

01:33:55.290 --> 01:33:57.450
The women here are no joke.

01:33:57.460 --> 01:34:01.120
Damn. If I had known, I would 
have gone with you.

01:34:05.970 --> 01:34:08.300
Don't worry.

01:34:08.300 --> 01:34:11.470
I even got the phone number
from a samba dancer.

01:34:11.470 --> 01:34:12.980
Did you pick someone good
this time?

01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:14.640
You won't be taken advantage
of again?

01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:16.980
This kid never lets me relax.

01:34:16.980 --> 01:34:18.970
Are you kidding?

01:34:18.980 --> 01:34:20.970
This time it's the truth.

01:34:20.980 --> 01:34:22.470
=It's true?=

01:34:22.490 --> 01:34:25.150
=Aigoo. I should have gone.=

01:34:26.660 --> 01:34:28.650
The final round...

01:34:28.660 --> 01:34:31.150
Yes, it's the final round, Kid.

01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:33.490
Keep this in mind, you bastard.

01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:37.490
If you don't win the gold medal, 
stay there and don't come back.

01:34:37.500 --> 01:34:39.160
Stay in Brazil.

01:34:39.170 --> 01:34:41.660
If you dare come back, I'll go
to airport

01:34:41.670 --> 01:34:45.160
and prohibit you from entering
the country, kid.

01:34:45.180 --> 01:34:48.340
The life isn't bad here.

01:34:48.340 --> 01:34:49.850
But,

01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:56.680
I'm still going to bring a gold
medal back to South Korea.

01:34:58.350 --> 01:35:00.850
For sure.

01:35:00.860 --> 01:35:03.520
I will bring back a gold medal.

01:35:03.530 --> 01:35:05.520
=Just wait.=

01:35:05.530 --> 01:35:07.520
=Okay?=

01:35:08.700 --> 01:35:11.030
You have to wait.

01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:14.700
Du Yeong.

01:35:14.700 --> 01:35:17.370
Yes.

01:35:17.370 --> 01:35:20.870
I miss you.

01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:23.870
=I really miss you, so come
back quickly.=

01:35:27.220 --> 01:35:29.550
Is it very painful?

01:35:35.060 --> 01:35:37.890
=I said, is it very painful?=

01:35:55.250 --> 01:35:57.410
Come back soon.

01:36:02.590 --> 01:36:06.080
I'm about to die, so hurry,
you bastard.

01:36:07.420 --> 01:36:10.420
It hurts even more when you're
not around.

01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:14.930
Hurry back.

01:36:14.930 --> 01:36:17.920
Don't be in pain.

01:36:17.930 --> 01:36:20.600
I'll be back soon.

01:37:21.830 --> 01:37:24.490
You can do it, Go Du Yeong.

01:37:29.010 --> 01:37:30.840
<i>The 2016 Rio Paralympic Games.</i>

01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:34.330
<i>The finals of the Judo 60 kg 
class are about to begin.</i>

01:37:34.340 --> 01:37:37.010
<i>This is the debut of a Republic 
of Korea athlete in the finals.</i>

01:37:37.010 --> 01:37:39.680
<i>We are broadcasting live for
everyone.</i>

01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:42.670
<i>Compared to ordinary Olympians,</i>

01:37:42.690 --> 01:37:46.020
<i>these two athletes have had to
work harder and with greater
hardships.</i>

01:37:46.020 --> 01:37:47.510
<i>In their minds right now,</i>

01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:50.360
<i>they must be thinking of that
hard work they have put in.</i>

01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:53.520
<i>Athlete Go Du Yeong looks 
very nervous.</i>

01:37:53.530 --> 01:37:55.520
<i>Get ready!</i>

01:38:04.710 --> 01:38:05.540
<i>Begin!</i>

01:38:05.540 --> 01:38:07.530
<i>The match has begun.</i>

01:38:07.540 --> 01:38:11.210
<i>This is a match worthy of the
finals with aggressive attacks.</i>

01:38:11.210 --> 01:38:13.210
<i>It's a battle of nerves with 
these 2 athletes.</i>

01:38:13.220 --> 01:38:14.710
<i>There was no trip.</i>

01:38:15.390 --> 01:38:17.720
<i>Five technical attacks have not 
succeeded.</i>

01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:20.710
Violation!

01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:23.390
<i>Although dangerous, it was 
fortunately out of bounds.</i>

01:38:23.390 --> 01:38:26.560
<i>Unfortunately, that ippon seoi
nage was out of bounds.</i>

01:38:29.730 --> 01:38:31.060
<i>Du Yeong, get lower. </i>

01:38:31.070 --> 01:38:33.400
Grab tighter with your left arm!

01:38:37.570 --> 01:38:40.060
<i>Get ready!</i>

01:38:43.250 --> 01:38:44.910
<i>The 2 athletes are at the center 
of the ring.</i>

01:38:44.910 --> 01:38:46.420
<i>Begin!</i>

01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:48.080
<i>Waza-ari!</i>
[half point]

01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:52.750
<i>Unfortunately, that score was
taken away.</i>

01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:54.090
<i>Waza-ari!</i>

01:38:54.090 --> 01:38:56.030
<i>Out! Hold it!</i>

01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:03.590
Du Yeong, steady yourself. 
Are you alright?

01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:06.260
There's still time. It's okay.

01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:12.930
Then, Go Du Yeong has lost
half a point.

01:39:13.610 --> 01:39:17.270
Give me a cigarette, quickly.

01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:18.940
I don't have any.

01:39:18.950 --> 01:39:19.940
It's fine.

01:39:19.950 --> 01:39:21.940
I quit.

01:39:21.950 --> 01:39:24.780
Really.

01:39:24.790 --> 01:39:27.450
How did you quit so fast?

01:39:27.460 --> 01:39:29.620
Watch the match. The match.

01:39:32.300 --> 01:39:34.630
<i>Against the Turkish athlete,
Go Du Yeong still has hope.</i>

01:39:34.630 --> 01:39:35.960
<i>He's not afraid. </i>

01:39:35.970 --> 01:39:39.800
<i>He has risen through this entire
competition the same way.</i>

01:39:42.140 --> 01:39:45.970
<i>A more cautious and calm
response to this competition.</i>

01:39:45.980 --> 01:39:49.470
<i>With assistance of the referee, 
the 2 athletes move to the 
center of the ring.</i>

01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:51.140
<i>They have gripped each other's
uniform. </i>

01:39:51.150 --> 01:39:53.810
<i>Republic of Korea athlete, 
Go Du Yeong.</i>

01:39:53.820 --> 01:39:55.810
Grip him firmly, kid.

01:39:55.820 --> 01:39:57.810
Tightly.

01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:00.320
<i>Hey, Go Du Yeong!</i>

01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:03.160
<i>Are you afraid of hurting your
opponent?</i>

01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:04.990
<i>Do you think you're Hong Gil 
Dong?</i>

01:40:04.990 --> 01:40:06.830
<i>You have a brother, but you
can't call him your brother?</i>

01:40:06.830 --> 01:40:10.490
<i>That's how a jerk who ran away
from home was able to live.</i>

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.660
<i>You have to start buttons
from the neck, kid.</i>

01:40:14.670 --> 01:40:16.330
<i>Are you feeling sick?</i>

01:40:16.340 --> 01:40:18.170
<i>Who's sick?</i>

01:40:18.170 --> 01:40:20.010
<i>Where would I feel 
uncomfortable?</i>

01:40:20.010 --> 01:40:21.510
<i>Du Yeong.</i>

01:40:21.510 --> 01:40:25.500
<i>Start running!</i>

01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:28.510
<i>Trust me and run, you brat!</i>

01:40:30.020 --> 01:40:32.350
Do you have an older brother?

01:40:34.190 --> 01:40:36.350
I have one.

01:40:37.860 --> 01:40:39.520
<i>Begin!</i>

01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:46.030
<i>A great tomoe nage!</i>

01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:50.200
<i>A high technical score for 
Go Du Yeong!</i>

01:40:57.380 --> 01:40:59.370
Hold him! Hold him!

01:40:59.380 --> 01:41:02.550
<i>His opponent is struggling to 
break free, but cannot escape!</i>

01:41:02.550 --> 01:41:04.540
Don't let go, Du Yeong. 
Du Yeong.

01:41:04.550 --> 01:41:07.050
<i>Go Du Yeong is still holding on. </i>

01:41:07.060 --> 01:41:09.050
Press and hold! Press and hold!

01:41:10.730 --> 01:41:12.560
Please.

01:41:37.590 --> 01:41:40.420
<i>Waza-ari!</i>

01:41:42.090 --> 01:41:43.590
<i>And so...</i>

01:41:43.590 --> 01:41:45.580
<i>a victory!</i>

01:41:50.770 --> 01:41:52.600
<i>Athlete Go Du Yeong has won
the gold medal!</i>

01:41:53.940 --> 01:41:55.440
<i>Athlete Go Du Yeong!</i>

01:41:55.440 --> 01:41:57.600
Go Du Yeong well deserves
all of this applause.

01:41:57.610 --> 01:41:59.940
<i>He originally was to compete 
at the Rio Olympic Games,</i>

01:41:59.940 --> 01:42:02.270
<i>with high expectations of 
winning a medal.</i>

01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:06.610
<i>Now he has won gold at the Rio
Paralympic Games. It's almost
unbelievable! </i>

01:42:06.620 --> 01:42:09.280
<i>Although he experienced pain, 
he was able to bounce back.</i>

01:42:09.290 --> 01:42:13.780
<i>For continuing his athletic career,
Go Du Yeong really deserves our
warm applause.</i>

01:42:25.300 --> 01:42:28.130
What's wrong with him?

01:42:28.140 --> 01:42:30.130
Is he in shock?

01:42:42.150 --> 01:42:44.810
Hyeong.

01:42:52.330 --> 01:42:54.820
Hyeong!

01:42:56.170 --> 01:42:59.500
Hyeong!

01:43:06.340 --> 01:43:10.010
Hyeong!

01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:13.340
He's insane.

01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:27.020
Hyeong!

01:43:30.200 --> 01:43:32.530
<i>Hyeong!</i>

01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:37.370
<i>Hyeong!</i>

01:44:05.900 --> 01:44:07.400
Juice.

01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:09.740
Grape juice.

01:44:09.740 --> 01:44:12.070
It tastes like orange juice.

01:44:14.910 --> 01:44:17.070
If you speed dial #1 on your
phone,

01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:18.410
that's my number.

01:44:18.410 --> 01:44:20.410
I'm available 24 hours a day.

01:44:20.420 --> 01:44:23.080
If you need me, call me.

01:44:23.090 --> 01:44:25.920
Also,

01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:27.750
your brother wanted me to 
give this to you.

01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:30.250
your brother wanted me to
give this to you.

01:44:39.270 --> 01:44:42.600
=My dearest little brother, 
Du Yeong.=

01:44:42.610 --> 01:44:45.440
=In this unreal world, I hope 
you become a bridge.=

01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:47.270
=One that's so beautiful...=

01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:51.270
=No. What the heck? Aigoo.
Fuck.=

01:44:53.620 --> 01:44:55.110
=Well anyway,=

01:44:55.120 --> 01:44:57.610
=my dearest little brother, 
Du Yeong.=

01:44:57.620 --> 01:44:59.610
=I'm your brother.=

01:44:59.620 --> 01:45:03.460
=Don't be discouraged.
Don't be afraid.=

01:45:03.460 --> 01:45:05.450
=Keep your head up!=

01:45:05.460 --> 01:45:07.120
=Understand?=

01:45:07.130 --> 01:45:09.620
=A man needs the right 
clothes, okay?=

01:45:09.630 --> 01:45:11.460
=Don't just fiddle around, but
go out dressed properly.=

01:45:11.470 --> 01:45:13.960
=And don't ask if they're Jeon 
Ji Hyeon and get fooled again.=

01:45:13.970 --> 01:45:16.130
=You worry me to death.=

01:45:18.140 --> 01:45:20.630
=I, your brother...=

01:45:20.640 --> 01:45:22.980
=have to say some things 
to you.=

01:45:22.980 --> 01:45:24.640
=And that is,=

01:45:24.650 --> 01:45:27.810
=you are absolutely not alone.=

01:45:27.820 --> 01:45:30.810
=Your father, mom, and=

01:45:30.820 --> 01:45:34.810
=me, your brother, will always
be by your side, don't forget.=

01:45:34.820 --> 01:45:36.660
=And what else?=

01:45:36.660 --> 01:45:38.490
=Oh right, that.=

01:45:38.490 --> 01:45:40.330
=On behalf of our family, enjoy 
yourself and then come over.=

01:45:40.330 --> 01:45:41.990
=Okay? Have fun, you bastard.=

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:43.330
=If your life is meaningless,=

01:45:43.330 --> 01:45:46.320
=I will be very sad.=

01:45:46.340 --> 01:45:48.830
=And last of all,=

01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:51.670
=we will certainly see you 
again someday.=

01:45:59.350 --> 01:46:02.010
=I'll really miss you, 
little brother.=

01:46:02.020 --> 01:46:04.010
Hyeong.

01:46:42.390 --> 01:46:43.380
Oh, you're quite handsome.

01:46:43.390 --> 01:46:45.380
Oh, you're quite handsome.

01:46:46.730 --> 01:46:48.560
<i>You're a pretty arrogant guy.</i>

01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:51.060
<i>You're a pretty cocky guy.</i>
