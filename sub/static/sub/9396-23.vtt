00:00.323 --> 00:01.769
Previously on One Tree Hill.

00:01.819 --> 00:03.054
I have a right to my daughter.

00:03.703 --> 00:04.641
You’re not getting her.

00:10.605 --> 00:12.029
Petition for annulment?

00:12.592 --> 00:14.250
It’ll be like the marriage never happened.

00:14.994 --> 00:18.167
There’s... no way that he signed this.

00:18.290 --> 00:19.382
It’s over, Haley.

00:20.994 --> 00:21.932
Jake Jagielski.

00:23.048 --> 00:24.744
You have the right to remain silent.

00:25.747 --> 00:26.606
I love you.

00:27.236 --> 00:28.331
I love you, too.

00:29.042 --> 00:29.964
Did we have fun?

00:30.487 --> 00:31.382
You tell me.

00:37.127 --> 00:37.967
It’s okay, Deb...

00:39.274 --> 00:40.441
I’ll be here when you get out.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

00:49.502 --> 00:50.930
I’m coming home tomorrow, okay?

00:51.432 --> 00:52.682
Don’t come home, Haley.

00:52.800 --> 00:53.593
Nathan...

00:53.778 --> 00:55.170
Coz I don’t want you to.

01:48.270 --> 01:49.847
And Hansel said to Gretel...

01:51.189 --> 01:53.033
let us drop these breadcrumbs...

01:54.301 --> 01:56.443
so that together we find our way home.

01:57.872 --> 02:00.594
Because losing our way would be the most cruel of things.

02:02.776 --> 02:03.518
This year...

02:04.649 --> 02:05.806
I lost my way.

02:10.727 --> 02:13.144
And losing your way on a journey is unfortunate.

02:14.382 --> 02:16.419
But, losing your reason for the journey...

02:17.317 --> 02:18.817
is a fate more cruel.

02:21.566 --> 02:23.394
The journey lasted eight months.

02:24.408 --> 02:26.118
Sometimes I travelled alone...

02:28.243 --> 02:30.557
Sometimes, there were others who took the wheel...

02:32.170 --> 02:33.337
and took my heart.

02:35.564 --> 02:37.439
But when the destination was reached...

02:38.099 --> 02:39.789
it wasn’t me who arrived...

02:41.586 --> 02:42.861
it wasn’t me at all.

02:55.004 --> 02:57.924
And once you lose yourself, you have two choices:

02:58.024 --> 02:58.820
Bye!

03:03.269 --> 03:05.132
Find the person you used to be...

03:08.737 --> 03:10.586
or lose that person completely.

03:12.352 --> 03:15.715
Because, sometimes, you have to step outside of the person you’ve been.

03:16.376 --> 03:18.705
And remember the person you were meant to be.

03:19.643 --> 03:21.098
The person you wanted to be.

03:22.399 --> 03:25.806
- Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy...
- The person you are.

03:27.552 --> 03:30.395
Tree Hill student council is pleased to welcome-

03:30.605 --> 03:34.747
No. As president of the student council, I promised you guys a good time...

03:35.531 --> 03:38.177
I’m Brooke Davis and I’m an idiot, but, please welcome-

03:39.074 --> 03:40.961
Jimmy Eat World, that’s a great idea!

03:41.055 --> 03:42.299
Brooke, it’ll probably never happen.

03:42.413 --> 03:46.362
Peyton Elizabeth Sawyer, you got The Wreckers and Pelthead to come and play;

03:46.421 --> 03:48.741
you can totally land Jimmy Eat World and when you do,

03:48.791 --> 03:51.679
I promise I won’t break up with you to run off and join their tour.

03:54.854 --> 03:55.985
That’s it, isn’t it?

03:56.829 --> 04:00.679
That’s why your heart’s not totally in to finding a great band for the end of the school year.

04:01.146 --> 04:02.273
Haley and Nathan.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.267
Yeah. That, and-

04:07.618 --> 04:08.489
Jake.

04:09.482 --> 04:11.529
You’ve been calling my attorneys a lot.

04:12.073 --> 04:13.279
I thought I could help.

04:13.368 --> 04:15.282
Well, you just pissed them off.

04:17.468 --> 04:19.608
There are two tragedy’s in life:-

04:20.156 --> 04:22.692
one is to lose your heart’s desire.

04:23.189 --> 04:25.134
The other is to gain it.

04:25.630 --> 04:30.218
Now the little that Shaw realised at the time that his words would be the basis of your final.

04:30.883 --> 04:34.974
I’d like you to write an essay on the meaning of Shaw’s quote.

04:35.266 --> 04:37.288
It’s due on Monday...

04:37.392 --> 04:39.521
and then your school year will be over.

04:48.451 --> 04:51.133
I guess Haley’s not coming back after all, huh?

05:03.263 --> 05:04.277
Game to eleven?

05:05.142 --> 05:06.550
I’ll give you ten and the ball.

05:09.521 --> 05:10.370
Game.

05:11.327 --> 05:12.131
See?

05:13.293 --> 05:14.650
You’ll be back in no time.

05:14.788 --> 05:17.020
Shooting weak-ass jump shots: that’s your game.

05:17.716 --> 05:19.473
I can hardly jump, man.

05:20.041 --> 05:22.745
Look, I know you don’t wanna hear this, but if you blow off this English final,

05:22.811 --> 05:26.892
you’re not gonna even be eligible to shoot the... ‘weak-ass jump shots’.

05:29.529 --> 05:32.120
It’s about loss. I can help you if you want.

05:33.558 --> 05:35.207
You don’t think I can write about loss?

05:41.872 --> 05:43.086
Hey sexy!

05:44.480 --> 05:45.288
What’s wrong?

05:45.646 --> 05:48.566
I’m dead. I tanked my calculus final.

05:48.745 --> 05:50.786
Are you sure? Maybe you did okay.

05:50.860 --> 05:53.947
Erica, we hung out all week and I was totally unprepared.

05:54.263 --> 05:57.079
And you can’t exactly bluff your way through math, you know?

05:58.365 --> 06:00.351
God, my parents are gonna kill me.

06:04.673 --> 06:05.241
Hey.

06:06.219 --> 06:06.797
Hey.

06:07.964 --> 06:09.787
You wanna go on a road trip this weekend?

06:10.376 --> 06:11.396
Okay, where?

06:11.636 --> 06:13.367
New York, to see Haley.

06:13.982 --> 06:17.452
Alright, odd I know, coming from me, but we do have finals.

06:17.607 --> 06:18.451
The essay.

06:18.768 --> 06:22.823
I’ll bring my laptop. Whoever sits shotgun can do the typing; whaddaya say, huh?

06:24.237 --> 06:25.399
And why Haley?

06:25.757 --> 06:26.627
Why now?

06:26.796 --> 06:28.219
Because we started the year together...

06:29.070 --> 06:31.087
and I can’t end it without seeing her.

06:37.169 --> 06:39.746
Okay. I’ll go, we can talk.

06:39.821 --> 06:40.805
We need to talk.

06:41.112 --> 06:42.065
What’s wrong?

06:42.622 --> 06:46.186
Well, I don’t want you to be alarmed, but, my mother took a spill in New Zealand.

06:47.168 --> 06:48.551
That’s terrible.

06:49.386 --> 06:50.687
She’s asked me to come home.

06:51.286 --> 06:52.452
Well, you have to.

06:54.536 --> 06:57.348
And I don’t know how long for, coz there’s a bit more to it.

07:02.970 --> 07:05.160
I may have a problem coming back into the States;

07:05.934 --> 07:08.601
I’m not a citizen and, well,

07:10.240 --> 07:11.872
Dan’s trying to get me deported.

07:16.410 --> 07:17.300
Deported?!

07:17.694 --> 07:18.964
What is wrong with you?!

07:19.328 --> 07:21.556
Why can't you simply stay out of my life?!

07:21.831 --> 07:22.891
Why can’t you?

07:22.963 --> 07:26.710
Oh, please, I’ve been ignoring you for the last seventeen years!

07:26.784 --> 07:27.607
Have you?

07:28.695 --> 07:31.093
Coz you’ve been coming around quite a bit, Karen.

07:31.595 --> 07:33.808
I mean, with all your anger and outrage.

07:34.657 --> 07:35.917
Some would call it...

07:37.161 --> 07:38.036
passion.

07:38.401 --> 07:39.768
Don’t flatter yourself.

07:40.166 --> 07:42.148
Just back off Andy and Lucas.

07:42.214 --> 07:43.668
And leave my world alone.

07:49.633 --> 07:51.108
Isn’t that what this is really about?

07:51.856 --> 07:52.593
God!

08:10.461 --> 08:13.068
Next time... that’ll be your face!

08:21.301 --> 08:22.991
You guys ready for the summer?

08:26.567 --> 08:27.816
Yeah, me too.

08:27.998 --> 08:32.125
But, first, let’s give it up for the girl who made this happen tonight;

08:32.186 --> 08:34.716
my bestest friend: Peyton Sawyer.

08:38.640 --> 08:41.438
Peyton, Peyton, Peyton...

08:50.218 --> 08:51.079
Jake...

08:52.027 --> 08:53.889
You’ve been calling my attorneys a lot.

08:54.770 --> 08:55.857
I thought I could help.

08:56.067 --> 08:57.890
Well, you just pissed them off...

09:00.275 --> 09:01.268
at first.

09:02.645 --> 09:06.505
Then, you clearly weren’t going away, so they went over Nikki’s testimony line by line.

09:07.350 --> 09:08.666
And they found something.

09:09.793 --> 09:10.960
She lied, Peyton.

09:11.686 --> 09:14.693
She said that she’d been away at college but she wasn’t.

09:14.764 --> 09:16.229
She hadn’t been there in months.

09:16.398 --> 09:19.506
Well does, does that even matter, you know? Is that enough?

09:19.583 --> 09:21.775
Yeah, any lie is a lie under oath.

09:21.876 --> 09:24.135
Once my attorneys get a hold of her transcripts,

09:24.467 --> 09:26.071
the judge is gonna lift the court order;

09:26.141 --> 09:29.095
I’ll have sole custody of Jenny for a new hearing.

09:29.178 --> 09:31.471
And a chance to testify against all her other lies.

09:31.861 --> 09:34.978
That’s... that’s so great, Jake.

09:37.461 --> 09:38.685
When d’ya get out?

09:38.839 --> 09:40.199
A day or so, probably.

09:40.784 --> 09:42.730
And I’m gonna come find you as soon as I do.

09:43.856 --> 09:45.213
You did this, Peyton.

09:45.884 --> 09:49.201
You’ve given me hope; and I love you so much for it.

09:50.801 --> 09:52.914
Hey, hey, come on, don’t cry.

09:53.155 --> 09:55.423
Haven’t you ever cried when your happy?

10:08.213 --> 10:09.277
Come in, Nathan.

10:10.801 --> 10:11.986
How’d you know it was me?

10:12.293 --> 10:14.055
I can smell the confusion.

10:17.404 --> 10:19.205
That was a joke by the way.

10:20.793 --> 10:23.230
Nobody ever laughs at my jokes.

10:23.541 --> 10:24.919
That’s coz they’re not funny, Coach.

10:26.522 --> 10:29.246
Little bird told me you were moving back home.

10:29.600 --> 10:30.955
That little bird’s name Lucas?

10:32.953 --> 10:34.105
He cares about you.

10:35.973 --> 10:36.972
So do I.

10:38.774 --> 10:41.077
You’ve come quite a distance this year.

10:42.588 --> 10:45.460
I think moving out of that house has been good for you.

10:45.870 --> 10:46.608
Coach.

10:47.407 --> 10:48.169
Look at me.

10:48.985 --> 10:49.798
I’m a mess.

10:50.724 --> 10:52.803
Nah, you’re just a little bit broken.

10:53.632 --> 10:56.914
But it’s nothing that a summer at High Flyers couldn’t fix.

10:57.022 --> 10:59.048
- Could’ve fixed. 
- Still can.

10:59.489 --> 11:02.306
Dan Scott’s not the only one with pull in this town.

11:03.114 --> 11:07.524
The only thing that held you back as a player last season was heart...

11:08.218 --> 11:11.370
and I’ve watched that change over the past year.

11:12.330 --> 11:14.221
And I’ve been so proud of you.

11:17.487 --> 11:20.753
That camp has world class trainers.

11:21.460 --> 11:23.600
They can mend the physical part.

11:24.615 --> 11:26.881
I have a hunch, once that happens,

11:27.569 --> 11:29.370
the game will heal your heart.

11:31.116 --> 11:32.289
I dreamt about it;

11:32.954 --> 11:33.927
in the hospital...

11:34.517 --> 11:36.021
about going to that camp.

11:37.475 --> 11:38.366
I don’t know.

11:40.282 --> 11:41.808
My mom’s coming home soon.

11:42.878 --> 11:44.122
Gotta think about it.

11:48.069 --> 11:49.788
Promise me you’ll do that.

12:04.786 --> 12:07.909
How great is this? Dinner together, steaks on the grill.

12:07.976 --> 12:09.020
You not punching me.

12:12.005 --> 12:13.638
So I got some good news today.

12:13.731 --> 12:14.631
What’s that?

12:15.093 --> 12:17.171
Whitey thinks he can get me back into High Flyers.

12:19.193 --> 12:21.897
Well, as much as I love hearing you talk about basketball again,

12:22.496 --> 12:24.636
I really don’t think camp’s a smart play for you right now.

12:24.892 --> 12:27.412
- Dad, its High Flyers. 
- Exactly my point.

12:27.693 --> 12:30.555
You’re injured Nathan. You don’t want the scouts to see you like that.

12:30.707 --> 12:32.285
Plus, there’s your mother to consider.

12:34.221 --> 12:36.187
Listen, I don’t like to burden you with these things

12:36.234 --> 12:38.266
but you’re a man so I’m gonna be honest with you.

12:39.807 --> 12:42.832
Your mother’s pill addiction started when you moved out.

12:44.948 --> 12:47.048
Now, in no way does that mean you’re to blame, coz you’re not.

12:47.139 --> 12:50.606
But... she’s gonna be vulnerable when she comes home.

12:50.816 --> 12:52.709
And she’s gonna need you more than ever.

12:58.982 --> 13:03.068
Okay, guys, as student council president, I have one final duty

13:03.113 --> 13:04.849
before the summer begins and this is it.

13:04.925 --> 13:07.966
Tree Hill High, school is out and it is time to party!

13:08.065 --> 13:10.477
Please welcome Jimmy Eat World!

14:10.304 --> 14:11.313
So, it’s kinda weird;

14:11.850 --> 14:13.981
us... living under the same roof.

14:15.101 --> 14:16.233
Isn’t that weird.

14:17.231 --> 14:18.337
Yes it is.

14:18.756 --> 14:21.670
I mean, who would have thought this could have happened back when...

14:22.253 --> 14:23.272
we were together?

14:28.669 --> 14:30.619
You been talking to Peyton much?

14:31.076 --> 14:32.039
Little bit.

14:33.492 --> 14:35.530
I wish I was in her life more, you know?

14:38.635 --> 14:41.813
Guess I know what loss you’ll be writing about for your essay.

14:43.104 --> 14:45.073
I lost myself this year, Brooke.

14:46.272 --> 14:49.415
And what I did, I lost the people I truly care about.

14:51.321 --> 14:52.554
Oh, by the way, um...

14:53.763 --> 14:55.309
when we get to New York...

14:55.852 --> 14:58.653
I hope you’ll understand if we spend most of our time with Haley.

14:58.765 --> 15:02.738
It’s just... important that I focus on her today.

15:03.358 --> 15:04.095
You know?

15:04.767 --> 15:05.697
Of course.

15:07.575 --> 15:09.133
Everything else can wait.

16:29.089 --> 16:30.096
Lucas!

16:31.785 --> 16:34.024
Oh my gosh! Hi.

16:34.112 --> 16:38.196
Oh, well, it’s about time the tribal leaders came to collect their squaw.

16:38.300 --> 16:39.528
Oh, shut up, Chris.

16:39.886 --> 16:42.077
Yeah, shut up, Chris.

16:42.226 --> 16:43.336
Alright, I’m going.

16:45.723 --> 16:48.729
Oh... I see you couldn’t stay away from me.

16:48.831 --> 16:49.700
Out!

16:51.325 --> 16:54.452
I’m sorry. Oh, it’s good to see you too, Brooke.

16:55.292 --> 16:57.515
Yeah, you too, fugitive girl.

16:58.533 --> 17:00.002
Well, so what’re you guys doing here?

17:00.095 --> 17:01.758
We bought your English assignment.

17:01.837 --> 17:04.069
My- Oh my gosh, finals!

17:04.154 --> 17:06.423
Oh, god, that just feels like a totally different life.

17:07.390 --> 17:08.440
Let’s go, diva.

17:08.702 --> 17:11.869
Hey, Joey D, this is my friend Lucas and my friend Brooke.

17:11.952 --> 17:13.909
What’s up, guys? Ah, sorry I gotta drag her away

17:13.971 --> 17:16.515
but we’ve got three meetings and a satellite radio interview.

17:16.592 --> 17:17.906
- You ready? 
- Um...

17:19.319 --> 17:23.364
I’m just feeling a little... flu... ish.

17:23.676 --> 17:24.409
Haley...

17:24.518 --> 17:25.233
Yeah, I-

17:26.790 --> 17:28.551
It’s totally going around.

17:31.174 --> 17:32.223
Cover for me?

17:32.372 --> 17:34.758
Really, because I’m just, I’m sick as a dog here.

17:34.942 --> 17:37.191
No, no, wait Haley, no, no, wait... guys?

17:38.069 --> 17:39.140
I’m gonna be sick

17:39.509 --> 17:40.507
It’ll be okay.

17:40.799 --> 17:42.489
Dan can’t actually affect me legally.

17:42.626 --> 17:44.746
Yeah, but if you leave the country, then-

17:44.844 --> 17:48.842
Yes, it could create a bit of red tape that would hold up my return to the states.

17:52.401 --> 17:53.549
I’m gonna miss you.

17:55.110 --> 17:56.507
Unless you come with me.

17:58.468 --> 17:59.456
Bring Lucas.

18:00.111 --> 18:01.125
Take the summer...

18:02.569 --> 18:04.065
few years beyond that.

18:04.215 --> 18:06.277
Oh, Andy, I would love to.

18:06.379 --> 18:08.943
Honestly, there is nothing I would want more...

18:09.651 --> 18:10.542
but...

18:12.061 --> 18:15.682
with Deb’s troubles and the businesses and-

18:15.917 --> 18:16.706
Keith.

18:22.538 --> 18:24.545
Come on in! What do you think?

18:24.738 --> 18:27.228
No this is what I’m talking about.

18:27.421 --> 18:29.675
So... what-...

18:30.309 --> 18:31.656
what do you guys wanna do today?

18:31.758 --> 18:34.765
Wanna... take a limo to see the city? You wanna-

18:34.851 --> 18:36.833
I was thinking maybe we could just talk.

18:37.989 --> 18:38.916
Yeah.

18:40.479 --> 18:45.076
Um... I’m in New York city and my parents have resumed allowances;

18:45.153 --> 18:49.986
I would be crazy not to shop right now so I’m gonna leave you two alone. Okay?

18:50.447 --> 18:51.599
Good luck, see ya, bye.

19:01.164 --> 19:03.836
What you walked in on in the dressing room was innocent.

19:03.928 --> 19:04.589
Sure.

19:04.696 --> 19:07.436
It was, look, I’m not with Chris, okay?

19:08.265 --> 19:10.082
We were just kidding around like...

19:10.205 --> 19:11.727
We used to do?

19:15.458 --> 19:16.212
Yeah.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.215
I miss you so much.

19:31.966 --> 19:33.158
I’m sorry, Danny.

19:34.392 --> 19:36.123
Oh, this oughta be good.

19:36.472 --> 19:37.424
For what?

19:37.520 --> 19:39.549
Whatever you need me to be sorry for.

19:39.702 --> 19:42.088
Well, that’s a long list of screw-ups, Whitey.

19:42.309 --> 19:44.008
I take the blame for all of them...

19:44.331 --> 19:46.809
if it’ll help get Nathan into High Flyers.

19:47.203 --> 19:48.851
Ah, I see.

19:49.471 --> 19:51.264
You didn’t come here to apologise;

19:51.678 --> 19:53.234
you came to negotiate.

19:53.563 --> 19:55.533
I came to say I’m sorry.

19:56.225 --> 19:58.333
Dan, you were a great player...

19:58.917 --> 20:01.027
maybe I was a lousy coach...

20:01.550 --> 20:04.693
maybe I shoulda listened to you more and eased up a little bit.

20:05.220 --> 20:10.580
But... we can bury all that now and do what’s best for Nathan.

20:10.704 --> 20:12.900
And you think High Flyers is what’s good for him?

20:13.043 --> 20:15.389
I think... he needs to get away...

20:15.476 --> 20:18.444
and bathe himself in the game that you taught him to love.

20:19.341 --> 20:20.519
The game that...

20:21.158 --> 20:24.503
gave you all the hopes and dreams that it gave me.

20:25.783 --> 20:28.808
If saying ‘I’m sorry’ will help your son;

20:29.228 --> 20:32.745
a kid who, by the way, I think the world of...

20:33.760 --> 20:35.029
then I’m sorry.

20:35.500 --> 20:36.324
I was wrong.

20:37.518 --> 20:39.365
And I mean that sincerely.

20:42.940 --> 20:44.496
You know what, Whitey, you’re right.

20:46.709 --> 20:48.377
I was a great player...

20:50.133 --> 20:52.002
and you were a lousy coach.

20:52.981 --> 20:54.055
You still are.

21:03.481 --> 21:04.357
Erica.

21:04.567 --> 21:05.697
Come on, Mouth...

21:06.026 --> 21:07.890
give me some... mouth.

21:08.468 --> 21:10.066
You’re supposed to be helping me.

21:10.178 --> 21:13.558
Take it from someone who was obsessed with trying to be perfect:

21:13.957 --> 21:15.739
It’s not about perfect.

21:16.169 --> 21:19.092
It’s about living your life and doing the best you can.

21:21.535 --> 21:23.617
You’re pretty great, you know that?

21:23.735 --> 21:24.555
Yes.

21:25.451 --> 21:27.879
I’m so great... that I’ll make you a deal:

21:28.974 --> 21:31.018
for every sentence you write of your essay...

21:31.882 --> 21:33.402
I’ll give you a kiss.

21:35.093 --> 21:37.095
You think I could get an advance?

21:47.053 --> 21:48.532
Jake’s getting outta jail!

21:49.142 --> 21:51.343
Ah, that’s... that’s great, Peyton.

21:51.409 --> 21:54.257
He’s getting Jenny back, too, so I’m gonna go see him right now.

21:54.754 --> 21:55.757
Tell him I said ‘hey’.

21:59.412 --> 22:00.289
Hey, Nathan?

22:01.579 --> 22:03.135
I’m sorry I’m happy.

22:05.604 --> 22:07.318
Sometimes they come back, right?

22:14.400 --> 22:16.264
Jagielski, long window.

22:18.039 --> 22:19.468
Peyton, you don’t have to-

22:36.958 --> 22:37.900
Hi, Jake.

22:38.428 --> 22:39.973
How’s your sex life in there?

22:40.203 --> 22:41.386
What d’ya want, Nikki?

22:41.766 --> 22:43.404
I just came to say goodbye.

22:44.068 --> 22:45.811
You’re leaving before the hearing?

22:45.897 --> 22:48.525
Yeah... this game’s gotten old.

22:48.616 --> 22:50.157
Well, I guess it’s just as well.

22:50.607 --> 22:54.406
Once the judge hears my side of things, it’s not gonna matter if you’re there or not. You know it.

22:54.554 --> 22:56.251
Do you know how it feels, Jake?

22:56.572 --> 22:58.819
Knowing that you’ll never see your daughter again?

22:59.333 --> 23:01.416
Knowing that she’ll never be a part of your life?

23:02.275 --> 23:03.817
You’ll never see her walk...

23:04.428 --> 23:07.073
hear her laugh or watch her grow.

23:11.340 --> 23:12.470
Goodbye, Nikki.

23:13.812 --> 23:14.876
Goodbye, Jake.

23:17.258 --> 23:18.527
Oh, one more thing.

23:19.014 --> 23:19.782
Yeah.

23:19.879 --> 23:21.998
The next time you wanna hide my daughter...

23:22.327 --> 23:24.339
you’ve gotta do better that Florida.

23:35.982 --> 23:37.789
Do you know how it feels, Jake?

23:38.086 --> 23:40.031
Never to see your daughter again?

23:40.237 --> 23:41.482
Because you will.

23:41.645 --> 23:42.464
Nikki!

23:42.658 --> 23:44.539
Say goodbye to daddy, bunny.

23:45.439 --> 23:46.463
Forever.

23:47.446 --> 23:48.234
Nikki!

23:52.045 --> 23:52.890
Guard!

23:53.339 --> 23:54.026
Nikki!

23:54.256 --> 23:57.280
Somebody stop her! She’s got my baby! Nikki, come on!

23:57.517 --> 23:58.383
Nikki!

23:59.463 --> 24:00.436
Nikki!

24:04.153 --> 24:05.607
I’m guessing you’re here because of Nathan.

24:07.292 --> 24:08.382
Kind of.

24:09.206 --> 24:12.308
You know that he told me not to come home, right? You know that?

24:14.490 --> 24:18.232
Look, mostly, I’m here because of us, Haley.

24:19.836 --> 24:23.232
You know, I was... sitting in class... and...

24:24.187 --> 24:26.394
I looked over and saw your empty seat...

24:26.527 --> 24:27.762
and it struck me;

24:28.195 --> 24:30.163
that not too long ago, it was just you and me.

24:30.699 --> 24:31.524
Yeah.

24:33.250 --> 24:36.050
Suddenly, it felt wrong; that you weren’t there.

24:38.287 --> 24:39.948
You think I was wrong for leaving.

24:45.747 --> 24:46.910
Here’s what I think:

24:47.397 --> 24:49.849
you stood by me when I left the Rivercourt

24:51.219 --> 24:54.723
because a voice in my head told me that it’s what I had to do.

24:56.720 --> 24:58.220
So I’m here for you, Hales.

24:59.039 --> 25:00.519
And I always will be.

25:02.312 --> 25:05.152
Even... when I don’t understand it.

25:06.362 --> 25:07.262
Thanks, Luke.

25:09.459 --> 25:10.298
Thank you.

25:12.480 --> 25:13.417
Because...

25:14.691 --> 25:16.765
sometimes I don’t understand it either.

25:17.988 --> 25:20.012
Um, oh my god, Haley James?

25:20.242 --> 25:22.920
We just saw you play last night, could we get an autograph.

25:23.381 --> 25:24.184
Um...

25:25.552 --> 25:26.545
yeah, sure.

25:26.601 --> 25:27.462
Oh, thanks.

25:28.941 --> 25:30.554
- What’s your name? 
- Jennifer.

25:40.004 --> 25:42.633
Lucas and Haley aren’t back yet!

25:42.966 --> 25:45.372
But you can come in to the Devil’s lair.

25:45.534 --> 25:46.852
Drop your things...

25:47.152 --> 25:49.120
have sex with Chris Keller!

25:49.569 --> 25:50.588
Whatever.

25:52.114 --> 25:56.462
Here’s the deal: Brooke Davis thinks Chris Keller can self-serve Chris Keller;

25:56.554 --> 25:58.126
in other words, you can go-

25:58.233 --> 25:59.549
Oh hey, Brooke.

26:00.547 --> 26:01.817
What’s going on?

26:01.955 --> 26:03.600
She was just hitting on me.

26:05.125 --> 26:06.794
Hey, we missed you at the on-air.

26:07.137 --> 26:08.719
How’s the flu bug?

26:08.796 --> 26:11.726
Oh... it’ll pass, thanks. How’d it go?

26:11.826 --> 26:14.166
Well, without you, there’s more time to talk about me.

26:14.361 --> 26:15.463
It went great!

26:18.959 --> 26:19.681
What?

26:19.947 --> 26:24.540
I can’t breathe... there’s no room with Chris’ ego! Can we go?!

26:24.622 --> 26:26.675
Yes, let’s go. You can show me what you got.

26:26.772 --> 26:28.437
Hey, you can show me what you got, too.

26:30.259 --> 26:31.897
Lucas, it was good seeing you, buddy.

26:37.606 --> 26:40.125
Wow, yo-you angry or you just hitting on me?

26:40.229 --> 26:42.281
You ever tried singing with you jaw wired shut?

26:42.378 --> 26:43.515
I guess you’re angry.

26:43.643 --> 26:44.948
Do you think this is a joke?

26:45.549 --> 26:46.689
Because it’s not!

26:47.007 --> 26:49.444
You’re messing with people’s lives; people I care about!

26:49.521 --> 26:50.483
Messing how?

26:51.128 --> 26:52.557
You mean having sex with Haley?

26:55.240 --> 26:56.576
Coz I never did that.

26:57.288 --> 26:58.081
Okay?

26:58.420 --> 26:59.884
Is that what you needed to hear?

27:02.438 --> 27:03.867
How’s Nathan doing, anyway?

27:04.835 --> 27:05.833
Don’t go there.

27:06.366 --> 27:08.694
Oh, come on, man, you don’t think I think about the guy?

27:08.941 --> 27:10.728
I’m a song writer; I carry all that crap around.

27:10.800 --> 27:12.366
Well, then you should know how he's doing!

27:13.058 --> 27:14.204
He's terrible!

27:14.343 --> 27:15.248
Well, he should be.

27:15.433 --> 27:17.513
Haley’s a great girl. It would suck to lose her.

27:17.613 --> 27:19.924
And you don't feel the slightest bit guilty about that?!

27:20.025 --> 27:21.394
No, and I’ll tell you why:

27:21.547 --> 27:23.585
this is a one in a million chance we’re taking here.

27:23.660 --> 27:27.285
You gotta be selfish as hell; you’re either all in... or you’re out.

27:27.875 --> 27:29.456
You don’t think I’ve tried to talk to her about it?

27:29.529 --> 27:31.530
In the middle of the night on some random bus ride?

27:31.643 --> 27:34.557
Hell, man, I’ve talked to her a lot more than you have these past few months.

27:39.452 --> 27:42.124
Listen, Luke, I know she’s your friend, so...

27:42.216 --> 27:44.402
you can hate me for helping her chase her dream, but...

27:45.692 --> 27:48.191
I’m just trying to help her, now. You know?

27:48.964 --> 27:50.311
That same way you are.

27:51.104 --> 27:52.625
The rest, it’s up to her.

27:59.706 --> 28:02.041
Hey. Tell Brooke I said ‘hi’.

28:11.437 --> 28:12.731
You don’t lock your door at night.

28:14.227 --> 28:15.562
No one can hurt me.

28:15.788 --> 28:16.997
Nah, that’s where you’re mistaken.

28:19.203 --> 28:20.775
- Is that right? 
- That’s right.

28:21.252 --> 28:25.271
You see, I know about your little tax evasion scam...

28:25.357 --> 28:28.210
and more than that...I have proof of it.

28:30.159 --> 28:32.639
You know, I don’t have any idea what you’re talking about.

28:32.757 --> 28:33.662
Really?

28:35.039 --> 28:38.183
I see you’ve got a... new security system installed.

28:38.863 --> 28:39.812
Who installed it?

28:41.501 --> 28:43.523
Gotta diversify your portfolio, Dan.

28:44.127 --> 28:46.203
Security’s good business; I should know.

28:47.128 --> 28:49.823
I own the company that put your system in.

28:52.597 --> 28:53.724
I have your ledger.

28:54.618 --> 28:55.577
You’re bluffing.

28:56.094 --> 28:57.747
Well, we’ll see about that.

29:11.935 --> 29:15.616
You know, leave all this. I plan to redecorate when I buy this place, anyway.

29:45.006 --> 29:48.129
Oh yeah, sorry about today with the fans, earlier.

29:48.410 --> 29:51.288
- We were talking and, I just, I’m sorry- 
- It’s okay.

29:52.066 --> 29:55.977
It’s okay; actually, it was kinda cool to... see how far you’ve come.

29:56.570 --> 29:58.436
You know, I’m proud of you.

29:59.909 --> 30:00.743
But?

30:01.834 --> 30:03.375
It’s killing him, Haley.

30:05.199 --> 30:09.817
I guess I just don’t understand why it has to be one or the other: music or Nathan.

30:12.659 --> 30:15.689
I noticed you weren’t... wearing your wedding ring.

30:20.836 --> 30:22.700
It’s not because of the record label.

30:24.221 --> 30:26.385
And it’s not because I don’t love him.

30:28.274 --> 30:29.335
I just...

30:31.921 --> 30:33.845
I feel like I don’t deserve to.

30:37.179 --> 30:40.035
Things were so much simpler when it was just the two of us.

30:46.713 --> 30:47.920
But it’s not.

30:58.635 --> 30:59.786
- Hey. 
- Hey!

31:00.208 --> 31:01.345
How’d your essay go?

31:02.201 --> 31:03.700
I did the best I could.

31:48.507 --> 31:49.786
Nice try, Hargrove.

32:43.735 --> 32:47.399
Lucas... we’ve got to get out of town before I spot another sale.

32:48.544 --> 32:50.933
I’m gonna go find somebody to carry these.

32:57.001 --> 32:58.245
Here, um...

32:58.841 --> 32:59.996
it’s my English final.

33:01.190 --> 33:02.418
Pulled an all-nighter.

33:02.756 --> 33:05.772
Aren’t you... supposed to be trashing hotel rooms or something?

33:06.228 --> 33:10.882
You know, what kind of a rock star spends the entire night doing an English final?

33:10.980 --> 33:13.442
Well... I am still Tutor Girl.

33:13.692 --> 33:14.508
Right?

33:15.174 --> 33:16.182
Besides, it was...

33:17.159 --> 33:18.967
it was a pretty easy topic for me.

33:20.784 --> 33:21.905
So...

33:23.795 --> 33:26.231
maybe this means you’re coming back soon?

33:28.198 --> 33:28.956
No.

33:31.270 --> 33:32.970
I’m not coming home, Lucas.

33:35.642 --> 33:37.168
This is my life, now.

33:39.646 --> 33:41.111
Oh, um...

33:48.509 --> 33:51.080
I need you to... give this to Nathan for me, please.

33:52.806 --> 33:53.992
Please, Luke.

34:07.894 --> 34:10.004
So I guess this is goodbye?

34:11.202 --> 34:12.435
Yeah, I guess so.

34:18.973 --> 34:23.264
I... will always be there for you, Haley.

34:24.775 --> 34:26.966
You’ll always be my best friend.

34:39.925 --> 34:40.728
Hey.

34:41.900 --> 34:42.869
Come here.

34:44.011 --> 34:45.531
It’s all gonna be okay now.

34:45.654 --> 34:46.600
Peyton...

34:48.563 --> 34:51.071
- I have to go. 
- What? No, don’t.

34:51.623 --> 34:53.574
- Stay here. 
- Nikki found Jenny.

34:54.194 --> 34:55.105
What d’ya mean?

34:55.873 --> 34:57.508
She has her, Peyton.

34:57.686 --> 34:59.771
What? How?

34:59.966 --> 35:03.672
I don’t know how, okay? But I have to go, I have to find her.

35:03.765 --> 35:04.639
I’ll go with you!

35:04.782 --> 35:06.161
- No, you can’t. 
- But...

35:06.237 --> 35:07.040
Peyton.

35:08.613 --> 35:09.610
You can’t.

35:12.703 --> 35:13.999
Why not?

35:15.638 --> 35:21.349
I mean, what’s the point of school and grades and all of this if I’m not...

35:22.662 --> 35:26.098
God Jake, I can’t be without you, I love you!

35:30.088 --> 35:31.141
You’re meant for better.

35:31.208 --> 35:32.517
- I’m not! 
- You are.

35:33.194 --> 35:36.758
Hey, look, I don’t know, maybe I’ll find Jenny sooner than later. Maybe I’ll be back-

35:36.828 --> 35:38.979
You won't! You know you won’t!

35:40.702 --> 35:41.638
Come here.

35:44.575 --> 35:45.579
Listen to me.

35:47.130 --> 35:48.253
I need you...

35:49.793 --> 35:51.391
- to get past this. 
- No!

35:51.477 --> 35:54.237
I need you to forget about me and move on.

35:55.226 --> 35:56.009
Okay?

35:57.396 --> 35:59.449
You’re too amazing to carry this around.

35:59.870 --> 36:01.800
You’re too full of greatness and...

36:05.102 --> 36:06.705
I love you too much.

36:13.177 --> 36:14.109
But I have to go.

36:14.212 --> 36:15.019
No!

36:17.272 --> 36:19.146
You know, I can’t have Jenny be with Nikki.

36:34.222 --> 36:35.178
Jake!

36:41.548 --> 36:42.556
Thank you.

36:45.645 --> 36:47.865
You know, I coulda held you in my arms forever.

36:50.594 --> 36:52.714
It still wouldn’t have been long enough.

38:04.860 --> 38:06.637
You miss Haley, don’t you?

38:10.541 --> 38:11.794
You gonna be alright?

38:14.548 --> 38:16.851
Yeah, it’s just hard to let someone go, you know?

38:21.402 --> 38:23.297
It’s okay that you’re into Peyton.

38:25.723 --> 38:29.477
I’ve been avoiding it the whole trip, but I found the things in your closet;

38:29.774 --> 38:30.721
and its fine.

39:04.505 --> 39:06.613
I just wanted to say goodbye before I left.

39:06.931 --> 39:09.343
You’re leaving now? Tonight?

39:10.166 --> 39:11.401
I think it’s best.

39:12.373 --> 39:13.300
For mum...

39:14.744 --> 39:15.753
and for you.

39:22.516 --> 39:24.098
Andy...

39:29.817 --> 39:32.711
Oh, and... I need you to give this to Lucas.

39:33.637 --> 39:34.410
Of course.

39:46.908 --> 39:47.717
Andy.

39:51.362 --> 39:52.734
I love you, you know?

39:56.356 --> 39:57.481
I do.

39:58.116 --> 39:59.346
And I love you, Karen.

40:03.399 --> 40:06.056
But, somehow, it just... doesn’t seem to be enough.

40:25.408 --> 40:27.571
George Bernard Shaw once wrote:

40:28.131 --> 40:30.126
‘There are two tragedies in life:

40:30.700 --> 40:32.784
one is to lose your heart’s desire...

40:33.711 --> 40:35.549
the other is to gain it’.

40:36.793 --> 40:39.604
Clearly, Shaw had his heart broken once or twice.

40:54.311 --> 40:55.327
Where you been?

40:56.337 --> 40:57.452
Went to see a friend.

40:57.796 --> 40:59.920
Yeah? Anyone I know?

41:03.975 --> 41:04.989
Not really.

41:07.390 --> 41:08.838
You know you’re bleeding?

41:09.441 --> 41:10.686
Yeah.

41:12.024 --> 41:13.478
It should probably hurt, but...

41:14.093 --> 41:16.469
it’s kinda weird; I don’t feel anything.

41:19.449 --> 41:21.589
As far as I’m concerned, Shaw was a punk.

41:22.075 --> 41:24.572
Coz you know what? Tragedies happen.

41:25.581 --> 41:28.818
What’re you gonna do, give up? Quit? No.

41:30.194 --> 41:35.049
I realise now that when your heart breaks, you gotta fight like hell to make sure you’re still alive.

41:36.339 --> 41:37.343
Coz you are,

41:37.736 --> 41:39.017
and that pain you feel...

41:39.647 --> 41:40.655
it’s life.

41:41.173 --> 41:42.678
The confusion and fear...

41:43.486 --> 41:46.625
that’s there to remind you that somewhere out there is something better.

41:47.730 --> 41:49.861
And that something is worth fighting for.

42:01.505 --> 42:05.007
This year, I got everything I wanted and everything I wished for...

42:05.631 --> 42:09.358
but, in a way, I lost even more.

42:09.614 --> 42:11.843
Haley, the new tour posters are here.

42:14.068 --> 42:14.857
What’s this?

42:15.138 --> 42:19.322
Um... nothing, you know, just... stupid kid stuff.

42:21.713 --> 42:22.522
What d’ya think?

42:22.712 --> 42:23.556
Wow!

42:30.145 --> 42:31.395
Shaw was right:

42:31.897 --> 42:34.553
as we strain to grasp the things we desire...

42:34.672 --> 42:37.150
the things we think will make our lives better...

42:37.442 --> 42:40.406
money, popularity, fame...

42:40.693 --> 42:42.719
we ignore what truly matters...

42:42.828 --> 42:49.064
the simple things: like friendship, family, love.

42:50.195 --> 42:52.612
The things we probably already had.

42:54.588 --> 42:58.163
So, Mr. Shaw thinks that getting your hearts desire is a tragedy?

42:59.437 --> 43:00.926
I say he’s wrong.

43:01.459 --> 43:05.045
I mean, clearly, Shaw never kissed Erica Marsh.

43:27.040 --> 43:29.784
Yes, losing your heart’s desire is tragic.

43:31.376 --> 43:33.106
But gaining your heart’s desire...

43:34.460 --> 43:35.866
it’s all you can hope for.

43:38.995 --> 43:40.976
This year, I wished for love.

43:42.973 --> 43:47.202
To immerse myself in someone else and to wake a heart long afraid to feel.

43:51.995 --> 43:53.597
My wish was granted.

43:56.567 --> 44:00.064
And if having that is tragic... then give me tragedy.

44:06.368 --> 44:08.946
Because, I wouldn’t give it back for the world.

44:42.110 --> 44:42.956
Hey.

44:45.462 --> 44:46.315
Need some help?

44:46.618 --> 44:47.298
Nah.

44:47.713 --> 44:51.379
I figure if I leave all my stuff here, my parents are gonna have to let me come back for senior year.

44:53.673 --> 44:56.258
Look, are we ever… gonna talk about Peyton?

44:56.846 --> 44:58.127
And the stuff you found?

44:58.548 --> 45:02.647
It’s not a big deal. Actually, I was… kinda relieved.

45:04.435 --> 45:05.480
Relieved?

45:05.818 --> 45:07.293
I thought you might be into me.

45:07.738 --> 45:12.653
And… that would’ve ruined everything because we’ve become friends…

45:12.735 --> 45:14.374
and that’s exactly what I needed.

45:14.737 --> 45:16.918
And… it’s exactly what I want.

45:18.253 --> 45:22.616
But you seemed… upset… that I held onto all that stuff; you still do.

45:24.040 --> 45:26.324
Finding that stuff was kind of like…

45:27.611 --> 45:28.628
evidence.

45:29.535 --> 45:32.699
Reminded me of what happened… and how it happened.

45:34.490 --> 45:36.727
And I guess my heart just wasn’t ready for that.

45:49.765 --> 45:51.428
How you feeling, Ms. Scott?

45:52.079 --> 45:54.495
Coach! How you doing?

45:55.555 --> 45:57.609
Well, I guess you’re waiting for Danny.

45:57.774 --> 46:00.322
Uh, yeah, yeah, he… planned to pick me up.

46:00.747 --> 46:02.763
I was… hoping he’d bring Nathan.

46:03.958 --> 46:05.238
I lied.

46:05.753 --> 46:08.836
I had one of the girls at the office put you back an hour.

46:09.302 --> 46:12.154
I thought you and I might… have a talk.

46:17.842 --> 46:19.635
Any chance you could tap that thing?

46:20.228 --> 46:21.754
Sorry, we’re closed.

46:22.533 --> 46:25.640
Well, I hope so because if this is open, you’ve got problems.

46:26.168 --> 46:27.381
Where’re you taking this?

46:27.914 --> 46:29.895
- Over there, but… 
- I got it.

46:30.386 --> 46:31.876
Uh… thanks.

46:31.953 --> 46:33.059
No problem.

46:33.607 --> 46:35.707
If I had a dollar for every keg I’ve carried,

46:36.249 --> 46:37.729
I’d be a rich girl.

46:38.493 --> 46:39.686
Bartender?

46:40.028 --> 46:42.701
Only when I’m not killing people or saving the world.

46:43.294 --> 46:46.648
Well, if you’re looking for a job, I can put in a good word with the owner.

46:46.760 --> 46:48.865
Actually, I’m looking for Peyton.

46:49.468 --> 46:50.611
Oh, um…

46:50.882 --> 46:52.044
I’m Peyton.

46:53.360 --> 46:56.176
Oh. I’m Ellie.

46:56.376 --> 46:58.966
I write a column for Alternative Press. You know it?

46:59.771 --> 47:01.844
Know it? I read it cover to cover.

47:02.049 --> 47:03.087
Which column?

47:03.447 --> 47:04.958
Actually, it’s a new one.

47:05.141 --> 47:09.651
But I heard some high school girl got The Wreckers and Jimmy Eat World to play her club night.

47:09.918 --> 47:12.170
And I wanted to know more. Whaddaya say?

47:12.607 --> 47:16.835
I’d say I’m really flattered, but… I think last night was my final show.

47:17.967 --> 47:20.225
Well, I assume there’s a reason for that?

47:21.572 --> 47:22.391
Yeah.

47:22.749 --> 47:24.941
Sounds like the makings of a great story.

47:25.729 --> 47:26.974
No thanks.

47:27.204 --> 47:28.990
But it was really nice to meet you.

47:30.005 --> 47:32.175
It’s nice to meet you too, Peyton.

47:48.453 --> 47:51.990
Luke, find the combination and Dan is… finished.

48:38.578 --> 48:39.326
Hey.

48:40.840 --> 48:41.722
What’s up?

48:42.463 --> 48:43.419
Nothing, you?

48:44.875 --> 48:46.681
I thought you said you were done spying on him.

48:47.685 --> 48:48.812
I am.

48:49.635 --> 48:50.716
Then what’s in the bag?

48:56.027 --> 48:58.469
Just… bringing this back to you.

48:59.543 --> 49:01.028
You gave me your word, Luke.

49:01.791 --> 49:04.212
I know, and I’m done.

49:05.878 --> 49:06.815
I promise.

49:26.067 --> 49:27.535
Giving up on your dreams?

49:28.734 --> 49:29.506
Mom.

49:29.654 --> 49:31.022
Oh, my boy.

49:32.307 --> 49:34.344
I have missed you.

49:35.845 --> 49:37.449
It’s gonna be okay now, mom.

49:37.708 --> 49:38.539
Yeah.

49:39.966 --> 49:41.933
So, what’s all this about?

49:43.023 --> 49:44.651
Nathan’s moving home, Deb.

49:48.831 --> 49:50.334
We’re gonna be a family again.

49:53.687 --> 49:54.845
Welcome home.

50:28.413 --> 50:30.302
- Hi-O! 
- Oh God!

50:31.588 --> 50:32.442
What?

50:33.383 --> 50:34.832
You scared the hell outta me.

50:35.810 --> 50:38.713
You don’t know anybody who has IM named ‘WATCHMEWATCHU’, do you?

50:38.827 --> 50:42.354
Hmm... sounds pervy. Sadly no, why?

50:43.133 --> 50:45.487
Doesn’t matter. Sup?

50:45.581 --> 50:47.381
It’s actually what I came to ask you.

50:47.531 --> 50:51.754
Couldn’t find you at the club last night; figured maybe you stayed in with Jake.

50:51.827 --> 50:53.527
Jake’s gone, Brooke.

50:55.447 --> 50:56.862
Nikki has Jenny.

50:57.736 --> 51:00.361
Oh, Peyton, come here. What happened?

51:02.707 --> 51:07.458
I can’t, coz if you hug me, then I’m gonna start… bawling again, so…

51:09.051 --> 51:10.877
some summer break, huh?

51:12.993 --> 51:15.389
Well… I mean, he’s coming back, right?

51:15.486 --> 51:18.958
He’ll… find Jenny and then he can slap Nikki

51:19.034 --> 51:22.270
and then he’s coming right back to you! I just know it.

51:22.649 --> 51:23.586
Thanks.

51:25.183 --> 51:28.103
Okay, I’m sorry, I’m changing the subject;

51:28.178 --> 51:31.424
how was your road trip with Lucas.

51:31.528 --> 51:34.283
Um… fine.

51:34.419 --> 51:37.266
Fine? Is this gonna get sexual?

51:38.598 --> 51:40.653
I don’t know, that’s kind of up to you.

51:40.841 --> 51:41.593
What?

51:42.577 --> 51:45.397
It can wait. You’re head is spinning.

51:46.498 --> 51:50.128
Brooke, considering you’re leaving, tomorrow, it can’t wait.

51:50.722 --> 51:51.644
Spill!

51:52.112 --> 51:53.016
Okay.

51:54.710 --> 51:58.310
Um… I was snooping through Lucas’ things; kind of on purpose,

51:58.356 --> 52:01.448
and found a bunch of your stuff that he saved and I think he’s still into you.

52:03.803 --> 52:08.668
Like I said: bad timing… seeing that Jake just left, or maybe good timing?

52:10.097 --> 52:13.163
Brooke, I’m sorry.

52:13.491 --> 52:15.652
I know you have feelings for Lucas.

52:16.348 --> 52:17.869
Phantom feelings.

52:17.992 --> 52:20.986
Like… when you lose a leg and try to scratch it.

52:21.437 --> 52:25.657
Lucas was my… gangrene infected, amputated limb.

52:25.979 --> 52:26.870
Really?

52:28.585 --> 52:31.410
I was so insecure when I was with him, Peyton…

52:31.600 --> 52:35.630
and this whole thing just reminded me that I don’t wanna be that girl again.

52:36.373 --> 52:37.401
I won’t be.

52:40.550 --> 52:43.444
Marcus, I don’t understand, he was supposed to be there by now.

52:44.426 --> 52:47.672
Well… can you leave him another message in case he checks in?

52:48.010 --> 52:49.173
Andy Hargrove.

52:49.776 --> 52:50.616
Thanks.

53:08.711 --> 53:09.586
Karen?

53:10.369 --> 53:11.870
Oh my gosh, Deb!

53:13.147 --> 53:14.214
Welcome back!

53:15.070 --> 53:17.107
You look like you just saw a ghost.

53:17.506 --> 53:18.894
Well, I think I did.

53:19.508 --> 53:20.604
How you feeling?

53:20.691 --> 53:25.253
Uh, good. Great actually. I just… I need to keep busy.

53:25.357 --> 53:28.351
Are you sure? I mean… you don’t wanna take some time?

53:28.433 --> 53:30.066
Uh, no, no, absolutely not.

53:30.143 --> 53:32.206
Well, okay. Let’s talk.

53:32.278 --> 53:33.133
Okay.

53:40.833 --> 53:42.703
You’re not going away, are you?

53:44.166 --> 53:45.334
Not this time.

53:46.650 --> 53:48.017
That’s a rad jacket.

53:48.385 --> 53:49.291
Thanks.

53:49.799 --> 53:51.555
I stole it from Courtney Love.

53:51.847 --> 53:52.553
Really?

53:52.640 --> 53:55.037
Yeah. She was being a bitch.

53:55.149 --> 53:56.173
So I took it.

53:57.484 --> 53:58.400
Have a seat.

53:59.559 --> 54:05.370
So, the editors at THUD are thrilled about your story and they say I have to talk to you.

54:06.172 --> 54:07.554
Is it that bad?

54:07.781 --> 54:11.257
Well, if there’s no House of Freaks at TRIC, there’s no story.

54:12.471 --> 54:15.487
And what about the rest of your life? Is it that bad?

54:17.201 --> 54:18.650
What do you know about it?

54:20.000 --> 54:25.573
Well… your eyes are puffy which, from experience, screams textbook crying eyes.

54:25.665 --> 54:30.181
You have your hair up so you’re probably not planning on impressing any boys today.

54:30.246 --> 54:35.209
I’d say you’re nursing a hell of a broken heart; and not the school-girl crush kind, the real thing.

54:38.015 --> 54:40.350
Um… okay.

54:40.433 --> 54:44.762
Uh… well, I mean, I started TRIC to escape it all, you know, and…

54:44.854 --> 54:48.255
bring people together; let the music drown out the white noise in life.

54:48.341 --> 54:49.940
And tell me about your life.

54:50.133 --> 54:51.961
What is the white noise made of?

54:52.049 --> 54:55.187
Oh, god, I mean… everything unnecessary…

54:55.269 --> 55:00.620
like… cliques and… greed and popularity and harassment-

55:00.707 --> 55:02.330
The song remains the same.

55:02.412 --> 55:04.138
Yeah, as far as I can tell, it does.

55:10.057 --> 55:11.787
Looks like we’re both getting better.

55:12.790 --> 55:14.516
You love this game, don’t you?

55:15.500 --> 55:17.107
Depends on what day you ask me.

55:17.521 --> 55:20.332
Nah, you loved it every day since you could hold a ball.

55:21.551 --> 55:23.962
So… why aren’t you going to the camp?

55:24.925 --> 55:26.143
You talk to dad?

55:26.585 --> 55:27.710
Talked to Whitey.

55:28.269 --> 55:30.674
He said you’re staying because of me.

55:31.095 --> 55:32.892
Whitey also drinks a lot, mom.

55:34.638 --> 55:35.652
Then you’ll go.

55:38.083 --> 55:39.169
Look, uh…

55:40.879 --> 55:42.588
dad told me about the pills;

55:42.922 --> 55:44.863
about how you started taking them because…

55:44.939 --> 55:46.131
Because what?

55:46.931 --> 55:48.118
Because I moved out.

55:48.206 --> 55:49.885
Is that what he told you?

55:50.567 --> 55:53.233
I took the pills because you moved away?

55:53.772 --> 55:54.666
Yeah.

55:56.163 --> 55:57.704
That son of a bitch!

55:58.452 --> 55:59.915
Nathan, listen to me;

56:00.370 --> 56:03.869
you misunderstood me when I said that I wanted us to be a family again.

56:03.955 --> 56:08.768
I want us to be a family again; you and me.

56:09.972 --> 56:11.451
Will you come with me?

56:12.792 --> 56:13.714
Yeah.

56:15.342 --> 56:17.263
But what’re we gonna do about dad?

56:17.744 --> 56:19.500
Huh, he won’t just let us go.

56:19.612 --> 56:22.146
We’re getting out, Nathan, together.

56:22.960 --> 56:25.342
Your father can burn in hell for all I care.

56:50.621 --> 56:52.488
Where is the combination?

57:21.028 --> 57:21.779
Damn!

57:52.602 --> 57:53.883
Game over.

58:02.510 --> 58:03.287
Brooke?

58:03.539 --> 58:09.094
Um… I found it while I was packing. Just… kind of felt like I should try it on.

58:11.003 --> 58:11.916
Can we talk?

58:12.412 --> 58:13.236
Yeah.

58:23.594 --> 58:27.290
I can’t let you leave tomorrow without saying this.

58:28.622 --> 58:31.428
Lucas, if this is about Peyton, I don’t-

58:31.596 --> 58:34.306
I love you, Brooke.

58:35.181 --> 58:37.726
And, I know: just friends, but…

58:38.565 --> 58:41.053
I need you to know how I feel.

58:45.374 --> 58:47.079
I can’t believe I’m hearing this.

58:47.490 --> 58:48.826
Brooke, don’t go.

58:49.072 --> 58:53.153
I can’t believe… you would walk into my bedroom -

58:53.507 --> 58:56.113
formally your bedroom; but that’s besides the point -

58:56.409 --> 59:01.047
and knowing our history… blurt out that you love me.

59:05.143 --> 59:06.737
Coz I was hoping you would.

59:16.202 --> 59:16.971
Brooke?

59:17.933 --> 59:19.449
It took you long enough.

59:40.497 --> 59:42.201
This has gotta be a dream.

01:00:00.399 --> 01:00:02.528
Lucas! Do not make me join you!

01:00:02.663 --> 01:00:04.423
Uh… a little privacy here.

01:00:04.525 --> 01:00:08.535
No, you have been in the shower forever. By the time I even get in, the water is gonna be...

01:00:08.790 --> 01:00:11.800
...cold! Are you taking a cold shower!?

01:00:11.882 --> 01:00:14.857
- No, the hot water just- 
- Gross! You are.

01:00:14.934 --> 01:00:17.776
You know what, next wet dream, tell Peyton I said ‘hi’.

01:00:17.899 --> 01:00:18.699
Eww!

01:00:22.916 --> 01:00:25.446
Mom, can we get a lock on the bathroom door?

01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:27.740
Going somewhere?

01:00:29.261 --> 01:00:30.550
Like New Zealand?

01:00:32.004 --> 01:00:33.577
You know, Keith was right.

01:00:35.534 --> 01:00:39.701
He once told me that I… I hide my heart and I run from love.

01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:42.654
I did that with Andy.

01:00:44.616 --> 01:00:48.849
I’m just being dumb; we don’t even have money for two plane tickets to New Zealand, right?

01:00:51.046 --> 01:00:52.503
We have enough for one.

01:00:54.318 --> 01:00:56.959
Look… mom, I love you…

01:00:57.205 --> 01:01:00.993
but… I’m a big boy now and I’ll be fine on my own.

01:01:04.327 --> 01:01:05.818
It’s your journey to take.

01:01:13.564 --> 01:01:16.856
If I thought he was coming back soon, I wouldn’t even consider it.

01:01:16.999 --> 01:01:18.597
- I know. 
- But you’re…

01:01:20.855 --> 01:01:24.879
Dan… is pulling the strings as usual.

01:01:29.334 --> 01:01:30.523
Not for long.

01:01:38.456 --> 01:01:39.528
Let me ask you something:

01:01:39.605 --> 01:01:42.302
are you not helping me move you because it brings back bad memories

01:01:42.353 --> 01:01:44.387
or because you’re a lazy pile of crap?

01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:47.515
You mean… bad memories like these?

01:01:51.170 --> 01:01:52.240
Oh god.

01:01:52.668 --> 01:01:54.191
We started off the school year this way.

01:01:54.274 --> 01:01:55.575
Yeah, don’t remind me.

01:01:55.922 --> 01:01:58.068
- You were never happier. 
- You were never hornier!

01:01:58.159 --> 01:01:59.645
Oh yeah? You want some more of that magic?

01:01:59.721 --> 01:02:00.407
- Don’t- 
- Come here.

01:02:00.474 --> 01:02:01.174
- No- 
- Come on.

01:02:01.246 --> 01:02:02.926
Okay, stop it! Ah!

01:02:04.332 --> 01:02:04.794
Come on.

01:02:04.892 --> 01:02:07.011
- Will you stop! 
- Well, well!

01:02:07.155 --> 01:02:09.726
First Lucas, then Jake, now Nathan.

01:02:09.843 --> 01:02:11.455
I guess slutty’s in season!

01:02:11.804 --> 01:02:13.770
And why is bitch being a Brooke?

01:02:13.863 --> 01:02:16.520
I don’t know, maybe because I’m leaving for the summer;

01:02:16.591 --> 01:02:20.684
possibly forever and my best friend is off… giving interviews and

01:02:20.765 --> 01:02:25.290
having… pseudo-innocent foreplay with kinda married guys.

01:02:26.572 --> 01:02:27.477
Okay.

01:02:29.868 --> 01:02:31.461
Hi, Alternative Press?

01:02:31.578 --> 01:02:32.760
Editorial please.

01:02:33.211 --> 01:02:34.384
What’re you doing?

01:02:34.742 --> 01:02:37.989
I know that you are needy right now and so I’m postponing the interview

01:02:38.050 --> 01:02:40.365
until after my best friend is gone for the summer.

01:02:42.367 --> 01:02:44.235
Hi, Ellie Harp, please.

01:02:45.141 --> 01:02:47.850
Oh, okay, um… maybe I have the name wrong.

01:02:47.952 --> 01:02:51.056
She’s doing an article on Peyton Sawyer and the nightclub TRIC.

01:02:51.501 --> 01:02:53.832
Oh, are you sure?

01:02:55.290 --> 01:02:56.703
Okay, thanks.

01:02:57.741 --> 01:02:58.613
You okay?

01:02:58.685 --> 01:03:01.399
The woman said that she knows all the columnists at the magazine

01:03:01.454 --> 01:03:04.219
and she’s never heard of Ellie Harp or the story.

01:03:04.705 --> 01:03:07.388
So… maybe you have the wrong magazine?

01:03:08.070 --> 01:03:09.328
Yeah, maybe.

01:03:13.272 --> 01:03:15.028
Every transaction is listed.

01:03:15.248 --> 01:03:18.503
The actual sale price and the price Dan declared to the government.

01:03:18.612 --> 01:03:21.269
He’s done it a thousand times Deb; it’s a federal offence.

01:03:21.802 --> 01:03:22.739
Prison?

01:03:25.115 --> 01:03:28.503
So… why are you bringing this to me? He’s my husband.

01:03:29.247 --> 01:03:31.121
And he’s my father.

01:03:31.673 --> 01:03:35.201
But… I figured you could use it to get away from him.

01:03:35.472 --> 01:03:36.569
To get out.

01:03:37.602 --> 01:03:39.200
You’d do that for me?

01:03:39.646 --> 01:03:43.072
Yeah, and for Nathan… and Keith…

01:03:43.291 --> 01:03:45.133
and everybody else he’s hurt.

01:03:46.429 --> 01:03:49.092
So… this is it.

01:03:49.650 --> 01:03:53.388
This is the smoking gun that can bring down Dan Scott.

01:03:53.884 --> 01:03:54.908
Yep.

01:04:13.612 --> 01:04:15.301
Looking for something?

01:04:25.087 --> 01:04:26.053
Where is it?

01:04:26.572 --> 01:04:27.220
Where’s what?

01:04:27.291 --> 01:04:29.105
Don’t play dumb with me! Where’s the ledger?!

01:04:29.397 --> 01:04:34.215
Oh, you mean the ledger that exposes my husband’s illegal activities over several years?

01:04:34.313 --> 01:04:35.977
Tell me that ledger doesn’t exist, Dan.

01:04:36.062 --> 01:04:37.385
You don’t see the big picture, Deb.

01:04:37.471 --> 01:04:39.038
Oh, I think I do.

01:04:39.146 --> 01:04:40.671
Just give me the damn book!

01:04:40.958 --> 01:04:44.604
You told Nathan that my addiction was his fault.

01:04:44.885 --> 01:04:46.251
What’re you talking about?

01:04:46.328 --> 01:04:48.869
You knew I wouldn’t come back unless Nathan was living here.

01:04:48.976 --> 01:04:50.879
Take another pill, Deb? You’re delusional.

01:04:50.973 --> 01:04:53.420
No, I was delusional:

01:04:53.502 --> 01:04:55.812
loving you, thinking you’d change.

01:04:56.144 --> 01:05:02.939
But I’ve got clarity now, Danny-boy, and I finally see you for the pathetic, broken man you are.

01:05:04.055 --> 01:05:05.329
Lemonade?

01:05:05.928 --> 01:05:09.358
You know, a guy like me works his entire life trying to build something.

01:05:10.143 --> 01:05:14.345
Trying to make his mark in the world; to provide for his family,

01:05:15.097 --> 01:05:19.323
working hour after hour to turn the seed of an idea into a successful business.

01:05:19.383 --> 01:05:20.710
A fraudulent business.

01:05:20.801 --> 01:05:24.013
A fraudulent business owned by my wife.

01:05:25.897 --> 01:05:28.949
You know, it’s a shame that ignorance isn’t an excuse, Deb,

01:05:29.416 --> 01:05:32.880
because when you turn in that ledger, both of Nathan’s parents will be felons.

01:05:33.398 --> 01:05:35.869
Hell, you’ll just go from one institution to the next.

01:05:35.968 --> 01:05:38.933
Today: the drunk tank, tomorrow: prison.

01:05:39.649 --> 01:05:40.944
You bastard.

01:05:41.169 --> 01:05:45.276
No, Deb, the bastard would’ve been Nathan; that is, if I wouldn’t have married you.

01:05:45.352 --> 01:05:47.180
And made us all so happy.

01:05:49.725 --> 01:05:51.478
Where’s the ledger, Deb?

01:06:09.705 --> 01:06:10.978
Hello?

01:06:11.085 --> 01:06:12.924
You can run but you can’t hide.

01:06:12.995 --> 01:06:13.927
Who is this?

01:06:14.015 --> 01:06:14.676
It’s Ellie.

01:06:14.751 --> 01:06:16.058
Where’d you get this number?

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:17.260
Well, I-

01:06:17.327 --> 01:06:19.068
Leave me alone and don’t call me!

01:06:25.583 --> 01:06:26.379
Mom?

01:06:28.489 --> 01:06:29.333
Nate.

01:06:29.748 --> 01:06:31.760
What’s going on? You sounded freaked out on the phone.

01:06:32.155 --> 01:06:34.222
We’re gonna have to stay here for a while.

01:06:34.746 --> 01:06:35.555
What happened?

01:06:35.642 --> 01:06:39.062
Nathan, I’m so sorry. It’s just… your father has done some things.

01:06:39.342 --> 01:06:41.668
- What things? 
- Nothing that concerns you.

01:06:42.308 --> 01:06:44.182
But Lucas found something.

01:06:44.796 --> 01:06:45.528
Lucas.

01:06:45.615 --> 01:06:47.201
He was trying to help us.

01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:51.263
But it-it doesn’t matter now. What does matter is that you remember I love you…

01:06:51.555 --> 01:06:53.264
and I always will.

01:06:53.987 --> 01:06:55.148
We were gonna get out.

01:06:55.609 --> 01:06:58.845
And we still are, okay? I promise you.

01:06:58.933 --> 01:07:01.892
But… for now, that has to be our secret.

01:07:02.859 --> 01:07:05.364
I want you to go to High Flyers.

01:07:05.461 --> 01:07:08.267
Forget it! I’m not leaving you here alone with Dan!

01:07:08.343 --> 01:07:09.890
Nathan, I’ll be fine!

01:07:10.099 --> 01:07:14.196
You go to that camp and don’t look back for a second, do you understand me?

01:07:15.870 --> 01:07:17.257
It has to end.

01:07:17.887 --> 01:07:20.549
Yes… it does.

01:07:37.213 --> 01:07:38.822
Ah, here we go again.

01:07:38.909 --> 01:07:40.952
Oh, don’t mind me; I just need your measurements.

01:07:41.039 --> 01:07:44.383
Alright, I’ll play along; my measurements for what?

01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:46.688
For the pine box they’re gonna put you in.

01:07:47.664 --> 01:07:49.523
I’m about to bury you, Whitey.

01:07:50.296 --> 01:07:54.684
You crossed the line, Whitey; talking to Deb, meddling with Nathan.

01:07:55.089 --> 01:07:59.180
You know, I occupy a seat on the school board; I think we’re gonna make some changes next season.

01:07:59.256 --> 01:08:00.798
Don’t you threaten me!

01:08:00.890 --> 01:08:02.462
Oh, it’s not a threat!

01:08:02.554 --> 01:08:04.362
You’ve got some health concerns, don’t you?

01:08:04.684 --> 01:08:07.572
Bad eyes and all; that coupled with the first round playoff loss.

01:08:07.643 --> 01:08:08.544
Which you coached!

01:08:08.625 --> 01:08:09.983
Because you were ill!

01:08:11.038 --> 01:08:13.746
You know, it’s a shame you never won the state title, Whitey,

01:08:14.048 --> 01:08:16.081
because as far as I’m concerned…

01:08:16.291 --> 01:08:18.001
you’re never gonna coach again!

01:08:18.099 --> 01:08:20.151
You better be careful, son.

01:08:20.386 --> 01:08:23.596
You mess with my livelihood, I’ll mess with yours.

01:08:23.725 --> 01:08:25.594
Speaking of threats.

01:08:26.014 --> 01:08:27.852
You know, most people…

01:08:27.970 --> 01:08:32.921
when they go they leave the world a lesser place, but not you.

01:08:33.228 --> 01:08:36.715
No, the world won’t even blink.

01:08:36.801 --> 01:08:39.162
Well, you’d know, wouldn’t you, Whitey?

01:08:40.511 --> 01:08:43.197
You’re playing with fire, Danny…

01:08:43.417 --> 01:08:46.165
and you are about to get burned!

01:08:46.252 --> 01:08:48.198
Bring it on, old man.

01:08:57.805 --> 01:09:00.450
Okay, I’ve spoken with Deb so she’s gonna look after things.

01:09:00.549 --> 01:09:02.264
And all my numbers are near the phone.

01:09:02.371 --> 01:09:04.122
- Oh, and if Keith calls- 
- Mom…

01:09:05.499 --> 01:09:06.627
go.

01:09:08.004 --> 01:09:09.497
If you need anything…

01:09:10.215 --> 01:09:12.924
well I’ll only be… half a world away.

01:09:17.327 --> 01:09:19.037
Go find happiness, mom.

01:09:19.779 --> 01:09:20.752
I love you.

01:09:24.109 --> 01:09:25.232
I love you, too.

01:10:51.848 --> 01:10:53.583
Oh, he still hasn’t checked in?

01:10:54.366 --> 01:10:56.339
Oh-no, no message, thank you.

01:11:30.155 --> 01:11:31.524
- What’s going on? 
- Where is it?

01:11:32.721 --> 01:11:33.694
Where’s what?

01:11:33.779 --> 01:11:35.773
Whatever it is you have on my dad, where is it?

01:11:35.916 --> 01:11:36.891
Nathan, look.

01:11:37.001 --> 01:11:38.793
Lucas, you said you were done!

01:11:42.377 --> 01:11:44.226
Nate, you don’t wanna do that!

01:11:49.945 --> 01:11:52.346
I wanted to tell you… Nate.

01:11:53.105 --> 01:11:55.480
I was just… waiting for the right time.

01:11:55.971 --> 01:11:57.159
You went to see her.

01:11:58.758 --> 01:12:00.379
You’re just full of lies, aren’t you?

01:12:00.472 --> 01:12:01.148
Nathan!

01:12:01.234 --> 01:12:03.533
You don’t wanna push this right now, Lucas! Trust me!

01:12:07.695 --> 01:12:09.811
So the prodigal son returns.

01:12:12.110 --> 01:12:13.451
You looking for this?

01:12:15.407 --> 01:12:16.558
Or, maybe,

01:12:18.519 --> 01:12:19.595
you’re looking for this.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.690
Go on, take a closer look.

01:12:35.231 --> 01:12:36.809
How stupid do you think I’d be?

01:12:38.016 --> 01:12:39.671
Who keeps money in the ceiling?

01:12:39.897 --> 01:12:42.313
Or a ledger of their criminal activities?

01:12:42.906 --> 01:12:45.467
Uses jersey numbers as a combination.

01:12:45.614 --> 01:12:48.630
Although you did figure that out so you’re not entirely dense.

01:12:48.984 --> 01:12:49.849
Why?

01:12:49.931 --> 01:12:52.782
Why? To test your loyalty, Lucas.

01:12:53.571 --> 01:12:54.899
You know what the shame is?

01:12:56.823 --> 01:12:58.753
I would have given you the world, son.

01:13:00.141 --> 01:13:02.297
I would have welcomed you in with open arms.

01:13:03.725 --> 01:13:05.321
But you failed the test.

01:13:05.895 --> 01:13:07.846
And for that, you get nothing.

01:13:08.097 --> 01:13:10.145
For that, you are nothing.

01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:15.685
So it was all a lie?

01:13:16.801 --> 01:13:20.053
The money in the ceiling, the bank account in my name.

01:13:20.129 --> 01:13:21.880
No, the account was real.

01:13:22.115 --> 01:13:25.295
I built that since you were a boy, but that’s gone now, too.

01:13:25.526 --> 01:13:27.226
So’s your heart medication.

01:13:28.931 --> 01:13:31.551
The game’s over, you lose.

01:13:34.353 --> 01:13:35.151
No.

01:13:37.236 --> 01:13:38.337
You’re wrong.

01:13:40.861 --> 01:13:43.441
Because I can finally let you go.

01:13:46.442 --> 01:13:48.944
I mean nothing to you?

01:13:50.696 --> 01:13:52.647
You mean nothing to me.

01:13:52.948 --> 01:13:54.059
I’m out.

01:13:54.874 --> 01:13:56.485
That’s where you’re wrong.

01:13:59.804 --> 01:14:01.366
You’ll never be out.

01:14:02.145 --> 01:14:03.219
Son.

01:14:04.505 --> 01:14:05.759
We’ll see about that.

01:14:27.847 --> 01:14:33.526
Okay, that is the last bag, box or suitcase I shift this summer.

01:14:33.616 --> 01:14:34.835
Your cab’s on the way.

01:14:35.046 --> 01:14:36.848
- I don’t wanna go! 
- I know.

01:14:36.956 --> 01:14:40.104
And I don’t want you to go but life sucks like that.

01:14:40.365 --> 01:14:43.694
But, hey, you are going to be back in no time and then we will be seniors

01:14:43.735 --> 01:14:45.384
and oh what fun we will have then!

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:46.345
Like what?

01:14:46.463 --> 01:14:49.060
Hm, like… kidnapping…

01:14:49.223 --> 01:14:51.706
and… getting married

01:14:51.952 --> 01:14:56.084
and… burning letters from guys before we read them.

01:14:57.191 --> 01:14:59.381
Speaking of, where is our boyfriend?

01:14:59.714 --> 01:15:00.662
I don’t know.

01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:03.441
I guess he’s not even coming to say goodbye to me.

01:15:04.346 --> 01:15:06.743
Suppose it’s a test… for the new me.

01:15:07.783 --> 01:15:09.222
I’m sure he will be here.

01:15:10.386 --> 01:15:12.249
I, on the other hand, will not.

01:15:12.402 --> 01:15:13.159
What!?

01:15:13.303 --> 01:15:17.122
I promised Karen I wouldn’t sleep on TRIC and I’ve gotta return the keys to Deb.

01:15:18.059 --> 01:15:19.047
I’m sorry.

01:15:20.366 --> 01:15:23.011
I’m gonna miss you, Brooke Penelope Davis.

01:15:23.115 --> 01:15:25.801
I’m gonna miss you, Peyton Elizabeth Sawyer.

01:15:30.056 --> 01:15:31.105
Hoes over Bros?

01:15:31.976 --> 01:15:33.460
Buds over Studs.

01:15:39.906 --> 01:15:41.351
I thought you weren’t talking to me.

01:15:41.463 --> 01:15:42.359
I’m not.

01:15:44.055 --> 01:15:45.328
I’m going to High Flyers.

01:15:46.854 --> 01:15:48.253
Nate, that’s great!

01:15:48.867 --> 01:15:52.057
When I get back… all this brother stuff is over.

01:15:53.313 --> 01:15:53.921
What?

01:15:54.003 --> 01:15:56.415
You lied to me, Lucas; about my dad…

01:15:56.931 --> 01:15:58.610
and about going to see Haley.

01:15:59.338 --> 01:16:01.093
I’ve got enough of that in my life.

01:16:01.207 --> 01:16:02.696
Nathan, I was trying to help.

01:16:02.793 --> 01:16:04.492
Yeah, well you can stop that now.

01:16:05.199 --> 01:16:08.651
All I need you to do for me is knock down shots next year, that’s it.

01:16:09.567 --> 01:16:10.889
We’re not brothers.

01:16:12.219 --> 01:16:13.586
We’re not even friends.

01:16:25.336 --> 01:16:26.500
Well…

01:16:28.752 --> 01:16:30.994
I’ll see ya, Brooke. Have a nice summer.

01:16:31.088 --> 01:16:32.583
Oh, thanks, everybody.

01:16:34.446 --> 01:16:35.767
Talking to yourself?

01:16:37.543 --> 01:16:40.748
What, is your… summer job driving a cab?

01:16:43.324 --> 01:16:44.875
I put your stuff in the car.

01:16:46.601 --> 01:16:48.564
So I guess this is goodbye?

01:17:11.116 --> 01:17:13.292
Tell me that was a goodbye kiss.

01:17:14.249 --> 01:17:16.016
I wanna be with you, Brooke.

01:17:18.996 --> 01:17:19.800
What?

01:17:19.912 --> 01:17:21.044
I’m sorry.

01:17:22.427 --> 01:17:23.870
I know we’re friends…

01:17:24.065 --> 01:17:25.569
it’s just how I feel.

01:17:26.673 --> 01:17:29.011
What about Peyton’s stuff?

01:17:29.123 --> 01:17:33.111
I keep that stuff as a reminder of how badly I screwed up things.

01:17:34.633 --> 01:17:35.513
With you.

01:17:36.664 --> 01:17:40.807
To remind myself, if I ever get a second chance…

01:17:41.236 --> 01:17:43.371
I’d never let you go again.

01:17:46.726 --> 01:17:48.343
I don’t know what to say.

01:17:49.163 --> 01:17:50.130
I, um…

01:17:57.006 --> 01:17:58.312
I gotta go.

01:18:00.725 --> 01:18:01.574
Brooke?

01:18:03.299 --> 01:18:05.793
You think… you could ever-

01:18:05.859 --> 01:18:07.037
Lucas…

01:18:09.065 --> 01:18:10.135
I’m sorry.

01:18:12.562 --> 01:18:15.516
I… I gotta go.

01:18:22.842 --> 01:18:23.805
Bye.

01:18:28.612 --> 01:18:30.262
Have a nice summer, Brooke.

01:19:33.201 --> 01:19:34.281
Jake...

01:19:44.271 --> 01:19:45.581
I know it’s late. I-

01:19:45.653 --> 01:19:47.907
You’re right… it is late.

01:19:48.019 --> 01:19:51.101
As a matter of fact, it’s half past the crazy bitch so leave me alone!

01:19:51.178 --> 01:19:53.292
Peyton, I can explain.

01:19:53.379 --> 01:19:55.925
Explain what!? That you’re a stalker…

01:19:56.006 --> 01:19:58.689
or that you’re insane and you’ve been sending me creepy e-mails?!

01:19:58.767 --> 01:19:59.969
I didn’t send you anything.

01:20:00.054 --> 01:20:04.281
Yeah, right. I called your supposed magazine; they’ve never even heard of you.

01:20:06.415 --> 01:20:08.330
My name is Elizabeth.

01:20:09.287 --> 01:20:11.873
Great, so even your name is a lie.

01:20:12.298 --> 01:20:15.898
Like your middle name: Elizabeth.

01:20:17.131 --> 01:20:19.094
It’s where you got your middle name.

01:20:22.687 --> 01:20:23.856
Who are you?

01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:26.553
I’m your mother.

01:21:54.684 --> 01:21:56.608
Oh, Nathan, I was hoping that was you.

01:21:56.773 --> 01:21:58.457
I’ve been here, alone, all night!

01:21:59.185 --> 01:22:00.910
I had… something to do.

01:22:01.806 --> 01:22:02.857
Oh, honey.

01:22:05.252 --> 01:22:10.266
I know this is hard for you but, I promise you, we’ll be free soon.

01:22:10.909 --> 01:22:12.092
I know we will.

01:22:16.065 --> 01:22:17.616
Do you need help with anything?

01:22:17.714 --> 01:22:20.643
No, I just… I have one more bag in the car.

01:22:22.455 --> 01:22:23.300
Okay.

01:22:40.442 --> 01:22:41.349
Hi.

01:23:08.438 --> 01:23:10.344
Looks like it’s just you and me this summer.

01:23:23.549 --> 01:23:25.621
Tennessee Williams once wrote:

01:23:26.748 --> 01:23:28.960
‘We all live in a house of fire.

01:23:29.825 --> 01:23:33.219
No fire department to call. No way out.

01:23:33.900 --> 01:23:36.404
Just the upstairs window to look out of-

01:23:38.073 --> 01:23:40.435
while the fire burns the house down…

01:23:41.607 --> 01:23:44.868
with us trapped, locked in it.’
