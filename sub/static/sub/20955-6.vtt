00:01.569 --> 00:04.372
MAN: Previously on
Queen of the South...

00:04.405 --> 00:06.140
(speaking Spanish)

00:06.174 --> 00:08.142
And just because your father
and I are separated

00:08.176 --> 00:09.710
doesn't mean we can't have
a relationship.

00:09.743 --> 00:11.645
I don't want anything to do
with that world.

00:11.679 --> 00:14.048
You do need a new supplier,
and I can connect you with one.

00:14.082 --> 00:16.317
El Santo.
You need to go to Bolivia.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.886
GEORGE: You and your people
got 72 hours,

00:18.919 --> 00:21.155
or me and my boats
are Cambodia bound.

00:21.189 --> 00:22.390
(indistinct shouting)

00:22.423 --> 00:25.059
WOMAN: (speaking Spanish)

00:25.093 --> 00:26.660
We got 100 grand.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.096
Take it,
you never see us again.

00:28.129 --> 00:29.430
If we don't make this deal
with El Santo,

00:29.463 --> 00:30.598
Guero's going to die.

00:30.631 --> 00:31.599
I'll make an appointment.

00:31.632 --> 00:33.101
It's El Santo's bible.

00:33.134 --> 00:34.602
Yeah, he's not just
a drug dealer.

00:34.635 --> 00:37.105
He runs some sort
of whacked-out cult.

00:37.138 --> 00:39.006
(men shouting)

00:39.039 --> 00:40.608
Give me El Santo.

MAN: (shouting in Spanish)

04:45.386 --> 04:52.393

05:00.200 --> 05:02.970
-Where are we going?
-There's a truck outside!

05:03.003 --> 05:04.772
I saw it! It's the other way!

05:04.805 --> 05:06.173
GUERO: No, no,
it's blocked that way!

05:06.206 --> 05:09.610
(dramatic music)

05:09.643 --> 05:11.311
Go right! They brought us in
through there.

PEDRO: Whoa.
-Damn, girl.

06:16.544 --> 06:18.011
Olivia, we shouldn't.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.414
This shit is like
3,000 a bottle.

06:20.448 --> 06:21.849
What you think, Bela?

06:21.882 --> 06:23.183

OLIVIA: Are we worth it?

06:23.216 --> 06:24.952
(woman laughing,
speaking Spanish)

06:24.985 --> 06:26.620
You said your dad wasn't home.

06:26.654 --> 06:28.121
He isn't.

06:28.155 --> 06:30.123
Then who's in his bedroom, hmm?

06:30.157 --> 06:31.559
Devious maids?

Your dad's just being stupid.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.118
You shouldn't have to see
shit like that.

07:31.151 --> 07:32.285
I'm sorry.

07:34.522 --> 07:36.857
I don't want to be here
right now.

07:36.890 --> 07:39.159
Where do you want to go?

07:40.360 --> 07:41.762
Dallas.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.931
Okay.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.599
-Pedrito?
PEDRO: Eh?

07:45.633 --> 07:48.168

08:06.654 --> 08:08.689
TERESA: What is this place?

08:08.722 --> 08:09.990
Who are these people?

08:12.192 --> 08:15.829
They are the believers.

08:18.331 --> 08:19.633
El Santo?

08:19.667 --> 08:22.469
Yeah.
Some people call me that.

08:22.502 --> 08:25.138
But it is a name

08:25.172 --> 08:27.207
that can never be taken.

08:27.240 --> 08:31.511
EL SANTO: It must always,
always be given.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.514
(sighs)

08:36.249 --> 08:38.385
Why are you here, Teresa?

08:39.853 --> 08:43.323
My soldiers had to pull you

08:43.356 --> 08:45.893
from the jaws of my enemy.

08:45.926 --> 08:48.328
La Capitána.

08:48.361 --> 08:51.531
She would have had
her fill of you.

08:51.565 --> 08:53.767
We represent Camila Vargas.

08:53.801 --> 08:55.402
Why are we being held
as prisoners?

08:55.435 --> 08:57.938
I was not addressing you,

08:57.971 --> 08:58.972
James.

09:00.473 --> 09:01.609
Go on.

09:05.078 --> 09:08.048
We were hoping to start
a relationship with you.

09:08.081 --> 09:10.450
The quality of your product
is known everywhere.

09:10.483 --> 09:14.622
Well, I doubt that those
that you have encountered

09:14.655 --> 09:17.124
have any concept

09:17.157 --> 09:19.259
of the true nature

09:19.292 --> 09:20.560
of quality.

09:22.229 --> 09:23.897
So...

09:23.931 --> 09:24.932
what?

09:27.234 --> 09:29.937
You're washing your product
with ether.

09:29.970 --> 09:32.906
It's an old technique
and a dangerous one.

09:35.008 --> 09:37.978
I know something
more dangerous.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.913
Mediocrity.

09:39.947 --> 09:44.217
Where is the evil in the process
of cocaine, Guero Dávila?

09:44.251 --> 09:45.786
Hmm?

09:45.819 --> 09:47.554
You have traveled
all over the world,

09:47.587 --> 09:51.558
you have sold
to carpenters and kings.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.460
Where does the serpent

09:53.493 --> 09:56.596
slip its fangs
with the venom?

09:56.630 --> 09:57.665
(soft hiss)

10:00.801 --> 10:02.335
Where grown men
sell to children.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.105
Oh, no.

10:05.138 --> 10:08.275
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

10:08.308 --> 10:10.077
When cocaine is treated

10:10.110 --> 10:12.379
with the reverence
it deserves...

10:14.047 --> 10:16.116
It can make
even children smile.

10:16.149 --> 10:18.251
The evil's in the wash.

10:18.285 --> 10:23.957
*

10:23.991 --> 10:25.125
Why?

10:25.158 --> 10:27.494
Most leave cocaine impure

10:27.527 --> 10:29.663
because impurities
makes it heavier,

10:29.697 --> 10:30.964
which means more profit.

10:30.998 --> 10:33.000
And washing in ether

10:33.033 --> 10:34.968
makes it truly pure.

10:35.002 --> 10:36.704
And where did you learn this?

10:36.737 --> 10:39.039
In the streets of Culiacán.

10:39.072 --> 10:40.073
Mmm.

10:42.509 --> 10:44.644
How much do you seek?

10:46.146 --> 10:47.480
100 kilos to start.

10:47.514 --> 10:49.516
No.

10:49.549 --> 10:51.852
I deal in nothing less
than metric tons.

10:53.086 --> 10:55.122
It's just too much.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.990
There must be another
deal we can make.

11:00.894 --> 11:04.965
Do you know why I do not
sell to the Americas?

11:04.998 --> 11:07.134
Because of deals!

11:07.167 --> 11:10.303
Silver passing
from mouth to mouth!

11:10.337 --> 11:11.739
Like a parasite!

11:13.040 --> 11:14.041
Well, I...

11:16.209 --> 11:18.145
...Will not be infested

11:18.178 --> 11:21.381
by your faithless deals.

11:22.582 --> 11:25.252
And yet here we are.

11:25.285 --> 11:26.519
(soft dramatic music)

11:26.553 --> 11:28.421
We passed all your tests,

11:28.455 --> 11:30.123
or we wouldn't
be standing here.

11:31.124 --> 11:32.726
Right?

11:32.760 --> 11:34.795
You know the soldiers
took our money.

11:35.963 --> 11:38.265
Are you just curious?

11:38.298 --> 11:40.067
*

11:40.100 --> 11:41.468
Perhaps.

11:43.871 --> 11:45.105
We'll take the ton.

11:45.138 --> 11:46.239
GUERO: Teresa.

11:46.273 --> 11:49.576
(tense electronic music)

11:49.609 --> 11:51.779
With great respect,

11:51.812 --> 11:53.246
we'll take the ton.

11:53.280 --> 11:58.618
*

11:58.651 --> 12:01.588
(softly)
You have a Judas among you.

12:03.223 --> 12:07.194
Okay, I will consider
your request.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.863
But first,

12:09.897 --> 12:12.132
atonement is required.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.269
See, you have spilled
the blood of my people

12:16.303 --> 12:18.605
when you were trying
to escape.

12:18.638 --> 12:22.142
So a blood sacrifice
is demanded.

12:23.476 --> 12:26.113
So I'm going to give you
a choice, Teresa.

12:26.146 --> 12:29.149
One of them must be
given up to the knife.

12:29.182 --> 12:32.085
You decide,
and decide quickly.

12:32.119 --> 12:34.754
One dies or all of you die.

12:34.788 --> 12:37.791
*

12:37.825 --> 12:38.892
EL SANTO: Decide.

12:38.926 --> 12:41.929
(footsteps fade)

12:43.831 --> 12:45.132
(metal door clanks shut)

12:45.165 --> 12:48.601
(hip-hop music playing)

12:48.635 --> 12:51.504
(laughter and chatter)

12:51.538 --> 12:55.142
*

12:55.175 --> 12:58.045
(sniffs) Ah.
(speaks Spanish)

13:00.047 --> 13:01.614
(sniffs)

13:01.648 --> 13:03.951
(laughs) Join us
at the top, principessa.

13:03.984 --> 13:05.485
KIQUE: (coughs)
-I'm good. Thank you, though.

13:05.518 --> 13:06.954
It don't hurt, Bela.

13:06.987 --> 13:08.621
It's just like
when we used to play

13:08.655 --> 13:10.757
tea party at the bottom
of the pool, only sexier.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.126
Like you're a shark
and everyone else is just legs.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.494
PEDRO: Come on, guapa.

13:14.527 --> 13:15.795
Let's dance.

13:15.829 --> 13:17.430
Ah, Jesus.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.332
She wasn't always like that.

13:19.366 --> 13:21.134
(sighs)

13:21.168 --> 13:24.437
She changed a lot
after her mom died.

13:24.471 --> 13:25.973
Yeah, same with Pedro.

13:27.074 --> 13:30.643
After Manuel was killed,
he's just different, you know?

13:30.677 --> 13:32.679
Do you think
we'll end up like that?

13:32.712 --> 13:34.047
We don't have to be like them.

13:34.081 --> 13:35.983
That's what I like about you.

13:36.016 --> 13:37.951
You manage to see through

13:37.985 --> 13:40.020
all this.

13:40.053 --> 13:41.288
(plane rumbles)

13:41.321 --> 13:44.057
(laughter)

13:45.325 --> 13:47.460
When we land,

13:47.494 --> 13:49.129
Isabela, do you know
where you're going?

13:49.162 --> 13:50.864
Somewhere safe.

13:50.898 --> 13:52.866
Do you want me to come with you?

13:52.900 --> 13:54.467
No.
Thank you.

13:54.501 --> 13:57.070
Like you said,
I gotta do this by myself.

13:59.572 --> 14:00.673
Awesome.

14:02.209 --> 14:04.311
(speaking Spanish)

14:04.344 --> 14:05.913
(laughter and chatter)

14:10.683 --> 14:13.086
He wants one of us to die
to get his drugs.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.988
(scoffs)
He's insane.

14:15.022 --> 14:17.057
Maybe he's just trying
to turn us against each other.

14:18.225 --> 14:19.392
We need a weapon.

14:19.426 --> 14:20.760
If you attack these people,

14:20.793 --> 14:22.429
they will slaughter us.

14:22.462 --> 14:23.931
Oh, yeah?

14:23.964 --> 14:25.265
Then what the hell
is your plan?

14:27.634 --> 14:29.169
We're in this prison
because of you.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.437
Don't you forget that.

14:30.470 --> 14:31.939
No, no, no...

14:31.972 --> 14:33.840
We're here 'cause
Epifanio outsmarted you,

14:33.873 --> 14:35.742
and now you're desperate.

14:35.775 --> 14:37.244
Desperate enough
to give you to El Santo.

14:37.277 --> 14:38.946
Hey, I will gladly
trade my life for hers.

14:38.979 --> 14:41.181
-How about you?
-You're an idiot.

14:41.214 --> 14:42.682
JAMES: He's not gonna let
any of us live.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.284
-Stop it.
-Yeah, how do you know that?

14:44.317 --> 14:46.853
-He's toying with us.
-You're a coward.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.121
-I'm a coward?
-Yeah.

14:48.155 --> 14:50.723
(speaking Spanish)

14:50.757 --> 14:52.392
-You're a rat.
-(scoffs)

14:52.425 --> 14:54.294
Trading other people's
lives for your own.

14:54.327 --> 14:56.296
You're the Judas.

14:56.329 --> 14:58.365
Yeah, who's the one trying
to steal another man's woman?

14:58.398 --> 15:00.433
(scoffs)

15:00.467 --> 15:02.102
You fucking child.

15:02.135 --> 15:04.237
This is business.

15:04.271 --> 15:06.539
But I guess
if you were a real man,

15:06.573 --> 15:08.141
she wouldn't have to beg
to keep you alive.

15:08.175 --> 15:09.376
(blow lands)

15:09.409 --> 15:11.078
(both grunting)

15:11.111 --> 15:12.479
TERESA: Stop it.
Stop it.

15:12.512 --> 15:13.480
This is exactly what he wants.
Stop it!

15:13.513 --> 15:14.881
(shouts)

15:14.914 --> 15:17.117
(metal door clanks open)

15:17.150 --> 15:20.120
(suspenseful music)

15:20.153 --> 15:26.093
*

15:32.599 --> 15:33.633
Me.

15:33.666 --> 15:35.335
Hey, Teresa!

15:35.368 --> 15:37.004
GUERO: Hey!
Hey, take me.

15:37.037 --> 15:39.239
Hey! Take me!

15:39.272 --> 15:40.773
Hey! Teresa!

15:46.379 --> 15:49.349

16:07.334 --> 16:09.002
(doorbell chimes)

16:24.484 --> 16:25.485
Isabela.

16:26.919 --> 16:28.188
Is everything all right?

16:28.221 --> 16:29.356
What are you...

16:29.389 --> 16:31.724
I thought maybe we could talk?

16:33.160 --> 16:34.461
Yes.

16:34.494 --> 16:37.464
(dramatic heartfelt music)

16:37.497 --> 16:41.968
*

16:42.001 --> 16:43.470
Come on.

16:43.503 --> 16:50.077
*

16:50.110 --> 16:51.911
(speaks Spanish)

16:51.944 --> 16:52.945
Hmm?

17:03.423 --> 17:05.958
(speaking Spanish)

17:23.710 --> 17:26.713
(breathing heavily)

17:33.486 --> 17:36.623
Your bible says your heart
is a house of sanctuary,

17:36.656 --> 17:37.924
even for your enemies.

17:40.327 --> 17:42.495
So I kneel in your house...

17:44.797 --> 17:46.699
And I claim sanctuary.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.268
SANTO: You...

17:48.301 --> 17:52.605
think you can
come into my chapel

17:52.639 --> 17:56.609
and kneel before my god

17:56.643 --> 17:59.279
and use his words

17:59.312 --> 18:00.747
against me?

18:02.282 --> 18:04.884
Atonement cannot be derailed

18:04.917 --> 18:07.654
like a child's train set.

18:08.488 --> 18:10.990
(speaking Spanish)

18:13.960 --> 18:17.497
(crowd hums deeply)

18:33.280 --> 18:37.016
I've never seen a loving family
crave blood before.

18:37.049 --> 18:38.751
Dear child,

18:38.785 --> 18:42.789
family has always
been about blood.

18:42.822 --> 18:46.459
(brooding ambient music)

18:46.493 --> 18:48.995
(breathing shakily)

18:49.028 --> 18:56.002
*

18:57.870 --> 18:59.339
Oh, mi'ja.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.212
You have already
given your heart.

19:07.347 --> 19:08.348
Haven't you?

19:11.884 --> 19:12.852
Teresa?

19:14.254 --> 19:15.322
Teresa?

19:16.723 --> 19:20.260
Are you aware of the word
"Moyocoyotzin"?

19:22.395 --> 19:26.065
It means
"she who creates herself."

19:26.833 --> 19:28.167
I suspect that...

19:30.503 --> 19:33.406
You might just be
pure of heart.

19:39.212 --> 19:40.179
(speaks Spanish)

19:41.348 --> 19:43.516
(suspenseful ambient music)

19:46.753 --> 19:49.055

(suspenseful music)

20:16.249 --> 20:23.155
*

20:31.230 --> 20:35.101
And when he had given thanks,

20:35.134 --> 20:36.303
he broke it...

20:39.972 --> 20:40.940
(beetles skittering)

20:40.973 --> 20:43.543
And he said,

20:43.576 --> 20:45.478
"Take this.

20:45.512 --> 20:47.280
"Eat it.

20:47.314 --> 20:48.948
It is my body."

20:48.981 --> 20:53.219
And he quoth,
"Of now done darkness,

20:53.252 --> 20:57.757
"I, wretch,

20:57.790 --> 21:00.460
lay wrestling with my god."

21:01.828 --> 21:04.964
Will you wrestle
with your god, Teresa?

21:10.837 --> 21:12.004
(speaks Spanish)

21:13.940 --> 21:15.608
GIRL: Despiértate, Teresa.

21:15.642 --> 21:17.577

GUERO: We gotta let Camila know
we got the product

21:37.029 --> 21:38.831
from El Santo--
a metric ton.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.801
There's still no signal.

21:42.735 --> 21:44.036
We need to get ahold
of King George.

21:44.070 --> 21:45.405
He could have
already gone by now.

21:46.873 --> 21:48.341
How long till Chile?

21:50.410 --> 21:53.012
To George's border crossing,
it's about...

21:53.045 --> 21:54.914
it's about 4 1/2 hours.

22:08.027 --> 22:09.696
El Camino de la Muerte.

22:10.863 --> 22:12.565
The most dangerous road
in Bolivia.

22:14.567 --> 22:15.835
Shit.

22:17.036 --> 22:18.971
We gotta turn this thing around.
Right now.

22:19.005 --> 22:20.339
No.
They've already seen us.

22:20.373 --> 22:21.808
We need to take
their soldiers out.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.342
TERESA: Pull up
to the roadblock.

22:24.777 --> 22:26.245
Pull up, I mean it.

22:26.278 --> 22:29.982

Sí.

CAPITANA (over radio):
Bring the Mexicana

23:18.498 --> 23:20.900

Go! It's La Capitána!

Go, Guero, go!

We'll take him back with us.

He said, "Turn around."

24:06.479 --> 24:07.647
Why didn't I let him?

24:09.816 --> 24:13.620
When I was in Afghanistan,
some of the guys used to say

24:13.653 --> 24:15.788
there's a different god
for soldiers,

24:15.822 --> 24:18.357
one that judges hearts
instead of deeds.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.161
He loved you.

24:24.063 --> 24:26.232
There's still a couple of hours
before we get there.

24:27.700 --> 24:30.202
You should try
and get some sleep.

24:35.007 --> 24:39.211

Levántate.

29:50.990 --> 29:52.992
-(soft laugh)
-I love your chilaquiles.

29:53.025 --> 29:54.493
They could use more salt.

29:57.029 --> 29:59.098
I think the last time
you made them,

29:59.131 --> 30:00.032
I was ten.

30:01.133 --> 30:02.034
Yeah.

30:03.502 --> 30:04.971
Was the night Nana died.

30:05.004 --> 30:06.505
You were sleeping.

30:06.538 --> 30:08.174
(soft music)

30:08.207 --> 30:10.176
And, you know,
the funny thing is,

30:10.209 --> 30:11.810
all I could think of

30:11.844 --> 30:14.046
was that I wanted
to cook her chilaquiles.

30:14.080 --> 30:15.381
You woke me up,

30:15.414 --> 30:16.849
and we pigged out.

30:18.184 --> 30:20.152
Life is weird.
(sighs)

30:20.186 --> 30:22.454
A bad thing happened, but...

30:22.488 --> 30:24.690
we have a cool memory.

30:24.723 --> 30:26.492
Your hair is so long.

30:27.826 --> 30:29.695
You know, when I was your age,

30:29.728 --> 30:32.031
I used to braid it
in a trenza.

30:32.064 --> 30:39.071
*

30:40.506 --> 30:42.074
I'm so glad you're here.

30:44.576 --> 30:46.678
I miss you so much, you know?

30:47.679 --> 30:51.150
(cries)
Mommy, please come home.

30:51.183 --> 30:52.351
(cries)

30:54.520 --> 30:56.155
I can't, Isabela.

30:56.188 --> 30:58.657
-Papi is cheating on you.
-(soft laugh)

30:58.690 --> 31:00.092
No, he's not.

31:00.126 --> 31:01.227
What?

31:04.030 --> 31:05.397
He didn't speak to you?

31:05.431 --> 31:08.100
I thought that's why
you were here.

31:08.134 --> 31:09.635
Your father and I...

31:11.437 --> 31:12.838
We're getting a divorce.

31:12.871 --> 31:15.074
No. No, you--

31:15.107 --> 31:16.508
you can change your mind.

31:16.542 --> 31:17.876
You don't--you don't
have to do that.

31:17.910 --> 31:20.712
I already signed the papers,
Isabela.

31:20.746 --> 31:22.414
(exhales sharply)

31:22.448 --> 31:24.616
Nobody told me.

31:24.650 --> 31:26.618
No one tells me anything.

31:26.652 --> 31:27.987
I'm not a child.

31:29.388 --> 31:31.623
Okay.
(sniffles)

31:31.657 --> 31:33.125
No, Isabela.

31:33.159 --> 31:34.460
Stay.
Stay for the night.

31:34.493 --> 31:36.128
I can't stay here.

31:36.162 --> 31:39.765
*

31:39.798 --> 31:41.934
(door clicks and closes)

31:41.968 --> 31:43.369
Yeah.

31:43.402 --> 31:45.637
We'll be at the border
in a few hours.

31:45.671 --> 31:48.941
Sorry, Giant Peach.
That ship has sailed.

31:48.975 --> 31:50.476
GEORGE: Have to catch you
on the next one.

31:50.509 --> 31:52.144
Look, we got held up.

31:52.178 --> 31:54.280
We're on our way
to your cross point now.

31:54.313 --> 31:56.448
GEORGE: See, that ain't
my problem, kemosabe.

31:56.482 --> 31:59.251
I gave you a deadline.
You shat the bed.

31:59.285 --> 32:00.886
No, you need to wait for us.

32:00.919 --> 32:03.289
Give it to me.
George?

32:03.322 --> 32:05.291
It's Teresa.

32:05.324 --> 32:07.093
Now, don't you try and
sweet-talk me, baby girl.

32:07.126 --> 32:08.394
Ain't nothing to discuss.

32:08.427 --> 32:10.396
You don't know what we've got.

32:10.429 --> 32:12.231
GEORGE: Darlin', I've been
around the world twice and back.

32:12.264 --> 32:14.233
Ain't nothing you can buy
for a million bucks

32:14.266 --> 32:15.901
gonna shake my cherry tree.

32:15.934 --> 32:17.936
We've got a metric ton
of Bolivian flake.

32:17.970 --> 32:19.271
And that's just the start.

32:19.972 --> 32:21.907
Christ, girl.

32:21.940 --> 32:24.343
You got a ton of blow
off ol' creepy crawler himself?

32:24.376 --> 32:25.811
He got you on the clock?

32:25.844 --> 32:26.845
A week.

32:26.878 --> 32:28.180
A week?

32:28.214 --> 32:30.116
Every time I turn my back,

32:30.149 --> 32:31.950
you're dowsed in gasoline
and juggling fire!

32:31.984 --> 32:33.585
You know that shit's
a death sentence

32:33.619 --> 32:35.521
you don't get back
to Dallas, tout suite.

32:35.554 --> 32:37.156
TERESA: Please,

32:37.189 --> 32:39.291
you're the only one
who can help me.

32:39.325 --> 32:40.859
God damn it!

32:42.228 --> 32:44.696
Look, you tell Giant Peach,

32:44.730 --> 32:47.199
you ain't at the border
by sundown,

32:47.233 --> 32:48.767
I'll leave y'all to rot
down there,

32:48.800 --> 32:50.336
and no amount
of pretty-faced guilt

32:50.369 --> 32:52.204
is gonna save your ass,
you hear me?

32:52.238 --> 32:54.006
Okay.

32:54.040 --> 32:55.707
George,

32:55.741 --> 32:57.209
thank you.

32:58.977 --> 33:01.213
Turn around.

33:01.247 --> 33:02.648
Don't give me that look.

33:02.681 --> 33:05.017
You ain't never seen
a hero before?

33:05.051 --> 33:06.785
(chuckles)

33:06.818 --> 33:09.788
(tense electronic music)

33:09.821 --> 33:16.828
*

33:22.334 --> 33:25.637
(music builds gradually)

33:25.671 --> 33:32.178
*

33:40.752 --> 33:43.255
El Camino de la Muerte.

33:43.289 --> 33:45.157
The most dangerous road
in Bolivia.

33:45.191 --> 33:47.759
(suspenseful music)

33:47.793 --> 33:49.761
TERESA:
Careful around this bend.

33:49.795 --> 33:50.796
Why?

33:52.764 --> 33:55.434
TERESA: Nothing.
Never mind.

34:02.074 --> 34:04.410
(speaking Spanish)

34:07.946 --> 34:08.914
(horn honks)

34:11.983 --> 34:13.085
(thunder rumbles)

34:13.119 --> 34:14.553
Andale, cabrónes.

34:14.586 --> 34:15.587
MAN: (mumbles in Spanish)

34:18.324 --> 34:19.358
TERESA: Where are you going?

34:19.391 --> 34:20.726
I gotta take a leak.

34:31.637 --> 34:34.440
(thunder rumbles)

34:34.473 --> 34:36.442
We'll find a way
to make the shipment work.

34:36.475 --> 34:38.444
This isn't a one-off.

34:38.477 --> 34:40.779
El Santo expects
weekly payments.

34:40.812 --> 34:42.114
And to make those payments,
we're gonna have to

34:42.148 --> 34:43.749
move three times
what we have been.

34:43.782 --> 34:45.284
Your boyfriend screwed us
by coming down here.

34:45.317 --> 34:46.785
We didn't have a choice.

34:46.818 --> 34:47.953
We could have thought
of something else

34:47.986 --> 34:49.388
in those three days.

34:49.421 --> 34:50.956
One that doesn't end up
with us dead.

34:50.989 --> 34:52.158
GUERO: Wouldn't have
made a difference.

34:52.191 --> 34:53.759
You had to make a big move.

34:53.792 --> 34:55.227
All your suppliers
were burned.

34:55.261 --> 34:56.628
All right, somebody
would have tried

34:56.662 --> 34:58.264
to move in on your territory.

34:58.297 --> 35:00.366
None of that has anything
to do with you.

35:02.468 --> 35:03.602
GUERO: You put her
in the middle of this.

35:03.635 --> 35:05.404
Stop it.

35:05.437 --> 35:07.105
Camila's backed into a corner.
She's paranoid.

35:07.139 --> 35:09.074
She's out there
just swinging in the dark.

35:09.107 --> 35:10.909
I mean, how long you think
it's gonna be till it's

35:10.942 --> 35:13.779
Teresa who's not supposed
to come back from a mission?

35:13.812 --> 35:16.782
Huh? You gonna take her out
if Camila tells you to, James?

35:16.815 --> 35:18.584
-Stop it.
-No, no, no, hold up, babe.

35:18.617 --> 35:20.452
I want to hear
what his answer is.

35:20.486 --> 35:22.654
You have no idea
what loyalty is.

35:24.456 --> 35:25.457
Sounds like a yes to me.

35:25.491 --> 35:27.459
This is ridiculous.

35:27.493 --> 35:29.795
We're still alive after
all that happened to us, okay?

35:29.828 --> 35:32.431
We have the product.
We have the transpo.

35:32.464 --> 35:34.866
I'm tired of your bullshit.

35:37.669 --> 35:40.005
(thunder rumbles)

(tense music)

35:59.258 --> 36:01.493
That guy has a radio.

36:01.527 --> 36:03.829
Looks like you led us
into another ambush.

36:06.565 --> 36:09.067
Shit, he's a lookout.
Where's Teresa?

36:12.204 --> 36:15.173

36:57.649 --> 36:59.285
You're gonna get her killed.

36:59.318 --> 37:02.554
She doesn't know who
you really are, but I do.

37:02.588 --> 37:05.023
You don't deserve her.

37:05.056 --> 37:06.625
Do you?

37:08.794 --> 37:10.862
I've been around people
like you my whole life.

37:10.896 --> 37:13.332
Selfish. No loyalty.

37:32.451 --> 37:34.286
You saved me.

37:34.320 --> 37:37.756
Why?
(soft groan)

37:37.789 --> 37:40.125
You kept her alive
when I couldn't.

37:41.293 --> 37:43.161
She kept herself alive.

37:43.194 --> 37:44.596
Hey, I'm not saying
I'm not gonna kill you.

37:44.630 --> 37:46.432
I just--

37:46.465 --> 37:48.800
I ain't gonna
kill you right now.

But if I'm going to die,

38:05.183 --> 38:07.753
I'm going to pull you out
by the root

38:07.786 --> 38:11.657

into hell with me.

I need you to do

Of course, anything.
