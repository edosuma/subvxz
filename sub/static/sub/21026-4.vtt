When you're airplane trapping,

Alaska Range,

Morgan Beasley
is heading home fully loaded.

01:28.226 --> 01:30.469
He spent his last dollars
on critical supplies

he'll need to survive
the coming winter

01:32.713 --> 01:34.991

05:24.082 --> 05:26.429
Tom: The Kootenai River
is 40 degrees,

so even when it's severely cold,
it doesn't freeze.

05:29.950 --> 05:33.022
But I've never trapped
the Kootenai at all

Marty: I've been grounded for
quite a while, almost a week.

07:23.857 --> 07:28.413
A big cold snap came in,
and once it hits 40, 45 below,

07:28.448 --> 07:30.070
it's dangerous to do anything,

07:30.104 --> 07:31.796

flying an airplane.

but this is the first time
in six days it's safe to fly.

07:44.947 --> 07:47.328
Marty: Plane trapping sometimes
can be aggravating

07:47.363 --> 07:50.297
because the weather dictates
when you can check them.

07:50.331 --> 07:53.507
When you're stuck and you
can't check your traps,

07:53.542 --> 07:55.785
what I worry about is
other animals coming along

07:55.820 --> 07:57.822
and eating the animals
I've already caught.

07:57.856 --> 07:59.513

07:59.548 --> 08:02.447

08:28.231 --> 08:30.786
It sounds easy because you fly
around in an airplane,

but the actuality is,

08:32.132 --> 08:34.514
that it's more work
than snow-machine trapping

08:34.548 --> 08:36.343
because you're always
pushing daylight

08:36.377 --> 08:38.932

08:38.966 --> 08:41.831
Aircraft fuel out here,
it's a precious commodity.

08:44.454 --> 08:47.699
Plane burns about
8 gallons an hour,

08:47.734 --> 08:49.563

cost of extra fuel.

13:04.680 --> 13:07.717
from a devastating blow.

13:07.752 --> 13:10.065
Eustace:
That big tornado set me back.

13:10.099 --> 13:12.136
I'm just really behind.

13:12.170 --> 13:14.828
About everything needs
a little attention,

13:14.863 --> 13:17.106
and all my time
has been spent fixing up

13:17.141 --> 13:20.869
from the direct hit
of the storm.

13:20.903 --> 13:23.733
Whee.

13:23.768 --> 13:25.701
Narrator: Among the damage
on Turtle Island

13:25.735 --> 13:28.255
is 12 acres of prime timber
that Eustace

13:28.290 --> 13:30.430
intended to fuel his
growing lumber business

13:30.464 --> 13:32.018
for years to come.

13:32.052 --> 13:35.297
Eustace: That tornado just
really tore up about 30 years

13:35.331 --> 13:36.919
of my timber operation.

13:36.954 --> 13:40.612
That was tens of thousands
of dollars worth of lumber.

13:42.304 --> 13:44.064
Narrator: Now that most of
the infrastructure repairs

13:44.099 --> 13:45.514
are finally complete,

13:45.548 --> 13:48.620
they're prepared to start
salvaging their doomed profits,

13:48.655 --> 13:52.210
and they need to move fast.

13:52.245 --> 13:54.316
Eustace:
What happens if a tree is down,

13:54.350 --> 13:56.007
doesn't have life
moving through it,

13:56.042 --> 13:59.252
then the insects start
getting in it and decay, rot.

13:59.286 --> 14:01.564
It just starts decomposing.

14:01.599 --> 14:03.670
Nobody wants a rotten board.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.710
Man, that's a lot of down
timber here, Preston.

14:09.745 --> 14:11.471
Boy,
you got that right.

14:11.505 --> 14:14.577
Maybe we won't
waste it all.

14:14.612 --> 14:16.441
We'll just pull in here.

14:16.476 --> 14:17.718
Come up, girl.

14:17.753 --> 14:19.203
I know the worms are going
to eat them sometime.

14:19.237 --> 14:21.274
I don't know if they've started
eaten on them yet or not,

14:21.308 --> 14:22.482
but they're gonna
get them.

14:22.516 --> 14:23.966
That's for sure.

14:24.001 --> 14:26.555
If we show up with a truck-load
of lumber to sell to somebody

14:26.589 --> 14:28.005
that's got worm holes
all through it,

14:28.039 --> 14:29.627
they'll just say,
"Goodbye."

14:29.661 --> 14:31.560
Yeah, "No, thank you."

14:31.594 --> 14:33.700
Narrator: They're combing the
wreckage for the most solid

14:33.734 --> 14:36.082
of the downed trees
with fewer cracks

14:36.116 --> 14:39.188
that worms can tunnel
through to the heartwood.

14:39.223 --> 14:42.122
We want good integrity
without having been cracked

14:42.157 --> 14:44.366
or crunched
during that big tornado.

14:44.400 --> 14:48.128
A healthy tree can yield up
to $400 when milled into boards.

14:48.163 --> 14:51.338
But if the wood has been
compromise by worms,

14:51.373 --> 14:53.996
its value plunges
to mere pennies.

14:54.031 --> 14:56.274
Preston: We cut it off at both
ends and limb it up

14:56.309 --> 14:58.276
so the limbs
don't get hung on things.

15:00.727 --> 15:03.385
Then go through and measure
those logs to length,

15:03.419 --> 15:06.906
about 5, 6 feet,
cut them to length.

15:20.989 --> 15:23.439
And then bring a sled in
and load them up.

15:25.476 --> 15:27.719
It's getting heavier
or I'm getting older.

15:27.754 --> 15:29.376
I'm getting older.

15:29.411 --> 15:31.896
Sure hope all these logs
don't turn out wormy.

15:33.656 --> 15:37.074
We really need to get
to the mill and saw one open

15:37.108 --> 15:38.730
to see
if they're in there at all.

15:41.526 --> 15:45.116
Go ahead.

15:45.151 --> 15:48.706
Eustace: Well, these trees are
my main cash flow here.

15:48.740 --> 15:52.434
If they're just rotten, if those
worms have been cutting on 'em,

15:52.468 --> 15:53.435
I lose my money.

15:53.469 --> 15:55.161
I lose my trees.

15:55.195 --> 15:57.818
It's gone.

16:07.449 --> 16:11.660
Narrator: In the frozen great
Alaska Range, it's over an hour

16:11.694 --> 16:13.386
since Morgan arrived
by helicopter

16:13.420 --> 16:18.425
at the agreed rendezvous point
12 miles from his homestead.

16:18.460 --> 16:21.981
But Margaret and the pack
of horses are nowhere in sight.

16:24.535 --> 16:26.571
Oh, brr.

16:28.815 --> 16:30.575
Oh, stiff.

16:32.922 --> 16:34.131
Wonder where she is.

16:34.165 --> 16:35.822
I'm getting pretty cold.

16:35.856 --> 16:37.686
I'm just gonna get
a fire going,

16:37.720 --> 16:39.584
and if she's not here
in another hour,

16:39.619 --> 16:42.691
I'll probably take off
walking to see what's up.

16:42.725 --> 16:44.003
I hope everything's all right.

16:44.037 --> 16:46.315
It's a long way to take horses
for one person.

16:46.350 --> 16:47.972
You got to have
your stuff together,

16:48.007 --> 16:50.802
know what you're doing
to get horses over this trail

16:50.837 --> 16:52.873
and make sound judgments

16:52.908 --> 16:55.290
about what's possible
and what's not.

17:02.918 --> 17:04.644
I think I just heard a bell.

17:08.510 --> 17:10.581
[ Bell ringing ]

17:10.615 --> 17:11.789
Yeah, that's the horse bell.

17:11.823 --> 17:13.515
All right.
Here she comes.

17:13.549 --> 17:16.035
Cool. Good, good.

17:20.453 --> 17:21.799
Margaret: Come on.

17:21.833 --> 17:23.766
Morgan: I can't tell you
how relieving it is

17:23.801 --> 17:28.357
to hear her coming
because now I know she's okay.

17:28.392 --> 17:30.601
Hello.
How was it?

17:30.635 --> 17:32.327
-Hey.
-Good to see you.

17:32.361 --> 17:33.811
-You, too.
-Oh.

17:33.845 --> 17:35.088
Glad you're here.

17:35.123 --> 17:37.228
Here, come on.

17:37.263 --> 17:39.610
Morgan: Come on, Fayla.

17:39.644 --> 17:42.406
I'm glad you made it.
I was getting a little worried.

17:42.440 --> 17:46.582
Yeah, took me far longer
than I expected.

17:46.617 --> 17:49.723
The trail was a lot sketchier
than I had anticipated.

17:49.758 --> 17:52.485
There were some creek crossings,
some areas with overflow,

17:52.519 --> 17:55.074
just all sorts of little
hazards along the way.

17:55.108 --> 17:58.767
And wrangling all four horses
at once, got to go slow.

17:58.801 --> 18:01.839
Hey.
Glad you made it safe.

18:01.873 --> 18:04.393
I'm glad you're back.

18:04.428 --> 18:06.015
I got a little something
for you from town.

18:06.050 --> 18:07.189
Oh, nice.

18:07.224 --> 18:09.674
Yeah, it's over here
by the feed.

18:09.709 --> 18:11.366
He couldn't carry
a whole lot,

18:11.400 --> 18:14.196
but it should about top us off
for the winter.

18:14.231 --> 18:16.164
Good.

18:16.198 --> 18:18.856
-[ Gasps ] Ooh!
-Enjoy before it freezes.

18:18.890 --> 18:20.858
-What a treasure.
-Yeah.

18:20.892 --> 18:22.584
Better put it
inside your jacket.

18:22.618 --> 18:24.068
Thank you.
Yeah.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.070
Or eat it now.
-Or eat it now.

18:26.105 --> 18:29.108
Margaret: It's been a long time
since I've had some fresh fruit,

18:29.142 --> 18:30.350
and I love oranges,

18:30.385 --> 18:32.180
and it was a great gift
to receive

18:32.214 --> 18:34.699
and have after that long trip.

18:40.222 --> 18:42.259
Morgan: We're gonna get
the horses loaded up

18:42.293 --> 18:43.846
and get on down the trail,

18:43.881 --> 18:46.055
see if we can make it
home before dark.

18:46.090 --> 18:48.851
Ugh, there we go.

18:50.232 --> 18:52.407
We still have a long ways to go,
and the whole way,

18:52.441 --> 18:53.822
it's gonna be a little iffy.

18:53.856 --> 18:57.136
We're losing daylight
really fast.

18:57.170 --> 18:59.759
Come on, horses.

18:59.793 --> 19:01.588
They've got some
pretty heavy loads.

19:01.623 --> 19:03.832
Come on, big kiddos, let's go.

19:03.866 --> 19:06.283
Hopefully there's no
major obstacles.

19:14.325 --> 19:16.189
Narrator: In Northern Montana,

19:16.224 --> 19:18.018
Tom strikes out
into new territory

19:18.053 --> 19:21.263
50 miles from home.

19:21.298 --> 19:23.783
He's never trapped the remote
Kootenai River before,

19:23.817 --> 19:25.888
but his apprentice,
Sean, is a seasoned hunter

19:25.923 --> 19:28.822
who knows the lay of the land.

19:28.857 --> 19:30.238
Show me the beavers.

19:30.272 --> 19:32.792
I was born and raised right here
in the Yaak River Valley,

19:32.826 --> 19:35.070
so I have a lot of experience
on the Kootenai.

19:37.072 --> 19:38.453
Me bringing something
to the table

19:38.487 --> 19:39.799
makes me feel
a little bit better

19:39.833 --> 19:42.008
because he's teaching me
all these different things

19:42.042 --> 19:44.528
about the trapping trade.

19:48.187 --> 19:51.259
Narrator: The Kootenai carves
a 485-mile path

19:51.293 --> 19:52.915
through the Northern Rockies,

19:52.950 --> 19:55.435
but, for today,
Tom and Sean will focus on

19:55.470 --> 19:56.954
a 7-mile stretch known

19:56.988 --> 20:01.752
for the kind of placid currents
that make good beaver habitat.

20:01.786 --> 20:04.030
Sean: You kind of tell me
where you want to go here.

20:04.064 --> 20:05.307
You're the beaver expert,
so...

20:05.342 --> 20:08.034
Well, we just -- we just got
to go and find the signs.

20:08.068 --> 20:09.898
-Go find some sign, okay.
-It's all...Yep.

20:09.932 --> 20:13.660
Tom: Beaver eat bark, and so,
traveling down the river,

20:13.695 --> 20:17.181
you see any areas where
there's four or five sticks

20:17.216 --> 20:19.666
that have had the bark
all eaten off of them,

20:19.701 --> 20:21.979
that's a beaver's dinner table.

20:22.013 --> 20:23.843
You seeing any of that sign
in there, Tom,

20:23.877 --> 20:25.465
anything
you're looking for?

20:25.500 --> 20:28.606
I don't see anything
right along here.

20:34.888 --> 20:36.959
So I think that's one
of those old lodges there,

20:36.994 --> 20:39.272
Tom, that
I was thinking about.

20:39.307 --> 20:41.136
See,
it's all old sticks,

20:41.170 --> 20:43.966
and it looks like it --
that all collapsed.

20:44.001 --> 20:46.900
-Yep.
-Yeah, this is all pretty old.

20:46.935 --> 20:50.663
Beavers, usually, when they live
in an environment for very long,

20:50.697 --> 20:54.287
they usually eat down
a lot of the food source.

20:54.322 --> 20:56.358
After they do that,
they usually move,

20:56.393 --> 20:59.258
then, to a different spot.

20:59.292 --> 21:02.537
Isn't worth setting in,
I don't think.

21:02.571 --> 21:05.436
We have more than 7 miles
of river to go,

21:05.471 --> 21:07.956
so got to be
some beaver in here.

21:07.990 --> 21:11.235
♪♪

21:23.316 --> 21:25.076
I haven't seen anything.

21:25.111 --> 21:27.872
That's kind of
bewildering me.

21:27.907 --> 21:29.149
You have to go on the sign.

21:29.184 --> 21:31.117
If you see sign,
well, then, set traps.

21:31.151 --> 21:33.706
When you don't see sign,
you don't set traps.

21:33.740 --> 21:35.673
And we haven't found
any sign yet.

21:35.708 --> 21:38.297
So we'll just have
to keep looking for them.

21:47.375 --> 21:48.583
Narrator: In Alaska,

21:48.617 --> 21:51.448
with sunset hanging
over the great Alaska Range

21:51.482 --> 21:53.691
and more than 9 miles to go,

21:53.726 --> 21:57.074
Morgan and Margaret
make the push for home.

21:57.108 --> 21:59.041
Morgan: First part of this
trail's really good,

21:59.076 --> 22:00.353
able to trot a bit.

22:00.388 --> 22:01.665
You know, when they're trotting,

22:01.699 --> 22:03.218
they're doing 5,
7 miles an hour.

22:03.252 --> 22:05.185
Narrator: But the most
treacherous part

22:05.220 --> 22:06.980
of their journey
is still ahead...

22:07.015 --> 22:09.051
How bad were
the creek crossings?

22:09.086 --> 22:10.708
Very slippery.

22:10.743 --> 22:12.089
...a section of terrain

22:12.123 --> 22:14.367
Margaret's already
tackled once today.

22:14.402 --> 22:16.507
Fayla fell down
once on some ice.

22:16.542 --> 22:17.991
A couple places,
I had to get off

22:18.026 --> 22:19.303
and try
and pull them across.

22:19.338 --> 22:20.925
Yeah, we'll make
some time right now

22:20.960 --> 22:22.858
so we don't have to cross
that stuff in the dark.

22:22.893 --> 22:24.239
Yeah.

22:24.273 --> 22:26.759
Good girl.

22:31.557 --> 22:34.145
The first creek's
right up here.

22:34.180 --> 22:37.563
All righty.
We'll check it out.

22:37.597 --> 22:38.667
Morgan: This first creek

22:38.702 --> 22:40.531
had got some pretty good
shelf ice on it.

22:40.566 --> 22:42.809
The horses broke a little bit
on their way in,

22:42.844 --> 22:45.881
so they might be nervous
trying to go back across it

22:45.916 --> 22:48.401
if they had some of
that ice give way.

22:48.436 --> 22:51.300
Narrator: Each horse is packing
an additional 150 pounds

22:51.335 --> 22:53.199
on the return crossing.

22:53.233 --> 22:55.097
The extra weight
makes it more difficult

22:55.132 --> 22:58.031
to keep their footing
in icy conditions.

22:58.066 --> 22:59.585
You can do it, girl.

22:59.619 --> 23:01.207
Come on.
You can do it.

23:01.241 --> 23:03.209
It's all right.
It's all right.

23:03.243 --> 23:05.867
No. No,
she ain't gonna do it.

23:07.696 --> 23:09.146
Why don't you hold her?

23:09.180 --> 23:10.872
And I'll take
those two across.

23:10.906 --> 23:14.289
That way, you only have
to hold one horse

23:14.323 --> 23:16.774
and not two.

23:16.809 --> 23:21.020
Fayla, the main packhorse there,
she's real smart,

23:21.054 --> 23:22.780
and she's a little more game,

23:22.815 --> 23:24.817
a little braver than Frilla.

23:24.851 --> 23:27.613
Once the horses see one
horse cross the creek,

23:27.647 --> 23:29.994
they're usually way
more willing to try it.

23:30.029 --> 23:30.995
Come on, Fayla.

23:31.030 --> 23:32.376
Come on, Nicety.
Watch your foot.

23:32.411 --> 23:33.929
Watch your toes here.

23:33.964 --> 23:36.484
What worries me about this ice
is that they'll start to slip,

23:36.518 --> 23:37.968
and they'll thrash,
and they'll panic,

23:38.002 --> 23:40.557
and they'll jump,
try to get clear of the ice,

23:40.591 --> 23:42.179
and they'll land on
some obstacle

23:42.213 --> 23:45.769
and hurt themselves.

23:45.803 --> 23:47.046
You can come
right through here.

23:47.080 --> 23:48.357
It's okay.

23:48.392 --> 23:50.187
Just go slow.

23:50.221 --> 23:51.671
Go slow, girly.

23:51.706 --> 23:53.397
Good job.

23:53.432 --> 23:55.917
Good job.

23:59.990 --> 24:01.163
Come on, Lucha.

24:03.821 --> 24:06.410
Come on.
Don't jump.

24:13.037 --> 24:14.073
Ha ha!
Good horses!

24:14.107 --> 24:15.661
Good job.

24:15.695 --> 24:17.076
-Thanks.
-See, Frilla?

24:17.110 --> 24:18.974
That wasn't nothing
to be afraid of.

24:21.080 --> 24:22.599
Well, one creek down.

24:22.633 --> 24:25.947
I think we got four
or five more to go.

24:25.981 --> 24:28.190
I just need to make sure
that we're through the worst

24:28.225 --> 24:31.400
of these icy creek
crossings before dark

24:31.435 --> 24:33.402
because I don't want
to mess around

24:33.437 --> 24:35.163
with horses on ice
when it's dark.

24:35.197 --> 24:37.476
That's -- that's
a little too much.

24:45.553 --> 24:49.246
Narrator: In Alaska, Morgan
and Margaret are racing

24:49.280 --> 24:51.835
to make it home
before nightfall.

24:51.869 --> 24:53.181
Morgan:
These horses are working hard.

24:53.215 --> 24:55.632
They're having a long day.

24:55.666 --> 24:57.599
They'll get a good dinner
when they get home.

24:59.946 --> 25:02.777
Narrator: With just two hours
of daylight left

25:02.811 --> 25:05.642
and 4 miles still to go,
they can't slow down.

25:05.676 --> 25:08.783
And the most treacherous terrain
is still to come.

25:11.026 --> 25:13.857
A bunch of overflow
and a beaver swamp up ahead.

25:13.891 --> 25:15.962
I'm gonna go
check it out.

25:23.832 --> 25:27.387
It looks like there's a bunch
of fresh overflow here,

25:27.422 --> 25:31.909
and there's a bunch
of sharp sticks in this stuff,

25:31.944 --> 25:33.842
so I'm worried about
the horses busting through

25:33.877 --> 25:36.120
and cutting their legs.

25:36.155 --> 25:38.364
Narrator: Margaret navigated
the horses through this section

25:38.398 --> 25:39.745
of trail on the way in,

25:39.779 --> 25:43.680
but now they're carrying
300 pounds of extra weight.

25:43.714 --> 25:46.165
This area here makes me
really nervous.

25:46.199 --> 25:47.753
I don't like it at all.

25:47.787 --> 25:49.996
If a horse breaks
through the ice

25:50.031 --> 25:53.034
and there's all these spikes
underneath in the water,

25:53.068 --> 25:56.762
they could get very badly hurt.

25:56.796 --> 25:59.247
I think we'd be a lot safer
to go around

25:59.281 --> 26:01.629
and just go through the brush.

26:03.838 --> 26:05.494
I think
I found a way around.

26:05.529 --> 26:07.048
-Oh, good.
-It's pretty bad.

26:07.082 --> 26:09.671
It must be deeper than
when you came through

26:09.706 --> 26:10.879
because it's all...

26:10.914 --> 26:12.881
There are
no tracks or nothing.

26:12.916 --> 26:15.056
It's like 3 feet deep.

26:15.090 --> 26:16.436
We'll take them
one at a time.

26:16.471 --> 26:17.368
Okay.

26:17.403 --> 26:19.750
So we'll each lead
one animal.

26:19.785 --> 26:21.614
If they're tied together,
they'll just go

26:21.649 --> 26:23.271
different ways around one tree

26:23.305 --> 26:25.584
and get wrapped up
with the trees.

26:25.618 --> 26:26.654
Okay.

26:26.688 --> 26:27.724
I'm gonna
take Nicety off, then.

26:27.758 --> 26:29.311
Back up.

26:29.346 --> 26:31.486
Back up.
Back up, buddy.

26:33.868 --> 26:35.041
All right.

26:35.076 --> 26:37.665
You ready to bust
some brush, Frilla?

26:37.699 --> 26:39.563
Okay.
-Come on, heads up, buddy.

26:39.598 --> 26:40.806
Easy does it.

26:40.840 --> 26:42.014
Just a little brush.

26:42.048 --> 26:43.947
You guys walk through
it all the time.

26:46.743 --> 26:49.159
Good horses.

26:49.193 --> 26:50.367
Brush is really thick.

26:50.401 --> 26:52.645
Can kind of just barely
figure out a tunnel

26:52.680 --> 26:54.785
to lead these horses through.

26:59.687 --> 27:03.622
This is the worst brush right
in here, so watch out.

27:05.037 --> 27:07.039
Come on, Frilla.
You can do it.

27:07.073 --> 27:09.213
-Come on, Nicety.
-Good job, Frilla.

27:09.248 --> 27:11.630
Yeah, nice little jump,
a little hop.

27:11.664 --> 27:15.357
Almost there,
on the homestretch.

27:15.392 --> 27:16.945
Come on, Nicety.

27:16.980 --> 27:19.499
Good boy.

27:19.534 --> 27:20.673
Oh, good job.

27:20.708 --> 27:21.812
Okay, let's lead them
right up here.

27:21.847 --> 27:23.400
We're through it.

27:23.434 --> 27:25.160
Go back
and get the other two.

27:27.887 --> 27:28.854
Come on, Lucha.

27:28.888 --> 27:31.615
Slow and steady,
Miss Fayla.

27:34.445 --> 27:36.068
Morgan:
Good packhorse.

27:36.102 --> 27:37.828
Watch your feet.

27:37.863 --> 27:39.658
Oh!

27:39.692 --> 27:41.452
Hold on.

27:41.487 --> 27:43.765
We okay?

27:43.800 --> 27:47.320
Yep, that's just the
double diamond doing its job.

27:47.355 --> 27:49.806
Good girl, Fayla.

27:49.840 --> 27:53.948
Morgan: Had a few little spills,
but we got them through

27:53.982 --> 27:57.710
and kept on moving
through the timber.

27:57.745 --> 27:58.884
I'm thinking, at this point,

27:58.918 --> 28:01.024
that we're not gonna
make it back before dark.

28:03.854 --> 28:04.959
All right.

28:04.993 --> 28:06.719
Back together again.

28:06.754 --> 28:07.962
Margaret: Made it.

28:07.996 --> 28:09.204
Look out, Frilla.

28:09.239 --> 28:11.034
Come on, Lucha.
Step up.

28:11.068 --> 28:12.725
Packs look good.

28:12.760 --> 28:13.899
Are we gonna
saddle back up?

28:13.933 --> 28:16.246
I might -- I'm gonna walk
for a little while.

28:16.280 --> 28:18.075
-Warm your feet up?
-Yeah, I'm cold.

28:18.110 --> 28:19.525
Gonna keep on trucking.

28:19.559 --> 28:22.908
Hopefully we can make it through
the worst of this before dark.

28:22.942 --> 28:24.737
All right.
-Okay.

28:24.772 --> 28:27.464
-You all good?
-Yep.

28:27.498 --> 28:29.569
Heads up.
Let's go, big kiddos.

28:29.604 --> 28:31.123
Come on.

28:31.157 --> 28:33.677
Heads up.

28:43.687 --> 28:47.760
Narrator: 150 feet
above Alaska's Hard Luck Creek,

28:47.795 --> 28:51.281
Marty zeroes in
on his last lynx trap.

28:51.315 --> 28:55.388
He's come up empty on the four
other traps he's checked today.

29:22.139 --> 29:23.934
I got a cubby back here.

29:26.592 --> 29:29.595
I don't see any fresh tracks
for this fresh snow.

29:37.465 --> 29:39.087
Damn it!

29:39.122 --> 29:41.814
Narrator: Marty's line has been
soaking for a full week,

29:41.849 --> 29:44.852
making the shutout more
than just bad luck.

29:44.886 --> 29:48.096
It's a fatal blow
to Marty's plans.

29:48.131 --> 29:50.719
Marty:
One thing about trapping is,

29:50.754 --> 29:52.376
you can't catch
what isn't there.

29:52.411 --> 29:55.069
I haven't caught any cats
because there's almost no cats.

29:55.103 --> 29:58.244
They're not around here anymore.

29:58.279 --> 30:00.799
Gonna call it a day.

30:00.833 --> 30:02.248
When you're checking traps,

30:02.283 --> 30:04.664
you always expect
to catch something.

30:04.699 --> 30:07.909
But if you don't,
you're skunked.

30:07.944 --> 30:10.878
You don't get the payoff.

30:10.912 --> 30:13.742
This isn't working.

30:13.777 --> 30:15.710
There's no reason
to keep checking traps

30:15.744 --> 30:18.333
that aren't producing
when you have to fly to them.

30:22.268 --> 30:24.650
Narrator:
Marty's no stranger to setbacks,

30:24.684 --> 30:26.928
but with three weeks
of winter already burned,

30:26.963 --> 30:29.310
he needs a new strategy
and quick

30:29.344 --> 30:32.692
if he's going to turn
a profit this season.

30:32.727 --> 30:36.075
Marty:
Trapping is always in flux,

30:36.110 --> 30:39.458
so if it doesn't work,
you change what you're doing,

30:39.492 --> 30:40.873
come at it from
a different direction,

30:40.908 --> 30:43.427
try it a different way.

30:51.573 --> 30:56.647
Narrator: In North Carolina's
Blue Ridge Mountains,

30:56.682 --> 30:59.374
Eustace and Preston
assess their losses.

30:59.409 --> 31:02.274
A tornado uprooted scores
of trees meant to fuel

31:02.308 --> 31:04.793
their lumber business
for years to come.

31:18.255 --> 31:19.981
Looks pretty good so far!

31:20.016 --> 31:22.294
Yeah.

31:22.328 --> 31:25.400
Fallen timber is vulnerable
to decay and infestation

31:25.435 --> 31:27.230
that can transform
thousands of dollars

31:27.264 --> 31:30.095
of profit into nothing
more than firewood.

31:30.129 --> 31:32.580
We're gonna evaluate
every single board

31:32.614 --> 31:34.030
that comes off that mill.

31:34.064 --> 31:36.066
If it's rotten, I don't want it.

31:36.101 --> 31:39.725
We don't want wormy,
holey lumber.

31:39.759 --> 31:41.382
There's a good one.

31:41.416 --> 31:43.832
Narrator: A worm infestation
would leave the boards

31:43.867 --> 31:44.868
riddled with holes.

31:44.903 --> 31:47.664
So far, the first tree
is in the clear.

31:59.055 --> 32:00.366
Hey, Eustace!

32:06.890 --> 32:07.822
Full of worms.

32:07.856 --> 32:09.548
It's full of worms.

32:09.582 --> 32:10.963
Man, that's covered up
in them.

32:10.998 --> 32:12.413
Yeah, it's full of it.

32:12.447 --> 32:17.349
Man, I sure hope all these logs
don't have worms in them.

32:20.939 --> 32:23.182
There he is,
little devils.

32:23.217 --> 32:25.012
Eating them up,
aren't they?

32:25.046 --> 32:27.290
Preston: If you leave a tree too
long and it gets those worms

32:27.324 --> 32:28.808
and it runs throughout the tree,

32:28.843 --> 32:32.157
it bores little holes
all the way through it.

32:32.191 --> 32:34.504
We're just not gonna be
able to sell this stuff.

32:42.546 --> 32:44.997
Eustace: If this one log
has worms in it,

32:45.032 --> 32:46.930
I'm betting that
all of them have it

32:46.965 --> 32:49.588
because they all fell
at the same time, same storm.

32:49.622 --> 32:51.383
I think they're gonna
be all ruined,

32:51.417 --> 32:53.523
and I'm a little bit
worried about that.

33:05.811 --> 33:08.331
Full of worms.

33:10.574 --> 33:14.026
I never thought it was gonna
be quite as far gone as it is,

33:14.061 --> 33:16.201
but we're in trouble.

33:19.480 --> 33:21.965
Boy, that's pretty wormy,
isn't it?

33:22.000 --> 33:23.104
Yeah.

33:23.139 --> 33:24.416
Got to do
something with it.

33:24.450 --> 33:25.796
Yeah, we do.

33:25.831 --> 33:29.766
That could be a lot of money
we're losing on this.

33:29.800 --> 33:32.631
We have to try to salvage
some of this lumber.

33:32.665 --> 33:36.048
I don't know if we can even
get to it fast enough.

33:46.403 --> 33:48.647
Narrator:
On Montana's Kootenai River,

33:48.681 --> 33:49.924
following Sean's tip

33:49.958 --> 33:52.409
to these potential
beaver-trapping grounds,

33:52.444 --> 33:54.066
Tom and his apprentice
are scouring

33:54.101 --> 33:56.172
the banks for prospects.

33:56.206 --> 34:01.108
But so far, all they've found is
a string of abandoned dens.

34:01.142 --> 34:03.144
You can see lots of old sign,
where we're at,

34:03.179 --> 34:05.319
where we've come through,
you know.

34:05.353 --> 34:07.631
So you know they've got
to be here somewheres.

34:11.221 --> 34:12.912
Yeah, look at this.

34:12.947 --> 34:15.053
That looks pretty good
over in there.

34:15.087 --> 34:18.677
Looks like there's
somebody living there.

34:18.711 --> 34:20.748
Narrator:
A working den can be home

34:20.782 --> 34:22.370
to as many as a dozen beavers.

34:22.405 --> 34:24.683
Looks like a nice little
trail going up in there.

34:24.717 --> 34:25.891
Sean: Yeah, sure.

34:25.925 --> 34:27.996
It looks like a little bit
of activity, huh?

34:28.031 --> 34:28.963
Yeah.

34:28.997 --> 34:30.102
Tom:
You see these shiny sticks

34:30.137 --> 34:31.931
that don't have
bark on them.

34:31.966 --> 34:35.418
That's the sign
that you're looking for.

34:35.452 --> 34:38.938
I'm gonna put out
a leg trap in here.

34:38.973 --> 34:41.389
All right.
You want to set that one?

34:41.424 --> 34:42.804
Sure.

34:42.839 --> 34:46.498
The first set we're gonna
put in is on this trail

34:46.532 --> 34:49.432
that this beaver
came up onto the bank,

34:49.466 --> 34:51.606
and we'll set a leg trap

34:51.641 --> 34:54.195
in about 4 inches of water
right there

34:54.230 --> 34:58.475
where the beaver would step
from the water onto the land.

34:58.510 --> 34:59.890
You turn that
the other way.

34:59.925 --> 35:01.409
Yes, sir.

35:01.444 --> 35:03.101
Drive this in.

35:03.135 --> 35:06.656
The trap will be attached
to this ground cable.

35:06.690 --> 35:08.796
There'll be a slide
on this cable,

35:08.830 --> 35:10.763
so if we catch that beaver,

35:10.798 --> 35:15.009
the only direction
he can go with the trap

35:15.043 --> 35:19.013
is down the cable
into deep water.

35:20.083 --> 35:22.396
Narrator: Setting traps
below the surface

35:22.430 --> 35:24.708
helps keep the catch safe
from predators

35:24.743 --> 35:26.124
looking for an easy meal.

35:26.158 --> 35:27.884
Tom: You want to get them
down underwater

35:27.918 --> 35:29.403
where the eagles can't get them

35:29.437 --> 35:31.336
because they'll sure drag them
up and eat 'em.

35:31.370 --> 35:33.752
I've lost quite
a few beavers to eagles.

35:33.786 --> 35:37.135
And the Kootenai
is covered with eagles.

35:37.169 --> 35:40.724
Pick up a handful of mud,
throw it right there.

35:40.759 --> 35:44.452
Yeah. Now, beavers
mark their area.

35:44.487 --> 35:47.145
They'll scoop up a bunch of mud
like you just did,

35:47.179 --> 35:49.077
and they'll set it there.

35:49.112 --> 35:51.390
Then they'll climb up
on top of that pile,

35:51.425 --> 35:54.600
and they'll deposit
some of this gland lure.

35:54.635 --> 35:55.808
Got you.

35:55.843 --> 35:57.189
That's how a beaver marks
his territory

35:57.224 --> 35:59.191
like a dog
pees on tires.

35:59.226 --> 36:01.055
And that beaver will
come swimming by,

36:01.089 --> 36:04.300
and he'll smell
this new guy in town.

36:04.334 --> 36:07.199
And he'll
investigate this guy.

36:07.234 --> 36:10.547
Tom: The mountain men used
beaver caster for generations,

36:10.582 --> 36:15.173
that was what the lure was that
brought the beaver to the trap.

36:15.207 --> 36:16.277
Sean: This is really cool,

36:16.312 --> 36:18.141
learning the process
of beaver trapping.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.730
Very few people my age will
get the opportunity to learn,

36:20.764 --> 36:22.835
especially from
a mentor like Tom.

36:22.870 --> 36:24.251
Good deal.

36:24.285 --> 36:26.218
Well, we'll see if we can't
find more sign, huh?

36:26.253 --> 36:28.772
Yep.

36:31.327 --> 36:32.431
-Pull in here.
-Oh, yeah.

36:32.466 --> 36:33.984
Just check
this first part out here.

36:34.019 --> 36:35.641
Lot of sticks
in the bottom.

36:35.676 --> 36:37.471
-Oh, yeah.
-Look at all this...

36:37.505 --> 36:38.886
Lots of debris.

36:38.920 --> 36:42.027
After we find the first set,
it isn't much further downstream

36:42.061 --> 36:45.617
when it starts picking up
and we start seeing more sign.

36:45.651 --> 36:48.240
Look how much different
this looks than the last place.

36:48.275 --> 36:50.518
Right, much busier.

36:50.553 --> 36:52.140
Yep. These two holes,
I would guess,

36:52.175 --> 36:55.282
are dens that are up underneath
that brush right there.

36:55.316 --> 36:58.699
Narrator: Underwater dens
require a different technique.

36:58.733 --> 37:01.426
Tom: We're trying
to put this trap

37:01.460 --> 37:05.188
down over the entrance of a den
that's down below.

37:05.223 --> 37:08.743
We're gonna put a conibear
in each entrance

37:08.778 --> 37:10.089
of this beaver den.

37:10.124 --> 37:12.160
Okay?

37:12.195 --> 37:14.853
A conibear, they're about
a 10-inch square trap.

37:14.887 --> 37:17.511
Compress the springs,
open up the trap,

37:17.545 --> 37:20.928
and then you put sticks
into the springs

37:20.962 --> 37:25.415
and stand this trap up
in their swim passageway

37:25.450 --> 37:28.901
that they're going up
into their den.

37:28.936 --> 37:30.938
Right in front
of that den?

37:30.972 --> 37:34.562
I think it is, yeah.

37:34.597 --> 37:36.806
Yeah, that's going down
there good, I think.

37:36.840 --> 37:38.290
Okay, want to do
this one, too, or...

37:38.325 --> 37:39.602
Yeah, might as well.

37:39.636 --> 37:43.640
There's, like, three entrances
going into this den,

37:43.675 --> 37:49.646
and we put a big conibear
on two of the passages.

37:49.681 --> 37:51.407
-Two good sets.
-All right.

37:51.441 --> 37:53.098
Maybe we'll get a double
then tomorrow.

37:53.132 --> 37:54.272
Well,
that'd be neat to do.

37:54.306 --> 37:56.791
Wouldn't that
be something?

37:56.826 --> 37:59.622
If this works out good,
it could be a new trapping spot

37:59.656 --> 38:01.693
for years to come.

38:01.727 --> 38:04.040
I don't know how many
more years I got coming,

38:04.074 --> 38:06.387
but, as long
as I got some coming,

38:06.422 --> 38:08.941
we'll be out there trapping.

38:15.707 --> 38:18.088
Narrator: In Alaska,
as daylight fades

38:18.123 --> 38:20.263
and temperatures
drop to minus 20,

38:20.298 --> 38:22.783
Morgan and Margaret hit
the final stretch

38:22.817 --> 38:25.510
of their supply run
back to their homestead.

38:29.341 --> 38:30.584
Margaret: Cold.

38:30.618 --> 38:32.206
Yeah, let's stop up
here in the trees,

38:32.240 --> 38:34.691
maybe get our lights out
in case we need them.

38:34.726 --> 38:38.350
Morgan: We got through the worst
water crossings and ice.

38:38.385 --> 38:40.490
Now we're just kind of
onto our more narrow

38:40.525 --> 38:43.873
trail closer to the homestead.

38:43.907 --> 38:45.599
It's getting dark.

38:45.633 --> 38:47.221
The horses have
great night vision.

38:47.255 --> 38:48.705
They can walk really
well in the dark.

38:48.740 --> 38:51.225
You just got to trust
them and relax

38:51.259 --> 38:53.331
because they'll
get you home if they can.

38:55.712 --> 38:57.231
How are you doing
back there?

38:57.265 --> 38:58.888
Margaret: Good.
Been a long day.

38:58.922 --> 39:02.340
Yeah, it has.
Let's get these horses home.

39:02.374 --> 39:05.515
Okay. One little stretch,
just another mile.

39:11.832 --> 39:14.628
Morgan: We're back onto some
really familiar ground.

39:14.662 --> 39:16.146
Everyone's real tired.

39:16.181 --> 39:18.148
It's been a long day
for Margaret,

39:18.183 --> 39:20.219
not quite as long
of a day for me.

39:25.259 --> 39:26.778
Easy does it.

39:26.812 --> 39:28.676
Ooh, good girl.

39:28.711 --> 39:31.230
Ooh.

39:33.440 --> 39:34.544
Here, Margaret, here.

39:34.579 --> 39:37.271
Let's get these
horses unsaddled.

39:40.550 --> 39:43.139
Check the...Oh.

39:43.173 --> 39:45.313
Looks like
she got a scrape.

39:47.177 --> 39:48.524
Even though it's been
a long day,

39:48.558 --> 39:50.836
when you've got horses,
they've got to come first.

39:52.459 --> 39:53.908
Yeah, it's over here.

39:56.704 --> 39:57.843
Looks like some scrapes.

39:57.878 --> 39:59.673
Put a little salve on it.

39:59.707 --> 40:01.260
Margaret: It's really important
to take care of things

40:01.295 --> 40:02.779
just as soon as they happen,

40:02.814 --> 40:04.712
jump on injuries as soon
as possible to make sure

40:04.747 --> 40:07.474
you kick any potential
infection in the bud.

40:07.508 --> 40:08.751
That's the way to go.

40:08.785 --> 40:09.959
This is a cottonwood salve.

40:09.993 --> 40:12.237
It's antibacterial,
antimicrobial.

40:12.271 --> 40:14.135
Going to help kill
some of that bacteria.

40:14.170 --> 40:16.966
Morgan: This will help protect
the scrape from windburn.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.036
Yeah.

40:18.070 --> 40:19.071
We use it on ourselves
all the time.

40:19.106 --> 40:20.866
Yeah.

40:20.901 --> 40:22.799
It really heals
things up nicely.

40:22.834 --> 40:25.388
Morgan: A lot can happen on
the trail with horses.

40:25.423 --> 40:26.596
They could get hurt.

40:26.631 --> 40:28.529
You need to do a good job
taking care of them.

40:28.564 --> 40:32.464
Lucha did get a scrape on her
face, probably in the brush.

40:32.499 --> 40:37.814
Wasn't too bad, but we put some
salve on it and called it good.

40:37.849 --> 40:40.472
Whoa, Nicety, I know.

40:40.507 --> 40:41.956
Yeah, he's hungry.

40:41.991 --> 40:43.579
I can't tell you what
a good feeling it is

40:43.613 --> 40:45.650
to get plenty of feed

40:45.684 --> 40:48.135
stocked up in the barn
before winter.

40:48.169 --> 40:49.481
You know, you feel secure.

40:49.516 --> 40:53.312
You feel rich, and it's
just got that base covered.

40:53.347 --> 40:55.936
You can turn around
and focus on something else.

40:55.970 --> 40:57.972
-Welcome back.
-Thank you, yeah.

40:58.007 --> 41:00.665
Morgan: Like what you've done
with the place.

41:00.699 --> 41:02.736
I'm glad this trip went well,

41:02.770 --> 41:05.877
and we're all back safe
and in one piece.

41:09.467 --> 41:11.641
Narrator:
Next time on "Mountain Men"...

41:11.676 --> 41:13.194
Jason: I got my family living
in a tent.

41:13.229 --> 41:15.714
Winter's nipping at my heels.

41:15.749 --> 41:17.336
I've got to
figure out something.

41:17.371 --> 41:22.031
Narrator: ...Jason's search
for land becomes a real hunt.

41:22.065 --> 41:24.861
I got him!

41:24.896 --> 41:27.485
Narrator: ...Rich's depleted
dog team bites off

41:27.519 --> 41:28.658
more than it can chew...

41:28.693 --> 41:30.142
Rich: Holy crap!

41:30.177 --> 41:33.007
There's a cat in a tree!

41:33.042 --> 41:36.666
Narrator: ...and Eustace blasts
a roadblock with black powder.

41:36.701 --> 41:38.530
-Go for broke.
-Go for broke.

41:38.565 --> 41:40.221
You got your
running shoes on?

41:40.256 --> 41:42.776
Preston: Yeah.
I guess I'm ready.
