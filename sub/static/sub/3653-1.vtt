considered questionable.

16:40.280 --> 16:41.361
Yeah.

16:41.560 --> 16:44.040
But we're gonna help
a lot of people with this work.

16:45.040 --> 16:47.202
It's gonna be worth it, OK?

16:47.400 --> 16:48.845

Did you see a big white light? Huh?

18:35.000 --> 18:37.241
You know,
that part's actually true.

18:37.400 --> 18:40.370
- You know what the pineal gland is?
- No.

18:40.520 --> 18:44.002
It produces DMT, which is
the base compound for our serum.

18:44.160 --> 18:46.731
Basically, nobody knows why,
but the moment you die,

18:46.880 --> 18:51.283
right then, your brain just floods your
system with this massive blast of DMT,

18:51.480 --> 18:54.006
which is the most potent psychedelic
on the planet.

18:54.160 --> 18:57.607
And when you think you're seeing
the light at the end of the tunnel,

18:57.760 --> 19:00.969
- or the blessed Virgin Mary, um...

19:01.160 --> 19:02.400
- FRANK: Did I do that the wrong way?
- Mm-mm.

19:02.560 --> 19:06.042
Anyway, it's just a big trip that
you're having, really, it's all it is.

19:06.840 --> 19:09.161
- I disagree. I do.
- FRANK: Oh, you disagree, really?

19:09.320 --> 19:12.529
- We've had this discussion before.
- Yeah, I just think you can't discount

19:12.680 --> 19:14.887
every near-death experience
based on one theory.

19:15.040 --> 19:16.610
FRANK: Of course.
But if you're going to make a bet,

19:16.800 --> 19:18.768
why not bet on a scientific theory

19:18.920 --> 19:22.481
as opposed to, you know,
St. Peter and the pearly white gates?

19:22.680 --> 19:24.523
- Why?
- Because one is empirical and one is,

19:24.720 --> 19:26.563
you know, it's a cute story, but it's...

19:26.720 --> 19:29.640
No, it's not. I mean, whatever you
wanna call it, the soul, consciousness,

19:29.680 --> 19:34.288
it's just neural impulses firing in
your brain, right? That makes it energy.

19:34.480 --> 19:36.005
Energy can't be created or destroyed,

19:36.160 --> 19:38.606
it can just be transformed
from one thing to another.

19:38.760 --> 19:41.286
So that's not superstition,
that's science.

19:41.440 --> 19:42.930
EVA: So what's your theory?

19:43.640 --> 19:48.407
I think, maybe when we die, the DMT
is there to help our souls move on,

19:48.560 --> 19:50.483
to get them wherever
they're supposed to be.

19:50.640 --> 19:55.601
- You know, open the door for them.
- So the DMT is like a doorman

19:55.760 --> 19:57.683
who is like,
"Here. Here's life, here's death.

19:57.880 --> 19:59.484
I'm gonna open this up
and usher you through."

19:59.640 --> 20:01.005
- Maybe.
- And you give him a tip.

20:01.160 --> 20:03.527
I just think it's arrogant
to reduce everything that happens

20:03.720 --> 20:06.769
at the moment of death
to one chemical equation.

20:06.920 --> 20:08.410
The fact is, we just don't know.

OK, so far, we've seen
three distinct phases of development.

23:44.880 --> 23:50.011
Phase one: Subject is resuscitated

23:50.160 --> 23:52.686

23:52.840 --> 23:57.129
Phase two: The serum remains in
the bloodstream longer than anticipated.

23:57.280 --> 23:58.884
Phase three: Metabolic functions

23:59.080 --> 24:01.651
produce a potentially disruptive
hormonal imbalance.

Subject shows signs of confusion,

continues to create new neural pathways

Don't play the religious card.
This has nothing to do with religion.

25:13.760 --> 25:16.923

to do an unsanctioned experiment,

25:17.080 --> 25:18.889
in direct violation of the Review Board

25:19.040 --> 25:20.963

which you signed.

going to "study new methods

of arresting neural decay
in coma patients."

25:26.360 --> 25:28.567
Yes, exactly! That is how it started.

was discovered? Or Teflon?

about the Lazarus serum.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.889

that's the first thing right there.

OK, OK, all right, you're OK.
Come here. Come here. You're OK.

47:04.720 --> 47:07.769
- No. No, I'm not OK. I'm not OK.
- You're OK. You're all right.

47:07.920 --> 47:09.046
Something's happening.

47:09.200 --> 47:11.362
- Something happened. I'm changing.
- OK, OK...

47:11.520 --> 47:13.602
OK, shh. Calm down.
What's happening?

47:13.760 --> 47:16.366
(WHISPERS)
I can hear things. I can see things.

47:16.560 --> 47:17.721
Look, look at my hand.

47:20.120 --> 47:21.281
Wait...

47:22.880 --> 47:27.886
- There's nothing wrong with your hand.
- Frank, when I died, I went somewhere.

47:29.440 --> 47:31.090
I was in the building. I was there.

47:31.280 --> 47:32.884
I could hear the people,
they were stuck!

47:33.040 --> 47:34.565
Zoe, that was a dream.

47:34.720 --> 47:37.040
It's a traumatic memory
from your childhood. It's not real.

47:37.120 --> 47:40.488
That's what I thought.
I couldn't wake up.

47:40.640 --> 47:43.325
I was stuck.
It was endless. I tried.

47:43.480 --> 47:46.404
It went on and on.
And every day, I was there.

47:46.560 --> 47:48.528
It was the same, over and over.
Every single day.

47:48.680 --> 47:50.523
Zoe, you were gone
for less than an hour.

47:50.720 --> 47:53.803
- You were right here. You didn't...
- Oh, no, no. You don't understand.

47:53.960 --> 47:58.124
It's been years.
I've been in there for years.

48:01.120 --> 48:03.168
Look, listen to me, OK?

48:03.320 --> 48:05.721
Your brain was failing
due to the lack of oxygen.

48:05.880 --> 48:07.564
You're hallucinating from the DMT.

48:07.720 --> 48:09.722
This is a terrible memory
from your childhood,

48:09.880 --> 48:12.724
- but it's playing in a traumatic loop.
- No. It was hell.

48:13.800 --> 48:15.802
That's what hell is.

48:16.520 --> 48:21.287
You relive the worst moment of your life
on a loop, over and over,

48:21.440 --> 48:23.442
and you can never wake up.

48:24.560 --> 48:28.326
Listen, you're here.
You are here now and you are awake.

48:31.440 --> 48:33.169
You're fine.

48:36.720 --> 48:38.404
- Yeah.
- OK.

48:50.600 --> 48:52.523
OK.

48:54.480 --> 48:57.962

in an apartment,

- Frank?

You wanna tell us what's going on here?

- Frank! What the hell's going on, man?
- (STAMMERS) I... You...

52:18.720 --> 52:20.440

52:22.240 --> 52:24.527
- No.
- CLAY: What? Told her what?

52:24.680 --> 52:26.921
Look, when Zoe was a little girl,

52:27.120 --> 52:29.771
the apartment building she lived in
caught on fire

52:29.920 --> 52:32.526
and her neighbors
got trapped behind a door.

52:33.520 --> 52:35.841
She still has nightmares about it.

(WHISPERS) Yeah.

52:41.200 --> 52:45.091
How's that even possible?
How's that possible, Frank?

52:45.240 --> 52:51.247
Zoe said... after you die,
your body creates... like a compound,

52:51.400 --> 52:54.324
- and it helps your soul move on or...
- DMT.

52:54.520 --> 52:55.521
Right.

52:55.680 --> 52:57.489
She said it opens a door
to somewhere else.

52:57.640 --> 53:01.804

53:01.960 --> 53:04.611

I'm telling you, it's the serum.

It's... It's like...

There's a reason why evolution
happens really slowly.

- What am I looking at here?
- I logged in as an admin

so I could scrub through
the security footage, and I found this.
