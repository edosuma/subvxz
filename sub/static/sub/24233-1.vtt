01:03.920 --> 01:05.639
<i>All right,
think good thoughts.</i>

01:05.720 --> 01:07.359
<i>Then on three,
let the good thought go.</i>

01:08.040 --> 01:09.030
Yeah. That's good.

01:09.120 --> 01:10.110
I think that's pretty, right?

01:10.280 --> 01:12.431
That's gonna be a good luck
charm for us today, right?

01:12.600 --> 01:14.239
Okay, Meg,
important question.

01:14.400 --> 01:15.834
Van Halen or Bono? Bono?

01:16.000 --> 01:17.320
- That one.
- That's what I thought.

01:17.400 --> 01:19.710
That's my girl. Whoo!

01:20.320 --> 01:22.994
Oh, yeah! Stick your
tongue out, come on.

01:23.080 --> 01:25.117
Ah!

01:25.240 --> 01:27.471
You got your frequency,
you got your voltage, okay?

01:27.640 --> 01:29.472
<i>They're like a salt silica,
right? You don't wanna eat it.</i>

01:29.640 --> 01:31.393
- Just go crazy with it.
- Yeah.

01:31.720 --> 01:33.279
...this little gizmo
right here,

01:33.360 --> 01:34.589
and we're gonna
choose a frequency.

01:34.760 --> 01:35.910
<i>We're gonna choose
the frequency.</i>

01:36.000 --> 01:37.116
<i>You would intently
watch this plate.</i>

01:37.600 --> 01:38.795
<i>Let's see what happens
to the sand.</i>

01:38.960 --> 01:40.474
<i>Because very interesting,
magical things</i>

01:40.560 --> 01:41.835
<i>- will happen to the sand.</i>
- Whoa!

01:46.520 --> 01:47.795
So...

01:50.240 --> 01:51.959
are you ready to meet
your new brother?

01:52.640 --> 01:54.199
Do you think
we'll like each other,

01:54.280 --> 01:56.636
like real brothers
and sisters?

01:57.360 --> 01:59.192
I think we'll all
love each other.

02:01.160 --> 02:04.198
Out of this wide,
wide universe...

02:04.800 --> 02:06.757
this huge universe...

02:07.840 --> 02:09.638
with all these brothers

02:09.720 --> 02:12.792
and sisters and moms
and dads...

02:15.160 --> 02:16.753
he found us.

02:17.560 --> 02:19.870
And we found each other.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.190
<i>That's pretty rare.</i>

02:21.360 --> 02:22.510
<i>That's pretty cool.</i>

02:24.120 --> 02:26.032
Okay, so...

02:26.200 --> 02:29.352
This is our love.

02:35.200 --> 02:36.236
Don't worry.

02:36.400 --> 02:37.629
It's not gone.

02:37.840 --> 02:40.560
It's just...
It's just enfolded.

02:41.280 --> 02:42.999
Love is always there.

02:43.160 --> 02:45.038
Even if you don't feel it...

02:47.120 --> 02:49.589
it's always there for you.

03:31.160 --> 03:32.594
Not gone...

03:40.360 --> 03:41.919
just enfolded.

04:00.480 --> 04:01.470
Hey.

04:02.040 --> 04:03.030
Hi, Meg.

04:03.720 --> 04:05.393
Let's be exclusive.

04:06.880 --> 04:07.870
What?

04:08.040 --> 04:11.317
That's my new word
for the day. Exclusive.

04:11.520 --> 04:12.510
Do you like it?

04:14.480 --> 04:16.072
Love it, Biscuits.

04:20.440 --> 04:22.033
Couldn't sleep either?

04:23.480 --> 04:25.631
Why didn't you just come up
to my room?

04:26.360 --> 04:28.272
'Cause I knew
you'd be down.

04:33.160 --> 04:35.834
Hey. You made sandwiches.

04:36.040 --> 04:37.599
And I'm cooking milk.

04:38.760 --> 04:41.400
This is a lot of milk,
Charles Wallace.

04:41.560 --> 04:43.517
It's good to be prepared.

04:43.720 --> 04:46.110
You never know
who will stop by.

04:47.360 --> 04:48.874
<i>And I'm Michele Norris.</i>

04:49.040 --> 04:51.430
<i>Tomorrow marks
the four-year anniversary...</i>

04:51.640 --> 04:55.475
<i>of the disappearance of NASA
scientist Dr. Alex Murry.</i>

04:55.640 --> 04:56.835
<i>Dr. Murry went missing</i>

04:56.920 --> 04:57.910
<i>just a week
after publicly announcing...</i>

04:58.080 --> 04:59.230
They're talking
about Daddy.

04:59.440 --> 05:01.716
<i>...he could travel
the universe with his mind.</i>

05:01.880 --> 05:04.475
<i>91
billion light-years traveled,</i>

05:04.560 --> 05:05.630
<i>like that.</i>

05:05.800 --> 05:08.269
<i>Authorities
note there are still</i>

05:08.360 --> 05:10.477
<i>no leads in the case.</i>

05:19.960 --> 05:21.553
Everybody say,
"Hi, Meg."

05:21.720 --> 05:23.279
Hi, Meg.

05:27.360 --> 05:28.396
Hi, Meg.

06:11.280 --> 06:12.396
I mean, he's been gone

06:12.480 --> 06:14.073
four years to the day.

06:14.240 --> 06:16.118
He's probably just pretending
to be in outer space...

06:16.280 --> 06:18.237
but he's really
hiding out in Tijuana.

06:18.440 --> 06:20.193
I bet
it involves another woman.

06:20.400 --> 06:21.629
Either that
or a Martian.

06:21.800 --> 06:24.190
Seriously though,
something so horrible

06:24.320 --> 06:25.390
had to have happened
to him.

06:25.560 --> 06:26.880
To leave his kids
like that?

06:27.040 --> 06:29.191
And just after
they adopted Charles Wallace.

06:29.720 --> 06:31.234
They seemed so happy.

06:31.400 --> 06:34.518
And Meg used to be so engaged,
and now she is a mess.

06:34.680 --> 06:36.080
But the boy is brilliant.

06:36.240 --> 06:38.596
- Absolutely brilliant. Oh.
- But odd, so odd!

06:38.680 --> 06:39.670
I guess
I would be too

06:39.760 --> 06:40.750
if my dad ran away, huh?

06:41.240 --> 06:43.197
Shame on you
for talking like that!

06:44.240 --> 06:45.799
Uh... Oh.
My dear, I'm sorry...

06:45.880 --> 06:46.870
And I'm not odd, you are...

06:47.040 --> 06:49.316
because you think making up
mean stories about people...

06:49.480 --> 06:50.880
makes you feel better
about yourselves.

06:51.040 --> 06:52.554
Well, it doesn't,
does it?

06:52.760 --> 06:54.672
Charles Wallace, we don't
talk to teachers like that!

06:54.840 --> 06:56.035
And Meg might be a mess...

06:56.200 --> 06:57.759
but she has
more potential in her pinky...

06:57.920 --> 06:59.593
than you do
in your whole body!

07:00.360 --> 07:02.636
Did you hear that, Meg? Meg!

07:02.800 --> 07:06.430
Over here. Did you hear that?
Meg! You may be a mess...

07:06.600 --> 07:08.910
but you have more potential
than anybody here!

07:10.040 --> 07:11.633
Oh, no, no, no.

07:11.800 --> 07:12.790
Mommy was awkward

07:12.880 --> 07:14.109
and funny-looking
at your age, too!

07:14.560 --> 07:17.598
And look at her now.
She's beautiful!

07:21.240 --> 07:24.278
So, looks like crazy
runs in the family.

07:27.440 --> 07:28.635
What did you just say?

07:30.240 --> 07:31.959
I see why your dad left.

07:34.760 --> 07:36.831
Who does she even think
that she's talking to?

07:37.000 --> 07:38.150
Hey, Veronica.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.597
You're next, Charles Wallace.

08:02.280 --> 08:05.796
Veronica Kiley's
parents are on their way here.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.310
They're worried for
their daughter's safety.

08:08.480 --> 08:10.278
Their daughter is mean.

08:12.440 --> 08:14.193
You hit her in the face.

08:26.320 --> 08:27.674
You...

08:27.800 --> 08:29.075
You were a top student.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.314
Top attitude.

08:31.840 --> 08:33.354
But look at you now. You...

08:34.559 --> 08:36.870
You're aggressive,
you're hostile...

08:37.039 --> 08:38.269
you shut everybody out...

08:38.960 --> 08:41.030
and then wonder
why they don't like you.

08:42.039 --> 08:44.430
I don't wonder
and I don't care.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.470
Hmm.

08:47.640 --> 08:48.630
Well...

08:49.720 --> 08:51.677
maybe that's your problem.

08:52.200 --> 08:53.839
I don't have a problem.

08:54.920 --> 08:56.877
You can't keep using
your father's disappearance

08:56.960 --> 08:58.599
as an excuse to act out.

08:59.480 --> 09:01.153
What do you think he would say
about all this?

09:01.320 --> 09:04.279
Seriously. If he walked
in that door today...

09:05.480 --> 09:06.630
what would happen?

09:10.600 --> 09:12.910
The world would
make sense again.

09:17.800 --> 09:20.156
Listen.

09:20.240 --> 09:23.472
All I'm saying is,
it's been four years.

09:26.320 --> 09:29.916
Odds are he's not
coming back.

09:37.160 --> 09:39.675
I did not excuse you,
young lady. Meg.

09:40.320 --> 09:42.835
I want you to write an apology
to Principal Jenkins.

09:47.440 --> 09:49.272
And one to Veronica.

09:50.640 --> 09:51.710
Mom!

09:52.400 --> 09:54.676
She called
Charles Wallace crazy!

09:54.840 --> 09:56.559
That's no excuse.

10:01.280 --> 10:02.396
Well, Dad always told me

10:02.480 --> 10:04.119
to stand up
for what I believe in.

10:12.240 --> 10:14.357
Don't use Dad like that.

10:15.240 --> 10:16.913
It's not fair.

10:23.400 --> 10:26.154
He's not coming back,
is he?

10:34.680 --> 10:37.275
Don't give up hope, Meglet.

10:40.480 --> 10:42.836
I knew
it was you! Come on in.

10:43.520 --> 10:46.718
Wow! Talk about
a dark and stormy night.

10:46.880 --> 10:49.600
Are those
Mrs. Buncombe's sheets?

10:49.760 --> 10:50.750
Maybe.

10:56.880 --> 10:57.836
Excuse me.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.435
Oh, aren't you dazzling!
You must be Dr. Murry.

11:00.600 --> 11:02.000
Yes. And...

11:02.160 --> 11:03.833
Your house is so warm.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.992
You've done a wonderful job
keeping the darkness out.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.232
Mom. Mom!

11:09.400 --> 11:11.357
Do you want me to call 911?

11:11.560 --> 11:13.358
Well, almost all the darkness.

11:13.520 --> 11:15.034
You must be Meg.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.473
How... How do you
know my name?

11:17.640 --> 11:18.756
Because I told her.

11:18.840 --> 11:20.638
Guys, calm down.

11:20.800 --> 11:22.996
Don't worry.
She's my friend.

11:24.120 --> 11:25.759
Call me Mrs. Whatsit.

11:26.880 --> 11:27.950
Mrs. Who?

11:28.320 --> 11:29.674
No, Mrs. Whatsit.

11:29.840 --> 11:31.320
Mrs. Who is...

11:31.480 --> 11:32.709
She's, like,
a billion years older

11:32.800 --> 11:33.950
and way more
knowledgeable.

11:34.760 --> 11:37.958
What can I do for you,
Mrs. Whatsit?

11:38.800 --> 11:40.120
I caught her stealing sheets.

11:40.280 --> 11:42.158
Guys, she's harmless.

11:42.320 --> 11:44.630
You're six. Come on.

11:44.800 --> 11:46.120
What do you know
about harmless?

11:46.280 --> 11:47.953
Have I ever been wrong?

11:48.120 --> 11:50.316
One of these days,
you might be, Charles Wallace.

11:50.520 --> 11:51.510
Oh, I highly doubt that.

11:51.680 --> 11:53.797
He's one of the greatest minds
in recent history.

11:54.520 --> 11:55.795
He's prodigious.

11:56.280 --> 11:59.478
But of course, we can't take
any credit for our talents.

11:59.640 --> 12:01.996
It's how we use them
that counts.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.671
Okay, then.
The thing is...

12:07.120 --> 12:10.192
we don't know you,
and it's late, so...

12:10.720 --> 12:13.315
Oh, is it?
I'm terrible with time.

12:14.200 --> 12:16.192
Mrs. Which
usually handles that.

12:16.880 --> 12:18.394
Uh... Right.

12:18.520 --> 12:19.795
Um...

12:19.880 --> 12:20.916
The thing is, uh...

12:21.560 --> 12:24.519
the kids need
to get to bed...

12:24.720 --> 12:27.315
so if you don't mind
visiting some other time.

12:28.800 --> 12:30.837
Oh, of course I will.

12:32.080 --> 12:34.834
I just wanna tell you
one thing before I go.

12:42.440 --> 12:44.830
I want you to know
that no matter what happens...

12:46.360 --> 12:49.956
you and your husband achieved
something truly extraordinary.

12:51.280 --> 12:53.317
What are you
talking about?

12:53.480 --> 12:55.039
Just that there really is

12:55.120 --> 12:57.874
such a thing
as a tesseract.

12:58.960 --> 13:00.030
What?

13:04.520 --> 13:06.477
A tesseract?

13:06.680 --> 13:08.751
That's what I said.
Tesseract.

13:08.920 --> 13:11.435
Is... Is this
some kind of joke?

13:11.640 --> 13:13.757
Did Veronica
put you up to this?

13:13.920 --> 13:16.480
You really don't
trust easily, do you?

13:16.560 --> 13:17.676
Hmm.

13:18.240 --> 13:20.118
Charles Wallace,
I'm not sure about Meg.

13:20.480 --> 13:21.960
Give her a chance.

13:22.600 --> 13:23.795
Okay.

13:23.960 --> 13:25.713
You're the boss.

13:25.880 --> 13:27.553
I better run.

13:29.760 --> 13:33.390
Ah! Wild nights are my glory.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.639
Never do that again.

13:54.800 --> 13:57.872
Never let anyone in the house
without our permission.

13:58.040 --> 14:02.034
And please stop talking
to strangers.

14:02.200 --> 14:04.157
I don't
talk to them, they talk to me.

14:04.360 --> 14:05.919
Doesn't mean
you have to answer.

14:06.080 --> 14:08.311
Now,
that's just bad manners, Meg.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.153
Charles Wallace.

14:10.320 --> 14:11.356
Hey, buddy!

14:11.520 --> 14:12.590
How's it going?

14:12.760 --> 14:14.080
I'm cool.

14:14.960 --> 14:16.394
Hello, princess.

14:18.760 --> 14:20.513
See?
Told ya.

14:20.600 --> 14:22.478
Yeah, be yourself.

14:25.800 --> 14:27.393
Don't be like me.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.593
What's wrong
with being like you?

14:31.360 --> 14:32.874
You have a pretty good arm.

14:34.560 --> 14:35.516
Veronica.

14:36.200 --> 14:37.475
Direct hit.

14:40.400 --> 14:42.232
Hi. I'm Charles Wallace,
Meg's brother.

14:42.440 --> 14:44.238
- You're Calvin, aren't you?
- That I am.

14:45.760 --> 14:47.433
What are you doing here?

14:48.040 --> 14:49.633
I don't know.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.313
I was doing my homework...

14:52.480 --> 14:53.630
and suddenly
I got this feeling

14:53.720 --> 14:54.836
that I had to come here.

14:55.880 --> 14:57.155
Like, right here.

14:57.520 --> 14:58.556
Is that weird?

15:00.120 --> 15:01.634
Maybe a little.

15:01.840 --> 15:04.560
The truth is,
you were called here.

15:04.720 --> 15:06.359
You're good at diplomacy.

15:07.160 --> 15:09.516
What do we need diplomacy for,
Charles Wallace?

15:09.720 --> 15:12.076
Well, the fact that you asked
is exactly why we need it.

15:13.200 --> 15:15.078
So what do you say, Calvin,
you wanna come with us?

15:18.080 --> 15:18.991
Sure.

15:19.480 --> 15:20.630
Why not?

15:22.200 --> 15:23.236
Great.

15:23.440 --> 15:25.352
Let's go meet Mrs. Who.

15:26.120 --> 15:28.351
No! No, Charles Wallace!

15:28.520 --> 15:30.079
Charles Wallace,
do not go in there.

15:30.600 --> 15:33.160
That house is falling apart,
it's off-limits.

15:33.480 --> 15:35.437
He's a fearless little guy.

15:35.520 --> 15:37.432
Unfortunately.

15:39.520 --> 15:41.079
I told you no.

15:41.240 --> 15:43.436
We cannot go in there.
It's not safe.

15:43.880 --> 15:46.634
It's practically
the safest place...

15:46.840 --> 15:48.479
in the universe.

15:53.240 --> 15:54.435
Look.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.439
Mrs. Who, it's me,
Charles Wallace.

16:12.520 --> 16:14.512
Oh.

16:33.720 --> 16:35.473
"Life without love...

16:35.680 --> 16:38.400
"is like a tree
without blossoms or fruit."

16:39.360 --> 16:41.829
Gibran, Lebanese.

16:43.880 --> 16:46.315
Calvin. Uh, American.

16:46.680 --> 16:47.750
Mrs. Who prefers

16:47.840 --> 16:49.399
not to think for herself.

16:49.560 --> 16:52.234
That's just rude,
Charles Wallace.

16:52.400 --> 16:54.915
No. She's just evolved
past language...

16:55.080 --> 16:56.799
so when
she needs to think...

16:56.960 --> 16:59.759
she cheats and uses
other people's words.

16:59.920 --> 17:01.400
It's nice how
she gives them credit.

17:01.960 --> 17:04.953
Mrs. Who, meet my Meg.

17:09.480 --> 17:10.470
Okay.

17:11.640 --> 17:12.675
Okay.

17:16.599 --> 17:20.560
"The wound is the place
where the light enters you."

17:22.800 --> 17:25.269
Rumi, Persian.

17:34.040 --> 17:35.838
Poor Mrs. Who.

17:35.920 --> 17:37.149
We tired her out.

17:37.480 --> 17:39.392
I guess she was
really tired.

17:40.760 --> 17:41.910
She's still adjusting.

17:42.440 --> 17:44.193
Adjusting to what?

17:45.320 --> 17:47.073
Sorry, you're almost,

17:47.160 --> 17:49.038
but not quite ready
to find out.

17:49.120 --> 17:50.076
Charles Wallace...

17:50.240 --> 17:51.230
whatever she is,

17:51.320 --> 17:53.277
whatever that is,
whatever all this is...

17:53.440 --> 17:54.556
I don't like it.

17:54.760 --> 17:55.830
You'll manage.

17:57.560 --> 18:00.120
Come on, time to go.
Let's let Mrs. Who rest.

18:01.200 --> 18:03.431
We'll see her again
very soon.

18:08.280 --> 18:09.430
Charles Wallace,
can you, um,

18:09.520 --> 18:10.749
pass me the pepper, please?

18:11.520 --> 18:12.920
Thank you.

18:13.080 --> 18:14.480
So, they met in college.

18:14.560 --> 18:15.960
She was tutoring him.

18:16.120 --> 18:17.952
It's a great story,
actually.

18:18.120 --> 18:19.395
Oh, really?

18:19.960 --> 18:21.553
Is that his work?

18:24.080 --> 18:25.639
Mommy's, too.

18:25.800 --> 18:26.790
Cool.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.079
What's it about?

18:34.960 --> 18:36.110
Well...

18:37.480 --> 18:40.154
I'm mostly interested
in the small...

18:41.360 --> 18:43.591
atoms, particles...

18:44.080 --> 18:48.154
<i>the unseeable energies
that move through us all.</i>

18:48.320 --> 18:49.834
Go get 'em.

18:50.280 --> 18:53.432
<i>Their dad
is all about the big.</i>

18:58.600 --> 19:02.355
<i>So, what if
we are here for a reason?</i>

19:03.200 --> 19:05.351
What if we are not just
in the universe...

19:05.520 --> 19:09.480
but the universe
is within all of us?

19:09.640 --> 19:11.711
Think about
quantum entanglement.

19:11.920 --> 19:14.594
Two electrons
once bonded together,

19:14.680 --> 19:16.000
in love, if you will...

19:16.160 --> 19:18.117
suddenly separated
by a galaxy...

19:18.280 --> 19:20.556
but somehow
still just as connected.

19:21.120 --> 19:25.080
An unbroken union
despite being galaxies apart.

19:25.240 --> 19:26.959
And our most
recent calculations show us

19:27.040 --> 19:29.396
that these fields
connect us...

19:29.600 --> 19:31.717
to other dimensions.

19:31.880 --> 19:33.872
Dimensions outside
of the limitations

19:33.960 --> 19:35.110
of space and time.

19:35.280 --> 19:36.953
Imagine that. Imagine...

19:37.120 --> 19:38.952
rather than enduring
the oppressive rules

19:39.040 --> 19:42.112
of time and space,
we could wrinkle it.

19:42.320 --> 19:46.553
91 billion light-years
traveled, like that.

19:48.840 --> 19:50.160
And we don't need rockets.

19:50.320 --> 19:52.152
We don't need spaceships.
We don't need anything.

19:52.240 --> 19:54.197
To utilize a tesseract...

19:54.360 --> 19:58.479
all you need is to tap into
the right frequency.

19:58.880 --> 20:01.156
You just need your mind.

20:10.440 --> 20:12.909
He wanted
to touch the stars...

20:13.480 --> 20:15.551
unlock the secrets
of the universe...

20:15.720 --> 20:17.473
Find its origin and...

20:19.000 --> 20:20.673
shake its hand.

20:23.480 --> 20:25.233
You messed up.

20:25.400 --> 20:26.470
You were impatient.

20:26.640 --> 20:28.120
You couldn't follow the plan.

20:28.280 --> 20:29.714
Couldn't you see it
in their eyes?

20:29.800 --> 20:31.075
It was written
all over their faces.

20:31.240 --> 20:32.594
They weren't ready.

20:32.760 --> 20:34.035
They're not...

20:34.200 --> 20:36.510
Kate, they're not ready,
so what are we supposed to do?

20:36.680 --> 20:38.717
We're supposed to wait
until they catch up with us?

20:38.920 --> 20:42.152
We are on the precipice
of something spectacular!

20:42.320 --> 20:44.232
Listen, listen, listen.
Look. Hear me out.

20:44.840 --> 20:47.833
So, in order to be great...

20:48.000 --> 20:50.469
it isn't enough
just to be right.

20:50.680 --> 20:53.832
You have to actually
be great.

20:55.880 --> 20:57.553
And we are.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.152
So, why can't we help
the others along?

21:04.200 --> 21:05.190
Yes.

21:09.720 --> 21:12.235
Or we could just
beat them up.

21:12.400 --> 21:13.754
Let's beat them up.

21:13.960 --> 21:15.440
Honestly, it'd be
so much fun.

21:15.600 --> 21:18.479
Come here. Come here.

21:18.640 --> 21:19.676
Oh, God.

21:20.600 --> 21:23.320
I almost lost you.
I got so scared.

21:23.480 --> 21:25.233
You crazy,
brilliant scientist.

21:35.960 --> 21:37.872
You know,
you have great hair.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.436
What?

21:42.000 --> 21:43.150
No, I don't.

21:43.720 --> 21:44.915
Please don't say that.

21:45.760 --> 21:46.750
Okay.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.719
I had a great time.

21:55.680 --> 21:59.674
Your mom is insanely nice.

22:01.920 --> 22:03.195
Your house is warm.

22:03.360 --> 22:04.919
It smells good.

22:05.080 --> 22:06.753
And it's full of...

22:09.440 --> 22:10.430
I don't know what.

22:11.440 --> 22:12.874
But it's amazing.

22:17.440 --> 22:19.750
It's far from amazing.

22:20.960 --> 22:24.271
My mom's upstairs in her room
preparing for yet another...

22:24.440 --> 22:27.990
parent-teacher conference
for her delinquent daughter.

22:34.840 --> 22:36.069
Oh, no. Not now.

22:36.240 --> 22:37.071
Come here.

22:40.240 --> 22:42.197
- Veronica's your neighbor?
- Yes.

22:42.360 --> 22:44.113
Come here, please.

22:44.280 --> 22:46.272
So you're embarrassed
to be seen with me?

22:48.080 --> 22:49.275
Yeah, right.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.195
Other way around.

22:51.360 --> 22:53.079
She's gonna tell everybody
that you were here with me.

22:53.600 --> 22:55.717
And I'm just trying
to protect your reputation...

22:55.880 --> 22:57.837
so can you come here?

22:58.000 --> 23:00.356
She already saw us,
besides...

23:00.560 --> 23:02.199
there's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

23:04.080 --> 23:05.719
You say that now...

23:05.880 --> 23:08.554
but you don't know
what it's like

23:08.640 --> 23:10.518
having every move
you make...

23:10.680 --> 23:12.990
mocked and ridiculed.

23:14.400 --> 23:16.312
You'd be surprised.

23:17.640 --> 23:18.994
Come on, Calvin.

23:19.160 --> 23:20.230
Everybody likes you.

23:20.640 --> 23:22.677
Even the teachers.

23:24.200 --> 23:25.953
You do everything perfectly.

23:26.040 --> 23:28.350
Tell that to my dad.

23:29.520 --> 23:31.716
At least you have your dad.

23:32.640 --> 23:34.711
Right. Sorry, that...

23:35.800 --> 23:37.951
You must really miss him.

23:40.320 --> 23:42.835
More than anything
in the universe.

23:43.600 --> 23:45.512
Then how about
we go and find him?

23:49.240 --> 23:50.913
I've never understood
the point of fences.

23:51.080 --> 23:52.753
Wait.
What are you doing here?

23:56.400 --> 23:59.393
This is it, kids!
This is it!

24:00.280 --> 24:02.476
No! Hey, no! You're supposed
to be upstairs!

24:05.000 --> 24:06.992
"You need to get up,
get out, and get something.

24:07.160 --> 24:09.231
"How will you make it
if you never even try?"

24:09.400 --> 24:10.390
I know that one.

24:11.200 --> 24:13.078
Outkast, American.

24:14.040 --> 24:15.269
How's it going, Mrs. Who?

24:15.440 --> 24:18.114
I did it, Mrs. Who.
I got them ready.

24:18.280 --> 24:21.557
And not a moment
too soon, my little warrior.

24:21.720 --> 24:23.200
- What was that?
- Who said that?

24:23.360 --> 24:24.510
Not Who.

24:24.680 --> 24:26.831
Which. Mrs. Which.

24:27.040 --> 24:29.111
She's the final piece
of the puzzle.

24:41.040 --> 24:42.520
Come on, Mrs. Which,
show yourself.

24:45.240 --> 24:46.515
How's this?

24:48.120 --> 24:49.679
Is this good?

24:53.000 --> 24:55.071
Great. Perfect.

24:55.720 --> 24:56.790
Wonderful!

24:56.960 --> 24:59.031
You're the wrong size,
Mrs. Which.

24:59.200 --> 25:02.034
Is there such thing
as the wrong size?

25:02.200 --> 25:03.520
No, no. Never.

25:03.680 --> 25:05.353
And... And might I say
how honored I am

25:05.480 --> 25:07.756
to be on this,
my very first mission.

25:08.240 --> 25:10.072
I was chosen
for my great verbalizing

25:10.160 --> 25:11.640
and materializing skills.

25:13.040 --> 25:15.111
What are you?

25:15.320 --> 25:17.994
I am a part of the universe.

25:18.200 --> 25:19.270
Just like you, Meg.

25:20.440 --> 25:21.954
What... What do you
want with us?

25:22.160 --> 25:24.391
I don't know
about her, Charles Wallace.

25:24.560 --> 25:27.997
But I have a very good vibe
from this Calvin kid.

25:28.880 --> 25:30.951
Let's focus, shall we?

25:32.360 --> 25:35.910
We heard a call,
out in the universe.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.150
A human call.

25:37.920 --> 25:39.354
A desperate one.

25:40.040 --> 25:41.952
We couldn't tell
where it was coming from...

25:42.120 --> 25:45.591
so we followed it here,
to its destination.

25:48.520 --> 25:52.196
It brought them here, Meg.
To our house.

25:54.480 --> 25:56.437
The call
must have been Daddy's.

26:00.520 --> 26:02.432
My father's alive?

26:04.280 --> 26:05.270
We believe he is.

26:06.120 --> 26:08.510
Your father has done
an extraordinary thing.

26:08.680 --> 26:12.640
No human has ever traveled
so far out in the universe.

26:13.200 --> 26:14.839
But he may be in danger.

26:15.920 --> 26:18.310
And we're here
to help you find him.

26:20.840 --> 26:23.071
Why would you
wanna do that?

26:24.120 --> 26:25.440
Because that's what we do.

26:26.280 --> 26:27.396
We're warriors who serve

26:27.520 --> 26:29.637
the good and light
in the universe.

26:29.800 --> 26:32.759
Sometimes we rescue,
sometimes we guide.

26:32.920 --> 26:34.479
Think of us as big-hearted.

26:34.640 --> 26:35.630
Indeed.

26:36.080 --> 26:39.596
Listen, Meg. We must find him
as soon as we can.

26:41.560 --> 26:43.472
Are you up for it?

26:49.840 --> 26:51.399
I bet she says no.

26:51.560 --> 26:52.596
What?

26:52.680 --> 26:53.750
Hmm?

26:54.040 --> 26:54.996
No.

26:55.080 --> 26:55.991
Hmm. No.

26:56.160 --> 26:58.470
No, yes. No. Yes, I'm going.

26:59.560 --> 27:00.835
Of course, I am.

27:01.640 --> 27:03.074
And we know I'm up for it.

27:03.240 --> 27:05.118
And Calvin already said
he'd come.

27:05.720 --> 27:06.836
I did?

27:07.760 --> 27:08.671
I did.

27:08.840 --> 27:09.910
Then let's go!

27:10.360 --> 27:12.192
Mom. Wait.
We gotta get Mom.

27:12.400 --> 27:14.596
We'll get
your mother later. I promise.

27:14.760 --> 27:16.080
Don't worry, Meg.

27:16.280 --> 27:19.591
Tessering is almost nearly
perfectly natural.

27:20.360 --> 27:21.350
Tessering?

27:21.520 --> 27:22.590
"Almost"?

27:25.280 --> 27:26.270
What's happening?

27:26.760 --> 27:30.037
Wait. No, no. Charles Wallace,
don't go over there.

27:30.200 --> 27:31.839
No time to waste, Meg.

27:32.200 --> 27:33.953
Come on, Mrs. Whatsit!

27:40.520 --> 27:43.797
You just have
to find the right frequency...

27:44.200 --> 27:45.998
and have faith in who you are.

28:03.200 --> 28:05.351
Let's find your father.

28:06.360 --> 28:07.714
Shall we?

28:11.280 --> 28:12.600
Tessering.

28:14.400 --> 28:15.390
Tessering.

28:38.680 --> 28:40.353
Is this really happening?

28:40.880 --> 28:43.918
We did it, Meg. We actually,
really, very much so tessered!

28:45.480 --> 28:48.120
Why does my whole body hurt?

28:48.280 --> 28:50.158
We were in your backyard
and now...

28:53.680 --> 28:54.909
It's real.

28:55.080 --> 28:56.912
Let's make sure
she's all right.

28:57.480 --> 28:58.880
Ow!

28:59.240 --> 29:00.230
Yes, she's fine.

29:00.400 --> 29:03.154
Whatsit, we don't kick people.

29:03.240 --> 29:05.072
Oh, I didn't know.

29:08.320 --> 29:12.030
"The foot feels the foot
when it feels the ground."

29:12.200 --> 29:14.237
Buddha, Nepali.

29:37.720 --> 29:39.393
New word for the day.

29:40.640 --> 29:41.790
Luminous.

29:42.680 --> 29:47.277
This is my favorite planet
in the entire galaxy.

29:47.440 --> 29:48.954
They call it Uriel.

29:49.120 --> 29:51.680
We think your father
tessered here.

29:51.840 --> 29:53.194
Don't be shy.

29:53.360 --> 29:54.476
Go ahead, look around.

29:54.640 --> 29:55.790
Yes!

30:14.160 --> 30:15.992
Come on, Meg.

30:17.360 --> 30:19.272
Go ahead.

30:38.640 --> 30:39.756
Whoa.

30:40.240 --> 30:41.469
You should talk to them.

30:42.480 --> 30:45.154
Everyone knows that flowers
are the best gossipers

30:45.280 --> 30:46.839
in the entire universe.

30:47.600 --> 30:49.239
You should show them
a picture of your father

30:49.320 --> 30:51.551
and ask them
if they've seen him.

30:51.720 --> 30:54.599
How are we gonna
understand each other?

30:58.040 --> 30:59.838
At least try.

31:01.760 --> 31:04.798
Seriously, Charles Wallace,
I'm underwhelmed.

31:04.960 --> 31:06.758
Keep the faith, Mrs. Whatsit.

31:06.920 --> 31:08.115
See, I told you
this was too hard for her.

31:08.280 --> 31:10.351
I don't know why we brought
her in the first place.

31:10.520 --> 31:13.354
Whatsit, she can hear you.

31:15.080 --> 31:16.355
Oh.

31:16.720 --> 31:17.710
Oh, man.

31:17.880 --> 31:20.679
Let's just concentrate
on finding her father.

31:38.080 --> 31:40.879
This is our father.

31:43.560 --> 31:46.678
Can you help us find him,
please?

31:47.720 --> 31:48.870
Please.

31:57.760 --> 31:59.638
I can't tell
what they're saying.

32:01.320 --> 32:02.436
I can.

32:02.600 --> 32:04.114
They speak color.

32:04.880 --> 32:06.360
Oh, he did?

32:06.920 --> 32:09.071
Really?

32:09.720 --> 32:12.235
Oh. You don't say.

32:14.160 --> 32:17.551
Yep! He was here!
They saw him tesser here.

32:17.720 --> 32:21.077
But he continued to explore,
they say.

32:21.240 --> 32:22.674
Somewhere in that direction.

32:22.840 --> 32:23.671
Let's go!

32:23.840 --> 32:24.956
I'll get changed.

32:25.640 --> 32:26.676
Changed?

32:26.880 --> 32:28.792
Do you, uh,
need some privacy?

32:28.960 --> 32:30.440
No, this is fine.

32:44.280 --> 32:47.239
Whoa, Mrs. Whatsit,
humans don't just get naked.

32:48.480 --> 32:51.154
Patience, sir.
I'm not finished yet.

33:19.600 --> 33:21.239
"Dang."

33:21.400 --> 33:22.800
Tucker, American.

33:35.120 --> 33:36.600
Whoa.

33:56.480 --> 33:57.470
No!

34:03.280 --> 34:04.191
Wow!

34:55.800 --> 34:58.713
This is wild!

34:58.800 --> 34:59.836
Whoo!

35:04.080 --> 35:05.878
One, two, three.

35:06.480 --> 35:08.392
Whoa!

35:08.560 --> 35:10.074
I'm flying!

35:19.760 --> 35:21.797
Put your arms out!

35:23.320 --> 35:26.233
How are we actually
flying right now?

35:26.400 --> 35:27.629
Well, it's a phenomenon

35:27.720 --> 35:30.633
associated with
continuum fluid mechanics.

35:30.800 --> 35:33.360
It's called lift!

35:43.560 --> 35:44.880
What is that?

35:50.440 --> 35:51.430
Whoa!

35:56.000 --> 35:57.639
Calvin!

36:06.920 --> 36:08.070
My friends of light,

36:08.160 --> 36:09.913
please assist
our young friend.

36:59.360 --> 37:00.157
I'm all right.

37:02.080 --> 37:03.355
- Calvin!
- I'm sorry.

37:05.680 --> 37:06.511
I'm okay.

37:08.600 --> 37:10.239
Whatsit,
those from Earth

37:10.320 --> 37:11.470
need more help than most.

37:11.640 --> 37:12.630
You know this...

37:14.080 --> 37:15.753
You could have
prepared them better.

37:15.960 --> 37:18.156
We must help them
stay focused on light

37:18.240 --> 37:19.435
when darkness is present.

37:19.600 --> 37:21.273
I mean, I'm trying.

37:21.440 --> 37:24.433
But they're human.
They're very limited.

37:25.160 --> 37:26.310
Well, tell me you at least

37:26.400 --> 37:27.675
found something up there.

37:28.240 --> 37:29.720
Unfortunately, no.

37:29.880 --> 37:31.314
Their father's moved on.

37:31.480 --> 37:33.790
And that thing got in our way.

37:33.960 --> 37:35.838
It's spreading fast,
Mrs. Which.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.753
What is that thing?

37:39.560 --> 37:41.791
It's called Camazotz.

37:43.480 --> 37:46.473
Home to a purely evil energy.

37:47.080 --> 37:51.120
Known simply as The IT.

37:51.560 --> 37:52.755
Evil?

37:54.840 --> 37:57.560
But, like, what kind of evil?

37:57.720 --> 37:58.756
How many kinds of evil

37:58.880 --> 37:59.870
- do you need?
- Whatsit.

38:01.640 --> 38:02.710
Okay.

38:03.360 --> 38:05.158
An evil
that's actively spreading

38:05.240 --> 38:06.435
throughout the universe.

38:07.440 --> 38:08.715
So, as we continue on...

38:08.880 --> 38:11.475
we must avoid it
at all costs...

38:11.680 --> 38:13.797
and focus
on finding your father.

38:14.440 --> 38:16.796
But we don't know
where he's gone.

38:17.600 --> 38:18.954
What do we do?

38:19.120 --> 38:22.591
"Love looks not with the eyes
but with the mind."

38:23.480 --> 38:25.153
Shakespeare, British.

38:25.880 --> 38:27.997
Oh, yes, a seer!

38:28.200 --> 38:29.793
We should go visit
one of the seers.

38:29.960 --> 38:31.474
They'll narrow
the search for us.

38:31.640 --> 38:32.869
What's a seer?

38:33.080 --> 38:34.400
A moderate visionary.

38:34.560 --> 38:37.394
An occasional motivator
of insight. Hit or miss.

38:37.560 --> 38:39.040
But I know a very cute one.

38:39.200 --> 38:40.600
I mean a good one.

38:42.600 --> 38:44.592
That sounds sort of promising.

38:45.840 --> 38:48.435
Misses, grab a child.

38:48.920 --> 38:50.957
Our journey continues.

39:29.720 --> 39:31.598
She's intact.

39:31.800 --> 39:33.029
She's fine.

39:33.200 --> 39:36.750
Fine?
After that beautiful tesser?

39:36.920 --> 39:38.070
She should be glorious.

39:38.240 --> 39:39.640
Everyone else is glorious.

39:39.800 --> 39:41.519
She makes absolutely no sense.

39:42.400 --> 39:44.756
I absolutely do not understand
that girl whatsoever.

39:44.920 --> 39:46.354
Okay, it's over here.

39:46.520 --> 39:48.159
Wait till you see it.
It's so cool.

39:48.360 --> 39:49.760
The seer lives here?

39:53.160 --> 39:56.471
Wow. You're our size.

39:56.640 --> 39:57.630
The three of you...

39:58.800 --> 40:00.598
are beautiful.

40:01.320 --> 40:02.674
Thank you.

40:02.840 --> 40:04.433
And so are you.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.354
Where are we?

40:12.840 --> 40:14.274
Orion.

40:14.440 --> 40:17.114
Home of the Happy Medium.

40:19.360 --> 40:21.352
So this guy
is your boyfriend?

40:21.560 --> 40:22.550
Well, when you're

40:22.640 --> 40:24.711
over a billion years old,
you don't really need labels.

40:25.480 --> 40:28.120
Why do I have to be in pain?

40:28.320 --> 40:30.312
- Instead of...
- Glorious?

40:32.280 --> 40:34.590
You don't tesser well.

40:34.760 --> 40:36.274
In what way?

40:36.440 --> 40:40.434
Because I don't feel or see
anything when we tesser.

40:40.600 --> 40:43.559
And you won't
until you become...

40:43.720 --> 40:46.997
one with the universe
and yourself.

40:47.160 --> 40:48.913
As it is, it seems like...

40:49.080 --> 40:52.357
you don't even want
to return as yourself.

40:52.880 --> 40:54.075
Oh...

40:54.440 --> 40:58.070
Is there any way
I can return as somebody else?

40:59.240 --> 41:00.913
That I might like?

41:06.880 --> 41:08.234
Do you realize...

41:10.200 --> 41:14.240
how many events and choices...

41:15.680 --> 41:19.754
that had to occur since
the birth of the universe...

41:20.680 --> 41:25.835
leading to the making
of you...

41:26.920 --> 41:31.676
just exactly the way you are?

41:38.880 --> 41:41.918
I guess I never really
thought about that.

41:44.640 --> 41:45.756
Maybe now's the time

41:45.840 --> 41:47.274
to start thinking about it.

41:49.800 --> 41:51.200
We are here!

41:51.400 --> 41:53.517
You can do it, Meg.
You just need balance.

41:53.600 --> 41:55.034
Whoa!

41:55.120 --> 41:56.349
This is awesome!

41:56.520 --> 41:58.193
No, not awesome!

41:58.360 --> 42:00.033
Yoo-hoo!
Anybody home?

42:01.800 --> 42:03.837
- Whoo-hoo!
- Nice balance, Mrs. Who.

42:07.040 --> 42:08.679
Oh, no, no, no.

42:12.280 --> 42:14.590
Finally, a little color.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.117
Whoa!

42:28.920 --> 42:29.910
Who's there?

42:31.360 --> 42:33.829
Uninvited guest
is very unsettling!

42:34.760 --> 42:36.433
I do not like visitation!

42:37.400 --> 42:38.436
Whatsit.

42:40.240 --> 42:41.913
I really need a doorbell.

42:49.760 --> 42:51.991
Whoo! Well, you obviously
don't understand

42:52.080 --> 42:53.275
the importance of balance...

42:53.440 --> 42:54.954
of moderation...

42:56.920 --> 42:58.400
of the Happy Medium.

42:58.760 --> 43:00.433
You sound like my mother.

43:00.800 --> 43:02.519
Is your mother a baritone?

43:04.040 --> 43:05.394
How's it going, Happy?

43:05.600 --> 43:07.239
Everything's fine, Whatsit.
You look nice.

43:07.400 --> 43:09.312
- I do?
- I like your outfit.

43:10.040 --> 43:11.918
It's like a person outfit.

43:12.080 --> 43:13.673
Oh, thank you.

43:13.840 --> 43:15.479
You look like a person.

43:17.640 --> 43:21.156
Thank you. You look
pretty okay as well.

43:21.720 --> 43:23.234
Thank you. Earth tones.

43:23.720 --> 43:25.234
We need your insight.

43:26.040 --> 43:28.760
We are looking for a man...

43:28.960 --> 43:32.351
who's lost in the universe.

43:32.960 --> 43:34.235
My father.

43:36.720 --> 43:38.234
Dr. Murry.

43:41.000 --> 43:42.229
Handsome fellow.

43:47.280 --> 43:49.192
How am I supposed
to say no?

43:52.480 --> 43:53.755
Okay.

43:56.960 --> 43:58.189
Center yourself.

43:58.760 --> 44:00.638
One foot up, please.

44:01.240 --> 44:02.037
Okay.

44:02.880 --> 44:05.475
Now, very little is up to <i>moi.</i>

44:06.080 --> 44:09.517
All right? Your energies
will affect what we see.

44:09.680 --> 44:13.071
So, core in, spine long...

44:13.360 --> 44:15.636
...shoulders down...

44:17.280 --> 44:18.270
buttocks taut.

44:20.600 --> 44:22.751
Close your eyes.

44:23.160 --> 44:24.196
You're kidding.

44:25.120 --> 44:26.634
Do I look like I'm kidding?

44:26.800 --> 44:27.870
Very much so.

44:28.720 --> 44:30.473
- A little.
- I'm not.

44:32.720 --> 44:34.279
I'm not.

44:34.600 --> 44:36.592
Let's try this again.
Now...

44:37.720 --> 44:39.359
relax the face...

44:40.440 --> 44:42.477
close your eyes...

44:42.640 --> 44:44.711
and open your memories.

44:45.320 --> 44:47.232
Think about your father.

44:51.120 --> 44:51.792
No!

44:52.000 --> 44:54.151
I can't, I can't.
I'm sorry, I can't.

44:58.120 --> 44:59.395
I'm sorry, but...

44:59.560 --> 45:02.598
I really just... I really
don't understand...

45:02.800 --> 45:06.271
how thinking about him
is going to help us find him.

45:06.800 --> 45:09.110
All I do is think about him.

45:10.280 --> 45:11.509
I'm sorry, Mrs. Which,

45:11.600 --> 45:13.717
but I think we need
to show her something.

45:13.880 --> 45:16.315
She needs to understand
what's possible.

45:17.120 --> 45:19.680
She needs to know
what's at stake.

45:21.960 --> 45:24.873
Close your eyes.
See with mine.

45:28.440 --> 45:29.430
This time...

45:30.800 --> 45:32.075
don't look away.

45:44.640 --> 45:46.791
<i>The IT's home
may be Camazotz...</i>

45:46.960 --> 45:49.111
<i>but through darkness,</i>

45:49.200 --> 45:52.238
<i>The IT's reach
spreads far beyond.</i>

45:52.760 --> 45:54.717
<i>Even to your own planet.</i>

45:58.000 --> 46:00.037
<i>The only thing
in the universe...</i>

46:00.200 --> 46:03.796
<i>that travels
faster than light...</i>

46:03.960 --> 46:04.950
<i>is the darkness.</i>

46:06.680 --> 46:09.240
<i>The IT invades
the place inside of us</i>

46:09.320 --> 46:11.277
<i>where hope and joy lives...</i>

46:11.440 --> 46:12.760
We're happy to announce
the promotion

46:12.840 --> 46:14.638
of one of our current
faculty members...

46:15.280 --> 46:16.839
to be our new principal.

46:17.040 --> 46:18.520
That faculty member

46:18.600 --> 46:21.160
is three-time science teacher
of the year...

46:21.320 --> 46:22.549
James Jenkins.

46:22.720 --> 46:25.155
Come on up, Principal Jenkins.

46:27.480 --> 46:29.756
...<i>replaces it
with jealousy...</i>

46:40.280 --> 46:41.680
<i>and judgment...</i>

46:44.480 --> 46:45.800
<i>pain...</i>

46:48.720 --> 46:50.234
<i>and despair.</i>

46:50.400 --> 46:51.914
What's up, Pops?

46:52.120 --> 46:53.110
How you doing tonight?

46:53.280 --> 46:54.680
Hey, man, don't do that.

46:55.440 --> 46:57.955
- What you got up in here?
- What are you doing, man?

46:58.120 --> 47:00.112
Man, do you know how I work
for this stuff?

47:00.280 --> 47:01.760
Hey, man.

47:05.320 --> 47:06.549
84...

47:06.760 --> 47:08.035
82...

47:08.200 --> 47:09.475
82?

47:09.680 --> 47:12.673
I mean, are you even trying
or are you just an idiot?

47:12.840 --> 47:15.435
Because if this is the best
you can do, it's pathetic!

47:15.640 --> 47:17.757
You look at me
when I'm talking to you!

47:17.920 --> 47:19.559
This is pathetic!

47:23.920 --> 47:26.435
You see?
This is what The IT does.

47:28.600 --> 47:32.913
One person at a time...

47:33.960 --> 47:36.236
until fear takes over.

47:36.400 --> 47:38.392
Fear turns to rage.

47:40.720 --> 47:43.758
And rage leads to violence.

47:46.400 --> 47:48.392
And then
there's a tipping point.

47:49.880 --> 47:51.439
If we do not act soon...

47:52.000 --> 47:55.152
darkness will fall
across the universe.

47:56.080 --> 47:57.594
We...

47:57.760 --> 48:02.835
we're in search of warriors
who can fight The IT...

48:04.120 --> 48:08.160
and who can bring hope back.

48:10.160 --> 48:11.594
Your father.

48:14.640 --> 48:15.869
My father?

48:25.360 --> 48:27.511
Be a warrior.

48:27.680 --> 48:29.000
Can you?

48:32.800 --> 48:34.632
I'll try.

48:35.680 --> 48:38.639
Your father sounds
like a good man.

48:39.800 --> 48:41.029
How about we find him?

48:42.560 --> 48:44.279
Good. Okay.

48:46.400 --> 48:47.470
Good, good, good.

48:47.640 --> 48:48.835
- Yeah.
- Okay.

48:49.440 --> 48:50.590
Now, we're grounded.
We're centered, right?

48:50.760 --> 48:52.433
- Okay, yeah.
- Okay.

48:52.880 --> 48:55.520
You can do this. Okay?

48:56.280 --> 48:58.351
You're choosing not to.

49:07.440 --> 49:09.671
But what if...

49:11.160 --> 49:13.391
What if he doesn't
wanna be found?

49:16.880 --> 49:21.716
It's okay to fear
the answers, Meg.

49:23.680 --> 49:26.240
But you can't avoid them.

49:27.800 --> 49:29.473
Trust me.

49:29.640 --> 49:31.552
You don't wanna
end up like me,

49:31.640 --> 49:34.075
a weirdo with a beard
living in a cave.

49:39.680 --> 49:42.479
Your father didn't forget you.

49:45.960 --> 49:47.792
You're too precious.

49:50.880 --> 49:52.599
All right, you ready?

49:52.680 --> 49:54.399
Mmm. Yeah.

49:56.840 --> 50:00.470
Center yourself. Where is he?

50:03.760 --> 50:05.080
Okay.

50:06.040 --> 50:08.157
Now we're getting a vision.

50:11.600 --> 50:12.590
Okay.

50:26.120 --> 50:28.351
<i>Flower</i>

50:28.520 --> 50:31.831
<i>of the universe</i>

50:32.920 --> 50:35.992
<i>A child of mine</i>

50:47.960 --> 50:48.950
<i>Flower</i>

50:51.520 --> 50:54.752
<i>of the universe</i>

51:34.080 --> 51:37.391
Love.
That's the frequency.

51:43.560 --> 51:45.438
<i>That's it, Meg.</i>

51:46.120 --> 51:48.396
<i>He started in Uriel.</i>

51:48.720 --> 51:51.474
<i>Then he went to Ixchel.
Keep going, Meg.</i>

51:52.440 --> 51:54.955
<i>Oh! There's Aunt Beast!</i>

51:59.360 --> 52:03.513
<i>Oh, no,
he's going to Camazotz.</i>

52:04.200 --> 52:05.270
No!

52:05.440 --> 52:07.432
- Whoa, whoa.
- No.

52:40.400 --> 52:41.993
I'm so sorry, Meg.

52:42.160 --> 52:44.356
The IT got to him
before we could.

52:44.520 --> 52:46.398
We thought he could
join the fight,

52:46.480 --> 52:48.119
but now we need
to fight for him.

52:51.160 --> 52:54.915
So, how are we gonna
get my father off Camazotz?

52:56.440 --> 53:00.434
We can't tesser to Camazotz.

53:01.920 --> 53:05.038
We can only tesser
where we find light...

53:06.040 --> 53:08.077
for we are light.

53:08.800 --> 53:11.838
Camazotz is all darkness.

53:12.600 --> 53:16.276
This is no longer a search.
It's a rescue.

53:17.240 --> 53:20.597
We must go back to Earth...

53:21.200 --> 53:22.350
speak to your mother...

53:23.960 --> 53:25.599
regroup.

53:26.240 --> 53:30.473
No, no, no. I cannot leave
here without my father.

53:30.680 --> 53:33.479
It's for the best, Meg.
We have to make a plan.

53:33.640 --> 53:36.439
Please. Please!
I've come all this way.

53:36.600 --> 53:39.399
We're too close to finding
him to turn back!

53:39.800 --> 53:41.951
"Planning is essential."

53:42.040 --> 53:43.793
Churchill, British.

53:47.720 --> 53:50.713
No, no, no. Please!
He's running out of time.

53:50.880 --> 53:52.553
No, we cannot!

53:52.720 --> 53:53.790
<i>We have to save him.</i>

53:54.000 --> 53:56.640
<i>We can't give up.
There must be a way!</i>

53:57.160 --> 53:58.913
<i>Don't leave him!
We can't!</i>

53:59.080 --> 53:59.911
<i>Dad!</i>

54:11.560 --> 54:13.279
Where are we?

54:14.920 --> 54:16.240
Where are the Misses?

54:17.840 --> 54:19.832
This place feels weird.

54:24.680 --> 54:26.558
Look! The Misses.

54:41.840 --> 54:42.830
Thank goodness
you made it.

54:42.920 --> 54:44.070
I was so worried.

54:45.280 --> 54:46.600
Are you okay,
are you hurt at all?

54:46.760 --> 54:47.750
We're okay.

54:49.080 --> 54:52.790
Am I losing my senses or did
you just use your own words?

54:52.960 --> 54:56.670
She's weakening.
As am I and Mrs. Whatsit.

54:57.240 --> 54:59.311
Wait, what's wrong?

54:59.520 --> 55:00.954
Where... Where are we?

55:02.240 --> 55:03.674
Camazotz.

55:05.040 --> 55:08.078
Your will to find your father
took over our tesser...

55:08.520 --> 55:10.751
and re-directed it from Earth.

55:13.960 --> 55:16.634
We must leave this planet.

55:16.800 --> 55:17.790
And we do not have
the strength

55:17.880 --> 55:19.030
to take you with us.

55:19.440 --> 55:21.591
We can
barely tesser ourselves.

55:22.360 --> 55:24.716
You must continue on
without us.

55:25.600 --> 55:27.592
You must find your father.

55:29.600 --> 55:32.160
And know that
you're going to be tested

55:32.240 --> 55:34.709
every step of the way.

55:34.880 --> 55:37.679
You'll encounter things
you think you know

55:37.760 --> 55:38.989
but you don't.

55:40.240 --> 55:45.031
Here is the place
to be suspicious, okay?

55:48.800 --> 55:49.790
We're fading.

55:49.960 --> 55:53.112
Can't we at least leave them
with something to help them?

55:53.280 --> 55:55.476
Yes. Gifts.

55:55.640 --> 55:57.199
I love gifts.

56:01.400 --> 56:03.073
They work well
in a moment of peril...

56:04.840 --> 56:08.117
for they see
that which is enfolded.

56:09.040 --> 56:12.670
Not gone, just enfolded.

56:17.080 --> 56:21.120
Meg. Trouble, problematic Meg.

56:22.960 --> 56:25.714
To you I give
the gift of your faults.

56:28.040 --> 56:30.271
You're welcome.

56:30.440 --> 56:33.478
You do know my faults
are the bad qualities, right?

56:34.200 --> 56:35.998
Are they really? Hmm.

56:37.320 --> 56:39.357
Well then, you're all set.

56:39.520 --> 56:43.150
My gift is my command.

56:44.200 --> 56:46.635
Stay together.

56:47.600 --> 56:50.069
Don't let anyone separate you.

56:51.440 --> 56:54.558
This is a planet
of many faces...

56:54.760 --> 56:58.037
run by one cruel
and vicious mind.

56:58.200 --> 57:00.760
The IT desires
our strongest lights.

57:01.240 --> 57:03.072
Do not give in.

57:03.760 --> 57:05.433
We're going now.

57:05.600 --> 57:06.511
Be careful.

57:07.440 --> 57:09.432
"When shall we three
meet again?

57:09.520 --> 57:11.910
"In thunder,
lightning or in rain?"

57:12.800 --> 57:13.995
Shakespeare.

57:15.560 --> 57:19.076
Keep going.
We'll be watching.

57:30.240 --> 57:31.913
What's happening?

57:33.200 --> 57:34.714
Wait. Where's
Charles Wallace?

57:35.200 --> 57:36.236
He was just here!

57:39.760 --> 57:42.559
Charles Wallace!

57:42.720 --> 57:44.632
- Charles Wallace!
- Charles Wallace!

57:46.160 --> 57:47.435
<i>There's danger here.</i>

57:47.600 --> 57:50.035
<i>He's safe over the wall.</i>

57:50.200 --> 57:51.634
<i>Wait at the stream.</i>

57:57.880 --> 57:59.314
<i>Get to the wall.</i>

58:02.840 --> 58:05.196
What is that?

58:07.720 --> 58:08.870
<i>Get to the wall!</i>

58:09.040 --> 58:10.030
Run!

58:36.320 --> 58:38.277
It's getting closer!

58:38.440 --> 58:39.874
Go, go, go! Faster!

58:47.520 --> 58:48.954
There's the wall!

58:53.720 --> 58:55.632
We gotta get over the wall!

59:07.600 --> 59:08.590
Run faster!

59:08.760 --> 59:11.514
- Faster is not gonna help!
- Faster!

59:40.240 --> 59:41.230
Calvin!

59:41.960 --> 59:43.394
Look, look!

59:44.160 --> 59:46.516
See what it's doing?

59:49.200 --> 59:52.034
It's picking up stuff
and throwing it over!

59:56.960 --> 01:00:00.590
Range is at fifty,
I don't know. Velocity...

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:02.353
We won't make it that way!

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:05.156
No, Meg!
We have to keep going!

01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:06.913
This is the only way!

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:13.671
Do you trust me?

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:15.754
I trust you!

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:18.640
Okay.

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:30.991
Run, Calvin, run!

01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:32.714
How did you do
that whole thing with the log?

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:36.635
It's just a physics thing.

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:37.677
The classic

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:40.320
slingshot maneuver.

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:43.757
Just a physics thing?

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:48.239
You have no idea
how incredible you are...

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:51.200
do you?

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:01.480
You're the one
who came with me.

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:06.509
You didn't
have to do that.

01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:10.234
You're the one who
doesn't have to be here...

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:12.871
but you are.

01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:16.239
You're the one who's...

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:29.476
I like your hair.

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:35.512
Thank you.

01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:38.835
Meg! Calvin!

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.437
You made it!
I couldn't see you!

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:46.238
I couldn't tell!

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:50.191
I saw houses down there.
Come on!

01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:57.594
Is Daddy down here?

01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:01.113
I hope so.

01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:21.437
I smell food.

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:23.598
Like good, roasted food.

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:28.831
Who else is starving?

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:09.313
I can't stand the sound.

01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:17.392
The rhythm. It hurts.

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:20.031
Come here.

01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:22.240
Cover your ears.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.435
Darling, time for dinner!

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:03.998
Are you lost, children?

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:09.680
I bet you're hungry,
and in need of comfort.

01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:14.394
I have roasts...

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:17.632
and potatoes,
and cakes of all sorts.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.229
I could eat.

01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:20.830
Um...

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:22.795
Uh...

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:23.996
No.

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:25.960
Thanks. We're good.

01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:33.514
- No.
- Cakes of all sorts!

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:34.670
No!

01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:36.911
Trust no one, remember?

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:46.636
It's changing again.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.992
Is this still Camazotz?

01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:57.510
They said it was
a planet of many faces.

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:33.438
Do you think this person would
mind if I ate all their food?

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:34.795
Probably.

01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:38.832
Hey! I'm right here!

01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:41.798
I'm right here!

01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:44.634
Hello!

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:48.631
Hello! Friends!

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:52.120
Hello, friends. Hey.

01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:53.879
How are you guys?

01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:55.269
Who are you?

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:56.999
Oh, me? I'm nobody.

01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:00.989
But you can call me Red.
And you are...?

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:05.160
Oh, I'm Calvin. This is Meg.
And this is Charles Wallace.

01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:06.356
Oh!

01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:08.637
You're Alex Murry's kids,
aren't you?

01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:13.635
You know my father?

01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:15.274
Yeah, yeah! I totally
know your father.

01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:17.079
He's a great guy. I just
saw him a couple minutes ago.

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:19.070
Where?

01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:20.515
I mean, we've been
looking for him.

01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:21.756
Can you take us to him?

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:23.274
Yeah. Yeah.
Well, no, no, no.

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:25.318
Yeah. Almost. He should be
done working pretty soon.

01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:28.958
He's kind of a busy guy.
You know, bit of a workaholic.

01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:30.600
But I don't have
to tell you that. Right?

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:33.718
You know what?
Guys, sit down. Sit down.

01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:34.996
Relax.
There's nothing to do here.

01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:36.070
Nothing to worry about.

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:38.559
Are you guys hungry?

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:41.752
Everything's taken care of.

01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:45.231
In total. Without options
or alternatives.

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:47.310
Hmm.

01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:51.359
You guys hungry?

01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:53.398
Well, I'll brave it for us.

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:06.353
What's wrong, little guy?

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:07.676
It tastes like...

01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:10.594
like sand.

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:12.234
Does it?

01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:14.359
I don't taste any sand.

01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:16.515
Try mine.

01:08:22.279 --> 01:08:24.192
It's all sand!

01:08:24.479 --> 01:08:25.630
Ha!

01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:29.029
I thought you were like me,
Charles Wallace.

01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:31.756
I thought you were special.

01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:33.279
And you are.

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:35.439
You passed the test.

01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:38.439
It's as simple as that.

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:42.276
Simple as twice one is two.
Twice two is four.

01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:44.000
Twice three is six.

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:46.679
Twice four is eight.

01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:48.638
Twice five is 10.

01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:50.553
Twice six is 12.

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:52.073
Twice seven is 14.

01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:53.356
What are you doing?

01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:54.913
Twice eight is 16.

01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:57.390
Uh, we'd
like to see our father now.

01:08:57.560 --> 01:08:59.791
You got it.
I'll take you right to him.

01:09:01.319 --> 01:09:04.073
Charles Wallace.
Take my hand now.

01:09:04.279 --> 01:09:05.475
Please.

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:08.073
No, thanks.

01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:13.910
Oh, and, Meg...

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:15.596
Hey.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.639
Thanks for everything.

01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:21.796
You brought him right to us.

01:09:28.279 --> 01:09:29.430
No! Stop!

01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:32.149
My little brother!

01:09:32.319 --> 01:09:33.470
- Charles Wallace!
- Please!

01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:36.033
Charles Wallace!

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:39.029
Charles Wallace!

01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:40.270
Move!

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:42.751
Charles Wallace!

01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:56.994
Well, that was fun.

01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:59.436
Welcome to Central
Central Intelligence.

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:05.029
Get away from him!

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:09.350
Relax. Don't fight it.

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:11.352
It'll make it much easier,
I promise.

01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:14.871
Please, Charles Wallace.
Please. He is dangerous.

01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:16.030
What has he done to you?

01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:17.156
Shut up, Meg!

01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:18.390
Yeah. Shut up, Meg.

01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:22.152
Sorry, Red.
Meg's always been a problem.

01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:23.919
She's quite an aberration,
you know.

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:25.400
Yeah, I can tell.

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:28.912
But aberrations
are far more interesting.

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:31.077
Don't you think,
Charles Wallace?

01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:34.920
That's so like you to try
to come to the rescue,

01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:36.030
isn't it, Calvin?

01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:40.319
Always so helpful.
Overly cheery.

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:41.595
Trying to please everyone.

01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:43.673
Hoping to convince them...

01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:47.032
that you're not just a burden
to your father and your world.

01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:48.429
Pathetic.

01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:55.752
That's not why I do it.

01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:57.434
Of course, it is!

01:10:57.600 --> 01:10:59.557
Why else would you come
on this ridiculous

01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:01.552
journey with people
you barely know?

01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:03.757
Now that's enough,
Charles Wallace!

01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:04.830
You need to stop!

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.469
It's enough when The IT
says it's enough!

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.276
Sit. I can take it from here.

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:13.352
No doubt about that,
little guy.

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:22.315
Would you like to meet The IT?
That happy sadist.

01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:24.434
Not especially.

01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:26.876
Watch your tone!

01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:29.280
I'm sorry.

01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:33.471
We're just here to see Dad.
Remember?

01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:35.194
Your dad.

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:37.875
Flower of the universe.
Child of mine.

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:40.070
No.

01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:42.391
I think you mean your dad...

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.593
who left you...

01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:48.037
who'd rather be anywhere else
in the universe than with you.

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:50.758
Why would you even
want to see him?

01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:54.870
Oh, well.

01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:57.193
I wish I could
take you to him.

01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:59.320
But I can't.

01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:01.310
He's gone.

01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:02.994
He's not gone.

01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:06.231
You're right.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.994
He's not gone.
And yet, I don't see him.

01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:14.357
He's...
He's not gone.

01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:25.433
He's not gone.

01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:30.553
Just enfolded.

01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:37.833
What is it?

01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:43.633
What do you see?

01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:48.238
Topological order.

01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:51.549
Um, fractal dimension.

01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:53.791
Ooh. Clever.

01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:55.280
That she is.

01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:06.630
Oh.

01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:11.351
<i>They come to see
the fire burning</i>

01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:15.040
<i>In your heart</i>

01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:20.639
<i>They want to witness</i>

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:29.517
<i>This love from the start</i>

01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:40.634
<i>They hear you
when you cry</i>

01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:47.555
<i>This love is far and wide</i>

01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:54.231
<i>When you smile,
the stars align</i>

01:13:56.480 --> 01:14:02.238
<i>Flower of the universe</i>

01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:06.191
<i>Child of mine</i>

01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:10.115
<i>Ooh</i>

01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:55.996
Meg.

01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:01.837
- Meg.
- Dad, it's...

01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:08.114
- Dad.
- Meg.

01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:21.590
Dad.

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:24.874
Dad.

01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:31.875
Dad.

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:36.911
Is this a trick? A dream?

01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:39.750
It's me, Dad. It's me.

01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:44.038
I missed you so much.

01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:46.717
My beautiful Meg.

01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:49.714
I missed you
every second of every day.

01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:54.159
Let me look at you.

01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:57.600
Daddy.

01:15:58.120 --> 01:15:59.440
Hi, Dad.

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:09.589
How long
have I been gone, baby?

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:15.799
How long have I been gone?

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:23.514
Four years.

01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:27.871
You left four years ago.

01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:30.670
No.

01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:35.117
No. No. No.

01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:37.511
No, that can't be. No.

01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:39.919
No. I didn't.

01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:43.314
No, I didn't leave you, baby.
I wouldn't.

01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:45.517
I would never leave you,
sweetheart.

01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:48.880
I've been trapped here.

01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:50.680
How did you get here?

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:51.956
It's dangerous here, Meglet.

01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:53.713
You can't be here.
How did you get here?

01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:56.480
You called out for us.
We came for you.

01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:00.477
We're here
to bring you home, Dad.

01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:04.190
"We"?

01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:06.079
My friend Calvin and...

01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:08.837
Charles Wallace came with me.

01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:15.077
Charles Wallace.
My baby boy is here?

01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:16.230
Where is he?

01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:17.760
Is he okay?

01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:23.476
The IT has done
something to him.

01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:37.239
Charles Wallace.

01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:40.394
Is that you, son?

01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:41.471
Son?

01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:43.599
Depends on who you ask.

01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:47.920
Let me get a good look at you.

01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:53.190
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:55.749
Charles Wallace.

01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:57.673
You don't look like
how I pictured you.

01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:00.234
I'm underwhelmed.

01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:02.352
Charles Wallace.

01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:05.110
Hey.

01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:07.633
What has The IT done to you?

01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:10.391
The IT has shown me
my potential.

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:14.069
I can see the weaknesses
of any soul.

01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:15.833
Like, take your soul.

01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:19.158
So desperate
to matter in the universe...

01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:23.953
you'd abandon your own family
and never look back.

01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:32.512
That's not true, I swear.

01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:34.550
Doesn't matter.

01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:37.160
Let's go meet The IT.

01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:40.633
- No. No.
- Yes, yes.

01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:42.591
Come on, now.

01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:44.592
Don't make me drag you.

01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:49.677
Okay. How about
you just take me?

01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:50.671
No.

01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:52.832
- Meg. Meg. Take me.
- Dad, no. No!

01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:53.712
No.

01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:55.439
I have
to do this, sweetheart.

01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:56.750
We don't want you!

01:18:56.840 --> 01:18:58.115
We've already had you!

01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:10.076
Stop it!

01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:12.191
Grab onto it!

01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:15.436
Let us go!

01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:19.998
Stop clawing the walls.
The IT's waiting for you.

01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:21.230
You're hurting them!

01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:22.635
And you're just
being impolite!

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:23.990
Stop!

01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:26.470
Stop! Please!

01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:29.156
Don't do this, please!

01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:32.872
Please, don't do this!

01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:35.675
This is all your fault,
Mr. Murry!

01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:38.520
Can you
hear me? Meg!

01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:39.830
Meg!

01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:41.076
Meg, wake up, baby!

01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:42.230
Resist. Resist, Meg.

01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:44.517
Don't give in to the darkness.
Don't give in! Meglet...

01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:45.875
Meglet, wake up.

01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:47.599
Wake up! Wake up! Meg!

01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:48.790
Meg! Wake up!

01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:50.710
Come on. Hold on.

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:52.439
Hold on, come on. Hold on!

01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:53.596
Breathe.

01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:55.240
Breathe, Meg, breathe!

01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:57.119
Let her go. Let her give in.

01:19:57.280 --> 01:19:58.760
Give up.

01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:02.755
This is what you get when you
put yourself before family!

01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:07.959
Please. Charles Wallace,
I'll do anything you want.

01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:12.319
Charles Wallace
isn't here right now.

01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:15.439
And even if he were...

01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:18.596
you're powerless against us.

01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:21.229
You have nothing that we want.

01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:24.275
Except for her.

01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:25.271
No.

01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:33.873
Forgive me.

01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:39.280
Meg! Meg, wake up. Wake up!

01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:43.075
Come on. Here.

01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:46.072
You brought light
back to me, Meglet.

01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:47.356
Maybe I can tesser again.

01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:50.800
Hold on.
Hold on, stay with me.

01:20:57.920 --> 01:20:59.513
It's working!

01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:01.430
It's working.

01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:03.595
Meg.

01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:05.877
Meg. Meg, baby. Meg.

01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:09.510
We're going back home.
We're going back home.

01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:11.630
Just a little longer.

01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:13.160
Charles Wallace.

01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:15.913
Just breathe. Just breathe.

01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:20.438
The darkness has him.
We can't take him with us.

01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:24.997
If we don't leave now,
we'll be trapped here forever.

01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:27.997
How could you? How...

01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:30.993
Meg, we have to.
The IT is gonna destroy us.

01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:32.913
- It's gonna destroy you, Meg.
- How could you leave him?

01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:35.072
I'm gonna come back
for him, Meg.

01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:36.919
How could you leave him again?

01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:38.190
I have to. I have to.

01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:40.752
I can't lose
both of my children.

01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:43.312
No, don't leave!

01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:45.836
I won't leave him!
I won't leave my brother!

01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:48.159
Stop! Stop!

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.036
Stop!

01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:52.157
I won't tesser without him!

01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:53.959
Stop!

01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:57.871
Charles Wallace, I'm coming.

01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:28.350
Welcome.

01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:34.157
You made the right decision
to join us.

01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:37.317
Don't you feel better?

01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:40.391
You look better.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.516
I've known you
for a long time.

01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:47.669
It's good
to finally have you here.

01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:52.240
Charles Wallace.

01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:54.919
Charles Wallace.

01:22:58.280 --> 01:22:59.919
Charles Wallace!

01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:06.194
Hi, Meg.

01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:09.554
We knew you'd be back.

01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:11.634
We gotta say...

01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:14.753
nothing we love more
than stupid courage.

01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:16.830
"We"?

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:20.198
Oh.
Where are my manners?

01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:24.270
Meg, meet The IT!

01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:29.910
No!

01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:46.870
Welcome to the darkest mind

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:48.275
in the universe.

01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:53.438
Extraordinary,
don't you think?

01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:56.672
That's one word for it.

01:23:57.760 --> 01:23:59.911
We could really use
a gal like you.

01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:02.392
So, what do you say?

01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:05.315
You wanna join us?

01:24:07.640 --> 01:24:08.710
No thanks.

01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:32.392
Take a good look
at her.

01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:34.472
She's a better version
of you.

01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:39.119
She's sure to be popular.
Great student.

01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:41.920
Principal Jenkins
is going to love her.

01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:45.120
And Calvin probably will, too.

01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:47.873
She doesn't just have to
live in your imagination...

01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:50.111
I can make her real.

01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:53.999
You said
you wanted to come back

01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:55.196
as someone else.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:57.992
Join us, and I can make you
just like her.

01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:01.875
She's perfect.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.037
No!

01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:15.035
You better watch yourself...

01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:17.590
or we'll do to you
what you did to her.

01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:20.235
We don't care
whose sister you are!

01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:28.314
We're your only option,

01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:30.631
and we're starting
to not want you!

01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:32.951
A feeling you're very
used to, actually.

01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:35.880
No one in school likes you.

01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:39.795
Your father left you
without so much as a goodbye.

01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:43.431
Every bad thing you think
about yourself is true.

01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:46.153
<i>"The wound is the place</i>

01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:48.311
<i>"where the light enters you."</i>

01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:49.709
<i>Be a warrior.</i>

01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:52.513
<i>Can you?</i>

01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:55.479
<i>To you I give
the gift of your faults.</i>

01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:03.591
I know my faults.

01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:07.072
How I'm messy...

01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:10.200
uncoordinated...

01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:14.116
I don't trust anyone.

01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:17.952
And most days,
I hate myself.

01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:22.313
I'm impulsive...

01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:24.800
and suspicious.

01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:27.910
And yet...

01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:31.709
you love me.

01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:34.156
- What?
- Don't you, Charles Wallace?

01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:36.359
- No!
- Shut up!

01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:40.389
It's okay.

01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:43.150
Few understand
just how weak light is.

01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:45.198
Few are willing
to accept the fact

01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:46.999
that love is just a word.

01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:49.755
It's an empty,
meaningless word.

01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:52.271
You can hurt me
when I say I love you,

01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:53.589
but I'll love you anyway!

01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:56.195
And you love me!

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.993
That's why you make milk
for me on stormy nights.

01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:05.635
That's why you check in
on me during recess.

01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:11.311
That's why you wanted to
find Daddy, to make me happy!

01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:15.436
That's why the Misses
took a chance on me.

01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:18.273
Because they felt your love.

01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:23.078
And you should love me
because I deserve to be loved!

01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:26.351
Stop it! Just, stop it!

01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:29.991
I love you! I love you,
Charles Wallace! I love you!

01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:31.310
Stop it!

01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:42.995
Please...

01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:45.152
I love you, Biscuits.

01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:48.478
No love!

01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:53.478
Only darkness!

01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:06.070
Meg!

01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:15.836
Meg.

01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:20.790
Meg.

01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:23.835
Meg, wake up.

01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:25.960
Come on, Meg.

01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:27.156
Please.

01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:31.990
<i>Flower...</i>

01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:35.550
<i>of the universe</i>

01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:54.791
<i>Child of mine</i>

01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:22.310
Whoa.

01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:34.876
The Misses.

01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:36.750
They came back.

01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:42.315
Charles Wallace,
your light has returned.

01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:44.000
Meg, you did it.

01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:46.393
I tried.

01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:49.156
Well, I knew
you could do it all along.

01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:51.872
I never doubted you
for a second.

01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:53.716
Well...

01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:56.190
I used my faults,
like you said.

01:29:56.360 --> 01:29:58.591
Such beautiful faults.

01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:00.592
I'm so proud of you, Meg.

01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:04.959
The universe is bright tonight
because of you.

01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:07.032
You weakened The IT...

01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:08.190
and you've given your Earth

01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:11.034
and everyone on it
a real chance.

01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:13.873
You should be proud.

01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:17.272
Some of our best warriors
have come from Earth.

01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:22.358
Einstein, Curie, Gandhi.

01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:24.313
Austen. Kahlo.

01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:25.317
Schindler.

01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:27.716
Nelson Mandela.
Maya Angelou.

01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:31.635
And now, Meg Murry.

01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:35.350
Me?

01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:37.993
What?

01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:43.915
All those who are willing
to face the darkness...

01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:48.478
and bring the best
of themselves to the light...

01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:50.233
for the world.

01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:56.597
This is where we leave you...

01:30:57.680 --> 01:30:59.990
to become warriors on Earth.

01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:03.032
Now, Meg, it's time...

01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:06.712
for you to start the tesser
for all of us...

01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:09.076
and make your way back home.

01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:10.830
What?

01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:13.276
Me?

01:31:15.640 --> 01:31:17.552
You want me
to start the tesser?

01:31:18.760 --> 01:31:22.117
"Tomorrow, there'll be
more of us."

01:31:22.280 --> 01:31:24.317
Miranda, American.

01:31:53.320 --> 01:31:54.674
<i>Goodbye, my loves.</i>

01:31:56.200 --> 01:31:58.795
<i>Farewell,
my little warriors.</i>

01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:02.635
<i>Until we meet again.</i>

01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:12.154
See you at home!

01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:55.840
Oh!

01:33:56.040 --> 01:33:57.474
Meg, you did it!

01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:00.030
You absolutely,
gloriously tessered.

01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:08.516
Daddy!

01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:22.189
Hey.

01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:23.760
You did it.

01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:26.679
I sure did.

01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:32.391
Mommy!

01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:39.950
Hi. Uh...

01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:43.513
Are you okay?

01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:47.075
I'm okay, Dad.

01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:48.716
Good.

01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:55.117
I'm sorry, Meg.

01:34:56.240 --> 01:34:57.310
I, uh...

01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:06.712
I wanted to shake hands
with the universe.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.231
But I should've been
holding yours.

01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:34.112
I love you so much.

01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:47.193
I love you, too.

01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:34.793
Charles Wallace?
What are you doing outside?

01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:36.030
Mommy!

01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:40.759
Well, well, okay.

01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:43.310
Thanks. What's going on?

01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:46.956
Wait.

01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:48.793
Am I asleep?

01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:50.235
Am I dreaming?

01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:54.916
No...

01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:56.759
you're not sleeping.

01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:01.476
And it's important
you know that.

01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:04.390
Why?

01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:06.713
Because Meg
brought you something.

01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:25.077
I'm sorry I'm late.

01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:30.351
I'm so, so sorry.

01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:54.839
How...

01:37:57.280 --> 01:37:59.431
- Where...
- Your calculations.

01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:02.957
They gave us the universe.

01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:12.437
I think
I'm gonna go home.

01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:14.914
You sure?

01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:17.116
Yeah.

01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:21.838
There are some things
I need to say to my dad.

01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:24.951
Maybe now I can
finally say them.

01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:30.273
It's funny
how it took a trip

01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:32.636
around the universe
to get me there.

01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:47.794

- Daddy,

01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:29.633
I have a new word for the day.
Wanna hear it?

01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:31.871
Home.

Thank you.

<i>Ooh</i>

01:43:57.720 --> 01:44:02.351
<i>They come to see
the fire burning</i>

01:44:03.400 --> 01:44:05.869

The stars align</i>

01:44:47.560 --> 01:44:53.238
<i>Flower of the universe</i>

01:44:53.680 --> 01:44:55.990
<i>Child of mine</i>

01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:12.232
<i>When you sleep</i>

01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:15.439
<i>Softly the angels come</i>

01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:19.313
<i>Like diamonds</i>

01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:22.352

the stars align</i>
