00:01.201 --> 00:03.536
GILES: Previously...
SPIKE:
 Last night changed things.

00:03.570 --> 00:06.307
The only thing that's different
is that I'm disgusted
with myself.

00:06.339 --> 00:07.740
Is this the way
to the movies?

00:07.775 --> 00:10.711
-What is this place?
-I'll just be a minute.

00:10.743 --> 00:13.547
Willow's into something.
Her and Dawn have been
missing for hours.

00:13.580 --> 00:15.782
Do you know how long
I've been out here?
Let's get out of here.

00:17.951 --> 00:20.088
Dawny, I'm sorry. I'm--

00:20.120 --> 00:22.556
-You could have killed her.
-I need help.

00:22.589 --> 00:25.626
No more spells.
I'm finished.

00:28.562 --> 00:30.198
-Got it.
-It's beautiful.

00:30.231 --> 00:31.864
Congratulations.
Phase one of the plan
is now complete.

00:44.212 --> 00:47.347
Candles?
We can't have candles?

00:47.381 --> 00:50.451
Dawn,
it's a magic clearance.
Everything must go.

00:50.484 --> 00:52.652
B-But they're just candles.

00:54.921 --> 00:57.790
Well, yeah,
to you and me,
they're just candles,

00:57.825 --> 01:00.661
but to witches,
they're like bongs.

01:02.096 --> 01:03.564
(sighs)

01:03.597 --> 01:06.367
BUFFY:
So, no candles,
no charms.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.569
No--
Bird.

01:08.602 --> 01:11.805
No bird?
The peacock
on the table.

01:11.838 --> 01:13.573
It has
two crystals in it.

01:16.909 --> 01:20.248
Tara, she--
She left them.

01:21.948 --> 01:23.516
I'll make sure
she gets 'em.

01:29.956 --> 01:33.460
Dawn, do me a favor. Can you
grab the fertility god statue
on the desk over there?

01:33.493 --> 01:36.563
Kokopelli? No.
I love him.

01:36.597 --> 01:40.099
And he was Mom's.

01:40.134 --> 01:43.304
Why do we have to
get rid of so many
things I like?

01:43.337 --> 01:45.739
Dawn,
I explained this to you.

01:45.772 --> 01:47.974
Willow has a problem.

01:48.008 --> 01:52.111
The next few weeks are gonna be
crazy hard on her as it is.

01:52.146 --> 01:55.983
Any reminder of what it is
that she's trying
to stay away from,

01:56.015 --> 01:58.718
you know, could cause her
to give in to temptation.

02:08.527 --> 02:09.830
And that would be bad.

02:25.913 --> 02:29.949
Okay, that's it.
It's finally done.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.718
I mean, it still needs
a trial run, but it's--

02:31.752 --> 02:33.853
-Kinda clunky looking.
-What?

02:33.887 --> 02:37.625
I pictured something cooler--
more ILM, less Ed Wood.

02:37.658 --> 02:40.561
Do you wanna see cool?
I'll show you cool. Look.

02:57.076 --> 02:58.945
Mama.

03:01.348 --> 03:02.349
Did it?

03:03.383 --> 03:04.884
Is it--
Yeah.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.859
(gasps)

03:15.929 --> 03:19.567
(chair squeaks)
(laughing)

03:19.599 --> 03:21.669
Oh, I'd call that
a successful test.

03:21.701 --> 03:23.537
Oh, that's just
half the test.

03:24.905 --> 03:26.774
Hey. Hey!

03:32.445 --> 03:34.914
-You penis!
-Oh, cheer up, Frodo.

03:34.948 --> 03:36.949
Because thanks to my brains
and our mystical gem,

03:36.984 --> 03:39.552
we got ourselves
an invisibility ray.

03:39.586 --> 03:42.456
And I'd say that makes us
pretty much unstoppable.

03:44.658 --> 03:46.793
(theme music playing)

04:39.146 --> 04:41.180
Dawn, come on.
You gotta eat breakfast.

04:41.213 --> 04:42.882
Xander's gonna be here
any second.

04:44.016 --> 04:45.985
She's gonna be late
for school again.

04:51.358 --> 04:53.461
How you doing?
WILLOW: I'm okay.

04:53.494 --> 04:57.798
Not "ready to
head back to classes,
face the world" okay,

04:57.831 --> 05:01.802
but... the shakiness
is only semi now.

05:01.834 --> 05:04.204
I thought I'd spend the day
fishing the Net

05:04.237 --> 05:06.673
for more poop
on the stolen diamond.

05:06.706 --> 05:08.875
(footsteps)
I called you before.

05:09.877 --> 05:11.310
Didn't hear you.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.882
Hey, Dawnie,
I'm making you
a nice omelet.

05:15.915 --> 05:16.917
Not hungry.

05:17.918 --> 05:19.987
Dawn, you need
to eat something.

05:20.019 --> 05:22.755
-Thanks for your concern.
-(glass slams)

05:25.858 --> 05:27.995
Okay, I deserve
the wrath of Dawn,

05:28.028 --> 05:31.731
but why is she
taking it out on you?

05:31.764 --> 05:33.567
Because I let it happen.

05:33.600 --> 05:37.036
-Buffy, I was the one who--
-Who was drowning.

05:38.038 --> 05:39.038
My best friend.

05:40.374 --> 05:41.408
I was too wrapped up

05:41.442 --> 05:43.310
in my own dumb life
to even notice.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.911
Too--
(door bursts open)

05:44.944 --> 05:46.747
(sizzling)

05:50.951 --> 05:54.221
(sniffles)
Morning.

05:54.254 --> 05:58.091
What are you doing,
and here?

05:58.125 --> 06:00.226
Just, uh, took a stroll.

06:00.259 --> 06:02.562
Found myself in your neck
of the woods.

06:02.596 --> 06:06.199
Couldn't find a less flammable
time of day to take a stroll?

06:06.233 --> 06:09.569
Yeah, well, the fact is
my lighter's gone missing.

06:09.603 --> 06:11.704
Thought it might've
dropped out of my pocket
last time I was here.

06:11.738 --> 06:14.040
Haven't seen it.

06:14.074 --> 06:18.177
I'm gonna head back to my room.
Just... get dressed.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.779
Oh, I...

06:25.819 --> 06:27.855
-Lame.
-What?

06:27.887 --> 06:30.290
You.
Making up excuses.

06:30.322 --> 06:33.293
Don't flatter yourself, love.
Bloody fond of that lighter.

06:34.762 --> 06:38.264
Stop trying to see me
and stop calling me that.

06:41.268 --> 06:44.637
So, um, what should I
call you then?

06:45.906 --> 06:46.906
Pet?

06:48.675 --> 06:49.942
Sweetheart?

06:51.077 --> 06:53.646
My, uh,
little Goldilocks?

06:56.817 --> 06:59.952
You know, I love this hair,
the way it bounces around when--

06:59.987 --> 07:03.591
Uh-Uh-Uh-Uh! This flapjack's
not ready to be flipped.

07:03.624 --> 07:05.425
What the hell
is that supposed to--

07:06.660 --> 07:08.629
(quiet moan)

07:08.661 --> 07:11.831
(whispering)
No. Stop that.

07:12.932 --> 07:14.768
Good Godfrey Cambridge,
Spike!

07:14.802 --> 07:17.269
You still trying
to mack on Buffy?

07:17.303 --> 07:19.507
Wake up already.
Never gonna happen.

07:19.540 --> 07:22.242
Only a complete loser would
ever hook up with you.

07:22.274 --> 07:24.276
Well, unless she's
a simpleton like Harmony...

07:24.310 --> 07:26.613
or a nut sack
like Drusilla.
Hey!

07:26.646 --> 07:28.649
You really need
to get Dawn
off to school.

07:28.682 --> 07:30.684
Let's go--
go fetch her, okay?

07:30.718 --> 07:33.420
You can let yourself out,
right, Spike?

07:33.452 --> 07:35.923
-Dawn, you better get going.
Xander's here.
-I'm here.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.990
Okay, you have
everything you need?
Yep.

07:38.024 --> 07:39.992
And after school,
you--
Yeah. Let's go, Xander.

07:40.026 --> 07:42.095
You will
come straight home.

07:42.129 --> 07:44.598
Sure. Maybe we can
find some time

07:44.632 --> 07:47.199
for you to get me into
another car accident.

07:47.233 --> 07:49.769
Oh, good morning.
You must be Dawn.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.338
Huh?
BUFFY:
May I help you?

07:51.370 --> 07:55.875
I'm Doris Kroeger
from Social Services.
We had an appointment.

07:55.908 --> 07:59.045
-Oh, for Wednesday.
-This is Wednesday.

08:01.749 --> 08:04.985
Right. Well, Dawn,
you better--

08:05.017 --> 08:08.622
(sighs)
And, Xander,
you'll drive safely.

08:08.656 --> 08:09.723
Yes, ma'am.

08:11.559 --> 08:13.793
A little bit
on the tardy side,
isn't she?

08:13.826 --> 08:16.096
Yeah, well, it's been one
of those mornings, you know.

08:17.531 --> 08:19.699
Great. Come on in.

08:19.733 --> 08:23.836
Sorry about the mess.
We're doing a little
house clean.

08:23.870 --> 08:26.372
So, we gonna chat this out
or what?

08:28.608 --> 08:31.310
Uh, now's really
not a good time.

08:31.343 --> 08:34.047
Um, I have company.

08:34.081 --> 08:36.549
No worries.
I'll wait.

08:36.583 --> 08:39.418
Um, Miss Summers, if you
and your boyfriend...

08:39.451 --> 08:41.654
would like to--
He is not--

08:41.688 --> 08:43.856
(clears throat)
Not my-- my boyfriend.

08:43.890 --> 08:46.693
He's, um, just, uh--

08:46.726 --> 08:52.198
Spike, this nice woman is,
uh, from Social Services.

08:52.231 --> 08:54.067
Oh, right.

08:54.100 --> 08:58.672
Uh, hey,
Buffy's a great mum.

08:58.706 --> 09:01.274
She takes good care
of her little sis.

09:01.307 --> 09:05.245
Like, um,
when Dawn was hanging out
too much in my crypt,

09:05.278 --> 09:07.514
Buffy put a right stop to it.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.582
I'm sorry.
Did you say--
BUFFY: Crib. Crib.

09:09.616 --> 09:12.384
(laughing)
He said crib.

09:12.418 --> 09:16.056
You know kids today
and their buggin'
street slang.

09:16.088 --> 09:19.359
Uh, Spike, didn't you have
to go now, you know?
Because of that thing.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.227
Uh, thing.
Uh, my blanket.

09:33.774 --> 09:34.807
He sleeps here?

09:36.143 --> 09:38.378
What? No. No.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.947
Oh, th-th-the blanket.

09:40.980 --> 09:44.317
That's, um--
It's a security thing, yeah.

09:44.350 --> 09:46.418
He has issues.

09:46.452 --> 09:49.588
No. Just me and Dawn
living here.

09:49.623 --> 09:53.326
WILLOW: Buffy, I'm not
feeling hot, so I'm gonna
take a quick nap, okay?

09:53.360 --> 09:54.794
O-Okay, Wil!

09:56.996 --> 09:59.732
That's Willow.
She, uh--

09:59.767 --> 10:02.402
She kind of lives here,
too, actually.

10:02.434 --> 10:04.672
Oh, so you live
with another woman?

10:04.705 --> 10:08.741
Oh. Oh, it's not
a gay thing, you know.

10:08.775 --> 10:12.412
I mean, well, she's gay,
but we don't gay--

10:12.445 --> 10:14.648
Not that there's anything--
oh-- wrong with--

10:14.682 --> 10:16.917
You know, I know
what that looks like,

10:16.950 --> 10:19.119
but I-I-- I swear it's not
what it looks like.

10:19.152 --> 10:20.386
It's magic weed.

10:21.488 --> 10:23.222
It's not mine.

10:24.624 --> 10:27.293
I think
I've seen enough.
No.

10:27.326 --> 10:29.629
Actually, I really don't
think that you have.

10:29.663 --> 10:34.466
It's just-- It's been kind of--
kind of a bad time.

10:34.500 --> 10:37.037
It's been a bad time
now for a while,
hasn't it, Miss Summers?

10:37.070 --> 10:40.307
Your sister's grades
have fallen sharply
in the last year

10:40.340 --> 10:44.476
due in large part
to her frequent absences
and lateness.

10:44.510 --> 10:47.947
But there are
good reasons.
I'm sure there are.

10:47.980 --> 10:50.182
But my interest
is in Dawn's welfare

10:50.216 --> 10:52.284
and the stability
of her home life--

10:52.318 --> 10:54.386
something I'm just
not convinced

10:54.421 --> 10:56.856
that an unemployed young woman
like yourself can provide.

10:56.889 --> 10:59.158
I can. I-I do.

10:59.192 --> 11:01.628
Well, we'll just have
to see about that then,
won't we?

11:01.660 --> 11:06.866
Oh, and I'm going to recommend
immediate probation
in my report.

11:06.899 --> 11:08.235
What does that mean?

11:08.268 --> 11:10.169
It means that
I'll be monitoring you

11:10.202 --> 11:11.504
very closely, Miss Summers.

11:11.538 --> 11:14.140
And if I don't see
that things are improving,

11:14.173 --> 11:16.009
well, I'll be forced
to recommend that
you be stripped

11:16.043 --> 11:17.811
of your sister's guardianship.

11:17.845 --> 11:19.779
You can't do that.

11:22.048 --> 11:24.884
I do what is in Dawn's
best interest,

11:24.918 --> 11:26.754
as should you.

11:27.754 --> 11:29.121
Have a nice day.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.592
(sighs)

11:36.129 --> 11:37.898
Didn't go well, huh?

11:40.299 --> 11:41.567
Why won't you go?

11:42.970 --> 11:45.471
I just thought
you'd want--
Get out of here!

11:53.645 --> 11:55.081
Just getting
what I came for, love.

11:57.985 --> 11:59.485
So long, Goldilocks.

12:01.087 --> 12:03.722
(gasps)
(door opens, closes)

12:12.499 --> 12:14.567
(sniffles, cries)

12:45.432 --> 12:48.802
Well, I-I think
I can work with this.

12:48.836 --> 12:50.336
What exactly would you
like me to do?

12:51.838 --> 12:54.274
Just make me...
different.

12:56.943 --> 12:58.577
I'm scared.
What if we
get caught?

12:58.610 --> 13:01.480
No way. We'll be invisible.
Plus their security's
gotten lax.

13:01.514 --> 13:03.515
You should know.
You've cased
this joint enough.

13:05.317 --> 13:06.619
WARREN:
Okay, this is it.

13:07.955 --> 13:10.722
Remember.
We're professionals.

13:14.226 --> 13:16.296
-Uh, Slayer.
-What? W-Where?

13:16.328 --> 13:18.230
There.
Headed this way.

13:23.735 --> 13:25.972
-JONATHAN: Give it!
-No. I need to be invisible.

13:26.005 --> 13:28.307
I need it more.
Buffy can't see me!
Ah!

13:28.341 --> 13:31.043
Watch it! Don't--
Don't-- Give it!
Give it!

13:31.077 --> 13:33.145
WARREN:
Ah! You overloaded it!

13:40.720 --> 13:41.922
Oopsie.

13:48.695 --> 13:51.197
What happened to Buffy?
She's gone.

13:51.230 --> 13:54.533
She's right here-- table four.
I put her with your family.

13:54.567 --> 13:57.370
Great. Except we don't
 hate Buffy.

13:57.403 --> 13:59.471
Let's put her back
at table one.
(footsteps)

13:59.505 --> 14:01.173
ANYA:
Where do I put D'Hoffryn?

14:01.207 --> 14:03.009
XANDER:
We're not inviting D'Hoffryn.

14:03.043 --> 14:04.912
ANYA: I have to.
He's my ex-boss.

14:04.945 --> 14:08.181
You're inviting
your work buddies.
BUFFY: She's got a point.

14:08.215 --> 14:09.282
Hey, Buffy--

14:12.019 --> 14:14.754
Where-- Where are you?

14:14.787 --> 14:17.090
BUFFY:
At table four apparently.

14:17.124 --> 14:20.894
Well, that remains
to be seen... like you.

14:22.229 --> 14:24.163
BUFFY:
Don't strain yourself
looking, Xander.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.365
I'm Invisible Girl.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.269
BUFFY: Uh, Xander?
Sorry!

14:30.470 --> 14:34.908
Her clothes are, uh,
invisible... too.

14:34.942 --> 14:37.911
(chuckles)
Buffy, how did
this hap--

14:39.446 --> 14:42.115
Wait a sec. Have you been
feeling ignored lately?

14:42.149 --> 14:44.616
BUFFY:
Yeah, ignored. I wish.

14:44.650 --> 14:47.720
No, this isn't a Marcie deal.
I don't know what happened.

14:47.754 --> 14:50.722
-I left Main Street after
getting my hair cut and was--
-You cut your hair?

14:50.756 --> 14:54.126
-BUFFY: Oh, yeah.
-Really? How short?

14:54.161 --> 14:56.696
BUFFY: About up to here.
Well, if you could see my hand,

14:56.729 --> 14:59.466
it's kind of
above my shoulders.
Ah, that sounds so adorable.

14:59.499 --> 15:01.600
I was thinking about
getting my hair cut
before the wedding.

15:01.634 --> 15:03.302
Could we get back
to freaking out
about no-show Buffy?

15:03.336 --> 15:05.371
This is serious.
BUFFY: I know.

15:05.404 --> 15:08.774
It kind of fits
the day I've had.

15:08.807 --> 15:11.278
Willow's still a wreck,
Dawn's mad at both of us,

15:11.311 --> 15:14.214
and the Social Services lady
put me through a wringer.

15:14.246 --> 15:18.551
Says she's gonna watch me.
I'd like to see her try now.

15:18.585 --> 15:21.254
You know, there may be
an upside to no-see me.

15:21.288 --> 15:23.590
XANDER:
Buff, did you see
anyone or...

15:23.623 --> 15:26.326
anything suspicious
before you...

15:27.793 --> 15:29.629
cleared up?

15:29.662 --> 15:31.298
BUFFY:
Nope. Didn't see nothin'.

15:31.331 --> 15:33.500
Hmm. See what I did there
with the eyeballs?

15:35.934 --> 15:38.270
Why would anyone make
her invisible anyway?

15:38.304 --> 15:42.274
I mean, invisible Slayer's
gotta be way more effective
than the standard variety.

15:42.308 --> 15:45.312
Yeah. I'm less with the "why"
and more with the "how."

15:45.345 --> 15:49.615
We get the "how," then we got
how to make her unseen sight
seen again, right?

15:49.649 --> 15:51.350
BUFFY:
S'all right.

15:51.384 --> 15:53.753
Buffy, could you focus,
please?

15:53.786 --> 15:56.655
I am. Just--
This is kind of fun.

15:56.688 --> 15:59.759
Well, it would help if we had
a little bit more to go on.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.162
Or anything to go on.

16:02.195 --> 16:05.298
Well, I could go check the spot
where Buffy disappeared,

16:05.331 --> 16:07.466
you know, snoop for clues.

16:07.500 --> 16:11.303
BUFFY:
Yeah. Right.
Uh, hey, you know what?

16:11.337 --> 16:13.639
I'm just gonna
go for a walk.

16:13.673 --> 16:16.875
A walk?
BUFFY: Yeah. You know,
clear my head.

16:16.908 --> 16:19.946
You guys keep working
on the "whats"
and the "hows."

16:19.979 --> 16:22.315
(chuckles)
"Clear my head."
Buffy!

16:27.586 --> 16:32.325
Uh, it seems pretty obvious
it's some kind of spell
that's done this to her.

16:32.359 --> 16:34.461
A spell from who?
You said it yourself.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.995
It makes no sense
for one of her enemies
to make her invisible.

16:38.365 --> 16:41.734
Maybe it's a mistake.
A magical mistake.

16:41.768 --> 16:43.536
Who'd be messing
with that kind of pow--

16:59.052 --> 17:00.919
(door opens)
XANDER:
Willow.

17:00.952 --> 17:02.554
Xander.

17:02.589 --> 17:06.726
How's it going?
Um, good.

17:06.759 --> 17:11.931
I-I found out some stuff
about the diamond
stolen from the museum.

17:11.963 --> 17:13.531
It's called
the Illuminata.

17:13.566 --> 17:16.903
There's rumors of it
having quasi-mystical
quantum properties.

17:16.935 --> 17:20.006
Willow, we need to talk.

17:20.038 --> 17:23.076
We ar talking.
Well, I'm talking,
and you're looking at me funny.

17:23.108 --> 17:24.810
Is there something
you want to tell me?

17:27.980 --> 17:31.851
It was nothing.
I-I-- I didn't slip.
Wil, nobody's mad.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.921
Relapse is a part
of recovery.
We understand that.

17:34.953 --> 17:36.722
We just have to figure
a way to fix it.

17:37.957 --> 17:38.958
Fix what?

17:38.990 --> 17:42.060
Fix Buffy.
Buffy's broken?

17:42.095 --> 17:43.296
Wil, you know
what I'm talking...

17:44.297 --> 17:45.597
You don't know?

17:48.268 --> 17:51.938
Rhymes with...
"blinvisible"?
What?

17:51.971 --> 17:54.606
Buffy was in town, leaving
the haircutting place

17:54.641 --> 17:56.643
-when she suddenly just--
-Buffy got her hair cut?

17:56.675 --> 17:59.612
Yeah! Adorable apparently.

17:59.645 --> 18:02.882
I personally couldn't tell
since she's all "blinvisible."

18:02.914 --> 18:05.218
And you think I have
something to do with this?

18:05.251 --> 18:09.122
No. Not--

18:09.155 --> 18:12.159
Well, come on, Wil.
Some of the spells you've done
have caused some weird stuff

18:12.192 --> 18:14.093
to happen to each of us
at one time or another.

18:14.126 --> 18:17.763
-And let's not forget
the recent forgetting.
-Oh, I see.

18:17.797 --> 18:21.834
So, now when anything nasty
happens, I get conveniently
blamed for it?

18:21.867 --> 18:26.405
-No one's blaming.
-So I guess
it wouldn't matter

18:26.439 --> 18:28.508
if I just jump off the wagon
completely,

18:28.540 --> 18:30.942
since you already think
I'm making pit stops.

18:30.977 --> 18:32.545
Look, if you say
you didn't do it--

18:33.680 --> 18:36.015
Willow, where you going?
For a walk.

18:41.188 --> 18:43.690
A couple of circuits
are burned out,
and the wiring's all fried.

18:43.722 --> 18:46.292
But we had
so many plans.

18:46.326 --> 18:50.797
Naked women and all--
Well, all the naked women.

18:50.829 --> 18:52.598
This is your fault.
If you hadn't
grabbed it from me--

18:52.632 --> 18:55.167
Hey, we got a lot bigger
problems here, bonehead.

18:55.201 --> 18:58.037
-The Slayer's invisible now.
-He's right.

18:59.070 --> 19:00.173
She could be anywhere.

19:00.207 --> 19:02.174
Even here,
right now.

19:03.710 --> 19:07.779
Watching, listening
to every word we say.

19:07.814 --> 19:10.916
For all we know,
she could be one of us.

19:14.487 --> 19:17.656
Oh!
No, wait.
(mumbling)

19:17.690 --> 19:19.726
I wouldn't sweat
the Slayer too much.

19:19.759 --> 19:21.294
(scoffs)
Says you.

19:21.327 --> 19:24.730
In my book, an invisible Slayer
means a whole world of trouble.

19:26.065 --> 19:28.500
(footsteps)

19:32.704 --> 19:36.075
BUFFY:
I am the Ghost
of Fashion Victims Past.

19:36.107 --> 19:38.845
Studded caps--
not a good idea.

19:40.346 --> 19:42.615
Hey, I'm doing you
a favor!

19:46.018 --> 19:47.920
Nah. Too easy.

19:49.422 --> 19:52.090
(device beeping)

19:52.124 --> 19:55.193
Hmm.
(engine revs)

19:55.228 --> 19:57.263
So long, copper!

19:57.297 --> 20:00.599
Hey. Hey!
That's mine! Stop!

20:06.739 --> 20:08.575
BUFFY:
Hello, Mrs. Kroeger.

20:11.577 --> 20:13.712
(phone ringing)

20:24.590 --> 20:26.492
(sighs)

20:31.931 --> 20:34.733
What?
Where's my--

20:38.170 --> 20:41.073
(chuckling)
Losing my mind.

20:45.345 --> 20:47.279
Ah.

20:53.019 --> 20:55.121
Okay. Who's the--

20:58.290 --> 21:01.259
BUFFY (softly):
Kill, kill, kill.

21:01.294 --> 21:03.996
-What?
-I didn't say anything.

21:04.864 --> 21:06.932
Not you, the mug. It's--

21:12.939 --> 21:14.973
But I, uh--
I heard something.

21:18.611 --> 21:21.247
BUFFY:
Kill, Doris.
Kill everybody.

21:21.279 --> 21:22.914
You know you want to.
Shut up. Shut up.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.683
Just shut up!

21:34.861 --> 21:36.863
BUFFY:
Okay. No.

21:37.963 --> 21:38.897
No.

21:39.898 --> 21:41.133
Yahtzee.

21:52.644 --> 21:55.448
Doris, I've got a few,

21:55.481 --> 21:58.217
so if you want to discuss
that case file now.

21:58.250 --> 22:02.221
What? Oh. Oh, yes.
The, um, Summers file.

22:02.253 --> 22:04.056
It's , uh--
It's right over here.

22:06.057 --> 22:10.028
Uh-- Uh, it's
a 15-year-old girl...
Mm-hmm.

22:10.061 --> 22:12.064
living under her older
sister's guardianship.

22:12.097 --> 22:14.200
The house
is a complete--
What is this?

22:14.232 --> 22:17.470
"All work and no play
make Doris a dull girl."
What?

22:17.503 --> 22:20.338
"All work and no play
make Doris--"

22:20.373 --> 22:24.175
The pages
are filled with it.
Uh. I-I--

22:26.846 --> 22:29.115
I-I-- I didn't do this.
I--

22:30.450 --> 22:33.219
It was the voice.
Excuse me?

22:34.185 --> 22:36.355
There was a voice
before.

22:36.388 --> 22:38.590
It made
my coffee dance.

22:38.625 --> 22:41.927
It told me to--
To what?

22:45.096 --> 22:46.265
Nothing.

22:47.866 --> 22:49.101
Doris...

22:49.134 --> 22:51.336
uh, take the rest
of the day off.

22:51.369 --> 22:54.039
See your doctor.
What about my cases?

22:54.073 --> 22:56.542
We'll, uh, put
someone else on them

22:56.576 --> 22:59.377
and have them redo
the Summers interview.

22:59.412 --> 23:01.614
(Buffy whistling)
I'm not crazy.

23:01.647 --> 23:06.117
I am not crazy!
MAN: No one said
that you were.

23:06.152 --> 23:09.121
(continues whistling)
(chatter, indistinct)

23:10.288 --> 23:13.593
(spray can rattling,
paint spraying)

23:15.595 --> 23:19.566
Hey, Wil.
What you doin'?

23:19.598 --> 23:23.201
Look, Xander, I figured out this
is where Buffy disappeared,
from what you told me,

23:23.234 --> 23:25.637
so don't start jumping
to any conclusions.

23:25.672 --> 23:28.140
No jumping. Look,
feet firmly planted.

23:30.676 --> 23:33.278
I'm not feeling like myself
right now. Sorry.

23:33.311 --> 23:36.949
Me too. Sorry.

23:36.982 --> 23:40.219
So, what have we
found out so far?
Take a look at that.

23:40.251 --> 23:42.822
Something sped out of here
pretty damn quick

23:42.855 --> 23:44.891
to make that kind
of tread mark.

23:44.923 --> 23:48.326
-Those could have
been made anytime.
-Yeah, but this wasn't.

23:51.763 --> 23:54.767
What is it?
Paint that I scraped
off the fire hydrant.

23:54.800 --> 23:56.669
Oh. What fire hydrant?
(loud clank)

23:56.702 --> 23:58.637
Ow!
That one.

24:00.606 --> 24:04.242
Whatever hit this fire hydrant
hit it after it was
made invisible.

24:04.276 --> 24:06.311
And betcha-by-golly-wow,
that something...

24:06.345 --> 24:08.446
was the same something
that shot out of that alley.

24:09.949 --> 24:12.852
Black paint?
Buffy's phantom van.

24:12.884 --> 24:17.288
We need to let Buffy-- Whoa!
There's something there.

24:17.323 --> 24:19.959
(paint spraying)

24:19.991 --> 24:24.296
It-It's a pylon. One of those
orange traffic cones.

24:24.329 --> 24:26.265
You should take it
to the Magic Box.

24:26.298 --> 24:29.335
It might help you and Anya
figure out what kind
of spell was used.

24:29.367 --> 24:32.171
-What about you?
-Well, I got paint scrapings...

24:33.640 --> 24:34.973
and a tire mark.

24:35.007 --> 24:37.876
I'm gonna find this van
that's been stalking Buffy.

24:37.910 --> 24:39.811
By the way,
where is Buffy?

24:39.846 --> 24:42.448
(woman screams on TV)

24:42.480 --> 24:44.784
WOMAN:
Oh, my God. The blood!
Look at all the blood!

24:44.817 --> 24:47.486
(scary movie music)
(stomach growls)

24:58.664 --> 25:01.701
(door opens)
(TV continues, indistinct)

25:01.733 --> 25:03.736
(footsteps)

25:12.344 --> 25:14.846
Whatever beastie you are,
I know you're here,

25:14.881 --> 25:16.382
and I hurt beasties.

25:18.349 --> 25:20.819
Hey, watch it.
(TV switches off)

25:20.853 --> 25:23.521
(sighs)

25:23.556 --> 25:27.894
A ghost, is it?
Go and haunt the living
like a good spook.

25:27.926 --> 25:30.362
(footsteps)

25:35.801 --> 25:37.536
-(blow thuds)
-Wh--

25:49.915 --> 25:52.084
Buffy?
BUFFY:
I told you--

25:52.117 --> 25:54.220
stop trying to see me.
(grunts)

26:00.058 --> 26:02.060
-Oh, I got it.
-Really?

26:02.094 --> 26:04.596
Yeah. We'll put D'Hoffryn
at your parents' table

26:04.631 --> 26:07.799
and move your Uncle Rory
to table five near the bar.

26:09.401 --> 26:12.939
An, honey, we're looking
for invisibility spells here.

26:12.971 --> 26:15.106
Well, obviously, I haven't
found anything yet.

26:15.141 --> 26:20.046
At least nothing that would
explain why things near Buffy
become invisible.

26:20.078 --> 26:23.048
Eww! Xander.

26:23.082 --> 26:26.551
What happened?
An unpleasant
tactile experience--

26:26.585 --> 26:28.119
like putting my hand
in pudding.

26:30.189 --> 26:33.424
-Eww!
-Like pudding.

26:33.459 --> 26:36.729
Am I right?
Rice or tapioca--
lumpy like that.

26:36.762 --> 26:39.164
We have to find Buffy.
She's gotta know.

26:39.198 --> 26:41.599
I don't think Buffy's
gonna be too broken up
over a pylon.

26:41.634 --> 26:45.304
Anya, whatever's happening
to the pylon will probably
happen to her.

26:45.336 --> 26:49.776
If we don't find Buffy--
I mean, if we don't
figure out how this was done--

26:49.808 --> 26:51.644
She's pudding?

26:59.719 --> 27:01.788
What do you mean
she's gonna fade away?

27:01.820 --> 27:04.656
The Slayer got slammed with
a big-ass dose of radiation
when the gun overloaded.

27:04.691 --> 27:06.659
Her cells are mutating
at an accelerated rate.

27:06.692 --> 27:10.797
Eventually, her molecular makeup
will start losing its integrity,
and then-- pfft.

27:10.829 --> 27:13.665
-But wouldn't that kill her?
-Let me think.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.769
Yeah.
Wait a minute.

27:16.803 --> 27:19.471
We're not killing anybody,
especially not Buffy.

27:19.505 --> 27:22.173
You guys are so immature.
We're villains!

27:22.208 --> 27:24.175
When you gonna
get that through
your thick skulls?

27:24.210 --> 27:26.345
We're not killers.
We're crime lords.

27:26.377 --> 27:28.346
Yeah, like--
like Lex Luthor.

27:28.380 --> 27:31.683
He's always trying
to take over Metropolis,
but he doesn't kill Superman.

27:31.718 --> 27:34.052
Because it's Superman's
book, you moron!

27:34.086 --> 27:36.055
Well, Lex doesn't kill him,
does he?

27:38.156 --> 27:40.992
Listen, Warren--
You get that ray working,

27:41.027 --> 27:42.961
and the first thing we're
gonna do is find Buffy

27:42.994 --> 27:44.697
and "re-visible" her
before it's too late.

27:46.833 --> 27:48.034
You got me?

27:49.434 --> 27:50.435
Fine.

27:54.272 --> 27:55.741
Whatever you guys say.

28:03.682 --> 28:04.549
Spike?

28:15.461 --> 28:17.429
(Spike and Buffy moaning)

28:22.201 --> 28:23.201
Spike?

28:25.904 --> 28:27.073
What are you doing?

28:29.275 --> 28:32.611
What am I--
What does it look like
I'm doing, you nit?

28:32.644 --> 28:34.512
I'm exercising,
aren't I?

28:34.546 --> 28:36.414
(grunting)
(Buffy gasps)

28:36.448 --> 28:38.884
Exercising... naked...

28:39.951 --> 28:40.987
in bed.

28:43.088 --> 28:46.893
A man shouldn't use immortality
as an excuse to let himself go.

28:46.925 --> 28:48.894
You gotta keep fit
for the killing.

28:50.662 --> 28:52.298
Yeah-huh.

28:52.330 --> 28:56.434
Looks like you had a little
trouble upstairs--
a mini disaster area.

28:56.468 --> 28:59.238
So what, you just come here
to criticize my housekeeping?

28:59.270 --> 29:01.874
No. Uh, no.
I'm looking for Buffy.

29:01.907 --> 29:04.375
Haven't seen her.
Well, you wouldn't.

29:04.410 --> 29:07.378
Fact is, she's come down
with a slight case
of invisibility.

29:07.413 --> 29:10.916
-Yeah? Huh.
How did, uh--
-We don't know yet.

29:10.950 --> 29:12.651
(Buffy moans softly)
(gasps)

29:12.683 --> 29:15.753
Anyway, she's not at the house,
and I really, really
need to find her.

29:15.855 --> 29:20.491
Tell you what. I'll take a peek
around first chance I get,

29:21.660 --> 29:23.261
and, if we bump
into each other,

29:23.295 --> 29:25.364
I'll clue her that you're
on the lookout.

29:27.032 --> 29:30.336
After your... exercises.

29:30.368 --> 29:33.204
Yeah, right.

29:35.273 --> 29:38.443
You know,
kidding aside, Spike,

29:38.477 --> 29:40.046
you really should
get a girlfriend.

29:41.313 --> 29:42.314
(sighs)

29:43.481 --> 29:45.517
That was bloody stupid.
(door opens, closes)

29:45.550 --> 29:48.420
BUFFY:
What's the matter?
Ashamed to be seen with me?

29:48.453 --> 29:51.457
Come on. He had no idea
I was here.

29:51.490 --> 29:53.525
This is perfect.

29:53.558 --> 29:54.625
Perfect for you.

29:55.862 --> 29:58.197
BUFFY:
Well, picture me confused.

29:58.230 --> 29:59.832
I thought this is
what you wanted.

29:59.865 --> 30:02.134
(scoffs)
What I want--

30:07.138 --> 30:10.642
This vanishing act's
right liberating for you,
isn't it?

30:10.675 --> 30:14.512
Go anywhere you want,
do anything you want.

30:14.546 --> 30:17.348
Or anyone.
BUFFY: What are
you talking about?

30:17.383 --> 30:20.185
The only reason you're here
is that you're not here.

30:20.219 --> 30:23.454
Right, of course. As usual,
there's something wrong
with Buffy.

30:23.489 --> 30:27.459
She came back all wrong.
You know, I didn't ask
for this to happen to me.

30:27.492 --> 30:29.795
Not too put off by it,
though, are you?

30:29.827 --> 30:32.530
BUFFY:
No. Maybe 'cause for
the first time since--

30:32.564 --> 30:34.400
I'm free.

30:35.834 --> 30:38.104
Free of rules
and reports.

30:39.204 --> 30:42.407
-Free of this life.
-Free of life?

30:42.441 --> 30:45.644
Got another name for that--
"dead."

30:45.676 --> 30:47.246
BUFFY:
Why do you always have to--

30:48.346 --> 30:50.148
I thought
we were having fun.

30:50.182 --> 30:52.718
Yeah, now. But sooner or later,

30:52.750 --> 30:55.221
your chums are gonna work out
a way to bring you back
to living color.

30:59.125 --> 31:00.192
You need to go.

31:02.428 --> 31:04.395
Get dressed-- if you can find
your clothes-- and push off.

31:04.430 --> 31:08.467
'Cause if I can't have
all of you, I'd rather--
Hey, that's cheating.

31:37.729 --> 31:40.731
(beeping)

31:45.270 --> 31:47.772
BUFFY:
I don't believe this.

31:47.806 --> 31:51.376
He threw me out?
He threw me.

31:51.410 --> 31:54.613
Did I, like, fall into some
backward dimension here?

31:54.645 --> 31:56.015
Is this Bizarro world?

31:57.316 --> 31:59.617
And after he's always
going on and on about

31:59.651 --> 32:02.554
being the only one
that understands me.

32:02.587 --> 32:05.624
(imitating Spike)
We're alike, you and me.
Birds of a bloody feather.

32:05.656 --> 32:09.127
(chattering)
BUFFY:
Oh, he's just so--

32:09.161 --> 32:12.330
Hey, I'm walking here!

32:12.364 --> 32:14.599
Insensitive.
It is.

32:21.039 --> 32:23.275
Willow? Willow!

32:25.310 --> 32:27.778
Dawn?
Hey, Dawn, come here.

32:27.813 --> 32:29.115
You wanna see
something neat?

32:30.781 --> 32:32.284
(sighs)

32:51.670 --> 32:53.672
There you are!
(gasps)

32:53.704 --> 32:56.875
Buffy?
Where are you?

32:56.907 --> 32:58.743
BUFFY:
I'm invisible.
Check this out.

33:01.012 --> 33:02.614
Whoooo. Whoooo.

33:02.647 --> 33:05.983
Unidentified flying pizza
coming in for a landing.

33:08.586 --> 33:11.856
W-What are you talking--
BUFFY: Okay, not the most
clever ad lib.

33:11.890 --> 33:14.226
But come on--
 points for spontaneity.
Stop it.

33:14.259 --> 33:16.461
-Just... stop.
-BUFFY: Sorry, Dawn.

33:16.494 --> 33:19.830
I'm-- I'm sorry.
I didn't mean
to freak you out.

33:19.865 --> 33:22.968
What would you think would
happen? You're freakin'
invisible, Buffy.

33:23.000 --> 33:26.305
I know. Xander and Anya
are working on it,
"Muldering" out what happened.

33:26.337 --> 33:29.040
What about you? Shouldn't you
be working on it?

33:29.075 --> 33:32.177
-Of course, I--
-Do you even care about--
about who did this to you

33:32.211 --> 33:34.480
or-- or if you're gonna
be stuck this way?

33:34.512 --> 33:37.348
You're making jokes
and flying pizzas.
BUFFY: I don't think that's--

33:37.383 --> 33:40.586
I can't talk to you like this.
I can't see you.

33:40.618 --> 33:42.488
How can I talk to you
if I can't see you?
(bump)

33:42.520 --> 33:44.455
BUFFY:
Dawn! Dawn!

33:50.461 --> 33:53.699
(beeps)
Buffy, it's Xander.
Where are you?

33:53.731 --> 33:56.234
Listen, we got
a new problem here.

33:56.268 --> 33:58.036
ANYA: Tell her.
XANDER:
I'm trying to.

33:58.069 --> 34:00.672
Anya and I think
whatever made you invisible
is slowly killing you.

34:00.705 --> 34:02.874
ANYA: Tell her about
the pudding.
XANDER: Anya!

34:02.907 --> 34:06.978
Buff, if we don't--
If this isn't reversed,
you're gonna,

34:07.078 --> 34:11.449
well, dissolve or fade...
into nothing.

34:11.483 --> 34:13.119
(beeps)

34:15.987 --> 34:17.822
BUFFY:
Wow.

35:38.369 --> 35:39.371
WARREN:
Now!

35:41.306 --> 35:44.675
Hey! Let go of me!

35:44.710 --> 35:47.346
WARREN:
Congratulations.
You're our first hostage.

35:55.753 --> 35:57.322
BUFFY:
Dawn, I'm going out
to find Xander!

35:57.356 --> 35:59.557
If he calls--
(phone rings)

36:01.659 --> 36:03.829
(ringing continues)

36:06.264 --> 36:08.699
Xander?
JONATHAN: Don't talk.
Just listen, Slayer.

36:08.733 --> 36:10.402
You don't have
a lot of time.

36:10.436 --> 36:12.538
BUFFY:
Who is this?
You sound familiar.

36:12.570 --> 36:16.574
JONATHAN (alters voice):
I'm nobody.
No one you know.

36:16.608 --> 36:20.177
We've got your friend Willow,
and if you don't want anything
nasty to happen to her,

36:20.211 --> 36:22.481
you better meet us...
alone.

36:22.514 --> 36:24.682
Where?

36:24.715 --> 36:27.418
(video games beeping)
(kids chattering)

36:36.961 --> 36:38.396
Hey!

36:38.429 --> 36:40.365
(chattering, grunting)

36:40.398 --> 36:43.168
Hey!
Oh!

36:43.201 --> 36:45.103
WARREN:
Just stay still,
and you won't get hurt.

36:45.135 --> 36:47.072
BUFFY:
You okay, Wil?
Buffy?

36:47.105 --> 36:48.539
Where are the bad guys?

36:48.574 --> 36:50.775
WARREN:
All around you, Slayer,
so don't try anything.

36:50.809 --> 36:54.112
He's bluffing, Buffy.
There-- There's just
three of them, I think.

36:54.144 --> 36:56.815
WARREN: More than enough
to cause some serious carnage,
right, guys?

36:57.815 --> 36:59.617
Guys? Guys!

36:59.650 --> 37:01.586
-JONATHAN:
Kick! Use the kick!
-ANDREW: I tried that.

37:01.619 --> 37:03.889
He keeps blocking it
with his Drunken Monkey Fist.

37:03.922 --> 37:06.056
BUFFY:
Oh. Scary video carnage.

37:06.090 --> 37:08.594
WARREN:
Hey! Slayer's here.

37:08.626 --> 37:10.461
ANDREW:
Sorry. Didn't see her.

37:10.496 --> 37:13.565
WARREN: Why don't we
continue this in a less
crowded area, like over there?

37:13.599 --> 37:16.534
-ALL: Where?
-WARREN: Over-- Follow me.

37:16.568 --> 37:19.704
Ow! Ow.

37:19.737 --> 37:22.474
BUFFY: I'm gonna go out
on a limb and guess you're
the ones that did this to me.

37:22.507 --> 37:24.543
-JONATHAN:
It was an accident.
-BUFFY: Who's that?

37:24.576 --> 37:26.378
JONATHAN: (alters voice)
Nobody you know.

37:26.411 --> 37:29.815
They're the ones
from your mystery van.
BUFFY: Oh. You.

37:29.847 --> 37:32.884
So what annoying thing are
you gonna do to me now?

37:32.918 --> 37:34.619
WARREN:
Save your life--
make you visible.

37:34.652 --> 37:36.253
BUFFY:
Right. I'm supposed
to believe that?

37:36.288 --> 37:38.222
They told me
everything, Buffy.

37:38.255 --> 37:41.793
-Something's happening
to you, that you're--
-BUFFY: Fading away. I know.

37:41.827 --> 37:44.963
WARREN: I can fix that.
Pick up that air hockey
mallet on the table.

37:44.996 --> 37:47.798
-BUFFY: What for?
-WARREN: It'll give me
a target to aim at.

37:50.501 --> 37:53.103
Now hold still,
and all your troubles
will soon be gone.

37:53.137 --> 37:55.606
-You're on
the wrong setting.
-WARREN: What?

37:55.641 --> 37:59.445
The gun,
it's not set for reversing
the particle ionization.

37:59.478 --> 38:02.414
It'll accelerate
her molecular dissolution.
I saw the plans.

38:02.447 --> 38:03.481
(Warren slaps)
Mind your own business.
Ow.

38:03.514 --> 38:04.615
JONATHAN:
What's she talking about?

38:04.650 --> 38:05.784
BUFFY: That's what
I'd like to know.

38:05.817 --> 38:07.518
Buffy, he's trying
to kill you! (grunts)

38:07.552 --> 38:10.956
-BUFFY: Willow!
-WARREN: Ow!

38:10.989 --> 38:13.824
-BUFFY: Okay, playtime's over.
-WARREN: You haven't
won yet, Slayer.

38:13.858 --> 38:16.362
BUFFY:
No. That part comes after
I beat the snot out of you.

38:16.394 --> 38:17.663
WARREN:
You'll have
to find me first.

38:17.695 --> 38:20.297
there's three of us
against just one of you.

38:20.331 --> 38:22.434
JONATHAN:
Hey, you lied to us.
ANDREW: Fight her yourself.

38:22.467 --> 38:24.869
WARREN: You think
she cares about that?
I go down, we all go down.

38:24.902 --> 38:26.771
BUFFY:
And I promise,
you're all going down.

38:26.804 --> 38:28.639
WARREN:
We may not have
your powers, Slayer,

38:28.673 --> 38:30.342
but you'll find
that we are not so easy to--

38:30.376 --> 38:32.344
Ow! Get her!

38:32.378 --> 38:36.882
(grunting)
(punches, kicks thudding)

38:43.188 --> 38:45.490
JONATHAN:
Wait a minute.
Who's biting my leg?

38:45.523 --> 38:47.291
ANDREW:
Sorry. Where is she?
BUFFY: Here.

38:47.324 --> 38:49.159
(punch lands)
ANDREW:
Whoa!

38:49.193 --> 38:50.829
(people yelling, screaming)

38:55.701 --> 38:57.168
WARREN:
She can't find us
if we split up.

38:59.036 --> 39:00.639
You go that way.
JONATHAN:
Which way?

39:00.672 --> 39:02.340
WARREN:
That way. Over--
(grunts)

39:03.442 --> 39:06.077
BUFFY:
Just keep
talking, boys.

39:06.110 --> 39:09.880
(blows thudding)
JONATHAN: Ow! Ow, ow!
Watch the chest hair.

39:09.914 --> 39:12.418
(ray gun powering up)
BUFFY: I know that voice.
You-You're--

39:14.920 --> 39:17.588
Jonathan?
You have chest hair?

39:20.891 --> 39:21.893
Warren?

39:27.898 --> 39:32.070
-Who are you?
-Andrew.

39:32.103 --> 39:35.139
I summoned the flying monkeys
that attacked the high school.

39:41.579 --> 39:43.914
During the school play,
you know?

39:43.949 --> 39:45.684
He's Tucker's brother.
He's Tucker's
brother.

39:45.717 --> 39:47.652
-Oh.
-Oh.

39:50.088 --> 39:52.023
So you three
have, what,

39:52.056 --> 39:54.626
banded together
to be pains in my ass?

39:54.659 --> 39:58.864
We're your
arch "nemesises-ses."

39:58.896 --> 40:01.800
You may have beaten us
this time, Slayer,
but next time--

40:01.833 --> 40:04.168
Um, uh, next time--

40:05.471 --> 40:06.637
Maybe not!

40:08.974 --> 40:11.141
(door rattling)
WARREN: What do mean
it's locked?

40:11.175 --> 40:12.744
You were
supposed to check it.
ANDREW: I forgot.

40:14.646 --> 40:18.583
I give you my arch
"nemesises-ses."

40:18.617 --> 40:20.385
What's going on
in here?

40:20.418 --> 40:23.789
-I got a bunch of scared kids
saying this place is haunted.
-(door slams)

40:26.592 --> 40:30.061
Oh, my God. Buffy?
I know.
They're gone.

40:30.094 --> 40:34.199
I guess we should chase them.
No. Your hair--
it i adorable.

40:35.934 --> 40:38.436
(sighs)

40:38.469 --> 40:41.206
It's pretty neat,
you finding the van.

40:43.007 --> 40:46.478
So... how did you manage
to do it exactly?

40:46.512 --> 40:48.514
I mean,
to locate it.

40:48.547 --> 40:51.682
The hard way--
the spell-free way,

40:51.717 --> 40:55.152
the "Oh, my God,
my head's gonna fall off,

40:55.186 --> 40:57.454
my feet are killing me" way.

40:57.489 --> 41:00.858
(sighs)

41:04.730 --> 41:07.065
I don't know how
I got through this day.

41:09.067 --> 41:11.369
Well, the important thing
is that you did.

41:12.469 --> 41:14.539
It's a good first step.

41:16.507 --> 41:18.844
How are you doing,
post-invisibleness?

41:21.179 --> 41:23.280
Okay.

41:23.313 --> 41:26.751
I still have to do
some damage control
from my giddyfest.

41:27.818 --> 41:30.556
Dawn was pretty
freaked out.

41:30.588 --> 41:34.192
The whole "taking
a vacation from me" thing
didn't work out too well.

41:34.224 --> 41:36.193
Tell me about it.

41:39.164 --> 41:41.567
Except--

41:41.599 --> 41:43.835
When I got
Xander's message,
(acoustic guitar playing)

41:43.869 --> 41:46.436
you know, that I was...
fading away,

41:48.206 --> 41:50.007
I actually
got scared.

41:51.677 --> 41:53.679
Well, yeah.
Who wouldn't?

41:55.045 --> 41:56.380
Me.

41:57.414 --> 41:59.751
I wouldn't.

41:59.784 --> 42:02.721
Not too long ago,
I probably would
have welcomed it.

42:04.623 --> 42:05.956
But I realized--

42:07.693 --> 42:11.429
I'm not saying that
I'm doing backflips
about my life, but...

42:13.364 --> 42:14.431
I didn't--

42:15.601 --> 42:18.402
I don't...
wanna die.

42:20.471 --> 42:22.306
That's something,
right?

42:24.041 --> 42:25.911
That's something.

42:28.146 --> 42:33.083
(woman singing indistinctly)
So I guess we both
made good first steps.

42:34.885 --> 42:35.954
I guess.

42:38.222 --> 42:39.556
Yay for us.

42:40.592 --> 42:41.659
Yay.

43:17.461 --> 43:19.831
Grr! Arrgh!
