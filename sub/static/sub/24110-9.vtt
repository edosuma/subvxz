WEBVTT

00:01.523 --> 00:03.307
My name is Dylan Reinhart.
Not too long ago,

00:03.351 --> 00:06.571
I was an operative in the CIA
known as Agent Reinhart.

00:06.615 --> 00:08.530
When I left the Agency
and started teaching,

00:08.573 --> 00:09.922
I became Professor Reinhart.

00:09.966 --> 00:11.707
I wrote a book
about abnormal behavior

00:11.750 --> 00:14.057
and criminals,
which was so successful

00:14.101 --> 00:17.060
a serial killer used it
as clues for his murders.

00:17.104 --> 00:18.540
That's when the
New York Police Department

00:18.583 --> 00:20.411
reached out to me
to help catch him.

00:20.455 --> 00:22.239
Which I did, so they hired me,

00:22.283 --> 00:23.936
and I became
Consultant Reinhart.

00:23.980 --> 00:26.461
So now I'm working
with this woman,

00:26.504 --> 00:27.853
Detective Lizzie Needham

00:27.897 --> 00:30.030
of the homicide division,
catching killers.

00:30.073 --> 00:31.640
Looks like I need a new name.

00:31.683 --> 00:33.468
Don't they call you
Professor Psychopath?

00:39.778 --> 00:41.737
JOAN:
Sexy, edgy, risky.

00:41.780 --> 00:44.087
Do you know what I mean?
Tasty.

00:44.131 --> 00:45.393
Yeah, I'm confused.
Are you enthusing

00:45.436 --> 00:46.959
about your empanada,
or are you saying

00:47.003 --> 00:49.571
that a book about
consulting for the NYPD

00:49.614 --> 00:51.399
isn't tasty enough for you?

00:51.442 --> 00:54.228
No, I'm saying
that the public is fickle

00:54.271 --> 00:56.621
and these things
wax and wane.

00:56.665 --> 00:58.928
But the good news for you

00:58.971 --> 01:02.062
is there's a huge
appetite for spycraft.

01:02.105 --> 01:04.716
You do realize
I am no longer a spy.

01:04.760 --> 01:07.502
Yes, but with
your CIA background

01:07.545 --> 01:10.853
and me as your editor,
I could provoke

01:10.896 --> 01:13.725
a bidding war
for the movie rights

01:13.769 --> 01:16.641
just based on the title alone.

01:16.685 --> 01:19.601
So, my book, which I have not
written yet, has a title?

01:19.644 --> 01:20.602
Oh, yeah.

01:20.645 --> 01:22.517
Mm, what is it?

01:22.560 --> 01:24.127
Spy Brain.

01:24.171 --> 01:25.346
Not that I would
ever tell you

01:25.389 --> 01:26.956
what to write.Oh, no, except when you do.

01:26.999 --> 01:28.610
There's just one small hitch.

01:28.653 --> 01:30.438
Well, we'll get
the Agency's permission.

01:30.481 --> 01:35.138
Even if we could, I would
never divulge my CIA past.

01:35.182 --> 01:36.487
I still have former
assets in the field

01:36.531 --> 01:37.880
who might be identified

01:37.923 --> 01:39.795
and their lives put
in mortal danger.

01:39.838 --> 01:42.319
We'll just change the names.

02:04.733 --> 02:07.257
Looks like a bad day
for dogs everywhere.

02:08.954 --> 02:10.347
Gary has a blankie,

02:10.391 --> 02:12.654
a Tempur-Pedic bed,
ten toys,

02:12.697 --> 02:15.657
two tubs of finely chopped
organic chicken...

02:15.700 --> 02:17.485
What is that?

02:17.528 --> 02:19.704
His doggy GPS.

02:19.748 --> 02:22.881
I know, but it's not like he can
tell someone if he gets lost.

02:22.925 --> 02:24.318
Lizzie, he's here

02:24.361 --> 02:26.189
for a tooth pulling,
which is great news

02:26.233 --> 02:28.713
because it means the doctor
thinks he'll live long enough

02:28.757 --> 02:30.411
to need the rest of his teeth.

02:30.454 --> 02:31.890
So, isn't this overkill?

02:31.934 --> 02:33.414
No, this is overkill.

02:33.457 --> 02:34.850
That's a lot of forms
for a tooth-pulling.

02:34.893 --> 02:36.330
I know they have
to put him down first.

02:36.373 --> 02:37.940
Put him under.
Under.

02:37.983 --> 02:40.421
Right, right. But are you sure
that's all they want to do?

02:40.464 --> 02:42.727
The vet just needs my permission
to run a few tests

02:42.771 --> 02:44.338
before the procedure.I had my appendix burst

02:44.381 --> 02:46.209
in Tanzania once.
I had to be airlifted to Kenya.

02:46.253 --> 02:47.906
I didn't fill in
half as many forms as that.

02:47.950 --> 02:50.387
Did you forget you're here
for moral support?

02:50.431 --> 02:51.867
Right.Gary's old.

02:51.910 --> 02:53.216
I'm scared.

02:53.260 --> 02:54.609
Maybe just be quiet.

03:05.097 --> 03:07.012
:
It's funny.

03:07.056 --> 03:08.710
Studies claim that pet ownership

03:08.753 --> 03:10.494
reduces stress

03:10.538 --> 03:12.104
and helps fight depression,
yet here you are

03:12.148 --> 03:13.454
stressing out
about a tooth-pulling

03:13.497 --> 03:15.499
and depressed about
Gary's inevitable demise.

03:17.719 --> 03:19.634
We're ready for Gary.Oh.

03:19.677 --> 03:21.723
Hey, buddy.

03:24.247 --> 03:25.814
Oh. It's okay, Gary.

03:32.734 --> 03:35.215
Can you play
that video again?

03:37.782 --> 03:40.220
Check this out.

03:40.263 --> 03:42.004
Keep your eye on the beagle.
It's disturbing.

03:42.047 --> 03:45.660
He's cramping,
seizing up with pain.

03:45.703 --> 03:48.445
And look at that motion he's
making with his left paw.

03:48.489 --> 03:51.187
I think he's injecting
epinephrine into his thigh.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.319
This beagle wasn't

03:52.362 --> 03:53.668
having an allergic reaction

03:53.711 --> 03:55.191
to that kid's peanuts.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.672
He was in trouble
long before that.

03:59.804 --> 04:02.590
EMS arrived to find
the poor guy unresponsive.

04:02.633 --> 04:03.895
They did a scoop-and-run,

04:03.939 --> 04:05.245
intubated him,
administered ACLS,

04:05.288 --> 04:06.594
but they couldn't revive him.

04:06.637 --> 04:08.291
What was his cause of death?

04:08.335 --> 04:10.380
Cardiac arrest
due to anaphylactic shock

04:10.424 --> 04:12.817
brought on by a severe
allergic reaction to peanuts.

04:12.861 --> 04:14.341
It's tragic but not uncommon.

04:14.384 --> 04:15.777
Where's his costume?

04:15.820 --> 04:18.214
And why was the epinephrine
injection not effective?

04:18.258 --> 04:19.694
He had one?

04:19.737 --> 04:21.217
Oh, yeah.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.914
Let me see.

04:24.525 --> 04:27.223
There's a small puncture site
on his thigh.

04:27.267 --> 04:30.052
DYLAN:
So the needle
pierced the fur

04:30.095 --> 04:33.098
and his skin, but didn't
counteract the peanuts.

04:33.142 --> 04:34.796
LIZZIE: Maybe it
was sabotaged.

04:34.839 --> 04:36.145
We're gonna need to take this

04:36.188 --> 04:37.494
and have it tested.Of course.

04:43.587 --> 04:45.285
What is that?

04:49.201 --> 04:51.639
A highly concentrated
peanut compound.

04:51.682 --> 04:54.337
Surprisingly odor-free.

04:54.381 --> 04:55.947
How can you possibly know that?

04:55.991 --> 04:57.819
Because I, too...

04:57.862 --> 04:59.516
have a peanut allergy.

05:07.045 --> 05:09.874
This man didn't die
from an allergy.

05:09.918 --> 05:12.050
He was murdered by one.

05:15.140 --> 05:17.404
â™ª

05:28.240 --> 05:30.373
LIZZIE: We need to secure the
crime scene, collect evidence

05:30.417 --> 05:33.333
and retrace Gavin's steps
leading up to his murder.

05:36.031 --> 05:38.773
You can't do this.
We have a show in 20 minutes.

05:38.816 --> 05:41.123
Look at the line.
Ticket sales have quadrupled.

05:41.166 --> 05:43.473
I can't believe
Gavin's dead.

05:43.517 --> 05:44.996
He was such
a sweet guy.

05:45.040 --> 05:47.347
We can't let
all those kids down.

05:47.390 --> 05:49.174
I'm sorry you won't
be able to exploit

05:49.218 --> 05:51.742
Bagel's untimely death,
but we have a homicide

05:51.786 --> 05:53.178
to investigate.Homicide?

05:53.222 --> 05:54.876
Gavin's death was no accident.
Someone killed him.

05:54.919 --> 05:57.574
How is it murder?
He had a peanut allergy.

05:57.618 --> 05:59.228
Are

05:59.271 --> 06:00.751
We have no reason
to believe so,

06:00.795 --> 06:02.274
but we're just starting
our investigation.

06:02.318 --> 06:03.928
Where was Gavin's
costume kept, and who had

06:03.972 --> 06:05.408
access to it
when he wasn't wearing it?

06:05.452 --> 06:07.454
He always brought
his costume home.

06:07.497 --> 06:09.760
Listen, I really gotta
get this show started.

06:09.804 --> 06:11.545
Let's roll out, guys.LIZZIE: Hey, hey, hey.

06:11.588 --> 06:13.938
Everyone needs to stay
to be questioned.

06:15.244 --> 06:17.202
Gavin was a mentor,

06:17.246 --> 06:18.943
an inspiration to me.

06:18.987 --> 06:21.816
Uh, he was giving,
he was loving,

06:21.859 --> 06:23.731
he was affectionate.

06:23.774 --> 06:26.386
Why would anyone want
to murder him?

06:26.429 --> 06:30.651
Gavin brought something special
to Bagel's character.

06:30.694 --> 06:32.479
Kids responded to him.

06:32.522 --> 06:35.046
MAN:
Gavin was like a brother to me.

06:35.090 --> 06:37.527
We had a great connection.

06:37.571 --> 06:40.443
Both on and offstage.

06:40.487 --> 06:42.750
WOMAN:
Gavin was universally loved

06:42.793 --> 06:45.274
and adored by everyone.

06:45.317 --> 06:48.320
Theater has lost a great talent.

06:50.279 --> 06:51.715
Gavin was a douchebag.

06:51.759 --> 06:54.370
Don't get me wrong,
I feel bad for the guy.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.851
But he was banging Selma
even though he was dating Mindy,

06:56.894 --> 06:59.767
which pissed her off and made
Solly completely jealous

06:59.810 --> 07:01.682
because he kind of has
a thing for Selma.

07:01.725 --> 07:03.292
Yeah, Gavin was a mooch.

07:03.335 --> 07:05.381
I think he owed Hector
like a grand,

07:05.425 --> 07:06.774
which he never paid back.

07:06.817 --> 07:08.950
And even though
he had a nothing career,

07:08.993 --> 07:12.257
he was always bragging about
some B-movie he shot in Morocco,

07:12.301 --> 07:14.129
which I don't think
even got released.

07:16.784 --> 07:19.526
We have five people who felt
some level of contempt

07:19.569 --> 07:22.311
toward Gavin, just from
this recent production alone.

07:22.354 --> 07:24.226
I'd eliminate Hector.

07:24.269 --> 07:28.273
Clearly, he resented Gavin but
also had empathy towards him.

07:28.317 --> 07:30.624
Otherwise, he wouldn't have lent
him money in the first place.

07:30.667 --> 07:33.322
LIZZIE: And by killing him,
he'd never get his money back.

07:33.365 --> 07:35.063
I'd eliminate Solly.
Gavin was helping make

07:35.106 --> 07:36.412
his production successful.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.980
True, and Solly's desire
for Selma

07:39.023 --> 07:40.503
was more wishful than real.

07:40.547 --> 07:43.027
What about Dina?
She didn't have a problem

07:43.071 --> 07:44.420
pointing a finger
towards everyone else.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.335
Yeah, but she also pointed
a finger at herself.

07:46.378 --> 07:48.337
Not to mention she was right
on all accounts.

07:48.380 --> 07:50.557
Her story checked out.

07:50.600 --> 07:52.167
Selma was oddly dispassionate,

07:52.210 --> 07:54.299
which could be the trait
of a killer,

07:54.343 --> 07:56.171
but her motive
is the most dubious.

07:56.214 --> 07:58.521
Which leaves Mindy,
who doesn't exactly

07:58.565 --> 08:00.175
strike me as a peanut chemist.

08:00.218 --> 08:01.742
Well, that was efficient.

08:01.785 --> 08:04.179
We managed to eliminate
the five potential suspects

08:04.222 --> 08:05.659
in, oh, under 30 seconds.

08:05.702 --> 08:08.488
Hey, hey.
Having a barbecue this weekend.

08:08.531 --> 08:10.011
I would have
sent an e-mail,

08:10.054 --> 08:13.231
but I couldn't get the thing
to work, so I printed them.

08:13.275 --> 08:15.582
Why does it look like
a serial killer made these?

08:15.625 --> 08:17.801
Yeah, I couldn't figure out
how to delete the shoe.

08:17.845 --> 08:20.282
What home upgrade
you showing off this time?

08:20.325 --> 08:21.979
We just put in
some sweet new hardscaping.

08:23.154 --> 08:24.329
You know, patio,

08:24.373 --> 08:26.157
outdoor kitchen,
the whole shebang.

08:26.201 --> 08:28.638
You should bring your, um...
you know, your, uh...

08:28.682 --> 08:31.641
your guy, your, uh,

08:31.685 --> 08:33.687
domestic whatever.

08:36.385 --> 08:37.691
You mean my husband?

08:37.734 --> 08:39.083
Yeah. Yeah.

08:39.127 --> 08:40.563
Great.

08:40.607 --> 08:43.305
I look forward to meeting
your domestic whatever.

08:47.439 --> 08:48.528
You're one
of those people

08:48.571 --> 08:50.181
that says you're
definitely gonna come

08:50.225 --> 08:52.662
but have no intentions
of actually going, aren't you?

08:52.706 --> 08:55.317
Yes.ZACK: Tox labs came back.

08:55.360 --> 08:58.276
Gavin's injector was not
filled with epinephrine,

08:58.320 --> 08:59.582
but with saline solution.

08:59.626 --> 09:01.845
The sample taken from
inside Bagel's head

09:01.889 --> 09:06.937
is a highly concentrated
extract of... Arachis hypogaea.

09:06.981 --> 09:08.678
Otherwise known as peanut.

09:08.722 --> 09:10.288
LIZZIE:
Somehow made odorless

09:10.332 --> 09:11.681
so Gavin wouldn't suspect.

09:11.725 --> 09:13.074
Good for him.

09:13.117 --> 09:15.250
Not Gavin, obviously,
but the killer,

09:15.293 --> 09:17.382
who is much more sophisticated
than I first thought.

09:17.426 --> 09:22.083
He-- or she-- weaponized
peanut extract.

09:22.126 --> 09:24.607
Or at least had
access to it.

09:28.089 --> 09:29.481
Oh.

09:35.444 --> 09:37.098
Epinephrine.

09:38.273 --> 09:39.970
Look at these.

09:40.014 --> 09:41.624
Oh, we need to bag
and tag those.

09:48.326 --> 09:51.112
Looks like Gavin
was a bit of a Luddite.

09:51.155 --> 09:54.289
Or else he couldn't afford
to keep up

09:54.332 --> 09:56.291
with the pace
of modern technology.

09:57.466 --> 09:59.076
Ooh!
Oh, my God.

09:59.120 --> 10:01.601
Certainly lives up to the
image of a starving artist.

10:01.644 --> 10:03.603
I'd say it was
extremely unlikely

10:03.646 --> 10:05.343
he ever entertained here.

10:05.387 --> 10:06.954
His killer knew him well enough

10:06.997 --> 10:08.956
to know that he had
a peanut allergy.

10:08.999 --> 10:11.828
Maybe it was someone
from his past?

10:11.872 --> 10:13.917
Another struggling actor?

10:13.961 --> 10:15.484
He certainly was struggling.

10:15.527 --> 10:17.181
Haven't seen one of these
since the '90s.

10:18.792 --> 10:20.315
:
This is Larry.

10:20.358 --> 10:22.622
Did you get my last message?
Call me.

10:24.145 --> 10:25.537
LARRY:
Stop avoiding me, Gavin.

10:25.581 --> 10:27.148
We need to meet.

10:27.191 --> 10:29.933
There could be serious
implications if you ignore this.

10:29.977 --> 10:31.935
LARRY: What do I have to do?

10:31.979 --> 10:34.329
Hunt you down?
I know you're a fancy actor now

10:34.372 --> 10:36.200
with a steady gig,
but we have to meet.

10:36.244 --> 10:39.290
Call me before it's too late.We can match up

10:39.334 --> 10:41.815
the time stamp on
the voice mail, I.D. this guy.

10:41.858 --> 10:44.121
But even if this Larry
guy is our killer,

10:44.165 --> 10:45.775
how would he get a
hold of something

10:45.819 --> 10:50.301
as exotic as weaponized
peanut extract?

10:50.345 --> 10:52.173
Weaponized peanut extract?

10:52.216 --> 10:54.131
Sounds like something
Saddam Hussein

10:54.175 --> 10:56.177
would have served to an in-law.
Never heard of it.

10:56.220 --> 10:57.874
Odorless, highly concentrated,

10:57.918 --> 10:58.875
extremely lethal.

10:58.919 --> 11:00.529
Who was the victim?

11:00.572 --> 11:02.139
An obscure actor who played

11:02.183 --> 11:04.359
a plushy canine
at a kiddie theater.

11:04.402 --> 11:06.622
No wonder you left
the boring old CIA

11:06.666 --> 11:08.624
for the thrill and intrigue
of the NYPD.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.626
And you left it for what?

11:10.670 --> 11:12.889
Come work with me,
and you can find out.

11:12.933 --> 11:16.414
I'll see what I can find on
purveyors of your peanut weapon.

11:16.458 --> 11:18.808
Thank you, and good-bye, Julian.

11:30.820 --> 11:33.344
:
Oh! Sorry.

11:33.388 --> 11:35.129
That was meant for the trash.

11:35.172 --> 11:37.044
What is this?Ah, some coworker

11:37.087 --> 11:39.263
invited us to a barbecue.
Don't worry, we're not going.

11:39.307 --> 11:41.744
What
I would love to go.

11:41.788 --> 11:44.573
You have never included
me in your work life.

11:44.616 --> 11:47.228
When you were working
for the CIA...

11:47.271 --> 11:49.230
I couldn't.
Or in your work
as an author.

11:49.273 --> 11:51.232
You want to sit
and watch me type?

11:51.275 --> 11:53.016
With your teaching.You want to hobnob

11:53.060 --> 11:54.496
with some pimple

11:54.539 --> 11:56.280
Look, we both know
you're more comfortable

11:56.324 --> 11:57.717
keeping your life...

11:57.760 --> 11:59.457
compartmentalized.

11:59.501 --> 12:02.112
Oh.

12:02.156 --> 12:05.986
I suppose it stems
from my life in the Agency.

12:06.029 --> 12:09.772
It was dangerous to mix
personal with professional.

12:09.816 --> 12:10.860
Think it might go back further.

12:10.904 --> 12:12.383
To your childhood.

12:12.427 --> 12:14.211
When you kept your
world private.

12:14.255 --> 12:18.259
You know, maybe because
of your musical gift.

12:19.782 --> 12:22.742
Or being gay, your
father's disapproval.

12:22.785 --> 12:26.006
It is time for you to
come out of your shell.

12:26.049 --> 12:27.398
Okay, it'll be fun.

12:27.442 --> 12:29.009
I'll keep an eye on you.

12:29.052 --> 12:31.098
You really want to go?

12:32.316 --> 12:34.231
I thought you would never ask.

12:38.061 --> 12:39.584
This is Dr. Reinhart.

12:39.628 --> 12:41.282
Gavin set a lunch meeting

12:41.325 --> 12:44.067
with the suspicious caller
on his answering machine

12:44.111 --> 12:45.634
a few days
before he was murdered.

12:45.677 --> 12:46.809
Did you I.D. him?

12:46.853 --> 12:48.376
Larry Greenspan.

12:48.419 --> 12:49.812
Tax accountant.

12:49.856 --> 12:51.771
Lives in Yonkers.

12:53.816 --> 12:55.557
WOMAN:
You looking for Larry?

12:55.600 --> 12:58.081
Do you know
where we can find him?

12:58.125 --> 13:00.040
Mount Eden Cemetery.

13:00.083 --> 13:02.782
Larry died of a heart attack
couple of days ago.

13:02.825 --> 13:04.827
Funeral is today.

13:06.394 --> 13:09.092
So I guess Larry
is not our killer.

13:09.136 --> 13:11.921
What if he's
another victim?

13:13.488 --> 13:15.838
If Larry was murdered
by Gavin's killer,

13:15.882 --> 13:18.841
we're looking for a
similar kind of sabotage.

13:18.885 --> 13:20.930
Oh, I don't feel right
about this.

13:20.974 --> 13:22.236
About what?

13:22.279 --> 13:24.412
About saying,
"Oh, sorry for your loss,

13:24.455 --> 13:26.283
"but we're gonna have
to haul your friend away

13:26.327 --> 13:28.590
so we can see if he was iced
by Mr. Peanut."

13:28.633 --> 13:30.026
Let's just wait
till they all leave.

13:30.070 --> 13:31.549
I mean, how long
can that take?

13:31.593 --> 13:32.681
There's, like,
seven people here.

13:32.724 --> 13:35.336
...honor to our departed Larry.

13:35.379 --> 13:39.470
It is difficult to say good-bye
to a friend and a loved one.

13:39.514 --> 13:43.431
Larry loved to give back
to the community.

13:43.474 --> 13:47.783
Nothing gave him greater joy
than his volunteer work

13:47.827 --> 13:50.525
teaching acting
at the community playhouse.

13:50.568 --> 13:52.353
Another actor.

13:52.396 --> 13:54.964
Larry felt passionate
about the theater,

13:55.008 --> 13:57.880
which is probably why he came
to be regarded

13:57.924 --> 14:01.579
as one of the country's foremost
volunteer acting teachers.

14:01.623 --> 14:03.233
"Foremost volunteer
acting teachers?"

14:03.277 --> 14:04.582
Oh, please.
Shh.

14:04.626 --> 14:06.106
Acting was his drug.

14:06.149 --> 14:07.847
Larry never drank.

14:07.890 --> 14:09.587
He never swore.

14:09.631 --> 14:12.242
His only vice
was the occasional cigarette

14:12.286 --> 14:14.244
he allowed himself
after a long day...

14:14.288 --> 14:15.942
Think his cigs could've
been sabotaged?

14:15.985 --> 14:18.814
We should get our hands
on his last pack.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.860
Rest in peace, Lawrence.

14:26.387 --> 14:29.869
We'll order an advanced
tox screening on his blood.

14:30.913 --> 14:32.523
Detective Needham, NYPD.

14:32.567 --> 14:35.265
We have reason to believe that
Mr. Greenspan was the victim

14:35.309 --> 14:36.963
of a homicide, and...

14:37.006 --> 14:38.573
We need his body.

14:44.274 --> 14:47.277
It'll be fine. Trust me.
And Lizzie will be there, right?

14:47.321 --> 14:50.411
Yeah, but I just...
I hate chitchat.

14:50.454 --> 14:52.108
It's normal human interaction.

14:52.152 --> 14:53.936
You know, the simple stuff.

14:53.980 --> 14:55.982
It's not really the chitchat
you're worried about, is it?

14:56.025 --> 14:58.898
It's the cross-pollination
of the worker species

14:58.941 --> 15:00.638
with the domestic species.

15:00.682 --> 15:01.901
Don't worry, okay?

15:01.944 --> 15:03.903
We'll, uh, cross-pollinate.

15:03.946 --> 15:05.600
We'll make a little honey.
It'll be sweet.

15:05.643 --> 15:07.254
Honey?
Exactly.

15:07.297 --> 15:09.517
What is inside
there, by the way?Calvados.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.475
: You bought
a bottle of brandy?Mm-hmm.

15:11.519 --> 15:13.390
Give me a sec.

15:17.655 --> 15:19.222
Hi, guys.

15:19.266 --> 15:21.094
Hey!How you doing?

15:21.137 --> 15:22.356
Hey, Anthony.
Thanks for having us.Of course.

15:22.399 --> 15:23.748
This is my husband, Andy.

15:23.792 --> 15:25.533
What, did you bring
the entire bar?

15:25.576 --> 15:26.621
I love him already.

15:26.664 --> 15:27.970
Great. Thanks.

15:28.014 --> 15:30.233
All right, well, look,
make yourself at home.

15:30.277 --> 15:31.321
Here you go.

15:31.365 --> 15:33.584
Eat, drink,

15:33.628 --> 15:34.934
meet the friends
and fam.

15:34.977 --> 15:37.762
Where's Lizzie?ZACK: Oh, she couldn't make it.

15:37.806 --> 15:39.590
She had to pick up Gary
from the vet.

15:39.634 --> 15:40.287
ANDY:
Aw, I was hoping

15:40.330 --> 15:41.288
to hang out with her.

15:41.331 --> 15:42.637
Me, too.Sure she's not trying

15:42.680 --> 15:43.986
to track down your
deadly peanut butter killer?

15:45.248 --> 15:46.380
FUCCI:
Hey, don't worry.

15:46.423 --> 15:47.685
We've already got two units

15:47.729 --> 15:48.817
staking out
Colonel Mustard's place.

15:50.688 --> 15:52.299
Doc, come on.
Let me introduce you around.

15:52.342 --> 15:54.344
Fuccis love to chitchat.

15:54.388 --> 15:55.998
Come here.

16:00.742 --> 16:01.699
Hey.

16:01.743 --> 16:02.962
DYLAN:
Hey.

16:03.005 --> 16:04.920
You at Fucci's barbecue?Yeah.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.314
I wish I was there.So do I.

16:07.357 --> 16:09.620
Andy seems to be
fitting right in,

16:09.664 --> 16:11.753
but I can't stop thinking
about our victims.

16:11.796 --> 16:14.103
Me, too. I've been looking
for an acting connection

16:14.147 --> 16:16.453
between Gavin and Greenspan.
Not finding anything.

16:16.497 --> 16:18.847
You think Gavin could have taken
Greenspan's class?

16:18.890 --> 16:20.283
I got a hold of the rosters

16:20.327 --> 16:22.024
from the last four years.
Nothing there.

16:22.068 --> 16:24.418
Anything from the M.E.?
Tox lab?

16:24.461 --> 16:26.246
Not for at least another hour.

16:26.289 --> 16:27.334
Oh, I-I gotta go.

16:27.377 --> 16:28.857
I'll-I'll keep you posted.

16:28.900 --> 16:31.251
Hi. I missed two calls
from the vet.

16:31.294 --> 16:32.687
Uh, is Gary okay?

16:32.730 --> 16:34.471
Um...

16:34.515 --> 16:37.126
What

16:37.170 --> 16:39.607
I'm not allowed
to release any information.

16:39.650 --> 16:41.174
You should hear from the doctor.

16:41.217 --> 16:43.002
She'll be done in
a couple minutes.

16:55.057 --> 16:57.190
Gary!

16:57.233 --> 16:59.366
Whoa, that's authorized
personnel only.

16:59.409 --> 17:00.541
I'm authorized.

17:02.108 --> 17:03.935
Gary?

17:06.025 --> 17:07.243
Gary?

17:10.116 --> 17:12.074
Oh! Hey. You're alive.

17:12.118 --> 17:14.250
Yes, of course
he's alive.
Hey, buddy.

17:14.294 --> 17:16.731
I tried to call you.
We had to pull a second tooth,

17:16.774 --> 17:18.385
which cost
an additional 600.

17:18.428 --> 17:19.734
Okay. Thank you.

17:19.777 --> 17:21.823
Come on. Let's go, let's go.

17:21.866 --> 17:23.564
Hey, Andy, how'd
you make the jump

17:23.607 --> 17:25.305
from lawyer to pub owner?

17:25.348 --> 17:26.567
Well, after I passed the bar,

17:26.610 --> 17:28.090
I turned right around
and bought it.

17:28.134 --> 17:30.397
ANDY: All right, there we go.

17:30.440 --> 17:32.225
To Andy!OTHERS: To Andy!

17:32.268 --> 17:33.661
All right.

17:34.705 --> 17:36.142
FUCCI:
Mmm.

17:36.185 --> 17:37.404
Oh, yeah,
pour some out

17:37.447 --> 17:38.492
for these guys.ANDY: All right.

17:38.535 --> 17:39.580
Yeah, sure.
Who wants one?

17:45.673 --> 17:47.283
I hate these things. You?

17:48.328 --> 17:49.459
Maria Fucci.

17:49.503 --> 17:50.634
Hello. My name is...

17:50.678 --> 17:52.114
Yeah, I know
who you are.

17:52.158 --> 17:53.420
You're married
to the know-it-all who's

17:53.463 --> 17:55.335
partnered with Lizzie.
That fellow over there?

17:55.378 --> 17:57.685
Better-looking
than I expected.

17:57.728 --> 18:02.342
Looks like your hubby and
Anthony are becoming fast pals.

18:02.385 --> 18:05.258
Like two tiny cannibals
in a fat guy's rib cage.

18:06.694 --> 18:08.261
"Like two tiny cannibals
in a fat guy's rib cage."

18:08.304 --> 18:09.914
I like that analogy.

18:09.958 --> 18:11.438
Oh, yeah, use it anytime.

18:11.481 --> 18:13.918
Anthony loves throwing
these things.

18:13.962 --> 18:15.442
'Cause they're his buddies.

18:15.485 --> 18:17.052
Plus Anthony loves mangling.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.141
You mean mingling?

18:19.185 --> 18:21.578
Mangling. Like, shmooshing
his people together.

18:21.622 --> 18:24.146
Work and personal.

18:24.190 --> 18:26.714
It takes effort, you know,

18:26.757 --> 18:29.456
to play with people
you don't know.

18:29.499 --> 18:31.849
When you love someone,
you make the effort.

18:36.289 --> 18:37.986
What do you say,
Maria?

18:38.029 --> 18:39.683
Shall we make the effort?

18:39.727 --> 18:41.772
Why not?

18:43.034 --> 18:44.862
Okay, but you serve first.

18:44.906 --> 18:47.648
Oh, you can change into
your suit over there.

18:47.691 --> 18:49.302
Oh...LIZZIE: Detective Fucci,
that's some neat hardscaping.

18:49.345 --> 18:51.130
FUCCI: Hey!Your first-grade salary
cover that?

18:51.173 --> 18:53.132
Excuse me, Maria.

18:54.524 --> 18:55.786
He's a good boy.
Oh, oh. Hey.

18:55.830 --> 18:58.180
He's a very good boy.How is the patient?

18:58.224 --> 18:59.660
LIZZIE:
Alive, thank God.

18:59.703 --> 19:01.879
We can't stay long.
I just came to pick you up.

19:01.923 --> 19:03.490
Results from the M.E.
are coming in.

19:03.533 --> 19:04.969
FUCCI: Oh, how
is the retiree?

19:05.013 --> 19:07.233
You know that Gary
was one of the best

19:07.276 --> 19:08.973
drug-sniffing pooches
in the business.

19:16.372 --> 19:18.331
What?

19:21.029 --> 19:22.857
DYLAN:
There you go.

19:22.900 --> 19:25.381
Fresh from the M.E.

19:25.425 --> 19:27.731
He found black and
brown particles

19:27.775 --> 19:30.081
in the alveolar
scavenger cells.

19:30.125 --> 19:31.431
Smoker's lung.

19:31.474 --> 19:34.216
Larry smoked more
than his rabbi thought.

19:34.260 --> 19:36.000
Which brings us
to the advanced

19:36.044 --> 19:37.872
tox screen findings
we requested.

19:37.915 --> 19:39.439
Fentanyl.

19:39.482 --> 19:42.964
An opioid pain medication
and recreational drug.

19:43.007 --> 19:45.271
The concentration found
in his pack of cigarettes

19:45.314 --> 19:47.229
did not suggest
fun and games.

19:47.273 --> 19:48.491
It was a lethal dose.

19:48.535 --> 19:50.450
So Larry did not die
of a heart attack.

19:50.493 --> 19:51.625
Just like Gavin
didn't die

19:51.668 --> 19:52.974
of an allergic reaction

19:53.017 --> 19:54.541
even though it appeared
that both men

19:54.584 --> 19:56.847
supposedly died
of natural causes.

19:56.891 --> 19:58.240
And their deaths were also aided

19:58.284 --> 19:59.981
by the use
of easy-to-acquire items--

20:00.024 --> 20:03.071
epinephrine and a cigarette--
things not easily traced.

20:03.114 --> 20:05.204
So we're looking
for a serial killer

20:05.247 --> 20:07.771
who knows his victims well
and is, what, a chemist?

20:07.815 --> 20:09.773
One who has a grudge
against unknown actors?

20:09.817 --> 20:10.992
Maybe.

20:11.035 --> 20:12.820
But why such elaborate methods?

20:12.863 --> 20:15.257
This killer is more dramatic
than his thespian victims.

20:15.301 --> 20:18.217
Something's out of proportion.

20:27.008 --> 20:29.140
:
Oh, no, just...

20:29.184 --> 20:31.012
making some notes.

20:45.069 --> 20:46.767
So, now you're stalking me?

20:46.810 --> 20:48.551
And you
are avoiding me.

20:48.595 --> 20:50.858
Didn't you get my message
about the second victim?

20:50.901 --> 20:54.122
His cigarette
was spiked with fentanyl.

20:54.165 --> 20:57.212
Doesn't that remind you
of Romania in '98?

20:58.822 --> 21:00.737
Is the CIA involved?

21:00.781 --> 21:01.956
Can't help you.

21:01.999 --> 21:03.653
I have no information.

21:03.697 --> 21:06.352
You never say you have
no information about anything.

21:08.049 --> 21:09.877
If the Company is...

21:09.920 --> 21:12.053
I suggest that you
and anyone you care about

21:12.096 --> 21:13.968
stay away from this.

21:18.146 --> 21:20.061
Thank you.

21:20.104 --> 21:21.976
You just gave me
everything I need to know.

21:23.325 --> 21:25.371
We are not looking
for a serial killer.

21:25.414 --> 21:28.112
We are looking
for an assassin.

21:36.643 --> 21:39.123
LIZZIE:
Okay. Thank you.

21:39.167 --> 21:41.604
Mm... no, I don't know

21:41.648 --> 21:43.780
if that kind of enlargement
is tax deductible.

21:43.824 --> 21:45.565
Thank you.

21:45.608 --> 21:48.611
I've talked
to a dozen people

21:48.655 --> 21:49.786
on Larry Greenspan's
phone bill.

21:49.830 --> 21:51.397
Half of them
were tax clients

21:51.440 --> 21:53.616
wondering if they still have
to pay what they owe to him.

21:53.660 --> 21:56.097
None of them
know anything.

21:56.140 --> 21:58.447
I called you last night.
I didn't leave a message.

21:58.491 --> 22:00.231
I saw that.

22:00.275 --> 22:02.451
Sorry, I should've
called you back.It's okay.

22:02.495 --> 22:04.323
I'm sorry I called you
a jackass.

22:04.366 --> 22:07.064
You didn't call me a jackass.In my head, I did.

22:07.108 --> 22:09.371
Hi. This is
Detective Needham, NYPD.

22:09.415 --> 22:10.677
We're investigating
the homicide

22:10.720 --> 22:12.505
of a man named
Larry Greenspan.

22:12.548 --> 22:14.202
Does that ring
a bell for you?

22:17.379 --> 22:18.380
That'd be great. Thanks.

22:24.212 --> 22:27.520
Yeah, uh...
do you recall their names

22:27.563 --> 22:29.217
or what they
look like or...?

22:30.261 --> 22:31.480
Oh, fantastic.

22:31.524 --> 22:33.482
Oh. Could you
send me a...

22:33.526 --> 22:34.788
a copy of that
receipt, please?

22:36.224 --> 22:38.531
Thank you.

22:38.574 --> 22:40.881
What's the connection?

22:40.924 --> 22:42.361
Looking for military records

22:42.404 --> 22:43.536
for Gavin
and Greenspan?

22:43.579 --> 22:45.276
What's your theory?

22:45.320 --> 22:48.497
I'm just poking around,
trying to find a connection

22:48.541 --> 22:50.412
between the victims
other than acting.

22:50.456 --> 22:53.415
Hmm.It was a dead end.

22:53.459 --> 22:55.112
What do you got?

22:55.156 --> 22:57.201
That was a restaurant
where Greenspan

22:57.245 --> 22:59.508
was supposed to meet
with Gavin Carson.

22:59.552 --> 23:01.684
But Greenspan didn't show up
because he was dead.

23:01.728 --> 23:02.859
They just told me
the reservation

23:02.903 --> 23:04.078
was for three; two showed up.

23:04.121 --> 23:05.906
Gavin and...?A woman, about 30.

23:05.949 --> 23:07.690
Brown hair. She paid.Not a lot to go on,

23:07.734 --> 23:09.083
unless we can get a copy

23:09.126 --> 23:10.301
of her credit card receipt.

23:10.345 --> 23:11.433
Mm. Here it is.

23:11.477 --> 23:14.915
Her name is Nancy Millhouse.

23:14.958 --> 23:16.786
Two L's.

23:16.830 --> 23:19.702
Well, I have a Nancy Millhouse.

23:19.746 --> 23:21.878
She's a dental hygienist--
nothing to do with acting.

23:21.922 --> 23:24.228
Got her address
and phone number.

23:26.492 --> 23:29.408
Hi. Is Nancy Millhouse there?

23:29.451 --> 23:30.800
When did she get ill?

23:31.758 --> 23:33.977
Sir, this is
Detective Needham, NYPD.

23:34.021 --> 23:36.284
Please don't give her
any more of her medications.

23:36.327 --> 23:37.894
There's a chance
they've been tampered with.

23:37.938 --> 23:39.287
We'll be there soon.

23:39.330 --> 23:40.331
Okay, bye.

23:40.375 --> 23:42.682
Nancy Millhouse is a diabetic.

23:42.725 --> 23:46.816
Gave herself an insulin shot,
started feeling worse.

23:46.860 --> 23:48.296
MAN:
She's severely
hypoglycemic.

23:48.339 --> 23:49.645
Someone must have spiked
Nancy's insulin.

23:49.689 --> 23:51.255
Do you have Glucagon on the bus?

23:51.299 --> 23:52.605
Yes. You a doctor?

23:52.648 --> 23:53.823
Yes.

23:53.867 --> 23:55.434
This is her insulin
and her Glucagon,

23:55.477 --> 23:57.697
but I didn't give her any
after I got your warning.

23:57.740 --> 23:59.829
Great. Can we bag those, please?Yeah.

23:59.873 --> 24:03.137
Um, do you or Nancy know

24:03.180 --> 24:06.053
Gavin Carson
or Larry Greenspan?

24:06.096 --> 24:07.707
No, I don't
recognize them.

24:07.750 --> 24:09.143
Did Nancy work
for the government?

24:09.186 --> 24:11.711
No.
Is Nancy an actor?

24:11.754 --> 24:13.103
Uh, she gave it up
three years ago.

24:13.147 --> 24:14.322
She's a dental
hygienist.

24:14.365 --> 24:15.410
That's how we met.

24:15.454 --> 24:16.455
Why did she give it up?

24:16.498 --> 24:17.804
She quit after she got
a parasite

24:17.847 --> 24:19.588
when she was shooting
some low-budget feature.

24:19.632 --> 24:21.285
Where was it shot?

24:21.329 --> 24:22.548
Morocco, I think.

24:22.591 --> 24:23.723
EMT: Her vitals
are stabilizing.

24:23.766 --> 24:24.854
We're ready to take
her to the hospital.

24:24.898 --> 24:25.942
I'm sorry.
I've gotta go.

24:25.986 --> 24:27.509
Thank you.

24:27.553 --> 24:29.642
You remember the picture
in Gavin's apartment?

24:29.685 --> 24:30.947
Mm-hmm. It was
taken in Morocco.

24:30.991 --> 24:32.862
We need to see if Greenspan

24:32.906 --> 24:35.125
went to Morocco, too, and
we need to find everyone

24:35.169 --> 24:37.606
who appeared in that film.
They could all be in danger.

24:37.650 --> 24:40.087
Why target actors?That's what we need
to figure out.

24:40.130 --> 24:42.306
I'm gonna take the evidence
to the lab.

24:42.350 --> 24:44.613
I'll meet you at the precinct.Okay.

24:50.880 --> 24:52.360
What are you doing?

24:54.231 --> 24:55.494
What do you know?

24:55.537 --> 24:56.843
What do you mean?

24:58.192 --> 24:59.585
You're looking
for foreign connections.

24:59.628 --> 25:01.456
You ask if she works
for the government.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.676
You knew this case
had some kind

25:03.719 --> 25:06.330
of international component
before we heard about Morocco.

25:06.374 --> 25:08.463
You know things you're
not telling me.

25:08.507 --> 25:11.118
I don't care about your
super special, secret friend,

25:11.161 --> 25:12.946
but these are my cases.

25:12.989 --> 25:14.687
I need to know
what you know.

25:14.730 --> 25:16.123
Right now,
we need to identify

25:16.166 --> 25:18.125
everyone who went to Morocco
to make that film,

25:18.168 --> 25:19.779
before another
of them is killed.

25:19.822 --> 25:22.216
Everything else has to wait.

25:22.259 --> 25:24.044
I'm sorry.

25:33.793 --> 25:35.446
So, why the Bat

25:35.490 --> 25:37.187
We have another victim.

25:37.231 --> 25:39.233
I should have known you
wouldn't stay away from this.

25:39.276 --> 25:40.582
We may have gotten
to her in time.

25:40.626 --> 25:41.714
Then you've
probably just driven

25:41.757 --> 25:43.150
whoever it is
further underground.

25:43.193 --> 25:44.586
"Whoever"?

25:44.630 --> 25:46.545
You don't know?

25:46.588 --> 25:49.025
How far have you gotten?

25:49.069 --> 25:51.201
We know all the
victims were actors

25:51.245 --> 25:53.203
who took part in the
same low-budget film

25:53.247 --> 25:54.901
shot in Morocco
a few years ago.

25:54.944 --> 25:56.859
But I think
that's a cover--

25:56.903 --> 25:59.166
at least what the
actors were told--

25:59.209 --> 26:02.212
and actually the film
was a propaganda tool

26:02.256 --> 26:04.432
to further some political
or corporate agenda.

26:04.475 --> 26:06.608
Like the fake Al-Qaeda
insurgent videos

26:06.652 --> 26:08.088
ordered by
the Defense Department.

26:08.131 --> 26:09.176
Exactly.

26:09.219 --> 26:10.438
And now all the
participants

26:10.481 --> 26:11.831
are being
systematically erased.

26:11.874 --> 26:13.572
Someone is trying
to cover it up.

26:13.615 --> 26:15.922
Your partner
knows all this, too?

26:15.965 --> 26:18.011
She's getting close.

26:18.054 --> 26:23.190
Julian, these victims
were civilians, innocents.

26:23.233 --> 26:25.105
They didn't
sign up for this.

26:25.148 --> 26:27.194
You're not only
jeopardizing yourself,

26:27.237 --> 26:28.848
but by involving
the NYPD...

26:28.891 --> 26:31.677
Then help me put a stop to this.

26:31.720 --> 26:33.243
We're running out of time.

26:33.287 --> 26:34.897
You're putting me in a
very difficult position.

26:36.986 --> 26:39.293
You've done the same to me.

26:41.904 --> 26:44.559
I went onto Telegram.

26:44.603 --> 26:47.301
Made myself an invited guest
in one of the private chats.

26:47.344 --> 26:49.303
I don't have
all the pieces,

26:49.346 --> 26:52.698
but enough to know
you're being watched.

26:52.741 --> 26:54.438
There's something you
should see, but not here.

26:57.180 --> 27:00.053
Okay, so Nancy Millhouse
entered Morocco on February 23.

27:00.096 --> 27:01.489
Look to see who else went there

27:01.532 --> 27:03.665
from the U.S.
at about the same time.

27:03.709 --> 27:05.319
Gavin Carson,
Lawrence Greenspan.

27:05.362 --> 27:07.321
Those are our other two vics.

27:07.364 --> 27:09.192
The film is the connection
between them.

27:09.236 --> 27:11.717
They all got to Morocco on
the same day, at the same time.

27:11.760 --> 27:13.849
There's one more person who
came in at the same time.

27:13.893 --> 27:15.198
Nelson Grimes.

27:15.242 --> 27:17.200
He's new. Pull up
his passport.

27:22.031 --> 27:23.511
Profession: actor.

27:23.554 --> 27:25.600
Nelson Grimes
could be our next victim.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.254
We need an address.

27:27.297 --> 27:28.734
No problem.

27:30.083 --> 27:31.737
Address is no
longer valid.

27:31.780 --> 27:32.999
None forwarding.

27:33.042 --> 27:34.348
Can you send me that link?

27:34.391 --> 27:35.871
Okay. I'll keep looking.

27:47.230 --> 27:49.363
Car's registered
to a rental company.

27:49.406 --> 27:50.886
Got an address.

27:50.930 --> 27:52.235
No phone listed.

27:53.584 --> 27:55.630
Should I come with you?No. Keep digging.

27:55.674 --> 27:57.284
See if you can find
a phone number for this guy.

27:57.327 --> 28:00.722
Have the local PD meet you
at the guy's address.

28:01.767 --> 28:03.769
Welcome to A-1 Gadgets.

28:03.812 --> 28:05.596
Is there anything
I can help you with?

28:05.640 --> 28:07.120
No, we're okay.

28:07.163 --> 28:10.166
Actually, I was in the market
for a USB eMAG dongle.

28:10.210 --> 28:12.908
We don't have those.Oh.

28:12.952 --> 28:15.694
According to your Web site,
there should be eight in stock.

28:15.737 --> 28:17.434
Can you please check
in the back?

28:17.478 --> 28:19.480
Um... okay.

28:25.051 --> 28:26.617
Let's get to work.

28:30.752 --> 28:34.582
Getting back-channel access
into a private video server.

28:45.245 --> 28:47.638
Secret meeting
in Morocco.

28:47.682 --> 28:50.032
As you suspected,
it was a propaganda video.

28:50.076 --> 28:52.078
Probably made
by a rogue intelligence group

28:52.121 --> 28:53.732
to create unrest in Chechnya.

28:53.775 --> 28:56.517
So Larry Greenspan
and Nancy Millhouse

28:56.560 --> 28:58.388
are playing
the Chechen president

28:58.432 --> 28:59.781
and his wife.
Uncanny resemblance.

28:59.825 --> 29:02.828
And here they are
meeting Gavin Carson,

29:02.871 --> 29:04.743
who is a dead ringer

29:04.786 --> 29:06.222
for the head
of the separatists.

29:06.266 --> 29:07.963
The film was obviously
designed to undermine

29:08.007 --> 29:10.052
the Chechen leader and
prompt a regime change.

29:10.096 --> 29:12.098
So our assassin
has to be a rogue operative

29:12.141 --> 29:13.795
from some
intelligence service,

29:13.839 --> 29:16.755
who now works for an oligarch
or a corporation

29:16.798 --> 29:19.409
or someone who has
enough resources

29:19.453 --> 29:20.802
to eliminate
all these people

29:20.846 --> 29:22.804
before the truth
about the existence

29:22.848 --> 29:24.937
of this film gets out.

29:24.980 --> 29:27.635
Any idea who
that assassin might be?

29:27.678 --> 29:29.942
I'd have to do
some more digging.

29:29.985 --> 29:32.118
There's no time to dig.

29:33.119 --> 29:35.512
All the victims are here.

29:36.644 --> 29:38.298
What is that

29:38.341 --> 29:40.126
Why is it black?

29:40.169 --> 29:41.214
Can you zoom in?

29:43.172 --> 29:44.652
Looks like
somebody's trying

29:44.695 --> 29:46.001
to cover something up.

29:48.003 --> 29:50.571
Let me see if I can find
the original file.

29:53.879 --> 29:55.532
Here we are.

29:58.492 --> 30:00.320
Bishop.

30:00.363 --> 30:02.017
Former operative
in MI6.

30:02.061 --> 30:03.845
Didn't he get burned
three years ago?

30:03.889 --> 30:05.716
Became an independent
contractor.

30:05.760 --> 30:06.979
And, apparently,
he was freelancing

30:07.022 --> 30:08.676
for the rogue
intelligence group.

30:08.719 --> 30:11.940
Who must have hired him
to create the propaganda film,

30:11.984 --> 30:16.162
and then... questions started
to be asked about the footage?

30:16.205 --> 30:19.339
And Bishop decided to erase
anyone who knew it was fiction.

30:19.382 --> 30:21.080
And he knew the victim's
vulnerabilities.

30:22.733 --> 30:23.865
If Bishop's
looking to erase

30:23.909 --> 30:25.171
anyone who knows
about the film,

30:25.214 --> 30:26.868
we've just put ourselves
on his hit list.

30:33.919 --> 30:35.703
Lizzie located Bishop.

30:35.746 --> 30:37.531
She thinks he's
the next victim.

30:39.576 --> 30:41.970
Oh, why doesn't she
answer her phone?

30:42.014 --> 30:43.711
She may be
out of range.

30:43.754 --> 30:45.844
Bishop's safe house
would be remote.

30:52.198 --> 30:54.200
I know how to find her.

31:10.520 --> 31:12.348
Nelson Grimes?
Yes.

31:12.392 --> 31:14.220
Detective Needham, NYPD.

31:14.263 --> 31:16.526
We think you might
be in danger.

31:16.570 --> 31:18.528
Danger?
Yes.

31:19.878 --> 31:22.576
Uh... please, come in.

31:35.937 --> 31:36.851
Morocco?

31:36.895 --> 31:38.070
That project was years ago.

31:38.113 --> 31:39.549
Why would someone
come after us now?

31:39.593 --> 31:41.725
I'm still trying to figure
that out, but I need

31:41.769 --> 31:43.205
to get you to the local
sheriff's station.

31:43.249 --> 31:44.380
Sheriff's station?
Yes.

31:44.424 --> 31:45.555
We need to get
you out of here.

31:45.599 --> 31:47.557
:
Okay. Uh...

31:47.601 --> 31:49.385
Just let me get
my stuff together.

31:49.429 --> 31:52.084
I'll call and let them
know we're coming.

31:52.127 --> 31:53.650
Cell service
is really bad here.

31:56.262 --> 31:59.047
I'm really grateful you came.

31:59.091 --> 32:01.789
Just trying to find
my reading glasses.

32:01.832 --> 32:03.399
Give me a sec.

32:12.669 --> 32:13.714
Ready.

33:20.911 --> 33:22.652
It's fresh.

33:23.305 --> 33:24.306
Come on.

33:26.134 --> 33:27.309
Take him alive.

33:29.355 --> 33:31.487
Lizzie!

33:31.531 --> 33:33.620
Lizzie!

33:37.319 --> 33:39.539
Lizzie.

33:45.545 --> 33:47.242
Lizzie, come on.

33:47.286 --> 33:49.288
Come on.

34:10.744 --> 34:12.224
Bishop.

34:12.267 --> 34:14.095
Playing with fire again?

34:14.139 --> 34:16.054
Hello, Julian.

34:27.239 --> 34:28.892
Wake up, Lizzie.

34:28.936 --> 34:30.807
Come on.

34:41.905 --> 34:43.820
You shot Grimes in self-defense.

34:43.864 --> 34:45.735
This is yours. It's clean.

34:45.779 --> 34:47.824
Call an ambulance.

34:47.868 --> 34:49.522
I'm on it.

34:54.918 --> 34:56.964
[indistinct police radio
communication]

35:02.274 --> 35:04.754
LIZZIE:
How did you find me?

35:04.798 --> 35:07.627
Your phone was out of range,
but your tracker wasn't.

35:07.670 --> 35:09.281
What tracker?

35:11.761 --> 35:13.154
Oh.

35:13.198 --> 35:15.330
Doggy GPS.

35:15.374 --> 35:17.115
Maybe being
overprotective

35:17.158 --> 35:19.117
isn't such a neurosis
after all.

35:20.901 --> 35:23.251
Why does it look like
there's two sets

35:23.295 --> 35:25.297
of motorcycle tracks
on the path?

35:32.086 --> 35:34.741
Sexy, juicy, spicy.

35:34.784 --> 35:35.959
Again, I'm confused.

35:36.003 --> 35:38.005
This is your idea for
a children's book?

35:38.048 --> 35:39.702
No, darling, I'm talking
about my taquitos.

35:39.746 --> 35:43.271
But I will say my idea for the
children's book is brilliant.

35:43.315 --> 35:45.186
By you solving
that plushy murder,

35:45.230 --> 35:46.318
you are trending
with nine-year-olds

35:46.361 --> 35:47.667
all over the world.

35:47.710 --> 35:48.711
Today, perhaps.

35:48.755 --> 35:50.017
Tomorrow, I'm not so sure.

35:50.060 --> 35:51.497
No, no.
You don't understand.

35:51.540 --> 35:55.196
Who's not going to love the idea
of a Dylan Reinhart take

35:55.240 --> 35:57.155
on Encyclopedia Brown,
honey?

35:57.198 --> 35:58.330
Picture it.

35:58.373 --> 35:59.853
Little Dylan,

35:59.896 --> 36:01.071
with little glasses

36:01.115 --> 36:03.030
and a tiny tweed suit,
sleuthing.

36:03.073 --> 36:05.685
I'm telling you,
it's a whole new demographic.

36:05.728 --> 36:08.514
Yeah, well, tell Scribner
I'll, uh, sleep on it.

36:08.557 --> 36:10.429
You're one of those people
who say, "I'll sleep on it,"

36:10.472 --> 36:11.473
and then you never do.

36:11.517 --> 36:13.388
Yes.
Ah.

36:13.432 --> 36:16.304
Well, you will be
the death of me.

36:16.348 --> 36:19.002
I'm sorry, Joan.Talking about my taquitos.

36:19.046 --> 36:20.178
ANDY:
All right.

36:20.221 --> 36:21.440
Any luck?No.

36:21.483 --> 36:22.876
You gotta help me with him.

36:22.919 --> 36:24.225
Mm.

36:24.269 --> 36:27.010
Actually, I may have
to help Dylan. One second.

36:27.054 --> 36:29.099
Hey! Drinks on Andy!Hey!

36:29.143 --> 36:30.971
FUCCI: Hey, how are you, man?ANDY: Good, man.

36:31.014 --> 36:32.364
FUCCI: Hey, look
who else is here--

36:32.407 --> 36:34.017
the man of the hour.

36:36.585 --> 36:39.022
You know them?Uh-huh. They're the
guys from the precinct.

36:39.066 --> 36:40.328
Shut up.
Mm-hmm.

36:40.372 --> 36:41.547
I'm just gonna go say hi.

36:41.590 --> 36:43.418
You do that.

36:45.115 --> 36:46.378
I'm really sorry.

36:46.421 --> 36:48.075
I-I had no idea
they were coming.

36:48.118 --> 36:50.338
I did. I invited them.

36:54.560 --> 36:57.171
Thank you for opening up
your life to me.

36:57.215 --> 36:58.825
It means a lot.

36:58.868 --> 37:00.827
FUCCI: Hey.
To Doc Reinhart.

37:00.870 --> 37:03.046
Another collar.
You're on a roll.

37:05.266 --> 37:06.833
Where's Lizzie?

37:09.270 --> 37:10.967
Hey.

37:11.011 --> 37:12.447
Hey.

37:18.323 --> 37:19.846
Can I do anything?

37:19.889 --> 37:22.152
Almost done.

37:25.025 --> 37:26.940
What does your report say?

37:26.983 --> 37:31.292
Only what I know,
which isn't saying a whole lot.

37:31.336 --> 37:32.685
One of
the advantages

37:32.728 --> 37:34.774
of being knocked on the
head with a shovel--

37:34.817 --> 37:37.994
I don't have to tell the truth
'cause I don't actually know it.

37:39.344 --> 37:40.954
Who would
have thought

37:40.997 --> 37:42.651
I'd be so good
at writing fiction?

37:42.695 --> 37:44.044
Maybe I should write a book.

37:44.087 --> 37:45.872
Lizzie.
Mm-hmm.

37:47.047 --> 37:48.135
I'm sorry.

37:48.178 --> 37:49.528
Yeah. Me, too.

37:49.571 --> 37:51.660
I had a partner
who hid things from me.

37:51.704 --> 37:53.445
Maybe he thought
it was protecting me.

37:53.488 --> 37:56.056
But I can't be put
in that position again.

37:56.099 --> 37:58.014
I need an honest
and open partner.

37:58.058 --> 38:00.452
You should not have
taken off without backup.

38:00.495 --> 38:01.844
You should've returned
your phone call.

38:01.888 --> 38:03.150
You should never have
been there in the first place.

38:03.193 --> 38:05.935
Your secrecy put me in danger.

38:13.378 --> 38:15.380
You're right.

38:16.511 --> 38:18.339
This is on me.

38:27.653 --> 38:31.787
I left the CIA not just because
of the risk of losing my life,

38:31.831 --> 38:34.224
but of losing my relationship.

38:37.489 --> 38:40.666
I know what it's like
to compartmentalize.

38:40.709 --> 38:42.102
I lived it.

38:43.451 --> 38:45.888
I saw how destructive it can be.

38:48.021 --> 38:50.371
I will not do that again.

38:53.722 --> 38:55.768
I have to trust you.

38:57.378 --> 38:59.075
You can.

39:03.732 --> 39:04.994
Everyone's at Andy's bar.

39:05.038 --> 39:06.126
You want to go?

39:09.695 --> 39:11.697
Do they allow dogs?

39:11.740 --> 39:13.002
I know the owner.

39:13.046 --> 39:14.743
I could talk to him.

39:15.962 --> 39:17.572
What do you say, Gary?
