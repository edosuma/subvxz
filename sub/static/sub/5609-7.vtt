NARRATOR: Previously on
Once Upon A Time...

00:03.545 --> 00:05.661
You destroyed
the only woman I ever loved.

00:05.756 --> 00:08.623
EMMA: Anâ€˜hur knows we freed Merlin
and he's really not happy about it.

00:08.717 --> 00:09.923
You ruined my life!

00:10.010 --> 00:11.750
We both know
that broken sword can't hurt me.

00:12.930 --> 00:14.511
ARTHUR: Emma has Excalibur.

00:14.598 --> 00:17.635
The restored weapon has great power.
It can destroy all light magic.

00:17.726 --> 00:19.933
That's her plan.
To snuff out the light forever.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.762
-What are you?
-Rumplestiltskin is but one of many.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.847
All the Dark Ones are inside you.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.562
MERLIN: There is only one person
who can help you

00:27.611 --> 00:28.771
defeat the Dark One now.

00:28.862 --> 00:31.820
Her name is Nimue.

(RUMPLESTILTSKIN GIGGLES)

00:51.552 --> 00:53.964
Beautiful, aren't they?

00:54.054 --> 00:57.091
Both halves finally reunited.

00:57.182 --> 00:58.968
You know what they represent now,
don't you?

01:00.269 --> 01:01.304
Power.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.807
It's much more than power, dearie.

01:04.898 --> 01:06.354
lt's history.

01:06.984 --> 01:10.818
Excalibur's promise was born eons ago.

01:10.904 --> 01:15.898
And now it's time
for that promise to be fulfilled.

01:39.016 --> 01:40.005
(BOTH GRUNTING)

01:40.434 --> 01:42.390
-They following?
-No.

01:43.186 --> 01:47.225
They wouldn't trail escaped generals
into this, much less foot soldiers.

01:48.692 --> 01:50.353
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

01:53.905 --> 01:56.066
Look! Look!

01:56.158 --> 01:57.648
There it is again.

01:57.743 --> 02:01.110
That's a mirage, Merlin.
There's no water there.

02:01.204 --> 02:03.616
I would rather find out for sure
than lie here and die.

02:03.707 --> 02:05.368
-Come on.
-(G RU NTS)

02:17.804 --> 02:19.920
That's a gift from the gods.

02:20.641 --> 02:23.007
We're hardly worth notice
from the gods.

02:23.101 --> 02:24.762
The gods could do worse.

02:24.853 --> 02:27.469
But if you don't want any...

Well, then.

02:50.796 --> 02:53.208
With your permission...

03:01.098 --> 03:02.554
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

03:13.151 --> 03:14.357
Thank you.

03:14.444 --> 03:16.150
Thank you.

03:25.247 --> 03:27.033
(GRUNTS)

03:38.635 --> 03:41.172
I have magic.

03:52.482 --> 03:54.438
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

04:13.628 --> 04:16.040
So you can really do it.
Take the Dark One dagger

04:16.131 --> 04:18.873
and put it together with Arthur's sword
to recreate the original Excalibur?

04:18.967 --> 04:20.002
I hope so.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.333
And we can use it to save Emma.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.293
MERLIN: Perhaps, but I need two things.

04:23.388 --> 04:25.299
The magical means
to unite the two blades,

04:25.390 --> 04:26.971
that's my and Emma's quest.

04:27.058 --> 04:29.140
-From you, I need...
-The two blades.

04:29.978 --> 04:32.435
We're pretty much
at the open warfare stage now,

04:32.522 --> 04:34.513
getting the partial sword from Arthur
won't be easy.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.894
As long as you're looking at the future,
any hints on how?

04:36.985 --> 04:38.441
Well, the future isn't exact.

04:38.528 --> 04:40.268
-There are many paths to...
-Of course there are.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.021
You're willing to send us
behind enemy lines,

04:43.116 --> 04:47.234
but when it comes to specifics,
everything's a little fuzzy, in'it?

04:47.329 --> 04:48.910
-Hook, Merlin's helping Emma.
-Is he?

04:48.997 --> 04:50.282
She's sitting out there right now

04:50.373 --> 04:52.910
making things to pull memories
out of people's heads

04:53.001 --> 04:55.617
because that's what she does now
instead of sleeping.

04:55.712 --> 04:57.498
I'm not quite seeing the "helping."

04:57.589 --> 04:58.704
MERLIN: I understand.

04:58.799 --> 05:01.165
I know what it is to lose someone
you love to the Dark One.

05:02.636 --> 05:05.878
All I can ask of all of you
is that you bring me that sword,

05:08.642 --> 05:10.348
and that you have patience with Emma.

05:11.394 --> 05:14.807
Her kind of power, for good or evil,

05:14.898 --> 05:17.435
it is a weight on the soul,

05:17.526 --> 05:19.892
and love is a great help,

05:19.986 --> 05:22.102
if you can find it.

05:27.035 --> 05:28.275
MERLIN: There. You are healed.

05:28.370 --> 05:29.655
MAN: Gratitude, Great Merlin.

05:29.746 --> 05:31.737
You're both very welcome.

05:36.002 --> 05:37.253
Wait.

05:39.089 --> 05:42.581
I didn't see her arrive.
I'll get her to leave.

05:42.634 --> 05:43.794
What does she want?

05:44.302 --> 05:45.678
Don't you know?

05:45.762 --> 05:47.753
You always know.

05:47.806 --> 05:48.886
I'll talk to her.

05:48.932 --> 05:52.095
Uh, you head back,
check on the brooms.

05:58.108 --> 05:59.348
Have you come to see me?

06:01.444 --> 06:02.604
You're Merlin?

06:02.654 --> 06:04.770
Not all wizards have long white beards.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.481
Please, tell me. What brings you here?

06:07.617 --> 06:09.653
My village.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.952
Uh, I was in my garden,

06:12.998 --> 06:15.159
when a masked man rode in.

06:15.292 --> 06:16.657
His name is Vortigan.

06:17.460 --> 06:20.952
He ransacks towns
and burns them to the ground,

06:21.006 --> 06:24.544
so I fled on foot to the woods.

06:24.634 --> 06:27.467
I looked back from the hillside
and everything was in flames.

06:28.179 --> 06:30.636
He had killed everyone.

06:30.682 --> 06:31.717
I'm so sorry.

06:31.808 --> 06:34.641
Please allow me to help you.
What can I grant you?

06:34.686 --> 06:35.721
Revenge.

06:37.647 --> 06:40.639
These were all I had on me when I ran.

06:41.151 --> 06:43.187
They're seeds
from the Middlemist flower.

06:43.695 --> 06:46.311
They only prosper around my village.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.988
When Vortigan scorched the earth,
he could have killed them forever.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.993
My best revenge would be
for them to live on despite him.

06:55.081 --> 06:56.491
We will plant them here.

06:58.376 --> 07:00.162
Thank you.

07:00.837 --> 07:04.500
If the flowers survive, at least
something other than me lived on.

07:11.348 --> 07:14.055
I'll try and pass through again in spring.

07:14.142 --> 07:16.804
(SIGHS) I want to see them in bloom.

07:16.853 --> 07:18.593
Well, why wait?

07:24.736 --> 07:25.725

07:32.118 --> 07:35.702
Stay close.
You can come and see them anytime.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.538

07:44.381 --> 07:46.793

07:46.883 --> 07:48.214

07:50.637 --> 07:52.593
I hope so.

07:55.892 --> 07:57.098
What's your name?

07:59.229 --> 08:00.560

Nimue.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.407
MERLIN: Emma.

08:15.745 --> 08:16.951
Emma.

08:19.749 --> 08:22.240
Emma, there is a way
to make Excalibur whole again.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.955
Will you come with me today,
so we can get what we need?

08:25.088 --> 08:26.077
It's not far.

08:26.172 --> 08:28.254
-What is it?
-A spark.

08:28.299 --> 08:31.132
From mankind's original fire,
the flame of Prometheus.

08:31.970 --> 08:34.256
Its heat forged Excalibur,

08:34.305 --> 08:35.841
and that's what we'll need
to put it back together.

08:36.808 --> 08:38.594
So, will you come with me
to collect the spark?

08:38.643 --> 08:40.599
We'll be back by nightfall.

08:42.272 --> 08:45.014
You look dire. What is it?

08:49.446 --> 08:51.437
When we get there,

08:51.531 --> 08:53.772
we will need to deal
with the First Dark One.

08:54.617 --> 08:56.949
The one who wore the mask?
The one who killed the woman you love.

08:57.370 --> 08:58.951
The very same.

08:58.997 --> 09:00.612
This is not a trivial task.

09:01.833 --> 09:05.371
I was seeing Rumplestiltskin
like a voice in my head.

09:05.462 --> 09:07.373
Ijust got rid of him.

09:07.464 --> 09:09.125
And now you want me
to let another one in?

09:09.174 --> 09:12.291
Yes. And not just anyone.

09:12.343 --> 09:15.130
This is the first Dark One. The original.

09:15.180 --> 09:18.013
The one from whom
all the evil that followed was born.

09:20.810 --> 09:22.016
Will we win?

09:22.312 --> 09:23.427
(SIGHS)

09:24.314 --> 09:26.646
I see two paths for ourjourney, Emma.

09:27.650 --> 09:30.687
On one, you resist the darkness
and we succeed.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.981
On the other,
you succumb to the darkness.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.984
And I do not return. I die.

09:35.366 --> 09:36.492
You die... But...

09:36.534 --> 09:38.866
Even immortality has exceptions.

09:38.995 --> 09:41.327
A Dark One does have
the power to kill me.

09:41.372 --> 09:43.408
But they won't even be there. Not really.

09:46.169 --> 09:47.158
Oh.

09:48.505 --> 09:51.497
It would be me.
If you died, it would be me.

09:51.591 --> 09:55.004
Ifl die, it means
that you lost your battle,

09:55.053 --> 09:57.886
and the darkness stained your soul.

09:58.014 --> 09:59.515
Everything and everyone that you know

09:59.557 --> 10:01.718
will be at the mercy

Yourself.

10:08.191 --> 10:09.681
No pressure.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.077
You'll return by nightfall, right?

10:23.206 --> 10:26.369
Yes. We go get this spark thing,

10:26.417 --> 10:28.203
and then I'm working my way
back to you, babe.

10:28.294 --> 10:29.875
I know when you're quoting something.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.453
And I love
that you never know what it is.

10:32.215 --> 10:33.375
Anyway, with a bit of luck,

10:34.050 --> 10:37.042
we put Excalibur together tomorrow
and then, bam, no more darkness.

to marry the woman he loves

I didn't always have magic.

said how it happened.

The Holy Grail.
You found the Holy Grail?

14:51.641 --> 14:56.601
I don't want this moment to get lost
in an endless sea of time.

14:58.106 --> 15:01.348
Come. We'll make the preparations.

15:11.035 --> 15:12.741
MARY: Okay, what's the plan?

15:12.829 --> 15:14.990
We take them by surprise
and go in through the front gate.

15:15.665 --> 15:18.828
Well, after ourjailbreak,
they'll be on high alert.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.450
We need a diversion at the drawbridge,

15:20.503 --> 15:22.209
the rest of us can climb the wall
on the side.

15:22.338 --> 15:26.001
Are you forgetting? I've got magic.
I can just poof into Arthur's bedroom.

15:26.175 --> 15:27.164
(SCOFFS)

15:27.844 --> 15:28.959
What?

15:31.013 --> 15:33.504
Well, if you're going to make a scene,
you might as well make noise.

15:33.599 --> 15:34.588
(WHOOSH)

15:34.851 --> 15:36.307
Oh! Thank you.

15:36.352 --> 15:39.719
I do love hearing a sensible person talk.

15:39.856 --> 15:41.972
Spit it out. What're you thinking?

15:42.024 --> 15:44.515
I'm thinking, going in the front, suicide.

15:44.569 --> 15:47.857
Diversion. Arthur hides the sword.
You need it on him.

15:47.989 --> 15:49.650
And you could poof
right in front of a blade.

15:49.699 --> 15:50.734
Oopsy.

15:50.867 --> 15:52.858
You need to sneak in so quietly,

15:52.952 --> 15:53.987
(WHISPERS) no one knows you're there.

15:54.036 --> 15:57.324
How? Hang glider? Oh, giant slingshot.

15:57.373 --> 15:58.874
If Sir-Castic would let me speak,

15:59.000 --> 16:01.332
I'd tell you that I wasn't idle
during those days in there,

16:01.377 --> 16:03.709
playing mute handmaiden
at Regina's side.

16:03.754 --> 16:05.210
I was plotting an escape.

16:05.339 --> 16:06.374
I knew it.

16:06.507 --> 16:08.338
And I found a way out.

16:08.384 --> 16:10.670
And if I know a way out, I know a way in.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.176
You're going to help us?

16:12.221 --> 16:14.382
Of course.

16:14.515 --> 16:16.892
Because you're going to help me.

16:16.934 --> 16:18.720
I want my magic back.

16:23.399 --> 16:25.139
ZELENA: It's a tunnel.
Abandoned for years.

16:25.234 --> 16:26.610
It'll take you to the courtyard.

16:26.736 --> 16:29.569
KILLIAN: Well, if it's so good,
why didn't you escape through it?

16:29.697 --> 16:31.904
Observe the massive metal grate.

16:31.949 --> 16:34.440
See, without magic, I'm a delicate thing.

16:35.411 --> 16:37.242
Well, it leads in the right direction.

16:37.288 --> 16:39.904
Looks like her information is good,
at least this far.

16:39.957 --> 16:41.072
ZELENA: Thank you.

16:41.209 --> 16:43.575
Now I've done my part,
you can do yours.

16:43.711 --> 16:44.917
Take off this bloody cuff.

16:45.046 --> 16:47.458
For all we know,
this leads to the guards' quarters.

16:47.590 --> 16:50.047
We make it out safe with the sword,
then we'll talk.

16:50.092 --> 16:52.469
Mary Margaret,
how do you feel about guard duty?

16:52.595 --> 16:53.801
Oh, I'd be delighted.

16:53.930 --> 16:56.296
We'll chat.
I have plenty of pregnancy tips.

16:56.432 --> 16:59.424
Good Lord. This is worse
than being in my cell.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.266
All right, everyone. (SIGHS)

17:01.312 --> 17:03.098
Let's get this sword.

17:23.960 --> 17:26.167
These are powerful ingredients, Arthur.

17:26.295 --> 17:27.910
I hope you know what you're doing.

17:27.964 --> 17:29.420
We need something to protect us.

17:29.966 --> 17:34.926
These people drop from the sky,
then they turn on us, freeing prisoners.

17:34.971 --> 17:37.303
They won't stop
until they've taken everything from me.

17:41.018 --> 17:42.519
Guards!

17:42.979 --> 17:44.264
Infidels are on their way.

17:44.313 --> 17:45.348
Call up the reserves.

17:45.481 --> 17:47.597
Get every man on the parapet
and patrol every hall.

17:47.650 --> 17:49.481
And you, give me your helm.

17:54.031 --> 17:57.148
The ladle and the cauldron
have special protection spells.

17:58.327 --> 18:00.534
This helmet and our friends

18:01.330 --> 18:02.319
do not.

18:11.507 --> 18:14.670
Throw this on any stranger you see
and bring me what's left of them.

18:16.971 --> 18:19.178
It'll be nothing but teeth and bones.

18:21.684 --> 18:24.016
This is war now.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.222
EMMA: When I was seeing
Rumplestiltskin in my head,

18:29.317 --> 18:33.526
he said he'd only be with me
until I embraced my dark powers.

18:34.363 --> 18:37.526
So recently I've been thinking
maybe not seeing him,

18:37.658 --> 18:38.738
maybe that's a bad thing.

18:38.868 --> 18:40.699
Have you embraced your powers?

18:44.915 --> 18:47.076
I've done some dark things recently.

18:48.085 --> 18:50.041
I hurt someone.

18:51.547 --> 18:52.878
My son.

18:56.260 --> 18:58.751
And if I dig deep down...

19:00.765 --> 19:03.097
The darkness is winning.

19:04.393 --> 19:05.769
But there's hope, right?

19:05.895 --> 19:08.386
You wouldn't be bothering
to get this spark

19:08.522 --> 19:10.023
if there wasn't still hope.

19:11.025 --> 19:12.890
There is hope.

19:13.778 --> 19:15.063
And it's up there.

19:17.406 --> 19:18.737
That's a whole lot of up.

19:18.866 --> 19:19.901
We can make it.

19:21.410 --> 19:23.241
The question is,

19:23.371 --> 19:25.032
will I come down?

19:38.969 --> 19:43.212
NIMUE: This was my village, my home.
Look what's become of it.

19:56.278 --> 19:58.940
My house was right here.

20:01.992 --> 20:04.608
Or maybe it was there.

20:05.830 --> 20:06.910
(SCOFFS)

20:07.081 --> 20:09.117
Oh, it's so different now.

20:09.250 --> 20:13.619
Sometimes the sole survivor
of a tragedy can feel guilty.

20:14.630 --> 20:17.121
-In the future, they'll call it...
-I don't feel guilty.

20:17.174 --> 20:19.290
I feel angry.

20:19.969 --> 20:25.009
This shouldn't be the way
that those who cannot take are taken.

20:25.141 --> 20:26.972
Ifl had magic like yours,

20:27.101 --> 20:31.140
ifl had a million lifetimes
to hand out power to those who need it

20:31.188 --> 20:32.473
and to strike down those who...

20:32.523 --> 20:34.138
Nimue, shh.

20:35.860 --> 20:37.771
It's been decided.

20:47.788 --> 20:49.494

20:49.582 --> 20:52.665
It looks like every household
brought out their cups for him.

20:52.793 --> 20:54.658
Why would they...

20:54.837 --> 20:55.826
Oh.

20:55.921 --> 20:57.661
He was questing for the Grail.

20:58.174 --> 21:00.665
And torching down each hiding place

21:01.051 --> 21:02.916
(EXHALES) as he annihilated it.

21:03.512 --> 21:05.844
Will you check the pack
and make sure the Grail is secure?

21:05.931 --> 21:08.013
I've never taken it away
from the tower before.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.682
I'm going to perform a detection spell.

21:22.448 --> 21:24.939
Over the horizon,
the way we came. Hurry.

21:25.034 --> 21:26.649
He's just a man.

21:26.702 --> 21:29.364
You could kill him
with one magical word.

21:29.497 --> 21:32.989
No, if! use magic to kill,
darkness will take root inside of me.

21:33.042 --> 21:36.375
Nothing, nothing is worth risking that.

21:57.983 --> 22:00.065

we don't want to find out.

29:53.208 --> 29:56.996
Let's not think about cutting away
anyone's magic or immortality.

29:57.045 --> 29:58.205
Please don't.

29:58.839 --> 30:00.704
Don't do this. Nimue.

30:02.175 --> 30:03.210
No!

30:06.179 --> 30:07.510
No.

30:23.822 --> 30:24.982
I'm sorry.

30:25.407 --> 30:28.149
(SIGHS) No, Nimue.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.070
I'm sorry.

30:42.341 --> 30:43.581
Nimue.

30:45.344 --> 30:46.754
Yes.

30:46.887 --> 30:49.594
I'm Nimue. And you're Emma.

30:50.891 --> 30:52.427
How pretty,

30:52.559 --> 30:55.426
the First Dark One
and the newest Dark One,

30:55.520 --> 30:58.102
standing as sisters.

30:59.608 --> 31:01.098
It makes sense.

31:01.526 --> 31:02.857
You killed the woman he loved

31:02.944 --> 31:06.072
because you killed
the woman you used to be.

31:06.114 --> 31:07.365
Why didn't you tell me?

31:07.449 --> 31:09.280
I did tell you.

31:10.077 --> 31:12.284
The creature over there
is the First Dark One.

31:12.371 --> 31:14.282
It's not the woman I loved.

31:15.707 --> 31:17.743
It's been a long time, Merlin.

31:26.802 --> 31:29.259
I've thought of you every day.

31:30.931 --> 31:32.967
And now on your last day,

31:33.100 --> 31:34.806
I'll be your last thought.

31:34.935 --> 31:36.471
How poetic.

31:38.814 --> 31:40.645
Why are you doing this? You loved him.

31:40.690 --> 31:43.818
Even when you love someone,
you have to say,

31:43.860 --> 31:48.650
"No, this is mine.
You can't take it away from me."

31:48.698 --> 31:50.529
And if they don't listen,

31:50.659 --> 31:53.822
if they try to stop you from being you,

31:53.954 --> 31:55.285
then you have no choice.

31:55.831 --> 31:57.321
You have to kill them.

31:57.999 --> 31:58.988
Oh...

31:59.584 --> 32:00.619
(GROANS)

32:00.669 --> 32:01.954
And you're doing this.

32:04.756 --> 32:07.213
-(MERLIN CHOKING)
-Because we are one and the same now.

32:07.342 --> 32:08.673
All Dark Ones.

32:08.718 --> 32:12.051
And we must destroy the threat to us.
We must destroy Merlin.

32:12.180 --> 32:13.340
Emma, please.

32:13.849 --> 32:15.305
It's not me!

32:15.851 --> 32:17.637
-Finish the job.
-Don't listen...

32:17.686 --> 32:19.802
He wants you to make a sword
to destroy me.

32:19.855 --> 32:21.811
To destroy us.

32:21.857 --> 32:23.188
You can control this.

32:23.316 --> 32:24.476
Don't listen to him.

32:24.526 --> 32:26.312
He doesn't understand
what you and I do.

32:26.361 --> 32:28.522
He doesn't understand the power.

32:28.655 --> 32:31.567
If you don't kill him now,
you'll go back to being powerless.

32:31.700 --> 32:34.487
Killing is the dark path.

32:34.536 --> 32:38.028
No. It's power. To protect
yourself and your loved ones.

32:38.165 --> 32:39.371
Let the light win.

32:39.499 --> 32:41.876
Kill him! Don't go back to being nothing!

32:44.254 --> 32:46.711
I'm not nothing! I was never nothing!

32:46.756 --> 32:48.712
The power you have, I don't need!

32:54.681 --> 32:56.512
Now I am going to take
that ember from you,

32:56.558 --> 32:57.718
and you're going to let me.

32:58.727 --> 32:59.716
(GASPS)

33:01.771 --> 33:03.352
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

33:07.110 --> 33:09.351
The spark you need is in there.

33:10.780 --> 33:14.272
But the sword you will make
has more than one use,

33:14.409 --> 33:17.116
and I am not dead yet, girl.

33:17.621 --> 33:20.909
You know where to find me
when you want me.

33:21.583 --> 33:23.574
I'll be right in...

33:24.920 --> 33:26.911
...there.

33:41.561 --> 33:43.426
MERLIN: You did it.

33:44.439 --> 33:45.940
Idid.

33:46.316 --> 33:50.275
How does it feel to take the right path?

33:53.907 --> 33:56.740
To be honest, Merlin,

33:56.785 --> 33:59.447
it feels damn good.

33:59.579 --> 34:00.864
(BREATH ES SHAKILY)

34:09.172 --> 34:12.005
What happened after
she turned into the Dark One?

34:12.133 --> 34:15.591
First, my apprentice and I made sure
the sword would be safe.

34:25.188 --> 34:26.803
Then, I created the dagger.

34:27.816 --> 34:30.148
l tethered her spirit to it
so I could control

34:30.277 --> 34:32.438
and prevent her reign of terror.

34:33.780 --> 34:36.146
But eventually she got it away from me.

34:36.199 --> 34:39.157
She put you in the tree.
She wore the mask then.

34:39.661 --> 34:40.946
Yes.

34:40.996 --> 34:44.329
She took that mask from a man
who did her great harm.

34:44.374 --> 34:49.368
It's easier to live with the darkness
if you can dress it up as vengeance.

34:52.382 --> 34:55.124
I realize your heart was broken,
but now I know.

34:55.176 --> 34:57.792
Nimue loves you still.

34:58.638 --> 35:01.675
It's all twisted up, but I felt it.

35:02.642 --> 35:05.099
Thank you. (INHALES DEEPLY)

35:05.186 --> 35:07.177
That means a lot to me.

35:07.814 --> 35:09.395
YOUNG APPRENTICE:
Too bad you couldn't see her future.

35:10.317 --> 35:12.899
You could have not talked to her
in the first place.

35:13.570 --> 35:15.902
No, no, my boy. No, never think that.

35:16.031 --> 35:18.147
Even now I would live through it again.

35:18.825 --> 35:21.316
Life is made of moments.

35:22.203 --> 35:24.364
And I had the best moments
of my life with her.

35:26.041 --> 35:27.372
EMMA: Is it possible

35:28.043 --> 35:29.874
for someone to have the darkness
but use it for good,

35:29.919 --> 35:31.580
-use it to protect people?
-Emma.

35:32.714 --> 35:34.204
Don't let those thoughts tempt you.

35:35.717 --> 35:37.423
But is it true?

35:38.553 --> 35:41.590
Someday, perhaps,
there will be a person

35:41.723 --> 35:43.429
who's worthy to hold that much power

35:43.558 --> 35:45.674
and not let it burn
through to darken their soul.

35:46.895 --> 35:48.931
But if we can wipe out the darkness,

35:49.064 --> 35:51.726
we'll never have to
ask that much of anyone.

35:52.233 --> 35:55.225
Sounds like we need to find
the other half of Excalibur.

36:00.241 --> 36:02.448
Foul witch,
you have overpowered the guards...

36:04.913 --> 36:05.902
The sword's on the table!

36:05.955 --> 36:08.332
Don't touch it.
It could have protection charms.

36:08.416 --> 36:10.907
Tell your timbers
to stop shivering, pirate.

36:10.960 --> 36:12.871
Nothing in here can hurt us.

36:12.921 --> 36:14.707
Arthur doesn't know how to do magic.

36:16.216 --> 36:17.456
Hi, guys.

36:17.592 --> 36:19.253
Oh, hell, no.

36:19.302 --> 36:20.382
Mary Margaret! If you hurt her...

36:20.553 --> 36:21.588
-Ooh.
-(G RU NTS)

36:21.638 --> 36:23.094
Daddy's angry.

36:24.766 --> 36:26.222
Let's undo that.

36:26.309 --> 36:27.344
-(WHOOSH)
-Ah.

36:27.435 --> 36:28.595
How did...

36:28.645 --> 36:31.478
Well, Arthur was kind enough
to remove that constricting jewelry.

36:31.606 --> 36:34.769
Fine. I prefer an even fight.

36:35.902 --> 36:37.438
No, don't! The baby.

36:38.822 --> 36:41.279
You know, if you'd treated me
fairly for once,

36:41.408 --> 36:42.739
maybe I wouldn't turn on you.

36:42.784 --> 36:44.570
Yes, you would.

36:44.619 --> 36:46.200
But I'd enjoy it less.

36:46.287 --> 36:47.993
Oh! Here we are.

36:48.581 --> 36:50.117
One of Merlin's cookbooks.

36:50.250 --> 36:52.332
-Is it the right spell?
-ZELENA: Oh, yes.

36:52.460 --> 36:54.746
Quite an ingenious recipe
for a tethering potion.

36:55.463 --> 36:56.964
ARTH U R: Excellent.

37:00.760 --> 37:03.297
(LAUGHS) There, you can take it now.

37:04.347 --> 37:07.134
Cookies are done.
And by cookies, I mean that Artie here

37:07.183 --> 37:09.925
may have a shorter sword
than a man would like,

37:09.978 --> 37:12.310
but it can control
the world's greatest wizard.

37:15.316 --> 37:17.773
His plan, but I like it. Happy to help.

37:17.819 --> 37:19.810
Most obliged, my lady.

37:19.946 --> 37:21.982
Arthur. Please.

37:22.031 --> 37:24.818
You can't see a way out,
but there is one. You can start over.

37:24.951 --> 37:26.487
-Merlin!
-We've all started over.

37:26.619 --> 37:28.155
-Merlin!
-Emma is worth more to you

37:28.204 --> 37:29.785
as the Savior than the Dark One.

37:30.999 --> 37:32.330
Thank you, David.

37:33.460 --> 37:35.496
But... Merlin!

37:38.298 --> 37:40.630
Henry, my God, he's growing up so fast,

37:40.675 --> 37:42.290
-sometimes I can hardly believe...
-(WHOOSH)

37:47.515 --> 37:49.016
(WHOOSH)

37:51.644 --> 37:53.384
Ah, Merlin.

37:53.521 --> 37:55.637
How kind of you to come when called.

37:55.690 --> 37:58.523
For your first task,
please use your magic

37:58.651 --> 38:01.484
to keep these fine people
from attacking me in any way.

38:02.864 --> 38:04.695
-(WHOOSH)
-(SWORDS CLATTER)

38:04.824 --> 38:06.405
ZELENA: (LAUGHS) Wow.

38:07.494 --> 38:09.030
It is done, Arthur.

38:11.915 --> 38:14.372
You can put that down.
We don't have to do this.

38:17.170 --> 38:18.660
Emma has passed her test.

38:20.048 --> 38:21.709
ARTHUR: Oh, Emma passed a test?

38:21.841 --> 38:23.456
(CHUCKLES) How nice for her.

38:23.551 --> 38:27.510
I have what we need to unite Excalibur
and fulfill your legacy.

38:27.555 --> 38:28.761
Give me the sword.

38:28.890 --> 38:31.097
You mean give you the glory.

38:31.559 --> 38:32.548
No.

38:33.186 --> 38:34.926
Glory?

38:35.063 --> 38:37.554
You seek glory.
Is that really what you've become?

38:37.690 --> 38:40.022
I am so sorry
I wasn't there to guide you, Arthur.

38:40.068 --> 38:41.524
This isn't the man
you were supposed to be.

38:41.569 --> 38:44.857
Oh, I am exactly what you made me.

38:46.199 --> 38:50.909
"Look at the half-man with his
half-sword, solving riddles from a tree."

38:51.037 --> 38:52.243
I bet you laughed.

38:52.372 --> 38:56.035
I was trapped, and I put my faith in you.

38:57.585 --> 38:58.961
You were meant to be like a son to me.

38:59.087 --> 39:00.452
Shut your mouth.

39:01.548 --> 39:03.254
I was never a son to you.

39:04.259 --> 39:05.419
You lied.

39:06.094 --> 39:09.131
You told me legend would speak
of the great King Arthur

39:09.264 --> 39:11.926
using Excalibur
to strike darkness from the realm.

39:12.058 --> 39:14.470
Tell me how this was not a lie!

39:14.894 --> 39:18.603
Because you will do that.
You're a part of doing it right now.

39:18.731 --> 39:19.891
A part of it.

39:19.941 --> 39:21.101
MERLIN: We have what we need.

39:21.442 --> 39:24.605
The future is in your hands, Arthur.

39:25.280 --> 39:28.898
Give me the sword.
We can repair everything.

39:30.952 --> 39:33.113
No. Not everything.

39:33.663 --> 39:36.450
This is my charge and my right.

39:36.583 --> 39:39.325
I will be known
for more than defeating a stone.

39:39.460 --> 39:40.996
-Arthur, you cannot...
-Be quiet.

39:43.131 --> 39:45.463
We have intruders.

39:46.509 --> 39:47.624
Make them leave.

40:06.487 --> 40:07.522
RUMPLESTILTSKIN: Go on.

40:08.156 --> 40:09.646
It's time.

40:09.782 --> 40:11.488
Why will you not leave me alone?

40:11.618 --> 40:13.324
Well, how could we?

40:13.453 --> 40:16.820
We're here
to witness something historical.

40:16.956 --> 40:19.993
Rumplestiltskin's eyes
are fine to look through most days.

40:20.043 --> 40:22.125
But I wanted to see this myself.

40:24.172 --> 40:26.163
You tried to keep me from doing this.

40:26.299 --> 40:27.379
Back then, there was a chance

40:27.508 --> 40:29.999
that you would use Excalibur
to cut away the darkness.

40:30.053 --> 40:32.635
But now you can
dowse the light instead.

40:33.640 --> 40:36.222
We are proud of you.

40:36.559 --> 40:37.844
All of us.

40:37.894 --> 40:40.351
DARK ONES: (ECHOING WHISPERS)
All of us. All of us.

41:03.586 --> 41:04.871
(SIZZLING)

41:32.073 --> 41:33.904
(DARK SWAN BREATHING HEAVILY)

41:42.083 --> 41:43.072
Merlin.

41:45.294 --> 41:47.910
Leave the sword alone.

41:52.427 --> 41:55.464
He told me not to do this
when I was a girl.

41:56.431 --> 41:58.467
And now you're a woman.

42:02.228 --> 42:04.435
Take the power.

42:04.480 --> 42:06.732
DARK ONES: (WHISPERING)
Take the power. Take the power.

42:08.985 --> 42:10.100
(WHISPERING STOPS)
