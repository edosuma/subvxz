00:00.807 --> 00:05.323
All those kids and their hipping
and their hopping.

00:05.487 --> 00:08.957
Pull up your damned pants,
you morons!

00:11.927 --> 00:16.557
Second Comedy Central special,
it`s gonna be great!

00:16.727 --> 00:20.686
No, Mommy.
l don`t want to wear the pink bow.

00:20.847 --> 00:25.159
He even does this in his sleep.
What a freak!

00:25.327 --> 00:28.444
Would you idiots give it a rest?

00:28.607 --> 00:31.599
Would you like to see my stick?

00:46.647 --> 00:48.763
Thank you!

00:50.167 --> 00:53.159
Thank you.

00:56.367 --> 00:59.996
Are you doing alright?
Thank you.

01:01.087 --> 01:03.726
Thank you so much.

01:11.367 --> 01:16.077
Alright. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

01:17.247 --> 01:23.197
You can`t fool me. l know it`s all
for the little guys in the suitcase.

01:29.007 --> 01:32.443
Thank you for coming out tonight.
This is such a pleasure.

01:32.607 --> 01:36.964
Before we start, l must say it is a
true honor to be in this theater-

01:37.127 --> 01:41.484
-with you people, in the capital of
the greatest country in the world-

01:41.647 --> 01:43.638
-the United States of America.

01:52.527 --> 01:55.200
ln driving around
the city the last couple of days-

01:55.367 --> 01:58.803
-l couldn`t help but realize that
here in D.C., like everywhere else-

01:58.967 --> 02:02.198
-gas prices suck!

02:02.367 --> 02:07.566
My wife and l live in L.A.,
and we were owners of 2 big SUVs.

02:07.727 --> 02:11.002
We decided to do the economically
and ecologically right thing.

02:11.167 --> 02:17.276
We got rid of one of the
big, giant SUVs and got a Prius.

02:17.447 --> 02:20.200
l don`t know why you`re laughing,
it`s a great vehicle.

02:20.367 --> 02:23.723
You jump on the freeway
and punch it, it goes:

02:28.047 --> 02:30.845
When you can drive
underneath an 18-wheeler and go:

02:31.007 --> 02:34.124
``That`s really dirty``,
and drive back out...

02:36.687 --> 02:39.645
That is just too damned small.

02:39.807 --> 02:44.005
lt`s cool at the gas pump. On one
tank you`ve driven 2 or 3000 miles.

02:44.167 --> 02:48.604
You fill up and go:
``Oh, all done! l`ll be damned.``

02:48.767 --> 02:51.361
``10 cents? That`s amazing!``

02:51.527 --> 02:55.281
l`m not used to a vehicle like this.
l`ve had big trucks and SUVs.

02:55.447 --> 02:58.564
The one vehicle l refuse to
get rid of, l`ve had it for 10 years.

02:58.727 --> 03:01.480
l love this thing.
l`ve taken good care of it.

03:01.647 --> 03:04.525
lt`s not politically correct
to drive it. l don`t care.

03:04.687 --> 03:09.238
H-1 Hummer. The real one,
the big one, the military version.

03:12.487 --> 03:16.196
l love this thing.
lt has a 38-gallon tank.

03:16.367 --> 03:20.326
Gets 7 miles to the gallon.

03:20.487 --> 03:24.719
Diesel, where l live,
at its peak was $3.84 per gallon.

03:24.887 --> 03:27.640
Yeah. l went to fill it up that week,
it wasn`t even empty.

03:27.807 --> 03:31.720
lt cost me
a hundred forty-eight dollars.

03:31.887 --> 03:36.039
l pushed the vehicle home.

03:36.207 --> 03:38.721
As l rolled it into
the driveway, l told my kids:

03:38.887 --> 03:42.562
``Girls, look at
our new front yard ornament.``

03:42.727 --> 03:45.764
``Get in the Prius.``

03:45.927 --> 03:48.521
``You suck, Dad!``

03:50.047 --> 03:54.199
l used to pick Priuses
out of the grill of my Hummer.

03:58.687 --> 04:02.600
During the holidays last year, we
took the Hummer in for maintenance.

04:02.767 --> 04:07.045
Then we were driving home and
my wife is behind me in the Hummer.

04:07.207 --> 04:09.277
l`m in front driving the Prius.

04:09.447 --> 04:12.803
l was tricked somehow.
l don`t know how that happened.

04:12.967 --> 04:15.765
She calls me
on the cellphone, laughing.

04:15.927 --> 04:18.885
Let me explain why.
Our Prius is not a black Prius.

04:19.047 --> 04:22.722
lt`s not a red Prius, it`s a
blue Prius. But not really blue.

04:22.887 --> 04:27.085
lt`s more of a ...blue... Prius.

04:29.767 --> 04:32.361
lt`s pretty.

04:32.527 --> 04:35.246
Sparkly!

04:35.407 --> 04:39.559
l did that
a little too well, didn`t l?

04:50.527 --> 04:57.319
While l`m driving, l`m holding in my
arm, my wife`s 3-pound Chihuahua.

04:59.607 --> 05:03.964
You have to hold it while you drive
or it`ll fall down between the seats.

05:04.127 --> 05:07.358
``Where the hell is this dog?
Oh, there you are!``

05:07.527 --> 05:12.237
``Let me put down the parking brake,
that`ll hold you, you bastard.``

05:14.287 --> 05:17.438
``l`ve got to shift... Oh!``

05:25.447 --> 05:29.918
``That was your head? l`m sorry.
l thought it was the shifty thingy.``

05:30.087 --> 05:33.966
``Same size. Leather, fur,
l don`t know the difference.``

05:34.127 --> 05:37.199
``l thought l was grinding the gears.``

05:39.727 --> 05:44.323
Thanks for laughing at that. That`s
the stupidest joke l tell all night.

05:44.487 --> 05:47.320
That morning,
l don`t know why l didn`t see it-

05:47.487 --> 05:51.605
-my children had taken
vinyl window holiday decorations-

05:51.767 --> 05:54.884
-and put them all over
the back window of the Prius.

05:55.047 --> 06:00.075
Christmas trees, Santa Claus.
Snowflakes. lt was so pretty.

06:00.247 --> 06:02.807
My wife calls me,
laughing hysterically.

06:02.967 --> 06:07.006
``What`s so funny?``
``Can you see yourself?``

06:07.167 --> 06:11.957
``You`re driving a powder blue Prius,
holding a 3-pound Chihuahua.``

06:12.127 --> 06:15.915
``There`s pretty Christmas decorations
all over your car.``

06:16.087 --> 06:20.478
``And you make a living with dolls.
You`re gay!`` - Click.

06:31.567 --> 06:35.276
And l`m like, ``Bitch!`` - click.

06:38.687 --> 06:42.726
A Chihuahua. That`s
my wife`s idea of a family pet.

06:42.887 --> 06:46.516
The dog l picked out is Bill, our
Golden Retriever. He`s 80 pounds.

06:46.687 --> 06:50.646
Now that is a dog,
ladies and gentlemen.

06:53.007 --> 06:56.522
l named him Bill because l got him
when Clinton was in office-

06:56.687 --> 07:00.043
-and as a puppy,
he was humping everything.

07:06.047 --> 07:08.117
When it comes to dogs-

07:08.287 --> 07:11.040
-l have criteria
for what is and is not a dog.

07:11.207 --> 07:18.158
Here is what is not a dog:
anything that bounces when it barks.

07:19.367 --> 07:24.361
Not a dog: anything l can easily
drop-kick over my back fence.

07:24.527 --> 07:30.318
Not a dog: anything that is regularly
terrified by a running leaf.

07:30.487 --> 07:34.878
That`s not a dog, that`s a yapping
Beanie Baby, that`s what that is.

07:35.047 --> 07:39.563
lt`s the Richard Simmons
of canines, that`s all l`m saying.

07:56.447 --> 08:00.076
``Honey, what was that?``
``l don`t know!``,

08:00.247 --> 08:03.364
Bill`s sitting next to me:
``l don`t know either!``

08:03.527 --> 08:06.564
``You`re a genius, do it again!``

08:06.727 --> 08:09.195
Size does matter
in the canine brain.

08:09.367 --> 08:12.165
Bill, Golden Retriever,
very smart animal.

08:12.327 --> 08:16.400
lf he pooped on the living room
carpet, l stuck his nose in it.

08:16.567 --> 08:20.719
Three times later, he figured out:
``l`m not supposed to crap here.``

08:20.887 --> 08:25.039
Next two dogs, same thing. Now the
brain-dead Chihuahua comes along.

08:25.207 --> 08:27.516
She poops on the carpet,
l stick her nose in it-

08:27.687 --> 08:33.842
-three times later she thinks,
``l`m not supposed to crap, ever.``

08:38.447 --> 08:43.043
And that`s why they shake.

08:53.127 --> 08:55.960
Another way Chihuahuas
prove their lack of intelligence:

08:56.127 --> 09:00.166
Most dogs know when you find a stick
in the yard and you run with it-

09:00.327 --> 09:03.524
-you put the stick
in your mouth sideways.

09:05.967 --> 09:10.677
l am not kidding. This little idiot
dog found a stick as long as she was-

09:10.847 --> 09:14.522
-and she stuck it
in her mouth straight out the front.

09:14.687 --> 09:17.645
This is all true.
We`re on the couch watching TV.

09:17.807 --> 09:21.766
She runs through the house, as
fast as she can, stick straight out.

09:21.927 --> 09:28.036
As she runs across the carpet
she decides to quickly look down.

09:28.207 --> 09:31.279
Oh yeah. Stick in the carpet,
crammed down her throat.

09:31.447 --> 09:35.281
With momentum, she
actually pole-vaulted over the stick.

09:46.007 --> 09:48.999
Of course my wife
and my girls are all...

09:49.167 --> 09:53.319
l couldn`t breathe,
l was laughing so hard.

09:53.487 --> 09:56.923
l thought, ``Damn, if she`d
been going a little faster-``

09:57.087 --> 10:01.638
``-l`d have a new puppet.
A Chihuahua on a stick!``

10:11.647 --> 10:14.844
My wife started going nuts
with the Chihuahua thing.

10:15.007 --> 10:16.998
She named her Chihuahua Darby.

10:17.167 --> 10:21.445
After a year and a half my wife
decided it was time to breed the dog.

10:21.607 --> 10:27.364
My wife got on the internet and
found the 3-pound...stud...Chihuahua.

10:27.527 --> 10:31.236
l don`t know how you call
anything that`s 3 pounds `a stud`.

10:31.407 --> 10:35.082
We picked up little Jake.
The owner wanted to get rid of him.

10:35.247 --> 10:38.717
So Jake came to live at our house.
He was full grown, ready to go.

10:38.887 --> 10:40.843
Then Darby came in heat.

10:41.007 --> 10:44.966
Not long afterthat we had
three tiny little Chihuahua puppies.

10:45.127 --> 10:49.279
The two larger ones my wife
gave away. The runt of the litter...

10:49.447 --> 10:53.759
The runt from two
3-pound dogs we decided to keep.

10:53.927 --> 10:58.159
Rusty is now full-grown,
at a whopping 1.8 pounds.

10:59.887 --> 11:03.482
The cool part is he
and 80-pound Bill are best friends.

11:03.647 --> 11:05.763
l don`t know how
you can be best friends-

11:05.927 --> 11:10.478
-with someone
who is the same size as your poop.

11:16.887 --> 11:19.606
My kids question
whether l`m funny or not.

11:19.767 --> 11:25.524
l pointed that out in the backyard
to them. l`m a comedy genius now!

11:26.767 --> 11:31.124
The cool part is little Rusty picked
me over everyone else to bond with.

11:31.287 --> 11:33.437
He likes me best,
we don`t know why. l kinda like it.

11:33.607 --> 11:35.802
l come home, he runs
to the front door, l pick him up-

11:35.967 --> 11:41.644
-take him to my office. l have a
stuffed car, he sits in that car.

11:41.807 --> 11:45.561
lf he sits just right, it looks
like he`s driving around my desk.

11:45.727 --> 11:50.403
People walk in my office,
``lt`s a rat! Oh, it`s your dog.``

11:53.087 --> 11:57.365
The bond between Rusty and me
has gone beyond just companionship.

11:57.527 --> 11:59.757
There`s an emotional bond.

11:59.927 --> 12:03.397
This has happened 5 times.
lt can`t be coincidence.

12:03.567 --> 12:06.923
The three Chihuahuas sleep
in the bed with my wife and me.

12:07.087 --> 12:10.363
My wife and l will get into
an argument, go to bed angry.

12:10.527 --> 12:14.520
You`re not supposed to do that,
but we`re tired.

12:14.687 --> 12:17.838
Rusty hears the argument, knows
we`re not happy with each other.

12:18.007 --> 12:21.044
But he takes my side.
At 3 or 4 in the morning-

12:21.207 --> 12:25.405
-he will wake up,
and pee on my wife.

12:35.127 --> 12:37.561
l am not kidding.

12:37.727 --> 12:41.242
lt`s the greatest thing ever!

12:41.407 --> 12:43.637
l have the satisfaction of knowing-

12:43.807 --> 12:48.403
-if l go to bed angry with my wife,
it`s gonna be taken care of.

12:50.007 --> 12:52.475
This is all absolutely true.

12:52.647 --> 12:56.959
l had to get up early for an
East Coast flight, about 3:30.

12:57.127 --> 13:00.164
My wife and l had argued,
l wake up still mad at her.

13:00.327 --> 13:03.205
4 am, l`m ready to walk out the door,
but l still love her.

13:03.367 --> 13:06.325
l go to kiss her.
l walk over and put my hand on her...

13:06.487 --> 13:10.196
``Rusty, my man!``

13:11.567 --> 13:15.196
lt`s still warm,
she hasn`t woken up yet.

13:15.367 --> 13:20.680
l lean over, ``l love you honey, see
you later, Rusty pissed on you. Bye!``

13:20.847 --> 13:24.283
Rusty`s at the end of the bed
just wagging his tail.

13:24.447 --> 13:29.567
l`m at the front door, ``l hope
he doesn`t teach Bill to do that.``

13:33.287 --> 13:36.518
We have three daughters.
They are 9, 11 and 15 years old.

13:36.687 --> 13:40.805
They`ve had normal childhoods.
Most things have been great.

13:40.967 --> 13:44.642
Some things have been different
because of the ventriloquism.

13:44.807 --> 13:48.561
For example,
their Barbie dolls actually speak.

13:48.727 --> 13:51.321
Not when Mommy`s around.

13:55.487 --> 14:00.197
``Ken, you smell
like beer and cigarettes.``

14:01.207 --> 14:05.325
l`m a lot of fun
at Toys `R` Us around Christmastime.

14:05.487 --> 14:11.517
Boys run to their parents, ``Mommy,
know what that Gl Joe said to me?``

14:14.287 --> 14:17.882
They will never catch me.

14:18.047 --> 14:20.561
We try to take
family walks as often as possible.

14:20.727 --> 14:23.287
On these walks,
we let one kid pick out one dog.

14:23.447 --> 14:26.883
One evening we let Kenna,
the 9-year-old, choose.

14:27.047 --> 14:32.405
Kenna seems to have
a real twisted sense of humor.

14:32.567 --> 14:36.276
We don`t know
where that came from.

14:36.447 --> 14:41.362
We have a leash. One of
those big self-retracting leashes.

14:41.527 --> 14:44.280
You push the button
and it quickly retracts.

14:44.447 --> 14:48.235
Don`t beat me to the funny part.

14:48.407 --> 14:51.638
l walk out the front door and
think l`ll be the first one there.

14:51.807 --> 14:55.356
Kenna is out front and has
Darby hooked up to that leash.

14:55.527 --> 14:59.042
She`s 2 feet away. Kenna keeps
pushing the button and letting it up.

14:59.207 --> 15:02.882
Darby is going...
l ask Kenna, ``What are you doing?``

15:03.047 --> 15:07.199
``l`m trying to
make her heel automatically.``

15:07.367 --> 15:11.679
l say, ``Kenna!
lt doesn`t work. l already tried it.``

15:11.847 --> 15:13.997
``High five.``

15:14.167 --> 15:17.079
We`re out for a walk and
Kenna has the dog at full extension.

15:17.247 --> 15:21.160
30 or 40 feet on the leash and she
hasn`t given up on what she`s trying.

15:21.327 --> 15:24.125
As we`re walking she`s
pushing the button and letting it up.

15:24.287 --> 15:26.642
Looking at the dog,
looking at the leash-

15:26.807 --> 15:28.843
-the wheels in her head turning...

15:29.007 --> 15:32.079
``What is this twisted
little child going to do?``

15:32.247 --> 15:36.126
As we`re walking, she pushed
the button. Quickly and on purpose-

15:36.287 --> 15:38.881
-dropped the leash.

15:41.807 --> 15:44.799
Do you see the brilliance here?

15:44.967 --> 15:49.836
The leash then began
to chase the Chihuahua.

16:00.767 --> 16:04.396
A big hunk of black plastic
skimmed across the pavement.

16:04.567 --> 16:07.639
The Chihuahua stopped.
She heard a new noise.

16:07.807 --> 16:11.356
She looked behind her.
Here comes the leash.

16:11.527 --> 16:13.916
At this point, the Chihuahua
is smart enough to know-

16:14.087 --> 16:17.523
-that now would be
a good time to panic.

16:17.687 --> 16:21.760
She took off like a bullet down the
street running as fast as she could.

16:21.927 --> 16:25.966
But the leash
was slightly faster.

16:26.127 --> 16:30.439
l`m standing there,
``Where`s the video camera?``

16:30.607 --> 16:33.997
``We can win 10,000 bucks!
`Watch what happens!```

16:34.167 --> 16:37.523
And sure enough...

16:37.687 --> 16:41.282
Of course my wife
and my two oldest girls...

16:41.447 --> 16:45.884
Kenna and l
are rolling in the lawn.

16:54.727 --> 16:57.764
l`m high-fiving her,
telling her she`s a genius.

16:57.927 --> 17:00.316
Mommy turns around,
sees us laughing.

17:00.487 --> 17:04.116
``Crap! Don`t look her in the eye.
Look down. Back away slowly.``

17:04.287 --> 17:07.996
``Rusty will piss on her later.``

17:14.887 --> 17:17.320
Ladies and gentlemen,
you`re an awesome audience.

17:18.406 --> 17:23.083
How about we get to the people
you came to see tonight?

17:29.087 --> 17:33.046
The first guy, l think audiences
enjoy because everyone-

17:33.207 --> 17:36.961
-knows someone like this. ln your
own family or where you work.

17:37.127 --> 17:40.119
Please help me
welcome my old friend, Walter.

18:02.327 --> 18:05.000
Get a life.

18:08.767 --> 18:12.521
-How you doing, Walter?
-What happened to your hair?

18:12.687 --> 18:15.565
Looks like
you were in a fricking car wreck.

18:15.727 --> 18:20.926
-They said it makes me look hip.
-l think it makes you look homeless.

18:21.087 --> 18:26.445
Been in D.C. fortwo days and you`re
already fricking homeless. Holy cow.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.837
-Come on, Walter, do you like D.C.?
-Oh yeah.

18:30.007 --> 18:35.525
There`s nothing quite like being
mugged in our nation`s capital.

18:35.687 --> 18:39.362
There`s a lot of excitement
that goes on in Washington, D.C.

18:39.527 --> 18:45.204
Yeah, what happens in D.C.
stays on YouTube.

18:52.607 --> 18:54.882
So you don`t like being in D.C.?

18:55.047 --> 18:57.880
No, l like it. l get screwed
on my taxes every year.

18:58.047 --> 19:03.121
So it`s fun to come visit the source.

19:04.807 --> 19:08.720
-What did you do for fun today?
-Stood in front of the lRS building.

19:08.887 --> 19:11.720
l just flipped them off.

19:18.687 --> 19:21.076
-Did you go to the White House?
-Oh yeah.

19:21.247 --> 19:24.603
That`s where the most
powerful man in the free world lives.

19:24.767 --> 19:27.964
Oprah?

19:34.447 --> 19:38.679
-What`s wrong with you tonight?
-l don`t know. l`m just pissed.

19:38.847 --> 19:41.441
-l don`t want to go home.
-Why not?

19:41.607 --> 19:44.440
l think my house is haunted.

19:44.607 --> 19:48.919
-Why do you think that?
-My wife is there.

19:53.727 --> 19:59.120
l walk in the front door
and all l hear is, ``Get out!``

20:02.247 --> 20:04.807
You got in another argument
on the phone today, didn`t you?

20:04.967 --> 20:07.356
-You heard that, did you?
-Oh yeah.

20:07.527 --> 20:12.396
Hung up on her. She called right
back, ``Did you hang up on me?``

20:12.567 --> 20:16.958
l said, ``l don`t know, did it sound
something like this?`` - Click.

20:22.847 --> 20:28.843
-Did that make her angry?
-l felt a disturbance in The Force.

20:29.007 --> 20:31.680
You ever made her that mad when
you`re standing in front of her?

20:31.847 --> 20:36.238
Yeah. My mothertold me if you`re in
a jam and don`t know what to do-

20:36.407 --> 20:40.036
-you should think,
``What would Jesus do?``

20:40.207 --> 20:43.722
So l tried to turn her into a fish.

20:46.207 --> 20:51.839
l stood there going,
``Begone, Satan!``

20:52.007 --> 20:55.886
``Hello, Shamu!``

20:57.927 --> 21:02.955
Well, at least Shamu
has only one blowhole.

21:10.287 --> 21:14.519
Aw, screw you.
That was funny.

21:19.047 --> 21:22.278
Look, it`s the ClA.

21:29.367 --> 21:32.564
l see you.

21:36.847 --> 21:40.237
We can all see you.

21:44.687 --> 21:49.636
You know, the show
looks a lot better from the front.

21:49.807 --> 21:53.163
ls the director drunk?
What the hell?

22:06.207 --> 22:09.085
What? Holy crap!

22:17.487 --> 22:20.479
Wait, come back.
Let me see in there.

22:20.647 --> 22:25.721
This is Comedy Central.
l can see Cartman.

22:25.887 --> 22:30.756
l can see Kenny.
Oh, he just got killed.

22:41.247 --> 22:43.363
You`ve been married a long time.

22:43.527 --> 22:47.076
Ups and downs in any marriage.
Ever been to marriage counseling?

22:47.247 --> 22:49.920
-Yes.
-What did that do for you?

22:50.087 --> 22:55.480
Look at me. l`m happy!

22:55.647 --> 22:58.639
Come on. What were
the results of the counseling?

22:58.807 --> 23:03.961
At the end of it all, there were
two folks who thought l was an ass.

23:04.127 --> 23:08.564
And l`m paying both of them.

23:08.727 --> 23:12.276
-But you are happy to be here?
-Oh sure. Betterthan last week.

23:12.447 --> 23:15.564
Last week? Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
You didn`t like that?

23:15.727 --> 23:22.724
No. Everyone in Fort Lauderdale,
Florida looks exactly like me.

23:30.847 --> 23:34.806
l swear, it`s like
one giant nursing home.

23:34.967 --> 23:38.357
Ft. Lauderdale is where they tape
those ``Girls Gone Wild`` videos.

23:38.527 --> 23:43.282
That`s during Spring Break. The rest
of the time it`s ``Girls Gone Saggy``.

23:45.567 --> 23:48.525
Or it`s ``Girls Gone Senile``.

23:48.687 --> 23:51.804
And then it`s just ``Girls Gone``.

23:54.287 --> 23:56.881
-You didn`t like the weather either.
-Oh my God.

23:57.047 --> 24:01.723
Even in the middle of winter,
it`s humid as hell and hot as hell.

24:01.887 --> 24:04.196
We got there,
l took a shower on Monday.

24:04.367 --> 24:07.916
Friday, still not dry.

24:08.087 --> 24:12.046
l swear, l have moss on my ass.

24:17.567 --> 24:19.956
You said
the weather changes too quickly.

24:20.127 --> 24:24.405
l know it changes fast everywhere,
but in Florida, it`s ridiculous.

24:24.567 --> 24:27.684
-What are you talking about?
-l was standing on the beach.

24:27.847 --> 24:30.645
ln the sunshine,
having a little iced tea.

24:30.807 --> 24:33.924
l looked over and go,
``Ooh, look, a little cloud.``

24:34.087 --> 24:37.716
About three minutes later...

24:37.887 --> 24:41.323
``Holy crap!``

24:41.487 --> 24:43.682
The locals are
hanging on to the palm trees.

24:43.847 --> 24:47.123
``We love it here!``

24:47.287 --> 24:49.847
You dumbasses!

24:50.007 --> 24:54.762
l say, leave it to the Cubans
and get the hell out!

25:03.367 --> 25:05.642
Alright, so you want
someplace a little cooler.

25:05.807 --> 25:08.241
Remember,
we went to Green Bay, Wisconsin.

25:08.407 --> 25:14.880
Yeah, in February! lt was negative
20 with a negative 30 wind chill.

25:15.047 --> 25:20.405
l`d get on stage every night and say,
``You people are idiots``.

25:20.567 --> 25:25.561
``Did you know
the borders are open?``

25:25.727 --> 25:29.003
``Pack up your Suburban
and get the hell out!``

25:29.167 --> 25:32.045
Another thing. Green Bay Packers
stadium, what`s it called?

25:32.207 --> 25:38.123
-Lambo Field.
-Lambo Field. No roof. Hello!

25:38.287 --> 25:42.280
How many football season weekends
have good weather in Green Bay?

25:42.447 --> 25:45.519
That would be...none.

25:45.687 --> 25:50.807
Note to self: build a fricking roof.

25:50.967 --> 25:55.836
We have the technology.

25:56.007 --> 26:00.876
Yeah, you talk to the locals
in Green Bay, what do they say?

26:01.047 --> 26:05.006
``We love it here.``

26:05.167 --> 26:08.443
``We`re a hardy people.``

26:08.607 --> 26:12.282
A bunch of frozen dumbasses,
is what you are.

26:12.447 --> 26:16.725
Walter, you don`t like humidity,
you don`t like extreme cold.

26:16.887 --> 26:18.878
You want someplace
warmer and drier.

26:19.047 --> 26:24.679
-Well in August, we were in Phoenix.
-August in Phoenix, Arizona.

26:24.847 --> 26:28.999
Your agent is a moron.

26:31.367 --> 26:34.723
lt was 112 forthree days in a row.

26:34.887 --> 26:39.517
What do all the locals say?
``But it`s a dry heat.``

26:39.687 --> 26:43.282
Screw you.

26:48.887 --> 26:52.243
A bonfire`s a dry heat.

26:52.407 --> 26:55.922
You don`t see me sticking
my ass in one of those, do you?

26:56.087 --> 27:00.444
``Your ass is on fire.``
``lt`s a dry heat!``

27:02.207 --> 27:06.803
``l was in Florida,
l gotta burn off the fricking moss!``

27:10.727 --> 27:14.436
-Did you enjoy New York City?
-Oh, l love New York City.

27:14.607 --> 27:18.885
lt was great. Do shows in Manhattan,
about midnight get back to the hotel.

27:19.047 --> 27:21.686
At 1 a.m.,
l`d lay my head on the pillow-

27:21.847 --> 27:26.716
-and listen
to the sounds of the city.

27:32.287 --> 27:34.755
Oh my God.

27:34.927 --> 27:38.602
-The city that never sleeps.
-Well, it needs a fricking nap.

27:38.767 --> 27:43.477
You`ve eliminated every corner of the
country. What about where we live?

27:43.647 --> 27:46.525
People love
the weather in Southern California.

27:46.687 --> 27:50.316
At least with Florida and hurricanes,
you get a little notice.

27:50.487 --> 27:54.321
You turn on the news: ``You have
three days to get the hell out!``

27:54.487 --> 27:56.796
-So?
-ln L.A., we`ve got earthquakes.

27:56.967 --> 27:59.401
We don`t know jack.

27:59.567 --> 28:03.799
One morning, you could be sitting
on the toilet and all of a sudden...

28:06.367 --> 28:09.962
There`s crap flying around the house.

28:10.127 --> 28:14.006
``We love it here!``

28:27.007 --> 28:29.760
You`re a dumbass, too.

28:29.927 --> 28:32.805
-Remember that last big earthquake?
-Sure.

28:32.967 --> 28:35.527
-Bad timing on that earthquake.
-How`s that?

28:35.687 --> 28:42.001
Not two seconds before it hit,
l told my grandson to pull my finger.

28:46.847 --> 28:51.318
He pulled it, l farted and
half the neighborhood fell down.

28:56.847 --> 29:01.796
That kid hasn`t come near me since.

29:01.967 --> 29:06.119
The other day l cracked my knuckles
and he dove underthe couch.

29:25.887 --> 29:30.915
-What was that?
-We`re in D.C. That was a veto.

29:39.047 --> 29:43.245
Walter, l`m listening to you and l
get the feeling we travel too much.

29:43.407 --> 29:45.398
Oh, you think?

29:45.567 --> 29:49.924
-Why don`t you like airplanes?
-l`m your carryon, for God`s sakes.

29:50.087 --> 29:54.399
l go in the x-ray machine.
l could have cancer tonight!

29:54.567 --> 29:58.401
-Tell them what happened at O`Hare.
-We`re going through the airport.

29:58.567 --> 30:01.923
l come out the other side of the
x-ray and hearthe guy say to Jeff:

30:02.087 --> 30:04.442
``Sir! l`ve got
to look inside your suitcase.``

30:04.607 --> 30:07.440
l`m lying there thinking,
``Aw crap, here we go.``

30:07.607 --> 30:10.565
Jeff`s standing there, the guy
opens the case, l pop up and go:

30:10.727 --> 30:14.356
``Hey! Shut the damned door!``

30:20.327 --> 30:25.003
Scared the crap out of the guy. Then
l thought about it a second and said:

30:25.167 --> 30:28.876
``l do not want to go to Los Angeles.``

30:36.807 --> 30:40.720
-And what happened?
-We were detained.

30:40.887 --> 30:45.722
Them bastards
have no sense of humor.

30:45.887 --> 30:48.003
They have to be
tight on security these days.

30:48.167 --> 30:50.920
l know. The terrorist threats
and all that crap.

30:51.087 --> 30:53.920
There`s one group of folks
l don`t understand at all.

30:54.087 --> 31:00.401
Damned suicide bombers.
Good God, what the hell is this?

31:05.807 --> 31:09.720
Well, way to go, habib.

31:09.887 --> 31:13.516
Bet you can`t fricking do it again.

31:26.287 --> 31:28.755
Dumbass.

31:28.927 --> 31:31.839
Walter, those guys believe
that if they martyrthemselves-

31:32.007 --> 31:35.204
-there will be 72 virgins
waiting forthem in Paradise.

31:35.367 --> 31:38.803
Well, April Fool, dumbass!

31:43.047 --> 31:48.599
lf there are virgins waiting for you,
it`ll be 72 guys just like you!

31:50.887 --> 31:54.960
``Oh no, this is not
what Osama said it would be``.

32:03.687 --> 32:09.842
72 virgins? Why not 72 slutty broads
who know what they`re doing?

32:29.287 --> 32:33.246
He had a longer fuse.

32:34.847 --> 32:39.284
l wonder if they pull that joke on
each other every once in a while.

32:39.447 --> 32:43.486
What joke?

32:46.407 --> 32:48.921
What the...

33:00.807 --> 33:03.958
``Did you see Jamil`s face?``

33:04.127 --> 33:07.244
``lt`s gone now,
but did you see his face?``

33:11.807 --> 33:16.597
72 virgins.
Sounds like a punishment to me.

33:16.767 --> 33:22.125
l gotta teach 72 women
how to have sex? Oh my God!

33:22.287 --> 33:26.075
l hope there`s no Viagra in heaven.

33:26.247 --> 33:31.241
lmpotence is God`s way of helping
a man like me to `just say no`.

33:37.127 --> 33:42.042
lf l take Viagra, it`s just to help
me keep from rolling out of bed.

33:52.807 --> 33:56.004
-Did you get that one?
-She got it!

33:57.007 --> 34:00.477
-lt`s a kickstand joke.
-Will you stop?

34:06.327 --> 34:09.399
What`re you shaking your head at?
You got a good love life?

34:09.567 --> 34:12.525
-Sure. Yeah.
-Good sex life? With your wife?

34:15.127 --> 34:17.561
-Yes.
-Good for her, too?

34:17.726 --> 34:20.560
-Yeah.
-How do you know?

34:23.087 --> 34:27.603
-What?
-How do you know?

34:29.327 --> 34:32.159
We`re waiting!

34:32.327 --> 34:36.114
Well, sometimes she calls me...

34:36.286 --> 34:38.562
...``The Hurricane``.

34:38.726 --> 34:43.039
-The what?
-``The Hurricane``.

34:43.206 --> 34:48.839
Yeah, l get it. Exciting at first,
then it ends in disaster.

34:56.047 --> 34:58.959
You know,
maybe she should call you ``FEMA``.

35:01.407 --> 35:03.477
Now what does that mean?

35:03.647 --> 35:08.357
Slow to respond and
not a lot of satisfying results.

35:11.687 --> 35:14.155
You should know.
How long have you been married?

35:14.327 --> 35:16.682
-47 years.
-That`s amazing.

35:16.847 --> 35:20.237
l know it.
That old bitch will never die.

35:21.687 --> 35:24.281
-How long you been married?
-17 years.

35:24.447 --> 35:26.677
That`s pretty good.
How do you do it?

35:26.847 --> 35:30.237
l learned a long time
ago that every couple argues.

35:30.407 --> 35:33.956
l learned that when we`re
in the middle of a big argument-

35:34.127 --> 35:36.846
-l just think of
something completely different.

35:37.007 --> 35:40.238
That takes my mind off it,
and l don`t stay angry as long.

35:40.407 --> 35:43.319
So you think of something
completely different? Like what?

35:43.487 --> 35:49.164
Oh l don`t know. Like if you choke
a Smurf, what color does it turn?

36:01.367 --> 36:03.517
-Choke a Smurf?
-Right.

36:03.687 --> 36:08.681
ls that what they`re calling it now?

36:16.207 --> 36:19.677
What the hell
happened to the chicken?

36:32.167 --> 36:35.239
Let me get back to marriage.
You`ve been married a long time.

36:35.407 --> 36:38.717
-Do you still really love your wife?
-Of course l love her.

36:38.887 --> 36:41.959
-Told her lately that you love her?
-Naw.

36:42.127 --> 36:44.197
-Why not?
-She knows it.

36:44.367 --> 36:48.042
-How does she know it?
-l smile a lot.

36:51.127 --> 36:53.595
-Have you ever cheated on her?
-No!

36:53.767 --> 36:56.281
Dammit.

36:56.447 --> 37:01.362
-Marriage is supposed to be forever.
-And this one`s taking too damn long.

37:01.527 --> 37:05.964
-Marriage is an institution.
-So is Alcatraz.

37:06.127 --> 37:08.641
You can`t compare
marriage to prison.

37:08.807 --> 37:13.597
l guess you`re right. The warden
doesn`t max out your credit cards.

37:13.767 --> 37:18.363
The other day she got me some
of that spray-on hair crap in a can.

37:18.527 --> 37:23.043
-Did you use it?
-Yeah. On your Chihuahua.

37:26.487 --> 37:29.957
Turned it into a Shi-Tzu.

37:30.127 --> 37:34.006
Your birthday wasn`t too long ago.
Did your wife get you anything?

37:34.167 --> 37:37.796
-She got me a book on reincarnation.
-Do you believe in reincarnation?

37:37.967 --> 37:40.640
-Hell, l don`t know.
-Who would you come back as?

37:40.807 --> 37:44.959
l`d come back as my wife
and leave me the hell alone.

37:49.007 --> 37:52.204
-You pick on her all the time.
-Yeah, l know.

37:52.367 --> 37:56.645
Maybe one day, l`ll be reincarnated
and come back as a sensitive guy.

37:56.807 --> 38:01.244
Driving a blue fricking Prius.

38:09.727 --> 38:14.437
-That is the saddest little vehicle.
-lt`s a great car!

38:14.607 --> 38:16.518
You ever heard it
when you`re driving by?

38:16.687 --> 38:20.157
lt goes, ``liiiiii`m gay.``

38:25.127 --> 38:28.358
``liiiiii`m gay.``

38:31.127 --> 38:34.802
When it idles it goes
``homohomohomohomo...``

38:40.967 --> 38:44.004
-ls that a new watch?
-No, l`ve had it a long time.

38:44.167 --> 38:49.764
A long time ago you had a rubber,
plastic ugly funny name thing.

38:49.927 --> 38:53.283
That was years ago
when l was in college.

38:53.447 --> 38:57.360
They were popular and might
be coming back. lt`s called a Swatch.

38:57.527 --> 38:59.677
What in the hell is a Swatch?

38:59.847 --> 39:04.284
A company in Switzerland invented
that watch, so they called it Swatch.

39:04.447 --> 39:07.325
Good thing they weren`t in Croatia.

39:16.687 --> 39:21.158
``What time is it?``, ``l don`t
know, let me look at my Crotch.``

39:25.487 --> 39:29.366
``Sorry l`m late,
but my Crotch is a little slow.``

39:29.527 --> 39:33.918
-lt`s like the Timex, it takes a ...
-Walter!

39:34.087 --> 39:37.159
That`s Walter, there we go!

39:50.727 --> 39:52.718
Thank you.

39:52.887 --> 39:57.358
As we all know, there`s a big
mess in the Middle East right now.

39:57.527 --> 39:59.643
When it comes to the terrorists-

39:59.807 --> 40:03.436
-most of us don`t understand
their extremist views and beliefs.

40:03.607 --> 40:07.964
l was thinking, how would it be
to sit and talk to one of those guys?

40:14.767 --> 40:18.442
We have that opportunity tonight.
Please help me welcome-

40:18.607 --> 40:21.280
-Achmed, the Dead Terrorist.

40:44.407 --> 40:48.082
-Good evening, Achmed.
-Good evening.

40:48.247 --> 40:51.717
lnfidel.

40:51.887 --> 40:56.199
-So you`re a terrorist.
-Yes. l am a terrorist.

40:56.367 --> 41:02.556
-What kind of terrorist?
-A terrifying...terrorist.

41:04.167 --> 41:07.682
-Are you scared?
-Not really. No.

41:11.007 --> 41:14.477
-And now?
-Not really. No.

41:18.807 --> 41:21.162
-How about now?
-No.

41:21.327 --> 41:24.205
Goddammit.

41:27.567 --> 41:30.798
l mean...uh...l mean, Allahdammit.

41:32.007 --> 41:34.202
Silence!

41:34.367 --> 41:36.961
l kill you.

41:45.767 --> 41:49.282
-So, Achmed.
-No, no. ls Achmed.

41:49.447 --> 41:53.235
-That`s what l said.
-No, you said Achmed. ls Achmed.

41:54.367 --> 41:57.006
Silence!

41:57.167 --> 42:00.159
l kill you.

42:07.487 --> 42:11.844
-How do you spell it?
-What?

42:12.007 --> 42:15.556
-How do you spell your name?
-Oh let`s see. A.

42:15.727 --> 42:17.718
C...

42:18.767 --> 42:21.759
Phlegm.

42:23.967 --> 42:27.721
Silence! l kill you.

42:35.887 --> 42:39.641
As a terrorist, l suppose
you have some sort of specialty.

42:39.807 --> 42:42.844
Yes. l am a suicide bomber.

42:43.007 --> 42:46.920
-So, you`re finished.
-What?

42:47.087 --> 42:49.920
-You`ve done your job.
-No, l haven`t.

42:50.087 --> 42:55.445
-You`re dead.
-No, l`m not. l feel fine.

42:55.607 --> 43:00.123
-But you`re all bone.
-ls a flesh wound.

43:00.287 --> 43:04.599
Silence! l kill you.

43:07.287 --> 43:11.519
What the hell happened to my feet?

43:11.687 --> 43:17.637
Son of a bitch. What the hell?
What are you doing? Stop it!

43:17.807 --> 43:22.403
What are you trying to...
Stop touching me!

43:27.887 --> 43:31.084
l kill you!

43:31.247 --> 43:33.761
-We`ll fix this.
-What are you doing? Holy crap!

43:33.927 --> 43:39.160
l`m in the air, wait wait.
Something is backwards. Holy crap.

43:39.327 --> 43:42.080
l need some ligaments.

43:42.247 --> 43:44.397
-Just sit still.
-Okay.

43:44.567 --> 43:47.798
l will not move my ass.

43:47.967 --> 43:52.597
You idiot, you don`t have an ass!

44:00.207 --> 44:02.596
-ls that Walter?
-Yeah.

44:02.767 --> 44:05.804
He scares the crap out of me.

44:07.527 --> 44:10.758
Please, do not put me
back in the same suitcase.

44:10.927 --> 44:14.886
-Why?
-He has gas!

44:15.047 --> 44:20.041
Saddam`s mustard gas was
nothing compared to a Walter fart.

44:20.207 --> 44:24.644
Ah, ha ha ha ha.

44:30.207 --> 44:35.281
lt`s not funny. He will kill us.

44:35.447 --> 44:37.722
Listen, l have something to tell you.

44:37.887 --> 44:40.640
-What?
-You really are dead.

44:40.807 --> 44:46.359
Are you sure?
l just got my flu shot.

44:46.527 --> 44:48.882
-You really are dead.
-Wait, if l`m dead...

44:49.047 --> 44:52.722
That means l get my 72 virgins.

44:55.687 --> 44:58.360
Are you my virgins?

44:58.527 --> 45:01.166
-l hope not.
-Why?

45:01.327 --> 45:05.036
There`s a bunch
of ugly-ass guys out there.

45:07.847 --> 45:11.681
lf this is Paradise,
l`ve been screwed!

45:11.847 --> 45:14.566
Did they say
it would be only female virgins?

45:14.727 --> 45:17.287
Holy crap!

45:24.887 --> 45:28.766
Wait! l can have Clay Aiken.

45:34.087 --> 45:37.318
l told a joke.

45:37.487 --> 45:43.676
-Achmed, where did you come from?
-Yourfricking suitcase.

45:43.847 --> 45:45.838
l told another one.

45:46.007 --> 45:48.077
lf you`ve been in my suitcase-

45:48.247 --> 45:51.557
-how have we been getting
through airport security?

45:51.727 --> 45:58.166
That`s easy. They open the case and
l go, ``Hello! l am Lindsay Lohan!``

46:03.167 --> 46:08.116
l told another joke!
l can do this crap too.

46:08.287 --> 46:11.324
Here`s another one.
Two Jews walk in a bar...

46:11.487 --> 46:13.842
-No. No.
-What?

46:14.007 --> 46:16.567
You don`t let Jews in your bar?

46:16.727 --> 46:19.400
You racist bastard.

46:19.567 --> 46:23.276
What l mean is,
l don`t want racist jokes in my act.

46:23.447 --> 46:26.598
Oh. Okay.
How about if l kill the Jews?

46:26.767 --> 46:29.520
l`m kidding.
l would not kill the Jews.

46:29.687 --> 46:35.444
l would toss a penny between them
and watch them fight to the death.

46:39.647 --> 46:46.166
Yes, yes. l did the same thing with
two Catholic priests and a small boy.

46:51.487 --> 46:56.356
Yes, yes. And the winner
had to fight Michael Jackson!

46:59.327 --> 47:01.682
Achmed, stop doing this!

47:01.847 --> 47:06.363
-You can`t tell jokes like that.
-Why not? l`m killing, so to speak.

47:06.527 --> 47:09.360
You can`t tell jokes like that.
lt offends people.

47:09.527 --> 47:12.724
l`m dead, what do l care?

47:12.887 --> 47:15.924
What do you want me to do,
knock-knock jokes?

47:16.087 --> 47:18.442
-lt would be better.
-Okay, knock-knock.

47:18.607 --> 47:21.440
-Who`s there?
-Me, l kill you.

47:21.607 --> 47:24.565
As a suicide bomber,
did you have training?

47:24.727 --> 47:27.924
Of course. We had
the suicide bomber training camp.

47:28.087 --> 47:32.399
-ls that a nice facility?
-lt used to be.

47:32.567 --> 47:35.764
-What happened?
-New guy!

47:35.927 --> 47:39.317
The idiot tried to practice.

47:39.487 --> 47:44.402
-What did you guys learn from that?
-Location, location, location.

47:46.527 --> 47:50.679
Do you have a motto, like...
``We`re looking for a few good men``.

47:50.847 --> 47:54.476
``We`re looking for
some idiots with no future.``

47:54.647 --> 48:00.802
-Where do you get your recruits?
-The suicide hotline.

48:03.927 --> 48:07.442
That was dark, was it not?

48:07.607 --> 48:11.282
What exactly happened to you?
What happened?

48:11.447 --> 48:16.316
lf you must know,
l am a horrible suicide bomber.

48:16.487 --> 48:21.163
-What happened?
-l had a premature detonation.

48:21.327 --> 48:26.401
l set the timerfor 30 minutes,
but it went off in 4 seconds.

48:26.567 --> 48:30.560
You know what that`s like, right?

48:36.807 --> 48:40.800
``Mr. Hurricane.``

48:42.007 --> 48:45.238
Ha ha ha ha ha.

48:47.367 --> 48:50.200
Achmed,
what exactly happened to you?

48:50.367 --> 48:54.201
l was getting gasoline
and l answered my cellphone.

48:54.367 --> 48:57.404
``Can you hear me n...?``

48:57.567 --> 49:01.799
At first, l thought it was
because l went over my minutes.

49:01.967 --> 49:07.200
lt`s okay, l took
that Verizon bastard with me.

49:14.447 --> 49:17.484
What`s it like to die?
Do you see a white light?

49:17.647 --> 49:20.844
lf you`re dumb enough
to watch the explosion, yes.

49:21.007 --> 49:24.522
Some people say when they die they
see a white light. What did you see?

49:24.687 --> 49:26.882
l saw flying car parts...

49:27.047 --> 49:29.641
What was the last thing
through your mind?

49:29.807 --> 49:32.799
My ass.

49:34.087 --> 49:37.204
Waltertold me to tell that joke.

49:37.367 --> 49:44.125
-You never saw a white light?
-No, but l saw a blue Prius.

49:46.167 --> 49:49.762
Do you really
have one of those vehicles?

49:51.127 --> 49:54.756
That is not a car.
That`s a lunchbox.

49:54.927 --> 49:58.476
Did you know, when you`re
going down the highway in a Prius-

49:58.647 --> 50:03.596
-if you put your hand out the window,
the vehicle will turn?

50:03.767 --> 50:06.725
-You did this for a bunch of virgins?
-Are you kidding me?

50:06.887 --> 50:10.846
l`d kill you for a Klondike bar.

50:12.047 --> 50:15.198
-So, l guess you are Muslim?
-l don`t think so, no.

50:15.367 --> 50:20.122
Look at my ass. ``Made in China``.

50:20.287 --> 50:25.645
Walter says l`m just a
stinking Halloween decoration.

50:28.487 --> 50:32.116
-Do you like being in D.C.?
-l think some idiots must live here.

50:32.287 --> 50:35.279
-Why?
-The Washington Monument.

50:35.447 --> 50:40.601
-Yes?
-lt looks nothing like the guy.

50:40.767 --> 50:45.921
lt looks more like
a tribute to Bill Clinton.

50:52.167 --> 50:54.442
-What do you think of Bush?
-Oh, l love bush.

50:54.607 --> 50:57.440
Oh, you mean
the President. l`m sorry!

50:57.607 --> 51:01.077
That`s Achmed,
the Dead Terrorist! There we go.

51:08.567 --> 51:13.243
Thank you. There`s never been
a bettertime than right now-

51:13.287 --> 51:15.403
-to introduce
a brand new superhero.

51:15.527 --> 51:17.518
We have that very thing this evening.

51:17.687 --> 51:20.247
He`s big. He`s powerful.
Please help me welcome-

51:20.407 --> 51:25.003
-the superhero...Melvin.

51:32.407 --> 51:36.400
H...h... Hi!

51:36.567 --> 51:38.558
-Good to see you, Melvin.
-Thank you.

51:38.727 --> 51:42.640
lt`s nice being here
in our nation`s capital.

51:42.807 --> 51:46.766
So, you`re a superhero. What is
your most outstanding feature?

51:49.567 --> 51:52.320
My costume.

51:52.487 --> 51:54.955
-lt`s a very nice costume.
-Thank you.

51:55.127 --> 51:58.483
-What does the `D` stand for?
-Oh, that`s my theme song.

51:58.647 --> 52:04.040
-What`s your theme song?
-Da da-da daa!

52:04.207 --> 52:08.962
-Where did you get the costume?
-That is a superhero secret!

52:09.127 --> 52:11.925
-EBay?
-Dammit!

52:12.087 --> 52:16.285
-How did you deduce that?
-A tag on the back says EBay.

52:16.447 --> 52:19.484
lt`s as plain as the nose...
Oops, sorry.

52:19.647 --> 52:23.401
Okay, so you`re a superhero.
Do you fight crime?

52:23.567 --> 52:26.127
-Yes, of course!
-What kind of crime?

52:26.287 --> 52:28.676
Bad kind.

52:28.847 --> 52:34.080
-So what have you done lately?
-Today, l was battling a terrorist.

52:34.247 --> 52:37.045
-Achmed?
-Yes.

52:37.207 --> 52:41.598
-And what kind of battle?
-Checkers.

52:43.647 --> 52:48.118
Every time l`d get a king,
he`d blow it up.

52:48.287 --> 52:51.597
-So what did you do?
-l issued a verbal threat.

52:51.767 --> 52:56.124
And then Walter gassed him.

53:03.647 --> 53:06.480
-Melvin, do you have any powers?
-Yes!

53:06.647 --> 53:09.798
-Like what?
-l can fly. Really far.

53:09.967 --> 53:15.087
-How far?
-How far can you throw me?

53:15.247 --> 53:18.683
-Do you have other powers?
-X-ray vision!

53:18.847 --> 53:21.998
Can you see through
something practical, like clothes?

53:22.167 --> 53:25.318
Oh, you`re sick.

53:25.487 --> 53:28.126
Yes.

53:28.287 --> 53:31.996
l love looking at boobies.

53:34.807 --> 53:38.880
That`s a beautiful pair, isn`t it?

53:39.047 --> 53:44.644
l`m glad l`m wearing loose shorts.

53:44.807 --> 53:52.487
Oh, l forgot.
l can`t see through silicone.

53:52.647 --> 53:56.925
What? They`re good.
Those are super-hooters.

53:57.087 --> 54:01.603
lf she had a theme song,
it would be Ta ta-ta taa!

54:05.927 --> 54:11.479
lf she had a costume,
she`d have two Ds on her chest.

54:11.647 --> 54:14.684
-l can look but l can`t touch.
-Why?

54:14.847 --> 54:17.998
l`m lactose intolerant.

54:18.167 --> 54:23.195
You can fly and have x-ray vision.
Those are the same as Superman!

54:23.367 --> 54:28.157
-Can you stop a speeding bullet?
-Once.

54:31.527 --> 54:36.078
Shut up! lt hurts like hell.

54:36.247 --> 54:38.761
Can you leap
tall buildings in a single bound?

54:38.927 --> 54:43.637
Why the hell would l do that?
There`s not a lot of call for that.

54:43.807 --> 54:47.402
-Superman does that.
-Show-off.

54:47.567 --> 54:51.845
He could avoid all the fuss and
just walk around the effing thing.

54:53.087 --> 54:57.444
l can`t curse.
l think the President should.

54:57.607 --> 55:00.565
-The President?
-Yeah. Think about it.

55:00.727 --> 55:07.326
We had the A-bomb, the H-bomb.
lt`s time for him to drop the F-bomb.

55:15.367 --> 55:19.280
He could go,
``Hey, terrorists! F you!``

55:19.447 --> 55:22.917
So, like Superman, do you
change clothes in a phone booth?

55:23.087 --> 55:25.282
What?

55:25.447 --> 55:29.645
-Superman does that too.
-He`s got issues, doesn`t he?

55:29.807 --> 55:32.605
My wife met Lois Lane once.

55:32.767 --> 55:37.158
She said she acted
like an H-O-R-E.

55:37.327 --> 55:39.966
You mean a W-H-O-R-E.

55:40.127 --> 55:46.839
What`s a `w-hore`?
ls that like a Klingon?

55:47.007 --> 55:49.726
So you`re married.
Does your wife have any powers?

55:49.887 --> 55:51.798
-Yes.
-Like what?

55:51.967 --> 55:55.801
Once a month...

55:57.287 --> 56:00.438
She becomes evil.

56:00.607 --> 56:03.679
And l cannot defeat her.

56:03.847 --> 56:09.205
Our children run in terror.
Our big dog cowers underthe couch.

56:09.367 --> 56:13.963
-You have a big dog?
-Actually, l borrowed your Chihuahua.

56:14.127 --> 56:19.326
Superman has a dog, Krypto. He has
all the same powers as Superman.

56:19.487 --> 56:22.843
That`s ridiculous.
lf Krypto sniffs your crotch-

56:23.007 --> 56:26.841
-he`ll suck your lungs out your ass.

56:28.607 --> 56:33.078
lf he humps your leg,
you`ll be in traction for a year.

56:33.247 --> 56:39.482
-Do you have an arch enemy?
-Pinocchio.

56:39.647 --> 56:42.684
-Do you have a weakness?
-Cupcakes.

56:42.847 --> 56:46.726
And porn.

56:46.887 --> 56:50.880
What? Not at the same time.

56:51.047 --> 56:55.404
l need a free hand.

57:01.327 --> 57:04.364
So, when there`s a problem,
how are you summoned?

57:04.527 --> 57:08.076
l`m making a deal with
the Commissioner to light up the sky-

57:08.247 --> 57:10.761
-with a spotlight of my symbol.

57:10.927 --> 57:15.045
-What`s your symbol?
-A big nose in the sky.

57:15.207 --> 57:20.156
Trouble is, sometimes it
doesn`t exactly look like a nose.

57:27.007 --> 57:31.205
lt`s not a cupcake, either.

57:31.367 --> 57:34.359
Da da-da daa!

57:34.527 --> 57:36.518
Are you friends
with other superheroes?

57:36.687 --> 57:38.962
-Some of them.
-How about Aquaman?

57:39.127 --> 57:42.483
l like Aquaman, he can
breathe underwater and talk to fish.

57:42.647 --> 57:47.482
Yeah, great. He has all
the same powers as SpongeBob.

57:49.047 --> 57:51.322
-How about the Hulk?
-Why do you like the Hulk?

57:51.487 --> 57:53.717
The angrier he gets,
the stronger he gets.

57:53.887 --> 57:58.517
Yeah, like
every white trash guy on Cops .

58:02.967 --> 58:06.846
-l like the Flash.
-He has no powers!

58:07.007 --> 58:10.079
He`s on meth.

58:10.247 --> 58:13.876
-Catwoman?
-l used to date Catwoman.

58:14.047 --> 58:19.724
She gave me something
l had to take medicine to get rid of.

58:19.887 --> 58:22.924
And boy, does it itch.

58:23.087 --> 58:26.523
And now it burns when l fly.

58:26.687 --> 58:30.043
Da da-da daa...

58:45.767 --> 58:49.316
Son of a bitch!

58:49.487 --> 58:52.923
lt`s the terrorists, l tell you.

58:56.527 --> 59:00.122
l look like Lex Luthor.

59:00.287 --> 59:05.281
-Can you put it back?
-Sure. Here we go.

59:05.447 --> 59:09.918
-How`s that?
-Da da-da daa.

59:17.487 --> 59:20.559
That kinda sucked.

59:20.727 --> 59:25.357
-Do superheroes date each other?
-We date mortals sometimes, too.

59:25.527 --> 59:29.998
Did you know that Superman
was dating Rosie O`Donnell?

59:30.167 --> 59:32.203
-l did not know that.
-He had to quit.

59:32.367 --> 59:35.518
Because she got too big.

59:35.687 --> 59:40.158
He took her on one flight
and threw out his back.

59:40.327 --> 59:44.036
Embarrassing when you`re
flying a girl around Metropolis-

59:44.207 --> 59:47.802
-and yourfeet
are still dragging the sidewalk.

59:52.487 --> 59:55.763
Da da-da daa.

59:55.927 --> 01:00:00.796
This looks like a job for Slim-Fast!

01:00:03.287 --> 01:00:06.165
-One last guy, how about Batman?
-Oh.

01:00:06.327 --> 01:00:10.764
A grown man in a rubber suit,
running around with a young boy?

01:00:10.927 --> 01:00:16.047
l don`t have to have x-ray vision to
see what the hell`s going on there.

01:00:16.207 --> 01:00:20.120
l wondered about these superheroes
and their young men sidekicks.

01:00:24.647 --> 01:00:29.437
You have five men in a suitcase.

01:00:29.607 --> 01:00:33.566
And one of them`s on a stick.

01:00:42.367 --> 01:00:46.599
Who is sliding down
the proverbial Batpole now?

01:00:46.767 --> 01:00:51.887
lf you had a theme song,
it would be La la-la laa.

01:00:52.047 --> 01:00:57.963
-You know, l have a wife and kids.
-So does Tom Cruise!

01:00:59.007 --> 01:01:02.044
And that`s Melvin the Superhero.
There we go.

01:01:07.527 --> 01:01:09.916
Thank you.

01:01:15.167 --> 01:01:18.079
Thank you so much.

01:01:18.247 --> 01:01:22.206
lf you`ve seen my show before,
you`ll recognize this next guy.

01:01:22.367 --> 01:01:25.518
Please help me welcome
my buddy, Peanut.

01:01:36.087 --> 01:01:38.476
-How you doing, Peanut?
-Pretty good, how are you?

01:01:38.647 --> 01:01:42.526
-l`m fine.
-That`s good, that`s gooooooood.

01:01:43.887 --> 01:01:48.119
-So, you like it here?
-Oh, l love being in D.C.

01:01:48.287 --> 01:01:53.839
D.C! lt`s great. And l love this
theater, the Warner Theater.

01:01:54.007 --> 01:01:56.760
lt`s fantastic.
And they`ve got a cool website.

01:01:56.927 --> 01:01:59.964
And a link to our website
which is jeffdunham.com.

01:02:00.127 --> 01:02:02.846
-The thing that...
-Peanut, stop...

01:02:03.007 --> 01:02:06.238
What?

01:02:06.407 --> 01:02:11.720
The hell is wrong with you?
We cannot talk at the same time!

01:02:18.847 --> 01:02:22.157
l talk, you talk.
l talk, you talk, that`s it!

01:02:22.327 --> 01:02:26.081
Focus.

01:02:29.727 --> 01:02:32.844
l am so sick of this crap.

01:02:33.007 --> 01:02:37.000
-l have tried going solo.
-What happened?

01:02:37.167 --> 01:02:42.036
l kept falling off
this fricking thing.

01:02:42.207 --> 01:02:44.277
Why did you interrupt me?

01:02:44.447 --> 01:02:48.076
-You mispronounced my last name.
-l know.

01:02:48.247 --> 01:02:52.320
-lt`s Dunham.
-Not when you look at it. Dun-Ham.

01:02:52.487 --> 01:02:55.285
Haaaaaam.

01:02:55.447 --> 01:02:59.042
You`re the other white meat.

01:03:02.367 --> 01:03:04.676
Don`t confuse everyone. lt`s Dunham.

01:03:04.847 --> 01:03:07.156
lt says Dun-ham ham ham ham.

01:03:15.687 --> 01:03:20.715
Jeff Dun Ham. Dot Com.

01:03:20.887 --> 01:03:25.677
Jeff Dun Ham. Dot Com.

01:03:29.847 --> 01:03:35.319
And when you think about it for
30 seconds, it`s Jefa Fa Dun Ham.

01:03:36.327 --> 01:03:38.363
Dot Com.

01:03:38.527 --> 01:03:42.520
Jefa Fa.
You`re using an unneeded `F`.

01:03:42.687 --> 01:03:47.841
Jefa Fa. Dun Ham.

01:03:48.007 --> 01:03:50.919
Dot Com.

01:03:54.487 --> 01:03:58.878
Am l pissing you ofa fa?

01:04:08.287 --> 01:04:10.755
Jefa Fa?

01:04:10.927 --> 01:04:15.443
Dun Ham. Dot Com.

01:04:15.607 --> 01:04:20.965
The weird part is,
l am actually pissing him off.

01:04:21.127 --> 01:04:24.961
And he would like to kill me.
But he will not-

01:04:25.127 --> 01:04:29.120
-because that would be
a form of suicide.

01:04:30.607 --> 01:04:32.677
-You want to kill me.
-No, l don`t.

01:04:32.847 --> 01:04:38.797
Yes, yes, yes.
Search yourfeelings, Jefa Fa.

01:04:42.607 --> 01:04:46.839
Dun Ham. Dot Com.

01:04:57.327 --> 01:05:01.639
-What?
-Dude, you need a Tic-Tac.

01:05:06.727 --> 01:05:11.084
You know what your breath
smells like? Done ham.

01:05:12.927 --> 01:05:14.918
Dot Com.

01:05:18.847 --> 01:05:21.281
What the hell was that?

01:05:21.447 --> 01:05:23.677
-What?
-What did you just do?

01:05:23.847 --> 01:05:27.476
-l didn`t do anything.
-You picked your nose.

01:05:27.647 --> 01:05:33.119
Did you see that?
- Oh my God.

01:05:33.287 --> 01:05:38.236
You fricking picked...your nose!

01:05:52.287 --> 01:05:56.121
-What?
-You didn`t do a very good job!

01:06:05.647 --> 01:06:08.719
-There`s still something there.
-Cut it out!

01:06:08.887 --> 01:06:11.959
-You gotta get it. lt`s wiggling.
-Stop it!

01:06:12.127 --> 01:06:17.326
Oh wait! You`re a ventriloquist.
Make it talk.

01:06:21.247 --> 01:06:26.605
That`d be funny as hell!
Only give it a French accent.

01:06:26.767 --> 01:06:32.364
``Bonjour! l would like to
come out of your nose!``

01:06:36.327 --> 01:06:38.557
Stop it.

01:06:53.927 --> 01:06:56.680
Holy crap, you`re quick.

01:06:56.847 --> 01:07:01.159
lt`s like you know.

01:07:18.247 --> 01:07:21.080
You do that now, you just go...

01:07:21.247 --> 01:07:26.640
-That`s always been yourthing.
-You do it. Short one, long one.

01:07:26.807 --> 01:07:29.719
Do it!

01:07:35.967 --> 01:07:38.765
Do it.

01:07:42.567 --> 01:07:48.881
What the hell was that? You
sound like some anemic French guy.

01:07:52.127 --> 01:07:54.721
German: jawohl !

01:07:54.887 --> 01:07:58.197
Chinese:

01:07:58.367 --> 01:08:00.961
Gay guy:

01:08:07.647 --> 01:08:12.846
Oh, oh! Wait, wait.
A guy driving a blue Prius:

01:08:21.487 --> 01:08:24.001
You know what
would be funny as hell?

01:08:24.167 --> 01:08:30.322
When this gets on Comedy Central,
if the show is sponsored by Toyota.

01:08:34.447 --> 01:08:37.883
And they have no idea.

01:08:38.046 --> 01:08:42.006
One night
they`re watching this like, ``Hey!``

01:08:42.167 --> 01:08:46.877
``He making fun of our cars!``

01:08:51.846 --> 01:08:55.044
``He say our car is gay.``

01:08:55.207 --> 01:08:58.323
``lt not gay, he gay.``

01:08:58.487 --> 01:09:01.001
``Let`s get Godzilla to kill him.``

01:09:12.527 --> 01:09:15.439
-lt`s a tiny little car, isn`t it?
-lt`s small.

01:09:15.607 --> 01:09:21.238
l bet to get in and out,
you gotta use a lot of lotion.

01:09:35.846 --> 01:09:40.398
-That`s not funny.
-They are laughing like hell.

01:09:42.287 --> 01:09:45.085
-Does your wife drive that car?
-The Prius? Oh, sure.

01:09:45.247 --> 01:09:48.000
-Good. How`s she doing?
-My wife? She`s fine.

01:09:48.167 --> 01:09:50.805
-Oh, good. How`s the family?
-They`re fine.

01:09:50.966 --> 01:09:55.358
-Oh, good! l was just wondering.
-Thanks a lot.

01:09:55.527 --> 01:09:57.518
-Everything`s fine?
-Everything`s fine.

01:09:57.687 --> 01:10:02.841
l just want to make sure.
Because l`m your pal.

01:10:03.007 --> 01:10:06.716
-Thank you.
-So l`m concerned.

01:10:06.887 --> 01:10:11.597
-About what?
-l was just thinking the other day.

01:10:11.767 --> 01:10:17.637
We`re on the road a lot.
You`re away from home a lot.

01:10:17.807 --> 01:10:22.039
And your wife`s at home alone. A lot.

01:10:22.207 --> 01:10:26.086
-Okay?
-Yeah.

01:10:26.247 --> 01:10:30.035
-She`s not exactly bad-looking.
-No.

01:10:30.207 --> 01:10:32.846
She`s hot.

01:10:34.287 --> 01:10:38.360
And her prime is now.

01:10:38.527 --> 01:10:43.555
Yours was 20 years ago.

01:10:48.967 --> 01:10:52.755
And she`s home. Alone.

01:10:52.927 --> 01:10:55.646
Are you sure?

01:10:55.807 --> 01:10:59.925
-Yeah.
-How do you know?

01:11:00.087 --> 01:11:04.000
l trust her.

01:11:05.887 --> 01:11:08.765
What if she`s been
with someone else?

01:11:08.927 --> 01:11:11.919
Like...me!

01:11:12.087 --> 01:11:15.966
Oh, come on.
You go purple, you never go back!

01:11:21.247 --> 01:11:24.125
l really don`t think my wife
has slept with you, Peanut.

01:11:24.287 --> 01:11:28.678
Well, think about this for a second.
ln a twisted kind of way-

01:11:28.847 --> 01:11:33.557
-all five of us on stage
have slept with your wife.

01:11:35.807 --> 01:11:38.765
When you`re wacky and
having a great time, that`s me!

01:11:38.927 --> 01:11:41.236
When you`re pissed off,
lying there thinking-

01:11:41.407 --> 01:11:46.356
-``why did l marry this broad?``,
that`s Walter.

01:11:46.527 --> 01:11:51.123
When you`re so angry
you want to kill her, that`s Achmed.

01:11:51.287 --> 01:11:54.484
So what is Jose Jalapeno on a Stick?

01:11:54.647 --> 01:11:58.162
You`re a sick man!

01:11:58.327 --> 01:12:02.206
And here he is,
Jose Jalapeno on a Stick!

01:12:11.407 --> 01:12:16.197
-Good evening, Jose.
-Hola, Senor Heff.

01:12:16.367 --> 01:12:20.155
-lt`s good to see you.
-Gracias, Senor Heff.

01:12:20.327 --> 01:12:23.524
-Excuse me! Who the hell is `Heff`?
-That`s Jeff.

01:12:23.687 --> 01:12:26.281
-No, he said `Heff`.
-lt`s the same thing.

01:12:26.447 --> 01:12:28.802
No, it`s not.

01:12:28.967 --> 01:12:31.765
-Jose, what did you say?
-l say Senor Heff.

01:12:31.927 --> 01:12:34.805
What the f...Now he said `Cheff`.

01:12:34.967 --> 01:12:39.643
-lt`s all the same.
-Didn`t you watch Sesame Street?

01:12:39.807 --> 01:12:43.846
Jeff is Jeff, Heff is Heff
and Cheff is Cheff.

01:12:44.007 --> 01:12:48.285
One of these things
just doesnt belong here!

01:12:55.647 --> 01:13:00.277
Tonight`s show is
sponsored by the sound chhhhhh.

01:13:00.447 --> 01:13:04.998
-l`m sorry, Jose.
-ls okay. He`s an idiot.

01:13:05.167 --> 01:13:12.278
You`re on a stick.
Stica ka. Jefa fa.

01:13:14.807 --> 01:13:18.595
l have a question for Josie.

01:13:26.247 --> 01:13:28.681
My name is Jose.

01:13:28.847 --> 01:13:35.036
Oh, l`m sorry, l thought we were in
America, speaking fricking English.

01:13:35.207 --> 01:13:39.325
But l didn`t see
the little...overthe `e`.

01:13:39.487 --> 01:13:43.878
Which magically
changes Josie into fricking Jose.

01:13:44.047 --> 01:13:46.720
And l didn`t see the...over the `n`-

01:13:46.887 --> 01:13:50.960
-which changes
jalapeno into jalapeno.

01:13:51.127 --> 01:13:53.322
So a...overthe `n`
and a...over the `e`.

01:13:53.487 --> 01:13:59.437
Two keys l can never
fricking find on a fricking keyboard.

01:14:02.887 --> 01:14:06.766
Apparently it`s a secret
known only to the Mexicans.

01:14:06.927 --> 01:14:11.717
So, Jose, when you`re typing...
Oh! l`m sorry.

01:14:17.407 --> 01:14:21.878
Talk about `hunt and peck`.

01:14:22.047 --> 01:14:27.644
-l`m sorry, Jose.
-ls OK. l`ll hire Achmed to kill him.

01:14:27.807 --> 01:14:30.799
So, what`s your question?
And be nice.

01:14:30.967 --> 01:14:35.643
-You`re a jalapeno.
- Si, senor. On a stick.

01:14:35.807 --> 01:14:40.039
-You`re a Mexican jalapeno.
-On a stick.

01:14:40.207 --> 01:14:43.643
Are you a legal Mexican jalapeno?

01:14:45.687 --> 01:14:49.441
-What? What did l say?
-This is not the appropriate time.

01:14:49.607 --> 01:14:55.079
Too late! So, Jose, are you legal?
Are you legal, legal, legal, lega...?

01:14:57.767 --> 01:15:00.486
-What?
-l know the answer to the question.

01:15:00.647 --> 01:15:02.638
Jose? Are you legal
to be in this country?

01:15:02.807 --> 01:15:05.958
Si, senor.
l have my green card.

01:15:06.127 --> 01:15:11.440
-Where is your green card?
-lt`s in my other stick.

01:15:14.767 --> 01:15:18.965
-Did you know he had another stick?
-l had no idea.

01:15:19.127 --> 01:15:25.521
You know what that means?
That means that one comes out!

01:15:37.967 --> 01:15:43.678
Oh my God! l thought
it was just stuck up his ass.

01:15:43.847 --> 01:15:47.123
-What`s wrong?
-He doesn`t have an ass.

01:15:47.287 --> 01:15:49.278
-lt`s just a jalapeno.
-On a stick.

01:15:49.447 --> 01:15:51.722
l know!

01:15:51.887 --> 01:15:54.321
-How did he get on the stick?
-l don`t know.

01:15:54.487 --> 01:15:57.638
Probably a horrible pogo accident.

01:15:57.807 --> 01:16:01.197
You know...doink doink.

01:16:03.367 --> 01:16:06.564
Ole!

01:16:12.647 --> 01:16:16.083
Jose, immigration is a
big topic in the country right now.

01:16:16.247 --> 01:16:19.762
Would you mind
if l ask a few questions?

01:16:19.927 --> 01:16:23.681
There are more National Guard on
the border between USA and Mexico.

01:16:23.847 --> 01:16:25.838
-Does this concern you?
-No, senor.

01:16:26.007 --> 01:16:30.683
-Why not?
-He`s already here!

01:16:33.527 --> 01:16:37.076
You really are an idiot!

01:16:37.247 --> 01:16:41.479
Jose, are you here on a
temporary visa, or on a work visa?

01:16:41.647 --> 01:16:45.356
He`s here on a stick.

01:16:48.007 --> 01:16:52.205
-Do you enjoy being in this country?
-Sometimes l`m afraid for my life.

01:16:52.367 --> 01:16:55.962
-Why?
-Taco Bell.

01:17:03.287 --> 01:17:06.359
-Jose, do you have a new girlfriend?
- Si, senor.

01:17:06.527 --> 01:17:10.440
-What, a fricking pickle on a pencil?
-Stop it!

01:17:13.687 --> 01:17:15.962
-Peanut, are you prejudiced?
-No!

01:17:16.127 --> 01:17:21.326
A bunch of
my best friends are on sticks.

01:17:21.487 --> 01:17:24.001
Peanut, l meant are you
prejudiced towards Mexicans?

01:17:24.167 --> 01:17:28.479
No. My mother`s Mexican.

01:17:30.807 --> 01:17:34.083
Okay, l meant New Mexican.

01:17:34.247 --> 01:17:38.001
She`s like Jose, just...fresher.

01:17:38.167 --> 01:17:41.682
-Jose, you speak English very well.
-Gracias, senor.

01:17:41.847 --> 01:17:45.283
What were some of the first phrases
in English that you learned?

01:17:45.447 --> 01:17:49.122
``Will you help me push my car?``

01:18:01.527 --> 01:18:05.406
-``Does this lD look real?``
-Will you s...

01:18:05.567 --> 01:18:10.163
-``Where`s the nearest Home Depot?``
-Stop it!

01:18:10.327 --> 01:18:14.923
Actually, the last one was true.

01:18:15.087 --> 01:18:18.477
l`m sorry about this, Jose.
l`m happy to have you in the act.

01:18:18.647 --> 01:18:20.763
- Gracias, senor.
-Just make sure he`s legal.

01:18:20.927 --> 01:18:25.239
-He`s legal. Why are you concerned?
-Are you not concerned?

01:18:25.407 --> 01:18:29.685
-Why should l be concerned?
-He works for you!

01:18:29.847 --> 01:18:34.318
Some of those laws pass and he`s not
legal, it`s your ass thrown in jail.

01:18:34.487 --> 01:18:37.718
And trust me,
you would not do well in prison.

01:18:37.887 --> 01:18:42.085
-Why not?
-``Come here, puppet boy!``

01:18:49.447 --> 01:18:53.235
``Make your daddy talk.``

01:18:53.407 --> 01:18:57.525
That`s nice. So you`re pretty sure
l`d soon become someone`s...

01:18:57.687 --> 01:18:59.882
-Bitch.
-Right.

01:19:00.047 --> 01:19:02.197
On a stick.

01:19:02.367 --> 01:19:08.920
You guys have been an awesome
audience. Thank you. Good night.
