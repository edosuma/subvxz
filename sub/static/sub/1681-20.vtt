00:02.400 --> 00:04.681
Ah, Ah, Lily, I heard this
great joke at work today.

00:04.701 --> 00:06.320
Dude, come on. She's not gonna like it.

00:06.330 --> 00:08.431
It's boy-funny.
It's not girl-funny.

00:08.441 --> 00:12.431
That is sexist! Funny is funny, Ted.

00:12.441 --> 00:14.431
Lily's cool.She'll appreciate this .

00:14.441 --> 00:16.030
Oh, you're on your own, man.

00:16.059 --> 00:18.020
Just tell me the joke.

00:18.030 --> 00:19.457
Okay. Ready?

00:19.467 --> 00:24.824
Lily, what's the difference
between peanut butter and jam?

00:25.267 --> 00:26.845
- See? It's funny.
- It's boy-funny.

00:26.855 --> 00:28.121
She's not gonna like it.

00:28.151 --> 00:30.674
- Why don't you let me decide?
- No.

00:30.684 --> 00:33.729
What's the difference
between peanut butter and jam?

00:35.630 --> 00:37.640
And then Barney said the punch line.

00:37.670 --> 00:41.368
To this day, it's still the dirtiest
joke I've ever heard in my life.

00:41.398 --> 00:43.691
And no, I'm not gonna say it.

00:44.414 --> 00:47.480
Yeah, I can't hang out with you anymore.

00:47.490 --> 00:52.827
Oh, come on. That's
a funny joke. That...

00:52.837 --> 00:54.425
Told you.

00:54.455 --> 00:56.284
She'll be back.

00:56.325 --> 00:59.671
And we didn't see Lily for four weeks.

00:59.842 --> 01:04.185

<font color=#EAADEA>How I Met Your
Mother Season04 Episode20</font>

01:13.241 --> 01:17.442
Kids, after getting laid off, I was
finay pursuing my lifelong dream:

01:17.482 --> 01:19.543
starting my own architecture firm.

01:19.573 --> 01:21.332
All I needed was some clients.

01:21.362 --> 01:24.166
I think it's so great that you're
striking out on your own, Ted.

01:24.196 --> 01:26.076
- I admire that.
- Thanks.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.469
And, uh, thanks for being so
cool with me using the apartment.

01:28.499 --> 01:31.132
Oh, yeah, of course. Anything you need.

01:32.016 --> 01:34.911
Hey, small thing-- do you mind not
watching television during business hours?

01:34.941 --> 01:36.077
This isn't working!

01:36.097 --> 01:39.696
I'm sorry. It's just, I... I can't
concentrate while Wheel of Fortune is...

01:39.706 --> 01:42.690
A penny saved is a Penny Marshall! Yes!

01:42.701 --> 01:45.978
Ted, I know you're nervous, but
you've got to stop procrastinating.

01:45.998 --> 01:50.912
You've spent the last two days choosing
the official pen of Mosbius Designs.

01:50.933 --> 01:53.073
Hey, I've made some progress, huh?

01:53.103 --> 01:55.727
I've eliminated felt-tip.

01:55.989 --> 01:59.557
Oh, who am I kidding?
Felt's back in the ballgame.

02:01.778 --> 02:02.984
You hear there's gonna be more layoffs?

02:03.004 --> 02:05.296
I know. I'm f... I'm freaking out.

02:05.306 --> 02:07.738
- Are you worried?
- Aryou kidding?

02:07.748 --> 02:09.507
The things I know about this company.

02:09.537 --> 02:11.336
I won't ever be fired.

02:11.356 --> 02:14.865
I mean, there's a pretty good chance one day I'll
wash up on shore with no fingerprints or teeth,

02:14.875 --> 02:16.774
but I won't be fired.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.845
Well, I wish I had your confidence.

02:19.307 --> 02:22.564
Look, you just need a way to make
yourself absolutely essential.

02:22.584 --> 02:24.926
Well, I-I work harder
than anyone in my division.

02:24.936 --> 02:28.031
Yeah. Keeping your job has
nothing to do with hard work.

02:28.313 --> 02:30.373
- You need a thing.
- What do you mean, a thing?

02:30.383 --> 02:34.927
You know, something that makes you fun
and well-liked, like Marcus Denisco.

02:34.937 --> 02:40.264
Marcus Denisco worked in account services and was
perhaps the most expendable employee at the company.

02:40.274 --> 02:43.179
I brought some donuts.
They're probably stupid.

02:43.189 --> 02:45.500
But eventually, he
came to be known as...

02:45.530 --> 02:47.169
Food Guy!

02:47.179 --> 02:50.044
Who wants some pulled pork?
Of course you do! Come on!

02:51.109 --> 02:52.798
I love Food Guy.

02:52.818 --> 02:54.175
They could never lay him off.

02:54.185 --> 02:56.164
You know what I love about Food Guy?

02:56.174 --> 02:58.497
- He always has food.
- He always has food.

02:58.507 --> 03:00.175
See? That's what you need.

03:00.185 --> 03:03.010
You need that thing
that makes you a guy.

03:03.060 --> 03:05.964
Oh, I have that thing
that makes me a guy.

03:05.974 --> 03:08.257
Maybe even a guy and a half.

03:08.267 --> 03:12.337
Not that thing. You know,
a thing. Like Toy Guy.

03:12.347 --> 03:14.186
Guys, bad news.

03:14.226 --> 03:19.172
As your HR rep, I got to review the
new overtime scheduling policy with you.

03:19.182 --> 03:23.785
The good news is we're gonna do
it while wearing Wolverine claws!

03:26.238 --> 03:30.409
Section 5A: Overtime will no
longer be paid at time and a half.

03:30.439 --> 03:32.319
- This is awesome!
- Claw five!

03:34.199 --> 03:35.656
Oh, I love Toy Guy.

03:35.686 --> 03:39.535
See? You need a thing.
Like YouTube Clip Guy.

03:46.712 --> 03:48.139
You're right.

03:48.159 --> 03:49.999
I do need a thing.

03:50.029 --> 03:51.406
But choose wisely.

03:51.436 --> 03:53.979
You don't want to be
Creepy Back Rub Guy.

03:53.989 --> 03:56.844
Hey, don't fill up. Food Guy's
got panna cotta in his office.

03:59.557 --> 04:01.789
Hey, buddy.

04:01.799 --> 04:04.503
Hey, Douglas.

04:06.171 --> 04:08.744
You're so tight.

04:09.216 --> 04:12.303
I was, uh, relaxed
about two seconds ago.

04:13.810 --> 04:16.504
You're next.

04:18.192 --> 04:20.283
Welcome to Mosbius Designs.

04:21.339 --> 04:22.263
Who the hell are you?

04:22.303 --> 04:25.339
I'm PJ, Mr. Mosby's assistant.

04:25.349 --> 04:26.856
- Ted, what the hell is going on?
- I'm sorry.

04:26.866 --> 04:30.546
We do not interrupt Mr. Mosby
during his brainstorming hour.

04:30.556 --> 04:34.023
It's okay, PJ. That's
Robin. She lives here.

04:34.033 --> 04:36.525
Oh, I'm sorry for the disturbance, sir.

04:36.545 --> 04:38.406
Do you need anything else?

04:38.416 --> 04:41.511
- Well, I wouldn't say no to a cup of coffee.
- You're right there!

04:42.536 --> 04:46.175
So now Ted has an assistant
to help him not do anything.

04:46.206 --> 04:50.979
Hey, PJ's been a huge help to me, setting
up the office, designing the Web site.

04:51.030 --> 04:53.723
And in return, I'm mentoring
a bright young mind.

04:53.753 --> 04:56.297
Ah, yes, the mentoring.

04:56.317 --> 04:59.171
I want you to go outside
today and simply...

04:59.211 --> 05:02.377
put your hands on buildings. All right?

05:02.387 --> 05:06.659
Feel the concrete pulse. Listen...

05:06.669 --> 05:10.619
Listen to the stories the
stones are telling you.

05:11.725 --> 05:14.831
- And pick up my dry cleaning.
- I will.

05:15.364 --> 05:18.339
- Thank you so much, Mr. Moy.
- All right.

05:19.866 --> 05:21.786
Hey, Ted?

05:21.796 --> 05:24.782
This table just told me you're a douche.

05:26.148 --> 05:30.289
This whole mentoring thing is just another way
to procrastinate from actually calling clients.

05:30.309 --> 05:33.154
I'm not procrastinating. I just...

05:33.164 --> 05:34.963
I want everything to be perfect, okay?

05:35.004 --> 05:36.471
I only get one shot at this.

05:36.511 --> 05:38.752
Fine, but PJ is not helping.

05:39.586 --> 05:44.793
If Ted says that PJ is important to the
company, then PJ is not going anywhere.

05:44.803 --> 05:46.844
See? He's very valuable.

05:48.663 --> 05:50.342
PJ's a guy?

05:50.362 --> 05:52.292
PJ's not some hot chick you're banging?

05:52.332 --> 05:54.864
No, I'm-I'm mentoring him.

05:55.799 --> 05:58.030
Mentoring.

05:58.040 --> 06:00.252
I mentored a young fellow once.

06:00.282 --> 06:01.921
Even made him my wingman.

06:01.951 --> 06:07.891
Then, one day, he hired an assistant
to work ten feet from his bedroom who--

06:07.932 --> 06:12.826
get this-- isn't a hot chick, proving
he never listened to a word I said.

06:12.856 --> 06:15.650
And do you know that young man's name?

06:15.660 --> 06:18.385
- Ted Mosby?
- Maybe.

06:18.395 --> 06:22.746
I don't remember.
Because he is dead to me!

06:26.808 --> 06:30.797
PJ's gonna be getting a very
confusing card in the mail,

06:30.818 --> 06:36.688
along with a garment that he should by no means
wear for three days and then mail back to me.

06:40.024 --> 06:41.522
Hey, Barney.

06:41.562 --> 06:44.598
I thought of a "thing" to
make me more essential here.

06:44.628 --> 06:48.156
I'm Eco Guy, 'cause everybody
loves a guy who recycles, right?

06:48.196 --> 06:50.226
Fired. What else you got?

06:50.236 --> 06:52.720
I thought of a few
others: Wacky Tie Guy.

06:52.740 --> 06:53.715
Fired.

06:53.725 --> 06:55.383
Daily Fun Fact Guy?

06:55.393 --> 06:57.735
Did you know that you're fired?

06:57.745 --> 06:59.674
I Know a Good Stretch for That Guy?

06:59.704 --> 07:01.695
Downward-facing fired.

07:01.715 --> 07:03.022
Monty Python Guy?

07:03.062 --> 07:06.218
We are the knights who
say... You're fired.

07:06.720 --> 07:11.274
Wait! Wait! I did used to run a fantasy
baseball league back in law school.

07:11.284 --> 07:13.897
That's not bad. You
might be on to something.

07:13.907 --> 07:17.023
Awesome. Awesome! I'll be Fantasy Guy!

07:17.033 --> 07:18.540
We'll have to make you Sports Guy.

07:18.570 --> 07:20.009
We already have a Fantasy Guy.

07:20.029 --> 07:22.491
- What's up, bros?
- Hey, Frank.

07:26.983 --> 07:28.028
Hello?

07:28.069 --> 07:31.276
Ah, hey, PJ. Where are
you? You're never late.

07:32.632 --> 07:36.331
You're on top of the
Empire State Building?

07:36.843 --> 07:40.503
Listen to the old gal. She's
got some stories to tell.

07:40.513 --> 07:43.769
Take all the time you need. Okay.

07:45.950 --> 07:48.835
Wait a second. Ted Mosby Home.

07:50.825 --> 07:53.840
Oh, my God, the call's
coming from inside the house.

07:55.000 --> 08:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:03.208 --> 08:06.626
That's not the Empire State Building.

08:10.214 --> 08:13.622
Robin, you cannot
sleep with my assistant.

08:13.652 --> 08:15.521
I'm trying to run a business here.

08:15.551 --> 08:17.189
How did this even happen?

08:17.219 --> 08:20.345
Well, at lunch, when you
go on your wisdom walks,

08:20.355 --> 08:23.421
it gives me and PJ some
time alone together.

08:23.452 --> 08:26.456
Inspiration... do your thing.

08:26.467 --> 08:30.145
It always does, sir. It always does.

08:32.407 --> 08:35.945
Hey, PJ, I actually have an
architectural question for you.

08:35.965 --> 08:38.317
Um, how does Ted's ass taste?

08:38.327 --> 08:42.328
I wouldn't know, but I
assume it tastes like genius.

08:47.594 --> 08:49.101
Why is the bathroom locked?

08:49.152 --> 08:52.057
Visitors need to sign
in for the bathroom key.

08:52.067 --> 08:57.112
Listen, Peej, and I want you to think
this over real good before you answer.

08:57.162 --> 09:01.153
Are you telling me that I can't
go to the bathroom in my apartment?

09:01.183 --> 09:02.379
No.

09:02.410 --> 09:08.511
I am telling you that you need to ask
permission to use the bathroom in my office.

09:09.154 --> 09:11.496
Why is that so hot?

09:12.491 --> 09:14.873
Robin, there are billions
of guys in the world.

09:14.903 --> 09:16.763
Why do you have to
sleep with my assistant?

09:16.803 --> 09:19.487
Ted, when I get off work,
it's 5:30 in the morning.

09:19.527 --> 09:22.250
Do you have any idea what
kind of guys I'm meeting?

09:22.260 --> 09:23.828
I deliver newspapers.

09:23.858 --> 09:27.246
It's a dirty job, but
somebody's got to do it.

09:27.980 --> 09:31.990
Don't worry. I'll wash them
before I handle your business.

09:32.613 --> 09:33.930
I live with my mom.

09:33.960 --> 09:38.795
At night, we watch TV in her
bed. We call it "Cuddle Club."

09:39.378 --> 09:43.861
So, you, uh, get up really early to
trade on the European stock exchanges?

09:43.871 --> 09:44.816
What's that like?

09:44.836 --> 09:47.178
Look, is this going to happen or not?

09:48.384 --> 09:51.198
Okay, first of all, I've
hung out with Fantasy Guy.

09:51.208 --> 09:52.766
You could do a lot worse.

09:52.776 --> 09:54.967
Secondly, this has to stop.

09:54.977 --> 09:57.600
Distracting PJ is going
to kill our productivity.

09:57.610 --> 10:00.877
What productivity? You haven't
even called a single client.

10:00.887 --> 10:04.295
Hey, once I get the Web site
up, the brochures printed,

10:04.345 --> 10:06.858
and figure out what trusts games we're
going to play at the corporate retreat,

10:06.868 --> 10:09.380
I am making those calls.

10:09.782 --> 10:11.401
Corporate retreat?

10:11.451 --> 10:14.336
Mr. Mosby and I are
going camping on the roof.

10:16.245 --> 10:17.572
Hey, Sports Guy.

10:17.602 --> 10:19.079
I hear people are
raving about your league.

10:19.110 --> 10:21.422
It's a lot harder than
I thought it would be.

10:21.452 --> 10:25.754
Between entry fees and transaction
fees and penalty fees, I'm actually...

10:25.764 --> 10:28.065
I'm holding on to a lot of money.

10:28.095 --> 10:30.850
Great work, Sports Guy.
That's for last week.

10:35.151 --> 10:38.740
60, 80, a hundred.

10:39.042 --> 10:42.690
Okay. This is $18,000 cash.

10:43.042 --> 10:44.499
It's not a big deal.

10:44.539 --> 10:47.806
I'll just, uh, take it home
and put it somewhere safe.

10:47.827 --> 10:51.937
Okay, just walking down the street
with some money in my pocket.

10:51.947 --> 10:55.526
Don't touch the money. That's
so obvious. Just be cool.

10:56.250 --> 10:59.254
Oh, no. The baby's on to me.

10:59.265 --> 11:01.888
Babies can smell money.
Everyone knows that!

11:01.898 --> 11:05.115
I'm carrying a lot of money!

11:05.607 --> 11:09.356
Seriously, dude, I'm not sure how
much longer I can keep doing this.

11:09.386 --> 11:13.275
Marshall, last week you were trash
that no one wanted to look at.

11:13.336 --> 11:14.824
Now, you're Sports Guy.

11:14.854 --> 11:17.397
- I was trash?
- Last week!

11:18.040 --> 11:21.286
Hey, there's Ted Mosby
of Mosbius Designs.

11:21.326 --> 11:23.207
How's the home office coming, buddy?

11:23.217 --> 11:27.297
Well, it was going great till
Robin started banging my assistant.

11:29.227 --> 11:31.257
Ted, it's our apartment, okay?

11:31.317 --> 11:35.318
You leave a big chocolate cake on the
counter, Mama's gonna cut her off a slice.

11:35.328 --> 11:36.846
I told you.

11:36.876 --> 11:39.670
Hire a cute assistant
that you can sleep with,

11:39.700 --> 11:42.354
but instead you hire a cute
assistant that Robin can sleep with.

11:42.384 --> 11:44.183
And of course he's gonna sleep
with her, Ted. Look at her!

11:44.193 --> 11:46.786
She's the greatest woman on the
planet! I'm getting off topic!

11:46.796 --> 11:50.998
You're an idiot! That's my
message! You're an idiot!

11:52.737 --> 11:54.335
No.

11:54.365 --> 11:58.375
One person storming off isn't
enough! Marshall, storm off with me!

12:03.250 --> 12:08.538
Barney. Dude, why are this upset about Ted
not having sex with the people he hires?

12:08.548 --> 12:10.558
Because it hurts!

12:10.598 --> 12:11.995
It hurts you how?

12:12.025 --> 12:16.458
It hurts because I love... Ted.

12:17.373 --> 12:19.312
Having sex with women.

12:19.342 --> 12:21.332
I'm a very dedicated wingman!

12:21.352 --> 12:23.614
Look, Lily's the only person that
I can talk to about this stuff.

12:23.634 --> 12:25.151
Just get her to talk to me.

12:25.181 --> 12:27.052
I'll try, but, look,
there's no guarantees.

12:27.092 --> 12:31.092
She's still really
outraged about that joke.

12:32.177 --> 12:34.187
That joke.

12:34.207 --> 12:37.977
Torn our little group apart, pitted
people I love against each other.

12:38.017 --> 12:39.555
Seriously, I wish...

12:39.575 --> 12:42.892
I wish that joke had
never come into our lives.

12:45.184 --> 12:47.857
- It's kinda of funny though, right?
- It's so funny, man.

12:49.154 --> 12:51.154
Hey, good news, PJ.

12:51.174 --> 12:52.823
The brochures you designed just came in.

12:52.853 --> 12:54.471
Really interesting choice for the cover.

12:54.512 --> 12:58.873
I like how instead of one of
my designs, you chose this.

12:58.883 --> 13:02.522
You know what? I must've
sent in the wrong photo.

13:02.532 --> 13:04.181
You think?

13:04.211 --> 13:07.367
Look, PJ, the Web site's still not done.

13:07.407 --> 13:09.738
You didn't even show up
to the corporate retreat--

13:09.779 --> 13:12.855
by the way, I saw a shooting star...

13:12.865 --> 13:17.116
and you're late every day. I-I'm
sorry, PJ. I gotta get focused.

13:17.126 --> 13:18.252
You're fired.

13:18.292 --> 13:21.630
- You can't fire...
- PJ, you're fired.

13:21.640 --> 13:23.841
Fine!

13:26.383 --> 13:29.892
Hey, baby. I just got fired.

13:30.716 --> 13:34.052
Yeah, I'll wait for you
at your place. Okay, bye.

13:35.831 --> 13:38.435
Oh, Wheel of Fortune.

13:40.867 --> 13:44.254
veve having all this free
time to spend with you.

13:44.264 --> 13:46.878
I'm going to kiss you here...

13:46.888 --> 13:48.295
And here.

13:48.346 --> 13:51.180
And here and here. And...

13:51.190 --> 13:53.190
Please stop.

13:54.587 --> 13:55.955
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

13:55.985 --> 13:59.512
- I'll miss you.
- I'll miss you, too.

14:04.306 --> 14:05.885
You're already sick of him, aren't you?

14:05.905 --> 14:07.935
He's driving me crazy.

14:07.955 --> 14:10.116
When PJ had a job, he was sexy.

14:10.156 --> 14:12.629
He was guardian of the bathroom key.

14:12.649 --> 14:17.042
A hot guy telling you
when you can and can't pee?

14:17.052 --> 14:19.021
That's the dream.

14:19.042 --> 14:22.097
That's the dream? The dream?

14:22.107 --> 14:24.721
Like what Martin Luther
King was talking about?

14:24.731 --> 14:26.319
I have to end it, don't I?

14:26.339 --> 14:28.289
I'm terrible at breakups.

14:28.319 --> 14:31.787
I still have to go a little bit, but I
couldn't be away from you one second longer.

14:31.827 --> 14:35.224
Oh, listen, uh...

14:35.234 --> 14:37.365
- Dude, I don't know.
- What?

14:37.375 --> 14:39.606
Yeah, it's just...

14:39.616 --> 14:42.089
It's not really...

14:42.109 --> 14:44.280
ix-nay, you know?

14:44.310 --> 14:47.235
Ix-nay on what?

14:47.245 --> 14:50.070
- Not feeling it.
- Not feeling what?

14:50.080 --> 14:51.728
But-but friends and stuff.

14:51.738 --> 14:54.351
Oh, my God, this is
the worst breakup ever.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.130
You're breaking up with me?

14:56.170 --> 15:00.171
Oh, if that's what you
want, I-I totally understand.

15:02.644 --> 15:05.729
You still haven't activated that
shortstop the Mariners just brought up.

15:05.739 --> 15:08.032
Got to have it.

15:08.484 --> 15:10.675
See, Sports Guy! People love you.

15:10.685 --> 15:14.052
I can't be Sports Guy
anymore, okay? It's killing me!

15:14.062 --> 15:18.937
I keep getting these constant texts and e-mails
and phone calls in the middle of the night.

15:18.947 --> 15:22.545
Sometimes I even think
that I'm being followed.

15:23.379 --> 15:24.917
Hey, buddy.

15:24.937 --> 15:28.626
I need you to push that trade
through, so I can set my new lineup.

15:28.978 --> 15:32.124
Wow, you really carry it in
your shoulders, don't you?

15:32.174 --> 15:34.415
Seriously, it's over.

15:34.435 --> 15:36.647
Do you want me to stop?

15:37.622 --> 15:39.974
No.

15:39.984 --> 15:44.678
With Robin and PJ broken up, I was free
to make some staffing changes inhe office.

15:46.125 --> 15:48.789
Hi, welcome to Mosbius Designs.

15:48.799 --> 15:51.000
You got to be kidding me?

15:51.040 --> 15:54.056
And now that PJ was back at work...

15:54.598 --> 15:57.603
You got to be kidding me?

15:57.613 --> 16:01.101
So, uh... apparently Robin
and PJ are an item again.

16:01.111 --> 16:03.795
You got to be kidding me!

16:06.690 --> 16:09.041
Are you all right?

16:09.051 --> 16:12.067
Okay, since Lily's not talking to me,
there's something that I have to tell you.

16:12.098 --> 16:15.022
And this isn't easy to say, all right?

16:15.716 --> 16:18.138
I'm... wait for it...

16:18.570 --> 16:20.963
in... wait for it...

16:21.284 --> 16:23.706
love... wait for it...

16:24.289 --> 16:26.772
with... wait for it...

16:31.386 --> 16:33.617
a... wait for it...

16:34.280 --> 16:35.275
certain... wait for it...

16:35.285 --> 16:38.050
- I know that you're in love with Robin.
- What?

16:38.060 --> 16:40.844
- Lily told me.
- She told you?

16:40.854 --> 16:42.261
Great.

16:43.246 --> 16:46.955
I bet you guys have been laughing
at me behind my back the whole time.

16:47.749 --> 16:52.443
Actually, um... in a weird way, we both
think you're kind of perfect for each other.

16:53.056 --> 16:55.287
- You do?
- Yeah.Matter of fact, um,

16:55.297 --> 16:58.715
we even try to sit onhe same side of the
booth so you two will have to sit together.

16:58.725 --> 17:00.946
Really? That's so sweet.

17:00.956 --> 17:06.153
But let's be clear. I
don't love her. Okay?

17:06.163 --> 17:09.087
I just... miss her
when she's not around.

17:09.097 --> 17:12.625
I think about her all the time, and I imagine us
one day running towards each other in slow motion,

17:12.655 --> 17:15.570
and I'm wearing a brown suede vest.

17:15.580 --> 17:17.038
Are you ever going to
tell her how you feel?

17:17.058 --> 17:21.510
No. Maybe. Never. I don't know. Look...

17:21.520 --> 17:25.098
I just need to get that
PJ idiot awafrom her.

17:25.128 --> 17:28.556
If Lily were here, she'd know
exactly how to get rid of him.

17:28.566 --> 17:29.833
Maybe I can help.

17:29.863 --> 17:32.216
Marshall, you're no Lily.

17:32.226 --> 17:34.447
Lily is a diabolical puppet master,

17:34.457 --> 17:38.165
subtly manipulating every situation
to get exactly what she wants.

17:38.195 --> 17:40.749
She's pure evil, Marshall.

17:40.759 --> 17:43.975
You got a good one
there. Hang on to her.

17:44.367 --> 17:48.045
Meanwhile, my bizarre tug of
war with Robin over PJ continued.

17:48.056 --> 17:49.966
Hey, PJ.

17:49.996 --> 17:52.368
I was about to go on my wisdom walk.

17:52.378 --> 17:53.634
Want to join me?

17:53.644 --> 17:55.443
Hey, PJ.

17:55.473 --> 17:58.197
I took the bathroom keywithout asking.

17:58.207 --> 18:00.419
What are you going to do about it?

18:00.881 --> 18:03.173
Look... you guys are both great.

18:03.183 --> 18:06.107
But the truth is I'm taking another job.

18:06.590 --> 18:08.209
These are for you.

18:08.239 --> 18:11.043
Robin, I hope this letter
offers some closure.

18:11.053 --> 18:14.269
Ted, I'm really going to miss you.

18:16.601 --> 18:18.732
You can't trade Manny Ramirez
for two middle relievers!

18:18.762 --> 18:20.662
If you veto that trade,
I am out of the league!

18:20.692 --> 18:23.586
Okay! Okay! I'll figure it out.

18:26.311 --> 18:29.025
Hire the kid to be a "paralegal."

18:29.035 --> 18:32.241
He gets to do all the work, and
you still get to be Sports Guy.

18:32.281 --> 18:35.769
Pure evil, Eriksen. Pure evil.

18:39.387 --> 18:41.216
Thanks.

18:45.358 --> 18:47.569
You okay?

18:49.217 --> 18:51.700
What if I don't think of the books?

18:51.710 --> 18:53.218
Excuse me?

18:53.248 --> 18:57.811
There's this famous architecture story
about an architect who designed this library.

18:57.821 --> 18:59.660
It was perfect.

18:59.690 --> 19:04.757
But every year, the whole thing would
sink a couple inches into the ground.

19:05.088 --> 19:08.354
Eventually, the building was condemned.

19:08.365 --> 19:13.009
He forgot to account for
the weight of the books.

19:13.019 --> 19:16.225
This company... it's just me.

19:17.451 --> 19:19.934
What if I don't think of the books?

19:19.944 --> 19:24.668
Okay... first of all, nobody goes to
libraries anymore, so who cares about that guy?

19:25.070 --> 19:29.543
Secondly, you need to get on the
phone and start calling clients.

19:29.583 --> 19:31.362
The longer I put off
starting my own firm,

19:31.372 --> 19:36.357
the longer it can remain a dream
and not something I screwed up at.

19:36.950 --> 19:40.087
I mean, it's like I'm giving
up before I even started.

19:40.117 --> 19:42.026
You want to talk about giving up?

19:42.056 --> 19:47.896
I used to describe my ideal guy as
"funny, smart, passionate, challenging."

19:47.927 --> 19:52.138
And now, apparently, I will
settle for "in my apartment."

19:53.253 --> 19:55.877
Didn't you think you'd have
it all more figured out by now?

19:55.917 --> 19:59.375
Are you kidding?By 30, I was
going to be annoyingly successful,

19:59.385 --> 20:02.430
married to the perfect
woman, maybe a kid on the way.

20:02.470 --> 20:08.712
Instead, I'm just some guy sitting in his
apartment, having a staring contest with his phone.

20:09.456 --> 20:12.461
And losing.

20:13.717 --> 20:16.421
You can take that thing.

20:32.232 --> 20:34.926
Hi, this is Ted Mosby
of Mosbius Designs.

20:34.976 --> 20:38.423
I'm calling to inquire about any design
needs you may have now or in the future.

20:38.443 --> 20:39.287
That sounds great, buddy.

20:39.297 --> 20:40.775
- Really? I sound confident?
- Yup.

20:40.785 --> 20:43.268
- Now call an actual client.
- Great.

20:46.263 --> 20:48.173
Hey, Food Guy!

20:49.147 --> 20:51.359
Hey, Toy Guy!

20:56.244 --> 20:58.666
Who's that guy?

20:58.988 --> 21:00.978
He doesn't work here.

21:00.998 --> 21:03.300
- I think we should leave the building.
- Really?

21:03.310 --> 21:05.611
This has happened before.
