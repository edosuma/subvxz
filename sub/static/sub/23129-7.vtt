WEBVTT

00:02.170 --> 00:03.228
- Previously...

00:03.270 --> 00:05.193
- You dragged me
through my death spot.

00:05.230 --> 00:07.164
That means I get out
through yours.

00:07.200 --> 00:10.101
- No!
- May God strike you dead!

00:10.140 --> 00:12.234
- Donna's death spot
was in a ShopMart?

00:12.280 --> 00:14.078
- (Sally):
That's my brother, Robbie.

00:14.110 --> 00:15.703
- I'm selling the place.

00:15.740 --> 00:18.607
I'm gonna be trying to fix up
the house, best I can.

00:22.520 --> 00:26.514
- Joshy's wolf thought it would
be OK to sleep with my wife!

00:26.560 --> 00:28.710
(Screaming)

00:28.760 --> 00:30.626
- The wolf is winning!

00:32.800 --> 00:35.189
- I cannot change every vampire,

00:35.230 --> 00:37.119
but I'd feel
a hell of a lot better

00:37.170 --> 00:39.389
if I knew some of them
didn't have to kill humans.

00:39.440 --> 00:41.534
- Then why don't you
let me be your test case?

00:41.570 --> 00:43.766
- If you slip,
I will be ruthless.

00:43.810 --> 00:45.505
- I need your help.

01:01.460 --> 01:03.656
- Hey! How
you doing?

01:03.690 --> 01:05.522
- I know, I shouldn't
have called.

01:05.560 --> 01:08.120
I got no business taking
handouts from you, Kenny.

01:08.160 --> 01:09.230
- One tiny slipup

01:09.270 --> 01:11.261
doesn't invalidate
an entire way of life.

01:11.300 --> 01:13.530
- Really? You got
nothing to say about this?

01:13.570 --> 01:18.440
- It's no judgement.
Remember? I meant that.

01:18.470 --> 01:21.303
Besides, I mean,
it's one dead girl.

01:21.340 --> 01:23.707
You'll be back
in the horse tomorrow.

01:23.750 --> 01:24.774
Oh, hey! Come on.

01:24.810 --> 01:26.710
Why don't you
come back to the office?

01:26.750 --> 01:28.514
All this blood
in you, live blood,

01:28.550 --> 01:30.382
it's gonna be
a shock to the system.

01:30.420 --> 01:32.388
I can tell already.

01:32.420 --> 01:34.582
My fridge stash is intact.
It'll ease you down.

01:34.620 --> 01:36.452
- I can't handle
myself. Look, just...

01:36.490 --> 01:38.652
Just make sure you
take care of her.

01:38.690 --> 01:40.294
- Come on, Aidan.

01:44.700 --> 01:46.862
- (Nora): Guys, what's
going on down here?

01:49.240 --> 01:50.639
(Whispering):
Oh my God!

01:52.180 --> 01:53.170
Robbie!

01:53.210 --> 01:55.804
Oh no!

01:55.840 --> 01:58.605
- Any particular reason
these two can see me?

01:58.650 --> 02:00.311
- We're werewolves.

02:00.350 --> 02:03.741
- Yeah, I'll explain
that one later.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.815
How the hell
did this happen?

02:05.850 --> 02:08.558
- I don't know. I don't know.
I was stuck in the past.

02:11.660 --> 02:15.494
- Hey, man, I'm--I'm--
I'm really sorry.

02:15.530 --> 02:19.637
It's just that we need to figure
out what to do with his, uh...

02:19.670 --> 02:21.229
- You wanna get rid
of my body?

02:22.410 --> 02:25.710
Are we sure that I'm even dead?

02:25.740 --> 02:28.334
What if this is a tunnel
of light situation,

02:28.380 --> 02:31.179
and I just haven't turned
around to get back yet.

02:31.210 --> 02:33.611
I mean, I'm right here!

02:33.650 --> 02:35.379
Is it-- Is this
really happening?

02:35.420 --> 02:37.184
Isn't...
Can't we...

02:37.220 --> 02:39.211
What happened to you?

02:39.260 --> 02:41.513
- I died.

02:41.560 --> 02:43.187
Danny killed me.

02:43.230 --> 02:46.791
- But I--I--I saw you
before I went to Florida.

02:46.830 --> 02:48.457
We--we touched!

02:48.500 --> 02:50.923
- It turns out that
there is an afterlife.

02:50.970 --> 02:53.359
And there are pros
and there are cons.

02:53.400 --> 02:54.629
And when you saw me...

02:56.440 --> 02:57.669
I was back.

02:57.710 --> 03:00.270
- What, we...
We can do that?

03:00.310 --> 03:01.937
- Oh no!

03:01.980 --> 03:04.950
- Wait, we can do that and
you won't do it for me?

03:04.980 --> 03:06.948
- You... You don't
want her to. Trust me.

03:06.980 --> 03:08.812
- Well, I don't
wanna be dead either!

03:08.850 --> 03:10.909
- The situation with
Donna was different--

03:10.950 --> 03:13.282
- Sally! Whoa! Are we
even discussing this?

03:13.320 --> 03:16.255
- I'm just saying that there's
gotta be a different way,

03:16.290 --> 03:17.257
like, a better way!

03:17.290 --> 03:18.519
- To do what, exactly?

03:19.600 --> 03:20.954
- To bring my brother back...

03:22.530 --> 03:24.191
from the dead.

03:29.970 --> 03:32.576
- So, what? You can
actually do this?

03:32.610 --> 03:36.444
- Yeah, I think so. I--
I have this, like, witch thing.

03:36.480 --> 03:39.279
- Oh. So there are
ghosts and witches.

03:39.320 --> 03:42.312
- Can we just pump the brakes on
the whole resurrection situation

03:42.350 --> 03:43.943
until Aidan gets
home, Sally, please?

03:43.990 --> 03:45.583
- I vote no, actually.

03:45.620 --> 03:47.850
- Robbie, I'm sorry,
man. There's just--

03:47.890 --> 03:50.450
There's certain elements
of raising a corpse

03:50.490 --> 03:53.824
that only the inhabitants of
this household can attest to.

03:53.860 --> 03:55.589
- Oh, come on!
That was one time!

03:55.630 --> 03:56.722
- Significant time!

03:56.770 --> 03:58.465
- One very specific case.

03:58.500 --> 03:59.570
- This is my brother!

03:59.600 --> 04:00.567
I'd never do to him

04:00.600 --> 04:01.863
what was done to me.

04:01.900 --> 04:03.607
I'm running
through spells

04:03.640 --> 04:05.563
and I'm about
to land on something.

04:05.610 --> 04:07.271
- Yeah, I'm gonna call Aidan.

04:07.310 --> 04:08.869
Maybe the vampires
can clean up.

04:08.910 --> 04:09.877
- The vampires?

04:09.910 --> 04:11.708
- Nobody's touching that body!

04:14.380 --> 04:16.314
Look, I know this
is a lot. And just...

04:16.350 --> 04:17.749
- This didn't
work out for you.

04:17.790 --> 04:18.939
- No.

04:18.990 --> 04:21.015
- So, why do you think
it'll work for me?

04:21.060 --> 04:23.825
- Because it has to!

04:23.860 --> 04:25.749
- Did you just,
uh, call me?

04:25.790 --> 04:27.258
- Yeah! Yeah...

04:28.400 --> 04:29.595
- Hey! Hello, hi.

04:31.870 --> 04:34.635
- Oh no! How?

04:34.670 --> 04:36.866
- Well, he was working
down in the basement.

04:36.910 --> 04:39.834
Looks like it was just
a good, old-fashioned accident.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.029
- Sally, I'm sorry.

04:41.080 --> 04:42.900
- Yeah, it sucks for me too.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.008
- Where were you?

04:44.050 --> 04:45.609
- Out.

04:45.650 --> 04:47.709
Just needed to grab
something to drink.

04:47.750 --> 04:49.388
- Drink?

04:49.420 --> 04:52.310
What, like...
like, blood?

04:52.360 --> 04:53.657
(Laughing)

04:53.690 --> 04:55.613
- Yeah, something like that.

04:55.660 --> 04:59.551
I think I might have an extra
bag in the fridge downstairs.

05:00.700 --> 05:02.020
- He meant blood,
didn't he?

05:15.410 --> 05:19.074
- I'm sorry, are you
mourning privately?

05:19.110 --> 05:20.373
- Oh, Sally!

05:20.420 --> 05:22.479
I-- I'm so sorry. I--

05:22.520 --> 05:24.841
(Breathing heavily)

05:29.930 --> 05:31.955
- OK, OK.

05:31.990 --> 05:33.958
(Sighing)

05:34.000 --> 05:36.822
Look, um, I know how
you feel about magic

05:36.870 --> 05:38.827
and using it
as a quick fix.

05:38.870 --> 05:41.032
- Yeah, I guess
I already know

05:41.070 --> 05:44.040
that you're gonna do
whatever it takes to save him.

05:44.070 --> 05:47.506
- Yeah. Yeah, I am.

05:47.540 --> 05:51.977
- Look, your, um, power,
it's part of who you are now.

05:52.010 --> 05:53.910
It's like me and Josh,

05:53.950 --> 05:57.818
we've all used parts
of our nature for good,

05:57.850 --> 05:59.818
but not always.

06:01.120 --> 06:02.724
- Well, most
of the time.

06:02.760 --> 06:04.683
- Yeah, but he's your brother.

06:04.730 --> 06:06.391
(Sighing)

06:06.430 --> 06:09.889
The way that you love him,
you just want him to be OK...

06:11.130 --> 06:12.598
that is...

06:14.040 --> 06:16.099
undeniably good.

06:16.140 --> 06:18.962
- OK... I'm really glad
you feel that way,

06:19.010 --> 06:22.708
because there's no spell
to save Robbie in the book.

06:22.750 --> 06:23.876
- Then--then...

06:23.910 --> 06:24.980
- I need her...

06:26.180 --> 06:27.875
in the flesh.

06:27.920 --> 06:29.979
I need to summon Donna.

06:42.530 --> 06:44.897
- You don't think it's a
good idea, bringing me back?

06:44.930 --> 06:46.739
- I don't think
what I think matters.

06:46.770 --> 06:49.808
I think it's between
you and your sister, honestly.

06:51.070 --> 06:53.607
- I've got it. Thanks.

06:57.480 --> 06:58.902
- Hey. I have to go.

06:58.950 --> 07:00.714
- What? Where?

07:00.750 --> 07:01.911
- I have to go find Donna,

07:01.950 --> 07:03.782
the witch who
gave me this power.

07:03.820 --> 07:06.187
I need to find her
to get you back.

07:06.220 --> 07:07.756
- OK, T'll
come with you.

07:07.790 --> 07:09.929
- No. It's really intense
what I have to do.

07:09.960 --> 07:11.928
It's more intense
than the fact that

07:11.960 --> 07:14.657
your sister lives with wolves
and a guy who eats guys.

07:14.700 --> 07:16.498
- OK.

07:16.530 --> 07:18.897
- Do you guys mind staying
with him while I'm gone?

07:18.930 --> 07:22.867
He likes home-improvement shows
and movies about getting stoned.

07:22.910 --> 07:25.004
- Actually, I have
an appointment.

07:25.040 --> 07:26.929
- OK. Thanks
for coming through.

07:26.980 --> 07:29.039
- No, we'll be with him.
- Really?

07:30.210 --> 07:32.042
- Yeah, of course we will.

07:32.080 --> 07:33.070
- Thanks.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.212
- Go.

07:34.250 --> 07:35.615
- OK, if his
door comes,

07:35.650 --> 07:36.685
don't let
him take it.

07:36.720 --> 07:37.687
- Oh, come on!

07:37.720 --> 07:38.687
- Door?

07:38.720 --> 07:39.687
- Yeah.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.051
Just don't
worry about it.

07:41.090 --> 07:42.080
- Wait! Sally!

07:42.120 --> 07:44.953
Don't--don't
walk out on me again.

07:45.990 --> 07:48.095
- I'm not--
I'm not leaving.

07:48.130 --> 07:49.962
OK, I promise
I'm coming back.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.525
I promise.

07:54.740 --> 07:56.196
- Could--could
I do that?

08:27.840 --> 08:31.868
- Sorry about that. Sudden,
urgent need for extremities.

08:31.910 --> 08:33.230
Thank you. Carry on.

08:36.880 --> 08:40.270
- Devil! Yet another
devil, come to curse us!

08:40.320 --> 08:41.275
- All right, yep!

08:41.320 --> 08:42.741
Heard you the first time,

08:42.789 --> 08:45.145
and I gotta say,
it's getting old, lady!

08:45.190 --> 08:46.749
Getting old.

08:46.790 --> 08:49.589
- (Man): Kill the devil woman!
- (Woman): Witch!

08:54.930 --> 08:56.295
- No!
- Do not look on the devil!

08:56.330 --> 08:57.889
- I got you.

08:57.930 --> 09:00.035
- No, stop!
Stop, please let me be!

09:00.070 --> 09:01.629
- No, Donna--
- Please!

09:01.670 --> 09:03.308
- This is too important!

09:03.340 --> 09:06.571
- No!

09:06.610 --> 09:07.873
(Gasping)

09:17.620 --> 09:19.213
- Hey.
- Hey!

09:23.330 --> 09:25.059
- I missed you.

09:25.090 --> 09:26.319
- Hmm.

09:27.360 --> 09:28.998
- Did you miss me?

09:29.030 --> 09:31.067
- Well, it's only
been one night.

09:31.100 --> 09:33.933
That's hardly unmanageable
after 200 years.

09:33.970 --> 09:34.937
(Laughing)

09:34.970 --> 09:36.290
- Hey, listen, um...

09:36.340 --> 09:38.661
I'm gonna need
a little something.

09:38.710 --> 09:40.075
It's been so long
since I've fed

09:40.110 --> 09:42.306
and I don't have control,
not like you, not yet.

09:42.340 --> 09:43.307
- It takes time.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.671
- Yes, well,
I don't have time,

09:45.710 --> 09:49.078
so if I could get
something, like, now, please.

09:49.120 --> 09:53.682
- It took me years,
years, to wean myself.

09:54.720 --> 09:56.825
Of course,
I was feeding live.

09:56.860 --> 09:57.827
(Sighing)

09:57.860 --> 09:58.850
- Thank you.

10:09.370 --> 10:10.701
(Sighing)

10:12.810 --> 10:15.131
(Vomiting)

10:18.880 --> 10:20.075
(Coughing)

10:28.190 --> 10:31.319
"Cause, you know,
that's an illegal sublet.

10:31.360 --> 10:35.126
- Excuse me, I just,
um... I just...

10:35.160 --> 10:38.824
I have to, uh, go
into the kitchen now.

10:41.940 --> 10:43.305
- Hey.

10:44.710 --> 10:46.235
He-he's terrified.

10:47.240 --> 10:48.207
You know, I get it.

10:48.240 --> 10:49.401
When we first met Sally,

10:49.440 --> 10:51.340
she wasn't exactly
Sally yet, you know?

10:51.380 --> 10:54.145
Stuck in the house,
didn't remember how she died,

10:54.180 --> 10:56.342
and that was a year
after it had happened.

10:56.380 --> 10:58.382
- It's not his fault.
I'm just-- I'm...

10:59.920 --> 11:02.924
I'm feeling a little
out of my league

11:02.960 --> 11:08.455
with the whole
ghost counselling.

11:08.500 --> 11:11.470
I mean, how am I supposed
to look him in the eyes

11:11.500 --> 11:15.095
and tell him everything in this
world of ours is just grand?

11:15.140 --> 11:16.960
Especially today.

11:19.370 --> 11:20.974
(Exhaling)

11:21.010 --> 11:25.277
- I was up all night
thinking about what you said.

11:26.880 --> 11:28.939
And you're
absolutely right.

11:28.980 --> 11:32.245
I'm not the same
person. I'm not.

11:32.290 --> 11:34.782
I haven't been
the same since you...

11:35.890 --> 11:37.051
brought me back.

11:39.260 --> 11:41.354
But Sally's back in
with Donna now.

11:41.400 --> 11:42.959
Maybe she can fix it.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.719
Maybe--maybe whatever
went wrong with the spell...

11:45.770 --> 11:48.740
Maybe she can make it right!
- Sally's distracted.

11:48.770 --> 11:51.102
- But it was the magic--
- Maybe.

11:51.140 --> 11:53.336
- What do you mean, maybe?
That's what it was!

11:53.380 --> 11:55.838
- But the magic didn't
make you like it.

11:55.880 --> 11:58.178
And it didn't
make you lie to me.

11:59.410 --> 12:00.809
(Sighing)

12:05.390 --> 12:08.951
- Sorry. Guess I kind of walked
in on something here, didn't I?

12:08.990 --> 12:13.393
But hey! Totally just
shizzamed myself in here!

12:13.430 --> 12:15.228
That's pretty advanced, right?

12:16.900 --> 12:19.119
- Kind of,
- Yeah, kind of.

12:19.170 --> 12:21.992
- Can [ at least get,
like, a cursory thank you

12:22.040 --> 12:23.769
for springing you or...

12:23.810 --> 12:27.531
- Whoa! Talk
about arrogance!

12:27.580 --> 12:30.003
You didn't spring me
from anything, sweetie.

12:30.050 --> 12:32.872
As long as my death spot
is intact, it's a 2-way door.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.115
- Oh, well, OK.

12:34.150 --> 12:36.369
Well then, how come last
time you wanted topside,

12:36.420 --> 12:37.979
you forced me
to summon you?

12:38.020 --> 12:39.385
- I know, I know.

12:39.420 --> 12:43.379
It's just that breaking
through, reliving it,

12:43.430 --> 12:45.819
it's a little bit painful.

12:49.360 --> 12:52.421
- So, I guess there's a lot
that you haven't told me.

12:52.470 --> 12:55.770
- Well, I've got a story
too, just like you.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.563
- Which I'm guessing
you're not gonna tell me.

12:59.610 --> 13:01.408
- Mmm...
- Mm-hmm, of course not.

13:01.440 --> 13:02.908
Why would you tell me?

13:02.950 --> 13:03.940
So...

13:03.980 --> 13:04.947
(Sighing)

13:04.980 --> 13:06.948
My brother's dead.

13:06.980 --> 13:09.176
This really can't be
the way it ends for him,

13:09.220 --> 13:11.439
so I need you to teach me
how to bring him back.

13:11.490 --> 13:13.413
- Listen, even my
magic has its limits.

13:13.460 --> 13:16.282
Bringing somebody back,
it goes against nature.

13:16.320 --> 13:19.449
- Maybe the way you did it for
me, but there's gotta be a way.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.320
Are you kidding me?

13:22.360 --> 13:26.422
- You didn't tell me
you were time traveling.

13:26.470 --> 13:31.203
- Are-- You have never
told me anything, ever!

13:31.240 --> 13:33.379
Besides, last time
we saw each other,

13:33.410 --> 13:35.037
you seemed
moderately vengeful.

13:35.080 --> 13:36.479
- Yeah, so
as per usual,

13:36.510 --> 13:38.945
you have no understanding
of what it means,

13:38.980 --> 13:41.074
of the consequences
of your actions.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.986
- Well, it's
not all that bad,

13:43.020 --> 13:45.443
unless, you know,
you see something

13:45.490 --> 13:47.219
that you really
don't wanna see.

13:47.260 --> 13:48.614
- Witch! No mercy!

13:48.660 --> 13:51.630
- (Girl):
You tried to steal my soul!

13:51.660 --> 13:54.095
- Donna Gilchrist!

13:54.130 --> 13:56.394
Do you wish to confess
yourself to be a witch?

13:56.430 --> 13:59.468
- Kill the devil
woman! Kill her!

13:59.500 --> 14:01.491
- Oh my God!
- This is what happened.

14:01.540 --> 14:03.008
- (Donna):
Hallowed be thy...

14:03.040 --> 14:04.235
It's what was meant to be.

14:07.040 --> 14:09.941
(Choking)

14:11.310 --> 14:12.380
(Exhaling)

14:18.690 --> 14:21.614
- I apologize
for the theatrics.

14:21.660 --> 14:23.651
I had to flush you out.

14:23.690 --> 14:27.228
You came in here
practically glowing.

14:27.260 --> 14:31.390
Live blood, I can
smell it on you.

14:31.430 --> 14:33.432
Who was it?

14:33.470 --> 14:35.393
Did you kill her?

14:36.440 --> 14:37.407
(Scoffing)

14:37.440 --> 14:39.135
Of course you did.

14:39.170 --> 14:42.231
Now, you're coming down
from the greatest high

14:42.280 --> 14:44.248
a vampire can experience.

14:44.280 --> 14:47.409
Draining a human to nothing.

14:47.450 --> 14:49.544
You're insatiable.

14:49.580 --> 14:52.186
- I don't know...

14:52.220 --> 14:53.688
(Sobbing)

14:53.720 --> 14:56.382
I wanted to keep my
promise to you, Suzanna.

14:58.190 --> 15:02.696
- But you didn't, and now
I'm forced to make you keep it.

15:02.730 --> 15:04.459
You have to dry out.

15:06.070 --> 15:08.539
And this time, I'm not
taking my eyes off you,

15:08.570 --> 15:10.538
so get used to
these 4 dingy walls.

15:10.570 --> 15:12.971
There's no way out.

15:22.480 --> 15:24.016
- So, what is the longest

15:24.050 --> 15:26.439
that you've ever been
stranded outside your own time?

15:26.490 --> 15:30.620
- What is this? When is this?
I've never been back this far.

15:30.660 --> 15:35.689
- Andover, Massachusetts,
August 18, 1692.

15:35.730 --> 15:37.220
When does this happen?

15:37.270 --> 15:38.669
Is it when
you do magic?

15:40.270 --> 15:42.329
Oh. You can only
rely on that tether

15:42.370 --> 15:45.465
to bring you back home
so many times before it snaps!

15:45.510 --> 15:47.308
- It snaps?

15:47.340 --> 15:49.604
- Yeah. You could
be lost in time for good.

15:51.210 --> 15:54.316
Sally, every time
you use our magic,

15:54.350 --> 15:59.220
you run the risk of being
trapped in the past forever.

16:05.290 --> 16:08.225
- Whoa! That's you!

16:08.260 --> 16:09.659
- That was me, yes.

16:09.700 --> 16:14.262
Well, you wanted
to know how I died twice.

16:14.300 --> 16:15.597
(Speaking Latin)

16:16.800 --> 16:18.165
Enjoy the show.

16:21.810 --> 16:24.245
- Oh! Oh!

16:24.280 --> 16:27.716
- This is all for nothing
if you don't feel it.

16:30.650 --> 16:33.017
- I'm starving.
- Good.

16:33.060 --> 16:36.360
Pain and withdrawal is a
reminder of what you've done.

16:36.390 --> 16:38.028
(Grunting)

16:38.060 --> 16:39.323
You can make it.

16:40.830 --> 16:42.650
My strength is your strength.

16:42.700 --> 16:44.464
Aidan, look at me.

16:45.730 --> 16:47.630
Tell me her name.

16:47.670 --> 16:49.263
The girl from last night,

16:49.300 --> 16:50.665
what was her
name, Aidan?

16:50.710 --> 16:51.802
- I don't remember.

16:51.840 --> 16:53.808
- Of course you
don't remember.

16:53.840 --> 16:55.433
To remember her
name would be

16:55.480 --> 16:56.709
to acknowledge her life,

16:56.740 --> 16:57.810
to honour her death.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.410
- There is no honour here!

17:00.450 --> 17:02.270
- Why don't you think about it?

17:02.320 --> 17:06.382
You picture her face
and you tell me her name.

17:12.230 --> 17:13.823
- All right.

17:13.859 --> 17:15.123
(Grunting)

17:17.329 --> 17:21.436
Oh! T'll tell you all about her.
What do you wanna know?

17:21.470 --> 17:23.438
She had very pretty eyes.

17:23.470 --> 17:25.461
Is that what
you'd like to hear?

17:25.510 --> 17:29.572
The kind that shimmer when the
life just drains away from them.

17:29.610 --> 17:30.839
Don't you love that?

17:30.880 --> 17:32.439
(Laughing)

17:32.480 --> 17:36.178
- If you wanna turn
this into a game,

17:36.220 --> 17:38.188
that's fine with me.

17:38.220 --> 17:42.589
I'm strong, I'm in this, and I
have nowhere else I need to be.

17:44.890 --> 17:46.324
- Amy.

17:46.360 --> 17:51.196
- Amy. Good. Talk about her.

17:51.230 --> 17:53.870
- Well, what would you
like me to talk about?

17:53.900 --> 17:56.597
That her blood was thick,
and it tasted like cloves?

17:56.640 --> 17:59.507
And oh my God!
Don't you miss that?

17:59.540 --> 18:04.501
The way that the blood, the
life, just runs into your mouth.

18:04.550 --> 18:05.745
(Exhaling)

18:05.780 --> 18:07.748
- Amy's dead.

18:07.780 --> 18:09.646
And that's on you.

18:10.890 --> 18:12.483
Remembering what you did

18:12.520 --> 18:15.512
or remembering the person
that you did it to,

18:15.560 --> 18:18.484
that's what
keeps you strong.

18:18.530 --> 18:21.454
That's what stops you
from killing ever again.

18:21.500 --> 18:22.854
Do you understand me?

18:22.900 --> 18:26.530
- No, I don't understand.
This is what we are.

18:26.570 --> 18:29.733
What you're doing here,
punishing me, I've done it.

18:29.770 --> 18:31.738
And you know
what I've learned?

18:31.770 --> 18:32.737
It doesn't work,

18:32.770 --> 18:34.636
it never makes me feel better,

18:34.680 --> 18:38.548
and the only thing that
makes me feel good is blood!

18:38.580 --> 18:42.278
So, if you want names,
I'm gonna give you names.

18:45.390 --> 18:49.349
- These chicks are, like,
seriously old school.

18:49.390 --> 18:52.382
(Speaking Latin)

19:00.970 --> 19:02.335
(Gasping)

19:03.340 --> 19:04.660
- They're bringing you back.

19:04.710 --> 19:07.509
OK, so that's why
you witched up.

19:07.540 --> 19:09.269
This sisterhood
is, like, no joke.

19:09.310 --> 19:11.369
- No, no. Oh,
I wasn't a witch.

19:11.410 --> 19:12.377
Not--not yet.

19:12.410 --> 19:14.549
No, not when they
found me guilty,

19:14.580 --> 19:17.413
not when they strung me
up from that tree.

19:17.450 --> 19:19.248
- You were falsely accused?

19:19.290 --> 19:20.815
- Yep.

19:20.860 --> 19:23.682
- Yet, somehow,
these charming broads

19:23.730 --> 19:27.519
managed to conjure up
a 6th member of their coven,

19:27.560 --> 19:31.428
one who, incidentally,
would be forever in their debt.

19:31.470 --> 19:34.599
- So, there is a way to bring
somebody back from the dead.

19:34.640 --> 19:36.438
- Oh God! You
do not understand!

19:36.470 --> 19:39.462
- No, no, what I understand
is that there is definitely

19:39.510 --> 19:41.706
a zombie-free way
to bring somebody back.

19:41.740 --> 19:43.708
Donna, I'm talking
about my brother!

19:43.750 --> 19:45.343
- Have you secured
the spirit?

19:45.380 --> 19:47.212
- Yes.

19:47.250 --> 19:48.740
- Call our 4th.

19:49.780 --> 19:51.919
(Speaking Latin)

19:58.760 --> 20:00.797
(Speaking Latin)

20:09.740 --> 20:12.209
(All speaking Latin)

20:14.040 --> 20:16.236
- What are they
doing to her?

20:16.280 --> 20:17.975
- There was always
a sacrifice.

20:18.010 --> 20:19.899
(Latin continues)

20:27.360 --> 20:28.555
(Speaking Latin)

20:38.670 --> 20:40.024
(Gasping)

20:40.070 --> 20:41.868
(Shrieking)

20:52.610 --> 20:55.375
Laurie Douglas...

20:55.420 --> 20:57.741
Sam Pierson, he
was an old friend.

20:57.790 --> 21:01.488
Michael Weser, Mason Collins...

21:01.520 --> 21:04.922
Kate Potter,
David Crow, Jenny Cole...

21:04.960 --> 21:07.054
And I don't remember
her sister's name,

21:07.090 --> 21:09.593
but who could forget
the Cole sisters?

21:09.630 --> 21:12.600
- Barking out random names
isn't gonna get us anywhere.

21:12.630 --> 21:15.497
You're gonna have to try
to be a little more specific.

21:15.540 --> 21:17.338
- No, you misunderstand me.

21:17.370 --> 21:19.759
This was all one night.

21:19.810 --> 21:21.938
You think that you've
done what I've done?

21:21.980 --> 21:25.541
Have you ever
devasculated them? Huh?

21:25.580 --> 21:27.412
Have you ever unmasked them?

21:28.850 --> 21:30.739
How do you live
with yourself?

21:30.790 --> 21:33.384
How do you look yourself
in the mirror?

21:34.660 --> 21:36.082
This isn't about
what we are!

21:36.120 --> 21:38.430
And don't blame this
on the condition!

21:38.460 --> 21:40.394
I did this!

21:40.430 --> 21:42.455
And I was good at it!

21:43.630 --> 21:46.327
(Aidan coughing, vomiting)

21:49.440 --> 21:51.829
- I can't believe you
didn't tell me that--

21:51.870 --> 21:53.577
Well, they used you.

21:54.580 --> 21:55.934
- It's been a lot of years

21:55.980 --> 21:58.472
since I was able to
call myself innocent.

21:58.510 --> 22:00.410
- I just don't
understand

22:00.450 --> 22:02.873
how you can go
from that person

22:02.920 --> 22:06.083
to basically eating
me and my friends.

22:06.120 --> 22:09.715
- How long did it take you to
start to depend on your magic?

22:09.760 --> 22:10.727
To abuse it?

22:10.760 --> 22:12.023
By the time you and I met,

22:12.060 --> 22:13.949
there was nothing
left of the woman

22:14.000 --> 22:16.594
hanging at the
end of that rope.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.365
- I have to ask.

22:20.400 --> 22:22.459
How does the spell work...

22:23.670 --> 22:24.865
to bring back Robbie?

22:26.840 --> 22:31.710
- The only way to resurrect a
naturally deceased mortal being

22:31.750 --> 22:35.015
is to create a pathway
of energy, a bridge,

22:35.050 --> 22:38.884
between the living world
and the plane of death.

22:41.720 --> 22:43.722
They used that girl.

22:45.190 --> 22:48.751
She lost out on any
chance for an afterlife

22:48.800 --> 22:51.895
just so that I could
continue to exist.

22:53.900 --> 22:55.493
- I can't.

22:56.970 --> 23:00.008
I've just already
hurt too many people,

23:00.040 --> 23:03.908
and I couldn't sacrifice
just some random soul,

23:03.950 --> 23:05.645
even for Robbie.

23:05.680 --> 23:10.686
- That is the first
sensible thing you have said

23:10.720 --> 23:12.814
since I ate you.

23:15.660 --> 23:17.879
But I have lived a long time.

23:19.830 --> 23:24.392
I have no right
to whatever comes next.

23:26.970 --> 23:29.632
I want you to take my soul.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.878
- I--I just don't...

23:35.910 --> 23:38.607
I just don't see how
it's physically possible

23:38.650 --> 23:40.812
that you could have
been electrocuted.

23:40.850 --> 23:43.740
- I mean, does it even really
matter how it happened?

23:43.790 --> 23:45.485
It happened.

23:45.520 --> 23:47.784
- Thinking about
how you died

23:47.820 --> 23:50.721
is not about solving
a crime, Robbie.

23:50.760 --> 23:52.728
It's for you,

23:52.760 --> 23:54.558
helping you
get closure.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.489
- And what happens
once I get closure?

23:56.530 --> 23:58.862
- Well, sometimes
there's a door.

23:58.900 --> 24:01.494
- Yeah, yeah!
What's that about?

24:01.540 --> 24:04.601
Doors to what, to where?

24:04.640 --> 24:06.563
- We have absolutely no idea.

24:06.610 --> 24:08.977
- Nora!
- No, Josh, he should know.

24:09.010 --> 24:12.002
You spend day after day,
sometimes year after year

24:12.050 --> 24:13.245
in a state of confusion,

24:13.280 --> 24:16.011
where you can't talk to anyone,

24:16.050 --> 24:17.848
you can't touch anyone.

24:17.890 --> 24:19.688
And then all of a sudden,

24:19.720 --> 24:21.210
this door shows up
to transport you

24:21.260 --> 24:22.853
to who the hell
knows where,

24:22.890 --> 24:25.154
and you're just supposed
to trust it enough

24:25.190 --> 24:26.487
to stroll on through?

24:28.560 --> 24:32.519
- So, I--I--I shouldn't
go through the door.

24:32.570 --> 24:34.698
- Sally doesn't
want you to, no.

24:34.740 --> 24:37.038
But she's still
trying to fix this.

24:37.070 --> 24:38.606
Normally,
generally speaking,

24:38.640 --> 24:40.904
doors are very good,
positive things.

24:40.940 --> 24:42.772
It's nothing to
freak out about.

24:42.810 --> 24:44.039
You're freaking him out.

24:44.080 --> 24:45.605
- He should
know the truth,

24:45.650 --> 24:46.799
that any semblance

24:46.850 --> 24:48.944
of a happy, normal
human life as he knew it

24:48.980 --> 24:52.041
ended the minute that he found
himself trapped in this house

24:52.090 --> 24:53.558
with all of us.

24:53.590 --> 24:54.853
(Nora sighing)

24:59.630 --> 25:01.792
- I'm gonna...
- Yeah, dude.

25:09.900 --> 25:10.970
(Sighing)

25:11.010 --> 25:12.102
- Nora, I'm--I--

25:12.140 --> 25:13.164
- I can't, I can't...

25:13.210 --> 25:14.700
I can't do this right now.

25:14.740 --> 25:16.037
(Sighing)

25:18.910 --> 25:20.105
Can you guys just...

25:20.150 --> 25:23.017
Can you just, like, put
on a movie or something?

25:23.050 --> 25:24.643
- Yep.

25:26.650 --> 25:28.015
- OK.

25:36.700 --> 25:39.226
- Oh! Not looking so good.

25:39.270 --> 25:42.092
Anyway, Bishop said: "No more
drinking on the job, Aidan."

25:42.140 --> 25:43.335
Bummer.

25:43.370 --> 25:46.635
And, uh, so I'm doing
this hit in the hospital,

25:46.670 --> 25:48.934
and, uh, Matt and
Charlie Herstis, gone,

25:48.980 --> 25:50.232
and I start drinking.

25:50.280 --> 25:52.305
Oops. And I drink a
little bit too much

25:52.350 --> 25:55.012
to where I feel like
I'm underneath this blanket

25:55.050 --> 25:56.142
of listless euphoria.

25:56.180 --> 25:57.341
You know what I mean?

25:57.380 --> 25:59.018
I can hear the cops coming.

25:59.050 --> 26:00.347
But, for the life of me,

26:00.390 --> 26:02.757
I can't get out from
underneath the blanket.

26:02.790 --> 26:04.189
My legs won't move.

26:04.230 --> 26:05.857
I grab the defibrillator

26:05.890 --> 26:07.119
and I shock my chest,

26:07.160 --> 26:10.721
and to my horror,
I have a heartbeat.

26:10.770 --> 26:12.067
(Chuckling)

26:12.100 --> 26:13.261
(Imitates heartbeat)

26:13.300 --> 26:14.836
It scared me
worse than a cop,

26:14.870 --> 26:16.099
<i>so 1 ran
as fast as I can.</i>

26:16.140 --> 26:18.359
Ran to a girlfriend's
house, Ruby Willis,

26:18.410 --> 26:19.764
and she opens the door

26:19.810 --> 26:21.232
and I'm freaking out

26:21.280 --> 26:23.374
because I got a dead ticker
doing cartwheels,

26:23.410 --> 26:26.710
so I tore her apart before
she had a chance to kiss me

26:26.750 --> 26:28.878
and got right
underneath that blanket.

26:28.920 --> 26:33.141
And that is what
we call...a close call.

26:35.390 --> 26:37.154
- (Robbie):
Sally, wait!

26:37.190 --> 26:39.682
- We already wasted enough time.
We have to start!

26:39.730 --> 26:41.858
- No, stop, OK?
Listen to me.

26:41.900 --> 26:43.959
I died last night,
and ever since then,

26:44.000 --> 26:47.220
you've just been running around
this house like a freak show,

26:47.270 --> 26:50.035
casually dropping hints
about vampires, werewolves

26:50.070 --> 26:53.836
and, apparently, popping
in and out of dimensions!

26:53.880 --> 26:54.972
Like, what the hell?

26:55.010 --> 26:56.637
- Yeah, it's been a day.

26:56.680 --> 26:58.079
- Do you ever stop and think

26:58.110 --> 27:00.670
that this might be a bit
much for me to deal with?

27:00.720 --> 27:02.279
It took Mom 10 years
to convince me

27:02.320 --> 27:03.913
that hamburgers
came from cows.

27:03.950 --> 27:06.419
- Yeah, well, Robbie,
all this running and popping,

27:06.450 --> 27:07.417
it's been for you!

27:07.450 --> 27:09.316
- So you keep saying.

27:09.360 --> 27:11.328
- Yeah, well,
I have Donna now!

27:11.360 --> 27:13.749
And we figured it out!
We can help you, so...

27:15.430 --> 27:16.727
- OK.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.023
- What?

27:18.070 --> 27:20.266
- I--I'm... I guess, OK.

27:20.300 --> 27:21.836
- OK.

27:21.870 --> 27:25.636
- Just... How did we
get here, you know?

27:26.870 --> 27:28.736
- OK. Yeah, yeah.

27:28.780 --> 27:32.375
** My heart was
on fire, by you... *

27:32.410 --> 27:36.119
After this all finishes,
when you get your body,

27:36.150 --> 27:38.812
you're not gonna
be able to see me.

27:38.850 --> 27:40.716
- Well, easy fix for that:

27:40.760 --> 27:43.457
I'll just get leather
jacket to bite me,

27:43.490 --> 27:46.790
turn me into a werewolf
or whatever, right?

27:46.830 --> 27:48.958
- That's not even funny!
That's not funny.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.149
- Now, she's serious.

27:50.200 --> 27:52.123
- Was that true, what
you said about Dad?

27:52.170 --> 27:53.865
Does he wanna
sell the house?

27:53.900 --> 27:56.289
* As long as I... *

27:56.340 --> 27:58.866
He doesn't
have it in him.

27:58.910 --> 28:00.730
He lost too much.

28:00.780 --> 28:02.805
I guess he must
hate this house

28:02.840 --> 28:04.842
just enough to
entrust it to me.

28:04.880 --> 28:07.178
* Got you... *

28:07.210 --> 28:11.044
- You know, on one of my pops,
um, I went back a couple years,

28:11.090 --> 28:14.082
to the day that Danny
and I moved into this house.

28:14.120 --> 28:16.009
Do you remember? You were...

28:16.060 --> 28:17.721
- I was a jerk!

28:17.760 --> 28:19.854
- Yeah, you were. Well...

28:19.890 --> 28:22.154
- You know,
after you died,

28:22.200 --> 28:24.999
I wished I could take
a lot of that stuff back.

28:26.330 --> 28:28.992
- Yeah, well, I heard
what you said to Danny.

28:30.340 --> 28:32.206
You stood up for me.

28:32.240 --> 28:34.777
- Danny always thought
I was a deadbeat.

28:34.810 --> 28:36.972
I--I figured he
would have told you.

28:37.010 --> 28:40.241
- No. No, he never told me.

28:42.320 --> 28:46.939
You know, when this is done,
you get to have your life back.

28:46.990 --> 28:48.913
You can do whatever you want!

28:48.960 --> 28:52.282
- I don't--I don't know
what I want anymore.

28:53.800 --> 28:57.054
I[--I--I screwed
everything up!

28:57.100 --> 28:59.091
It's all I ever do.

28:59.130 --> 29:00.325
- No, you can fix this!

29:00.370 --> 29:02.065
This is your chance!

29:02.100 --> 29:03.499
You can change things!

29:03.540 --> 29:05.338
* And for a while... *

29:05.370 --> 29:07.065
- You really think that?

29:07.110 --> 29:08.236
- Yes!

29:08.280 --> 29:10.135
I really do.

29:10.180 --> 29:13.275
<i>* 1 held it up for you *</i>

29:13.310 --> 29:14.846
I'm gonna miss you.

29:14.880 --> 29:18.987
* Go to sky, love... *

29:19.020 --> 29:20.249
- It's time.

29:23.490 --> 29:25.879
- I'll meet you...
I'll meet you downstairs.

29:28.000 --> 29:33.427
* Happy morning,
where... *

29:33.470 --> 29:36.770
- She's never gonna give up on
you. You know that, right?

29:37.840 --> 29:39.399
- Yeah, I know.

29:40.570 --> 29:42.038
She's the best.

29:42.080 --> 29:45.801
<i>* I found a Wight *</i>

29:45.850 --> 29:48.444
- This whole ghost thing,

29:48.480 --> 29:50.448
the whole responsibilities,

29:50.480 --> 29:55.054
the trick with the disappearing,
going wherever, whenever...

29:55.090 --> 29:57.479
* Counting the stars,
wondering where you are... *

29:57.520 --> 29:58.851
How do you like it?

29:58.890 --> 30:00.824
- Well, it
doesn't matter

30:00.860 --> 30:02.328
what I think of it.

30:03.500 --> 30:06.094
Your sister means
for you to live.

30:06.130 --> 30:09.339
It's up to you to
decide if you're worth it.

30:09.370 --> 30:12.567
* I wish I could stay *

30:12.610 --> 30:17.332
* I wish I could
stay, I wish I... *%*

30:26.150 --> 30:27.345
- You ready?

30:27.390 --> 30:30.485
- Yeah. I'm ready.

30:30.520 --> 30:32.420
But Robbie isn't.

30:32.460 --> 30:33.530
- What?

30:33.560 --> 30:35.927
- He's gone, Sally.
He took off.

30:35.960 --> 30:37.519
- What? Where--
Why would he--

30:37.560 --> 30:40.120
- Guessing it's
not the first time?

30:41.370 --> 30:42.360
- But...

30:42.400 --> 30:44.038
Wait, all of
our planning.

30:44.070 --> 30:47.233
I dragged you through
a trans-dimensional portal!

30:47.270 --> 30:48.578
We traveled through time!

30:48.610 --> 30:50.078
And you were willing to--

30:53.510 --> 30:57.048
Why would you leave?
Why would you do this?

30:57.080 --> 30:58.479
Where are you going?

30:58.520 --> 31:02.479
- He told me he wanted
to put an end to the cycle.

31:02.520 --> 31:07.128
Look, Sally, there's a
very specific kind of person

31:07.160 --> 31:09.151
who's relieved when
death finally comes.

31:09.200 --> 31:10.929
I've seen it.

31:10.970 --> 31:14.361
The stress of trying
over and over again,

31:14.400 --> 31:17.370
you know, trying
to get it right...

31:18.970 --> 31:20.506
it can be a lot.

31:22.410 --> 31:25.345
It can be too much.

31:25.380 --> 31:26.973
- I just wanted to help him.

31:27.010 --> 31:29.217
I just wanted to give
him another chance.

31:29.250 --> 31:30.649
- Well, you did.

31:31.650 --> 31:33.243
You tried.

31:47.070 --> 31:49.198
(Sighing)

32:05.020 --> 32:06.283
Sally!

32:07.990 --> 32:09.310
(Sighing)

32:09.360 --> 32:12.660
If you still have it in you,
I could use your help.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.227
- Are you sure
you wanna do this?

32:17.260 --> 32:19.365
Because, honestly,
seeing you in a petticoat

32:19.400 --> 32:21.334
has made me feel
strangely close to you.

32:21.370 --> 32:24.260
- If I stay, I won't be able
to resist the temptation

32:24.310 --> 32:25.368
to use my power.

32:25.410 --> 32:27.037
I don't want
to go back to that.

32:27.070 --> 32:28.276
- If I seal this,

32:28.310 --> 32:30.506
you'll never be able
to come back on this plane.

32:30.540 --> 32:32.747
- It's what I want.

32:32.780 --> 32:34.509
- What about
our girl talks?

32:36.120 --> 32:38.339
- You know, you
have grown on me.

32:38.390 --> 32:39.687
- Hal

32:40.690 --> 32:42.681
- But listen,
seriously.

32:42.720 --> 32:44.484
Promise me one thing?

32:44.530 --> 32:46.180
That this, right now,

32:46.230 --> 32:49.996
is the last time
that you use our magic.

32:50.030 --> 32:52.670
- Oh God! I mean,
I wanna promise you.

32:52.700 --> 32:54.429
I really wanna do that.

32:54.470 --> 32:58.361
But, like, since we're
laying this out on the table

32:58.410 --> 33:00.060
right now,
you and me,

33:00.110 --> 33:03.375
I really just don't
wanna lie to you anymore.

33:03.410 --> 33:07.074
Here's what I'll promise you:
Special occasions.

33:07.110 --> 33:11.047
Birthdays, Chanukah, now.

33:11.090 --> 33:12.216
How's that?

33:23.500 --> 33:25.161
(Sighing)

33:26.470 --> 33:28.359
(Speaking Latin)

33:33.210 --> 33:35.508
I hope you find peace.

33:38.350 --> 33:39.647
(Speaking Latin)

33:51.630 --> 33:53.189
Bye, Donna!

33:56.330 --> 33:58.594
You were one badass bitch.

34:01.870 --> 34:03.269
OK.

34:04.670 --> 34:06.536
Where to next?

34:11.580 --> 34:13.775
- Don't look so beaten.

34:13.810 --> 34:16.541
It wasn't all
carnage and horror.

34:16.580 --> 34:18.786
There were some nice
moments there too.

34:18.820 --> 34:20.844
Like this girl, Sophia,

34:20.889 --> 34:26.158
she had asked me to kill her
while making love with her.

34:26.190 --> 34:29.694
Which, you know, not
the first time that happened.

34:29.730 --> 34:32.391
But this one was special,

34:32.429 --> 34:34.431
because when she died,

34:34.469 --> 34:37.098
I looked out the window

34:37.139 --> 34:41.099
and there was this
great flock of birds.

34:42.310 --> 34:44.540
It was a beautiful death.

34:44.580 --> 34:46.309
It was victimless.

34:46.350 --> 34:48.170
- Victimless?

34:49.250 --> 34:50.342
It's not victimless!

34:50.380 --> 34:52.280
Someone missed her!
She had a life!

34:52.320 --> 34:53.549
- She didn't have a life!

34:53.590 --> 34:55.786
She didn't have friends.
No husband, no child.

35:00.360 --> 35:01.555
There was a child.

35:04.670 --> 35:09.392
And then, I remember
thinking of you.

35:11.910 --> 35:14.299
I could see
your face. I--I...

35:15.340 --> 35:16.808
(Sighing)

35:16.840 --> 35:21.539
Wondered what you might think of
me, how horrified you would be.

35:24.220 --> 35:26.643
Suzanna, please...

35:26.690 --> 35:29.159
- I wouldn't have
made you go through this

35:29.190 --> 35:31.158
if I hadn't gone
through it myself.

35:31.190 --> 35:33.625
Suzanna, you have
to forgive me.

35:33.660 --> 35:35.754
Please, please forgive me.

35:35.800 --> 35:37.620
(Siren wailing in distance)

35:41.640 --> 35:43.893
- How can I forgive you

35:43.940 --> 35:48.332
when I don't think you fully
understand what you've done?

35:48.380 --> 35:49.404
- I am filth.

35:49.440 --> 35:51.750
And you have never met anyone

35:51.780 --> 35:54.613
who has hated
so much what he is.

35:55.820 --> 35:58.482
And that's why
you gave me hope.

35:59.520 --> 36:00.612
Please...

36:00.650 --> 36:01.879
(Aidan sobbing)

36:01.920 --> 36:03.786
Please forgive me.

36:05.560 --> 36:07.619
Someone has
to forgive me.

36:09.860 --> 36:11.191
- Enough!

36:11.230 --> 36:12.391
(Sobbing)

36:19.010 --> 36:22.640
I have a name
to give you as well.

36:23.740 --> 36:26.539
That of my
very first kill.

36:28.550 --> 36:30.746
The name, it still tortures me.

36:36.620 --> 36:39.226
It's Isaac.

36:41.030 --> 36:42.759
I murdered our son!

36:50.370 --> 36:51.906
- What?

36:53.640 --> 36:55.506
That can't be! Y-you...

36:56.980 --> 37:00.746
That's not true. You told me
that Isaac died a grandfather.

37:00.780 --> 37:02.509
- I lied.

37:05.320 --> 37:08.255
And because of what we are,

37:08.290 --> 37:12.955
I drained every last drop
from his tiny body.

37:12.990 --> 37:14.754
- No!

37:14.800 --> 37:17.394
Not Isaac! Not Isaac!

37:20.930 --> 37:25.766
(No audio)

37:45.360 --> 37:46.782
(No audio)

38:07.510 --> 38:09.547
(Insects chirping)

38:32.410 --> 38:35.505
(* Woman vocalizing )

38:44.390 --> 38:46.518
- I couldn't sleep.

39:00.030 --> 39:05.764
** Who the hell
will you die for? *

39:07.040 --> 39:10.499
* And will you die for *

39:10.540 --> 39:14.670
* The love you can hope for **

39:14.720 --> 39:16.643
- You should go.

39:16.680 --> 39:18.489
(Inhaling deeply)

39:18.520 --> 39:20.113
You should go.

39:49.550 --> 39:51.018
Oh, Josh!

39:53.450 --> 39:55.657
You should go downstairs.

39:56.890 --> 39:58.779
You should go back downstairs.

39:58.830 --> 39:59.888
- I know, I know.

40:01.460 --> 40:02.689
- This is a bad idea.

40:02.730 --> 40:03.697
- It's fine.

40:03.730 --> 40:04.868
- No, please, please.

40:04.900 --> 40:07.198
No, please. I want
you to go downstairs.

40:07.230 --> 40:08.197
- No, please.

40:08.230 --> 40:09.561
- Enough, please.

40:09.600 --> 40:11.432
(Grunting)

40:11.470 --> 40:14.770
- Stop-- No, Josh! Josh,
stop! Stop it! Get off of me!

40:16.140 --> 40:19.075
Oh my God!
Get away from me!

40:19.110 --> 40:23.843
Christ! Get out!
Just get out!

40:23.880 --> 40:25.985
- Oh my God!
- I don't know what you are.

40:26.020 --> 40:28.216
- I'm so...
- Get out!

40:28.250 --> 40:32.460
- I'm so sorry! Oh my God!

40:32.490 --> 40:34.128
(Gasping)

40:46.570 --> 40:47.605
- Please don't go.

40:51.140 --> 40:53.643
- I'm scared, Josh.

40:55.550 --> 40:57.109
I'm scared of you.

41:00.550 --> 41:03.190
Find a way to deal
with what you are,

41:03.220 --> 41:05.450
"cause I can't.

41:12.100 --> 41:13.192
(Door slamming)

41:18.670 --> 41:20.536
- Four years, Malik.

41:20.570 --> 41:21.833
Four years.

41:21.880 --> 41:24.599
Do you have any idea how
much longer those years feel

41:24.650 --> 41:29.076
when I'm watching you stumble
through your doomed relationship

41:29.120 --> 41:31.680
and your obsession
with oral hygiene,

41:31.720 --> 41:33.210
day in and day out?

41:33.250 --> 41:36.982
Oh my God, I'm stuck here!
I'm stuck here!

41:37.020 --> 41:38.784
Donna was right.
The tether snapped.

41:38.830 --> 41:39.820
I'm stuck here.

41:39.860 --> 41:41.828
<i>Tm never going home!</i>

41:43.930 --> 41:46.695
There's gotta be a way
to get through to you.

41:46.730 --> 41:49.097
I can't live
like this, Sally!

41:49.140 --> 41:50.733
I can't live here!

41:50.770 --> 41:53.535
Am I really meant
to be reliving this

41:53.570 --> 41:55.709
for all freaking eternity?

41:58.950 --> 42:00.907
(Clears throat)

42:05.690 --> 42:06.942
Oh my God!

42:12.360 --> 42:13.725
- Damn it!

42:13.760 --> 42:15.854
- This is the
night I die!

42:15.900 --> 42:17.595
- Oh my God!

42:19.230 --> 42:21.597
- Oh my God! Oh my God!

42:21.640 --> 42:23.563
- (Danny):
Sally, where are you?

42:23.600 --> 42:27.332
- You gotta run. He's coming.
Run! He's coming!

42:27.370 --> 42:31.273
- Hey! Thought we were
watching a movie.

42:34.310 --> 42:35.744
(Sighing)

42:35.780 --> 42:37.270
- He's gonna kill you.
