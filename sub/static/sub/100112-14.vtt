<b>2x14 - Bad Dads and Grads</b>

00:04.090 --> 00:05.249
- Hey.
- Hi.

00:05.250 --> 00:07.209
How do I look for my date?

00:07.210 --> 00:09.709
I-I want my outfit to say
that I'm available

00:09.710 --> 00:11.539
but not too available,

00:11.540 --> 00:14.539
and that I'm 64
but I have the sex drive

00:14.540 --> 00:16.880
of a 40-year-old
who's newly married.

00:19.170 --> 00:22.999
You look great.
Just be calm and be yourself.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.709
If you have to choose one,
be calm.

00:24.710 --> 00:28.879
Okay. It's really
scary getting back out there.

00:28.880 --> 00:31.089
And you have to find
the right dating app.

00:31.090 --> 00:33.749
I started off with one that
I thought sounded appropriate

00:33.750 --> 00:37.089
for a woman my age...
Precious Little Time.

00:37.090 --> 00:39.749
Which I thought meant that
you wouldn't waste time

00:39.750 --> 00:41.539
with people who
weren't right for you.

00:41.540 --> 00:43.669
But it turns out, it's
for the terminally ill

00:43.670 --> 00:46.419
who are still sexually active.

00:46.420 --> 00:49.789
Well, you know those people are
gonna want to do the freaky stuff.

00:49.790 --> 00:51.879
Nobody wants to die in
the missionary position.

00:51.880 --> 00:55.459
- Uh-huh.
- Hey-ey.

00:55.460 --> 00:58.209
What do you have for being
underweight and depressed?

00:58.210 --> 01:00.749
Wow, I guess somebody
got a glimpse of themselves

01:00.750 --> 01:03.329
in the window on the way over.

01:03.330 --> 01:05.289
No, I was at Planned Parenthood,

01:05.290 --> 01:07.459
which is a good place
to go if you're poor

01:07.460 --> 01:09.129
and actually planning
for parenthood.

01:09.130 --> 01:11.749
You and Ben are having a baby?!

01:11.750 --> 01:15.290
Smart move!
Lock that hunk of Grade A down.

01:16.920 --> 01:19.089
First of all, it was Ben's idea.

01:19.090 --> 01:20.770
Second of all, we're just
talking about it.

01:20.771 --> 01:22.520
I just wanted to see
if I'm healthy enough.

01:22.521 --> 01:25.129
- And are you?
- Oh, God, no.

01:25.130 --> 01:27.749
I'm out of shape,
my blood is iron poor,

01:27.750 --> 01:29.629
and my vitamin levels
are too low.

01:29.630 --> 01:32.498
Is that from being vegan?

01:33.170 --> 01:36.709
No.
Healthy vegans are fine.

01:36.710 --> 01:38.289
But I'm a trash vegan.

01:38.290 --> 01:41.329
It turns out coconut caramel
fudge swirl soy ice cream

01:41.330 --> 01:44.156
is not the building block
of a healthy diet.

02:25.830 --> 02:28.499
Hey. You guys left Grandpa Ed's
a few hours ago.

02:28.500 --> 02:29.749
What took so long?

02:29.750 --> 02:32.879
Well, I took him to that
abandoned mall parking lot,

02:32.880 --> 02:35.459
taught him how to do ice donuts.

02:35.460 --> 02:39.169
We skidded out of the parking
lot onto the sidewalk.

02:39.170 --> 02:41.249
Scared the hell out of that
mom with that stroller.

02:41.250 --> 02:42.850
Shh!

02:43.960 --> 02:46.539
Found a box of Dan's
childhood stuff at the house.

02:46.540 --> 02:49.190
Oh, wow.
I've never seen anything

02:49.191 --> 02:50.170
from when you were a kid.

02:50.194 --> 02:52.129
I can't believe
your dad held on to this.

02:52.130 --> 02:53.749
I don't think he wanted
to hang on to it.

02:53.750 --> 02:55.879
"Anything in this box, 50 cents"

02:55.880 --> 02:59.496
gives you a pretty good idea
of his emotional attachment.

02:59.542 --> 03:02.070
I tried to give him the old man's
car, but he wouldn't take it.

03:02.094 --> 03:03.289
I don't want his car.

03:03.290 --> 03:05.629
He treated the car
better than he treated me.

03:05.630 --> 03:07.129
This may come as
a shock to you all,

03:07.130 --> 03:08.419
'cause he hides it so well, but

03:08.420 --> 03:10.959
Dan didn't have the best
relationship with our dad.

03:10.960 --> 03:12.789
- What? What?!
- What? No!

03:12.790 --> 03:15.379
You got me there, Bub.

03:15.380 --> 03:17.420
You want a cup of coffee
and some cookies, Uncle Ed?

03:17.444 --> 03:19.289
Yeah. And you don't
have to call me Uncle.

03:19.290 --> 03:20.956
Makes me feel old.

03:21.030 --> 03:23.525
Here's your coffee, Uncle Ed!

03:26.440 --> 03:30.585
Is this cookie
soft enough for your dentures?!

03:31.530 --> 03:34.109
Have your fun. I'll pretend
to be the old uncle.

03:34.110 --> 03:36.729
Oh, he's confused again!

03:36.730 --> 03:40.189
He doesn't know that
he's related to us!

03:40.730 --> 03:42.779
Hey! You guys
should knock it off.

03:42.780 --> 03:44.569
He's barely related to us.

03:44.570 --> 03:48.170
No, Harris, we talked about this.
You cannot date your uncle.

03:49.440 --> 03:53.019
I'm so sick of this family
and all of its crazy rules.

03:53.990 --> 03:55.989
What's this?
Can I have it?

03:55.990 --> 03:57.359
Stop being so rude.

03:57.360 --> 04:00.689
- I want it.
- What is it?

04:00.690 --> 04:02.770
It's nothing. That's mine.
I-It shouldn't be in here.

04:02.794 --> 04:05.939
Oh! That's not nothing.
It's your college diploma.

04:05.940 --> 04:08.069
You didn't mention
you went to college.

04:08.070 --> 04:09.729
It's no big deal.

04:09.730 --> 04:12.439
- What'd you major in?
- Environmental Science.

04:12.440 --> 04:14.956
Ooh, I hope
the government brings that back.

04:16.399 --> 04:18.608
I hope those jobs pay good.

04:18.610 --> 04:21.228
You got to be drowning in
student loans, huh?

04:21.230 --> 04:22.940
I'll be alright.

04:25.780 --> 04:28.140
Hey, do that thing when I'm old
again and I can't hear good.

04:28.164 --> 04:29.764
That was really funny.

04:30.070 --> 04:32.070
The old man paid for
your college, didn't he?

04:33.490 --> 04:35.939
Yeah, he did.

04:37.190 --> 04:39.330
Good for you.

04:54.730 --> 04:57.770
You think you would
be more comfortable waiting at the bar?

04:57.794 --> 05:00.460
Mm-hm. You can drop the
phony French accent, Pete.

05:00.484 --> 05:01.989
I don't know
if you remember this,

05:01.990 --> 05:04.689
but I used to babysit you
when you were, say, "cinq."

05:04.690 --> 05:06.570
So you're not getting the table.

05:12.570 --> 05:14.170
<i>Merci, garÃ§on.</i>

05:15.150 --> 05:16.989
I can't believe how
rude they're being

05:16.990 --> 05:19.279
just because your friend
is a little delayed.

05:19.280 --> 05:20.819
Would you care to join us?

05:20.820 --> 05:22.529
Oh, no, that's very nice of you,

05:22.530 --> 05:24.319
but my date should be
here any second.

05:24.320 --> 05:25.779
He's a teacher,

05:25.780 --> 05:28.649
so he's probably turning
some child's life around.

05:28.650 --> 05:31.529
Of course.
But it'd be our pleasure.

05:31.530 --> 05:33.359
And you could
break the tie for us.

05:33.360 --> 05:35.989
We're having a debate about
that couple over there.

05:35.990 --> 05:38.399
I say esteemed publisher
and aspiring young novelist.

05:38.400 --> 05:40.069
I say hooker and john.

05:41.440 --> 05:43.189
Oh, there's no way
that man's a hooker.

05:47.190 --> 05:48.859
Hey.

05:48.860 --> 05:50.399
Uh, ok...
Well, I-I don't know.

05:50.400 --> 05:51.880
I guess I could join you.

05:51.904 --> 05:54.609
This is the first time I've
tried using a dating app.

05:54.610 --> 05:57.649
Oh, those apps have changed
everything, right?

05:57.650 --> 06:00.729
I can turn the light on
in my guest bedroom.

06:00.730 --> 06:02.609
Watch this.

06:02.610 --> 06:03.939
- Hmm.
- Uh-oh!

06:03.940 --> 06:05.569
I just opened the garage door.

06:05.570 --> 06:06.819
Uh-oh.

06:06.820 --> 06:08.229
There go the cats.

06:09.231 --> 06:10.399
Fix this, would you, honey?

06:11.820 --> 06:13.399
Oh, crap. I started the car.

06:13.400 --> 06:16.684
Well, it's good
the garage door is open.

06:17.570 --> 06:20.650
- You two are so cute.
- We are, right?

06:21.860 --> 06:23.229
By the way, I'm Ron.

06:23.230 --> 06:25.150
This is my lovely bride
of thirty years, Janelle.

06:25.174 --> 06:26.036
- Oh.
- Hi.

06:26.037 --> 06:26.899
Hi. I'm Jackie.

06:26.900 --> 06:28.900
And I want to buy both of you
another glass of wine

06:28.924 --> 06:31.229
for being so kind to me.

06:31.230 --> 06:33.689
Oh, they have my favorite
wine... "house."

06:35.150 --> 06:37.030
Alright, but if you're
gonna be buying the wine,

06:37.031 --> 06:39.351
then you're gonna have to join
us for karaoke after dinner.

06:39.375 --> 06:40.729
Oh, I love karaoke!

06:40.730 --> 06:42.399
I do a fantastic "Thriller."

06:42.400 --> 06:44.609
You know, not many people
do the dance moves.

06:44.610 --> 06:47.029
That's great!

06:47.030 --> 06:49.189
We finally have a third
for "Love Shack"!

06:49.190 --> 06:53.029
- Ohh!
- ♪ The love shack, baby, yeah ♪

06:53.030 --> 06:55.729
Love shack, baby!

06:55.730 --> 06:59.569
My God, is it just me, or do we
sound better than the original?

06:59.570 --> 07:01.189
Just you.

07:05.440 --> 07:08.690
Thanks for keeping an eye
on Aunt Darlene.

07:10.780 --> 07:12.859
She's doing girl push-ups?

07:12.860 --> 07:15.939
I thought you had to be
a girl to do those.

07:15.940 --> 07:19.649
Tell Beverly Rose to get off my
ass. I'm doing the best I can.

07:19.650 --> 07:21.069
You know, if you
just tell your kids

07:21.070 --> 07:22.819
that you're thinking
about having a baby,

07:22.820 --> 07:26.319
you could work out in front of
the TV, like a normal person.

07:26.320 --> 07:29.489
It's not worth answering all
those questions until it's real.

07:29.490 --> 07:31.029
Plus, I'm trying to
avoid junk food,

07:31.030 --> 07:33.609
and most of it's
in the carpet downstairs.

07:34.650 --> 07:36.439
Hey.
You got a minute?

07:36.440 --> 07:39.109
Hey, Harris.
What are you doing up here?

07:39.110 --> 07:41.149
I came to see which insurance
plan you have for me.

07:41.150 --> 07:43.399
I can buy one at work,
and I wanna see if it's better.

07:43.400 --> 07:48.090
Okay, well, you don't have
one here, so that one's better.

07:49.280 --> 07:52.229
What were you doing on the
floor? Were you exercising?

07:52.230 --> 07:55.279
- You never exercise.
- Hey, your mother was an athlete.

07:55.280 --> 07:57.859
When she was a kid,
she played basketball.

07:57.860 --> 08:00.109
You're 2 feet tall.

08:00.110 --> 08:02.981
Who would you play against,
Alvin and the Chipmunks?

08:03.650 --> 08:05.569
Seriously, why are you doing this?

08:05.570 --> 08:08.415
I... just want to get swole, dawg.

08:09.650 --> 08:13.149
Ew. You'll tell me the
truth, right, Becky?

08:13.150 --> 08:15.029
Come on, Beverly Rose.

08:15.030 --> 08:17.676
Nothing good is gonna
happen here.

08:18.360 --> 08:19.960
Thank you, Becky.

08:22.780 --> 08:25.149
Alright, um...

08:25.150 --> 08:29.279
you're mature enough for me
to just put this out there.

08:29.280 --> 08:33.400
Ben and I are...
thinking about having a baby.

08:34.440 --> 08:36.039
How do you feel about that?

08:37.110 --> 08:40.489
You're old
and it's embarrassing, but...

08:40.490 --> 08:42.650
I don't care, 'cause I don't
have to live here anymore.

08:43.940 --> 08:46.652
Let's always talk.
Just like this.

08:47.070 --> 08:48.730
If I'm not doing anything else.

08:52.190 --> 08:54.310
I know you took the good
bath towel to your apartment.

08:54.334 --> 08:55.359
Bring it back.

08:55.360 --> 08:57.819
You got
bigger problems than that.

08:57.820 --> 09:00.229
Mom and Ben
are gonna have a baby.

09:00.230 --> 09:05.109
- What?! Why?!
- Because she's insane.

09:05.110 --> 09:07.400
She's like a thousand years old
and frail.

09:09.070 --> 09:10.859
Well, then I got to
tell her not to do it.

09:10.860 --> 09:12.399
She doesn't care what you say.

09:12.400 --> 09:14.319
Mom's having a new baby.
You're out.

09:19.340 --> 09:21.999
Wow! Are those
from the math teacher?

09:22.000 --> 09:23.759
No!
He stood me up.

09:23.760 --> 09:25.209
Oh, they're...

09:25.210 --> 09:26.880
they're from Ron and Janelle.

09:28.090 --> 09:30.169
A nice couple I met
who let me sit at their table

09:30.170 --> 09:31.879
so I wouldn't be humiliated.

09:31.880 --> 09:35.259
A couple sent you flowers?
That's odd.

09:35.260 --> 09:36.860
Where else did you sit?

09:37.840 --> 09:40.049
Oh, stop that.
They're nice people.

09:40.050 --> 09:41.499
We had fun together.

09:41.500 --> 09:43.379
They sent you red roses.

09:43.380 --> 09:45.589
- That's romantic.
- Don't be ridiculo...

09:45.590 --> 09:47.299
They've been married
for thirty years.

09:47.300 --> 09:49.710
They're regular
one-person-at-a-time people.

09:50.960 --> 09:54.209
"Can't wait to visit
the Love Shack with you again"?

09:54.210 --> 09:56.959
Sounds like pile-of-people-
at-a-time people.

09:56.960 --> 10:00.049
Oh, my God,
we sang that song at karaoke.

10:00.050 --> 10:01.759
And then we went
and got hot chocolate,

10:01.760 --> 10:04.669
and then we walked along
the Lanford River,

10:04.670 --> 10:06.299
and then they walked me
to my car,

10:06.300 --> 10:07.879
and they said they
had a wonderful time

10:07.880 --> 10:09.670
and that they'd like
to see me again.

10:11.460 --> 10:14.959
That's a date. They want
you to be part of a thrupple.

10:14.960 --> 10:17.980
What? No, they don't!
What is that?

10:18.500 --> 10:22.709
It's the fun of a threesome with
the drudgery of a relationship.

10:22.710 --> 10:24.759
Becky, I'm not gonna stand here

10:24.760 --> 10:26.259
and listen to you
jump to conclusions.

10:26.260 --> 10:28.999
I have to get ready to meet
them at dance class.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.380
The three of us
are going to tango.

10:35.800 --> 10:36.959
See ya!

10:39.260 --> 10:40.959
Hey, buddy.

10:40.960 --> 10:44.879
- Ready for a little piano lesson?
- No. I wanna talk to you.

10:44.880 --> 10:47.049
Why are you forcing
my mom to have a baby?

10:47.050 --> 10:49.339
Whoa!

10:49.340 --> 10:51.879
I... don't know who told you that,

10:51.880 --> 10:54.799
but I am not forcing
your mom to have a baby.

10:54.800 --> 10:56.400
Is she forcing you?

10:58.960 --> 11:03.339
- Well, no.
- It had to be somebody's idea.

11:03.340 --> 11:05.089
Nobody just does that
kind of thing for fun.

11:07.300 --> 11:08.900
Ahh.

11:11.710 --> 11:14.919
All I can say is that
we love each other, okay?

11:14.920 --> 11:17.169
And we're just thinking
about having a baby.

11:17.170 --> 11:18.629
You're a liar.

11:18.630 --> 11:21.129
She's not gonna turn down
having a baby with you.

11:21.130 --> 11:22.760
You're the hottest guy
she's ever dated.

11:25.590 --> 11:28.919
Hey, the liar comment is hurtful.

11:28.920 --> 11:33.499
But... I can't argue
with you that...

11:33.500 --> 11:35.460
I am the hottest guy
she's ever dated.

11:37.300 --> 11:40.839
- It's weird when you say it.
- Okay, but, look, I am pretty sure

11:40.840 --> 11:43.080
that your mom does not want me
talking to you about this.

11:43.104 --> 11:46.339
But...
I'm just gonna go on and...

11:46.340 --> 11:48.879
jump into the old "dad waters"
for the first time here.

11:50.500 --> 11:55.259
Uh... you're worried
that if we have a new baby

11:55.260 --> 11:57.299
that you won't have a place
in this family.

11:57.300 --> 11:58.669
But you will.

11:58.670 --> 12:00.919
You'll be a big brother,
hot shot.

12:00.920 --> 12:03.420
"Dad waters" is not a thing,
you idiot.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.360
Don't tell your mom we talked.

12:09.590 --> 12:12.449
Or that I said "dad waters."

12:15.550 --> 12:17.499
What are you doing here?

12:17.500 --> 12:20.419
You're supposed to be helping
Ed Jr. over at your dad's house.

12:20.420 --> 12:22.379
We pretty much
finished the drywall.

12:22.380 --> 12:26.299
He can handle it from there.
He's a smart kid.

12:26.300 --> 12:32.209
- He went to college.
- Oh, so, that's what this is about.

12:32.210 --> 12:36.169
I saw your face when Ed Jr. said
Grandpa paid for his college.

12:36.170 --> 12:39.589
You're so good at reading my
face, what's it saying now?

12:39.590 --> 12:43.919
It says you think you
got a raw deal.

12:43.920 --> 12:47.209
And your eyebrow
is telling me you want pie.

12:47.210 --> 12:49.550
Eh, that's easy.
I always want pie.

12:50.800 --> 12:52.499
Nope.

12:52.500 --> 12:55.089
You can't eat your feelings
until you tell me what they are.

12:55.090 --> 12:57.959
I don't have any feelings.
You know that.

12:57.960 --> 12:59.209
Uh-oh!

12:59.210 --> 13:01.999
Looks like I have
a heavy whipped cream finger!

13:02.000 --> 13:06.169
Okay, okay! It would have
been nice to go to college.

13:06.170 --> 13:08.379
You never talked about
wanting to go to college.

13:08.380 --> 13:10.169
There's a lot of things
I don't talk about.

13:10.170 --> 13:12.550
I'm only talking about it now
because of the pie.

13:15.170 --> 13:17.800
- I wanted to design cars.
- Really?

13:17.801 --> 13:21.919
All through high school, I filled
up notebooks with my design.

13:21.920 --> 13:23.959
My art teacher thought
I really had something.

13:23.960 --> 13:26.669
But the old man
wouldn't give me a dime.

13:26.670 --> 13:28.589
Said I wasn't college material.

13:28.590 --> 13:31.879
- Like he'd know.
- So what?

13:31.880 --> 13:34.799
You're gonna punish Ed Jr.
every time you hear

13:34.800 --> 13:37.169
about something nice
your dad did for him?

13:37.170 --> 13:38.799
'Cause that's not his fault.

13:38.800 --> 13:40.799
I know I should let it go,
but I can't.

13:40.800 --> 13:43.259
And if I don't, I'm gonna wreck
my relationship with the kid.

13:44.710 --> 13:47.879
The only way to let it all go is

13:47.880 --> 13:49.999
to get some kind of closure
with your dad.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.129
Yeah...

13:52.130 --> 13:54.590
Man, it'd be so much easier
if he was still alive.

13:57.050 --> 14:00.339
I could sit down with him,
hear his side of it,

14:00.340 --> 14:02.999
and punch him right in the face.

14:06.100 --> 14:08.769
It was awful nice of you
to treat me to this.

14:08.770 --> 14:10.770
I don't know when's the last
time I had a pedicure.

14:10.794 --> 14:13.729
They took off so much dead skin
I think I went down a shoe size.

14:16.310 --> 14:18.479
Listen, you guys have paid
for everything this week,

14:18.480 --> 14:20.849
and I'm starting to feel
like maybe I owe you,

14:20.850 --> 14:23.310
hmm, I don't know, money.

14:25.350 --> 14:28.689
Nonsense. It's nice to
have someone to spoil.

14:28.690 --> 14:31.389
Our kids are grown, and, well,
we don't like them.

14:33.060 --> 14:36.190
And we just can't imagine
not having you around.

14:38.230 --> 14:40.758
Oh, would you look at that.

14:42.810 --> 14:45.649
Jackie, this is awkward because
we've never done this before,

14:45.650 --> 14:47.309
so we're just gonna say it.

14:47.310 --> 14:49.439
We want to invite you into
our relationship.

14:49.440 --> 14:52.270
Which right now feels like the
most natural thing in the world.

14:53.650 --> 14:55.250
Uh...

14:57.890 --> 15:00.809
There's the other one.

15:00.810 --> 15:03.099
So, we were looking for
the right person,

15:03.100 --> 15:05.769
and then, out of the blue,
you found us.

15:05.770 --> 15:08.774
Oh. Well, I've never found
an "us" before, but

15:08.809 --> 15:11.423
here "us" is.

15:12.230 --> 15:15.689
- It's kind of a surprise.
- Really?

15:15.690 --> 15:18.269
The red roses,
the Love Shack, the locket...?

15:18.270 --> 15:19.849
Oh, this is a locket?

15:19.850 --> 15:22.099
Oh, and it opens up!

15:22.100 --> 15:24.811
And there's the three of us.

15:26.480 --> 15:27.889
So, what do you say, Jackie?

15:27.890 --> 15:29.479
Do you have room
in your life for us?

15:29.480 --> 15:31.939
Well, it's...
it's a big decision.

15:31.940 --> 15:33.849
Do I have a little time
to think about it?

15:33.850 --> 15:35.939
- Of course.
- It's important to us

15:35.940 --> 15:37.849
that you want this
as much as we do.

15:37.850 --> 15:40.689
Well, I will say, if I brought
you both home to meet my mother,

15:40.690 --> 15:42.979
it would kill her, so

15:42.980 --> 15:45.439
that's a big check in
the plus column...

15:48.020 --> 15:49.939
Oh, you are so...

15:53.690 --> 15:55.389
Hey, buddy.
Whatcha doing?

15:55.390 --> 15:57.775
Stress-ironing.

16:00.650 --> 16:03.269
I talked to Ben, and he told me

16:03.270 --> 16:05.979
that you're worried about
a new baby coming into our lives

16:05.980 --> 16:07.389
and what that means for you.

16:07.390 --> 16:11.889
And I just want to tell you
that everything is gonna be fine.

16:11.890 --> 16:15.810
- You're gonna die.
- What?

16:18.650 --> 16:20.939
Women in their forties
have the highest risk

16:20.940 --> 16:22.689
of dying in childbirth.

16:22.690 --> 16:24.599
Strokes, kidney failure,
hemorrhaging,

16:24.600 --> 16:26.809
infections, pre-eclampsia...

16:26.810 --> 16:29.485
Don't know what that is, but it
happens right before eclampsia.

16:31.980 --> 16:34.519
Alright. Slow down.

16:34.520 --> 16:35.649
Where did you get this?

16:35.650 --> 16:38.189
There's a lot of crazy
stuff on the Internet.

16:38.190 --> 16:41.059
The Mayo Clinic, the American
Medical Association,

16:41.060 --> 16:42.850
and the National
Institutes of Health.

16:44.350 --> 16:46.897
Oh. Maybe I better
have a look at that.

16:47.600 --> 16:49.099
Well, what happens if you die

16:49.100 --> 16:52.559
and I-I hate the baby
because it killed you?

16:52.560 --> 16:55.439
And then I have to take care
of a baby that I hate?

16:55.440 --> 16:58.592
You think I'm gonna send
a kid like that to college?

16:59.230 --> 17:02.229
Mark, take a breath, okay?

17:05.060 --> 17:07.476
I'm not gonna die.
Alright?

17:07.511 --> 17:09.848
I'm a Conner.
We don't just drop dead.

17:09.849 --> 17:12.848
We break down early,
and we linger

17:12.849 --> 17:15.769
so that we're a burden
to the next generation.

17:16.520 --> 17:18.848
Nana Bev is a burden
to Aunt Jackie,

17:18.849 --> 17:21.019
your grandpa will be
a burden to me,

17:21.020 --> 17:25.464
and I will be a burden to you
for a long, long time.

17:26.150 --> 17:29.059
You can't guarantee that
you're gonna be okay.

17:29.060 --> 17:31.689
Mark, look, the numbers
say the odds of me

17:31.690 --> 17:35.809
dying in childbirth are
one-hundredth of one-percent.

17:35.810 --> 17:39.149
- Guess that's not a lot.
- Yeah.

17:39.150 --> 17:43.229
You're totally worried
about the wrong thing. Okay?

17:43.230 --> 17:45.099
You don't need to
worry about me dying.

17:45.100 --> 17:49.069
It's much more likely that I'll
love the new baby more than you.

17:50.940 --> 17:52.099
Seriously?

17:52.100 --> 17:53.479
Look at me.
That's not possible.

17:53.480 --> 17:56.229
Uh, how do you know?

17:56.230 --> 17:57.649
We haven't seen the baby yet.

17:57.650 --> 18:00.651
And Ben is the hottest guy
I've ever dated.

18:03.770 --> 18:05.849
Okay.
This was Dad's spot.

18:07.810 --> 18:10.649
You gonna tell me why we drove all
the way out here in Dad's car?

18:10.650 --> 18:13.269
I just wanted to see where he
used to come to sit and think.

18:13.270 --> 18:16.309
I get it.
It's so deserted,

18:16.310 --> 18:18.480
you could scream out here
and nobody'd hear ya.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.200
Okay.

18:23.770 --> 18:27.269
Look, I know you're really mad
about the whole college thing.

18:27.270 --> 18:30.349
Yeah, I got to tell you,
it got to me.

18:30.350 --> 18:33.019
Every time I hear about all
the good stuff he did for you,

18:33.020 --> 18:37.019
all this rage and resentment
comes boiling up again.

18:37.020 --> 18:39.621
- I gotta put an end to it.
- Alright, look,

18:39.656 --> 18:41.309
it is not
my fault what he did for me.

18:41.310 --> 18:43.519
Alright, but if you wanna go,

18:43.520 --> 18:46.269
take your best shot,
but I'm a biter.

18:49.100 --> 18:51.149
I didn't come here to fight you.

18:51.150 --> 18:54.269
I appreciate you giving me
the car, man.

18:54.270 --> 18:55.979
Well, why don't we go
back into the car,

18:55.980 --> 18:57.689
where it's warm,
and talk about it?

18:57.690 --> 19:01.189
No can do.
I already lit the fuse.

19:04.270 --> 19:06.472
What?

19:06.690 --> 19:10.309
I loaded up the trunk with fireworks,
illegal stuff from Michigan.

19:10.310 --> 19:13.059
I got something called
a Patriot's Candle.

19:13.060 --> 19:15.844
It's basically just
a stick of dynamite.

19:16.520 --> 19:18.059
So, we drove all
the way out here

19:18.060 --> 19:21.379
with a trunk full of explosives?

19:24.440 --> 19:29.269
- Holy crap, that's really cool.
- Yeah, it was.

19:29.270 --> 19:30.870
I feel better.

19:32.230 --> 19:35.809
Just had to exorcise
some demons.

19:35.810 --> 19:39.019
I had to get closure with Dad

19:39.020 --> 19:42.559
to keep him from screwing up
our relationship.

19:42.560 --> 19:45.239
And he loved that car.

19:48.600 --> 19:50.200
Hey.

19:53.440 --> 19:55.059
<i>Whoo!</i>

19:55.060 --> 19:57.729
What?
Stop!

19:57.730 --> 19:59.059
It's just me.

19:59.060 --> 20:02.189
Ron and Janelle paid for it,
but, uh...

20:02.190 --> 20:05.479
Becky, you were right.
They want a thrupple.

20:05.480 --> 20:07.349
I'm guessing that's a couple

20:07.350 --> 20:09.849
plus one person who's wearing
someone else's hair?

20:09.850 --> 20:13.599
No. It's when three people
have an equal relationship,

20:13.600 --> 20:15.019
just like a couple.

20:15.020 --> 20:18.019
- Are you actually considering this?
- Maybe.

20:18.020 --> 20:20.559
I mean, they're fun,
they treat me with respect.

20:20.560 --> 20:22.349
When's the last time I had that?

20:22.350 --> 20:24.439
I think that Ron and Janelle

20:24.440 --> 20:27.456
might be the person I've been
looking for all this time.

20:29.060 --> 20:30.979
Are you sure you're ready for this?

20:30.980 --> 20:33.849
What happens when Ron wants
to have sex with you?

20:33.850 --> 20:35.729
Or Janelle?

20:35.730 --> 20:39.349
- Or Ron and Janelle?
- Um...

20:39.350 --> 20:41.599
I'll deal with that when
we go up to our lake house

20:41.600 --> 20:44.004
in Door County next weekend.

20:49.290 --> 20:53.419
You know, it's a shame there's no pictures
of us together when I was a baby.

20:53.420 --> 20:56.209
I remember
the first time I babysat you.

20:56.210 --> 20:57.810
You were easy.

20:58.460 --> 21:01.379
D.J., see if there's any
frozen waffles in the freezer.

21:03.750 --> 21:06.669
Crystal's list didn't say
anything about frozen waffles.

21:06.670 --> 21:09.339
That's because
she doesn't know the secret.

21:09.340 --> 21:11.089
There you go.

21:11.090 --> 21:13.839
Chew on this for a while, Little Ed.

21:13.840 --> 21:17.589
Yeah, that's gonna make
those gums feel better. Hmm?

21:17.590 --> 21:20.919
Ugh.
He's slobbering.

21:20.920 --> 21:22.379
Well, that's why I use a waffle.

21:22.380 --> 21:25.460
It's got all those
built-in drool cups.
