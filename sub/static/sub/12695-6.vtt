WEBVTT

00:08.742 --> 00:10.644
* Thinkin' I was born
in the wrong time *

00:10.744 --> 00:11.579
* One of a kind

00:11.679 --> 00:14.282
* Livin' in a world
gone plastic *

00:14.382 --> 00:16.350
* Baby you're so classic

00:16.450 --> 00:20.454
- [clicks off music]
Baby, you're so loud.

00:20.554 --> 00:22.956
- Sorry, just
feeding breakfast

00:23.057 --> 00:24.992
to Malcolm and Tony
from MKTO.

00:25.093 --> 00:28.962
- Phoebe, you've lost
your mind.

00:29.063 --> 00:30.998
- No, the MKTO concert
is completely sold out,

00:31.099 --> 00:32.866
but I can still
get two tickets

00:32.966 --> 00:35.436
if I win "The Most
Outrageous Fan" contest.

00:35.536 --> 00:39.407
I call this "Waking up
with MKTO."

00:39.507 --> 00:42.976
- I call it waking up people
who don't want to be awake.

00:43.077 --> 00:46.280
- Hey, hey, hey.
It's never too early for bacon.

00:46.380 --> 00:49.450
Thank you.
- PHOEBE: [powers zap]

00:49.550 --> 00:52.453
That's for Tony.
He loves apple-smoked bacon.

00:52.553 --> 00:53.954
But he hates pineapple.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.556
He's deathly
allergic to it.

00:55.656 --> 00:59.660
- Well, you'd better hope
he's not allergic to crazy.

00:59.760 --> 01:01.129
- Achoo!

01:01.229 --> 01:04.132
Oh, no, I'm allergic
to crazy.

01:04.165 --> 01:06.367
Phoebe, you have
to move out.

01:06.467 --> 01:08.136
- I am not crazy, okay?

01:08.202 --> 01:09.637
This contest is huge.

01:09.737 --> 01:11.004
People are sending poems,
weaving quilts.

01:11.139 --> 01:15.376
One gutsy girl even tried
to make a butter sculpture.

01:20.281 --> 01:22.383
I ran out of butter, okay?

01:22.483 --> 01:24.285
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a contest to win.

01:24.385 --> 01:25.853
Boys, who wants pancakes?

01:25.953 --> 01:28.256
[clicks on music]
* You're over my head

01:28.356 --> 01:30.258
* I'm out of my mind

01:30.358 --> 01:32.193
* Thinkin' I was born...

01:32.293 --> 01:34.027
- Shouldn't we be
worried about that?

01:34.162 --> 01:36.830
- What? It's teenage girl
going gaga over a band.

01:36.930 --> 01:37.931
Totally normal.

01:38.031 --> 01:39.267
- Not her, him.

01:39.367 --> 01:45.506
- So, where you come from is
everyone made out of cardboard?

01:46.174 --> 01:49.177
- *

01:49.243 --> 01:50.611
* What you see

01:50.711 --> 01:51.912
* Is not what you get

01:52.012 --> 01:55.183
* Livin' our lives
with a secret *

01:55.283 --> 01:56.984
* We fit right in

01:57.084 --> 01:58.486
* Bet you never guessed

01:58.586 --> 01:59.987
* 'Cause we're
livin' our lives *

02:00.188 --> 02:01.822
* Just like all the rest

02:01.922 --> 02:03.391
* A picture
perfect family *

02:03.491 --> 02:05.526
* Is what we try to be

02:05.626 --> 02:06.360
* Look closer,
you might see *

02:06.460 --> 02:08.529
* The crazy things we do

02:08.629 --> 02:10.198
* This isn't
make believe *

02:10.264 --> 02:11.199
* It's our reality

02:11.265 --> 02:13.467
* Just your average family

02:13.567 --> 02:16.437
* Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble *

02:16.537 --> 02:20.208
* Livin' a double life

02:22.976 --> 02:27.848
- *

02:28.716 --> 02:30.318
- Oyster, do you
have any idea

02:30.418 --> 02:31.952
how to order fries
on this thing?

02:32.052 --> 02:34.222
- Hey, first time
at Splatburger?

02:34.288 --> 02:35.289
You get Splat hats.

02:35.389 --> 02:37.891
- Uh, oh, dude, no hats.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.761
We're kind of known
for our hair.

02:40.861 --> 02:43.597
- Oh, what's that like?

02:43.697 --> 02:45.266
Anyway, here's the deal--
all the food's pre-cooked,

02:45.366 --> 02:47.268
so you've just gotta
punch your order in like this,

02:47.368 --> 02:50.238
and it shoots out of these
tubes onto your plates.

02:50.304 --> 02:53.641
Splat away!
[laughing]

02:53.741 --> 02:57.245
- Sweet!
- Cool!

02:57.311 --> 03:01.148
- Yeah, food from tubes.

03:01.249 --> 03:02.383
The future's here, boys.

03:02.483 --> 03:04.885
Uh, I'm legally bound
to tell you

03:04.985 --> 03:06.420
there's no way to actually
clean these babies.

03:06.520 --> 03:09.022
[knocks on table]
Good luck.

03:09.122 --> 03:14.262
- [food shoots, thuds]
- Ah, bonus pickle.

03:14.362 --> 03:15.829
- Whoa, check it out.

03:15.929 --> 03:18.366
It's that girl from school
you think likes you.

03:18.466 --> 03:21.769
- Her name's Cassandra
and she does like me, all right?

03:21.869 --> 03:24.305
We play ignore-flirt
all the time.

03:27.275 --> 03:29.777
Oh, she's good.

03:29.877 --> 03:32.280
- I wish I could go out
with you, Craig, but I can't.

03:32.380 --> 03:34.548
I'm going to the MKTO
concert on Friday.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.350
- She shut him down.

03:36.450 --> 03:39.086
But at least
she spoke to him.

03:39.186 --> 03:41.855
- Hey, clam it, Oyster.
I've got an idea.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.824
- Hey, uh, Max, right?

03:43.924 --> 03:47.828
I didn't see you there.
- Yeah, you didn't.

03:47.928 --> 03:51.098
So, I was lookin' at
the Polynesian pot stickers.

03:51.198 --> 03:54.768
I love apple-smoked bacon,
but I can't have pineapple.

03:54.868 --> 03:57.538
See, I'm deathly
allergic to that.

03:57.638 --> 03:58.406
- Oh! That's just
like Tony from...

03:58.506 --> 04:01.208
- CASSANDRA & MAX:
MKTO!

04:01.309 --> 04:03.877
- What, you like them, too?
- I'm literally obsessed.

04:03.977 --> 04:07.781
What's your favorite song?
- Uh...all of them!

04:07.881 --> 04:10.318
- But if you had to pick one,
what would it be?

04:10.418 --> 04:11.885
- [loud thud]
- Ow!

04:11.985 --> 04:12.753
- I can't just pick
one, either.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.555
Are you going to
the concert?

04:14.655 --> 04:15.789
- Yeah, of course,
I'm going.

04:15.889 --> 04:17.758
Maybe we can meet up
and rock out.

04:17.858 --> 04:20.361
- Sounds like a date.
[laughs]

04:20.461 --> 04:21.462
- Epic play, man.

04:21.562 --> 04:23.597
But isn't that concert
sold out?

04:23.697 --> 04:24.898
- Oh, dude, way
ahead of you.

04:24.998 --> 04:27.100
Phoebe's entering this
MKTO contest

04:27.200 --> 04:29.737
and if I help her win, she'll
give me one of her tickets.

04:29.837 --> 04:30.938
- Nice!

04:31.038 --> 04:32.573
We should celebrate
with more fries.

04:32.673 --> 04:34.575
- Yes!
- Yo, tube dudes!

04:34.675 --> 04:35.709
More fries!

04:35.809 --> 04:38.245
- Oyster, that's not
how it works.

04:40.548 --> 04:44.084
Maybe it is.

04:44.184 --> 04:47.355
- Ah, the "Thunder Purge."
My favorite time of the year.

04:47.455 --> 04:53.427
I get to destroy all our old
junk and not get in trouble.

04:53.527 --> 04:55.262
[powers zapping]

04:55.363 --> 04:56.564
- [coughing]

04:56.664 --> 05:01.969
I'm no lung doctor, but I'm
pretty sure this is bad for me.

05:02.069 --> 05:06.974
- Guys, say hello
to our new...

05:07.074 --> 05:09.009
shredder.
- [thuds heavily]

05:09.109 --> 05:11.879
- It's gonna help us
clean this place up.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.981
- Are you sure this
thing can handle

05:14.081 --> 05:16.116
a year's worth
of Thunder trash?

05:16.216 --> 05:17.785
- It can shred anything.

05:17.885 --> 05:21.455
Check it out.
- [shredder whirring]

05:21.555 --> 05:23.524
- [machine shredding]

05:23.624 --> 05:25.092
- Ha! Ha!

05:25.192 --> 05:27.428
- Whoa, it's
a super-shredder.

05:27.528 --> 05:31.064
- Yeah, and without
the ashy aftermath.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.533
- We don't need that thing.
Watch this!

05:32.633 --> 05:35.703
[powers zapping]
- Ow!

05:35.803 --> 05:37.405
There go the instructions.

05:37.438 --> 05:40.541
- Come on, Billy.
Let's play Hide and Seek.

05:40.641 --> 05:44.678
- Um...maybe later.

05:44.778 --> 05:45.646
Welcome to the family.

05:45.746 --> 05:49.683
I'm gonna call you Shreddy.

05:49.783 --> 05:52.820
- [powers zapping]
- Ow.

05:52.920 --> 05:56.056
That's Nora.
I'll tell you about her later.

05:59.460 --> 06:04.231
- Phoebe, are you taking
the cut-outs for a walk?

06:04.331 --> 06:06.033
- That's ridiculous.

06:06.133 --> 06:08.669
Who takes cardboard
cut-outs for a walk?

06:08.769 --> 06:11.104
I'm using them as kites.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.474
- Lame alert!
- It is not lame.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.175
I'm gonna take
a picture of them

06:15.275 --> 06:17.144
up in the air for
the MKTO contest,

06:17.244 --> 06:20.581
and then they'll know my love
for them is sky high.

06:20.681 --> 06:22.450
Get it?
- I get it.

06:22.483 --> 06:23.751
Yeah, it's lame.

06:23.851 --> 06:26.854
- Well, Phoebe,
lucky for you

06:26.954 --> 06:28.188
I've got a winning idea

06:28.288 --> 06:30.891
that'll only cost you
one of your tickets.

06:30.991 --> 06:33.694
- You wanna go to
the MKTO concert?

06:33.794 --> 06:35.228
What's her name?

06:35.328 --> 06:36.597
- It's Cassandra
from school.

06:36.697 --> 06:38.466
She's going.
I told her I'd meet her there.

06:38.499 --> 06:39.700
- Aw, Cassandra's so sweet.
- Yeah.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.702
- Why would I ruin her life
by helping you date her?

06:41.802 --> 06:44.171
- Okay.

06:44.271 --> 06:45.639
- Besides, my cut-out idea's
already gonna win.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.508
Right, guys?

06:47.608 --> 06:50.177
- Hey, look,
a dry-cleaning bill...

06:50.277 --> 06:51.479
- Oh, my.
- ...from three years ago?

06:51.545 --> 06:54.615
- They itemized it.
- Oh.

06:54.715 --> 06:56.850
- All right, fine.
What's your big idea?

06:56.950 --> 06:58.519
Throw me out of a plane?

06:58.619 --> 07:00.921
And I know Malcolm loves
classic cars

07:01.021 --> 07:02.355
and Siberian huskies,

07:02.490 --> 07:05.058
and Tony named his hamster
Princess Leia.

07:05.158 --> 07:07.861
I know everything about
you, MKTO!

07:07.961 --> 07:10.498
But not so much
that it's weird.

07:10.598 --> 07:13.734
I'm your most outrageous fan
and I'm falling for yooooouuuu!

07:15.936 --> 07:17.771
- Cut!
- Okay, now let me down.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.807
- You got it.
- Whoa!

07:19.907 --> 07:22.510
- [heavy thud]
- [laughing]

07:22.576 --> 07:27.380
Now do it again--just higher
and closer to the rocks.

07:27.515 --> 07:28.816
- All we have to do now

07:28.916 --> 07:31.284
is upload the video
to the contest websites.

07:31.384 --> 07:33.120
- Do you think we'll win?
- I know we'll win.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.522
Between your freakish
fan knowledge

07:34.622 --> 07:36.657
and my video skills,
it's a slam-dunk.

07:36.757 --> 07:39.359
- Thank you so much
for everything.

07:39.527 --> 07:41.161
Except for dropping
me on my face.

07:41.261 --> 07:42.863
- True.

07:42.963 --> 07:47.100
- So, you rigging
the contest?

07:47.200 --> 07:49.537
- Do monkeys have
monkey butts?

07:49.603 --> 07:51.204
I'm gonna put a hidden
message in the video

07:51.304 --> 07:53.306
that says "Pick me"
every four seconds.

07:53.406 --> 07:54.542
- Great idea!

07:54.575 --> 07:59.179
But for the record,
it's monkey heinies.

07:59.279 --> 08:01.381
Look it up.

08:05.553 --> 08:07.087
- Guys, why invite me,

08:07.187 --> 08:08.556
if you're gonna stare
at Cassandra

08:08.589 --> 08:09.790
and you're gonna stare
at your phone

08:09.890 --> 08:12.826
to find out if you
won that contest?

08:12.926 --> 08:13.927
- We didn't invite you.

08:14.027 --> 08:14.828
You were already here.

08:14.928 --> 08:17.665
- Oh.

08:17.765 --> 08:19.967
Then carry on.

08:20.067 --> 08:22.936
- MKTO!
Oh, my gosh, we won!

08:23.036 --> 08:23.971
We actually won!

08:24.071 --> 08:25.839
Max, we did it!
- Yes, up top!

08:25.939 --> 08:28.308
- Thank you so much.

08:28.408 --> 08:30.277
I take back everything bad
I've ever said about you.

08:30.377 --> 08:34.214
- Of course, I would
do anything for my sister.

08:34.314 --> 08:37.818
Now get lost.
Cassandra's coming!

08:37.918 --> 08:39.587
Hey, Cassandra.

08:39.653 --> 08:41.589
You getting excited
for our concert date?

08:41.689 --> 08:43.891
- Bad news, Max.
My ticket fell through.

08:43.991 --> 08:45.425
I can't go.

08:45.593 --> 08:47.795
- Well, uh, maybe we can
do something else.

08:47.895 --> 08:48.962
- And have you miss out
on the concert?

08:49.062 --> 08:51.031
You love MKTO.

08:51.131 --> 08:51.999
- I also love waterslides.

08:52.099 --> 08:54.968
Let's find one
and go there.

08:55.068 --> 08:57.337
- I can't do
that to you.

08:57.437 --> 08:59.406
You just...

08:59.506 --> 09:01.008
have to go for
the both of us.

09:04.411 --> 09:06.647
- [Shreddy whirring]
- Oh, ho, ho!

09:06.747 --> 09:10.350
Oh! Ha! Ha!
This thing's unstoppable.

09:10.450 --> 09:11.952
I thought a shredder
would be fun,

09:12.052 --> 09:16.223
but it...it really
completes the family.

09:16.323 --> 09:17.524
- It's purge day, Shreddy,

09:17.625 --> 09:19.126
and you're at the top
of my list.

09:19.226 --> 09:22.162
[powers zapping]

09:22.262 --> 09:24.131
- [Shreddy powers down]
- Oh, no!

09:24.231 --> 09:26.834
What happened?

09:26.934 --> 09:28.702
- Looks like it's got
a faulty wire.

09:28.802 --> 09:29.970
You know who doesn't
need a wire?

09:30.070 --> 09:32.640
- [Shreddy powers up]

09:32.740 --> 09:35.108
- Shreddy, you have
a back-up battery!

09:35.208 --> 09:42.315
- This is shredding
my mind!

09:42.415 --> 09:42.983
- Do you really think
I'm gonna give you

09:43.083 --> 09:45.552
both MKTO tickets?

09:45.653 --> 09:47.755
- Do monkeys have
monkey butts?

09:47.855 --> 09:49.189
- Heinies.

09:49.289 --> 09:51.892
- Whatever they sit on.

09:51.992 --> 09:53.260
The answer is no.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.562
Mom, did the concert
tickets get here?

09:55.663 --> 09:57.097
- Yeah, I left them
with the mail.

09:57.197 --> 09:58.565
- Where's the mail?
- On top of the magazines.

09:58.666 --> 10:02.502
- Where's the magazines?
- In Shreddy's belly.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.838
- You shredded
my tickets?

10:04.938 --> 10:06.073
- I'm not sure.

10:06.173 --> 10:09.376
I shredded the list
of things I shredded.

10:09.476 --> 10:11.278
- Don't worry,
the tickets must be

10:11.378 --> 10:15.448
in one of the 50 trash
bags out back.

10:15.548 --> 10:18.118
- Not so popular now,
are you, Shreddy.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.853
- [Shreddy whirring]
- Ah!

10:19.953 --> 10:22.055
- I need to find
those tickets.

10:22.155 --> 10:23.090
How will Malcom and/or Tony

10:23.190 --> 10:25.759
fall in love with me,
if they never see me?

10:25.859 --> 10:27.227
- You'll find
the tickets, sweetie.

10:27.327 --> 10:29.730
We'll help you.
Come on.

10:31.298 --> 10:35.969
- Hey, the concert tickets.

10:36.069 --> 10:37.104
Uh, Phoebe?

10:37.204 --> 10:38.605
- Hey, what are you doing?

10:38.706 --> 10:40.440
She wouldn't have won,
if it wasn't for you.

10:40.540 --> 10:42.175
You should use
those tickets

10:42.275 --> 10:44.277
to take that Cassandra girl
you think likes you.

10:44.377 --> 10:46.179
- She does like me!

10:46.279 --> 10:48.315
- Max, why'd you call me?

10:48.415 --> 10:50.083
Did you find the tickets?
- No!

10:50.183 --> 10:52.152
I was just practicing
how I'd yell your name,

10:52.252 --> 10:55.088
if I found the tickets--
which I definitely did not.

11:02.529 --> 11:05.833
but somehow I made
these paper mittens.

11:05.933 --> 11:07.067
- Don't worry, sweetie.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.136
We have two more hours
before the concert.

11:09.236 --> 11:10.603
Everybody glue faster.

11:10.738 --> 11:12.105
- We do not know
how this happened.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.907
- Uh-uh.

11:14.007 --> 11:16.443
- Just forget it.
We're never gonna find them.

11:16.543 --> 11:19.446
At least I can still hang out
with my cardboard cuties.

11:19.546 --> 11:21.514
Anyone seen
Malcolm and Tony?

11:21.614 --> 11:23.650
- Well, here's Tony.

11:23.751 --> 11:26.920
You do not want
to see Malcolm.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.389
- That's it, my life
is officially over.

11:29.489 --> 11:33.160
- Aw, honey, I--Oh!

11:33.260 --> 11:34.594
And I'm stuck.

11:34.762 --> 11:36.463
A little help here, Hank?

11:36.563 --> 11:40.968
- I can't. I seem to have
joined the band!

11:41.068 --> 11:48.175
- *

11:48.275 --> 11:49.309
- So, here's your ticket.

11:49.409 --> 11:52.312
- Thanks.
This is so exciting.

11:52.412 --> 11:54.447
Concert selfie!

11:54.547 --> 11:57.317
Now let me get a picture
of my hero.

11:57.417 --> 11:59.086
- BOTH: [laughing]

11:59.186 --> 12:03.290
- [wings flapping]
- [poop splats]

12:03.390 --> 12:06.994
- CROWD: [laughing]

12:07.094 --> 12:09.396
- Please tell me
that it's rain...

12:09.496 --> 12:12.499
with a hint of green.

12:12.599 --> 12:13.801
- Hey, in some cultures,

12:13.834 --> 12:15.702
it's considered
to be good luck.

12:15.803 --> 12:18.105
- Yeah, in all cultures
it's disgusting.

12:18.205 --> 12:19.272
- [laughing]

12:19.372 --> 12:22.810
- Wait, you're not gonna
post that on Chirper, are you?

12:22.876 --> 12:24.311
- Oops, I kinda just did.
- Wha...?

12:24.411 --> 12:27.147
- But you looked so cute.

12:27.247 --> 12:30.250
- You hashtagged me
birdturd?

12:30.350 --> 12:31.484
- It's my first
nickname for you.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.054
It's adorb.

12:34.154 --> 12:35.722
- Why don't you work
on my second nickname

12:35.823 --> 12:36.623
while I go wash
this off.

12:36.723 --> 12:38.391
- Hurry back, BT.
[laughing]

12:38.491 --> 12:41.528
Hey, I just did it.

12:41.628 --> 12:43.296
- Keep workin' on it!

12:47.835 --> 12:49.269
- [sighs]
Stupid shoe.

12:49.369 --> 12:52.439
Can't even make it
three blocks.

12:52.539 --> 12:54.341
I'm so done with this day.

12:54.441 --> 12:55.675
- Welcome to Splatburger.

12:55.843 --> 12:57.510
Forgive me,
I'm a little flustered

12:57.610 --> 12:58.378
from this crazy
dinner rush.

12:58.478 --> 13:00.447
[laughs]

13:00.547 --> 13:02.916
- I'm the only one here.

13:03.016 --> 13:04.918
- Uh, for now.

13:05.018 --> 13:06.553
But when that MKTO
concert lets out,

13:06.653 --> 13:09.022
there's gonna be food
flyin' out of that tube,

13:09.122 --> 13:11.892
and that tube, and, oh...
[laughing]

13:11.992 --> 13:15.328
...that tube.
Splat! Splat! Splat! Splat!

13:15.428 --> 13:16.964
- [sighs]

13:25.906 --> 13:28.876
- Sweet!
This place is empty.

13:28.942 --> 13:30.577
Well, I guess
we don't need these.

13:30.677 --> 13:32.512
- [moustaches ripping]
- Ow!

13:32.612 --> 13:35.248
- Oh!

13:35.348 --> 13:36.416
- It's MKTO!

13:36.516 --> 13:37.684
- Woo, man, good thing
no one's here.

13:37.784 --> 13:39.352
I mean, I love
our fans, but...

13:39.452 --> 13:42.022
we seem to lose
a few every time

13:42.122 --> 13:43.891
they see you chew
your food, you know?

13:43.957 --> 13:45.792
- [laughing]
Okay, mom.

13:45.893 --> 13:47.660
Look, I'm just glad
we're gonna get

13:47.760 --> 13:49.762
a nice, quiet meal before
tonight's concert, you know?

13:49.897 --> 13:51.398
- Right, just a couple of
regular guys,

13:51.498 --> 13:52.933
not MKTO, you know?

13:53.033 --> 13:55.735
- It's MKTO!
I'm so chirping this.

13:55.903 --> 13:57.404
We're gonna be packed
in no time.

13:57.504 --> 14:00.908
- Wait, no.
You'll scare them away.

14:00.941 --> 14:04.444
- [powers gusting]
- [frost crackling]

14:04.544 --> 14:07.614
- Excuse me?
Can we get a table?

14:07.714 --> 14:08.748
- Ra--Ra--

14:08.916 --> 14:12.452
Right away.
[laughing]

14:15.956 --> 14:20.127
- Hey, are you...
Are you okay?

14:20.227 --> 14:22.495
- I'm feeling a little
weak in the knees.

14:22.595 --> 14:24.932
- Are you sure it's not
your busted shoes?

14:24.998 --> 14:26.499
- Come on, Malcolm,

14:26.599 --> 14:27.700
you don't insult
a pretty girl's shoes.

14:27.800 --> 14:30.503
- Right. Right.
- Pretty?

14:30.603 --> 14:32.039
[snorts]

14:32.139 --> 14:33.006
Have a seat.

14:33.106 --> 14:34.674
I'm gonna water
some grab you.

14:34.774 --> 14:37.377
I mean grab you
some water.

14:40.948 --> 14:42.215
- Thank you.

14:42.315 --> 14:44.484
- [excited squealing]

14:48.121 --> 14:51.558
- The Port-a-Potty
has no soap or water.

14:51.658 --> 14:53.961
What are we, animals?

14:54.061 --> 14:57.230
- Max! Hey!
- You went in?

14:57.330 --> 14:58.431
- I had to.
The line started moving.

14:58.531 --> 15:00.667
But then I met
a bunch of peeps

15:00.767 --> 15:03.070
who re-chirped your photo

15:03.170 --> 15:04.771
and now it's all
over the Internet.

15:04.871 --> 15:07.640
How excited are you?

15:07.740 --> 15:09.009
- Uh, zero, not very.

15:09.109 --> 15:10.978
- But you're famous.

15:11.011 --> 15:12.980
Everyone's calling
your birdturd.

15:13.046 --> 15:14.982
- That is the wrong
kind of famous.

15:15.048 --> 15:16.984
- Hurry, I'll see
you inside, turdsie.

15:17.017 --> 15:19.452
Oh, another nickname.
I'm on fire.

15:19.552 --> 15:20.887
[laughs]

15:25.792 --> 15:27.360
- Whoa! Sorry, slick.

15:27.460 --> 15:28.528
No cuttin' on my watch.

15:28.628 --> 15:30.563
Get to the back
of the line.

15:30.663 --> 15:32.232
- I'm not cutting.
I waited in line.

15:32.332 --> 15:33.866
I just stepped out
for a sec.

15:34.001 --> 15:35.835
- Oh, my bad.

15:36.003 --> 15:37.837
Well, in that case,
get to the back of the line!

15:38.005 --> 15:40.707
- Come on, man, my date's
inside waiting for me.

15:40.807 --> 15:42.242
I can see her from here.

15:42.342 --> 15:44.077
- Do you know where
you won't see her from?

15:44.177 --> 15:46.613
- BOTH: The back
of the line.

15:46.713 --> 15:49.649
- First a bird poops
on me, now this.

15:49.749 --> 15:50.817
- Hold up.

15:50.917 --> 15:53.020
Hey, you're birdturd.

15:53.086 --> 15:55.055
You gotta lead
with that, BT.

15:55.155 --> 15:56.556
Just show me your
ticket and you're in.

15:56.656 --> 15:59.826
- Yes, thank you,
Mr. Bouncer.

15:59.926 --> 16:03.330
Oh, no, I lost my ticket.

16:03.430 --> 16:05.898
- Oh, birdturd!

16:06.033 --> 16:08.535
It is not your day.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.737
- Maybe I left it
in the Port-a-Potty.

16:16.109 --> 16:18.278
- [pounding]

16:18.378 --> 16:20.647
- MAX: Whoa!

16:24.151 --> 16:26.519
Oh, definitely
no ticket.

16:28.555 --> 16:29.922
- All right, Shreddy,

16:30.057 --> 16:33.426
time to make school lunches
for the next month.

16:33.526 --> 16:39.466
- [Shreddy whirring]

16:39.566 --> 16:41.934
- Aw, turkey again?

16:42.069 --> 16:43.403
- Billy, what are
you doing?

16:43.503 --> 16:44.971
We were playing
Hide and Seek.

16:45.072 --> 16:48.408
I've been hiding in
Dad's laundry pile for an hour.

16:48.508 --> 16:51.311
- Sounds like someone needs some
fresh-sliced turkey.

16:51.411 --> 16:53.080
- I don't want your
petty poultry.

16:53.146 --> 16:55.348
I can't believe
you blew me off

16:55.448 --> 16:57.350
to hang with
this rust bucket.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.319
- Don't listen
to her, Shreddy.

16:59.419 --> 17:01.254
She's just jealous
of your lifetime warranty

17:01.354 --> 17:06.593
on parts and labor.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.761
- [Shreddy whirring]

17:08.861 --> 17:11.098
- Shreddy, no!

17:11.164 --> 17:13.100
I don't wanna
be lunch meat!

17:13.133 --> 17:16.103
Ah, Nora! Help!

17:16.136 --> 17:18.338
- [powers zapping]

17:18.438 --> 17:20.207
- [Shreddy powers down]

17:20.307 --> 17:22.375
- Oh, Billy,
are you okay?

17:22.475 --> 17:23.843
- Yeah, but I think
I need to go change.

17:23.943 --> 17:28.115
- Your hoodie?
- No, my pants.

17:28.215 --> 17:31.284
Nora, I'm sorry I spent
so much time with Shreddy.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.120
A shredder could never
replace you.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.554
- He's right.

17:34.654 --> 17:37.957
You are the only destructive
force we need in our lives.

17:38.125 --> 17:39.826
- Aw, thanks, guys.

17:39.926 --> 17:41.828
- [powers zapping]
- OTHERS: [yelping]

17:41.928 --> 17:44.131
- Don't ever try
to replace me again.

17:48.401 --> 17:51.804
- [menu beeping]
- Mmm!

17:51.904 --> 17:54.807
- BOTH: Whoa!

17:54.907 --> 17:56.676
- Where did this
just come from?

17:56.776 --> 17:59.446
- I don't know,
but I know where it's going.

17:59.546 --> 18:01.181
- And here is some
wasabi ranch sauce

18:01.281 --> 18:03.316
for your pigs
in a blanket.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.585
- Oh, on point.
That's my favorite.

18:05.685 --> 18:07.154
Wait, how did
you know that?

18:07.254 --> 18:08.688
- 'Cause I know everything

18:08.788 --> 18:12.192
about y--
ummy dipping sauces.

18:12.292 --> 18:15.495
Splat away.
[laughing]

18:15.595 --> 18:20.066
- Ooh, here come
my Polynesian pot stickers.

18:20.167 --> 18:21.234
- Tony can't eat
Polynesian pot stickers.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.670
He's allergic to pineapple.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.972
- Woo!
- Yeah!

18:26.072 --> 18:28.275
- Love it!

18:28.375 --> 18:33.680
- Hey, that shoe just took out
my Polynesian pot sticker.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.315
- I'm sorry, it's just that
you're allergic to pineapple

18:35.415 --> 18:38.251
and I didn't want you
to get sick.

18:38.351 --> 18:40.953
You're MKTO!

18:41.053 --> 18:44.824
- I think the shoe ninja's
a fan, bro.

18:44.924 --> 18:46.759
- Okay, it's true. I...

18:46.859 --> 18:48.761
I'm a super fan,
but I heard you guys say

18:48.861 --> 18:49.996
that you wanted to
have a quiet meal,

18:50.096 --> 18:53.400
and I ruined it
and I'm sorry.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.735
- Sorry for what?
You just saved my life.

18:55.835 --> 18:57.937
Look, how...how
can we repay you?

18:58.037 --> 19:00.106
- Marry me.

19:00.207 --> 19:01.541
Sorry.
[laughing]

19:01.641 --> 19:03.343
That was really weird.

19:03.443 --> 19:05.212
Let's just hang
out forever.

19:05.278 --> 19:07.914
- Hm, I think we have
a better idea.

19:08.014 --> 19:10.016
- Mm-hm.

19:10.116 --> 19:12.419
* We broke down
tryin' to leave town *

19:12.519 --> 19:17.224
* Flyin' on
the road to change *

19:17.290 --> 19:19.292
* We were born to run

19:19.392 --> 19:21.361
* Cali, here we come

19:21.461 --> 19:26.233
* Escape from
nowhere USA *

19:26.299 --> 19:28.235
- * Say goodbye to
white picket fences *

19:28.268 --> 19:30.237
* Say hello
to palm trees and Benzes *

19:30.337 --> 19:32.672
* They said you gotta fall
to have it all *

19:32.772 --> 19:34.341
- * Yeah

19:34.441 --> 19:36.676
- * No we don't want
two kids and a wife *

19:36.776 --> 19:38.545
* I don't want a job
I just want a life *

19:38.645 --> 19:40.280
* Sometimes
the underdogs rise *

19:40.380 --> 19:44.551
* And the mighty fall
- * And the mighty fall

19:44.651 --> 19:46.619
* This ain't the same
summer song *

19:46.719 --> 19:48.255
* That you used to know

19:48.321 --> 19:52.158
* 'Cause Jack left Diane
30 years ago *

19:52.259 --> 19:53.426
* The world is spinning
too fast *

19:53.526 --> 19:56.095
* For you and me

19:56.263 --> 19:57.129
* So tell me

19:57.264 --> 20:00.500
* Whatever happened
to the American Dream *

20:00.600 --> 20:03.503
* Na Na Na Na Na
Na Na Na Na Na *

20:03.603 --> 20:07.407
* Na Na Na Na Na Na

20:07.507 --> 20:11.344
* Na Na Na Na Na
Na Na Na Na Na *

20:11.444 --> 20:16.082
* Na Na Na Na Na Na

20:16.182 --> 20:17.417
- Not again.

20:17.517 --> 20:19.586
You win, birds.

20:19.686 --> 20:21.488
- [birds screeching]

20:21.588 --> 20:23.856
- Uh-oh!
I said you win! You win!

20:23.956 --> 20:25.558
- * This ain't the same
summer song *

20:25.658 --> 20:27.560
* That you used to know

20:27.660 --> 20:30.530
* 'Cause Jack left Diane
30 years ago *

20:30.630 --> 20:33.866
* The world is spinning
too fast *

20:33.966 --> 20:34.567
* For you and me

20:34.667 --> 20:36.303
* So tell me

20:36.403 --> 20:40.407
* Whatever happened
to the American Dream *

20:45.412 --> 20:47.447
- [sighs]

20:47.547 --> 20:49.582
Does this night
ever have to end?

20:49.682 --> 20:52.652
- Yeah, we kinda
have that concert thing.

20:52.752 --> 20:55.087
- [cell phone ringing]

20:55.187 --> 20:56.856
- And apparently there
is some crazy fan

20:56.956 --> 21:00.192
outside the venue
screaming at birds.

21:00.293 --> 21:01.828
- What?

21:01.928 --> 21:03.896
- Some fans just
don't know how to act.

21:03.996 --> 21:06.466
- Yeah. Are you putting
my used napkin in your pocket?

21:06.566 --> 21:08.335
- What? No.

21:14.106 --> 21:17.610
- Shreddy Thunderman, you are
no longer part of this family.

21:17.710 --> 21:19.245
It's time to go.

21:19.346 --> 21:20.380
- Hit it, Nora.

21:20.480 --> 21:24.851
- [powers zapping]

21:24.951 --> 21:27.354
- Okay, come on.

21:27.454 --> 21:29.356
Who wants to watch me
throw this at the moon?

21:29.456 --> 21:31.591
- OTHERS: Yay!

21:34.627 --> 21:38.064
- Yikes, what
happened to you?

21:38.164 --> 21:39.499
- It's a long story.

21:39.599 --> 21:41.868
- I hope it ends with you
taking a long shower.

21:45.605 --> 21:46.639
- There you are.

21:46.739 --> 21:47.840
- Phoebe, let me explain
everything.

21:47.940 --> 21:50.543
- I just had the best
night of my entire life.

21:50.643 --> 21:52.545
MKTO gave me
a private concert.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.447
- You had a what
with who now?

21:54.547 --> 21:56.082
- It was amazing.

21:56.182 --> 21:59.586
Here, let me show you
some of the photos.

21:59.686 --> 22:01.521
Oops, wrong one.

22:01.621 --> 22:05.224
Sorry, birdturd.
[laughing]

22:05.392 --> 22:06.659
- Okay.

22:10.997 --> 22:26.846
- *
