- Joe?
- Yes?

02:19.705 --> 02:20.707
It's Gloria.

02:22.241 --> 02:23.676
- Gloria...
- Gloria Bell.

02:24.342 --> 02:26.910
Oh. Hi, how are you?

02:26.912 --> 02:29.248
- Good, how are you?
- I'm good.

02:30.348 --> 02:31.148
How long has it been?

02:31.150 --> 02:33.750
Oh, gosh,
10 or 12 years at least.

02:33.752 --> 02:35.719
Since my divorce, probably.

02:35.721 --> 02:37.554
Right. Right.

02:37.556 --> 02:41.361
- Well... You look good.
- Thanks. So do you.

02:42.294 --> 02:43.760
Cheers.

03:17.395 --> 03:18.894
Oh.

03:22.401 --> 03:23.969
How did you get in here again?

03:27.872 --> 03:30.906
All right. Go home!

03:30.908 --> 03:32.309
Go home!

03:41.753 --> 03:43.455
I gave you everything!

03:44.289 --> 03:45.424
Everything!

03:47.393 --> 03:48.661
What for, huh?

03:49.794 --> 03:51.964
What for? What for?

03:56.602 --> 03:59.369
What are you looking at, huh?

03:59.371 --> 04:00.907
Are you going to tell me
what to do?

04:02.741 --> 04:04.941
You know nothing, Dad!

04:04.943 --> 04:06.612
You don't know shit, man!

04:07.680 --> 04:10.346
Nobody knows anything!

04:44.449 --> 04:46.618
She said the light was yellow?

04:47.853 --> 04:50.456
Oh, no, I doubt
that she's color blind.

04:51.357 --> 04:52.859
Was there injury involved?

04:54.360 --> 04:55.694
Well, how about
the other driver?

04:57.995 --> 04:59.462
Is it Robert Cox?

05:03.569 --> 05:05.901
Oh, no. That's fantastic!

05:05.903 --> 05:07.503
Well, that's the most
important thing,

05:07.505 --> 05:08.671
that everybody is safe,

05:08.673 --> 05:10.507
because it's just a car

05:10.509 --> 05:12.709
and that's what
we're here for.

05:12.711 --> 05:15.378
No, I'm sure that you paid
your premium on time.

05:15.380 --> 05:17.079
Uh, but I will check on that

05:17.081 --> 05:18.517
and I'll get
right back to you.

05:19.685 --> 05:21.517
Hi, Anne, honey.

05:21.519 --> 05:23.887
Um, I haven't heard from you
in a while,

05:23.889 --> 05:25.589
so I thought
I'd give you a call

05:25.591 --> 05:27.390
and see what's going on.

05:27.392 --> 05:28.392
Um...

05:28.394 --> 05:30.894
It's pretty busy here
at the office, but just,

05:30.896 --> 05:34.397
you know, call me anytime
if you feel like it. Okay?

05:34.399 --> 05:35.899
I love you.

05:35.901 --> 05:37.036
It's your mother.

05:37.870 --> 05:39.536
Hi, Peter.

05:39.538 --> 05:40.937
It's Mom.

05:40.939 --> 05:43.740
Just, um... Just calling to
see how Hugo is feeling

05:43.742 --> 05:47.010
and if you guys
need any help or anything.

05:47.012 --> 05:48.413
Um, that's it.

05:49.514 --> 05:51.414
I love you.

05:51.416 --> 05:52.582
It's your mother.

05:52.584 --> 05:54.050
Oh, you doing again?

05:55.420 --> 05:56.620
- Put it back on.
- I should put him down.

05:56.622 --> 05:58.021
Oh, I can do it.
I can put him down.

05:58.023 --> 06:00.589
No, no. I'll do it.
It's gonna be faster.

06:00.591 --> 06:02.091
- Oh. Go with Daddy.
- Come on, buddy.

06:02.093 --> 06:04.527
- Go to Daddy. Okay.
- Come on.

06:04.529 --> 06:06.096
- See you later, Nana.
- See you later.

06:06.098 --> 06:07.464
See you later.

06:07.466 --> 06:08.701
Okay...

06:10.903 --> 06:11.971
Oh, God.

06:21.112 --> 06:22.514
Have you heard from Rachel?

06:24.550 --> 06:28.218
She's in the desert,
that's all I know.

06:28.220 --> 06:30.490
She's finding herself
in the desert.

06:30.923 --> 06:32.488
- I see.
- Yeah.

06:35.494 --> 06:37.797
- He's fussy, isn't he?
- Yeah...

06:39.497 --> 06:41.664
Do you think he still has
that ear infection?

06:41.666 --> 06:44.736
Uh, I don't know.
I don't think so.

06:45.637 --> 06:46.969
Did you give him
an antibiotic?

06:46.971 --> 06:48.774
Yeah, we gave him antibiotics.

06:50.108 --> 06:51.207
I mean, it could be bad.

06:51.209 --> 06:53.944
He could be having a reaction
to the antibiotics.

06:53.946 --> 06:55.512
I mean, you know...

06:55.514 --> 06:57.813
...sometimes it gives him
a stomachache or, um,

06:57.815 --> 07:00.115
a lot of diaper rash,

07:00.117 --> 07:02.618
or even a, um...
Even a fungus.

07:02.620 --> 07:04.086
There's this white stuff.

07:04.088 --> 07:06.255
It's called "thrush,"
in their mouth.

07:06.257 --> 07:07.690
Um...

07:07.692 --> 07:10.560
Did you...
Did you check in his mouth?

07:11.663 --> 07:12.829
- Did you? Did you?
- No.

07:12.831 --> 07:14.531
- Did you open his...
- I don't think...

07:14.533 --> 07:16.132
Sorry.

07:16.134 --> 07:17.968
Hey, Rachel.

07:17.970 --> 07:19.969
Yeah. It's so awesome
of you to call.

07:19.971 --> 07:21.540
It's really great, thank you.

07:23.141 --> 07:24.710
It's so nice of you
to check on us.

07:26.512 --> 07:29.111
Yeah, he's eating and... Yeah.

07:29.113 --> 07:32.017
His poops have been
very dark and solid.

07:33.651 --> 07:36.051
Where are you?

07:36.053 --> 07:38.857
No, he's not asking about
his mother, he doesn't speak!

07:40.526 --> 07:43.528
Uttanasana.
Facing forward,

07:44.596 --> 07:45.831
concave back.

07:47.031 --> 07:48.899
Extending over the legs,

07:48.901 --> 07:50.870
taking hands
in line with the feet.

07:53.004 --> 07:54.841
Press the palms together...

07:57.642 --> 07:58.844
And look up.

08:01.747 --> 08:04.548
Take your elbows
close to your body.

08:04.550 --> 08:06.985
Raise your knees,
raise your thighs.

08:11.088 --> 08:12.557
Well done.

08:13.225 --> 08:14.894
Good job, Gloria.

08:15.826 --> 08:17.562
Thank you, everybody.

08:18.663 --> 08:19.728
Bye.

08:19.730 --> 08:21.932
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

08:21.934 --> 08:23.733
- You did really well.
- You think so?

08:23.735 --> 08:24.901
Yeah, you should
come around...

08:24.903 --> 08:26.603
- I would love that.
- Bye. Thanks.

08:26.605 --> 08:27.836
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

08:27.838 --> 08:28.904
Excuse me.

08:28.906 --> 08:30.606
Everybody really loved
the class.

08:30.608 --> 08:32.043
- Oh, yeah?
- I can tell, yes.

08:33.177 --> 08:34.547
All right.

08:36.715 --> 08:38.914
- Shall we go?
- Yeah, let's go.

08:38.917 --> 08:41.086
Uh, Theo! Come here.

08:42.587 --> 08:44.285
Theo, this is my mom.

08:44.288 --> 08:45.921
- Hi!
- Mom, this is Theo.

08:45.923 --> 08:47.357
It's nice to meet you.

08:47.359 --> 08:48.892
Anne has told me
a lot about you.

08:48.894 --> 08:50.759
It's really nice to meet you.

08:50.761 --> 08:52.228
It's nice to meet you too.

08:52.230 --> 08:53.796
- Where are you from?
- Sweden.

08:53.798 --> 08:55.765
- Yeah?
- He's a big wave surfer.

08:55.767 --> 08:58.667
Yeah. I go around the world
looking for giant waves.

08:58.669 --> 09:01.137
- Oh!
- And I'm on my way to Oahu.

09:01.139 --> 09:03.373
So I stopped here
to surf the wedge

09:03.375 --> 09:05.742
in Newport and see Anne,
of course.

09:05.744 --> 09:08.978
- Oh. Of course.
- And she's...

09:08.980 --> 09:12.281
She's a spectacular woman
and very nice.

09:12.283 --> 09:13.382
Oh, well, yes.

09:13.384 --> 09:14.783
Oh, we've gotta go.

09:14.785 --> 09:16.118
- Do you practice a lot?
- Um, no.

09:16.120 --> 09:17.621
Actually,
this is my first time.

09:17.623 --> 09:19.823
Um, what about you?
Do you practice yoga often?

09:19.825 --> 09:21.757
I tried to, since I was 15.

09:21.759 --> 09:23.225
Oh, my goodness, that's, um...

09:23.227 --> 09:24.261
That's early to start,
isn't it?

09:24.263 --> 09:26.296
Okay, Mom, we're leaving.

09:26.298 --> 09:28.330
Oh, okay. Have fun.

09:28.332 --> 09:29.632
- Take care.
- Yeah.

09:29.634 --> 09:30.934
- Bye.
- Oh!

09:30.936 --> 09:33.639
- Nice to meet you.
- Very nice to meet you.

09:34.773 --> 09:36.609
- All good?
- Bye.

09:38.909 --> 09:41.346
- Bye. Call me, okay?
- Yes.

10:08.273 --> 10:09.805
Anyone coming?

10:09.807 --> 10:11.373
- I said I quit.
- Yeah, me too.

10:11.375 --> 10:12.677
But...

10:13.845 --> 10:16.182
I saw that huge drop
in my 401K.

10:17.783 --> 10:20.949
And I asked the human
resources guy and he said,

10:20.951 --> 10:23.987
"Oh, um, this is just due
to the market. It's normal."

10:23.989 --> 10:26.792
I can't even begin to
understand the stock market.

10:28.225 --> 10:31.393
The amount of money that
I'm gonna get is bullshit!

10:31.395 --> 10:33.463
Yeah, believe me,
I get it. I get it.

10:33.465 --> 10:36.699
And I'm only getting this
bullshit amount of money

10:36.701 --> 10:39.804
if I make it to
full retirement in five years.

10:43.375 --> 10:44.840
I'm gonna be working
in my 80s.

10:44.842 --> 10:46.309
I know.
If it all goes to hell,

10:46.311 --> 10:47.713
we can be roommates, okay?

10:49.147 --> 10:51.848
- Gloria, I'm fucked.
- Now, hey, you know what?

10:51.850 --> 10:53.849
If they fuck with you,
they fuck with me.

10:53.851 --> 10:55.884
We're in this together. Right?

10:55.886 --> 10:58.821
Hey! Hey, you fuckers!

10:58.823 --> 11:00.790
This woman is awesome!

11:00.792 --> 11:01.891
Treat her right!

11:01.893 --> 11:02.825
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

11:02.827 --> 11:04.927
She's a good woman,
she's a good friend.

11:04.929 --> 11:06.228
Respect her.

11:06.230 --> 11:08.897
She works her ass off,
you fuckers!

Is this seat taken?

11:46.037 --> 11:48.304
No, no. Have a seat.

11:48.306 --> 11:50.105
- Gloria.
- Stanley.

11:50.107 --> 11:52.142
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

11:52.144 --> 11:53.910
- Hi.
- Hi. Michelle.

11:53.912 --> 11:55.247
Very nice to meet you.

11:56.914 --> 11:59.549
Pat. Pat Banowsky.

11:59.551 --> 12:00.983
Pat Banowsky.

12:39.990 --> 12:42.492
- You're good at that.
- Thanks.

12:45.964 --> 12:48.097
Can I ask you a question?
I hope you don't mind.

12:48.099 --> 12:49.835
No, I don't mind.

12:50.601 --> 12:52.602
Have you had work done?

12:52.604 --> 12:54.337
No.

12:54.339 --> 12:57.272
- Really? Really?
- Thanks though.

12:58.342 --> 13:00.542
Pardon me. Shall we?

13:00.544 --> 13:02.512
- See you around.
- Mmm-hmm.

13:35.513 --> 13:36.916
Are you always
this happy?

13:40.485 --> 13:42.017
Uh, no.

13:42.019 --> 13:45.387
Oh. Uh, you asked me
and I laugh, that's all.

13:45.389 --> 13:46.524
Yeah.

13:49.027 --> 13:50.095
No.

13:53.932 --> 13:55.334
Some days I'm happy.

13:57.668 --> 13:58.903
Some days I'm not.

14:01.940 --> 14:03.573
Like everyone.

14:03.575 --> 14:05.344
- Like everyone.
- Mmm-hmm.

14:08.913 --> 14:10.348
Do you come here a lot?

14:10.948 --> 14:12.949
Yes.

14:12.951 --> 14:15.017
Uh... Yes, I'm...

14:15.019 --> 14:18.990
No, not a lot.
I mean, um, sometimes.

14:20.057 --> 14:21.559
When I feel like it.

14:23.427 --> 14:24.897
When I can.

14:31.001 --> 14:34.203
I like coming here though.
I like to dance.

14:34.205 --> 14:35.206
By yourself.

14:36.073 --> 14:36.942
By myself.

14:40.544 --> 14:42.111
I'm divorced.

14:42.113 --> 14:43.215
So am I.

14:44.249 --> 14:45.417
Oh, really?

14:47.284 --> 14:48.319
How long?

14:50.120 --> 14:51.389
One year.

14:52.590 --> 14:53.956
Recently.

14:53.958 --> 14:55.425
- Finally.
- Well, yes.

14:55.427 --> 14:57.660
Sometimes it's finally,
isn't it?

15:00.597 --> 15:04.903
I'm trying to change things.

15:06.004 --> 15:06.906
Life.

15:10.008 --> 15:11.076
What's your name?

15:14.645 --> 15:16.145
Gloria.

16:23.581 --> 16:24.750
What's this?

16:27.052 --> 16:28.253
Just take it off.

17:05.222 --> 17:07.192
Yeah, um, it's, uh...

17:08.593 --> 17:11.460
It's... It's 500.

17:11.462 --> 17:13.462
No, I know...
No, I know. I know.

17:13.464 --> 17:16.265
It's a lot, but you are
covered for a rental

17:16.267 --> 17:18.200
the entire time
your car is in the shop.

17:21.239 --> 17:23.538
Well, I can... I can arrange

17:23.540 --> 17:25.641
for you to get into
a rental vehicle. I'll just...

17:25.643 --> 17:27.242
I'll give them
all the information

17:27.243 --> 17:29.745
and I'll tell you where...

17:29.747 --> 17:31.316
...you can pick it up.

17:31.816 --> 17:33.248
Um...

17:33.250 --> 17:34.717
Or better yet,

17:34.719 --> 17:39.455
I'm gonna have them
deliver it to you, okay?

17:39.457 --> 17:41.556
No, it's... No...

17:41.558 --> 17:44.192
It's no trouble at all,
I can handle it.

17:44.194 --> 17:47.131
Believe me, anything you need,
I'm here for you, okay?

17:47.898 --> 17:49.832
I love cats.

17:49.834 --> 17:51.901
- How does it get in?
- I have no idea.

17:51.903 --> 17:54.569
I shut everything up and that
little fucker still gets in.

17:54.571 --> 17:57.172
Mm. Maybe it's trying
to tell you something.

17:57.174 --> 17:58.641
It's like a...
It's like a dead thing.

17:58.643 --> 18:01.244
It's like
an Egyptian mummy cat.

18:01.246 --> 18:02.411
Oh, like a sphinx?

18:02.413 --> 18:04.846
It doesn't have any hair,
Veronica.

18:04.848 --> 18:08.151
There's a beautiful story
about cats in the Bible.

18:08.153 --> 18:10.452
Oh, no, please... Ow! Ow!

18:10.454 --> 18:12.188
- Do you want more than that?
- Excuse me?

18:12.190 --> 18:13.689
Do you want
more off the sides?

18:13.691 --> 18:17.129
Uh, no. I think I just want
it regular, I don't want...

18:19.463 --> 18:22.597
A little bit more than that
actually, thanks.

18:22.599 --> 18:26.334
So, uh,
when the big flood came,

18:26.336 --> 18:28.171
God told Noah
to build a huge ark.

18:28.173 --> 18:29.604
And he brought his family.

18:29.606 --> 18:32.240
And two kinds of animals
from every species

18:32.242 --> 18:33.808
that existed in the world
back then.

18:33.810 --> 18:36.312
- Mmm-hmm.
- And soon there where just

18:36.314 --> 18:39.949
a ton of mice and they were
eating all the food.

18:39.951 --> 18:41.484
And Noah didn't know
what to do.

18:41.486 --> 18:43.885
So he asked God and God said,

18:43.887 --> 18:48.824
"Go find the lion,
pet its head like this."

18:48.826 --> 18:50.726
Three times.
And the lion went...

18:50.728 --> 18:55.664
Just letting out a gush of air

18:55.666 --> 18:57.568
and two cats
came out of its nose.

18:58.569 --> 19:00.873
Those cats
got rid of the mice.

19:01.638 --> 19:04.574
And so, order and balance

19:04.576 --> 19:06.310
were re-established
in the world.

19:07.211 --> 19:08.710
Ow! Ow.

19:08.712 --> 19:09.946
Sorry, sweetie.

19:09.948 --> 19:13.349
And we're gonna
hit our ribs softly like this.

19:13.351 --> 19:15.985
And we're gonna count
one, two, three!

19:20.224 --> 19:22.290
Again!

19:37.741 --> 19:39.342
Your father,

19:39.344 --> 19:43.246
God bless him,
left me just enough.

19:43.248 --> 19:45.448
And, no...

19:45.450 --> 19:49.852
No, I don't... I don't spend
much other than...

19:49.854 --> 19:52.321
Well, okay.
I do like to come here

19:52.323 --> 19:53.889
with my girlfriends
and have my salad,

19:53.891 --> 19:55.894
- but other than that...
- No. I know, yeah.

19:58.363 --> 20:01.564
It's just that
I could live too long.

20:01.566 --> 20:03.766
I just don't think
there's gonna be

20:03.768 --> 20:05.433
much left once I'm gone.

20:05.435 --> 20:07.370
I don't need anything.

20:07.372 --> 20:09.641
I've been paying my own bills
for a long time now.

20:11.409 --> 20:13.409
You won't even know it.

20:13.411 --> 20:14.876
You're gonna wake up
one morning

20:14.878 --> 20:15.944
and you'll find yourself

20:15.946 --> 20:17.613
a wrinkled old lady
just like me.

20:17.615 --> 20:20.349
You're not old.
You look beautiful.

20:20.351 --> 20:22.317
You do. You really do.

20:22.319 --> 20:26.421
Because life just goes by
in a flash.

20:26.423 --> 20:27.757
Like that.

20:27.759 --> 20:31.294
I know. You tell me
the same thing every 10 years.

20:31.296 --> 20:35.000
- Do you see what I mean?
- I know, Mom.

20:36.667 --> 20:38.769
- You'll be fine.
- Of course I will.

20:39.804 --> 20:41.836
At least you quit smoking,
thank God.

20:41.838 --> 20:43.372
Ladies.

20:43.374 --> 20:46.745
I'll just... I'll take that,
thank you very much.

20:49.346 --> 20:52.914
Gloria Bell.
Your tenant in apartment 2.

20:52.916 --> 20:54.482
You know I live below

20:54.484 --> 20:57.319
your son, Mrs. Duffy.

20:57.321 --> 21:00.655
Yes. That's... That's
actually why I'm calling

21:00.657 --> 21:05.827
and I'm so sorry to bother you
so late at night, um...

21:05.829 --> 21:07.930
- But, you know, I...
- Come here!

21:07.932 --> 21:10.533
I work and I have to get up

21:10.535 --> 21:12.834
early in the morning,
you know, so...

21:12.836 --> 21:14.603
Why be born?

21:14.605 --> 21:16.338
Yes, yes, exactly,

21:16.340 --> 21:19.710
and I hate to be the one to
tell you this, but are you...

21:20.877 --> 21:22.812
Are you aware
of what's happening?

21:22.814 --> 21:24.779
I just... Your son is...

21:24.781 --> 21:27.615
I think your son is having
some kind of a...

21:27.617 --> 21:29.485
- Some kind of a breakdown.
- <i>Is he there</i>

21:29.487 --> 21:30.652
- <i>with you?</i>
- No.

21:30.654 --> 21:32.654
It's all fucked up!
Don't go outside!

21:32.656 --> 21:35.123
I... It breaks my heart,

21:35.125 --> 21:39.894
I mean, honestly... I mean,
I'm a mom too, so I...

21:39.896 --> 21:42.832
I wanna die! I wanna die!

21:42.834 --> 21:44.999
He needs help.

21:45.001 --> 21:47.569
I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

21:47.571 --> 21:52.507
I'm sorry, I hate to do this,
but please, please listen.

21:52.509 --> 21:55.143
Listen.

21:55.145 --> 21:57.380
Don't be born, man!

21:57.382 --> 21:59.547
Don't be born!

21:59.549 --> 22:01.717
Don't be born!

22:14.030 --> 22:15.032
Hello?

22:17.034 --> 22:19.034
Uh, no, this is she.

22:27.711 --> 22:30.449
No, I'm not mad.
Why would I be mad?

22:38.455 --> 22:39.890
Are you asking me out?

22:47.798 --> 22:48.799
Thank you.

22:50.101 --> 22:51.603
You're such a gentleman.

22:53.438 --> 22:54.636
I can't get you
out of my head.

22:54.638 --> 22:56.505
I...

22:56.507 --> 22:58.908
I'm really... I'm constantly
thinking about you.

22:58.910 --> 23:00.112
You're just so...

23:02.712 --> 23:03.781
Different.

23:06.150 --> 23:07.886
What happened to me
with you, I...

23:09.921 --> 23:12.990
I thought it was never
gonna happen again.

23:14.491 --> 23:16.627
My head is still spinning.

23:17.828 --> 23:19.894
I didn't dare...

23:19.896 --> 23:23.065
It was driving me crazy.
I mean I wanted to,

23:23.067 --> 23:28.003
but I was too nervous
to call you.

23:28.005 --> 23:29.904
But I went for it, thank God.

23:29.906 --> 23:32.076
So, thank you.

23:33.810 --> 23:35.480
Thank you for coming.

23:36.079 --> 23:37.448
You're very welcome.

23:40.651 --> 23:42.554
Ah.

23:42.987 --> 23:44.987
It's okay. Go ahead.

23:44.989 --> 23:46.525
- Excuse me, would you?
- Yeah, please, it's okay.

23:49.493 --> 23:52.630
Hello? Hello. Hello, Suzanne.

23:54.832 --> 23:58.033
Okay. Fine, but...

23:58.035 --> 24:01.504
There's no reason
to cry about it.

24:01.506 --> 24:03.538
Um...

24:03.540 --> 24:06.544
I... I'm gonna do it
before 2:00. Okay?

24:06.943 --> 24:08.276
What?

24:08.278 --> 24:10.578
Yes, I'll leave the deposit
before 2:00.

24:10.580 --> 24:12.180
I'm busy now.

24:12.182 --> 24:14.653
Just relax, right?

24:16.554 --> 24:17.556
Bye.

24:19.056 --> 24:20.523
Mm.

24:20.525 --> 24:25.661
- So, are you divorced or not?
- I am. I am.

24:25.663 --> 24:26.961
Hmm, but...

24:26.963 --> 24:28.730
You get divorced from
the woman, not the kids.

24:28.732 --> 24:30.065
- Ah.
- Yes.

24:30.067 --> 24:32.567
I've been living alone now
for a year.

24:32.569 --> 24:37.006
But I still have to help out
the girls a lot.

24:37.008 --> 24:40.711
They're...
They're very dependent on me.

24:42.579 --> 24:47.048
It's just the way things are,
so, you know...

24:47.050 --> 24:50.688
It's not all of me,
but it's a part of me.

24:52.557 --> 24:55.324
My life used to be
very different.

24:55.326 --> 24:58.697
I was drowning,
about to blow and then...

25:00.730 --> 25:03.699
About a year and a month ago,
I had surgery.

25:03.701 --> 25:04.702
What kind of surgery?

25:06.069 --> 25:08.237
Gastric bypass.

25:08.239 --> 25:11.606
- I used to weight 280 pounds.
- I don't believe you.

25:11.608 --> 25:13.074
- I swear.
- No.

25:13.076 --> 25:14.910
- It's true.
- No. I... I...

25:14.912 --> 25:16.879
I was huge, really.

25:16.881 --> 25:18.646
If you don't believe me,
here you go.

25:18.648 --> 25:20.649
All right, all right.

25:20.651 --> 25:23.288
It's there, see?
Look at that, see?

25:26.757 --> 25:28.690
- I had a size 52 waist.
- I'm sorry.

25:28.692 --> 25:29.691
Very little neck.

25:29.693 --> 25:31.893
I'm sorry. I'm...

25:53.217 --> 25:55.784
Oh... Whoa. Whoa!

25:55.786 --> 25:57.622
I got you. I got you.

25:58.788 --> 26:00.689
Okay. Okay.

26:00.691 --> 26:02.624
Oh. Oh!

26:02.626 --> 26:04.826
This is the hopper,
where the paintballs go in.

26:04.828 --> 26:05.928
Okay.

26:05.930 --> 26:10.132
This is the pod
with 140 paintballs.

26:10.134 --> 26:11.633
And now, you take the gun.

26:11.635 --> 26:13.001
- You want me to hold it?
- Yeah, okay.

26:13.003 --> 26:16.238
You put your hand there
and this hand around here.

26:16.240 --> 26:17.405
- Okay. Mmm-hmm.
- Okay?

26:17.407 --> 26:18.774
- You got it?
- I have it.

26:18.776 --> 26:21.709
This is the trigger.
All right? Okay?

26:21.711 --> 26:24.646
This is the safety.
Take the safety off.

26:24.648 --> 26:26.748
Now it's an automatic.
Okay, now be careful.

26:26.750 --> 26:27.982
- Do you want me to shoot?
- Not yet.

26:27.984 --> 26:31.719
Look through the sight,
okay? All right.

26:31.721 --> 26:33.354
- A little more...
- Okay.

26:33.356 --> 26:35.090
- A little more at the target.
- At the guy.

26:35.092 --> 26:36.290
- Right. Okay?
- At the guy.

26:36.292 --> 26:37.692
- You can see him, right?
- Yes, I can see him.

26:37.694 --> 26:39.661
- Okay? And...
- Okay. And...

26:42.199 --> 26:44.669
- You hit the bull's-eye.
- I think he's dead.

26:46.336 --> 26:48.703
I love your park.

26:48.705 --> 26:52.040
You know, men,
they like to play war.

26:52.042 --> 26:53.808
I do know that.

26:59.150 --> 27:00.752
Capturing the flag.

27:02.153 --> 27:03.387
Protecting the president.

27:05.690 --> 27:07.325
- Zombie attack.
- Hmm.

27:26.042 --> 27:27.144
Hmm.

28:51.961 --> 28:54.962
- Is that him?
- Yeah.

28:54.964 --> 28:59.934
It's this weird mix of
happiness and...

28:59.936 --> 29:02.171
And anxiety. I've...

29:02.173 --> 29:04.472
I've never felt anything
like this before.

29:04.474 --> 29:06.176
I think it's called love,
honey.

29:10.914 --> 29:14.283
- Oh, my God!
- It's fine, Mom.

29:14.285 --> 29:17.986
- He gets paid to do this?
- Yeah. It's his job.

29:17.988 --> 29:21.289
He's a big wave surfer,
like an extreme surfer.

29:21.291 --> 29:23.026
It's what he loves to do.

29:24.295 --> 29:25.997
Honey, this guy could
die tomorrow.

29:26.931 --> 29:31.365
Mom. We could
all die tomorrow.

29:31.367 --> 29:34.202
I just saw the news
where they sent a boy home

29:34.204 --> 29:37.104
for just making a gun
with his hand.

29:37.106 --> 29:39.941
Oh, wow. You cannot stop boys
from playing with guns.

29:39.943 --> 29:41.375
And if they don't have one,

29:41.377 --> 29:43.144
they're gonna make everything
into a gun.

29:43.146 --> 29:44.546
Mmm-hmm.
When Peter was little,

29:44.548 --> 29:46.347
he went into my purse and
made a gun out of a tampon.

29:48.986 --> 29:51.823
Yeah. What was the trigger?

29:54.892 --> 29:58.160
See, we can't even outlaw guns
in our own families.

29:58.162 --> 29:59.862
That's true.

29:59.864 --> 30:01.930
But the fact that a civilian
can just walk in

30:01.932 --> 30:04.900
and buy
a military-style assault rifle

30:04.902 --> 30:06.301
is just beyond me.

30:06.303 --> 30:09.872
Well, the majority of
gun owners are responsible.

30:09.874 --> 30:11.873
This is not about
the majority.

30:11.875 --> 30:14.508
The responsibility
that you're referring to

30:14.510 --> 30:16.378
is what is going to blow up
the whole planet.

30:16.380 --> 30:18.913
The planet is as good as
blown-up already, my dear.

30:18.915 --> 30:20.882
We're just arranged
in the deck chairs

30:20.884 --> 30:23.418
- of <i>Titanic</i> at this point.
- Mmm-hmm.

30:23.420 --> 30:25.487
I don't think we should panic.

30:25.489 --> 30:28.023
Everything goes in cycles.
It's natural.

30:28.025 --> 30:31.259
Besides, every generation
thinks it's the end.

30:31.261 --> 30:33.228
The worst it's ever been.

30:33.230 --> 30:36.067
And one generation
will be right.

30:37.968 --> 30:39.500
Well, when the world blows up,

30:39.502 --> 30:41.236
I hope I go down dancing.

30:41.238 --> 30:43.037
Hey-hey!

30:43.039 --> 30:44.506
- Right?
- Yes!

31:10.433 --> 31:14.271
Because everything is
changing, it's transforming.

31:15.405 --> 31:19.106
All the time.
Even our physical bodies.

31:19.108 --> 31:21.075
I was reading in the science
section of the paper

31:21.077 --> 31:23.210
about cell renewal.

31:23.212 --> 31:24.947
Do you know about that?

31:24.949 --> 31:26.581
Yeah. Yeah,
I've heard something.

31:26.583 --> 31:32.554
Basically, it said that, um,
our bodies,

31:32.556 --> 31:34.957
even middle-aged bodies,

31:34.959 --> 31:37.092
are less than 10 years old.

31:37.094 --> 31:42.229
Our skin. The epidermis is
recycled every two weeks.

31:42.231 --> 31:47.969
Our bones, the human skeleton
is replaced every 10 years.

31:47.971 --> 31:50.338
And each organ, you know,

31:50.340 --> 31:52.507
renews itself
at a separate rate

31:52.509 --> 31:54.945
and so everything is...

32:00.017 --> 32:01.182
<i>♪ And I don't know ♪</i>

32:01.184 --> 32:03.153
<i>♪ If I'm just dreaming ♪</i>

32:03.988 --> 32:07.488
<i>♪ I don't know if I feel safe ♪</i>

32:07.490 --> 32:12.059
<i>♪ But it's something
That I must believe in ♪</i>

32:12.061 --> 32:15.532
<i>♪ And it's there
When you call out my name ♪</i>

32:23.039 --> 32:25.774
<i>♪ Oh! Love is in the air ♪</i>

32:25.776 --> 32:29.980
"I'd like to be a nest
if you were a little bird.

32:31.048 --> 32:32.383
"I'd like to be a scarf

32:33.384 --> 32:35.519
"if you were a neck
and were cold.

32:37.020 --> 32:39.523
"If you were music,
I'd be an ear.

32:41.090 --> 32:43.327
"If you were water,
I'd be a glass.

32:44.361 --> 32:47.131
"If you were light,
I'd be an eye.

32:48.731 --> 32:51.565
"If you were a foot,
I'd be a sock."

32:53.170 --> 32:56.203
"And if you were the sea,
I'd be a beach.

32:56.205 --> 32:59.576
"And if you were still
the sea, I'd be a fish,

33:00.411 --> 33:03.144
"and I'd swim in you.

33:03.146 --> 33:05.212
"And if you were the sea,
I'd be salt.

33:05.214 --> 33:08.417
"And if I were salt,
you'd be lettuce,

33:08.419 --> 33:12.353
"an avocado or at least
a fried egg."

33:14.090 --> 33:19.227
"And if you were a fried egg,
I'd be a piece of bread.

33:19.229 --> 33:20.528
"And if I were
a piece of bread,

33:20.530 --> 33:22.264
"you'd be butter or jam.

33:22.266 --> 33:23.401
"And if you were jam,

33:24.601 --> 33:27.201
"I'd be the peach in the jam.

33:27.203 --> 33:31.041
"If I were a peach,
you'd be a tree.

33:32.675 --> 33:36.077
"And if you were a tree,
I'd be your sap.

33:36.079 --> 33:40.117
"And I'd course through
your arms like blood.

33:42.152 --> 33:43.388
"And if I were blood,

33:46.123 --> 33:47.557
"I'd live in your heart."

34:13.117 --> 34:14.248
Hello?

34:15.885 --> 34:17.788
Helen. Uh...

34:18.889 --> 34:20.291
Hello. How are you?

34:24.494 --> 34:26.130
Good. How about you?

34:28.164 --> 34:29.333
That's nice.

34:30.467 --> 34:31.568
Yes.

34:34.304 --> 34:36.139
I've already had lunch.

34:38.775 --> 34:41.411
Well,
she should take her pills.

34:43.246 --> 34:45.179
What's that?

34:45.181 --> 34:47.217
Hey, what can...
What can I do about it?

34:47.784 --> 34:50.351
I'm here at home.

34:50.353 --> 34:53.588
I haven't been feeling well.
That's why I haven't been out.

34:53.590 --> 34:54.856
What? No...

34:54.858 --> 34:57.094
No, I'm not going out today.
I'm staying here.

34:57.760 --> 34:58.829
Okay?

35:00.429 --> 35:02.099
Okay? No, I don't think so.

35:04.800 --> 35:06.203
Did you like it?

35:09.338 --> 35:11.208
I don't understand, really.

35:12.775 --> 35:14.277
Where are you?

35:15.811 --> 35:17.214
Why are you here?

35:18.181 --> 35:19.248
Because I'm with you.

35:19.250 --> 35:21.550
Then why can't you tell them
that you're with me.

35:21.552 --> 35:24.885
Why? I don't want to involve
them in our thing. No way.

35:24.887 --> 35:27.289
No way. Why drag them
into a situation

35:27.291 --> 35:29.891
that they're incapable
of understanding. Why?

35:29.893 --> 35:32.226
So they can say, "Oh, my God,
you have a girlfriend?

35:32.228 --> 35:34.362
- "You stupid old man."
- You're not old.

35:34.364 --> 35:36.898
"How could you even think
of dating at your age?"

35:38.668 --> 35:40.704
I know them.
They'd make fun of me and...

35:41.572 --> 35:43.204
Why give them the chance?

35:43.206 --> 35:45.507
I thought that, you know...

35:45.509 --> 35:46.974
Um...

35:46.976 --> 35:49.311
I'm a part of your life,
aren't I?

35:49.313 --> 35:51.213
You're the most important
part of my life.

35:51.215 --> 35:52.313
Well, then I wanna feel that,

35:52.315 --> 35:55.316
and if you're lying to your
daughters, then I'm not.

35:55.318 --> 35:58.320
- They're grownups, right?
- They're not that grown up.

35:58.322 --> 36:00.822
I mean,
physically they are, but...

36:00.824 --> 36:02.557
I don't know
if it's a generational thing,

36:02.559 --> 36:04.925
but they see me
as their father,

36:04.927 --> 36:06.364
not as a person.

36:07.530 --> 36:09.733
I've always been the one
worrying about them.

36:11.568 --> 36:13.938
And they've never worried
about me, not at all.

36:17.541 --> 36:19.210
It's a really lonely feeling.

36:21.277 --> 36:22.846
And I don't want you to

36:24.748 --> 36:26.184
have to experience that.

37:27.443 --> 37:28.913
Hello?

37:30.012 --> 37:33.014
Open the door.

37:33.016 --> 37:35.286
- Open the fucking door.
- Hey!

37:39.356 --> 37:41.525
Shit!

37:43.025 --> 37:44.358
Shit!

37:44.360 --> 37:45.793
This is not your door.

37:47.664 --> 37:49.300
What are you doing?

37:50.000 --> 37:52.333
Fucking bitch!

38:46.989 --> 38:49.523
I'm so happy you could come.

38:49.525 --> 38:51.394
Thanks for bringing me.

38:53.163 --> 38:56.731
- Happy Birthday, sweetheart.
- Thanks.

38:56.733 --> 39:00.068
Ooh! This is gonna be
a wonderful year for you.

39:00.070 --> 39:01.403
Thanks.

39:01.405 --> 39:03.670
- Oh, it's gonna be just great.
- Okay.

39:03.672 --> 39:05.440
I can feel it. I know.

39:05.442 --> 39:07.575
And I can help you
with anything you need.

39:07.577 --> 39:09.077
Thanks, Mom.

39:09.079 --> 39:11.545
- This is Arnold.
- Hi, Arnold.

39:11.547 --> 39:14.017
- Hi. Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

39:15.418 --> 39:17.017
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:17.019 --> 39:21.555
- Oh, you look so nice.
- Oh, thank you.

39:21.557 --> 39:23.023
- Mm.
- Hello.

39:23.025 --> 39:24.726
- Hello.
- How are you?

39:24.728 --> 39:26.594
I'm well, how are you?

39:26.596 --> 39:28.630
- Good. This is nice, huh?
- Yes.

39:28.632 --> 39:30.432
My goodness.
How long has it been?

39:30.434 --> 39:32.434
- Four... I think.
- Four years?

39:32.436 --> 39:34.034
- Five, I think.
- Five?

39:34.036 --> 39:35.103
- Yes.
- Oh, what?

39:35.105 --> 39:36.204
Since you got divorced?

39:36.206 --> 39:39.139
No, actually since the last
time we saw each other.

39:39.141 --> 39:40.641
No, we got divorced
12 years ago.

39:40.643 --> 39:42.043
- Oh.
- Twelve? Really?

39:42.045 --> 39:43.577
Yes. Oh, you must be Fiona.

39:43.579 --> 39:44.945
- Hi. Hi.
- Yeah.

39:44.947 --> 39:46.981
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, it's so nice to meet you.

39:46.983 --> 39:48.983
Oh, my goodness,
you are so pretty.

39:48.985 --> 39:50.083
- Oh...
- You didn't tell me

39:50.085 --> 39:51.586
- how pretty she is.
- Please.

39:51.588 --> 39:54.456
- No, beautiful.
- No, She is.

39:54.458 --> 39:55.722
So you haven't introduces us.

39:55.724 --> 39:59.092
Oh, I'm so sorry.
This is my friend Arnold.

39:59.094 --> 40:01.929
- Um, that's my ex-husband.
- Okay.

40:01.931 --> 40:03.798
- Dustin.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

40:03.800 --> 40:06.501
- And his wife, Fiona.
- A pleasure.

40:06.503 --> 40:08.503
Nice to meet you.

40:08.505 --> 40:09.604
- Cheers.
- Thanks, everyone.

40:09.606 --> 40:11.940
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

40:11.942 --> 40:13.844
I'm happy.
Thanks for being here.

40:16.679 --> 40:18.679
- Mm.
- Ah.

40:18.681 --> 40:20.914
And cheers.

40:20.916 --> 40:22.519
- Cheers.
- To your pregnancy.

40:28.625 --> 40:31.829
- Oh, you didn't know?
- No, I didn't.

40:33.663 --> 40:34.494
You're pregnant?

40:34.496 --> 40:35.863
- You didn't tell him?
- No.

40:35.865 --> 40:38.536
- I'm sorry. I...
- Oh, really?

40:38.934 --> 40:41.568
That's so nice.

40:41.570 --> 40:43.271
It's still new,
you know, so...

40:43.273 --> 40:44.541
Yeah.

40:45.574 --> 40:46.673
Oh, well,

40:46.675 --> 40:49.978
- you're not showing at all.
- Ten weeks, so...

40:49.980 --> 40:51.211
Do you have
a boyfriend?

40:51.213 --> 40:53.514
- Yeah.
- That's great.

40:53.516 --> 40:55.583
She's the same age that I was.

40:55.585 --> 40:56.885
Aw!

40:56.887 --> 40:58.956
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

41:05.061 --> 41:06.564
Would you like
some nuts, Arnold?

41:07.597 --> 41:08.632
Yeah, sure.

41:09.666 --> 41:10.868
Thanks.

41:15.605 --> 41:16.840
Would you like an olive?

41:17.907 --> 41:18.909
Sure.

41:20.010 --> 41:22.546
- Thanks.
- Olive?

41:23.146 --> 41:24.378
Thanks.

41:24.380 --> 41:27.014
You know, the baby's the same
size as an olive right now.

41:27.016 --> 41:28.715
It is.

41:28.717 --> 41:30.487
Oh!

41:31.721 --> 41:34.021
What a nice home you two have.

41:34.023 --> 41:37.992
It's just...
This is beautiful. I love...

41:37.994 --> 41:40.193
Most of this is
Rachel's taste, but...

41:40.195 --> 41:42.630
Oh. Where is she?

41:42.632 --> 41:44.164
I have no idea.

41:44.166 --> 41:47.001
Well, I like it too.
Congratulations.

41:47.003 --> 41:49.606
Thanks. We're moving out soon.

41:51.907 --> 41:54.708
So you guys got any plans
for Christmas?

41:54.710 --> 41:56.043
Do you celebrate that?

41:56.045 --> 41:59.112
Oh, my gosh, I haven't even
thought about that.

41:59.114 --> 42:01.583
We're spending it together.

42:01.585 --> 42:04.017
- Oh. Mmm-hmm.
- Of course. Yeah.

42:04.019 --> 42:05.619
Arnold, my mom tells me
that you have

42:05.621 --> 42:08.021
some kind of, um,
amusement park type thing.

42:08.023 --> 42:12.092
- Uh, yes. Vertigo park.
- It's so much fun.

42:12.094 --> 42:14.061
- Have you ever done paintball?
- No, I haven't.

42:14.063 --> 42:15.630
Is it real paint?

42:15.632 --> 42:18.666
Yes, it's real paint
and it's in two teams.

42:18.668 --> 42:20.068
So it's kind of like a...

42:20.070 --> 42:21.869
I guess it's like
a pretend war.

42:21.871 --> 42:23.871
- She loved it.
- I did. I loved it!

42:23.873 --> 42:25.639
You did paintball?

42:25.641 --> 42:27.108
Well, I just did
the target shooting.

42:27.110 --> 42:29.776
She has great aim.

42:29.778 --> 42:32.613
Yeah, she sure does, yes, sir.

42:32.615 --> 42:34.115
What did you do before?

42:34.117 --> 42:36.818
I... I was a marine.

42:36.820 --> 42:38.385
After that, I started

42:38.387 --> 42:40.223
transporting equipment
for them.

42:40.990 --> 42:42.724
Were you an officer?

42:42.726 --> 42:44.791
Yes. Of course.

42:44.793 --> 42:46.661
So you were a military.

42:46.663 --> 42:49.296
Yeah. I went in to, uh,
pay for school.

42:49.298 --> 42:53.233
- Do you have any children?
- Two daughters.

42:53.235 --> 42:56.104
- How old are they?
- 27 and 31.

42:56.106 --> 42:57.639
Oh. So like us,
more and less.

42:57.641 --> 42:58.639
- Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah.

42:58.641 --> 43:02.779
Well, they're pretty different
from you guys.

43:04.813 --> 43:07.914
- Are you a grandfather?
- No, no.

43:07.916 --> 43:09.650
And they aren't married?

43:09.652 --> 43:12.353
No, they're single.

43:12.355 --> 43:14.255
Very single.

43:14.257 --> 43:15.956
What do they do?

43:15.958 --> 43:18.127
You mean
at this particular moment?

43:19.795 --> 43:22.329
Nothing.
They're doing nothing.

43:22.331 --> 43:25.666
No, but one of them just had
a meeting with a friend

43:25.668 --> 43:27.702
who owns a pet store and that
went very well, didn't it?

43:27.704 --> 43:29.670
Yeah, it did. Yeah.

43:29.672 --> 43:32.673
And it has the potential
to be very lucrative.

43:32.675 --> 43:34.441
People love their pets.

43:34.443 --> 43:36.110
What part of town
are they in?

43:36.112 --> 43:38.378
Oh, Redondo. With their mom.

43:38.380 --> 43:41.682
Uh, you know,
high rents and all that stuff.

43:41.684 --> 43:43.052
And what does Mom do?

43:45.855 --> 43:47.057
She's a, you know...

43:52.896 --> 43:54.162
That's amazing.

43:54.164 --> 43:57.130
- Do you want some weed?
- Oh. No. Thank you.

43:57.132 --> 43:58.900
No? You don't smoke?

43:58.902 --> 44:00.133
Well, no. I mean, I've...

44:00.135 --> 44:02.672
I tried it long time ago,
but now I...

44:03.472 --> 44:05.305
I'm afraid I'd lose control.

44:05.307 --> 44:07.710
No, don't be silly.

44:08.478 --> 44:10.077
- Are you sure?
- No.

44:10.079 --> 44:12.479
Well, everybody reacts
differently,

44:12.481 --> 44:14.981
so if you don't mind,
I'll just...

45:36.231 --> 45:38.067
Who's my grandson's father?

45:39.135 --> 45:40.504
His name is Theo.

45:41.804 --> 45:43.005
Theo?

45:43.940 --> 45:46.175
- Theo what?
- Van Gogh.

45:48.143 --> 45:51.144
It doesn't matter.
He's Swedish.

45:51.146 --> 45:52.979
- Swedish?
- Mmm-hmm.

45:52.981 --> 45:56.950
- Like, does he live here?
- No, he lives in Sweden.

45:56.952 --> 46:01.121
- But he's coming to live here.
- No, he's staying there.

46:01.123 --> 46:03.958
- How come?
- I'm moving there.

46:03.960 --> 46:06.594
- She's leaving.
- To go to Sweden?

46:06.596 --> 46:08.128
Mmm-hmm. Yes.

46:08.130 --> 46:10.597
Wouldn't you?
I'd love to move to fucking Sweden.

46:13.101 --> 46:15.202
- When?
- On the 28th.

46:15.204 --> 46:17.840
- It's so soon.
- Yes.

46:18.173 --> 46:19.376
Wha...

46:20.443 --> 46:21.675
You know what, honey?

46:21.677 --> 46:23.911
Why don't you read your dad
the letter that he wrote you?

46:23.913 --> 46:25.378
- E-mail, Mom.
- Okay, the e-mail.

46:25.380 --> 46:27.014
Read him the e-mail
so he can see.

46:27.016 --> 46:28.148
- No.
- He's a wonderful guy.

46:28.150 --> 46:30.016
He's just...
Oh, he's so lovely

46:30.018 --> 46:31.885
and I think we're both a bit
in love with Theo too.

46:31.887 --> 46:33.287
No. Mom...

46:33.289 --> 46:36.023
- Why, Annie? Come on.
- Just cut it out.

46:36.025 --> 46:37.827
It'll be nice for your dad.

46:48.905 --> 46:54.008
"The only thing I want is
to have a life with you.

46:54.010 --> 46:56.376
"I discovered
that the love in my heart

46:56.378 --> 46:57.880
"was being saved for you.

47:00.884 --> 47:04.084
"Living the mystery
of every day with you

47:04.086 --> 47:06.556
"is the most profound thing
I can imagine.

47:07.990 --> 47:10.992
"I may have been on the
biggest waves in the world,

47:10.994 --> 47:12.559
"in the deepest waters,

47:12.561 --> 47:15.965
"but the deepest thing I can
think of is to be with you."

47:19.268 --> 47:21.269
Oh, my.

47:21.271 --> 47:23.070
Everything is making me cry
these days.

47:23.072 --> 47:24.875
I don't know why.

47:27.443 --> 47:29.110
- Mm!
- Look at these two.

47:29.112 --> 47:32.679
Look at these two little
cuties eating their apples.

47:32.681 --> 47:35.081
- Oh, they're so cute!
- You loved apples.

47:35.083 --> 47:37.083
The people thought
they were twins.

47:37.085 --> 47:38.219
- They looked like twins.
- I know.

47:38.221 --> 47:41.354
Our wedding pictures.
Here we are, stiff as boards.

47:41.356 --> 47:44.057
- We were so naive.
- Oh, we were so in love.

47:44.059 --> 47:46.693
- We were very naive.
- We were in love.

47:46.695 --> 47:47.762
Hold it up, hold it up.

47:47.764 --> 47:49.930
- No, Peter.
- No, for one second.

47:49.932 --> 47:50.932
Let's do a quick
"then and now"

47:50.934 --> 47:52.700
- What's happening?
- Peter, we were in love.

47:52.702 --> 47:54.434
I know
you were in love.

47:54.436 --> 47:57.104
Okay. Just hurry up.
Hurry up, okay?

47:57.106 --> 47:59.039
- Don't cut my head off.
- No, no.

47:59.041 --> 48:00.641
She's laughing.

48:00.643 --> 48:03.110
- We were laughing.
- No, stop.

48:03.112 --> 48:05.012
You look
so much happier now.

48:05.014 --> 48:07.715
- Send me a copy. Peter.
- I'll send it.

48:07.717 --> 48:09.115
Please, send me a...

48:09.117 --> 48:11.117
Oh.

48:11.119 --> 48:13.287
- Look.
- Oh, yeah, okay.

48:13.289 --> 48:15.088
Yeah we look great. Yeah.

48:15.090 --> 48:17.590
Oh, look at Petey
with his necklace.

48:17.592 --> 48:19.659
Look at your necklace.
Look at that.

48:19.661 --> 48:21.095
I bought it
on the beach.

48:21.097 --> 48:22.963
- Really?
- He loved his jewelry. Right?

48:22.965 --> 48:24.264
- Aw!
- Isn't he sweet?

48:24.266 --> 48:25.999
- Oh, look at you!
- Oh!

48:26.001 --> 48:27.969
I know. And here's Annie.

48:27.971 --> 48:30.304
This is the day that
she graduated from preschool.

48:30.306 --> 48:33.007
I know because I remember
that dress.

48:33.009 --> 48:35.108
- Look at you in that dress.
- I remember that dress.

48:35.110 --> 48:36.344
It's so cute.

48:38.114 --> 48:40.447
Oh, this... Oh, my God.
Here's our wedding cake.

48:40.449 --> 48:42.115
We couldn't get married
with just any cake.

48:42.117 --> 48:43.684
It had to be bigger
than we were.

48:43.686 --> 48:44.619
Take a look at that.

48:44.621 --> 48:47.021
Oh, but look at
that frilly dress!

48:47.023 --> 48:48.655
Well... It was 1986.

48:48.657 --> 48:50.523
- Okay, that's hilarious.
- That's what we wore then.

48:50.525 --> 48:53.994
- I was not here.
- No. You were gone by then.

48:53.996 --> 48:55.362
No. I wasn't.

48:55.364 --> 48:56.463
Wow.

48:56.465 --> 48:58.632
I should've been here. Here.

48:58.634 --> 49:01.001
- And I wasn't!
- All right.

49:01.003 --> 49:02.204
All right.

49:03.672 --> 49:05.074
I wasn't here.

49:09.344 --> 49:11.045
All right,
let's calm down.

49:11.047 --> 49:13.050
Dad, you want some water?

49:18.086 --> 49:19.989
Arnold?

49:24.226 --> 49:26.163
Arnold? Are you in there?

49:36.172 --> 49:37.470
Maybe he went
down to his car.

49:37.472 --> 49:38.541
No, Mom.

49:39.541 --> 49:41.508
- He's not here.
- He's not.

49:41.510 --> 49:42.575
Oh, no,

49:42.577 --> 49:44.244
now we woke up the baby.

49:44.246 --> 49:46.514
Jeez.
Do you think he got sick?

49:46.516 --> 49:48.048
Uh, I don't know.

49:48.050 --> 49:50.650
Maybe the food that he ate
didn't agree with him.

49:50.652 --> 49:52.186
He did seem a bit off.

49:52.188 --> 49:54.054
Hmm. Oh.

49:54.056 --> 49:55.023
He's not downstairs.

49:55.025 --> 49:56.590
I'm gonna get the...
I'm gonna get the baby.

49:56.592 --> 49:58.425
No, no, no.
I'll do that, just...

49:58.427 --> 50:00.262
Okay. You got him.

50:01.664 --> 50:03.130
I'm gonna give him a call.

50:03.132 --> 50:05.034
I'll see if I can get him
on the phone.

50:06.536 --> 50:08.202
All right.

50:08.204 --> 50:10.237
Is there another way
to get out?

50:10.239 --> 50:12.173
No, it's just the
entrance and the black door.

50:12.175 --> 50:14.075
- It was just a photo.
- I know.

50:14.077 --> 50:15.575
- It was ages ago.
- Yeah.

50:15.577 --> 50:17.211
Did you say
something, Dad?

50:17.213 --> 50:19.546
Nothing.
You were here.

50:21.684 --> 50:24.354
Arnold. It's Gloria.
What happened?

50:25.221 --> 50:26.619
Um...

50:26.621 --> 50:29.222
I'm still at Peter's
and I'm worried,

50:29.224 --> 50:32.628
so give me call and let me
know where you are, okay?

50:33.396 --> 50:34.431
Okay, bye.

50:39.402 --> 50:43.737
Sometimes he feels sick.
He had surgery recently,

50:43.739 --> 50:47.110
and he has a hard time
digesting things.

50:49.144 --> 50:50.447
He had a lot of olives.

50:53.882 --> 50:55.785
So, I think that I...

50:57.186 --> 50:58.488
I probably...

51:00.289 --> 51:02.123
- Thank you. Uh...
- I don't...

51:02.125 --> 51:05.758
- I'm sure he'll reappear.
- Yeah.

51:05.760 --> 51:09.130
- Well, thank you for coming.
- Thank you so much.

51:09.132 --> 51:11.764
Okay. Mmm-hmm.

51:11.766 --> 51:13.669
- All right.
- I'm driving.

51:34.190 --> 51:35.192
No answer.

51:40.695 --> 51:43.467
Okay. I should go.

51:44.867 --> 51:46.303
Who is this guy, Mom?

51:55.244 --> 51:56.480
Who are you with?

52:57.239 --> 52:59.373
Arnold? I'm busy.

52:59.375 --> 53:00.374
I'm working.

53:19.394 --> 53:20.961
What are you doing here?

53:20.963 --> 53:23.396
Can we talk?

53:23.398 --> 53:25.432
I don't have anything
to say to you.

53:25.434 --> 53:26.934
I really need you
to listen to me.

53:26.936 --> 53:28.601
I do.

53:28.603 --> 53:30.371
How could you be
so rude, Arnold?

53:30.373 --> 53:31.604
For what?

53:31.606 --> 53:33.941
I was introducing you
to my family.

53:33.943 --> 53:36.443
I brought you
to my son's birthday party

53:36.445 --> 53:37.510
and you have the nerve
to just disappear.

53:37.512 --> 53:38.912
If you were me, you would've
done the same thing.

53:38.914 --> 53:41.315
- It wasn't an easy situation.
- Really?

53:41.317 --> 53:45.385
I searched for your eyes
again and again.

53:45.387 --> 53:48.289
I didn't exist.
"We were in love."

53:48.291 --> 53:49.657
- Oh, please.
- "We were in love."

53:49.659 --> 53:50.592
- He didn't mean to...
- How many times

53:50.594 --> 53:51.825
- did he have to say that?
- He was drunk.

53:51.827 --> 53:54.264
- He was... He...
- It made me sick!

53:54.996 --> 53:56.195
I threw up.

53:56.197 --> 53:59.301
I don't know how you could
do something like that to me.

54:03.972 --> 54:05.909
And the girls called, so...

54:09.445 --> 54:10.647
Grow a pair.

54:12.347 --> 54:15.648
Take your...
Take your toy guns with you.

54:15.650 --> 54:16.685
Gloria.

54:18.019 --> 54:20.623
- No. No, Gloria.
- Okay, fine. Okay, fine.

54:21.456 --> 54:22.923
Then I'll keep them.

54:22.925 --> 54:24.425
- Gloria, don't go.
- I don't want to run you over.

54:24.427 --> 54:26.827
- Gloria.
- Arnold, please!

54:26.829 --> 54:29.496
- I love you, Gloria.
- Just get... Get away!

54:29.498 --> 54:30.530
I love you, you understand?

54:30.532 --> 54:32.499
- Get away from the car.
- Please!

54:32.501 --> 54:34.437
Gloria! Gloria!

54:46.614 --> 54:47.981
Those are your toes?

54:47.983 --> 54:49.115
How many toes?

54:49.117 --> 54:52.855
One, two, three,
four, five. Five.

54:53.621 --> 54:54.723
Five.

54:55.657 --> 54:59.663
One, two, three, four, five.

55:04.132 --> 55:06.368
One. Two.

Don't squint
in this eye.

56:58.646 --> 57:01.481
- That's great.
- So how are your kids?

57:01.483 --> 57:03.650
They must be like
four and six now, right?

57:03.652 --> 57:05.552
Hold on. Don't talk.

57:05.554 --> 57:08.490
When you talk, your eye moves
and I can't see.

57:09.123 --> 57:10.858
What?

57:10.860 --> 57:13.092
- Am I going blind?
- No.

57:13.094 --> 57:14.695
Not necessarily.

57:14.697 --> 57:17.130
But in time,
if you don't take care of it,

57:17.132 --> 57:19.166
your field of vision
will get smaller,

57:19.168 --> 57:21.001
which will limit
your day-to-day life.

57:21.003 --> 57:24.003
Like driving,
getting around...

57:24.005 --> 57:25.805
So I'm afraid
I'm going to have to

57:25.807 --> 57:27.541
prescribe you these eye drops.

57:27.543 --> 57:31.512
They're to be taken
in each eye twice a day. Okay?

57:31.514 --> 57:33.579
For how long?

57:33.581 --> 57:35.818
Unfortunately,
for the rest of your life.

58:14.222 --> 58:15.722
Please call me
if you wanna talk.

58:15.724 --> 58:17.257
Mmm-hmm.

58:25.099 --> 58:27.202
Thank you for everything,
Gloria.

58:29.038 --> 58:32.338
Or e-mail me, text me.
Any time.

58:32.340 --> 58:34.076
I will.

58:47.623 --> 58:48.625
Gloria.

58:49.724 --> 58:52.628
- These came for you.
- Thank you.

59:07.076 --> 59:10.776
If you cut your hair or do
something different to it,

59:10.778 --> 59:12.746
then people think it's
the hair that's different.

59:12.748 --> 59:13.947
That's why you look different.

59:13.949 --> 59:15.782
- Mmm-hmm.
- They don't notice

59:15.784 --> 59:16.684
the other stuff.

59:18.119 --> 59:20.253
Here comes the bride.

59:20.255 --> 59:22.990
- You look gorgeous.
- Wow. Wow.

59:22.992 --> 59:24.758
- Really?
- Yeah.

59:24.760 --> 59:25.758
Really? Is it not too much?

59:25.760 --> 59:28.228
No, no, no. It's special
enough for the big day.

59:28.230 --> 59:29.295
But you still look
like yourself.

59:29.297 --> 59:31.398
Yeah.

59:31.400 --> 59:34.233
All right. My hair is next,
so I'll be back.

59:34.235 --> 59:35.334
Okay.

59:35.336 --> 59:37.269
It's gonna be
a great wedding.

59:39.108 --> 59:40.943
She's such a beautiful girl.

59:48.182 --> 59:50.650
He calls me
every five minutes.

59:50.652 --> 59:51.653
Don't pick it up.

59:52.755 --> 59:54.123
No, I won't.

01:00:01.362 --> 01:00:03.165
Hello.

01:00:04.699 --> 01:00:06.134
Nope, it's Vicky.

01:00:07.302 --> 01:00:11.804
Uh, she is in the bathroom.

01:00:11.806 --> 01:00:14.610
And, uh, it's gonna
take a long time.

01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:16.945
Mmm-hmm.

01:00:18.012 --> 01:00:19.215
Yeah.

01:00:20.282 --> 01:00:21.684
Okay.

01:00:22.317 --> 01:00:23.318
Bye-bye.

01:00:27.056 --> 01:00:29.692
I can't believe you did that.

01:00:38.733 --> 01:00:40.166
I'm gonna jump out
and see you off.

01:00:40.168 --> 01:00:41.702
No, Mom.

01:00:41.704 --> 01:00:43.737
To help you with your luggage,
Annie. It's heavy.

01:00:43.739 --> 01:00:45.407
No, Mom.
Just leave me here, please.

01:00:47.242 --> 01:00:48.874
I'm not gonna cry.

01:00:48.876 --> 01:00:50.476
I'm just... I'm just gonna

01:00:50.478 --> 01:00:51.980
- walk you to the entrance...
- Mom.

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.789
Just be careful, okay?

01:01:01.856 --> 01:01:02.988
Yes.

01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:04.391
And e-mail me
when you get there,

01:01:04.393 --> 01:01:06.059
just, you know, to let me know
that you're safe.

01:01:06.061 --> 01:01:08.164
Just "I'm here."
It's all I need.

01:01:09.264 --> 01:01:10.700
Yes, Mom.

01:01:12.367 --> 01:01:13.769
It's fine.

01:01:19.373 --> 01:01:21.743
- Take care of my books for me.
- I will.

01:01:22.811 --> 01:01:24.713
- Don't sell them.
- I won't.

01:01:29.885 --> 01:01:31.254
I love you very much.

01:01:42.130 --> 01:01:44.865
Okay, baby, okay.

01:01:44.867 --> 01:01:46.069
All right.

01:01:47.969 --> 01:01:49.903
Okay.

01:01:49.905 --> 01:01:51.307
Okay. Okay.

01:02:14.163 --> 01:02:17.400
Come on, come on.

01:02:41.456 --> 01:02:43.826
- Please step back, ma'am.
- Oh, sorry.

01:03:06.849 --> 01:03:07.850
Bitch!

01:03:08.983 --> 01:03:10.519
That's what you are.

01:03:12.887 --> 01:03:14.054
Bitch!

01:03:15.456 --> 01:03:17.159
Fucking dumb bitch!

01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:19.996
That's what you are!

01:03:21.163 --> 01:03:23.065
What's it all for, huh?

01:03:25.132 --> 01:03:27.499
What's it all for? Nothing!

01:03:31.039 --> 01:03:34.010
You gave me nothing!
I gave you everything!

01:03:37.211 --> 01:03:41.046
Oh, you made her fucking
love me, did you?

01:03:41.048 --> 01:03:43.820
You fucking...
You've just fucked me around!

01:04:05.172 --> 01:04:07.007
Your coffee, ma'am.

01:05:36.530 --> 01:05:37.967
Arnold?

01:05:47.141 --> 01:05:49.010
- Okay, thank you.
- Oh, you're welcome.

01:06:03.125 --> 01:06:04.327
Thank you.

01:06:05.159 --> 01:06:06.494
Thank you so much.

01:06:07.561 --> 01:06:09.028
- Enjoy Vegas, sir.
- Thanks.

01:06:09.030 --> 01:06:10.465
It's beautiful.

01:06:23.744 --> 01:06:25.811
Good afternoon.
Welcome to Caesars Palace.

01:06:25.813 --> 01:06:29.081
Hello. I have a reservation.

01:06:29.083 --> 01:06:31.818
- Under what name?
- Arnold Tenner.

01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:34.155
Welcome, Mr. Tenner.
One moment, please.

01:07:33.181 --> 01:07:34.083
Honey.

01:07:34.782 --> 01:07:36.184
Hello?

01:07:39.121 --> 01:07:40.588
What's happened now?

01:07:42.757 --> 01:07:46.228
Well...
I'm out of town. Why?

01:07:49.431 --> 01:07:50.499
What?

01:07:52.833 --> 01:07:54.069
But how?

01:07:58.306 --> 01:08:00.608
How did she go through
a window?

01:08:02.309 --> 01:08:03.311
What the...

01:08:08.182 --> 01:08:10.619
Are the...
Are the cuts deep?

01:08:11.186 --> 01:08:12.421
Are they deep?

01:08:14.456 --> 01:08:15.858
I'm really sorry.

01:08:19.761 --> 01:08:22.430
I can't come now. I'm busy.

01:08:24.466 --> 01:08:26.836
The doctors
can take care of it.

01:08:27.502 --> 01:08:28.800
That's what they do.

01:08:28.801 --> 01:08:31.171
Yes. The doctors.

01:08:36.344 --> 01:08:39.215
I have things to do! Please!

01:08:52.527 --> 01:08:53.729
What happened?

01:08:57.198 --> 01:08:59.567
My ex-wife's had an accident.

01:09:01.336 --> 01:09:03.305
My daughters called me and...

01:09:05.471 --> 01:09:11.313
Suzanne walked right through
a glass sliding door.

01:09:13.881 --> 01:09:17.219
It was too clean.
She didn't see it.

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:20.354
She crashed through it.

01:09:21.323 --> 01:09:25.161
Cut herself, uh, badly.

01:09:25.827 --> 01:09:27.296
On her legs.

01:09:28.761 --> 01:09:31.300
So stupid.
I just, uh, well...

01:09:35.337 --> 01:09:36.404
I am...

01:09:38.773 --> 01:09:40.274
I'm not leaving.

01:09:42.844 --> 01:09:44.680
I'm staying with you.

01:09:47.247 --> 01:09:51.286
I'm not gonna let them
take this away from me.

01:09:53.755 --> 01:09:55.791
They're not gonna
destroy my life.

01:09:57.926 --> 01:09:59.862
I'm staying here with you.

01:10:03.631 --> 01:10:04.933
It's what I want.

01:10:07.969 --> 01:10:09.204
With you.

01:10:14.275 --> 01:10:16.211
Maybe we should just go back.

01:10:26.287 --> 01:10:27.488
Gloria.

01:10:28.622 --> 01:10:29.824
Gloria.

01:10:31.458 --> 01:10:32.827
Gloria, don't go.

01:12:55.569 --> 01:12:57.570
You're doing the right thing.

01:12:57.572 --> 01:12:59.571
It's gonna be fine.

01:12:59.573 --> 01:13:01.943
Thank you for saying that.

01:13:04.112 --> 01:13:08.484
You just may not see
how difficult this is for me.

01:13:10.585 --> 01:13:12.818
How can I not see you?

01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:14.422
I'm looking straight at you.

01:13:19.594 --> 01:13:21.893
You know,
it's not just bad for them

01:13:21.895 --> 01:13:24.632
to depend on you so much.
It's bad for you too.

01:13:25.766 --> 01:13:28.470
You have the right
to your own life.

01:13:29.069 --> 01:13:31.739
Yes. I do.

01:13:50.091 --> 01:13:52.157
Do you wanna take a trip?

01:13:52.159 --> 01:13:55.594
A big trip?
Just the two of us.

01:13:55.596 --> 01:13:59.965
We could... We could
go to Europe or Spain.

01:13:59.967 --> 01:14:01.869
- Spain?
- Have you ever been to Spain?

01:14:02.770 --> 01:14:04.704
- No.
- Well, then let's go.

01:14:04.706 --> 01:14:06.938
Let's... Let's go to Spain.

01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:10.576
Let's take 10 days off work
and go dancing.

01:14:10.578 --> 01:14:12.978
We both love to dance.
Let's do it.

01:14:12.980 --> 01:14:14.483
You know,
we could die tomorrow.

01:14:24.559 --> 01:14:25.958
Turn it off, okay?

01:14:38.672 --> 01:14:40.876
All right. My goodness.

01:14:58.725 --> 01:14:59.827
All right.

01:15:18.046 --> 01:15:19.114
Mm.

01:15:35.896 --> 01:15:37.231
Cheers.

01:15:38.065 --> 01:15:39.300
To Spain.

01:15:40.068 --> 01:15:41.069
To Spain.

01:15:57.652 --> 01:15:59.688
I'll be right back.
Excuse me.

01:18:26.833 --> 01:18:28.968
Excuse me.

01:18:28.970 --> 01:18:30.936
Could I have another one,
please?

01:18:30.938 --> 01:18:31.940
Absolutely.

01:18:51.926 --> 01:18:55.294
It's weird to bet it all on 11
when my favorite number is 22.

01:18:55.296 --> 01:18:58.766
- Well, that's my birthday.
- Then we'll bet them all.

01:18:59.833 --> 01:19:01.166
What's your name?

01:19:01.168 --> 01:19:03.869
- Gloria.
- I'm Jen. Nice to meet you.

01:19:03.871 --> 01:19:07.005
- Very nice to meet you.
- Yeah. Let's see how we do.

01:19:07.007 --> 01:19:08.808
No more bets, please.

01:19:16.984 --> 01:19:18.017
Black 22.

01:19:18.019 --> 01:19:20.352
Oh, my God, we won. You won!

01:19:20.354 --> 01:19:23.822
Oh, what a job!
Congratulations!

01:19:23.824 --> 01:19:25.324
- Good for you!
- Thanks!

01:19:25.326 --> 01:19:27.425
Oh. This is Gloria
my new friend.

01:19:27.427 --> 01:19:28.861
- Hi. Mark. How you doing?
- How are you?

01:19:28.863 --> 01:19:30.862
- Good.
- Oh, our friend Jeremy.

01:19:30.864 --> 01:19:33.434
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

01:19:37.872 --> 01:19:40.606
Let's keep it going.

01:19:40.608 --> 01:19:42.344
Twelve? All right.
I'll go with that too.

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:02.861
Oh, no, no, no! No, no, no.

01:20:02.863 --> 01:20:04.562
No, no. Please. Please.

01:20:04.564 --> 01:20:07.465
No, you have no idea.
Don't do that.

01:20:07.467 --> 01:20:09.371
Don't do it. Don't do it. No.

01:20:10.904 --> 01:20:13.004
God, no. I mean it. Really.

01:20:13.006 --> 01:20:16.310
I... Take that off.
Please take that off.

01:21:06.694 --> 01:21:09.097
Four, still here.

01:21:10.463 --> 01:21:12.434
Five, there you go.

01:21:13.199 --> 01:21:14.465
Six. Whoa!

01:21:14.467 --> 01:21:16.470
Oh.

01:23:25.265 --> 01:23:26.266
Excuse me.

01:23:27.534 --> 01:23:29.500
May I use your phone
to call LA?

01:23:29.502 --> 01:23:32.271
Oh, yes. Of course.
Uh, number?

01:23:32.273 --> 01:23:37.442
- 818-614...
- 614...

01:23:37.444 --> 01:23:40.180
- ...5329.
- ...29.

01:23:41.215 --> 01:23:43.083
- There you go.
- Thank you.

01:24:08.141 --> 01:24:09.210
Gloria.

01:24:18.118 --> 01:24:21.887
- I got your stuff.
- Thanks, Mom.

01:24:21.889 --> 01:24:25.260
- I'll pay for the tickets.
- I already bought them.

01:24:28.429 --> 01:24:30.097
I'm sorry.

01:24:55.588 --> 01:24:58.193
When did you get a cat?

01:24:59.592 --> 01:25:01.261
Just leave him.

01:25:16.609 --> 01:25:17.878
Mom.

01:25:22.349 --> 01:25:24.152
Gloria.

01:26:48.435 --> 01:26:49.737
Okay.

01:27:14.994 --> 01:27:17.364
<i>Hello? Gloria?</i>

01:27:17.965 --> 01:27:19.567
<i>Are you there?</i>

01:27:20.833 --> 01:27:22.768
<i>Say something, please.</i>

01:27:22.770 --> 01:27:25.273
<i>You have to believe me.
I'm so sorry.</i>

01:27:26.472 --> 01:27:28.309
<i>We need to save what we have.</i>

01:30:41.702 --> 01:30:43.137
Gloria?

01:30:46.506 --> 01:30:48.009
Gloria.

01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:52.113
No. No!

01:30:53.947 --> 01:30:56.113
I love you. No! No!

01:31:00.686 --> 01:31:01.988
You shot me!

01:31:02.855 --> 01:31:04.656
Dad?

01:31:04.658 --> 01:31:07.157
- What happened?
- Daddy, what happened?

01:31:07.159 --> 01:31:09.294
Oh, my God, help!
Help me get him up!

01:31:09.296 --> 01:31:11.196
Who do you think you are,
you fucking old bitch?

01:31:11.198 --> 01:31:12.563
Gloria!

01:31:12.565 --> 01:31:14.568
Come back here
and show your face, bitch!

01:31:16.002 --> 01:31:18.969
Come on and get your
skinny ass back here!

01:31:18.971 --> 01:31:20.907
Gloria!

01:32:16.630 --> 01:32:18.199
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:32:32.979 --> 01:32:37.749
- You are a vision.
- Oh, hi! Thank you, Gloria.

01:32:37.751 --> 01:32:40.085
So sorry I didn't
make it to the ceremony.

01:32:40.087 --> 01:32:42.320
No, that's okay.
It's all right.

01:32:42.322 --> 01:32:44.659
- Congratulations!
- Thank you so much for coming.

01:32:46.259 --> 01:32:47.892
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:32:47.894 --> 01:32:50.664
- Got her married.
- Oh, good for you.

01:32:51.664 --> 01:32:53.764
- Hi, Gloria.
- I'm sorry.

01:32:53.766 --> 01:32:55.834
Oh, please don't worry
about that. I'm just so happy

01:32:55.836 --> 01:32:57.802
- that you're here.
- Me too.

01:32:57.804 --> 01:32:59.137
Oh, nice.

01:32:59.139 --> 01:33:01.275
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

01:33:01.975 --> 01:33:03.174
You seem a bit odd.

01:33:03.176 --> 01:33:05.677
