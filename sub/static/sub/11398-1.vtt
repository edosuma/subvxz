<i>[# Underdog theme]</i>

00:50.183 --> 00:53.277
<i>[man] Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Simon Barsinister,</i>

00:53.353 --> 00:55.321
<i>the wickedest man in the world.</i>

00:55.388 --> 00:56.821
<i>He was evil and crazy.</i>

00:56.890 --> 01:00.826
<i>Simon and his wacky henchman, Cad,
schemed to rule the universe.</i>

01:00.894 --> 01:03.089
<i>But each time they were foiled by me,</i>

01:03.163 --> 01:06.360
<i>the greatest superhero
who ever lived... Underdog!</i>

01:38.565 --> 01:39.964
[man] Ladies and gentlemen,

01:40.033 --> 01:43.161
l come to you this evening
to discuss the growing problem

01:43.236 --> 01:45.033
of crime in our city.

01:45.105 --> 01:49.906
Here in front of me
are files of unsolved cases.

01:49.976 --> 01:52.308
<i>[Underdog] We're getting
ahead of ourselves.</i>

01:52.379 --> 01:53.846
<i>That's me in the uniform.</i>

01:53.914 --> 01:57.042
<i>I was raised, since I was just
a little puppy, to fight crime.</i>

01:57.117 --> 01:59.779
<i>Never had a family
or a place to call home.</i>

01:59.853 --> 02:03.380
<i>I was raised with one purpose
and one purpose only:</i>

02:03.456 --> 02:05.651
<i>to help people, to keep them safe.</i>

02:05.725 --> 02:07.488
<i>Nothing was going to
stand in my way.</i>

02:07.560 --> 02:08.549
[barks]

02:08.627 --> 02:12.223
- [man stops speaking]
- Easy, boy.

02:12.299 --> 02:16.235
- However, to the families involved...
- You got something, boy?

02:16.303 --> 02:18.100
- [barking]
- What was that?

02:18.171 --> 02:21.902
Alpha Dog has got a lock on the stage.
l think it's the boxes.

02:21.975 --> 02:24.808
Criminals should not be allowed
to keep their freedom.

02:24.878 --> 02:26.641
- [howling]
- Clear the building!

02:26.713 --> 02:29.944
[man] We need SWAT here, now!
Please hurry, your honor.

02:30.016 --> 02:31.643
[man 2] Everybody out!

02:36.356 --> 02:38.824
Blue team, go, go! Move!

[electronic beeping]

No radiation.

No metal.

02:49.569 --> 02:51.764
Tweezers, and we'll lift.

02:51.838 --> 02:55.069
Easy. Right down the side.

02:55.141 --> 02:58.599
Yeah. Slow. And slide.

<i>I bet you didn't know

<i>Well, mine's not.</i>

the American Pork Association.

03:14.894 --> 03:16.418
[laughter]

03:16.496 --> 03:20.125
l want a full debrief, now.

[dogs barking]

03:31.077 --> 03:34.740
[dogs laughing]

03:35.915 --> 03:39.612
Nice work, rookie.
You found an exploding ham.

03:39.686 --> 03:41.711
Quiet, l smell a bomb.

03:41.788 --> 03:45.485
You! You should just
turn in your tags.

03:45.558 --> 03:49.153
[dogs continue laughing]

03:49.229 --> 03:51.197
<i>All right, I'll be
honest with you.</i>

03:51.264 --> 03:53.129
<i>I wasn't the best
dog on the force.</i>

03:53.199 --> 03:55.565
<i>In fact, I was
probably the worst.</i>

03:55.635 --> 03:58.297
<i>The ham was just
the latest of my mistakes.</i>

03:58.371 --> 04:01.534
<i>Like the time I chewed the extension
cord and it was plugged in.</i>

04:01.608 --> 04:03.769
<i>Or when I met that cute poodle</i>

04:03.843 --> 04:06.243
<i>and it turned out to be a guy.</i>

04:06.312 --> 04:09.975
<i>It's hard to feel destined for greatness
when you keep messing up.</i>

04:10.050 --> 04:12.075
<i>But, destiny's a funny thing.</i>

04:12.152 --> 04:14.916
<i>It'll creep up on you
when you least expect it.</i>

04:14.988 --> 04:17.478
Gotcha.
Last one for tonight.

04:17.557 --> 04:19.491
[dogs barking]

04:27.133 --> 04:29.863
Excuse me.
Uh, there's been a big mistake.

04:29.936 --> 04:32.905
l'm not a stray.
l shouldn't be in the pound.

04:32.972 --> 04:34.530
This ain't no pound, son.

04:34.607 --> 04:37.576
This place makes the pound
look like the dog park.

04:37.644 --> 04:40.579
By day it's OK, but at night,
once everyone's left,

04:40.647 --> 04:43.013
that's when the
freaky stuff happens.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.347
What kind of ''freaky stuff?''

04:45.418 --> 04:48.387
- What did they do to your hair?
- What's wrong with my hair?

04:48.455 --> 04:50.753
[stammers] Nothing. Nothing at all.

04:50.824 --> 04:53.691
You were saying about
the ''freaky stuff.''

04:53.760 --> 04:56.422
All l'm saying is when the guy
in the white lab coat

04:56.496 --> 04:58.259
pulls out the giant needle, run!

04:58.331 --> 05:00.231
[laughs maniacally]

[whistling]

05:08.741 --> 05:10.072
Hey.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.940
Welcome to the graveyard.

05:12.011 --> 05:14.775
Yeah, nice and quiet,
just like l like it.

05:14.848 --> 05:18.147
Uh, sir, excuse me.
We're not open right now.

05:18.218 --> 05:19.776
There's no access to the labs.

05:19.853 --> 05:22.981
Oh, really? l'm sorry.

05:23.056 --> 05:24.921
That's all right. Don't worry.

05:24.991 --> 05:27.926
Oh, wait. What's this?

05:28.728 --> 05:31.162
What does this say?

05:31.231 --> 05:35.258
Uh... ''All Access.'' Sorry.

05:36.503 --> 05:39.404
lt's OK. You all make mistakes.

05:39.472 --> 05:41.997
But l forgive you.

05:42.075 --> 05:45.101
Because that's the kind
of person l am... humble.

05:45.178 --> 05:47.840
A humble genius.

05:47.914 --> 05:49.541
[man] lt's OK.

05:50.750 --> 05:53.048
Let him in.

05:53.987 --> 05:55.284
Please.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.755
Again, l'm sorry, Dr. Barsinister.

05:57.824 --> 06:00.816
- l'm terribly sorry.
- lt's OK. How were you to know

06:00.894 --> 06:04.091
that l am the most important scientist
this company has?

06:05.465 --> 06:07.126
You couldn't have.

06:12.572 --> 06:12.705
[elevator bell dings]

06:12.705 --> 06:14.195
[elevator bell dings]

06:14.274 --> 06:17.710
- [Barsinister] Who's the new hire?
- Him? He, uh, used to be a cop.

06:17.777 --> 06:20.337
l was thinking that maybe
we should take it easy

06:20.413 --> 06:22.438
on the after-hours stuff.

06:22.515 --> 06:25.348
You know? Clandestine.

06:25.418 --> 06:28.945
A three-syllable word? l'm impressed.

06:29.022 --> 06:31.354
l bought a, uh...

06:33.193 --> 06:35.457
[mispronouncing] ...thesaurus.

06:35.528 --> 06:37.223
Good for you.

06:37.297 --> 06:40.664
But even if he is an ex-cop, we don't
have time to skulk about. Look.

06:41.734 --> 06:43.895
''Police Dog Training.''
lt's a great idea.

06:43.970 --> 06:45.403
Why didn't you think of that?

06:45.471 --> 06:49.168
Because training is a fool's process.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.971
l've met with the mayor,

06:51.044 --> 06:53.979
and l told him how we could
take this city to new heights

06:54.047 --> 06:56.811
through genetic manipulation.

06:56.883 --> 06:58.282
[meowing]

06:58.351 --> 07:02.549
- Yeah? What did he say?
- The fool actually laughed at me.

07:02.622 --> 07:05.250
That happened to me once.
l had my pants on inside out.

07:05.325 --> 07:08.317
Nobody told me for the entire day.

07:08.394 --> 07:10.555
- Stop talking now.
- Oh, right. Right.

07:10.630 --> 07:12.188
l'll be the silent partner.

07:12.265 --> 07:16.167
Just because you're the only one here,
Cad, does not make us partners.

07:17.403 --> 07:20.531
Wow. A real-life mad scientist.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.700
Yeah, and he ain't even mad yet.

07:22.775 --> 07:26.575
All right. Bring me the new dog.

07:29.449 --> 07:30.711
Your lucky day.

07:30.783 --> 07:34.150
[Barsinister] And now,
the most important DNA.

07:40.260 --> 07:42.125
- [whimpers]
- [Barsinister] Oh.

07:42.195 --> 07:44.060
Don't worry, little guy.

07:44.130 --> 07:48.066
lt will only hurt... a lot.

07:50.003 --> 07:52.096
OK, let's do it, partner.

[sneezes]

Gross! Your mouth was open!

[Cad] Hey, Doc! Get him!

08:37.082 --> 08:39.313
Get in the game, Doc.
He's right there.

08:41.520 --> 08:44.957
No, no! No, no!

08:45.024 --> 08:46.548
My research!

08:54.667 --> 08:58.831
- The serum.
- [Cad] He's going for the door!

09:01.874 --> 09:03.967
Run, boy. Run, run!

09:04.043 --> 09:06.375
Bring me a chew toy from the outside.

09:06.446 --> 09:07.674
And maybe some hair gel!

09:08.514 --> 09:10.482
[gasps] lt works.

- of Dr. Barsinister's research.
- Dan, we'll handle it from here.

09:27.433 --> 09:29.458
When there's a crime, they call a cop.

09:29.535 --> 09:32.527
When someone wants to
sign into the building, they call you.

09:32.605 --> 09:34.197
- [laughter]
- Right.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.600
That's why you're the chief.

[male dog] Hey, runt. You lost?

10:01.200 --> 10:03.361
- The name's Riff Raff.
- He's Riff Raff.

10:03.436 --> 10:06.030
- l've marked this territory.
- Yeah, he marked it.

10:06.105 --> 10:08.335
Look, l don't want any trouble, OK?

10:08.408 --> 10:10.808
Well, then today's your lucky day, mutt.

Sweet. We're going to get him.
Come back here!

No, too simplistic.

Come on, Jack. Dig deep.

Hey, Jack. Look.

- You bought a dog?
- No, l didn't buy him.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.912
l, uh, l found him on the street.

12:29.982 --> 12:32.280
He's cute, isn't he?

12:32.351 --> 12:35.809
l thought maybe we'd go for walks,
take him on a hike.

12:35.888 --> 12:37.549
Hikes? Oh, fun.

12:38.591 --> 12:43.995
Hey, look at that. l think
we should call him... Shoeshine.

12:44.063 --> 12:48.090
Considering all the other
things he probably licks,

12:48.167 --> 12:50.397

Jack, l just thought
he would be good for you.

Listen, l'm telling you
l am fine, all right?

12:58.311 --> 13:00.336
- OK.
- You don't have to keep doing this.

13:00.413 --> 13:04.406
You've got other things to worry about,
like being a prison guard to lab rats.

13:06.719 --> 13:11.281
You know what?
l like the new job.

13:12.658 --> 13:15.218

Keep an eye on him.

You know what?
Give him a chance.

13:43.055 --> 13:46.218
- You might even like him.
- l don't think so.

13:46.292 --> 13:49.386
All he does is eat, sleep and poop.

13:49.462 --> 13:51.828
Then the two of you
have a lot in common, don't you?

14:04.276 --> 14:08.269
<i>[Barsinister] I can isolate specific
protein strands in animal DNA.</i>

14:08.347 --> 14:12.147
<i>Then combine them any way I want.</i>

14:12.218 --> 14:15.016
<i>This will give him
the speed of a cheetah,</i>

14:15.087 --> 14:18.250
<i>the ability to fly like an eagle,</i>

14:18.324 --> 14:22.784
<i>or the strength of an animal
one hundred times his weight.</i>

14:24.030 --> 14:27.124
Forging a doctor's note, Jack?
ls this what it's come to?

14:27.199 --> 14:29.360
l didn't forge it.

14:29.435 --> 14:33.462
So, you expect me to believe
that you have... ''monkeypox?''

14:33.539 --> 14:36.372
[coughing] lt's pretty bad.

14:36.442 --> 14:38.501
OK.

14:38.577 --> 14:41.808
l don't know what disappoints me more,
the fact that you did it,

14:41.881 --> 14:46.079
or that you did so poorly that
you couldn't even fool a P.E. teacher.

14:48.621 --> 14:51.112
<i>Ahhh. Food.</i>

14:51.190 --> 14:53.021
[sniffing]

14:53.092 --> 14:55.151
<i>Yep. Definitely smell food.</i>

14:57.730 --> 14:59.129
<i>Hmm.</i>

15:00.766 --> 15:03.929
<i>It's not dog food, but it's about to be.</i>

15:09.742 --> 15:11.004
<i>Oh, no.</i>

15:11.077 --> 15:13.011
<i>They're going to blame this on me.</i>

15:13.079 --> 15:15.673
<i>Oh, well, bon appÃ©tit.</i>

15:18.284 --> 15:21.742
<i>A-ha. Homo postalis,
the Great North American Mailman.</i>

15:21.821 --> 15:23.812
<i>Natural enemy of the dog.</i>

15:23.889 --> 15:27.347
- [barking]
- Look, the Ungers got a new cat.

15:28.494 --> 15:31.361
Come on. Come on, come on.

15:31.430 --> 15:34.399
ls that the best you got?
You want a piece of this here?

15:38.070 --> 15:39.059
<i>Whoa.</i>

15:40.172 --> 15:41.264
<i>[laughing]</i>

15:41.340 --> 15:43.604
<i>That's right. Run, mail-slinger, run.</i>

15:43.676 --> 15:46.941
<i>And never come back here again.</i>

15:47.012 --> 15:48.775
- [tires screech]
- [cat screeches]

15:48.848 --> 15:50.213
<i>Great. Two for one.</i>

15:50.282 --> 15:52.341
<i>Hey. Is that a tennis ball?</i>

15:52.418 --> 15:55.444
<i>[chuckles] This day just
gets better and better.</i>

15:56.422 --> 15:57.912
<i>[grunts] Whoa!</i>

16:03.629 --> 16:05.620
<i>[pants] That couch tried to kill me.</i>

16:05.698 --> 16:08.792
<i>There is something
mighty peculiar going on here.</i>

16:08.868 --> 16:10.335
<i>- [door opening]
- Huh?</i>

16:19.879 --> 16:24.441
- What did you do?
- [whimpering]

16:26.051 --> 16:29.248
Dad is going to kill you.
And then me.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.150
Oh!

16:32.224 --> 16:33.953
l really hope this is chili.

16:34.026 --> 16:36.620
Give me a break.
lt was an accident.

16:45.237 --> 16:47.467
[Jack] Hello?

16:47.540 --> 16:51.101
Dad? ls that you?

16:51.177 --> 16:53.042
Hello?

16:58.651 --> 17:00.346
Come here, boy.

17:04.223 --> 17:06.623
- Did you hear something?
- No. Did you?

17:11.262 --> 17:14.391
- Did you just talk?
- Huh? What? Hmm?

17:16.101 --> 17:18.968
Whoa, whoa... Wait a minute.
You can understand me?

17:21.272 --> 17:25.403
[both screaming]

17:27.546 --> 17:30.208
[hyperventilating]

17:30.282 --> 17:32.079
OK. OK. Deep breaths.

17:32.151 --> 17:35.382
Get some fresh air to the brain.
You're just imagining this.

17:35.454 --> 17:38.480
- Wait. You...
- Bad dog. Stop talking.

17:38.557 --> 17:40.616
Wait. Stop.

17:40.693 --> 17:43.161
Person, heel.
Come on, who trained you?

17:43.229 --> 17:45.754
Person, just wait.

17:45.831 --> 17:50.530
- What did you just call me?
- Sorry. l don't know your name.

17:50.603 --> 17:53.163
Jack. Nothing. Stop talking to me.

17:53.239 --> 17:55.730
Look, l can't stop talking to you,
Jack Nothing,

17:55.808 --> 17:57.435
because l'm freaking out here.

17:59.745 --> 18:02.908
lf we're going for a walk,
you may want to get a poop bag.

18:02.982 --> 18:06.679
- What?
- l have that special feeling.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.242
Maybe you're the problem.

18:08.320 --> 18:10.584
A weirdo kid who can
suddenly talk to dogs.

18:10.656 --> 18:12.715
How did you learn to speak English?

18:12.791 --> 18:15.885
- How should l know?
- Can you speak other languages?

18:15.961 --> 18:19.727
A little retriever. Some shih tzu.
My Chihuahua is a little rusty, though.

18:19.798 --> 18:24.201
- OK, l mean other human languages.
- So English isn't enough for you?

18:25.804 --> 18:27.237
Jack?

18:27.806 --> 18:31.640
Shh! That's Molly,
a reporter for the school paper.

18:31.710 --> 18:35.077
She'll have a field day with you.
Just speak dog.

18:35.147 --> 18:36.478
Arf. Arf.

18:37.917 --> 18:39.680
- Hey, how's it going?
- Good.

18:39.752 --> 18:43.552
- Were you just talking to someone?
- Just my dog.

18:45.524 --> 18:47.890
l've got my dog, too. Polly!

18:47.960 --> 18:49.393
<i>[# Styx: Lady]</i>

19:03.275 --> 19:05.243
OK, here we go.

19:05.311 --> 19:08.838
Uh, hello. l'm Shoeshine.

19:08.914 --> 19:11.144
Oh, well, hello. l'm Polly.

19:11.216 --> 19:12.945
- [barking]
- [laughing]

19:14.853 --> 19:17.413
l think she likes him.

19:17.489 --> 19:19.787
l've never seen you.
Are you new to this park?

19:19.858 --> 19:22.520
Oh, yeah, l just, uh, relocated.

19:22.594 --> 19:26.496
You smell wonderful.
Like a half-eaten pig's ear.

19:26.565 --> 19:29.090
Excuse me. ''Pig's ear?''

19:29.168 --> 19:31.136
ls that what passes for a pick-up line?

19:31.203 --> 19:32.966
No, no. l, uh...

19:33.038 --> 19:35.905
Well, l've got to get going.
Come on, Polly.

19:35.975 --> 19:40.105
- Master calls.
- So, uh, will l see you again?

19:40.179 --> 19:41.976
Look, you're a cute beagle and all,

19:42.047 --> 19:44.413
but l want a little pizzazz
in a relationship.

19:44.483 --> 19:46.849
A guy who can sweep me
off my feet, you know?

19:46.919 --> 19:50.252
- Hmm...
- But we can be friends, OK?

19:50.322 --> 19:52.847
- See you later.
- Yeah. See you later.

19:54.426 --> 19:58.920
''Friends?'' ''Friends?''
l don't want to be friends.

19:58.998 --> 20:01.592
l'm looking to settle down,
to find Mrs. Right.

20:01.667 --> 20:03.862
She could be Polly Shoeshine.

20:03.936 --> 20:06.268
Or is it Polly Shine? Or is it...

20:06.338 --> 20:08.568
Hey, Frisbee!

20:14.847 --> 20:17.407
- What was that?
- lt's my instincts.

20:17.483 --> 20:18.950
l just can't help myself.

20:19.018 --> 20:21.213
Whoo! What a rush.

20:21.286 --> 20:23.550
OK. What else do you do?

20:23.622 --> 20:26.955
Now bury the bone. Let's go.
Good boy. Bury the bone.

20:27.026 --> 20:30.723
Uh, excuse me. You want to tell me
why you're talking to me like that?

20:30.796 --> 20:33.492
What? lt's doggy talk.

20:33.565 --> 20:36.295
Well, it's demeaning.
Give me the stick.

20:49.081 --> 20:53.415
- Hey, l think l struck oil.
- Shoeshine, get out of there. Come on.

20:56.855 --> 20:58.447
l hope no one saw that.

21:00.559 --> 21:03.392
What else do dogs do?
Hey, they smell.

21:03.462 --> 21:05.953
- How's your smelling?
- My schnoz ain't too good.

21:06.031 --> 21:08.090
Got me fired from my last job.

21:08.167 --> 21:10.431
That's ridiculous.
Come on, just try it.

21:10.502 --> 21:12.333
Smelling makes me nervous, and l...

21:12.404 --> 21:15.271
Ah... ah... ah-choo!

21:20.813 --> 21:23.077
Glad l didn't try
to hold that one in.

21:23.148 --> 21:25.275
l would have blown my brains
out of my ears.

21:25.350 --> 21:27.375
OK. Um, what are they saying?

21:29.121 --> 21:31.248
[indistinct voices becoming clearer]

21:31.323 --> 21:34.622
[girl] ...when l talk like that.
l'm not gonna spend...

21:34.693 --> 21:36.217
l know. We'll talk later. Bye.

21:37.696 --> 21:39.891
Catch the ball
right in the web of the glove.

21:41.633 --> 21:43.362
Maybe we should see other people.

21:43.435 --> 21:47.269
He thinks it would be better
if they saw other people.

21:47.339 --> 21:49.830
She says for all she cares
he can go eat...

21:49.908 --> 21:52.274
- People eat that, too?
- [chuckles]

21:54.480 --> 21:56.380
[crying] Help! Let me go.

21:56.448 --> 21:59.417
lt's Polly and that girl
who follows her around.

21:59.485 --> 22:01.749
- Molly.
- She's with two other guys.

22:01.820 --> 22:04.118
They're stealing
her backpack. This way.

22:04.189 --> 22:05.816
Hey! Wait.

22:05.891 --> 22:09.418
- Slow down.
- No, you speed up. Use all four legs.

22:09.495 --> 22:11.622
- [tires screeching]
- [horns honking]

22:13.332 --> 22:16.096
This is incredible.
l've never run this fast before.

22:16.168 --> 22:19.899
lt feels like my feet aren't
even touching the ground...

22:19.972 --> 22:23.567
- Yeow!
- [horns honking]

22:23.642 --> 22:25.109
Whoo!

22:26.078 --> 22:28.239
[gasps] l can fly?

22:28.313 --> 22:29.302
Hey!

22:34.820 --> 22:36.845
Whoa! Look out!

22:36.922 --> 22:38.981
Whoo!

22:41.493 --> 22:44.792
This is way better than
sticking your head out of a moving car.

22:44.863 --> 22:47.661
- Whoo hoo!
- [truck horn honking]

22:56.241 --> 23:00.610
Oh, no! l'm blind.
l can't see. Oh, no.

23:00.679 --> 23:02.442
l don't want to see.

23:02.514 --> 23:04.345
Sorry.

23:04.416 --> 23:06.884
Excuse me. Pardon me.

23:06.952 --> 23:08.351
Excuse me. Out of the way.

23:10.756 --> 23:12.883
l'm good. l'm good.

23:12.958 --> 23:14.118
Whoo!

23:15.227 --> 23:17.058
[groans] Spicy mustard.

23:17.129 --> 23:19.359
Ow! Where are the brakes on this thing?

23:19.431 --> 23:21.399
- l got a camera.
- Hurry up.

23:21.466 --> 23:23.058
Whoo!

23:26.605 --> 23:28.266
Whoa!

23:30.309 --> 23:31.435
Ahhh!

24:06.011 --> 24:08.172

24:08.247 --> 24:10.477
[murmuring]

24:17.356 --> 24:20.814
Uh-huh. Someone just
swooped in and saved you?

24:20.892 --> 24:23.326
You think you could describe him?

24:23.395 --> 24:26.057
Yes. He was white.

24:29.768 --> 24:33.704
- Molly, hey. Um, are you all right?
- Mm-hmm.

24:33.772 --> 24:37.367
- OK, so he's a Caucasian?
- Actually, l think he was brown.

24:37.442 --> 24:40.969
He was light brown with white spots
on his belly, paws and tail.

24:41.046 --> 24:44.311
He had black whiskers,
brown eyes and a wet nose.

24:44.383 --> 24:46.180
Like this?

24:49.721 --> 24:49.821
[Jack] Shoeshine? Shoeshine.

24:49.821 --> 24:52.289
[Jack] Shoeshine? Shoeshine.

24:52.357 --> 24:56.487
- Shoeshine, you here?
- [whimpering]

24:59.131 --> 25:01.292
Sorry, Jack.

25:01.366 --> 25:03.425
l didn't mean to break those cars

25:03.502 --> 25:06.300
or those garbage cans or that building.

25:06.371 --> 25:08.236
Shoeshine, you're a hero.

25:08.307 --> 25:10.673
No, l don't want to be a hero.
l'll screw it up.

25:10.742 --> 25:13.643
Trust me on this one.

25:15.247 --> 25:19.877
[sighs] l just wanted a home,
a place where l belonged.

25:19.951 --> 25:23.250
Just because l have these powers
doesn't make me a hero.

25:23.322 --> 25:26.985
Shoeshine, it depends
on what you do with them.

25:27.059 --> 25:30.893
Maybe. But promise me,
no one can find out.

25:30.962 --> 25:33.829
- Not even your dad.
- Oh, my dad.

25:33.899 --> 25:36.060
Easy. Easy.

25:36.134 --> 25:37.863
Do you see a tennis ball anywhere?

25:37.936 --> 25:39.699
[doorbell rings]

25:39.771 --> 25:41.705
Just put it in the corner.

25:41.773 --> 25:44.708
You know, traditionally,
the dog makes the mess

25:44.776 --> 25:46.767
and the human cleans it up.

25:48.914 --> 25:52.247
l'm looking for my beagle.
He, uh, does tricks and stuff.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.654
l'm... l'm sorry. l haven't seen him.

25:56.722 --> 25:58.986
[crashing]

26:02.594 --> 26:06.428
- What was that?
- That was my, um... my grandpa.

26:06.498 --> 26:10.798
He's blind, and we're just
rearranging the furniture.

26:10.869 --> 26:14.134
- Are you all right in there, Gramps?
- Who you calling Gramps?

26:14.206 --> 26:16.333
Get back in here
and help me move the couch.

26:18.076 --> 26:19.839
[crashing]

26:25.484 --> 26:28.715
You're making your blind
grandfather move a couch?

26:28.787 --> 26:32.086
lt was either that
or repave the driveway. His choice.

26:32.157 --> 26:33.624
Good luck finding your dog.

26:38.263 --> 26:41.630
- Do you belong to that guy?
- What? Me? No.

26:42.901 --> 26:44.732
- Then who was he?
- How should l know?

26:44.803 --> 26:46.464
All you humans look alike.

26:49.307 --> 26:50.934
Oh, it's my dad.

26:51.009 --> 26:53.569
OK. l'm going to go
out there and stall him,

26:53.645 --> 26:56.876
and you try and make things
look as normal as possible in here.

26:56.948 --> 26:59.883
Talking dog will try
to make things normal. Check.

27:07.259 --> 27:09.056
[sighs] All clean.

27:09.127 --> 27:12.426
- Dad, Dad, hey.
- Hey, how are you? What's up?

27:12.497 --> 27:17.025
- Do you need help?
- Sure, yeah. Thanks.

27:17.102 --> 27:19.866
Wait. l'm going to put these inside,

27:19.938 --> 27:22.065
and then we're going to go for a walk.

27:22.140 --> 27:24.199
A walk?

27:24.276 --> 27:26.403
You and me are going to go for a walk?

27:26.478 --> 27:29.879
Yeah. You know, just chill, talk?

27:29.948 --> 27:31.279
Hang out?

27:33.285 --> 27:34.274
OK. Come on.

27:38.223 --> 27:40.214
What happened there?

27:41.793 --> 27:44.125
- [Jack] Dad, wait.
- [Dan] No, Jack.

27:45.730 --> 27:48.130
- What?
- [glass breaking]

27:54.806 --> 27:57.673
Yeah, hang out.

27:57.742 --> 28:00.973
- Dad, look, l can explain.
- Don't tell me the dog did it.

28:02.214 --> 28:03.772
We'll talk about it later.

28:03.849 --> 28:05.817
l'm going to take that dog to the pound.

28:05.884 --> 28:10.014
Dad, no! No, please.
l want to keep him.

28:10.088 --> 28:11.988
You told me you didn't want the dog.

28:12.057 --> 28:13.354
Me? No way.

28:13.425 --> 28:16.189
l told you l've wanted a dog
since l was, like, eight.

28:19.030 --> 28:20.793
[whimpering]

28:26.905 --> 28:30.864
All right, but it's your responsibility.

28:30.942 --> 28:33.934
You got to feed it, brush it, walk it.
You got to train it.

28:34.012 --> 28:37.504
Trust me, Dad. This dog will do things
that will blow your mind.

28:43.989 --> 28:46.890
- [Dan] This better be chili.
- [growls]

28:49.528 --> 28:51.519

28:54.633 --> 28:58.364
[Barsinister] Yes. Yes, brilliant.

29:02.908 --> 29:07.038
Already the flames of inspiration

29:07.112 --> 29:10.047
are licking at my brain.

29:11.182 --> 29:12.342
Unencumbered,

29:12.417 --> 29:17.514
in this, my new laboratory.

29:18.523 --> 29:22.459
- Kind of smells like a men's room.
- So much the better.

29:22.527 --> 29:25.360
lt seems like the wrong vibe
for our work.

29:25.430 --> 29:27.455
Seems a little precocious.

29:27.532 --> 29:31.093
- Perspicacious.
- What?

29:31.169 --> 29:33.865
Peppery? Prim?

29:33.939 --> 29:38.569
Most of my thesaurus
burned up in the fire.

29:38.643 --> 29:40.611
All l've got left are the P's.

29:40.679 --> 29:45.139
- Perfect.
- Ooh. That's a good one.

29:45.216 --> 29:46.740
Can l use that?

29:46.818 --> 29:51.152
The material l require
is going to be expensive.

29:51.222 --> 29:56.717
We're going to need to find ways
to subsidize my work.

29:56.795 --> 30:00.424
l know some guys who just
got out of the clink who can help us.

30:03.168 --> 30:05.363
Perhaps. Bam!

30:05.437 --> 30:08.531
- Ahhh!
- Nailed it.

30:08.640 --> 30:11.131
<i>Jack and I became good buddies.</i>

30:11.209 --> 30:15.077
<i>For the first time in my life,
I really felt like Man's Best Friend.</i>

30:15.146 --> 30:18.081
[man] Hot dogs, nice and hot!

30:18.149 --> 30:20.117
Come on.
Bite into a nice juicy hot dog.

30:20.185 --> 30:21.982
What? What?

30:23.688 --> 30:25.986
Oh, my gosh, they're made of dog!

30:26.057 --> 30:27.786
Are you people crazy?

30:29.060 --> 30:30.584
Shoeshine, come here.

30:30.662 --> 30:33.187
lt's not real dog.

30:33.264 --> 30:35.858
- What is it then?
- lt's just animal parts.

30:35.934 --> 30:38.300
You know, like noses,
hooves, intestines.

30:38.370 --> 30:40.361
Well, in that case, l'll take two.

30:40.438 --> 30:43.498
Hot dogs! Hot dogs!
That's what l got!

30:43.575 --> 30:47.136
Hot dogs! Hot dogs!
Nice and hot!

30:47.212 --> 30:50.181
- Why is he talking like that?
- He's rhyming.

30:50.248 --> 30:53.809
lt's a gimmick.
To get people's attention.

30:53.885 --> 30:57.013
That seems like a strange convention
for you to mention.

30:59.257 --> 31:02.420
And this is where l'm bored
out of my mind, eight hours a day.

31:02.494 --> 31:05.190
Whenever l'm bored
l just chase my tail.

31:05.263 --> 31:07.231
lf you're lucky
you throw up and bingo!

31:07.298 --> 31:08.526
Lunch, part two.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.864
- Nice.
- What?

31:12.737 --> 31:15.797
Sticks, balls, and running in one game?

31:15.874 --> 31:19.002
- So clever. So inspired.
- Not our team.

31:19.077 --> 31:21.272
We're always the underdogs.

31:21.346 --> 31:24.713
Never heard of that breed.
ls that a dog from Australia?

31:24.783 --> 31:26.512
No. Look,

31:26.584 --> 31:29.519
an underdog is someone
who has been counted out

31:29.587 --> 31:32.147
and nobody expects them to win.

31:32.223 --> 31:35.989
- Yeah, l know the feeling. Huh?
- [cat meows]

31:36.061 --> 31:38.962
[Shoeshine] There goes the neighborhood.

31:39.030 --> 31:41.157
- Shoeshine, no.
- [groans]

31:43.034 --> 31:45.127
- Freak.
- What?

31:45.203 --> 31:47.034
See?

31:50.241 --> 31:54.337
- So, what's the score?
- l told you no.

31:54.412 --> 31:57.176
But every molecule of me
was screaming ''yes.''

31:57.248 --> 31:59.239
lt's time to teach you some manners.

31:59.317 --> 32:01.148
Right. l'm going to learn manners

32:01.219 --> 32:04.017
from a guy who pees
in my white porcelain drinking bowl.

32:04.089 --> 32:08.321
All right. Basic commands.
Chapter one: sit.

32:08.393 --> 32:09.951
Let's start with a tough one.

32:10.028 --> 32:12.189
- Chapter two: lie down.
- Fine.

32:12.263 --> 32:13.696
l was going to do that anyway.

32:13.765 --> 32:16.427
Chapter three: roll over.

32:16.501 --> 32:19.095
This book doesn't have
much of a plot, does it?

32:19.170 --> 32:21.695
And chapter four: speak.

32:21.773 --> 32:25.732
Arf. Arf.
You can't be serious with this.

32:25.810 --> 32:28.278
Four weeks of lessons
in four seconds?

32:28.346 --> 32:30.246
We're on a good pace.

32:30.315 --> 32:33.375
Chapter five:
return the book and get your money back.

32:35.854 --> 32:40.257
- l got you something.
- Oh. Never had one of these before.

32:40.325 --> 32:44.261
lf you ever get lost
they'll know where to bring you home.

32:44.329 --> 32:45.728
''Home.''

32:45.797 --> 32:47.958
Wow, this is great!

32:48.032 --> 32:51.399
Oh, ew! Oh, that breath is horrible.

32:51.469 --> 32:52.868
What have you been eating?

32:52.937 --> 32:56.236
Not sure. l dug it out
from under the house.

32:57.509 --> 32:59.500
<i>Suddenly I had a home and a family.</i>

32:59.577 --> 33:01.340

33:01.412 --> 33:03.437

33:07.118 --> 33:08.915
<i>Well, guess what?</i>

33:13.124 --> 33:17.060
Oh, the price l've paid.

33:17.128 --> 33:19.358
[sighs] So be it.

33:23.968 --> 33:25.731
Hi. How's it going?

33:25.804 --> 33:29.171
l'd love to, baby, but l'm busy.

33:29.240 --> 33:32.607
Work out? Yeah, l work out.

33:32.677 --> 33:35.168
l think of my body as a Buddhist temple.

33:35.246 --> 33:39.512

Why settle for just one

34:31.735 --> 34:35.672
That's a ''P'' word.
l bet l have that one.

34:35.739 --> 34:38.504
Just pick it up, you ape.

He was twice decorated

- What happened?

35:29.494 --> 35:30.722
He quit.

- That a big deal?
- A big deal?

35:34.999 --> 35:36.557
Yeah.

OK, he says he quit his job

What do l do if your dad's
around and l got to...

40:50.982 --> 40:53.109
...you know, take off?

40:53.184 --> 40:55.175
Bark three times. Yeah, OK.

40:55.253 --> 40:58.120
That's going to be our code.
You have to bark three times.

40:58.189 --> 41:01.989
Hang on. Do l bark three times
or say the word ''bark'' three times?

41:03.427 --> 41:05.793
- Right. Dog bark. Got it.
- [buzzing]

41:07.331 --> 41:10.994
You know, l think
that was ''dry clean only.''

41:12.536 --> 41:14.436
Ow! Watch the ears.

41:14.505 --> 41:17.804
- [straining]
- lt's perfect.

41:17.875 --> 41:21.242
We're still gonna need something
else to get people's attention.

41:21.312 --> 41:24.372
You're right. A flying dog
in a red sweater isn't enough.

41:24.448 --> 41:26.177
You know, like a catch phrase.

41:26.250 --> 41:28.775
Like, ''Up, up and away''

41:28.853 --> 41:32.016
or ''lt's clobbering time.''

41:38.329 --> 41:40.957
<i>[police dispatcher]
Attention, all patrol units.</i>

41:41.032 --> 41:44.490
<i>We're still looking for a cat burglar
last seen on Eighth Avenue.</i>

41:44.568 --> 41:46.832
[panting]

41:53.311 --> 41:56.803
- So, you're a cat burglar, huh?
- Huh?

41:56.881 --> 42:00.612
Well, l'm not really a cat person. Woof.

42:04.221 --> 42:08.453
There's no need to worry.
Underdog is furry.

42:09.493 --> 42:11.461
No, that's not it.

42:11.529 --> 42:13.360
<i>[# Plain White T's:

42:15.499 --> 42:18.662
Police stations have been
flooded with eyewitnesses reporting

42:18.736 --> 42:20.795
miraculous feats by this phenomenon

42:20.871 --> 42:23.601
who goes by the name Underdog. Whoa!

42:25.276 --> 42:28.439
There's no need for fright.
Underdog's got bite.

42:28.512 --> 42:29.740
That's not it either.

42:36.020 --> 42:38.079
[tires screeching]

42:47.231 --> 42:49.062
[tires screeching]

42:49.133 --> 42:51.397
Now that dude knows
how to chase a car.

42:54.438 --> 42:57.635
[man] Ready. Set. Go!

43:01.912 --> 43:03.038
[burping]

43:03.114 --> 43:04.843
Excuse me. Are you gonna eat that?

43:04.915 --> 43:07.577
l wanted to have Underdog
on the show tonight,

43:07.651 --> 43:10.279
but he's not allowed on the couch.
That's a problem.

43:10.354 --> 43:11.412
[laughter]

43:19.096 --> 43:20.358
Ooh.

43:21.632 --> 43:23.600
Man, that kung pao chicken was good.

43:39.884 --> 43:41.784
[meowing]

43:44.188 --> 43:48.124
Don't tell your cat buddies about this
because l have a reputation to uphold.

43:48.192 --> 43:51.286
- Freak.
- Yup, l thought that was you.

43:51.362 --> 43:55.765
There's no need to fear.
Underdog is here.

43:55.833 --> 43:58.461
Hey, that's pretty good.
l think l'll keep that one.

43:59.103 --> 44:00.263
By executive order,

44:00.337 --> 44:03.932
l proclaim today
''Underdog Day'' in Capitol City.

44:04.008 --> 44:06.875
l would also like to invite
Underdog down to the capitol,

44:06.944 --> 44:09.708
provided he's housebroken, that is.

44:15.252 --> 44:18.449
Speak. Speak.

44:19.323 --> 44:21.223
What do you want me to say?

44:21.292 --> 44:23.692
Not you.

44:25.162 --> 44:27.790
Come on. Come on.
l know you can do it.

44:27.865 --> 44:30.663
- [barks]
- English.

44:30.734 --> 44:32.133
- [slurps]
- [groans]

44:32.203 --> 44:35.536
- [whimpers]
- Get rid of him.

44:39.577 --> 44:41.067
[Barsinister groaning]

44:41.145 --> 44:44.979
That should be me on the front page,

44:45.049 --> 44:48.280
not that stupid mutt.

44:52.623 --> 44:55.387
l need a sample of his DNA.

45:01.165 --> 45:04.532
How do you look in a dress?

45:04.602 --> 45:06.900
[in high-pitched voice]
Somebody, help me!

45:06.971 --> 45:08.029
[whimpering]

45:08.105 --> 45:09.970
- [man] Hey.
- [woman] Oh, my gosh.

45:10.040 --> 45:12.770
- [man] What's going on there?
- [crowd murmuring]

45:12.843 --> 45:17.041
Help me! Help me!
l'm a clumsy old woman!

45:17.114 --> 45:18.775
l thought my window was a door!

45:18.849 --> 45:21.044
There's no need to fear.

45:21.118 --> 45:24.679
Underdog is... moving too fast.

45:24.755 --> 45:26.723
- [screaming]
- [crowd screaming]

45:26.790 --> 45:29.224
l seriously need to work on my landing.

45:29.927 --> 45:31.986
[screaming]

45:32.062 --> 45:34.826
When old ladies
are falling, l'm not slow.

45:34.899 --> 45:37.561
lt's hip-hip-hip, and away l go.

45:37.635 --> 45:39.364
[relieved voices]

45:40.404 --> 45:42.838
[man] Way to go, Underdog!

45:44.608 --> 45:45.870
You're safe now, ma'am.

45:45.943 --> 45:48.969
And, in the future,
try to stay away from open windows.

45:49.046 --> 45:53.642
Lovely pup. l'm so grateful.
A little treat for you.

45:53.717 --> 45:56.049
Yes. lt's called a choke chain.

45:58.122 --> 46:00.352
What's the matter, doggy? Can't breathe?

46:00.424 --> 46:02.949
- Hey, it's you.
- Let's go.

46:03.027 --> 46:06.019
<i>As soon as I knew it was Cad,
I took him for a walk.</i>

46:06.096 --> 46:07.461
Whoa!

46:07.531 --> 46:08.964
Ohhh!

46:11.068 --> 46:13.662
Burns! My parts! Heel, dog!

46:13.737 --> 46:16.763
Please heel! Burns!

46:40.731 --> 46:44.326
You slack-jawed,
mouth-breathing imbecile!

46:44.401 --> 46:47.268
l should have put strychnine

46:47.338 --> 46:51.434
in your chocolate milk months ago.

46:51.508 --> 46:56.445
Give me one good reason why
l shouldn't dispose of you right now!

46:59.383 --> 47:03.547
Well, uh... l got this.

47:07.725 --> 47:11.354
<i>My first collar ever,
and I lose it to some guy in a dress.</i>

47:11.428 --> 47:13.862
<i>I sat there hoping
Jack wouldn't ask about it.</i>

47:13.931 --> 47:15.262
Where's your collar?

47:15.332 --> 47:17.323
- My collar?
- Yeah.

47:17.401 --> 47:20.336
Oh, um, it must have fallen off.

47:20.404 --> 47:22.429
Kicking butt and taking names, huh?

47:22.506 --> 47:24.633
No, just barking
at myself in the mirror.

47:24.708 --> 47:26.471
l'll tell you, it never gets old.

47:26.543 --> 47:29.103
We're gonna go meet
Molly and Polly at the library.

47:29.179 --> 47:30.646
Cool. A double date.

47:30.714 --> 47:34.115
- lt's not exactly a date.
- Whatever.

47:34.184 --> 47:37.244
But when l give you ''the look,''
make yourself scarce

47:37.321 --> 47:39.016
so l can make my move.

47:39.089 --> 47:41.523
Your move?
You have a move?

47:41.592 --> 47:43.787
l use my paws and
drag my butt on the ground.

47:43.861 --> 47:47.092
- Chicks dig that.
- OK.

47:47.164 --> 47:49.098
Hey, nice beagle.

47:49.166 --> 47:52.294
- Just like Underdog, huh?
- Underdog? Him?

47:52.369 --> 47:56.100
No, no. Only thing
strong about this dog is his breath.

47:56.173 --> 47:59.836
- Hmm?
- Sure looks like Underdog.

47:59.910 --> 48:01.343
- Hey.
- Sorry.

48:01.412 --> 48:02.970
We need to work on your identity.

48:03.047 --> 48:06.107
OK, as long as l don't look ridiculous.

48:06.183 --> 48:08.549
l look ridiculous.

48:08.619 --> 48:11.679
lt makes you look taller.
That's a good thing.

48:11.755 --> 48:14.383
Hey, speed bump. You survived.

48:14.458 --> 48:17.791
Let me guess.
You went for satellite instead of cable.

48:17.861 --> 48:20.796
- [dogs laughing]
- Put a muzzle on it.

48:20.864 --> 48:22.092
What's the matter, runt?

48:22.166 --> 48:24.532
You let your girlfriend
do the talking for you?

48:24.601 --> 48:26.535
Maybe you can't hear me.

48:26.603 --> 48:28.833
- [barking]
- [whimpering]

48:28.906 --> 48:33.070
So, if you ever want
to be with a real dog, give me a sniff.

48:33.143 --> 48:35.577
- You're a real player, boss.
- Let's go, fellas.

48:35.646 --> 48:38.843
- We showed him, huh, boss?
- What do you mean, ''we?''

48:38.916 --> 48:42.647
Shoeshine, come on.
You got to stand up for yourself.

48:42.720 --> 48:45.780
Would Underdog have backed down
from that mongrel?

48:45.856 --> 48:49.849
Underdog.
Oh, the way his ears flop when he flies,

48:49.927 --> 48:52.293
that shimmering coat.

48:52.362 --> 48:54.728
Could you imagine me

48:54.798 --> 48:58.097
- off leash with Underdog?
- Hmm.

48:58.168 --> 49:00.568
There isn't a hose cold enough
to break that up.

49:00.637 --> 49:03.401
l wish l could meet him.

49:03.474 --> 49:06.773
Well, you know, they say
he answers every call for help.

49:06.844 --> 49:09.039
Really?

49:11.115 --> 49:14.107
[Polly] Help. Oh, help.

49:14.184 --> 49:16.311
Help, help.

49:16.386 --> 49:18.513
Help! Hello?

49:18.589 --> 49:20.557
Oh, my.

49:20.624 --> 49:23.593
Where, oh, where can my Underdog be?

49:23.660 --> 49:27.096
- Did somebody order a hero?
- [crashing]

49:28.365 --> 49:30.925
[grunting] Ow!

49:31.001 --> 49:34.095
- [groaning]
- Underdog!

49:36.507 --> 49:38.407
Why, oh, why have you
called for help?

49:38.475 --> 49:41.273
l was flying by when l heard you yelp.

49:41.345 --> 49:42.778
Oh. Um...

49:42.846 --> 49:44.711
''Help.'' Right.

49:44.782 --> 49:46.977
l'm... l'm out of food.

49:47.050 --> 49:49.211
Your bowl is empty, that is true.

49:49.286 --> 49:51.413
Might l have a date with you?

49:51.488 --> 49:54.787
Excuse me.
Do you only speak in rhyme?

49:54.858 --> 49:58.954
My rhymes are merely said
in fun. OK, l'm done.

49:59.029 --> 50:00.428
[sighs] Good.

50:00.497 --> 50:05.560
- lt's beautiful, isn't it?
- Yes, you are.

50:05.636 --> 50:08.400
Uh... you are right about that.

50:08.472 --> 50:13.341
Moon? Stars? The yard?
Sorry, what were we looking at again?

50:13.410 --> 50:16.777
lt must be so amazing to be you,

50:16.847 --> 50:20.180
to be able to go where you want,
whenever you want.

50:20.250 --> 50:24.653
l have to always ''sit,''
''stay,'' ''be a good dog.''

50:24.721 --> 50:26.951
Well, then, let's be bad dogs.

50:29.393 --> 50:32.760
- OK. You ready?
- Ready for what?

50:32.830 --> 50:35.526
- [screaming]
- Don't worry. l got you.

50:37.601 --> 50:39.728
- You OK?
- Yes.

50:39.803 --> 50:43.864
Oh, l love the feeling
of the wind in my fur.

50:43.941 --> 50:45.875
Yeah, l thought you might.

50:45.943 --> 50:49.470
l call it extreme off-leash.

50:51.048 --> 50:55.280
Have you worked up an appetite?
Let's see. What's for dinner?

50:55.352 --> 50:56.649
Oh, look. ltalian.

50:59.289 --> 51:02.190
- OK, hang on!
- Careful!

51:02.259 --> 51:04.420
[gasps] My doggy bag.

51:11.935 --> 51:16.099
Here we go. The perfect spot
for dinner on the fly.

51:17.941 --> 51:21.001
There's only one meatball.
Why don't you have it.

51:21.078 --> 51:23.546
Oh, no, thanks. l'm on a diet.

51:24.381 --> 51:25.848
No, l insist.

51:28.252 --> 51:30.686
- Uh-oh.
- [meatball splats]

51:30.754 --> 51:32.415
[meowing]

51:33.590 --> 51:36.582
[Dan] The sewers lead
into this drainage into the complex.

51:36.660 --> 51:38.992
lf you have access
to any of the sewer systems,

51:39.062 --> 51:41.030
you can get anywhere in the city.

51:41.098 --> 51:43.896
Even Dr. Barsinister knows that.

51:43.967 --> 51:46.265
[humming]

51:50.841 --> 51:53.173
Oh, hey, Jack. How's it going?

51:53.243 --> 51:56.041
- Where have you been all night?
- l don't sniff and tell.

51:56.947 --> 51:59.381
- Hey, Shoeshine.
- Woof! Woof!

52:00.751 --> 52:03.242
Hey, um, we're going to
head to the park.

52:03.320 --> 52:05.447
You know,
teach some tricks, do training.

52:05.522 --> 52:07.114
Cool. Mind if l come?

52:07.190 --> 52:10.591
Um, you know,
it's probably better if we went alone,

52:10.661 --> 52:14.825
because it's good
for his concentration.

52:15.999 --> 52:17.330
Son.

52:18.435 --> 52:20.596
You know, we got to try here.

52:20.671 --> 52:22.935
l got to go.

52:23.941 --> 52:26.034
[door opens and shuts]

52:26.109 --> 52:28.805
You know, Jack,
that was really nice of your dad.

52:28.879 --> 52:31.109
- Why did you blow him off like that?
- What?

52:31.181 --> 52:34.116
Your dad is reaching out to you,
and you keep pushing him away.

52:34.184 --> 52:38.177
- l've been pushing everyone away.
- Maybe it's time to stop.

52:42.192 --> 52:44.683
You're right. l should
talk to him about it.

52:46.396 --> 52:48.057
How did you get so smart, anyway?

52:48.131 --> 52:50.827
Genetic engineering.
You should try it.

52:52.936 --> 52:56.929
Oh, look! Dad is home.

52:57.007 --> 53:00.170
- Where's Jack?
- Don't worry.

53:01.311 --> 53:04.712
We haven't done anything to him... yet.

53:08.652 --> 53:10.085
- Hi.
- Hey.

53:10.153 --> 53:12.849
So, did you dig anything up
about the break-in?

53:12.923 --> 53:15.187
- l got a map from my dad.
- Hey, how's it going?

53:15.258 --> 53:18.193
Shoeshine, you wouldn't
believe the date l had last night.

53:18.261 --> 53:20.092
lt was so amazing!

53:20.163 --> 53:22.996
- [sighs] Yeah, it was.
- What?

53:23.066 --> 53:25.159
l mean, it was?

53:25.235 --> 53:28.204
Can you keep a secret?
l went out with Underdog.

53:28.271 --> 53:31.502
Really? l hear he's shorter in person.

53:31.575 --> 53:34.544
He is not.
He's quite strapping and such a charmer.

53:34.611 --> 53:35.839
Hmm.

53:36.546 --> 53:38.207
- A drainage pipe?
- Yeah.

53:38.281 --> 53:40.977
They could've entered
directly through the sewers.

53:41.051 --> 53:45.385
l want him back. l want his power.

53:45.989 --> 53:48.048
My dog is not Underdog.

53:48.125 --> 53:52.425
You seem to have a knack
for underestimating the exceptional.

53:53.864 --> 53:55.456
You're insane!

53:55.532 --> 53:58.660
l prefer the term ''visionary!''

54:01.371 --> 54:05.705
Call your dog or l'll call mine.

54:12.482 --> 54:15.042
Or l'll call mine.

54:16.753 --> 54:19.244
Cad...

54:19.322 --> 54:21.153
Oh, right, the dogs.

54:21.224 --> 54:26.821
Simon says, ''Surround the sad ex-cop.''

54:26.897 --> 54:29.058
Simon says, ''Convince.''

54:29.132 --> 54:32.397
[barking]

54:32.469 --> 54:34.164
All right, all right.

54:34.237 --> 54:35.761
Shoeshine!

54:37.774 --> 54:39.708
[Dan] Shoeshine!

54:39.776 --> 54:41.710
Hey, um, l got to go.

54:41.778 --> 54:44.542
[barks three times]

54:44.614 --> 54:47.276
Hey, um, l got to go.

54:47.350 --> 54:49.318
But, Jack, we were...

54:51.354 --> 54:53.618
That is one strange beagle.

54:54.891 --> 54:56.722
- What? What is it?
- lt's your dad.

54:56.793 --> 54:59.057
He's in trouble.
The guy from the lab got him.

54:59.129 --> 55:01.154
Go to the police station
and wait for me.

55:01.231 --> 55:03.791
No. He's my dad.
You're not going to go without me.

55:03.867 --> 55:05.926
All right. Fasten your seat belts.

55:06.002 --> 55:07.867
lt's going to be a bumpy ride.

55:07.938 --> 55:09.735
Whoa. Ahh!

55:09.806 --> 55:11.933
Ahhh!

55:25.522 --> 55:27.319
[Jack] Whoo-hoo!

55:27.390 --> 55:27.491
- [barking]
- Shoeshine!

55:27.491 --> 55:30.483
- [barking]
- Shoeshine!

55:30.560 --> 55:33.393
[barking continues]

55:34.631 --> 55:36.963
- Shoeshine.
- Dad!

55:37.033 --> 55:38.728
- Easy, tiger.
- [Dan] Jack!

55:38.802 --> 55:41.168
Jack, what's going on...
What's going on here?

55:41.238 --> 55:43.297
''Shoeshine,'' isn't it?

55:43.373 --> 55:47.207
<i>Or shall l address you
by your nom de guerre...</i>

55:47.277 --> 55:49.438
...''Underdog?''

55:49.513 --> 55:52.414
- lt's ''Shoeshine.''
- He can talk?

55:52.482 --> 55:54.848
<i>Yep, Barsinister had me beat.</i>

55:54.918 --> 55:57.512
<i>There was no way I could
save both of them.</i>

55:57.587 --> 56:01.353
l'm sorry. Do whatever you want to me.
Just let them go.

56:03.760 --> 56:06.752
Wise decision. [chuckling]

56:06.830 --> 56:11.028
<i>Turns out, Barsinister didn't want me.
He wanted my DNA.</i>

56:11.101 --> 56:15.333
<i>He took away my super powers
and put them in a little blue pill.</i>

56:15.405 --> 56:17.839
<i>But that wasn't the worst of it.</i>

56:19.809 --> 56:22.334
And in this pill,

56:22.412 --> 56:25.813
there is the DNA of a regular beagle.

56:25.882 --> 56:28.248
Shoeshine, don't do it! No!

56:29.619 --> 56:31.985
Do you know what the saddest part is?

56:33.223 --> 56:36.158
You actually thought
that they loved you.

56:36.226 --> 56:40.128
They only loved the power
that l gave you.

56:40.197 --> 56:41.528
No!

56:45.969 --> 56:48.164
[Jack] No, Shoeshine.

56:49.839 --> 56:52.034
Jack! Ahhh!

56:52.108 --> 56:55.134
[whimpering] l didn't...
want... anyone...

56:55.212 --> 56:59.512
...to get... hurt. [groaning]

57:01.785 --> 57:04.720
- Shoeshine!
- [whimpers]

57:05.655 --> 57:07.919
[Barsinister] Cad.

57:07.991 --> 57:11.188
Not so tough now, are we, little doggie?

57:11.261 --> 57:12.728
Let's go.

57:12.796 --> 57:18.701
This city is going to pay for what
they have done to me. Their doubt.

57:18.768 --> 57:21.760
Their blindness.

57:21.838 --> 57:24.602
Their betrayal.

57:32.816 --> 57:34.943
Simon says, ''Heel.''

57:35.018 --> 57:36.986
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

57:45.095 --> 57:48.121
<i>All those powers and
I wound up jeopardizing</i>

57:48.198 --> 57:51.065
<i>the only thing I cared about, my family.</i>

57:53.737 --> 57:56.672
<i>And while I was stuck down there
feeling sorry for myself,</i>

57:56.740 --> 58:00.335
<i>Cad and Barsinister
had returned to the capitol.</i>

58:07.951 --> 58:10.647
Help! Help us!

58:10.720 --> 58:12.915
[straining]

58:12.989 --> 58:14.923
Jack, that's not going to help.

58:14.991 --> 58:18.586
- You got to get untied.
- [grunts] Forget it.

58:18.662 --> 58:20.892
Jack, don't quit!

58:20.964 --> 58:22.795
- Quit?
- Yeah!

58:22.866 --> 58:24.959
Me? What about you?

58:25.035 --> 58:27.026
You were the best cop in the city

58:27.103 --> 58:29.594
and you should be up there
stopping Barsinister.

58:29.673 --> 58:32.107
But you quit!
You quit the force!

58:33.410 --> 58:35.071
l did quit.

58:35.145 --> 58:37.136
l quit, Jack.

58:37.213 --> 58:40.705
l quit because l didn't want
anything to happen to me.

58:40.784 --> 58:42.445
l didn't want to leave you alone.

58:51.261 --> 58:55.197
Jack, we have to get untied.

58:56.366 --> 58:57.924
Now, just back up.

58:58.001 --> 59:00.162
Put your foot on that ledge.

59:00.236 --> 59:03.672
Grab that rope and jump up.
There you go!

59:03.740 --> 59:05.867
Come over here
and let me untie you.

59:05.942 --> 59:07.705
Sit down.

59:12.382 --> 59:14.612
lt's on so tight.

59:14.684 --> 59:17.619
The reason we're down here is me.

59:17.687 --> 59:20.485
All l had to do was just tell you
Shoeshine was Underdog.

59:20.557 --> 59:22.650
l'll tell you what you
should've told me...

59:23.393 --> 59:28.296
...that you gave my JV baseball
sweater away to a superhero!

59:31.368 --> 59:33.700
OK. OK.

59:35.105 --> 59:36.572
[Dan] Grab Shoeshine.

59:36.639 --> 59:39.369
[Jack] Come on, Shoeshine.
Come on, boy.

59:40.577 --> 59:42.067
All right, son, let's go.

59:42.145 --> 59:44.739
There has been an overwhelming
response, Mr. Mayor.

59:44.814 --> 59:46.839
- Good.
- You've never had this much press.

59:46.916 --> 59:48.975
Make sure they get
a good view of the dogs.

59:49.052 --> 59:50.451
[Barsinister] Mr. Mayor.

59:50.520 --> 59:53.489
Do you have time
to consider my proposal now?

59:53.556 --> 59:57.185
Holy moly! Barsinister.

59:57.260 --> 01:00:01.026
- [sirens blaring]
- Start rolling, start rolling.

01:00:02.932 --> 01:00:06.368
Move! Go, go, go, go, go!

01:00:06.436 --> 01:00:09.894
[crowd chattering]

01:00:12.008 --> 01:00:15.205
- There. Where's Underdog?
- [camera shutters clicking]

01:00:15.278 --> 01:00:17.473
[woman] l'm at the steps
of the capitol building,

01:00:17.547 --> 01:00:19.572
where on the eve
of his press announcement

01:00:19.649 --> 01:00:21.708
it seems the mayor has been kidnapped.

01:00:21.785 --> 01:00:24.049
Now, SWAT has secured the perimeter

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:28.056
and we're still waiting to find out
more information, any information.

01:00:49.512 --> 01:00:51.912
[boy] Come on, hurry up. Let's go.

01:00:51.981 --> 01:00:53.573
[indistinct chattering]

01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:56.642
[Jack] Excuse me.
Trying to get through. Sorry. Pardon me.

01:00:56.719 --> 01:00:59.313
- [Dan] Excuse me.
- [boy] Come on. Get Underdog!

01:01:00.356 --> 01:01:03.325
- [man] Has anyone seen him?
- [Jack] We're too late.

01:01:03.393 --> 01:01:06.453
- Now what are we going to do?
- [man] Where's Underdog?

01:01:18.908 --> 01:01:20.341
Please stay back!

01:01:20.410 --> 01:01:23.106
[girl] Underdog has
to be here somewhere.

01:01:23.179 --> 01:01:26.205
[policeman] Everyone, please stay back.

01:01:26.282 --> 01:01:29.911
Shoeshine, l don't know
if you can understand me right now,

01:01:29.986 --> 01:01:31.977
but forget about the past.

01:01:32.055 --> 01:01:36.151
lt doesn't matter if you're
Shoeshine or Underdog.

01:01:36.226 --> 01:01:38.854
Because l don't care
if you can talk or fly.

01:01:38.928 --> 01:01:41.556
You brought my family back together.

01:01:41.631 --> 01:01:43.360
You're a hero to me.

01:01:48.771 --> 01:01:52.036
<i>- There I was, a regular old dog again.
- [sniffing]</i>

01:01:52.108 --> 01:01:54.872
<i>I had no idea how to stop Barsinister.</i>

01:01:54.944 --> 01:01:58.471
<i>But I did know one thing.
I smelled a bomb.</i>

01:01:58.548 --> 01:02:01.984
<i>Could I trust my nose again?
Could I afford not to?</i>

01:02:02.051 --> 01:02:03.848
<i>What are the chances there's a ham</i>

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:06.388
<i>strapped to the roof
of the capitol building?</i>

01:02:18.968 --> 01:02:20.629
[barking]

01:02:20.703 --> 01:02:23.536
All right. What are your demands?

01:02:23.606 --> 01:02:27.736
A billion dollars
from this city's treasury,

01:02:28.778 --> 01:02:31.178
full immunity from the law

01:02:31.247 --> 01:02:34.045
and my lab restored

01:02:34.117 --> 01:02:38.884
so l can continue my research
to help the human animal,

01:02:39.689 --> 01:02:42.681
to chart a new future

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:45.585
for the good of mankind.

01:02:49.666 --> 01:02:54.069
<i>It was brave of me to charge in there,
but pretty dumb not to have a plan.</i>

01:02:54.137 --> 01:02:58.335
<i>Was I thinking that a solution
was going to fall out of the sky?</i>

01:03:08.484 --> 01:03:11.419
[Barsinister] What? Him again?

01:03:11.487 --> 01:03:13.387
- [dog 1] Mine!
- [dog 2] No, mine!

01:03:13.456 --> 01:03:15.549
[Barsinister] Are you kidding me?

01:03:22.498 --> 01:03:25.058
That will teach you to mess with me.

01:03:28.771 --> 01:03:32.434
Simon says... ''Lunch!''

01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:38.106
Don't worry. lt will be over in no time.

01:03:38.181 --> 01:03:40.615
You're not even big enough
to be table scraps.

01:03:40.683 --> 01:03:45.950
There's no need to fear.
Underdog is here.

01:03:46.022 --> 01:03:47.751
- Huh?
- [dog 2] Wait.

01:03:51.227 --> 01:03:53.388
How did you...?

01:03:56.499 --> 01:03:58.091
Simon says, ''Attack.''

01:03:58.167 --> 01:04:00.931
l would love to stay
and chat, but l got to find

01:04:01.004 --> 01:04:02.096
where the bomb is at.

01:04:02.171 --> 01:04:04.537
- Whoa.
- After him!

01:04:04.607 --> 01:04:06.939
- Liftoff!
- Make sure he doesn't get outside!

01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:08.136
Come back here!

01:04:08.211 --> 01:04:11.738
My powers may be back at last,
but these German shepherds are too fast.

01:04:11.814 --> 01:04:13.111
l'm on your tail!

01:04:13.182 --> 01:04:16.049
What is with that dog?

01:04:19.756 --> 01:04:21.087
- [barks]
- Huh?

01:04:21.157 --> 01:04:23.352
- Hey. Hey!
- [Polly barks]

01:04:23.426 --> 01:04:27.419
- Help!
- Oh, no. lt's Polly. She's in danger.

01:04:27.497 --> 01:04:28.794
Help!

01:04:28.865 --> 01:04:32.130
- Polly, help me!
- Get off my trousers!

01:04:32.201 --> 01:04:35.068
Help! Help!

01:04:35.138 --> 01:04:37.538
You and your boss
will never get away with this.

01:04:37.607 --> 01:04:40.041
He's not my boss! We're partners!

01:04:40.109 --> 01:04:41.542
Then why are you doing this?

01:04:41.611 --> 01:04:44.637
Because my partner said
he might fire me if l don't!

01:04:44.714 --> 01:04:46.682
l got him!
l'm getting tired up here.

01:04:48.184 --> 01:04:51.210
Gosh! Can l not get a break here?

01:04:52.555 --> 01:04:55.922
ldiot dogs. l have to do
everything myself.

01:04:57.694 --> 01:04:59.355
You get him! Whoo!

01:04:59.429 --> 01:05:00.794
- Cut him off!
- Come on!

01:05:00.863 --> 01:05:03.058
Uh-oh, no brakes. No brakes!

01:05:04.701 --> 01:05:05.895
[dog] Look out!

01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:12.007
[Underdog] Whoa. Look out. Whoa!

01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:14.833
Wow. [grunts]

01:05:14.911 --> 01:05:18.642
And he sticks the landing.
Where am l?

01:05:18.715 --> 01:05:20.376
Oh, it's you again.

01:05:23.152 --> 01:05:24.949
[growling]

01:05:25.021 --> 01:05:28.582
[Underdog] You know,
l said a lot of things l kind of regret.

01:05:28.658 --> 01:05:31.456
l believe that sword
belongs to the lady.

01:05:35.331 --> 01:05:37.526
Hey, batter, batter.
You're no good at all.

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:39.898
Here. You want to play some ball?

01:05:41.904 --> 01:05:44.566
Doc, l got you. [grunting]

01:05:48.211 --> 01:05:49.769
Cad's hit. Cad's hit.

01:05:55.284 --> 01:05:57.844
l'll play your game.
lt might be a stretch.

01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:59.547
Can you resist this?

01:05:59.622 --> 01:06:01.817
Simon says, ''Fetch!''

01:06:03.693 --> 01:06:05.422
Frisbee!

01:06:08.464 --> 01:06:10.796
Whoa.

01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:15.895
Whoo! Didn't see that coming.

01:06:17.206 --> 01:06:19.640
l think l pulled something.

01:06:19.709 --> 01:06:22.644
OK. l got to get to that bomb.

01:06:22.712 --> 01:06:25.374
- [growling]
- Oh, no. OK.

01:06:25.448 --> 01:06:28.008
Come on, guys, uh,
we're all dogs here.

01:06:28.084 --> 01:06:30.780
Can't we just work
this out dog-to-dog?

01:06:30.853 --> 01:06:33.913
They're not going
to listen to you, Shoeshine.

01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:37.551
They're loyal to me. [cackles]

01:06:37.627 --> 01:06:40.152
Listen. Why do you even
follow his orders?

01:06:40.229 --> 01:06:42.163
What does that creep do for you?

01:06:42.231 --> 01:06:45.723
Huh? Does he take you for walks?
Does he give you treats?

01:06:45.802 --> 01:06:48.327
Has he ever once
scratched your bellies? Huh?

01:06:48.404 --> 01:06:49.598
Just once?

01:06:49.672 --> 01:06:51.503
l mean, look, if he was a good boss,

01:06:51.574 --> 01:06:53.906
he'd be able to get
a higher quality sidekick.

01:06:53.976 --> 01:06:56.137
[groaning] Hey, l heard that.

01:06:56.212 --> 01:06:59.443
You're man's best friend,
but is he your best friend?

01:06:59.515 --> 01:07:01.745
Has he even given any of you a name?

01:07:01.818 --> 01:07:03.786
Of course. My name is Kill.

01:07:03.853 --> 01:07:05.252
Hey, l thought l was Kill.

01:07:05.321 --> 01:07:08.654
- No, you're Attack.
- No, l'm Attack. He's Maim.

01:07:09.525 --> 01:07:12.460
Destroy him!
You worthless mutts!

01:07:12.528 --> 01:07:16.692
- Do you mind, Doc?
- [dog 2] We're talking over here.

01:07:16.766 --> 01:07:18.791
Who's he to call you worthless?

01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:20.426
He's got a point.

01:07:20.503 --> 01:07:23.666
Our master doesn't value us
as sparkling individuals.

01:07:23.739 --> 01:07:26.139
Yeah, let's go, Maim and Attack.

01:07:26.209 --> 01:07:28.769
- lt's time to go change teams.
- What are you doing?

01:07:28.845 --> 01:07:32.303
- Let's go teach the master a lesson.
- Bad dogs!

01:07:32.381 --> 01:07:35.544
[Underdog]
There are no bad dogs, only bad owners.

01:07:35.618 --> 01:07:39.554
Don't worry, Doc.
This will only hurt a lot.

01:07:39.622 --> 01:07:42.853
[growling]

01:07:44.026 --> 01:07:46.995

you can stop me, runt?

01:07:53.202 --> 01:07:54.829

You have two minutes before
a bomb explodes over Capitol City,

that will make every citizen

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:07.179
as obedient to me as a common dog.

01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:09.184
Hold him until the cops get here.

01:08:09.252 --> 01:08:11.083
[dog] Easy, Doc.

01:08:11.153 --> 01:08:13.348
[dog 2] You're just gonna hurt yourself.

01:08:13.422 --> 01:08:15.583
[dog 3] Now who's the boss?

01:08:16.492 --> 01:08:19.017
- [bomb beeping]
- Help!

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:26.658
Jack, we don't have much time.

01:08:26.736 --> 01:08:28.863

- How did you...?

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:31.872
l'd love to chat, but l got
to get dressed for work.

01:08:34.477 --> 01:08:34.609

Jack, come on. l'm a cop.

01:08:39.015 --> 01:08:42.576

- l'm a cop. You got to let me through.

01:08:42.652 --> 01:08:45.086
Mr. Mayor. Are you all right?

01:08:45.154 --> 01:08:47.679
Let me handle Barsinister.
l know what he's doing.

01:08:47.756 --> 01:08:49.782
- Not now. Police business.
- l know...

01:08:49.859 --> 01:08:52.919
- This man is no longer on the force!
- Pipe down, Chief!

01:08:52.995 --> 01:08:56.487
You're reinstated. You're promoted.
Do whatever you have to do.

to send up, the hero idiot.

01:09:07.843 --> 01:09:10.676

How many other flying dogs
in red sweaters do you know?

01:09:45.481 --> 01:09:48.279
Underdog, l just knew
you would come.

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:51.877
Quick, there's not much time.
Take the vial to the police.

01:09:51.953 --> 01:09:55.412
- You got it.
- Don't drop it.

01:09:59.362 --> 01:10:01.887
Look! lt's Underdog!

Yeah, see you around, kid.

You're going to love solitary, Doc.

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:54.228
My isolation will be nothing
more than an enclave

my intellectual powers

01:12:57.406 --> 01:13:00.102

01:13:02.978 --> 01:13:04.468
You know what?

01:13:04.547 --> 01:13:07.675
Solitary is a relative term, Doc.

too paradoxical for you.

- No, you can't do this to me.
- Yes, l can. l just did.

01:13:26.035 --> 01:13:28.128
Noo!

01:13:28.204 --> 01:13:30.035

ran out with the bomb

01:13:30.105 --> 01:13:32.801
and buried it farther than
any bone has ever been buried!

01:13:32.875 --> 01:13:34.843
Sounds like l missed all the excitement.

01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:38.676
