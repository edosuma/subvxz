WEBVTT

00:05.657 --> 00:07.311
- Detective Tierney.

00:07.355 --> 00:09.183
Officer Ruzek, Intelligence.

00:09.226 --> 00:10.619
- Your sergeant's
with our body.

00:10.662 --> 00:13.056
Or, well, what's left of it.

00:13.100 --> 00:15.145
Body popped as indexed with
the case you're working.

00:15.189 --> 00:16.799
Victim's connected
to Gael Rodriguez.

00:16.842 --> 00:19.280
- Yeah, the guy's a head of a
drug trafficking organization.

00:19.323 --> 00:20.455
- Yeah, I know who he is.

00:20.498 --> 00:22.587
Worked him for three years
with Narcotics.

00:22.631 --> 00:24.589
Guy brought in 1,000 kilos
of dope a month

00:24.633 --> 00:26.548
and we couldn't find a way
to touch him.

00:26.591 --> 00:28.506
Follow the smell.

00:32.902 --> 00:35.078
- And I take it no witnesses.
- Nope.

00:35.122 --> 00:36.645
A couple of junkies broke in
to party.

00:36.688 --> 00:38.081
They found her.
- Boss...

00:38.125 --> 00:39.691
- Acid hadn't fully dissolved
her skull yet

00:39.735 --> 00:42.172
so we managed to pull
the ID from a serial number

00:42.216 --> 00:43.434
off a dental implant.

00:43.478 --> 00:45.523
She's Isabel PeÃ±a.

00:48.570 --> 00:50.441
- Gael's girlfriend.
- Yep.

00:50.485 --> 00:51.877
Guessing she stepped
out of line.

00:51.921 --> 00:54.402
He got rid of her.
Same old story.

00:56.752 --> 00:59.233
- There's no way
you're pulling Gael's DNA.

00:59.276 --> 01:01.409
- No, it's a stroke
of high junkie luck

01:01.452 --> 01:03.193
that we even got her identity.

01:03.237 --> 01:04.760
There's not a chance
we can pin it to Gael,

01:04.803 --> 01:06.631
but we are
definitely gonna try.

01:06.675 --> 01:08.677
I'll keep you looped if
there's anything you can use.

01:08.720 --> 01:11.288
- Appreciate it, Hannah.
- Hey, Voight...

01:11.332 --> 01:13.769
- Huh?
- You guys anywhere on him?

01:13.812 --> 01:15.423
- We're getting a foothold.

01:15.466 --> 01:17.686
We're working his number two,
a guy named TJ.

01:17.729 --> 01:20.471
- Well, I suppose life on
drug charges is something, huh?

01:24.171 --> 01:26.390
- Hey, I want that deal
set now.

01:26.434 --> 01:28.175
- Atwater and Rojas
are with TJ.

01:28.218 --> 01:29.872
They're trying,
but the guy's a handful.

01:29.915 --> 01:32.353
- I don't care.
I want it set tonight.

01:32.396 --> 01:34.181
Get TJ,
you get him to flip,

01:34.224 --> 01:36.444
and you get Gael
off the street.

01:36.487 --> 01:37.749
- Come on, TJ.

01:37.793 --> 01:39.403
How many more times
we gotta dance for you

01:39.447 --> 01:41.144
to tell you that we're good
for it?

01:41.188 --> 01:44.452
- Maria, you know who
I work for, right?

01:44.495 --> 01:46.410
So you know the product's good.

01:46.454 --> 01:47.629
So I think the two of you
are gonna sit here

01:47.672 --> 01:50.414
long as I want,
until I feel all right.

01:54.549 --> 01:56.159
- If this guy's
any more careful,

01:56.203 --> 01:58.292
I'm gonna blow my brains out.

01:58.335 --> 01:59.293
- You know,
if I worked for Gael,

01:59.336 --> 02:00.990
I'd be the same way.

02:01.033 --> 02:03.645
- Yes, but we've already given
you 10% on top of the four.

02:03.688 --> 02:05.473
That's more money than
we've ever given anybody

02:05.516 --> 02:06.517
and that's only because

02:06.561 --> 02:08.345
we wanna do this with you
long haul.

02:08.389 --> 02:10.782
- All right, 12% uptick
for a test run,

02:10.826 --> 02:12.175
then we talk.
- Hell no.

02:12.219 --> 02:13.437
I'm not doing this with you
no more, bro.

02:13.481 --> 02:16.614
It's 12 then 10,
and that's now or not at all.

02:16.658 --> 02:18.573
But if you wanna make us
sit here and play with us

02:18.616 --> 02:19.965
and try to have
a pissing contest

02:20.009 --> 02:21.750
just because your boss
got a big product,

02:21.793 --> 02:25.232
I can walk my black ass
up out of here.

02:25.275 --> 02:28.496
- I'm gonna go grab
another drink.

02:28.539 --> 02:30.628
- Whoa, what the hell
is she doing?

02:30.672 --> 02:32.282
- See?
About time to wrap it up

02:32.326 --> 02:33.327
when she can't
control herself.

02:33.370 --> 02:35.459
- Hey.
- What's going on, Vee?

02:35.503 --> 02:36.460
What are you doing here?

02:36.504 --> 02:38.114
You said you were
working tonight.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.290
- Well, I got off work early.
I'm just trying to get drunk.

02:40.334 --> 02:44.642
- Oh, you're doing it wrong.
Who ya--who ya here with?

02:44.686 --> 02:46.296
- No, no, just work people.

02:46.340 --> 02:47.819
- Yeah, the halfway house
is having drunk night

02:47.863 --> 02:48.994
at Perro Locos now?

02:49.038 --> 02:50.387
- Funny.
We didn't bring the alcoholics.

02:50.431 --> 02:52.302
You want whiskey?
Hey, can we get some whiskey?

02:52.346 --> 02:53.390
- Halfway house?

02:53.434 --> 02:54.435
What the hell
are they talking about?

02:54.478 --> 02:55.871
Who is this guy?
- I don't know.

02:55.914 --> 02:57.699
I've never seen him before.
- No, no, no, no.

02:57.742 --> 03:00.571
I wanna know what
this whole Vanessa Rojas

03:00.615 --> 03:02.747
hyped-out-of-her-mind thing is
you've got going on.

03:02.791 --> 03:04.488
- What are you talking about?

03:04.532 --> 03:06.273
- Why you look like
a shaky dog

03:06.316 --> 03:07.752
who about to piss the carpet?

03:07.796 --> 03:10.233
- Look, I'm just--I'm just
surprised to see you here.

03:10.277 --> 03:13.236
- Whoever he is,
he just used her real name.

03:13.280 --> 03:14.411
We gotta give 'em an out.
We should pull 'em.

03:14.455 --> 03:15.673
He can blow her cover.

03:15.717 --> 03:17.632
- If we pull 'erm,
we risk losing the buy.

03:17.675 --> 03:19.503
She can handle it.
She can do it.

03:19.547 --> 03:21.984
- Who you here with?
- Just work friends.

03:22.027 --> 03:23.812
- Yeah, yeah, I wanna--
I wanna meet him.

03:27.946 --> 03:30.862
- That's one way to do it.

03:34.301 --> 03:36.390
- What are you doing?

03:40.829 --> 03:43.919
- Atwater set the buy?
- Yep.

03:43.962 --> 03:47.531
Buy's all set.
You gave him enough time.

03:47.575 --> 03:50.055
So, who was that?

03:50.099 --> 03:52.667
- Uh, just a guy I know.
- Mm-hmm.

03:52.710 --> 03:54.712
- Ex-boyfriend.

03:54.756 --> 03:56.975
- Ex?
Looked more like current.

03:57.019 --> 04:00.370
- Yeah, I mean,
it's on again, off again.

04:00.414 --> 04:01.850
Ex might be more accurate.

04:01.893 --> 04:04.635
We just--we kind of fall
back into it a lot.

04:04.679 --> 04:06.550
- Hmm, so he's
still in your life.

04:06.594 --> 04:09.945
- Yeah, you know,
he's like family.

04:09.988 --> 04:11.773
- He doesn't seem
to know you're a cop.

04:13.949 --> 04:15.559
Vanessa, you've told
the people in your life

04:15.603 --> 04:18.040
you're a cop, right?

04:18.083 --> 04:21.913
- I-I don't really have
a lot of people.

04:21.957 --> 04:24.655
Just him, really,
and no.

04:24.699 --> 04:26.918
He's got no idea I'm a cop.

04:31.575 --> 04:33.011
- Okay.

04:38.626 --> 04:39.714
- Our scene is clean.

04:39.757 --> 04:41.368
Detective Ray
called it perfect.

04:41.411 --> 04:42.847
We got nothing.

04:42.891 --> 04:44.719
- That's 12 suspected bodies
on Gael,

04:44.762 --> 04:46.677
including his own cousin.

04:46.721 --> 04:48.853
- All right,
take it from the top again.

04:48.897 --> 04:51.334
- All right, our main target
today is Gael Rodriguez.

04:51.378 --> 04:53.728
He's a middleman between
cartels and gangs.

04:53.771 --> 04:55.425
He sells mass quantities
of drugs

04:55.469 --> 04:56.818
to west side gang factions.

04:56.861 --> 04:59.342
- As we know,
Gael is smart, okay?

04:59.386 --> 05:00.430
He doesn't leave a footprint.

05:00.474 --> 05:01.736
Doesn't touch the guns
or the product.

05:01.779 --> 05:04.347
Keeps his hands clean,
hard as hell to pin,

05:04.391 --> 05:06.567
but last night I think
we got a way in.

05:06.610 --> 05:08.786
TJ Trevino is set for a buy.

05:08.830 --> 05:11.659
- TJ confirmed he'd sell
four kilos as a test run.

05:11.702 --> 05:13.051
- The buy is set today,
3:00 p.m.

05:13.095 --> 05:15.445
- So money and drugs
exchange hands,

05:15.489 --> 05:17.969
we grab TJ,
flip him for Gael.

05:18.013 --> 05:20.581
Jay, I want you and Hailey
taking the lead on this one.

05:20.624 --> 05:22.626
Just remember,
I mean,

05:22.670 --> 05:23.932
we're running this guy
for drugs,

05:23.975 --> 05:27.414
but our objective
is to end the violence.

05:27.457 --> 05:29.416
Stay light.

05:29.459 --> 05:30.982
- Copy that.

05:31.026 --> 05:34.464
- Forty minutes.
- There's lots of glass.

05:34.508 --> 05:36.118
Think he's got eyes?

05:37.902 --> 05:39.382
All right,
let's pull back a bit.

05:39.426 --> 05:41.515
Switch your positions.
Loosen things up.

05:41.558 --> 05:44.474
Rojas, Kev,
are we missing something?

05:44.518 --> 05:45.649
- No, I don't think so.

05:45.693 --> 05:47.651
Plan was he'd post
his car up one side,

05:47.695 --> 05:48.696
we'd pull the other,

05:48.739 --> 05:49.827
switch keys inside
the building.

05:49.871 --> 05:51.438
Hand to hand.

05:51.481 --> 05:53.875
- I've got no movement
up front, guys.

05:53.918 --> 05:55.311
- There's nothing out back.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.879
If the car was here,
it arrived before we got here.

05:57.922 --> 06:00.011
- Kev, why don't you
give him a call?

06:00.055 --> 06:01.752
- Mm-hmm.

06:06.757 --> 06:09.978
- It ain't happening.
Deal's off.

06:10.021 --> 06:13.460
- That's no bueno because
we already set the deal.

06:13.503 --> 06:15.113
Now, if you wanna renegotiate
because you don't like

06:15.157 --> 06:16.767
where the money is,
you let me know that.

06:16.811 --> 06:18.769
- Boss said no new partners.

06:18.813 --> 06:22.077
- What do I have to do, TJ?
Get to know the boss?

06:22.120 --> 06:23.513
Does the boss have
to get to know me?

06:23.557 --> 06:24.819
Do I have to babysit his kids?

06:24.862 --> 06:26.734
Let me know what I have to do
to make it work.

06:26.777 --> 06:29.040
- No, that ain't how it works.
He said no.

06:29.084 --> 06:30.520
Deal's dead.

06:30.564 --> 06:31.913
- TJ...

06:38.963 --> 06:41.923
Game over.

06:43.881 --> 06:46.797
- Son of a bitch.

06:48.277 --> 06:50.497
- Atwater pressed him.
TJ held strong.

06:50.540 --> 06:51.715
- He get burned?
- I don't think so.

06:51.759 --> 06:53.021
I don't think he ever showed.
- Huh.

06:53.064 --> 06:54.979
- Look, maybe Gael smelled
something was off

06:55.023 --> 06:57.068
or TJ was talking game
he couldn't back up.

06:57.112 --> 06:59.549
Either way, no new partners
means we're dead on undercover.

07:00.768 --> 07:02.552
- Gael just killed
his girlfriend.

07:02.596 --> 07:04.467
He's probably laying low,
scattering.

07:04.511 --> 07:06.469
We've seen guys
like this before.

07:06.513 --> 07:09.646
What happened is
Gael's good at his job.

07:09.690 --> 07:11.082
- Betting we can make
all this sound

07:11.126 --> 07:13.563
like we've exhausted
all options.

07:13.607 --> 07:15.217
- You thinking Title Three?

07:15.260 --> 07:19.177
- We get one,
we'll do a full-scale wire.

07:19.221 --> 07:20.265
- Okay.

07:22.833 --> 07:23.965
Have you ever done
a wire investigation?

07:24.008 --> 07:25.096
- Mm-mm.

07:25.140 --> 07:26.576
- Welcome home.
You live here now.

07:26.620 --> 07:28.709
- All right,

07:28.752 --> 07:31.668
we don't have nearly enough
for a warrant on Gael.

07:31.712 --> 07:34.758
The judge agreed that we do
have enough for a Title Three

07:34.802 --> 07:36.107
on TJ's burner,

07:36.151 --> 07:38.283
so that's where
this wire's gonna start.

07:38.327 --> 07:39.720
We'll listen
to every call he makes,

07:39.763 --> 07:41.548
every word he says.

07:41.591 --> 07:43.071
Then we build.

07:44.986 --> 07:47.249
No organization can move
this much product

07:47.292 --> 07:50.165
without a trace
to their boss.

07:50.208 --> 07:52.646
There's 1,000 paths
up and down.

07:54.343 --> 07:57.128
TJ will lead us to them.

07:59.261 --> 08:02.307
Everything might be something.

08:02.351 --> 08:06.181
Who TJ talks to,
who he calls,

08:06.224 --> 08:09.793
who calls him,
the women he's screwing,

08:09.837 --> 08:11.186
his baby mamas,

08:11.229 --> 08:14.189
the side chick he thinks
no one knows about.

08:14.232 --> 08:16.147
Every person he meets with.

08:19.194 --> 08:21.979
Every potential buyer
he shakes hands with.

08:26.201 --> 08:28.725
They all become part
of the wire.

08:36.211 --> 08:39.170
The bars he's drinking at.

08:39.214 --> 08:42.652
Corners where he smokes.

08:42.696 --> 08:44.915
All the cars he's ever driven
to get there.

08:47.265 --> 08:49.224
The place he buys
his cigarettes,

08:49.267 --> 08:51.879
his gas, his coffee.

08:57.841 --> 09:03.238
We set up audio and video
everywhere this guy goes,

09:03.281 --> 09:06.371
and every time TJ meets,
looks,

09:06.415 --> 09:08.896
thinks about his boss Gael.

09:08.939 --> 09:10.593
We do this right,

09:10.637 --> 09:14.205
we build from TJ
right on up to Gael,

09:14.249 --> 09:17.818
hook him to
his entire organization,

09:17.861 --> 09:21.822
all before he ever knows
we were there.

09:21.865 --> 09:23.954
- You know one of his girls
reamed him out today

09:23.998 --> 09:26.000
for missing
four doctors appointments.

09:26.043 --> 09:27.958
- She ain't wrong.

09:28.002 --> 09:29.873
He smokes five packs a day.

09:29.917 --> 09:31.222
- And what does he do?

09:31.266 --> 09:33.747
Hangs up on her
and chain smokes ten tabs.

09:33.790 --> 09:36.880
Crazy.

09:36.924 --> 09:39.709
Ooh, we got movement.

09:39.753 --> 09:42.190
Here go the big boss.

09:46.107 --> 09:48.065
Yep, that's Gael.

09:51.373 --> 09:54.071
Every time.

09:54.115 --> 09:55.725
We can't get this man
close enough to anything

09:55.769 --> 09:57.248
to get him on a mic.

09:57.292 --> 09:59.076
- Everything about him
is smart.

09:59.120 --> 10:00.251
You look at him,

10:00.295 --> 10:02.036
you'd never think
he sells cartel dopem

10:02.079 --> 10:05.126
kills anyone who breaks a rule.

10:05.169 --> 10:08.912
- Hell of a double life.
- Mm-hmm.

10:11.306 --> 10:12.916
- I need a protein refill.
You want one?

10:12.960 --> 10:14.309
- No, I'm good.

10:14.352 --> 10:17.442
- All right, I'll be back.
Look alive.

11:18.416 --> 11:22.464
- Oho!

11:22.507 --> 11:23.857
- What are you talking about?

11:23.900 --> 11:25.510
- Seven days, huh?

11:25.554 --> 11:27.425
You know, I've been taking bets
how many days you were

11:27.469 --> 11:28.426
gonna avoid me this time.

11:28.470 --> 11:29.906
- I've been busy at work.

11:29.950 --> 11:32.387
- Yeah, that's a boring lie.

11:32.430 --> 11:34.302
- Fine.

11:34.345 --> 11:35.782
Sober light of morning, then.

11:35.825 --> 11:40.308
- Or you were, uh,
seeing somebody

11:40.351 --> 11:43.485
and you didn't want me to think
that we were gonna start up.

11:43.528 --> 11:45.487
- You know,
if a girl avoids you,

11:45.530 --> 11:49.360
sometimes it's just about you.
- Eh.

11:49.404 --> 11:50.666
- Fine.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.581
I didn't wanna
confuse your little brain.

11:52.624 --> 11:55.758
I kissed you 'cause of
the cheap beer and bad weed.

11:55.802 --> 11:57.455
- Oh.

11:57.499 --> 11:59.457
- Yeah, I'm not
starting things up.

11:59.501 --> 12:01.459
- That's good.

12:03.026 --> 12:04.680
'Cause I was gonna
say no anyway.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.813
- Sure.
That felt like a no.

12:06.856 --> 12:08.336
- Mm-hmm.

12:10.468 --> 12:13.689
- Since when are you hanging
at Perro Loco, anyway?

12:13.733 --> 12:15.343
You know, friends from work
say nothing good

12:15.386 --> 12:18.650
happens out of there.
- I know that.

12:18.694 --> 12:21.610
- And they say it's used
for running deals.

12:21.653 --> 12:23.830
You into something?
- No.

12:23.873 --> 12:25.309
I'm not into anything.

12:25.353 --> 12:27.355
- Then since when
are you hanging there?

12:27.398 --> 12:29.792
- Since when are you?

12:31.489 --> 12:32.752
All right, all right,
so let me get this straight.

12:32.795 --> 12:34.884
Uh, a guy you're seeing
from work

12:34.928 --> 12:36.538
is whispering in your ear,

12:36.581 --> 12:38.583
and now you think
I'm out hustling?

12:38.627 --> 12:39.976
- If you were,

12:40.020 --> 12:42.457
I think the guys there aren't
exactly run a dime,

12:42.500 --> 12:44.981
get a dime.
I mean, they sound legit.

12:45.025 --> 12:47.854
- Listen, if somebody wants
a car disappeared,

12:47.897 --> 12:49.551
guess who they go to?

12:49.594 --> 12:51.596
- You sure you're not running--
- What are you doing?

12:54.425 --> 12:56.297
I mean, I just gave you
your answer

12:56.340 --> 12:59.866
to a question you don't even
have a right asking me.

12:59.909 --> 13:01.128
- Okay.

13:01.171 --> 13:02.520
- You haven't asked me
something like that

13:02.564 --> 13:05.306
since I got out.

13:05.349 --> 13:07.656
Three years inside, remember?

13:10.441 --> 13:13.488
This wasn't part of the deal.
- I said okay.

13:21.801 --> 13:24.412
- So we got Gael's cars
and his address,

13:24.455 --> 13:26.588
but so far he's not doing
anything incriminating

13:26.631 --> 13:27.894
on the wire.
The more intel we gather,

13:27.937 --> 13:29.373
it's pretty clear
that he keeps himself clean.

13:29.417 --> 13:30.984
He trusts his men.
He goes to them directly.

13:31.027 --> 13:32.594
- It's TJ who meets
with all the buyers.

13:32.637 --> 13:34.857
Schmoozes them up,
oversees all the drug deals.

13:34.901 --> 13:37.599
- Yeah, it seems like the only
time he gets directly involved

13:37.642 --> 13:39.383
is when a buyer needs
a big re-up.

13:39.427 --> 13:41.908
- So TJ needs Gael's order
to approve it.

13:41.951 --> 13:43.648
- Exactly.

13:43.692 --> 13:44.911
- Then you're looking
at tickling the wire,

13:44.954 --> 13:46.869
force Gael
to approve something?

13:46.913 --> 13:48.653
- Yeah, that's what
we're hoping.

13:48.697 --> 13:51.091
- All right, so who's
our best bet to do it?

13:51.134 --> 13:53.441
- I think we like Tyrell Young.

13:53.484 --> 13:54.790
He's a buyer for TJ

13:54.834 --> 13:56.444
and they've been meeting
pretty often.

13:56.487 --> 13:59.882
- Tyrell runs a dope stretch
in the Wild Hundreds.

13:59.926 --> 14:02.624
- Okay, so we flood
the area with buys,

14:02.667 --> 14:03.755
dry it out,

14:03.799 --> 14:05.409
and force this Tyrell to make

14:05.453 --> 14:07.063
a massive reorder of dope,
right?

14:07.107 --> 14:09.805
- And then we'll wait for TJ
to get Gael's approval.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.460
- I like it.
Listen, Hailey,

14:12.503 --> 14:15.637
I want you to oversee all
the call logs on this wire.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.900
We're gonna be assigned
ASA Becerra on this one.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.902
- Oh, the hard ass that worked
the Darius Walker case?

14:19.946 --> 14:21.512
- Yeah, so it's gotta be
by the book.

14:21.556 --> 14:22.862
Everything's gotta
be documented,

14:22.905 --> 14:24.646
pertinent and non-pertinent.

14:24.689 --> 14:26.909
We need every minute
of every call

14:26.953 --> 14:28.824
and video logged on this wire.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.782
Okay?
Good work.

14:47.669 --> 14:49.671
- All right, what is this?
What's going on?

14:49.714 --> 14:51.891
- Oh, I screwed up.
- Okay.

14:55.546 --> 14:57.853
I need the truth
so I can help.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.855
- The guy at the bar, Luis...

14:59.899 --> 15:01.901
- Mm-hmm?

15:01.944 --> 15:04.512
- He was on the wire.
He met with TJ.

15:04.555 --> 15:06.688
He only knows TJ
through the neighborhood.

15:06.731 --> 15:08.864
It's the cost of owning
an auto shop in Little Village.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.692
- You didn't.
- I deleted it.

15:12.215 --> 15:14.957
- I thought it would get lost
in the log no one saw.

15:15.001 --> 15:17.481
- Not in a case like this.

15:17.525 --> 15:20.441
Vanessa, that's obstruction.
You could go to jail.

15:23.183 --> 15:26.534
Give me the whole truth.
Now.

15:26.577 --> 15:29.493
- I've known him
since I was eight.

15:29.537 --> 15:32.844
- Okay.
- He's always had my back,

15:32.888 --> 15:35.935
even when it would have been
a hell of a lot easier not to.

15:35.978 --> 15:38.502
I owe him
and he's all I've got.

15:38.546 --> 15:40.113
- These guys
are violent criminals.

15:40.156 --> 15:41.941
How do you know he's not
involved in that or the drugs?

15:41.984 --> 15:44.160
- He would never hurt anybody,

15:44.204 --> 15:46.641
and I asked him about
the drugs.

15:46.684 --> 15:49.513
He's a good guy.
I know him.

15:49.557 --> 15:51.559
I know he's not involved
and I promise you

15:51.602 --> 15:53.561
he can't get us anywhere
on that case.

16:00.611 --> 16:02.874
- Okay, I'll take care of it.

16:02.918 --> 16:05.965
- Thank you.

16:06.008 --> 16:08.924
- Next time,
come to me first.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.057
- Yeah.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.596
- Got eyes on buyer one.
Letting the money walk.

16:31.816 --> 16:33.644
- All right,
buyer two exchanging now.

16:33.688 --> 16:35.472
- Copy.
I'm moving in.

17:01.672 --> 17:03.848
- Officer Gallins.

17:03.892 --> 17:06.025
Appreciate the commitment
to the undercover persona,

17:06.068 --> 17:08.592
but you will wash before
you re-enter my district.

17:08.636 --> 17:10.681
- Yes, ma'am.

17:12.683 --> 17:15.643
- Hey, we've seized about
a total of two bricks.

17:15.686 --> 17:17.732
- Good.
Corners are drying out fast.

17:17.775 --> 17:21.083
Matter of time before
they clear out completely.

17:21.127 --> 17:24.086
- You look lovely.
- I try.

17:26.175 --> 17:27.785
- Yo, Sarge,
we got him.

17:27.829 --> 17:29.570
It worked.

17:29.613 --> 17:31.876
- Got Tyrell Young
calling TJ

17:31.920 --> 17:33.661
requesting an immediate re-up,

17:33.704 --> 17:35.010
and then TJ calls

17:35.054 --> 17:36.620
a burner phone
two minutes later.

17:36.664 --> 17:38.100
It's Gael.

17:38.144 --> 17:39.623
- They like it white.

17:39.667 --> 17:40.885
Thinking they need
three barrels to cover it.

17:40.929 --> 17:43.540
- Fine, but we do
the job in person.

17:43.584 --> 17:46.108
Take it with Reyes.
Kid's a good painter.

17:46.152 --> 17:48.893
Meet him at the house early.
He'll have tools.

17:48.937 --> 17:50.330
- It's solid.

17:50.373 --> 17:51.766
It's the first time we've got
the boss giving orders.

17:51.809 --> 17:53.681
- Whole call is in code,
but we broke it down.

17:53.724 --> 17:54.943
They're meeting tomorrow
at 1:00 p.m.

17:54.986 --> 17:56.640
at an abandoned property
on the low end.

17:56.684 --> 17:58.860
- Only thing we don't know
is the kid Reyes.

17:58.903 --> 18:00.340
We're guessing he's
a trusted drug runner.

18:00.383 --> 18:01.776
"Tools" is probably traps.

18:01.819 --> 18:03.169
- Look, we get proof
of this deal,

18:03.212 --> 18:06.694
we now got Gael on the wire
showing he ordered it.

18:06.737 --> 18:08.913
So we hit that deal,
bust TJ,

18:08.957 --> 18:10.089
use him to corroborate.

18:10.132 --> 18:12.091
- Then we got him.
- Nice.

18:15.181 --> 18:17.835
- Runner's name was Reyes?

18:17.879 --> 18:20.142
- Yeah, we ran the name up
against all the guys we IDed

18:20.186 --> 18:21.883
off the wire.
So far no hits.

18:21.926 --> 18:24.712
You all good?
- Yeah, I'm good.

18:32.241 --> 18:34.069
- You lied to me.
- Good evening.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.244
Hi, how are you?

18:35.288 --> 18:36.245
- You said all you do
was disappear a car.

18:36.289 --> 18:37.203
That's not all you're doing,
is it?

18:37.246 --> 18:38.552
- I thought I made it
really clear

18:38.595 --> 18:39.901
I'm not talking to you about--
- Yes, you are.

18:39.944 --> 18:43.209
- Go home, Vanessa.
- So what is it, huh?

18:43.252 --> 18:45.080
You running drugs
out of the shop?

18:45.124 --> 18:47.213
You placing traps?
- Go home.

18:47.256 --> 18:49.998
- Or are you seriously
running them yourself?

18:50.041 --> 18:52.174
Luis Reyes
suddenly doing the job

18:52.218 --> 18:54.916
of an idiot 15-year-old.
- Who's talking to you?

18:54.959 --> 18:56.657
- We know the same people!
Come on!

18:56.700 --> 18:58.398
- We don't know
the same people!

18:58.441 --> 19:01.749
Not in the same way!
Not for years!

19:04.012 --> 19:06.101
Who's talking to you?
- It doesn't matter.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.102
- What do you mean,
it doesn't matter?

19:07.146 --> 19:08.625
Of course it matters!

19:08.669 --> 19:10.671
People talk like that
and they get killed

19:10.714 --> 19:12.107
and they could get
a bullet put in my head!

19:12.151 --> 19:14.283
- So you are placing traps.
- Answer the question.

19:17.373 --> 19:20.768
- A coworker is dating
a guy named TJ.

19:20.811 --> 19:23.074
He says you work for him.

19:23.118 --> 19:24.380
I know what he does.

19:24.424 --> 19:26.252
- You wanna do this?

19:26.295 --> 19:28.993
Fine.
Let's do it.

19:29.037 --> 19:30.952
I went to prison
so you wouldn't

19:30.995 --> 19:35.217
be standing where I am,
and I'm happy I did it.

19:35.261 --> 19:37.350
I'd do anything for you.
You know that,

19:37.393 --> 19:40.179
but you don't get to look at me
like I'm a failure.

19:40.222 --> 19:42.790
- I know.

19:42.833 --> 19:44.661
But whatever it
is that you're into,

19:44.705 --> 19:46.794
you need to lay off it.

19:46.837 --> 19:49.275
You need to get out.

19:49.318 --> 19:50.798
Now.

19:55.846 --> 19:57.718
- Go home, Vee.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.439
- Sarge.
Hi.

20:23.483 --> 20:26.094
What's going on?
We have a scene or something?

20:26.137 --> 20:28.792
- I know where you just were.

20:31.360 --> 20:34.189
We need to talk.

20:46.288 --> 20:49.857
- What's your relationship
to Luis Reyes?

20:49.900 --> 20:52.251
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

20:52.294 --> 20:55.732
Vanessa, I track
mudds and tolls

20:55.776 --> 20:58.692
on all wire investigations
in case we get burned.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.521
One of the cars we bugged

21:01.564 --> 21:05.307
pulled into
Luis's shop tonight.

21:05.351 --> 21:06.961
So did yours.
- Sarge, I should've--

21:07.004 --> 21:10.617
- I know you should've,
but you didn't.

21:10.660 --> 21:12.445
Did you?

21:12.488 --> 21:14.838
What you did do
is a fireable offense.

21:14.882 --> 21:19.408
Illegal,
if you tipped him off.

21:19.452 --> 21:22.585
So what's your relationship
to Luis Reyes?

21:24.848 --> 21:28.504
- I've known Luis
since I was in foster care.

21:28.548 --> 21:31.768
We got moved around a lot
but we always managed

21:31.812 --> 21:34.423
to find each other again.
- Mm-hmm.

21:34.467 --> 21:38.253
- Then we aged out,
we wound up living together,

21:38.297 --> 21:39.341
and then...

21:39.385 --> 21:42.475
- Then you got
in trouble together.

21:42.518 --> 21:46.870
Please, there's red flags
all over your file.

21:46.914 --> 21:48.959
So...

21:52.006 --> 21:54.748
- We got caught jacking cars.
- Mm-hmm.

21:54.791 --> 21:58.360
- And he took the full rap,
let me get off clean.

21:58.404 --> 21:59.883
- Did you tell him about
the wire?

21:59.927 --> 22:01.929
- I didn't tell him anything.

22:01.972 --> 22:03.409
I didn't tip him off.
I swear.

22:03.452 --> 22:04.714
I just wanted
to get him out of it.

22:04.758 --> 22:07.587
- Look, Vanessa, believe me.

22:07.630 --> 22:11.460
I know it's not easy,
but it is real simple.

22:13.810 --> 22:16.378
There's a clear line
between cops and criminals.

22:16.422 --> 22:18.728
You chose to be
on this side of it.

22:18.772 --> 22:21.035
That was your choice.
Your call.

22:21.078 --> 22:23.603
Nobody chased you.

22:24.821 --> 22:27.563
You think I give a damn
about your past?

22:29.870 --> 22:32.394
That's gonna make you
a good cop.

22:32.438 --> 22:35.397
Maybe a great cop.

22:35.441 --> 22:36.790
One day.

22:39.445 --> 22:42.883
But if Luis shows up
at that buy tomorrow,

22:42.926 --> 22:44.841
we're gonna arrest him.

22:44.885 --> 22:46.582
It's real simple.

22:51.631 --> 22:54.764
We're clear?
- Mm-hmm.

23:05.688 --> 23:09.039
- I'm just gonna hope
you didn't know all of that.

23:09.083 --> 23:11.041
- I didn't know all of it,
but I knew some.

23:15.481 --> 23:18.135
I was trying to protect her.

23:18.179 --> 23:20.094
- And that's your call to make?

23:20.137 --> 23:22.488
- I thought it was
the call you'd make.

23:38.634 --> 23:40.723
- Remember, we need
this deal to go down

23:40.767 --> 23:42.508
so we can get
Tyrell in custody,

23:42.551 --> 23:43.813
get him to corroborate.

23:43.857 --> 23:46.468
No one moves till I say so.

23:46.512 --> 23:48.992
- Copy that, Sarge.
- Copy.

23:52.909 --> 23:54.911
- We got movement
on the north end.

23:57.566 --> 23:59.002
Tyrell Young is here.

24:09.099 --> 24:11.493
Looks like we got
a blue Subaru headed our way.

24:11.537 --> 24:13.843
Maybe TJ's driving an unknown.

24:34.951 --> 24:36.736
- Sarge, we've got
a negative on TJ.

24:36.779 --> 24:38.781
Reyes is alone.

24:41.001 --> 24:43.873
- Copy that.
Wait for my word.

25:03.502 --> 25:06.156
- We got eyes on the drugs.

25:06.200 --> 25:10.900
One, two, three bricks.

25:10.944 --> 25:13.642
- Boss, if TJ's not here
and we take one of these guys,

25:13.686 --> 25:14.904
we might tip off the wire.

25:14.948 --> 25:18.212
- I know, but we need
to make a move now.

25:18.255 --> 25:21.084
All right,
we're gonna limit the risk.

25:21.128 --> 25:22.738
All right,
let the drugs walk.

25:22.782 --> 25:25.262
I repeat,
let Tyrell walk.

25:25.306 --> 25:27.743
We're gonna take Reyes alone.

25:27.787 --> 25:29.919
- Copy that.

25:47.589 --> 25:49.809
- Tyrell Young
has left the scene.

25:50.897 --> 25:53.552
- Luis is on the move.

25:53.595 --> 25:55.031
- All right, you're clear.
Take him now.

26:09.785 --> 26:14.137
- Chicago PD!
Get out of the car!

26:14.181 --> 26:16.096
Get out of the car now!

26:19.578 --> 26:21.144
Get out.

26:27.150 --> 26:29.152
On the car.

26:31.851 --> 26:33.679
Put your hands
behind your back.

26:59.748 --> 27:01.663
- Let me see your hands.

27:10.541 --> 27:12.805
Do you have a lawyer
you'd like us to call?

27:12.848 --> 27:14.371
- Yeah.

27:15.503 --> 27:18.201
- Name,
office if you know it,

27:18.245 --> 27:19.725
anyone else you'd like us
to call.

27:24.599 --> 27:26.688
I know Vanessa well.
She says you're a good guy.

27:26.732 --> 27:29.125
- Well, she can go to hell.

27:29.169 --> 27:30.431
- She's trying
to help you, Luis.

27:30.474 --> 27:31.693
- Help me?

27:31.737 --> 27:33.521
She worked me.

27:33.564 --> 27:35.479
She put me in cuffs.
She put me here.

27:35.523 --> 27:38.091
- No, you put you here.

27:38.134 --> 27:40.267
You just sold three kilos worth
of dope, Luis.

27:40.310 --> 27:42.704
You are the reason you're here,
and she's trying to save you.

27:42.748 --> 27:44.575
- Yeah, I don't think
this is saving me.

27:44.619 --> 27:46.403
- She gave you an out.
You didn't take it.

27:46.447 --> 27:47.796
- I--you know,
I get what you're doing.

27:47.840 --> 27:49.450
You're here to talk to me
before a lawyer comes.

27:49.493 --> 27:50.669
- Yes, because
when a lawyer comes,

27:50.712 --> 27:52.496
I can't help you.
- I don't want your help.

27:52.540 --> 27:54.324
- Yes, you do.

27:55.761 --> 27:57.719
You did three years in Menard
and Vanessa said

27:57.763 --> 27:59.068
it almost killed you.

28:00.896 --> 28:05.727
Now, I'm guessing
you don't wanna do ten years

28:05.771 --> 28:08.338
when you can do less than one.

28:09.470 --> 28:10.645
I get you're angry, but--

28:10.689 --> 28:12.821
- She lied to me...

28:12.865 --> 28:15.781
for I don't even know
how long.

28:15.824 --> 28:17.696
She looked me in the face
and she lied

28:17.739 --> 28:19.741
like I was nothing to her.

28:19.785 --> 28:23.440
- Okay.
Be mad at her.

28:23.484 --> 28:26.226
Be angry.
Don't be an idiot.

28:26.269 --> 28:29.229
Don't throw your life away...

28:29.272 --> 28:31.753
because you're pissed at her.

28:31.797 --> 28:34.495
- Pissed at her?

28:35.583 --> 28:37.759
No.

28:37.803 --> 28:40.240
I don't even know her.

28:51.164 --> 28:53.862
- I can help you now.

28:53.906 --> 28:55.864
I don't know
if I can help you later.

28:59.215 --> 29:01.783
Do you want me to call a lawyer
or do you want a deal?

29:07.310 --> 29:08.703
- Luis gave us everything.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.836
So he installs all the traps
for Gael's organization

29:10.879 --> 29:13.795
and he runs drugs,
but he gets his orders from TJ.

29:13.839 --> 29:15.449
He drops the cash
at his stash house

29:15.492 --> 29:17.277
that Gael never
actually goes to.

29:17.320 --> 29:18.626
Now, none of this
is useful to us,

29:18.669 --> 29:21.455
but he usually sees Gael
and TJ after a big re-up,

29:21.498 --> 29:22.586
usually the next day.

29:22.630 --> 29:24.197
- He said they meet
outside the bar.

29:24.240 --> 29:26.199
Gael likes to confirm
that his cash was dropped.

29:26.242 --> 29:27.766
- As in verbal confirmation?

29:27.809 --> 29:29.071
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

29:29.115 --> 29:31.726
- All right, so get Luis
to drop the cash now,

29:31.770 --> 29:33.815
then we'll move on
in the morning.

29:35.861 --> 29:38.515
This is Hank Voight.

29:38.559 --> 29:41.257
- You need to get
Gael and TJ talking.

29:41.301 --> 29:44.739
We need Gael to reference
the cash or the drugs directly.

29:44.783 --> 29:47.220
- You've explained it
to me six times.

29:47.263 --> 29:49.570
I get it.
- Okay.

29:49.613 --> 29:51.615
Do that up.

29:56.316 --> 29:58.231
- How long has she worked here?

30:00.668 --> 30:02.452
- About eight months.

30:08.241 --> 30:10.460
She was pulled
from the academy.

30:10.504 --> 30:12.723
Worked undercover
and then was placed here.

30:15.726 --> 30:18.338
This unit is considered
the most elite in CPD.

30:22.342 --> 30:24.692
All right, good to go.

30:50.413 --> 30:53.329
- Luis said usually
before ten, right?

30:53.373 --> 30:55.941
- He did, but he said
Gael and TJ vary.

31:03.557 --> 31:04.906
- They're late.

31:04.950 --> 31:06.647
- It's way too early
to call it.

31:06.690 --> 31:07.909
They'll be here.

31:11.870 --> 31:15.395
- Can we get another check
on TJ's vehicle?

31:15.438 --> 31:16.613
- Hasn't moved, Sarge.

31:16.657 --> 31:18.659
Still anchored
three blocks away.

31:22.750 --> 31:24.970
Whoa, where are
the other trackers?

31:25.013 --> 31:26.710
- What the--

31:28.321 --> 31:30.714
- Hell no.
You gotta be kidding me.

31:30.758 --> 31:34.370
- Sarge, we got a problem.
The cells just went down.

31:34.414 --> 31:36.764
- What do you mean,
"The cells just went down"?

31:36.807 --> 31:38.070
- They're off.

31:38.113 --> 31:39.288
Every single one of them
just turned off

31:39.332 --> 31:40.768
and we lost the feed
on all the trackers

31:40.811 --> 31:43.684
except for TJ's.

31:43.727 --> 31:45.947
- The whole wire's down.

31:45.991 --> 31:50.517
- All right, somebody get me
eyes on TJ's car now.

31:59.482 --> 32:02.442
- TJ, shut off your car now!

32:02.485 --> 32:04.487
- Chicago PD!

32:06.489 --> 32:07.926
Hailey, blood.

32:17.848 --> 32:19.546
- Looks like they found
the tracker.

32:22.114 --> 32:25.769
- We got TJ.
He's dead.

32:25.813 --> 32:28.511
Multiple gunshot wounds
to the head.

32:28.555 --> 32:31.645
Look, Gael's made us.
He's tying off loose ends.

32:31.688 --> 32:33.690
He's not coming.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.697
- We gotta move on him now.
He's on to us.

32:40.741 --> 32:42.003
He's disappearing.

32:42.047 --> 32:43.526
- You don't have enough
for a case against Gael.

32:43.570 --> 32:46.181
- We have the wire.
- The wire's a good start,

32:46.225 --> 32:48.923
but you can't corroborate
it's Gael at the head.

32:48.967 --> 32:51.186
You needed to catch him
with the drugs

32:51.230 --> 32:52.318
or giving an order,

32:52.361 --> 32:54.146
something that
directly connected him

32:54.189 --> 32:56.278
to the organization,
otherwise there's no case.

32:56.322 --> 32:59.586
- Okay, what about
a warrant for his house?

32:59.629 --> 33:01.327
His cars?

33:03.242 --> 33:05.853
Any of it?

33:07.376 --> 33:09.291
- This guy's dropping bodies,

33:09.335 --> 33:10.597
and he'll continue
dropping them.

33:10.640 --> 33:12.381
Anyone he thinks is associated
with the police,

33:12.425 --> 33:14.122
he will dump them like trash.

33:14.166 --> 33:15.645
He dumped his girlfriend
into a vat of acid.

33:15.689 --> 33:18.257
You know what
that'll do to a body?

33:18.300 --> 33:20.389
- Hailey...

33:22.435 --> 33:24.089
- We need to move on him.

33:25.438 --> 33:29.137
- You can't.
You don't have it.

33:32.010 --> 33:33.663
- Okay, so what about Luis?

33:33.707 --> 33:35.622
- He doesn't have
enough specific information

33:35.665 --> 33:37.145
to get you far.
- No.

33:37.189 --> 33:40.627
What about Luis's deal?
The kid kept up his end of it.

33:49.114 --> 33:51.464
- What's the verdict?

33:51.507 --> 33:53.509
- We don't have him.

33:55.990 --> 33:58.036
So loop in Homicide
on TJ's death.

33:58.079 --> 34:00.951
Maybe there's a slip up,
some way to pin it to Gael.

34:02.518 --> 34:04.042
- And the wire?

34:05.434 --> 34:07.349
- I don't know how he made us.

34:07.393 --> 34:08.698
Probably had checks
and balances

34:08.742 --> 34:10.178
in the cash
we didn't know about.

34:12.615 --> 34:15.053
- Okay, let's start
breaking down the room.

34:15.096 --> 34:16.967
Get everything we got
over to narcotics.

34:17.011 --> 34:19.579
Might be a use next time
someone takes a run at him.

34:28.109 --> 34:30.546
- We weren't able to show
Luis's cooperation was enough.

34:30.590 --> 34:32.331
- Wait, so Luis isn't
getting the deal?

34:39.251 --> 34:40.948
- I can tell him.
- No.

34:43.168 --> 34:44.517
It should be me.

34:50.523 --> 34:52.699
No, there was nothing else
we could do.

34:54.744 --> 34:57.399
Patrol will be up here soon,
bring you to booking.

34:57.443 --> 35:00.576
It's, uh--it's out of
our hands after that.

35:04.624 --> 35:08.584
You know, I never mattered
to anyone growing up.

35:10.195 --> 35:12.197
Not until I met you.

35:15.200 --> 35:18.246
You know, I took this job
because of that.

35:18.290 --> 35:21.641
I wanted to matter--
my life to matter.

35:23.121 --> 35:26.733
Luis, I wanted to tell you
so many times,

35:26.776 --> 35:29.083
and whenever I would get
close to saying it,

35:29.127 --> 35:31.607
it's like I would go silent,

35:31.651 --> 35:35.089
because I knew
I couldn't have both.

35:35.133 --> 35:39.180
I knew I would lose you
and I couldn't lose you.

35:42.705 --> 35:45.491
Luis, just please
say something.

35:49.103 --> 35:51.279
- What can I say?

35:51.323 --> 35:54.413
You're not wrong.
You don't have me.

35:55.762 --> 35:58.156
I can't be your person anymore.

36:01.420 --> 36:04.640
What we had is gone.

36:27.707 --> 36:29.187
I thought we were going
to booking.

36:29.230 --> 36:30.623
- Eventually.

36:31.711 --> 36:33.191
There's no cameras down here,

36:33.234 --> 36:35.149
and I'll deny this conversation
ever happened,

36:35.193 --> 36:36.324
but I need you
to give me more details

36:36.368 --> 36:37.499
on the traps you install.

36:37.543 --> 36:38.848
- What kind of details?

36:38.892 --> 36:41.242
- Which car of Gael's
did you install the trap in?

36:41.286 --> 36:43.244
Make, model,
where and when he drives it,

36:43.288 --> 36:45.203
the exact location of the trap,
and how to get inside it.

36:45.246 --> 36:46.682
- It won't work.

36:46.726 --> 36:48.771
Gael never drives his car
with anything illegal in it.

36:48.815 --> 36:51.557
- That doesn't matter.

36:51.600 --> 36:53.385
- What are you saying?

36:53.428 --> 36:55.517
- I'm saying
that doesn't matter.

37:57.840 --> 37:59.799
You wanted to see me?

38:00.974 --> 38:02.628
- Shut the door.

38:09.635 --> 38:11.637
Sit down.

38:15.510 --> 38:17.643
I just heard from Becerra.

38:19.558 --> 38:22.822
Patrol found two keys of dope
in the trap in Gael's car...

38:26.347 --> 38:28.349
And she's gonna use our wire
to build the case.

38:28.393 --> 38:31.309
Should be a slam dunk.

38:31.352 --> 38:33.876
Oh, and Luis,

38:33.920 --> 38:35.530
he's gonna get
the one-year deal

38:35.574 --> 38:37.924
in exchange for
corroborating evidence, so...

38:39.708 --> 38:41.319
- That's great.
Finally caught a break.

38:41.362 --> 38:43.625
- Yeah.

38:49.370 --> 38:51.241
So this is something
we're doing now?

38:53.853 --> 38:56.725
Planting dope?
Creating evidence?

38:58.466 --> 38:59.902
- If product was
found in his car,

38:59.946 --> 39:01.556
it was his own product.

39:01.600 --> 39:04.211
- And you think
that makes it better?

39:04.254 --> 39:06.561
Huh?

39:06.605 --> 39:09.477
- Gael got off easy.
Luis deserved the deal.

39:10.913 --> 39:13.220
- Hailey, I understand
why you did it.

39:13.263 --> 39:15.265
I'm not stupid.

39:16.963 --> 39:19.966
Do you understand
you crossed the line?

39:22.272 --> 39:25.450
Do you?

39:26.712 --> 39:30.629
- Hailey, the problem
with crossing lines...

39:30.672 --> 39:32.935
You cross enough of them,
you forget where they are.

39:35.329 --> 39:37.679
You don't see them anymore.

39:37.723 --> 39:40.856
- I'm seeing just fine, sir.
- Yeah, okay.

39:40.900 --> 39:43.250
Well, take a look at this.

39:44.425 --> 39:46.384
New York's FBI task force
is looking

39:46.427 --> 39:48.386
for a loan out officer.

39:50.083 --> 39:53.782
I just signed you up.
- What?

39:53.826 --> 39:55.915
- It's an assignment
for a few weeks.

39:55.958 --> 39:59.005
Believe me,
they do things different there.

39:59.048 --> 40:03.009
The lines,
they are real clear.

40:03.052 --> 40:05.707
- I did the same thing
you would have done.

40:05.751 --> 40:08.014
- I don't want you to be me!

40:08.057 --> 40:09.711
That's my job!

40:09.755 --> 40:13.454
Your job is to be you!

40:18.546 --> 40:20.983
Hailey, I'm starting
to wonder if you can do it.

40:44.485 --> 40:45.965
All right,
Platt's got the details.

40:46.008 --> 40:47.923
Flight leaves tomorrow.

40:52.711 --> 40:54.495
Have a safe trip.
