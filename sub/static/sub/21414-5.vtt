00:07.694 --> 00:09.944
( theme music playing )

00:33.570 --> 00:35.777
( music playing )

00:40.736 --> 00:42.736
( line ringing )

00:48.111 --> 00:50.944
- ( beeps )
- Woman: Hi, this is Divya.

00:50.944 --> 00:53.694
Please leave a message.
Thank you.

00:53.694 --> 00:55.445
- ( beeps )
- Mom!

00:55.445 --> 00:56.694
You gotta pick up.

00:56.694 --> 00:58.944
Okay? I've got
some crazy news.

00:58.944 --> 01:01.111
I got a callback
from an agency.

01:01.111 --> 01:03.944
Like a real
novelist agency, okay?

01:03.944 --> 01:07.445
I have a meeting
in New York on Friday.

01:07.445 --> 01:10.486
I mean,
this is so insane!

01:10.486 --> 01:12.320
It's crazy!
I mean...

01:12.320 --> 01:13.944
( sighs )
Okay, I just wanted
to let you know

01:13.944 --> 01:16.361
I made it all the way through.
I'm here now.

01:16.361 --> 01:19.153
I got myself
a little motel

01:19.153 --> 01:22.153
and I'm just gonna hole
myself in here

01:22.153 --> 01:23.861
and try
and finish the book.

01:23.861 --> 01:26.111
You know, that way,
in case I'm pitching the book

01:26.111 --> 01:28.777
on Friday to the agent
and he seems to like it,

01:28.777 --> 01:32.777
I can just kind of slide it
across the table

01:32.777 --> 01:36.445
and be like, "Boom,
there's my book, bitch."

01:36.445 --> 01:39.819
You know?
I mean, of course,
minus the bitch part.

01:39.819 --> 01:44.986
I mean, this is just
so crazy, right?

01:44.986 --> 01:50.445
I love you
and I will talk
to you soon.

01:50.445 --> 01:53.028
Bye.

01:53.028 --> 01:54.403
( chuckles )

01:57.528 --> 01:59.777
Man on stereo:
For a writer does not
sit around

01:59.777 --> 02:01.861
and think about writing.

02:01.861 --> 02:03.902
A writer does not talk
to his friends

02:03.902 --> 02:06.736
about when he plans
to start writing.

02:06.736 --> 02:10.736
A writer simply writes.

02:10.736 --> 02:13.694
Know that you are
a creative spirit

02:13.694 --> 02:16.194
and your voice
will flow through you

02:16.194 --> 02:19.819
if you allow the river
to flow freely.

02:19.819 --> 02:23.570
Now, turn off
this silly old man's voice

02:23.570 --> 02:26.153
and go write.

02:26.153 --> 02:28.361
( music playing )

02:33.986 --> 02:35.944
( car door closes )

02:35.944 --> 02:37.236
( button clicks )

02:47.611 --> 02:49.570
( touch tones beeping )

02:49.570 --> 02:52.486
Hey, Mom,
it's me again.

02:52.486 --> 02:57.069
I can't find my laptop.

02:57.069 --> 02:59.403
I was wondering if...

02:59.403 --> 03:01.278
Oh, God, I hope not.

03:01.278 --> 03:05.736
I was wondering
if maybe I forgot it
at your apartment.

03:07.445 --> 03:11.736
Yeah, which is not good

03:11.736 --> 03:14.736
because I'm really far.

03:14.736 --> 03:18.236
Could you just please
call me back

03:18.236 --> 03:19.736
when you get this?

03:19.736 --> 03:21.986
It's important.

03:21.986 --> 03:24.611
Okay?
Love you. Bye.

03:27.652 --> 03:31.194
Come on,
where are you?

03:31.194 --> 03:33.194
Reporter on TV:
Lesbian and gay groups
hope that having

03:33.194 --> 03:36.111
a lesbian lead character
on a TV series

03:36.111 --> 03:38.153
will make Americans
more sympathetic

03:38.153 --> 03:39.486
to their challenges.

03:39.486 --> 03:41.111
- But Alison Stewart...
- Come on, Mom.

03:41.111 --> 03:42.652
...visited the campus
in Roanoke, Virginia,

03:42.652 --> 03:44.111
and found out
that just because

03:44.111 --> 03:45.777
Ellen DeGeneres
has come out...

03:49.278 --> 03:50.278
( sighs )

03:50.278 --> 03:52.445
( birds chirping )

04:00.986 --> 04:03.361
( sighs )

04:03.361 --> 04:05.028
( chiming )

04:05.028 --> 04:06.236
- Hello?
- Divya: Anish?

04:06.236 --> 04:07.861
Mom!
Where have you been?

04:07.861 --> 04:09.570
Hi, baby.
I was at work.

04:09.570 --> 04:11.694
And then I went to the store,
then I was sleeping,

04:11.694 --> 04:13.652
and then I was watching
a very funny program on TV

04:13.652 --> 04:15.528
- about these--
- No, Mom, I called you
a million times.

04:15.528 --> 04:17.236
- Why didn't you pick up?
- Oh, it was you?

04:17.236 --> 04:19.320
I thought it was
the telemarketers calling me.

04:19.320 --> 04:21.570
( static hisses )
--ish, I have such
a hard time saying no,

04:21.570 --> 04:23.361
so I simply--
I just don't even pick up
the phone anymore.

04:23.361 --> 04:27.361
Did you not hear me yelling
into your answering machine?

04:27.361 --> 04:29.028
I have
an answering machine?

04:29.028 --> 04:32.486
Yes, Mom.
I got it for you
for your birthday, remember?

04:32.486 --> 04:36.111
- It's set up in the kitchen.
- Oh, no, I don't know how
to use it, so I just--

04:36.111 --> 04:38.403
Okay, okay, fine. I'm sorry.
Just never mind, okay?

04:38.403 --> 04:42.320
Listen, I have
a really, really important

04:42.320 --> 04:44.944
work meeting on Friday
with a publisher

04:44.944 --> 04:48.278
and I need you
to do me a favor.

04:48.278 --> 04:51.194
Okay? I think I left
my computer at your apartment.

04:51.194 --> 04:52.986
- Your computer?
- Yeah.

04:52.986 --> 04:54.652
The whole thing?

04:54.652 --> 04:58.069
- Yes, Mom, the whole thing.
- No, I don't think so.

04:58.069 --> 04:59.694
I think
I would have noticed.

04:59.694 --> 05:01.528
Why would you have brought
your whole computer

05:01.528 --> 05:04.028
- into the house?
- 'Cause I was writing on it.

05:04.028 --> 05:07.320
- Remember?
- Wait, you mean that little
black folding machine?

05:07.320 --> 05:09.111
- Yeah!
- That's your computer?

05:09.111 --> 05:12.194
- Yeah. Have you seen it?
- ( laughs ) Oh! It's so tiny.

05:12.194 --> 05:14.777
- I was thinking it was a kind
of a typewriter or little--
- No.

05:14.777 --> 05:17.111
Yeah, no, no, no,
that's my computer, Mom.

05:17.111 --> 05:19.570
Yeah, that's-- anyways,
getting back to the point,

05:19.570 --> 05:22.528
- I really need--
- You know, this is a very--
this is a little computer.

05:22.528 --> 05:25.652
- How do they make it
so little like that?
- I...

05:25.652 --> 05:27.069
- So--
- I don't know, Mom!

05:27.069 --> 05:29.069
I don't know who makes it
so little.

05:29.069 --> 05:32.069
I don't know.
But the thing is,
have you seen it?

05:32.069 --> 05:34.570
No, I have not.

05:34.570 --> 05:37.570
Well, can you go look
for it, then, please?

05:37.570 --> 05:41.111
Okay, but right now,
I'm watching TV.

05:41.111 --> 05:43.611
Mom, it's important, okay?
It's very important.

05:43.611 --> 05:45.694
( Divya crunching )

05:45.694 --> 05:46.902
- Okay.
- Okay.

05:46.902 --> 05:48.861
- Okay, baby.
- Okay.

05:48.861 --> 05:50.278
Come on.

05:57.445 --> 06:00.236
- ( loud crashing )
- Jesus.

06:12.528 --> 06:13.986
- Divya: Hi, baby.
- Yeah?

06:13.986 --> 06:15.652
No, I didn't find it,
baby.

06:15.652 --> 06:17.819
- What?
- No. I found it!

06:17.819 --> 06:19.486
- You-- Mom!
- ( laughs )

06:19.486 --> 06:21.278
Oh, I almost had
a heart attack!

06:21.278 --> 06:23.361
- No, it was right
in front of me.
- Oh, my gosh.

06:23.361 --> 06:26.570
- I just missed it.
- It was right
in front of you?

06:26.570 --> 06:28.902
I am going to put this
in the mail on Friday.

06:28.902 --> 06:30.777
- So, I'm gonna put
some books in there...
- No.

06:30.777 --> 06:32.986
- ...and get
the book rate...
- No, Mom.

06:32.986 --> 06:35.986
- Mom, shh.
Mom, please, please.
- ...it's like a suitcase.

06:35.986 --> 06:37.320
Please.
Mom? Mom?

06:37.320 --> 06:39.236
Now I'm speaking.
Thank you.

06:39.236 --> 06:41.069
You can't send it
that way, okay?

06:41.069 --> 06:42.736
Media mail, that takes
six weeks, okay?

06:42.736 --> 06:45.320
Look, I'm gonna figure out
some way to get it to me,

06:45.320 --> 06:49.069
but right now, I have
a super, super important
deadline,

06:49.069 --> 06:51.445
and I need a copy
of my book.

06:51.445 --> 06:53.153
You understand?

06:55.986 --> 06:57.736
What...

06:57.736 --> 07:00.777
- Your what?
- The book, Mom.

07:00.777 --> 07:04.153
The one that I was writing
on my computer?

07:07.320 --> 07:09.777
Divya:
Baby, how am I supposed
to get it off your computer

07:09.777 --> 07:12.486
and get it to you?
( laughs )

07:12.486 --> 07:15.694
You want me to zip it
through some time
and some space

07:15.694 --> 07:17.403
like David Copperfield?

07:17.403 --> 07:20.320
- Ha ha.
Jokes on jokes.
- ( laughing )

07:20.320 --> 07:21.986
Okay, Mom,
please stop laughing.

07:21.986 --> 07:24.320
It's not that funny.
Mom, it's not that funny.

07:24.320 --> 07:27.028
- Please, okay? Listen.
- Okay, okay, what do you
want me to do, baby?

07:27.028 --> 07:30.278
So, what we're gonna do is,
you're gonna send me an e-mail

07:30.278 --> 07:34.819
from my mail account, okay,
with a copy of my book,

07:34.819 --> 07:37.194
which is
in a Word document,

07:37.194 --> 07:40.694
which is in a folder
on my desktop.

07:40.694 --> 07:42.486
Easy, right?

07:45.111 --> 07:47.652
Divya:
Anish, I'm not understanding
what you are saying.

07:47.652 --> 07:50.111
What-- what are you
asking me to do?

07:50.111 --> 07:52.403
Okay, Mom,
all I'm asking you to do
is open up the computer.

07:52.403 --> 07:53.694
Can you do that
for me, please?

07:53.694 --> 07:55.153
Can you please open up
the computer?

07:55.153 --> 07:56.861
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Thank you.

07:56.861 --> 07:59.528
- ( rustling )
- ( Divya sighs )

07:59.528 --> 08:01.570
- Okay, got it.
- Okay, great job.

08:01.570 --> 08:04.570
Okay, now, the next thing
is the power button, okay?

08:04.570 --> 08:06.361
It has a circle on it

08:06.361 --> 08:09.445
with a line
that's halfway through.

08:09.445 --> 08:12.236
I want you to press this
and then hold it

08:12.236 --> 08:15.570
for a few seconds until
you hear a chime sound, okay?

08:15.570 --> 08:18.069
That means the computer
is starting up.

08:20.361 --> 08:22.902
- Neat.
- It worked?

08:22.902 --> 08:26.902
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah. Okay, great job!

08:26.902 --> 08:29.528
- Okay, um...
- Thanks, baby.
This is easy.

08:29.528 --> 08:31.445
Yeah, no,
you're doing great, Mom.

08:31.445 --> 08:35.403
Now, I want you to tell me
what windows are open.

08:35.403 --> 08:37.278
All the windows are closed.

08:37.278 --> 08:40.944
- It's very cold outside.
- ( whispers ) Oh, my God.

08:40.944 --> 08:45.486
Uh, Mom, I mean the windows
on  the computer,

08:45.486 --> 08:47.111
not the windows
in your apartment.

08:47.111 --> 08:49.528
Oh, I'm sorry,
baby, I'm just--

08:49.528 --> 08:51.111
that was dumb
of me, sorry.

08:51.111 --> 08:52.861
- No, Mom,
you're not dumb.
- No, I am.

08:52.861 --> 08:54.069
Stop it.
No, you're doing great.

08:54.069 --> 08:55.445
Okay, just tell me

08:55.445 --> 08:57.111
what you see
on the screen.

08:57.111 --> 09:00.736
Okay, baby, it is blue.

09:00.736 --> 09:03.944
And a group
of little blue--

09:03.944 --> 09:07.694
the squares
with tiny little words
underneath them.

09:07.694 --> 09:09.570
Yeah,
so those blue squares

09:09.570 --> 09:12.278
are actually called
folders, okay?

09:12.278 --> 09:14.111
So now, I want you
to go and find the folder

09:14.111 --> 09:17.944
that says "Gently Through
the Current."

09:17.944 --> 09:23.861
- "Gently Through
the... Current."
- Current.

09:23.861 --> 09:25.694
- What is that?
- What is what?

09:25.694 --> 09:28.111
What is "Gently Through
the Current"?

09:28.111 --> 09:31.153
Oh, that is
actually, um...

09:32.486 --> 09:36.861
It's the title
for my book.

09:36.861 --> 09:37.819
Yeah.

09:39.153 --> 09:42.278
- You like it?
- ( Divya laughs )

09:42.278 --> 09:45.777
It's not supposed
to be funny, Mom.

09:45.777 --> 09:47.278
It's a little airy-fairy.

09:47.278 --> 09:49.694
- But what does it mean?
- "Airy"...

09:49.694 --> 09:52.986
It's a metaphor, Mom,
okay?

09:52.986 --> 09:55.528
First of all,
it's a working title,
so it can change,

09:55.528 --> 09:58.153
but-- but it's a metaphor--
it's a metaphor, okay,

09:58.153 --> 10:01.236
for when you're going
where things take you

10:01.236 --> 10:04.819
and whether
that's a good thing or not.

10:04.819 --> 10:07.861
Maybe a little more
forceful, like tides.

10:07.861 --> 10:10.069
"Tides"? That--
Mom, no. It's-- that--

10:10.069 --> 10:13.570
- Tides.
- Look, Mom, it's about
societal misconceptions.

10:13.570 --> 10:16.236
That you just have
to surrender to what
your experience is.

10:16.236 --> 10:18.069
You know, so it--
( stutters )

10:18.069 --> 10:20.153
You know what,
just forget it, Mom.
You're not a critic.

10:20.153 --> 10:22.111
- Okay, you don't read
a lot of books.
- Okay.

10:22.111 --> 10:24.111
So, you-- it's not--
you wouldn't understand,
okay?

10:24.111 --> 10:26.028
Just tell me
what's on the screen.

10:26.028 --> 10:28.028
- What's on the screen?
- See, I can't read
these words.

10:28.028 --> 10:29.944
They're like little ants.

10:29.944 --> 10:32.153
But Janet next door
has a telescope.

10:32.153 --> 10:33.652
What? No.

10:33.652 --> 10:38.028
You can increase
the screen size
in preferences.

10:38.028 --> 10:39.902
Never mind.
Never mind.

10:39.902 --> 10:42.236
- Uh...
- Ah, I'm just
making a joke.

10:42.236 --> 10:44.194
- I'm not this dumb.
- You're right.

10:44.194 --> 10:47.777
Sorry.
I'm just... stressed.

10:47.777 --> 10:50.111
- Uh...
- Just tell me
what to do.

10:50.111 --> 10:54.194
Okay, so I'm 99% sure

10:54.194 --> 10:58.736
that the folder
is the fourth one down

10:58.736 --> 11:01.111
in the top
right-hand column,

11:01.111 --> 11:04.153
so double-click
that folder.

11:04.153 --> 11:06.777
Three, one...

11:06.777 --> 11:10.069
That's number one,
two...

11:12.403 --> 11:15.736
- Four-- the fourth one.
- Three, four.

11:15.736 --> 11:17.694
- Uh-huh. Yes.
- And double-click.

11:17.694 --> 11:19.652
And what double-click--
what is this?

11:19.652 --> 11:23.194
Oh, sorry, that's when
you take the mouse

11:23.194 --> 11:26.361
over the folder and then
you want to click it twice.

11:26.361 --> 11:27.777
Really fast, okay?

11:27.777 --> 11:31.403
So, like, click-click,
click-click, click-click.

11:31.403 --> 11:33.028
Yeah...

11:35.445 --> 11:37.986
- Did you click-click?
- I am just looking
out the window,

11:37.986 --> 11:40.445
and this Mr. Jenson
just has got a new car.

11:40.445 --> 11:42.611
Okay, Mom, Mom,
I need you to focus.

11:42.611 --> 11:44.570
- Okay? Please.
- I'm getting
a little tired,

11:44.570 --> 11:46.486
so why don't we just
do this tomorrow?

11:46.486 --> 11:48.486
No! Tomorrow-- Mom,
you're not understanding

11:48.486 --> 11:50.445
how important this is
for me, okay?

11:50.445 --> 11:52.777
I need my book right now
so I can write.

11:52.777 --> 11:55.278
- I've wasted hours.
I haven't written all night!
- Okay, calm down.

11:55.278 --> 11:57.944
- My meeting is on Friday!
- I don't see why you
can't just write

11:57.944 --> 11:59.986
the rest of the book
on some hotel paper

11:59.986 --> 12:02.445
- and then you could type it up
in New York City.
- Mom. Mom.

12:02.445 --> 12:05.111
What? No, I can't--
Mom, it doesn't
work that way!

12:05.111 --> 12:07.278
- Why doesn't it
work like that?
- Because I--

12:07.278 --> 12:09.736
the book
is 90% complete, okay?

12:09.736 --> 12:11.236
And I need to look
at the whole thing

12:11.236 --> 12:14.570
so that I can...
contextualize the--

12:14.570 --> 12:17.819
forget it, you're never
gonna understand.

12:17.819 --> 12:20.153
Listen, I may not know
about this computer,

12:20.153 --> 12:22.611
but the situation doesn't
seem very complicated to me.

12:22.611 --> 12:26.652
People have been writing
on notebook for thousands
of years.

12:26.652 --> 12:28.153
And you used to write
on a notebook,

12:28.153 --> 12:29.944
the ones I bought you
from the store.

12:29.944 --> 12:32.694
You wrote such good stories
on just plain notebooks.

12:32.694 --> 12:34.652
Mom, those were
stupid stories.

12:34.652 --> 12:37.486
The one about the dinosaur
from the future?

12:37.486 --> 12:38.819
I love that story.

12:38.819 --> 12:40.944
That was one
of your best stories.

12:40.944 --> 12:43.153
Oh, my goodness, I--
honestly, I don't know why

12:43.153 --> 12:45.236
you don't try to sell
this dinosaur story

12:45.236 --> 12:46.777
in your big meeting.

12:46.777 --> 12:48.611
Because I wrote that story
when I was 13.

12:48.611 --> 12:50.986
I thought
it was wonderful, baby.

12:50.986 --> 12:54.028
What a nice title, too.

12:54.028 --> 12:56.486
Nice ti-- Mom, it was
called "Future Dinosaur."

12:56.486 --> 12:58.403
- Yes, exactly.
- ( sighs )

12:58.403 --> 13:01.194
This way, you know
what the story is about
right away.

13:01.194 --> 13:02.819
Crack.

13:02.819 --> 13:04.028
- Mom?
- Yes?

13:04.028 --> 13:05.652
I'm gonna ask you
this once.

13:05.652 --> 13:07.445
I want you
to answer honestly.

13:07.445 --> 13:08.736
Are you trying
to say something

13:08.736 --> 13:09.861
about the title
of my book?

13:09.861 --> 13:12.028
No.

13:12.028 --> 13:13.944
- I don't understand it,
that's all I'm saying.
- See, there--

13:13.944 --> 13:16.194
so, that's--
so, you are trying
to say something.

13:16.194 --> 13:19.028
Why don't you just answer me
when I ask you a question
straightforward--

13:19.028 --> 13:20.777
Mom, you know what,
just forget it.

13:20.777 --> 13:22.028
I don't expect you
to understand.

13:22.028 --> 13:23.652
Baby, I wish
you would stop

13:23.652 --> 13:25.486
talking to me
like I'm a dummy, Anish.

13:25.486 --> 13:28.236
Mom, I just need you
to double-click

13:28.236 --> 13:29.819
- on the document, please.
- Okay, fine, fine.

13:29.819 --> 13:32.403
- Thank you.
- Okay, okay, okay, fine.

13:32.403 --> 13:35.694
- ( whispers ) Oh, my God.
- ( clicking )

13:35.694 --> 13:37.819
Nothing's happening.

13:37.819 --> 13:39.861
Mom, you need
to click it really fast,

13:39.861 --> 13:41.278
like twice in a row.

13:41.278 --> 13:43.611
Like super fast,
like click-click.

13:43.611 --> 13:45.736
( clicking continues )

13:46.986 --> 13:48.902
No, Mom--
( scoffs ) oh, fuck.

13:48.902 --> 13:50.403
I don't think
this is working.

13:50.403 --> 13:51.944
Mom, because you're not
doing it fast enough.

13:51.944 --> 13:54.570
- I can hear the--
- Oh!

13:54.570 --> 13:57.153
What was that "Oh"?

13:57.153 --> 13:59.611
Wait, there's some--
it came.

13:59.611 --> 14:01.486
It ca--
so many words.

14:01.486 --> 14:02.902
- Okay, yeah.
- Oh, there's so many pa--

14:02.902 --> 14:04.486
did you write
all these words?

14:04.486 --> 14:05.944
Yeah, Mom,
that's my book, okay?

14:05.944 --> 14:07.570
Now, this is great.
Okay, this is great.

14:07.570 --> 14:08.986
We're almost done, okay?
We're almost done.

14:08.986 --> 14:10.403
So, now all
we're gonna do is,

14:10.403 --> 14:12.570
we're gonna copy
that whole thing, okay,

14:12.570 --> 14:14.445
and then we're gonna paste it
into an e-mail,

14:14.445 --> 14:16.361
then you're gonna fire up
my modem,

14:16.361 --> 14:18.736
and then you're gonna send me
the e-mail, and that's it.

14:18.736 --> 14:20.777
- We're done.
After that, we're done.
- ( groaning ) No, no, no.

14:20.777 --> 14:24.652
- We're done.
- Okay, that sounds like
too much to do.

14:24.652 --> 14:28.403
No, no, Mom, Mom, Mom,
I'm gonna guide you through
the whole thing, okay?

14:28.403 --> 14:29.819
It's gonna be
really easy.

14:29.819 --> 14:31.236
Okay, so now,
what I want you to do

14:31.236 --> 14:32.986
is I want you
to look at the keyboard,

14:32.986 --> 14:35.153
right, and find
the "A" button

14:35.153 --> 14:36.944
and the "Command" button.

14:36.944 --> 14:39.278
"Command."
Yeah, I see this.

14:39.278 --> 14:41.611
Good! Good, okay, so now,
I just want you to press

14:41.611 --> 14:44.528
both these buttons
at the same time.

14:44.528 --> 14:45.944
- Okay, can you do that
for me?
- Okay.

14:45.944 --> 14:48.320
At the same time.

14:48.320 --> 14:49.278
Yeah.

14:51.236 --> 14:52.944
- Uh-oh.
- Wait, what do you
mean "Uh-oh"?

14:52.944 --> 14:56.069
No, I don't know.
It says, um...

14:56.069 --> 14:58.278
there's some cloud
that's come over these words,

14:58.278 --> 14:59.986
- like...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:59.986 --> 15:01.570
like a highlighter,
everything--

15:01.570 --> 15:03.403
Uh-huh, I get-- I know
what you're saying, Mom.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.236
That-- actually,
that's a really good thing.

15:05.236 --> 15:09.528
That's...
exactly what we want
to happen, okay?

15:09.528 --> 15:12.028
- Because that means
you've selected all, okay?
- I did it.

15:12.028 --> 15:14.486
Okay, so now
I just want you to look
at the keyboard again,

15:14.486 --> 15:15.861
find the "C" button

15:15.861 --> 15:18.486
and press that
with the "Command" button,

15:18.486 --> 15:20.819
and then that's going
to copy all of it, okay?

15:20.819 --> 15:22.445
It's gonna copy
the whole book.

15:26.153 --> 15:28.570
Mom, talk to me.
What's going on?

15:28.570 --> 15:33.320
Sooo, yeah, I don't think
anything happened.

15:33.320 --> 15:35.486
- Um...
- What do you mean?
What does that mean?

15:35.486 --> 15:37.694
- What do you mean--
- Well, I don't know.
( stammering )

15:37.694 --> 15:40.278
Everything just sort of--
it just went away.

15:40.278 --> 15:42.861
- ( breathing heavily )
- You see, there were
all these words,

15:42.861 --> 15:45.986
you know, before,
and now it's empty.

15:48.736 --> 15:50.902
( stammering )
What do you mean, "empty"?

15:50.902 --> 15:53.694
Uh, the words are gone.

15:57.777 --> 16:00.694
Okay, okay.

16:00.694 --> 16:03.528
Now, Mom, I need you
to be very careful

16:03.528 --> 16:04.986
from this moment onwards

16:04.986 --> 16:08.194
and listen to me
very carefully, okay?

16:08.194 --> 16:09.986
What buttons
did you press?

16:09.986 --> 16:12.528
I-- I pressed what
you told me to press.

16:12.528 --> 16:16.694
- Which is what?
- "Command" and "V" together.

16:18.236 --> 16:20.528
No, not "Command V," Mom.

16:20.528 --> 16:23.528
- I said, "Command C"!
- Hey, this is not
what you said.

16:23.528 --> 16:25.361
Okay, Mom.
Mom, okay, listen.

16:25.361 --> 16:27.819
You've gotta listen to me
very carefully, okay?

16:27.819 --> 16:29.736
So, you just pasted
over my whole book,

16:29.736 --> 16:31.694
which means you basically
deleted the whole thing.

16:31.694 --> 16:33.570
So, so, right now,
we need to be

16:33.570 --> 16:36.570
extremely  careful
and don't touch anything

16:36.570 --> 16:38.902
until I tell you exactly
what to do, okay?

16:38.902 --> 16:40.819
( chopping sounds )

16:40.819 --> 16:43.111
- Mom!
- No, I don't
like this tone.

16:43.111 --> 16:45.819
- Mom, just listen to me
for one second.
- Tone.

16:45.819 --> 16:48.361
Mom, enough with
this tone bullshit, okay?

16:48.361 --> 16:50.570
Okay? You just pasted over
my whole book,

16:50.570 --> 16:53.320
and I need to do something
to recover it before it's
permanently deleted.

16:53.320 --> 16:54.736
I'm sorry, young man,

16:54.736 --> 16:57.194
if you use this tone
with me one more time,

16:57.194 --> 16:59.320
I'm going to hang up
with you straightaway.

16:59.320 --> 17:00.819
No. No, no, no.
Okay, don't hang up.

17:00.819 --> 17:02.445
Don't hang up,
don't hang up.

17:02.445 --> 17:03.736
Okay, just--

17:03.736 --> 17:07.570
Mom, just press
"Command Z."

17:07.570 --> 17:10.486
- That's the undo function.
- ( chopping continues )

17:10.486 --> 17:14.570
- ( Divya mutters )
- Mom, if you chop one more
fucking vegetable,

17:14.570 --> 17:15.986
I swear to God.

17:15.986 --> 17:18.944
Please press "Command Z."

17:18.944 --> 17:20.944
Do not use
that language with me,

17:20.944 --> 17:22.694
and please apologize
if you want me

17:22.694 --> 17:24.819
- to press anything.
- ( whispers ) Fuck!

17:24.819 --> 17:27.194
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry.

17:27.194 --> 17:29.069
Not "I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry."

17:29.069 --> 17:32.111
- Not like that. Really.
- ( breathing heavily )

17:32.111 --> 17:35.111
- Mom--
- No! Really.

17:35.111 --> 17:37.445
I am so sorry.

17:37.445 --> 17:39.777
I am so sorry.

17:39.777 --> 17:43.111
Please, can you press
"Command Z"?

17:43.111 --> 17:44.445
Okay, fine.

17:45.611 --> 17:47.361
Wait.

17:47.361 --> 17:49.153
Okay, did the words
come back?

17:49.153 --> 17:51.361
Wait.

17:51.361 --> 17:53.320
No, it didn't do
anything.

17:53.320 --> 17:56.153
- What do you mean
it didn't do any--
- Oh, wait, wait, wait.

17:56.153 --> 18:00.069
There's a little bubble here
that says save--

18:00.069 --> 18:02.403
- No, so don't press
that button, because--
- Well, let me just...

18:02.403 --> 18:04.777
No, no, no, Mom, you can't
save the wrong document.

18:04.777 --> 18:07.445
- It's a deleted document.
- Baby, I'm just saving it
for you.

18:07.445 --> 18:09.153
No, Mom, don't save it.
That's what I'm saying.

18:09.153 --> 18:11.486
- Don't save it!
- Okay, baby, it's saved.

18:15.278 --> 18:18.320
The words are still gone,
though.

18:19.486 --> 18:20.986
Huh.

18:20.986 --> 18:22.986
Huh... huh.

18:25.986 --> 18:30.320
Mom, I want you to close
my computer right now.

18:30.320 --> 18:32.944
Uh, you don't want me
to e-mail this to you?

18:32.944 --> 18:34.652
Just shut up.

18:34.652 --> 18:38.736
Just shut up for one second,
and listen to me.

18:38.736 --> 18:40.861
I want you
to close my computer,

18:40.861 --> 18:42.861
I want you to get
on the fucking bus,

18:42.861 --> 18:46.028
and I want you to go
to the Mac World
on 17th Street,

18:46.028 --> 18:48.528
hand my computer to the guy
who's in the store,

18:48.528 --> 18:53.028
give him my number
and have him call me
immediately.

18:53.028 --> 18:56.902
And I need you to do this
right fucking now!

19:02.611 --> 19:04.486
Divya:
No.

19:04.486 --> 19:06.361
- "No"?
- You heard me.

19:06.361 --> 19:08.361
You think I'm gonna sit here
and do anything

19:08.361 --> 19:10.236
for anyone who speaks to me
like this?

19:10.236 --> 19:12.194
Mom, you just deleted
my fucking book.

19:12.194 --> 19:14.028
( Divya speaking
foreign language )

19:14.028 --> 19:15.652
Where is your language?
What is this tone?

19:15.652 --> 19:18.069
I don't give a fuck
about my fucking tone

19:18.069 --> 19:20.361
and my fucking language,
okay?

19:20.361 --> 19:22.236
Can you just--
you deleted my life's work!

19:22.236 --> 19:23.902
- Don't you understand that?
- What life's work?

19:23.902 --> 19:26.194
That's everything
I've been working on, Mom!

19:26.194 --> 19:28.486
You're being so dramatic.
Life work, life work--
what is life work?

19:28.486 --> 19:31.652
I just accidentally deleted
some... stuff-- dumb words.

19:31.652 --> 19:33.236
Don't call my words dumb

19:33.236 --> 19:35.570
just 'cause you don't
understand them, okay?

19:35.570 --> 19:38.361
They're meant
for people that can actually
understand English.

19:38.361 --> 19:41.819
( stammering )
You think that I'm dumb,
an uneducated mommy?

19:41.819 --> 19:43.528
- Mom.
- That I can't
possibly understand?

19:43.528 --> 19:45.069
You know what?
I understand what it takes

19:45.069 --> 19:47.736
to raise a child
with absolutely nothing.

19:47.736 --> 19:49.902
Working two jobs
to support you,

19:49.902 --> 19:53.278
get you this college education
so you can make something
of yourself.

19:53.278 --> 19:56.361
And then your son comes home
and treats you like
you're the enemy.

19:56.361 --> 19:57.736
And why?

19:57.736 --> 19:59.403
Because he spends
four years and $50,000

19:59.403 --> 20:02.236
at some university
not becoming a doctor,

20:02.236 --> 20:05.278
not becoming a lawyer,
but just reading and
talking about books

20:05.278 --> 20:07.736
that he could've
just done for free
in the library instead.

20:07.736 --> 20:09.403
You don't think
I understand?

20:09.403 --> 20:11.445
Okay, you don't try
to guilt-trip me
right now, okay?

20:11.445 --> 20:12.944
'Cause you're always trying
to make me somebody

20:12.944 --> 20:14.777
that I'm not, okay, Mom?

20:14.777 --> 20:16.652
I'm not gonna be a lawyer,
I'm not gonna be a doctor, okay?

20:16.652 --> 20:18.445
I have my own dreams.

20:18.445 --> 20:20.278
I'm sorry if that's too hard
for you to deal with, okay?

20:20.278 --> 20:22.320
I'm sorry that I wasn't
some perfect son

20:22.320 --> 20:23.986
who could climb
some social ladder

20:23.986 --> 20:26.694
and save you from
your sad, unhappy life.

20:26.694 --> 20:28.944
Okay?
You've never seen me.

20:28.944 --> 20:31.403
- No, baby,
I see exactly who you are.
- You never see who I am.

20:31.403 --> 20:33.445
No, you don't, Mom.
You just see what you
want me to be.

20:33.445 --> 20:35.986
- But I just want you
to be somebody!
- ( scoffs )

20:35.986 --> 20:38.028
What do you think
I'm trying to do, Mom?
I'm trying to be somebody.

20:38.028 --> 20:39.611
- I'm writing a book.
- You do not!

20:39.611 --> 20:41.153
- I'm moving to New York.
- You do not!

20:41.153 --> 20:42.819
You do not listen.
You are stubborn.

20:42.819 --> 20:45.819
- You're just like her.
- Like who?

20:47.361 --> 20:49.694
- Huh?
- You sai--
"Just like her"?

20:49.694 --> 20:51.944
- Like who? What are you--
- No, nothing, nothing.

20:51.944 --> 20:55.445
Nothing. You forget--
forget about all this.

20:55.445 --> 20:56.777
( Divya crying )

20:56.777 --> 20:58.403
I'm sorry about
your book, okay?

20:58.403 --> 21:00.652
I'm gonna take your computer
to the bus,

21:00.652 --> 21:04.361
I'm gonna give it--
I'm gonna give that book
to your bus man

21:04.361 --> 21:08.986
and I'm gonna tell him...
to-- I'm gonna tell him...

21:08.986 --> 21:10.944
Mom? Mom?

21:10.944 --> 21:12.986
I'm gonna tell him
to call you...

21:12.986 --> 21:16.611
- Mom? Mom?
- ...and I'm sorry--
I'm sorry about the book.

21:16.611 --> 21:19.736
Mom, what's--
what's going on
right now?

21:19.736 --> 21:22.986
Are-- Mom, Mom,
listen, listen, listen.

21:22.986 --> 21:25.861
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

21:25.861 --> 21:27.153
Okay?

21:27.153 --> 21:29.486
Don't cry, okay?
I'm sorry.

21:29.486 --> 21:32.736
( crying continues )
Baby, her name was Vetha.

21:32.736 --> 21:35.611
And she was...

21:35.611 --> 21:37.861
( sniffles )
and she was 19.

21:37.861 --> 21:40.361
- Who?
- ( sobbing )

21:40.361 --> 21:43.028
She was raised by--
by very nice parents,

21:43.028 --> 21:44.652
but they were poor.

21:44.652 --> 21:48.069
And the girl, she just
went through so much trouble

21:48.069 --> 21:49.986
with school
and then the drinking

21:49.986 --> 21:52.153
and then the drugs
and then the boys.

21:52.153 --> 21:56.153
She was so smart,
and I tried to help her out

21:56.153 --> 21:57.694
and I tried
to cook for her

21:57.694 --> 22:00.278
and I tried to care for her
when I could.

22:00.278 --> 22:02.236
And then when
this baby comes,

22:02.236 --> 22:05.028
her parents just--
they cut her off

22:05.028 --> 22:08.570
and they move away quickly
from the shame.

22:08.570 --> 22:10.153
So, she stayed with me

22:10.153 --> 22:13.611
and I helped take care
of this little, fat baby boy.

22:13.611 --> 22:17.028
And we were-- you know,
we were some-- family somehow

22:17.028 --> 22:21.736
until one day, I woke up
and she was gone,

22:21.736 --> 22:24.069
and I never
saw her again.

22:24.069 --> 22:28.611
And I have this baby boy
who's not even one year old.

22:28.611 --> 22:34.403
Then I knew-- I knew
that this boy would be mine.

22:34.403 --> 22:36.694
( sobbing )

22:38.736 --> 22:40.736
( exhaling )

22:48.403 --> 22:50.777
Mom, um...

22:50.777 --> 22:56.445
I'm trying to understand
what you're saying.

22:56.445 --> 22:58.652
( sniffles )

22:58.652 --> 23:02.902
Are you saying
that I'm adopted?

23:05.320 --> 23:07.986
( Divya sighs )

23:07.986 --> 23:10.736
Yes.

23:10.736 --> 23:13.320
Okay.

23:13.320 --> 23:16.028
And you decided
to tell me this

23:16.028 --> 23:21.736
right after you deleted
my life's work on my computer?

23:24.986 --> 23:27.986
( Divya laughs )
I'm sorry, baby.

23:27.986 --> 23:31.611
I'm just--
oh, it just slipped out.

23:33.486 --> 23:35.486
Also, you're technically
Pakistani,

23:35.486 --> 23:39.902
- but it's not
a big deal, I think.
- ( sighs )

23:39.902 --> 23:42.694
No, it's not.

23:42.694 --> 23:44.986
My baby, I'm sorry

23:44.986 --> 23:50.819
this is happening like this,
but I want to say that...

23:50.819 --> 23:53.611
I know that
you're not actually from me

23:53.611 --> 23:56.320
and that you are
actually not like me,

23:56.320 --> 24:01.570
and that you're right,
that I don't understand

24:01.570 --> 24:03.986
what you think
and what you do...

24:05.819 --> 24:07.694
but you are my son.

24:09.194 --> 24:12.528
- And I love you very much.
- ( crying )

24:16.111 --> 24:18.694
( both crying )

24:18.694 --> 24:21.028
Mom?

24:21.028 --> 24:24.652
- Mama? Mom? Mama?
- I'll go, I'll get
this computer...

24:24.652 --> 24:26.570
- Mom, Mama.
- ...to the Mac World,

24:26.570 --> 24:29.611
and now we can see
if we can just fix it
for you, okay?

24:29.611 --> 24:33.819
Mom, I'm scared
that my book is not good.

24:33.819 --> 24:36.736
Oh, oh, no,
that's okay, baby.

24:36.736 --> 24:38.528
You can write a new one.

24:38.528 --> 24:41.902
And I'm gonna get
this one back to you, okay?

24:41.902 --> 24:43.403
Just in case.
Okay, my baby?

24:43.403 --> 24:45.652
I'm gonna make sure
that they get

24:45.652 --> 24:48.153
this one
back to you, okay?

24:49.570 --> 24:52.902
- Okay.
- Oh, sorry, baby.

24:52.902 --> 24:55.236
- Oh.
- Will you call me
afterwards?

24:55.236 --> 24:56.652
I'll call you, my baby.

24:56.652 --> 24:59.736
Of course
I'll call you, baby.

24:59.736 --> 25:02.528
- Thank you.
- Aw...

25:02.528 --> 25:04.194
I love you, Mom.

25:05.736 --> 25:07.736
I love you, too,
my baby boy.

25:07.736 --> 25:09.236
( crying )

25:14.069 --> 25:16.320
Love-- okay,
I'm going now, okay?

25:16.320 --> 25:19.528
- Bye.
- Okay,  raja,
you eat, okay?

25:19.528 --> 25:20.777
You eat something, okay?

25:20.777 --> 25:25.111
- Bye.
- ( sighs ) Okay.
