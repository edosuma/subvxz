09:17.090 --> 09:19.858
Little triangle windows
that weren't good for nothing.

09:19.860 --> 09:24.095
And a front seat you could fit
all your newborn babies on.

Oh, thank you.

09:58.432 --> 10:01.733
You've taken my dad
back to a simpler time

10:01.735 --> 10:06.037
when our only worry was being
obliterated by nuclear weapons.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.539
It is the car.

10:07.541 --> 10:11.142
All our American cars
were built before 1960.

10:11.144 --> 10:15.046
And studies show that exposure
to objects from your youth

10:15.048 --> 10:17.048

10:17.050 --> 10:18.283

Are they peer reviewed?

10:19.620 --> 10:20.785
You know what they are?

10:20.787 --> 10:23.722
A professor, Ellen
Langer, did a study

10:23.724 --> 10:27.158
where seniors exposed
to culture from the '50s

10:27.160 --> 10:29.327
became more vigorous
and engaged.

10:29.329 --> 10:32.731
They even engaged
in heavy petting.

10:32.733 --> 10:34.733
There's<i> heavy</i> petting?

without flatlining.

10:42.476 --> 10:46.177

11:03.797 --> 11:06.598
This paladar is a restaurant,

11:06.600 --> 11:08.299

11:08.301 --> 11:09.501

to do the dishes?

Is there anything
I get out of this?

18:28.241 --> 18:30.775
Yes. You avoid
the knockout gas.

18:30.777 --> 18:31.809
Aw.

18:31.811 --> 18:33.444
(gas hissing)

18:34.581 --> 18:36.380
Oh, thank God.

18:36.382 --> 18:38.783
Usually I can never sleep
on planes.

18:38.785 --> 18:41.285
Sometimes I...
(weak groaning)

18:41.287 --> 18:42.553
(thump)

18:48.394 --> 18:49.760
(loud buzzing)

18:49.762 --> 18:52.563
(flamingos honking)

18:52.565 --> 18:56.434
So, that's the end
of my Cuban paradise.

18:56.436 --> 18:58.302
And like every good
thing in my life,

18:58.304 --> 19:00.104
I've already
forgotten it.

19:00.106 --> 19:03.441
Listen, Dad, I know it was fun,
but your place is with us,

19:03.443 --> 19:05.776
not on some island
in the Indian Ocean.

19:05.778 --> 19:07.345
I love you.

19:07.347 --> 19:09.847
(both sobbing)

19:12.252 --> 19:15.253
Oh, now we're
two men hugging.

19:15.255 --> 19:18.489
This is no sight
for the streets of Miami.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.525
(both sobbing)

19:20.527 --> 19:22.126
Hey, Dad.

19:22.128 --> 19:23.828
It's a beautiful day.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.463
Want to hit the links?

19:25.465 --> 19:28.099
Oh, just like we used to.

19:30.703 --> 19:32.203
(horn blows)

19:32.205 --> 19:33.171
(laughter)

19:33.173 --> 19:35.239
Screw you!

19:38.778 --> 19:40.178
(horn blows)

19:40.180 --> 19:41.679
(horn blows)

19:41.681 --> 19:43.247
Look over there.

19:45.451 --> 19:47.485
I just painted
a black circle on the green.

19:47.487 --> 19:49.020
MAN:
Why, you little...!

19:49.022 --> 19:51.088
(laughter)

19:53.193 --> 19:54.625
(laughter continues)

19:54.627 --> 19:56.694
(grunting):
Hey!

19:57.797 --> 20:00.331
Now, boy, it's 50 cents
a golf ball

20:00.333 --> 20:02.200
from that water hazard.

20:02.202 --> 20:04.769
Just move those logs aside.

20:10.243 --> 20:11.876
TV ANNOUNCER:
<i>Next on</i> Vulture's Nest...

20:11.878 --> 20:14.011
We all know TV dinners,

20:14.013 --> 20:17.181
but what about
toilet breakfasts?

20:17.183 --> 20:18.816
Here's my offer-- no money,

20:18.818 --> 20:20.685
and I get a hundred percent
of the company

20:20.687 --> 20:24.322
because there's no doubt you
developed this idea on my time.

20:24.324 --> 20:25.423
And there's more!

20:25.425 --> 20:27.692
