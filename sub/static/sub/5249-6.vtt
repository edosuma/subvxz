00:01.501 --> 00:03.090
The Carmichael Show is recorded

00:03.091 --> 00:04.884
in front of a live studio audience.

00:05.129 --> 00:07.532
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

00:07.533 --> 00:09.500
Oh, my God!

00:09.501 --> 00:12.736
Maxine, are you out here
taking a pregnancy test?

00:15.173 --> 00:16.674
What is this?

00:16.675 --> 00:18.509
Oh, that-that's a sock drawer, Maxine.

00:18.510 --> 00:19.977
You're scared of socks now?

00:19.978 --> 00:22.647
'Cause that's an irrational
fear for a therapist.

00:22.648 --> 00:24.282
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

00:24.283 --> 00:26.384
What? What are you talking about?

00:26.385 --> 00:27.852
Oh!

00:27.853 --> 00:29.453
You talking about Petey?

00:29.454 --> 00:30.521
Yes!

00:30.522 --> 00:32.089
You brought a gun into our apartment?!

00:32.090 --> 00:34.358
No, no. I brought a gun into my apartment,

00:34.359 --> 00:36.426
and then you moved in, so...

00:37.862 --> 00:39.897
...technically, you moved in with us.

00:39.898 --> 00:41.960
How could you not tell me

00:41.961 --> 00:43.862
that there was a gun just lying around?

00:43.863 --> 00:45.363
First of all, it wasn't
"just lying around."

00:45.364 --> 00:46.665
It was in a sock drawer.

00:46.666 --> 00:48.433
And secondly, I didn't
know I had to tell you

00:48.434 --> 00:49.601
everything that was in the apartment.

00:49.602 --> 00:50.669
Full disclosure, Maxine,

00:50.670 --> 00:53.104
there's a yearbook in the closet.

00:53.105 --> 00:55.640
Look, Jerrod, I am anti-gun.

00:55.641 --> 00:57.242
Not just stricter gun laws,

00:57.243 --> 00:58.977
not "get rid of all the machine guns."

00:58.978 --> 01:01.179
I want absolutely no guns.

01:01.180 --> 01:03.582
So you're on the fence about guns.

01:03.583 --> 01:05.116
It's okay, Petey.

01:05.117 --> 01:07.686
I'm sorry the mean lady
scared you. Night, night.

01:07.687 --> 01:11.490
Look, I don't feel comfortable
with a gun in the apartment.

01:11.491 --> 01:13.458
You're not comfortable
with a gun in the apartment.

01:13.459 --> 01:15.861
I'm not comfortable without
a gun in the apartment.

01:15.862 --> 01:18.095
So I'll tell you what we'll do.

01:19.231 --> 01:21.031
I'm gonna keep the gun.

01:21.800 --> 01:23.502
What are you talking about?

01:23.503 --> 01:25.871
Well, we didn't agree, so I
made a leadership decision.

01:25.872 --> 01:27.606
You know, as the leader
of this relationship...

01:27.607 --> 01:28.640
Whoa, I'm sorry.

01:28.641 --> 01:31.209
"The leader of this relationship"?

01:31.210 --> 01:33.078
Yeah... Oh, you think
this is a sexist thing.

01:33.079 --> 01:34.880
No, no. I'm not the
leader because I'm a man.

01:34.881 --> 01:36.181
That's crazy.

01:36.182 --> 01:38.984
I just have, like, way more
leadership qualities than you.

01:38.985 --> 01:40.585
And I happen to be a man.

01:40.586 --> 01:42.654
But those two things are
totally separate, Maxine.

01:42.655 --> 01:45.156
Okay, there is no leader in a relationship.

01:45.157 --> 01:46.558
A relationship is a partnership.

01:46.559 --> 01:48.326
We are both leaders equally.

01:48.327 --> 01:49.861
You know, and the way to solve this

01:49.862 --> 01:51.429
is for us to talk about our perspectives.

01:51.430 --> 01:52.898
Talk about our feelings.

01:52.899 --> 01:55.066
Talk about our feel... That
doesn't sound like a leader.

01:55.067 --> 01:58.270
You think Oprah says that
to Stedman in the morning?

01:58.271 --> 02:01.907
Jerrod, where did that gun come from?

02:01.908 --> 02:04.009
My dad gave it to me when I was 18.

02:04.010 --> 02:06.478
He told me you can have
either a really nice gun

02:06.479 --> 02:10.181
or a really crappy car,
so I chose option A.

02:10.181 --> 02:11.583
That was the gun.

02:11.584 --> 02:13.451
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

02:13.452 --> 02:15.220
Mm-hmm, yeah.

02:15.221 --> 02:16.621
All right.

02:16.622 --> 02:18.023
What are you doing?

02:18.024 --> 02:19.558
Wait, what are you doing?

02:19.559 --> 02:21.526
Maxine, what are you do...? Maxine!

02:21.527 --> 02:22.827
Seriously, wha...? Where are you going?

02:22.828 --> 02:24.629
I am returning this gun
to where it came from.

02:24.630 --> 02:26.731
No, just stop for a second, Max...

02:26.732 --> 02:28.633
Stop, seriously.

02:28.634 --> 02:31.202
Maxine, as the leader of this relationship,

02:31.203 --> 02:33.705
I order you to stop!

02:33.706 --> 02:35.173
Give me a... give me a sec.

02:35.174 --> 02:36.474
She's gonna stop. Watch this.

02:36.475 --> 02:39.109
I said, Maxine, halt!

02:58.807 --> 03:01.863
Cynthia, what's that kick in
the mashed potatoes... paprika?

03:01.864 --> 03:03.731
Nekeisha, you've packed up

03:03.732 --> 03:07.168
an almost disrespectful amount of food.

03:07.169 --> 03:10.505
Well, ever since Bobby
moved out, nobody cooks.

03:10.506 --> 03:11.806
Bobby, you moved out?

03:11.807 --> 03:13.041
Where you living?

03:13.042 --> 03:14.976
- Nearby.
- Where?

03:14.977 --> 03:16.676
- Upstairs.
- Oh...

03:19.080 --> 03:21.049
Okay, Maxine, the game's
over; give it back.

03:21.050 --> 03:22.317
No. Stop.

03:22.318 --> 03:23.985
Hey, guys. Uh, is Joe here?

03:23.986 --> 03:26.554
Joe, the girl currently living with our son

03:26.555 --> 03:29.290
is looking for you out here!

03:29.291 --> 03:30.658
Oh, hey!

03:30.659 --> 03:32.327
Listen, that picture I texted you

03:32.328 --> 03:35.163
was meant for Cynthia.

03:35.164 --> 03:38.333
Uh, um, Joe, I'm-I'm
here to give you this.

03:38.334 --> 03:40.234
Oh, no! She's come for revenge!

03:40.235 --> 03:44.472
Hey, you got one shot,
and you better not miss.

03:44.473 --> 03:46.207
Oh, yeah.

03:46.208 --> 03:48.176
This is the gun I gave Jerrod.

03:48.177 --> 03:49.744
You gave my baby a gun?

03:49.745 --> 03:51.412
Wait, wait, wait, you
gave Jerrod a gun, too?

03:51.413 --> 03:54.482
I thought that was a
special moment between us.

03:54.483 --> 03:56.351
You gave both my babies a gun?!

03:56.352 --> 03:59.087
What, are you just
supplying arms to everybody?!

03:59.088 --> 04:02.623
You're like a one-man Iran-Contra.

04:02.624 --> 04:05.193
Yes, everybody should have guns.

04:05.194 --> 04:06.461
And you want to know why?

04:06.462 --> 04:08.529
Because when they come,
they gonna have guns.

04:08.530 --> 04:09.731
That's right, Maxine.

04:09.732 --> 04:12.100
We need guns because they have guns.

04:12.101 --> 04:13.434
What? Who are "they"?

04:13.435 --> 04:14.769
Yeah, yeah, who are "they"?

04:14.770 --> 04:16.870
Them.

04:19.107 --> 04:22.710
Oh... "them." Okay.

04:22.711 --> 04:23.911
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

04:23.912 --> 04:26.781
Are you talking about white
people or the government?

04:26.782 --> 04:28.783
Guns are never the answer.

04:28.784 --> 04:30.718
They only bring pain.

04:30.719 --> 04:33.821
I had a cousin that was shot by a neighbor

04:33.822 --> 04:36.257
over an argument, and
I have prayed every day

04:36.258 --> 04:37.892
that no one has to ever

04:37.893 --> 04:39.727
experience that kind of pain again.

04:39.728 --> 04:41.262
Well, I'm very sorry, Cynthia.

04:41.263 --> 04:42.397
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, that's not fair.

04:42.398 --> 04:44.298
Using your emotions to win an argument.

04:44.299 --> 04:47.034
What, are you running
for office or something?

04:47.035 --> 04:48.870
Look, listen, the fact
remains that it's better

04:48.871 --> 04:51.806
to have a gun and not need it
than to need it and not have it.

04:51.807 --> 04:53.241
Guns and Neosporin...

04:53.242 --> 04:55.710
you need both around
the house at all times.

04:55.711 --> 04:57.712
I mean, look what's happening around us.

04:57.713 --> 04:59.347
We are sitting ducks.

04:59.348 --> 05:02.650
At schools, in-in... movies.

05:02.651 --> 05:04.452
And them movies are expensive, too.

05:04.453 --> 05:06.788
I don't want to pay $12, only to be shot

05:06.789 --> 05:10.625
before I can see Matt Damon
get out of a sticky situation.

05:10.626 --> 05:14.395
I love seeing Matt Damon
get out of sticky situations.

05:14.396 --> 05:16.431
That's my favorite genre of movie.

05:16.432 --> 05:18.966
Hey, look, let me tell y'all something.

05:18.967 --> 05:20.401
Guns make me paranoid.

05:20.402 --> 05:21.803
You know, that's why I actually

05:21.804 --> 05:23.638
just dumped mine off in the park.

05:23.639 --> 05:26.641
God, I hope that's not true.

05:26.642 --> 05:28.509
I think guns are for punks.

05:28.510 --> 05:30.511
Give me a good old-fashioned
knife fight any day.

05:30.512 --> 05:31.979
See, if I'm gonna take you down,

05:31.980 --> 05:35.115
I want to look you straight in the eyes.

05:36.984 --> 05:38.853
You know something?

05:38.854 --> 05:41.689
I actually would hit somebody
with my car if I had to.

05:41.690 --> 05:42.790
Yep.

05:42.791 --> 05:43.825
What? This isn't an argument

05:43.826 --> 05:45.526
on the best way to kill somebody.

05:45.527 --> 05:46.627
- Oh.
- Oh.

05:46.628 --> 05:48.930
Well, then what are we talking about?

05:48.931 --> 05:51.766
Matt Damon. I thought we
was talking about Matt Damon.

05:51.767 --> 05:53.034
Look, Maxine, I don't know why

05:53.035 --> 05:54.602
you're all up in arms about this.

05:54.603 --> 05:57.104
I'm a safe, responsible gun owner.

05:57.105 --> 05:59.006
All right, that's still a problem.

05:59.007 --> 06:01.042
Even a responsible gun
owner can make mistakes.

06:01.043 --> 06:03.077
Did you know that you
are 12 times more likely

06:03.078 --> 06:05.847
to shoot somebody you know
than you are an intruder?

06:05.848 --> 06:07.215
12 times?

06:07.216 --> 06:10.318
Man, that's almost a baker's dozen.

06:10.319 --> 06:11.619
Look, that's mostly Crips and Bloods.

06:11.620 --> 06:13.387
They'll skew any poll if you let them.

06:13.388 --> 06:14.822
Look...

06:14.823 --> 06:16.791
Maxine, let me ask you, okay?

06:16.792 --> 06:18.392
Say an intruder breaks into our apartment,

06:18.393 --> 06:19.994
and we don't have a gun anymore.

06:19.995 --> 06:21.229
What are we supposed to do?

06:21.230 --> 06:22.497
- Call 911.
- No.

06:22.498 --> 06:23.631
But it's too late.

06:23.632 --> 06:25.233
He's already inside the apartment.

06:25.234 --> 06:28.503
Ooh, I'm nervous.

06:28.504 --> 06:30.371
If someone is breaking into our apartment,

06:30.372 --> 06:31.706
it would be to steal things.

06:31.707 --> 06:34.041
And I would never use
a gun to protect things.

06:34.042 --> 06:35.443
I would just use my words.

06:35.444 --> 06:37.245
I would tell them where
all our valuables are,

06:37.246 --> 06:38.813
and then we would be safe.

06:43.551 --> 06:46.553
I'm sorry, I thought that was a joke.

06:47.989 --> 06:50.625
Well, a real man does not need a gun

06:50.626 --> 06:52.260
to protect himself.

06:52.261 --> 06:55.096
What are you talking about?
I'm as real as they come.

06:55.097 --> 06:56.597
And I own a gun.

06:56.598 --> 06:58.266
Joe, you do not have a gun.

06:58.267 --> 07:01.335
I made you get rid of that
gun when Bobby was born.

07:01.336 --> 07:04.005
And for your own
protection, I didn't listen.

07:04.006 --> 07:06.774
There is no gun around here!

07:06.775 --> 07:09.609
I know this house inside and out!

07:18.352 --> 07:19.687
Joe!

07:19.688 --> 07:23.257
You got a gun just sitting behind Jesus?

07:23.258 --> 07:24.725
Mm-hmm.

07:24.726 --> 07:27.461
You give that gun to me.
I'm gonna get rid of it!

07:27.462 --> 07:28.563
Hold on.

07:28.564 --> 07:30.431
You threaten my gun, you threaten me, now.

07:30.432 --> 07:32.967
Wow, look how aggressive
guns are making you.

07:32.968 --> 07:35.903
Guns don't make people aggressive, Maxine.

07:35.904 --> 07:38.706
Guns shoot people.

07:38.707 --> 07:40.708
Yeah, and it's not aggression,
Maxine, it's passion.

07:40.709 --> 07:43.210
Passion for defending yourself,
for defending your family.

07:43.211 --> 07:45.680
I mean, look, the truth is, without a gun,

07:45.681 --> 07:47.348
you're merely asking for respect;

07:47.349 --> 07:49.116
with one, you're demanding it.

07:49.117 --> 07:50.518
See, that's poetry right there, boy.

07:50.519 --> 07:51.586
Thank you.

07:51.587 --> 07:53.621
It's like Maya Angelou's spirit

07:53.622 --> 07:54.956
has inhabited your body.

07:54.957 --> 07:56.924
Thank you.

07:56.925 --> 07:58.626
You two have lost your minds.

07:58.627 --> 08:00.161
You know what, Jerrod? Keep your gun.

08:00.162 --> 08:01.462
But as long as it's there,

08:01.463 --> 08:02.964
I will not be coming home with you.

08:02.965 --> 08:04.495
Oh, now you're not coming home?

08:04.496 --> 08:05.433
So where you gonna go, Maxine?

08:05.434 --> 08:07.401
I... will figure it out.

08:07.402 --> 08:10.438
Hey, look, we got plenty
of room here, you know.

08:10.439 --> 08:14.075
I've been staying here a whole
week and nobody even noticed.

08:14.076 --> 08:16.711
Maxine, yes, you can
come here and stay with us

08:16.712 --> 08:18.746
in a gun-free environment.

08:18.747 --> 08:21.582
Because, Joe, that gun is not staying here.

08:21.583 --> 08:23.184
Well, that's fine with me.

08:23.185 --> 08:24.685
I'll go somewhere where my rights

08:24.686 --> 08:26.120
will not be trampled upon.

08:26.121 --> 08:28.556
Me and my gun are going to stay with Jerrod

08:28.557 --> 08:30.524
until you realize this is America.

08:30.525 --> 08:31.692
That's right, Dad.

08:31.693 --> 08:34.861
Now, this-this isn't
gonna last long, right?

08:34.863 --> 08:36.998
And while we're at it, quit adding paprika

08:36.999 --> 08:38.232
to the mashed potatoes.

08:38.232 --> 08:39.332
Oh, no, you didn't!

08:39.333 --> 08:40.934
Come on, Jerrod. Yell something hurtful.

08:40.936 --> 08:42.102
Let's get up out of here.

08:42.104 --> 08:44.138
All right, well, Maxine...

08:44.139 --> 08:46.474
stop humming in the shower.

08:46.475 --> 08:48.708
Either sing or shut up.

08:54.181 --> 08:56.751
She may think she kicked
me out, but I walked out.

08:56.752 --> 08:58.753
- You saw me walk out, right?
- Yeah, I saw you walk out.

08:58.754 --> 09:00.287
You walked out with me, didn't you?

09:00.288 --> 09:01.956
Mm-hmm, you should've seen
us walk out of there, too,

09:01.957 --> 09:04.625
with our guns, looking like two
dudes from a Tarantino movie.

09:04.626 --> 09:05.960
Yeah, man.

09:05.961 --> 09:07.228
You know what?

09:07.229 --> 09:09.063
These women don't know
how much they need us.

09:09.064 --> 09:10.731
Just the other day, Maxine
said to me, she said,

09:10.732 --> 09:12.400
"Hey, Jerrod, what do you
think about this outfit?"

09:12.401 --> 09:13.934
You know what I said? I said,

09:13.935 --> 09:16.070
"I'm gonna be honest, Maxine,
I think rompers look stupid."

09:16.071 --> 09:17.405
See, that's beautiful, son.

09:17.406 --> 09:19.807
That takes a lot of
courage to be that honest.

09:19.808 --> 09:21.142
You must really care for her.

09:21.143 --> 09:22.309
I know! Now, listen.

09:22.310 --> 09:23.544
A lesser man would've sent her

09:23.545 --> 09:25.112
out into the world looking like a toddler.

09:25.113 --> 09:26.947
But no, not me.

09:26.948 --> 09:28.716
No, not Big J.

09:28.717 --> 09:30.251
I care too much, you know?

09:30.252 --> 09:31.519
That's my only flaw.

09:31.520 --> 09:33.154
Right, now, that's a beautiful thing, son.

09:33.155 --> 09:34.288
That's a beautiful thing.

09:34.289 --> 09:35.423
All right, well, Dad,

09:35.424 --> 09:37.124
gonna get some sleep, all right?

09:37.125 --> 09:39.627
All right, yeah, I think
I'm gonna turn in myself.

09:39.628 --> 09:40.761
All right.

09:40.762 --> 09:41.829
Well, help yourself to anything.

09:41.830 --> 09:43.030
We got food in the fridge.

09:43.031 --> 09:44.098
Remote's right there on the table.

09:44.099 --> 09:45.365
And here you go.

09:48.369 --> 09:49.603
What's that for?

09:49.604 --> 09:51.572
Oh, it's for you in case it gets cold.

09:51.573 --> 09:52.973
It gets drafty here at night.

09:52.974 --> 09:54.842
Well, shouldn't you keep
this blanket for yourself?

09:54.843 --> 09:56.510
'Cause I'm gonna be taking the bed.

09:56.511 --> 09:57.812
No, no. It's my place.

09:57.813 --> 09:59.513
I'm not giving up my bed.

09:59.514 --> 10:02.216
No, I am your father,
so I'm taking the bed.

10:02.217 --> 10:04.185
Okay, look, Dad,

10:04.186 --> 10:06.554
all right, I realize that
you really want the bed,

10:06.555 --> 10:08.589
but I'm sorry, you just
can't have it, okay?

10:08.590 --> 10:10.224
- All right, good night.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

10:10.225 --> 10:12.426
Did you just pull your gun out on me?

10:12.427 --> 10:13.561
What?

10:13.562 --> 10:15.396
No, I was just taking
it out of my back pocket.

10:15.397 --> 10:17.598
No, you pulled your gun
out to intimidate me.

10:17.599 --> 10:19.600
When did you get so power-hungry, son?

10:19.601 --> 10:21.635
Just waving your gun
all inches from my face.

10:21.636 --> 10:22.870
Okay, Dad,

10:22.871 --> 10:24.572
you are blowing this way out of proportion.

10:24.573 --> 10:26.006
Out of proportion?!

10:26.007 --> 10:28.809
You just held me up at gunpoint.

10:28.810 --> 10:30.411
And for what, a bed?

10:30.412 --> 10:32.880
No, no, Dad, that's not
at all what just happened.

10:32.881 --> 10:36.050
You pulled your gun out
to put your foot down.

10:36.051 --> 10:38.085
No, Dad, look, did I have a gun? Yes.

10:38.086 --> 10:39.487
Was I putting my foot down? Yes.

10:39.488 --> 10:41.489
But I wasn't using a
gun to put my foot down.

10:41.490 --> 10:43.124
Oh, you think you're
the only one that's gonna

10:43.125 --> 10:45.559
put your foot down? I
can put my foot down, too.

10:45.560 --> 10:48.328
Now! What you gonna do, Jerrod?!

10:51.499 --> 10:53.033
What? What is...

10:53.034 --> 10:54.301
What's wrong with us?

10:54.302 --> 10:56.303
Oh, oh, we got crazy. We
got crazy. We got crazy.

10:56.304 --> 10:57.772
- It was me though.
- We got crazy.

10:57.773 --> 10:59.173
Oh, my God, it's the guns.

10:59.174 --> 11:00.775
It makes me feel so empowered.

11:00.776 --> 11:02.209
It's like listening to
Beyoncé's album, right?

11:02.210 --> 11:04.111
You just feel stronger and
prettier for some reason.

11:04.112 --> 11:05.579
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

11:05.580 --> 11:07.815
You know what I like to do
when your mama's not around?

11:07.816 --> 11:10.184
I like to take my gun out and
do a little dance in the mirror.

11:10.185 --> 11:11.752
Do you?

11:11.753 --> 11:12.920
I like your gun dance.

11:12.921 --> 11:14.255
That's a nice dance.

11:14.256 --> 11:16.090
Well, look, let me put this thing away

11:16.091 --> 11:17.358
before we hurt somebody.

11:17.359 --> 11:18.826
Oh!

11:18.827 --> 11:20.060
Oh, my God!

11:20.061 --> 11:21.462
Dad, I just shot you!

11:21.463 --> 11:23.196
I would've taken the couch!

11:35.769 --> 11:37.574
I don't know how they do it in your house,

11:37.575 --> 11:40.410
but in this house, if a
person has something to say,

11:40.411 --> 11:42.045
they just come on in and say it.

11:42.046 --> 11:43.947
I don't... I don't have anything to say.

11:43.948 --> 11:47.450
I was just... checking in
to see what you're doing.

11:47.451 --> 11:48.885
Everything's fine, so.

11:48.886 --> 11:50.787
So, uh, what are you doing?

11:50.788 --> 11:53.857
I'm trying to find The Mindy Project.

11:53.858 --> 11:56.759
Which channel is Hulu?

11:57.761 --> 11:59.663
I should be feeling really
good about this, right?

11:59.664 --> 12:01.898
'Cause you and I took a real stand tonight.

12:01.899 --> 12:03.233
We're fighting our men.

12:03.234 --> 12:04.968
We're like Thelma and Louise.

12:04.969 --> 12:06.570
Except without the guns.

12:06.571 --> 12:09.539
- Am I Brad Pitt?
- Oh!

12:09.540 --> 12:10.907
Bobby, you scared me.

12:10.908 --> 12:12.909
I forgot you're living here now.

12:12.910 --> 12:14.211
Yeah, that's right, Mama,

12:14.212 --> 12:16.112
and I'm not going nowhere anytime soon.

12:16.113 --> 12:17.814
I mean, every bed in this house

12:17.815 --> 12:20.049
is more comfortable than the last.

12:21.685 --> 12:23.453
Now, hold on.

12:23.454 --> 12:25.555
I don't need y'all snuggling in here.

12:25.556 --> 12:27.891
I plan to enjoy myself tonight.

12:27.892 --> 12:30.327
This is the only good
part of having a fight.

12:30.328 --> 12:32.896
I get to eat as many chips as I want,

12:32.897 --> 12:34.397
watch as much TV as I want

12:34.398 --> 12:37.567
before Joe come crawling
back in the morning.

12:37.568 --> 12:40.237
So how do you know that he's
gonna come crawling back?

12:40.238 --> 12:41.538
30 years of marriage.

12:41.539 --> 12:45.242
Plus, besides, who else wants him, Maxine?

12:46.644 --> 12:49.846
So... so you think Jerrod
will come crawling back, too?

12:49.847 --> 12:52.282
Hell no!

12:52.283 --> 12:54.117
Number one, you two aren't married.

12:54.118 --> 12:56.419
And also Jerrod has plenty
of women to pick from.

12:56.420 --> 12:59.256
Yeah. That girl Lisa at the donut shop,

12:59.257 --> 13:00.824
she asks about him every day.

13:00.825 --> 13:02.392
You know Lisa with the cloudy eye.

13:02.393 --> 13:05.328
Yeah, Lisa with the cloudy eye.

13:06.831 --> 13:08.899
So, okay, how is this gonna end?

13:08.900 --> 13:10.500
Am I just gonna have to give in?

13:10.501 --> 13:11.768
Am I gonna have to be the pushover?

13:11.769 --> 13:13.103
'Cause I don't want to be a pushover.

13:13.104 --> 13:14.537
Then don't be one.

13:14.538 --> 13:17.774
See, this is more than about guns.

13:17.775 --> 13:20.477
This is about how you're
gonna fight as a couple.

13:20.478 --> 13:23.647
Now, if you give in, the
next time you make a stand,

13:23.648 --> 13:26.116
it is not gonna hold as much weight.

13:26.117 --> 13:27.884
Besides,

13:27.885 --> 13:31.655
it's real easy not to take you seriously.

13:31.656 --> 13:35.324
'Cause there's something about your face.

13:40.063 --> 13:44.000
So you're saying don't give
in to Jerrod no matter what?

13:44.001 --> 13:47.237
I'm saying that relationships are tested.

13:47.238 --> 13:48.905
And it's for good reason.

13:48.906 --> 13:51.207
You have to find out how strong you are.

13:51.208 --> 13:53.410
And the sooner you know, the better.

13:55.246 --> 13:56.913
What was that?

13:56.914 --> 13:58.581
Maybe it was Joe.

13:58.582 --> 13:59.950
No, his car's not out there.

13:59.951 --> 14:01.017
Neither is Jerrod's.

14:01.018 --> 14:02.652
I think we getting robbed.

14:02.653 --> 14:03.954
Oh, no!

14:03.955 --> 14:05.854
Maxine, go on down there and check!

14:19.336 --> 14:21.338
Damn it, I can't find the Neosporin.

14:21.339 --> 14:23.039
All I got is Tylenol and Advil.

14:23.040 --> 14:24.541
Okay, well, just read the bottle.

14:24.542 --> 14:27.510
Tell me which one's good for gunshots.

14:27.511 --> 14:29.212
I can't believe I shot you.

14:29.213 --> 14:30.613
Like, I'm a dad shooter.

14:30.614 --> 14:32.816
All right, deal with your
guilt on your own time.

14:32.817 --> 14:34.617
Now, we got to get our story straight.

14:34.618 --> 14:37.787
Um, we got to tell your
mama that I stubbed my toe.

14:37.788 --> 14:40.590
You stubbed your toe on what, a bullet?

14:40.591 --> 14:43.159
Look, Jerrod she cannot
find out about this,

14:43.160 --> 14:44.961
or she's gonna do something irrational,

14:44.962 --> 14:47.964
like blame this all on the
guns and say I was wrong.

14:47.965 --> 14:49.766
How are you gonna hide this from her?

14:49.767 --> 14:51.968
Oh, I hid much bigger stuff
than this from your mama.

14:51.969 --> 14:53.403
Really?

14:53.404 --> 14:56.172
What's bigger than your son
shooting you in the foot?

14:56.173 --> 14:58.975
Gambling.

14:58.976 --> 15:02.945
Uh, the Cherokee Indians
own most of our house now.

15:04.314 --> 15:06.449
Okay, so we gonna say that we went bowling,

15:06.450 --> 15:08.785
and y-you dropped a
bowling ball on my foot.

15:08.786 --> 15:10.453
It's my fault even in the fake story?

15:10.454 --> 15:12.989
Yes, it's your fault
even in the fake story.

15:12.990 --> 15:14.190
This is all your fault.

15:14.191 --> 15:15.425
You shot me!

15:15.426 --> 15:17.293
I know, I know. I shot you.

15:17.294 --> 15:19.295
God, this whole thing has been a nightmare.

15:19.296 --> 15:20.730
Maxine was right. Come on, let's go.

15:20.731 --> 15:22.399
I'm gonna get her, and
I'm taking you back home.

15:22.400 --> 15:26.269
First you shoot me, then
you gonna kick me out?

15:26.270 --> 15:29.705
You are one cold bastard, son.

15:30.907 --> 15:33.343
Can I at least get a pair of
shoes with no hole in them?

15:33.344 --> 15:35.245
Yeah, fine. Uh, here.

15:35.246 --> 15:36.780
Take these, put these on.

15:36.781 --> 15:39.214
- Let's go.
- But these don't even match my outfit.

15:40.984 --> 15:42.452
You're fine. You look fine.

15:42.453 --> 15:43.920
All right, quick, let's go over the story.

15:43.921 --> 15:44.921
Wh-What'd you bowl?

15:44.922 --> 15:46.156
Who cares?

15:46.157 --> 15:48.058
The details make the lie!

15:48.059 --> 15:50.093
Okay, I bowled a 219.

15:50.094 --> 15:52.327
You bowled a 68.

15:54.564 --> 15:56.099
Oh!

15:56.100 --> 15:59.102
All right, everybody, let's
go. Let's get out of here!

15:59.103 --> 16:01.805
Oh! Joe! Oh.

16:01.806 --> 16:03.673
- What's going on down here?
- Somebody in the kitchen.

16:03.674 --> 16:05.075
We got to get out of here.

16:05.076 --> 16:06.743
Somebody's in the kitchen?

16:06.744 --> 16:08.745
- All right, I'm going in.
- Dad...

16:08.746 --> 16:11.047
Joe, something wrong with your leg?

16:11.048 --> 16:14.050
Those shoes are dope, Daddy.

16:14.051 --> 16:15.118
Everybody shut up!

16:15.119 --> 16:16.686
I'm-I'm about to go shoot somebody.

16:16.687 --> 16:18.021
No. Wait. Come on, stop.

16:18.022 --> 16:19.856
That is a human being that is in there.

16:19.857 --> 16:21.491
They're probably just a
victim of circumstance.

16:21.492 --> 16:24.027
Nobody told them their value.
No one taught them their worth.

16:24.028 --> 16:26.062
You know what, Dad, Maxine's right.

16:26.063 --> 16:28.414
You changed your mind? Because
of what I just said right now?

16:28.415 --> 16:29.723
- That was pretty good, right?
- No. No, no.

16:29.724 --> 16:31.291
I just don't want my dad to
shoot somebody, all right?

16:31.292 --> 16:32.602
That's a very reasonable stance to take.

16:32.603 --> 16:34.437
Stop making this about you.

16:34.438 --> 16:35.772
Dad, don't-don't shoot anybody.

16:35.773 --> 16:37.540
Just go outside and let's call the police.

16:37.541 --> 16:39.142
I don't have time to call the police.

16:39.143 --> 16:41.010
I need to protect my home now.

16:42.313 --> 16:43.680
What the hell?

16:43.681 --> 16:44.948
- Oh, my God.
- Keisha.

16:44.949 --> 16:46.349
Nekeisha, come on.

16:46.350 --> 16:48.017
- You tried to shoot me?
- Huh?

16:48.018 --> 16:50.854
Well, I didn't take
all the leftovers. Damn!

16:50.855 --> 16:54.257
Joe, look what you did.
You almost shot Nekeisha.

16:54.258 --> 16:56.259
I was aiming above her head.

16:56.260 --> 16:57.660
It was a warning shot.

16:57.661 --> 17:00.096
I don't know why this
damn thing didn't fire.

17:00.097 --> 17:01.564
Oh, my bad. That's on me.

17:01.565 --> 17:04.965
I emptied all your bullets out
after I shot you in the foot.

17:06.069 --> 17:10.073
You shot your daddy in the foot?!

17:10.074 --> 17:11.840
Now, why would you do that?

17:11.842 --> 17:13.276
It was an accident.

17:13.277 --> 17:14.644
I told you that would happen.

17:14.645 --> 17:17.247
I can't believe you tried to shoot me.

17:17.248 --> 17:18.915
Okay, Keisha, we've
already talked about it.

17:18.915 --> 17:20.782
Keep up with the conversation.

17:20.784 --> 17:22.752
All right,

17:22.752 --> 17:24.420
this whole thing has been a disaster, Dad.

17:24.421 --> 17:27.156
I mean, I shot you,
you almost shot someone.

17:27.157 --> 17:30.859
Nekeisha. He almost shot Nekeisha.

17:32.061 --> 17:34.430
I really think it's time
you get rid of your gun.

17:34.431 --> 17:36.432
Look, Dad, look, you can give
the gun at the police station,

17:36.433 --> 17:37.700
and they'll give you some free pizza.

17:37.701 --> 17:39.068
No, no.

17:39.069 --> 17:41.337
He is not getting rid of that gun.

17:41.338 --> 17:44.007
When I heard that noise
down here, I felt helpless.

17:44.008 --> 17:47.010
So I want a gun in this
house. I want lots of guns.

17:47.011 --> 17:50.746
I want a gun behind every
one of these paintings!

17:54.117 --> 17:58.087
So... nobody's gonna talk
about how Joe tried to kill me?

17:58.088 --> 18:00.823
When you gonna let that go?

18:00.824 --> 18:02.592
Nekeisha, you are

18:02.593 --> 18:04.060
always welcome in this house,

18:04.061 --> 18:06.129
but if you come over
here again unannounced,

18:06.130 --> 18:08.363
you might catch a stray.

18:09.832 --> 18:11.721
- Come on, honey. Let's go to bed.
- All right.

18:11.722 --> 18:14.723
Now, Jerrod, you can give
your gun back if you want to,

18:14.724 --> 18:17.293
but it's only gonna make you seem weak.

18:17.294 --> 18:19.228
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Lord.

18:19.229 --> 18:20.596
Oh, you okay, Big Daddy?

18:20.597 --> 18:22.163
I'm all right.

18:23.932 --> 18:27.469
So, you, uh, came to
tell me that I was right?

18:27.470 --> 18:30.306
Yeah. I mean, pretty big of me, right?

18:30.307 --> 18:31.907
- Oh!
- Oh!

18:31.908 --> 18:35.110
Damn, damn!

18:35.111 --> 18:37.413
Look, Maxine,

18:37.414 --> 18:39.748
I'm gonna give up my gun, okay?

18:39.749 --> 18:41.417
- Thank you, Jerrod.
- All right.

18:41.418 --> 18:42.751
Mwah.

18:42.752 --> 18:45.754
Looks like I'm the leader
of this relationship.

18:45.755 --> 18:47.289
No, there... Maxine,

18:47.290 --> 18:49.958
there are no leaders in
a relationship, you see?

18:49.959 --> 18:51.760
I mean, relationships

18:51.761 --> 18:54.096
are a partnership; we're
both leaders equally.

18:54.097 --> 18:56.699
You know, I am... I am
glad that you came around.

18:56.700 --> 18:59.068
But I got to admit, there
was a tiny part of me

18:59.069 --> 19:01.303
that hoped that there was
an intruder who would come in

19:01.304 --> 19:03.739
and shoot us to death, so
that you could find our bodies

19:03.740 --> 19:05.341
and see that I was right about guns

19:05.342 --> 19:08.477
and feel guilty about it
for the rest of your life.

19:08.478 --> 19:11.712
Damn, girls are messed up.

19:16.912 --> 19:18.307
Oh!

19:18.308 --> 19:19.909
Oh, this makes me feel like

19:19.910 --> 19:23.412
I can solve all the problems of the world.

19:23.413 --> 19:26.382
Maxine, change your major.

19:26.383 --> 19:29.451
Bobby, move back in with Nekeisha.

19:29.452 --> 19:31.220
- Mm-mm.
- All right, now, Cynthia,

19:31.221 --> 19:34.089
- baby, now, to load a gun, you
press this on the side, - Okay.

19:34.090 --> 19:36.425
This lever and the... Wait a minute.

19:36.426 --> 19:38.227
Jerrod, there's a bullet in here.

19:38.228 --> 19:39.962
I thought you took all the bullets out.

19:39.963 --> 19:42.298
Oh, God, that's my bad.
I must have forgot one.

19:42.299 --> 19:43.832
So, wait, you could've shot me?

19:43.833 --> 19:47.636
You're still talking about
that? I thought you was a badass.

19:47.637 --> 19:48.871
Yeah, why you still holding on to that?

19:48.872 --> 19:50.205
I already said I'm sorry.

19:50.206 --> 19:52.207
No, you didn't. You never apologized.

19:52.208 --> 19:54.643
I mean, my life was genuinely
threatened yesterday.

19:54.644 --> 19:56.812
Well, we think you are overreacting.

19:56.813 --> 19:58.614
- Yes.
- Yeah, yeah. A little bit.

19:58.615 --> 20:00.883
- Hey, I think it's time for us to go.
- Yeah.

20:00.884 --> 20:02.651
I'm leaving Petey with you.

20:02.652 --> 20:05.220
But, uh, before I go,

20:05.221 --> 20:06.956
let me say good-bye, all right?

20:06.957 --> 20:09.458
Petey, I'm gonna miss you.
