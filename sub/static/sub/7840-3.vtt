00:32.738 --> 00:33.533
This place is looking

00:33.534 --> 00:34.889
a little run down.

00:34.978 --> 00:35.950
Yeah, hasn't

00:35.979 --> 00:36.333
been the same

00:36.362 --> 00:37.276
since they murdered

00:37.305 --> 00:38.955
the Mayor's dad here.

00:44.419 --> 00:46.512
Ooh, a J.C. Penney's....

00:46.686 --> 00:48.197
used to be here.

00:49.532 --> 00:50.621
Now it's a collection

00:50.625 --> 00:51.673
of candle kiosks

00:51.672 --> 00:53.491
and Persian CD stores.

00:53.612 --> 00:54.464
How you doing, bro?

00:54.589 --> 00:55.760
We've got the latest by Nabil,

00:55.905 --> 00:56.910
Uma Shang Shang,

00:57.005 --> 00:58.123
The Flower Song!

00:58.535 --> 00:59.733
 Uma shang shang 

01:00.035 --> 01:01.253
 Uma shang shang 

01:01.507 --> 01:02.702
uma shang shang 

01:02.915 --> 01:04.360
Is like Bruce Springsteen

01:04.367 --> 01:05.140
the Boss, ya?

01:05.315 --> 01:05.881
I guess.

01:06.167 --> 01:06.950
If you buy now,

01:07.058 --> 01:08.770
I give you, uh, toothache cream.

01:08.998 --> 01:09.833
Toothache cream.

01:09.975 --> 01:10.292
Deal!

01:10.546 --> 01:11.381
We have deal.

01:15.306 --> 01:16.382
Where's the beef?

01:16.656 --> 01:17.520
You ain't so bad.

01:17.666 --> 01:18.851
Where's the beef?

01:19.025 --> 01:19.893
You ain't so bad.

01:20.095 --> 01:21.210
Where's the beef?

01:21.428 --> 01:22.330
You ain't so bad.

01:22.657 --> 01:24.680
These games are so old.

01:24.697 --> 01:26.083
Who got these high scores?

01:26.095 --> 01:26.751
Pilgrims?

01:27.448 --> 01:29.560
Hmm, never saw this one before.

01:36.385 --> 01:37.322
What's going on here?

01:37.598 --> 01:39.082
Am I destroying these triangles

01:39.086 --> 01:40.183
or trying to assemble them?

01:41.105 --> 01:41.900
What does this button do?

01:42.598 --> 01:43.890
Now my ship is pooping

01:43.898 --> 01:44.840
more triangles.

01:46.546 --> 01:48.972
Oh, no, I won a free game.

01:52.088 --> 01:53.753
Ooh, gummy worms!

01:53.916 --> 01:55.060
That candy's been here

01:55.085 --> 01:56.050
an awfully long time.

01:56.056 --> 01:57.822
I'd think twice if I were you.

01:58.096 --> 01:59.000
Don't tell me

01:59.005 --> 02:00.350
how many times to think!

02:02.826 --> 02:04.503
Mmm...

02:08.025 --> 02:08.841
You are not bringing

02:08.848 --> 02:09.741
that thing home.

02:09.866 --> 02:10.951
Then stand back.

02:18.736 --> 02:19.641
This doesn't taste

02:19.696 --> 02:20.883
like I thought it would.

02:27.278 --> 02:28.761
Well, if you're through,

02:28.877 --> 02:29.660
let's check out that

02:29.735 --> 02:31.381
discount book warehouse.

02:31.415 --> 02:33.121
We already own a book.

02:35.855 --> 02:38.002
Wisconsin From Above.

02:38.238 --> 02:39.843
Veterans' Day Parades.

02:40.607 --> 02:43.192
Ooh, Smiles of Ireland!

02:44.147 --> 02:45.612
Redheaded twins?

02:46.296 --> 02:47.041
Their mother must have

02:47.047 --> 02:47.042
Their mother must have

02:47.048 --> 02:48.140
her hands full.

02:49.668 --> 02:50.242
Hmm.

02:51.586 --> 02:53.860
Cool, a carpenter's library.

02:55.167 --> 02:56.230
This doesn't look easy,

02:56.735 --> 02:57.580
but I'll bet it is.

02:57.785 --> 02:59.710
Well, I like the idea

02:59.738 --> 03:01.123
of you as a handyman.

03:01.208 --> 03:02.771
And I love the idea

03:02.788 --> 03:03.772
of you reading.

03:03.948 --> 03:04.921
Oh, yeah?

03:05.956 --> 03:07.581
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

03:07.678 --> 03:09.270
Blah, blah, blah,

03:09.886 --> 03:10.462
Ooh

03:10.527 --> 03:11.030
Oh!

03:11.058 --> 03:11.961
Blah, blah, blah,

03:12.336 --> 03:13.381
Blah, blah, blah,

03:13.435 --> 03:14.800
blah, blah, blah...

03:14.975 --> 03:15.983
Okay, now you do me.

03:17.255 --> 03:18.742
I never want to go back to that mall.

03:18.797 --> 03:20.540
There were eelsin the photo booth.

03:21.685 --> 03:23.250
Eww!

03:24.938 --> 03:26.743
Bart, here's a letter from your school.

03:27.056 --> 03:29.390
A fire? I didn't start a fire in the teachers' lounge.

03:29.488 --> 03:30.763
I  mean, what fire?

03:30.805 --> 03:33.850
I mean, a letter from school?Please elaborate.

03:34.146 --> 03:35.513
Someone at your school

03:35.547 --> 03:37.961
has a life-threatening peanut allergy.

03:38.125 --> 03:39.410
Cool! Who is it?

03:39.576 --> 03:41.013
The letter doesn't say.

03:41.137 --> 03:42.963
But from now on,no peanut products

03:42.975 --> 03:44.752
are allowed on school property.

03:44.968 --> 03:46.100
Hmm, let's see what you've got.

03:46.695 --> 03:48.193
Peanut butter and jelly sandwich,

03:48.498 --> 03:50.370
trail mix, starring peanuts.

03:50.676 --> 03:52.900
Good grief, more peanuts!

04:00.116 --> 04:01.590
Harley Mozell is hit from behind

04:01.626 --> 04:02.982
by J.T. Delacroix!

04:03.105 --> 04:04.891
And Earl Tilleson!

04:04.926 --> 04:06.612
Oh, and Buddy Rollette!

04:06.768 --> 04:07.982
And the Pecker Brothers,

04:08.067 --> 04:08.990
Danny and Dell!

04:09.407 --> 04:10.902
And the ol' Grizzly himself--

04:11.145 --> 04:12.732
Weasel Johnson Junior!

04:12.736 --> 04:14.053
Look at that carnage.

04:14.195 --> 04:15.020
We are worse

04:15.056 --> 04:16.151
than the ancient Romans!

04:17.016 --> 04:18.952
Homie, don't you want to build something

04:18.958 --> 04:20.523
with your new fix-it books?

04:20.777 --> 04:22.012
I did. I made a foot rest.

04:23.507 --> 04:25.892
Oh, don't you have any follow-through on anything?

04:25.967 --> 04:28.200
What's the point?We're all slowly dying.

04:32.678 --> 04:34.343
Oh, the floorboard

04:34.355 --> 04:35.912
broke my nightstand.

04:39.336 --> 04:40.640
Hmm...

04:41.846 --> 04:43.042
Hmm...

04:46.785 --> 04:47.512
I  did it!

04:48.185 --> 04:50.420
What's that strange feeling?

04:51.277 --> 04:53.091
It's "of accomplishment"!

05:05.846 --> 05:07.800
Wow, Mom, you made all this?

05:08.077 --> 05:09.830
It's like you're the Jesus of carpentry.

05:09.945 --> 05:12.800
Aww, what a sweet blasphemy.

05:12.886 --> 05:14.540
This is a valuable skill.

05:14.618 --> 05:17.123
People might even pay you to build things for them.

05:17.225 --> 05:19.631
I could start my own carpentry business.

05:19.808 --> 05:21.521
I'm already arranging the clip art

05:21.605 --> 05:23.212
for the letterhead in my mind.

05:27.806 --> 05:28.351
Perfect!

05:31.085 --> 05:32.082
Can I help you, Miss?

05:32.247 --> 05:33.911
I'm here to fix your bookcase.

05:34.067 --> 05:35.420
You answered my flyer.

05:35.785 --> 05:36.711
Hmm, yeah.

05:37.025 --> 05:38.191
And you're the carpenter?

05:38.258 --> 05:38.902
That's right.

05:39.056 --> 05:42.071
I see. Not that I have anything against female carpenters,

05:42.168 --> 05:43.973
but I have some pictures hanging

05:43.985 --> 05:46.570
that you might find,um... unsavory.

05:46.586 --> 05:47.031
Good-bye.

05:48.955 --> 05:50.451
A lady carpenter?

05:50.472 --> 05:51.601
I don't know.

05:51.722 --> 05:52.704
What if you get pregnant

05:52.749 --> 05:54.350
and I'm left with half a hot tub?

05:54.568 --> 05:56.573
And don't tell me you're infertile.

05:56.726 --> 05:58.433
I ain't falling for that again.

06:01.295 --> 06:03.180
It's so unfair.

06:03.307 --> 06:05.401
I'm as handy as any man.

06:05.466 --> 06:06.860
You sure are, sweetie.

06:07.025 --> 06:08.370
I love this bed you made.

06:10.177 --> 06:12.551
I guess people just expect their carpenter

06:12.557 --> 06:15.742
to be some fat guy with his butt crack showing.

06:22.948 --> 06:25.192
Homer, your butt just gave me

06:25.295 --> 06:26.770
a brilliant idea!

06:27.115 --> 06:28.013
Yep, it'll do that.

06:30.956 --> 06:33.251
"Simpsons Manly-Man Handyman"at your service.

06:33.408 --> 06:34.822
Ah, superlative!

06:34.906 --> 06:36.732
Please install a doggie door

06:36.857 --> 06:38.923
sized for a teacup poodle.

06:39.115 --> 06:40.920
No problem.

06:41.066 --> 06:44.160
Why don't you go inside and stir your flubber

06:44.457 --> 06:45.612
while I get to work?

06:47.376 --> 06:49.471
Marge, the coast is clear.

06:55.677 --> 06:57.170
I'm terribly sorry.I thought I heard

06:57.177 --> 06:58.571
the sound of a woman measuring.

06:58.737 --> 07:00.503
Oh, uh, that was me.

07:00.587 --> 07:01.903
You know that old saying:

07:02.148 --> 07:04.533
"Measure like a girl,hammer like a guy."

07:04.697 --> 07:07.122
Yes, but you're holding your hammer backwards.

07:07.357 --> 07:08.911
Oh, uh... you know what they say,

07:09.046 --> 07:10.680
"Hammer with the wood and it's all good."

07:10.856 --> 07:12.800
It's all good.

07:13.536 --> 07:14.591
All right, then.

07:23.255 --> 07:24.212
A  dash of glue,

07:24.257 --> 07:26.722
a turn of screw,

07:26.816 --> 07:30.730
and a gazebo's built that's perfect for two... or more.

07:31.786 --> 07:33.000
Uh-oh, switch!

07:34.475 --> 07:36.093
Eh... eh... eh!

07:36.255 --> 07:37.571
And... done!

07:37.728 --> 07:38.852
Mm-mmm!

07:38.896 --> 07:40.701
Simpson, you're a master craftsman.

07:40.776 --> 07:42.733
Listen,what would you say

07:42.788 --> 07:45.182
if I told you a woman did most of the work?

07:45.536 --> 07:48.210
I'd have this gazebo torn downand built into a coffin...

07:48.476 --> 07:49.330
for your manhood.(shrieks)

07:50.377 --> 07:53.041
Why did my hypothetical scenario scare you so?

07:53.235 --> 07:57.710
Uh, like all manly men,I have a vivid imagination.

07:58.098 --> 07:58.802
Well said.

07:59.015 --> 08:00.411
Let's take off our shirts and wrestle.

08:07.316 --> 08:08.093
Okay,

08:08.178 --> 08:12.283
give me all your peanuts,Goobers, and Fluffer Nutters.

08:12.485 --> 08:14.181
Oh, why should we have

08:14.198 --> 08:15.520
to give up our salty snacks

08:15.528 --> 08:17.840
just to keep one allergic kid from exploding?

08:17.998 --> 08:19.770
Who is this selfish jerk anyway?

08:19.976 --> 08:21.703
It's not me,I swear.

08:21.767 --> 08:25.552
I'm only allergic to honey,wheat, dairy, non-dairy,

08:25.645 --> 08:27.223
and my own tears.

08:28.858 --> 08:29.710
Oh, no.

08:29.948 --> 08:31.852
Call my allergist...

08:31.987 --> 08:33.462
and my optometrist.

08:35.057 --> 08:37.640
Willie, you can tell me.

08:37.847 --> 08:40.381
Who's the mystery wuss who can't eat peanuts?

08:40.414 --> 08:42.390
I'll never say his name.

08:42.575 --> 08:43.582
"His," eh?

08:43.727 --> 08:45.820
Hmm, sit's a dude.

08:45.987 --> 08:47.692
Who says it's a dude?

08:47.918 --> 08:51.363
A  principal can be a manor a woman these days.

08:51.556 --> 08:52.661
Hmm.

08:55.336 --> 08:57.163
I've taken all the peanut products.

08:57.505 --> 08:59.592
Just like the English took our sheep

08:59.648 --> 09:01.820
and our women in 1291.

09:02.096 --> 09:05.081
Then, they sent them back,which was worse!

09:05.277 --> 09:07.910
Yes, yes,every day we go through this.

09:07.948 --> 09:10.222
Why don't you just incinerate the contraband?

09:10.306 --> 09:13.232
Will do, but first,Willie gets his gob-full.

09:16.608 --> 09:17.890
Carefulwith those peanut crumbs!

09:18.105 --> 09:20.270
My allergy is so sensitive,a single molecule

09:20.285 --> 09:21.293
would make my throat close

09:21.335 --> 09:22.771
like a museum at 4:45.

09:27.777 --> 09:28.873
Hello, Marge.

09:28.975 --> 09:31.471
Picking  up supplies for Handy Homer?

09:31.575 --> 09:34.270
It must feel good to know that you're "helping."

09:34.377 --> 09:37.971
- Oh, I help more than you might think.
- Sure you do.

09:38.077 --> 09:41.420
You provide foodand sexual release
for your handy husband.

09:42.276 --> 09:44.770
Looks like you broke something.
Better call Homer!

09:49.057 --> 09:52.772
Of course I can make a credenza,
what ever that is.

09:52.877 --> 09:56.023
Just give all the details
to my secretary Shirley.

09:56.978 --> 09:57.971
This is Shirley.

09:58.027 --> 10:00.672
Yes, fine, he'll be there tomorrow.
Good-bye.

10:01.175 --> 10:03.172
That Shirley is quite a gal.

10:03.176 --> 10:04.670
We should fix her up with Barney.

10:04.778 --> 10:05.673
Homie...

10:05.678 --> 10:08.872
I think you're taking a little
too much credit for my work.

10:08.978 --> 10:10.471
I mean, look at your t-shirt!

10:12.876 --> 10:17.372
Marge, giving me credit was your idea.
Now, could you rub my butt?

10:17.478 --> 10:20.172
I sat on it so muchit's a little sore.

10:20.176 --> 10:21.173
Oh...!

10:21.177 --> 10:22.823
Look, I'm sorry you're upset,

10:22.827 --> 10:27.671
but if we tell the truth now, I'll be
humiliated in front of the whole town.

10:27.677 --> 10:29.773
Then you won't be married to a man.

10:29.875 --> 10:32.571
You'll be married to some kind of gay jellh,

10:32.576 --> 10:36.973
floating outside the Florida Keys,
cruising for rich snorkelers.

10:37.076 --> 10:40.870
- You don't want that.
- I guess I don't.

10:49.478 --> 10:51.973
Bart, Skinner's going to be really mad at you.

10:52.075 --> 10:56.173
Yes, you might sayhe'll "blow up."

10:58.178 --> 11:00.973
What ever. I've got some paperto m�h�

11:04.676 --> 11:06.572
Simpson! Report to detention at once.

11:06.926 --> 11:09.490
Ah, I'm not a big fan of detention.

11:09.498 --> 11:11.872
You might say it drives mets.

11:13.325 --> 11:14.420
My allergen.

11:15.575 --> 11:21.322
Beat on the brat, at the brat
Beat on the brat with a baseball bat

11:21.378 --> 11:24.622
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh-oh

11:27.478 --> 11:30.873
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh-oh...

11:32.078 --> 11:34.772
I'm a cootie eater.
I've been one all my life.

11:34.975 --> 11:37.622
I like the cooties so much,
I have a cootie wife.

11:42.378 --> 11:47.321
- Why does Lenny need a windmill, anyway?
- Ah, he wants to grind his own corn.

11:47.328 --> 11:51.272
Maybe finally shut him up
about the high price of cornmeal.

11:51.605 --> 11:52.620
Oh, switch.

11:53.178 --> 11:55.470
Oh, yeah,switch, switch, switch.

11:55.878 --> 11:57.672
Wow, great job, Homer.

11:57.727 --> 12:00.173
Yeah, and to think you built this whole
thing with your own two hands.

12:01.176 --> 12:03.171
Who do you think would help me, my wife?

12:03.517 --> 12:05.970
Your wife? Give me a break.

12:06.028 --> 12:08.770
The only thing women can
build is credit card det.

12:10.876 --> 12:11.873
Credit card det.

12:13.177 --> 12:15.370
Homer, did you leave a
powerdrill on in your toolbox?

12:15.378 --> 12:16.522
It's making this horrible e.

12:16.578 --> 12:17.570
Yeah, I hear it, too.

12:17.776 --> 12:20.320
Maybe we cover up by sin a song.

12:20.328 --> 12:23.322
We will, we will rock you

12:26.276 --> 12:29.573
We will, we will rock you

12:32.677 --> 12:34.172
Buddy, you're the boy make a big noise

12:34.176 --> 12:37.120
Playin' in the street
gonna be a big man some day...

12:38.875 --> 12:42.022
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, infinity.

12:42.076 --> 12:44.923
I never expected them
to climb on the cabinet

12:44.928 --> 12:47.172
and ride it down the biggest hill in town.

12:49.477 --> 12:51.973
Homer, it's time people knew the truth.

12:51.977 --> 12:55.122
I'm doing the work and I want the credit.

12:55.175 --> 12:57.473
Look, I understand that you're mad.

12:57.576 --> 12:59.600
Which makes now the
perfect time to tell you,

12:59.606 --> 13:02.873
the mayor's hired to fix
the old Springfield roller coaster.

13:06.178 --> 13:09.170
By the way, nice job installing
this wall-chart bracket.

13:09.475 --> 13:11.822
If the kids ask, I did it.

13:12.578 --> 13:15.522
You're gonna have fix
that roller coaster yourself,

13:15.575 --> 13:19.173
Because I quit,
and I'm taking this with me!

13:22.975 --> 13:25.171
Darn these counter sunk molly clamps.

13:29.777 --> 13:31.822
This is not going to end well.

13:34.087 --> 13:35.472
Now as I see it

13:35.478 --> 13:37.673
The problem with this roller coaster

13:37.677 --> 13:40.470
Is there are too many
boring going-up parts.

13:40.576 --> 13:43.773
We need to replace them with
kick-ass going-down parts.

13:44.328 --> 13:45.670
Oh, yeah,
going-downparts.

13:46.178 --> 13:48.673
Uh, Mr. Simpson, shouldn't we
begin by securing the struts?

13:49.178 --> 13:50.170
Hmm...

13:50.276 --> 13:52.622
Let me mull that over.

13:56.375 --> 14:00.171
What are struts?!
Oh, I don't know.

14:03.078 --> 14:05.370
anything about struts.

14:06.528 --> 14:08.970
This guy's all bubble and no level.

14:09.075 --> 14:11.373
So what? He's paying us 50 grand.

14:11.475 --> 14:13.870
And I promised these guys
money I don't have!

14:14.275 --> 14:16.771
And they're gonna be so mad!

14:19.277 --> 14:20.873
Ah, let's go home.

14:23.175 --> 14:26.773
Maybe I can sneak home
without them seeing me.

14:41.975 --> 14:44.173
Are you ready to belightly assaulted?

14:51.827 --> 14:54.170
Good morning.

14:55.528 --> 14:56.972
I brought you breakfast in bed.

15:00.025 --> 15:01.020
Eat it.

15:08.375 --> 15:10.671
Excuse me. I'm supposed to
stand in your store window

15:10.675 --> 15:13.172
and breast-feed Bilbo Baggins.

15:13.425 --> 15:16.470
Your cowering suggests that
Bart has found your kryptonite.

15:16.478 --> 15:17.821
Kryptonite?
What's that?

15:17.926 --> 15:19.620
The "ite" suffix suggests a mineral.

15:20.028 --> 15:22.171
I do not know whether to laugh
or cry at your ignorance.

15:22.275 --> 15:23.471
I shall laugh. Ha-ha!

15:23.776 --> 15:26.271
Kryptonite is Superman's
greatest weakness.

15:26.928 --> 15:30.370
Wait, maybe Bart has a kryptonite!

15:30.478 --> 15:31.373
Perhaps.

15:31.376 --> 15:33.673
But for now, you may
suckle your Baggins.

15:45.178 --> 15:46.770
I've got you now, Bart.

16:04.175 --> 16:05.473
Dad, here's a thought:

16:05.475 --> 16:08.872
If you just gaom credit,
maybe she could help you.

16:08.876 --> 16:10.571
Sweetie, you don't understand.

16:10.775 --> 16:15.171
If I can do this myself,
then all those lies I told will be true.

16:15.376 --> 16:17.523
Don't you want Daddy's lies to be true?

16:17.775 --> 16:20.520
I'd like a daddy who lived
in the real world.

16:20.526 --> 16:25.673
To Daddy, the real world
gets fainter and fainter every day.

16:27.077 --> 16:28.673
Good morning, Seymour.

16:28.878 --> 16:32.472
You may be wondering what
I'm doing with this hat full of maggots.

16:32.575 --> 16:34.321
Actually, I'm not wondering at all.

16:38.276 --> 16:41.271
Simpson, you've been waving 
your nuts in my face for too long.

16:41.275 --> 16:43.771
- Eat shrimp and die!
- No! I'm allergic!

16:45.128 --> 16:47.922
Stick-on-stick.
Just like the knights of old.

16:48.175 --> 16:50.220
No one teaches me history!

17:35.276 --> 17:36.470
- Peanut?!
- Shrimp?!

17:40.626 --> 17:42.501
If either of us falls in, we're doomed!

17:42.877 --> 17:44.871
Kids don't die!

17:49.427 --> 17:55.273
- I... was... El Barto.
- No...!

17:57.527 --> 18:00.570
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,
honored guests

18:00.776 --> 18:03.570
and out-of-town
roller coaster weir does.

18:07.178 --> 18:09.322
Your father's finally
gonna get exposed

18:09.327 --> 18:11.821
as the credit-stealing fraud he is!

18:17.775 --> 18:18.772
Perfect.

18:18.975 --> 18:22.073
I give you...the Zoominator!

18:24.076 --> 18:26.922
And now to get stinking drunk!

18:35.175 --> 18:36.670
I'm not getting married on that!

18:36.677 --> 18:39.822
You won't get married on Colossus,
you won't get married on The Zoominator,

18:39.828 --> 18:41.720
you won't get married
on The Pharaoh's Curse.

18:41.927 --> 18:44.971
- Just say it. it's me!
- Oh, no, baby, no!

18:45.278 --> 18:51.172
Dad! Put a side your sel fish
male ego and tell the truth!

18:51.178 --> 18:53.520
Sure, I'll tell them the truth.

18:53.627 --> 18:54.622
The truth is...

18:55.428 --> 18:58.670
that I'm perfect and everything
I touch is perfect!

19:00.575 --> 19:02.573
Oh, my God, he'll kill himself!

19:03.078 --> 19:06.623
He'll never hear me say "I told you so!"

19:07.325 --> 19:09.121
I never felt safer!

19:17.625 --> 19:21.471
Oh, why must we preserve
America's historic roller coasters?

19:39.928 --> 19:40.973
Thank you, honey!

19:41.476 --> 19:42.473
Everyone!

19:42.476 --> 19:44.971
My stupid male pride made me lie to you.

19:44.975 --> 19:45.971
Everything I claimed... I did
was actually built by Marge!

19:55.675 --> 19:58.172
Homer, I was pretty upset with you,

19:58.177 --> 20:03.373
but in theend, I... I...
I beam!

20:10.575 --> 20:12.473
Avenge... me.

20:17.176 --> 20:19.170
Marge, I realized something

20:19.178 --> 20:21.173
when I was trapped under all that rubble:

20:21.177 --> 20:24.271
Marriage is the real roller coaster.

20:24.375 --> 20:27.123
I'm just glad I have
you as my safety bar.

20:27.276 --> 20:30.773
Oh, I forgive you, my darling. Get well.

20:32.227 --> 20:36.470
As for you, young man,
the next time you save your principal,

20:36.476 --> 20:38.573
try not to risk your own life.

20:39.226 --> 20:41.370
What kind of lies are you feeding her, Simpson?

20:41.445 --> 20:43.462
Mind your own beeswax!

20:51.775 --> 20:53.672
I'm gonna go look at the new babies.
