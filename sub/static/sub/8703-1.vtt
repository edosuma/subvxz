00:25.992 --> 00:29.111
All: Ahh!

00:38.401 --> 00:40.908
[Airplane engine roaring]

00:42.484 --> 00:44.765
_

00:50.262 --> 00:52.094
Why have you come to Belize?

00:52.130 --> 00:54.087
I've been asking myself that same question.

00:56.851 --> 00:58.582
Seemed like a good idea.

01:01.180 --> 01:03.955
Four days of peace and quiet.

01:04.051 --> 01:06.704
[Telephone ringing]

01:06.976 --> 01:08.172
Drink de rum.

01:08.199 --> 01:09.365
Have de party.

01:09.481 --> 01:10.930
Dance at de...

01:11.092 --> 01:13.020
[without accent] Just hang out.

01:13.052 --> 01:16.041
[Telephone ringing]

01:22.760 --> 01:24.397
I couldn't believe it, a free vacation.

01:24.398 --> 01:25.936
- Uh!
- Jesus Christ.

01:25.959 --> 01:27.551
- Hey, Cobi.
- Nice ass.

01:27.806 --> 01:30.083
Hey, buddy, how you doing, good?

01:30.570 --> 01:31.962
- Hey, Joel.
- Hey, Cobi, hey.

01:31.984 --> 01:33.438
Hey, Gus is right behind me.

01:33.463 --> 01:34.491
I don't know where he is, but...

01:34.587 --> 01:35.638
Did you guys fly in together?

01:35.672 --> 01:38.187
Uh, yeah... well, same
connection from Dallas.

01:38.188 --> 01:39.645
I flew from Indianapolis.

01:39.666 --> 01:40.993
He came from Grand Rapids.

01:41.788 --> 01:43.106
What the hell you doing up there?

01:43.203 --> 01:45.452
- Chasing a dream, bro.
- Oh, yeah?

01:45.548 --> 01:47.253
- They have those up there?
- Yeah, they have them.

01:47.349 --> 01:48.846
I didn't say I didn't know where it was.

01:48.887 --> 01:50.504
I said it's not where I thought it was.

01:50.533 --> 01:51.537
Where did you think it was?

01:51.583 --> 01:53.810
I don't know, some island in
the Caribbean or something.

01:53.906 --> 01:56.041
- We're in Central America.
- I know that now.

01:56.064 --> 01:57.721
They promised that my bag will arrive

01:57.733 --> 01:59.308
with the next flight,
and they'll deliver it.

01:59.339 --> 02:00.942
Oh, somebody's wearing the same clothes

02:00.946 --> 02:01.770
till they get home.

02:01.782 --> 02:03.421
[Scoffs] Still the funny guy.

02:04.321 --> 02:06.548
Man, we're good on maracas,
man. Thank you. I don't get it.

02:06.578 --> 02:07.762
If he can live anywhere he wants to,

02:07.792 --> 02:08.958
why would he choose to live here?

02:08.987 --> 02:10.505
Well, isn't this place
supposed to be, like,

02:10.526 --> 02:13.357
party fucking central,
girls gone wild and shit?

02:13.473 --> 02:15.137
Doubt that. We're on the mosquito coast.

02:15.154 --> 02:16.508
It's all about the taxes.

02:16.543 --> 02:17.564
He's here for a tax break?

02:17.768 --> 02:19.402
The rich retirees he sold the properties to

02:19.448 --> 02:20.825
moved here for the tax breaks,

02:20.831 --> 02:22.436
and now he's staying
here for the tax breaks.

02:22.459 --> 02:24.477
- How do you know?
- Dude, I'm a financial consultant.

02:24.512 --> 02:25.767
I spend all day on this stuff.

02:25.797 --> 02:27.243
If someone told me 20 years ago that people

02:27.243 --> 02:29.846
would entrust Cobi with
their life savings...

02:29.863 --> 02:31.776
I can hear you. I'm right there.

02:35.182 --> 02:36.527
Wow.

02:36.812 --> 02:38.460
- _
- Oh, okay.

02:38.556 --> 02:39.864
You got to be kidding me.

02:39.905 --> 02:41.923
[Chuckles] It's kind of funny.

02:43.132 --> 02:45.221
Who the fuck is he calling a loser anyway?

02:45.913 --> 02:48.168
Look both ways, gentlemen, both ways.

02:48.264 --> 02:50.801
Is this a fully stocked bar I see?

02:51.158 --> 02:52.682
- Nice, look at this.
- Got one for each.

02:52.690 --> 02:54.586
- Nice bag.
- Nice leather.

02:54.600 --> 02:56.686
Didn't know where Belize was, huh?

02:56.782 --> 02:58.312
Take this map. That's for you.

02:58.627 --> 03:01.025
Mango. Fresh mango.

03:01.411 --> 03:04.623
Mango for you.

03:05.396 --> 03:16.051
Here's one for me: "I
need fi buy some draws."

03:16.179 --> 03:20.021
- Draws?
- "I'd like to buy some underwear."

03:21.586 --> 03:27.055
"Dis da where the kruffy bathe nekkid?"

03:27.090 --> 03:32.524
"Where is the nearest nudist beach?"

03:32.560 --> 03:37.745
[Laughter] "Dat deh gal sick."

03:38.385 --> 03:41.207
"She has AIDS."

03:41.253 --> 03:43.496
Oh, man.

03:43.829 --> 03:47.328
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, boo.

03:47.399 --> 03:52.447
- Check that out.
- Hell, yes.

03:52.856 --> 03:57.162
- Yeah, all right.
- Really gonna be doing that?

03:57.218 --> 04:00.185
- Yes, we are.
- I'm doing that.

04:00.235 --> 04:03.437
This has got to be worth seeing, right?

04:03.492 --> 04:06.416
- Yeah.
- Fuck you.

04:06.487 --> 04:08.882
- Sign me up.
- Fuck you.

04:08.894 --> 04:12.246
I'd rather go on my own anyway, so...

04:12.441 --> 04:19.567
- Hey, nice gift, Milo, right?
- We all got one of those?

04:19.762 --> 04:25.133
Come on, Lex, flash me some
ass for old times' sake.

04:25.227 --> 04:28.256
You know what? Excuse me.

04:28.323 --> 04:31.586
Can we pull over to a
Starbucks or something?

04:31.657 --> 04:35.772
Yeah, man, a latte would be great.

04:38.388 --> 04:44.071
[People chattering, laughing]

04:44.270 --> 04:49.297
Is it legal to just have your
cock out on the street like that?

04:49.531 --> 04:53.351
- [Laughter]
- I'm serious.

05:07.269 --> 05:09.034
[Horn honks]

05:19.040 --> 05:20.759
Where the hell is this place?

05:32.691 --> 05:35.562
[Electronic chime]

05:58.201 --> 05:59.668
Hey, Milo!

05:59.686 --> 06:01.684
We're here!

06:14.955 --> 06:16.944
Wow.

06:17.399 --> 06:19.183
That's got to be worth 3 million.

06:19.202 --> 06:21.646
Yeah, but your money
goes further down here.

06:21.666 --> 06:23.934
- It's still in the millions.
- Beautiful.

06:23.964 --> 06:25.380
- Oh, man.
- Are you kidding?

06:25.591 --> 06:28.738
[Laughs] That's ridiculous.

06:28.841 --> 06:30.413
Milo.

06:32.944 --> 06:34.527
Welcome to Belize.

06:36.011 --> 06:38.121
Holy fucking shit.

06:38.170 --> 06:39.752
- Oh, hell yeah.
- [Laughs]

06:39.790 --> 06:41.558
- Wow.
- Hell yeah.

06:41.615 --> 06:42.731
Ooh!

06:42.927 --> 06:44.754
Oh, man.

06:46.175 --> 06:48.106
It's unbelievable.

06:48.841 --> 06:50.352
Look at that.

06:52.841 --> 06:54.746
Great to see you.

06:55.029 --> 06:57.812
All right, all right, when do I move in?

06:58.321 --> 06:59.854
This is pretty impressive.

07:03.769 --> 07:06.263
Of all my friends' beachfront villas,

07:06.280 --> 07:09.650
this is definitely my favorite.

07:09.774 --> 07:12.187
[Laughter]

07:17.088 --> 07:19.761
How's he get to retire at his age?

07:19.886 --> 07:22.476
Apparently he got this
amazing offer for the company

07:22.481 --> 07:23.618
right out of the blue.

07:23.635 --> 07:26.306
24 hours later, boom, sold, just like that.

07:26.334 --> 07:27.669
How do you know?

07:28.076 --> 07:30.134
He called me about three weeks ago

07:30.145 --> 07:31.760
when he was trying to decide what to do.

07:32.106 --> 07:33.439
Why didn't he call me?

07:33.486 --> 07:35.446
An amazing offer out of the blue.

07:35.977 --> 07:37.701
Always was a lucky son of a bitch.

07:37.711 --> 07:39.444
Milo always had smarts. Give him that.

07:39.471 --> 07:42.087
There's no artistry in
selling real estate, Gus.

07:42.202 --> 07:44.527
It's about timing. Anyone could do it.

07:44.545 --> 07:45.609
- Why didn't you do it?
- Exactly.

07:45.642 --> 07:46.776
Yeah, right, like that's me.

07:46.806 --> 07:47.802
Okay.

07:47.860 --> 07:49.151
You got, like, a soda or something?

07:49.304 --> 07:50.942
- Yeah, just inside on the left.
- There you go.

07:51.103 --> 07:51.960
Nice.

07:52.387 --> 07:53.639
You're my first guests.

07:54.530 --> 07:55.515
Good call.

07:55.550 --> 07:57.118
That's what I'm saying.

07:57.962 --> 07:58.908
To old friends.

07:59.003 --> 07:59.771
To Milo,

08:00.038 --> 08:02.024
happy retirement, you lucky bastard,

08:02.039 --> 08:03.965
and for flying us all down here.

08:04.398 --> 08:05.792
You always had a big heart, bro.

08:05.812 --> 08:07.707
- Yeah. Hear, hear.
- Cheers.

08:07.803 --> 08:08.798
Thank you.

08:11.818 --> 08:13.056
Oh, shit.

08:13.095 --> 08:15.170
I told Helena that I'd
call her when I got here.

08:15.200 --> 08:16.602
- Damn it.
- How is Helena?

08:16.700 --> 08:18.506
Uh, fine, says hi.

08:19.362 --> 08:20.902
You get a signal here, Milo?

08:21.016 --> 08:24.170
No, the mountains screw it up,
but you know where you get it?

08:24.287 --> 08:25.542
You see that palm tree over there,

08:25.571 --> 08:26.631
the one that's bending down?

08:26.747 --> 08:28.462
Top of that, sometimes you get a signal.

08:28.864 --> 08:30.334
Oh, all right.

08:33.366 --> 08:35.791
So what are we looking at
here, your own private beach?

08:36.065 --> 08:38.063
Uh, yeah, actually.

08:38.121 --> 08:39.693
You can only get to it by boat.

08:39.923 --> 08:41.725
Closest neighbor is 4 miles that way.

08:41.759 --> 08:42.995
You don't want to walk it, though,

08:43.001 --> 08:44.720
'cause it turns into mangrove swamp.

08:45.539 --> 08:47.722
[Grunting]

08:47.962 --> 08:49.933
- There is no signal, is there?
- Uh, no.

08:50.125 --> 08:51.526
[Laughter]

08:51.852 --> 08:53.183
Got to go higher.

08:53.279 --> 08:55.689
[Grunting]

08:57.584 --> 08:58.730
Keep going.

08:58.846 --> 09:01.308
[Laughs]

09:01.914 --> 09:03.043
All: Oh.

09:03.866 --> 09:05.805
Hey, assholes!

09:05.902 --> 09:07.803
Sorry, man, my bad.

09:07.827 --> 09:09.531
Hut! Hut! Hut!

09:09.627 --> 09:12.838
[Indistinct chatter]

09:13.173 --> 09:15.351
Oh, yeah. What?

09:15.467 --> 09:16.641
Oh, my God.

09:16.756 --> 09:18.068
Oh.

09:18.780 --> 09:21.478
[Exotic music]

09:21.574 --> 09:23.308
â™ª

09:23.404 --> 09:24.850
Oh!

09:24.946 --> 09:26.134
Oh!

09:26.231 --> 09:27.612
Get your ass in the water.

09:27.727 --> 09:29.165
Really, you fuckers?

09:29.442 --> 09:30.952
[Laughter]

09:37.439 --> 09:39.462
Oh!

09:39.559 --> 09:41.496
- All: Cheers.
- Yeah.

09:41.776 --> 09:43.573
Losers, are we? Huh?

09:43.689 --> 09:44.800
Take it.

09:47.813 --> 09:49.155
Gus, you're not gonna change?

09:49.200 --> 09:50.447
Hilarious.

09:51.713 --> 09:53.035
You done good, kid.

09:54.174 --> 09:55.546
At least one of us fucking clowns

09:55.567 --> 09:56.835
finally cracked it, right?

09:57.180 --> 09:57.848
Look,

09:58.513 --> 09:59.431
still buddies.

10:00.356 --> 10:01.755
Don't you think that's pretty special?

10:01.943 --> 10:02.992
Yeah, I do.

10:03.351 --> 10:04.705
I just wish you would have come down here

10:04.721 --> 10:05.855
when I started the business.

10:06.196 --> 10:07.617
You'd have been a great right-hand man.

10:07.955 --> 10:09.521
Lord knows I could have used your help.

10:10.033 --> 10:12.252
Man, if I'd have come
down here three years ago

10:12.279 --> 10:14.058
when you started, right now,

10:14.860 --> 10:17.919
I'd be lying in some skanky dope
house with a pipe in one hand

10:18.035 --> 10:20.755
and some strung-out
beach bunny in the other.

10:21.543 --> 10:23.222
Actually, that sounds pretty good, right?

10:23.289 --> 10:24.837
[Electronic chime]

10:25.092 --> 10:26.215
[Sighs]

10:28.928 --> 10:31.088
- Time to go.
- All right.

10:39.206 --> 10:40.530
Whatever you want, it's on me.

10:40.645 --> 10:42.012
Why don't you let us treat you, Milo?

10:42.032 --> 10:43.236
No, you hold on to your money.

10:43.350 --> 10:44.726
It's not like we can't afford it.

10:44.728 --> 10:47.140
No, really, he's owed me
10 grand for two years.

10:47.557 --> 10:50.109
If he'd just acknowledge it
occasionally, not that I need it.

10:50.127 --> 10:52.768
- I'll order for everyone.
- Or we could order ourselves.

10:52.786 --> 10:53.987
I think we know how the system works:

10:53.987 --> 10:55.526
Waitress, notepad.

10:56.303 --> 10:58.150
- Hi.
- How are you?

10:58.246 --> 10:59.749
- Good to see you again.
- Come here. Meet my friends.

11:00.224 --> 11:01.149
This is Lex.

11:01.264 --> 11:03.023
We grew up, like, two
blocks away from each other,

11:03.051 --> 11:04.908
which means he knows far too much about me.

11:05.003 --> 11:06.453
All the filthy secrets.

11:06.457 --> 11:07.605
Don't listen to a word he says.

11:07.632 --> 11:08.406
This is Joel,

11:08.773 --> 11:12.416
absolutely the smartest,
possibly the kindest guy I know.

11:12.457 --> 11:15.267
- Oh, really?
- And this is Gus, recently divorced,

11:15.276 --> 11:17.379
- so if there's anyone you know who's...
- I'm fine.

11:17.434 --> 11:19.370
- Thank you.
- I've never seen this man before in my life.

11:19.486 --> 11:21.430
Please have him removed from the building.

11:22.379 --> 11:24.476
His name is Cobi, actually,

11:24.518 --> 11:26.077
and he's one of my best friends,

11:26.192 --> 11:27.617
almost was my business partner.

11:35.625 --> 11:37.359
Things get any better

11:37.787 --> 11:39.440
with the kids since you moved?

11:39.662 --> 11:41.264
Not really.

11:41.360 --> 11:44.636
I thought I'd just leave
them alone for a while,

11:45.108 --> 11:48.182
let them come to me when they're ready.

11:48.278 --> 11:50.167
I'm still waiting.

11:50.263 --> 11:51.353
[Sniffs]

11:51.448 --> 11:53.145
[Laughs]

11:53.242 --> 11:54.758

Yes. Yes, I did.

12:21.151 --> 12:21.358
'Cause I didn't hear back from you,

12:21.360 --> 12:21.610

12:21.611 --> 12:21.881
I got the offer for the business,

12:21.883 --> 12:22.178

too good to pass up.

22:23.245 --> 22:24.970
As opposed to what?

22:25.084 --> 22:27.329
It was taking a dip, and it got a cramp?

22:27.444 --> 22:29.018
Go and get it, Cobi.

22:29.131 --> 22:31.169
- Why do I have to do it?
- 'Cause I asked you.

22:31.199 --> 22:32.941
There's shovels in the garage.

22:32.993 --> 22:35.231
Bury it behind those trees over there.

22:35.549 --> 22:36.954
Why don't you bury it?

22:36.960 --> 22:39.300
'Cause I've got to arrange for
someone to disinfect my pool.

22:39.647 --> 22:41.664
Aw, man.

22:47.584 --> 22:48.897
God damn it,

22:48.993 --> 22:51.082
why am I always the fucking guy?

22:51.107 --> 22:53.854
I mean, seriously, I'm always the guy.

22:53.889 --> 22:55.863
- You're the man, Cob.
- Why don't you help out?

22:55.888 --> 22:57.578
I'm coming. I'm coming.

23:01.990 --> 23:04.077
You know, every time I go
on vacation, this happens.

23:04.128 --> 23:05.703
Oh, God!

23:05.744 --> 23:07.811
- Does that make you horny?
- Shut the fuck up.

23:11.363 --> 23:13.210
Ugh.

23:14.083 --> 23:16.653
- Why are we doing this?
- You're not, Joel. I am.

23:16.658 --> 23:18.025
You think he'd have a groundskeeper

23:18.052 --> 23:19.784
or something to take care
of this kind of stuff.

23:19.900 --> 23:21.317
Oh, yeah, you're nothing in Belize

23:21.350 --> 23:23.201
unless you have your own goat burier.

23:23.226 --> 23:24.179
Get out of here.

23:24.196 --> 23:25.631
You realize what's happening, right?

23:25.660 --> 23:27.693
We're all beholden to him now.

23:28.037 --> 23:29.382
Why, because he paid for the trip?

23:29.728 --> 23:31.364
Oh, that's right. You weren't there.

23:31.694 --> 23:33.259
- He said he's leaving us the villa.
- Shoo.

23:33.374 --> 23:33.884
Go away.

23:33.914 --> 23:35.086
- What?
- Yeah.

23:35.269 --> 23:36.452
When did he say that?

23:36.550 --> 23:38.543
When you were balls deep in a tween.

23:40.024 --> 23:40.953
I mean, really, Cobi,

23:40.977 --> 23:42.388
how are we supposed to
look Helena in the eye?

23:42.424 --> 23:44.015
I can't think of reason
why you'd need to look her

23:44.034 --> 23:46.036
in the eye, Joel, but, you
know, thanks for caring. Wait.

23:47.269 --> 23:48.628
He's giving us the villa?

23:48.646 --> 23:50.918
He said if anything happens
to him, he'd leave it to us.

23:50.952 --> 23:52.543
You don't think he's
sick or anything, do you,

23:52.707 --> 23:54.441
and that's why he's got us all here?

23:54.450 --> 23:56.537
He got us here to show off. It's obvious.

23:56.552 --> 23:58.389
- Joel's jealous.
- [Grunts]

23:58.714 --> 23:59.721
Asshole.

23:59.957 --> 24:02.152
- My new glasses.
- You want to fight?

24:02.878 --> 24:05.256
Don't fucking touch me, man.

24:31.714 --> 24:33.036
Nice house.

24:37.867 --> 24:40.781
Oh, listen, a friend of
mine offered us his boat.

24:40.787 --> 24:42.636
I figured we'd go pick up some supplies,

24:42.732 --> 24:44.660
go fishing, motor up the coast.

24:44.695 --> 24:45.978
Guatemala's two hours that way.

24:46.014 --> 24:47.467
Sure you don't want us to stay here

24:47.582 --> 24:48.937
and dig another hole for you?

24:48.968 --> 24:50.501
I'll see you downstairs in half an hour.

24:50.665 --> 24:52.206
Bring your bathing suits.

24:55.915 --> 24:56.908
Hey.

24:59.918 --> 25:01.097
What's up with the box?

25:01.212 --> 25:02.396
It's paperwork.

25:02.511 --> 25:04.092
It has to do with the sale of the company.

25:04.121 --> 25:07.062
Ah, hey, the guys told me
what you said last night

25:07.178 --> 25:09.048
about leaving us the villa.

25:09.073 --> 25:10.465
Yeah, it's yours, man.

25:10.502 --> 25:12.830
Well, obviously, I hope it never is,

25:13.265 --> 25:16.323
but, I mean, I appreciate the gesture.

25:18.446 --> 25:19.679
Is everything okay?

25:20.955 --> 25:22.844
You know, you should
bring Helena down here.

25:22.897 --> 25:23.952
What?

25:24.049 --> 25:25.191
Oh.

25:25.841 --> 25:28.676
Uh, yeah, she'd love it.

25:29.040 --> 25:31.669
You ever think about her and Joel,

25:31.699 --> 25:32.914
how they used to date?

25:33.349 --> 25:34.585
20 years ago?

25:34.614 --> 25:36.525
Yeah, but he really loved her.

25:36.576 --> 25:39.667
You ever wonder if they keep in touch?

25:42.452 --> 25:43.955
Guatemala.

25:44.050 --> 25:46.369
You said it was, what,
two hours away from here?

25:46.377 --> 25:48.359
- Are you happy, Cobi?
- Yeah.

25:48.474 --> 25:49.972
Why wouldn't I be?

25:51.124 --> 25:53.603
I just wondered if you ever regretted

25:54.003 --> 25:57.256
not getting involved with this, with me

25:57.813 --> 25:59.285
when you had the chance.

26:02.348 --> 26:04.212
You really didn't want to take
that risk, though, did you?

26:07.317 --> 26:08.277
I don't know. I guess...

26:08.374 --> 26:10.348
I don't really think about it.

26:10.806 --> 26:12.360
Maybe you should.

26:13.079 --> 26:15.142
Maybe you should next time you're

26:15.414 --> 26:17.233
sitting in your little office

26:17.473 --> 26:19.390
with its vertical blinds and its

26:19.665 --> 26:22.686
fluorescent lighting and its lunch hours.

26:26.518 --> 26:29.749
I'm just busting your balls.
Come here. You did good.

26:29.863 --> 26:31.464
- Yeah.
- You did all right.

26:31.464 --> 26:32.970
Yeah.

26:33.593 --> 26:36.918
At least you're not
bullshitting us like Gus, right?

26:37.808 --> 26:38.998
Gus.

26:39.625 --> 26:40.761
Eh.

26:40.856 --> 26:42.630

26:42.745 --> 26:44.299
Okay.

26:49.145 --> 26:50.392
Yeah!

26:50.489 --> 26:52.635
- Oh, that's nice.
- Oh, faster, faster.

- Yeah.

- No, I'm good.

- Need me to help?
- No.

No?

27:05.175 --> 27:06.829
- This one?
- Uh-uh.

27:06.856 --> 27:08.124

Oh, man.

27:30.817 --> 27:33.118
Two against one.

27:36.606 --> 27:37.968
Yeah, so I started playing golf.

27:38.003 --> 27:38.721
[Laughs] No.

27:38.899 --> 27:40.265
It's great for taking clients out.

27:40.302 --> 27:42.105
- You any good?
- Nah, you don't want to be.

27:42.220 --> 27:45.407
- You got to let them win.
- Jesus, listen to you guys.

27:45.451 --> 27:47.702
Don't any of you have any ambition left?

27:47.740 --> 27:49.157
Maybe we're happy with who we are.

27:49.186 --> 27:50.768
Where's the fire in your belly, huh?

27:50.791 --> 27:51.935
- Cobi?
- What?

27:51.958 --> 27:53.524
You don't know about fire in your belly,

27:53.536 --> 27:55.095
but I'll tell you what,
you're gonna find fire

27:55.111 --> 27:56.274
in your cock, aren't you?

27:56.323 --> 27:57.363
Yeah.

"Here, Helena, I brought you
a present back from Belize:"

28:00.222 --> 28:01.482
- "Gonorrhea."
- Easy.

28:01.509 --> 28:03.453
Guess you better hope that
Joel doesn't go tell her.

28:03.624 --> 28:05.183
Fuck's sake, man.

28:06.042 --> 28:07.820
So, Milo, this boat dude,

28:07.843 --> 28:09.280
is he, like, a good buddy or what?

28:09.347 --> 28:10.425
Not really.

28:11.069 --> 28:13.391
To be honest, most of them
down here are total cunts.

28:14.423 --> 28:15.448
The place attracts them.

28:16.002 --> 28:17.392
Then why'd he lend you the boat?

28:18.189 --> 28:19.040
He didn't.

28:20.407 --> 28:21.832
Someone put a goat in my pool.

28:37.349 --> 28:40.070
Are you saying we stole this boat?

28:40.308 --> 28:42.233
Milo, that doesn't sound smart, bro.

28:42.273 --> 28:44.004
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Just take it easy.

28:44.045 --> 28:45.313
I'm just flexing a little muscle.

28:45.327 --> 28:47.580
You do remember how to
do that, don't you, Joel?

28:47.631 --> 28:49.816
You just implicated us in piracy!

28:50.380 --> 28:51.603
Jesus Christ, Milo.

28:51.608 --> 28:53.801
I cannot believe I chose you guys

28:53.816 --> 28:55.538
to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with me.

28:55.556 --> 28:57.405
No, no, no, some of us

what's going on down here,

29:00.789 --> 29:01.601
but can we just...

29:01.607 --> 29:02.968
- Take us back now!
- Do it, Milo.

29:02.983 --> 29:04.042
Just take us back.

29:05.450 --> 29:06.510
Or what?

29:16.457 --> 29:18.538
You do it.

the reefs and the mud flats,

- No?
- Why you being such a prick?

29:45.611 --> 29:47.224
No, you don't get to call me that, see,

like that, tell us first.

when you eventually tell this
guy where the boat is, you know,

32:26.301 --> 32:29.983
you don't need to mention, like, us, right?

32:29.983 --> 32:32.081
Gus was telling me that
you're lonely, Joel,

32:32.314 --> 32:34.783

I don't have to have
loyalty to him or any of you.

34:45.802 --> 34:46.856
Wow,

34:47.931 --> 34:49.580
thank you, man. Jesus.

34:49.639 --> 34:51.683
If that's the way you feel, why the
fuck did you even come down here?

34:51.703 --> 34:53.033
You want to know why? Because Gus

34:53.074 --> 34:55.380
said he wouldn't come unless
I came. I'm sorry, Gus.

34:55.402 --> 34:57.569
I didn't want to be the reason
that he didn't get a vacation.

34:57.603 --> 34:59.449
No, don't turn this shit around on me, bro.

34:59.471 --> 35:00.365
You didn't want to come either?

35:00.407 --> 35:03.562
I wasn't sure if I was
gonna be able to come.

35:04.995 --> 35:06.483
The man just willed us his villa.

35:06.533 --> 35:07.487
If you believe that, you're a moron.

35:07.506 --> 35:09.054
Maybe he just got overexcited

35:09.095 --> 35:10.372
because we're all here.

35:17.407 --> 35:18.815
We're going home.

35:21.028 --> 35:23.539
So if you could... if you
could call us a ride...

35:27.284 --> 35:29.037
You all want to go?

35:29.655 --> 35:31.070
If you do, that's fine.

35:31.165 --> 35:33.677
It's just that Joel has a habit
of speaking for all of you.

35:34.246 --> 35:36.325
- He can't help it. It's his inner-teacher.
- Naw...

35:37.835 --> 35:39.463
we all want to split.

35:39.580 --> 35:40.646
All right,

35:40.762 --> 35:42.950
the flight's at 11:00.
I'll make sure you're on it.

35:43.304 --> 35:45.218
Can I make a suggestion, though?

35:45.314 --> 35:46.674
Stay for dinner?

35:46.944 --> 35:48.763
Let me explain today.

35:50.536 --> 35:52.212
Your ride will come in time

35:52.309 --> 35:54.450
to get you to your flight.

35:55.068 --> 35:56.566
Fair enough?

36:33.956 --> 36:35.360
All right.

36:38.450 --> 36:40.275
I'm sorry.

36:40.975 --> 36:42.701
I know I pissed you guys off,

36:43.685 --> 36:46.269
and if there's any way
I can make it right...

36:50.431 --> 36:52.134
- I guess I misjudged...
- Us,

36:52.624 --> 36:54.242
yes.

36:54.819 --> 36:56.641
You know, that's not really
what I was about to say,

36:56.667 --> 36:58.889
but thank you for interrupting me, Joel.

36:59.004 --> 37:00.922
[Soft slurping]

37:03.422 --> 37:05.625
- You sure you want all that?
- Mm-hmm.

37:06.015 --> 37:09.108
Yes, I am, but thank you, mom.

37:11.985 --> 37:13.351
Can I

37:13.465 --> 37:16.325
- speak honestly to you all about something?
- I doubt it.

37:16.440 --> 37:19.053
- Would you just fuck right off?
- Joel... Milo,

37:19.053 --> 37:20.831
- just say what you were gonna
say. I mean, no, forget it.

37:21.094 --> 37:24.163
Wait for your cab, and
then go home, would you?

37:38.103 --> 37:40.345
When you gonna get out there again, huh?

37:40.564 --> 37:41.938
Out where?

37:42.312 --> 37:43.319
Dating.

37:43.356 --> 37:45.341
Oh. [Laughs]

37:45.743 --> 37:47.661
I hadn't really given
that a lot of thought.

37:48.938 --> 37:50.761
Hey, remember that French chick

37:50.771 --> 37:52.538
you used to see before Lindsay? Um...

37:52.653 --> 37:54.022
Uh, Kehme.

37:54.136 --> 37:56.003
She was batshit crazy.

37:56.101 --> 37:57.602
[Laughter]

37:57.698 --> 38:00.654
- Mind you, they're the best in bed.
- The French?

38:00.672 --> 38:02.413
- The lunatics.
- [Laughter]

38:02.528 --> 38:04.753
Can't beat low self-esteem in the sack.

38:05.723 --> 38:07.418
They're up for anything.

38:08.760 --> 38:12.279
Your Kayla was probably
like that, wasn't she, Lex?

38:15.488 --> 38:18.263
- Why would you say that?
- 'Cause she tried to cut her wrists.

38:18.272 --> 38:20.555
- Can't get lower self-esteem than that. What?
- That's off limits.

38:20.588 --> 38:22.127
No. If you're gonna do it, you do it.

38:22.144 --> 38:24.603
- Could you not talk about that, please?
- For, like, the next 45 minutes?

38:24.718 --> 38:26.444
What else should we talk about?

38:33.144 --> 38:35.467
How about how Joel is
still in love with Helena?

38:35.476 --> 38:36.944
Why do you keep bringing her up?

38:36.981 --> 38:38.050
I don't need to listen to this,

38:38.058 --> 38:40.053
and thank you for including me,

38:40.169 --> 38:41.505
but I don't want any part of your villa.

38:41.542 --> 38:42.503
- You don't want it?
- No.

38:42.530 --> 38:44.307
No. Of course you don't. You know why?

38:44.307 --> 38:45.759
Because you always thought
you were better than me,

38:45.810 --> 38:47.472
more deserving, and for the life of you,

38:47.567 --> 38:50.162
you cannot figure out why I have all this,

38:50.183 --> 38:52.336
and you got... What?

38:52.362 --> 38:54.623
How ironic that the
person who has everything

38:54.644 --> 38:58.326
- is so desperately unhappy.
- You are so ecstatic.

38:58.341 --> 39:00.565
You have five fucking bedrooms,
but you still can't sleep.

39:00.579 --> 39:01.825
"I want my Helena back"?

39:01.853 --> 39:05.290
Why don't you go back to
your midwestern duplex, Joel,

39:05.319 --> 39:07.349
and mark off the days
until you got the balls

39:07.363 --> 39:10.144
to take the overdose.
And, Cobi, what are you?

39:10.160 --> 39:11.856
You're like some puffed-up,
low-level accountant?

39:11.897 --> 39:14.793
[Slams] I'm a financial consultant.

39:14.997 --> 39:16.541
Jesus Christ, Milo, you know,

39:16.557 --> 39:19.429
you've been on my case
since I fucking got here!

39:20.133 --> 39:22.388
Just... you know what? Just spew it out,

39:22.503 --> 39:24.825
because you clearly got a bug
up your ass about something.

39:24.861 --> 39:27.183
You think you are this
big fish in a small pond...

39:27.209 --> 39:29.013
- Okay.
- And that is what you are...

39:29.055 --> 39:30.505
- you are pond life.
- Whatever, fine.

39:30.620 --> 39:33.187
Lexi, I love you, bro, but you are a loser,

39:33.283 --> 39:35.725
and what pisses me off
more than anything else

39:35.776 --> 39:37.533
is how comfortable you are with that,

39:37.629 --> 39:41.130
so you go back to whoever's
couch it is you're crashing on

39:41.144 --> 39:43.479
or weekend drum circle, and, Gus...

39:43.514 --> 39:45.747
- I've been waiting for this all day.
- You are a fraud.

39:45.863 --> 39:49.121
You are living this
gigantic lie in your suit

39:49.236 --> 39:52.167
with your fucking fountain
pen, and you lie to us,

39:52.282 --> 39:54.463
and what's worse is you lie
to yourself, and about what?

39:54.477 --> 39:57.000
Because you can't face the
fact that you fucked up?

39:57.017 --> 39:59.113
That you had it all? You lost it.

40:01.862 --> 40:03.565
You made your choices.

40:06.562 --> 40:07.968
I made mine.

40:11.525 --> 40:13.029
Now, get the fuck out of my house.

40:20.723 --> 40:22.568
A cat just walked in.

40:30.761 --> 40:32.779
[Accented man] Where is the boat?

40:34.273 --> 40:37.030
I have no idea what you're talking about.

40:37.125 --> 40:38.726
[Gunshot]

41:31.326 --> 41:33.042
Open your mouth.

42:05.433 --> 42:08.474
[Whimpering]

42:36.070 --> 42:38.272
Don't bother with the police.

42:38.369 --> 42:40.289
We are the police.

42:42.864 --> 42:44.798
24 hour.

42:45.410 --> 42:47.003
Bring us that boat...

42:49.475 --> 42:50.907
Or...

42:51.498 --> 42:52.768
Puhh!

43:42.096 --> 43:43.648
Milo.

43:45.839 --> 43:47.278
He's dead, Joel.

43:47.394 --> 43:48.949
You can't die on us.

43:48.986 --> 43:51.014
Half his head came apart.

44:34.546 --> 44:37.512
- Where's the... we got to call the police.
- He is the police.

44:37.795 --> 44:39.915
The police don't go
around in fucking cat masks

44:40.031 --> 44:42.245
- shooting people!
- He left in a police boat!

44:42.281 --> 44:44.339
- We'll go to the embassy and explain.
- No, you don't get it.

44:44.379 --> 44:46.055
He blew Milo's head off

44:46.171 --> 44:47.693
because we took the boat.

44:47.711 --> 44:49.907
They'll have a 24-hour
emergency line or someth...

44:50.917 --> 44:52.513
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

44:52.629 --> 44:53.921
- Ow. Ow.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

44:54.020 --> 44:56.670
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

45:05.211 --> 45:07.950
Uh, what do you think their 911 is?

45:09.507 --> 45:11.415
- I'll try 911.
- Put the down the phone!

45:11.474 --> 45:13.248
Motherfucker took my DNA.

45:13.294 --> 45:15.831
He can use that to place
the black guy from Chicago

45:15.860 --> 45:17.103
in any crime scene he wants,

45:17.220 --> 45:19.114
so you can't call the police, Joel.

45:19.172 --> 45:21.788
- There'll be an investigation.
- We want an investigation!

45:21.832 --> 45:23.882
By a third world police force?

45:24.268 --> 45:26.153
Milo just left us this villa, man,

45:26.177 --> 45:27.439
his four broke-ass friends.

45:27.445 --> 45:29.013
We turn up, and then this?

45:33.218 --> 45:35.009
I'm being framed for murder.

45:35.038 --> 45:36.108
- By who?
- I don't know!

45:36.108 --> 45:38.397
- Let's go. Let's just go.
- If we run,

45:38.513 --> 45:39.971
they will track us down.

45:39.981 --> 45:42.146
- The cat?
- Yes, Lex, the cat,

45:42.156 --> 45:44.394
who may or may not be the fucking police.

45:44.430 --> 45:45.941
Does Belize have an extradition...

45:45.948 --> 45:47.722
You would know that.
You were a lawyer. You...

45:47.757 --> 45:49.437
Corporate. I did tax fraud.

45:49.461 --> 45:51.164
Well, maybe that'd come up in your class?

45:51.179 --> 45:53.295
Maybe it did! How the fuck would I know?

45:53.346 --> 45:54.729
- Then Google it!
- If you do that,

45:54.758 --> 45:57.144
there will be an online record of us

45:57.260 --> 46:00.637
searching for extradition,
which makes us more guilty!

46:00.677 --> 46:01.335
Listen.

46:02.516 --> 46:04.971
He would have killed us
if he wanted to, right?

46:05.899 --> 46:07.890
He just wants his boat back,

46:09.526 --> 46:10.991
so that's what we do.

46:13.112 --> 46:14.737
We get rid of the body

46:15.348 --> 46:16.826
in case somebody shows up.

46:18.094 --> 46:19.815
We clean this place up,

46:20.961 --> 46:23.982
and then we bring the
boat back to the marina.

46:27.409 --> 46:28.623
Then we get the...

46:29.480 --> 46:31.118
Fuck out of here.

46:32.294 --> 46:33.462
We go home,

46:33.774 --> 46:35.176
get on with our lives.

46:37.537 --> 46:39.253
We don't have to

46:39.455 --> 46:42.466
see each other or talk
about this ever again.

46:51.181 --> 46:53.182
Ugh.

47:41.437 --> 47:42.826
[Splash]

47:43.029 --> 47:44.274
[Clank]

48:06.200 --> 48:08.273
[Sobbing]

48:41.706 --> 48:43.046
[Sighs]

48:52.734 --> 48:54.130
- Hi.
- Hi.

48:57.132 --> 48:59.642
Uh, is Mr. Milo at home?

49:00.286 --> 49:01.930
Uh, no. He's away.

49:02.032 --> 49:04.609
- Oh, I didn't know.
- Yeah, he's not here.

49:05.564 --> 49:07.818
We're house-sitting, so...

49:08.746 --> 49:11.742
- Ay! You hurt your arm.
- Oh, right, it  was

49:11.846 --> 49:13.296
too many beers.

49:13.504 --> 49:15.221
Or maybe you were fighting?

49:15.443 --> 49:17.847
American men, you love to fight, no?

49:22.757 --> 49:25.785
So, right, you don't need to clean today,

49:25.802 --> 49:28.580
'cause we had a party last night, and

49:28.699 --> 49:32.452
so we already cleaned
up. It's... it's clean.

49:33.035 --> 49:35.525
- Why?
- We didn't think it would be nice

49:35.622 --> 49:36.703
to leave you with a big mess.

49:36.730 --> 49:38.829
Oh, no, I mean, why did you have a party?

49:40.192 --> 49:40.768
Oh...

49:40.809 --> 49:42.336
- It was my birthday.
- We're having a reunion.

49:42.924 --> 49:44.623
- Well, it was his birthday.
- And a reunion.

49:44.720 --> 49:45.641
Both.

49:47.067 --> 49:47.847
Ah.

49:48.803 --> 49:50.254
So why don't you just...

49:50.317 --> 49:52.399
you can take the day off. I mean, it's...

49:52.418 --> 49:53.602
[Woman giggles]

49:54.179 --> 49:56.355
Actually, I'm not your housekeeper.

49:59.578 --> 50:01.008
We're looking for a boat

50:01.494 --> 50:02.599
that has been stolen,

50:02.615 --> 50:06.013
and we thought maybe Mr. Milo
could help with our investigation.

50:06.438 --> 50:07.326
He's where?

50:08.238 --> 50:09.465
Guatemala.

50:09.564 --> 50:11.276
He's, um, showing a property.

50:11.332 --> 50:12.392
He'll be back...

50:12.862 --> 50:14.592
Uh, what is it... the day after tomorrow.

50:15.149 --> 50:16.242
Oh, okay.

50:16.521 --> 50:17.682
I'll come back then.

50:19.320 --> 50:21.317
Excuse me, um,

50:21.475 --> 50:24.327
why would Milo know
anything about a stolen boat?

50:24.577 --> 50:26.004
I don't know. Maybe he doesn't.

50:26.165 --> 50:27.853
Whoever took it must be crazy.

50:27.970 --> 50:29.859
It belongs to a man named Jesus.

50:29.876 --> 50:32.217
He's very dangerous, a psychopath.

50:32.674 --> 50:33.876
When people cross him,

50:33.899 --> 50:35.396
he cuts off their hands and their feet,

50:35.784 --> 50:36.698
so

50:37.425 --> 50:38.705
I'm sure it will appear.

50:41.744 --> 50:43.501
Okay, bye.

50:59.881 --> 51:01.939
I'm getting out of here.

51:02.068 --> 51:04.399
Jesus fucking Christ!

51:04.514 --> 51:06.175
- Lex, I need some pants.
- What?

51:06.193 --> 51:07.500
I burned my suit. I need some pants.

51:07.548 --> 51:09.139
- I burned my pants.
- Wait.

51:09.252 --> 51:10.652
I'm getting back to
Chicago if I've got to walk

51:10.671 --> 51:12.290
- through fucking Mexico!
- Stop. Wait.

51:12.323 --> 51:13.550
Joel, I can't get on a plane without pants.

51:13.572 --> 51:15.015
- I left my camera on the boat.
- You got any cash?

51:15.057 --> 51:16.682
The camera, I left it on the boat!

51:16.714 --> 51:18.476
All right, who gives a
shit? You can have mine then.
