(overlapping news transmissions)
<i>a very sophisticated</i>

00:17.283 --> 00:18.517
(gunfire, indistinct chatter)

00:22.489 --> 00:23.989
Man:
Dittmann,

00:23.991 --> 00:25.657
Hold your
fire.

00:25.659 --> 00:27.626
Streeter wants to see you.

00:27.628 --> 00:29.628
Me?

00:29.630 --> 00:31.196
You. Now.

00:36.136 --> 00:37.669
(knocking)

00:37.671 --> 00:39.738
(door opens)

00:41.808 --> 00:44.710
Man:
I got lincoln dittmann
here, boss.

00:46.079 --> 00:48.414
(chuckles)
what's the matter?

00:48.416 --> 00:52.017
You all look like your d-dog
died or something.

00:52.019 --> 00:53.886
Some kind of problem?

00:53.888 --> 00:55.554
Russell here thinks so.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.656
He says you've been talking
trash about the citizens' army

00:57.658 --> 00:59.091
Of virginia.

00:59.093 --> 01:00.926
(laughs)

01:00.928 --> 01:02.528
Oh, you think that's funny?

01:02.530 --> 01:05.531
Come on, russell. All I said was
I'm tired of shooting

01:05.533 --> 01:08.000
P-p-paper targets.

01:08.002 --> 01:10.836
I came here 'cause I heard
you were the ones

01:10.838 --> 01:13.172
Who blew up that federal
building in wichita,

01:13.174 --> 01:15.107
But all I've seen so far
is a bunch

01:15.109 --> 01:18.243
Of wannabes who don't want
to do anything real.

01:18.245 --> 01:20.079
The founding father's
gonna change all that.

01:20.081 --> 01:23.282
The f-f-founding father?

01:23.284 --> 01:25.284
That's right.

01:25.286 --> 01:27.853
He's ready to start a fire
that's gonna burn down

01:27.855 --> 01:29.588
The so-called government.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.256
Well...
(chuckles)

01:31.258 --> 01:34.793
All I can say is, what took him
so long? (chuckles)

01:34.795 --> 01:39.231
I mean, that's all I've been
waiting for since I got here,

01:39.233 --> 01:42.000
The chance to blow some shit up.

01:43.636 --> 01:46.138
I'm in. You just tell me
what you need me to do.

01:46.140 --> 01:48.240
I'll do it.

01:48.242 --> 01:50.242
Anything, okay? Anything.

01:50.244 --> 01:52.311
(gun cocks)
even die?

01:52.313 --> 01:55.481
Talk is talk,
and you sure talk

01:55.483 --> 01:56.582
A lot.

01:56.584 --> 01:58.250
But how far
are you willing to go

01:58.252 --> 01:59.318
For the cause?

02:07.594 --> 02:12.264
I worked c-construction
for 15 years.

02:12.266 --> 02:15.534
Then they gave my job
to some wetback.

02:17.303 --> 02:18.971
My wife left me,

02:18.973 --> 02:20.973
Took my daughter with her.

02:20.975 --> 02:22.307
(chuckles)

02:22.309 --> 02:24.977
I ain't got nothing to lose.

02:24.979 --> 02:28.280
Life's a bitch, lincoln.

02:28.282 --> 02:30.449
But no one trash-talks

02:30.451 --> 02:32.718
The citizens'
army of virginia.

02:35.788 --> 02:37.356
(click)

02:37.358 --> 02:39.158
(laughter)

02:41.161 --> 02:44.129
You got big
balls, lincoln.

02:44.131 --> 02:46.498
I'll give you that.

02:46.500 --> 02:49.468
Come on.
(chuckles)

02:49.470 --> 02:51.170
Is this how this works?

02:51.172 --> 02:52.538
Huh?

02:52.540 --> 02:54.373
Does that mean I'm in?

02:54.375 --> 02:56.542
It means the founding father
wants to meet you.

02:56.544 --> 02:59.311
Well, when?

02:59.313 --> 03:01.113
Tomorrow.

03:01.115 --> 03:02.314
(boom)

03:02.316 --> 03:03.649
What the hell?

03:03.651 --> 03:04.816
Man (over speaker):
This is the atf.

03:04.818 --> 03:05.984
Get on the ground!

03:05.986 --> 03:07.486
Hands on your head
and drop your weapons!

03:07.488 --> 03:09.588
Atf!

03:10.690 --> 03:12.658
Streeter, we got
to get you out of here.

03:12.660 --> 03:14.726
Come on!
Come on!

03:16.029 --> 03:17.729
(gunfire)

03:17.731 --> 03:20.499
Let's go! This way!
Atf! Get on
the ground!

03:20.501 --> 03:21.600
(grunts)

03:29.676 --> 03:30.876
(gunshot)
(grunts)

03:30.878 --> 03:33.445
(gunshot)
(grunts)

03:35.582 --> 03:38.717
I'd have appreciated a heads-up
the atf was coming.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.719
(british accent):
I didn't know.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.187
(panting)

03:42.189 --> 03:44.423
I have no idea why they're here.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.893
Lose the gun, russell. Lose it.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.895
Put your hands on your head.
Do it now.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.199
Don't move! Do not even breathe!

03:54.201 --> 03:56.902
Easy, boys. I'm fbi.

03:56.904 --> 03:59.037
Covert
operations.

03:59.039 --> 04:01.106
And he's with me.

04:01.108 --> 04:03.041
Clearance code

04:03.043 --> 04:05.310
Foxtrot-echo-zulu.

04:06.346 --> 04:08.614
Dispatch, I need
cover code confirmation.

04:08.616 --> 04:10.415
Foxtrot-echo-zulu.

04:10.417 --> 04:12.517
Woman:
Copy that. Checking now.

04:12.519 --> 04:14.353
Six months.

04:14.355 --> 04:16.355
That's how long
I've been under,

04:16.357 --> 04:18.357
Six months.

04:18.359 --> 04:21.593
And you blow my cover
for a weapons bust.

04:21.595 --> 04:25.731
Foxtrot-echo-zulu cleared, sir.

04:25.733 --> 04:27.933
We came here
to serve a warrant

04:27.935 --> 04:30.269
To seize illegal firearms.
We're not taking the fall

04:30.271 --> 04:32.104
For this.
You're more worried
about covering your ass

04:32.106 --> 04:33.905
Than stopping
a terrorist attack.

04:33.907 --> 04:35.574
What are you talking about?
What terrorist attack?
(click)

04:35.576 --> 04:36.775
(groans)

04:36.777 --> 04:38.143
Grenade!

04:45.451 --> 04:47.519
So, who are you?

04:49.789 --> 04:51.790
Martin odum.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.292
(panting)

04:53.294 --> 04:55.360
Call it in.

05:20.953 --> 05:23.722
(birds chirping)

05:31.664 --> 05:32.964
Hey, kid.
(chuckles)

05:32.966 --> 05:34.032
Dad!

05:34.034 --> 05:35.834
Come here.
(chuckles)

05:35.836 --> 05:37.169
Hey, look at you.

05:37.171 --> 05:39.037
I didn't know you were coming.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.339
I missed you.

05:40.341 --> 05:42.341
I'm sorry I didn't call, but...

05:42.343 --> 05:44.009
I thought about you every day.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.677
Did you get 'em? The bad guys?

05:45.679 --> 05:48.513
Yeah.

05:48.515 --> 05:49.981
Yeah, I got 'em.

05:49.983 --> 05:51.983
I knew you would.
Wow, look at you.

05:51.985 --> 05:53.852
Six months, you
must've grown a foot.

05:53.854 --> 05:56.021
A half inch since you left.
I've been keeping track.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.823
(chuckles)
and, dad, I can do
this trick with the ball

05:57.825 --> 05:59.358
Where I can,
like, flip it.

05:59.360 --> 06:02.227
I mean, I can almost do it,
but I just need to work on it.

06:02.229 --> 06:04.296
Yeah, I
saw you.

06:06.699 --> 06:08.767
Martin.

06:09.702 --> 06:10.836
Hi, sonya.

06:10.838 --> 06:12.704
Hey, I, uh...

06:12.706 --> 06:15.607
Just brought around your check.

06:17.143 --> 06:19.211
Go inside so I can talk
to your dad, honey.

06:19.213 --> 06:20.379
Mom,

06:20.381 --> 06:21.646
He just got here.
That's okay, aiden.

06:21.648 --> 06:23.014
I can't stay.

06:23.016 --> 06:25.016
Listen, maybe I'll cook
you dinner tomorrow night,

06:25.018 --> 06:26.418
Huh? Chinese.

06:26.420 --> 06:28.854
Huh?
Awesome. Can't wait.

06:28.856 --> 06:29.721
See you then.

06:29.723 --> 06:32.124
(chuckles)

06:33.259 --> 06:34.526
Didn't know you were back.

06:34.528 --> 06:35.761
I'm sorry. I should've...

06:35.763 --> 06:37.095
You can't just pop
back up

06:37.097 --> 06:39.097
After months of being gone

06:39.099 --> 06:41.566
And expect everything
to be the same.

06:41.568 --> 06:44.770
They're not.
I'm sorry. I'll get going.

06:45.738 --> 06:47.672
Martin,

06:47.674 --> 06:50.075
You signed the check
lincoln dittmann?

06:50.077 --> 06:52.377
What?

06:52.379 --> 06:54.980
You signed the check
lincoln dittmann.

06:58.117 --> 07:00.085
(martin speaking mandarin)

07:18.471 --> 07:20.138
Martin, where you going? Hey,

07:20.140 --> 07:21.440
Your grocery!

07:24.110 --> 07:26.178
(indistinct chatter)

07:49.969 --> 07:53.038
(phone ringing)

07:54.774 --> 07:56.908
Yeah.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.310
It's russell.

07:58.312 --> 08:00.445
I told you not
to use this number.

08:00.447 --> 08:01.680
You dumped lincoln's cell.

08:01.682 --> 08:03.448
How else am I supposed
to contact you?

08:03.450 --> 08:05.016
I'm calling
from a pay phone anyway.

08:05.018 --> 08:06.351
What do you want, russell?

08:06.353 --> 08:08.019
Streeter reached out to me
this morning.

08:08.021 --> 08:10.388
The citizens' army
is back in business.

08:12.325 --> 08:15.293
Russell, be smart
for once in your life.

08:15.295 --> 08:17.095
Walk away.

08:17.097 --> 08:19.498
The founding father wants a
sit-down with lincoln dittmann.

08:19.500 --> 08:20.999
Face-to-face. Tomorrow.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.534
Sit-down for what?

08:22.536 --> 08:25.504
Streeter says after the atf
raid, we got to hit back hard.

08:25.506 --> 08:27.172
He says this is the big one,

08:27.174 --> 08:29.574
What they were planning before.

08:30.543 --> 08:33.578
I'll make the arrangements.

08:36.115 --> 08:38.350
Man:
<i>How long has russell stillman</i>

08:38.352 --> 08:40.385
Been your c.I.?
Two years.
He's the one

08:40.387 --> 08:43.321
Who got me into the citizens'
army in the first place.

08:43.323 --> 08:45.857
How do you know they're not
using him to set a trap?
I don't.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.559
But that's a chance
we've got to take.

08:47.561 --> 08:50.862
Woman: Here's the status
on the bellevue case.

08:50.864 --> 08:53.365
What's he doing here?

08:53.367 --> 08:54.866
Lincoln dittmann's
still in play.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.068
The founding father wants
to meet dittmann

08:57.070 --> 08:59.004
Tomorrow
in chicago.
Sir...

08:59.006 --> 09:00.805
Ellroy streeter has already sent
a plane ticket

09:00.807 --> 09:02.140
And a rental car key

09:02.142 --> 09:03.975
To lincoln's
arizona p.O. Box.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.343
He wants lincoln
to meet him

09:05.345 --> 09:08.547
At a strip club outside o'hare
tomorrow afternoon.

09:08.549 --> 09:11.049
Sir, that mess
in virginia happened

09:11.051 --> 09:12.884
Because martin refused
to loop us in.

09:12.886 --> 09:15.687
Nothing from you
in six months,

09:15.689 --> 09:17.188
Not a word.

09:17.190 --> 09:19.391
Then I get a call that you
crash an atf weapons bust,

09:19.393 --> 09:20.492
And I'm still

09:20.494 --> 09:22.060
Cleaning up
after you.
The last time

09:22.062 --> 09:23.895
I looped you in, one
of your people blew my cover.

09:23.897 --> 09:24.896
So...

09:24.898 --> 09:25.864
Forgive me
if I didn't

09:25.866 --> 09:27.399
Send you a memo.
Martin,

09:27.401 --> 09:28.900
Can you give us a moment,
please?

09:33.406 --> 09:35.473
Excuse me.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.613
I have tried running him

09:41.615 --> 09:43.748
For two years.
It doesn't work.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.417
You're acting like we got
a choice in this.

09:45.419 --> 09:47.586
He's got some kind of
personality disorder.

09:47.588 --> 09:48.920
Three out of four shrinks
on the committee

09:48.922 --> 09:50.255
Found him unfit for duty.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.424
What did the fourth shrink say?

09:53.626 --> 09:55.627
"that he's the most
naturally gifted

09:55.629 --> 09:57.629
"deep cover operative
that we've got

09:57.631 --> 10:00.265
And maybe the best
that we've ever had."

10:00.267 --> 10:04.069
Crystal, we're talking about
an imminent attack on u.S. Soil.

10:04.071 --> 10:06.104
Now, I know we're taking a risk
in reactivating him,

10:06.106 --> 10:09.608
But I'm more concerned
about the risk if we don't.

10:11.277 --> 10:13.745
(sighs)

10:13.747 --> 10:16.114
You need to debrief
my group.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.450
Before you do, just wipe
that smirk off your face.

10:18.452 --> 10:19.951
Just trying
to be civil.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.453
Do not patronize me.

10:21.455 --> 10:23.755
How long do you plan
on being pissed off at me?

10:23.757 --> 10:25.423
I run field ops.

10:25.425 --> 10:28.593
One of my people goes off
the grid, it makes me look bad.

10:28.595 --> 10:30.161
I didn't mean
to undermine your authority.

10:30.163 --> 10:32.864
What did you think would happen
when you went awol?

10:34.834 --> 10:36.468
I'm sorry.

10:38.904 --> 10:41.172
I'm also curious.

10:42.274 --> 10:44.876
That the only reason
you're mad at me?

10:47.947 --> 10:49.948
Don't flatter
yourself, martin.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.816
We were consenting
adults.

10:51.818 --> 10:55.120
We made a mistake.

10:55.122 --> 10:57.455
Happens every day.

10:57.457 --> 10:59.624
(distorted voice):
<i>Today...</i>

10:59.626 --> 11:02.761
True patriots fought back
against the so-called

11:02.763 --> 11:06.164
President, who is a puppet
for international bankers...

11:06.166 --> 11:07.799
(beep)
we don't even know who he is,

11:07.801 --> 11:09.367
Except that he calls himself
the founding father.

11:09.369 --> 11:11.670
He's the most dangerous domestic
terrorist in the country.

11:11.672 --> 11:13.004
And now he's gonna
try to top himself.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.006
Except that we're no closer
to finding him now

11:15.008 --> 11:16.341
Than we were three years ago.

11:16.343 --> 11:17.676
Well, it sounds
like odum got close.

11:17.678 --> 11:19.010
The guy's a rock star.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.679
Sure, odum was good.
But he should've been

11:20.681 --> 11:22.313
Put out to pasture
a long time ago.

11:22.315 --> 11:24.549
And I'm not the only
one who thinks so.

11:27.720 --> 11:29.187
Don't let me stop you, buchanan.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.156
I'm done.

11:31.158 --> 11:32.490
Martin, this

11:32.492 --> 11:34.659
Is maggie harris. She
joined the team last month

11:34.661 --> 11:36.528
To help out bobby with
analytics and field support.

11:36.530 --> 11:37.696
Hi, maggie.

11:37.698 --> 11:39.330
We actually have
something in common.

11:39.332 --> 11:41.399
I'm an air force
brat, too.

11:41.401 --> 11:43.501
Oh.
Only my father was
never stationed

11:43.503 --> 11:46.237
Overseas, so I didn't get a
cool accent out of the deal.

11:46.239 --> 11:48.239
(soft laugh)
lots to cover,

11:48.241 --> 11:50.041
Let's get started.

11:50.043 --> 11:52.744
Russell stillman,
former member

11:52.746 --> 11:55.547
Of the aryan brotherhood,
until he found god.

11:55.549 --> 11:58.083
Became the best asset
I've ever recruited.

11:58.085 --> 12:02.487
Ellroy streeter. The founding
father's top lieutenant.

12:02.489 --> 12:05.256
Tossed by the 82nd airborne for
striking his superior officer.

12:05.258 --> 12:06.658
If you're meeting
streeter tomorrow,

12:06.660 --> 12:08.593
We don't have a lot of time
to work out tac support.

12:08.595 --> 12:11.529
I'll make sure the follow team
gets to you within two minutes.
Make it five.

12:11.531 --> 12:13.665
Two minutes is standard.
Streeter knows
countersurveillance.

12:13.667 --> 12:14.766
Two minutes is too close.

12:14.768 --> 12:16.401
I'm down with the whole
respect-your-enemy

12:16.403 --> 12:18.036
Drill, but aren't you
giving these guys

12:18.038 --> 12:20.438
Too much credit?
Martin knows these guys
better than any of us,

12:20.440 --> 12:23.041
Plus he's the one
that's inside. It's his call.

12:23.043 --> 12:24.876
Fine. Five minutes.
Before they

12:24.878 --> 12:26.911
Activate dittmann, they're
gonna dig deeper into his

12:26.913 --> 12:27.946
Background.
Yeah, we need
to build up

12:27.948 --> 12:29.581
His history.
It's already

12:29.583 --> 12:31.449
Built. In here.

12:31.451 --> 12:32.917
Then start sharing,

12:32.919 --> 12:35.120
Because you're not
flying solo anymore.

12:41.127 --> 12:43.928
Lincoln was
a demolitions engineer for a

12:43.930 --> 12:46.765
<i>Construction company</i>
<i>in arizona.</i>
<i>Come on, set those charges.</i>

12:46.767 --> 12:48.600
He was good at his job.

12:48.602 --> 12:51.770
But his job took him away
from home so much that

12:51.772 --> 12:53.238
His wife...

12:53.240 --> 12:55.406
<i>Finally left him.</i>

12:55.408 --> 12:57.976
He tried getting her
to take him back.

12:57.978 --> 13:00.111
But it was too late.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.147
So he lost his wife.

13:02.149 --> 13:04.616
<i>Then the recession hit</i>

13:04.618 --> 13:05.950
And he lost his job.

13:05.952 --> 13:07.619
He took it hard.

13:07.621 --> 13:09.487
Couldn't get back
on his feet.

13:09.489 --> 13:11.156
Got upside-down
on his mortgage,

13:11.158 --> 13:13.124
Buried in debt.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.126
Children?
A daughter.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.128
<i>Ellie-may.</i>

13:17.130 --> 13:19.798
Oh, and ellie-may
has special needs.
What in the hell are you

13:19.800 --> 13:21.332
Talking about?
Ellie, dinner's ready, honey.

13:21.334 --> 13:24.636
Lincoln is socially awkward,

13:24.638 --> 13:26.838
Highly insecure.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.973
<i>He's got a persecution complex</i>

13:28.975 --> 13:30.942
And a... Stutter.

13:30.944 --> 13:31.943
If he's that angry,

13:31.945 --> 13:33.077
There should be a record.

13:33.079 --> 13:34.646
I'm building up his e-mails,
and I'll post

13:34.648 --> 13:36.047
Backdated comments
in chat rooms.

13:37.183 --> 13:39.984
As his savings dried up,

13:39.986 --> 13:41.319
His writing

13:41.321 --> 13:44.022
<i>Grew more strident.</i>

13:44.024 --> 13:46.024
More extreme.

13:46.026 --> 13:47.859
I'm giving him a credit
history that shows him

13:47.861 --> 13:49.494
Falling behind
on bills,

13:49.496 --> 13:51.062
Getting deeper
into debt.

13:53.632 --> 13:57.302
It's not fair.

13:57.304 --> 13:59.671
I did everything right.

13:59.673 --> 14:02.473
Learned
a trade,

14:02.475 --> 14:04.542
Worked hard.

14:05.978 --> 14:07.679
(american accent):
<i>I deserve...</i>

14:07.681 --> 14:09.747
B-better...

14:19.558 --> 14:20.692
(british accent):
What?

14:20.694 --> 14:23.127
You stuttered

14:23.129 --> 14:25.163
And your accent changed.

14:25.165 --> 14:27.432
You didn't notice?

14:31.036 --> 14:32.770
Go home.

14:34.206 --> 14:35.540
We'll backfill the legend.

14:38.677 --> 14:40.378
(line ringing)

14:40.380 --> 14:42.013
Aiden (on voice mail):
<i>Hey, this is aiden.</i>

14:42.015 --> 14:44.349
<i>You missed me.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

14:44.351 --> 14:46.017
Hi, aiden. It's dad.

14:46.019 --> 14:49.020
Um... Look,
I'm really, really sorry,

14:49.022 --> 14:50.388
But I've-I've got some bad news.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.390
Something's come up
and they need me back at work.

14:52.392 --> 14:55.059
Um... I don't think I'm gonna

14:55.061 --> 14:56.761
Be able to get together
with you tomorrow,

14:56.763 --> 14:59.631
But, listen,
I will make it up to you.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.067
Give me a call
when you get this.

15:03.069 --> 15:04.335
I love you, son.

15:23.222 --> 15:25.790
(grunts)

15:25.792 --> 15:27.225
What do you want?

15:27.227 --> 15:29.227
Huh?
Why are you following me?

15:29.229 --> 15:31.429
(grunts)

15:33.565 --> 15:35.733
I'm trying
to help you.

15:35.735 --> 15:37.635
What the hell
are you talking about?

15:37.637 --> 15:38.970
You don't know where
your life begins

15:38.972 --> 15:40.271
And your
legend ends.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.640
Who are you?

15:42.642 --> 15:43.808
I don't know.

15:43.810 --> 15:45.176
Who are you?

15:47.279 --> 15:48.479
Who do you think you are?

15:48.481 --> 15:51.115
(both grunting)

15:54.787 --> 15:57.789
You really think
you're martin odum?

15:59.792 --> 16:02.794
There is no
martin odum.

16:02.796 --> 16:03.928
He's a legend.

16:03.930 --> 16:05.563
Everything about
him is fake.

16:05.565 --> 16:06.631
(door opens)

16:08.467 --> 16:10.635
Trust
no one.

16:10.637 --> 16:13.304
No one!

16:23.115 --> 16:25.083
(dance music playing)

16:26.685 --> 16:28.753
(loud knocking at door)

16:30.990 --> 16:32.056
(music shuts off)

16:35.995 --> 16:37.161
Trying to give yourself
a heart attack?

16:37.163 --> 16:39.163
Prevent one.

16:39.165 --> 16:40.498
My cholesterol sucks,

16:40.500 --> 16:42.300
And my doctor says
I need to do more cardio.

16:42.302 --> 16:44.369
I hate
the gym.

16:45.504 --> 16:47.271
Need a favor, bobby.

16:47.273 --> 16:48.940
Well, technically,
you outrank me,

16:48.942 --> 16:50.808
So you can just order me
to do that.

16:50.810 --> 16:53.544
This is
off book.

16:53.546 --> 16:55.013
Just between us.

16:55.015 --> 16:57.148
I'm hoping
you can

16:57.150 --> 16:59.017
Clean this up enough
to make an I.D.

16:59.019 --> 17:00.985
It's from a subway
security camera.

17:00.987 --> 17:02.553
What's this
about?

17:02.555 --> 17:03.654
Maybe nothing.

17:03.656 --> 17:04.856
Probably
nothing.

17:04.858 --> 17:05.857
But just keep it...

17:05.859 --> 17:07.525
Between us. Got it.

17:07.527 --> 17:08.693
Let me just
download it

17:08.695 --> 17:10.595
To my hard
drive and...

17:16.735 --> 17:18.703
Okay, stop
it there.

17:18.705 --> 17:21.406
I'll run it through
facial recognition

17:21.408 --> 17:22.707
And get back to you
when I have something.

17:22.709 --> 17:23.708
Thanks, bobby.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.777
Martin...

17:26.745 --> 17:28.046
I know you
don't think so,

17:28.048 --> 17:29.814
But it's a good thing,

17:29.816 --> 17:31.549
Letting us watch
your back tomorrow.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.051
We're gonna
stop these guys.

17:33.053 --> 17:34.118
Right?

17:35.521 --> 17:37.522
Don't worry,
bobby.

17:37.524 --> 17:39.590
We'll get 'em.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.060
Crystal:
<i>Your flight's in two hours.</i>

17:42.062 --> 17:43.227
We'll be an hour
behind you.

17:43.229 --> 17:44.395
The chicago
field office

17:44.397 --> 17:45.730
Is prepped for
your arrival.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.532
Streeter will
have eyes on it.

17:47.534 --> 17:48.900
I'm not going
anywhere near there.

17:48.902 --> 17:51.202
Just make sure
you stay in contact.

17:51.204 --> 17:52.904
Lincoln's debit card,
I.D., cell phone,

17:52.906 --> 17:54.572
Picture of
his daughter.

17:54.574 --> 17:55.907
Streeter sent
a plane ticket

17:55.909 --> 17:58.076
To dittmann's p.O.
Box in phoenix.

17:58.078 --> 17:59.343
Already
in there.

17:59.345 --> 18:00.578
Dittmann's
boarding pass

18:00.580 --> 18:02.513
And baggage
claim receipt.
I'm impressed.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.248
Well, hopefully the founding
father will be, too.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.783
Omnidirectional mic

18:05.785 --> 18:07.785
With a built-in
gps pulse.

18:07.787 --> 18:08.920
Ah.

18:08.922 --> 18:10.088
A leash.

18:10.090 --> 18:12.023
A lifeline.

18:12.025 --> 18:13.091
I told you,

18:13.093 --> 18:15.259
Streeter has a serious hard-on

18:15.261 --> 18:16.594
About countersurveillance.

18:16.596 --> 18:17.929
Put it on,
keep it on.

18:17.931 --> 18:19.764
When you make contact
with the founding father,

18:19.766 --> 18:21.099
I'll send in
the tac team.

18:22.201 --> 18:24.135
We'll be five minutes
from the strip club.

18:25.537 --> 18:26.604
Yeah.

18:33.946 --> 18:37.448
Woman (over p.A.):
Flight 425 to savannah,

18:37.450 --> 18:38.850
Final boarding.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.095
(chuckles)

18:51.097 --> 18:52.997
(american accent):
Guys...

18:52.999 --> 18:54.665
-You guys.
-(knocking at door)

18:54.667 --> 18:55.800
Man:
Hey, buddy, hurry up.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.869
I got a plane to catch!

18:59.771 --> 19:01.839
I'll be... Right out.

19:13.819 --> 19:14.819
Martin:
Streeter and rand

19:14.821 --> 19:16.787
Are approaching now.

19:16.789 --> 19:17.889
Copy that.
We got eyes on you.

19:23.595 --> 19:26.197
Martin:
Hey! (laughs)

19:26.199 --> 19:29.834
That was crazy
back in v-virginia.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.102
Give rand
the car keys.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.006
(martin chuckling)

19:35.008 --> 19:36.841
Martin:
The founding father?

19:36.843 --> 19:38.176
He's really gonna meet us here?

19:38.178 --> 19:40.511
Streeter:
Stop asking
so many damn questions.

19:40.513 --> 19:41.612
Excuse me.

19:41.614 --> 19:42.947
What is it?
I don't know if this

19:42.949 --> 19:44.982
Is a problem, but just in case
it's a problem...

19:44.984 --> 19:46.050
Russell stillman's supposed
to check in

19:46.052 --> 19:47.151
With me every hour, right?

19:47.153 --> 19:48.019
Yeah.

19:48.021 --> 19:50.087
Five minutes late.

19:51.690 --> 19:53.157
Crystal, we may have

19:53.159 --> 19:54.692
A situation here.

19:54.694 --> 19:57.195
Stillman hasn't checked in.

19:57.197 --> 19:58.996
Check his motel room.
Be discreet.

19:58.998 --> 20:00.531
If he's not there,

20:00.533 --> 20:02.200
Find him.

20:03.669 --> 20:05.703
Man:
<i>Tell me again...</i>

20:05.705 --> 20:07.772
You believe in
the cause, russell?

20:09.708 --> 20:11.876
You're the
founding father.

20:11.878 --> 20:14.412
I believe
in you,

20:14.414 --> 20:16.080
And you
gotta know...

20:16.082 --> 20:18.382
I'm not a traitor.

20:19.918 --> 20:22.119
Neither is lincoln.

20:24.556 --> 20:27.658
Data can be planted...

20:27.660 --> 20:29.594
Records manipulated.

20:30.829 --> 20:32.663
People...

20:32.665 --> 20:35.733
People always
tell the truth

20:35.735 --> 20:38.102
In the end.

20:38.104 --> 20:39.937
(electricity buzzing)

20:39.939 --> 20:41.372
Russell:
No.

20:41.374 --> 20:42.740
No.
(screams)

20:42.742 --> 20:44.342
Thanks.

20:44.344 --> 20:46.544
Our people checked
stillman's motel room,

20:46.546 --> 20:47.945
And there's evidence
of a struggle.

20:47.947 --> 20:49.614
Okay, if they break stillman,
martin's dead.

20:49.616 --> 20:51.616
Isn't there a way
we can pull him out?

20:51.618 --> 20:53.451
No. We'll lose our only chance
of stopping this attack.

20:53.453 --> 20:55.419
He has to know that
he may have been compromised.

20:55.421 --> 20:57.855
He's already under, maggie.
There's no way to make contact.

20:59.124 --> 21:00.891
Not necessarily.

21:00.893 --> 21:02.059
Hey. Give me the keys.

21:02.061 --> 21:03.127
Buchanan:
Crystal, what are you doing?

21:04.963 --> 21:06.764
Man:
<i>Next up we've got</i>

21:06.766 --> 21:09.934
Lovely linda on the main stage.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.936
Hey...

21:11.938 --> 21:13.137
(gasps)

21:13.139 --> 21:16.774
â™ª

21:16.776 --> 21:18.809
Is he supposed
to c-call?

21:18.811 --> 21:21.379
Just sit back and
enjoy the view.

21:22.314 --> 21:24.649
Hey, boys.

21:24.651 --> 21:27.318
Which one of you wants
to help the economy

21:27.320 --> 21:29.620
With a private dance?

21:29.622 --> 21:31.656
(giggles)

21:31.658 --> 21:33.491
I'm star.

21:33.493 --> 21:35.993
What's your name, sweetie?

21:35.995 --> 21:37.295
His name's lincoln.

21:37.297 --> 21:38.663
Oh.

21:38.665 --> 21:40.731
Well, lincoln here--

21:40.733 --> 21:42.833
He looks like
he could use

21:42.835 --> 21:44.402
A little tlc. (laughs)

21:44.404 --> 21:46.070
What the hell's she doing?

21:46.072 --> 21:47.838
Tlc-- tatas,

21:47.840 --> 21:49.540
Legs and, uh...
Park the mouth, mehta.

21:51.076 --> 21:52.677
Don't you worry,
sweetheart.

21:52.679 --> 21:54.145
You just watch.

21:54.147 --> 21:55.680
Let me do the work.

21:55.682 --> 21:58.015
Don't insult the
lady, lincoln.

21:58.017 --> 22:00.151
(crystal giggles)

22:00.153 --> 22:03.354
One song. Change your life.

22:04.923 --> 22:07.191
Go get her.

22:11.029 --> 22:12.797
(giggles)

22:12.799 --> 22:14.532
I had to talk to you.

22:14.534 --> 22:18.703
Careful. Stay in character.
Camera.

22:18.705 --> 22:24.542
â™ª tell that there's
the pedigree â™ª

22:24.544 --> 22:27.511
â™ª experience is another one
meant for me â™ª

22:27.513 --> 22:29.714
â™ª but tell me now

22:29.716 --> 22:31.882
â™ª <i>tell me now</i> â™ª
â™ª and show me how

22:31.884 --> 22:33.484
â™ª show me how

22:33.486 --> 22:36.520
â™ª to understand
â™ª <i>understand...</i> â™ª

22:36.522 --> 22:38.222
Did it ever occur to you

22:38.224 --> 22:40.291
That crystal is
a cool stripper's name?

22:40.293 --> 22:42.893
I'll be sure to tell
my mother that you said so.

22:42.895 --> 22:45.162
Russell stillman never
checked in with maggie.

22:45.164 --> 22:46.464
We have to assume

22:46.466 --> 22:48.866
That the founding
father has him.

22:48.868 --> 22:50.735
Got to pull you
out of this.

22:50.737 --> 22:53.204
Russell wouldn't rat me out.

22:53.206 --> 22:55.206
Oh.

22:55.208 --> 22:58.876
What makes you so sure?

22:58.878 --> 23:02.079
Three years ago,

23:02.081 --> 23:04.648
The aryan brotherhood ordered
a hit on him over a meth deal.

23:04.650 --> 23:06.717
I ran interference.

23:08.920 --> 23:11.422
Are you willing
to bet your life on that?

23:11.424 --> 23:14.325
I already have.

23:14.327 --> 23:16.460
(phone chimes)

23:20.332 --> 23:22.433
You'd better go.

23:22.435 --> 23:24.335
The camera.

23:24.337 --> 23:27.671
There? Oh, it's just
a smoke detector.

23:29.775 --> 23:31.242
(sighs)

23:31.244 --> 23:33.444
(laughs)

23:33.446 --> 23:35.179
Oh.

23:35.181 --> 23:36.447
Hey.

23:36.449 --> 23:37.782
Song's not over
yet, sport.

23:37.784 --> 23:40.518
(laughs)

23:40.520 --> 23:42.787
Let's go, lincoln.
We have a schedule.

23:42.789 --> 23:45.089
Okay.

23:45.091 --> 23:47.158
Sorry.
(groans)

23:54.966 --> 23:57.034
(static)
they made him.

23:57.769 --> 23:58.636
Legend's blown.

23:58.638 --> 23:59.603
How do you know?

23:59.605 --> 24:01.372
I read people. That's what I do.

24:01.374 --> 24:02.940
Move the follow team in now.

24:02.942 --> 24:04.642
Follow team's still five minutes
away, just like martin wanted.

24:04.644 --> 24:06.477
Tell them to get moving.

24:12.317 --> 24:14.385
Move it, dittmann.

24:16.321 --> 24:18.122
Hey. What are you doing?

24:18.124 --> 24:21.258
Founding father still has
some doubts about you, lincoln,

24:21.260 --> 24:24.128
And russell-- well, he didn't
live long enough to put them

24:24.130 --> 24:26.297
To rest.

24:26.299 --> 24:27.598
Our man's in trouble.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.166
Follow team,
what's your eta?

24:29.168 --> 24:30.534
We're still three
and a half minutes out.

24:31.770 --> 24:34.472
On your knees, lincoln.

24:34.474 --> 24:36.874
(grunts)

24:39.010 --> 24:40.778
Crystal:
Hey, you owe me

24:40.780 --> 24:42.480
50 bucks!

24:42.482 --> 24:44.482
Shouldn't have
come out here, sweetheart.

24:44.484 --> 24:46.484
Crystal:
You want money?

24:46.486 --> 24:47.318
I got cash.

24:47.320 --> 24:48.819
(grunts)

24:52.324 --> 24:55.326
(laughing)
what's so damn funny?

24:55.328 --> 24:57.628
(laughing)

24:57.630 --> 25:00.664
You think that
I am afraid to die?

25:00.666 --> 25:03.167
I'm already d-dead.

25:03.169 --> 25:04.168
Don't you know?

25:04.170 --> 25:06.237
Know what?

25:08.173 --> 25:10.875
I have stage four c-c-cancer.

25:10.877 --> 25:13.344
I just...

25:13.346 --> 25:15.546
I just didn't want to die
before I made my m-mark.

25:15.548 --> 25:16.714
He's improvising. He's giving

25:16.716 --> 25:18.015
The follow team time
to get there.

25:18.017 --> 25:19.183
Buchanan:
Follow team's

25:19.185 --> 25:20.184
Still two minutes out.

25:20.186 --> 25:22.653
(line ringing)

25:22.655 --> 25:24.722
Streeter?

25:24.724 --> 25:26.524
Dittmann says
he's dying of cancer.

25:26.526 --> 25:28.692
Ask him where he was diagnosed.

25:28.694 --> 25:30.060
Where were you diagnosed?

25:30.062 --> 25:32.730
Arizona medical center.
Tucson.

25:32.732 --> 25:34.865
Talk to me, maggie.

25:34.867 --> 25:38.168
I'll give him, uh,
ewing's sarcoma, first

25:38.170 --> 25:39.570
Detected when he complained

25:39.572 --> 25:41.205
Of pain in his right knee.
Awesome.

25:41.207 --> 25:43.040
(beeps)
chemo and radiation
non-responsive

25:43.042 --> 25:44.742
After three rounds
of doxorubicin,

25:44.744 --> 25:46.343
And another three
of methotrexate?

25:46.345 --> 25:47.411
Beautiful.

25:47.413 --> 25:48.245
Doctor's name?

25:48.247 --> 25:49.213
Who was your doctor?

25:49.215 --> 25:51.415
Claude metzger.

25:52.417 --> 25:56.053
(keyboard keys click,
beep, trilling)

25:57.389 --> 25:59.924
(trilling, beep)

25:59.926 --> 26:02.993
No records
for a lincoln dittmann

26:02.995 --> 26:04.061
At that hospital.

26:04.063 --> 26:05.896
No records.
You're lying.

26:05.898 --> 26:07.765
That's impossible.
I uploaded everything.

26:07.767 --> 26:09.567
I don't understand.
Follow team, what's your eta?

26:09.569 --> 26:10.734
60 seconds.

26:10.736 --> 26:12.870
(crystal gasps)

26:12.872 --> 26:13.737
Are you sure

26:13.739 --> 26:15.940
He's spelling it right?

26:15.942 --> 26:18.275
Two ns! Dittmann
has two ns!

26:22.247 --> 26:23.881
(computer trilling)

26:23.883 --> 26:25.082
(beeping)

26:25.084 --> 26:28.252
Stand down, streeter.

26:28.254 --> 26:30.154
He's good.

26:31.723 --> 26:33.023
(phone beeps off)

26:33.025 --> 26:34.525
Lucky day, lincoln.

26:34.527 --> 26:36.694
You checked out.
(crystal sighs)

26:36.696 --> 26:38.062
What about her?
(crystal panting)

26:38.064 --> 26:40.931
Martin:
Let her go.

26:40.933 --> 26:42.399
She doesn't know anything.

26:42.401 --> 26:43.701
We don't need any more

26:43.703 --> 26:47.104
C-c-complications.
Please.

26:47.106 --> 26:49.473
Please.

26:49.475 --> 26:51.108
I've been around long enough
to keep my mouth shut.

26:51.110 --> 26:53.444
I'm like a priest, I swear.

26:54.946 --> 26:56.947
I swear.
You say anything

26:56.949 --> 26:59.116
To anyone, I'll find you.

26:59.118 --> 27:00.384
Get lost.

27:00.386 --> 27:02.453
(gasps)

27:03.622 --> 27:06.123
Let's go.

27:06.125 --> 27:08.792
Follow team, drive past target.

27:08.794 --> 27:10.227
I say again, do not engage.

27:10.229 --> 27:12.096
Man:
Roger that. Driving by target.

27:12.098 --> 27:13.397
Buchanan:
Crystal, what's your status?

27:13.399 --> 27:15.399
I'm clear.

27:15.401 --> 27:17.568
Use cash, lay low.

27:17.570 --> 27:18.736
We'll contact you.

27:18.738 --> 27:19.803
So when is this happening?

27:19.805 --> 27:21.205
Tonight.

27:22.140 --> 27:24.642
You hear that?

27:24.644 --> 27:26.777
Call gates.

27:26.779 --> 27:29.647
Gates:
Financial ministers from the g7

27:29.649 --> 27:31.749
Will be
at the imf summit tonight.

27:31.751 --> 27:35.653
There's a whole media event
planned at the willis tower

27:35.655 --> 27:38.322
To announce the economic
cooperation agreement.

27:38.324 --> 27:41.659
If that gets hit, that could
turn the recession into

27:41.661 --> 27:43.594
A full-blown
depression.
As far as

27:43.596 --> 27:46.163
High-value targets go,
it doesn't get any better.

27:46.165 --> 27:47.931
It's not just a symbolic target.

27:47.933 --> 27:50.601
10,000 people work there.

27:50.603 --> 27:52.770
Buchanan:
We'll work up
a threat assessment

27:52.772 --> 27:54.805
And alert all relevant
law enforcement agencies.

27:54.807 --> 27:56.674
Gates:
I want everyone here

27:56.676 --> 27:59.610
On standby for when streeter
calls dittmann.

27:59.612 --> 28:02.046
Everyone.

28:04.983 --> 28:07.051
(car engine idling outside)

28:15.126 --> 28:17.961
(gun clicks)

28:17.963 --> 28:19.963
(car engine shuts off)

28:19.965 --> 28:22.066
(car door opens)

28:22.068 --> 28:23.634
(car door closes)

28:23.636 --> 28:25.703
(knocking)

28:32.877 --> 28:34.678
You took a risk coming here.

28:34.680 --> 28:36.547
Oh, we did a sweep.
They're not watching the motel.

28:36.549 --> 28:38.215
Well, what's going on?

28:38.217 --> 28:41.218
I wanted to tell you
in person.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.887
Chicago pd found russell's body
in a vacant lot near the river.

28:43.889 --> 28:46.457
It looks like
he was tortured.

28:52.197 --> 28:53.964
(sighs)

28:57.736 --> 29:00.671
You were right
about him holding out.

29:00.673 --> 29:02.206
Not breaking.

29:02.208 --> 29:05.676
Oh, we should do something
for his family.

29:05.678 --> 29:08.779
Um... He mentioned
a sister in kentucky.

29:08.781 --> 29:10.013
Lexington, I think.

29:10.015 --> 29:11.281
I don't think
that's appropriate, martin.

29:11.283 --> 29:12.583
But he was my c.I.

29:12.585 --> 29:14.084
He risked his life for me.

29:14.086 --> 29:16.754
He was also a card-carrying
member of the aryan brotherhood.

29:16.756 --> 29:18.355
Yeah, well, people
change, crystal.

29:18.357 --> 29:20.524
He changed.

29:20.526 --> 29:23.961
Became someone else.

29:26.397 --> 29:30.033
You saved the operation today.

29:30.035 --> 29:32.770
All right, it's not
how I would've done it, but...

29:32.772 --> 29:35.372
You kept your composure,

29:35.374 --> 29:37.941
You preserved your cover.

29:37.943 --> 29:40.010
You know, we have a chance
of actually stopping this thing.

29:41.613 --> 29:43.881
I-I-it was...

29:43.883 --> 29:45.415
Impressive.

29:45.417 --> 29:47.451
Wow.

29:47.453 --> 29:49.453
I bet that wasn't
easy for you to say.

29:49.455 --> 29:51.388
You have no idea.

29:52.557 --> 29:54.958
(cell phone ringing)

29:54.960 --> 29:56.894
I have to take this.

30:03.601 --> 30:05.903
(sighs)

30:08.439 --> 30:10.607
Hello, th-th-this is lincoln.

30:10.609 --> 30:13.143
No, I'm alone.

30:13.145 --> 30:14.678
Yeah, I...

30:14.680 --> 30:17.514
I can g-g-get there.

30:17.516 --> 30:19.249
(clicks tongue)

30:19.251 --> 30:21.318
You-you got it.

30:24.589 --> 30:26.924
(places phone on the desk)

30:26.926 --> 30:29.993
I meet the founding father
tonight.

30:35.133 --> 30:37.501
As we reported earlier,
the treasury secretary has been

30:37.503 --> 30:40.838
In negotiations all day
with finance ministers

30:40.840 --> 30:42.206
From the g7 member nations

30:42.208 --> 30:44.441
And the heads of major banks
from around the world.

30:44.443 --> 30:46.944
This imf summit hosted by
the u.S. Treasury secretary...

30:46.946 --> 30:48.812
Hey!

30:48.814 --> 30:50.380
Get in.

31:00.959 --> 31:01.959
Alpha team?

31:01.961 --> 31:03.694
They're moving east
on van buren.

31:03.696 --> 31:05.229
Copy that.

31:05.231 --> 31:06.430
Keeping a two-block buffer.

31:07.799 --> 31:10.167
Martin:
Don't ever get divorced.

31:10.169 --> 31:12.169
Streeter:
I'll make a note of that.

31:12.171 --> 31:13.871
Martin:
My wife was a good woman.

31:13.873 --> 31:16.306
But I treated her like dirt.

31:16.308 --> 31:19.543
Everything that went bad
was all my f-f-f...

31:19.545 --> 31:21.211
Streeter:
All your fault-- got it.
You can stop talking now.

31:21.213 --> 31:23.146
He's talking about
himself, isn't he?

31:24.849 --> 31:28.485
First rule of undercover--

31:28.487 --> 31:31.388
Make the lie as close
as possible to the truth.

31:34.659 --> 31:35.692
Okay.

31:35.694 --> 31:36.693
They're turning into

31:36.695 --> 31:38.228
An alleyway between adams

31:38.230 --> 31:40.063
And jackson. The only
place that's listed here

31:40.065 --> 31:42.432
Is an auto repair shop.

32:02.754 --> 32:04.821
All set.

32:08.026 --> 32:09.960
Wow. C4.

32:09.962 --> 32:13.463
Guess how much.

32:13.465 --> 32:14.765
500 pounds?

32:14.767 --> 32:16.300
Six.

32:16.302 --> 32:18.602
"all talk, no action," huh?

32:18.604 --> 32:19.803
(quiet laugh)

32:19.805 --> 32:21.538
Here you go, officer...

32:21.540 --> 32:22.773
"barczak."

32:27.445 --> 32:30.814
I see t-two hats.

32:30.816 --> 32:32.783
Does that mean
I'm going in with you?

32:32.785 --> 32:34.751
You'll be going in with me.

32:34.753 --> 32:38.288
Sorry about russell, but we
couldn't take any chances.

32:39.924 --> 32:42.960
Sometimes a good soldier has
to fall for a good cause.

32:53.438 --> 32:55.605
Crystal: Alpha and delta team
standing by.

32:55.607 --> 32:57.441
Waiting to confirm target.

32:57.443 --> 33:00.277
The police staging
area is right here,

33:00.279 --> 33:04.147
Next to where the bankers and
their puppets are selling out

33:04.149 --> 33:07.351
This country.

33:07.353 --> 33:09.486
You'll be firing the first shot
of the next american revolution.

33:09.488 --> 33:10.988
You ready to make history?

33:10.990 --> 33:12.789
Yes, sir.

33:12.791 --> 33:14.858
That's what I signed up for.

33:14.860 --> 33:18.829
Except I di-didn't see
a detonator in the car.

33:18.831 --> 33:21.665
I've got it.

33:21.667 --> 33:25.002
Once we're inside the perimeter,

33:25.004 --> 33:26.703
You'll let me out.

33:26.705 --> 33:30.307
And as soon as you
get close enough...

33:30.309 --> 33:32.943
So... So you're not

33:32.945 --> 33:34.378
Going in with me.

33:38.516 --> 33:40.083
Listen to me.

33:42.153 --> 33:45.722
We've all got our
parts to play, right?

33:45.724 --> 33:48.091
I'm your founding father.

33:49.193 --> 33:52.662
And I will be your witness.

33:52.664 --> 33:54.865
So I can tell the people

33:54.867 --> 33:58.201
Who lincoln dittmann really was.

33:58.203 --> 33:59.636
Yes, sir.

33:59.638 --> 34:00.670
Right?

34:00.672 --> 34:01.671
Yes, sir.

34:01.673 --> 34:03.140
Okay.

34:03.142 --> 34:04.841
Get your uniform on.

34:04.843 --> 34:06.676
It's time.

34:06.678 --> 34:07.844
Alpha, delta,

34:07.846 --> 34:09.513
Target is confirmed.

34:09.515 --> 34:11.048
Target confirmed.

34:11.050 --> 34:12.549
Stand by to breach on my count.

34:13.384 --> 34:15.052
(indistinct radio transmission)

34:15.054 --> 34:16.219
Sir?

34:16.221 --> 34:19.222
I'm picking up
radio communication

34:19.224 --> 34:21.391
Just outside this building.

34:21.393 --> 34:23.026
Let me hear it.

34:23.028 --> 34:26.263
Crystal:
Repeat, maintain
fire discipline.

34:26.265 --> 34:27.597
We have a man inside.

34:27.599 --> 34:29.633
Repeat-- man inside.

34:34.105 --> 34:37.074
(men grunting)

34:42.547 --> 34:44.815
Agent: Fbi!
Agent 2: Fbi! Drop your weapons!

34:45.583 --> 34:47.017
Fbi! Empty your hands!

34:48.119 --> 34:49.553
Show me your hands!
Show me your hands!

34:49.555 --> 34:51.254
Stay back!

34:51.256 --> 34:52.456
Or I'll take
this whole place down!

34:52.458 --> 34:53.757
Drop it!
It's a dead man's switch!

34:53.759 --> 34:56.226
You shoot me,
my finger goes off the trigger

34:56.228 --> 34:58.295
And everyone dies.

34:59.764 --> 35:01.898
You.

35:01.900 --> 35:03.900
Get behind the wheel.

35:03.902 --> 35:05.435
We're driving out
of here together.

35:05.437 --> 35:06.837
No. You won't.

35:08.973 --> 35:10.607
You stand down

35:10.609 --> 35:12.375
Or I swear I'll take us all out.

35:12.377 --> 35:13.743
Right here, right now!

35:13.745 --> 35:15.145
I don't think so.

35:16.114 --> 35:17.147
If you were gonna do it,

35:17.149 --> 35:18.448
You would've done it already.

35:18.450 --> 35:20.617
Streeter:
What are you waiting for?

35:20.619 --> 35:21.785
Do it!

35:21.787 --> 35:23.286
You heard him.

35:24.122 --> 35:25.922
Go ahead.

35:25.924 --> 35:27.958
Do it.

35:32.630 --> 35:33.797
Do it!

35:35.466 --> 35:37.634
That's right.

35:37.636 --> 35:40.437
You wanted me to do it.

35:40.439 --> 35:43.206
So you could watch. Yeah?

35:49.680 --> 35:51.214
(grunts)

35:55.987 --> 35:58.188
Bomb's clear!

35:58.190 --> 35:59.856
All right, we're clear.
Move in.

35:59.858 --> 36:01.525
(indistinct radio transmission)

36:01.527 --> 36:03.693
Where are you going?

36:03.695 --> 36:04.995
Martin!

36:04.997 --> 36:07.063
(panting)

36:09.500 --> 36:11.668
Man:
<i>You don't know</i>
<i>where your life begins</i>

36:11.670 --> 36:13.336
<i>And your legend ends.</i>

36:13.338 --> 36:14.571
There is no martin odum!

36:27.018 --> 36:29.519
(computer beeping)

36:34.058 --> 36:36.226
Bring it on, bitch.

36:44.402 --> 36:45.936
(muffled grunting)

36:58.349 --> 37:01.251
(door closes)

37:03.521 --> 37:06.389
I'm really sorry about your c.I.

37:06.391 --> 37:08.458
Thanks.

37:09.894 --> 37:13.263
Thanks for backing me up.

37:13.265 --> 37:15.232
I'm not the best team player.

37:15.234 --> 37:18.435
I know that about myself.

37:18.437 --> 37:21.738
That's what bobby said.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.173
Not in a bad way.
(laughs)

37:23.175 --> 37:24.241
(chuckles)

37:24.243 --> 37:26.409
Where is bobby?

37:26.411 --> 37:27.911
I don't know.

37:27.913 --> 37:29.980
I haven't seen him.

37:34.719 --> 37:36.052
(door opens)

37:36.054 --> 37:37.053
(line ringing)

37:37.055 --> 37:38.421
This is bobby.

37:38.423 --> 37:39.956
Can't pick up
the phone right now,

37:39.958 --> 37:42.259
So leave a message
and don't be boring.

37:42.261 --> 37:43.793
(line beeps)

37:43.795 --> 37:45.228
(knocking)
martin: Bobby?

37:45.230 --> 37:47.297
(loud dance music playing)

37:50.201 --> 37:52.269
Bobby?

37:56.807 --> 37:58.875
(door closes)

38:02.913 --> 38:04.981
Bobby.

38:26.103 --> 38:28.405
â™ª

38:41.319 --> 38:43.987
Man:
<i>You really think</i>
<i>you're martin odum?</i>

38:43.989 --> 38:45.021
There is no martin odum!

38:45.023 --> 38:47.490
Martin:
<i>I need a favor, bobby.</i>

38:47.492 --> 38:48.992
<i>I'm hoping you can</i>
<i>clean this up enough</i>

38:48.994 --> 38:50.827
<i>To make an I.D.</i>

38:50.829 --> 38:51.995
Trust no one!

38:52.863 --> 38:54.931
(shudders)

39:02.340 --> 39:04.307
Hello.

39:04.309 --> 39:05.375
Are you ready to listen?

39:05.377 --> 39:06.543
I've been ready to listen.

39:06.545 --> 39:07.677
Now I want some answers.

39:07.679 --> 39:08.845
What is this?

39:08.847 --> 39:10.380
My friend died trying
to find out

39:10.382 --> 39:12.549
Who you are.
I told you not to tell anyone.

39:12.551 --> 39:14.884
Look! I want to know
what the hell is going on!

39:14.886 --> 39:16.186
Listen to me.

39:16.188 --> 39:17.387
Meet me at union station.

39:17.389 --> 39:19.022
Platform six.

39:19.024 --> 39:20.323
I need to give you something.

39:20.325 --> 39:22.492
What?
Hurry. I'm being followed.

39:22.494 --> 39:23.693
They'll kill me
if they get the chance.

39:23.695 --> 39:24.861
Who will?
Hurry!

39:24.863 --> 39:26.363
Just get here!
Stay on the line.

39:26.365 --> 39:28.198
I want you to answer
some questions.

39:28.200 --> 39:30.200
(tires screech)

39:30.202 --> 39:32.736
Tell me what happened!

39:32.738 --> 39:34.237
You were never supposed
to remember.

39:34.239 --> 39:37.173
Remember what?

39:37.175 --> 39:38.375
(car horn drones)

39:38.377 --> 39:40.343
I got to get out of here.
Wait.

39:40.345 --> 39:42.545
I'm just pulling up now.

39:42.547 --> 39:44.614
(tires screech)

39:45.916 --> 39:47.684
Listen, I'm coming! All right?

39:47.686 --> 39:49.586
I'm here.
I don't see you.

39:49.588 --> 39:51.354
I'm almost on the platform.

39:51.356 --> 39:53.223
Just wait!

39:53.225 --> 39:55.558
Been waiting too long.

39:55.560 --> 39:56.693
They're probably watching.

39:56.695 --> 39:57.527
(grunts)

39:57.529 --> 39:59.129
Who's watching?!

40:03.567 --> 40:06.069
Are you there?

40:06.071 --> 40:08.805
Hey! Hey!

40:13.210 --> 40:14.778
They don't want you
to know the truth.

40:14.780 --> 40:17.080
They don't want you to know

40:17.082 --> 40:19.048
Who you are.

40:19.050 --> 40:20.216
Who doesn't?

40:20.218 --> 40:22.085
There's a book, left pocket.

40:22.087 --> 40:24.921
The answer's in there.

40:24.923 --> 40:26.222
I didn't find it in time.

40:26.224 --> 40:27.891
But you can.

40:27.893 --> 40:29.058
Tell me who you are.

40:29.060 --> 40:31.594
I don't know.

40:31.596 --> 40:33.163
Who am I?

40:34.799 --> 40:36.266
Who am I?!

40:37.435 --> 40:39.936
Woman:
911. Uh, there's an emergency.

40:39.938 --> 40:42.772
(continues indistinctly)

40:50.614 --> 40:52.115
(overlapping chatter)

40:52.117 --> 40:54.184
Man:
Hey, lady, call 911!
