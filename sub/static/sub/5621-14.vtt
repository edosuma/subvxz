your granddaughter.

<i>Only on Fox.</i>

00:19.020 --> 00:20.953
GRINDER: You're home late.

00:20.955 --> 00:23.122
Another date with that slut?

00:23.124 --> 00:24.823
Since when do you care
where I am?

00:24.825 --> 00:26.625
Hmm? Or who I'm with?

00:26.627 --> 00:28.127
She'll break your heart.

00:28.129 --> 00:29.962
You can bet your ass on that.

00:29.964 --> 00:32.631
LUKE: You are unbelievable.

00:32.633 --> 00:34.500
Yeah, Mom left, okay?
Deal with it.

00:34.502 --> 00:38.037
She's gone,
and she is never coming back.

00:38.039 --> 00:41.140
Don't you ever
talk to me... (grunts)

00:41.142 --> 00:43.208
LUKE: She's my mom.
You have to stop this.

00:43.210 --> 00:44.977
Daddy, sit down.

00:44.979 --> 00:47.046
What happened to the guy
who wanted to settle down

00:47.048 --> 00:49.481
and spend more time with
his family, even if that meant

00:49.483 --> 00:51.350
logging in a few less hours
for the law?

00:51.352 --> 00:53.819
I can't!
People would go to jail!

00:53.821 --> 00:56.055
People would get
the death sentence!

00:56.057 --> 00:57.656
Is that what you want?!

00:57.658 --> 00:59.558
I just want my dad back.

00:59.560 --> 01:02.728
What if I can't be the dad
you need?

01:02.730 --> 01:05.164
LUKE: Then you can't.

01:05.166 --> 01:07.332
You don't have to
win everything.

01:07.334 --> 01:10.335
You don't have to be The Grinder
all the time.

01:10.337 --> 01:14.840
I never thought
that you would be teaching me.

01:14.842 --> 01:17.876
Well, maybe
what we don't realize is...

01:17.878 --> 01:19.978
we'd be teaching each other.

01:22.049 --> 01:23.682
So, what do you say
you put that bottle down

01:23.684 --> 01:25.084
and we go back inside?

01:25.086 --> 01:26.385
GRINDER: I'd like that.

01:26.387 --> 01:27.853
STEWART: So he has a son now?

01:27.855 --> 01:29.388
Since when?

01:29.390 --> 01:32.191
Since season four premiere,
"Grind-fathered."

01:32.193 --> 01:33.559
They gave me a son

01:33.561 --> 01:35.360
to ground my character.

01:35.362 --> 01:36.929
Wait.

01:36.931 --> 01:38.363
"Ground-fathered."

01:38.365 --> 01:40.099
Should that have been it?

01:40.101 --> 01:42.034
Possibly. I mean,
they're both so good.

01:42.036 --> 01:44.603
Definitely. Wait, I'm sorry.
So out of nowhere,

01:44.605 --> 01:47.206
he just has a teenage son?
Well, he'd been at war.

01:47.208 --> 01:49.208
Yes, Deb, he was off at war.
Oh, right.

01:49.210 --> 01:50.609
You know,
you need a lead character

01:50.611 --> 01:52.111
who is emotionally grounded,
you know?

01:52.113 --> 01:54.113
You need to know
that he feels things.

01:54.115 --> 01:56.582
Otherwise, you won't watch.

01:56.584 --> 01:58.417
Really? Because I just watch
for the courtroom stuff.

01:58.419 --> 02:00.219
No, that's why you think
you watch, but what makes

02:00.221 --> 02:02.254
the courtroom stuff land is
that you have a lead character

02:02.256 --> 02:04.456
who is emotionally grounded
and relatable.

02:04.458 --> 02:05.891
ETHAN: Did it work?
Did more people

02:05.893 --> 02:07.092
start watching? Not only

02:07.094 --> 02:09.054
did it work
but it saved the series.

02:09.930 --> 02:13.065
And we have the network
to thank for that.

02:13.067 --> 02:16.135
¶ ¶

02:18.639 --> 02:21.306
Bill Foosley of Foosley Motors
is looking for new counsel.

02:21.308 --> 02:22.441
He's a big fish.

02:22.443 --> 02:24.176
In a small pond.

02:25.279 --> 02:26.578
Sorry, I was, uh, trying

02:26.580 --> 02:27.946
to sound like Dean there and...
Right.

02:27.948 --> 02:29.581
Well, this is
a potential game-changer.

02:29.583 --> 02:30.649
Could increase
our billable hours

02:30.651 --> 02:31.950
by nearly 30%.

02:31.952 --> 02:33.752
(whistles)
But we have to land him first.

02:33.754 --> 02:35.954
Now, he's meeting
with all the top firms, so...

02:35.956 --> 02:37.823
So this is a street fight.
It's not a street fight,

02:37.825 --> 02:38.957
uh, at all.

02:38.959 --> 02:40.926
It's simply a businessman
being methodical

02:40.928 --> 02:42.494
in his search
for legal representation.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.329
And then it's a street fight.

02:44.331 --> 02:45.130
It's never a fight.

02:45.132 --> 02:46.431
We got to jam a 12-gauge

02:46.433 --> 02:49.935
right in their pistachio bags.
Whose?

02:49.937 --> 02:52.504
Uh, no. Stewart's just having
dinner with him tomorrow night,

02:52.506 --> 02:56.108
where there will be no need for
a shotgun to anyone's genitals.

02:56.110 --> 02:57.776
Foosley Motors.
I've seen those ads.

02:57.778 --> 03:00.279
They quiver with sound,
music, color.

03:00.281 --> 03:02.281
We're clearly dealing with
a man who employs pageantry

03:02.283 --> 03:04.616
and spectacle as a sales tool.

03:04.618 --> 03:07.019
Flash needs to be met...

03:07.021 --> 03:08.287
with flash. With flash.

03:08.289 --> 03:10.789
Yes, I was saying that, too.
I agree. Yes.

03:10.791 --> 03:12.191
Flash with flash.
Okay, that's... I'm gonna...

03:12.193 --> 03:14.126
That's a great thought, Dean.
I'm gonna... Flash with flash.

03:14.128 --> 03:15.460
I think I need to be
at this dinner.

03:15.462 --> 03:16.795
I'm thinking that's<i> not</i>
what should happen.

03:16.797 --> 03:17.963
I'm thinking that's
a huge mistake.

03:17.965 --> 03:19.131
I'm thinking that, too.

03:19.133 --> 03:20.032
Me, too.

03:20.034 --> 03:21.967
(clicks tongue) Mm.

03:21.969 --> 03:24.870
And then Coleman shouts at me

03:24.872 --> 03:27.139
about how I disregarded
his instructions.

03:27.141 --> 03:28.640
And it's like, "Coleman",

03:28.642 --> 03:30.642
"we've been through this
a hundred times.

03:30.644 --> 03:33.312
"You say the quarterly report
should include projections

03:33.314 --> 03:36.048
for international growth, but
Dandro does not want that."

03:36.050 --> 03:37.216
Right.
And it's like, "Yeah, Coleman",

03:37.218 --> 03:39.151
"sure, you're my supervisor,

03:39.153 --> 03:41.153
but Dandro owns the firm."

03:41.155 --> 03:42.187
Yeah. Yeah.

03:42.189 --> 03:43.522
Classic Coleman. I know, right?

03:43.524 --> 03:45.324
I'm just so sick of being stuck

03:45.326 --> 03:47.492
in the middle of these guys.

03:47.494 --> 03:49.995
Well, I think until one of 'em
leaves, you just have to suck it up.

03:49.997 --> 03:51.196
Suck it up? That
wasn't exactly Yeah.

03:51.198 --> 03:53.198
The<i> Rudy</i> moment
I was hoping for.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.200
Sorry, babe. I...

03:55.202 --> 03:57.669
I'm just...
I'm a little distracted.

03:57.671 --> 04:00.038
The Foosley account? Yeah. He's
gonna show up to dinner, Deb.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.840
Who, Foosley? Isn't that
who the dinner's with?

04:01.842 --> 04:03.408
Yeah, that's who the dinner's
with. I'm not...

04:03.410 --> 04:05.344
worried that Foosley's
gonna come to the dinner.

04:05.346 --> 04:07.079
I'm talking about Dean, guys.

04:07.081 --> 04:08.513
Oh. Oh, right. That was...
Come on. I don't want

04:08.515 --> 04:10.582
Dean to come to the dinner.
Yeah. No, I agree.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.751
Because he's impossible. I don't know.
I mean, have you talked

04:12.753 --> 04:14.353
to Jillian about it? You're
paying this therapist a ton

04:14.355 --> 04:17.022
of money. Can she help
with this or is it just on us?

04:17.024 --> 04:18.390
No. She agrees with me.

04:18.392 --> 04:20.058
I just... I can't
get through to him.

04:20.060 --> 04:22.060
So what if you have her talk
to him?

04:22.062 --> 04:24.863
Have Jillian talk to Dean.

04:24.865 --> 04:26.431
Yeah. Cut out the middleman.

04:26.433 --> 04:28.033
Can I do that? Why not?

04:28.035 --> 04:29.601
Why not? Right.

04:29.603 --> 04:32.037
It'll sound better
coming from her.

04:32.039 --> 04:32.704
Much.

04:32.706 --> 04:33.872
Much better.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.040
This is perfect.
This is gonna work.

04:35.042 --> 04:36.908
Guys, thank you! Good...

04:36.910 --> 04:39.144
good teamwork. I like it!

04:40.414 --> 04:44.049
Whoa. When did all this happen?

04:44.051 --> 04:46.551
Well, I'd been doing most of my
work in the conference room,

04:46.553 --> 04:48.387
and I figured a
cubicle isn't really,

04:48.389 --> 04:50.088
you know... Right.

04:50.090 --> 04:51.890
So why not take over
Yao's office

04:51.892 --> 04:54.226
and then move in all your
furniture from<i> The Grinder?</i> Yeah.

04:54.228 --> 04:56.295
Come in. Sit down. Can
I get you something?

04:56.297 --> 04:57.629
Fizzy water, diet soda?

04:57.631 --> 04:59.798
Uh, no, I'm-I'm good. (Chuckles)

04:59.800 --> 05:01.800
So what's up?
Uh, I kind of wanted to...

05:01.802 --> 05:03.802
to talk big picture with you.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.404
Oh, macro convo. Love it.

05:05.406 --> 05:09.474
Great. Uh, okay,
so you, uh, are here

05:09.476 --> 05:11.743
for the long haul.
I'm accepting that,

05:11.745 --> 05:13.979
and I'm-I'm... I'm embracing it.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.981
That's so sweet.
But I think for this situation

05:15.983 --> 05:18.083
to be sustainable,

05:18.085 --> 05:20.919
we might need
to make just a few,

05:20.921 --> 05:23.588
um... adjustments.

05:23.590 --> 05:25.257
Adjustments. Great.
Let's dive in.

05:25.259 --> 05:27.426
You want to go first
or should I?

05:27.428 --> 05:30.095
Oh, you have adjustments for me?
Yeah, but, you know, you go first.

05:30.097 --> 05:33.098
Fire away. Thank you. Um...

05:33.100 --> 05:35.267
Let's see. How do I...
how do I say this?

05:35.269 --> 05:37.269
Um, sometimes, Dean,

05:37.271 --> 05:39.438
it feels
like you have a tendency

05:39.440 --> 05:42.507
to bring the dramatics
from your TV show

05:42.509 --> 05:44.810
into the real world. Example.

05:44.812 --> 05:47.446
Sure.
Um, when you say stuff like,

05:47.448 --> 05:49.948
"The Grinder never settles."

05:49.950 --> 05:52.617
He doesn't. Ever. I know that
about him, and I love it.

05:52.619 --> 05:55.854
And that's great
for a TV character.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.456
Problem is, in real life,

05:57.458 --> 06:00.192
lawyers settle. A lot.

06:00.194 --> 06:02.327
Not if I have any say in it.

06:02.329 --> 06:03.962
Okay. Great example.
Another one.

06:03.964 --> 06:07.299
Great line for like
a-a hard-nosed TV lawyer,

06:07.301 --> 06:10.535
but does not have a place here.

06:12.339 --> 06:14.339
But what if it did?

06:14.341 --> 06:16.141
See, I don't even think
you know when you're doing it,

06:16.143 --> 06:19.044
and that is really
what concerns me the most.

06:19.046 --> 06:20.879
Stew, I have to say,
this whole thing

06:20.881 --> 06:22.681
is coming out of left field
for me.

06:22.683 --> 06:25.984
Is it? Because, Dean, we-we...
we watch<i> The Grinder,</i>

06:25.986 --> 06:27.352
we-we talk about it

06:27.354 --> 06:28.353
while we're watching it,

06:28.355 --> 06:29.654
after we're watching it,

06:29.656 --> 06:31.189
and it feels to me like

06:31.191 --> 06:34.025
we should operate more
in reality.

06:34.027 --> 06:35.660
I just think that maybe

06:35.662 --> 06:39.598
you would benefit
from talking to someone.

06:41.168 --> 06:44.169
You are suggesting
that I go to therapy.

06:44.171 --> 06:46.171
I-I know I find it very useful.
I mean,

06:46.173 --> 06:48.173
I had some adjustments for you,

06:48.175 --> 06:51.710
but I'm hearing that you would
like a complete overhaul.

06:51.712 --> 06:54.012
Not an overhaul.
Just... like, a...

06:54.014 --> 06:55.680
just tone a few things back.

06:55.682 --> 06:57.015
Oh, a tone-back. Oh. Yeah.

06:57.017 --> 06:59.384
Oh. Tone back.
I can tone you back all day.

06:59.386 --> 07:01.720
Okay. But on my terms.

07:01.722 --> 07:03.388
No therapy.

07:03.390 --> 07:05.190
Are you sure?
'Cause, Dean, I'm telling you,

07:05.192 --> 07:07.726
this woman I see, she gets it.

07:07.728 --> 07:10.929
I'll think about it.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.330
Stewart.

07:15.536 --> 07:16.768
Dean.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.570
Good day.

07:18.572 --> 07:20.038
(sighs)

07:20.040 --> 07:22.674
Good day to you.

07:23.877 --> 07:24.943
And if we successfully challenge
those zoning ordinances,

07:24.945 --> 07:26.611
you should be
able to break ground

07:26.613 --> 07:28.280
on five new dealerships
by the spring.

07:28.282 --> 07:30.081
That's impressive.
But can you promise

07:30.083 --> 07:31.249
we'll win the challenges?

07:31.251 --> 07:32.884
Well...
DEAN: We at Sanderson & Yao

07:32.886 --> 07:33.952
don't offer promises.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.221
We offer action.

07:36.223 --> 07:37.389
What? Dean.

07:37.391 --> 07:39.257
Uh, this is my brother.

07:39.259 --> 07:40.892
He has a tendency to...

07:40.894 --> 07:43.428
Fight for justice
with all his might.

07:43.430 --> 07:45.764
I hope that's not
a problem for you.

07:45.766 --> 07:47.265
Why would that
be a problem for me?

07:47.267 --> 07:48.467
It wouldn't. At all.

07:48.469 --> 07:50.101
I couldn't help but overhearing

07:50.103 --> 07:51.970
that you are looking
for representation.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.406
How would you have
overheard that? No one said it.

07:54.408 --> 07:55.574
No one needed to. Dean?

07:55.576 --> 07:56.775
Shh, shh.

07:56.777 --> 07:57.943
The foreplay's not over yet.

07:57.945 --> 07:59.478
Ew. Mr. Foosley, you'll have to

07:59.480 --> 08:01.246
pardon my brother, he...
Wait, wait.

08:01.248 --> 08:03.448
Were you at the bar
this whole time,

08:03.450 --> 08:05.917
just waiting to interject
at the perfect moment?

08:05.919 --> 08:07.919
What? No?

08:07.921 --> 08:10.655
Really? 'Cause something felt
kind of unnatural about it.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.424
Excuse me? Dean, can I
steal you for a second?

08:12.426 --> 08:14.860
Excuse me, just a...
just a quick moment.

08:17.097 --> 08:18.763
What are you doing here?
We talked about this.

08:18.765 --> 08:19.764
You said you were gonna
tone it back.

08:19.766 --> 08:20.799
I said that and then

08:20.801 --> 08:21.800
I thought about it

08:21.802 --> 08:22.767
and I decided this client

08:22.769 --> 08:23.835
is too important to lose

08:23.837 --> 08:25.270
to a lackluster sales pitch.

08:25.272 --> 08:26.438
Dean, this is a big deal Mm-hmm.

08:26.440 --> 08:27.973
And I know
you're trying to help,

08:27.975 --> 08:29.841
but whatever you're doing
is not helping.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.143
Okay? Look at him...
He's-he's all agitated now.

08:32.145 --> 08:34.112
He doesn't want to be here.
No, no, he's all

08:34.114 --> 08:35.647
activated now.

08:35.649 --> 08:37.349
He's reacting emotionally,

08:37.351 --> 08:38.517
which is what you want
when you're

08:38.519 --> 08:39.951
trying to hook an audience.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.019
We've been through this.

08:41.021 --> 08:42.988
Guys, I'm not feeling it.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.789
Uh, Mr. Foosley,
he was just on his way out.

08:44.791 --> 08:46.324
Look, you know, I was leaning
60-40 toward Sanderson,

08:46.326 --> 08:47.959
but I was a little nervous

08:47.961 --> 08:49.628
about this... the whole
actor turned lawyer thing,

08:49.630 --> 08:52.864
but I thought I'd meet,
see it for myself.

08:52.866 --> 08:55.133
And? Yeah, it's a problem. Yeah.

08:55.135 --> 08:56.535
Like I thought. Got it.

08:56.537 --> 08:57.802
Okay, look,
you obviously believe

08:57.804 --> 08:59.137
you're a lawyer because...

08:59.139 --> 09:00.705
you play one on TV,

09:00.707 --> 09:02.140
and that's a little far to me.

09:02.142 --> 09:04.142
I like your style.

09:04.144 --> 09:05.644
You're a good man,
you're a good attorney,

09:05.646 --> 09:08.547
but you got a brick
chained to your ankle

09:08.549 --> 09:11.283
and it's holding you back.

09:20.193 --> 09:21.893
Jillian, thank you
so much for doing this.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.662
Uh, I asked Dean to just
give us five minutes

09:23.664 --> 09:25.730
so we could make sure
we're on the same page.

09:25.732 --> 09:26.831
On the same page? You know,

09:26.833 --> 09:27.999
just to talk to him about

09:28.001 --> 09:29.000
the same things that we've been

09:29.002 --> 09:30.168
talking about in our sessions.

09:30.170 --> 09:31.336
Just to, you know,
bring him back

09:31.338 --> 09:33.038
down to Earth a little bit.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.573
Okay, no, no, no,
this isn't gonna be

09:34.575 --> 09:37.075
you telling me what to
say to your brother.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.044
No, it shouldn't work that way.
That would... No.

09:39.046 --> 09:40.679
Of course. You say

09:40.681 --> 09:42.047
what you are gonna say.

09:42.049 --> 09:44.182
But I think
that you're gonna say

09:44.184 --> 09:46.017
exactly what needs to be said.

09:46.019 --> 09:48.019
Because you're gonna see for
yourself what I've been saying.

09:48.021 --> 09:49.020
Are you done? I am.

09:49.022 --> 09:50.088
Okay.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.023
I think it's time
to bring in Dean now.

09:52.025 --> 09:53.358
Okay. Got it.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.026
But we know what we're saying?

09:55.028 --> 09:58.363
Good-bye, Stewart.
Bye. Oh, if you get hung up

09:58.365 --> 09:59.898
and want to reach out,
I'm on my cell.

09:59.900 --> 10:02.067
You have my number?
I have your phone number.

10:02.069 --> 10:03.435
I'm gonna just call you anyway.
You don't need to do that.

10:03.437 --> 10:04.769
No, then you're gonna
have it in your recents.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.605
Not necessary.
And then it's easier.

10:06.607 --> 10:08.039
And then you don't have to think,
"Oh, scroll, scroll, scroll."

10:08.041 --> 10:09.374
Got it.
It's gonna be right at the top.

10:09.376 --> 10:12.043
Time to go. Yeah.

10:12.045 --> 10:13.044
Hi, Dean.

10:13.046 --> 10:16.915
Hey, Dean. This is Jillian.

10:16.917 --> 10:18.216
She's gonna be helping you.

10:18.218 --> 10:20.051
Jillian.

10:20.053 --> 10:22.053
Hi. You can go ahead

10:22.055 --> 10:23.788
and have a seat
on the couch, okay?

10:23.790 --> 10:24.956
I'm gonna leave you guys to it.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.225
(mouthing) Oh, Stewart, before

10:27.227 --> 10:28.927
you leave, um...

10:28.929 --> 10:31.029
May I say something? Yes.

10:32.933 --> 10:34.132
Thank you for bringing me here.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.935
Um... I've hurt you.

10:36.937 --> 10:38.403
Don't want to hurt you.

10:38.405 --> 10:39.971
And I certainly
don't want to lose

10:39.973 --> 10:41.306
another Foosley.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.074
Thank you, Dean, I don't...

10:43.076 --> 10:45.110
I don't, either.
Yeah. If you say

10:45.112 --> 10:48.079
this is where I need to be,

10:48.081 --> 10:50.448
this<i> is</i> where I need to be.

10:50.450 --> 10:53.752
I am in therapy...

10:53.754 --> 10:55.186
to win therapy.

10:56.923 --> 10:59.324
And I need to make sure
you're on board with that.

10:59.326 --> 11:00.992
You need to make sure

11:00.994 --> 11:03.128
I'm on board with
you winning therapy?

11:03.130 --> 11:05.430
That's right.
Yeah, I'm on board.

11:05.432 --> 11:07.966
Great. Great.

11:07.968 --> 11:10.935
Dean, if anybody can
win therapy, my money's on you.

11:10.937 --> 11:12.971
Well, then we're both
gonna break even.

11:12.973 --> 11:14.339
'Cause my money...

11:14.341 --> 11:16.374
is on you.

11:17.644 --> 11:19.277
DEAN:<i> Wow.</i>

11:19.279 --> 11:20.679
You are right.

11:20.681 --> 11:24.115
She is a miracle... worker.

11:24.117 --> 11:25.984
Dean, that's fantastic.
That's great to hear.

11:25.986 --> 11:28.453
Well, thank<i> you,</i> Stew. I mean,
it was... it was eye-opening.

11:28.455 --> 11:30.522
I can't believe it's taken me
this long to get into therapy.

11:30.524 --> 11:31.956
How long have you been going?

11:31.958 --> 11:33.291
Uh... God, I'm not sure.

11:33.293 --> 11:35.126
Like, maybe October-ish?

11:35.128 --> 11:37.862
Oh, so basically just about
the time I came back to town.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.964
Ah, before, after...
It's hard for me to say

11:39.966 --> 11:41.966
exactly, without
looking at a calendar.

11:41.968 --> 11:43.468
It was right after, remember?

11:43.470 --> 11:45.503
That's it. Well, I'm just

11:45.505 --> 11:47.338
so glad that
you're feeling inspired.

11:47.340 --> 11:48.840
My bro knew what I needed,

11:48.842 --> 11:50.642
and he was right.

11:50.644 --> 11:51.810
I need work.

11:51.812 --> 11:53.011
I don't know, son.

11:53.013 --> 11:54.045
I wouldn't do much.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.047
Aw, thanks, Dad. And, Stew,

11:56.049 --> 11:57.382
I hear you've been making some
pretty great strides yourself.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.017
Congrats on that.

11:59.019 --> 12:02.153
Oh, yeah, uh, yes, thank you.
She-she told you that?

12:02.155 --> 12:04.522
She did.
Well, I just want everybody

12:04.524 --> 12:06.024
to know that I may be coming

12:06.026 --> 12:07.726
at things a little bit
differently now.

12:07.728 --> 12:10.061
So it's a whole
perspective shift, then?

12:10.063 --> 12:12.063
Correct. Like, Deb,

12:12.065 --> 12:13.998
your whole work thing.
I've listened...

12:14.000 --> 12:15.700
but I haven't really listened.

12:15.702 --> 12:17.068
Because it didn't hook me.

12:17.070 --> 12:20.004
But not everything
has to be all big drama.

12:20.006 --> 12:21.840
That is what I've been saying
this whole time.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.341
Ah, Stew, this isn't about you.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.844
It's about Deb now. So, Deb,

12:25.846 --> 12:27.011
talk to me.

12:27.013 --> 12:28.346
Well, not if it's boring.

12:28.348 --> 12:31.182
No.<i> Because</i> it's boring.

12:31.184 --> 12:32.917
Okay. Um...

12:32.919 --> 12:36.020
well, I'm caught between
my two bosses at work.

12:36.022 --> 12:38.757
Caught how? Well, they don't
talk to each other and then I...

12:38.759 --> 12:40.925
You know, I'm learning
that, for me,

12:40.927 --> 12:42.560
it's-it's very important
to take control

12:42.562 --> 12:44.095
of your own life and happiness.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.598
Right. Grab the steering
wheel of your own life

12:46.600 --> 12:48.032
and be the driver.

12:48.034 --> 12:49.100
That's deep.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.735
Yeah, I like that.

12:50.737 --> 12:52.270
Yeah, maybe I should
take the wheel a little more.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.873
And-and Stew, seems like
you could use a little bit of

12:54.875 --> 12:57.375
time behind the wheel as well.
Jillian thought so.

12:57.377 --> 12:59.377
You guys talk a lot about me.
We sure do.

12:59.379 --> 13:00.945
Oh, it's... that's good.

13:00.947 --> 13:03.748
He's giving us a second chance.
Foosley?

13:03.750 --> 13:06.751
Yeah. That's great. But with
all due respect to us, why?

13:06.753 --> 13:08.787
Worked my magic. Called him up,
convinced him that...

13:08.789 --> 13:09.921
Dean has no idea
what he's saying?

13:09.923 --> 13:11.122
That's... basically it. Mm.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.590
Oh, there you are.

13:12.592 --> 13:14.392
Hey, what's Bill Foosley's number?
Why?

13:14.394 --> 13:16.127
I want to call him and apologize
for the other day.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.797
Yeah, I'm just gonna let
you two sort this out.

13:18.799 --> 13:20.398
Really? Oh, yeah.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.066
And... the number is?

13:22.068 --> 13:23.067
Dean, you're not calling him.

13:23.069 --> 13:24.569
Stewart, Do not make me

13:24.571 --> 13:26.070
search for this number
elsewhere.

13:26.072 --> 13:28.072
I will find it. I will call it.

13:28.074 --> 13:29.407
Dean, you are not
talking to Foosley.

13:29.409 --> 13:30.608
You've done enough
damage already.

13:30.610 --> 13:32.076
Well, let me repair that damage.

13:32.078 --> 13:33.077
No, I repaired it. It's done.

13:33.079 --> 13:34.078
It took some doing,

13:34.080 --> 13:35.580
but I got us a second meeting.

13:35.582 --> 13:36.981
Which you are not going to.
Which I'm going to.

13:36.983 --> 13:38.650
Stewart, don't deny me this.

13:38.652 --> 13:39.984
This is very important
for my growth.

13:39.986 --> 13:41.486
And I've made
tremendous progress

13:41.488 --> 13:43.288
since Foosley last saw me.

13:43.290 --> 13:45.256
You mean Tuesday? Come on, man.
Don't clip my wings.

13:45.258 --> 13:46.791
Let me fly. Let me do this.

13:46.793 --> 13:47.926
Dean, it's not happening.
Well...

13:47.928 --> 13:49.928
I'm telling Jillian about this.

13:49.930 --> 13:50.929
Okay, tell Jillian.

13:50.931 --> 13:52.491
I will. Okay.

13:53.099 --> 13:54.465
(sighs)

13:54.467 --> 13:56.267
Oh... Oh!

13:56.269 --> 13:58.829
Oh, I-I'm telling
Jillian about that.

14:06.012 --> 14:08.680
(exclaims) How do you do that?

14:08.682 --> 14:11.349
Jillian says you should let me
go to the meeting with Foosley.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.484
She said that? Yeah. She says
you're being too tough on me.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.019
Really. Yes. She said you're

14:15.021 --> 14:16.187
depriving me of a very important

14:16.189 --> 14:17.789
therapeutic opportunity.

14:17.791 --> 14:19.123
STEWART:
You said I'm too tough on him?!

14:19.125 --> 14:20.625
You always tell me
I'm too passive.

14:20.627 --> 14:23.127
Stewart, you know
I'm not allowed to discuss

14:23.129 --> 14:25.330
what's said in my sessions
with other patients.

14:25.332 --> 14:28.299
But he discussed it. He brought
it up to me. That's allowed.

14:28.301 --> 14:29.801
Okay, well,
he told me that you said

14:29.803 --> 14:31.135
I should give him
a second chance with Foosley.

14:31.137 --> 14:33.304
Mm, I can't confirm
or deny that.

14:33.306 --> 14:37.041
Okay, so, I'm not allowed
to know if you think

14:37.043 --> 14:40.144
I should give Dean
a second chance with Foosley?

14:40.146 --> 14:41.479
No, you're allowed.
I think you should give Dean

14:41.481 --> 14:43.314
a second chance with Foosley.

14:43.316 --> 14:44.515
But you just said
you can't confirm or deny

14:44.517 --> 14:46.484
that you said that. To Dean.

14:46.486 --> 14:48.019
I can't discuss
what Dean and I have discussed,

14:48.021 --> 14:50.321
but you and I can have
our own discussion.

14:50.323 --> 14:52.156
Well, obviously, you and I can
have our own discussion.

14:52.158 --> 14:53.892
If we couldn't do that,
we wouldn't be doing this.

14:53.894 --> 14:55.994
Right. So, we're on the same page.
I don't think so.

14:55.996 --> 14:58.997
No? No! You're saying that

14:58.999 --> 15:00.231
we can have a discussion about
facts that were presented

15:00.233 --> 15:01.566
to you by Dean? Is that right?

15:01.568 --> 15:03.568
Well, so long as I...

15:03.570 --> 15:06.504
don't portray them as having
<i>been</i> presented by Dean, yes.

15:06.506 --> 15:09.807
Mm-hmm. Yeah?

15:15.048 --> 15:19.050
Deb, just checking in with
you on this Q1 P&L report?

15:19.052 --> 15:21.419
It's not quite making sense to
me based on what I asked? Right.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.688
No, yeah, I know that, because
right after you and I spoke,

15:23.690 --> 15:25.556
Dandro called and asked me
to change it all back

15:25.558 --> 15:29.193
and to shred the old version...
All 400 copies of it.

15:29.195 --> 15:31.696
Right, but Dandro's not fully
dialed in on this project.

15:31.698 --> 15:33.231
Let's have you change it
all back again, then get it

15:33.233 --> 15:34.766
copied, collated, and distro'd,

15:34.768 --> 15:36.034
and I'll get Dandro up to speed.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.702
We're trading calls. I...

15:37.704 --> 15:38.937
Oh! DANDRO: Debbie,
how are we looking

15:38.939 --> 15:40.872
on the growth projections?

15:40.874 --> 15:42.874
This seems to be
taking you a long time.

15:42.876 --> 15:44.208
Are you serious?
Did you not just see Coleman

15:44.210 --> 15:45.910
go back
into his office right now?

15:45.912 --> 15:47.712
I didn't. He and I
are trading calls,

15:47.714 --> 15:50.281
but to be honest, Deb, your
tone is a bit troubling.

15:50.283 --> 15:53.051
Oh, my tone?
My-my tone is the problem here?

15:53.053 --> 15:55.253
What's happening here?

15:55.255 --> 15:57.055
Hey, Roy, sorry we
keep missing each other.

15:57.057 --> 16:00.091
Deb, is everything okay? I can
hear you shouting down the hall.

16:00.093 --> 16:02.093
I am... (groaning)

16:02.095 --> 16:05.096
Can you two please
just talk to each other?

16:05.098 --> 16:06.631
Honestly, it's hard to do
over the shouting.

16:06.633 --> 16:07.966
I'm totally with
you on that, Roy.

16:07.968 --> 16:09.233
Deb, I'm not sure you're aware

16:09.235 --> 16:11.069
of how loud you are
with the shouting.

16:11.071 --> 16:13.631
You're gonna have to find a
better way to communicate.

16:14.941 --> 16:17.742
STEWART: And purely on
spec, we've prepared

16:17.744 --> 16:20.078
these motions ready to file
on behalf of Foosley Motors.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.080
Oh, wow, that must have been
a lot of work.

16:22.082 --> 16:23.281
We put our whole team on it.

16:23.283 --> 16:24.782
The motions petition
for injunctions

16:24.784 --> 16:26.417
against the interim
control ordinances.

16:26.419 --> 16:27.585
This is really strong.

16:27.587 --> 16:29.287
May I say something?
Maybe you shouldn't.

16:29.289 --> 16:31.923
You want to down a shot and
then say it from the bar?

16:31.925 --> 16:33.925
No, no, those days
are behind me.

16:33.927 --> 16:35.960
No, I just want to apologize.

16:35.962 --> 16:38.796
I was playing someone that
I wasn't, and I got caught up.

16:38.798 --> 16:41.332
Dean, I don't think Mr. Foosley wants
to hear. No, no, no, no, I like this.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.101
Sounds like you've done
some introspection.

16:43.103 --> 16:45.770
I have, um,
because of my brother.

16:45.772 --> 16:47.939
He introduced me
to a therapist, and

16:47.941 --> 16:51.109
I am seeing the world through
a completely different lens.

16:51.111 --> 16:54.112
(phone buzzing)
Excuse me. Um, that's my wife.

16:54.114 --> 16:55.947
I'm just gonna take this,
uh, really quickly.

16:55.949 --> 16:58.049
I'll be right back.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.787
You quit your job?
Just like that?!

17:02.789 --> 17:07.792
It was this incredible moment
of clarity, hon. I mean,

17:07.794 --> 17:10.361
Dandro was being
all-all Dandro, and-and

17:10.363 --> 17:13.297
Coleman was pulling
his-his usual Coleman bullcrap,

17:13.299 --> 17:15.366
and-and I just said, "Enough!"

17:15.368 --> 17:17.802
Wow. So, it just sounds like one
of those spur-of-the-moment,

17:17.804 --> 17:19.670
don't-even-talk-to me-about-it
kind of things.

17:19.672 --> 17:21.839
Oh, honey, you know that I was
miserable there, and it's like

17:21.841 --> 17:24.208
Dean said. You know, you can
only control your own happiness.

17:24.210 --> 17:27.678
So I just... I grabbed
that steering wheel, and

17:27.680 --> 17:30.348
I... I got to say,
honey, it feels good. I mean,

17:30.350 --> 17:33.151
it feels good
to drive a little bit.

17:33.153 --> 17:35.653
It's like Dean said. So we're
taking advice from Dean now.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.488
Life advice from Dean...
Is that what we're doing?

17:37.490 --> 17:40.892
Well... I'm gonna go, Deb.

17:40.894 --> 17:42.894
You have to take control, Bill.
Ah.

17:42.896 --> 17:44.328
Grab the steering wheel.
I got to grab the wheel.

17:44.330 --> 17:45.997
There's no overcorrecting.

17:45.999 --> 17:48.866
'Cause otherwise, where are we?
Uh, riding shotgun?

17:48.868 --> 17:51.002
Oh, at best. There's a high
probability that we're in the...

17:51.004 --> 17:52.537
back seat. Back seat, right.

17:52.539 --> 17:54.572
Right. That's a great analogy.

17:54.574 --> 17:57.842
Everything okay? Yeah, yeah,
everything's fine. (Clears his throat)

17:57.844 --> 18:00.078
Really? Because
you seem a little agitated.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.847
You picking any of this up, Bill?
100%.

18:02.849 --> 18:06.551
I'm good. Just, uh...
just activated, so... Oh.

18:06.553 --> 18:08.086
Great, because we were just
going through...

18:08.088 --> 18:09.687
She's leaving you, isn't she?

18:09.689 --> 18:12.557
I know that look.
My wife is not leaving me.

18:12.559 --> 18:15.059
Good, because we should probably get to...
No, no, no, I'm...

18:15.061 --> 18:17.528
This feels more important.
Were there any signs at all?

18:17.530 --> 18:20.531
Maybe texts from another man?
She quit.

18:20.533 --> 18:23.034
Okay, she... she quit her job

18:23.036 --> 18:25.536
without even talking to me
because of you

18:25.538 --> 18:28.206
and the ridiculous
grab-the-wheel stuff.

18:28.208 --> 18:30.241
Yeah, that's good stuff.
I found it helpful.

18:30.243 --> 18:32.076
We should probably
talk about this...

18:32.078 --> 18:34.712
You couldn't just go to therapy
like a normal person, could you?

18:34.714 --> 18:37.949
We're in a meeting with a client. We are
having a meeting that you shouldn't

18:37.951 --> 18:40.952
even be at. Oh, I see. This is
about something much deeper.

18:40.954 --> 18:42.086
FOOSLEY: I just saw that, too.

18:42.088 --> 18:43.921
This isn't a... It's a global.

18:43.923 --> 18:45.957
This is not a just-tonight
thing. Maybe we should get

18:45.959 --> 18:48.199
the check.
No, don't get the check!

18:49.562 --> 18:53.131
Ah! You just grabbed my wrist
pretty aggressively. Mm-hmm.

18:57.971 --> 18:59.804
So you grabbed him.

18:59.806 --> 19:03.941
No, I was just stopping him
from getting the check,

19:03.943 --> 19:05.276
and then, it turned
into a whole...

19:05.278 --> 19:06.978
Why-why are you writing?
Why is that...?

19:06.980 --> 19:08.913
Have you had violent tendencies
in the past?

19:08.915 --> 19:11.482
What?! No! You shoved
me the other day.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.751
In the kitchenette, remember?
I remember.

19:13.753 --> 19:16.320
And more writing. I don't
under... Okay, sure, just...

19:16.322 --> 19:18.289
So you attacked him?
It wasn't an att...

19:18.291 --> 19:20.258
The only reason
this happened, Dean,

19:20.260 --> 19:22.760
is because you told Deb
to quit her job.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.428
Well, he didn't tell me to that.

19:24.430 --> 19:26.631
I quit on my own because
I got behind the wheel.

19:26.633 --> 19:28.599
Oh, right, yes, everyone's
getting behind the wheel.

19:28.601 --> 19:30.935
I forgot. Why don't we all grab
a wheel? Right, Jillian?

19:30.937 --> 19:32.603
So you don't think
that your brother

19:32.605 --> 19:34.605
and your wife should
take control of their lives?

19:34.607 --> 19:37.608
Is that it? Did we
just crack this?

19:37.610 --> 19:40.011
No, Dean, we did not
just crack this. This...

19:40.013 --> 19:42.180
See, this is why I wanted to get
us all in the same room,

19:42.182 --> 19:44.482
so we could clear up
some of the confusion.

19:44.484 --> 19:45.983
I'm not confused. I feel great.

19:45.985 --> 19:47.785
Yeah, I feel great, too.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.620
He's just upset because I didn't
discuss it with him first.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.122
Yeah, that's part of it, yes.

19:51.124 --> 19:52.957
But is it possible
that she didn't discuss it

19:52.959 --> 19:54.992
with you first
because of how you might react?

19:54.994 --> 19:56.494
I think that is it.
What?! Mm-hmm.

19:56.496 --> 19:57.962
Oh, this is so healthy.

19:57.964 --> 19:59.964
That means the world to me.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.199
I'm just saying, we shouldn't be
telling everyone

20:01.201 --> 20:03.034
in my life to grab a wheel.

20:03.036 --> 20:05.703
Well, in fairness, she didn't
tell me to grab the wheel.

20:05.705 --> 20:06.971
All right, but you told Dean,

20:06.973 --> 20:09.006
and then Dean
passed it along, so...

20:09.008 --> 20:10.975
I can't tell you
if I said that to Dean.

20:10.977 --> 20:12.977
Dean, did she say that to you?

20:12.979 --> 20:15.513
She did. Okay, great.

20:15.515 --> 20:17.648
So now can you say that you said it?
I cannot.

20:17.650 --> 20:19.350
He just said it
right now in front of you.

20:19.352 --> 20:20.885
Even now you can't...
you can't say that you said it?

20:20.887 --> 20:23.154
He said you said it,
and you heard him.

20:23.156 --> 20:24.722
I heard that,
and I still cannot.

20:24.724 --> 20:27.124
Excellent.

20:28.194 --> 20:29.994
Still writing. I don't
understand how much you...

20:29.996 --> 20:31.329
DEAN: <i>Great session.</i>

20:31.331 --> 20:33.831
Yeah. Having Deb involved
in it... so smart.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.833
You know,
the Foosley debacle aside,

20:35.835 --> 20:37.535
I'm feeling very positive
about Jillian,

20:37.537 --> 20:39.170
and have you to thank for it.

20:39.172 --> 20:40.504
Happy to help, Dean.

20:40.506 --> 20:42.006
You are, aren't you?

20:42.008 --> 20:44.575
Helping is what makes you happy.

20:44.577 --> 20:46.010
Yeah, I guess it is.

20:46.012 --> 20:47.411
You know, you were right.

20:47.413 --> 20:49.747
I have a lot of work to do.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.515
It wasn't just a tone-back.

20:51.517 --> 20:54.852
It's an overhaul,
and I know that now.

20:54.854 --> 20:57.221
Well, that's great, Dean.
So, no more<i> Grinder.</i>

20:57.223 --> 21:00.691
And more importantly, Stewart...

21:00.693 --> 21:02.893
no more drama.

21:02.895 --> 21:05.363
You're not gonna believe
this. I just got served.

21:05.365 --> 21:06.931
This punk is suing me

21:06.933 --> 21:08.266
for malpractice.

21:11.104 --> 21:14.272
He's coming
after the whole damn firm.
