WEBVTT

02:33.195 --> 02:36.114
-I just wanted it. That's all.
-But why did you want it?

02:37.115 --> 02:38.617
I just did. It was a cool knife.

02:39.451 --> 02:42.287
The DA will say you bought it
because you were being bullied by Ben.

02:42.371 --> 02:43.956
They're gonna use that as motive.

02:44.373 --> 02:45.374
But it wasn't.

02:45.457 --> 02:47.709
Your friend Derek
seems to think otherwise.

02:47.793 --> 02:51.755
Tell me why you think Derek connected
your knife to what happened to Ben.

02:54.049 --> 02:55.300
I don't know.

02:56.093 --> 02:58.387
Maybe he's the real killer,
and he wants to blame me for it.

02:58.470 --> 02:59.930
-Whoa. Hold on a minute.
-What?

03:00.013 --> 03:01.640
-I'm just saying.
-This isn't a game, Jacob.

03:01.723 --> 03:04.518
If you think Derek
had something to do with this,

03:04.601 --> 03:05.602
we need to know why you think it.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.688
You really think Derek had
something to do with this?

03:09.314 --> 03:10.315
I don't.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.902
You asked me why he's blaming me.
I don't know why.

03:14.987 --> 03:17.906
Had you ever said anything to him
about wanting to hurt Ben?

03:19.408 --> 03:21.326
-I don't think so.
-That's not a no.

03:23.287 --> 03:27.207
Maybe,
but not in a way that meant anything.

03:27.875 --> 03:30.377
I mean, Derek didn't like him either.
A lot of kids didn't.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.087
Where is the knife now?

03:36.341 --> 03:37.467
Andy, you have it?

03:38.927 --> 03:41.096
It was a dangerous weapon.
I threw it away.

03:42.764 --> 03:44.600
I did what any parent would've done.

03:45.475 --> 03:46.810
So the knife is gone?

03:46.894 --> 03:48.854
This is well before
Jacob was considered a suspect.

03:48.937 --> 03:50.647
Andy, I'm not accusing you of anything.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.107
I'm trying to ascertain what happened.

03:52.191 --> 03:54.860
Right, right, right. Yes.
Sorry. It's gone.

03:58.488 --> 04:01.491
Had you taken it to school
on the day Ben was killed?

04:02.409 --> 04:03.410
No.

04:03.493 --> 04:05.454
Have it with you in the park that morning?

04:06.288 --> 04:09.875
When you left for school,
did you follow your usual route?

04:12.294 --> 04:13.670
Yeah.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.547
So the spot where Ben was killed

04:15.631 --> 04:18.841
just happened to be on
the very same path you normally follow?

04:20.219 --> 04:22.221
I guess so.

04:22.304 --> 04:24.056
I never really thought about it that way.

04:24.139 --> 04:28.352
Before you discovered Ben's body,
did you see or hear anything unusual?

04:29.561 --> 04:30.604
You sure?

04:31.855 --> 04:34.441
I was just walking, and then...

04:35.901 --> 04:36.902
there he was,

04:37.402 --> 04:40.614
just lying there
at the bottom of this slope,

04:41.031 --> 04:42.199
in a bunch of leaves.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.492
Dry leaves or wet leaves?

04:44.535 --> 04:45.536
Wet.

04:45.953 --> 04:49.873
So, you found this body lying
on the ground. What did you do?

04:50.624 --> 04:53.043
-I kind of called his name, like--
-Ben?

04:53.418 --> 04:55.712
"Ben? Ben? Are you okay?"

04:55.796 --> 04:57.548
You recognized him right away?

04:58.590 --> 04:59.591
Yeah.

04:59.675 --> 05:02.761
In the police report,
you said that he was lying face down,

05:02.845 --> 05:04.513
his head at the bottom of the slope.

05:04.596 --> 05:06.431
And unless I'm missing something,
from that angle,

05:06.515 --> 05:08.684
all you could see
was the bottom of his sneakers?

05:09.685 --> 05:12.271
No. I could see more than that.

05:13.689 --> 05:15.524
So, then what?

05:15.607 --> 05:17.776
He wasn't moving, so I went down the hill

05:17.860 --> 05:19.778
to see if he was hurt or something.

05:20.445 --> 05:21.780
Did you cry out for help?

05:23.073 --> 05:24.074
No.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.243
Did it occur to you to call 911?

05:27.911 --> 05:29.913
Yeah, but I didn't--

05:30.664 --> 05:32.541
I didn't know what it was at first.

05:32.624 --> 05:36.503
I thought it could've been an accident.

05:36.587 --> 05:38.213
Like maybe he fell or something.

05:38.297 --> 05:39.965
Fell on what exactly?

05:40.048 --> 05:41.466
On-- I don't know. I'm just saying--

05:41.550 --> 05:43.719
And if it was an accident,
you wouldn't need to call 911?

05:43.802 --> 05:46.180
No. It's-- That's--

05:47.639 --> 05:48.891
You're twisting things.

05:48.974 --> 05:50.225
Why didn't you just call me?

05:50.309 --> 05:51.310
Andy, if you don't mind...

05:51.393 --> 05:52.936
I thought I'd get in trouble or something.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.105
-In trouble?
-Andy, please.

05:57.858 --> 05:58.942
What happened next, Jacob?

06:00.736 --> 06:04.615
I went down the hill,
and I got down beside him.

06:04.948 --> 06:06.283
Got down on your knees.

06:06.909 --> 06:08.076
I think so. Yeah.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.578
In the wet leaves?

06:10.537 --> 06:11.663
Or maybe I was standing.

06:11.747 --> 06:13.248
Stayed standing?

06:13.582 --> 06:15.334
I honestly don't remember.

06:16.168 --> 06:18.086
Derek saw you at school
a short while later.

06:18.170 --> 06:20.464
He said that your clothes
looked perfectly clean.

06:22.466 --> 06:24.009
I guess I was standing, then.

06:25.177 --> 06:26.345
Then what?

06:27.846 --> 06:31.058
Then I rolled him over to check on him.

06:31.141 --> 06:33.393
How did you roll him over?
With your foot? Your hands?

06:33.477 --> 06:35.979
-Hand.
-Even though you were standing?

06:36.063 --> 06:40.317
I bent down.
I remember bending down to turn him over.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.362
Is that how your fingerprint wound up
on the tag of Ben's sweatshirt?

06:43.779 --> 06:45.113
Maybe. I guess.

06:45.197 --> 06:47.658
So you rolled him over by his collar.

06:48.158 --> 06:49.201
Yes, right. So...

06:50.369 --> 06:53.664
that's when I saw the blood,
and I started freaking out.

06:53.747 --> 06:57.417
Because face up, it was now apparent
that Ben had been attacked.

06:58.710 --> 07:01.505
-Yeah.
-Was there a lot of blood?

07:03.048 --> 07:04.049
Yes.

07:04.800 --> 07:08.345
And still, your phone
remained in your pocket.

07:08.428 --> 07:12.683
I got scared, and I figured someone else
would find him pretty soon anyways.

07:13.809 --> 07:15.519
You said you were freaking out.

07:16.186 --> 07:17.521
Yes, I was.

07:17.604 --> 07:19.106
When Derek saw you later at school,

07:19.189 --> 07:21.942
he described you
as being in a good mood that morning.

07:24.695 --> 07:25.946
I didn't want him to know.

07:26.572 --> 07:30.534
Why not? He's your good friend, isn't he?
Why didn't you feel like you could tell--

07:30.617 --> 07:32.077
I don't know why. I just didn't, okay?

07:32.160 --> 07:33.328
-Hey.
-What?

07:33.412 --> 07:34.663
It's obvious she doesn't believe me.

07:34.746 --> 07:37.875
Jacob, let me tell you something.
It doesn't matter if I believe you.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.793
I'm your lawyer, not your mom or dad.

07:41.253 --> 07:42.796
Well, that's what really happened.

07:42.880 --> 07:44.173
No one's saying it didn't.

07:44.256 --> 07:46.758
Yeah, right. You don't think I can tell
the way you're asking those questions?

07:46.842 --> 07:47.968
What way is that?

07:48.051 --> 07:50.470
-I feel like you're trying to trick me.
-What question was a trick?

07:50.554 --> 07:52.347
-You know what I mean.
-Actually, I don't.

07:52.431 --> 07:54.474
In what way am I trying to trick you?

07:54.558 --> 07:57.394
Joanna, please. You made your point.

08:02.608 --> 08:05.277
Jacob, I am sorry that I upset you,
but I promise you,

08:05.360 --> 08:09.239
what we are doing here is nothing compared
to what Mr. Logiudice will do to you

08:09.323 --> 08:10.574
if you take the stand.

08:11.241 --> 08:13.243
Your story has holes in it.

08:13.911 --> 08:16.288
I don't know why,
and maybe you don't either.

08:16.371 --> 08:19.458
Our memories are often less reliable
than we think,

08:19.541 --> 08:22.503
particularly in moments of stress.

08:23.629 --> 08:27.549
But if I were a juror,
I'd have a lot of questions.

08:29.343 --> 08:30.761
It's the truth.

08:31.929 --> 08:34.097
Not all the details.
You messed me up on those.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.725
Okay. Okay.

08:36.808 --> 08:40.812
It's not okay. She just said
the jury won't believe me, so...

08:40.895 --> 08:42.773
That's why we're not gonna
put you on the witness stand.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.358
I think that's wise.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.110
How will I tell my story?

08:47.653 --> 08:49.279
That's my job, not yours.

08:49.363 --> 08:51.907
-Then what's his defense?
-He doesn't need one.

08:52.574 --> 08:53.617
What?

08:53.700 --> 08:55.285
Burden of proof is on the prosecution.

08:55.369 --> 08:57.621
Exactly.
We're just going to attack their case

08:57.704 --> 09:00.666
until there is nothing left to attack.

09:00.749 --> 09:02.000
That's our defense.

09:04.670 --> 09:08.173
All right, we'll convene again
next week, young man.

09:10.133 --> 09:11.218
You guys go wait in the car.

09:11.301 --> 09:13.262
I'm just gonna talk to Joanna
for a second, okay?

09:20.227 --> 09:21.228
It's a mistake.

09:21.311 --> 09:23.772
Oh, you don't honestly think
he belongs on the stand.

09:23.856 --> 09:25.816
No, of course not,
but we can't just deflect.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.777
Juries want a story,
and we gotta give 'em one. A better one.

09:28.861 --> 09:32.531
I don't disagree, but right now,
all the evidence points one way.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.993
And I'm sorry,
I'm speaking to you lawyer-to-lawyer here.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.494
The knife they found in the park--

09:37.578 --> 09:40.205
You saw the forensics report.
It's not a match.

09:40.998 --> 09:42.499
He didn't do it, Joanna.

09:43.292 --> 09:45.711
I know his story sucks, but he's a kid.

09:45.794 --> 09:47.421
They get confused. They say dumb things.

09:47.504 --> 09:48.630
I know.

09:48.714 --> 09:49.715
He's innocent.

09:51.425 --> 09:53.010
We're gonna get him through this,
I promise,

09:53.093 --> 09:56.054
but when you start talking about
giving the jury a better story...

09:56.138 --> 09:57.598
The story is Leonard Patz.

09:58.015 --> 09:59.933
There is nothing
connecting him to this case.

10:00.017 --> 10:02.603
Yeah, 'cause no one's looked.
No one's taken the time.

10:03.061 --> 10:06.190
I know there's something there,
and I'm not gonna stop until I find it.

10:07.816 --> 10:09.943
Just tread carefully, okay?

10:10.861 --> 10:11.862
Okay.

10:12.905 --> 10:16.033
Oh, and I forgot to mention, I got
a voice mail from a Globe reporter.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.619
I think they're in town doing
some magazine piece on this.

10:18.702 --> 10:20.662
If you and Laurie get approached, do not--

10:20.746 --> 10:21.955
Yeah, yeah. Obviously.

10:22.039 --> 10:24.458
Any press is bad press right now.

10:25.501 --> 10:26.585
Thanks, Joanna.

10:36.678 --> 10:38.597
Mrs. Hazen said to come to the office.

10:54.613 --> 10:55.781
I was told--

10:55.864 --> 10:57.950
Come on in, Derek.
Have a seat next to your mom.

11:24.893 --> 11:28.021
Ma, is Middle East
considered Africa or Asia?

11:30.732 --> 11:32.234
I think it's part of both.

11:55.591 --> 11:57.426
I don't get why
we have to do this every night.

11:57.968 --> 11:58.969
Eat?

11:59.052 --> 12:01.513
No, have this big sit-down dinner.

12:02.723 --> 12:04.474
We never used to. Not like this.

12:05.100 --> 12:07.144
Well, we do now.

12:09.605 --> 12:11.565
It's like we're trying
to pretend we're normal.

12:11.648 --> 12:12.900
Is that so bad?

12:12.983 --> 12:14.026
It is when it's fake normal.

12:14.109 --> 12:16.069
Jacob, what do you want us to do?

12:16.987 --> 12:18.614
We've never been in this situation before.

12:18.697 --> 12:21.617
What does a parent do?
Just tell me, and I'll do it.

12:21.950 --> 12:25.162
You wanna go for burgers at Lee's
and have the whole town stare at us?

12:25.245 --> 12:27.039
That's fine. We can do that.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.249
-Honey.
-No! I mean it.

12:29.333 --> 12:30.876
Maybe we're doing this wrong,

12:30.959 --> 12:33.170
acting like prisoners in our own home,

12:33.253 --> 12:36.173
sneaking out at all hours
just to get a simple errand done.

12:36.632 --> 12:40.928
Just tell me what to do, because
I have absolutely no idea anymore. Okay?

12:46.517 --> 12:49.394
Okay. I'm sorry.

12:50.938 --> 12:52.356
I shouldn't have said anything.

12:54.900 --> 12:55.943
It's fine.

12:59.571 --> 13:01.573
We can order pizza tomorrow.

13:14.920 --> 13:17.840
You guys hear about the hipster
who burned his mouth on his pizza?

13:20.300 --> 13:22.553
He ate it before it was considered cool.

13:28.934 --> 13:31.103
Got a telegram from headquarters today.

13:31.645 --> 13:32.855
Headquarters? What is it?

13:33.313 --> 13:37.067
Well, it's a big building where generals
meet, but that's not important right now.

13:37.526 --> 13:40.153
They cleared you of any blame
for what happened on that raid.

13:40.237 --> 13:42.739
-Isn't that good news?
-I can't believe you've never seen this.

13:42.823 --> 13:45.284
We should make this a thing,
like movie night or something.

13:45.367 --> 13:46.368
Works for me.

13:46.451 --> 13:48.787
Because of my mistake,
six men didn't return from that raid.

13:48.871 --> 13:51.373
Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning.

13:52.708 --> 13:56.378
Well, Dr. Sandler says you'll be out
in a week. Isn't that wonderful?

13:57.921 --> 14:00.048
Wish I could say the same for George Zipp.

14:01.216 --> 14:05.220
Be patient, Ted. Nobody expects you
to get over this immediately.

14:05.846 --> 14:08.682
Hey, Striker, how about a break?
I'm gettin' tired.

14:10.142 --> 14:11.935
Yeah, all right. Take five.

14:13.103 --> 14:14.104
Thanks.

14:14.980 --> 14:18.150
I found a wonderful apartment for us.

14:18.525 --> 14:21.278
Has a brick fireplace
and a cute little bedroom

14:21.361 --> 14:23.197
with mirrors on the ceiling, and...

14:23.864 --> 14:25.657
Red Leader! Red Leader, I'm going down!

14:26.617 --> 14:27.701
Captain Geline.

14:29.786 --> 14:31.914
He thinks he's a pilot
still fighting the war.

14:34.082 --> 14:35.792
I found the tunnel, Johnson!

15:02.736 --> 15:06.949
Directing your attention to those
documents collectively marked Exhibit 12.

15:08.450 --> 15:10.327
On May 30th of last year,

15:10.410 --> 15:13.747
the Meriden Messenger received
an e-mail through its website

15:13.830 --> 15:18.502
requesting any and all reporting
on former resident William James Barber

15:18.585 --> 15:24.174
between the dates of December 1986
and January 1988.

15:24.258 --> 15:26.343
Copies were sent out
to a Ms. Agnes Martin.

15:27.261 --> 15:30.472
-Do you recognize this address?
-It's our home.

15:31.181 --> 15:33.100
And who's Agnes Martin?

15:34.434 --> 15:37.145
She's an abstract painter.
Laurie was an Art History major.

15:37.229 --> 15:38.397
A pseudonym then.

15:40.691 --> 15:42.943
Were you aware that she had done this?

15:44.069 --> 15:45.153
Not at the time. No.

15:45.654 --> 15:47.239
And why do you believe she did?

15:49.157 --> 15:52.828
Probably wasn't very much online.
Wasn't really big news when it happened.

15:53.203 --> 15:55.664
What wasn't very big news?

16:00.002 --> 16:01.003
The murder.

16:02.171 --> 16:03.589
Could you be more specific?

16:05.257 --> 16:06.633
The murder my father committed.

16:06.717 --> 16:10.679
And rape. He raped his 19-year-old victim
as well. Is that right?

16:15.559 --> 16:16.560
Yes.

16:20.022 --> 16:23.442
Is it true that your wife had no knowledge
of your father's history

16:23.525 --> 16:25.444
-prior to Jacob's arrest?
-Yes.

16:26.153 --> 16:29.239
In fact,
she didn't even know the man existed.

16:30.574 --> 16:32.075
That must've been quite a shock.

16:32.993 --> 16:35.954
She took it in stride.
We had bigger things to worry about.

16:36.371 --> 16:40.083
Still. To find out that your husband's
father was none other than...

16:41.502 --> 16:45.506
What was the nickname they call him?
Comes up in a few of these articles.

16:46.673 --> 16:47.883
Bloody Billy.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.512
Right. Bloody Billy Barber.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.201
Hey, Billy.

17:14.284 --> 17:15.493
How you doing, Andy?

17:16.703 --> 17:18.747
What's the matter, kid? Afraid of me?

17:18.829 --> 17:20.374
-Billy, stop.
-Look at me.

17:20.457 --> 17:21.916
-You're scaring him.
-Shut up.

17:22.376 --> 17:24.752
I said look at me.

17:26.088 --> 17:28.924
You scared of me? Huh?

17:29.508 --> 17:30.759
He's shy, okay?

17:30.843 --> 17:32.678
-Look at me.
-Stop.

17:32.761 --> 17:34.304
-You afraid of me, Andy?
-Stop it.

17:34.388 --> 17:36.473
-Look at your old man.
-That's it. We're going.

17:36.557 --> 17:38.809
-Look at me now!
-Stop it! Billy, stop!

18:34.656 --> 18:35.657
Andy?

18:36.700 --> 18:37.701
Yeah?

18:39.286 --> 18:43.248
Is there a part of you,
even a tiny part...

18:45.209 --> 18:46.710
thinks he might've done it?

18:52.466 --> 18:53.592
Of course not.

20:08.709 --> 20:11.253
-Mrs. McGrath?
-Who's asking?

20:11.753 --> 20:14.715
I represent Jacob Barber. I was hoping
I could speak to your son, Matthew.

20:14.798 --> 20:15.966
Jacob who?

20:17.259 --> 20:18.635
The murder in Cold Spring Park.

20:19.136 --> 20:22.472
Oh, right. The kid. You his lawyer?

20:23.140 --> 20:24.224
His father, actually.

20:25.350 --> 20:26.351
No shit.

20:27.144 --> 20:28.270
Is Matthew here?

20:29.188 --> 20:31.565
Yeah, he's here.
What's he got to do with it?

20:31.648 --> 20:34.443
No, not him. Leonard Patz.

20:37.154 --> 20:38.155
All right.

20:43.952 --> 20:46.371
That's Amelia. Don't try to pet her,
though. She's a bitch.

20:46.455 --> 20:47.539
Matt!

20:47.623 --> 20:50.042
He's in there with his girlfriend,
doing God knows what.

20:50.125 --> 20:51.376
These freaking kids.

20:51.460 --> 20:54.046
Well, I don't have to tell you.
I mean, look who I'm talking to.

20:54.129 --> 20:55.130
Matt!

20:55.506 --> 20:57.257
Hey, how'd you get our names, anyway?

20:57.341 --> 20:59.801
I thought sex victims
are supposed to be confidential.

20:59.885 --> 21:01.762
I used to work with the DA's office.

21:02.638 --> 21:05.057
I'm just trying to get some information
on Leonard Patz. That's all.

21:06.016 --> 21:07.851
You know what he did to Matt, right?

21:09.394 --> 21:12.481
-He groped him in the library.
-He groped him in the balls.

21:12.940 --> 21:14.942
-Matt!
-What?

21:15.442 --> 21:17.194
I'm calling your goddamn name!

21:17.277 --> 21:19.530
There's a man here
who wants to speak to ya!

21:29.790 --> 21:32.835
-You're Matthew McGrath?
-Matt. Who are you?

21:32.918 --> 21:35.462
Oh, shit. Wait. I've seen you on TV.

21:35.879 --> 21:38.048
His kid's the one
they think killed that kid at Archer.

21:38.131 --> 21:40.384
Listen, I just wanted to get
some information on Leonard Patz.

21:40.467 --> 21:42.594
Maybe there's somewhere you and I
can talk in private.

21:42.678 --> 21:44.054
Who says I wanna talk to you at all?

21:44.471 --> 21:46.431
-Hey, Matthew.
-Shut up, Ma.

21:47.349 --> 21:49.518
Look,
I don't know anything about it, okay?

21:49.601 --> 21:51.687
I don't know what you heard.
But whatever it was, was wrong.

21:51.770 --> 21:52.813
Okay.

21:55.482 --> 21:58.360
So, what? You think Patz was
the one who killed that kid in the park?

21:58.944 --> 22:01.572
I don't know. Do you?

22:01.655 --> 22:03.532
Dude, I just said
I don't wanna talk to you.

22:04.908 --> 22:06.660
Well, I'm gonna level with you, Matt.

22:07.661 --> 22:09.121
I don't really give a shit what you want.

22:09.204 --> 22:12.749
I read that statement
you gave to the police. I didn't buy it.

22:12.833 --> 22:15.752
Seeing as how they dropped the case,
I'm guessing they didn't buy it either.

22:15.836 --> 22:19.298
You said Patz approached you in a library,
chatted you up for about an hour,

22:19.381 --> 22:21.425
followed you into a bathroom,
grabbed your crotch,

22:21.508 --> 22:23.635
and then took off. Is that right?

22:24.261 --> 22:25.345
Yeah, so?

22:25.429 --> 22:27.598
So, I'm supposed to believe a registered
sex offender, on probation,

22:27.681 --> 22:29.975
is gonna risk ten years in prison
to cop a feel on a kid

22:30.058 --> 22:32.186
that wouldn't think twice
about beating the shit out of him?

22:32.269 --> 22:33.854
Come on. That doesn't track.

22:34.521 --> 22:38.483
The only thing I'd have a harder time
believing is that you were in a library.

22:39.026 --> 22:42.279
What's your connection to Patz?
You his dealer? Lover?

22:42.362 --> 22:43.363
Fuck you.

22:43.447 --> 22:46.408
Did Patz say anything about being
in the park the morning of the murder?

22:48.076 --> 22:49.411
Don't look at her. Look at me.

22:50.120 --> 22:52.164
If you know something about
the case against my son,

22:52.247 --> 22:54.333
you have to tell me. Now.

23:02.674 --> 23:04.259
Ma, make him go.

23:04.343 --> 23:06.637
-My son's life is on the line, Matt.
-You gotta get outta here.

23:06.720 --> 23:08.722
-I don't fucking know anything.
-His life is on the line. You hear me?

23:08.805 --> 23:10.015
-You go to your room.
-My son's freedom.

23:10.098 --> 23:11.767
-I don't know anything.
-Give me any bit of information.

23:11.850 --> 23:13.185
-Get the fuck out!
-Shut up! Shut your face!

23:13.268 --> 23:14.937
You get out of my house!
I don't want you here!

23:15.020 --> 23:16.230
I need you to do the right thing.

23:16.313 --> 23:18.357
Get out. I don't know
who the fuck you think you are.

23:22.486 --> 23:25.864
Just do the right thing, Matt.
Your mother has my number.

24:55.829 --> 24:57.539
Sorry. We ran a little long.

24:57.623 --> 25:01.293
Really nice meeting you, Jacob. I look
forward to us talking again next Tuesday.

25:01.376 --> 25:02.419
All right.

25:03.670 --> 25:07.257
He's a very good sport.
He was really focused and he was--

25:09.092 --> 25:10.135
Is everything okay?

25:11.011 --> 25:14.139
-Yeah. I... Yeah. Sorry.
-Okay.

25:14.223 --> 25:15.224
Don't worry about it.

25:16.725 --> 25:19.645
-We're going to be late for his tutor.
-Yeah, okay. Of course.

25:21.522 --> 25:23.941
-You take care, okay?
-Yeah.

27:40.536 --> 27:41.537
Honey?

28:01.265 --> 28:02.975
Yeah. Shoot him. Shoot him, right there.

28:03.058 --> 28:03.892
Yeah, shoot him.

28:03.976 --> 28:05.435
What the hell did I tell you abo--

28:08.230 --> 28:09.481
Sorry.

28:10.899 --> 28:13.402
This is Sarah from school.

28:14.528 --> 28:16.154
Right. Okay, hi.

28:16.947 --> 28:19.575
We met before.
When you came to Archer that day.

28:19.658 --> 28:22.327
-Of course, of course. How are you?
-I'm fine, thanks.

28:22.411 --> 28:23.662
Nice to see you.

28:26.373 --> 28:28.375
I was just... checking in.

28:30.586 --> 28:31.712
Where's Mom?

28:31.795 --> 28:35.090
I'm not sure. She said something about
meeting someone from work.

28:35.632 --> 28:38.260
Okay. Well...

28:39.845 --> 28:40.888
have fun.

28:43.348 --> 28:44.516
Right. Sorry.

28:47.728 --> 28:49.688
All right.
That guy right there. To the left.

28:51.607 --> 28:53.233
No, no, no. Yeah. Okay.

28:55.068 --> 28:56.528
-Welcome.
-Hi, thank you.

28:56.987 --> 28:57.988
And one for me.

28:59.740 --> 29:01.033
Good evening. Come on in.

29:47.079 --> 29:48.205
Hi.

29:49.915 --> 29:51.083
Yeah, I know.

29:52.459 --> 29:54.127
Cara asked me to dinner.

29:56.421 --> 29:58.090
Yeah, I thought so too.

30:01.093 --> 30:02.344
I don't know.

30:04.847 --> 30:06.557
Maybe 8:00, 8:30.

30:08.600 --> 30:10.310
Okay. You too.

30:16.859 --> 30:17.860
Salad and fries up.

30:23.240 --> 30:25.742
You didn't say if you wanted
the dressing mixed in or on the side,

30:25.826 --> 30:27.119
so I just put it on the side.

30:27.578 --> 30:28.620
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

30:44.344 --> 30:45.554
Excuse me.

30:47.222 --> 30:48.432
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

30:53.312 --> 30:54.980
Are you using that sugar?

30:57.357 --> 30:58.358
Help yourself.

31:03.572 --> 31:04.948
Is their salad any good?

31:07.534 --> 31:09.912
Actually, yeah. Better than I thought.

31:11.538 --> 31:12.915
Maybe I'll give it a try.

31:15.292 --> 31:19.922
It's funny. I've driven by here 100 times,
but I've never been inside one of these.

31:21.632 --> 31:24.009
They're pretty much the same all over.

31:26.303 --> 31:27.304
I like it.

31:28.972 --> 31:29.973
Thank you.

31:31.308 --> 31:34.144
-You're reading Manhattan Beach?
-Just starting it.

31:34.645 --> 31:37.397
I read it last year for my book club.
It's wonderful.

31:38.273 --> 31:41.068
I didn't love her last one,
so I was pretty skeptical.

31:41.902 --> 31:43.403
But it's very different.

31:44.238 --> 31:45.531
I'm Laurie, by the way.

31:46.865 --> 31:49.618
-Jeanine. Nice to meet you.
-You too.

32:03.298 --> 32:06.385
I'll have the same salad she ordered.
Dressing on the side.

32:06.468 --> 32:08.554
Coming up. French fries too?

32:09.596 --> 32:12.808
No, I'd better not.
They're my weakness.

32:15.060 --> 32:18.730
You can have the rest of mine if you want.
I really only wanted a few.

32:20.148 --> 32:22.317
-Are you sure?
-Absolutely.

32:34.079 --> 32:35.372
Excuse me.

32:37.916 --> 32:39.877
Would you like to...

32:42.796 --> 32:43.922
Sure.

32:55.976 --> 32:57.436
She didn't wanna stay for dinner?

32:59.354 --> 33:00.856
Her mom wanted her back home.

33:02.649 --> 33:03.859
She seemed nice.

33:04.526 --> 33:07.404
Mm-hmm. She's a little weird though.

33:09.198 --> 33:10.324
Weird?

33:11.992 --> 33:13.535
Yeah. Like artsy, you know?

33:14.912 --> 33:17.998
A lot of kids give her crap for it
sometimes.

33:18.832 --> 33:20.417
Well, it's nice she came to see you.

33:21.710 --> 33:25.797
Yeah. We were just texting,
and she asked me what I do most days,

33:25.881 --> 33:27.799
and I said, "Nothing much,"

33:27.883 --> 33:31.136
so she said she can come over, hang out.

33:35.140 --> 33:37.351
But I think she just feels sorry for me.

33:39.978 --> 33:41.647
Maybe she just likes you.

33:43.023 --> 33:46.026
I think it's more like
she feels guilty or...

33:46.109 --> 33:47.486
What do you mean, guilty?

33:48.403 --> 33:50.531
She said Derek was saying
some stuff about me to her

33:50.614 --> 33:52.407
and she just feels bad about it.

33:52.866 --> 33:54.826
For believing him, whatever.

33:56.787 --> 33:58.372
She doesn't believe him now though?

33:58.956 --> 34:01.208
I guess not, if she came over.

34:04.253 --> 34:05.879
But he's been into her forever.

34:08.047 --> 34:09.299
Who, Derek?

34:09.382 --> 34:12.052
Yeah. He's, like, obsessed with her.

34:17.766 --> 34:19.893
I think she thinks maybe he did it.

34:22.145 --> 34:25.274
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
What'd you just say?

34:27.734 --> 34:31.446
She thinks he might have done it.
But she didn't say that, you know.

34:31.530 --> 34:34.616
She just said she heard the cops
were at school and had talked to him.

34:35.449 --> 34:37.995
-They called in his mom too.
-That doesn't mean he's a suspect.

34:38.078 --> 34:41.081
I know, but that's what she thinks it was.

34:43.750 --> 34:47.504
I don't know. Maybe she just
wants to make me feel better.

34:56.429 --> 35:00.017
Me? No.
I could barely draw a stick figure.

35:01.018 --> 35:02.352
I just loved it.

35:03.020 --> 35:06.940
I swear I spent half my junior year abroad
just in the Musée d'Orsay.

35:07.858 --> 35:09.026
The Water Lilies.

35:10.861 --> 35:13.280
I know it's a total cliché
to love impressionism,

35:13.363 --> 35:18.660
but there's this...
unabashed emotionality to it

35:18.744 --> 35:20.120
that is just so...

35:21.288 --> 35:25.542
I don't know.
Brave is probably the wrong word, but...

35:26.168 --> 35:29.713
-Do you know what I mean?
-I think I do, yes.

35:30.130 --> 35:31.548
Sorry, I'm rambling.

35:31.632 --> 35:33.383
It's fine, really.

35:34.259 --> 35:37.095
It's like I saw this poster
the other day of a Bonnard...

35:46.355 --> 35:47.356
Laurie?

35:48.565 --> 35:50.275
I apologize. I--

35:55.489 --> 35:57.574
My family's been
going through a hard time.

36:00.118 --> 36:01.954
Something terrible's happened and...

36:02.913 --> 36:05.999
the friends I would usually talk to,
they aren't...

36:08.752 --> 36:10.212
Well, they've given up on us.

36:13.465 --> 36:17.970
My husband says I shouldn't care.
But he's never really had friends.

36:20.305 --> 36:21.765
Not real ones.

36:23.141 --> 36:26.812
Is that strange? I never really
thought about it until recently.

36:28.188 --> 36:31.358
I mean, he's had casual friends,
people in his life,

36:31.441 --> 36:35.070
but no one he was truly close to,
other than me.

36:37.322 --> 36:39.241
Maybe I liked that I was the only one.

36:40.742 --> 36:42.703
Although even with me, he--

36:47.082 --> 36:48.792
I'm sorry. You just--

36:49.168 --> 36:51.795
You just wanted a quiet dinner
and to read your book.

36:52.546 --> 36:53.672
Please.

36:54.798 --> 36:56.758
I understand. It's okay.

37:00.137 --> 37:03.056
You probably heard about the boy
who was killed in Newton.

37:05.434 --> 37:07.060
Well, my son, he...

37:09.313 --> 37:10.439
I know.

37:12.316 --> 37:13.400
I'm sorry.

37:13.483 --> 37:16.820
I've been trying to find a way to tell you
without making this uncomfortable.

37:16.904 --> 37:18.739
I should have said something sooner.

37:19.323 --> 37:20.490
You knew.

37:21.533 --> 37:26.288
To be honest, I was hoping to
speak with you about the case.

37:26.371 --> 37:27.956
If you'd be open to that.

37:31.502 --> 37:32.794
I am a writer.

37:33.504 --> 37:37.090
I'm doing a freelance piece
for the Globe Sunday magazine.

37:37.633 --> 37:40.719
-No.
-Laurie, I didn't mean to--

37:40.802 --> 37:42.262
I need to go.

37:44.973 --> 37:47.476
Is there anything you said
that you'd like kept off-the-record?

37:47.559 --> 37:49.311
What? I don't--

37:49.853 --> 37:51.021
Did you follow me here?

37:51.939 --> 37:53.232
Did you follow me here?

37:54.107 --> 37:56.443
Please. Just give me
a few minutes to explain.

38:28.308 --> 38:30.686
Hi. How was dinner?

38:32.062 --> 38:33.063
Good.

38:37.693 --> 38:40.404
I might have made some progress today
on the Patz front.

38:41.405 --> 38:43.824
Yeah. I talked to this kid
who's mixed up with him.

38:43.907 --> 38:45.242
I think he's hiding something.

38:48.495 --> 38:49.830
You okay?

38:52.624 --> 38:53.792
I'm just tired.

38:55.878 --> 38:59.047
Okay. I'm gonna take out this recycling.
I'll be up in a minute.

39:00.340 --> 39:01.341
Okay.

39:27.117 --> 39:28.202
Hey.

39:29.661 --> 39:32.331
Mom and I are gonna hit the hay.
You should probably do the same.

39:32.414 --> 39:34.625
All right. Good night.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.126
What are you watching?

39:37.586 --> 39:38.879
Skateboarding fails.

39:40.672 --> 39:44.134
High comedy. Okay. Don't stay up too late.

39:44.551 --> 39:45.552
Okay.

39:58.148 --> 40:01.693
Just kind of a sense of normalcy,
in a way.

40:02.528 --> 40:04.863
I mean, it's not like
he ever had girls over before,

40:04.947 --> 40:06.949
but you know what I mean.

40:08.992 --> 40:10.369
So dinner was nice?

40:11.787 --> 40:16.083
Good. Good, I'm glad. You deserve it.

41:01.712 --> 41:04.923
Hey, guys. Here's a new one
I just wrote. I hope you like it.

41:06.216 --> 41:10.345
Hold my hand

41:16.101 --> 41:18.437
I'm gonna check in again
with Duffy tomorrow.

41:19.146 --> 41:22.566
Sarah told Jacob she saw the police
at school questioning Derek.

41:23.400 --> 41:24.401
About what?

41:24.860 --> 41:29.239
I don't know. Sarah seems to think
that he might be a suspect.

41:29.323 --> 41:30.324
Derek?

41:30.908 --> 41:33.118
Yeah. Anything's possible.

41:37.998 --> 41:38.999
What?

41:40.876 --> 41:42.794
That's what everyone says about Jacob.

41:44.171 --> 41:47.716
Well, that's why we can't leave his fate
up to the cops and a courtroom.

41:47.799 --> 41:49.760
We gotta get answers for ourselves.

41:50.594 --> 41:51.970
Isn't that Joanna's job?

41:54.598 --> 41:57.226
Joanna's a great lawyer,
but lawyers have boundaries.

41:57.809 --> 41:59.561
I don't. Not anymore.

42:01.021 --> 42:03.649
My only job now
is trying to protect our son.

42:06.777 --> 42:08.111
Whatever it takes.

42:12.282 --> 42:14.826
"The parents of Ms. Rouse
remained inconsolable,

42:15.494 --> 42:18.497
even as a verdict of
life without parole was delivered.

42:18.580 --> 42:21.542
Also in court was William Barber's wife,
Marianne,

42:21.625 --> 42:25.170
and the couple's 5-year-old son, Andrew.

42:25.796 --> 42:29.883
Throughout the proceedings, the defendant
refused to display any remorse whatsoever.

42:29.967 --> 42:34.388
'If looks could kill,'
one of the jurors later commented."

42:35.514 --> 42:39.476
Must've been terrifying,
growing up with a father like that.

42:40.394 --> 42:43.772
I didn't have any contact with him.
Just once after the trial. That's it.

42:43.856 --> 42:48.318
Still. My father lost his hair in his 20s.

42:49.111 --> 42:52.865
I know I spent my teens
wondering when I was gonna lose mine.

42:56.243 --> 42:59.413
Are you telling me
you didn't grow up scared...

43:00.789 --> 43:05.335
that, deep inside,
there might be some part of him in you?

43:08.088 --> 43:13.385
Surely, it must have occurred to you
at certain pivotal moments.

43:14.887 --> 43:16.388
The arrival of a child.

43:18.557 --> 43:20.309
Watching your little boy grow.

43:22.394 --> 43:27.941
Privately obsessing over
even his most innocent behaviors.

43:29.359 --> 43:31.361
Always on the lookout for any indication

43:31.445 --> 43:34.990
that your father's blood
might run in his veins.

43:36.909 --> 43:39.620
Then, lo and behold,
he's implicated in a violent crime.

43:40.120 --> 43:42.039
Stabbing, no less.

43:43.415 --> 43:46.168
Your worst fears finally realized.

43:50.464 --> 43:52.090
No, it's just the opposite.

43:54.134 --> 43:56.470
When you live with what I've lived with
for so long...

43:58.514 --> 44:01.600
you look at your kid through that lens
1000 times.

44:01.683 --> 44:03.352
You've made your determination.

44:08.232 --> 44:11.235
I knew Jacob wasn't a murderer
the way I knew I wasn't.

44:13.153 --> 44:14.613
If you say so.

44:16.323 --> 44:18.700
But you had 14 years
to come to that conclusion.

44:20.410 --> 44:22.246
Laurie, on the other hand...

44:23.580 --> 44:25.666
Laurie was a different story, wasn't she?

44:28.627 --> 44:31.880
Okay, buddy. This won't take too long,
but just try to stay still, all right?

44:32.965 --> 44:37.052
Is it okay if I'm nervous? Will I, like--
Will they see it in my brain?

44:38.262 --> 44:40.597
It's totally fine.
We can't read your thoughts.

44:42.307 --> 44:43.475
Just relax, okay?

44:47.855 --> 44:52.484
So this will take about half an hour,
so why don't we just wait in my office?

44:57.364 --> 45:00.868
So, we should probably discuss
the DNA test.

45:00.951 --> 45:03.120
I've already gotten what I need
from Jacob.

45:03.203 --> 45:05.956
Andy,
I'm gonna need a sample from you as well.

45:06.623 --> 45:08.375
You're testing for the murder gene?

45:08.458 --> 45:09.668
It's not as simple as that.

45:09.751 --> 45:12.754
And that's just a coy phrase
used to grab some headlines.

45:12.838 --> 45:13.964
That said,

45:14.047 --> 45:17.634
I think Joanna was wise to have you
pursue these results, just in case.

45:18.343 --> 45:19.511
I don't understand.

45:19.595 --> 45:23.724
Well, if Jacob is found guilty,
and I'm saying if,

45:24.349 --> 45:28.061
then you may wanna present
genetic evidence as mitigation.

45:28.562 --> 45:29.855
Mitigation?

45:30.606 --> 45:33.192
-To get it reduced to second. Right?
-Correct.

45:33.275 --> 45:35.277
First degree murder is
mandatory life without parole.

45:35.360 --> 45:38.030
Second degree,
he becomes eligible in 20 years.

45:38.113 --> 45:40.532
He'd only be 35.
He'd have his whole life in front of him.

45:41.658 --> 45:45.829
-Yeah, what's left of it.
-Again, if. Only if.

46:02.054 --> 46:05.974
So, we should probably
talk about your father.

46:07.100 --> 46:08.101
What about him?

46:08.185 --> 46:10.938
Well, obviously, I'm gonna need
a swab from him as well.

46:11.438 --> 46:14.650
Go ahead. He's in Northern Prison
in Somers, Connecticut.

46:14.733 --> 46:17.027
I know. I tried to visit him there.

46:18.070 --> 46:21.949
-You did?
-I did. And there's an issue.

46:22.950 --> 46:26.453
-What kind of issue?
-He wouldn't agree to the test.

46:26.912 --> 46:28.205
What do you mean?

46:29.164 --> 46:31.166
He says you have to ask.

46:32.125 --> 46:33.126
Me?

46:34.294 --> 46:37.256
-He doesn't know me.
-Apparently he wants to change that.

46:41.218 --> 46:42.344
You gotta be kidding.

46:42.427 --> 46:44.763
Andy, I'm sorry,
but we need his cooperation to--

46:44.847 --> 46:46.348
Tell him he can fuck off.

46:54.064 --> 46:55.065
Sorry.

46:59.987 --> 47:01.905
I don't think I can do that. I can't.

47:01.989 --> 47:03.073
You can.

47:05.909 --> 47:06.910
He'll go.

47:08.954 --> 47:10.414
You'll do it for Jacob.

47:12.624 --> 47:14.835
It's like you said. Whatever it takes.
