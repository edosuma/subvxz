00:14.200 --> 00:15.480
Da-da-da-da-da! Dig Champs!

00:15.480 --> 00:19.680
Dude

00:19.780 --> 00:20.600
These are probably the best
graphics I've ever seen in my life!

00:20.600 --> 00:22.570
Dude

00:28.200 --> 00:29.400
It looks just like the cover!

00:30.250 --> 00:32.290
Dude, let's play it.

00:36.155 --> 00:37.975
We should stretch it out first.

00:37.975 --> 00:41.145
We don't want to pull our "hammies,"
know what I'm sayin'?

00:41.655 --> 00:43.015
Hey, whatta ya doin'?!

00:43.015 --> 00:43.965
Starting.

00:43.965 --> 00:46.445
Hurry up, and, pick your character!

00:46.705 --> 00:47.575
Aw, what?!

00:47.655 --> 00:49.085
I wanted to be player one!

00:49.155 --> 00:49.765
Dude

00:49.765 --> 00:50.825
I'm player one.

00:50.825 --> 00:52.105
You're player two.

00:52.105 --> 00:53.295
I don't wanna be player two!

00:53.295 --> 00:54.995
He digs with a sucky pickaxe!

00:54.995 --> 00:56.425
I want the one with the shovel!

00:56.495 --> 00:57.955
Dude, they're exactly the same!

00:57.955 --> 00:59.745
Then why don't you be player two?!

01:00.345 --> 01:01.995
I'm not using that sucky pickaxe!

01:02.285 --> 01:03.275
See?!

01:03.275 --> 01:04.885
Dude, calm down!

01:04.915 --> 01:07.345
Let's play Punchies to see
who gets to be player one.

01:07.505 --> 01:08.415
Fine!

01:12.395 --> 01:14.055
Looks like I'm player one.

01:14.155 --> 01:14.895
No!

01:14.925 --> 01:15.975
It's not fair!

01:15.975 --> 01:17.425
You always get your way!

01:17.425 --> 01:19.885
Let's play Punchies, let's play Punchies.

01:19.885 --> 01:20.805
I'm sick of it!

01:20.805 --> 01:22.725
Of course I'm not gonna
beat you at punchies!

01:22.795 --> 01:25.385
Dude, you don't beat
anybody at punchies.

01:25.385 --> 01:26.185
Yes I do!

01:26.185 --> 01:27.245
No you don't.

01:38.075 --> 01:38.965
Quick, doctor,

01:38.965 --> 01:40.985
both of these butt cheeks are unrecognizable.

01:41.045 --> 01:43.725
If we want anyone to be able
to recognize this as a butt in the future,

01:43.805 --> 01:46.255
then we're gonna have to do a complete butt transplant, stat!

01:46.385 --> 01:48.055
Stop talking!

01:48.055 --> 01:50.515
There was only damage to
the one cheek and you know it!

01:52.175 --> 01:53.015
That's right!

01:53.015 --> 01:55.015
We used to call you
the One- Cheek Wonder!

01:55.015 --> 01:56.525
Dude, I'm bringin' it back.

01:56.525 --> 01:57.545
You better not!

01:57.545 --> 01:59.845
Is that One- Cheek wonder?

01:59.845 --> 02:01.745
I hope he's not trying to play

02:01.745 --> 02:04.165
Punchies with cheeks like that!

02:04.965 --> 02:05.725
Stop!

02:05.725 --> 02:06.705
Don't look at them!

02:06.705 --> 02:07.785
I'll win at punchies,

02:07.785 --> 02:08.705
you'll see!

02:12.685 --> 02:14.025
Dumb Mordecai!

02:14.025 --> 02:15.275
I hate you!

02:15.345 --> 02:17.835
You better not be messin'
up my side of the room!

02:20.335 --> 02:21.745
You're ruining my life!!!

02:30.545 --> 02:31.875
Stupid bo-

02:32.285 --> 02:32.745
-ok?

02:33.235 --> 02:34.995
Death Kwon Do?

02:36.055 --> 02:39.605
"Learn kicks, chops and punches in moments."

02:39.705 --> 02:42.165
"Unlock your full potential today"?

02:43.035 --> 02:45.155
Yes!

02:47.285 --> 02:48.885
It's a touching story.

02:49.155 --> 02:50.075
Really, it is.

02:50.275 --> 02:51.755
But I don't know if you're ready

02:51.755 --> 02:53.035
for Death Kwon Do.

02:53.315 --> 02:54.235
Why not?!

02:54.415 --> 02:57.305
Death Kwon Do is all about self defense.

02:57.485 --> 02:58.645
But from the sound of it,

02:58.645 --> 03:00.125
you just want to hit harder.

03:01.045 --> 03:01.705
No?

03:01.985 --> 03:03.345
Can you just teach me something?

03:04.505 --> 03:05.645
Determination.

03:05.855 --> 03:06.595
I like that.

03:06.875 --> 03:10.135
Okay, I'll teach you some beginner defensive moves.

03:10.435 --> 03:11.485
All you gotta do is

03:11.485 --> 03:13.655
pick from the sacred text

03:13.655 --> 03:15.625
of Death Kwon Do

03:17.145 --> 03:18.345
Let's see, we can start you off

03:18.345 --> 03:20.345
with "Bicep Flex of Death."

03:21.635 --> 03:23.685
Or there's the "Leg Lifts of Death."

03:23.685 --> 03:25.145
That's a good beginner's move.

03:25.145 --> 03:27.215
Or the "Pelvic Thrust of Death."

03:27.215 --> 03:29.345
That's one of my personal favorites.

03:29.805 --> 03:30.615
That one.

03:30.675 --> 03:31.775
That's the one I want.

03:31.895 --> 03:33.555
"The Death Punch."

03:36.435 --> 03:39.415
That I'm afraid is not for beginners.

03:39.425 --> 03:40.745
What, why?

03:40.775 --> 03:43.585
Because you only want to
use it to beat up your friends.

03:43.585 --> 03:45.235
You're not pure of heart!

03:45.285 --> 03:45.925
What?!

03:46.055 --> 03:47.815
Don't call me not pure of heart!

03:47.885 --> 03:49.655
What about you with your crappy mullet?!

03:49.655 --> 03:51.085
You're the one who's not pure of heart!

03:51.085 --> 03:52.035
That's it!

03:52.155 --> 03:55.155
I'm turning my back on
you and counting to three!

03:55.285 --> 03:56.205
Of death.

03:56.455 --> 03:58.255
And when I turn back around

03:58.255 --> 03:59.715
you're toast!

03:59.895 --> 04:00.705
One

04:00.835 --> 04:01.705
Of death.

04:01.865 --> 04:02.775
Two

04:02.935 --> 04:04.385
Of death.

04:07.025 --> 04:11.225
No!

04:11.395 --> 04:12.115
Sensei,

04:13.345 --> 04:15.975
I think somebody just
death kwon clogged the toilet.

04:16.105 --> 04:21.055
No!

04:55.005 --> 04:56.715
Time to take this baby for a

test drive.

05:07.535 --> 05:08.945
Oh no,

05:09.145 --> 05:10.145
Bro!

05:27.825 --> 05:30.465
You're next, Mordecai!!

05:35.575 --> 05:36.425
All right, Rigby.

05:36.525 --> 05:37.795
Cry baby time's over.

05:37.795 --> 05:39.035
Come on, let's go get some food.

05:39.035 --> 05:39.715
I'm buying.

05:40.465 --> 05:41.235
What?

05:41.825 --> 05:42.845
Rigby!

05:44.535 --> 05:46.225
He's gonna pay for this.

05:47.375 --> 05:49.415
Death Kwon Do?

05:49.625 --> 05:51.415
Where are you, Mordecai?

05:51.485 --> 05:53.665
I wanna play you punchies!

05:54.435 --> 05:55.195
Hey, mister,

05:55.195 --> 05:56.375
have you seen Mordecai?

05:56.785 --> 05:57.225
No.

05:57.345 --> 05:58.345
Who's..

05:58.725 --> 05:59.785
Have you seen 'im?

05:59.785 --> 06:00.415
Seen..

06:01.515 --> 06:02.415
How 'bout you?

06:05.515 --> 06:07.705
so you think you're gonna
beat me at punchies?

06:07.765 --> 06:09.345
Well, I've got news for you.

06:09.575 --> 06:11.515
I know your little secret.

06:27.415 --> 06:28.975
Now massage this foot!

06:29.065 --> 06:30.995
But I already did that one.

06:31.275 --> 06:32.295
Then rub it again!

06:32.295 --> 06:34.005
Unless you want to get punched again!

06:34.425 --> 06:35.335
And Pops,

06:35.335 --> 06:36.625
what's with the easy-breezy?

06:36.625 --> 06:37.485
Speed it up!

06:37.485 --> 06:40.075
My pepperonis are roasting down here!

06:41.355 --> 06:42.095
Muscle Man,

06:42.095 --> 06:43.635
you see Mordecai yet?

06:44.805 --> 06:46.705
I can't see anything.

06:46.725 --> 06:48.705
I'm right here, Rigby!

06:48.995 --> 06:50.025
Gimme those!

06:53.935 --> 06:56.575
Looks like you've learned the
ways of Death Kwon Do.

06:56.645 --> 06:59.985
Looks like you know how to say
things people are already aware of.

06:59.985 --> 07:00.675
Whatever!

07:00.675 --> 07:02.675
You can't handle The Death Punch!

07:02.945 --> 07:05.025
That sounds like a challenge.

07:05.165 --> 07:07.605
That's because maybe it IS a challenge!

07:07.705 --> 07:09.695
Well then what're you doing up there?

07:09.795 --> 07:11.465
Muscle Man, High Fives,

07:11.745 --> 07:13.075
Carry me down.

07:14.895 --> 07:15.865
Don't drop me!

07:16.205 --> 07:17.265
Be careful!

07:19.085 --> 07:20.395
Leaning, leaning!

07:20.475 --> 07:21.445
Here, here!

07:21.495 --> 07:22.495
Set me here.

07:26.915 --> 07:28.485
What move did you learn?

07:28.945 --> 07:31.005
Why don't you come over
here and find out.

07:41.455 --> 07:42.015
What?!

07:44.805 --> 07:46.695
How come you're not dead yet?

07:46.905 --> 07:48.505
Probably because I learned

07:48.565 --> 07:50.735
"The Death Block."

07:52.785 --> 07:54.505
It worked pretty good for a first try,

07:54.775 --> 07:57.305
either that or your Death Punch totally blows!

07:57.305 --> 07:58.465
I'll kill you!!

08:01.475 --> 08:03.475
You're never gonna beat me at punchies!

08:17.145 --> 08:18.575
Are you finished yet?

08:18.645 --> 08:20.335
Not until I smash you!!

08:25.125 --> 08:25.665
What?

08:25.665 --> 08:27.175
Are you afraid of a little lava?

08:29.545 --> 08:31.155
Dude, this is serious!

08:31.205 --> 08:32.434
We've gotta get out of here!

08:32.434 --> 08:33.184
Never!

08:33.184 --> 08:35.184
Not until I beat you at punchies!

08:37.345 --> 08:38.405
Dude, stop!

08:38.405 --> 08:39.585
We're gonna die!

08:39.635 --> 08:40.705
I don't care!

08:40.705 --> 08:42.515
I'm sick of you always winning!

08:59.705 --> 09:02.725
I'm not quitting 'till I win!

09:12.325 --> 09:13.935
You got me, you got me!

09:14.585 --> 09:15.145
You got me.

09:15.145 --> 09:15.805
You win!

09:15.805 --> 09:17.705
We have to stop now 'cause I lost.

09:18.495 --> 09:20.565
I told ya I was gonna win!

09:20.565 --> 09:21.645
In yo face!

09:22.655 --> 09:25.015
I finally get to be player one!

09:25.115 --> 09:25.855
What?!

09:25.885 --> 09:27.235
That's what this is about?!

09:27.325 --> 09:29.385
You just wanted to be player one?!

09:29.825 --> 09:32.385
That's all I ever wanted!

09:32.435 --> 09:34.605
Dude, you can totally be player one.

09:36.125 --> 09:37.545
Dude, quit crying.

09:37.545 --> 09:39.135
I said you could be player one.

09:39.145 --> 09:40.065
I know,

09:40.065 --> 09:42.825
but what good is being player one now?

09:43.025 --> 09:46.665
We're just gonna die in this lava!!

09:46.835 --> 09:47.945
Don't worry, dude.

09:47.945 --> 09:49.915
I can get us away from the lava.

09:50.325 --> 09:51.335
Really?

09:51.395 --> 09:52.245
How?

09:52.285 --> 09:55.355
You think I'm dumb enough to
steal only one Death Kwon Do move?

09:55.455 --> 09:55.945
Wha-?

09:55.955 --> 09:57.705
Now, how do you wanna get outta here?

09:57.785 --> 09:58.915
"The Death Jump"

09:59.045 --> 10:00.355
or "The Death Dump"?

10:01.455 --> 10:02.295
Sick!!

10:02.705 --> 10:04.065
Better go with the Death Jump.

10:04.265 --> 10:05.355
Hold on tight.

10:11.425 --> 10:12.405
Look!

10:16.775 --> 10:17.765
Why yes sir,

10:17.795 --> 10:19.175
I have the Death Jump

10:19.175 --> 10:21.325
and the Death Dump right he-

10:22.095 --> 10:24.855
No!

10:27.545 --> 10:28.305
Dig Champs!

10:29.775 --> 10:31.745
It's finally happening!

10:32.325 --> 10:35.065
For once being a huge baby
actually worked out for you!

10:35.065 --> 10:36.425
Stop talking!!!

10:37.115 --> 10:38.775
Dude, just hurry up and play.

10:38.845 --> 10:41.235
You're just gonna die right
at the beginning anyway.

10:43.735 --> 10:44.685
I'll show you!

10:49.675 --> 10:50.465
What?!

10:50.675 --> 10:51.745
Snails are bad?!

10:51.745 --> 10:53.085
I thought snails were good!

10:53.235 --> 10:53.945
No, dude.

10:53.995 --> 10:55.155
Snails are bad.

10:56.375 --> 10:57.525
This sucks!

10:58.125 --> 10:59.425
I wanna be player two.
