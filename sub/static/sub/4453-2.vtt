00:43.607 --> 00:46.443
Bohannon! Bohannon!

00:52.783 --> 00:54.118
I'm all right.

00:55.202 --> 00:57.538
Okay. All right, let's
clean up that mess.

01:09.967 --> 01:11.135
You.

01:14.555 --> 01:15.681
Stay.

01:18.100 --> 01:19.393
Stay put.

01:49.923 --> 01:53.010
Right here.

01:58.223 --> 01:59.350
All right.

02:00.309 --> 02:01.769
Tie it off.

02:01.894 --> 02:04.438
All right? Like this.

02:08.692 --> 02:09.985
No need.

02:10.693 --> 02:12.446
- No help.
- Tie it off!

02:12.571 --> 02:13.697
Right now!

02:16.367 --> 02:18.577
Told you to stay in the damn tent.

02:22.206 --> 02:25.167
You lied. You ain't a soldier.

02:27.503 --> 02:29.004
<i>You</i> ain't <i>Si Bing!</i>

02:30.214 --> 02:31.799
Fong Si Bing.

02:32.341 --> 02:34.927
Nah. Soldiers don't lie.

02:38.055 --> 02:41.058
Soldier doesn't put their men in danger.

02:41.183 --> 02:43.394
A soldier follows orders!

02:45.187 --> 02:47.481
Now tie the damn rope around your waist!

03:07.751 --> 03:10.629
Yeah. Pull it tight.

03:12.005 --> 03:15.008
I do job. Good job.

03:15.134 --> 03:17.678
Si Bing for railroad.

03:30.023 --> 03:31.567
Slow.

03:33.610 --> 03:35.070
Real slow.

04:33.170 --> 04:34.338
Hang on.

04:42.513 --> 04:44.348
I'm gonna pull you up!

06:14.104 --> 06:16.690
Ain't no way,
or I'd have done it.

06:26.783 --> 06:27.826
Boiler needs flushing.

06:27.951 --> 06:28.994
Boiler's fine.

06:32.247 --> 06:33.498
Smoke box?

06:33.624 --> 06:35.208
Practically new.

06:35.334 --> 06:37.085
- Bearings?
- Swiss watch.

06:38.170 --> 06:40.090
When's the last time
you replaced them pistons?

06:42.299 --> 06:44.619
It's gonna take a magician
to get her up there, Bohannon.

06:45.552 --> 06:47.846
Well, I ain't no magician.

06:47.971 --> 06:51.016
Trust me when I say it can't be done.

06:54.144 --> 06:55.812
Once the snow melts, you mean.

06:57.689 --> 06:58.690
" How?"

07:00.651 --> 07:01.651
Sled.

07:02.027 --> 07:03.307
You're gonna have to build it.

07:04.321 --> 07:06.758
Chinamen built the Great Wall,
reckon they can build me a sled.

07:06.782 --> 07:10.494
You're gonna need a Chinaman translator,
and yours ain't showed up for work today.

07:11.787 --> 07:14.498
- I'll talk slow.
- For what, Bohannon?

07:14.957 --> 07:17.209
Couple six inches more a day
than what we're cutting now?

07:17.876 --> 07:20.963
This race is gonna come down to inches,
not miles, Mr. Strobridge.

07:21.838 --> 07:23.507
Couple six inches a day is everything.

07:23.632 --> 07:26.176
That's what my wife keeps telling me.

07:29.012 --> 07:30.055
Wrong pipe.

07:30.973 --> 07:31.974
She tell you that, too?

07:35.352 --> 07:37.562
Mr. Bohannon
has proposed to mechanize

07:37.688 --> 07:40.232
the removal of the rock
from the tunnel shaft

07:40.357 --> 07:42.835
and double our shifts to work
through the night. Now that means

07:42.859 --> 07:46.488
I have to take my Chinamen
off of the snow removal detail

07:47.239 --> 07:50.367
east of the tunnel
to work in the hole.

07:50.492 --> 07:53.829
Well, if Mr. Bohannon's idea works,

07:54.579 --> 07:58.041
well, we'll punch through
before the first day of spring.

08:00.043 --> 08:01.336
I need that snow gone.

08:01.837 --> 08:03.547
I need your men to pick up the slack.

08:04.172 --> 08:05.924
Shoveling snow is Chinamen's work.

08:07.926 --> 08:10.220
Eight hundred men
free from the sin of sloth.

08:11.304 --> 08:12.931
Your father's words to me.

08:14.516 --> 08:16.268
Words I paid a pretty penny for.

08:17.394 --> 08:19.771
That was the deal,
wasn't it, Mr. Gundersen?

08:20.772 --> 08:23.150
A devil's bargain, no doubt.

08:24.568 --> 08:25.819
Is there a problem?

08:27.779 --> 08:29.406
I can throw up a wire right now,

08:30.157 --> 08:31.533
bring your father in on this,

08:32.034 --> 08:34.453
let him know the decreasing value
of his word?

08:38.457 --> 08:39.457
No?

08:40.417 --> 08:41.710
Then that'll be all, sir.

08:49.217 --> 08:51.344
Best bring a coat with you,
Mr. Gundersen.

08:53.638 --> 08:55.807
It is bitter cold
up in them mountains.

10:46.042 --> 10:47.043
Fong.

10:55.218 --> 10:56.428
Bohannon.

11:17.073 --> 11:18.408
Excuse me.

11:19.868 --> 11:21.369
I need a foreman that speaks English.

11:21.828 --> 11:22.913
Today.

11:25.040 --> 11:28.376
What befell Tao is regrettable,
Mr. Bohannon.

11:28.501 --> 11:32.214
More so given he's the only one
who speaks English well enough.

11:32.339 --> 11:33.715
You speak it well enough.

11:41.932 --> 11:44.434
A shame I am not a railroad worker.

11:46.061 --> 11:49.189
At 19, I was preparing food
for the Qing Emperor.

11:50.065 --> 11:52.901
I spent months crafting the perfect recipe,

11:53.026 --> 11:55.820
only to see him spit out his first bite

11:55.946 --> 11:57.864
and toss me from the palace grounds.

12:01.326 --> 12:04.412
The sweet bean glaze had soured over.

12:06.039 --> 12:10.460
One wrong ingredient
can spoil all your hard work, like that.

12:22.264 --> 12:24.057
Next time you want to send a message,

12:26.184 --> 12:29.646
you send it to me direct, son.

12:42.617 --> 12:45.328
The job is to dismantle
this here locomotive.

12:45.453 --> 12:46.663
Take it apart.

12:46.788 --> 12:48.498
Any little piece that can come off...

12:51.418 --> 12:52.502
comes off.

12:53.003 --> 12:54.212
Truck's gotta come off.

12:54.629 --> 12:56.298
Same thing with these here wheels. Off.

12:57.716 --> 13:00.552
Piston rods, connecting rods,
brake cylinders, buffer beams,

13:00.677 --> 13:02.304
all of it gotta come off.

13:04.055 --> 13:05.181
Get back to work, John.

13:06.308 --> 13:07.708
Now once we get her picked apart,

13:08.143 --> 13:09.787
we'll use the trucking jacks,
load her onto the sled,

13:09.811 --> 13:11.491
take her up the mountain.
Y'all understand?

13:14.232 --> 13:15.317
You understand?

13:15.900 --> 13:17.027
Hoi understand.

13:17.652 --> 13:18.820
All right, good. Tell them.

13:22.699 --> 13:23.992
Tell them.

13:28.997 --> 13:30.165
What I just...

13:31.082 --> 13:32.082
Shit.

13:32.167 --> 13:34.836
Take engine apart.

13:35.670 --> 13:38.006
Every single piece.

13:41.176 --> 13:42.260
Break...

13:42.385 --> 13:45.388
Break it down.
Every, every single piece, apart.

13:48.600 --> 13:50.727
Any damn one of y'all
understand a word I'm saying?

13:52.562 --> 13:55.065
Yeah? Well, if you do,
let me hear you say it! Tell 'em.

14:17.295 --> 14:19.798
- What in the hell did you tell them?
- I say take apart.

14:21.216 --> 14:24.344
- You stealing my Chinamen now, Bohannon?
- Hey!

14:25.095 --> 14:26.096
Need him.

14:26.221 --> 14:27.639
- What for?
- Translator.

14:29.391 --> 14:31.309
Hell.

14:31.434 --> 14:32.435
You.

14:33.686 --> 14:35.647
You! Come with me, John.

14:38.525 --> 14:39.943
Noble little engine,

14:40.068 --> 14:42.237
the first locomotive
to run on California soil.

14:42.821 --> 14:45.490
Christened by Ted Judah
and his wife, 1855.

14:47.700 --> 14:49.619
I was gonna put it
in my museum one day.

14:51.913 --> 14:53.206
This here will have to do.

14:54.833 --> 14:56.292
Let's get it done, son. Come on.

15:36.833 --> 15:39.711
It ain't so bad, is it?
Tell me it ain't so bad!

15:39.836 --> 15:40.837
Shh.

15:42.005 --> 15:45.508
Can... can you wiggle your toes?

15:51.723 --> 15:52.849
No?

15:53.558 --> 15:56.352
This one. Little bit?!

16:04.986 --> 16:07.614
- My Lord.
- Get back to work.

16:08.656 --> 16:11.701
We're not working until we're
provided for, Brother Phineas.

16:13.036 --> 16:14.579
Faith provides.

16:17.373 --> 16:18.541
Now get back to work.

16:20.168 --> 16:23.713
Faith doesn't put food in our bellies,

16:23.838 --> 16:25.298
or clothes on our backs,

16:26.966 --> 16:28.134
or boots on our feet.

16:31.304 --> 16:34.516
Perhaps a telegram to Zion

16:36.476 --> 16:38.478
to ask for supplies?

16:40.313 --> 16:42.649
Yes. Yes.

16:44.859 --> 16:46.861
I will, I will message my father

16:46.986 --> 16:49.322
and I will impress upon Brother Brigham

16:49.906 --> 16:51.407
the urgency of our situation.

16:54.369 --> 16:55.411
You have my word.

17:15.598 --> 17:17.934
Turn them horses away from the treeline!

17:23.397 --> 17:25.191
Get them away from the treeline!

17:29.821 --> 17:31.948
No! Away from the trees!

17:32.490 --> 17:33.575
Away!

17:33.700 --> 17:35.159
Away from the trees!

17:43.042 --> 17:44.042
Brake that sled!

17:57.640 --> 17:58.683
Whoa, whoa!

18:07.525 --> 18:08.818
Brake that sled! Come on!

18:23.166 --> 18:26.586
Damn it.
I said away from the treeline!

18:27.462 --> 18:29.964
You speak English or what?

18:42.310 --> 18:45.021
- Fix?
- No, it's busted.

18:47.398 --> 18:50.151
No, no fix. No, no brake.

18:56.741 --> 19:00.286
- Brake.
- No. Chains ain't gonna help, Fong.

19:01.537 --> 19:04.749
Tell 'em to take everything off. Get
what they can down to where the horses are.

19:05.166 --> 19:07.710
I'll go back into Truckee,
get what I need to fix this brake.

19:25.186 --> 19:27.146
Hey! I said take everything off.

19:27.897 --> 19:29.148
No fix.

19:29.273 --> 19:30.650
Take apart. Tell them.

19:41.160 --> 19:44.163
You, you. Give me a hand.

20:12.817 --> 20:13.985
Fix brake.

20:14.944 --> 20:16.863
Yeah, we'll see.

20:57.945 --> 20:59.071
Fix brake.

21:02.158 --> 21:03.826
Yeah, fix brake.

21:35.024 --> 21:36.025
Mocha?

21:40.696 --> 21:42.865
Mocha?

21:45.743 --> 21:46.911
Mocha.

21:50.957 --> 21:53.376
It's good.

21:57.713 --> 22:00.550
Damn, son.
You sure can take a beating.

22:02.677 --> 22:04.178
I said you're tough.

22:06.222 --> 22:08.140
You know tough? Well...

22:10.560 --> 22:12.728
Tough? Fight?

22:14.146 --> 22:15.565
You fight?

22:17.316 --> 22:18.651
In the war?

22:19.068 --> 22:20.319
You a soldier?

22:20.987 --> 22:22.405
<i>Si Bing.</i>

22:23.573 --> 22:25.867
Si Bing. Soldier?

22:27.493 --> 22:31.497
Yes. I fight, yes.

22:34.166 --> 22:36.711
<i>Um. You Si Bing?</i>

22:40.590 --> 22:41.841
Yeah.

22:43.092 --> 22:46.429
Yeah, me Si Bing. Yeah.

23:00.776 --> 23:02.153
Go on, take it.

23:04.447 --> 23:06.115
It's American mocha.

23:14.248 --> 23:17.877
Shit kicks like a mule.
But it'll burn that pain out.

23:26.802 --> 23:28.304
Give it a sec.

23:41.525 --> 23:43.819
I was gonna build me a house.

23:46.197 --> 23:51.661
Two stories, fireplace, porch.

23:52.912 --> 23:55.414
The kind that wraps around.

23:59.543 --> 24:02.505
Place I could kick my boots off.
Sit a spell.

24:06.509 --> 24:08.511
Frame it out of something sturdy.

24:10.179 --> 24:11.514
Spruce, maybe.

24:16.852 --> 24:18.813
Something with integrity.

24:21.983 --> 24:23.818
Something that would last.

24:38.207 --> 24:41.043
My house gone.

24:43.546 --> 24:45.381
Village gone.

24:46.924 --> 24:50.720
Family, all gone.

24:53.180 --> 24:54.181
Yeah.

25:18.247 --> 25:20.166
Do you like a little more?

25:20.291 --> 25:23.127
You're a good boy.

25:30.760 --> 25:33.220
No supplies until spring.

25:35.347 --> 25:36.974
I made a promise.

25:41.437 --> 25:42.438
Damn him.

25:42.897 --> 25:45.316
You must not speak this way
about the Prophet.

25:45.441 --> 25:47.401
Why?

25:48.652 --> 25:52.073
I'm his disappointment, and he's cast me
off to the cold hell of this mountain.

25:52.198 --> 25:55.117
It is not the Prophet who tests you,
Brother Phineas,

25:55.993 --> 25:57.328
but Heavenly Father.

25:57.995 --> 26:02.833
As fire tests and purifies gold.

26:02.958 --> 26:06.837
You will bring much praise and glory
upon your return to Zion.

26:06.962 --> 26:09.965
This I know.

26:10.549 --> 26:13.469
You're kind to me, Brother Thor.

26:15.805 --> 26:20.351
But kindnesses will not clad my men's feet,
nor put food on their table.

26:20.476 --> 26:23.854
No. This is what faith is for.

26:24.980 --> 26:30.945
And we must practice it
with open hearts,

26:31.987 --> 26:33.531
not bitter ones.

26:40.162 --> 26:41.372
Come and sit.

26:41.497 --> 26:44.291
Share, share in the fire with me.

26:44.416 --> 26:46.919
And Oslo.

27:50.482 --> 27:54.486
Would it be terrible inappropriate
if I put my arm around you right now?

27:55.362 --> 27:57.156
Fong, get your ass out here!

28:02.203 --> 28:05.164
Come on, hop to it!

28:12.129 --> 28:13.714
Jesus.

28:13.839 --> 28:14.965
Here, lay down.

28:15.090 --> 28:17.635
No help. Fong good. Good.

28:17.760 --> 28:20.054
No, you ain't.
Come on. Lie down.

28:20.179 --> 28:22.014
- No! No...
- There ain't no shame in it, son.

28:22.139 --> 28:23.139
Let me have a look.

28:23.599 --> 28:26.727
Damn it! You need to be looked to
and ain't a damn doctor out here.

28:28.938 --> 28:30.064
Now hold still.

28:32.858 --> 28:36.278
These bandages is all wrong.

28:36.612 --> 28:38.948
Damn it. Hold still.

28:39.615 --> 28:41.700
I'm just gonna redo these dressings.

28:51.961 --> 28:54.880
Bohannon!
What's going on in there?

29:00.094 --> 29:02.638
Please don't say about this.
They kill me.

29:02.763 --> 29:05.599
- Ain't getting any younger, Bohannon.
- Please.

29:12.856 --> 29:14.149
Please?

29:17.945 --> 29:20.489
You stay in the tent.
You hear me?

29:22.783 --> 29:24.368
Stay in the damn tent.

29:24.493 --> 29:25.995
The hell's the hold up?

29:26.662 --> 29:27.662
Sick list.

29:27.705 --> 29:29.865
Why don't you check him for ticks
while you're at it?

29:41.385 --> 29:43.721
I was wearing a pairjust like that

29:43.846 --> 29:46.682
when a ship bound for California

29:46.807 --> 29:49.310
left me stranded in the jungles of Panama.

29:50.227 --> 29:53.022
Traversed the stinking mud,
torrential rain,

29:53.147 --> 29:57.401
all the while met by alligators, snakes,
poisonous lizards, worms.

29:57.526 --> 29:59.820
Well, I tell you, sir.

30:00.654 --> 30:04.366
Death carried off 10 men a day.
Yeah...

30:05.367 --> 30:07.870
And it wasn't the crocodilians
that took them first.

30:07.995 --> 30:09.621
You know what it was, sir?

30:09.747 --> 30:12.916
- No, sir. What was it?
- Wet feet.

30:14.793 --> 30:15.794
Wet feet.

30:18.339 --> 30:22.051
But for 39 miles, 60 days, my feet?
Dry.

30:22.176 --> 30:25.763
I can have 300 pairs like that
to you and your saints by week's end.

30:27.097 --> 30:28.891
Well, you appear unconvinced.

30:29.016 --> 30:33.145
Wealthy in spirit will not send me home
with these boots, alas.

30:33.270 --> 30:36.482
$5 a pair.
That lift your spirits?

30:38.233 --> 30:40.235
Give me two months' work,
free labor on the grade,

30:40.361 --> 30:41.921
boots are yours today.
How's that sound?

30:42.029 --> 30:46.867
A price higher than the peaks
Mr. Bohannon has condemned us to shoveling.

30:46.992 --> 30:48.369
Four weeks, not a day less.

30:49.036 --> 30:50.621
- Two.
- Three.

30:56.251 --> 30:58.045
Throw in this,

30:58.921 --> 31:02.216
fine American instrument and...

31:02.966 --> 31:06.637
and you've got yourself a deal,
Mr. Huntington.

31:13.602 --> 31:16.480
Well done.

31:35.624 --> 31:36.625
Any more slack?

31:55.894 --> 31:56.895
All right.

32:37.186 --> 32:40.397
Stop!

34:05.357 --> 34:06.441
Right here.

34:11.446 --> 34:12.447
All right.

34:13.739 --> 34:15.784
Tie it off. All right?

34:16.368 --> 34:17.661
Like this.

34:18.328 --> 34:19.371
No help.

34:19.496 --> 34:21.623
Tie it off! Right now!

34:22.040 --> 34:23.667
Told you to stay in the damn tent.

34:27.795 --> 34:30.465
You lied. You ain't a soldier.

34:31.632 --> 34:32.926
<i>You</i> ain't <i>Si Bing.</i>

34:33.844 --> 34:35.304
Fong Si Bing.

34:37.514 --> 34:38.514
Soldiers don't lie.

34:42.060 --> 34:43.812
Soldier doesn't put their men in danger.

34:44.521 --> 34:46.523
A soldier follows orders!

34:48.650 --> 34:51.027
Now tie the damn rope around your waist!

35:14.301 --> 35:19.348
I do job. Good job.
Si Bing for railroad.

35:30.025 --> 35:31.026
Slow.

35:33.654 --> 35:34.988
Real slow.

36:31.128 --> 36:32.295
Hang on!

36:40.137 --> 36:41.638
I'm gonna pull you up.

37:31.229 --> 37:33.356
Couple six inches, he says.

37:34.065 --> 37:36.902
Built the Great Wall, he says.
She damaged?

37:37.319 --> 37:39.821
Took it better than you.

37:41.490 --> 37:43.909
Get her to the...
get her to the tunnel for me.

37:44.034 --> 37:45.452
- Get it there yourself.
- Can't.

37:45.577 --> 37:47.204
- Where you going?
- To find my worker.

37:47.329 --> 37:49.247
- No, no, no, you can't.
- I got to.

37:49.372 --> 37:52.918
I'm not gonna stand by and watch you
risk yourself for some slanty-eyed Jake,

37:53.043 --> 37:54.920
especially one's likely dead.

37:55.670 --> 37:57.422
Get it to the tunnel, Jim.

38:17.192 --> 38:19.152
You alive?

38:21.029 --> 38:22.155
FOng!

38:25.158 --> 38:26.368
You alive?

38:30.330 --> 38:31.623
Anything broke?

38:36.670 --> 38:37.921
Hey, come on.

38:46.012 --> 38:47.389
What's your name?

38:51.184 --> 38:52.352
Mei.

38:56.356 --> 38:58.191
But you must call me Fong.

39:00.569 --> 39:01.736
Mei.

39:04.823 --> 39:05.907
<i>Si Bing.</i>

39:09.536 --> 39:10.787
Yeah.

39:23.842 --> 39:26.595
Whoa.

39:37.814 --> 39:40.275
Pioneer Day come early, boys!

39:47.365 --> 39:48.366
Hey!

39:54.998 --> 39:57.876
You'll go home with the rest
of your toes, Brother Pratt.

39:59.669 --> 40:01.046
Thank you.

40:02.297 --> 40:03.506
And thank you, Brother Thor.

40:03.632 --> 40:05.550
Those boots are Heavenly Father's answer

40:05.675 --> 40:08.803
to the prayers of the Prophet's son,
Brother Pratt.

40:09.346 --> 40:12.682
He alone is responsible
for preserving what remains of...

40:13.642 --> 40:15.769
of your toes. Not me.

40:19.105 --> 40:21.191
Brother James, yes.

40:23.818 --> 40:25.612
Yeah, there you are.

41:13.076 --> 41:14.494
<i>_</i> Easy, easy-

41:22.043 --> 41:23.336
<i>_</i> Foflg-

41:27.841 --> 41:29.009
<i>Pong'?</i>

41:48.194 --> 41:50.405
Your son saved my life today.
