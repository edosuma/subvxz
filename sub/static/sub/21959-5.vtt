WEBVTT

00:06.398 --> 00:08.234
Previously on Bad Blood.

00:08.242 --> 00:11.211
We've increased
our legitimate holdings by 3%,

00:11.245 --> 00:13.323
not quite as much as I want,
but we're gettin' there.

00:13.347 --> 00:17.117
I have read shocking reporting
about the corruption

00:17.151 --> 00:19.686
that exists on all levels
of our public works.

00:19.720 --> 00:23.023
And that organized crime
has its hand in all of it.

00:23.057 --> 00:25.392
That witch is gonna
dig up everything there is.

00:25.426 --> 00:27.859
Vito is coming back to a shit storm.
Do you get that?

00:27.884 --> 00:28.984
You failed me.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.389
I know Nico wasn't easy.
But I left you in charge.

00:34.139 --> 00:35.878
They tried to wipe out the family.

00:37.642 --> 00:38.709
Including you.

00:39.398 --> 00:40.460
You're one of us.

00:41.023 --> 00:42.873
- Sal's here.
- Well, who's Sal?

00:42.898 --> 00:45.516
Sal Montagna. Acting head
of the Bonanno family.

00:45.758 --> 00:47.292
They wanted our action for years.

00:47.326 --> 00:49.494
Vito will cut your head off
if he finds you.

00:49.528 --> 00:52.382
Vito is not gonna be
doing much of anything.

00:52.798 --> 00:55.179
His organization is going to fall apart.

00:55.768 --> 00:57.669
I don't know if he still has it in him.

00:57.703 --> 00:59.137
What do you think?

00:59.171 --> 01:02.907
I think the time for diplomacy is over.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.074

02:10.342 --> 02:11.876
Top of the morning, George.

02:11.911 --> 02:12.911
Good morning.

02:13.633 --> 02:14.834
Coffee, George?

02:15.048 --> 02:16.749
You're the best. Thanks, man.

02:18.184 --> 02:19.184
Geez.

02:20.953 --> 02:22.854
The Canadiens beat
the Rangers last night.

02:23.629 --> 02:24.706
I'm done with hockey.

02:24.731 --> 02:26.528
I'm watching tennis from now on.

02:26.759 --> 02:29.627
You get five or six years,
one guy winning all the time.

02:29.662 --> 02:31.223
No disappointments.

02:32.131 --> 02:33.723
Sports is all about the drama, George.

02:34.300 --> 02:35.733
I have enough drama.

02:37.535 --> 02:39.950
Dude, do you hear that? What the hell?

02:40.012 --> 02:42.472
Go. Hide. Take the bags. Go.

03:18.310 --> 03:19.777
- What do we do?
- Shhshh!

03:47.173 --> 03:48.306
Hey, no, no, no.

04:10.095 --> 04:11.255
They got another one.

04:11.697 --> 04:12.754
At the farm.

04:12.941 --> 04:14.475
They shot George and the runners.

04:14.549 --> 04:15.782
I liked George.

04:15.841 --> 04:18.142
That's four shipments now
in the past two weeks.

04:18.190 --> 04:20.281
I just don't know how they're
getting our drop points.

04:20.305 --> 04:21.707
It's not "how."

04:21.874 --> 04:22.874
It's "who."

04:24.114 --> 04:25.825
What's going on with Sal?

04:26.215 --> 04:29.512
I put Gio on it, but
Sal, he is one slippery fish.

04:44.582 --> 04:47.665
He changes cars like
threefour times a day.

04:47.700 --> 04:49.300
One tail's just not enough.

04:49.335 --> 04:50.668
When we pick him up again,

04:50.703 --> 04:53.004
we'll need five cars just on him.

04:53.029 --> 04:55.931
And guys are starting to
switch to the other side.

04:56.200 --> 04:57.801
Not many, but it's starting.

05:01.046 --> 05:02.520
Good, good.

05:03.282 --> 05:04.726
We're going to keep hitting them hard.

05:04.750 --> 05:06.390
Big loads, small loads,
it doesn't matter.

05:06.418 --> 05:07.986
Whatever our source gives us,

05:08.473 --> 05:10.655
what's important is that
we remain relentless.

05:10.689 --> 05:13.024
Vito has a lot of friends.
Don't underestimate him.

05:13.058 --> 05:14.092
I know.

05:14.126 --> 05:16.261
But Vito's not himself these days,

05:16.295 --> 05:18.496
and that's what makes
his friends nervous.

05:21.465 --> 05:23.184
That's to be expected.

05:23.556 --> 05:24.692
What should we do?

05:26.152 --> 05:27.152
We should win.

05:46.489 --> 05:47.856
Things got crazy.

05:47.881 --> 05:51.629
We went after everyone.
I'm gonna call it a rampage.

06:05.040 --> 06:06.040
How's the steak?

06:08.614 --> 06:11.249
If we found out
someone had talked to them,

06:11.283 --> 06:12.590
we took them out.

06:12.918 --> 06:14.452
We took them out.

06:14.486 --> 06:16.473
No one was offlimits.

06:16.907 --> 06:19.008
We even took out some of our own guys

06:19.191 --> 06:21.692
who were hedging their bets,
playing both sides.

06:27.666 --> 06:29.834
In two months' time, we singlehandedly

06:29.868 --> 06:33.204
spiked the homicide rate 250%.

06:33.238 --> 06:34.806
It was fullout war.

06:34.840 --> 06:37.342
We even started to run out of
places to hide the bodies.

06:37.376 --> 06:39.310
I think we brought
two guys here last week.

06:39.345 --> 06:41.045
No, we took them to the impound.

06:41.080 --> 06:43.558
No, not those two guys. The other
two guys. From the massage parlor.

06:43.582 --> 06:44.840
Shit, you're right.

06:45.503 --> 06:46.503
Hey...

06:51.657 --> 06:53.601
The only thing any of
us was certain of was that

06:53.625 --> 06:56.582
this was gonna end up
with only one man standing.

06:56.962 --> 06:59.825
We just didn't know
who that was gonna be.

07:08.911 --> 07:10.551
There you go.

07:15.617 --> 07:17.059
I brought that for Michelle.

07:20.739 --> 07:21.942
It has bread.

07:22.397 --> 07:24.629
She doesn't eat bread.
It's just gonna go to waste.

07:27.146 --> 07:29.847
- You have a girlfriend?
- No.

07:33.206 --> 07:34.673
You should get married one day.

07:36.173 --> 07:38.508
You know, companionship
is a very important thing.

07:40.299 --> 07:41.582
I read a study.

07:42.499 --> 07:47.028
They said that loneliness
is bad for your health.

07:50.559 --> 07:52.543
You must have come
close to getting married.

07:53.879 --> 07:56.856
I mean, every man of a certain
age has, you know...

07:58.056 --> 07:59.056
The one.

08:01.104 --> 08:02.604
Who was that for you?

08:06.202 --> 08:07.235
Heather.

08:08.760 --> 08:11.184
I was... I was 2324.

08:12.512 --> 08:14.275
We met when I was out in BC

08:14.309 --> 08:16.010
picking tobacco for the summer.

08:16.473 --> 08:17.473
Yeah.

08:18.512 --> 08:20.014
It lasted almost two years.

08:20.827 --> 08:21.894
What happened?

08:22.651 --> 08:23.718
Well...

08:23.743 --> 08:25.244
In the beginning, she said

08:25.269 --> 08:27.910
she liked me because I didn't
talk that much. You know, we...

08:28.677 --> 08:30.426
sat around for hours,

08:30.603 --> 08:32.731
saying nothing, being
totally comfortable.

08:33.499 --> 08:34.533
I liked that.

08:35.811 --> 08:38.153
And then, one day she says

08:38.908 --> 08:41.610
she don't like me anymore
because I didn't talk enough.

08:47.065 --> 08:48.599
I want to ask you a question.

08:48.624 --> 08:49.957
I want you to be honest.

08:50.728 --> 08:52.739
Yeah, of course. Anything.

08:54.913 --> 08:56.496
What do you think I should do?

08:59.154 --> 09:00.955
Um...

09:04.307 --> 09:05.746
I don't know, but...

09:09.355 --> 09:11.004
Maybe it's time to walk away.

09:11.734 --> 09:12.767
Yeah?

09:13.361 --> 09:14.428
Why is that?

09:15.809 --> 09:17.528
You remember back in the day?

09:18.340 --> 09:20.192
No matter how crazy things got,

09:21.098 --> 09:22.684
you still enjoyed the work.

09:23.778 --> 09:25.146
You know, I could see that.

09:26.511 --> 09:28.278
But now it just seems like...

09:31.153 --> 09:33.254
maybe you're not enjoying it anymore.

09:38.694 --> 09:39.708
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

09:39.732 --> 09:40.732
In my office.

09:46.608 --> 09:48.209
Back in 2006,

09:48.325 --> 09:50.326
the RCMP assembled a task force

09:50.360 --> 09:52.567
to investigate organized
crime in the city.

09:53.254 --> 09:55.264
Last night, I found out
through a contact of mine

09:55.299 --> 09:57.433
that they are in possession
of thousands of hours

09:57.467 --> 09:59.602
of wiretaps from this investigation.

09:59.995 --> 10:01.029
Okay.

10:01.512 --> 10:02.746
I want those tapes.

10:05.299 --> 10:06.299
What's the problem?

10:07.856 --> 10:09.512
Our mandate is to investigate

10:09.546 --> 10:11.317
corruption in the construction industry.

10:11.746 --> 10:13.516
And we know the mafia has been dug into

10:13.550 --> 10:14.951
construction for decades.

10:14.985 --> 10:16.652
- Yes, but...
- Something on those tapes

10:16.687 --> 10:18.020
might overlap with our work.

10:18.055 --> 10:19.355
This commission was launched

10:19.389 --> 10:21.390
with more fanfare than the Olympics.

10:21.723 --> 10:22.902
If they had something we could use,

10:22.926 --> 10:24.606
don't you think they
would have offered it?

10:25.425 --> 10:26.457
Exactly.

10:27.285 --> 10:28.898
If that had been my task force,

10:28.932 --> 10:30.600
the day this commission was announced,

10:30.634 --> 10:32.340
I would have shown up with the tapes.

10:32.709 --> 10:35.262
"Here, see what you can find."

10:35.752 --> 10:38.020
"Happy to help.
We're all on the same side."

10:38.348 --> 10:40.076
You know, enforcing the law,

10:40.110 --> 10:42.770
protecting the citizens,
that kind of thing.

10:44.757 --> 10:48.512
The fact that they haven't makes
me want those tapes even more.

10:50.559 --> 10:52.395
- Come on, let's do it.
- Yep.

10:55.919 --> 10:58.186
Vito, you know I can't
be seen coming in here.

10:58.221 --> 10:59.395
Why did you insist on it?

10:59.420 --> 11:01.054
We just got this new candy.

11:02.659 --> 11:05.465
It is chocolate caramel
infused with marshmallows.

11:05.728 --> 11:07.928
This is really good. It's fantastic.
You should try one.

11:08.788 --> 11:10.922
Chief of Police is on my ass

11:10.947 --> 11:14.049
about all those goddamn bodies
you guys are piling up,

11:14.085 --> 11:17.020
that witch France Charbonneau
wants all our wiretaps,

11:17.045 --> 11:18.765
and you're gonna talk
to me about chocolate?

11:19.075 --> 11:21.543
No, seriously, try one. I
want to know what you think.

11:21.578 --> 11:22.578
Jesus...

11:24.681 --> 11:25.832
Vito, look, listen to me.

11:25.857 --> 11:29.246
I have no idea what is gonna
turn up on those wiretaps, okay?

11:30.368 --> 11:31.835
I need something from you.

11:32.254 --> 11:33.894
You need something from me?

11:33.957 --> 11:35.524
What, am I missing something here?

11:35.791 --> 11:38.246
Is this Goodfellas
Candid Camera or something?

11:38.568 --> 11:40.512
Toto Bianchi and the Ndrangheta

11:40.537 --> 11:42.438
are backing Sal Montagna,

11:42.582 --> 11:45.083
- trying to go after my territory.
- Yeah, I know.

11:45.320 --> 11:47.422
I need information from you.
What do you got?

11:50.840 --> 11:52.474
Toto gets all his juice from bookmaking.

11:53.556 --> 11:55.051
He's got a place. VIP Sportsbook.

11:55.431 --> 11:57.866
Mostly in Ontario,
but one right here in Laval.

11:57.932 --> 12:01.067
Pulls in five to seven
mil a month. Okay?

12:02.537 --> 12:03.606
It's my turn.

12:04.015 --> 12:06.309
I feel for you, and I
know you want blood,

12:06.334 --> 12:10.973
but I need you guys to stop
piling up all those bodies.

12:13.496 --> 12:14.582
Fair enough.

12:18.536 --> 12:20.254
What about the Charbonneau thing?

12:20.279 --> 12:21.846
I got to give her the tapes.

12:22.371 --> 12:24.059
No, you don't.

12:25.266 --> 12:26.799
At least, not just right now.

12:28.089 --> 12:29.106
Why not?

12:29.250 --> 12:32.996
You're going to deny them access
based on a legal argument.

12:33.958 --> 12:37.728
I'll lay out exactly what you need
to be telling your legal counsel.

12:43.024 --> 12:44.024
Come on.

12:44.522 --> 12:45.590
Try one.

12:46.013 --> 12:47.254
It'll make you feel better.

12:59.283 --> 13:01.518
You are refusing our request?

13:02.224 --> 13:04.122
Excuse me, I'm in the middle
of something right now.

13:04.146 --> 13:06.581
- If you'd like to schedule a meeting...
- Who are you?

13:06.606 --> 13:07.762
He's in I.T.

13:08.176 --> 13:10.934
- What are you doing?
- He's setting up my Facebook account.

13:11.951 --> 13:12.951
Get out.

13:21.221 --> 13:22.387
So, you were saying?

13:22.839 --> 13:26.137
What possible reason could you
have to deny us those wiretaps?

13:26.162 --> 13:28.723
It's not me, it's our lawyers.

13:28.856 --> 13:30.481
- Cut the shit.
- Second...

13:30.903 --> 13:34.364
those files, gathered for an entirely

13:34.389 --> 13:36.190
different type of investigation,

13:36.215 --> 13:37.916
fall under federal jurisdiction.

13:38.908 --> 13:40.778
Your commission is a provincial inquiry.

13:41.212 --> 13:42.679
- That is...
- Also...

13:45.006 --> 13:46.807
We have thousands of hours of tapes.

13:48.286 --> 13:49.886
To sort through all
of that would require

13:49.921 --> 13:52.823
too much time, manpower and resources.

13:52.857 --> 13:55.746
The cost of which would be enormous.

13:57.395 --> 14:00.566
Our job isn't to help you catch guys

14:00.578 --> 14:04.114
who are overcharging to fix sidewalks.

14:04.936 --> 14:07.871
Our job is to conduct actual

14:07.905 --> 14:11.567
criminal investigations
every single day.

14:12.810 --> 14:14.598
I'm sorry, would you like a coffee?

14:23.221 --> 14:26.189
You did some renovations on your
house six years ago, right?

14:27.184 --> 14:28.718
Let me refresh your memory.

14:29.779 --> 14:31.137
You paid about...

14:32.196 --> 14:34.215
- What was it?
- Eight thousand dollars.

14:35.045 --> 14:39.278
Eight thousand dollars to renovate
your kitchen and bathroom.

14:39.971 --> 14:41.653
That's a hell of a good price.

14:42.473 --> 14:44.317
I'm looking to renovate my kitchen,

14:44.700 --> 14:46.903
so I checked to see
what company you used.

14:47.612 --> 14:49.082
Interestingly enough,

14:50.498 --> 14:53.418
the contracting firm
belongs to Vito Rizzuto.

14:57.006 --> 14:58.874
You know, I do remember
those renovations.

14:59.891 --> 15:01.715
I remember I checked on the Internet.

15:02.126 --> 15:05.160
And I found a company
that had really good reviews.

15:05.870 --> 15:09.512
I didn't ask to check
their charter of ownership.

15:11.616 --> 15:15.059
Now, when you go to
the hospital for liposuction,

15:16.012 --> 15:17.507
do you research the doctor

15:17.542 --> 15:19.293
or the hospital's board of directors?

15:23.181 --> 15:27.168
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'd like to get back to this.

15:27.514 --> 15:31.856
I'm trying to post a photo of my
grandson's first crap in a toilet.

15:48.137 --> 15:49.906
We tightened our operations.

15:49.941 --> 15:52.142
We got rid of all our old stash houses.

15:52.176 --> 15:54.377
We gave jobs to only
our most trusted guys,

15:54.412 --> 15:57.280
and still, Sal kept ripping us off.

15:58.966 --> 16:00.066
Don't move.

16:00.251 --> 16:02.364
Easy, easy. Okay, okay.

16:03.379 --> 16:05.114
Just let 'em... Let 'em take it, guys.

16:05.404 --> 16:06.404
Go ahead.

16:12.945 --> 16:13.945
Thank you, gentlemen.

16:26.175 --> 16:27.409
I wouldn't do that.

16:27.934 --> 16:29.312
It's the only shot I got.

16:29.457 --> 16:31.207
Yeah, I know, but
you're not gonna make it.

16:32.020 --> 16:33.827
You should bank that
ball behind the yellow.

16:33.852 --> 16:35.801
- That way, I've got no shot.
- All right.

16:36.744 --> 16:38.965
Gio, give us a minute.

16:41.523 --> 16:43.124
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

16:44.362 --> 16:45.395
Sure.

16:51.135 --> 16:52.551
They found another one.

16:54.379 --> 16:55.305
Shit.

16:55.339 --> 16:58.145
Yeah, shit. We're losing ground.
I mean...

16:58.609 --> 17:00.137
We gotta find out who's talking.

17:01.179 --> 17:05.175
I say, from now on, only you, me
and Gio know the dropoff points.

17:06.239 --> 17:09.457
I've made this impossible to
screw up, even for you three.

17:10.121 --> 17:12.192
The van is parked in the warehouse.

17:12.589 --> 17:16.582
After you make the pickup,
just follow the GPS.

17:17.094 --> 17:19.981
I programmed the route
right to the drop point.

17:21.115 --> 17:23.675
And give me all your phones,
they're gonna stay with me.

17:26.848 --> 17:29.121
Hey, what are you sitting down for?
Now, get out of here.

17:54.065 --> 17:55.403
What? Is this it?

17:57.602 --> 17:58.739
What the hell?

18:00.582 --> 18:01.972
There supposed to be
somebody meeting us here?

18:01.996 --> 18:03.283
- There's three people.
- Holy shit!

18:03.307 --> 18:04.947
Whoa, whoa.
You know what? He's got a gun.

18:06.377 --> 18:07.676
God damn it.

18:14.442 --> 18:15.745
Everybody, everybody.

18:15.770 --> 18:17.671
Everybody, listen up. Listen up.

18:17.696 --> 18:20.262
I want to propose a birthday toast

18:20.766 --> 18:22.762
to the beautiful Michelle.

18:23.051 --> 18:26.070
The beautiful, smart,
sexy and intriguing.

18:26.104 --> 18:27.785
Good one.

18:28.489 --> 18:29.645
Happy birthday!

18:29.716 --> 18:31.908
Happy birthday.
Come on, raise your glasses.

18:54.166 --> 18:57.309
Declan! Where have you been?

18:57.512 --> 18:59.231
It's called being fashionably late.

18:59.340 --> 19:01.316
And there was a girl at the
bar who wouldn't let me go.

19:01.340 --> 19:03.715
You better be taking her home

19:04.028 --> 19:06.410
if it took you this long
to wish me happy birthday.

19:06.445 --> 19:07.812
Happy birthday, baby.

19:07.846 --> 19:10.121
Aw! You shouldn't have.

19:10.598 --> 19:12.783
Hey, look, if she's not
going home with you,

19:12.818 --> 19:14.251
I have three friends who are just

19:14.286 --> 19:16.087
drunk enough to go home with you.

19:16.121 --> 19:17.355
All right. Thank you.

19:18.623 --> 19:20.157
Declan and I gotta go talk, all right?

19:20.192 --> 19:22.059
- No business.
- No business.

19:22.094 --> 19:24.895
You just can't hear in here.
No business, I promise.

19:29.780 --> 19:30.780
Yay!

19:39.704 --> 19:40.838
Tell me everything.

19:42.676 --> 19:43.981
Gio met with the guys,

19:44.016 --> 19:45.827
just like you and I planned.

19:45.851 --> 19:47.418
He changed the dropoff location

19:47.452 --> 19:48.809
on route, last minute,

19:48.834 --> 19:51.131
so only they knew where it was.

19:51.490 --> 19:53.974
Then I filled Gio in on
the rest of the plan, right?

19:53.999 --> 19:56.667
That we were gonna hide
in a secret compartment.

20:14.112 --> 20:16.080
What the hell are you
guys doing back there?

20:23.540 --> 20:24.621
Holy shit.

20:24.799 --> 20:27.301
Thank you. Thank you.
They were gonna kill us.

20:28.410 --> 20:29.645
Yeah, they were.

20:30.067 --> 20:32.596
You three were the only ones

20:32.631 --> 20:33.991
who knew where the drop point was.

20:36.386 --> 20:37.386
Who's the rat?

20:37.803 --> 20:39.270
No.

20:39.304 --> 20:41.205
- You?
- No. No, no, no.

20:41.239 --> 20:43.240
We made the pickup
and followed the GPS.

20:43.275 --> 20:45.700
- You?
- Declan, Man. Look, I swear.

20:45.998 --> 20:47.403
I swear on my family.

21:07.242 --> 21:08.676
How far are we gonna take this?

21:12.114 --> 21:13.114
All the way.

21:27.454 --> 21:29.660
It was Gio. It was him.

21:31.182 --> 21:32.983
I should have seen it sooner.
I'm sorry, boss.

22:57.996 --> 22:59.076
Had enough?

22:59.110 --> 23:00.744
Hey, isn't she beautiful?

23:00.779 --> 23:02.379
Isn't Michelle beautiful?

23:02.414 --> 23:05.395
Gorgeous. Give her a kiss. Give
her a birthday kiss. Come on.

23:11.101 --> 23:12.668
Is that what you wanted to see?

23:14.636 --> 23:15.669
Yeah.

23:16.695 --> 23:17.861
Yeah.

23:19.238 --> 23:20.305
Screw you.

24:40.564 --> 24:42.754
Jeanne, would you mind
bringing me a coffee?

24:42.901 --> 24:44.402
- Of course.
- Thank you.

24:48.268 --> 24:49.606
Why are you still awake?

24:51.645 --> 24:53.089
You can finish Harry Potter tomorrow.

24:53.113 --> 24:54.680
Daddy said you could stay up?

24:58.246 --> 25:00.848
I'll be here a few more
hours, my love. I'm sorry...

25:01.199 --> 25:03.834
I know, I know. I would
have loved to read with you.

25:08.840 --> 25:10.908
I have to get back to work, honey, okay?

25:10.933 --> 25:13.004
I'll see you in the morning. I promise.

25:14.040 --> 25:15.040
I love you.

25:22.926 --> 25:26.590
Jeanne, I want every file
on snow removal contracts

25:26.615 --> 25:28.825
- in the city and surrounding areas.
- Now?

25:29.535 --> 25:31.331
I would like them now, but unless

25:31.356 --> 25:33.556
you can break into City Hall
in the middle of the night,

25:33.693 --> 25:34.973
that's impossible.

25:35.160 --> 25:36.168
Thank you.

25:36.356 --> 25:38.340
Go home, Jeanne. Thanks for everything.

25:38.893 --> 25:40.693
- Good night, Madam Charbonneau.
- Good night.

25:56.001 --> 25:57.468
I was at my mother's.

25:58.515 --> 25:59.778
I needed some time.

26:00.503 --> 26:01.503
That's fine.

26:04.801 --> 26:05.868
Are you going out?

26:07.193 --> 26:08.193
I am.

26:10.442 --> 26:11.535
Can we talk?

26:12.192 --> 26:13.192
Of course.

26:18.637 --> 26:20.081
I have a lot of patience, Vito,

26:20.106 --> 26:21.489
but right now, I'm not patient.

26:22.159 --> 26:23.159
I'm stuck.

26:24.859 --> 26:27.090
I don't know how to talk
to you about anything.

26:29.042 --> 26:32.176
I feel guilty talking about
my feelings because

26:32.720 --> 26:35.942
how dare I talk about myself
after what you've been through?

26:36.997 --> 26:37.997
That's a lot.

26:41.866 --> 26:44.489
You're... not an average man.

26:45.114 --> 26:47.067
You don't react in average ways.

26:52.459 --> 26:54.593
If you wanna burn
the city to the ground,

26:56.216 --> 26:57.550
I'll still be here.

27:01.278 --> 27:02.732
If you want to destroy yourself,

27:02.757 --> 27:04.324
or shut down completely,

27:06.383 --> 27:08.090
I will still be here.

27:09.810 --> 27:11.611
I shouldn't, but I will.

27:17.108 --> 27:19.075
I should have wanted more for my life.

27:21.069 --> 27:22.637
I deserved more.

27:27.056 --> 27:29.176
But I'd be lying if
I said I would leave.

27:33.547 --> 27:34.547
But...

27:35.430 --> 27:38.137
You cannot treat me like garbage

27:39.018 --> 27:40.856
because you feel like shit.

27:42.952 --> 27:44.598
I won't stay for that.

28:03.808 --> 28:06.371
You know, when Nico was
about one years old,

28:10.289 --> 28:13.981
he used to wake up at 3 a.m.
every morning, like clockwork.

28:16.284 --> 28:18.486
And I'd get up and I'd go to his room,

28:19.887 --> 28:20.926
I'd get him,

28:22.416 --> 28:23.817
bring him back with me.

28:26.521 --> 28:28.189
And he'd go right back to sleep.

28:33.102 --> 28:34.470
And every morning,

28:36.222 --> 28:37.917
I used to wake up to the...

28:39.134 --> 28:43.838
touch of soft little hands on my face.

28:51.658 --> 28:53.778
I hadn't thought
about that in a long time.

28:58.879 --> 29:00.913
Now every morning, when I wake up,

29:03.096 --> 29:04.596
for half a second,

29:08.088 --> 29:09.825
I can feel those little fingers.

29:19.058 --> 29:22.694
That half second is the only
reason that I'm still here.

29:28.504 --> 29:30.098
I shouldn't have embarrassed you.

29:30.937 --> 29:32.692
I know better. I can do better.

29:37.026 --> 29:38.684
But that's all I got right now.

29:39.644 --> 29:41.145
That's all I got to give.

29:52.732 --> 29:53.871
I gotta go.

30:16.272 --> 30:17.439
I gotta go.

30:23.786 --> 30:25.554
I hope you're still
here when I get back.

30:32.672 --> 30:36.129
So I tell him, start
the engine and listen.

30:37.528 --> 30:39.091
So he turns the key over.

30:39.387 --> 30:42.075
Now, this sound. This sound, like...

30:42.176 --> 30:43.597
Like it ain't from this planet.

30:43.622 --> 30:46.198
It's like a mon...
Like a monkey on fire.

30:46.223 --> 30:47.692
I mean, biting the nuts off...

30:47.727 --> 30:49.127
Hey, pardon my French.

30:49.161 --> 30:50.354
So he goes over to the hood,

30:50.379 --> 30:51.996
pops it up, looks in, what's in there?

30:52.031 --> 30:53.531
A skunk.

30:53.739 --> 30:55.800
A skunk is all wrapped
up inside the engine.

30:55.835 --> 30:57.104
The poor thing. And the thing,

30:57.129 --> 31:00.300
the second he opens up the hood,
it pisses and sprays...

31:00.325 --> 31:01.539
What's going on?

31:01.574 --> 31:02.640
What the hell?

31:02.675 --> 31:04.409
Easy, guys. Easy.

31:05.145 --> 31:06.412
I'm just here to talk.

31:07.613 --> 31:09.280
Yeah, well, I don't wanna talk to you.

31:09.315 --> 31:11.182
Well, you don't have
to do much talking.

31:11.217 --> 31:12.717
- Can I get you anything?
- Piss off.

31:13.966 --> 31:16.000
You picked the wrong side, Toto.

31:17.289 --> 31:18.757
But I understand why.

31:20.760 --> 31:21.942
You're an underdog.

31:22.495 --> 31:24.028
Somebody gave you a gold medal.

31:24.196 --> 31:25.879
And you're sick of coming in last.

31:26.732 --> 31:29.934
People identify with an underdog.
You understand why?

31:30.836 --> 31:32.704
Because they can't
identify with champions,

31:32.738 --> 31:34.439
they identify with losers.

31:35.692 --> 31:37.108
But me, I'm not like that.

31:37.143 --> 31:38.364
I like to pick favorites.

31:38.978 --> 31:40.411
I think the best should win.

31:42.364 --> 31:44.262
You got a couple of shipments,

31:44.550 --> 31:46.117
you pulled in a couple of defectors,

31:46.152 --> 31:47.886
now you think momentum is on your side.

31:47.920 --> 31:49.942
But this ain't a movie.

31:51.024 --> 31:53.392
David doesn't even get
to load the slingshot.

31:54.361 --> 31:56.028
Goliath just steps on him.

31:57.797 --> 31:59.481
The VIP Sportsbook,

32:00.384 --> 32:01.885
that's what keeps you guys floating.

32:03.664 --> 32:05.223
That's what makes you worth something.

32:06.985 --> 32:08.419
I'm gonna let you keep it.

32:09.909 --> 32:11.576
But you gotta break ties with Sal,

32:11.610 --> 32:12.977
and you gotta side with me.

32:15.507 --> 32:16.907
You're gonna let me keep it?

32:20.686 --> 32:22.854
You're gonna be sitting
on a big pile of ash

32:22.888 --> 32:24.278
in a couple of months, Vito.

32:24.723 --> 32:26.157
I'm gonna let you keep it

32:26.192 --> 32:28.637
and I'm not even gonna take
a piece of the action.

32:29.328 --> 32:30.929
I'm gonna leave it as is.

32:30.963 --> 32:32.067
All yours.

32:33.410 --> 32:34.942
You know, I worry about you.

32:35.756 --> 32:38.270
Something tells me you're
not in your right mind.

32:45.025 --> 32:47.059
You should answer that.
It's gonna keep ringing.

32:48.059 --> 32:50.035
It's your bar manager. Jocelyne.

32:57.395 --> 32:58.387
Yeah.

32:58.412 --> 33:00.291
I'm staring at a bunch of cops outside.

33:00.326 --> 33:02.660
I don't know what they want.
No one will talk to me.

33:05.596 --> 33:06.596
Sit tight.

33:09.301 --> 33:10.348
Now.

33:11.382 --> 33:12.848
In exactly one minute,

33:13.700 --> 33:17.178
I'm gonna pick up that phone
and I'm gonna call those cops.

33:18.102 --> 33:20.067
And I can tell the cops to...

33:21.262 --> 33:22.262
leave

33:24.076 --> 33:25.776
and you can keep riding
the money train.

33:27.152 --> 33:28.559
Or I can tell 'em to bust in,

33:28.691 --> 33:31.215
stop your pipeline and shut you down.

33:38.581 --> 33:39.606
Yeah?

33:45.309 --> 33:49.004
Okay, that's it.
Everyone, let's go home.

34:02.012 --> 34:04.114
Maybe Sal will just pack
it up and leave now.

34:04.431 --> 34:07.634
No. Too humiliating for him
to leave with nothing.

34:09.027 --> 34:10.629
He's gonna dig his heels in.

34:10.971 --> 34:12.724
- You should call some reinforcements.
- Right.

34:12.748 --> 34:14.349
- This ain't over.
- You're right.

34:35.371 --> 34:37.532
Well, it's a bit out of the
way, but it's a nice drive.

34:39.215 --> 34:40.215
What is this place?

34:41.710 --> 34:43.176
I own this property.

34:45.572 --> 34:47.940
Gonna build a gated
community or a mansion?

34:48.790 --> 34:50.157
Not gonna build anything.

34:51.764 --> 34:52.998
Got you a sandwich.

34:56.556 --> 34:58.224
Declan, you mind
giving us a few minutes?

35:00.113 --> 35:01.113
No, I don't mind.

35:10.545 --> 35:12.579
- Your deli?
- Yeah.

35:13.891 --> 35:15.258
What can I do for you?

35:20.094 --> 35:21.428
I got cancer, Vito.

35:22.439 --> 35:25.332
Liver, stage two, 5050 chance.

35:30.588 --> 35:32.656
I know the best cancer
doctor in the city.

35:33.458 --> 35:35.317
I'm sure you do.

35:36.719 --> 35:38.820
No, my doctor's an old friend.
I trust him.

35:41.804 --> 35:43.614
But I didn't call you
just to tell you that.

35:44.342 --> 35:47.145
Even if I do pull through
this, I'm retiring.

35:48.995 --> 35:50.043
Of course.

35:50.812 --> 35:52.364
You gotta take care of yourself.

35:59.278 --> 36:01.591
I've been thinking
about this for a while, Vito.

36:03.742 --> 36:04.989
I can't do this no more.

36:06.107 --> 36:07.307
Our partnership.

36:09.241 --> 36:10.785
Too old, too tired.

36:12.900 --> 36:14.386
Every time someone rings the doorbell,

36:14.410 --> 36:16.205
I think they're gonna
take me away in cuffs.

36:18.759 --> 36:20.403
The fact that it hasn't happened,

36:20.717 --> 36:22.085
just by the grace of God,

36:23.450 --> 36:25.739
has me questioning God altogether.

36:27.349 --> 36:28.543
You'll be okay.

36:29.143 --> 36:30.715
You're stronger than you think.

36:35.187 --> 36:37.590
I want you to know
that you can trust me, Vito.

36:39.718 --> 36:42.854
No matter what, I will
never rat you out. Never.

36:52.259 --> 36:53.993
Do I have your blessing to leave?

37:01.267 --> 37:03.368
We've known each other 30 years, Gio.

37:06.216 --> 37:07.216
We're okay.

37:14.383 --> 37:15.650
Thanks, Vito.

37:19.143 --> 37:21.077
I will always think of you as a friend.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.235
A friend that you can never see again.

37:29.387 --> 37:30.387
Yeah.

37:39.997 --> 37:41.715
Maybe you should retire, Vito.

37:42.421 --> 37:44.746
Go live in the islands
or something, you know.

37:45.161 --> 37:46.661
Die a bored old man.

38:00.830 --> 38:03.031
He's dying.

38:03.504 --> 38:04.504
Cancer.

38:08.766 --> 38:11.034
- Take me home.
- Hey, Vito. Vito.

38:11.164 --> 38:13.918
- Let's go out. Let's do something.
- I'm tired.

38:14.731 --> 38:16.810
You're tired? Come on, you spend
half the time in the house.

38:16.834 --> 38:18.583
You never leave anymore.
Let's do something. I'll do anything.

38:18.607 --> 38:20.903
- I'll even play golf with you.
- You hate golf.

38:20.928 --> 38:23.075
- I do, but I'd do it for you.
- Just take me home.

38:23.546 --> 38:26.482
I've seen you swing. Bet you
1,000 bucks I can beat you.

38:32.021 --> 38:34.707
This is the most pathetic
mini golf I have ever seen.

38:34.741 --> 38:38.332
Yeah, the boy inside says the kids
keep stealing the little houses.

38:39.014 --> 38:40.645
They should bolt 'em down.

38:41.501 --> 38:45.200
Well, the owner's a nice old religious
man. He's got faith in people.

38:45.518 --> 38:46.637
Yeah, well.

38:46.856 --> 38:49.762
Hammer and nails do a lot for
effect, you should remind them.

38:50.480 --> 38:53.551
- You think this Aucoin thing's a sign?
- Yeah.

38:53.850 --> 38:55.895
Yeah, we're gonna
have to fill his shoes.

38:56.071 --> 38:58.272
I mean, you two, you moved up together.

38:58.369 --> 38:59.945
And to forge a new relationship with

38:59.970 --> 39:01.872
someone that high up
is not gonna be easy.

39:01.897 --> 39:02.989
That's true.

39:03.427 --> 39:05.328
If we act out on the original plan.

39:07.007 --> 39:08.903
- What's that?
- To go legit.

39:09.520 --> 39:12.535
Keep everything above board.
Become pillars of the community.

39:14.795 --> 39:15.856
Why?

39:16.347 --> 39:19.551
Well, because you told me,
years ago, you had a vision.

39:19.928 --> 39:21.795
Well, we can act out on that now.

39:21.924 --> 39:23.731
There's no one left to come after us.

39:23.756 --> 39:25.582
This can be the
beginning of our legacy.

39:25.607 --> 39:26.614
Legacy?

39:27.734 --> 39:29.200
My legacy is done.

39:29.930 --> 39:32.999
I don't murder the families
of schoolteachers or doctors,

39:33.166 --> 39:34.400
the pillars of the community.

39:35.165 --> 39:36.232
Just gangsters.

39:42.682 --> 39:43.849
You cheated.

39:43.874 --> 39:45.318
- What are you talking about?
- You cheated.

39:45.342 --> 39:46.951
- No, I beat you...
- Took the only good putter.

39:46.975 --> 39:48.288
You saw it, you rat bastard,

39:48.313 --> 39:50.150
- you're like a little kid.
- Took it right out of the rack.

39:50.174 --> 39:51.512
Like a rat bastard kid.

39:52.458 --> 39:54.826
Well, I can pay you... Can't
imagine what you were like.

39:56.739 --> 39:58.373
- What?
- What were you like as a kid?

39:58.398 --> 39:59.398
- A kid?
- Yeah.

40:00.210 --> 40:01.210
All right.

40:02.287 --> 40:03.287
My...

40:04.522 --> 40:05.522
My mom...

40:07.442 --> 40:08.538
If you can call her that.

40:08.572 --> 40:11.374
She... She left when I was six.

40:11.408 --> 40:13.332
And my little sister was four.

40:14.162 --> 40:17.898
She had bipolar manic depression,
whatever you want to call it.

40:19.309 --> 40:20.856
So, a couple of years go by.

40:21.161 --> 40:24.309
And, my old man hooks up with
this woman. She was a junkie.

40:25.204 --> 40:26.370
And...

40:28.821 --> 40:30.355
She got him into the needle.

40:31.651 --> 40:33.731
Hard, fast. He... He...

40:34.151 --> 40:36.119
He was all in, doubled down.

40:37.160 --> 40:38.996
And the girlfriend...

40:40.057 --> 40:42.660
Couple of years later,
nine, I was. She said,

40:43.277 --> 40:45.457
"Get rid of 'em. Get rid of the kids."

40:46.397 --> 40:48.535
And that's what he did.
He just gave us away.

40:49.354 --> 40:51.155
Your father gave his kids away?

40:52.764 --> 40:53.770
Yeah.

40:54.934 --> 40:58.187
Yeah, and I... I couldn't even be
with my little sister 'cause,

40:59.162 --> 41:01.997
we were at different
foster homes, you know.

41:04.054 --> 41:05.825
What happened to your father?

41:06.698 --> 41:08.575
No idea. I've never seen him since.

41:17.579 --> 41:18.779
Goodnight, Declan.

42:00.848 --> 42:02.549
Everything's almost in place.

42:03.902 --> 42:06.137
We're gonna come at Vito
with a coordinated attack

42:06.162 --> 42:09.582
that's gonna make Normandy Beach
look like a pride parade.

42:13.609 --> 42:16.910
But I gotta say, that move
he made against Toto...

42:17.903 --> 42:19.707
Classic Vito.

42:22.104 --> 42:25.012
But you're right, you're
right, good for us.

42:25.989 --> 42:27.757
He'll think he gained some ground.

42:27.782 --> 42:29.583
Keep him looking
in the other direction.

42:34.248 --> 42:35.849
You've really shown me something here.

42:38.800 --> 42:40.176
Glad you're on our side.

42:41.596 --> 42:44.684
You're smart.
There's no doubt about that.

42:45.583 --> 42:48.651
When you're in charge, nobody's
gonna mess with you after this.

42:52.335 --> 42:54.103
It's one thing to cut a side deal.

42:54.776 --> 42:56.176
Make some information.

42:58.100 --> 43:00.268
It's another thing to take down a boss.

43:01.484 --> 43:03.043
That last step is the big one.

43:03.068 --> 43:04.700
It's the only one that matters.

43:05.306 --> 43:07.887
Separates the proletariats
from the king.

43:10.602 --> 43:12.103
Are you ready to be a king?

43:15.040 --> 43:16.215
Absolutely.
