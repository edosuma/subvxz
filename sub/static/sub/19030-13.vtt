WEBVTT

00:01.962 --> 00:03.420
Hey, Robyn.
It's good to see you again.

00:03.670 --> 00:04.963
Now according to your chart,

00:05.083 --> 00:07.207
your hair has been falling out,
your nails are splitting

00:07.327 --> 00:08.680
and you're fatigued.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.654
Robyn, you're a zombie.

00:12.218 --> 00:13.818
Patient also grumpy

00:13.985 --> 00:16.763
and not responding to classic comedy.

00:17.344 --> 00:18.799
Just a little hard to find the funny

00:18.966 --> 00:21.980
when you're 32,
single and balding.

00:22.447 --> 00:23.449
Point taken.

00:23.616 --> 00:25.489
We're gonna figure this out, okay?

00:25.656 --> 00:28.862
And don't you worry, if you
need me, I will be here all night.

00:30.737 --> 00:32.824
- So you're working tonight too, huh?
- Yeah.

00:33.074 --> 00:34.710
I'm new on-call surgical attending.

00:34.877 --> 00:37.954
I kind of signed up because JD
was supposed to be working with me.

00:38.204 --> 00:40.754
I'm covering for him.
He and Sam went on a trip to...

00:42.058 --> 00:44.336
You know what?
It's not important.

00:44.456 --> 00:46.212
No, no. Finish your thought.

00:46.924 --> 00:50.383
I didn't want to tell you this. Kim had
a medical conference in Anaheim.

00:50.550 --> 00:53.428
And so JD went and
took Sam to Disneyland.

00:53.807 --> 00:56.556
That's impossible. Because
he and I swore to each other

00:56.806 --> 00:58.988
that since we've never
been to Disneyland

00:59.108 --> 01:01.384
that we would go for
our 40th birthday together.

01:01.504 --> 01:04.468
- What do you want me to say?
- That he's not at Disneyland right now.

01:04.587 --> 01:06.110
- Can you tell me that?
- No.

01:06.548 --> 01:08.278
You know what? Adults move on.

01:08.398 --> 01:10.563
And that's what I'm doing right now,
I'm moving on.

01:10.730 --> 01:12.243
How do you want to handle
tonight's workload?

01:12.363 --> 01:14.285
- I was think...
- I can't do it Elliot!

01:14.452 --> 01:15.602
You know, I tried!

01:16.007 --> 01:17.552
I tried but it hurts too bad.

01:17.672 --> 01:20.308
It hurts me deep right here.
I can feel it in my chest.

01:20.475 --> 01:22.873
That man went to
Disneyland without me!

01:23.040 --> 01:25.654
They got roller coasters that
roller-coaster in the dark.

01:26.379 --> 01:28.093
You don't where
the turns are coming from.

01:28.213 --> 01:31.294
They've got the <i>Finding Nemo</i> ride
where you ride in round with Nemo.

01:31.461 --> 01:34.302
It is a ride!
A ride with Nemo!

01:34.552 --> 01:37.459
Tonight's gonna be great. My co-pilot
here is a blubbering man-child.

01:37.579 --> 01:40.547
and the interns begin to think
they know what they're doing.

01:41.254 --> 01:43.322
We totally saved that
patient's life up there.

01:43.489 --> 01:45.228
Cancer's our bitch!

01:47.109 --> 01:50.133
No one does a Foley cath
like Howie Gilder.

01:51.239 --> 01:52.239
Up high!

01:53.739 --> 01:55.584
I'm not gonna get mad
because you're new.

01:55.751 --> 01:57.747
But I'm kind of the
high-fiver around here.

01:58.051 --> 02:01.635
From now on, you're only allowed
to high-five when I'm not here.

02:02.040 --> 02:03.379
Are we clear five?

02:04.959 --> 02:07.361
You may hit that
because I'm instigating.

02:09.669 --> 02:11.315
Now get the hell out of here.

02:12.528 --> 02:14.618
I put that central line
on Mr. Phelps for you.

02:14.738 --> 02:16.600
So next time you
give me an assignment,

02:16.720 --> 02:18.594
can you make it something
that's a challenge?

02:18.714 --> 02:20.850
- Okay. Next time.
- Make sure you do.

02:21.589 --> 02:23.072
That's my surgical intern.

02:23.613 --> 02:26.366
He's been here less time than
everyone else and that's how he acts.

02:26.710 --> 02:29.789
You know what we should do?
We should scare the hell out of them.

02:32.989 --> 02:34.778
Full moon tonight, guys.

02:35.030 --> 02:36.608
Wanna know what that means?

02:36.728 --> 02:38.864
Means it's getting
fricking crazy up in here!

02:39.613 --> 02:41.493
Buckle up for some nasty stuff.

02:41.613 --> 02:43.964
I'm talking nightmares that
you cannot unsee.

02:44.600 --> 02:46.517
During my first full moon shift,

02:46.637 --> 02:49.753
psych patient Tony Belmont
bit off his own tongue.

02:49.873 --> 02:51.482
And threw it at me.

02:52.030 --> 02:54.780
We couldn't reattach
the sucker so I tossed it

02:55.138 --> 02:57.494
into that very Hazmat bin.

02:58.753 --> 03:00.269
Later that night,

03:00.389 --> 03:02.718
we heard a sound
coming from in there.

03:03.063 --> 03:06.611
So we open up the lid
very very slowly.

03:07.086 --> 03:08.491
And inside,

03:08.611 --> 03:11.419
is Mr. Belmont
holding his own tongue.

03:11.586 --> 03:13.217
Do you want to know
what he said to me?

03:15.705 --> 03:16.696
He said...

03:22.173 --> 03:23.994
Nailed it! Give it up!

03:24.721 --> 03:26.443
Guys! High-fiving?

03:26.685 --> 03:28.655
I feel like I've been
more than clear about this.

03:29.077 --> 03:31.050
It won't happen again, Todd.
Promise.

03:31.170 --> 03:33.160
You're my friends, so I hope not.

03:33.280 --> 03:34.296
I'm sorry five?

03:36.237 --> 03:37.966
- Still.
- Still.

Season 8 Episode 13
My Full Moon

03:55.121 --> 03:56.449
{\pos(192,220)}Alright, Robyn. Here's the deal.

03:56.569 --> 03:59.471
{\pos(192,220)}The last time you were here, all your
health issues were from malnourishment.

03:59.638 --> 04:01.479
{\pos(192,220)}And now, a year later,

04:01.646 --> 04:03.952
{\pos(192,220)}you're nine pounds lighter than
you were at your lowest rate.

04:04.360 --> 04:07.038
{\pos(192,220)}You know what's weird.
I really have been eating.

04:07.866 --> 04:10.872
{\pos(192,220)}I'm gonna have you talk to
a specialist named Dr. Paulson.

04:10.992 --> 04:12.001
{\pos(192,220)}He's on his way.

04:15.972 --> 04:17.632
Why are you having her
talk to the staff shrink?

04:18.197 --> 04:19.634
Because she's anorexic, Turk.

04:20.091 --> 04:21.391
{\pos(192,220)}You know, I...

04:21.865 --> 04:25.199
{\pos(192,220)}I have a complicated
psychological issue too.

04:26.597 --> 04:29.394
{\pos(192,220)}Mrs. Powell, your gall
bladder surgery went terrific.

04:29.862 --> 04:33.015
{\pos(192,220)}However I can't discharge you
until I'm sure your pipes are working.

04:33.135 --> 04:35.387
{\pos(192,220)}And since you said it's impossible
for you to go number two

04:35.507 --> 04:38.127
{\pos(192,220)} outside of your house due to the
fact that you're a nervous pooer...

04:38.385 --> 04:40.067
{\pos(192,220)}I feel you, sister.

04:40.457 --> 04:42.354
{\pos(192,220)}I'm gonna have to
ask you to pass gas.

04:42.612 --> 04:44.136
Excuse me?

04:44.303 --> 04:45.529
You know...

04:46.661 --> 04:47.920
I don't do that.

04:48.162 --> 04:49.468
{\pos(192,190)}- Women fart.
- You know.

04:49.588 --> 04:51.147
{\pos(192,190)}- We should go.
- I know they do.

04:51.267 --> 04:53.552
{\pos(192,190)}Cause I have a wife and
a daughter, and they both fart...

04:53.672 --> 04:55.517
{\pos(192,220)}And she farts and I smelt it before.

04:55.684 --> 04:57.463
{\pos(192,220)}It smells like hot dogs.

04:59.347 --> 05:00.834
{\pos(192,220)}Okay guys, full moon is upon us.

05:00.954 --> 05:03.574
{\pos(192,220)}It's only 8:30, we already have
10 new admissions so let's stay sharp.

05:03.694 --> 05:05.824
{\pos(192,220)}Nights like this
are why you got into medicine.

05:05.944 --> 05:08.604
{\pos(192,220)}Sunny, I'm gonna need you to get
that lady in bed six to fart.

05:08.724 --> 05:10.935
- I'm on it.
- Why don't you just pull her finger?

05:11.185 --> 05:12.896
Howie, did you just make a joke?

05:13.146 --> 05:14.569
I did and it felt great.

05:14.689 --> 05:15.772
Good for you.

05:15.892 --> 05:18.099
{\pos(192,220)}And as a reward,
you get the gentleman in bed three.

05:18.219 --> 05:20.477
{\pos(192,220)}He poisoned himself.
We need to know what he took. Go.

05:20.597 --> 05:21.534
Gone.

05:21.701 --> 05:25.455
{\pos(192,220)}My pneumonia patient is presenting with
a crap load of fluid in her left lung.

05:25.575 --> 05:27.535
Crap load really
isn't a technical term.

05:27.785 --> 05:29.037
Fine. Bucket load.

05:29.287 --> 05:31.046
{\pos(192,220)}Is she being sassy?
Because I love it.

05:31.166 --> 05:32.707
{\pos(192,220)}More than Space Mountain?

05:32.957 --> 05:34.028
Why, Elliot?

05:34.284 --> 05:35.634
{\pos(192,220)}I just forgot about it.

05:36.024 --> 05:38.314
{\pos(192,220)}Derek, can you get Denise's
patient a thoracentesis

05:38.434 --> 05:39.761
{\pos(192,220)}and get that fluid out of there?

05:39.881 --> 05:41.781
{\pos(192,220)}Surgery to the rescue.

05:42.106 --> 05:43.264
{\pos(192,220)}You are welcome.

05:43.741 --> 05:46.484
Oh that's adorable.
You have a crush on yourself.

05:46.651 --> 05:49.352
I'd be careful. The guy
you're in love with is a douche.

05:50.629 --> 05:51.829
Where's Katie?

05:52.727 --> 05:55.860
I've been doing post-op
on your hand surgery patient Mr. Gold.

05:56.027 --> 05:58.858
He says he can't feel anything
in his arms from his elbows up.

05:59.108 --> 06:00.988
Now, I've been doing
research for hours,

06:01.108 --> 06:04.614
and I think it's either a radiculopathy
or a brachial plexus injury.

06:05.200 --> 06:05.947
Or...

06:08.480 --> 06:10.703
He's lying. Patients do that.

06:11.259 --> 06:12.497
Katie, a word please?

06:13.155 --> 06:15.291
Look, the man is
homeless and not all there.

06:15.411 --> 06:18.391
You see his bandages? It means
he's been chewing out his sutures.

06:18.725 --> 06:20.259
I'm probably gonna
have to strap him down.

06:20.379 --> 06:22.530
I can find another
way to make him stop.

06:22.650 --> 06:25.768
Suit yourself. If he messes up
my handiwork, it's on you.

06:28.602 --> 06:29.952
Hi, Mr. Gold.

06:30.431 --> 06:33.156
Can you do me a favor
and stop chewing on your hands?

06:33.434 --> 06:34.350
Pass.

06:37.286 --> 06:39.786
I had to talk to
that shrink for an hour.

06:39.953 --> 06:42.110
Dr Reid, I am not anorexic.

06:42.833 --> 06:46.537
You've lost weight, you're anemic.
Your prealbumine is low.

06:46.883 --> 06:48.783
All symptoms point to it.

06:49.033 --> 06:52.704
Who are you gonna believe?
Me or that stupid chart?

06:52.954 --> 06:55.138
Robyn, I'm a doctor.
We believe everything on the charts.

06:55.258 --> 06:57.439
That's why I write
"Elliot has a slammin' tushie"

06:57.559 --> 07:00.021
on every single one,
see? Right here.

07:02.802 --> 07:05.752
I keep making jokes at all
the wrong times, don't I?

07:07.013 --> 07:09.267
I know that this is hard...

07:09.387 --> 07:11.606
It's only hard because it isn't true.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.353
I've been eating.

07:15.149 --> 07:17.228
You have already made up
your mind, haven't you?

07:19.681 --> 07:22.775
Mrs. Powell, it's not your fault
you don't want to pass gas.

07:23.223 --> 07:24.569
It's society's.

07:24.918 --> 07:28.281
Guys have always been allowed
to do it. There's no shame for them.

07:28.806 --> 07:32.118
But if a girl lets out even
a little squeeker, she's a freak.

07:32.705 --> 07:34.037
So come on,

07:34.254 --> 07:37.914
for women everywhere, let's do it
together on the count of three.

07:38.649 --> 07:39.649
One,

07:39.960 --> 07:40.960
two,

07:41.325 --> 07:42.128
three.

07:44.338 --> 07:45.548
You didn't do it.

07:45.798 --> 07:47.091
Neither did you.

07:47.749 --> 07:49.249
There's people around.

07:50.648 --> 07:52.007
Hey Mr. Swick, I'm Dr. Gilder.

07:52.127 --> 07:56.017
I'm gonna grab a chart that doesn't
say "Elliot has slammin' tushie" on it.

07:58.373 --> 08:01.314
Much better. And now, Mr. Swick...
This one's got it too.

08:01.564 --> 08:04.525
- Is her butt that nice?
- It's okay for a white chick.

08:05.999 --> 08:08.112
Anyway, I want you to tell
me how you poisoned yourself.

08:08.432 --> 08:10.198
- I can't.
- Why not?

08:10.448 --> 08:12.110
Because you're not my doctor.

08:12.230 --> 08:14.837
You may sound like him
and you look exactly like him.

08:14.957 --> 08:16.206
But you're not him.

08:16.768 --> 08:17.868
Excuse me.

08:19.130 --> 08:20.652
Alright thanks, Dr. Paulson.

08:21.507 --> 08:22.189
So...

08:22.309 --> 08:25.847
The staff shrink says that
Mr. Swick has Capgras syndrome.

08:25.967 --> 08:27.217
It's a brain disorder.

08:27.337 --> 08:29.884
Basically, he thinks everyone
in his life has been replaced

08:30.004 --> 08:31.432
by an identical impostor.

08:31.552 --> 08:33.017
That's wicked cool.

08:33.136 --> 08:34.134
I know, dude!

08:34.254 --> 08:38.017
If we sent the twins from radiology
in there, his brain would explode.

08:38.572 --> 08:39.559
Still,

08:39.809 --> 08:43.322
I think it's more important that
we try and figure out what he ingested.

08:43.787 --> 08:46.067
You know?
So he doesn't die.

08:46.317 --> 08:47.777
Yeah, fine.

08:49.515 --> 08:51.415
Hey Katie, how is it going?

08:52.438 --> 08:54.138
Doing great over here.

08:55.146 --> 08:58.529
It's hard to believe that we were
interns eight years ago, you know.

08:59.802 --> 09:00.802
What?

09:01.090 --> 09:01.995
Oh sorry.

09:02.115 --> 09:05.301
My patient has really got into my head
so I'm looking over her case history.

09:05.523 --> 09:07.805
That's crazy boring to me.
So you know what I'm gonna do?

09:07.925 --> 09:09.929
I'm gonna just
continue my conversation.

09:10.049 --> 09:11.931
All the signs point to anorexia.

09:12.051 --> 09:13.678
Do you like being a doctor?

09:13.928 --> 09:15.721
I just want to believe her.

09:15.971 --> 09:17.571
I love being a doctor.

09:17.882 --> 09:20.856
It's not like all of those other jobs
where you just sit on your ass all day.

09:20.976 --> 09:22.899
You actually get to do things.

09:23.443 --> 09:26.424
Okay, Mrs. Emmett. There's gonna be
a little discomfort from the needle.

09:26.591 --> 09:27.680
but not too much.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.610
Prepare to witness perfection.

09:29.860 --> 09:31.320
Did you really just say that?

09:31.853 --> 09:34.263
I also like that doctors
get to think on their feet.

09:34.383 --> 09:37.380
I want to commend you for not
disclosing what you ingested before

09:37.500 --> 09:38.702
because well,

09:38.822 --> 09:40.746
you were actually
talking to my impostor.

09:40.996 --> 09:41.998
I knew it.

09:42.248 --> 09:44.387
I'm impressed cause
the differences are subtle.

09:44.507 --> 09:46.165
His voice sounds like this.

09:46.332 --> 09:49.213
- And my voice sounds like this.
- I heard it.

09:49.681 --> 09:53.279
Anyway, what don't you just tell me
what you took before he comes back?

09:54.918 --> 09:57.722
I tricked his ass!
Someone give me some!

09:58.053 --> 10:00.227
Look, I came from home
because I couldn't sleep.

10:00.394 --> 10:03.215
I've decided I'm not comfortable
with you giving high fives.

10:03.335 --> 10:04.692
Even when I'm not here.

10:04.812 --> 10:06.692
But I just totally nailed a diagnosis.

10:07.089 --> 10:09.719
The fact that I'm not making a
tremendous sex joke right now

10:09.839 --> 10:13.179
about who or what I nailed tonight
should tell you how serious I am.

10:14.508 --> 10:17.385
I'm spending so much time
focusing on Robyn's past

10:17.505 --> 10:18.895
I'm prejudicing myself.

10:19.015 --> 10:21.729
If I just looked at her
admission form from this morning...

10:21.896 --> 10:23.941
"Young woman who has
undergone a drastic weight loss

10:24.061 --> 10:26.061
even though she says
she's been eating."

10:27.677 --> 10:29.545
I know exactly what to look for.

10:30.342 --> 10:33.007
Handle your business.
I'll go check on the interns.

10:39.903 --> 10:41.537
Katie, no.

10:42.082 --> 10:44.584
- But it works.
- I said no!

10:44.897 --> 10:46.147
He's human.

10:49.670 --> 10:51.734
- We got blast off here?
- Nothing yet.

10:54.989 --> 10:56.702
Give me some good news.
I need a win.

10:56.822 --> 10:58.528
He overdosed on acetaminophen.

10:58.867 --> 10:59.742
Here we go.

11:02.579 --> 11:04.585
- Everything all good in here?
- You know it.

11:05.831 --> 11:08.669
But I'm getting some bubbles
coming out with the fluid.

11:08.789 --> 11:10.783
- Is that supposed to happen?
- No.

11:11.591 --> 11:13.413
Step back, please. Thank you.

11:13.944 --> 11:17.260
Mrs. Emmett, I need you to hold still.
You might have a collapsed lung.

11:17.545 --> 11:19.011
Quick, tell him that's impossible

11:19.131 --> 11:21.419
cause you're the greatest
doctor in the world.

11:26.412 --> 11:28.175
The troops are one for four.

11:28.295 --> 11:29.799
How is it going over here?

11:30.588 --> 11:31.672
Not great.

11:31.839 --> 11:33.734
Robyn is HIV-positive.

11:36.460 --> 11:37.483
That sucks.

11:46.563 --> 11:48.912
When she wakes up,
I have to tell her.

11:49.836 --> 11:51.989
Elliot, maybe it won't be so bad.

11:52.156 --> 11:54.595
You know, we made a lot
of headway with HIV.

11:54.762 --> 11:56.549
It's not a death sentence anymore.

11:57.235 --> 11:58.834
Check on Mr. Maller over here.

11:59.102 --> 12:01.324
He found out he was
HIV-positive today.

12:04.101 --> 12:06.030
Admittedly, he's not
psyched about that.

12:06.150 --> 12:08.264
He's actually watching
sports on his computer.

12:09.228 --> 12:12.540
My point is maybe it won't be that hard
telling Robyn she has the "hivy".

12:13.597 --> 12:14.609
Hivy?

12:14.906 --> 12:17.452
I heard somebody say it
and I thought I was kinda cool.

12:17.920 --> 12:20.329
Sounds like a dance
the kids do nowadays.

12:20.871 --> 12:23.200
Do the hivy, do the hivy...

12:25.924 --> 12:26.924
Like this?

12:27.971 --> 12:29.146
Bring it down.

12:30.877 --> 12:31.877
Here it is.

12:32.232 --> 12:35.053
- I like when you do the hivy.
- We should not do the hivy!

12:37.720 --> 12:39.259
Do the hivy...

12:42.560 --> 12:44.771
Mrs. Emmett, we can't
drain the fluid in your chest

12:44.891 --> 12:47.058
until we repair your collapsed lung.

12:47.588 --> 12:49.268
How did I get a collapsed lung?

12:49.764 --> 12:52.715
That happened when
I tried to drain the fluid.

12:53.139 --> 12:54.074
I'm sorry.

12:54.342 --> 12:56.104
Okay but when it's fixed,

12:56.224 --> 12:58.944
I want the procedure
to be done by a real doctor.

13:02.831 --> 13:05.065
So how long is it before
you become a real doctor?

13:05.185 --> 13:06.323
Is it soon?

13:06.443 --> 13:07.850
Back off, okay?

13:08.286 --> 13:11.248
Come on, when you act all hurt,
it ruins all the fun for me.

13:13.149 --> 13:14.384
Anything?

13:18.113 --> 13:20.741
Mrs. Powell, when I was a kid,
my mom used to tell me

13:20.861 --> 13:23.718
that farts were demons that were
crawling around in your belly

13:23.838 --> 13:26.644
and if I ever let one out,
it would give my grandma cancer.

13:26.764 --> 13:28.891
So I know what you're going through.

13:30.105 --> 13:31.903
But let me tell you
the real issue here.

13:32.023 --> 13:34.401
The number one killer
in hospitals is infection.

13:34.568 --> 13:37.819
And since you just underwent
surgery, you're very susceptible.

13:38.256 --> 13:41.493
We need to get you out of here,
but we can't until you do it so...

13:42.534 --> 13:43.754
It's up to you.

13:49.656 --> 13:52.048
I'm so sorry we have
to strap your arms down.

13:52.168 --> 13:54.030
Please know I'm just trying to help.

13:56.215 --> 13:57.320
Hey Katie.

13:57.575 --> 13:59.232
I can't really talk right now.

14:00.843 --> 14:02.800
Looks like someone got
her first face spitting.

14:03.377 --> 14:06.073
See, there's a lot of things
to hate about being a doctor.

14:06.336 --> 14:08.483
For starters, no women
looks good in scrubs.

14:08.603 --> 14:10.298
But guys do. It's unfair.

14:10.418 --> 14:13.310
Plus, malpractice insurance,
bad hours...

14:13.560 --> 14:16.909
Yeah, but at least you guys
in medicine get to figure stuff out.

14:17.225 --> 14:19.764
You were like a detective
with your HIV patient.

14:20.394 --> 14:22.336
Surgeons, all we do is cut and sew.

14:22.456 --> 14:24.820
Sometimes I feel
like a glorified mechanic.

14:29.516 --> 14:30.429
Well...

14:30.994 --> 14:33.553
Spleen is shot to hell.
I'm gonna have to remove it.

14:33.673 --> 14:36.069
While I'm in there, I might as well
get that gall bladder too.

14:36.189 --> 14:39.860
You can leave it in there but... Just
gonna be back in a couple of months.

14:41.710 --> 14:45.561
To be honest with you, I ain't do
great with those "japonese" models.

14:49.147 --> 14:50.686
I'd look good in a jumpsuit.

14:50.806 --> 14:53.894
If you fantasize like JD, you have to
talk like him when you come out of it.

14:54.014 --> 14:56.266
I'd look good in it, in a jumpsuit.

14:57.040 --> 14:58.522
- Better.
- Thank you.

14:58.784 --> 15:01.032
Gotta tell you what else
I don't like about being a doctor.

15:01.152 --> 15:03.741
The patients.
Sometimes they're great.

15:03.861 --> 15:06.633
But sometimes, like you said,
they just lie through their teeth.

15:06.753 --> 15:10.999
Guzzle this Mucomyst to counteract the
effects of the acetaminophen overdose.

15:11.119 --> 15:12.747
It wasn't acetaminophen.

15:12.867 --> 15:15.133
There was a guy in here
before pretending to be you,

15:15.253 --> 15:17.437
so I lied to him
to throw him off the trail.

15:17.871 --> 15:19.433
Dude, you're killing me!

15:22.045 --> 15:24.495
I think the only way I got
through my first year here

15:24.615 --> 15:26.446
was leaning on
the people around me.

15:26.566 --> 15:28.794
You know how you found
Carla and I found JD?

15:29.291 --> 15:32.448
You ever think how weird it would've
been if you and I found each other?

15:32.775 --> 15:33.748
Elliot...

15:34.300 --> 15:35.757
You're very cute,

15:36.018 --> 15:37.896
but your booty is really tiny,

15:38.016 --> 15:39.944
I don't know what
I would do with that thing.

15:40.064 --> 15:42.399
You could start by smacking it.

15:42.993 --> 15:44.031
And secondly,

15:44.151 --> 15:45.961
if we were in a committed relationship,

15:46.081 --> 15:48.989
I'd have gained like
30 to 40 pounds for you.

15:49.392 --> 15:50.837
- Really?
- No.

15:51.116 --> 15:53.333
Still this place could
use some jungle fever.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.863
<i>The whole white doctor
black surgeon thing.</i>

15:58.800 --> 16:01.287
Wait, wait.
Why is this happening?

16:01.556 --> 16:04.424
That whole pathetic no self-esteem
thing you have going on right now...

16:04.544 --> 16:06.804
I'm really vibing that. That's why
I used to date fat guys.

16:06.924 --> 16:09.447
The reason why I work my body
so much now is cause I was...

16:09.567 --> 16:10.890
kind of a heavy kid.

16:11.010 --> 16:12.732
- How heavy?
- 260.

16:13.297 --> 16:14.138
Oh god.

16:15.804 --> 16:18.995
We're acting all nostalgic,
but we're barely in our thirties.

16:19.162 --> 16:21.527
We could still do anything
we want with our lives.

16:21.647 --> 16:23.861
You don't think we'll
both be doctors forever?

16:24.242 --> 16:26.485
Dr Reid, your patient Robyn is up.

16:27.058 --> 16:28.058
Great.

16:28.579 --> 16:29.828
Here goes.

16:30.864 --> 16:34.159
Also, I got Mr. Swick to admit
he actually ate fertilizer.

16:34.409 --> 16:37.377
- How did you do that?
- I may have given him a little slap.

16:37.854 --> 16:39.139
You'll do fine here.

16:49.237 --> 16:50.175
It's done.

16:50.719 --> 16:53.262
Just me being a guy,
I have to ask this question.

16:53.514 --> 16:56.325
- What did it smell like?
- 30 years of repression.

16:57.449 --> 16:58.565
And hot dogs.

16:59.081 --> 17:00.006
Good job.

17:03.067 --> 17:04.607
I'm HIV-positive?

17:05.220 --> 17:07.901
You were right.
It's not anorexia.

17:08.339 --> 17:09.924
Wow, that's a...

17:10.393 --> 17:12.406
Huge victory for me.

17:12.857 --> 17:15.367
I know it's scary to even
be talking about the "hivy".

17:15.599 --> 17:16.441
The what?

17:16.560 --> 17:18.653
I'm sorry, forget it.
I'm just really nervous.

17:18.772 --> 17:21.663
The point is,
HIV is very treatable now.

17:21.971 --> 17:23.935
This does not have to ruin your life.

17:24.271 --> 17:27.046
So I should just... stay positive?

17:27.528 --> 17:28.546
Definitely.

17:28.884 --> 17:29.968
Because...

17:30.285 --> 17:34.259
Even though I really want
to get married and have kids,

17:34.426 --> 17:37.533
this will probably make it easier...

17:38.284 --> 17:39.600
to find someone.

17:43.313 --> 17:45.413
Don't try to make this okay.

17:46.603 --> 17:48.590
This is not okay.

17:49.465 --> 17:52.741
This is the worse thing that's ever
gonna happen to me in my entire life.

17:54.474 --> 17:56.312
And you're here to see it so...

17:57.021 --> 17:59.376
you need to find
a way to handle it better.

17:59.496 --> 18:02.164
Cause I get to
handle it however I want.

18:04.548 --> 18:06.132
Do you want me to shut up?

18:08.764 --> 18:10.238
Do you want me to leave?

18:35.373 --> 18:38.235
Here. Sorry about the
guy spitting in your face.

18:38.535 --> 18:39.698
Thanks, Howie.

18:40.146 --> 18:41.488
You smell horrible.

18:42.437 --> 18:46.061
I showered three times and I can't
get Mrs. Powell's stink off me.

18:46.904 --> 18:48.623
It's in my hair.

18:49.961 --> 18:51.437
Where have you two been?

18:51.768 --> 18:53.527
- Nowhere.
- We weren't anywhere.

18:54.040 --> 18:55.041
What smells?

18:55.534 --> 18:58.545
I'm going to go take
a bath in tomato juice.

18:59.986 --> 19:01.391
Look at that.

19:02.581 --> 19:04.601
They have no idea
what's ahead of them.

19:07.527 --> 19:10.163
You know, I never
answered your question earlier

19:10.283 --> 19:12.936
about whether you and I
would always be doctors.

19:13.188 --> 19:13.986
You will.

19:15.946 --> 19:20.470
You have this amazing ability
to find joy in everything you do.

19:21.312 --> 19:22.327
Thank you.

19:22.697 --> 19:25.630
Whether it's like an operation
you've done a hundred times,

19:26.556 --> 19:28.047
<i>or even teaching.</i>

19:28.396 --> 19:32.036
Alright, the trick to this is to get
the needle right between the ribs, okay?

19:32.383 --> 19:33.919
Watch. Like...

19:35.007 --> 19:36.007
so.

19:40.008 --> 19:41.942
- Nice.
- You wanna get it for me?

19:44.237 --> 19:45.953
But as for me,

19:46.993 --> 19:50.572
I know you think it was a big victory
figuring out what was wrong with Robyn.

19:52.631 --> 19:56.420
But those moments are kind of
like eating a piece of chocolate.

19:58.618 --> 20:02.426
<i>I enjoy the satisfaction for about
ten seconds and then it's gone.</i>

20:03.591 --> 20:04.384
<i>See...</i>

20:04.504 --> 20:07.870
<i>The thing that sticks with me
is the anguish on a patient's face</i>

20:07.990 --> 20:12.022
<i>when I give them crappy news.
I hold on to that forever.</i>

20:13.770 --> 20:16.526
<i>You're a surgeon,
you occasionally get to fix people.</i>

20:16.646 --> 20:20.471
<i>I figure out what's wrong and then most
of the time I can't do anything about it.</i>

20:20.638 --> 20:23.032
<i>I just wish them luck
dealing with it...</i>

20:23.395 --> 20:26.242
<i>or try to keep them
alive for a while longer.</i>

20:26.362 --> 20:29.025
<i>So you wanna know
if I'll always be a doctor?</i>

20:29.432 --> 20:31.570
<i>I'd have to say, I don't know.</i>

20:31.737 --> 20:34.415
<i>I'm a doctor now,
I will be tomorrow.</i>

20:35.243 --> 20:38.618
<i>But I can't tell you that if I'm
ever lucky enough to get married,</i>

20:38.932 --> 20:40.468
<i>to have some kids,</i>

20:40.708 --> 20:42.866
<i>to maybe not need the money,</i>

20:44.508 --> 20:47.309
<i>I think I'd walk out of here
and never look back.</i>

20:56.249 --> 20:58.297
But how am I supposed
to express my joy?

20:58.417 --> 21:00.374
{\pos(192,220)}Dude, you gotta find your own thing.

21:00.636 --> 21:03.637
{\pos(192,220)}I'd tell you to do the low arm pump,
but Dr. Fordham owns that.

21:03.757 --> 21:05.224
{\pos(192,220)}Here's the coffee you wanted.

21:07.882 --> 21:09.685
{\pos(192,200)}Deb, relax. It's just coffee.

21:12.761 --> 21:15.319
{\pos(192,210)}Don't tell her there's
donuts in the break room.

21:15.439 --> 21:16.602
{\pos(192,210)}We have donuts?

21:22.562 --> 21:23.562
{\pos(192,180)}Anyway.
