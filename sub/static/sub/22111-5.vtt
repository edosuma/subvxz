00:04.272 --> 00:08.242
("Everybody's Talkin'"
by Nilsson playing)

00:08.276 --> 00:10.811
* Everybody's talkin' at me...

00:10.844 --> 00:13.347
PHILLIP:
I don't know what to tell you.

00:13.381 --> 00:15.216
I lost an hour
of my life listening

00:15.249 --> 00:17.251
to the kid rank
his favorite I.P.A.s.

00:17.285 --> 00:19.087
SOKOLOV (over phone):
Does he have a job?

00:19.120 --> 00:21.422
Does brewing beer
in a bathtub count?

00:21.455 --> 00:24.125
(engine revving)

00:24.158 --> 00:26.094
Maybe he has a good family.

00:26.127 --> 00:28.162
PHILLIP:
Honestly,

00:28.196 --> 00:29.563
I'm afraid to ask.

00:29.597 --> 00:31.565
You have my condolences.

00:31.599 --> 00:33.601
You're lucky
you don't have a daughter.

00:33.634 --> 00:35.236
* Of their eyes...

00:35.269 --> 00:39.173
So, to what do I owe
the pleasure?

00:39.207 --> 00:41.509
Why do you have to hurt
my feelings like that?

00:41.542 --> 00:42.843
(tires screeching)

00:42.876 --> 00:44.845
We are just talking
'cause we are friends.

00:44.878 --> 00:47.381
Ha. Sure.

00:47.415 --> 00:50.584
Always work with you Americans.

00:50.618 --> 00:52.753
Fine.

00:52.786 --> 00:54.622
I want to visit Mountebank.

00:54.655 --> 00:55.823
I hear it's
a lovely little town.

00:55.856 --> 00:57.291
(sighs)

00:57.325 --> 00:59.360
Look, I already told you...

00:59.393 --> 01:00.394
I know what you told me.

01:00.428 --> 01:01.795
I don't care.

01:01.829 --> 01:03.864
Damn it.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.799
Come on.

01:05.833 --> 01:07.601
Don't be such a little bitch.

01:07.635 --> 01:09.737
(horn honking)
Oh, gee...

01:12.473 --> 01:14.108
(panting)

01:16.444 --> 01:17.578
Phillip?

01:17.611 --> 01:19.513
Are you still there?

01:19.547 --> 01:21.815
Yeah, I'm here.

01:21.849 --> 01:25.586
You heard Mountebank
is a lovely little town.

01:25.619 --> 01:27.821
I don't care what you think.

01:27.855 --> 01:30.358
You are a good friend.

01:30.391 --> 01:31.625
(engine approaching)

01:35.529 --> 01:37.531
(car crashes)

01:41.169 --> 01:42.370
PHILLIP (over recording):
Yeah, I'm here.

01:42.403 --> 01:46.140
You heard Mountebank
is a lovely little town.

01:46.174 --> 01:48.276
SOKOLOV:
I don't care what you think.

01:48.309 --> 01:49.277
You are a good friend.

01:49.310 --> 01:50.811
(car crashes)

01:50.844 --> 01:53.381
Sir.

01:53.414 --> 01:54.882
I have something.

01:56.550 --> 01:58.752
*

02:17.905 --> 02:19.740
Whoa.
How you doing, Nell?

02:19.773 --> 02:22.876
Hi, Callen. Why do you
appear to be stalking me?

02:22.910 --> 02:25.213
I think someone's
stealing my identity.

02:25.246 --> 02:26.714
You "think"?
Well, I know.

02:26.747 --> 02:28.582
Somebody opened
a credit card under my name.

02:28.616 --> 02:30.918
Okay, could it have been,
I don't know, Anna?

02:30.951 --> 02:33.354
Mm, Anna and I are not really
at the credit card sharing point

02:33.387 --> 02:35.589
in our relationship.
Not even close.

02:35.623 --> 02:37.958
It wasn't actually my name,
per se, it was, uh...

02:37.991 --> 02:40.394
Dexter's.

02:40.428 --> 02:41.695
(laughs softly)

02:41.729 --> 02:43.231
What do you have against Dexter?

02:43.264 --> 02:44.965
Dexter is the absolute worst.

02:44.998 --> 02:47.735
He's this finance/tech poseur.

02:47.768 --> 02:49.537
He's cocky, smug.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.205
The picture of white privilege.

02:51.239 --> 02:52.440
Don't look at me.

02:52.473 --> 02:54.542
Dexter is an alias, okay?
He is a persona.

02:54.575 --> 02:56.877
Of your own creation.

02:56.910 --> 02:58.612
Just go through the cases
where Dexter was active.

02:58.646 --> 02:59.880
See if there's
any connection between

02:59.913 --> 03:01.582
the new credit card charges.
It may just be

03:01.615 --> 03:02.716
routine identity theft.

03:02.750 --> 03:05.886
Yes. But given what Sam
just went through, maybe not.

03:05.919 --> 03:07.888
Exactly. Eric.

03:07.921 --> 03:09.590
Let me ask
you something.

03:09.623 --> 03:11.425
What do you think
of Dexter Hughes?

03:11.459 --> 03:13.927
Dexter... Dexter Hughes?

03:13.961 --> 03:15.963
Oh, Would Never Want Him
to Meet My Sister

03:15.996 --> 03:16.997
if I Had a Sister Dexter Hughes?

03:17.030 --> 03:18.799
Ah.

03:18.832 --> 03:21.335
That's what you call him?

03:21.369 --> 03:23.504
Oh, yeah. I'd call him that
to his face.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.005
Well, this is his face.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.640
Okay.

03:26.674 --> 03:30.010
Would Never Want Him to...
Waste His Time.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.445
Because
we have a case.

03:31.479 --> 03:33.914
An urgent case.
Uh, Hidoko's waiting.

03:33.947 --> 03:36.384
Which means Mosley's waiting.

03:38.419 --> 03:41.389
Thank you. Dexter would
never do anything like that.

03:41.422 --> 03:44.292
He just did.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.329
No Kensi and Deeks?

03:48.362 --> 03:49.563
They're already in the field.

03:49.597 --> 03:51.299
There's a Joint
Terrorism Task Force

03:51.332 --> 03:52.466
less than a mile
from their house.

03:52.500 --> 03:53.634
What are the odds, right?

03:53.667 --> 03:55.669
Okay, could we start
from the beginning?

03:55.703 --> 03:57.305
Oh, right.
Of course.

03:57.338 --> 03:59.840
After you.
No, you should go first.

03:59.873 --> 04:01.742
Guys, come on.

04:01.775 --> 04:04.011
The JTTF intercepted
a phone call this morning

04:04.044 --> 04:06.914
between Abram Sokolov,
the notorious

04:06.947 --> 04:09.016
Russian oligarch
sanctioned by the U.S.,

04:09.049 --> 04:11.319
and Phillip Nelson,
a prominent investment banker

04:11.352 --> 04:12.653
here in Los Angeles.

04:12.686 --> 04:14.021
What was the conversation about?

04:14.054 --> 04:15.823
You tell me.

04:15.856 --> 04:18.326
SOKOLOV (over recording):
Always work with you Americans.

04:18.359 --> 04:20.561
Fine.

04:20.594 --> 04:21.829
I want to visit Mountebank.

04:21.862 --> 04:24.665
I hear
it's a lovely little town.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.467
PHILLIP:
Look, I already told you...

04:26.500 --> 04:28.001
SOKOLOV: I know what
you told me. I don't care.

04:28.035 --> 04:32.740
Mountebank. What is that, some
quaint little Swiss ski town?

04:32.773 --> 04:35.776
Sounds like Sokolov's talking
in some sort of code.

04:35.809 --> 04:36.977
Can't be good. Sokolov's
protected by Putin.

04:37.010 --> 04:39.313
He's never been caught,
but everyone knows

04:39.347 --> 04:41.482
he's a skilled smuggler.
Drugs, arms.

04:41.515 --> 04:44.585
Why did the JTTF
turn this over to us?

04:44.618 --> 04:45.686
Nelson's in the Naval Reserves.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.955
Kensi and Deeks are talking
to the task force analyst

04:47.988 --> 04:49.523
that flagged
the conversation now.

04:49.557 --> 04:50.691
CALLEN:
All right.

04:50.724 --> 04:51.959
So Sam and I will
interview Nelson.

04:51.992 --> 04:53.694
HIDOKO: That might be tough.
Nelson took the call

04:53.727 --> 04:54.995
this morning in his car.

04:55.028 --> 04:56.730
Halfway through it,
he was in a hit-and-run

04:56.764 --> 04:58.065
that didn't end so well for him.

04:58.098 --> 05:00.334
ERIC: The accident
happened on Mulholland.

05:00.368 --> 05:02.336
There's no traffic cam footage
of the collision,

05:02.370 --> 05:04.037
but, uh, location's
on your phones.

05:04.071 --> 05:05.706
On our way.

05:05.739 --> 05:07.675
Good luck.

05:07.708 --> 05:10.344
SOKOLOV (over recording):
I don't care what you think.

05:10.378 --> 05:11.512
You are a good friend.

05:11.545 --> 05:12.980
(car crashes)

05:13.013 --> 05:14.515
Huh.
Ouch.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.519
Yes, they're talking in code.

05:18.552 --> 05:20.621
No, I don't know
what any of it means.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.890
No, I've never heard anyone
reference "mountebank" before.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.792
No, neither has anyone
else around here,

05:24.825 --> 05:25.959
and, yes,

05:25.993 --> 05:27.995
I checked twice.
Okay.

05:28.028 --> 05:30.398
So why exactly is this team
listening in

05:30.431 --> 05:31.632
on this conversation?

05:31.665 --> 05:34.802
Well, Abram Sokolov is more
than a mere person of interest.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.904
We haven't been able
to pin him to anything,

05:36.937 --> 05:39.907
but he's been orbiting
a number of our investigations.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.910
So how often is he in contact
with Phillip Nelson?

05:42.943 --> 05:43.977
Now, we've been tracing
Sokolov's phone calls

05:44.011 --> 05:45.178
since early 2014.

05:45.212 --> 05:47.881
This is the first contact
between them that we know of.

05:47.915 --> 05:49.049
But they sound like old pals.

05:49.082 --> 05:50.317
Yeah, I don't think it's a leap

05:50.350 --> 05:52.920
to assume they might have found,
uh, others ways of communication

05:52.953 --> 05:54.087
without us knowing about it.

05:54.121 --> 05:57.090
But to the extent
of our capabilities,

05:57.124 --> 05:59.159
we know that Sokolov
is a regular Chatty Cathy.

05:59.192 --> 06:03.163
He's talking to a lot of
different people all day long.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.898
Mostly about the ponies.

06:04.932 --> 06:07.435
The guy probably gets
four hours of sleep a night.

06:07.468 --> 06:09.403
Oh, so he's part
of the sleepless elite.

06:09.437 --> 06:11.171
What?
You don't know
what the sleepless...?

06:11.204 --> 06:13.173
You? No.
Let me tell you.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.943
So, one to three percent
of the population can survive

06:15.976 --> 06:17.445
on that little sleep.

06:17.478 --> 06:18.712
That's my-- that's my gift
to you two.

06:18.746 --> 06:20.448
KENSI:
Feel free to ignore him.

06:20.481 --> 06:21.915
He's used to it.

06:21.949 --> 06:23.551
No, I guarantee you're gonna
repurpose that nugget.

06:23.584 --> 06:24.985
Good luck.

06:25.018 --> 06:26.186
Yeah, no. We're gonna need it.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.154
Thank you.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.932
What do we know?

06:38.966 --> 06:42.135
That there aren't nearly enough
traffic cams on Mulholland.

06:43.136 --> 06:44.705
Let me guess.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.173
No eyewitnesses.

06:46.206 --> 06:48.108
So the only person
that could identify the driver

06:48.141 --> 06:50.210
is in a body bag
in that coroner's van.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.713
LAPD think it was a hit-and-run?

06:52.746 --> 06:54.147
Well, the working theory
is that the other driver

06:54.181 --> 06:56.149
took advantage of the fact
that there was no one here,

06:56.183 --> 06:57.851
and fled the scene.

06:57.885 --> 07:02.022
Well, simplest explanation
is usually the right one.

07:06.059 --> 07:09.129
Sometimes it's not.

07:09.162 --> 07:12.500
I don't see any skid marks
from the car that hit Nelson.

07:12.533 --> 07:13.834
And Nelson was on the phone
with Sokolov

07:13.867 --> 07:16.570
at the exact moment
he was killed.

07:16.604 --> 07:20.207
You know, your alias,
uh, Dexter Hughes,

07:20.240 --> 07:22.175
travels in the same
finance circles as Nelson.

07:22.209 --> 07:24.512
And your point?

07:24.545 --> 07:27.648
Someone may be trying to
distract you from the case.

07:27.681 --> 07:29.683
Separate the two of us.

07:29.717 --> 07:30.918
You think the two are connected?

07:30.951 --> 07:32.620
How is that even possible?

07:32.653 --> 07:34.655
Last time we thought something
was a coincidence,

07:34.688 --> 07:35.989
look at what happened.

07:36.023 --> 07:37.558
(phone ringing)

07:37.591 --> 07:39.660
Suddenly, this accident
isn't so simple.

07:39.693 --> 07:40.661
Yeah, Eric.

07:40.694 --> 07:42.863
Well, here's the-- I-- oh.
Give me that thing.

07:42.896 --> 07:45.232
Uh...
This is not Eric, this is me.

07:45.265 --> 07:46.767
Assistant Director.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.135
I need to send

07:48.168 --> 07:50.270
someone in undercover
to Nelson's bank.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.640
I need copies of all of
Sokolov's transaction records.

07:52.673 --> 07:54.808
Sam, I want you to go in.

07:54.842 --> 07:56.644
Yeah, we usually decide

07:56.677 --> 07:59.212
as a team which one of us
is gonna go undercover.

07:59.246 --> 08:00.781
"Usually" being
the operative word.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.783
There's a new sheriff, remember?

08:02.816 --> 08:04.852
You make it hard not to.

08:04.885 --> 08:07.688
Excuse me,
Executive Assistant Director.

08:07.721 --> 08:09.623
But the proprietary
traders

08:09.657 --> 08:12.593
at Nelson's bank just started
shorting the markets.

08:12.626 --> 08:15.596
Guys, they're expecting
the stock market to crash.

08:16.263 --> 08:17.297
NELL:
Not only that,

08:17.330 --> 08:19.567
but the bank is betting big.

08:19.600 --> 08:20.400
SAM:
Then it's not a bet.

08:20.433 --> 08:22.703
They must have
inside information.

08:22.736 --> 08:25.072
Something big is gonna happen,
like a terrorist attack.

08:25.105 --> 08:26.306
Something that's gonna
rock the dollar.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.340
Well, it might
also mean that whatever

08:27.374 --> 08:29.309
Sokolov was trying to set
into motion this morning

08:29.342 --> 08:30.277
has already started.

08:30.310 --> 08:31.612
MOSLEY:
Well, you better

08:31.645 --> 08:32.913
find out what that is.

08:32.946 --> 08:34.247
And stop it.

08:46.226 --> 08:48.295
You get ahold of your buddy
who's stationed at Pearl Harbor?

08:48.328 --> 08:49.563
Yeah, he's headed to Kauai.

08:49.597 --> 08:50.764
If Hetty's there,
he'll find her.

08:50.798 --> 08:52.232
If she's just chilling
on the beach,

08:52.265 --> 08:54.134
I don't think she's gonna
appreciate us spying on her.

08:54.167 --> 08:56.336
Hetty doesn't seem like the type
to be chilling on the beach.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.739
But if she is, Hatch
will be discreet.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.008
What's up?
Hey.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.643
What am I walking into?

09:02.676 --> 09:04.011
A very tight ship.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.714
Phillip Nelson's bank,
West Valley Venue,

09:06.747 --> 09:09.583
is a boutique firm
that scales with the big dogs.

09:09.617 --> 09:12.352
So they basically do the same
as J.P. Morgan and Goldman.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.221
Pretty much. Only they do it
from the West Coast,

09:14.254 --> 09:16.256
which makes it
that much more impressive.

09:16.289 --> 09:17.725
CALLEN: All right,
so with Nelson out,

09:17.758 --> 09:19.359
who's steering the ship now?

09:19.392 --> 09:20.828
That would be Leigha Winters.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.362
She assumed control
within an hour

09:22.395 --> 09:23.731
of learning of his death.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.666
Wow, that didn't take long.

09:25.699 --> 09:26.900
Well, money never sleeps.

09:26.934 --> 09:28.368
So Leigha's
who I'm interviewing with?

09:28.401 --> 09:29.502
That is the hope.

09:29.536 --> 09:31.705
Though you will need to go
through the initial rounds

09:31.739 --> 09:32.806
with her
junior associates first.

09:32.840 --> 09:35.676
Full disclosure, they were not
looking for a new hire,

09:35.709 --> 09:39.747
but you submitted
a very persuasive cover letter.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.749
You up for this?

09:41.782 --> 09:42.616
Please. I've been reading

09:42.650 --> 09:44.652
The Wall Street Journal
since I was 12.

09:44.685 --> 09:46.386
I know my way around
discounted cash flow statements

09:46.419 --> 09:48.221
like I do my own house.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.858
You know you live on
a boat now, right?

09:53.360 --> 09:55.696
Is my alias backstopped?

09:55.729 --> 09:58.999
Oh, Eric took good care
of you, Mr. Trevor Ward.

09:59.032 --> 10:01.635
You spent the last five years
working the equities desk

10:01.669 --> 10:03.871
at a firm in Chicago.

10:03.904 --> 10:06.406
Just in case, take Hidoko
with you on overwatch.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.607
Hold on a second.

10:07.641 --> 10:10.811
One of your identities has been
compromised, Agent Callen.

10:14.114 --> 10:16.784
It's a possibility.

10:16.817 --> 10:18.185
And I'm not willing to
risk Agent Hanna's safety

10:18.218 --> 10:20.688
on that possibility. Are you?

10:20.721 --> 10:22.055
Can I have a say in this?

10:22.089 --> 10:24.692
Because I'm fine
with Callen backing me up.

10:24.725 --> 10:25.859
Well, then, I guess
it's a good thing

10:25.893 --> 10:27.695
I'm looking out
for both of you, huh?

10:27.728 --> 10:28.929
Let's talk.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.964
Good luck.

10:30.998 --> 10:32.132
Don't need it.

10:32.165 --> 10:34.167
That's the beauty of math.

10:38.706 --> 10:41.341
Still no office yet, huh?

10:41.374 --> 10:43.911
It'll be worth the wait.

10:43.944 --> 10:45.813
Agent Callen,
do you truly believe

10:45.846 --> 10:48.081
the compromise of your alias,
Dexter Hughes,

10:48.115 --> 10:49.817
poses no threat
to this operation

10:49.850 --> 10:50.784
and its personnel?

10:50.818 --> 10:53.754
I take every precaution
with my undercovers.

10:53.787 --> 10:55.689
I'm sure you do.

10:55.723 --> 10:56.656
But that doesn't
change my position.

10:56.690 --> 10:58.458
And you still haven't
given me an answer.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.293
Because I don't have one yet.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.129
But know that I am working
this case with both eyes open.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.831
We all are.

11:03.864 --> 11:06.466
You know, I'd prefer
to have you backing up Sam,

11:06.499 --> 11:09.737
but I can't do that
until your alias is secure.

11:09.770 --> 11:11.739
Are we on the same page?

11:11.772 --> 11:13.741
(chuckles) Honestly,

11:13.774 --> 11:15.743
I'm not sure we're even
reading the same book.

11:18.145 --> 11:19.346
(sighs)

11:23.016 --> 11:24.852
Hey.

11:27.855 --> 11:28.989
Why did you tell Mosley?

11:29.022 --> 11:31.825
I didn't tell Mosley anything.

11:31.859 --> 11:33.927
Then how did she know
that my Dexter Hughes alias

11:33.961 --> 11:35.128
was compromised?

11:35.162 --> 11:37.497
How did Hetty know
the things that she did?

11:37.530 --> 11:39.466
Or Granger, for that matter.

11:39.499 --> 11:43.136
I don't know, maybe they implant
some special chip in your brain

11:43.170 --> 11:45.272
when you become senior
management at NCIS.

11:45.305 --> 11:47.775
But I promise you
it wasn't me.

11:47.808 --> 11:51.211
(sighs)
Okay.

11:51.244 --> 11:57.785
Now, on a separate but related
note, I found something.

11:57.818 --> 11:59.319
There's an apartment that
was rented yesterday

11:59.352 --> 12:01.154
in Santa Monica
to a Dexter Hughes.

12:01.188 --> 12:03.356
Can you send me the address?

12:03.390 --> 12:04.792
Oh, I already did.

12:04.825 --> 12:05.926
Thank you.

12:05.959 --> 12:07.027
You're welcome.

12:07.060 --> 12:10.163
Just doing what I do.

12:11.832 --> 12:13.466
(clears throat)

12:13.500 --> 12:14.902
You guys need something?

12:14.935 --> 12:17.270
We know a guy.
What kind of guy?

12:17.304 --> 12:20.140
A Russian guy.
Big-time Russian guy.

12:20.173 --> 12:21.909
Is there any scenario
where this

12:21.942 --> 12:24.444
big-time Russian guy compromises
the integrity of this case?

12:24.477 --> 12:25.445
Yes.
Big-time.

12:25.478 --> 12:26.479
Big-time?

12:26.513 --> 12:27.848
But you still think

12:27.881 --> 12:29.182
he's additive
to the investigation?

12:29.216 --> 12:30.550
Possibly.

12:30.583 --> 12:31.751
There's a chance.
A slight chance.

12:31.785 --> 12:33.887
I mean, first, you don't think
he's helping you, and then

12:33.921 --> 12:35.789
you think that maybe he's trying
to get you killed, but then you

12:35.823 --> 12:38.125
realize he's just causing you
to go prematurely gray,

12:38.158 --> 12:39.893
causing some late-night
stress-eating,

12:39.927 --> 12:40.794
but he has legit inroads

12:40.828 --> 12:43.363
to an unbelievable
amount of bad guys.

12:43.396 --> 12:44.564
Because say
what you will about him,

12:44.597 --> 12:47.000
he is a charming bastard
and a people person.

12:47.034 --> 12:49.903
As long as those people are
on the wrong side of the law.

12:49.937 --> 12:52.072
Are we talking about
Arkady Kolcheck?

12:52.105 --> 12:54.374
You know him?
No,

12:54.407 --> 12:56.176
I don't know him, but I've been
reading your case files.

12:56.209 --> 12:59.446
And I do have my concerns
about Callen's connection

12:59.479 --> 13:02.415
to a Russian with
a questionable past,

13:02.449 --> 13:05.352
not to mention his romantic
relationship with his daughter.

13:05.385 --> 13:07.554
Well, I can assure you that
neither one of us

13:07.587 --> 13:10.057
have a romantic relationship
with Arkady

13:10.090 --> 13:13.827
or his daughter, and Callen
will not be coming with us.

13:13.861 --> 13:15.896
Go and speak to Arkady.

13:15.929 --> 13:17.865
And keep your wits about you.

13:17.898 --> 13:19.132
He'll try.
Done.

13:23.570 --> 13:26.406
Trevor, my man.

13:26.439 --> 13:27.841
Keith.

13:27.875 --> 13:29.209
Nice to meet you, Keith.

13:29.242 --> 13:31.478
I've heard a lot of great
things, great things.

13:31.511 --> 13:32.946
Word is,

13:32.980 --> 13:34.614
they call you Nimbo,

13:34.647 --> 13:37.918
short for Nimbostratus because
you're such a damn rainmaker!

13:37.951 --> 13:39.119
That's why.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.922
It's nice to finally
meet you, too.

13:41.955 --> 13:43.623
We have a great
culture here.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.459
Totally inclusive, obviously.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.328
I'd expect nothing less.

13:48.361 --> 13:49.496
Even though I'm

13:49.529 --> 13:51.932
one of the only women
at the firm,

13:51.965 --> 13:54.001
I have a seat
at every negotiation,

13:54.034 --> 13:55.635
every closing dinner.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.570
And every lap dance.

13:57.604 --> 13:59.239
I get to sit through

13:59.272 --> 14:01.141
every lap dance.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.244
Wow.

14:04.277 --> 14:06.980
I'd never be able
to bear witness

14:07.014 --> 14:11.351
to the things I do here if
I were literally anywhere else.

14:11.384 --> 14:15.255
Well, thank you
for your honesty.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.658
You have any questions
you want to ask me?

14:18.691 --> 14:20.327
VICTOR:
All right, Trevor.

14:20.360 --> 14:23.897
Find the error
in this model.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.269
No rush.

14:29.302 --> 14:31.238
People make mistakes
when they rush.

14:31.271 --> 14:33.406
They get sloppy.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.042
But not you.

14:36.109 --> 14:37.344
This is your model.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.046
Perhaps.

14:39.079 --> 14:40.914
Oh, no, it is.

14:40.948 --> 14:43.016
'Cause there are no errors.
None.

14:43.050 --> 14:45.618
Technically.

14:45.652 --> 14:47.187
Although it's not as elegant
as it could've been.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.957
I would've created
a V-look-up table and...

14:49.990 --> 14:51.558
added a little
sensitivity analysis

14:51.591 --> 14:52.559
to run different scenarios.

14:52.592 --> 14:55.195
You could've laid
a simple macro

14:55.228 --> 14:57.097
over the top
to automate the whole thing.

14:57.130 --> 14:58.298
But this is really good.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.333
You did a great job.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.535
Good work.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.304
Really good.

15:07.374 --> 15:09.442
I'll check if Leigha
is ready to see you now.

15:09.476 --> 15:11.344
Thank you.
Hey, it's been a pleasure.

15:13.981 --> 15:15.082
Nice meeting you.

15:17.017 --> 15:19.052
HIDOKO:
Tell me, Sam,

15:19.086 --> 15:23.090
just between you and me, how
much of that was you bluffing?

15:23.123 --> 15:24.958
Hidoko.

15:24.992 --> 15:26.526
It's a fair question.

15:26.559 --> 15:28.095
(sighs)
I don't bluff.

15:28.128 --> 15:30.097
Especially when
it comes to math.

15:30.130 --> 15:32.632
That is good to know.

15:44.211 --> 15:46.213
*

16:11.804 --> 16:14.007
*

16:36.363 --> 16:37.530
LEIGHA:
Trevor.

16:37.564 --> 16:39.799
Leigha Winters.
How are you?

16:39.832 --> 16:42.735
Good. Well,
you're already up.

16:42.769 --> 16:45.772
Let's do this
on our feet.

16:45.805 --> 16:47.407
Keith tells me
you look the part.

16:47.440 --> 16:48.808
(chuckles)

16:48.841 --> 16:53.113
Jen says you won't cause any
problems for HR, and Victor...

16:53.146 --> 16:57.150
well, I saw Victor shed a tear
over your Excel chops.

16:57.184 --> 16:59.819
But I want to know is
why you think

16:59.852 --> 17:01.454
you should be
my number two.

17:01.488 --> 17:06.093
Ah, well, I have the skills
to open my own shop,

17:06.126 --> 17:07.260
but I like
having a partner.

17:07.294 --> 17:08.695
I like having someone
at my back,

17:08.728 --> 17:09.796
and I like being there
for someone else.

17:09.829 --> 17:13.266
And what makes you think
I need that kind of support?

17:13.300 --> 17:14.834
Well, you shorted the
market three hours after

17:14.867 --> 17:15.735
you took reigns
of this place.

17:15.768 --> 17:18.471
You're not afraid
to take big swings.

17:18.505 --> 17:21.374
You're gonna need someone
to look out for you.

17:21.408 --> 17:23.476
And you think you're
just the man for the job.

17:23.510 --> 17:25.112
I know I am.

17:25.145 --> 17:26.779
(knocking on door)

17:26.813 --> 17:30.117
DEEKS: Arkady!
What? What, what?

17:30.150 --> 17:32.152
What? Ay-ay-ay.
I'm coming.

17:32.185 --> 17:33.720
(knocking continues)

17:33.753 --> 17:35.088
Enough already.

17:35.122 --> 17:36.623
It's not even 8:00.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.625
It's past 11:00.

17:38.658 --> 17:39.859
Yeah, on Sunday.

17:39.892 --> 17:42.429
Mm.
Or a Monday, as
the case may be.

17:42.462 --> 17:45.465
I cannot deal with you people
until I've had something to eat.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.367
* We believe
in the Mashed Potato *

17:47.400 --> 17:49.102
Coffee.

17:49.136 --> 17:50.370
It's transitional weather,

17:50.403 --> 17:53.473
so I didn't know if you
wanted iced or hot.

17:53.506 --> 17:56.509
* Loose booty...

17:56.543 --> 17:59.412
I don't even know why I stuck
my big, fat neck out.

17:59.446 --> 18:01.481
Ever. Huh? (grunts)

18:01.514 --> 18:03.350
Ay.

18:03.383 --> 18:04.551
Thanks.

18:07.554 --> 18:08.688
* Loose booty...

18:08.721 --> 18:11.424
Girls, girls.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.260
Go inside. Play Ping-Pong.

18:14.694 --> 18:16.596
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

18:16.629 --> 18:17.764
Hey, uh...

18:17.797 --> 18:19.399
My nieces are in town.

18:19.432 --> 18:20.600
Ah...
Ah...

18:20.633 --> 18:21.868
So...

18:21.901 --> 18:23.603
what is it now?

18:23.636 --> 18:25.238
Abram Sokolov.

18:25.272 --> 18:27.540
Listen.

18:27.574 --> 18:29.176
I act like I don't like you,

18:29.209 --> 18:30.910
but I actually care
deeply for you.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.213
Sometimes when I am blowing out

18:33.246 --> 18:34.781
my birthday candles,

18:34.814 --> 18:37.550
I am imagining that you
are my daughter and not Anna.

18:37.584 --> 18:39.552
But please,
don't tell her

18:39.586 --> 18:41.888
I said that.
She would take it wrong way.

18:41.921 --> 18:44.157
I care less so for you.

18:44.191 --> 18:45.124
That's fine.

18:45.158 --> 18:47.927
But stay as far away
from Sokolov as you can.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.862
My rule of thumb is

18:49.896 --> 18:51.531
at least one continent.

18:51.564 --> 18:52.665
Well, that may not
be possible.

18:52.699 --> 18:54.334
Because Sam just got
a job at the bank

18:54.367 --> 18:55.635
that we think is
doing work for Sokolov.

18:55.668 --> 18:57.170
He's already in there.

18:57.204 --> 18:59.172
Okay.

18:59.206 --> 19:00.607
I am up.

19:00.640 --> 19:01.774
And you guys

19:01.808 --> 19:04.277
are in big trouble.

19:17.290 --> 19:19.926
(indistinct chatter)

19:28.635 --> 19:29.736
How you doing?

19:33.005 --> 19:34.374
Listen, I'll call you back.

19:34.407 --> 19:35.842
What up?
Hey.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.877
Congrats, man.

19:37.910 --> 19:39.212
(laughs)

19:39.246 --> 19:40.647
I was rooting for you.

19:40.680 --> 19:41.814
Happy to be here.

19:41.848 --> 19:44.517
Wow, what a day, huh?

19:45.852 --> 19:48.688
Death. Such a buzzkill.

19:48.721 --> 19:52.259
You know, I read somewhere
it helps to keep busy.

19:52.292 --> 19:53.493
That's my plan.

19:53.526 --> 19:54.994
I'm gonna move mountains today.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.697
Mm. You trade equities, right?

19:57.730 --> 20:00.700
Yeah. Jen... Jen,

20:00.733 --> 20:04.271
does private wealth management
and, uh, and Victor

20:04.304 --> 20:06.239
is on M&A.

20:06.273 --> 20:07.307
And we're a team.

20:07.340 --> 20:09.642
And we got each other's back.

20:09.676 --> 20:11.411
Until bonus time rolls around.

20:11.444 --> 20:15.014
(both laugh)

20:15.047 --> 20:16.683
You guys do
foreign transactions?

20:16.716 --> 20:18.017
Tons.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.919
It's how we keep pace
with the bigger banks.

20:19.952 --> 20:22.289
Hey, you want to grab a bite?

20:22.322 --> 20:23.590
Uh...

20:23.623 --> 20:24.824
It's Macrobiotic Monday.

20:24.857 --> 20:25.925
Come on.
We're all going.

20:25.958 --> 20:30.963
Tomorrow. I want to check
out things around here.

20:30.997 --> 20:31.931
All right.

20:34.934 --> 20:37.036
After lunch.
Absolutely.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.638
All right.
Bye.

20:45.545 --> 20:47.547
Eric?

20:47.580 --> 20:49.549
I need you to get me
in Keith's computer.

20:49.582 --> 20:50.950
ERIC:
No problem.

20:50.983 --> 20:52.819
Give me a second.

20:53.986 --> 20:55.955
And maybe one more second.

20:55.988 --> 20:57.824
I don't have a second, Eric.

20:57.857 --> 20:59.959
(computer beeping)

20:59.992 --> 21:01.994
Gonna need one more-- oh, nope.

21:02.028 --> 21:03.630
I didn't need
that third second.

21:03.663 --> 21:04.897
You're good to go.

21:04.931 --> 21:08.401
Now, let's see just what kind
of mountains you've been moving.

21:08.435 --> 21:09.936
(typing)

21:09.969 --> 21:12.405
That's it,
I'm doing it.

21:12.439 --> 21:13.973
I'm gonna start
wearing jewelry.

21:14.006 --> 21:15.442
Start wearing
man jewelry.

21:15.475 --> 21:16.543
Please don't.

21:16.576 --> 21:18.678
Oh, gosh, please,
seriously, don't.

21:18.711 --> 21:19.746
What are you
talking about?

21:19.779 --> 21:21.981
You know, just start off
with a nice simple chain.

21:22.014 --> 21:25.017
Maybe put a diamond-encrusted
"D" on it.

21:25.051 --> 21:25.952
Mm.
Work my way up

21:25.985 --> 21:28.588
to a sexy little pinkie ring.

21:28.621 --> 21:31.491
ARKADY: Do not put your grubby
paws on anything, you hear me?

21:31.524 --> 21:34.060
Then why did you invite us up
to your super ornate bedroom

21:34.093 --> 21:36.062
while you shower?
I got to be honest,

21:36.095 --> 21:38.731
it's creepy, Arkady,
even for you.

21:38.765 --> 21:39.866
I tell you already.

21:39.899 --> 21:41.834
I do my best thinking
in the shower.

21:41.868 --> 21:43.503
Oh, me, too.
ARKADY:
Aha!

21:43.536 --> 21:45.738
Does that mean
you have something?

21:45.772 --> 21:48.107
Depends.
(grunts)

21:48.140 --> 21:49.442
(gulps)

21:49.476 --> 21:50.743
(sighs)

21:50.777 --> 21:52.779
I know Sokolov's big sister.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.847
Vladlena.

21:54.881 --> 21:56.716
Beautiful woman.
(sniffs)

21:56.749 --> 21:58.084
That's fantastic.

21:58.117 --> 21:59.118
You think she'll talk to us?

21:59.151 --> 22:00.820
Maybe.

22:00.853 --> 22:01.988
(sniffs)

22:02.021 --> 22:04.090
How good are you two
at poker face?

22:05.157 --> 22:08.327
I can see your nipples.

22:09.729 --> 22:11.664
How's Sam doing?

22:11.698 --> 22:14.100
Oh, uh, great. He's already
into the bank's system.

22:14.133 --> 22:16.469
He's looking for anything
related to Russia in general,

22:16.503 --> 22:17.670
Sokolov in particular.

22:17.704 --> 22:18.838
How'd it go with the apartment?

22:18.871 --> 22:20.640
No, place was almost empty.
I mean,

22:20.673 --> 22:22.642
it is barely lived in.

22:22.675 --> 22:26.078
I don't think it's a trap,
but it may be a misdirect.

22:26.112 --> 22:27.447
I found this.

22:27.480 --> 22:28.615
A receipt

22:28.648 --> 22:30.450
from a bar
on Santa Monica Boulevard.

22:30.483 --> 22:31.718
He was there last night.

22:31.751 --> 22:33.653
Someone's going through
an awful lot of trouble

22:33.686 --> 22:34.821
to get your attention.

22:34.854 --> 22:36.088
Let me know
if you find anything.

22:36.122 --> 22:37.557
Will do.

22:40.059 --> 22:42.161
KEITH:
Trevor.

22:42.194 --> 22:43.830
What up, what up?
'Sup?

22:43.863 --> 22:45.064
Hi, Trevor.

22:45.097 --> 22:45.965
Hey.

22:45.998 --> 22:48.901
I thought you were
all about teamwork.

22:48.935 --> 22:51.704
Oh, I am. I absolutely am.

22:51.738 --> 22:54.140
Because around here,
that includes lunch.

22:54.173 --> 22:56.175
And tomorrow's
Taco Tuesday.

22:56.208 --> 22:57.977
I love tacos.

22:58.010 --> 23:00.613
Oh, and by the way,
is your passport up to date?

23:00.647 --> 23:02.181
You were right.
I'm gonna set

23:02.214 --> 23:05.151
a meeting in Nicaragua,
and I will need someone like you

23:05.184 --> 23:06.052
at my back.

23:06.085 --> 23:07.487
Nicaragua?

23:07.520 --> 23:09.656
Just make sure
your passport's good to go.

23:09.689 --> 23:11.924
Okay.

23:11.958 --> 23:13.059
ARKADY:
Promise you have left

23:13.092 --> 23:17.129
all your guns, knives
and hand grenades in the car?

23:17.163 --> 23:18.665
Where are you taking us again?

23:18.698 --> 23:20.700
(cackles)

23:23.470 --> 23:27.106
What could possibly go wrong?

23:27.139 --> 23:28.475
ARKADY:
Hey, Tomo.

23:28.508 --> 23:30.777
(grunts)

23:30.810 --> 23:32.779
Don't be like that. It's me.

23:32.812 --> 23:34.113
Arkady?

23:34.146 --> 23:35.948
Is that you?
(laughs)

23:35.982 --> 23:36.949
Oh!
Oh, man.

23:36.983 --> 23:38.651
(grunts)
My friend.

23:38.685 --> 23:40.019
Oh, I don't
even recognize you.

23:40.052 --> 23:41.087
You look fantastic.

23:41.120 --> 23:42.855
How are twins?

23:42.889 --> 23:44.223
Oh, just started preschool.

23:44.256 --> 23:45.091
It's crazy.

23:45.124 --> 23:46.459
Crazy.

23:46.493 --> 23:48.461
Tomo, these are my friends.

23:48.495 --> 23:50.096
Friends, Tomo.
Hi, Tomo.

23:50.129 --> 23:52.198
Congrats on the twins.

23:52.231 --> 23:53.933
Can we go inside?

23:53.966 --> 23:56.135
They know the house rules?

23:56.168 --> 23:58.204
What fun is that?

23:58.237 --> 24:00.607
(both laugh)

24:00.640 --> 24:03.476
Come on.

24:05.578 --> 24:08.581
* Hard lights...

24:08.615 --> 24:09.749
Vladlena.

24:09.782 --> 24:12.952
You look as beautiful as ever.

24:12.985 --> 24:15.622
I love what you have
done to your hair.

24:15.655 --> 24:17.056
Mwah.

24:17.089 --> 24:19.191
These are my friends.

24:19.225 --> 24:21.060
They would like to ask
you some questions.

24:21.093 --> 24:23.029
Probably uncomfortable ones,

24:23.062 --> 24:24.531
about your
little brother, Abram.

24:24.564 --> 24:26.265
* Don't get me...

24:26.298 --> 24:27.634
You know the buy-in.

24:27.667 --> 24:28.735
Ah.

24:28.768 --> 24:31.871
Of course.

24:31.904 --> 24:34.874
* Gimme you, gimme, gimme you

24:34.907 --> 24:37.243
* I taste it...

24:37.276 --> 24:39.111
Oh, yeah. Thank you.
Actually we're...

24:39.145 --> 24:41.047
(speaks Russian)

24:41.080 --> 24:43.149
* Gimme you, gimme, gimme you

24:47.687 --> 24:48.655
* Oh, don't...

24:48.688 --> 24:50.256
All right.
All right.

24:50.289 --> 24:52.559
Fair enough.

24:52.592 --> 24:55.528
* Gimme, gimme you...

24:55.562 --> 24:57.129
Wow, that is... not good.

25:14.647 --> 25:17.149
I don't like being
snuck up on, Agent Callen.

25:20.186 --> 25:22.288
Mosley know you're here?

25:22.321 --> 25:23.890
Not exactly.

25:23.923 --> 25:25.892
How's Sam?

25:25.925 --> 25:27.760
He's a pro. And he's got me.

25:27.794 --> 25:31.163
But Leigha Winters just told him
about a meeting in Nicaragua.

25:31.197 --> 25:32.599
What's in Nicaragua?

25:32.632 --> 25:33.833
I don't know.

25:33.866 --> 25:35.602
You should get on that.

25:37.837 --> 25:39.205
Mosley teach you that?

25:39.238 --> 25:41.240
Teach me what?

25:47.947 --> 25:49.081
Fold.

25:49.115 --> 25:51.117
Check.

25:52.785 --> 25:54.787
2,500.

25:57.824 --> 26:01.060
Call.

26:01.093 --> 26:02.795
Ladies first.

26:02.829 --> 26:04.330
Two pair.

26:04.363 --> 26:06.032
Straight flush.

26:06.065 --> 26:08.735
DEEKS (laughing):
Oh!

26:08.768 --> 26:10.837
I have a gambling problem.

26:10.870 --> 26:13.205
There are worse things. Go.

26:13.239 --> 26:14.607
(sighs)

26:14.641 --> 26:16.609
How does that look
on me, Arkady?

26:16.643 --> 26:18.244
Look good?

26:18.277 --> 26:21.714
So, you want to know
about my little brother.

26:21.748 --> 26:23.182
(clears throat)
That's right.

26:23.215 --> 26:24.316
(laughs softly)

26:24.350 --> 26:27.720
I tried to give the little snot
away when he was a baby.

26:27.754 --> 26:29.021
Still kicking myself,

26:29.055 --> 26:30.857
didn't make it happen.

26:30.890 --> 26:33.392
So you guys aren't close, then.

26:33.425 --> 26:35.795
You know, last time
someone asked questions

26:35.828 --> 26:37.329
about my brother,

26:37.363 --> 26:40.700
Abram find out,
and then he find him,

26:40.733 --> 26:45.404
and then he gave a man
a very nice bath in acid.

26:45.437 --> 26:46.973
Mm.
Well, thank you

26:47.006 --> 26:48.875
for that truly terrifying
heads-up.

26:48.908 --> 26:50.076
But, you know, while we're here.

26:50.109 --> 26:53.412
So does your brother have
any connections with Nicaragua?

26:53.445 --> 26:56.916
My brother's
obsessed with ponies.

26:56.949 --> 26:58.350
Like a little boy.
Hmm.

26:58.384 --> 27:00.687
He buys a filly,

27:00.720 --> 27:04.190
and then he needs a place
to keep a filly...
Right.

27:04.223 --> 27:06.025
...so he buys a resort
in Nicaragua.

27:06.058 --> 27:07.326
Why Nicaragua?

27:07.359 --> 27:09.662
To practice his Spanish.

27:09.696 --> 27:11.664
I kid.

27:11.698 --> 27:13.199
He buy in Nicaragua
for two reasons.

27:13.232 --> 27:14.967
One, his filly.

27:15.001 --> 27:19.271
Two, because he can get away
with whatever he wants there.

27:20.372 --> 27:23.309
Bury bodies in the sand,
if he feels like.

27:23.342 --> 27:26.378
We think our friend is meeting
your brother in Nicaragua.

27:26.412 --> 27:28.280
Is it about a pony?

27:28.314 --> 27:29.882
No.
Mm-mm.

27:29.916 --> 27:30.983
(tongue clicks)

27:31.017 --> 27:33.652
Then it's unfortunate
for your friend.

27:36.255 --> 27:37.389
Huh.

27:37.423 --> 27:38.390
You're creative, Sokolov.

27:38.424 --> 27:39.859
I'll give you that.

27:39.892 --> 27:41.293
G, Hidoko.

27:41.327 --> 27:44.030
I know what Nelson
was doing for Sokolov.

27:44.063 --> 27:45.397
Mirror trading.

27:45.431 --> 27:47.033
The bank's been buying shares
of Russian stocks

27:47.066 --> 27:48.467
with Sokolov's rubles,

27:48.500 --> 27:50.336
then seconds later,
selling the same shares

27:50.369 --> 27:52.739
at the same price for dollars.

27:52.772 --> 27:54.340
He's laundering his money
through the bank's equity desk.

27:54.373 --> 27:56.976
They made another mirror trade
for him this morning.

27:57.009 --> 27:58.811
That must be
what Mountebank means.

27:58.845 --> 28:00.012
Now we just need to figure out

28:00.046 --> 28:02.048
what Sokolov's
using the money for.

28:02.081 --> 28:04.717
(phone rings)

28:04.751 --> 28:05.785
What do you got, Nell?

28:05.818 --> 28:06.919
NELL:
So, you were right.

28:06.953 --> 28:09.055
The new Dexter Hughes
credit card was just authorized

28:09.088 --> 28:11.423
at the same bar
on Santa Monica Boulevard.

28:11.457 --> 28:13.325
The guy's probably there now.

28:13.359 --> 28:15.427
Grab your gun. Meet me there.

28:17.930 --> 28:19.065
ARKADY: Crush him,
Tomo, crush him.

28:19.098 --> 28:20.132
Come on, come on.

28:20.166 --> 28:21.467
ARKADY:
Crush him, Tomo.

28:21.500 --> 28:22.835
Come on, Tomo!

28:22.869 --> 28:24.403
Crush him.

28:24.436 --> 28:25.337
Come on!

28:25.371 --> 28:27.406
(shouting)

28:27.439 --> 28:28.941
DEEKS (sighs): I am the
champion of the world.

28:28.975 --> 28:30.309
Really?

28:30.342 --> 28:31.377
You know the deal.

28:31.410 --> 28:32.945
You keep your word,
you get your necklace back.

28:32.979 --> 28:34.080
(groans)

28:34.113 --> 28:36.448
What else do you want to know?

28:36.482 --> 28:39.485
How did your brother start
working with Phillip Nelson?

28:39.518 --> 28:41.954
My brother had dirt on Phillip.

28:41.988 --> 28:43.990
Thick, juicy dirt.

28:44.023 --> 28:46.525
But then Phillip
start say no to Abram,

28:46.558 --> 28:48.160
so, do svidaniya, Phillip.

28:48.194 --> 28:49.361
(grunting)

28:51.063 --> 28:53.165
But the bank is still
doing work for him.

28:53.199 --> 28:54.466
Well, of course.

28:54.500 --> 28:56.502
He got thick, juicy dirt
on the lady.

28:56.535 --> 28:58.537
Who, Leigha Winters?

28:58.570 --> 29:00.372
Mm-hmm.

29:00.406 --> 29:02.208
All right.

29:02.241 --> 29:04.110
Well done.

29:04.143 --> 29:06.946
Trust me, my brother
is not rocket scientist.

29:06.979 --> 29:08.114
Okay, Deeks,

29:08.147 --> 29:09.448
let's go. We got to talk
to Leigha Winters.

29:09.481 --> 29:11.283
Hold on, one second--
Arkady, over the top!

29:11.317 --> 29:12.551
Come on, Arkady!

29:12.584 --> 29:14.420
Get your shirt back!
(shouts)

29:14.453 --> 29:16.222
(grunts)
DEEKS:
Really?

29:16.255 --> 29:17.456
That's all you got?

29:17.489 --> 29:18.524
No, I got more.

29:18.557 --> 29:20.192
Before you go.

29:20.226 --> 29:21.961
What is this supposed to be?

29:21.994 --> 29:22.995
My invoice.

29:23.029 --> 29:25.197
(scoffs)
(laughs)

29:25.231 --> 29:26.532
Great.

29:28.968 --> 29:30.502
* I changed my clothes

29:30.536 --> 29:32.805
* My hair, my name

29:32.839 --> 29:34.506
* Makes no difference
who's to blame *

29:34.540 --> 29:36.175
* Give up

29:36.208 --> 29:39.445
* Wait, but don't give up

29:39.478 --> 29:41.814
* I still got one thing to do

29:41.848 --> 29:44.416
* Baby, I'd start running
if I were you *

29:44.450 --> 29:45.818
* Oh...

29:49.621 --> 29:51.991
How you doing?

29:52.024 --> 29:53.525
I'm supposed
to meet someone here.

29:53.559 --> 29:56.128
A, uh, Dexter Hughes?

30:03.035 --> 30:04.470
Nell!
On it!

30:07.506 --> 30:09.141
(grunts)

30:11.343 --> 30:14.113
Impressive.
Thanks.

30:18.384 --> 30:19.852
(phone buzzes)

30:19.886 --> 30:21.320
(grunts)

30:21.353 --> 30:23.089
Not so fast, Dexter.

30:23.122 --> 30:25.024
Hey, Kensi and Deeks

30:25.057 --> 30:26.859
are bringing Leigha Winters
to the boatshed.

30:29.461 --> 30:31.998
Looks like you're coming
with me.

30:44.176 --> 30:46.012
Is it Bring a Kid to Work Day?

30:46.045 --> 30:47.579
(door closes)

30:50.382 --> 30:52.618
So, who's your new little buddy?

30:52.651 --> 30:56.322
That, apparently, is the person
who's been stealing

30:56.355 --> 30:58.190
the identity of Dexter Hughes.

30:58.224 --> 31:00.659
No.
A kid hacked your alias?

31:00.692 --> 31:02.261
Wow. Respect.

31:02.294 --> 31:03.896
I guess.
I just have to figure out

31:03.930 --> 31:05.564
if he's involved in this case.

31:05.597 --> 31:07.666
Does Leigha Winters know why
you two brought her down here?

31:07.699 --> 31:10.469
I mean, she works
with numbers.

31:10.502 --> 31:12.471
She can put two and two
together.

31:12.504 --> 31:13.539
What?

31:13.572 --> 31:15.074
If you catch my drift.

31:15.107 --> 31:17.276
What did you do to Arkady?

31:17.309 --> 31:18.577
Let's just not encourage him.

31:18.610 --> 31:20.879
Bling.

31:28.587 --> 31:30.589
Leigha Winters...

31:30.622 --> 31:32.091
come on down.

31:32.124 --> 31:33.125
I really can't be here
right now.

31:33.159 --> 31:35.261
And yet here you are.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.334
Why don't you tell me
exactly what you're doing

31:42.368 --> 31:43.469
for Abram Sokolov?

31:43.502 --> 31:45.604
Pretty sure you know what,

31:45.637 --> 31:47.506
or I wouldn't be here.

31:47.539 --> 31:49.208
So, you're doing
these mirror trades

31:49.241 --> 31:50.609
to launder his rubles
into dollars

31:50.642 --> 31:51.577
because he's blackmailing you?

31:51.610 --> 31:53.112
That's right.

31:53.145 --> 31:54.646
Do you want to tell me
what he has on you?

31:54.680 --> 31:56.949
(chuckles wryly)
Not particularly.

31:56.983 --> 31:59.185
That's okay.

31:59.218 --> 32:02.588
I'll use my imagination.

32:02.621 --> 32:04.690
Who's this?

32:04.723 --> 32:06.292
No idea.

32:06.325 --> 32:07.626
I've never seen him before.

32:07.659 --> 32:10.229
Sokolov ever mention
anyone young?

32:10.262 --> 32:11.663
Maybe somebody working for him?

32:11.697 --> 32:14.733
Hmm, just a lot
of horse-breeding studs.

32:14.766 --> 32:18.570
Does the rest of your office
know that Sokolov is the client?

32:18.604 --> 32:20.672
I didn't even know
until last week.

32:20.706 --> 32:22.641
They all think the mirror trades
are for an oil company.

32:22.674 --> 32:25.611
And what is he planning to do
with all this money?

32:25.644 --> 32:27.313
That's why I can't be here
right now.

32:27.346 --> 32:28.380
He's expecting me.

32:28.414 --> 32:30.016
Sokolov...

32:30.049 --> 32:31.183
is here,

32:31.217 --> 32:32.418
in L.A.?

32:32.451 --> 32:34.286
I'm supposed to meet him
in an hour.

32:34.320 --> 32:36.622
What's the money for?

32:36.655 --> 32:39.425
Phillip found out Sokolov
is using the dollars

32:39.458 --> 32:41.560
to arm Ukrainians.

32:41.593 --> 32:44.563
He wants to escalate
the conflict with Russia.

32:44.596 --> 32:48.067
Sokolov knows it's a war
Ukraine can never win.

32:48.100 --> 32:50.136
And if they're using

32:50.169 --> 32:52.338
our weapons...

32:52.371 --> 32:55.207
that means he's trying
to drag America into it.

33:05.551 --> 33:07.753
So, Sokolov is using
laundered, American dollars

33:07.786 --> 33:08.820
to arm the Ukrainians

33:08.854 --> 33:11.090
in the hopes of escalating
the conflict with Russia.

33:11.123 --> 33:12.191
And he's here in L.A.?

33:12.224 --> 33:14.626
Apparently. He's supposed
to meet with Leigha Winters.

33:14.660 --> 33:16.228
Oh, maybe we can use that.

33:16.262 --> 33:17.463
That's what I was thinking.

33:17.496 --> 33:20.399
There's only one way to get
the cash out of Sokolov's hands,

33:20.432 --> 33:22.334
but still maintain
our access to him

33:22.368 --> 33:23.535
and his corrupt,
Russian buddies.

33:23.569 --> 33:24.670
Well, it is a risk.

33:24.703 --> 33:26.338
It's also our only shot.

33:26.372 --> 33:28.774
Start prepping Leigha.

33:28.807 --> 33:31.043
Sokolov is worth
more to us alive,

33:31.077 --> 33:32.744
thinking he's a free man,
than dead.

33:32.778 --> 33:34.146
Take Hidoko with you.

33:34.180 --> 33:35.514
You're still
one man short.

33:35.547 --> 33:37.383
Yeah, I agree.
Sam should maintain his cover.

33:37.416 --> 33:40.386
This goes south, we need to
still have somebody in the bank.

33:40.419 --> 33:42.521
According to Leigha,
it's Sokolov's only access

33:42.554 --> 33:43.389
to American money.

33:43.422 --> 33:45.557
Well, it's a big gamble,
Agent Callen.

33:45.591 --> 33:47.626
Let's hope it pays off.

34:07.379 --> 34:09.781
KENSI:
Think she's up for this?

34:09.815 --> 34:11.450
Find out soon enough.

34:11.483 --> 34:13.785
Hey, guys, we have, uh,
nothing to worry about

34:13.819 --> 34:15.354
'cause I got my
lucky chain on.

34:15.387 --> 34:16.288
Oh, my gosh.

34:16.322 --> 34:18.657
I really wish you hadn't
jinxed us like that.

34:18.690 --> 34:20.359
Rock and roll.

34:20.392 --> 34:22.361
MAN:
Move 'em to the side.

34:26.598 --> 34:28.634
Leigha, come.

34:28.667 --> 34:30.169
Come.

34:30.202 --> 34:31.503
Is that...?

34:31.537 --> 34:33.572
50 SPF sunblock.

34:33.605 --> 34:35.674
Paraben-free.

34:35.707 --> 34:36.842
I kid.

34:36.875 --> 34:39.845
This is the money
you wash for me.

34:39.878 --> 34:42.681
I smuggle it in boxes.

34:42.714 --> 34:44.816
You want to see?

34:46.218 --> 34:47.686
I kid.

34:47.719 --> 34:50.489
We don't have time
for that now.

34:50.522 --> 34:53.725
We have more important things
to worry about.

34:53.759 --> 34:56.495
CALLEN (whispering):
Hold tight, guys.

34:56.528 --> 34:57.563
LEIGHA:
Mr. Sokolov,

34:57.596 --> 34:58.597
sorry to be blunt,

34:58.630 --> 35:00.466
but why exactly am I here?

35:00.499 --> 35:02.834
Yes. We need more blunt.

35:02.868 --> 35:04.069
This is why I like you.

35:04.102 --> 35:06.805
We are in business together,
but I know nothing about you.

35:08.607 --> 35:12.578
Except, of course, what you did
that hot, hot night in Dallas.

35:12.611 --> 35:15.714
But just because
I like you,

35:15.747 --> 35:18.750
doesn't mean I trust you.

35:18.784 --> 35:20.752
Come on, Leigha.

35:20.786 --> 35:24.456
You can trust me, Mr. Sokolov.

35:24.490 --> 35:25.724
Go, Deeks.

35:28.260 --> 35:29.761
(Leigha gasps)

35:29.795 --> 35:32.631
(speaks Russian)

35:33.799 --> 35:35.267
(Deeks whoops)

35:39.605 --> 35:40.839
(Leigha screams)

35:41.907 --> 35:44.176
Go wait back here!

35:53.619 --> 35:55.221
Come on, come on!

36:03.695 --> 36:04.830
I know a way out. Let's go.

36:04.863 --> 36:06.232
KENSI:
They're gone.

36:14.873 --> 36:16.575
(man grunts)

36:17.576 --> 36:19.678
(grunts)

36:25.651 --> 36:27.686
You two! Come here.

36:27.719 --> 36:29.588
On your knees, right here.

36:29.621 --> 36:30.789
Stay down.

36:30.822 --> 36:32.724
Money is secure.

36:32.758 --> 36:34.860
My car is this way.

36:34.893 --> 36:37.763
Move. Move, move.

36:37.796 --> 36:38.897
Watch it.

36:41.032 --> 36:42.468
Done.

36:42.501 --> 36:43.535
CALLEN:
Eric, did we get it?

36:43.569 --> 36:44.903
Nothing yet.

36:45.871 --> 36:47.439
I'm in position.

36:47.473 --> 36:48.740
CALLEN:
Hold tight.

36:48.774 --> 36:49.875
Okay. Get in!

36:49.908 --> 36:51.377
Get in.

36:53.912 --> 36:55.614
Callen, we're gonna lose him.

36:55.647 --> 36:57.883
Callen.
Hold tight.

36:57.916 --> 36:59.618
How about now?

36:59.651 --> 37:01.653
ERIC:
Still nothing.

37:01.687 --> 37:05.291
Callen.

37:05.324 --> 37:07.225
Callen.

37:09.728 --> 37:11.297
Success.

37:11.330 --> 37:13.699
Hidoko put Overwatch spray
on Sokolov.

37:15.367 --> 37:17.703
Good work.

37:26.878 --> 37:28.514
Nice work, guys.

37:28.547 --> 37:29.848
Your gamble paid off.

37:29.881 --> 37:32.584
We just recovered all the money
Sokolov was laundering

37:32.618 --> 37:33.919
through the bank.

37:33.952 --> 37:36.888
He won't be arming
any Ukrainians anytime soon.

37:36.922 --> 37:38.490
Mm. How's Leigha
holding up?

37:38.524 --> 37:39.458
Surprisingly well,

37:39.491 --> 37:41.560
now that Sokolov is
on a flight to Moscow.

37:41.593 --> 37:43.795
Well, he came to see if he could
trust her and he got his answer.

37:43.829 --> 37:45.797
KENSI: And with the tracker
Hidoko put on him, we'll be able

37:45.831 --> 37:47.333
to keep tabs on the bastard
wherever he goes

37:47.366 --> 37:49.000
for the next few weeks. Or more.

37:49.034 --> 37:50.902
Depending
on his personal hygiene.

37:50.936 --> 37:52.804
CALLEN: (chuckles)
Well, if and when Sokolov

37:52.838 --> 37:54.840
decides to make his next move,

37:54.873 --> 37:56.642
we will be ready.

37:56.675 --> 37:58.310
DEEKS:
Nice.

37:58.344 --> 38:00.045
Just, uh, one
more... thing.
Oh, yeah.

38:00.078 --> 38:02.781
One more tiny
little thing.

38:02.814 --> 38:04.950
(clears throat)

38:04.983 --> 38:06.852
What is that?

38:06.885 --> 38:09.921
That is a receipt
from Arkady.

38:10.822 --> 38:12.791
You've got to be kidding me,
Deeks.

38:12.824 --> 38:14.926
I wish that I was.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.763
I don't know
why that's sticky. Sorry.

38:17.796 --> 38:18.897
Good night.
Good night.

38:18.930 --> 38:20.899
Oh, uh...

38:20.932 --> 38:23.835
Hidoko took names today.

38:28.106 --> 38:31.610
Who do you think trained her?

38:31.643 --> 38:33.712
(phone chimes)
Oh.

38:33.745 --> 38:36.582
Hatch, I'm gonna put
you on the big screen

38:36.615 --> 38:38.417
so Callen can hear us.

38:41.953 --> 38:43.855
What you got for us?
I checked out

38:43.889 --> 38:46.492
Hetty's boat. It's still moored
in Hanalei Bay.

38:46.525 --> 38:47.959
Came in sometime the night

38:47.993 --> 38:49.961
of September 6
and hasn't moved since.

38:49.995 --> 38:51.730
Been abandoned for weeks.

38:51.763 --> 38:53.532
She's probably
on the island.

38:53.565 --> 38:55.701
She never stepped foot on shore.

38:55.734 --> 38:56.902
Her tradecraft is top-notch.

38:56.935 --> 38:59.104
If she didn't want you
to see her...

38:59.137 --> 39:00.806
Well, this is Kauai, not Kansas.

39:00.839 --> 39:02.708
Nobody,
especially a haole stranger,

39:02.741 --> 39:04.610
goes anywhere
without my people knowing.

39:04.643 --> 39:05.877
So where is she?

39:05.911 --> 39:07.679
Maybe with Tilo Iona.

39:07.713 --> 39:08.880
Who's that?

39:08.914 --> 39:10.616
Guy suspected of running one

39:10.649 --> 39:13.118
of the biggest drug smuggling
operations in the Pacific.

39:13.151 --> 39:15.587
What makes you think
she's with Iona?

39:15.621 --> 39:18.857
Heard a rumor that he had
a Menehune on one of his boats.

39:18.890 --> 39:20.926
Could just be stoner talk.

39:20.959 --> 39:22.093
A Menehune?

39:22.127 --> 39:24.696
Little forest people.

39:24.730 --> 39:26.965
Like, uh, Hawaiian leprechauns.

39:26.998 --> 39:30.001
But like I said,
it's only a rumor.

39:30.035 --> 39:31.537
All right. Thanks, Hatch.
Appreciate it.

39:31.570 --> 39:32.871
Let us know
if you need anything else.

39:32.904 --> 39:34.573
Will do. Aloha.

39:34.606 --> 39:36.975
Aloha.
(chuckles)

39:37.008 --> 39:38.844
What do you think?

39:38.877 --> 39:43.449
I think we need to start digging
deeper into this Tilo Iona.

39:43.482 --> 39:44.783
(chair scrapes in distance)

39:44.816 --> 39:46.652
Who was that?

39:47.686 --> 39:49.955
I'm about to find out.

40:05.637 --> 40:07.606
You 18?

40:07.639 --> 40:09.775
Yeah.

40:09.808 --> 40:12.043
Good. 'Cause if you weren't,

40:12.077 --> 40:13.445
there's a whole nother set
of government agents

40:13.479 --> 40:15.547
I have to bring in here
to talk to you.

40:15.581 --> 40:17.015
I don't want that,
and I'm pretty sure

40:17.048 --> 40:18.684
you don't
want that either.

40:18.717 --> 40:20.118
Whatever.

40:20.151 --> 40:23.455
Do you know
who Abram Sokolov is?

40:23.489 --> 40:25.190
No.

40:25.223 --> 40:27.158
Do you know
who Leigha Winters is?

40:27.192 --> 40:28.894
No.

40:28.927 --> 40:30.996
Do you know
who Grisha Callen is?

40:31.029 --> 40:32.197
No.

40:33.231 --> 40:35.467
Do you have an apartment
in Santa Monica?

40:37.135 --> 40:39.137
Yeah.

40:40.171 --> 40:42.641
You signed the lease yesterday.

40:42.674 --> 40:44.676
Where'd you live
before that?

40:48.680 --> 40:50.682
Shelter?

40:55.086 --> 40:57.889
Maybe.

40:59.024 --> 41:01.993
The one on Hauser
or the one on Colorado?

41:02.027 --> 41:04.596
Colorado.

41:04.630 --> 41:06.064
(chuckles softly)

41:06.097 --> 41:08.066
They still have, uh,

41:08.099 --> 41:09.968
that pink floral tile
in the bathroom?

41:10.001 --> 41:11.970
Yeah, they do.

41:12.003 --> 41:13.739
But somebody punched a hole
in the wall,

41:13.772 --> 41:14.740
so it's patched up white now.

41:14.773 --> 41:17.275
Right next to the mirror, huh?

41:17.308 --> 41:18.977
Yeah.

41:19.010 --> 41:21.012
(chuckles)

41:22.047 --> 41:23.949
That was you.

41:28.186 --> 41:30.822
This is what
we're gonna do.

41:30.856 --> 41:33.024
You can keep the lease.

41:33.058 --> 41:36.127
You can stay
in the apartment.

41:36.161 --> 41:38.263
But if you ever use
Dexter Hughes' name

41:38.296 --> 41:40.065
or credit cards again,

41:40.098 --> 41:42.100
I'm coming after you.

41:42.133 --> 41:44.135
Understood?

41:45.136 --> 41:46.972
You're letting me go?

41:47.005 --> 41:48.974
I'm thinking about it.

41:51.042 --> 41:54.012
You might have
great potential.

41:54.045 --> 41:55.681
Don't worry,

41:55.714 --> 41:57.849
I don't want
anything from you.

41:57.883 --> 42:00.686
But if you ever need
to talk or...

42:00.719 --> 42:02.788
you find yourself in trouble...

42:04.956 --> 42:06.725
...give me a call.

42:09.294 --> 42:11.229
My name's Callen.

42:12.263 --> 42:14.265
I'm Matt.

42:18.303 --> 42:21.239
Finn, all right? My name's Finn.

42:23.074 --> 42:25.076
Okay, Finn.
