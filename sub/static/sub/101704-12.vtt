00:08.356 --> 00:10.271
I did shoot myself
with a nail gun.

00:10.314 --> 00:12.099

you're a danger to yourself.

without the company knowing?

00:21.369 --> 00:22.761
That's what caused her seizure.

to unblind her.

it's necessary.

come to work with you?

01:26.651 --> 01:27.913

go out and do anything.

I'm like a prisoner.

more freedom but, you know,

01:49.326 --> 01:51.546
that would require
a certain amount of trust.

So far, we haven't

17:33.617 --> 17:36.098

17:36.142 --> 17:37.534
- Mr. and Mrs. Forbes,

17:37.578 --> 17:40.102
I spent a long time
in the COVID ward.

17:40.146 --> 17:43.236
I saw patients
on ventilators for weeks.

17:43.279 --> 17:45.455
A lot of them

17:45.499 --> 17:46.674

17:47.805 --> 17:50.895

17:50.939 --> 17:52.680
- Considering the stress
you've been under

17:52.723 --> 17:53.811
for the past few months,

17:53.855 --> 17:55.248
it would be understandable

17:55.291 --> 17:56.771
if this was anxiety based.

17:56.814 --> 17:58.164
- She's not imagining this!

17:58.207 --> 17:59.774
- No, no one's saying she is.

17:59.817 --> 18:01.863
Look, anxiety,
if that's what's behind this,

18:01.906 --> 18:03.647

18:03.691 --> 18:05.519
- You can't do anything

18:05.562 --> 18:08.696

her symptoms, run tests, but--

18:08.739 --> 18:09.784
- But what?

18:09.827 --> 18:10.959
- If all else fails,

18:11.002 --> 18:12.134
it can't hurt to speak with

18:12.178 --> 18:14.005
one of our in-house
psychiatrists.

18:18.793 --> 18:20.664

18:20.708 --> 18:21.796

We need to scope her.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.092
Letting her in now would

Our drug could save her life.

27:23.206 --> 27:25.121
- It's a device
that's implanted in your chest

27:25.165 --> 27:26.993
that can help regulate
your heart.

27:27.036 --> 27:28.603
If an arrhythmia develops,

27:28.647 --> 27:29.604
it can shock your heart

27:29.648 --> 27:32.215

a normal sinus rhythm.

procedure,

27:47.840 --> 27:50.320

the LVAD work better.

28:24.267 --> 28:26.748

where it occurs.

28:26.792 --> 28:28.010
But in very rare cases,

28:28.054 --> 28:29.795

can migrate

28:29.838 --> 28:31.013

- Yeah, I'll see you, okay?

37:57.797 --> 38:00.800

sweetie?

38:00.843 --> 38:03.846

who ran away earlier,

38:03.890 --> 38:05.805
did you ever find her?

38:05.848 --> 38:08.198
- Not yet.

38:08.242 --> 38:10.244
- Well, is she dangerous?

- Okay, well, it's my fault
that she's gone.

38:25.128 --> 38:27.261
If I hadn't made you come out
of her room in the first place,

38:27.305 --> 38:29.307
then she'd still be here.
She wouldn't have left.

38:29.350 --> 38:31.265
- Anna, it is not your fault.
Trust me.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.093
She wanted to leave.
She was gonna find a way.

38:33.136 --> 38:35.400
- Yeah, but I keep screwing up.

38:35.443 --> 38:36.401
I mean, I bet you wish that

38:36.444 --> 38:38.925
I'd gone to live
with Mom instead.

- I don't wish that,
not even a bit.

38:42.015 --> 38:43.843

that you do for me,

38:43.886 --> 38:45.323
and then look what I do.

38:47.281 --> 38:50.676

Okay, you don't owe me
anything,

38:52.895 --> 38:55.942

that's not gonna matter

I can't just, like,
