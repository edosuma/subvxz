The Springfield Police have told me
that 91 % of all traffic accidents...

01:00.833 --> 01:03.233
Yeah, l know. l know.
But the bad news is...

01:03.336 --> 01:05.327
we gotta start havin' designated drivers.

01:05.438 --> 01:08.532
- Are you kidding me?

01:08.641 --> 01:10.609
We'll choose the same way
they pick the pope.

01:10.710 --> 01:13.645
Everybody reach in
and draw a pickled egg.

01:13.746 --> 01:17.147
Whoever gets the black egg
stays sober tonight.

01:20.386 --> 01:22.479
Whew!

Oh, no.
Oh, no. Not tonight!

02:00.092 --> 02:02.424
Not tonight!

02:06.432 --> 02:09.889
Are you ready to get Duffed?

02:10.002 --> 02:13.733
- Hey, it's Duffman...

02:13.839 --> 02:17.297
the guy in a costume
that creates aWareness of Duff.

02:17.410 --> 02:20.937
Duffman wants to party down

l'm the designated driver!

02:46.172 --> 02:49.539
Yeah, that's swell.

02:49.642 --> 02:52.941
Duff wholeheartedly supports
the designated driver program.

02:53.045 --> 02:56.708
Now, who wants to party?
-

03:08.894 --> 03:11.761
Please!
l'm trying to drive!

03:11.864 --> 03:13.923
Hey, let's go to the girls' college!

03:14.033 --> 03:15.933
No. The Playboy Mansion.
Playboy Mansion!

03:16.035 --> 03:21.302
Shut up! lt's my car, and l say
we're going to the lost city of gold.

03:21.407 --> 03:23.307
That's just drunk talk.

03:23.409 --> 03:26.310
Sweet, beautiful drunk talk.

03:28.447 --> 03:33.441
Good night, Barney. Don't forget
to bring back my car back tomorrow.

03:33.552 --> 03:36.043

03:36.155 --> 03:39.647
Yes. Tomorrow.

03:51.937 --> 03:55.805
Face it, Homer, the car is gone.
- Ohl

03:55.908 --> 03:58.741
Barney ain't never comin' back.

Here We are, Mr. Gumble.

04:02.014 --> 04:04.744
Huh? Thanks for the lift!

04:04.850 --> 04:06.750
Barney, where's my car?

04:06.852 --> 04:09.787
All l remember about the last two months...

04:09.889 --> 04:12.483
is giving a guest lecture at Villanova.

04:12.591 --> 04:14.491
Or maybe it was a street corner.

04:14.593 --> 04:18.324
So you lost my car, eh?
Well, that's just grand.

04:18.430 --> 04:23.994
l oughta punch you in the nose,
but l have to pick up my kids at school.

04:32.445 --> 04:35.937
Homer, l don't want you driving around
in a car you built yourself.

04:36.048 --> 04:40.280
Marge, you can stand there finding fault,
or you can knit me some seat belts.

04:40.386 --> 04:42.786
Sorry, sorry.

04:42.888 --> 04:45.186
Dad, you got a letter
from the City of New York.

04:45.291 --> 04:47.191
Throw it away.

04:47.293 --> 04:50.126
Nothing good has ever
come out of New York City.

04:50.229 --> 04:55.098
'Dear motorist, Your vehicle is illegally
parked in the borough of Manhattan.'

04:55.201 --> 04:58.726
My vehicle!
- 'lf you do not remedy this malparkage

04:58.826 --> 05:00.006
within 72 hours...

05:00.106 --> 05:03.940
your car will be thrown
into the East River at your expense.'

05:04.043 --> 05:07.274
Oh! l don't wanna go to New York City!

05:07.379 --> 05:10.041
Why not?
- New York is a hellhole!

05:10.149 --> 05:12.276
And you know how l feel about hellholes.

05:12.384 --> 05:14.648
Dad, you can't judge a place
you've never been to.

05:14.754 --> 05:16.654
Yeah.
That's what people do in Russia.

05:19.191 --> 05:24.629
lt's time l told you about a chapter
of my life l hoped would be closed forever.

05:24.730 --> 05:29.326
l was on my way to the Harrisburg
Coat Outlet to buy an irregular coat...

05:29.435 --> 05:33.667
but it required a stopover in New York City.

05:37.943 --> 05:42.107
All l had to do Was Walk a feWblocks
from the Rort Authority Bus Terminal...

05:42.214 --> 05:44.182
to my train at Renn Station.

06:08.974 --> 06:12.569
AnyhoW, l must'ye looked
at somebody the Wrong Way...

06:12.678 --> 06:17.081
because the next thing l kneW,
l Was running for my life.

06:34.233 --> 06:36.793
And that's when the CHUDs came at me.

06:36.902 --> 06:39.928
Oh, Homer, of course you'll have
a bad impression of New York...

06:40.039 --> 06:42.530
if you only focus
on the pimps and the CHUDs.

06:42.641 --> 06:44.541
Oh, l'd love to see New York.

06:44.643 --> 06:48.170
We could all go with the bus company's
special super-sitter fare.

06:48.280 --> 06:50.180
Nine bucks?
This one's on me!

06:50.282 --> 06:53.547
Great! We're all going to New York!

06:53.652 --> 06:59.022
Lousy Bart and his money.
All right, New York, l'm comin' back!

06:59.124 --> 07:03.220
But you're not gettin' this!

07:03.329 --> 07:06.492
Dad, our baby pictures were in there.
- Don't you start!

07:10.336 --> 07:12.236
Wake up, eyeryone. We're almost there.

07:19.378 --> 07:22.905
That took too long. How come
we had to transfer in Atlanta twice?

07:23.015 --> 07:27.349
l just think we should've paid the extra
$1 .50 and gotten a bus with restrooms.

07:31.123 --> 07:34.889
Hey. Marge, l can't feel my legs.

07:34.994 --> 07:37.462
l can't feel my legs!
- Homer!

07:37.563 --> 07:41.260
Homer, those legs belong
to the man behind you.

07:41.367 --> 07:43.267
Hi.

07:43.369 --> 07:46.600
We're here!

07:46.705 --> 07:49.697
Wow! l feel like such a nobody.

07:53.178 --> 07:55.442
lt's wall-to-wall landmarks.

07:55.547 --> 07:58.880
The Williamsburg Bridge.
Fourth Avenue.

08:03.088 --> 08:06.319
You guys rock!
- Eh, maybe a little.

08:10.529 --> 08:14.226
Now remember,
criminals prey on small-town folk like us.

08:14.333 --> 08:18.099
So if anyone asks, we're sophisticated
millionaires from the Ozarks.

08:18.203 --> 08:20.501
Homer, you're scaring the children.
- Good.

08:20.606 --> 08:24.098
l don't wanna spend one extra second
in this urban death maze.

08:24.209 --> 08:26.677
You wait here at the bus station
while l get the car.

08:26.779 --> 08:30.408
The bus station is just
one of the sights we came to see.

08:30.516 --> 08:33.313
We'll meet you in Central Park at 5:00.

08:33.419 --> 08:36.013

Hmm. Ooh!

09:12.191 --> 09:13.681
Wow!

09:13.792 --> 09:15.817
