WEBVTT

00:02.640 --> 00:06.564
Torchwood, outside the Government,
beyond the Police.

00:06.600 --> 00:12.000
Tracking down alien life on Earth,
arming the human race against the future.

00:12.035 --> 00:14.839
The 21st century
is when everything changes.

00:14.874 --> 00:16.524
And you've got to be ready.

00:16.559 --> 00:25.560
This programme contains
some strong language.

00:27.079 --> 00:33.539
The speed of light is
299,792,458 metres per second.

00:33.574 --> 00:40.000
Pain travels through the body
at 350 feet per second.

00:40.035 --> 00:43.320
Even a sneeze can reach 100mph.

00:43.355 --> 00:45.604
And as for life,

00:45.639 --> 00:48.919
well, that just bloody whizzes by.

00:52.719 --> 00:56.320
So then, this is me,

00:56.355 --> 00:59.520
Eugene Jones.

01:26.200 --> 01:30.685
Hey, Gwen. Jack! Er, Tosh...

01:30.720 --> 01:35.500
The guys at the rope just let me through
so... I'd say at least 50 miles per hour.

01:35.535 --> 01:40.280
Travelled on the bonnet, bounced, maybe
rolled, smashed his face on the road.

01:40.315 --> 01:44.045
Hey? Um, excuse me,
but that looks a lot like me.

01:44.080 --> 01:47.679
He couldn't even cross the road
without messing it up.

01:47.714 --> 01:50.565
No bag - nothing.
I mean, what was he doing here?

01:50.600 --> 01:56.884
Perhaps he was hit deliberately... Maybe he
really did have something important. Like what?

01:56.919 --> 02:01.519
I don't know. He was always trying to talk to us,
show us stuff. Perhaps we shouldn't have been so...

02:01.554 --> 02:04.285
Gwen, I think it's just
an ordinary RTA. Guys?

02:04.320 --> 02:08.680
It was a red car. There's red paint
under his fingernails. Am I dead?

02:16.719 --> 02:18.720
Am I dead?

02:21.120 --> 02:23.199
Am I dead?

02:33.240 --> 02:35.119
PHONE RINGS

02:39.719 --> 02:43.320
Yes? Hello, love. I've just been
to the shops and forgot tea-bags.

02:45.359 --> 02:46.805
Hello...?

02:46.840 --> 02:50.324
Eugene? Hi, Mrs Jones.

02:50.359 --> 02:53.039
Something's happened.
We need to talk to you.

02:53.074 --> 02:55.877
What happened? How did I end up here?

02:55.912 --> 02:58.680
I mean, I'm dead, but I'm not dead.

02:58.715 --> 03:00.805
So... Shit!

03:00.840 --> 03:05.080
So, what? Am I a ghost or a zombie?

03:05.115 --> 03:06.845
Oh, God. Right, calm.

03:06.880 --> 03:08.479
Yeah? Stick with the team.

03:08.514 --> 03:10.325
What? You're driving.

03:10.360 --> 03:13.920
This is Torchwood,
it's going to be OK.

03:16.359 --> 03:19.000
Oh, what?! Of course, I'm invisible.

03:19.035 --> 03:21.524
Why am I invisible?

03:21.559 --> 03:24.039
Anything on his phone from today?

03:24.074 --> 03:26.520
Just some pictures of random shoes.

03:28.120 --> 03:31.039
Mind you, it feels kinda familiar.

03:32.119 --> 03:38.520
You know what, whatever's happened, all of a
sudden, I'm somewhere I've always wanted to be.

03:41.480 --> 03:43.525
Let's back up a bit.

03:43.560 --> 03:49.279
I mean, every story's got a
beginning. I think mine began here...

03:52.200 --> 03:56.605
The final of the Interschool
Maths Competition, 1992.

03:56.640 --> 04:02.319
I used to be a maths head. Binary coding,
topology, quadratics, I loved stuff like that.

04:02.354 --> 04:04.800
And I'm supposed to be
really good at it.

04:04.835 --> 04:08.199
And Rushmore, a mountainous 42...

04:09.919 --> 04:14.324
So we congratulate
the winning team - Rushmore...

04:14.359 --> 04:19.759
Dad took the day off work to come and
see me, but when the moment mattered,

04:19.793 --> 04:21.365
I blanked,

04:21.399 --> 04:23.219
let the side down,

04:23.254 --> 04:25.039
made a mess of it.

04:28.159 --> 04:31.080
Everyone blamed me
for losing the final...

04:32.239 --> 04:37.759
.. but it must have been what happened
afterwards that started this whole thing off.

04:43.880 --> 04:48.039
Have you ever had a proper look
at the collection? No, sir.

04:48.074 --> 04:51.240
Would you like to? No, sir.

04:51.275 --> 04:53.117
I play golf.

04:53.152 --> 04:54.925
Oh. Good, sir.

04:54.960 --> 04:58.604
I play golf. And one day when
I was playing really badly...

04:58.639 --> 05:02.239
I was stuck in the first bunker
whacking away at all the sand...

05:04.239 --> 05:09.320
.. and this fell out of the sky,
and landed - plop! - beside me.

05:09.355 --> 05:11.724
From the sky? Yeah.

05:11.759 --> 05:16.079
It looks a bit like a golf ball, so I
picked it up and put it in my pocket.

05:16.114 --> 05:19.519
But when I had a proper look
later... Here.

05:19.554 --> 05:21.760
I realised it was an eye.

05:21.795 --> 05:24.004
And I thought, well,

05:24.039 --> 05:26.444
"Where could that have come from?"

05:26.479 --> 05:30.240
It fell from the sky.
Isn't that amazing?

05:32.719 --> 05:34.240
Have it.

05:39.799 --> 05:42.125
Where the bloody hell
have you been?!

05:42.160 --> 05:47.840
Good evening... Good evening.
Come on, Eugene.

05:50.479 --> 05:51.720
Have you got everything?

05:52.920 --> 05:55.840
Yes. Thanks, sir.

05:58.119 --> 05:59.924
I went to the school, didn't I!

05:59.959 --> 06:02.560
'Dad was mad at me
for losing the final.

06:04.159 --> 06:06.205
'But now I had the eye.

06:06.240 --> 06:11.279
'And what I realised was, if it fell
from the sky, it probably... '

06:11.314 --> 06:17.359
No... No, it almost certainly
belonged to an alien.

06:17.394 --> 06:19.639
HIS MUM AND DAD ARGUE

06:20.760 --> 06:22.839
DOOR SLAMS

06:33.480 --> 06:36.519
That was the night Dad went away.

06:38.599 --> 06:44.139
But it was OK, because I had the eye,
and the possibility of an alien encounter.

06:44.174 --> 06:49.680
I mean, if you leave something really
important behind, you come back and get it.

06:49.715 --> 06:52.684
Don't you?

06:52.719 --> 06:57.159
I wanted that alien to come back and claim
his eye more than I wanted anything in my life.

06:57.194 --> 07:02.044
I worked out the possible provenance,
the life form and galaxy,

07:02.079 --> 07:06.519
planetary escape velocities, launch
windows, necessary fuel capacities,

07:06.554 --> 07:08.804
and then, I waited.

07:08.839 --> 07:13.484
# There's a star man
waiting in the sky

07:13.519 --> 07:18.079
# He'd like to come and meet us
but he thinks he'll blow our minds

07:18.114 --> 07:22.440
# There's a star man
waiting in the sky

07:22.475 --> 07:25.097
# He's told us not to... #

07:25.132 --> 07:27.685
My dad never came back.

07:27.720 --> 07:32.440
As I got older, I became interested
in UFOs, collected alien artefacts,

07:32.475 --> 07:36.199
watched the stars
and waited alone for my alien.

07:36.234 --> 07:38.045
'And then,

07:38.080 --> 07:41.804
'I found you, Gwen Cooper. '

07:41.839 --> 07:46.639
Hi, I'm Eugene Jones and, er, I have
a keen interest in your work and, er...

07:46.674 --> 07:50.400
I've got something to...
I'd just like to show... Hi.

07:50.435 --> 07:54.400
Hi. OK, what it is...
Look, I've got to go.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.479
'But I couldn't quite make contact. '

08:05.599 --> 08:08.044
Hmm, you again.

08:08.079 --> 08:10.999
Gwen, I've got this thing
I really need to show you.

08:11.034 --> 08:13.080
Sorry, that sounded...

08:15.199 --> 08:20.440
'I couldn't get you interested in
the eye, no matter how hard I tried. '

08:21.600 --> 08:24.919
Are you sure it's my Eugene?

08:29.000 --> 08:30.685
Yes, Mrs Jones.

08:30.720 --> 08:34.799
Perhaps
you couldn't really identify him.

08:34.833 --> 08:36.280
We could.

08:40.440 --> 08:42.159
That's his tea there.

08:51.600 --> 08:52.920
Shit!

08:58.639 --> 09:00.719
What are we doing here?

09:00.754 --> 09:02.639
Look at this.

09:07.360 --> 09:12.319
Do you understand what's happened
to your brother, Terry? Yeah. What?

09:12.354 --> 09:14.880
He walked into a road
and got run over.

09:19.480 --> 09:23.320
Where's your dad? He works for a big
corporation in America.

09:23.355 --> 09:25.280
Gwen?

09:33.120 --> 09:37.440
That's pre-Gorgon Pilurian currency. I had
them authenticated. Are these Roman coins?

09:37.475 --> 09:42.479
Hey, look, Rice Krispies. Man,
there are some rogues out there.

09:42.514 --> 09:46.165
Oh, hang on,
there's something missing here.

09:46.200 --> 09:49.519
Mrs Jones, do you know what's
missing from Eugene's collection?

09:49.554 --> 09:51.925
Why didn't they stop?

09:51.960 --> 09:55.320
They killed my boy
and just drove on...

09:57.800 --> 09:59.759
Excuse me.

10:07.119 --> 10:09.240
I am sorry, Mrs Jones.

10:11.920 --> 10:14.765
Look, Mum, I'm sorry,

10:14.800 --> 10:19.360
but we've got the best team ever
working on this. Torchwood, me - top!

10:19.395 --> 10:21.965
We'll get it sorted, Mum.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.839
See, I think
there's probably been some mistake.

10:25.874 --> 10:28.297
So... So...

10:28.332 --> 10:30.720
I gotta go.

10:43.039 --> 10:46.159
I want to know what he last ate,
where he'd been...

10:46.194 --> 10:47.400
Oh, wow!

10:48.399 --> 10:51.240
This is... This is...

10:51.275 --> 10:53.045
I am totally...

10:53.080 --> 10:56.320
Christ almighty!
The Head of Vexor 11.

10:56.355 --> 10:58.957
No way!

10:58.992 --> 11:01.525
And... Wow!

11:01.560 --> 11:04.285
A hand... In a jar.

11:04.320 --> 11:09.880
What was he doing out on that road? Fuck
knows. Categorising chevrons. He was a geek.

11:09.915 --> 11:14.804
Ah, this is truly legendary.

11:14.839 --> 11:20.040
Gwen, he had a bit of a thing about you,
and now you're feeling guilty. Sod off, Owen.

11:20.075 --> 11:23.805
You do it, then.
I do it? The autopsy?

11:23.840 --> 11:28.440
Yes. I've got a stack of admin.
OK. Good. You're sure? Yes.

11:28.475 --> 11:30.557
Really? Yes.

11:30.592 --> 11:32.640
I am in heaven.

11:34.320 --> 11:35.760
Am I?

11:37.360 --> 11:39.559
Is that...?

11:41.039 --> 11:44.879
Number three scalpel.
Start at the sternum. Piece of piss.

11:44.914 --> 11:48.565
OK, here we go.

11:48.600 --> 11:53.760
This is also new to me, but
in an investigation like this...

11:58.839 --> 12:02.404
OK, a red Vauxhall has been stopped
outside Caernarfon.

12:02.439 --> 12:07.959
Very drunk guy has admitted knocking a man
over near Cardiff. Fit's Eugene's description.

12:07.994 --> 12:13.479
The man says he thought he'd be OK, so he drove
on. Ah, he was a sweet guy. That's very sad.

12:13.514 --> 12:17.359
Now, can we get on
with some proper work, please?

12:19.239 --> 12:24.360
# Hope there's someone
who'll take care of me

12:24.395 --> 12:27.297
# When I die

12:27.332 --> 12:30.199
# Will I go?

12:32.599 --> 12:37.279
# Hope there's someone
who'll set my heart free

12:37.314 --> 12:42.279
# Nice to hold when I'm tired

12:43.800 --> 12:48.999
# There's a ghost on the horizon

12:49.034 --> 12:53.920
# When I go to bed

12:56.599 --> 13:00.999
# How can I fall asleep at night?

13:01.034 --> 13:06.919
# How will I rest my head?

13:08.479 --> 13:12.719
# I'm scared of the middle place

13:12.754 --> 13:18.040
# Or paralyse in light

13:19.879 --> 13:24.119
# And godsend I don't want to go... #

13:24.154 --> 13:28.324
Do you think Eugene
committed suicide?

13:28.359 --> 13:32.039
It was a road accident
and there was no alien involved.

13:32.074 --> 13:35.719
See, I'm not so sure because
something seems really odd.

13:35.754 --> 13:38.284
I mean, I just...

13:38.319 --> 13:42.644
I just feel that
there's something going on.

13:42.679 --> 13:47.200
Marvellous. Thank you for that Disney
moment. Now, who's making the tea?

13:47.235 --> 13:51.284
I suppose Eugene's a bit odd and
a real local and amateur for you.

13:51.319 --> 13:56.199
Why is it that only Gwen seems to have a heart? I don't
know if you've noticed but the rest of us are human

13:56.234 --> 14:01.640
and amazingly we still manage to get on with our
jobs. OK, you two... OK, fine. Leave it, forget it.

14:03.199 --> 14:05.160
I have.

14:21.400 --> 14:23.559
Is that Eugene's DVD?

14:23.594 --> 14:25.199
No.

14:26.320 --> 14:27.485
Yes!

14:27.520 --> 14:32.640
It was on loan from a video store. You were
nicking his stuff? I was going to take it back.

14:34.240 --> 14:36.679
I'll do it. Suits me.

14:36.714 --> 14:39.119
There'll be a fine.

14:55.999 --> 14:58.399
I'm going to go for some lunch.

14:58.434 --> 15:00.319
All right.

15:06.960 --> 15:10.640
Hi. Do you know when the video shop
round the corner opens?

15:10.675 --> 15:14.285
No, he's a law unto himself.
Gwen! What are you doing here?

15:14.320 --> 15:18.724
This is my lunch cafe. This is... Do
you know someone called Eugene Jones?

15:18.759 --> 15:23.520
That's me! That's me. Middle height. Sandy hair.
Ordinary looking... Nope. What can I do for you?

15:23.555 --> 15:27.799
I come in here every day. Two eggs, ham
and chips. Two eggs, ham and chips, please.

15:29.440 --> 15:32.485
So...

15:32.520 --> 15:36.799
Wow, this is so weird.
I used to follow YOU around.

15:36.834 --> 15:39.080
Now you're following me!

15:40.600 --> 15:41.760
Yeah.

15:47.279 --> 15:49.800
No, you see,
I don't know whose those are.

15:51.879 --> 15:54.199
I can't remember anything, except...

15:55.919 --> 15:58.519
Phone Gary. He might know something.

15:58.554 --> 16:00.600
Phone Gary, phone Gary...

16:08.040 --> 16:11.125
'Hi, this is Gary.
Please leave a message. '

16:11.160 --> 16:15.360
Hi, my name is Gwen Cooper. I have
some very bad news for you, Gary.

16:19.080 --> 16:21.280
I'll give you a call back later.

16:21.315 --> 16:24.124
That is so beautiful.

16:24.159 --> 16:27.919
These ancient creatures have had
their day.

16:30.679 --> 16:33.324
All over these lush fern prairies

16:33.359 --> 16:36.280
a grim evolutionary battle
has broken out

16:36.315 --> 16:38.479
among the newer types of reptile...

16:38.514 --> 16:40.165
Hello.

16:40.200 --> 16:44.005
Hi, gorgeous. Want to borrow
a dream? No, thank you.

16:44.040 --> 16:47.240
I want to return some DVDs on
behalf of someone who's deceased.

16:47.275 --> 16:51.599
Deceased? No shit.
That's pretty final. Eugene Jones.

16:53.519 --> 16:58.119
Hey, I think he used
to come in here, with a mate.

16:58.154 --> 17:00.925
Bit of a dreamer, kind of...
Irresistible?

17:00.960 --> 17:06.079
Ordinary looking. Yeah. He was killed in
a road accident. That's bad. Sweet guy.

17:06.114 --> 17:09.565
£34, please. £34?!

17:09.599 --> 17:14.358
Yeah. Sorry. He's had 'em out ages.
I haven't seen him in months.

17:14.394 --> 17:18.199
I don't think I can bend the rules,
just cos he's dead.

17:18.233 --> 17:20.760
Bread-head bastard. Sorry, Gwen.
That's OK.

17:22.960 --> 17:25.525
Did he, er...?

17:25.560 --> 17:28.920
Did he walk
into the oncoming traffic?

17:28.955 --> 17:31.285
See, lot a people come in here.

17:31.320 --> 17:36.680
They don't want to be themselves any more, they want
to be someone else. They want me to transport them.

17:36.715 --> 17:40.279
How about you, baby? Oh, leave
it out. I'm fine, thank you.

17:40.314 --> 17:42.644
How about you? Me?

17:42.679 --> 17:46.924
I'm outta here. Moving to London in a
couple of months. You know what I'm sayin'?

17:46.959 --> 17:54.160
You see, no disrespect, but Eugene had "loser"
written through him like "Brighton" in a stick of rock.

17:54.195 --> 17:57.920
Maybe he just couldn't live
with his... failure.

17:59.880 --> 18:01.840
You wanna write a cheque?

18:03.119 --> 18:05.004
Failure?

18:05.039 --> 18:09.644
Is that right? Has my life
just been one big failure?

18:09.679 --> 18:13.244
I mean, maybe I never quite lived up
to my early promises of maths genius,

18:13.279 --> 18:17.880
but that's because I was waiting for the
alien to collect his eye and change my life.

18:17.915 --> 18:23.320
And while I was waiting,
I joined Passmore Telesales.

18:23.355 --> 18:27.685
Oh, yes.
This is all nauseatingly familiar.

18:27.720 --> 18:31.639
'Selling kitchens, home insurance,
barbeque sets.

18:31.674 --> 18:35.680
'Selling life and... still waiting. '

18:35.715 --> 18:37.804
Jason!

18:37.839 --> 18:41.719
Kevin! The guy
with the personal hygiene problem.

18:41.754 --> 18:43.880
Nothing changes, really.

18:43.915 --> 18:46.205
Hi, Morag.

18:46.240 --> 18:48.004
Me and Morag used to go out.

18:48.039 --> 18:52.639
So, how come I can remember the
details of my fascinating daily life,

18:52.674 --> 18:55.645
but the vital couple of weeks
before I died

18:55.680 --> 18:59.119
are still a complete mystery to me?
Are you Gary?

18:59.154 --> 19:01.605
Yeah, yeah. How do you, er...?

19:01.640 --> 19:06.799
Are you... Gwen, yes. I was just wondering
whether you saw Eugene the day he died.

19:06.834 --> 19:08.885
No. Sorry.

19:08.920 --> 19:10.799
Just doing a card. You know...

19:12.559 --> 19:17.080
"Good luck in your new job"?!
He's dead. No! Who's it for, then?

19:17.115 --> 19:19.645
His mum, you idiot! Shit.

19:19.680 --> 19:22.484
Can you rub it out? It's in Biro.

19:22.519 --> 19:27.000
People just don't understand.
Don't worry, mate, it's OK.

19:27.035 --> 19:29.084
Is it true?

19:29.119 --> 19:32.119
He got run over? Yeah.

19:32.154 --> 19:34.124
Oh, God.

19:34.159 --> 19:38.119
Sorry. I'm Linda.
I'm a Silver Seller.

19:39.360 --> 19:41.925
It's all about belief, see?

19:41.960 --> 19:45.920
If necessary,
I am Kitchens For A Lifetime.

19:45.955 --> 19:48.437
Eugene was only ever himself.

19:48.472 --> 19:50.884
He wasn't the best salesman then?

19:50.919 --> 19:55.880
No. I think Craig kept him on
out of the goodness of his heart.

19:55.915 --> 19:58.840
Have you met Craig? Is he your boss?

19:58.875 --> 20:00.644
Are you two an item?

20:00.679 --> 20:03.284
A snog in the ladies'
at the Christmas party.

20:03.319 --> 20:07.279
But I can't talk about it here cos
of Craig's, you know... position.

20:07.314 --> 20:09.320
Do you want to meet lunchtime
for a chat?

20:10.999 --> 20:13.805
OK. Where does Gary sit?

20:13.840 --> 20:17.239
Number 50. OK, thank you. Thanks.

20:25.720 --> 20:27.679
MOBILE RINGS

20:28.759 --> 20:32.405
Owen. 'Gwen, Jack wants to know
where you are. ' Yeah, sorry.

20:32.440 --> 20:37.039
I had a few things to sort out. I'll be
back later. 'Yeah, well, make it quick. '

20:41.960 --> 20:46.080
Well, one day Eugene came in,
very low. Why? Why was he low?

20:46.115 --> 20:48.404
He wouldn't talk about it.

20:48.439 --> 20:51.485
Anyway, I was fed up too
because Craig had...

20:51.520 --> 20:56.320
Well, anyway, I said, I'd love to get
away from it all and go to Australia.

20:56.355 --> 21:00.640
Eugene suddenly got very excited.
He said, "Yes! You've got to go. "

21:00.675 --> 21:03.240
I said,
"But I haven't got the money,"

21:03.275 --> 21:05.644
and he said he'd get it for me.

21:05.679 --> 21:09.839
So he was going to pay for a ticket for you to
go to Australia with him? Was he in love with you?

21:09.874 --> 21:12.600
Oh, no! He loved someone
he said was unattainable.

21:15.239 --> 21:19.004
He was just trying to look after me.
He said,

21:19.039 --> 21:25.279
"Don't stay here and waste your life waiting
for something that may never happen. "

21:25.314 --> 21:27.576
Where was he going to get
the money from? Exactly.

21:27.611 --> 21:29.804
You said, "You haven't bought socks
in six years. "

21:29.839 --> 21:33.280
I said, "You haven't even had
a new pair of socks in six years. "

21:33.315 --> 21:37.959
He stood up, and he said...
MOBILE RINGS That's your phone.

21:37.994 --> 21:40.616
Yeah, he said...? He said,

21:40.651 --> 21:43.239
"I'm going to sell it. "

21:43.274 --> 21:45.884
I said, "What?"

21:45.919 --> 21:51.199
He said, "My alien artefact. " So...?
So...? So he brought it in to work.

21:57.400 --> 22:03.164
It's a plastic eye! It's an alien body
part, and I'm going to sell it on eBay.

22:03.199 --> 22:07.999
Eugene, it's very nice of you, but I don't
think that's going to get me the bus into town,

22:08.034 --> 22:10.000
let alone a flight to Sydney.

22:12.640 --> 22:18.040
Some people laughed. But he went
ahead, and of course, it just sat there.

22:18.075 --> 22:21.240
She said maybe a photo,
a bit more of a description...

22:21.275 --> 22:24.000
Then, out of the blue - £2.50.

22:24.035 --> 22:26.204
A kid from Birmingham.

22:26.239 --> 22:30.120
And then...
Eugene, you got a couple more bids.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.924
Bloody hell! 75 quid!

22:32.959 --> 22:35.400
That was just the beginning.

22:35.435 --> 22:38.645
200... 300...

22:38.680 --> 22:42.720
1,000... They just kept on going up.

22:42.755 --> 22:45.764
£3,000! For a spare body part.

22:45.799 --> 22:50.400
Pete said you can get a bathroom suite with
a celebrity appearance for less than that!

22:50.435 --> 22:52.200
Then one day, it just...

22:52.235 --> 22:53.999
jumped.

22:57.240 --> 22:59.439
Oh, my God, Eugene, you're rich!

23:03.240 --> 23:06.284
£15,005.50.

23:06.319 --> 23:09.099
Who bought it? Who bought it?

23:09.134 --> 23:11.845
I've no idea. Is it all my fault?

23:11.880 --> 23:17.080
Of course it's not!
MOBILE RINGS I'm sorry.

23:17.115 --> 23:19.604
Hello? 'Hi, it's Eugene's mum. '

23:19.639 --> 23:24.960
Mrs Jones? 'There's something I think
you should see. ' OK. I'll come over.

23:24.995 --> 23:28.559
That was Eugene's mum.
Sorry, I'm going to have to go.

23:28.594 --> 23:30.040
I'm sorry.

23:37.160 --> 23:42.360
There he is... my son at the
Interschool Maths Final. Big moment.

23:42.395 --> 23:45.365
Youngest contestant in Wales.

23:45.400 --> 23:50.560
So, it's down to the wire, the
last question will settle the final.

23:50.595 --> 23:54.920
What curve is represented by
y- squared = 4ax?

23:57.600 --> 24:02.239
Come on. You got a brain the size of Cardiff
Arms Park! What's the friggin' problem?!

24:02.274 --> 24:06.959
What curve is represented by
y- squared = 4ax? Don't do this.

24:06.994 --> 24:09.199
Don't let me down, boy.

24:09.234 --> 24:11.324
No?

24:11.359 --> 24:14.239
DING!
Time's up. No additional points.

24:14.274 --> 24:16.765
The final scores are...

24:16.800 --> 24:21.280
I don't understand. Someone gave him
the eye as a consolation prize?

24:21.315 --> 24:25.479
Yeah, it was that Mr Garrett,
the science teacher.

24:25.514 --> 24:27.005
A plastic eye!

24:27.040 --> 24:29.525
As a consolation prize!

24:29.560 --> 24:33.960
Still, Eugene treasured it. That was
the night Dad walked out. Went away.

24:33.995 --> 24:37.565
You can stop now, Mum.
What do you mean? He's dead.

24:37.600 --> 24:43.080
He may have been able to square the root of the
square root, but he couldn't cross the road! Terry!

24:43.115 --> 24:47.165
He sold the eye online.

24:47.200 --> 24:49.364
So something must have happened.

24:49.399 --> 24:55.360
Dad left when he found out Eugene was a failure.
That's what Eugene said. None of that's true.

24:55.395 --> 24:57.965
He went cos of his job.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.879
He has a very important job.

25:00.914 --> 25:03.724
Does Mr Jones know about Eugene?

25:03.759 --> 25:07.645
Well, you see, he works for
a big corporation

25:07.680 --> 25:13.920
in America. Stop giving us that shit! He's not
Superman, Mum! He works at a garage on Filey Road.

25:13.955 --> 25:17.719
Eugene found him about two weeks
ago. He found him on the internet.

25:17.754 --> 25:19.719
He's a cashier. Works nights.

25:27.160 --> 25:30.079
Oh, God, now I remember
why I sold the eye.

25:34.999 --> 25:37.924
Life can be such a let down,
can't it?

25:37.959 --> 25:43.279
All those years I'd believed my dad had
gone to America because I was a failure.

25:43.314 --> 25:48.600
And here he was, all along, doing his
important secret work in Filey Road, Cardiff.

25:48.635 --> 25:52.925
When I found him,
I couldn't even bear to say hello.

25:52.960 --> 25:56.360
I'd spent my life believing
in stupid stories, fantasies.

25:56.395 --> 25:59.005
I've wasted my life.

25:59.040 --> 26:02.680
Once I'd seen him there, everything
I'd dreamed about was like rubbish,

26:02.715 --> 26:07.759
just a crock of shit,
including the eye.

26:07.794 --> 26:10.165
So why not sell it?

26:10.200 --> 26:14.159
Along with the woodworm
treatment and loft insulation,

26:14.194 --> 26:17.679
and all the other crap floating
round the world.

26:17.714 --> 26:20.079
Linda was welcome to the money.

26:20.114 --> 26:22.119
No! No! NO! Don't, Gwen!

26:27.480 --> 26:29.319
I don't want anything to do with him.

26:34.399 --> 26:36.319
I'm sorry.

26:36.354 --> 26:38.239
It's OK.

26:58.080 --> 27:00.439
You turned your phone off.

27:02.319 --> 27:04.604
It was Eugene.

27:04.639 --> 27:07.999
He didn't understand
why his father left.

27:08.034 --> 27:10.325
He just needs a bit of help.

27:10.360 --> 27:13.359
To do what? He's dead!
Yes, Jack, I know he's dead, but...

27:13.394 --> 27:15.840
This is not sounding good, Gwen.

27:15.875 --> 27:18.277
I've got work to do. OK.

27:18.312 --> 27:20.644
Eh? No. You can't just stop.

27:20.679 --> 27:24.599
I mean, what about the £15,000?
Gwen? Gwen! OK. Listen to this.

27:24.634 --> 27:28.519
Eugene had an alien eye in his
collection. He sold it online.

27:28.554 --> 27:30.959
What, like a sixth eye?

27:30.994 --> 27:33.439
A Dogon sixth eye?

27:33.474 --> 27:35.924
Maybe.

27:35.959 --> 27:38.764
It's possible.
There was a trade in them.

27:38.799 --> 27:42.360
Who's got it? I don't know, but
I've nearly tracked it down.

27:42.395 --> 27:45.765
What exactly is a sixth eye?
I mean, exactly?

27:45.800 --> 27:49.039
It's one in the back. Let's you
see behind you, where you've been.

27:49.074 --> 27:52.204
Kind of puts things in perspective.

27:52.239 --> 27:55.800
It's useful, fun, slightly terrifying,
that's why they were in demand.

27:55.835 --> 27:58.959
See? See? I told you.
I can get it for you.

27:58.994 --> 28:00.877
My alien...

28:00.912 --> 28:02.725
See? See?

28:02.760 --> 28:05.600
OK, you've got the weekend.

28:05.635 --> 28:07.977
But keep your phone on.

28:08.012 --> 28:10.486
God, you are brilliant.

28:10.521 --> 28:12.925
And I'm brilliant too.

28:12.960 --> 28:18.759
Oh, yeah, of course, Gary and me were
going to go to that talk in Aberystwyth.

28:18.794 --> 28:22.497
Black holes and anti-matter were
pretty important to me and Gary, but

28:22.532 --> 28:26.200
if I'm going to spend a night by the
sea, I know who I'd rather be with.

28:27.759 --> 28:30.239
I'd trust you with my life

28:30.274 --> 28:32.719
if, you know, I still had one.

29:08.119 --> 29:09.079
Gary?

29:21.199 --> 29:22.760
I'm not proud of what I've done.

29:25.320 --> 29:31.680
You hiked the bid? I created three or four online
aliases, and used them to inflate the price.

29:31.715 --> 29:33.524
But why?

29:33.559 --> 29:37.759
At first, just to cheer him up.
He was miserable.

29:37.794 --> 29:39.559
But then the bidding
took off and we got...

29:39.594 --> 29:43.484
I mean, I was involved at first.

29:43.519 --> 29:46.920
I was just helping Eugene make money,
and then one morning...

29:48.480 --> 29:49.959
Gary!

29:52.279 --> 29:54.400
Gary, I think it's him.

29:54.435 --> 29:56.479
Who? The alien.

29:56.514 --> 29:58.084
My alien.

29:58.119 --> 30:01.605
I think he's come back to
claim what's rightfully his.

30:01.640 --> 30:06.159
Gary, I'd stopped believing in him. I mean,
I thought I was just a total sucker but...

30:06.194 --> 30:08.920
Who else would be bidding this
kind of money for a prosthetic eye?

30:10.479 --> 30:12.360
He couldn't contact me any other way.

30:12.395 --> 30:14.884
So he chose eBay? Cyberspace.

30:14.919 --> 30:18.520
I mean, even an online auction
has a certain elegant symmetry.

30:20.119 --> 30:22.805
I think I'm finally
going to meet him.

30:22.840 --> 30:28.359
Well, I was doubtful at first, you know, and then suddenly, out of nowhere
- bam!

30:28.394 --> 30:33.000
15,000. I mean, the bid jumped
to a cool cowin' 15,000.

30:33.035 --> 30:35.240
Yeah. Yeah. I remember us talking.

30:35.275 --> 30:38.439
I thought it was £15,005.50.

30:38.474 --> 30:40.285
Yeah, it was, yeah.

30:40.320 --> 30:43.400
I mean, I wouldn't spend that
kind of money unless it was my own

30:43.435 --> 30:47.279
personal private body part
or something. Would you? No.

30:47.314 --> 30:50.884
No. No way! I remember, yes.

30:50.919 --> 30:56.920
I waited a couple of days and then I got an email
telling me to come to, er... come to a restaurant.

30:56.955 --> 30:59.524
You saw Eugene the day he died,
didn't you?

30:59.559 --> 31:03.160
Yeah, I met up with him before
he went to meet the alien.

31:03.195 --> 31:04.684
I had a cup of coffee.

31:04.719 --> 31:06.845
He was scared. Was I? Course I was.

31:06.880 --> 31:10.920
So he went to make the exchange -
£15005.50 for the eye, right?

31:10.955 --> 31:14.839
And this was somewhere on the
A48 perhaps? Or not. Or not?

31:14.874 --> 31:16.765
Eugene was very secretive.

31:16.800 --> 31:19.179
Could have been in Splott? Splott?

31:19.214 --> 31:21.524
That doesn't sound right, mate.

31:21.559 --> 31:23.119
Who are these people with you, Gary?

31:25.920 --> 31:28.680
Why would Eugene take
a photo of your shoes?

31:28.715 --> 31:30.924
And, whose are the other shoes?

31:30.959 --> 31:33.039
They're just random shoes,
I should think.

31:35.400 --> 31:37.320
I miss him.

31:54.880 --> 32:00.919
Yes, yes, I can remember! I called a taxi,
and then, then I put the eye in a freezer bag.

32:00.954 --> 32:06.240
And then there was... Yes, I was
walking up this road going up towards...

32:06.275 --> 32:09.844
um, a shiny building with...

32:09.879 --> 32:12.840
a great door which
said something about...

32:12.875 --> 32:14.319
something about...

32:16.719 --> 32:20.079
Happiness.

32:26.040 --> 32:27.840
I don't want you to
find out what happened.

32:29.400 --> 32:31.279
I don't want this to end.

32:33.839 --> 32:37.479
I love you.

33:27.439 --> 33:29.560
I thought we were on holiday.

33:40.999 --> 33:42.764
Yes.

33:42.799 --> 33:44.405
Yes... this is it.

33:44.440 --> 33:49.159
We came up the hill, and there
it was! There it was, the...

33:52.680 --> 33:54.360
The Happy Cook?

34:10.998 --> 34:14.679
Yeah, I walked towards the door,
wondering who exactly I would be

34:14.715 --> 34:20.399
meeting, excited, quite stressed,
shitting myself frankly.

34:20.434 --> 34:23.320
I opened the door...

34:23.355 --> 34:25.217
I walked in,

34:25.252 --> 34:27.043
and saw...

34:27.079 --> 34:29.559
I've been looking for a pair
of shoes like that for ages.

34:29.594 --> 34:31.964
And saw...

34:31.998 --> 34:35.438
And saw... my mates.

34:50.600 --> 34:53.445
Hi, guys. Good to see you,

34:53.480 --> 34:56.364
but erm... I've got the rendezvous.

34:56.399 --> 35:00.800
It's us.
I know but... he won't want a crowd.

35:00.835 --> 35:02.845
I'm meeting the buyer.

35:02.880 --> 35:07.719
I'm meeting the alien.
We ARE the alien, man.

35:07.754 --> 35:09.637
We bought it.

35:09.672 --> 35:11.485
What? Here.

35:11.520 --> 35:13.045
What are you having?

35:13.080 --> 35:17.280
Erm... I'll have a milkshake,
thank you. Banana.

35:17.315 --> 35:21.799
Yeah. So we are the official buyers.

35:21.834 --> 35:24.120
Can we see the merchandise?

35:32.800 --> 35:36.085
I don't quite know what
you're trying to tell me here.

35:36.120 --> 35:39.480
See, we did it as a joke to cheer you up.
We didn't think we'd be the actual buyers.

35:39.515 --> 35:44.199
Then he said you said you thought
it was the alien, and we thought...

35:44.234 --> 35:46.516
well, that's funny, innit?

35:46.551 --> 35:48.764
Come on, Eugene, get real.

35:48.799 --> 35:51.599
But then we thought,
"Let him dream, man.

35:51.634 --> 35:55.445
"Life's short and really boring. "

35:55.480 --> 35:57.800
So then
we went on betting and then...

35:57.835 --> 36:01.600
You bid 15,000 for the eye?

36:01.635 --> 36:03.485
Not us. No. No way.

36:03.520 --> 36:05.965
It turns out there
was real interest.

36:06.000 --> 36:09.085
Someone else bid the fifteen
thou, but then HE got greedy.

36:09.120 --> 36:11.640
Ketchup, please. He just couldn't
resist one more measly little bid.

36:11.675 --> 36:15.679
£15,005.50. And then, well nothing.

36:15.714 --> 36:17.365
Nada. Endville.

36:17.400 --> 36:20.659
OK, shut the fuck up, Gary.

36:20.694 --> 36:23.367
Point is, we bought it.

36:23.402 --> 36:26.040
We are the purchasers.

36:26.075 --> 36:28.645
Ta-dah!

36:28.680 --> 36:32.840
So you've got
£15,005.50 on you, have you?

36:32.875 --> 36:34.964
We've got £34.

36:34.999 --> 36:39.439
£34, Eugene. That's not a
poke in the eye, so to speak.

36:39.474 --> 36:41.376
I'm calling a cab.

36:41.411 --> 36:43.279
Hey slow down.

36:46.999 --> 36:49.640
Banana milkshake?
Thank you.

36:51.840 --> 36:55.159
If it's all such a sodding
joke, why do you even want it?

36:55.194 --> 36:57.679
I got a friend
with a visual impairment.

36:59.680 --> 37:01.444
You're going to re-sell
it online, aren't you?

37:01.479 --> 37:08.040
You cheap little gits. You know he's out
there... Who? The alien, and he'll pay anything.

37:08.075 --> 37:12.480
Eugene, man, I'm as partial as the
next guy to a bit of sci-fi but...

37:12.515 --> 37:14.604
A green geezer with six eyes?

37:14.639 --> 37:17.845
Get real, guy.
I checked the bid history.

37:17.880 --> 37:23.359
Mr C Blackstaff is a collector of
alien ephemera and Nazi memorabilia.

37:23.394 --> 37:25.444
Also beanie babies.

37:25.479 --> 37:29.299
Teeny bit cuckoo,
but endearingly rich.

37:29.334 --> 37:33.120
And if he's willing to pay 15,000...

37:37.879 --> 37:39.044
Oi!

37:39.079 --> 37:41.880
So now they're
inconveniencing customers.

37:41.915 --> 37:44.040
You stepped in? Well, I tried.

37:47.040 --> 37:49.959
I didn't really know what
the eye was any more...

37:52.879 --> 37:56.880
.. but I was damned if I was going to
let it go for £34 and a banana milkshake.

38:04.920 --> 38:07.925
Heimlich!

38:07.960 --> 38:11.160
Heimlich! What are you doing? Getting
the goods, idiot! Get the milkshake!

38:16.200 --> 38:17.644
Well, that's just not
acceptable behaviour.

38:17.679 --> 38:22.760
Not at a Happy Cook. They were making
a public spectacle of themselves.

38:28.800 --> 38:31.360
And that was it,
he was out the door and gone.

38:31.395 --> 38:33.617
Oh, my God! That is so weird!

38:33.652 --> 38:35.804
You bastards! You are so dead!

38:35.839 --> 38:39.040
I mean, Josh, you're just a
dickhead, but Gary...

38:39.075 --> 38:41.200
We were... I mean, we were mates.
Hi, doll.

38:41.235 --> 38:43.165
Are you talking to me? Yeah.

38:43.200 --> 38:47.439
Sorry. Look, I don't know whether
you remember us from last week. Yes.

38:47.474 --> 38:51.679
Yeah, now the thing is, there may be
people coming in to ask questions.

38:51.714 --> 38:54.005
A woman specifically. And I think...

38:54.040 --> 38:57.600
Josh... it would be in your best
interests if... Shut up, Josh.

38:57.635 --> 38:59.359
The woman is complying, man.

39:02.719 --> 39:05.760
OK. Cool.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.119
What did you do that for, twat?

39:11.154 --> 39:12.439
I miss him!

39:22.039 --> 39:24.400
So he ran out the door and
you two ran after him? Yeah.

39:24.435 --> 39:25.920
We chased him across the car park.

39:25.955 --> 39:27.564
But Eugene was quite fast.

39:27.599 --> 39:29.560
Josh had new shoes,
he was making a fuss...

39:29.595 --> 39:31.325
Hey, hey... You are overweight.

39:31.360 --> 39:33.919
He hared across the road
and we lost him.

39:33.954 --> 39:36.760
Honest to God.

39:36.795 --> 39:38.404
OK.

39:38.439 --> 39:41.000
That's it.

39:41.035 --> 39:42.965
OK.

39:43.000 --> 39:47.365
All those cars. All those
lives moving through space...

39:47.400 --> 39:53.560
Hello. Can you give me the number for
Filey Garage, Filey Road, Cardiff, please?

39:53.595 --> 39:59.119
All that humanity whizzing by in a
frenzy of burgers and chips,

39:59.154 --> 40:02.477
bank holiday fun, burst
tyres, screaming kids

40:02.512 --> 40:05.800
and sudden heart-attacks.
Put me through, thanks.

40:09.120 --> 40:10.924
Mr Jones?

40:10.959 --> 40:15.899
You don't know me,
but I'm a friend of your son Eugene.

40:15.934 --> 40:20.805
I've got some bad news, I'm afraid.
Now I remember.

40:20.840 --> 40:24.999
Apart from a buzzing in my ear
where Josh whacked me, I felt good.

40:25.034 --> 40:27.760
I was running across a
field on a Saturday morning.

40:27.795 --> 40:30.005
The smell of exhaust
and banana milkshake,

40:30.040 --> 40:36.720
a slight nausea, heart beating too fast cos I wasn't that fit
- all the stuff that tells you you're alive.

40:45.800 --> 40:49.640
By rights, I should
be well pissed off -

40:49.675 --> 40:51.685
my mates had cheated on me

40:51.720 --> 40:55.805
and I didn't meet any aliens, but
I realised that when I swallowed the

40:55.840 --> 41:03.360
eye at the Happy Cook, I was given a chance to look
back on my life and see it for what it really was.

41:03.395 --> 41:07.240
Gary, I'm going to miss you.

41:09.000 --> 41:13.920
Not the biggest turn-out you
could hope for, but still.

41:13.955 --> 41:15.644
I wish I could...

41:15.679 --> 41:19.360
God, Gwen, I wish I could say
thank you.

41:20.920 --> 41:22.999
And here he is...

41:24.960 --> 41:26.645
.. my dad,

41:26.680 --> 41:29.640
only 14 years late.

41:40.359 --> 41:43.880
So, now I know it wasn't
my fault my dad left,

41:43.915 --> 41:47.279
and that, of course,
he wasn't Superman

41:47.314 --> 41:49.804
or an alien,

41:49.839 --> 41:52.600
he's just an ordinary bloke.

41:54.919 --> 41:56.399
Eugene...

42:00.000 --> 42:02.460
He was a good boy,

42:02.495 --> 42:04.885
but somehow...

42:04.920 --> 42:07.999
things went wrong. I wasn't there.

42:09.600 --> 42:12.799
I wish I could have
seen him... before...

42:16.480 --> 42:20.119
An ordinary bloke
who made a mess of things.

42:21.960 --> 42:24.079
# Oh, Danny Boy

42:25.640 --> 42:30.005
# The pipes, the pipes are calling

42:30.040 --> 42:36.940
# From glen to glen
and down the mountainside

42:36.975 --> 42:43.840
# The summer's gone
and all the flowers dying

42:43.875 --> 42:51.160
# Tis you must go
and I must stay behind

42:51.195 --> 42:54.644
# But come ye back

42:54.679 --> 42:59.520
# When summer's in the meadow

42:59.555 --> 43:03.165
# Or when the valley's

43:03.200 --> 43:07.719
# Hushed and white with snow

43:07.754 --> 43:11.079
# And I'll be there

43:11.114 --> 43:13.164
# In sunshine

43:13.199 --> 43:16.359
# And in shadow... #

43:18.720 --> 43:19.880
No!

43:21.199 --> 43:23.605
Not yet.

43:23.640 --> 43:27.485
Dad made a mess of things
and went away,

43:27.520 --> 43:31.719
and that's a shame really,
it's a terrible pity,

43:31.754 --> 43:33.800
because we missed each other.

43:35.400 --> 43:37.039
Completely.

43:50.760 --> 43:52.520
You know, 28 is one of
those perfect numbers.

43:52.555 --> 43:54.759
It's equal to the
sum of its divisors.

43:56.320 --> 43:58.139
I'm 28.

43:58.174 --> 43:59.959
I was 28.

44:02.520 --> 44:04.559
I think I'm going to
have to go soon, Gwen.

44:04.594 --> 44:06.576
Oh, God.

44:06.611 --> 44:08.559
Yeah.

44:10.959 --> 44:15.799
Also, 28 centimetres per second
is the top speed of a lone lobster.

44:15.834 --> 44:18.284
Oh, hi.

44:18.319 --> 44:21.199
Thank you. I'm sorry I
had to ask you to do that.

44:21.234 --> 44:22.680
Yeah, no problem.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.885
So, if it's the eye
that's been keeping me here,

44:35.920 --> 44:39.879
now it's no longer inside me, why
the hell am I still hanging around?

44:45.199 --> 44:46.519
Eugene?

44:50.120 --> 44:53.519
The eye is in the bag now,
rather than in you.

44:53.554 --> 44:55.000
Are you...?

45:05.920 --> 45:08.199
Hello, stranger! Did you get it?
Yeah, I got it.

45:10.999 --> 45:12.725
Impressive.

45:12.760 --> 45:14.959
Well, we haven't done
the tests yet, so...

45:14.994 --> 45:16.724
Come on. We've got to go.

45:16.759 --> 45:20.080
Jack, can you give me five? Yeah.

45:39.279 --> 45:44.405
In an average lifetime, the human
heart will beat two million times.

45:44.440 --> 45:50.599
You'll produce over eight thousand gallons
of saliva and grow 350 miles of hair.

45:52.159 --> 45:54.920
You'll eat the equivalent
in weight of six elephants.

45:54.955 --> 45:59.800
Oh, isn't life amazing! Gwen!

45:59.835 --> 46:04.639
GWEN!

46:20.840 --> 46:23.979
Hi. Oh, my God.

46:24.014 --> 46:27.084
Eugene! Are you OK?

46:27.119 --> 46:29.539
It is so good to see you.

46:29.574 --> 46:31.925
Eugene, you're on my leg.

46:31.960 --> 46:34.520
Sorry! Sorry. No, no, it's fine.

46:34.555 --> 46:37.080
It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.

46:39.080 --> 46:40.685
Can he see me?

46:40.720 --> 46:43.039
He can see me!

46:46.920 --> 46:48.884
Thanks.

46:48.919 --> 46:53.160
No, thank you. Thank you.
You just saved my life.

46:53.195 --> 46:54.720
That's OK.

46:56.359 --> 47:00.840
That's unbelievable.
That's un-bloody-believable.

47:00.875 --> 47:03.364
Oh, God...

47:03.399 --> 47:04.839
I think that's it.

47:13.119 --> 47:15.319
Goodbye, Gwen.

47:20.440 --> 47:23.404
Don't go now, Eugene.

47:23.439 --> 47:25.440
Eugene, please don't go now.

47:27.240 --> 47:29.039
Eugene, please...

47:31.279 --> 47:32.924
Please!

47:32.959 --> 47:39.080
The average life is full of near misses and
absolute hits, of great love and small disasters.

47:39.115 --> 47:44.280
It's made up of banana milkshakes,
loft insulation and random shoes.

47:44.315 --> 47:47.005
It's dead ordinary, and
truly, truly amazing.

47:47.040 --> 47:50.080
What you've got to realise is,
it's all here, now.

47:50.115 --> 47:52.405
So breathe deep and swallow it whole.

47:52.440 --> 47:58.360
Because take it from me, life just whizzes
by, and then, all of a sudden, it's...

48:00.799 --> 48:04.239
At least it wasn't a
spaceship full of aliens.

48:04.274 --> 48:07.204
Which year? I need to know. 1953.

48:07.239 --> 48:11.079
Just three lost people who've
somehow become our responsibility.

48:11.114 --> 48:15.759
A man like you,
out of his time, alone and scared.

48:15.794 --> 48:18.325
I hate this filthy stinking place!

48:18.360 --> 48:21.900
I died once.
It's like two separate worlds.

48:21.935 --> 48:25.440
There's Torchwood... then
there's real life.

48:27.679 --> 48:29.919
I'm scared.
