WEBVTT

00:07.675 --> 00:09.258
Jessica.

00:11.970 --> 00:16.265
Jessica, come on. We gotta go.

00:18.602 --> 00:22.105
- Move it or lose it, sister.
- I don't feel good.

00:28.987 --> 00:31.656
- You don't feel warm.
- My stomach hurts.

00:31.782 --> 00:34.992
- Honey, if you don't have a fever...
- I don't want to go to school.

00:35.119 --> 00:37.328
I can do my work at home.

00:38.080 --> 00:40.289
Jessica, what's wrong?

00:42.793 --> 00:44.419
Everybody hates me.

00:46.714 --> 00:48.089
No, they don't hate you.

00:48.424 --> 00:51.175
They don't even know you,
because they're too ignorant to try.

00:51.301 --> 00:54.512
- I hate myself.
- Jessica, don't say that.

00:55.472 --> 00:58.516
Honey. Look at me.
Look at me.

00:58.892 --> 01:03.688
You are a wonderful,
beautiful little girl.

01:03.939 --> 01:06.649
- Don't let a few bad apples...
- A few?

01:07.109 --> 01:08.943
Try my whole class.

01:10.112 --> 01:12.196
Remember the story
where the guy keeps saying

01:12.322 --> 01:14.031
that he hates green eggs and ham?

01:14.241 --> 01:16.409
And then at the end,
he realized he really loved them?

01:16.660 --> 01:20.997
One day, they're gonna realize
what a great kid you really are.

01:21.248 --> 01:25.668
You just gotta be like Sam-l-Am,
and don't give up.

01:27.296 --> 01:28.588
Okay.

01:31.884 --> 01:34.886
That's it. Keep going.

01:36.638 --> 01:41.309
Good. Nice. You're doing great,
Jessica. You're doing great.

01:44.229 --> 01:48.524
Hey. Hey, Seth. You want to spend
the rest of class sitting on the bench?

01:48.650 --> 01:49.776
No.

01:49.902 --> 01:51.736
Keep going, Jess.
You got 40 more seconds.

01:51.862 --> 01:54.113
- My arm hurts.
- Come on. Tough it up.

01:54.281 --> 01:57.450
- You can do it. You can do it.
- My chest hurts.

01:57.576 --> 02:01.245
- How do you think the ground feels?
- Hey, Seth. Two laps. Bye.

02:01.371 --> 02:05.708
Jess, It's just a stitch. Okay?
Just keep breathing. You got it.

02:05.918 --> 02:08.920
- I can't.
- Only 10 more seconds. You got it.

02:18.931 --> 02:22.183
Jessica? Jessica? Jessica?

02:28.857 --> 02:32.026
Oh, my God. Hey, go to the office.
Get Miss Parsons. Now.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.279
I'm on the playground
at Finley Elementary.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.156
One of my students is
having a heart attack.

02:37.282 --> 02:39.534
Yeah, she's 10.
Don't you think I know that?

02:39.660 --> 02:43.663
Just send the damn ambulance. Come on.
Wake up. Come on, sweetie.

03:19.741 --> 03:24.871
Dr. Bender, 6370.
Dr. Bender, call extension 6370.

03:27.040 --> 03:30.376
You ever seen
an infected pierced scrotum?

03:30.669 --> 03:33.462
No, but I know a few people
on whom I'd like to see it happen.

03:33.589 --> 03:34.964
We need to talk.

03:35.090 --> 03:38.676
Well, if pain's what you're after,
the penis is really the way to go.

03:38.802 --> 03:41.387
- I'd recommend the apadravya.
- We're not talking.

03:41.513 --> 03:43.139
It sounded like we were.

03:43.682 --> 03:47.226
No, you're attempting to avoid talking

03:47.436 --> 03:49.520
because you know what
I want to talk about.

03:49.688 --> 03:50.980
Nipples?

03:51.106 --> 03:52.982
You need to get rid
of one of your people.

03:53.108 --> 03:56.193
Absolutely. As soon as I do
performance reviews.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.279
And then review the reviews, of course.

03:58.405 --> 04:01.657
A decision like this can't be made
without proper, you know, review.

04:01.867 --> 04:03.868
Shouldn't take longer
than a month, maybe two.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.579
Four at the most,
unless it gets complicated.

04:06.705 --> 04:08.414
There's no way out of this.

04:08.540 --> 04:11.500
Get it over with as fast as you can,
like ripping off a band-aid.

04:11.627 --> 04:14.754
Only instead of a two-cent piece
of tape and gauze, it's a human being.

04:14.963 --> 04:17.381
- Like you care.
- Like you don't.

04:21.011 --> 04:23.262
You have a week. Get it done.

04:32.272 --> 04:35.316
We have a referral from Dr. Lenkiewicz.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.693
- Don't know him.
- He knows you.

04:37.819 --> 04:39.695
- What's the problem?
- Heart attack.

04:40.072 --> 04:43.240
- Definitely don't know him.
- The patient's 10.

04:45.202 --> 04:48.454
Ten-year-olds do not have heart attacks.
It's gotta be a mistake.

04:48.580 --> 04:52.875
Right. Simplest explanation is she's a
40-year-old lying about her age.

04:53.168 --> 04:54.877
Maybe an actress trying to hang on.

04:55.003 --> 04:58.130
- I meant maybe the tests were wrong.
- That's what the ER thought.

04:58.256 --> 04:59.757
Three CK-MBs were positive.

04:59.883 --> 05:03.010
The EKG shows classic signs
of ST elevation. It's a heart attack.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.887
She's morbidly obese.

05:05.597 --> 05:07.640
The morbid part of that raises alarms.

05:07.766 --> 05:10.184
It takes decades to eat
your way into a heart attack.

05:10.310 --> 05:13.854
Doesn't take decades to kill yourself.
If I was that fat, I'd be pretty tempted

05:13.981 --> 05:17.024
- to knock back a bottle of pills.
- It's not a drug overdose.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.943
The fatigue, muscle pain
and difficulty concentrating

05:19.069 --> 05:20.444
have been bothering her for over a year.

05:20.570 --> 05:22.780
That's because of her weight,
because of her depression.

05:22.906 --> 05:24.448
That's what five pediatricians,

05:24.574 --> 05:26.784
two nutritionists
and a psychologist said.

05:26.910 --> 05:29.286
The heart attack would seem
to indicate that they missed something.

05:29.413 --> 05:32.540
- It's gotta be something genetic.
- What about metabolic syndrome X?

05:32.666 --> 05:35.209
- Insulin resistance?
- Syndrome X could cause a stroke.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.752
I don't know about a heart attack.

05:36.878 --> 05:39.005
It could, if her blood pressure
was high enough.

05:39.131 --> 05:40.965
Which is likely, considering her weight.

05:41.133 --> 05:43.718
Fits the symptoms. Me likee.

05:43.844 --> 05:46.762
Do a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp.

05:49.141 --> 05:51.267
Oh, and one more thing.

05:52.436 --> 05:57.106
I've been told that I gotta get rid of
one of you guys by the end of the week.

05:58.233 --> 06:01.777
New sheriff. Belt tightening.
You know how it goes.

06:05.782 --> 06:07.533
Okay. Carry on.

06:12.247 --> 06:14.874
Some kind of game.
House's own version of Punk'd.

06:15.042 --> 06:17.960
It's not House. It's Vogler.
We can't let it get to us.

06:18.086 --> 06:19.754
- We've got to stick together.
- Why?

06:19.880 --> 06:22.089
Are you suggesting we start
slashing each other's throats?

06:22.215 --> 06:24.759
I'm suggesting it's a zero-sum game.
Your loss is my win.

06:25.052 --> 06:28.596
- That's not conducive to team play.
- Which is what House seems to want.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.222
Look, I'm with Cameron.

06:30.348 --> 06:34.935
It may be a bad strategy, but I don't
want to give House the satisfaction.

06:35.062 --> 06:37.396
Come on. Sick kid, remember?

06:39.316 --> 06:42.943
- She's diabetic?
- No, but it's similar.

06:43.111 --> 06:45.362
MSX patients
don't respond normally to insulin,

06:45.489 --> 06:47.740
which causes their body
to create too much,

06:47.866 --> 06:51.118
and that leads
to metabolic abnormalities.

06:51.286 --> 06:53.788
We're going to do a test to be sure,
but there are certain dangers.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.874
Is this thing treatable?

06:57.042 --> 06:59.085
It's controllable
through proper diet and exercise.

06:59.211 --> 07:00.753
Wait.

07:01.379 --> 07:05.216
Jessica already eats right,
and she exercises every day.

07:05.342 --> 07:06.884
You've already seen
several nutritionists...

07:07.010 --> 07:08.594
We've done everything
they've recommended.

07:08.720 --> 07:09.678
I understand...

07:09.930 --> 07:13.099
Why can't any of you doctors
see past her weight?

07:15.977 --> 07:21.023
If diet and exercise are the treatment,
then the diagnosis is wrong.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.609
It might be.

07:23.944 --> 07:27.363
But the only way we'll know
is if you let us do this test.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.743
It's really bad,
especially at night.

07:32.953 --> 07:37.581
It's like my heart is on fire.
Like it's, oh, I don't know. Like...

07:38.750 --> 07:41.085
- Burning?
- Exactly.

07:41.753 --> 07:44.505
Sounds almost like heartburn.

07:44.840 --> 07:48.592
- So, can you give me something?
- Like a thesaurus?

07:48.718 --> 07:49.593
What?

07:49.719 --> 07:52.763
I take it you never mentioned this
during any of your prenatal visits.

07:52.889 --> 07:54.640
Prenatal?

07:56.059 --> 07:57.143
I'm not pregnant.

07:57.269 --> 08:00.729
You don't get to make that call unless
you have a stethoscope. Union rules.

08:00.856 --> 08:04.400
I know when I'm pregnant, all right?
I have six kids.

08:04.526 --> 08:07.778
That's why my husband
had a vasectomy, and we use condoms.

08:07.904 --> 08:10.698
Vasectomies can reverse themselves.
Condoms break.

08:10.824 --> 08:15.452
Okay. This is what a woman
is supposed to look like.

08:15.829 --> 08:21.834
Okay? We're not just skin and bones.
We have flesh. We have curves.

08:22.544 --> 08:25.045
You have little people inside you.

08:26.506 --> 08:29.258
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.

08:29.551 --> 08:32.511
I guess I must have just been
brainwashed by the media,

08:32.637 --> 08:35.306
- all those years of medical training.
- Damn right.

08:35.432 --> 08:38.976
I'll see if I can find some antacids
while the nurse gets some blood.

08:39.102 --> 08:42.438
- Blood? Why?
- The heartburn.

08:42.647 --> 08:45.024
Gotta make sure it's not spreading.

08:50.572 --> 08:52.406
I don't want to.

08:52.741 --> 08:55.367
The test involves
some pretty precise measurements.

08:55.493 --> 08:57.578
If we don't know exactly
how much you weigh,

08:57.704 --> 08:59.872
we won't get the right answers.

09:01.333 --> 09:03.709
Let me tell you a secret.

09:03.919 --> 09:06.754
When I was your age, I was heavy, too.

09:06.963 --> 09:08.714
Were you over 100?

09:08.840 --> 09:12.551
Way over. Kids in my neighborhood
used to call me Rerun.

09:12.677 --> 09:14.970
- Rerun?
- He was a heavy guy from TV.

09:15.096 --> 09:17.556
I used to pretend I liked it,
but I didn't.

09:17.682 --> 09:21.602
- How come you're not heavy anymore?
- Ninth grade, grew five inches.

09:21.728 --> 09:25.564
- Everything kind of evened out.
- You think that'll happen to me?

09:25.690 --> 09:29.568
Well, yeah. Your mom's tall, and you
are a little short for your age.

09:29.694 --> 09:31.528
Probably spring right up.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.625
Obesity isn't something
you just grow out of.

09:44.751 --> 09:48.295
- I take it you've never seen a baby?
- She's not a baby. She's 10.

09:48.421 --> 09:51.173
And you figure making her feel like crap
would do her a world of good?

09:51.299 --> 09:53.259
Yeah, if it gets her off the couch.

09:53.385 --> 09:55.469
I'm sure she's already
under enough pressure.

09:55.595 --> 09:56.804
Not from Mummy.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.473
Everything in society tells us
we have to be thin to be successful.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.100
No. Society tells you,

10:01.226 --> 10:03.435
you have to be thin to be attractive.
And guess what?

10:03.561 --> 10:07.022
That's what attractive means,
that society likes looking at you.

10:07.148 --> 10:10.234
I think we should be telling our kids
it's fine as long as they're healthy.

10:10.443 --> 10:13.570
You weigh 90 pounds
because it makes you healthier?

10:13.905 --> 10:16.991
Forget it. He's just
cranky because he knows

10:17.117 --> 10:19.368
he's the one who's gonna get the axe.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.208
So, any thoughts?

10:26.376 --> 10:29.295
On what? Sharon's plan for Gaza?

10:30.463 --> 10:31.547
Who you gonna let go?

10:31.673 --> 10:33.257
I'm thinking I can convince Vogler

10:33.383 --> 10:35.718
it would be more cost-efficient
to keep all of them.

10:35.844 --> 10:37.386
You should be able to pull that off.

10:37.512 --> 10:39.471
Most billionaires
aren't very good with numbers.

10:39.597 --> 10:43.058
It will be more cost-efficient
once I grab Cameron's ass,

10:43.184 --> 10:48.772
call Foreman a spade, and Chase, well,
I'll grab his ass, too.

10:49.065 --> 10:51.191
You are uniquely
talented in many areas,

10:51.318 --> 10:54.111
but office politics is not one of them.

10:54.279 --> 10:56.322
Don't take Vogler on.

10:56.740 --> 10:58.949
- Separate or together?
- Together.

11:03.830 --> 11:06.832
Increasing glucose
to 6.9 milligrams per minute.

11:06.958 --> 11:08.751
- Are you okay?
- I'm thirsty.

11:08.877 --> 11:10.294
Just a little longer and you'll be done.

11:10.420 --> 11:12.129
Like Dr. Chase.

11:12.380 --> 11:14.673
Want to put some money on it?

11:17.135 --> 11:20.262
- I said I'm thirsty.
- Just five more minutes, sweetheart.

11:20.388 --> 11:22.514
I'm not your sweetheart.
Don't call me that.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.850
- That's not nice.
- They're the ones who aren't nice.

11:24.976 --> 11:27.561
You're not, either.
I don't want to do this anymore.

11:27.729 --> 11:30.022
Jessica. Jessica,
you have to calm down.

11:30.148 --> 11:32.107
No. No. Let me go.

11:32.233 --> 11:34.860
Check her blood sugar.
She's got to be getting hypoglycemic.

11:34.986 --> 11:37.196
I've never seen her like this before.
Something's wrong.

11:37.322 --> 11:40.074
Let go of me. Get it out of me.

11:40.241 --> 11:44.036
Let go, you son of a bitch.
You bastard. No.

11:44.829 --> 11:46.038
Help her.

11:52.003 --> 11:55.005
She's sedated.
Mrs. Simms, don't worry.

11:55.131 --> 11:57.383
Hypoglycemia can cause
temporary psychosis,

11:57.509 --> 12:00.469
and is a common complication
during an HEC procedure.

12:00.595 --> 12:02.513
I never wanted it done
in the first place.

12:02.639 --> 12:03.889
We understand you're upset...

12:04.015 --> 12:06.183
You were supposed to be
monitoring her condition,

12:06.309 --> 12:08.102
but instead you were bickering
and placing bets.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.729
I apologize if we weren't devoting
our full attention to your daughter,

12:10.855 --> 12:12.606
- but I assure you that we...
- Oh, please.

12:12.816 --> 12:15.442
Save your pathetic insincerity
for your boyfriend.

12:15.568 --> 12:19.446
You're wrong. She is, in fact,
pathetically sincere.

12:19.739 --> 12:22.491
- And they didn't screw it up.
- Who are you?

12:22.659 --> 12:26.245
I'm from the lab. The blood tests show
your daughter was not hypoglycemic,

12:26.371 --> 12:29.415
which means her psychosis wasn't
caused by anything these doctors did.

12:29.582 --> 12:33.210
- So then what was it caused by?
- I've no idea.

12:34.087 --> 12:38.048
But you'll be happy to hear it cannot
be cured by diet or exercise.

12:48.601 --> 12:53.063
What else could cause
uncontrollable rage in a 10-year-old?

12:53.189 --> 12:55.816
Nothing that could
also cause a heart attack.

12:57.735 --> 12:59.903
I assume
I don't have to point out

13:00.029 --> 13:03.157
that now would be
an extremely good time

13:03.283 --> 13:08.871
for one of you to distinguish yourself
with a brilliant idea.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.626
A hypercoagulable state
can cause a blood clot.

13:14.752 --> 13:16.503
Blood clots can cause a heart attack.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.797
More likely to cause a stroke,
not the psychosis.

13:18.923 --> 13:22.009
No, you're wrong. If a clot made it
to the amygdala area of the brain,

13:22.135 --> 13:23.594
it might cause uncontrollable rage.

13:23.720 --> 13:24.970
Right, because anything's possible,

13:25.096 --> 13:27.431
but nothing's gonna cause
multiple clots in a kid this age.

13:27.557 --> 13:30.058
- She's fat.
- Obesity doesn't cause blood clots.

13:30.185 --> 13:32.853
Extremely obese patients
can get a fat embolus.

13:32.979 --> 13:35.272
Right, after they've had liposuction,
which she's clearly never had.

13:35.398 --> 13:36.231
How do you know?

13:36.357 --> 13:38.025
Because we
have her medical records,

13:38.151 --> 13:40.194
and because no plastic surgeon
in his right mind

13:40.320 --> 13:42.112
is gonna give a 10-year-old liposuction.

13:42.238 --> 13:46.783
Have you ever met a plastic surgeon
who was in their right mind?

13:46.993 --> 13:49.953
- She hasn't had liposuction.
- Thank you.

13:51.289 --> 13:54.041
But what about some other
ridiculous obesity treatment?

13:54.459 --> 13:55.292
Like what?

13:55.418 --> 13:57.920
Diet pills can
cause heart attacks and blood clots.

13:58.046 --> 13:59.796
Her tox screen was negative.

13:59.923 --> 14:01.757
Wouldn't show over-the-counter
weight-loss drugs.

14:01.883 --> 14:03.258
Her mother wouldn't give her diet pills.

14:03.384 --> 14:07.262
She thinks her daughter's perfect
just the way she is.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.473
She's lying.

14:09.641 --> 14:13.519
You two, heparin and warfarin
to prevent further clotting.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.522
And you find those pills.

14:28.076 --> 14:30.786
Not diet pills.

14:30.912 --> 14:33.497
You might want to broaden
the search just a little.

14:33.623 --> 14:36.542
Don't just ask the mom. If she hasn't
mentioned it yet, she's not...

14:36.668 --> 14:39.628
If you're gonna fire someone,
go ahead and do it.

14:39.754 --> 14:41.171
But don't treat us like lab rats,

14:41.297 --> 14:44.675
testing how long it takes
to get us at one another's throats.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.927
- So what should I do?
- I don't give a damn what you do.

14:47.053 --> 14:50.973
Yes, I had noticed
your complete indifference.

14:51.266 --> 14:54.768
You don't even offer
a medical opinion anymore.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.812
Who would you fire?

14:57.313 --> 15:00.315
- Not my call.
- I want your opinion.

15:01.025 --> 15:03.193
Fine, it's you.

15:03.945 --> 15:06.655
Either way, you're making a choice.

15:09.534 --> 15:11.577
Chase.

15:12.203 --> 15:14.413
Because he screwed up
an angio a month ago?

15:14.539 --> 15:18.208
- Anyone can make a mistake.
- Right. So it's the money.

15:18.543 --> 15:21.086
You resent it, but you're gonna tell me
that he doesn't need the job.

15:21.212 --> 15:22.713
He doesn't appreciate the job.

15:22.839 --> 15:24.840
He was ready to go three rounds
with Cameron for it.

15:24.966 --> 15:28.385
He wants the job.
He just doesn't appreciate it.

15:28.553 --> 15:30.512
There's nothing wrong
with wanting to hang out,

15:30.638 --> 15:33.557
but this is not the place to do it.

15:34.517 --> 15:37.769
- I'm surprised.
- You thought I'd pick Cameron?

15:38.438 --> 15:40.939
I didn't think you'd pick at all.

15:46.195 --> 15:49.740
Guess he's not the rise-above-the-fray
guy he'd like us to think he is.

15:49.907 --> 15:51.533
You practically forced it out of him.

15:51.701 --> 15:54.536
He's scared of losing his job,
just like everybody else.

15:54.662 --> 15:57.914
I've been thinking. You've made it quite
clear that you're miserable here.

15:58.041 --> 16:00.917
- I am not miserable.
- You're not happy.

16:01.044 --> 16:04.546
- And you are?
- With my job, yes.

16:04.756 --> 16:07.841
I am exactly where I want to be,
doing exactly what I want to do.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.969
Think I sense
a hint of sarcasm there.

16:11.095 --> 16:13.680
Why don't you pick yourself? Quit.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.807
Hmm, I was wrong.

16:16.267 --> 16:20.520
- About Vogler or Foreman?
- Mrs. Hernandez's pregnancy test.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.272
Who's Mrs. Hernandez?

16:22.398 --> 16:26.568
Either a woman carrying
an alien baby or your newest patient.

16:27.528 --> 16:30.989
So you never saw her with any pills.
She never mentioned anything?

16:31.115 --> 16:33.241
No, of course not.

16:33.368 --> 16:36.828
Would it be all right
if I talk to a couple of her friends?

16:36.954 --> 16:39.206
- Her friends?
- I'm not gonna interrogate them.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.875
I just want to ask if Jessica
ever mentioned anything.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.669
It's pretty important. She's very sick.

16:43.795 --> 16:46.213
I understand. It's just, well...

16:47.423 --> 16:49.758
Jessica really
doesn't have any friends.

16:49.884 --> 16:51.218
- Not one?
- I've tried to help,

16:51.344 --> 16:54.221
make the kids include her more,
but, kids can be...

16:54.347 --> 16:56.390
- Kids?
- I was gonna say jerks.

16:57.934 --> 17:00.519
All the fifth-graders are assigned
an eighth-grade buddy.

17:00.645 --> 17:03.146
Maybe you could talk to hers.

17:08.236 --> 17:10.612
What's the status on House?

17:10.738 --> 17:12.906
He asked for time
to complete performance reviews

17:13.032 --> 17:14.574
for everyone in his department.

17:14.701 --> 17:19.746
- You told him no and gave him how long?
- A week. He'll do it.

17:20.081 --> 17:24.376
Guy's never done what he's told.
I don't see why he's gonna start now.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.629
Hi. Edward Vogler.

17:27.755 --> 17:31.049
Is Dr. House claiming that I'm forcing
him to get rid of one of you?

17:31.175 --> 17:34.052
I assume his goal is to stir up
antagonism toward me.

17:34.178 --> 17:37.556
- And your goal is?
- I am forcing him.

17:38.349 --> 17:41.727
I'll do whatever I can to ease
the transition for whoever he chooses.

17:41.853 --> 17:44.771
If you're feeling guilty about your
decision, there is an easy solution.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.773
I don't feel guilty.

17:46.899 --> 17:49.067
Then why approach me
and tell me all this?

17:49.193 --> 17:52.487
I don't feel guilty. That doesn't mean
I don't feel bad.

17:52.613 --> 17:55.615
I'm rich, but I'm still human.

17:55.825 --> 17:57.868
I just wanted you to know that

17:57.994 --> 18:01.246
if there's anything I can do for you,
my door is open.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.791
Thank you.

18:10.715 --> 18:12.716
You're looking for info?

18:12.842 --> 18:15.135
Thought you already had House
all figured out.

18:15.261 --> 18:18.221
I do.
Don't know his team, though.

18:20.850 --> 18:23.769
The ultrasound and biopsy
confirmed our worry.

18:23.895 --> 18:28.148
The tumor is extremely large,
at least 30 pounds.

18:28.274 --> 18:29.608
Oh, God.

18:29.734 --> 18:31.818
It's actually
a personal record for this clinic.

18:31.944 --> 18:36.031
But it's completely benign.
There's no sign of cancer at all.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.493
I've already spoken with Dr. Bergin,

18:39.619 --> 18:41.703
and he's available
first thing in the morning.

18:41.829 --> 18:43.330
For what?

18:44.624 --> 18:45.874
For the surgery.

18:46.000 --> 18:50.170
But if it's not cancer,
it can't kill me, right?

18:53.549 --> 18:56.468
- No.
- I'll have a huge scar.

18:56.594 --> 18:59.971
- I won't be able to wear a bikini.
- Do you wear a bikini now?

19:00.097 --> 19:03.433
- Yeah. You got a problem with that?
- Nope.

19:03.559 --> 19:05.101
But I've never gone swimming with you.

19:05.311 --> 19:07.646
I knew it.
That's what this is all about.

19:07.772 --> 19:10.774
You are trying to force me
to have cosmetic surgery.

19:10.900 --> 19:15.195
Yeah, that's exactly why I planted
a 30-pound tumor on your ovary.

19:15.363 --> 19:16.947
It's not gonna kill me.

19:17.073 --> 19:20.367
The only thing surgery is gonna do
is change the way I look.

19:20.493 --> 19:24.204
That is the definition
of cosmetic surgery.

19:24.330 --> 19:26.998
It would also relieve
your heartburn and discomfort.

19:27.124 --> 19:31.086
Yeah, right. Why give an antacid
if you can cut someone up

19:31.212 --> 19:34.047
and make them
a little easier on your eyes?

19:34.882 --> 19:38.635
My husband loves my body.

19:38.845 --> 19:42.180
He can't get enough of it. You think
he's gonna want to touch me

19:42.306 --> 19:45.976
if I look like I've been gutted
like a fish?

19:47.812 --> 19:51.022
That was unexpected.

19:51.649 --> 19:53.400
Yeah, it was.

19:55.152 --> 19:57.988
All she does during recess
is run laps around the playground.

19:58.114 --> 20:00.740
She says she's exercising, but
everyone knows it's just because

20:00.867 --> 20:02.242
no one wants to play with her.

20:02.368 --> 20:05.704
I mean, I am only her buddy
because Ms. Ayers assigned her to me.

20:05.830 --> 20:08.164
That does not mean I am her friend.

20:09.333 --> 20:12.043
I'll make sure her doctors
are all clear on that.

20:12.169 --> 20:13.712
Thanks.

20:14.005 --> 20:17.340
So, has she ever said anything
to you about diet pills?

20:17.508 --> 20:20.260
- She told you that, too?
- What do you mean?

20:20.511 --> 20:23.847
I busted her for taking drugs one day.
She totally lied,

20:23.973 --> 20:26.725
said that they were diet pills her mom
had given her. Come on. Get real.

20:26.851 --> 20:30.645
No way a girl like that
is taking diet pills.

20:30.771 --> 20:33.440
I didn't give her diet pills.
I would never do that.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.275
Right. So it was her imaginary mom.

20:35.401 --> 20:37.611
She didn't take any pills.
The girl was lying.

20:37.737 --> 20:38.820
Why would she lie?

20:38.946 --> 20:41.031
Because she's another mean little jerk.

20:41.157 --> 20:44.367
- Mom.
- I'm sorry, honey.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.037
Clemmie didn't lie.

20:49.957 --> 20:53.168
I did. I took the pills.

20:54.295 --> 20:58.006
I told her you gave them to me
because I didn't want to get in trouble.

20:58.132 --> 21:02.218
- Where did you get them?
- I took them from the store.

21:03.638 --> 21:08.308
- Why? Why would you do that?
- I didn't want to be ugly anymore.

21:08.559 --> 21:12.395
- Oh, baby. You're not ugly.
- Yes, I am.

21:12.897 --> 21:15.231
I know you don't think so,
but I am. I'm disgusting.

21:15.358 --> 21:18.318
Jessica, please don't say that.

21:18.903 --> 21:24.824
I just wanted to fit in.
You know, have friends.

21:25.368 --> 21:28.995
Or at least have one person
my age be nice to me.

21:35.127 --> 21:36.962
Listen, the...

21:37.129 --> 21:41.299
The pills cause blood clots,
heart attacks and insomnia.

21:41.509 --> 21:44.594
It explains everything. We'll keep
her overnight to make sure,

21:44.720 --> 21:46.930
but she'll be fine.

21:47.390 --> 21:48.890
Thank you.

21:51.560 --> 21:52.936
I can't believe
she was that desperate.

21:53.104 --> 21:55.772
Yeah, I'm sure
that if everyone I knew hated me

21:55.898 --> 21:59.275
and couldn't bear to look at me,
I wouldn't go so far as to shoplift.

21:59.402 --> 22:01.027
I'm not talking about the shoplifting.

22:01.153 --> 22:03.363
I'm sure she didn't even know
they were dangerous.

22:03.489 --> 22:06.408
She probably saw them advertised
on TV or over the Internet.

22:06.534 --> 22:10.370
Right. So I guess it's the media
and pharmaceutical companies' fault now,

22:10.496 --> 22:13.498
not the fact that she can't stop
shoveling food down her throat.

22:13.624 --> 22:15.041
No one forced her to get fat.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.918
No one forced a cancer patient
to get cancer.

22:17.044 --> 22:19.629
- It's not a disease.
- Have you seen the latest research?

22:19.755 --> 22:21.256
Yes, I have.

22:21.382 --> 22:25.343
What I haven't seen lately is a kid
eating an apple or riding a bike.

22:25.469 --> 22:26.761
You Americans can't even compete with

22:26.887 --> 22:28.596
the rest of the world
in basketball anymore,

22:28.723 --> 22:30.849
unless, of course,
it's the type you play

22:30.975 --> 22:34.185
with a remote control
on a big-screen TV.

22:34.311 --> 22:35.562
Right.

22:35.688 --> 22:38.565
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Are you gonna let him say that?

22:38.691 --> 22:41.026
He insulted our basketball teams.

22:52.496 --> 22:54.205
Oh, my God.

22:54.790 --> 22:57.751
- It hurts so bad. Please.
- What happened?

22:57.877 --> 22:59.836
- She's bleeding.
- From where?

22:59.962 --> 23:03.048
Oh, my gosh.

23:03.257 --> 23:06.009
Just please stop it. Please. God.

23:13.684 --> 23:15.602
Diet pills don't cause skin necrosis.

23:15.728 --> 23:17.520
Could be something
related to the pills.

23:17.646 --> 23:20.398
- Or not.
- Or both.

23:20.649 --> 23:24.152
Diet pills brought her to us.
We gave her the sores.

23:24.361 --> 23:26.529
You think she got a staph infection
from something here?

23:26.655 --> 23:28.364
I'm not saying the hospital
gave her the sores.

23:28.491 --> 23:32.744
We did, by treating her.
Warfarin-induced skin necrosis.

23:32.912 --> 23:36.164
Highly unlikely. We started her
on heparin before the warfarin.

23:36.290 --> 23:39.501
- Who gave her the heparin?
- I did warfarin. She did heparin.

23:39.627 --> 23:41.086
Sure you didn't both give her warfarin?

23:41.212 --> 23:43.880
Yes. I did not screw up.

23:44.340 --> 23:48.343
Did you actually see her prepare
and administer the heparin?

23:53.432 --> 23:56.392
- Enough said.
- You were standing right there.

23:56.894 --> 23:59.646
- I was preparing my own dose.
- Yeah, right.

23:59.980 --> 24:02.982
- There's gotta be some other cause.
- None that I can think of.

24:03.109 --> 24:06.194
Let's fix the mistake. Give her
unfractionated IV heparin

24:06.320 --> 24:10.365
and low-molecular-weight heparin
by subcutaneous injection, stat.

24:15.246 --> 24:17.247
Making me look bad
is not gonna save your job.

24:17.373 --> 24:19.374
You think you're incapable
of making a mistake?

24:19.583 --> 24:22.252
You think that I am that weak that
I'm gonna just roll over and take this?

24:22.378 --> 24:25.255
House isn't gonna protect you
just because you kiss his ass.

24:25.381 --> 24:27.173
Vogler wants to know
what he can do for me.

24:27.466 --> 24:32.512
Stop worrying about your asses
and start worrying about the patient's.

24:51.782 --> 24:53.324
She sleeping?

24:53.450 --> 24:55.618
As a result of the sedatives, yeah.

24:55.744 --> 24:58.454
We can't let her wake up.
Too much pain.

25:00.499 --> 25:05.587
Warfarin-induced skin necrosis.

25:06.130 --> 25:08.631
I have no idea what that means.

25:09.049 --> 25:12.677
But it says here we
gave her the warfarin.

25:12.887 --> 25:15.471
And I do know
what induced means.

25:15.973 --> 25:17.515
We did this?

25:18.225 --> 25:21.769
At this point, it's not exactly clear.

25:22.271 --> 25:24.355
You should probably talk
to Dr. House.

25:24.481 --> 25:27.942
Oh. You two need time
to get your story straight.

25:28.068 --> 25:29.611
He doesn't tell me what to do.

25:29.737 --> 25:34.115
So you don't just blindly follow
his commands. You're your own man.

25:34.533 --> 25:38.244
And yet here you are,
working for a guy you can't stand.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.788
- I respect him.
- What exactly is it you respect?

25:40.915 --> 25:45.126
His attitude toward humanity?
He thinks we're all idiots and liars.

25:45.252 --> 25:46.961
How about his attitude toward you?

25:47.087 --> 25:48.922
Plays with you like a cat
with a ball of string.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.006
What do you want?

25:50.132 --> 25:51.966
I want to know if you
want to keep your job.

25:52.218 --> 25:54.344
If he chooses to let me go,
I can live with that.

25:54.470 --> 25:56.971
- That's not an answer.
- Are you offering to protect me?

25:57.097 --> 25:59.682
- Still not an answer.
- I want my job.

26:05.481 --> 26:06.898
Dr. Chase.

26:07.024 --> 26:08.316
Boss.

26:12.029 --> 26:13.655
What was that about?

26:13.781 --> 26:16.991
He wanted to know what warfarin is.
I don't know.

26:43.310 --> 26:45.019
Icy.

26:46.647 --> 26:50.316
I'll definitely think twice before
correcting one of your mistakes again.

26:50.442 --> 26:51.567
Correct all you want.

26:51.777 --> 26:54.445
Of course, it's a bit more productive
if there's an actual mistake.

26:54.571 --> 26:57.448
Right. I always forget that part.

26:57.992 --> 26:59.075
I gave her the heparin,

26:59.201 --> 27:01.828
which means the necrosis
is not a reaction to the warfarin,

27:01.954 --> 27:05.039
which is probably why
she's not responding to your treatment.

27:05.249 --> 27:06.457
Yet.

27:10.254 --> 27:13.131
If you didn't screw up,
then what is it?

27:14.842 --> 27:17.302
- You don't have an answer.
- Yet.

27:18.095 --> 27:19.929
When you come up with something,
let me know.

27:20.055 --> 27:23.683
I'll be in the clinic, warming up.

27:24.310 --> 27:27.020
I'm the only one who's always stood
behind you when you've screwed up.

27:27.146 --> 27:30.231
Why? Why would you support
someone who screws up?

27:30.399 --> 27:32.025
Because I'm not insanely insecure,

27:32.151 --> 27:34.193
and because I can actually trust
in another human being,

27:34.320 --> 27:36.654
and I am not an angry,
misanthropic son of a bitch.

27:36.780 --> 27:39.449
I'm sorry.
You said you weren't angry.

27:42.202 --> 27:44.120
Who would you fire?

27:47.041 --> 27:49.751
- No one.
- Not an option.

27:50.294 --> 27:52.420
If everyone took a pay cut
and put in a few more hours,

27:52.546 --> 27:54.380
we could all stay
for the same amount of money.

27:54.506 --> 27:58.009
Figures you'd try and come up
with a solution where no one gets hurt.

27:58.135 --> 28:02.055
The problem is, the world doesn't work
that way just 'cause you want it to.

28:02.181 --> 28:04.766
Figures you'd stall
and refuse to deal with the issue.

28:04.892 --> 28:09.187
Problem is, the world doesn't
go away just because you want it to.

28:25.621 --> 28:27.663
Excuse me. Dr. House?

28:27.998 --> 28:30.750
My wife saw you yesterday.
Lucille Hernandez?

28:30.876 --> 28:35.338
- He's not in today.
- My wife said he walked with a cane.

28:35.589 --> 28:40.426
He's also got a bit of a drug problem,
sometimes doesn't show up for weeks.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.930
The MRIs are rented, but...

28:45.099 --> 28:48.601
- Did you make a decision?
- He's not gonna fire anybody.

28:49.186 --> 28:52.146
I'm gonna cut
the pay of all four of us.

28:52.272 --> 28:54.107
Seventeen percent across the board

28:54.233 --> 28:56.776
will allow you to keep us all
for the same amount of money.

28:56.902 --> 28:59.779
I believe it's what
you suits call win-win.

29:00.656 --> 29:03.074
- All right, if you...
- No.

29:03.325 --> 29:06.619
If he can work it so we keep the current
staff for the same amount of money,

29:06.745 --> 29:09.163
what difference does it make?

29:12.209 --> 29:14.252
It's not about the money.

29:14.378 --> 29:17.255
This is not a negotiation.
It never was.

29:18.590 --> 29:21.092
I need to know that whatever
I ask you to do,

29:21.218 --> 29:23.761
however distasteful
you find it, you'll do it.

29:23.887 --> 29:26.889
And just as importantly,
you need to know that.

29:38.652 --> 29:40.903
What's going on with my wife?

29:41.113 --> 29:44.740
Even if I was Dr. House,
physician-patient confidentiality

29:44.867 --> 29:46.868
protects me
from annoying conversations.

29:46.994 --> 29:48.369
She told me about the tumor.

29:48.495 --> 29:51.456
Yeah? She also tell you
why she's refusing to have it removed?

29:51.582 --> 29:55.543
I don't care about a scar. And
she can always gain the weight back.

29:55.711 --> 29:58.045
You want her to regain the weight?

29:58.172 --> 30:01.215
Yeah. I mean, only if she wants to.

30:01.383 --> 30:03.092
Why?

30:03.635 --> 30:06.387
I've always thought she looked
sexiest when she was pregnant.

30:06.513 --> 30:08.598
Something about knowing
she's a mother just makes me want...

30:08.724 --> 30:12.935
- Tell her that and leave me alone.
- I did. You gotta talk to her.

30:13.061 --> 30:14.604
I couldn't bear it
if something happened to her.

30:14.730 --> 30:18.649
The tumor is benign. Nothing's gonna
happen, except maybe some heartburn.

30:19.693 --> 30:21.986
What if it gets even bigger,
or it changes?

30:22.112 --> 30:25.698
You know where to find us.
Building's not going anywhere.

30:25.824 --> 30:29.744
Tell her it's cancer. You obviously
don't have a problem with lying.

30:29.870 --> 30:33.414
- Oh. Way to win me over.
- We've got six kids.

30:33.540 --> 30:35.208
She can't afford to take a chance.

30:35.334 --> 30:37.752
You have kids. How novel.
That changes everything.

30:37.878 --> 30:41.130
So if Mommy gets heartburn,
one of them might catch on fire.

30:41.256 --> 30:44.342
Please. I don't know what we'd do.

30:50.599 --> 30:52.517
They are cute.

30:53.060 --> 30:55.811
- Have her come back in.
- What?

30:55.938 --> 30:59.482
Your plight has moved me.
Tell your wife to come back.

31:05.447 --> 31:06.864
The necrosis is getting worse.

31:06.990 --> 31:09.992
Maybe because we're treating her
for the wrong thing.

31:11.119 --> 31:13.454
Have you found the right thing?

31:13.580 --> 31:14.622
No.

31:14.748 --> 31:16.624
Then we continue the treatment,

31:16.750 --> 31:18.501
hope it's just taking
longer than it should.

31:18.627 --> 31:20.962
At this point, it doesn't matter
what caused the necrosis.

31:21.088 --> 31:22.255
Or who.

31:22.381 --> 31:25.132
If we don't stop it from spreading, it
will kill her before the end of the day.

31:25.259 --> 31:26.801
- What else can we do?
- Get rid of it.

31:26.927 --> 31:30.805
Remove the dying flesh before
it penetrates the abdominal wall.

31:32.349 --> 31:33.224
Do it.

31:34.184 --> 31:37.395
There's still a chance the heparin
treatment could start to take effect.

31:37.563 --> 31:39.522
We're gonna wait as long as we can,

31:39.648 --> 31:42.108
but if there's no change
in the next few hours,

31:42.317 --> 31:44.068
we're gonna have to treat
the symptoms directly.

31:44.194 --> 31:47.655
- So you can get rid of the sores?
- Through surgery.

31:48.031 --> 31:50.533
Technically, it's an amputation.

31:50.784 --> 31:53.119
Amputation? But the sores are...

31:53.245 --> 31:58.082
Warfarin-induced necrosis attacks
fatty tissue, mainly in the breasts.

31:59.042 --> 32:03.754
Wait. Are you talking
about cutting off my daughter's breasts?

32:08.510 --> 32:10.177
She's 10 years old.

32:10.304 --> 32:14.223
A radical mastectomy may be
her only chance for survival.

32:15.684 --> 32:19.312
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have
to ask you to sign this.

32:35.996 --> 32:38.456
Could we talk?

32:39.458 --> 32:42.460
What, no roses, no chocolates?

32:42.794 --> 32:46.422
- If you're here to apologize...
- I'm not here to apologize.

32:46.673 --> 32:48.299
Uh-oh.

32:49.009 --> 32:51.969
That means you're here
for something more complicated.

32:53.347 --> 32:56.098
Do you want to fire me?

32:56.516 --> 33:01.187
Yes. Just waiting for an excuse.
Thank God Vogler came along.

33:01.480 --> 33:02.688
It's the only reason I can think of

33:02.814 --> 33:04.732
why you're insisting
that I made a mistake.

33:04.858 --> 33:08.444
Really? Because there is
another explanation.

33:08.654 --> 33:11.822
Perhaps not as much fun
as your Freudian analysis,

33:12.199 --> 33:13.616
but maybe you actually made a mistake.

33:13.742 --> 33:17.870
You're doing this because you can't deal
with your feelings for me.

33:22.209 --> 33:26.003
I believe that you were the only one
to express feelings.

33:26.505 --> 33:28.964
If we're gonna look at this
from a first-year psych point of view,

33:29.091 --> 33:32.259
maybe you want me to fire you.
Maybe that's why you're acting weird.

33:32.386 --> 33:33.761
You're the one being different.

33:33.887 --> 33:36.013
You're always pushing things,
pushing the rules, pushing us.

33:36.139 --> 33:38.599
But not this time. You jumped
on this idea like a life raft.

33:38.725 --> 33:40.434
Not one question
about what else it could be.

33:40.560 --> 33:42.311
No riding us for other answers.

33:42.437 --> 33:44.522
I have the answer.

33:45.524 --> 33:48.901
Then why aren't you watching TV
or playing your damn Game Boy,

33:49.027 --> 33:52.446
or whatever else you have
so much fun doing by yourself?

33:56.493 --> 34:00.538
Maybe I should just quit.
Make it easy for everyone.

34:03.125 --> 34:04.834
Maybe you should.

34:10.507 --> 34:14.385
- Men are pigs.
- You called me in to tell me...

34:14.511 --> 34:17.722
I should've realized
the vasectomy and condoms was overkill,

34:17.848 --> 34:19.515
but this was too obvious to miss.

34:21.351 --> 34:23.936
Cute kids.

34:24.146 --> 34:27.940
Love her green eyes
and his baby blues.

34:28.108 --> 34:30.651
Of course, since both you
and your husband have brown eyes...

34:30.777 --> 34:31.986
Where'd you get that?

34:32.112 --> 34:37.116
From the father of three,
maximum four, of your six children.

34:37.451 --> 34:39.618
I'm thinking maybe the reason
you don't want surgery

34:39.745 --> 34:42.246
is that while your husband will find
you attractive no matter what,

34:42.372 --> 34:46.876
all the other men you're sleeping
with might not be so open-minded.

34:47.002 --> 34:50.963
Which brings me back
to my original thesis, men are pigs.

34:51.256 --> 34:53.716
You got nothing to worry about.

34:54.009 --> 34:56.177
They'll pretty much
have sex with anyone,

34:56.303 --> 35:01.223
fat, skinny, married, single,
complete strangers, relatives.

35:01.391 --> 35:03.726
You are sick.

35:03.935 --> 35:05.519
So are you.

35:05.645 --> 35:08.105
And I'm sure there are
web sites full of men

35:08.231 --> 35:11.567
looking for married women
with surgical scars.

35:12.861 --> 35:16.197
So have the surgery. Please?

35:18.742 --> 35:20.117
Okay.

35:25.123 --> 35:26.499
Thanks.

35:30.962 --> 35:32.546
Why have you been talking to Cameron?

35:32.672 --> 35:36.300
If House picks you, I'll be needing
a new source in that room.

35:36.426 --> 35:38.177
If he picks me?

35:38.303 --> 35:42.473
Sure. Foreman's smarter.
House has got a thing for Cameron.

35:42.599 --> 35:45.142
I've been feeding you information
so you'll protect me.

35:45.268 --> 35:47.436
And I will protect you,
as long as I need you.

35:47.562 --> 35:50.481
And you will feed me information
as long as you need me.

35:50.607 --> 35:54.610
I spoke with Cameron
because if I have alternatives,

35:54.736 --> 35:56.570
I don't need you.

35:59.324 --> 36:01.951
She's not gonna rat on House.

36:02.160 --> 36:05.704
Foreman never said anything
about talking to me?

36:07.666 --> 36:09.542
Interesting, huh?

36:28.478 --> 36:33.190
It's been almost three hours.
Still no change in her condition.

36:33.400 --> 36:36.861
I think we should
get her into surgery.

36:37.237 --> 36:39.321
So what do you want to do?

36:40.949 --> 36:44.285
Assume that Cameron didn't screw up.

36:46.204 --> 36:47.621
What if it's not the warfarin?

36:47.747 --> 36:50.124
It has to be. The sores presented
right after we administered it.

36:50.250 --> 36:53.335
Right, right, right.
But let's just say it's not.

36:53.545 --> 36:54.670
Come on. What do you got?

36:54.796 --> 36:56.505
- Can I have a second to think?
- There's no time to think.

36:56.631 --> 36:58.799
Just say the first thing
that comes into your head.

36:58.925 --> 37:00.426
- She's fat.
- Enough already.

37:00.552 --> 37:03.095
- We got it. You hate fat people.
- That's not what I meant.

37:03.221 --> 37:05.180
We already considered
obesity as a cause.

37:05.307 --> 37:08.100
- So did all her other doctors.
- I mean, what if it's not a cause?

37:08.226 --> 37:10.144
What if it's a symptom?

37:10.270 --> 37:15.649
So, what could cause obesity
and skin necrosis?

37:18.028 --> 37:20.446
I don't care if it makes sense.
Just give me something.

37:20.572 --> 37:24.074
- Ulcers secondary to vasculitis.
- No, that's just sores, not obesity.

37:24.200 --> 37:26.744
- Pyoderma gangrenosum.
- More sores.

37:27.162 --> 37:30.372
Let's look at it from the other side.
What has obesity as a symptom?

37:30.498 --> 37:33.500
- Hypothyroidism?
- Genetics are more likely.

37:33.627 --> 37:35.377
Her mom's heavy, too.

37:39.174 --> 37:42.426
She's not just heavy, she's tall.

37:44.387 --> 37:47.139
- We have any history on the dad?
- Yeah.

37:49.684 --> 37:51.894
6'1".

37:54.606 --> 37:56.398
Kid's short.

37:56.524 --> 38:01.195
We got stunted growth, high
blood pressure, blood clots, obesity.

38:02.530 --> 38:05.658
- It's Cushing's.
- No. Necrosis doesn't present...

38:05.784 --> 38:08.535
In rare cases,
Cushing's can cause hypercalcemia,

38:08.662 --> 38:11.330
which can lead to the same
skin necrosis as warfarin.

38:11.456 --> 38:14.708
- It's perfect. It explains everything.
- Except it's not Cushing's.

38:14.834 --> 38:18.170
She's had multiple blood tests, and
none show abnormal cortisol levels.

38:18.296 --> 38:21.465
The hypercortisolism could be cyclical.
We didn't catch it in the right phase.

38:21.591 --> 38:24.426
- We'll have to do another UFC.
- There's no time.

38:24.552 --> 38:26.178
We've got less than
an hour to make a call.

38:26.304 --> 38:28.472
If we treat for Cushing's
and we're wrong, she's dead.

38:28.598 --> 38:32.643
If we assume it's not Cushing's, she'll
lose her breasts and may still be sick.

38:35.480 --> 38:36.563
Do an MRI.

38:36.690 --> 38:38.816
You want us to look
for hypercortisolism with an MRI?

38:38.942 --> 38:43.278
I want you to look for what could cause
hypercortisolism with an MRI.

39:03.800 --> 39:05.509
Nothing on the adrenals.

39:08.221 --> 39:12.975
- Heard Cameron went home. Is she sick?
- Go back to the pituitary views.

39:13.101 --> 39:14.268
She seemed okay.

39:14.394 --> 39:16.145
Think she's got
another reason for leaving?

39:16.271 --> 39:21.066
I hope so. Wait, stop.
There. What's that?

39:25.488 --> 39:27.656
A tumor.

39:28.408 --> 39:30.075
It's Cushing's.

39:30.326 --> 39:32.411
The tumor causes Cushing's.

39:32.537 --> 39:35.205
And Cushing's messes
with hormone production.

39:35.331 --> 39:37.666
Hormones control everything,
growth, weight.

39:37.792 --> 39:39.585
Can you fix it?

39:39.753 --> 39:41.712
She'll need surgery
to remove the tumor.

39:42.047 --> 39:45.090
Once it's gone, everything
will get normal very fast.

39:45.216 --> 39:47.426
- No mastectomy?
- No.

39:48.553 --> 39:50.929
- Thank God.
- The surgery is dangerous.

39:51.056 --> 39:53.640
The pituitary's located
between the cavernous sinuses,

39:53.767 --> 39:55.309
basically right between the eyes.

39:55.435 --> 39:57.895
The area contains the nerves
that control eye movement

39:58.021 --> 39:59.688
and the major arteries
that feed the brain.

39:59.814 --> 40:00.814
Oh, my God.

40:00.940 --> 40:04.943
The surgeon will approach
the gland transsphenoidally.

40:05.153 --> 40:07.029
An incision will be made under the lip,

40:07.155 --> 40:09.823
through which he'll insert
a fiber-optic microscope.

40:09.949 --> 40:12.367
Once the tumor's found,
he'll cut it into small pieces

40:12.494 --> 40:14.703
and remove it through
the same hole under the lip.

40:14.829 --> 40:16.789
The whole procedure
should take about three hours,

40:16.915 --> 40:19.083
and your daughter should be able
to go home in a few days.

40:19.209 --> 40:23.253
The sores will go away, as well
as her fatigue and the muscle pain.

40:23.505 --> 40:26.298
She'll even start losing weight.

41:15.223 --> 41:17.266
- Jessica.
- Hi.

41:17.392 --> 41:20.060
- Is that really you?
- Yep, it's me.

41:20.186 --> 41:23.063
You look fantastic.

41:24.357 --> 41:27.192
She always looked fantastic.

41:27.360 --> 41:29.153
Yeah.

41:55.680 --> 41:58.640
- It's been a week.
- Actually, it's over a week.

41:58.850 --> 42:01.018
How have you guys been?

42:01.978 --> 42:03.896
Who is it?

42:08.318 --> 42:09.860
Chase.

42:09.986 --> 42:11.612
No, Chase stays.

42:13.823 --> 42:16.491
- Pick someone else.
- The deal was...

42:16.618 --> 42:18.869
The deal's changed.

42:19.204 --> 42:21.288
Pick someone else.

42:21.956 --> 42:23.207
No.

42:32.800 --> 42:36.595
Pick someone else, or it'll be
the whole department.
