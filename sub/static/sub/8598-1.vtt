01:00.552 --> 01:05.992
In ignem iacto unguenta

01:06.793 --> 01:08.357
pretiosa,

01:08.518 --> 01:10.862
et mira sumio.

01:37.005 --> 01:39.758
Tibi supplex...

01:39.925 --> 01:42.553
donem honorem!

01:42.803 --> 01:45.306
No!

01:45.472 --> 01:49.898
You promised! You promised not our child!

01:53.772 --> 01:57.697
Whore! He is the one.

01:59.569 --> 02:02.448
You can't hurt him now, you bastard!

02:05.867 --> 02:08.211
His blood will flow.

02:09.329 --> 02:11.252
Come.

02:13.291 --> 02:15.214
Come.

02:17.337 --> 02:18.805
Come.

02:38.024 --> 02:40.948
Take him away! Forever!

02:42.445 --> 02:44.368
Do it now.

03:12.267 --> 03:15.396
You will take his place.

03:29.300 --> 03:33.171
Don't be afraid, little one.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.923
You'll be safe.

03:44.090 --> 03:45.888
Lucifer!

03:46.092 --> 03:48.060
Rubrum e iugulo

03:48.261 --> 03:55.611
ut tibi supplex donem honorem.

06:05.398 --> 06:10.325
The child had been saved, so it seemed.

06:10.528 --> 06:12.997
And I vowed that he would never know

06:13.198 --> 06:15.621
the evil from whence he was spawned.

06:15.784 --> 06:19.914
And when his father
finally died a horrible death,

06:20.121 --> 06:24.422
I felt sure that the curse
had passed forever.

06:25.919 --> 06:28.513
I can't believe you inherited this place.

06:28.671 --> 06:31.220
I know. Me neither.

06:31.424 --> 06:34.303
I suppose we'll just have to
get used to the good life.

06:36.096 --> 06:38.394
Does that mean we get to
hire a maid and a cook?

06:38.556 --> 06:40.058
Are you kidding?

06:40.266 --> 06:42.360
It's gonna break me
just to keep the lawn mowed.

06:42.519 --> 06:47.116
Well, we could always sell it
and move to Westwood.

06:47.315 --> 06:48.942
Very funny. Very funny.

06:49.150 --> 06:52.324
No, I like this place... I think.

06:52.529 --> 06:54.623
What's that?

06:54.781 --> 06:59.412
- I don't know. It looks...
- Like a grave.

07:00.370 --> 07:03.465
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna take a look.

07:03.665 --> 07:05.884
No, don't. It's kinda creepy-looking.

07:06.042 --> 07:08.966
Come on, Becky. It's mine, isn't it?

07:14.759 --> 07:17.603
I don't know. Looks sort of old.

07:17.804 --> 07:20.182
Must have been hard growing up
without a family.

07:20.390 --> 07:21.858
I mean...

07:27.480 --> 07:29.448
Rebecca, this is Wolfgang.

07:29.649 --> 07:32.528
He's sort of the caretaker around here.

07:32.694 --> 07:35.197
Wolfgang, this is Rebecca.

07:38.074 --> 07:39.951
Hi. I...

07:41.786 --> 07:43.754
You scared me.

07:47.333 --> 07:50.507
Well, we'll go back to the house.

07:50.712 --> 07:53.181
We'll see you later, Wolfgang.

07:57.218 --> 08:00.222
So Wolfgang's the only family
I've ever known.

08:00.388 --> 08:03.312
Who read all these books? Your dad?

08:03.516 --> 08:06.019
Yeah, I guess so.

08:10.231 --> 08:12.359
The Secret World of Magic?

08:15.445 --> 08:18.244
The Black Magic Ritual.

08:18.448 --> 08:22.999
The Grimoire of Abra-Melin.

08:33.212 --> 08:35.135
You all right?

08:36.591 --> 08:39.344
You probably scared him
more than he scared you.

08:40.385 --> 08:41.888
Hey, I'll tell you what.

08:42.138 --> 08:44.853
Why don't you start cleaning the upstairs
and I'll work on the downstairs?

08:45.058 --> 08:46.480
What do you say?

08:47.644 --> 08:53.777
OK. But if there are
any more rats the deal's off.

11:28.429 --> 11:30.978
I've been thinking.

11:37.563 --> 11:40.112
About having a party.

11:44.320 --> 11:46.493
- Here?
- Sure. Why not?

11:46.656 --> 11:49.000
It's not like anybody could
wreck the place or anything.

11:58.042 --> 11:59.965
Whoa!

12:01.254 --> 12:04.383
This is it! Eddie, Eddie.

12:05.133 --> 12:06.976
They got food.

12:08.845 --> 12:12.145
Eddie, these are my friends.
They love me, man.

12:12.306 --> 12:15.776
- And this is where they're at.
- That's good. That's real good.

12:15.977 --> 12:17.775
But what if they're not?

12:18.855 --> 12:21.324
Then I'll have to get some new friends.

12:39.417 --> 12:42.466
Man, you should have seen
the quim I poked last night.

12:42.628 --> 12:45.097
I'm so unhappy.

12:46.048 --> 12:51.555
Toad Boy needs sweetmeat for his tum.

12:51.721 --> 12:54.315
Will you knock off
that Toad Boy shit already?

12:54.515 --> 12:55.767
Jesus!

12:55.975 --> 13:01.106
You don't love me. You just pretend.

13:01.314 --> 13:02.907
Shit, I can't talk to you, man.

13:03.107 --> 13:05.030
- Hey, Dick.
- Jon.

13:05.234 --> 13:06.861
- How you doing?
- I'm doing alright.

13:07.069 --> 13:09.322
It's him I'm worried about.

13:11.449 --> 13:16.421
- Hey, Mark. How you doing?
- I'm miserable.

13:27.423 --> 13:30.518
So, wanna dance later?

13:31.385 --> 13:33.387
Think you can handle it?

13:35.223 --> 13:37.692
- Try me.
- I might.

13:47.401 --> 13:49.495
I went out with Mark last night.

13:50.821 --> 13:52.494
You're kidding.

13:53.574 --> 13:56.874
- You mean Toad Boy?
- Don't ask me why.

13:57.078 --> 13:59.126
No, things were really nice, they were,

13:59.330 --> 14:02.675
but then he just got so weird.

14:03.918 --> 14:06.046
Do you think he's a virgin?

14:06.212 --> 14:08.135
I don't know.

14:10.341 --> 14:13.345
But I certainly know who isn't.

14:14.345 --> 14:15.813
Hey, Rebecca.

14:16.013 --> 14:18.482
Can you lead me to the nearest beer?

14:19.225 --> 14:21.068
In the refrigerator.

14:30.528 --> 14:32.405
Thanks.

14:33.990 --> 14:38.245
So... Who's your beautiful friend?

14:38.452 --> 14:41.422
- I'm Donna.
- They call me Dick.

14:41.622 --> 14:45.047
But you can call me... Dick.

14:48.004 --> 14:49.722
Break dance!

15:45.853 --> 15:47.776
I think I busted my head.

15:47.938 --> 15:49.690
Oh, thank God.

15:49.899 --> 15:52.197
I thought that you really hurt yourself.

15:56.113 --> 15:57.456
What do you guys wanna do?

15:57.657 --> 15:59.159
We could play hide-and-go-seek.

15:59.325 --> 16:00.872
Yeah!

16:01.035 --> 16:03.629
What about Trivial Pursuit?

16:03.788 --> 16:07.008
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

16:07.208 --> 16:09.631
Why don't we just play charades?

16:09.794 --> 16:11.717
Yeah.

16:14.256 --> 16:16.930
- Strip poker.
- Yeah.

16:17.134 --> 16:19.011
No way.

16:19.220 --> 16:21.097
All right!

16:32.149 --> 16:36.199
I got an idea. Let's do a ritual.

16:41.992 --> 16:44.916
You guys, it's kinda spooky in here.

16:45.746 --> 16:47.589
Alright, everybody listen up.

16:47.790 --> 16:50.919
I want everybody to take a sip. Go ahead.

16:51.585 --> 16:56.512
I'm gonna draw a circle and I
want you all to stay inside it.

17:07.518 --> 17:09.441
Go on, man.

17:21.323 --> 17:24.041
So now what are you doin'?

17:24.201 --> 17:26.750
I'm gonna conjure up a spirit,

17:26.954 --> 17:31.801
and it's gonna appear
right here in this triangle.

17:32.793 --> 17:35.137
Yeah. OK.

17:36.547 --> 17:38.424
I believe you.

17:40.801 --> 17:43.395
Jonathan, how do you know how to do that?

17:43.554 --> 17:47.479
I don't know.
I must have read it in a book.

17:50.686 --> 17:55.778
Rebecca, take the rock and put it
at the north point of the circle.

17:55.941 --> 17:57.318
Where?

17:57.526 --> 18:01.156
Take the candle
and put it at the south point.

18:02.922 --> 18:04.845
Right there.

18:15.377 --> 18:17.175
Yod hay vau hay.

18:20.841 --> 18:22.718
Yod hay vau hay.

18:25.471 --> 18:29.192
Yod hay vau hay.

18:34.438 --> 18:36.156
Yod hay vau hay.

18:36.440 --> 18:38.488
You do the hokey-pokey
and you turn yourself around.

18:38.692 --> 18:40.694
Hey, knock it off!

18:50.913 --> 18:53.712
Ateh malkuth...

18:54.959 --> 18:57.883
ve-gedulah ve-geburah...

18:58.420 --> 19:01.549
le-olahm. Amen.

19:01.924 --> 19:06.145
Te nunc transforma in formam veram

19:06.345 --> 19:11.067
quod eludet species mentem meam.

19:12.560 --> 19:14.904
Shut up, goddammit!

19:15.062 --> 19:18.657
I'm sorry. Jeez.

19:26.949 --> 19:31.830
O Surgat, I conjure thee...

19:32.037 --> 19:35.462
that thou come
before this circle immediately

19:35.624 --> 19:38.798
and agree to obey my orders.

19:40.212 --> 19:45.719
Come, I order thee in the name
of the most Holy Trinity.

19:45.885 --> 19:48.513
I order thee to manifest thyself at once,

19:48.721 --> 19:51.315
without injury to me
or any other in this room.

19:53.225 --> 19:56.525
Come, I order thee.

20:03.152 --> 20:05.951
Come, I order thee,

20:06.155 --> 20:08.999
in the name of the most Holy Trinity.

20:11.535 --> 20:14.163
Come, I order thee.

20:29.637 --> 20:31.981
Well, that was fun.

20:32.848 --> 20:34.566
Yeah, let's go get another beer.

20:34.767 --> 20:36.644
Nice try, Jon.

20:36.852 --> 20:40.447
- Where's Robin?
- I don't know.

20:40.648 --> 20:42.321
Maybe the toad monster got her.

20:42.524 --> 20:44.197
I don't think that's very funny.

20:44.818 --> 20:47.697
Well, she's not the kind
who would just leave.

20:48.739 --> 20:51.242
Honey, I think we'd better go find her.

20:51.408 --> 20:53.035
Yeah, come on.

20:53.243 --> 20:55.337
No, no, wait.
I need to dismiss the spirit.

20:55.496 --> 20:57.874
So do I. Where's the bathroom?

20:58.040 --> 21:00.384
Upstairs.

21:00.542 --> 21:02.465
Come on.

21:49.633 --> 21:51.931
- Robin?
- Hey, Robin!

21:55.055 --> 21:56.978
Jeez!

22:10.779 --> 22:12.076
Dude.

22:13.657 --> 22:15.375
- Dude.
- What?

22:15.576 --> 22:17.169
I don't think she's in here.

22:18.495 --> 22:20.338
Well, I don't think so either.

22:23.500 --> 22:25.093
Hey, let's...

22:25.294 --> 22:27.592
- Check out the closet.
- Check out the closet.

22:39.767 --> 22:41.690
You bozo!

22:50.527 --> 22:53.201
- Hey, Mike. Mike.
- What?

22:53.363 --> 22:55.912
Wasn't he over there?

23:02.456 --> 23:05.380
I don't think she's here.

23:16.261 --> 23:19.140
Robin! Hey, Robin. Where are you?

23:19.348 --> 23:21.726
Hey, Robin.

23:23.060 --> 23:25.358
Robin! Hey, come on.

23:29.566 --> 23:31.193
There she is.

23:35.823 --> 23:38.076
Hey, Robin, what are you doing?

23:38.283 --> 23:39.626
Robin.

23:39.785 --> 23:41.378
Robin?

23:41.537 --> 23:45.258
- You OK?
- Yeah, I guess so.

23:46.458 --> 23:47.630
Come on, little girl.

23:47.835 --> 23:50.054
I'll have you feelin' better in no time.

23:56.927 --> 24:00.557
- I made a big decision today.
- What?

24:00.722 --> 24:05.319
Well... I decided to withdraw
from school this quarter.

24:07.563 --> 24:10.942
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

24:11.525 --> 24:16.076
Listen, I just think
I should take some time off.

24:16.280 --> 24:18.248
Stay home and fix this place up.

24:19.158 --> 24:21.286
Look, I walked around
this place all day today.

24:21.493 --> 24:23.336
I thought of all these
great things I could do.

24:23.537 --> 24:27.374
Terrific, but can't you just wait until
you've graduated to fix up the house?

24:27.583 --> 24:30.587
No, I can't wait.
I got this urge to do it now.

24:32.004 --> 24:36.259
Look, when I inherited this house,

24:36.466 --> 24:38.389
I inherited a lot of responsibility.

24:39.469 --> 24:41.221
I'm just trying to do things right.

24:41.889 --> 24:44.733
I want this to be a nice home
for both of us.

24:45.475 --> 24:47.352
This place is gonna need work and

24:47.561 --> 24:50.235
I can't do it if I'm going
to school full time.

24:50.439 --> 24:52.567
You understand?

24:55.319 --> 24:57.287
Yeah, I understand.

25:00.949 --> 25:02.951
I just want good things for you.

25:05.412 --> 25:07.335
I know.

26:18.068 --> 26:20.162
And so it had begun.

26:20.320 --> 26:22.743
The evil one willing the boy on,

26:22.906 --> 26:26.752
using the boy's curiosity
as a powerful weapon.

26:26.910 --> 26:29.163
I could but sit and wait,

26:29.371 --> 26:33.421
gripped by the fear of
events foreshadowed.

28:46.049 --> 28:49.303
- Hey, kiddo.
- Hi. How did it go today?

28:49.511 --> 28:51.388
See for yourself.

28:55.100 --> 28:58.024
I can't believe it.

29:03.900 --> 29:07.450
You know something?
I'm really proud of you.

29:07.612 --> 29:09.706
Wait. There's more.

29:13.118 --> 29:15.041
Open it.

29:21.585 --> 29:24.088
It's really beautiful.

29:29.885 --> 29:31.762
- What is it?
- It's a talisman.

29:31.970 --> 29:34.314
It'll protect you from...

29:34.473 --> 29:37.852
- From what?
- From everything.

29:38.059 --> 29:40.437
Even my physics professor?

29:40.645 --> 29:43.524
Mr. Bolton? Yes, especially him.

29:44.065 --> 29:46.318
You never take it off, okay?

29:48.111 --> 29:50.864
I promise. I love it.

30:17.724 --> 30:18.976
Jonathan?

30:20.560 --> 30:22.358
Dinner's ready!

30:23.855 --> 30:25.357
Jonathan?

30:28.235 --> 30:32.365
Are you OK? You look terrible.

30:34.574 --> 30:36.497
I'm fine.

30:36.660 --> 30:40.540
- Well, come and have dinner.
- No. I'm not eating.

30:42.040 --> 30:44.964
- Why not?
- I'm...

30:46.294 --> 30:48.137
I'm fasting.

30:49.881 --> 30:52.179
You're fasting?

30:59.391 --> 31:01.439
Jonathan, I don't know what you're up to,

31:01.643 --> 31:02.986
but I just cooked dinner for us.

31:06.273 --> 31:08.696
So you can do
whatever the hell you wanna do.

31:16.157 --> 31:19.206
O Paimon, I conjure thee.

31:20.245 --> 31:23.374
Empowered with the strength
of the greatest power.

31:38.930 --> 31:43.561
I command thee, creature of the water,

31:44.561 --> 31:48.156
bring forth life unto this world.

31:49.608 --> 31:54.990
I command thee, come. At once!

32:37.656 --> 32:39.499
Welcome to this world.

32:43.912 --> 32:45.755
I am your master.

32:55.799 --> 32:58.769
You may roam about the grounds,

32:59.594 --> 33:02.643
but you must remain invisible
to all but me.

33:04.557 --> 33:08.482
Remain obedient to me at all times.

33:12.148 --> 33:14.321
Understood?

33:36.506 --> 33:38.759
I call upon thee, Vepar,

33:39.008 --> 33:42.512
and thee, Procel, and thee, Ashtaroth.

33:43.930 --> 33:47.309
Bring forth the fury
of thy tempest before me.

33:47.475 --> 33:49.603
With these words:

33:49.769 --> 33:53.865
Non humus somnifera exsulat

33:54.065 --> 33:56.488
ignis et que erat.

33:57.026 --> 33:59.370
Somnifera facta sunt.

34:02.240 --> 34:05.164
Come. Now!

34:05.326 --> 34:07.579
Show me thy might!

34:07.746 --> 34:12.252
Come now, that I might
anoint myself with thy power!

34:13.460 --> 34:16.634
Yes! Come now!

34:34.355 --> 34:36.322
Yes! Yes!

35:01.090 --> 35:04.390
Thank you, Vepar, Procel, Ashtaroth,

35:04.552 --> 35:08.523
for having appeared and for
having fulfilled my request.

35:08.681 --> 35:11.935
Thou mayest depart in peace.

35:12.101 --> 35:15.275
Ye shall return when I call upon thee.

35:24.072 --> 35:28.077
Now, indeed you are a powerful instrument.

35:28.284 --> 35:29.627
Jonathan?

35:31.746 --> 35:33.623
What are you doing?

35:34.624 --> 35:38.879
Rebecca. You're home early.

35:39.462 --> 35:42.341
Would you please tell me
what's going on here?

35:51.266 --> 35:52.813
I get it.

35:54.936 --> 35:56.984
Oh, no. Don't change for me.

35:57.146 --> 35:59.615
I will leave you here to do
whatever it is you're doing,

35:59.816 --> 36:03.036
and I will go upstairs
and make dinner for myself,

36:03.194 --> 36:05.913
since you're not even eating these days.

36:06.114 --> 36:09.118
- No, Becky, wait.
- No, don't!

36:11.452 --> 36:15.173
Becky, listen to me! Becky, come on, wait!

36:17.917 --> 36:19.840
Rebecca.

36:20.753 --> 36:23.097
Look, will you listen...

36:27.385 --> 36:29.683
Look, talk to me.

36:47.906 --> 36:50.204
What the hell's going on here, Jonathan?

36:50.366 --> 36:53.085
You tell me that you
wanna drop out of school

36:53.286 --> 36:55.288
so that you can fix up the house.

36:55.455 --> 36:57.503
- Right?
- Right.

36:57.707 --> 37:00.711
So I come home and I find you...

37:01.669 --> 37:04.969
in the middle of I don't even know what.

37:08.509 --> 37:10.227
- Why'd you lie to me?
- I didn't lie to you.

37:10.428 --> 37:13.021
I have been working on the house.
That's all I've been doing.

37:14.349 --> 37:15.646
Look, I got sidetracked.

37:15.850 --> 37:18.444
I figure this stuff has got something
to do with my parents.

37:18.686 --> 37:21.155
I don't know who they were,
so I'm curious.

37:21.356 --> 37:22.733
Don't you understand that?

37:22.941 --> 37:24.568
No, I don't understand it, Jonathan.

37:24.776 --> 37:26.699
That's just the problem.
I don't understand.

37:26.903 --> 37:28.826
Don't do this to me.

37:29.030 --> 37:33.414
When I walked in that room, I saw
someone that I didn't even know.

37:34.160 --> 37:37.755
I saw... a stranger.

37:40.124 --> 37:41.797
Rebecca, please.

37:42.502 --> 37:46.132
Look, it's nothing. Honest.

37:47.382 --> 37:52.183
Look, I'll cut it out. I swear.

37:52.762 --> 37:55.106
Rebecca, I love you.

37:56.140 --> 37:58.017
You know that.

38:04.899 --> 38:07.823
I just get scared, that's all.

38:09.821 --> 38:12.290
It's the last time
you'll hear anything about it.

38:13.324 --> 38:14.667
I swear.

39:17.638 --> 39:18.981
Hi.

39:19.932 --> 39:21.058
Hi.

39:25.938 --> 39:28.737
- Rebecca.
- Hm?

39:28.941 --> 39:30.693
I love you.

39:31.569 --> 39:33.867
Well, I love you, too.

40:40.221 --> 40:42.315
What are you saying?

40:45.893 --> 40:47.770
What are you saying?

40:54.277 --> 40:57.076
What? Jonathan.

40:57.238 --> 40:59.206
What are you saying?

40:59.407 --> 41:02.001
Jonathan. What are you doing?

41:04.912 --> 41:08.041
Stop it! Jonathan!

41:08.207 --> 41:10.505
What are you doing?

41:19.218 --> 41:20.640
You bastard!

41:21.637 --> 41:24.607
- Becky.
- No, that's it. I've had it.

41:26.142 --> 41:28.361
- Listen...
- No, you listen to me.

41:28.561 --> 41:31.155
I've had it with your black magic,

41:31.355 --> 41:33.824
your rituals, your lies, everything.

41:34.901 --> 41:37.245
Goodbye, Jonathan.

41:43.242 --> 41:46.792
Leviatan, Ermogasa, Vmirteat, lorantga.

41:46.954 --> 41:50.208
Agtnaroi, Taetrimv, Asagomre, Nataivel.

41:50.833 --> 41:54.212
Leviatan, Ermogasa, Vmirteat, lorantga.

41:54.378 --> 41:58.383
Agtnaroi, Taetrimv, Asagomre, Nataivel!

42:19.528 --> 42:22.532
- We are here, Master.
- What would you have of us?

42:23.324 --> 42:25.292
I will have you serve me.

42:28.329 --> 42:29.501
That precisely...

42:29.705 --> 42:31.207
Is why you've called us, Master.

42:31.415 --> 42:34.464
- And we will.
- Most faithfully.

42:34.919 --> 42:39.095
Forsaking all others... you will obey me?

42:39.298 --> 42:42.222
- Unquestioningly.
- We are yours.

43:15.584 --> 43:16.927
Drink.

43:19.505 --> 43:20.506
How may we drink?

43:20.715 --> 43:23.264
If you do not release us
from the triangle.

43:23.426 --> 43:28.648
If you are worthy to serve me,
you will drink.

43:28.848 --> 43:32.398
If you are not worthy, you will burn.

43:33.060 --> 43:35.233
The choice is yours.

43:57.293 --> 44:00.797
- Me. Me first.
- No, me. Me first.

44:13.392 --> 44:15.815
Excellent. Well done.

44:27.156 --> 44:29.079
What are your names?

44:29.658 --> 44:32.582
- I'm called Grizzel.
- And I am called Greedigut.

44:32.787 --> 44:35.336
- And who am I?
- You are Jonathan.

44:35.498 --> 44:38.377
Our master. What is it you wish, Master?

44:38.584 --> 44:42.214
Knowledge. And power.

44:44.757 --> 44:46.725
These things we can do.

44:46.884 --> 44:50.434
What about Rebecca?
Do you want her as well?

44:50.596 --> 44:52.189
You know of Rebecca?

44:52.390 --> 44:54.984
We know of many things, O Master.

44:55.976 --> 44:59.947
- Yes, I want her.
- Then you shall have her.

45:00.106 --> 45:01.733
As for the other things you wish...

45:01.941 --> 45:03.284
There must be a master ritual.

45:03.442 --> 45:05.991
And there must be seven
others besides yourself.

45:06.153 --> 45:08.622
When the moon is full.

45:08.781 --> 45:11.785
The ritual is fraught with danger, Master.

45:11.951 --> 45:13.669
- Don't speak of it.
- What?

45:14.662 --> 45:18.132
- Answer me now!
- The ritual is dangerous.

45:18.290 --> 45:21.339
But you must perform it if
you wish to achieve knowledge.

45:21.502 --> 45:22.845
And power.

45:24.213 --> 45:25.886
And power.

46:14.930 --> 46:16.853
What do you want?

46:18.100 --> 46:21.479
You. I want you.

46:21.645 --> 46:25.991
I want you to come away with me now,
tonight, away from this house.

46:26.150 --> 46:29.370
No. Never.

46:29.570 --> 46:31.743
I could never leave this place.

46:40.080 --> 46:42.003
Your eyes.

46:42.875 --> 46:45.549
What have you done to your eyes?

46:45.711 --> 46:49.591
It's a sign. A sign of power.

46:52.051 --> 46:54.270
I don't want this.

46:54.970 --> 46:59.225
I love you, Jonathan, but I'm leaving.

46:59.391 --> 47:01.735
It's over!

47:05.397 --> 47:07.491
Becky, I love you.

47:18.702 --> 47:21.922
I'm so sorry, Jonathan.

47:22.081 --> 47:24.083
Please forgive me.

47:35.427 --> 47:37.646
The evil one had him now.

47:37.846 --> 47:42.439
The things that would be unleashed
that night were to be horrific.

47:42.643 --> 47:45.112
And I was powerless to stop it.

47:48.399 --> 47:50.993
What is that? Mushroom dip?

47:51.777 --> 47:53.529
There's a lot of it.

47:55.197 --> 47:58.417
- Nice house.
- It's really nice.

47:59.451 --> 48:01.829
Really grand, you know.
It's really special.

48:01.996 --> 48:03.248
I really feel so wonderful.

48:03.455 --> 48:05.128
You've invited me here and all that.

48:05.291 --> 48:06.543
You know what?

48:06.750 --> 48:09.299
You're a prince, an earl.
A prince among earls.

48:09.503 --> 48:11.426
King of the soirÃ©e.

48:12.673 --> 48:14.641
Bad manners, dude.

48:17.469 --> 48:20.564
I'm sorry. Rebecca, I'm really sorry.

48:22.433 --> 48:25.983
- Small faux pas.
- Don't worry about it, Mark.

48:26.186 --> 48:27.529
You know what they say:

48:27.730 --> 48:30.404
A faux pas a day helps
keep your friends away.

48:42.703 --> 48:44.956
- I'm really sorry.
- Mark, it's OK.

48:45.122 --> 48:47.045
No, it's not...

49:09.897 --> 49:12.400
How come you and Jonathan aren't eating?

49:15.611 --> 49:17.454
We ate already.

49:17.655 --> 49:20.329
Rebecca, why don't you sit down?

49:22.534 --> 49:24.332
All right, darling.

49:27.873 --> 49:30.217
Tell me, why are we wearing
these ridiculous glasses?

49:30.417 --> 49:32.090
I can barely see what I'm eating.

49:32.294 --> 49:35.218
It's all part of the evening
I have planned.

49:35.422 --> 49:36.639
It's gonna be great.

49:45.432 --> 49:46.979
A toast.

49:53.107 --> 49:57.078
To my friends. Forgive me.

49:57.653 --> 50:01.123
Mesabim, Etosa.

50:01.865 --> 50:04.288
Boros, Azote,

50:05.869 --> 50:07.792
Drink.

50:37.443 --> 50:39.741
Queladim!

50:43.073 --> 50:44.996
Come.

51:01.842 --> 51:06.188
Recabustira, Cabustira, Bustira, Tira, Ta.

51:06.388 --> 51:09.733
Hear me, all you hosts gathered here.

51:10.976 --> 51:13.195
Give me the knowledge.

51:13.353 --> 51:17.779
I will have the wisdom and the power!

51:20.569 --> 51:23.072
Answer me, my friends.

51:25.240 --> 51:27.334
Beseder, Eliele.

51:27.493 --> 51:29.086
Sepped, Eliele.

51:29.244 --> 51:31.497
Beseder, Eliele.

51:31.663 --> 51:33.256
Sepped, Eliele.

51:33.415 --> 51:35.463
Beseder, Eliele!

51:35.667 --> 51:37.340
Sepped, Eliele.

51:37.503 --> 51:40.427
Beseder, Eliele!

51:40.631 --> 51:42.304
Sepped, Eliele.

51:42.466 --> 51:50.726
- Beseder, Eliele!
- Sepped, Eliele.

51:52.142 --> 51:56.568
- Beseder, Eliele!
- Sepped, Eliele.

51:56.730 --> 52:02.737
Sepped, Eliele.
Sepped, Eliele. Sepped, Eliele.

52:04.530 --> 52:08.831
By the force of these
terrible words of power...

52:09.535 --> 52:15.087
Aglon! Tetragram! Retragrammaton!

52:16.500 --> 52:21.472
Soter Emanuel! Te invoco!

53:19.938 --> 53:23.659
A toast. To my friends.

53:32.451 --> 53:35.751
Rebecca and I are going to retire early.

53:35.913 --> 53:37.836
You're welcome to spend the night.

53:37.998 --> 53:40.797
The house is yours. Just pick a room.

53:42.085 --> 53:48.013
- Wine cellar.
- Oh! You madman. Yeah!

53:48.425 --> 53:51.850
- Good night, everyone.
- Good night.

53:57.935 --> 54:00.404
So... can't wait to pick a room.

54:37.099 --> 54:40.444
Children, your true master has returned,

54:40.644 --> 54:43.488
and tonight you will do my bidding.

54:48.026 --> 54:51.371
Baby, I've been waiting for
this moment ever since we met.

54:53.615 --> 54:55.492
All right!

55:03.375 --> 55:05.548
Mark, would you hurry up?

55:16.680 --> 55:18.774
God, it's kinda spooky out here.

55:20.726 --> 55:23.149
Wasn't Rebecca acting
kind of weird at dinner?

55:23.353 --> 55:25.071
I mean, the way she looked at me when I...

55:25.689 --> 55:27.612
- Gotcha!
- God!

55:29.109 --> 55:33.865
Come on. Let's sit down.
Come on over here. Come on.

55:34.031 --> 55:35.999
- Right here.
- That wasn't funny.

55:36.199 --> 55:38.122
Sorry.

55:43.999 --> 55:46.718
- Nice night.
- Spooky.

55:49.212 --> 55:52.261
Is that a little girl's tum?

55:52.424 --> 55:56.520
Don't, Mark! You're tickling me!
Please stop! Please stop!

55:58.722 --> 56:02.647
Sounds like Toad Boy's on the attack.

56:15.113 --> 56:17.457
Mark!

56:17.657 --> 56:20.331
My... Mark, my bracelet.

56:20.494 --> 56:23.418
Don't worry. I shall retrieve it.

56:26.041 --> 56:27.964
I can't see anything.

56:43.642 --> 56:46.191
Yuck! I touched something weird.

56:50.607 --> 56:51.904
Mark.

57:02.327 --> 57:04.250
What the hell's in there?

57:35.652 --> 57:38.781
Man, that chick is really a screamer.

57:50.917 --> 57:52.510
Where are you going?

57:53.420 --> 57:55.673
Water. Want some?

57:55.839 --> 57:57.762
No, thanks.

58:02.846 --> 58:05.770
- I'll be back.
- I'll be waiting.

58:59.486 --> 59:01.284
Who are you?

59:02.781 --> 59:04.704
Come here.

59:08.495 --> 59:11.965
No doubt about it, Mr. Dick.

59:12.165 --> 59:15.214
You are a lucky guy.

59:37.315 --> 59:39.363
Who are you?

01:00:04.843 --> 01:00:06.561
You got any matches?

01:00:08.388 --> 01:00:11.312
- Yeah. I got reserves.
- Great.

01:00:17.731 --> 01:00:21.326
You got any that work? Jeez!

01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:26.081
Well, there's gotta be some around here.

01:00:26.614 --> 01:00:28.537
I'll be back.

01:00:39.794 --> 01:00:41.387
I'm sorry, Rebecca.

01:00:41.588 --> 01:00:44.387
I'm sorry I had to do it this way.

01:00:46.676 --> 01:00:48.974
But it worked.

01:00:49.179 --> 01:00:52.934
It'll all be worth it. You'll see.

01:00:54.517 --> 01:00:57.441
I just hope you can forgive me.

01:01:02.442 --> 01:01:04.365
Jonathan?

01:01:07.322 --> 01:01:09.245
What am I...?

01:01:30.303 --> 01:01:32.397
I'll tell you about it in the morning.

01:01:33.056 --> 01:01:35.104
Yeah, I'm so tired.

01:01:37.644 --> 01:01:39.567
Sleep now.

01:02:04.170 --> 01:02:05.763
Matches.

01:02:06.464 --> 01:02:08.137
Matches...

01:02:08.716 --> 01:02:10.343
Matches...

01:02:14.347 --> 01:02:16.270
Nah.

01:02:50.008 --> 01:02:52.511
No, don't do it here.

01:02:53.636 --> 01:02:57.357
- Outside.
- Yes, all right.

01:02:58.975 --> 01:03:00.898
Pull!

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:11.788
Shit.

01:03:13.114 --> 01:03:15.037
Where's that guy?

01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:24.838
There it is. Get it.

01:03:26.419 --> 01:03:30.344
- I despise these creatures.
- Quiet!

01:03:58.910 --> 01:04:00.628
Malcolm is the master, blast his soul.

01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:03.248
He always has been
and will be until you rot.

01:04:03.456 --> 01:04:04.503
No, it is not so.

01:04:04.707 --> 01:04:06.709
I cannot do this thing. I cannot.

01:04:06.918 --> 01:04:10.138
Ooh! Oh! Ow! Oh!

01:04:11.673 --> 01:04:14.927
Quiet. Quiet. He'll burn us both.

01:04:42.161 --> 01:04:45.791
Hey, dude. Don't bogart that joint.

01:06:22.470 --> 01:06:27.601
Come to me. Come to me, my children.

01:06:27.767 --> 01:06:29.940
All of you.

01:06:30.103 --> 01:06:32.652
Let me show you my love.

01:06:35.233 --> 01:06:37.156
Come to me now.

01:07:19.193 --> 01:07:20.740
Jonathan?

01:07:20.903 --> 01:07:23.406
Oh, boy. What a dream.

01:08:13.456 --> 01:08:15.550
Why, Jonathan? Why?

01:08:15.750 --> 01:08:17.171
Becky!

01:08:20.171 --> 01:08:22.469
No!

01:08:29.471 --> 01:08:30.939
Becky?

01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:34.602
No.

01:08:36.395 --> 01:08:37.772
Becky.

01:08:38.481 --> 01:08:40.404
My God.

01:08:43.069 --> 01:08:47.073
I can make you live. I've got the power.

01:09:06.216 --> 01:09:08.094
Becky.

01:09:13.307 --> 01:09:17.062
Where's my robe? Where the hell's my robe?

01:09:57.768 --> 01:10:00.271
Aren't you going to greet your father?

01:10:01.230 --> 01:10:03.653
You did my bidding well, Jonathan.

01:10:04.525 --> 01:10:06.243
You...

01:10:06.402 --> 01:10:09.326
Grizzel, Greedigut.

01:10:09.530 --> 01:10:12.704
You tricked me. I'm your master.

01:10:12.909 --> 01:10:16.129
No! I am the master.

01:10:16.329 --> 01:10:21.176
I own them as I now own you.

01:10:22.835 --> 01:10:27.716
Come... and greet your father.

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:34.481
Vepar, Procel, Ashtaroth. Help me now!

01:10:39.602 --> 01:10:43.698
Where are your gods now?
They too are mine.

01:10:48.277 --> 01:10:50.575
Not bad.

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:55.626
Although at your age I was much better.

01:10:57.411 --> 01:10:59.379
You...

01:10:59.538 --> 01:11:01.882
You killed them.

01:11:03.250 --> 01:11:05.173
You killed Rebecca.

01:11:06.253 --> 01:11:07.926
Hm?

01:11:08.089 --> 01:11:10.592
Yes, I suppose I did.

01:11:12.551 --> 01:11:14.679
But it was you I really wanted, Jonathan.

01:11:14.887 --> 01:11:16.639
You were to resurrect me.

01:11:16.847 --> 01:11:21.774
And what should have happened
25 years ago will happen now.

01:11:25.231 --> 01:11:27.233
I will have your youth, Jonathan.

01:11:34.490 --> 01:11:38.586
Greater things
command all of us, Jonathan.

01:11:40.121 --> 01:11:43.796
I suppose that in another time,
another place,

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.254
I could have loved you as my son.

01:11:53.092 --> 01:11:56.016
My soul is not my own,

01:11:56.220 --> 01:12:01.397
and you must be my sacrifice to Lucifer.

01:12:14.321 --> 01:12:17.416
Again... a good effort.

01:12:18.993 --> 01:12:22.213
But it is your love
that weakens you, Jonathan.

01:12:23.831 --> 01:12:26.084
You can never oppose me.

01:12:30.671 --> 01:12:32.594
A shame.

01:12:34.341 --> 01:12:36.435
She's so pretty.

01:12:36.594 --> 01:12:39.518
May you rot!

01:12:45.686 --> 01:12:48.235
- Becky.
- Jonathan.

01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:51.942
Forgive me.

01:12:52.151 --> 01:12:55.325
I love you, Jonathan. Please.

01:12:57.615 --> 01:13:01.245
Take me away from here. Take me.

01:13:02.036 --> 01:13:04.710
Hold me.

01:13:05.581 --> 01:13:07.174
Kiss me.

01:13:09.001 --> 01:13:10.924
I love you.

01:13:11.629 --> 01:13:16.635
- Oh, Becky. I'm so sorry.
- It's all right, my love.

01:13:19.136 --> 01:13:20.854
Come to me.

01:13:21.597 --> 01:13:24.271
No, Master Jonathan. Don't listen.

01:13:24.433 --> 01:13:26.435
It's a trap, yes!

01:13:26.644 --> 01:13:28.817
No!

01:13:29.396 --> 01:13:32.821
You little worms!
You shall burn for this later.

01:13:33.025 --> 01:13:37.952
But now... I am tired of playing.

01:13:40.533 --> 01:13:43.082
You try my patience.

01:14:05.516 --> 01:14:10.192
You are my life...
and I will have my life!

01:14:10.855 --> 01:14:13.574
Kiss me, my son.

01:14:13.732 --> 01:14:15.655
Kiss me.

01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:19.285
Let me drain the life from your lips.

01:14:24.451 --> 01:14:27.955
You will not have the boy's life!

01:14:28.539 --> 01:14:33.420
You are no match for me, old man.

01:15:10.748 --> 01:15:14.218
Die, evil one!

01:15:45.241 --> 01:15:49.462
Get out of here while you still can!

01:16:34.164 --> 01:16:36.087
No. No.

01:16:39.086 --> 01:16:42.932
Dick, come on, wake up.
We gotta get outta here.

01:16:43.090 --> 01:16:46.264
- Come on! Let's go.
- Jonathan. How?

01:16:46.427 --> 01:16:48.350
Don't ask.

01:16:58.856 --> 01:17:02.110
- Mark, what's going on?
- Just get in the car.

01:17:02.276 --> 01:17:04.779
You got a cigarette on you?

01:17:30.637 --> 01:17:33.686
Would somebody mind telling me
what the hell is going on?

01:17:33.849 --> 01:17:37.353
It's a long story, Mike.
But it's over now.

01:17:38.687 --> 01:17:42.317
Is it, Jonathan? Is it really?

01:17:42.483 --> 01:17:44.406
Yeah, really.
