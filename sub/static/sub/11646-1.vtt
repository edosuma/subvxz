00:16.160 --> 00:17.599
Give me the mother-fucking case!

00:17.600 --> 00:19.359
Back off! Stay back!

00:19.360 --> 00:22.079
Give me the case or I swear
I will cave your fucking skull in!

00:22.080 --> 00:26.079
I'm going to saw your fucking
legs off you dick... Oh, shit!

00:26.080 --> 00:28.439
Me and you, we're friends,

00:28.440 --> 00:31.439
we bonded... like the end of Titanic,
remember? Come on. Give me the case!

00:31.440 --> 00:33.719
Fuck the end of Titanic! Fuck Kate,

00:33.720 --> 00:37.719
fuck Leo, and fuck you!

00:58.160 --> 01:00.119
Don't.

01:00.120 --> 01:02.559
What?

01:02.560 --> 01:05.639
Make small talk. I hate small talk.

01:05.640 --> 01:07.239
Me too.

01:07.240 --> 01:09.119
Hate the small talkers.

01:09.120 --> 01:13.119
Like me mum. What a twat.

01:13.240 --> 01:17.079
That was probably a bit harsh.
She can't help it.

01:17.080 --> 01:20.919
Not since the stroke.
That was a joke.

01:20.920 --> 01:22.319
Me mum hasn't had a stroke!

01:22.320 --> 01:24.719
She did recently
have a hysterectomy.

01:24.720 --> 01:27.239
Not a whole lot of laughs that week.

01:27.240 --> 01:28.679
Oh, my God. The crying!

01:28.680 --> 01:31.119
"They took my womanhood!"

01:31.120 --> 01:34.599
I was like, "Mum!

01:34.600 --> 01:38.599
"Spare me the graphic,
biological details."

01:43.960 --> 01:47.959
Did they tell you nine o'clock?
Cos they said nine to me.

02:03.400 --> 02:06.359
Oh, yes! Fuck me harder!

02:06.360 --> 02:10.359
Oh, yes, I like it when you do that.
Oh!

02:15.440 --> 02:18.399
Who are you?

02:18.400 --> 02:22.039
We're here for our
Community Service.

02:22.040 --> 02:22.959
Who are you?

02:22.960 --> 02:25.919
I am your probation worker.

02:25.920 --> 02:28.799
Fuck this tight
little ass hole!

02:28.800 --> 02:30.479
That's not... That is just wrong.

02:30.480 --> 02:33.719
That is not how,
that is not how God intended it.

02:33.720 --> 02:36.199
Bloody spam emails. Deleted.

02:36.200 --> 02:37.479
Oh, yes!

02:37.480 --> 02:39.519
Wow.

02:39.520 --> 02:41.359
Unusual...

02:41.360 --> 02:43.799
This is repulsive,
some of this stuff...

02:43.800 --> 02:46.159
Oh, yes, my shit tastes
so good on your cock!

02:46.160 --> 02:50.159
Somebody's daughter!

02:51.200 --> 02:55.199
You want a Nacho?

02:57.080 --> 02:59.319
This isn't going to end well for ya.

02:59.320 --> 03:01.799
You already lost a hand.

03:01.800 --> 03:05.799
There's only so many limbs
a guy can do without.

03:09.760 --> 03:13.119
Give me the combination
for the briefcase

03:13.120 --> 03:17.119
and we can all go home
and have a nice cup of tea.

03:22.160 --> 03:25.559
Fuck you.

03:31.840 --> 03:32.959
What?

03:32.960 --> 03:36.959
I think we might have a problem.

03:45.938 --> 04:25.978
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

04:34.880 --> 04:38.719
They show up here the day
after we get the briefcase.

04:38.720 --> 04:41.239
They're not on Community Service.
It's bullshit.

04:41.240 --> 04:43.719
I'm all over it.

04:43.720 --> 04:46.119
Those poor, deluded fools
are under the misguided belief

04:46.120 --> 04:50.119
that I am their probation worker.
Turns out that I am quite the actor.

04:52.680 --> 04:54.999
I'll see if the briefcase guy
knows anything about them.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.559
He's a stubborn bastard,
I'll give him that.

04:57.560 --> 05:01.559
Let me know if you want me to come
round there and squidge his bollocks
with a pair of pliers for him, eh?

05:38.840 --> 05:41.159
Piece of shit!

05:47.720 --> 05:51.719
Shit.

05:52.560 --> 05:56.559
Fuck!

05:57.040 --> 06:00.359
Bastard!

06:00.360 --> 06:02.999
What are you doing?

06:03.000 --> 06:06.439
I...

06:06.440 --> 06:10.159
I, I, I am looking for a,
for a sandwich.

06:10.160 --> 06:14.159
I put it in one of these
lockers for safe keeping.

06:14.400 --> 06:17.519
But I'll be buggered
if I can remember which one it's in.

06:17.520 --> 06:21.239
I bloody hate it
when I misplace a sandwich.

06:21.240 --> 06:24.279
Me too. It's extremely upsetting.

06:24.280 --> 06:25.559
What kind of sandwich was it?

06:25.560 --> 06:27.559
It was cheese,
it was a cheese sandwich.

06:27.560 --> 06:31.159
Perhaps a mouse ate it.

06:31.160 --> 06:33.199
Those furry little bastards
do love a bit of cheese.

06:33.200 --> 06:35.559
They do. Bloody mice.

06:35.560 --> 06:36.719
Hmm.

06:36.720 --> 06:40.719
Now you'll have to excuse me
though, cos I have very important

06:41.520 --> 06:45.519
probation worker business to attend
to, for I am a probation worker.

06:49.560 --> 06:53.559
Shit!

06:54.520 --> 06:58.519
Just put that back on there.
Safety is very important.

07:00.720 --> 07:01.759
That's...

07:01.760 --> 07:05.759
poor craftsmanship, that is.

07:34.040 --> 07:37.599
Shut up! Stop making me
out to be the bad guy.

07:37.600 --> 07:39.879
This is a situation
entirely of your own making.

07:39.880 --> 07:42.599
Your bollocks are going to
freeze into little hairy ice cubes

07:42.600 --> 07:44.199
unless you tell me
where that case is.

07:44.200 --> 07:46.999
I'm taking that as well...
a Cornetto.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.999
No Cornetto for you mate.

07:54.080 --> 07:56.359
You know how you said
this was a weird set up?

07:56.360 --> 08:00.359
So it turns out the probation worker
has someone locked in a freezer.

08:01.040 --> 08:03.959
Why would anyone hold someone
captive in a freezer?

08:03.960 --> 08:07.559
I'm sure there's a perfectly
reasonable explanation for it.

08:07.560 --> 08:10.519
OK. You give me a perfectly
reasonable explanation

08:10.520 --> 08:14.519
for locking someone in a freezer.

08:17.480 --> 08:20.319
Do we need to get involved?

08:20.320 --> 08:24.239
What if we pretend
you didn't see it?

08:24.240 --> 08:28.239
How's that sitting with you?
Cos that feels good to me.

08:32.080 --> 08:34.759
I was just getting a Bounty.

08:34.760 --> 08:38.759
Whereas I am eating a Cornetto...

08:40.960 --> 08:44.959
for I am a probation worker
and that is what we eat.

08:54.080 --> 08:58.079
We need to get that guy
out of the freezer.

09:09.200 --> 09:13.199
Ring a ding, ding, ding!

09:15.280 --> 09:19.279
Bitch!

09:45.560 --> 09:49.559
That's a definite
ball tightening moment.

09:53.040 --> 09:54.039
What's going on?

09:54.040 --> 09:55.639
Well either there's a fire,

09:55.640 --> 09:58.639
or someone is attempting
to fuck with us. Stay with him.

10:07.160 --> 10:11.159
The question is,
how much is a bollock worth to you?

10:13.600 --> 10:15.719
Fuck you.

10:15.720 --> 10:16.759
Argh!

10:16.760 --> 10:20.759
What was that?
That didn't sound good.

10:21.520 --> 10:25.519
Shit!

10:36.720 --> 10:40.679
OK, so the probation worker
keeps a guy locked in a freezer.

10:40.680 --> 10:42.199
It's certainly unusual.

10:42.200 --> 10:46.079
Is he dead? He looks dead.

10:46.080 --> 10:50.079
If we go now, we can still
catch the start of Countdown.

10:58.160 --> 11:01.439
Who are you? He sent you,
didn't he? Where's the briefcase?

11:01.440 --> 11:02.759
Where's the case?!

11:02.760 --> 11:06.759
I don't know. I don't know
anything about any case!

11:07.960 --> 11:09.599
You're welcome!

11:09.600 --> 11:12.199
This is why you should
never get involved.

11:12.200 --> 11:13.719
Not so much as a thank you.

11:13.720 --> 11:17.719
You let him out! Jesus!
You shouldn't have done that!

11:17.840 --> 11:20.199
What the fuck is going on?

11:20.200 --> 11:24.119
Imagine the bloke in the
freezer is a giant shit.

11:24.120 --> 11:26.199
And over here,
we have a great big fan.

11:26.200 --> 11:28.075
Shit and then you got the fan...

11:37.768 --> 11:39.647
I'm going to level with you.

11:39.723 --> 11:43.722
Hmm? So prepare to be shocked, huh?

11:44.483 --> 11:48.482
Surprised, and more than
a little bit amazed.

11:51.643 --> 11:55.642
For I am not in fact
your probation worker.

11:55.923 --> 11:58.242
Really?

11:58.243 --> 12:02.242
No shit? You should think
about becoming an actor.

12:02.483 --> 12:04.162
I know! I know.

12:04.163 --> 12:08.162
I know. Just check this out.

12:14.403 --> 12:16.162
The truth is,

12:16.163 --> 12:20.162
like you,
I am also on Community Service.

12:25.963 --> 12:27.482
It all started yesterday.

12:27.483 --> 12:30.322
There we were, we were all gathered
around the vending machine

12:30.323 --> 12:33.042
after another
arse-numbingly boring day.

12:33.043 --> 12:35.402
Our mate Seth
had just come back from Africa

12:35.403 --> 12:38.482
and he had quite a story to tell.

12:38.483 --> 12:40.882
So we end up travelling to Uganda.

12:40.883 --> 12:44.882
And we're in this village and some
kid wanders into a minefield,

12:45.283 --> 12:47.042
ends up standing on a mine.

12:47.043 --> 12:48.722
If he moves, he's dead.

12:48.723 --> 12:52.722
Kelly marches over, does her rocket
science thing and defuses the mine.

12:53.523 --> 12:55.922
Kelly? She defused a mine?

12:55.923 --> 12:58.242
The villagers love her
out there, man,

12:58.243 --> 12:59.362
they're all singing and dancing...

12:59.363 --> 13:02.122
Nachos...

13:02.123 --> 13:05.682
or a Twix?

13:05.683 --> 13:09.682
Sweet or savoury?
It's man's eternal dilemma.

13:10.683 --> 13:13.642
So anyway,
I'm just back to get our stuff.

13:13.643 --> 13:16.242
Kelly's fucking off
her Community Service.

13:16.243 --> 13:20.242
We're going to stay out there and...
defuse landmines.

13:20.683 --> 13:22.682
She's not coming back.

13:22.683 --> 13:24.442
Who?
Kelly.

13:24.443 --> 13:26.922
What?!

13:26.923 --> 13:29.682
She's not coming back?!
When was this decided?

13:29.683 --> 13:32.002
Do we not...? I mean,
do we get a say in any...?

13:32.003 --> 13:33.562
I am shocked and I am reeling.

13:33.563 --> 13:36.442
I'm going to get some chocolate
because I'm really upset.

13:47.923 --> 13:51.922
Dude? You all right, mate?

13:53.483 --> 13:57.482
They're all after it.

13:58.483 --> 14:02.482
It's my money...

14:05.483 --> 14:07.682
So this money he's talking about
must be in the briefcase.

14:07.683 --> 14:09.162
It's got a combination lock.

14:09.163 --> 14:11.722
Can we not just get a bloody big
hammer and chisel and bust it open?

14:11.723 --> 14:14.122
If you open it without
the combination it activates

14:14.123 --> 14:17.362
one of these dye-pack things.
It stains the money. It's unusable.

14:17.363 --> 14:20.042
Since when did you become
such a bloody expert?

14:20.043 --> 14:21.482
I watch a lot of heist movies.

14:21.483 --> 14:24.002
I can't get into them,
there's too many twists and turns.

14:24.003 --> 14:26.642
I like a nice,
straightforward Western.

14:26.643 --> 14:30.642
There must be a key
for those handcuffs.

14:41.963 --> 14:45.642
Shut up.

14:45.643 --> 14:49.642
Oh... I've got a brilliant idea.

14:51.123 --> 14:53.962
Why don't you two go home, hmm?

14:53.963 --> 14:57.642
Kick back, just chill out.

14:57.643 --> 15:01.642
I'll selflessly stay here. I'm gonna
take care of our injured friend.

15:02.203 --> 15:04.642
Just call me Nurse Rudy.

15:04.643 --> 15:06.522
He's a big guy.

15:06.523 --> 15:09.882
If he needs a crap, it'll take
two of us to take him to the toilet.

15:09.883 --> 15:13.882
Why don't I stay here
and give you a hand?

15:13.923 --> 15:15.922
Really?

15:15.923 --> 15:18.122
It's cool. I'll just let him
shit his pants.

15:18.123 --> 15:20.362
I was trained by
St John's fuckin' Ambulance

15:20.363 --> 15:24.362
so if anyone's staying,
I should stay.

15:24.883 --> 15:28.882
Well, that settles it, then.
It's a sleepover, isn't it?

15:50.523 --> 15:51.922
Excalibur...

15:51.923 --> 15:55.922
Stop making me do things
that I don't want to do.

15:57.763 --> 16:00.202
Goodness me...

16:00.203 --> 16:01.682
Are you knocking one out?

16:01.683 --> 16:05.162
No.

16:05.163 --> 16:08.802
It's just a quick cheeky one
to get me to sleep.

16:08.803 --> 16:12.802
I have to feed the monster, man.

16:13.483 --> 16:17.482
Tell him.

16:17.883 --> 16:19.322
It's a sedative, innit?

16:19.323 --> 16:21.882
Just hurry up and finish, man.

16:23.923 --> 16:27.162
Fucking... Barbara! Ohh.

16:27.163 --> 16:28.842
You are going to go blind.

16:28.843 --> 16:31.602
That's what me old headmaster,
Mr Gibbons, used to say to me,

16:31.603 --> 16:35.602
until some nasty little shit
threw sulphuric acid into his face.

16:35.963 --> 16:38.762
Who's laughing - and seeing - now?

16:38.763 --> 16:40.282
Cos it's not him.

16:40.283 --> 16:41.842
Just get on with it,
you silly little prick!

16:41.843 --> 16:44.002
Whoa! I'm a storyteller, love,

16:44.003 --> 16:48.002
I'm merely trying to paint a vivid
picture for me audience here.

16:50.563 --> 16:53.562
Where's the briefcase? Which
one of you fuckers took the case?!

16:53.563 --> 16:56.482
I don't know anything about it.
How do we know you didn't take it?

16:56.483 --> 17:00.482
Cos I know what I did and didn't do
and I know I didn't take the case.

17:01.163 --> 17:02.402
It was you, wasn't it?

17:02.403 --> 17:04.642
You think I've crept in here
in the middle of the night

17:04.643 --> 17:07.402
while you were sleeping and I've
cut his hand off with a hacksaw?

17:07.403 --> 17:08.521
I think that's exactly what you did.

17:08.522 --> 17:10.482
Do you? All right, then, genius.

17:10.483 --> 17:14.482
If I took the case,
then why am I still here?

17:14.603 --> 17:15.801
Sorry, what was that?

17:15.803 --> 17:19.162
Not as clever as you think,
are you? Smack down!

17:19.163 --> 17:22.682
You're still here because you need
the combination to the briefcase,

17:22.683 --> 17:24.162
and this guy is
the only one who has it.

17:24.163 --> 17:27.602
All right, yeah,
that's a good point.

17:27.603 --> 17:29.482
So whoever did take the case

17:29.483 --> 17:31.602
is probably close by waiting for
Stumpy to regain consciousness.

17:31.603 --> 17:32.722
Also true.

17:32.723 --> 17:33.922
We need to search
the Community Centre.

17:33.923 --> 17:37.922
Oh, you beat me to it.
I was just about to say that.

17:56.723 --> 17:59.722
It was Seth.

17:59.723 --> 18:02.522
He took the case, didn't he?

18:02.523 --> 18:04.042
Why d'you say that?

18:04.043 --> 18:06.282
I can feel it in my nut sack.

18:06.283 --> 18:09.882
You know what he's like.
He's sneaky and he's underhand.

18:09.883 --> 18:13.762
And he makes cruel jokes about you
behind your back.

18:13.763 --> 18:17.762
He's all this. "His cock's
like a little fuckin' slug."

18:19.043 --> 18:19.882
Did he... did he say that?

18:19.883 --> 18:21.602
Mm-hmm.

18:21.603 --> 18:25.162
What, has he seen...
Has he seen my cock?

18:25.163 --> 18:26.442
Well, what are you saying?

18:26.443 --> 18:30.442
I'm saying we should drug his drink
and lock him in the freezer

18:30.523 --> 18:34.522
until he tells us
where the briefcase is.

18:35.603 --> 18:38.442
'So you were going to drug
this guy Seth?'

18:38.443 --> 18:39.882
But it was Curtis...

18:39.883 --> 18:41.842
He was the one in the freezer?

18:41.843 --> 18:44.002
You seem just as obsessed

18:44.003 --> 18:46.602
with the briefcase as the others.
This is bullshit.

18:46.603 --> 18:50.322
All right, you've got me. Busted.

18:50.323 --> 18:53.522
I believe I am what is
commonly referred to

18:53.523 --> 18:57.122
as an "unreliable narrator". Mmm?

18:57.123 --> 18:59.042
See, Curtis was right.

18:59.043 --> 19:01.842
'I did sneak out
in the middle of the night

19:01.843 --> 19:05.842
'while they were dreaming
their happy little dreams.'

19:20.483 --> 19:24.482
Fucking hell.

19:32.403 --> 19:36.402
Fuck it!

20:08.803 --> 20:12.802
Bingo!

20:40.203 --> 20:42.802
'So having gone to investigate
the mysterious noise,

20:42.803 --> 20:44.722
'I returned to the room.

20:44.723 --> 20:46.482
'Only to find...

20:46.483 --> 20:48.962
'that the case had vanished!'

20:48.963 --> 20:51.002
Fuck!

20:51.003 --> 20:52.482
So I go back to sleep...

20:52.483 --> 20:55.642
well, I slipped in
a cheeky little sunrise wank.

20:55.643 --> 20:58.162
And then I acted all dumb,
yeah, innocent.

20:58.163 --> 21:00.442
And do you know what?
You were right, mate.

21:00.443 --> 21:04.442
It wasn't me and Curtis having a
little chat by the vending machine.

21:04.443 --> 21:06.162
'It was me and Seth.'

21:06.163 --> 21:10.162
It was Curtis. He's the one
who took the case, isn't he?

21:10.643 --> 21:11.922
Why d'you say that?

21:11.923 --> 21:13.882
I can feel it in my nut sack.

21:13.883 --> 21:17.882
You know what he's like.
He is sneaky and he's underhand.

21:17.883 --> 21:21.882
And he makes cruel jokes about
your girlfriend behind her back.

21:22.923 --> 21:25.962
It's all this.

21:25.963 --> 21:29.962
"Her mouth is so massive,
the only way you can shut her up

21:31.483 --> 21:33.682
"is to wedge one of her tits
in there, innit."

21:33.683 --> 21:35.082
He said that about Kelly?

21:35.083 --> 21:36.322
Huh...

21:36.323 --> 21:39.722
Two-faced bastard.

21:39.723 --> 21:41.002
So what are you saying?

21:41.003 --> 21:45.002
I'm saying we should drug his drink
and lock him in the freezer

21:45.283 --> 21:49.282
until he tells us
where the briefcase is.

21:54.723 --> 21:58.722
Beverage?

21:59.203 --> 22:02.842
How sneaky am I, eh? Shame on me.

22:02.843 --> 22:06.842
See, I think
Curtis was in cahoots...

22:07.683 --> 22:09.442
Cahoots is a great word.

22:09.443 --> 22:13.442
I think Curtis was in cahoots
with two other people,

22:14.003 --> 22:17.282
who just so happen
to conveniently turn up

22:17.283 --> 22:21.002
at the Community Centre this morning
wearing their orange jumpsuits,

22:21.003 --> 22:22.562
claiming they're
on Community Service.

22:22.563 --> 22:24.362
Can you see where I'm going?

22:24.363 --> 22:26.682
You lost me at cahoots.

22:26.683 --> 22:28.042
Unbelievable.

22:28.043 --> 22:30.562
He's spiked our drinks.

22:30.563 --> 22:32.842
No!

22:34.203 --> 22:37.722
When was this?

22:37.723 --> 22:39.602
Let's not beat ourselves up
about it.

22:39.603 --> 22:42.242
I mean, I have, I've bamboozled you
with me devious cunning,

22:42.243 --> 22:46.042
for I have been spinning you a yarn
this whole time

22:46.043 --> 22:50.042
waiting for the drugs to kick in,
which should be right about no wish.

22:50.523 --> 22:52.722
Easy.

22:52.723 --> 22:53.842
Go with it.

22:53.843 --> 22:57.842
Just let it wash over you.
It's like a gentle autumn breeze.

23:06.203 --> 23:08.122
Ooh, eh?

23:08.123 --> 23:09.834
Sleepytime for bobos.

23:19.292 --> 23:22.211
What the fuck?!

23:22.212 --> 23:23.411
Who is that? Is that you?

23:23.483 --> 23:25.162
Of course it's me!
Who else would it be?

23:25.816 --> 23:28.935
Oh my God. What's that?
There's something moving in my hand.

23:28.936 --> 23:30.835
That's my tit.

23:30.897 --> 23:33.416
Oh, sorry.

23:33.417 --> 23:35.016
Just stop touching my tits!

23:35.017 --> 23:38.256
I was trying to find me phone.

23:38.257 --> 23:42.256
It's not in my bra!

23:42.817 --> 23:43.976
There's no signal, you?

23:43.977 --> 23:45.496
Never when you really need it.

23:45.497 --> 23:47.256
Help! Help!

23:47.325 --> 23:48.644
Shh.

23:48.645 --> 23:52.484
Hey. Relax.

23:52.485 --> 23:55.084
He's just messing with us.

23:55.085 --> 23:59.084
This is probably all part of
some elaborate initiation ritual,

24:00.605 --> 24:03.884
you know like in those posh,
private schools where they

24:03.885 --> 24:07.044
toast crumpets
and eat each other's shit.

24:07.045 --> 24:09.884
You are so naive.
You're a paedophile's wet dream.

24:09.885 --> 24:12.404
"Hey, little boy. Do you want
to come with me into the bushes

24:12.405 --> 24:16.404
"and suck on
my cock-shaped lollipop?"

24:17.205 --> 24:21.204
What?

24:22.925 --> 24:26.844
Wasn't in the bushes.

24:26.845 --> 24:30.844
It was at me uncle's house.

24:31.605 --> 24:35.604
He had this...
big, old house in the country.

24:38.605 --> 24:42.604
It was surrounded by corn fields.

24:43.085 --> 24:47.084
It was beautiful.

24:47.165 --> 24:51.164
I used to stay there in the summer
when I was a kid.

24:53.045 --> 24:57.044
Every night,
my uncle came to my room.

24:58.005 --> 25:02.004
I can still feel him on top of me...

25:02.605 --> 25:06.604
the smell of whiskey
and cigarettes on his breath...

25:09.165 --> 25:13.164
after he raped me.

25:14.685 --> 25:18.684
I'd feel his tears falling
on me face, like salty rain.

25:28.325 --> 25:31.524
I'm joking.

25:31.525 --> 25:33.444
You prick!

25:33.445 --> 25:34.924
I thought you were being serious.

25:34.925 --> 25:35.964
Ouch! Jesus!

25:35.965 --> 25:37.324
You dick! Why would you do that?

25:37.325 --> 25:38.724
I was trying to lighten the mood.

25:38.725 --> 25:41.604
You think a story about you getting
horribly raped by your uncle

25:41.605 --> 25:43.204
is going to lighten the mood?

25:43.205 --> 25:46.164
I'm just saying. It could be worse.

25:46.165 --> 25:50.164
You could be locked in a freezer
with me imaginary, rapist uncle.

25:51.405 --> 25:55.404
Suddenly,
things don't seem quite so bad.

25:55.645 --> 25:57.324
Help! Help!!

25:57.325 --> 26:01.324
I've done both bollocks, a couple
of fingers and his bell-end.

26:02.885 --> 26:05.844
What did he say?

26:05.845 --> 26:09.284
He said "ouch" and "fuck you".

26:09.285 --> 26:11.964
So what do we do with him?

26:11.965 --> 26:15.964
Put him on ice
until he's ready to talk.

26:20.085 --> 26:24.084
Is it just me or is it reminding you
of the end of Titanic?

26:24.405 --> 26:28.404
I'm going to die in a freezer on
my first day of Community Service.

26:33.125 --> 26:36.444
I thought I'd have kids,
grow old and ugly.

26:36.445 --> 26:40.444
I'd die in my sleep
with all my family around me.

26:41.365 --> 26:44.724
I always thought
I'd die in a car crash.

26:44.725 --> 26:47.564
A silver Mercedes 300SL Gullwing.

26:47.565 --> 26:51.004
I'm off my head
on prescription painkillers.

26:51.005 --> 26:54.884
Just finished getting sucked off
by Angelina Jolie.

26:54.885 --> 26:57.564
I open me eyes and bang!

26:57.565 --> 27:00.164
I hit a tree,
a big, fuck-off oak tree,

27:00.165 --> 27:03.924
on top of a hill,
looking out at the sea.

27:03.925 --> 27:07.924
Angelina lives,
but she's horribly disfigured.

27:10.845 --> 27:13.364
Sadie?

27:13.365 --> 27:17.204
Who's Sadie?

27:17.205 --> 27:19.124
Me dog.

27:19.125 --> 27:20.684
If I die,
who's going to feed me dog?

27:27.565 --> 27:30.164
Are you dying?

27:30.165 --> 27:34.164
I...I really need a wee.

27:34.605 --> 27:36.044
I have a small bladder.

27:36.045 --> 27:38.004
Don't mind me if you want to...

27:38.005 --> 27:39.884
I'm not going to piss myself
in front of you.

27:39.885 --> 27:42.004
What if we piss ourselves
in front of each other?

27:42.005 --> 27:44.524
There's no shame in that.

27:44.525 --> 27:47.604
Do you want to freestyle
or do you want to synchronise,

27:47.605 --> 27:50.044
on the count of three?

27:50.045 --> 27:51.484
Oh, this can't be happening.

27:51.485 --> 27:53.804
Are you pissing in your pants
or are you getting it out?

27:53.805 --> 27:54.964
Pissing in my pants.

27:54.965 --> 27:58.004
OK!

27:58.005 --> 28:00.204
I'm going to just...

28:00.205 --> 28:02.004
There he is.

28:02.005 --> 28:05.084
All right?

28:05.085 --> 28:07.404
Here we go. On three...

28:07.405 --> 28:09.004
Will you please just shut the fuck up
and let me piss myself?

28:09.005 --> 28:13.004
OK.

28:31.565 --> 28:35.564
I really hope you don't need a shit.

28:37.925 --> 28:39.284
What are you doing?!

28:40.485 --> 28:43.684
We don't know anything about
any briefcase!

28:43.685 --> 28:46.724
We just want to go home
and watch Countdown!

28:46.725 --> 28:47.844
I've got a dog!

28:47.845 --> 28:50.404
We're going to die in here.

28:50.405 --> 28:53.004
What if they really are two innocent
young offenders who just

28:53.005 --> 28:54.764
showed up here this morning
to do their Community Service?

28:54.765 --> 28:56.764
I believe you will find
there's no such thing as

28:56.765 --> 28:59.724
an innocent young offender,
is there?

28:59.725 --> 29:03.724
Guilty!

29:03.725 --> 29:07.724
Fuck 'em.

29:14.005 --> 29:15.724
Who is he?

29:15.725 --> 29:19.724
He must be the guy with the case.

29:20.245 --> 29:23.324
Jesus, get it off me! You just
touched me face with his stump!

29:23.325 --> 29:25.884
Don't be such a baby.
It was an accident.

29:25.885 --> 29:27.604
It touched me mouth.

29:27.605 --> 29:31.204
That's how people get AIDs.

29:31.205 --> 29:33.604
Yeah, there's other ways too.

29:33.605 --> 29:35.924
Like sharing needles
and fucking monkeys.

29:35.925 --> 29:39.924
Who are you?

29:42.725 --> 29:46.724
We're on Community Service.

29:46.965 --> 29:48.004
Where's my case?

29:48.005 --> 29:50.804
We don't know anything
about your briefcase.

29:50.805 --> 29:52.564
We show up here this morning, mm?

29:52.565 --> 29:55.244
This guy pretends to be
our probation worker.

29:55.245 --> 29:59.244
He tells us this crazy story, then he
drugs us and locks us in a freezer.

30:00.205 --> 30:02.524
So why don't you tell us
what the fuck is going on?

30:02.525 --> 30:06.524
You can entertain us
while we all slowly freeze to death.

30:12.205 --> 30:15.484
Before all this shit started,

30:15.485 --> 30:18.244
me and the guys I used to run with,

30:18.245 --> 30:21.124
we just robbed a case full of cash
from some diamond dealer.

30:21.125 --> 30:25.124
We were just about to divvy up
the cash.

30:25.645 --> 30:28.004
'I'm sitting there
and I'm looking at the money,

30:28.005 --> 30:31.044
'and I just know
I don't want to share it.

30:31.045 --> 30:33.124
'You move in that world long enough,

30:33.125 --> 30:36.004
'it gets so you don't care
who you screw over.'

30:36.005 --> 30:40.004
♪ Finished with my woman
cos she couldn't help me with my mind

30:41.765 --> 30:45.764
♪ People think I'm insane because
I am frowning all the time... ♪

30:50.685 --> 30:54.684
'Next thing I know is
I'm lying on the ground.

30:54.885 --> 30:56.284
'Ever since then,

30:56.285 --> 30:59.484
'people have been trying
to take the money off me.

30:59.485 --> 31:01.244
'People go crazy.'

31:13.645 --> 31:16.524
It's like...

31:16.525 --> 31:20.524
I infected them.

31:21.045 --> 31:23.684
I lost...

31:23.685 --> 31:27.684
everyone I ever cared about.

31:32.685 --> 31:35.684
So I wonder where the case is?

31:35.685 --> 31:37.404
Why're you suddenly so interested?

31:37.405 --> 31:38.564
Are you infected?

31:38.565 --> 31:40.204
No. What about you?

31:40.205 --> 31:44.204
Look at him. He's dying and frozen.

31:44.645 --> 31:48.484
It's obviously not working any more.

31:48.485 --> 31:52.484
Obviously.

31:53.605 --> 31:57.604
So via a scientific process
of elimination,

31:57.885 --> 32:01.404
I have established that Curtis,

32:01.405 --> 32:05.404
he must have that case.

32:05.965 --> 32:08.964
But we've got the guy
who knows the combination.

32:08.965 --> 32:12.964
Checkmate.

32:13.165 --> 32:14.604
Stalemate?

32:14.605 --> 32:17.364
Well, that's the same difference,
isn't it? Really?

32:17.365 --> 32:21.364
So what do you say me and you team
up, kill Curtis, split the cash?

32:22.285 --> 32:25.044
Curtis is a dick. You?

32:25.045 --> 32:26.084
You're different.

32:26.085 --> 32:29.124
I've always admired
and respected you.

32:29.125 --> 32:31.684
Am I shocked?

32:31.685 --> 32:35.444
Not really.

32:35.445 --> 32:37.764
Dude, do you...

32:37.765 --> 32:40.084
Do you think my cock looks like
a tiny little slug?

32:43.765 --> 32:46.084
I think you have
a fucking beautiful penis.

32:46.085 --> 32:47.844
Thanks, mate.

32:47.845 --> 32:49.604
I am strangely blessed.

32:49.605 --> 32:52.084
D'you know what, I like you.

32:52.085 --> 32:54.164
I like you a lot.

32:54.165 --> 32:55.244
We should be best mates.

32:55.245 --> 32:59.244
We are we are so in tune,
it's scary.

32:59.565 --> 33:03.564
We're like one cock with two minds.

33:03.645 --> 33:05.964
I love you, man.

33:05.965 --> 33:09.004
Welling up a bit there.

33:09.005 --> 33:11.924
I love you too.

33:11.925 --> 33:15.924
Do you want to hug it out
or summat?

33:16.125 --> 33:20.124
Yeah. Banging.

33:27.525 --> 33:30.444
This is...

33:30.445 --> 33:33.364
I'm loving this.

33:33.365 --> 33:36.764
Me too.

33:36.765 --> 33:40.764
It is a bit awkward cos
you were quite complimentary

33:40.965 --> 33:44.844
about my penis back there
and you should probably know...

33:44.845 --> 33:46.764
that I've spiked your drink.

33:46.765 --> 33:50.764
And you should also know...

33:51.645 --> 33:55.644
that I didn't drink it.

34:10.364 --> 34:12.924
What in the name of Jesus
have you got yourself

34:12.925 --> 34:13.964
mixed up in this time?

34:13.965 --> 34:17.964
You've just been knocked unconscious
with an 'ole punch.

34:26.445 --> 34:29.004
When we get out of this freezer,

34:29.005 --> 34:31.924
we should team up, kill those fuckers

34:31.925 --> 34:34.364
and take the case.

34:34.364 --> 34:37.364
Definitely.

34:40.565 --> 34:44.563
Let's do this.

34:47.364 --> 34:48.484
Hiya.

34:50.324 --> 34:52.204
I'm here to rescue you.

34:52.205 --> 34:55.364
Rescue us?! We nearly died in there,
you dick! Kick him again.

34:55.364 --> 34:57.604
Wait, wait!

34:57.605 --> 34:59.524
I am not the guy
who locked you in the freezer.

34:59.525 --> 35:03.524
Come on. Even I don't believe that,
and I can be incredibly naive.

35:03.725 --> 35:06.004
It was the other me.

35:06.005 --> 35:08.484
Yeah. He's like my twin...

35:08.485 --> 35:10.004
sort of.

35:10.005 --> 35:11.884
It was the storm.

35:11.885 --> 35:15.884
You know about the storm, don't you?

35:17.885 --> 35:18.924
Maybe.

35:18.925 --> 35:22.644
OK. If you're not the guy that
locked us in the freezer, prove it.

35:22.645 --> 35:26.644
I know where the briefcase is.

35:31.765 --> 35:33.324
She pissed in her pants.

35:33.325 --> 35:34.509
Mm-hm.

35:38.709 --> 35:41.828
I wasn't even here yesterday.
I was cleaning our flat.

35:41.894 --> 35:44.133
Well the other Rudy's not going
to do it, is he?

35:44.134 --> 35:48.133
And then, when he didn't come back,
that's when I went looking for him.

35:53.374 --> 35:54.413
Please...

36:05.854 --> 36:07.213
Bingo!

36:09.174 --> 36:10.213
Oh...

36:54.054 --> 36:58.053
So, since then,
I've been watching them,

36:58.294 --> 37:01.133
just trying to work out
what the hell's been going on.

37:01.134 --> 37:03.973
It's the guy in the freezer.
He's infected them.

37:03.974 --> 37:06.853
They'll do anything to get their
hands on the money in the case.

37:06.854 --> 37:08.653
How do we stop it? I don't know.

37:08.654 --> 37:12.653
Maybe you have to kill
the guy in the freezer.

37:13.254 --> 37:17.253
You were in the freezer with him.

37:19.715 --> 37:20.754
We're OK.

37:20.828 --> 37:22.806
Because he was dying?
And frozen.

37:22.447 --> 37:27.526
Which cancels the whole thing out?
Obviously.

37:31.767 --> 37:34.006
I'm taking the case.
Don't make me hurt you.

37:34.007 --> 37:38.006
Oh, yeah? You think you're the only
one with a power around here?

38:07.207 --> 38:11.206
Shit.

38:16.287 --> 38:19.126
I think you've got something
that belongs to me.

38:19.127 --> 38:21.086
I am taking that case.

38:21.087 --> 38:23.486
The man with the bloody big
chainsaw begs to differ.

38:23.487 --> 38:25.486
You dirty little...

38:25.487 --> 38:29.486
Give me that fucking case!

38:36.007 --> 38:38.006
Give me the motherfucking case!

38:38.007 --> 38:39.606
Back off! Stay back!

38:39.607 --> 38:41.726
Give me it. I swear
I'll cave your fucking skull in.

38:41.727 --> 38:44.526
I'm going to saw your
fucking legs off, you dick.

38:44.527 --> 38:45.886
Oh, shit! Me and you,

38:45.887 --> 38:49.886
we're friends. We bonded
like the end of Titanic, remember?
So come on, give me the case.

38:50.087 --> 38:52.086
Fuck the end of Titanic!

38:55.767 --> 38:59.766
Money!

39:37.807 --> 39:41.806
My money.

39:54.567 --> 39:57.166
That were intense, weren't it?

39:57.167 --> 39:59.126
What the fuck was all that about?

39:59.127 --> 40:01.166
It was the guy with the case.

40:01.167 --> 40:02.886
He infected us
with some kind of power.

40:02.887 --> 40:03.926
Oh.

40:03.927 --> 40:07.926
It's the storm. Always the storm.

40:12.447 --> 40:16.126
And what's your story?

40:16.127 --> 40:19.686
We're new.

40:19.687 --> 40:22.486
Ey, how about that, then?
That's quite a tale, that is.

40:22.487 --> 40:26.486
Took twists and turns, didn't it?
New powers.

40:27.087 --> 40:31.086
A hint of sexual possibilities.

40:32.807 --> 40:34.406
Tears,

40:34.407 --> 40:37.726
laughter, horribly graphic violence.

40:37.727 --> 40:40.686
Oh, mate, mutilated testicles!

40:40.687 --> 40:43.166
Yes, mm-mm-mm,

40:43.167 --> 40:47.166
something for all the family.

41:02.727 --> 41:06.726
Who are you?

41:08.007 --> 41:12.006
I'm your new probation worker.

41:12.767 --> 41:16.606
How do we know you're
not just someone

41:16.607 --> 41:18.526
impersonating a probation worker?

41:18.527 --> 41:21.686
Why would someone impersonate
a probation worker?

41:21.687 --> 41:24.566
Cor, I have no idea.

41:26.967 --> 41:30.966
I mean, I certainly never have
and never would, because...

41:32.127 --> 41:35.886
well, because I've got too much
respect for that badge.

41:35.887 --> 41:38.366
Is it OK if I leave early?

41:38.367 --> 41:42.366
I've got a dog at home.
I need to let her out for a shit.

41:52.407 --> 41:56.086
Er, have you heard the one

41:56.087 --> 41:59.966
about the guy who left
his community service early

41:59.967 --> 42:02.126
to let his dog out for a shit?

42:02.127 --> 42:04.086
No.

42:04.087 --> 42:07.366
And his probation worker...

42:07.367 --> 42:11.366
Go on.

42:12.007 --> 42:15.286
He hunted him down.

42:15.287 --> 42:18.926
He pinned him to the floor.

42:18.927 --> 42:22.926
And he fed him
the dog shit with a teaspoon.

42:23.727 --> 42:25.166
I'm sure she can wait.

42:25.167 --> 42:29.166
You cross me...

42:29.567 --> 42:33.566
and I will fuck you like
you have never been fucked before.

42:34.247 --> 42:38.246
You will feel like you have been
fucked by a train.

42:49.527 --> 42:53.526
I think we'll get along great.
And you...

42:55.087 --> 42:59.086
I really like you.

43:00.487 --> 43:04.486
Whatever.

43:07.487 --> 43:10.166
Are probation
workers always that fucking creepy?

43:10.167 --> 43:11.526
That's definitely new.

43:11.527 --> 43:14.726
Why did he single me out? Why me?

43:14.727 --> 43:16.406
Well, don't sweat it, man.

43:16.407 --> 43:20.406
Chances are he'll be dead
by t'end of week.

43:44.967 --> 43:48.966
Sadie? I'm home.

43:52.607 --> 43:55.086
You are not going to believe
the day I've had.

43:55.087 --> 43:57.646
It was totally insane.
I mean, off the scale.

43:57.647 --> 44:01.486
How was your day?

44:01.487 --> 44:03.166
Tell you what,

44:03.167 --> 44:05.726
why don't I make us a sandwich,

44:05.727 --> 44:09.726
then I'll tell you all about it?

44:09.807 --> 44:13.286
This is a sculpting class,
and you will be their models.

44:13.287 --> 44:16.406
They might not be able to see you,
but I can.

44:16.407 --> 44:18.926
I'm supposed to feel your face.
Go for it.

44:18.927 --> 44:21.166
'Trying to get your stinking
little fingers'

44:21.167 --> 44:22.966
into her lovely creamy knickers.

44:22.967 --> 44:24.486
There ain't no law against shagging
beautiful blind girls.

44:24.487 --> 44:25.566
There is a law!

44:25.567 --> 44:27.686
'There's a law.
It's called Rudy's law.

44:27.687 --> 44:30.006
'He's got this room,
he keeps it locked.

44:30.007 --> 44:33.726
'Keep hearing all this talking
through the door.'

44:33.727 --> 44:35.086
I like to shit in a bucket.

44:35.087 --> 44:36.366
Hello?

44:36.367 --> 44:40.366
I don't want to keep you like this
any longer than I have to.
