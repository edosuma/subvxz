WEBVTT

00:05.039 --> 00:06.874
So, you guys moved
out of this house,

00:06.974 --> 00:09.009
and now you want to move
back in?

00:09.110 --> 00:10.878
(clears throat)
Allow me to explain --

00:10.978 --> 00:11.945
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.

00:12.046 --> 00:14.582
Before you do,
um, how are the scones?

00:14.682 --> 00:17.085
-They're okay.
-Yeah, they taste pretty good.

00:17.185 --> 00:18.886
Good. Okay, go ahead.
Tell me your story.

00:18.986 --> 00:21.689
Well, to secure me a spot
at St. Orlando's...

00:21.789 --> 00:23.624
Mommy moved us
out of this house

00:23.724 --> 00:25.893
and into a bigger house
that we bought

00:25.993 --> 00:26.960
using the money
that my dad made

00:27.061 --> 00:29.263
selling part of his restaurant
to Michael Bolton.

00:29.363 --> 00:32.100
But when that house
was too fancy

00:32.200 --> 00:34.468
and Emery got my admission
to St. Orlando's revoked,

00:34.568 --> 00:37.071
we decided to move back here
to our old house.

00:37.171 --> 00:38.739
Good luck with high school,
losers!

00:38.839 --> 00:39.707
Also, Eddie was rude
to his friends

00:39.807 --> 00:41.275
so now he doesn't have
any friends.

00:41.375 --> 00:44.778
So anyway, that's why
we need you to move out.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.147
What do you need,
5, 10 minutes?

00:46.247 --> 00:49.317
You know what?
I've signed a lease here, so...

00:49.417 --> 00:50.651
my hands are kinda tied.

00:50.751 --> 00:52.886
Maybe you guys
could move into a hotel

00:52.986 --> 00:54.555
until you find
a new place.

00:55.989 --> 00:58.392
Welcome to Hotel Honey!
(laughs softly)

01:02.230 --> 01:03.831
Are you sure it's okay
to stay here?

01:03.931 --> 01:05.633
There's so many of us.

01:05.733 --> 01:08.302
Are you kidding?
Stay as long you like.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.171
My home is your home.

01:12.473 --> 01:15.976
(hair dryer blowing)

01:16.076 --> 01:18.579
Mr. Huang's been blow-drying
his hair for 45 minutes!

01:18.679 --> 01:21.982
You're a man! You always look
exactly the same!

01:22.082 --> 01:23.517
(pounding on bathroom door,
TV chatter)

01:23.617 --> 01:25.353
Good morning!

01:25.453 --> 01:27.321
Hey, I didn't know you had
the Game Show Channel --

01:27.421 --> 01:29.123
It's "Cincinnati,"
you idiot!

01:29.223 --> 01:33.961
Wow, you all really
made yourselves at home...

01:34.061 --> 01:35.863
overnight.

01:35.963 --> 01:39.099
(grunts) You have
really strong doorjambs.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.301
Thank you.

01:40.401 --> 01:43.604
Don't buy a vowel
Come on!

01:43.704 --> 01:45.473
You're out of cereal.

01:46.974 --> 01:49.277
**

01:49.377 --> 01:50.478
* Fresh off the boat

01:50.578 --> 01:52.180
* I'm gettin' mine
everywhere I go *

01:52.280 --> 01:54.482
* If you don't know, homey,
now you know *

01:54.582 --> 01:56.150
* Fresh off the boat

01:56.250 --> 01:58.152
* Homey, you don't know
where I come from *

01:58.252 --> 01:59.520
* But I know where I'm goin'

01:59.620 --> 02:02.223
* I'm fresh off the boat

02:05.826 --> 02:07.628
Thou damned whale.

02:07.728 --> 02:08.962
(chuckles)

02:09.062 --> 02:11.299
St. Orlando's might have
taken away my admission,

02:11.399 --> 02:14.001
but they can't take away
their summer reading list.

02:16.069 --> 02:18.639
If you want to read something
a little more fun,

02:18.739 --> 02:21.575
we have plenty of Nicole's
old books on the shelf.

02:24.578 --> 02:26.714
I'm sorry,
where are your books?

02:26.814 --> 02:28.249
Behind this trash?

02:28.349 --> 02:31.419
(scoffs)
Logan Likes Mary Anne.

02:31.519 --> 02:33.521
So?

02:33.621 --> 02:35.189
(book thuds)

02:35.289 --> 02:36.524
LOUIS: Honey!
Good news.

02:36.624 --> 02:39.092
We just got off the phone
with our old landlord, Murray,

02:39.193 --> 02:41.929
and he says he's open
to selling us our house back.

02:42.029 --> 02:46.834
Oh. So soon?
Aw, boo, but you just got here.

02:46.934 --> 02:48.736
I'm going over there later today
to do a walk-through.

02:48.836 --> 02:49.737
Do you want to join me?

02:49.837 --> 02:51.605
You could hold my purse
while I negotiate.

02:51.705 --> 02:54.242
Absolutely.
Anything to help.

02:54.342 --> 02:55.443
(door opens)

02:55.543 --> 02:58.178
Well, if it isn't
Emery "The Tool Man" Huang.

02:58.279 --> 02:59.380
(as Tim Allen)
Ho-ho-ho-ho!

02:59.480 --> 03:01.582
(both chuckle)
That's good.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.617
I'm building a new birdhouse
for Marvin and Honey.

03:03.717 --> 03:06.454
You know, your old man
knows his way around a lathe.

03:06.554 --> 03:09.122
I once flirted with the idea
of going into construction.

03:09.223 --> 03:10.724
Had a name picked out
and everything --

03:10.824 --> 03:12.593
Huang Construction.

03:12.693 --> 03:13.627
Do you want to help?

03:13.727 --> 03:15.229
It'd be fun to work on it
together.

03:15.329 --> 03:18.031
(pager beeping)
Oh.

03:18.131 --> 03:20.701
Hmm. I wish I could,
but I got to go to work.

03:20.801 --> 03:21.802
Duty calls.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.637
Oh.
Okay.

03:23.737 --> 03:25.573
No problem.
Have fun.

03:25.673 --> 03:29.710
(door opens, closes)

03:29.810 --> 03:31.745
Oh!
Hey, Nicole.

03:31.845 --> 03:34.114
Um...
I like your towel.

03:34.214 --> 03:37.318
Thanks. It's, uh,
Pumbaa from The Lion King.

03:37.418 --> 03:38.919
Uh...

03:39.019 --> 03:40.954
Well, I should
go get ready.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.656
Um, I'm driving
some of my friends to the mall

03:42.756 --> 03:44.224
to go see
that movie Contact.

03:44.325 --> 03:46.126
You have a car?
Yep.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.228
My dad got me a Saturn
for not getting held back again.

03:48.329 --> 03:49.430
It's a "you're progressing

03:49.530 --> 03:51.499
at the pace you should be
moving at" present.

03:51.599 --> 03:53.567
You set the bar low.
Dope.

03:53.667 --> 03:56.737
My boo Alison's at band camp all
summer on that woodwind tip.

03:56.837 --> 04:00.007
So I guess I'll just hang with
the fellas, see what's good.

04:00.107 --> 04:03.110
(metal scraping)

04:06.414 --> 04:09.283
Hey, guys, what's up?
You guys catch the ER finale?

04:09.383 --> 04:12.586
Uh, what are you doing?
What do you mean?

04:12.686 --> 04:14.288
You called us losers,
remember?

04:14.388 --> 04:15.423
You're still mad
about that?

04:15.523 --> 04:16.657
That was weeks ago.

04:16.757 --> 04:19.593
Can you fools believe Dr. Ross
kissed Nurse Hathaway?

04:19.693 --> 04:20.828
Twist!

04:20.928 --> 04:22.830
To be fair, their chemistry's
been steadily building

04:22.930 --> 04:23.831
since season one --

04:23.931 --> 04:25.966
Brian.

04:27.167 --> 04:30.003
(sighs)
You know what? Fine.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.039
I don't need you guys.

04:35.309 --> 04:38.812
The ER finale
made me cry.

04:38.912 --> 04:42.015
(indistinct conversations)

04:42.115 --> 04:43.317
Hmm.

04:43.417 --> 04:44.718
He knows!

04:44.818 --> 04:46.019
Who knows?
About what?

04:46.119 --> 04:48.456
Kenny Rogers knows
about our success.

04:48.556 --> 04:49.890
I sent him
a summer update

04:49.990 --> 04:51.892
on company letterhead.

04:51.992 --> 04:55.062
"My new business venture
is going great.

04:55.162 --> 04:56.997
Yeah, we're successful,
all right.

04:57.097 --> 04:58.298
So successful
that I'm sure

04:58.399 --> 05:00.501
we'll expand Michael Bolton's
Cattleman's Ranch

05:00.601 --> 05:03.036
both domestically
and abroad.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.072
Who knows, maybe we'll even
put one on the moon.

05:05.172 --> 05:08.241
Ha ha.
Your friend, Michael Bolton."

05:08.342 --> 05:09.510
(screams)

05:09.610 --> 05:12.580
I'm so baaaaad.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.715
Right.
Um, I should get to work.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.584
No, you should
take some time off,

05:16.684 --> 05:18.185
spend some time
with your family.

05:18.285 --> 05:19.520
Ah, that's very nice,
Michael,

05:19.620 --> 05:20.821
but I couldn't do that
to you.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.990
Nonsense.
We're partners.

05:23.090 --> 05:25.826
When Grammy season rolls around,
I'll rely on you.

05:25.926 --> 05:27.260
Until then...

05:27.361 --> 05:30.097
* Lean on me

05:30.197 --> 05:32.700
(applause)

05:34.835 --> 05:36.069
Huh.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.070
Are you sure?

05:37.170 --> 05:39.239
Go.
I'll take care of things here...

05:39.339 --> 05:40.374
(southern accent)
partner.

05:43.411 --> 05:46.414
And finally,
here's the kitchen.

05:46.514 --> 05:48.682
Which of course you already know
'cause you used to live here.

05:48.782 --> 05:51.685
-Mm-hmm.
-Sorry about this.

05:51.785 --> 05:53.454
I know you just moved in.
Oh, that's okay.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.589
This kind of thing
happens to me constantly.

05:55.689 --> 05:58.225
Whenever I hang my hat,
somebody takes away the hook.

05:58.325 --> 05:59.960
Did you just come up
with that?

06:00.060 --> 06:02.596
Well,
I used to design mugs.

06:02.696 --> 06:03.564
Oh.

06:03.664 --> 06:05.599
Okay, if that's everything,

06:05.699 --> 06:06.967
I'll start drawing up
the paperwork.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.569
JESSICA: Not so fast.

06:08.669 --> 06:13.641
**

06:13.741 --> 06:16.544
Loose knob!
When were you going to tell me?

06:16.644 --> 06:20.047
Um, also the, uh,
dishwasher doesn't work.

06:20.147 --> 06:22.115
I think somebody
disconnected it.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.985
Slumlord!

06:25.085 --> 06:27.287
I'm afraid there's just
too much undisclosed damage

06:27.387 --> 06:29.490
for me to move forward
at the current price.

06:29.590 --> 06:31.559
But your family
caused the damage.

06:31.659 --> 06:32.826
Here come the mind games.

06:32.926 --> 06:34.227
Well, how do you know

06:34.327 --> 06:38.298
that it wasn't this
blond nightmare right here?

06:38.398 --> 06:39.900
Oh, hey,
that reminds me --

06:40.000 --> 06:42.302
I saved your mail
for you.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.171
Oh, thank you.

06:45.839 --> 06:48.576
TEEN GIRL (ethereal voice):
Evan.

06:48.676 --> 06:50.444
TEEN GIRL #2: Evan.

06:50.544 --> 06:52.012
Read us, Evan.

06:52.112 --> 06:53.847
We're light and fun.

06:53.947 --> 06:56.116
( laughter )

06:56.216 --> 06:57.651
Read us.

06:57.751 --> 07:00.287
TEEN GIRLS:
You know you want to.

07:00.387 --> 07:01.321
(door opens)

07:02.623 --> 07:04.692
I just don't understand why you
would sabotage your own sale.

07:04.792 --> 07:08.161
Relax. Acting disinterested
was just a tactic.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.663
He's gonna sleep on it
tonight,

07:09.763 --> 07:11.765
and then he'll come back
with a lower offer to --

07:11.865 --> 07:13.133
Oh, my God!

07:13.233 --> 07:15.836
I'm gonna be
on Wheel of Fortune!

07:15.936 --> 07:17.170
(inhales sharply)

07:17.270 --> 07:22.175
(both scream)

07:24.712 --> 07:30.283
(screaming)

07:30.383 --> 07:32.686
(inhales sharply)
What on Earth...

07:32.786 --> 07:34.488
EVAN: Mommy applied to be on
Wheel of Fortune

07:34.588 --> 07:36.557
as soon as she became
a U.S. citizen.

07:36.657 --> 07:38.492
She started watching when
she was pregnant with Eddie.

07:38.592 --> 07:40.360
That's why all our names
start with "E."

07:40.460 --> 07:41.829
It's her favorite vowel.

07:41.929 --> 07:44.231
I was a contestant on Studs
once.

07:44.331 --> 07:47.234
"Wheel of Fortune is coming
to Orlando, Jessica Huang.

07:47.334 --> 07:49.637
We invite you
and your best friend

07:49.737 --> 07:53.373
to compete on our annual
'Best Friends Week.'"

07:53.473 --> 07:57.177
Honey, will you be my
best-friends partner?

07:57.277 --> 07:58.746
Sure.
It sounds fun.

07:58.846 --> 08:01.148
But back to
the house thing.

08:01.248 --> 08:03.216
If you're gonna make
that counter-offer tomorrow --

08:03.316 --> 08:04.918
They'll be plenty of time
for that after Wheel.

08:05.018 --> 08:07.555
Right now,
we need to practice.

08:09.857 --> 08:11.692
(exhales sharply)

08:11.792 --> 08:13.426
Are those
all your board games?

08:13.527 --> 08:14.862
Yes!

08:14.962 --> 08:16.396
Where'd my wedding dress
go?

08:16.496 --> 08:18.331
I rolled it up and I put it
inside the Monopoly.

08:18.431 --> 08:20.400
Your veil is inside
the Hungry Hungry Hippo.

08:25.072 --> 08:26.273
(slurps)

08:26.373 --> 08:28.008
(tires screech)

08:28.108 --> 08:30.678
Hey!
You want a ride home?

08:30.778 --> 08:33.013
(music playing on radio)
So, my friends met some boys
and ditched the movie.

08:33.113 --> 08:34.748
Apparently, guys
are more important

08:34.848 --> 08:36.550
than watching Jodie Foster
go to space.

08:36.650 --> 08:37.551
Uh-huh.

08:37.651 --> 08:40.120
Are you excited
to start high school?

08:40.220 --> 08:41.789
I guess.

08:41.889 --> 08:42.890
(music stops)

08:42.990 --> 08:44.524
Okay, spill it.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.126
You've said two words
since you've got in.

08:46.226 --> 08:47.260
What's up?

08:47.360 --> 08:48.862
It's nothing.
Forget it.

08:48.962 --> 08:51.732
Hey, whatever it is,
you can trust me.

08:51.832 --> 08:55.135
What we talk about in
the Saturn stays in the Saturn.

08:58.305 --> 09:01.742
See?
Safe space.

09:01.842 --> 09:03.476
My friends
aren't my friends anymore,

09:03.577 --> 09:05.545
and my girlfriend's gone
for the whole summer,

09:05.646 --> 09:07.080
and who knows what it's gonna be
like between us

09:07.180 --> 09:08.048
when she gets back.

09:08.148 --> 09:10.283
Now I have nobody,

09:10.383 --> 09:11.585
and I'm scared I'll have
to start high school alone.

09:11.685 --> 09:14.421
Maybe this is just the start of
something new for you.

09:14.521 --> 09:17.157
The hardest thing about figuring
out who you really are

09:17.257 --> 09:19.960
is letting go of
who you used to be, you know?

09:21.128 --> 09:23.731
Yeah,
that makes a lot of sense.

09:30.570 --> 09:33.306
It's cool to talk to somebody
who understands.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.909
Kinda like the...
(thinking)
Oh, my God.

09:36.009 --> 09:38.245
Did Nicole just put her hand
on my shoulder?

09:38.345 --> 09:40.648
She did!
Is is still there?

09:40.748 --> 09:41.649
Don't look, fool!

09:42.783 --> 09:45.118
Can we hang out again and talk,
just the two of us?

09:45.218 --> 09:47.420
W-We can go
to The Spicy Gecko.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.156
They don't charge
for chips.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.992
Did Nicole
just ask me out?

09:52.092 --> 09:53.460
But I have a girlfriend.

09:53.560 --> 09:56.930
I mean, I like Alison,
but Nicole's my first crush --

09:57.030 --> 09:57.998
(horn honks)

09:58.098 --> 10:01.769
Pull...in!!

10:05.673 --> 10:08.441
I think you guys
are gonna love your new house.

10:08.541 --> 10:10.477
Even you, Jeremy.
(Jeremy chirps)

10:10.577 --> 10:13.280
Hey, Dad, what are you doing
home so early?

10:13.380 --> 10:14.782
I'm taking a few days off.

10:14.882 --> 10:16.984
Thought we could build
that birdhouse together.

10:17.084 --> 10:19.820
Huang Construction...
and Son.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.822
That'd be awesome!
I could use the help.

10:21.922 --> 10:24.224
(pager beeping)

10:24.324 --> 10:26.226
It's okay
if you need to take it.

10:26.326 --> 10:27.695
I know you're busy.

10:27.795 --> 10:29.396
I am busy...

10:29.496 --> 10:31.231
building a birdhouse
with my son.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.669
(both chuckle)

10:41.541 --> 10:43.677
I'll solve.
"Birthday cake."

10:43.777 --> 10:46.980
(sighs)

10:47.080 --> 10:48.215
(sighs)

10:48.315 --> 10:49.850
Honey, get your head
in the game!

10:49.950 --> 10:51.018
What if they bring back

10:51.118 --> 10:52.820
returning best-friends
champions, Don and Lisa?

10:52.920 --> 10:55.088
What then?

10:55.188 --> 10:56.323
(gasps)

10:58.358 --> 11:00.393
What a crazy tree.

11:00.493 --> 11:03.864
Okay, reset.
We'll go again.

11:03.964 --> 11:07.701
Jessica, we have done nothing
but practice for an entire week.

11:07.801 --> 11:09.102
I'm exhausted.

11:09.202 --> 11:11.705
And my house is...
Are you wearing my shirt?

11:11.805 --> 11:13.573
Yes.
Your laundry's backed up.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.009
You know, it is very hard
sharing a space

11:16.109 --> 11:17.577
with a whole other family.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.747
Yeah, speaking of that,

11:19.847 --> 11:21.448
where are you
on the counter-offer?

11:21.548 --> 11:22.850
I mean, no rush.

11:22.950 --> 11:26.386
I love having you here, but have
you heard from Murray at all?

11:26.486 --> 11:28.722
Yes. I put in the offer
two days ago and he accepted

11:28.822 --> 11:30.724
because, like I said,
he is weak.

11:30.824 --> 11:33.126
So we're going to go over
the contract this afternoon,

11:33.226 --> 11:34.594
and we should be out of here
very soon.

11:34.694 --> 11:37.130
Ah-- Uh--
No!

11:37.230 --> 11:38.932
Not -- Not too soon,
I hope.

11:39.032 --> 11:42.035
Okay, let's go over
the Wheel plan again.

11:42.135 --> 11:44.905
Never buy a vowel because
they're a waste of money.

11:45.005 --> 11:46.206
If one of us wants to solve,

11:46.306 --> 11:48.776
squeeze the other person's arm
three times

11:48.876 --> 11:49.943
and then sound it out.

11:50.043 --> 11:52.312
Sound it out because
when I hear you talking,

11:52.412 --> 11:54.414
it might spark something
for me.

11:54.514 --> 11:57.985
Keep up the chatter --
How about
we take the night off?

11:58.085 --> 11:59.419
I haven't seen Marvin
all week

11:59.519 --> 12:01.889
and I would love some private
time, just me and him.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.424
"Private time"?

12:04.524 --> 12:06.259
She can't wait
until after Wheel

12:06.359 --> 12:07.795
to have dinner
with her husband?

12:07.895 --> 12:10.463
Well, not everybody
has your work ethic.
(sighs)

12:10.563 --> 12:11.832
Speaking of,
Emery and I

12:11.932 --> 12:13.666
bought all the lumber
for the birdhouse.

12:13.767 --> 12:15.302
Construction
starts tomorrow.

12:15.402 --> 12:16.970
Uh-huh. I don't know
where Honey's head is at,

12:17.070 --> 12:18.405
but it's not on the wheel.

12:18.505 --> 12:21.942
Yesterday, she tried
to buy a number, Louis.

12:22.042 --> 12:24.111
A number.

12:24.211 --> 12:26.947
I just hope
she gets her head in the game.

12:29.182 --> 12:30.517
Good night.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.289
More wine, sweet pea?

12:40.160 --> 12:43.997
**

12:44.097 --> 12:48.001
The wheel looks so much smaller
in real life.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.169
Are you trembling?

12:49.269 --> 12:51.438
That's what happens
when you touch your dreams.

12:51.538 --> 12:52.672
(inhales sharply)

12:52.772 --> 12:54.875
Thanks for bringing me.

12:54.975 --> 12:56.609
I'm gonna miss you
when you move out.

12:56.709 --> 12:58.812
Oh, I didn't tell you?
That's not happening anymore.

12:58.912 --> 13:01.949
Murray wouldn't agree to
repaint, so I withdrew my offer.

13:02.049 --> 13:04.284
I told him, "I have all the time
in the world."

13:04.384 --> 13:06.954
We could just stay with you
for as long as it takes.

13:07.054 --> 13:08.856
(bell rings)

13:08.956 --> 13:11.524
JESSICA AND AUDIENCE:
Wheel...of...

13:11.624 --> 13:13.493
...Fortune!
...Fortune!

13:13.593 --> 13:16.129
(cheers and applause)

13:16.229 --> 13:18.465
(screams)

13:18.565 --> 13:19.699
Yes!

13:22.836 --> 13:23.837
-An N.
-Yes, three N's.

13:23.937 --> 13:24.905
-(screams)
-There you go.

13:25.005 --> 13:26.373
Yes!

13:26.473 --> 13:28.208
Yeah!

13:29.877 --> 13:31.211
Oh, no!

13:31.311 --> 13:32.312
(exhales sharply)

13:32.412 --> 13:34.081
I thought it was going
to land on Bankrupt,

13:34.181 --> 13:36.483
but it landed
on the one after Bankrupt!

13:36.583 --> 13:38.085
(exhales sharply)

13:38.185 --> 13:41.554
Dentist...
dent...wash...

13:41.654 --> 13:43.991
"Denzel Washington D.C.!"

13:44.091 --> 13:45.725
You got it!
That's it!

13:45.825 --> 13:47.427
(screams)

13:47.527 --> 13:48.996
Okay, let's uh, find out
a little bit more

13:49.096 --> 13:50.097
about our contestants.

13:50.197 --> 13:52.432
Jessica, it says here
you're a horror novelist

13:52.532 --> 13:53.566
and a real-estate mogul.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.903
I don't know
which one of those is scarier.

13:56.003 --> 13:58.238
(laughter)
Pat!

13:58.338 --> 13:59.940
And, uh,
Honey is your best friend

14:00.040 --> 14:01.441
and your business partner.

14:01.541 --> 14:03.743
Honey, what's it like working
with your best friend?

14:03.843 --> 14:05.845
Awful, Pat.
(laughter)

14:05.946 --> 14:08.115
Well, working with friends
can be hard.

14:08.215 --> 14:10.884
Especially when they start
stealing your yogurts

14:10.984 --> 14:12.685
from the work fridge.

14:12.785 --> 14:15.122
(gritting teeth)
If I see an unmarked Yoplait,

14:15.222 --> 14:17.124
I'm eating it!

14:17.224 --> 14:19.359
Let's move on
to round two.

14:20.961 --> 14:22.029
Hey, Dave.

14:22.129 --> 14:25.032
You can't be here, Eddie.
We're not friends anymore.

14:25.132 --> 14:28.902
I know, but I need some advice,
and I have nowhere else to turn.

14:29.002 --> 14:31.804
What do you do
if two girls like you?

14:31.905 --> 14:33.206
I don't understand
the question.

14:33.306 --> 14:35.408
I mean, what do you do
if you have a girlfriend,

14:35.508 --> 14:37.210
but then this other girl
who's really cool

14:37.310 --> 14:39.212
asks you to go eat chips
at The Spicy Gecko?

14:39.312 --> 14:40.480
The Spicy Gecko?

14:40.580 --> 14:42.649
That's the darkest
Mexican restaurant in town.

14:42.749 --> 14:44.117
The only reason
anyone goes there

14:44.217 --> 14:45.818
is to have
complete privacy.

14:45.919 --> 14:47.820
What do I do?
(snaps fingers)

14:47.921 --> 14:50.123
You should send yourself
flowers.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.124
How does that help?

14:51.224 --> 14:52.459
I don't know.

14:52.559 --> 14:53.826
But my mom does it a lot.

14:54.962 --> 14:56.964
LOUIS: ...and if we put
the wishing well here,

14:57.064 --> 14:58.265
that frees up room for...

14:58.365 --> 15:00.300
The hedge maze!
I knew you'd get it.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.169
All that's left now
is to break ground.

15:02.269 --> 15:03.303
You ready, son?

15:03.403 --> 15:04.671
Is The Secret World
of Alex Mack

15:04.771 --> 15:06.339
the best show
on television?

15:07.407 --> 15:08.641
It is.
I'm ready, Dad.

15:08.741 --> 15:12.612
(chuckles)
* Don't sweat the technique

15:12.712 --> 15:14.647
* Let's trace the hits
and check the file *

15:14.747 --> 15:16.783
* Let see who bit
to detect the style *

15:16.883 --> 15:19.286
* I flip the script
so they can't get foul *

15:19.386 --> 15:21.488
* At least not now,
it'll take a while *

15:21.588 --> 15:24.124
* I change the pace
to complete the beat *

15:24.224 --> 15:26.626
* Cause when I speak, they freak
to sweat the technique *

15:26.726 --> 15:27.827
(echoing)
* The technique

15:27.927 --> 15:29.997
(birdhouse creaking)

15:30.097 --> 15:32.132
(ominous music plays)
It looks...

15:32.232 --> 15:34.334
less welcoming
than in the drawing.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.336
Why is it making
that weird creaking sound?

15:36.436 --> 15:38.171
(creaking continues)

15:38.271 --> 15:40.807
Oh, it's, uh, probably
just the floorboards settling.

15:40.907 --> 15:43.176
Heh.
That's...normal.

15:43.276 --> 15:46.713
(doorbell rings eerily)
Oh, uh, neat.

15:46.813 --> 15:48.681
You didn't tell me
you put in a doorbell.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.117
(hushed voice)
I didn't.

15:50.217 --> 15:53.186
**

15:53.286 --> 15:56.323
(chips crunching)

15:56.423 --> 15:59.059
Good free chips.

15:59.159 --> 16:01.294
Yeah.
Crunchy.

16:04.064 --> 16:05.532
I'm glad we're doing this.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.900
Right.
Me too.

16:08.001 --> 16:10.503
There's something
I want to tell you,

16:10.603 --> 16:12.805
but I don't want to
make things weird between us,

16:12.905 --> 16:14.674
because I feel so comfortable
around you and --

16:14.774 --> 16:17.044
Nicole.
I think you're awesome.

16:17.144 --> 16:19.712
Any guy would be lucky to have
you as his girlfriend.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.814
But I already have one --

16:21.914 --> 16:24.817
Alison --
and she's great.

16:24.917 --> 16:28.721
I'm sorry,
but my answer is no.

16:28.821 --> 16:32.025
I think
I might like girls.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.265
(chip crunches)

16:51.511 --> 16:54.347
I'm sorry
if I made things weird.

16:54.447 --> 16:57.950
I've never told anybody that
before.

16:58.051 --> 17:01.521
And it feels really strange
saying it out loud.

17:01.621 --> 17:02.922
Uh-huh.
Right.

17:03.022 --> 17:06.559
But you're my friend,
and you're easy to talk to,

17:06.659 --> 17:09.429
so I thought you would
understand, you know?
Yep.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.731
Please don't tell anybody
yet.

17:11.831 --> 17:13.600
I'm still
trying to figure stuff out.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.102
Yeah, okay.

17:21.941 --> 17:23.610
(sighs)

17:23.710 --> 17:28.381
**

17:28.481 --> 17:30.650
Uh, Eddie,
what are you doing?

17:30.750 --> 17:35.054
What we talk about in the Saturn
stays in the Saturn, remember?

17:35.155 --> 17:38.125
Which is good because
I have so many questions.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.795
So when did you,
like, turn gay?

17:42.895 --> 17:45.165
Well, you don't "turn."

17:45.265 --> 17:46.166
I'm not a werewolf.

17:46.266 --> 17:48.268
Interesting.

17:48.368 --> 17:50.470
So does this change what kind of
jeans you're gonna wear?

17:50.570 --> 17:51.971
Uh (laughing) no.

17:52.071 --> 17:52.939
T!

17:53.039 --> 17:56.109
No, there's no T.
I'm sorry.

17:56.209 --> 17:57.177
Honey and Jessica?

17:57.277 --> 17:59.312
We'd like to buy an O!

17:59.412 --> 18:01.248
As in
"Overstaying Your Welcome."

18:01.348 --> 18:03.082
Honey, we said no buying vowels.
They're a waste of money --

18:03.183 --> 18:05.352
There are 11 O's!

18:05.452 --> 18:07.254
(cheers and applause)

18:07.354 --> 18:09.356
That's the hardest Vanna
will work in her life.

18:09.456 --> 18:10.923
(gritting teeth)
Ignore him, Vanna.

18:11.023 --> 18:12.525
Just do your job.

18:15.262 --> 18:18.765
"Oo Oo Oo
I wanna be like You Oo Oo!"

18:18.865 --> 18:20.367
That's it!
You got it!

18:20.467 --> 18:25.004
And you win a two-week
best-friends cruise

18:25.104 --> 18:26.473
to beautiful Cozumel!
Yes!

18:26.573 --> 18:28.341
Yes!
More time together!

18:28.441 --> 18:31.010
Honey, you can hold my purse
while I snorkel!

18:31.110 --> 18:33.713
You know what?
No. That's it.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.782
That's it.
I'm done, Jessica.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.984
First,
you move your family in

18:38.084 --> 18:39.352
and you take over
my entire house,

18:39.452 --> 18:41.888
and then instead of looking
for a permanent place to live,

18:41.988 --> 18:43.990
you take advantage
of my hospitality

18:44.090 --> 18:45.992
and you spend
all of your time practicing

18:46.092 --> 18:47.026
for this stupid game show.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.296
And not once
did you say "thank you."

18:49.396 --> 18:51.864
(audience oohs)

18:51.964 --> 18:54.534
You said,
"Stay as long as you like."

18:54.634 --> 18:57.136
If you wanted us to leave,
why didn't you just tell me?

18:57.237 --> 18:59.038
Because I'm Southern.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.874
We're built on hospitality
and charm.

19:01.974 --> 19:05.412
We say things like,
"Aww, what a cute baby,"

19:05.512 --> 19:07.480
and, "Your wedding
was beautiful,"

19:07.580 --> 19:08.881
but we don't mean it.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.517
We're very nice liars.

19:10.617 --> 19:11.751
And you're supposed
to know that.

19:11.851 --> 19:13.886
It's
an unspoken understanding.

19:15.222 --> 19:17.990
Honey, I shouldn't have invited
you on this show.

19:18.090 --> 19:19.592
You're not my best friend.

19:19.692 --> 19:20.927
(audience gasps)

19:21.027 --> 19:22.562
You're my family.

19:23.830 --> 19:26.499
And where I come from,
it is an unspoken understanding

19:26.599 --> 19:28.768
that you don't say thank you
to your family

19:28.868 --> 19:30.370
because you don't need to.

19:30.470 --> 19:33.440
You know they'll always
have your back

19:33.540 --> 19:36.409
no matter how hard
things get.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.578
And you will always
have theirs.

19:38.678 --> 19:41.414
I think of you
like family, too.

19:41.514 --> 19:44.617
Extended family who you love
but don't want to live with.

19:44.717 --> 19:47.720
I'll call Murray back tonight,
and I will accept his offer.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.856
What about him refusing
to repaint the house?

19:49.956 --> 19:51.924
(voice breaking)
I'll make Eddie do it.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.793
(audience awws)

19:53.926 --> 19:56.062
(cheers and applause)

19:59.266 --> 20:01.067
I'm sorry
we ruined Best Friends Week.

20:01.167 --> 20:04.904
Real best friends fight
because they care.

20:05.004 --> 20:07.407
Sometimes you're hardest
on the people

20:07.507 --> 20:10.310
who...who matter to you
the most.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.412
(exhales sharply)
Ding.

20:12.512 --> 20:15.648
(voice breaking)
There's only one U.

20:15.748 --> 20:16.949
(cheers and applause)

20:19.419 --> 20:22.655
Well, thank you
for letting us stay.
You're welcome any time.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.391
Southern, right?

20:24.491 --> 20:26.893
Mm-hmm.
(laughs)

20:31.898 --> 20:35.101
Well...nothing I can say.

20:37.604 --> 20:39.806
Uh, what is that?

20:39.906 --> 20:41.574
EMERY: It's a bird deck.

20:41.674 --> 20:42.975
A not-haunted bird deck.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.411
Trust us.
It's better this way.

20:44.511 --> 20:45.945
(engine revving)

20:46.045 --> 20:47.480
(tires screech, door slams)

20:47.580 --> 20:50.650
Louis! Where you been?
I've been paging you all week!

20:50.750 --> 20:53.119
What's going on?
We have an emergency.

20:53.219 --> 20:58.090
Kenny Rogers' Michael Bolton's
Cattleman's Ranch?

20:58.190 --> 20:59.125
Uh...

20:59.225 --> 21:01.294
Michael!
What happened?

21:01.394 --> 21:02.962
Kenny's a jealous man,
Louis.

21:03.062 --> 21:05.665
An extremely wealthy,
jealous man.

21:05.765 --> 21:08.368
He offered me
a ridiculous amount of money

21:08.468 --> 21:09.836
for my half
of the restaurant.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.203
But you said
I could lean on you!

21:11.304 --> 21:12.305
You sang it!

21:12.405 --> 21:14.006
I'll never forget you,
Louis.

21:14.106 --> 21:15.875
And we did have
some great times, didn't we?

21:15.975 --> 21:17.677
Did we?

21:20.380 --> 21:24.317
(Louis sighs)
Looks like
The Gambler always wins.

21:24.417 --> 21:26.486
