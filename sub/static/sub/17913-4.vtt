WEBVTT

00:11.880 --> 00:13.720
So how does this work?
Should I just...

00:13.800 --> 00:15.760
should I pop my trousers
on the back of the chair?

00:15.840 --> 00:17.840
There's gonna be one ground rule with you.

00:17.920 --> 00:21.200
I know we used to date,
but there's to be no hitting on me

00:21.280 --> 00:24.440
when you're trying to
avoid feelings of discomfort.

00:24.520 --> 00:26.640
So, when you called me,

00:26.720 --> 00:29.720
you said there was a girl
whose death had affected you.

00:30.320 --> 00:31.480
Okay.

00:33.400 --> 00:34.600
Truth missile...

00:34.680 --> 00:37.320
I came because it was a good way
to see you again.

00:37.400 --> 00:38.600
Ideally, naked.

00:38.680 --> 00:41.120
No. That was easy.

00:41.200 --> 00:43.560
I can charge you for that
and then we can call it a day

00:43.640 --> 00:45.480
now that you've got your answer, right?

00:48.960 --> 00:50.720
Perfect.

00:50.800 --> 00:51.800
Good.

00:53.600 --> 00:54.800
Luke...

00:54.880 --> 00:59.200
I'm actually all right at my job,
if you wanted to use the rest of the time.

01:03.960 --> 01:06.240
[sighs heavily]
I am going to hate this.

01:06.320 --> 01:08.640
- You don't have to be here.
- No, no.

01:08.720 --> 01:11.840
I do, I... I need to be here, but...

01:13.800 --> 01:15.680
I am going to hate it.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.074

01:25.640 --> 01:27.160
[doorbell rings]

01:28.040 --> 01:30.440
- Hi. I take it you're the other half.
- I, uh...

01:30.520 --> 01:33.120
He's my other quarter.
Half would be a lot of pressure.

01:33.200 --> 01:34.560
[chuckles]

01:35.160 --> 01:37.480
Thanks for coming.
I needed a second opinion.

01:37.560 --> 01:39.560
Any questions, I'll be outside.

01:41.680 --> 01:42.920
How was your day?

01:43.000 --> 01:47.240
- I've been cutting down trees.
- Why? For your job?

01:47.320 --> 01:49.920
Have you told me this already?
[chuckles] You have.

01:52.600 --> 01:55.160
Garden design.
I tell people where to put plants.

01:55.720 --> 01:56.800
That's the one.

01:56.880 --> 01:58.840
- [cell phone chimes]
- [Dylan inhales]

02:00.200 --> 02:01.320
[chuckling] Oh, funny.

02:01.400 --> 02:03.520
- What?
- It's a girl I used to know.

02:03.600 --> 02:06.720
She's just texted one word. "No."

02:06.800 --> 02:09.560
I just told her she might wanna
get tested for, you know...

02:09.639 --> 02:13.120
She's one of the girls from your list.
I feel close to her already.

02:13.200 --> 02:15.040
- [both chuckle]
- So wait, was that "no"

02:15.120 --> 02:17.200
as in she's refusing to get tested?

02:17.280 --> 02:20.480
Or "no" that she's had the test already
and it came back negative?

02:20.560 --> 02:23.680
No idea.
Communication was never our strong point.

02:31.920 --> 02:34.600
Whoo-hoo. [Chuckles]

02:34.680 --> 02:37.920
Now that is
a very romantic-looking plate.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.520
It's all very romantic.

02:39.600 --> 02:43.720
It's difficult to tell.
It's not a conducive atmosphere, is it?

02:43.800 --> 02:46.400
Complimentary dinner
for the bride, groom, plus four guests.

02:46.480 --> 02:49.440
So, obviously you, me and our parents
is the natural wedding six.

02:49.520 --> 02:51.960
Is it, though?
It's very ambiguous.

02:53.760 --> 02:55.840
- Thanks for inviting us, anyway.
- [slurping] Mmm.

02:55.920 --> 02:56.960
Oh, it's our pleasure.

02:57.040 --> 02:58.840
I'm only sorry you can't sample
the bedrooms.

02:58.920 --> 03:00.000
[laughs]

03:00.080 --> 03:01.200
Not like that.

03:02.440 --> 03:06.160
We'll just watch a film
and get room service breakfast.

03:06.720 --> 03:09.840
We'll probably just get a packet of crisps
on the train back, won't we?

03:09.920 --> 03:13.080
Duck is a popular choice
at weddings held here.

03:13.160 --> 03:16.400
It's like chicken,
yet somehow more celebratory.

03:16.480 --> 03:17.760
[Helen] Mmm.
[Angus] Mmm.

03:19.520 --> 03:21.920
This isn't a plate that says
"best day of your life," is it?

03:22.000 --> 03:23.360
Not even "best day of the week."

03:23.440 --> 03:26.120
- Thoughts, Dylan?
- Sorry, just, uh, trying...

03:26.200 --> 03:28.240
Um, I'm meant to be
on a date with Liv.

03:28.320 --> 03:30.880
Completely forgot and she's just had
some bad news about her dog.

03:30.960 --> 03:33.040
So just trying to...
[inhales] sort that out.

03:33.120 --> 03:35.040
- Why don't you call her?
- She doesn't pick up!

03:35.120 --> 03:36.360
Even though her phone's on,

03:36.440 --> 03:38.400
'cause she's texting me
those annoying faces.

03:38.480 --> 03:39.880
[groans] It drives me mad.

03:39.960 --> 03:42.040
You see, um,
Dylan doesn't really do texting, Helen.

03:42.120 --> 03:43.840
[stammers] He's more of an analog guy.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.080
Analog. Okay.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.280
Our favorite option
had a ballroom for the dancing.

03:53.080 --> 03:54.680
Apparently, this place has a spa.

03:54.760 --> 03:57.000
Who would go for a sauna
in the middle of a wedding?

03:57.800 --> 04:02.360
There. "Sorry to hear that." Crying face.
And send. [Chuckles]

04:02.440 --> 04:05.280
Wish I'd known there was a spare place.
Would've invited her.

04:05.360 --> 04:08.120
Should I just start
accosting random waitresses to join us?

04:08.200 --> 04:09.960
Maybe have them be my bridesmaids?

04:10.040 --> 04:12.360
Definitely get the brunette
who brought the starters over.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.520
That is it.
They are off your list.

04:14.600 --> 04:15.960
- Both of them?
- Yes.

04:16.040 --> 04:18.360
- Which list were we on?
- Best man. You were short-listed.

04:18.440 --> 04:22.600
- [gasps] Angus, we'd love to.
- A best man requires certain qualities.

04:22.680 --> 04:25.080
- Which qualities do we lack?
- All of them.

04:25.160 --> 04:26.400
You can have my brother.

04:26.480 --> 04:28.880
- I don't like your brother.
- He doesn't think much of you,

04:28.960 --> 04:31.400
but you'd do that for me,
because I love you.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.920
- At least that's something.
- What does that mean?

04:34.760 --> 04:35.920
Love.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.640
You know, the love
twixt you and Angus...

04:37.720 --> 04:39.680
[stutters] it's extremely moving.

04:39.760 --> 04:41.520
[Dylan and Evie snickering]

04:48.720 --> 04:50.840
They'll need to get a move on,
or they'll miss the train.

04:50.920 --> 04:51.960
They are grown-ups, love.

04:52.040 --> 04:53.240
- Oh, snap!
- Snap!

04:53.320 --> 04:54.960
[both laughing]

04:58.880 --> 05:00.520
[breathing heavily]

05:10.960 --> 05:13.200
[continues breathing heavily]

05:28.320 --> 05:29.720
More steam?

05:30.920 --> 05:32.760
[chuckles lightly] The hotter the better.

05:32.840 --> 05:35.560
"Hotter the better"
happens to be my family motto.

05:35.640 --> 05:37.600
[speaking Latin]

05:37.680 --> 05:38.800
[chuckles]

05:39.560 --> 05:42.600
[chuckles] It actually is.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.080
[steam hissing]

05:51.440 --> 05:53.720
Could you handle another ladle?

05:54.440 --> 05:56.760
- Go for it.
- [chuckles]

05:58.040 --> 05:59.640
[steam hissing]

06:12.560 --> 06:14.680
[stammers and exclaims]

06:27.800 --> 06:30.280
- It's happened! Guys...
- You're gonna miss your train.

06:30.360 --> 06:31.960
I am in love, okay?

06:32.040 --> 06:34.600
It has happened for me
in a big way here, guys.

06:34.680 --> 06:36.720
I'm not expecting it, and then bam!

06:36.800 --> 06:38.560
Cupid's little sniper shot
right to the head.

06:38.640 --> 06:41.680
[exclaims]
Brains all over the walls, guys.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.280
This girl is fantastic.

06:44.360 --> 06:46.520
[Helen] I'll order you a cab.

06:46.600 --> 06:47.680
So, what's she like?

06:48.800 --> 06:49.960
She's gorgeous, man.

06:50.040 --> 06:52.800
I mean, I'm talking like...
like, sweaty gorgeous.

06:52.880 --> 06:54.120
But as a person?

06:54.200 --> 06:56.520
I don't know,
but there was just a real connection.

06:56.600 --> 06:58.560
- Where did you meet her?
- In the sauna just now.

06:58.640 --> 06:59.840
[Evie] When you say connection,

06:59.920 --> 07:02.200
do you actually mean
that you were both just nearly naked?

07:02.280 --> 07:04.080
[Dylan] Was it like a soul connection?

07:04.160 --> 07:06.600
Did it feel like,
"Wow, this person really understands me,

07:06.680 --> 07:09.800
and I feel the same.
I could really love this person"?

07:09.880 --> 07:12.160
- You're confusing me.
- What do you think was going on?

07:12.240 --> 07:14.640
Look, all I know is
I need to see her again.

07:14.720 --> 07:18.280
- That sounds like love.
- I need to take that bikini off.

07:18.360 --> 07:20.360
That still... could be love?

07:20.440 --> 07:21.720
Do you even know her name, Luke?

07:21.800 --> 07:25.840
No, but she looks good in a bikini
and she can handle some serious heat.

07:25.920 --> 07:28.320
Pop all that into Linkedln,
you'll probably track her down.

07:28.400 --> 07:31.000
- Do you think I should stay and find her?
- The hotel's booked out.

07:31.080 --> 07:33.640
What if I feel about this girl
the way Dylan feels about every girl?

07:33.720 --> 07:35.840
- Hey!
- I'm in love, guys, all right?

07:35.920 --> 07:37.280
I think I'm in love with her!

07:37.360 --> 07:39.080
Or I really wanna have sex with her.

07:39.160 --> 07:41.000
You know, I'm confused, look at me.
[laughing]

07:41.080 --> 07:44.000
For the love of God,
will you go and get in that taxi?

07:45.840 --> 07:47.720
I don't think I want to do that.

07:49.560 --> 07:53.400
I've put our underwear in the top drawer,
which is cramped and sticks a little.

07:53.480 --> 07:54.840
- Can you write that down?
- Yeah.

07:54.920 --> 07:57.800
I think the hotel with the ballroom
will be closest for most people.

07:57.880 --> 07:59.400
Oh, well,
that's that decision made.

08:01.440 --> 08:04.040
I'm sorry I've been such a nightmare.

08:04.120 --> 08:06.240
You can have whoever you want
as your best man.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.800
- No, you make a good point.
- [chuckles softly]

08:08.880 --> 08:10.160
- [knocking on door]
- Oh.

08:10.240 --> 08:13.640
Daddy ordered
two room service orange juices.

08:13.720 --> 08:15.400
Freshly squeezed.

08:19.320 --> 08:20.320
Ooh, nice.

08:21.440 --> 08:24.520
- You've missed your train.
- Ah, we really nearly caught it.

08:26.800 --> 08:27.800
[gasps]

08:29.920 --> 08:31.280
Well, what are you gonna do now?

08:33.600 --> 08:35.880
You can't stay here.
I wouldn't sleep a wink.

08:36.360 --> 08:38.120
[snoring]

08:56.040 --> 08:57.600
[whispering] Can't you sleep?

08:58.800 --> 08:59.920
Wide awake.

09:01.600 --> 09:02.920
You want me to help?

09:04.600 --> 09:05.640
How?

09:06.640 --> 09:07.840
I could rub you.

09:09.160 --> 09:10.240
Where?

09:10.320 --> 09:12.560
Which bits of you aren't asleep?

09:14.640 --> 09:16.000
All of me.

09:16.080 --> 09:19.920
Okay, that's where I'll start.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.840
What about the others?

09:22.960 --> 09:24.960
Try to stay quiet.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.040
[Evie gasps]

09:27.120 --> 09:29.320
Oh, my God. [Chuckles]

09:37.200 --> 09:38.760
[moans]

09:38.840 --> 09:40.360
[gasping]

09:45.720 --> 09:47.000
[whispering] Holy fuck.

09:47.840 --> 09:48.840
Say what?

09:49.960 --> 09:51.000
What are you doing?

09:51.080 --> 09:53.560
Can't sleep knowing
she's out there, Evelyn.

09:54.120 --> 09:56.720
- All the things that were left unsaid.
- Like what?

09:56.800 --> 09:58.720
Mostly innuendos about steam,
to be honest.

09:58.800 --> 10:00.360
But good ones, you know.

10:00.920 --> 10:02.800
Why don't you just find her at breakfast?

10:03.280 --> 10:04.840
Then it'll look like I bumped into her.

10:04.920 --> 10:07.280
No, this girl needs to know
I sought her out.

10:07.360 --> 10:10.080
Yeah, but it's too late
for soughting girls, Luke.

10:10.560 --> 10:12.240
This is destiny, mere Evie.

10:12.320 --> 10:15.080
I'm like King Arthur
pulling the sword out of the stone.

10:15.160 --> 10:18.960
Only in this case,
the sword is actually my penis, and the...

10:19.040 --> 10:20.280
Yeah, got it.

10:20.360 --> 10:22.240
...the stone is her vagina.

10:27.560 --> 10:28.920
[whistles]

10:29.000 --> 10:31.080
- [bell dings]
- Hi, can I help?

10:31.160 --> 10:32.480
I sincerely hope so.

10:32.560 --> 10:35.360
I am trying to track down
one of your guests.

10:35.440 --> 10:37.560
- Yep. Do you have a name?
- No.

10:37.640 --> 10:40.160
But what I can tell you is,
she is gorgeous

10:40.240 --> 10:42.520
and boy, does that girl like steam.
[chuckles]

10:42.600 --> 10:43.760
Steam generally or...

10:43.840 --> 10:45.440
Uh, we met in the sauna.

10:45.520 --> 10:47.160
Shall I make a note
to have it cleaned?

10:47.240 --> 10:50.440
- Woof.
- Sorry. Inappropriate.

10:50.520 --> 10:53.440
No, no. Actually, entirely on point
with my hopes and expectations.

10:53.520 --> 10:54.520
So, can you help me?

10:54.600 --> 10:58.400
Uh, we don't keep photos of guests.
We really do rely on the names.

10:58.480 --> 11:01.240
Fuck! I mean, come on, lady,
this is the 21st century!

11:01.320 --> 11:02.480
I know.

11:02.560 --> 11:04.120
All right. Thanks, anyway.

11:05.920 --> 11:08.280
- Can't sleep now.
- Nothing to be done.

11:08.360 --> 11:09.480
[knocking on door]

11:11.080 --> 11:13.320
Back to bed I come, Helen.

11:13.400 --> 11:15.200
I've spread out.
Get in with Dylan.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.480
[Abigail] Are you after a drink?

11:20.560 --> 11:23.520
[grunts] Well, what I'd really like
is to sleep.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.480
Shall I make it a really big drink then?

11:25.560 --> 11:27.880
- Sounds good.
- What's keeping you up?

11:27.960 --> 11:29.240
Mmm...

11:29.320 --> 11:33.320
actually, I just had a sex dream
about my best mate.

11:33.400 --> 11:35.760
Right, and how was that?

11:35.840 --> 11:37.680
He was lying next to me
at the time.

11:37.760 --> 11:42.480
Just stop me
if I'm asking too many questions, but...

11:42.840 --> 11:44.600
is it someone
you want to sleep with?

11:44.680 --> 11:48.160
Ah, well, we... we slept together ages ago
and now we're friends.

11:48.240 --> 11:51.440
Sort of avoided the question.
[chuckles] Now I'm just pointing that out

11:51.520 --> 11:53.960
- in case it's helpful.
- Yep, very helpful.

11:54.040 --> 11:56.280
- Thanks for the catch.
- I'm sorry for prying.

11:56.360 --> 11:57.520
It's been a slow night.

11:57.600 --> 12:01.080
Apart from one guy who came in
asking for help stalking people.

12:03.520 --> 12:05.600
The thing about this guy, I just...

12:05.680 --> 12:09.440
I don't know if he's the type to go
from being a friend to something else.

12:09.520 --> 12:10.400
He's just...

12:10.880 --> 12:15.760
so about the big fireworks
and being blown away by the new big thing.

12:15.840 --> 12:17.640
I'm probably not the expert here.

12:17.720 --> 12:22.840
I'm sleeping with a guy
where we were friends first, then lovers,

12:22.920 --> 12:25.160
but have somehow managed
to completely miss

12:25.240 --> 12:26.400
there being any kind of spark.

12:26.480 --> 12:28.200
[both chuckle]

12:29.360 --> 12:31.080
[Helen snoring]

12:37.920 --> 12:39.080
[whispering] Dylan.

12:40.200 --> 12:41.200
Dylan.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Dylan.

12:43.920 --> 12:46.080
Dylan. Dyl.

12:46.160 --> 12:47.760
Dylan.

12:47.840 --> 12:48.840
Dylan.

12:49.800 --> 12:50.800
Dylan.

12:51.680 --> 12:52.680
Dyl.

12:53.480 --> 12:54.920
- [loudly] Dylan.
- [screams]

12:55.000 --> 12:57.040
- [gasps] What's happening?
- Fire! Is there a fire?

12:57.120 --> 12:58.520
[stutters] There's no fire.

12:58.600 --> 13:00.760
- Why did someone scream?
- It was Luke, in my face.

13:00.840 --> 13:02.440
You startle very easily.

13:02.520 --> 13:06.520
I am trying to get to sleep!
I have not managed to sleep yet!

13:06.600 --> 13:09.080
Actually, Helen,
you have managed to get to sleep,

13:09.160 --> 13:10.800
and you snore like a...

13:13.680 --> 13:15.720
- All right!
- [door slams]

13:16.640 --> 13:18.000
I was trying to wake you quietly.

13:18.080 --> 13:21.880
So, like, shake my arm or something.
Don't loom up into my face. It's sinister.

13:21.960 --> 13:24.240
This is all besides the point.
I need to find her.

13:24.320 --> 13:27.200
I can't sleep knowing
that she's somewhere close by,

13:27.280 --> 13:28.320
and not having sex with me.

13:28.400 --> 13:29.920
- [cell phone chimes]
- It's Liv.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.520
"What the hell is wrong with you?"
What does that mean?

13:32.600 --> 13:34.480
She's asking,
"What the hell is wrong with you?"

13:34.560 --> 13:36.440
She sounds really pissed off.

13:36.520 --> 13:38.800
There isn't even one of those
little, uh, face pictures.

13:38.880 --> 13:40.200
They're called emoticons, Dylan.

13:40.280 --> 13:42.320
It's stressing me out
just listening to you.

13:42.400 --> 13:44.480
- Do you even like this girl?
- Yeah, I do, actually.

13:44.560 --> 13:45.920
You'll find she's no sauna girl.

13:46.000 --> 13:50.800
I'm putting, "Did I do something wrong?"
Sad crying face.

13:50.880 --> 13:54.280
[chuckles] I am negotiating
for your reentry as best I can.

13:54.360 --> 13:56.400
I'm not coming back in. No way.
I've got to find out

13:56.480 --> 13:58.480
whether me and this girl have chemistry
with clothes on.

13:58.560 --> 14:00.680
- But how?
- The old-fashioned way, baby.

14:00.760 --> 14:03.520
Door to door. [Exhales]
I'm gonna smoke her out.

14:03.600 --> 14:05.440
No, no, no, no, no.

14:05.520 --> 14:08.840
[Abigail] So he's romantic.
[Evie] Yes. [Sighs]

14:08.920 --> 14:10.080
[Abigail chuckles]

14:10.160 --> 14:12.920
- And when you slept together...
- A long time ago.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.360
But it was good?

14:14.920 --> 14:17.880
Mmm... really good. [Chuckles]

14:17.960 --> 14:19.800
- So, then why don't you just...
- I don't know.

14:19.880 --> 14:22.840
I don't know.
He used to be so annoying and now...

14:23.480 --> 14:25.880
he's just not as annoying.
I don't know how that happened.

14:27.560 --> 14:29.920
Is that for room service?

14:30.720 --> 14:32.040
No, it's for you.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.360
- Was that...
- Yeah.

14:35.880 --> 14:38.080
- [laughs]
- He seems nice.

14:38.160 --> 14:41.520
It's the neck smell, ultimately, isn't it?

14:42.080 --> 14:44.280
Either it makes you [sighs]
feel something,

14:44.360 --> 14:46.960
or it's just someone's neck.

14:47.040 --> 14:49.480
- What's his like?
- A bit stubbly.

14:49.560 --> 14:51.160
[both laughing]

14:51.240 --> 14:53.360
Mmm, but he's really nice.

14:53.440 --> 14:56.320
- But you can't invent a spark?
- Right.

14:56.400 --> 15:00.080
- So, I should say something.
- Well, is it going to change?

15:00.160 --> 15:02.320
I don't think so.
Not for the better.

15:03.120 --> 15:05.560
Yeah, you should probably
say something then.

15:07.600 --> 15:09.440
Okay, thanks, number eight. Cheers.

15:09.520 --> 15:11.480
Please, stop.
The hotel has my credit card.

15:11.560 --> 15:13.200
How else do you suggest I do this?

15:13.280 --> 15:15.360
I suggest you don't do it at all!
Dylan!

15:15.440 --> 15:16.640
She's just written, "Fuck you."

15:16.720 --> 15:19.480
Luke, what's the emoticon
for feeling hurt, but also a bit confused?

15:19.560 --> 15:20.640
God, this is exhausting.

15:20.720 --> 15:23.080
[Angus] Dylan, tell Luke to stop it!

15:23.160 --> 15:25.840
Kind of busy here, Angus.
Anyway, what if sauna girl's the one?

15:25.920 --> 15:27.840
- How many rooms in this hotel?
- [inhales deeply]

15:29.000 --> 15:30.640
All right, Angus, you're right.

15:30.720 --> 15:32.880
When you're right, you're right.
I'm still doing it.

15:32.960 --> 15:34.160
What?

15:36.560 --> 15:38.040
- [door opens]
- [man] What?

15:38.120 --> 15:39.760
Hello, sir.
Sorry to disturb and all that.

15:39.840 --> 15:42.320
- I'm looking for a girl about yea high.
- Are you the police?

15:42.400 --> 15:44.440
Mmm, for now let's just say
I'm an interested party.

15:44.520 --> 15:47.040
- Is she in your room?
- Why would she be in my room?

15:47.120 --> 15:49.960
She's not in my room, and I'm trying
to narrow things down a bit.

15:50.040 --> 15:52.240
If she was in your room,
wouldn't you have arrested her?

15:52.320 --> 15:55.760
Believe me, sir, nobody wants to
see this girl in handcuffs more than I do.

15:57.680 --> 16:00.120
Oh, well.
I think that went pretty well.

16:00.200 --> 16:02.320
- Let's do it.
- No, no, no, no, no.

16:02.400 --> 16:05.880
Just consider the odds.
Every single room in this massive hotel.

16:05.960 --> 16:07.880
But what are the odds
of finding your soulmate?

16:07.960 --> 16:12.560
- And if Luke thinks she could be the one...
- Luke thinks she looks hot in a bikini.

16:12.640 --> 16:15.240
I know that one of you chaps
will end up being right about this.

16:15.320 --> 16:19.240
I just honestly couldn't tell you which.
That is why I need to try and find her.

16:19.320 --> 16:21.080
- No, no, no.
- Could you come with me, lads?

16:21.160 --> 16:22.400
We've had a complaint.

16:23.760 --> 16:24.880
Already?

16:24.960 --> 16:27.680
[laughing]
And then she says to me,

16:27.760 --> 16:30.280
"Yes, I could handle
another scoop of water."

16:30.360 --> 16:33.720
[laughing] Do you see... do you see
what I'm dealing with here, hotel guy?

16:33.800 --> 16:35.920
[laughs] Crazy.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.240
Hey, okay, so we've established
that you've got CCTV.

16:38.360 --> 16:40.120
How do you feel about me
reviewing the tapes,

16:40.200 --> 16:42.240
see if we can track her down
to a specific floor?

16:42.320 --> 16:45.160
I don't mind doing the lion's share
of the leg work. Obvs. [Laughs]

16:48.800 --> 16:50.360
- Go to bed!
- Yeah.

16:50.440 --> 16:51.720
- And stay in bed!
- Bed. Bed.

16:51.800 --> 16:53.880
I might go to bed, boys, actually.

16:56.360 --> 16:58.920
We were friends
and then we were a bit more.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.480
This is really just us taking a step
back again to where we were.

17:03.680 --> 17:04.720
We're breaking up?

17:04.800 --> 17:09.000
You're a lovely guy, but I'm sorry,
I just don't feel that way about you.

17:09.079 --> 17:11.319
There's... no spark.

17:11.400 --> 17:12.720
[clears throat]

17:12.800 --> 17:15.880
[stutters] Well, I've got an order
for late-night sandwiches

17:15.960 --> 17:17.079
I should get on with.

17:17.160 --> 17:19.680
- Steve...
- [whimpering] I said, "sandwiches."

17:21.160 --> 17:22.440
Sorry.

17:22.520 --> 17:24.079
[breathing shakily]

17:28.760 --> 17:30.280
[snoring]

17:35.440 --> 17:38.680
I don't think he'll be baking me
a birthday cake this year.

17:38.760 --> 17:39.840
[chuckles]

17:39.920 --> 17:42.560
- Anyway, over to you.
- How do you mean over to me?

17:42.640 --> 17:45.600
I feel like I should return
the stop-bullshitting-yourself favor.

17:47.040 --> 17:48.520
What about this friend of yours?

17:48.600 --> 17:50.160
Oh...

17:50.240 --> 17:52.720
- Sorry, look, have you seen Steve?
- Uh, yeah, he's around.

17:52.800 --> 17:56.000
[sighs heavily] He's gone AWOL
and we've got room service orders.

17:56.080 --> 18:00.200
If you see him, tell him that either
room 504 gets its omelet or he's fired.

18:00.280 --> 18:02.240
I have had it with today.

18:04.920 --> 18:06.680
[Helen snoring]

18:13.920 --> 18:16.240
[whispers] See how you like this, lady.

18:20.320 --> 18:22.440
- [sputters] What...
- [clatters]

18:22.520 --> 18:24.360
- Fire!
- What are you doing?

18:24.440 --> 18:25.680
I was just adjusting you.

18:25.760 --> 18:28.160
- Why were you touching me?
- You were snoring.

18:28.240 --> 18:30.600
- Is there a fire?
- No, I don't think so. It's just Luke.

18:30.680 --> 18:33.600
- Why do you keep shouting "fire"?
- Well, it's the biggest fear, isn't it?

18:33.680 --> 18:36.280
Building ablaze, corridors of people
trampling all over you,

18:36.360 --> 18:38.280
and then you get cold
while you wait outside.

18:38.760 --> 18:41.000
You, sir, have just had a brilliant idea.

18:41.080 --> 18:44.160
You, Luke, are banned from the wedding.
Officially!

18:44.240 --> 18:45.400
I have had it!

18:45.480 --> 18:46.720
Hold that thought.

18:51.520 --> 18:53.320
[Steve whimpering]

18:53.400 --> 18:55.240
[Abigail] They're going to fire you!

18:55.320 --> 18:57.720
You have to come out
of the fridge, Steve!

18:57.800 --> 18:59.240
Cheese omelet.
Maybe I could do that.

18:59.320 --> 19:02.720
- We can still be friends.
- [Steve] You don't need my friendship!

19:02.800 --> 19:05.800
You've got your writing
and your ambitions.

19:05.880 --> 19:08.480
All I've got
is a fridge full of duck fillets

19:08.560 --> 19:10.760
and a black hole
where my heart used to be.

19:10.840 --> 19:13.240
[whispers] Chefs,
they're emotional people.

19:13.960 --> 19:15.040
[sighs]

19:15.120 --> 19:16.240
[fire alarm wailing]

19:17.120 --> 19:18.360
Shit! Was that me?

19:20.840 --> 19:24.680
You have to come out now, Steve!
You can't hide in the fridge in a fire!

19:24.760 --> 19:26.920
It's very cold in there.
He might actually be all right.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.080
What do you think?

19:28.160 --> 19:29.800
- [indistinct chatter]
- [alarm continues]

19:32.040 --> 19:34.640
Oh, it's rather comforting
when you know it's not for real.

19:34.720 --> 19:36.200
[chuckles] Oh!

19:36.280 --> 19:38.040
Thanks, sausage.

19:38.120 --> 19:39.120
Steve?

19:39.200 --> 19:42.080
- You have to come out now, Steve!
- [Steve] You're wrong!

19:42.160 --> 19:43.840
We did have a spark.

19:43.920 --> 19:46.600
- Any ideas?
- Steve?

19:47.160 --> 19:48.280
[Steve] Who's that?

19:48.360 --> 19:50.480
Uh, I'm one of the hotel guests.

19:51.280 --> 19:53.560
Oh. [Clears throat]
Is this about room service?

19:53.640 --> 19:55.280
There's a bit of a backlog
at the minute.

19:55.360 --> 19:59.240
No, no, look, um, I just wanted to say
that I really feel for you.

19:59.320 --> 20:03.000
It's just two people not really
feeling the same way about each other.

20:03.080 --> 20:06.800
Look, now the alarm's going off
and she is here instead of going outside

20:06.880 --> 20:09.200
because she does care about you.
She just...

20:10.400 --> 20:11.680
doesn't love you.

20:11.760 --> 20:13.600
And you're one of the guests here?

20:13.680 --> 20:16.400
Steve, I wish I felt differently.

20:16.880 --> 20:18.880
I mean, you can't fake it, can you?

20:18.960 --> 20:23.600
I mean, it's either not there at all,
or it is there...

20:23.680 --> 20:25.560
even if you don't want it to be.

20:27.760 --> 20:30.680
And you find yourself
thinking about them, and...

20:30.760 --> 20:34.560
the idea of it not working out
just makes you feel so...

20:39.280 --> 20:40.640
What if it goes wrong?

20:41.680 --> 20:43.480
What if it doesn't?

20:45.160 --> 20:47.600
[Evie] I never thought
I'd feel this way.

20:52.160 --> 20:55.440
You should have said something.
I thought it was me.

20:56.520 --> 20:59.240
You're not the first lesbians
to break my heart, you know.

21:07.280 --> 21:10.440
- [Angus] Have you spotted her yet?
- No.

21:23.040 --> 21:25.880
There you are.
We were wondering where you were.

21:25.960 --> 21:27.760
[gasps] There she is.

21:28.760 --> 21:30.040
[man grunts]

21:31.480 --> 21:32.720
Hi, there.

21:33.640 --> 21:34.760
All right?

21:36.200 --> 21:37.600
Fire alarm, eh?

21:37.680 --> 21:39.600
Maybe someone
tried that fourth scoop of water,

21:39.680 --> 21:41.360
pushed it too far. [Chuckles]

21:41.840 --> 21:42.960
Yeah.

21:43.880 --> 21:45.040
Maybe.

21:45.840 --> 21:46.840
Yeah. [Laughs]

21:49.600 --> 21:51.720
[laughs] Fuck.

21:53.800 --> 21:55.400
Yeah, probably, actually.

21:55.960 --> 21:57.680
It's probably what happened, isn't it?

22:01.760 --> 22:03.080
Okay, then.

22:03.160 --> 22:05.760
- [sighs] No.
- [Angus] No what?

22:05.840 --> 22:08.720
No connection, no chemistry,
nothing special.

22:08.800 --> 22:10.480
[stammers] She's not the one?

22:10.560 --> 22:13.360
No, no, I think it was just the fact
we were both nearly naked,

22:13.440 --> 22:15.840
but, uh, good to have that
cleared up, though.

22:15.920 --> 22:18.680
You have got to be joking.

22:18.760 --> 22:19.760
[fire alarm stops]

22:19.840 --> 22:22.840
[yawning] Oh, good,
should we head in and get some shut eye?

22:22.920 --> 22:25.200
I am absolutely pooped.

22:25.280 --> 22:26.960
- [cell phone chimes]
- [Luke] Goodness.

22:27.040 --> 22:29.560
What? She says
she never wants to talk to me again.

22:29.640 --> 22:31.040
What the hell is her problem?

22:33.040 --> 22:34.240
Mmm.

22:34.320 --> 22:35.880
Your last text message to her was,

22:35.960 --> 22:37.960
"Did I do something wrong?"
Laughing face.

22:38.040 --> 22:40.680
What? No, no, no.
That's a crying face. Look at the tears.

22:40.760 --> 22:43.120
Yeah, no, those are tears of joy, dude.

22:43.200 --> 22:45.160
The little fella's...
He's crying with laughter.

22:45.240 --> 22:47.920
So... so when she said,
"My dog's sick."

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
You found it hysterical. Yeah.

22:50.080 --> 22:52.080
Where does this leave me?
What does it mean?

22:52.160 --> 22:53.440
Do you care?

22:54.080 --> 22:55.520
You know what, I...

22:57.320 --> 22:58.720
I don't think I do.

22:58.800 --> 23:00.840
There you are, then.
That's what it means.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.200
She's right.

23:16.080 --> 23:17.840
[snoring]

24:01.720 --> 24:03.320
[grunting]

24:08.360 --> 24:10.640
It's just the drinks.
The room was complimentary.

24:10.720 --> 24:12.280
Oh, thank you.
We enjoyed it very much.

24:12.360 --> 24:14.880
Would you be happy to sign a contract
for the venue hire now?

24:14.960 --> 24:16.760
Oh, I think that would be a bit premature.

24:16.840 --> 24:20.840
We have CCTV footage of one of your
friends triggering the alarm last night.

24:20.920 --> 24:23.160
It's a £2,000 fine.
[clicks tongue]

24:24.280 --> 24:26.480
- And you have...
- Your credit card details, yes.

24:27.040 --> 24:29.080
And that £2,000 fine...

24:29.160 --> 24:34.120
Can all go away when you sign up
for our deluxe wedding package.

24:34.200 --> 24:36.040
- Deluxe?
- With all the trimmings.

24:36.120 --> 24:39.240
- Expensive trimmings?
- Better value than the fine. [Laughs]

24:39.320 --> 24:40.760
[laughs] Do you have a pen?

24:42.920 --> 24:45.840
Hi, can I leave my e-mail
for the girl behind the bar last night?

24:45.920 --> 24:47.440
Of course.

24:56.840 --> 24:58.480
Finished?

24:58.560 --> 25:00.320
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

25:00.400 --> 25:03.160
- Shall we go?
- Hope you enjoyed your visit!

25:10.520 --> 25:13.320
Well... [sighs]
the hour's nearly up.

25:13.400 --> 25:14.440
How was it?

25:14.520 --> 25:16.880
Pretty much about as bad
as I thought it would be, actually.

25:16.960 --> 25:19.200
Yeah, so it's nice
to have my expectations met.

25:20.520 --> 25:24.600
I know you seem like you're
more comfortable with surface feelings,

25:25.200 --> 25:28.640
but when you just slow down and talk...

25:30.240 --> 25:33.480
you've got a lot more to offer
than just a pretty face, Luke.

25:36.120 --> 25:37.640
I'll see you next week.

25:40.400 --> 25:41.760
[Abigail] I can see me living here.

25:41.840 --> 25:45.080
- What do you think?
- I can see you living here, too.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.080
Mmm.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.520
You smell of grass clippings.

25:55.600 --> 25:57.600
- Yeah, sorry about that.
- No.

25:59.160 --> 26:00.280
I like it.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.200
[upbeat music playing]
