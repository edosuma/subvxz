WEBVTT

00:03.234 --> 00:04.134
Seems like forever,

00:04.135 --> 00:06.436
since the four of us have
been out to eat, you know?

00:06.504 --> 00:07.937
Just the guys.

00:08.005 --> 00:09.272
Oh, God! Yes, we get it.

00:09.340 --> 00:12.175
You have a girlfriend now.

00:12.242 --> 00:13.710
A little jealous, are we?

00:13.777 --> 00:15.030
No, I'm not jealous.

00:18.126 --> 00:20.637
All right, I'd kill a hobo
if it'll get me laid.

00:20.705 --> 00:22.106
Now, can we order?

00:22.173 --> 00:25.708
Oh, dear Lord,
they re-did the menu.

00:25.776 --> 00:27.575
So what?
It's the same food.

00:27.643 --> 00:29.482
Oh, is it?
Look at this.

00:29.550 --> 00:30.719
General Tso's Chicken

00:30.787 --> 00:32.487
is no longer listed
under "specialties."

00:32.555 --> 00:34.589
It's now under "chicken."

00:34.656 --> 00:35.893
So?

00:35.960 --> 00:38.596
Yes, General Tso.

00:39.698 --> 00:42.499
Not "Tso," the chicken,
"so" the question.

00:43.501 --> 00:44.567
So?

00:44.635 --> 00:47.268
So, why is it no longer
a specialty?

00:48.303 --> 00:49.569
Did the chef
lose confidence

00:49.636 --> 00:51.770
in the dish or himself?

00:51.838 --> 00:53.338
And look over here.

00:53.406 --> 00:57.175
"Shrimp in mobster sauce."

00:57.243 --> 00:59.677
What is "mobster sauce"?

00:59.745 --> 01:01.412
It's obviously a typo.

01:01.481 --> 01:03.683
Perhaps. Or perhaps
this restaurant's

01:03.751 --> 01:06.588
now a front for
organized crime.

01:06.656 --> 01:08.090
For all we know,
the mobster sauce

01:08.158 --> 01:11.294
contains actual chunks
of deceased mobsters.

01:11.362 --> 01:13.132
No, no, no, no--
I think it just means

01:13.199 --> 01:15.034
it's the kind of sauce
that mobsters like.

01:15.102 --> 01:17.270
It doesn't mean any of that!

01:17.338 --> 01:18.538
It's a typo.

01:18.606 --> 01:19.773
You know what?
Let's just get a pizza.

01:19.840 --> 01:21.842
Good idea.
We'll go to Corleone's.

01:23.077 --> 01:24.911
Sure, no mobsters there.

01:27.283 --> 01:29.418
You know, the more
I think about it,

01:29.486 --> 01:31.987
the mobster sauce
couldn't possibly contain

01:32.055 --> 01:34.057
chunks of mobster.

01:35.492 --> 01:36.593
And why is that?

01:36.661 --> 01:38.328
It was listed
under "seafood."

01:40.767 --> 01:43.435
What if they were mobsters
who slept with the fishes?

01:43.503 --> 01:45.504
(laughing)

01:48.141 --> 01:50.743
Leonard, are we having a serious
conversation or not?

01:52.947 --> 01:54.380
LEONARD:
What the...?

02:00.521 --> 02:01.621
The TV is gone.

02:01.689 --> 02:03.423
So are our laptops.

02:03.491 --> 02:05.692
Oh, God.

02:05.760 --> 02:07.527
Oh, God.

02:07.595 --> 02:09.596
Oh, God!

02:12.199 --> 02:13.399
It's all right.

02:14.701 --> 02:17.236
They didn't take my comic books.

When does the CSI
team get here?

03:25.718 --> 03:27.652
What?

03:27.720 --> 03:29.721
In anticipation
of their arrival,

03:29.789 --> 03:31.656
I've bagged some evidence.

03:31.724 --> 03:33.458
One of the thieves
had the audacity

03:33.525 --> 03:35.726
to quench his thirst
while ransacking our home.

03:35.794 --> 03:37.895
You should be able to pull
some good prints off this.

03:37.963 --> 03:39.330
And now,
here are my prints

03:39.397 --> 03:41.932
so you can rule me out
as a suspect.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.433
What about me?

03:43.501 --> 03:45.568
I'm sorry, Leonard.
It's too early to discount

03:45.636 --> 03:48.104
the possibility of this
being an inside job.

03:48.172 --> 03:51.608
Would I be completely
out of line to ask you
to shoot him?

03:52.943 --> 03:54.911
I'd be happy to put him
under a 72-hour

03:54.978 --> 03:56.312
psychiatric hold.

03:57.347 --> 03:58.847
I'm not crazy.

03:58.915 --> 04:01.016
My mother had me tested.

04:01.084 --> 04:02.417
We're done here.

04:02.485 --> 04:04.886
Call this number, and we'll fax
you a copy of the report

04:04.953 --> 04:06.354
so you can submit it
to your insurance company.

04:06.421 --> 04:07.855
I-I'm sorry.

04:07.923 --> 04:09.424
That's the end
of your inquiry?

04:09.492 --> 04:13.562
Do you have any more information
that might be relevant?

04:13.629 --> 04:15.630
Oh, my goodness.
Where do I begin? For instance--

04:15.698 --> 04:17.199
my laptop contained

04:17.267 --> 04:19.067
four out of the five
gedankenexperiments

04:19.136 --> 04:20.603
necessary for a cogent
restatement

04:20.671 --> 04:22.038
of the quantum
measurement problem.

04:22.106 --> 04:24.040
How is that going to help them?

04:24.108 --> 04:26.209
Well, they could monitor
scientific publications

04:26.277 --> 04:28.879
and see if anyone posts such
a cogent restatement in the next

04:28.947 --> 04:30.047
couple of months. If so,

04:30.114 --> 04:31.214
the authors are most likely

04:31.282 --> 04:32.916
in possession
of my stolen laptop.

04:34.452 --> 04:35.786
Good night, fellas.

04:37.122 --> 04:39.857
Come on, Bochco.

04:41.727 --> 04:43.095

04:49.468 --> 04:52.436

supposed to do now?

04:52.504 --> 04:54.539
<i>The only thing we can do.</i>

04:54.606 --> 04:57.041
Watch TV on our phones
until the criminals return

04:57.109 --> 04:59.411
and bludgeon us
to death in our sleep.

04:59.478 --> 05:02.580
Does that mean you've ruled
me out as a suspect?

05:02.648 --> 05:04.382
Oh, how I wish I could.

06:08.048 --> 06:09.715
Drat.

06:13.252 --> 06:15.020
I can't believe it.

06:15.087 --> 06:16.788
If I hadn't been
working the dinner shift,

06:16.856 --> 06:18.657
I would've run
right into the robbers.

06:18.724 --> 06:21.026
Hey, there's no reason
for you to be scared.

06:21.094 --> 06:22.260
I'm not scared.

06:22.328 --> 06:24.496
I would've gone all Nebraska
on their asses.

06:26.332 --> 06:27.499
(three knocks)
SHELDON:
Leonard and Penny.

06:27.566 --> 06:28.733

Leonard
and Penny.

06:28.801 --> 06:29.901
(three knocks)
Leonard and Penny.

06:29.969 --> 06:31.102
Hand me the bat.

06:35.374 --> 06:37.474
We just had a major crime
in the building,

06:37.542 --> 06:39.409
and you open the door
without asking who it is?

06:41.179 --> 06:42.712
It won't happen again.
What's up?

06:42.780 --> 06:44.880
Nothing.

06:44.948 --> 06:47.082
I just wanted to see
if you were both okay.

06:47.150 --> 06:48.317
We're fine, Sheldon.

06:49.953 --> 06:51.720
All right, then.

06:51.788 --> 06:54.056
Good night.
Good night.

06:56.092 --> 06:58.426
That was weird,
even for him.
Mm-hmm.

06:58.494 --> 06:59.928

Leonard and Penny.

07:04.566 --> 07:07.435
Who is it?

07:07.503 --> 07:09.237
Sheldon.
Sheldon Cooper.

07:10.472 --> 07:11.706
Yes?

07:11.774 --> 07:13.241
May I come in?

07:15.177 --> 07:17.178
Yeah.

07:24.820 --> 07:26.821
I see you're drinking wine.

07:28.490 --> 07:29.723
Yes, we are.

07:29.791 --> 07:31.158
And we're about to go to bed.

07:31.226 --> 07:33.194
Uh-huh.

07:34.363 --> 07:36.330
Sheldon, do you want
to sleep here tonight?

07:36.398 --> 07:38.900
Oh, as small as Leonard is,

07:38.968 --> 07:41.536
I don't think the two of you'd
be comfortable on the couch.

07:43.373 --> 07:44.740
<i>What do you want?</i>

07:44.808 --> 07:47.776
It's not what I want,
it's what evolution wants.

07:47.845 --> 07:49.045
Human beings are primates.

07:49.112 --> 07:50.779
Primates have evolved
to live in groups,

07:50.847 --> 07:53.182
both for protection
and support.

07:53.250 --> 07:55.652
But you don't like other people.

07:56.954 --> 07:59.656
I do tonight.

07:59.724 --> 08:02.259
It's scary over there.

08:02.327 --> 08:04.529
It's getting scary here, too.

08:12.337 --> 08:15.072
Um... three little kittens?

08:17.676 --> 08:18.742
Three little pigs?

08:21.680 --> 08:23.614

08:54.040 --> 08:55.975

08:56.042 --> 08:58.477
He's right, Penny.
It's all there.

09:00.713 --> 09:03.315
Sheldon, sweetie, I know
you're feeling insecure,

09:03.383 --> 09:05.083
but we've really
got to go to sleep.

09:05.151 --> 09:07.920
All right.
I'll take the first watch

09:07.988 --> 09:09.388
and wake you at 0400.

09:09.456 --> 09:10.823
Great. Good night.

09:10.891 --> 09:12.458
Wait, wait--
what's 0400?

09:12.526 --> 09:14.727
4:00 a.m.
That's, like,
in 45 minutes.

09:14.795 --> 09:16.096
Just keep walking.

09:35.584 --> 09:37.018
WOMAN (on TV):
It's quiet out there.

09:37.086 --> 09:39.187
MAN (on TV):
Maybe a little too quiet.

09:39.255 --> 09:40.521
Where are you going?

09:40.589 --> 09:42.356
Just gonna take a look
around outside.

09:42.424 --> 09:44.425
Bad idea.

09:46.762 --> 09:48.529
No, Jim,
don't open the door!

09:48.597 --> 09:50.932
Listen to her, Jim.

09:52.434 --> 09:53.701
(door opening)

09:53.768 --> 09:54.868
Don't worry.

09:54.936 --> 09:56.202
There's no one out there.

10:11.718 --> 10:14.119
LEONARD (singsongy):
Who is it?

10:18.414 --> 10:21.015
All right, we've got
a titanium dead bolt

10:21.083 --> 10:22.449
and a reinforced jamb

10:22.517 --> 10:25.186
controlled by a state-of-the-art
electronic access system.

10:25.254 --> 10:26.421
What if they cut the power?

10:26.488 --> 10:28.122
There's a 200-watt
uninterruptible

10:28.190 --> 10:29.424
backup power supply.

10:29.492 --> 10:31.193
What if someone steals my keys?
There are

10:31.260 --> 10:33.962
independent voice
and fingerprint scanners.

10:34.030 --> 10:36.231
What if someone kidnaps me,
forces me to record my voice,

10:36.299 --> 10:38.667
and then cuts off my thumb?

10:38.735 --> 10:41.370
I'll send them a
basket of muffins.

10:43.106 --> 10:46.274
Now, inside, we've got
motion detectors,

10:46.342 --> 10:50.578
infrared sensors, and cameras
connected to a server

10:50.646 --> 10:53.548
running state-of-the-art
facial recognition software.

10:53.615 --> 10:55.449
Where did you get
all this stuff?

10:55.517 --> 10:58.285
Eh, I got a buddy over
at the Department of Defense.

10:58.353 --> 10:59.653
He just gave it to you?

10:59.721 --> 11:02.222
I'm sure he would have
if I had asked.

11:03.024 --> 11:03.957
Ironically, their security

11:04.025 --> 11:06.293
isn't all that good.

11:06.361 --> 11:08.728
Raj, your car is blocking me...
(alarm blaring)

11:08.796 --> 11:11.298
COMPUTER VOICE:
Intruder alert, intruder alert.
(screams)

11:11.366 --> 11:12.533
Intruder alert.
What the hell?

11:12.601 --> 11:14.035
Intruder alert.
Sorry, let me help you.

11:15.103 --> 11:16.637
Wonderful
security system

11:16.705 --> 11:19.607
if we're attacked
by a school of tuna.

11:19.675 --> 11:21.877
Don't worry, the net's
going to be electrified.

11:21.945 --> 11:25.848
You picture her on the floor,
spasming uncontrollably.

11:26.783 --> 11:29.619
Better.

11:30.988 --> 11:33.255
<i>SHELDON:
Sheldon's journal.</i>

11:33.323 --> 11:35.257
<i>Security system in place.</i>

11:35.325 --> 11:38.060
<i>However, sleep continues
to elude me.</i>

11:38.128 --> 11:42.231
<i>I've seen the underbelly
of Pasadena...</i>

11:42.299 --> 11:47.203
<i>this so-called City of Roses,
and it haunts me.</i>

11:47.271 --> 11:50.407
<i>Ah, the injustice.</i>

11:50.474 --> 11:53.143
<i>I lie here awake, tormented,</i>

11:53.211 --> 11:56.013
<i>while out there evil lurks,</i>

11:56.080 --> 11:59.350
<i>probably playing Donkey Kong
on my classic Nintendo.</i>

12:01.887 --> 12:03.888
(thud)

12:19.638 --> 12:21.872
(whimpers)

12:31.282 --> 12:33.551
Oh, dear.

12:33.619 --> 12:35.653
(gasps)

12:35.721 --> 12:39.190
I am the master
of my own bladder.

12:43.162 --> 12:45.164
(passing car horn honks)

12:54.374 --> 12:56.075
(three knocks)
Leonard and Penny.

12:56.143 --> 12:57.143
(three knocks)
Leonard
and Penny.

12:57.210 --> 12:58.177
(three knocks)
Leonard and Penny.

12:58.245 --> 12:59.178
Oh, my...

12:59.246 --> 13:02.816
God, Sheldon.

13:04.819 --> 13:08.221
What the hell are you
doing out there?

13:10.791 --> 13:12.792
I heard a noise.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.228
It was us.

13:15.296 --> 13:16.830
We knocked over a lamp.

13:16.898 --> 13:18.798
Why would you
knock over a lamp?

13:18.866 --> 13:20.767
We were going to have...
He doesn't need

13:20.835 --> 13:23.069
to know what we were doing,
Leonard.

13:24.104 --> 13:27.206
Oh.

13:27.274 --> 13:29.675
No, she's right, I don't need
to know what you were doing.

13:29.743 --> 13:31.743
Carry on.

13:31.811 --> 13:32.744
What are you doing?

13:32.812 --> 13:35.380
Use the door.

13:35.448 --> 13:36.815
Good thinking.

13:37.850 --> 13:39.817
Perhaps I'll check
the perimeter

13:39.885 --> 13:41.118
and make
some warm milk.

13:41.186 --> 13:43.688
Great, you do that.

13:43.755 --> 13:46.891
Would you like me to bring you
some warm milk?

13:46.959 --> 13:48.726
I'm lactose intolerant.

13:48.794 --> 13:51.196
And you don't wish to alarm me
with any more loud noises.

13:51.263 --> 13:52.497
Very thoughtful.

13:53.799 --> 13:55.200
Warm milk, Penny?

13:55.267 --> 13:56.667
No, thanks.

13:56.735 --> 13:58.369
Fine.

13:58.437 --> 13:59.671
Good night to you, sir.

14:00.205 --> 14:01.973
Miss.

14:02.040 --> 14:04.042
(door closes, Leonard groans)

14:04.110 --> 14:05.176
Sorry about that.

14:05.244 --> 14:07.044
Ugh, what can you do?

14:07.112 --> 14:08.779
Here.

14:08.847 --> 14:11.648
Intruder alert, intruder alert.
(alarm blaring)

14:11.716 --> 14:13.716
Intruder alert, intruder alert.
(electricity arcing,
Sheldon screaming)

14:17.220 --> 14:19.655
(alarm blaring)

14:19.723 --> 14:23.725
(electricity buzzing)

14:25.161 --> 14:27.662
Looks like Wolowitz got
the net electrified.

14:27.730 --> 14:30.298
Sheldon, are
you okay?

14:30.365 --> 14:31.733
I-I'm fine...

14:31.800 --> 14:36.270
although I'm no longer
the master of my own bladder.

14:39.675 --> 14:41.442
My new computer came

14:41.510 --> 14:44.746
with Windows 7.

14:44.813 --> 14:48.282
Windows 7 is much more user-
friendly than Windows Vista.

14:49.418 --> 14:51.419
I don't like that.

14:54.422 --> 14:56.691
Don't you think looking
for a new city to live in

14:56.758 --> 14:59.126
is a bit of an overreaction?

14:59.194 --> 15:00.995
Our apartment
was broken into,

15:01.062 --> 15:02.863
our security system
tried to kill me,

15:02.931 --> 15:05.832
and as a result,
I'm leaving Pasadena forever.

15:05.900 --> 15:08.402
Tell me how that's overreacting.

15:08.469 --> 15:10.437
Come on, Sheldon,
you can't move.

15:10.505 --> 15:12.072
Don't you need
to stay in one place

15:12.139 --> 15:13.507
so the mother ship can find you

15:13.574 --> 15:16.409
when it returns?
(laughing)

15:16.477 --> 15:19.245
Oh, if that were only true.

15:19.313 --> 15:22.382
Unfortunately, as I'm earthbound
for the foreseeable future,

15:22.449 --> 15:24.917
I need to find a location
that's more hospitable

15:24.985 --> 15:28.320
than the mean streets
of Pasadena, like...

15:28.388 --> 15:30.055
Enid, Oklahoma.

15:30.123 --> 15:31.590
Low crime rate

15:31.658 --> 15:34.793
and high-speed
Internet connectivity...

15:34.861 --> 15:37.395
but no model train shops.

15:39.098 --> 15:41.899
Sorry, Enid.

15:43.902 --> 15:46.169
Is he quitting his job
at the university?

15:46.237 --> 15:48.405
Oh, no, he's going
to telecommute.

15:48.473 --> 15:51.008
Everybody's really
excited about it.

15:51.076 --> 15:52.242
All right.

15:52.310 --> 15:55.278
Boone, North Carolina.

15:55.346 --> 15:57.580
"Every summer since 1952,

15:57.648 --> 16:00.683
"Boone has hosted an outdoor
amphitheater portrayal

16:00.750 --> 16:04.920
of the life and times
of its namesake, Dan'l Boone."

16:06.189 --> 16:08.691
Sounds like something that would
attract the wrong crowd.

16:11.862 --> 16:13.596
Penny, you're from Nebraska,
correct?

16:13.664 --> 16:14.798
Born and raised.

16:20.905 --> 16:23.741
It will take me a few
days to get settled.

16:23.809 --> 16:27.044
After I do, I will e-mail
you detailed PDFs

16:27.112 --> 16:29.013
containing diagrams
and instructions

16:29.081 --> 16:30.815
that will guide you through
packing and shipping

16:30.883 --> 16:33.350
the rest of my possessions
to Bozeman, Montana.

16:34.519 --> 16:36.353
In the meantime,
please forward my mail.

16:37.388 --> 16:38.555
Any place specific

16:38.622 --> 16:41.124
or just the Bozeman,
Montana Loony Bin?

16:42.593 --> 16:44.527
I sense you're making a joke,

16:44.594 --> 16:47.529
but Bozeman does have a comedy
club called The Loony Bin,

16:47.597 --> 16:49.798
so do not forward
my mail there.

16:49.866 --> 16:51.565
Oh, come on.

16:51.633 --> 16:53.467
So you were the victim
of a crime.

16:53.535 --> 16:55.168
That's part of life.

16:55.236 --> 16:57.404
When my great-grandfather
first came to this country,

16:57.472 --> 17:00.239
he put all his
hopes and dreams

17:00.307 --> 17:01.841
into this little
butcher shop he ran

17:01.908 --> 17:03.475
on the Lower East Side
of New York.

17:03.543 --> 17:04.843
You know what happened?

17:04.911 --> 17:07.779
Every customer who walked
into that butcher shop

17:07.847 --> 17:09.248
and asked
for a pound of liver,

17:09.315 --> 17:11.215
(fingers snap)
got ripped off.

17:12.919 --> 17:14.153
But...

17:14.221 --> 17:17.821
those people moved on,
and so should you.

17:17.890 --> 17:19.523
<i>I am moving on.</i>

17:19.592 --> 17:21.659
I'm going to be a Bozite.

17:21.727 --> 17:23.694
They call themselves "Bozites"?

17:23.762 --> 17:25.096
They should. It's one
of the first things

17:25.164 --> 17:26.531
I plan to bring up
upon arrival.

17:28.501 --> 17:30.669
Sheldon, I can't
believe I'm saying this,

17:30.737 --> 17:32.571
but I'm going to miss you.
Please,

17:32.639 --> 17:34.874
Penny, as you know,
I'm not comfortable

17:34.941 --> 17:38.244
with prolonged good-byes
and maudlin displays of emotion,

17:38.312 --> 17:40.313
so I prepared
a short video.

17:43.251 --> 17:44.852
SHELDON (on laptop):
Greetings.

17:44.919 --> 17:48.656
As you know, I'm not comfortable
with prolonged good-byes

17:48.723 --> 17:50.857
and maudlin
displays of emotion,

17:50.925 --> 17:52.693
so I prepared
this short video.

17:52.761 --> 17:56.330
The four of you are three
of my closest friends

17:56.398 --> 17:58.399
and one treasured acquaintance.

18:02.937 --> 18:05.039
Though I cannot state
categorically that my life

18:05.106 --> 18:07.941
will be diminished
by not having you in it,

18:08.009 --> 18:10.177
I am comfortable
if you choose to believe that.

18:12.347 --> 18:13.747
Since you intend to remain

18:13.815 --> 18:16.583
in this lawless
metropolitan area,

18:16.651 --> 18:19.253
statistics suggest that
you will succumb to tragic

18:19.320 --> 18:21.722
and gruesome ends
before we meet again.

18:21.790 --> 18:24.458
Live long and prosper.

18:26.494 --> 18:27.928
Sheldon, that's so...

18:30.498 --> 18:32.999
You might want to lock
the door behind me.

18:34.268 --> 18:35.835
This isn't Bozeman.

18:39.440 --> 18:41.541
How the hell do I know
who's the friend

18:41.609 --> 18:43.277
and who's the acquaintance?

18:46.782 --> 18:48.716
(wind whistling outside)

18:48.783 --> 18:50.918
That is a bracing cold,

18:50.986 --> 18:52.453
an invigorating cold.

18:52.521 --> 18:54.622
Lord, is it cold!

18:56.558 --> 18:58.760
Help you with
your bags, sir?

18:58.828 --> 19:01.496
Thank you, fellow Bozite.

19:01.564 --> 19:04.566
And may I say, you are
the living embodiment of all

19:04.634 --> 19:08.203
the promises made by our lovely
town's Chamber of Commerce.

19:12.175 --> 19:14.176
Wait!

19:15.311 --> 19:17.512
Wait!

19:17.580 --> 19:19.581
Excuse me!

19:23.552 --> 19:25.352
(wind howling)

19:29.224 --> 19:31.859
One ticket to Pasadena,
California, please.

19:38.191 --> 19:39.492
(door unlocking, opening).

19:40.345 --> 19:42.212
Hey, look who's back!

19:42.980 --> 19:44.381
Interesting.

19:44.449 --> 19:46.417
The acquaintance
is the first to greet me.
