"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.367 --> 00:36.433
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.467 --> 00:38.867
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:38.900 --> 00:40.800
in a court of law.

00:42.433 --> 00:44.400
-We have a lot of agencies
that work up here.

00:44.433 --> 00:46.733
CHP, who does
the traffic enforcement,

00:46.767 --> 00:50.233
school district police,
we have other agencies
that are pretty close by.

00:50.267 --> 00:52.833
And a lot of times we overlap
and we assist each other

00:52.867 --> 00:55.333
'cause none of us really
have the number of officers

00:55.367 --> 00:57.500
that we need and when
something big happens,

00:57.533 --> 00:59.600
it's nice that we're able
to come together

00:59.633 --> 01:01.067
to get the job done.

01:01.100 --> 01:03.967
-(radio beeps)
-Officer: 42 Charles,
487, report on watch.

01:04.067 --> 01:06.733
-All right, so CHP
is chasing a vehicle

01:06.767 --> 01:08.300
that's refusing
to yield for 'em.

01:08.333 --> 01:10.500
One of our K9 officers
is in the pursuit,

01:10.533 --> 01:12.633
but otherwise,
our department is

01:12.667 --> 01:14.167
being asked to
stay out of it.

01:14.200 --> 01:17.300
-(radio beeps)
-(police radio chatter)

01:17.333 --> 01:18.600
-STAR is overhead.

01:18.633 --> 01:20.700
Our helicopter unit is overhead
and they're giving us

01:20.733 --> 01:22.067
updates about the pursuit.

01:22.100 --> 01:25.067
-STAR Officer:
43 Charles (indistinct)

01:25.100 --> 01:26.967
He's on Fremont Circle.

925...

02:07.133 --> 02:08.767
-(indistinct)

02:08.800 --> 02:10.367
Do we have permission
to cut him off?

02:13.633 --> 02:16.933
-Officer 1:
(indistinct) Lincoln 21.
How close are you?

02:16.967 --> 02:18.833
-Officer 2:
I am right behind them.

02:20.333 --> 02:22.667

I lost sight of him.

02:27.300 --> 02:29.200
(indistinct)

02:29.233 --> 02:32.100
He's parallel
a drainage canal. Eastbound.

02:32.133 --> 02:33.500
-Officer:
I'm calling in for K9s.

02:33.533 --> 02:35.167
The suspect is still
on foot pursuit.

02:35.200 --> 02:37.967
-Apparently the vehicle crashed
into a local drive-thru.

02:38.067 --> 02:41.367
Our K9 officer
is in foot pursuit
of the suspect.

02:41.400 --> 02:43.533
We're gonna try to
put ourselves in the area

02:43.567 --> 02:45.400
to see if we can
intercept him.

02:45.433 --> 02:48.933
11 X, we're out by CHP,
who are right behind him.

02:48.967 --> 02:52.067
23 from 11 X-ray,
we're approved to
chase this guy, right?

02:53.300 --> 02:55.333
-(door opens, closes)

03:00.833 --> 03:03.500
-11 X-ray,
he should be eastbound.

03:03.533 --> 03:05.467
Behind 49-78.

03:09.233 --> 03:10.433
-Officer 1:
Is he in your backyard?

03:10.467 --> 03:11.767
Can I look
in your backyard?

03:13.967 --> 03:15.467
-Officer 2:
Where'd he go?

03:15.500 --> 03:16.933
Where'd he go?

03:18.267 --> 03:20.800
-Hey, ma'am,
is he with you?

03:20.833 --> 03:22.467
Ma'am!

03:22.500 --> 03:24.067
Ma'am, is he with you?

03:24.100 --> 03:25.700
-Man: Who?
-You!

03:27.333 --> 03:29.700
-When he actually foot bailed
out of the vehicle,

03:29.733 --> 03:31.767
there were several officers
there to chase him on foot.

03:31.800 --> 03:33.333
He's wearing a red shirt.

03:33.367 --> 03:34.633
-Okay.

03:37.067 --> 03:38.633
Hey, did he get him?

03:45.867 --> 03:47.700
He's supposed to be right here.

03:50.467 --> 03:52.600
-Right here.
-Right where? Right here?

03:52.633 --> 03:56.533
-He's like right in here.
-Radio: 73 Charles 925...

03:57.567 --> 03:58.933
-(K9 barks)

03:58.967 --> 04:00.767
-McMahon:
11 X.

04:00.800 --> 04:03.367
-The subject foot bailed
and ran through several fields

04:03.400 --> 04:05.233
down the canal
where the dog tracked him
to the house.

04:05.267 --> 04:07.667
-Okay.
-(K9 whimpers)

04:07.700 --> 04:09.867
-Let's go ahead and back up
a little then.

04:09.900 --> 04:12.533
Our helicopter's overhead
and they're giving us updates.

04:12.567 --> 04:17.467
-11 X-ray, he should be
eastbound behind 4978.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.700
-All right, he's in
the front yard

04:22.733 --> 04:24.667
up against the fence, guys.
Other side of the building.

04:24.700 --> 04:27.333
Look north.
There's a bush
up against the fence.

04:27.367 --> 04:29.500
He is in between
the bush and the fence.

04:29.533 --> 04:31.733
-Right. K9s,
he's in between that bush

04:31.767 --> 04:33.567
right up the nose of your dog
and the fence.

04:33.600 --> 04:34.967
About six feet
in front of ya.

04:35.067 --> 04:36.300
-Supposed to be right here.

04:36.333 --> 04:39.100
-(K9 barks)

04:39.133 --> 04:40.933
-Suspect: Hey, hey! Hey, hey!
-(K9 growls)

04:40.967 --> 04:44.167
-Hey! Hey, hey!
-Come out! Come out!

04:44.200 --> 04:46.067
-11 X-ray, dog deployed.

04:46.067 --> 04:47.767
-Get out! Get out!

04:47.800 --> 04:49.433
Get up!

04:49.467 --> 04:52.367
-(suspect screams)
-Manos arriba, manos arriba!

04:52.400 --> 04:54.100
- Manos aqui! Aqui!
-Okay, okay, okay!

04:54.133 --> 04:55.833
-Put your hands up!

04:55.867 --> 04:57.833
-Just a minute!
Just a minute!

04:57.867 --> 05:00.067
-Loose!

05:00.100 --> 05:01.800
Loose!

05:01.833 --> 05:04.900
Get off the guy!
Get off the guy!

05:04.933 --> 05:07.700
-Hey, he wants us off the guy.
He wants us off the guy.

05:07.733 --> 05:11.233
-(police radio chatter)

05:11.267 --> 05:13.067
-Loose!
-(dog whimpers)

05:14.100 --> 05:15.533
-He's bleeding, man.
-All right.

05:15.567 --> 05:16.567
Watch your back
of the head.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.100
-You got this arm?
-I got him.

05:20.367 --> 05:22.167
-11 X-ray, cuffing.

05:24.533 --> 05:26.600
-He's got--
Um, start a--

05:26.633 --> 05:28.233
Hey, start a bus for him.

05:34.733 --> 05:36.333
-All right, so this guy was

05:36.367 --> 05:38.967
involved in
a vehicle pursuit
with CHP.

05:39.067 --> 05:41.067
He then foot bailed.
Helicopter found him

05:41.067 --> 05:43.300
in this location where
he's hiding behind a tree.

05:43.333 --> 05:45.333
Gave him numerous
commands to come out,

05:45.367 --> 05:47.267
he refused to come out
so the dog pulled him out.

05:51.900 --> 05:54.067
-Please ask him where
he hurts real quick.

05:54.100 --> 05:55.533
-Tiene dolor?

05:55.567 --> 05:57.300
Hey, tiene dolor?

05:57.333 --> 05:58.500
Where?

05:58.533 --> 05:59.733
-La pie.
-Donde?

05:59.767 --> 06:01.667
-La pie.
-La pie? Izquierda?

06:01.700 --> 06:03.633
-Yeah, y el brazo.
-El brazo?

06:03.667 --> 06:05.300
-Yeah.
-I gotta be the same.

06:05.333 --> 06:06.667
Can I get his name real quick?

06:09.267 --> 06:11.067
-McMahon:
So what actually
kicked this all off?

06:11.100 --> 06:13.167
-I catch him going by
doing about 80 miles an hour

06:13.200 --> 06:15.067
down Watt Avenue,
just driving like a maniac.

06:15.067 --> 06:17.600
I go out to pull him over,
takes off back northbound,

06:17.633 --> 06:19.567
he enters the curve
in the roadway here.

06:19.600 --> 06:21.500
Just too fast
for the curve.

06:21.533 --> 06:24.967
Loses control,
spins out, crosses over.

06:25.067 --> 06:27.167
hits the Jack in the Box
drive-thru sign.

06:27.200 --> 06:29.267
He immediately takes off
running on foot.

06:29.300 --> 06:30.800
around the corner here
through the field

06:30.833 --> 06:33.067
and they end up catching him
right by that house
on the other side.

06:33.067 --> 06:34.600
-Considering that
he went through a drive-thru,

06:34.633 --> 06:36.067
if there would have
been a car parked here,

06:36.100 --> 06:37.467
it definitely would have
been a lot worse.

06:37.500 --> 06:38.867
Some people probably
could have got hurt.

06:38.900 --> 06:40.067
-Yeah.
-Worked out pretty well.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.667
-Worked out very well.

06:41.700 --> 06:44.567
-All right, so fire department
came out and evaluated him.

06:44.600 --> 06:47.833
They're recommending
that he be transported
to a local hospital.

06:47.867 --> 06:50.567
Those injuries are minor.
The dog bites are minor.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.567
They recommended that
he just go get checked out

06:52.600 --> 06:55.400
before he's booked into custody
at the Sacramento County
main jail.

06:55.433 --> 06:57.100
-He's the owner of the car.
Have no warrants.

06:57.133 --> 07:00.067
-Okay.
-So, we have no clue what
the heck they're running for.

07:00.067 --> 07:02.067
Always glad to have you in,
helping us out.

07:02.067 --> 07:03.533
Especially on
a high-speed chase.

07:03.567 --> 07:04.667
-Oh, yeah, definitely good

07:04.700 --> 07:06.333
multi-agency effort.
-Yeah, for sure.

07:09.200 --> 07:12.100
-I've been with
the police department
for about three years now.

07:12.133 --> 07:15.767
What really made me want
to become an officer

07:15.800 --> 07:18.567
is the fact that you can
continually give back

07:18.600 --> 07:20.767
to your community
and it's never the same.

07:20.800 --> 07:22.433
You can talk
to kids one day,

07:22.467 --> 07:24.800
you may talk to
a homeless guy
the next day.

07:24.833 --> 07:27.100
You can really give back
to community

07:27.133 --> 07:29.867
in a lot of different ways
other than just going out

07:29.900 --> 07:32.700
and finding criminals.

07:32.733 --> 07:36.700
It's a very, very much
a servant-oriented job.

07:38.967 --> 07:41.167
-There's a grown man
fighting my daughter!

07:41.200 --> 07:42.333
-What's up?

07:42.367 --> 07:44.567
-There's a grown man
fighting my daughter!

07:44.600 --> 07:45.733
-Where?
-Right down there!

07:45.767 --> 07:47.100
He hit my son!

07:47.133 --> 07:48.700
(shouting)

07:51.067 --> 07:53.267
-453 on 2.

07:53.300 --> 07:56.700
Can you show me out
at 27th and Briton
on a possible fight?

07:56.733 --> 07:59.100
-Daughter:
Why can't you just go
straight to the house?

07:59.133 --> 08:02.067
-(man and daughter arguing)

08:04.500 --> 08:07.067
-What's going on?
-Some lady was following
him with a knife.

08:07.100 --> 08:09.233
-Okay. Hey, what's
going on, buddy?

08:09.267 --> 08:12.667
-Man, one of her kids--
her kid hit one of my kids

08:12.700 --> 08:14.067
with a damn, uh, skateboard.

08:14.100 --> 08:15.933
and he was aware of it,
and I hit him on his arm.

08:15.967 --> 08:17.567
I said, "Hey, don't be
doing that (bleep) again."

08:17.600 --> 08:19.567
And then he go in the house
and she's like,

08:19.600 --> 08:21.833
"You better not hit my son again
or my husband gonna whoop

08:21.867 --> 08:23.067
that ass like he did before."

08:23.067 --> 08:24.767
And then first of all,
he ain't whoop my ass.

08:24.800 --> 08:26.367
And she was talking
all that (bleep)

08:26.400 --> 08:29.233
so her daughter came out,
and she got a knife. I said--

08:29.267 --> 08:31.900
-So whose daughter came out?
-Her daughter.

08:31.933 --> 08:33.367
The one in the wheelchair,
her daughter.

08:33.400 --> 08:36.400
-Okay.
-She come follow me
with a knife.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.933
Then she go and throw it
on top of the (bleep)
roof up here.

08:38.967 --> 08:40.267
-Show me where
she threw the knife.

08:40.300 --> 08:41.933
-This green apartment
right here,

08:41.967 --> 08:44.133
she tossed that
on top of the roof.

08:44.167 --> 08:46.067
-So, this all started
because you were...

08:46.067 --> 08:47.533
just home with your kids?

08:47.567 --> 08:49.233
-Discipline.
I disciplined her kid.

08:49.267 --> 08:50.467
I hit him on the arm.

08:50.500 --> 08:52.667
-Okay.
-'Cause he hit
my child with a scooter.

08:52.700 --> 08:54.233
-She threw it up there?
That knife right there?

08:54.267 --> 08:55.700
-Yup. That's it.

08:57.300 --> 08:59.700
-Okay.
-(police radio chatter)

08:59.733 --> 09:02.633
-So what happened?
What did you guys see?

09:02.667 --> 09:04.233
-As soon as they were
down there at that corner,

09:04.267 --> 09:06.467
I saw when I pulled up--
-So, it started down here
at the corner?

09:06.500 --> 09:07.900
-Yes, sir.
All the way down there.

09:07.933 --> 09:10.067
-Okay.
-When I pulled up,
he's trying to get away.

09:10.067 --> 09:11.533
He has nothing
to do with it.

09:11.567 --> 09:13.900
Uh, she's got a knife
in her hand, chasing him.

09:13.933 --> 09:15.767
-Did you see
what the knife looked like?

09:15.800 --> 09:18.300
-It was a red Swiss army knife.
-It had a red? Okay.

09:18.333 --> 09:21.100
-I saw you pull up,
she tossed that knife
over that way

09:21.133 --> 09:23.167
and took off walking
back down the street.

09:23.200 --> 09:24.667
-Just hang tight
for a second.

09:24.700 --> 09:26.200
We're gonna go talk to her.

09:28.067 --> 09:31.433
-Basically...
they were both out here,

09:31.467 --> 09:32.700
and whoever
that guy is back there...

09:32.733 --> 09:36.833
-Okay.
-...they were
interacting out here.

09:36.867 --> 09:39.267
Something happened where
his skateboard hit I think--

09:39.300 --> 09:40.533
Your skateboard
or your foot?

09:40.567 --> 09:41.967
-Child: Skateboard.

09:42.067 --> 09:45.533
-Skateboard hit somebody else
and he came up to him

09:45.567 --> 09:46.833
and slapped him
on his arm.

09:46.867 --> 09:49.067
-He slapped him on his arm
and it was real red and welt up.

09:49.067 --> 09:51.133
-He went inside
crying to his mom

09:51.167 --> 09:53.700
and then she's heard it
from the outside.

09:53.733 --> 09:55.767
She came inside
and started yelling
at him as well.

09:55.800 --> 09:57.967
And then she says
she confronted him

09:58.067 --> 10:00.700
like she was gonna fight him,
but she didn't actually ever
lay hands on him.

10:00.733 --> 10:02.633
-Okay. How old are you?

10:02.667 --> 10:04.600
-17.
-17.

10:04.633 --> 10:06.567
So you didn't pull
a knife or anything?

10:06.600 --> 10:10.500
So why do I have
about five people saying you did

10:10.533 --> 10:12.833
and then you threw
a knife on a roof?

10:12.867 --> 10:14.633
You don't know?

10:14.667 --> 10:16.933
You just think that's
five people that don't know you
telling me something else?

10:16.967 --> 10:18.100
-Yep.

10:18.133 --> 10:19.767
-That's what
you're gonna stick with?

10:19.800 --> 10:21.900
-Do you mind taking her over
there to your car for a minute?

10:21.933 --> 10:23.600
I need to talk to Mom.

10:23.633 --> 10:26.000
So are you Mom to him?

10:26.033 --> 10:28.867
-Yes.
-Did you ever give him
permission to discipline--

10:28.900 --> 10:32.733
-Yeah, any... As I explained
to that officer,

10:32.767 --> 10:34.867
anybody that watches my son...
-Right.

10:34.900 --> 10:36.700
-I give them permission
to discipline him.

10:36.733 --> 10:38.800
But don't go overboard with it.

10:38.833 --> 10:40.433
That's gonna cause problems.

10:40.467 --> 10:42.867
-I understand.
So, you don't know anything
about this whole knife deal?

10:42.900 --> 10:45.667
-No!
-Okay, well, like I said,
I got other people

10:45.700 --> 10:46.800
that saw her
with a knife.

10:46.833 --> 10:48.967
-How come they want
my baby to...

10:49.000 --> 10:50.633
-I'm just telling you
what I'm told, okay?

10:50.667 --> 10:52.933
Again, you saw us,
you waved us down.

10:52.967 --> 10:56.067
-Yes.
-Okay, how far did she chase
him down the street?

10:56.100 --> 10:58.567
-They-- Where you saw 'em at.

10:58.600 --> 11:01.900
-So she-- Why did she chase him
all the way down there

11:01.933 --> 11:03.133
after he's already gone?

11:03.167 --> 11:04.400
-That, I tried to stop her.
-Okay.

11:04.433 --> 11:05.933
-I tried.
-So she was just upset?

11:05.967 --> 11:08.233
This is older sister to him?
-Uh-huh.

11:08.267 --> 11:09.833
-So she's just taking care
of her brother?

11:09.867 --> 11:11.867
Okay, well, hang tight
for a second, all right?

11:13.067 --> 11:14.533
So tell me your story.

11:14.567 --> 11:16.367
-I came home
from being with a friend

11:16.400 --> 11:18.067
and I heard like,
all this yelling

11:18.100 --> 11:19.900
and my mom was like
"He put his hands on Kenny."

11:19.933 --> 11:21.633
-Okay.
-So I was like, "What?"

11:21.667 --> 11:23.700
Came charging at him,
trying to fight him.

11:23.733 --> 11:24.867
-Okay.

11:24.900 --> 11:27.067
So he tried to fight you
or you tried to fight him?

11:27.100 --> 11:29.967
-I tried to fight him
and then he was trying
to fight me.

11:30.067 --> 11:31.467
-Why were you trying
to fight him?

11:31.500 --> 11:34.067
-Because he put his hands
on my little brother
and he left a mark.

11:34.067 --> 11:36.500
-Okay, okay.
So did you pull a knife
on him or what?

11:36.533 --> 11:38.133
-No.
-Huh?

11:38.167 --> 11:40.600
So why would people tell me
they saw you with a knife?

11:40.633 --> 11:43.067
They can tell me that you,
in the blue shirt, had a knife

11:43.067 --> 11:44.600
and tried to throw it
on a roof.

11:44.633 --> 11:46.567
Why would people lie about it?

11:46.600 --> 11:48.167
You don't know?

11:48.200 --> 11:52.233
So I'm trying
to give you a chance
to tell me what happened.

11:52.267 --> 11:54.233
If you want to
stick to it, that's fine.

11:54.267 --> 11:56.067
-Okay.
-Is that what
you're gonna tell me?

11:56.067 --> 11:58.067
-Yeah.
-Okay. Can you put her
in your car for me?

12:00.067 --> 12:01.233
I talked to witnesses.

12:01.267 --> 12:03.200
They said they saw him here,
she follows him,

12:03.233 --> 12:04.633
several times
he's backing up,

12:04.667 --> 12:06.533
sometimes running,
sometimes walking.

12:06.567 --> 12:09.200
He's backing up, being defensive
and she's got the knife

12:09.233 --> 12:11.100
blade down,
fist up like that.

12:11.133 --> 12:12.500
-(mumbles)

12:12.533 --> 12:14.700
She was trying to engage him
into the fight.

12:14.733 --> 12:15.733
-Yeah.

12:15.767 --> 12:17.967
-And if she had it
in her hand,

12:18.067 --> 12:20.300
her intent was
to use the knife

12:20.333 --> 12:22.867
in the fight that she was
trying to engage in, so...
-Okay.

12:22.900 --> 12:25.567
All right, Tamera, step out here
for a minute, please.

12:25.600 --> 12:27.367
Here's what's going on.

12:27.400 --> 12:29.767
You're under arrest
for aggravated assault
right now, okay?

12:29.800 --> 12:31.100
For pulling the knife.

12:31.133 --> 12:32.667
Go ahead and turn around,
face the car for me.

12:32.700 --> 12:34.633
Put your hands behind your back.
You wanna use yours?

12:38.567 --> 12:40.200
-Mother:
Don't arrest my baby.

12:40.233 --> 12:42.700
-I don't have a choice, okay?
It's a felony charge.

12:42.733 --> 12:44.133
-How?
-I'm just telling you.

12:44.167 --> 12:45.967
Third party witnesses
are telling us she followed him

12:46.067 --> 12:48.467
a full city block
with a knife just like this.

12:48.500 --> 12:51.300
Got close enough they thought
she was cutting him.

12:51.333 --> 12:52.567
That's how close
she was to him.

12:52.600 --> 12:55.067
Do you want to talk to her
on the other side?

12:55.067 --> 12:56.400
-Son:
What happened, Mom?

12:56.433 --> 12:58.767
-Mother:
Tamera, I told you
to stay in the house.

13:02.800 --> 13:05.233
-We're gonna make sure
as soon as she's there
she can call you.

13:05.267 --> 13:06.767
All right? And as soon as
the judge sees her,

13:06.800 --> 13:08.933
she'll be set to
get taken care of, okay?

13:08.967 --> 13:10.400
-She'll be going to Randall.

13:10.433 --> 13:13.300
-All right, man,
basically what's going on,
talking to Mom.

13:13.333 --> 13:15.633
For obvious reasons,
she doesn't want you
down there no more

13:15.667 --> 13:19.367
to start any more...
and no more disciplining
the kids, okay?

13:19.400 --> 13:20.933
-Okay.
-Um...

13:20.967 --> 13:22.767
she said the same thing you did.

13:22.800 --> 13:24.300
She gave you permission
to discipline him.

13:24.333 --> 13:26.567
That happens. You know,
I understand, okay?

13:26.600 --> 13:29.833
You did the right thing
by trying to get away from it.

13:32.633 --> 13:34.133
-I'm originally from
Inglewood, California.

13:34.167 --> 13:37.267
I joined the military
right after going to college.

13:37.300 --> 13:39.367
Deployed three times
to Iraq

13:39.400 --> 13:40.667
and once to Afghanistan.

13:40.700 --> 13:43.133
I'd come to a sense
where I needed to

13:43.167 --> 13:44.867
continue that community service.

13:44.900 --> 13:47.100
Coming to Austin,
I just saw the teamwork

13:47.133 --> 13:49.433
and the camaraderie,
and that's what attracted me

13:49.467 --> 13:51.833
to this team and to
the department as well.

13:51.867 --> 13:53.467
-(siren chirps)

13:53.500 --> 13:55.333
-We've got a suspicious vehicle

13:55.367 --> 13:57.067
coming out of one
of the motel areas.

13:57.067 --> 14:00.633
Known drugs,
known prostitution, that area.

14:00.667 --> 14:02.900
I ran the vehicle information.

14:02.933 --> 14:05.400
Seems to be expired
registration tags.

14:05.433 --> 14:08.567
Just gonna go ahead
and check out the vehicle.

14:10.767 --> 14:12.767
-(door opens)

14:17.100 --> 14:19.633
-Hey, how's it going?
I'm Officer Reyes with
the Austin Police Department.

14:19.667 --> 14:21.433
How are you doing today?
-Pretty good, pretty good.

14:21.467 --> 14:23.167
-You got your driver's license?
-I.D., sir.

14:23.200 --> 14:24.633
-Woman:
I don't know,
they got cameras.

14:24.667 --> 14:27.100
-My I.D.
-Mkay.

14:27.133 --> 14:28.133
Is this your vehicle?

14:28.167 --> 14:29.300
-Yeah. I just went
and bought it.

14:29.333 --> 14:30.867
-You just got it?
-Yes.

14:30.900 --> 14:33.233
-Okay.

14:33.267 --> 14:36.633
This is just a receipt
that you just paid
for your insurance.

14:36.667 --> 14:38.933
-Oh.
-Can you step out of the vehicle
for me for a second?

14:40.300 --> 14:41.833
You can put
the phone down, okay?

14:47.400 --> 14:48.967
You all right, man?

14:49.067 --> 14:50.967
-Yes, I'm cool.
-I just asked you
to step out of the vehicle.

14:51.067 --> 14:53.233
-Oh. (indistinct)

14:53.267 --> 14:55.067
-Huh? Come on.
-(indistinct)

14:55.100 --> 14:57.067
-Let's talk here
for a second.
-What's up?

14:57.067 --> 14:58.967
-Have you ever been
arrested before?
-Oh, yeah.

14:59.067 --> 15:01.200
For (mumbles).

15:01.233 --> 15:03.200
-That's pretty much it?
-Yeah, nothing. Nada.

15:03.233 --> 15:06.233
-Before I proceed any further,
do you got any kind of narcotics

15:06.267 --> 15:07.533
on you or anything like that?

15:07.567 --> 15:09.333
-No, nothing, no.
-Is there anything
inside the vehicle?

15:09.367 --> 15:10.767
-Nothing in the vehicle.
-Okay.

15:10.800 --> 15:12.800
-Yes.
-Does she have it?

15:12.833 --> 15:14.500
-She don't have nothing.
-She don't have anything.

15:14.533 --> 15:15.933
Are you sure about that?
-Sure about that.

15:15.967 --> 15:18.100
-Well, who is she to you?
-She a friend. Amiga.

15:18.133 --> 15:20.067
-She's just a friend?
Just riding with you?
-Yeah. Yeah.

15:20.100 --> 15:22.267
-Where are you guys going to?
-Going to a friend's house.

15:22.300 --> 15:24.567
-When's the last time
you consumed any kind
of narcotics?

15:24.600 --> 15:25.833
-I don't do narcotics, sir.

15:25.867 --> 15:27.467
-None? Nothing.
-Nothing.

15:27.500 --> 15:29.567
-Okay, why are you being
a little nervous right now?

15:29.600 --> 15:31.100
-'Cause I'm talking
to a cop, sir.

15:31.133 --> 15:34.400
-But I'm not threatening to you.
I'm not being aggressive to you.

15:34.433 --> 15:35.700
-Okay.
-Okay?

15:35.733 --> 15:38.200
It's just some of this stuff
is not adding up, okay?

15:38.233 --> 15:39.567
-Okay, well, I'm sorry.

15:39.600 --> 15:41.600
-You do know
you have a warrant, right?
-And for what for?

15:41.633 --> 15:43.900
-You have a warrant
for the paraphernalia.

15:43.933 --> 15:45.533
and possibly for
bail jumping as well.

15:45.567 --> 15:47.133
-Bail jumping?
Por que?

15:47.167 --> 15:49.067
-I don't know.
I'm not trying to scare you
or anything like that.

15:49.067 --> 15:51.067
I'm just trying to have
an honest conversation with you.

15:51.067 --> 15:53.533
What I'm gonna do right now
just so I can verify
that information

15:53.567 --> 15:55.500
as far as that warrant's
concerned and stuff like that,

15:55.533 --> 15:57.133
we're gonna place you
in handcuffs, okay?

15:57.167 --> 15:58.367
-Yes, sir.
-It's a detention.

15:58.400 --> 15:59.667
I'm not arresting you right now.

15:59.700 --> 16:01.067
It's just being detained, okay?

16:01.100 --> 16:03.233
-Yes, sir.
-So go ahead and turn
around for me, all right?

16:05.333 --> 16:06.533
-I can't believe
I have a warrant.

16:06.567 --> 16:08.533
-What's that?
-(indistinct)

16:10.600 --> 16:12.867
-Okay. Just relax
your hand, man.

16:12.900 --> 16:14.600
Okay, relax your hand.

16:14.633 --> 16:16.600
All right, just go ahead
and have a seat, okay?

16:27.567 --> 16:29.500
Go ahead and step out
of the vehicle for me.

16:32.967 --> 16:35.100
Is there anything on your person
I should be aware about?

16:35.133 --> 16:36.767
-No, sir. I got (indistinct).
-I'm not asking...

16:36.800 --> 16:38.167
-I got a kit right here
and a lighter.

16:38.200 --> 16:40.133
-I'm not asking you
to go ahead and do
all that, okay?

16:40.167 --> 16:42.100
Did he ask you to hold
anything for him?

16:42.133 --> 16:45.133
-No, sir.
-Before I stopped you guys,
he didn't give you anything?

16:45.167 --> 16:47.200
Just tell me where it's at...

16:48.833 --> 16:50.567
and we'll go on our way.

16:52.100 --> 16:54.400
-Over there.
-Where's over there?

16:54.433 --> 16:56.633
-In that area.
It's not...

16:56.667 --> 16:58.433
-Okay. Where is it at?

16:59.900 --> 17:01.433
It's inside you.

17:01.467 --> 17:04.200
Okay, did he ask you
to put it inside you?
-Yes.

17:04.233 --> 17:06.367
-Okay. What's inside
you right now?

17:06.400 --> 17:07.733
-I don't know.
It's a canister.

17:07.767 --> 17:09.467
-It's a canister?
-Yes.

17:09.500 --> 17:10.900
-Okay.

17:10.933 --> 17:14.567
What does he usually have
as far as what does
he usually carry?

17:14.600 --> 17:17.533
-I don't know. Weed?
I know I smoke weed with him.

17:17.567 --> 17:19.167
-Okay.
-I don't know.

17:19.200 --> 17:20.967
I didn't ask him, I didn't...

17:21.067 --> 17:24.633
-Can you do me a favor?
Just face over there, okay?

17:39.933 --> 17:41.167
-Okay.

17:41.200 --> 17:43.567
-Can I grab something just
to wipe my hands off please?

17:43.600 --> 17:45.167
-Yeah, no problem. Okay.

17:45.200 --> 17:47.467
See if there's a female
available for a search.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.367
-Okay. You gonna call yet?

17:49.400 --> 17:51.900
-Uh, I just put--
I think I put myself

17:51.933 --> 17:54.100
on a traffic stop.
I'm not sure.
-Okay.

17:54.133 --> 17:57.600
-She said that there's
some possible narcotics

17:57.633 --> 17:59.833
or any-- some kind of drugs
inside this container,

17:59.867 --> 18:02.600
which appears to be some...

18:02.633 --> 18:04.200
good amount of some crack.

18:04.233 --> 18:05.900
Some cocaine.

18:06.933 --> 18:08.767
So why did he give you this?

18:08.800 --> 18:10.667
-To hide, I guess.

18:10.700 --> 18:12.100
-To hide? Okay.

18:12.133 --> 18:14.633
Hey, but you had no idea
what was in it?

18:14.667 --> 18:16.667
-No, sir, I did not.
-Did you ask him or anything?

18:16.700 --> 18:18.433
-I said, "What do you want
me to do with this?"

18:18.467 --> 18:21.067
-Okay. Well, just give me
a second, okay?

18:21.100 --> 18:23.500
Um, just keep talking
to her for a second.

18:23.533 --> 18:24.767
Okay?

18:24.800 --> 18:26.067
Go ahead and step out, man.

18:26.100 --> 18:28.067
-That's mine.

18:28.100 --> 18:29.533
-What's yours?

18:29.567 --> 18:31.600
-Whatever-- That right there.
-What is it?

18:31.633 --> 18:33.300
-It's cocaine.
-It's cocaine?

18:33.333 --> 18:34.600
-Yes, it is, sir.
-Okay.

18:34.633 --> 18:37.067
If you have
an addiction problem--

18:37.067 --> 18:39.667
-I don't have an addiction
problem, but I don't see
what I did wrong.

18:39.700 --> 18:42.167
Was my driving messed up,
or what was I doing wrong?

18:42.200 --> 18:43.933
-Pretty much, man. Okay--
-How was my driving?

18:43.967 --> 18:45.933
-But look--
-How was I driving?

18:45.967 --> 18:47.967
-But that's not
what's in question here, okay?

18:48.067 --> 18:50.133
What's in question--
-How was I driving though?

18:50.167 --> 18:52.833
-Okay, you're starting
to get agitated. I understand.

18:52.867 --> 18:57.867
But I'm not the one who was
carrying some powder.

18:57.900 --> 18:58.900
-Okay.
-Okay?

18:58.933 --> 19:00.233
-That's my stuff. It's mine.

19:00.267 --> 19:02.333
-Okay, but why are you taking
the blame for this

19:02.367 --> 19:04.467
if it's not in your possession?
-It's mine. It's mine.

19:04.500 --> 19:06.433
-Okay. All right.
-I gave it to her. It's mine.

19:06.467 --> 19:08.433
-Okay, that's--
All right, man,

19:08.467 --> 19:09.900
let's get you out of here.

19:09.933 --> 19:11.500
Get in the car, man.

19:14.300 --> 19:17.300
So he's admitting
that this is his
and he gave it to her.

19:17.333 --> 19:19.233
I'm gonna cut her loose.

19:19.267 --> 19:21.133
-Okay.
-Okay? Although she had
the stuff in her,

19:21.167 --> 19:23.067
she had it in her possession,
she admitted to it,

19:23.100 --> 19:25.567
but the fact that
the male was the one

19:25.600 --> 19:28.367
that actually handed it to her,
that's why I'mma let her go

19:28.400 --> 19:31.067
and just take him
for the possession of cocaine.

19:34.133 --> 19:37.667
So, do you consume
any of those narcotics?

19:37.700 --> 19:39.233
-Yeah, I do cocaine.
-You do cocaine?

19:39.267 --> 19:42.067
-Yeah.
-Melanie, she's free to go,

19:42.100 --> 19:44.667
so like I said,
you're going to jail
for the possession of--

19:44.700 --> 19:46.533
-Yes, the cocaine.
-Of the cocaine.

19:46.567 --> 19:48.233
-Mm-hmm.
-Mkay.

19:50.167 --> 19:52.333
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:52.367 --> 19:54.300
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:54.333 --> 19:55.467
Cover is code three.

19:55.500 --> 19:58.467
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:04.567 --> 20:07.300
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:07.333 --> 20:08.500
