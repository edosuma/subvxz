WEBVTT

00:02.500 --> 00:05.572
Tickets this way
for the Chatsworth Express!

00:05.660 --> 00:08.173
Come and watch pikeys making a mess

00:08.260 --> 00:11.855
of the lives they were given by
'im upstairs...

00:11.940 --> 00:14.898
And kids they're convinced
aren't actually theirs.

00:14.980 --> 00:16.094
Wicked!

00:16.180 --> 00:17.499
Piss off!

00:17.580 --> 00:21.368
What sounds on Earth
could ever replace

00:21.460 --> 00:24.497
kids needing money
or wives in your face?

00:24.580 --> 00:26.935
Cos this, people reckon -
me included -

00:27.020 --> 00:29.488
is why pubs and drugs

00:29.580 --> 00:31.172
were kindly invented...

00:31.260 --> 00:33.774
To calm us all down
and stop us going mental.

00:33.860 --> 00:38.570
These are Chatsworth Estate's
basic essentials.

00:38.660 --> 00:44.815
We are worth every penny
for grinding your axes...

00:44.900 --> 00:46.379
You sit on our head,

00:46.460 --> 00:49.133
but... you pay the taxes.

00:49.220 --> 00:50.619
CHEERING

00:50.700 --> 00:53.373
Imagine Britain
without Chatsworth buccaneers

00:53.460 --> 00:56.691
who'd come on your face
for the price of a beer, eh?

00:56.780 --> 00:58.259
Eh!

00:58.340 --> 01:02.094
Make poverty history.
Cheaper drugs now!

01:02.180 --> 01:07.049
Make poverty history!
Cheaper drugs now!

01:07.140 --> 01:08.459
CHUCKLES

01:08.540 --> 01:12.169
Scatter! Party!

01:18.580 --> 01:22.289
The average bloke produces
500 million sperm a day.

01:22.380 --> 01:24.769
That's the population
of Brazil in each bollock.

01:24.860 --> 01:28.216
So each of those little tadpole
things that makes it through

01:28.300 --> 01:30.097
and ends up creating a baby

01:30.180 --> 01:32.614
is like a rollover Lottery winner,
total miracle.

01:32.700 --> 01:37.569
Human beings really are amazing.
Well, some of them.

01:37.660 --> 01:39.093
Is that a cock?

01:41.020 --> 01:43.170
No, that's its thigh bone.

01:43.260 --> 01:48.050
And don't say cock
in front of the baby.

01:48.140 --> 01:49.459
What can I say? Knob?

01:49.540 --> 01:55.729
If you want to talk about that area
why don't you say winkle or doo-dah?

01:55.820 --> 01:57.458
Doo-dah? Fuck off!

01:57.540 --> 02:01.852
Honestly, the men in this family!

02:03.260 --> 02:05.137
No soul.

02:11.060 --> 02:13.733
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

02:20.660 --> 02:21.729
< That's right, you dirty...

02:21.820 --> 02:26.177
Shit! I'd hurry up if I were you,
your dad's coming. Get out!

02:31.620 --> 02:34.088
Your bag. Take it, quick. Go, go!

02:37.260 --> 02:38.409
All right, Dad?

02:40.140 --> 02:41.812
What's going on?

02:41.900 --> 02:45.131
Nothing.
Just talking to lan, that's all.

02:45.220 --> 02:47.176
Did you do the pick-up?

02:47.260 --> 02:49.137
Yeah, it went really well.

02:49.220 --> 02:52.371
Really good directions, too. Spot on.

02:52.460 --> 02:54.655
Who needs sat nav
when they've got you?

03:00.820 --> 03:05.371
Good. Well, bring it on home.
I'll be back in an hour.

03:07.060 --> 03:12.737
Have you got a death wish or what?
I'm going town, I'll see you later.

03:16.700 --> 03:19.294
lan, have you seen a blue bag anywhere?

03:19.380 --> 03:21.371
Yeah, I gave it to your boyfriend.

03:21.460 --> 03:24.418
That's my dad's package, you dick.
What did you do that for?

03:24.500 --> 03:27.253
- He dropped it.
- Oh, this is bad!

03:27.340 --> 03:30.218
This is really fucking bad.

03:30.300 --> 03:32.495
Right, come on.
He can't have got far.

03:32.580 --> 03:35.299
It's nothing to do with me, mate.

03:38.740 --> 03:42.779
You just gave away a shed load
of coke meant for Paddy Maguire.

03:42.860 --> 03:44.612
What do you think he'll do
when he finds out?

03:52.940 --> 03:55.329
There goes my night off. Mickey!

03:55.420 --> 03:57.376
Willoughby?
He'll get lynched.

03:57.460 --> 04:00.497
Be nice to have something
different though, wouldn't it?

04:00.580 --> 04:03.299
Not just another
Tracey, Darren or Debbie.

04:04.420 --> 04:06.650
No offence, Debbie.

04:06.740 --> 04:09.538
Well, I wanted to call you Shanty.

04:09.620 --> 04:10.575
Why didn't you?

04:11.620 --> 04:14.896
The baby's name is...

04:14.980 --> 04:17.699
Sh...

04:21.100 --> 04:22.579
Debbie.

04:25.140 --> 04:27.529
Anyway, names are hard.

04:27.620 --> 04:30.418
You've got to have one for a girl
and one for a boy.

04:30.500 --> 04:33.537
Why don't you just call it Pat?
Then it's fine whatever it is.

04:33.620 --> 04:36.578
You can't call a baby Pat.
It's an auntie's name.

04:40.460 --> 04:44.738
Katie, love, could you
pass that fag for me? I can't...

04:46.000 --> 04:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:12.100 --> 05:14.568
Ah! It kicked!

05:14.660 --> 05:16.173
Can I feel it?

05:17.620 --> 05:19.451
Just there.

05:19.540 --> 05:21.053
Can I?

05:21.140 --> 05:22.619
It's amazing.

05:22.700 --> 05:23.655
Not now, Liam.

05:24.940 --> 05:26.168
What about Wolfgang?

05:26.260 --> 05:31.698
Get used to it, mate. It's going
to be baby, baby, baby from now on.

05:31.780 --> 05:34.089
< Or Eugene - that's a nice name.

05:34.180 --> 05:37.297
You can't call it Eugene.
Come on, Katie...

05:38.460 --> 05:39.734
Katie!

05:42.420 --> 05:44.092
Spit them out. Spit them out.

05:46.340 --> 05:48.854
Frank! Frank!

05:48.940 --> 05:50.373
Personal use, officer.

05:50.460 --> 05:51.449
Are these yours?

05:51.540 --> 05:52.097
What?

05:52.180 --> 05:54.853
The pills, the bloody pills.
Katie's had some.

05:54.940 --> 05:56.771
Oh, fucking hell!

05:56.860 --> 05:58.930
- What's going on?
- Call an ambulance.

06:02.260 --> 06:04.091
I'm dead. I'm so fucking dead!

06:04.180 --> 06:06.330
Maybe he'll bring it back.

06:06.420 --> 06:08.980
Two kilos of coke? I don't think so.

06:09.060 --> 06:09.572
Have you got his number or anything?

06:09.660 --> 06:11.412
Look, I'm not stupid!

06:11.500 --> 06:13.650
I don't know his number.
I don't know where he lives.

06:13.740 --> 06:16.095
I don't know what his shitting
star sign is. He's just a shag.

06:16.180 --> 06:17.135
Where did you meet him?

06:17.220 --> 06:18.494
Ancoats abattoir.

06:18.580 --> 06:20.138
You pulled in an abattoir?

06:20.220 --> 06:22.495
I got a puncture outside.
He was just knocking off.

06:22.580 --> 06:25.572
You know where he works?
We'll find him in the morning.

06:25.660 --> 06:26.695
We've lost the Friday pick-up.

06:26.780 --> 06:29.294
It's got to be cut, bagged
and shipped out for the weekend.

06:29.380 --> 06:32.133
Me dad's going to chop me bollocks off if I'm
not back tonight.

06:32.220 --> 06:35.576
If you've got any better ideas,
let's hear 'em.

06:37.500 --> 06:38.933
I'm going home.

06:39.020 --> 06:41.250
I'll see you in the morning.

06:41.340 --> 06:43.490
'Can someone
tell me what she's taken? '

06:43.580 --> 06:44.899
What the fuck were you thinking?

06:44.980 --> 06:45.935
It was an accident.

06:46.020 --> 06:46.930
Can everyone just calm down?

06:47.020 --> 06:49.295
It wasn't my fault!

06:49.380 --> 06:50.733
I'll kill him!

06:50.820 --> 06:52.856
Can someone please tell me
what she's taken?

06:52.940 --> 06:55.215
If anything happens to her,
you are dead, Frank. Dead.

06:55.300 --> 06:56.653
These aren't drugs.

06:56.740 --> 06:57.695
You what?

06:57.780 --> 06:59.179
They're mints, they're just mints.

06:59.260 --> 07:00.693
Are you sure?

07:00.780 --> 07:03.533
Yeah, travel mints. I've got
some in my glove compartment.

07:03.620 --> 07:04.575
Thank you, God.

07:04.660 --> 07:06.696
You stupid, stupid bastard!

07:06.780 --> 07:08.008
Look, there's no harm done.

07:08.100 --> 07:09.852
But you've got to be more careful.

07:09.940 --> 07:11.931
Next time,
you might not be so lucky.

07:12.020 --> 07:13.692
It's just a mix-up.
It won't happen again.

07:13.780 --> 07:16.658
He doesn't live here,
so we'll keep him out of the way.

07:16.740 --> 07:18.492
You what?

07:19.580 --> 07:21.536
Come on.

07:23.780 --> 07:25.657
Thanks again for everything.

07:25.740 --> 07:27.935
DOOR SHUTS

07:28.020 --> 07:31.171
What did you say that for?

07:31.260 --> 07:32.579
They could tell the Social.

07:32.660 --> 07:35.493
Don't be daft.
Like he said, there's no harm done.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.935
Only cos you've got ripped off.
What happens next time?

07:38.020 --> 07:39.851
I don't know. I'll be careful.

07:39.940 --> 07:40.929
That's reassuring(!)

07:41.020 --> 07:44.410
I can't have him under
the same roof as Katie.

07:46.460 --> 07:48.132
He's got to go.

07:48.220 --> 07:51.292
What fucking?

07:51.380 --> 07:53.450
Hold on, hold on.
If you look on the mat,

07:53.540 --> 07:56.054
you'll see a pile of bills there

07:56.140 --> 07:58.779
addressed to
Mr Vernon Francis Gallagher,

07:58.860 --> 08:02.136
not Mandy "Cuckoo in the nest" Maguire.
This is my home.

08:02.220 --> 08:04.290
No-one's telling me to leave.

08:05.980 --> 08:07.777
Am I right?

08:12.620 --> 08:16.010
Well, thank you
for your rousing vote of support(!)

08:16.100 --> 08:18.534
Can you blame them? You're not fit
to be around children.

08:18.620 --> 08:21.612
Go to your dad's house, cos
that's a drug-free zone, innit?

08:21.700 --> 08:24.373
- Piss off, Frank.
- OK, OK. I'll make this easy.

08:24.460 --> 08:26.371
Either she goes, or I do.

08:26.460 --> 08:28.530
I pay to live here.
That's more than you do.

08:28.620 --> 08:30.531
I'm talking to my family. Carl?

08:30.620 --> 08:31.655
You're out of order, Dad.

08:33.659 --> 08:34.615
Debbie?

08:34.700 --> 08:36.019
No-one's leaving.

08:36.100 --> 08:38.091
Least of all Mandy.

08:38.179 --> 08:42.219
Who do you think pays them bills
on the mat? She pays her way.

08:43.860 --> 08:47.375
Fucking...
Monica, you gonna back me up here?

08:47.460 --> 08:50.611
You owe Mandy an apology.

08:56.220 --> 08:58.211
I owe Mandy an apology.

09:01.260 --> 09:02.978
Right, go on. Out!

09:03.060 --> 09:04.857
Go on, all of you!

09:04.940 --> 09:09.058
Bunch of Judases.
Go on. Sling your hooks.

09:09.140 --> 09:11.017
I'm done with you.

09:32.460 --> 09:35.736
We've got two more waiting downstairs.

09:38.180 --> 09:39.135
Five minutes. All right?

09:39.220 --> 09:41.814
Try and get the money this time.

09:41.900 --> 09:43.333
Yeah, all right.

09:49.100 --> 09:50.613
Time's up, lover boy.

09:50.700 --> 09:51.655
Aye.

09:55.540 --> 09:57.337
Same time tomorrow?

09:57.420 --> 10:01.572
Listen, Kelly, I can't. I want to.
I really do, but I'm skint.

10:01.660 --> 10:03.890
I can't keep running up a tab.

10:03.980 --> 10:07.017
Tell you what, fix the bed for us,

10:07.100 --> 10:09.694
and I'll give you a freebie
tomorrow.

10:09.780 --> 10:11.054
It's not even broken.

10:19.420 --> 10:22.935
Can't work with a broken bed, can I?
I'll lose a fortune.

10:28.060 --> 10:32.850
Come on, have a heart, for old times'
sake. It's just for one night, Karen.

10:32.940 --> 10:34.419
You're not staying here.

10:34.500 --> 10:39.620
Have you heard about justice?
It's a matter of principle.

10:39.700 --> 10:42.772
Suffragettes, Nelson Mandela,
Bobby Sands. Ring any bells?

10:42.860 --> 10:45.897
Four hours shampooing the carpet
after the last time you stayed.

10:45.980 --> 10:47.413
Ring any bells?

10:49.300 --> 10:52.451
Hey, Gloria, there's not any chance
that I can?

10:55.220 --> 10:57.529
Bunty!

10:57.620 --> 10:58.575
Fuck off, Frank!

11:01.020 --> 11:04.376
Degs, Degs, Degsy, mate.

11:04.460 --> 11:05.939
I know it's been five years,

11:06.020 --> 11:09.057
and I know we didn't leave things
on the best terms, but...

11:09.140 --> 11:10.698
'Fuck off, Frank.'

11:27.580 --> 11:30.936
CAR ALARM WAILS, DOG BARKS

11:32.500 --> 11:34.616
TELEVISION BLARES

11:55.700 --> 11:56.815
Where did you go last night?

11:56.900 --> 11:57.855
Kipped at a mate's.

11:57.940 --> 12:00.408
You used to be a better liar.

12:00.500 --> 12:01.819
You used to be six.

12:01.900 --> 12:03.777
Just swallow your pride
and come home.

12:03.860 --> 12:06.420
I'll talk to Mandy,
but you have to apologise first.

12:06.500 --> 12:10.254
It's me that needs the apology,
and not just from her.

12:15.580 --> 12:18.174
Beware Greeks bearing lager.

12:18.260 --> 12:19.454
Come on, don't be daft.

12:19.540 --> 12:22.418
Oh, sorry for being cranky,
didn't sleep

12:22.500 --> 12:25.173
very well last night on account of
the knife in me back!

12:25.260 --> 12:28.058
Why not just come home? Say sorry
and we'll work it out.

12:28.140 --> 12:30.290
Have you ever heard of injustice?

12:30.380 --> 12:32.655
Have you ever heard of the Big Issue?

12:37.900 --> 12:40.619
Don't you worry.
I can look after meself!

12:49.660 --> 12:50.888
Liam!

12:50.980 --> 12:53.016
Can't find me goggles!

12:53.100 --> 12:56.297
Well, if you kept your stuff tidy,
you could find 'em!

13:00.580 --> 13:02.252
Mum, have you seen me goggles?

13:02.340 --> 13:05.332
No, love.
Listen, I'm really, really sorry,

13:05.420 --> 13:08.059
but would you mind
if I didn't come today?

13:08.140 --> 13:12.099
Only I'm feeling a bit... run down.

13:12.180 --> 13:13.738
But they're giving out prizes!

13:13.820 --> 13:15.378
Carl will go with you.

13:15.460 --> 13:18.179
- Mum, I'm going into town.
- Oh...

13:18.260 --> 13:20.171
All right, I'll drop him off.

13:20.260 --> 13:24.970
Listen, love. Just do your best
and tell me all about it later.

13:25.060 --> 13:26.857
Good luck!

13:28.540 --> 13:31.771
I've seen this before.
The baby taking over.

13:33.660 --> 13:35.616
This is the easy bit.

13:35.700 --> 13:37.770
Wait till they put a cot
next to your bed.

13:37.860 --> 13:39.657
Won't it go in with Mum?

13:39.740 --> 13:42.971
Think they'll put a baby
in the same room as Dad?

13:43.060 --> 13:44.778
No - it'll be in with us.

13:44.860 --> 13:48.614
Well, you. Cos once I get some money,
I'm out of here.

13:51.140 --> 13:53.574
Tell you something.

13:53.660 --> 13:58.654
Mum'll make you chuck half
your stuff before the baby comes.

13:58.740 --> 14:01.459
You don't know what women are like
with babies.

14:01.540 --> 14:03.019
They're mental.

14:03.100 --> 14:06.934
Cos you're the youngest,
Mum'll make you feed it,

14:07.020 --> 14:09.693
bath it, take it out for a walk,

14:09.780 --> 14:12.419
even change its nappies.

14:12.500 --> 14:16.379
I tell you, mate, you're going to
be a slave for the next few years.

14:19.100 --> 14:22.137
BABY'S CRY ECHOES

14:33.300 --> 14:34.733
Breakfast.

14:38.780 --> 14:40.577
Any sign yet?

14:40.660 --> 14:42.298
No, nothing yet.

14:44.620 --> 14:45.689
What?

14:45.780 --> 14:48.055
Just wondering how you
ever manage to pull.

14:48.140 --> 14:50.859
Skin-tight tops, works every time.

14:50.940 --> 14:54.649
We should go out together
on the pull. As a team, like.

14:57.540 --> 15:03.137
Pull anywhere, me. I've got
perfect, um, what do you call it?

15:03.220 --> 15:04.699
Gay-spotting vision thing.

15:06.140 --> 15:07.698
Right, watch this.

15:10.060 --> 15:12.016
Right, well, he's not.

15:14.860 --> 15:16.293
He's not.

15:18.980 --> 15:21.653
He's definitely not.

15:23.780 --> 15:25.179
He's not.

15:27.220 --> 15:29.688
He's not coming.

15:29.780 --> 15:31.896
We can't sell them
baking soda again.

15:31.980 --> 15:33.572
People are getting wise.

15:33.660 --> 15:35.571
Should have sent our Shane.

15:35.660 --> 15:38.094
You think Pongo'd
do better than Coco?

15:38.180 --> 15:39.852
Jesus!

15:39.940 --> 15:45.253
How did my golden bollocks
empty out those two fucking jokers?

15:45.340 --> 15:47.296
Don't look at me,
it's not all nature.

15:47.380 --> 15:50.895
There's a bit of nurture, too -
that's both of us.

15:50.980 --> 15:56.008
I don't think I'm to blame for Shane
falling for some scabby crack whore.

15:56.100 --> 15:59.331
And now he wants to bring her
to dinner, for Christ's sake.

16:10.380 --> 16:12.848
You've got to remember
you're a lot to live up to.

16:12.940 --> 16:15.374
They only want to please you.

16:16.980 --> 16:19.858
Show you they're up to snuff.

16:19.940 --> 16:24.650
Think about that.
Cut them a bit of slack, eh?

16:24.740 --> 16:27.937
Will you think about what I said,
look out for the boys?

16:29.780 --> 16:33.568
If Mickey's fucked this up...

16:33.660 --> 16:36.618
I will personally kneecap
the little gobshite.

16:46.140 --> 16:47.334
Bloody hell, Mickey!

16:47.420 --> 16:49.490
What? Got trapped bacon.

16:49.580 --> 16:51.093
Nice!

16:51.180 --> 16:53.853
There he is!

16:58.180 --> 16:59.249
Oi!

17:00.780 --> 17:02.372
Where's me bag?

17:02.460 --> 17:03.893
I lost it, I left it on a bus!

17:03.980 --> 17:04.969
Don't lie to me, arsehole!

17:05.060 --> 17:07.528
All right, all right!

17:07.619 --> 17:08.814
I've flogged it.

17:08.900 --> 17:11.334
For fuck's sake! Where's the money?

17:11.420 --> 17:13.775
I spent it. On these.

17:13.859 --> 17:15.976
Where's the rest?

17:16.060 --> 17:17.049
What do you mean?

17:17.140 --> 17:19.369
Those don't cost 20 fucking grand!

17:19.460 --> 17:22.930
20 grand? The lying bastards,
they gave me a hundred quid.

17:23.020 --> 17:25.579
You little dick,
I'll break both your arms!

17:25.660 --> 17:27.377
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

17:27.460 --> 17:29.769
Who did you sell it to?

17:29.860 --> 17:31.930
Eddie Rouse's youngest lads.

17:33.020 --> 17:34.658
Where can we find 'em?

17:36.540 --> 17:37.655
I don't know.

17:37.740 --> 17:39.651
Break his arm!

17:39.740 --> 17:43.255
All right, come on! 25...
What are you doing?

17:43.340 --> 17:44.898
Come on!

17:50.820 --> 17:52.458
That's it, yes!

18:03.220 --> 18:04.892
I love you.

18:08.380 --> 18:09.938
What did you just say?

18:15.740 --> 18:17.537
I don't know.

18:17.620 --> 18:20.054
"I love it" or something.
Pass us me fags.

18:20.140 --> 18:21.368
I thought you said...

18:21.460 --> 18:22.529
Fags.

18:24.220 --> 18:26.688
You know tomorrow?

18:26.780 --> 18:31.058
Instead of one hour, can I make
it two? Or three, for Sunday lunch?

18:34.780 --> 18:36.372
It'll cost you.

18:37.700 --> 18:42.012
Shall we say...
a shelf and a wardrobe?

18:44.780 --> 18:46.213
Deal.

18:52.220 --> 18:54.097
Look at the state of you.

18:55.700 --> 18:58.931
Some fucking protest.

18:59.020 --> 19:02.012
I bet Gandhi wasn't
covered in birdshit.

19:11.940 --> 19:15.933
Stick at it, kid -
you're right, they're wrong.

19:16.020 --> 19:17.658
So keep your dignity.

19:20.620 --> 19:22.053
Frank, you're barred!

19:22.140 --> 19:23.892
How many times?

19:23.980 --> 19:25.538
Hang on!

19:27.220 --> 19:28.369
Come on.

19:28.460 --> 19:30.371
BO YS LAUGH

19:41.180 --> 19:42.533
Do you want a chip?

19:45.780 --> 19:48.010
Go on, then.

19:54.500 --> 19:57.094
Oi, Granddad!

19:57.180 --> 19:58.579
Do you want a drink?

19:58.660 --> 20:00.890
Piss off and grow some pubes.

20:00.980 --> 20:05.610
I'm serious. I'll show you
where you can get some - for free.

20:05.700 --> 20:06.815
Yeah?

20:06.900 --> 20:08.015
Yeah.

20:16.940 --> 20:18.771
Fucking have these lads.

20:23.500 --> 20:24.455
What?

20:27.140 --> 20:29.096
Me mate wants a word.

20:31.820 --> 20:36.496
We're looking for a blue bag with
some stuff in it. Have you got it?

20:36.660 --> 20:37.854
If you've got 30 grand.

20:37.940 --> 20:40.010
30 grand, are you taking the piss?

20:44.260 --> 20:46.296
Right, that's it, we're telling
Paddy, he can take it from here.

20:46.380 --> 20:48.974
We're not telling him anything!

20:49.060 --> 20:52.496
Wait! Me dad's got some money
stashed in his bedroom.

20:52.580 --> 20:53.729
We can sneak in...

20:53.820 --> 20:56.209
Are you mental? Just tell your dad
you've been robbed by these blokes.

20:56.300 --> 20:58.052
We're not telling me dad!

20:58.140 --> 21:01.177
It's the first time he's let me do
the pick-up. I won't let him down!

21:01.260 --> 21:02.852
You already have!

21:02.940 --> 21:04.453
Aargh!

21:06.100 --> 21:06.930
Get a grip!

21:07.020 --> 21:09.739
You think I'm stupid!
Everybody does!

21:09.820 --> 21:13.529
You, me dad, everyone!

21:13.620 --> 21:15.372
Well... piss off!

21:15.460 --> 21:17.530
Just piss off!

21:17.620 --> 21:19.372
MOBILE PHONE RINGS

21:28.620 --> 21:29.769
TV IS ON

21:31.380 --> 21:32.813
Knock, knock.

21:34.540 --> 21:36.098
How was swimming?

21:36.180 --> 21:38.011
I got third place.

21:38.100 --> 21:40.011
Oh, never mind!

21:43.220 --> 21:47.532
Listen, I know Mummy's been
a bit tired lately,

21:47.620 --> 21:50.976
but that's because Mummy's body's
going through lots of changes.

21:51.060 --> 21:52.288
It'll all be worth it,

21:52.380 --> 21:55.690
cos soon, we'll have a lovely
new baby in the house.

21:55.780 --> 21:57.577
Won't that be exciting?

21:57.660 --> 22:00.493
Feeding, walks, nappy changes,

22:00.580 --> 22:04.175
there'll be lots of things
to do every day.

22:04.260 --> 22:08.492
Cos it's not just me having this baby,
you know - it's you, too.

22:27.620 --> 22:28.735
SNORING

22:28.820 --> 22:31.209
There you go, free booze!

22:31.300 --> 22:33.177
Ha-ha, very funny(!)

22:33.260 --> 22:35.649
Eh, I'll give you a fiver
if you twat him.

22:35.740 --> 22:38.174
Fuck off!

22:38.260 --> 22:40.455
Bring back National Service.

22:41.260 --> 22:44.172
Oi, mate, give you a fiver
if you batter this bloke.

22:44.260 --> 22:45.488
Fuck off!

22:46.580 --> 22:50.016
Oh my God. Look at that!
Look at him.

23:02.580 --> 23:05.652
Are you getting all this?
You getting it all?

23:08.020 --> 23:09.658
Go on!

23:09.740 --> 23:11.731
Come on, you started it!

23:11.820 --> 23:13.333
Fucking hit him!

23:13.420 --> 23:17.015
Oi, Granddad!
Do you want a fiver or yer shoe?

23:17.100 --> 23:19.330
Go on, go on!

23:21.180 --> 23:22.772
All right, fuck off.

23:22.860 --> 23:24.498
School's out, I'm off!

23:24.580 --> 23:26.013
Faggot.

23:31.460 --> 23:33.815
Unless youse wanna see
some happy knee-capping,

23:33.900 --> 23:35.697
I'd get going right now!

23:41.180 --> 23:43.171
Thanks.

23:43.260 --> 23:45.615
I didn't do it for you.

23:45.700 --> 23:49.739
It's bad for business having
little shites like that on your turf.

23:49.820 --> 23:52.254
Talking of which,
have you seen Mickey?

23:52.340 --> 23:54.251
No... Yeah, I've seen him.

23:54.340 --> 23:56.137
Where?

23:57.460 --> 23:59.530
Maybe a tenner would help me
remember.

23:59.620 --> 24:03.898
All right! I haven't seen him,
I haven't seen him!

24:08.620 --> 24:12.454
Jesus, Frank, look at the state of you.

24:12.540 --> 24:15.577
Go home, take a bath.

24:15.660 --> 24:17.457
You stink.

24:20.100 --> 24:23.217
I'm making a stand.

24:26.420 --> 24:28.695
(I'm making a stand.)

24:48.420 --> 24:50.251
Can I help you, love?

24:50.340 --> 24:51.534
I'm waiting for me dad.

24:51.620 --> 24:53.053
Oh.

24:53.140 --> 24:55.449
Well, he's...

24:55.540 --> 24:56.734
He won't be in today.

24:56.820 --> 24:57.969
Why not?

24:58.060 --> 24:59.812
He's barred, love.

25:01.420 --> 25:05.049
Sorry. Hey...
Shall we get you some crisps?

25:06.660 --> 25:08.537
What flavour do you want?

25:40.980 --> 25:43.858
(Paddy) This is a real fucking mess. >

25:43.940 --> 25:45.658
(Mimi) Who are you gonna go to? >

25:45.740 --> 25:46.855
Big Keith.

25:46.940 --> 25:48.578
I thought he was inside.

25:48.660 --> 25:50.218
Well, he got out last month.

25:51.820 --> 25:53.697
I don't trust him.

25:53.780 --> 25:56.453
Well, beggars can't be
choosers, darling.

25:57.780 --> 26:00.010
We're not gonna make on this.

26:00.100 --> 26:03.456
I'd rather lose money than customers.

26:03.540 --> 26:06.850
I mean, fucking Mickey!
Where did we go wrong with him, eh?

26:06.940 --> 26:09.500
He's unreliable,
he's got shite for brains,

26:09.580 --> 26:12.856
and he hangs around in that pink
poof's palace like a little girl!

26:12.940 --> 26:16.296
And before you say anything,
I <i>am</i> trying

26:16.380 --> 26:17.574
to be a more supportive father,

26:17.660 --> 26:20.857
but it's pretty fucking difficult
at the moment!

26:22.540 --> 26:24.656
Maybe there's something I can do.

26:26.260 --> 26:31.459
To help you... unwind,
get things in perspective.

26:40.540 --> 26:41.734
ZIP OPENS

26:45.220 --> 26:46.573
COINS JANGLE

26:49.980 --> 26:51.857
(Paddy) A-hem! Good evening, officer(!)

27:14.220 --> 27:15.653
KNOCK ON DOOR

27:20.460 --> 27:21.973
Can I come in?

27:22.060 --> 27:23.015
I'm busy.

27:23.100 --> 27:25.375
Ta.

27:29.220 --> 27:30.653
Did you get the money, then?

27:32.260 --> 27:34.694
Don't ask.

27:34.780 --> 27:37.294
So what's your plan?

27:37.380 --> 27:38.813
I dunno.

27:40.540 --> 27:41.973
I think...

27:43.660 --> 27:45.139
I need your help.

27:47.260 --> 27:49.820
Right, you try and twat me,

27:49.900 --> 27:51.970
then you tell me to piss off,

27:52.060 --> 27:53.971
and now I'm supposed to help ya?

27:54.060 --> 27:57.177
Don't you think you'd better
say something first?

28:00.260 --> 28:01.898
I'm unreliable.

28:03.540 --> 28:05.576
I've got shit for brains.

28:07.660 --> 28:12.256
I hide away like a little girl
at the slightest sign of trouble.

28:12.340 --> 28:15.855
I drive around in a poof's palace.

28:15.940 --> 28:19.774
And I'm no kind of man.

28:19.860 --> 28:22.090
I were just looking for a "sorry".

28:25.580 --> 28:28.458
Come on, mate, do you want a brew?

28:33.500 --> 28:36.378
RAIN PATTERS

28:53.260 --> 28:54.852
Where's the rest?

28:54.940 --> 28:58.489
A couple of the girls got thrush,
it puts the punters right off.

29:00.580 --> 29:02.889
Maybe you can get your Shane
to pay his tab.

29:02.980 --> 29:04.618
Shane's got a tab?

29:04.700 --> 29:05.815
Three grand.

29:10.460 --> 29:11.893
You, out, now.

29:17.100 --> 29:18.692
What are you doing with my son?

29:18.780 --> 29:20.338
He's a punter.

29:20.420 --> 29:23.378
A punter with a rich daddy
who could pay off his debts.

29:23.460 --> 29:25.018
What? No!

29:25.100 --> 29:27.933
Listen, I've run a thousand con tricks,
so don't kid a kidder.

29:28.020 --> 29:29.419
What are you on about?

29:29.500 --> 29:32.458
This meet-the-parents
Sunday-lunch bollocks tomorrow.

29:32.540 --> 29:35.418
Shane's not exactly
the brightest tool in the box,

29:35.500 --> 29:38.333
but he can still do better than you.

29:38.420 --> 29:42.652
A hooker... with a smack addiction.

29:42.740 --> 29:44.776
Not exactly a catch, are you?

29:47.620 --> 29:49.895
So here's what's gonna happen.

29:51.180 --> 29:53.614
You're gonna take this...

29:55.860 --> 29:57.293
...and fuck off!

29:58.900 --> 30:03.530
Or so help me, I will end... you.

30:17.140 --> 30:18.892
It looks like there's no-one in.

30:24.940 --> 30:26.737
Have you found it yet?

30:26.820 --> 30:28.333
No!

30:30.620 --> 30:32.053
Come on!

30:38.580 --> 30:39.615
Got it!

30:41.100 --> 30:42.135
Shit.

30:46.620 --> 30:48.656
Come here, you bastards!

30:48.740 --> 30:50.537
Shit!

30:50.620 --> 30:52.770
lan, wait!

30:52.860 --> 30:54.771
Aaaah!

30:57.300 --> 30:58.733
Aaaah!

31:06.900 --> 31:10.210
- Mickey! Mickey!
- I'm gonna fucking kill you!

31:10.300 --> 31:12.814
- Mickey!
- Aaaah!

31:16.860 --> 31:18.293
Aaaah!

31:28.620 --> 31:30.338
I can't believe you just did that.

31:30.420 --> 31:33.139
Neither can I.

31:33.220 --> 31:35.370
Thanks, mate. Seriously.

31:39.300 --> 31:41.097
Listen, I'm not going home.

31:41.180 --> 31:43.648
Are you all right to walk from here?

31:43.740 --> 31:46.812
If you run off, you'll just be
proving your dad right.

31:46.900 --> 31:50.176
I already have! Why do you think
he doesn't let me in on the business?

31:50.260 --> 31:51.488
Cos of fuck-ups like this!

31:51.580 --> 31:54.094
Look at what you've done
in the past 24 hours -

31:54.180 --> 31:58.970
intimidation, breaking and entering,
risking your life for a bag of drugs.

31:59.060 --> 32:01.813
You're a proper Maguire!
Stand up to your dad!

32:05.700 --> 32:07.099
I can't.

32:08.860 --> 32:10.293
I just can't.

32:12.580 --> 32:13.854
Mickey...

32:13.940 --> 32:15.532
I'm sorry.

32:17.020 --> 32:18.089
Mickey!

32:20.620 --> 32:22.258
Where have you been?

32:22.340 --> 32:27.539
I've been staying at a mate's,
big luxury flat in Salford Quays.

32:27.620 --> 32:31.772
Massive telly, surround sound,
bidet, the works.

32:31.860 --> 32:34.738
Can I stay there, too?

32:34.820 --> 32:36.094
You?

32:36.180 --> 32:37.659
What for?

32:37.740 --> 32:39.173
I've run away.

32:41.220 --> 32:43.256
Oh, right.

32:43.340 --> 32:46.332
Well, I don't think
there's enough room for both of us,

32:46.420 --> 32:48.854
so you should probably be
getting back home.

32:48.940 --> 32:50.089
I'm not going home.

32:50.180 --> 32:51.374
Liam, you're seven.

32:51.460 --> 32:54.611
Eight and a half,
and I'm not going back!

32:54.700 --> 32:57.612
All right, all right!
Chill your boots.

33:00.180 --> 33:01.533
So what's your plan, then?

33:01.620 --> 33:02.689
I've got a tent.

33:02.780 --> 33:05.214
Don't know how to put it up, though.

33:09.380 --> 33:14.135
Well, I suppose I could hang around
for a bit, help you put it up.

33:14.220 --> 33:15.653
Do you know how?

33:15.740 --> 33:18.493
I'm an adventurer, Liam.

33:18.580 --> 33:21.538
Before you lot was born,
I was sleeping under the stars,

33:21.620 --> 33:23.019
catching rabbits in traps,

33:23.100 --> 33:25.489
making fires
by rubbing two sticks together.

33:25.580 --> 33:27.138
You can make a fire?

33:29.540 --> 33:34.898
Yeah, yeah, well, if I had some
dry wood or kindling, I could show you.

33:37.780 --> 33:39.054
Can we buy some?

33:42.340 --> 33:43.932
Yeah, come on.

33:53.100 --> 33:54.692
Night, Liam.

34:02.860 --> 34:05.135
SIRENS WAIL

34:09.980 --> 34:11.777
Can I have a taste of your lager?

34:11.860 --> 34:13.293
BURPS

34:17.900 --> 34:19.333
BURPS

34:24.659 --> 34:26.139
Have you got any Es? >

34:26.219 --> 34:28.529
No. Have you?

34:28.620 --> 34:30.292
No.

34:30.380 --> 34:32.371
Could I have some if you did?

34:32.460 --> 34:35.054
Not till you're 12, son,
not till you're 12.

34:47.020 --> 34:49.136
I suppose...

34:49.219 --> 34:52.098
I'd better be getting back
to me mate's.

34:52.179 --> 34:54.136
You can stop here if you like.

34:55.900 --> 34:57.333
Um...

34:59.540 --> 35:03.738
Well, I suppose he won't miss me
for one night, will he?

35:03.820 --> 35:05.173
Nah.

35:15.700 --> 35:17.179
Party.

35:17.260 --> 35:19.728
LAUGHS

35:20.940 --> 35:22.896
I think we've got a problem.

35:29.660 --> 35:31.537
CHUCKLES

35:35.020 --> 35:38.330
Liam! Liam!

35:39.700 --> 35:42.339
How could you not notice
he weren't in his room?

35:42.420 --> 35:43.455
It were dark.

35:43.540 --> 35:44.655
There's no sign of him anywhere.

35:44.740 --> 35:46.651
I'll check the swings.

35:46.740 --> 35:49.015
You check his mates' houses and
we'll meet back at ours in an hour.

35:49.100 --> 35:50.613
Right.

35:51.420 --> 35:52.819
Liam!

35:54.740 --> 35:57.129
'You have 16 new messages.'

35:57.220 --> 35:58.255
BEEP

35:58.340 --> 36:01.571
(PADD Y) 'We need to get cracking,
Mickey, hurry up.'

36:01.660 --> 36:03.571
'Where the hell are you, Mickey? '

36:03.660 --> 36:06.732
'You'd better get back here
in the next 10 minutes... '

36:06.820 --> 36:09.937
'Mickey, it's Mum.
Listen, I don't know where you are,

36:10.020 --> 36:12.978
'but do us a favour
and let us know you're all right.

36:13.060 --> 36:16.052
'I'm worried sick here.
We both are.

36:16.140 --> 36:18.290
'Love you. Bye.'

36:22.460 --> 36:23.893
(Liam) I'm not going back.

36:23.980 --> 36:26.414
I ran away from home once,
about your age.

36:28.420 --> 36:30.251
Wasn't as smart as you, though.

36:30.340 --> 36:31.932
Didn't bring my own tent.

36:32.020 --> 36:35.535
Ended up kipping in the back
of the neighbour's Vauxhall Viva.

36:35.620 --> 36:38.657
Woke up in Norfolk the next morning.
Have you ever been?

36:38.740 --> 36:40.935
- No.
- Don't bother.

36:41.020 --> 36:43.375
Very flat, Norfolk.

36:43.460 --> 36:45.098
Very backward people.

36:45.180 --> 36:47.136
Probably still using Betamax.

36:51.300 --> 36:52.972
So why did you run away anyway?

36:53.060 --> 36:56.973
- I don't want the baby.
- That makes two of us.

36:57.060 --> 36:58.493
Why are you having it, then?

36:58.580 --> 37:00.093
SIGHS

37:00.180 --> 37:04.378
Son, when you have 'em...

37:04.460 --> 37:08.055
lickle babies...

37:08.140 --> 37:10.893
you love 'em.

37:10.980 --> 37:13.494
Even if they're real mingers.

37:13.580 --> 37:17.175
I mean, when lan was born,
he came out looking like David Gest.

37:20.260 --> 37:21.454
Really?

37:21.540 --> 37:25.328
Yeah. God's honest truth.

37:25.420 --> 37:29.936
And if you have a younger brother
or sister, well, that's a bonus, innit?

37:30.020 --> 37:31.248
Why?

37:31.340 --> 37:34.571
Well, you'll always have someone
to batter around when you're annoyed

37:34.660 --> 37:37.128
and someone whose
pocket money you can nick.

37:37.220 --> 37:39.859
But Carl said I'll have to
look after it and stuff.

37:39.940 --> 37:41.373
Look after it?

37:41.460 --> 37:44.099
With all them women about?

37:44.180 --> 37:47.013
Apart from your mam and Debbie,
there's loads of 'em.

37:47.100 --> 37:50.251
You want to see how women behave
when there's babies around.

37:50.340 --> 37:54.652
You won't have to do a bloody thing.
Neither of us will.

37:54.740 --> 37:56.173
But it'll be in my room.

37:56.260 --> 37:59.616
Nah, not for years yet.

37:59.700 --> 38:02.294
I tell you who will be
in your room though - me.

38:02.380 --> 38:05.656
Ever tried kipping next to a baby?

38:05.740 --> 38:07.810
Noisy little bastards.

38:07.900 --> 38:13.099
HE IMITATES A SHEEP

38:13.780 --> 38:14.849
Die, bitch.

38:14.940 --> 38:17.295
It'll take more than you, limp dick.

38:17.380 --> 38:18.335
LAUGHS

38:23.540 --> 38:26.930
Oh, look who's here.
It's the return of the prodigal twat.

38:27.020 --> 38:30.251
I've got summat to say.
I need you to listen.

38:30.340 --> 38:32.331
You're always worth listening to,
son, that's part of your charm.

38:32.420 --> 38:34.615
Just shut it, will ya?

38:34.700 --> 38:36.770
Shut it and listen to me.

38:40.460 --> 38:42.530
I know you think I'm a twat, but...

38:42.620 --> 38:47.410
I've worked my arse off
the last two days

38:47.500 --> 38:48.694
risking me life,

38:48.780 --> 38:53.376
seeing things no-one should ever see.

38:53.460 --> 38:55.690
MIMI MOANING

38:55.780 --> 38:57.452
I'm tryin'.

38:57.540 --> 39:02.216
I do me best and sometimes,
best in't good enough.

39:07.780 --> 39:09.657
I've lost your fuckin' coke.

39:11.020 --> 39:15.252
I haven't sold it, I wasn't robbed,
I fuckin' lost it.

39:16.540 --> 39:19.418
I made a mistake.

39:19.500 --> 39:22.856
I know what you have to do.

39:25.260 --> 39:26.852
I'm making it easy.

39:29.100 --> 39:32.570
I'm going, for good.

39:35.820 --> 39:38.937
I won't embarrass you any more.

39:39.020 --> 39:40.851
I'm off.

39:40.940 --> 39:44.489
You lose my coke and think
you can walk away? ...Wait.

39:48.620 --> 39:51.259
Do I scare you that much?

40:01.340 --> 40:02.932
You're our boy,

40:03.020 --> 40:04.453
our baby.

40:05.540 --> 40:06.609
Blood is...

40:08.380 --> 40:11.770
...thicker than a bag
of fucking chemicals, son,

40:11.860 --> 40:13.373
even if they are worth a...

40:22.420 --> 40:24.729
This is family, Mickey.

40:24.820 --> 40:26.378
You don't walk away from it.

40:26.460 --> 40:29.099
You can't.

40:29.180 --> 40:31.296
And even if you ever do,

40:31.380 --> 40:34.895
it'll still be there, waiting,

40:34.980 --> 40:36.857
for when you decide to come back.

40:39.460 --> 40:41.974
There's nothing you can do

40:42.060 --> 40:43.891
to stop you being our son.

40:43.980 --> 40:47.655
(Mimi) That's your dad's way
of saying we love ya.

40:47.740 --> 40:49.219
Steady on there, Mimi.

40:49.300 --> 40:50.813
Don't go spoiling the boy.

40:52.940 --> 40:54.214
What?

40:54.300 --> 40:56.018
I've lost your money.

41:00.020 --> 41:02.898
Obviously, you will have to pay me back.

41:02.980 --> 41:06.370
But we'll work out a payment plan...

41:08.180 --> 41:09.613
...if you stay.

41:15.740 --> 41:17.059
Good.

41:17.140 --> 41:20.576
Now piss off and let me thrash
your mother at Blade Killer 7,

41:20.660 --> 41:22.969
or whatever it's called.

41:23.060 --> 41:26.336
Unless there's anything else
you wish to get off your chest.

41:28.820 --> 41:32.415
Mum, Dad...

41:34.940 --> 41:37.534
I'm gay.

41:38.660 --> 41:42.096
LAUGHS

41:47.300 --> 41:49.939
(On computer game) 'Round two, fight.'

41:54.300 --> 41:55.528
Die, bitch.

42:04.220 --> 42:06.575
- Shane.
- Are you ready, then?

42:09.180 --> 42:10.295
I'm not coming.

42:10.380 --> 42:12.814
A mate of mine's opening a place in Malaga
and she's offering me some work.

42:12.900 --> 42:16.449
How long for?
When are you coming back?

42:16.540 --> 42:18.610
There's nothing to keep me here.

42:20.460 --> 42:22.257
What about the last few weeks?

42:22.340 --> 42:24.012
I've been playing you.

42:24.100 --> 42:26.568
You what?

42:28.620 --> 42:30.770
I was getting you into debt

42:30.860 --> 42:32.930
so I could sting
your dad for the money.

42:34.780 --> 42:36.372
You said you loved me.

42:40.420 --> 42:41.933
I say that to everyone.

42:44.380 --> 42:46.052
It's me job.

42:57.300 --> 42:59.336
DOOR SHUTS

43:08.740 --> 43:10.492
Probably for the best, love.

43:10.580 --> 43:15.495
Your mother's right.
It would never have worked.

43:15.580 --> 43:17.650
You wouldn't have been able
to kiss her without...

43:17.740 --> 43:19.696
thinking about what
she'd choked on at work.

43:19.780 --> 43:22.135
Paddy, give him a break.

43:22.220 --> 43:24.176
I'm sodding starving, me.

43:27.380 --> 43:28.813
Where's Kelly?

43:29.940 --> 43:31.612
Fuck off!

43:32.460 --> 43:36.294
Will you just fuck off?
Fuck right off!

43:38.460 --> 43:40.451
For what we are about to receive,

43:40.540 --> 43:43.976
may the Lord make us
truly thankful. Amen.

43:44.060 --> 43:45.937
She dumped him?

43:47.300 --> 43:48.574
Yes.

43:48.660 --> 43:51.174
Fuckin' hell, how do you
get dumped off a prozzie?

43:51.260 --> 43:53.410
Ah!

43:53.500 --> 43:57.891
Right, we'll have no more talk
about workers in the..."sex industry".

43:57.980 --> 44:02.371
We're here to have a happy,
family Sunday. Got that?

44:02.460 --> 44:04.337
SOBS

44:04.420 --> 44:07.218
I'm going out for another look.

44:07.300 --> 44:09.530
Just wait until you've eaten
and then we'll all go.

44:15.700 --> 44:17.691
Brought something for ya.

44:22.380 --> 44:24.974
Oh, thank you, Lord.

44:25.060 --> 44:28.257
We can't have the lickle lad
roaming the streets, can we?

44:28.340 --> 44:29.534
Where did you find him?

44:29.620 --> 44:31.417
You just need to know
where to look, that's all.

44:31.500 --> 44:33.092
Nice one, Dad.

44:34.300 --> 44:35.733
Come here!

44:37.540 --> 44:38.893
Let's take this off.

44:43.580 --> 44:44.535
You all right?

44:44.620 --> 44:47.054
- (Liam) Yeah.
- I'd best be off.

44:47.140 --> 44:50.337
I only came to bring Liam back.

44:53.220 --> 44:56.292
Do you want a brew?
There's one going spare.

44:59.220 --> 45:03.691
Don't know. Depends on what
you've all got to say to me first.

45:14.180 --> 45:16.171
Fine. I accept your apology.

45:24.340 --> 45:26.808
Is there any chance
of a bite to eat or what?

45:28.460 --> 45:30.690
(lan) 'Don't know if I ever
want to be a dad.

45:30.780 --> 45:33.658
'Some people say it's the best
thing they've ever done,

45:33.740 --> 45:36.129
'made their life complete
and all that.

45:36.220 --> 45:37.938
'Maybe it did.

45:38.020 --> 45:40.659
'Or maybe they just had
really boring lives.'

45:43.140 --> 45:44.289
What?

45:44.380 --> 45:46.974
