00:22.526 --> 00:24.527
All right, girls. To the barre.

00:33.303 --> 00:34.703
Today, we're going to try a pirouette.

00:36.072 --> 00:38.102
Start from first, and...

00:38.341 --> 00:40.609
Tendu. Prepare.

00:40.644 --> 00:42.978
Pirouette. Fifth and close.

00:43.013 --> 00:44.580
Perfect, Katie.

00:44.614 --> 00:45.881
The rest of you are close.

00:45.916 --> 00:47.483
Tandy, focus.

00:47.517 --> 00:48.717
Let's try again.

00:48.752 --> 00:50.386
First positions.

01:03.333 --> 01:04.533
You sure it's the same guy?

01:04.568 --> 01:06.669
Yeah, I'm sure it's
the same system we put in.

01:06.703 --> 01:07.736
Heard that a block away.

01:07.771 --> 01:09.572
So, how we gonna get it back?

01:09.606 --> 01:10.673
Get what back?

01:11.875 --> 01:13.442
We installed a car stereo,

01:13.476 --> 01:14.743
and the rich prick stiffed us on it.

01:14.778 --> 01:15.978
Ty, is that my hoodie?

01:16.012 --> 01:17.913
It was in my room.

01:17.948 --> 01:19.615
So, what we gonna do?

01:19.649 --> 01:21.584
Look, little man, you know
how Mom and Pops are.

01:21.618 --> 01:23.519
It's starting to rain.
You need to get home.

01:33.663 --> 01:35.064
See ya, Tandy. Hi, Mom!

01:48.645 --> 01:50.012
Research and Development, please.

01:51.848 --> 01:53.582
Nathan Bowen's office, please.

01:54.885 --> 01:56.585
Hi, Daddy.

01:56.620 --> 01:58.420
All right, look, I'll pop the lock.

01:58.455 --> 02:00.322
You slide out our B&O. No big.

02:00.357 --> 02:01.790
They call it "grand theft auto."

02:01.825 --> 02:03.492
Grand literally means "big."

02:03.526 --> 02:05.160
Hey, man, we're just
taking back what's ours.

02:05.195 --> 02:06.695
- Yeah.
- So let's go to the cops.

02:06.730 --> 02:08.797
The cops? Yeah, right.

02:08.832 --> 02:10.666
- Come on, man.
- Look, what are you so afraid of?

02:12.602 --> 02:13.669
If I get in trouble again,

02:13.703 --> 02:15.971
my pops is gonna beat the black off me.

02:16.006 --> 02:17.439
Looks like he already did, B.

02:20.744 --> 02:21.911
Yo, whatever, man.

02:23.813 --> 02:25.014
Yo!

02:38.194 --> 02:40.496
Tendu. Pirouette.

02:43.366 --> 02:45.834
Tendu. Pirouette.

02:50.573 --> 02:52.441
Get in here, you waterlogged pumpkin.

02:54.210 --> 02:55.411
Quick, quick.

02:57.080 --> 02:58.614
Close that.

02:58.648 --> 02:59.848
Let's go.

03:18.068 --> 03:19.301
What happened to Mama?

03:21.171 --> 03:22.771
I think her back is still hurting.

03:22.806 --> 03:23.973
How was practice?

03:24.007 --> 03:25.341
Did you chop a board in half?

03:25.375 --> 03:27.376
That's karate, not ballet.

03:27.410 --> 03:28.911
That's right.

03:29.980 --> 03:32.014
Is her back ever going to get better?

03:32.048 --> 03:33.549
She's been taking a lot of pills.

03:34.718 --> 03:36.452
Look, we're all gonna be okay.

03:37.687 --> 03:38.721
I gotta take this.

03:38.755 --> 03:40.089
It's work.

03:40.123 --> 03:41.457
Nathan Bowen.

04:02.345 --> 04:03.645
Ty, what are you still doing out, man?

04:05.048 --> 04:06.915
You said you were scared,

04:06.950 --> 04:08.384
so I thought I'd do it for you.

04:10.720 --> 04:11.987
So, you thugging now?

04:13.223 --> 04:14.590
What? You feel like a big man now?

04:14.624 --> 04:15.824
No.

04:17.627 --> 04:18.827
I just feel scared.

04:26.469 --> 04:28.303
Look, man, we're gonna go
take this back, okay?

04:36.579 --> 04:37.913
Don't move.

04:40.517 --> 04:41.617
Run!

04:48.058 --> 04:49.224
If you shut the rig down,

04:49.259 --> 04:50.893
three very bad things
are going to happen.

04:50.927 --> 04:52.861
Number one, structural collapse.

04:52.896 --> 04:54.329
And when the legs buckle,

04:54.364 --> 04:55.631
and the hull hits the water,

04:55.665 --> 04:56.732
that'll cause number two.

04:56.766 --> 04:59.034
A very large explosion.

04:59.069 --> 05:01.503
And those two, they don't
even compare to number three.

05:01.538 --> 05:03.872
Complete energy dispersion.
Are you following?

05:06.176 --> 05:07.409
Come on, come on!

05:13.683 --> 05:15.250
Come on, let's go!

05:18.555 --> 05:20.089
181, we're code six

05:20.123 --> 05:23.058
with two suspects. Possible 459.

05:23.093 --> 05:25.627
There's confidential,
but there's also negligent.

05:26.696 --> 05:28.497
If this rig goes...

05:28.531 --> 05:30.299
With all due respect, sir,

05:30.333 --> 05:31.346
I think it's time

05:31.370 --> 05:32.835
that we call in the government.

05:32.836 --> 05:34.303
Are...

05:39.008 --> 05:41.543
Daddy!

05:49.085 --> 05:50.452
Come on. Come on, come on.

05:53.590 --> 05:54.890
Stay there.

05:56.860 --> 05:58.260
Freeze!

05:59.496 --> 06:01.230
- Where's the other one?
- He didn't do nothing!

06:01.264 --> 06:02.798
We were just taking this back. I swear!

06:13.943 --> 06:15.444

06:34.430 --> 06:36.365

What about our insurance?

19:00.029 --> 19:01.396
It's through the company.

19:01.459 --> 19:02.659
And the house?

19:02.740 --> 19:03.940
I'll find out what I can.

19:04.015 --> 19:05.749
What do we do in the meantime?

19:07.885 --> 19:09.653
Just stay strong, okay?

19:30.308 --> 19:31.975
How'd we do?

19:32.009 --> 19:34.177
- We got five hundred.
- Five hundred?

19:34.212 --> 19:36.580
No, Liam, there's gotta be more.

19:36.614 --> 19:37.814
That was a diamond necklace!

19:37.849 --> 19:41.218
Yeah, well, owner said that
the diamond had micro-etching.

19:41.252 --> 19:44.121
- Makes it traceable.
- What about the ballet tickets?

19:44.155 --> 19:47.524
That's $400 times two times a
seasonal series of seven shows.

19:47.558 --> 19:49.960
Well, they're useless in a week.
They get new barcodes.

19:52.997 --> 19:54.865
Micro-etching?

19:54.899 --> 19:56.333
That's not a thing. You got played!

19:56.367 --> 19:58.101
What's going on with you?

19:59.103 --> 20:00.137
Just hoping for more.

20:01.139 --> 20:02.672
You need to blow off some steam.

20:02.707 --> 20:04.274
I need to steal more shit.

20:05.443 --> 20:07.711
Okay, I hear there's this
party in the woods.

20:07.745 --> 20:08.912
It's supposed to be pretty big.

20:25.263 --> 20:27.664
Tyrone. Tyrone! Hey.

20:27.698 --> 20:29.399
Hey, Evita.

20:29.433 --> 20:31.601
The squad is throwing a party
tonight in Culper Woods

20:31.636 --> 20:33.136
to celebrate you guys making State,

20:33.171 --> 20:34.437
and the rest of the girls

20:34.472 --> 20:35.705
made me promise to get you there.

20:35.740 --> 20:36.940
They did?

20:36.974 --> 20:38.108
Give me your phone.

20:38.142 --> 20:40.810
My phone?

20:41.879 --> 20:44.080
Look, after the game and everything...

20:44.115 --> 20:45.815
Give me your phone.

20:49.287 --> 20:51.890
Okay. Here's my number,

20:51.961 --> 20:54.394
and a GPS pin for the party,

20:54.432 --> 20:56.433
and here are a bunch of emojis

20:56.474 --> 20:58.241
that don't actually mean anything,

20:58.269 --> 21:01.071
but should remind
you that I'm a human being

21:01.105 --> 21:02.672
who you will let down if you flake.

21:03.674 --> 21:05.775
- You got it?
- I do. Yeah.

21:06.877 --> 21:08.411
Just, um...

21:09.480 --> 21:11.247
why you? Specifically?

21:12.483 --> 21:13.783
Emojis.

21:35.773 --> 21:36.973
Hello?

21:39.110 --> 21:40.410
Anybody home?

21:42.046 --> 21:43.213
Anybody drunk?

21:44.281 --> 21:45.682
Passed out?

21:45.716 --> 21:47.317
All of the above?

22:52.865 --> 22:54.099
<i>♪ Wait on it ♪</i>

22:54.124 --> 22:56.025
<i>♪ Everybody watching while

23:23.013 --> 23:26.950
Jesus! I'm sorry.

23:26.984 --> 23:30.220
I had a day, and it's possible
I started this party too early.

23:30.254 --> 23:31.821
Yeah, you don't say.

23:31.856 --> 23:33.790
Your jacket. Is it ruined?

23:34.992 --> 23:37.894
No. Noah, truth be told,
I never wear this thing.

23:39.063 --> 23:41.397
Probably use a little more
high school experience on it.

23:45.903 --> 23:47.403
Well, you should wear it more often.

23:48.572 --> 23:49.973
Hangs nicely off your shoulders.

23:50.007 --> 23:51.274
Thanks.

23:55.513 --> 23:56.846
What's your name?

23:56.881 --> 23:58.414
Tandy.

24:01.085 --> 24:03.253
Did you know my dad named me
after his first computer?

24:03.287 --> 24:04.921
I did not.

24:04.955 --> 24:06.723
Hand to God. How 'bout you?

24:06.757 --> 24:08.191
My mother's grandfather.

24:08.225 --> 24:10.393
And his name was?

24:10.427 --> 24:12.629
Uh, yeah.

24:12.663 --> 24:14.364
Yeah, Tyrone.

24:17.635 --> 24:19.302
Well, Tyrone...

24:19.336 --> 24:20.403
this thing is useless,

24:20.437 --> 24:22.338
so I'm gonna go get some proper towels.

24:22.373 --> 24:24.841
Something a little more "absorbating."

24:24.875 --> 24:25.975
Absorbative.

24:27.244 --> 24:28.912
Yeah. I'd appreciate that.

24:28.946 --> 24:30.046
Okay.

24:33.851 --> 24:34.884
Tyrone!

24:34.919 --> 24:36.853
Hey, you made it!

24:36.887 --> 24:38.254
Emojis.

24:38.289 --> 24:39.989
They... they, uh, they hold power.

24:41.759 --> 24:43.726
Come on. Buy a girl a beer.

24:43.761 --> 24:45.662
- That much power? Huh?
- Mm-hmm.

24:46.931 --> 24:48.064
Okay.

24:49.099 --> 24:50.333
How much?

24:50.367 --> 24:51.901
Five bucks a cup.

24:51.936 --> 24:53.503
Get one for her, please?

25:04.548 --> 25:05.748
What's wrong?

25:05.783 --> 25:06.816
My wallet. It's...

25:12.323 --> 25:13.623
Hey, blonde girl!

25:15.392 --> 25:16.492
Wha...

26:23.398 --> 26:24.432
What did you do to me?

26:24.466 --> 26:26.067
What did I do? What was that?

26:26.101 --> 26:27.390
How should I know?

26:27.415 --> 26:30.250
Because your hands are doing
the exact same thing, but...

26:38.500 --> 26:39.801
Wait, are you that kid?

26:44.239 --> 26:45.339
From the beach?

26:47.209 --> 26:48.309
The beach?

26:59.154 --> 27:00.488
After the storm?

27:08.363 --> 27:10.765
- I gotta go.
- No, stop running.

27:12.367 --> 27:13.601
Who are you?

27:26.448 --> 27:27.548
Hello?

27:32.054 --> 27:33.287
Uh...

27:34.590 --> 27:36.124
Crazy white girl?

28:39.588 --> 28:40.621
Do you believe in God?

28:40.656 --> 28:43.658
I just said his name a few times.

28:43.692 --> 28:45.193
Liam, I'm serious.

28:46.261 --> 28:47.895
God...

28:47.930 --> 28:49.764
Heaven and angels.

28:52.568 --> 28:53.701
Miracles.

28:54.970 --> 28:56.571
I don't think so.

28:59.708 --> 29:01.642
Did I ever tell you about that night?

29:03.371 --> 29:04.671
Car crash?

29:04.705 --> 29:05.906
No, not really.

29:05.940 --> 29:08.475
- I mean, I know your dad...
- Died.

29:12.246 --> 29:13.980
I really think I did, too.

29:16.984 --> 29:19.186
Or, at least, I...

29:19.220 --> 29:20.554
I should have, but...

29:22.924 --> 29:24.825
There was this...

29:27.495 --> 29:29.129
This what?

29:31.766 --> 29:33.366
This hand.

29:38.306 --> 29:39.940
It reached out, and...

29:43.878 --> 29:45.045
Forget it.

29:46.781 --> 29:49.021
You know, you do that a lot.

29:49.091 --> 29:50.128
Do what?

29:50.185 --> 29:53.353
You stop talking right when
you're about to say something.

31:05.594 --> 31:06.894
We take any allegations

31:06.928 --> 31:09.375
of police misconduct quite seriously.

31:09.414 --> 31:11.188
Where's my other son?

31:11.736 --> 31:14.227
Coast Guard found his
body washed up last night.

31:14.267 --> 31:15.226
What?

31:15.251 --> 31:17.845
Tissue test revealed
drugs in his system.

31:17.900 --> 31:20.301
That's not true.

31:22.871 --> 31:24.439
I want to see him.

31:24.473 --> 31:26.074
- Yes, ma'am.
- Mom, Dad.

31:26.108 --> 31:27.275
He's lying!

31:27.309 --> 31:28.543
You're lying and you know it.

31:28.577 --> 31:30.611
One of them shot Billy. I saw it.

31:30.646 --> 31:32.213
We've got no evidence of that.

31:32.247 --> 31:35.116
His body was in no state
to look for bullet holes,

31:35.150 --> 31:37.318
but no officer fired
a weapon that night.

31:38.921 --> 31:41.756
Our search for video surveillance
also turned up this.

31:49.932 --> 31:51.165
Tyrone?

31:52.534 --> 31:54.735
What... what's... what is this?

31:54.770 --> 31:57.305
Billy didn't do anything wrong.

31:57.339 --> 31:58.439
He was just trying to help me.

31:59.808 --> 32:01.976
And this cop...

32:02.010 --> 32:03.311
just killed him.

32:05.080 --> 32:06.214
Red-headed?

32:06.248 --> 32:07.548
Scar on the left side of his face,

32:07.583 --> 32:08.850
that's what you said, right?

32:08.884 --> 32:10.151
That's what he looks like.

32:11.520 --> 32:12.753
Son...

32:14.056 --> 32:15.823
I've worked here for over 20 years.

32:15.858 --> 32:17.458
I know everybody.

32:17.493 --> 32:20.461
This cop you described,
he doesn't exist.

32:41.116 --> 32:42.917
Yeah, I'm on my way now.

32:42.951 --> 32:45.720
No, they all seem receptive
to the proposal.

32:45.754 --> 32:47.054
It's a hell of a deal.

32:48.147 --> 32:49.714
I got the real stuff with me.

32:49.781 --> 32:51.105
I'll meet up with him later tonight.

32:52.722 --> 32:54.228
All right. All right, bye.

33:06.308 --> 33:08.009
Vice. Connors.

33:10.579 --> 33:11.579
Yeah.

33:13.982 --> 33:15.983
Okay. Yeah. Bye.

33:31.166 --> 33:32.800
Hello?

33:34.269 --> 33:35.636
Tandy, is that you?

33:35.671 --> 33:37.838
Uh, yeah. Yep!

33:42.044 --> 33:43.277
Son of a...

33:56.625 --> 33:57.725
Hey, Mom.

33:57.759 --> 34:01.262
Hi. What are you doing here?

34:01.296 --> 34:04.065
It's been what? Two, three weeks?

34:04.099 --> 34:06.534
Oh, the pipes broke
over at Liam's, so...

34:09.271 --> 34:10.705
Finish your shift already?

34:11.940 --> 34:13.541
I finished my last shift.

34:13.574 --> 34:15.509
That manager is an asshole.

34:16.511 --> 34:17.777
Seems like all your managers are.

34:17.813 --> 34:18.846
Right?

34:19.848 --> 34:22.083
But we don't need any of 'em.

34:22.117 --> 34:23.583
This guy that I'm seeing? He's a lawyer.

34:23.619 --> 34:25.052
Is this one married?

34:26.688 --> 34:28.755
He's noble, and he's smart,

34:28.790 --> 34:31.058
and he is gonna get us
back into court again.

34:31.092 --> 34:33.094
Mom, you know court
has never been kind to us.

34:33.128 --> 34:34.829
We're gonna buy that whole damn diner.

34:34.862 --> 34:36.297
How's that sound to you?

34:36.331 --> 34:37.398
Yeah.

34:38.467 --> 34:40.333
Yeah, sounds like a plan.

34:40.369 --> 34:42.203
- Of sorts.
- Sweetheart, what happened to your hand?

34:42.237 --> 34:43.271
- You're bleeding.
- I'm fine.

34:44.429 --> 34:45.797
- Let me look at it.
- Mom, I'm okay.

34:45.822 --> 34:46.871
All right, girls.

34:46.911 --> 34:47.975
To the barre.

34:55.150 --> 34:59.253
Oh, why don't you let
Mommy try and help you?

35:00.389 --> 35:02.089
Around the front

35:02.124 --> 35:03.557
we tie it.

35:03.592 --> 35:05.359
- And what do we do?
- Bunny ears!

35:05.394 --> 35:06.661
A bunny ear.

35:06.695 --> 35:08.296
And then another bunny ear.

35:09.331 --> 35:11.065
Look at this little one.

35:12.434 --> 35:14.468
She used to love dancing so much.

35:15.637 --> 35:17.171
And we used to love watching her.

35:20.676 --> 35:23.010
Everything was so perfect.

35:23.045 --> 35:25.413
I loved you so much,

35:25.447 --> 35:27.081
and you loved me back.

35:27.115 --> 35:28.316
Unconditionally.

35:30.185 --> 35:32.019
And this one.

35:32.054 --> 35:33.254
Oh, Nathan.

35:34.456 --> 35:36.457
She used to be so full of hope.

35:45.267 --> 35:46.467
What just happened?

35:49.504 --> 35:50.838
I don't know. What do you mean?

35:53.375 --> 35:55.309
What do you mean, what do I mean?
Did you not see that?

35:56.378 --> 35:57.478
No. See what?

35:57.512 --> 35:58.579
Wha...

35:58.613 --> 36:00.314
Well, we werback
at the ballet, and Dad...

36:02.818 --> 36:04.452
Did you really not see any of that?

36:04.486 --> 36:05.753
Tandy, are you okay?

36:11.059 --> 36:12.193
Yeah, I'm fine.

36:15.197 --> 36:16.364
I'm good.

36:17.966 --> 36:19.166
Yo! Yo!

36:22.504 --> 36:23.671
Yo, thank you for stopping.

36:23.705 --> 36:25.139
You got money in there?

36:25.173 --> 36:26.607
Uh, no, no,

36:26.641 --> 36:29.443
but listen, I can pay you
back when... when...

36:31.847 --> 36:33.781
When I go on and get my dignity back.

37:00.942 --> 37:01.976
Hey.

37:04.713 --> 37:06.981
- What you been up to?
- English.

37:07.015 --> 37:08.849
I'm reading <i>The Outsiders.</i>

37:08.884 --> 37:10.785
How was school today?

37:12.120 --> 37:14.588
- Same as always, I guess.
- Well, I hope not.

37:14.623 --> 37:16.457
I got a call from them.
They say you didn't show.

37:17.692 --> 37:19.994
- It's okay.
- It most definitely is not okay.

37:20.028 --> 37:22.096
I know it seems bad, but it
was just one day of school.

37:22.130 --> 37:23.998
It's not just one day of school.

37:25.634 --> 37:27.134
I don't know what's
going on with you lately.

37:27.169 --> 37:28.936
That fight.

37:28.970 --> 37:31.404
- You stumbling up the stairs last night.
- I wasn't stumbling.

37:31.428 --> 37:32.896
And don't think
I didn't smell your jacket.

37:32.941 --> 37:34.141
It reeked of alcohol.

37:34.176 --> 37:36.710
I was at a party with
some kids from school, Mom.

37:36.745 --> 37:38.245
- What kids?
- Enough already, Ma.

37:39.881 --> 37:41.148
Enough of what?

37:41.183 --> 37:42.650
The smothering. I get it!

37:42.684 --> 37:44.118
I miss him, too.

37:44.152 --> 37:46.921
I'd do anything to get him back, but...

37:46.955 --> 37:49.123
what I feel is already enough weight.

37:49.157 --> 37:51.625
Ma, I don't need yours, too.

37:51.660 --> 37:52.960
Weight? I...

37:54.930 --> 37:57.998
- Is that what I'm putting on you?
- Yes! You and Dad!

37:58.033 --> 37:59.400
It's... it's like you're afraid if...

37:59.434 --> 38:01.402
if I don't do everything just right,

38:01.436 --> 38:02.937
perfectly, you're gonna lose me.

38:05.440 --> 38:07.141
Oh, baby, I wish it were that easy.

38:09.044 --> 38:11.846
I'm afraid that even if you
do everything perfectly,

38:11.880 --> 38:12.913
I'm gonna lose you.

38:15.517 --> 38:16.584
Mom.

38:18.620 --> 38:20.221
You hear me on that?

38:22.591 --> 38:24.258
- You feel me?
- Yeah.

38:25.460 --> 38:26.527
Yeah, I do.

38:29.130 --> 38:30.723
I, um...

38:30.777 --> 38:33.133
- I'm sorry about school.
- Don't let it happen again, okay?

38:33.168 --> 38:34.301
No, ma'am.

39:04.191 --> 39:05.524
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

39:05.583 --> 39:06.750
You're welcome.

40:49.779 --> 40:51.146
Excuse me, miss?

40:51.211 --> 40:52.511
I think you dropped something.

40:58.847 --> 41:00.180
Hello, again.

41:55.655 --> 41:57.656
Told you she'd use the tickets.

41:57.690 --> 41:59.157
You know how I knew?

41:59.191 --> 42:01.393
Because this little townie bitch
thinks we're idiots.

42:01.427 --> 42:03.561
Dude, look, I'm sorry
I jacked your stuff.

42:03.596 --> 42:05.830
Oh, yeah? How sorry?

42:10.069 --> 42:12.170
Oh, that's how it's gonna be, huh?

42:15.508 --> 42:16.841
Now, I'll see you guys at home.

42:16.876 --> 42:18.643
- Rick.
- Good night.

42:18.678 --> 42:20.011
Don't cry.

42:20.046 --> 42:22.080
Come on, it's not like
we haven't kissed before, right?

42:22.114 --> 42:23.715
It was a pretty good kiss.

42:23.749 --> 42:25.016
You owe me one.

42:46.472 --> 42:48.440
If we're gonna do this, now's the time.

42:48.474 --> 42:51.810
It's set to move from the evidence
locker to the oven tomorrow.

42:51.844 --> 42:55.113
They're gonna burn
20 keys of baby powder.

42:55.147 --> 42:57.515
How do I know it's any good?

42:57.550 --> 43:00.318
I got the NOPD forensic test
for the whole batch.

43:00.353 --> 43:03.755
Legit evidence said it's 96% pure.

43:19.271 --> 43:21.606
Go on, stop fighting.

43:21.640 --> 43:23.174
Come on.

43:29.048 --> 43:30.815
Just give up.

43:31.951 --> 43:33.551
No!

44:34.380 --> 44:35.613
Who the hell are you?

44:41.587 --> 44:42.954
<i>Billy!</i>

44:44.890 --> 44:46.858
- What the hell did you do?
- I don't know!

44:46.892 --> 44:48.259
You shot a kid!

44:49.762 --> 44:50.795
Jesus.

44:52.231 --> 44:54.566
- I need to call my uncle.
- What's he gonna do?

44:56.068 --> 44:57.435
He's gonna fix it.

45:27.433 --> 45:28.500
Please. Don't shoot!
