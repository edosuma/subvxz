00:15.333 --> 00:17.834
( cameras click )

00:24.291 --> 00:26.208
I don't see

00:24.291 --> 00:26.208
any trouble spots.

00:26.250 --> 00:28.792
Everyone is just...looking.

00:28.834 --> 00:31.041
Not much need

00:28.834 --> 00:31.041
for crowd control then.

00:31.083 --> 00:33.542
Let's head home, everyone.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.917
Is Dani here, yet? She's

00:41.375 --> 00:43.917
taking me back out with her.

00:43.959 --> 00:47.500
On her way.

00:47.542 --> 00:50.917
Someone wanna tell me why

00:47.542 --> 00:50.917
looking for a ship off our coast

00:50.959 --> 00:53.083
has this whole town mesmerized?

00:53.125 --> 00:54.834
Nobody's told you

00:53.125 --> 00:54.834
the legend yet?

00:54.875 --> 00:57.667
Oh, we figured Dani was

00:54.875 --> 00:57.667
the best one to fill them in.

00:57.709 --> 00:59.250
Right, boys?

00:59.291 --> 01:02.750
Oh, yeah. She's the "Shipper"

00:59.291 --> 01:02.750
in the family.

01:02.792 --> 01:04.208
Shipper?

01:04.250 --> 01:06.875
Someone who gets

01:04.250 --> 01:06.875
all "Eee!"

01:06.917 --> 01:11.000
about seeing a ship

01:06.917 --> 01:11.000
that's probably not even real.

01:11.041 --> 01:13.250
I think he means "romantic."

01:13.291 --> 01:15.291
You know, mushy stuff.

01:15.333 --> 01:17.750
Are we talking about the same

01:15.333 --> 01:17.750
Dani who took first place

01:17.792 --> 01:19.375
in the recent

01:17.792 --> 01:19.375
Burping Tournament?

01:19.417 --> 01:20.792
Girl didn't even

01:19.417 --> 01:20.792
train for it.

01:20.834 --> 01:22.333
DANI:

01:20.834 --> 01:22.333
Hold the elevator!

01:22.375 --> 01:24.250
Forgot my camera.

01:24.291 --> 01:25.709
Coming, Cody?

01:25.750 --> 01:28.417
Yeah, but the Bots

01:25.750 --> 01:28.417
want to ask you about--

01:28.458 --> 01:30.250
Later. Up, up, up!

01:30.291 --> 01:33.625
Someone please talk sense

01:30.291 --> 01:33.625
into Dani.

01:33.667 --> 01:37.375
She's acting very-- very...

01:33.667 --> 01:37.375
Eee?

01:37.417 --> 01:40.500
Yes! She wants to hover

01:37.417 --> 01:40.500
over the ocean for hours

01:40.542 --> 01:43.625
hoping to spot the ship

01:40.542 --> 01:43.625
everyone's looking for.

01:43.667 --> 01:46.458
It'll be fun, Blades. And we can

01:43.667 --> 01:46.458
meet up with Doc and Frankie.

01:46.500 --> 01:47.750
They're out there too.

01:47.792 --> 01:49.792
(  dramatic theme playing  )

01:52.000 --> 01:53.625
See anything, Frankie?

01:53.667 --> 01:55.709
It's getting

01:53.667 --> 01:55.709
too foggy, Dad.

01:55.750 --> 01:58.667
The ship's appearance has never

01:55.750 --> 01:58.667
been proven scientifically,

01:58.709 --> 02:01.166
but this year I'm prepared.

02:01.208 --> 02:03.625
Hmm. So far

02:01.208 --> 02:03.625
nothing on Radar,

02:03.667 --> 02:07.083
Thermal Scanners,

02:03.667 --> 02:07.083
or the EMF Meter.

02:07.125 --> 02:10.250
Wait. I'm picking up

02:07.125 --> 02:10.250
some kind of energy fluctuation.

02:10.291 --> 02:12.125
( beeping )

02:12.166 --> 02:16.542
Frankie, something very large

02:12.166 --> 02:16.542
has suddenly appeared out there.

02:16.583 --> 02:18.375
( beeping faster )

02:18.417 --> 02:20.709
And it's sending

02:18.417 --> 02:20.709
a distress signal!

02:20.750 --> 02:22.208
Do you have a visual?

02:22.250 --> 02:24.208
Oh! Daddy...

02:24.250 --> 02:27.583
it's the  Phantom Voyager.

03:19.542 --> 03:22.875
Um, afraid Blades

03:19.542 --> 03:22.875
is on strike.

03:22.917 --> 03:26.375
At least until someone explains

03:22.917 --> 03:26.375
why seeing this ship

03:26.417 --> 03:28.166
is worth frosting up my windows.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.917
Everybody seems to know but us.

03:29.959 --> 03:32.375
We're told you are the authority

03:29.959 --> 03:32.375
on the matter.

03:32.417 --> 03:34.709
No ship

03:32.417 --> 03:34.709
is worth all this fuss.

03:34.750 --> 03:38.834
It's only the most tragically

03:34.750 --> 03:38.834
romantic story of the century.

03:38.875 --> 03:41.166
Okay, real quick.

03:41.208 --> 03:43.917
It's the  S.S. Phantom Voyager.

03:43.959 --> 03:46.542
An ocean liner that was

03:43.959 --> 03:46.542
left adrift in 1915

03:46.583 --> 03:48.709
after a lightning strike

03:46.583 --> 03:48.709
disabled the engines.

03:48.750 --> 03:54.125
Everyone got off except

03:48.750 --> 03:54.125
the captain, Ansel Ambrose.

03:54.166 --> 03:56.208
He remained on board

03:54.166 --> 03:56.208
until help could arrive,

03:56.250 --> 03:58.166
but then without warning,

03:58.208 --> 04:00.250
the ship mysteriously vanished.

04:00.291 --> 04:02.500
And on this night

04:00.291 --> 04:02.500
every 10 years,

04:02.542 --> 04:04.000
the  Phantom  reappears

04:04.041 --> 04:06.917
somewhere off the west side

04:04.041 --> 04:06.917
of the island.

04:06.959 --> 04:08.792
The only thing worse

04:06.959 --> 04:08.792
than waiting in the cold

04:08.834 --> 04:12.083
to see that ship

04:08.834 --> 04:12.083
would be seeing that ship.

04:12.125 --> 04:14.208
Tell them the Griffin Rock

connection.

Doc and Frankie think

04:30.041 --> 04:32.291
they've spotted the  Phantom.

04:32.333 --> 04:35.041
And they've received an SOS.

( squeals )

04:39.125 --> 04:41.625

04:45.000 --> 04:46.875
The energy it's releasing...

04:46.917 --> 04:50.000
It seems vaguely familiar.

04:54.333 --> 04:56.542
Ah!

04:54.333 --> 04:56.542
Cody, somebody is on board.

04:56.583 --> 04:57.792
Where are you guys?

04:57.834 --> 04:59.291
Almost there, Frankie.

04:59.333 --> 05:01.250
I still don't see it.

05:01.291 --> 05:03.834
Relax, Dani. It's probably

05:01.291 --> 05:03.834
just some freighter.

05:03.875 --> 05:06.750
It's probably always

05:03.875 --> 05:06.750
just some freighter.

05:06.792 --> 05:09.083
One can only hope.

05:06.792 --> 05:09.083
Who knows?

05:09.125 --> 05:11.125
Plenty of witnesses claim

05:09.125 --> 05:11.125
they've seen the  Phantom,

05:11.166 --> 05:14.166
but sometimes people only see

05:11.166 --> 05:14.166
what they want to see.

05:14.208 --> 05:17.208
So what's this connection to our

05:14.208 --> 05:17.208
island you were talking about?

05:17.250 --> 05:19.375
Captain Ambrose was

05:17.250 --> 05:19.375
supposed to get married

05:19.417 --> 05:20.834
to a girl from Griffin Rock.

05:20.875 --> 05:22.083
( Dani sighs )

05:22.125 --> 05:23.917
Lillian waited for him.

05:23.959 --> 05:27.417
Every 10 years,

05:23.959 --> 05:27.417
she would see the ship appear.

05:27.458 --> 05:29.500
Just for a few moments.

05:29.542 --> 05:31.250
What a horrible story.

05:31.291 --> 05:34.709
Yet tragically romantic.

05:36.542 --> 05:39.667
Hurry, it could disappear

05:36.542 --> 05:39.667
any minute.

05:39.709 --> 05:42.500
That's no freighter.

05:39.709 --> 05:42.500
Nope.

05:42.542 --> 05:43.750
I knew it.

05:43.792 --> 05:47.166
Noble.

05:43.792 --> 05:47.166
Nice job, Frankie!

05:47.208 --> 05:50.792
I know, right? I've waited

05:47.208 --> 05:50.792
my whole life to see this.

05:50.834 --> 05:53.125
And you've never

05:50.834 --> 05:53.125
been good at waiting.

05:53.166 --> 05:56.583
Chief,

05:53.166 --> 05:56.583
there's still an SOS.

05:56.625 --> 05:59.208
Blades, Dani,

05:56.625 --> 05:59.208
do a fly-over.

05:59.250 --> 06:03.166
Okay, seriously. Can we please

05:59.250 --> 06:03.166
get another flying Rescue Bot?

06:03.208 --> 06:06.125
Let me in, Blades, or I'll

06:03.208 --> 06:06.125
dismantle you here and now.

06:06.166 --> 06:08.875

I can be another set of eyes.

06:08.917 --> 06:10.250
Well, all right.

06:10.291 --> 06:12.417
But stay in the air, Dani.

is about to vanish!

07:12.166 --> 07:13.959
Get off the ship, now!

07:14.000 --> 07:15.625
We have to get out of here.

07:15.667 --> 07:18.333
Almost done.

Where's your attacker?

07:21.458 --> 07:23.250
I don't know.

07:21.458 --> 07:23.250
I couldn't really see.

07:23.291 --> 07:26.625
It has to be Captain Ambrose.

07:23.291 --> 07:26.625
Except that would be impossible.

So is standing on the  Phantom,

Oh, how I wish we weren't.

Oh, no.

Oh, no!

Where'd everyone go?

08:04.417 --> 08:05.625
Where'd we go?

Should I try

To where, Blades?

08:07.333 --> 08:10.166
Who knows where we are.

08:10.208 --> 08:13.500
However, if the pattern

remains unchanged,

I believe I know

08:13.542 --> 08:16.000
when we will return.

You mean...

08:16.041 --> 08:19.458

We can fix this, right?

this ship keeps

08:23.792 --> 08:25.333
coming and going.

08:25.375 --> 08:28.166
Maybe whoever tried to snag us

08:25.375 --> 08:28.166
knows the answer.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.458
Then we search this tub

08:28.208 --> 08:30.458
top to bottom.

08:30.500 --> 08:31.917
Then we'll take the top.

08:31.959 --> 08:34.000
You guys will only fit

08:31.959 --> 08:34.000
in the service floors below.

08:34.041 --> 08:37.709
Take the freight elevator,

08:34.041 --> 08:37.709
it's portside.

08:37.750 --> 08:40.000
Who knows

08:37.750 --> 08:40.000
their  Phantom  trivia?

08:40.041 --> 08:42.458
( squeals )

08:42.500 --> 08:44.917
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

08:44.959 --> 08:47.208
You guys see that?

08:48.709 --> 08:50.917
Neither did I.

08:57.250 --> 08:58.583
Blades?

08:58.625 --> 09:00.375
When you three are running

08:58.625 --> 09:00.375
for your lives,

09:00.417 --> 09:02.625
you'll need someone

09:00.417 --> 09:02.625
holding the elevator.

09:02.667 --> 09:06.625
And if we happen to be chasing

09:02.667 --> 09:06.625
the ghost of Captain Ambrose?

09:06.667 --> 09:09.333
Right. Safety in numbers.

09:12.125 --> 09:14.125
( electricity crackles )

09:16.083 --> 09:19.750
The dining hall

09:16.083 --> 09:19.750
should be right...

09:21.625 --> 09:23.792
Here. Oh, amazing.

09:23.834 --> 09:26.917
Just like the old pictures.

09:28.125 --> 09:30.291
There's still food

09:28.125 --> 09:30.291
in here.

09:30.333 --> 09:31.959
Captain Ambrose

09:30.333 --> 09:31.959
and the passengers

09:32.000 --> 09:34.542
were preparing for dinner

09:32.000 --> 09:34.542
when the lightning struck.

09:34.583 --> 09:35.792
( both sniffing )

09:35.834 --> 09:37.500
Oh, it smells good.

09:37.542 --> 09:39.750
Oh-ho-ho, it sure does.

09:39.792 --> 09:41.417
( moaning )

09:41.458 --> 09:42.709
Mmm!

09:44.917 --> 09:48.000
What?

09:44.917 --> 09:48.000
That's a hundred years old.

09:48.041 --> 09:49.625
Still tastes better

09:48.041 --> 09:49.625
than Dani's cooking.

09:49.667 --> 09:51.583
( distant thud )

09:52.792 --> 09:54.750
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

09:56.500 --> 10:00.542
Captain Ambrose? Is that you?

10:03.000 --> 10:04.875
Let me guess,

10:03.000 --> 10:04.875
protecting the rear?

10:04.917 --> 10:07.125
Yes.

10:04.917 --> 10:07.125
It's the least we could do.

10:07.166 --> 10:08.917
We're here for you,

10:07.166 --> 10:08.917
Dani.

10:08.959 --> 10:13.750
This way,

10:08.959 --> 10:13.750
my brave bodyguards.

10:18.959 --> 10:22.375
CHASE:

10:18.959 --> 10:22.375
This search may take a while.

10:22.417 --> 10:25.041
Split up.

10:22.417 --> 10:25.041
We hit every aisle.

10:25.083 --> 10:30.041
Split up? Have you learned

10:25.083 --> 10:30.041
nothing from scary movies?

10:30.083 --> 10:32.709
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

10:41.250 --> 10:43.875
Nothing here.

10:41.250 --> 10:43.875
Can't see anything.

10:47.125 --> 10:49.625
Fascinating.

10:49.667 --> 10:53.041
Done!

10:49.667 --> 10:53.041
What's taking you guys so--

10:53.083 --> 10:54.625
( screams )

10:54.667 --> 10:56.417
G-G-Ghost!

10:54.667 --> 10:56.417
Was it Ambrose?

10:56.458 --> 10:57.834
Please provide

10:56.458 --> 10:57.834
a full description.

10:57.875 --> 10:59.083
I don't see anything.

10:59.125 --> 11:03.166
It-- I-- There-- Not. Aah!

11:03.208 --> 11:05.709
This way!

11:09.500 --> 11:10.750
Dead end!

11:13.166 --> 11:15.917
Apparently

11:13.166 --> 11:15.917
because it is a trap.

11:15.959 --> 11:18.041
( rumbling )

11:18.083 --> 11:20.208
( waltz music playing )

11:20.250 --> 11:22.750
Is that music

11:20.250 --> 11:22.750
from beyond?

11:22.792 --> 11:26.458
If we find ghosts waltzing,

11:22.792 --> 11:26.458
I'm jumping overboard.

11:36.625 --> 11:37.875
( gasps )

11:36.625 --> 11:37.875
Whoa.

11:38.875 --> 11:40.333
KADE:

11:38.875 --> 11:40.333
It's him.

11:40.375 --> 11:41.875
( both gasp )

11:43.709 --> 11:46.875
I've waylaid your giant

11:43.709 --> 11:46.875
iron men in the hold.

11:46.917 --> 11:49.542
Therefore your attempt

11:46.917 --> 11:49.542
to take over my ship has failed.

11:49.583 --> 11:51.083
What?

11:49.583 --> 11:51.083
We don't want

11:51.125 --> 11:53.834
your stinkin' ghost ship.

11:51.125 --> 11:53.834
Captain Ambrose,

11:53.875 --> 11:55.709
we're rescuers.

11:55.750 --> 11:57.542
W-we heard

11:55.750 --> 11:57.542
a distress call, and--

11:57.583 --> 11:59.041
What country sent you?

11:59.083 --> 12:01.250
Who builds machines

11:59.083 --> 12:01.250
that talk like people

12:01.291 --> 12:03.542
and aircraft

12:01.291 --> 12:03.542
that fly without wings?

12:03.583 --> 12:05.250
We're from Griffin Rock.

12:05.291 --> 12:08.625
Impossible.

12:05.291 --> 12:08.625
My beloved lives there.

12:08.667 --> 12:10.834
Nothing like this

12:08.667 --> 12:10.834
exists on that island.

12:10.875 --> 12:12.917
DANI:

12:10.875 --> 12:12.917
A lot has changed.

12:12.959 --> 12:14.834
You and this ship

12:14.875 --> 12:17.375
have been lost at sea

12:14.875 --> 12:17.375
for a century.

12:17.417 --> 12:21.709
Evacuations were completed a day

12:17.417 --> 12:21.709
ago. I await the towing barges.

12:21.750 --> 12:23.625
CODY:

12:21.750 --> 12:23.625
The barges came.

12:23.667 --> 12:26.166
The  S.S. Phantom

12:23.667 --> 12:26.166
was nowhere to be found.

12:26.208 --> 12:29.625
No. No, I've seen Griffin Rock

12:26.208 --> 12:29.625
in the distance yonder.

12:29.667 --> 12:32.041
It appears through the fog,

12:29.667 --> 12:32.041
every hour.

12:32.083 --> 12:36.041
But each time we see

12:32.083 --> 12:36.041
the  Phantom  from the island,

12:36.083 --> 12:39.417
ten whole years have gone by.

12:42.083 --> 12:45.333
I hear the ocean.

12:42.083 --> 12:45.333
We're back!

12:45.375 --> 12:47.834
( all grunting )

12:52.417 --> 12:54.625
(  dramatic theme playing  )

12:57.542 --> 12:58.792
There.

12:58.834 --> 13:00.667
Griffin Rock.

13:02.959 --> 13:04.417
No, wait!

13:04.458 --> 13:06.959
This guy locked us up

13:04.458 --> 13:06.959
in the cargo hold.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.041
It's Captain Ambrose.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.041
He's just confused.

13:10.083 --> 13:11.542
Ambrose?

13:11.583 --> 13:13.667
He doesn't look like a ghost.

13:11.583 --> 13:13.667
He isn't.

13:13.709 --> 13:17.125
Then shouldn't he be, like,

13:13.709 --> 13:17.125
really old?

13:17.166 --> 13:21.750
Somehow ten years out there

13:17.166 --> 13:21.750
is only an hour on this ship.

13:21.792 --> 13:23.625
But we have been here

13:21.792 --> 13:23.625
an hour.

13:23.667 --> 13:24.917
Then that would mean...

13:24.959 --> 13:27.542
No way. It can't be.

13:27.583 --> 13:29.041
( crashing )

13:29.083 --> 13:32.542
( alarm blaring )

13:32.583 --> 13:34.083
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

13:34.125 --> 13:36.250
MAN:

13:34.125 --> 13:36.250
Help! Help us!

13:36.291 --> 13:38.458
Please!

13:36.291 --> 13:38.458
WOMAN: Help me!

13:38.500 --> 13:40.417
MAN:

13:38.500 --> 13:40.417
Please! Throw me a line!

13:46.208 --> 13:49.500
Oh, my...

13:46.208 --> 13:49.500
I don't believe it.

13:50.667 --> 13:52.458
(  dramatic theme playing  )

13:52.500 --> 13:54.375
Dad?

13:54.417 --> 13:57.834
Kids, it's really you.

13:57.875 --> 13:59.250
Astonishing.

13:59.291 --> 14:01.083
They haven't aged a day.

14:01.125 --> 14:03.208
We have to save

14:01.125 --> 14:03.208
the reunion for later.

14:03.250 --> 14:04.875
That ferry's going down.

14:04.917 --> 14:08.458
You heard the Chief.

14:04.917 --> 14:08.458
Rescue Bots, Roll to the Rescue!

14:17.500 --> 14:19.917
This really is the future?

14:19.959 --> 14:22.125
Yes. And this is what we do.

14:22.166 --> 14:23.792
Hop in.

14:26.583 --> 14:29.333
( grunts )

14:29.375 --> 14:31.458
(  dramatic theme playing  )

14:54.250 --> 14:57.333
( beeping )

15:15.542 --> 15:18.458
(  soft dramatic theme playing  )

15:24.792 --> 15:26.750
If it helps at all,

15:26.792 --> 15:30.083
Lillian never forgot you.

15:38.875 --> 15:43.166
It's been a long ten years.

15:46.083 --> 15:48.959
Oh, Dad.

15:50.583 --> 15:54.875
Five more minutes before

15:50.583 --> 15:54.875
the ship disappears again.

16:00.667 --> 16:04.542
Frankie. You got...big.

16:04.583 --> 16:07.542
It just...happened.

16:07.583 --> 16:11.458
You were right, Cody.

16:07.583 --> 16:11.458
I've never been good at waiting.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.667
I missed you.

16:13.709 --> 16:17.417
I had to grow up

16:13.709 --> 16:17.417
without my best friend.

16:17.458 --> 16:20.750
Sorry we weren't there

16:17.458 --> 16:20.750
for you, Chief.

16:20.792 --> 16:22.917
Feels like we abandoned

16:20.792 --> 16:22.917
our post.

16:22.959 --> 16:25.208
I trust you found...

16:25.250 --> 16:28.166
suitable replacement vehicles.

16:28.208 --> 16:30.041
There's no replacing

16:28.208 --> 16:30.041
you guys.

16:30.083 --> 16:31.625
Dad?

16:31.667 --> 16:34.458
This is Captain Ambrose.

16:34.500 --> 16:37.709
And good news,

16:34.500 --> 16:37.709
he's not a ghost.

16:37.750 --> 16:41.542
Mr. Burns.

16:37.750 --> 16:41.542
I wish I had some answers.

16:41.583 --> 16:43.333
Fortunately, we do,

16:43.375 --> 16:45.917
from the data Doc

16:43.375 --> 16:45.917
collected 10 years ago.

16:45.959 --> 16:49.166
The energy pattern

16:45.959 --> 16:49.166
emitted by this ship

16:49.208 --> 16:51.875
is the same found

16:49.208 --> 16:51.875
in the old time machine

16:51.917 --> 16:54.208
that used to be under my lab.

16:54.250 --> 16:55.583
Time machine.

16:55.625 --> 16:57.667
That could be what I saw

16:55.625 --> 16:57.667
down in the hold.

16:57.709 --> 16:59.500
Somebody must've been

16:57.709 --> 16:59.500
transporting one

16:59.542 --> 17:01.875
on the  Phantom.

16:59.542 --> 17:01.875
( beeping )

17:01.917 --> 17:05.000
One minute left. We need to go.

17:06.500 --> 17:08.875
Come home.

17:06.500 --> 17:08.875
It'll be an adjustment,

17:08.917 --> 17:10.917
but at least

17:08.917 --> 17:10.917
we'll all be together.

17:10.959 --> 17:15.333
Dad, if a time machine did this,

17:10.959 --> 17:15.333
then we can reverse it.

17:15.375 --> 17:18.417
And return to where we started.

17:18.458 --> 17:20.333
Where we all started.

17:20.375 --> 17:22.500
Let us try, Dad. Please?

17:24.667 --> 17:26.792
All right.

17:26.834 --> 17:28.875
I'll be back.

17:28.917 --> 17:31.500
(  soft dramatic theme playing  )

17:52.083 --> 17:54.709
That's a time machine,

17:52.083 --> 17:54.709
all right.

17:54.750 --> 17:58.750
It belonged to a passenger

17:54.750 --> 17:58.750
named Dr. Thaddeus Morocco.

17:58.792 --> 18:00.750
Now this makes sense.

18:00.792 --> 18:02.709
You know of him?

18:00.792 --> 18:02.709
DANI: Too well.

18:02.750 --> 18:04.667
For one, he built the time

18:02.750 --> 18:04.667
machine on Griffin Rock.

18:04.709 --> 18:07.750
Okay, but what made

18:04.709 --> 18:07.750
this one malfunction?

18:07.792 --> 18:10.917
Perhaps it was the lightning

18:07.792 --> 18:10.917
strike that hit the  Phantom?

18:10.959 --> 18:13.333
I think you're right.

18:13.375 --> 18:16.041
And the jolt froze up

18:13.375 --> 18:16.041
the controls too.

18:16.083 --> 18:17.750
So the machine

18:16.083 --> 18:17.750
is stuck on a setting

18:17.792 --> 18:20.250
that makes it skip ahead

18:17.792 --> 18:20.250
10 years at a time.

18:20.291 --> 18:22.709
But why does it feel

18:20.291 --> 18:22.709
like only an hour to us?

18:22.750 --> 18:25.041
Because of the damage

18:22.750 --> 18:25.041
to the machine.

18:25.083 --> 18:26.959
On this ship,

18:25.083 --> 18:26.959
we're zipping through time,

18:27.000 --> 18:28.834
stopping briefly

18:27.000 --> 18:28.834
every 10 years...

18:28.875 --> 18:31.500
But outside,

18:28.875 --> 18:31.500
time is passing normally.

18:31.542 --> 18:34.041
Uh, yeah, has there been

18:31.542 --> 18:34.041
a solution mentioned anywhere?

18:34.083 --> 18:35.500
Or should I go back

18:34.083 --> 18:35.500
to not listening?

18:35.542 --> 18:37.917
A power boost.

18:35.542 --> 18:37.917
That's how we got

18:37.959 --> 18:40.166
the old time machine

18:37.959 --> 18:40.166
in the lab to work.

18:40.208 --> 18:41.458
Using Energon.

18:41.500 --> 18:43.083
Still have

18:41.500 --> 18:43.083
an emergency supply?

18:43.125 --> 18:46.542
Not very much. I knew

18:43.125 --> 18:46.542
I should've restocked.

18:48.792 --> 18:51.291
Let's hope it's enough.

18:53.333 --> 18:56.500
More purple.

18:53.333 --> 18:56.500
That's good, right?

18:56.542 --> 18:58.583
BOULDER:

18:56.542 --> 18:58.583
That means

18:56.542 --> 18:58.583
the power's stabilized.

19:02.208 --> 19:03.917
And the controls are working.

19:03.959 --> 19:07.500
Now we turn the dial back

19:03.959 --> 19:07.500
to the previous 10-year mark.

19:07.542 --> 19:09.458
Ready everyone?

19:14.000 --> 19:16.125
Here we go.

19:16.166 --> 19:18.667
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

19:27.750 --> 19:29.917
The ocean.

19:27.750 --> 19:29.917
We're back!

19:29.959 --> 19:32.750
Yeah, but back when?

19:38.041 --> 19:39.500
Oh! I see it!

19:39.542 --> 19:42.375
Another energy spike.

19:39.542 --> 19:42.375
The ship has returned!

19:42.417 --> 19:43.917
Kids? Are you there?

19:43.959 --> 19:47.208
We made it!

19:47.250 --> 19:50.500
Captain, turn the dial

19:47.250 --> 19:50.500
10 more notches back.

19:50.542 --> 19:54.041
I can't promise anything,

19:50.542 --> 19:54.041
but that should take you home.

19:54.083 --> 19:56.333
My Lillian

19:54.083 --> 19:56.333
is waiting for me.

19:56.375 --> 19:58.250
And that's worth any risk.

19:58.291 --> 20:01.125
Uh, captain?

19:58.291 --> 20:01.125
Might not want to tell anybody

20:01.166 --> 20:02.458
what really happened.

20:02.500 --> 20:04.417
Not sure they'd believe you,

20:02.500 --> 20:04.417
anyway.

20:04.458 --> 20:07.709
Agreed, young man.

20:04.458 --> 20:07.709
But it is nice to know

20:07.750 --> 20:10.709
that the future

20:07.750 --> 20:10.709
is in such good hands.

20:10.750 --> 20:15.083
Now go, and thank you.

20:17.166 --> 20:18.625
Here they come!

20:18.667 --> 20:21.125
(  soft dramatic theme playing  )

20:33.667 --> 20:35.500
Hey, Frankie.

20:35.542 --> 20:38.834
"Hey, Frankie"?

20:35.542 --> 20:38.834
What happened?

20:38.875 --> 20:41.208
Yeah, we lost track of you

20:38.875 --> 20:41.208
for a moment or two.

20:41.250 --> 20:42.542
What did you find?

20:42.583 --> 20:44.417
We found Captain Ambrose.

20:44.458 --> 20:47.417
And hopefully we rescued him.

20:48.500 --> 20:50.083
( alarm blaring )

20:53.000 --> 20:55.250
CAPTAIN: What's the emergency?

20:53.000 --> 20:55.250
KADE: Who rang the alarm?

20:55.291 --> 20:57.166
We're ready!

20:55.291 --> 20:57.166
Where are we going?

20:57.208 --> 20:59.667
Allow me the pleasure

20:57.208 --> 20:59.667
of announcing the wedding

20:59.709 --> 21:04.458
of Ansel and Lillian Ambrose

20:59.709 --> 21:04.458
in 1915.

21:04.500 --> 21:05.792
He made it.

21:05.834 --> 21:07.625
( all cheering )

21:07.667 --> 21:10.041
Eee!

21:10.083 --> 21:11.583
( clears throat )

21:11.625 --> 21:13.792
Oh, I was... you know,

21:13.834 --> 21:16.041
just practicing

21:13.834 --> 21:16.041
for the next Burping Tournament.

21:16.083 --> 21:17.583
Ahem. Eee!

21:17.625 --> 21:18.834
( belches )

21:18.875 --> 21:22.125
Oh, yeah? Bring it on.

21:22.166 --> 21:23.875
( inhales )

21:23.917 --> 21:27.041
( belches loudly )

21:27.083 --> 21:29.625
KADE:

21:27.083 --> 21:29.625
How do you do that?

21:29.667 --> 21:32.792
(  waltz theme playing  )
