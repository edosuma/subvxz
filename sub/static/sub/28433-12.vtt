It's...the North American rights

09:14.688 --> 09:16.056
You should do
a show here.

We don't have
any performers.

09:31.004 --> 09:32.405

we'll do it right.

selling tickets,

09:49.422 --> 09:50.590

What if a waiter
gets murdered,

18:26.806 --> 18:30.210
and we find out that
the murderer who murdered him

18:30.310 --> 18:32.879
isn't who we thought
he was?

18:32.979 --> 18:35.982
We've already done that.

-Yes.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.717
I've been looking everywhere
for you.

19:10.817 --> 19:13.386
I'm Eric Jeremyson III,
president of Broadway.

19:13.486 --> 19:14.754
Hi.

19:14.854 --> 19:16.589
Buying the North American rights
to "Stomp"

19:16.689 --> 19:18.057
was a smart investment.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.092
You must be
a very happy man.

19:20.193 --> 19:21.661
Well,
obviously you are.

19:21.761 --> 19:23.563
You're sitting here alone
on this park bench,

19:23.663 --> 19:25.698
reflecting on your happiness,
no doubt.

19:25.798 --> 19:28.535
-Get to it.
-I'd like to offer you
and your family

19:28.635 --> 19:31.170
a lifetime contract

But I need your answer
tonight.

19:36.209 --> 19:40.046
-Why?
-For drama!

19:44.217 --> 19:45.885
Hey,
where are the brooms?

19:45.985 --> 19:48.621
Huh, are they not where
they always are?

19:48.721 --> 19:50.290
There's just rakes.

19:50.390 --> 19:51.958
No brooms?!

19:52.058 --> 19:54.794
What the hell are we supposed
to do with rakes?!

19:54.894 --> 19:57.764
Calm down. We're the ones
that make the show amazing.

The props don't matter.

I've got to tell you something
before you read it

in The Village Voice
tomorrow.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.443
I switched out
the brooms.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.279
Why would you do
such a thing?

20:12.379 --> 20:13.746
I know
we didn't vote on it,

20:13.846 --> 20:15.548
but our family's happiness
is too important

20:15.648 --> 20:16.916
to leave to democracy.

20:17.016 --> 20:18.285
We're miserable here.

20:18.385 --> 20:20.253
Maybe,
but being miserable

20:20.353 --> 20:21.954
and pretending to love
living here

20:22.054 --> 20:23.923
is just
what New Yorkers do.

That's what I was doing.

Being together with you

this past year,

20:27.394 --> 20:28.661
I've never felt
so alone.

20:28.761 --> 20:30.263
Me, too, babe.

20:30.363 --> 20:32.732
Plus, these buildings
are too tall.

20:32.832 --> 20:35.302
And let's admit it,
Domino's has better pizza.

20:35.402 --> 20:37.003
The last time I was happy

20:37.103 --> 20:40.139
was when we were making memories
together as a family.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.741
I want to go back
to that place.

20:41.841 --> 20:43.643
I want to go home, too,
Dad.
