00:46.745 --> 00:51.481
Come on, time to go.
We haven't got all day.

00:51.483 --> 00:55.519
Get that monkey on the train.

00:55.521 --> 00:59.024
The Medici Brothers' circus
is taking off!

02:58.944 --> 03:00.709
Breathing normal...

03:00.711 --> 03:02.279
heart rate normal.

03:03.447 --> 03:04.682
You're cleared to perform.

03:05.916 --> 03:08.751
Milly!
Another train!

03:15.326 --> 03:17.426
<i>Ninos,</i> wait!
We are coming, too!

03:29.740 --> 03:31.507
Joplin!

03:31.509 --> 03:33.308
Joplin, Missouri!

03:33.310 --> 03:35.479
- Hey, sweetheart!
- Daddy!

04:06.711 --> 04:09.478
Oh, I meant to tell ya.

04:09.480 --> 04:10.848
You know,
in the letter I sent?

04:12.049 --> 04:15.452
I'm so sorry
that I wasn't here.

04:16.553 --> 04:17.822
Well, come here now.

04:18.923 --> 04:20.255
Still me.

04:27.464 --> 04:28.866
And you...

04:30.868 --> 04:32.335
you're just as pretty
as your momma.

04:40.978 --> 04:42.312
We missed you, Dad.

04:43.814 --> 04:45.015
I missed you, too.

04:49.019 --> 04:51.552
Ivan and Catherine,
thank you both...

04:51.554 --> 04:53.321
for looking out for them.

04:53.323 --> 04:54.789
Captain Farrier,
of course.

04:54.791 --> 04:56.591
Oh, it's Holt, come on now.

04:56.593 --> 04:57.926
It's just Holt.

04:57.928 --> 04:59.529
Don't you worry.

05:01.098 --> 05:03.399
Everything's gonna be
just like it was before.

05:07.637 --> 05:08.636
Come on! Come on!

05:08.638 --> 05:10.005
Home sweet home.

05:10.007 --> 05:12.308
- Hey! Holt!
- Hey, Puck.

05:13.510 --> 05:14.642
- Hey, Thomas.
- Milly, come on!

05:14.644 --> 05:15.845
Hi, Holt.

05:16.780 --> 05:19.482
Oh! Hey, Miss Atlantis.

05:20.850 --> 05:22.617
Pramesh!

05:22.619 --> 05:24.352
The very best journey,
dear friend.

05:24.354 --> 05:26.788
The road that leads home.

05:26.790 --> 05:28.656
Welcome home.

05:30.593 --> 05:32.362
No hugs!

05:33.730 --> 05:36.364
Pramesh,
I missed you, too.

05:36.366 --> 05:39.534
What's going on? The camp's
half the size it used to be.

05:39.536 --> 05:42.036
Hard times, my friend.
For everyone.

05:48.578 --> 05:50.812
Attention, everybody!

05:50.814 --> 05:54.749
Why is Rule Number One
called Rule Number One?

05:54.751 --> 05:57.552
Because
"keep the cages locked"

05:57.554 --> 05:59.821
is the most important
rule of all!

05:59.823 --> 06:01.823
When I catch
that fugitive scalawag

06:01.825 --> 06:03.524
who interrupted my dream...

06:03.526 --> 06:04.492
Rongo!

06:04.494 --> 06:05.827
Where is Rongo?

06:07.931 --> 06:09.931
Who's heading
camp management?

06:09.933 --> 06:11.165
I'm the strongman.

06:11.167 --> 06:13.835
Yes, but we're all wearing
multiple hats!

06:13.837 --> 06:17.672
You're in charge of budgets,
and accounting, and inventory.

06:17.674 --> 06:20.174
Which means
animal whereabouts!

06:20.176 --> 06:22.176
Now, go find that monkey!

06:22.178 --> 06:24.080
I'll have a look around.

06:31.054 --> 06:32.655
All right, everybody.
Back to work.

06:36.860 --> 06:37.961
Holt!

06:48.104 --> 06:51.707
This winter, the influenza
hit us like a hurricane.

06:52.507 --> 06:55.176
Natalya, Vincenzo...

06:55.178 --> 06:57.814
the Vanderjees, and then...

06:59.015 --> 07:01.615
your wife.

07:01.617 --> 07:02.919
Poor Annie.

07:05.654 --> 07:07.656
How she fought.

07:10.492 --> 07:11.961
She was the best of us.

07:13.096 --> 07:15.029
I know it.

07:15.031 --> 07:17.764
So, uh, you know, for her,

07:17.766 --> 07:19.035
let's have
our best season yet!

07:20.602 --> 07:21.970
Now where's my horses?

07:22.771 --> 07:24.205
Ah...

07:24.207 --> 07:26.073
Funny story about that.

07:26.075 --> 07:27.607
Funny how?

07:27.609 --> 07:29.676
He sold them.

07:29.678 --> 07:31.478
But our act is the soul
of this show!

07:31.480 --> 07:36.016
And first, we lost you,
and then Annie, to ride 'em!

07:36.018 --> 07:38.485
If only Milly would have
learned the trade.

07:38.487 --> 07:39.920
I don't wanna be a show-off
in your circus.

07:39.922 --> 07:42.055
- "Show-off"?
- You see?

07:42.057 --> 07:44.724
I wanna make
scientific discoveries.

07:44.726 --> 07:46.526
I wanna be noticed
for my mind.

07:46.528 --> 07:47.994
Okay.

07:47.996 --> 07:51.631
Then learn clairvoyance.
Telepathy! Something!

07:51.633 --> 07:54.668
I can do a handstand
for almost ten seconds.

07:54.670 --> 07:57.070
Oh.

07:57.072 --> 08:01.074
"Child does handstand."
We'll be broke by July.

08:01.076 --> 08:03.845
Hang on now. Without horses,
what the hell's my act?

08:04.846 --> 08:07.247
The crowds come to see me!

08:07.249 --> 08:08.249
Max, please.

08:09.785 --> 08:11.653
I need to work.

08:12.988 --> 08:14.721
Good news.

08:14.723 --> 08:16.556
One job, I have.

08:16.558 --> 08:18.591
Okay, then.
Give me a showstopper.

08:18.593 --> 08:20.260
You know that old rascal
Itchy McPhee?

08:20.262 --> 08:21.962
He finally ran off
with the bearded lady.

08:21.964 --> 08:26.066
I've been filling in with
roustabouts ever since.

08:26.068 --> 08:28.201
I need somebody good
to tend the elephants.

08:28.203 --> 08:30.236
No, you're not serious.

08:30.238 --> 08:31.638
I am on occasion.

08:31.640 --> 08:33.173
This is a big job
and you know it.

08:33.174 --> 08:34.808
No, it's a big shovel
for a big pile of...

08:34.809 --> 08:35.809
Dad.

08:38.313 --> 08:41.648
So you sold my horses
and kept your elephants.

08:41.650 --> 08:44.918
Your scrawny, mangy,
cut-rate elephants.

08:44.920 --> 08:47.155
They're important.
Especially this season.

08:47.923 --> 08:49.189
Why's that?

08:49.191 --> 08:51.024
I know it goes
against my nature...

08:51.026 --> 08:54.828
but for once,
I made an investment.

08:56.798 --> 09:00.033
<i>Bellissima!</i>
There she is!

09:00.035 --> 09:02.836
Our brand-new Asian female.

09:02.838 --> 09:05.804
I bought her off
a Brugelbecker in Biloxi.

09:05.806 --> 09:07.806
I had to get him
way down on the price.

09:07.808 --> 09:09.575
But I swear to you, Holt,

09:09.577 --> 09:12.678
I saw something special
in her eyes.

09:12.680 --> 09:16.016
This is your investment?
An old, sick elephant.

09:16.018 --> 09:18.120
Oh, no. She's not sick.

09:19.121 --> 09:20.753
Any day now...

09:20.755 --> 09:23.056
she's having a baby.

09:27.362 --> 09:30.130
Dad, watch! Dad!
I'm getting better!

09:30.132 --> 09:31.832
Hang on now,
this is our tent?

09:33.135 --> 09:34.367
What happened to our things?

09:34.369 --> 09:37.772
We had nice furniture,
we had rooms.

09:38.939 --> 09:41.107
Max, what didn't you sell?

09:41.109 --> 09:43.042
You son of a gun.

09:43.044 --> 09:44.111
Dad, look!

09:44.812 --> 09:46.011
Toys?

09:46.013 --> 09:47.846
They're not toys.

09:47.848 --> 09:49.315
They're for
my science experiments.

09:49.317 --> 09:52.051
Well, we're a circus,
darlin', a circus.

09:52.053 --> 09:54.787
We need to be practical
if we want to survive.

09:54.789 --> 09:57.357
You couldn't
just take up one act?

09:57.359 --> 09:59.792
Tumblin' or tightrope?

09:59.794 --> 10:01.695
Maybe I don't need
the world staring at me.

10:02.997 --> 10:04.730
Maybe I'm just not
you and Mom.

10:04.732 --> 10:06.332
Well, who makes the rules
in this family?

10:06.667 --> 10:07.933
Mom did.

10:07.935 --> 10:09.134
Yeah, well,
I make them now.

10:09.136 --> 10:11.236
So just, uh...
Go to your room!

10:11.238 --> 10:12.673
This is my room.

10:14.008 --> 10:16.208
This is all our rooms.

10:16.210 --> 10:18.310
See this?

10:18.312 --> 10:20.112
You know what this is?

10:20.114 --> 10:21.682
It's your inheritance.

10:23.851 --> 10:25.350
Dad!

10:25.352 --> 10:28.787
Don't worry,
he's not going anywhere.

10:28.789 --> 10:30.656
He's stuck here.

10:30.658 --> 10:32.226
Like you and me.

10:46.006 --> 10:47.675
Come on, come on,
you're missing it!

10:49.910 --> 10:53.145
Look, I can do it!
I'm doing it, Milly!

10:53.147 --> 10:55.013
A new season!

11:08.062 --> 11:10.295
Let me in,
you little hairball!

11:18.072 --> 11:20.205
Hey!

11:20.207 --> 11:23.743
Would somebody please
let me in my own train?

12:06.819 --> 12:08.219
Dad, wake up! Let's go!

12:08.221 --> 12:09.488
The elephants need us!

12:09.490 --> 12:10.955
Good God, son,

12:10.957 --> 12:12.424
you're gonna make me
miss the war.

12:12.426 --> 12:14.759
Gimme that.

12:14.761 --> 12:16.060
Go on, lead the way.

12:16.062 --> 12:17.931
Move it!

12:20.501 --> 12:22.099
Let's skedaddle, Mrs. Jumbo!

12:22.101 --> 12:24.001
Don't make me
have to incentivize.

12:24.003 --> 12:25.083
Get her out of there, boys.

12:27.373 --> 12:28.906
Easy, Rufus.

12:28.908 --> 12:30.475
That's a lady in there.

12:30.477 --> 12:33.110
Well, well, our own Tom Mix
ridin' in to the rescue.

12:33.112 --> 12:35.346
But he just ain't
on the marquee no more.

12:35.348 --> 12:37.081
Time to see
what he's been missing.

12:37.083 --> 12:38.783
Do you ever
get that feeling?

12:38.785 --> 12:40.218
Like there's something
you're missing?

12:40.220 --> 12:42.453
Imagine my surprise,
you didn't enlist.

12:42.455 --> 12:45.122
- Weak ticker. Doc's advice.
- Uh-huh.

12:45.124 --> 12:48.025
Dad? Something's wrong.

12:48.027 --> 12:50.363
She doesn't wanna leave.

12:54.267 --> 12:55.366
Come on!

12:55.368 --> 12:56.936
Let's get her outta there!

12:59.839 --> 13:01.774
- What are you doing?
- Come on!

13:03.009 --> 13:04.475
Leave her alone!

13:04.477 --> 13:06.277
- Stop hurting her, please!
- Leave her alone!

13:18.091 --> 13:19.156
Dad, look.

13:19.158 --> 13:20.460
What now?

13:21.527 --> 13:22.861
Move her!

13:25.598 --> 13:28.898
Whoa, we got
a baby in here.

13:34.607 --> 13:35.606
She had a baby!

13:35.608 --> 13:36.873
- Baby!
- Huh?

13:36.875 --> 13:38.042
Notify the press!

13:38.044 --> 13:39.310
"The Medici Brothers...

13:39.312 --> 13:41.379
"proudly present
America's newest,

13:41.381 --> 13:44.317
"precious bundle of joy!"

13:45.351 --> 13:46.486
Look at that.

13:48.121 --> 13:49.121
It's okay now.

13:50.456 --> 13:52.292
Don't be scared.

13:54.860 --> 13:58.364
Don't be scared now,
your momma's right outside.

14:29.495 --> 14:31.361
Baby! We got a baby!

14:31.363 --> 14:32.964
We got a baby!

14:38.403 --> 14:39.637
What is that?

14:39.639 --> 14:40.939
Baby Jumbo.

14:42.341 --> 14:45.241
I already got fake freaks
in the freak show!

14:45.243 --> 14:47.477
I don't need a real one
in the center ring!

14:47.479 --> 14:50.447
Rongo!
We've been swindled!

14:50.449 --> 14:53.416
Gone and
bought yourself a baby monster.

14:53.418 --> 14:54.453
Think he can hear me?

14:56.221 --> 14:57.487
Boo!

15:15.374 --> 15:18.208
Rongo!
Telegram to Brugelbecker.

15:18.210 --> 15:20.176
"We have been bilked
with damaged goods.

15:20.178 --> 15:22.512
"This is an aberration,
travestation...

15:22.514 --> 15:25.215
"and I demand my money back."

15:25.217 --> 15:28.051
But whatever you do,
do not call the papers.

15:28.053 --> 15:30.487
We are not advertising
this baby.

15:32.257 --> 15:33.291
Tell me you didn't do it.

15:34.192 --> 15:36.192
You did it?

15:36.194 --> 15:38.328
Never do anything I tell ya

15:38.330 --> 15:40.298
without checking
with me first!

15:45.170 --> 15:47.670
Why me? Why me?

15:47.672 --> 15:49.972
A face
only a mother could love.

15:49.974 --> 15:51.141
Sir?

15:51.143 --> 15:53.443
Many of us
find you handsome.

15:53.445 --> 15:55.280
I was talking
about the elephant!

16:00.185 --> 16:02.587
Look, she's drawing him
a bath.

16:08.460 --> 16:10.326
Need a vet to come
to look at him, Max.

16:10.328 --> 16:12.127
No, no witnesses!

16:12.129 --> 16:14.029
We are going to be in Joplin
for two weeks.

16:14.031 --> 16:15.632
We promised them
a beautiful baby!

16:15.634 --> 16:18.100
You have until tomorrow
night to fix that!

16:18.102 --> 16:19.636
- Me?
- Yes, you!

16:19.638 --> 16:21.003
This is my problem?

16:21.005 --> 16:22.305
Yes.
You tend the elephants.

16:22.307 --> 16:24.175
Make those ears disappear!

16:32.417 --> 16:33.984
Don't look at me.

16:42.694 --> 16:44.654
Look at him, those
giant ears weigh him down.

16:47.766 --> 16:49.599
Hi, Baby Jumbo.

16:49.601 --> 16:51.467
Welcome to the circus.

16:51.469 --> 16:54.405
We're all family here.
No matter how small.

16:55.473 --> 16:58.040
Aren't elephants
afraid of mice?

16:58.042 --> 17:01.343
Says who?
That's why we experiment.

17:01.345 --> 17:02.544
Someone needs to
keep him company.

17:02.546 --> 17:03.748
when he's not with his momma.

17:15.626 --> 17:17.326
Look. Give him one.

17:17.328 --> 17:21.497
If he can lift his ears
out of the way.

17:21.499 --> 17:23.665
No. You have to blow
your ears out of the way.

17:23.666 --> 17:25.536
Like this.

17:29.573 --> 17:31.139
Good luck with that.

17:31.141 --> 17:33.175
Maybe you can teach him
to juggle, too.

17:33.177 --> 17:34.776
Baby Jumbo, look at me.

17:34.778 --> 17:36.111
Do what I do.

17:36.113 --> 17:37.348
Blow.

17:44.788 --> 17:48.156
No, not the feather.
Your ears. Blow!

17:48.158 --> 17:50.127
He thinks it's a game.

17:51.428 --> 17:53.195
- Oh, Max, come here.
- What?

17:53.197 --> 17:55.130
Watch this.

17:55.132 --> 17:58.300
I ride out, I do some jumps,
then all of a sudden...

17:58.302 --> 18:00.302
stampede!

18:00.304 --> 18:01.370
Send 'em!

18:03.173 --> 18:04.375
Get out of the way, Max!

18:07.611 --> 18:09.747
I'm, uh, still working out
the timing.

18:15.719 --> 18:17.354
Let me have a turn.

18:31.835 --> 18:33.468
Meanwhile, for when you

18:33.470 --> 18:34.670
- lead out the elephants...
- Uh-huh.

18:34.672 --> 18:35.771
I had the
costume departments

18:35.773 --> 18:36.872
make you up
a little something.

18:36.874 --> 18:37.874
Okay.

18:39.476 --> 18:40.809
What in gosh...

18:40.811 --> 18:42.778
You really broke the bank
with this, Max.

18:42.780 --> 18:44.412
A lot of kids
come to the show.

18:44.414 --> 18:46.213
You don't want me to
scare anyone, I get it.

18:46.215 --> 18:47.348
Dad, Dad!

18:47.350 --> 18:48.750
It's Baby Jumbo.
Come see.

18:48.752 --> 18:50.719
He jumped in the air.
With his ears.

18:50.721 --> 18:52.386
Guys,
I said leave him be.

18:52.388 --> 18:53.522
But he was this
far off the ground!

18:53.524 --> 18:54.856
Yeah, I bet he was.

18:54.858 --> 18:56.725
He'll be tripping all over
with ears like that.

18:56.727 --> 18:58.627
Dad, really.
We tried an experiment.

18:58.629 --> 19:00.330
Just leave the poor guy alone.

19:04.668 --> 19:07.568
First rule of science,
you have to have interest.

19:07.570 --> 19:09.873
Otherwise,
you don't deserve to know.

19:11.909 --> 19:15.176
It's been a rough year
for both of them.

19:15.178 --> 19:16.780
Annie knew
how to talk to 'em.

19:22.185 --> 19:23.718
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

19:23.720 --> 19:26.287
<i>boys and girls,
step right up.</i>

19:26.289 --> 19:27.421
<i>Hurry, hurry.</i>

19:27.423 --> 19:28.463
<i>Come see the circus today.</i>

19:32.863 --> 19:37.598
"To be or not to be...

19:37.600 --> 19:39.834
"that is the question.

19:39.836 --> 19:41.769
"Whether 'tis
nobler in the mind

19:41.771 --> 19:43.731
"to suffer the slings and
arrows of outrageous..."

20:01.824 --> 20:02.923
That ain't no snake.

20:02.925 --> 20:04.725
Heck, I could do it.

20:04.727 --> 20:06.360
As you wish.

20:06.362 --> 20:07.930
Get out of here!

20:09.365 --> 20:10.900
Rongo, let's go!

20:14.370 --> 20:17.206
Hey, get away
from the baby elephant!

20:39.729 --> 20:42.897
Welcome, Joplin, Missouri!

20:42.899 --> 20:44.999
Ladies and gentlemen...

20:45.001 --> 20:47.333
I am
your Master of Ceremonies,

20:47.335 --> 20:50.303
Maximilian Medici.

20:51.474 --> 20:54.608
And now, I give to you...

20:54.610 --> 20:56.977
the Medici Brothers' circus.

21:05.454 --> 21:06.687
Okay.

21:06.689 --> 21:08.488
Okay, okay,
no one's gonna hurt him.

21:08.490 --> 21:11.259
Okay, little guy,
let's put on a show.

21:37.652 --> 21:41.521
Hey, ain't that Holt Farrier,
the Stallion Star?

21:41.523 --> 21:44.925
Hey!
Ain't you Holt Farrier?

21:44.927 --> 21:47.429
Nah, he died
in the war. So sad.

21:52.634 --> 21:54.336
Aw!

21:56.738 --> 21:58.707
Aw!

22:02.410 --> 22:03.712
What's he doing?

22:10.418 --> 22:12.354
He's reaching
for the feathers.

22:20.829 --> 22:22.664
Coat, coat, coat, coat!

22:39.114 --> 22:40.814
Ooh...

22:40.816 --> 22:43.483
What'd you do to that thing?
That ain't a real elephant.

22:43.485 --> 22:45.051
Those ears are fake!

22:45.053 --> 22:46.953
Look! Look at the sign!

22:46.955 --> 22:48.757
"Dumbo!"

22:55.530 --> 22:56.896
Uh-oh.

22:56.898 --> 22:59.065
Whoa, calm down, now.

23:03.470 --> 23:04.871
He's a fake!

23:04.873 --> 23:06.139
Yeah, he's a fake!

23:06.141 --> 23:07.807
Shut up!

23:07.809 --> 23:09.609
You're scaring the elephants!

23:10.946 --> 23:12.745
Take it easy now.
Calm down.

23:12.747 --> 23:14.747
Dumbo,
Dumbo, fake, fake, fake!

23:16.718 --> 23:18.117
All right, sit down.

23:18.119 --> 23:18.885
Dumbo, Dumbo,
fake, fake, fake!

23:18.887 --> 23:19.921
I said sit down!

23:20.956 --> 23:22.090
It's okay, little fella.

23:23.825 --> 23:24.926
Fake!

23:26.795 --> 23:28.660
Rongo! Music!

23:28.662 --> 23:30.763
Happiness, joy!

23:38.173 --> 23:41.740
Hear 'em making
fun of your ugly baby?

23:41.742 --> 23:43.644
Who's gonna help him now?

23:45.947 --> 23:49.448
Holt, get those ears
off the stage!

23:52.720 --> 23:53.720
Whoa!

23:58.126 --> 24:00.059
Okay, all right.

24:00.061 --> 24:01.460
Okay, nobody's gonna
hurt your baby.

24:01.462 --> 24:03.564
Just calm down.

24:04.165 --> 24:06.531
Okay. Attagirl.

24:06.533 --> 24:08.402
We're here to protect him.
Same as you.

24:09.670 --> 24:11.670
Attagirl.

24:11.672 --> 24:12.871
Nice and easy.

24:17.011 --> 24:18.879
Shh. Okay, nobody's gonna
hurt your baby.

24:21.048 --> 24:22.583
Rufus, no!

24:24.252 --> 24:26.051
- Rufus, stop!
- Mad elephant!

24:26.053 --> 24:27.119
Get back!

24:33.527 --> 24:35.160
Max, get the kids out of here!

24:35.162 --> 24:37.029
Everybody, out!
Get to safety.

24:37.031 --> 24:38.565
Careful, careful.

24:45.739 --> 24:47.005
Kids?

24:47.007 --> 24:48.540
Go, go, go!

24:48.542 --> 24:49.641
Quick, quick, quick.
Go, go, go.

24:49.643 --> 24:50.723
Come on. This way, come on.

24:52.246 --> 24:55.049
How do you like your job now,
cowboy?

24:57.851 --> 24:58.851
Uh-oh.

25:02.723 --> 25:04.558
Milly, Joe! Come on!

25:06.293 --> 25:07.761
Let's go!
Come on!

25:41.561 --> 25:42.894
And I wanna
just emphasize,

25:42.896 --> 25:44.562
we did everything right.

25:44.564 --> 25:46.564
What it is, the tent
just absolutely fell down.

25:46.566 --> 25:47.966
It just collapsed.

25:47.968 --> 25:49.968
And we had no way of knowing
what was gonna happen.

27:56.863 --> 27:59.430
Brugelbecker,
I have a man dead,

27:59.432 --> 28:00.797
do you understand?

28:00.799 --> 28:02.433
This is what they're reading

28:02.435 --> 28:04.001
from the Great Lakes
to the Gulf!

28:04.003 --> 28:06.070
You have
a moral responsibility

28:06.072 --> 28:08.072
to buy
your killer elephant back.

28:08.074 --> 28:10.241
What about the baby?

28:10.243 --> 28:13.310
Well, at least
he got a few laughs.

28:13.312 --> 28:14.911
I'll put him
in the clown act,

28:14.913 --> 28:17.083
see if I can
salvage something.

28:19.252 --> 28:20.919
I'll buy her back half price.

28:22.488 --> 28:25.156
You will buy her back
full price.

28:25.158 --> 28:26.390
Quarter price.

28:26.392 --> 28:28.925
Half price it is!

28:34.333 --> 28:35.700
Up!

28:39.037 --> 28:40.870
What's happening?
Where are they taking her?

28:40.872 --> 28:42.071
Away.
Back to your tent now.

28:42.073 --> 28:43.873
But she's his mom!

28:43.875 --> 28:45.842
Dad, please.
Stop them.

28:45.844 --> 28:47.110
Please!

28:47.112 --> 28:48.512
Do something.

28:48.514 --> 28:50.182
Mom would have
done something.

28:51.049 --> 28:52.717
Momma's not here.

28:57.789 --> 29:01.157
Okay, little fella.
Okay. Come on.

29:03.429 --> 29:06.029
I know, I do.

29:06.031 --> 29:10.266
Beautiful creature,
we'll take care of your son.

30:31.915 --> 30:33.218
Darlin', it's late.

30:34.452 --> 30:36.086
Go on now.

31:28.972 --> 31:33.008
I know.
I can't sleep, either.

31:33.010 --> 31:35.377
My momma told me
there'd be times

31:35.379 --> 31:39.548
when my life seemed
locked behind a door.

31:39.550 --> 31:45.954
So, she gave me this key,
that her momma gave her.

31:45.956 --> 31:49.458
And said
whenever I have that feeling,

31:49.460 --> 31:51.526
imagine that door...

31:51.528 --> 31:52.629
and just turn the key.

31:55.599 --> 31:57.501
So, I keep trying.

32:05.509 --> 32:07.709
Not supposed to
be in here alone.

32:07.711 --> 32:09.678
I'm not. You're here.

32:09.680 --> 32:11.246
What's that?

32:11.248 --> 32:13.715
I just thought
he might be hungry.

32:13.717 --> 32:15.319
He's sad.

32:16.487 --> 32:18.019
You don't eat
when you're sad.

32:18.021 --> 32:19.356
The mermaid does.

32:21.258 --> 32:23.058
Come on.

32:23.060 --> 32:25.494
Have one, Dumbo.

32:25.496 --> 32:27.496
We're calling him Dumbo now?

32:27.498 --> 32:29.631
If we call him
Jumbo Junior...

32:29.633 --> 32:32.202
it might make him
miss his mom.

32:37.541 --> 32:41.610
Here you go... Dumbo.

32:41.612 --> 32:44.413
Come on,
and flap those ears again.

32:44.415 --> 32:46.517
To show us
we didn't imagine it.

32:51.053 --> 32:54.190
Your momma, she didn't
mean to hurt anyone.

32:55.191 --> 32:57.325
She was just protecting you.

32:57.327 --> 32:59.962
And we think
your ears are great.

33:04.601 --> 33:07.569
Maybe he wants to be alone.
Like Dad.

33:07.571 --> 33:09.573
Nobody wants to be alone.

33:10.541 --> 33:11.541
Well...

33:13.309 --> 33:15.111
if you change your mind...

33:18.181 --> 33:19.650
Night-night, Dumbo.

33:49.545 --> 33:50.545
Wow!

33:54.584 --> 33:56.717
It's not the peanuts
that made him do it.

33:56.719 --> 33:58.087
It's the feathers!

34:05.061 --> 34:06.229
Dumbo!

34:36.324 --> 34:38.726
Dumbo, you gotta do this
in the show.

34:38.728 --> 34:40.427
What do you mean?

34:40.429 --> 34:41.795
'Cause if the circus
sells more tickets

34:41.797 --> 34:43.230
and Medici makes
more money...

34:43.232 --> 34:44.398
then we can get him
to use some

34:44.400 --> 34:45.399
to buy Mrs. Jumbo back.

34:45.400 --> 34:46.567
Yeah!

34:46.569 --> 34:49.135
We can get her back, Dumbo.
You can.

34:49.137 --> 34:50.838
Just show them all
what you can do.

34:50.840 --> 34:52.438
Come on.
We gotta tell Dad.

34:52.440 --> 34:55.309
No. He'll just tell us
to be practical.

34:55.311 --> 34:57.278
Shows got canceled
for a week, right?

34:57.280 --> 34:59.315
We can research
and study and test.

35:00.883 --> 35:04.150
You're a miracle elephant,
Dumbo.

35:04.152 --> 35:06.289
And we're gonna
bring your momma home.

35:09.157 --> 35:11.124
Fire!

35:32.314 --> 35:33.714
So low.

35:33.716 --> 35:35.381
An all-time low.

35:35.383 --> 35:37.317
Who said he didn't want
to be recognized?

35:39.154 --> 35:42.522
Okay, Big D, this is it.
Just like in rehearsal.

35:42.524 --> 35:44.557
Except for lights, music,
fire and crowds.

35:44.559 --> 35:46.428
- You can do it.
- Come on, Dumbo.

35:48.396 --> 35:49.630
You can do it, Dumbo!

35:49.632 --> 35:50.872
Show 'em all
like you showed us!

35:55.403 --> 35:57.905
- Come! Come! Come!
- Attaboy, come on.

35:57.907 --> 35:59.873
Keep comin'. Come on.

36:05.680 --> 36:07.716
Go on now, Dumbo!
Come on.

36:09.718 --> 36:11.250
Whoa.

36:15.724 --> 36:17.523
Hey! Hey!

36:39.247 --> 36:41.549
They love it! They love it!

36:45.387 --> 36:46.519
All right, Dumbo.

36:46.521 --> 36:47.722
You put out the fire.

37:05.907 --> 37:07.573
He won't fly.
He's scared.

37:07.575 --> 37:09.409
I know.
Now, he's up too high.

37:16.551 --> 37:17.552
Go on, Dumbo!

37:32.567 --> 37:33.768
Attaboy.

37:36.336 --> 37:38.538
Yeah!
Rule Number One.

37:38.540 --> 37:40.307
"Always have a big finish!"

37:42.610 --> 37:45.477
Aw!

37:49.383 --> 37:51.485
Okay, guys.
Bring him down.

37:52.754 --> 37:53.755
Yeah!

38:04.531 --> 38:06.866
Holt!

38:06.868 --> 38:08.500
- Look, Max!
- What? What?

38:08.502 --> 38:10.270
- He's trapped up there.
- Put the fire out!

38:12.740 --> 38:14.006
Dumbo! Fly!

38:14.008 --> 38:16.443
He won't fly
without a feather!

38:20.414 --> 38:22.481
Put the fire out!

38:22.483 --> 38:23.584
Put it out!

38:24.953 --> 38:26.651
- Joe!
- Stop!

38:28.022 --> 38:30.758
Holt, I thought she didn't
want to be in an act.

38:33.861 --> 38:35.141
Milly!

38:51.779 --> 38:53.445
Here, Dumbo!

38:53.447 --> 38:54.948
Come on.

38:55.649 --> 38:56.683
Show 'em.

38:58.452 --> 38:59.720
Come on, Dumbo.

39:26.847 --> 39:27.979
Fly, Dumbo.

39:27.981 --> 39:28.981
Fly!

39:41.161 --> 39:42.596
Whoa!

39:45.799 --> 39:46.967
Yeah!

40:22.468 --> 40:24.169
You knew
he could do this?

40:24.171 --> 40:26.472
You should talk
to your kids more.

40:37.050 --> 40:38.216
Sotheby...

40:38.218 --> 40:40.451
cancel my dinner
with the president.

40:40.453 --> 40:42.722
We've got business
with an elephant.

40:45.658 --> 40:47.491
Friends,

40:47.493 --> 40:50.761
the next available shows
are in Arkansas!

40:51.797 --> 40:53.064
<i>♪ Happy clowns!</i>

40:57.637 --> 41:01.139
- Ah, Rongo the Strong!
- Boss.

41:01.141 --> 41:02.673
Hello, Jo!

41:02.675 --> 41:05.042
The Medici Brothers' circus.

41:05.044 --> 41:08.981
Where true love
and mystery abound!

41:10.250 --> 41:12.049
Now where's my star?

41:12.051 --> 41:15.185
Ah, Dumbo!

41:15.187 --> 41:16.520
How's your bath?

41:16.522 --> 41:18.555
Too warm? Too cold?

41:18.557 --> 41:21.759
Ladies, make sure his wrinkles
don't get wrinkles.

41:21.761 --> 41:24.161
In our country,
legend tells us

41:24.163 --> 41:26.931
the gods can
take animal forms.

41:26.933 --> 41:28.699
Champagne for Dumbo!

41:28.701 --> 41:30.770
No booze near the baby!

41:52.825 --> 41:53.993
Sorry, Dumbo.

41:55.261 --> 41:56.660
It's not your momma.

41:56.662 --> 41:58.297
Take Dumbo back inside.

42:08.841 --> 42:10.140
Ladies and gentlemen,
please make way

42:10.142 --> 42:11.909
for the emperor
of enchantment.

42:11.911 --> 42:13.243
For the architect of dreams.

42:13.245 --> 42:15.578
For the Columbus
of Coney Island.

42:15.580 --> 42:17.547
Mr. V.A. Vandevere!

42:21.320 --> 42:25.022
And traveling with him,
his bright shining star.

42:25.024 --> 42:28.591
Colette Marchant,
the Queen of the Heavens!

42:28.593 --> 42:30.127
Miss Marchant!
Miss Marchant!

42:33.631 --> 42:34.699
Ah.

42:35.633 --> 42:37.036
<i>Signore</i> Medici!

42:37.903 --> 42:39.569
He knows who I am.

42:39.571 --> 42:41.105
We were just
passing through Missouri...

42:41.107 --> 42:43.140
and we heard you were
putting on a little show.

42:43.142 --> 42:46.843
Mr. Vandevere.
It's an honor.

42:46.845 --> 42:49.814
No, sir.
The honor is mine.

42:52.318 --> 42:53.883
I would like
to offer you a drink.

42:53.885 --> 42:56.220
But I'm all out of bourbon.

42:58.157 --> 43:00.590
And cognac and scotch.

43:06.765 --> 43:09.166
Not now!

43:10.635 --> 43:12.204
Is that a monkey
in your desk?

43:13.172 --> 43:14.704
Just for emergencies.

43:14.706 --> 43:17.006
Look, Mr. Vandevere...

43:17.008 --> 43:18.775
I probably should tell you...

43:18.777 --> 43:21.177
the elephant is not for sale.

43:21.179 --> 43:23.813
Dumbo will only fly
for the Medici circus.

43:23.815 --> 43:26.151
That's assuming he is real.

43:33.258 --> 43:34.757
See for yourself.

43:34.759 --> 43:37.126
And all due respect,
I don't got all day.

43:37.128 --> 43:38.696
- Pleasure to meet you...
- Excuse me.

43:39.864 --> 43:40.899
Hello there.

43:48.940 --> 43:51.107
So this, uh,
creature of yours...

43:51.109 --> 43:52.844
is supposed to fly?

43:54.279 --> 43:55.878
Trade secrets.

43:59.417 --> 44:00.685
Ugh.

44:05.690 --> 44:08.658
Uh, Max,
if you don't mind my asking...

44:08.660 --> 44:13.129
where did you
come upon the animal?

44:13.131 --> 44:15.298
He hails
from the far east.

44:15.300 --> 44:16.732
How far?

44:16.734 --> 44:18.134
Far.

44:18.136 --> 44:21.104
He doesn't look
like "magic" to me.

44:21.106 --> 44:23.806
Well, what the heck can you
tell by appearances, right?

44:23.808 --> 44:26.809
And you train
flying elephants, too?

44:26.811 --> 44:28.291
Yeah, it's a little hobby
on the side.

44:31.449 --> 44:33.151
It's the kids taught Dumbo.

44:35.719 --> 44:37.754
Ah, yes.

44:41.226 --> 44:42.391
Yeah?

44:42.393 --> 44:46.028
And how on earth
did you do that?

44:46.030 --> 44:47.430
With the
scientific method.

44:49.367 --> 44:51.766
One picture, one picture!

44:51.768 --> 44:53.469
Max.

44:53.471 --> 44:56.272
You possess something
that's very rare in life.

44:56.274 --> 44:58.974
And the tragedy of it is,

44:58.976 --> 45:01.877
is you don't even know
that you have it.

45:01.879 --> 45:04.480
Do you know what it is
that you have, Max?

45:04.482 --> 45:05.747
No.

45:05.749 --> 45:07.050
It's mystique.

45:08.286 --> 45:10.986
Max, I know your type.

45:10.988 --> 45:13.356
Charlatan, con man,
opportunist...

45:13.358 --> 45:16.425
New York is that way,
in case you need directions.

45:16.427 --> 45:18.994
And I know it comes
from a deep desire

45:18.996 --> 45:20.929
to build something
authentic and true.

45:20.931 --> 45:22.764
I know your game.

45:22.766 --> 45:24.099
It's not a game.

45:24.101 --> 45:27.405
Some men cheat the rules,
others change them.

45:28.739 --> 45:29.940
It's up your sleeve.

45:31.141 --> 45:33.010
It's in your pocket.

45:40.250 --> 45:41.816
The secret
to show business

45:41.818 --> 45:43.386
is always keep a rabbit
in your hat.

45:43.388 --> 45:46.023
Or a monkey in your desk,
I guess.

45:47.758 --> 45:49.157
Ownership shares?

45:49.159 --> 45:50.426
Max, look around you.

45:50.428 --> 45:52.861
Your entire way of life
is dying.

45:52.863 --> 45:54.429
The future of the
entertainment business

45:54.431 --> 45:56.264
is to bring
the audience to you.

45:56.266 --> 45:58.200
And I've built
that destination.

45:58.202 --> 46:00.835
What I'm lacking...

46:00.837 --> 46:02.973
is a protege.

46:06.043 --> 46:09.146
I know
there's no Medici Brothers.

46:10.347 --> 46:13.217
You probably always
wanted one.

46:14.418 --> 46:16.017
You're offering me
a partnership?

46:16.019 --> 46:17.185
Yes.

46:17.187 --> 46:19.020
And a home.

46:19.022 --> 46:21.022
For you
and the entire troupe.

46:21.024 --> 46:24.125
A home?
For all of us?

46:24.127 --> 46:26.461
Yes. Join me.

46:26.463 --> 46:28.563
Join me and my family.

46:28.565 --> 46:31.333
Let me take us all
into the future.

46:31.335 --> 46:33.337
Let me take us all...

46:34.471 --> 46:36.306
to Dreamland!

47:19.249 --> 47:22.016
I wish Momma
could've seen this.

47:22.018 --> 47:24.288
Well, somehow,
I think she knows we're here.

47:29.959 --> 47:32.061
Way to work your magic, Max.

47:42.572 --> 47:45.172
We hear you, Dumbo!

47:45.174 --> 47:46.641
Why won't you
let him see outside?

47:46.643 --> 47:49.109
Remember, young lady...

47:49.111 --> 47:50.313
mystique.

47:54.518 --> 47:56.852
Now this is why
I joined the circus.

48:00.423 --> 48:03.123
Dad.
Wonders of Science!

48:03.125 --> 48:04.391
All right, sugar plum.

48:04.393 --> 48:06.193
Remember, we got
a job to do here.

48:06.195 --> 48:08.929
My daughter, she fancies
herself the next Marie Curie.

48:08.931 --> 48:12.634
Don't ever let anybody
tell you what you can't do.

48:12.636 --> 48:15.402
Hang on,
I wasn't saying she can't.

48:15.404 --> 48:19.940
What is it exactly that
we do here, <i>ma cherie?</i>

48:19.942 --> 48:23.479
We make
the impossible possible.

48:28.551 --> 48:30.150
And that's where
you'll perform.

48:30.152 --> 48:31.452
The Colosseum!

48:31.454 --> 48:34.421
Dumbo will stay
in the training tent behind.

48:34.423 --> 48:35.522
Dumbo!

48:41.130 --> 48:42.596
Why aren't we
going with him?

48:42.598 --> 48:46.469
Because that
is your new home.

48:52.108 --> 48:53.142
Wow!

48:54.343 --> 48:56.176
Look at this place!

48:56.178 --> 48:57.544
A library...

48:57.546 --> 48:59.580
"And the children
shall lead them."

48:59.582 --> 49:01.615
We're grateful for the
opportunity, Mr. Vandevere.

49:01.617 --> 49:04.651
Oh, your family's mine.

49:07.056 --> 49:10.691
You know, I've been brushing
up on your story, Mr. Farrier.

49:10.693 --> 49:12.992
Kentucky's top trick rider.

49:12.994 --> 49:14.395
Well, there's no reason
you can't be again...

49:14.397 --> 49:17.564
only here,
you'd be Captain Farrier...

49:17.566 --> 49:18.699
war hero.

49:21.437 --> 49:22.503
One-armed wonder.

49:22.505 --> 49:24.038
National treasure.

49:24.673 --> 49:26.139
Wow!

49:26.141 --> 49:27.408
Well, I still can ride.

49:27.410 --> 49:28.609
Oh, I know you can.

49:28.611 --> 49:31.077
And you're going to.

49:31.079 --> 49:32.513
Right after you get
that little elephant

49:32.515 --> 49:33.747
off the ground for me.

49:33.749 --> 49:35.549
You mean
once his act's working?

49:35.551 --> 49:37.317
You're back in the saddle.

49:37.319 --> 49:39.319
We're still working
on the schedule

49:39.321 --> 49:40.454
for the rest
of your troupe...

49:40.456 --> 49:42.489
but on Friday...

49:42.491 --> 49:44.225
we premiere
our little Dumbo.

49:46.695 --> 49:48.664
I get goose bumps.

49:51.199 --> 49:53.434
Why are you
looking at me?

49:53.436 --> 49:55.301
Well, because
the only thing

49:55.303 --> 49:58.405
more amazing
than a flying elephant...

49:58.407 --> 49:59.941
is the goddess
who can fly it.

50:01.544 --> 50:03.610
Have you lost your mind?

50:06.482 --> 50:09.518
Let's not forget from
whence we came, darling.

50:11.587 --> 50:13.587
So, we fly Friday!

50:13.589 --> 50:17.724
Uh, Dumbo's never flown
with anyone.

50:17.726 --> 50:20.694
That's why it's become
abundantly clear

50:20.696 --> 50:21.697
why we need you.

50:24.032 --> 50:25.364
Dumbo!

50:29.504 --> 50:31.504
Hey, buddy. We missed you.
You all right?

50:31.506 --> 50:34.307
Hey. Captain Farrier
is in charge.

50:34.309 --> 50:36.244
No one sees the animal
without his approval.

50:36.678 --> 50:37.710
Holt.

50:37.712 --> 50:39.247
Just call me Holt.

50:40.582 --> 50:42.582
I thought you were
a military man.

50:42.584 --> 50:45.051
Nice boots you bagged there.
What are they, shark skin?

50:45.053 --> 50:48.054
No.

50:48.056 --> 50:49.322
So you better keep
your elephant friend

50:49.324 --> 50:50.658
on my good side.

50:56.164 --> 50:57.164
Hiya, Dumbo.

51:04.305 --> 51:06.339
Dumbo, you mind?

51:06.341 --> 51:07.442
Can I get my arm?

51:09.244 --> 51:11.244
And these are the hands
I'll be putting my life in?

51:11.713 --> 51:13.613
Welcome.

51:13.615 --> 51:16.215
For the record,
this was not my idea.

51:16.217 --> 51:17.683
Dumbo works alone.

51:17.685 --> 51:19.287
So do I.

51:21.322 --> 51:22.524
<i>Bonjour,</i> Milly, Joe...

51:24.192 --> 51:25.791
And you...

51:28.863 --> 51:30.429
Hmm, charming.

51:30.431 --> 51:31.697
Well, maybe he doesn't
recognize you

51:31.699 --> 51:34.233
without your makeup.

51:34.235 --> 51:36.101
So I gotta
teach you to fly?

51:36.103 --> 51:40.439
I know how to fly,
ever since I was a child.

51:40.441 --> 51:42.742
They taught
Dumbo to fly, no?

51:42.744 --> 51:44.479
So I don't need
your expertise.

51:46.281 --> 51:48.581
All right.

51:48.583 --> 51:51.216
Well, just so you know,
I've been to France.

51:51.218 --> 51:52.785
It wasn't a good experience.

51:52.787 --> 51:54.754
Show me your secret!

51:54.756 --> 51:56.789
How on earth
does your elephant fly?

51:56.791 --> 51:59.192
Well, first,
he needs a feather.

52:00.360 --> 52:02.062
He won't fly
without a feather.

52:03.263 --> 52:06.331
Well then,
neither will I.

52:34.161 --> 52:35.828
Whoa, slow down, princess.
Safety first.

52:35.830 --> 52:37.162
Guys, nets.

52:37.164 --> 52:38.332
Come on, hurry.

52:41.501 --> 52:43.236
All right, guys, good.

52:52.212 --> 52:53.680
See, Dumbo?

52:54.849 --> 52:56.884
I fly!

53:05.425 --> 53:07.127
See if you can catch me!

53:09.964 --> 53:11.463
Here, Dumbo!

54:11.658 --> 54:13.960
Oh, we got some work to do.

54:23.737 --> 54:25.036
Friends and colleagues...

54:25.038 --> 54:26.437
let's give a warm
Dreamland welcome

54:26.439 --> 54:27.806
to our new executive
vice president...

54:27.808 --> 54:28.808
Mr. Max Medici.

54:31.712 --> 54:33.812
Anything he needs,
anything at all...

54:33.814 --> 54:35.749
make it happen
as you always do.

54:40.553 --> 54:42.286
This is Miss Verna.

54:42.288 --> 54:43.654
She will handle
your schedule,

54:43.656 --> 54:46.024
correspondence,
and all your calls.

54:46.026 --> 54:47.792
When you're needed
in meetings,

54:47.794 --> 54:49.393
she'll let you know.

54:49.395 --> 54:50.762
Are there meetings today?

54:50.764 --> 54:52.496
I'll let you know!

54:54.768 --> 54:56.633
Uh, Mr. Vandevere,
one question.

54:56.635 --> 54:58.839
Exactly what do I do?

55:03.043 --> 55:05.377
So where'd
Vandevere find you?

55:07.080 --> 55:08.915
I was a street performer
in Paris.

55:10.516 --> 55:11.916
He discovered me.

55:11.918 --> 55:13.719
And here I am.

55:15.888 --> 55:17.788
A millionaire's girlfriend.

55:17.790 --> 55:18.992
That's a tough break.

55:20.726 --> 55:22.760
It's all for show.

55:22.762 --> 55:25.429
So you and he,
you're not, uh...

55:25.431 --> 55:27.098
I'm one of many
gems he wears

55:27.100 --> 55:28.634
to reflect the light
back onto him.

55:29.902 --> 55:30.903
Huh.

55:32.638 --> 55:34.571
Good boy, Dumbo.

55:34.573 --> 55:36.373
- Good job.
- Yeah! They're gonna love him.

55:36.375 --> 55:37.877
I think you are
the lucky one.

55:40.446 --> 55:42.012
- Well done, Dumbo.
- Good boy.

55:42.014 --> 55:45.351
Who's been dreaming
like I've been dreaming?

55:46.819 --> 55:49.386
So, how's everything?

55:49.388 --> 55:51.088
- Good?
- Oh, we're making progress.

55:51.090 --> 55:52.823
But he ain't
quite ready yet.

55:52.825 --> 55:55.592
What's the problem?
Doesn't the animal trust you?

55:55.594 --> 55:57.961
- It's not that simple.
- <i>Ma cherie...</i>

55:57.963 --> 56:01.665
we've already sold
all the tickets.

56:01.667 --> 56:03.467
Maybe our little
scientist here

56:03.469 --> 56:05.337
can show us
that it's going to work.

56:18.017 --> 56:19.616
Prepare for takeoff.

56:19.618 --> 56:20.786
- Right wing?
- Check!

56:22.755 --> 56:23.887
Left wing?

56:23.889 --> 56:25.856
Check!

56:25.858 --> 56:27.960
Take her up, Dumbo.

56:31.864 --> 56:33.630
Let's go.

56:33.632 --> 56:35.832
- Come on, buddy. Come on.
- Come on, Dumbo.

56:37.069 --> 56:38.904
That's it. Come on.

56:45.577 --> 56:46.642
Let's try it again.

56:48.546 --> 56:50.381
You got this.
Here you go.

57:05.030 --> 57:07.432
You beautiful
one-armed cowboy.

57:08.700 --> 57:10.870
You've made me
a child again.

57:22.747 --> 57:25.781
<i>Welcome to the Colosseum...</i>

57:25.783 --> 57:28.553
<i>where the impossible
is possible.</i>

58:11.529 --> 58:15.097
<i>Buonasera.</i> Max Medici.

58:15.099 --> 58:17.533
I discovered the elephant,
my elephant.

58:17.535 --> 58:18.868
And basically I said no.

58:18.870 --> 58:20.569
I walked out and that
was the end of that.

58:20.571 --> 58:21.904
The flying
elephant's mine.

58:21.906 --> 58:22.907
Yeah.

58:24.108 --> 58:25.942
You're the guy!

58:25.944 --> 58:28.744
You're the guy that's
made out of magic dust!

58:28.746 --> 58:29.979
Max.

58:29.981 --> 58:32.548
J. Griffin Remington.
Atlas Forge Bank.

58:32.550 --> 58:34.850
He's the money man.

58:34.852 --> 58:36.118
The J?

58:36.120 --> 58:38.955
Whoa! It's a pleasure
to meet you.

58:38.957 --> 58:40.756
How are you?

58:40.758 --> 58:42.091
You know, they say the moon
is made out of magic dust.

58:42.093 --> 58:43.693
That's why
they're going to send

58:43.695 --> 58:45.127
a man up there
one of these days.

58:45.129 --> 58:47.296
And my bank is
going to be the bank

58:47.298 --> 58:50.032
that finances
the expedition.

58:50.034 --> 58:51.167
What do you think of that?

58:51.169 --> 58:52.567
Uh-huh.

58:52.569 --> 58:53.903
Needless to say, Max...

58:53.905 --> 58:55.771
we all have high hopes
for tonight.

58:55.773 --> 58:58.741
Oh, yeah. High hopes.
High hopes.

58:58.743 --> 59:00.575
Well, you know,
hopes, and dreams,

59:00.577 --> 59:02.044
that's one thing.
That's words.

59:02.046 --> 59:04.213
But what we're talking
about here is facts!

59:04.215 --> 59:05.547
Plans!

59:05.549 --> 59:07.883
Plans! That takes
a lot of money.

59:07.885 --> 59:09.584
Which he hasn't got!

59:09.586 --> 59:11.187
So, we are hoping
that your pachyderm

59:11.189 --> 59:13.055
comes through
with the goods.

59:13.057 --> 59:15.958
Now let's get this show
on the road!

59:22.733 --> 59:24.135
We are looking good!

59:25.635 --> 59:27.336
Don't worry, Big D.

59:27.338 --> 59:29.105
There's just more room to fly out
there, that's all.

59:29.107 --> 59:31.673
Round and round,
just like we practiced.

59:31.675 --> 59:34.076
And then Dad can talk
to Vandevere about the deal!

59:34.078 --> 59:35.144
About the what?

59:35.146 --> 59:36.678
We made a deal with Dumbo.

59:36.680 --> 59:38.114
We promised we'd buy
his mom back

59:38.116 --> 59:39.748
with all the money
he makes for the circus.

59:39.750 --> 59:40.884
That's why he flies.

59:42.120 --> 59:44.619
- Joe, not now!
- Are we ready?

59:44.621 --> 59:45.856
Yeah.

59:52.263 --> 59:53.828
Okay, let's go.

59:53.830 --> 59:56.533
Okay, Dumbo, let's do this.

01:00:55.725 --> 01:00:57.392
Pink elephants?

01:00:57.394 --> 01:00:58.829
So?

01:01:57.953 --> 01:02:02.856
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls of all ages!</i>

01:02:02.858 --> 01:02:06.960
<i>This is the moment
we've all been waiting for!</i>

01:02:06.962 --> 01:02:09.096
<i>V.A. Vandevere,</i>

01:02:09.098 --> 01:02:11.299
<i>in association
with Max Medici...</i>

01:02:11.301 --> 01:02:15.969
<i>proudly presents,
making his Dreamland debut...</i>

01:02:15.971 --> 01:02:18.373
<i>You've seen a horse-fly.</i>

01:02:18.375 --> 01:02:21.041
<i>You've seen a dragonfly.</i>

01:02:21.043 --> 01:02:23.977
<i>You've even seen a housefly.</i>

01:02:23.979 --> 01:02:26.146
<i>But you haven't
seen anything...</i>

01:02:26.148 --> 01:02:30.083
<i>until you see
an elephant fly.</i>

01:02:30.085 --> 01:02:33.053
<i>Let's get ready for Dumbo!</i>

01:02:50.272 --> 01:02:51.840
Coming through.

01:02:53.142 --> 01:02:54.843
Come on.

01:03:13.162 --> 01:03:14.263
He can do it.

01:03:16.899 --> 01:03:18.100
I know he can.

01:03:22.905 --> 01:03:24.938
<i>And here to welcome him...</i>

01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:29.977
<i>our own Queen of the Heavens!</i>

01:04:20.995 --> 01:04:23.929
Dumbo.

01:04:23.931 --> 01:04:27.201
Five times around the ring.
That's all we have to do.

01:04:28.404 --> 01:04:29.837
Nice and easy,
like we practiced.

01:04:36.545 --> 01:04:38.210
- Dad?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:04:38.212 --> 01:04:39.612
Why aren't they
putting up the nets?

01:04:42.383 --> 01:04:43.983
Hey, guys?

01:04:43.985 --> 01:04:45.318
Guys, what's going on?

01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:46.520
Your men are supposed
to be out there!

01:04:46.522 --> 01:04:47.642
Change of plan.
From the top.

01:04:58.433 --> 01:05:01.133
I can't see the nets.

01:05:01.135 --> 01:05:03.504
- They're invisible.
- Hmm.

01:05:04.972 --> 01:05:06.574
What's wrong with you?
They need nets!

01:05:08.976 --> 01:05:09.909
Colette!

01:05:09.911 --> 01:05:11.412
Wait, don't take off!

01:05:13.214 --> 01:05:14.447
Dumbo...

01:05:14.449 --> 01:05:15.481
Oh, boy!

01:05:15.483 --> 01:05:17.151
...Prince of the Elephants.

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:21.956
I command you
to fly with me.

01:05:53.019 --> 01:05:54.186
Colette!

01:06:10.204 --> 01:06:11.604
Lower the platform!

01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:31.992
Fly, little one!

01:06:51.478 --> 01:06:53.146
Magic dust!

01:07:21.041 --> 01:07:22.242
Where's my show?

01:07:45.065 --> 01:07:47.732
The elephant's headed
to Nightmare Island.

01:08:07.687 --> 01:08:10.357
Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:47.792
Dumbo, it's okay.

01:08:47.794 --> 01:08:49.662
We're here.

01:08:50.697 --> 01:08:52.162
Good evening.

01:08:52.163 --> 01:08:53.631
It's Mr. Vandevere.

01:08:53.633 --> 01:08:54.832
- Hello, hi.
- Hey, that's V.A. Vandevere!

01:08:54.834 --> 01:08:56.166
Everyone having fun?

01:08:56.167 --> 01:08:57.535
Good.

01:08:57.537 --> 01:08:59.303
- Having a good time?
- Yes, sir.

01:08:59.305 --> 01:09:01.138
Fantastic.

01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:03.608
Get him outta here.

01:09:03.609 --> 01:09:05.207
- Yes.
- Over here!

01:09:05.210 --> 01:09:06.542
- Folks, please.
- Hello.

01:09:06.545 --> 01:09:08.345
Folks, I need you
to leave the exhibit.

01:09:08.346 --> 01:09:10.381
Come on.

01:09:12.318 --> 01:09:13.917
Guys, guys, go easy,
he's just a baby.

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:16.286
Soldier,
I give the orders here.

01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:25.462
It's his bedtime.

01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:29.733
<i>This attraction is now closed.</i>

01:09:36.910 --> 01:09:38.508
Dad?

01:09:38.510 --> 01:09:39.645
Uh-huh.

01:09:40.546 --> 01:09:42.281
It's Mrs. Jumbo.

01:09:48.187 --> 01:09:50.287
Come on,
I want to see Dumbo!

01:09:50.288 --> 01:09:51.755
I want to see Dumbo!

01:09:51.756 --> 01:09:52.689
I want my money back!

01:09:52.691 --> 01:09:53.857
I don't understand.

01:09:53.859 --> 01:09:56.293
The elephant flies.
You saw it.

01:09:56.295 --> 01:09:57.894
I saw a vanishing act.

01:09:57.896 --> 01:10:01.498
I'm not investing one cent
until I can see this works.

01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:03.800
You can't control
your animal.

01:10:03.802 --> 01:10:05.936
You give me a little time,
I can fix this.

01:10:05.938 --> 01:10:09.441
Whatever! Till then,
the bank is closed.

01:10:13.912 --> 01:10:15.212
What happened up there?

01:10:15.214 --> 01:10:16.446
You lost control
of the animal.

01:10:16.448 --> 01:10:17.447
You're the animal.

01:10:17.449 --> 01:10:18.782
Where was my net?

01:10:18.784 --> 01:10:21.251
Nets are for rehearsal.
This is the show.

01:10:23.922 --> 01:10:26.323
Training?
You call that training?

01:10:26.325 --> 01:10:28.825
Now, hold on, Mr. Vandevere,
we know why he flew away.

01:10:28.827 --> 01:10:30.827
He recognized
that other elephant's call.

01:10:30.829 --> 01:10:32.929
The one on Nightmare Island.
It's his momma!

01:10:32.931 --> 01:10:34.698
It's true.
It's her.

01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:35.999
She was sold from our
circus two months ago.

01:10:36.001 --> 01:10:37.534
Every child
knows its mother.

01:10:37.536 --> 01:10:40.003
And they say
elephants never forget.

01:10:40.005 --> 01:10:42.271
They can be
together now.

01:10:42.273 --> 01:10:43.974
Why are there children
in my office?

01:10:43.976 --> 01:10:47.911
Mr. Vandevere, please,
all Dumbo wants is his momma.

01:10:47.913 --> 01:10:49.311
Just reunite them,

01:10:49.313 --> 01:10:50.747
and he'll do
whatever you want.

01:10:50.749 --> 01:10:53.884
No, he'll do
whatever she wants.

01:10:53.886 --> 01:10:55.452
You think
I'd have bought her

01:10:55.454 --> 01:10:57.921
if I thought she was
related to him? Hmm?

01:10:57.923 --> 01:11:00.458
Doesn't help me at all.

01:11:04.897 --> 01:11:06.530
You wanna know
the most important thing

01:11:06.532 --> 01:11:07.866
about growing up?

01:11:09.534 --> 01:11:13.739
You've got to learn
to go it alone.

01:11:16.809 --> 01:11:19.442
Get rid of the mother.
You know where to take her.

01:11:19.444 --> 01:11:20.844
And treat yourself
to some new boots.

01:11:20.846 --> 01:11:23.214
But, sir,
you can't just kill her.

01:11:23.716 --> 01:11:24.881
Why not?

01:11:24.883 --> 01:11:26.348
Mr. Vandevere.

01:11:26.350 --> 01:11:28.617
Wait!
Don't separate 'em, please.

01:11:28.619 --> 01:11:30.653
Don't do that to my kids.

01:11:30.655 --> 01:11:33.023
You know, Holt,
when my father left us,

01:11:33.025 --> 01:11:34.657
it was a blessing really.

01:11:34.659 --> 01:11:37.660
Because I had to learn
how to fend for myself.

01:11:37.662 --> 01:11:40.063
Maybe that's what
your children need.

01:11:40.065 --> 01:11:41.564
Don't tell me
what my children need.

01:11:41.566 --> 01:11:43.001
Best take a step back,
Elephant Man.

01:11:45.336 --> 01:11:46.937
Darling...

01:11:46.939 --> 01:11:51.340
Dumbo and his mom
need a little alone time.

01:11:51.342 --> 01:11:53.609
So, Mommy's going to
take a little trip...

01:11:53.611 --> 01:11:55.680
so that Dumbo
won't be distracted.

01:11:58.449 --> 01:12:00.885
Milly! Milly!

01:12:13.898 --> 01:12:14.932
Colette?

01:12:16.734 --> 01:12:18.002
I have rehearsal.

01:12:19.670 --> 01:12:20.738
Max.

01:12:26.010 --> 01:12:27.576
<i>Nightmare Island.</i>

01:12:27.578 --> 01:12:29.378
Milly?

01:12:29.380 --> 01:12:31.013
<i>Home of the most dangerous
beasts in the world.</i>

01:12:31.015 --> 01:12:32.683
Sir, park's closing.

01:12:39.824 --> 01:12:40.925
Milly!

01:12:44.929 --> 01:12:45.930
Milly!

01:12:50.835 --> 01:12:52.870
Did you find her?

01:12:53.671 --> 01:12:54.672
No.

01:12:57.942 --> 01:13:01.777
Well, her momma always knew
what to say. No matter what.

01:13:01.779 --> 01:13:03.946
She always knew.

01:13:03.948 --> 01:13:07.516
Your children don't need you
to be perfect.

01:13:07.518 --> 01:13:09.720
They just need you
to believe in them.

01:13:11.388 --> 01:13:12.857
That simple, huh?

01:13:19.130 --> 01:13:22.399
All right, well,
I'm gonna keep looking.

01:13:43.553 --> 01:13:46.188
That's my daughter
all right.

01:13:46.190 --> 01:13:49.359
The only girl I know who
runs away to go to school.

01:13:50.527 --> 01:13:52.161
It's our fault.

01:13:52.163 --> 01:13:54.662
Bet Dumbo wishes
he never met us.

01:13:54.664 --> 01:13:57.199
Ah, you showed him
he could fly.

01:13:57.201 --> 01:14:00.035
You think
he'd ever trade that?

01:14:00.037 --> 01:14:02.039
He would to have
his mom back.

01:14:07.677 --> 01:14:08.979
I miss Momma.

01:14:10.881 --> 01:14:12.616
Yeah, so do I.

01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:19.687
There's something
I want to show you.

01:14:19.689 --> 01:14:20.922
<i>With advances in both</i>

01:14:20.924 --> 01:14:22.824
<i>engineering and medicine...</i>

01:14:22.826 --> 01:14:25.227
<i>the human and the mechanical
will soon be combined...</i>

01:14:25.229 --> 01:14:28.696
<i>to assist ordinary families,
workers and veterans.</i>

01:14:28.698 --> 01:14:30.832
<i>All kinds
of technological marvels</i>

01:14:30.834 --> 01:14:32.903
<i>await us in the 20th century.</i>

01:14:34.170 --> 01:14:36.506
You're gonna do
great things.

01:14:37.741 --> 01:14:38.742
I know it.

01:14:49.619 --> 01:14:51.019
Whoa, whoa. What's this?

01:14:51.021 --> 01:14:52.654
Oh, give me a break.

01:14:52.656 --> 01:14:55.525
I gotta teach you
how to read English, too?

01:15:00.697 --> 01:15:03.698
Oh, Max, hello!

01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:05.767
Good, you brought
the paperwork.

01:15:05.769 --> 01:15:07.735
Max...

01:15:07.737 --> 01:15:10.538
I was reviewing
your troupe...

01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:12.240
and to be honest with you...

01:15:12.242 --> 01:15:14.909
they're really pale imitations
from the acts we already have.

01:15:14.911 --> 01:15:16.778
So I was thinking,
I don't know,

01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:18.579
a month's severance?
Seems fair.

01:15:18.581 --> 01:15:19.883
<i>Capisce?</i>

01:15:21.251 --> 01:15:23.151
I thought you promised to...

01:15:23.153 --> 01:15:26.054
Max, the contract says
that I'd hire them.

01:15:26.056 --> 01:15:28.089
It never stipulated
for how long.

01:15:28.091 --> 01:15:31.192
So, get your little band of
low-rent freaks out of here.

01:15:31.194 --> 01:15:34.762
But they're my troupe.
They're countin' on me.

01:15:34.764 --> 01:15:37.231
Okay, let's have a heart.

01:15:37.233 --> 01:15:39.102
Why don't you tell them?

01:15:50.814 --> 01:15:54.084
'Bout time, boss.
So, when do we start?

01:16:05.161 --> 01:16:06.860
What's going on, guys?

01:16:06.862 --> 01:16:08.829
Vandevere's fired them all.

01:16:08.831 --> 01:16:10.967
They're to leave by tomorrow.

01:16:23.712 --> 01:16:26.680
Goodbye, little friend.

01:16:26.682 --> 01:16:28.151
Goodbye.

01:16:30.353 --> 01:16:33.221
We wanted to see him
one last time.

01:16:33.223 --> 01:16:36.890
One last time
to see him fly.

01:16:36.892 --> 01:16:39.227
I don't think
he wants to anymore.

01:16:39.229 --> 01:16:41.161
Oh, no. But he must.

01:16:41.163 --> 01:16:43.930
He cannot lose
Mrs. Jumbo again!

01:16:43.932 --> 01:16:46.769
Uh, I'm afraid
it's rather worse than that.

01:16:47.303 --> 01:16:49.036
Mr. Sotheby?

01:16:49.038 --> 01:16:51.972
I've come
to clear my conscience.

01:16:51.974 --> 01:16:54.775
I resigned my position as soon
as I heard him give the order.

01:16:54.777 --> 01:16:57.144
What order?

01:16:57.146 --> 01:17:00.213
Mrs. Jumbo will be gone
by tomorrow night.

01:17:00.215 --> 01:17:02.051
And she's not
meant to survive.

01:17:17.866 --> 01:17:20.400
This "Dreamland"
doesn't deserve him.

01:17:20.402 --> 01:17:22.237
No circus does.

01:17:34.216 --> 01:17:38.653
Well, who's gonna be
willing to help me?

01:17:40.956 --> 01:17:42.791
Set Dumbo
and his momma free.

01:18:12.121 --> 01:18:13.686
<i>Welcome to the Colosseum,</i>

01:18:13.688 --> 01:18:16.391
<i>where the impossible
is possible.</i>

01:18:18.759 --> 01:18:21.428
Okay.
Second time's the charm.

01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:24.997
Let's see if Dream Daddy's
worked out the kinks.

01:18:24.999 --> 01:18:26.366
<i>Here to pick up the elephant</i>

01:18:26.368 --> 01:18:28.168
- <i>from Nightmare Island?</i>
- Confirmed.

01:18:28.170 --> 01:18:29.804
Unlock the back gates.

01:18:52.860 --> 01:18:55.428
Dumbo in position!

01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:57.263
Soon as he flies,
you run back to his tent

01:18:57.265 --> 01:18:58.864
and I'll find you there.

01:18:58.866 --> 01:19:00.199
All right, Big D.

01:19:01.503 --> 01:19:04.336
It's all up to you now.

01:19:04.338 --> 01:19:06.772
Come on, Holt!

01:19:16.751 --> 01:19:18.119
To hell with it.

01:19:22.823 --> 01:19:24.890
Ready for positions.

01:19:24.892 --> 01:19:27.159
We could have used
a little rehearsal.

01:19:27.161 --> 01:19:28.827
Rehearsal?

01:19:28.829 --> 01:19:31.132
Think we got a rehearsal
at the Battle of the Argonne?

01:19:32.166 --> 01:19:34.066
You sure you can do this?

01:19:34.068 --> 01:19:35.903
I fly elephants
all the time.

01:19:37.038 --> 01:19:39.538
Are you sure
you can do this?

01:19:39.540 --> 01:19:41.409
With one hand
tied behind my back.

01:19:54.222 --> 01:19:56.824
Wait. What's that?

01:19:58.192 --> 01:19:59.193
Ma'am?

01:20:00.995 --> 01:20:02.995
Ma'am?

01:20:02.997 --> 01:20:05.064
Sorry, ma'am,
attraction's closed.

01:20:05.066 --> 01:20:08.300
My dream...
to be a mermaid...

01:20:08.302 --> 01:20:10.835
and now
they've taken it away.

01:20:10.837 --> 01:20:13.305
And yet I hear
the water singing.

01:20:13.307 --> 01:20:14.540
I hear them
beckoning me home.

01:20:14.542 --> 01:20:16.475
Lady, just be careful,
okay?

01:20:16.477 --> 01:20:17.875
Return me
to the vast abyss!

01:20:17.877 --> 01:20:19.311
Let's go.

01:20:19.313 --> 01:20:21.748
- My destiny, the sea!
- Okay.

01:21:11.131 --> 01:21:12.398
We've lost power!

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:13.931
Even the cages?

01:21:13.933 --> 01:21:17.135
But the animals...

01:21:17.137 --> 01:21:19.471
Find the breakers.
Get the lights back on!

01:21:19.473 --> 01:21:21.308
And make sure
those cages are locked.

01:21:39.926 --> 01:21:41.326
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:21:41.328 --> 01:21:43.328
<i>boys and girls.</i>

01:21:43.330 --> 01:21:46.998
<i>Making his second
Dreamland debut.</i>

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.668
<i>Let's get ready for Dumbo!</i>

01:22:49.696 --> 01:22:50.696
Hey!

01:22:59.204 --> 01:23:00.939
It's a trick!
Get back to the...

01:23:16.255 --> 01:23:20.758
<i>And once again, our very own
Queen of the Heavens!</i>

01:23:42.649 --> 01:23:43.714
You.

01:23:43.716 --> 01:23:46.552
Where is
your circus of freaks?

01:23:48.420 --> 01:23:49.787
What's going on?

01:23:49.789 --> 01:23:52.289
The elephant's
mother is gone!

01:23:52.291 --> 01:23:55.225
His troupe's behind it!

01:23:55.227 --> 01:23:57.762
Alert the tower
and secure the gates.

01:23:57.764 --> 01:23:59.364
Don't let them get out.

01:24:00.632 --> 01:24:02.735
But why would they
only take the one?

01:24:04.236 --> 01:24:07.270
Keep your eye on Farrier
and those kids.

01:24:07.272 --> 01:24:08.974
You! Come with us.

01:24:23.155 --> 01:24:24.456
There they are!

01:24:26.492 --> 01:24:27.559
Hey!

01:24:37.503 --> 01:24:39.135
Hey, you!

01:24:39.137 --> 01:24:40.604
What are you
doing up there?

01:24:40.606 --> 01:24:42.405
That's private property.

01:24:42.407 --> 01:24:44.307
Come on! Get down here!

01:24:44.309 --> 01:24:45.542
Now!

01:24:45.544 --> 01:24:48.745
Hey, I'm Max Medici,
Vandevere's partner.

01:24:48.747 --> 01:24:51.314
He's just a maintenance man
fixing a light!

01:24:51.316 --> 01:24:52.616
Get back to your posts!

01:24:52.618 --> 01:24:54.486
Yes, sir, Mr. Medici.

01:25:09.468 --> 01:25:11.468
Let's try this again.

01:25:11.470 --> 01:25:12.771
You and me.

01:25:28.453 --> 01:25:29.719
Hey, the kids?

01:25:29.721 --> 01:25:30.887
Where are the kids?

01:25:30.889 --> 01:25:32.321
Hey, have you
seen the kids?

01:25:32.323 --> 01:25:36.425
Dumbo,
Prince of the Elephants!

01:25:36.427 --> 01:25:39.430
I command you
to fly with me.

01:25:54.545 --> 01:25:56.782
Dumbo, please fly.

01:25:57.849 --> 01:25:59.550
Do it for your momma.

01:26:54.639 --> 01:26:55.740
Where's your father?

01:27:09.253 --> 01:27:10.788
Dumbo!

01:27:23.367 --> 01:27:25.168
Hey! Get those kids!

01:27:28.304 --> 01:27:29.907
Dumbo!

01:28:02.405 --> 01:28:03.540
Come on.

01:28:04.709 --> 01:28:05.841
There!

01:28:23.426 --> 01:28:24.494
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

01:28:26.796 --> 01:28:28.331
Just passing through!

01:28:29.666 --> 01:28:31.301
Hey! You can't do that!

01:28:34.604 --> 01:28:35.737
Get the elephant!

01:28:35.739 --> 01:28:37.538
You get the elephant!

01:28:58.828 --> 01:29:01.996
Don't worry.
Dad'll be here soon.

01:29:01.998 --> 01:29:03.798
Where's the elephant?

01:29:09.939 --> 01:29:11.706
Why are you
just standing there?

01:29:11.708 --> 01:29:13.007
Get to the tower!

01:29:13.009 --> 01:29:15.343
Electricity's failing!
There's no elevators!

01:29:15.345 --> 01:29:18.980
When I last checked,
they invented stairs.

01:29:18.982 --> 01:29:20.681
<i>We seem to be experiencing</i>

01:29:20.683 --> 01:29:22.619
<i>some technical difficulties.</i>

01:29:37.066 --> 01:29:39.634
What happened to my power?

01:29:39.636 --> 01:29:42.470
What power, <i>mon cheri?</i>

01:29:42.472 --> 01:29:43.971
You ungrateful...

01:29:43.973 --> 01:29:47.842
You were nothing before
I made you my... Uh...

01:29:47.844 --> 01:29:50.880
I believe the word
is "queen."

01:29:52.381 --> 01:29:53.783
I need lights!

01:29:56.786 --> 01:29:58.619
Mr. Vandevere, wait!

01:29:58.621 --> 01:30:00.554
We have to reset the mains,
or you could cause a surge!

01:30:00.556 --> 01:30:01.756
Right now it's impossible!

01:30:01.758 --> 01:30:04.060
Nothing's impossible!

01:30:05.695 --> 01:30:07.563
Mr. Vandevere!

01:30:13.468 --> 01:30:14.838
Mr. Vandevere, stop!

01:30:40.596 --> 01:30:42.131
Milly! Joe!

01:30:50.939 --> 01:30:52.774
Come on. Go!
Come on!

01:31:19.468 --> 01:31:20.901
Get everyone out!

01:31:20.903 --> 01:31:22.938
Evacuate the park!

01:31:26.975 --> 01:31:28.708
Milly! Joe!

01:31:41.857 --> 01:31:43.025
Hey!

01:31:48.997 --> 01:31:51.031
Where is the elephant?

01:31:51.033 --> 01:31:53.033
Let her go!

01:32:09.818 --> 01:32:10.984
Come on!

01:32:10.986 --> 01:32:12.218
Milly! Joe!

01:32:12.220 --> 01:32:13.987
Dad!

01:32:13.989 --> 01:32:15.255
- You all right? All right?
- We're fine.

01:32:15.257 --> 01:32:16.957
Okay, come on.
All right, cover your faces.

01:32:16.959 --> 01:32:18.692
Give me your hand!
Come on!

01:32:18.694 --> 01:32:19.828
Back!

01:32:22.130 --> 01:32:23.231
Stay close.

01:32:32.707 --> 01:32:34.007
Come on, everybody.

01:32:34.009 --> 01:32:36.709
Let's get to the seaport!
Now!

01:32:36.711 --> 01:32:38.831
- Where are the Farriers?
- They must still be inside.

01:33:11.645 --> 01:33:12.645
Dad!

01:33:13.248 --> 01:33:14.713
It's okay, Joe.

01:33:16.218 --> 01:33:17.285
Come here. Come here.

01:33:20.222 --> 01:33:21.222
Dumbo!

01:33:29.264 --> 01:33:30.330
Dumbo!

01:33:30.332 --> 01:33:32.298
Come on!

01:33:32.300 --> 01:33:35.167
- Go! Go! Go! Go!
- Jump!

01:33:35.169 --> 01:33:36.735
Come on. Come on.

01:33:44.311 --> 01:33:46.113
- All right, let's go.
- Stay close, come on.

01:33:49.083 --> 01:33:50.349
Okay. Go! Go! Go!

01:33:50.351 --> 01:33:52.751
Come on!

01:33:52.753 --> 01:33:54.920
- Dumbo!
- Come on!

01:33:54.922 --> 01:33:56.321
Dumbo! What's wrong?

01:33:56.323 --> 01:33:58.157
Guys! Milly! Joe!
Come on!

01:33:58.159 --> 01:33:59.794
Dumbo, let's go!

01:34:03.798 --> 01:34:04.897
Go!

01:34:10.004 --> 01:34:11.637
Dumbo!

01:34:11.639 --> 01:34:13.272
Get him!

01:34:13.274 --> 01:34:15.808
He's seen us.
Dumbo, you gotta go.

01:34:15.810 --> 01:34:17.242
They're comin' for you.
You gotta go, Dumbo.

01:34:17.244 --> 01:34:18.343
He lost the feather.

01:34:18.345 --> 01:34:19.812
Feather doesn't do nothin'.

01:34:19.814 --> 01:34:21.780
Dumbo, you don't need
the feather to fly.

01:34:21.782 --> 01:34:23.348
Dad, they're coming!

01:34:23.350 --> 01:34:25.717
Stand back! Stand back!

01:34:25.719 --> 01:34:26.754
Out of my way!

01:34:28.989 --> 01:34:31.056
Dumbo, remember this?

01:34:31.058 --> 01:34:33.058
From my momma?

01:34:33.060 --> 01:34:37.930
I can unlock any door.
And you can, too.

01:34:37.932 --> 01:34:39.697
But I don't need
this key to do it.

01:34:39.699 --> 01:34:40.935
And you don't need
the feather.

01:34:42.136 --> 01:34:43.137
Come on.

01:34:58.419 --> 01:34:59.684
Dad!

01:34:59.686 --> 01:35:00.787
Gotta go. Come on!

01:35:02.722 --> 01:35:04.123
What are you doing?

01:35:04.125 --> 01:35:05.857
There ain't room
for the three of us.

01:35:05.859 --> 01:35:07.226
You get him to the seaport
and I'll see you there.

01:35:07.228 --> 01:35:08.628
Go on, Big D.

01:35:14.901 --> 01:35:16.101
Grab 'em!

01:35:16.103 --> 01:35:17.103
Hey!

01:35:23.244 --> 01:35:25.246
Hey!

01:35:26.913 --> 01:35:28.948
That's my elephant!

01:35:42.729 --> 01:35:44.295
They're safe.

01:35:44.297 --> 01:35:45.899
Come on, let's go!

01:35:48.768 --> 01:35:50.268
Hey! Get back here!

01:35:53.507 --> 01:35:55.306
You freak!
What have you done?

01:35:55.308 --> 01:35:57.141
What they pay me for,
mister.

01:35:57.143 --> 01:35:58.743
Put on a hell of a show.

01:36:01.981 --> 01:36:03.848
Hey! Him!

01:36:03.850 --> 01:36:05.750
Right there, arrest that man.
He stole my elephant.

01:36:05.752 --> 01:36:08.085
Hey, we had a contract,
Medici!

01:36:08.087 --> 01:36:11.124
I'm no expert, but I think
you got bigger problems here.

01:36:23.036 --> 01:36:25.138
Wow. This is a disaster.

01:36:26.306 --> 01:36:27.939
Come on,
I'll buy you a hot dog.

01:36:27.941 --> 01:36:29.874
Sounds good, J.G.

01:37:09.449 --> 01:37:11.982
Last call for cargo!

01:37:11.984 --> 01:37:14.585
All aboard!

01:37:35.841 --> 01:37:37.109
Colette!

01:37:45.183 --> 01:37:46.883
Where's your father?

01:37:46.885 --> 01:37:49.052
Don't worry.
He'll be here.

01:37:55.227 --> 01:37:56.594
Dad!

01:37:56.596 --> 01:37:58.464
I knew you could ride.

01:38:04.870 --> 01:38:06.972
- Pramesh, we have to go.
- Please, hurry.

01:38:08.273 --> 01:38:10.809
Hurry! Come on! Hurry!

01:38:11.910 --> 01:38:13.045
Come.

Let's go home.

01:38:31.330 --> 01:38:33.365
Hey!

01:38:55.253 --> 01:38:57.289
Well, get out of here,
you little troublemaker.

01:39:00.025 --> 01:39:01.057
Go on.
