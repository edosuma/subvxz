dinner with Mel b, it starts off
well and goes nowhere.

- The lid comes off.
- don't mess with Mel

01:19.156 --> 01:24.762
and don't mess with me either.

01:34.171 --> 01:37.107
There's so many good
singers.

01:37.107 --> 01:41.745
- It's so nervewracking.
- It's something you

01:41.745 --> 01:46.216

- I thought you were a

01:46.216 --> 01:50.454

01:55.159 --> 01:59.897
>> You said I was a little off,
though.

01:59.897 --> 02:00.000
Maybe she was a little
off.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.766
Maybe she was a little
off.

02:02.766 --> 02:10.474
What are you doing?
You've been really obnoxious

02:30.000 --> 02:31.662
- Going on over here.
- It's Simon.

02:31.662 --> 02:34.832
You're kind of like an
alien from another planet.

02:34.832 --> 02:39.003
What you can do with your balls
is unbelievable.

02:39.003 --> 02:42.439
I think you're fantastic.
I love you.

02:42.439 --> 02:48.512
I hate jugglers.
But now you've changed my mind.

02:48.512 --> 02:52.216
>> Amber didn't think we should
do this one.

02:52.216 --> 02:57.421
She was a little scared.

Maybe they had an
argument.

03:30.000 --> 03:36.393
Maybe they had an
argument.

03:36.393 --> 03:40.230
>> You're always a little bit
nervous, you just hope

03:40.230 --> 03:47.304
everything goes all right.
>> Pick one jelly bean.

03:47.304 --> 03:51.675

04:18.268 --> 04:29.346
figure this one out.

Again.
What an entrance?

04:42.192 --> 04:56.373
- Wowza.

05:19.129 --> 05:22.065
great artist, calysta.
You're a very special person.

05:22.065 --> 05:26.737
You really, truly are an
inspiration.

05:26.737 --> 05:30.000
Wow!

The best time of my life.

05:36.947 --> 05:39.249
>> This guy's got his hands all
over me.

05:39.249 --> 05:52.796
- Take me to dinner first.
- Come on!

05:52.796 --> 05:59.069
You're my golden boy.
You looked super handsome

05:59.069 --> 06:00.000
tonight.
>> Thank you.

06:00.000 --> 06:00.237
Tonight.
>> Thank you.

06:00.237 --> 06:18.388
Are you crying?

06:18.388 --> 06:20.858
- >> Whoa!
- Talk about putting your

06:20.858 --> 06:23.393
life on the line.
And I loved it.

06:23.393 --> 06:25.629
I don't think that is
enough to get you into the sell

06:25.629 --> 06:30.000
- my finals.
- You're making me cry.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.404
- My finals.
- You're making me cry.

06:34.404 --> 06:41.478
Your job is to mix it
up.

06:41.478 --> 06:47.217
Look at that, that is
a perfect score.

06:47.217 --> 06:50.487
It pulls you back,
deservedly so, an incredible

06:50.487 --> 06:54.458
- piece of magic.
- That's amazing.

06:54.458 --> 06:57.160
>> I was already eliminated
once.

06:57.160 --> 07:00.000
I'm determined not to get
eliminated again.

07:00.000 --> 07:00.564
I'm determined not to get
eliminated again.

07:00.564 --> 07:13.543
- It is fantastic.
- It was magic.

07:13.543 --> 07:20.517
America, give it up for

07:20.517 --> 07:26.490
your "America's got talent"
acts.

07:26.490 --> 07:29.993
Who got everybody talking?
Who blew up online?

07:29.993 --> 07:30.000
We'll find out tonight.
We've got the judges, of course,

07:30.000 --> 07:34.131
we'll find out tonight.
We've got the judges, of course,

07:34.131 --> 07:39.670
make some noise for Howie
mandel.

07:48.278 --> 07:55.485
And Simon cowell.
Now, Mel b.

07:55.485 --> 07:58.322
Last night it seemed like you
were searching for perfection.

07:58.322 --> 08:00.000
- Can you call it tonight?
- You know what, any other

08:00.000 --> 08:02.659
- can you call it tonight?
- You know what, any other

08:02.659 --> 08:04.127
season I would definitely be
able to call it.

08:04.127 --> 08:08.532
But the talent is so good this
year, I have no idea.

08:08.532 --> 08:10.934
I don't know how America's going
to decide.

08:10.934 --> 08:12.402
I don't know how they're going
to vote.

08:12.402 --> 08:16.873
But well done to everyone, no
matter what happens.

08:16.873 --> 08:22.679
Well done indeed.
And I'm here with some popular

08:22.679 --> 08:25.782
people from last night.
So Ryan, you had a lively night

08:25.782 --> 08:28.719
last night.
>> It was a lively night, yeah.

08:28.719 --> 08:30.000
Now, first question,
are you okay?

08:30.000 --> 08:30.687
Now, first question,
are you okay?

08:30.687 --> 08:35.959
>> I'm okay.
We had a malfunction with the

08:35.959 --> 08:38.428
equipment.
But I got out lucky.

08:38.428 --> 08:40.063
You didn't move for a
very long time.

08:40.063 --> 08:43.266
What was going through your time
in that moment when the arrow

08:43.266 --> 08:46.536
struck you?
>> We weren't sure what had gone

08:46.536 --> 08:47.604
wrong.
It was really trying to figure

08:47.604 --> 08:49.840
out whether I was on fire or
whether I was okay.

08:49.840 --> 08:54.177
Once we figured out we were
okay, you know, we went through

08:54.177 --> 08:57.314
the footage to see exactly what
went wrong.

08:57.314 --> 08:59.950
Now, this is the bruise
that we have here.

08:59.950 --> 09:00.000
- >> It's burnt, it's scraped.
- Like a little hickey or

09:00.000 --> 09:06.289
- >> it's burnt, it's scraped.
- Like a little hickey or

09:06.289 --> 09:08.725
something like that.
>> Something like that.

09:08.725 --> 09:11.495
Amberlynn, what do you
believe happened?

09:11.495 --> 09:15.932
>> We reviewed the footage.
My target was on point.

09:15.932 --> 09:18.769
- Malfunction of the equipment.
- I have equipment

09:18.769 --> 09:23.040
malfunctions all the time, I
understand, I get it.

09:23.040 --> 09:26.243
Let's keep it going for them one
more time, they're safe, Ryan

09:26.243 --> 09:29.413
and amberlynn.
Hopefully that love they got

09:29.413 --> 09:30.000
last night got America voting.
All right.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.116
Last night got America voting.
All right.

09:33.116 --> 09:37.220
Your votes from last night will
put five acts straight through

09:37.220 --> 09:42.692
to the sell my finals tonight.
The acts that came in sixth,

09:42.692 --> 09:45.162
seventh, and eighth are all in
danger of going home.

09:45.162 --> 09:50.033
But you can vote to keep one of
them in the competition with the

09:50.033 --> 09:54.137
live save.
In no particular order.

09:54.137 --> 10:00.000
The three acts in danger are.
Kadie Lynn.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.711
The three acts in danger are.

save?

10:24.801 --> 10:30.000

You've got 30 minutes to get

10:30.000 --> 10:30.240
the vote is open right now.
You've got 30 minutes to get

10:30.240 --> 10:30.707
your vote in.

10:56.133 --> 10:58.969
Heidi, America is going to vote
again for these three.

10:58.969 --> 11:00.000
- What are your thoughts?
- To be honest, I can't

11:00.000 --> 11:04.808
- what are your thoughts?
- To be honest, I can't

11:04.808 --> 11:07.010
believe that the three of you
are in this position.

11:07.010 --> 11:09.246
You shouldn't be in this
position because I love all

11:09.246 --> 11:12.048
three acts.
Kadie Lynn, I think you're so

11:12.048 --> 11:18.088
special.
You are a rising star.

11:18.088 --> 11:20.223
I hope America is going to vote
for you.

11:20.223 --> 11:24.194
Sal, I love you so much, I hope
America is going to vote for

11:24.194 --> 11:26.830
you.
And throwings, you love you guys

11:26.830 --> 11:30.000
too, you gave it your all, you
all really deserve to stay

11:30.000 --> 11:33.670
too, you gave it your all, you
all really deserve to stay

11:33.670 --> 11:35.172
tonight.
I wish you good luck.

11:35.172 --> 11:36.173
Good luck to all of
you.

11:36.173 --> 11:38.842
After the break, your votes will
put two acts straight into the

12:09.317 --> 12:15.122
are in danger of going home but
you can save one of them, so

12:15.122 --> 12:19.593
please keep voting.
As you know, when the acts go

12:19.593 --> 12:22.145
home after performances they get
to chill in the dunking lounge.

12:22.145 --> 12:25.032
Home after performances they get
to chill in the dunking lounge.

12:25.032 --> 12:27.768
It can get crazy in there too.
Here's what happened after the

12:27.768 --> 12:46.587
show last night.
>> Simon called you a singing

12:46.587 --> 12:50.791
- pizza.
- You're like a singing

12:50.791 --> 12:52.145
- pizza.
- Because you're so

12:52.145 --> 12:54.995
- pizza.
- Because you're so

12:54.995 --> 12:57.498
cheesy.
>> This is definitely one of the

12:57.498 --> 13:05.906
most scary things I have ever
witnessed.

13:05.906 --> 13:08.709
That was actually quite
a sound.

13:08.709 --> 13:12.480
You are astonishing at what you
do.

13:12.480 --> 13:17.718
And you're really cute.
>> Very cute.

13:17.718 --> 13:22.145
>> See you next time in the
dunkin' lounge.

13:22.145 --> 13:23.457
>> See you next time in the
dunkin' lounge.

13:23.457 --> 13:29.530
Okay.

13:29.530 --> 13:31.499
So that was a rare moment when
the pressure was off for the

13:31.499 --> 13:37.405
acts.
But it's right back on again

13:37.405 --> 13:39.740
now.
We're about to find out which

13:39.740 --> 13:45.246
