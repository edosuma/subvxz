WEBVTT

01:02.855 --> 01:04.856
You. Give me that.

01:05.774 --> 01:07.817
What are you talking about?

01:07.943 --> 01:09.819
- Mrs. Miller?
- Your phone, young lady.

01:09.945 --> 01:12.530
I was just switching it to silent
in case someone called.

01:12.656 --> 01:14.490
No, you were cheating.

01:14.616 --> 01:16.284
- Please. Like I have to cheat.
- Lady?

01:16.410 --> 01:18.453
I said wait!

01:18.579 --> 01:20.079
Give it here.

01:20.205 --> 01:21.330
Sure.

01:26.003 --> 01:28.129
Love the blouse.

01:31.550 --> 01:33.634
I need to use the bunk room.

01:34.303 --> 01:36.053
The bathroom? Sure.

01:36.764 --> 01:37.805
In 19 minutes.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.015
Can't do it.

01:39.892 --> 01:42.143
You got a friend in the bathroom
with the answers?

01:46.774 --> 01:49.150
Fine. I'll get you an escort.

01:56.992 --> 01:59.619
Don't stink up
till I kill you.

02:01.455 --> 02:02.914
Don't stand up.

02:03.040 --> 02:04.624
Dx...

02:05.626 --> 02:06.667
Dt...

02:06.794 --> 02:09.128
Hey, he's really sick.

02:13.008 --> 02:14.175
Eyes on your work.

02:14.301 --> 02:15.635
Are you all right?

02:16.804 --> 02:17.845
What is going on?

02:17.971 --> 02:19.180
Get some help.

02:57.052 --> 02:58.886
The kid was just taking his
AP calculus exam,

02:59.012 --> 03:00.847
when all of a sudden,
he got nauseous and disoriented.

03:00.973 --> 03:02.807
That's the way
calculus presents.

03:02.933 --> 03:04.100
Severe bradycardia.

03:04.226 --> 03:05.977
Heart rate's down
to 48 and falling fast.

03:06.103 --> 03:08.771
- You know the kid?
- No, he just came in.

03:08.897 --> 03:12.984
- Mom real good looking?
- I didn't notice.

03:13.277 --> 03:15.111
Then it's a mystery.

03:15.237 --> 03:17.738
Not why he's sick,
but why you care so much.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.824
Gift shop's open.
Buy him a card.

03:19.950 --> 03:22.618
- He's not responding to atropine.
- Boys love fart jokes.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.579
Find one with
a good fart joke.

03:26.415 --> 03:28.666
He's a teenager.
It's drugs.

03:29.418 --> 03:32.461
Tell those ER geniuses
to give him charcoal and naloxone,

03:32.588 --> 03:33.796
and stop following me.

03:33.922 --> 03:37.341
His tox screen was negative.
He's still whacked out.

03:38.427 --> 03:41.888
You don't care about the kid.
You just find his illness intriguing.

03:42.014 --> 03:43.264
His CAT scan was clean.

03:43.390 --> 03:45.308
There's no sign of infection.
It's not diabetes.

03:45.434 --> 03:47.059
And you don't care
about him.

03:47.185 --> 03:49.896
If that's what you wanna hear,
not in the slightest.

03:50.022 --> 03:51.439
Me, neither.

03:53.191 --> 03:55.026
Means we'll be objective.

04:01.658 --> 04:02.867
Maybe it's shigellosis.

04:02.993 --> 04:04.869
Wouldn't account
for the bradycardia.

04:04.995 --> 04:05.953
Viral myocarditis?

04:06.079 --> 04:08.164
Wouldn't account
for the whacked out.

04:08.290 --> 04:11.334
So, what's the differential
for a negative tox screen?

04:11.460 --> 04:12.418
He was clean.

04:12.544 --> 04:13.836
Unless someone
screwed up the test.

04:13.962 --> 04:15.504
That never happens.

04:15.631 --> 04:18.007
Or he OD'd
on something we didn't test for.

04:18.133 --> 04:20.885
1,4-butanediol would
give you these symptoms.

04:21.219 --> 04:23.804
- That's a new one.
- Copy machine toner.

04:24.139 --> 04:28.559
Same punch as GHB.
A little pricier, way more dangerous.

04:29.019 --> 04:31.062
On the other hand,
it is legal.

04:31.188 --> 04:34.065
I want you to go to his house
and find his stash.

04:34.191 --> 04:36.442
I'll bet you know all
the good hiding spots.

04:36.568 --> 04:38.736
Actually, I never did drugs.

04:39.071 --> 04:42.114
Better go with him,
in case he gets high.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.283
How much atropine
is the kid getting?

04:44.409 --> 04:45.409
One ml.

04:45.535 --> 04:48.788
Make it two.
In case he needs his heart later on.

04:51.083 --> 04:53.918
Matt, did you take
any drugs this morning?

04:54.378 --> 04:55.962
Pencils down.

04:57.673 --> 04:59.757
Can you squeeze
my fingers for me?

05:03.845 --> 05:07.348
Did anyone give you anything
to help with the math test?

05:08.141 --> 05:09.183
Matt?

05:09.309 --> 05:11.102
I told you.
He doesn't take drugs.

05:12.020 --> 05:15.690
Ms. Davis, all parents
think that about their children,

05:15.816 --> 05:17.817
and they're
usually wrong.

05:17.985 --> 05:20.945
I gave my mum a little trouble
when I was his age.

05:21.071 --> 05:23.280
I turned out okay.
Even she thought so.

05:23.407 --> 05:24.991
I know my kid.

05:25.117 --> 05:28.244
The fact that you did drugs
doesn't mean he did.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.998
Did he go anywhere last night?

05:34.042 --> 05:36.377
No, he was home studying.

05:36.503 --> 05:39.422
- Any friends come over to help him?
- And bring him drugs?

05:39.548 --> 05:41.382
- Is that what your friends did?
- Ms. Davis...

05:41.508 --> 05:42.466
Look,

05:44.761 --> 05:46.178
I tested him myself.

05:46.304 --> 05:48.889
The home kit.
I took some hair off his brush.

05:49.016 --> 05:52.226
I didn't want him to know about it,
because I do trust him.

05:53.103 --> 05:55.187
Then why did you test him?

05:57.232 --> 05:59.150
All he did
last night was study

05:59.276 --> 06:01.861
and argue about his
college interviews.

06:02.154 --> 06:06.866
He wants to be himself.
No haircut, ratty old clothes.

06:06.992 --> 06:08.868
That'll go over big.

06:08.994 --> 06:11.537
Then we both gave up and went to bed.
That's it.

06:11.663 --> 06:16.125
Has he ever had any problems
like this before? Any family history?

06:16.251 --> 06:18.669
No, it's just
me and Matt.

06:18.795 --> 06:20.796
- Diazepam, 10 milligrams, stat.
- Right.

06:20.922 --> 06:23.924
What's going on?
Just taking some precautions.

06:24.676 --> 06:27.803
He's seizing.
Help me hold him.

06:29.598 --> 06:32.224
Stay cool, mate.
We'll calm you down.

06:42.861 --> 06:45.237
This room is way too clean
for a teenage boy.

06:45.363 --> 06:47.031
You know why House
thinks I'm a druggie?

06:47.157 --> 06:48.783
This is gonna be
a racial thing, isn't it?

06:48.909 --> 06:51.202
Same reason he thinks
this kid overdosed.

06:51.328 --> 06:54.455
When you're a drug addict,
you wanna believe everyone else is, too.

06:54.581 --> 06:56.791
He's not addicted.
He has to take drugs.

06:56.917 --> 06:59.293
The definition of an addict.

06:59.961 --> 07:00.961
He's in pain.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.838
And addicted
to pain killers.

07:02.964 --> 07:04.632
What a coincidence!

07:07.052 --> 07:09.011
You really
never did any drugs?

07:10.055 --> 07:12.431
Now this is gonna
be a racial thing.

07:13.391 --> 07:14.892
Deflecting a personal
question with a joke.

07:15.018 --> 07:16.852
Gee, who do I know
that does that?

07:16.978 --> 07:18.896
Yeah, I'm just like him.

07:19.022 --> 07:21.899
Except for the angry, bitter,
pompous cripple part.

07:22.025 --> 07:24.193
Maybe we should all pitch in
and get you a nice cane.

07:24.319 --> 07:26.862
You already have
the matching gym shoes.

07:36.498 --> 07:37.414
Check this out!

07:39.835 --> 07:43.170
Mom's not too careful
with the homemade tomato sauce.

07:44.881 --> 07:45.923
When the top
sticks out like that,

07:46.049 --> 07:49.468
it's a sign of
bacterial contamination.

07:55.016 --> 07:56.517
This one's open.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.903
I am extremely disappointed.

08:10.574 --> 08:13.033
I send you out
for exciting new designer drugs,

08:13.160 --> 08:15.744
and you come back
with tomato sauce.

08:16.496 --> 08:19.748
I bet you paid twice as much.
I got mine online.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.836
Matt decided to make himself
a homemade pizza for a bedtime snack.

08:23.962 --> 08:26.547
Source of botulism,
as well as a million other toxins

08:26.673 --> 08:29.717
that cause gastroenteritis,
cardiac symptoms and mental confusion.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.510
I'm not so sure
about gastroenteritis.

08:31.636 --> 08:34.013
But mental confusion?
Bring it on.

08:34.139 --> 08:35.848
Don't, but...

08:35.974 --> 08:37.975
Delicious.

08:38.101 --> 08:39.476
Do you have a death wish?

08:39.603 --> 08:41.020
I notice
you didn't try to save me.

08:41.146 --> 08:43.063
I figured you were trying
to make some kind of subtle point.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.608
I was.
The kid just started seizing.

08:45.734 --> 08:47.693
Not a symptom of
food borne toxins.

08:48.278 --> 08:49.904
Also not
a symptom of drug use,

08:50.030 --> 08:52.114
not two hours
after admission.

08:52.240 --> 08:54.116
So, what would make him seize,

08:54.242 --> 08:56.493
in addition to all these
other delightful symptoms?

08:56.620 --> 08:59.079
- Pesticide poisoning.
- Carbamates.

08:59.206 --> 09:04.001
- Or organophosphates, organochlorines.
- Inhalation or absorption?

09:04.127 --> 09:05.294
Too soon to tell.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.963
We should wash him down.
The poison could still be on his skin.

09:08.423 --> 09:09.757
Already told the nurses.

09:24.189 --> 09:26.565
Nursing supervisor
to the instrument room.

09:26.691 --> 09:28.567
I feel good.

09:30.028 --> 09:31.987
That's your complaint?

09:32.739 --> 09:33.906
Your major symptom.

09:34.032 --> 09:35.574
I told her this
was a waste of time.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.368
I notice colors more.

09:38.078 --> 09:42.373
And music!
I'm really hearing music.

09:43.041 --> 09:45.918
I'm 82,
and I'm supposed to be

09:46.044 --> 09:48.504
playing canasta with
the other old ladies,

09:48.630 --> 09:53.509
but now, when I see
a guy with a cute butt,

09:54.719 --> 10:00.724
I can't stop looking at him.
Or a sexy beard.

10:01.559 --> 10:05.980
And you figure that enjoying cute butts
is a sign of disease?

10:06.106 --> 10:08.482
It all started
a month ago when Mark

10:08.608 --> 10:10.651
rented Gone with the Wind
for me,

10:10.777 --> 10:12.444
but it had
the wrong DVD in it.

10:12.988 --> 10:15.114
Right, I forgot.
This is all my fault.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.491
Of course, he was too
busy to bring it back.

10:17.617 --> 10:18.909
Yeah, like I don't
have a life.

10:19.035 --> 10:22.413
So I watched it,
and it had this actor in it,

10:22.831 --> 10:25.666
this kid called Ashton Kutcher.

10:26.126 --> 10:32.131
Now, I think about Ashton
all the time.

10:34.301 --> 10:36.343
All the time.

10:37.178 --> 10:38.304
Ah.

10:38.972 --> 10:43.392
You remind me of him.
Same bedroom eyes.

10:44.102 --> 10:46.186
People are
always mixing us up.

10:46.313 --> 10:49.273
I suppose you,
you need to check my heart?

10:49.399 --> 10:52.818
No. No, no, that...
That won't be necessary.

10:52.944 --> 10:53.902
I told you.

10:54.029 --> 10:56.196
But I am going to admit you
to the hospital for tests.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.198
What tests?
She's just old.

10:58.325 --> 11:00.159
And you're just insufferable.

11:00.285 --> 11:02.036
Your mother has had
a sudden personality change.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.037
She should be checked out.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.247
I'll have a nurse
come in and admit her.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.124
I'm too handsome
to do paperwork.

11:13.298 --> 11:15.632
Anesthesiologist to OR Room 4.

11:16.343 --> 11:19.219
Anesthesiologist
to OR Room 4.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.934
He's been on this medication for
over an hour.

11:26.061 --> 11:27.519
Pralidoxime is
very effective.

11:27.645 --> 11:29.813
It just takes a little time
for it to kick in.

11:29.939 --> 11:32.274
And maybe you're wrong.
Maybe it's not a pesticide.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.651
The blood work was
pretty conclusive.

11:34.778 --> 11:36.362
It's an organophosphate.

11:41.284 --> 11:42.117
Oh, my God.

11:42.243 --> 11:45.454
Move back.
Ms. Davis, move back, please.

11:47.499 --> 11:49.792
We're at 30, bradycardic arrest.
Get me the pads.

11:52.170 --> 11:53.712
What are you doing?

11:53.838 --> 11:55.964
We're gonna beat
his heart for him.

11:56.883 --> 11:58.300
Set it at 60.

12:31.209 --> 12:33.419
I can't stand
this anymore.

12:33.545 --> 12:35.379
We'll keep him on the pads
for another hour.

12:35.505 --> 12:36.880
Then what?

12:37.966 --> 12:39.174
Let's see what happens.

12:41.261 --> 12:46.515
Well, that's not my philosophy,
especially when it comes to my son.

12:46.641 --> 12:49.935
And if something
bad might happen,

12:50.061 --> 12:51.645
I'd like to know
what our options are.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.649
The pralidoxime
isn't doing him any good.

12:55.775 --> 12:56.817
We're gonna have
to wire his heart.

12:56.943 --> 12:58.026
Maybe we're wrong
about the pesticides.

12:58.153 --> 12:59.778
I ran his plasma again, twice.

12:59.904 --> 13:02.114
Are there any stronger treatments
for the organophosphate poisoning?

13:02.824 --> 13:05.242
Damn it! You caught me.
We went with the weak stuff.

13:05.368 --> 13:06.535
I was just trying to
save a little money.

13:06.661 --> 13:08.203
Actually, one of my
professors at Columbia

13:08.329 --> 13:10.080
developed an experimental treatment
for the Army.

13:10.206 --> 13:11.999
- What's the success rate?
- They're targeted.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.126
There's a different hydrolase treatment
for each poison.

13:14.252 --> 13:16.879
We need to know if Matt got hit
with Orthene or malathion...

13:17.005 --> 13:17.963
What's the success rate?

13:18.089 --> 13:20.048
Excellent, I'm sure.
It's the US Army.

13:20.175 --> 13:21.842
"Be all you can be."

13:21.968 --> 13:24.052
Point is, what are the kid's
chances without it?

13:24.304 --> 13:26.847
Minimal at best. The poison's broken
the blood-brain barrier.

13:26.973 --> 13:29.766
I assume "minimal at best"
is your stiff-upper-lip,

13:29.893 --> 13:31.518
British way of saying
"no chance in hell".

13:31.644 --> 13:32.853
I'm Australian.

13:32.979 --> 13:34.980
You put the Queen on your money.
You're British.

13:35.106 --> 13:36.648
And call your professor.

13:36.774 --> 13:39.067
If we don't know what kind
of organophosphate we're targeting,

13:39.194 --> 13:40.986
we don't know which
hydrolase to ask for.

13:41.112 --> 13:42.154
There's over 40
organophosphates.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.740
- I'll get all of them.
- Get all of them.

13:45.450 --> 13:47.117
Great minds think alike.

13:47.243 --> 13:49.119
By the time they get here,
we're gonna know which one we need.

13:49.245 --> 13:50.829
Well, if we figure
out how he got exposed,

13:50.955 --> 13:52.247
we'll figure out
what he was exposed to.

13:52.373 --> 13:54.082
Well, the mom had
homemade tomato sauce.

13:54.209 --> 13:57.836
Call me crazy, but I'm thinking
maybe homemade tomatoes.

13:57.962 --> 13:59.213
- Front yard, vegetable garden.
- Yeah.

13:59.339 --> 14:02.090
Kid's out there spraying,
sees a pretty girl,

14:02.217 --> 14:05.052
hormones raging,
spray can goes off in his face.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.680
- I'll check into it.
- I'll make the call.

14:08.806 --> 14:11.725
I'll keep the kid alive,
for a while, at least.

14:12.894 --> 14:14.811
I'll have lunch.

14:15.647 --> 14:20.567
Through the superior vena cava,
into the right atrium.

14:21.611 --> 14:23.862
Through the tricuspid valve

14:25.907 --> 14:29.243
and lodging into the wall
of the right ventricle.

14:31.955 --> 14:33.997
Can you turn off
the pads?

14:39.087 --> 14:41.088
Capturing?

14:41.214 --> 14:42.839
Getting a native
heart rate of 36.

14:42.966 --> 14:44.758
No, that won't do.
Let's get him to 50.

15:09.075 --> 15:12.619
"The healer with his magic powers,

15:13.079 --> 15:16.957
I could rub his
gentle brow for hours

15:17.834 --> 15:21.336
His manly chest,
his stubbled jaw

15:21.838 --> 15:25.132
Everything about him
leaves me raw"

15:25.258 --> 15:26.341
Psych ward's upstairs.

15:26.467 --> 15:27.634
"With joy

15:28.511 --> 15:33.265
Oh, House, your very name
will never leave this girl the same"

15:33.808 --> 15:36.101
It's not bad for
an 82-year-old.

15:36.227 --> 15:38.186
She asked me to give that
to her true love.

15:38.313 --> 15:41.189
What can I say?
Chicks with no teeth turn me on.

15:41.316 --> 15:44.192
- That's fairly disgusting.
- And that's ageism.

15:44.319 --> 15:46.528
You better watch yourself
around this babe.

15:46.654 --> 15:48.655
Here are
her test results.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.287
Impressive.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.709
- Yeah.
- I found the pesticide.

16:00.835 --> 16:02.544
It's disulfoton.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.379
And it's empty.
He used up the whole can.

16:04.505 --> 16:05.881
Okay, I'll get Chase on it.

16:06.924 --> 16:08.967
The poison's
called disulfoton.

16:09.093 --> 16:11.678
This should bond with it
and neutralize the poison.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.347
Then his nervous system
will start sending

16:13.473 --> 16:14.848
the correct signals
to the rest of his body.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.933
But there was no disul...

16:17.060 --> 16:18.143
Well, that stuff in that can.

16:18.269 --> 16:20.145
The label says "disulfoton".
I can show you.

16:20.271 --> 16:22.189
But you didn't test it.

16:22.357 --> 16:24.983
You said Matt sprayed with it
this morning before school.

16:25.109 --> 16:28.111
Matt started that garden himself
for an environmental science class.

16:28.237 --> 16:29.655
They weren't allowed
to use pesticides.

16:29.781 --> 16:30.906
Apparently,
he cheated a little.

16:31.032 --> 16:33.992
It was orange-peel oil,
totally organic.

16:34.118 --> 16:35.410
He dumped that other stuff
last winter.

16:35.536 --> 16:36.953
The symptoms fit.

16:37.080 --> 16:38.580
There must have been
some left in the can.

16:38.706 --> 16:42.042
If you're wrong,
what will this treatment do to him?

16:42.210 --> 16:46.296
Well, theoretically,
it could increase the toxicity and...

16:47.048 --> 16:47.881
But we're not wrong.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.050
- Don't.
- We're not wrong.

16:50.176 --> 16:52.094
I can't let you do this.

16:56.349 --> 16:57.641
Get a court order.

16:57.767 --> 17:00.519
Unless you wanna see someone killed
by sheer irrationality.

17:00.645 --> 17:02.562
Maternal instinct
is always irrational.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.439
Doesn't mean
it's wrong.

17:04.565 --> 17:06.400
Actually,
that's the definition.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.443
It doesn't make her
mentally incompetent.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.404
She is risking
her son's life

17:10.530 --> 17:13.448
based on a teenager's claim
that he washed something.

17:13.574 --> 17:15.492
How mentally incompetent
can you get?

17:15.618 --> 17:17.869
That's a brilliant
legal argument.

17:19.997 --> 17:21.957
Listen, have your
Harvard law dog whip up

17:22.083 --> 17:25.085
some high-grade,
legal-sounding psychobabble.

17:25.211 --> 17:28.255
"Temporary insanity brought on
by acute panic distress syndrome."

17:28.381 --> 17:30.090
I don't care.
We have to give him the hydrolase.

17:30.216 --> 17:34.010
Her only sign of mental illness
is that she disagrees with you.

17:34.637 --> 17:36.638
Some would consider
that a sign of sanity.

17:36.764 --> 17:38.890
Not the kid.
Let's ask him.

17:39.016 --> 17:41.017
Oh, no, I forgot.
We can't. He's dying.

17:42.645 --> 17:46.148
Get the mother to sign off
that she's refusing this treatment.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.617
Good-bye.

18:00.121 --> 18:02.914
"I, Margo Davis,
have been informed of the risks

18:03.040 --> 18:05.834
which may arise
from my refusal of advised medical care.

18:05.960 --> 18:08.211
- I hereby release..."
- Who are you?

18:08.337 --> 18:09.546
I work for the hospital.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.800
"...the Princeton-Plainsboro
Teaching Hospital and its employees,

18:13.926 --> 18:16.303
agents and otherwise,
from any adverse medical conditions

18:16.429 --> 18:17.679
resulting from my refusal.

18:17.847 --> 18:21.141
It is not the hospital's fault
if my son kicks off."

18:21.267 --> 18:22.976
Kicks off?

18:23.102 --> 18:26.605
I punched up the language,
mostly for clarification.

18:27.482 --> 18:30.817
"I understand my doctors consider
my decision to be completely idiotic..."

18:30.943 --> 18:31.777
Why are you doing this?

18:31.903 --> 18:33.904
"...but I am convinced
I know more than they do.

18:34.155 --> 18:36.656
I took a biology
course in high school."

18:36.783 --> 18:38.700
I assume that's...
Yeah.

18:39.285 --> 18:43.997
"Besides, I enjoy controlling every
single aspect of my son's life,

18:44.123 --> 18:46.249
even if it means his death."

18:47.794 --> 18:51.046
Sign here, please.
I brought a pen.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.216
Who are you?

18:54.342 --> 18:56.802
I'm the doctor
who's trying to save your son.

18:56.928 --> 18:59.221
You're the mom
who's letting him die.

18:59.347 --> 19:02.098
Clarification,
it's a beautiful thing.

19:08.523 --> 19:10.982
Dr. Morell,
contact the CAP lab.

19:11.108 --> 19:12.776
Dr. Morell,
contact the CAP lab.

19:13.194 --> 19:15.862
She rethought her position.

19:15.988 --> 19:19.866
- Start him on the hydrolase.
- No. We've got a problem.

19:21.369 --> 19:23.245
Three. One, two, three.

19:25.456 --> 19:28.208
Heart rate's 49.
O2 stat, 84 and falling.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.502
Saline,
atropine and diazepam, now.

19:31.087 --> 19:34.005
His name is Chi Ling.
He was admitted 12 minutes ago.

19:34.131 --> 19:36.883
Identical symptoms as Matt.
Chase isn't sure he's gonna make it.

19:47.562 --> 19:48.812
This one.

19:49.772 --> 19:50.939
Bag.

20:05.538 --> 20:08.248
Matt's next-door neighbor,
by any chance?

20:08.791 --> 20:10.959
They live 10 miles apart.

20:11.294 --> 20:14.337
Apparently, they don't
even know each other.

20:36.027 --> 20:39.279
We live in an apartment.
We have two bamboo trees.

20:39.405 --> 20:43.199
No pesticides,
just dry seaweed for fertilizer.

20:43.910 --> 20:46.077
The second kid's heart
is almost as weak as Matt's.

20:46.203 --> 20:47.871
We may need to get
it wired up, too.

20:47.997 --> 20:49.623
And I don't know how long
Matt's brain will hold up.

20:49.749 --> 20:50.832
His heart's not
pumping enough oxygen.

20:50.958 --> 20:52.500
- How much are you giving him?
- Eighty percent.

20:52.627 --> 20:53.585
Make it 90.

20:53.711 --> 20:55.045
We're risking
damage to his retina.

20:55.171 --> 20:56.796
What the heck.
Do it anyway.

20:56.923 --> 20:57.964
He's a calculus student.

20:58.090 --> 21:00.175
Probably likes
having a brain.

21:00.301 --> 21:01.885
I'll have Foreman
take care of it.

21:02.720 --> 21:03.720
I'm the primary.

21:03.846 --> 21:05.972
Yeah, but the mom
wants to get rid of you.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.099
And you know me.
I'm a people-pleasing kind of guy.

21:08.225 --> 21:10.268
What, she complained?
About me?

21:10.394 --> 21:11.436
She went to the principal.

21:11.562 --> 21:13.939
Told Cuddy you took
drugs in high school.

21:14.065 --> 21:15.941
This is gonna go
on your permanent record.

21:16.067 --> 21:17.275
I was trying to
get information.

21:17.401 --> 21:18.568
It was a strategy.

21:18.694 --> 21:21.404
She also used the word "slacker".
You wanna come in?

21:21.530 --> 21:24.032
Smoke a little weed?
Watch some MTV?

21:26.911 --> 21:28.078
High school has no idea
what could have happened.

21:28.204 --> 21:31.039
You sure that Chi didn't sneak
onto Matt's tomato patch?

21:31.165 --> 21:33.625
Maybe they sniffed disulfoton
together to get high.

21:33.751 --> 21:36.252
Same school, different grades,
different cliques, different everything.

21:36.379 --> 21:37.796
They managed to get
poisoned together.

21:37.922 --> 21:39.047
They must have
something in common.

21:39.173 --> 21:40.799
Their classes aren't even
in the same building.

21:40.925 --> 21:43.551
They don't even eat lunch
in the same lunchroom.

21:44.178 --> 21:46.012
How do they get to school?

21:47.431 --> 21:50.058
Unless you're with the
board, the police or the union,

21:50.184 --> 21:51.768
I don't care who you are.

21:51.894 --> 21:53.979
Sir, we need to test the bus
for chemical residue.

21:54.105 --> 21:56.189
And I need to pick up
the basketball team.

21:56.315 --> 21:59.109
You got a problem with that,
call my supervisor.

21:59.652 --> 22:02.112
Two kids were poisoned
on your bus this morning.

22:02.238 --> 22:03.863
They're dying.

22:08.953 --> 22:11.621
My God.
The things he said.

22:12.999 --> 22:15.959
Dr. House wanted your son to get
the medicine he needed.

22:16.085 --> 22:18.003
He was willing to do whatever
it took to make that happen.

22:18.129 --> 22:22.132
- The wrong kind of medicine.
- He didn't know that.

22:22.258 --> 22:24.009
At the time,
it was our only choice.

22:24.135 --> 22:27.220
He would have known
if he had listened to me.

22:27.388 --> 22:31.558
He listened.
He just assumed you were wrong.

22:32.768 --> 22:34.853
To be honest,
that's true of most of our patients.

22:36.856 --> 22:39.941
You're just as pompous
and superior as he is.

22:42.945 --> 22:44.362
Matt is
back row, right.

22:44.488 --> 22:46.531
The Asian kid,
first or second row, left.

22:46.657 --> 22:48.158
- Okay.
- Look,

22:48.284 --> 22:51.161
I got this rash in
kind of my groin region.

22:51.579 --> 22:53.705
It's not a symptom.

22:53.998 --> 22:55.248
Neither is being obnoxious.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.834
Looks like
you're in the clear.

23:02.882 --> 23:04.007
So who poisoned them?

23:05.092 --> 23:06.843
We're not sure yet
if it was done on purpose.

23:06.969 --> 23:08.970
Oh, yeah? You ought to see
these little bastards,

23:09.096 --> 23:10.764
screaming and
punching each other all day long.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.390
Did you happen to notice
if anyone was doing any spraying

23:12.516 --> 23:14.893
near the bus route?

23:15.603 --> 23:17.562
Yeah, there was this truck
down by the pond

23:17.688 --> 23:18.980
doing something or other.

23:19.106 --> 23:20.899
It smelled kind of funny, too.

23:28.365 --> 23:29.908
Dr. House!

23:30.034 --> 23:32.494
Well, it took you long enough.
We've been waiting here...

23:32.620 --> 23:34.746
Mr. Adams, would you
step outside for a moment?

23:35.081 --> 23:37.957
- Why?
- Because you irritate me.

23:38.084 --> 23:40.960
He is my son, Doctor.

23:41.087 --> 23:44.130
He's just a little
cranky from not eating.

23:45.549 --> 23:49.677
Fine. Mrs. Adams, have you had
any recent sexual activity?

23:49.929 --> 23:50.929
What?

23:52.765 --> 23:56.101
Well, I don't
suppose fantasies count.

23:56.227 --> 23:57.644
Oh, my God.

23:57.770 --> 24:01.147
Unfortunately,
I've hit kind of a dry spell.

24:02.024 --> 24:05.693
Only for the last,
I don't know, 15 years.

24:05.820 --> 24:08.029
You see?
She's confused.

24:08.155 --> 24:10.406
My father died eight years ago.
Heart attack.

24:10.533 --> 24:12.242
Not in bed, dear.

24:16.247 --> 24:18.164
Why do you ask?

24:19.250 --> 24:22.502
Because you have tested
positive for syphilis.

24:22.628 --> 24:26.005
That's impossible!
And insulting.

24:27.716 --> 24:28.925
I don't think
it's the first time

24:29.051 --> 24:31.845
that Mom has
heard this diagnosis.

24:35.349 --> 24:37.809
Cupid's disease.

24:37.935 --> 24:39.269
That's what we
used to call it.

24:40.855 --> 24:42.313
When did you get it?

24:44.191 --> 24:49.362
1939, prom night, I think.
He had a Chevrolet.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.992
It was before
I met your father.

24:54.118 --> 24:55.201
But you said that...

24:57.121 --> 25:01.541
- You said Dad was your first love.
- He was.

25:03.419 --> 25:05.545
We're talking about sex.

25:08.465 --> 25:10.133
But I was treated.

25:10.259 --> 25:12.927
Which suppressed it,
in your case, for 60 years,

25:13.637 --> 25:16.806
but now it's back, and the spirochetes
that cause syphilis

25:16.932 --> 25:18.975
are eating away
at your brain cells.

25:19.101 --> 25:22.020
That's revolting.

25:22.146 --> 25:24.105
It's not as
revolting as chlamydia.

25:24.231 --> 25:25.565
That's got seepage.

25:26.066 --> 25:27.233
And it's the 21st century.

25:27.359 --> 25:30.862
We've got flying cars,
robot dogs and penicillin.

25:31.572 --> 25:33.448
High-dose regimen for two weeks,
you're cured.

25:33.574 --> 25:36.826
- I can't believe this.
- Yeah, well, pinch yourself.

25:36.952 --> 25:41.247
I guess for the next two weeks,
I'd better practice safe sex.

25:42.917 --> 25:47.003
You'll be fine.
Just feed that cranky kid.

25:53.260 --> 25:54.969
The county's
worried about West Nile,

25:55.095 --> 25:57.805
so they sprayed ethyl parathion
right next to the bus route.

25:58.307 --> 26:00.516
Do you have the hydrolase
for ethyl parathion?

26:00.643 --> 26:03.978
Yeah, only one problem. Matt's mother
faxed his records to the CDC.

26:04.104 --> 26:05.480
She refuses to
let us do anything

26:05.606 --> 26:07.815
until she hears
back from them.

26:07.942 --> 26:10.526
Well, you're getting good
at this godlike doctor racket.

26:10.653 --> 26:12.445
Why don't you talk
her out of this lunacy?

26:12.571 --> 26:14.239
She's not really
a big fan of mine.

26:14.365 --> 26:15.448
Or mine.

26:15.574 --> 26:19.661
Well, only one man left in the bull pen,
and he throws like a girl.

26:22.164 --> 26:24.123
I hate sports metaphors.

26:25.793 --> 26:27.627
Give her the high,
hard one.

26:28.128 --> 26:30.046
We really think
the hydrolase is the only...

26:30.172 --> 26:32.048
I'm thinking about transferring
Matt out of here.

26:32.174 --> 26:34.217
Ms. Davis,
your son is very sick.

26:34.343 --> 26:35.551
He won't survive
a transfer.

26:35.678 --> 26:38.596
I'm getting a second opinion
from the Center for Disease Control.

26:38.722 --> 26:42.392
Right. Look, when my
grandmother got sick...

26:42.518 --> 26:46.062
What? You're gonna tell me some
tough decision you had to make?

26:46.188 --> 26:47.146
I know how hard
this is for you.

26:47.273 --> 26:48.898
Maybe embroider
the story a little?

26:49.024 --> 26:50.525
Make it fit?

26:50.859 --> 26:52.527
I can't imagine
being in your position.

26:52.653 --> 26:55.029
Honesty, a kind of
vulnerable honesty.

26:55.155 --> 26:56.614
That's your thing.
And the looks.

26:56.740 --> 26:57.782
Oh, boy.

26:57.908 --> 27:00.702
They send a single woman
to hustle the single mom.

27:00.828 --> 27:03.079
Actually, they sent a doctor

27:03.205 --> 27:05.707
to tell you that if your son
doesn't get this treatment,

27:05.833 --> 27:07.875
there's a good chance
he'll die.

27:08.377 --> 27:12.046
That's what House said about a treatment
that would have killed Matt.

27:12.172 --> 27:13.298
You've gotta do
better than that.

27:13.424 --> 27:15.800
No, it's on you.

27:15.926 --> 27:18.511
You need to do better.
Right now. Yes or no?

27:21.682 --> 27:24.600
- I don't know.
- Figure it out.

27:25.936 --> 27:27.061
Wait.

28:21.492 --> 28:22.492
Nurse!

28:23.702 --> 28:25.536
- Help!
- Okay. Coming.

28:27.498 --> 28:28.873
Seizing. Suction.

28:28.999 --> 28:30.166
Watch his head.

28:31.251 --> 28:33.044
My son!

28:37.758 --> 28:38.925
Coming.

28:39.051 --> 28:40.093
Diazepam.

28:40.219 --> 28:41.260
Got it.

28:44.723 --> 28:46.474
Suction.
Ten milligrams.

28:46.600 --> 28:47.725
Right.

28:47.851 --> 28:50.186
He's not responding.
Another 10 milligrams.

28:50.312 --> 28:51.896
You're killing him!

28:52.773 --> 28:54.023
You're killing him!

28:54.149 --> 28:55.691
Get her out of here.
Get her out of here!

28:55.818 --> 28:57.902
Come on, ma'am.
Ma'am?

29:07.871 --> 29:10.248
Their hearts are barely
pumping. Their lungs are shot.

29:10.374 --> 29:12.291
Now they're
showing liver toxicity.

29:12.418 --> 29:14.127
I guess Matt's mom
won't nominate us

29:14.253 --> 29:16.003
for any
doctor-of-the-year awards.

29:16.130 --> 29:19.841
Only explanation is they got poisoned
by something besides ethyl parathion.

29:19.967 --> 29:21.551
Then the hydrolase would release
the neurotoxins

29:21.677 --> 29:22.677
instead of bonding with them.

29:22.803 --> 29:24.804
The only thing they have in common
is the bus.

29:24.930 --> 29:26.431
Except their symptoms.

29:26.557 --> 29:29.308
Given their severity and the fact their
cardiac symptoms are getting worse

29:29.435 --> 29:31.519
much faster than their other ones,
what does that tell us?

29:31.645 --> 29:33.521
The poison was probably absorbed
through the skin.

29:33.647 --> 29:35.940
They were admitted
at 8:45 and 11:00.

29:36.066 --> 29:36.816
When were they poisoned?

29:36.942 --> 29:39.819
Absorption through the skin,
anywhere from three to eight hours.

29:39.945 --> 29:41.779
In a case that bad,
more like one-and-a-half to four.

29:41.905 --> 29:46.576
So Matt was poisoned before 7:15.
Before he got on the bus.

29:47.035 --> 29:50.204
You're thinking each kid
got poisoned in his own house?

29:50.330 --> 29:51.497
Two separate exposures?

29:51.623 --> 29:54.959
What do teenage boys do in the morning,
besides the obvious?

29:55.294 --> 29:57.378
Wake up, go to the bathroom,

29:57.504 --> 30:00.673
then the obvious,
then check their zits in the mirror.

30:00.799 --> 30:02.884
Do they both use
the same acne cream?

30:03.010 --> 30:05.678
Because acne cream contains lanolin,
which could have pesticides,

30:05.804 --> 30:07.847
and you're thinking
they both bought the same product.

30:07.973 --> 30:09.807
It was contaminated.
Shaving cream.

30:09.933 --> 30:11.142
Chi doesn't look
like he shaves.

30:11.268 --> 30:12.226
But he sweats.

30:12.352 --> 30:13.394
Deodorant could
contain lanolin.

30:13.520 --> 30:14.896
Do these people
have animals?

30:15.022 --> 30:16.564
Chi has a dog.
Matt has a cat.

30:16.690 --> 30:19.484
- Fleas, flea powder.
- Okay. Go to their houses.

30:19.610 --> 30:20.902
Check for anything that
might have touched their skin

30:21.028 --> 30:23.529
between the time they got up
and the time they went to school.

30:23.655 --> 30:25.364
And I'm running
low on tomato sauce.

30:27.242 --> 30:28.659
Dr. House!

30:30.245 --> 30:31.496
Hello.

30:32.915 --> 30:36.292
- I sent you home.
- Well, I came back.

30:36.919 --> 30:38.836
I took a cab,

30:38.962 --> 30:42.840
so my son wouldn't try
to chaperone us this time.

30:42.966 --> 30:46.135
I'm sorry, but the fact that
the sexual-pleasure center

30:46.261 --> 30:49.180
of your cerebral cortex has been
over-stimulated by spirochetes,

30:49.306 --> 30:52.683
it's a poor basis
for a relationship.

30:52.809 --> 30:54.101
I learned that one
the hard way.

30:55.521 --> 30:59.649
Doctor, these feelings
that I've been having,

31:00.817 --> 31:03.653
is it all because
of the syphilis?

31:03.987 --> 31:05.029
Yes.

31:06.532 --> 31:07.823
Then

31:09.326 --> 31:11.869
here's the prescription
you gave me.

31:17.167 --> 31:20.753
Well, it's not likely
I'm going to infect anyone.

31:21.046 --> 31:23.965
No, but it'll kill you.

31:24.841 --> 31:27.927
Well, gotta go sometime,

31:29.388 --> 31:31.973
and I really don't
want to play canasta

31:32.099 --> 31:33.891
for the rest of my life.

31:34.560 --> 31:38.479
I like feeling sexy again,

31:39.940 --> 31:44.777
making a fool out of myself
with handsome, young doctors.

31:47.614 --> 31:50.700
Do you think that
I would have given you this

31:50.826 --> 31:53.160
if it would stop you
from flirting with me?

31:53.287 --> 31:54.620
Well, but if I'm cured...

31:54.746 --> 31:57.665
Then all the spirochetes
will die off.

31:57.791 --> 31:59.917
But the little pieces
of your cerebral cortex

32:00.043 --> 32:02.420
that have been
destroyed won't grow back.

32:04.214 --> 32:06.090
You're brain damaged.

32:07.801 --> 32:10.928
Doomed to feeling good
for the rest of your life.

32:13.056 --> 32:16.017
Really?
Well, thank you.

32:16.143 --> 32:17.435
Georgia.

32:21.982 --> 32:27.111
When I stop being contagious,
I'll come by for a checkup.

32:34.119 --> 32:34.952
Yeah.

32:38.749 --> 32:39.749
Matt uses Sure.

32:39.875 --> 32:41.208
Chi uses Old Spice.

32:41.335 --> 32:42.293
No zit cream.

32:42.419 --> 32:43.419
Lucky kid.

32:44.338 --> 32:45.463
Floral air freshener.

32:45.589 --> 32:46.631
Doesn't matter.

32:46.757 --> 32:48.215
When was the last time you heard
of a teenage boy

32:48.342 --> 32:51.093
using air freshener?

32:51.219 --> 32:54.972
- Pert shampoo.
- Johnson's over here.

32:55.932 --> 32:57.808
Matt's mom would make him
use air freshener.

32:57.934 --> 33:01.020
There are limits to a mother's power,
even hers.

33:01.647 --> 33:02.938
Just check.

33:05.150 --> 33:06.275
Negative on the floral.

33:06.401 --> 33:08.361
Matt's ALTs are
up to 800.

33:08.487 --> 33:10.029
If they get any higher,
we can toss his liver.

33:12.532 --> 33:13.991
- Yeah.
- No matches on flea powder

33:14.117 --> 33:15.242
or underarm deodorant.

33:15.369 --> 33:16.494
Or any other
kind of deodorant.

33:16.620 --> 33:17.703
What about shampoo?

33:17.829 --> 33:21.582
No to shampoo, bar soap,
dish soap, dish detergent.

33:21.708 --> 33:22.958
How about laundry detergent?

33:23.085 --> 33:24.752
Maybe they both washed
their clothes this morning.

33:24.878 --> 33:25.878
I'll check.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.004
You know,
if we cure Matt,

33:27.130 --> 33:30.049
he can use his close brush with death
on his college essays.

33:30.175 --> 33:31.759
Admission guys
love that stuff.

33:31.885 --> 33:35.137
That's how you got in, right?
Jailhouse diary?

33:38.725 --> 33:41.477
TKO.

33:43.188 --> 33:45.481
- Liquid?
- Liquid, 128 ounces.

33:45.607 --> 33:47.858
128, yellow jug.
"Special..."

33:47.984 --> 33:50.194
"Environmentally
safe formula."

33:50.362 --> 33:52.154
It's the same.
Bring in the detergent.

33:52.280 --> 33:54.573
So the detergent was contaminated
with pesticides?

33:54.700 --> 33:55.950
Which soaked
into their clothes

33:56.076 --> 33:58.619
and got absorbed
into their skin.

33:59.955 --> 34:03.290
Hi. Listen,
the clothes your son wore today,

34:03.417 --> 34:05.334
he washed them
this morning, right?

34:05.460 --> 34:06.460
What?

34:06.586 --> 34:09.046
Nice, respectful Asian
kid does the laundry.

34:11.675 --> 34:14.135
My wife said he didn't.

34:15.178 --> 34:18.139
Well, then I'm betting he washed them
last night without you knowing.

34:20.517 --> 34:22.852
He doesn't even know
how to turn on the machine.

34:22.978 --> 34:24.145
And those clothes
were new.

34:24.271 --> 34:26.731
- Nobody washed them.
- His clothes are all new?

34:26.982 --> 34:30.276
The ones he wore today, yes.
Never washed.

34:38.368 --> 34:40.035
Now what?

34:42.748 --> 34:45.624
What about Matt's clothes?
Were they new?

34:46.334 --> 34:48.669
They're ratty
old jeans, I think.

34:48.795 --> 34:51.547
They've been bagged
and taken downstairs.

35:01.683 --> 35:04.018
- "Davis."
- Yeah, they're Matt's.

35:06.480 --> 35:08.189
And they're old.

35:09.608 --> 35:12.651
And yet the label isn't faded
in the slightest.

35:12.778 --> 35:15.905
Fake old.
$100 for the homeless look.

35:16.823 --> 35:19.658
What? Kids aren't
pretentious in England?

35:20.744 --> 35:21.827
Chi was wearing
a different brand.

35:21.953 --> 35:23.788
How could they both
have been contaminated?

35:23.914 --> 35:25.581
That is the question
for the ages.

35:25.707 --> 35:27.666
Meantime, get these tested.

35:57.739 --> 36:00.950
I never bother to wash
new clothes before I wear them.

36:01.076 --> 36:02.952
Right. Your wife does.

36:03.119 --> 36:04.995
She likes you feeling
nice and comfortable.

36:05.121 --> 36:06.580
Hey, I'm a man.

36:06.748 --> 36:10.000
I don't have time for laundry.
I'm saving lives here.

36:11.711 --> 36:13.003
No, she doesn't
wash them, either.

36:13.129 --> 36:17.174
So your skin absorbs a little dye,
the odd chemical here and there.

36:17.300 --> 36:20.010
You know me,
Mr. Living-on-the-Edge.

36:20.136 --> 36:21.971
Judging by the self-importance
of your strut,

36:22.097 --> 36:24.014
you have identified
the chemical in question.

36:24.140 --> 36:25.599
Phosdrin.

36:26.893 --> 36:27.935
Hit them with the hydrolase.

36:28.061 --> 36:31.105
- Chi's parents said yes, but...
- Mighty Mom said no.

36:31.773 --> 36:33.065
Well, she's gonna
feel like a million bucks

36:33.191 --> 36:36.151
when Chi lives
and her son dies.

36:36.444 --> 36:37.987
Send Cameron.

36:38.113 --> 36:40.155
She's the only one of you
who's managed to talk her into anything.

36:40.282 --> 36:42.575
Not this time.
Matt's mom won't make a move

36:42.701 --> 36:45.786
until she gets that
opinion from the CDC.

36:47.497 --> 36:49.498
Godot would be faster.

37:22.657 --> 37:24.325
What is this?

37:25.493 --> 37:27.411
Thought I'd hang out.

37:29.122 --> 37:30.706
In case
you change your mind.

37:33.084 --> 37:36.086
Then I could give Matt
the medicine right away.

37:42.177 --> 37:44.303
Don't worry.
I've got time.

37:46.514 --> 37:50.434
- The CDC promised they'd call.
- I'm sure they will.

37:50.936 --> 37:53.604
Maybe tomorrow.
Maybe the day after.

37:54.314 --> 37:57.024
It takes time to
review faxed records.

37:57.400 --> 37:58.525
Then they'll
probably tell you

37:58.652 --> 38:01.779
they can't make a decision
based on faxed records.

38:04.074 --> 38:05.699
This is Suzie.

38:06.409 --> 38:08.953
She's never gonna marry him.
No money.

38:09.704 --> 38:12.498
What makes you think
you're right this time?

38:12.791 --> 38:15.042
Same reason as last time.

38:18.672 --> 38:22.216
If you wanna see how the other kid
does first, that's okay.

38:22.342 --> 38:23.384
Might help you.

38:24.135 --> 38:26.053
Although there's
a real good chance...

38:26.179 --> 38:28.430
What?
Matt might kick off?

38:29.724 --> 38:31.058
That's a little blunt.

38:31.643 --> 38:33.185
I was gonna say
"run out of time",

38:33.311 --> 38:37.106
or just kind of
let my voice trail off.

38:46.992 --> 38:47.825
Hello?

38:48.910 --> 38:50.911
Yes, this is Margo Davis.

38:55.208 --> 38:58.085
But you have his records.
I sent them.

39:01.923 --> 39:03.757
Yes, I understand.

39:11.224 --> 39:12.933
They can't help me.

39:14.144 --> 39:15.769
They haven't seen him.

39:15.895 --> 39:17.938
- They can't make a decision...
- Give it to him.

39:29.743 --> 39:33.579
"The CDC is unable to give an opinion
at this time, ma'am.

39:33.705 --> 39:37.124
We're gonna have a doctor
in your area next week."

39:37.500 --> 39:39.501
You fooled her
with that?

40:50.657 --> 40:51.990
House!

41:31.364 --> 41:32.531
So I'm gonna be cured?

41:32.657 --> 41:35.784
As long as you don't wear
any more poison pants.

41:36.870 --> 41:38.162
I'm sorry, Mom.

41:38.288 --> 41:39.705
I knew the pants
were stolen.

41:40.456 --> 41:42.332
They were only five bucks.

41:42.458 --> 41:43.876
You're gonna give me
hell, aren't you?

41:44.002 --> 41:46.753
Honey, I'm just
glad you're alive.

41:46.880 --> 41:49.464
Let's get you home
so you can rest.

41:49.924 --> 41:52.217
Maybe I am too hard on you.

41:52.343 --> 41:54.845
You don't have to make up
that test till next week.

41:54.971 --> 41:58.265
You can stay in bed
and work on your applications.

41:58.391 --> 42:01.476
Some guy was selling pants off the back
of his truck near the school.

42:02.061 --> 42:04.104
When he wasn't busy
as a clothing entrepreneur,

42:04.230 --> 42:06.899
he did day labor
at a cornfield out on Route 1.

42:07.025 --> 42:08.525
He used the same
truck for both jobs.

42:08.651 --> 42:12.196
So he spilled pesticide on the pants
and was too lazy to clean up.

42:12.322 --> 42:15.240
Real question is
why are you still here?

42:16.117 --> 42:19.953
Why aren't you out there
making up with the joyful mother?

42:20.788 --> 42:23.749
- Why would I do that?
- No reason at all.

42:23.958 --> 42:26.835
If you don't care
about her or her son.

42:33.509 --> 42:34.968
Dr. House.

42:36.137 --> 42:37.721
The CDC called

42:39.057 --> 42:41.683
- again.
- Oops.

42:45.021 --> 42:46.021
Who are those guys?

42:46.147 --> 42:49.274
They're the arrogant jerks
that saved your life.
