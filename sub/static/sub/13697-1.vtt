00:08.542 --> 00:11.679
I'm Oz, the great and powerful.

00:11.745 --> 00:14.382
Who are you?

00:14.448 --> 00:16.149
Now, give me those ruby slippers

00:16.216 --> 00:17.985
or your dog goes into the river.

00:18.052 --> 00:20.621
No, please! Take the slippers.

00:23.757 --> 00:25.126
I should have remembered.

00:25.193 --> 00:27.128
Those slippers will
never come off

00:27.195 --> 00:29.097
as long as you're alive.

00:30.364 --> 00:33.234
How about a little fire,
Scarecrow?

00:34.768 --> 00:36.570
Oh, I'm burning!
I'm burning!

00:36.637 --> 00:38.639
You cursed rat!

00:38.706 --> 00:39.973
Look what you've done!

00:40.040 --> 00:42.643
I'm melting. Melting!

00:42.710 --> 00:45.846
- What a world!
- I didn't mean to kill her.

00:45.913 --> 00:46.980
Really, I didn't.

00:47.047 --> 00:49.283
It's just that he was on fire.

00:49.350 --> 00:53.020
Hail to Dorothy.
The Wicked Witch is dead.

00:53.087 --> 00:55.923
Please, sir. We've done
what you've told us.

00:55.989 --> 00:58.792
We've brought you the broom stick
of the Wicked Witch of the West.

00:58.859 --> 01:00.128
Can you send me home?

01:00.194 --> 01:01.962
You don't need to be
helped any longer.

01:02.029 --> 01:06.066
- You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
- I have?

01:06.134 --> 01:08.136
There's no place like home.

01:08.202 --> 01:10.904
There's no place like home.

01:10.971 --> 01:12.773
There's no place like home.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.544
And then I was back here.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.579
Well, she's all right now.
Thank heaven.

01:18.646 --> 01:20.781
Oh, but I wasn't all right,
Aunt Em.

01:20.848 --> 01:22.650
We were in terrible danger.

01:22.716 --> 01:25.153
We kept asking people
to send us home.

01:25.219 --> 01:26.554
And they sent us home.

01:28.222 --> 01:31.192
Doesn't anyone believe me?

01:31.259 --> 01:34.495
Anyway, it's all right
because I'm home again.

01:34.562 --> 01:38.499
And this is my room.
And I love you all.

01:38.566 --> 01:42.336
And, oh, Auntie Em,
there's no place like home!

01:43.637 --> 01:45.439
I've heard Dorothy
spin some yarns

01:45.506 --> 01:47.241
but that one takes the cake!

01:47.308 --> 01:49.510
Wicked witches,
talking scarecrows,

01:49.577 --> 01:53.013
lamb, what an imagination
that child has!

01:53.080 --> 01:54.682
They think I made it all up.

01:54.748 --> 01:57.585
If there was only someway
to make them believe.

02:01.455 --> 02:02.990
Ruby slippers.

02:03.056 --> 02:06.494
Jerry, that's brilliant. They'll
have to believe me now.

02:07.728 --> 02:10.130
Uncle Henry, Auntie Em,
will you see…

02:10.198 --> 02:13.501
- Yee-haw!
- Oh, no.

02:13.567 --> 02:17.205
Reach for the sky you peyotes.

02:17.271 --> 02:18.872
I'm a regular Buffalo Bill.

02:18.939 --> 02:20.941
Where on earth
did you get those things?

02:21.008 --> 02:23.911
Ha ha! Our traveling Wild West
Show got caught up in the twister.

02:23.977 --> 02:27.781
It dropped spangled saddles and
rhinestone boots all over the county.

02:27.848 --> 02:29.917
- Go back to work
you clowns… -

02:29.983 --> 02:31.752
- They farm's still in shambles and
you're playing dress up. -

02:31.819 --> 02:35.155
Looky there, even Dorothy
got into the act.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.025
It's okay, boys.

02:38.091 --> 02:41.495

- Get off our farm!

08:43.924 --> 08:48.228
What in the world…
Stop!

08:48.295 --> 08:51.364
- You dare lay a finger on our animals, I will…
- Dorothy, please.

08:51.431 --> 08:54.067
But Uncle Henry, they can't
just come here and take…

08:54.134 --> 08:58.071
I sympathize, neighbor Gale.
I surely do.

08:58.138 --> 09:01.575
I was once a poor, dirt
scratching farmer like yourself.

09:01.642 --> 09:03.510
I know every penny counts.

09:05.078 --> 09:08.582
But as that paper from the
sheriff clearly states,

09:08.649 --> 09:10.884
the law is on my side.

09:10.951 --> 09:14.855
I won't stand for this, Lucius Bibb.
You can't just be taking our animals.

09:14.922 --> 09:17.257
Oh, if you dare lay
a finger on them!

09:17.324 --> 09:19.660
Oh, now, now, Ms. Dorothy…

09:19.727 --> 09:24.497
It seems during the recent tornado,
some of your uncle's pigs broke free

09:24.564 --> 09:28.101
and devoured my
entire watermelon patch.

09:28.168 --> 09:29.837
And as you know,

09:29.903 --> 09:34.541
I can't make Luscious Lucius' world
famous watermelon barbeque sauce

09:34.608 --> 09:36.677
with empty melons, now can I?

09:36.744 --> 09:39.780
Those aren't the only empty
melons he's got to worry about.

09:50.223 --> 09:52.059
Whoa!

09:57.597 --> 10:01.201
Fortunately, I have a solution
that will profit us all.

10:02.836 --> 10:05.973
I'm running a big booth
at the Kansas state fair.

10:06.039 --> 10:08.942
I need meat, you need money.

10:09.009 --> 10:11.411
So, I'm willing to
take my payment

10:11.478 --> 10:13.146
in livestock.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.382
Oh, you awful little troll!
Who gave you the right to…

10:15.448 --> 10:17.550
- Now Dorothy…
- But Uncle Henry you can't let him take…

10:17.617 --> 10:21.421
Why don't you run along and do your chores?
This is grown up business.

10:21.488 --> 10:25.993
Including these little nuggets.

10:26.059 --> 10:27.661
Why, there's gotta be
a way out of this.

10:27.728 --> 10:30.230
Come on everybody, think.
Use your brains.

10:32.132 --> 10:35.168
Oh yes, we'll give you all the
eggs our hens lay for a month.

10:35.235 --> 10:36.369
For free.

10:37.771 --> 10:40.373
Yuck! I can't stand eggs.

10:40.440 --> 10:44.845
The only thing a chicken is
good for is drumsticks.

10:44.912 --> 10:47.915
You see? Mr. Tabby cat agrees.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.383
Can't you give us
just a little more time?

10:50.450 --> 10:52.152
I'll tell you what,

10:52.219 --> 10:56.656
I'll give you 24 hours to
scrape together the cash.

10:56.724 --> 10:59.727
If not, I'll cart off
everything that

10:59.793 --> 11:02.629
clucks, moos or oinks.

11:04.131 --> 11:06.166
Well, I'm off to the fair.

11:06.233 --> 11:08.135
Pleasure doing
business with you.

11:08.201 --> 11:11.071
Oh, you can keep
the cat and mouse!

11:11.138 --> 11:15.508
Well, there's nothing we can do but go
into town and re-mortgage the farm.

11:15.575 --> 11:18.378
- Again.
- Ah, we're drowning in debt as it is.

11:18.445 --> 11:21.749
We'll all pitch in Mrs. Gale.
We can get odd jobs in town.

11:21.815 --> 11:24.885
- Sure, I can chop wood.
- And I can punch cattle.

11:24.952 --> 11:27.755
And I can hammer
and paint and saw.

11:30.123 --> 11:32.292
You could stay here, small fry.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.895
Oh, but Uncle Henry,
I wanna help too.

11:34.962 --> 11:36.797
You can help by
watching the farm.

11:36.864 --> 11:38.732
That's a big enough job for you.

11:39.432 --> 11:40.868
But this is my home too.

11:40.934 --> 11:44.037
I want to help save it.
I know I can.

11:44.104 --> 11:47.440
- This is grown up business, Dorothy.
- Oh, I'm 15.

11:48.308 --> 11:49.376
Practically.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.144
In eight months.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.781
- If you really wanna help…
- Yes?

11:53.847 --> 11:55.182
Just stay out of trouble.

11:56.784 --> 11:58.485
Boys, keep an eye on her.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.690
That's all they think I can do.

12:03.757 --> 12:06.159
Come on, boys, let's go.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.928
Toto and I will take the house.

12:07.995 --> 12:10.297
Tom, Jerry, you've got the barn.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.868
May be we could fix
those windows.

12:14.935 --> 12:17.070
That'd show Auntie Em
and Uncle Henry.

12:21.241 --> 12:24.144
This is creepy, Toto.

12:32.285 --> 12:35.022
You're right. I've a funny feeling
I should keep these close.

14:15.255 --> 14:18.291
What's going on in here?

14:25.698 --> 14:27.500
Help!

14:28.801 --> 14:30.670
Oh, no. Help!

14:42.615 --> 14:44.117
Let me go!

14:44.184 --> 14:46.987
Oh, you terrible…

15:14.447 --> 15:17.951
Jiminy Crickets!
How do you steer this thing?

15:21.521 --> 15:23.123
Whoa!

15:35.902 --> 15:38.938
- I got you.
- Scarecrow, it's you!

15:39.006 --> 15:40.707
Actually, it's all of us.

15:40.773 --> 15:43.576
Oh, Tin man! Lion!

15:43.643 --> 15:45.512
Hi, there, kiddo.

15:45.578 --> 15:49.049
We better save the hello's
until we get rid of him.

15:53.686 --> 15:55.022
Look out!

16:02.262 --> 16:03.997
Where did he come from?

16:04.064 --> 16:06.066
From Oz, the same as us.

16:06.133 --> 16:09.436
Though getting back
there might be tricky.

16:09.502 --> 16:12.872
Until we do, let's have
a look around.

16:12.939 --> 16:15.942
So, this is the famous Kansas.

16:16.009 --> 16:18.578
Not as bright and shiny
as I expected.

16:18.645 --> 16:21.248
- It's rather…
- Drab.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.716
Kinda scary.

16:23.783 --> 16:26.686
Oh, I don't know. The locals
look friendly enough.

16:26.753 --> 16:29.622
Morning friend, how's
the view up there?

16:35.195 --> 16:38.065
Hmm, no need to act stuck up.

16:38.131 --> 16:42.169
I must say, it's wonderful to see you
again but, what are you doing here?

16:42.235 --> 16:43.803
We had to come.

16:43.870 --> 16:46.073
- There's big trouble back in Oz.
- Terrible trouble.

16:46.139 --> 16:47.607
It happened soon after you left.

16:47.674 --> 16:51.244
- On our very first Dorothy Day.
- Dorothy Day?

16:51.311 --> 16:53.813
Why, of course.
You're our national hero.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.482
Oh, me?

16:58.218 --> 17:00.787
There we were
in the town square.

17:01.921 --> 17:03.456
Citizens of Oz,

17:03.523 --> 17:06.492
though our good friend, Dorothy
Gale has returned to Kansas,

17:06.559 --> 17:08.795
we've built this
statue in her honor.

17:14.101 --> 17:18.704
And thanks to Glinda's magic potion,
we can bring the statue to life

17:18.771 --> 17:20.240
for a whole day,

17:20.307 --> 17:22.875
oh, it will be just like
the kid was here in person.

17:22.942 --> 17:26.713
And remind us of all the
good things she brought to Oz.

17:26.779 --> 17:28.415
Things like peace,

17:28.481 --> 17:32.119
freedom, happiness and monkeys.

17:32.185 --> 17:34.354
- Monkeys?
- Yeah, monkeys.

17:35.988 --> 17:38.057
Monkeys!

17:43.763 --> 17:45.765
Who's that? Who's that?

17:49.869 --> 17:52.139
I don't understand, with the
Wicked Witch gone,

17:52.205 --> 17:54.006
the monkeys have
no reason to attack.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.242
Tell them that.

17:58.178 --> 18:03.383
Oh, dear! I hereby banish you
monkeys to the end of… Oh…

18:07.354 --> 18:09.422
Cut it out!

18:09.489 --> 18:11.358
Pick on someone your own size!

18:18.198 --> 18:22.635
Put 'em up, put 'em up. I'll
ride you airsick banana addicts.

18:22.702 --> 18:26.439
Who's first? I'll take you all on!
One at a time.

18:29.376 --> 18:33.246
One at a time!
One at a time.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.586
Come back and fight,
you big cowards.

18:39.652 --> 18:42.355
Hey! Let me out.
This ain't over, see.

18:42.422 --> 18:45.625
Whoa! What's happening?

18:45.692 --> 18:48.195
Oh, it's an earthquake!

18:51.164 --> 18:52.565
Whoa!

18:57.804 --> 19:00.940
And all this didn't compare
to what happened next.

19:01.007 --> 19:02.575
Oh, what did happen next?

19:02.642 --> 19:07.280
That is when I decided to take
the bull by the horns.

19:07.347 --> 19:08.915
Ain't that right, Scarecrow?

19:08.981 --> 19:11.651
I haven't any idea of
what you're talking about.

19:12.185 --> 19:13.720
Me neither.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.224
Please fellas,
tell me what happened.

19:17.290 --> 19:20.560
Well, out came a
horrible bunch of nomes,

19:20.627 --> 19:23.162
followed by the Nome King.

19:25.198 --> 19:27.334
Tell me when it's over.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.369
Ruggedo, you cannot do this.

19:29.436 --> 19:31.938
Oh, give me back my wand.

19:33.306 --> 19:36.843
If anyone's gonna wave
that wand, Glinda dear,

19:36.909 --> 19:39.145
it's going to be me.

19:39.212 --> 19:41.348
Oh. Oh, no.

19:41.414 --> 19:42.782
You can't do this.

19:42.849 --> 19:46.653
Boys, I'd like to converse
with the Strawman.

19:53.593 --> 19:56.896
What do you want, Ruggedo?

19:56.963 --> 20:01.268
That's Mr. Ruggedo to you,
brainiac.

20:01.334 --> 20:03.970
And it's not about what I want,

20:04.036 --> 20:06.105
it's about what I get.

20:06.172 --> 20:07.407
See?

20:07.474 --> 20:09.842
And there's only
one more thing I want.

20:09.909 --> 20:12.178
To destroy that upstart,

20:12.245 --> 20:13.780
Dorothy Gale.

20:13.846 --> 20:15.848
Me? But why?

20:15.915 --> 20:18.084
I've never even met
any Nome King.

20:18.150 --> 20:20.953
You've made quite a reputation
for yourself in Oz.

20:21.020 --> 20:24.223
With the way you've been
bumpin' off wicked witches,

20:24.291 --> 20:25.692
you're the one to beat.

20:25.758 --> 20:28.127
After the Nome King threw us
in the dungeon,

20:28.194 --> 20:30.930
Glinda used the last of her
magic to help us escape.

20:30.997 --> 20:34.834
Ruggedo was using his powers
to make a tunnel to Kansas.

20:34.901 --> 20:37.304
We followed his flying
monkeys to warn you.

20:37.370 --> 20:40.840
But that still doesn't explain
why he would want to destroy me.

20:43.042 --> 20:44.811
The ruby slippers?

20:44.877 --> 20:48.047
Glinda did say their magic
is very powerful.

20:48.114 --> 20:50.216
That figures.

20:50.283 --> 20:54.854
The Nome King scouring Oz for every magical
doo-dad he can lay his grubby hands on.

20:54.921 --> 20:56.989
He's a most
unpleasant character.

20:57.056 --> 21:00.627
It seems only his great fear of
the Wizard kept him underground.

21:02.395 --> 21:03.696
The Wizard.

21:03.763 --> 21:07.233
He would know how to defeat
the Nome King.

21:07.300 --> 21:10.703
But The Wizard flew away in his balloon.

21:12.138 --> 21:14.040
He could be anywhere.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.309
Or nowhere.

21:16.376 --> 21:18.611
How could he be nowhere?

21:18.678 --> 21:20.547
He's a wizard.
He could do anything.

21:20.613 --> 21:24.351
Think, everyone. I'm sure the answer
is staring us right in the face.

21:24.417 --> 21:25.585
There it is.

21:25.652 --> 21:27.387
"Oz, the great and powerful

21:27.454 --> 21:30.757
"appearing for a limited engagement
at the Kansas State Fair."

21:30.823 --> 21:32.792
Why, that's just down the road
in Topeka.

21:32.859 --> 21:35.628
If we can get The Wizard
to return to Oz,

21:35.695 --> 21:38.030
I'm sure he'll set
everything right.

21:38.097 --> 21:40.900
I know. We'll go with you
to show you the way.

21:43.770 --> 21:45.672
You're right, Jerry.
Our friends would attract

21:45.738 --> 21:47.774
a lot of attention
here in Kansas.

21:50.176 --> 21:52.445
There. That's perfect.

21:52.512 --> 21:55.848
Uh, uh, does this
make me look fat?

21:57.249 --> 21:58.385
Allow me.

21:58.451 --> 22:00.620
Oh, snug.

22:02.789 --> 22:06.258
We'll take the old tractor,
trailer and all.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.428
No. But why?

22:11.964 --> 22:13.600
I know they think
I'm just a kid.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.535
But I can do this. I know it.

22:15.602 --> 22:17.236
Oh, won't you let me try?

22:17.303 --> 22:18.771
I'll let you drive.

22:35.488 --> 22:37.223
Oh, we can't go anywhere.

22:37.289 --> 22:40.092
The tractor's out of gas.

22:40.159 --> 22:43.329
You have to put fluid
into a machine to make it run.

22:43.396 --> 22:45.532
Hmm. What a strange concept.

22:45.598 --> 22:47.667
Well, this is Kansas, Tin Man.

22:47.734 --> 22:50.503
Machines can't run themselves
like they do in Oz.

22:52.639 --> 22:54.441
Oh, but they will.

23:07.787 --> 23:11.223
Whoo-Whee! That stuff's
got a kick to it.

23:11.290 --> 23:13.392
Real high octane.

23:13.460 --> 23:16.463
Oh, my silvers feel brand-new.

23:16.529 --> 23:18.197
Oh, what have you done?

23:18.264 --> 23:21.267
Solved our
transportation problem.

23:21.333 --> 23:23.002
Oh, Miss Tractor,

23:23.069 --> 23:24.937
would you drive us to the fair?

23:25.371 --> 23:26.839
Please?

23:26.906 --> 23:28.875
Whoa, Nelly!

23:28.941 --> 23:32.111
Ain't you a fine bit
of craftsmanship.

23:32.178 --> 23:33.412
Oh. Oh, please.

23:33.480 --> 23:36.282
You make me tarnish.

23:36.348 --> 23:38.050
Hop on, handsome.

23:38.117 --> 23:39.786
Everyone, let's go.

23:39.852 --> 23:43.756
I ain't had this much pep
in my pistons for years.

23:43.823 --> 23:47.093
Now, hands off the steering
wheel, pussy cat. I'm drivin'.

23:47.159 --> 23:48.961
And…

23:49.028 --> 23:51.163
Stop pushing my pedals, mousey,

23:51.230 --> 23:53.432
'cause it tickles.

23:56.636 --> 23:57.804
Here we go again,

23:57.870 --> 24:00.640
off on another
whirlwind adventure.

24:00.707 --> 24:02.842
Whoa-ho!

24:02.909 --> 24:05.512
You got to watch them bumps.

24:05.578 --> 24:07.980
Whoa!

24:08.047 --> 24:10.082
Scarecrow, look at you.

24:10.149 --> 24:11.250
It's okay.

24:11.317 --> 24:13.486
I always wanted to be a hayride.

Six dollars?
But we haven't got any money.

Mmm-hmm. Thanks for coming.
Drive safely.

25:47.079 --> 25:49.215
If we can't pay,
we can't get in.

All I have are a few

28:37.649 --> 28:39.518
Oh, that ain't nothin'.

28:39.585 --> 28:44.123
We had a big tornado rip through our
back forty a couple of weeks ago.

28:44.190 --> 28:46.292
Can't you do any real magic?

28:46.358 --> 28:48.460
Real magic, you say?

28:49.728 --> 28:51.864
Ah, the very thing.

28:52.398 --> 28:53.766
Prism seeds.

28:53.833 --> 28:55.201
I say the magic words,

28:55.267 --> 28:58.637
botanicus borealis, and presto!

28:58.704 --> 29:00.472
Rainbow poppies!

29:01.841 --> 29:04.276
The national flower of
Munchkin Land.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.313
- Huh?
- Yes, thank you.

29:07.379 --> 29:08.547
And, uh, thank you.

29:10.282 --> 29:13.219
I ain't clappin'.
My leg's asleep.

29:13.285 --> 29:14.686
- This guy is…
- Let's get outta here.

29:14.753 --> 29:16.255
Who do I see about a refund?

29:16.322 --> 29:17.790
Oh, what do they know?

29:17.857 --> 29:19.758
I thought your show
was wonderful.

29:19.826 --> 29:23.029
Well, Dorothy, my dear.

29:23.095 --> 29:24.196
It's us.

29:24.263 --> 29:26.866
Oh, my goodness, it's everyone.

29:26.933 --> 29:29.969
Tom and Jerry and Toto, too.

29:30.036 --> 29:32.604
We've come to
take you back to Oz.

29:32.671 --> 29:35.074
What? And give up showbiz?

29:35.141 --> 29:37.576
You can have
your phony flowers back.

29:37.643 --> 29:38.845
They smell funny.

29:38.911 --> 29:40.847
Oh, that'll…
That'll wash out.

29:40.913 --> 29:42.348
Uh, probably.

29:44.050 --> 29:47.519
Yes. Well, in truth, I am growing
weary of the carnival circuit.

29:47.586 --> 29:52.058
Uh, the folks hereabouts just
don't crave Oz-style magic.

29:52.124 --> 29:53.759
Well, you know who does.

29:53.826 --> 29:55.227
The Nome King.

29:55.294 --> 29:56.628
Ruggedo?

29:56.695 --> 29:59.665
Oh, don't tell me that
grizzled old gopher is back.

29:59.731 --> 30:01.433
Yes, and meaner than ever.

30:01.500 --> 30:03.735
He's seized control
of the Emerald City.

30:03.802 --> 30:06.873
Then we'll just
seize it right back!

30:06.939 --> 30:10.342
Boys, fetch my thaumaturgical
portmanteau.

30:13.545 --> 30:15.447
There! My magic bag.

30:28.194 --> 30:30.029
No time to dawdle, my lads.

30:30.096 --> 30:31.763
How will we get back to Oz?

30:31.830 --> 30:33.465
Oh-ho! Well,
that's no problem.

30:33.532 --> 30:37.169
I have my trusty balloon
tethered right out back.

30:39.939 --> 30:41.207
All aboard!

30:41.273 --> 30:44.510
First class accommodations
for everybody.

30:44.576 --> 30:48.580
Ooh! If this is first class,
I'd hate to see coach.

30:50.582 --> 30:52.084
What do we do now?

30:52.151 --> 30:55.787
We simply wait for the next
tornado to sweep us away to Oz.

30:55.854 --> 30:59.291
There should be another whirlwind
along in three to five weeks.

30:59.358 --> 31:01.427
Can't your magic
speed things up?

31:01.493 --> 31:05.797
I'm sorry, but the only tornado
I can summon is bottle sized.

31:05.864 --> 31:11.437
Of course, if I had some way
of making it bigger, I, why I…

31:11.503 --> 31:13.405
Oh! I know!

31:15.574 --> 31:18.945
Don't we have enough
tornados in these parts?

31:19.011 --> 31:20.879
Oh! This has to work.

31:25.517 --> 31:26.852
Tornado bottle, please!

31:26.919 --> 31:29.421
Uh, just a drop
or two should do it.

31:38.730 --> 31:39.898
Oh, yikes!

31:39.966 --> 31:42.601
Either wind or monsoon!

31:48.040 --> 31:49.475
Twister!

31:57.049 --> 32:00.852
Well… Look at all them
hungry fair-goers.

32:00.919 --> 32:02.221
Line up, folks!

32:02.288 --> 32:06.092
I got plenty of baby backs
for everyone!

32:06.858 --> 32:09.461
Great hell in hot links!

32:11.597 --> 32:15.167
Hey!
Good grub on this flight!

32:23.009 --> 32:24.143
This is it!

32:24.210 --> 32:25.978
Next stop, Oz!

32:26.045 --> 32:28.480
But I pray we're not too late.

I hope you brought the

Ooh, right here, sir.

35:13.179 --> 35:15.113
Just as you commanded.

35:16.114 --> 35:18.817
Oh, ah! Good, good!

35:18.884 --> 35:21.420
Oh, her potions, her spells!

35:21.487 --> 35:24.990
Everything I'll need to finish
that Dorothy forever.

35:25.056 --> 35:28.660
What's shakin', King?
Let me out and let's agitate.

35:28.727 --> 35:31.197
I've heard about this bug.

35:31.263 --> 35:33.465
I'll save him for later.

35:33.532 --> 35:36.868
Useful, but still not
what I need.

35:36.935 --> 35:38.604
I want those ruby slippers!

35:38.670 --> 35:42.774
I won't rest until the sparkling
beauties are on my feet.

35:42.841 --> 35:46.345
All this because he wants
a pair of red pumps?

35:46.412 --> 35:49.147
Don't judge, new guy.

35:50.416 --> 35:53.319
Oh-ho! Here's a beaut,
Your Nomeship.

35:53.385 --> 35:55.654
Enchanted owl eggs.

35:55.721 --> 35:56.955
Eggs!

35:57.022 --> 35:59.024
Nomes hate eggs.

35:59.090 --> 36:01.760
We're deathly allergic.

36:01.827 --> 36:05.331
Sorry, maybe that should have
been covered in orientation.

36:06.265 --> 36:07.833
Crash that balloon!

36:07.899 --> 36:09.368
Dispose of everyone on board!

36:09.435 --> 36:12.538
But bring me the ruby slippers.

36:12.604 --> 36:14.940
Uh, beggin' your pardon,
Your Nomeship,

36:15.006 --> 36:18.377
but what's so special about
those ruby slippers?

36:18.444 --> 36:21.713
I don't recall giving you
permission to speak!

36:23.181 --> 36:24.983
No, sir.

36:25.050 --> 36:26.318
But since you asked,

36:26.385 --> 36:28.053
as Nome King,

36:28.119 --> 36:30.789
my domain is
the land beneath Oz.

36:31.423 --> 36:32.624
That figures.

36:32.691 --> 36:35.594
All its mineral treasures
are mine.

36:36.328 --> 36:37.529
Makes sense.

36:37.596 --> 36:39.965
Including its jewels.

36:41.032 --> 36:43.302
Of course.

36:44.636 --> 36:48.440
My soft-hearted father,
the previous Nome King,

36:48.507 --> 36:50.942
gave away emeralds
to make this city.

36:51.009 --> 36:53.745
And magical rubies
for the ruby slippers.

36:53.812 --> 36:56.415
I want them back!

36:56.482 --> 36:58.650
But if you take
the emeralds back,

36:58.717 --> 37:02.288
that means you'd have
to move the entire city.

37:02.354 --> 37:04.490
Underground.

37:04.556 --> 37:06.525
Which I will do, once the power

37:06.592 --> 37:09.461
of the ruby slippers
is mine to command.

37:09.528 --> 37:12.831
That won't be long now.

37:14.165 --> 37:16.468
Oh-ho! We made it!

37:18.804 --> 37:20.739
Oh no! Look!

37:23.709 --> 37:24.876
Oh no!

37:24.943 --> 37:27.479
Stand by to repel borders!

37:35.186 --> 37:37.889
Oh no!

37:38.990 --> 37:41.327
No!

37:43.261 --> 37:45.364
And don't come back!

37:46.031 --> 37:48.567
Let go!

37:51.269 --> 37:52.971
Oh my!

37:53.038 --> 37:55.941
Hold on!

38:15.193 --> 38:17.329
Good shooting, ace!

38:17.396 --> 38:19.798
This hurts me more than
it does you, monkeys!

38:22.033 --> 38:24.102
Ooh, that's gonna hurt too.

38:26.405 --> 38:27.973
Ah! Oh!

38:28.039 --> 38:29.441
Never fear!

38:29.508 --> 38:32.811
I'll repair it with
my Magical Stick 'em Stuff.

38:33.512 --> 38:35.481
One blast should do it.

38:36.748 --> 38:38.484
That's stickin' it to 'em.

38:42.854 --> 38:45.724
Oh, no!
They're carrying us away!

38:45.791 --> 38:47.893
Bail out!

38:57.469 --> 38:59.971
Uh, it's springy! Whoa!

39:03.442 --> 39:05.444
Are you okay, Tom?

39:06.311 --> 39:07.813
Oh-ho! Unhand me,

39:07.879 --> 39:10.882
you primeval…
primates!

39:10.949 --> 39:13.251
Unhand me!

39:13.318 --> 39:14.653
Wizard!

39:14.720 --> 39:18.089
Go on without me,
I'll join you when I can!

39:18.156 --> 39:19.725
If I can.

39:23.328 --> 39:26.297
Well, I'm certain he'll be okay.

39:26.364 --> 39:29.100
Sure. He's a wizard, right?

39:29.167 --> 39:31.302
Ha! Wizard deluxe.

39:31.369 --> 39:33.439
Yeah! He's fine!

39:35.407 --> 39:38.309
Well, it's up to us
to carry on without him.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.612
Anyone know where we are?

39:41.580 --> 39:43.214
It's the Ferocious Forest.

39:43.281 --> 39:45.984
The Munchkin River
is just beyond those trees!

39:46.051 --> 39:49.855
Oh! Why that river runs right
through the Emerald City!

39:49.921 --> 39:51.723
I'll cut some wood for a raft.

39:51.790 --> 39:56.061
And we'll float in right under the
Nome King's gnarly nose hairs.

39:58.029 --> 39:59.164
Gnarly?

39:59.230 --> 40:02.000
I call it
the ruffled, rugged look.

40:02.067 --> 40:04.736
I could let them sail
into my clutches.

40:04.803 --> 40:07.138
But that Dorothy girl is tricky!

40:07.205 --> 40:10.676
Unlikely as it seems, she
could find a way to stop me.

40:11.743 --> 40:13.144
Being the Nome King and all,

40:13.211 --> 40:15.481
you could attack them
from underground.

40:19.184 --> 40:21.352
Did I ask for ideas?

40:21.419 --> 40:23.188
No, sir.

40:23.254 --> 40:25.624
But, that's not bad.

40:25.691 --> 40:26.925
If I can delay them,

40:26.992 --> 40:29.861
I'll grab Dorothy before
she reaches the river.

40:30.762 --> 40:32.330
What's jumpin', Jackson?

40:32.397 --> 40:34.432
I've got a job for you.

40:34.500 --> 40:38.870
Ha! A frail, a bale, a pail,
and four flea-bitten tails.

40:38.937 --> 40:42.541
I need you to stall them
as only a Jitterbug can.

40:42.608 --> 40:44.309
No big, Kingy.

40:44.375 --> 40:46.377
Those cats out there, it's right
out of their jiving pants.

40:46.444 --> 40:47.946
Pop the plugsy, Mugsy.

40:49.080 --> 40:50.716
Milliweedy, millirooney.

40:50.782 --> 40:52.417
Dig you later, King,
and soon-ey.

40:55.954 --> 40:58.524
This sure is a creepy place.

40:58.590 --> 41:01.259
Excuse me, this is my home.

41:01.326 --> 41:03.061
It ain't creepy.

41:03.128 --> 41:04.630
It's terrifying.

41:09.535 --> 41:10.669
Oh, what's that?

Without might,
it's a current affair

43:32.878 --> 43:34.412
Whoa! Hey!

43:34.479 --> 43:36.948
Wait! Wait! Wait!

43:37.015 --> 43:39.284
This is mystifying, mortifying.

43:39.350 --> 43:41.419
Quite absurd, embarrassing.

43:41.486 --> 43:44.255
Exasperating, even awkward.

43:45.957 --> 43:48.026
Hey, now Kansas,
don't put me on ice.

43:48.093 --> 43:50.395
Jitterbug's honor, I swear!

43:50.461 --> 43:51.797
I'll be nice.

43:51.863 --> 43:53.231
Maybe if you behave.

43:53.298 --> 43:55.566
- Thanks, boys.
- Wait…

43:55.633 --> 43:57.335
What are you doing?

43:57.402 --> 43:58.804
The spell is broken.

43:58.870 --> 44:00.105
Don't stop me now, Jackson.

44:00.171 --> 44:02.874
I'm cookin' with gas.
Oh, the jitter.

44:02.941 --> 44:05.410
Let's get out of here before
anything else happens.

44:10.882 --> 44:12.383
There's the river.

44:15.954 --> 44:17.422
What's happening?

44:17.488 --> 44:19.858
- Earthquake!
- Oh, no! Not again!

44:24.763 --> 44:26.331
Dorothy!

44:27.833 --> 44:30.001
Gah! Hang on!

44:30.668 --> 44:32.503
Oh! Oh my!

44:35.373 --> 44:36.875
Look out!

44:44.750 --> 44:45.884
Oh, that's underhanded,

44:45.951 --> 44:48.119
at the very least undergrounded.

44:50.088 --> 44:52.490
I hate playing the villain.

44:52.557 --> 44:54.692
But a job's a job.

44:54.760 --> 44:55.927
Throw him in the river.

44:55.994 --> 44:58.496
Ah! Don't do that! I'll rust!

44:58.563 --> 45:00.866
Even worse I'll… I'll sink!

45:00.932 --> 45:03.869
Oh! We got you, Tinny!

45:03.935 --> 45:06.838
Here we go, being naughty again.

45:06.905 --> 45:10.175
You kiddies may want
to close your eyes now.

45:10.241 --> 45:11.576
Okay, you nomes.

45:11.642 --> 45:13.378
Let's shake it.

45:15.546 --> 45:17.015
Whoa!

45:18.750 --> 45:20.418
That's a stretch!

45:31.229 --> 45:32.831
Help!

45:32.898 --> 45:35.867
I… I can't swim!

45:49.781 --> 45:52.283
Grab the rope!
Hook it around the Tin Man.

45:52.350 --> 45:53.418
We'll do the rest.

46:28.519 --> 46:29.988
Hang on, Toto.

46:32.323 --> 46:34.893
Looks like your friends
escaped, missy.

46:34.960 --> 46:38.029
But you won't be so lucky.

46:38.096 --> 46:40.031
Take them to the Nome King.

46:46.037 --> 46:48.739
Why, I've got an idea.
Play along.

46:48.806 --> 46:51.076
Careful, Dorothy.

46:51.142 --> 46:52.643
It's cramped in here.

46:52.710 --> 46:56.814
You know those nomes
can't make really big tunnels.

46:57.782 --> 46:59.317
Can't make a big tunnel?

46:59.384 --> 47:02.620
Listen, straw head, you could
run a train through here.

47:02.687 --> 47:05.423
Why, I've seen bigger gopher
holes in our carrot patch.

47:05.490 --> 47:08.927
Ohh! Is that so?
Jump to it, nomes.

47:20.405 --> 47:23.374
There, how do you like that,
missy?

47:34.452 --> 47:35.553
Careful, men.

47:35.620 --> 47:37.322
We don't want to start a…

47:38.990 --> 47:40.425
…cave-in.

48:02.180 --> 48:03.949
That was very brave.

48:04.015 --> 48:05.483
Are you all right?

48:11.356 --> 48:13.358
And they call my ticker noisy.

48:13.424 --> 48:19.430
Your Highness, allow me to
present Jerry Mouse of Kansas.

48:19.497 --> 48:20.598
Charmed, I'm sure.

48:20.665 --> 48:23.168
Jerry, meet my good friend,

48:23.234 --> 48:26.371
the Mouse Queen of Oz.

48:26.437 --> 48:30.875
I must say, Kansas mice
have impeccable manners.

48:30.942 --> 48:35.080
We have to get to the Emerald
City as fast as possible.

48:35.146 --> 48:37.983
But I'm still a little rusty.

48:39.584 --> 48:40.952
Bring my coat.

48:50.461 --> 48:53.164
I would be honored
if you would ride with me.

49:09.480 --> 49:11.649
At least,
they're out of trouble.

49:11.716 --> 49:14.219
But we can't swim the river.

49:14.285 --> 49:17.655
So we'll have
to take the long way,

49:17.722 --> 49:20.158
through the forest.

49:22.593 --> 49:26.331
I was once what
you are, Tom, my boy.

49:26.397 --> 49:30.901
Yeah, I wasn't always the steadfast
hero type you see today.

49:30.968 --> 49:33.004
No-o-o!

49:33.071 --> 49:34.472
Now it's my turn,

49:34.539 --> 49:38.343
to help a fellow feline
become fearless.

49:40.111 --> 49:42.347
It's a good thing
we ditched those guards.

49:42.413 --> 49:45.316
Now, we can sneak into
the Emerald City undetected.

49:45.383 --> 49:47.185
Maybe if we go
to the Wizard's Palace,

49:47.252 --> 49:49.654
we might find something
magical to help us.

49:49.720 --> 49:52.723
- Oh! That's a great idea!
- Come on!

50:37.102 --> 50:38.269
We made it.

50:38.336 --> 50:40.705
And the Nome King
has no idea we're here.

50:40.771 --> 50:44.642
Well, you gotta get up pretty early
in the morning to outsmart me.

50:44.709 --> 50:49.114
My brain is just too sharp
for his corny traps.

50:53.984 --> 50:56.554
Well, as I live and breathe.

50:56.621 --> 50:58.623
It's the brainiac.

50:58.689 --> 51:03.628
And miss goody two-shoes,
all caught in the same trap.

51:03.694 --> 51:07.298
You may notice
a few changes around here.

51:13.037 --> 51:14.439
Did I ever tell you
when I took on

51:14.505 --> 51:16.507
an entire herd of elephants?
Hmm?

51:16.574 --> 51:19.277
I just look 'em straight
in the eye. Yup.

51:19.344 --> 51:21.646
Them beady little red eyes.

51:21.712 --> 51:23.581
I knew I was surrounded,

51:23.648 --> 51:26.151
so I gave 'em the old one-two-four.

51:26.217 --> 51:29.620
Yep, nothing gets past
my cat-like reflexes.

51:32.022 --> 51:33.891
Then again, you know that.

51:33.958 --> 51:35.426
You're a cat.

51:36.227 --> 51:38.629
Hey. You're not Tom.

51:38.696 --> 51:41.065
But if you're not Tom,
that means…

51:42.800 --> 51:44.169
Carry the two…

51:44.235 --> 51:47.037
Jiminy Crickets! He's gone!

51:53.911 --> 51:56.314
I don't believe in spooks,
I don't believe in spooks.

51:56.381 --> 51:58.983
I don't believe in spooks,
I don't believe in spooks.

52:00.885 --> 52:02.320
Oh!

52:02.387 --> 52:06.191
Oh, imagine me!
Get all spooked over spooks.

52:06.257 --> 52:09.394
Those preposterous…

52:09.460 --> 52:12.263
Why they're nothing but
little old red light bulbs.

52:12.330 --> 52:14.199
Right guys?

52:14.265 --> 52:15.800
Oh!

52:36.887 --> 52:38.856
Oh, we're in quite a pickle.

52:38.923 --> 52:40.691
What do we do now, Dorothy?

52:40.758 --> 52:42.126
I don't know.

52:42.193 --> 52:44.529
Uncle Henry and Aunty Em
are always telling me

52:44.595 --> 52:47.698
I'm too young and to stay
out of everyone's way.

52:47.765 --> 52:49.033
And now…

52:49.099 --> 52:51.636
I'm starting to think that
they were right.

52:55.172 --> 52:57.107
Oh, don't say things like that.

52:57.174 --> 52:58.776
You can't mean it.

52:59.344 --> 53:00.845
Oh, why not?

53:02.313 --> 53:04.014
Because you're Dorothy.

53:04.081 --> 53:05.850
You always find a way.

53:09.854 --> 53:13.258
Well, okay. I'll let you
off this time easy,

53:13.324 --> 53:17.328
since you didn't realize you was
dealing with the king of the…

53:17.395 --> 53:19.464
Well, well, well.

53:19.530 --> 53:21.131
Look what cat they dragged in.

53:22.567 --> 53:24.569
That couldn't be
the ex-King of the Forest.

53:24.635 --> 53:26.804
You know, boys,
I'm very disappointed in you.

53:26.871 --> 53:29.374
You were supposed to
bring back some meat.

53:29.440 --> 53:30.875
Not a big cream puff!

53:32.277 --> 53:34.479
That's Mr. Ex-Cream Puff
to you.

53:34.545 --> 53:38.683
Besides, everyone knows I'm
the real King of the Forest.

53:38.749 --> 53:41.519
Oh, then this must be
one of your royal subjects?

53:41.586 --> 53:44.088
- Tom?
- You see, I'm on a 'seefood' diet.

53:44.154 --> 53:46.223
I eat what I see.

53:46.291 --> 53:47.858
I eat what I see.
Seefood!

53:47.925 --> 53:50.295
Well, you can't intimidate us
with these cruel methods.

53:50.361 --> 53:55.199
Me and Tomcat can take
all you can dish out.

53:55.266 --> 53:57.468
They say you've been off
fightin' witches.

53:57.535 --> 53:59.270
That sounds pretty phony.

53:59.337 --> 54:02.039
The only ever witches you've
ever finished were sand witches.

54:02.106 --> 54:04.309
Baloney!

54:04.375 --> 54:06.911
Listen, I'm runnin'
this forest now.

54:06.977 --> 54:09.213
So scat, fraidy cat!

54:09.280 --> 54:12.650
Everybody knows that tigers
can't be King of the Forest,

54:12.717 --> 54:14.218

56:42.099 --> 56:43.968
<i>♪ Oh my, oh my, oh my ♪</i>

56:44.368 --> 56:45.803
Mmm?

56:55.913 --> 56:59.684
At last, behold the dazzling beauty!

56:59.750 --> 57:01.586
Flattery will get you nowhere.

57:01.652 --> 57:03.988
Ha! I wasn't talking
about you, girly.

57:04.054 --> 57:06.491
I was talking about
the ruby slippers.

57:07.525 --> 57:08.826
Give them here.

57:08.893 --> 57:11.061
- Oh, you mustn't.
- Oh, don't worry.

57:11.128 --> 57:12.530
I won't.

57:12.597 --> 57:15.065
Hmm. Well, if I take
the slippers by force,

57:15.132 --> 57:17.067
their magic will be diminished.

57:18.368 --> 57:20.404
But perhaps you'll
surrender them

57:20.471 --> 57:23.373
- to save your friends.
- Oh.

57:23.440 --> 57:25.109
Rip the scarecrow to bits.

57:25.175 --> 57:26.544
Oh, hold on.

57:26.611 --> 57:28.378
- Wait a second!
- Mash up that Munchkin Mouse.

57:28.445 --> 57:30.515
No!

57:30.581 --> 57:32.517
Then give me the slippers.

57:33.250 --> 57:34.585
Don't do it, Dorothy!

57:35.653 --> 57:37.555
No!

57:37.622 --> 57:39.790
I won't have you hurt
because of me.

57:39.857 --> 57:41.458
Don't do it, Dorothy!

57:46.864 --> 57:49.233
Here. I'm sure
you'll look lovely in them.

57:50.400 --> 57:51.602
Ah.

57:52.903 --> 57:54.772
You really don't understand
their power, do you?

57:54.839 --> 57:59.544
These miraculous shoes reflect the
personality of whoever wears them.

57:59.610 --> 58:02.647
To you, they're ruby slippers.

58:02.713 --> 58:06.651
To me, they're blood-red boots.

58:12.022 --> 58:12.990
Beware, Ruggedo!

58:13.057 --> 58:14.424
Those who use
the Rubies for evil

58:14.491 --> 58:15.926
only come to misfortune.

58:15.993 --> 58:19.864
Ooh, ooh, I'll keep a lookout
for falling houses.

58:19.930 --> 58:23.200
Besides, I'm not evil. I'm
just taking back what's mine.

58:23.267 --> 58:25.536
Starting with this city.

58:25.603 --> 58:27.638
What? Well, what about
all the people?

58:27.705 --> 58:30.007
They're welcome to come below

58:30.074 --> 58:31.576
as my slaves.

58:31.642 --> 58:34.511
In fact, I insist on it.

58:34.579 --> 58:36.146
No, you can't!

58:36.213 --> 58:38.048
- You don't like it?
- No, no, no!

58:38.115 --> 58:39.316
Then you're excused.

58:39.383 --> 58:41.552
Short stuff!

58:45.255 --> 58:46.657
We're almost there.

58:48.659 --> 58:50.127
And I'm almost back to normal.

58:53.430 --> 58:55.600
It was nice while it lasted.

58:55.666 --> 58:57.534
- Tuffy!
- My queen!

58:57.602 --> 58:59.704
Jerry!

58:59.770 --> 59:02.072
The Nome King
has the ruby slippers.

59:02.139 --> 59:05.309
And he'll use their magic to sink
the Emerald City beneath Oz.

59:05.375 --> 59:07.978
How horrible!
We must get inside quickly.

59:08.045 --> 59:09.279
I have an idea.

59:09.346 --> 59:12.182
Remember that Cyclonotron
thing back at your farm?

59:12.249 --> 59:14.719
Well, I think we can improve
on its design.

59:14.785 --> 59:15.953
I've got the parts.

59:16.020 --> 59:18.555
Now, if we can get tools
and mousepower…

59:19.523 --> 59:20.691
Oh, great.

59:20.758 --> 59:22.426
Now let's put
that arm over there.

59:22.492 --> 59:23.861
And attach that leg here.

59:23.928 --> 59:25.495
And the other leg,
I'd like to put right here.

59:25.562 --> 59:27.798
And my head exactly right there.

59:29.433 --> 59:30.901
Whoa, ziggy!

59:33.503 --> 59:39.176
Now, at last, the emeralds of Emerald
City will be back where they belong.

59:39.243 --> 59:42.780
Oh, I got a sinkin'
feelin' about this.

59:42.847 --> 59:45.950
There's no place like Nome.

59:46.016 --> 59:48.452
There's no place like Nome!

59:48.518 --> 59:51.789
There's no place like Nome!

59:52.790 --> 59:54.191
Going down!

59:57.728 --> 01:00:00.230
Oh, no! The city is sinking!

01:00:02.867 --> 01:00:04.601

- Where are we?
- Ah, Nome sweet Nome.

01:01:15.305 --> 01:01:17.041
I know how disappointed
you must be

01:01:17.107 --> 01:01:19.744
to not stop
at the big bad Nome King.

01:01:19.810 --> 01:01:22.747
Boo-hoo. Sniff sniff it all…

01:01:22.813 --> 01:01:24.982
Ah, cue the sad music.

01:01:25.049 --> 01:01:28.753
Oh, cheer up. I have a big
job for a little lady.

01:01:28.819 --> 01:01:30.721
And I hope you're up to the task

01:01:30.788 --> 01:01:34.358
because you're going to spend the
rest of your life digging up jewels

01:01:34.424 --> 01:01:35.926
for me.

01:01:35.993 --> 01:01:38.095
Oh, really? And if I refuse?

01:01:39.897 --> 01:01:43.100
Then it's into the Pit
of Nome Return.

01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:49.039
See, I call it that, as
no nome has returned from it.

01:01:49.106 --> 01:01:51.175
Hmm, as a matter of fact,

01:01:51.241 --> 01:01:56.713
the longer I keep you two around, the more
I'm convinced you'll stir up trouble.

01:01:56.781 --> 01:01:58.348
Toss them in.

01:02:00.717 --> 01:02:02.719
Well?

01:02:02.787 --> 01:02:05.189
We're fine with causing
general mayhem,

01:02:05.255 --> 01:02:08.258
as outlined in the
Nome Guard job description.

01:02:08.325 --> 01:02:12.229
But when it actually comes down
to destroying living scarecrows

01:02:12.296 --> 01:02:13.730
and little girls,

01:02:13.798 --> 01:02:15.732
we're drawing the line.

01:02:17.467 --> 01:02:19.203
You are fired.

01:02:26.243 --> 01:02:29.679
He really doesn't mince words,
does he?

01:02:29.746 --> 01:02:31.715
- Come on!
- Seize them!

01:02:33.851 --> 01:02:36.120
Time to pull this all together.

01:02:37.721 --> 01:02:39.423
Good job.

01:02:39.489 --> 01:02:41.058
Jerry…

01:02:46.663 --> 01:02:48.432
You're canned, Nome King.

01:02:48.498 --> 01:02:51.301
You would need an army
to stop me.

01:02:51.368 --> 01:02:52.536
They've got one.

01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:56.240
Come on, men. Let's go!

01:02:56.306 --> 01:02:58.142
You'll have to do
better than that.

01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:04.148
Huh?

01:03:15.926 --> 01:03:17.727
Oh! Toto! Tom!

01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:19.029
- Lion!
- Lion?

01:03:19.096 --> 01:03:20.264
Alive and in person,

01:03:20.330 --> 01:03:21.999
accompanied by Tom the Terrible,

01:03:22.066 --> 01:03:23.200
and Toto the Terrific,

01:03:23.267 --> 01:03:24.869
masters of the animal kingdom.

01:03:24.935 --> 01:03:26.403
I'd like to thank
all the little people

01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:28.738
who made our appearance
down here possible.

01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:30.274
The moles, the gophers,

01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:33.577
especially the badgers,
great digging fellas.

01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:35.112
And don't forget me!

01:03:35.179 --> 01:03:38.582
Old fraidy cat promised me
all the nomes I could eat.

01:03:38.648 --> 01:03:40.817
Ooh la la.

01:03:40.885 --> 01:03:43.120
What's your hurry, delicious?

01:03:43.187 --> 01:03:46.790
Oh! Food to go! Love it!

01:03:46.857 --> 01:03:50.627
It'll take more than some
mangy mammals to scare me.

01:03:50.694 --> 01:03:51.828
Right you are.

01:03:51.896 --> 01:03:54.098
We nearly forgot the air force.

01:04:03.473 --> 01:04:05.976
Eggs! Nomes hate eggs!

01:04:09.579 --> 01:04:11.515
Come back, you cowards!

01:04:11.581 --> 01:04:14.618
Come back!
All right, then go.

01:04:14.684 --> 01:04:16.586
I have all the power I need.

01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:31.435
Ha ha!

01:04:37.908 --> 01:04:39.743
Hey there Kansas,
what's a shaking?

01:04:39.809 --> 01:04:42.679
- Jitter bug.
- What's with the crazy, queasy quaking?

01:04:42.746 --> 01:04:43.880
We need your help!

01:04:43.948 --> 01:04:45.315
Sure thing, my country cutie.

01:04:45.382 --> 01:04:47.952
I'm yours to command,
all right-o-rooty.

01:04:55.625 --> 01:04:57.227
Come and get me, you beasts.

01:04:57.294 --> 01:04:59.429
The bigger the better.

01:05:01.665 --> 01:05:04.468
Uh-oh!

01:05:04.534 --> 01:05:05.635
Ha ha!

01:05:12.476 --> 01:05:15.612
You don't think anyone
can stand up to you?

01:05:15.679 --> 01:05:17.181
Ha! Like you?

01:05:17.247 --> 01:05:18.983
Well, yes! Like me!

01:05:19.049 --> 01:05:21.518
- Like all of us.
- Yeah.

01:05:23.887 --> 01:05:25.122
Three losers?

01:05:25.189 --> 01:05:27.791
A scruffy dog, and a cat
and a mouse.

01:05:27.857 --> 01:05:28.993
That's nothing.

01:05:29.059 --> 01:05:30.260
Well, they're my friends.

01:05:30.327 --> 01:05:32.096
And that's everything.

01:05:32.162 --> 01:05:35.932
Friends? You gave up the
only magic you'll ever have,

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.301
for them!

01:05:37.367 --> 01:05:42.139
Dorothy girl, you are a fool!

01:05:53.483 --> 01:05:55.185
Oh! Hold on!

01:05:56.453 --> 01:05:57.554
I'm ripping!

01:05:57.621 --> 01:06:00.357
That's terrible!

01:06:00.424 --> 01:06:03.427
Talk about grasping at straws.

01:06:03.493 --> 01:06:06.530
- Ruggedo, let them go!
- Of course.

01:06:06.596 --> 01:06:09.766
No reason they should
hang around any longer.

01:06:09.833 --> 01:06:11.335
Isn't that right, Scarecrow?

01:06:11.401 --> 01:06:14.538
- I'm slipping.
- Any last words,

01:06:14.604 --> 01:06:15.972
little girl?

01:06:19.043 --> 01:06:20.544
Let's dance!

01:06:26.583 --> 01:06:29.153
<i>♪ Swing those funky, ♪
♪ filthy feet ♪</i>

01:06:29.953 --> 01:06:32.122
What? Stop, stop!

01:06:32.189 --> 01:06:36.026
Whoa! Curse of Jitter Bug!

01:06:50.607 --> 01:06:52.008
Whoa!

01:06:56.246 --> 01:06:58.115
Swing it king,
now buck and wing.

01:06:58.182 --> 01:07:00.350
Now wrestle those pants
with a Russian dance.

01:07:00.417 --> 01:07:03.620
Hey! Hey! Hey!
You can't do this to me!

01:07:03.687 --> 01:07:07.057
You're right, Kingy. Dancing
alone ain't all that merry.

01:07:07.124 --> 01:07:09.526
You be partners, Tom and Jerry.

01:07:32.682 --> 01:07:36.853
- Miss Glinda.
- Your Highness, my eternal thanks.

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:38.388
You too, Tuffy.

01:07:56.940 --> 01:07:58.875
Pull me back!

01:07:58.942 --> 01:08:01.811
I said pull, you fools!

01:08:11.555 --> 01:08:14.023
Pull, you fool.

01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:17.161
C'mon, c'mon,
pull harder, harder!

01:08:21.365 --> 01:08:23.066
Well that was just awful.

01:08:23.133 --> 01:08:24.834
But at least he went dancing.

01:08:29.473 --> 01:08:32.676
Hey Kansas,
don't forget the boots, cutes.

01:08:39.783 --> 01:08:43.051
But their magic was strong
enough to sink the Emerald City.

01:08:43.118 --> 01:08:45.154
Then what was done,
can be undone.

01:08:45.221 --> 01:08:46.555
If you wish.

01:08:47.890 --> 01:08:49.426
I wish…

01:09:08.345 --> 01:09:10.714
- You did it, Dorothy.
- We knew you could.

01:09:11.615 --> 01:09:13.183
Mmm-hmm.

01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:15.319
Talk about your elevator shoes.

01:09:15.385 --> 01:09:18.154
And look who slept through
the whole thing.

01:09:24.294 --> 01:09:27.063
Hurry Butch, while she's asleep.

01:09:31.868 --> 01:09:35.671
I'm lucky, she swallowed me
in one gulp.

01:09:35.738 --> 01:09:37.874
Me, not so much.

01:09:41.578 --> 01:09:44.913
- Wow, Miss…
- Wizard!

01:09:44.981 --> 01:09:46.683
Why, we thought you was a goner.

01:09:46.750 --> 01:09:48.984
How did you drive away
the monkeys?

01:09:49.051 --> 01:09:50.886
Drive away? No, no, no.

01:09:50.953 --> 01:09:52.689
I tamed them. Yes.

01:09:52.756 --> 01:09:56.760
I remembered I had an assortment
of frutis gigantica seeds…

01:09:56.826 --> 01:10:00.797
I simply tossed some seeds from
the bottled labeled "Bananas",

01:10:00.864 --> 01:10:06.002
and presto, they were literally
eating out of my hand.

01:10:06.069 --> 01:10:09.239
You couldn't have returned
in a more auspicious moment.

01:10:09.306 --> 01:10:11.007
Yes.

01:10:11.074 --> 01:10:15.545
To capture the scoundrels
responsible for this catastrophe.

01:10:18.014 --> 01:10:19.583
Please, your wizardship.

01:10:19.649 --> 01:10:21.718
We were only following orders.

01:10:21.785 --> 01:10:25.221
And we were fired before
succumbing to true villainy.

01:10:25.289 --> 01:10:26.590
In that case,

01:10:26.656 --> 01:10:30.093
I think a wizardly pardon
can be arranged.

01:10:30.159 --> 01:10:33.430
And perhaps,
a change of occupation.

01:10:35.465 --> 01:10:39.002
Well, isn't this a horse
of a different color?

01:10:40.504 --> 01:10:42.472
Only on the outside.

01:10:48.978 --> 01:10:52.181
While I thank you for this
wonderful welcome,

01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:53.783
I want to assure you

01:10:53.850 --> 01:10:57.421
that the Scarecrow, Lion
and Tin Man,

01:10:57.487 --> 01:11:00.824
shall continue as ruling
triumvirate of Oz.

01:11:02.726 --> 01:11:05.495
Well, I humbly accept
the tenured position,

01:11:05.562 --> 01:11:08.097
of Wizard emeritus indilectus.

01:11:08.164 --> 01:11:10.199
Uh, with pay.

01:11:10.266 --> 01:11:11.935
But once again,

01:11:12.001 --> 01:11:16.440
the real heroes are Dorothy
and her friends from Kansas.

01:11:24.781 --> 01:11:26.883
Yes, and remember my dear,

01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:29.753
though some
may call you a child,

01:11:29.819 --> 01:11:32.956
your brave spirit is ageless.

01:11:33.022 --> 01:11:34.758
Thank you, sir.

01:11:34.824 --> 01:11:38.628
Um, Jerry, I think somebody
else wants to say goodbye.

01:11:38.695 --> 01:11:42.899
And I still owe you my thanks
for your heroism, Mr. Jerry.

01:11:51.508 --> 01:11:52.909
You're one of us now.

01:11:52.976 --> 01:11:55.612
A fearless fellow
feline forever.

01:11:55.679 --> 01:12:00.550
Lions and tigers
and cats, oh, yeah!

01:12:00.617 --> 01:12:03.052
Glinda, the ruby slippers…

01:12:03.119 --> 01:12:06.690
- Well, they don't belong to me.
- Oh, my dear,

01:12:06.756 --> 01:12:09.325
you think they might be
better off here in Oz.

01:12:09.393 --> 01:12:11.361
But because
of your heroic deeds,

01:12:11.428 --> 01:12:13.797
you've won the right
to keep them forever.

01:12:13.863 --> 01:12:16.666
Besides, you'll need them
to visit us.

01:12:16.733 --> 01:12:21.104
- Often, we hope.
- Oh, I will. I promise.

01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:24.173
There's just one more thing
I'd like to take with me.

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:26.275
Name it, my dear.

01:12:36.219 --> 01:12:38.888
Well, here we go again, I guess.

01:12:38.955 --> 01:12:41.024
Goodbye everyone.

01:12:41.090 --> 01:12:43.292
So long, Kansas.

01:12:43.359 --> 01:12:44.928
I'll see you, kiddo.

01:12:44.994 --> 01:12:46.162
Safe journeys.

01:12:46.229 --> 01:12:47.997
Hurry back, Dorothy.

01:12:50.166 --> 01:12:54.170
There's no place like home,
there's no place like home…

01:12:54.237 --> 01:12:56.372
There's no place like home…

01:12:59.242 --> 01:13:00.844
Take this.

01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:03.713
Mr. Bibb will be here
any second.

01:13:11.455 --> 01:13:14.591
- Good morning, Mr. Bibb.
- What's good about it?

01:13:14.658 --> 01:13:18.728
Last night, my barbecue stand was
wrecked by two furry hooligans.

01:13:18.795 --> 01:13:23.366
Two furry hooligans,
just about your size.

01:13:23.433 --> 01:13:24.901
Uh, Mr. Bibb,

01:13:24.968 --> 01:13:27.103
if we could replace
your melon crop,

01:13:27.170 --> 01:13:29.639
would you take it in return
for our animals?

01:13:29.706 --> 01:13:33.376
Sure. I'd sign off
on this court order right now.

01:13:33.443 --> 01:13:36.646
Except I know you all
don't raise watermelons.

01:13:38.782 --> 01:13:41.551
Well, we only needed
to raise one.

01:13:41.618 --> 01:13:43.720
It's amazing!

01:13:43.787 --> 01:13:47.791
- It's unbelievable.
- And it's all yours.

01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:59.803
You boys
better be careful with that.

01:14:14.918 --> 01:14:16.586
This is the pits.

01:14:20.690 --> 01:14:22.391
This is ironic!

01:14:25.962 --> 01:14:27.463
Poor Mr. Bibb.

01:14:27.531 --> 01:14:28.965
Oh, don't fret none.

01:14:29.032 --> 01:14:32.468
That ornery little butter ball
needs the exercise.

01:14:32.869 --> 01:14:33.903
Tractor?

01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:35.805
Thank goodness you made it home!

01:14:35.872 --> 01:14:37.674
It'll take more than
a little windstorm

01:14:37.741 --> 01:14:41.578
to keep this old heap
away from her farm. Oh!

01:14:41.645 --> 01:14:44.548
Nighty night, missy.

01:14:44.614 --> 01:14:45.915
Goodness!

01:14:45.982 --> 01:14:48.652
So, who's gonna
clean up this mess?

01:14:56.960 --> 01:15:00.129
Auntie Em, Uncle Henry,
wait 'til you hear!

01:15:00.196 --> 01:15:01.364
Not now, Dorothy.

01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:04.433
We've got bad news.
We couldn't get the loan,

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:06.269
and no one was hiring.

01:15:06.335 --> 01:15:09.005
So, we're gonna have to hand over
all the animals to Mr. Bibb.

01:15:09.072 --> 01:15:12.609
He was just here
and he gave me this.

01:15:12.676 --> 01:15:15.579
Ha! Appears Bibb
is dropping the suit.

01:15:15.645 --> 01:15:18.314
I sorta talked him into it.

01:15:18.381 --> 01:15:19.983
You did this?

01:15:20.049 --> 01:15:23.319
Hmm. Em, looks like our
little girl is all grown up.

01:15:23.386 --> 01:15:25.154
Hurray for Dorothy!

01:15:25.221 --> 01:15:28.424
Hurray for Dorothy.

01:15:28.491 --> 01:15:31.861
And now we can really rebuild our farm.

01:15:46.943 --> 01:15:49.613
Quickly too, before those boys
wreck it any worse.

01:15:59.756 --> 01:16:01.725
Some things never change
around here.

01:16:01.791 --> 01:16:03.893
Oh, and I hope they never will.

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:06.029
And we're together forever.

01:16:06.095 --> 01:16:08.531
It's like I always say,
