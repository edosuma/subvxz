- All right. We I.D. the vic?
- No.

05:05.510 --> 05:08.078
And by all appearances,
he wasn't carrying a wallet.

05:08.129 --> 05:10.080
Or wearing pants,
for that matter.

05:10.131 --> 05:11.248

some underwear
under that loincloth.

05:17.422 --> 05:19.540
Hawaiians call that a <i>Malo.</i>

05:19.608 --> 05:21.425
I call it an
invitation to chafing.

05:21.476 --> 05:23.894
All right, why's
he dressed like a <i>Koa?</i>

05:23.979 --> 05:26.881
Well, it's quite the mystery--
his tattoos are genuine,

05:26.948 --> 05:28.732
as are the articles
of clothing.

05:28.800 --> 05:31.969
Wormholes notwithstanding,
it's as if our Hawaiian warrior

05:32.020 --> 05:34.388
just appeared from
some other time period.

05:34.456 --> 05:35.890
Well, Max, time travel
doesn't exist.

05:35.957 --> 05:37.391
Well, quite the contrary,
Commander McGarrett.

05:37.459 --> 05:40.044
I can assure you
the theory is quite sound.

05:40.111 --> 05:42.196
In fact, there has been recent...
Okay, okay, Max, zip it.

05:42.280 --> 05:43.380
Please. Respectfully.

05:43.448 --> 05:44.598
For argument's sake,
let's just say that

05:44.666 --> 05:46.901
this guy did not own a
DeLorean. Let's also say

05:46.968 --> 05:49.703
he's from the 21st century,
30's, male.

05:49.788 --> 05:51.154
What else do we know?

05:51.206 --> 05:53.507
Well, there's bruising
around the neck and head area,

05:53.592 --> 05:55.075
which indicates
that he suffered

05:55.143 --> 05:56.677
blunt-force trauma.
However, it is

05:56.795 --> 05:58.078
the severing
of the carotid

05:58.146 --> 06:00.848
that led to his death-- which
leads me to this discovery.

06:08.990 --> 06:11.258
A shark's tooth?
Indeed.

06:11.326 --> 06:13.594
Let's assume
that a shark didn't roll up

06:13.662 --> 06:15.796
into the jungle
and kill this guy-- what did?

06:15.864 --> 06:17.014
Well, judging
from his appearance,

06:17.065 --> 06:19.083
and how he died,
I'd go with a <i>leiomano.</i>

06:19.150 --> 06:19.934
Yeah.

06:20.001 --> 06:21.485
A what?

it's a small paddle

sewn around the edges.

08:16.277 --> 08:18.378
He was supposed to be here today,
but never showed.

08:18.445 --> 08:20.780
It was strange,
'cause I saw his car

08:20.831 --> 08:22.899
in the parking lot--
I thought maybe

he was just taking
his time getting ready.

They're also armed.

08:40.150 --> 08:41.667

No way.

We're all history buffs,

08:43.520 --> 08:45.889
trying to preserve and
celebrate our culture.

08:45.973 --> 08:48.775
And the worst that
happens: dehydration...

08:48.842 --> 08:50.643
maybe a broken ankle.

08:50.694 --> 08:52.262
Well, not today.

Broken branches.

09:11.332 --> 09:12.615
Ground's been disturbed.

09:12.683 --> 09:15.468
Definitely some sort
of a struggle went down.

09:16.720 --> 09:19.839
I've got arterial blood spatter.

09:19.907 --> 09:22.475
Likely due to the strike
at the victim's neck.

09:22.542 --> 09:24.177
Okay, well, looks like we found

09:24.228 --> 09:26.229
our primary crime scene.

09:27.881 --> 09:30.049
Hey, I got something.

09:33.487 --> 09:35.221
What is it?

09:35.272 --> 09:37.674
Looks like a bone fragment
of some kind.

09:37.741 --> 09:39.192
There's tool markings.

09:40.727 --> 09:42.378
And a drilled hole.

09:42.446 --> 09:44.563
Our victim wasn't

09:44.615 --> 09:46.983
wearing anything
like this.

09:47.051 --> 09:49.919
Based on the crazing
and discoloration, I'd say

09:49.987 --> 09:51.654
it's at least
a hundred years old.

09:51.722 --> 09:55.341
What's that?
Appears to be a strand of hair.

09:55.409 --> 09:56.593
All right.

09:56.660 --> 09:58.194
Let's get this to Fong

09:58.262 --> 09:59.912
and see if he can run DNA.

10:00.931 --> 10:02.632
Hold this.

10:18.983 --> 10:20.450
Hey, Chin.

10:20.534 --> 10:21.534
Hey, Kono. What's up?

10:21.601 --> 10:23.386
We found the
primary crime scene.

10:23.454 --> 10:25.822
We ran a preliminary process,
and we found something.

10:25.906 --> 10:28.774
A fragment that doesn't match
anything the victim was wearing.

10:28.826 --> 10:30.443
Hmm. Okay, let's have a look.

10:30.494 --> 10:31.711
Okay, it's on its way.

10:31.778 --> 10:33.129
Could belong to our killer

10:33.213 --> 10:34.947
and broke off
during the struggle.

10:34.999 --> 10:36.549
Okay, we have any idea
what it is?

10:36.616 --> 10:39.535
Um... part of a larger
artifact of some kind.

10:39.603 --> 10:42.572
Oh. It's lucky for us
we know an expert.

10:42.640 --> 10:44.457
What are you talking
about? Gabby?

10:44.508 --> 10:47.060
What, you and Dr. Asano
on the outs or something?

10:47.127 --> 10:50.079
No, we're good. Why?
You sure?

10:50.147 --> 10:52.415
- Okay, well, that's a relief.
- Yeah, I'm sure.

10:52.483 --> 10:53.583
Why is that a relief?

10:53.651 --> 10:54.901
Well, 'cause
she makes you happy.

10:54.968 --> 10:56.653
And I like
to see you happy, brah.

10:56.720 --> 10:58.321
Aw...

10:58.405 --> 10:59.756
So you gonna ask her
about the fragment?

10:59.823 --> 11:01.674
Yeah, I'll ask her
about the fragment.

11:01.742 --> 11:04.327
All right, Kono and I will
go talk to the vic's wife,

11:04.411 --> 11:06.112
see what she knows.
All right, shoots.

11:07.498 --> 11:08.981
Danny, you ever need
any advice

11:09.033 --> 11:10.750
on relationships,
my door is always open.

11:10.818 --> 11:12.952
Oh, good, well, you go ahead
and keep that door closed,

11:13.003 --> 11:13.936
but thank you.

11:19.093 --> 11:20.993
<i>Mrs. Koruba,</i>
<i>can you think of anyone</i>

11:21.045 --> 11:22.795
<i>who might want</i>
<i>to hurt your husband?</i>

11:23.830 --> 11:25.765
No.

11:25.832 --> 11:26.849
Nobody.

11:26.934 --> 11:27.850
We're looking
into everyone

11:27.935 --> 11:29.786
who was
at the reenactment.

11:30.837 --> 11:34.307
He loved those events.

11:34.358 --> 11:37.527
He used to say the battles
were great stress relievers,

11:37.594 --> 11:39.662
if you can
believe that.

11:39.730 --> 11:42.848
Plus, being part of the living
history of the Island--

11:42.900 --> 11:46.953
it... meant a lot to him.

11:47.020 --> 11:48.454
What kind of work did he do?

11:48.522 --> 11:51.624
Brandon designed boats.

11:51.691 --> 11:53.676
He built the company
from the ground up.

11:55.195 --> 11:57.130
He was lucky--

11:57.197 --> 11:59.999
his job was
his passion.

12:00.050 --> 12:04.654
He loved being out on the water,
exploring the islands.

12:04.722 --> 12:07.323
Even after all these
years, he said

12:07.391 --> 12:10.660
he learned something new
every time he went out.

12:10.728 --> 12:12.812
I feel that same way, too.

12:12.879 --> 12:15.098
Then you would have liked
Brandon.

12:15.182 --> 12:16.833
He grew up here

12:16.900 --> 12:18.518
and he arrived
at a place in his life

12:18.569 --> 12:20.353
where he was proud
of his roots...

12:20.404 --> 12:24.073
proud of his connection
to this island.

12:24.158 --> 12:25.408
Well, you can see that.

12:25.492 --> 12:27.160
This is quite an impressive
collection of Hawaiian art.

12:27.227 --> 12:29.579
That's another one
of Brandon's passions.

12:29.663 --> 12:31.564
Each piece was
culturally significant

12:31.615 --> 12:33.082
to him.

12:33.167 --> 12:36.369
Maybe you can help us
identify something.

12:37.654 --> 12:39.589
We found it at
the crime scene.

12:39.673 --> 12:40.606
Do you recognize it?

12:40.674 --> 12:43.092
I'm sorry, I'm sure

12:43.177 --> 12:47.563
Brandon would have,
but... I don't.

12:49.433 --> 12:51.350
I'm sorry to just drop
in on you like this.

12:51.418 --> 12:54.370
Oh, that's okay,
I'm glad you did.

12:54.438 --> 12:56.038
Is there any chance

12:56.106 --> 12:57.707
that hair was found
on this fragment?

12:57.775 --> 13:00.026
Yes, actually, there was.

13:00.093 --> 13:00.943
How'd you know that?

13:01.028 --> 13:02.862
Follow me.

13:02.929 --> 13:06.065
So I'm sorry that Grace
was sick last weekend.

13:06.116 --> 13:07.266
Is she feeling
better?

13:07.317 --> 13:08.785
Yes, full recovery,
she's good.

13:08.869 --> 13:09.786
That's great.

13:09.870 --> 13:11.087
Thanks for asking.

13:11.155 --> 13:12.188
I was really
looking forward

13:12.256 --> 13:14.207
to you bringing her
by the museum.

13:14.274 --> 13:16.042
I was, too. We'll,
uh, we'll reschedule.

13:16.109 --> 13:17.193
Anytime.

13:17.261 --> 13:18.995
Okay, I'll call you,
we'll set it up.

13:19.079 --> 13:20.630
All right.

13:20.714 --> 13:22.999
It's called a <i>lei niho palaoa.</i>

13:23.083 --> 13:24.617
It's early 19th century.

13:24.668 --> 13:26.252
The hook is made from the tooth
of a sperm whale

13:26.303 --> 13:29.071
and it's suspended from numerous
thin braids of human hair.

13:29.139 --> 13:30.339
That would explain the hair.

13:30.424 --> 13:31.424
Yeah.

13:31.475 --> 13:32.809
High-ranking men or women
used to wear them

13:32.893 --> 13:33.810
as emblems
of status.

13:33.894 --> 13:35.294
They are
extremely rare.

13:35.345 --> 13:36.395
Okay, so how
would somebody

13:36.463 --> 13:37.796
get their hands on
something like this?

13:37.848 --> 13:40.149
Well, they come up for sale
every once in a while,

13:40.234 --> 13:42.568
but there aren't many
private collectors worldwide,

13:42.636 --> 13:44.520
though I think one of them lives
here on the Island.

13:44.605 --> 13:46.305
Really, well, could
we get his name?

13:46.373 --> 13:49.759
Absolutely,
give me one second.

13:50.944 --> 13:53.812
His name is Brandon Koruba.

13:53.864 --> 13:55.865
Oh, good.

13:55.949 --> 13:57.450
That bad news?
He's our victim.

13:57.501 --> 13:59.402
But he, uh, he wasn't wearing the
necklace when we found the body.

13:59.470 --> 14:01.320
All we found was the fragment.

14:01.371 --> 14:03.789
Maybe the killer knew it was
valuable, and so he took it.

14:03.841 --> 14:05.391
Tell me something, how much
could you get for something

14:05.459 --> 14:07.894
like this?
It's difficult to say,

14:07.961 --> 14:12.098
but the last one to sell
at auction went for $27,000.

14:12.165 --> 14:14.217
$27,000-- that, uh,
sounds like motive.

14:14.301 --> 14:15.952
Yeah, yeah,
it sounds like motive.

14:20.974 --> 14:22.808
So what was
that all about?

14:22.860 --> 14:24.427
What was what all about?

14:24.495 --> 14:26.579
Well, I know
Grace wasn't sick last weekend.

14:26.647 --> 14:28.064
Uh, yes, she was.

14:28.148 --> 14:29.282
You calling me a liar?

14:29.349 --> 14:30.266
Yeah.

14:30.334 --> 14:31.817
I mean, you do a
thing when you lie.

14:31.869 --> 14:34.153
- I do a thing. What thing do I do?
- You're doing it now.

14:34.221 --> 14:35.321
You mean sitting here
having a conversation--

14:35.372 --> 14:36.572
that thing?

14:36.657 --> 14:38.157
You're a squinter, you squint.
Oh,

14:38.208 --> 14:39.825
I'm a squinter?
Yeah.

14:39.877 --> 14:40.993
Okay, well,
if you haven't noticed,

14:41.044 --> 14:43.079
the sun is blasting me
in my face all the time.

14:43.163 --> 14:44.363
Okay.
See, where I come from,

14:44.414 --> 14:45.748
they got a break
from that sort of torture.

14:45.832 --> 14:47.250
They are called clouds, weather.
Oh.

14:47.317 --> 14:48.668
Here we don't have that
so much, you see.

14:48.719 --> 14:50.836
Right, see, now
you're avoiding.

14:50.888 --> 14:52.672
I'm not avoiding anything.

14:52.723 --> 14:54.457
I know Grace wasn't sick
last weekend

14:54.525 --> 14:57.276
because you guys went to the zoo.
Remember, you told me about the zoo.

14:57.344 --> 14:59.712
I'm just wondering why you lied.
You don't have to tell me if y--

14:59.763 --> 15:01.130
I'm just wondering; it's weird.
Okay, would you shut up,

15:01.198 --> 15:02.148
please, okay?

15:02.216 --> 15:03.966
It's not like
it was premeditated.

15:04.034 --> 15:05.217
I was put on the spot.

15:05.269 --> 15:06.885
I just want to make sure
that things are good

15:06.937 --> 15:08.887
between Gabby and I before
I introduce her to my daughter.

15:08.939 --> 15:10.790
Why don't you understand that?
That doesn't make sense to you?

15:10.857 --> 15:12.480
Yeah, I do understand. When's
that gonna be, when Grace is 30?

15:12.481 --> 15:13.984
You guys have been dating
for three months. Don't you

15:14.009 --> 15:15.209
think it's time they met?

15:15.512 --> 15:16.913
Three months is not a long time.

15:16.997 --> 15:18.781
Three months is like a
lifetime for a kid.

15:18.865 --> 15:20.733
Don't you want Grace to
know that you're happy?

15:20.784 --> 15:21.784
You're her daddy.

15:21.852 --> 15:23.970
Hey, I am happy.
You're never happy.

15:24.037 --> 15:25.655
I'm happy when I'm not around you.
That's a lie, too.

15:25.722 --> 15:27.456
You love me. Okay, you
know what I think it is?

15:27.541 --> 15:28.991
I think
this is less

15:29.059 --> 15:30.126
about you protecting Gracie

15:30.210 --> 15:31.494
and more about you
protecting yourself.

15:31.562 --> 15:32.678
Oh, right, I forgot,

15:32.746 --> 15:34.213
because you're an expert
on relationships.

15:34.264 --> 15:35.631
You're married with kids,
you know everything,

15:35.716 --> 15:37.750
so let me ask you
a question, genius:

15:37.818 --> 15:39.669
okay, what happens
when Grace gets attached

15:39.736 --> 15:41.971
and things don't work out
between me and Gabby, huh?

15:42.055 --> 15:44.023
Or what happens when things
do work out between Gabby and I

15:44.090 --> 15:45.024
and then Grace doesn't like her?

15:45.091 --> 15:46.642
Then what, then what do I do?

15:46.727 --> 15:48.594
Let me ask you a question: how
you gonna know if you don't try?

15:48.645 --> 15:50.763
What happens if you shut up
and let me run my own camp,

15:50.831 --> 15:51.948
and I'll introduce them when
I feel like it's the right time?

15:52.032 --> 15:53.399
How about that?

15:53.450 --> 15:54.141
Can you hold on for a
second, please?

15:54.166 --> 15:55.366
- Sure.
- Excuse me.

15:55.586 --> 15:57.503
Chin, hey, what's up?
So we checked into

15:57.571 --> 15:59.522
the background of
all the participants

15:59.590 --> 16:01.691
in the reenactment
and we got a hit with HPD.

16:01.758 --> 16:03.242
Seth Burgess.

16:03.293 --> 16:04.577
He was arrested four years ago

16:04.628 --> 16:06.445
for trafficking
stolen antiquities.

16:06.513 --> 16:07.946
Okay, so he's a smart perp.

16:07.998 --> 16:09.365
I mean, by doing
these battle reenactments,

16:09.433 --> 16:11.417
he puts himself in the world
of big-time collectors

16:11.468 --> 16:13.135
like Brandon Koruba.

16:13.220 --> 16:14.286
I checked with Mamo.

16:14.338 --> 16:16.121
He said that he saw Seth
before the reenactment,

16:16.173 --> 16:17.223
but he slipped out early.

16:17.290 --> 16:18.357
Okay.

16:18.425 --> 16:19.725
We get an address?

16:19.793 --> 16:20.959
I'm sending it over.

16:39.830 --> 16:43.949
Duke.
What are you doing here?

16:44.001 --> 16:45.818
Guy inside's been squatting.
What are you doing here?

16:45.869 --> 16:47.336
Well, the guy inside
is our murder suspect.

16:47.421 --> 16:48.738
His name is
Seth Burgess.

16:48.805 --> 16:50.489
Yeah? Well, we evicted him
a few times before,

16:50.540 --> 16:52.658
but this time
he's barricaded himself in.

16:52.709 --> 16:54.593
Anybody else in there with him?

16:54.661 --> 16:56.879
Not that we know of.
All right.

16:56.963 --> 16:58.631
We got a report
he might be armed.

16:58.682 --> 17:00.566
Okay.

17:00.634 --> 17:02.018
All right, we're going
to have to breach.

17:02.102 --> 17:04.353
I'm gonna go get
the TAC gear.

17:11.461 --> 17:12.728
What's he doing?

17:12.796 --> 17:15.330
Undoubtedly something insane.

17:16.650 --> 17:19.868
Might want to pull your
guys off the house.

17:19.953 --> 17:22.605
All units, move back
and away from the house.

17:22.673 --> 17:23.638
Move, move,
move, move!

17:23.707 --> 17:25.107
Back and away, move!

17:25.175 --> 17:28.477
Move! Just back up
but keep a perimeter.

17:44.394 --> 17:46.562
This is my house, yeah?

18:18.628 --> 18:20.529
All units, move in, move in.

18:20.597 --> 18:21.547
Suspect is out
of the house.

18:21.615 --> 18:22.531
Move in.

18:23.600 --> 18:24.767
Turn around and
face the house.

18:24.851 --> 18:26.969
Hands above
your head.

18:33.493 --> 18:34.877
Very subtle, buddy.

18:34.945 --> 18:37.246
I mean, who would have
thought-- tear gas grenade

18:37.314 --> 18:38.948
down the
skylight?

18:39.032 --> 18:41.117
Oh, yeah, yeah, you.

18:41.201 --> 18:43.619
It was either that or cook
one of your frittatas, Danny.

18:43.703 --> 18:44.770
You know what I mean?

18:47.457 --> 18:49.592
That's, that's good.

19:00.720 --> 19:03.522
Clear!

19:06.309 --> 19:08.310
Danny!

19:19.806 --> 19:20.856
Looks like I found our motive.

19:24.828 --> 19:26.962
I'll see your motive
and raise you a murder weapon.

19:35.660 --> 19:37.577
<i>- - Congratulations, Seth.</i>

19:37.645 --> 19:38.728
Your squatting
days are over.

19:38.780 --> 19:40.664
You got a bunk and
three squares a day

19:40.731 --> 19:42.516
courtesy of the taxpayers
of Hawaii.

19:42.583 --> 19:45.085
Did you really kill Brandon
Koruba so that you could

19:45.169 --> 19:46.720
take his necklace and
use it to pay your rent?

19:46.788 --> 19:48.422
You got it all wrong-- I
didn't kill him.

19:48.506 --> 19:50.740
Well, why was the murder
weapon in your house?

19:50.792 --> 19:52.909
We're processing it right now.
As soon as the prints

19:52.960 --> 19:54.127
and the DNA
come back,

19:54.212 --> 19:55.412
you will be charged with
Brandon Koruba's murder.

19:55.480 --> 19:57.914
Test it all you want.
I didn't kill him.

19:57.965 --> 19:59.249
We found Brandon's
necklace in your house

19:59.300 --> 20:00.734
with his blood
still on it.

20:01.919 --> 20:03.970
You know how that looks?

20:06.274 --> 20:09.943
Okay, look, I was on my way
to the reenactment

20:10.027 --> 20:11.194
and I heard a woman scream.

20:11.262 --> 20:12.696
I went to help,

20:12.763 --> 20:15.015
and that's when I found
Brandon lying in the woods,

20:15.082 --> 20:18.201
but he was already dead.

20:18.269 --> 20:20.387
I took the necklace.

20:20.455 --> 20:22.272
It was worth a fortune.

20:22.323 --> 20:23.457
All I could
think about

20:23.541 --> 20:25.125
was how much
I needed the money,

20:25.209 --> 20:27.744
and Brandon sure as hell
didn't need it anymore.

20:28.830 --> 20:32.549
Wow, you're
a sentimental guy.

20:32.616 --> 20:36.219
What I did was wrong,
but I didn't kill anybody.

20:36.287 --> 20:38.321
<i>Just got off the phone</i>
<i>with Fong.</i>

20:38.389 --> 20:39.789
Looks like the shark
tooth we pulled

20:39.841 --> 20:41.408
from the vic's wound
is the real deal.

20:41.476 --> 20:44.644
Problem is, the shark teeth on
Seth's <i>leiomano</i> are plastic.

20:44.712 --> 20:46.146
Meaning it can't be
the murder weapon.

20:46.230 --> 20:48.448
Yes, also meaning
that Seth probably is

20:48.516 --> 20:50.650
just an opportunistic dumb ass,
after all.

20:50.735 --> 20:53.253
Okay, maybe Koruba wasn't
killed over this necklace.

20:53.321 --> 20:55.555
We need to dig into Koruba's
life-- business and personal.

20:55.590 --> 20:56.790
What do we got so far?

20:56.858 --> 20:58.108
All right, well,
Koruba ran a company--

20:58.159 --> 20:59.976
Pacific Shipyards. They design
and built cutters--

21:00.027 --> 21:01.761
high-end yachts.

21:01.829 --> 21:03.646
According to his financials...

21:05.066 --> 21:06.917
...the guy was loaded.

21:06.984 --> 21:08.554
Hey, I just checked
Koruba's phone records.

21:08.555 --> 21:10.535
He got a call from his company
right around TOD.

21:10.560 --> 21:11.760
Who was he talking to?

21:12.039 --> 21:15.609
Call came from his business
partner's line-- Tony Dennison.

21:15.676 --> 21:17.660
- How long did they talk for?
- Little over 12 minutes.

21:17.712 --> 21:19.179
So, wait a minute,
he was talking business when he

21:19.247 --> 21:21.114
should have been participating
in the reenactment?

21:21.182 --> 21:22.665
Yeah, his wife said
he loved those events,

21:22.717 --> 21:23.984
so whatever the call
was about, it must

21:24.051 --> 21:25.185
have been important
for him to take it.

21:25.269 --> 21:26.319
Yeah, and it
might have had

21:26.387 --> 21:27.687
something to do
with his murder.

21:31.842 --> 21:34.611
<i>What's this I hear</i>
<i>about you inviting people</i>

21:34.678 --> 21:37.113
to the Hilton on Friday night?
You sound surprised.

21:37.181 --> 21:40.133
Well, when I heard that you, uh,
you offered to pay the tab,

21:40.201 --> 21:41.785
yeah, I was, I was surprised.

21:41.852 --> 21:43.620
Ah, well, you heard right.

21:43.687 --> 21:46.522
Okay, you gonna conveniently
forget your wallet

21:46.574 --> 21:47.991
on Friday night?
No, that is your move.

21:48.042 --> 21:49.459
That is my move,
you're right.

21:49.526 --> 21:50.460
So what's
the occasion?

21:50.527 --> 21:52.329
No occasion.

21:52.380 --> 21:53.630
No occasion?
No.

21:53.697 --> 21:55.715
- Oh, okay, who's going?
- Do you need a guest list

21:55.800 --> 21:58.151
before you decide to come?
I just want to know who's going.

21:58.219 --> 21:59.636
Friends. Friends are going.
Oh, good.

21:59.703 --> 22:01.488
All right, good.
What's the deal?

22:01.556 --> 22:03.223
There's no deal.
What, there's got to be a deal

22:03.307 --> 22:04.540
because I invite my friends
to dinner?

22:04.592 --> 22:05.825
You never invite
your friends anywhere.

22:05.893 --> 22:08.311
Incorrect. I just did.

22:08.379 --> 22:10.713
Okay.

22:10.765 --> 22:12.649
Is Gabby going?

22:12.716 --> 22:14.884
Okay, now you're making
a deal out of it.

22:14.936 --> 22:16.319
You're doing it. Stop!

22:16.387 --> 22:18.405
All right, just show up
to dinner, please.

22:18.489 --> 22:20.357
- I would love to come to dinner.
- Thank you.

22:27.031 --> 22:29.332
<i>It was just</i>
<i>an ordinary phone call.</i>

22:29.400 --> 22:32.102
We talked about boat specs, uh,

22:32.169 --> 22:34.371
concept delivery estimates.

22:34.422 --> 22:36.590
- We needed to nail down a few dates.
- Okay.

22:36.674 --> 22:37.924
Did he sound stressed?

22:38.009 --> 22:39.626
Nah, he was in a good mood.

22:39.710 --> 22:41.928
Battle reenactments always
put Brandon in a good mood.

22:42.013 --> 22:44.497
He said the war cries
were cathartic.

22:44.565 --> 22:46.016
Makes sense to me.

22:46.083 --> 22:49.669
He invited me to go along,
but it really wasn't my thing.

22:49.737 --> 22:51.354
How long were you
guys partners?

22:51.422 --> 22:53.256
15 years.

22:53.307 --> 22:55.275
We built nearly 100 vessels
together.

22:55.343 --> 22:57.611
Long time.

22:59.146 --> 23:01.398
What's this
all about?

23:01.449 --> 23:04.618
Environmental activists.

23:04.702 --> 23:07.153
We're a frequent target
'cause of the work we do.

23:07.238 --> 23:08.622
Boats are like cars.

23:08.706 --> 23:10.724
There's fuel and oil pollution
you just can't avoid.

23:10.791 --> 23:12.492
This is from a group
that calls itself

23:12.576 --> 23:13.793
Urthstrike.

23:13.878 --> 23:16.129
You know, we try to minimize
our carbon footprint,

23:16.213 --> 23:17.781
be eco-friendly, but

23:17.848 --> 23:19.949
short of going out of business,
you can't please everyone.

23:20.001 --> 23:21.951
These guys hit you often?
At least once a month.

23:22.003 --> 23:24.387
We upped our security,
added a few night guards,

23:24.455 --> 23:26.456
but they still manage to
get their point across.

23:26.507 --> 23:29.459
But up until now,
it's just been vandalism.

23:29.510 --> 23:31.061
You ever call the cops?

23:31.128 --> 23:32.345
They can't find these guys.

23:32.430 --> 23:33.913
They're too good
at covering their tracks.

23:33.981 --> 23:36.583
These guys ever threaten
you or Brandon personally?

23:36.651 --> 23:39.285
I'll show you.

23:40.905 --> 23:44.557
<i>Brandon Koruba,</i>

23:44.625 --> 23:46.576
you'd have us believe

23:46.643 --> 23:48.778
that you're a friend
to the environment.

23:48.846 --> 23:52.599
Truth is, you're nothing more
than a fraud.

23:52.667 --> 23:54.100
You've turned a blind eye

23:54.168 --> 23:56.486
while your company looks
to profit off the death

23:56.537 --> 23:58.154
of endangered marine life.

23:58.205 --> 23:59.539
Might mean little to you--

23:59.607 --> 24:01.925
nothing more than casualties
along the way of making a buck.

24:01.992 --> 24:04.678
But here's the deal, Brandon.

24:04.762 --> 24:07.464
You build this new
machine of death,

24:07.515 --> 24:11.201
and I'll make sure
you're casualty number one.

24:11.268 --> 24:14.337
Hell, I'll see
to it personally.

24:14.388 --> 24:16.523
Why doesn't he tell us
how he really feels?

24:16.607 --> 24:18.975
Yeah, the man on the screen
is Urthstrike's big gun.

24:19.026 --> 24:20.777
By the sound of it,
he's made the fight

24:20.844 --> 24:22.445
against Koruba's
company pretty personal.

24:22.513 --> 24:24.230
Does this big gun got a name?

24:24.315 --> 24:26.516
- I'm still working on that.
- Despite his group's heavy

24:26.567 --> 24:28.118
online presence,
he's done a pretty good job

24:28.185 --> 24:29.786
of keeping his identity
under wraps.

24:29.854 --> 24:31.020
Koruba's wife
never mentioned

24:31.072 --> 24:32.238
any threats.
No. Dennison said

24:32.323 --> 24:34.524
he kept them from her,
he didn't want her to worry.

24:34.575 --> 24:36.910
Okay, so, what's this machine
of death he's talking about?

24:36.994 --> 24:38.194
That is Pacific

24:38.245 --> 24:40.563
Shipyards' new interisland
transport carrier.

24:40.631 --> 24:42.549
It goes into production
later this month.

24:42.633 --> 24:44.250
Promises to ferry
a couple hundred people

24:44.335 --> 24:45.701
from various ports
around the islands.

24:45.753 --> 24:47.721
Urthstrike says
that the traffic will hurt

24:47.805 --> 24:49.989
Hawaii's humpback
and monk seal populations,

24:50.057 --> 24:51.124
animals already on the
endangered list.

24:51.149 --> 24:52.349
Okay, wait.

24:52.676 --> 24:54.010
This guy kills Koruba
over monk seals?

24:54.078 --> 24:56.012
He makes it pretty
clear on the video.

24:56.063 --> 24:57.764
Yeah, wait. We're not actually
considering Urthstrike

24:57.848 --> 24:59.265
as a viable suspect, are we?

24:59.350 --> 25:01.034
What are you saying?

25:01.102 --> 25:02.402
Well, they're
environmentalists.

25:02.486 --> 25:04.720
I mean, they fight to preserve
island life, not destroy it.

25:04.772 --> 25:06.039
Yeah, but how far

25:06.107 --> 25:07.373
are they willing to go
to protect their home?

25:07.441 --> 25:09.442
This guy, whoever he is--
him and his crew--

25:09.527 --> 25:10.910
they're anarchists.
They're dangerous.

25:10.995 --> 25:13.279
Okay, well, he might be guilty
of being a zealot,

25:13.364 --> 25:15.632
but murdering Koruba
in cold blood-- I don't see it.

25:15.699 --> 25:17.200
You're defending these people?

25:17.251 --> 25:19.536
Boss, I-I know
people like this.

25:19.587 --> 25:21.337
I grew up with them.

25:21.405 --> 25:24.374
They may break the law,
abuse a can of spray paint

25:24.425 --> 25:26.046
and tag the hull of a boat,
but they're not killers.

25:26.071 --> 25:27.127
Yeah. Not unless they

25:27.128 --> 25:29.763
don't get what they want.
Kono, they've made several

25:29.847 --> 25:31.798
threatening videos like this,
all targeting Brandon Koruba.

25:31.882 --> 25:33.099
That makes him a suspect.

25:33.217 --> 25:36.519
Okay, all right,
so then tell me this.

25:36.587 --> 25:38.521
How's a guy who has
more Twitter followers

25:38.589 --> 25:40.306
than Justin
Bieber a ghost?

25:40.391 --> 25:42.609
He's careful. Look.

25:42.693 --> 25:43.960
In all of his videos,

25:44.028 --> 25:46.012
he wears a mask.

25:47.281 --> 25:49.215
Hold on.

25:49.283 --> 25:50.784
He's not that careful.
Go back.

25:52.269 --> 25:54.704
Stop.

25:54.771 --> 25:56.439
- He touched the lens with his thumb.
- Put it in.

25:56.490 --> 25:58.107
Could be a viable print.

26:11.489 --> 26:13.573
Huh?
Bingo.

26:13.641 --> 26:15.875
Kevin Creed.
He's got a couple

26:15.943 --> 26:17.894
of misdemeanors, and
an address in Kailua.

26:27.121 --> 26:27.954
Stop right there!

26:28.022 --> 26:29.689
Don't move! Freeze!

26:29.773 --> 26:31.608
Everybody, put your hands
behind your heads.

26:31.659 --> 26:35.195
interlock your fingers,
turn and face the back wall.

26:35.279 --> 26:38.648
You understand? Hey, you,
stop right now.

26:38.699 --> 26:41.301
Hands behind your head.
Step forward.

26:41.368 --> 26:42.535
Who are you?

26:42.603 --> 26:44.120
I'm a pacifist.

26:44.171 --> 26:46.739
Really? What's your name?

26:46.807 --> 26:47.740
Allison.

26:47.808 --> 26:49.125
Rest of the house is clear.

26:49.176 --> 26:50.894
Where's Creed?

26:50.961 --> 26:53.429
Hey, it's not a difficult
question. Go ahead.

26:53.497 --> 26:54.898
Tell her.
Where's Creed?

26:54.965 --> 26:56.549
Huh?

26:58.018 --> 26:59.452
Hey!

27:26.579 --> 27:28.330
Kono, listen to me.
He's heading for Sand Island.

27:28.398 --> 27:30.532
Take Libby and
cut him off.

27:30.600 --> 27:32.551
Copy that.

27:52.505 --> 27:53.605
Water!

27:53.673 --> 27:56.342
I see it.

27:56.409 --> 27:57.876
That's not the answer
I was looking for.

28:14.110 --> 28:17.112
This is great.

28:17.197 --> 28:19.398
You just drowned
our only suspect.

28:22.402 --> 28:24.737
Help me!

28:24.788 --> 28:26.772
Please help me!
Could you hold this, please?

29:01.124 --> 29:03.692
Come on. Come on.
On the ground!

29:03.760 --> 29:04.860
On the ground.

29:04.944 --> 29:06.144
Give me your other hand.

29:06.196 --> 29:07.579
Right now.
Fingers together.

29:07.647 --> 29:09.615
Stay down.

29:13.253 --> 29:14.670
I thought you couldn't swim.

29:14.738 --> 29:17.322
Yeah, well, now you know.

29:20.610 --> 29:21.877
Book 'em, Danno.

29:21.945 --> 29:24.329
Why don't you go
book me a towel?

29:29.185 --> 29:31.353
You know, it's not
the smartest move,

29:31.438 --> 29:33.472
posting threatening
videos online.

29:33.523 --> 29:35.691
I mean, you basically Tweeted
a murder confession.

29:35.759 --> 29:38.727
We also found surveillance
tapes in the beach house.

29:38.812 --> 29:41.430
We know you were stalking
Brandon Koruba.

29:41.498 --> 29:43.115
You were just waiting
for the right opportunity

29:43.183 --> 29:45.617
to kill him, right?

29:45.685 --> 29:48.036
I never said
I would <i>kill</i> Brandon.

29:48.121 --> 29:50.289
Oh, right, right,
all you said was,

29:50.356 --> 29:53.592
you would personally see to
it he was casualty number one.

29:53.660 --> 29:56.829
Yes. Casualty as in death
of his business, not his life.

29:56.880 --> 29:58.797
You really think
a jury's going to believe that?

29:58.865 --> 30:00.365
I don't care what they believe.

30:00.417 --> 30:02.334
I didn't kill Brandon Koruba.

30:02.385 --> 30:04.753
Yeah, I hated everything
he stood for.

30:04.821 --> 30:06.755
And everybody knew it.
Okay.

30:06.823 --> 30:10.442
Brandon portrayed himself
as some island patriot,

30:10.510 --> 30:12.244
but the truth is, he was a liar.

30:12.312 --> 30:14.146
A hypocrite.
He didn't

30:14.213 --> 30:16.148
care about the
environment, never did.

30:16.215 --> 30:17.649
It was all a marketing tool,

30:17.717 --> 30:21.153
so he could sell yachts
and fatten his bank account.

30:21.221 --> 30:22.855
And you were the
one to stop him.

30:22.906 --> 30:24.356
Somebody needed to.
I drew the line

30:24.407 --> 30:27.359
when he was going to build
a boat that would butcher

30:27.410 --> 30:30.162
animals on the endangered
list. That should matter.

30:30.230 --> 30:32.197
Matter so much,
it was worth killing him over?

30:32.248 --> 30:33.165
Are you deaf?

30:33.232 --> 30:36.118
I... didn't kill him.

30:37.587 --> 30:39.788
But...

30:39.856 --> 30:42.624
I'd like to shake the hand
of the person who did.

30:45.578 --> 30:47.579
Hey, boss, can I see you
for a moment?

30:51.184 --> 30:52.935
Creed's lawyer is upstairs.

30:53.019 --> 30:54.770
He says we have the wrong guy.

30:54.854 --> 30:56.421
An attorney who thinks
his client's innocent.

30:56.473 --> 30:57.639
That's a first.

30:57.724 --> 30:59.758
Yeah, I know,
but he's not going anywhere

30:59.809 --> 31:01.276
until we release Creed.

31:01.344 --> 31:02.444
Where is he?

31:02.529 --> 31:05.397
In your office.

31:05.448 --> 31:07.032
Kevin Creed was
on the Big Island

31:07.099 --> 31:08.183
when Brandon Koruba
was murdered,

31:08.251 --> 31:11.470
so I insist you
release him right now.

31:11.538 --> 31:13.989
Yeah, I bet you have witnesses
who can attest to that, too.

31:14.057 --> 31:17.493
Yes. <i>I</i> was with him.

31:17.560 --> 31:20.128
It's convenient, isn't it?

31:20.213 --> 31:21.830
You know, we dug
into Creed's financials.

31:21.898 --> 31:23.765
He's not exactly a man
who can afford

31:23.833 --> 31:25.250
a beach house on Diamond Head.

31:25.301 --> 31:26.418
But you know what?

31:26.469 --> 31:27.586
I bet you could.

31:27.637 --> 31:28.804
Well, let's just say

31:28.888 --> 31:30.589
that Kevin Creed
has some very influential people

31:30.640 --> 31:32.040
invested in what

31:32.108 --> 31:33.291
he and Urthstrike are doing.

31:33.343 --> 31:34.893
Okay, let me
tell you something.

31:34.961 --> 31:37.012
I don't care
who his friends are,

31:37.096 --> 31:39.848
I don't care how powerful
his connections are.

31:39.916 --> 31:42.100
Murder charges
aside, we got him

31:42.151 --> 31:43.936
on reckless endangerment
and evading arrest.

31:43.987 --> 31:46.939
You can hold him on as many
charges as you want, Commander,

31:46.990 --> 31:49.441
but you are barking up
the wrong tree.

31:49.492 --> 31:51.944
I don't think
I am, Counselor. We know

31:52.011 --> 31:53.612
for a fact
that your client wanted

31:53.663 --> 31:56.281
to derail Koruba's
interisland ferry at any cost.

31:56.332 --> 31:58.450
My client didn't need
to derail the ferry.

31:58.501 --> 32:00.335
Koruba did that for him.

32:00.420 --> 32:01.169
Excuse me?

32:01.254 --> 32:02.487
According to my sources,

32:02.539 --> 32:04.373
Koruba let the permits lapse
two days ago.

32:04.440 --> 32:07.426
The interisland ferry
wasn't happening.

32:07.493 --> 32:09.378
Why?

32:09.445 --> 32:11.930
I heard
he had a change of heart.

32:11.998 --> 32:13.715
Realized
the environmental impact

32:13.800 --> 32:15.267
and pulled the plug.

32:15.334 --> 32:17.519
You see, Kevin Creed

32:17.604 --> 32:18.937
won that battle.

32:19.005 --> 32:22.140
So you tell me-- why would he
want to hurt Koruba?

32:25.061 --> 32:27.178
Right.

32:27.230 --> 32:28.346
Now, if you'll excuse me,

32:28.398 --> 32:30.632
I'd like to see my client.

32:32.585 --> 32:34.086
Thanks.

32:34.153 --> 32:36.805
Hey, so, Creed's
alibi checked out.

32:36.873 --> 32:38.690
There's video
of Creed leaving

32:38.741 --> 32:40.576
the Kona Marina
on the Big Island at TOD.

32:40.643 --> 32:42.444
So his lawyer
was telling the truth.

32:42.512 --> 32:43.779
Yeah, but this is
what I don't get.

32:43.846 --> 32:46.031
So, Pacific Shipyards stood
to net $100 million

32:46.082 --> 32:48.584
from the interisland ferry
project. Why throw that away?

32:48.668 --> 32:50.168
I don't know. Maybe
Urthstrike finally got to him,

32:50.219 --> 32:51.937
scared him into believing
what he was doing was wrong.

32:52.005 --> 32:53.755
Yeah, or maybe
there was another reason.

32:53.840 --> 32:57.092
Okay, well, if anybody knows,
it's Koruba's business partner.

32:57.176 --> 32:59.210
Right. Kono, head to the
Department of Transportation,

32:59.262 --> 33:01.263
find out what you can
about those permits.

33:01.347 --> 33:02.681
Danny and I will head down,
talk to Dennison,

33:02.732 --> 33:04.052
find out why Koruba
changed his mind.

33:04.077 --> 33:04.600
Copy.

33:04.601 --> 33:05.634
Hey, hey, hey.

33:05.702 --> 33:07.185
Yeah?

33:07.236 --> 33:09.054
You, uh, you're coming
Friday night, right?

33:09.105 --> 33:10.822
Yeah, the Hilton, 7:00.
Mm-hmm.

33:10.890 --> 33:12.157
Told you I'd be there the
first time you asked me.

33:12.224 --> 33:14.209
Just, uh, don't forget
your wallet.

33:23.753 --> 33:25.270
Mrs. Koruba?

33:26.456 --> 33:27.956
Officer Kalakaua.

33:28.024 --> 33:30.642
I heard on the news that
you had somebody in custody.

33:30.710 --> 33:33.078
I had to come here.

33:33.129 --> 33:34.579
I need to know.

33:34.631 --> 33:35.747
Who is it?

33:35.798 --> 33:37.916
It looks like the person
we have in custody

33:37.967 --> 33:39.584
didn't kill your husband.

33:41.437 --> 33:44.139
Are you any closer to
finding out who did?

33:44.207 --> 33:45.273
We're still looking.

33:47.810 --> 33:51.480
There is something that you
might be able to help us with.

33:51.564 --> 33:54.232
Did Brandon ever say why he
shut down the interisland ferry?

33:54.283 --> 33:56.434
I didn't know about that.

33:56.486 --> 33:57.936
We heard he pulled
the permits.

33:57.987 --> 33:59.821
He never mentioned
any of this to you?

33:59.906 --> 34:03.492
No, I had no idea.

34:03.576 --> 34:05.844
Do you think that's
why he was murdered?

34:05.912 --> 34:07.445
It's possible.

34:07.497 --> 34:08.797
But we're not sure.

34:18.524 --> 34:19.951
The rudder-- have it drop down
another two and a half feet.

34:19.976 --> 34:21.275
Yes, right there.

34:21.360 --> 34:23.210
Excuse me.
Excuse me, ma'am.

34:23.279 --> 34:24.713
Steve McGarrett,
Five-O.

34:24.781 --> 34:26.348
We're looking for
Tony Dennison.

34:26.399 --> 34:27.983
I'm sorry, he
just stepped out.

34:28.067 --> 34:29.717
You know where he went?
I don't know.

34:29.786 --> 34:30.969
He got an
urgent call.

34:31.020 --> 34:31.969
Urgent call from whom?

34:32.038 --> 34:32.938
Mrs. Koruba.

34:32.989 --> 34:33.938
Mrs. Koruba.

34:33.989 --> 34:35.139
How long ago was this?

34:35.190 --> 34:37.475
15 minutes ago.

34:37.527 --> 34:38.409
Okay, thank you.

34:40.129 --> 34:42.447
Why would Tony Dennison be
going to see Megan Koruba?

34:43.699 --> 34:45.117
I don't know,
maybe they're commiserating.

34:45.168 --> 34:47.219
They just lost somebody
they both were close to.

34:47.286 --> 34:49.438
Yeah, maybe. Kono,
what do you got?

34:49.505 --> 34:51.456
All right,
so I just left the D.O.T.

34:51.524 --> 34:52.924
Looks like the lawyer was right.

34:52.992 --> 34:54.443
Koruba did let
the permits lapse.

34:54.510 --> 34:55.827
Did you find out why?

34:55.878 --> 34:57.229
Well, according to the D.O.T.,

34:57.296 --> 34:58.496
Koruba felt
he couldn't move forward

34:58.548 --> 34:59.748
knowing what the costs were
to the environment.

34:59.816 --> 35:02.167
Okay, so he finally
had a change of heart.

35:02.218 --> 35:04.219
Well, it makes sense, knowing
what we know about Koruba

35:04.303 --> 35:05.503
and his connection
to the island.

35:05.555 --> 35:07.789
But get this,
a request to renew the permits

35:07.857 --> 35:10.341
was filed a few hours
after Koruba was murdered.

35:10.393 --> 35:12.310
By whom?

35:12.361 --> 35:14.596
Koruba's business partner,
Tony Dennison.

35:14.664 --> 35:16.098
There's our motive.

35:16.165 --> 35:17.816
Dennison stood to lose the most

35:17.867 --> 35:20.018
if Koruba killed
the deal on the boat.

35:20.069 --> 35:22.020
Yeah, and with him dead,
he had the most to gain.

35:22.071 --> 35:23.939
Maybe Dennison
killed his own partner

35:24.006 --> 35:25.657
just to keep the interisland
ferry project alive.

35:25.708 --> 35:26.992
Kono, listen to me.

35:27.043 --> 35:28.527
See if you can get
a lock on Dennison's cell.

35:28.594 --> 35:29.745
We just spoke to
his assistant,

35:29.829 --> 35:31.963
who implied that he was
off to see Megan Koruba.

35:32.031 --> 35:32.964
That's strange.

35:33.032 --> 35:34.416
I just saw Mrs. Koruba earlier.

35:34.500 --> 35:36.435
You didn't by any chance

35:36.502 --> 35:38.286
tell her anything
about this case, did you?

35:38.354 --> 35:40.605
I just asked her about Brandon
letting the permits lapse,

35:40.673 --> 35:42.424
but she said she didn't know
anything about it.

35:42.508 --> 35:43.792
Hold on, hold on.
Why would you do that?

35:43.860 --> 35:45.627
Well, she wasn't a suspect. Why?

35:45.695 --> 35:46.962
Maybe she was lying,
I don't know.

35:47.029 --> 35:47.963
We'll call you back.

35:48.030 --> 35:49.264
Okay, okay, okay.

35:49.348 --> 35:50.799
Are you thinking
what I am thinking?

35:50.867 --> 35:52.184
Yeah, if you're thinking
that Megan realized

35:52.235 --> 35:54.385
that we were on to Dennison,
and she tipped him off

35:54.437 --> 35:56.638
that we were coming
to see him today, yeah.

35:56.706 --> 35:58.323
Dennison and Koruba's wife
were in on this together.

35:58.390 --> 35:59.390
That is what I'm thinking.

36:09.578 --> 36:11.579
Kono, did you get a lock
on Dennison's phone?

36:11.630 --> 36:12.914
I'm pulling up a trace now.

36:12.965 --> 36:14.199
If Koruba's wife

36:14.266 --> 36:16.000
tipped off Dennison to the fact
that we're onto them,

36:16.085 --> 36:17.285
I guarantee you
they're on the run now.

36:17.336 --> 36:18.786
Kono, have the Coast Guard,

36:18.838 --> 36:20.205
Sheriffs and TSA on alert,

36:20.272 --> 36:22.674
and check and see if any airline
tickets have been purchased

36:22.741 --> 36:23.725
under either of their names.

36:23.792 --> 36:25.477
I followed up on
Dennison's alibi.

36:25.561 --> 36:27.378
Turns out, the call
we thought he made

36:27.446 --> 36:30.215
from his office to Koruba
around T.O.D. was actually

36:30.282 --> 36:32.183
patched through his
office to his cell phone.

36:32.268 --> 36:33.234
Dennison's
assistant says

36:33.319 --> 36:34.802
he gave her very
specific instructions

36:34.854 --> 36:36.020
on when and where
to make that call.

36:36.088 --> 36:38.223
All right.
Did you pull his cell records?

36:38.290 --> 36:40.058
Yeah. And the cell
tower he was closest to

36:40.125 --> 36:42.093
was actually less than a mile
from the reenactment site.

36:43.279 --> 36:44.946
All right, I got him.

36:47.099 --> 36:49.150
Kualani Lane and Kahala Avenue.

36:49.201 --> 36:50.902
That's Brandon
and Megan Koruba's house.

36:50.970 --> 36:53.805
They haven't left.

37:19.865 --> 37:21.849
Five-O!

37:32.077 --> 37:32.944
Megan.

37:33.012 --> 37:35.029
Thank God.
Do something.

37:36.698 --> 37:37.966
Put the gun down, Megan.

37:39.184 --> 37:41.586
Megan, you don't
want to do this.

37:41.654 --> 37:42.787
He killed my husband.

37:42.855 --> 37:43.821
She's crazy.

37:43.889 --> 37:46.007
Do something.

37:46.058 --> 37:48.042
Brandon loved you
like a brother.

37:48.093 --> 37:51.379
Why?
Just so you could build a ferry?

37:51.430 --> 37:52.513
You killed him

37:52.565 --> 37:54.315
just so you could
make more money?!

37:57.903 --> 37:58.987
Megan.

38:01.173 --> 38:02.874
Stay back!
Stay back!

38:04.543 --> 38:06.661
Stay back!
Stay back or I'll kill her!

38:15.120 --> 38:16.337
Turn over.

38:16.405 --> 38:17.839
Turn over on your stomach.

38:19.258 --> 38:21.676
It's okay.

38:38.927 --> 38:40.928
♪

38:58.631 --> 38:59.831
Hey, to Danny.

38:59.915 --> 39:00.948
Yes!

39:01.000 --> 39:02.200
To Danny!
Danny!

39:02.267 --> 39:03.501
Thanks for checking.

39:03.585 --> 39:06.421
And double-checking.
Triple-checking.

39:06.472 --> 39:08.206
Hold on. Stop, all right?
I don't know why you guys all

39:08.273 --> 39:10.341
play so hard-to-get, like you
have anything better to do...

39:10.426 --> 39:11.676
Hey, listen, pal,
the only reason

39:11.760 --> 39:12.793
we're here is
'cause you're taking care

39:12.845 --> 39:13.794
of the tab, all right?

39:13.846 --> 39:14.962
You know that.

39:15.014 --> 39:16.764
- First round only I'm picking up.
What?

39:16.815 --> 39:18.466
Told you, told you.

39:18.534 --> 39:20.068
No, what'd I tell you?
I told you that.

39:20.135 --> 39:22.053
I should've, I should've
bet money on that.

39:22.121 --> 39:24.522
Shrimp? Don't you
get enough of

39:24.606 --> 39:25.473
that stuff at work?

39:25.524 --> 39:26.708
Market research.

39:26.775 --> 39:28.593
I got to keep tabs
on the competition.

39:28.661 --> 39:30.695
Yes.

39:30.779 --> 39:32.113
Hey, you.

39:32.164 --> 39:34.482
That was a really good call
on Creed and Urthstrike.

39:34.533 --> 39:36.501
Thanks. Mahalo.

39:36.585 --> 39:38.236
You listened to your gut.

39:38.303 --> 39:40.088
I learned it from you.

39:51.216 --> 39:52.350
Will you relax?

39:52.434 --> 39:53.667
She's right there.

39:53.719 --> 39:55.186
I'm completely fine!
She's right there.

39:55.270 --> 39:56.187
Danny!
I'm completely fine!

39:56.271 --> 39:58.523
You did good, buddy.

39:58.607 --> 39:59.640
He did good!

40:00.859 --> 40:02.694
You did real good.

40:02.778 --> 40:04.145
You picked
a controlled environment,

40:04.196 --> 40:05.363
reduced expectation and pressure

40:05.447 --> 40:07.465
for all three of you.

40:07.533 --> 40:08.783
Good job.

40:08.850 --> 40:09.784
Thank you.

40:09.851 --> 40:12.070
Thanks.

40:15.791 --> 40:17.208
Listen to me.

40:17.292 --> 40:18.376
Go over there.

40:18.460 --> 40:20.194
This is my controlled
environment, okay?

40:20.245 --> 40:21.195
Not yours.

40:21.246 --> 40:23.364
Huh?

40:23.415 --> 40:24.865
Not a word.

40:24.917 --> 40:25.967
Not a word.

40:26.034 --> 40:27.468
I'm-I'm done.

40:27.536 --> 40:29.470
Now I feel like
going over there, okay?

40:29.538 --> 40:31.889
Under my own, uh,
you know, what have you.

40:31.974 --> 40:32.974
All right.

40:34.927 --> 40:36.728
Nice. That's a good one.

40:36.812 --> 40:39.230
Ooh, so pretty.

40:39.298 --> 40:41.099
Maybe one should go...

40:41.183 --> 40:43.534
This is looking
really, really good.

40:43.602 --> 40:44.936
Yeah.

40:45.020 --> 40:46.237
That's really good.

40:46.321 --> 40:47.822
Hey.

40:47.889 --> 40:49.890
What are you
guys making?

40:49.942 --> 40:51.526
It's a Kamehameha butterfly.

40:52.745 --> 40:54.829
Did you know
it's the state insect?

40:54.896 --> 40:56.080
I did know that.

40:56.165 --> 41:00.084
And in Hawaiian,
it's called pulelehua.

41:02.004 --> 41:02.903
Here, Dad, help us.

41:02.955 --> 41:04.038
No, honey.

41:04.089 --> 41:05.423
You guys are doing
such a beautiful job,

41:05.507 --> 41:07.191
I don't want to mess it up;
