01:30.173 --> 01:31.716
Summer in New York City.

01:33.134 --> 01:35.094
It's hot. It's humid.

01:36.596 --> 01:40.099
And everyone's just a little more
pissed off than usual.

01:43.144 --> 01:45.772
Scratch that. A lot more.

01:47.732 --> 01:49.609
Don't wanna be a fly around her.

01:54.489 --> 01:55.865
As I was saying...

01:58.034 --> 01:59.577
anything could set me off.

02:00.703 --> 02:01.913
Her voice.

02:02.956 --> 02:03.956
Her blouse.

02:05.500 --> 02:08.252
My blood would boil. Things got blurry,

02:08.336 --> 02:12.132
but not blurry enough to keep me
from punching her over and over.

02:12.215 --> 02:13.883
I beat my wife for 15 years.

02:14.467 --> 02:16.136
Until she tried to kill herself.

02:16.845 --> 02:18.763
That's when I finally
reached out for help.

02:20.098 --> 02:22.058
I reached out every day of my life.

02:22.809 --> 02:23.809
Wow.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.938
Thanks for sharing.
Could you sign my court card?

02:27.522 --> 02:28.898
At the end of the hour.

02:29.399 --> 02:31.234
It hasn't been an hour yet?

02:32.527 --> 02:33.527
Try it, Jessica.

02:33.570 --> 02:36.573
A benign external action
to soothe internal strife.

02:36.656 --> 02:38.074
I'm just listening today.

02:38.950 --> 02:39.950
Gary?

02:45.415 --> 02:47.917
Every time my dad ran out of meth,

02:48.793 --> 02:49.919
he'd take it out on me.

02:50.795 --> 02:52.255
I'd take it out on my brother.

02:52.338 --> 02:54.090
Fireworks are the worst.

02:54.883 --> 02:56.384
I'm right back in Kabul.

02:57.135 --> 02:59.679
They go off, I just start swinging.

03:00.763 --> 03:03.850
My stepmom kept calling me
a violent delinquent,

03:03.933 --> 03:05.143
so I proved her right.

03:08.897 --> 03:11.608
Nothing will shock us here.
We're all the same.

03:12.442 --> 03:13.902
I doubt that.

03:13.985 --> 03:16.404
Does your anger alienate the people
around you?

03:16.487 --> 03:17.527
Has it affected your work?

03:18.072 --> 03:21.117
Filled you with shame?
Afraid you're not in control of your life?

03:37.133 --> 03:39.552
My whole family was killed
in a car accident.

03:41.930 --> 03:43.932
Someone did horrific experiments on me.

03:44.933 --> 03:46.643
I was abducted,

03:47.810 --> 03:51.105
raped and forced to kill someone.

03:52.357 --> 03:55.902
And now some maniac says
that I am here for a reason.

03:56.486 --> 03:58.321
Like some sick destiny.

03:59.405 --> 04:04.994
She's out killing people
and I'm in here bouncing a goddamn ball!

04:28.351 --> 04:29.686
Sorry about your ball.

04:35.608 --> 04:39.988
In this kind of heat,
everybody needs a little anger management.

04:40.071 --> 04:43.783
Get that piece of shit out of my way,
asshat!

04:43.866 --> 04:44.993
Shut the hell up!

04:45.076 --> 04:47.287
- Calm down, big boy.
- What?

04:57.380 --> 04:59.424
- Excuse me!
- I live here.

04:59.507 --> 05:01.384
Well, congratulations, you live in a dump.

05:02.135 --> 05:05.638
I almost beat the shit out of my
support group today. So take a breath.

05:11.102 --> 05:12.395
Morning.

05:16.399 --> 05:18.067
So how was anger management?

05:22.572 --> 05:23.656
Still angry.

05:34.208 --> 05:35.251
Is Trish okay?

05:35.335 --> 05:37.479
She would've been
if you had done what I told you to do.

05:37.503 --> 05:39.839
You said sit on Trish.
She left, so I followed.

05:39.922 --> 05:41.090
You're just pissing me off.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.633
We know what the killer looks like,

05:42.717 --> 05:44.820
- and that she's strong as hell.
- Pissing me off more.

05:44.844 --> 05:46.929
That woman,
she seriously messed up my shoulder.

05:49.140 --> 05:51.225
I'm fired again. Fine.

06:11.120 --> 06:13.122
All right. Everything is my fault!

06:13.206 --> 06:14.791
I'm not the one who's...

06:14.874 --> 06:17.960
If you stare at something
long enough, it starts to talk to you.

06:20.171 --> 06:22.090
If you could goddamn hear it.

06:38.147 --> 06:41.001
- Don't be mad at Malcolm.
- I'm always mad at Malcolm.

06:41.025 --> 06:43.653
Trish! Trish! Who's the new guy?

06:43.736 --> 06:46.155
- What happened with Griffin?
- Griffin cheat on you?

06:46.239 --> 06:47.240
How long you been dating?

06:47.323 --> 06:51.119
Well, I'm mad at you
for dumping a boatload of crap in my lap.

06:51.202 --> 06:54.205
- I have a lead on the killer.
- You could've led with that.

06:54.288 --> 06:56.040
What do you know about wigs?

06:56.124 --> 06:59.836
Uh... Patsy? Wore one
every day of my life as a kid.

07:00.461 --> 07:03.256
The killer was wearing a wig.
I can see the netting.

07:03.339 --> 07:05.591
I didn't catch it,
which means it's a damn good wig.

07:05.675 --> 07:06.884
Probably human hair.

07:07.468 --> 07:10.348
Tell me there's only a dozen places
in the city that make wigs that good.

07:10.388 --> 07:11.764
Better. There's only three.

07:13.599 --> 07:14.599
We're closed!

07:15.852 --> 07:16.894
No, you're not.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.149
Griffin, you guys finished?

07:21.232 --> 07:24.110
- You want her back, huh, Griff?
- Over here. One last goodbye, huh?

07:24.193 --> 07:26.779
You guys don't actually believe
what you print, do you?

07:26.863 --> 07:30.450
Listen, I have to go
and clean up the mess you made,

07:30.533 --> 07:31.951
then I'll meet you at the stores.

07:32.034 --> 07:34.328
Just text me the address
and I'll meet you there.

07:35.371 --> 07:36.414
What do you want, kid?

07:36.497 --> 07:38.875
I showed you my room. Can I see yours?

07:43.337 --> 07:44.547
I'm busy.

07:44.630 --> 07:47.383
With superhero stuff?
Are you fighting crime?

07:48.509 --> 07:51.304
Can you teach me superpowers? I'm strong.

07:51.387 --> 07:52.547
Can you push a building over?

07:53.347 --> 07:55.766
- Are you bulletproof?
- All right. Cut it out, kid.

07:55.850 --> 07:59.479
How'd you get your superpowers?
Are you an alien? Can you fly?

07:59.562 --> 08:00.747
- Vido!
- Vido!

08:00.771 --> 08:02.315
Where the hell are you?

08:02.398 --> 08:04.817
- Vido! He was just here.
- Vido!

08:04.901 --> 08:06.944
- Vido!
- He's down here!

08:07.028 --> 08:08.362
Come and get him out!

08:09.238 --> 08:11.282
If I fell, would you save me?

08:11.365 --> 08:12.533
Get off that!

08:18.873 --> 08:20.500
- Jesus Christ!
- Vido!

08:27.006 --> 08:29.759
This is exactly
the shit I was talking about, pendejo!

08:30.718 --> 08:31.958
What the hell's wrong with you?

08:33.304 --> 08:37.433
Twenty-five days. You got that?
Then your superpowered ass is outta here.

08:37.933 --> 08:38.933
Sonia!

08:43.898 --> 08:48.110
So, that's it.
We're still a couple, still madly in love

08:48.194 --> 08:51.822
and, uh,
maybe even moving in together, so...

08:55.451 --> 08:58.037
- You guys getting married?
- Is somebody pregnant?

08:58.120 --> 08:59.288
Just one more picture.

08:59.372 --> 09:02.458
- That's it, guys.
- Go chase some alternative facts, yeah?

09:04.502 --> 09:06.337
- Sorry.
- That was insanity.

09:06.420 --> 09:08.172
Well, it comes with the Patsy package.

09:08.256 --> 09:10.967
- Comes with the Jessica package.
- That is a combo package.

09:11.050 --> 09:12.718
Babe, she totally cocked us up.

09:12.802 --> 09:15.054
I get it,
and I talked to her about it, okay?

09:15.137 --> 09:19.225
Listen. If you want to be taken seriously,
report the news, don't be the news.

09:19.308 --> 09:21.143
I get it and I'm working on it.

09:21.936 --> 09:23.938
You know
you don't have to work that hard, right?

09:24.021 --> 09:25.040
- Griffin...
- Just saying.

09:25.064 --> 09:27.858
Let me talk to the guys at ZCN,
see if I can't get you over there.

09:27.942 --> 09:29.318
I love you for offering,

09:29.402 --> 09:33.573
but going to them as Griffin Sinclair's
girlfriend won't get me taken seriously.

09:33.656 --> 09:35.992
I'll get you in the door.
You'll prove yourself from there.

09:36.075 --> 09:38.119
I would rather prove myself
from where I am.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.289
Damn. That's why I love you.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.462
Hey, thank you for doing that.

09:49.255 --> 09:50.255
Yeah.

09:50.923 --> 09:53.050
- I'll see you tonight.
- Absolutely.

10:08.441 --> 10:09.442
Evan?

10:10.985 --> 10:12.778
Try Dr. Zakarian again.

10:15.323 --> 10:16.323
Evan!

10:17.658 --> 10:18.658
Nobody at the gate.

10:19.577 --> 10:22.288
Well, probably better than having
an imbecile there.

10:22.747 --> 10:25.499
Pryce, you shouldn't have wasted a trip.
The decision has been made.

10:26.083 --> 10:29.879
You can't drop the lawsuit against Jones
without consulting the client, me.

10:29.962 --> 10:34.342
Well, given that you work for me,
I felt confident you would agree.

10:34.842 --> 10:37.720
I don't, so I'm hiring a new firm
to take on my case.

10:37.803 --> 10:40.073
- You'll waste your time and money.
- It's not about money.

10:40.097 --> 10:41.849
Everything is about money.

10:42.683 --> 10:43.851
Let it go.

10:44.518 --> 10:45.978
There's enough work for both of you.

10:46.062 --> 10:47.662
I'm not gonna compete with a freak show.

10:47.730 --> 10:52.652
Oh, God. You got beat... by a girl.
Deal with it.

10:52.735 --> 10:54.403
She's not a girl. She's an aberration.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.614
Makes you feel better about yourself,
doesn't it?

10:57.448 --> 11:00.076
Calling her names. Less than. Other.

11:00.159 --> 11:02.328
Makes you feel superior to her.
Well, you're not.

11:02.411 --> 11:05.831
Jones took this nuclear.
Now she's gotta deal with the fallout.

11:05.915 --> 11:07.458
Pryce, you gotta trust me here.

11:07.541 --> 11:11.003
Some things in life you cannot control.
This is one of them.

11:13.964 --> 11:15.508
Man, what happened to you?

11:16.675 --> 11:20.221
The Jeri I knew
wouldn't cede control... to anyone.

11:22.598 --> 11:24.225
A refund for your retainer.

11:25.434 --> 11:27.269
Now neither of us works for the other.

11:30.147 --> 11:32.858
Good luck with whatever your problem is.

11:40.783 --> 11:43.263
I need to hear you say it.
You will never pull that crap again.

11:43.327 --> 11:46.622
I'll never pull that crap again,
unless your safety's on the line.

11:46.705 --> 11:48.082
Wrong answer.

11:48.749 --> 11:52.044
This chick is twice my strength.
I will do what I have to do.

11:52.128 --> 11:53.421
Look. You're afraid. Me, too.

11:53.504 --> 11:58.217
But I haven't had any privacy
since I was 12, when my mother sold it.

11:58.300 --> 12:01.178
I don't need you selling it again,
just so you can bench me.

12:02.346 --> 12:03.597
All right. It was a dick move.

12:04.598 --> 12:05.598
Won't happen again.

12:06.058 --> 12:07.226
Thank you.

12:12.106 --> 12:13.106
After you.

12:13.983 --> 12:14.859
She could be in there.

12:14.942 --> 12:17.111
- Chickenshit.
- Safety first.

12:17.653 --> 12:18.653
Hello?

12:19.530 --> 12:20.614
Customers!

12:21.574 --> 12:24.160
Wow. It hasn't changed in 17 years.

12:24.827 --> 12:27.580
Explains the ghosts of showbiz past.

12:33.711 --> 12:37.047
"Thanks, Sal. You rock.
I really wanna be your friend."

12:45.264 --> 12:48.184
Dear God, it's Patsy.

12:49.310 --> 12:51.187
Sally! Wow. Uh...

12:52.062 --> 12:55.232
- I so remember you.
- And I you.

12:55.316 --> 12:58.068
You destroyed a dozen of my best wigs.

12:58.152 --> 12:59.695
Oh, and this.

12:59.778 --> 13:02.323
I still have the scar
from when you bit me.

13:03.282 --> 13:06.285
I was young. And entitled.

13:06.368 --> 13:08.370
And high out of your bratty mind.

13:08.454 --> 13:10.164
Sober ten years now, thanks.

13:10.748 --> 13:14.210
Patsy Goes to Rehab.
There's your comeback show.

13:14.293 --> 13:17.421
We're looking for this woman.
Has she come in here?

13:22.134 --> 13:24.553
My clients value their privacy.

13:33.604 --> 13:34.688
For the wigs I tore up.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.651
This wouldn't cover synthetic.

13:42.613 --> 13:46.992
She comes in alone.
No name and pays cash. Poor dear.

13:47.076 --> 13:50.829
- Why poor dear?
- She lost all her hair. Chemo, I imagine.

13:50.913 --> 13:55.251
Cancer and drag queens
are half my business these days.

13:55.334 --> 13:56.335
Anything else?

14:07.346 --> 14:09.473
No. That's all.

14:11.892 --> 14:13.602
Now I remember why I bit her.

14:14.186 --> 14:18.023
If the killer had cancer,
maybe IGH saved her, same as me.

14:18.107 --> 14:19.650
Hardly same as you.

14:19.733 --> 14:21.333
If they found her through Metro-General,

14:21.402 --> 14:23.404
chances are they're paying
her medical bills, too.

14:24.530 --> 14:27.867
So we need more than
just your hospital records. Shit.

14:29.493 --> 14:30.828
We need Max.

14:32.204 --> 14:33.914
There's something I have to show you.

14:34.707 --> 14:38.627
I'm not asking.
You're gonna give me what I want.

14:38.919 --> 14:41.714
- Or what?
- Or I'll go public...

14:42.214 --> 14:44.008
with what happened between us.

14:44.717 --> 14:47.720
I was a child. You were 40.

14:47.803 --> 14:50.764
You were 16 going on 30.
Who are you kidding?

14:50.848 --> 14:54.435
I was 15 and my mother pimped me out
for the lead in your crappy movie.

14:54.518 --> 14:56.997
- Malcolm shot this?
- I cast you because you wanted it...

14:57.021 --> 14:58.856
I made him promise not to tell you.

14:58.939 --> 15:00.774
And you knew I'd do anything.

15:01.233 --> 15:03.986
Get off of my set
before I have to call security.

15:04.069 --> 15:06.155
You've got 48 hours
to give me what I want.

15:06.906 --> 15:09.617
You gave Max 48 hours.
It's already been three days.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.243
He's calling my bluff.

15:13.454 --> 15:16.999
- Time to go public.
- So much for reclaiming your privacy.

15:17.082 --> 15:19.835
- It's the only leverage we have.
- I have a better idea.

15:21.545 --> 15:24.340
- Drive.
- Not if you're gonna hurt him.

15:25.591 --> 15:26.591
I'll take a cab.

15:26.634 --> 15:29.053
You're on probation!
Do you wanna go to jail?

15:30.471 --> 15:31.972
I'll try not to hurt him.

15:34.099 --> 15:35.476
This is why I didn't tell you.

15:48.948 --> 15:49.948
Hey.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.577
- You're Trish Walker.
- Yeah.

15:54.244 --> 15:57.331
And I was in a Max Tatum movie
when I was your age.

15:57.414 --> 15:59.458
We got a super fun clip to show you.

16:02.211 --> 16:03.211
Let's go.

16:13.722 --> 16:15.307
PI by day, carpenter by night?

16:18.435 --> 16:22.439
If you wanna talk to Jessica,
which I do not suggest, she's out.

16:23.190 --> 16:24.316
Saw this earlier.

16:25.234 --> 16:27.194
You and Patsy
look like you're good friends.

16:27.277 --> 16:29.905
Makes sense.
You're both recovering addicts.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.156
Wannabe do-gooders.

16:32.741 --> 16:35.577
Wow. You did your homework on me, too.

16:35.661 --> 16:36.661
Goodbye.

16:38.205 --> 16:39.540
You wanna help people.

16:40.249 --> 16:44.670
So that's why you're working with Jones,
hoping maybe she's a hero.

16:45.170 --> 16:46.170
She's not.

16:46.213 --> 16:49.341
No. I work with Jessica
'cause she's a damn good PI.

16:49.425 --> 16:51.093
Good at the dirty work, maybe.

16:51.176 --> 16:53.512
But at my shop,
"altruism" isn't a bad word.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.016
Yeah, I'm sure you guys are
a bunch of saints.

16:57.808 --> 16:59.601
We just believe that

16:59.685 --> 17:02.438
a man can serve himself,
or a man can serve humanity.

17:05.232 --> 17:07.943
Okay, you did not just quote
my father to me.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.737
I did, from his latest article.

17:10.779 --> 17:11.864
What is your game?

17:12.865 --> 17:15.117
You'd fit in well at Cheng Consulting.

17:18.412 --> 17:19.621
Some game.

17:20.539 --> 17:22.540
You hire me in return
for intel on Jessica?

17:22.624 --> 17:24.585
Well, that's up to you, brother.

17:24.667 --> 17:27.421
But do your homework.
See if I'm on the level.

17:34.053 --> 17:37.222
You wanna do your father proud,
give me a call.

17:37.806 --> 17:38.806
See you around.

18:04.374 --> 18:05.793
Oh! Hey! Hey, lady. You okay?

18:09.588 --> 18:12.299
Here.
Let me give you a hand. I got you.

18:13.133 --> 18:14.301
There you go.

18:23.143 --> 18:25.687
I don't care if her agent is on a plane!

18:25.771 --> 18:27.731
Get him on the phone now!

18:30.818 --> 18:33.529
You. You did this.

18:33.612 --> 18:36.073
I gave you a deadline. You missed it.

18:36.156 --> 18:38.617
So you got my star to walk off the set?

18:38.700 --> 18:41.912
- Just played her a little video, Max.
- You'll cost us thousands of dollars.

18:41.995 --> 18:43.205
- Good.
- Hey, Max.

18:44.414 --> 18:48.085
I've heard a lot about you.
All of it nauseating.

18:48.168 --> 18:49.086
Who's this?

18:49.169 --> 18:51.380
Looks like your face got in the way
of someone's fist.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.340
Want a replay?

18:54.258 --> 18:57.845
Is she supposed to scare me?
Like your thuggy boyfriend?

18:58.554 --> 19:01.140
- Is he talking about Malcolm?
- Must've been.

19:01.223 --> 19:04.560
You know what? Go public.
See if you can handle the scrutiny.

19:07.187 --> 19:11.692
- Hey!
- Three letters, perv. IGH.

19:11.775 --> 19:12.651
Get away from me!

19:12.734 --> 19:14.254
- Repeat the letters.
- Jess...

19:14.319 --> 19:15.612
- Repeat them.
- IGH!

19:15.696 --> 19:17.823
Now remember them
for when you call Metro-General

19:17.906 --> 19:20.200
and demand every file they have on IGH.

19:20.284 --> 19:22.077
They're not gonna give me
confidential files.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.621
They will when you tell them
you'll pull your contribution.

19:24.705 --> 19:26.206
Jess!

19:27.374 --> 19:29.042
What the hell are you?

19:29.126 --> 19:32.921
I'm angry. And I'm not sure
there's anything I won't do anymore.

19:34.214 --> 19:36.675
Especially to a prick like you who thinks

19:36.758 --> 19:40.554
that you can take whatever
and whoever you want.

19:40.637 --> 19:44.016
Children, Max!
Little girls!

19:44.099 --> 19:49.688
No! No! I mean, no one else but Trish.
I loved her!

19:50.772 --> 19:52.107
Jess!

19:59.865 --> 20:02.159
Now would be a good time
to make the call, Max.

20:29.728 --> 20:31.021
Yeah.

20:31.104 --> 20:33.273
Hogarth. Chao and Benowitz?

20:33.357 --> 20:34.816
Yeah, I know the name of your firm.

20:35.901 --> 20:39.154
I'm asking if you have anything
on Chao and Benowitz.

20:39.238 --> 20:42.115
I have life and death issues
I'm dealing with over here.

20:42.699 --> 20:43.699
So do I.

20:48.288 --> 20:51.875
Well, I was looking over
their expense accounts.

20:51.959 --> 20:55.420
You'll have to dig deep because
my partners do not make stupid mistakes.

20:56.046 --> 20:59.466
I mean, Chao did charge a safari
on company dime.

21:00.050 --> 21:01.134
Client gift.

21:02.010 --> 21:06.139
Benowitz has $400 on sushi.
$2,000 on Broadway tickets.

21:06.223 --> 21:07.975
Mmm-hmm. Other client gifts.

21:08.058 --> 21:10.769
Jesus. He even spent 700 bucks
on chocolate bars.

21:10.852 --> 21:13.563
Dude, where were my gifts
when I was a client?

21:13.647 --> 21:14.690
You were pro bono.

21:14.773 --> 21:17.734
My time was your gift,
which I don't have anymore.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.445
I have to shut down
this buyout.

21:22.155 --> 21:26.952
All right. Well, I'll keep looking into
all this corporate generosity.

21:27.911 --> 21:29.413
Let me know when you find something.

21:31.415 --> 21:32.582
Jessica?

21:32.666 --> 21:34.501
- Yeah?
- Thank you.

21:36.628 --> 21:37.671
Okay.

21:51.184 --> 21:52.602
What did I do now?

21:52.686 --> 21:54.771
Read your mail? Kill your cat?

21:54.855 --> 21:56.189
You saved Vido's life.

21:57.232 --> 21:58.608
He told me.

21:59.234 --> 22:01.945
I can't pay you back for that. Ever.

22:03.613 --> 22:06.408
But I'm tearing up
the eviction notice, and...

22:07.659 --> 22:09.077
I wanted to say thank you.

22:09.661 --> 22:10.661
Here.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.419
I was an asshole.

22:19.004 --> 22:20.672
I'm just scared of losing my son.

22:22.174 --> 22:23.174
I'm sorry.

22:31.558 --> 22:32.558
Hey.

22:35.687 --> 22:38.732
I am totally fine
to drink this by myself...

22:40.859 --> 22:42.736
if that's what you had in mind.

23:13.517 --> 23:14.726
Oh, God.

23:24.736 --> 23:26.988
I've had such shitty taste
in men.

23:28.532 --> 23:29.532
Thank you?

23:30.075 --> 23:32.035
Until now.

23:32.619 --> 23:34.621
Still a weird first thought.

23:34.704 --> 23:35.956
I just meant...

23:37.499 --> 23:39.709
any of the others wouldn't have
stuck around.

23:40.710 --> 23:42.712
- Bunch of limp-dicks.
- True that.

23:43.588 --> 23:45.090
So why the parade of losers?

23:46.550 --> 23:49.344
Or, more to the point, how am I different?

23:49.427 --> 23:51.555
Are you looking for reassurance?

23:51.638 --> 23:53.807
Never underestimate the neediness
of the male ego.

23:53.890 --> 23:54.890
Never.

23:57.435 --> 23:59.104
I don't know. I guess...

24:01.398 --> 24:02.899
I love that moment.

24:03.984 --> 24:08.363
You know,
that "wow, you're special" moment.

24:09.573 --> 24:10.573
"You matter."

24:12.868 --> 24:14.077
It's like drugs.

24:15.871 --> 24:17.956
I know it well.

24:18.832 --> 24:24.713
Yeah, my last five shrinks would say, uh,
it's about needing the love of my mother.

24:25.964 --> 24:29.217
I could give a dissertation
on narcissism at this point.

24:29.926 --> 24:32.137
- You're quite therapized, aren't you?
- Oh, yeah.

24:32.220 --> 24:33.638
I thought about going that road,

24:33.722 --> 24:38.768
but then I thought articulating my damage
might kill my ambition.

24:38.852 --> 24:40.228
It hasn't killed mine.

24:41.021 --> 24:42.939
No, it hasn't, my girl.

24:49.112 --> 24:50.906
- Shower?
- Mmm-hmm.

24:52.115 --> 24:53.909
Mmm.

24:57.120 --> 24:58.622
That's mine.

25:10.967 --> 25:12.844
I can't talk. She's right here.

25:15.013 --> 25:18.183
Okay, just, uh, just wait a second.

25:21.436 --> 25:22.646
Go ahead.

25:23.605 --> 25:25.398
No, she doesn't know anything.

25:26.441 --> 25:27.776
Let's keep it that way.

25:29.277 --> 25:33.031
Okay, so, for the record...

25:34.532 --> 25:36.785
I don't have a problem
with people like you.

25:39.037 --> 25:40.330
It was just you.

25:41.498 --> 25:43.708
Okay. Thanks.

25:43.792 --> 25:46.419
No. I mean with your timing.

25:48.463 --> 25:50.674
Look, I only got out of prison
six months ago.

25:51.967 --> 25:55.595
I'm just trying to fly under the radar,
focus on being a dad.

25:58.306 --> 26:00.267
A dad who forges green cards.

26:01.101 --> 26:04.229
I'm not judging.
A good custody lawyer is expensive.

26:07.440 --> 26:11.403
That forgery thing?
It's kinda like my superpower.

26:12.112 --> 26:15.198
I'm good at it. Great, actually.

26:18.118 --> 26:20.036
I use what I got to fight for that kid.

26:20.996 --> 26:22.205
I'm not ashamed of that.

26:24.791 --> 26:26.584
Well, your ex is a piece of work.

26:28.545 --> 26:31.756
We grew up together, you know?
She used to be cool.

26:32.799 --> 26:35.135
Nasty doesn't just come out of nowhere.

26:38.013 --> 26:39.264
Yeah, maybe you're right.

26:40.181 --> 26:41.301
She never directed it at me.

26:45.395 --> 26:47.105
We are who we are.

26:48.398 --> 26:51.192
So how is it you are who you are?

26:51.985 --> 26:54.154
Hmm? Super?

26:54.654 --> 26:57.532
- We prefer "gifted."
- Really?

26:57.615 --> 27:00.869
I really couldn't possibly
give less of a shit.

27:04.998 --> 27:07.292
But that's always the question.

27:07.959 --> 27:11.921
"What are you?"
"How did you end up like this?"

27:12.672 --> 27:13.965
And, "Are you gonna kill me?"

27:14.549 --> 27:16.051
People actually ask you that?

27:17.385 --> 27:18.803
It comes up.

27:22.724 --> 27:23.725
And?

27:25.435 --> 27:27.228
I'm not gonna kill you, Oscar.

27:27.312 --> 27:29.606
Only because I like your kid.

27:30.774 --> 27:34.319
- You are definitely an unusual woman.
- One of a kind.

27:36.279 --> 27:37.405
Mmm...

27:38.615 --> 27:39.991
That must be a pain in the ass.

27:40.950 --> 27:42.660
People judging you all the time.

27:44.037 --> 27:45.622
I mean, explains your misanthropy.

27:47.415 --> 27:49.000
I'm not a misanthrope.

27:49.084 --> 27:52.837
Really? 'Cause it kinda seems
like you hate people.

27:52.921 --> 27:54.214
Mnh-mnh.

27:54.297 --> 27:55.799
No. Just you.

27:59.427 --> 28:00.637
Good thing I have Vido then.

28:02.305 --> 28:05.683
He's a cool kid.
Reckless little shit, but he's cool.

28:05.767 --> 28:06.768
Yeah.

28:08.686 --> 28:09.687
Yeah, he likes you, too.

28:11.189 --> 28:13.191
He's usually right about people, so...

28:15.527 --> 28:17.195
You must be okay.

28:36.214 --> 28:37.382
Whoa, whoa. Hey!

28:37.465 --> 28:39.175
Whoa... Wow! That's, um...

28:42.762 --> 28:43.847
What?

28:45.014 --> 28:48.935
- Half an hour ago you hated me.
- And you were evicting me. So?

28:49.018 --> 28:51.730
Yeah, I just got a little whiplash,
that's all.

28:52.480 --> 28:54.232
Well, we're both adults.

28:54.983 --> 28:56.484
Sure. It's just...

28:58.319 --> 28:59.738
This isn't normal.

29:05.744 --> 29:07.120
- Because I'm not.
- No.

29:07.787 --> 29:10.707
I meant this, not... Not you.

29:10.790 --> 29:13.126
This isn't.

29:16.212 --> 29:17.630
I'm just gonna...

29:18.214 --> 29:19.214
Yeah.

29:34.147 --> 29:38.067
Finally. I'm surprised
that perv came through.

29:38.943 --> 29:41.446
I should have punched him
in the Tesla years ago.

29:44.199 --> 29:45.867
Yeah, I'm on my way there now.

29:47.285 --> 29:49.454
- Hey, Jessica.
- I'm leaving.

29:49.537 --> 29:52.415
- No, I need to talk to you.
- Send me a note.

29:52.499 --> 29:53.666
Pryce was here.

29:54.459 --> 29:55.502
And he offered me a job.

29:56.669 --> 30:00.089
- You wanna work for Pryce?
- No. That's why I'm telling you.

30:00.173 --> 30:03.134
- He's trying to screw with you.
- Yeah, it sounds like it.

30:03.218 --> 30:05.220
Look, Jess, um...

30:05.762 --> 30:08.473
You saved my life. You've got me clean.

30:08.556 --> 30:10.236
You're giving me
somewhere to be every day.

30:10.308 --> 30:13.686
But I can't just sit in your office
and do nothing. I...

30:13.770 --> 30:15.980
Addicts, we're not good at doing nothing.

30:18.316 --> 30:19.526
You could always call Pryce.

30:20.527 --> 30:21.527
Hey.

30:23.696 --> 30:27.116
Stop treating me
like an annoying little brother, okay?

30:27.200 --> 30:29.202
I've got skills and you goddamn need me.

30:29.285 --> 30:32.372
So, you're gonna start trusting me
and teaching me

30:32.455 --> 30:35.792
and giving me 25% of every case
that walks through that door.

30:43.132 --> 30:44.259
Twenty percent.

30:47.846 --> 30:48.846
Yeah.

30:51.474 --> 30:52.767
Malcolm?

30:55.019 --> 30:57.480
Glass house here. Throwing no stones.

31:02.569 --> 31:04.821
I can leave now, if you want.

31:04.904 --> 31:07.532
No. Um, sorry, Marissa.

31:07.615 --> 31:09.033
Marissa?

31:09.909 --> 31:12.829
I mean, Maria? Macey?

31:19.419 --> 31:20.712
Anna.

31:20.795 --> 31:22.964
Jeri. Did we have an appointment?

31:23.047 --> 31:24.883
No. You didn't have any openings.

31:24.966 --> 31:26.718
So you made an opening.

31:27.510 --> 31:28.595
Sit.

31:34.225 --> 31:36.311
You having problems with your meds?

31:36.394 --> 31:37.770
They're pointless.

31:38.897 --> 31:41.149
Let's talk alternative options.

31:41.774 --> 31:46.195
Okay. Well, there are studies
all around the world, in Israel...

31:46.279 --> 31:48.531
Give me a timetable on the cure.

31:49.490 --> 31:50.825
- The cure?
- Mmm-hmm.

31:50.909 --> 31:54.746
Years. Maybe decades.

31:54.829 --> 31:56.915
But there have been advancements
in palliative...

31:56.998 --> 31:59.834
What about the illicit
cutting-edge studies?

31:59.918 --> 32:02.712
The ones that aren't slowed down
by regulations?

32:02.795 --> 32:05.340
I know you track those.

32:05.423 --> 32:08.509
And I would tell you
if any of them showed promise.

32:09.928 --> 32:13.181
Would you?
Even if they weren't entirely legal?

32:18.728 --> 32:20.146
What are you asking me?

32:21.564 --> 32:23.650
There's an option
that we haven't discussed.

32:25.568 --> 32:28.488
I have been researching the drugs
that they use in Europe.

32:28.571 --> 32:30.823
They're less messy
than the ones they use here

32:30.907 --> 32:32.617
in the states that allow it.

32:33.576 --> 32:36.663
I want something quick,
painless and guaranteed.

32:41.834 --> 32:43.378
You think I'm a coward?

32:44.629 --> 32:48.257
Coward is the last word
that I would use to describe you.

32:50.051 --> 32:53.680
You know my father died of brain cancer.

32:54.263 --> 32:56.474
He was the same age that I am now.

32:57.308 --> 33:01.229
He couldn't feed himself. Couldn't talk.

33:01.312 --> 33:04.148
He just drooled and shit himself.

33:05.566 --> 33:07.360
Took two hideous years to kill him.

33:08.861 --> 33:10.363
I'm sure it was horrible.

33:10.446 --> 33:14.325
Two years is a blessing.
You told me that the ALS could take eight.

33:16.327 --> 33:17.829
Again, there are palliative drugs.

33:17.912 --> 33:21.791
Oh, my God. Is that the only thing
they taught you in medical school?

33:21.874 --> 33:24.919
They taught me to value life,
in whatever form it takes...

33:25.003 --> 33:27.839
Screw you and screw your training.

33:27.922 --> 33:33.678
Okay, there is a killer inside of me,
and I will not give it control.

33:33.761 --> 33:36.723
- I'm sorry, but...
- I will get what I need.

33:37.849 --> 33:42.645
Either from you or from some back-alley
drug dealer in Amsterdam.

33:44.522 --> 33:45.982
But I would rather it be you.

33:46.607 --> 33:47.734
So would I.

33:51.362 --> 33:52.363
You're useless.

33:53.531 --> 33:54.531
Jeri.

33:56.325 --> 33:57.410
Jeri.

33:58.870 --> 34:00.663
Max sent it over by messenger.

34:00.747 --> 34:02.081
He can't face you.

34:02.165 --> 34:03.165
Good.

34:06.335 --> 34:07.545
Is this it?

34:07.628 --> 34:11.591
Yes. But it lists the patients
whose bills were paid for by IGH.

34:11.674 --> 34:16.637
There's only three.
You, Whizzer and someone named Inez Green.

34:16.721 --> 34:18.514
Inez Green.

34:19.599 --> 34:22.685
Well, for nine bucks
we can find out if she's got a jacket.

34:24.228 --> 34:27.899
Her medical record doesn't say
she had cancer or anything else.

34:27.982 --> 34:29.817
Just that she came through the ER.

34:29.900 --> 34:34.155
"Emergency contact: not applicable.
Next of kin: not applicable."

34:34.237 --> 34:36.491
Hmm, no family, no friends.
Sound familiar?

34:36.574 --> 34:38.076
Stop comparing yourself to her.

34:38.159 --> 34:40.078
I'm not relating. I'm just profiling.

34:42.330 --> 34:44.456
All right. Found her.

34:45.875 --> 34:49.670
There's no photo.
Just six misdemeanor citations.

34:49.754 --> 34:51.464
Panhandling, vagrancy...

34:53.466 --> 34:54.675
She's homeless.

34:55.176 --> 34:56.260
Makes sense.

34:56.344 --> 34:59.180
Probably can't deal
with a boss or a landlord.

35:00.139 --> 35:03.101
- All right, now I'm relating.
- Don't. Just keep looking.

35:06.187 --> 35:08.481
All of her citations are
from the same neighborhood.

35:09.315 --> 35:13.736
You know what? I know this area.
It's mostly condemned buildings.

35:13.820 --> 35:14.862
Sounds dangerous.

35:15.404 --> 35:16.906
Not for her.

35:16.989 --> 35:20.326
If she's our killer, then God help
the hobo who crosses her wrong.

35:20.409 --> 35:22.662
Well, we'll need some stopping power.

35:24.372 --> 35:25.372
Too much?

35:27.500 --> 35:29.961
Not unless you're going
grocery shopping in Texas.

35:30.044 --> 35:31.921
I don't want her to hurt anyone else.

35:32.505 --> 35:36.342
A, we don't even know if Inez
and the killer are the same person.

35:36.425 --> 35:40.012
And B, if we take her out,
IGH will just send someone else.

35:40.096 --> 35:43.182
Okay. We need her alive.
But how do we stop her if we find her?

35:46.310 --> 35:47.310
Maybe this?

35:47.937 --> 35:49.105
What is it?

35:49.188 --> 35:51.440
Looks like some kind of modified Taser.

35:51.524 --> 35:52.900
Enough to take her down?

35:54.986 --> 35:56.654
I don't know. Zap me.

35:58.990 --> 36:00.324
I'm not gonna zap you.

36:00.408 --> 36:03.411
If it takes me out, we'll know
it will at least slow her down.

36:03.494 --> 36:05.788
- So just zap me.
- I'm not gonna zap you!

36:05.872 --> 36:07.206
Just zap me, God damn it.

36:10.042 --> 36:11.169
Jess?

36:12.420 --> 36:14.755
Jess? Jess, wake up.

36:14.839 --> 36:17.425
Oh, my God, Jess? Jess.

36:22.013 --> 36:24.015
Well, that'll work.

36:25.474 --> 36:26.809
Have you seen this woman?

36:27.768 --> 36:29.854
Have you ever seen her around here?

36:31.314 --> 36:34.025
Okay, well, um, thank you.
Sorry to bother you.

36:38.070 --> 36:39.530
They've never seen her.

36:45.745 --> 36:48.998
Hey, it takes a lot
before people end up like this.

36:50.291 --> 36:52.793
I... I hear you ladies are looking
for somebody.

36:52.877 --> 36:54.921
Yeah. Inez Green.
Do you know her?

36:55.004 --> 36:58.716
I call her Mean-ez Mean.
Woman hates everybody.

36:58.799 --> 37:00.593
- She's a misanthrope.
- Is, uh...

37:02.011 --> 37:03.011
Is this her?

37:03.554 --> 37:04.847
She's blonde, not a brunette.

37:05.723 --> 37:07.723
- Maybe she has more than one wig?
- Is she around?

37:13.231 --> 37:14.732
Just take it.

37:14.815 --> 37:18.402
She's holed up in the old bank building.
Got her own padlock.

37:19.153 --> 37:20.153
Thank you.

37:22.156 --> 37:25.576
Oh, uh, watch your back. She's crazy-ass.

37:25.660 --> 37:29.538
She sent a guy to the hospital
just for looking at her wrong.

38:39.608 --> 38:40.818
I'll flush her out.

38:42.278 --> 38:44.697
When she reaches
the bottom of the stairs, zap her.

39:45.841 --> 39:46.841
Jess?

39:47.551 --> 39:48.886
Jess, are you okay?

39:51.389 --> 39:52.390
Jess!

40:09.281 --> 40:10.324
Wait!

40:15.287 --> 40:16.747
Who the hell is this?

41:05.087 --> 41:08.132
- My apartment is this way.
- But I wanna see...

41:11.177 --> 41:14.638
Then she can close her eyes
while we swipe some booze.

41:14.722 --> 41:17.725
It's open, which means
that she's home, so let's go.

41:17.808 --> 41:21.312
Yeah, but you've got nothing
to drink at your place.

41:21.395 --> 41:22.730
For good reason.

41:25.608 --> 41:28.110
I want to meet a real PI.

41:28.194 --> 41:29.403
I'm a real PI.

41:29.487 --> 41:31.906
Oh. Then investigate some booze, PI.

41:33.574 --> 41:35.159
Look. Okay...

41:35.242 --> 41:39.205
You have had enough booze, so...

41:44.627 --> 41:46.128
She's not home.

41:46.212 --> 41:49.340
- Good thing she left the door unlocked.
- No, no, no.

42:45.813 --> 42:46.813
Inez.

42:49.441 --> 42:51.777
Inez, I'm gonna need you
to wake up and focus.

42:56.156 --> 42:58.396
- Who the hell are you?
- Who the hell are you?

42:58.742 --> 43:01.787
- Get away from me! Don't touch my stuff!
- We don't want your stuff.

43:02.788 --> 43:06.125
We just want to know why you're hiding.
Who's after you?

43:06.208 --> 43:09.211
After me?
Every loser out there with a dick.

43:09.295 --> 43:11.064
Know what it's like to be a woman
on the streets?

43:11.088 --> 43:12.423
Why'd IGH pay your medical bills?

43:12.506 --> 43:14.758
- You guys are with IGH?
- No.

43:14.842 --> 43:16.562
I said I'd never say anything,
and I didn't.

43:16.594 --> 43:17.886
We're not with IGH.

43:18.512 --> 43:19.972
Okay, we're looking for someone.

43:22.308 --> 43:23.668
Do you know this woman?

43:24.393 --> 43:27.646
- Are you freaking crazy?
- That'd be a yes.

43:27.730 --> 43:30.232
Why do you wanna find her?
You got a death wish?

43:30.316 --> 43:32.443
We know how dangerous she is.

43:32.526 --> 43:35.446
You don't know shit.
She gave me these.

43:36.196 --> 43:37.956
I don't want anything to do
with that animal.

43:38.032 --> 43:40.117
Those scars are the reason
you need to help us.

43:40.200 --> 43:41.785
Trish, back off!

43:43.454 --> 43:44.455
It's okay.

43:48.000 --> 43:52.171
- Did she do that when you were a patient?
- I wasn't a patient. I was a nurse.

43:52.254 --> 43:54.965
- You worked for IGH?
- She was the patient.

43:59.219 --> 44:00.219
Tell me.

44:08.646 --> 44:13.359
We were just... putting her to bed and...

44:15.152 --> 44:17.321
she threw me like I was a rag doll.

44:18.822 --> 44:20.616
Ten feet into a glass cabinet.

44:22.076 --> 44:23.202
I broke my back.

44:24.203 --> 44:25.954
Glass ripped me to shreds.

44:27.373 --> 44:29.833
Then she got Luanne, the other nurse.

44:31.669 --> 44:34.797
She twisted that poor girl's head
clean around.

44:38.092 --> 44:42.930
She had this look in her eyes.
It was pure rage...

44:43.013 --> 44:45.891
like... like I was a thing in her way.

44:45.974 --> 44:48.519
Like I wasn't even a human being.

44:51.688 --> 44:54.441
There was something wrong with her.
Something terrible.

45:02.783 --> 45:05.244
- You have any trouble?
- Nothing I couldn't handle.

45:05.911 --> 45:08.497
I got all the stuff you flagged
and a whole lot more.

45:08.580 --> 45:10.791
I'm sure she's been sitting
on some twisted shit.

45:10.874 --> 45:11.959
No way she's straight up.

45:13.168 --> 45:14.336
Her cases are yours now.

45:15.129 --> 45:17.631
And if she's dirty,
it's in there somewhere.

45:18.382 --> 45:19.800
We'll bury her.

45:19.883 --> 45:23.679
My man. I'll crack open
the Macallan when you get here, bud.

45:23.762 --> 45:26.765
The 18 or the 25? I got standards.

45:26.849 --> 45:28.183
Yeah? Since when?

45:28.267 --> 45:31.186
I buy nice stuff.
I just don't share it with you.

45:31.770 --> 45:33.939
The last scotch you bought came
in a plastic container.

45:34.857 --> 45:36.108
What the... Get off me, lady.

45:37.651 --> 45:38.651
Nick?

45:41.905 --> 45:44.074
Nick? Nick, what's going on?

45:54.042 --> 45:56.378
Nick? Nick?

45:58.755 --> 46:00.215
Nick!

46:04.470 --> 46:06.180
911 Emergency.

46:15.355 --> 46:16.940
She wasn't describing you.

46:17.733 --> 46:19.610
Same anger, same rage.

46:25.532 --> 46:28.702
Hey, there's no one chasing us.
Will you slow down?

46:29.286 --> 46:31.246
Inez could be a target.
We have to protect her.

46:31.330 --> 46:34.833
We will, unless you flip this thing
and kill us all.

46:44.092 --> 46:45.719
- What's wrong?
- Stay in the car.

46:56.772 --> 46:57.772
Hey.

46:59.691 --> 47:03.153
- Turn around. Go. They think you did this.
- Did what?

47:03.237 --> 47:05.656
Jessica Jones! Hands behind your head!

47:07.533 --> 47:10.994
- On the ground! Now!
- Inez, in the car. Keep her safe.

47:11.078 --> 47:12.579
Get down on the ground, now!

47:14.748 --> 47:17.209
- Jesus Christ.
- Hey! Let her go!

47:17.292 --> 47:18.919
- Step back!
- Like hell I will.

47:19.503 --> 47:21.046
Trish, don't!

47:21.129 --> 47:22.129
Trish!

47:23.924 --> 47:28.345
Jessica Jones, you're under arrest
for the murder of Nicholas Spanos.

47:28.428 --> 47:29.471
I don't know who that is!

47:29.555 --> 47:31.348
You have the right to remain silent.

47:31.431 --> 47:35.060
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

47:35.143 --> 47:36.423
You have a right to an attorney.

47:36.478 --> 47:38.939
If you can't afford one,
one will be appointed for you.

47:39.940 --> 47:41.191
It's not me.

47:50.576 --> 47:51.702
That's not me.

47:56.999 --> 47:58.333
That's not me.
