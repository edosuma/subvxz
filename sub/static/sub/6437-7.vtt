WEBVTT

00:05.005 --> 00:06.506
My father dissolves
our marriage

00:06.673 --> 00:08.504
in favor of more
promising opportunity.

00:08.675 --> 00:11.917
- Is there nothing left between us?
- Memories only.

00:12.095 --> 00:13.926
Agron: The arena has burned
to fucking ground...

00:14.097 --> 00:15.086
( screams )

00:15.265 --> 00:17.426
...with many Romans
among the ashes!

00:17.601 --> 00:19.091
Spartacus:
Can he be healed?

00:19.269 --> 00:21.521
Lucius: This man--
beyond what should warrant life.

00:21.688 --> 00:24.100
Gannicus: His name is Oenomaus
and he is more than common man.

00:24.274 --> 00:26.014
100 more bodies
pulled from the arena.

00:26.193 --> 00:28.104
This was found
in the wreckage.

00:28.278 --> 00:31.315
llithyia: The gods have punished me
by striking down my father.

00:31.490 --> 00:33.026
- It is not enough.
- Gaius.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.657
The only reason you have not
joined your father

00:35.827 --> 00:37.488
is the child
that grows within you.

00:37.663 --> 00:40.871
House slaves will never be gladiators.
We need fighting men.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.783
Perhaps it is time to revisit
plans towards Neapolis

00:43.961 --> 00:46.077
and slaver ships
from foreign wars.

00:46.255 --> 00:48.166
( chuckles )
You would attack the port?

00:48.340 --> 00:50.422
(theme music playing )

00:56.723 --> 00:59.260
-( rain pattering )
- ( thunder rumbling)

01:02.729 --> 01:04.890
Man: I do not care
for the fucking rain,

01:05.065 --> 01:07.226
nor disturbance
at unreasonable hour.

01:07.401 --> 01:10.893
lwould have you quickly removed
from such concerns...

01:11.947 --> 01:14.108
and well compensated

01:14.283 --> 01:17.400
for allowing eyes
upon your latest offering...

01:18.412 --> 01:21.324
in advance of auction.

01:21.498 --> 01:24.410
Man: You must have pressing needs,
to venture out on such a night.

01:24.585 --> 01:27.622
I fear the rising sun
would dash hopes of them being met.

01:27.796 --> 01:29.411
Short of time,
long of coin--

01:29.590 --> 01:31.922
what form of slave
narrows your purpose?

01:32.092 --> 01:34.834
Lucius: l have a desire
towards fighting men.

01:35.012 --> 01:36.718
Man: Ah, gladiators.

01:36.888 --> 01:39.345
l've supplied Rome with many
of its finest champions.

01:39.516 --> 01:42.349
Sadly, with the arena
in Capua gone,

01:42.519 --> 01:46.478
there is less interest in base men
of such talents.

01:46.648 --> 01:48.513
Fortunate for my cause then.

01:48.692 --> 01:51.900
Come, let us see
how you can further aid it.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.466
Thick of the stench,

02:20.641 --> 02:24.099
savages east of the Rhine
tend to favor their own shit.

02:24.269 --> 02:27.352
I intended to have them scrubbed
and oiled before auction,

02:27.522 --> 02:31.106
but I fear that would do little
to improve their natural odor.

02:31.276 --> 02:32.607
And how do you find
the women?

02:32.778 --> 02:34.939
As unpleasant
as their men.

02:36.031 --> 02:38.522
I would not recommend
lustful...

03:12.859 --> 03:15.316
(woman shouts)

03:31.837 --> 03:34.044
Finish quickly. Release them.

03:47.519 --> 03:48.759
You're not from our lands.

03:48.937 --> 03:50.768
Yet l was once bound in chains

03:50.939 --> 03:53.021
by the Romans, as you were--

03:53.191 --> 03:56.183
a grievance I would see them
pay dearly for.

04:02.617 --> 04:04.824
( men cheering )

04:04.995 --> 04:06.735
This says they are with us.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.169
A fortunate thing

04:20.343 --> 04:22.425
that we liberate a ship
filled with your people.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.587
The gods favor us.

04:24.765 --> 04:28.428
No longer will we have to listen
to those fucking Gauls again.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.058
( laughs)

04:30.228 --> 04:31.934
(shouts)

04:39.488 --> 04:42.275
Good Mercato
spoke highly of you.

04:42.449 --> 04:43.859
A grave misfortune

04:44.034 --> 04:45.865
that his tongue
has forever been silenced.

04:46.036 --> 04:48.448
His passing cause
for my presence before you.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.658
Passing?
( chuckles )

04:50.832 --> 04:53.448
Too gentle a word for
how he was ushered from this life,

04:53.627 --> 04:55.913
blood and brains staining
the pulvinus

04:56.087 --> 04:57.952
as he thought to flee
Spartacus's wrath.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.463
Gannicus: A thing that threatens
to consume many innocent lives.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.795
Gallienus: We have thought you
but mangled corpse

05:02.969 --> 05:05.460
and the sundered beams
of the arena your tomb.

05:05.639 --> 05:09.257
The events of the day caused me
absent proper mind.

05:09.434 --> 05:10.594
It has since returned.

05:10.769 --> 05:12.259
And you to our streets.

05:12.437 --> 05:14.814
Mercato my purpose,
as I said.

05:14.981 --> 05:17.233
There is the matter of coin

05:17.400 --> 05:19.356
for services tendered
upon the sands.

05:19.528 --> 05:23.066
You were secured to execute those shits
that follow Spartacus.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.322
I do not recall any
falling to your sword.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.574
It would have happened,
had Spartacus not appeared.

05:27.744 --> 05:29.530
And coin would have
materialized the same.

05:29.704 --> 05:31.160
But the past
cannot be altered.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.492
I am without coin, Magistrate.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.328
I would not have returned
otherwise.

05:46.847 --> 05:49.680
For your years of pleasing
the crowd in the arena.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.806
Now follow

05:51.977 --> 05:54.263
once noble monument,
and collapse from sight.

05:55.814 --> 05:57.725
Magistrate, apologies.

05:59.025 --> 06:02.062
My rudis was lost
when the arena fell.

06:02.237 --> 06:04.353
- Without it--
- You press beyond reason.

06:04.531 --> 06:06.112
Glaber:
||| wind has blown Capua

06:06.283 --> 06:09.275
from once-steady course.

06:09.452 --> 06:11.613
Take further matter
to Praetor Glaber.

06:11.788 --> 06:14.279
Perhaps you can entice coin
from him as well,

06:14.457 --> 06:16.197
if caught upon proper mood.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.992
Glaber: ...and misfortune.

06:20.297 --> 06:22.583
We have all suffered loss

06:22.757 --> 06:24.918
of those closest to us.

06:25.093 --> 06:28.381
Even a senator
of our great Republic,

06:28.555 --> 06:33.174
a man my wife called father,

06:33.351 --> 06:35.387
has been ripped
from this world

06:35.562 --> 06:38.474
by Spartacus
and his mongrel hordes!

06:41.192 --> 06:43.979
And now beloved Seppius

06:44.154 --> 06:46.395
has fallen

06:46.573 --> 06:50.065
to this festering disease
of rebellion,

06:50.243 --> 06:54.202
murdered by his own slaves,

06:54.372 --> 06:57.239
who even now
spirit themselves away

06:57.417 --> 06:59.453
to join Spartacus
against us!

06:59.628 --> 07:01.710
(crowd murmuring)

07:01.880 --> 07:02.869
What?

07:03.048 --> 07:05.755
Glaber: We must be ever vigilant
in these dark times.

07:05.926 --> 07:08.008
We must bring to light

07:08.178 --> 07:11.466
even dimmest shadow
of betrayal,

07:11.640 --> 07:14.006
if it is revealed to us.

07:16.061 --> 07:17.972
From this day forward,

07:18.146 --> 07:20.137
any slave

07:20.315 --> 07:23.273
who dares to whisper
the name Spartacus

07:23.443 --> 07:25.354
shall be put to death...

07:25.528 --> 07:27.234
(crowd murmuring)

07:36.122 --> 07:37.987
...even those

07:38.166 --> 07:40.782
owned by a praetor of Rome.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.917
( crowd exclaiming )

07:43.088 --> 07:44.453
Seize her.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.171
(whimpering)

07:47.342 --> 07:49.424
Dominus, I did nothing.

08:01.439 --> 08:03.304
Dominus.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.144
( whispers )
Do not speak against him.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.979
Listen how she begs,

08:07.153 --> 08:09.018
pleading with the very tongue

08:09.197 --> 08:13.031
that only yesterday held praise
for Spartacus upon it,

08:13.201 --> 08:15.157
praise for the slaves

08:15.328 --> 08:17.159
that murdered Seppius,

08:17.330 --> 08:20.242
praise most fortunate
to be overheard

08:20.417 --> 08:22.499
by loyal wife.

08:28.550 --> 08:30.211
Domina?

08:37.475 --> 08:39.852
It is true.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.386
I heard her speak it.

08:42.564 --> 08:44.771
(whimpering)

08:45.984 --> 08:48.145
Would that she had
more than one life to take.

08:49.279 --> 08:52.316
Let this serve as warning

08:52.490 --> 08:54.230
to any slave

08:54.409 --> 08:57.572
who would conspire
against us.

08:58.580 --> 09:00.491
(snaps fingers)

09:00.665 --> 09:02.166
(sobbing loudly)

09:03.209 --> 09:05.746
(screaming )

09:31.654 --> 09:34.111
( metal clanging )

09:58.014 --> 09:59.754
Apologies.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.093
None deserved.

10:04.270 --> 10:05.885
It was a foolish attempt.

10:06.064 --> 10:07.975
You seek to part
head from shoulders.

10:09.234 --> 10:12.101
There are blows that kill
with less effort.

10:13.154 --> 10:14.940
Then I shall learn them.

10:17.659 --> 10:19.775
He is never from her side.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.194
Spartacus wanted him
towards Neapolis,

10:22.372 --> 10:24.328
but he would not leave her.

10:26.042 --> 10:28.283
Though perhaps it's best to keep
him and Agron parted.

10:29.420 --> 10:31.502
Naevia's blessed
to be loved so deeply.

10:31.673 --> 10:33.538
As are you,

10:33.716 --> 10:35.422
by Spartacus.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.137
Crixus.

10:55.238 --> 10:57.103
I taught you

10:57.282 --> 11:00.115
never to lower guard.

11:00.285 --> 11:02.651
Now see Naevia
to same instruction.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.820
Oenomaus.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.205
As I you.

11:12.422 --> 11:15.255
Yet we did not escape
deep wounds.

11:15.425 --> 11:18.041
A thing to be visited upon
the Romans a thousandfold,

11:18.219 --> 11:21.006
now that Oenomaus
stands with us once again.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.671
He was a fool

11:22.849 --> 11:24.840
- to be gone so long from your side.
- ( gate opens )

11:25.018 --> 11:26.929
Spartacus: Such things are
of the past.

11:28.354 --> 11:31.517
Let us turn thought
towards future

11:31.691 --> 11:33.852
and what joys
it may hold.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.359
( people chattering, laughing )

11:47.040 --> 11:48.621
You have done
the impossible.

11:51.252 --> 11:52.492
Hey.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.340
( crowd laughs )

12:10.021 --> 12:12.558
- Our ranks swell.
- We will need more weapons--

12:12.732 --> 12:14.643
a concern
that must be addressed.

12:17.362 --> 12:19.353
I sense a deeper one.

12:20.365 --> 12:22.731
These are all
fucking Agron's people.

12:24.035 --> 12:27.653
Our forces have doubled
in a single day...

12:29.624 --> 12:32.411
with people that are no stranger
to battle and blood.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.501
And whom
will they follow?

12:40.051 --> 12:42.212
( crows cawing )

12:46.557 --> 12:50.425
l detected a hint of movement
in your hips this time...

12:53.356 --> 12:54.937
a subtle thrust...

12:57.110 --> 12:59.567
as l bore down.

12:59.737 --> 13:02.945
You begin to enjoy
my cock inside of you?

13:03.950 --> 13:06.282
I would have answer.

13:08.204 --> 13:09.785
Yes.

13:09.956 --> 13:12.368
Yes...

13:12.542 --> 13:14.123
what?

13:16.796 --> 13:18.878
Yes, Dominus.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.502
Has a man ever heard

13:25.680 --> 13:27.671
so sweet a sound?

13:29.183 --> 13:30.468
Your voice,

13:36.482 --> 13:39.098
the warmth of your thighs--

13:41.154 --> 13:44.146
little wonder Quintus fell
beneath your spell,

13:44.324 --> 13:47.987
lavishing you
with affection and gifts.

13:49.912 --> 13:52.904
You call me Dominus now
in his place.

13:54.792 --> 13:57.124
It is only just

13:57.295 --> 13:59.957
that I present you
with something in return.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.516
How did you come by
such bounty?

14:14.562 --> 14:17.019
They were freely given
by the dead

14:17.190 --> 14:19.101
who no longer have
need for them.

14:19.275 --> 14:20.890
( chuckles )

14:22.695 --> 14:24.526
When this chest is full,

14:24.697 --> 14:28.610
its worth shall see Ashur
to even greater heights.

14:30.370 --> 14:33.203
Yet...

14:33.373 --> 14:36.865
for one such as you--

14:42.215 --> 14:44.376
something purchased
with coin.

14:55.353 --> 14:58.686
I know how fond Quintus was
of the color.

14:58.856 --> 15:01.142
I would have you wear it...

15:04.195 --> 15:07.232
so that I may look up to you
upon the balcony...

15:09.659 --> 15:12.071
and know that you're mine.

15:20.795 --> 15:22.911
Glaber: Heart has been
deeply wounded.

15:23.089 --> 15:25.751
If there is anything to offer as balm,
you need but voice it.

15:27.844 --> 15:29.835
Did you take command
of his men?

15:30.012 --> 15:31.752
Idid.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.968
Would that he had given them
freely in life,

15:35.143 --> 15:37.259
Spartacus would be
a distant memory

15:37.437 --> 15:39.268
and my brother
yet by my side.

15:39.439 --> 15:42.431
If only it had been so,

15:42.608 --> 15:44.564
my father would yet
grace this world

15:44.735 --> 15:48.444
and my slave would have had
no cause to be crucified.

15:48.614 --> 15:51.276
( man shouting commands)

15:51.451 --> 15:53.658
Your brother's men arrive.

15:53.828 --> 15:55.238
- Come.
- Man: Open the gate!

15:55.413 --> 15:57.199
Let us review them

15:57.373 --> 16:00.957
and bind them to cause
with oath of loyalty.

16:09.177 --> 16:11.168
Fall to attention!

16:13.973 --> 16:15.474
( horse neighs)

16:21.606 --> 16:23.312
Hold tongue.

16:23.483 --> 16:24.973
Give attention.

16:29.238 --> 16:30.978
Who stands forth
as your voice?

16:31.157 --> 16:33.148
Octavius Tarsus.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.612
I stand for them.

16:35.786 --> 16:37.822
Your benefactor

16:37.997 --> 16:41.706
has been ripped from this world
by the villain Spartacus.

16:41.876 --> 16:45.494
Towards his end,
| conscript you and your men

16:45.671 --> 16:49.380
into the army
of Gaius Claudius Glaber.

16:49.550 --> 16:52.917
Recite the sacramentum
and commit loyalty.

17:04.106 --> 17:06.142
swear by
Jupiter Optimus Maximus

17:06.317 --> 17:08.808
that I shall uphold
and defend the Republic.

17:08.986 --> 17:12.103
I swear to have her enemies
as my enemies

17:12.281 --> 17:13.896
and her friends
as my friends.

17:14.075 --> 17:15.656
You've taken
to your old color.

17:15.826 --> 17:17.441
Octavius: I pledge to defend
the Republic...

17:17.620 --> 17:18.700
I fear it no longer
suits me.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.702
Octavius: ...and her honor
with all my thoughts,

17:20.873 --> 17:22.864
my words and actions.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.998
I pledge my body and life
to the Republic

17:25.169 --> 17:27.000
and to its army
under the leadership

17:27.171 --> 17:29.207
of Praetor Gaius Claudius Glaber.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.043
Will they be enough?

17:31.217 --> 17:33.333
Added to my own troops, yes.

17:34.971 --> 17:37.553
They will be enough
to bring Spartacus to justice.

17:37.723 --> 17:40.135
I do not seekjustice.

17:41.644 --> 17:43.680
I seek vengeance.

17:43.854 --> 17:46.812
The man who took the life of my brother
must die the same,

17:46.983 --> 17:48.723
in blood and slaughter.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.438
Octavius: ...have all those held
close to heart.

17:51.612 --> 17:54.729
By Jupiter Optimus Maximus,
I so swear.

17:54.907 --> 17:57.398
Soldiers:
By Jupiter Optimus Maximus,

17:57.577 --> 17:59.238
we 50 swear.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.744
Set camp
outside these walls.

18:01.914 --> 18:05.202
Salvius will see you
to orders...

18:06.210 --> 18:07.916
( quietly )
and the death of Spartacus.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.623
Salvius: You are
Glaber's men now.

18:09.797 --> 18:11.662
Gratitude for your kindness.

18:11.841 --> 18:13.547
Salvius: Fall to attention.

18:13.718 --> 18:15.254
Know that
l have treasured it.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.043
Salvius: Move out.

18:18.431 --> 18:22.344
Perhaps it would be best
if you made home here

18:22.518 --> 18:23.928
beneath our roof.

18:24.103 --> 18:27.095
I leave in the morning
for my uncle's villa in Pompeii.

18:27.273 --> 18:28.934
I would not have you
upon the road

18:29.108 --> 18:32.100
while the threat of Spartacus
still remains.

18:32.278 --> 18:35.395
I'll send word to you uncle,
if you find solace in the thought.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.116
Your presence
offers great comfort.

18:48.294 --> 18:51.786
I am blessed
to find myself among you.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.626
Come, let us
make arrangements.

19:09.857 --> 19:13.691
Was it so recent
that I thought him weak?

19:16.030 --> 19:19.147
I know gaze into his eyes

19:19.325 --> 19:22.032
and tremble
at what lurks behind them.

19:23.162 --> 19:26.029
Do not work yourself into
an unfortunate state.

19:26.207 --> 19:27.287
Your child--

19:27.458 --> 19:29.073
Is the only reason
I yet live.

19:29.251 --> 19:33.494
Nothing I do pleases him.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.914
He tortures me
for what I have done--

19:36.092 --> 19:39.630
Decila crucified,
Seppia invited into our house,

19:39.804 --> 19:41.294
the way he looks at her.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.510
I would see myself over cliff

19:49.689 --> 19:51.850
if this is all
fate now holds.

19:52.024 --> 19:55.858
My heart would follow
to the rocks below.

19:57.780 --> 19:59.645
I cannot live like this.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.024
Nor l.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.528
( people chattering )

20:14.088 --> 20:15.453
The last of our meat.

20:15.631 --> 20:17.963
| forgot how much my kind
devour upon a sitting.

20:18.968 --> 20:21.334
Much seems to have
slipped mind of late.

20:25.850 --> 20:29.058
You sent me to scout Neapolis
and report on opportunity.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.389
That ship provided it.

20:31.564 --> 20:34.397
Were there any others
that may have afforded the same?

20:34.567 --> 20:36.023
Two--

20:36.193 --> 20:39.435
one from Damascus,
the other Gallia.

20:39.613 --> 20:41.069
News I would have cared
to know.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.731
Would it have made difference?
Men from Damascus

20:43.909 --> 20:45.570
are of low quality
and even lower trust.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.485
And Gallia?

20:50.499 --> 20:53.081
I would not have these ranks
filled with Gauls.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.412
Crixus...

20:54.587 --> 20:57.420
Is an honorable man.

20:59.925 --> 21:02.587
I will take your brothers to hunt
when day breaks

21:02.762 --> 21:05.094
to replenish supply,

21:05.264 --> 21:07.095
gauge how we might
come together.

21:07.266 --> 21:10.884
And tell those who are able
to speak in common tongue

21:11.061 --> 21:13.393
so that all among us
may know their thoughts.

21:13.564 --> 21:15.805
They will prove great asset.

21:17.318 --> 21:19.149
I give you my word.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.829
You fucking cunt.

21:31.999 --> 21:34.160
Nothing is free.

21:47.598 --> 21:49.805
I heard you were dead,

21:49.975 --> 21:51.806
carried to the afterlife
with all the others

21:51.977 --> 21:53.808
that fell beneath the arena.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.765
l yet breathe.

21:55.940 --> 21:58.682
My purse, however,
has suffered fatal blow.

21:59.985 --> 22:01.816
l have no coin
to pry open thighs.

22:05.241 --> 22:08.153
A miracle lacking profit

22:08.327 --> 22:10.363
for you and your master.

22:15.042 --> 22:17.579
Do you recall what it was like
to have one

22:17.753 --> 22:19.209
before you gained
your freedom?

22:19.380 --> 22:21.336
No man is ever truly free.

22:22.508 --> 22:24.624
( whispers )
Except for Spartacus

22:24.802 --> 22:26.963
and those who follow him.

22:27.972 --> 22:30.008
Did you see him
when he attacked the arena?

22:31.308 --> 22:32.423
What form of man was he?

22:32.601 --> 22:34.512
You speak of dangerous things.

22:34.687 --> 22:36.518
I'm not the only one.

22:36.689 --> 22:39.681
There's talk among many of us
toward joining his cause.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.565
There is no cause,

22:41.735 --> 22:44.943
only the leading of innocent fools
to their deaths.

22:49.410 --> 22:51.526
You have no coin then?

22:51.704 --> 22:54.696
A few denarii for passage
away from this fucking city.

22:57.042 --> 22:59.749
Strike Spartacus
from your thoughts

22:59.920 --> 23:01.660
and come with me.

23:02.715 --> 23:05.297
Ashur:
The mighty Gannicus.

23:05.467 --> 23:07.844
(chuckling)

23:10.222 --> 23:13.430
It is joyous occasion

23:13.601 --> 23:15.842
to find you yet alive,

23:16.020 --> 23:19.137
with ripe offering
perched upon lap.

23:21.233 --> 23:22.643
Apologies.

23:22.818 --> 23:25.855
It is unforgivable
to come between man and cunt,

23:26.030 --> 23:29.067
yet I must have words
with my brother.

23:36.415 --> 23:38.326
( exhales )

23:38.500 --> 23:40.752
An enticing creature.

23:40.920 --> 23:44.208
Of course you never lack
the attention of fine women.

23:44.381 --> 23:46.872
If you seek words,
break them and be done.

23:47.051 --> 23:50.964
The years have not seen you
to better manners.

23:51.138 --> 23:52.639
Noryou
to better company.

23:54.558 --> 23:56.594
I would advise caution.

23:56.769 --> 24:00.432
These men are the hand
of Praetor Gaius Claudius Glaber.

24:00.606 --> 24:02.847
Oh, and what are you?

24:03.025 --> 24:05.266
His cock or his ass?

24:06.278 --> 24:07.814
( chuckles )

24:08.906 --> 24:11.113
lam his will...

24:14.453 --> 24:16.819
bound by duty
to restore order.

24:16.997 --> 24:18.988
By nailing little girls
to the cross?

24:19.166 --> 24:22.329
Any slaves who whisper
of Spartacus and his rebellion...

24:24.171 --> 24:26.036
shall find place beside her.

24:26.215 --> 24:28.126
l have no interest
in whispers,

24:28.300 --> 24:30.541
nor the will
of your praetor.

24:32.304 --> 24:34.886
Old words from a slave.

24:39.603 --> 24:41.639
lam a free man.

24:42.982 --> 24:44.313
Yes.

24:44.483 --> 24:48.101
l was there upon the sands
when you became

24:48.278 --> 24:50.269
a god of the arena.

24:55.995 --> 24:59.032
It was a sight
never to be forgotten,

24:59.206 --> 25:02.323
Gannicus besting
20 gladiators

25:02.501 --> 25:04.913
in the primus
of the opening day.

25:10.843 --> 25:14.051
And his reward--
the rudis,

25:14.221 --> 25:16.837
a wooden sword carved
with the legend of his victories,

25:17.016 --> 25:20.224
proof of freedom

25:20.394 --> 25:23.386
demanded by adoring crowd.

25:23.564 --> 25:25.850
Show them.

25:26.025 --> 25:27.856
I am sure
they would be eager

25:28.027 --> 25:30.643
to lay eyes
upon such rare marvel.

25:32.448 --> 25:33.483
No?

25:33.657 --> 25:35.443
You do not have it
upon you?

25:35.617 --> 25:37.278
You know I do not.

25:39.371 --> 25:41.487
As I know

25:41.665 --> 25:43.701
the praetor
will be most pleased

25:43.876 --> 25:45.867
with the presence
of your company.

25:56.513 --> 25:59.801
| find it surprising
that you are still of this world,

25:59.975 --> 26:02.261
more so that you did not
think it wise

26:02.436 --> 26:04.722
to present yourself
at sooner convenience.

26:04.897 --> 26:07.263
Apologies.

26:09.902 --> 26:12.769
Gannicus has always been
a man of few words.

26:12.946 --> 26:17.235
Yet he favors the magistrate
with whole sentences, I'm told.

26:18.494 --> 26:21.827
I sought only
to conclude business.

26:21.997 --> 26:23.328
You aim too low.

26:23.499 --> 26:27.242
Spartacus brings the arena
down upon you,

26:27.419 --> 26:28.579
and yet here you stand,

26:28.754 --> 26:31.996
a phoenix
risen from its ashes.

26:33.717 --> 26:35.753
The gods have truly
blessed him.

26:35.928 --> 26:38.419
Glaber:
As they now bless me

26:38.597 --> 26:40.588
with his presence.

26:43.102 --> 26:45.093
l was moved

26:45.270 --> 26:48.228
by the reaction of the crowd
when you stepped upon the sands,

26:48.398 --> 26:50.980
the swell of their voices
heralding your name,

26:51.151 --> 26:53.608
filling the air with hope.

26:55.072 --> 26:58.064
Even tarnished by blood
and calamity,

26:58.242 --> 27:00.449
such a thing

27:00.619 --> 27:02.610
yet can hold value.

27:05.791 --> 27:08.498
Your rudis.

27:09.628 --> 27:11.289
And its price?

27:11.463 --> 27:13.454
A simple oath

27:13.632 --> 27:15.463
pledging yourself
to my command.

27:18.679 --> 27:20.965
Lucretia

27:21.140 --> 27:23.973
was also once thought
victim of Spartacus

27:24.143 --> 27:26.384
yet now stands
a powerful symbol

27:26.562 --> 27:29.474
used to calm
swelling concern.

27:29.648 --> 27:31.980
I would add you as such--

27:32.151 --> 27:35.268
a former slave
of the House of Batiatus

27:35.445 --> 27:38.653
now sworn to bring
errant brothers to justice.

27:38.824 --> 27:40.985
It appears you already have
one of those.

27:43.453 --> 27:46.069
Ashur's talents
are of the shadows.

27:46.248 --> 27:48.614
I would present you
in glorious light,

27:48.792 --> 27:50.373
at the front of my troops

27:50.544 --> 27:53.035
to the roar of the crowd
once again.

27:53.213 --> 27:56.501
And if! no longer crave
for such clamor?

28:10.564 --> 28:11.895
You're a free man.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.937
Your fate is your own.

28:26.121 --> 28:28.863
I will send for you again
in a few days

28:29.041 --> 28:32.829
and expect reasonable decision
to accompany you.

28:34.713 --> 28:36.328
Praeto r.

28:39.968 --> 28:41.708
Forgive me, Praetor.

28:41.887 --> 28:44.594
Gannicus cannot be trusted.

28:44.765 --> 28:46.801
Same once said of you,

28:46.975 --> 28:49.933
yet here you stand.

28:54.274 --> 28:55.935
See one of your men
to follow.

28:56.109 --> 29:00.193
lf Gannicus attempts
to leave Capua,

29:00.364 --> 29:02.480
crucify him.

29:10.040 --> 29:11.780
Perhaps Gannicus
was right.

29:12.918 --> 29:15.580
Those closest are of greater concern
than the Romans.

29:15.754 --> 29:18.587
Agron has aided cause
many times.

29:18.757 --> 29:21.123
His sport of simple truth
less common.

29:22.344 --> 29:24.835
"An angry young boy,
pissing on all those about him"--

29:25.013 --> 29:26.674
were those not your words?

29:29.768 --> 29:32.601
You know I hold Agron
in affection.

29:36.942 --> 29:39.729
Yet we must always be
cauﬁous.

29:41.738 --> 29:43.774
Chadara is a lesson
not to be forgotten.

29:55.711 --> 29:57.997
You did what you had to.

29:58.171 --> 30:00.548
She left you absent choice.

30:02.926 --> 30:06.043
I pray Agron presents you
better option.

30:09.474 --> 30:11.305
Is there no other way?

30:11.476 --> 30:13.341
Lucretia:
You were right about Gaius.

30:13.520 --> 30:16.933
The man he was no longer peers
from behind his eyes.

30:18.942 --> 30:22.184
He will not be swayed
by words or gentle touch.

30:24.323 --> 30:27.565
Only blood
can set us free now.

30:28.618 --> 30:30.609
Lucretia.

30:32.664 --> 30:35.326
It will hurt
but for a moment.

30:49.598 --> 30:51.839
Lift your dress.

30:57.689 --> 30:59.225
NeapoHs?

30:59.399 --> 31:02.562
A slaver ship was set upon, carrying
prisoners captured east of the Rhine.

31:02.736 --> 31:05.193
Warriors to aid
Spartacus's cause.

31:05.364 --> 31:06.695
An obvious conclusion.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.730
Dispatch men to Neapolis.

31:08.909 --> 31:12.197
Question anyone who may have seen
where they were headed after liberation.

31:12.371 --> 31:13.861
Praeto r.

31:17.209 --> 31:18.415
Gaius.

31:20.462 --> 31:23.204
Fetch the medicus, quickly!

31:24.716 --> 31:26.832
Lucretia: llithyia?

31:29.805 --> 31:31.386
What has happened to her?

31:31.556 --> 31:34.047
It is a sign from the gods,

31:34.226 --> 31:38.014
one carried by the child
yet to breathe life.

31:38.188 --> 31:39.177
And its meaning?

31:39.356 --> 31:42.564
Your heir will die
if it remains in a city

31:42.734 --> 31:44.816
cursed with blood and fear.

31:48.323 --> 31:51.907
I will have her carried to Rome
as soon as she's able,

31:52.077 --> 31:55.285
with trusted guard
to watch over her at all times

31:55.455 --> 31:56.695
till my return.

31:56.873 --> 31:59.125
I shall accompany her
and tend to her needs.

32:00.419 --> 32:01.704
Shh.

32:01.878 --> 32:04.164
Apologies, Praetor.

32:04.339 --> 32:07.923
Lucretia's a dear friend
to your wife

32:08.093 --> 32:10.334
yet offers greater comfort
to Capua.

32:10.512 --> 32:13.128
I fear the people
will fall to despair

32:13.306 --> 32:16.264
absent her divine presence.

32:16.435 --> 32:19.017
Wise counsel.

32:19.187 --> 32:21.803
Have your presence
known tomorrow in the market.

32:21.982 --> 32:23.563
Ease mind of our city

32:23.733 --> 32:25.348
and continue to assure them

32:25.527 --> 32:27.768
the gods favor my efforts.

32:38.790 --> 32:40.405
(birds chirping)

32:40.584 --> 32:42.370
We have been training
those freed of bond,

32:42.544 --> 32:45.456
yet none among us ever held
title of Doctore.

32:46.631 --> 32:50.294
l have no knowledge
of soldiers and the war.

32:50.469 --> 32:52.630
I know only
the ways of a gladiator.

32:52.804 --> 32:55.136
I can think of no fiercer army
so instructed.

32:56.975 --> 33:00.718
Open their eyes to what a man
can do given cause.

33:01.771 --> 33:03.682
As you have opened mine.

33:09.321 --> 33:11.482
l hunt with Agron
and his people

33:11.656 --> 33:13.396
to better gauge them.

33:13.575 --> 33:15.566
I will lend aid
when | return.

33:16.870 --> 33:18.201
I fear you hunt alone.

33:18.371 --> 33:20.828
Agron left with the others
before light broke.

33:24.503 --> 33:26.994
( crowd chattering, laughing )

33:28.381 --> 33:29.666
Spartacus: Agron.

33:35.388 --> 33:36.673
You hunt without me...

33:37.974 --> 33:40.511
when you knew
my intention.

33:40.685 --> 33:43.677
They woke before the sun and were eager
to take advantage of freedom.

33:47.859 --> 33:50.771
( laughter)

33:52.781 --> 33:55.523
We hunt, catch meat.

33:55.700 --> 33:57.531
And Roman drink!

33:57.702 --> 33:59.613
( cheering )

34:01.248 --> 34:04.115
I did not know this forest
was stocked with such.

34:04.292 --> 34:05.953
Where did you come by this?

34:06.127 --> 34:08.038
Awagon along the road.

34:08.213 --> 34:10.249
You attack the road

34:10.423 --> 34:12.709
so close to our position,
absent proper weapons?

34:16.096 --> 34:18.382
No one see.
All dead.

34:28.942 --> 34:31.103
(men laughing)

34:33.530 --> 34:35.771
I'm glad I risked my life
for this lot.

34:35.949 --> 34:37.485
They see us
to proper force.

34:37.659 --> 34:39.741
They see us to nothing
but discovery.

34:39.911 --> 34:41.367
Let the Romans come.

34:41.538 --> 34:43.403
l tire of hiding
like fucking rabbits.

34:43.582 --> 34:45.789
We are not ready
for a direct assault.

34:45.959 --> 34:47.665
Something even a child
could see.

34:48.962 --> 34:51.669
This child helped save you
from the arena

34:51.840 --> 34:53.922
and filled our numbers
with warriors.

34:54.092 --> 34:57.584
The pup has found himself nothing
but a pack of wild dogs.

34:59.097 --> 35:01.429
Ones that will never follow
a fucking Gaul.

35:06.605 --> 35:09.017
Apologies for leaving
without you.

35:16.281 --> 35:18.772
I question the boy's sincerity.

35:20.410 --> 35:22.901
Let us break meal
with our new brothers

35:23.079 --> 35:25.070
and attempt to settle this.

35:32.213 --> 35:34.420
May the gods bless you.

35:34.591 --> 35:36.172
May the gods
bless you.

35:36.343 --> 35:38.208
May the gods bless you.

35:47.479 --> 35:50.141
Hold the crowd back.
I would have words with Gannicus

35:50.315 --> 35:53.648
towards your praetor's desire.

36:10.168 --> 36:13.660
Woman's voice: There's talk among
many of us toward joining his cause.

36:18.468 --> 36:19.878
You knew her?

36:24.015 --> 36:25.175
Afoolish girl.

36:25.350 --> 36:28.012
She spoke too loudly of things
she should not have.

36:32.065 --> 36:34.898
The city is filled with ears

36:35.068 --> 36:37.525
straining for whispers
of betrayal.

36:39.030 --> 36:41.407
lt's filled with eyes as well.

36:48.873 --> 36:51.580
Attempt to leave the city
and share a cross beside your friend.

36:51.751 --> 36:53.707
( loudly )
lam not your slave.

36:54.713 --> 36:56.795
And lwill not bow
to your threats.

36:56.965 --> 36:58.375
Nor would I see you.

36:59.718 --> 37:02.380
The oracle of fucking riddles.

37:03.972 --> 37:05.382
Come to plain words.

37:05.557 --> 37:08.344
I saw something in your eyes

37:08.518 --> 37:10.224
when you stood before Glaber.

37:10.395 --> 37:14.388
I saw something beyond
a man weighing decision.

37:14.566 --> 37:18.275
The gods bless you with the gift
to see into my thoughts now, do they?

37:18.445 --> 37:20.026
More like her will die.

37:20.196 --> 37:22.778
The guilty, the innocent--
there will stand no difference

37:22.949 --> 37:27.067
when caught between Glaber's wrath
and Spartacus's vengeance.

37:27.245 --> 37:29.702
And what would you
have me do?

37:31.082 --> 37:32.788
Take up offer

37:32.959 --> 37:35.917
and turn on those
that I once called brother?

37:36.087 --> 37:37.748
No.

37:39.716 --> 37:43.800
I would have you end the life
of Gaius Claudius Glaber.

37:54.272 --> 37:56.934
He is desperate to claim
Spartacus's life,

37:57.108 --> 37:58.723
so consumed
that he now stands

37:58.902 --> 38:00.938
more a threat
than the Thracian himself.

38:01.112 --> 38:02.943
And what difference
would it make?

38:03.114 --> 38:05.355
Rome would only send another
to take his place.

38:05.533 --> 38:08.149
Spartacus blames Glaber
for part in his wife's death.

38:08.328 --> 38:10.944
Remove him from the world

38:11.122 --> 38:13.238
and the scales of blood
will be balanced.

38:13.416 --> 38:16.123
Spartacus will drift
from Rome.

38:16.294 --> 38:18.785
No one's life will be lost
on either side.

38:21.925 --> 38:23.790
Glaber's own wife

38:23.968 --> 38:25.549
this very night
leaves for Rome,

38:25.720 --> 38:28.132
taking with her
half his personal guard

38:28.306 --> 38:30.513
to see her safely
from the city.

38:30.683 --> 38:33.641
I could distract any that remain
posted to the villa entry,

38:33.812 --> 38:36.178
giving opportunity
for a single man

38:36.356 --> 38:38.813
to take Glaber's life
while he sleeps

38:38.983 --> 38:42.271
and Spartacus
to receive the blame.

38:42.445 --> 38:44.026
You have lost mind.

38:44.197 --> 38:47.234
The whole world
has slipped from reason.

38:47.408 --> 38:49.273
I seek only to restore it.

38:49.452 --> 38:50.692
( men chattering )

38:50.870 --> 38:52.371
Man: Move aside.

38:54.332 --> 38:56.789
Rid yourself of Ashur's man.

38:58.127 --> 39:01.836
When moon stands highest,
I will see path cleared.

39:03.842 --> 39:06.049
Choose to set upon it...

39:07.345 --> 39:11.179
or see legions fall
to pointless suffering.

39:20.775 --> 39:23.187
( men chattering )

39:25.405 --> 39:27.191
( cheering )

40:08.406 --> 40:10.772
Yeah!

40:12.619 --> 40:14.610
Your people-- they lift spirits.

40:17.415 --> 40:19.827
Not all are so moved.

40:42.941 --> 40:44.932
Perhaps they'll kill each other

40:45.109 --> 40:47.100
and give proper cause
for celebration.

40:48.613 --> 40:50.729
You are an impossible man.

40:50.907 --> 40:53.023
Something you've always known.

40:53.201 --> 40:55.192
And chose to ignore...

40:56.287 --> 40:59.029
to better see the man
beneath his faults.

40:59.207 --> 41:01.664
What if you had found
nothing of worth

41:01.834 --> 41:03.790
when the veil was pierced?

41:08.132 --> 41:10.123
(man singing)

41:15.181 --> 41:17.342
(crowd singing)

41:21.980 --> 41:25.017
Sing with me, my dark brother,
and share my women.

41:25.191 --> 41:26.977
I know not your words.

41:27.151 --> 41:28.766
Ah, Lugo will teach.

41:31.114 --> 41:33.605
(crowd continues singing )

41:35.785 --> 41:38.276
Mira: Oenomaus finds himself
assaulted.

41:39.747 --> 41:42.033
They are a boisterous people.

41:42.208 --> 41:45.291
Sometimes wine and foolishness
are needed

41:45.461 --> 41:48.328
to forger stronger bond.

41:49.590 --> 41:50.625
Sing with me.

41:50.800 --> 41:53.462
Now is not the time
for such things.

41:55.304 --> 41:56.885
Is it ever?

42:00.393 --> 42:01.553
No.

42:03.604 --> 42:06.596
I'll try and wrest a drink
from Lugo.

42:06.774 --> 42:08.810
for us to share

42:08.985 --> 42:11.021
and in the act

42:11.195 --> 42:13.026
aid Oenomaus in escape.

42:16.409 --> 42:18.024
( horses neigh )

42:35.219 --> 42:37.801
I tried to convince him
to let you come.

42:37.972 --> 42:39.428
He would not be moved.

42:39.599 --> 42:42.432
It's a thing of no matter.

42:51.360 --> 42:53.567
What you have done for me.

42:53.738 --> 42:56.150
Would that we were
never parted.

42:57.492 --> 43:00.074
You shall find me again
to your arms...

43:01.996 --> 43:03.452
sooner than expected.

43:03.623 --> 43:07.912
l sway Gannicus to forever remove
Gaius from concern.

43:11.506 --> 43:13.747
When it is done,
I will raise clamor

43:13.925 --> 43:16.416
and see Gannicus follow
to the afterlife.

43:19.931 --> 43:22.889
llithyia, it's time.

43:40.618 --> 43:42.233
Gaius...

44:08.062 --> 44:10.678
you shall be missed.

44:27.790 --> 44:30.167
(crowd singing)

44:31.669 --> 44:34.001
(women laughing, chattering )

44:47.852 --> 44:50.309
Wine, we share.

44:50.479 --> 44:53.516
Gratitude, but Crixus awaits.

44:53.691 --> 44:55.352
Ah, the Gaul.

44:55.526 --> 44:59.519
Yes, | see his eyes at me--

44:59.697 --> 45:01.198
nolove.

45:02.700 --> 45:04.031
He needs time.

45:04.202 --> 45:05.533
And drink.

45:07.747 --> 45:09.283
|wi|| tell him.

45:11.000 --> 45:14.993
Tell him
his eyes I not like.

45:15.171 --> 45:17.207
Your eyes better.

45:20.593 --> 45:22.129
Let me pass.

45:22.303 --> 45:23.634
( chuckles )

45:25.389 --> 45:28.131
( Naevia exclaims )

45:31.896 --> 45:33.887
( screams )

45:50.748 --> 45:52.579
( crowd exclaiming )

46:08.432 --> 46:10.423
Naevia: Crixus.

46:13.938 --> 46:16.224
SeduHus.

46:19.610 --> 46:22.477
SeduHus!

46:26.325 --> 46:27.485
Yeah!

46:58.649 --> 46:59.934
Calm yourselves.

47:50.409 --> 47:51.910
Spartacus!

48:14.433 --> 48:15.934
Enough!

48:22.900 --> 48:24.686
Is this what you are--

48:25.694 --> 48:27.605
animals

48:27.780 --> 48:29.771
demanding slaughter?

48:32.993 --> 48:34.369
We give you freedom

48:34.537 --> 48:37.324
and you repay it
with blood and dishonor.

48:41.127 --> 48:45.245
If you cannot stand among us
as trusted brother,

48:45.423 --> 48:48.790
if you cannot follow
my orders...

48:53.514 --> 48:55.800
take leave now

48:55.975 --> 48:58.637
orjoin Sedullus in death.

49:06.193 --> 49:08.980
I follow Spartacus.

49:09.155 --> 49:11.441
lcall no man my kin

49:11.615 --> 49:13.480
that does not stand so.

49:31.844 --> 49:34.256
The man that killed Sedullus...

49:37.683 --> 49:40.675
is great warrior.

49:41.687 --> 49:44.474
And Lugo follow.

53:25.411 --> 53:27.117
Salvius: Praetor,

53:27.287 --> 53:29.243
pressing concerns.

53:53.313 --> 53:54.814
( horses neigh )

54:36.315 --> 54:38.397
(women whimpering )

54:50.287 --> 54:51.788
( llithyia screams )

55:08.263 --> 55:10.879
Gannicus.

55:11.058 --> 55:13.174
has made his decision.

55:21.360 --> 55:23.351
(theme music playing )
