01:21.648 --> 01:23.817
- Hoorah.
- Hoorah!

01:31.524 --> 01:33.294
Over here!

01:33.427 --> 01:35.963
<i>Paxton, we need you in here.</i>

01:36.097 --> 01:37.664
On my way, sir.

01:44.005 --> 01:45.638
Morning, sir!

01:46.639 --> 01:48.675
Come on,
let's help load up.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.212
Yo.

01:56.350 --> 01:57.784
Keep practicing.

01:57.918 --> 01:59.954
There it is. Thanks, man.

02:01.389 --> 02:02.856
Commander, sir!

02:03.457 --> 02:04.891
Captain.

02:07.361 --> 02:10.163
- You sure?
- It's coming from the top.

02:10.297 --> 02:12.866
Somebody's pet project
in Washington.

02:15.403 --> 02:19.140
They negotiated passage with ISIS.
They won't be in your way.

02:19.273 --> 02:22.410
This medical equipment
needs to get there soon.

02:22.542 --> 02:25.112
Children are dying
as we speak.

02:25.246 --> 02:26.746
Copy that, sir.

02:28.648 --> 02:31.185
- Be safe.
- I'll try.

02:31.318 --> 02:34.121
Let's rally up, guys.
We're headin' out.

02:34.255 --> 02:35.523
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

02:36.490 --> 02:39.793
- Pinto, could you grab my vest?
- <i>Copy.</i>

02:55.910 --> 02:58.145
- Here you go, sir.
- Good lookin' out.

03:00.414 --> 03:02.383
- Hey, Younes!
- Brother.

03:03.050 --> 03:04.884
- Good to see you.
- Same here.

03:05.019 --> 03:06.719
Good to have you
with us.

03:06.853 --> 03:08.489
- How have you been?
- Good.

03:08.621 --> 03:11.192
It's choppy waters
we're navigating today.

03:12.592 --> 03:14.828
- No easy dame.
- No.

03:14.962 --> 03:17.797
- Stay crispy, my friend, on the road.
- Stay safe.

03:24.371 --> 03:27.374
Let's go, ladies!
Time to make the donuts!

03:27.508 --> 03:28.976
Chop chop!

06:00.928 --> 06:03.464
We need backup here!

06:14.541 --> 06:16.843
Cover me!

06:22.049 --> 06:23.217
Are you all right?

06:23.350 --> 06:24.817
We're gonna
get you out of here.

06:24.952 --> 06:27.388
Okay? We're gonna
get you out of here.

06:27.521 --> 06:29.423
You ready? Let's go!

06:40.833 --> 06:42.202
Baby?

06:42.703 --> 06:44.505
Brad. Hey.

06:46.540 --> 06:48.442
Brad, it's Kate.
You're home, okay?

06:50.810 --> 06:53.514
Hey.

06:55.115 --> 06:57.217
Hey.

07:04.191 --> 07:06.960
Brad. Brad.

07:49.903 --> 07:52.039
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:57.745 --> 07:59.446
- Coffee?
- Mm.

08:00.247 --> 08:02.383
- Thank you.
- Yes.

08:16.196 --> 08:18.031
You wanna talk about it?

08:25.839 --> 08:27.541
- Hey, kiddo.
- Good morning.

08:27.674 --> 08:29.777
- Hey, baby girl.
- Good morning.

08:29.910 --> 08:31.678
I missed you.

08:31.812 --> 08:34.381
Missed you too, love bug.

08:34.515 --> 08:36.750
I made your favorite breakfast
this morning.

08:36.884 --> 08:38.452
Yes!

08:38.585 --> 08:39.653
Pancake.

08:39.787 --> 08:43.256
- Pancakes.
- Pancake.

08:44.057 --> 08:45.893
- Oh!
- Get your own!

08:46.026 --> 08:49.363
Oh, my God, this is so good.

08:49.496 --> 08:51.632
Dad, are you taking me
to school today?

08:51.765 --> 08:54.435
Today and every day.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.505
Pancake?

08:59.740 --> 09:01.175
Please.

09:19.193 --> 09:21.295
- Yeah, yeah, what's up?
- What's up?

09:26.166 --> 09:29.102
Give me two.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.571
Give me three.

09:31.505 --> 09:33.607
- Ho!
- Not bad for an old man.

09:34.374 --> 09:35.642
- Hey, son.
- Hey.

09:35.776 --> 09:38.178
Come here.
Let me kick your baby ass.

09:38.312 --> 09:39.713
What's up, champ?

09:40.681 --> 09:42.683
- I'm good.
- You look good, man.

09:44.084 --> 09:47.721
- Ooh. Let's do it.
- All right.

09:49.356 --> 09:51.124
Come on, son,
show me what you got.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.726
All right. Give me two.

09:54.394 --> 09:56.263
What's going on with you?

09:56.396 --> 09:58.465
You're hitting like a little girl.

09:58.599 --> 10:00.734
I'm just warming up,
Pop, come on.

10:00.868 --> 10:03.270
Son, jab cross. Come on.

10:03.403 --> 10:06.540
There you go.
Listen, son, I'm your father.

10:06.673 --> 10:08.442
Yeah, someone
told me that.

10:08.575 --> 10:11.111
I also happen to know what I'm
talking about. Give me two.

10:11.245 --> 10:14.147
Look, those nightmares
you're having?

10:14.281 --> 10:16.083
They ain't going away,
all right?

10:16.216 --> 10:18.652
You need to do something
about them. All right?

10:18.785 --> 10:21.321
These things can
shut you down like that.

10:21.889 --> 10:24.391
Deeper than you know. Okay?

10:24.525 --> 10:28.128
And you need to let someone...
me, somebody... help you.

10:28.262 --> 10:29.830
Can you do that? Huh?

10:29.964 --> 10:32.733
Pop,
I... I'm fine, okay?

10:32.866 --> 10:34.301
All right,
give me two.

10:35.904 --> 10:37.337
Give me two. Come on!

10:37.471 --> 10:40.474
Okay, and anything
can trigger, all right?

10:40.607 --> 10:42.175
- I won't let it happen.
- All right.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.311
Give me two. Come on.

10:44.444 --> 10:46.813
There you go. All right.

10:46.948 --> 10:48.615
And another thing, son...

10:48.749 --> 10:51.953
Hey, I'm not gonna come into
the ring and talk about my wife.

10:52.119 --> 10:53.687
Give me two. Oh!

10:53.820 --> 10:58.425
All right, look. Listen,
Kate, she's a great mother.

10:58.559 --> 11:00.995
- She's taken a lot on.
- Come on, Pop.

11:01.128 --> 11:03.597
And for her sake, trust me.

11:03.730 --> 11:07.067
- Yeah.
- Respect her love for you.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.102
Can you do that?

11:09.236 --> 11:11.505
- Yeah.
- Okay. That's my boy.

11:11.638 --> 11:14.541
- Yes, sir.
- All right, show me what you got! What you got!

11:14.675 --> 11:17.912
Ho! Ho! That's my boy!
Give me two.

11:18.046 --> 11:19.279
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!

11:19.413 --> 11:21.348
Ho!

11:21.481 --> 11:23.550
What you got,
what you got, what you got?

11:28.188 --> 11:30.757
<i>Okay. And...</i>

11:30.891 --> 11:33.427
we saved the best for last.

11:33.560 --> 11:36.263
In Morocco, on the edge
of the Sahara desert,

11:36.396 --> 11:39.266
near what is now
the Algerian border,

11:39.399 --> 11:41.368
a team of archaeologists

11:41.501 --> 11:43.938
were exploring the depths
of an abandoned mine

11:44.072 --> 11:47.708
when they came across
something incredible.

11:48.442 --> 11:52.479
315,000-year-old human bones...

11:52.613 --> 11:57.150
...which shake the foundation of human history to its core.

11:57.284 --> 12:00.687
Because scientific research
has believed that human origins

12:00.821 --> 12:05.359
started 200,000 years ago,
and in eastern Africa.

12:05.492 --> 12:08.261
So it was believed
that humanity spread out

12:08.395 --> 12:09.964
and then populated the world.

12:10.098 --> 12:14.102
But this discovery in Morocco
is changing all of that.

12:14.234 --> 12:17.905
It's making us examine
our belief of where and when

12:18.039 --> 12:21.042
humans first walked on Earth.

12:21.174 --> 12:22.843
So...

12:22.977 --> 12:26.948
I contacted my friends at NASA,
and I asked for their help.

12:27.081 --> 12:29.783
And this is what we found.

12:33.754 --> 12:36.423
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is without a doubt

12:36.556 --> 12:39.526
that we have found
a large, ancient city

12:39.660 --> 12:42.997
of unknown origin
under the desert.

12:43.131 --> 12:44.598
Now, I've been working closely

12:44.731 --> 12:46.767
with the Moroccan
antiquity authorities,

12:46.900 --> 12:51.238
and I am proud to say that
myself and my team here

12:51.371 --> 12:54.675
have been granted access
to excavate.

13:30.744 --> 13:33.047
Hey. Stay with me!

13:33.181 --> 13:34.648
Stay with me, come on!

13:34.781 --> 13:36.249
Younes!

13:38.518 --> 13:41.321
Younes! Take him
and get back to the base.

13:41.455 --> 13:44.192
They don't want us, they just want
the meds and the doctors, all right?

13:44.324 --> 13:47.894
- I'm not leaving you here!
- Get back to the base and get me some backup!

13:51.999 --> 13:54.768
<i>The President awarded
the country's highest military honor...</i>

13:54.902 --> 13:57.370
- Hey, Clair. Come on.
- <i>...to Marine Corps Captain Bradley Paxton,</i>

13:57.504 --> 13:59.272
<i>who, while serving in Syria...</i>

13:59.406 --> 14:02.910
- Sit with your grandpa!
- <i>...held back a military ISIS ambush.</i>

14:03.044 --> 14:05.512
- <i>You were lying on the ground...</i>
- That's my son.

14:06.246 --> 14:08.983
<i>...half-dead. What then?</i>

14:09.117 --> 14:11.852
- <i>I saw my wife...</i>
- Kate, come. Come sit with us.

14:11.986 --> 14:14.688
<i>And I knew I'd be in trouble if
I didn't get myself back home...</i>

14:14.821 --> 14:16.958
Yeah. Yeah, just give me
one sec, okay?

14:17.091 --> 14:19.093
<i>...so I hung in there.</i>

14:19.227 --> 14:20.560
<i>Thankfully.</i>

14:20.694 --> 14:22.262
It's good to see
you walking again, man.

14:22.395 --> 14:23.931
I'll always be grateful.

14:24.065 --> 14:25.933
You know, you saved my life.

14:26.067 --> 14:28.869
Don't mention it.
You would've done the same for me.

14:30.804 --> 14:33.241
Give me a minute
with my old lady.

14:33.373 --> 14:34.674
Thanks, man.

14:36.144 --> 14:38.512
- Hi, mama bear.
- Hiya.

14:39.247 --> 14:40.514
Hey.

14:43.450 --> 14:45.253
Who are all these people
in my house?

14:48.522 --> 14:50.824
They are all here for you.

14:53.360 --> 14:54.828
You okay?

15:02.469 --> 15:04.504
I just, um...

15:06.573 --> 15:09.010
I don't know
if it's necessarily...

15:11.045 --> 15:14.982
the right time for me
to leave, you know?

15:20.254 --> 15:21.956
I mean, I... I...

15:23.390 --> 15:25.458
I love my job.

15:26.726 --> 15:28.930
I just love you more.

15:32.399 --> 15:34.969
You gotta trust me here, okay?

15:37.437 --> 15:39.673
Okay, but you have
to promise me...

15:41.042 --> 15:42.676
that if you need me...

15:42.809 --> 15:45.612
at all, for any reason...
that you tell me.

15:45.745 --> 15:48.216
Because I will
drop everything,

15:48.348 --> 15:50.483
and I will come home.

15:52.920 --> 15:55.822
I promise.
Don't worry, okay?

15:57.959 --> 16:01.095
And besides, I'm not gonna
let you drop this

16:01.229 --> 16:03.530
so you can, what,
give the credit to someone else?

16:03.663 --> 16:06.267
Come on.

16:06.399 --> 16:08.802
This is gonna be great,
right?

16:10.670 --> 16:13.506
Yeah. Yeah,
it's gonna be good.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.575
Yes! Of course!

16:15.709 --> 16:19.180
And Morocco's beautiful.
You're gonna love it.

16:19.313 --> 16:22.049
I know. I've always been so
close, but I never got to go.

16:22.183 --> 16:24.986
Oh. You're gonna have
such a good time.

16:25.119 --> 16:27.587
And look, Clair-bear and I,

16:27.721 --> 16:30.891
we really need some
daddy-daughter time, you know?

16:31.259 --> 16:32.492
Yeah.

16:37.164 --> 16:40.400
Get these people out of my house.

17:39.226 --> 17:42.396
The worst game
I've ever seen in my life.

17:42.529 --> 17:46.934
<i>He's in for the score. Oh...</i>

17:47.068 --> 17:48.336
Oh, come on!

17:48.468 --> 17:52.006
What a bad play, man.

17:54.874 --> 17:57.945
Your mom's calling.

17:58.079 --> 17:59.579
Hey, babe.

17:59.713 --> 18:01.983
- How's the trip going?
- <i>Good, I, uh...</i>

18:02.116 --> 18:04.684
I'm just getting
everything unpacked now.

18:04.818 --> 18:06.954
But you're right, it's...

18:07.088 --> 18:10.057
- it's so beautiful here, it's insane.
- <i>I told you.</i>

18:10.992 --> 18:13.526
- Hey, Mom.
- Hi, Kate!

18:13.660 --> 18:15.895
Hey, kiddo! Hey, Ed.

18:16.030 --> 18:17.797
How are you guys?
What are you guys doin'?

18:17.932 --> 18:20.633
We're building an ancient
site with Grandpa.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.769
- That sounds amazing.
- <i>You okay?</i>

18:22.903 --> 18:24.804
What's it like over there?

18:25.872 --> 18:28.209
It's beautiful. It is...

18:28.342 --> 18:30.677
It's something I've never seen before.
It's just...

18:30.810 --> 18:33.180
Okay, Mom, gotta go.
Bye. Love you.

18:33.314 --> 18:36.083
Oh, she's busy.

18:36.217 --> 18:38.486
She's only 11, and she doesn't
even care about me anymore.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.653
That's not true.
She misses you.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.289
We all miss you.

18:42.822 --> 18:44.524
I miss you too.

18:44.657 --> 18:46.860
<i>Are you okay?</i>

18:47.594 --> 18:48.996
I'm good.

18:51.999 --> 18:54.534
I'll call you before
I go to bed, okay?

18:54.667 --> 18:56.803
- <i>Okay, do that.</i>
- I love you.

18:56.937 --> 18:58.805
<i>Love you more.</i>

19:29.403 --> 19:30.504
Miss Paxton.

19:31.871 --> 19:34.874
I'm Jean Rashidi.
It's such a pleasure to finally meet you.

19:35.009 --> 19:37.244
The pleasure is all mine,
Mr. Rashidi.

19:38.045 --> 19:40.814
- Please. Call me Jean.
- Jean. I mean...

19:40.948 --> 19:44.418
What a find. This is incredible.
Congratulations.

19:44.552 --> 19:45.986
Thank you.
My colleagues and I

19:46.120 --> 19:48.422
haven't had this much
excitement in years.

19:48.556 --> 19:50.623
We are honored
to be part of this.

19:50.757 --> 19:53.961
I mean, the feeling is mutual.
I can't wait to get out there.

19:54.095 --> 19:56.564
- Jean. Mrs. Paxton.
- Mr. Achour.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.933
Thank you so much
for the hospitality.

19:59.066 --> 20:00.767
- This is incredible.
- It's a pleasure.

20:00.900 --> 20:03.636
Let me introduce you to
your Moroccan counterpart.

20:03.770 --> 20:06.873
This is Amir Jadid.
He will be your scout leader.

20:07.007 --> 20:09.243
Anything you need,
anywhere you want to go.

20:09.376 --> 20:10.911
Oh. Thank you.

20:11.045 --> 20:13.981
I'm of course at your disposal.
Just a phone call away.

20:21.922 --> 20:24.925
- Mrs. Paxton?
- Yeah.

20:25.059 --> 20:28.195
- Hakim Zaydane. Chief of Police.
- Nice to meet you, Chief.

20:28.329 --> 20:30.965
Have we, uh, done
something wrong already?

20:31.098 --> 20:32.899
No, no, of course not. No.

20:33.033 --> 20:36.604
I'm here on behalf of my
superior, Mr. Younes Laalej.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.105
Is he our
government liaison?

20:38.239 --> 20:40.407
No, no, but you're gonna
be meeting her shortly.

20:42.076 --> 20:44.578
Mr. Laalej has been serving
with your husband,

20:44.711 --> 20:47.647
and he asked me to watch over
you during the coming week.

20:47.780 --> 20:51.986
So please don't hesitate to call
me at any time, day or night.

20:52.119 --> 20:54.654
- Thank Mr. Laalej in Rabat for me.
- I will.

20:54.787 --> 20:57.224
- Good luck, madam.
- Thank you.

21:12.540 --> 21:14.441
- Mrs. Paxton?
- Yeah.

21:14.575 --> 21:16.743
Hi. My name is
Dina Mansouri.

21:16.876 --> 21:18.745
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

21:18.878 --> 21:20.614
- Shall we go?
- Yeah.

22:32.553 --> 22:34.722
The ancient city
should be around here.

22:36.023 --> 22:39.693
Okay. All right. Well, obviously,
safety is our first priority,

22:39.826 --> 22:41.161
but let's get
as close as we can

22:41.295 --> 22:43.163
so we can establish
our parameters

22:43.297 --> 22:45.499
and compare them
against the sat imagery.

22:46.533 --> 22:47.935
Okay. Follow me, guys.

23:17.797 --> 23:21.635
We are very close to the border.
We have to be careful.

23:21.769 --> 23:24.238
Okay. Just let me know.

23:41.488 --> 23:43.957
This is as close
as we can get.

23:45.993 --> 23:47.594
I think we should go back.

23:49.129 --> 23:51.398
Kate, I agree. I think
we should start the dig

23:51.532 --> 23:54.568
on the other side of the city
wall and work our way here.

23:54.702 --> 23:57.870
It might take years
before we get here, anyway.

24:09.783 --> 24:11.385
What's happening?

24:14.722 --> 24:16.123
Hey. What's going on?

24:16.256 --> 24:18.359
We're in Algeria.

24:33.907 --> 24:36.110
What the fuck is going on?

24:38.946 --> 24:40.781
- We have to go!
- Come on!

24:43.317 --> 24:45.719
Come on!
We have to go! Now!

24:47.887 --> 24:49.590
No! No!

24:49.723 --> 24:52.493
No!

24:52.626 --> 24:55.829
- Don't move! Hands up!
- Please don't shoot! Please!

24:55.963 --> 24:57.765
- Hands up!
- Please! Don't!

24:57.897 --> 25:00.033
Don't shoot! Please.

25:00.167 --> 25:02.903
Please don't shoot.

25:56.690 --> 25:58.559
We didn't mean to cross
the border, okay?

25:58.692 --> 26:01.295
- It was an accident.
- Shut up, woman!

27:02.055 --> 27:05.125
Get back to the base and get me some backup!

27:05.259 --> 27:06.660
Fuck!

27:09.429 --> 27:11.632
We need backup.
We're getting hammered here.

27:44.064 --> 27:45.265
Younes.

27:45.399 --> 27:49.369
Brad... I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

27:50.203 --> 27:51.505
Kate.

27:53.307 --> 27:55.609
- She has been abducted.
- <i>What?</i>

27:55.742 --> 27:57.711
- <i>Just an hour ago.</i>
- Where?

27:57.844 --> 27:59.112
<i>Daesh.</i>

27:59.246 --> 28:00.881
She's in Algeria.

28:01.015 --> 28:03.784
Younes, how the fuck could this
have happened in less than 24 hours?

28:03.918 --> 28:05.252
<i>We had all eyes on them.</i>

28:05.385 --> 28:07.989
One of my men was even killed
trying to rescue her,

28:08.155 --> 28:09.723
as well as her
government liaison.

28:09.856 --> 28:12.626
<i>Kate was seen taken alive
with two others.</i>

28:14.062 --> 28:15.862
I'm on the first flight out.

28:47.160 --> 28:49.063
Hey, Dad.

28:49.196 --> 28:50.597
Hey, baby girl.

28:50.731 --> 28:52.899
Are you going
to work again?

28:54.068 --> 28:55.602
Yes.

28:55.736 --> 28:57.404
Okay.

28:57.537 --> 29:00.374
But Pop Pop will
be here shortly, okay?

29:00.507 --> 29:02.509
He'll take care
of everything.

29:08.116 --> 29:09.750
I'll be back soon.

31:04.999 --> 31:08.735
Welcome to Algeria.
What are you doing here?

31:10.537 --> 31:12.305
We didn't mean
to cross the border.

31:12.439 --> 31:14.175
I am on a dig
that is sanctioned

31:14.307 --> 31:16.309
by the Moroccan government. I...

31:16.443 --> 31:18.045
You are spy!

31:18.179 --> 31:19.947
No. No, I am not a spy.

31:20.081 --> 31:22.349
I... I am an archaeologist.

31:39.967 --> 31:41.501
What's your name?

31:42.702 --> 31:44.771
My name is Kate Paxton.

31:44.906 --> 31:46.606
Kate Paxton.

31:48.142 --> 31:50.811
- And you?
- Amir.

31:50.945 --> 31:52.013
Speak up!

31:52.546 --> 31:55.116
Amir Jadid.

31:55.249 --> 31:56.650
Moroccan?

31:57.784 --> 31:59.352
Yes.

32:05.859 --> 32:07.061
And you.

32:08.595 --> 32:09.896
Jean Rashidi, sir.

33:20.134 --> 33:21.401
- Paxton, brother.
- Younes.

33:21.534 --> 33:22.937
Tell me something
about these guys.

33:23.070 --> 33:24.704
These people are
some fringe group,

33:24.838 --> 33:26.640
just recently pledged
allegiance to ISIS.

33:26.773 --> 33:28.608
We know very little
about them.

33:29.476 --> 33:30.777
The Moroccan government liaison

33:30.912 --> 33:32.914
must have missed
the borderline with Algeria.

33:33.047 --> 33:35.016
It can easily happen
when you walk this river.

33:35.149 --> 33:38.319
Then they show up out of nowhere the
minute Kate and her team crossed.

33:38.451 --> 33:40.887
- Security breach.
- Most likely, yes.

33:41.554 --> 33:43.823
- Any leads?
- The driver.

33:43.958 --> 33:47.128
He was driving Kate's vehicle.
He's nowhere to be found.

34:10.717 --> 34:11.885
Get in.

34:15.056 --> 34:16.523
Put it there.

34:32.139 --> 34:33.806
What's wrong with you?

34:33.940 --> 34:36.143
Are you pregnant?

34:38.179 --> 34:39.347
Answer my question!

34:39.478 --> 34:43.016
No. No, I'm not.

35:07.607 --> 35:08.976
Eat your food.

35:09.642 --> 35:11.345
- I'll watch you.
- Hey.

35:11.479 --> 35:13.047
Hey, you speak English?

35:13.713 --> 35:15.615
I learned from
American movies.

35:15.749 --> 35:17.550
What's your, uh...

35:18.585 --> 35:20.587
What's your favorite
movie star?

35:22.223 --> 35:23.823
Jackie Chan.

35:23.958 --> 35:27.594
That's a good choice.
He's mine, too.

35:29.130 --> 35:32.632
- What's your name?
- Uh, my name is Omar.

35:33.533 --> 35:35.369
Omar, I'm Kate.

35:35.503 --> 35:37.171
It's really nice to meet you.

35:43.477 --> 35:45.112
Do you know where
my friends are?

35:48.516 --> 35:49.917
In other rooms.

35:51.751 --> 35:53.154
Are they okay?

35:54.321 --> 35:56.856
Yes. For now.

35:58.459 --> 35:59.859
Okay.

36:05.266 --> 36:06.633
Be quiet.

36:06.766 --> 36:08.701
Hey, be quiet.

36:08.835 --> 36:10.804
Don't bring attention
to you.

36:10.938 --> 36:14.108
Okay? I'm gonna
bring you some water.

36:26.153 --> 36:29.457
<i>The age-old Sahara conflict
between Morocco and Algeria</i>

36:29.589 --> 36:31.959
<i>is front and center,
especially now,</i>

36:32.093 --> 36:35.262
<i>with a crucial vote in the UN
scheduled for next week.</i>

36:35.396 --> 36:38.332
<i>What do we know about the vote
and this conflict?</i>

36:38.466 --> 36:40.767
<i>For most of us, it's the first
we've heard of it.</i>

36:40.900 --> 36:43.471
Yes?

36:43.603 --> 36:46.307
<i>Mr. Tom Fitzgerald
is here to see you, sir.</i>

36:46.440 --> 36:49.609
Send him in.

36:50.710 --> 36:52.012
Come in, Fitzy.

36:54.949 --> 36:56.217
It's good to see you.

36:56.350 --> 36:57.518
Good to see you.

36:57.650 --> 36:59.619
Smells good in here.
Cubans?

36:59.752 --> 37:01.821
- State secret, really.
- Uh-huh.

37:03.623 --> 37:06.427
Fitzy...
that UN vote next week,

37:06.560 --> 37:09.997
if it favors Morocco,
the American and British oil companies

37:10.131 --> 37:12.566
will be able to keep
drilling in Moroccan Sahara.

37:12.699 --> 37:14.168
And considering
what just happened

37:14.301 --> 37:17.138
and the fact that it happened
in Algerian territory,

37:17.271 --> 37:19.540
the majority of the vote
is gonna favor Morocco,

37:19.672 --> 37:22.109
which in effect
will create a...

37:22.243 --> 37:25.112
what you might call
an epic win for Big Oil.

37:26.046 --> 37:28.182
Quite the coincidence?

37:28.315 --> 37:30.717
Hmm. Indeed.

37:30.850 --> 37:34.888
So, they're here.
We should discuss our approach?

37:37.258 --> 37:38.658
Our approach.

37:39.792 --> 37:42.096
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thank you.

37:42.630 --> 37:43.964
More for me.

37:44.932 --> 37:48.569
You know, when my wife
and I transferred here,

37:48.701 --> 37:50.304
we were very excited...

37:53.073 --> 37:55.042
...once we left Pakistan.

37:56.076 --> 37:58.745
We were looking for a quieter,
more peaceful place

37:58.878 --> 38:01.315
and perhaps some weekends
in Marrakech.

38:01.448 --> 38:03.050
And instead...

38:03.184 --> 38:05.619
we got a different part
of the same jungle.

38:05.752 --> 38:07.054
Cheers.

38:07.820 --> 38:09.722
So, Captain Paxton.

38:11.458 --> 38:12.792
He's very concerned.

38:12.927 --> 38:14.694
He also works for
Globe Security Group.

38:14.827 --> 38:16.931
- He's a hostage negotiator.
- One of the best.

38:17.064 --> 38:21.035
He was responsible for the release
of those students in Nigeria,

38:21.168 --> 38:23.304
and that was no small feat.

38:24.171 --> 38:25.973
We can't have him involved
in this, Earl.

38:26.106 --> 38:29.009
Under no circumstances.

38:34.248 --> 38:36.749
I've read
the rule book, Fitzy.

38:38.519 --> 38:42.656
Nevertheless, I'm excited
to meet him, so...

38:42.789 --> 38:45.659
I suggest...
I just won't let him in.

38:45.792 --> 38:47.061
Hmm?

38:47.894 --> 38:49.330
Of course.

38:50.965 --> 38:52.466
- Elizabeth.
- <i>Sir?</i>

38:52.600 --> 38:55.302
Show, uh, Captain Paxton
and the others in, please.

38:55.436 --> 38:56.769
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

39:01.242 --> 39:02.742
- Chief Sekkat.
- Ambassador.

39:02.875 --> 39:06.046
Ah, Captain Paxton.
What an honor it is to meet you, sir.

39:06.180 --> 39:07.880
Honor is mine, Ambassador.

39:08.015 --> 39:10.718
I'm truly sorry that it's under
these terrible circumstances.

39:10.850 --> 39:12.119
Thank you, sir.

39:12.253 --> 39:14.121
- Younes.
- Ambassador.

39:14.255 --> 39:17.157
Honor to meet you, Captain.
Tom Fitzgerald.

39:17.291 --> 39:19.326
- Section chief.
- Honor, sir.

39:19.460 --> 39:20.494
- Younes.
- Fitz.

39:21.962 --> 39:24.732
Our government has allowed
Captain Paxton to join in.

39:24.864 --> 39:27.167
He will be included
in all our joint meetings.

39:27.301 --> 39:29.536
Sorry, Captain and Younes,

39:29.670 --> 39:32.339
but, uh, there's
a matter of clearance.

39:32.473 --> 39:34.041
I'll have to speak
to Washington.

39:34.174 --> 39:36.977
Captain Paxton has been granted
clearance on our side.

39:40.780 --> 39:42.383
Uh, Chief. Ma'am.

39:42.516 --> 39:45.885
You know that US government
policy does not allow

39:46.020 --> 39:47.688
relatives or friends
to participate...

39:47.820 --> 39:49.423
Mr. Fitzgerald.

39:49.556 --> 39:52.092
We expect full cooperation
between our governments.

39:53.160 --> 39:56.230
Captain Paxton is now
a part of our task force.

39:56.363 --> 39:57.830
Let's get
this briefing going.

39:57.965 --> 40:00.301
I agree.
Please, have a seat.

40:08.942 --> 40:11.178
Well, we know
that the hostages

40:11.312 --> 40:13.113
are in Algeria,
we just don't know where.

40:13.247 --> 40:14.948
We also know
that the Algerians

40:15.082 --> 40:17.918
are as pissed off
about this as we are,

40:18.052 --> 40:20.054
and I see as a first step

40:20.187 --> 40:23.190
that we give 'em the time
to get intel on the ground.

40:23.324 --> 40:25.825
We all agree negotiation
is out of the question.

40:25.959 --> 40:29.330
The leader's name
is Jaafar El Hadi.

40:29.463 --> 40:32.966
He's been on Interpol's radar
for a couple of years now.

40:33.100 --> 40:35.369
Fitz, brief us.
What do we know about him?

40:35.502 --> 40:39.573
Well, El Hadi is French,
of Algerian origins,

40:39.707 --> 40:43.344
he's a wealthy businessman.
He likes money.

40:43.477 --> 40:45.779
He likes his picture
in the paper.

40:46.580 --> 40:49.083
He was radicalized
two years ago,

40:49.216 --> 40:52.553
bankrolled two attacks
in Paris.

40:52.686 --> 40:55.289
He has the means to have
a self-sufficient operation,

40:55.422 --> 40:57.958
gather followers
and buy weapons.

40:58.759 --> 41:00.494
We think he's ISIS-inspired.

41:01.061 --> 41:03.030
He wants their attention.

41:04.031 --> 41:05.833
Captain, thoughts?

41:05.966 --> 41:07.701
It's been 24 hours.

41:07.835 --> 41:11.071
We have not heard from El Hadi.
That is alarming.

41:12.239 --> 41:14.375
We need intel
on the ground now, sir,

41:14.508 --> 41:16.243
and not just
from the Algerians.

41:16.377 --> 41:18.579
Once we find him,
we can extract them.

41:19.813 --> 41:21.849
- A rescue mission.
- Yes, sir.

41:21.982 --> 41:25.452
They were taken to be beheaded.
They'll be dead within days.

41:26.453 --> 41:28.422
Well, the Algerians
are looking,

41:28.555 --> 41:31.358
and they're trying to gather
the intel that we need,

41:31.492 --> 41:35.329
because right now, I must
confess, we're operating blind.

41:36.296 --> 41:40.367
With all due respect,
Mr. Ambassador, sir...

41:40.501 --> 41:45.472
besides the Algerians, we have intel
superpowers right here at this table.

41:46.673 --> 41:48.509
We should be able
to find them.

41:48.642 --> 41:50.477
We should.

41:50.611 --> 41:52.045
Yes, sir.

41:53.280 --> 41:54.681
Okay, let's get on it.

42:00.921 --> 42:03.257
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

42:06.994 --> 42:09.630
- Can I get a spoon, please?
- Of course.

42:09.763 --> 42:10.864
- There you go.
- Thanks.

42:10.998 --> 42:13.233
There you go.

42:14.535 --> 42:16.970
<i>Your local news.</i>

42:17.104 --> 42:20.774
<i>Kate Paxton went to
Morocco to study this amazing discovery</i>

42:20.909 --> 42:24.311
<i>of human bones dating back
over 300,000 years</i>

42:24.445 --> 42:26.513
- <i>recently found in Morocco...</i>
- Hey, that's Mom!

42:26.647 --> 42:28.382
<i>...and it all happened
when her team</i>

42:28.515 --> 42:30.717
<i>accidentally crossed
the Algerian border.</i>

42:30.851 --> 42:34.021
Is she okay? What happened?

42:35.989 --> 42:37.458
Of course she is,
sweetheart.

42:37.591 --> 42:39.326
Give Grandpa
a moment, okay?

42:39.460 --> 42:40.594
Okay.

42:50.871 --> 42:53.474
<i>We've just
learned that the Islamic State</i>

42:53.607 --> 42:55.576
<i>has praised
the kidnapping today,</i>

42:55.709 --> 42:58.645
<i>citing it as a glorious
example of action,</i>

42:58.779 --> 43:00.747
<i>and reiterated
their call to arms</i>

43:00.881 --> 43:04.418
<i>by what they describe as
their "global army at large."</i>

43:04.551 --> 43:06.453
<i>The United States and Morocco</i>

43:06.587 --> 43:08.388
<i>reiterated
in separate statements</i>

43:08.522 --> 43:11.391
<i>they will not negotiate
with terrorists.</i>

43:12.559 --> 43:14.995
Fuck! Fuck!

43:15.128 --> 43:18.098
Fuck! Fuck!

43:30.711 --> 43:33.180
- Pop.
- <i>Son.</i>

43:33.313 --> 43:35.716
How's everything going?

43:35.849 --> 43:38.151
<i>It's going.</i>

43:38.285 --> 43:40.989
I know you're probably
up to something stupid.

43:41.121 --> 43:43.290
Yeah, you know me.

43:43.423 --> 43:46.226
- <i>Maybe I should come.</i>
- No, Pop, stay with Clair.

43:46.360 --> 43:49.196
She really needs you.
It's the best you can do.

43:50.430 --> 43:53.500
Keep your eyes open,
your mind sharp.

43:53.634 --> 43:54.902
Bring our Kate home.

43:55.035 --> 43:56.770
<i>Okay, son?</i>

43:57.771 --> 43:59.239
Yes, sir.

44:06.680 --> 44:08.815
<i>The Algerian Security Services</i>

44:08.950 --> 44:11.852
<i>are on the ground,
trying to find the location</i>

44:11.986 --> 44:15.222
<i>of the hostages
and their captors.</i>

44:15.355 --> 44:17.691
Get in.

46:22.749 --> 46:25.218
The woman who was killed,
Mrs. Mansouri,

46:25.352 --> 46:27.021
cleared Kate's driver.

46:27.155 --> 46:30.323
She was probably threatened.
I don't think she knew anything.

46:30.457 --> 46:32.060
We're questioning
the family.

46:32.192 --> 46:35.829
I need to get into Algeria,
and you're gonna help me.

46:35.963 --> 46:39.133
Paxton, brother, you're out of your mind.
Where will you go?

46:39.266 --> 46:42.103
El Hadi must be hiding in a place
where the Algerians aren't looking.

46:42.235 --> 46:43.870
They'll never find him.

46:44.906 --> 46:47.507
They'll kill Kate soon
if they haven't already.

46:54.214 --> 46:56.283
We have proof of life.

47:15.836 --> 47:18.072
I am Younes
Laalej, Senior Officer

47:18.206 --> 47:19.907
of His Majesty's
Bureau of Investigations.

47:20.041 --> 47:22.676
This is my superior,
Chief Sekkat.

47:22.809 --> 47:24.912
We are authorized
to speak with you.

47:27.447 --> 47:29.516
The hostages are alive.

47:30.617 --> 47:34.354
Okay, Amir, it is very important
that you listen to me now.

47:34.488 --> 47:37.491
How long was the drive
until they dropped you off?

47:37.624 --> 47:41.195
I don't remember. Uh...

47:41.929 --> 47:44.932
Think. Did it feel
like ten hours?

47:45.066 --> 47:46.600
Or three hours?

47:48.301 --> 47:49.736
<i>Ten.</i>

47:50.670 --> 47:52.974
Did you make any stops
along the way?

47:55.143 --> 47:56.911
<i>Maybe one. Yeah.</i>

47:59.080 --> 48:03.017
May... May I speak
with my family now?

48:03.151 --> 48:04.284
<i>Please.</i>

48:04.417 --> 48:06.020
Your family
will be waiting for you

48:06.154 --> 48:07.721
when you arrive here in Rabat.

48:07.854 --> 48:10.258
It is a long drive
to get here, Amir.

48:10.423 --> 48:11.993
so I want you
to take that time

48:12.126 --> 48:15.796
and try to think of
anything you can remember.

48:32.512 --> 48:34.148
Come with us!

48:34.282 --> 48:35.983
Please. Please. Please, I...

48:36.117 --> 48:38.920
- Hey! Shh!
- Please, I have a daughter.

48:39.053 --> 48:40.922
Look at me. Look at me!

48:41.055 --> 48:44.357
If you don't shut up,
he hits you. Okay?

48:44.491 --> 48:46.693
- You understand?
- Yeah.

48:46.827 --> 48:47.761
Go!

48:47.894 --> 48:49.496
Please...

49:28.702 --> 49:31.872
- No. No.
- Get down. Sit!

49:32.006 --> 49:33.440
Please, no.

49:33.573 --> 49:35.276
Please, I have a daughter.
I have a family...

49:41.282 --> 49:43.017
Please.

49:43.850 --> 49:45.253
Please, please, please!

49:48.722 --> 49:52.459
Please don't do this.
Please don't do this.

50:02.003 --> 50:03.703
Please.

50:48.950 --> 50:50.985
You didn't have
to do that.

50:52.320 --> 50:55.022
I would have gone if
you had just asked me to.

50:56.489 --> 50:58.159
You're a liar.

50:59.327 --> 51:03.596
You said to my colleague...
you were not pregnant.

51:04.698 --> 51:08.635
And here...
we don't like lies.

51:09.502 --> 51:11.571
Especially from women.

51:27.922 --> 51:29.522
I didn't know.

51:36.063 --> 51:38.765
What do you want from me?

51:44.704 --> 51:47.274
I want you to speak
to your government...

51:49.143 --> 51:52.313
and let them know
if they don't pay the ransom,

51:53.180 --> 51:55.449
Saturday night
after the evening prayer,

51:55.582 --> 51:58.919
you and your child
are going to die.

52:05.792 --> 52:07.761
Can I ask how much
I'm worth?

52:11.631 --> 52:13.267
Ten million dollars.

52:18.973 --> 52:22.876
What goes through your mind when you
kill a woman and her unborn child?

52:25.678 --> 52:29.050
I think of... all the kids,

52:29.183 --> 52:32.719
all the women,
all the innocent men,

52:32.852 --> 52:35.256
that your government
has killed.

52:50.538 --> 52:52.006
Oh, God.

53:21.502 --> 53:23.404
What's happening, Younes?

53:23.537 --> 53:25.206
We have yet
to debrief him.

53:28.042 --> 53:29.876
He was dropped off.

53:30.010 --> 53:33.447
Or rather, thrown off
a pickup truck.

53:33.581 --> 53:37.118
Tied up and gagged at a checkpoint
near our side of the border.

53:38.119 --> 53:40.287
He was instructed
to deliver proof of life.

53:40.421 --> 53:43.790
My guys drove him to Rabat,
and here we are.

53:44.757 --> 53:46.460
El Hadi wants a show.

53:47.328 --> 53:50.131
He wants mainstream
video coverage.

53:51.265 --> 53:53.000
There's no online videos yet?

53:53.733 --> 53:55.136
No, nothing yet.

53:56.504 --> 54:00.941
I mean, sending proof of life
with a hostage is so old school.

54:01.075 --> 54:03.043
It's like a fuckin' movie.

54:04.211 --> 54:06.213
They started
a livestream.

54:07.615 --> 54:09.550
It is therefore...

54:09.682 --> 54:11.619
we ask our respective
governments

54:11.751 --> 54:13.786
to pay the sum
of $10 million cash

54:13.921 --> 54:16.723
<i>for our safe release.</i>

54:16.856 --> 54:18.926
<i>Otherwise, we will
meet our death</i>

54:19.059 --> 54:22.129
<i>this Saturday after
the evening prayer.</i>

54:24.898 --> 54:26.000
Speak!

54:28.868 --> 54:31.505
<i>I would like
the US government to consider</i>

54:31.639 --> 54:35.376
that if they cause
my death...

54:36.776 --> 54:40.648
that it is also the death
of my unborn child,

54:40.780 --> 54:43.150
<i>as I am pregnant.</i>

55:07.341 --> 55:08.976
The hostage
said they drove him

55:09.109 --> 55:10.743
less than ten hours
to the border.

55:10.877 --> 55:12.680
They made one stop
along the way,

55:12.812 --> 55:14.714
probably to refuel.

55:14.847 --> 55:17.784
El Hadi's mother is from
Abadla, in Algeria.

55:17.918 --> 55:20.387
Small town.
Not very populated.

55:20.521 --> 55:22.456
Villages all around.

55:22.590 --> 55:25.960
How far is that town from the
border point where Kate was taken?

55:28.162 --> 55:30.397
I'd say at least
a seven-hour drive.

55:36.670 --> 55:37.870
Close enough.

55:43.277 --> 55:45.412
This is how
it looks from above.

55:46.981 --> 55:49.283
The image may be old.

55:49.416 --> 55:52.119
Are there any cell towers in that
area, any unusual activity?

55:52.253 --> 55:56.991
Nah, nothing unusual. We didn't
set up a proper comm surveillance.

55:59.526 --> 56:00.760
Can I get a copy of that?

56:00.893 --> 56:02.396
Roger that.

56:21.148 --> 56:22.416
Let's move out.

57:18.205 --> 57:21.175
Fall back, fall back!
Fall back, guys!

57:27.781 --> 57:29.383
You all right?

57:30.317 --> 57:32.486
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

57:38.292 --> 57:40.928
I want to thank you
for looking out for me.

57:41.362 --> 57:42.862
Of course.

57:42.996 --> 57:46.300
There's not a lot of people
I trust around here, you know?

57:53.540 --> 57:55.576
I really wanted to stay
that day back in Syria.

57:55.709 --> 57:57.244
Oh, man, don't...

57:57.911 --> 58:01.248
Yeah, not now.
Ancient history.

58:01.382 --> 58:04.084
That mission was doomed
from the start.

58:04.818 --> 58:06.787
Tell me about it.

58:06.920 --> 58:08.888
Don't beat yourself up
about it, man.

58:09.022 --> 58:11.158
Just part of the job, okay?

58:14.061 --> 58:15.662
This one's off the books.

59:07.080 --> 59:08.449
Wait a minute.

01:00:02.236 --> 01:00:04.171
I'm going in there
with you, Brad.

01:00:04.939 --> 01:00:07.207
That was not the deal.

01:00:08.342 --> 01:00:10.177
I owe you my life.

01:00:12.446 --> 01:00:14.615
I prefer to keep it
that way.

01:00:17.417 --> 01:00:19.753
You will never
make it alone.

01:00:21.755 --> 01:00:23.156
You need me.

01:00:44.778 --> 01:00:46.179
Are you all right?

01:00:49.316 --> 01:00:51.451
Can you handle
what's coming?

01:00:58.191 --> 01:01:01.528
I love this woman more than
anything in this world.

01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:05.632
I'll do whatever it takes.

01:01:56.516 --> 01:01:57.818
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

01:01:57.952 --> 01:01:59.820
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

01:02:03.757 --> 01:02:07.694
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

01:02:36.189 --> 01:02:37.557
Hey!

01:03:25.073 --> 01:03:28.408
Why do you tell me this?
What do you want from me?

01:03:28.542 --> 01:03:32.646
El Hadi is demanding a $10
million ransom to release some hostages.

01:03:32.779 --> 01:03:35.183
We don't think he needs
all of that money.

01:03:35.315 --> 01:03:37.185
His army's
not big enough.

01:03:37.317 --> 01:03:39.619
There are brothers all around the
world that can use some of that.

01:03:39.753 --> 01:03:41.588
We want to
negotiate with him...

01:03:41.722 --> 01:03:43.757
I have nothing
to do with this.

01:03:47.761 --> 01:03:49.163
Who are you?

01:03:49.296 --> 01:03:52.967
I am brother Abdur Raheem
Williams from Detroit, Michigan.

01:03:54.501 --> 01:03:57.905
How come I've never heard
about a brother from Detroit?

01:03:58.039 --> 01:04:00.240
I've traveled all around the
world in the name of our cause,

01:04:00.373 --> 01:04:03.978
but in America,
we operate quietly, as we must.

01:04:10.350 --> 01:04:12.086
Who sent you?

01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:14.155
The less you know,
the better.

01:04:14.956 --> 01:04:16.556
I'll make sure you
and your people

01:04:16.690 --> 01:04:18.658
are compensated
for your assistance.

01:04:18.792 --> 01:04:21.528
We need to send El Hadi
a message of our arrival,

01:04:21.661 --> 01:04:24.598
and we'd appreciate
transportation to get there.

01:04:55.163 --> 01:04:56.797
Come with me, please.

01:05:19.586 --> 01:05:23.690
I'm not helping you because you say
that you're Abdur Raheem Williams.

01:05:23.824 --> 01:05:26.127
I'll help you because
God gave you the gift

01:05:26.893 --> 01:05:29.230
to make
the difference...

01:05:29.362 --> 01:05:31.933
between the good
and the bad.

01:05:42.542 --> 01:05:43.810
You have our gratitude.

01:05:43.945 --> 01:05:45.980
Your help will always
be remembered.

01:05:48.182 --> 01:05:49.816
Please, um...

01:05:49.951 --> 01:05:52.086
Please accept this
for the mosque.

01:05:53.254 --> 01:05:55.056
For the car, at least.

01:06:09.170 --> 01:06:10.670
Mr. Williams...

01:06:11.438 --> 01:06:13.573
be careful.

01:06:13.707 --> 01:06:16.643
Those people have
nothing to do with Islam.

01:06:16.776 --> 01:06:19.080
I may very well be
sending you to your death.

01:06:19.213 --> 01:06:21.848
My cause is worthy
of my death.

01:06:40.201 --> 01:06:42.569
It should be
behind that tree.

01:06:45.373 --> 01:06:46.740
Got it!

01:06:58.518 --> 01:07:00.121
You were right.

01:07:00.254 --> 01:07:01.454
About what?

01:07:01.588 --> 01:07:03.257
You don't need me.

01:07:03.925 --> 01:07:05.993
You can do just fine
on your own.

01:07:06.860 --> 01:07:08.862
Well, we're not there yet.

01:07:10.331 --> 01:07:11.399
We're being followed.

01:07:11.531 --> 01:07:13.466
Or escorted.

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:16.503
We should have no trouble
finding El Hadi now.

01:07:16.636 --> 01:07:20.308
- How do you figure?
- Despite what the imam says,

01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:22.310
those men must work
for El Hadi.

01:07:22.442 --> 01:07:25.612
I'm sure they're trying to give him
a heads-up that we're on our way.

01:07:25.745 --> 01:07:28.448
Once we get to Abadla,
let's lose 'em...

01:07:29.317 --> 01:07:30.952
then we follow them.

01:09:03.978 --> 01:09:06.313
Well, hello, hello, hello.

01:09:07.915 --> 01:09:11.684
- That was almost too easy.
- Yeah.

01:09:15.555 --> 01:09:17.957
Thanks for the escort, guys.

01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:22.029
Let's get this party started.

01:09:30.938 --> 01:09:33.274
<i>Earl, I know
I'm stating the obvious,</i>

01:09:33.407 --> 01:09:35.443
<i>but we have exactly
two hours...</i>

01:09:35.575 --> 01:09:37.511
<i>two hours before
the execution</i>

01:09:37.644 --> 01:09:41.115
<i>of a pregnant, innocent American
woman and a French citizen.</i>

01:09:41.247 --> 01:09:43.649
<i>We have not
been able to get the Algerians</i>

01:09:43.783 --> 01:09:45.519
<i>to agree to anything.</i>

01:09:45.652 --> 01:09:48.189
They want our support in the UN
vote, but we cannot allow...

01:09:48.322 --> 01:09:51.325
Madam Secretary. Please.
I don't mean to interrupt,

01:09:51.459 --> 01:09:55.396
but the gentleman that we are
dealing with is batshit crazy.

01:09:55.529 --> 01:09:58.598
All he wants is for the US
to be on its knees

01:09:58.731 --> 01:10:00.434
and to get ISIS cred.

01:10:00.568 --> 01:10:02.735
And he has both,
so I suggest

01:10:02.869 --> 01:10:05.005
that we send in
the SEALs immediately.

01:10:05.139 --> 01:10:08.175
Uh, well, I'd give you
90% probability

01:10:08.309 --> 01:10:10.511
the Algerians
would try to stop us.

01:10:10.643 --> 01:10:12.046
Of course they will.

01:10:14.348 --> 01:10:17.084
Mr. President,
we're nowhere near ready

01:10:17.218 --> 01:10:18.751
<i>for a Title 50 operation.</i>

01:10:18.885 --> 01:10:21.255
- We don't have the intel.
- Yes, we do.

01:10:50.384 --> 01:10:51.619
Rogue assets?

01:10:51.751 --> 01:10:53.187
Who are they?
What are they doing?

01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:55.855
One of Morocco's
top secret agents

01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:58.492
and one of our own
have entered Algerian territory

01:10:58.626 --> 01:11:00.194
<i>to rescue the hostages.</i>

01:11:00.327 --> 01:11:01.794
One of our own? Who?

01:11:01.929 --> 01:11:04.731
Captain Brad Paxton.

01:11:04.864 --> 01:11:06.934
<i>Captain Paxton? The marine.</i>

01:11:07.067 --> 01:11:09.470
Yes. Kate Paxton
is his wife.

01:11:10.171 --> 01:11:11.804
Do we know
where they are?

01:11:11.939 --> 01:11:14.375
<i>They have located
the terrorist compound.</i>

01:11:14.508 --> 01:11:15.842
And how do we
know this?

01:11:15.976 --> 01:11:18.811
They're communicating
with Moroccan authorities.

01:11:18.946 --> 01:11:20.747
<i>Mr. President,</i>

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:23.417
there's not enough time here for
any kind of military response...

01:11:23.551 --> 01:11:26.220
Find out. Bring me
all tactical options.

01:11:31.358 --> 01:11:32.393
What do we got?

01:11:34.727 --> 01:11:37.031
I'd say 300 meters.

01:11:44.205 --> 01:11:46.373
We need all four
in four shots.

01:11:48.841 --> 01:11:50.277
Can you make it?

01:11:51.111 --> 01:11:53.347
I've been practicing
on the weekends.

01:12:02.822 --> 01:12:04.291
Clear.

01:12:52.273 --> 01:12:53.941
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

01:12:59.013 --> 01:13:00.914
<i>Allahu Akbar!</i>

01:13:51.231 --> 01:13:53.300
Keep your head down!

01:13:53.434 --> 01:13:55.202
Hey. Come on.

01:13:56.804 --> 01:13:58.372
Stay with me!

01:13:59.973 --> 01:14:01.841
Don't die on me!

01:14:12.885 --> 01:14:14.221
Are you okay?

01:14:44.485 --> 01:14:46.987
Okay, okay.

01:14:47.121 --> 01:14:49.523
Don't shoot.

01:14:51.658 --> 01:14:53.327
I shoot.

01:15:01.301 --> 01:15:03.537
Take me to the American woman.

01:15:19.686 --> 01:15:21.121
She's here.

01:15:37.404 --> 01:15:39.640
- Hey.
- Get off me! Please, stop!

01:15:39.773 --> 01:15:43.343
- Get off me! Get off me!
- It's me. It's me.

01:15:43.477 --> 01:15:46.046
I got you.
It's me. It's okay.

01:15:46.180 --> 01:15:48.115
- Oh, my God!
- It's okay.

01:15:49.416 --> 01:15:51.618
- You came.
- Did they hurt you?

01:15:51.752 --> 01:15:52.686
No.

01:15:52.820 --> 01:15:54.288
- Can you walk?
- Yeah.

01:15:54.421 --> 01:15:57.891
- Yeah, I can walk.
- All right.

01:15:58.025 --> 01:16:00.027
You remember
how to use this?

01:16:00.594 --> 01:16:01.962
Yeah.

01:16:06.633 --> 01:16:08.101
That's my girl.

01:16:08.235 --> 01:16:10.103
Look at me, all right?

01:16:10.237 --> 01:16:12.206
We're gonna get out of here.
We're going home.

01:16:12.339 --> 01:16:13.807
- Yeah.
- Stay right behind me.

01:16:13.942 --> 01:16:16.043
- Okay?
- Yeah.

01:17:12.799 --> 01:17:15.235
It's okay.
It's okay.

01:17:15.369 --> 01:17:18.338
All right now.
All right now.

01:17:18.472 --> 01:17:20.774
Stay with me.
Stay with me. Okay?

01:17:20.909 --> 01:17:22.209
Okay.

01:17:24.144 --> 01:17:25.679
You got this.

01:17:27.548 --> 01:17:29.483
Yeah. Yeah.

01:17:30.717 --> 01:17:32.719
I need you to stay
in this room.

01:17:32.853 --> 01:17:34.288
I need you
to stay quiet.

01:17:34.421 --> 01:17:36.857
- Yeah.
- I will be back for you.

01:17:37.424 --> 01:17:39.192
Okay.

01:17:48.036 --> 01:17:51.772
Sorry. Please.

01:17:52.506 --> 01:17:54.107
Don't shoot. Please.

01:17:58.645 --> 01:17:59.680
Go.

01:18:00.147 --> 01:18:01.381
Go.

01:19:36.877 --> 01:19:38.079
Our thoughts and prayers

01:19:38.211 --> 01:19:42.050
are with the family of
Mr. Jean Rashidi in Paris.

01:19:42.182 --> 01:19:44.551
This is a heartbreaking day.

01:19:44.685 --> 01:19:48.822
There is evil in this world.
But when we look it in the eye,

01:19:48.956 --> 01:19:52.192
when there's a knife
to our throats,

01:19:52.325 --> 01:19:54.162
we must remember
our own goodness

01:19:54.327 --> 01:19:56.563
and that of those
who have come before us.

01:19:56.697 --> 01:19:59.232
We must not,
and we will not,

01:19:59.366 --> 01:20:01.234
give up on our humanity.

01:20:01.368 --> 01:20:04.005
Mr. President, how do you feel

01:20:04.138 --> 01:20:07.541
about a pregnant American woman
being executed in two hours?

01:20:07.674 --> 01:20:10.377
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we are doing everything we can</i>

01:20:10.510 --> 01:20:12.980
<i>to work every diplomatic
channel known to us</i>

01:20:13.114 --> 01:20:16.883
<i>to save the lives of Mrs.
Paxton and her unborn child.</i>

01:20:17.018 --> 01:20:19.653
<i>That is all I can say
at this time.</i>

01:20:19.786 --> 01:20:22.322
<i>God bless
the United States of America,</i>

01:20:22.456 --> 01:20:24.291
<i>and God bless us all.</i>

01:20:25.492 --> 01:20:27.360
<i>Oil exports
from Afghanistan...</i>

01:20:27.494 --> 01:20:29.463
Looks like we're
going in for a rescue.

01:20:30.430 --> 01:20:32.100
How do you figure that?

01:20:32.232 --> 01:20:33.935
I know my president.

01:20:34.735 --> 01:20:36.903
Well, that's
highly risky.

01:20:39.239 --> 01:20:40.607
Not enough time.

01:20:40.741 --> 01:20:43.211
You don't have any real
recon, no real intel...

01:20:43.343 --> 01:20:45.846
We got what we need
from the Moroccans.

01:20:46.446 --> 01:20:47.814
You need to get up to speed.

01:20:47.949 --> 01:20:49.883
You kept me out
of that loop.

01:20:50.017 --> 01:20:51.418
That I did.

01:20:51.551 --> 01:20:53.121
Excuse me.

01:20:53.253 --> 01:20:56.389
The Algerian ambassador
is here waiting to see you.

01:20:56.523 --> 01:20:58.325
Thank you.

01:20:59.259 --> 01:21:01.728
The diplomacy clusterfuck
continues.

01:21:02.829 --> 01:21:06.533
Fitzy...
we are buying time,

01:21:06.666 --> 01:21:11.471
but you need to make sure that
Kate Paxton gets home safe.

01:21:11.605 --> 01:21:13.540
I'll do my best.

01:21:17.277 --> 01:21:19.013
Ah, Ambassador, welcome.

01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:27.121
<i>Sir?</i>

01:21:27.255 --> 01:21:28.722
Send the SEALs.

01:21:28.855 --> 01:21:31.358
Shoot to kill, and get
Kate Paxton out of there.

01:21:31.491 --> 01:21:33.027
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

01:21:46.207 --> 01:21:48.308
Take me to El Hadi.

01:22:03.423 --> 01:22:05.525
Better than yours.

01:22:11.565 --> 01:22:15.203
If you shoot me,
he will shoot you...

01:22:15.335 --> 01:22:17.404
and we all die together.

01:22:22.009 --> 01:22:23.844
Is that what you want?

01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:28.748
You want $10 million.

01:22:29.683 --> 01:22:31.751
We're here to
negotiate that for you.

01:22:37.891 --> 01:22:40.894
Then why are you here,
killing my men?

01:22:41.028 --> 01:22:42.629
Who are you?

01:22:44.098 --> 01:22:48.468
I'm Captain Brad Paxton.
Kate is my wife.

01:22:48.602 --> 01:22:50.938
We know you have
a bank account in Panama.

01:22:51.072 --> 01:22:55.009
We also know the code.
It can be transferred in a second.

01:22:57.078 --> 01:22:59.412
Then do it!

01:23:30.610 --> 01:23:31.913
Done.

01:23:54.434 --> 01:23:55.735
Jaafar.

01:24:12.386 --> 01:24:14.956
Go! Go! Go!

01:25:39.306 --> 01:25:41.242
Go, go, go!
Go, you guys, move!

01:25:46.981 --> 01:25:49.150
Captain Paxton?

01:25:49.283 --> 01:25:52.987
- Yeah.
- Captain Brody.

01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:55.655
What do you say we get
you and your family home?

01:25:55.789 --> 01:25:58.926
Damn skippy, Captain.
Let's go.

01:26:40.834 --> 01:26:42.536
Kate, baby,
our ride is here.

01:26:42.669 --> 01:26:44.305
Let's go, let's go,
let's go!

01:26:58.052 --> 01:27:00.020
- Watch your flank!
- Go!

01:27:00.154 --> 01:27:02.957
Go, go, go! I'm right behind you!

01:27:03.090 --> 01:27:05.092
- Brad!
- Take her and go!

01:27:05.226 --> 01:27:07.660
- Go, go, go, go!
- Brad!

01:28:13.693 --> 01:28:15.095
Thanks.

01:28:17.565 --> 01:28:18.798
Okay, let's go.

01:28:23.103 --> 01:28:24.737
- Let's go.
- Okay.

01:28:28.642 --> 01:28:31.011
- Brad! Brad!
- Come on!

01:28:35.149 --> 01:28:38.586
- Brad!
- Go, go, go!

01:28:38.718 --> 01:28:40.887
Brad!

01:28:41.388 --> 01:28:43.157
Brad! No!

01:28:43.290 --> 01:28:45.059
No...

01:29:56.796 --> 01:29:58.132
Katherine!

01:30:00.701 --> 01:30:02.169
Brad!

01:31:26.487 --> 01:31:29.323
- Good to see you, Amir.
- Mr. Fitz.

01:31:31.658 --> 01:31:33.227
Mr. Jadid.

01:31:33.927 --> 01:31:35.429
Can I offer you some tea?

01:31:35.562 --> 01:31:37.664
- No, thank you.
- Have a seat.

01:31:42.603 --> 01:31:45.139
I was not supposed
to be taken.

01:31:45.272 --> 01:31:46.907
That was not the deal.

01:31:48.342 --> 01:31:50.911
You were never
in any danger.

01:31:52.112 --> 01:31:54.047
And you handled it
very well,

01:31:54.181 --> 01:31:56.383
Amir, very well.

01:31:58.018 --> 01:32:00.487
Your rookie fear
notwithstanding.

01:32:04.158 --> 01:32:06.894
You're now an American citizen
and a CIA asset.

01:32:07.027 --> 01:32:09.663
You should be very,
very proud.

01:32:12.533 --> 01:32:13.667
Thank you.

01:32:35.722 --> 01:32:38.192
I do love seeing

01:32:38.325 --> 01:32:44.298
good old-fashioned CIA work
in action.

01:32:45.866 --> 01:32:47.634
There's nothin' like it.

01:32:49.203 --> 01:32:52.105
Two SEALs died
last night.

01:32:55.142 --> 01:32:58.312
Cost of American freedom.

01:32:58.445 --> 01:32:59.646
Mm-hmm.

01:33:03.250 --> 01:33:05.085
The ambassador.

01:33:07.254 --> 01:33:09.089
What about him?

01:33:12.259 --> 01:33:15.429
They suspect something.
The Moroccans do too.

01:33:20.667 --> 01:33:23.403
There are matters...

01:33:24.371 --> 01:33:26.673
kings, presidents...

01:33:27.341 --> 01:33:30.577
and ambassadors
better not...

01:33:32.947 --> 01:33:34.314
know.

01:33:38.018 --> 01:33:40.053
Let's make sure of that.
