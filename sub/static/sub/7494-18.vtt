WEBVTT

00:00.868 --> 00:02.670
Last time on Make It Pop...

00:02.703 --> 00:03.671
You kissed Caleb?

00:03.704 --> 00:04.738
We're a thing.

00:04.772 --> 00:06.740
You may wanna know why
he's hanging out with you.

00:06.774 --> 00:08.442
I was a... bet?

00:08.476 --> 00:09.077
(splat!)

00:09.110 --> 00:10.010
(splat!)

00:10.044 --> 00:11.179
(splat!)

00:11.212 --> 00:13.481
(shouting and laughing)

00:13.514 --> 00:15.183
Oz is history.

00:15.216 --> 00:15.783
(gasps)

00:16.517 --> 00:19.087
Who knew eggs
were so messy?

00:19.120 --> 00:21.722
Okay, I did, but--

00:21.755 --> 00:24.158
And who knew cleaning
was so much work?

00:24.192 --> 00:26.060
Well, I knew that too.

00:26.094 --> 00:28.262
Which is why I
never do it.

00:28.296 --> 00:30.731
And who knew I could
get detention?

00:30.764 --> 00:32.233
Not me.

00:32.266 --> 00:33.767
Not anyone.

00:33.801 --> 00:35.269
But definitely not me.

00:35.303 --> 00:36.904
This will build
your character.

00:36.937 --> 00:39.073
You make a mess,
you clean it up!

00:39.107 --> 00:41.175
I like my character
just like it is.

00:41.209 --> 00:41.875
Perfect!

00:41.909 --> 00:42.443
All done!

00:42.476 --> 00:45.913
(garbage splattering)

00:45.946 --> 00:46.747
Never mind.

00:48.449 --> 00:49.250
As you were.

00:50.284 --> 00:52.320
Look at this sweet,
innocent head cheerleader.

00:52.353 --> 00:53.954
Have you no remorse?

00:53.987 --> 00:57.525
I feel so lost Ms. Diona.

00:57.558 --> 01:00.761
How can I be found?

01:00.794 --> 01:01.429
Barf.

01:01.462 --> 01:02.563
Enough.

01:02.596 --> 01:06.167
Clean up and report for
detention tomorrow after school.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.268
Not you, Valerie.

01:07.301 --> 01:09.036
*

01:09.069 --> 01:10.070
Poor thing.

01:10.104 --> 01:12.906
*

01:12.940 --> 01:14.142
Detention begins.

01:14.175 --> 01:17.278
I want this room cleaned, remove
love letters from the walls

01:17.311 --> 01:19.347
and scrape gum from
under the desks.

01:19.380 --> 01:20.248
Ewwwww....

01:20.281 --> 01:21.782
Jodi, our manicures!

01:21.815 --> 01:23.184
No chit chat!

01:23.217 --> 01:25.986
Now, I have sent Corki
for some warm soapy water.

01:26.019 --> 01:27.855
May I help Corki
with the water?

01:27.888 --> 01:29.990
I've been told I have
the arm strength

01:30.023 --> 01:31.425
of an Eastern European
power lifter.

01:33.994 --> 01:36.430
Okay. I admit it.

01:36.464 --> 01:37.998
(deep breath)

01:38.031 --> 01:39.099
I made a mistake.

01:39.133 --> 01:40.268
(everyone gasps)

01:40.301 --> 01:42.236
What? I can admit
when I'm wrong.

01:42.270 --> 01:44.838
We should have pelted Valerie
with something easier to clean.

01:44.872 --> 01:45.373
Like soap.

01:45.406 --> 01:46.540
(everyone groans)

01:46.574 --> 01:48.976
Which as you mentioned,
Corki is fetching!

01:49.009 --> 01:51.011
We're sorry about
egging Valerie.

01:51.044 --> 01:52.546
Even though I'm
pretty sure she

01:52.580 --> 01:54.848
has a hyper-developed
mean gene--

01:54.882 --> 01:57.218
And she really,
really deserved it.

01:57.251 --> 01:59.353
You are all terrible
at apologizing.

02:00.388 --> 02:05.959
So while we may have overreacted
with Valerie just a teensy bit--

02:05.993 --> 02:08.362
--we'd like to do the show
first, then have detention.

02:08.396 --> 02:09.963
The play opens in three days.

02:09.997 --> 02:11.565
How do I say "no" to you?

02:11.599 --> 02:12.366
So you agree?

02:12.400 --> 02:13.434
No.

02:13.467 --> 02:15.936
I was looking for a
creative way to say "Forget it."

02:15.969 --> 02:16.870
Like "Nein,"

02:16.904 --> 02:17.438
"Nyet,"

02:17.471 --> 02:18.572
And "Uh-uh girl friend!"

02:18.606 --> 02:21.375
I don't think I'm exaggerating
when I say the school,

02:21.409 --> 02:24.011
nay, the WORLD,
needs to see this play.

02:24.044 --> 02:25.279
With me in it!

02:25.313 --> 02:27.147
Now that Mr. Stark
is on Broadway

02:27.181 --> 02:28.616
who will I harass
about casting?

02:28.649 --> 02:30.150
Enough!

02:30.184 --> 02:32.486
Let the gum cleaning begin.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.488
I thought the gum
fairies did that.

02:34.522 --> 02:36.056
Valerie, cell phones.

02:36.089 --> 02:37.925
I want you all
to reflect on

02:37.958 --> 02:40.528
what you've done to
your fellow student.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.637
Ms. Diona, can I stop by
your office later to discuss

02:49.670 --> 02:53.006
some fresh ideas
for the play?

02:53.040 --> 02:54.408
Of course Valerie.

02:57.911 --> 02:58.879
Get to it.

03:00.248 --> 03:01.882
I can't believe
we're stuck here.

03:01.915 --> 03:04.084
I can't believe Valerie
walked away with no blame.

03:04.117 --> 03:06.053
I can't believe
she took my phone.

03:06.086 --> 03:07.455
I can't believe I let her.

03:07.488 --> 03:10.958
I can't believe I haven't
texted in over two minutes!

03:10.991 --> 03:12.526
I need my phone!!!!

03:12.560 --> 03:13.794
Focus.

03:13.827 --> 03:16.530
We've worked too hard to have
this play taken away from us.

03:16.564 --> 03:20.000
And despite the obvious
injustice of me not being cast,

03:20.033 --> 03:22.303
We cannot let
Valerie take over!

03:22.336 --> 03:24.638
*

03:24.672 --> 03:26.139
* Make it pop,

03:26.173 --> 03:27.541
* Woo, woo

03:27.575 --> 03:29.109
* Make it pop,

03:29.142 --> 03:32.179
* Woo Woo,

03:32.212 --> 03:34.948
* I can't wait, No
I can't wait, *

03:34.982 --> 03:37.918
* No, I can't wait,
no, I can't wait. *

03:37.951 --> 03:39.453
* So make it pop,

03:39.487 --> 03:41.655
* We're bout to,
We're bout to blow, *

03:41.689 --> 03:43.257
* Wait till we drop,

03:43.291 --> 03:45.259
* Oh yeah, we're,
Ready to go, *

03:45.293 --> 03:46.294
* Ain't gonna stop,

03:46.327 --> 03:48.696
* When is it, time
for the show, *

03:48.729 --> 03:51.499
* We make it, you
make it, they make it, *

03:51.532 --> 03:54.535
* M-m-m-m-m-m-
Make it pop! *

03:55.235 --> 03:57.505
Welcome back to
'Stark Raving Mad,'

03:57.538 --> 03:59.540
where we follow
the highs, the lows,

03:59.573 --> 04:01.475
and the lowers
of Melwood Stark

04:01.509 --> 04:04.011
as he pursues his
Broadway dream...

04:04.044 --> 04:05.446
I'm just about
to audition.

04:05.479 --> 04:08.982
Watch as I put the
STAR back in Stark!

04:09.016 --> 04:11.619
Or take the K off of
Stark and then you know,

04:11.652 --> 04:14.121
discover a star again,
whichever comes first.

04:14.154 --> 04:16.424
You're about to see
what happens live when

04:16.457 --> 04:19.360
the siren call of
Broadway beckons--

04:19.393 --> 04:23.597
or 'beak-owns' as we
theater-folk say.

04:23.631 --> 04:27.000
I've even got my
lucky leg warmers on.

04:27.034 --> 04:28.369
I am ready to go!

04:31.038 --> 04:32.340
Where'd you get that?

04:32.373 --> 04:34.274
It's my back-up phone.

04:34.308 --> 04:36.043
I can't believe
this is happening.

04:36.076 --> 04:37.277
Bad signal or...?

04:37.311 --> 04:39.680
No, 'Stark Raving Mad.'

04:39.713 --> 04:41.515
What a waste of a
golden opportunity.

04:41.549 --> 04:43.250
I am the internet star.

04:43.283 --> 04:46.354
My life is way more
interesting than Mr. Stark's.

04:46.387 --> 04:48.456
Just me, being me...

04:48.489 --> 04:50.391
for hours and hours of TV!

04:50.424 --> 04:51.692
Oh! Selfie!

04:51.725 --> 04:52.426
(camera shutter)

04:52.460 --> 04:53.160
(sighs)

04:54.294 --> 04:57.631
Ooh!

04:57.665 --> 05:00.033
"No talking allowed, and turn
off your back-up phone.

05:00.067 --> 05:02.069
It's against the rules of
detention. Love, Corki."

05:02.102 --> 05:03.203
Shhh!

05:03.236 --> 05:05.539
Pbbbbt!

05:05.573 --> 05:14.682
*

05:14.715 --> 05:15.616
Uh... Jared?

05:15.649 --> 05:16.617
Shoo.

05:16.650 --> 05:19.052
I had egg on my face
because of that stupid bet.

05:19.086 --> 05:20.020
Literally.

05:20.053 --> 05:21.254
Can we just start over?

05:21.288 --> 05:22.423
Okay.

05:22.456 --> 05:23.791
Hi I'm Corki.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.026
I like math, long
walks on the beach,

05:26.059 --> 05:28.629
and people who don't
publicly humiliate me!

05:28.662 --> 05:29.430
Ha!

05:29.463 --> 05:31.331
That didn't go as
well as I'd hoped.

05:31.365 --> 05:39.106
*

05:39.139 --> 05:40.508
And I want a diving tower.

05:40.541 --> 05:41.575
A really high one.

05:41.609 --> 05:44.812
One that attracts
Olympians, wealthy benefactors,

05:44.845 --> 05:48.081
and separates cowardly
students from the brave...

05:48.115 --> 05:49.049
Can't wait.

05:49.082 --> 05:52.152
Okay, buh-bye!

05:52.185 --> 05:54.254
Hello, Valerie.

05:54.287 --> 05:55.689
How'd you know it was me?

05:55.723 --> 05:57.324
You smell like omelette.

05:59.292 --> 06:02.295
Maybe a second
shower's in order.

06:04.231 --> 06:06.333
The egg incident really
made me want to

06:06.366 --> 06:08.335
focus on something positive.

06:08.368 --> 06:11.138
Something that takes
advantage of my many gifts.

06:11.171 --> 06:12.039
Uh huh.

06:12.072 --> 06:15.375
Unfortunately, due to
backstage politics,

06:15.409 --> 06:17.177
I was demoted from the play!

06:17.210 --> 06:18.111
Me!

06:18.145 --> 06:19.513
It's true what they say
about show biz--

06:19.547 --> 06:21.615
it's cut-throat out there.

06:21.649 --> 06:24.151
But I have a
vision for the show.

06:24.184 --> 06:26.386
And with your permission,
I really think

06:26.420 --> 06:28.221
I can bring that
vision to life.

06:28.255 --> 06:29.222
Why not?

06:29.256 --> 06:30.390
Sounds great!

06:30.424 --> 06:32.159
(squeals)

06:32.192 --> 06:35.696
I will not disappoint
you, Ms. Diona!

06:35.729 --> 06:36.764
(small laugh)

06:37.598 --> 06:38.832
That would be refreshing.

06:44.805 --> 06:46.073
(sighs)

06:51.712 --> 06:54.381
*

06:54.414 --> 06:55.382
Excuse me.

06:57.284 --> 06:57.851
Pardon me.

07:00.320 --> 07:01.555
Corki.

07:01.589 --> 07:05.559
I didn't want to play this card,
but you've left me no choice.

07:05.593 --> 07:07.761
Maybe we can talk...

07:07.795 --> 07:09.797
over there.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.098
(dreamy sigh)

07:12.399 --> 07:15.168
I don't want to talk to you.

07:15.202 --> 07:15.803
Hear that?

07:15.836 --> 07:18.472
Leave Corki alone.

07:18.506 --> 07:22.275
*

07:22.309 --> 07:23.376
What?

07:23.410 --> 07:25.813
The Sun Hi Nation and I just
want to change the subject

07:25.846 --> 07:28.215
to find out more about
your kiss with Caleb.

07:28.248 --> 07:29.082
Sun Hi!

07:29.116 --> 07:31.351
Can't everyone just
scrape gum quietly?

07:31.384 --> 07:32.486
Like Dylan.

07:32.520 --> 07:33.554
Right, Dylan?

07:33.587 --> 07:34.622
Don't answer.

07:34.655 --> 07:37.257
That would ruin the whole
point of what I just said.

07:37.891 --> 07:40.694
With Mr. Stark gone, I
think I can safely say

07:40.728 --> 07:42.395
that I'm back in the play.

07:42.429 --> 07:44.231
So catch me up!

07:44.264 --> 07:45.332
Are the costumes done?

07:45.365 --> 07:46.433
Not quite.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.501
Is the music done?

07:47.535 --> 07:49.302
Not quite.

07:49.336 --> 07:51.371
Have people
memorized their scripts?

07:51.404 --> 07:54.508
Have you seen how long
Mr. Stark's script is?

07:54.542 --> 07:58.411
You may remember
that I wasn't cast.

07:58.445 --> 08:00.648
I only read under
joyful circumstances.

08:00.681 --> 08:02.482
Oh. Right. Forgot.

08:02.516 --> 08:04.217
The play sounds like a mess.

08:04.251 --> 08:07.888
As a versatile thespian, I could
lead the cast in improvisation,

08:07.921 --> 08:09.957
tableaux work and
choral singing--

08:09.990 --> 08:10.858
Stop!!!

08:10.891 --> 08:12.560
I said I was sorry.

08:12.593 --> 08:14.662
Why can't we
just start anew?

08:14.695 --> 08:16.263
I'll do anything!

08:16.296 --> 08:19.767
She asked you to be
quiet, how about doing that?

08:19.800 --> 08:21.702
I can't keep quiet!

08:21.735 --> 08:24.404
I really like Corki, and
I want another chance.

08:24.437 --> 08:28.576
How can she deny the chin?

08:28.609 --> 08:29.409
Caleb...

08:31.378 --> 08:33.380
...what do you think
about all of this?

08:33.981 --> 08:36.349
Me? Uh...

08:36.383 --> 08:39.452
I don't like to get involved
in matters of the heart.

08:39.486 --> 08:42.522
Never really know
what's gonna happen?

08:42.556 --> 08:44.658
We wanna know
what the boys think.

08:44.692 --> 08:46.594
Boys don't think!

08:46.627 --> 08:48.596
This seems like a trap...

08:48.629 --> 08:49.797
You girls seem really mad.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.464
You wanna see mad?

08:51.498 --> 08:52.766
Keep stalling.

08:52.800 --> 08:57.571
Well... I think that Jared
did something very wrong,

08:57.605 --> 08:59.272
no doubt about it,

08:59.306 --> 09:00.908
but then he did
the right thing

09:00.941 --> 09:03.711
by admitting his mistake
and apologizing.

09:03.744 --> 09:05.512
As Alexander Pope once said,

09:05.545 --> 09:09.516
'To err is human, to
forgive, divine.'

09:09.549 --> 09:11.919
*

09:11.952 --> 09:13.787
Nicely done, Dylan.

09:13.821 --> 09:15.488
Agreed.

09:15.522 --> 09:16.990
That went well.

09:17.024 --> 09:19.660
You have got to be
kidding me, forgive?

09:19.693 --> 09:23.263
After what he did-- a bet
that he could kiss Corki!?

09:23.296 --> 09:24.331
Never.

09:24.364 --> 09:25.833
Ugh! Boys!

09:25.866 --> 09:27.500
Boys... and... girls...

09:27.534 --> 09:28.769
Can't we all get along?

09:28.802 --> 09:31.972
* We love em boys boys
boys boys, yeah, yeah, *

09:32.005 --> 09:36.844
* We love em boys boys

09:36.877 --> 09:40.447
* They got a weakness
that they can't deny, *

09:40.480 --> 09:42.015
* Frontin' left and right,

09:42.049 --> 09:44.918
* Sweatin' all the time,

09:44.952 --> 09:48.055
* The boys are flexing
in the locker room, *

09:48.088 --> 09:50.057
* Howling at the moon,

09:50.090 --> 09:52.960
* Trying to make us swoon,

09:52.993 --> 09:56.764
* How can you blame us when
they're looking like that, *

09:56.797 --> 10:00.868
* Talkin' like that,
they're so messy like that, *

10:00.901 --> 10:04.604
* Girls, if you feel me
let me hear you say yeah, *

10:04.638 --> 10:07.975
* We can't pick one
we just like em all, *

10:08.008 --> 10:11.979
* We love em boys boys

10:12.012 --> 10:16.984
* We love em boys boys

* Got us all sorry, hey
but we lovin' them girls, *

10:24.391 --> 10:26.359
* What would we
do without you, *

10:26.393 --> 10:27.995
* You drive us
crazy, don'tcha? *

10:28.028 --> 10:29.997
* Now just sit back and relax,

10:30.030 --> 10:32.632
* and the boys will
sing it for you, *

10:32.666 --> 10:34.434
* We love em good girls

10:34.467 --> 10:36.069
* We love em bad girls,

10:36.103 --> 10:40.073
* We love em prep girls, we
love em rock girls, yeah *

10:40.107 --> 10:41.975
* We love 'em smart boys

10:42.009 --> 10:44.044
* We love 'em jock boys

10:44.077 --> 10:48.081
* So if you think like us,
throw your hands up *

10:48.115 --> 10:51.952
* We love em girls, girls,

10:51.985 --> 10:56.890
* We love em boys boys
boys boys, yeah, yeah, *

10:56.924 --> 11:00.393
* Truth is they're always
gonna drive us mad, *

11:00.427 --> 11:02.029
* That is just a fact,

11:02.062 --> 11:04.865
* Still we take them back,

11:04.898 --> 11:08.068
* But come to think of
it they're patient too, *

11:08.101 --> 11:09.937
* Cause we bend the rules,

11:09.970 --> 11:12.873
* Doing what we do,

11:12.906 --> 11:15.575
* Like spending hours
locked up in the bathroom, *

11:15.608 --> 11:18.078
* With our friends
and that's true, *

11:18.111 --> 11:20.914
* Swapping lipstick
and rouge, *

11:20.948 --> 11:24.918
* Then we go check if
they update their page, *

11:24.952 --> 11:28.021
* Liking their status and
the pics, what can I say, *

11:28.055 --> 11:29.923
* We love em good girls,

11:29.957 --> 11:31.992
* We love em bad girls

11:32.025 --> 11:33.927
* We love em prep girls,

11:33.961 --> 11:36.063
* We love em rock girls yeah,

11:36.096 --> 11:37.931
* We love em smart girls

11:37.965 --> 11:40.000
* We love em cheer girls

11:40.033 --> 11:42.069
* Boys if you
think like me, *

11:42.102 --> 11:44.004
* throw em up and sing,

11:44.037 --> 11:48.008
* We love em girls, girls,
girls, girls, yeah, yeah *

11:48.041 --> 11:51.945
* We love em boys boys
boys boys, yeah, yeah *

11:51.979 --> 11:56.416
* We love em girls, girls,
girls, girls, yeah, yeah *

11:56.449 --> 12:00.453
* We love em boys boys
boys boys, yeah, yeah *

12:07.694 --> 12:11.932
*

12:11.965 --> 12:13.000
It's on.

12:13.033 --> 12:16.103
Boys against girls.

12:16.136 --> 12:18.071
At least everyone's involved.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.206
Pbbbbbt!

12:19.239 --> 12:20.941
*

12:21.608 --> 12:23.043
*

12:23.076 --> 12:24.677
Ms. Diona?

12:24.711 --> 12:26.146
I hope we're not
disturbing you.

12:26.179 --> 12:27.114
No.

12:27.147 --> 12:28.782
Just planning a major
triumph for mysel--

12:28.816 --> 12:31.184
the school, for the school!

12:31.218 --> 12:33.186
I wanted to update
you on the show.

12:33.220 --> 12:34.621
What show?

12:34.654 --> 12:35.655
The school play.

12:35.688 --> 12:37.057
The Wonderful
Wizard of Oz...

12:37.090 --> 12:37.690
Remember?

12:37.724 --> 12:39.526
Of cour-- Yes, Of course.

12:39.559 --> 12:40.760
Are we still doing that?

12:40.794 --> 12:41.761
Uh huh.

12:41.795 --> 12:43.530
This new version, will
have lots of clapping,

12:43.563 --> 12:45.065
staccato talking and
simple rhyme schemes,

12:45.098 --> 12:48.802
along with a few enthusiastic
arm pumps and woo-hoos.

12:48.836 --> 12:50.737
Uh huh. Cool.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.906
Also, all the outfits
will be pink.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.774
And Dorothy will
be a cheerleader.

12:54.808 --> 12:57.744
And the Wizard will be
played by our mascot,

12:57.777 --> 12:58.711
MacKendrick the Beagle.

12:58.745 --> 13:00.547
(squeals)

13:00.580 --> 13:01.281
I see.

13:01.314 --> 13:03.050
And what brought
on this change?

13:03.083 --> 13:05.718
I just see it as an
opportunity to highlight my--

13:05.752 --> 13:08.822
--OUR strengths.

13:08.856 --> 13:10.490
And pink is my color.

13:10.523 --> 13:12.692
It's the cheerleader
version of Oz!

13:12.725 --> 13:14.527
Couldn't you just die?

13:14.561 --> 13:16.563
I could!

13:16.596 --> 13:18.098
Knock yourself out.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.933
Ahh! Thank you!

13:19.967 --> 13:22.936
*

13:22.970 --> 13:28.275
This new cheerleader version of
Oz is a formula for disaster.

13:28.308 --> 13:32.045
Looks like demolition on the
auditorium can begin next week.

13:32.079 --> 13:34.514
*

13:34.547 --> 13:36.649
I can't believe you guys
are sticking together

13:36.683 --> 13:37.750
after everything Jared did.

13:37.784 --> 13:40.753
With all this male bonding,
we should just be thankful

13:40.787 --> 13:43.256
they're not crushing soda
cans on their foreheads.

13:43.290 --> 13:45.825
Look, this isn't about
guys versus girls.

13:45.859 --> 13:48.996
I just think Jared and
Corki need to get over this.

13:49.029 --> 13:51.698
He's kind of right...

13:51.731 --> 13:53.233
Don't get all
fuzzy now Corki.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.268
This is bigger than you.

13:55.302 --> 13:59.772
This isn't just about Jared and
his terrible, terrible choices.

13:59.806 --> 14:02.309
This is about our
entire gender.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.944
Girl power rules!!!

14:03.977 --> 14:05.979
What she said!

14:06.013 --> 14:09.883
I just don't understand
how things work around here.

14:09.917 --> 14:11.118
Maybe I never will.

14:11.151 --> 14:12.652
What do you mean?

14:12.685 --> 14:15.155
Between school, the
show and the band,

14:15.188 --> 14:19.692
I've tried a lot of new things
I was afraid of before. I...

14:19.726 --> 14:21.594
...found some courage?

14:21.628 --> 14:23.030
A little.

14:23.063 --> 14:24.731
It was easier in Beijing.

14:24.764 --> 14:26.233
I was home-schooled by tutors

14:26.266 --> 14:28.801
and I didn't have to
worry about this...

14:28.835 --> 14:31.939
...complicated
personal stuff.

14:31.972 --> 14:32.772
Wait.

14:36.944 --> 14:38.545
You want to go home?

14:41.114 --> 14:42.149
What about XO-IQ?

14:44.317 --> 14:46.186
I'll go home with you.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.188
I didn't invite you.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.422
Right.

14:49.456 --> 14:53.693
But anywhere I go, I look
good, so that would be a bonus.

14:53.726 --> 14:56.063
You need your friends!

14:56.096 --> 14:56.663
Yeah!

14:56.696 --> 14:58.065
And Dylan agrees with me.

15:02.202 --> 15:03.971
I need you.

15:04.004 --> 15:05.905
I mean, whose very
expensive flat iron

15:05.939 --> 15:07.807
will I borrow
without asking?

15:07.840 --> 15:09.977
Maybe you didn't have
problems back home,

15:10.010 --> 15:11.678
but you didn't
have us either.

15:11.711 --> 15:13.913
Friends are way more important
than some silly argument

15:13.947 --> 15:16.183
about how much better
we are than boys.

15:16.216 --> 15:17.817
Which we are, by the way.

15:17.850 --> 15:18.918
A lot.

15:18.952 --> 15:21.688
I mean, so so much better.

15:21.721 --> 15:23.690
But that's not the point.

15:23.723 --> 15:24.992
What is going on here?

15:25.025 --> 15:27.794
*

15:27.827 --> 15:29.196
Corki: Uh...

15:30.297 --> 15:32.665
Okay... Number
thirty-nine?

15:32.699 --> 15:33.866
Melwood Stark?

15:33.900 --> 15:38.838
*

15:38.871 --> 15:40.140
Not shaking okay.

15:40.173 --> 15:41.208
I could have germs.

15:41.241 --> 15:43.010
Which I don't.
I don't have germs.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.711
Tell us a bit
about yourself?

15:44.744 --> 15:47.747
I am best known for my
one-man show, that I wrote,

15:47.780 --> 15:50.150
performed, directed,
produced, choreographed

15:50.183 --> 15:52.252
and sold tickets for
door-to-door, called

15:52.285 --> 15:54.787
"I Can Dance: The Musical."

15:54.821 --> 15:56.823
And what do you
have for us today?

15:56.856 --> 15:59.226
The opening number
from "I Can Dance".

15:59.259 --> 16:02.095
Called "Two Left
Feet, Twice the Rhythm."

16:02.129 --> 16:02.729
Proceed.

16:04.031 --> 16:05.265
Thank you.

16:05.298 --> 16:06.133
(exhales)

16:06.166 --> 16:10.303
*

16:10.337 --> 16:11.204
(lights snapping on)

16:14.774 --> 16:16.376
Mr. Stark!

16:16.409 --> 16:17.744
MR. STARK?

16:18.978 --> 16:20.847
Well, if we have an audition
for a deer caught in headlights,

16:20.880 --> 16:22.749
we'll be sure to let you know.

16:22.782 --> 16:25.385
Would someone get this
man off my stage?

16:25.418 --> 16:27.954
(gurgling)

16:27.987 --> 16:29.456
Wait! I can do it.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.958
Trust me, give
me another shot!

16:31.991 --> 16:35.128
Lucky leg warmers,
you've let me down again!

16:35.162 --> 16:36.196
I blame you.

16:36.229 --> 16:38.198
Did you not hear
a word I said?

16:38.231 --> 16:42.235
To be honest, I tend
to tune out a fair bit.

16:42.269 --> 16:46.473
Well, while you have not been
scraping gum off the desks,

16:46.506 --> 16:48.408
other members of the
student body have

16:48.441 --> 16:51.978
been applying themselves
in meaningful ways.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.046
Come with me.

16:53.080 --> 17:00.153
*

17:00.187 --> 17:03.256
Valerie wants to give an update
on the progress of the play.

17:03.290 --> 17:04.357
Valerie?

17:04.391 --> 17:07.460
Thank you, Ms. Diona.

17:07.494 --> 17:08.328
Ready?

17:08.361 --> 17:08.961
Okay.

17:08.995 --> 17:10.463
Tin Woodman's got an axe!

17:10.497 --> 17:11.931
Dorothy's got a dog!

17:11.964 --> 17:13.366
The lion is a 'fraidy cat!

17:13.400 --> 17:14.934
The Scarecrow's
made of straw!

17:14.967 --> 17:16.403
Goooooo

17:16.436 --> 17:17.904
To seeeeee

17:17.937 --> 17:18.971
The Wizard!

17:19.005 --> 17:20.107
Woo-hoo!

17:20.140 --> 17:21.241
(Ms. Diona chuckles)

17:23.143 --> 17:25.778
Is she planning to turn The
Wonderful Wizard of Oz

17:25.812 --> 17:27.280
into a cheerleading
routine?

17:27.314 --> 17:30.049
I believe the term your
looking for is Spirit Squad.

17:30.083 --> 17:32.285
And with that, you
are all dismissed.

17:32.319 --> 17:33.520
Detention over.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.822
*

17:35.855 --> 17:37.990
Did you see Valerie's routine?

17:38.024 --> 17:39.426
It scared me.

17:39.459 --> 17:40.893
It hurt my heart.

17:40.927 --> 17:42.295
It hurt my brain.

17:42.329 --> 17:43.930
We can't let that happen.

17:43.963 --> 17:45.765
We have to take
the show back.

17:45.798 --> 17:47.234
But we only have
three days.

17:47.267 --> 17:48.501
Will you stop saying that?

17:48.535 --> 17:50.103
She can say
whatever she wants!

17:50.137 --> 17:52.172
Oh yes of course.
Anything you want.

17:52.205 --> 17:53.306
I'll find the actors.

17:54.207 --> 17:55.275
Done!

17:55.308 --> 17:57.277
*

17:57.310 --> 17:58.911
I'll find some others too.

17:58.945 --> 18:00.147
I'll finish up the costumes.

18:00.180 --> 18:01.414
And I've got the music.

18:01.448 --> 18:03.450
We still have a
performance at Ry Ri.

18:03.483 --> 18:04.484
We gotta go.

18:04.517 --> 18:06.419
It was really nice spending
the day together--

18:06.453 --> 18:07.487
Not listening.

18:07.520 --> 18:08.321
Let's go.

18:08.355 --> 18:09.489
*

18:09.522 --> 18:11.057
Well, that's a relief, boys.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.526
I have seen enough old
gum to last a lifetime.

18:14.394 --> 18:16.496
Aw, really dude?

18:16.529 --> 18:20.099
That's so gross. Ugh.

18:20.133 --> 18:21.100
(gags)

18:21.134 --> 18:22.034
*

18:22.068 --> 18:24.337
I don't know why, but
she makes me feel

18:24.371 --> 18:26.839
like I'm running
through a field.

18:26.873 --> 18:27.974
A field of daisies.

18:28.007 --> 18:31.311
*

18:31.911 --> 18:34.113
*

18:34.147 --> 18:35.047
Showtime.

18:35.081 --> 18:37.584
You know what Caleb,
I've been thinking.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.252
Ms. Diona was right.

18:39.286 --> 18:41.254
Detention is
character building...

18:41.288 --> 18:43.556
For the boys!
