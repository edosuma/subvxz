WEBVTT

00:08.269 --> 00:10.836
- Hey, Sarge?
Is here good for this stuff?

00:10.880 --> 00:13.100
- Yeah, there's good.

00:16.146 --> 00:17.408
- So how long you been
volunteering here?

00:17.452 --> 00:20.194
- Eh, since it started.
About six months or so.

00:20.237 --> 00:22.587
They used to build
farm equipment here.

00:22.631 --> 00:24.502
They used to make things
in Chicago.

00:24.546 --> 00:27.853
But then the plants closed
and all those jobs--

00:27.897 --> 00:29.377
- Yeah, here we are.

00:29.420 --> 00:30.856
It's great for these guys
though, right?

00:30.900 --> 00:32.032
- Yeah.

00:32.075 --> 00:33.076
Man, you wouldn't believe
what we found

00:33.120 --> 00:34.208
when were clearing this out.

00:34.251 --> 00:35.470
Needles, all that.

00:35.513 --> 00:37.689
No wonder the city
gave it to us for free.

00:37.733 --> 00:38.734
But, you know.

00:38.777 --> 00:40.736
Safe space,
place for kids to learn

00:40.779 --> 00:42.607
how to grow things
straight from the ground.

00:42.651 --> 00:44.000
It's a big deal.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.610
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:45.654 --> 00:47.047
That's ready
when I say it's ready.

00:47.090 --> 00:48.700
- Copy that.

00:48.744 --> 00:52.095
- Anyway, I want you to help me
to spread some manure.

00:52.139 --> 00:53.749
- Aw, crap.

00:53.792 --> 00:55.229
- Turkey crap, to be exact.

00:56.795 --> 00:59.015
- 22-21, units on a city-wide.
- Saved by the bell.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.712
- We're getting
multiple calls of shots fired

01:00.756 --> 01:03.063
in the area of 4000 Avers,
North Lawndale.

01:03.106 --> 01:04.455
No further at this time.

01:04.499 --> 01:07.371
- Four blocks, left on Avers,
couple blocks down.

01:07.415 --> 01:08.546
- All right, thanks.
- Yeah.

01:08.590 --> 01:09.808
- Copy that.
5021 George responding.

01:13.377 --> 01:14.944
5021 George, I'm on scene.

01:14.987 --> 01:16.728
I'm at 4400 Avers.

01:16.772 --> 01:18.208
- There.

01:18.252 --> 01:19.296
- Okay,
how many gunshots you hear?

01:19.340 --> 01:21.168
- Four, maybe five?

01:21.211 --> 01:22.734
- You see anybody run out
or anybody with a gun?

01:22.778 --> 01:25.259
- No, sir, I heard voices and
then shots and then nothing.

01:25.302 --> 01:26.390
- All right,
could you go back inside?

01:26.434 --> 01:28.392
Stay away from the windows.
- Okay.

01:28.436 --> 01:30.351
5021 George,
offender possibly still inside.

01:30.394 --> 01:32.092
- 10-4, 5021.

01:32.135 --> 01:36.357
2923 are en route if you
want to stand by for backup.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.141
- 5021 George,
I'm going dark.

01:38.185 --> 01:39.795
- Copy.

01:51.285 --> 01:53.591
- Come on...

02:01.773 --> 02:04.385
- Are you okay?
You okay?

02:04.428 --> 02:06.387
All right, listen.
You stay here, don't move.

02:06.430 --> 02:07.779
It's gonna be okay.

02:07.823 --> 02:08.780
All right?

02:26.929 --> 02:28.452
Oh, my God.

02:36.286 --> 02:37.940
Hold on, hold on.
Stay behind me.

02:40.029 --> 02:42.423
Come on.
Let's go.

02:50.344 --> 02:55.914
No, no, no!

02:55.958 --> 03:01.093
No, God, no!

03:01.137 --> 03:03.531
God, please!

03:03.574 --> 03:08.188
Take me!

03:08.231 --> 03:13.845
No, no, please take me!

03:20.374 --> 03:23.464
- It looks like
a dope hit gone wrong.

03:23.507 --> 03:25.161
Kids weren't
supposed to be inside.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.858
I think the offender
kicked in the door

03:26.902 --> 03:30.471
and he just stumbled across
the kids by mistake.

03:30.514 --> 03:33.952
- Covered his tracks.
- Yeah.

03:33.996 --> 03:36.172
In the living room
I found the two local kids,

03:36.216 --> 03:38.827
David Tatum and Aaron Powell.

03:38.870 --> 03:41.786
They were both
shot in the head.

03:41.830 --> 03:45.921
Everybody was done
at close range.

03:45.964 --> 03:48.619
A third kid made it.
He's uninjured.

03:48.663 --> 03:50.230
- Yeah, they're taking him
to Med to get checked out.

03:50.273 --> 03:52.275
- All right,
did he see anything?

03:52.319 --> 03:53.842
- He was taking a pee.

03:53.885 --> 03:55.191
He was in the bathroom
the whole time.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.715
That's what saved him.
It's where I found him.

03:57.759 --> 03:59.369
Talked to Patrol,

03:59.413 --> 04:01.893
he said that he heard the shots
but he didn't see anything.

04:01.937 --> 04:05.810
Um...guy guarding the door
is ID'd as Rayford Godfrey.

04:05.854 --> 04:10.075
He's a Hustlers food soldier.
I think he died immediately.

04:10.119 --> 04:12.861
Guys on the corner said that
Ray was soft for the kids,

04:12.904 --> 04:16.386
so he probably just let them in
to play video games.

04:16.430 --> 04:18.562
- Are those the bangers
you talked to?

04:18.606 --> 04:20.564
- Yeah.

04:20.608 --> 04:22.697
West Side Hustlers.
This is their joint.

04:22.740 --> 04:25.177
It's a stash house, flop house,
et cetera.

04:25.221 --> 04:26.309
- Mm.

04:26.353 --> 04:27.658
- Shot caller's
around the block.

04:27.702 --> 04:29.269
His name's Kareem.
He's willing to talk to us.

04:29.312 --> 04:32.359
- Well,
we're running point on this.

04:32.402 --> 04:35.449
So neighbors, footprints,
barking dogs,

04:35.492 --> 04:39.148
the means, the ends,
we run it all down.

04:39.191 --> 04:40.584
All right.
PODs, Shot Spotters?

04:40.628 --> 04:42.282
- Not on the block.

04:42.325 --> 04:43.892
- We'll expand the perimeter.

04:45.546 --> 04:49.114
- These people need answers.

04:49.158 --> 04:50.855
We are gonna give 'em to 'em.

04:55.338 --> 04:58.776
All right, Jay.

05:01.257 --> 05:04.347
- Look, knock down doors,
whatever you need to do, okay?

05:04.391 --> 05:05.957
This is real.

05:06.001 --> 05:08.395
- Kareem, this is my sergeant,
Hank Voigt.

05:17.055 --> 05:20.581
- Never had no sit-down
with no cop before.

05:20.624 --> 05:22.670
- I won't tell a soul.

05:27.065 --> 05:29.894
We need to talk about
what happens now, Kareem.

05:29.938 --> 05:32.723
- Man, this is not--
- Peace, Pete.

05:37.075 --> 05:38.642
- What happened today

05:38.686 --> 05:41.645
typically requires
a certain response from you.

05:41.689 --> 05:43.908
- One of those babies
was my nephew.

05:43.952 --> 05:45.388
- I'm sorry.

05:45.432 --> 05:49.653
And I can't even imagine
that feeling.

05:49.697 --> 05:54.005
But I need time, Kareem,
to do this by the book.

05:54.049 --> 05:58.619
And that's not for me or you.
It's for this neighborhood.

05:58.662 --> 06:00.925
'Cause we need to be able
to walk back in here

06:00.969 --> 06:04.886
and tell these people,
"We got 'em."

06:04.929 --> 06:06.801
- We know what
the alternative is.

06:06.844 --> 06:10.065
That's not gonna
bring those kids back.

06:14.765 --> 06:18.029
- Let me ask you something.

06:18.073 --> 06:20.554
You trust me?

06:20.597 --> 06:21.729
- I don't know you.

06:21.772 --> 06:23.426
- Exactly.

06:32.304 --> 06:33.523
You ain't got forever.

06:33.567 --> 06:36.483
- I don't need forever.

06:36.526 --> 06:39.747
Wait a second, I'm not done.

06:42.184 --> 06:43.968
This whole thing--

06:44.012 --> 06:49.409
it started out
as a burglary, right?

06:49.452 --> 06:53.369
So we need to treat you
like the victim of a theft.

06:53.413 --> 06:57.242
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

06:57.286 --> 06:59.897
When someone gets robbed

06:59.941 --> 07:02.900
we trace the stolen goods
and whoever's got the goods.

07:02.944 --> 07:04.859
- Oh, hell no.

07:12.257 --> 07:13.258
- You want me to tell you

07:13.302 --> 07:14.912
what was up
in that stash house?

07:14.956 --> 07:15.913
What was taken?

07:15.957 --> 07:17.611
- Stolen.

07:17.654 --> 07:20.527
From your criminal enterprise.
Yes, that's correct.

07:20.570 --> 07:22.137
- This is entrapment, man.

07:22.180 --> 07:27.098
- I look like I give a damn
about making a drug bust, huh?

07:31.973 --> 07:37.500
Just give me what I need
to do my job.

07:37.544 --> 07:40.068
All right, here's what we got.

07:40.111 --> 07:43.767
Crystal ketamine,
400 grams packed up in jabs.

07:43.811 --> 07:46.466
Two handguns,
a semiautomatic rifle,

07:46.509 --> 07:48.642
roughly 23 grand in cash.

07:48.685 --> 07:50.470
- It's in small bills,
sorted in bundles.

07:50.513 --> 07:51.993
- They have any idea
who did it?

07:52.036 --> 07:53.124
- No, not yet.

07:53.168 --> 07:54.212
So let's look at rivals,

07:54.256 --> 07:56.258
recently released
violent offenders,

07:56.301 --> 07:59.000
potential anniversary
retributions, all of that.

07:59.043 --> 08:00.044
- We're on it.

08:00.088 --> 08:02.003
- What do you think
of this guy?

08:02.046 --> 08:03.483
- That's the closest
camera angle we got.

08:03.526 --> 08:05.136
In an alley two blocks away,

08:05.180 --> 08:07.443
and it's a minute after 911
got the first shots fired call.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.575
- And it looks like
he's running

08:08.618 --> 08:10.402
north towards Homan Square.

08:10.446 --> 08:12.056
- Uh-huh.
You run this guy?

08:12.100 --> 08:13.493
- Yeah.
Nothing on facial rec.

08:13.536 --> 08:14.624
- That's not nothing.

08:14.668 --> 08:16.104
Kareem said that
the stuff the guy lifted

08:16.147 --> 08:18.628
was in a green
military-style duffel bag.

08:18.672 --> 08:21.283
- All right,
so let's press for an ID.

08:21.326 --> 08:23.024
Canvass the neighborhood.

08:23.067 --> 08:25.940
Talking about Lawndale all
the way up into Homan Square.

08:25.983 --> 08:27.985
I realize
it's a fishing expedition,

08:28.029 --> 08:29.900
but it's what we got for now.

08:29.944 --> 08:30.858
Sir.

08:30.901 --> 08:33.077
- Sergeant.

08:33.121 --> 08:35.732
Hank, this case
is an utter mess.

08:35.776 --> 08:38.213
We got two dead kids.

08:38.256 --> 08:40.563
Heat's already coming down
from City Hall.

08:40.607 --> 08:41.956
- We're aware of the urgency,
sir.

08:41.999 --> 08:44.175
- Well,
I got a proposition for you.

08:44.219 --> 08:45.437
You know I'm a data guy.

08:45.481 --> 08:47.918
- Served you well.
- Could serve you well.

08:47.962 --> 08:50.399
Hank, this stuff I'm into,
it's not the competition.

08:50.442 --> 08:51.574
What you do,
boots on the ground,

08:51.618 --> 08:53.228
that is our bread and butter.

08:53.271 --> 08:54.664
All I'm trying to do is

08:54.708 --> 08:55.665
turn the lights on a little
brighter while you do it,

08:55.709 --> 08:57.537
put another tool in your bag.

08:57.580 --> 08:58.842
And we can take that photo,

08:58.886 --> 09:00.017
we can run it through
our new facial rec system.

09:00.061 --> 09:01.192
It's beta.

09:01.236 --> 09:03.543
It'll be off the books
but it is powerful.

09:03.586 --> 09:05.545
And it works, I've got three
arrests already with this thing

09:05.588 --> 09:07.024
and they are airtight.

09:07.068 --> 09:10.071
- Yeah, well, my guys already
ran facial rec, no dice.

09:10.114 --> 09:11.638
- Yeah--no, this is
a completely different thing.

09:11.681 --> 09:13.640
This is what comes next.

09:13.683 --> 09:15.206
Centralized database.

09:15.250 --> 09:19.297
That's our stuff plus FBI,
State Department, ICE, DMVs.

09:19.341 --> 09:21.169
That is 600 million images

09:21.212 --> 09:23.563
all filtered through
precision biometrics,

09:23.606 --> 09:27.392
locality-sensitive hashing.

09:27.436 --> 09:29.612
I know it's a lot.

09:29.656 --> 09:33.398
But, Hank,
the ACLU hates this thing.

09:33.442 --> 09:35.705
So do the bad guys.

09:35.749 --> 09:38.926
That tells you
everything you need to know.

09:38.969 --> 09:40.101
- This is going
to be the bridge

09:40.144 --> 09:42.233
from mapping faces
to mapping behavior.

09:42.277 --> 09:43.931
We're gonna be able
to read emotions,

09:43.974 --> 09:47.238
whether people are experiencing
joy, fear, jealousy.

09:47.282 --> 09:50.241
- Holy crap.
You can read that emotion?

09:52.156 --> 09:52.896
- Here he is.

09:52.940 --> 09:55.420
With 99.64% certainty,

09:55.464 --> 09:59.903
Marcus Jerome West, 27.

09:59.947 --> 10:02.602
- Can you map 765 Polk?

10:04.734 --> 10:05.909
- Okay.

10:05.953 --> 10:07.519
It is a half a mile
from the scene.

10:07.563 --> 10:08.433
That's where he was running to.

10:08.477 --> 10:09.826
- Home.

10:09.870 --> 10:13.482
- First pinched at 16.
Rap sheet is long.

10:13.525 --> 10:16.137
Drugs, burglary,
gun enhancement.

10:16.180 --> 10:18.618
He's indexed
in the gang database.

10:18.661 --> 10:22.186
Known associate of 312 Orion.

10:22.230 --> 10:23.666
- 312.

10:23.710 --> 10:25.494
I believe that's a squat
out in the projects.

10:25.537 --> 10:26.626
It's not our jurisdiction,

10:26.669 --> 10:27.627
but I can confirm that,
Sergeant.

10:27.670 --> 10:28.932
- Okay.

10:28.976 --> 10:30.412
- Okay, so this guy's
got a lot a long sheet.

10:30.455 --> 10:32.632
Theft, drugs, guns--and
he's a documented gangbanger

10:32.675 --> 10:33.850
affiliated with a crew

10:33.894 --> 10:35.591
that works
in the shadow of the Hustlers

10:35.635 --> 10:36.766
and aspires to bigger things.

10:36.810 --> 10:38.159
- That sounds right to me.

10:38.202 --> 10:41.684
- Look--I like the gadget,
but it's upside-down.

10:41.728 --> 10:42.990
I mean,

10:43.033 --> 10:44.948
it's handing us a suspect
before we've got a case.

10:44.992 --> 10:47.342
We got no evidence,
we got no motive.

10:47.385 --> 10:48.691
- I just handed you your guy.

10:48.735 --> 10:50.432
- This thing isn't even
online yet.

10:50.475 --> 10:52.695
It's not official.
I can't get a warrant.

10:52.739 --> 10:54.566
- Hank, it's Chicago
and my brother's a magistrate.

10:54.610 --> 10:56.830
I will get you a warrant.

10:56.873 --> 11:01.095
- Sarge,
we got two murdered kids.

11:01.138 --> 11:05.012
Let's go get this guy
before he's in the wind.

11:10.104 --> 11:12.759
- All right, so let's do it.

11:36.043 --> 11:37.479
- Let me know when to go.

11:37.522 --> 11:38.741
- Go.
- We're ready.

11:44.616 --> 11:45.879
- Move up.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.540
I got West.
He's going out the window!

11:58.805 --> 12:00.850
- There.
5021 Henry, we're in pursuit

12:00.894 --> 12:02.025
of a male black,
tank top, sweats,

12:02.069 --> 12:04.245
westbound 1500 block
of West Polk.

12:22.219 --> 12:23.786
- Stay down!

12:23.830 --> 12:25.440
- Spread your arms out!

12:25.483 --> 12:27.007
- Stay down, don't move!

12:27.050 --> 12:28.660
- 5021 Henry,
offender in custody.

12:39.323 --> 12:40.368
- Look at him, Marcus.

12:40.411 --> 12:41.978
Look at him.

12:42.022 --> 12:44.198
- I don't got a clue
what you're talking about, man.

12:44.241 --> 12:45.547
- Right, right, right.

12:45.590 --> 12:48.855
- More importantly,
neither do you.

12:52.772 --> 12:55.165
- So you didn't
kill those kids?

12:55.209 --> 12:58.473
But you were two blocks away
60 seconds after it happened?

12:58.516 --> 13:00.867
You're carrying a bag
of drugs, guns, and cash.

13:00.910 --> 13:02.042
And you're running home?

13:02.085 --> 13:03.565
- That ain't me, man.

13:03.608 --> 13:04.740
- Where'd you stash the bag?

13:04.784 --> 13:07.047
- I'm telling you, man.
That ain't me!

13:07.090 --> 13:08.483
- No, what you're telling me is

13:08.526 --> 13:10.050
you don't know what you were
doing when this went down.

13:10.093 --> 13:11.834
Where you were,
who you were with.

13:11.878 --> 13:15.359
So if your conscience is clear,
why'd you run?

13:15.403 --> 13:18.058
- Why'd I run?
- Yeah.

13:18.101 --> 13:19.624
- From the cops?

13:24.716 --> 13:27.850
You know, till you said that
I thought we was vibin', man.

13:27.894 --> 13:31.811
Felt like you can
really relate to my life.

13:31.854 --> 13:34.988
Poor black man in Chicago
and all.

13:35.031 --> 13:38.252
- Don't go there with me.
- Like you would understand.

13:38.295 --> 13:41.298
'Cause you would know.

13:41.342 --> 13:42.734
Poor black man in Chicago--

13:42.778 --> 13:45.912
cops bust your door,
you run.

13:45.955 --> 13:50.351
Whether you did something
or not.

13:50.394 --> 13:52.614
You run until
one of three things happens:

13:52.657 --> 13:56.096
You get caught, you get away,

13:56.139 --> 13:58.098
or you're dead.

14:01.231 --> 14:08.108
Because this train right here,
it's always on time.

14:11.938 --> 14:13.983
You call it running.

14:14.027 --> 14:16.856
I call it self-defense.

14:23.079 --> 14:26.474
- It is with heavy hearts
that we come before the Lord,

14:26.517 --> 14:29.956
praying for direction
and discernment.

14:29.999 --> 14:32.915
The scripture says,
"Weep with those who weep,"

14:32.959 --> 14:36.919
and so here we are,
all together.

14:36.963 --> 14:39.574
These boys belong
to the world now.

14:39.617 --> 14:42.316
Their lives were not wasted.

14:42.359 --> 14:44.535
And because of their sacrifice,

14:44.579 --> 14:48.365
someone is going to get up,
step up, stand up,

14:48.409 --> 14:50.890
and become
a part of the solution.

14:50.933 --> 14:51.934
Amen.

14:51.978 --> 14:53.022
all: Amen.

14:53.066 --> 14:54.806
- Listen,
we got a car wash going on

14:54.850 --> 14:57.461
in support of the family,
in support of these boys,

14:57.505 --> 14:58.854
and so please
take advantage of it.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.377
- I was wondering if
you could help me out, bud.

15:00.421 --> 15:01.813
- Have you guys
seen him before?

15:01.857 --> 15:03.641
- You ever seen this cat, man?
- No? None of you?

15:06.949 --> 15:08.908
Seen him?

15:11.040 --> 15:12.346
- No, sir.

15:12.389 --> 15:14.826
I don't know him.

15:14.870 --> 15:16.872
- You sure?

15:16.916 --> 15:21.877
- Never seen the dude.
He did it?

15:28.275 --> 15:30.930
- So we doing this here?

15:30.973 --> 15:33.410
- I'm just paying my respects,
bro.

15:33.454 --> 15:34.542
But yeah, here.

15:34.585 --> 15:37.284
Kids die,
decorum goes out the window.

15:37.327 --> 15:39.851
- Look, I'ma be real with you.

15:39.895 --> 15:42.724
Your time is running short.

15:42.767 --> 15:46.423
See all those people in there?

15:46.467 --> 15:48.991
That's a lot of pain.

15:49.035 --> 15:50.645
They need justice.

15:50.688 --> 15:51.820
And a lot of them,

15:51.863 --> 15:53.343
they don't expect it
to come from you;

15:53.387 --> 15:56.042
they expect it to come from me.

15:56.085 --> 16:00.263
So.

16:00.307 --> 16:02.526
- All right, hold on a secong.

16:02.570 --> 16:07.227
Why don't we double it, okay?

16:07.270 --> 16:08.924
- Long as you understand

16:08.968 --> 16:11.753
you're buying a clean car and
a proper burial for those boys.

16:11.796 --> 16:12.928
You ain't buying no good will

16:12.972 --> 16:17.106
and you ain't buying
no time neither.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.769
- We got 31 hours left to
charge this guy or he walks.

16:27.812 --> 16:30.424
- We can't let that happen.
- No kidding.

16:30.467 --> 16:31.947
I stuck my neck out
on this thing

16:31.991 --> 16:33.296
and we don't even have a case.

16:33.340 --> 16:34.602
- We know this is the guy,
100%.

16:34.645 --> 16:35.603
So just let me go in there,
I'll break him.

16:35.646 --> 16:36.734
I'll get a confession.

16:36.778 --> 16:38.823
- Okay, get it done.
- All right.

16:42.479 --> 16:43.567
All right.
Get up, Marcus.

16:43.611 --> 16:44.655
- Can I go now?

16:44.699 --> 16:46.179
- No, it's over.

16:46.222 --> 16:47.658
- What's over?

16:47.702 --> 16:49.182
- I got three witnesses
that put you on the block.

16:49.225 --> 16:50.618
- Man, they're lying!

16:50.661 --> 16:52.054
That ain't me!

16:52.098 --> 16:53.795
- Look, I don't think
you meant to kill anybody.

16:53.838 --> 16:54.970
You were dope sick.
You were looking to score.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.363
You stumbled across these kids.

16:56.406 --> 16:57.973
There's only one way
that can go down

16:58.017 --> 16:59.540
and it was probably
the worst day of your life.

16:59.583 --> 17:00.976
- No, man!

17:01.020 --> 17:02.108
- Look, I wish I could
take that away from you.

17:02.151 --> 17:03.979
I really do.
I wish I could but I can't.

17:08.940 --> 17:12.422
I'm a junkie, man.

17:12.466 --> 17:14.859
A tweaker.

17:14.903 --> 17:20.474
Yeah, I've done lots of
stupid stuff to feed my babies.

17:20.517 --> 17:23.738
Lost it all.
More than once.

17:23.781 --> 17:26.567
- Yeah.
It's a disease, Marcus.

17:26.610 --> 17:31.572
- I ain't no angel
but I ain't no killer either!

17:35.489 --> 17:38.492
And I ain't gonna
tell you otherwise!

17:38.535 --> 17:40.320
No, sir!

17:43.366 --> 17:46.500
So you do what you gotta do.

17:49.155 --> 17:52.114
- Okay, I will.

17:57.163 --> 17:59.339
- This is a good play.

17:59.382 --> 18:00.688
Some folks,

18:00.731 --> 18:02.124
you keep 'em here
their whole 48, it feels like

18:02.168 --> 18:04.126
somebody's just asking them
a couple of questions.

18:04.170 --> 18:09.000
But you sweat a guy in County,
things change real quick.

18:11.568 --> 18:14.832
Ever since this broke, I can't
stop thinking about those boys.

18:14.876 --> 18:18.184
Playing video games,
just looking for a little fun.

18:18.227 --> 18:20.186
- Yeah.

18:21.361 --> 18:24.625
I wish they'd come
to the garden instead.

18:24.668 --> 18:26.061
Maybe I missed them.

18:26.105 --> 18:29.630
- Sarge, you can't blame--
- Maybe we all did.

18:33.024 --> 18:34.722
Hey, Jay.

18:34.765 --> 18:37.377
Nail this monster, okay?

18:42.251 --> 18:43.774
- This ain't right, man.

18:43.818 --> 18:47.169
You're holding me on a murder
I didn't even do.

18:47.213 --> 18:48.910
You know what comes next,
right?

18:48.953 --> 18:51.042
Word always gets out
in the joint.

18:51.086 --> 18:52.740
- You have an alternative.
- Like what?

18:52.783 --> 18:54.307
-If you told me the truth right
now, I'll take you downstate.

18:54.350 --> 18:55.438
Be a lot less heat for you.

18:55.482 --> 18:59.442
- I've told you the truth,
every stop!

18:59.486 --> 19:02.880
- All set.
Signature here.

19:02.924 --> 19:05.535
- Keep an eye on him.

19:05.579 --> 19:08.408
- Walk-in customer.

19:11.324 --> 19:14.196
- You let me know
when you're ready to talk.

19:14.240 --> 19:17.286
- It ain't me, man!

19:17.330 --> 19:20.550
I've told you it ain't me!

19:27.731 --> 19:29.646
- Oh, yes, sir.
I do understand.

19:33.215 --> 19:34.390
All right,
we've got 11 hours left

19:34.434 --> 19:37.088
to make our case
against Marcus West.

19:37.132 --> 19:39.439
We got him sweating in County

19:39.482 --> 19:41.223
but all we got
is a surveillance photo

19:41.267 --> 19:42.703
from the alley near the house,

19:42.746 --> 19:45.532
which the State's Attorney
is going to toss

19:45.575 --> 19:47.882
because the facial rec system
we used to get it

19:47.925 --> 19:50.058
isn't even on the books yet.

19:50.101 --> 19:52.191
So where are we at
connecting West

19:52.234 --> 19:54.236
to gang activity
in North Lawndale?

19:54.280 --> 19:55.846
- We're gonna keep digging,
boss.

19:55.890 --> 19:58.458
- Good.
DNA?

19:58.501 --> 19:59.763
- The volume's overwhelming.

19:59.807 --> 20:00.982
The whole West Side's

20:01.025 --> 20:02.113
been in and out of that house
for years.

20:02.157 --> 20:03.245
They're shoveling
as fast as they can.

20:03.289 --> 20:04.420
So far, no hairs, no fibers,

20:04.464 --> 20:05.465
no blood
putting West inside that house,

20:05.508 --> 20:06.727
but I'm on top of it.

20:06.770 --> 20:08.424
- Have we tossed West's
apartment yet?

20:08.468 --> 20:10.731
- Top to bottom.
- No cash, no drugs, no dice.

20:10.774 --> 20:13.081
- We'll find it.

20:13.124 --> 20:16.302
- How about we do what we do,
hmm?

20:16.345 --> 20:18.260
Evidence, motive, means.

20:18.304 --> 20:20.262
Stick to our rules,
build a case.

20:20.306 --> 20:21.481
A witness, a print.

20:21.524 --> 20:23.570
- Hank, there's a problem.

20:23.613 --> 20:27.269
Marcus West
was attacked in County.

20:27.313 --> 20:28.705
- He was stabbed seven times,

20:28.749 --> 20:31.142
but that's not
the most pressing issue.

20:31.186 --> 20:32.666
His head injuries are so severe

20:32.709 --> 20:35.756
that we had to induce a coma,
shut down brain function.

20:35.799 --> 20:37.975
It was the only way
to minimize the swelling.

20:47.463 --> 20:49.160
- Is he gonna make it?

20:49.204 --> 20:52.381
- I think so.

20:52.425 --> 20:56.820
Got what he deserved, though.

20:56.864 --> 21:00.607
Almost.

21:00.650 --> 21:04.306
- Do everything you can
for him.

21:04.350 --> 21:07.788
Everything.

21:19.800 --> 21:22.150
- Inmate log from County?
- Yup.

21:22.193 --> 21:25.196
Complete with pictures.
Nothing jumps out.

21:25.240 --> 21:28.635
68 of our best and brightest
in lockup with West last night.

21:28.678 --> 21:30.419
You can eliminate
the frat boys from DePaul,

21:30.463 --> 21:31.942
but other than that.

21:37.948 --> 21:39.776
- You gotta be kidding me.

21:44.259 --> 21:45.826
You lied to me, Peter.

21:45.869 --> 21:47.218
- How's that?

21:47.262 --> 21:49.220
- You told me you didn't know
who Marcus West was.

21:49.264 --> 21:50.700
You know exactly who he is.

21:50.744 --> 21:52.833
- Had these
outstanding warrants

21:52.876 --> 21:55.575
for three years now.

21:55.618 --> 21:57.054
Come on, man.
Listen to this BS.

21:57.098 --> 22:01.015
Criminal trespass and
displaying fictitious plates?

22:01.058 --> 22:03.234
- So after three years it's
just weighing on you so bad

22:03.278 --> 22:04.584
you just had to
turn yourself in.

22:04.627 --> 22:06.977
- Come clean.
- Mm-hmm.

22:07.021 --> 22:08.588
You think you can just
come and check into jail

22:08.631 --> 22:10.372
like it's a motel
so you can get to Marcus West?

22:10.416 --> 22:13.027
- Something happen to him
in here?

22:15.421 --> 22:17.074
- Yeah, something happened.

22:24.125 --> 22:26.301
- Huh?

22:26.345 --> 22:30.174
- Sergeant, Marcus West
is in really bad shape.

22:30.218 --> 22:32.263
- All right,
anything from County?

22:32.307 --> 22:34.091
- No, Ruzek's
interviewing guys inside.

22:34.135 --> 22:36.964
Nobody's talking.

22:37.007 --> 22:38.226
Sarge?

22:38.269 --> 22:41.838
Did I--

22:41.882 --> 22:43.753
- Did you what?

22:43.797 --> 22:45.929
- I just wanted
to make the case so damn bad.

22:45.973 --> 22:47.540
Did I go too far?

22:47.583 --> 22:51.370
- Hey, we got two dead kids
and a city that needs answers.

22:51.413 --> 22:53.546
We're on the clock
and dying on the vine.

22:53.589 --> 22:54.677
- That's why I jammed him up.

22:54.721 --> 22:59.465
- Yeah.
Listen to me--hey.

22:59.508 --> 23:03.425
You are a good cop
with a good heart.

23:03.469 --> 23:07.255
It was the right play,
you hear me?

23:07.298 --> 23:09.736
Right now we gotta make a case
against Marcus West

23:09.779 --> 23:12.347
before he wakes up
and it has to be tight.

23:12.391 --> 23:13.348
Come on.

23:13.392 --> 23:14.697
Hey.

23:14.741 --> 23:16.264
See if Patrol missed anything.

23:16.307 --> 23:18.832
I want you to scrub this case
from the top, you hear me?

23:18.875 --> 23:20.834
Start with
talking to the kid again.

23:20.877 --> 23:22.575
- Yep.

23:22.618 --> 23:25.447
- Hey, give me something.

23:25.491 --> 23:27.101
- Well--

23:27.144 --> 23:29.451
we pulled the supporting docs
from the gang database listing

23:29.495 --> 23:32.541
and there are a couple things
that labeled West as a 312.

23:32.585 --> 23:34.500
He's friends with this cat
named Reuben Jones

23:34.543 --> 23:35.979
who lives over in Orion Courts

23:36.023 --> 23:39.026
and the gang database had
this picture from Instagram.

23:39.069 --> 23:43.944
It showed Marcus and Reuben
throwing up the same sign.

23:43.987 --> 23:45.685
- Orion Courts
is only a half mile

23:45.728 --> 23:47.121
from the heart
of the Hustler's turf.

23:47.164 --> 23:49.036
They get bigfooted
around the Hustlers every day.

23:49.079 --> 23:51.125
- Reuben Jones'
most recent offense

23:51.168 --> 23:52.518
was for moving ketamine.

23:52.561 --> 23:54.215
- And as you know, Sarge,

23:54.258 --> 23:57.523
it's the same drugs stolen
during the murders.

23:59.873 --> 24:03.137
- So this whole thing
could be 312 Orion

24:03.180 --> 24:05.182
planting a flag
trying to get in the game.

24:05.226 --> 24:08.751
- Right.
Yeah.

24:08.795 --> 24:10.927
- All right,
let's run it down.

24:10.971 --> 24:11.972
- Right.

24:23.462 --> 24:26.160
- How you doing?
- Hey.

24:28.249 --> 24:29.380
- Reuben Jones?

24:29.424 --> 24:30.469
- Oh, who that?

24:30.512 --> 24:32.383
- Chicago PD.

24:34.211 --> 24:36.257
Now, I ain't come here
to arrest you, dog.

24:36.300 --> 24:37.345
Hey!

24:41.784 --> 24:43.612
Get up!
Run again!

24:43.656 --> 24:45.701
- Don't do that.
That's not a good idea.

24:45.745 --> 24:47.398
I told you
I wasn't going to arrest you

24:47.442 --> 24:48.269
but you want to
do it the hard way.

24:48.312 --> 24:49.444
You got cuffs?

24:49.488 --> 24:51.881
- Yeah.
- Hey, get yo' ass up.

24:55.624 --> 24:58.845
- The street life
take discipline.

24:58.888 --> 25:00.629
This wasn't never
gonna be life for Marcus.

25:00.673 --> 25:03.153
Marcus is a user
and he steals.

25:03.197 --> 25:05.155
And on top of all that,
he ain't even good at it.

25:05.199 --> 25:07.418
- So if Marcus West
isn't in the gang,

25:07.462 --> 25:08.550
how do you know him?

25:08.594 --> 25:10.160
- We grew up together.

25:10.204 --> 25:11.510
You know, trick or treating,

25:11.553 --> 25:13.686
birthday parties,
little league.

25:13.729 --> 25:16.906
Garfield Park Green Dragons.
Y'all ain't never heard of us?

25:16.950 --> 25:21.389
- Nuh-uh.
We saw you, though.

25:21.432 --> 25:24.740
- Bro, y'all trippin'.

25:24.784 --> 25:27.961
Y'all know where we at.
Man, that's Orion Courts.

25:28.004 --> 25:32.095
It ain't no gang thing.
It's a neighborhood thing.

25:32.139 --> 25:33.357
- Okay, talk to me.

25:33.401 --> 25:34.794
- All right,

25:34.837 --> 25:37.710
bro moved away a few years ago
when his mom's passed.

25:37.753 --> 25:38.928
But he always around.

25:38.972 --> 25:41.148
You know the main reason why,
though?

25:41.191 --> 25:43.933
A/C.
We got it, he don't.

25:43.977 --> 25:46.762
Man, when it get hot,
he always around.

25:46.806 --> 25:48.808
Matter of fact,
I just seen him the other day.

25:48.851 --> 25:50.374
He was over there passed out

25:50.418 --> 25:52.202
snoring on the couch
like a chainsaw.

25:52.246 --> 25:54.857
Probably hit that weed,
had him out like a light.

25:54.901 --> 25:56.032
- Wait.

25:56.076 --> 25:57.991
What day was that?

25:58.034 --> 25:59.819
- Hmm.

26:00.297 --> 26:02.125
- He's been through so much.

26:02.169 --> 26:03.910
He just went through this
with the officers.

26:03.953 --> 26:05.781
- I know, but not like this.

26:05.825 --> 26:07.609
We need to go over everything
in detail.

26:07.653 --> 26:10.133
Any little bit of information
can change everything for us.

26:10.177 --> 26:12.179
- This is a chance
for Noah to be a hero.

26:14.355 --> 26:17.227
- I can do it.

26:17.271 --> 26:18.794
- Hey, Noah.
I'm Kim.

26:18.838 --> 26:21.405
I was just reading what you
told the Patrol officers.

26:21.449 --> 26:23.582
Let's start from where you
went into the bathroom, okay?

26:23.625 --> 26:24.974
Okay.

26:25.018 --> 26:26.976
So you go inside
and you close the door

26:27.020 --> 26:28.630
'cause that's what you do
when you pee, right?

26:28.674 --> 26:30.153
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

26:30.197 --> 26:31.502
- And that's when you heard
the bad guy

26:31.546 --> 26:32.852
kick in the front door, right?

26:32.895 --> 26:35.332
- No.

26:35.376 --> 26:37.247
- What do you mean, no?

26:37.291 --> 26:39.336
- So the kid did hear
the door get kicked in.

26:39.380 --> 26:40.860
- Yeah, but not until after.

26:40.903 --> 26:42.557
- After he heard the gunshots.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.515
- If the guy's
already in the house,

26:44.559 --> 26:46.343
why did he kick the door in?

26:46.387 --> 26:49.346
- Because he let himself in.

26:49.390 --> 26:51.348
Look, he popped the guy
watching the place.

26:51.392 --> 26:53.829
Stumbled on the kids who
weren't supposed to be there.

26:53.873 --> 26:56.527
He kicked in the door
on the way out.

26:56.571 --> 26:58.007
- For show.

26:58.051 --> 26:59.966
- Make it look like a break-in.

27:00.009 --> 27:01.228
- If this was an inside job,

27:01.271 --> 27:03.360
are we saying
we got the wrong guy?

27:08.583 --> 27:10.324
- Look, whoever did do this,

27:10.367 --> 27:13.327
we know he knew those kids
and those kids knew him.

27:13.370 --> 27:17.200
So he's probably in the
Hustlers and close to Kareem.

27:17.244 --> 27:19.028
- Got something, Sarge.

27:19.072 --> 27:21.509
POD footage from Orion Courts
the day of.

27:21.552 --> 27:23.816
- We got Marcus West
walking to his buddy's house.

27:23.859 --> 27:25.644
- And he's still in there
at 3:00 p.m.

27:27.863 --> 27:30.561
- Yeah, Marcus West.

27:33.260 --> 27:35.697
- Why wouldn't he
just say he's there?

27:35.741 --> 27:37.612
- He was doped up, Sarge.

27:37.656 --> 27:39.440
- And probably
protecting his buddy.

27:39.483 --> 27:41.921
I mean, Reuben Jones has
a couple outstanding warrants.

27:41.964 --> 27:44.706
- Oh, my God.
- Jay.

27:44.750 --> 27:46.882
He's gone.

27:46.926 --> 27:48.623
Marcus West.
He didn't make it.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.103
He's dead.

27:59.286 --> 28:00.200
- Come on.

28:01.767 --> 28:04.944
Your fancy software--
it didn't work, Derek.

28:04.987 --> 28:06.336
You gave us the name
Marcus West.

28:06.380 --> 28:09.426
- With 99.64% certainty.

28:09.470 --> 28:12.212
- He wasn't the guy?
- No, he wasn't the guy.

28:12.255 --> 28:13.735
- Sorry about that.

28:13.779 --> 28:16.477
- Sorry?

28:16.520 --> 28:18.348
- I told Crawford
this thing's still a year out.

28:18.392 --> 28:20.307
Six months, maybe.

28:20.350 --> 28:22.439
We're still running the code,
algorithms.

28:22.483 --> 28:24.572
And sometimes
this kind of thing happens.

28:24.615 --> 28:28.794
You get false positives.
It's rare but it happens.

28:28.837 --> 28:30.839
Mostly to black people.

28:30.883 --> 28:32.580
- What?

28:32.623 --> 28:35.714
- The code was written
by white engineers

28:35.757 --> 28:36.845
who designed it around

28:36.889 --> 28:38.717
predominantly white
facial features

28:38.760 --> 28:40.240
and tested it
on their white friends,

28:40.283 --> 28:42.895
so it's less precise
if you're black.

28:42.938 --> 28:45.549
And here's the really bad part.

28:45.593 --> 28:49.118
Darker your skin,
worse the problem gets.

28:49.162 --> 28:52.600
- You don't think that would've
been useful information for us

28:52.643 --> 28:55.646
before we go and use it
on a dark-skinned black man?

29:01.478 --> 29:05.134
- Marcus West
didn't kill those little boys?

29:05.178 --> 29:07.267
- We think
the killer's an insider.

29:07.310 --> 29:09.748
Remember the Hustlers?

29:09.791 --> 29:11.445
- All right,
let me get this straight.

29:11.488 --> 29:13.360
You drag West in,
you interrogate him,

29:13.403 --> 29:16.058
you don't have
enough evidence to charge,

29:16.102 --> 29:18.017
but you book him
into County anyway.

29:18.060 --> 29:19.409
- Detective Halstead
was convinced

29:19.453 --> 29:21.629
he killed those two boys.

29:21.672 --> 29:24.110
So yeah, we held him
for the full 48 hours.

29:24.153 --> 29:25.198
- So why book him into County?

29:25.241 --> 29:26.765
Why not hold him
at the 21st District?

29:26.808 --> 29:29.637
- Come on.
We do that all the time.

29:29.680 --> 29:33.032
As you know,
County's got a way of...

29:33.075 --> 29:35.077
encouraging people to confess.

29:35.121 --> 29:36.122
- Oh, yeah?

29:36.165 --> 29:37.210
But I assume
all the other times

29:37.253 --> 29:39.778
an innocent man
didn't end up dead?

29:39.821 --> 29:43.303
An innocent black man?

29:43.346 --> 29:46.697
Jesus Christ.

29:46.741 --> 29:48.351
All right, I--

29:48.395 --> 29:49.657
I'm gonna shoot straight
with you here, Hank.

29:49.700 --> 29:52.529
The optics on this,
not so good.

29:52.573 --> 29:54.967
White cop playing cowboy
jams up an innocent black man,

29:55.010 --> 29:57.230
throws him into County
for a crime he did not commit,

29:57.273 --> 29:59.972
and--

30:00.015 --> 30:04.411
I mean, someone's gonna
pay the tab on this.

30:04.454 --> 30:06.717
I mean, my money's on Halstead.

30:06.761 --> 30:08.850
- Really?

30:08.894 --> 30:10.983
That's funny,
'cause my money's on you.

30:11.026 --> 30:12.506
You're the one who told us

30:12.549 --> 30:14.943
to rely on
this fancy computer program

30:14.987 --> 30:16.684
that gave us the wrong guy.

30:16.727 --> 30:18.251
I mean, you staked your claim

30:18.294 --> 30:21.558
on a technology that's no good
at identifying black people.

30:21.602 --> 30:26.172
That's on you, not Halstead.

30:29.436 --> 30:32.352
- Well, I'd say we're all
in a pretty bad place, Hank.

30:32.395 --> 30:34.702
I mean, you're gonna
apprehend the real killer

30:34.745 --> 30:37.792
and then everybody's gonna know
that an innocent man is dead

30:37.836 --> 30:41.143
and they're gonna want
heads on pikes.

30:41.187 --> 30:43.580
Let me ask you a question.

30:43.624 --> 30:46.757
I mean, you got a play here?

30:49.978 --> 30:51.458
- All right, it's not Kareem.

30:51.501 --> 30:53.547
He's the boss, he's not
gonna steal from himself,

30:53.590 --> 30:55.723
plus one of these dead kids
is his nephew.

30:55.766 --> 30:56.898
- Right.

30:56.942 --> 30:59.031
Okay, so then
that leaves these four.

30:59.074 --> 31:00.423
They're the only ones who knew

31:00.467 --> 31:01.903
where the drugs and cash
were being held right?

31:01.947 --> 31:02.904
- Right.

31:02.948 --> 31:04.297
- So which one of them

31:04.340 --> 31:08.170
is cold-blooded enough
to murder two little kids?

31:08.214 --> 31:11.217
- That guy.

31:11.260 --> 31:12.914
"Prophet."

31:12.958 --> 31:15.569
Every step, he's been
throwing up road blocks

31:15.612 --> 31:17.571
trying to keep us
from the truth.

31:17.614 --> 31:20.052
First time we met, he told
Kareem not to talk to us,

31:20.095 --> 31:21.662
said we're
trying to entrap him,

31:21.705 --> 31:24.795
even though it's
their people got killed.

31:24.839 --> 31:26.928
That's my gut, anyway.

31:26.972 --> 31:28.321
- All right.

31:28.364 --> 31:30.801
Well, how do we prove it?

31:34.066 --> 31:35.328
- We know your boy

31:35.371 --> 31:38.766
Peter Dupree killed Marcus West
in lockup.

31:38.809 --> 31:42.030
- And I told you from the
start--I got people in pain,

31:42.074 --> 31:47.427
hungry for action, grown men
with minds of they own.

31:47.470 --> 31:49.559
- All those dudes in lockup,

31:49.603 --> 31:51.735
it's hard to imagine
no one saw anything.

31:51.779 --> 31:53.868
- Miracles.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.174
They do happen.

31:55.217 --> 31:58.133
- Yep.
That they do.

31:58.177 --> 32:01.441
Here's the thing, though.

32:01.484 --> 32:03.791
Marcus West didn't do it.

32:06.837 --> 32:09.971
I just wanted to let you know
as a courtesy.

32:10.015 --> 32:12.539
And we are still on it.

32:12.582 --> 32:14.671
And we are getting close.

32:17.196 --> 32:18.675
- I appreciate the info.
- Mm-hmm.

32:18.719 --> 32:21.591
- Yeah.
Uh-huh.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.902
- Walk with me.

32:30.600 --> 32:34.343
Listen, I didn't want to
lay this on the big man but...

32:34.387 --> 32:37.433
we've been doing some thinking.

32:37.477 --> 32:39.261
I mean--

32:39.305 --> 32:42.699
I mean, who kills a kid, right?
I mean, even in our world.

32:44.919 --> 32:48.531
There's only one reason someone
kills those kids in there.

32:50.446 --> 32:52.361
It's cause they
know who you are.

32:56.713 --> 32:57.976
I mean, you don't think

32:58.019 --> 32:59.499
any of your boys
do something like this, do you?

32:59.542 --> 33:00.500
Someone from your gang?

33:02.545 --> 33:05.070
- No way.
We like family.

33:05.113 --> 33:08.812
- Oh.
Well--

33:08.856 --> 33:12.729
it's a theory
and we gotta run it down, okay?

33:12.773 --> 33:14.340
So I'm coming to you man-to-man

33:14.383 --> 33:17.299
and I'm telling you, we are
gonna be knocking on some doors

33:17.343 --> 33:19.388
and I want
to knock on yours first.

33:19.432 --> 33:21.869
Listen--

33:21.912 --> 33:24.872
I just want you to show
your boys how to act, okay?

33:24.915 --> 33:27.266
There's no show.

33:27.309 --> 33:30.051
There's no guns,
no kicking in doors.

33:30.095 --> 33:31.618
So just be polite, okay?

33:31.661 --> 33:34.882
Just be part of this.

33:34.925 --> 33:37.406
I mean,
we want the same thing, right?

33:37.450 --> 33:39.191
Then we'll be out of your hair.

33:41.932 --> 33:44.892
- No problem, man.
Partners.

34:06.348 --> 34:09.047
- Okay, Prophet's inside
221 South Tripp.

34:09.090 --> 34:12.876
Assessor's office has the owner
listed as Olivia Jackson.

34:12.920 --> 34:14.748
- That's the same last name.
- Yeah.

34:14.791 --> 34:17.098
Hold on,
I've got LexisNexis cooking.

34:17.142 --> 34:18.099
Bingo.

34:18.143 --> 34:20.884
This is his sister's house.

34:20.928 --> 34:23.104
- Here he comes.

34:23.148 --> 34:24.584
Prophet's coming out.

34:30.111 --> 34:32.374
- Hey, he's got the bag.

34:41.601 --> 34:43.603
- He's on the move.

34:58.183 --> 34:59.706
- Yeah, he's coming our way.

35:01.838 --> 35:03.362
- Everybody sit tight.

35:03.405 --> 35:05.233
- Sarge,
we can end this right now.

35:05.277 --> 35:07.279
- I said stand down.

35:10.847 --> 35:12.545
- All right,
he said stand down.

35:19.204 --> 35:21.119
- Street's clear.

35:45.360 --> 35:46.622
- It's all here.
We got it.

36:04.771 --> 36:07.165
- Appreciate it.

36:10.951 --> 36:12.779
- We found the real killer.

36:12.822 --> 36:15.173
- Good.

36:15.216 --> 36:18.698
And not good.

36:18.741 --> 36:20.439
So was it an inside job?

36:20.482 --> 36:22.092
- Number two guy
in the Hustlers.

36:22.136 --> 36:25.226
Named Randolph Jackson,
goes by Prophet.

36:25.270 --> 36:27.010
Got him dead to rights.

36:32.277 --> 36:35.671
- So how do we do this?

36:35.715 --> 36:38.239
- Well...

36:38.283 --> 36:42.025
Not exactly what they teach you
in the academy,

36:42.069 --> 36:43.549
but it's a way out.

36:47.161 --> 36:51.252
For all of us.

37:00.522 --> 37:03.612
- You alone?

37:03.656 --> 37:05.875
- This ain't that movie.

37:09.488 --> 37:10.271
Easy.

37:14.971 --> 37:16.625
- What's this?
You punking me?

37:25.373 --> 37:27.636
How the hell
did you get this?

37:27.680 --> 37:28.507
- I stole it.

37:28.550 --> 37:29.899
- You stole it?
- Mm-hmm.

37:29.943 --> 37:32.467
- From where?

37:32.511 --> 37:35.862
- Prophet.

37:35.905 --> 37:37.472
- Prophet?

37:37.516 --> 37:41.737
- All I know is I saw Prophet
carrying your bag of belongings

37:41.781 --> 37:44.958
from his sister's house.

37:45.001 --> 37:48.004
Stashed it in some car
near an alley.

37:48.048 --> 37:51.878
You ask me,

37:51.921 --> 37:53.314
I think Prophet
ordered that hit

37:53.358 --> 37:55.925
on Marcus West at County, too.

37:57.884 --> 38:00.321
So I think about now
you gotta ask yourself...

38:03.803 --> 38:08.068
Is he capable of killing
two nine-year-old boys?

38:15.902 --> 38:19.166
- So what happens to Prophet?

38:19.209 --> 38:21.647
- That's your business,
isn't it?

38:25.694 --> 38:28.131
You trust me now?

38:35.182 --> 38:38.141
- What's up, man?

38:38.185 --> 38:39.839
- What up, Prophet?

38:39.882 --> 38:41.362
- Hey, hey--

39:04.429 --> 39:06.474
- We have identified
the man responsible

39:06.518 --> 39:07.867
for the execution-style
killing

39:07.910 --> 39:10.783
of three people
in North Lawndale,

39:10.826 --> 39:13.046
including
two nine-year-old boys.

39:15.222 --> 39:18.138
Perpetrator
has been identified as

39:18.181 --> 39:20.183
Marcus West.

39:20.227 --> 39:23.839
Mr. West had an extensive
criminal record.

39:23.883 --> 39:27.669
Multiple counts of burglaries,
narcotics, weapons.

39:27.713 --> 39:29.454
And he was located
through the use

39:29.497 --> 39:32.979
of a cutting-edge
facial recognition system,

39:33.022 --> 39:35.373
one we hope to take city-wide
in the next year

39:35.416 --> 39:37.679
after some fine tuning.

39:37.723 --> 39:41.596
Data-driven policing.
It works.

39:41.640 --> 39:43.119
And it works in a way

39:43.163 --> 39:45.731
that the people of this
great city can believe in.

39:45.774 --> 39:47.994
Now, after he was
taken into custody,

39:48.037 --> 39:50.779
Mr. West was assaulted
by rival gang members.

39:50.823 --> 39:53.478
He was placed into
a medically-induced coma,

39:53.521 --> 39:56.481
and, despite the dedicated work
of medical professionals,

39:56.524 --> 39:58.396
he succumbed to his injuries

39:58.439 --> 40:00.528
and he has been
pronounced dead.

40:00.572 --> 40:03.531
He was 27 years old.

40:03.575 --> 40:05.707
The CPD is confident
in its information

40:05.751 --> 40:09.102
and in this investigation.

40:09.145 --> 40:11.452
And this case
is considered closed.

40:22.463 --> 40:24.813
- Did you do
what I think you did?

40:28.077 --> 40:30.428
- Jay--

40:30.471 --> 40:34.083
for once in your life,

40:34.127 --> 40:37.086
just let it be.
