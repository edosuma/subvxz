Skyler, I'm so...

00:36.348 --> 00:39.228
Marie. Oh, Christ, Marie.
How...

00:41.625 --> 00:42.663
Oh, God.

00:43.423 --> 00:44.623
Oh, thank God.

00:45.638 --> 00:46.988
Is she beautiful?

00:51.260 --> 00:54.879
I'm staring at brake lights
on the 40.

00:55.279 --> 00:56.889
Some accident up ahead.

00:58.106 --> 01:00.017
Christ.
Today of all days, huh?

01:01.049 --> 01:04.061
Let her rest.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

01:22.526 --> 01:24.125
Excuse me.
Skyler White?

01:24.519 --> 01:25.319
307.

01:38.128 --> 01:40.328
Skyler, I'm so sorry.
I'm just...

01:40.899 --> 01:42.049
Are you okay?

01:45.861 --> 01:47.311
Meet your daughter.

01:58.846 --> 02:00.146
Hi, there, girl.

02:01.136 --> 02:02.486
Hi, there, Holly.

02:02.731 --> 02:04.331
Congratulations, Walt.

02:08.288 --> 02:10.439
I'm sorry, I didn't see you here.

02:11.006 --> 02:13.693
Ted drove me here.
Thank God.

02:13.818 --> 02:16.719
I mean, this little
bundle of joy of ours

02:16.887 --> 02:18.412
was practically on rails.

02:18.537 --> 02:22.534
Halfway here I thought he was gonna have
to pull over and deliver her himself.

02:24.689 --> 02:26.739
Then, I'm glad

02:27.496 --> 02:29.190
it didn't come to that.

02:32.057 --> 02:33.457
No problem at all.

02:34.490 --> 02:38.240
Well, let me get out of your way here
so you two can, you three,

02:38.507 --> 02:39.957
can be alone, okay?

02:40.339 --> 02:42.828
Listen, take it easy, Sky.

02:43.409 --> 02:45.357
I really...
I can't begin to thank you...

02:45.482 --> 02:48.119
Don't think anything of it.
It's my pleasure.

02:48.244 --> 02:49.794
Congratulations again.

02:49.962 --> 02:51.262
She's beautiful.

02:51.770 --> 02:54.170
- I'll talk to you soon.
- Take care.

03:05.127 --> 03:06.277
Are you okay?

03:06.560 --> 03:09.210
- Is everything okay?
- Everything's okay.

03:09.767 --> 03:11.667
I just wish you'd been here.

03:15.629 --> 03:17.170
Where's everyone else?

03:17.295 --> 03:18.265
Downstairs.

03:18.390 --> 03:20.157
Hank and Marie
took Junior for dinner.

03:20.282 --> 03:24.281
He has been such a trooper.
He even changed his first diaper.

03:28.458 --> 03:29.308
Did he?

03:32.587 --> 03:35.239
Honey, is there anything
that I can do for you?

03:35.364 --> 03:36.478
Anything at all?

03:36.603 --> 03:37.803
Actually, yes.

03:37.928 --> 03:40.456
I left my overnight bag
at home this morning.

03:40.581 --> 03:43.305
I think you get it in your head,
"C-section." You know?

03:43.773 --> 03:47.309
But I'm just so glad
the way it all worked out.

03:48.641 --> 03:50.146
Doing it natural instead.

03:50.271 --> 03:52.429
It just couldn't have
gone any better.

03:52.554 --> 03:53.354
Good.

03:57.009 --> 03:57.959
Let me...

03:59.316 --> 04:00.766
go get your things.

04:02.357 --> 04:03.407
And I'll...

04:04.462 --> 04:06.179
get my stuff, too, okay?

04:06.304 --> 04:07.788
I'll spend the night.

05:42.793 --> 05:43.593
Dad.

05:44.573 --> 05:46.073
I was in the shower.

05:48.136 --> 05:49.236
I overslept.

05:51.668 --> 05:54.018
I'm running late, but I'll be there.

06:01.383 --> 06:02.733
Baby, I gotta go.

06:21.479 --> 06:22.879
Somebody broke in.

06:44.857 --> 06:45.757
Come on.

06:46.795 --> 06:47.595
Damn.

06:51.278 --> 06:52.178
Oh, God.

06:54.337 --> 06:55.387
Oh, Christ.

07:01.097 --> 07:02.653
This week was tough.

07:02.778 --> 07:03.928
Toughest yet.

07:04.358 --> 07:05.508
You know why?

07:05.697 --> 07:07.426
I knew this day was coming.

07:07.851 --> 07:10.101
- My birthday.
- Your re-birthday?

07:10.323 --> 07:12.222
Yeah, and as it got closer,
it got worse.

07:12.475 --> 07:16.079
I was scared shitless I wouldn't
make it. I really didn't think I would.

07:16.204 --> 07:18.504
Called in sick three days in a row.

07:18.688 --> 07:20.538
I know my boss was pissed.

07:20.924 --> 07:23.817
I guess I don't really care.
I just didn't want to see anybody.

07:24.114 --> 07:25.668
You guys know how that is.

07:25.793 --> 07:27.666
All it'd take is one friend

07:27.791 --> 07:30.346
and I'd be out rippin'
and runnin' again.

07:30.471 --> 07:32.621
But I made it.
I really made it.

07:32.799 --> 07:34.949
I got one year clean to the day.

07:57.987 --> 08:00.354
You look tired.
Your eyes are kind of red.

08:00.522 --> 08:02.274
You getting enough sleep?

08:02.554 --> 08:03.649
Actually, no.

08:04.104 --> 08:06.804
I'm working on this
really complex new tat.

08:08.835 --> 08:12.825
A guy wants his whole back done up.
Him on his chopper, flames all around.

08:13.065 --> 08:16.748
I keep showing him the design
and he keeps asking for changes, like,

08:16.873 --> 08:18.972
"Give me more muscles.
Give me more flames."

08:19.097 --> 08:22.350
And I'm like, "A, this ain't
the Sistine Chapel.

08:22.475 --> 08:25.775
"And B, I have enough trouble
working around your zits."

08:26.651 --> 08:28.966
I really wish you wouldn't
work at that place.

08:29.228 --> 08:32.178
- You need to avoid those type of...
- I know...

08:32.621 --> 08:33.695
and I do.

08:36.472 --> 08:38.730
It's mostly college kids
and airmen from Kirtland.

08:38.855 --> 08:40.769
It's actually really corporate.

08:48.904 --> 08:50.354
So, how's your job?

08:50.931 --> 08:52.739
Oh, you know.
Same old, same old.

08:52.961 --> 08:55.242
Doing backup training
on my days off.

08:55.410 --> 08:57.143
God, they're hiring anybody now.

08:57.268 --> 08:59.288
No experience at all.
It's scary.

09:04.685 --> 09:06.285
You seeing anyone?

09:11.081 --> 09:11.881
You?

09:12.652 --> 09:14.678
What about that guy next door?

09:14.972 --> 09:16.221
What do you mean?

09:16.577 --> 09:18.858
Well, he seemed to have
some expectation

09:18.983 --> 09:20.701
of you introducing me to him.

09:20.826 --> 09:22.726
He knows you own the place.

09:25.076 --> 09:26.626
Dad, he's our tenant.

09:27.091 --> 09:28.241
End of story.

09:28.524 --> 09:31.024
Why would I get involved
with a tenant?

09:47.903 --> 09:49.403
Isn't she beautiful?

09:50.215 --> 09:53.165
I just think she's the most
beautiful baby ever.

09:53.652 --> 09:54.752
And why not?

09:55.423 --> 09:56.473
Good stock.

10:00.028 --> 10:01.128
I'll get it.

10:07.758 --> 10:09.008
Nobody's there.

10:13.635 --> 10:14.535
Beat ya!

10:18.016 --> 10:19.266
<i>Oh, hi, Carmen.</i>

10:19.822 --> 10:20.922
Just Carmen.

10:21.489 --> 10:23.839
- Come on. Hurry up.
- So you heard?

10:25.083 --> 10:27.501
<i>Good news.
She's just so beautiful.</i>

10:28.818 --> 10:29.918
Well, Holly.

10:30.330 --> 10:32.038
<i>7 pounds, 3 ounces.</i>

10:32.451 --> 10:34.822
Everybody is doing just fine.

10:35.384 --> 10:37.886
You junkie imbecile.
What are you calling this number for?

10:38.100 --> 10:40.171
I am trying to tell you, man.

10:40.498 --> 10:43.251
Last night, somebody
broke in my place, yo.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.977
- <i>I got robbed.</i>
- What?

10:45.366 --> 10:47.187
Somebody, they got all of our...

10:47.771 --> 10:48.913
<i>our stuff.</i>

10:49.981 --> 10:50.981
All of it.

10:53.632 --> 10:55.309
You get me, Mr. White?

10:56.162 --> 10:58.115
<i>The blue stuff.
It's, like, uncanny.</i>

10:58.283 --> 11:00.383
They new exactly where to look!

11:01.178 --> 11:04.329
I mean, say something, man!
Yell at me or something! Come on!

11:09.043 --> 11:09.843
God!

11:26.139 --> 11:28.963
Hank, come on!
People are starving to death out here!

11:29.088 --> 11:31.638
All right, all right.
Had to get a beer.

11:33.008 --> 11:34.779
All right, guys.
Here we go.

11:34.904 --> 11:38.488
We got mild, medium
and <i>muy caliente</i>.

11:39.043 --> 11:40.805
I got dibs on the breast.

11:41.235 --> 11:44.524
- Los Pollos Hermanos?
- Yeah, seriously. You gotta try it.

11:44.996 --> 11:47.696
This joint gives KFC
a run for their money.

11:48.148 --> 11:49.598
That baby's hungry.

11:50.168 --> 11:51.568
Give me that baby.

11:52.174 --> 11:53.274
Aw, sweetie.

11:56.600 --> 11:59.634
Come on. Jeez, Sky.
Not at the table. We're eating.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.137
Hank, it's only a breast.

12:02.305 --> 12:05.390
- It's my sister-in-law's breast.
- You are so provincial.

12:07.560 --> 12:11.410
Remember the day when you were talking
to me about child-proofing?

12:11.981 --> 12:14.631
What are you thinking?
A fence or a cover?

12:14.951 --> 12:18.711
Actually, I was thinking
more of an alarm system.

12:18.836 --> 12:22.749
They've got these new systems out there,
"sonar systems" that would...

12:22.874 --> 12:25.724
anything falls into it,
it sets the alarm off.

12:26.431 --> 12:28.031
That sounds expensive.

12:28.694 --> 12:30.094
Well, yeah, but...

12:30.558 --> 12:32.709
for the baby, I mean...

12:33.234 --> 12:34.169
Why don't...

12:35.148 --> 12:37.414
Why don't you let
Marie and I get that for you guys?

12:37.539 --> 12:38.589
Absolutely.

12:40.263 --> 12:42.713
No, please.
I'll be back at work soon.

12:42.949 --> 12:44.549
We'll take care of it.

12:44.805 --> 12:46.205
Back at work soon?

12:47.588 --> 12:50.533
Since you're scheduled
for surgery, I just thought

12:50.770 --> 12:53.970
it might be a good idea
to have some money coming in.

12:57.196 --> 13:00.546
Skyler, we need to think
about what's best for the baby.

13:00.846 --> 13:04.820
And I think having her mother around
for at least the first few years...

13:05.975 --> 13:07.172
Money-wise,

13:07.832 --> 13:10.080
we'll manage.
I promise you that.

13:10.394 --> 13:14.127
What? You guys got a printing press
in the garage churning out 50s?

13:14.252 --> 13:15.168
I wish.

13:15.535 --> 13:17.916
Mom's even talking
about me getting a job.

13:18.041 --> 13:20.557
That's right.
Everybody pitches in.

13:22.216 --> 13:24.216
Why don't we ever get Chinese?

13:32.351 --> 13:33.501
I'll get her.

13:34.556 --> 13:35.706
I'll get her.

13:46.271 --> 13:47.413
Good girl.

13:48.400 --> 13:49.859
That's a good girl.

13:50.769 --> 13:52.269
My little girl, huh?

14:06.629 --> 14:08.629
Do you want to see something?

14:09.611 --> 14:10.611
Come here.

14:12.183 --> 14:13.633
Oh. I know, I know.

14:29.611 --> 14:32.361
You want to see what
your daddy did for you?

14:34.732 --> 14:36.032
Let me show you.

14:37.375 --> 14:38.675
Here. Come here.

14:41.876 --> 14:42.976
Want to see?

14:56.418 --> 14:57.568
That's right.

14:58.961 --> 15:00.211
Daddy did that.

15:06.903 --> 15:08.553
Daddy did that for you.

15:18.466 --> 15:20.716
This place looks exactly the same.

15:21.485 --> 15:24.506
Why don't you have computers and shit?
It's the 20th century.

15:25.053 --> 15:26.968
What the hell are you doing here?

15:27.093 --> 15:28.709
You took the stash!

15:28.886 --> 15:31.303
I heard all those phone messages
and I figured it out.

15:31.428 --> 15:34.259
You figured it out?
Congratulations, Einstein.

15:34.384 --> 15:36.518
You left me to freak out
all day long,

15:36.686 --> 15:39.437
like I dropped the ball!
And you were the one who took it!

15:39.605 --> 15:41.103
Shut up.

15:42.365 --> 15:43.915
You lower your voice.

15:49.305 --> 15:51.365
"Like" you dropped the ball?

15:51.722 --> 15:55.079
When have you ever
not dropped the ball, Jesse?

15:55.723 --> 15:58.123
Blasted out of your mind
on whatever the hell that was.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.491
What was that?

16:00.430 --> 16:01.280
Heroin?

16:03.618 --> 16:04.418
Jesus.

16:05.195 --> 16:07.653
I was on my day off.
What I do on my day off...

16:07.778 --> 16:10.149
Day off? We were on-call,
you junkie.

16:10.274 --> 16:12.262
On-call for the biggest
deal of our lives.

16:12.430 --> 16:16.033
And I just managed to pull it off by
the skin of my teeth, no thanks to you.

16:16.158 --> 16:19.351
You made me miss
the birth of my daughter.

16:22.797 --> 16:24.047
Son of a bitch.

16:27.124 --> 16:28.069
How much?

16:29.367 --> 16:30.495
How much what?

16:30.620 --> 16:32.870
How much did you get for the deal?

16:36.539 --> 16:37.738
1.2 million.

16:39.861 --> 16:41.137
600,000 each.

16:41.567 --> 16:43.080
480,000.

16:43.824 --> 16:45.224
Saul's cut is 20%.

16:47.993 --> 16:49.543
So, where's my money?

16:51.204 --> 16:52.010
What?

16:54.487 --> 16:56.087
You are joking, right?

16:58.572 --> 17:00.258
If I gave you that money,

17:01.069 --> 17:03.146
you would be dead inside of a week.

17:06.223 --> 17:07.973
Look, I'm off the heroin.

17:08.207 --> 17:11.057
I didn't even like it anyway.
It made me sick.

17:11.906 --> 17:13.656
And the... And the meth.

17:14.267 --> 17:16.838
You know, I can take it or leave it.

17:17.570 --> 17:19.121
I'm clean, Mr. White.

17:20.308 --> 17:21.258
For real.

17:33.842 --> 17:34.678
Prove it.

17:35.014 --> 17:36.114
Pee in that.

17:36.474 --> 17:39.124
- How gay are you? Seriously.
- Pee in it.

17:39.521 --> 17:41.810
They're selling testing kits
at the drug stores.

17:42.101 --> 17:45.151
If you are clean,
I will give you every last dime.

17:46.992 --> 17:47.857
No, huh?

17:49.095 --> 17:50.895
Well, I guess, until then,

17:51.020 --> 17:54.970
you'll just have to depend on
the kindness of strangers to get high.

17:55.095 --> 17:57.794
That and your little
junkie girlfriend.

18:25.644 --> 18:27.294
Not on her tummy, Walt.

18:27.419 --> 18:29.619
I'm not putting her on her tummy.

18:30.503 --> 18:33.803
I'll put her on her side.
Do you want to hold her back?

18:35.183 --> 18:37.574
Just in case she decides
to do a little spit-up,

18:37.742 --> 18:41.717
I'll roll up a nice clean towel
like this and put it under.

18:43.497 --> 18:46.138
Hammacher Schlemmer
makes a proper one of those.

18:46.263 --> 18:47.813
It's hypo-allergenic.

18:49.984 --> 18:51.684
I think a towel will do.

18:54.884 --> 18:55.934
What is it?

18:57.691 --> 18:58.641
Your son.

18:59.263 --> 19:01.806
He's just unbelievable.
Come see what he did.

19:07.271 --> 19:09.114
I told you it's not ready yet.

19:09.239 --> 19:11.189
Honey, just show it to them.

19:30.869 --> 19:32.919
My God, son.
That's wonderful.

19:35.148 --> 19:36.841
This is beautiful.

19:38.278 --> 19:40.191
SaveWalterWhite.com.

19:42.139 --> 19:44.639
Well, I, for one,
am telling everybody.

19:46.060 --> 19:47.260
Wait a minute.

19:47.476 --> 19:50.126
You're not asking for money,
are you, son?

19:50.395 --> 19:52.106
That's the whole idea.

19:52.274 --> 19:55.443
Louis helped me set up
a PayPal account and everything.

19:56.856 --> 19:58.706
But we can't ask for money.

20:06.947 --> 20:09.235
I appreciate it.
I really do.

20:15.085 --> 20:16.685
This was all his idea.

20:16.893 --> 20:18.593
He worked so hard on it.

20:19.165 --> 20:20.565
Just let him help.

20:22.532 --> 20:24.732
You can't ask him to take it down.

20:25.196 --> 20:26.485
It'll crush him.

20:27.228 --> 20:28.378
It's charity.

20:31.781 --> 20:34.431
Why do you say that
like it's some sort of

20:34.626 --> 20:35.699
dirty word?

20:46.495 --> 20:48.117
This is insane.

20:48.509 --> 20:50.409
I have so much cash on-hand

20:50.728 --> 20:53.830
that I actually count it
by weighing it on my bathroom scale.

20:53.955 --> 20:57.255
And yet, I can't spend it.
I can't tell my family about it.

20:57.586 --> 21:01.136
All of whom think that I am
right on the edge of bankruptcy.

21:02.793 --> 21:03.845
It's insane.

21:04.592 --> 21:07.098
Well, I guess that's
why gangsters had molls.

21:07.851 --> 21:08.651
What?

21:09.434 --> 21:10.434
Gun molls.

21:10.906 --> 21:12.812
Haven't you ever seen <i>White Heat</i> ?

21:13.990 --> 21:17.397
I've seen <i>White Heat</i>,
but I don't see how that pertains.

21:17.522 --> 21:19.907
Maybe you need a moll
more than you need a wife

21:20.032 --> 21:22.158
who you can't trust
with your secrets.

21:22.283 --> 21:25.992
What good is money that doesn't spend?
If a tree falls in the forest...

21:26.388 --> 21:27.788
You get the point.

21:28.029 --> 21:29.704
So communicating is out?

21:31.181 --> 21:31.981
Out.

21:32.301 --> 21:34.038
Well, let's see.
What else is there?

21:34.163 --> 21:36.696
There's always,
"Hey, I found a big bag of money

21:36.821 --> 21:38.821
"down by the railroad tracks."

21:39.548 --> 21:40.698
Works for me.

21:42.095 --> 21:43.051
Uncle Murray.

21:46.763 --> 21:50.464
"Oh, many is the happy memory
of Uncle Murray bouncing me on his knee.

21:50.589 --> 21:53.102
"We lost track of
the old pervert years ago,

21:53.270 --> 21:56.720
"but what do you know?
He kicked it and left me millions."

21:56.883 --> 21:59.567
It cannot be blind luck or some

21:59.943 --> 22:01.986
imaginary relative who saves us.

22:02.477 --> 22:04.502
I earned that money, me.

22:05.581 --> 22:07.716
And now my son created
his own website...

22:07.841 --> 22:11.704
"SaveWalterWhite.com..."
soliciting anonymous donations.

22:11.957 --> 22:14.707
Do you have any idea
how that makes me feel?

22:19.584 --> 22:22.684
Yeah, look at that.
It's got PayPal and everything.

22:23.164 --> 22:25.637
Cyber-begging.
That's all that is.

22:26.715 --> 22:29.681
Just rattling a little tin cup
to the entire world.

22:29.975 --> 22:32.475
Yeah, there's no deep-seated
issues there.

22:33.757 --> 22:36.318
I'm looking at the answer here.
It's staring me in the face.

22:36.443 --> 22:38.773
- Do I have to spell it out for you?
- No, I know.

22:39.024 --> 22:41.270
You're thinking that I should be
funneling my money

22:41.395 --> 22:43.695
into my son's website,
but absolutely not, no.

22:44.052 --> 22:46.800
I am not going to have
my family think that some

22:46.925 --> 22:49.196
mystery benefactor saved us.

22:49.321 --> 22:52.325
Not some mystery
benefactor, singular.

22:52.450 --> 22:56.400
That would raise too many questions.
However... stay with me here...

22:57.170 --> 22:58.200
Zombies.

23:00.588 --> 23:03.631
I got a guy who knows this guy
who knows this <i>Rain Man</i>-type.

23:03.972 --> 23:07.200
He lives with his mother
in her basement in Belarus.

23:07.599 --> 23:10.346
So good luck extraditing
his fat Russian ass.

23:10.674 --> 23:11.478
Wait.

23:11.603 --> 23:14.116
He's a hacker-cracker
extraordinaire.

23:14.241 --> 23:17.035
This guy can hijack random desktops

23:17.160 --> 23:20.690
all around the world, turn 'em into
zombies that do his bidding.

23:21.021 --> 23:22.203
For instance,

23:22.328 --> 23:25.561
he can make it so, 20 or 30,000

23:25.686 --> 23:28.948
little donations come in
from all over the U.S. and Canada.

23:29.508 --> 23:31.464
10, 20, 50 bucks a pop,

23:31.589 --> 23:34.829
all paid in-full, nice and neat,
untraceable,

23:34.954 --> 23:38.819
from the good-hearted people
of the world to Mr. Walter H. White,

23:39.168 --> 23:40.318
Cancer Saint.

23:41.295 --> 23:44.845
I'm getting a warm and fuzzy feeling
just thinking about it.

23:48.719 --> 23:52.598
He's an asshole, that's what.
Always judging me.

23:54.577 --> 23:55.850
Not too much.

23:56.325 --> 23:58.860
I mean, like...
like, who's he, right?

23:58.985 --> 24:01.085
I mean, first off, I taught him.

24:01.722 --> 24:04.822
He's always acting like
I'm his indentured servant.

24:15.662 --> 24:16.912
Now the cotton.

24:23.277 --> 24:24.127
Needle?

24:26.548 --> 24:29.548
- I don't understand why you need him.
- Exactly.

24:31.030 --> 24:33.442
My point exactly.

24:43.568 --> 24:47.406
Flat against your skin
so it doesn't wiggle around too much.

24:51.739 --> 24:53.889
How much does he owe you, anyway?

24:55.502 --> 24:56.796
480.

24:57.850 --> 25:01.350
Well, hell, I'd be mad, too,
if somebody owed me 500 bucks.

25:04.382 --> 25:06.087
480,000.

25:07.985 --> 25:08.785
What?

25:11.384 --> 25:12.184
What?

25:13.270 --> 25:14.270
Thousand.

25:16.972 --> 25:19.125
Not on your back, baby.
In case you throw up.

25:19.250 --> 25:21.450
On your side.
Sleep on your side.

25:30.934 --> 25:32.113
She's all like,

25:32.381 --> 25:36.099
"Don't preach to me." And I'm like,
"Baby, I'm not preaching to you.

25:36.224 --> 25:38.974
"I'm talking about basic survival,
you know?

25:39.147 --> 25:41.600
"I'm conversing
about life and death."

25:42.137 --> 25:44.837
I mean, this here,
what we've been doing...

25:45.025 --> 25:46.753
Hell, Becky knows.

25:53.014 --> 25:53.814
Dad?

25:54.595 --> 25:56.554
I overslept.
I'm on my way.

26:11.098 --> 26:11.898
Dad?

26:14.217 --> 26:15.114
Dad, wait.

26:15.771 --> 26:17.671
It's not what it looks like.

26:22.447 --> 26:25.497
Dad, just wait.
Let me talk to you for one second.

26:27.321 --> 26:28.221
Come on!

26:36.732 --> 26:39.207
Stop it!
Don't touch him, Dad!

26:39.332 --> 26:41.682
- Son of a bitch.
- Dad, let him go!

26:46.129 --> 26:48.690
Get away from me, man.
Back off.

26:49.263 --> 26:51.449
- Back off!
- Everybody just calm down!

26:51.574 --> 26:53.140
What's with you, yo?

26:53.265 --> 26:56.596
- 'Cause I'll seriously bust you up.
- You miserable little smackhead.

26:56.721 --> 26:59.064
- Get the hell out!
- Hey, I pay my rent, bitch!

26:59.325 --> 27:00.775
I got civil rights!

27:02.515 --> 27:04.914
Jesse, come on.
Please, no. Come on.

27:05.786 --> 27:07.174
I pay my rent.

27:09.900 --> 27:12.312
You're going back to rehab.
Today. Now.

27:12.437 --> 27:14.924
Look, as it so happens,
we were just...

27:15.049 --> 27:17.442
we were just talking
about that and...

27:17.567 --> 27:20.356
And I was gonna tell you, okay?
If you would just let me.

27:20.481 --> 27:21.678
18 months.

27:22.023 --> 27:25.268
You have been clean for 18 months, Jane.
Why? Why do you do it?

27:26.909 --> 27:28.458
I backslid, okay?

27:29.442 --> 27:30.492
Like, what?

27:30.752 --> 27:32.952
What, you think I'm proud of this?

27:33.192 --> 27:34.942
Like, I do it on purpose?

27:35.312 --> 27:36.412
Lying to me,

27:36.863 --> 27:39.604
shacking up and using
with this scumbag, this loser!

27:39.729 --> 27:41.327
It takes one to know one!

27:41.452 --> 27:44.203
His name is Jesse, and you don't know
the first thing about him.

27:44.712 --> 27:47.306
We talk about rehab every night.
It's his idea.

27:47.431 --> 27:50.084
You talk about rehab?
Well, gee, isn't that wonderful?

27:51.017 --> 27:53.132
Thank you for not being judgmental

27:53.257 --> 27:54.862
24 hours a day.

27:55.532 --> 27:59.260
'Cause that's exactly what I need,
to be judged all the time!

28:02.685 --> 28:04.965
You know what you need?
I'll tell you exactly.

28:05.090 --> 28:06.323
What are you doing?

28:06.448 --> 28:08.978
- What are you doing?
- I am calling the police.

28:10.833 --> 28:11.733
Come on!

28:13.150 --> 28:14.027
Dad, don't.

28:14.234 --> 28:17.155
I have tried ten years
of love and understanding.

28:17.280 --> 28:20.281
Maybe what it takes
is you drying out in a jail cell.

28:22.143 --> 28:25.453
I would like to report drug use
in a building that I own.

28:26.413 --> 28:28.188
- No. It's on-going.
- Daddy.

28:28.313 --> 28:30.875
It's illegal activity.
I'd like to talk to somebody.

28:31.336 --> 28:33.753
- Would you connect me, please?
- Fine, we'll go to rehab.

28:34.259 --> 28:36.279
I could care less
about him going to rehab.

28:36.404 --> 28:38.936
- I want you in rehab.
- Okay. I'll go first thing tomorrow.

28:39.061 --> 28:40.926
Not tomorrow. Today.

28:41.178 --> 28:44.036
I have to call into work.
I have to stop the newspaper.

28:44.161 --> 28:46.562
The last time I went to rehab,
all my houseplants died

28:46.687 --> 28:48.935
because you didn't water them, so...

28:52.464 --> 28:53.314
Please?

28:54.336 --> 28:55.236
I'll go.

28:58.912 --> 28:59.862
Tomorrow.

29:06.558 --> 29:08.079
I'm sorry.
I made a mistake.

29:14.180 --> 29:15.180
Tomorrow.

29:33.514 --> 29:34.964
You meant all that?

29:37.093 --> 29:38.427
I don't know.

29:39.595 --> 29:41.895
I just think if we had enough money,

29:43.038 --> 29:45.188
nobody could make us do anything.

30:15.260 --> 30:16.610
Just let it ring.

30:16.855 --> 30:18.905
No, I'm gonna go see who it is.

30:21.079 --> 30:22.429
It's okay, Holly.

30:26.610 --> 30:30.538
Good luck with that. But I'm sure
he'd be glad to, write some...

30:31.561 --> 30:35.326
Actually, here he is right now.
So hold on a second.

30:36.879 --> 30:38.502
- What?
- It's one of your...

30:38.788 --> 30:42.438
one of your old students.
He wants a letter of recommendation.

30:46.656 --> 30:49.576
Honey,
I think the baby is getting hungry.

30:50.871 --> 30:52.192
This is Walter White.

30:58.218 --> 31:00.879
I'm sorry.
I'm having a little trouble recalling...

31:01.004 --> 31:02.049
It's Jane.

31:02.625 --> 31:04.361
You know, of Jesse and Jane.

31:04.668 --> 31:06.518
<i>Jesse's "junkie girlfriend."</i>

31:07.570 --> 31:11.246
Of course.
It really has been a long time.

31:11.371 --> 31:12.828
Get somewhere you can talk.

31:13.134 --> 31:14.134
Sure. Yes.

31:15.002 --> 31:17.462
I am looking into that as we speak.

31:20.530 --> 31:23.714
How the hell did you get this number?
Did Jesse give it to you?

31:23.946 --> 31:26.773
All Jesse wants
is what's coming to him.

31:27.031 --> 31:28.616
No more, no less.

31:28.830 --> 31:30.336
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

31:30.461 --> 31:31.931
480,000.

31:36.056 --> 31:37.663
He told you about the money.

31:37.788 --> 31:39.388
<i>He told me everything.</i>

31:43.963 --> 31:46.304
So, what is this?

31:48.829 --> 31:50.961
Some kind of blackmail or something?

31:51.086 --> 31:54.620
This is me telling you to do right by
Jesse and bring him what you owe him.

31:54.927 --> 31:56.466
<i>I don't call that blackmail.</i>

31:56.591 --> 31:59.477
<i>I call that you getting off your ass,
and being a decent human being.</i>

31:59.602 --> 32:01.393
Well, I call it blackmail.

32:01.713 --> 32:04.500
Dialing my number.
Talking to my wife.

32:06.717 --> 32:08.884
<i>And what's your end of this?
How much heroin</i>

32:09.052 --> 32:11.252
does a half a million dollars buy?

32:12.493 --> 32:13.711
For your information,

32:13.836 --> 32:17.601
<i>I am holding Jesse's money for him,
he will receive every last dollar of it.</i>

32:17.773 --> 32:19.243
He will... not you...

32:19.663 --> 32:21.331
at a time when I see fit.

32:21.456 --> 32:23.774
But I will not contribute
to his overdose.

32:24.511 --> 32:26.694
<i>Now, you tell him,
if he gets clean...</i>

32:26.862 --> 32:28.864
- If you both get clean...
- <i> You know what?</i>

32:29.072 --> 32:32.491
I take that back. This is blackmail.
Because what I know about you...

32:32.720 --> 32:36.064
<i>High school teacher turned drug dealer
with a brother-in-law in the DEA...</i>

32:36.189 --> 32:38.142
<i>that'd make one hell of a story.</i>

32:38.267 --> 32:39.665
<i>National news, I'll bet.</i>

32:40.716 --> 32:43.011
Do right by Jesse tonight

32:43.136 --> 32:45.286
or I will burn you to the ground.

32:53.873 --> 32:54.680
Shit.

32:56.403 --> 32:59.226
He's a high school teacher.
What's he gonna do? Give you a B-minus?

32:59.394 --> 33:01.794
Send you outside
to clap the erasers?

33:03.732 --> 33:07.241
You wouldn't really
go to the cops, would you?

33:08.377 --> 33:10.237
We won't have to.
He'll pay.

33:11.703 --> 33:13.098
What if he doesn't?

33:13.223 --> 33:14.873
Jesse, it's your money.

33:15.049 --> 33:17.011
You're in the right here.
He's in the wrong.

33:17.136 --> 33:19.016
He's not stupid.
He'll pay.

33:24.055 --> 33:25.505
What is it, really?

33:26.043 --> 33:28.464
You don't want
your half a million dollars?

33:28.589 --> 33:32.239
You wanna renounce your earthly
possessions and become a monk?

33:33.991 --> 33:37.279
It's just,
I'm not the kind of dude who rolls.

33:37.898 --> 33:40.368
And by extension, neither are you.

33:46.640 --> 33:48.340
I mean, he's my partner.

33:52.185 --> 33:53.535
I'm your partner.

34:11.263 --> 34:13.362
<i>Close your eyes and go to sleep.</i>

34:26.652 --> 34:29.431
<i>If that mockingbird won't sing</i>

34:30.052 --> 34:33.203
<i>Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring</i>

34:33.900 --> 34:37.217
<i>If that diamond ring turns brass</i>

34:37.841 --> 34:41.154
<i>Mama's gonna buy you a looking glass</i>

34:41.746 --> 34:45.199
<i>So hush, little baby Don't you cry</i>

34:45.722 --> 34:49.313
<i>Daddy loves you and so do I</i>

35:05.796 --> 35:08.718
She's finally asleep.

35:13.517 --> 35:16.494
What are you doing?
Learning about elephants?

35:28.124 --> 35:31.376
Honey, we're out of diapers.
Would you mind going out?

36:10.940 --> 36:11.840
Not you.

36:26.329 --> 36:28.143
Nice job wearing the pants.

36:35.339 --> 36:37.402
How do I know she'll keep quiet?

36:38.139 --> 36:39.539
I guess you don't.

36:43.326 --> 36:45.976
You'll never hear
from either of us again.

36:48.613 --> 36:50.813
You're not seeing straight, Jesse.

36:52.128 --> 36:53.878
You are making a mistake.

37:09.489 --> 37:12.145
- Do you know what this is?
- It's a whole lot of cheddar.

37:12.313 --> 37:13.613
This is freedom.

37:14.256 --> 37:17.091
This is saying,
"I can go anywhere I want.

37:17.216 --> 37:18.786
"I can be anybody."

37:19.783 --> 37:21.335
What do you want to be?

37:21.460 --> 37:24.575
Where do you want to go?
South America? Europe? Australia?

37:24.826 --> 37:28.142
- Is New Zealand part of Australia?
- New Zealand is New Zealand.

37:28.267 --> 37:29.217
Right on.

37:29.520 --> 37:32.740
New Zealand. That's where
they made <i>Lord of the Rings</i>.

37:32.865 --> 37:35.544
I say we just move there, yo.
I mean, you can do your art.

37:35.956 --> 37:38.692
Right? Like, you can paint
the local castles and shit

37:38.817 --> 37:40.757
And I can be a bush pilot.

37:41.206 --> 37:43.506
New Zealand.
I can get behind that.

37:43.978 --> 37:47.528
But I guess I'm good anywhere
as long as it's the two of us.

37:55.098 --> 37:57.006
But first we gotta get clean.

37:57.131 --> 37:59.178
And not because
anybody's telling us to.

37:59.303 --> 38:01.053
We do this for us, right?

38:02.077 --> 38:03.127
Absolutely.

38:03.354 --> 38:04.982
- For us.
- All this here...

38:05.107 --> 38:07.216
We're not gonna just shoot
this up our arms.

38:07.341 --> 38:08.462
We're not.

38:08.587 --> 38:09.614
Hell, no.

38:09.739 --> 38:11.364
We're better than that.

38:11.489 --> 38:13.839
We're way better than that.
I say...

38:14.133 --> 38:17.836
I say we flush what we've got left
and we start tonight.

38:21.429 --> 38:22.755
We can do that.

38:23.940 --> 38:25.056
Definitely.

38:29.893 --> 38:30.893
Excuse me.

38:40.087 --> 38:41.537
What can I get you?

38:42.973 --> 38:45.403
Give me a Fat Tire draft, please.

38:52.129 --> 38:53.029
Damn it.

38:56.558 --> 38:57.608
Hey, honey.

38:58.711 --> 39:00.911
No. I don't know what to tell you.

39:01.263 --> 39:05.253
Three stores I've been to so far,
and not one of them have it in stock.

39:06.892 --> 39:09.442
Do they have
to be diapers for newborns?

39:09.603 --> 39:12.403
What if we went up
a size and just kind of...

39:13.257 --> 39:15.207
All right.
No, I understand.

39:15.435 --> 39:18.335
All right. I'll just...
I'll just keep looking.

39:18.644 --> 39:21.505
I'm pulling into Wal-Mart now, so...

39:30.533 --> 39:31.633
Well played.

39:41.985 --> 39:43.735
They found water on Mars.

39:45.774 --> 39:46.958
They have indeed.

39:47.083 --> 39:49.404
Don't exactly know what to do
with that information,

39:49.529 --> 39:51.555
but God bless 'em, they found it.

39:56.015 --> 39:57.218
Actually, they

39:57.522 --> 40:01.057
theoretically can separate
the hydrogen from the oxygen

40:01.311 --> 40:05.086
and process that into providing
fuel for man's space flights.

40:05.630 --> 40:09.188
Ostensibly turning Mars into
a giant gas station.

40:10.216 --> 40:11.366
So, it's a...

40:14.154 --> 40:15.996
We live in an amazing time.

40:17.222 --> 40:18.928
To water on Mars.

40:20.283 --> 40:21.543
To water on Mars.

40:24.698 --> 40:26.196
So, what'd you have?

40:26.321 --> 40:27.421
Girl or boy?

40:29.146 --> 40:30.346
A little girl.

40:30.756 --> 40:31.856
That's nice.

40:32.263 --> 40:33.563
Congratulations.

40:34.182 --> 40:35.582
I have a daughter.

40:36.934 --> 40:37.834
How old?

40:38.728 --> 40:40.528
Old enough to know better.

40:40.881 --> 40:42.081
27 next month.

40:45.259 --> 40:46.759
You have other kids?

40:47.058 --> 40:48.208
Just the one.

40:50.010 --> 40:51.860
I've got a 16-year-old boy.

40:52.067 --> 40:53.841
Well, he's almost 16.

40:56.243 --> 40:57.593
There's a spread.

40:59.887 --> 41:03.837
But he helps out, though. He's even
changing some diapers now, so...

41:04.296 --> 41:07.346
It's more than I managed
to do when I was his age.

41:08.562 --> 41:10.812
Kids today grow up faster, I think.

41:12.864 --> 41:13.860
Maybe so.

41:16.475 --> 41:17.725
So, any advice?

41:18.991 --> 41:20.310
Having a daughter.

41:20.561 --> 41:21.611
Any advice?

41:23.023 --> 41:24.116
Not really.

41:24.396 --> 41:25.646
Just love them.

41:26.032 --> 41:26.882
Just...

41:27.996 --> 41:29.246
I mean, they...

41:29.589 --> 41:31.189
they are who they are.

41:35.595 --> 41:36.895
I've got this...

41:38.172 --> 41:39.022
nephew.

41:42.717 --> 41:45.467
This nephew who is...
I mean, he's an adult.

41:47.386 --> 41:49.464
But you can't infantilize them,

41:49.589 --> 41:51.839
you can't live their life for them.

41:53.165 --> 41:54.845
But still, I mean, there is

41:55.635 --> 41:56.985
that frustration.

41:58.544 --> 42:01.244
God, that frustration
that goes along with,

42:02.213 --> 42:06.064
"Yes, as a matter of fact, I do know
what is best for you, so listen."

42:08.317 --> 42:10.117
But of course, they don't.

42:12.535 --> 42:14.985
What do you do with
someone like that?

42:15.855 --> 42:16.705
Family.

42:22.018 --> 42:22.939
Family.

42:24.290 --> 42:26.490
You can't give up on them.
Never.

42:27.228 --> 42:29.172
I mean, what else is there?

43:17.377 --> 43:18.277
It's me!

43:26.182 --> 43:27.682
I just want to talk.

44:35.378 --> 44:36.256
Wake up.

44:37.644 --> 44:38.544
Wake up.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
