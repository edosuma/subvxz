Whoa, that didn't
make any sense.

(GIGGLING) But that is
what was previously on.

00:39.606 --> 00:42.307
Uh, shouldn't we have
shown how the guys
were captured by The Brain

00:42.309 --> 00:45.944
and we put together a group
of cool girls to rescue them?

00:45.946 --> 00:48.947
Now, the most
exciting of conclusions.

00:51.317 --> 00:54.252
Remember the plan.
We break into
The Brain's fortress,

00:54.254 --> 00:55.954

Of course we remember.

00:57.825 --> 01:00.325
We just went over this,
like, two seconds ago.

01:00.327 --> 01:02.094
Do you think we're dummies?

01:02.096 --> 01:05.063
I guess I did just say
it two seconds ago.
It felt longer.

01:43.604 --> 01:46.004
That's the dance I'll be doing
on the Titans' graves!

01:46.439 --> 01:48.206
Excuse me?

01:48.208 --> 01:52.077
Uh, I mean, I'm really
looking forward to
those milkshakes.

01:52.079 --> 01:54.846
Oh, me too! Pa-pa-pa-pa!

01:55.948 --> 01:59.418
This is not how I wanted
to spend my last years.

01:59.420 --> 02:01.887
Don't worry, old me.
I have a new plan.

02:01.889 --> 02:03.822
Does it involve time machines?

02:03.824 --> 02:05.657
You bet it does!

02:05.659 --> 02:09.561
Oh, yeah! I wanna hear
what this mad scientist
came up with this time, yo!

02:09.563 --> 02:13.131
It's simple. We sit here
until the old us die...

02:13.133 --> 02:15.867
...and then our ghosts
will grab a time machine

02:15.869 --> 02:18.170
and come back to rescue us!

02:18.172 --> 02:19.604

chance to break as much

I like that.

I'd like you to stop!

03:02.449 --> 03:03.882
Whatever.

03:07.820 --> 03:09.955
Okay, I need a distraction.

03:09.957 --> 03:12.491
Star, act as bait and
draw the guards' attention.

03:12.493 --> 03:16.695

Another plan? How do you
keep coming up with 'em?

03:50.130 --> 03:51.429
It's a gift!

03:51.431 --> 03:55.267
We wait until our ghosts
are reincarnated, then...

03:55.269 --> 03:58.003
I bet this is where
the time machine comes in!

03:58.005 --> 04:01.940
I hope you bet the farm
because you are exactly right!

04:01.942 --> 04:04.109
Once our ghosts
are reincarnated,

04:04.111 --> 04:09.180

someone have to rub
