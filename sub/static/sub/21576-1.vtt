01:37.995 --> 01:39.788
Come and play with us. Come and play.

01:42.583 --> 01:45.127
- Not gonna get me!
- You wish!

03:31.673 --> 03:34.468
- Jake.
- Mom, you okay?

03:36.178 --> 03:38.138
That was a big one.

03:40.682 --> 03:41.975
Bad dreams?

03:42.809 --> 03:44.186
No.

03:46.188 --> 03:47.940
Come on. Get breakfast.

04:00.118 --> 04:03.247
<i>This morning's quake is causing
major problems for commuters.</i>

04:03.413 --> 04:07.459
<i>The 5.7-magnitude quake hit
New York early this morning.</i>

04:07.626 --> 04:10.963
<i>Yet another in a series of quakes
that has rattled both coasts.</i>

04:11.129 --> 04:14.841
<i>Tokyo was hit again. And with
the Berlin quake last week...</i>

04:15.008 --> 04:18.053
<i>REPORTER 2: Question is: What is
causing all these earthquakes?</i>

04:19.096 --> 04:21.515
Christ, even ESPN's
doing the quakes now.

04:21.682 --> 04:24.351
<i>But we still don't know
what's causing them.</i>

04:24.518 --> 04:26.061
Hey. My folks sent me over to see...

04:26.228 --> 04:28.348
- ...if you guys are still alive.
- We're fine, Timmy.

04:28.372 --> 04:29.731
That was pretty intense.

04:29.898 --> 04:32.276
- Yeah.
- You good?

04:32.442 --> 04:34.653
- Yeah.
- We're just running a little late.

04:34.820 --> 04:36.947
- See you later?
- Say hi to your mom for me.

04:37.114 --> 04:38.991
Ma, Laurie says hi.

04:39.157 --> 04:41.243
Don't forget, you have Dr.
Hotchkiss after school.

04:48.875 --> 04:51.295
We're wasting money
on all those shrinks.

04:53.297 --> 04:54.464
He's making progress.

05:19.489 --> 05:21.033
Wait up!

05:24.995 --> 05:27.039
Hey, did you get the
books from my locker?

05:27.998 --> 05:29.499
So when's the apocalypse coming?

05:29.666 --> 05:31.877
Come on, man, just give me my book.

05:32.044 --> 05:35.172
- What's wrong, your meds stop working?
- Hey! Hey!

05:35.339 --> 05:37.090
- Give me my book!
- Get off me!

05:37.257 --> 05:38.967
Get off of me. TEACHER: Hey!

05:39.134 --> 05:41.219
Hey. That is enough, Chambers.

05:42.262 --> 05:44.139
I need my book.

05:45.265 --> 05:48.810
Hey. You need to go home and cool off.

05:53.857 --> 05:56.026
You've been, uh, quite busy, Jake.

06:00.238 --> 06:03.450
This big tower in the clouds
you keep dreaming about...

06:05.118 --> 06:08.955
...you say these earthquakes we've been
having have something to do with it.

06:09.122 --> 06:13.293
They happen because the
Tower is under attack.

06:17.798 --> 06:20.258
You're a smart kid, Jake.

06:20.425 --> 06:22.025
You know when you can't differentiate...

06:22.094 --> 06:24.596
- ...between dreams and reality-
- It's not a dream.

06:24.763 --> 06:25.889
Okay? I'm not crazy.

06:26.682 --> 06:28.517
I always see the same thing.

06:28.684 --> 06:32.437
The Tower, the Man in Black, the
creepy guys with the fake skins.

06:35.399 --> 06:38.193
What if the Tower were destroyed?

06:40.237 --> 06:42.072
Darkness and fire.

06:45.367 --> 06:47.160
Let's talk about your dad.

06:49.955 --> 06:51.456
Surprise.

06:52.541 --> 06:54.876
When you lost your father,
your world fell apart.

06:55.794 --> 06:58.171
You have these visions of
impending hell on Earth...

06:58.338 --> 07:01.508
...because that's how you feel inside.

07:02.050 --> 07:04.261
Even words like "darkness" and "fire"...

07:04.428 --> 07:08.140
...Jake, you're describing
the night your father died.

07:08.682 --> 07:10.684
Can't just be about that.

07:10.851 --> 07:12.352
They're just dreams, Jake.

07:13.437 --> 07:15.272
They're not real.

07:43.133 --> 07:44.217
Watch out.

07:44.968 --> 07:46.136
They'll take you.

07:46.303 --> 07:47.512
They steal kids like you.

07:47.679 --> 07:49.014
Cross them over.

07:51.266 --> 07:52.309
Special ones.

07:53.518 --> 07:56.772
The power of your mind,
that's what they want.

08:13.789 --> 08:16.458
Jake. What's up?

08:17.042 --> 08:18.543
Bad day?

08:18.710 --> 08:20.170
Yeah.

08:20.337 --> 08:21.922
Let's go.

08:22.088 --> 08:23.507
Want to hang out? JAKE: Yeah.

08:23.673 --> 08:26.051
...control, he's unstable.
We need to take the offer.

08:26.218 --> 08:29.054
- It's great treatment for no money.
- It's not about the money.

08:29.079 --> 08:31.079
<i>- I'll</i> wait in your room.
- There's nothing more...

08:31.103 --> 08:32.903
- ...we can do for him now.
- Jesus, Lon!

08:32.927 --> 08:35.424
Can you at least pretend
like he's your own kid?

08:38.145 --> 08:41.775
I'm sorry, baby, we... We
didn't hear you come in.

08:41.942 --> 08:43.902
What the hell happened in school today?

08:44.068 --> 08:46.488
You promised me you're
gonna stay out of trouble.

08:46.655 --> 08:48.406
Sorry, Mom.

08:49.991 --> 08:51.701
Honey, um...

08:51.868 --> 08:55.330
...the school's been approached
by a clinic upstate.

08:55.497 --> 08:57.332
They work with kids who...

08:57.499 --> 09:00.126
Who are having a hard time.

09:00.293 --> 09:02.003
There's an opening this weekend.

09:02.921 --> 09:04.548
It's supposed to be a great place.

09:04.714 --> 09:07.092
It's science-based: Brain
scans, sleep patterns.

09:07.259 --> 09:10.053
- I think it could...
- Yeah, okay.

09:14.099 --> 09:16.184
Man, psycho camp.

09:16.351 --> 09:17.519
Sucks, dude.

09:18.061 --> 09:21.022
More shrinks. Waste of time.

09:29.364 --> 09:30.407
Dude.

09:31.658 --> 09:32.909
What?

09:33.076 --> 09:34.536
Stop staring at your drawings.

09:34.703 --> 09:36.079
You're freaking me out.

09:37.789 --> 09:39.833
You think I'm crazy too, don't you?

09:40.542 --> 09:41.668
Batshit.

09:48.550 --> 09:49.801
...driving us apart.

09:52.888 --> 09:54.890
I'm just asking...

09:55.056 --> 09:57.058
We need help. We both need help.

09:57.225 --> 09:58.602
We are falling apart.

09:58.768 --> 10:00.270
I love him so much...

10:00.437 --> 10:04.107
...and I just can't stand
to see him like this.

10:04.274 --> 10:06.943
He was such a happy kid.

10:25.879 --> 10:27.756
No more dreams.

10:27.923 --> 10:30.258
Just one night of sleep.

10:49.486 --> 10:53.114
You have nothing to be
afraid of, my friend.

10:54.157 --> 10:56.743
Death is not far away.

10:57.452 --> 11:00.413
You want to know what's
on the other side?

11:00.997 --> 11:03.124
Can you see it?

11:04.834 --> 11:07.087
Of course you can't.

11:07.253 --> 11:09.422
Because nothing is there.

11:10.340 --> 11:13.218
- It's all a lie.
- Go to hell.

11:13.468 --> 11:16.012
Been there. Now burn.

11:27.399 --> 11:29.484
We lost.

11:30.318 --> 11:32.028
Not while the Tower still stands.

11:32.195 --> 11:33.738
Not while you still stand.

11:40.078 --> 11:41.871
Don't let him get into your head.

11:42.038 --> 11:43.832
Gunslingers.

11:45.542 --> 11:48.545
I do not aim with my hand.

11:48.712 --> 11:51.673
- He who aims with his hand...
- Has forgotten the face of his father.

11:51.800 --> 11:53.240
I aim with my eye.

11:53.264 --> 11:55.266
Gunslinger, over here.

11:56.469 --> 11:58.513
I do not shoot with my hand.

11:58.680 --> 12:01.599
He who shoots with his hand has
forgotten the face of his father.

12:01.766 --> 12:03.486
- I shoot with my mind.
- Gunslingers.

12:05.979 --> 12:07.739
I do not kill with my gun.

12:08.648 --> 12:11.443
He who kills with his gun has
forgotten the face of his father.

12:12.569 --> 12:13.737
I kill with my heart.

12:14.988 --> 12:16.072
Stop breathing.

12:17.782 --> 12:19.367
No.

12:23.663 --> 12:25.123
Breathe.

12:25.290 --> 12:27.167
Fight it. Fight it!

12:36.259 --> 12:39.054
It never works on you, does it, Roland?

12:39.804 --> 12:43.183
The power you have to
resist my magics...

12:45.393 --> 12:46.811
Not forever.

12:48.688 --> 12:50.440
Face me!

12:51.316 --> 12:52.942
Face me.

12:58.490 --> 13:01.076
The Tower will fall, Roland.

13:02.619 --> 13:05.246
Until next time, old friend.

13:09.459 --> 13:12.003
<i>The Man in Black fled
across the desert...</i>

13:12.170 --> 13:13.671
<i>...and the Gunslinger followed.</i>

13:20.261 --> 13:21.387
Holy shit.

13:22.847 --> 13:25.058
- Hey.
- This guy, he's some kind of soldier.

13:26.184 --> 13:27.727
He's called a Gunslinger.

13:27.894 --> 13:29.979
And this house, look, it's got a U.S.
mailbox.

13:30.146 --> 13:32.357
- I think it's in New York.
- Timmy, it's 7 a.m.

13:32.524 --> 13:33.858
Time to say goodbye.

13:34.025 --> 13:36.778
Sorry, got to go. Talk to you later.

13:54.879 --> 13:56.548
The people from the clinic are here.

13:57.340 --> 13:58.758
Now?

13:58.925 --> 14:00.635
I can't... I can't go now.

14:00.802 --> 14:02.303
You got to step up, Jake.

14:02.470 --> 14:05.098
If you won't do it for yourself,
then do it for your mom.

14:06.766 --> 14:09.366
It's in other boys? JILL: It's
common in adolescent boys.

14:09.978 --> 14:11.396
There he is.

14:11.563 --> 14:13.565
Hi there, Jake.

14:13.731 --> 14:15.024
I'm Jill.

14:15.191 --> 14:18.027
I'm your intake
administration supervisor.

14:18.778 --> 14:20.196
This is Toby, our driver.

14:20.363 --> 14:22.073
How's it going, young man?

14:22.240 --> 14:23.533
You pack your things?

14:23.700 --> 14:25.577
What exactly do they do at your clinic?

14:25.743 --> 14:28.913
Jake, these guys have been working
with the school for a long time.

14:29.080 --> 14:31.249
No, that's okay, Laurie.
We encourage questions.

14:31.416 --> 14:33.835
It shows spirit and vitality.

14:34.002 --> 14:35.962
He's just a healthy growing boy.

14:36.129 --> 14:38.673
I can assure you that all our
tests are done in a controlled...

14:38.840 --> 14:41.176
...child-friendly environment.

14:41.342 --> 14:43.428
We have experience
with cases like yours.

14:43.595 --> 14:46.723
Night terrors, hallucinations,
odd obsessions.

14:46.890 --> 14:50.059
Our approach is actually very gentle
compared to standard treatments.

14:50.226 --> 14:53.104
I understand your concerns, but
you don't have to worry at all.

14:55.148 --> 14:56.816
Mom, help me pack?

14:56.983 --> 14:58.651
Yeah.

14:59.986 --> 15:01.029
It's two days.

15:01.196 --> 15:04.866
Do you want your ripped
jeans or your regular ones?

15:05.491 --> 15:07.702
- What's wrong?
- Mom, it's them.

15:08.411 --> 15:11.289
- What?
- It's the skin people from my dream.

15:15.293 --> 15:18.963
- Honey, you need to stop this.
- No, you have to listen to me.

15:19.130 --> 15:20.381
What's going on?

15:21.507 --> 15:23.092
He's not human.

15:23.259 --> 15:24.979
- That's not his real face.
- For chrissake.

15:25.003 --> 15:26.070
Shut up, Lon.

15:26.342 --> 15:30.429
You actually hope I'm crazy, just
so you can get me out of here.

15:31.893 --> 15:36.189
Mom, you have to believe me.

15:37.357 --> 15:40.568
- Lon, maybe this-—
- Can't you see he's gotten worse?

15:41.236 --> 15:42.904
You're gonna go with them right now.

15:43.071 --> 15:46.574
Or, I swear to God, I will drag
you down the stairs myself.

15:57.752 --> 15:59.212
It's one weekend, kiddo.

16:00.171 --> 16:03.258
If you don't like it,
then I'll come get you.

16:03.925 --> 16:05.218
I promise.

16:14.686 --> 16:16.646
<i>Okay, I'll go.</i>

16:19.482 --> 16:22.360
- I love you, Mom.
- I love you too.

16:38.668 --> 16:41.421
I'm just gonna get my toothbrush.

16:49.137 --> 16:51.639
- He's just getting his things.
- He's trying to escape.

16:51.806 --> 16:53.433
Escape?

16:53.599 --> 16:55.101
Jake?

16:55.268 --> 16:56.519
Jake?

16:56.728 --> 16:59.605
Chrissake. Jake? Jake!

16:59.772 --> 17:00.857
Jake!

17:02.358 --> 17:04.527
- Jake!
- Get him.

17:08.448 --> 17:10.450
Come back here! JILL: Don't worry.

17:10.616 --> 17:12.868
Toby will get him down safely.

17:36.476 --> 17:38.394
Stop running.

18:32.073 --> 18:33.783
- Mom? You okay?
<i>- Where</i> are you?

18:33.950 --> 18:36.285
You can't just run away like that, Jake.

18:36.452 --> 18:38.496
<i>- Please come home.
- Sorry,</i> I <i>can't.</i>

18:38.663 --> 18:39.997
<i>Right now.</i>

18:40.957 --> 18:41.999
Jake <i>?</i>

18:42.708 --> 18:44.001
I'll call you later.

18:44.168 --> 18:46.045
<i>Love you, Mom.</i>

20:11.130 --> 20:12.650
Greetings, traveler.

20:12.798 --> 20:15.092
<i>Please enter destination.</i>

20:23.100 --> 20:24.352
One, nine.

20:24.519 --> 20:28.022
<i>One, nine, one, nine. Mid-World.</i>

20:50.670 --> 20:54.465
<i>Mid-World. One-way destination.</i>

21:39.844 --> 21:40.970
Let me go!

21:43.180 --> 21:44.265
Stop!

22:10.750 --> 22:12.335
What?

22:26.057 --> 22:27.558
Whoa.

22:40.029 --> 22:41.906
<i>Okay-</i>

22:42.073 --> 22:44.158
This is good.

22:45.868 --> 22:47.119
It's all real.

23:56.981 --> 23:58.983
New candidate. Female, age 11.

24:01.193 --> 24:02.528
Looks good.

24:02.695 --> 24:04.405
Arriving!

24:12.246 --> 24:13.998
Welcome back, sir.

24:16.542 --> 24:17.960
Find yourself a face, Rat Boy.

24:18.127 --> 24:19.962
You're in my house.

24:20.588 --> 24:22.047
How was your trip?

24:22.214 --> 24:23.883
Fine. Do we have any new leads?

24:26.010 --> 24:27.052
Got it.

24:27.219 --> 24:28.763
What have you got?

24:29.805 --> 24:31.515
These are all showing promise.

24:31.682 --> 24:33.809
Our trackers are going
out to them as we speak.

24:34.226 --> 24:35.866
There's been a serious breach of-

24:39.982 --> 24:41.776
I'm not fantastic at waiting.

24:44.278 --> 24:46.280
Unauthorized crossing, sir.

24:46.447 --> 24:48.699
One of the old portals
on Keystone Earth.

24:52.161 --> 24:53.329
Has that ever happened?

24:56.332 --> 24:58.709
Find me a portal close by.

25:04.006 --> 25:05.925
- Love your mask.
- Sir?

25:06.091 --> 25:09.053
Choose a pretty face and
the world is your oyster.

25:09.220 --> 25:10.638
Aligning, sir.

26:01.605 --> 26:03.023
Who are you?

26:03.941 --> 26:05.568
It's you.

26:08.821 --> 26:10.447
<i>I'm... I'm Jake.</i>

26:10.614 --> 26:12.908
Jake... Jake Chambers.

26:13.075 --> 26:15.494
I dreamt about you.

26:16.620 --> 26:17.663
Please.

26:20.666 --> 26:22.084
Here.

26:25.254 --> 26:26.797
Look.

26:29.508 --> 26:31.427
You're a Gunslinger, right?

26:39.143 --> 26:42.229
There are no Gunslingers. Not anymore.

26:47.151 --> 26:50.863
- But I saw you.
- Your dreams deceived you, boy.

26:51.030 --> 26:53.490
Told you what you want to hear.

26:55.200 --> 26:57.328
I came a long way to find you.

26:57.995 --> 26:59.538
From another world!

26:59.705 --> 27:01.582
Have a nice trip back.

27:06.003 --> 27:08.464
Hey. Wait!

27:09.465 --> 27:11.717
Dude, come on.

27:12.468 --> 27:14.303
Look, I saw you.

27:14.470 --> 27:17.556
There was a battlefield, and you were
fighting the Man in Black. And there...

27:18.766 --> 27:20.225
The Man in Black?

27:20.392 --> 27:21.852
- No, no, no.
- You know him?

27:22.019 --> 27:24.063
- Stop. Please, please, please.
- He sent you.

27:24.229 --> 27:25.397
You're one of his tricks.

27:25.564 --> 27:27.816
- No, no, no. I don't know!
- Where is he hiding?!

27:27.983 --> 27:30.194
- Where is he hiding?!
- I don't know, I swear!

27:30.361 --> 27:32.780
I just-— I just saw him in
my dreams, like I saw you!

27:33.197 --> 27:35.324
Your name is Roland, right?

27:37.660 --> 27:39.244
Please.

27:47.461 --> 27:48.879
When did you first see this?

27:49.880 --> 27:51.256
A year ago.

27:52.299 --> 27:54.969
- Who is he?
- He's a sorcerer.

27:59.723 --> 28:02.935
In all your visions, Walter is here?

28:03.644 --> 28:06.146
- Uh, yeah.
- In this place?

28:06.313 --> 28:07.606
Yeah.

28:09.858 --> 28:11.485
Wait, his name's Walter?

28:14.905 --> 28:17.908
Cool. Yeah, keep it.

28:28.377 --> 28:29.878
<i>I will</i> find you.

28:32.089 --> 28:35.759
There's a tribe beyond that forest.
We'll go there.

28:38.595 --> 28:40.973
They have seers who
will read your visions.

28:45.936 --> 28:47.312
Let's go. Keep Up-

28:49.106 --> 28:50.733
<i>Okay-</i>

28:58.824 --> 29:00.242
...I went down the slide.

29:00.868 --> 29:03.495
Then I got water up my
nose, and I went down...

29:03.662 --> 29:05.262
- ...and I couldn't see anything.
- Hate.

29:05.372 --> 29:06.874
Yeah.

29:08.876 --> 29:12.087
Sweetheart? What's wrong?

29:55.547 --> 29:58.300
Walter Padick. To what do
we owe this great honor?

29:58.467 --> 30:01.428
Someone used a portal
here, in your city...

30:01.595 --> 30:03.764
...without your knowledge.

30:04.348 --> 30:06.934
Killed the house demon.

30:07.893 --> 30:10.104
Forgive me, sire.

30:10.896 --> 30:13.232
We'll find out who this
trespasser is and where he went.

30:13.690 --> 30:15.609
Already on it.

30:16.151 --> 30:17.528
Now be a good dog.

30:28.622 --> 30:29.832
The blood is human.

30:30.916 --> 30:31.959
<i>BOY-</i>

30:34.378 --> 30:36.046
His Shine is pure.

30:38.882 --> 30:41.510
So that's how he got through.

30:41.885 --> 30:43.595
Sir?

30:44.054 --> 30:45.806
House demons are formidable beings...

30:45.973 --> 30:49.685
...but a truly powerful
psychic could override it.

30:50.227 --> 30:53.522
A boy with the Shine strong
enough to kill a demon?

30:54.189 --> 30:55.482
Jackpot.

30:55.649 --> 30:59.820
Sayre, didn't two skins have
trouble with a kid yesterday?

31:16.378 --> 31:17.546
Don't eat that.

31:18.130 --> 31:20.757
Don't want to have to carry
you for the rest of the way.

31:54.458 --> 31:56.043
Roland?

32:15.437 --> 32:16.480
What are they?

32:16.647 --> 32:18.023
Taheen.

32:18.732 --> 32:19.900
They belong to Walter.

32:20.067 --> 32:22.110
Don't run off in the woods.
It's not safe.

32:23.153 --> 32:24.696
But you were the one who ran off.

32:25.280 --> 32:26.573
You said you were hungry.

32:30.911 --> 32:32.287
What?

32:39.294 --> 32:41.338
You had theme parks here.

32:46.009 --> 32:49.263
These ancient structures are
from before the world moved on.

32:49.429 --> 32:51.723
No one knows what they are.

32:52.182 --> 32:53.684
They're theme parks.

32:57.896 --> 32:58.939
I saw you fight him.

33:02.276 --> 33:03.796
There was a field covered with bodies.

33:11.493 --> 33:13.745
That was our final stand.

33:17.457 --> 33:19.626
I lost my father that day.

33:22.379 --> 33:23.463
You saw that?

33:31.430 --> 33:33.307
Was it about the Tower?

33:35.267 --> 33:37.102
The war?

33:38.520 --> 33:40.230
Yes.

33:42.441 --> 33:44.359
Now, eat your rabbit.

33:51.533 --> 33:53.452
It's an honor to meet
you in person, sir.

33:53.618 --> 33:54.745
What brings you here?

33:54.911 --> 33:56.079
How may we serve him?

33:56.246 --> 33:58.290
Well, I hear you lost a kid.

34:00.125 --> 34:01.918
It... It wasn't our fault.

34:02.085 --> 34:05.547
It was as if the child knew what we
were. We're doing everything we can...

34:05.714 --> 34:08.759
- Name and location.
- It's all in here.

34:14.389 --> 34:16.933
"Jake Chambers."

34:19.643 --> 34:21.730
Now kill...

34:21.897 --> 34:23.106
...each other.

34:26.068 --> 34:28.612
Calm down. Enjoy the show, folks.

34:29.196 --> 34:31.947
You ain't seen nothing yet.

34:42.042 --> 34:43.502
You draw with a good hand.

34:49.466 --> 34:50.717
I don't know what this is.

34:54.971 --> 34:56.014
It's a map.

34:58.392 --> 35:01.853
My father showed me a...
A map like this once.

35:06.108 --> 35:10.654
Inside the circle is your
world and my world...

35:11.446 --> 35:12.697
...many others.

35:12.864 --> 35:14.699
No one knows how many.

35:15.283 --> 35:19.788
The Dark Tower stands at
the center of all things.

35:21.957 --> 35:24.918
And it's stood there from
the beginning of time.

35:25.585 --> 35:28.547
And it sends out powerful energy...

35:28.713 --> 35:31.049
...that protects the universe...

35:31.216 --> 35:33.718
...shields us from what's outside.

35:33.885 --> 35:35.470
What do you mean, "outside"?

35:36.596 --> 35:37.889
What's outside the universe?

35:42.436 --> 35:45.021
Outside is endless darkness...

35:45.188 --> 35:49.192
...full of demons trying to get to us.

35:49.776 --> 35:53.655
Walter wants to tear down
the Tower and let them in.

35:54.948 --> 35:57.117
When the Tower falls, he'll rule...

35:57.284 --> 35:59.828
...in a world full of monsters.

36:00.871 --> 36:02.831
But you're trying to
stop him, aren't you?

36:03.790 --> 36:05.917
To protect the Tower.

36:06.918 --> 36:08.462
I've seen them try to destroy it.

36:08.628 --> 36:11.673
- If we could just get there...
- There is no "we," Jake.

36:11.840 --> 36:14.259
All that matters to me is that I find...

36:14.426 --> 36:16.928
...and kill Walter.

36:17.596 --> 36:19.306
That's it.

37:01.848 --> 37:03.683
Beamquake.

37:04.142 --> 37:05.185
Strong.

37:06.686 --> 37:08.063
Sounds like screams.

37:17.572 --> 37:19.658
They're just like the
quakes we get back home.

37:20.408 --> 37:23.578
Yeah, what happens in one world...

37:23.745 --> 37:25.497
...echoes in others.

37:26.665 --> 37:29.000
Hope my mom's okay.

37:32.462 --> 37:34.673
Try to get some sleep.

37:37.676 --> 37:39.803
That's not happening.

37:47.143 --> 37:48.979
Jake.

37:51.856 --> 37:54.192
Jake.

38:06.079 --> 38:07.247
<i>Hey, kiddo.</i>

38:10.333 --> 38:12.377
<i>Where are you?</i>

38:26.558 --> 38:29.185
Everyone who walks with you dies.

38:39.863 --> 38:40.905
Jake.

38:56.630 --> 38:57.714
Hey, kiddo.

38:59.716 --> 39:01.509
Dad?

39:02.469 --> 39:04.596
Long time.

39:06.973 --> 39:09.934
It's good to see you, man. You got tall.

39:10.560 --> 39:12.604
This isn't real.

39:13.730 --> 39:15.565
- You're...
- Dead?

39:15.732 --> 39:17.692
Not here.

39:19.569 --> 39:21.029
I missed you.

39:21.196 --> 39:23.073
I missed you too, kiddo.

39:23.907 --> 39:25.116
Come on.

39:25.283 --> 39:26.493
It's okay.

39:29.954 --> 39:31.998
Let's go home.

39:37.962 --> 39:39.172
No.

39:43.635 --> 39:45.512
Darkness and fire.

39:50.517 --> 39:51.976
Jake!

39:52.352 --> 39:53.937
Get away from it!

40:12.288 --> 40:14.958
Roland. My son.

40:17.001 --> 40:18.044
Come with me.

40:26.219 --> 40:27.220
It's okay.

40:27.387 --> 40:29.222
It's gone.

40:31.516 --> 40:33.059
My dad was in there.

40:34.018 --> 40:36.354
No, they sense your weakness...

40:36.521 --> 40:39.065
...create illusions to distract you.

40:40.108 --> 40:42.485
That wasn't anybody you know.

40:43.695 --> 40:45.280
I'm sorry.

40:50.368 --> 40:52.662
That was just a small tear.

40:52.829 --> 40:55.832
They happen after every
attack on the Tower.

40:55.999 --> 40:59.836
Those things, they're what's coming
if the Tower falls, aren't they?

41:00.003 --> 41:01.045
Yes.

41:01.212 --> 41:03.923
But if we find that place where
they're keeping the kids, we could-

41:04.132 --> 41:06.050
- Shh, shh, shh.
- What?

41:06.217 --> 41:07.886
Something got out.

41:16.728 --> 41:18.563
Run! Jake, run!

42:44.107 --> 42:46.067
You're gonna need help.

42:46.234 --> 42:47.777
I've hurt worse.

42:48.403 --> 42:50.154
But you're bleeding.

42:50.321 --> 42:52.782
I heal fast.

42:55.118 --> 42:57.328
You handled yourself well.

42:57.495 --> 43:00.123
That was brave, going for the gun.

43:03.585 --> 43:05.044
They're gonna find him, Laurie.

43:05.420 --> 43:08.590
We filled out every form.
They have his picture.

43:20.768 --> 43:23.062
I hope you don't mind me
making myself at home.

43:23.229 --> 43:25.273
Where I come from, we
don't have chicken.

43:25.440 --> 43:27.984
- Who the hell are you?
- Oh, you know me, Lon.

43:28.151 --> 43:29.903
You're the one that called me here.

43:30.069 --> 43:31.112
Not by the telephone...

43:31.279 --> 43:34.324
...but with your every desire
to get rid of the brat...

43:34.490 --> 43:37.201
...all in the hopes that Mommy
there might love you best.

43:38.995 --> 43:41.414
But you'll always be a seat-filler, Lon.

43:42.040 --> 43:43.958
- You get out of here right now.
- Lon.

43:45.793 --> 43:47.712
It's the man from Jake's drawings.

43:50.924 --> 43:52.550
Drawings?

43:55.511 --> 43:56.721
Stop breathing.

43:57.931 --> 43:59.515
- Aah!
- Quiet.

44:02.685 --> 44:04.062
Drawings.

44:13.154 --> 44:14.364
Show me.

44:44.560 --> 44:48.982
Well, it looks like I've
got myself a stalker.

45:05.498 --> 45:07.375
Gunslinger.

45:22.056 --> 45:25.184
This son of yours is
quite special, isn't he?

45:37.405 --> 45:40.908
The guilt you must feel...

45:42.410 --> 45:44.662
...not believing in him.

45:46.122 --> 45:49.584
And you sent your only
child off to the asylum.

45:52.962 --> 45:55.089
Shame...

45:56.090 --> 45:58.092
...on you.

46:58.486 --> 46:59.654
Stranger approaching!

47:03.699 --> 47:05.326
Gather round!

47:09.789 --> 47:12.166
Long days, pleasant nights.

47:12.333 --> 47:14.293
May you have twice that number.

47:14.877 --> 47:18.381
I haven't seen one of your
kind since I was a young man.

47:18.840 --> 47:20.341
Seeing you here, alive-

47:20.508 --> 47:22.426
Who's your strongest seer?

47:23.010 --> 47:24.137
That would be me.

47:25.346 --> 47:26.681
I'm Arra.

47:27.682 --> 47:30.184
The boy here has visions of this place.

47:31.727 --> 47:33.938
I need to know where it is.

47:37.483 --> 47:39.902
The Man in Black.

47:40.069 --> 47:42.238
We managed to do some
serious damage, sir...

47:42.386 --> 47:44.466
...but it didn't fall. WALTER:
None of that matters.

47:44.490 --> 47:47.243
I found the one. This kid's going
to bring down the Tower...

47:47.451 --> 47:49.829
...all by his lonesome.

47:50.288 --> 47:52.456
- Where is this child?
- He's here...

47:52.623 --> 47:54.250
...on Mid-World...

47:54.417 --> 47:58.087
...looking for an old friend
of mine, Roland of Eld.

47:59.046 --> 48:01.340
Wait, I thought all the
Gunslingers were dead.

48:02.091 --> 48:04.091
Roland's always had an
annoying ability...

48:04.177 --> 48:06.179
...to resist my magics.

48:06.345 --> 48:08.431
So I killed everyone
he ever cared about.

48:09.348 --> 48:12.059
Last I heard, he was roaming
the Mohaine aimlessly.

48:12.226 --> 48:14.786
- That's where the boy is going.
- Mohaine Desert? Isn't that...?

48:14.810 --> 48:17.148
Vast. Yes. And so is this boy's Shine.

48:17.315 --> 48:20.234
I'll send our trackers
in the region, sir.

48:31.787 --> 48:33.206
This will get worse.

48:33.372 --> 48:36.209
I don't have anything
that can help with that.

48:36.375 --> 48:38.002
You need to rest, let it heal.

48:38.669 --> 48:40.379
<i>I'll</i> be fine.

48:43.049 --> 48:44.175
Thankee, Sai.

48:44.342 --> 48:46.582
You've come all the way from
Keystone Earth to find him.

48:49.180 --> 48:51.891
His Shine is beyond
anything I've ever seen.

48:53.601 --> 48:54.727
Shine?

48:54.894 --> 48:56.062
Psychic powers.

48:56.854 --> 48:59.023
Very few are born with this gift.

48:59.190 --> 49:03.236
Often, the power is so slight,
people don't even know they have it.

49:04.028 --> 49:07.615
<i>Your Shine burns so brightly, Jake.</i>

49:07.782 --> 49:11.702
<i>You have potential I can't
even begin to understand.</i>

49:11.869 --> 49:13.037
Whoa.

49:15.539 --> 49:17.375
Her voice was in my head.

49:17.541 --> 49:20.294
Your gift is extraordinary, Jake.

49:20.461 --> 49:23.673
It made you see across worlds.

49:25.258 --> 49:26.717
The drawing.

49:26.884 --> 49:28.302
What about the drawing?

49:31.639 --> 49:33.808
Concentrate.

49:33.975 --> 49:36.727
Share your visions with me.

49:43.859 --> 49:45.486
Open up.

49:47.488 --> 49:49.365
<i>Show me.</i>

49:55.579 --> 49:57.039
<i>The Man in Black...</i>

49:57.206 --> 49:58.416
Jake.

49:59.208 --> 50:00.501
<i>Fled across the desert.</i>

50:03.879 --> 50:05.798
Tell me.

50:06.132 --> 50:07.633
Where is he?

50:09.176 --> 50:10.553
Northern Wastelands.

50:15.182 --> 50:17.601
That's more than six months of travel.

50:19.562 --> 50:21.522
But you can get me there
faster than that.

50:21.689 --> 50:24.525
The Man in Black and his men
keep track of all portal travel.

50:24.692 --> 50:27.528
- I need to get there.
- Portals.

50:27.695 --> 50:29.947
We couldn't help you,
even if we wanted to.

50:30.114 --> 50:33.784
The only way to access their territories
is from one of their own bases.

50:36.162 --> 50:38.289
Then I'll make it on foot.

50:38.956 --> 50:40.166
Wait.

50:41.792 --> 50:43.961
The fake-skins...

50:44.712 --> 50:47.006
...they take kids from
different worlds, right?

50:47.173 --> 50:48.716
They tried to take me from New York.

50:48.883 --> 50:51.969
- Doesn't that mean that they-?
- They have a base there.

50:52.595 --> 50:55.848
With a portal that can take
me right to this place.

50:58.559 --> 51:01.020
You're gonna send us to Keystone Earth.

51:11.280 --> 51:13.407
We're diverting power to the generators.

51:13.574 --> 51:15.618
The portal will be ready shortly.

51:18.704 --> 51:20.664
Do they have guns in your world?

51:21.916 --> 51:22.958
Yeah.

51:24.085 --> 51:26.921
And bullets, are they as
rare as they are here?

51:28.089 --> 51:30.132
You're gonna like Earth. A lot.

51:36.639 --> 51:40.518
We agreed we'd never use the portal
unless the village was in danger.

51:40.684 --> 51:42.478
They will find out we have it and come.

51:42.645 --> 51:45.815
We can't disobey a Gunslinger.
It's the law.

51:45.981 --> 51:48.609
- How do you know what he is?
- Arra.

51:48.776 --> 51:49.985
You must have read him.

51:50.611 --> 51:52.655
What do you see?

51:55.991 --> 51:58.452
He's Roland of Gilead.

51:58.619 --> 52:00.121
Last of the line of Eld.

52:05.668 --> 52:09.046
But the Man in Black has
his soul in his pocket...

52:09.588 --> 52:13.300
...and his heart's
consumed by vengeance.

52:14.135 --> 52:15.719
He's not a Gunslinger.

52:16.762 --> 52:18.681
Not anymore.

52:20.391 --> 52:21.934
Or would you tell us differently?

52:23.894 --> 52:25.980
Only a goat would lie to a seer.

52:26.147 --> 52:28.232
You dishonor your ancestors.

52:28.399 --> 52:30.693
The Gunslingers have sworn an
oath to defend the Tower...

52:30.860 --> 52:32.528
Look around you.

52:33.821 --> 52:35.239
The war is over, and we lost.

52:38.325 --> 52:42.246
If you left your little haven,
you would see that for yourself.

52:42.997 --> 52:45.708
The darkness is everywhere...

52:45.875 --> 52:48.085
...and trying to fight against
it accomplishes nothing.

52:50.087 --> 52:53.257
I was fighting to defend the Tower
before most of you were even born.

52:54.175 --> 52:55.676
There's always a battle.

52:55.843 --> 52:57.386
Always.

52:57.845 --> 52:59.054
But no more.

53:00.473 --> 53:02.433
Isn't that why we're losing?

53:02.600 --> 53:05.352
Because everyone stopped believing.

53:05.519 --> 53:10.483
As long as the darkness is out
there, the Tower will fall.

53:11.150 --> 53:14.236
And before that happens,
I will get my revenge.

53:32.796 --> 53:33.881
Look.

53:34.798 --> 53:36.008
He saved my life.

53:38.010 --> 53:40.095
And he doesn't even like me that much.

53:43.057 --> 53:44.683
He's still a Gunslinger.

53:45.726 --> 53:47.728
I know he is.

53:51.273 --> 53:53.484
Should be ready anytime now.

53:53.651 --> 53:55.319
As soon as it aligns, it should open...

53:55.486 --> 53:57.696
...in an unobstructed
area in your city...

53:57.863 --> 53:59.823
...on your version of Earth.

53:59.990 --> 54:01.283
"Should"?

54:01.450 --> 54:02.910
Technology's very old.

54:03.077 --> 54:05.663
Remember that number.
It's your way back here.

54:06.121 --> 54:07.248
Got it.

54:07.414 --> 54:08.958
Been there.

54:14.672 --> 54:15.714
Hey.

54:16.549 --> 54:18.425
You Okay?

54:24.014 --> 54:25.432
What's wrong?

54:54.211 --> 54:56.297
We're losing power.

55:00.175 --> 55:02.219
Sir, they're in the village.

55:16.108 --> 55:18.736
Oh, no. Faras.

55:18.902 --> 55:21.322
- Can you fix it?
- We have spare parts in the village.

55:24.867 --> 55:28.120
Jake, go find somewhere
close to hide, understand?

55:28.621 --> 55:29.663
Yeah.

55:46.263 --> 55:47.348
Come on!

55:47.514 --> 55:48.849
Get inside!

55:49.016 --> 55:51.602
- We need to go! Hurry!
- Are you okay?

55:54.021 --> 55:55.272
Go get weapons!

55:56.649 --> 55:58.233
Which way?

55:58.400 --> 56:00.235
In there.

56:01.320 --> 56:02.613
He's there.

56:04.239 --> 56:05.574
He's hurt.

56:05.741 --> 56:08.160
My child! Please!

56:09.953 --> 56:12.122
His guns are forged from the steel...

56:12.289 --> 56:14.667
<i>...of the sword of Arthur Eld himself.</i>

56:17.294 --> 56:19.630
I believe Keystoners call it Excalibur.

56:27.596 --> 56:30.307
Please, just go!

56:32.810 --> 56:35.354
Just get help, please!

56:41.443 --> 56:43.843
- We have to get out of here.
- No, I've got to get them out!

56:43.867 --> 56:45.869
No, no, please, we have to go!

56:46.323 --> 56:48.409
- Ahh!
- Run.

56:50.911 --> 56:53.122
Let's go! WOMAN: Help!

56:53.288 --> 56:54.748
Go get the parts.

56:54.915 --> 56:56.041
Dad!

57:05.884 --> 57:07.124
They were after our boy.

57:07.219 --> 57:08.637
Why would they want our boy?

57:44.715 --> 57:45.758
Right.

57:47.301 --> 57:49.219
- Turn on the water pumps.
- Right away, sir.

57:49.386 --> 57:51.146
No! MAN 1: Let's try to get them out!

57:52.473 --> 57:55.184
- Okay, <i>I'll</i> take care of you!
- All right.

57:55.350 --> 57:57.978
There you are. All right?

57:58.145 --> 57:59.730
Come this way.

58:14.787 --> 58:17.498
You couldn't save him, Roland.

58:23.462 --> 58:24.713
Sir, Shine.

58:24.880 --> 58:26.590
That's the boy. Get him.

58:32.596 --> 58:34.014
Jake.

58:44.399 --> 58:45.609
Jake.

58:45.776 --> 58:48.445
- They're here for him.
- I know.

58:52.991 --> 58:54.535
Roland.

58:55.369 --> 58:57.996
- What are you doing?
- Quiet.

59:26.608 --> 59:30.153
Roland. Please. Help me, please.

01:00:10.777 --> 01:00:11.945
Let's go! Let's go!

01:00:12.112 --> 01:00:13.614
We need to leave.

01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:14.990
He's not safe here.

01:00:15.157 --> 01:00:17.826
And as long as he's here,
you aren't either.

01:00:17.993 --> 01:00:19.077
We have this fight.

01:00:20.203 --> 01:00:22.539
- Come on.
- Go.

01:00:23.498 --> 01:00:24.541
Jake.

01:00:24.708 --> 01:00:27.002
Be careful using the Shine.
They're tracking you.

01:00:29.671 --> 01:00:31.431
<i>Portal alignment complete.</i>

01:00:31.548 --> 01:00:32.799
Come on.

01:00:37.679 --> 01:00:39.514
No, it's not ready yet.

01:00:50.859 --> 01:00:52.486
- Knife.
- He's a chef.

01:00:53.070 --> 01:00:54.696
Come on.

01:01:05.332 --> 01:01:07.751
So many people.

01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:18.637
We need to get you help. Right now.

01:01:25.894 --> 01:01:27.396
They had a portal.

01:01:28.689 --> 01:01:30.273
I think they're gone.

01:01:46.832 --> 01:01:48.709
Get me the coordinates.

01:01:52.587 --> 01:01:56.466
One last time around
the wheel, old friend.

01:02:00.971 --> 01:02:02.597
This is madness.

01:02:02.764 --> 01:02:05.267
You can't walk into a
hospital here carrying guns.

01:02:05.434 --> 01:02:07.602
Trust me. Come on.

01:02:10.564 --> 01:02:12.774
Let me do all the talking.

01:02:15.989 --> 01:02:18.214
<i>Hi. You've reached Laurie, Lon and Jake.</i>

01:02:18.238 --> 01:02:19.598
<i>Please leave a detailed message...</i>

01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:22.409
<i>...and we'll get back to
you as soon as possible.</i>

01:02:22.576 --> 01:02:24.369
This is awful. Try it.

01:02:24.536 --> 01:02:27.176
<i>- That looks gross. What is it?
- You got to try it. It's terrible.</i>

01:02:27.247 --> 01:02:28.987
<i>I don't want to try it if it's terrible.</i>

01:02:29.012 --> 01:02:30.107
<i>It's like mango...</i>

01:02:30.250 --> 01:02:32.961
Do the animals here still speak?

01:02:33.128 --> 01:02:36.173
What? No, that's a commercial.

01:02:40.052 --> 01:02:41.887
Wait, what do you mean by "still"?

01:02:42.054 --> 01:02:43.805
He's in here.

01:02:43.972 --> 01:02:45.223
Mr. Deschain.

01:02:46.224 --> 01:02:48.143
I see the antibiotics are kicking in.

01:02:48.310 --> 01:02:51.229
On a scale of one to 10,
how bad is your pain?

01:02:53.148 --> 01:02:54.566
<i>Okay-</i>

01:02:54.733 --> 01:02:57.110
You were in very bad shape.

01:02:57.277 --> 01:02:59.071
I'm surprised you're even sitting up.

01:02:59.237 --> 01:03:00.697
I'm stronger than most.

01:03:02.699 --> 01:03:04.201
We get that sentiment a lot.

01:03:04.367 --> 01:03:07.287
So aside from your infection
and the wound from the...

01:03:07.454 --> 01:03:09.456
...costume-party incident...

01:03:09.623 --> 01:03:13.960
...we also found traces of
hepatitis A, B, E, and...

01:03:16.046 --> 01:03:18.173
...chronic radiation sickness.

01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:22.844
Have you traveled overseas in
the past couple of months?

01:03:28.141 --> 01:03:31.645
No. I've been here on Keystone Earth.

01:03:35.273 --> 01:03:36.650
So am I cured or not?

01:03:36.777 --> 01:03:39.497
We're going to keep you here for the
night to monitor your progress.

01:03:39.521 --> 01:03:41.488
Maybe tomorrow afternoon-What
are you doing? No.

01:03:41.655 --> 01:03:43.466
- I can't stay here.
- You need to get back on that.

01:03:43.490 --> 01:03:45.325
- Mr. Deschain, you need-
- For your services.

01:03:45.492 --> 01:03:47.327
- Wait, what?
- May your days be long.

01:03:47.494 --> 01:03:49.079
But you need to get back on that.

01:03:49.246 --> 01:03:50.789
- Mr. Deschain?
- Bring my guns.

01:03:52.582 --> 01:03:54.459
These are painkillers and vitamins.

01:03:56.711 --> 01:03:59.548
You only want to take one or two at a...

01:04:00.590 --> 01:04:03.051
...time. WOMAN: Hey, cutie.

01:04:03.218 --> 01:04:04.553
Can we join the party?

01:04:06.263 --> 01:04:09.182
You have both forgotten the
faces of your fathers.

01:04:11.309 --> 01:04:13.311
You probably shouldn't
talk to people here.

01:04:23.572 --> 01:04:25.240
What is this?

01:04:25.907 --> 01:04:26.950
<i>Sugar.</i>

01:04:28.743 --> 01:04:31.913
How we gonna find the portal?
New York's a pretty big place.

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:33.290
I don't know.

01:04:33.456 --> 01:04:37.002
I just can't let Walter know
how I'm coming for him.

01:04:45.635 --> 01:04:47.470
I've got an idea.

01:04:50.473 --> 01:04:53.727
These painkillers work fast.

01:04:53.894 --> 01:04:55.854
I haven't felt this good in years.

01:04:56.021 --> 01:04:57.772
Yeah, we got the good stuff.

01:04:58.148 --> 01:05:00.901
Got any more of that sugar?

01:05:02.235 --> 01:05:04.070
There's nothing to be scared of.

01:05:04.446 --> 01:05:06.865
I promise you, whatever happens...

01:05:07.032 --> 01:05:09.034
...you'll be at peace.

01:05:09.201 --> 01:05:12.204
- You'll be...
- A seer who lies.

01:05:14.372 --> 01:05:15.457
The worst kind.

01:05:17.626 --> 01:05:19.836
I like you already.

01:05:21.129 --> 01:05:22.714
Come now.

01:05:24.382 --> 01:05:25.550
Good bye.

01:05:27.636 --> 01:05:29.012
Talk.

01:05:31.056 --> 01:05:32.599
Shh.

01:05:33.225 --> 01:05:36.853
Don't fight it. Where
did he take the boy?

01:05:38.563 --> 01:05:39.606
Jake?

01:05:39.773 --> 01:05:41.816
Chambers, yes. Where?

01:05:46.821 --> 01:05:50.492
- Key... Key...
- Keystone Earth.

01:05:50.659 --> 01:05:51.701
Thank you.

01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:03.838
Hey, remember me?

01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:09.261
You said they were crossing over kids.

01:06:10.971 --> 01:06:12.555
You were one of them, weren't you?

01:06:13.390 --> 01:06:16.268
I lost it. The Shine.

01:06:17.394 --> 01:06:18.834
Which way did they take you through?

01:06:18.858 --> 01:06:21.690
- No, no, you have to run.
- Do you remember? A portal, a door.

01:06:21.856 --> 01:06:23.733
- Anything, please.
- It's almost over.

01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:25.110
It's almost over.

01:06:25.277 --> 01:06:27.070
It's almost over. It's almost over.

01:06:27.237 --> 01:06:29.698
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

01:06:29.864 --> 01:06:31.658
<i>Remember. Show me.</i>

01:06:35.328 --> 01:06:36.371
<i>Dixie.</i>

01:06:36.538 --> 01:06:37.789
Jake!

01:06:38.957 --> 01:06:40.667
Jake!

01:06:41.835 --> 01:06:43.962
They can track the Shine.

01:06:44.129 --> 01:06:45.672
Okay?

01:06:48.717 --> 01:06:51.094
I know what you are.

01:06:52.429 --> 01:06:54.389
Gunslinger.

01:06:55.473 --> 01:06:57.142
Go.

01:07:02.188 --> 01:07:05.358
Should have enough to find it. Got
to get home and do some research.

01:07:05.525 --> 01:07:06.698
Your home?

01:07:06.778 --> 01:07:08.969
Yeah, I got to let my mom know I'm okay.

01:07:09.654 --> 01:07:11.694
<i>We have trackers spread
throughout the city.</i>

01:07:11.823 --> 01:07:13.366
There's no trace of him yet, sir.

01:07:13.533 --> 01:07:15.660
Couple of small spikes, but
not enough to hone in on.

01:07:15.827 --> 01:07:17.037
Don't you worry, Dicky-boy.

01:07:17.203 --> 01:07:18.913
- I've got you covered.
- Sir?

01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:22.250
I left a surprise for our little friend.
Just be ready.

01:07:22.417 --> 01:07:25.170
- You should probably wait here.
- Dude.

01:07:25.337 --> 01:07:27.422
- Where the hell have you been?
- Timmy. Um...

01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:28.715
Who's that?

01:07:30.216 --> 01:07:31.509
I'll tell you later.

01:07:31.676 --> 01:07:34.095
How's Mom and Lon? They
must be freaking out.

01:07:34.387 --> 01:07:36.181
They haven't been home since yesterday.

01:07:39.142 --> 01:07:40.685
Mom.Mom.

01:07:51.363 --> 01:07:52.405
- Mom?
- Jake.

01:07:52.572 --> 01:07:53.865
- Mom? Mom! Mom!
- Jake!

01:07:57.619 --> 01:07:59.079
No.

01:07:59.537 --> 01:08:00.580
No, no.

01:08:00.747 --> 01:08:04.542
No, no. No, no, no.

01:08:05.585 --> 01:08:06.920
No, no, no.

01:08:07.587 --> 01:08:09.422
No, Mom. No, no, no.

01:08:10.924 --> 01:08:12.258
No, no, Mom.

01:08:20.892 --> 01:08:22.310
No.

01:08:23.353 --> 01:08:24.938
No, no, Mom.

01:08:25.104 --> 01:08:26.398
- Drawings.
- Mom.

01:08:26.564 --> 01:08:27.732
<i>I'll</i> make it quick.

01:08:28.608 --> 01:08:29.651
Jake!

01:08:32.987 --> 01:08:34.322
No.

01:08:34.488 --> 01:08:35.782
No, Jake.

01:08:36.157 --> 01:08:38.033
- Don't see it.
- Mom.

01:08:38.201 --> 01:08:40.412
It's what he wants.

01:08:41.203 --> 01:08:44.124
- He's tracking you.
- She's dead.

01:08:44.290 --> 01:08:45.417
Close your mind.

01:08:46.251 --> 01:08:49.045
Close your mind. Let the
pain run through you, Jake.

01:08:50.171 --> 01:08:51.214
He killed her.

01:08:51.965 --> 01:08:54.050
- I know. I know.
- He killed her.

01:08:58.388 --> 01:08:59.889
Come here.

01:09:30.462 --> 01:09:32.671
I will kill him.

01:09:34.256 --> 01:09:35.508
For both of us.

01:09:43.308 --> 01:09:45.435
What about the Tower?

01:09:50.857 --> 01:09:54.569
My mom died so you could
have your revenge?

01:09:58.823 --> 01:10:01.493
Maybe your world is almost
gone, but mine isn't.

01:10:01.659 --> 01:10:04.454
You said it yourself, as long
as the darkness is out there...

01:10:04.621 --> 01:10:07.123
...the Tower's always in danger.

01:10:10.877 --> 01:10:12.921
You know, they were right.

01:10:15.882 --> 01:10:18.051
You're not a Gunslinger.

01:10:22.805 --> 01:10:23.848
Here.

01:10:24.015 --> 01:10:26.267
It's called the Dixie Pig.

01:10:26.559 --> 01:10:28.061
It's on Plymouth and Pearl.

01:10:43.993 --> 01:10:46.079
When I was younger...

01:10:47.914 --> 01:10:50.667
...I would recite the
Gunslinger's Creed.

01:10:53.336 --> 01:10:55.797
It calms the heart and the mind.

01:10:57.507 --> 01:10:59.968
I haven't spoken it for years.

01:11:23.283 --> 01:11:25.827
I do not aim with my hand.

01:11:25.994 --> 01:11:30.039
He who aims with his hand has
forgotten the face of his father.

01:11:31.541 --> 01:11:33.042
I aim with my eye.

01:11:36.212 --> 01:11:38.798
I do not shoot with my hand.

01:11:38.965 --> 01:11:42.927
He who shoots with his hand has
forgotten the face of his father.

01:11:43.094 --> 01:11:45.096
I shoot with my mind.

01:11:58.067 --> 01:12:00.028
I do not kill with my gun.

01:12:00.194 --> 01:12:01.840
BOTH He who kills with his gun

01:12:01.865 --> 01:12:03.722
has forgotten the face of his father.

01:12:04.157 --> 01:12:06.117
Not while the Tower still stands.

01:12:06.284 --> 01:12:07.493
Not while you still stand.

01:12:07.660 --> 01:12:09.787
- I kill with my heart.
- I kill with my heart.

01:12:19.922 --> 01:12:21.758
That's good.

01:12:22.592 --> 01:12:24.385
Your Shine is your weapon, Jake.

01:12:26.929 --> 01:12:28.931
Guns are mine.

01:12:45.406 --> 01:12:47.575
Can I help you fellas?

01:12:48.451 --> 01:12:50.578
- Hey.
- Forty-five-caliber bullets.

01:12:50.787 --> 01:12:51.829
Uh...

01:12:52.038 --> 01:12:54.290
- I only have...
- We'll take them all.

01:12:54.457 --> 01:12:56.334
Just do what he says. He won't hurt you.

01:12:56.501 --> 01:12:57.752
I don't want any trouble.

01:12:58.419 --> 01:13:00.088
Well, then you're smarter than most.

01:13:00.463 --> 01:13:01.756
Hurry Up-

01:13:13.184 --> 01:13:15.144
All right, let's get you somewhere safe.

01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:17.647
Gunslinger.

01:13:20.566 --> 01:13:22.193
Did you miss me?

01:13:26.114 --> 01:13:27.532
Well, I guess you did.

01:13:27.699 --> 01:13:29.492
Roland! Roland, Roland.

01:13:29.659 --> 01:13:30.910
Jake, run.

01:13:31.494 --> 01:13:32.537
Run!

01:13:42.088 --> 01:13:45.925
I see you finally found a compass,
yet you still came to me.

01:13:46.801 --> 01:13:48.845
Because I'm your only
destination, Roland.

01:13:51.013 --> 01:13:52.348
Fire away.

01:13:54.350 --> 01:13:56.269
It's not me. I'm not doing this.

01:13:59.605 --> 01:14:01.482
First, you want to save the Tower.

01:14:02.942 --> 01:14:04.652
Then, kill the Man in Black.

01:14:09.031 --> 01:14:12.201
You are like a dog fetching
a stick over and over.

01:14:12.368 --> 01:14:14.871
You tell the kid what
happened to the old crew?

01:14:15.037 --> 01:14:18.541
You tell him that everyone that
walks with you dies by my hand?

01:14:18.708 --> 01:14:19.959
Not this time.

01:14:20.126 --> 01:14:21.919
Your soft-skinned mother?

01:14:22.086 --> 01:14:24.005
- Your Gunslinger friends?
- Face me.

01:14:24.172 --> 01:14:25.757
Your whimpering excuse for a dad.

01:14:25.923 --> 01:14:29.385
Stop hiding behind your
magic and face me, Walter!

01:14:31.304 --> 01:14:34.265
We both know that no matter who
crosses the finish line first...

01:14:34.432 --> 01:14:37.435
...the universe will die out eventually.

01:14:37.935 --> 01:14:40.188
Death always wins.

01:14:40.354 --> 01:14:42.064
That's the deal.

01:14:50.448 --> 01:14:52.158
No, no.

01:14:54.744 --> 01:14:55.787
Roland.

01:14:56.621 --> 01:14:58.289
<i>Roland.</i>

01:15:19.936 --> 01:15:22.355
Yeah!

01:15:29.904 --> 01:15:32.824
Jake Chambers.

01:15:40.289 --> 01:15:44.836
You are the full package, as advertised.

01:15:47.171 --> 01:15:49.632
Sayre, get ready.

01:15:49.799 --> 01:15:52.844
Tall, dark and handsome is
about to crash the party.

01:16:13.573 --> 01:16:15.741
Let's go, let's go! Move, move!

01:16:15.908 --> 01:16:16.993
Take one and go.

01:16:22.456 --> 01:16:26.335
Alrighty. Let's go put everyone
out of their misery, shall we?

01:16:26.502 --> 01:16:28.087
Any time, champ.

01:16:46.063 --> 01:16:47.398
Roland.

01:16:55.281 --> 01:16:56.824
<i>Roland...</i>

01:16:56.991 --> 01:16:58.784
<i>...they're taking me to that place.</i>

01:16:58.951 --> 01:17:00.453
<i>Be careful.</i>

01:17:00.620 --> 01:17:01.787
Hang on.

01:17:01.954 --> 01:17:03.372
I'm coming for you.

01:17:18.346 --> 01:17:19.847
We'll get him, sir.

01:17:20.222 --> 01:17:21.432
Bye.

01:17:23.851 --> 01:17:25.937
Have a great apocalypse.

01:17:28.481 --> 01:17:30.274
Close in on him!

01:17:33.945 --> 01:17:35.446
<i>Okay-</i>

01:17:50.544 --> 01:17:51.754
Let's go. MAN: Sir.

01:17:51.921 --> 01:17:53.798
We're online!

01:18:02.682 --> 01:18:06.185
- It's really gonna happen, isn't it?
- Oh, yes, it is.

01:19:22.803 --> 01:19:24.847
Something's wrong.

01:19:26.140 --> 01:19:29.810
Something's wrong here. The
levels are plateauing.

01:19:29.977 --> 01:19:31.979
- It's as if he's...
- Fighting back.

01:19:34.148 --> 01:19:36.400
Why do you resist?

01:19:36.567 --> 01:19:39.007
Your visions didn't bring you
to him, they brought you to me.

01:19:39.695 --> 01:19:41.495
He doesn't love you. He
doesn't care for you.

01:19:41.655 --> 01:19:44.992
In fact, he's been using you
this entire time to get to me.

01:19:45.159 --> 01:19:48.287
This is why you're here.
This is your destiny.

01:19:48.454 --> 01:19:50.456
You killed my mom!

01:19:50.623 --> 01:19:52.583
Yes, that's it. There we go.

01:20:52.017 --> 01:20:53.727
Portal. Close it.

01:20:56.522 --> 01:20:58.440
- Close it!
- I can't!

01:21:00.568 --> 01:21:01.944
Wait.

01:21:04.071 --> 01:21:06.490
Oh, my God. It's the kid.

01:21:06.657 --> 01:21:09.493
It's the kid! He's
keeping the portal open!

01:21:10.870 --> 01:21:13.289
Ahh. Impressive.

01:21:20.171 --> 01:21:22.089
So you wanted me to
face you, old friend?

01:21:24.550 --> 01:21:25.801
Here I am.

01:22:15.809 --> 01:22:18.979
It's fitting that you and the
Tower should fall together.

01:23:10.406 --> 01:23:11.448
Roland.

01:23:14.410 --> 01:23:16.370
<i>Roland, get up.</i>

01:23:21.875 --> 01:23:24.211
<i>I do not aim with my hand.</i>

01:23:24.378 --> 01:23:27.965
<i>He who aims with his hand has
forgotten the face of his father.</i>

01:23:28.757 --> 01:23:30.259
<i>I aim with my eye.</i>

01:23:35.681 --> 01:23:37.725
<i>I do not shoot with my hand.</i>

01:23:37.891 --> 01:23:39.518
<i>He who shoots with his hand...</i>

01:23:39.685 --> 01:23:42.563
Has forgotten the face of his father.

01:23:43.731 --> 01:23:44.940
<i>I shoot with my mind.</i>

01:23:45.107 --> 01:23:47.026
I shoot with my mind.

01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:50.696
<i>I do not kill with my gun.</i>

01:23:52.489 --> 01:23:54.616
He who kills with his gun...

01:23:54.783 --> 01:23:56.503
<i>Has forgotten the face of his father.</i>

01:23:56.577 --> 01:23:59.330
Has forgotten the face of his father.

01:24:05.419 --> 01:24:06.837
I kill with my heart.

01:25:46.812 --> 01:25:48.230
Mom, Dad.

01:25:48.397 --> 01:25:49.898
- There they are.
- Sweetheart.

01:25:50.065 --> 01:25:52.025
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.

01:25:58.755 --> 01:26:00.262
Multiple witnesses saw...

01:26:00.287 --> 01:26:01.886
<i>...the strange phenomena in the sky.</i>

01:26:01.910 --> 01:26:03.510
<i>Looks like we've seen the worst of it...</i>

01:26:03.534 --> 01:26:05.812
The weather center has now
<i>issued</i> a statement...

01:26:05.836 --> 01:26:08.714
<i>...that it may have been some
kind of very intense solar flare.</i>

01:26:11.295 --> 01:26:13.297
Here. ROLAND: What is this?

01:26:13.464 --> 01:26:15.716
- Thank you.
- Thanks. Hot dog.

01:26:15.883 --> 01:26:17.676
Savages.

01:26:19.595 --> 01:26:20.679
What breed?

01:26:20.846 --> 01:26:22.431
No, it's not a breed.

01:26:30.189 --> 01:26:31.815
I have to leave here, Jake.

01:26:33.192 --> 01:26:35.360
You understand that, don't you?

01:26:36.403 --> 01:26:37.863
I know.

01:26:45.245 --> 01:26:46.580
Why don't you come with me?

01:26:51.585 --> 01:26:53.086
Really?

01:26:54.046 --> 01:26:55.923
You have nothing here.

01:26:56.089 --> 01:26:59.051
Besides, I could use your help.

01:26:59.343 --> 01:27:00.844
Uh...

01:27:01.553 --> 01:27:03.430
Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

01:27:04.264 --> 01:27:05.641
Gunslinger.
