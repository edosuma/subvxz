00:03.220 --> 00:05.958
Oh, finally, a detective!

00:05.993 --> 00:09.161
I phoned this in
more than 10 minutes ago!

00:09.975 --> 00:12.085
People say there's
no crime in the Palisades,

00:12.120 --> 00:15.088
but, uh, I'd call this
a crime, wouldn't you?

00:15.123 --> 00:16.689
Uh-huh.

00:16.725 --> 00:17.790
It's a crime.

00:17.826 --> 00:19.955
And we need to tent off this car.

00:21.229 --> 00:24.063
I'm thinking the two shots
were fired from about here,

00:24.099 --> 00:25.598
pretty close up.

00:25.633 --> 00:27.700
Oh, well, thank you
for joining us, Julio.

00:27.736 --> 00:29.268
I'm sorry I'm late, sir.

00:29.304 --> 00:32.005
I had to wake my neighbor
and ask her to look after Mark.

00:32.040 --> 00:33.973
So, what'd I miss?

00:34.009 --> 00:37.643
Well, earlier tonight,
the one-and-only Bonnie Pearl,

00:37.679 --> 00:40.179
lawyer to the downtrodden and abused,

00:40.215 --> 00:42.849
was shot to death
parked in the middle of the road

00:42.884 --> 00:44.984
behind the wheel of her Mercedes.

00:45.020 --> 00:46.386
So, what happened?

00:46.421 --> 00:50.289
She stopped, rolled down the
passenger window, and adios?

00:50.325 --> 00:51.591
Ha!

00:51.626 --> 00:54.093
You know who people in
the Palisades stop for?

00:54.129 --> 00:55.995
Nobody. Who the hell are you?

00:56.031 --> 00:58.231
Frank Boggs. AKV Security.

00:58.266 --> 00:59.557
He was first on the scene.

00:59.592 --> 01:00.767
I tell you what, Frank.

01:00.802 --> 01:02.835
Why don't you take
a little stroll outside

01:02.871 --> 01:05.471
and see if you can find
anything we may have missed?

01:05.507 --> 01:07.073
Of course, sir.

01:07.108 --> 01:10.943
Ah, keep on eye on
Barney Fife here, if you would,

01:10.979 --> 01:13.613
in case he decides to walk off
with some souvenirs.

01:13.648 --> 01:15.615
Ah, that's why we couldn't find casings.

01:15.650 --> 01:19.185
My guess? A copper-jacketed .38
fired from a revolver.

01:19.220 --> 01:20.520
Kendall?

01:20.555 --> 01:22.021
It's very straightforward, guys.

01:22.057 --> 01:23.990
Our victim faced the shooter
and one bullet struck her

01:24.025 --> 01:25.658
above the nasal cavity,
passing out the back

01:25.693 --> 01:27.960
of her skull and through
the driver's side window.

01:27.996 --> 01:30.730
- She died instantly.
- Oh, my God.

01:30.765 --> 01:34.133
- What? What?!
- These pearls... They're fake!

01:34.169 --> 01:35.435
- What?
- Those pearls

01:35.470 --> 01:37.003
were her signature. And they're phony?

01:37.038 --> 01:38.971
Might explain why someone took the purse

01:39.007 --> 01:40.373
and not the necklace.

01:40.834 --> 01:43.309
This is what I'm talking about!

01:43.344 --> 01:44.977
All right, Frank. What is it?

01:45.013 --> 01:47.313
Must have ricocheted under a shrub.

01:47.348 --> 01:48.948
Take a look.

01:48.983 --> 01:53.138
It's a solid-lead, bullnose,
medium-caliber bullet, sir.

01:54.097 --> 01:55.955
Two different bullets.

01:55.990 --> 01:57.824
Two different guns.

01:58.310 --> 01:59.892
This is the bullet
that killed your victim.

01:59.928 --> 02:02.028
It's the only one
that tested positive for blood

02:02.063 --> 02:05.231
and, unlike the pearl necklace,
it's very real.

02:05.266 --> 02:08.067
Commander, what are you doing
here in the first place?

02:08.103 --> 02:12.105
I mean, I think we can
handle an autopsy prelim.

02:12.140 --> 02:15.108
It's a very high-profile murder
of a prominent attorney.

02:15.143 --> 02:18.111
And two kinds of bullets
suggest that there are

02:18.146 --> 02:19.612
two killers lying in wait.

02:19.647 --> 02:21.981
Yes, but Bonnie's purse was stolen.

02:22.016 --> 02:23.850
I mean, this murder could be random.

02:23.885 --> 02:26.953
Nothing random happens in the Palisades.

02:27.506 --> 02:30.256
Bonnie Pearl was always
David taking on Goliath.

02:30.291 --> 02:32.625
Could be some Goliath
hired a couple of shooters

02:32.660 --> 02:34.293
to fight back.

02:34.329 --> 02:35.962
Would Craig Curtis qualify?

02:35.997 --> 02:38.798
- Uh, who's Craig Curtis?
- Who's Craig Curtis?

02:38.833 --> 02:41.968
Former Heisman Trophy winner,
first round draft pick.

02:42.003 --> 02:45.004
Oh. Well, it's not like he was
nominated for an Oscar.

02:45.039 --> 02:48.741
Craig Curtis was injured his
fourth season in the pros.

02:48.776 --> 02:52.111
He retired. He started a chain
of restaurants, didn't he?

02:52.147 --> 02:54.547
Oh, yeah. Um, Tackles!

02:54.582 --> 02:58.620
Huge TVs, big burgers, cute girls.

02:59.663 --> 03:02.655
Tasteless... the way they dress
those waitresses there.

03:02.690 --> 03:04.724
There's a reason they
call them "breastaurants."

03:04.759 --> 03:07.760
Right. Well, Bonnie Pearl
was representing several

03:07.795 --> 03:09.996
former Tackles employees who are suing

03:10.031 --> 03:13.099
for having been forced to retire
at the ripe old age of 30.

03:13.134 --> 03:15.201
- Really?
- Well, that sounds reasonable.

03:15.236 --> 03:19.071
Who wants to go the same job
their whole life long?

03:19.107 --> 03:22.008
And I'm telling you, if Bonnie Pearl

03:22.043 --> 03:26.345
had her sights on Craig Curtis,
then he had a motive.

03:26.381 --> 03:28.314
Amy, check Bonnie Pearl's Wikipedia page.

03:28.349 --> 03:31.450
Didn't she go through
a tough divorce recently?

03:31.486 --> 03:33.753
Ah, yes, from Jerry Pearl.

03:33.788 --> 03:37.423
Wow. It says she pays him
$15,000 a month in alimony.

03:37.458 --> 03:39.492
You don't kill someone who's paying you

03:39.527 --> 03:40.893
a ton of spousal support.

03:40.929 --> 03:42.895
No, or I would've been dead 30 years ago.

03:42.931 --> 03:44.597
I'm not finding Jerry Pearl in L.A.

03:44.632 --> 03:46.132
What about her son?

03:46.167 --> 03:47.500
Uh, Stan Pearl.

03:47.535 --> 03:49.101
Says he's an associate at her firm.

03:49.137 --> 03:51.103
Well, I think
it's time that we did a good

03:51.139 --> 03:53.272
once-over at Bonnie's office.

03:53.308 --> 03:55.975
We should try to notify
Bonnie's son and her ex-husband

03:56.010 --> 03:58.177
before they hear about
all this on the news.

03:59.380 --> 04:01.247
LAPD.

04:01.282 --> 04:03.983
Why is the press here?
Did they show up on their own?

04:04.018 --> 04:06.953
No, Bonnie's holding a news
conference when she arrives.

04:06.988 --> 04:08.120
Regarding?

04:08.156 --> 04:11.591
Wrongfully terminated Tackles employees.

04:11.626 --> 04:13.259
May I help you with something?

04:13.294 --> 04:14.560
What? Help us?

04:14.596 --> 04:16.728
Uh, oh, yeah.

04:16.764 --> 04:19.065
Uh, we'd like to see
Ms. Pearl's appointment calendar

04:19.100 --> 04:20.966
and call logs for the past week.

04:21.002 --> 04:24.503
Oh. I can't share that with you.

04:24.539 --> 04:25.805
Coffee?

04:25.840 --> 04:27.673
Excuse me, Detectives. Leslie Kraus,

04:27.709 --> 04:29.175
Bonnie's personal assistant.

04:29.210 --> 04:31.711
We need her permission
to show you her schedule.

04:31.746 --> 04:33.879
- She'll be here shortly.
- Oh, I doubt that, ma'am.

04:33.915 --> 04:35.915
Can you tell us where
Ms. Pearl's son is, please?

04:35.950 --> 04:38.084
Stan can't override me.

04:38.119 --> 04:40.820
Bonnie's call logs are
privileged and confidential,

04:40.855 --> 04:42.154
and I... Actually, they're not.

04:42.190 --> 04:44.457
And we have a warrant.

04:44.492 --> 04:46.592
Fine, Lucy, go ahead and print up

04:46.628 --> 04:48.027
Bonnie's appointment calendar.

04:48.062 --> 04:49.528
Where would we find Stan Pearl, please?

04:49.564 --> 04:51.130
We're not asking again.

04:51.165 --> 04:54.945
In the office down the hall,
just past the supply closet.

04:55.737 --> 04:58.824
- Uh, Lieutenant?
- Hmm?

04:59.707 --> 05:02.341
I should, uh, speak to
the wrongfully terminated

05:02.377 --> 05:05.878
ladies just to eliminate
them as suspects.

05:05.913 --> 05:08.281
Wes, these women were her clients.

05:08.316 --> 05:11.150
What motive could they possibly have?

05:11.185 --> 05:14.253
We're not leaving here till I find out.

05:14.289 --> 05:16.255
Okay, look.

05:16.291 --> 05:18.090
For five years, I lived undercover

05:18.126 --> 05:20.326
surrounded by girls
with swastikas tattooed

05:20.361 --> 05:22.428
on their bodies, okay?

05:22.463 --> 05:23.763
Maybe I'm a little desperate,

05:23.798 --> 05:26.601
but I have to start
meeting new people, sir.

05:27.435 --> 05:29.235
Go. Go.

05:35.276 --> 05:37.543
Sorry to interrupt. Detective Sanchez.

05:37.578 --> 05:39.945
Detective Paige. LAPD Major Crimes.

05:39.981 --> 05:42.315
We need to talk to you
about your mother, sir.

05:42.350 --> 05:43.883
It'll have to wait.

05:43.918 --> 05:46.252
I'm helping her with a news
conference any second now.

05:46.287 --> 05:48.454
You have more time than you think.

05:48.489 --> 05:50.589
Could you tell us where
your mother was last night?

05:50.625 --> 05:53.893
Uh, at a late meeting with
our clients in the Tackles case.

05:53.928 --> 05:57.263
And when did you last
speak with her, sir?

05:59.000 --> 06:02.368
Uh, she said hello to me
in the hallway yesterday.

06:02.403 --> 06:05.771
And your father? Any idea
where we might find him?

06:05.807 --> 06:07.306
Sleeping with whatever barfly

06:07.342 --> 06:09.342
was sitting next to him at last call?

06:09.377 --> 06:10.910
We're not close.

06:10.945 --> 06:12.445
What's this about?

06:12.480 --> 06:13.746
I'm sorry, Mr. Pearl.

06:13.781 --> 06:16.315
But just after midnight,
your mother was found

06:16.351 --> 06:20.653
shot to death in her vehicle,
a short distance from her house.

06:23.257 --> 06:24.557
You're mistaken.

06:24.592 --> 06:26.959
This is a publicity stunt
of some kind, isn't it?

06:26.994 --> 06:29.161
It's not a publicity stunt.

06:29.748 --> 06:32.898
Mr. Pearl, do you still
own a condo on Blazedale Drive

06:32.934 --> 06:34.867
about a mile south
of your mother's estate?

06:34.902 --> 06:37.203
Uh, yes. Yes, wait.

06:37.238 --> 06:40.342
Hold on. She's really dead?

06:42.210 --> 06:43.803
Oh, God.

06:44.512 --> 06:46.712
Oh, God!

06:48.983 --> 06:52.118
This is gonna be really big news!

06:52.153 --> 06:54.487
Mr. Pearl, we prefer that you not make

06:54.522 --> 06:56.386
a public statement
about your mother's death.

06:56.421 --> 06:58.290
We're only just getting
started investigating.

06:58.326 --> 07:00.426
Well, this isn't about you, is it?

07:00.461 --> 07:02.962
No. It's about your mother
and finding her killer.

07:02.997 --> 07:05.097
Right. You do your job.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.535
I'll do mine.

07:07.435 --> 07:09.135
Leslie?! Oh, Leslie?

07:09.170 --> 07:12.037
I need you to pull my mom's
estate documents ASAP.

07:12.073 --> 07:15.274
And follow the trail of
empty liquor bottles to my dad.

07:15.309 --> 07:17.977
Oh. And tell him if he even
thinks about trying to sue

07:18.012 --> 07:19.845
for my Mom's assets, I will crush him

07:19.881 --> 07:21.447
like a bug.

07:21.482 --> 07:22.748
Crush him!

07:22.784 --> 07:24.850
Her assets? What?

07:24.886 --> 07:27.447
We're getting started early.

07:28.523 --> 07:30.856
Here. Come together.

07:30.892 --> 07:32.825
All right, come together. Tighter.

07:32.860 --> 07:35.294
Okay. I begin today with terrible news.

07:35.329 --> 07:37.997
<i>Last night, while traveling
home from a work session</i>

07:38.032 --> 07:40.766
<i>with these women, who were wrongfully</i>

07:40.802 --> 07:43.536
terminated by Tackles restaurants,

07:43.571 --> 07:46.241
my mother, Bonnie Pearl,

07:46.741 --> 07:48.841
was assassinated in her car.

07:49.411 --> 07:51.143
Please, please.

07:51.179 --> 07:52.812
Oh, I'm sorry.

07:52.847 --> 07:54.713
Excuse us. I'm sorry.

07:54.749 --> 07:56.282
I'm so sorry.

07:56.317 --> 07:59.718
<i>My mother's, uh, personal
journey may be over,</i>

07:59.754 --> 08:02.988
<i>but her mission continues,
and her spirit presses us on.</i>

08:03.024 --> 08:04.723
Buzz, turn that down.

08:04.759 --> 08:06.292
I guess the cat's out of the bag.

08:06.327 --> 08:09.028
Out of the bag? It was just
run over by an 18-wheeler.

08:09.063 --> 08:13.666
Stan Pearl seems to be something
of a chip off the old block.

08:13.701 --> 08:15.234
More like a splinter.

08:15.269 --> 08:16.969
Well, he's certainly
turned this investigation

08:17.004 --> 08:18.904
into an all-out Major Crime.

08:18.940 --> 08:20.673
Buzz, the volume?

08:20.708 --> 08:23.609
<i>...and we will use
every last legal resource</i>

08:23.644 --> 08:27.546
<i>at our disposal to make sure
that justice is served!</i>

08:27.582 --> 08:30.382
And we will do that, too.

08:30.918 --> 08:32.453
<i>Thank you.</i>

08:34.000 --> 08:40.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:43.195 --> 08:44.661
Hey. Hey.

08:45.605 --> 08:47.096
- I have it.
- No, I'll carry it. No, I got it.

08:47.131 --> 08:48.365
Don't just grab it from me
and shut the door.

08:48.400 --> 08:51.001
Gus, I said I have it.
At least let me say a decent goodbye.

08:51.036 --> 08:53.270
This may be the last time
we see each other.

08:53.575 --> 08:56.039
You really want it to go this way?

09:04.950 --> 09:07.684
Don't apologize again
for sleeping with Aiden.

09:07.720 --> 09:09.553
I don't want to hear
how sorry you are, okay?

09:09.588 --> 09:11.188
Okay.

09:13.792 --> 09:15.158
What's that on your wall?

09:15.194 --> 09:19.062
Oh. Uh, those are people
who died recently,

09:19.098 --> 09:22.420
and they're connected to Phillip Stroh.

09:22.935 --> 09:24.434
It doesn't concern you.

09:24.470 --> 09:25.535
How can you say that?

09:25.571 --> 09:27.137
Of course I'm concerned.

09:27.172 --> 09:29.006
Phillip Stroh?

09:29.041 --> 09:30.807
- Are you safe?
- Gus, I... I have

09:30.843 --> 09:33.577
an undercover detail
that goes with me everywhere.

09:33.612 --> 09:36.713
They're outside right now,
monitoring the garage

09:36.749 --> 09:38.248
and the elevators and the stairs.

09:38.284 --> 09:40.550
And they clear the condo
every time I come inside.

09:40.586 --> 09:42.319
I am 100% safe.

09:42.354 --> 09:43.920
A gun? Seriously?

09:43.956 --> 09:46.487
I... Sorry. I didn't...

09:47.526 --> 09:50.894
think you that you would be
coming back to my room.

09:50.929 --> 09:52.659
And this isn't...

09:54.266 --> 09:55.662
Wait.

09:57.670 --> 09:59.870
This isn't mine.

10:00.250 --> 10:03.086
This is a gift that I gave to you.

10:04.119 --> 10:05.619
Unless, of course, you don't want it.

10:05.644 --> 10:06.943
I do.

10:07.507 --> 10:09.300
I... I just thought...

10:10.482 --> 10:12.011
I'll read it.

10:13.619 --> 10:15.152
Look...

10:15.187 --> 10:17.254
I won't say I'm sorry again.

10:17.289 --> 10:20.057
But I will say that it's not
just you and me I screwed up.

10:20.092 --> 10:23.126
My whole life is just kind of ruined.

10:23.162 --> 10:24.661
How come?

10:25.108 --> 10:26.730
You know what I'm doing right now?

10:27.318 --> 10:29.612
I'm waiting tables at a diner.

10:30.502 --> 10:31.968
Why are you doing that?

10:32.004 --> 10:34.504
When... When I messed up
and I did what I did

10:34.540 --> 10:38.663
with Aiden, and then I stopped because...

10:39.345 --> 10:41.745
because I was still in love with you,

10:42.250 --> 10:44.815
he fired me and said I couldn't
use him as a reference.

10:44.850 --> 10:47.250
Oh. How many times?

10:47.286 --> 10:48.482
What?

10:48.517 --> 10:50.938
Did you "mess up" with Aiden?

10:50.974 --> 10:52.689
How many times? You never did tell me.

10:52.725 --> 10:54.220
Was it three?

10:55.494 --> 10:57.015
Six?

10:58.564 --> 11:00.643
You can't remember?

11:04.036 --> 11:05.268
What do you need a gun for

11:05.304 --> 11:07.692
when you always go for the jugular?

11:09.569 --> 11:11.166
You have a good life, Rusty.

11:12.411 --> 11:16.326
I hope one day, we can be friends.

11:17.216 --> 11:18.620
Maybe.

11:32.731 --> 11:35.432
We weren't trying to go
back to the way things were.

11:35.467 --> 11:37.401
We just wanted to reach a settlement.

11:37.436 --> 11:39.803
And to stop Tackles... or Craig, really,

11:39.838 --> 11:42.685
because Craig is Tackles...
from doing this to other women.

11:42.721 --> 11:45.475
Just to understand...
the contracts at all

11:45.511 --> 11:50.213
Tackles restaurants specify
you are models, not servers?

11:50.249 --> 11:52.115
Calling us models gives Craig

11:52.151 --> 11:54.184
a big say over our appearance.

11:54.219 --> 11:57.187
Like how much we can weigh
and how old we can be.

11:57.222 --> 12:00.357
Our contracts expire
on the day we turn 30.

12:00.392 --> 12:03.360
'Cause everyone knows men can't
look at a 30-year-old woman

12:03.395 --> 12:04.394
without vomiting.

12:04.430 --> 12:06.496
Wow. Now, that is really, really rude.

12:06.532 --> 12:11.234
Mm-hmm. And what does this
cordiality waiver mean?

12:11.270 --> 12:13.470
Basically, whenever a guy slaps our ass,

12:13.505 --> 12:16.339
we had to be a good "teammate"
and laugh it off.

12:16.375 --> 12:17.941
Craig told me,

12:17.976 --> 12:19.042
"Men come to Tackles

12:19.077 --> 12:21.077
<i>for beer, burgers and boobs."</i>

12:21.113 --> 12:23.213
<i>I think he was limiting my contributions.</i>

12:23.248 --> 12:25.515
- Hmm. I don't know.
- Chief!

12:25.551 --> 12:28.652
What? No, I just mean
this cordiality clause

12:28.687 --> 12:30.353
sound ridiculous.

12:30.389 --> 12:31.822
Back me up, guys.

12:31.857 --> 12:33.089
Back me up.

12:33.125 --> 12:35.358
You're backing up just fine on your own.

12:35.394 --> 12:37.494
<i>They put out a calendar every year,</i>

12:37.529 --> 12:39.963
<i>and then they pressure
us into posing for it.</i>

12:39.998 --> 12:41.049
<i>Here.</i>

12:42.537 --> 12:45.035
I'm September 2017.

12:45.070 --> 12:48.104
It's just a little past August.

12:50.609 --> 12:52.309
You can see how they make us look.

12:52.344 --> 12:55.312
Oh, Past August.

12:55.347 --> 12:57.948
Last night, Bonnie said
she was negotiating with Craig,

12:57.983 --> 12:59.749
but didn't want to take his first offer.

12:59.785 --> 13:02.452
Look, I know he's a scumbag,
but at least this guy Curtis

13:02.488 --> 13:04.454
told the women what
they were signing up for.

13:04.490 --> 13:07.691
It doesn't matter how well
Tackles explained things.

13:07.726 --> 13:10.627
Yeah, you can't legally
agree to be molested.

13:10.662 --> 13:11.828
It voids the contract.

13:11.864 --> 13:13.563
That's exactly what I was saying.

13:13.599 --> 13:15.332
<i>...until we can figure out what's next.</i>

13:15.367 --> 13:17.701
You guys, we've all been forced into

13:17.736 --> 13:19.636
a major, major career change.

13:19.671 --> 13:24.007
Man, this calendar is...
very offensive, Commander.

13:24.042 --> 13:26.443
Um... so last night,

13:26.478 --> 13:29.579
you're in this diner
together when Bonnie leaves.

13:29.615 --> 13:32.415
We all stayed behind.
Well, except Vanessa.

13:32.451 --> 13:35.619
Vanessa has a different idea
on how she thinks

13:35.654 --> 13:37.020
the settlement should work.

13:37.055 --> 13:39.689
Because there
is not enough money in the world

13:39.725 --> 13:41.424
to compensate me.

13:41.460 --> 13:44.127
Trying to put a dollar amount
on what happened,

13:44.162 --> 13:45.362
it's infuriating.

13:45.397 --> 13:47.163
We can't get her to reasonable.

13:47.199 --> 13:50.033
And that's a problem because
Craig won't settle

13:50.068 --> 13:52.135
unless we all a...
Would you quit making this

13:52.170 --> 13:54.070
all my fault?!

14:00.178 --> 14:01.778
I don't know what's gotten into her.

14:01.813 --> 14:04.981
But the rest of us, we just
want to cash out and move on.

14:05.017 --> 14:06.283
But now that Bonnie's dead,

14:06.318 --> 14:08.885
I guess that really depends on Stan.

14:08.921 --> 14:10.420
It's a shame this guy Craig Curtis

14:10.455 --> 14:12.622
was at work last night
surrounded by customers.

14:12.658 --> 14:14.157
Otherwise, he'd be perfect for this.

14:14.192 --> 14:16.359
Here they are, Lieutenant.

14:16.395 --> 14:18.562
Gosh, there's about 40 of them.

14:19.932 --> 14:21.498
We found so many press conferences

14:21.533 --> 14:23.533
where Bonnie Pearl
attacked powerful people,

14:23.569 --> 14:25.769
that we've only pulled video
on cases where she took out

14:25.804 --> 14:27.470
restraining orders
against the defendants.

14:27.506 --> 14:30.674
Like rock star Troy Matthews,
who was accused of groping

14:30.709 --> 14:31.808
his kid's nanny.

14:31.843 --> 14:33.677
Oh. That makes me mad.

14:33.712 --> 14:35.645
All right, Julio.
Then why don't you find out

14:35.681 --> 14:37.314
where Troy was last night?

14:37.349 --> 14:39.883
Yeah, and who he was with.
There were two shooters.

14:39.918 --> 14:42.819
Then we have real estate
developer Kyle Bixby,

14:42.854 --> 14:47.090
accused of defrauding
his fiancée, a Tibetan princess,

14:47.125 --> 14:48.959
before jilting her at the altar.

14:48.994 --> 14:50.694
Can we turn up her talking about this

14:50.729 --> 14:52.295
Kyle Bixby for a moment?

14:52.331 --> 14:55.332
<i>I demand respect for all of my clients,</i>

14:55.367 --> 14:58.201
<i>regardless of income, social status,</i>

14:58.236 --> 14:59.603
<i>or country of origin.</i>

14:59.638 --> 15:04.074
<i>Mr. Bixby is worse than a fraud.</i>

15:04.109 --> 15:06.476
<i>He is an emotional rapist.</i>

15:06.511 --> 15:07.944
Oh. I'll take Kyle and company,

15:07.980 --> 15:10.547
though he sounds like a guy
who would hire somebody.

15:11.012 --> 15:13.049
She may have had
the charm of a car alarm,

15:13.085 --> 15:14.584
but she was pretty hard to ignore.

15:14.620 --> 15:17.253
Well, no one can deny
she turned press conferences

15:17.289 --> 15:18.588
into an art form.

15:18.624 --> 15:22.125
Speaking of artists, our primary suspect

15:22.160 --> 15:24.327
from this list was
film director Erik Walsh.

15:24.363 --> 15:27.263
Anyone remember this video
that went viral of him

15:27.299 --> 15:29.299
losing it on the set of his last movie?

15:29.334 --> 15:31.267
<i>You're not gonna take your top off?!</i>

15:31.303 --> 15:32.802
<i>You've known this scene has been coming</i>

15:32.838 --> 15:34.270
<i>for the whole movie!</i>

15:34.306 --> 15:36.373
<i>Where the are you going, Craig?</i>

15:36.408 --> 15:37.741
- Remember it?
<i>- That's right, get off my set!</i>

15:37.776 --> 15:39.909
How can we forget it?
They show this video

15:39.945 --> 15:41.978
every year at our
sexual harassment seminar.

15:42.014 --> 15:43.780
<i>You're getting paid sick money
to show those tits!</i>

15:43.815 --> 15:45.548
<i>All you do is just remove it.</i>

15:45.584 --> 15:47.384
<i>You did it when you were a little kid.</i>

15:47.419 --> 15:49.619
We all have 'em, look! Boobies!

15:49.655 --> 15:51.087
Big deal!

15:51.123 --> 15:53.323
Look, nothing... Nobody cares

15:53.358 --> 15:55.525
if you take your clothes off!

15:55.560 --> 15:57.127
<i>I'm gonna give you a little advice.</i>

15:57.162 --> 15:59.996
<i>You should show your tits now
because in a couple years,</i>

16:00.032 --> 16:02.866
<i>no one's gonna want to see 'em
and you're only gonna get hired</i>

16:02.901 --> 16:04.267
<i>for your "talent."</i>

16:04.302 --> 16:07.037
<i>Get off my set! Get off my set.</i>

16:07.072 --> 16:09.472
<i>Steve, if you cut, I swear to...</i>

16:09.508 --> 16:11.207
Didn't Erik Walsh
have to pay out something like

16:11.243 --> 16:12.609
$2 million to this young lady?

16:12.644 --> 16:15.178
Yes, and afterwards, he was
picked up multiple times

16:15.213 --> 16:17.847
on or about Bonnie Pearl's estate.

16:17.883 --> 16:20.884
Was it six months ago, Buzz?

16:23.755 --> 16:26.256
And then, we have these.

16:31.063 --> 16:34.431
This Erik Walsh dirtbag
obviously wanted to strike back

16:34.466 --> 16:36.266
at Bonnie Pearl for quite some time.

16:36.301 --> 16:38.702
But she was driving home alone at night.

16:38.737 --> 16:41.471
She had to know how much Walsh hated her.

16:41.506 --> 16:44.474
Why would she stop her car for him?

16:44.509 --> 16:47.277
That's an excellent question.

16:47.312 --> 16:49.646
Excellent!

16:51.483 --> 16:54.651
Look. As an Uber driver,
I was well within my rights

16:54.686 --> 16:56.753
to throw that guy out of my Prius.

16:56.788 --> 16:58.488
He took his shoes off!

16:58.523 --> 17:00.156
And he was smoking pot!

17:00.192 --> 17:02.025
We don't care about that.

17:02.060 --> 17:03.693
- What?
- Look, we brought you here

17:03.729 --> 17:08.364
because Bonnie Pearl was found
shot to death late last night.

17:08.400 --> 17:09.699
Shot to death?

17:09.734 --> 17:11.501
Mmm.

17:11.536 --> 17:13.169
Wow.

17:13.204 --> 17:14.938
Oh!

17:14.973 --> 17:17.406
You think I was involved
because the bitch cost me

17:17.442 --> 17:19.709
everything I own
and has me in directing jail

17:19.744 --> 17:21.711
for the past five years
and counting, huh?

17:21.747 --> 17:24.547
<i>Andy, FYI... "directing jail" means</i>

17:24.583 --> 17:27.650
no one would hire Walsh to direct.

17:27.685 --> 17:30.153
<i>You honestly think weren't
smart enough to</i>

17:30.188 --> 17:31.521
figure that out?!

17:31.556 --> 17:34.057
No, I'm pretty sure it's obvious.

17:34.092 --> 17:37.260
What are you,
the bad cop or something, huh?

17:37.295 --> 17:40.196
Why don't you take it easy there, pal.

17:40.232 --> 17:41.965
Where were you last night?

17:42.000 --> 17:44.134
I was in my studio apartment.

17:44.169 --> 17:46.836
That's where I live... in Koreatown.

17:46.872 --> 17:48.204
Was anybody with you?

17:48.240 --> 17:50.740
No! If you asked a month ago,
I would've told you my wife.

17:50.776 --> 17:54.177
But since she left me for
an actor... a freaking actor!...

17:54.212 --> 17:55.411
and filed for divorce

17:55.447 --> 17:57.080
<i>last Friday, no, I was alone.</i>

17:57.115 --> 17:59.983
His wife leaving him might
answer the timing of it all.

18:00.018 --> 18:04.254
But why would Bonnie stop
for Mr. Walsh and a friend?

18:04.289 --> 18:06.823
<i>Well, according to LAPD records,</i>

18:06.858 --> 18:08.725
<i>you spray-painted Bonnie Pearl's</i>

18:08.760 --> 18:11.661
front gate with curse words,
dug through her trash

18:11.696 --> 18:13.530
for compromising information...

18:13.565 --> 18:15.665
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I keyed her car.

18:15.700 --> 18:18.701
I, uh, slashed her tires.
I drained her pool.

18:18.737 --> 18:22.305
Well actually, that's not listed here.

18:22.340 --> 18:24.007
Well, you know what? Whatever! Okay?

18:24.042 --> 18:26.843
I was nothing compared
to what that hag did to me!

18:26.878 --> 18:28.344
And for what?

18:28.380 --> 18:31.281
I was only asking
some ludicrously overpaid

18:31.316 --> 18:33.716
actress to follow the script!

18:33.752 --> 18:37.387
And yes, I undressed in front of her...

18:38.159 --> 18:39.756
and 90 members of the crew.

18:39.791 --> 18:44.427
But the nakedness was to show
<i>my</i> vulnerability, okay?

18:44.462 --> 18:46.396
Stuff like that happens every minute

18:46.431 --> 18:48.031
<i>of every day in Hollywood.</i>

18:48.066 --> 18:50.767
<i>So you didn't do anything wrong?</i>

18:50.802 --> 18:52.435
I didn't say that, asshole.

18:52.470 --> 18:55.071
I was simply saying
that there's more of a gray area

18:55.106 --> 18:56.573
to this situation

18:56.608 --> 18:59.275
<i>than people outside
the business would think.</i>

18:59.311 --> 19:00.844
<i>Oh, you know what was funny?</i>

19:00.879 --> 19:03.012
<i>As I'm digging through
Bonnie Pearl's garbage,</i>

19:03.048 --> 19:04.280
<i>guess what I found?</i>

19:04.316 --> 19:07.116
<i>Recyclables! Okay? So, yeah.</i>

19:07.152 --> 19:10.386
While she's paintin' me to be
some Neanderthal monster,

19:10.422 --> 19:12.956
Bonnie is refusing to recycle.

19:12.991 --> 19:14.290
Hypocrite!

19:14.762 --> 19:17.894
Well, he seems mad enough
to kill someone.

19:18.432 --> 19:20.129
But two people fired on Pearl.

19:20.165 --> 19:22.665
And who would work with this guy?

19:22.701 --> 19:25.468
The shooter might not
have had an accomplice.

19:25.982 --> 19:27.737
The bullets were different, yes.

19:28.109 --> 19:30.573
But the rifling was,
in all practical ways,

19:30.609 --> 19:31.941
identical on both.

19:31.977 --> 19:33.877
Hold on. Francine,
are you saying two different

19:33.912 --> 19:36.779
kinds of ammunition
were loaded into the same gun?

19:36.815 --> 19:39.482
Sure looks that way. It's crazy, huh?

19:39.517 --> 19:42.485
And the weapon wouldn't jam?
It would just keep firing?

19:42.520 --> 19:44.420
The reports would
be strikingly different.

19:44.456 --> 19:45.822
But it would fire, yes.

19:45.857 --> 19:48.958
So our victim was murdered
by a single shooter?

19:48.994 --> 19:50.660
I don't know how many people were there,

19:50.695 --> 19:53.429
but they only used one gun.

20:01.829 --> 20:03.195
Hey.

20:03.230 --> 20:05.964
What is all that stuff
stacked beside your bed?

20:06.000 --> 20:10.202
Uh, well, Gus insisted
on returning everything

20:10.237 --> 20:11.670
that I left at his place.

20:11.706 --> 20:13.772
So he came by. How'd that go?

20:13.808 --> 20:17.209
Ah, we both have other things to do.

20:17.244 --> 20:21.213
I... I have to keep my focus
on getting into law school,

20:21.248 --> 20:26.618
And Gus is struggling
to find a decent job.

20:26.654 --> 20:28.153
Struggling?

20:28.189 --> 20:29.788
Why's he struggling?

20:29.824 --> 20:31.590
Well, because when
they stopped sleeping together,

20:31.625 --> 20:32.758
Aiden fired him.

20:32.793 --> 20:36.161
And wouldn't give Gus a reference.

20:36.197 --> 20:38.063
- What?
- Yeah.

20:38.099 --> 20:41.200
That's the kind of guy that
Gustavo Wallace chose over me.

20:41.235 --> 20:44.203
I'm not sure Gustavo
thought about it that way,

20:44.238 --> 20:48.607
but the way Aiden is treating
him is, in fact, illegal.

20:48.642 --> 20:50.342
- Illegal?
- Mm-hmm.

20:50.377 --> 20:51.777
How?

20:51.812 --> 20:55.481
You can't hold back
references or fire an employee

20:55.516 --> 20:58.450
just because they won't sleep with you.

20:58.486 --> 21:00.152
So you're saying that's a crime?

21:00.187 --> 21:01.820
Well, we don't jail people for it,

21:01.856 --> 21:03.555
but it's against the law, yes!

21:03.591 --> 21:05.991
Gus could sue for damages.

21:06.026 --> 21:08.393
Okay. Well, Gus says the restaurant world

21:08.429 --> 21:12.531
has its own set of rules,
like not ringing up drinks

21:12.566 --> 21:14.166
and money under the table.

21:14.201 --> 21:15.968
It's lots of looking the other way.

21:16.003 --> 21:17.903
It's irrelevant, your Honor.

21:17.938 --> 21:19.671
It may be an atypical workplace,

21:19.707 --> 21:23.891
but it is still covered
by the justice system.

21:24.892 --> 21:26.812
His mother might have
thought he was smart enough

21:26.847 --> 21:30.149
to practice law,
but Mini-Pearl strikes me

21:30.184 --> 21:33.118
as just dumb enough to load
a gun with different bullets.

21:33.154 --> 21:36.054
And Bonnie probably
would've stopped for him.

21:36.090 --> 21:38.190
And lowered her passenger window.

21:38.225 --> 21:39.391
At midnight.

21:39.426 --> 21:42.861
Mini-Pearl... I mean, Stan...
is Bonnie's sole heir.

21:42.897 --> 21:44.663
I mean, except for personal bequests,

21:44.698 --> 21:46.398
he inherits his mom's whole estate,

21:46.433 --> 21:47.966
including her law practice.

21:48.002 --> 21:49.968
And he lives just down the road
from where she was found.

21:50.004 --> 21:52.538
What about our other potential suspects?

21:52.573 --> 21:54.807
Troy, our nanny-groping rock star,

21:54.842 --> 21:56.675
had a good alibi witness, ma'am.

21:56.710 --> 21:58.610
- Who?
- Sydney, Australia,

21:58.646 --> 22:00.179
where he's appearing in concert.

22:00.214 --> 22:03.482
And after Mr. Bixby
jilted his Tibetan princess,

22:03.517 --> 22:04.683
he was convicted of tax evasion.

22:04.718 --> 22:06.151
So he's not really available.

22:06.187 --> 22:08.987
It feels odd that
Craig Curtis isn't down here.

22:09.023 --> 22:12.591
I know he has an alibi,
but Tackles was his whole...

22:12.626 --> 22:14.326
Is it really out of the question?

22:14.361 --> 22:16.929
Bonnie Pearl was about
to attack this guy's business,

22:16.964 --> 22:21.066
and his character, at one of
her famous news conferences.

22:21.101 --> 22:23.101
And Tackles has lots of security people.

22:23.137 --> 22:25.904
Craig wouldn't necessarily have
to pull the trigger himself.

22:25.940 --> 22:28.574
It is possible to follow up on Stan Pearl

22:28.609 --> 22:31.143
and Craig Curtis at the same time.

22:31.178 --> 22:34.479
Mike? Any progress
in decrypting the call logs

22:34.515 --> 22:35.747
from Bonnie's office yet?

22:35.783 --> 22:37.115
Unfortunately, no.

22:37.151 --> 22:39.017
They're kept in a code
that I can't break.

22:39.053 --> 22:43.755
Well, maybe we can find someone
who can decipher this for us.

22:43.791 --> 22:46.058
What is wrong with you people?!

22:46.093 --> 22:48.160
- Excuse me?
- Our financial advisor

22:48.195 --> 22:50.028
just informed me that despite being

22:50.064 --> 22:53.398
my mother's primary beneficiary,
probate cannot proceed

22:53.434 --> 22:55.868
while I'm under investigation
for her murder?!

22:55.903 --> 22:58.170
You're surprised
to find you're a suspect?

22:58.205 --> 22:59.338
Yes!

22:59.373 --> 23:02.207
And not only do I refuse
to answer your questions,

23:02.243 --> 23:05.944
but I am also prepared
to sue unless you remove this

23:05.980 --> 23:08.647
career-harming cloud of suspicion!

23:08.682 --> 23:10.816
Fine. You have the right
to remain silent.

23:10.851 --> 23:12.451
Anything you say can
and will be used against you...

23:12.486 --> 23:14.219
Wait, what?!
You're not going to arrest me!

23:14.255 --> 23:15.954
We aren't? I thought we were!

23:15.990 --> 23:19.191
Your mom was shot to death,
and you don't have an alibi!

23:19.226 --> 23:21.059
No one benefits more
from her death more than you do,

23:21.095 --> 23:22.628
and you're not answering questions!

23:22.663 --> 23:24.563
But... but what if you're wrong?

23:24.598 --> 23:26.398
What if I'm completely innocent?

23:26.433 --> 23:27.933
Then we'll apologize.

23:27.968 --> 23:29.601
We always do that when we're wrong.

23:29.637 --> 23:31.370
We have no other suspects.

23:31.405 --> 23:34.039
<i>Come on. Of course
you have other suspects.</i>

23:34.074 --> 23:37.175
<i>My mother was a vicious,
ruthless machine who destroyed</i>

23:37.211 --> 23:38.911
<i>anything and everything in her path!</i>

23:38.946 --> 23:40.579
So you didn't like her very much?

23:40.614 --> 23:43.649
Oh, I meant...

23:43.684 --> 23:46.285
Yes, yes, yes.

23:46.320 --> 23:47.653
I loved her.

23:47.688 --> 23:52.324
I have so many great memories of, uh...

23:52.359 --> 23:53.992
very personal moments.

23:54.028 --> 23:55.794
We always had Christmas together.

23:55.829 --> 23:57.362
Almost always.

23:57.398 --> 23:58.764
Really often.

23:58.799 --> 24:00.432
And forget that! Craig Curtis

24:00.467 --> 24:02.467
<i>is the one you should be investigating.</i>

24:02.503 --> 24:04.403
<i>He has an entire chain of restaurants</i>

24:04.438 --> 24:05.837
<i>that's up for grabs.</i>

24:05.873 --> 24:07.339
<i>We heard Bonnie was trying to reach</i>

24:07.374 --> 24:08.840
a financial agreement with him.

24:08.876 --> 24:11.576
Bullshit! She was going
to decimate Craig.

24:11.612 --> 24:14.413
Whereas, I am prepared
to reach an immediate,

24:14.448 --> 24:16.982
mutually beneficial agreement
between Tackles

24:17.017 --> 24:19.051
and its wrongfully terminated employees.

24:19.086 --> 24:20.986
<i>And Craig knew that.</i>

24:21.021 --> 24:23.355
- This just got interesting.
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

24:23.390 --> 24:26.491
So you were colluding with Craig
behind your mother's back.

24:26.527 --> 24:28.026
Yes.

24:28.062 --> 24:31.463
No! Wait! Uh, let me step back.

24:31.498 --> 24:34.566
Uh, I need to figure out
the proper way to respond

24:34.601 --> 24:35.734
to that question.

24:35.769 --> 24:37.469
Oh. he's not a great lawyer, is he?

24:37.504 --> 24:40.973
If you mean "not great"
by his intent to walk himself

24:41.008 --> 24:43.175
on to death row, then no, not so great.

24:43.210 --> 24:45.210
<i>Before your mother's murder,</i>

24:45.245 --> 24:48.046
<i>did you imply to Craig
that you'd go easier on him?</i>

24:48.082 --> 24:50.215
You keep trying to make this about me!

24:50.250 --> 24:54.653
Craig Curtis has an empire
my mother was going to destroy!

24:54.688 --> 24:55.854
Utterly!

24:55.889 --> 24:57.356
I believe her goal was to find

24:57.391 --> 24:58.991
a reasonable deal for her clients.

24:59.026 --> 25:01.159
My mother would've
kept those women protesting

25:01.195 --> 25:03.662
outside of Tackles
until Craig went bankrupt.

25:03.697 --> 25:05.964
Right, because nothing
destroys a business faster

25:06.000 --> 25:08.900
than lining up beautiful
young women outside it.

25:08.936 --> 25:12.504
I think we know enough
to warrant a deeper inquiry

25:12.539 --> 25:14.906
into Craig Curtis's life.

25:14.942 --> 25:17.976
Detective Paige? Amy?

25:18.012 --> 25:22.114
The man seems to have a thing
for attractive young women.

25:22.149 --> 25:23.215
Mm.

25:23.250 --> 25:25.617
Well, we're do our best,
but we're over 30.

25:25.652 --> 25:29.221
Well, no one would ever know.
Police work keeps you young.

25:29.256 --> 25:30.522
Look at my wife.

25:30.557 --> 25:33.058
<i>Curtis knew that I was his only way out.</i>

25:33.093 --> 25:35.060
Okay. And this settlement

25:35.095 --> 25:37.863
that you want to make,
your clients signed off?

25:37.898 --> 25:40.465
Well, there's one girl
who might be a hold-out.

25:40.501 --> 25:43.869
But we can always drop her from the deal.

25:46.340 --> 25:47.939
Do you recognize this call log

25:47.975 --> 25:50.342
and all the hieroglyphics
beside each number?

25:50.377 --> 25:52.010
- Of course.
- All right, then.

25:52.046 --> 25:53.345
If you are really so innocent,

25:53.380 --> 25:55.313
you'll decipher these codes for us.

25:55.349 --> 25:58.116
Starting from the top,
working your way down.

25:58.152 --> 26:00.959
We need to know everything.

26:03.857 --> 26:06.124
Well, I guess you guys
are having trouble figuring out

26:06.160 --> 26:08.126
which of the hundreds
of people Bonnie Pearl

26:08.162 --> 26:10.495
pissed off was willing to
go the distance, huh?

26:10.886 --> 26:13.098
You got to admire her, though.
Tough lady.

26:13.133 --> 26:14.666
She was, Mr. Curtis.

26:14.701 --> 26:16.568
Though it's surprising
you seem to like her,

26:16.603 --> 26:18.437
considering she was
threatening your livelihood.

26:18.472 --> 26:21.606
And referred to you on multiple
occasions as a "sexist pig."

26:21.642 --> 26:22.941
It was the game.

26:22.976 --> 26:25.110
She would say something, I would respond.

26:25.145 --> 26:27.479
I mean, it was all about publicity.

26:27.514 --> 26:28.780
For both of us.

26:28.816 --> 26:31.483
Look, every time Bonnie
trotted out those girls...

26:31.518 --> 26:34.553
and they're still hot... I bet
every guy watching thought,

26:34.588 --> 26:36.321
<i>"If those are the girls
that Tackles fires,</i>

26:36.356 --> 26:38.557
<i>can you imagine the girls
that they keep?"</i>

26:38.592 --> 26:40.158
Wow.

26:40.194 --> 26:41.993
<i>I mean, I even made
sure she knew my schedule...</i>

26:42.029 --> 26:43.462
Craig Curtis.

26:43.497 --> 26:45.764
Man, what a career he was
supposed to have.

26:45.799 --> 26:47.065
Yeah. We don't grill a guy who made

26:47.101 --> 26:49.534
two Super Bowl touchdowns every day.

26:49.570 --> 26:52.070
...guys who thought
it was their job to hurt me.

26:52.106 --> 26:53.805
But you weren't concerned
about the impact

26:53.841 --> 26:57.476
that her protests might have on
your restaurant chain, Tackles,

26:57.511 --> 26:58.710
and your reputation?

26:58.745 --> 27:00.312
Just the opposite.

27:00.347 --> 27:03.548
Look, our newest location is
opening up in Hollywood tonight.

27:03.584 --> 27:05.917
Ladies, consider yourselves invited,

27:05.953 --> 27:08.386
And I am counting on

27:08.422 --> 27:10.956
a big, noisy protest
to drum up publicity.

27:11.572 --> 27:15.594
And as for when Bonnie and those
other rejects call me sexist,

27:15.629 --> 27:19.164
I laugh... because nobody
appreciates women

27:19.199 --> 27:21.333
more than I do. And my customers.

27:21.368 --> 27:23.368
- Hm.
- So the culture you promote...

27:23.403 --> 27:25.804
the outfits and the physical flirting...

27:25.839 --> 27:29.241
Hey, if men wanted to be
served beer by little old ladies

27:29.276 --> 27:31.877
covered head to toe in burlap,
I'd give 'em that.

27:31.912 --> 27:33.378
They don't.

27:33.413 --> 27:35.514
Everybody gets this,
including my investors...

27:35.549 --> 27:37.115
who, by the way,
happen to be some of America's

27:37.151 --> 27:39.050
most influential citizens.

27:39.086 --> 27:41.286
<i>Rick Fox partnered up with me.</i>

27:41.321 --> 27:43.054
<i>He'll be signing books tonight.</i>

27:43.090 --> 27:44.089
<i>We are not a porn team.</i>

27:44.124 --> 27:45.657
Chief. Commander.

27:45.692 --> 27:48.693
I've been decoding
the call logs with Mini-Pearl,

27:48.729 --> 27:50.262
and something jumped out.

27:50.297 --> 27:51.930
For the past month,
there have been dozens

27:51.965 --> 27:54.366
of incoming calls
about Tackles designated

27:54.401 --> 27:56.368
by the cities "Burbank/Dallas SA"

27:56.403 --> 27:58.503
with no phone numbers listed.

27:58.539 --> 28:01.406
- Burbank? Dallas?
- How does Stan Pearl

28:01.441 --> 28:02.440
explain that?

28:02.476 --> 28:04.643
Well, he's not sure, but he thinks it's

28:04.678 --> 28:06.311
a whistle-blower who worked at Tackles

28:06.346 --> 28:07.712
in either Burbank or Dallas.

28:07.748 --> 28:11.216
And the "SA" probably means
"Settlement Agreement."

28:11.251 --> 28:13.418
But I can't find an employee
from both places.

28:13.453 --> 28:15.168
<i>Bill Landon... self-help guide to
millions...</i>

28:15.203 --> 28:18.323
Whoa. Did he just say Bill Landon
was one of his investors?

28:18.358 --> 28:19.624
<i>He'll be there tonight, too!</i>

28:19.660 --> 28:21.326
<i>Bill has a sizable financial stake.</i>

28:21.361 --> 28:24.563
The Landon Method has tons
of fans on "Badge of Justice."

28:24.598 --> 28:26.231
You work on "Badge of Justice"?

28:26.266 --> 28:29.601
Well, yeah, I, uh, consult
and I write for them a little.

28:29.636 --> 28:30.635
You watch?

28:30.671 --> 28:32.871
No, but my mother loves that show.

28:32.906 --> 28:34.673
Would she like to visit the set?

28:34.708 --> 28:36.208
Do you mind, Michael?

28:36.243 --> 28:37.576
Some of us are trying
to solve a murder here.

28:37.611 --> 28:39.211
<i>Bonnie wouldn't bother suing me</i>

28:39.246 --> 28:40.412
<i>if she didn't know that my restaurants</i>

28:40.447 --> 28:41.846
<i>were super successful.</i>

28:41.882 --> 28:44.182
<i>You claim to hire women as "models,"</i>

28:44.218 --> 28:47.919
but your W-2 forms
list them as "servers."

28:47.955 --> 28:49.588
A clerical error.

28:49.623 --> 28:52.424
Look, I cannot imagine being questioned

28:52.459 --> 28:54.492
by two more lovely ladies,
but can you tell me

28:54.528 --> 28:56.494
why you are wasting your time with me

28:56.530 --> 28:58.997
when Bonnie's ex-husband
is such an obvious suspect?

28:59.032 --> 29:01.299
We've been looking for him.
How do you know Jerry Pearl?

29:01.335 --> 29:02.834
Because he spends
a lot of time at Tackles.

29:02.869 --> 29:04.269
As my guest,

29:04.304 --> 29:06.838
<i>always complaining
about how he despises...</i>

29:06.873 --> 29:08.340
<i>despised his ex-wife.</i>

29:08.375 --> 29:09.741
<i>Okay, I'm not gonna lie.</i>

29:09.776 --> 29:11.309
<i>Jerry's a pain in the ass, but, hey,</i>

29:11.345 --> 29:13.778
it was a cheap way to drive Bonnie crazy.

29:13.814 --> 29:15.013
Oh, we're not done here.

29:15.048 --> 29:17.282
- Yeah, we are.
- One second, sir.

29:17.317 --> 29:18.617
You want the LAPD off your back?

29:18.652 --> 29:20.919
Why don't you use that phone and invite

29:20.954 --> 29:22.687
your good friend, Jerry Pearl,

29:22.723 --> 29:25.023
to the opening of your
Hollywood restaurant tonight?

29:25.058 --> 29:26.324
'Cause he's already coming.

29:26.360 --> 29:28.093
<i>See? I'm way ahead of you guys.</i>

29:28.128 --> 29:29.377
<i>Now, if you'll excuse me,</i>

29:29.412 --> 29:30.586
I've got to run.

29:31.498 --> 29:33.832
Well, we know how
we're spending our evening.

29:33.867 --> 29:36.635
You expect me to authorize
overtime so your team

29:36.670 --> 29:39.337
can go to one of these "breastaurants?"

29:39.373 --> 29:40.672
Seriously? Even if we have to

29:40.707 --> 29:42.207
stay there all the way to last call.

29:42.242 --> 29:45.677
Major Crimes takes on
the tough assignments.

29:45.712 --> 29:48.680
Is it just me, or is Craig Curtis'

29:48.715 --> 29:52.984
knowing exactly where
Bonnie's husband is going to be

29:53.020 --> 29:55.444
seen a little convenient?

30:05.679 --> 30:07.011
Hey.

30:08.581 --> 30:11.793
I, uh, didn't expect to see you here.

30:12.652 --> 30:14.319
I, uh...

30:14.354 --> 30:15.753
You want to come up?

30:15.789 --> 30:17.822
I don't know if my new
roommate's home, but...

30:17.857 --> 30:20.658
I'm not... I'm not going inside, okay?

30:20.694 --> 30:22.927
I came to talk to you in-person because

30:22.963 --> 30:26.197
what Aiden did to you
was against the law.

30:26.232 --> 30:28.166
Oh, man.

30:28.201 --> 30:29.300
Listen.

30:29.336 --> 30:31.002
It was my mistake.

30:31.037 --> 30:32.570
If you really want to go over this again,

30:32.605 --> 30:34.372
then don't be mad at Aiden.

30:34.407 --> 30:36.610
- Be mad at me.
- Oh, I am.

30:37.243 --> 30:38.695
What you did...

30:39.946 --> 30:41.579
hurt.

30:41.614 --> 30:44.282
But what Aiden did
was illegal and actionable,

30:44.317 --> 30:45.650
and you should sue.

30:45.685 --> 30:47.585
You... You expect me to stand in court

30:47.620 --> 30:50.088
and tell the whole world
that this guy screwed me,

30:50.123 --> 30:51.625
and then he screwed me?

30:52.425 --> 30:53.865
It's not worth it.

30:53.901 --> 30:56.875
Okay. Well, maybe it
isn't just about you.

30:57.697 --> 30:58.952
I got to go.

31:00.367 --> 31:02.229
Is there anything else
you want to discuss?

31:05.605 --> 31:07.872
Well, were you in love with him?

31:29.963 --> 31:32.096
Say it loud, say it clear!

31:32.132 --> 31:34.032
Dignity's worth more than beer!

31:34.067 --> 31:36.100
Say it loud, say it clear!

31:36.136 --> 31:37.668
Dignity's worth more than beer!

31:37.704 --> 31:39.570
Okay, everyone. Spread out.

31:39.606 --> 31:41.706
Find me inside the moment you have eyes

31:41.741 --> 31:43.975
on Bonnie Pearl's ex-husband.

31:44.010 --> 31:45.977
We are strong! We are bold!

31:46.012 --> 31:48.513
Whenever a woman
has been wrongfully terminated,

31:48.548 --> 31:50.415
Bonnie Pearl is there.

31:50.450 --> 31:55.253
Whenever a woman is being paid
80 cents on a man's dollar,

31:55.288 --> 31:57.455
Bonnie Pearl is there!

31:57.490 --> 31:59.557
And whenever really
hot women are treated like

31:59.592 --> 32:02.994
they're not really hot,
Bonnie Pearl is there, too.

32:03.029 --> 32:05.163
Brin, we're looking for Vanessa.

32:05.198 --> 32:06.464
Sorry, can't help.

32:06.499 --> 32:08.535
Vanessa didn't bother showing up.

32:10.570 --> 32:11.836
- Hey, Mike.
- Hm?

32:11.871 --> 32:13.004
Get a load of this dirtbag.

32:13.039 --> 32:14.572
He's barely old enough to be here.

32:14.607 --> 32:16.407
Wait. I think I recognize him.

32:16.443 --> 32:19.644
Dr. Landon brought his family
to the "Badge of Justice" set.

32:20.338 --> 32:22.814
That's his son, um, Seth.

32:22.849 --> 32:25.249
Wait, wait, wait.
Dr. Landon came to the set

32:25.285 --> 32:26.651
of a television show?

32:26.686 --> 32:28.986
Half our actors
have attended his seminars.

32:29.022 --> 32:32.123
My line producer messengered me

32:32.158 --> 32:34.792
one of Landon's books to
get it autographed

32:34.828 --> 32:37.462
We are bold!
Tackles can't say we're too old!

32:37.497 --> 32:41.766
We are strong! We are bold!
Tackles can't say we're too old!

32:41.801 --> 32:44.035
Craig sold this to my business partners

32:44.070 --> 32:45.903
as a sports bar.

32:45.939 --> 32:47.605
I've never even been in a Tackles before.

32:47.640 --> 32:51.943
This personal appearance
is brought to you by my reps.

32:51.978 --> 32:54.979
Gonna be having a little talk
with them later.

32:55.014 --> 32:57.548
Also with my date,
who I brought with me...

32:57.584 --> 32:59.250
who was just over there.

32:59.285 --> 33:00.685
Where did she go?

33:00.720 --> 33:02.220
Rick?

33:02.255 --> 33:03.921
Rick Fox?

33:03.957 --> 33:05.089
Hey!

33:05.125 --> 33:07.758
Hey, uh, would...

33:07.794 --> 33:10.895
Would you mind signing
one of these for my wife?

33:10.930 --> 33:15.133
I mean, she loves the Lakers.

33:15.168 --> 33:16.734
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

33:16.769 --> 33:19.670
- What's her name?
- Uh, Louie.

33:19.706 --> 33:22.807
Uh, it's short for Louise.

33:22.842 --> 33:24.375
Louie, okay.

33:24.410 --> 33:27.445
It's printed on
recycled paper and every dollar

33:27.480 --> 33:29.881
goes to our foundation's
no-kill shelters.

33:29.916 --> 33:32.150
Dr. Landon? I'm a long-time follower.

33:32.185 --> 33:34.585
Would you mind signing
this to Ronnie O'Hara?

33:34.621 --> 33:36.654
I love a dog-eared copy.

33:36.689 --> 33:38.189
It means you're doing the hard work.

33:38.224 --> 33:39.657
Good for you, Ronnie.

33:39.692 --> 33:41.859
So your last name's O'Hara?

33:41.895 --> 33:45.129
Uh, O-apostrophe-capital-H.

33:45.165 --> 33:46.430
All right.

33:46.466 --> 33:47.899
How do you know Craig Curtis, sir?

33:47.934 --> 33:50.201
Well, uh, after he was
injured, put on the bench

33:50.236 --> 33:52.103
for life, Craig came
to one of my seminars.

33:52.138 --> 33:54.384
There you go, Ronnie.
My family may not totally agree

33:54.419 --> 33:56.107
with how he applied the Landon method,

33:56.142 --> 33:58.676
but, uh, we are proud of his work ethic

33:58.711 --> 34:00.021
and his persistence.

34:01.181 --> 34:02.980
Take care, Ronnie.

34:07.253 --> 34:08.252
Jerry Pearl?

34:08.288 --> 34:09.239
Yeah?

34:10.889 --> 34:12.156
What?

34:12.192 --> 34:13.827
Who are you?

34:20.733 --> 34:22.600
Well, I'm glad
we're not cutting into your

34:22.635 --> 34:24.601
period of mourning, Mr. Pearl.

34:25.938 --> 34:27.672
Is that a reference to Bonnie's death?

34:27.706 --> 34:30.041
Because I am in pieces
over what happened to her.

34:30.076 --> 34:31.943
And you're putting those
pieces back together

34:31.978 --> 34:33.911
by attending the opening of a restaurant

34:33.947 --> 34:36.280
populated by half-naked women?

34:36.315 --> 34:38.114
Is that it?

34:38.150 --> 34:40.150
Everybody mourns in their own way.

34:40.186 --> 34:41.819
Have a seat.

34:41.853 --> 34:44.322
Mr. Pearl, are you going
to deny there were

34:44.357 --> 34:47.569
serious issues between
you and your ex-wife?

34:49.262 --> 34:51.495
Uh, the divorce.

34:51.531 --> 34:53.283
Okay, look.

34:53.733 --> 34:56.000
Did I make mistakes as a husband? Sure.

34:56.034 --> 34:58.369
Could I have been more
attentive? Absolutely.

34:58.404 --> 35:00.338
Should I have slept with
so many of her friends?

35:00.373 --> 35:01.539
Probably not.

35:01.574 --> 35:03.874
Bottom line, I treated her like crap.

35:03.910 --> 35:05.610
I took her for granted.

35:05.645 --> 35:06.978
And she left me.

35:07.013 --> 35:09.447
And yet, you fought for half her assets.

35:09.482 --> 35:12.984
Hey, we may not
have had a fairy-tale romance,

35:13.019 --> 35:16.520
but, you know, for 30 years,
we were partners.

35:16.556 --> 35:18.422
Craig Curtis said that you told him

35:18.458 --> 35:20.625
you despised your ex-wife.

35:20.660 --> 35:21.926
What else was I gonna say?

35:21.961 --> 35:24.228
The guy gave me unlimited free booze

35:24.264 --> 35:27.164
and introduced me
to all the lovely young girls

35:27.200 --> 35:28.299
who work here.

35:28.334 --> 35:31.402
Even the older, over-the-hill ones, too.

35:31.437 --> 35:34.138
And forget them. My ex-wife
and I were still very close.

35:34.173 --> 35:36.073
Even... even Stan doesn't know this,

35:36.109 --> 35:38.709
but after our divorce,
my sex life with Bonnie

35:38.745 --> 35:39.910
actually improved.

35:39.946 --> 35:42.146
In fact, when I heard the news,

35:42.181 --> 35:44.682
you know the very first thing
that came through my mind?

35:44.717 --> 35:48.085
There goes my next 10 years
of spousal support.

35:48.121 --> 35:50.187
You know the second thing
that came through my mind?

35:50.223 --> 35:53.457
The killer had to be
that crazy director guy.

35:53.493 --> 35:55.493
Erik Walsh. Total loon.

35:55.528 --> 35:57.194
It was maybe, what, two weeks ago

35:57.230 --> 35:59.530
and Bonnie and I were... at her place.

35:59.565 --> 36:04.502
And, despite a restraining
order, this guy shows up again!

36:04.537 --> 36:05.903
For the fifth time!

36:05.938 --> 36:08.406
The last report we have
of Mr. Walsh being

36:08.441 --> 36:11.208
at your ex-wife's house
was more than six months ago.

36:11.244 --> 36:14.512
That's because Bonnie
started feeling sorry for him.

36:14.547 --> 36:17.448
I mean, the guy shows up,
he's ranting about his wife,

36:17.483 --> 36:18.883
left him, you know.

36:18.918 --> 36:20.918
I mean, I thought he had
a gun so I got rid of him.

36:21.621 --> 36:24.499
But Bonnie, she refused to call it in,

36:25.191 --> 36:26.123
and here we are.

36:26.159 --> 36:28.225
Yes, Mr. Pearl, here we are.

36:36.703 --> 36:38.536
Wait, are all
the women here assigned names

36:38.571 --> 36:39.837
of different places?

36:39.872 --> 36:42.340
Not just places, Tao. Football cities.

36:47.146 --> 36:49.680
Pardon me, um, you must be Dallas?

36:49.716 --> 36:51.716
Oh, that's right, honey.

36:51.751 --> 36:53.484
I'm the Dallas in Hollywood.

36:53.519 --> 36:55.353
And you are?

36:55.388 --> 36:57.822
LAPD in Tackles.

36:57.857 --> 36:59.690
And I have a few questions
I want to ask you.

36:59.726 --> 37:02.927
But before that, do you have any idea

37:02.962 --> 37:04.762
if there was a Dallas
at the Burbank restaurant?

37:04.797 --> 37:06.430
Oh, sure. She's new, though.

37:06.466 --> 37:09.066
The old Dallas in Burbank is suing us.

37:09.102 --> 37:12.136
I think her name
was Vanessa or something.

37:15.842 --> 37:17.969
Excuse me.

37:20.680 --> 37:21.812
Commander, I'm sorry to interrupt,

37:21.848 --> 37:23.080
but I thought you should know this.

37:23.116 --> 37:25.015
I think we found our Burbank/Dallas SA.

37:25.051 --> 37:27.284
And her name is Vanessa.

37:46.681 --> 37:48.547
Hey!

37:48.582 --> 37:50.015
Rusty, right?

37:51.519 --> 37:52.885
So dressed up!

37:52.920 --> 37:54.720
You're off to your first communion?

37:54.755 --> 37:56.522
Yeah, it's, uh,

37:56.557 --> 37:58.691
nice to see you again, too, Aiden.

37:58.726 --> 38:01.694
Is there someplace private we could talk?

38:01.729 --> 38:03.729
Right here works for me.

38:03.764 --> 38:05.564
And, uh, if you wanted
to thank me for sending

38:05.599 --> 38:06.899
Gus back to you...

38:06.934 --> 38:08.901
Don't even act like
that's what you wanted.

38:08.936 --> 38:11.937
Gus dumped you, not the other way around.

38:11.973 --> 38:13.608
Yeah.

38:14.442 --> 38:15.708
Okay.

38:15.743 --> 38:17.676
I lost out to you.

38:17.712 --> 38:19.511
Is that what you wanted to hear?

38:19.547 --> 38:21.046
We even now?

38:21.082 --> 38:24.369
Because, believe me, there's
plenty more where Gus came from.

38:25.453 --> 38:26.913
Satisfied?

38:27.855 --> 38:29.107
Not quite.

38:30.358 --> 38:33.092
What you're gonna read there
is a summary I put together

38:33.127 --> 38:36.028
of Gus' severance package
along with a glowing reference

38:36.063 --> 38:37.096
that you're going to sign.

38:37.131 --> 38:38.530
I would have asked you
to write it yourself,

38:38.566 --> 38:40.132
but I'd rather not stay that long.

38:40.167 --> 38:42.334
Gus wasn't up to the job.

38:42.370 --> 38:46.538
Why would I give him severance
pay or a recommendation?

38:46.574 --> 38:48.040
Because if you don't,
then I'm going to make sure

38:48.075 --> 38:50.209
you're taken to court
for sexual harassment.

38:50.244 --> 38:51.243
Ha!

38:51.278 --> 38:52.778
Sexual harassment?

38:52.813 --> 38:55.047
Look, I know you
don't want to believe this,

38:55.082 --> 38:57.016
but Gus was more than willing.

38:57.051 --> 38:58.217
Until he wasn't.

38:58.252 --> 39:00.019
Which is when you fired him.

39:00.054 --> 39:03.122
And you've said it, Aiden, there
is more where Gus came from.

39:03.157 --> 39:05.224
Were there more before Gus, too?

39:05.259 --> 39:07.626
Or was he the very first
employee that you

39:07.661 --> 39:10.763
treated to promotions
all the way to your bedroom?

39:10.798 --> 39:13.699
Because one well-publicized
court proceeding could

39:13.734 --> 39:16.296
end up being just
the beginning of your troubles.

39:17.071 --> 39:21.540
If I leave here today
without your signature

39:21.575 --> 39:25.577
and a check covering
two months of Gus' pay,

39:25.613 --> 39:28.981
you have no idea how ugly
this is going to get.

39:31.552 --> 39:33.552
Or maybe you do.

39:36.824 --> 39:39.319
All right, Miss Burbank/Dallas.

39:40.561 --> 39:42.280
Let's return her glasses.

39:50.438 --> 39:51.770
I just had an idea.

39:51.806 --> 39:53.672
Assuming we're done here
at a reasonable hour,

39:53.707 --> 39:55.040
how about grabbing a drink?

39:55.076 --> 39:57.176
Let me guess. You struck out with Denver,

39:57.211 --> 39:59.011
Miami, and Houston, so you decided

39:59.046 --> 40:02.281
to take a swing at Highland Park?

40:02.316 --> 40:05.784
Or maybe everything I was searching for

40:05.820 --> 40:07.786
was right here on my doorstep all along.

40:07.822 --> 40:09.788
After everyone else turned you down!

40:09.824 --> 40:12.791
I love being someone's 48th choice.

40:12.827 --> 40:14.693
You knock on doors until one opens.

40:20.468 --> 40:21.945
Safety check?

40:36.050 --> 40:37.460
Vanessa?

40:39.353 --> 40:40.586
Vanessa?

40:40.621 --> 40:42.173
Are you here?

40:55.169 --> 40:56.568
Vanessa?

40:59.155 --> 41:00.358
Aw, man.

41:02.643 --> 41:04.153
Oh, man.

41:06.547 --> 41:08.213
Man.

41:17.958 --> 41:19.825
C'mon, C'mon, C'mon, C'mon

41:20.305 --> 41:26.825
