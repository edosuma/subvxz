WEBVTT

00:02.100 --> 00:04.989
*

00:05.570 --> 00:07.959
- ALL RIGHT, SHAWN,
NOW, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

00:08.000 --> 00:10.867
ABOUT PLAYING SECOND BASE
IS THE FOOTWORK.

00:10.910 --> 00:13.003
YOU READY?
- I WAS BORN READY, DAD.

00:13.040 --> 00:14.439
- ACTUALLY,
YOU WERE BORN BREECH, SON.

00:14.480 --> 00:16.869
TOOK HOURS TO GET YOU OUT.
BALL.

00:16.910 --> 00:19.413
BUT I APPRECIATE
THE ENTHUSIASM.

00:19.450 --> 00:20.917
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GIVE IT A TRY.

00:20.950 --> 00:22.019
HERE WE GO.
GET THOSE FEET GOING.

00:22.050 --> 00:23.517
COME ON, GET LOW.
GET LOW.

00:23.550 --> 00:24.881
ATI'ABOY.

00:26.090 --> 00:28.354
THAT'S IT.

00:29.290 --> 00:31.554
WOW!
WHOA, THAT WAS GREAT.

00:31.590 --> 00:33.319
- WELL, I JUST DID
WHAT YOU SAID.

00:33.360 --> 00:34.827
- THAT WAS PERFECT, SON.

00:34.860 --> 00:36.020
- HIT ME ANOTHER ONE, DAD.

00:36.070 --> 00:37.560
- YOU GOT IT.

00:37.600 --> 00:40.569
OH, THIS TIME WE'RE GONNA TRY
A FEW NEW THINGS.

00:40.600 --> 00:42.465
STAY LOW, JUST LIKE YOU DID.
THAT WAS GOOD.

00:42.510 --> 00:43.568
THIS TIME TAKE YOUR LEFI' FOOT,

00:43.610 --> 00:44.702
YOU'RE GONNA POINT IT
TOWARD THE BAG.

00:44.740 --> 00:45.900
KEEP YOUR RIGHT FOOT
FIRMLY PLANTED

00:45.940 --> 00:47.009
IN THE GROUND.

00:47.040 --> 00:48.405
YOU'RE GONNA AIM FOR
THE LOWER PART

00:48.440 --> 00:49.577
OF THE FIRST BASEMAN'S GLOVE

00:49.610 --> 00:50.872
WHILE CALIBRATING
THE NUMBER OF STEPS

00:50.910 --> 00:52.343
BEFORE THE RUNNER GETS THERE.

00:52.380 --> 00:54.712
GOT IT?
- I THINK SO.

00:54.750 --> 00:57.310
- ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.
GET LOW.

01:02.060 --> 01:04.187
AH!

01:17.040 --> 01:20.009
- BIG WIN TODAY.
BIG WIN.

01:20.040 --> 01:22.076
BIG WIN FOR THE TEAM.

01:22.110 --> 01:23.077
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, BUZZ?
- YEP.

01:23.110 --> 01:24.998
- WELL PLAYED, ALL OF YOU.

01:25.050 --> 01:27.018
LET US NOT FORGET
THAT OUR VALIANT OPPONENTS

01:27.050 --> 01:30.019
ALSO PLAYED
A HECK OF A BALLGAME.

01:30.050 --> 01:32.257
RESPECT, HAIRCUT HUT.

01:32.290 --> 01:34.758
- CHEERS!
- GOOD GAME.

01:34.790 --> 01:36.326
- CHEERS!

01:36.360 --> 01:38.783
- I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE GIVING
THAT VICTORY SPEECH, SHAWN.

01:38.830 --> 01:40.127
YOU ALMOST COST US
THE GAME TODAY.

01:40.160 --> 01:41.525
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I HAD FIVE HITS.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.528
- YOU ALSO OVERTHREW
FIRST BASE FIVE TIMES.

01:43.570 --> 01:45.822
- [sighs]
- MM-HMM.

01:45.870 --> 01:47.132
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

01:47.170 --> 01:48.762
I KNOW YOU'RE ALL THINKING IT,
SO HERE IT GOES.

01:48.800 --> 01:51.109
I AM SUFFERING FROM
A MENTAL BLOCK.

01:51.140 --> 01:52.903
IT GOES ALL THE WAY BACK
TO MY YOUTH.

01:52.940 --> 01:55.374
IT'S VERY COMMON AMONGST
HIGHLY SKILLED ATHLETES

01:55.410 --> 01:58.573
AND INTERNATIONAL MEN
OF LEISURE.

01:58.610 --> 02:00.077
THEY CALL IT THE "YIPS."

02:00.120 --> 02:01.417
- THEY SHOULD CALL IT
THE "SUCKS."

02:01.450 --> 02:02.644
[laughter]

02:03.690 --> 02:05.715
- WAIT, WASN'T THERE
THAT GUY--WHAT'S HIS NAME?

02:05.750 --> 02:08.787
- YES. FORMER YANKEE
SECOND BASEMAN CHUCK KNOBLAUCH.

02:08.820 --> 02:11.880
ALL OF A SUDDEN HE COMMI'I'I'ED
AN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER

02:11.930 --> 02:12.897
OF TH ROWING ERRORS,

02:12.930 --> 02:15.091
ONE OF WHICH SAILED
INTO THE STANDS

02:15.130 --> 02:16.825
AND HIT KEITH OLBERMANN'S MOTHER
IN THE FACE.

02:16.870 --> 02:18.098
- THAT'S AWFUL.

02:18.130 --> 02:19.461
- DON'T WORRY, JULES,
I'M GETTING HELP.

02:19.500 --> 02:22.628
I JUST RECENTLY STARTED SEEING
A SPORTS PSYCHOLOGIST,

02:22.670 --> 02:24.331
AND I'M HAPPY TO REPORT

02:24.370 --> 02:26.804
THAT I'M ALREADY SEEING
MARKED IMPROVEMENT.

02:26.840 --> 02:28.171
- FIVE ERRORS IS AN IMPROVEMENT?

02:28.210 --> 02:29.245
- COULD HAVE BEEN TEN, GUS.

02:29.280 --> 02:31.009
- HERE YOU GO, SIR.
- THANK YOU.

02:35.950 --> 02:37.986
- WHERE'S MY FOOD?

02:38.020 --> 02:39.908
EXCUSE ME,
I STILL HAVEN'T GOTI'EN

02:39.960 --> 02:41.518
MY PIZZA CHILI CHEESE FRIES--

02:41.560 --> 02:43.118
ALSO KNOWN AS
THE SHAWN SPENCER.

02:43.160 --> 02:44.559
NOT THAT YOU'D
RECOGNIZE THEM AS SUCH,

02:44.590 --> 02:47.024
SEEING AS HOW THIS ESTABLISHMENT
REFUSES TO CALL THEM THAT,

02:47.060 --> 02:49.426
EVEN THOUGH I ORDER THEM
SIX TIMES A WEEK.

02:49.470 --> 02:51.597
- I BROUGHT YOU THE FRIES, SIR.

02:51.630 --> 02:54.190
- IF YOU'D BROUGHT THEM TO ME,
I THINK I'D KNOW

02:54.240 --> 02:57.209
'CAUSE I'D BE EXPERIENCING BOTH
EUPHORIA AND A BURNING SENSATION

02:57.240 --> 02:59.037
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
OF MY COLON.

02:59.070 --> 03:00.708
- DO YOU WANT TO SPEAK
TO MY MANAGER?

03:00.740 --> 03:03.174
- I DON'T WANT TO,
I DEMAND TO, JENNY.

03:03.210 --> 03:05.644
WE WILL DISCUSS
BOTH THE NAME OF THE DISH

03:05.680 --> 03:07.375
AND THE METHOD IN WHICH
IT IS EXPEDITED.

03:07.420 --> 03:10.048
THIS GUY BEHIND--
OKAY.

03:10.090 --> 03:14.208
[clears throat]
EXCUSE ME, I'M AFRAID WE HAVE--

03:14.260 --> 03:16.979
[register rings]

03:17.030 --> 03:18.918
- CAN I HELP YOU
WITH ANYTHING?

03:21.100 --> 03:23.591
- HOLD THAT THOUGHT.

03:25.030 --> 03:26.839
- SORRY.

03:26.870 --> 03:28.758
LASSIE, WE MAY HAVE A REAL
SORT OF SERIOUS PROBLEM.

03:28.800 --> 03:30.131
- GUYS, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE.

03:30.170 --> 03:33.708
- OH, COME ON.
YOU DIDN'T THINK WE'D FORGET.

03:33.740 --> 03:39.610
- * HAAAA-PY BIRTHDAY TO YOU

03:39.650 --> 03:41.242
- UPGRADE THAT
TO AN EMERGENCY.

03:41.280 --> 03:46.912
- * HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU,
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DEAR... *

03:46.960 --> 03:50.282
- THAT GUY BY THE DOOR
HAS A GUN.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.653
WE NEED TO MAKE A PLAN.

03:53.700 --> 03:54.951
THERE'S A LOUISVILLE SLUGGER
ON THE WALL.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.797
I'M GONNA CRACK THE GLASS,
USE IT.

03:56.830 --> 03:57.990
SOME OF US AREN'T PACKING.

03:58.030 --> 03:59.998
- MOVE.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.964
POLICE!
FREEZE, DOUCHE BAG!

04:03.010 --> 04:04.966
[gunshots]

04:05.010 --> 04:07.831
[screaming]

04:07.880 --> 04:11.668
[gunshots]

04:13.720 --> 04:14.948
- OKAY, WHAT HAVE WE GOT?

04:14.980 --> 04:17.289
- WHAT WE'VE GOT IS
A WHITE MALE,

04:17.320 --> 04:19.185
MEDIUM BUILD,
ABOUT 5'10".

04:19.220 --> 04:20.585
ATTEMPTED ARMED ROBBERY.

04:20.620 --> 04:23.350
A FEW SHOTS EXCHANGED
BETWEEN THE PERP AND MYSELF

04:23.390 --> 04:25.881
BEFORE HE ESCAPED
OUT THESE DOORS HERE.

04:25.930 --> 04:27.750
- LOOKS LIKE MORE
THAN A FEW.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.597
- I WAS ROUNDING.

04:29.630 --> 04:31.564
- O'HARA, EXPAND
THE PERIMETER SEARCH.

04:31.600 --> 04:34.296
I WANT THIS BASTARD FOUND.

04:35.300 --> 04:37.268
- THANK YOU, CHIEF.
I'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE.

04:37.310 --> 04:39.505
ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE,
WE ALL WENT THROUGH

04:39.540 --> 04:41.178
A TERRIBLE ORDEAL TODAY.

04:41.210 --> 04:43.940
NOT ONLY WERE WE
ALMOST KILLED, CHIEF,

04:43.980 --> 04:46.471
I NEVER GOT MY PIZZA
CHILI CHEESE FRIES.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.044
- BUT SE'ITING THAT ASIDE
FOR A SECOND...

04:48.080 --> 04:49.308
- MR. SPENCER,
UNLESS YOU HAVE SOMETHING

04:49.350 --> 04:51.284
THAT WILL HELP
THIS INVESTIGATION,

04:51.320 --> 04:53.254
I SUGGEST YOU SHUT
THE HELL UP.

04:58.330 --> 05:01.356
- I THINK I DO
HAVE SOMETHING, CHIEF.

05:01.400 --> 05:02.822
I'M GETTING SOME
SERIOUS VOODOO

05:02.870 --> 05:04.758
THAT THE HOODED MAN DIDN'T
COME IN HERE

05:04.800 --> 05:05.892
TO ROB THE RESTAURANT.

05:05.930 --> 05:07.295
- THEN WHAT WAS HE DOING?

05:07.340 --> 05:09.661
- HE WANTED TO KILL SOMEONE.

05:09.710 --> 05:12.065
- WANTED TO KILL SOMEONE?
WHO?

05:12.110 --> 05:14.408
- ONE OF US.

05:19.250 --> 05:22.788
[Friendly Indians'
I Know You Know]

05:22.820 --> 05:26.210
*

05:26.250 --> 05:27.558
- * IN BETWEEN THE LINES

05:27.590 --> 05:29.956
* THERE'S A LOT
OF OBSCURITY *

05:29.990 --> 05:33.528
* I'M NOT INCLINED
TO RESIGN TO MATURITY *

05:33.560 --> 05:36.791
* IF IT'S ALL RIGHT
THEN YOU'RE ALL WRONG *

05:36.830 --> 05:40.266
* BUT WHY BOUNCE AROUND
TO THE SAME DAMN SONG? *

05:40.300 --> 05:45.636
* YOU'D RATHER RUN
WHEN YOU CAN'T CRAWL *

05:47.740 --> 05:49.378
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

05:49.410 --> 05:51.344
* THAT I'M NOT TELLING
THE TRUTH *

05:51.380 --> 05:52.938
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

05:52.980 --> 05:54.709
* THEY JUST DON'T HAVE
ANY PROOF *

05:54.750 --> 05:57.810
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION
LEARN HOW TO BEND *

05:57.850 --> 05:59.317
* YOUR WORST INHIBITIONS

05:59.350 --> 06:01.989
* TEND TO PSYCH YOU OUT
IN THE END *

06:02.020 --> 06:04.682
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

06:10.230 --> 06:12.061
- I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS, SPENCER.

06:12.100 --> 06:14.159
- FACT: THE HOODED GUY
CAME INTO THE RESTAURANT

06:14.200 --> 06:15.667
TO KILL SOMEONE
AT OUR TABLE.

06:15.700 --> 06:18.066
FACT: HE FAILED, WHICH MEANS
HE'LL PROBABLY TRY AGAIN.

06:18.110 --> 06:20.476
FACT: IF I CAN FIGURE OUT
WHO HE WAS TARGETING,

06:20.510 --> 06:22.944
IT'LL PROBABLY GIVE US INSIGHT
AS TO THE HOODED MAN'S IDENTITY.

06:22.980 --> 06:24.140
- SHAWN, THOSE AREN'T FACTS.

06:24.180 --> 06:25.738
AT BEST THEY'RE
A STAB IN THE DARK.

06:25.780 --> 06:27.509
- A STAB IN THE DARK?

06:27.550 --> 06:29.142
FACT: THAT'S A PRE'ITY GOOD NAME
FOR A HORROR FLICK.

06:29.180 --> 06:30.442
GUS, REMIND ME TO INCLUDE IT
IN THIS YEAR'S HOLIDAY LE'I'I'ER

06:30.490 --> 06:31.946
TO WES CRAVEN.

06:31.990 --> 06:34.049
- I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU WRITE
THOSE--HE NEVER RECIPROCATES.

06:34.090 --> 06:35.955
- MAYBE HE ISN'T RECIPROCATING
AGAINST HIS WILL.

06:35.990 --> 06:37.958
- THAT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE, SHAWN.

06:37.990 --> 06:39.389
- HERE ARE THE STATEMENTS FROM
EVERYONE THAT WAS IN THE BAR.

06:39.430 --> 06:41.523
- GREAT.
I'LL LOOK AT THEM.

06:41.560 --> 06:43.528
- YOUR HYPOTHESIS IS CRAP.

06:43.570 --> 06:44.491
WHO WALKS INTO
A KNOWN COP BAR TO KILL A COP?

06:44.530 --> 06:46.088
IT MAKES NO SENSE.
- FACT--

06:46.130 --> 06:47.836
- YOU SAY THAT WORD AGAIN,
I'LL PUNCH YOU IN THE FACE.

06:47.870 --> 06:50.964
- TRUTH: THERE WAS ONLY $42
IN THE CASH REGISTER.

06:51.010 --> 06:52.068
- HE'S RIGHT.

06:52.110 --> 06:53.975
THE MANAGER VERIFIES IT
IN HIS STATEMENT.

06:55.280 --> 06:57.248
- WHO WALKS IN
AND TRIES TO KNOCK OFF

06:57.280 --> 06:59.009
A KNOWN COP BAR
FOR $42?

06:59.050 --> 07:00.347
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

07:00.380 --> 07:01.813
- BECAUSE HE'S A LOWLIFE
WHACKED OUT ON JUNK.

07:01.850 --> 07:03.283
I'VE SEEN IT MANY,
MANY TIMES.

07:03.320 --> 07:05.515
- SHAWN.
- DAD.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.017
- OH, SHAWN,
THANK GOD YOU'RE OKAY.

07:07.060 --> 07:08.982
- YEAH, YEAH, I'M FINE.
WHAT'S UP?

07:09.020 --> 07:10.521
- I SAW THE SHOOTING
ON TELEVISION.

07:10.560 --> 07:11.527
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO CALL
YOUR CELL PHONE.

07:11.560 --> 07:13.221
IT'S BEEN GOING
TO VOICE MAIL.

07:13.260 --> 07:15.490
I'VE BEEN WORRIED TO DEATH.

07:15.530 --> 07:18.124
- I FORGOT TO TURN ON
MY PHONE.

07:18.170 --> 07:19.159
- GUS, LET ME ASK YOU
SOMETHING.

07:19.200 --> 07:20.167
WHAT WAS THE VERY FIRST THING
YOU DID

07:20.200 --> 07:21.292
RIGHT AFTER THE SHOOTING?

07:21.340 --> 07:23.160
- I CALLED MY FOLKS
TO TELL THEM I WAS OKAY.

07:23.210 --> 07:24.802
- AND WHAT WAS THE FIRST THING
HE DID?

07:27.710 --> 07:29.075
- I SURE DID.
YOU KNOW WHY?

07:29.110 --> 07:30.304
BECAUSE IT MAKES ME THINK
OF YOU,

07:30.350 --> 07:32.614
'CAUSE YOU'RE MY BIG OL'
PAPA MONKEY.

07:32.650 --> 07:35.710
- I NEED TO SEE EVERYONE
WHO WAS PRESENT AT THE SHOOTING.

07:35.750 --> 07:37.115
- THAT'S US.
GOTTA GO.

07:37.150 --> 07:38.117
THANKS FOR COMING BY, DAD.

07:38.150 --> 07:39.242
- GUS,
AM I OVERREACTING?

07:39.290 --> 07:42.418
- NO.
- WE'RE NOT DONE HERE, SHAWN.

07:42.460 --> 07:45.224
- UH, OKAY,
SINCE YOU WERE INVOLVED

07:45.260 --> 07:47.728
IN AN ARMED ROBBERY ATTEMPT
AND SUBSEQUENT SHOOTING,

07:50.370 --> 07:52.429
TO OFFER COUNSELING
TO ANYONE WHO WANTS IT.

07:54.370 --> 07:55.564
- PBBBT.

07:55.600 --> 08:00.037
- SO...IF NO ONE NEEDS TO SPEAK
WITH DR. ERLICH...

08:00.080 --> 08:02.173
OKAY, LET'S GET BACK TO WORK.

08:02.210 --> 08:03.802
- PBBBT.

08:03.850 --> 08:06.671
[clears throat]
CHIEF?

08:06.720 --> 08:08.176
- EXCUSE ME.

08:08.220 --> 08:10.484
YEAH?
- I, UH...

08:10.520 --> 08:11.942
I DIDN'T WANT TO SHOW WEAKNESS

08:11.990 --> 08:13.252
IN FRONT OF
THE REST OF THE GROUP,

08:13.290 --> 08:16.214
BUT I COULD USE A LITTLE
COUNSELING, TO BE HONEST.

08:16.260 --> 08:19.149
- THERE'S NO SHAME
IN ASKING FOR HELP, MR. SPENCER.

08:19.190 --> 08:20.350
YOU AND DR. ERLICH CAN
USE THE CONFERENCE ROOM.

08:20.400 --> 08:21.628
- RIGHT.

08:21.660 --> 08:24.629
DO I HAVE TO USE
THE DEPARTMENT'S PSYCHOLOGIST?

08:24.670 --> 08:27.434
- OH, WELL, NO,
NOT TECHNICALLY.

08:27.470 --> 08:30.507
- 'CAUSE I'D LIKE TO CALL IN
MY OWN GUY.

08:30.540 --> 08:32.633
- THIS IS
A SPORTS PSYCHOLOGIST.

08:32.680 --> 08:34.705
- YES, I KNOW.
DR. MANNY IS FANTASTIC,

08:34.740 --> 08:36.674
AND HE'S HELPING ME
WITH THE YIPS.

08:36.710 --> 08:39.577
- I'M NOT USING PUBLIC FUNDS
TO HELP YOU

08:39.620 --> 08:41.975
OVERCOME YOUR MENTAL BLOCK
OF OVERTHROWING FIRST BASE.

08:42.020 --> 08:43.942
- WOULD IT HELP IF I TOLD YOU
I'M ALSO PEE-SHY?

08:43.990 --> 08:46.709
- CHIEF?

08:46.760 --> 08:50.787
CSI FOUND THESE IN THE ALLEY
BEHIND THE SPORTS BAR.

08:50.830 --> 08:53.025
- ROOM 16.
THE DOWNTOWNER MOTEL.

08:53.060 --> 08:55.096
- THIS MATCHES
THE SHOOTER'S SWEATSHIRT.

08:55.130 --> 08:57.018
- WHICH HE PROBABLY RIPPED
WHILE ESCAPING,

08:57.070 --> 08:58.492
AND THE KEY FELL OUT.

08:58.530 --> 09:00.168
THERE'S A DAMN GOOD CHANCE
THAT HE'S AT THIS LOCATION.

09:00.200 --> 09:01.531
- I KNOW THIS PLACE.
LET'S GO, O'HARA.

09:01.570 --> 09:02.969
- I'LL DRIVE.
- NO NEED.

09:03.010 --> 09:04.705
I FINALLY GOT MY CAR BACK
FROM THE SHOP. IT'S PERFECT.

09:04.740 --> 09:06.367
I AM GONNA ASK YOU
TO SIT ON A TOWEL, THOUGH.

09:06.410 --> 09:08.401
NO OFFENSE.

09:08.440 --> 09:10.271
- WHY WOULD I BE OFFENDED
BY THAT?

09:16.250 --> 09:18.047
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
WE'RE GONNA FIND HERE.

09:18.090 --> 09:19.148
THE SHOOTER'S
BACK AT THE MOTEL.

09:19.190 --> 09:20.384
- GUS, DON'T BE THE RIBS

09:20.420 --> 09:22.650
THAT FLIP OVER
FRED FLINTSTONE'S CAR.

09:22.690 --> 09:23.725
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT
COMPLETELY SOLD

09:23.760 --> 09:24.988
ON MY HIT MAN THEORY,

09:25.030 --> 09:26.952
BUT I NEED YOU
TO SUSPEND YOUR DISBELIEF

09:27.000 --> 09:29.252
AND HOP ONBOARD THE STREETCAR
NAMED SHAWNSIRE.

09:29.300 --> 09:32.463
- DUDE, YOU KNOW HOW THAT
METAPHOR MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE.

09:35.600 --> 09:37.830
- I KNEW IT.
- WHAT?

09:37.870 --> 09:39.132
- I KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING
ABOUT THAT GUY

09:39.170 --> 09:40.774
THAT DIDN'T SCREAM
"JUNKY THIEF."

09:40.810 --> 09:43.404
HE WAS WEARING
A $5,000 WATCH, GUS.

09:43.450 --> 09:45.179
AND I KNOW HIS SOCKS
WERE 80 BUCKS

09:45.210 --> 09:47.178
'CAUSE I JUST ORDERED SOME
WITH YOUR NORDSTROM'S CARD.

09:47.220 --> 09:49.017
- HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I TOLD YOU
TO STAY OUT OF MY WALLET?

09:49.050 --> 09:51.382
- LIKE YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE HAPPY
WHEN YOU GET THOSE POINTS.

09:56.260 --> 09:57.488
I GOT IT.

09:57.530 --> 09:58.849
- YOU KNOW WHO THE HIT MAN
WAS AFTER?

09:58.890 --> 10:02.189
- NO, I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
TO MY PIZZA CHILI CHEESE FRIES.

10:02.230 --> 10:04.528
THAT DUMPY CATCHER
FROM THE HAIRCUT HUT GOT THEM.

10:04.570 --> 10:06.424
NOW THERE'S A PURPLE-HAIRED
LESBIAN RUNNING AROUND

10:06.470 --> 10:08.734
WITH DYSPEPSIA
THAT SHOULD BE MINE.

10:08.770 --> 10:10.465
- I'LL BE IN THE CAR.

10:11.740 --> 10:14.402
- GUS, FREEZE!
- WHAT?

10:17.310 --> 10:19.369
- UH, EXCUSE ME.

10:19.410 --> 10:20.638
WHERE WOULD I FIND
THE MONITOR

10:20.680 --> 10:23.410
THAT GOES WITH
THAT SURVEILLANCE CAMERA?

10:23.450 --> 10:24.849
UNDER THE HOSTESS STAND.

10:24.890 --> 10:26.414
BUT THE COPS ALREADY TOOK
THE TAPE FROM THE DAY.

10:26.450 --> 10:28.918
- I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN THE TAPE.

10:28.960 --> 10:31.781
- CAN I MOVE NOW?

10:31.830 --> 10:34.390
- YES.

10:34.430 --> 10:36.125
EXACTLY TWO STEPS
TO YOUR RIGHT.

10:47.910 --> 10:50.378
THAT GUY'S A LOT SMARTER
THAN LASSIE GAVE HIM CREDIT FOR.

10:50.410 --> 10:53.709
CHECK IT OUT.
- WHAT?

10:54.820 --> 10:56.640
- HE KNEW EXACTLY
WHERE TO STAND

10:56.690 --> 10:59.545
SO THAT SURVEILLANCE CAMERA
WOULDN'T PICK HIM UP.

10:59.590 --> 11:01.785
- WHY WOULD SOMEONE
SO INTELLIGENT

11:01.820 --> 11:04.550
CARELESSLY DROP
THEIR MOTEL ROOM KEY?

11:06.800 --> 11:08.722
- IT WAS A DUMMY LEAD.

11:08.760 --> 11:11.467
- S.B.P.D.

11:17.240 --> 11:18.468
- JULIET CONFIRMED IT.

11:18.510 --> 11:20.000
THE SHOOTER WASN'T
AT THE MOTEL.

11:20.040 --> 11:22.235
LASSITER STILL THINKS
THIS GUY'S A JUNKY THIEF,

11:22.280 --> 11:23.372
SO HE'S COMBING THE AREA

11:23.410 --> 11:24.877
IN CASE THE PERP SAW THEM
AND TOOK OFF.

11:24.910 --> 11:27.970
- YEAH, I FIGURED I'D NEED MORE
TO CONVINCE LASSIE.

11:28.020 --> 11:30.181
THAT'S WHY I'VE COMPLETELY
RESTAGED THE CRIME SCENE

11:30.220 --> 11:31.847
WITH STAND-INS WHERE
EACH OF US WERE SITTING.

11:31.890 --> 11:34.711
THIS WAY I CAN FIGURE OUT
WHO THE SHOOTER WAS TARGETING.

11:34.760 --> 11:37.729
- ALL RIGHT, LET ME GUESS.
I'M THE PEPPER, YOU'RE THE SALT.

11:37.760 --> 11:39.318
JULIET'S THE SUGAR,
LASSITER'S THE LEMON,

11:39.360 --> 11:42.864
MCNAB'S THE CHERRY--
MASHED POTATOES? REALLY?

11:42.900 --> 11:44.527
- THIS IS ACTUALLY
KIND OF FUN.

11:44.570 --> 11:46.322
DID YOU WANT TO SCOOP OUT
THE LAST LESBIAN?

11:46.370 --> 11:47.689
- JUST TELL ME
WHAT YOU GOT, SHAWN.

11:47.740 --> 11:50.402
- ALL RIGHT, WE KNOW
THAT THE SHOOTER

11:50.440 --> 11:52.977
HELD HIS POSITION AT THE DOOR
FOR EXACTLY 26 SECONDS.

11:53.010 --> 11:54.102
- AND WE KNOW THIS HOW?

11:54.140 --> 11:55.107
- BECAUSE THAT'S
HOW LONG IT TAKES

11:55.140 --> 11:56.949
TO SING HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

11:56.980 --> 11:59.346
* HAPPY BIRTH--
- I GOT THE SINGING, SHAWN.

11:59.380 --> 12:05.387
* HAAAAA-PY BIRTHDAY
TO YOU *

12:05.420 --> 12:06.751
- UPGRADE THAT
TO AN EMERGENCY.

12:06.790 --> 12:11.056
- * HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU

12:11.090 --> 12:18.360
* HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR BUZZ

12:18.400 --> 12:21.858
* HAPPY BIRTHDAY

12:21.900 --> 12:26.667
* TO YOU

12:26.710 --> 12:28.769
- I KNOW WHO HE WAS AFTER.

12:28.810 --> 12:33.816
[cell phone ringing]

12:39.620 --> 12:43.556
[gunshots]

12:43.590 --> 12:47.253
[tires screeching]

12:49.430 --> 12:50.727
[impact]

12:56.040 --> 12:58.065
- SERIOUSLY,
HOW'S LASSIE?

12:58.110 --> 12:59.407
- NOT GOOD.
- OH, MAN.

12:59.440 --> 13:01.772
- YEAH, I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM
THIS BAD.

13:02.910 --> 13:05.549
- THIS SON OF A BITCH
DESTROYED MY CAR.

13:05.580 --> 13:07.468
- CALM DOWN, CARLTON.
AT LEAST YOU'RE OKAY.

13:07.520 --> 13:08.873
- YOU REALLY SHOULD
COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS.

13:08.920 --> 13:10.717
- YEAH, SHAWN'S CALL KEPT YOU
FROM BEING HIT.

13:10.750 --> 13:13.310
- JULES, IT'S NOT IMPORTANT
THAT IT WAS ME

13:13.360 --> 13:15.316
THAT SAVED LASSIE'S LIFE,
OR THAT I WAS RIGHT,

13:15.360 --> 13:16.384
OR THAT HE SHOULD HAVE
LISTENED TO ME FROM THE START

13:16.420 --> 13:17.580
BECAUSE I WAS RIGHT.

13:17.630 --> 13:20.098
THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT
YOU'RE UNHARMED,

13:20.130 --> 13:22.325
AND THAT IT WAS BECAUSE OF ME
AND I WAS RIGHT.

13:22.360 --> 13:23.429
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MUCH THEY'RE GONNA

13:23.470 --> 13:24.528
CHARGE THE CITY TO FIX THIS?

13:24.570 --> 13:25.821
- ARE YOU ASKING SHAWN
THE PSYCHIC,

13:25.870 --> 13:27.690
OR SHAWN THE GUY WHO
WORKED FOR A COUPLE AFTERNOONS

13:27.740 --> 13:28.764
AT A MEINEKE?

13:28.800 --> 13:29.767
- LASSITER,
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

13:29.800 --> 13:30.835
WHO'D WANT TO SHOOT YOU?

13:30.870 --> 13:32.667
- A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT
TO KILL ME.

13:32.710 --> 13:33.802
I TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN THAT.

13:33.840 --> 13:35.728
- SPENCER, ARE YOU GETTING
ANY VIBRATIONS

13:35.780 --> 13:36.735
ON WHO THAT MIGHT BE?

13:36.780 --> 13:39.669
- CHIEF,
THE PSYCHIC UNIVERSE IS

13:39.710 --> 13:41.814
ECHOING LASSIE'S SENTIMENTS.

13:41.850 --> 13:43.283
HE HAS SO MANY ENEMIES,

13:43.320 --> 13:44.981
IT LITERALLY COULD HAVE
BEEN ANYONE.

13:45.020 --> 13:47.056
- HIS LANDLORD. HIS MAILMAN.
- HIS EX-WIFE. BIGFOOT.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.326
- OKAY, BUT THAT ONLY
ELIMINATES BIGFOOT.

13:51.360 --> 13:52.327
BY THE WAY, LITTLE-KNOWN FACT:

13:52.360 --> 13:55.124
BIGFOOT...
HE ONLY WORE A SIZE TEN.

13:55.160 --> 13:56.559
- I NEED BALLISTICS
ON THE SHOOTER'S GUN

13:56.600 --> 13:59.797
AND DETAILS ON ITS VANTAGE POINT
WHEN HE FIRED ON LASSITER.

13:59.830 --> 14:01.161
- ALL RIGHT,
SINCE I'M POINT ON THIS,

14:01.200 --> 14:02.360
O'HARA, YOU PULL
ALL MY OLD CASE FILES,

14:02.400 --> 14:03.367
START GOING OVER THEM.

14:03.410 --> 14:04.502
I'M HITTING THE STREETS.

14:04.540 --> 14:06.337
- YOU'RE STAYING PUT,
CARLTON.

14:07.440 --> 14:08.702
- CHIEF--

14:08.740 --> 14:11.049
- NO, I CAN'T HAVE
MY LEAD DETECTIVE ON THE STREET

14:11.080 --> 14:13.469
WITH A TARGET ON HIM.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.875
- OKAY, SO I'LL
ORGANIZE THINGS FROM HERE.

14:15.920 --> 14:18.514
- I ALSO CAN'T HAVE
ANY APPEARANCE OF BIAS

14:18.550 --> 14:20.950
OR A CONFLICT OF INTEREST
IN THIS INVESTIGATION.

14:20.990 --> 14:23.049
O'HARA, YOU'RE TAKING OVER
AS POINT.

14:23.090 --> 14:24.523
I'LL ASSIGN SOMEONE
THE FIELD WORK,

14:24.560 --> 14:26.084
YOU GO OVER THE OLD CASES.

14:26.130 --> 14:27.688
SPENCER, I NEED YOU TO GET
ANY READINGS YOU CAN

14:27.730 --> 14:28.594
FROM THE EVIDENCE.

14:28.630 --> 14:30.825
AND I WANT YOU
KEPT IN THIS ROOM

14:30.870 --> 14:32.326
UNDER 24-HOUR GUARD.

14:32.370 --> 14:34.031
- WHAT?

14:35.740 --> 14:38.766
- SORRY ABOUT THIS, PARTNER.

14:40.010 --> 14:42.979
- HEY, LASSIE, THE FROZEN YOGURT
GUY'S OUT FRONT.

14:43.010 --> 14:46.878
DID YOU WANT TO GO GET ONE?
OH, WAIT, YOU CAN'T.

14:48.220 --> 14:49.312
YOW!

14:56.890 --> 14:59.085
- THESE CASES OFFER
THE MOST PROMISE.

14:59.130 --> 15:00.449
IN EACH OF THEM THE PERP
THREATENED PHYSICAL HARM

15:00.500 --> 15:02.024
AGAINST LASSITER IN PUBLIC.

15:02.060 --> 15:03.197
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S DIG IN.

15:03.230 --> 15:05.869
- ARE YOU LOOKING
AT PALERMO?

15:05.900 --> 15:07.993
DON'T FORGET ABOUT PALERMO.

15:08.040 --> 15:10.565
- WE WON'T.

15:10.610 --> 15:12.134
- HOW 'BOUT FLETCHER?

15:12.170 --> 15:14.968
- HIM TOO.

15:16.410 --> 15:18.878
- O'HARA, HOLD THAT UP
A LITTLE HIGHER SO I CAN SEE IT.

15:18.910 --> 15:20.639
- THIS ISN'T GONNA WORK.

15:21.320 --> 15:22.719
- WHAT?

15:30.030 --> 15:32.351
- MUCH BETTER.
- ABSOLUTELY.

15:32.390 --> 15:35.621
- WE'RE JUST MISSING ONE THING.
- YEAH, PIZZA.

15:35.660 --> 15:37.719
- I WAS GOING TO SAY
AN IMMERSION THERAPY TANK

15:37.770 --> 15:39.988
AND HALLUCINOGENS,
BUT I COULD GO FOR A SLICE.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.735
- YEAH, I'M HUNGRY.
- I'LL CALL LUIGI'S.

15:41.770 --> 15:43.738
THEY DELIVER.
- THEY DELIVER HALLUCINOGENS?

15:43.770 --> 15:45.237
THAT DOESN'T SEEM LEGAL,
DOES IT?

15:45.270 --> 15:46.908
- WHERE'S THE CORDLESS PHONE?

15:46.940 --> 15:48.874
- WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME?
- YOU ALWAYS LOSE IT.

15:48.910 --> 15:51.105
- NO, I DON'T LOSE IT.

15:51.150 --> 15:53.414
I PLACE IT SOMEWHERE
THAT LATER ELUDES ME.

15:53.450 --> 15:55.111
- THAT'S THE SAME THING
AS LOSING IT, SHAWN.

15:55.150 --> 15:57.618
- MAYBE TO THOSE OF US
WITHOUT THE NUANCE CHROMOSOME.

15:57.650 --> 15:59.686
- MAYBE INSTEAD OF
ARGUING ABOUT IT,

15:59.720 --> 16:01.813
WE SHOULD ACTUALLY
LOOK FOR IT.

16:03.590 --> 16:05.956
OH, WOW,
WHOSE ELLIPTICAL IS THIS?

16:05.990 --> 16:07.924
- WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A LOOK
AT OUR BODIES

16:07.960 --> 16:10.292
AND JUDGE FOR YOURSELF.

16:10.330 --> 16:13.595
- GUS, WHEN DID YOU GET IT?

16:14.640 --> 16:16.164
- WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A LOOK
AT 'EM IN A MONTH,

16:16.200 --> 16:18.668
WHEN I'M RIPPED TO THE BONE,
HAVE AN EIGHT-PACK.

16:18.710 --> 16:20.530
POSSIBLY NINE.
TALL BOYS.

16:20.580 --> 16:21.672
YOU CAN PLAY MY ABS LIKE A HARP.

16:21.710 --> 16:22.677
- HE NEVER USES IT.

16:22.710 --> 16:24.348
- YOU KNOW,
I JUST JOINED A GYM,

16:24.380 --> 16:27.042
AND I GOT INTO THIS
INCREDIBLE FITNESS REGIMEN.

16:27.080 --> 16:28.672
IT'S ALL ABOUT SELF-MOTIVATION.

16:28.720 --> 16:30.608
SHAWN, IF YOU WANT ME
TO TEACH YOU SOME OF THE TRICKS

16:30.650 --> 16:31.947
MY TRAINER TAUGHT ME...

16:31.990 --> 16:33.184
- NO THANKS, JULES.

16:33.220 --> 16:34.448
I'M NOT REALLY INTO
THE WHOLE MOTIVATIONAL

16:34.490 --> 16:38.324
TONY ROBBINS THING--
I PREFER HIS BROTHER BASKIN.

17:01.520 --> 17:05.513
- HELLO, MRS. GARCIA.
IS YOUR HUSBAND AVAILABLE?

17:05.550 --> 17:07.711
I SEE.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.785
WOULD YOU PLEASE GIVE HIM
A MESSAGE FOR ME?

17:09.820 --> 17:12.220
THIS IS DETECTIVE
CARLTON LASSITER.

17:12.260 --> 17:14.751
LET THAT FAT BASTARD KNOW

17:14.800 --> 17:17.428
THAT I KNOW THAT HE'S THE ONE
TRYING TO KILL ME,

17:17.470 --> 17:18.698
AND IF HE WANTS TO TANGLE,
BABY,

17:18.730 --> 17:21.893
MY DANCE CARD
IS WIDE OPEN!

17:22.900 --> 17:24.834
I SEE.

17:25.740 --> 17:28.072
I AM VERY SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS, MA'AM.

17:28.110 --> 17:30.249
I ACTUALLY HAD AN UNCLE
WITH CORONARY DISEASE,

17:30.280 --> 17:33.943
SO I UNDERSTAN D--
HELLO?

17:33.980 --> 17:36.175
- CAN'T FIND THAT PHONE
ANYWHERE.

17:36.220 --> 17:38.438
WELL, I GUESS WE'RE HAVING
DORITOS FOR DINNER.

17:38.490 --> 17:41.653
- [scoffs] YOU SAY THAT
LIKE IT'S A BAD THING.

17:49.330 --> 17:53.437
OH! VIBRATIONS PIERCING THROUGH
FROM THE OTHER SIDE.

17:53.470 --> 17:55.688
PERSON OF INTEREST,
POSSIBLE SHOOTER,

17:55.740 --> 17:57.401
JUST RELEASED FROM PRISON.

17:57.440 --> 18:00.807
IVAN. . . PETROVICH.

18:00.840 --> 18:03.035
- I WAS JUST READING
THAT GUY'S FILE.

18:03.080 --> 18:05.071
HE'S SOME SORT OF DRUG LORD
OR SOMETHING.

18:05.110 --> 18:06.304
WHERE IS IT?

18:06.350 --> 18:09.717
HERE IT IS.

18:09.750 --> 18:12.048
THAT'S WEIRD.
- WHAT?

18:12.090 --> 18:13.182
- OUR NAMES ARE LISTED
ON THE CASE,

18:13.220 --> 18:14.710
BUT SHAWN AND I DIDN'T
WORK ON IT.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.512
- AND YET WE GOT PAID FOR IT.
ISN'T THAT GREAT?

18:16.560 --> 18:17.652
- I WAS NEVER PAID FOR IT.

18:17.690 --> 18:18.725
- MAYBE WE DIDN'T
GET PAID FOR IT.

18:18.760 --> 18:20.296
- SHAWN, DID YOU OR DID YOU NOT
GET PAID?

18:20.330 --> 18:23.049
- I DON'T KNOW, JULES.
I'D HAVE TO CHECK SOME FILES,

18:23.100 --> 18:24.624
CRUNCH SOME NUMBERS,
PLACE SOME CALLS.

18:24.670 --> 18:26.319
- YOU TOOK MONEY FOR A CASE
THAT YOU DIDN'T DO?

18:26.370 --> 18:29.066
- I ANSWERED THE PHONE,
AND IT WAS THE CHIEF,

18:29.100 --> 18:30.761
WHICH TECHNICALLY MAKES ME
A CONSULTANT.

18:30.810 --> 18:33.199
WAS IT A MISDIAL? MAYBE.
WHY ARE WE SPLITTING HAIRS?

18:33.240 --> 18:35.800
- IVAN PETROVICH ISN'T JUST
ANY KIND OF DRUG LORD.

18:35.840 --> 18:36.829
HE'S THE WORST KIND.

18:36.880 --> 18:38.541
HE TARGETS HIGH SCHOOL KIDS.

18:38.580 --> 18:40.969
REMEMBER THAT QUARTERBACK
THAT OD'D?

18:41.020 --> 18:42.169
IT WAS IN THE NEWSPAPER.

18:42.220 --> 18:44.142
- I ONLY READ
THE LONDON FINANCIAL TIMES

18:44.190 --> 18:46.909
AND DOG FANCY.

18:57.530 --> 18:59.521
OH, BOY.

18:59.570 --> 19:02.198
I OFFICIALLY FEEL GUILTY.

19:02.240 --> 19:04.538
I'LL RETURN THE $500,
PLUS INTEREST.

19:04.570 --> 19:06.709
I'LL APOLOGIZE TO THE FAMILY
AND, UH...

19:06.740 --> 19:09.504
I'LL DO THE THING IN THE BOX
WITH THE GUY IN THE...THING.

19:09.540 --> 19:10.768
- CON FESSION?
- YEAH.

19:10.810 --> 19:11.970
- I NEED TO GET BACK
TO THE STATION

19:12.010 --> 19:13.910
AND TELL VICK
ABOUT PETROVICH.

19:13.950 --> 19:15.542
ENJOY YOUR DORITOS.

19:15.580 --> 19:16.877
- THAT'S A BUMMER.

19:16.920 --> 19:18.649
- SHOULD WE START TRYING
TO TRACK THIS GUY DOWN?

19:18.690 --> 19:20.578
- THE SOONER WE DO,
THE SOONER LASSIE ISN'T

19:20.620 --> 19:23.282
SEQUESTERED AT THE STATION.

19:23.330 --> 19:25.890
EHH, IT COULD PROBABLY WAIT
TILL TOMORROW.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.218
- I REMEMBER PETROVICH.

19:31.270 --> 19:34.433
HE'S THE WORST KIND OF SCUM
THAT THERE IS.

19:34.470 --> 19:38.406
ALL RIGHT, I'M PUTTING
AN APB OUT ON HIM.

19:38.440 --> 19:41.034
WHY IS MY SPEAKERPHONE ON?

19:41.080 --> 19:44.641
- CHIEF, I DEMAND TO BE THE ONE
TO BRING IN PETROVICH.

19:44.680 --> 19:46.739
- HE WAS LISTENING IN
ON OUR CONVERSATION?

19:46.780 --> 19:48.247
- CHIEF, MY PARTNER
HAS THE RIGHT TO KNOW

19:48.280 --> 19:49.975
WHO TRIED TO KILL HIM.

19:50.020 --> 19:51.681
- LOOK, ALL RIGHT,
THIS ONE IS PERSONAL.

19:51.720 --> 19:53.119
PETROVICH IS A MONSTER.

19:53.150 --> 19:55.459
THAT ONE FAMILY
WHOSE LIVES HE DESTROYED

19:55.490 --> 19:56.889
WHEN THEIR SON OD'D
ON HIS POISON--

19:56.920 --> 19:58.683
DURING HIS TRIAL,
HE TURNED AROUND

19:58.730 --> 20:00.083
AND WINKED AT THEM.

20:00.130 --> 20:01.449
- I REMEMBER AS WELL
AS YOU DO.

20:01.500 --> 20:03.092
- AND ALL I WAS ABLE
TO GET HIM ON

20:03.130 --> 20:04.222
IS A WEAPONS CHARGE.

20:04.270 --> 20:06.295
NOW, THAT HAS EATEN ME UP
FOR TH REE YEARS.

20:06.330 --> 20:07.797
- THAT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

20:07.840 --> 20:10.035
YOU GOT HIM ON WHAT YOU COULD,
AND WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE.

20:10.070 --> 20:12.937
LOOK, I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT
YOUR SAFETY.

20:12.970 --> 20:14.631
THIS MAN IS HELL-BENT
ON REVENGE,

20:14.680 --> 20:16.898
AND HE'S TARGETING THE ONE
OFFICER WHO PUT HIM AWAY.

20:18.650 --> 20:20.914
- I DIDN'T WORK THAT CASE ALONE.

20:20.950 --> 20:23.077
MCNAB WAS THERE
WHEN I BUSTED PETROVICH.

20:23.120 --> 20:25.042
- WHERE'S MCNAB?
- HE'S OFF DUTY.

20:27.190 --> 20:29.158
I'LL RUN THE SEARCH
ON PETROVICH.

20:29.190 --> 20:31.556
O'HARA, GIVE MCNAB A CALL, JUST
TO MAKE SURE THAT HE'S OKAY.

20:31.590 --> 20:34.696
BETTER YET,
GO BY HIS PLACE.

20:36.130 --> 20:40.760
CARLTON, I'M SORRY.
OFFICERS, PLEASE.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.893
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

20:47.880 --> 20:52.601
- [sighs] DAMN IT!

20:52.650 --> 20:54.572
[intercom ringing]

20:54.620 --> 20:57.009
COME ON, MCNAB.

20:57.050 --> 20:58.278
GO AROUND BACK.

20:58.320 --> 21:00.652
MCNAB!

21:05.160 --> 21:08.152
- HELLO.
- OH, THANK GOD.

21:08.200 --> 21:09.451
- I WAS JUST IN THE SHOWER.
WHAT'S UP?

21:09.500 --> 21:11.991
- IVAN PETROVICH TRIED
TO KILL LASSITER,

21:12.030 --> 21:13.099
AND WE KNOW YOU WERE IN
ON HIS ARREST,

21:13.130 --> 21:14.267
AND HE'S THREATENED YOU TOO.

21:14.300 --> 21:15.699
- PETROVICH--
THAT GUY'S THE DEVIL.

21:15.740 --> 21:18.334
- FOR YOUR SAFETY, BECKETT HERE
IS GONNA STAY WITH YOU.

21:18.370 --> 21:19.462
I'M GONNA CHECK BACK
IN A LITTLE WHILE, OKAY?

21:19.510 --> 21:20.704
- OKAY.
- NICE ROBE.

21:20.740 --> 21:22.332
- THANKS.

21:22.380 --> 21:23.904
HEY, BECKETT,
I'M JUST GONNA GRAB MY MAIL.

21:23.950 --> 21:26.407
GO ON IN.
I'LL MAKE US SOME EGGS.

21:39.730 --> 21:42.153
- WELL, HOW BAD IS HE?
- HE'S STABLE.

21:42.200 --> 21:45.692
LOOKS LIKE HE'S GONNA
BE FINE.

21:45.730 --> 21:47.891
LUCKILY,
IT WAS A CRUDE DEVICE.

21:47.940 --> 21:50.329
IT WAS RIGGED TO GO OFF

21:50.370 --> 21:51.667
THE SECOND
THE MAILBOX KEY WAS TURNED.

21:51.710 --> 21:52.802
THE BLAST BLEW HIM
INTO THE POOL

21:52.840 --> 21:56.139
AND PROBABLY SAVED HIS LIFE.

21:56.180 --> 21:59.399
- OH, HELL.

21:59.450 --> 22:01.441
[cell phone vibrating]

22:06.520 --> 22:09.057
- HELLO,
THIS IS BURTON GUSTER.

22:09.090 --> 22:10.682
- GUS, THANK GOD
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT!

22:10.730 --> 22:12.379
- JULIET?

22:12.430 --> 22:13.897
- IT LOOKS LIKE PETROVICH
MAY BE TARGETING

22:13.930 --> 22:16.353
EVERYONE WHO WAS ON THE CASE,
WHICH INCLUDES YOU TWO.

22:16.400 --> 22:19.028
- BUT WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY
WORK ON THE CASE.

22:19.070 --> 22:20.833
- I DON'T KNOW HOW,
BUT SOMEHOW PETROVICH

22:20.870 --> 22:23.532
MAY HAVE SEEN THE FILE.
HAVE YOU TALKED TO SHAWN?

22:27.610 --> 22:29.430
- SHAWN?

22:29.480 --> 22:30.970
- [coughs]

22:31.010 --> 22:32.648
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

22:32.680 --> 22:36.844
- [panting]

22:45.030 --> 22:47.897
[beeping]

23:01.940 --> 23:03.874
- THE BOMB SQUAD IS ON ITS WAY.
[beeping]

23:03.910 --> 23:05.775
HOW DID YOU FIGURE
THIS THING WAS BOOBY-TRAPPED?

23:05.810 --> 23:08.813
- I SAW...THAT PETROVICH
WENT AFTER MCNAB

23:08.850 --> 23:11.910
ON THE LOCAL NEWS.
I PUT IT ALL TOGETHER.

23:11.950 --> 23:13.451
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE'RE BEING TARGETED

23:13.490 --> 23:15.515
FOR A CASE
THAT WE NEVER WORKED ON.

23:15.560 --> 23:16.913
- WELL, AT LEAST
WE GOT PAID FOR IT.

23:16.960 --> 23:18.279
- REALLY?

23:18.330 --> 23:20.992
I'M STARRING IN THE ELLIPTICAL
VERSION OF SPEED,

23:21.030 --> 23:22.497
AND YOU'RE GUILTING ME
OVER MONEY?

23:22.530 --> 23:24.225
- JUST FOR THE RECORD,
IT'S MORE LIKE LETHAL WEAPON 2.

23:24.270 --> 23:26.090
THE ONE WHERE DANNY GLOVER
FOUND THE BOMB

23:26.130 --> 23:27.688
ATTACHED TO HIS TOILET.

23:27.740 --> 23:31.062
- OH, GOD, I WOULD KILL
TO BE ON A TOILET RIGHT NOW.

23:31.110 --> 23:33.499
[beeping]

23:33.540 --> 23:35.838
I'M NOT GONNA DIE
ON THIS THING, AM I?

23:35.880 --> 23:37.233
- DON'T THINK LIKE THAT, SHAWN.

23:37.280 --> 23:38.770
WHATEVER HAPPENS,
I'LL BE RIGHT HERE.

23:38.810 --> 23:41.870
WHERE THE HECK ARE THEY?

23:41.920 --> 23:44.445
- GUS...I'M REALLY TIRED.

23:44.490 --> 23:46.139
- WAIT, WAIT.
NO, NO, NO.

23:46.190 --> 23:47.487
JUST HANG IN THERE, SHAWN.

23:47.520 --> 23:48.817
THEY'LL BE HERE
ANY SECOND NOW.

23:48.860 --> 23:52.159
- LOOK, I JUST--

23:52.190 --> 23:56.229
I JUST GOTTA SAY...THAT...

23:56.260 --> 23:57.898
[grunting]

23:57.930 --> 23:59.067
- I KNOW.

23:59.100 --> 24:02.228
- I GOT $800
FOR THE PETROVICH CASE.

24:02.270 --> 24:04.431
NOT $500.

24:04.470 --> 24:07.234
- I FORGIVE YOU.

24:07.270 --> 24:09.579
[door opens]
- SHAWN, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

24:09.610 --> 24:10.907
WHERE'S THE BOMB?
- IT'S DOWN THERE.

24:10.950 --> 24:12.247
- WHY ARE YOU EXERCISING?

24:12.280 --> 24:15.579
- IF HIS HEART RATE DROPS
BELOW 150, HE'S TOAST.

24:15.620 --> 24:19.078
- OH, MY GOD, I WROTE THIS NOTE.
- WHAT?

24:19.120 --> 24:21.054
- I LEFT IT FOR SHAWN
AS A MOTIVATOR.

24:21.090 --> 24:22.318
I DO THE SAME THING
BEFORE EACH WORKOUT.

24:22.360 --> 24:23.918
IT'S A TRICK
MY TRAINER TAUGHT ME.

24:23.960 --> 24:26.326
- WHAT KIND OF SICK TRAINER
HAVE YOU BEEN WORKING WITH?

24:26.360 --> 24:28.851
- WAIT A SECOND, SO WHAT IS
THE BEEPING, BLINKING THING?

24:32.470 --> 24:36.463
[beeping]

24:39.110 --> 24:40.338
- WE'RE IDIOTS.

24:40.370 --> 24:44.340
- OH...WILL YOU...
PLEASE MAKE IT STOP.

24:44.380 --> 24:46.041
[phone continues beeping]
OH, THANK GOD.

24:46.080 --> 24:48.947
THANK GOD.

24:48.980 --> 24:49.969
[thud]

24:57.530 --> 25:02.627
- [indistinct whispering]

25:04.970 --> 25:07.120
OKAY, GO. GO.

25:09.740 --> 25:11.367
- GO BACK.
- ALL RIGHT.

25:12.610 --> 25:13.975
- WATCH MY BACK.

25:15.540 --> 25:17.474
- OKAY, OKAY.

25:22.520 --> 25:23.817
- ENOUGH!

25:23.850 --> 25:25.818
IF PETROVICH KNEW
YOU WERE LISTED ON THE REPORT,

25:25.850 --> 25:27.112
HE WOULD'VE ALREADY
MADE A MOVE.

25:27.150 --> 25:28.754
NOW, MAN UP AND LET'S GO.

25:28.790 --> 25:30.951
- WE'RE COOL.
- WE'RE MEN.

25:30.990 --> 25:33.151
[loud vibration]
GET DOWN!

25:36.330 --> 25:38.469
- EVERYBODY'S GOOD?
- WOW.

25:38.500 --> 25:40.058
- EVERYBODY'S GOOD.

25:44.940 --> 25:46.362
- HEY, IT'S MCNAB.

25:46.410 --> 25:47.570
I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS OUT
OF THE HOSPITAL YET.

25:47.610 --> 25:49.077
BUZZ, BUDDY!

25:49.110 --> 25:51.101
- OH, HEY, GUYS.

25:51.150 --> 25:53.448
- WOW. THAT BOMB DID A NUMBER
ON YOUR EYEBROW.

25:53.480 --> 25:54.879
- BLEW IT CLEAN OFF.

25:54.920 --> 25:56.740
- AMAZING. JUST THE BROW.
- IT'S OKAY.

25:56.780 --> 25:58.884
I'VE STILL GOT
ONE GOOD ONE.

25:58.920 --> 26:01.059
- HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

26:01.090 --> 26:02.648
- UH, THE DOCTORS SAY I HAVE
A SEVERE CONCUSSION,

26:02.690 --> 26:05.079
BUT I FINE FEEL.

26:05.130 --> 26:06.222
PLUS I'VE LOST PARTS
OF THREE TOES.

26:06.260 --> 26:08.296
- THAT'S TERRIBLE, MAN.
- YEAH.

26:08.330 --> 26:09.649
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU, SHAWN?

26:09.700 --> 26:11.019
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE
A TICKLE IN YOUR THROAT.

26:11.070 --> 26:13.425
- OH, NO, I'M JUST
A LITTLE DEHYDRATED.

26:13.470 --> 26:14.789
- OH, JEEZ.

26:14.840 --> 26:17.468
HERE I AM, GOING ON AND ON
ABOUT LOSING TOES

26:17.500 --> 26:19.559
AND GETTING BLOWN 20 FEET
INTO A SWIMMING POOL,

26:19.610 --> 26:20.838
AND YOU'RE DYING OF THIRST.

26:20.880 --> 26:22.632
LET'S GET YOU SOME WATER.
- NO, BUZZ.

26:22.680 --> 26:24.079
BUZZ, I CAN GET IT, MAN.
- OH, NO, IT'S OKAY, I--

26:24.110 --> 26:25.748
- NO, YOU--YOU--
YOU STAY HERE.

26:25.780 --> 26:29.079
YOU KNOW, DO WHATEVER--
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

26:37.290 --> 26:39.588
I HAD A KILLER WORKOUT
THIS MORNING.

26:39.630 --> 26:42.292
- ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE,
LISTEN UP.

26:42.330 --> 26:44.298
AS MOST OF YOU KNOW,

26:44.330 --> 26:46.491
IVAN PETROVICH IS BACK
ON THE STREETS,

26:46.530 --> 26:48.839
AND HE'S TARGETING OUR OWN.

26:48.870 --> 26:51.407
AND THIS MORNING HE WENT AFTER
OFFICER MCNAB WITH A BOMB.

26:51.440 --> 26:55.604
BRINGING IN PETROVICH IS
OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY.

26:55.640 --> 26:57.949
AND THE PERSON WHO I'VE PUT
IN CHARGE OF THIS INVESTIGATION,

26:57.980 --> 27:00.540
DESPITE MY CONCERN
FOR HIS SAFETY,

27:00.580 --> 27:04.038
IS THE MAN WHO KNOWS PETROVICH
MORE THAN ALL OF US COMBINED:

27:04.090 --> 27:06.445
DETECTIVE CARLTON LASSITER.

27:06.490 --> 27:09.789
[cheers and applause]
- WHOO! BIG DINGER! LASSIE!

27:09.820 --> 27:11.219
- ALL RIGHT,
THANK YOU, EVERYONE.

27:11.260 --> 27:12.454
IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK
ON THE CASE.

27:12.490 --> 27:14.390
NOW, I'VE MADE UP A LIST
OF ALL THE PLACES

27:14.430 --> 27:15.829
I THINK PETROVICH
MIGHT BE HIDING.

27:15.860 --> 27:17.498
THEY'RE BEING PASSED OUT NOW.

27:17.530 --> 27:19.498
I WANT EACH LOCATION
SURVEILLED

27:19.530 --> 27:20.895
OR CHECKED OUT IMMEDIATELY.

27:20.940 --> 27:23.636
YOU'VE ALL BEEN ASSIGNED
AN INDIVIDUAL TEAM,

27:23.670 --> 27:25.604
WHICH YOU'LL FIND IN THE LOWER
RIGHT HAND CORNER.

27:25.640 --> 27:27.631
- EXCUSE ME.
- WHAT? WHAT IS IT?

27:27.680 --> 27:30.331
- SHAWN SPENCER HERE.
I'M HAVING A PSYCHIC VISION.

27:30.380 --> 27:33.076
IT'S OF A PLACE THAT'S
NOT ON YOUR LIST.

27:33.110 --> 27:35.249
MARTIN'S FOOGOO CHAIR.

27:35.280 --> 27:38.511
NO. SONNY AND CHER--
NO.

27:38.550 --> 27:41.314
LAIR. MARTIN'S LAIR
OF THE WHITE WORM.

27:41.360 --> 27:45.023
- NO.
- MARTIN'S...SHOE REPAIR?

27:45.060 --> 27:46.789
- WELL, THAT'S A PHONY BUSINESS
PETROVICH USED

27:46.830 --> 27:48.320
AS A FRONT FOR HIS
DRUG TRADE.

27:48.360 --> 27:51.158
HE WOULDN'T BE HIDING THERE.
IT'S THE SIZE OF A PHONE BOOTH.

27:53.530 --> 27:55.737
- THERE'S AN EXTRA ROOM.
- HUH?

27:55.770 --> 27:56.964
- THERE'S MORE
TO THAT PLACE.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.537
LASSIE, THIS IS
A VERY STRONG HIT.

27:59.570 --> 28:01.128
I THINK IT'S WORTH
CHECKING OUT.

28:02.710 --> 28:04.769
- WHY DON'T YOU STOP BY?

28:04.810 --> 28:06.209
- FINE.

28:06.250 --> 28:07.979
YOU RIDE WITH
O'HARA AND I.
THE REST OF YOU,

28:08.020 --> 28:09.749
LET'S GET ON IT.
WE'VE GOT WORK
TO DO.

28:22.800 --> 28:23.994
ALL RIGHT,
THERE'S NOBODY IN HERE.

28:24.030 --> 28:25.292
- WELL, THAT'S A SHAME.

28:25.330 --> 28:27.025
I WAS HOPING DANIEL DAY LEWIS
WOULD BE HERE

28:27.070 --> 28:28.162
TO FIX THE RIP
IN MY TRETORNS.

28:28.200 --> 28:30.191
- SHAWN...
- THE MAN COBBLES, GUS.

28:30.240 --> 28:32.003
- I KNEW THIS WAS
A WASTE OF TIME.

28:32.040 --> 28:35.009
LET'S GO, O'HARA.
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

28:35.040 --> 28:37.338
DADDY'S GETTING SOMETHING.

28:37.380 --> 28:39.371
OH, YEAH, HE'S DEFINITELY
GETTING SOMETHING.

28:39.410 --> 28:41.446
I'M SENSING THERE'S
AN EXTRA ROOM

28:41.480 --> 28:42.447
ATTACHED TO THIS PLACE.

28:42.480 --> 28:44.289
A SECRET ROOM.

28:44.320 --> 28:48.381
WE JUST HAVE TO FIND THE,
UH, SECRET--AHA!

28:48.420 --> 28:51.150
IT'S NOT THIS.

28:53.430 --> 28:55.295
DAMN IT

28:55.330 --> 28:59.061
AH, BUT WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE?

28:59.100 --> 29:00.727
*

29:00.770 --> 29:04.558
[machine vibrates noisily]

29:05.940 --> 29:07.305
[mouthing words]

29:10.950 --> 29:13.407
- SHAWN, YOU MIGHT WANT
TO LET THIS GO.

29:13.450 --> 29:15.441
- WHAT IS THIS THING?
- SHAWN!

29:15.480 --> 29:17.914
- LOOK, THERE'S GOTTA BE,
LIKE, A SECRET LEVER OR--

29:17.950 --> 29:20.316
- LET'S GO.

29:20.350 --> 29:21.487
[hollow knock]

29:24.430 --> 29:26.625
- DID YOU GUYS HEAR THAT?

29:26.660 --> 29:29.128
IT SOUNDS LIKE PETROVICH
HAS A DEAD SPOT.

29:29.160 --> 29:30.752
- MOVE THAT TABLE.

29:33.070 --> 29:37.666
- [grunts, mutters]

29:37.700 --> 29:39.702
OY!

29:44.050 --> 29:46.371
[door creaks]

29:46.410 --> 29:48.219
I'M GOING DOWN THERE.

30:03.830 --> 30:06.094
[electricity buzzing]

30:06.130 --> 30:08.928
I KNOW YOU'RE DOWN HERE,
PETROVICH.

30:12.440 --> 30:14.328
- WHY DIDN'T WE STAY
UP INSIDE THE SHOE STORE?

30:14.380 --> 30:17.770
- I TOLD YOU...
I GET FREAKED OUT BY TASSELS.

30:28.120 --> 30:29.985
[soft thud, squeaking]

30:30.020 --> 30:32.079
[gunshots]

30:37.130 --> 30:38.859
- I GOT HIM.

30:51.950 --> 30:54.748
- LOOK AT THAT.
LASSIE'S GETTING SOME PRESS.

30:54.780 --> 30:57.613
- GOOD FOR HIM.
HE DESERVES IT.

30:57.650 --> 30:59.584
- 50 BUCKS TO THE GUY
WHO CAN GET ON CAMERA THE MOST.

30:59.620 --> 31:01.759
- YOU'RE ON.

31:01.790 --> 31:03.212
- HOW DOES IT FEEL
TO HAVE TAKEN OUT

31:03.260 --> 31:05.683
ONE OF SANTA BARBARA'S
MOST NOTORIOUS DRUG LORDS,

31:05.730 --> 31:08.119
A MAN WHO WAS PERSONALLY
TARGETING YOU?

31:08.160 --> 31:10.958
- WELL, I'M HAPPY THAT
PARTICULAR PIECE OF SCUM

31:11.000 --> 31:12.490
IS OFF THE STREET.

31:12.530 --> 31:14.031
LET'S JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT.

31:14.070 --> 31:16.994
- DESCRIBE THE MOMENT FOR US.
WERE YOU SCARED?

31:17.040 --> 31:19.508
- I DON'T GET SCARED, LINDA.

31:19.540 --> 31:22.304
HE REACHED FOR HIS GUN,
AND I REACTED.

31:25.180 --> 31:27.171
MAYBE YOU SHOULD ASK PETROVICH
THAT QUESTION.

31:27.210 --> 31:29.610
- I CAN'T. HE'S DEAD.

31:29.650 --> 31:31.914
- RIGHT.

31:31.950 --> 31:33.952
- SO WHAT'S NEXT, DETECTIVE?

31:33.990 --> 31:37.517
- WELL, THERE'S STILL--
KNOCK IT OFF!

31:41.230 --> 31:43.824
THERE'S STILL QUITE A BIT
OF POLICE WORK TO BE DONE,

31:43.860 --> 31:45.896
BUT I AM GONNA TAKE THE TIME
TO VISIT

31:45.930 --> 31:47.022
SOME OF THE MEMBERS
OF OUR COMMUNITY

31:47.070 --> 31:48.935
WHO WERE MOST AFFECTED
BY PETROVICH.

31:48.970 --> 31:50.665
AND I'LL TELL YOU,
IT'S GONNA FEEL PRETTY GOOD

31:50.700 --> 31:51.735
TO GIVE THEM THIS NEWS.

31:51.770 --> 31:53.635
- THERE IT IS.
- GREAT. THANK YOU.

31:53.670 --> 31:57.106
- AND HERE IT COMES.

31:57.140 --> 32:00.871
AND...WAIT FOR IT.
WAIT FOR IT...

32:00.910 --> 32:02.468
- I DON'T GET SCARED, LINDA.

32:02.520 --> 32:03.714
- [makes gunshot sound]

32:03.750 --> 32:06.139
4 1/2 SECONDS. I WIN.

32:06.190 --> 32:07.612
BOOM!
- THERE'S NO WAY.

32:07.650 --> 32:11.620
- SORRY, GUS.
THE WATCH...

32:11.660 --> 32:15.528
DOES NOT LIE.

32:15.560 --> 32:19.166
OH, DORITOS,
I'LL NEVER GET SICK OF YOU.

32:19.200 --> 32:21.395
- YOU HAVE TO ADMIT,
LASSITER STEPPED UP BIG TODAY.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.089
- YEAH, I GUESS.

32:23.140 --> 32:24.630
- DO YOU NOT AGREE?

32:24.670 --> 32:26.604
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.

32:26.640 --> 32:28.369
DON'T YOU THINK THERE WAS
SOMETHING WEIRD

32:28.410 --> 32:29.502
ABOUT THE WAY
THAT WHOLE THING WENT DOWN?

32:29.540 --> 32:31.178
- THERE WERE LOTS OF THINGS
THAT WERE WEIRD.

32:31.210 --> 32:33.007
LIKE YOUR IRRATIONAL FEAR
OF TASSELS.

32:33.050 --> 32:35.075
- IRRATIONAL?
- YES.

32:35.120 --> 32:37.509
- WHAT PURPOSE DO TASSELS
SERVE ON SHOES, GUS?

32:37.550 --> 32:38.619
- I DON'T KNOW.

32:38.650 --> 32:40.083
- I DO. EVIL.

32:40.120 --> 32:43.749
- SHAWN.
- I'M SORRY.

32:43.790 --> 32:47.328
THERE'S STILL SOMETHING
BUGGING ME ABOUT IT.

32:47.360 --> 32:50.557
- YOU WANT ME TO DO A LITTLE
ARMCHAIR PSYCHOLOGY ON YOU?

32:50.600 --> 32:53.421
- NO, I DO NOT.
- I THINK YOU'RE
JEALOUS OF LASSIE.

32:53.470 --> 32:56.598
- I'M HAPPY TO ADMIT
THAT LASSIE SUCCEEDED.

32:56.640 --> 32:58.835
- REALLY? THEN WHY DID YOU
JUST PUT "SUCCEEDED"

32:58.870 --> 32:59.700
IN AIR QUOTES?

32:59.740 --> 33:01.674
- OKAY, FINE.

33:01.710 --> 33:05.009
LASSIE DID GREAT TODAY.
THERE, YOU HAPPY?

33:05.050 --> 33:06.972
- I WOULD BE HAPPIER
IF YOU REALLY MEANT IT.

33:07.010 --> 33:10.616
- LASSIE...DID GREAT TODAY.
- SHAWN.

33:10.650 --> 33:13.084
- LASSIE DID GREAT TODAY.
- OH, GOD.

33:13.120 --> 33:14.951
- LASSIE DID GREAT TODAY.

33:14.990 --> 33:16.617
- YOU KNOW WHAT...
- * TODAY

33:16.660 --> 33:19.720
- REWIND HIS INTERVIEW.
I'M RETIMING.

33:23.130 --> 33:26.258
- AS PROMISED, AN EXCLUSIVE
INTERVIEW WITH THE DETECTIVE

33:26.300 --> 33:30.088
WHO SINGLE-HANDEDLY TOOK OUT
NOTORIOUS DRUG BOSS--

33:30.140 --> 33:31.334
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

33:36.480 --> 33:38.573
- THE SHOOTER HAD NO SCAR.

33:38.610 --> 33:39.747
I TAKE IT ALL BACK.

33:39.780 --> 33:41.270
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT, SHAWN?

33:41.320 --> 33:42.969
- LOOK AT PETROVICH'S
LEFT HAND.

33:43.020 --> 33:44.783
- WHAT?
- JUST LOOK AT IT!

33:44.820 --> 33:47.243
YOU SEE THAT SCAR?

33:47.290 --> 33:48.484
- YEAH. SO?

33:48.520 --> 33:52.126
- SO PETROVICH
WASN'T THE GUY
IN THE BAR, GUS.

33:52.160 --> 33:53.821
- WHY HAVEN'T YOU BEEN
PICKING UP? I'VE BEEN CALLING.

33:53.860 --> 33:55.225
- WE DIDN'T HEAR THE--

34:00.530 --> 34:02.293
THIS IS NOT.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

34:02.340 --> 34:04.069
- I DON'T KNOW WHY THOSE THINGS
GIVE ME SO MUCH TROUBLE.

34:04.110 --> 34:05.304
- FORGET ABOUT THAT.

34:05.340 --> 34:07.103
I JUST SAW THE CORONER'S REPORT
ON PETROVICH.

34:07.140 --> 34:08.869
HE HAD ALREADY BEEN DEAD
FOR TWO HOURS

34:08.910 --> 34:09.877
BEFORE WE GOT THERE.

34:09.910 --> 34:11.138
- LASSITER SHOT A DEAD GUY?

34:11.180 --> 34:12.477
- SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT.

34:12.510 --> 34:14.410
- SO WHOEVER'S TARGETING
LASSITER AND MCNAB

34:14.450 --> 34:15.576
IS STILL OUT THERE.

34:15.620 --> 34:17.747
- HOW DID HE DIE, BY THE WAY?
- DRUG OVERDOSE.

34:17.780 --> 34:18.986
AND A MAJOR ONE AT THAT.

34:19.020 --> 34:21.318
THEY FOUND GIANT AMOUNTS
OF PCP, HEROIN, AND

34:21.360 --> 34:23.385
METHAMPHETAMINE IN HIS SYSTEM.
- DAMN.

34:23.420 --> 34:24.978
- THE GUY'S IN PRISON
FOR TH REE YEARS.

34:25.030 --> 34:26.452
HE GETS OUT AND THEN ODS?

34:26.490 --> 34:28.993
DID THE CORONER'S REPORT
SAY ANYTHING ABOUT

34:29.030 --> 34:31.624
HIM BEING RESTRAINED,
OR ABRASIONS ON HIS BODY?

34:31.670 --> 34:33.797
- YEAH, HE HAD ROPE BURNS
ON HIS WRISTS.

34:37.800 --> 34:39.301
PETROVICH
DIDN'T KILL HIMSELF.

34:39.340 --> 34:41.831
- SOMEONE TIED HIM UP
AND FORCED THE DRUGS ON HIM.

34:51.890 --> 34:54.017
- WAS LASSITER SERIOUS
WHEN HE SAID HE WANTED

34:54.050 --> 34:55.381
TO REACH OUT TO MEMBERS
OF THE COMMUNITY

34:55.420 --> 34:56.717
WHOSE LIVES WERE AFFECTED
THE MOST?

34:56.760 --> 34:58.352
- HE'S BEEN DOING IT
ALL DAY. WHY?

34:58.390 --> 35:01.518
- I THINK HE'S
IN SERIOUS TROUBLE.

35:03.930 --> 35:06.398
- MR. SALAMATCHIA.

35:07.330 --> 35:08.991
- THANKS FOR MEETING ME HERE,
DETECTIVE.

35:09.040 --> 35:10.837
- OF COURSE.

35:10.870 --> 35:13.259
- WOULD YOU MIND?
- OF COURSE NOT, SIR.

35:13.310 --> 35:15.608
I HAVE SOME GREAT NEWS FOR YOU,
IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD ALREADY.

35:15.640 --> 35:18.029
- OH?

35:18.080 --> 35:21.072
WHAT WOULD THAT BE?

35:24.620 --> 35:26.781
- OKAY, THANKS.
LET ME KNOW.

35:26.820 --> 35:28.356
THERE'S STILL NO WORD
FROM LASSITER.

35:28.390 --> 35:29.550
AND THEY CHECKED
SALAMATCHIA'S HOME

35:29.590 --> 35:30.909
BUT THERE'S NOBODY THERE.

35:30.960 --> 35:32.780
- THIS GUY WAS SPECIAL OPS
IN THE MARINES, TWICE DECORATED.

35:32.830 --> 35:34.149
- ARE THERE ANY OTHER ADDRESSES
LISTED FOR HIM?

35:34.200 --> 35:36.088
- IT SAYS HE OWNS A RESTAURANT
ACROSS TOWN.

35:36.130 --> 35:38.189
- WHAT'S THE ADDRESS?

35:38.230 --> 35:40.664
- TODAY IS THE ANNIVERSARY
OF HIS SON'S DEATH.

35:40.700 --> 35:41.997
I KNOW WHERE THEY ARE.

35:50.240 --> 35:52.242
- SO IT WAS YOU
THIS ENTIRE TIME.

35:52.280 --> 35:54.009
I'M SORRY, SIR,
I JUST DON'T GET IT.

35:54.050 --> 35:56.314
- PETROVICH PUMPS DRUGS
INTO OUR SCHOOLS,

35:56.350 --> 35:58.079
AND MY SON ENDS UP DEAD,

35:58.120 --> 36:00.281
AND YOU LOCK HIM AWAY
ON A GUNS CHARGE?

36:00.320 --> 36:02.880
THAT'S MY DEFINITION
OF NOT GETTING IT.

36:02.920 --> 36:05.354
PUT 'EM DOWN.

36:06.930 --> 36:08.522
- LOOK...

36:08.560 --> 36:10.323
THE GUN CHARGE WAS ALL
I COULD GET HIM ON AT THE TIME.

36:10.360 --> 36:11.998
ALL RIGHT?

36:12.030 --> 36:13.463
I WANTED HIM OFF THE STREETS.
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

36:14.870 --> 36:19.603
- POISON HIM.
BLOW HIM UP.

36:19.640 --> 36:20.834
MAKE HIM DEAD.

36:20.870 --> 36:22.974
- THAT'S MURDER.

36:23.010 --> 36:27.640
- NOPE. THAT'S JUSTICE.

36:30.950 --> 36:32.042
I'M A SOLDIER.

36:32.090 --> 36:35.514
I'VE KILLED PEOPLE
WHOSE MUDDY BOOTS

36:35.560 --> 36:39.348
PETROVICH WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH
TO LICK.

36:39.390 --> 36:45.226
HIS DEATH, AND YOURS,
IS JUST MY WAY OF...

36:45.270 --> 36:48.068
BRINGING THINGS BACK
INTO BALANCE.

36:48.100 --> 36:49.658
YOU SEE MY POINT.

36:49.700 --> 36:53.329
- WHAT I SEE IS A DECENT MAN
WHOSE GRIEF HAS DRIVEN HIM

36:53.370 --> 36:54.701
TO THE BREAKING POINT.

36:54.740 --> 36:58.039
- DON'T PRETEND THAT YOU
FEEL SOMETHING FOR ME, PLEASE.

36:58.080 --> 37:00.071
- I'VE GIVEN THE BETTER PART
OF MY CAREER

37:00.110 --> 37:01.372
CHASING THE PETROVICHES
OF THE WORLD

37:01.420 --> 37:02.910
BECAUSE OF PEOPLE LIKE YOU.

37:03.980 --> 37:06.585
I UNDERSTAND THE PAIN
THAT HE'S PUT YOU THROUGH.

37:06.620 --> 37:10.579
- I'VE LOST MY ONLY CHILD,
GONE THROUGH A DIVORCE.

37:10.620 --> 37:12.952
JUST WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU KNOW? HUH?

37:12.990 --> 37:15.424
- MR. SALAMATCHIA--
- NO.

37:15.460 --> 37:18.327
SORRY, DETECTIVE.

37:18.370 --> 37:21.965
- FREEZE!

37:22.000 --> 37:23.365
DROP IT!

37:23.400 --> 37:28.872
- NO. YOU DROP IT
OR I'LL KILL HIM RIGHT NOW.

37:28.910 --> 37:31.640
NOW!

37:32.710 --> 37:34.849
- PLEASE TELL ME ONE OF YOU IS
CARRYING A WEAPON.

37:34.880 --> 37:38.281
- WEAPON? NO.
OH, WAIT.

37:38.320 --> 37:39.389
- HEY!

37:39.420 --> 37:41.888
- IT'S JUST--
IT'S JUST THIS.

37:41.920 --> 37:43.649
- YOU ARE UNBELIEVABLE.

37:43.690 --> 37:47.854
- IT'S OKAY.
IT'S TOTALLY OUT OF RANGE.

37:47.890 --> 37:49.596
- I RECOGNIZE YOU.

37:49.630 --> 37:52.929
- YES, SIR, WE'RE BOTH LISTED
ON THE PETROVICH CASE.

37:52.970 --> 37:54.164
- NO, WE ARE NOT.

37:54.200 --> 37:55.633
- I'M NOT GONNA LIE.
- SINCE WHEN?

37:55.670 --> 37:58.309
- NO, I SAW YOU IN THE BAR.

37:58.340 --> 38:01.161
I KNOW EVERYTHING THERE IS
TO KNOW ABOUT THAT CASE.

38:01.210 --> 38:03.371
YOU WEREN'T ON IT.

38:03.410 --> 38:05.207
- [whispers] ONE TIME.
- WHAT?

38:05.250 --> 38:07.138
- GET THOSE FEET GOING.
COME ON, GET LOW.

38:07.180 --> 38:09.569
GET LOW. ATTABOY.

38:09.620 --> 38:11.542
- ONE TIME.

38:18.860 --> 38:20.452
[thud]
DAMN IT.

38:20.490 --> 38:24.995
- [groaning]

38:30.900 --> 38:33.505
- GOOD WORK.

38:33.540 --> 38:36.577
- YEAH.
GREAT WORK, LASSIE.

38:36.610 --> 38:38.999
- DID YOU JUST THROW
OUR CORDLESS PHONE INTO A TREE?

38:39.050 --> 38:41.348
- A MAN'S LIFE WAS HANGING
IN THE BALANCE.

38:41.380 --> 38:42.677
IT WAS CLEARLY
OUR ONLY MOVE.

38:42.720 --> 38:44.244
- YOU'RE BUYING US
A NEW PHONE, SHAWN.

38:48.420 --> 38:51.423
- YOUR MIND IS NOT
AN OPPONENT, SHAWN.

38:51.460 --> 38:53.121
IT'S A TEAMMATE.

38:53.160 --> 38:56.129
A TEAMMATE THAT'S THERE
FOR YOU IN GOOD TIMES AND BAD.

38:56.160 --> 38:59.596
YOU MAY NOT ALWAYS GET ALONG--
IT MAY BE MOODY...

38:59.630 --> 39:02.360
WEAR YOUR SHOWER SANDALS
WITHOUT PERMISSION.

39:02.400 --> 39:04.664
BUT NEVER DOUBT ITS LOYALTY.

39:04.710 --> 39:06.905
SO WHEN I ROLL THIS BALL
TO YOU,

39:06.940 --> 39:12.947
I WANT YOU TO SCOOP IT UP
AND DELIVER A PERFECT STRIKE,

39:14.150 --> 39:18.985
KNOWING ALL THE WHILE THAT YOUR
TEAMMATE IS PULLING FOR YOU.

39:28.030 --> 39:31.249
- I DID IT.

39:31.300 --> 39:33.063
I'M OVER THE YIPS.
WHAT?

39:33.100 --> 39:35.933
- I KNEW YOU COULD DO IT, SHAWN!
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU, HA HA!

39:35.970 --> 39:38.530
AHH, YEAH.
[chuckling]

39:41.440 --> 39:43.931
- LITTLE LONG ON THE HUG.

39:43.980 --> 39:45.641
THANK YOU, THOUGH, DOC.

39:45.680 --> 39:47.147

A FIVE-TOOL PLAYER.

40:00.960 --> 40:03.326

THE FACT

40:24.450 --> 40:25.712

40:25.750 --> 40:27.047
WHEN THEY GET OVER
ONE MENTAL BLOCK,

40:27.090 --> 40:28.978
IT SHOWS ITSELF
IN ANOTHER PART OF THEIR GAME.

40:29.020 --> 40:30.885
