WEBVTT

00:07.041 --> 00:11.078
This is your first
time to Denmark?

00:11.079 --> 00:13.980
I've got to be honest, I
usually try to avoid clean,

00:13.981 --> 00:16.149
orderly countries without
massive social countries.

00:16.149 --> 00:17.484
If you're not the poster boy for

00:17.485 --> 00:19.286
the entire country,
you should be.

00:19.287 --> 00:20.154
We go?

00:20.155 --> 00:24.291
Yes, let's go.

00:24.292 --> 00:25.892
You were saddled with the weight

00:25.893 --> 00:26.993
of best restaurant in the world.

00:26.994 --> 00:29.629
This looks totally bogus.

00:29.630 --> 00:30.398
It's fantastic.

00:30.399 --> 00:32.399
You have to work 20 hours a

00:32.400 --> 00:34.767
day in order to achieve this.

00:34.768 --> 00:35.303
They're waiting now.

00:35.303 --> 00:36.237
Let's go.

00:36.238 --> 00:40.840
It's so much mess about... whoo!

00:40.841 --> 00:42.142
It's about bang.

00:42.143 --> 00:46.846
And elements, elements.

00:46.847 --> 00:48.515
What places have you been that

00:48.516 --> 00:54.487
you can compare to Noma?

00:54.488 --> 00:54.822
No place.

00:54.822 --> 00:55.423
It's a whole different world.

00:55.423 --> 00:56.423
Beautiful!

01:46.039 --> 01:49.909
Once upon a time in a land
far, far away, there was a

01:49.910 --> 01:52.545
place, a very special place, a

01:52.546 --> 01:55.582
clean, orderly, and nice place.

01:55.583 --> 01:58.185
Usually I hate clean,
orderly, and nice.

01:58.186 --> 02:06.186
The air smells fresh and
physically fit, statuesque

02:06.860 --> 02:08.928
blondes lined by old
buildings and canals.

02:08.929 --> 02:11.931
I read something
disturbing on my way here.

02:11.932 --> 02:13.833
Apparently Denmark is, like, the

02:13.834 --> 02:15.001
happiest place on earth.

02:15.002 --> 02:16.536
They actually keep
stats on this.

02:16.537 --> 02:18.238
Apparently Denmark is far and

02:18.239 --> 02:20.340
away number one the happiest,

02:20.341 --> 02:22.108
most content place on earth.

02:22.109 --> 02:24.944
Well, the colleges are
the same for everybody.

02:24.945 --> 02:25.779
Free?

02:25.779 --> 02:26.547
Free.

02:26.548 --> 02:27.614
That's un-American.

02:27.615 --> 02:30.450
That's socialism, isn't it?

02:30.451 --> 02:31.051
Yes.

02:31.052 --> 02:37.757
I mean, here, that's
not a bad word.

02:37.758 --> 02:38.958
Okay, they pay, like, 60%
of their earnings in taxes.

02:38.959 --> 02:40.960
But then they do get things
like free health care.

02:40.961 --> 02:44.797
52 weeks maternity
leave on full pay.

02:44.798 --> 02:46.799
When I had my kids two rooms

02:46.800 --> 02:48.635
down, that's where the
future king had his kids.

02:48.636 --> 02:50.637
There's no, like, Beyonce suite.

02:50.638 --> 02:51.572
No.

02:51.572 --> 02:51.972
We're all there.

02:51.972 --> 02:52.906
We're all the same.

02:52.907 --> 02:54.307
That makes people more happy.

02:54.308 --> 03:02.308
That looks like a
nightmare to me.

03:02.583 --> 03:03.950
By the way, it would be

03:03.951 --> 03:06.419
helpful to point out, this
show is not about Denmark.

03:06.420 --> 03:09.055
It's not about Copenhagen.

03:09.056 --> 03:11.324
I'm here for one man.

03:11.325 --> 03:12.392
Follow this way.

03:12.393 --> 03:13.060
And one restaurant.

03:13.061 --> 03:18.765
And then we can start.

03:18.766 --> 03:22.001
Noma is the place where Renee

03:22.002 --> 03:28.608
pretty much changed the
whole world of gastronomy.

03:28.609 --> 03:29.909
For three years in a world, it

03:29.910 --> 03:31.010
was named the world's best

03:31.011 --> 03:33.346
restaurant by a jury of world

03:33.347 --> 03:35.147
chefs and food writers who

03:35.148 --> 03:43.148
presumably know such things.

03:47.528 --> 03:48.796
Whoa.

03:48.962 --> 03:49.863
And so, the question.

03:49.864 --> 03:51.197
How does this nice, down to

03:51.198 --> 03:52.932
earth guy rise to the top of the

03:52.933 --> 03:54.701
food world all while presenting

03:54.702 --> 03:57.003
things that no one could

03:57.004 --> 04:01.007
possibly think would
taste that good?

04:01.008 --> 04:01.809
The flowers.

04:01.810 --> 04:03.710
Oh, man.

04:03.711 --> 04:06.813
I'm not sure, but that's
what I'm here to find out.

04:06.814 --> 04:07.381
The moss?

04:07.381 --> 04:08.215
Yes, chef.

04:08.216 --> 04:10.450
We know that Noma has been

04:10.451 --> 04:11.818
said to be the world's best.

04:11.819 --> 04:16.154
This is a dish that
is 20 man hours.

04:16.156 --> 04:18.224
What we've heard outside of

04:18.225 --> 04:20.059
Denmark is that Rene sources his

04:20.060 --> 04:21.327
ingredients exclusively from the

04:21.329 --> 04:27.334
Nordic region, mostly from
within 60 miles of the

04:27.335 --> 04:27.701
restaurant.

04:27.702 --> 04:29.402
Think about that.

04:29.403 --> 04:33.706
Denmark is not exactly
the Mediterranean.

04:33.707 --> 04:37.977
Summers are short.

04:37.978 --> 04:39.812
What Rene and crew started, what

04:39.813 --> 04:44.651
they're famous for,
is their ingredients.

04:44.652 --> 04:46.085
And color me dubious.

04:46.086 --> 04:51.057
Did you ever eat moss before?

04:51.058 --> 04:53.593
No.

04:53.594 --> 04:54.994
That is incredible.

04:54.995 --> 04:58.365
There's no way that this is
going to look convincingly

04:58.366 --> 04:59.532
delicious on TV.

04:59.533 --> 05:02.168
But it is really delicious.

05:02.169 --> 05:10.169
Alsandro Porcheli is
Italian living in Denmark.

05:10.744 --> 05:13.946
I met Rene in 2004.

05:13.947 --> 05:19.118
Basically the restaurant
was just opened.

05:19.119 --> 05:23.122
Ten years after Noma's
inception, Rene is arguably the

05:23.123 --> 05:25.291
most famous Dane since Hamlet.

05:25.292 --> 05:27.960
So it's happily
ever after, right?

05:27.961 --> 05:29.295
Not quite.

05:29.296 --> 05:32.765
All this happened
actually in Copenhagen.

05:32.766 --> 05:38.638
You have all these rules, these

05:38.639 --> 05:40.973
guidelines where you never
brag about yourself.

05:40.974 --> 05:44.711
The law which discourages

05:44.712 --> 05:45.579
attention-seeking is part and

05:45.580 --> 05:48.214
parcel of living in Denmark.

05:48.215 --> 05:49.116
Danes who think too big are

05:49.117 --> 05:50.817
often cut down by their peers.

05:50.818 --> 05:52.985
It's hard to really make an

05:52.986 --> 05:54.887
effort, and if you stand out too

05:54.888 --> 05:56.489
much, you know, get
off your horse.

05:56.490 --> 05:59.158
Okay, so let's say you start

05:59.159 --> 06:00.593
a restaurant and you announce

06:00.594 --> 06:02.128
right away, this restaurant is

06:02.129 --> 06:05.832
going to be different than
anybody else's restaurant.

06:05.833 --> 06:08.435
Are people mean originally?

06:08.436 --> 06:10.437
Do they talk... about you?

06:10.438 --> 06:14.607
I mean, how much foul language
can I use on this show?

06:14.608 --> 06:19.679
We very quickly became the
big band of the seal...

06:19.680 --> 06:22.348
People can be so cruel.

06:22.349 --> 06:25.251
Do Danes like this place?

06:25.252 --> 06:25.486
No?

06:25.487 --> 06:28.320
It's got the attention
of the whole world.

06:28.321 --> 06:32.759
Yeah, exactly.

06:32.760 --> 06:36.663
To tell the truth, food
nerds, captains of industry,

06:36.664 --> 06:37.531
celebrities, you name it have

06:37.532 --> 06:42.334
been flocking here for years.

06:42.335 --> 06:47.607
Some waiting months for a
reservation in a 45-seat

06:47.608 --> 06:48.542
restaurant.

06:48.543 --> 06:50.543
Do we have the leek?

06:50.544 --> 06:52.545
It's marinating.

06:52.546 --> 06:59.852
All of this green snow
is made from leaves.

06:59.853 --> 07:00.788
That's good.

07:00.789 --> 07:01.888
You don't notice it.

07:01.889 --> 07:04.056
You notice the flavor.

07:04.057 --> 07:05.692
That's delicious.

07:05.693 --> 07:07.359
That's really intensely... like

07:07.360 --> 07:15.360
I've never tasted a green
vegetable that good.

07:17.070 --> 07:19.706
You see lawns, people sit
down, the sun is out.

07:19.707 --> 07:22.341
The birds are singing.

07:22.342 --> 07:26.078
This is where happiness
was invented.

07:26.079 --> 07:29.516
Tubali gardens, it is said,

07:29.517 --> 07:33.686
is the second-oldest
amusement park in the world.

07:33.687 --> 07:35.655
Watch the pantomime that
is hundreds of years old.

07:35.656 --> 07:37.590
I've only been here once
with my kids, actually.

07:37.591 --> 07:41.928
I work all the time,
unfortunately.

07:41.929 --> 07:42.830
This is usually the place where

07:42.831 --> 07:44.363
young kids take
their first date.

07:44.364 --> 07:46.566
How old is this thing?

07:46.567 --> 07:47.400
I don't know, man.

07:47.401 --> 07:48.768
This is made for kids.

07:48.769 --> 07:54.574
Does it feel a bit wobbly?

07:54.575 --> 07:55.875
Copenhagen is dangerous, too.

07:55.876 --> 07:57.443
Yeah, right.

07:57.444 --> 07:57.711
Whoa.

07:57.712 --> 07:58.945
There you go.

07:58.946 --> 08:00.212
This is not bad.

08:00.213 --> 08:01.413
There you see.

08:01.414 --> 08:04.450
It's a little tiny cart.

08:04.451 --> 08:06.686
It's not huge, is it?

08:06.687 --> 08:07.720
Squished in the middle.

08:07.721 --> 08:11.023
It's like Singapore.

08:11.024 --> 08:11.859
All dense together.

08:11.860 --> 08:12.892
No death penalty.

08:12.893 --> 08:20.299
Only the public humiliation.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.301
Oh, here we go.

08:22.302 --> 08:24.370
Firearms, apparently,
it's okay here.

08:24.371 --> 08:25.605
You know, I've actually never

08:25.606 --> 08:27.139
fired a firearm in my life.

08:27.140 --> 08:27.941
Really?

08:27.942 --> 08:31.377
And I've never driven a car.

08:31.378 --> 08:31.979
You've never driven a car?

08:31.980 --> 08:33.479
Never driven a car.

08:33.480 --> 08:34.047
Okay.

08:34.048 --> 08:35.214
This will be empowering.

08:35.215 --> 08:39.785
This could change
your whole life.

08:39.787 --> 08:46.092
You don't need to tell
him, he's American.

08:46.093 --> 08:47.159
Is this a competition?

08:47.160 --> 08:51.898
Call it what you like.

08:51.899 --> 08:59.899
All right.

09:02.509 --> 09:07.847
Oh, this is exciting.

09:07.848 --> 09:09.982
We definitely have a winner.

09:09.983 --> 09:10.350
Oh, my god.

09:10.351 --> 09:11.684
Not a single one?

09:11.685 --> 09:16.522
That's what we call
a nice grouping.

09:16.523 --> 09:20.492
This is like public
school, shooting range.

09:20.493 --> 09:22.328
After this, we're
going to steal a car.

09:22.329 --> 09:24.196
I'll teach you to drive.

09:24.197 --> 09:26.365
Come on, guys.

09:26.366 --> 09:27.767
They're waiting.

09:27.768 --> 09:30.202
Familiar with this one at all?

09:30.203 --> 09:31.203
No.

09:31.204 --> 09:33.272
It's served around
Christmas time.

09:33.273 --> 09:35.441
You've got a little fish
rammed right through.

09:35.442 --> 09:36.209
I love it.

09:36.210 --> 09:37.443
Isn't this tweet?

09:37.444 --> 09:42.214
There's a pickled
cucumber in the middle.

09:42.215 --> 09:44.283
That's great.

09:44.284 --> 09:45.685
Very traditional flavors.

09:45.686 --> 09:47.053
There's all these old school

09:47.054 --> 09:48.721
restaurants that have been
here hundreds of years.

09:48.722 --> 09:55.862
The herring, smoked fish,
the traditional stuff.

09:55.863 --> 09:57.697
There we go.

09:57.698 --> 09:59.331
Thank you, my good man.

09:59.332 --> 10:03.402
Welcome to the happiest
place... on earth.

10:03.403 --> 10:04.237
On earth.

10:04.238 --> 10:07.073
There we go.

10:07.074 --> 10:10.877
Smoked eel.

10:10.878 --> 10:12.544
Pickled herring.

10:12.545 --> 10:14.580
These tiny little shrimps, one

10:14.581 --> 10:15.715
of the few seasonal offerings

10:15.716 --> 10:17.249
that Danes look forward to.

10:17.250 --> 10:20.186
Our eating traditions
aren't that big here.

10:20.187 --> 10:22.154
Historically, we've
eaten for survival.

10:22.155 --> 10:24.824
It was fuel to us.

10:24.825 --> 10:27.026
Not exactly the most fun bunch.

10:27.027 --> 10:30.029
It was sinful to take too
much pleasure in food.

10:30.030 --> 10:32.031
You're sitting at the table,

10:32.032 --> 10:33.499
like oh, my god, that's so good.

10:33.500 --> 10:34.067
It's delicious.

10:34.068 --> 10:37.670
You're already going down a

10:37.671 --> 10:39.706
slippery slope of who knows what

10:39.707 --> 10:41.107
other kinds of behaviors.

10:41.108 --> 10:42.842
My father is an immigrant here.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.543
I'm not even a full Dane.

10:44.544 --> 10:47.579
Your father was... the
former Yugoslavia.

10:47.580 --> 10:50.116
And left Yugoslavia at what age?

10:50.117 --> 10:50.718
14.

10:50.719 --> 10:52.685
People make fun of me when I say

10:52.686 --> 10:54.754
I've never driven a car.

10:54.755 --> 10:58.958
I never had a Coca-Cola
until I was, like, 17.

10:58.959 --> 11:00.793
It just wasn't in a small little

11:00.794 --> 11:03.029
village where there's two cars.

11:03.030 --> 11:05.464
The first food I have is also

11:05.465 --> 11:06.966
from there, and
it was my father.

11:06.967 --> 11:08.467
And the day before we had been

11:08.468 --> 11:10.469
into the mountain
picking chestnuts.

11:10.470 --> 11:12.604
And I remember it so vividly as

11:12.605 --> 11:16.642
a little child, I saw my
father roasting chestnuts.

11:16.643 --> 11:22.548
And then I start hearing
all these things popping.

11:22.549 --> 11:24.316
20 minutes later, they were in a

11:24.317 --> 11:26.118
bowl and my aunt poured milk

11:26.119 --> 11:27.419
that she had just taken from the

11:27.420 --> 11:30.089
cow and we had that
for breakfast.

11:30.090 --> 11:33.492
It was so natural that we
went to the mountain for the

11:33.493 --> 11:36.495
chestnuts, you grew
your food yourself.

11:36.496 --> 11:37.563
These sort of experiences

11:37.564 --> 11:38.798
growing up, they really shaped

11:38.799 --> 11:42.569
the type of cook I am today.

11:52.579 --> 11:55.782
So now you have a generation

11:55.783 --> 11:57.283
of young cooks like myself all

11:57.284 --> 11:59.251
over town looking for
the flavor of a region.

11:59.252 --> 12:01.453
What is the flavor?

12:01.454 --> 12:02.022
What are the ingredients we

12:02.023 --> 12:03.155
have, and how do we combine them

12:03.156 --> 12:04.623
in a way that tells something of

12:04.624 --> 12:09.528
where you are in the world?

12:09.529 --> 12:12.765
Between me and nature,
there's not so much love.

12:12.766 --> 12:16.302
Nature is where bugs live.

12:16.303 --> 12:18.537
But I'm learning reluctantly

12:18.538 --> 12:21.673
over time how much
I've been missing.

12:21.674 --> 12:23.675
Rene's proclivity to scrounge

12:23.676 --> 12:26.045
around for flavorful
stuff that grows wild...

12:26.046 --> 12:27.814
Welcome to the beach.

12:27.815 --> 12:29.315
Pretty much kick started the

12:29.316 --> 12:32.484
restaurant world's now widely

12:32.485 --> 12:34.153
emulated practice of foraging.

12:34.154 --> 12:37.056
You see all this?

12:37.057 --> 12:37.324
Grass.

12:37.325 --> 12:41.527
But these are succulents.

12:41.528 --> 12:43.896
Rene's thing, since the

12:43.897 --> 12:47.199
beginning, how to put
in what's around you.

12:47.200 --> 12:50.536
To be a 19th century naturalist,
you're going to have

12:50.537 --> 12:51.338
to do this.

12:51.339 --> 12:55.207
Yes, a naturalist.

12:55.208 --> 13:00.179
Chew on this.

13:00.180 --> 13:00.713
Taste delightful?

13:00.714 --> 13:02.014
Yes, it's wonderful.

13:02.015 --> 13:04.250
Disguised as grass.

13:04.251 --> 13:05.218
Here, here, here.

13:05.218 --> 13:06.153
It's everywhere.

13:06.154 --> 13:14.154
Good to go.

13:15.362 --> 13:18.064
So, I know these ingredients,

13:18.065 --> 13:21.667
we were plucking
them just today.

13:21.668 --> 13:22.335
Yes.

13:22.335 --> 13:23.070
Wow.

13:23.071 --> 13:26.772
This will be the future.

13:26.773 --> 13:28.374
Let's go forage, guys.

13:28.375 --> 13:30.242
Come on, kids.

13:30.243 --> 13:32.044
There you go.

13:32.045 --> 13:33.545
Sea beans.

13:33.546 --> 13:34.713
Salty, juicy, crunchy.

13:34.714 --> 13:37.549
If I were looking at this
home, I would very much be

13:37.550 --> 13:39.919
thinking, come on, man.

13:39.920 --> 13:40.387
It's grass.

13:40.387 --> 13:41.354
It's green stuff.

13:41.355 --> 13:42.388
It all tastes the say.

13:42.389 --> 13:43.522
It totally doesn't.

13:43.523 --> 13:44.924
It totally doesn't.

13:44.925 --> 13:46.959
Is some of this stuff poison?

13:46.960 --> 13:47.427
Yeah.

13:47.428 --> 13:50.762
Have you ever eaten
something that... oh, yeah.

13:50.763 --> 13:52.932
On-the-spot diarrhea.

13:52.933 --> 13:53.233
Really?

13:53.233 --> 13:53.800
Yeah.

13:53.801 --> 13:55.601
The dark side of foraging.

13:55.602 --> 13:57.970
Two fish heads.

13:57.971 --> 13:59.405
Growing your own food,
finding your own food.

13:59.406 --> 13:59.973
Yeah.

13:59.974 --> 14:02.741
That was life in Macedonia.

14:02.742 --> 14:03.310
Yeah.

14:03.311 --> 14:09.781
But for a lot of people
now, it is an affectation.

14:09.782 --> 14:12.751
The worst meals are people
following a culinary trend.

14:12.752 --> 14:15.087
They'll say there's an edible.

14:15.088 --> 14:19.758
But it tastes like... but it's

14:19.759 --> 14:27.299
edible and it will go on
the fish no matter what.

14:27.300 --> 14:32.004
Oher, okay.

14:32.005 --> 14:35.241
You just pick off
every little bit.

14:35.242 --> 14:37.509
But I think even at its most

14:37.510 --> 14:39.611
ludicrous manifestation, surely

14:39.612 --> 14:40.947
it is a positive thing that

14:40.948 --> 14:44.516
people are actually starting to

14:44.517 --> 14:46.652
look around and see,
where it grows...

14:46.653 --> 14:48.087
It still is good.

14:48.088 --> 14:49.688
People are being connected
to the place they're in.

14:49.689 --> 14:51.823
What's edible and what's not.

14:51.824 --> 14:55.261
What is there to eat.

14:55.262 --> 14:56.795
This is beach mustard.

14:56.796 --> 14:58.330
In three weeks, this is gone.

14:58.331 --> 15:02.935
New things come up.

15:02.936 --> 15:06.338
It's sour dough bread.

15:06.339 --> 15:08.807
It's butter that has not
been churned all the way.

15:08.808 --> 15:10.176
It's called virgin butter.

15:10.177 --> 15:10.978
Oh, god.

15:10.979 --> 15:12.211
This is amazing, huh?

15:12.212 --> 15:14.113
Butter like this where you

15:14.114 --> 15:15.948
can pretty much taste
what the cow ate.

15:15.949 --> 15:17.483
Anyone who's milked a cow, this

15:17.484 --> 15:18.650
is a flavor of childhood.

15:18.651 --> 15:20.819
There aren't a lot of people

15:20.820 --> 15:22.955
left where I came from
who milked a cow.

15:22.956 --> 15:26.025
This has become more important
to what these guys are

15:26.026 --> 15:26.293
doing.

15:26.294 --> 15:34.294
A relationship also that
they had with the farmers.

15:38.338 --> 15:43.009
This is Soren's farm, but
we always say our farm.

15:43.010 --> 15:43.576
We feel like it's our place.

15:43.577 --> 15:47.179
Soren is his primary
supplier of vegetables.

15:47.180 --> 15:50.016
You see all the shells?

15:50.017 --> 15:52.718
These are shellfish.

15:52.719 --> 15:55.187
Like Rene, he's not your
ordinary Dane and his farm is

15:55.188 --> 15:57.023
unlike the others around here.

15:57.024 --> 16:00.159
This used to be monoculture.

16:00.160 --> 16:00.860
Yep.

16:00.861 --> 16:01.927
Just carrots.

16:01.928 --> 16:04.030
Now what are you growing?

16:04.031 --> 16:07.366
Between 120 and 170
different things.

16:07.367 --> 16:09.668
True, there are tractors and

16:09.669 --> 16:11.870
rows where potatoes
and carrots grow.

16:11.871 --> 16:16.542
But much of what's happening
here is a mix of wild and

16:16.543 --> 16:16.876
cultivated.

16:16.877 --> 16:20.512
This is wild Angelica.

16:20.513 --> 16:25.751
That's chives and the purple
flowers, wild onions.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.719
Let's grow some for next year.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.721
First time you come up here, you

16:29.722 --> 16:31.923
go into this, like
oh, flower garden.

16:31.924 --> 16:36.795
You say no, no, no,
this is the leek field.

16:36.796 --> 16:38.130
Touching them like
they're jewels.

16:38.131 --> 16:40.232
They are jewels.

16:40.233 --> 16:48.233
Let's grab a bunch of
these for lunch, no?

16:48.408 --> 16:50.542
The pressure to provide year

16:50.543 --> 16:51.710
in, year out what you know is

16:51.711 --> 16:53.579
going to sell and what
the market demands.

16:53.580 --> 16:56.382
Do you mind grabbing a
few of these plants?

16:56.383 --> 16:58.484
They're going to grow up,
so don't take the root.

16:58.485 --> 17:01.220
It's very, very hard for a

17:01.221 --> 17:02.954
small guy to say I'm not going

17:02.955 --> 17:05.424
to grow carrots anymore, I'm

17:05.425 --> 17:06.558
going to grow interesting things

17:06.559 --> 17:08.460
and grow them as well as I can.

17:08.461 --> 17:09.661
This is pretty much
a first for me.

17:09.662 --> 17:10.929
This is the first time you

17:10.930 --> 17:13.165
fall to your knees
for a green plant?

17:13.165 --> 17:13.933
Yeah.

17:13.934 --> 17:15.601
How long for leeks?

17:15.602 --> 17:20.771
Do you think we'll ever reach
a point where guys like

17:20.772 --> 17:22.273
Supervissoren will be
in a very good place?

17:22.275 --> 17:23.342
I think if we cut the middle

17:23.343 --> 17:26.612
men, the producers, the farmer,

17:26.613 --> 17:29.148
to talk directly with
a guy like Rene.

17:29.149 --> 17:31.683
Nobody ever teaches you it's

17:31.684 --> 17:33.452
with these people
that grow the food.

17:33.453 --> 17:36.122
You're never taught that as
a cook, which is strange.

17:36.123 --> 17:38.457
Can we have another leek that

17:38.458 --> 17:43.195
looks more similar in
size to that one, please?

17:43.196 --> 17:43.863
I think also, respect to you

17:43.864 --> 17:45.764
all chefs, how should you know

17:45.765 --> 17:47.166
anything about this landscape?

17:47.167 --> 17:48.967
I've been here for 30 years and

17:48.968 --> 17:54.306
I just know small, tiny parts.

17:54.307 --> 17:55.874
So we just scoop it up.

17:55.875 --> 17:57.709
I think we picked
these yesterday.

17:57.710 --> 17:58.445
Oh yeah?

17:58.446 --> 18:01.313
Oh, man.

18:01.314 --> 18:09.314
That is the meatiest
vegetable I've ever had.

18:09.622 --> 18:13.359
Maybe we'll cook this for
lunch spiced with a tartar.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.161
Chop that up with the freshly

18:15.162 --> 18:19.531
slaughtered meat, one
of Soren's cows.

18:19.532 --> 18:21.833
What else?

18:21.834 --> 18:23.235
The asparagus?

18:23.236 --> 18:25.737
Yes, let's do that.

18:25.738 --> 18:26.139
I'm hungry.

18:26.140 --> 18:28.907
Asparagus.

18:28.908 --> 18:31.210
Beautiful.

18:31.211 --> 18:33.912
Let's go.

18:33.913 --> 18:39.851
Just one dollop, okay?

18:39.852 --> 18:41.687
Do not eat that branch.

18:41.688 --> 18:42.489
Okay.

18:42.490 --> 18:46.358
Underneath is a small pile of

18:46.359 --> 18:50.829
tender... asparagus sauce
and fresh green paste.

18:50.830 --> 18:53.532
That is incredible.

18:53.533 --> 18:54.866
Wow.

18:54.867 --> 18:58.036
The flavor of this, huh?

18:58.037 --> 19:04.710
So this is actually beer
made from asparagus.

19:04.711 --> 19:05.412
It's tasty.

19:05.413 --> 19:08.380
What was the name of the cow?

19:08.381 --> 19:11.917
76377330.

19:11.918 --> 19:14.119
Chef, do you want
to do the tartar?

19:14.120 --> 19:16.522
What are you thinking,
just hack up the meat?

19:16.523 --> 19:19.057
Hack up the meat.

19:19.058 --> 19:20.459
It already looks good.

19:20.460 --> 19:25.464
I'm going to go on the
asparagus and the leeks.

19:25.465 --> 19:27.399
Clean them up, grill then.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.568
Do you want to do
a potato salad?

19:29.569 --> 19:30.403
Yeah.

19:30.404 --> 19:33.305
What you would put
on the tartar.

19:33.306 --> 19:34.706
Wild onions.

19:34.707 --> 19:38.043
A bit of this horseradish.

19:38.044 --> 19:39.878
That's the chives.

19:39.879 --> 19:40.979
Chive flowers.

19:40.980 --> 19:41.781
Okay.

19:41.782 --> 19:46.418
A little salt on the leek
and a little cheese?

19:46.419 --> 19:47.453
Yes.

19:47.454 --> 19:48.887
That's the Angelica.

19:48.888 --> 19:56.888
Take all these flowers
and we mix that in.

19:56.929 --> 19:59.998
Some vinegar.

19:59.999 --> 20:00.600
Done.

20:00.601 --> 20:04.270
Didn't take us ten minutes,
but we have four courses.

20:04.271 --> 20:07.005
This is like three
Michelin stars.

20:07.006 --> 20:08.073
Oh, yeah.

20:08.074 --> 20:10.442
Oh, man.

20:10.443 --> 20:12.311
Perfect.

20:12.312 --> 20:13.979
Look at that.

20:13.980 --> 20:14.681
Wow.

20:14.682 --> 20:16.482
Wow, wow, wow.

20:16.483 --> 20:17.983
And that egg.

20:17.984 --> 20:19.418
What an egg.

20:19.419 --> 20:20.819
Do you eat like
this all the time?

20:20.820 --> 20:22.421
I bring my kids up here.

20:22.422 --> 20:24.122
All the staff comes here often.

20:24.123 --> 20:26.292
This becomes your reference

20:26.293 --> 20:28.794
frame for how fresh an
asparagus should be?

20:28.795 --> 20:29.662
Just harvest.

20:29.663 --> 20:30.962
Just cooked.

20:30.963 --> 20:31.698
Just eaten.

20:31.699 --> 20:32.964
I think a place like this, in

20:32.965 --> 20:35.467
addition to being the best
restaurant in the world and

20:35.468 --> 20:37.669
whatever else, it offers a real

20:37.670 --> 20:39.705
possibility that there is food

20:39.706 --> 20:40.806
around that with a little

20:40.807 --> 20:42.974
effort, or a lot of effort, you

20:42.975 --> 20:45.411
can make into something
really delicious.

20:45.412 --> 20:50.982
That is the hard thing.

20:50.983 --> 20:53.519
To change the way people
think about food.

20:53.520 --> 20:55.321
Thank you for joining.

20:55.322 --> 20:56.289
Thank you, chef.

20:56.290 --> 20:58.257
It's magnificent.

21:08.401 --> 21:09.401
There are always going to be

21:09.402 --> 21:10.636
some people out there who hate

21:10.637 --> 21:11.970
the very idea of your existence.

21:11.971 --> 21:12.472
Yeah.

21:12.473 --> 21:20.473
From the very minute they
even think about you.

21:24.484 --> 21:25.851
There's a Danish expression for

21:25.852 --> 21:26.852
not wanting to stand out.

21:26.853 --> 21:27.320
Yeah.

21:27.321 --> 21:30.756
Not wanting to talk
about yourself.

21:30.757 --> 21:35.594
The law of yenta.

21:35.595 --> 21:36.429
Yeast broth.

21:36.429 --> 21:37.229
It's beautiful.

21:37.230 --> 21:41.433
Here we are ten years ago,
we're opening, we're saying

21:41.434 --> 21:44.436
we're going to try
something else.

21:44.437 --> 21:47.272
Stuff like that in that
time was just unheard of.

21:47.273 --> 21:48.240
It was beyond stupid.

21:48.241 --> 21:49.441
And why do you even try?

21:49.442 --> 21:56.748
Why are you fiddling
with stupid concepts?

21:56.749 --> 21:59.084
This is very complex.

21:59.085 --> 22:01.186
I know in the beginning, a lot

22:01.187 --> 22:03.288
of Danes were calling him...

22:03.289 --> 22:05.391
They were laughing at him.

22:05.392 --> 22:07.859
It's a very new thing.

22:07.860 --> 22:10.396
It's not something they
have in Italy, France.

22:10.397 --> 22:12.063
Here it's a different story.

22:12.064 --> 22:13.231
You have a huge part of people

22:13.232 --> 22:18.303
that are still so much in
love with the old world.

22:18.304 --> 22:20.305
I mean, I've even been told that

22:20.306 --> 22:22.073
I have fascist tendencies.

22:22.074 --> 22:25.143
There's been op-eds written in

22:25.144 --> 22:26.878
Danish papers linking what we do

22:26.879 --> 22:28.380
at the restaurant to some of the

22:28.381 --> 22:32.217
most horrible moments
in recent history.

22:32.218 --> 22:35.921
This is the tail of the lobster,

22:35.922 --> 22:37.989
with a little bit of the
head juices underneath.

22:37.990 --> 22:40.826
Use your hands.

22:40.827 --> 22:41.827
I will.

22:41.828 --> 22:43.829
It's luxurious.

22:43.830 --> 22:45.296
So how is it changing?

22:45.297 --> 22:46.165
That's what's interesting.

22:46.166 --> 22:52.103
In ten years, it's really gone

22:52.104 --> 22:54.172
from, you know... to igniting a

22:54.173 --> 22:55.841
new confidence in this city in

22:55.842 --> 22:59.978
this part of the world
that I never grew up with.

22:59.979 --> 23:01.680
A possible forebearer to this

23:01.681 --> 23:04.850
new challenging of the status

23:04.851 --> 23:05.518
quo can be found right in the

23:05.519 --> 23:13.519
heart of this great-laced
Danish capital.

23:15.762 --> 23:23.535
The well established
hippie squatte squatters.

23:23.536 --> 23:25.604
But there are some
interesting features.

23:25.605 --> 23:26.605
There's no government to intrude

23:26.606 --> 23:27.706
on your personal freedom.

23:27.707 --> 23:31.843
You're free to behave as

23:31.844 --> 23:33.044
eccentric fashion as you wish.

23:33.045 --> 23:34.713
If you want to spend your day

23:34.714 --> 23:37.015
talking to a tree, you can do

23:37.016 --> 23:38.550
that without being frowned upon.

23:38.551 --> 23:41.453
They are in local
government, such as it is.

23:41.454 --> 23:43.555
He has been here
for some 40 years.

23:43.556 --> 23:45.524
It was a military area that was

23:45.525 --> 23:47.158
abandoned and then occupied by

23:47.159 --> 23:48.894
squatters and hippies, despite

23:48.895 --> 23:50.996
the fact that the different
governments didn't really

23:50.997 --> 23:52.998
appreciate what was going on

23:52.999 --> 23:53.999
here, nobody actually had the

23:54.000 --> 23:56.468
will or strength
to put people out.

23:56.469 --> 23:59.037
Who makes up the traction?

23:59.038 --> 23:59.839
We do.

23:59.840 --> 24:02.641
What about the essentials,
electric, water.

24:02.642 --> 24:05.877
We buy it from providers.

24:05.878 --> 24:06.978
We pay only one bill.

24:06.979 --> 24:08.480
But I like the fact that my

24:08.481 --> 24:09.715
kids get to walk around the

24:09.716 --> 24:10.882
streets without worrying about

24:10.883 --> 24:13.418
being run over by a car.

24:13.419 --> 24:15.687
There's no cars running
in the streets.

24:15.688 --> 24:18.223
It's like a little village.

24:18.224 --> 24:18.925
It's very secure.

24:18.926 --> 24:23.729
Are you a hippie?

24:23.730 --> 24:25.030
He is.

24:25.031 --> 24:26.932
Two eggs smoking now.

24:26.933 --> 24:29.000
Right down there, we have

24:29.001 --> 24:30.869
pusher street, probably
the most famous part.

24:30.870 --> 24:35.440
The green section, right?

24:35.441 --> 24:36.042
Weed, hash oil.

24:36.043 --> 24:37.909
I would never do that as a

24:37.910 --> 24:39.110
responsible journalist, but I'm

24:39.111 --> 24:42.113
interested in investigating it.

24:42.114 --> 24:46.852
It is a beloved
institution here.

24:46.853 --> 24:51.557
You are free to try an array
of cannabis products.

24:51.558 --> 24:52.858
Theoretically, marijuana is,

24:52.859 --> 24:54.526
like, not legal in Denmark.

24:54.527 --> 24:56.227
But there's a great tolerance

24:56.228 --> 24:58.063
for marijuana here and I think

24:58.064 --> 25:00.566
that's because it
isn't really harmful.

25:00.567 --> 25:04.770
People who smoke too much,
maybe they pass out.

25:04.771 --> 25:07.405
Right.

25:07.406 --> 25:08.574
Quail egg cooked.

25:08.575 --> 25:08.808
Wow.

25:08.809 --> 25:11.943
That's like the
greatest thing ever.

25:11.944 --> 25:19.944
I want more of those.

25:21.988 --> 25:24.255
So there's nobody in charge.

25:24.256 --> 25:24.991
I am.

25:24.992 --> 25:26.658
I'm in charge.

25:26.659 --> 25:27.393
Yeah.

25:27.394 --> 25:28.994
The only problem is
everybody else is, too.

25:28.995 --> 25:30.962
It seems utopia.

25:30.963 --> 25:32.163
We have the same problems as

25:32.164 --> 25:36.001
anybody, but we try to solve
them in a different way.

25:36.002 --> 25:37.268
One of the ways we try to

25:37.269 --> 25:38.837
solve the sort of challenges by

25:38.838 --> 25:40.438
embracing people
as much as we can.

25:40.439 --> 25:46.978
And trying to make space
as much as we can.

25:46.979 --> 25:49.815
Do we have two peas
ready for table four?

25:49.816 --> 25:53.819
Can I go over that now?

25:53.820 --> 25:55.520
Yes.

25:55.521 --> 25:57.188
Extraordinary.

25:57.189 --> 25:58.590
I was reading something that's

25:58.591 --> 26:00.592
very un-American in its concept,

26:00.593 --> 26:03.929
which is don't be
afraid to fail.

26:03.930 --> 26:07.198
When we did this issue, to us

26:07.199 --> 26:07.867
it was a very big moment.

26:07.868 --> 26:09.334
We burnt it by mistake.

26:09.335 --> 26:12.203
We thought okay, it's a mistake.

26:12.204 --> 26:12.805
Let's see what happens.

26:12.805 --> 26:13.673
We cooked it.

26:13.674 --> 26:15.373
Then we had a new spice.

26:15.374 --> 26:18.209
That's indescribably delicious.

26:18.210 --> 26:19.611
All cook books, particularly

26:19.612 --> 26:20.812
American cook books, are written

26:20.813 --> 26:21.847
from the point of view that if

26:21.848 --> 26:25.216
you only follow this recipe,
it will turn out great.

26:25.217 --> 26:26.018
You're safe.

26:26.019 --> 26:27.352
This is what we try to talk

26:27.353 --> 26:29.554
about every day in the kitchen

26:29.555 --> 26:34.960
with the cooks on
Saturday night projects.

26:34.961 --> 26:36.561
Apparently this is when you

26:36.562 --> 26:38.797
invite members of your crew to

26:38.798 --> 26:41.867
put up a new dish for comment.

26:41.868 --> 26:44.002
After each grueling workweek

26:44.003 --> 26:45.036
concludes, cooks from every

26:45.037 --> 26:46.905
level of the brigade stay late

26:46.906 --> 26:49.708
to submit their newest
culinary ideas.

26:49.709 --> 26:50.677
Everybody's in on this?

26:50.677 --> 26:51.510
Everybody's in.

26:51.511 --> 26:55.747
This could be a very
uncomfortable... you're heading

26:55.748 --> 26:56.382
it out.

26:56.383 --> 26:59.384
This forum is about failure.

26:59.385 --> 26:59.551
Yes.

26:59.552 --> 27:01.019
So let's see what you got.

27:01.020 --> 27:04.489
Luke, go for it.

27:04.490 --> 27:05.091
In no point in my career

27:05.092 --> 27:06.424
would I have wanted to subject

27:06.425 --> 27:08.960
myself to this kind
of mass scrutiny.

27:08.961 --> 27:10.495
But watch.

27:10.496 --> 27:11.363
It's not bad.

27:11.364 --> 27:15.935
It can be bad.

27:16.769 --> 27:17.936
Fermented apple tea.

27:17.937 --> 27:23.041
This one I did with razor clam

27:23.042 --> 27:27.946
and some cammomile as well.

27:27.947 --> 27:32.250
It just ferments in
water and 2% salt.

27:32.251 --> 27:34.720
This is fondue
with brown butter.

27:34.721 --> 27:37.288
What we have here, ice
cream with some barley.

27:37.289 --> 27:44.262
Mushroom ice cream and
fermented barley sauce.

27:44.263 --> 27:46.798
Personally I'm not getting

27:46.799 --> 27:48.767
what they brought to the party.

27:48.768 --> 27:49.801
It's a little sweet.

27:49.802 --> 27:51.469
With this broth,
it's quite sweet.

27:51.470 --> 27:53.972
So it becomes very
one-dimensional.

27:53.973 --> 27:57.375
Why can't you do that
for your next project?

27:57.376 --> 27:58.609
Dry salt versus brine salt.

27:58.610 --> 28:02.447
He uses things I
would never use.

28:02.448 --> 28:03.315
And it tastes good.

28:03.316 --> 28:04.415
I like it.

28:04.416 --> 28:07.152
Given a choice of a
traditional dessert and this,

28:07.153 --> 28:09.087
I'm very happy with this.

28:09.088 --> 28:11.991
I think it's delicious.

28:12.925 --> 28:16.627
Thank you.

28:16.628 --> 28:21.967
Who's next?

28:21.968 --> 28:22.168
Oh!

28:22.169 --> 28:25.570
So here we have a dish of
strawberries and cream.

28:25.571 --> 28:27.305
I just decided to go on my bike

28:27.306 --> 28:28.740
and see what I could get.

28:28.741 --> 28:30.008
All the flowers that are here,

28:30.009 --> 28:32.744
the lady let me pick
them in her garden.

28:32.745 --> 28:36.114
So strawberries that are
pickled in Rose vinegar.

28:36.115 --> 28:37.849
The base has been infused with

28:37.850 --> 28:44.089
burnt roses and Rose pollen.

28:44.090 --> 28:49.829
Do we just clap or... yes.

28:54.834 --> 28:57.502
And that might well
end up on the menu?

28:57.503 --> 28:58.137
No.

28:58.138 --> 29:00.772
This is not about putting
things on the menu.

29:00.773 --> 29:04.209
I mean, if somebody makes
a masterpiece, it's their

29:04.210 --> 29:04.510
masterpiece.

29:04.510 --> 29:04.877
Really?

29:04.878 --> 29:06.211
Yeah, yeah.

29:06.212 --> 29:07.013
Of course.

29:07.014 --> 29:09.047
Isn't it your hysterical

29:09.048 --> 29:10.281
imperative as the chef to take

29:10.282 --> 29:11.682
his good work and innovation and

29:11.683 --> 29:14.652
put it on the menu and take
credit for it as your own?

29:14.653 --> 29:17.388
I mean, that's the way it's
been done for centuries.

29:17.389 --> 29:19.724
This is not the point here.

29:19.725 --> 29:22.360
The pursuit of enlightenment

29:22.361 --> 29:23.728
and knowledge is its own reward?

29:23.729 --> 29:24.863
To me, yes.

29:24.864 --> 29:27.365
Is that it?

29:27.366 --> 29:28.500
Cheers, everybody.

29:38.510 --> 29:41.379
Table four is being cleared.

29:41.380 --> 29:42.713
Let's start dressing.

29:42.714 --> 29:43.382
They're waiting.

29:43.383 --> 29:44.415
Yes, chef.

29:44.416 --> 29:47.385
Now I travel a lot.

29:47.386 --> 29:50.088
You know, I want to be
number one in the world.

29:50.089 --> 29:52.891
I was in Mexico, the Yucatan.

29:52.892 --> 29:57.062
They don't even know how
to make a tortilla.

29:57.063 --> 29:59.164
They lose touch with
what tradition is.

29:59.165 --> 30:00.866
That looks good.

30:00.867 --> 30:06.237
It's good for you to try
this, the herring, the rye

30:06.238 --> 30:09.540
bread, the traditional stuff.

30:09.541 --> 30:12.177
When you grow up as a cook here,

30:12.178 --> 30:15.613
you don't see it as an
inspiration for your future

30:15.614 --> 30:16.248
endeavors.

30:16.249 --> 30:20.085
The next thing we serve
you is flat bread.

30:20.086 --> 30:20.586
Very traditional here.

30:20.587 --> 30:27.425
We spice ours with chutes
of spruce and oak tree.

30:27.426 --> 30:29.294
This is amazing.

30:29.295 --> 30:29.761
Amazing.

30:29.762 --> 30:31.029
Sophistication.

30:31.030 --> 30:33.464
Something that is so down
to earth flavor-wise.

30:33.465 --> 30:34.565
No doubt about it.

30:34.566 --> 30:42.566
That seems both really
classic and totally new.

30:46.745 --> 30:47.778
Cheers.

30:47.779 --> 30:50.081
I'm learning, Danes may be

30:50.082 --> 30:56.955
stiff, but they sure as
hell know how to drink.

30:56.956 --> 31:00.225
Nils is a Danish
renaissance man.

31:00.226 --> 31:05.763
Drinker, sailor, charter tour
boat operator, musician.

31:05.764 --> 31:08.099
I have known him from
the absolute beginning.

31:08.100 --> 31:09.634
When Noma... can we start now?

31:09.635 --> 31:10.936
Yeah, we're going.

31:10.937 --> 31:12.503
Well, what did you think of him

31:12.504 --> 31:13.604
when you first met him?

31:13.605 --> 31:15.907
I saw an ordinary man.

31:15.908 --> 31:17.976
He fight for what
he think about.

31:17.977 --> 31:19.010
He had a vision.

31:19.011 --> 31:20.912
Yeah, a vision.

31:20.913 --> 31:24.615
And fight for this.

31:24.616 --> 31:27.318
It's very close.

31:27.319 --> 31:27.653
Yeah.

31:27.654 --> 31:32.357
Nicely done, chef.

31:32.358 --> 31:33.691
There we are.

31:33.692 --> 31:35.026
Look at the beautiful
girl there.

31:35.027 --> 31:35.661
Cheers.

31:35.662 --> 31:38.329
Here we go.

31:38.330 --> 31:44.669
What was that?

31:44.670 --> 31:45.337
What's in it?

31:45.338 --> 31:46.771
What is that?

31:46.772 --> 31:49.540
I don't know exactly
how you make that.

31:49.541 --> 31:53.211
But it has been drinking
in Denmark for many years.

31:53.212 --> 31:56.714
So we have gameldansk.

31:56.715 --> 31:59.484
It has about 30
different herbs or so.

31:59.485 --> 32:04.855
So we made an ice cream.

32:04.856 --> 32:06.057
It was delicious.

32:06.058 --> 32:09.860
Oh, here we go.

32:09.861 --> 32:10.196
Gameldansk.

32:10.196 --> 32:10.496
It is good.

32:10.496 --> 32:11.363
It works.

32:11.363 --> 32:12.298
It is good.

32:12.298 --> 32:13.199
It works.

32:13.199 --> 32:13.865
Look at this.

32:13.866 --> 32:15.400
Where you come from, New York?

32:15.401 --> 32:15.901
Yeah.

32:15.901 --> 32:16.835
Yeah.

32:16.835 --> 32:17.369
What?

32:17.370 --> 32:22.140
It works.

32:22.141 --> 32:28.046
He says.

32:28.047 --> 32:29.047
They are perfect.

32:29.048 --> 32:31.983
What would traditional
Danish food be for you?

32:31.984 --> 32:33.418
Potatoes.

32:33.419 --> 32:34.719
Two potatoes.

32:34.720 --> 32:37.355
And some kind of meat and sauce.

32:37.356 --> 32:40.558
Do you taste the sauce?

32:40.559 --> 32:40.759
Yeah?

32:40.760 --> 32:43.194
Hello, fellows.

32:43.195 --> 32:44.929
Fermented barley, and we cooked

32:44.930 --> 32:49.600
the potatoes in that and served

32:49.601 --> 32:54.405
with sturgeon roll
from the lakes.

32:54.406 --> 33:02.406
It has homemade whiskey...
I know the flavor well.

33:02.448 --> 33:07.885
Here we go!

33:07.886 --> 33:08.754
What are we doing?

33:08.755 --> 33:10.688
I'm a little bit hungry.

33:10.689 --> 33:18.689
The Danish national
late night dish.

33:19.731 --> 33:21.766
John's hot dog?

33:21.767 --> 33:22.000
Yes.

33:22.001 --> 33:27.805
I'll have the deluxe.

33:27.806 --> 33:28.640
Organic sausage.

33:28.640 --> 33:29.608
Sounds good to me.

33:29.609 --> 33:32.977
He made his own mustard.

33:32.978 --> 33:34.045
Wow.

33:34.046 --> 33:34.280
Whoa.

33:34.281 --> 33:35.880
Here we go.

33:35.881 --> 33:39.884
That's a classic one.

33:39.885 --> 33:44.222
All my happiest moments seem

33:44.223 --> 33:46.557
to revolve around
meat in two forms.

33:46.558 --> 33:47.825
That's superb.

33:47.826 --> 33:51.896
It's really good.

33:51.897 --> 33:54.965
Don't thrill me when I eat that.

33:54.966 --> 33:56.801
Only the moments
when you look good.

33:56.802 --> 33:59.804
These onions are awesome.

33:59.805 --> 34:01.106
I think that's the way.

34:01.107 --> 34:01.940
You have to make something new.

34:01.941 --> 34:05.843
But respect the classics.

34:05.844 --> 34:09.480
The passion to present
something on a plate that is

34:09.481 --> 34:11.516
delicious, also make sense of

34:11.516 --> 34:17.588
your own environment,
something that is yours.

34:17.589 --> 34:24.062
Come to Copenhagen, Noma for
lunch, John's for dinner.

34:38.277 --> 34:42.612
Just across from Noma,
located in a converted

34:42.614 --> 34:44.815
houseboat, an entity separate
from the restaurant.

34:44.815 --> 34:49.987
The place where Rene set
up to further ideas and

34:49.987 --> 34:50.356
experimentation.

34:50.357 --> 34:52.357
He is one of the
guys in charge here.

34:52.358 --> 34:57.628
Nutmeg is a bit of
a hallucinogenic.

34:57.629 --> 34:59.797
Leave it a while and
see what happens.

34:59.798 --> 35:02.200
Hallucinogenic fish
sauce potentially?

35:02.201 --> 35:02.968
In theory.

35:02.969 --> 35:05.170
Some of the things we are doing,

35:05.171 --> 35:06.971
they are pure experimentation

35:06.972 --> 35:08.139
for experimentation sake and

35:08.140 --> 35:08.807
it's pretty damn delicious.

35:08.808 --> 35:10.141
I like that.

35:10.142 --> 35:11.809
It's another food
item on your shelf.

35:11.810 --> 35:13.911
Me as a cook,
that's what I want.

35:13.912 --> 35:19.550
These are two years old
cherries with the cherry pits.

35:19.551 --> 35:21.419
Five years old wild roses.

35:21.420 --> 35:23.854
This is amazing.

35:23.855 --> 35:25.256
They're talking about will it

35:25.257 --> 35:27.358
taste good in two years if you

35:27.359 --> 35:30.495
ferment it or age it or dry it.

35:30.496 --> 35:31.029
We like to ferment it.

35:31.030 --> 35:33.398
We add bacteria to it, so in

35:33.399 --> 35:37.268
three years time, it
becomes delicious.

35:37.269 --> 35:39.937
The diversity, you're looking at

35:39.938 --> 35:41.071
fermentations and different

35:41.072 --> 35:42.573
bacteria, looking at different

35:42.574 --> 35:44.909
molds, yeast, all sorts.

35:44.910 --> 35:51.182
There is stuff rotting in
jars, these experiments of

35:51.183 --> 35:52.517
fermentation and flavor.

35:52.518 --> 35:54.018
Doing some sinister down there.

35:54.019 --> 35:58.689
This is the ferment from wild

35:58.690 --> 36:04.295
spinach which grows around here.

36:04.296 --> 36:06.564
May this is from a weed
that grows everywhere.

36:06.565 --> 36:08.233
You can do it with gooseberries.

36:08.234 --> 36:10.701
Like to ferment gooseberries.

36:10.702 --> 36:12.670
You get golden drops
of perfection.

36:12.671 --> 36:15.473
We have two berries.

36:15.474 --> 36:17.041
The next thing we serve you is

36:17.042 --> 36:19.043
the dried juices from last

36:19.044 --> 36:27.044
year's harvest of black
currant, and then so creamy.

36:28.554 --> 36:36.554
It's like superpower.

36:38.764 --> 36:40.498
You need to ask about this.

36:40.499 --> 36:42.300
Well, this is
pretty interesting.

36:42.301 --> 36:45.903
This is born out of a desire
to study mummify kags.

36:45.904 --> 36:49.807
Everyone used to eat
mummies, apparently.

36:49.808 --> 36:51.242
So this has been cured with

36:51.243 --> 36:54.512
resins, alcohol,
spices, with honey.

36:54.513 --> 37:01.586
All kinds of things that
would have been used in a

37:01.587 --> 37:05.323
mummification process.

37:05.324 --> 37:05.857
So it's quite moldy.

37:05.858 --> 37:08.993
I mean, it's like an experiment.

37:08.994 --> 37:12.096
It's a 6-month-old piece here.

37:12.097 --> 37:13.698
I guess it's
somewhat inevitable.

37:13.699 --> 37:15.600
It's not unpleasant.

37:15.601 --> 37:15.967
Interesting.

37:15.968 --> 37:22.373
Tastes like Egyptian.

37:22.374 --> 37:26.711
We just have one project.

37:26.712 --> 37:28.779
Deliciousness is an argument
for eating insects.

37:28.780 --> 37:33.851
Wow.

37:33.852 --> 37:39.724
Here we have grilled onions

37:39.725 --> 37:41.158
and salt made out of wood ants.

37:41.159 --> 37:41.960
That's delicious.

37:41.961 --> 37:47.164
Some of the ants we've
been experimenting with.

37:47.165 --> 37:50.335
It's like zing,
excitement in your mouth.

37:50.336 --> 37:53.971
The other ones, they
need a lot of work.

37:53.972 --> 38:01.972
Here we've got wax
lava worm mousse.

38:04.816 --> 38:06.884
This tastes like insects.

38:06.885 --> 38:09.720
Next fermented fish, herrings

38:09.721 --> 38:11.356
molded with stuffed Greens.

38:11.357 --> 38:13.324
These have been
here since January.

38:13.325 --> 38:15.693
So it's been filtered and put

38:15.694 --> 38:18.028
with Juniper and a little squirt

38:18.029 --> 38:20.531
of aged apple vinegar.

38:20.532 --> 38:20.766
Wow.

38:20.767 --> 38:23.334
That's delicious.

38:23.335 --> 38:24.669
That's lethally good.

38:24.670 --> 38:26.170
I can think of ten different

38:26.171 --> 38:27.237
ways I'd like to eat that.

38:27.238 --> 38:27.873
Definitely.

38:27.874 --> 38:33.444
Standing up, sitting
down, with beer.

38:33.445 --> 38:35.012
Beings are being fed.

38:35.013 --> 38:37.915
It takes awhile to stumble
across these things.

38:37.916 --> 38:40.285
Surely they come out
of the woodwork.

38:53.365 --> 38:54.365
Let's have some crayfish.

38:54.366 --> 39:02.366
Delicious.

39:03.642 --> 39:04.543
Cheers, guys.

39:04.543 --> 39:04.910
Cheers, guys.

39:04.911 --> 39:09.814
Cheers.

39:09.815 --> 39:10.749
Mid-summer's day.

39:10.750 --> 39:13.551
Longest day of the year.

39:13.552 --> 39:17.655
The day to Mark the
mid-summer's Eve gather and

39:17.656 --> 39:18.723
partake in traditions.

39:18.724 --> 39:23.260
Then sun comes out,
we salute you.

39:23.261 --> 39:25.062
Building picnics and bonfires.

39:25.063 --> 39:26.330
There's going to be a fire.

39:26.331 --> 39:27.565
And burning witches.

39:27.566 --> 39:29.066
We made those fires back in

39:29.067 --> 39:32.102
the days to keep
the witches away.

39:32.103 --> 39:35.339
Because they thought all the

39:35.340 --> 39:41.412
witches was meeting
on this solstice.

39:41.413 --> 39:42.413
Where's the Pork?

39:42.414 --> 39:44.081
This is the roast pork.

39:44.082 --> 39:48.118
Very traditional.

39:48.119 --> 39:48.920
Without this they
could not live.

39:48.921 --> 39:56.921
So we have pork skin
and dried chocolate.

39:57.996 --> 40:00.765
That's wild.

40:00.766 --> 40:03.701
Roasted pork with cabbage.

40:03.702 --> 40:09.940
That is a serious sandwich.

40:09.941 --> 40:11.108
That's just amazing.

40:11.109 --> 40:12.142
Oh, a rainbow.

40:12.143 --> 40:20.143
This is almost too pretty.

40:21.019 --> 40:26.691
And there you go.

40:26.692 --> 40:31.328
Super cool, huh?

40:31.329 --> 40:35.966
Why don't we have
the strawberries?

40:35.967 --> 40:36.535
With triple cream, huh?

40:36.536 --> 40:39.804
It's delicious.

40:39.805 --> 40:43.574
We have wild blueberry desserts.

40:43.575 --> 40:45.142
The sandwich, one
for each of you.

40:45.143 --> 40:48.412
And the first of the
wild strawberries.

40:48.413 --> 40:49.247
Look at this.

40:49.248 --> 40:53.484
Like a picnic in the park, yeah?

40:53.485 --> 40:54.552
Mm.

40:54.553 --> 40:55.720
Wow.

40:55.721 --> 41:00.324
So the mid-summer
day in Denmark.

41:00.325 --> 41:03.494
Wow.

41:03.495 --> 41:04.829
Look at the witch.

41:04.830 --> 41:08.199
Burn, witch, burn.

41:20.712 --> 41:21.012
You done?

41:21.013 --> 41:24.048
Terrific, thank you.

41:24.049 --> 41:25.349
Unbelievable.

41:25.350 --> 41:27.051
Look, I've eaten at a lot of

41:27.052 --> 41:28.118
great restaurants around the

41:28.119 --> 41:29.219
world, and there was still a

41:29.220 --> 41:30.220
little part of me that was

41:30.221 --> 41:35.293
saying this the going to be bull

41:35.694 --> 41:37.962
The guy's out in the field

41:37.963 --> 41:40.297
yanking weeds out of the ground.

41:40.298 --> 41:42.199
I didn't expect it to
be as good as it was.

41:42.200 --> 41:44.134
It was delicious.

41:44.135 --> 41:44.636
Amazingly delicious.

41:44.636 --> 41:45.403
Amazing.

41:45.404 --> 41:48.706
Yes, I thought it was amazing.

41:48.707 --> 41:52.476
It's not just about coming
up with the concept.

41:52.477 --> 41:58.048
It's assembling what is out
there in a new, beautiful,

41:58.049 --> 41:58.884
authentic and delicious way.

41:58.885 --> 42:03.554
He has single handedly
transformed everybody's

42:03.555 --> 42:06.490
understanding of
Nordic cuisines.

42:06.491 --> 42:08.092
They all tell a bit of a story.

42:08.093 --> 42:09.660
Of the land, the tradition.

42:09.661 --> 42:11.495
But always delicious.

42:11.496 --> 42:13.998
Always, always, always
delicious first.

42:13.999 --> 42:15.966
You may be an ordinary guy,

42:15.967 --> 42:17.735
grounded, comes
from a poor family.

42:17.736 --> 42:19.169
But he has big dreams.

42:19.170 --> 42:21.405
He wants to change the world.

42:21.406 --> 42:21.907
And we can change it.

42:21.907 --> 42:22.307
Never forget that.

42:22.308 --> 42:27.979
We can do that.
