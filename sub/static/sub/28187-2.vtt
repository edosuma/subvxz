00:10.345 --> 00:12.514
Time for a story.

00:12.681 --> 00:14.641
'Cause sometimes,

00:14.808 --> 00:18.144
people need reminding
of things.

00:18.311 --> 00:21.648
Help him remind
the people who you are.

00:21.815 --> 00:23.608
The choice is yours.

00:23.775 --> 00:25.151
Evolve...

00:25.318 --> 00:26.736
...or die.

00:28.279 --> 00:30.031
I guess I believe in him.

00:31.408 --> 00:33.118
I wanna believe in you.

00:34.160 --> 00:35.870
Zorya Vechernyaya...

00:36.037 --> 00:38.790
Do you know how beautiful
you look?

00:38.957 --> 00:41.710
Your tongue
is a wicked thing.

00:41.876 --> 00:43.878
Nobody's ever complained
about my tongue.

00:44.963 --> 00:48.216
I can't sell war
without my best salesman.

00:51.302 --> 00:53.304
Find Media...

00:58.101 --> 01:02.439
Let them know what
real sacrifice...

01:03.273 --> 01:04.649
...feels like.

01:08.945 --> 01:11.239
Shadow!

01:12.741 --> 01:15.034
Is this what it takes?

01:16.035 --> 01:19.122
Is this... what it takes?

03:48.688 --> 03:50.773
My name is Mr. Town.

03:56.571 --> 03:58.156
Where am I?

03:59.115 --> 04:02.160
No, the question, Shadow,
isn't "where."

04:03.536 --> 04:04.913
It's "why?"

04:27.518 --> 04:29.479
This is not good.

04:30.813 --> 04:34.609
There's... much to be done.

04:35.610 --> 04:38.863
The bell must ring.
Mirrors covered.

04:39.030 --> 04:41.532
Windows opened.
We must sprinkle the holy salt.

04:41.699 --> 04:44.577
Arre Czernobog.
We will summon the next Zorya.

04:45.536 --> 04:46.704
Votan!

04:47.372 --> 04:49.165
You let the dust
of the old star

04:49.332 --> 04:53.836
slip right through your fingers,
huh?

04:54.003 --> 04:58.216
There are no more believers
left for Zorya.

04:58.800 --> 05:01.719
So there will be
no more life for her.

05:02.345 --> 05:05.056
But I know a new star

05:05.223 --> 05:08.184
will soon rise from the horizon.

05:09.352 --> 05:12.647
And the hound's gate
will rest in the hands

05:12.814 --> 05:14.899
of this newborn star.

05:15.066 --> 05:18.194
We must pray that
she's up to the task.

05:19.070 --> 05:23.908
If not, this country will be
barren of believers.

05:24.909 --> 05:27.495
First a whimper,
then a crescendo.

05:27.662 --> 05:30.123
You will have your vengeance,
my friends.

05:30.289 --> 05:33.751
When my hammer swings,

05:33.918 --> 05:36.671
the earth will tremble...

05:36.838 --> 05:39.215
...the mountains will break,
and the ocean will rise,

05:39.382 --> 05:41.509
and our enemies
will be banished

05:41.676 --> 05:45.471
to the deepest darkness
of the nine hells.

05:46.514 --> 05:47.849
Votan...

05:48.933 --> 05:51.853
this country... is no good.

05:55.898 --> 05:58.026
- You have your war, Grimnir.
- Mama-ji.

05:58.192 --> 06:00.737
You hear the battle cries.
May I count on your blades?

06:00.903 --> 06:03.156
You brought the fight
to my doorstep.

06:03.322 --> 06:06.325
I have no choice but
to resume the lopping of heads,

06:06.492 --> 06:09.746
drinking of blood,
and liberating of souls.

06:10.705 --> 06:13.207
That is, if I can swap
my weekend shift with Arjun.

06:13.374 --> 06:16.794
Hey, what's the plan?

06:21.632 --> 06:23.092
This is so stupid.
We're wasting time.

06:23.259 --> 06:24.635
Oh, let 'em lament.

06:24.802 --> 06:26.554
Shadow was taken.
We don't have time

06:26.721 --> 06:28.639
for a fucking wake
in a parking lot.

06:30.349 --> 06:32.185
Might be no coming back
for that one.

06:32.685 --> 06:34.270
Yeah, no shit. She's dead.

06:35.188 --> 06:38.566
Dead does not seem to be as
final as you are implying.

06:40.568 --> 06:42.653
Ifrit, Grimnir needs you
in Mitchell,

06:42.820 --> 06:46.657
at the Corn Palace;
ask for Old Iktomi.

06:47.241 --> 06:48.826
To what end?

06:48.993 --> 06:50.411
Gungnir.

06:54.874 --> 06:55.917
Gungnir?

06:57.126 --> 06:58.544
His fucking spear.

07:04.592 --> 07:06.511
You're getting Fire-eyes
and the fairy

07:06.677 --> 07:08.137
to fetch
your fucking spear for ya?

07:08.304 --> 07:09.806
What do you plan to do
about Shadow?

07:09.972 --> 07:12.975
He'll be fine. Great battles
require great preparation.

07:13.392 --> 07:15.686
And sacrifice to you.

07:16.813 --> 07:18.272
You don't give a shit
about him.

07:18.439 --> 07:20.108
Oh, I very much give a shit.

07:20.441 --> 07:22.068
Just have faith in your man.

07:22.568 --> 07:25.404
My favorite Tammy Wynette
song. Shotgun!

07:27.907 --> 07:29.867
Oh, now Spiderman's
ridin' with ya?

07:30.451 --> 07:32.245
You keep givin' away
my fucking seats.

07:32.870 --> 07:34.539
What happened
to our arrangement?

07:34.997 --> 07:36.541
Well, you two make
such a great pair,

07:36.707 --> 07:38.501
it seems a shame
to split you up.

07:38.668 --> 07:40.294
And Laura seems to feel
Shadow needs saving,

07:40.461 --> 07:42.380
so go help save Shadow.

07:42.547 --> 07:45.133
I will not be dyin' in battle
over Shadow fucking Moon.

07:45.299 --> 07:47.009
A problem of your own making.

07:47.176 --> 07:50.930
You are the biggest,
most unlucky leprechaun

07:51.097 --> 07:53.391
- I have ever met!
- Bugger off!

07:53.558 --> 07:56.102
Bugger yourself off, bitch!

08:01.315 --> 08:03.276
What a cunt.

08:12.577 --> 08:14.787
Allahu Akbar.

09:02.293 --> 09:04.837
Do you need money?
For the bus?

09:05.213 --> 09:07.340
- I'm coming with you.
- No.

09:08.049 --> 09:10.009
Where Wednesday wants
me to go is dangerous.

09:10.176 --> 09:12.261
Then why risk your
life for him?

09:12.637 --> 09:14.805
Allah would not want you
to sacrifice for Wednesday.

09:14.972 --> 09:17.058
I believe in what I'm doing
even if you do not.

09:45.086 --> 09:46.754
You're not coming with me?

09:46.921 --> 09:49.006
Nope, I'm goin' with my coin.

09:49.173 --> 09:51.050
Grimnir's takin' up arms.

09:51.217 --> 09:52.760
That means
there's a battle at hand.

09:52.927 --> 09:54.553
And you're fucking crazy
if you think

09:54.720 --> 09:56.389
I'm going to war
without my luck.

10:00.268 --> 10:02.144
Well, I guess you should
steal us a car, then.

10:02.311 --> 10:04.814
You do the pickin',
I'll do the pluckin'.

10:09.694 --> 10:11.404
If you get in my way,

10:11.570 --> 10:13.489
the gods are gonna be
planning your funeral.

10:13.656 --> 10:15.992
Best they already are, love.

10:16.867 --> 10:18.160
Best they already are.

10:50.943 --> 10:54.238
We couldn't find any records

10:54.405 --> 10:56.407
of any family

10:56.574 --> 11:01.329
other than your mother
and your late wife.

11:02.955 --> 11:05.166
You know what that makes you,
Shadow? Hm?

11:06.167 --> 11:07.626
Just another bastard.

11:08.502 --> 11:13.257
A nobody. A nobody
who went to prison

11:14.050 --> 11:18.429
for a botched casino heist
and aggravated assault.

11:20.598 --> 11:22.099
Now...

11:24.769 --> 11:26.687
I know they had guns
on your wife.

11:29.398 --> 11:33.694
So, does that make the
career criminal a good guy?

11:36.364 --> 11:39.116
Although, not quite
good enough, apparently,

11:39.283 --> 11:42.078
because you couldn't keep
your wife

11:42.828 --> 11:46.207
from sucking
your best friend's cock.

11:46.374 --> 11:48.459
You want to stay in your lane.

11:49.960 --> 11:52.671
You're one tough
motherfucker, Shadow Moon.

11:52.838 --> 11:54.340
I'll give you that.

11:55.299 --> 11:57.093
Is that why Cargo needs you?
Hmm?

11:59.678 --> 12:01.514
I don't know who the fuck
Cargo is.

12:01.680 --> 12:03.557
Eh.

12:13.234 --> 12:15.945
He calls himself All-Father.

12:17.196 --> 12:20.074
Grimm.

12:20.241 --> 12:23.953
He goes by the name...
Wednesday.

12:26.831 --> 12:31.001
And you, my friend, you've been
traveling with him for weeks.

12:36.257 --> 12:38.509
I'm just a bodyguard, okay?

12:39.927 --> 12:42.012
- He doesn't tell me anything.
- Let me ask you a question.

12:42.179 --> 12:44.098
When somebody...when somebody
tells you to rob a casino,

12:44.265 --> 12:46.225
or a bank, then you do it.

12:46.392 --> 12:48.310
When someone tells you
to join the Old Gods

12:48.477 --> 12:51.605
in a secret war against
the New Gods, then you do it.

12:52.648 --> 12:54.942
You are always just going
with the flow, Shadow.

12:55.109 --> 12:59.280
And I need to know, why?
Why the fuck is that?

12:59.447 --> 13:01.449
Hmm?

13:04.118 --> 13:05.411
Curious spirit.

13:13.711 --> 13:15.421
It could be, Shadow,

13:15.588 --> 13:20.092
that you have forgotten
how to tell the truth.

13:42.865 --> 13:45.326
Now that's a mighty woman
with a torch.

13:47.578 --> 13:51.040
She was a Roman
goddess. Libertas.

13:51.207 --> 13:53.375
"Give me your tired,
your poor,

13:53.542 --> 13:56.629
your huddled masses
yearning to be free."

13:57.463 --> 13:59.131
France gave her
to the founders,

13:59.298 --> 14:01.008
same as they gave democracy.

14:01.634 --> 14:04.303
And pulled America's butt out
of the fire in the Revolution.

14:04.470 --> 14:06.096
We've paid 'em back.

14:07.473 --> 14:10.518
You're not French, Shadow.
Don't forget that.

14:12.895 --> 14:14.813
Yeah, a home,
I don't know.

14:14.980 --> 14:17.566
I had to leave to
spread her message.

14:18.400 --> 14:20.611
Why is this
my first time back?

14:21.195 --> 14:23.155
Her dream isn't for us.

14:23.322 --> 14:26.534
Liberty can't help but judge us
by the color of our skin.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.911
The history
we remind them of.

14:29.078 --> 14:31.121
Doesn't have to be like that.

14:31.413 --> 14:34.166
Scientists call it hormesis.

14:35.167 --> 14:37.795
A little bit of poison
to make you stronger.

14:38.629 --> 14:41.215
Your light is strong,
my beautiful son.

14:43.884 --> 14:45.970
I don't think
I'm gonna like it here.

14:48.347 --> 14:49.974
One summer.

14:50.683 --> 14:52.601
Then we're back
on the world tour.

15:13.831 --> 15:15.749
You know, you could show
a little gratitude

15:15.916 --> 15:17.376
every now and then.

15:17.543 --> 15:20.129
- Might improve your luck.
- I don't believe in luck.

15:21.463 --> 15:25.467
- I don't. I'm an atheist.
- Ugh.

15:26.218 --> 15:29.263
God is a fairy tale
for grown-ups.

15:29.763 --> 15:31.932
Well, you're in the fairy tale
now, aren't ya?

15:33.350 --> 15:35.644
He is definitely moving.

15:36.228 --> 15:37.521
Turn here.

15:40.774 --> 15:43.110
You things are not gods,
by the way.

15:43.277 --> 15:45.070
You're made by people.

15:45.237 --> 15:46.697
People who need answers

15:46.864 --> 15:48.782
and they're too fucking lazy
to look for them themselves.

15:48.949 --> 15:51.285
I mean, who the fuck
ever needed a leprechaun?

15:51.452 --> 15:53.746
You take and you take
and you take

15:53.912 --> 15:56.206
and what do you give back
to people? Nothing.

15:56.582 --> 15:59.251
You are monsters under the bed,
just fucking with human lives.

15:59.418 --> 16:02.463
Pot, kettle, black! And God
didn't fuck up your life.

16:02.630 --> 16:04.465
You did a great job
of that all by yourself.

16:04.632 --> 16:06.300
It was my life
to fuck up!

16:06.467 --> 16:09.428
Indeed it was, and you fucked
the shit out of it, didn't ya?

16:09.595 --> 16:11.221
Fucked up your husband's life
as well.

16:11.388 --> 16:13.223
Got him sent to prison.

16:13.390 --> 16:15.976
And then, when he was payin'
his penance for you,

16:16.143 --> 16:18.145
ya sucked all over
his best friend's knob.

16:18.312 --> 16:20.230
I don't know what
kind of syphilitic time period

16:20.397 --> 16:22.858
spawned leprechauns,
but in my world,

16:23.025 --> 16:25.486
infidelity does not warrant
a death sentence.

16:26.904 --> 16:28.989
Where I'm from,
it's the greatest sin.

16:30.866 --> 16:32.785
To betray your sworn
true love is the crime

16:32.951 --> 16:34.411
- of a coward--
- Cow.

16:45.714 --> 16:47.091
You're welcome.

16:58.310 --> 16:59.520
Fuck!

17:26.672 --> 17:30.342
It's unfortunate that
none of your compatriots

17:30.509 --> 17:33.262
were moved by your pitch,
Queen Bilquis.

17:33.429 --> 17:35.848
It was beautiful. Elegant.

17:36.348 --> 17:38.559
Everything that you are.

17:39.351 --> 17:41.854
Your attack will only work
against you.

17:42.020 --> 17:43.897
Make it easier for Odin

17:44.064 --> 17:47.526
to convince those who were
on the fence to join his cause.

17:49.319 --> 17:51.405
The Old Gods will scatter,

17:51.572 --> 17:54.158
hiding their heads
in the depths.

17:54.825 --> 17:59.329
Only to sprout anew
and find me waiting.

18:00.664 --> 18:02.916
The way to kill
Wednesday's hydra

18:04.209 --> 18:06.336
is to lasso their necks

18:06.503 --> 18:09.548
and chop them all at once.

18:09.965 --> 18:12.676
Miss and they will
come back stronger.

18:17.389 --> 18:19.892
The ghost of Zorya
Vechernyaya knows

18:20.058 --> 18:22.728
that Mr. World doesn't miss.

18:25.314 --> 18:27.566
I have no place
on your battlefield.

18:28.650 --> 18:32.946
Love is the most
powerful weapon of war.

18:33.113 --> 18:37.826
War tears lovers asunder.

18:43.540 --> 18:46.877
Love and war may sit
on opposite sides of a coin,

18:48.587 --> 18:50.881
but only so they may
never meet.

18:53.759 --> 18:55.719
I will not fight for you.

18:59.973 --> 19:02.226
The Old Gods see you
as a traitor.

19:03.060 --> 19:05.604
Complicit in the death
of their kin.

19:06.480 --> 19:08.899
And you shun the gods
of progress,

19:09.066 --> 19:11.443
so I wonder,

19:12.611 --> 19:15.072
if you don't choose a side,

19:16.573 --> 19:18.909
will you be trampled by both?

19:34.925 --> 19:36.260
Damn it.

19:37.845 --> 19:40.764
You gonna fold that
or fuck it?

19:43.767 --> 19:45.435
I'm gonna fuck it.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.125
Aaah!

20:09.751 --> 20:11.753
You know,
Mr. World wants to know why

20:11.920 --> 20:15.549
Mr. Wednesday has put so much
trust in a petty con man.

20:15.716 --> 20:20.512
Why Mr. Wednesday would bring
a nobody like you

20:20.679 --> 20:22.806
into his tribe.

20:22.973 --> 20:27.227
He doesn't tell me anything.

20:40.866 --> 20:44.870
The awakening man was
on the way to himself.

20:46.121 --> 20:48.332
Is there a book
that you haven't read?

20:48.498 --> 20:51.752
A good book is a loyal
and constant friend.

20:53.795 --> 20:55.547
Jerry and I might...

20:56.048 --> 20:57.716
grab a drink later.

20:59.885 --> 21:01.762
You know,
he has bad taste in music.

21:04.389 --> 21:05.974
How do I look?

21:07.684 --> 21:09.061
Age appropriate.

21:12.814 --> 21:14.816
If you go outside,
Bushwick has territories.

21:14.983 --> 21:17.235
Not every place is
the same place.

21:19.154 --> 21:21.114

my beautiful son.

Where you from?

22:48.118 --> 22:49.786
France.

France?

22:51.455 --> 22:52.664

24:13.245 --> 24:15.163
Those boys and those cops,

24:15.330 --> 24:17.415
they want
the same things we do:

24:18.458 --> 24:20.752
to be valued,
to matter in this world.

24:20.919 --> 24:23.004
And to feel some love.

24:23.922 --> 24:25.590
But they don't even know me.

24:25.757 --> 24:27.300
They think they do.

24:27.467 --> 24:29.052

24:35.016 --> 24:36.935
One who will take
what they have.

24:37.102 --> 24:39.146
Keep them from getting
what they want.

24:39.312 --> 24:41.273
But that's not me.

24:41.439 --> 24:43.233
It doesn't matter.

24:43.400 --> 24:46.987
Most things people believe
about the world are lies.

24:48.113 --> 24:50.866
But you know the truth
of who you are, Shadow.

24:53.118 --> 24:56.037
Yeah. Not all of it.

25:00.458 --> 25:01.751
He's dead.

25:02.794 --> 25:04.254
Who was he?

that aren't flocking to ya?

26:19.454 --> 26:21.331
Just change the fucking tire.

Fuck!

26:44.312 --> 26:46.231
You better stop lollygagging.

26:46.398 --> 26:48.191
Otherwise, Shadow's better off
savin' himself.

26:48.358 --> 26:49.901
I'm lifting an entire car.

26:50.068 --> 26:51.653
Yeah? Last week,
you could've lifted

26:51.820 --> 26:53.446
an entire fuckin' elephant!

26:53.613 --> 26:55.991
Two fuckin' elephants
if my nuts are the judge.

26:57.117 --> 26:59.035
Hang on.

27:02.163 --> 27:03.999
All right. Let 'er down.

27:16.636 --> 27:18.555
- Can you not?
- What?

27:18.722 --> 27:20.932
Hover over me like a vulture.

27:21.099 --> 27:24.102
Pffft!

27:24.269 --> 27:25.729
I wasn't.

27:26.813 --> 27:29.983
Just relax, okay? You'll get
your fucking coin back.

27:30.150 --> 27:32.235
Either I fall apart
and you take it from me,

27:32.402 --> 27:34.029
or I get my life back

27:34.195 --> 27:36.990
and I will gladly
cram it down your throat.

27:39.451 --> 27:41.369
If you truly
want your life back,

27:41.536 --> 27:43.330
I might have
another option for ya.

27:46.458 --> 27:49.836
There's a devil in the French
Quarter of New Orleans.

27:50.003 --> 27:52.047
Haven't seen him
in a donkey's age.

27:52.213 --> 27:54.466
Yeah, there was also
a woman in Kentucky.

27:54.632 --> 27:57.302
None better with the spice
of life than the old Baron.

27:57.469 --> 27:59.429
And that's a good thing
for me?

27:59.596 --> 28:01.598
Price will be steep.

28:01.765 --> 28:04.017
How badly you want it?

28:04.184 --> 28:06.811
I will literally do anything.

28:09.189 --> 28:11.232
After we get Shadow.

28:19.699 --> 28:23.161
This motherfucker asked me
if I want something to eat.

28:25.038 --> 28:27.123
And then he gets in the car

28:27.290 --> 28:31.169
with a bucket
of fried fucking chicken.

28:47.936 --> 28:49.521
Where'd the chicken go?

28:49.687 --> 28:52.816
Oh, it was so good.
Thank you for that. Thank you.

28:53.316 --> 28:55.276
- You ate it all?
- Mm-hmm.

28:55.443 --> 28:58.238
- You good?
- Yeah, I just... So good.

29:03.868 --> 29:07.747
Media! Oh, Media!

29:07.914 --> 29:10.417
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

29:11.209 --> 29:14.421
All this normy noise
is making me itch.

29:14.587 --> 29:17.549
Hey! I see you.

29:18.383 --> 29:20.301
Come on.
Mr. World wants you.

29:21.761 --> 29:23.680
"We can't drive into the future

29:23.847 --> 29:26.391
using only our rearview mirror."

29:26.558 --> 29:29.352
No shit. Come on.
Get in the car.

29:33.022 --> 29:36.067
20th century is
ancient history,

29:36.234 --> 29:38.236
like the faces you wear.

29:38.570 --> 29:41.156
Bowie and Marilyn
and I Love Lucy.

29:41.322 --> 29:45.702
They are so fucking retro.
And art? Art is irrelevant!

29:45.869 --> 29:48.913
<i>Art is the most
valuable means of insight</i>

29:49.080 --> 29:51.458
<i>into the direction
of our collective purpose.</i>

29:52.208 --> 29:55.545
You're looking for insight.

29:55.712 --> 29:57.630
<i>The appetite for distraction
is infinite.</i>

29:57.797 --> 30:00.091
You're looking for insight.

30:00.258 --> 30:02.177
<i>I can choke them with trivia.</i>

30:02.343 --> 30:04.262
<i>Drown them
in passive pleasures,</i>

30:04.429 --> 30:07.474
<i>and devastate their
spirituality with baby talk.</i>

30:08.933 --> 30:10.852
Wednesday scared
the shit outta you

30:11.019 --> 30:13.104
so now you're back in school.

30:13.271 --> 30:15.982
<i>No distinction between
education and entertainment.</i>

30:16.149 --> 30:18.193
<i>I'm adapting,
learning to survive.</i>

30:18.359 --> 30:20.445
If I go back empty-handed,

30:20.612 --> 30:22.906
he'll downvote my ass
to obsolete!

30:23.072 --> 30:25.492
<i>I will not launch
before I'm prepared.</i>

30:26.075 --> 30:27.911
World needs you back,
right now!

30:28.077 --> 30:29.579
Get your incomprehensively
aggravated--

30:29.746 --> 30:31.414
<i>Good-bye.</i>

30:37.253 --> 30:38.796
Fatal flaw.

30:39.923 --> 30:42.258
Underestimating me.

30:43.426 --> 30:46.596
You think you can ghost
in my machine?

30:48.097 --> 30:50.475
I am mankind's
greatest achievement.

30:50.642 --> 30:52.977
I am the compass rose.

30:53.144 --> 30:57.815
I am fucking binary.

30:57.982 --> 31:01.236
Without me, shit don't spin.

31:01.736 --> 31:05.198
You can't hide,
so lick your wounds,

31:05.365 --> 31:08.409
strap on whichever do
makes you feel the mostest,

31:08.576 --> 31:12.413
put your face on, and come out!
Come out!

31:12.580 --> 31:14.582
Mr. World needs you.

31:18.169 --> 31:21.798
Do not make me hunt you.

31:23.967 --> 31:25.677
Out of respect,

31:27.428 --> 31:29.264
I'm gonna give you a minute.

31:31.849 --> 31:33.142
Good talk.

31:43.194 --> 31:44.237
Fuck!

31:55.498 --> 31:59.419
<i>Dr. Kacinszky,
please report to Oncology.</i>

31:59.586 --> 32:01.671
<i>Dr. Kacinszky to Oncology.</i>

32:10.513 --> 32:12.223
It shouldn't be
too much longer.

32:12.390 --> 32:15.476
I know. It's been a long day.

32:15.643 --> 32:17.520
The test should be back soon.

32:17.687 --> 32:19.355
Thank you.

32:41.419 --> 32:43.630
You make it look like magic.

32:43.796 --> 32:46.424
That's the funny thing
about magic.

32:47.967 --> 32:50.553
It takes years of practice.

32:51.679 --> 32:52.972
For most people.

33:52.824 --> 33:55.743
No. I don't want him
to live in the States.

33:57.161 --> 33:58.788
There's nothing here for him.

34:02.834 --> 34:04.919
But I've raised him
around the world.

34:07.463 --> 34:09.006
I am fighting!

34:09.173 --> 34:11.843
I've been fighting
every day of my goddamn life!

34:13.720 --> 34:16.264
I don't know
how much longer I have.

34:16.431 --> 34:20.351
Hey, hey! Where
do you think you're going?!

34:21.394 --> 34:23.312
Yo, speak English,
motherfucker.

36:11.712 --> 36:13.464
This isn't who you are.

36:14.590 --> 36:16.175
The kid was getting beat up.

36:16.342 --> 36:18.261
He needed help. I was
just trying to protect him.

36:18.427 --> 36:20.137
You were looking for trouble.

36:23.891 --> 36:26.686
It doesn't matter
where you are.

36:28.479 --> 36:30.231
You're here now.

36:30.398 --> 36:33.568
If you put anger out there,
it will come back tenfold.

36:34.569 --> 36:36.487
You're different.

36:36.654 --> 36:39.407
There's a light in you that is
stronger than anything else.

36:39.574 --> 36:41.075
I don't feel it.

36:41.242 --> 36:43.035
It's there.

36:45.329 --> 36:47.123
How do you know?

36:50.501 --> 36:52.128
I gave it to you.

36:54.839 --> 36:57.049
I give it to you every day.

37:15.026 --> 37:17.278
Can you speed it up?
I can barely see him.

37:17.445 --> 37:19.447
What do you usually drive?
Horse and buggy?

37:19.614 --> 37:21.532
Says the corpse who flipped
an ice cream truck.

37:21.699 --> 37:23.868
Oh, my God.

37:28.664 --> 37:31.292
Oh, yay.
This'll be fun.

37:31.459 --> 37:33.669
He's going so fast.

37:33.836 --> 37:36.005
Way too fast to be in a car.

37:36.172 --> 37:37.548
I'll survive the turnover.

37:37.715 --> 37:39.425
There'll be pieces of you
all over the road.

37:45.264 --> 37:46.599
Aah!

37:52.063 --> 37:53.648
What the fuck?!

38:06.869 --> 38:08.913
How does a road just end?

38:44.490 --> 38:46.993
Graveyards are full
of flowers.

38:48.285 --> 38:49.578
Yup.

38:50.955 --> 38:53.082
Just another dead girl
in a field.

39:19.233 --> 39:21.360
So, you're just gonna
lie there, then?

39:22.945 --> 39:25.322
I think the worms are calling.

39:26.657 --> 39:28.617
This is bollocks.

39:28.784 --> 39:30.494
What?

39:30.661 --> 39:32.663
I thought we were going
to save somebody.

39:33.789 --> 39:35.708
We can't just give up
because the fucking road ends.

39:35.875 --> 39:37.793
How the fuck
am I supposed to catch him?

39:37.960 --> 39:40.796
I can't save him
if I can't catch him.

39:43.132 --> 39:45.342
What if I told you
I had a shortcut?

39:47.428 --> 39:50.097
I'd say you were a piece
of shit for holding out on me.

39:51.057 --> 39:52.892
Is that how you ask
for a favor?

39:53.059 --> 39:54.727
What's your shortcut, please?

39:57.938 --> 39:59.815
It's a little bit
like the backstage.

39:59.982 --> 40:01.901
But a lot smaller.

40:02.068 --> 40:03.944
It's a place I can hide things.

40:04.111 --> 40:05.738
Be a tight squeeze
getting through there

40:05.905 --> 40:07.823
with your manky hide
but I can try.

40:07.990 --> 40:09.992
If it's that important to you.

40:11.077 --> 40:14.747
Okay. Yes.
It is. For Shadow.

40:17.666 --> 40:19.502
Alright, then.

40:19.668 --> 40:21.670
- Close your eyes.
- Why?

40:21.837 --> 40:23.380
Think about your man.

40:24.465 --> 40:28.010
How does this work, exactly?

40:28.177 --> 40:30.304
We're goin' through the horde.

40:41.357 --> 40:44.360
- Quit your squealin'!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God.

40:44.527 --> 40:47.571
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, that
shit... that shit is messed up.

40:47.738 --> 40:49.657
Oh, your horde is so messed up.

40:49.824 --> 40:51.742
What the fuck?

40:51.909 --> 40:53.244
Fuck.

40:55.788 --> 40:57.373
Oh, he's on a train.

41:17.184 --> 41:19.145
Fuck off.

41:19.311 --> 41:21.689
You know, you could try a little
gratitude every now and then.

41:23.107 --> 41:24.942
Might improve your luck.

41:42.835 --> 41:45.004
I work for the Gods.

41:45.171 --> 41:47.131
They gave us penicillin
and streaming porn

41:47.298 --> 41:50.259
and aircraft carriers
that circle the globe.

41:52.011 --> 41:54.138
You're siding with the relics
who, quite frankly,

41:54.305 --> 41:57.224
don't deserve
an ounce of your faith.

41:57.808 --> 41:59.977
You've been drifting
since your wife passed away.

42:00.144 --> 42:02.521
Trust me when I tell you there
are dangerous men out there

42:02.688 --> 42:05.816
who prey on marks
just looking to be saved.

42:06.817 --> 42:08.527
I don't need saving.

42:08.694 --> 42:10.362
You sure about that?

42:13.199 --> 42:15.451
Okay.
One more question for you.

42:17.494 --> 42:20.122
There's a man in Chicago.

42:21.832 --> 42:23.751
He had a big cup of hot
chocolate in the morning,

42:23.918 --> 42:25.461
with marshmallows.

42:25.628 --> 42:28.297
And then he went to bed.

42:29.924 --> 42:32.218
And he dreamt of snow.

42:33.928 --> 42:35.638
And when he woke up...

42:37.056 --> 42:38.432
...it'd snowed.

42:41.560 --> 42:44.313
How'd that happen? Hm?

42:46.899 --> 42:48.400
It didn't.

42:48.567 --> 42:50.527
It did.

43:05.626 --> 43:07.586
Grown up fast this summer.

43:09.296 --> 43:11.090
It's not what I wanted.

43:18.973 --> 43:22.518
I don't want you to go, Mom.

43:22.685 --> 43:24.603
Hey.

43:24.770 --> 43:26.689
You think I do?

43:26.855 --> 43:31.360
I don't know how to live here...
not without you.

43:34.905 --> 43:36.490
Be polite.

43:37.658 --> 43:39.201
Respectful.

43:40.327 --> 43:42.162
When you feel the hate
and the pain,

43:42.329 --> 43:44.248
let it make you stronger.

43:46.417 --> 43:48.961
No matter how dark
the world gets,

43:49.128 --> 43:52.131
your light will always
be shining.

44:03.142 --> 44:05.769
Oh, God. Oh, God...

44:05.936 --> 44:07.396

Betty.

46:39.798 --> 46:41.675
Betty the Barbarian.

46:43.135 --> 46:45.387
You were forged
from blue-collar sweat

46:45.554 --> 46:48.682
in the heartland
of a forcibly Christian land.

46:48.849 --> 46:51.852
You are not what you came
into this world as

46:52.019 --> 46:54.521
but instead... a berserker...

46:56.440 --> 46:59.943
and worthy
of a berserker's honor.

47:00.110 --> 47:01.987
Oh, hell, no.

47:02.154 --> 47:04.114
You are the standard
of my world.

47:04.281 --> 47:06.366
Though it might not be
your way,

47:06.533 --> 47:10.746
I honor you in
the most holy way that I know.

47:10.913 --> 47:12.831
The looming locomotive

47:12.998 --> 47:16.043
is the flaming arrow that soars
through the heavy air

47:16.210 --> 47:18.420
from the bow of a Viking king.

47:18.587 --> 47:20.756
Let it strike you true

47:20.923 --> 47:24.301
and light your path
to Valhalla.

47:24.468 --> 47:26.136
Valhalla?

47:26.303 --> 47:29.139
Ain't nobody going
to fucking Valhalla!

47:29.306 --> 47:31.975
I'll see you in Cairo.

47:32.726 --> 47:35.354
You will dine at the table
of the Hooded One.

47:36.522 --> 47:39.149
We will meet
in your reincarnation.

47:40.150 --> 47:41.652
Be proud, Betty.

47:45.697 --> 47:46.990
Be proud.

48:18.564 --> 48:20.482
Hey!

48:21.358 --> 48:22.734
I'm gonna fuck you up!

48:29.449 --> 48:30.867
Missed.

48:31.910 --> 48:33.161
Missed again.

48:34.454 --> 48:36.456
Strike three.

48:55.934 --> 48:58.770
Smile. It's just a bit of fun.

49:31.094 --> 49:32.721
You see this? Hmm?

49:32.888 --> 49:35.557
This coin is a token
of a relic

49:35.724 --> 49:38.268
who is unworthy of your belief.

49:39.728 --> 49:42.064
Come on over
to the winning side, Shadow.

49:42.230 --> 49:46.902
Or stand there
and continue to play the loser.

50:46.378 --> 50:48.046
