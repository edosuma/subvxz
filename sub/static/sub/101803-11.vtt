DAVIS:
Mm... [chuckles]

08:47.657 --> 08:49.877
Right. I-I got to take Hannah

08:49.920 --> 08:53.837
to go see
the OB-GYN Kenobi doctor.

08:53.881 --> 08:55.360
Ah. No, I-I actually
have to go, too.

08:55.404 --> 08:57.014
We just got clearance
to complete

08:57.058 --> 09:00.365

on Raqqa Jacques, so...

09:00.409 --> 09:02.193
Have fun with Hannah.

09:02.237 --> 09:04.587
I will. All right.
I'll call you later.

Bye.Bye.

WILLIAMS:The panel consists
of eight members.

09:08.417 --> 09:10.114
Three are enlisted
and two are battle-tested.

09:10.158 --> 09:11.812
They need three-fourths
to convict.

09:11.855 --> 09:13.857
The prosecution will want
to prove you're a loose cannon

09:13.901 --> 09:15.598
capable of war crimes.

09:15.642 --> 09:18.993
They'll have scoured through
every Bravo AAR and evaluation

09:19.036 --> 09:20.429
from the past two decades.

09:20.472 --> 09:21.691
What exactly
are they looking for?

09:21.735 --> 09:23.519
Violations of protocol,

09:23.563 --> 09:25.652
clashes between you
and other operators.

09:25.695 --> 09:29.307
Anything to show your emotions
overruled tactical judgement.

09:29.351 --> 09:31.571
If their plan is to make my dad
out to be a monster,

09:31.614 --> 09:32.746
what's our plan?

09:32.789 --> 09:34.617
Cite your father's track record.

09:34.661 --> 09:36.401

investigation.

09:37.664 --> 09:39.056

09:43.495 --> 09:45.759
Um, I'm sorry to interrupt,
Lieutenant Commander.

09:45.802 --> 09:47.804
I've got the Raqqa Jacques
dossier.

09:47.848 --> 09:50.067
I also wanted to share
something else with you.

09:50.111 --> 09:52.504
I was reviewing intel
from the Jordan op.

09:52.548 --> 09:56.160
That man with the tattoo holding
the AK, that's Yazeed Nafal.

09:56.204 --> 09:57.945
Whoa.

09:57.988 --> 09:59.033
Let me see that.

09:59.076 --> 10:00.861
EMMA:
That's the guy Dad shot.

10:02.210 --> 10:03.690
They said he was just a driver.

10:03.733 --> 10:05.430
In his recruitment
video, he calls for

10:05.474 --> 10:06.736
"death to the Western world."

10:06.780 --> 10:08.390
"Just a driver" my ass.

10:08.433 --> 10:10.174
I hope that helps.
WILLIAMS:
Excellent work.

10:11.523 --> 10:13.743
Davis, thanks.

10:13.787 --> 10:16.398
Good luck tomorrow.
We're all behind you.

10:19.183 --> 10:20.881
This is a game changer, right?

10:20.924 --> 10:23.274
Proving Nafal was an active
member of the AKM

10:23.318 --> 10:25.102
could demolish
the prosecution's case.

10:25.146 --> 10:26.364
Things are starting
to look up here.

10:26.408 --> 10:27.714
In the courtroom
tomorrow, remember,

10:27.757 --> 10:29.977
it's not just the facts
or your record on trial.

10:30.020 --> 10:32.240
The jury will be
watching you, too.

10:35.069 --> 10:37.158
So when JAG Flores
attacks your character,

10:37.201 --> 10:40.683
or a ruling goes against us,
you don't react.

10:40.727 --> 10:42.946
Stay calm in the chaos
and show the jury

10:42.990 --> 10:45.383
why they can trust you.

10:53.130 --> 10:55.263
All rise.

11:01.225 --> 11:03.575

11:07.144 --> 11:08.668
The court will now
come to order.

11:08.711 --> 11:10.495
Is the government prepared
to make an opening statement?

11:10.539 --> 11:12.759
Yes, Your Honor.
Permission to enter the well.

11:12.802 --> 11:14.717
Proceed.

11:14.761 --> 11:18.286
On 11 March, 2021,
while on a mission

11:18.329 --> 11:20.505
with SEAL Team Bravo
in Irbid, Jordan,

11:20.549 --> 11:23.552
Master Chief Jason Hayes
entered a residential building

11:23.595 --> 11:25.728
and shot and killed
Yazeed Nafal,

11:25.772 --> 11:27.861
an unarmed Jordanian civilian.

11:27.904 --> 11:30.385
The government will demonstrate
by means of video evidence,

11:30.428 --> 11:34.171
timeline and testimony that
Chief Hayes committed murder,

11:34.215 --> 11:36.826
motivated by revenge
on behalf of his best friend

11:36.870 --> 11:40.438
and fellow SEAL, Warrant Officer
Raymond Perry.

11:40.482 --> 11:42.136
This is a tragic event.

11:42.179 --> 11:43.790
While the government has
the utmost respect

11:43.833 --> 11:46.183
for Master Chief Hayes'
service to this country,

11:46.227 --> 11:48.751
he must be held accountable
for this heinous crime.

11:51.972 --> 11:54.583
The prosecution will tell you
that Master Chief Hayes

11:54.626 --> 11:56.280
went rogue.

11:56.324 --> 11:57.847
That he was overcome
with vengeance

11:57.891 --> 12:00.676
and shot an innocent man
in cold blood.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.460
Nonsense.

12:02.504 --> 12:05.681
It is Master Chief Hayes'
unwavering sworn statement

12:05.725 --> 12:09.163
that the deceased, Yazeed
Nafal, an AKM henchman,

12:09.206 --> 12:12.557
was holding an M1951 Beretta
in his left hand.

12:12.601 --> 12:14.821
The taking of a life
might be heinous

12:14.864 --> 12:17.301
to those of us fortunate enough

12:17.345 --> 12:19.260
to never have engaged
in combat,

12:19.303 --> 12:21.828
but the reality is that
Master Chief Hayes

12:21.871 --> 12:25.483
is wrongly on trial
for doing his job.

12:28.225 --> 12:29.923
Mr. Khalaf,
as the representative

12:29.966 --> 12:31.707
of Jordan's General
Intelligence Directorate,

12:31.751 --> 12:33.796
you have intimate knowledge
of the investigation.

12:33.840 --> 12:37.060
Could you tell us what was
discovered at the crime scene?

12:37.104 --> 12:40.368
Police found the body
of Yazeed Nafal in the hallway

12:40.411 --> 12:42.239
with two gunshot wounds
to the chest.

12:42.283 --> 12:45.852
Mr. Khalaf, was a weapon found
on or near Nafal's body?No.

12:45.895 --> 12:47.984
No weapons of any kind.

12:48.028 --> 12:50.334
What other evidence did the
police recover from the scene?

12:50.378 --> 12:52.293
A neighbor came forward to share

12:52.336 --> 12:54.948
a mobile phone video
he recorded.

12:54.991 --> 12:57.515
I will now play the footage
from this cell phone camera.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.525

13:19.233 --> 13:20.538
WILLIAMS:
Mr. Khalaf,

13:20.582 --> 13:23.150
the time stamp on the video
is 12:02 p.m.

13:23.193 --> 13:25.761
Police arrived
at 12:29 p.m.

13:25.805 --> 13:28.459
So it's conceivable
that in 27 minutes,

13:28.503 --> 13:30.461
a passerby could
have taken the gun.

13:30.505 --> 13:31.898
Perhaps even the police or...

the events in a different...

Hayes is on record

at his side

13:40.820 --> 13:42.734
in his left hand.

13:42.778 --> 13:45.259
Could the family of Yazeed Nafal
confirm he was left-handed?

13:45.302 --> 13:47.261
The victim's family,
in their grief,

13:47.304 --> 13:48.958
did not respond to your inquiry.

13:49.002 --> 13:50.307
The "victim."

Right.

13:51.613 --> 13:53.745
Is the Jordanian
government aware

13:53.789 --> 13:56.618
Nafal was not working
for an officer of the AKM

13:56.661 --> 13:58.881
but was an enthusiastic member
of the AKM himself?

13:58.925 --> 14:00.361
I will now play

14:00.404 --> 14:02.189
Exhibit A.Objection.
Lack of foundation.

14:02.232 --> 14:04.278
The defense is putting
the victim on trial.

14:04.321 --> 14:05.409

14:09.239 --> 14:10.588
your late submission

14:10.632 --> 14:12.416

to be inadmissible.

14:12.460 --> 14:14.070
The victim cannot
defend himself

14:14.114 --> 14:15.506
in this courtroom.

14:15.550 --> 14:18.509
The only person on trial
here is Master Chief Hayes.

14:18.553 --> 14:19.554
[slams table]

14:35.091 --> 14:37.267
The judge made a
perplexing ruling,

14:37.311 --> 14:39.922
but you can't
lash out like that.Perplexing?

That's the word you use?
"Perplexing"?

14:42.272 --> 14:44.318
This judge, is he trying
to railroad me, too?

My entire life

14:45.754 --> 14:47.712
is under the microscope here,

14:47.756 --> 14:50.672
and we can't discuss the fact
that this guy was a terrorist?

14:50.715 --> 14:52.717
It's one judge's bad decision.

14:52.761 --> 14:54.763
I'm confident it would be
overturned on appeal.

14:54.806 --> 14:57.287
Appeal?
My entire career will be over

14:57.331 --> 14:59.507
if this goes to appeal.

15:00.725 --> 15:02.249

15:02.292 --> 15:04.294
We've got enough to worry about
with Lindell.

15:04.338 --> 15:06.383
He'll want to distance himself
from any scandal.

then asked to return
to field duty.

15:16.350 --> 15:18.004
Do you know why?

15:18.047 --> 15:20.615
He believed he would have the
most impact on the battlefield.

15:20.658 --> 15:23.009
Couldn't stay out
of the fight, could he?

15:23.052 --> 15:24.880

any reservations

15:24.924 --> 15:27.361
about reinstating
Master Chief Hayes as Bravo 1?

any of my concerns.

Have you ever needed to

Yes, on occasion.

I have here an evaluation
dated 7 October 2019

15:39.025 --> 15:41.941
where you refer to Master Chief
Hayes as a "renegade."

15:41.984 --> 15:43.464
So, in your opinion,

15:43.507 --> 15:44.856
does the Master Chief

15:44.900 --> 15:46.423
play by his own rules?

15:53.691 --> 15:57.695
I was referring to his tactics,

Yes, Your Honor.

Chief Warrant Officer

When did you learn the man you
were hunting was your torturer?

RAY: The night
before the mission.

When did Master Chief
Hayes learn this?

18:40.858 --> 18:42.425
The next morning.

18:42.469 --> 18:44.427
Did Master Chief Hayes
pressure you

18:44.471 --> 18:47.430
into launching an opwithout approval from Jordan?No.

18:47.474 --> 18:50.172
No?

In your deposition, when
asked if Master Chief Hayes

18:52.957 --> 18:55.177
was eager to pursue the
op, you answered yes.

18:55.221 --> 18:58.746
Yes, he wanted to move;
no, he didn't pressure me.

18:59.834 --> 19:01.575
The timeline of events
indicates that

19:01.618 --> 19:03.751
as soon as Master Chief Hayes
knew of your connection

19:03.794 --> 19:06.057
to the mission, the op
was full speed ahead.

19:06.101 --> 19:09.060
Yes, we received time-sensitive
actionable intel that morning.

19:09.104 --> 19:11.585
You're saying the Master Chief's
knowledge of Raqqa Jacques

19:11.628 --> 19:14.327
and the launch of this op
was just a coincidence?

19:14.370 --> 19:15.328
Yes, sir.

19:15.371 --> 19:17.808
Time was of the essence.

19:17.852 --> 19:20.376
How many S.A. missions

You were held captive
for six days and subjected

19:25.033 --> 19:27.427
to extreme physical and
psychological torture.

19:27.470 --> 19:28.732
I'm sure no one
in this courtroom

19:28.776 --> 19:30.169
would blame you for bending

19:30.212 --> 19:31.561
to the will of someone you trust

19:31.605 --> 19:32.693
if they promised you
retribution.

19:32.736 --> 19:33.998
Is that a question, sir?

19:34.042 --> 19:36.392
Must be difficult...
to suddenly act as OIC

19:36.436 --> 19:39.439
to a man you have been
subordinate to for 13 years.

19:39.482 --> 19:41.702
As much as I respect
Master Chief Hayes,

19:41.745 --> 19:44.139
I respect
the chain of command more.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.880
It was my decision

19:45.923 --> 19:47.403
to take the op kinetic.

19:47.447 --> 19:49.013
The mission
was a success,

19:49.057 --> 19:50.276
as was the follow-on.

19:50.319 --> 19:51.668
And for the record...

19:51.712 --> 19:54.105
I killed Raqqa Jacques,

19:54.149 --> 19:55.716
not Jason Hayes.

No further questions.

20:06.596 --> 20:07.945
Your Honor,

20:07.989 --> 20:09.773
given that Chief Warrant Officer
Perry's testimony

20:09.817 --> 20:12.123
nullifies the revenge motive
for murder,

20:12.167 --> 20:14.430
I propose a motion to
dismiss all charges.

20:15.823 --> 20:19.043
I will dismiss the charge
of premeditated murder.

20:19.087 --> 20:20.871
But the members

20:20.915 --> 20:23.222
could still find for
involuntary manslaughter.

The witness may
be excused.

Losing motive puts a big hole
in the prosecution's case.

20:50.423 --> 20:52.381
But the involuntary
manslaughter,

20:52.425 --> 20:54.818

gets me ten years.

Still, there's no gun.

Our expert witness will poke
holes in the video evidence.

Expert witness?

I have to rely on
some computer geek

21:05.176 --> 21:07.266
to look for missing
camera angles here?

21:07.309 --> 21:08.354

said that video

makes me look
like a killer.

I need to tell my
side of the story.

21:12.140 --> 21:13.663
Putting you on the stand

three questions to get you

Master Chief,
United States Navy.

Navy Special Warfare
Development Group.

21:54.791 --> 21:56.967
Bravo Team Leader.It's your witness.

21:59.187 --> 22:00.928
Master Chief,
walk me through what happened

22:00.971 --> 22:02.538
in Irbid on 11 March.

22:02.582 --> 22:04.235
Bravo Team arrived
on target.

22:04.279 --> 22:07.761
My teammates
observed two men

22:07.804 --> 22:11.199
enter an apartment complex,
one shouldering an AK.

22:11.242 --> 22:13.244
Because they were armed,

22:13.288 --> 22:16.204
we entered the apartment complex
with our pistols drawn.

22:16.247 --> 22:18.467
Surely it was chaos the moment
you entered the building.

22:18.511 --> 22:20.513
How are you able
to recall what happened

22:20.556 --> 22:22.863
during such a kinetic operation?

22:22.906 --> 22:25.039
We're trained to do this.

22:25.082 --> 22:26.780
It's our job.

22:26.823 --> 22:29.478
We remain calm in the chaos.

22:29.522 --> 22:31.654
It's like time slows down.

22:31.698 --> 22:33.308
I led my team
up the stairs.

22:33.352 --> 22:34.918
I was the tip of the spear.
I rounded a corner.

22:34.962 --> 22:37.181
I looked up, I saw a male--

22:37.225 --> 22:39.270
black hair, track jacket.

22:39.314 --> 22:41.098
Had a gun on his side
in his left hand.

22:41.142 --> 22:44.058
It was a Beretta M1951.

22:44.101 --> 22:47.453
Before he could alert
the others, I shot him.

22:48.541 --> 22:52.022
I continued into the target,
and I completed my duty.

22:52.066 --> 22:53.894
No further questions.

22:53.937 --> 22:55.069
Is there cross-examination?

22:55.112 --> 22:56.766
Yes, Your Honor.

22:58.551 --> 22:59.987
So, Master Chief Hayes,
your duty,

23:00.030 --> 23:01.641
as you put it,
is to kill people?

23:01.684 --> 23:03.251
You got that backwards.

23:03.294 --> 23:06.210
My job is to save lives,
not take them.

23:06.254 --> 23:09.736
Like the hundreds of innocent
people that Bravo Team saved

23:09.779 --> 23:11.694
by stopping AKM terrorists

23:11.738 --> 23:12.956
from taking out
two commercial airliners.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.218
Speaking of
innocent people,

23:14.262 --> 23:15.916
I'd like to concentrate
on the very real,

23:15.959 --> 23:18.658
and very dead, unarmed
Jordanian citizen, Mr. Nafal.

23:18.701 --> 23:20.486
Is he the first unarmed man
you've killed?

23:20.529 --> 23:21.617
Objection.

23:21.661 --> 23:22.662
Sustained.

23:22.705 --> 23:23.706
How many people have you killed?

23:23.750 --> 23:24.707
That's not something
I think about.

23:24.751 --> 23:26.666
Is that because
after 20 years

23:26.709 --> 23:27.710
you've become
indifferent to killing?

23:27.754 --> 23:28.711
It's because
I know what it means

23:28.755 --> 23:29.843
to take a human life.

23:29.886 --> 23:32.411
Chief Warrant Officer Perry
testified

23:32.454 --> 23:34.413
that you learned
of the HVT's identity

23:34.456 --> 23:36.197
a few hours
before the Irbid op.

23:36.240 --> 23:38.329
That's correct.

23:38.373 --> 23:40.897
You rescued Warrant Officer
Perry from his torture chamber.

23:40.941 --> 23:43.117
You witnessed his ordeal,

23:43.160 --> 23:44.466
and his condition,
first hand?

23:44.510 --> 23:45.641
I did.

23:45.685 --> 23:47.774
That must have been difficult.

23:47.817 --> 23:50.298
If I had been in your position,
I would absolutely want justice

23:50.341 --> 23:51.560
for what was done
to my best friend.

23:51.604 --> 23:52.779
With all due respect, sir,

23:52.822 --> 23:54.128
you've never been
in my position.

23:54.171 --> 23:56.217
Are you telling me
this bombshell about the HVT

23:56.260 --> 23:57.784
didn't cause you to conflate
your personal feelings

23:57.827 --> 23:58.915
and your professional duty?

23:58.959 --> 24:01.048
It's always personal.

24:01.091 --> 24:02.441
The war on
terror started

24:02.484 --> 24:04.399
when 3,000
of our fellow Americans

24:04.443 --> 24:06.749
were killed on our own soil.

24:06.793 --> 24:08.490
They hit us,

24:08.534 --> 24:10.100
so we hit them back.

24:10.144 --> 24:12.146
There's nothing impersonal
about it.So you're admitting

24:12.189 --> 24:13.277
emotion clouded your judgment

24:13.321 --> 24:14.409
and led you to kill
an unarmed man?

24:14.453 --> 24:16.324
Mr. Nafal had a gun.

24:16.367 --> 24:18.631
Clearly a man willing to
compromise his morals to kill

24:18.674 --> 24:20.067
must be willing to lie, too.

24:20.110 --> 24:21.068
Objection.

24:21.111 --> 24:22.504
Overruled.

24:22.548 --> 24:24.463
Answer the question,
Master Chief.

24:26.900 --> 24:28.989
The war on terror has come
at a heavy price.

24:29.032 --> 24:31.600
It's cost me my family,

24:31.644 --> 24:34.124
my teammates, my marriage,

24:34.168 --> 24:37.432
seeing my kids grow up.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.739
But the one thing
that it hasn't taken from me

24:39.782 --> 24:42.829
is my honor and my word.

24:42.872 --> 24:47.355
I wouldn't disrespect
the Trident to protect myself.

24:47.398 --> 24:50.445
Lying would be
a betrayal to my men

24:50.489 --> 24:53.361
and the country I love to serve.

24:55.058 --> 24:57.321
I only have one more question.

24:57.365 --> 24:59.149
Master Chief Hayes...

25:01.108 --> 25:02.892

So, how did it go in court?

25:43.324 --> 25:44.630
Oh, it was all a joke.

25:44.673 --> 25:46.109
They kept picking apart
every minute of the day

25:46.153 --> 25:47.546
leading up to the op.

25:47.589 --> 25:48.982
Hardly anything
that really matters.

25:50.070 --> 25:52.289
Ah, maybe we should be
doing that.

25:52.333 --> 25:54.465
What?I mean,
maybe we've been

25:54.509 --> 25:56.424
so focused on the day
of the shooting

25:56.467 --> 25:58.861
that we've been missing
the whole picture.

26:01.385 --> 26:02.909

to the office.

26:02.952 --> 26:04.301
Uh, I'm s...
Don't wait up.

26:04.345 --> 26:05.999
No. Oh.
Sorry.

Ah, that's
a good last supper to have.

26:24.495 --> 26:26.715
It's not funny.It's a little funny,

26:26.759 --> 26:28.630

I think it's funny.

26:28.674 --> 26:30.893
JAG Williams called and said
Uncle Ray and your testimony

26:30.937 --> 26:33.156
made a big dent
in the prosecution's case.

Still have that,
uh, video evidence.

I just want you to know that,
you know, I did the right thing.

Never doubted that for a second.

Hmm?

You know, if I do go away,

times of things, Em.
Mm.

Okay.Come on, you're gonna be

Handle you going to jail? How?

Look, you're a strong,
young woman.

27:11.717 --> 27:13.240
You know what, you kept
this family together.

27:13.283 --> 27:14.241
after Mom.

27:14.284 --> 27:15.851
Okay.

27:15.895 --> 27:17.636
You've always been able to
manage without having me around

27:17.679 --> 27:18.985
most of your life.

27:19.028 --> 27:20.421
You-you kept the family
together.

27:20.464 --> 27:21.596
Why do you always
do that?

27:21.640 --> 27:22.728
What?

27:22.771 --> 27:24.381
Acting like
the only value you have is

27:24.425 --> 27:26.296

on the battlefield.

27:26.340 --> 27:28.385
I don't care what you think.
