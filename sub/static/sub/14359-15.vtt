WEBVTT

00:17.142 --> 00:19.478
Great pancakes, Dad.

00:20.479 --> 00:22.982
Oh, thanks.

00:23.022 --> 00:24.441
Hey, who's ready for seconds?

00:24.483 --> 00:25.901
(coughs)

00:25.943 --> 00:27.068

01:03.313 --> 01:05.106
So, which one

01:03.313 --> 01:05.106
of these pinks

01:05.148 --> 01:06.567
do you want

01:05.148 --> 01:06.567
to let float this month--

01:06.608 --> 01:08.109
cable or Visa?

01:08.151 --> 01:09.277
Oh, we can probably

01:08.151 --> 01:09.277
go without cable.

01:09.319 --> 01:10.571
You know,

01:09.319 --> 01:10.571
it might be fun.

01:10.612 --> 01:12.113
We'll get together

01:10.612 --> 01:12.113
as a family,

01:12.155 --> 01:13.323
play board games,

01:12.155 --> 01:13.323
sing songs.

01:13.365 --> 01:14.909
Okay, you made

01:13.365 --> 01:14.909
your point.

01:14.950 --> 01:16.410
We'll pay the cable.

01:16.451 --> 01:18.954
Oh... for crying

01:16.451 --> 01:18.954
out loud.

01:18.996 --> 01:20.372
The freezer's

01:18.996 --> 01:20.372
out again.

01:20.414 --> 01:21.289
What?!

01:21.331 --> 01:23.291
We just had that fixed.

01:23.333 --> 01:25.627
I know, the stupid

01:23.333 --> 01:25.627
piece of junk.

01:25.669 --> 01:26.420
Oh...

01:26.461 --> 01:28.047
It's only five

01:26.461 --> 01:28.047
years old.

01:28.087 --> 01:30.173
How could it keep

01:28.087 --> 01:30.173
breaking down?

01:32.091 --> 01:33.594
Aw, man!

01:33.635 --> 01:35.846
(screaming)

01:38.348 --> 01:40.225
I'll go get the ice chest

01:38.348 --> 01:40.225
from the garage,

01:40.267 --> 01:41.727
providing that still works.

01:41.769 --> 01:42.728
REESE:

01:41.769 --> 01:42.728
Nuh-uh!

01:42.770 --> 01:43.395
MALCOLM:

01:42.770 --> 01:43.395
Uh-huh!

01:43.437 --> 01:44.730
We'll let Mom settle this.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.231
The loser licks

01:44.772 --> 01:46.231
the tub drain.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.231
Deal.

01:46.273 --> 01:48.067
Mom, whose

01:46.273 --> 01:48.067
tongue's longer?

01:48.108 --> 01:50.151
(pounding on window)

01:50.193 --> 01:54.155
Are you going to make us

01:50.193 --> 01:54.155
stand out here all day?!

01:54.197 --> 01:56.157
Mom! Dad!

01:56.199 --> 01:58.035
(whispering):

01:56.199 --> 01:58.035
Oh, my God, honey!

01:58.077 --> 01:59.244
Your parents are here!

02:04.708 --> 02:07.168
Oh, God.

02:07.210 --> 02:10.547
Dewey, your grandparents

02:07.210 --> 02:10.547
are here.

02:10.589 --> 02:13.174
Hey, come on in.

02:13.216 --> 02:14.551
So, this

02:13.216 --> 02:14.551
is certainly

02:13.216 --> 02:14.551
unexpected.

02:14.593 --> 02:16.720
What brings you

02:14.593 --> 02:16.720
all the way down

02:14.593 --> 02:16.720
from Canada?

02:18.221 --> 02:19.974
Wait a minute,

02:18.221 --> 02:19.974
this can't be Reese.

02:20.015 --> 02:21.058
Yep.

02:21.100 --> 02:22.267
Uh, what's the matter with you?

02:22.309 --> 02:24.061
Don't you clean

02:22.309 --> 02:24.061
behind your ears?

02:24.103 --> 02:25.186
Look what I found!

02:25.228 --> 02:26.229
Ha-ha, five bucks!

02:26.271 --> 02:27.188
Thanks, Grandpa.

02:27.230 --> 02:28.189
(chuckles)

02:28.231 --> 02:30.358
So, Grandpa, did you

02:28.231 --> 02:30.358
have a nice drive down?

02:30.400 --> 02:33.695
Huh?

02:30.400 --> 02:33.695
I said, did you have

02:30.400 --> 02:33.695
a nice drive down?

02:33.737 --> 02:36.197
I can't hear this one.

02:33.737 --> 02:36.197
He sounds like girl.

02:36.239 --> 02:38.199
So, you just decided

02:36.239 --> 02:38.199
to hop in the car

02:38.241 --> 02:39.200
and drive on down

02:38.241 --> 02:39.200
from Canada

02:39.242 --> 02:41.202
without calling ahead, huh?

02:41.244 --> 02:42.203
How fun!

02:42.245 --> 02:43.998
Yeah, how long do you

02:42.245 --> 02:43.998
think you'll be staying?

02:44.039 --> 02:47.208
If we're such big

02:44.039 --> 02:47.208
inconvenience,

02:44.039 --> 02:47.208
we go right now.

02:47.250 --> 02:48.376
No.

02:47.250 --> 02:48.376
No, no, no, no, no.

02:48.418 --> 02:49.377
Please...

02:48.418 --> 02:49.377
Don't be silly.

02:49.419 --> 02:52.213
Uh, Dewey, you remember

02:49.419 --> 02:52.213
your grandparents,

02:52.255 --> 02:54.215
don't you, sweetie?

02:54.257 --> 02:56.217
He needs changing.

02:56.259 --> 02:58.095
He always needs changing.

02:58.137 --> 02:59.220
You take him.

02:59.262 --> 03:01.015
Ooh, let him sit in it.

03:01.056 --> 03:02.099
That will teach him.

03:02.141 --> 03:03.224
(laughs nervously)

03:03.266 --> 03:05.226
I don't want to take him;

03:03.266 --> 03:05.226
he smells.

03:05.268 --> 03:07.270
(baby crying)

03:07.312 --> 03:11.232
Ooh, that's what happens

03:07.312 --> 03:11.232
to little boys who squirm.

03:11.274 --> 03:12.860
Mmm...

03:14.193 --> 03:17.156
REPORTER:

03:14.193 --> 03:17.156
It's estimated that as many

03:14.193 --> 03:17.156
as 30,000 young people

03:17.196 --> 03:19.282
have descended on New Orleans

03:19.324 --> 03:21.535
to join in the annual

03:19.324 --> 03:21.535
Mardi Gras festivities.

03:21.576 --> 03:24.245
At this hour police have been

03:21.576 --> 03:24.245
called in to try and...

03:24.287 --> 03:26.540
Look at those animals

03:24.287 --> 03:26.540
going berserk,

03:26.581 --> 03:29.835
tearing each other's

03:26.581 --> 03:29.835
clothes off.

03:29.877 --> 03:30.544
Those are people

03:30.585 --> 03:32.253
with no respect

03:30.585 --> 03:32.253
for authority.

03:32.295 --> 03:33.714
Eric's right,

03:32.295 --> 03:33.714
that could be us.

03:33.755 --> 03:34.882
If we left right now

03:34.923 --> 03:36.925
we could be

03:34.923 --> 03:36.925
in New Orleans

03:34.923 --> 03:36.925
in five hours.

03:36.967 --> 03:38.259
How we going

03:36.967 --> 03:38.259
to get there?

03:38.301 --> 03:39.344
And where are

03:38.301 --> 03:39.344
we going to stay?

03:39.386 --> 03:40.888
Gentlemen, you

03:39.386 --> 03:40.888
quibble with me

03:40.929 --> 03:43.515
about logistics

03:40.929 --> 03:43.515
when I'm offering

03:40.929 --> 03:43.515
you 48 hours

03:43.557 --> 03:45.976
of non-stop debauchery?

03:46.018 --> 03:49.063
This could be the greatest

03:46.018 --> 03:49.063
weekend of our lives.

03:49.104 --> 03:52.066
(whimpering)

03:52.107 --> 03:53.067
Damn, Francis,

03:53.108 --> 03:54.026
you should have

03:53.108 --> 03:54.026
known better

03:54.068 --> 03:55.443
than to eat sushi

03:54.068 --> 03:55.443
at a truck stop.

03:55.485 --> 03:57.529
Hey, the cashier said

03:55.485 --> 03:57.529
the yellowtail was fresh.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.489
Besides, my octopus

03:57.571 --> 03:59.489
was excellent.

03:59.531 --> 04:02.201
Can we not talk about

03:59.531 --> 04:02.201
the fish, please?

04:02.242 --> 04:04.285
Guys, it's like a war zone

04:02.242 --> 04:04.285
out there.

04:04.327 --> 04:06.163
There's looting,

04:04.327 --> 04:06.163
rioting, and now

04:06.205 --> 04:08.289
the cops are turning

04:06.205 --> 04:08.289
a fire hose on the crowd.

04:08.331 --> 04:11.292
ALL:

04:08.331 --> 04:11.292
Wet T-shirts!

04:12.419 --> 04:14.462
(muffled coughing)

04:14.504 --> 04:16.131
Sorry about the takeout.

04:16.173 --> 04:17.925
I don't know what the deal

04:16.173 --> 04:17.925
is with the fridge.

04:17.966 --> 04:19.551
What do you expect?

04:19.593 --> 04:21.929
That brand is  dishufka.

04:23.722 --> 04:25.515
That's it.

04:25.557 --> 04:26.516
Fatten up on pizza.

04:26.558 --> 04:28.227
Good luck running

04:28.268 --> 04:31.438
when they come with

04:28.268 --> 04:31.438
the dogs and chase

04:28.268 --> 04:31.438
you into the hills.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.315
You know, I think

04:32.606 --> 04:34.315
it's great

04:34.357 --> 04:36.317
you're able to

04:34.357 --> 04:36.317
just hit the road

04:36.359 --> 04:37.694
without a care

04:36.359 --> 04:37.694
in the world.

04:37.736 --> 04:40.488
Oh... right...

04:37.736 --> 04:40.488
yeah, with me

04:40.530 --> 04:42.908
I'm always thinking

04:40.530 --> 04:42.908
about things back home.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.952
You know, did I

04:42.950 --> 04:44.952
leave the stove on?

04:44.993 --> 04:46.745
Is the iron plugged in?

04:46.787 --> 04:49.248
I once heard of a fire

04:46.787 --> 04:49.248
being caused by a mouse

04:49.289 --> 04:50.249
chewing through an...

04:50.290 --> 04:51.499
Where is my coffee?

04:51.541 --> 04:55.336
Uh, it's right here, Dad,

04:51.541 --> 04:55.336
just the way you like it.

04:55.378 --> 04:56.755
Mom, I really wish

04:56.797 --> 04:58.173
you'd put out that cigarette.

04:58.215 --> 04:59.340
It's not good

04:58.215 --> 04:59.340
for the kids.

04:59.382 --> 05:01.260
What, you think

04:59.382 --> 05:01.260
it'll stunt their growth?

05:01.301 --> 05:02.261
(sputters)

05:02.302 --> 05:03.386
You turned out big enough.

05:04.638 --> 05:07.348
Look at him eat,

05:04.638 --> 05:07.348
like animal!

05:07.390 --> 05:08.349
(laughs)

05:08.391 --> 05:09.184
Not like Mr. Pizza

05:09.226 --> 05:11.228
with knife and fork.

05:11.270 --> 05:12.395
You know, Dad,

05:12.437 --> 05:13.939
since the last time

05:12.437 --> 05:13.939
you were here,

05:13.981 --> 05:16.357
uh, Malcolm has been

05:13.981 --> 05:16.357
put into a special class.

05:16.399 --> 05:17.734
I'm not surprised.

05:17.776 --> 05:19.278
No, no, no, no,

05:17.776 --> 05:19.278
no, it's, uh,

05:19.319 --> 05:21.155
it's an advanced class.

05:21.196 --> 05:22.363
It's very challenging work.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.074
Tell him, Malcolm.

05:24.116 --> 05:25.993
Well, today we finished

05:24.116 --> 05:25.993
reading  Grapes of Wrath

05:26.034 --> 05:27.535
and we're studying

05:26.034 --> 05:27.535
advanced algebra.

05:27.577 --> 05:30.371
(shouting):

05:27.577 --> 05:30.371
What is that,

05:27.577 --> 05:30.371
shot at me?

05:30.413 --> 05:31.748
I no study algebra?

05:31.790 --> 05:33.750
It's because I go to war

05:31.790 --> 05:33.750
when I was your age.

05:33.792 --> 05:37.004
What good is math

05:33.792 --> 05:37.004
in war, huh?

05:38.421 --> 05:41.549
When you can provide

05:38.421 --> 05:41.549
for your family,

05:41.591 --> 05:46.847
you can have

05:41.591 --> 05:46.847
last piece of pizza.

05:47.681 --> 05:51.476
Dad, Hal provides

05:47.681 --> 05:51.476
for us just fine.

05:51.518 --> 05:54.395
Which isn't easy when someone's

05:51.518 --> 05:54.395
hogging all the pizza.

05:54.437 --> 05:56.564
You can't even keep food

05:54.437 --> 05:56.564
in the house

05:56.606 --> 05:58.399
for my grandchild.

05:58.441 --> 05:59.567
Do you call that providing?

05:59.609 --> 06:02.321
We will get

05:59.609 --> 06:02.321
the refrigerator fixed.

06:02.361 --> 06:03.655
For what, so

06:02.361 --> 06:03.655
it can break again?

06:03.697 --> 06:05.406
What does a new one cost?

06:05.448 --> 06:07.701
$700, $800?

06:07.742 --> 06:10.411
I give you $800

06:07.742 --> 06:10.411
to buy a new one!

06:10.453 --> 06:13.999
Thank God our generation knew

06:10.453 --> 06:13.999
to save our money, to hold onto.

06:14.041 --> 06:17.418
We didn't fritter it away

06:14.041 --> 06:17.418
on things like toys and dolls.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.796
I dressed up

06:17.460 --> 06:19.796
piece of wood

06:19.838 --> 06:21.422
and I was happy

06:19.838 --> 06:21.422
to have it.

06:21.464 --> 06:24.343
We will not take your money.

06:24.383 --> 06:26.136
Of course you will!

06:26.178 --> 06:27.888
We love you too much to stand by

06:27.929 --> 06:31.225
and watch your children

06:27.929 --> 06:31.225
grow up ashamed of you.

06:31.266 --> 06:33.143
This is what family

06:31.266 --> 06:33.143
is for.

06:34.393 --> 06:35.436
MALCOLM (over phone):

06:34.393 --> 06:35.436
Hello.

06:35.478 --> 06:36.813
FRANCIS:

06:35.478 --> 06:36.813
Malcolm, listen,

06:36.855 --> 06:39.024
I need to know what Mom

06:36.855 --> 06:39.024
used to put in the hot tea

06:39.066 --> 06:40.025
when we were sick.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.276
Is she around?

06:41.318 --> 06:43.444
I think she's changing

06:41.318 --> 06:43.444
the sheets on their bed.

06:43.486 --> 06:44.612
Grandma and Grandpa are here.

06:44.654 --> 06:46.447
(groaning):

06:44.654 --> 06:46.447
Oh, you're kidding.

06:46.489 --> 06:48.116
So, did they knock,

06:46.489 --> 06:48.116
or did you just hear

06:48.158 --> 06:50.118
their cloven hooves

06:48.158 --> 06:50.118
clatter up the driveway?

06:50.160 --> 06:52.453
I can't be sure,

06:50.160 --> 06:52.453
but I think Grandpa spit at me.

06:52.495 --> 06:54.455
Look, don't take it personally.

06:54.497 --> 06:56.833
They're primeval creatures

06:54.497 --> 06:56.833
with tiny little hearts.

06:56.875 --> 06:59.460
Yeah, but there must be

06:56.875 --> 06:59.460
some reason...

06:59.502 --> 07:01.462
Malcolm, they have

06:59.502 --> 07:01.462
stupid lizard brains.

07:01.504 --> 07:02.630
They're threatened by anyone

07:02.672 --> 07:05.050
with an ounce of ambition

07:02.672 --> 07:05.050
or intelligence.

07:05.092 --> 07:07.010
They'd eat you

07:05.092 --> 07:07.010
if they had better teeth.

07:07.802 --> 07:10.638
This one, always on phone.

07:10.680 --> 07:11.932
That's Grandpa, isn't it?

07:11.973 --> 07:14.475
Tell him I said he's

07:11.973 --> 07:14.475
a malevolent, poisonous troll.

07:14.517 --> 07:16.561
Francis says, "Hi."

07:16.603 --> 07:18.521
No-good delinquent.

07:18.563 --> 07:19.689
He says "Hi" back.

07:19.731 --> 07:22.483
LOIS:

07:19.731 --> 07:22.483
No, absolutely not.

07:22.525 --> 07:24.111
I will not let you

07:22.525 --> 07:24.111
take their money.

07:24.152 --> 07:25.486
Why not?

07:25.528 --> 07:26.863
Because they'll never

07:25.528 --> 07:26.863
let you forget

07:26.905 --> 07:28.489
that they had to give you $800.

07:28.531 --> 07:30.491
They'll use it to try

07:28.531 --> 07:30.491
to humiliate you.

07:30.533 --> 07:31.868
They do that now.

07:31.910 --> 07:34.662
Lois, come on, I know what

07:31.910 --> 07:34.662
your folks think of me.

07:34.704 --> 07:37.291
We  need  the fridge.

07:37.332 --> 07:41.502
We can't store the meat

07:37.332 --> 07:41.502
on the porch forever.

07:41.544 --> 07:44.047
I'm big enough to take one

07:41.544 --> 07:44.047
for the team.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.508
What?

07:47.550 --> 07:50.011
You're better than all of us.

07:51.846 --> 07:54.015
Oh...

07:54.766 --> 07:57.978
TOY:

07:54.766 --> 07:57.978
Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo!

07:58.019 --> 07:59.520
(sighs)

07:59.562 --> 08:02.190
We can't do this

07:59.562 --> 08:02.190
on Dewey's bed.

08:04.401 --> 08:06.403
Reese's looks okay.

08:07.570 --> 08:10.824
(ice clattering)

08:10.865 --> 08:12.326
Thank you.

08:12.367 --> 08:13.534
Hmm.

08:13.576 --> 08:15.412
Do you know this thing

08:13.576 --> 08:15.412
makes ice cubes

08:15.454 --> 08:16.913
in both circular

08:15.454 --> 08:16.913
and crescent shapes?

08:16.955 --> 08:18.539
How do they expect

08:16.955 --> 08:18.539
people to decide?

08:18.581 --> 08:19.540
Well, it's nice to have

08:19.582 --> 08:20.792
something in the house

08:19.582 --> 08:20.792
that works.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.127
Yeah.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.545
You know, maybe

08:22.169 --> 08:24.545
in their dark,

08:22.169 --> 08:24.545
twisted world,

08:24.587 --> 08:28.383
this is how your

08:24.587 --> 08:28.383
parents show love.

08:28.425 --> 08:30.551
Hey, Victor,

08:28.425 --> 08:30.551
pretty great, huh?

08:30.593 --> 08:32.137
My descending

08:30.593 --> 08:32.137
colon's inflamed.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.013
What's great?

08:33.054 --> 08:34.139
Uh, listen, Dad,

08:34.181 --> 08:34.848
I just mailed off

08:34.889 --> 08:36.141
the mortgage

08:34.889 --> 08:36.141
and car payments,

08:36.183 --> 08:38.268
and what with buying

08:36.183 --> 08:38.268
the new refrigerator and all,

08:38.310 --> 08:40.561
we should probably get

08:38.310 --> 08:40.561
that check from you right away.

08:40.603 --> 08:44.149
About that... your mother

08:40.603 --> 08:44.149
and I decided it's no good

08:44.191 --> 08:46.567
for family to give money

08:44.191 --> 08:46.567
to family.

08:46.609 --> 08:48.862
Always ends badly.

08:50.905 --> 08:51.739
Pulp!

08:51.781 --> 08:55.202
Who buys orange juice with pulp?

09:04.211 --> 09:04.878
How can they do this?!

09:04.919 --> 09:06.463
How can they just

09:04.919 --> 09:06.463
offer us money

09:06.505 --> 09:07.672
and then pretend

09:06.505 --> 09:07.672
it never happened?

09:07.714 --> 09:08.882
I am going to kill them.

09:08.923 --> 09:10.967
I swear I'm going to snap

09:08.923 --> 09:10.967
their necks like chickens!

09:11.009 --> 09:12.844
That is not going

09:11.009 --> 09:12.844
to pay off the debt, Lois.

09:12.886 --> 09:13.970
Unless you're

09:12.886 --> 09:13.970
a beneficiary

09:14.012 --> 09:15.638
on some sort

09:14.012 --> 09:15.638
of life insurance policy.

09:15.680 --> 09:16.639
What am I saying?

09:16.681 --> 09:17.807
Look, look,

09:16.681 --> 09:17.807
why don't we just

09:17.849 --> 09:19.600
return the refrigerator?

09:19.642 --> 09:21.061
I can't.

09:19.642 --> 09:21.061
I bought it on sale.

09:21.102 --> 09:22.603
Oh, Hal, what

09:21.102 --> 09:22.603
are we going to do?

09:22.645 --> 09:23.604
Well, what choice

09:22.645 --> 09:23.604
do we have?

09:23.646 --> 09:24.647
For the next

09:23.646 --> 09:24.647
couple of weeks,

09:24.689 --> 09:26.107
until we get caught back up,

09:26.149 --> 09:28.609
we're just going to have

09:26.149 --> 09:28.609
to work a ton of overtime.

09:28.651 --> 09:29.610
Oh, really?

09:29.652 --> 09:31.029
And who's going to look

09:29.652 --> 09:31.029
after the kids?

09:31.071 --> 09:34.533
So, we thought

09:31.071 --> 09:34.533
the perfect thing

09:31.071 --> 09:34.533
might be

09:34.574 --> 09:35.783
if you could stay

09:34.574 --> 09:35.783
a little longer

09:35.825 --> 09:38.412
and keep an eye

09:35.825 --> 09:38.412
on the kids.

09:38.453 --> 09:39.787
I don't know.

09:39.829 --> 09:42.623
Mother and I should go.

09:42.665 --> 09:45.126
We sense tension.

09:45.168 --> 09:47.128
No!

09:47.170 --> 09:48.296
Oh, no!

09:48.338 --> 09:49.630
(both laughing)

09:49.672 --> 09:51.299
Oh, no, no, no, there's

09:49.672 --> 09:51.299
no, there's no tension.

09:51.341 --> 09:53.885
We just, uh, we have

09:51.341 --> 09:53.885
a couple of hectic

09:51.341 --> 09:53.885
weeks coming up

09:53.927 --> 09:58.014
and we just hoped

09:53.927 --> 09:58.014
that you could stay

09:53.927 --> 09:58.014
a little longer.

09:58.056 --> 09:59.349
Of course.

09:59.391 --> 10:00.725
We do anything for you.

10:00.767 --> 10:02.227
We are a family.

10:02.269 --> 10:03.728
(chuckles)

10:03.770 --> 10:04.896
Oh, Dewey, hey, guess what.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.106
Grandma and Grandpa

10:06.147 --> 10:07.732
are going to stay

10:06.147 --> 10:07.732
and watch you guys

10:07.774 --> 10:09.859
for the next

10:07.774 --> 10:09.859
couple of weeks.

10:11.861 --> 10:13.572
(car engine starts)

10:17.492 --> 10:19.578
(ringing bike bell)

10:23.415 --> 10:24.665
(engine revs)

10:34.509 --> 10:36.136
How you doing, Francis?

10:36.177 --> 10:38.096
I need a doctor.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.847
We got you something better,

10:38.138 --> 10:39.847
man.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.724
We brought you beads!

10:41.766 --> 10:43.059
(all cheering and laughing)

10:43.101 --> 10:44.894
You wouldn't believe it

10:43.101 --> 10:44.894
out there, Francis.

10:44.936 --> 10:46.104
There's free beer

10:46.146 --> 10:48.356
and the women take

10:46.146 --> 10:48.356
their tops off

10:48.398 --> 10:49.732
when you give them beads.

10:49.774 --> 10:51.734
Is it possible we crashed

10:49.774 --> 10:51.734
our car on the way down here

10:51.776 --> 10:53.694
and died and went to heaven?

10:53.736 --> 10:56.281
I'd welcome death right now.

10:56.323 --> 10:59.451
I can't believe this is you

10:56.323 --> 10:59.451
talking, Francis.

11:00.535 --> 11:01.744
You're our leader.

11:01.786 --> 11:04.331
If it wasn't for you,

11:01.786 --> 11:04.331
we wouldn't even be here.

11:04.372 --> 11:06.707
You know what?

11:06.749 --> 11:07.917
You're right.

11:07.959 --> 11:09.628
This is Mardi Gras.

11:09.669 --> 11:10.629
I can do this.

11:10.670 --> 11:11.630
Yeah.

11:10.670 --> 11:11.630
All right.

11:11.671 --> 11:12.631
Give me those beads.

11:12.671 --> 11:14.382
Yeah!

11:12.671 --> 11:14.382
Come on!

11:14.424 --> 11:16.593
(all cheering)

11:16.635 --> 11:18.512
ALL (chanting):

11:16.635 --> 11:18.512
Francis! Francis!

11:18.553 --> 11:21.431
Francis! Francis! Francis!

11:21.473 --> 11:23.350
(Francis vomits, woman groans)

11:23.391 --> 11:24.767
(Francis groaning)

11:24.809 --> 11:28.729
Thank God we found a hotel

11:24.809 --> 11:28.729
with a drain in the hallway.

11:28.771 --> 11:31.899
We're back.

11:31.941 --> 11:33.734
Still no parents?

11:33.776 --> 11:36.321
If you're going to work

11:33.776 --> 11:36.321
all the time,

11:36.363 --> 11:38.739
don't have children.

11:38.781 --> 11:40.950
Hey, I wanted ice cream.

11:38.781 --> 11:40.950
I don't blame you.

11:40.992 --> 11:42.327
Why do they always do that?

11:42.369 --> 11:44.745
They take you for ice cream

11:42.369 --> 11:44.745
and stuff and never ask me.

11:44.787 --> 11:46.122
I've thought about that.

11:46.164 --> 11:50.168
And I think they see me as

11:46.164 --> 11:50.168
the protector of the bloodline.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.753
If the future's half as bad

11:50.210 --> 11:52.753
as Grandpa and I suspect,

11:52.795 --> 11:55.382
the only survivors are going

11:52.795 --> 11:55.382
to be mutants,

11:55.423 --> 11:57.925
cockroaches and me...

11:57.967 --> 12:00.470
all living underwater.

12:00.512 --> 12:04.057
Let's face it:

12:00.512 --> 12:04.057
they're backing a winner.

12:04.098 --> 12:06.851
Oh, man, I'm stuffed.

12:06.893 --> 12:09.688
I shouldn't have

12:06.893 --> 12:09.688
had a second one.

12:11.439 --> 12:13.191
(coughing)

12:18.530 --> 12:20.407
(coughing)

12:20.448 --> 12:22.783
Are you okay, Grandma?

12:22.825 --> 12:24.661
'Cause I could carry

12:22.825 --> 12:24.661
your purse for you.

12:24.703 --> 12:26.413
Or maybe your whiskey.

12:26.454 --> 12:30.791
I once strangled a border guard

12:26.454 --> 12:30.791
with my bare hands.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.168
Just asking.

12:32.210 --> 12:35.505
So, I studied about

12:32.210 --> 12:35.505
your country in school.

12:35.547 --> 12:36.839
Always with the books.

12:36.881 --> 12:39.718
You won't be happy till

12:36.881 --> 12:39.718
you get eye cancer.

12:39.758 --> 12:40.801
No, really.

12:40.843 --> 12:42.845
I found the folklore

12:40.843 --> 12:42.845
very interesting.

12:42.887 --> 12:45.181
And the history, the wars,

12:42.887 --> 12:45.181
the revolution.

12:45.223 --> 12:47.808
It must've been very hard

12:45.223 --> 12:47.808
for you growing up.

12:47.850 --> 12:50.811
It was.

12:50.853 --> 12:52.689
Very hard.

12:53.856 --> 12:56.276
Have a snort.

12:56.317 --> 12:58.194
Maybe later.

12:58.236 --> 13:00.488
(scoffs)

13:02.781 --> 13:04.242
Hey, look at

13:02.781 --> 13:04.242
the mama's boy.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.160
(laughing)

13:07.870 --> 13:09.830
You going to take that?

13:07.870 --> 13:09.830
What?

13:09.872 --> 13:11.249
Hey, you boys!

13:11.291 --> 13:13.042
Come back here

13:11.291 --> 13:13.042
and say that.

13:13.084 --> 13:14.835
Grandma, what

13:13.084 --> 13:14.835
are you doing?

13:14.877 --> 13:17.838
Who's this?

13:14.877 --> 13:17.838
Your 90-year-old bodyguard?

13:17.880 --> 13:19.840
No, no, it's okay.

13:19.882 --> 13:21.926
She's kidding.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.475
Nushkaya zibhat shinka!

13:30.477 --> 13:31.978
Ow!

13:33.896 --> 13:35.315
Grandma.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.109
Oh, geez.

13:39.902 --> 13:42.280
I don't know why you won't

13:39.902 --> 13:42.280
tell me who did this.

13:42.322 --> 13:45.533
You know, there's no honor

13:42.322 --> 13:45.533
in protecting a bully.

13:46.909 --> 13:48.869
Okay, it's your face.

13:48.911 --> 13:52.373
Mom, do you...?

13:54.292 --> 13:56.877
Do you like your parents?

13:56.919 --> 13:58.879
It doesn't matter

13:56.919 --> 13:58.879
how I feel about them.

13:58.921 --> 14:01.090
It's not like I can

13:58.921 --> 14:01.090
trade them in for someone else.

14:01.132 --> 14:02.883
You can't pick your parents.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.885
You're pretty much stuck

14:02.925 --> 14:04.885
with who you get.

14:04.927 --> 14:06.304
I know.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.142
Anyway, they're certainly

14:09.182 --> 14:11.142
not going to change.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.893
If things get too difficult,

14:12.935 --> 14:15.605
at least I can be grateful

14:12.935 --> 14:15.605
that soon they'll be gone.

14:15.647 --> 14:17.440
Back to their own home?

14:18.525 --> 14:19.900
Yeah.

14:19.942 --> 14:22.529
That's what I meant.

14:27.742 --> 14:29.536
Never thought

14:27.742 --> 14:29.536
I'd beat you home.

14:29.577 --> 14:32.121
They had us keep

14:29.577 --> 14:32.121
both registers open

14:29.577 --> 14:32.121
till midnight.

14:32.163 --> 14:33.914
What kind of idiot

14:32.163 --> 14:33.914
needs a beach ball

14:33.956 --> 14:35.916
at 11:00 at night?

14:35.958 --> 14:37.502
Did you make

14:35.958 --> 14:37.502
the kids' lunches?

14:37.544 --> 14:38.919
Oh, right.

14:37.544 --> 14:38.919
No, not yet.

14:38.961 --> 14:40.505
I've been kind of

14:38.961 --> 14:40.505
tied up here.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.923
You know, I discovered something

14:40.547 --> 14:42.923
kind of interesting, yeah.

14:42.965 --> 14:46.302
Now, it appears

14:42.965 --> 14:46.302
the circular cubes cool quicker,

14:46.344 --> 14:48.179
but the crescent ones

14:46.344 --> 14:48.179
last longer.

14:48.221 --> 14:51.932
Oh, for God's sake, Hal,

14:48.221 --> 14:51.932
will you quit playing around?

14:51.974 --> 14:54.018
That is a rectal thermometer.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.937
I'm going to go brush my teeth.

14:56.979 --> 14:59.106
You know, I ask you

14:56.979 --> 14:59.106
to do one simple thing.

14:59.148 --> 15:01.776
I can't do it all myself,

14:59.148 --> 15:01.776
you know?

15:10.243 --> 15:11.661
Hey.

15:11.703 --> 15:12.953
Are you upset

15:11.703 --> 15:12.953
about something?

15:12.995 --> 15:15.164
Look, I'm tired.

15:12.995 --> 15:15.164
I just got off a double shift.

15:15.206 --> 15:16.624
I want to go to bed.

15:16.666 --> 15:17.917
Sure.

15:17.958 --> 15:19.377
You just seemed a little

15:17.958 --> 15:19.377
snappish about the cubes.

15:19.419 --> 15:22.255
Because I'm tired of you

15:19.419 --> 15:22.255
not helping out around here.

15:22.296 --> 15:23.840
All right, Lois.

15:23.882 --> 15:26.760
I know we're both

15:23.882 --> 15:26.760
a little raw from

15:23.882 --> 15:26.760
the last five days,

15:26.801 --> 15:28.052
but that's no reason

15:28.094 --> 15:30.430
to dump your frustration

15:28.094 --> 15:30.430
with your parents onto me.

15:30.471 --> 15:31.472
On you?

15:30.471 --> 15:31.472
Oh, yes.

15:31.514 --> 15:32.973
Because that's what

15:31.514 --> 15:32.973
this is all about.

15:33.015 --> 15:34.225
You're angry at them

15:34.267 --> 15:36.644
and you're displacing

15:34.267 --> 15:36.644
your anger onto me.

15:36.686 --> 15:38.229
I mean, it is classic.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.356
Oh, I'm displacing, am I?

15:40.398 --> 15:42.901
Kind of like how you're

15:40.398 --> 15:42.901
focusing all your attention

15:42.942 --> 15:44.778
on that monstrosity

15:42.942 --> 15:44.778
in the kitchen?

15:44.819 --> 15:45.986
See, I knew it!

15:46.028 --> 15:47.280
You don't like

15:46.028 --> 15:47.280
the refrigerator.

15:47.321 --> 15:50.199
I hate that refrigerator.

15:50.241 --> 15:52.368
I hate its tubular handles.

15:52.410 --> 15:53.994
I hate the way

15:52.410 --> 15:53.994
it keeps the butter.

15:54.036 --> 15:55.996
I hate that, when

15:54.036 --> 15:55.996
I'm trying to sleep,

15:56.038 --> 15:57.457
I can hear it whirring.

15:57.498 --> 15:58.999
Oh, no, you can't.

15:59.041 --> 16:00.585
Yes, yes, I can.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.002
No. Not the 5100.

16:02.044 --> 16:04.004
That motor housing is

16:02.044 --> 16:04.004
four layers thick, Lois.

16:04.046 --> 16:05.047
Four layers.

16:05.089 --> 16:10.094
And it keeps things too cold.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.933
That is unfounded

16:11.971 --> 16:14.933
criticism, Lois.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.183
Unfounded and unfair.

16:16.225 --> 16:21.188
And until you apologize,

16:16.225 --> 16:21.188
I will be in the garage.

16:21.230 --> 16:24.442
IDA:

16:21.230 --> 16:24.442
I told you there was tension.

16:24.484 --> 16:25.568
(door slams)

16:33.952 --> 16:35.411
Hey, Grandma.

16:35.453 --> 16:37.288
Grandpa wanted to

16:35.453 --> 16:37.288
know if you could...

16:37.330 --> 16:38.038
Ow!

16:38.080 --> 16:39.206
What was that for?

16:39.248 --> 16:41.542
See, you not even try

16:39.248 --> 16:41.542
to defend yourself.

16:41.584 --> 16:43.043
Why are you so weak?

16:43.085 --> 16:45.045
I wasn't expecting

16:43.085 --> 16:45.045
for you to hit me.

16:45.087 --> 16:46.422
That's what

16:45.087 --> 16:46.422
they're counting on

16:46.464 --> 16:49.550
when they kick down your door

16:46.464 --> 16:49.550
in the middle of the night.

16:46.464 --> 16:49.550
Ow!

16:49.592 --> 16:51.344
Grandma, stop this.

16:51.385 --> 16:53.220
Come on, show me what you got.

16:51.385 --> 16:53.220
Come on, come on.

16:53.262 --> 16:55.055
Grandma, I'm not

16:53.262 --> 16:55.055
going to hit you.

16:55.097 --> 16:57.057
A kid should never

16:55.097 --> 16:57.057
have to say that.

16:57.099 --> 16:58.392
So how you going

16:57.099 --> 16:58.392
to fight these people

16:58.434 --> 17:00.227
when they throw you in the truck

16:58.434 --> 17:00.227
and take you away?

17:00.269 --> 17:01.896
You going to read to them?

17:01.938 --> 17:03.105
You going to impress them

17:01.938 --> 17:03.105
to death

17:03.147 --> 17:04.899
with your giant

17:03.147 --> 17:04.899
know-it-all brain?

17:04.941 --> 17:06.066
Huh?

17:06.108 --> 17:09.069
Look, I'm smart, okay?

17:06.108 --> 17:09.069
That's who I am.

17:09.111 --> 17:10.070
And if you don't

17:09.111 --> 17:10.070
like the fact

17:10.112 --> 17:12.072
that I'm taking

17:10.112 --> 17:12.072
high school math classes

17:12.114 --> 17:13.658
and reading great books,

17:13.700 --> 17:15.075
well, too bad.

17:15.117 --> 17:17.244
Because I'm going

17:15.117 --> 17:17.244
to be successful

17:15.117 --> 17:17.244
and maybe even rich

17:17.286 --> 17:19.288
because I am smart,

17:17.286 --> 17:19.288
okay?

17:19.330 --> 17:21.081
So just leave me alone.

17:21.123 --> 17:23.083
And I'm going

17:21.123 --> 17:23.083
to be just fine!

17:23.125 --> 17:24.251
Ow.

17:24.293 --> 17:25.085
Ha!

17:25.127 --> 17:27.714
I warned you

17:25.127 --> 17:27.714
about the eyes.

17:30.132 --> 17:32.010
What's this about?

17:32.051 --> 17:34.679
I want to show you

17:32.051 --> 17:34.679
something.

17:34.721 --> 17:37.097
Something just for you.

17:37.139 --> 17:41.185
I have waited many years

17:37.139 --> 17:41.185
for this moment,

17:41.227 --> 17:43.479
but now that

17:41.227 --> 17:43.479
you are old enough,

17:43.521 --> 17:46.900
I want to give you

17:43.521 --> 17:46.900
something

17:46.941 --> 17:48.985
close to my heart.

17:49.027 --> 17:50.110
Wow, is this stuff real?

17:50.152 --> 17:51.404
From the big war.

17:51.445 --> 17:54.741
Wow, is this a

17:51.445 --> 17:54.741
real gas mask?

17:54.782 --> 17:56.617
Gas mask, yes.

17:56.659 --> 17:58.118
Field glasses...

17:58.160 --> 17:59.913
chocolate K-rations.

17:59.954 --> 18:05.125
You get yourself nice girl

17:59.954 --> 18:05.125
with this, I tell you.

18:05.167 --> 18:07.127
This is so awesome,

18:05.167 --> 18:07.127
Grandpa.

18:07.169 --> 18:08.504
You're the best.

18:08.546 --> 18:10.548
This is so cool.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.633
God in heaven!

18:12.675 --> 18:13.718
What?!

18:13.760 --> 18:14.635
This is live grenade!

18:14.677 --> 18:17.013
Do not let go of handle

18:14.677 --> 18:17.013
or we both die.

18:17.055 --> 18:18.222
I don't want to die!

18:18.264 --> 18:19.139
Don't worry, you won't.

18:19.181 --> 18:22.142
All we have to do

18:19.181 --> 18:22.142
is find, find the pin.

18:22.184 --> 18:24.062
Find the pin,

18:22.184 --> 18:24.062
put the pin back in,

18:24.103 --> 18:25.980
and then everything

18:24.103 --> 18:25.980
will fine.

18:28.232 --> 18:31.069
Quit crying like baby.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.152
What's going on?

18:32.194 --> 18:33.529
Grandpa gave me

18:32.194 --> 18:33.529
a live grenade.

18:33.571 --> 18:35.656
It's really cool.

18:33.571 --> 18:35.656
You want to hold it?

18:35.698 --> 18:37.533
No, no, no.

18:35.698 --> 18:37.533
It's for you, not him.

18:37.575 --> 18:39.159
Oh, my God, we have

18:37.575 --> 18:39.159
to call the police.

18:39.201 --> 18:40.202
No, no police.

18:40.244 --> 18:42.162
No police, please.

18:42.204 --> 18:43.623
There's no reason to panic.

18:43.664 --> 18:45.165
Yes, there is.

18:45.207 --> 18:47.627
You gave Reese a live grenade,

18:45.207 --> 18:47.627
and he's a total idiot.

18:47.668 --> 18:48.795
He's right, I am.

18:48.836 --> 18:50.212
I don't think I should

18:48.836 --> 18:50.212
have it anymore. Here.

18:50.254 --> 18:52.172
No, you hold on to that.

18:52.214 --> 18:53.591
No, I'm tired of this game.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.384
I think what I really want

18:53.633 --> 18:55.384
to do is go lie down now.

18:55.426 --> 18:56.176
No!

19:08.272 --> 19:09.189
Hello.

19:09.231 --> 19:10.775
(explosion)

19:10.817 --> 19:12.068
What was that?

19:12.110 --> 19:13.611
What was what?

19:19.826 --> 19:21.368
What happened here?!

19:21.410 --> 19:22.870
We can't be sure.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.204
Grandpa gave me

19:22.912 --> 19:24.204
a live grenade

19:24.246 --> 19:25.247
and it was going to blow

19:25.289 --> 19:26.499
and I didn't mean

19:25.289 --> 19:26.499
to drop it.

19:26.540 --> 19:28.375
But Malcolm threw it

19:26.540 --> 19:28.375
in the fridge.

19:28.417 --> 19:31.378
You gave my son

19:28.417 --> 19:31.378
a live grenade?

19:31.420 --> 19:34.214
You brought live ammunition

19:31.420 --> 19:34.214
into this house?

19:34.256 --> 19:37.426
What is the matter

19:34.256 --> 19:37.426
with you people?!

19:37.468 --> 19:40.387
Are you completely insane?!

19:40.429 --> 19:42.932
You don't ever talk to us

19:40.429 --> 19:42.932
like that, do you hear me?

19:42.974 --> 19:46.060
Vuschka robotisch

19:42.974 --> 19:46.060
ber doya kraup.

19:46.102 --> 19:48.479
Mom, I-I...

19:48.521 --> 19:52.232
I just... I-I just

19:48.521 --> 19:52.232
mean that...

19:52.274 --> 19:53.233
All right, all right.

19:53.275 --> 19:55.235
Lois, take the boys

19:53.275 --> 19:55.235
in the other room.

19:55.277 --> 19:57.446
But, Hal...

19:55.277 --> 19:57.446
Now.

19:57.488 --> 19:59.073
Come on.

20:02.869 --> 20:05.913
Why don't we sit down?

20:10.751 --> 20:13.671
First off, I'm not here

20:10.751 --> 20:13.671
to try to sort out

20:13.713 --> 20:16.883
the complicated relationship

20:13.713 --> 20:16.883
you have with the woman I love.

20:16.924 --> 20:18.342
That's not my place.

20:18.384 --> 20:21.261
And I know it would be folly

20:18.384 --> 20:21.261
to try to put a price

20:21.303 --> 20:23.556
on the deep

20:21.303 --> 20:23.556
psychological trauma

20:23.597 --> 20:25.725
that you've caused Lois

20:23.597 --> 20:25.725
through the years.

20:25.766 --> 20:29.269
But let me take

20:25.766 --> 20:29.269
a stab at it anyway.

20:29.311 --> 20:31.522
$3,000 sound okay to you?

20:29.311 --> 20:31.522
What?

20:31.564 --> 20:33.649
Well, that would pretty much

20:31.564 --> 20:33.649
cover the fridge,

20:33.691 --> 20:36.861
the collateral damage,

20:33.691 --> 20:36.861
pay off a few credit cards,

20:36.903 --> 20:39.279
and finally get the transmission

20:36.903 --> 20:39.279
fixed on my car.

20:39.321 --> 20:41.199
Because of

20:39.321 --> 20:41.199
what just happened,

20:41.240 --> 20:43.951
you want us

20:41.240 --> 20:43.951
to loan you $3,000?

20:43.993 --> 20:47.914
Please, I know you're

20:43.993 --> 20:47.914
uncomfortable lending to family,

20:47.955 --> 20:50.833
so let's be clear.

20:52.543 --> 20:56.089
With one phone call, I could

20:52.543 --> 20:56.089
have your asses thrown in jail

20:56.130 --> 20:57.506
for child endangerment.

20:58.507 --> 21:03.470
So... this money

20:58.507 --> 21:03.470
I'm asking for, it's not a loan.

21:03.512 --> 21:06.306
It's blackmail.

21:06.348 --> 21:14.523
It's like your brother

21:06.348 --> 21:14.523
Vasclev all over again.

21:15.983 --> 21:17.735
Come on, Francis.

21:15.983 --> 21:17.735
We got to hit the road

21:17.777 --> 21:19.403
or we're not going

21:17.777 --> 21:19.403
to make bed check.

21:19.445 --> 21:20.738
I don't care.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.782
I came all the way

21:20.780 --> 21:22.782
to New Orleans,

21:22.823 --> 21:24.324
I got all these beads...

21:24.366 --> 21:27.327
I'm not leaving

21:24.366 --> 21:27.327
until I get some action.

21:31.958 --> 21:34.752
Now, if you don't mind,

21:31.958 --> 21:34.752
I need the room.

21:34.794 --> 21:36.378
Okay, I'm good.
