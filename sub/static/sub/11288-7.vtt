00:02.539 --> 00:04.274
ATTENTION, FREELOADERS!

00:04.276 --> 00:05.980
THE DINER IS
NOW CLOSED.

00:06.047 --> 00:07.382
GET OUT!

00:08.486 --> 00:11.525
DON'T EXPECT A TIP,
YOU MANGY LEPRECHAUN.

00:13.127 --> 00:14.428
COME ON, YOU GUYS.

00:14.497 --> 00:17.068
TODAY IS MY FIRST SHOT
AT WEDDING COORDINATING.

00:17.134 --> 00:19.807
MY CLIENTS HAVE USED
MY FAVORITE FOUR WORDS:

00:19.874 --> 00:21.276
"MONEY IS NO OBJECT."

00:21.342 --> 00:23.112
SO, WHEN THEY GET HERE

00:23.179 --> 00:25.450
EVERYTHING HAS GOT TO BE
TASTEFUL AND ELEGANT.

00:25.518 --> 00:26.820
FINE, REGINE.

00:26.887 --> 00:28.757
I WILL GREET YOUR GUESTS.

00:28.824 --> 00:30.159
JUST GIVE ME A MOMENT

00:30.226 --> 00:32.731
TO APPLY SOME WILDROOT
TO MY GOATEE.

00:32.798 --> 00:35.937
DO THE PEOPLE AT THE SOAP
KNOW YOU'RE MOONLIGHTING?

00:36.004 --> 00:39.444
THAT, MY DEAR,
IS HOW I GOT THE JOB.

00:39.512 --> 00:41.146
OUR STAR WAS FREAKING OUT

00:41.213 --> 00:43.485
BECAUSE HER SISTER'S
WEDDING COORDINATOR QUIT.

00:43.552 --> 00:45.856
SO I VOLUNTEERED
MY VAST EXPERIENCE.

00:45.923 --> 00:47.459
WAIT.

00:47.527 --> 00:51.466
SO YOU DEFINE EXPERIENCE AS
NEVER HAVING DONE IT BEFORE.

00:51.534 --> 00:52.869
( chuckling )

00:52.936 --> 00:55.173
EXCUSE YOU.

00:55.240 --> 00:57.344
BUT AT THE TENDER AGE OF TEN

00:57.410 --> 01:00.557
I WAS COORDINATING
THE WEDDING OF MY CHRISTI DOLL

01:00.624 --> 01:02.359
TO BLACK G.I. JOE.

01:02.426 --> 01:04.599
AND THEY ARE STILL TOGETHER

01:04.665 --> 01:08.070
DESPITE THAT SORDID INCIDENT
WITH WHITE KEN.

01:08.137 --> 01:11.678
( distorted doorbell ringing )

01:13.080 --> 01:16.486
OVERTON, WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH THAT DOORBELL?

01:18.323 --> 01:20.862
WELL, MAYBE THAT'S HOW
IT ALWAYS SOUNDS.

01:20.929 --> 01:23.768
OF COURSE, YOU NEVER USE IT.

01:42.169 --> 01:44.840
EDWIN? DAMIANA?

01:44.907 --> 01:46.342
IN THE FLESH.

01:46.409 --> 01:48.213

TAKE HIS DATES

02:27.399 --> 02:29.311
INTO THE PHOTOCOPY ROOM.

02:29.344 --> 02:33.838
I DON'T CARE IF HE DOES
LIKE THAT STROBE EFFECT.

DON'T WORRY.

THAT HEMORRHOID OPERATION.

02:43.355 --> 02:44.792
SHH!!

02:44.859 --> 02:47.931
WE AGREED WE WOULD CALL
MY HEMORRHOIDS "THEM."

02:47.997 --> 02:49.399
IT'S NOT AN OPERATION.

02:49.467 --> 02:50.970
IT'S A CONFERENCE.

02:51.037 --> 02:52.305
A CONFERENCE.

02:52.372 --> 02:53.776
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

02:55.879 --> 02:57.916
WELL, GUESS THIS IS IT.

02:57.983 --> 02:59.820
I'M ALL SET.

03:00.962 --> 03:02.499
ON MY WAY.

03:02.565 --> 03:04.068
OH, THAT'S MY GIRL.

03:04.135 --> 03:06.607
NEXT STOP, SNIPPETY‐SNIP.

03:07.909 --> 03:10.781
OH, DON'T MAKE ME GO
SNIPPETY‐SNIP!

03:10.848 --> 03:14.587
WHAT IF THEY KNOCK ME OUT,
AND I DON'T WAKE UP?

03:14.655 --> 03:16.190
I NEVER BEEN
UNCONSCIOUS BEFORE

03:16.257 --> 03:17.794
EXCEPT FOR IN COLLEGE.

03:17.861 --> 03:20.634
THAT WAS MY BAD, YOU KNOW.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.069
WHAT'S THIS?

03:22.135 --> 03:23.639
WHAT'S THIS?

03:23.705 --> 03:26.477
IS THIS THE SAME COUSIN
WHO, LAST NIGHT

03:26.544 --> 03:29.684
BEGGED ME TO FIND OUT
IF THERE WAS SUCH A THING

03:29.751 --> 03:31.118
AS PREPARATION "I" OR "J"

03:31.185 --> 03:33.523
BECAUSE YOU'D GONE
WAY PAST "H"?

03:35.962 --> 03:37.766
WHOA!

03:37.832 --> 03:38.433
OKAY. OKAY, I'LL GO.

03:38.500 --> 03:39.836
COME ON, NOW.

03:39.903 --> 03:41.639
EVERYTHING WILL BE
JUST FINE.

03:41.706 --> 03:43.008
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

03:43.075 --> 03:45.245
YOU DO HAVE A
WILL, DON'T YOU?

03:46.649 --> 03:48.185
TO BE HONEST, DAMIANA

03:48.251 --> 03:51.190
I BELIEVE THE WEDDING TRADITION
IS TO RELEASE DOVES

03:51.256 --> 03:52.760
NOT BATS.

03:55.231 --> 03:58.169
BUT I WELCOME ANY OTHER INPUT
THAT YOU TWO MIGHT HAVE.

03:58.236 --> 03:59.639
OH, VERY WELL.

03:59.707 --> 04:00.975
I'D LIKE TO WEAR

04:01.042 --> 04:03.253
MY GREAT‐GREAT‐GRANDMOTHER'S
WEDDING GOWN.

04:03.319 --> 04:05.925
I DUG UP THE VEIL
JUST THE OTHER DAY.

04:07.461 --> 04:08.830
SINCE SHE DIED

04:08.897 --> 04:12.070
THE OLD GIRL'S REALLY
LET HERSELF GO.

04:14.842 --> 04:16.845
DID SHE WEAR THAT
ON HER WEDDING

04:16.911 --> 04:18.548
OR TO HER FUNERAL?

04:18.615 --> 04:19.851
BOTH, ACTUALLY.

04:19.918 --> 04:22.089
IT WAS A
DOUBLE CEREMONY.

04:23.726 --> 04:26.096
ISN'T THE MATERIAL GORGEOUS?

04:26.162 --> 04:28.000
WELL, TO BE HONEST

04:28.066 --> 04:30.471
OOH, IT LOOKS A LITTLE SINGED.

04:30.538 --> 04:31.941
DAMNED VILLAGERS.

04:33.945 --> 04:35.547
OH, OBIE.

04:35.613 --> 04:36.883
UH, UH...

04:36.950 --> 04:40.791
YOU KNOW WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THE DOORBELL, OBIE?

04:40.858 --> 04:43.930
EITHER A SHORT CIRCUIT
ELSEWHERE IN THE BUILDING

04:43.996 --> 04:45.967
HAS CAUSED
A POWER SPIKE

04:46.034 --> 04:50.509
OR SUPERNATURAL FORCES
HAVE INVADED THESE VERY WALLS.

04:51.978 --> 04:53.782
OH, GOD.

04:55.251 --> 04:57.321
I MEAN, THE
CHURCH OF GOD.

04:57.388 --> 05:00.261
I‐I‐I LOVE THE ONE
THAT YOU'VE CHOSEN‐‐

05:00.327 --> 05:02.405
SAINT CHRISTINA'S.

05:02.471 --> 05:04.876
WE HAD OUR HEARTS SET ON
GETTING MARRIED

05:04.943 --> 05:07.347
ACROSS THE STREET
FROM THE CHURCH.

05:07.415 --> 05:08.951
BUT THAT'S
THE GRAVEYARD.

05:10.152 --> 05:12.524
WE'D LIKE TO PUT
THE DEEJAY

05:12.590 --> 05:13.960
NEAR THE MAUSOLEUM.

05:15.596 --> 05:17.567
THAT'S IT.

05:17.634 --> 05:19.102
I'M GOING TO
GET MY HAMMER

05:19.169 --> 05:20.705
AND A
WOODEN STAKE.

05:20.773 --> 05:22.308
DON'T‐DON'T GO.

05:22.375 --> 05:24.613
I MEAN, I'M
SERVING REFRESHMENTS.

05:25.783 --> 05:26.918
OKAY.

05:26.985 --> 05:28.454
I'LL TAKE A SODA.

05:34.198 --> 05:36.235
OR SOME HOLY WATER.

05:36.302 --> 05:39.240
I'LL HAVE A
CUP OF COFFEE.

05:43.182 --> 05:45.286
DECAF, PLEASE.

05:50.095 --> 05:51.698
WHERE THE HELL'S
KHADIJAH?

05:51.765 --> 05:55.004
I LEFT MY CAR PARKED
IN THE AMBULANCE ZONE.

05:55.070 --> 05:58.176
YOU PARKED IN
THE AMBULANCE <i>ZONE?</i>

05:58.243 --> 06:00.421
YEAH. THE HANDICAPPED SPOT
WAS TAKEN.

06:02.893 --> 06:05.363
UH, SURGEON, 11:00.

06:08.335 --> 06:09.973
NAME TAG.

06:10.039 --> 06:13.679
I CAN SPOT THE INITIALS
"M. D." FROM 45 PACES

06:13.745 --> 06:15.749
AND A FINGER
WITHOUT A RING

06:15.817 --> 06:17.019
FROM HALF A BLOCK.

06:20.794 --> 06:23.030
HEY, THERE SHE IS!

06:23.097 --> 06:24.600

06:27.472 --> 06:30.845

06:30.912 --> 06:32.581
PAGE DR. KEVORKIAN.

06:33.984 --> 06:36.022
DON'T YOU WORRY.

06:36.088 --> 06:37.458

NO MATTER WHAT.

06:37.525 --> 06:40.563
Woman:

ENTERTAIN THE TODDLERS.

MESS WITH MY BACKHAND.

07:38.112 --> 07:40.650
LET ME HELP YOU
WITH THESE.

07:40.717 --> 07:42.087
THEY ALWAYS MAKE
THESE THINGS

07:42.153 --> 07:43.522
MORE DIFFICULT
THAN NECESSARY.

07:43.589 --> 07:45.325
SIGN HERE.

08:09.711 --> 08:11.682
I'M A BIG FAN.

08:11.748 --> 08:12.885
SATCHEL PAIGE
WAS MY MAN.

08:12.951 --> 08:14.287
MY GRANDFATHER PLAYED
WITH SATCHEL PAIGE.

08:14.353 --> 08:15.556
FOR REAL?

08:15.623 --> 08:17.059
ABSOLUTELY.

08:17.126 --> 08:19.397
HE EVEN CLAIMED HE GAVE
SATCHEL HIS NICKNAME.

08:19.463 --> 08:20.732
UNTIL THEY MET

08:20.799 --> 08:22.268
HE CALLED HIMSELF
"DUFFEL BAG" PAIGE.

08:29.882 --> 08:32.187
OLD HAND AGAIN.

08:32.254 --> 08:35.092
I HAVE A PRETTY WONDERFUL
PRESCRIPTION FOR HAND THERAPY.

08:35.159 --> 08:39.635
IT INVOLVES POINTING OUT
ITEMS ON A MENU.

08:39.701 --> 08:42.039
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE
DINNER SOME TIME?

08:44.811 --> 08:47.650
YOU DON'T EVEN

09:14.807 --> 09:16.210

09:18.815 --> 09:20.218
BLEW ME OFF‐‐

09:20.285 --> 09:24.092
BLEW ME OFF
WITH SOME STORY ABOUT

09:24.159 --> 09:26.329
HAVING TO MASSAGE
SOMEBODY'S HEART.

09:28.501 --> 09:29.736
( woman screaming )

09:29.803 --> 09:32.340
ALL RIGHT, GIRL,
DON'T THINK ABOUT THE PAIN.

09:32.408 --> 09:33.677
JUST BREATHE.

09:33.743 --> 09:35.881
NO MATTER WHAT IT IS,
YOU CAN NAME IT MAX.

09:35.948 --> 09:37.718
SOMEBODY
GRAB HER DRAWERS.

09:38.520 --> 09:40.322
WELL, IT'S 5:00.

09:40.390 --> 09:42.259
GUESS THAT MEANS
I'LL GO HOME

09:42.326 --> 09:44.498
AND FIX ME
A ONE‐PERSON PIZZA.

09:44.564 --> 09:47.236
THEN I'LL LIGHT CANDLES
AROUND MY BATHTUB

09:47.303 --> 09:49.974
AND SOAK AWAY MY LONELINESS.

09:51.677 --> 09:53.114
FORGET IT, IVAN.

09:53.180 --> 09:55.485
KHADIJAH HAS HER FIRST DATE
WITH A DOCTOR

09:55.552 --> 09:57.055
SHE MET AT THE CONFERENCE.

09:57.122 --> 09:59.291
WHAT?!

09:59.358 --> 10:01.195
KHADIJAH, YOU GOT TO
GIVE ME A CHANCE.

10:01.262 --> 10:03.940
I GOT THE BASEMENT
ALL TO MYSELF THIS WEEKEND.

10:04.008 --> 10:05.979
OH, MAN.

10:06.045 --> 10:07.747
HI.

10:07.814 --> 10:10.487
YOU'RE ON TIME,
AND YOU BROUGHT ROSES.

10:10.553 --> 10:12.857
YOU WANT YOUR
PEN BACK, DON'T YOU?

10:12.924 --> 10:14.027
MMM.

10:14.094 --> 10:15.862
UH. OH. OW!

10:15.929 --> 10:20.071
WHAT, TOO MUCH TROUBLE
TO DETHORN THEM, BROTHER?

10:20.138 --> 10:21.908
THOSE'LL
HURT HER, MAN.

10:22.943 --> 10:26.383
ANY SPECIAL PLACE
YOU'D LIKE TO GO TO DINNER?

10:26.450 --> 10:28.721
WELL, THERE'S THIS NEW
CAJUN RESTAURANT

10:28.787 --> 10:30.324
CALLED TONY'S ETOUFE.

10:30.391 --> 10:32.795
SYNCLAIRE, SEE IF YOU CAN
GET RESERVATIONS AT TONY'S.

10:32.862 --> 10:34.064
SURE THING.

10:35.099 --> 10:37.237
WHOA. THAT PROBABLY WOULDN'T
BE A GOOD IDEA.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.642
CAJUN FOOD IS SPICY

10:39.708 --> 10:42.447
AND IT PROBABLY WOULDN'T
BE GOOD FOR...

10:42.513 --> 10:44.717
YOU KNOW.

10:46.821 --> 10:48.358
I KNOW WHAT?

10:49.461 --> 10:51.329
YOUR HEMORRHOIDS.

10:51.397 --> 10:53.501
( loudly ):
KHADIJAH GOT HEMORRHOIDS?!

10:59.446 --> 11:01.322
AND YOU KNOW ABOUT THEM?

11:01.389 --> 11:03.259
WHAT WERE YOU DOING
AT THE CONFERENCE?

11:08.161 --> 11:09.095
EXCUSE ME, PLEASE.

11:09.162 --> 11:10.164
AH, NO, MY BROTHER. NO.

11:11.387 --> 11:13.091
WHEN KHADIJAH
CLOSES THAT DOOR

11:13.157 --> 11:14.760
IT DOESN'T OPEN FOR ANYONE.

11:14.827 --> 11:16.163
SHE'S SEALED IN THERE

11:16.230 --> 11:18.634
LIKE AN INDIVIDUALLY
WRAPPED MOON PIE.

11:20.738 --> 11:23.176
YOU... IN HERE.

11:23.243 --> 11:24.513
DON'T GO, MAN.

11:24.579 --> 11:25.915
IT'S A TRICK.

11:30.424 --> 11:33.094
WHY DIDN'T YOU WANT
TO TELL ME, BOO? HUH?

11:35.098 --> 11:37.202
HEY, COME ON,
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

11:37.269 --> 11:38.639
GIVE YOU A SPONGE BATH?

11:38.705 --> 11:39.807
BRING YOU A PILLOW?

11:39.874 --> 11:41.144
SERVE AS YOUR CUSHION?

11:41.210 --> 11:43.214
IVAN, GET OUT.

11:43.281 --> 11:45.152
SEE, I KNOW
THAT'S THE PAIN TALKING

11:45.218 --> 11:46.554
SO I'M...

11:52.766 --> 11:57.641
HOW DID YOU KNOW
ABOUT MY "THEM"?

11:57.708 --> 11:59.645
DOES THIS SOUND FAMILIAR?

11:59.712 --> 12:04.059
"PLEASE COUNT BACKWARDS
FROM 100."

12:07.600 --> 12:09.938
YOU'RE MY ANESTHESIOLOGIST?

12:10.004 --> 12:11.642
I WASN'T GOING TO SAY A WORD

12:11.708 --> 12:14.212
BUT THEN YOU BROUGHT UP
THAT SPICY FOOD

12:14.279 --> 12:17.017
AND I DON'T THINK YOU WANT TO
EAT THAT WHEN YOU'VE GOT THEM.

12:17.084 --> 12:18.855
IT'LL GIVE YOU A BAD CASE
OF THOSE

12:18.921 --> 12:20.659
AND I DON'T THINK YOU WANT THAT.

12:20.725 --> 12:25.801
YOU SEE MY BEHIND AND I DON'T
EVEN KNOW YOUR ZODIAC SIGN.

12:27.371 --> 12:28.640
CANCER.

12:28.707 --> 12:30.610
AND MY NAME IS CHARLES.

12:30.677 --> 12:32.112
COME ON,
COME ON.

12:32.180 --> 12:34.284
KHADIJAH,
IN THE OPERATING ROOM

12:34.350 --> 12:37.323
ALL BACKSIDES LOOK
THE SAME TO ME.

12:37.390 --> 12:40.094
EXCEPT FOR THAT OLD GUY
FROM PITTSBURGH.

12:40.161 --> 12:41.431
NOW, HE...

12:41.498 --> 12:43.568
BUT YOU WOULDN'T WANT
TO HEAR ABOUT THAT

12:43.635 --> 12:44.904
RIGHT BEFORE DINNER.

12:44.970 --> 12:47.576
MAYBE WE SHOULD SKIP DINNER.

12:47.643 --> 12:52.318
IN FACT, I DON'T THINK I'LL BE
HUNGRY FOR TWO TO THREE YEARS.

12:52.384 --> 12:55.056
YOU KNOW, KHADIJAH,
JUST BECAUSE I'M AN EXPERT

12:55.123 --> 12:57.393
AT MAKING PEOPLE NUMB,
DOESN'T MEAN I...

12:57.461 --> 12:59.965
I DON'T FEEL PAIN.

13:00.032 --> 13:03.245
YOU REALLY REACHED OUT
FOR THAT ONE.

13:03.312 --> 13:04.347
( laughs )

13:04.415 --> 13:06.184
YOU KEEP SAYING NO,
I'LL GET CORNY.

13:06.250 --> 13:08.254
NO. I DON'T THINK I COULD TAKE

13:08.321 --> 13:10.893
THAT MUCH PAIN
TWICE IN ONE WEEK.

13:10.959 --> 13:12.930
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

13:12.997 --> 13:14.867
GREAT.

13:14.934 --> 13:16.135
NOW, HOW DO WE
GET OUT OF HERE

13:16.203 --> 13:18.441
WITHOUT RUNNING INTO
THAT LITTLE EAVESDROPPER?

13:18.508 --> 13:20.010
Ivan:
I HEARD THAT.

13:22.649 --> 13:25.787
YEP, THERE'S DEFINITELY
SOMETHING SINISTER GOING ON

13:25.854 --> 13:28.158
WITH THE BRIDE
AND GROOM OF DOOM.

13:28.226 --> 13:29.495
FIRST OF ALL

13:29.562 --> 13:30.964
THE DOORBELL'S WARPED.

13:31.031 --> 13:32.968
THEN THE PHONE GOES OUT

13:33.035 --> 13:36.975
AND ALL DAY LONG, I HAD
A HANKERING FOR DEVILED HAM.

13:37.042 --> 13:40.382
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT IS.

13:40.450 --> 13:43.488
OVERTON, THERE IS A HUGE SPIDER
IN MY BEDROOM

13:43.555 --> 13:46.427
AND I COULD SWEAR
IT SPUN A WEB THAT SAID...

13:46.494 --> 13:49.198
( deeply ):
"GET OUT."

13:49.266 --> 13:50.535
ALL RIGHT.

13:50.602 --> 13:53.105
I'M GOING TO GO ON UP
AND CHECK THIS OUT.

13:53.172 --> 13:54.942
NOW, IF YOU HEAR ME SCREAMING

13:55.009 --> 13:57.682
I EITHER BRUISED MY SHIN
OR I GOT COCOONED.

13:59.017 --> 14:00.453
MAN, THAT IS IT.

14:00.520 --> 14:03.131
I'M NOT DOING THIS
COCKAMAMIE WEDDING FROM HELL.

14:03.197 --> 14:05.302
( phone ringing )

14:05.369 --> 14:06.972
HELLO.

14:07.039 --> 14:09.910
SPEAK OF THE DEVIL.

14:12.048 --> 14:13.618
THIS IS REGINE.

14:13.685 --> 14:14.820
THANKS.

14:14.887 --> 14:16.089
UH... YEAH.

14:16.156 --> 14:18.894
MAY THE DEAD RISE UP
AND MEET YOU TOO.

14:21.165 --> 14:23.169
THEY ARE TRIPLING MY FEE.

14:23.235 --> 14:27.411
THEY LOVED MY IDEA OF THROWING
THE BOUQUET INTO AN OPEN GRAVE.

14:29.013 --> 14:32.854
YEAH, REGINE, THAT WAS
A DIABOLICAL‐LOOKING SPIDER

14:32.921 --> 14:37.663
BUT NEAR AS I CAN MAKE OUT,
THE WEB SAID, "BOSS HAWG."

14:37.730 --> 14:40.034
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH THAT PHONE?

14:40.101 --> 14:42.272
YOU KNOW
IT'S DISCONNECTED.

14:45.110 --> 14:48.618
REGINE, LOOKS LIKE YOUR
CALLING CIRCLE INCLUDES SATAN.

14:49.986 --> 14:51.924
( both laughing )

14:51.990 --> 14:53.661
YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER BEEN

14:53.728 --> 14:55.931
TO THE GREENWICH VILLAGE
HALLOWEEN PARADE.

14:55.997 --> 14:58.268
I MUST HAVE COUNTED
ABOUT 15 LADY GODIVAS.

14:58.336 --> 15:00.874
AT LEAST TWO OF
THEM WERE WOMEN.

15:00.941 --> 15:03.852
( both laughing )

15:03.919 --> 15:05.456
AH, MAN.

15:11.835 --> 15:14.372
WELL, UM...

15:14.440 --> 15:17.846
I, UH, HOPE YOU HAD
A GOOD TIME.

15:17.913 --> 15:19.081
I DID.

15:19.148 --> 15:20.752
I REALLY, REALLY DID.

15:20.819 --> 15:22.388
WELL, UM...

15:22.455 --> 15:24.224
GOOD NIGHT.

15:24.290 --> 15:25.828
I LOOK FORWARD
TO SEEING YOU

15:25.894 --> 15:28.333
AT THE HOSPITAL CHARITY
CARNIVAL THIS WEEKEND.

15:28.400 --> 15:29.868
OH, COOL.
I'LL SEE YOU THEN.

15:29.935 --> 15:31.103
OKAY.

15:35.480 --> 15:36.882
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

15:36.949 --> 15:39.454
YOU KNOW, KHADIJAH,
I JUST RAN INTO YOUR FRIEND

15:39.520 --> 15:42.224
AND I'M ASTONISHED TO SAY
THAT I ACTUALLY LIKE HIM.

15:42.291 --> 15:44.497
YOU KNOW, HE'S NOT
YOUR AVERAGE SCHLEPROCK.

15:44.564 --> 15:49.004
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THE AVERAGE SCHLEPROCK.

15:49.071 --> 15:51.008
( sighs )

15:51.075 --> 15:53.714
SO, KHADIJAH,
IS DR. CHARLES

15:53.781 --> 15:55.418
YOUR R. X. FOR LOVE?

15:55.485 --> 15:57.086
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW.

15:57.152 --> 16:00.092
I MEAN, WE'VE GONE OUT
THREE TIMES

16:00.158 --> 16:03.038
IN THE PAST TWO WEEKS,
AND IT'S ALWAYS GREAT

16:03.104 --> 16:05.544
BUT WHEN HE MOVES IN
FOR THAT KISS

16:05.610 --> 16:08.080
ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT
IS HOW WE MET.

16:08.147 --> 16:13.257
I MEAN, HE DIDN'T EXACTLY SEE
MY BEST SIDE.

16:13.323 --> 16:14.926
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN, GIRL.

16:14.993 --> 16:17.230
I COULD NEVER DATE
MY GYNECOLOGIST.

16:17.297 --> 16:20.772
IF WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT
THE PEOPLE YOU COULD NOT DATE

16:20.838 --> 16:23.042
ALLOW ME TO RETRIEVE
A PHONE BOOK.

16:25.045 --> 16:27.951
SO CHARLES SAW YOU
WITH YOUR PANTS DOWN.

16:28.018 --> 16:31.459
IF I HAD A NICKEL
FOR EVERY TIME I WAS EMBARRASSED

16:31.526 --> 16:36.468
I COULD BUY A BIG HOUSE, A CAR,
ONE OF THOSE RIDING MOWERS.

16:36.535 --> 16:39.808
MAYBE WITH A LITTLE SIDECAR
FOR OBIE, YOU KNOW.

16:39.874 --> 16:42.613
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING.

16:42.679 --> 16:45.785
I'M PROUD TO SAY I DON'T.

16:45.852 --> 16:48.925
OKAY. MAYBE IT WOULD HELP
IF YOU IMAGINE CHARLES

16:48.991 --> 16:51.463
IN SOME EQUALLY EMBARRASSING
SITUATION.

16:51.530 --> 16:54.367
UH, MAYBE‐MAYBE SITTING
ON THE JOHN

16:54.436 --> 16:57.575
WEARING, UH... I DON'T KNOW‐‐
ANTLERS, HIP BOOTS.

16:57.642 --> 16:58.910
I DON'T KNOW.

16:58.977 --> 17:00.947
THAT'S GOOD

17:01.013 --> 17:04.994
BUT I THINK I'M GOING TO NEED
SOMETHING EVEN MORE RIDICULOUS.

17:05.060 --> 17:06.598
Maxine:
KYLE

17:06.665 --> 17:09.404
TELL KHADIJAH WHAT KIND
OF DRAWERS YOU WEAR.

17:15.715 --> 17:17.084
NOTHING FANCY.

17:17.151 --> 17:18.787
JUST, UH, FRENCH BOXERS

17:18.854 --> 17:21.660
WITH A FRONT PLEAT
AND ADJUSTABLE WAISTBAND.

17:21.727 --> 17:22.994
SILK, OF COURSE.

17:23.061 --> 17:24.766
WHY?

17:24.833 --> 17:27.301
THAT JUST MAY WORK.

17:30.844 --> 17:32.112
COME ON, COME ON.

17:32.179 --> 17:34.518
AW..!
OH..!

17:34.585 --> 17:35.853
AH, MAN!

17:35.919 --> 17:38.357
OH, MAN, ROBBED AGAIN.

17:38.425 --> 17:40.027
YOU HAVING A GOOD TIME?

17:40.094 --> 17:41.865
THIS IS THE
STRANGEST CARNIVAL

17:41.931 --> 17:43.200
I HAVE EVER BEEN TO.

17:43.267 --> 17:45.236
I LIKE THE "GUESS
YOUR CHOLESTEROL" BOOTH

17:45.303 --> 17:46.474
BUT I AM GLAD I PASSED

17:46.540 --> 17:48.342
ON THAT MYSTERY ORGANS
SQUEEZE BOX.

17:48.410 --> 17:50.915
TELL YOU WHAT,
YOU WANT TO GO VISIT

17:50.982 --> 17:52.586
THE KISSING BOOTH?

17:52.652 --> 17:54.220
THEY GOT A KISSING BOOTH?

17:54.287 --> 17:57.427
NO. BUT GIVE ME A BUCK
AND WE COULD START ONE UP.

18:09.222 --> 18:11.694
KHADIJAH, COME ON,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:11.761 --> 18:14.031
I MEAN, IF IT'S MY BREATH,
YOU KNOW, JUST TELL ME.

18:14.098 --> 18:16.737
I'LL BREATHE AFTER THE DATE.

18:16.804 --> 18:18.073
LOOK, LOOK, CHARLES

18:18.139 --> 18:20.545
LET'S DEAL WITH
THE REAL, OKAY?

18:20.611 --> 18:22.548
NOW, THE FIRST TIME WE MET

18:22.615 --> 18:24.552
IT WASN'T EXACTLY
FACE TO FACE.

18:24.619 --> 18:26.221
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

18:26.288 --> 18:28.727
I'M HAVING A LITTLE PROBLEM
GETTING PAST THAT.

18:28.794 --> 18:31.063
SO WOULD IT MAKE YOU
FEEL ANY BETTER

18:31.130 --> 18:33.267
IF I DROP MY PANTS
AND PASSED OUT?

18:33.334 --> 18:36.408
I TRIED THAT IN MY HEAD,
BUT THE ANTLERS GOT IN THE WAY.

18:36.475 --> 18:38.412
THE...

18:38.479 --> 18:41.316
I TELL YOU WHAT, W‐W‐WE STILL
GOT A LOT OF TICKETS.

18:41.383 --> 18:43.086
WHY DON'T WE GO OVER THERE

18:43.153 --> 18:45.692
AND COUNT THE EYEBALLS
OUT IN THE JAR, OKAY?

18:45.759 --> 18:47.529
( laughing )

18:47.595 --> 18:49.633
WELL, THE BATTING
CAGE IS OPEN.

18:49.699 --> 18:52.203
I MEAN, WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE A FEW SWINGS?

18:52.270 --> 18:53.541
OH, NO, NO, NO.

18:53.607 --> 18:55.545
YOU GO AHEAD.

18:55.611 --> 18:57.781
NOW, YOU KNOW I CAN'T...

18:59.116 --> 19:02.664
GET IN THERE AND MAKE
YOUR GRANDDADDY PROUD.

19:02.731 --> 19:05.068
OKAY.

19:05.135 --> 19:06.971
SATCHEL PAIGE, LOOK OUT.

19:10.445 --> 19:13.017
ALL RIGHT NOW,
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT.

19:24.270 --> 19:26.174
( mouthing words )

19:27.309 --> 19:29.280
( mouthing words )

19:38.264 --> 19:39.367
( grunts )

19:43.339 --> 19:45.545
THAT MACHINE...
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

19:45.612 --> 19:47.649
THE MACHINE
WASN'T THROWING THEM

19:47.716 --> 19:49.587
OVER THE PLATE.

19:51.054 --> 19:54.094
I SAID A FAST BALL!

19:54.160 --> 19:57.100
( laughing )

19:57.166 --> 19:58.870
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.

19:58.937 --> 20:00.873
NOW YOU KNOW MY SECRET, HUH?

20:00.940 --> 20:03.217
I'M A LITTLE
ATHLETICALLY CHALLENGED.

20:03.284 --> 20:04.888
I WANTED TO BE A SURGEON

20:04.955 --> 20:06.859
BUT I KEPT DROPPING
THE SCALPEL.

20:06.925 --> 20:08.194
( laughing )

20:08.261 --> 20:09.529
IT'S OKAY.

20:09.597 --> 20:12.435
( both laughing )

20:12.502 --> 20:13.471
OH, MAN.

20:13.537 --> 20:14.974
DANG. YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:15.040 --> 20:18.480
KNOWING THAT YOU'RE A KLUTZ,
KIND OF MAKES ME FEEL BETTER

20:18.546 --> 20:20.249
ABOUT THE WAY
WE STARTED OUT.

20:20.316 --> 20:21.486
REALLY?

20:21.552 --> 20:23.657
IN THAT CASE,
I SUCK AT FOOTBALL.

20:23.724 --> 20:26.095
I CAN'T CHANGE A FLAT
TO SAVE MY LIFE

20:26.161 --> 20:29.668
AND I ACTUALLY SPRAINED MY
ANKLE ONCE PLAYING DOMINOES.

20:29.735 --> 20:31.004
WHAT'S NEXT?

20:31.070 --> 20:34.712
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED
A HELMET TO MAKE TOAST?

20:34.778 --> 20:37.516
WHATEVER WORKS FOR YOU.

20:49.038 --> 20:51.977
DAMN, YOU DON'T KISS
LIKE A KLUTZ.

20:52.044 --> 20:55.550
I CAN ALWAYS USE A
LITTLE MORE PRACTICE.

21:06.669 --> 21:08.035
<i>WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.</i>

21:13.333 --> 21:15.203
HEY! SO HOW WAS
THE WEDDING?

21:15.269 --> 21:16.539
FABULOUS.

21:16.607 --> 21:19.577
I KNOCKED THEM EVEN DEADER.

21:19.645 --> 21:20.513
SO WHAT'S
IN THE BOX?

21:20.579 --> 21:23.986
A GIFT FROM THE GHOULY‐WEDS.

21:25.188 --> 21:27.360
AH... "TO REGINE, WITH THANKS

21:27.427 --> 21:29.764
FOR MAKING OUR SPECIAL DAY
A LIVING HELL."

21:31.434 --> 21:33.203
( rattling noise )

21:33.270 --> 21:35.107
OH, MY GOD.

21:36.878 --> 21:38.447
WHAT?
