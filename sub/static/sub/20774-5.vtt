16:25.401 --> 16:27.361
Smooth passage, I assume?

16:27.444 --> 16:28.362
Perfect.

16:28.445 --> 16:30.948
No one knows the local sea routes
like my partner.

16:32.449 --> 16:33.283
How about a drink?

16:33.617 --> 16:34.910
Rum, no?

16:35.494 --> 16:38.622
Havana Club ,15 year.
Wanna do the honors, Kevin?

16:39.373 --> 16:40.457
[Esteban] You must join us.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.084
No, I don't drink.

16:42.167 --> 16:43.669
One of the reasons I trust him.

16:45.963 --> 16:48.173
-To free trade.
-Salud.

16:50.092 --> 16:51.051
Mateo.

16:57.057 --> 16:59.101
[Roy] What you're paying for is
in the next room.

16:59.768 --> 17:00.936
Wanna join us, Kevin?

17:01.020 --> 17:03.230
I, uh-- I really gotta get home, Roy.

17:03.313 --> 17:05.524
-Of course, family calls.
-Heh.

17:05.607 --> 17:09.361
Well, how about taking our friends out
for a little deep sea fishing later today?

17:09.903 --> 17:11.905
-Wow. [laughs]
-World's best.

17:11.989 --> 17:13.699
I don't know if I can get the boat...

17:14.033 --> 17:15.701
-that quickly.
-[Roy] Would you excuse us?

17:15.784 --> 17:17.119
-Gentlemen.
-[speaks in Spanish]

17:17.202 --> 17:18.328
I'll be right in.

17:19.371 --> 17:21.707
Uh... Roy, I gotta get going.

17:24.043 --> 17:25.461
Listen, Roy, I'm sorry, but--

17:25.544 --> 17:29.089
You remember I told you I wanted you
to take on more responsibility?

17:29.173 --> 17:32.134
-Yeah.
-This isn't just about the boatyard.

17:32.217 --> 17:33.469
You understand?

17:34.553 --> 17:37.973
Now, I will never ask you to do something
that you don't wanna do.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.683
But this is important to me.

17:41.810 --> 17:42.644
Okay.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.229
I'll work it out.

17:45.314 --> 17:46.315
I know you will.

17:53.489 --> 17:54.364
[Soledad] The little one.

17:54.448 --> 17:57.034
[speaking in Spanish]

17:57.117 --> 17:59.036
-[laughs]
-[Sally] That's Kevin's boy.

17:59.119 --> 18:00.829
He's named after my husband.

18:01.163 --> 18:03.082
-But we call him Rocky.
-[chuckles]

18:03.165 --> 18:05.000
I love being a grandparent.

18:05.834 --> 18:08.754
It's like eating all the ice cream
you want and never getting fat.

18:08.837 --> 18:10.089
[both laugh]

18:11.048 --> 18:12.216
Thank you.

18:16.386 --> 18:17.805
Did John tell you about today?

18:22.601 --> 18:26.021
[coos, exclaims in Spanish]

18:26.772 --> 18:29.733
[Kevin] Maybe your friend should
take it easy on the cerveza, yeah?

18:29.817 --> 18:31.318
Ah, he will be fine.

18:32.236 --> 18:34.571
If he gets sick,
I just push him over the side, huh?

18:34.655 --> 18:37.407
[speaking in Spanish]

18:38.408 --> 18:40.285
This was a favorite spot
of Hemingway.

18:40.994 --> 18:42.871
-Yeah?
-You know him? Hemingway?

18:42.955 --> 18:44.540
-Hemingway?
-[Esteban chuckles]

18:44.623 --> 18:46.667
My grandfather used to get drunk with him.

18:46.750 --> 18:49.002
Yeah, half of Havana used
to get drunk with Hemingway.

18:49.086 --> 18:50.796
Half of Havana got drunk
with my grandfather.

18:50.879 --> 18:52.172
Yeah, and slept with your mother.

18:52.256 --> 18:53.799
[speaking in Spanish]

18:54.216 --> 18:57.719
Well, that's part of our heritage
down here. Deep sea fishing, you know?

18:57.803 --> 19:00.681
We learn it from our dads
and they learn it from their dads.

19:01.265 --> 19:03.600
Heritage.
What's the word for that in Spanish?

19:03.684 --> 19:06.019
[both speaking in Spanish]

19:08.689 --> 19:12.192
My dad taught my brothers and I
how to fish when we were real little.

19:12.609 --> 19:14.403
And he used to say
what he loved best about it

19:14.486 --> 19:16.321
was that every time he came out...

19:17.030 --> 19:18.740
it was all about the struggle, right?

19:19.408 --> 19:22.077
You had to stay honest.
He would never use the boat...

19:23.078 --> 19:25.038
to tire out a fish
'cause that wasn't fair.

19:25.122 --> 19:27.166
-Has to be a fair fight.
-[speaks in Spanish]

19:27.249 --> 19:28.876
That's what I'm gonna teach my son.

19:30.127 --> 19:31.086
That's gonna be his...

19:32.504 --> 19:33.672
patrimonio.

19:34.256 --> 19:35.549
-[speaks in Spanish]
-Excuse me.

19:38.886 --> 19:40.929
Hey. To your son.

19:41.805 --> 19:43.390
Huh? [speaking in Spanish]

19:43.473 --> 19:44.808
What's his name?

19:44.892 --> 19:46.185
-Rocky.
-Para Rocky.

19:46.268 --> 19:47.144
Para Rocky!

19:47.227 --> 19:48.604
[laughs]

19:49.605 --> 19:50.689
[Kevin] Rocky.

19:54.818 --> 19:58.155
He said you were
against Eric O'Bannon's plea.

20:01.950 --> 20:02.868
[exhales]

20:02.951 --> 20:04.411
Raul is very angry.

20:05.287 --> 20:07.372
And he believes an eye for an eye.

20:07.956 --> 20:08.999
What about you?

20:11.001 --> 20:11.835
Oh, I...

20:12.586 --> 20:14.087
I try to find...

20:15.547 --> 20:18.383
forgiveness in my heart.

20:21.386 --> 20:23.931
But it feels like sand through my fingers.

20:31.438 --> 20:33.649
Have you been able to forgive the man...

20:34.149 --> 20:35.108
who killed Danny?

20:41.573 --> 20:43.700
[all whooping and yelling in Spanish]

20:48.413 --> 20:50.415
-Oh, my God.
-Give and take.

20:50.499 --> 20:52.709
Nicholas, Nicholas, give and take.
That's right.

20:52.793 --> 20:55.921
-You can't muscle him in.
-Use the engine, man. Use the engine.

20:56.004 --> 20:58.006
-We don't have to use the engine.
-Use the engine.

20:58.090 --> 21:00.884
-Let him have a run.
-[speaks in Spanish]

21:04.471 --> 21:05.514
[whooping continues]

21:06.640 --> 21:09.184
Now reel him, reel, reel him in!

21:09.268 --> 21:11.186
Reel. Come on. Come on, reel.

21:11.770 --> 21:13.897
Oh, shit. You got the mother lode there.

21:13.981 --> 21:16.608
-Now, that's a big fucking fish.
-Whoo!

21:16.692 --> 21:18.318
Hey, Nicholas, you're doing great.

21:18.402 --> 21:20.946
When the rod starts to bend like that,
feed him more line, okay?

21:21.029 --> 21:22.572
I'm coming. Give me a minute.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.158
[gunshots]

21:26.785 --> 21:28.203
What the fuck are you doing?!

21:28.287 --> 21:29.746
He was losing the fish, man.

21:29.830 --> 21:31.748
You can't shoot a fucking marlin.

21:32.207 --> 21:34.501
This is catch and release here,
you fucking idiots.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.421
Goddamn it.

21:38.714 --> 21:40.048
Fuck, man. Fuck you, motherfucker.

21:40.132 --> 21:42.092
-Hey, hey. Don't fucking touch me.
-Fuck you.

21:42.175 --> 21:44.636
-Tranquilo, Mateo. Tranquilo, Mateo.
-Fuck you, motherfucker.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.221
Don't you touch me. Fuck you.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.515
I've had it with this maniac.
I don't know what he's on,

21:48.598 --> 21:50.767
-I'm over this motherfucker.
-Kevin, we're sorry, man.

21:50.851 --> 21:53.353
We didn't know the rules.
We meant no offense, man.

21:53.937 --> 21:54.771
Fuck.

21:55.689 --> 21:57.983
-We can make this right.
-No, I don't want your money.

21:59.109 --> 22:00.319
Fuck you.

22:00.402 --> 22:02.779
[speaking in Spanish]

22:09.369 --> 22:11.997
My concern is not
about forgiveness, Soledad.

22:13.040 --> 22:15.000
Or about what happens to Eric O'Bannon.

22:15.876 --> 22:17.252
That's not what I care about.

22:19.421 --> 22:22.966
My son Danny, you know,
got involved in drugs and was murdered.

22:25.594 --> 22:26.762
It's still painful.

22:27.971 --> 22:28.930
For all of us.

22:31.266 --> 22:32.642
I don't wanna relive it.

22:34.269 --> 22:35.353
Not in public.

22:38.732 --> 22:40.734
The same is true for you.

22:45.072 --> 22:47.407
They could make him look like
a criminal if they want.

22:50.202 --> 22:51.703
If this goes to trial...

22:53.330 --> 22:55.082
we'll be put under a microscope.

22:59.961 --> 23:01.755
Every fight, every...

23:03.215 --> 23:04.382
mistake.

23:06.968 --> 23:07.969
Every loss.

23:11.681 --> 23:13.016
That's what I care about.

23:22.359 --> 23:24.361
[pop music playing over stereo]

23:32.327 --> 23:33.537
[neighs]

23:35.205 --> 23:36.581
[Charlotte] Does he work here?

23:37.165 --> 23:37.999
I guess.

23:42.003 --> 23:43.130
You want me to wait?

23:44.131 --> 23:44.965
No.

23:46.424 --> 23:48.218
You can call me if he doesn't show up.

23:48.468 --> 23:49.302
I'll come back.

24:02.023 --> 24:03.400
[cell phone jingling]

24:13.952 --> 24:14.870
She's not answering.

24:14.953 --> 24:17.706
She knew about today.
I'm sure she's just running late.

24:18.290 --> 24:19.291
That's okay.

24:19.374 --> 24:21.126
[John exhales]

24:23.795 --> 24:27.215
Well, let's use the time to talk about
what's happening with you two.

24:33.889 --> 24:37.142
-I thought we were gonna talk about Janey.
-This is about Janey.

24:38.810 --> 24:41.396
So, how long have you guys been separated?

24:42.939 --> 24:43.857
Tsk.

24:45.442 --> 24:46.401
Uh...

24:47.402 --> 24:48.987
-A couple of months.
-A few months.

24:52.449 --> 24:53.491
[Lilyan] What happened?

25:00.832 --> 25:03.627
-You don't want to talk about it?
-No, not necessarily.

25:06.004 --> 25:09.549
John has a hard time talking about
what he feels, his whole family does.

25:11.301 --> 25:12.886
Does Diana have a point, John?

25:13.970 --> 25:16.348
-Always.
-Really?

25:17.891 --> 25:20.894
Belle had to practically drag Kevin
to couples counseling.

25:20.977 --> 25:23.855
And then what? He lasted two times
before he stormed out.

25:24.814 --> 25:27.484
You guys don't--
You don't talk about this stuff.

25:29.444 --> 25:30.528
[sighs]

25:32.030 --> 25:34.115
-Okay.
-[Diana exhales]

25:35.575 --> 25:37.494
[Lilyan] Well, let me ask
a sensitive question.

25:38.536 --> 25:40.288
Are you seeing other people?

25:41.957 --> 25:43.583
Why is that relevant?

25:43.917 --> 25:46.169
Well, it could affect
Janey's state of mind.

25:51.383 --> 25:54.094
This is supposed to be a safe space.

25:57.138 --> 25:58.139
John?

26:00.517 --> 26:02.143
No, of course not.

26:07.315 --> 26:08.316
[Lilyan] Diana?

26:13.029 --> 26:14.155
Um...

26:18.493 --> 26:19.953
Yeah, I went on a date.

26:23.331 --> 26:24.332
[Lilyan] Okay.

26:27.252 --> 26:28.878
And what was that like?

26:30.922 --> 26:32.424
It was really strange.

26:34.342 --> 26:37.762
It was like an out-of-body experience.

26:42.767 --> 26:45.395
I haven't been out with someone else
since I was 16.

26:47.897 --> 26:51.192
It sounds like
you're making an effort to move on.

26:51.568 --> 26:53.320
Is that what you're telling John?

26:56.865 --> 26:58.033
I don't know.

27:03.079 --> 27:06.624
Diana said that you had trouble
expressing your feelings, John.

27:08.126 --> 27:10.045
I'm sure you feel something about this.

27:17.552 --> 27:18.470
No.

27:22.974 --> 27:24.017
I don't.

27:28.605 --> 27:30.774
[siren chirping]

27:32.275 --> 27:34.277
[♪♪♪]

28:16.277 --> 28:19.072
-Hi, I wasn't speeding.
-You okay, Ms. O'Bannon?

28:20.657 --> 28:22.200
How do you know who I am?

28:22.659 --> 28:25.370
Your brother's case has been
getting a lot of attention.

28:25.995 --> 28:29.290
I'm sure there's been a lot of stress.
You haven't been drinking or doing drugs?

28:29.374 --> 28:31.042
-No. No.
-Good.

28:32.210 --> 28:33.920
Can you step out of the car, please?

28:35.088 --> 28:37.215
-Why?
-Because I asked you nicely.

28:43.722 --> 28:45.014
I'm so sorry I'm late.

28:45.098 --> 28:46.599
-Did you get my text?
-Uh-huh.

28:46.683 --> 28:49.477
I had to take these people fishing.
I'm so sorry. Who's here?

28:49.728 --> 28:50.729
Uh, no one.

28:51.980 --> 28:54.190
-There's a truck in the driveway.
-I know.

28:56.568 --> 28:58.069
-What's going on?
-It's a gift.

28:58.945 --> 29:02.949
-What are you talking about?
-It's a gift. More of an acknowledgment.

29:03.032 --> 29:05.118
It's from Roy.

29:05.910 --> 29:07.120
Are you shitting me?

29:09.122 --> 29:11.833
-That's from--? Are you shitting me?
-It's for you!

29:12.250 --> 29:15.003
He wanted me to tell you
that he appreciates your work.

29:15.795 --> 29:19.007
-And so do I, but I really gotta go.
-Oh, my gosh.

29:19.090 --> 29:21.634
Listen, there's, uh, two bottles
in the refrigerator.

29:21.718 --> 29:24.429
He had a late nap, so just,
you know, wait an hour or so.

29:25.054 --> 29:27.557
-I'm good.
-Wow, Daddy got a new truck.

29:27.932 --> 29:29.976
Here you go. You two behave, okay?

29:30.059 --> 29:32.520
Heck, no. We're gonna get
into all kinds of trouble.

29:32.604 --> 29:34.773
We're gonna go joyriding
in Daddy's new truck.

29:36.149 --> 29:38.067
-Go. Have fun. Have a margarita for me.
-[laughs]

29:38.943 --> 29:41.780
Dinner with adults.
I hope I remember how to use a fork.

29:41.863 --> 29:42.947
[Kevin chuckles]

29:43.031 --> 29:46.993
You know, try to read him a book instead
of falling asleep in front of the TV.

29:47.076 --> 29:48.578
-Bye. Mwah.
-I love you. Bye.

29:49.287 --> 29:50.371
[door closes]

29:51.080 --> 29:54.209
-Spread your legs. Hands on the car.
-I know what you're doing.

29:54.959 --> 29:59.297
I'm just doing my job, ma'am.
Now, please, turn around. Face the car.

30:06.721 --> 30:08.515
I'm gonna need your name
and badge number.

30:08.598 --> 30:09.891
Of course, ma'am.

30:13.770 --> 30:16.648
You're clean.
You can get back in your car now.

30:24.781 --> 30:27.450
The whole department's concerned
about your safety, Ms. O'Bannon.

30:28.535 --> 30:31.371
A lot of people are upset about
what happened to Detective Diaz.

30:32.121 --> 30:33.414
You have a good night, okay?

30:45.593 --> 30:46.845
[line ringing]

30:49.514 --> 30:51.307
-[Kevin] Hey, Roy.
-You get my thank-you?

30:51.391 --> 30:53.810
Yes, I did. I tried to call you earlier.

30:53.893 --> 30:56.479
I don't know what to say. It's beautiful.

30:56.563 --> 30:59.858
Six-point-two liter engine.
Should pull any boat you want.

31:00.859 --> 31:01.860
That's amazing.

31:03.027 --> 31:03.862
Thank you.

31:04.279 --> 31:06.364
But you really didn't have to do that.

31:06.447 --> 31:09.909
You probably know by now, Kevin,
I don't do much I don't want to do.

31:11.035 --> 31:13.788
I heard you had some excitement
out on the water today.

31:13.872 --> 31:14.747
Uh, yeah.

31:14.831 --> 31:16.207
You could say that.

31:16.291 --> 31:19.460
The boys want to make it up to you
tonight. Take you out on the town.

31:19.544 --> 31:23.548
No, that's really not necessary.
I've got the baby tonight.

31:24.382 --> 31:28.219
Ah, that's too bad.
I don't want there to be any ill will.

31:28.678 --> 31:30.763
[speaking in Spanish]

31:30.847 --> 31:32.056
Got an idea.

31:32.807 --> 31:36.185
Why don't you let
your mom take Rocky for the night?

31:36.269 --> 31:37.395
Bet she'd love that.

31:38.271 --> 31:39.355
Um...

31:41.399 --> 31:43.067
Yeah, yeah, that's a great idea.

31:43.151 --> 31:45.778
Let me, uh... Let me call her.

31:45.862 --> 31:46.863
Excellent.

31:48.448 --> 31:49.616
Enjoy your new ride.

31:49.699 --> 31:51.701
[speaking in Spanish]

31:53.286 --> 31:55.455
[man] Oklahoma.
It's shaped like a pot with a handle.

31:55.538 --> 31:58.374
A hot pot. You can't just hold the handle.
You need a potholder.

31:58.458 --> 32:01.085
Arkansas looks like a potholder.
I was born in Colorado--

32:01.169 --> 32:02.879
[Eric] Shut the fuck up.

32:02.962 --> 32:04.631
[man] Can't tell it from Wyoming on a map.

32:04.714 --> 32:07.508
Florida's like a big dick swinging off
the bottom of the US of A.

32:07.592 --> 32:09.886
-[guard] O'Bannon. You got a visitor.
-Who is it?

32:09.969 --> 32:13.348
-[man] Georgia's shaped like my...
-Fuck do I know? Hands on the gate.

32:13.431 --> 32:16.726
[man] South Carolina's shaped
like the sweet patootie

32:16.809 --> 32:18.728
of the first girl that ever showed me one.

32:19.187 --> 32:20.605
[handcuffs clicking]

32:36.162 --> 32:37.956
[Kevin] Okay, buddy, here we go.

32:38.665 --> 32:40.041
Good boy.

32:41.417 --> 32:42.710
Here we go.

32:43.461 --> 32:44.420
Yeah.

32:45.004 --> 32:46.631
We're gonna go see Grandma.

32:47.882 --> 32:50.009
-Mom, you in there?
-[Sally] Yeah, honey.

32:50.093 --> 32:53.596
Somebody wants to see you.
He's falling asleep.

32:54.263 --> 32:55.848
-Look at him.
-[Sally] Oh!

32:55.932 --> 32:58.476
Hi, Grandma. Hey, buddy.
I didn't know you were here.

32:58.559 --> 32:59.936
[Kevin sighs]

33:00.019 --> 33:02.188
Thank you so much for doing this.

33:02.271 --> 33:05.566
[Sally] Any excuse to see
my little guy. Hi.

33:05.650 --> 33:08.653
I have everything in here
that you're gonna need. Uh--

33:08.736 --> 33:12.615
-There's diapers, wipes, these two--
-Kevin, I had five children.

33:12.699 --> 33:15.201
-Okay.
-They were all babies once upon a time.

33:15.284 --> 33:17.328
Use Purell on your hands.
Be careful, please.

33:17.412 --> 33:19.956
Mom has something
that she wants to tell you, Kev.

33:20.039 --> 33:23.167
-Um, I can't really talk.
-You'll want to hear what she has to say.

33:24.752 --> 33:25.586
Okay.

33:27.672 --> 33:28.840
What?

33:32.385 --> 33:33.386
What?

33:34.929 --> 33:39.434
I spoke with Soledad Diaz today.
They're gonna accept the plea.

33:41.227 --> 33:42.395
They are?

33:44.230 --> 33:45.231
Really?

33:46.399 --> 33:47.900
[laughs]

33:47.984 --> 33:48.985
Really?

33:49.986 --> 33:51.362
[Kevin exhales]

33:51.446 --> 33:54.073
So, it's over? Thank you.

33:54.657 --> 33:57.368
-Thank you so much. Thank you so much!
-Oh!

33:57.452 --> 34:01.122
-Oh, Kevin. Please. Put me down.
-I love you, I love you, I love you.

34:01.205 --> 34:05.918
-What did you say to her?
-I told her the truth. Some of it.

34:06.419 --> 34:09.922
Did you hear that, Rock?
Did you hear this?

34:10.590 --> 34:12.383
We got such good news.

34:15.011 --> 34:16.846
Maybe Meg will come home now.

34:18.097 --> 34:19.223
[Kevin] Daddy loves you.

34:20.183 --> 34:21.642
Yes, who's the bestest boy?

34:23.561 --> 34:24.479
That's right.

34:29.650 --> 34:31.736
-[John] Hey, Kevin.
-I really gotta go, man.

34:37.492 --> 34:39.535
-When did you get this?
-Today.

34:41.454 --> 34:44.665
-You drove down to Key West to get this?
-No, it was a gift.

34:44.749 --> 34:46.542
-Really?
-Yeah.

34:46.918 --> 34:47.919
Really.

34:50.588 --> 34:53.091
John, I don't have to explain
my business to you.

34:56.135 --> 34:57.428
No, you're right. You don't.

34:58.513 --> 35:00.598
-[groans]
-Hey, Kevin.

35:02.391 --> 35:04.310
The court hasn't approved the plea.

35:05.144 --> 35:07.188
I wouldn't be discussing it with anyone.

35:07.271 --> 35:09.482
Okay, John. Thank you.

35:09.565 --> 35:12.026
But I already know that.
I'm not a fucking idiot.

35:14.362 --> 35:15.822
[engine starts]

35:40.138 --> 35:41.139
[sniffs]

35:45.184 --> 35:48.437
I tried to get some Little Debbies
through. Swiss rolls.

35:49.480 --> 35:50.690
They confiscated them.

35:57.196 --> 35:59.740
Santos came by to see me.
She said you were gonna plead out.

36:11.043 --> 36:14.797
When we lived on Oceanside,
we shared a room. Remember?

36:21.679 --> 36:23.848
Mom and Dad used to fight so bad.

36:25.016 --> 36:27.727
They'd go from room to room
throwing shit at each other.

36:28.603 --> 36:30.271
Remember that pirate ashtray?

36:32.148 --> 36:34.400
When Mom chucked it
through the sliding glass door?

36:34.859 --> 36:36.569
She had a good fucking arm.

36:38.905 --> 36:41.240
You used to tell me a story
to drown out the noise.

36:42.116 --> 36:46.204
Same story every time.
Some Woody Woodpecker cartoon.

36:46.287 --> 36:48.247
Where Buzz Buzzard was getting chased

36:48.331 --> 36:51.375
by the circular saw
at the lumber yard. Yep.

36:51.792 --> 36:53.419
You'd tell it the same way every time.

36:53.502 --> 36:54.337
[chuckles]

36:55.338 --> 36:58.216
One day Woody Woodpecker was up
in his tree and heard a sound.

36:58.299 --> 37:00.801
He heard a loud, piercing sound.

37:03.346 --> 37:05.681
And he flew down
to where it was coming from

37:05.765 --> 37:08.893
and he peeked through a hole in the wall.

37:11.938 --> 37:13.314
The same story every time.

37:14.732 --> 37:16.734
[♪♪♪]

37:17.777 --> 37:19.028
Same ending.

37:20.363 --> 37:22.740
Woody flew home to his nest.

37:24.450 --> 37:27.370
And he pulled the blankets
up over his head.

37:29.789 --> 37:31.082
Good night, Woody.

37:39.006 --> 37:41.217
You must have told me
that story 500 times.

37:43.261 --> 37:44.929
I'm not good at making up shit.

37:46.430 --> 37:47.265
[sniffs]

37:50.351 --> 37:51.352
I know.

37:54.814 --> 37:56.107
I remembered that today.

38:01.529 --> 38:03.489
If your story is true, you should tell it.

38:12.039 --> 38:12.873
[sniffs]

38:21.173 --> 38:23.009

38:23.092 --> 38:25.428
Oh, my God. Um...

38:26.387 --> 38:27.763
-Sheryl, right?
-Sheryl.

38:27.847 --> 38:29.390
-Yeah.
-Kevin.

38:29.473 --> 38:32.018
-Kevin.
-So, where you been, stranger?

38:32.101 --> 38:34.478
You know,
just staying out of trouble, trying.

38:34.562 --> 38:37.273
Uh, I got back together with my wife,

38:37.356 --> 38:40.651
and, uh, we actually just had a baby,
a little boy.

38:40.735 --> 38:42.695
-Congratulations.
-Thank you very much.

38:42.778 --> 38:44.488
-Happily married, huh?
-Yes, I am.

38:44.572 --> 38:48.826
-You just described everyone in here.
-Yeah, right. I know what you mean.

38:48.909 --> 38:50.036
[laughs]

38:50.119 --> 38:51.495
So, what are we drinking?

38:51.579 --> 38:55.374
Uh, can I get a bottle of Patrón please
for those three idiots over there?

38:55.458 --> 38:58.002
And, uh, just a Coke for me.

38:58.085 --> 39:02.214
-Wow, you did clean your act up.
-I'm trying, Sheryl. I'm trying.

39:02.298 --> 39:04.050
[Sheryl] I'll get that Patrón.

39:04.133 --> 39:05.801
-Good to see you.
-You, too.

39:20.608 --> 39:21.942

39:49.887 --> 39:53.265
You must come to Cuba, Kevin,
before it completely changes.

39:53.974 --> 39:56.936
-You like to eat, papi?
-Of course. Who doesn't like to eat?

39:57.353 --> 39:59.438
I take you to the best paladares.

39:59.522 --> 40:03.192
You will try the ropa vieja.
Like nothing else, right, Nicholas?

40:03.275 --> 40:04.110
[laughs]

40:04.193 --> 40:06.779
Hey, Kevin.
You're still not mad about the fish thing?

40:06.862 --> 40:09.698
-Forget it. You didn't know.
-It's time to celebrate.

40:10.282 --> 40:12.785
[sniffs, whoops]

40:12.868 --> 40:14.453
What the fuck? No, no, no, man.

40:14.537 --> 40:17.581
Listen, dude. Fuck that. Hey, hey, listen.

40:17.665 --> 40:20.209
-I don't understand.
-I'm on probation, okay?

40:20.709 --> 40:22.878
If I get even seen with this shit,
I go to jail.

40:22.962 --> 40:24.463
I'm not gonna go to jail for you.

40:24.547 --> 40:26.590
Kevin, it's worth it, man. It's pure.

Hello.

42:04.271 --> 42:07.107
[Janey] Daddy? What are you doing home?

42:08.275 --> 42:10.653
I was just stopping by.
Where were you today?

42:10.736 --> 42:13.447
I'm sorry. I... I should've called.

42:14.406 --> 42:16.116
I was just upset about some things.

42:20.871 --> 42:22.122
Listen, I know it's hard.

It's gonna get better, kiddo.

You gotta help me out here, Rock.
I'm trying to stay cool.

-[Kevin] What the fuck happened?
-[Esteban] It was a disagreement.

This piece of shit stabbed him.

What the fuck did you do?!
You okay, man?

He was trying to get him
to stop touching me.

Whatever that costs,
we're gonna take care of it, okay?

Oh, yeah.

46:44.676 --> 46:47.679
Your brother, Kevin,
was with those Cuban guys.

46:47.763 --> 46:49.389
I didn't say anything to anybody

to get him in any trouble.

Probably halfway to Cuba by now.

You got a victim over here,

Call me now.

48:18.270 --> 48:19.313
[Kevin] Not funny, man.

48:27.404 --> 48:30.574
John, come on, man. Look, I can explain.

48:35.996 --> 48:39.791
Don't you dare. Don't you--
John, come on, man. I gotta get home.

48:41.585 --> 48:43.629
What happened tonight
was not my fault. All right?

48:43.712 --> 48:45.547
It's never your fault, is it, Kevin?

48:45.839 --> 48:48.884
-Such an asshole.
-Hand me the line.

49:02.272 --> 49:03.857
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

49:03.940 --> 49:06.026
Fuck. Goddamn it!

49:07.861 --> 49:09.363
What, are you fucking ten?!

49:10.989 --> 49:12.741
You feel like a big man now, huh, John?

49:12.824 --> 49:15.077
You better watch it.
I'm not who you think I am.

49:17.371 --> 49:20.290
I forgot to tell you that Eric O'Bannon,
he changed his mind.

49:20.374 --> 49:22.501
He dropped the plea deal.
The case is gonna go to trial.

49:22.584 --> 49:25.003
He changed his mind?
You said you were gonna fix it.

49:25.087 --> 49:27.381
Well, now there's the Kevin that I know.

49:28.465 --> 49:31.301
You are exactly who I think you are.

[grunting]

49:52.531 --> 49:54.741
You're getting fucking old, John.
You hear me?

49:54.825 --> 49:58.328
You have lost your family.
You have lost fucking everything.

49:58.412 --> 50:00.414
Get the fuck off of me.

50:04.167 --> 50:06.837
Stop it. Stop it right now!
