00:00.174 --> 00:02.841
(ominous music)

01:17.550 --> 01:20.063
- Come on, girl, or you're
gon' be late for school.

01:35.127 --> 01:36.006
It took long enough.

01:36.007 --> 01:37.923
You can't keep being late for school.

01:41.370 --> 01:43.699
Love you too.
- Love you too.

01:43.700 --> 01:45.553
- And put that jacket on.
- Okay, mom!

01:48.496 --> 01:50.996
(phone rings)

01:52.770 --> 01:54.069
- Hello?

01:54.070 --> 01:55.149
- Hey, girl.

01:55.150 --> 01:56.899
What you up to?

01:56.900 --> 01:58.449
- Hey, girl.

01:58.450 --> 02:00.109
About to get dressed
and go to this meeting

02:00.110 --> 02:02.028
with this psychic chick.

02:02.029 --> 02:04.309
- I know you're not talking
about one of those psychics

02:04.310 --> 02:06.819
that be all on the commercials and stuff.

02:06.820 --> 02:09.283
You do know that shit
is some bullshit, right?

02:10.440 --> 02:13.109
- Look, my life is all
over the place right now.

02:13.110 --> 02:16.629
I just need to know, you know,
what steps I need to take.

02:16.630 --> 02:17.463
- What?

02:18.350 --> 02:19.182
That's on you.

02:19.183 --> 02:21.559
All that psychic stuff is a scam,

02:21.560 --> 02:24.529
but if you wanna throw your
money away, go right ahead.

02:24.530 --> 02:25.823
That's on you.

02:26.936 --> 02:29.059
(laughs)

02:29.060 --> 02:29.959
- You are crazy.

02:29.960 --> 02:32.009
Look, I'll hit you up when it's done

02:32.010 --> 02:33.843
and let you know how it went, okay?

02:34.927 --> 02:35.759
(laughs)

02:35.760 --> 02:36.593
All right, bye.

02:38.189 --> 02:40.606
(calm music)

03:13.300 --> 03:18.300
Thank you.

03:20.108 --> 03:21.108
- Thank you.

03:23.907 --> 03:25.403
- So, how does this work?

03:27.830 --> 03:29.549
- You look lovely today.

03:29.550 --> 03:30.559
- Thank you.

03:30.560 --> 03:33.649
- So, sweetheart, what's your name?

03:33.650 --> 03:34.829
- Ain't you the psychic?

03:34.830 --> 03:37.030
Shouldn't you be telling
me what my name is?

03:38.130 --> 03:40.380
(chuckles)

04:00.660 --> 04:01.493
- Hm.

04:10.410 --> 04:11.710
I see you have a daughter.

04:23.520 --> 04:26.313
So, you just got out of a
toxic relationship, huh?

04:27.186 --> 04:29.233
- Girl, toxic wasn't the word.

04:39.780 --> 04:43.189
- So your mother's very sick
and she's in the hospital.

04:43.190 --> 04:44.533
She's battling cancer.

04:46.090 --> 04:49.539
Rest assured, she'll be just fine.

04:49.540 --> 04:50.963
She's gonna pull through.

05:02.150 --> 05:02.983
I'm sorry.

05:03.942 --> 05:06.353
I'm sorry, I can't continue this reading.

05:06.354 --> 05:07.186
- What?

05:07.187 --> 05:08.019
- I just can't continue this reading.

05:08.020 --> 05:10.059
- What's wrong?
- I can't, you have to leave.

05:10.060 --> 05:11.609
You have to go.
- What?

05:11.610 --> 05:13.939
What did you see?
- You have to leave, please.

05:13.940 --> 05:14.952
Thank you.

05:14.953 --> 05:15.785
- You have to go.
- What?

05:15.786 --> 05:16.618
- I'm sorry, you have to-
- What?

05:16.619 --> 05:18.958
Wait, what's wrong?
- I'm sorry, I can't continue.

05:18.959 --> 05:19.791
- What did you see?

05:19.792 --> 05:20.969
Like-
- You have to go.

05:20.970 --> 05:22.109
Please, you have to go.

05:22.110 --> 05:23.209
I can't.

05:23.210 --> 05:24.110
- Are you serious?

05:26.440 --> 05:27.333
Thanks.

05:38.064 --> 05:40.389
- So, how did it go?

05:40.390 --> 05:42.609
- Girl, it was weird.

05:42.610 --> 05:44.349
At first, it started off good,

05:44.350 --> 05:46.704
and then it's like it just went left.

05:46.705 --> 05:48.955
- What you mean, went left?

05:50.340 --> 05:52.433
- Girl, she started the reading.

05:53.320 --> 05:56.519
She saw the cards like
then she just stopped

05:56.520 --> 05:57.969
and gave my money back.

05:57.970 --> 06:00.209
It's like she saw something
and it spooked her,

06:00.210 --> 06:01.732
I don't know.

06:01.733 --> 06:02.579
- Girl, I keep telling you,

06:02.580 --> 06:05.959
all that psychic shit
is a bunch of bullshit.

06:05.960 --> 06:08.469
Just be glad you got your money back.

06:08.470 --> 06:11.379
Won't you meet me over my crib
so we can have a few drinks.

06:11.380 --> 06:12.913
You know I like to get lit.

06:13.990 --> 06:17.477
- Nah, girl, this shit ain't
really sitting well with me.

06:17.478 --> 06:20.395
I'ma just hit you later, all right?

06:29.948 --> 06:31.316
Hey, baby, how was your day?

06:31.317 --> 06:33.129
- It was okay.

06:33.130 --> 06:35.649
Is it okay if I hang out
with my friend later?

06:35.650 --> 06:37.156
- What friend?

06:37.157 --> 06:39.379
- My friend James.

06:39.380 --> 06:40.809
- James?

06:40.810 --> 06:41.649
Didn't I tell you

06:41.650 --> 06:44.003
I don't want you hanging
out with that boy?

06:44.004 --> 06:45.490
I don't trust him.

06:45.491 --> 06:47.079
- Ma, James is a good guy.

06:47.080 --> 06:48.673
He treats me nice.

06:51.220 --> 06:53.353
- Do you trust him?
- Yes!

06:55.360 --> 06:56.949
- All right.

06:56.950 --> 06:59.859
You can hang out with him, but
make sure you bring your butt

06:59.860 --> 07:01.520
back in this house by 10 p.m.

07:01.521 --> 07:02.353
- Oh, yes!

07:02.354 --> 07:03.196
Thank you, ma!

07:03.197 --> 07:05.427
- And be careful.
- Yes, ma'am.

07:09.103 --> 07:09.936
- Lord.

07:23.100 --> 07:23.933
- I'm sorry.

07:24.981 --> 07:27.031
I'm sorry, I can't continue this reading.

07:50.370 --> 07:51.473
How may I help you?

07:53.044 --> 07:55.109
- Look, I'll pay you double.

07:55.110 --> 07:56.839
Can you just tell me my reading?

07:56.840 --> 08:00.173
- Ma'am, I think it's
best that you just leave.

08:01.270 --> 08:02.469
- Like, is it that bad?

08:02.470 --> 08:04.729
Why won't you just tell me what you saw?

08:04.730 --> 08:06.199
- Why did you come here?

08:06.200 --> 08:08.143
Listen, I'm trying to help you.

08:10.620 --> 08:12.070
- Look, I'll give you triple.

08:16.450 --> 08:17.900
- Why did you come back here?

08:20.477 --> 08:22.477
(sighs)

08:29.258 --> 08:30.508
Just stay away.

08:49.380 --> 08:51.953
I see your daughter's falling
in love with a young man.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.113
- Can you tell me more about him?

09:03.320 --> 09:08.320
- Well, he's a good guy and
he truly loves your daughter.

09:11.730 --> 09:13.680
She's safe with him for the time being.

09:15.620 --> 09:17.570
- What do you mean, for the time being?

09:36.192 --> 09:38.847
- He's going to die a horrible death.

09:38.848 --> 09:39.680
- [Hazel] What?

09:39.681 --> 09:41.833
- And it's going to crush your daughter.

09:43.020 --> 09:44.729
- Are you serious?

09:44.730 --> 09:45.563
- I'm afraid so.

09:47.137 --> 09:48.137
- Oh my God.

10:02.146 --> 10:02.978
What?

10:02.979 --> 10:03.896
What is it?

10:07.653 --> 10:12.173
- You're gonna meet a
man, a very handsome man.

10:13.220 --> 10:16.009
He's gonna be all that you...

10:16.010 --> 10:16.880
He's gonna...

10:18.070 --> 10:21.429
He's gonna have the look,
he's gonna walk the walk

10:21.430 --> 10:22.909
and he's gonna talk how you want,

10:22.910 --> 10:25.763
he's gonna be all that you want in a man.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.853
Stay away from him!

10:30.800 --> 10:32.459
- Wait, hold up.

10:32.460 --> 10:33.526
So you mean to tell me,

10:33.527 --> 10:36.509
I'm going to meet the man of my dreams

10:36.510 --> 10:38.467
but you want me to stay away from him?

10:39.530 --> 10:43.937
- Listen, I want you
to stay away from him.

10:45.140 --> 10:48.859
If you see this man, you are
to run as far as you can run

10:48.860 --> 10:49.692
and get away from him!

10:49.693 --> 10:50.699
He is no good for you!

10:50.700 --> 10:51.719
Do you understand?

10:51.720 --> 10:52.649
You hear me?

10:52.650 --> 10:54.260
He's no good for you!

10:56.620 --> 10:58.359
Stay away from him!

10:58.360 --> 11:00.979
- All right, look, I'm
done with this shit.

11:00.980 --> 11:02.530
- [Psychic] Stay away from him!

11:22.550 --> 11:25.599
- What's up, girl?
- Where you at?

11:25.600 --> 11:28.089
- Girl, just leaving that psychic's house.

11:28.090 --> 11:30.849
You were right, she was
acting real crazy today.

11:30.850 --> 11:33.313
- [GPS] In one mile, turn
right onto Barry Road.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.929
- [Tonya] Bitch already got your money,

11:35.930 --> 11:38.402
so now she just gon' tell you anything.

11:38.403 --> 11:41.163
- Man, I'm done with all this
fortune-telling bullshit.

11:42.690 --> 11:44.989
- [Tonya] Look, I'm
headed to work right now.

11:44.990 --> 11:47.814
So, I'ma come over tonight when I get off.

11:47.815 --> 11:49.665
- All right, I'ma see you later then.

11:53.346 --> 11:55.763
(calm music)

12:20.369 --> 12:21.702
'Scuse you!

12:21.703 --> 12:23.819
- I can't let a beautiful
lady like yourself

12:23.820 --> 12:25.083
pump her own gas.

12:28.820 --> 12:30.333
- Are you gonna pay for it too?

12:31.550 --> 12:32.903
- That goes without saying.

12:36.270 --> 12:37.999
What's a beautiful lady like yourself

12:38.000 --> 12:39.350
doing on this side of town?

12:41.380 --> 12:43.189
- I live on this side of town.

12:43.190 --> 12:45.549
What about yourself?

12:45.550 --> 12:47.439
- I'm actually here meeting a client.

12:47.440 --> 12:48.440
I'm glad that I did.

12:50.350 --> 12:51.399
- Oh, yeah?

12:51.400 --> 12:52.593
And why was that?

12:53.538 --> 12:55.869
- Because I got a chance to run into you.

12:55.870 --> 12:58.769
By the way, my name is Floyd.

12:58.770 --> 13:00.259
- Hazel.

13:00.260 --> 13:02.749
It was nice meeting you.

13:02.750 --> 13:03.582
- Hey, hold on.

13:03.583 --> 13:06.153
I can't just let you walk away
without getting your number.

13:07.390 --> 13:08.840
- I don't give my number out.

13:12.608 --> 13:15.423
- I'll tell you what, how
about I give you mine?

13:22.700 --> 13:25.029
I'm looking forward to your call.

13:25.030 --> 13:26.635
- We'll see.

13:26.636 --> 13:28.793
- I'ma run in and take
care of that gas for you.

13:36.256 --> 13:40.396
(indistinct chattering)

13:40.397 --> 13:42.147
- You wrong for that.

13:43.150 --> 13:44.677
- So, I met this guy today.

13:46.560 --> 13:49.249
- [Tonya] Okay, does he have money?

13:49.250 --> 13:52.519
- Girl, it looks like it.
- Is he fine?

13:52.520 --> 13:54.559
- Fine ain't even the word, girl.

13:54.560 --> 13:56.610
- So, what's the problem?

13:58.270 --> 14:01.003
- Look, I talked to
that psychic chick today

14:01.004 --> 14:03.499
and she told me I was gon' meet this man

14:03.500 --> 14:05.277
but I should stay away from him.

14:06.526 --> 14:09.009
- There you go with that psychic bullshit.

14:09.010 --> 14:12.543
You know, come on, fine ass man
pops out the clear blue sky.

14:13.760 --> 14:15.029
And he has money?

14:15.030 --> 14:17.619
Girl, if you don't take him, I will.

14:17.620 --> 14:19.739
- Girl, I know, it's just something,

14:19.740 --> 14:21.790
I'm just skeptical about the whole thing.

14:23.480 --> 14:25.229
- First of all, you
know where we come from,

14:25.230 --> 14:26.839
there's no good men.

14:26.840 --> 14:30.749
So, here it is, you have a
good man and he has money?

14:30.750 --> 14:33.349
You better get on that because
if you don't jump on that,

14:33.350 --> 14:35.250
somebody else will, best believe that.

14:36.140 --> 14:37.307
- That's true.

14:42.462 --> 14:44.879
(soft music)

15:01.526 --> 15:02.639
Hello?

15:02.640 --> 15:04.003
Can I speak to Floyd?

15:05.780 --> 15:07.380
- What took you so long to call?

15:09.600 --> 15:11.603
- Do you even know who this is?

15:13.390 --> 15:14.240
- Of course I do.

15:15.620 --> 15:17.273
I recognize that voice anywhere.

15:19.540 --> 15:21.093
- Aren't you a charmer?

15:25.270 --> 15:27.573
- Listen, I wanna take you out.

15:28.480 --> 15:30.099
- Why me?

15:30.100 --> 15:31.450
What's so special about me?

15:33.596 --> 15:34.743
- You're the chosen one.

15:36.670 --> 15:38.063
- The chosen one, huh?

15:40.010 --> 15:40.843
- Yeah.

15:42.244 --> 15:44.719
I wanna introduce you to some new things.

15:44.720 --> 15:46.820
Some things that you might not be used to,

15:48.303 --> 15:49.453
but only if you let me.

15:51.653 --> 15:54.864
- All right.

15:54.865 --> 15:55.948
See you soon.

15:58.044 --> 15:58.877
Bye.

16:22.090 --> 16:25.481
- Mama gon' kill me for
coming back so late.

16:25.482 --> 16:26.932
- I'm sorry but you know
I really love the time

16:26.933 --> 16:28.162
I can get with you.

16:28.163 --> 16:29.275
I love you.

16:29.276 --> 16:30.693
- I love you too.

16:32.714 --> 16:34.797
See you tomorrow.
- Right.

16:36.008 --> 16:38.591
(upbeat music)

16:55.328 --> 16:58.245
(knuckles rapping)

17:02.567 --> 17:04.860
- [Jennifer] Can I help you?

17:04.861 --> 17:06.556
- I'm here to pick up Hazel.

17:06.557 --> 17:07.807
- [Jennifer] And you are?

17:09.140 --> 17:10.089
- Floyd.

17:10.090 --> 17:11.902
- [Jennifer] Where you taking my mom?

17:11.903 --> 17:12.884
- Well, I'm actually taking her to-

17:12.885 --> 17:15.385
- Girl, why you being so nosy?

17:16.245 --> 17:17.716
You look handsome.

17:17.717 --> 17:20.365
- Thank you, thank you.

17:20.366 --> 17:21.949
You look beautiful.

17:21.950 --> 17:23.109
- Thanks, babe.

17:23.110 --> 17:24.087
All right, ready?

17:24.930 --> 17:26.916
Don't stay up all night.

17:26.917 --> 17:28.063
Call me if you need me, all right?

17:28.064 --> 17:29.564
- Yes, ma'am, mom.

17:41.090 --> 17:43.683
Yeah, my mom just left, you can come over.

17:46.090 --> 17:48.227
She went on some date, some guy.

17:50.750 --> 17:52.353
Yeah, and bring some drinks.

18:01.035 --> 18:04.243
- Get it right and keep going. (chuckles)

18:06.016 --> 18:08.202
- Dinner was amazing.

18:08.203 --> 18:10.504
- Yeah, I was hoping that you liked it.

18:10.505 --> 18:12.265
I've been going to that
restaurant for years.

18:13.582 --> 18:15.979
- Are you always like this?

18:15.980 --> 18:17.319
- Like what?

18:17.320 --> 18:19.399
- Nice and sweet?

18:19.400 --> 18:21.320
Or am I just getting this treatment

18:21.321 --> 18:24.821
because I'm one of your new little things?

18:26.087 --> 18:28.619
- Wow, one of my new things?

18:28.620 --> 18:30.599
My little things.

18:30.600 --> 18:31.579
Wow.

18:31.580 --> 18:36.303
First of all, I'm with
you, you're my only thing.

18:37.610 --> 18:40.553
Secondly, yes, always like this.

18:42.039 --> 18:44.348
- A girl can get used to this.

18:44.349 --> 18:45.948
- You should.

18:45.949 --> 18:48.261
- Hazel, what's up, baby?

18:48.262 --> 18:50.461
Got damn, look at this motherfucker.

18:50.462 --> 18:51.379
- Kareem!

18:51.380 --> 18:54.058
What do you want?
- I've been looking for you,

18:54.059 --> 18:55.143
I've been trying to holla at you.

18:55.144 --> 18:56.129
What's up?

18:56.130 --> 18:57.999
- Looking for me, why?

18:58.000 --> 18:59.229
- I need to talk to you.

18:59.230 --> 19:03.413
But I mean, I see you've
been busy and everything.

19:05.040 --> 19:05.873
- But what?

19:06.720 --> 19:08.026
What?

19:08.027 --> 19:09.847
- Look, I really need to just talk to you

19:09.848 --> 19:10.909
in private for a min...

19:10.910 --> 19:12.952
Man, who the fuck is this nigga?

19:12.953 --> 19:14.303
- This is my friend, Floyd.

19:16.080 --> 19:17.113
- Nice to meet you, brother.

19:17.114 --> 19:17.946
- Fuck outta here.

19:17.947 --> 19:21.569
Aye, look, man, done keep playing games

19:21.570 --> 19:24.577
with the church boy joker,
man, just give me a holla.

19:26.136 --> 19:27.053
- Bye, bye!

19:32.887 --> 19:34.293
I'm so sorry about that.

19:35.540 --> 19:40.540
- So, I take it that was your ex?

19:42.210 --> 19:43.043
- Unfortunately.

19:46.433 --> 19:47.766
Yeah, I'm sorry.

19:50.720 --> 19:52.337
- Yeah, so have you been thinking about

19:52.338 --> 19:53.655
what we talked about?

19:53.656 --> 19:54.823
- You talking 'bout the baby?

19:55.679 --> 19:58.319
- Yeah, I've been thinking
about telling my mom.

19:58.320 --> 20:00.857
- Yeah, I think we should
just go out and tell her.

20:01.970 --> 20:04.413
- Gotta wait for the perfect time.

20:04.414 --> 20:06.526
- I mean, your mom cool.

20:06.527 --> 20:09.266
I don't really see her tripping.

20:09.267 --> 20:11.071
(door rattling)

20:11.072 --> 20:12.049
- Did you hear that?

20:12.050 --> 20:13.560
- Who else you say in the house?

20:13.561 --> 20:14.651
- Nobody.

20:14.652 --> 20:17.902
- Wait right here, hold on, I'ma check.

20:27.522 --> 20:28.354
- [Jennifer] Who the hell was that?

20:28.355 --> 20:29.187
- Yo, somebody just
jumped outta the window,

20:29.188 --> 20:30.460
we gotta get outta here.

20:35.746 --> 20:37.119
- Thanks for inviting
me for drinks though,

20:37.120 --> 20:38.687
I had a great time with you.
- I know, I ain't even-

20:38.688 --> 20:39.627
- Whoa, whoa whoa!

20:39.628 --> 20:40.460
What's going on?

20:40.461 --> 20:41.293
- [James] Somebody just
jumped outta the window!

20:41.294 --> 20:42.126
- Honey, are you okay, baby?
- Yeah.

20:42.127 --> 20:43.417
- Look, I'ma see what's
going on, all right?

20:43.418 --> 20:45.102
- I'm coming too.

20:45.103 --> 20:45.962
- [James] Who is that?

20:45.963 --> 20:47.469
- That's my mom's new boyfriend.

20:47.470 --> 20:49.637
- Your ma's new boyfriend?

21:07.327 --> 21:08.160
- You okay?

21:10.090 --> 21:12.393
- Yeah, thank you so much for everything.

21:13.240 --> 21:14.899
- No problem.

21:14.900 --> 21:18.169
So I checked the doors and windows,

21:18.170 --> 21:20.234
everything is locked, so...

21:20.235 --> 21:21.985
- You 'bout to leave?

21:23.010 --> 21:24.823
- Yeah, it's getting pretty late.

21:26.190 --> 21:28.893
- Please don't leave, can
you just spend the night?

21:33.987 --> 21:37.379
- I don't really know if
that's such a good idea.

21:37.380 --> 21:40.683
- It's just I don't wanna
be by myself tonight.

21:41.590 --> 21:43.283
Please just stay for one night.

21:46.050 --> 21:48.589
- Okay, but just for tonight.

21:48.590 --> 21:49.423
- Thank you.

21:52.020 --> 21:55.049
All right, so I'm gonna
go check on Jennifer.

21:55.050 --> 21:56.963
You fix yourself something to drink

21:56.964 --> 21:58.763
and make yourself at home, okay?

22:10.919 --> 22:13.397
(knuckles rapping)

22:13.398 --> 22:14.231
- Hey.

22:15.470 --> 22:17.319
- You okay, babe?

22:17.320 --> 22:19.656
- Yeah, I'm still a little shaken up.

22:19.657 --> 22:21.149
- Yeah, I know.

22:21.150 --> 22:22.757
I'm glad you're okay though.

22:23.730 --> 22:26.109
But look, don't think
we're not gon' talk about

22:26.110 --> 22:28.859
you having James in here
while I wasn't home.

22:28.860 --> 22:30.351
- Sorry.

22:30.352 --> 22:31.929
- Mm-hm.

22:31.930 --> 22:33.279
Get some rest, baby, okay?

22:33.280 --> 22:34.113
- Yes, ma'am.

22:43.907 --> 22:46.324
(soft music)

23:00.379 --> 23:01.796
- Damn.

23:01.797 --> 23:02.933
You look amazing.

23:04.560 --> 23:08.797
- Grab me a glass of wine
and meet me in the bedroom.

23:12.170 --> 23:14.920
(acoustic music)

25:36.390 --> 25:39.409
Hey, baby, I'm sorry, I
had to leave to go to work,

25:39.410 --> 25:42.689
but I will see you when I get home, okay?

25:42.690 --> 25:43.847
All right, bye-bye.

25:51.605 --> 25:54.022
(calm music)

26:11.074 --> 26:11.907
Hello?

26:13.560 --> 26:15.889
Girl, please don't judge me

26:15.890 --> 26:18.389
after I tell you what happened last night.

26:18.390 --> 26:20.119
- You dirty hoe.

26:20.120 --> 26:22.649
You gave him some already?

26:22.650 --> 26:24.903
- Girl, it kinda just happened, okay?

26:26.140 --> 26:27.509
- Oh, let me guess,

26:27.510 --> 26:29.960
he slipped and fell in the pooh pooh, huh?

26:31.641 --> 26:34.003
- Girl, I just feel safe with him.

26:34.004 --> 26:38.787
Like it just feels different,
you know what I mean?

26:38.788 --> 26:41.339
- A man with a nice-sized bank account

26:41.340 --> 26:43.039
will make you feel that way.

26:43.040 --> 26:44.043
I'm just saying.

26:45.090 --> 26:46.990
- Girl, it's not even about the money.

26:48.464 --> 26:50.399
- Girl, who you think you fooling?

26:50.400 --> 26:52.313
It's always about the money.

26:53.472 --> 26:55.309
(chuckles)

26:55.310 --> 26:57.436
Look, girl, my break is almost up.

26:57.437 --> 26:59.863
I'ma call you when I get off, all right?

26:59.864 --> 27:01.947
- Okay, I'll talk to you.

27:25.246 --> 27:27.226
- What the hell are you doing?

27:27.227 --> 27:28.979
- [Floyd] Oh, I'm sorry.

27:28.980 --> 27:30.680
Thought I had the house to myself.

27:31.607 --> 27:32.524
You hungry?

27:49.400 --> 27:50.273
- Hey, babe.

27:51.530 --> 27:52.389
Can you come over?

27:52.390 --> 27:53.590
It's my mom's boyfriend.

27:55.100 --> 27:56.500
- Aw, give the guy a chance.

27:58.317 --> 28:00.267
- No, he's like really creeping me out.

28:01.720 --> 28:03.479
No, he was standing in the kitchen naked.

28:03.480 --> 28:06.276
Like, standing in the kitchen
naked, just standing there.

28:06.277 --> 28:07.989
(chuckles)

28:07.990 --> 28:09.070
It's not funny!

28:09.071 --> 28:11.779
Like, I'm really scared, like...

28:11.780 --> 28:13.679
Can you just come over, please?

28:13.680 --> 28:15.359
- I'm sure he wasn't just
standing there naked,

28:15.360 --> 28:18.453
you prolly walked in while
he was doing something.

28:18.454 --> 28:20.563
- I don't give a damn
what he was about to do!

28:21.690 --> 28:24.159
He's creeping me out, I don't feel safe.

28:24.160 --> 28:24.993
Like...

28:26.296 --> 28:27.128
All right, hold on.

28:27.129 --> 28:28.209
Let me call you right back.

28:29.860 --> 28:30.693
Yes?

28:32.920 --> 28:36.773
- If you need anything,
and I mean anything,

28:41.619 --> 28:43.286
you know what to do.

28:52.883 --> 28:55.633
- Girl, my mimosa is really nice.

28:57.599 --> 28:59.682
- Glad you like it, girl.

29:01.837 --> 29:05.230
(indistinct chattering)

29:05.231 --> 29:06.064
A mess.

29:09.468 --> 29:11.291
- Where do you think you're going?

29:11.292 --> 29:13.999
- Me and James were gonna go hang out.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.349
- Uh-uh, not tonight, baby.

29:15.350 --> 29:17.309
I need to talk to you about a few things.

29:17.310 --> 29:19.990
- Ms. Hazel, I promise I'll
have her home within one hour.

29:19.991 --> 29:22.620
- Mm-mm, I said not tonight, James.

29:22.621 --> 29:24.170
- I'll see you.

29:24.171 --> 29:25.838
I'ma call you later.

29:30.967 --> 29:32.753
- And take all that makeup off.

29:34.630 --> 29:36.379
- Are you serious?

29:36.380 --> 29:39.319
Let that girl go have some fun.

29:39.320 --> 29:41.199
- Girl, Tonya, it's not that.

29:41.200 --> 29:42.929
Look, that psychic chick told me

29:42.930 --> 29:45.340
that James was gonna die a horrible death.

29:45.341 --> 29:47.909
I don't want Jennifer there
for that when it happens.

29:47.910 --> 29:50.829
- You cannot let some con artist

29:50.830 --> 29:54.246
come and dictate how you and
your daughter live your lives.

29:54.247 --> 29:57.291
That's ridiculous.
- Look, Tonya,

29:57.292 --> 29:59.683
I'm just looking out for
Jennifer, that's all.

30:00.650 --> 30:01.482
- You know what?

30:01.483 --> 30:02.939
When it's all said and done,

30:02.940 --> 30:04.863
that girl is gon' end up hating you.

30:06.435 --> 30:09.185
I'ma go ahead and get outta here.

30:24.509 --> 30:25.519
- Hey, Hazel, what's going on?

30:25.520 --> 30:27.559
- [Hazel] Kareem, what are you doing here?

30:27.560 --> 30:28.392
- So we can talk.

30:28.393 --> 30:29.383
Can I come in?

30:31.530 --> 30:33.447
- What do you want?

30:33.448 --> 30:36.237
- Just trying to figure out
what the fuck we're doing.

30:36.238 --> 30:38.459
What's going on with you?

30:38.460 --> 30:40.369
- We're not doing anything.

30:40.370 --> 30:43.279
You cheated on me with two
different girls, Kareem.

30:43.280 --> 30:44.273
- Whoa, whoa.

30:45.455 --> 30:46.429
You still living in the past.

30:46.430 --> 30:48.936
Why you acting like that?

30:48.937 --> 30:51.743
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, it's
gotta be the church boy.

30:52.756 --> 30:56.049
You can't be really feeling
this nigga, not really.

30:56.050 --> 30:56.882
I mean, what is it?

30:56.883 --> 30:57.723
Is it the money?

30:59.800 --> 31:03.029
- Look, everything is
not about money, sir.

31:03.030 --> 31:06.096
He actually treats me like
a woman and not some hoe.

31:06.097 --> 31:08.209
And plus, he has class.

31:08.210 --> 31:09.219
- Oh, okay, okay.

31:09.220 --> 31:10.599
You know, every...

31:10.600 --> 31:13.834
Nigga put a collared shirt
on, now they got class.

31:13.835 --> 31:15.252
Man, y'all kill me with that.

31:15.253 --> 31:16.753
Man, come on, man.

31:17.620 --> 31:20.889
- Kareem, look, I think
it's time for you to leave.

31:20.890 --> 31:21.722
- Leave?

31:21.723 --> 31:23.818
I thought I should
stick around a lil' bit.

31:23.819 --> 31:26.736
(knuckles rapping)

31:29.031 --> 31:30.698
- [Hazel] Hey, babe.

31:39.540 --> 31:42.723
- Am I interrupting something?

31:42.724 --> 31:44.159
- Don't be ridiculous.

31:44.160 --> 31:45.889
Kareem was just leaving.

31:45.890 --> 31:47.273
Isn't that right, Kareem?

31:47.274 --> 31:48.379
- Leaving?

31:48.380 --> 31:51.033
Think I'll stick around a little bit.

31:51.034 --> 31:53.169
You don't got a problem
with me being here, do you?

31:53.170 --> 31:55.879
- Kareem, we are not doing this tonight.

31:55.880 --> 31:57.269
I want you to leave now!

31:57.270 --> 31:59.209
- Doing what?

31:59.210 --> 32:00.299
Chilling.

32:00.300 --> 32:02.286
Do you have a problem with me being here?

32:02.287 --> 32:03.287
- Oh my God.

32:05.830 --> 32:07.103
- Okay, listen, brother,

32:09.500 --> 32:11.963
violence doesn't solve anything, okay?

32:12.810 --> 32:15.429
Now the lady asked you nicely to leave,

32:15.430 --> 32:16.919
so I think that it would be best for you

32:16.920 --> 32:20.169
to respect her house and her wishes.

32:20.170 --> 32:21.369
- You right, what the fuck am I thinking?

32:21.370 --> 32:24.754
He got these nice flowers and everything.

32:24.755 --> 32:25.839
- What did you...

32:25.840 --> 32:27.944
What are you doing?

32:27.945 --> 32:29.489
- [Kareem] Doing?

32:29.490 --> 32:30.322
- Get the...

32:30.323 --> 32:31.406
Kareem, move!

32:32.725 --> 32:33.808
Move, Kareem!

32:34.942 --> 32:35.775
Move!

32:36.650 --> 32:38.089
Get the hell out before I call the cops!

32:38.090 --> 32:40.919
- These the type of niggas
you want around here?

32:40.920 --> 32:42.003
- Just leave!

32:49.756 --> 32:51.506
- Man.
- Are you okay?

32:52.430 --> 32:54.619
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

32:54.620 --> 32:55.869
- I'm so sorry, babe.

32:55.870 --> 32:58.029
- What the hell was he even doing here?

32:58.030 --> 32:59.093
- He just stopped by.

33:00.870 --> 33:01.739
- So you're just telling me

33:01.740 --> 33:03.959
that he just popped up out the blue?

33:03.960 --> 33:06.919
How random do these popups occur?

33:06.920 --> 33:09.120
- Floyd, baby, I swear
I'm not lying to you.

33:10.906 --> 33:11.738
- You know what?

33:11.739 --> 33:13.059
I think I'm just gonna go.

33:13.060 --> 33:14.659
- Wait, why?

33:14.660 --> 33:17.059
- Look, I just think that it's best.

33:17.060 --> 33:18.060
Here's your flowers.

33:31.990 --> 33:33.841
- What's on your mind?

33:33.842 --> 33:35.277
- I think we should tell your mother.

33:35.278 --> 33:36.479
- What, that I'm pregnant?

33:36.480 --> 33:38.289
- Yeah, we can't keep hiding.

33:38.290 --> 33:40.069
Plus, she been feeling way better

33:40.070 --> 33:42.069
since she been with that new man Floyd,

33:42.070 --> 33:43.609
so this the perfect time.

33:43.610 --> 33:45.729
- Yeah, I'll tell her tonight

33:45.730 --> 33:48.354
and you can be with me when I tell her.

33:48.355 --> 33:49.646
- You think that's a good idea?

33:49.647 --> 33:51.383
- You know, we a team, right?

33:53.106 --> 33:56.214
All right, then we do everything together.

33:56.215 --> 33:58.882
(ominous music)

34:22.465 --> 34:24.297
(knuckles rapping)

34:24.298 --> 34:25.131
- Come in.

34:30.093 --> 34:31.352
- Hey, mom, do you got a second?

34:31.353 --> 34:32.729
- Of course, baby, yeah.

34:32.730 --> 34:33.947
What's on your mind?

34:35.107 --> 34:38.333
- So, first of all, I love you.

34:38.334 --> 34:40.434
And second of all-
- We're having a baby.

34:41.323 --> 34:42.155
(chuckles)

34:42.156 --> 34:45.025
- Wait a minute, James, this
ain't the time for jokes, okay?

34:45.026 --> 34:45.858
- I'm not joking.

34:45.859 --> 34:47.176
Me and Jennifer is having a baby

34:47.177 --> 34:48.827
and we would like your blessings.

34:50.880 --> 34:52.729
- James, can you give me and Jennifer

34:52.730 --> 34:54.739
a moment alone, please?

34:54.740 --> 34:55.773
Thanks, honey.

35:00.950 --> 35:02.979
What the hell are you thinking?

35:02.980 --> 35:03.965
- What?

35:03.966 --> 35:05.216
- What do you mean, what?

35:06.200 --> 35:08.669
Why are you throwing your life away?

35:08.670 --> 35:10.079
What's the rush?

35:10.080 --> 35:11.499
Why can't y'all just wait?

35:11.500 --> 35:12.409
- What do you mean, what?

35:12.410 --> 35:13.469
I'm already pregnant.

35:13.470 --> 35:15.479
- What about school?

35:15.480 --> 35:17.419
Look, I'm not trying
to tell you what to do,

35:17.420 --> 35:20.119
but why are you throwing your life away?

35:20.120 --> 35:20.952
- What are you saying?

35:20.953 --> 35:22.429
You threw your life away when you had me?

35:22.430 --> 35:24.969
- Look, that's not what I'm saying.

35:24.970 --> 35:27.159
Jennifer, you are young!

35:27.160 --> 35:27.993
Jennifer!

35:32.530 --> 35:35.197
(ominous music)

35:50.759 --> 35:53.680
(flesh squishing)

35:53.681 --> 35:56.050
- [Floyd] That motherfucking
shit you was talking, man.

35:56.051 --> 35:57.051
That's my bitch now.

35:58.090 --> 35:59.773
I should set yo ass on fire.

36:01.901 --> 36:04.318
(soft music)

36:27.990 --> 36:28.823
- Hello?

36:30.290 --> 36:31.716
- What's up?

36:31.717 --> 36:35.429
- Damn, you haven't called me in days,

36:35.430 --> 36:37.780
and this how you're
answering the phone for me?

36:39.080 --> 36:39.912
- Look, sorry.

36:39.913 --> 36:41.409
I'm sorry, I just been busy.

36:41.410 --> 36:42.243
What's up?

36:44.010 --> 36:48.319
- Look, I just wanted to
apologize for the other night.

36:48.320 --> 36:51.620
Kareem had no right to put
his hands on you like that.

36:54.466 --> 36:56.142
- It's all good.

36:56.143 --> 36:57.353
What you been up to?

36:59.350 --> 37:00.672
- Missing you.

37:00.673 --> 37:02.719
(laughs)

37:02.720 --> 37:04.949
Nah, nothing.

37:04.950 --> 37:07.519
I'm just sitting in this house.

37:07.520 --> 37:09.853
You know, I could use a little company.

37:13.090 --> 37:14.090
- Is that an invite?

37:15.560 --> 37:17.049
- Yes.

37:17.050 --> 37:18.303
Can you come over?

37:20.960 --> 37:22.060
- I'm on my way, baby.

37:23.720 --> 37:25.783
- All right, see you soon.

37:34.218 --> 37:36.885
(ominous music)

37:43.382 --> 37:45.792
- Don't you think we
should talk to your mother?

37:45.793 --> 37:47.287
- I don't have nothing to say to her.

37:47.288 --> 37:49.803
I mean, it's my decision
and she's gonna respect it.

37:49.804 --> 37:51.970
I mean, I'm not a baby anymore.

37:51.971 --> 37:55.076
- I understand what you
saying, but that's your mother.

37:55.077 --> 37:57.025
That's not something worth
ruining y'all relationship over.

37:57.026 --> 37:59.314
- Look, I'm not getting rid of our baby.

37:59.315 --> 38:01.660
I don't care what she says.

38:01.661 --> 38:03.511
I mean, if it ruins it, then oh well.

38:04.720 --> 38:06.199
- Hey, it's getting kinda late.

38:06.200 --> 38:08.299
- Oh my God.
- Everything okay out here?

38:08.300 --> 38:09.899
- Look, man, don't walk
up on us like that.

38:09.900 --> 38:11.050
Fuck is wrong with you?

38:13.991 --> 38:16.849
- Well, I mean, it's kinda
late but I'm not the enemy,

38:16.850 --> 38:18.176
I'm just here to help.

38:18.177 --> 38:19.749
- I don't need your help,
and if you don't mind,

38:19.750 --> 38:22.009
me and my girl is having
a personal conversation

38:22.010 --> 38:24.129
and we'd appreciate if you bounced.

38:24.130 --> 38:25.649
- Hmm.

38:25.650 --> 38:27.639
Jennifer, it's getting kinda late.

38:27.640 --> 38:28.479
Let me take you home.

38:28.480 --> 38:30.793
- I'm not going anywhere with
you. You're not my father.

38:32.484 --> 38:33.317
- I see.

38:34.420 --> 38:35.520
I'll see y'all around.

38:37.870 --> 38:38.959
- [James] I don't like him.

38:38.960 --> 38:41.400
He fucking creepy, I'ma
keep an eye on him.

39:01.313 --> 39:02.252
- Hey, baby.

39:02.253 --> 39:03.086
- Hey, baby.

39:04.168 --> 39:06.512
- I didn't think you were still coming.

39:06.513 --> 39:08.633
- Well, I try my best to keep my word.

39:11.190 --> 39:12.023
What's wrong?

39:14.940 --> 39:16.639
- It's Jennifer.

39:16.640 --> 39:19.029
Me and her got into this
big fight the other day

39:19.030 --> 39:22.333
and she told me she was pregnant.

39:23.690 --> 39:24.913
- Are you serious?

39:26.851 --> 39:30.059
- Yeah, and I've just
been so worried about her.

39:30.060 --> 39:32.960
I haven't seen or spoken
to her in the past week.

39:35.130 --> 39:39.629
- Well, you can rest
assured, Jennifer is fine,

39:39.630 --> 39:42.389
actually just saw her outside
in the car with James.

39:42.390 --> 39:43.929
They were talking.

39:43.930 --> 39:45.230
Like I said, she was fine.

39:47.020 --> 39:47.852
- I don't know.

39:47.853 --> 39:51.269
It's like ever sense I
saw that psychic chick,

39:51.270 --> 39:55.483
I've just been like paranoid or something.

39:55.484 --> 39:56.489
- Hold on, hold on.

39:56.490 --> 39:57.809
Psychic?

39:57.810 --> 39:59.703
Like the ones you see on the commercials?

40:00.930 --> 40:03.203
Now you know they're
just in it to make money.

40:04.660 --> 40:05.510
What did she say?

40:07.580 --> 40:11.940
- She told me that James was
gonna die a horrible death,

40:11.941 --> 40:15.099
and every time I see
Jennifer leave the house,

40:15.100 --> 40:17.639
I'm just like, I'm scared.

40:17.640 --> 40:20.093
Like what if she doesn't
come back home or something?

40:21.540 --> 40:25.429
- Listen, baby, you can't live your life

40:25.430 --> 40:27.789
in fear like that, all right?

40:27.790 --> 40:31.023
James is gonna be fine,
Jennifer is gonna be fine.

40:32.967 --> 40:33.799
I ain't even know that people

40:33.800 --> 40:35.343
actually still listened to psychics.

40:36.950 --> 40:38.580
- She even told me that...

40:41.490 --> 40:42.890
I should stay away from you.

40:44.380 --> 40:46.180
Like you're no good for me or something.

40:46.181 --> 40:47.014
I...

40:50.207 --> 40:51.407
- Now that's disturbing.

40:53.090 --> 40:55.019
- I mean, if I believed her,

40:55.020 --> 40:57.120
you wouldn't still be standing right here.

40:58.697 --> 40:59.530
But...

41:03.447 --> 41:07.037
- It's gonna be okay, baby.

41:07.038 --> 41:09.463
Can I get one of these?

41:09.464 --> 41:12.047
(upbeat music)

41:22.080 --> 41:23.529
- What?

41:23.530 --> 41:25.499
Are you serious?

41:25.500 --> 41:26.332
- Yes.

41:26.333 --> 41:28.853
Set his black ass on fire.

41:31.290 --> 41:34.069
- Who would do something like that?

41:34.070 --> 41:36.373
Like I know Kareem was an asshole,

41:37.420 --> 41:39.559
but he didn't deserve that.

41:39.560 --> 41:40.610
That's a bit extreme.

41:41.510 --> 41:43.282
- Look, who knows?

41:43.283 --> 41:45.979
Kareem had so many enemies.

41:45.980 --> 41:47.480
I just thought you'd be happy.

41:48.580 --> 41:49.413
- Happy?

41:50.300 --> 41:53.149
Look, Kareem and I had our problems,

41:53.150 --> 41:55.367
but that doesn't mean
I wanted his ass dead.

41:56.360 --> 42:00.399
- Well, I know who is
happy, and that's Floyd.

42:00.400 --> 42:02.649
Speaking of that, where is Floyd?

42:02.650 --> 42:04.163
Where is Mr. Wonderful?

42:05.520 --> 42:08.030
- Girl, he's in the house.

42:08.031 --> 42:11.997
I'ma hit you when I get off, all right?

42:11.998 --> 42:12.831
All right.

42:16.612 --> 42:17.445
Damn.

42:21.442 --> 42:24.192
(shower running)

43:08.743 --> 43:10.643
- Did you just open the bathroom door?

43:13.330 --> 43:14.489
- Bathroom door?

43:14.490 --> 43:16.068
- Yeah.

43:16.069 --> 43:17.169
I heard the door open.

43:19.090 --> 43:20.340
- Must be hearing things.

43:48.640 --> 43:51.149
- Hey, baby, can you come over, please?

43:51.150 --> 43:52.830
- Of course, what's wrong?

43:54.010 --> 43:55.686
- I'm here in the house alone with Floyd

43:55.687 --> 43:57.539
and he's really creeping me out.

43:57.540 --> 43:59.309
I could have sworn I saw
him peek in the bathroom

43:59.310 --> 44:00.849
when I was taking a shower.

44:00.850 --> 44:02.839
- What? I'm finna come over
there and kick his ass!

44:02.840 --> 44:05.459
- No, no, no, no, I'm not sure.

44:05.460 --> 44:06.359
I just...

44:06.360 --> 44:07.192
I think so.

44:07.193 --> 44:09.179
I mean, can you hurry up, please?

44:09.180 --> 44:10.433
- All right, I'm on my way.

44:18.261 --> 44:20.511
- Three, four, five, six...

44:27.055 --> 44:27.888
Ooh.

44:33.620 --> 44:34.483
May I help you?

44:48.100 --> 44:49.833
- I heard you were the best.

44:52.040 --> 44:54.629
I'm here to get my fortune told.

44:54.630 --> 44:55.463
- Oh, okay.

44:56.330 --> 44:57.343
Sure thing.

44:58.977 --> 45:00.599
There's one thing about
this establishment,

45:00.600 --> 45:02.349
we don't allow any alcohol.

45:02.350 --> 45:04.463
So would you please pour that alcohol out?

45:07.700 --> 45:08.533
- Is that right?

45:17.090 --> 45:19.369
You don't know who I am, do you?

45:19.370 --> 45:20.423
- [Teresa] Excuse me?

45:23.664 --> 45:25.064
- I mean, you are a psychic.

45:26.600 --> 45:30.613
So you would know who
I am and why I'm here.

45:31.650 --> 45:33.379
- Oh, okay.

45:33.380 --> 45:34.899
I'm sorry, it doesn't work that way.

45:34.900 --> 45:38.979
So, if you want a reading, I
have to get my cards together

45:38.980 --> 45:40.379
and then I can do your reading.

45:40.380 --> 45:45.380
But like I said, you have
to throw out your alcohol.

46:01.105 --> 46:03.188
(grunts)

46:06.741 --> 46:07.574
Please.

46:08.984 --> 46:09.817
Please.

46:10.809 --> 46:12.288
Please.

46:12.289 --> 46:14.103
Oh my God, please.

46:14.104 --> 46:16.187
(grunts)

46:51.170 --> 46:55.147
- Next time you feel the need
to read someone's future,

46:57.600 --> 46:59.300
make sure you know your own first.

47:10.710 --> 47:12.149
- Thank you for spending
the night with me, baby.

47:12.150 --> 47:14.031
- You don't thank me for that.

47:14.032 --> 47:16.699
As your man, I'm supposed
to be here to hold you down.

47:16.700 --> 47:19.309
- Yeah, I think I've
just been overthinking.

47:19.310 --> 47:20.879
You know they say during pregnancy,

47:20.880 --> 47:22.709
women tend to get overemotional,

47:22.710 --> 47:25.743
so maybe my mind has just
been playing tricks on me.

47:29.527 --> 47:30.419
- Hell no!

47:30.420 --> 47:32.120
Yo, what the hell is your problem?

47:34.070 --> 47:34.902
- What you mean?

47:34.903 --> 47:36.852
- Yo, you ain't the only
motherfucker in this house.

47:36.853 --> 47:39.703
I'ma tell you this one time,
put some fucking clothes on.

47:43.230 --> 47:44.279
- And if I don't?

47:44.280 --> 47:45.629
- No, baby.

47:45.630 --> 47:47.015
Let's go, it's not worth it.

47:47.016 --> 47:48.683
- [James] All right.

48:11.483 --> 48:13.699
- Hey, baby, what's wrong?

48:13.700 --> 48:15.589
- It's Floyd, he has to go.

48:15.590 --> 48:16.422
- What?

48:16.423 --> 48:17.932
Calm down, what are you talking about?

48:17.933 --> 48:19.859
- It's Floyd, he's been
walking around naked

48:19.860 --> 48:21.506
and I don't feel safe with him here.

48:21.507 --> 48:22.609
- What?

48:22.610 --> 48:23.442
Walking around naked?

48:23.443 --> 48:24.406
What do you mean?

48:24.407 --> 48:26.287
- What don't you understand,
ma? He's a pervert.

48:26.950 --> 48:28.749
- Look, I will talk to Floyd

48:28.750 --> 48:30.839
and we will get to the
bottom of this, okay?

48:30.840 --> 48:31.672
- Talk to him?

48:31.673 --> 48:33.249
No, you need to kick his ass out.

48:33.250 --> 48:34.200
- Watch your mouth.

48:35.510 --> 48:36.500
I'll be right back.

49:00.840 --> 49:02.129
Hey, baby.

49:02.130 --> 49:03.329
- Hey, baby.

49:03.330 --> 49:04.383
- We need to talk.

49:05.505 --> 49:06.338
- 'Sup?

49:09.820 --> 49:13.033
- Jennifer said that you're
walking around here naked.

49:17.170 --> 49:21.149
- Yeah, I thought I had
the house to myself,

49:21.150 --> 49:22.409
clearly I didn't.

49:22.410 --> 49:24.039
I was trying to fix something to eat.

49:24.040 --> 49:26.283
It was just a big misunderstanding.

49:27.320 --> 49:29.659
Come on now, look at
me, do I look the type

49:29.660 --> 49:31.689
that would just be walking
around the house naked,

49:31.690 --> 49:33.240
knowing there's company around?

49:34.440 --> 49:35.589
- Look, I know, baby.

49:35.590 --> 49:38.163
But look, she's really
freaking out about this.

49:41.390 --> 49:44.049
- Look, I understand that
it would be kinda difficult

49:44.050 --> 49:46.819
trying to adjust with me being around.

49:46.820 --> 49:48.770
Maybe I should just go and talk to her.

49:50.173 --> 49:51.728
- That's a good idea, babe.

49:51.729 --> 49:52.869
Look, you go do that

49:52.870 --> 49:54.943
and I'm gonna go hop in the shower, okay?

49:55.950 --> 49:56.783
- Okay, baby.

50:01.627 --> 50:02.459
(gasps)

50:02.460 --> 50:05.487
- What the hell are you doing in my room?

50:07.287 --> 50:09.913
- Listen to me very
carefully, you little bitch.

50:11.120 --> 50:14.013
Your mother belongs to me now.

50:15.270 --> 50:16.723
So you better get used to it.

50:17.800 --> 50:19.909
- You may have my mama fooled,

50:19.910 --> 50:22.453
but I'm onto you and your perverted ways.

50:26.770 --> 50:28.620
- I see the way you be looking at me.

50:30.122 --> 50:33.043
But don't worry, I'ma
fix you up real nice.

50:58.890 --> 51:00.059
- What the hell is so important

51:00.060 --> 51:03.009
that I had to leave my job
to come and meet you here?

51:03.010 --> 51:05.749
- I'm sorry to bother
you, but it's about Floyd.

51:05.750 --> 51:07.359
- What about him?

51:07.360 --> 51:09.219
- He's not who he claims to be,

51:09.220 --> 51:10.870
and I'ma get to the bottom of it.

51:11.760 --> 51:13.859
- The bottom of what?

51:13.860 --> 51:15.339
- He's been walking around naked

51:15.340 --> 51:19.620
and been saying slick
inappropriate things to me, and...

51:20.740 --> 51:22.609
- Does your mother know about this?

51:22.610 --> 51:25.589
- Yes, but she's too into this guy

51:25.590 --> 51:28.009
to see what he's really up to.

51:28.010 --> 51:28.842
- And what's that?

51:28.843 --> 51:31.787
- I don't know but I'm gon' find out.

51:36.579 --> 51:37.629
- Damn, baby, you been
sitting on that computer

51:37.630 --> 51:38.709
for over three hours.

51:38.710 --> 51:40.779
You might as well give it a rest.

51:40.780 --> 51:41.919
- Baby, I can't.

51:41.920 --> 51:44.853
I have to expose this guy
for the scumbag he really is.

51:45.846 --> 51:47.199
- You need to relax for the baby.

51:47.200 --> 51:50.390
I told you if he do anything
else, I'ma handle him.

51:52.963 --> 51:54.919
- I think it's time we get our own place.

51:54.920 --> 51:57.513
I don't see my mom like
leaving this guy Floyd.

51:59.142 --> 51:59.974
- Going to work.

51:59.975 --> 52:01.579
What you wanna eat later?

52:01.580 --> 52:02.683
- Surprise me.

52:02.684 --> 52:03.517
- Okay.

52:13.880 --> 52:14.909
- Hey, girl.

52:14.910 --> 52:16.879
We need to talk.

52:16.880 --> 52:19.429
- Why you sound so serious?

52:19.430 --> 52:21.233
- Jennifer came to see me today,

52:22.330 --> 52:27.330
and she's really uncomfortable
when Floyd is around.

52:28.050 --> 52:29.993
- Oh my God, not this again.

52:30.870 --> 52:34.409
Why every time I find
somebody that makes me happy,

52:34.410 --> 52:36.463
everybody starts to act like this?

52:38.590 --> 52:42.219
- I thought you might say
something foolish like that.

52:42.220 --> 52:45.529
So I really had a moment
to think about it.

52:45.530 --> 52:49.259
Maybe that psychic chick was right.

52:49.260 --> 52:50.869
- Are you serious?

52:50.870 --> 52:52.919
- Something's just not right with him.

52:52.920 --> 52:56.723
So, I took the liberty
to go past her shop,

52:57.950 --> 53:00.239
she was murdered.

53:00.240 --> 53:03.749
Someone set her shop on fire.

53:03.750 --> 53:06.669
- Look, Tonya, I'm not
doing this with you.

53:06.670 --> 53:09.489
Floyd is a good man, okay?

53:09.490 --> 53:13.383
And if you and Jennifer
don't like it, so be it.

53:15.118 --> 53:16.859
- Hello?

53:16.860 --> 53:18.329
- Who's this?

53:18.330 --> 53:20.619
- What you mean, who this?

53:20.620 --> 53:22.051
- Hey, baby, what's up?

53:22.052 --> 53:23.267
You just getting off?

53:23.268 --> 53:25.435
- You better stop playing.

53:26.930 --> 53:30.606
Nah, I was calling to see if
you and my baby wanted to eat.

53:30.607 --> 53:33.119
- All you care about is
this baby in my stomach.

53:33.120 --> 53:36.099
You prolly could care
less if I ate or not.

53:36.100 --> 53:38.000
- Ooh, that's farthest from the truth.

53:38.881 --> 53:40.535
(grunts)

53:40.536 --> 53:41.369
- James?

53:43.903 --> 53:45.988
What's going on?

53:45.989 --> 53:46.822
James!

53:53.855 --> 53:55.637
- [James] I gotta be in my child's life.

53:57.340 --> 53:58.390
- That's my baby now.

53:59.560 --> 54:03.833
And don't worry, I'ma take
real good care of Jennifer.

54:21.160 --> 54:24.359
- Mommy, I think something
bad just happened to James.

54:24.360 --> 54:25.192
- Babe, slow down.

54:25.193 --> 54:26.880
Start from the beginning.

54:26.881 --> 54:27.957
- I was just on the phone with him,

54:27.958 --> 54:29.593
then all of a sudden, I heard
him struggling with somebody

54:29.594 --> 54:32.351
and the phone went dead.

54:32.352 --> 54:33.699
- I'm sure James is fine, baby.

54:33.700 --> 54:34.919
Calm down.

54:34.920 --> 54:36.159
Have you tried calling him back?

54:36.160 --> 54:38.389
- Mom, I tried calling him several times.

54:38.390 --> 54:40.317
I know Floyd had
something to do with this.

54:40.318 --> 54:41.199
- What?

54:41.200 --> 54:42.887
What does Floyd have
anything to do with this?

54:42.888 --> 54:43.839
- Everything!

54:43.840 --> 54:45.029
I mean, can't you see?

54:45.030 --> 54:47.813
Since he's been in our lives,
everything's been messed up.

54:49.570 --> 54:51.339
- Hey, babe, I'm glad you're here.

54:51.340 --> 54:53.179
Apparently, my daughter thinks

54:53.180 --> 54:55.530
that you're some type of
murderer or something.

54:56.890 --> 54:57.849
- A murderer?

54:57.850 --> 54:58.683
- Right?

54:59.520 --> 55:01.279
- Wow, well, what's going on?

55:01.280 --> 55:02.359
- Don't play stupid with me,

55:02.360 --> 55:04.029
you know exactly what's going on.

55:04.030 --> 55:05.080
What happen to James?

55:06.200 --> 55:08.819
- I have no idea what
you're talking about.

55:08.820 --> 55:09.968
Tell me what happen to James?

55:09.969 --> 55:11.676
- [Jennifer] Fuck you!

55:11.677 --> 55:14.233
- Don't you ever put your hands on my man!

55:16.330 --> 55:18.699
- So you're gonna choose a
stranger over your own daughter?

55:18.700 --> 55:21.029
- Listen, you are under my roof

55:21.030 --> 55:23.039
and you will not disrespect this house,

55:23.040 --> 55:26.490
and if you have a problem that,
you know where the door is.

55:28.493 --> 55:30.643
- I'll be back for my
things in a few days.

55:35.350 --> 55:36.568
- [Floyd] It's okay.

55:36.569 --> 55:38.249
- [Hazel] I don't know what to do anymore.

55:40.745 --> 55:42.495
She's out of control.

55:57.223 --> 55:58.083
- Hey, baby.

56:00.460 --> 56:01.453
You feel any better?

56:02.919 --> 56:04.948
- You know I'm ticklish.

56:04.949 --> 56:05.857
- I'm sorry.

56:05.858 --> 56:08.349
Glad I could make you smile though.

56:08.350 --> 56:09.800
You feeling any better, baby?

56:11.704 --> 56:12.537
- I don't know.

56:13.900 --> 56:16.309
I'm just really worried about Jennifer.

56:16.310 --> 56:19.043
I called her twice and she didn't pick up.

56:19.920 --> 56:21.313
I just hope she's okay.

56:23.370 --> 56:24.985
- Well, you know if you
wanna go out looking for her,

56:24.986 --> 56:26.697
I'll go with you.

56:26.698 --> 56:29.166
- I don't even know
where to start looking.

56:29.167 --> 56:31.119
I just know she's probably out

56:31.120 --> 56:33.577
riding around looking for James.

56:35.016 --> 56:35.848
- Yeah.

56:35.849 --> 56:37.463
I really hope that James is okay.

56:39.334 --> 56:41.743
He really seems like a decent young man.

56:43.046 --> 56:43.879
- Yeah.

56:45.028 --> 56:47.410
Let's get some rest, baby.

56:47.411 --> 56:50.136
I just want you to hold me.

56:50.137 --> 56:51.220
- Okay, baby.

56:55.820 --> 56:58.487
(ominous music)

57:05.160 --> 57:08.389
- What the hell are you doing
here at my house so late?

57:08.390 --> 57:09.223
- Are you busy?

57:10.080 --> 57:11.523
- Of course not, what's up?

57:12.740 --> 57:15.643
- Floyd killed James
and I'm gon' prove it.

57:16.700 --> 57:18.639
- Wait, wait.

57:18.640 --> 57:21.459
Slow down, are you serious?

57:21.460 --> 57:23.419
- Last time I talked
to James on the phone,

57:23.420 --> 57:24.359
it sounded like he was struggling

57:24.360 --> 57:27.329
with somebody in the background
and I know it was Floyd.

57:27.330 --> 57:28.669
I'm gonna prove it.

57:28.670 --> 57:29.870
But I'ma need your help.

57:32.270 --> 57:33.939
- This is a lot.

57:33.940 --> 57:35.199
Just...

57:35.200 --> 57:37.150
This sounds like it's gonna be trouble.

57:38.620 --> 57:41.219
- I've been doing my homework on Floyd,

57:41.220 --> 57:43.889
and when I looked in the
system, nothing came up.

57:43.890 --> 57:45.799
So I dug a little deeper

57:45.800 --> 57:48.919
and I found a few cases of a few murders

57:48.920 --> 57:50.929
where a man killed seven families

57:50.930 --> 57:53.443
and set their house on
fire and left 'em to die.

57:55.140 --> 57:57.293
- What does all this
have to do with Floyd?

57:58.560 --> 58:01.509
- One of the victims,
they managed to escape,

58:01.510 --> 58:04.429
and after doing a little
digging, I found her address.

58:04.430 --> 58:05.880
I need you to speak with her.

58:06.800 --> 58:09.609
I know she's going to
describe Floyd as the killer.

58:09.610 --> 58:13.069
- Jennifer, I understand
how you feel about Floyd,

58:13.070 --> 58:16.893
but don't you think you're
taking this a little too far?

58:17.920 --> 58:18.789
- Aunt Tonya, please,

58:18.790 --> 58:21.490
I really need you to do this
right now for me, please.

58:23.420 --> 58:24.619
- Okay.

58:24.620 --> 58:25.869
You get on my damn nerves.

58:25.870 --> 58:27.120
Just send me the address.

58:32.932 --> 58:34.079
- [Hazel] Here you go, babe.

58:34.080 --> 58:36.333
- Mm, we got here.

58:36.334 --> 58:38.096
- [Hazel] Eat up, eat up.

58:38.097 --> 58:38.930
- Mm.

58:42.970 --> 58:44.469
Okay.

58:44.470 --> 58:45.470
- Be honest with me.

58:46.400 --> 58:48.209
What do you think?

58:48.210 --> 58:49.043
- Mm.

58:52.690 --> 58:53.819
I like it.

58:53.820 --> 58:54.653
It's good.

58:56.160 --> 58:57.772
You sure you didn't order this?

58:57.773 --> 58:58.949
- Boy, don't play with me.

58:58.950 --> 59:01.563
I already told you I do
my thing in the kitchen.

59:02.607 --> 59:06.109
Besides, you know, they say
the best way to a man's heart

59:06.110 --> 59:07.913
is through his stomach.

59:10.680 --> 59:11.513
- Really?

59:12.790 --> 59:17.790
Well, you had my heart from
the first day that I met you.

59:18.930 --> 59:22.413
So, honestly, I could care
less if you could cook or not.

59:23.659 --> 59:28.659
- Ooh, so sweet, babe.

59:31.138 --> 59:36.138
You smell that?

59:36.170 --> 59:37.003
- Smell what?

59:39.300 --> 59:41.259
- Smells like gasoline or something.

59:41.260 --> 59:42.900
You don't smell that?

59:44.240 --> 59:47.407
I think it's coming from the basement.

59:49.844 --> 59:51.681
- Hold on a second,
baby, I'll be right back.

59:51.682 --> 59:52.682
- All right.

1:00:25.700 --> 1:00:30.660
- Yeah, babe, I think your
nose was playing tricks on you.

1:00:30.661 --> 1:00:32.322
I ain't smell anything.

1:00:32.323 --> 1:00:33.273
- Oh, that's weird.

1:00:34.270 --> 1:00:35.103
Okay.

1:00:36.790 --> 1:00:37.890
- This chicken though.

1:00:42.236 --> 1:00:43.909
And you're sure that you cooked this?

1:00:43.910 --> 1:00:44.742
(giggles)

1:00:44.743 --> 1:00:45.653
- Stop playing, yes!

1:00:47.090 --> 1:00:48.650
- You bite my chicken while I was gone?

1:00:49.906 --> 1:00:51.135
- [Hazel] Maybe.

1:00:51.136 --> 1:00:51.968
(laughs)

1:00:51.969 --> 1:00:53.567
- That's messed up.

1:00:53.568 --> 1:00:54.602
It's good though.

1:00:54.603 --> 1:00:55.436
- Good.

1:01:04.760 --> 1:01:05.899
- Hello?

1:01:05.900 --> 1:01:08.179
- Can I help you?
- Yes.

1:01:08.180 --> 1:01:09.099
I'm sorry to bother you,

1:01:09.100 --> 1:01:11.729
but I'm looking for an Alex, is it?

1:01:11.730 --> 1:01:13.059
- [Alex] I'm Alex.

1:01:13.060 --> 1:01:15.329
Is there something I can help you with?

1:01:15.330 --> 1:01:18.053
- Look, again, I am so
sorry to bother you.

1:01:19.530 --> 1:01:21.039
A friend of mine tracked you down

1:01:21.040 --> 1:01:22.479
and said that I needed to speak with you.

1:01:22.480 --> 1:01:24.859
But can I, I mean, can I come in?

1:01:24.860 --> 1:01:25.693
- [Alex] Yes.

1:01:29.330 --> 1:01:33.989
- As I said, a friend of
mine is dating this guy,

1:01:33.990 --> 1:01:36.009
and for some reason,

1:01:36.010 --> 1:01:39.489
her daughter seems to
believe that he's a murderer.

1:01:39.490 --> 1:01:40.763
She's just convinced.

1:01:41.690 --> 1:01:43.039
I was hoping that you can help me

1:01:43.040 --> 1:01:44.899
shed a little light on this.

1:01:44.900 --> 1:01:48.963
By chance, let me show
you, do you know him?

1:01:56.020 --> 1:01:57.000
- That man...

1:01:58.520 --> 1:02:02.373
Your friend and her daughter
is in serious danger.

1:02:03.490 --> 1:02:05.003
That man in that picture,

1:02:06.230 --> 1:02:09.322
he murdered my whole entire family.

1:02:09.323 --> 1:02:10.156
- What?

1:02:33.930 --> 1:02:35.519
- Hello?

1:02:35.520 --> 1:02:37.479
Wait, baby, look, don't hang up.

1:02:37.480 --> 1:02:39.012
I just wanna talk to you.

1:02:39.013 --> 1:02:40.963
- I don't have nothing to say to you.

1:02:43.570 --> 1:02:45.449
- So what are we supposed
to just walk around

1:02:45.450 --> 1:02:47.689
pretending like we don't know each other?

1:02:47.690 --> 1:02:49.619
- You chose a stranger over your daughter,

1:02:49.620 --> 1:02:51.363
like I guess I don't know you.

1:02:53.930 --> 1:02:58.029
- Listen, baby, why don't
you just meet me at my office

1:02:58.030 --> 1:02:59.980
and let's just talk face to face, okay?

1:03:01.120 --> 1:03:02.399
- Well, I just pulled up to the house,

1:03:02.400 --> 1:03:03.759
I'm grabbing the rest of my things

1:03:03.760 --> 1:03:06.710
and you'll never see me again
as long as you're with Floyd.

1:03:25.640 --> 1:03:27.869
- Can I get you something to drink?

1:03:27.870 --> 1:03:29.969
- Girl, no thank you.

1:03:29.970 --> 1:03:33.653
You have just blown my mind with all this.

1:03:35.200 --> 1:03:36.059
- Okay.

1:03:36.060 --> 1:03:38.139
So what would you like to know?

1:03:38.140 --> 1:03:41.669
- Tell me everything there
is to know about Floyd.

1:03:41.670 --> 1:03:44.993
- Oh, so he's going by that name now?

1:03:47.440 --> 1:03:52.023
Well, when I first him, he was
going by the name of Charles.

1:03:53.180 --> 1:03:54.710
Everything was all good

1:03:55.850 --> 1:03:59.973
until I smelled gasoline in my house.

1:04:01.890 --> 1:04:04.800
I went downstairs to see where
the smell was coming from

1:04:05.810 --> 1:04:09.747
and that's when I found
out who Charles really was.

1:04:12.010 --> 1:04:12.999
- What happen?

1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:16.009
- I found the canister of gasoline

1:04:16.010 --> 1:04:18.333
along with a bunch of hunting knives.

1:04:19.600 --> 1:04:22.933
I confronted him about it
and that's when he snapped.

1:04:24.996 --> 1:04:27.006
(grunts)

1:04:27.007 --> 1:04:29.684
- Didn't I tell you
don't get in my business?

1:04:29.685 --> 1:04:31.435
- [Alex] No, Charles!

1:04:42.052 --> 1:04:42.885
Charles!

1:04:49.469 --> 1:04:52.782
Please, Charles, don't do this!

1:04:52.783 --> 1:04:53.959
Please don't do this!

1:04:53.960 --> 1:04:55.369
You don't have to do this, Charles!

1:04:55.370 --> 1:04:56.203
Stop!

1:04:58.686 --> 1:04:59.519
- You know what?

1:05:03.070 --> 1:05:04.447
Yo pussy trash anyway.

1:05:19.893 --> 1:05:22.560
(ominous music)

1:05:30.830 --> 1:05:33.759
- Thank God I was able to wake up

1:05:33.760 --> 1:05:36.909
and make it out the house
before it burned down.

1:05:36.910 --> 1:05:39.749
- I'm so sorry to hear that.

1:05:39.750 --> 1:05:41.319
- I was lucky,

1:05:41.320 --> 1:05:44.083
but my family wasn't so
lucky to get out the house.

1:05:45.220 --> 1:05:49.423
- I am so, so sorry to hear that.

1:05:50.440 --> 1:05:54.539
- Your friend and her
daughter is in serious danger,

1:05:54.540 --> 1:05:56.239
has to get away from Charles.

1:05:56.240 --> 1:06:01.240
- My friend is super
convinced that Floyd, Charles,

1:06:03.120 --> 1:06:06.019
or whoever this man is supposed to be,

1:06:06.020 --> 1:06:09.899
is her dream man, she's
so in love with him.

1:06:09.900 --> 1:06:12.369
But her daughter can't stand him,

1:06:12.370 --> 1:06:14.099
she sees right through it.

1:06:14.100 --> 1:06:16.679
- Wait, how old is the daughter?

1:06:16.680 --> 1:06:18.193
- She just turned 19.

1:06:20.020 --> 1:06:23.539
- Oh, no, you have to get
that girl out that house.

1:06:23.540 --> 1:06:28.540
Not alone Charles is a
murderer, he's also a pedophile.

1:06:29.450 --> 1:06:30.283
- What the hell?

1:06:31.510 --> 1:06:33.773
Hazel, it's me.

1:06:34.670 --> 1:06:35.693
Where are you?

1:06:38.270 --> 1:06:39.453
I need to talk to you.

1:06:40.920 --> 1:06:43.519
Floyd isn't who he says he is.

1:06:43.520 --> 1:06:46.123
I just got finished talking
to one of his victims.

1:06:47.030 --> 1:06:49.123
You need to stay away from him.

1:06:50.060 --> 1:06:51.129
- What?

1:06:51.130 --> 1:06:52.429
One of his victims?

1:06:52.430 --> 1:06:54.149
What are you talking about, girl?

1:06:54.150 --> 1:06:55.193
- Where is Jennifer?

1:06:56.370 --> 1:06:59.299
- She's at the house collecting
the rest of her things.

1:06:59.300 --> 1:07:04.300
- Hazel, you have to get to
your house to get Jennifer.

1:07:04.470 --> 1:07:06.469
She is not safe.

1:07:06.470 --> 1:07:08.439
- Tonya, what are you saying?

1:07:08.440 --> 1:07:13.183
- Bitch, get yo ass to yo house
right now and get Jennifer!

1:07:14.070 --> 1:07:15.027
I'm on my way.

1:07:47.918 --> 1:07:49.501
- Well, well, well.

1:07:51.603 --> 1:07:52.729
What brings you down here?

1:07:52.730 --> 1:07:53.993
- I smell gasoline.

1:08:06.240 --> 1:08:07.590
- [Floyd] Playtime is over.

1:08:10.387 --> 1:08:11.487
- Floyd, I'm pregnant!

1:08:13.363 --> 1:08:14.899
- It's okay because I
heard that pregnant pussy

1:08:14.900 --> 1:08:15.800
is the best pussy.

1:08:18.330 --> 1:08:19.507
That's my baby now.

1:08:26.218 --> 1:08:27.873
- Get off me, no!

1:08:27.874 --> 1:08:28.706
- Wanna do it right.

1:08:28.707 --> 1:08:30.874
(screams)

1:08:31.839 --> 1:08:33.506
- No, get off of me!

1:08:34.953 --> 1:08:35.785
- Saw the way you was looking at me!

1:08:35.786 --> 1:08:37.119
- Get off of me!

1:08:39.141 --> 1:08:40.308
Get off of me!

1:08:41.459 --> 1:08:43.315
(screams)

1:08:43.316 --> 1:08:44.149
No!

1:08:45.723 --> 1:08:46.556
No!

1:08:48.410 --> 1:08:49.243
No!

1:09:03.770 --> 1:09:06.282
- Floyd, what the fuck are you doing?

1:09:06.283 --> 1:09:07.450
What the fuck?

1:09:10.550 --> 1:09:11.550
- Hey, baby.

1:09:12.567 --> 1:09:14.230
Just in time.

1:09:14.231 --> 1:09:16.768
- [Hazel] Don't you come any closer.

1:09:16.769 --> 1:09:17.602
Move!

1:09:19.621 --> 1:09:20.954
- Come on, baby.

1:09:22.482 --> 1:09:23.482
Piss me off.

1:09:26.358 --> 1:09:28.404
- Floyd!
- You did this!

1:09:28.405 --> 1:09:29.738
- [Hazel] Floyd!

1:09:31.258 --> 1:09:32.091
Floyd!

1:09:33.147 --> 1:09:33.980
Floyd!

1:09:38.626 --> 1:09:39.942
Floyd!

1:09:39.943 --> 1:09:41.708
Floyd, please!

1:09:41.709 --> 1:09:44.612
You don't have to do this!

1:09:44.613 --> 1:09:45.446
Floyd!

1:09:48.269 --> 1:09:49.705
Floyd!

1:09:49.706 --> 1:09:52.456
You don't have to do this, Floyd!

1:09:53.489 --> 1:09:55.013
Floyd!

1:09:55.014 --> 1:09:56.796
- I'm doing God's work.

1:09:56.797 --> 1:09:59.471
(sobs)

1:09:59.472 --> 1:10:00.805
- [Hazel] Floyd!

1:10:06.243 --> 1:10:09.107
Floyd, you don't have to do this!

1:10:09.108 --> 1:10:13.596
Stop!
(gun fires)

1:10:13.597 --> 1:10:14.929
- [Jennifer] Get away from her, bitch,

1:10:14.930 --> 1:10:17.180
or I'll blow your head off.

1:10:19.358 --> 1:10:21.358
Don't take another step.

1:10:24.652 --> 1:10:25.485
- Do it.

1:10:27.057 --> 1:10:27.890
Do it!

1:10:30.573 --> 1:10:32.143
- Shoot his ass!

1:10:32.144 --> 1:10:32.977
Shoot him!

1:10:35.253 --> 1:10:36.503
- Do that shit.

1:10:38.481 --> 1:10:39.314
Shoot.

1:10:42.610 --> 1:10:43.443
Do it.

1:10:47.711 --> 1:10:50.815
Told you don't fucking piss me off.

1:10:50.816 --> 1:10:53.189
- [Tonya] Get away from her!

1:10:53.190 --> 1:10:55.743
I called the police, they're on their way.

1:10:58.017 --> 1:11:02.307
- You know, you really should
of mind your damn business.

1:11:02.308 --> 1:11:03.140
(gun fires)

1:11:03.141 --> 1:11:04.808
- [Hazel] Floyd, no!

1:11:05.755 --> 1:11:06.755
Stop, Floyd!

1:11:09.746 --> 1:11:12.579
- [Tonya] I hope you burn in hell.

1:11:17.453 --> 1:11:19.786
(gun fires)

1:12:09.247 --> 1:12:11.414
- Police, is anybody home?

1:12:23.011 --> 1:12:26.011
(suspenseful music)

1:13:50.855 --> 1:13:52.605
- [Hazel] Get off me!

1:13:54.631 --> 1:13:55.464
Move!

1:13:56.736 --> 1:13:57.569
Move!

1:14:01.838 --> 1:14:03.946
(gun fires)

1:14:03.947 --> 1:14:04.779
- [Floyd] Give it to me, bitch!

1:14:04.780 --> 1:14:07.113
- No, get the fuck off!
- Give it to me!

1:14:07.114 --> 1:14:08.240
(gun fires)

1:14:08.241 --> 1:14:09.408
Give it to me!

1:14:16.394 --> 1:14:17.518
- [Hazel] Just stab him!

1:14:17.519 --> 1:14:19.310
Jennifer, stab him!

1:14:19.311 --> 1:14:20.729
Stab him!

1:14:20.730 --> 1:14:21.563
Stab him!

1:14:41.613 --> 1:14:43.120
You motherfucker.

1:14:43.121 --> 1:14:45.038
(sobs)

1:14:47.842 --> 1:14:48.992
- And that's for James!

1:14:52.960 --> 1:14:54.497
- We can still be a family.

1:14:57.253 --> 1:14:58.596
- Fuck you.

1:14:58.597 --> 1:14:59.514
Go to hell.

1:15:01.555 --> 1:15:03.722
(screams)

1:15:13.742 --> 1:15:16.659
(knuckles rapping)

1:15:19.620 --> 1:15:22.620
(suspenseful music)

1:15:25.950 --> 1:15:28.117
(screams)

1:15:37.792 --> 1:15:40.792
(adventurous music)
