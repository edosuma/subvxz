WEBVTT

00:38.039 --> 00:39.332
Damn...

00:40.875 --> 00:41.918
Oh, shit.

00:42.752 --> 00:43.753
OK...

00:47.549 --> 00:48.675
- Marius!
- Shh!

00:49.175 --> 00:50.051
What the fuck?

00:50.385 --> 00:52.428
- I'm here to save you.
- From who?

00:52.470 --> 00:53.763
I'll explain in the car.

00:54.430 --> 00:56.266
C'mon, if they see you,
they'll kill you--

00:56.349 --> 00:57.767
No, my family's in here.

00:57.892 --> 00:59.018
Pete... Pete...

00:59.519 --> 01:00.979
They'll kill your family too.

01:03.856 --> 01:04.774
Shit!

01:07.026 --> 01:07.944
Get in the back!

01:08.027 --> 01:09.279
- In the back?
- In the back!

01:15.368 --> 01:17.412
What the fuck is going on, Marius?

01:17.620 --> 01:19.289
A couple of days after I got out

01:19.414 --> 01:20.957
these two gorillas grabbed me
off the street.

01:20.999 --> 01:23.585
They threw me in their trunk
they kept asking me where my mum was.

01:24.002 --> 01:25.670
- Your mum?
- No, your mum.

01:26.004 --> 01:28.548
- They... they thought I was you.
- What? Why?

01:28.715 --> 01:31.509
I don't know. I kept telling them who I was,
but they didn't care!

01:31.759 --> 01:35.013
They said that if I didn't find your mum,
they would kill your whole family!

01:35.263 --> 01:36.514
Look, if my family's in danger

01:36.598 --> 01:38.016
- I gotta go back, I gotta warn them!
- No, no, no.

01:38.057 --> 01:41.019
They said that if I talked to anybody

01:41.227 --> 01:43.354
- they would kill your mother anyway.
- You told my...

01:43.438 --> 01:45.398
- My mum's dead!
- No, you sit down, get down, get down.

01:45.648 --> 01:47.025
- Get down!
- God damn it!

01:47.066 --> 01:48.276
You gotta stay down!

01:49.777 --> 01:51.863
Look, maybe I should
just go back to prison, man.

01:51.946 --> 01:53.615
You don't know the night that I've had.

01:53.698 --> 01:55.325
Pete, they were going to kill you
in prison.

01:55.575 --> 01:57.201
That's why I got you out.

01:57.994 --> 01:59.370
What? You got me out?

01:59.537 --> 02:02.040
I paid the C.O. on the bus
to leave you behind.

02:02.081 --> 02:04.375
He had to cover and say you escaped.

02:04.417 --> 02:06.836
That's why CERT and the Marshals
are looking for you.

02:06.919 --> 02:09.839
I was gonna meet you at the road,
but I couldn't shake them in time.

02:09.922 --> 02:11.716
How did you know
I was going back to the farm?

02:12.300 --> 02:13.885
Pete, we were cellies for three years.

02:13.968 --> 02:14.969
I didn't need to guess.

02:15.845 --> 02:18.348
Oh my God, this is fucking crazy, man.

02:18.640 --> 02:20.808
- This is absolutely crazy.
- No, you know what's crazy?

02:20.975 --> 02:22.310
Is the fact that all those years

02:22.393 --> 02:24.354
I thought you were an idiot
for robbing a gun range.

02:27.607 --> 02:28.858
What about the gun range?

02:28.941 --> 02:30.902
Oh. They know all about the gun range

02:30.985 --> 02:33.446
they know all about the storage place.
They know everything.

02:35.406 --> 02:37.283
How the fuck do they know
about the storage place?

02:37.325 --> 02:39.702
I don't know. But it's why
they're looking for you and your mother.

02:40.161 --> 02:42.330
What the fuck did you guys do?

02:42.622 --> 02:45.375
Pete, I can't help you... I can't help you
if you don't tell me what happened.

02:45.541 --> 02:47.335
- I can't!
- No, you gotta tell me what happened!

02:47.377 --> 02:49.253
If we don't do what these guys want,
we're all dead.

02:49.420 --> 02:51.547
You, me, your whole family.

02:51.631 --> 02:53.132
They're gonna burn down the farmhouse

02:53.299 --> 02:54.467
with everybody inside!

02:54.509 --> 02:56.469
What the fuck did you and your mother do?

03:00.223 --> 03:01.516
Oh, my God!

03:08.940 --> 03:11.317
So, eight years ago... OK...

03:13.611 --> 03:14.570
this guy Reggie

03:16.614 --> 03:18.324
<i>he gets me and my mum into this thing</i>

03:18.408 --> 03:19.742
<i>we called "housecleaning".</i>

03:22.787 --> 03:24.122
<i>We'd sit on a house</i>

03:25.081 --> 03:26.499
<i>wait for the people to leave</i>

03:26.791 --> 03:30.169
<i>and when the owners left,
I would follow them, you know.</i>

03:31.921 --> 03:33.589
<i>and Reggie, my mum and the crew</i>

03:33.756 --> 03:36.008
<i>would clean it the fuck out, man.</i>

03:40.179 --> 03:43.349
<i>They would take art,
they would take furniture</i>

03:43.433 --> 03:45.309
<i>they would take everything.</i>

03:47.061 --> 03:48.604
<i>Down to the fucking spoons!</i>

03:54.694 --> 03:56.112
<i>Then like three years ago</i>

03:56.279 --> 03:59.741
<i>we come up north,
we started hitting storage facilities.</i>

04:00.283 --> 04:02.535
<i>We'd scouted this one
in Mount Vernon.</i>

04:03.369 --> 04:06.956
<i>Every day, the guard went to the bench
and ate his lunch.</i>

04:08.040 --> 04:10.418
<i>And the day we hit it was no different.</i>

04:10.501 --> 04:12.170
<i>We knew we had one hour.</i>

04:12.336 --> 04:14.881
<i>If he started back early,
I was supposed to call.</i>

04:16.841 --> 04:18.259
<i>But then my mum calls me</i>

04:20.511 --> 04:22.096
<i>She tells me to stall him.</i>

04:23.264 --> 04:26.392
- OK.
<i>- She says do whatever it takes.</i>

04:33.357 --> 04:35.860
<i>I should have fucking shot him,
I could've...</i>

04:38.154 --> 04:41.908
<i>kidnapped him, run him over with my car
or something, but there were people.</i>

04:43.075 --> 04:45.036
<i>There were so many fucking people there.</i>

04:52.376 --> 04:55.838
<i>So then he goes into
this sporting goods store</i>

04:58.424 --> 05:00.301
<i>except it's not.</i>

05:01.636 --> 05:03.930
<i>It's a fucking gun range, man!</i>

05:05.723 --> 05:08.059
<i>But she said... she said
"do whatever it takes"</i>

05:11.479 --> 05:12.480
<i>And I knew what that meant.</i>

05:12.522 --> 05:14.148
<i>I knew if I didn't stop that guard</i>

05:16.108 --> 05:17.944
<i>then my mum and the guys could end up dead.</i>

05:34.710 --> 05:36.170
Nobody move!

05:36.212 --> 05:38.673
<i>When I got back in there,
the guard was gone.</i>

05:47.348 --> 05:49.058
It was just like I feared, man.

05:52.812 --> 05:55.231
He went back to the space
and everybody died.

05:55.898 --> 05:58.526
Yeah, but the news said
that two people escaped.

05:59.193 --> 06:00.570
A man and a woman.

06:01.070 --> 06:04.490
No, my mum and Reggie took bullets
in the shootout and they died on the run.

06:08.327 --> 06:09.912
Why did they think your
mother was still alive?

06:10.121 --> 06:11.789
I can't talk anymore.

06:12.582 --> 06:13.708
I gotta sleep.

07:05.509 --> 07:06.510
You alright?

07:06.552 --> 07:09.388
I'm sorry, I know it's early, Grandma,
I didn't want to wake you last night.

07:09.722 --> 07:10.640
Oh God

07:11.015 --> 07:12.642
they found the headlight, didn't they?

07:12.683 --> 07:13.559
<i>Not the light itself.</i>

07:13.601 --> 07:15.394
But there was a bag of something
in evidence

07:15.436 --> 07:17.396
that looked like it
could be headlight glass.

07:17.521 --> 07:18.439
I knew it--

07:18.564 --> 07:19.941
<i>Look, it's not a smoking gun</i>

07:20.358 --> 07:24.278
OK? But you need to get those headlights
replaced sooner than later

07:24.612 --> 07:25.738
Yeah, I'll do it first thing.

07:25.947 --> 07:27.490
Good. And remember--

07:27.657 --> 07:30.159
I know, I know. Used parts.

07:30.326 --> 07:32.578
Yeah. I'll call you later.
I love you, Grandma.

07:32.787 --> 07:33.871
I love you too.

07:58.646 --> 08:01.273
Man, look at this proclamation.

08:02.108 --> 08:03.567
Goddamn Easter Rebellion.

08:05.528 --> 08:07.780
- You know if it's real?
- Who are you?

08:08.990 --> 08:10.282
I'm a friend of Irish Moe's.

08:10.700 --> 08:12.618
- The fuck you are.
- You're him?

08:13.494 --> 08:14.870
I was expecting a fellow mick.

08:15.413 --> 08:18.165
- What're you, Pacific Islander?
- What do you want?

08:20.292 --> 08:22.044
I'm just gonna go in my pocket
and get my phone.

08:28.342 --> 08:30.678
<i>No, I'll miss you most of
all, scarecrow</i>

08:30.845 --> 08:32.847
<i>nothing that anybody can look back on.</i>

08:32.930 --> 08:34.932
<i>Look, I know how
to play my part.</i>

08:35.516 --> 08:38.811
<i>After you force me to open up the safe
you can't go straight for the cash box</i>

08:38.978 --> 08:40.646
You see, Moe, one of those voices I know.

08:41.897 --> 08:42.898
Guy's a pro

08:43.482 --> 08:44.942
very detail-orientated.

08:45.443 --> 08:46.777
Triple checks his weapons.

08:47.069 --> 08:49.321
Records his clients in case
a deal goes south.

08:50.239 --> 08:51.866
But he didn't check in
after this last gig

08:52.616 --> 08:53.701
which is not S.O.P.

08:54.076 --> 08:55.494
So I have to assume the worst.

08:55.953 --> 08:57.663
But I still need to know
what happened.

08:58.831 --> 09:00.374
I need to talk to that other voice.

09:00.958 --> 09:01.876
Who is he?

09:03.044 --> 09:04.587
- No idea.
- Give me a name.

09:05.212 --> 09:06.172
I'll get out of your hair.

09:23.647 --> 09:25.024
I'm looking for a headlight

09:25.274 --> 09:28.319
- for a 1987 GMC High Sierra--
- Sorry.

09:29.070 --> 09:29.945
Are you sure?

09:30.446 --> 09:32.323
You got an awful lot of metal out here.

09:32.823 --> 09:35.576
I know every item in this yard
and I know your truck.

09:35.826 --> 09:36.702
People hold on to them.

09:37.078 --> 09:39.455
Only place you're gonna
find parts for it is at Pep Boys.

09:39.622 --> 09:40.581
I see.

09:40.831 --> 09:42.541
The thing is, I want used parts.

09:42.792 --> 09:44.126
You know, to keep it authentic.

09:44.376 --> 09:46.045
Yeah, well, if you don't need 'em fast

09:46.128 --> 09:48.506
I can put an order into
the national database

09:48.547 --> 09:50.508
and see if anything comes in.

09:50.591 --> 09:51.509
Just need your name and number.

09:51.550 --> 09:55.638
Um, hm. You know, maybe I will
hit Pep Boys.

09:56.222 --> 09:57.139
Thanks.

10:00.976 --> 10:03.521
So, uh, the shoes

10:03.771 --> 10:05.106
The shoes are pretty scuffed up.

10:05.564 --> 10:07.691
Pattern in there suggests drag marks.

10:08.025 --> 10:11.195
My guess would be
a physical altercation with the killer.

10:12.947 --> 10:15.282
Might be why his shield is missing.
Dropped it in a fight.

10:16.033 --> 10:19.662
Maybe he dropped it
or maybe the killer took it as a trophy.

10:23.791 --> 10:26.877
Head wound came from the right,
chest from the left.

10:28.087 --> 10:28.963
Why?

10:31.048 --> 10:32.883
I don't... um...

10:34.969 --> 10:36.804
OK, OK... um...

10:37.847 --> 10:39.557
Killer and Winslow were in
the woods together.

10:40.891 --> 10:41.851
Maybe to make a deal.

10:42.601 --> 10:44.311
Maybe the Killer
took him out there for a hit.

10:46.105 --> 10:49.358
Either way, you know...
they... they argued

10:50.568 --> 10:53.070
Right? They scuffled

10:53.320 --> 10:55.906
Winslow decides to make a break for it

10:57.324 --> 10:59.910
gets in his car, takes off.

11:01.412 --> 11:04.540
Killer gets in his car, gives chase

11:05.666 --> 11:10.045
bashes Winslow from behind,
sends him just... right into a tree.

11:12.298 --> 11:13.340
So he sheers off right.

11:14.008 --> 11:15.009
Killer gets out...

11:16.886 --> 11:20.556
approaches passenger side,
puts a quick bullet in Winslow's temple

11:20.848 --> 11:21.807
to down him

11:23.184 --> 11:24.977
circles around to get closer

11:26.645 --> 11:28.480
puts two more in his chest
to finish the job.

11:32.234 --> 11:34.069
Let's walk through it at the car.

11:55.841 --> 11:56.884
Shit.

11:59.553 --> 12:01.347
- Julia?
- Oh, good.

12:01.722 --> 12:03.390
I thought you had that thing
at Ellen's school today.

12:03.641 --> 12:05.434
No, her recital's next week.

12:05.517 --> 12:06.727
And it'd be nice if you

12:06.810 --> 12:09.021
- and Grandpa could make it this time.
- Who's that?

12:10.022 --> 12:12.316
- Nobody.
- Valerie Abeyta?

12:12.650 --> 12:14.109
I already decided not to bond her out.

12:14.193 --> 12:16.362
The bail's half a million,
but she's too big a flight risk--

12:16.445 --> 12:17.363
Good.

12:18.155 --> 12:19.198
She ran on Eagle Bonding.

12:19.281 --> 12:21.575
And word is she's got
a foot in Mexico at all times.

12:21.992 --> 12:23.035
Julia, I trust you.

12:23.410 --> 12:24.328
Since when?

12:24.536 --> 12:25.746
Since you got us out of that mess

12:26.247 --> 12:27.456
I made with Dockery.

12:28.791 --> 12:30.292
I never really thanked you.

12:32.127 --> 12:33.170
Wow... um...

12:35.172 --> 12:36.298
You're welcome, Audrey.

12:37.549 --> 12:39.134
And it is really settled, right?

12:40.219 --> 12:42.221
Cos I heard you say something
about un-ringing a bell.

12:42.554 --> 12:44.014
Yes, it's settled.

12:44.515 --> 12:45.891
It's settled because I settled it.

12:48.185 --> 12:50.187
Just asking a simple question.

13:05.869 --> 13:07.746
Bobby, Audrey Bernhardt...

13:08.914 --> 13:10.165
Fine, fine. You?

13:13.085 --> 13:16.922
The reason I'm calling is...
I have a problem with my truck.

13:17.381 --> 13:20.301
Hey, Pete remember that thing
I didn't want to tell you about?

13:21.176 --> 13:23.429
I need to tell you about it.
Call me back.

13:27.182 --> 13:28.058
Hey.

13:29.310 --> 13:31.729
- I take it Grandma's inside?
- Whatever gives you that idea?

13:32.688 --> 13:35.190
Hey, I'm gonna hit the store
on the corner, you want anything?

13:35.482 --> 13:38.068
Oh, no, I'm good.
Hey, do you by any chance know if erm...

13:38.944 --> 13:40.112
cousin Pete left town?

13:40.487 --> 13:41.363
Why?

13:42.239 --> 13:43.324
This is gonna sound crazy

13:43.407 --> 13:47.494
but I thought I saw him outside
the farmhouse at, like 3am last night.

13:47.661 --> 13:50.164
He shoved some dude in a car
and then drove off.

13:50.581 --> 13:52.124
OK, I thought you stopped
smoking pot?

13:53.167 --> 13:55.419
- It helps me sleep.
- And there's your answer.

13:56.754 --> 13:57.963
Maybe I'll ask Grandma about it.

13:58.005 --> 14:01.592
Go ahead. Have fun explaining why you
were seeing shit out your window at 3am.

14:23.530 --> 14:26.367
- What was that?
- That was the ice machine, outside.

14:28.702 --> 14:29.870
Yeah...

14:30.579 --> 14:31.455
Jesus.

14:42.132 --> 14:43.926
This whole thing's so weird, man.

14:45.260 --> 14:46.929
Cos it's like, I'm, I'm, I'm out

14:47.721 --> 14:49.598
you know, but I'm not... like...

14:51.600 --> 14:52.518
I'm not free.

14:53.227 --> 14:55.854
Well, it's either this,
or getting shivved in the rec yard.

14:57.439 --> 14:58.315
Yeah.

14:59.483 --> 15:01.985
Listen, why don't you take a shower
and uh...

15:02.486 --> 15:04.613
and put on the clothes I brought you.

15:04.988 --> 15:06.490
Clear your mind for a little bit.

15:06.949 --> 15:08.659
I'm gonna go check the perimeter right?

15:20.796 --> 15:21.839
Is he awake?

15:27.678 --> 15:30.055
- Shower.
- No one in the family saw him, right?

15:30.639 --> 15:31.849
I got him out just in time.

15:32.182 --> 15:35.060
- OK, cos if any one of them sees Pete...
- I get burned

15:35.144 --> 15:36.603
I heard you the first twenty times.

15:37.938 --> 15:38.897
This is good.

15:39.273 --> 15:41.400
You're sure that he's lying
about his mother being dead?

15:41.525 --> 15:44.236
I spent three years in a cell
with this guy.

15:44.570 --> 15:46.405
I can read his tells like a comic book.

15:46.905 --> 15:47.781
Right, so now...

15:48.240 --> 15:50.993
So now we get him to tell us the truth.

16:25.986 --> 16:27.321
You were right, man.

16:27.571 --> 16:29.656
I forgot how good it is to take a shower

16:29.740 --> 16:32.326
without two dudes fucking
in the stall next to you.

16:32.367 --> 16:33.702
That's great. Hey, listen.

16:33.785 --> 16:36.079
You know, I'm gonna go meet with
these guys to try to reason with them.

16:36.788 --> 16:38.999
I mean, you said it yourself,
your mother's dead.

16:39.082 --> 16:41.668
It doesn't do them any good to, to keep
looking for her.

16:42.628 --> 16:44.421
Might as well lay our cards
on the table, right?

16:44.505 --> 16:46.131
No, can, can't you just call them?

16:46.632 --> 16:49.384
Well, if I call them, then they they're gonna
think that we're lying to protect her.

16:49.426 --> 16:50.761
If they see my face

16:51.220 --> 16:52.471
then they'll know that, uh...

16:53.347 --> 16:54.431
that I'm telling the truth.

16:56.266 --> 16:57.935
- Right?
- I... I don't know, man, I...

16:58.060 --> 17:00.145
I think that that's too fucking dangerous.

17:01.021 --> 17:04.274
Well, if I'm not back in a few hours, then,
uh, we'll know for sure.

17:05.817 --> 17:07.027
Shoot.

17:08.654 --> 17:09.821
Oh, fuck.

17:09.905 --> 17:11.573
That's them. I gotta go.

17:11.740 --> 17:12.699
Oh!

17:13.367 --> 17:15.869
- What's that about?
- That's for saving my life, man.

17:19.456 --> 17:22.543
- Oh, you'd do the same for me.
- Yeah, you bet.

17:23.752 --> 17:25.796
Hey, listen... if, if you get hungry
while I'm gone

17:25.879 --> 17:27.422
there's a pizza place across the street.

17:27.506 --> 17:29.591
The delivery number is in the window.

17:29.883 --> 17:31.885
It's it's, uh, it's right next to the bar.

17:32.219 --> 17:33.345
You can't miss it.

17:59.246 --> 18:01.832
- Hey, Julia. Who's your friend?
- Oh, hey, Pete. This is Frank.

18:01.873 --> 18:03.500
He's looking to rent an office
in the neighbourhood.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.419
- Frank, my cousin Pete.
- Nice to meet you, Pete.

18:05.502 --> 18:07.629
- You want to rent in the neighbourhood?
- Yeah, thinking about

18:07.796 --> 18:09.214
you know, a little storefront office.

18:09.298 --> 18:10.424
Oh, what do you do for work?

18:10.674 --> 18:13.760
- Uh, kind of a private investigator.
- Oh, you're a P.I. really?

18:14.720 --> 18:15.846
What kind of cases do you handle?

18:16.305 --> 18:20.017
It varies. These days,
I spend a lot of time watching people.

18:20.809 --> 18:22.769
Making sure they don't go
where they're not supposed to.

18:23.478 --> 18:24.438
Like cheaters?

18:24.855 --> 18:26.189
Yeah, you could say that.

18:26.440 --> 18:27.899
Sure could've used you ten months ago.

18:28.066 --> 18:30.027
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

18:30.235 --> 18:32.029
- That's a different story.
- Mm-hm.

18:32.321 --> 18:33.572
It's nice to meet you, Frank.

18:33.697 --> 18:35.657
- Nice to meet you, Pete.
- Hey, Julia, can I talk to you

18:35.741 --> 18:37.701
- inside really quickly?
- Uh, yeah, sure. Alright.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.119
Uh, nice to meet you, Frank. Bye.

18:39.953 --> 18:41.204
Why, what's going on?
What is it?

18:42.789 --> 18:43.957
Just stay away from that guy.

18:44.082 --> 18:46.126
- You met him for like two seconds.
- Trust me.

18:46.251 --> 18:47.127
He's bad news.

18:47.210 --> 18:49.129
- Do you hear how paranoid you--
- Hey. Listen to me.

18:51.590 --> 18:52.883
Stay away from him.

18:54.801 --> 18:55.677
OK.

18:58.013 --> 18:59.306
I need some water.

19:02.643 --> 19:04.186
- Hey.
- What?

19:04.561 --> 19:06.897
Did you go by the farmhouse, last night?

19:07.648 --> 19:08.523
What?

19:10.275 --> 19:11.151
No.

19:13.487 --> 19:16.531
Carly thinks she saw you
pushing somebody into the back of a car.

19:18.283 --> 19:21.787
But it was 3am
and she smokes pot to sleep so...

19:22.496 --> 19:26.625
So, um, you, you called me
because you needed help with something?

19:27.209 --> 19:28.502
I do.

19:30.212 --> 19:31.546
Promise you won't yell at me.

19:31.755 --> 19:32.798
Already sounds good.

19:33.507 --> 19:36.051
In order to keep Lance
out of an early grave

19:37.386 --> 19:38.970
I agreed to...

19:39.721 --> 19:43.058
launder some money for Dockery.

19:43.350 --> 19:44.226
What?

19:46.395 --> 19:48.605
So you thought
because I'm your shady cousin

19:48.980 --> 19:50.023
I might have some ideas for you?

19:50.941 --> 19:52.067
- Do you?
- I might.

19:54.569 --> 19:55.487
But, uh...

19:56.613 --> 19:57.781
here's the thing.

19:59.491 --> 20:01.618
I need your help with something
that I need to do

20:01.702 --> 20:04.621
and then I'll help you figure out how to
launder the money for Dockery.

20:05.455 --> 20:06.873
- OK?
- Well...

20:06.957 --> 20:08.458
It kind of depends
on what your thing is.

20:09.251 --> 20:11.628
It's just I'm freelancing
for insurance fraud.

20:12.003 --> 20:13.755
It's this guy, he says his mother's dead.

20:14.214 --> 20:17.050
Uh, he's trying to get the pay-out.
The company thinks he's full of shit.

20:17.217 --> 20:18.719
So I'm trying to run something

20:19.428 --> 20:21.388
- to get him to spill and I just--
- Is it illegal?

20:22.055 --> 20:23.306
No, of course not.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.976
So rear collider wasn't a car.
It's higher.

20:26.435 --> 20:27.978
Truck, SUV.

20:29.563 --> 20:31.356
Some of it could have been previous damage.

20:32.441 --> 20:33.400
There'd be rust.

20:35.235 --> 20:37.738
Well, it was grey, whatever it was.

20:38.697 --> 20:41.324
I'll have Crime Scene get a sample of that.

20:41.491 --> 20:43.118
OK, so according to your theory

20:43.410 --> 20:45.996
killer hits the car, goes off right.

20:46.705 --> 20:47.706
Killer gets out.

20:48.290 --> 20:51.209
Goes to the nearest window.
Passenger side.

20:52.210 --> 20:53.503
Fires the first shot.

20:54.421 --> 20:55.881
- Huh.
- What?

20:56.590 --> 20:58.842
Angle on the entry, Winslow's temple was...

20:59.301 --> 21:00.177
was low.

21:00.677 --> 21:02.471
The shot would have had to come
from near the ground.

21:03.472 --> 21:04.681
Bullet would have hit the door.

21:05.182 --> 21:08.769
Unless Winslow's head was cocked
to the left after impact.

21:12.939 --> 21:13.940
Be the shooter.

21:17.861 --> 21:18.862
Sure.

21:23.700 --> 21:26.745
It's after impact.
Car hits the tree, comes to a stop.

21:29.956 --> 21:30.957
Bang.

21:32.042 --> 21:33.585
Shooter goes around for the double tap.

21:48.016 --> 21:49.017
Bang, bang!

21:56.233 --> 21:57.692
You know, your theory pans out.
I'll, um...

21:59.611 --> 22:01.655
- I'll finish my report with it.
- Great.

22:05.116 --> 22:06.117
Wait a minute.

22:09.496 --> 22:10.455
What?

22:12.082 --> 22:13.500
- What is it?
- Does that look like blood to you?

22:20.715 --> 22:23.009
- Hmm. It's hard to tell.
- No.

22:24.010 --> 22:27.055
It definitely is. All of Winslow's splatter
is on the driver's side.

22:27.138 --> 22:28.265
This is nowhere near it.

22:29.432 --> 22:31.810
I'll have Crime Scene take a sample
of that too.

22:37.190 --> 22:38.650
I knew I wasn't seeing things.

22:39.901 --> 22:41.319
So, I mean, who... who was he?

22:41.403 --> 22:43.446
Well, he's just a buddy of mine.
He's been in recovery.

22:44.072 --> 22:45.574
Like a, a drug addict?

22:45.657 --> 22:47.993
Well, no, he's been
clean for a while now.

22:48.243 --> 22:49.786
But, uh, he's been having a rough time.

22:49.870 --> 22:51.329
And last night, he really felt the urge

22:51.371 --> 22:53.582
so to his credit, he called me.

22:54.291 --> 22:56.751
I didn't pick up the phone
and then he came to the farm

22:56.877 --> 22:58.378
thinking that I was still there.

22:58.712 --> 23:00.714
So what, what are you,
like his sponsor or something?

23:01.214 --> 23:03.800
Uh, uh, well, we're friends.

23:04.301 --> 23:06.177
You know, friends look out for friends.

23:06.928 --> 23:08.013
So where is he now?

23:08.722 --> 23:10.557
He's at home.
We talked for a bit. He's fine.

23:11.600 --> 23:13.143
- Sounds rough.
- Yeah.

23:13.518 --> 23:15.228
I bet he could get
some good stuff though, right?

23:16.104 --> 23:16.980
What?

23:17.314 --> 23:18.523
Totally joking.

23:18.940 --> 23:20.775
- Oh, like you want to smoke some crack.
- Yeah, no, yeah.

23:22.444 --> 23:24.362
- No, I'm, I'm sorry about your friend.
- Oh, it's funny.

23:24.446 --> 23:25.989
- No, it's fine, thank you.
- Yeah, no, I'm sorry, really--

23:26.072 --> 23:29.492
If it's OK, would you mind just keeping
this between the two of us?

23:30.201 --> 23:31.912
- Done.
- Thank you.

23:33.413 --> 23:34.456
Yeah, thank you, um.

23:35.790 --> 23:38.752
I mean, for,
for being the one family member

23:38.835 --> 23:41.212
who's always straight with me.

23:43.006 --> 23:44.132
You're welcome.

23:46.259 --> 23:50.430
- OK. Oh, my God. I am so sorry.
- No, don't worry about it.

23:50.597 --> 23:52.432
I better get out of here
before I destroy your car.

23:52.515 --> 23:53.683
It's a piece of shit. It's alright.

23:53.767 --> 23:54.726
It's already destroyed.

24:13.078 --> 24:15.038
<i>Yeah, number 15, your order's ready.</i>

24:15.246 --> 24:18.458
<i>- Two chili cheeseburgers</i>
- Oh, I'm sorry sweetheart..

24:18.583 --> 24:20.001
- Oh, my God.
- What?

24:20.585 --> 24:22.295
You look exactly like my sister.

24:22.629 --> 24:23.630
What? Uh, OK.

24:23.880 --> 24:26.549
- Can I get a picture of us together?
- Uh, that's not weird.

24:26.675 --> 24:27.592
Yeah, I know. But it'd be like

24:27.676 --> 24:28.802
- looking in a mirror.
- Jesus.

24:29.219 --> 24:31.513
You know? She's gonna love it.

24:32.722 --> 24:35.100
- Thanks, sweetheart.
- Uh, no prob.

24:43.149 --> 24:46.152
- So, um, is it working or not?
- Hold on. It's still connecting.

24:54.953 --> 24:55.954
Hello, oh.

24:57.080 --> 24:58.248
So you think your cousin is lying?

24:59.541 --> 25:01.835
Uh, that's what I want to find out.

25:50.133 --> 25:51.259
What's the best beer you got?

25:51.634 --> 25:55.930
I like Twin Pines Pineapple Porter,
Porkfat's Double IPA

25:56.264 --> 25:57.640
Just give me a Red Stripe.

26:02.854 --> 26:03.730
Glass?

26:08.068 --> 26:08.985
Guess not.

26:13.615 --> 26:14.699
Hit me again.

26:17.619 --> 26:19.120
Well, I don't care what you think.

26:19.204 --> 26:20.455
No, you're not going.

26:20.497 --> 26:22.582
Well, you should have thought
about that before you...

26:24.459 --> 26:26.503
No, missy, you are not going.

26:26.795 --> 26:28.880
Because I'm your mother and I said so.

26:31.841 --> 26:35.553
Oh! I'm sorry. My daughter.

26:36.137 --> 26:38.807
She's having a hard time accepting
what "being grounded" means.

26:39.390 --> 26:40.266
It's none of my business.

26:40.558 --> 26:41.476
You have kids?

26:42.185 --> 26:43.061
Oh...

26:44.687 --> 26:46.564
None that I'm aware of.

26:47.398 --> 26:48.817
Don't get me wrong, I love my daughter.

26:48.900 --> 26:50.443
There are just times, you know

26:51.611 --> 26:52.737
I want to strangle her.

26:53.321 --> 26:54.364
I bet.

26:58.952 --> 27:00.495
And don't even get me started

27:00.662 --> 27:02.747
on the 12 grand that I spent fixing these

27:02.831 --> 27:04.290
after she was done with them.

27:04.916 --> 27:07.961
But you know the truth is, they're even
better now than they were before, so.

27:08.419 --> 27:10.964
- That's money well spent.
- Right?

27:11.673 --> 27:12.882
Yeah.

27:13.550 --> 27:14.425
Thank you.

27:15.802 --> 27:16.886
Mister?

27:18.888 --> 27:19.764
Pete.

27:20.807 --> 27:21.891
Hmm. Well.

27:23.601 --> 27:24.644
Thank you, Mr Pete.

27:30.191 --> 27:31.151
Hey, um...

27:33.153 --> 27:34.404
would you like another drink?

27:39.284 --> 27:40.994
I'd love one.

27:42.120 --> 27:43.705
Hey, uh, can we get the lady

27:43.830 --> 27:46.332
- another drink, please?
- Yeah, sure thing.

27:51.880 --> 27:52.922
Hi.

27:53.882 --> 27:56.384
- How old's your daughter?
- Oh, she's 14.

27:56.509 --> 27:57.969
- No way.
- Way.

27:58.052 --> 28:00.054
<i>No, you're not old enough
to have a teenager.</i>

28:00.138 --> 28:02.807
<i>Ha! Listen to you, Mister Charming.</i>

28:03.725 --> 28:05.351
<i>No, I was pretty young when I had her.</i>

28:06.186 --> 28:08.688
<i>You know, that's probably why
she gets into this much trouble.</i>

28:09.480 --> 28:10.815
<i>She's like her mum.</i>

28:40.553 --> 28:42.096
Welcome back, sunshine.

28:45.600 --> 28:46.643
Come on.

28:47.352 --> 28:48.603
We're both better than that.

28:50.647 --> 28:51.773
Sorry about your jaw.

28:52.232 --> 28:53.316
I didn't mean to do that.

28:54.275 --> 28:56.152
But, hey, it happens, right?

28:58.738 --> 29:00.073
At least your hand's OK.

29:03.785 --> 29:04.911
Write down the name.

29:05.912 --> 29:07.372
No need to get ugly this time.

29:19.717 --> 29:21.052
Ugly it is.

29:41.698 --> 29:43.283
Let's try this again.

29:44.075 --> 29:46.244
- Hello?
- I... I thought he was gonna puke.

29:46.744 --> 29:48.830
Yeah, I need to change
your friend's bandages.

29:49.497 --> 29:51.416
It's not gonna be pretty.
You might want to leave the room.

29:51.582 --> 29:53.251
Oh, that's OK. I'll stay.

29:53.334 --> 29:55.295
Like I said, you might want
to leave the room.

29:57.005 --> 29:57.880
Fair enough.

30:22.488 --> 30:23.406
Oh.

30:26.868 --> 30:27.744
Bobby.

30:29.078 --> 30:30.371
Please tell me you got good news.

30:30.496 --> 30:33.249
I do. Can you meet me at the garage at 6?

30:34.042 --> 30:36.294
Yeah, I'll be there at 5:45

30:44.052 --> 30:45.595
Moe Soloman's room, please.

30:47.013 --> 30:48.514
It's 205, it's right there.

30:49.057 --> 30:50.141
Thank you.

31:02.820 --> 31:03.946
Right?

31:04.030 --> 31:05.406
You know how mothers are.

31:05.907 --> 31:07.075
Yeah.

31:07.784 --> 31:10.411
- My mum...
- Yeah?

31:10.578 --> 31:13.706
- Was she strict?
- No, no. No, she didn't have to be.

31:13.998 --> 31:15.625
No, she was born with the caul.

31:16.167 --> 31:18.836
<i>So she knew what I was gonna do
before even I did.</i>

31:20.046 --> 31:21.631
I remember my mum, it was the same thing.

31:21.798 --> 31:24.217
I would just be thinking about sneaking out,
and there she'd be.

31:25.009 --> 31:28.805
Marjorie, he said, "Born with the caul."
Ask him if she was a psychic.

31:29.097 --> 31:32.308
You know, sometimes, I would even think
that my mum was psychic.

31:32.683 --> 31:33.851
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

31:35.269 --> 31:37.355
- Was she?
- Well, no.

31:39.315 --> 31:40.358
What?

31:40.775 --> 31:42.360
Wait, what?

31:42.652 --> 31:45.279
- Was your mum psychic? No!
- Look, I know a lot of people think

31:45.363 --> 31:46.697
that it's bullshit, but yeah.

31:47.448 --> 31:48.491
No, she was.

31:49.117 --> 31:50.701
It was spooky how much she knew.

31:51.077 --> 31:53.287
I didn't get away with none
of the stuff my friends did

31:53.371 --> 31:54.497
none of it, none of it.

31:54.831 --> 31:56.541
<i>Was kind of a buzzkill for your childhood.</i>

31:56.791 --> 31:59.377
<i>No, no, no, no,
my childhood was great, yeah.</i>

32:00.128 --> 32:04.382
Grandparents, cousins lived out
on this farmhouse out in the countryside.

32:04.799 --> 32:07.385
- But, um...
- What?

32:11.639 --> 32:14.058
My dad was killed when I was little.

32:16.936 --> 32:19.689
So my mum, she was always looking
for another Dad, you know?

32:21.023 --> 32:23.693
- Trying to find me a, a role model.
- Mm.

32:25.653 --> 32:27.822
So these guys, oh, my God

32:28.906 --> 32:31.117
they weren't exactly solid citizens.

32:32.869 --> 32:34.829
<i>Right.</i>

32:35.037 --> 32:37.999
- So we, you know, we travelled around a lot.
- Yeah, where did you travel?

32:39.750 --> 32:41.586
No, dude, there was this one guy, Reggie

32:43.629 --> 32:45.381
he was into some heavy shit.

32:47.425 --> 32:49.469
We bounced all over the
country like rabbits.

32:50.970 --> 32:52.138
<i>Close it, Marjorie.</i>

32:53.473 --> 32:54.640
Really love my mum.

32:55.308 --> 32:56.225
That's sweet.

32:57.435 --> 32:58.394
Where is she now?

32:59.812 --> 33:00.730
She's dead.

33:02.940 --> 33:06.611
Yeah? You just said you love your mum,
not that you loved her.

33:07.153 --> 33:08.654
No, she's... she's dead.

33:10.239 --> 33:11.574
Eh, you don't seem too sure.

33:12.450 --> 33:14.494
- I'm pretty sure I'm sure.
- Yeah?

33:14.660 --> 33:17.121
- You sure? Come on, Pete.
- Yeah...

33:17.413 --> 33:18.498
- Yeah?
- Just tell me the truth.

33:23.211 --> 33:24.212
Just tell me the truth.

33:32.637 --> 33:33.804
I gotta meet a friend.

33:34.222 --> 33:35.097
Who, Marius?

33:36.891 --> 33:38.309
What the fuck is going on?

33:38.559 --> 33:40.228
It's real simple, Pete.

33:44.440 --> 33:45.733
Your mum is alive.

33:46.400 --> 33:47.902
And you're gonna tell me where she is.

33:48.236 --> 33:50.530
- I ain't telling you shit, lady.
- Oh, sure you are.

33:51.030 --> 33:52.657
Because we got your friend, Marius.

33:53.366 --> 33:54.450
Unless you talk

33:55.326 --> 33:56.536
he's a dead man.

34:27.441 --> 34:28.401
Hey.

34:29.402 --> 34:31.153
Prelim lab report came back
on the blood smudge

34:31.237 --> 34:32.405
that we found on the dashboard.

34:32.488 --> 34:33.698
- Hm?
- AB Negative.

34:34.031 --> 34:36.325
- OK, what was Winslow?
- O Positive.

34:37.076 --> 34:38.869
Looks like someone was in the car
with him when it crashed.

34:39.453 --> 34:41.581
I want to check out the crime scene
first thing tomorrow.

34:41.998 --> 34:43.583
- I'll bring coffee.
- Alright.

34:57.763 --> 34:59.223
Grandma, call me as soon as you can.

34:59.890 --> 35:01.058
I need to know your blood type.

35:02.852 --> 35:06.105
OK, there they are,
on the red one in the driveway.

35:06.689 --> 35:07.857
But they're still on the truck.

35:08.357 --> 35:09.233
Right.

35:11.319 --> 35:13.487
I won't steal headlights
off someone else's truck.

35:14.030 --> 35:15.406
I asked you for replacements.

35:15.906 --> 35:17.283
These are all I could track down.

35:17.491 --> 35:19.744
I told you, used parts
for the Sierra are hard to find.

35:20.536 --> 35:21.579
Then you go take 'em off.

35:21.704 --> 35:24.165
Look, I can loan you the tools,
but I'm not getting out of the truck.

35:27.501 --> 35:28.544
As I recall...

35:30.004 --> 35:32.048
we bailed you out on 3/4 collateral

35:32.214 --> 35:34.508
so you wouldn't miss your
daughter's birthday party.

35:35.176 --> 35:36.385
I know, I...

35:37.428 --> 35:38.679
Audrey, I did my time.

35:39.722 --> 35:43.267
Would you really ask me to risk everything
I've built since then for some headlights?

35:46.771 --> 35:47.938
I'm sorry, Bobby.

35:49.607 --> 35:51.067
Just drive.

36:03.162 --> 36:04.330
Oh, Jesus, Marius!

36:04.372 --> 36:06.248
I'm sorry, Pete.

36:06.374 --> 36:08.417
I tried to tell them
that Maggie was dead

36:08.793 --> 36:09.919
Shut the fuck up!

36:10.002 --> 36:12.213
- Oh! Oh, my balls!
- Oh, fuck.

36:15.549 --> 36:17.843
- What's our safe word?
- Ow.

36:21.555 --> 36:24.433
So, how do I launder $150,000?

36:24.642 --> 36:25.768
Right, uh, laundering money.

36:25.851 --> 36:30.481
You, you basically take something worthless
and you, uh, give it value.

36:30.648 --> 36:33.275
- Such as?
- Well, say you... you go to a thrift store

36:33.359 --> 36:37.488
you buy a bunch of cheap clothes
and then you sell them uh, for a lot more

36:37.697 --> 36:42.368
or you say you did, then you're basically
giving the money a story.

36:42.785 --> 36:44.286
You're... then... then it's clean.

36:44.412 --> 36:45.663
I like that.

36:46.122 --> 36:47.415
But that'd take a lot of clothing.

36:47.665 --> 36:51.711
Well, no, not clothing, you take.
Audrey's worthless properties

36:51.794 --> 36:52.837
Hey, hold on Audrey?

36:53.921 --> 36:54.922
OK, that's really tight.

36:55.297 --> 36:56.549
Well, you want it to look real.

36:56.966 --> 36:58.217
So what do I do with the properties?

37:00.553 --> 37:02.763
You, uh... you sell them to Dockery.

37:03.139 --> 37:06.475
- Who does he sell them to?
- Lance.

37:07.059 --> 37:08.144
Lance?

37:09.145 --> 37:11.772
- Where is she?
- I already told you, she's dead!

37:11.856 --> 37:14.191
No, they know!
And they have information!

37:14.275 --> 37:16.360
They know you're lying!
Please, I don't want to die!

37:16.444 --> 37:17.945
- I don't want to die!
- Five seconds

37:18.195 --> 37:20.030
and his brains are all over this truck.

37:20.698 --> 37:22.116
- Five
- She's in Sedona!

37:25.286 --> 37:26.954
I swear to God, that's all I know.

37:27.580 --> 37:30.416
The last time I talked to her,
she said she was in Sedona.

37:30.624 --> 37:34.044
And she made me promise
that if anyone asked to say she was dead.

37:34.503 --> 37:36.756
Another promise I couldn't keep!

37:38.257 --> 37:41.343
- Oh, fuck!
- Give me your fucking car keys!

37:41.677 --> 37:43.012
- Hell yeah, Marius!
- You son of a bitch!

37:43.345 --> 37:45.264
- Sit down! Sit down in the fucking chair!
- Yeah.

37:47.475 --> 37:48.851
Get going!

38:04.658 --> 38:06.243
Alright, you gotta lay low.

38:06.368 --> 38:09.371
I'm gonna go get some supplies
and figure out an exit strategy.

38:09.455 --> 38:13.417
- I'm so fucking sorry for all of this.
- No, just, just stay in your room this time.

38:13.751 --> 38:15.419
Alright? Here, take that.

38:15.836 --> 38:16.879
In case you need to reach me

38:17.004 --> 38:19.006
- I'm the first up on the speed dial.
- OK.

38:19.840 --> 38:21.300
Go, go.

38:45.825 --> 38:47.618
- Did you see which room he went into?
- No.

38:47.701 --> 38:50.246
- Who is he?
- I'm not 100%.

38:51.038 --> 38:52.748
But I think I've seen his face before.

38:52.998 --> 38:53.999
Where?

38:55.292 --> 38:56.627
At the police station.

38:57.211 --> 38:58.629
On my brother's computer.

38:59.797 --> 39:01.882
Hey, Sam. It's Otto.

39:02.299 --> 39:03.634
Moe's in the hospital.

39:04.009 --> 39:06.303
I tried to get in to see him, but they said
he's out for the night.

39:06.846 --> 39:07.847
Look, uh...

39:08.681 --> 39:10.307
call me as soon as you can.

39:11.267 --> 39:13.602
I... I got a bad feeling.

39:14.520 --> 39:15.437
Hello there.

39:16.856 --> 39:17.731
Hi.

39:18.649 --> 39:19.567
Do I know you?

39:22.695 --> 39:26.699
Oh look, son, take it easy.

39:26.949 --> 39:30.202
If you want this shitty car that bad,
you can have it.

39:30.619 --> 39:32.288
No, this isn't the car I'm looking for.

39:33.831 --> 39:35.374
You hired a house painter, yes?

39:36.417 --> 39:38.210
You only said a few words
to that nurse back there

39:38.294 --> 39:40.296
but you have a very distinct voice.

39:41.046 --> 39:42.965
<i>Look, I know how to play my part.</i>

39:44.425 --> 39:47.720
<i>After you force me to open up the safe,
you can't go straight for the cash box.</i>

39:47.845 --> 39:49.513
<i>You gotta grab some of the other shit too.</i>

39:50.890 --> 39:52.641
- Is that you?
- It is.

39:56.478 --> 39:57.354
Is he dead?

39:58.606 --> 39:59.607
Uh-huh.

40:02.276 --> 40:03.319
Where's his car?

40:03.861 --> 40:05.529
Look, look, I-I don't...

40:06.322 --> 40:09.450
Where is my father's fucking car?

40:15.623 --> 40:17.625
Are you out of your fucking mind?

40:20.085 --> 40:21.003
Sam?

40:23.339 --> 40:24.298
What the hell?

40:25.549 --> 40:28.928
You can't go in there.

40:50.157 --> 40:52.952
Sean hired me to follow her.

40:54.244 --> 40:55.829
If you go in there

40:56.664 --> 40:58.207
I'm gonna have to tell Sean

40:58.457 --> 41:01.919
because like it or not, he's my boss.

41:05.756 --> 41:06.757
Hey, Houdini.

41:06.966 --> 41:07.841
How'd it go?

41:07.925 --> 41:11.095
Well, I just got the feeling
back in my fingers.

41:11.136 --> 41:12.638
Find out if the guy's mum is still alive?

41:12.846 --> 41:14.765
Well, he, he doesn't know where she is

41:14.848 --> 41:16.475
so we can't prove anything.

41:16.517 --> 41:17.893
But, but thank you.

41:18.769 --> 41:20.938
Uh, I'm sure that was weird.

41:20.980 --> 41:23.607
Really? Tying up your cousin,
what's weird about that?

41:23.691 --> 41:26.944
Yeah, did you... did you talk to Lance?

41:27.653 --> 41:28.779
I tried.

41:29.113 --> 41:29.989
He's gone.

41:30.239 --> 41:33.033
<i>- What?</i>
- Yeah, his office is empty, his house.

41:33.075 --> 41:34.868
- Where is he?
<i>- I don't know, but...</i>

41:35.327 --> 41:36.704
I'm a skip tracer.

41:36.996 --> 41:38.288
I'll find him.

41:38.622 --> 41:41.834
Hey, did you ever... did you ever
try to find my mum?

41:42.543 --> 41:45.212
<i>- Huh?</i>
- I know the, the whole estrangement thing

41:45.295 --> 41:47.381
but did you ever...
did you ever try to find her?

41:48.924 --> 41:53.303
OK, what I'm about to say,
you have to promise never to tell Audrey.

41:53.971 --> 41:55.889
- Yeah, OK.
<i>- You do, I'll tie you up again</i>

41:56.015 --> 41:57.141
<i>and there will be no safe word.</i>

41:57.307 --> 41:58.559
I cross my heart.

42:00.019 --> 42:01.645
After Grandpa's stroke, I thought...

42:02.146 --> 42:03.439
your mum should know about it.

42:03.689 --> 42:05.315
So I asked Sam to find her.

42:06.483 --> 42:08.861
<i>He was able to track
her down to Sedona.</i>

42:09.403 --> 42:11.822
<i>But by the time I called the number,
the phone was disconnected.</i>

42:12.990 --> 42:15.325
He was able to put her on a plane
to Buffalo, but...

42:15.576 --> 42:16.493
then that was it.

42:17.453 --> 42:18.412
Buffalo?

42:21.498 --> 42:22.833
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:23.208 --> 42:26.795
No, I just want the whole package,
DHS, TSA, the whole thing.

42:27.171 --> 42:28.047
How soon can it be?

42:29.173 --> 42:31.967
Yeah, that's great. Look,
I'm depending on you. You're my rip cord.

42:32.634 --> 42:33.677
Alright. Bye.

42:33.927 --> 42:36.305
- Marius?
- I thought we failed.

42:36.722 --> 42:38.974
But we know Pete's mum isn't in Sedona,
but I just spoke to Julia.

42:39.058 --> 42:40.851
Pete told you in the bar
his mum's psychic, right?

42:40.976 --> 42:44.480
Sedona, Cassadaga, New Orleans,
those are all spiritualist centres.

42:44.563 --> 42:45.939
Marius, I have something to tell you.

42:46.231 --> 42:49.151
So Julia said that Sam tracked
her to Buffalo.

42:49.568 --> 42:52.112
What spiritualist centre is
the hot spot for Buffalo?

42:52.237 --> 42:53.781
- You need to listen to me.
- Rosedale.

42:55.657 --> 42:57.951
I, I'm, there's no guarantees,
but that's all I got for right now

42:58.118 --> 43:00.496
- and a leopard doesn't--
- Marius, can you just shut the fuck up?

43:01.830 --> 43:03.665
I know who the money belongs to.

43:04.625 --> 43:07.002
- Who?
- The owner of the storage facility.

43:11.757 --> 43:13.092
"Luka Delchev"?

43:13.342 --> 43:15.094
- You don't know who that is?
- Should I?

43:16.261 --> 43:17.554
You remember Billy Primo?

43:17.763 --> 43:18.972
Uh, yeah, of course.

43:19.473 --> 43:21.308
He tried to get me
into something, but I couldn't do it.

43:21.350 --> 43:23.727
Yeah? Well, Billy disappeared
five years ago

43:24.144 --> 43:27.439
right after Luka found out that Billy
pulled the Jamaican Switch on his niece

43:27.606 --> 43:28.857
got ten grand out of her.

43:29.108 --> 43:32.152
Billy tried to run,
but you don't run from Luka Delchev.

43:33.362 --> 43:35.197
And when they found Billy's body

43:36.365 --> 43:37.282
he had no teeth

43:38.033 --> 43:39.076
no gums

43:40.035 --> 43:40.994
no mouth.

43:41.036 --> 43:43.288
- What, what does that even mean, "no mouth"?
- It means

43:43.539 --> 43:45.624
that Luka made Billy drink acid

43:46.416 --> 43:47.876
over $10,000.

43:48.544 --> 43:50.838
What do you think he's gonna do to us
over 11 million?

43:56.927 --> 43:57.886
Marjorie...

43:59.429 --> 44:00.848
we're gonna do this right.

44:01.181 --> 44:05.102
There is no way I'm going
anywhere near Luka Delchev.

44:05.811 --> 44:07.479
Neither should Adam or Nicole.

44:08.230 --> 44:10.399
- Marjorie, look, listen...
- I'm out.

44:20.450 --> 44:21.535
You should be too.

44:37.676 --> 44:38.802
Pizza!

44:41.930 --> 44:43.765
Sorry. Uh, wrong room.
