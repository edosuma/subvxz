[birds chirping]

00:10.510 --> 00:13.138
[Jaiya] Any areas of your body
you don't want me to touch?

00:13.221 --> 00:14.180
Um…

00:14.264 --> 00:17.100
-My butt. No butt.
-Butt is off-limits. No butt.

00:17.183 --> 00:20.437
I wanna address before we get
on the table that your arousal is okay,

00:20.520 --> 00:23.606
and if you get an erection
during this, that is okay.

00:23.690 --> 00:24.524
Okay.

00:24.607 --> 00:26.735
You have total permission
to have an erection.

00:26.818 --> 00:29.237
-If it happens, we're all good.
-[Damon laughs]

00:29.320 --> 00:31.698
So you're gonna undress
as much as you're comfortable,

00:31.781 --> 00:33.700
and then you start face down on the table.

00:33.783 --> 00:34.826
[Damon] All right, okay.

00:36.619 --> 00:41.708
["Swan Lake (A Cappella)"
by Paul Sandrone playing]

01:01.978 --> 01:04.564
Culturally, we don't see a lot of models

01:04.647 --> 01:09.569
for how true communication,
vulnerable, honest communication happens

01:09.652 --> 01:13.031
between couples talking
about sex, thinking about sex.

01:13.114 --> 01:15.325
Everybody's always
putting on a face of, like,

01:15.408 --> 01:17.452
"We're really great," at the dinner party.

01:17.535 --> 01:19.621
-It's just not the case, you know?
-[woman] Right.

01:19.704 --> 01:21.623
There's always stuff going on.

01:21.706 --> 01:24.167
I've just recently
read an article that said

01:24.250 --> 01:26.628
we should stop saying
that we're happily married.

01:26.711 --> 01:30.131
Like, it doesn't do anybody
any service to just say that.

01:30.215 --> 01:31.758
That there's other parts to it,

01:31.841 --> 01:36.346
and that's giving people ideas of thinking
that they are not happily married.

01:36.429 --> 01:37.263
It's true.

01:37.347 --> 01:41.392
My dad was
the funniest person in the world,

01:41.476 --> 01:45.396
and he and my mother had a long marriage
before he unfortunately died.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.899
And they were married, I think, 33 years.

01:47.982 --> 01:52.112
And they were being interviewed,
I think for a morning show, one time,

01:52.195 --> 01:55.824
and, um, the interviewer said to them,
"So, what's the secret?"

01:55.907 --> 01:58.785
"You guys have been married
all this time and you have this…"

01:58.868 --> 02:00.370
"In Hollywood especially."

02:00.453 --> 02:05.166
And my dad said, "You know, we never
wanted to get divorced at the same time."

02:05.250 --> 02:07.418
[all laugh]

02:07.502 --> 02:08.336
Yeah.

02:09.420 --> 02:14.259
So I think it, like, beautifully states,
right, how… Like, that's what it is.

02:14.342 --> 02:15.969
Yeah. That's awesome.

02:16.052 --> 02:19.305
And when you're living together,
sharing a bed year after year.

02:19.389 --> 02:21.432
-Sharing a bathroom, raising kids…
-You're roommates.

02:21.516 --> 02:23.226
A completely different relationship.

02:23.309 --> 02:25.520
-Mm-hmm.
-And so it makes perfect sense,

02:25.603 --> 02:28.815
it's only natural that that spark, uh,

02:28.898 --> 02:31.568
that got the relationship started
is no longer there.

02:31.651 --> 02:33.736
There's something so incredible

02:33.820 --> 02:37.448
when you are willing
to ongoingly work on your relationship

02:37.532 --> 02:40.076
and to say,
"We're not going with the status quo,

02:40.160 --> 02:41.953
and we're also not breaking up."

02:42.036 --> 02:44.455
-That takes a lot of guts, you know, to--
-[Michaela] Yeah.

02:44.998 --> 02:45.832
Do it over.

02:45.915 --> 02:50.295
I was afraid that if I move on,
I would be in the same spot in ten years.

02:50.378 --> 02:51.379
-You would.
-You would.

02:51.462 --> 02:52.297
[both laugh]

02:52.380 --> 02:53.339
[Gwyneth] I mean…

02:54.048 --> 02:57.177
We were listening
to a podcast driving up here,

02:57.260 --> 03:00.305
and they were talking about
the nice guy syndrome and how,

03:00.388 --> 03:06.019
as a guy who wants to just please
your wife, like, "Happy wife, happy life,"

03:06.102 --> 03:10.648
you think you're doing everything right,
yet the woman is left totally unfulfilled.

03:10.732 --> 03:14.194
I was ready to tattoo the phrase
"Happy wife, happy life."

03:14.277 --> 03:17.739
-My God. I would've walked out that day.
-I was gonna tattoo it to my face.

03:17.822 --> 03:20.074
She did warn me that
if I did something like that,

03:20.158 --> 03:21.576
that it may not go over well.

03:21.659 --> 03:24.329
But I was so committed to that.

03:24.412 --> 03:26.789
And what you end up with is a relationship

03:26.873 --> 03:31.002
where the man is basically
circling around the woman's needs.

03:31.085 --> 03:33.463
Well, it's like a little boy and a mom.

03:33.546 --> 03:36.341
-And so then when--
-The boy wanting to please his mommy.

03:36.424 --> 03:38.676
It doesn't… It's not sexy, I think.

03:38.760 --> 03:41.095
You know, so, we're kind of at a loss.

03:41.721 --> 03:44.807
But I think the greater problem
is that there are no narratives

03:44.891 --> 03:50.605
for good sex or a sexual relationship
that's healthy in a long-term marriage.

03:50.688 --> 03:54.025
And so that's why I'm very excited
about learning from these experts,

03:54.108 --> 03:55.944
because they do seem to have the secret.

03:56.027 --> 03:58.446
-[both laugh]
-They seem to have the secrets.

03:59.155 --> 04:02.116
[soft piano music playing]

04:04.494 --> 04:07.622
While there's nothing wrong
with the way you praise her,

04:07.705 --> 04:09.916
for the sexual occasion,

04:09.999 --> 04:13.586
it's not going to produce the outcome.

04:13.670 --> 04:14.504
-Right?
-Right.

[Middle Eastern music playing]

04:22.136 --> 04:24.389
We're gonna work with your bodies

04:24.472 --> 04:26.849
in a way that
you can interact with each other

04:26.933 --> 04:29.686
from that place of softness and strength.

04:29.769 --> 04:32.522
What Rama and Felicitas were experiencing

04:32.605 --> 04:36.484
and what they came to us for
is very common.

04:36.567 --> 04:37.568
-Okay.
-Yep.

04:37.652 --> 04:40.697
Okay. Give me a pull. Give me a pull.

04:40.780 --> 04:43.199
[Michaela]
The kind of dynamic that they had was

04:43.283 --> 04:46.369
a little boy/overcritical mother dynamic.

04:46.452 --> 04:51.708
And so, they wanted to learn how to
redefine themselves as a husband and wife

04:51.791 --> 04:53.209
playing in the erotic.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.712
-Do we have blindfolds?
-[woman] Yes.

04:55.795 --> 04:57.171
-Okay.
-Cool.

04:57.255 --> 04:59.340
-Yes. Ah.
-[Rama and Felicitas chuckle]

05:00.425 --> 05:02.385
-Rama, you can pick one.
-Big and small.

05:02.468 --> 05:04.595
Yeah. Pick one for…

05:04.679 --> 05:07.015
-Oh. We will each wear--
-No, just for her.

05:07.098 --> 05:09.976
-Just for her? Okay. Let's do a soft one.
-Okay, good.

05:10.059 --> 05:12.937
So, here… Wait, wait, wait,
hold on, hold on, hold on.

05:13.021 --> 05:14.480
-He's like…
-[Felicitas laughs]

05:14.564 --> 05:16.733
Okay, so, we're gonna do this right.

05:16.816 --> 05:19.360
We're now playing with the sexual dynamic.

05:19.444 --> 05:23.197
So, you're going
to put that blindfold on her

05:23.281 --> 05:26.868
in a way that delights her entire body.

05:29.370 --> 05:31.456
-See, she just tensed up…
-Mm-hmm.

05:31.539 --> 05:33.916
…by the pure idea of that happening.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.171
Even though she likes it,
her body goes, "Let's see what you got."

05:38.254 --> 05:40.381
I don't know if you saw that.
Did you see that?

05:40.965 --> 05:41.966
-I did actually.
-Yeah.

05:42.050 --> 05:45.053
Yeah. She has a very specific look
on her face when it's like,

05:45.136 --> 05:46.512
"Uh, I don't know."

05:46.596 --> 05:48.264
Because I feel he's in this, like…

05:48.348 --> 05:51.059
-[laughs]
-Of course, but that's not for you to--

05:51.142 --> 05:52.060
I know, but it's--

05:52.143 --> 05:55.396
But what I'm saying is,
you don't have to say that.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.273
-Your body says that.
-Okay.

05:57.357 --> 06:00.777
Right? You don't exactly
have a poker face.

06:00.860 --> 06:01.903
[laughs]

06:01.986 --> 06:03.863
[Felicitas] I know that.
I've heard that before.

06:03.946 --> 06:04.947
[Michaela] So, exactly.

06:05.031 --> 06:06.199
So, he's aware.

06:06.282 --> 06:10.620
One of the dynamics we want to break
is the little boy/mommy dynamic

06:10.703 --> 06:13.247
where you go,
"I don't like the way he looks right now."

06:13.331 --> 06:14.749
-Well, so what?
-[Felicitas] Yeah.

06:14.832 --> 06:16.834
He doesn't know.
He's never done this before.

06:16.918 --> 06:18.336
-He'll figure it out.
-Yes.

06:18.419 --> 06:19.670
And we know he can,

06:19.754 --> 06:23.716
because he's named after one
of the greatest epic stories in the world.

06:23.800 --> 06:24.926
-Yeah.
-[Michaela] Yeah.

06:25.009 --> 06:27.387
And he's the king within that story.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.680
So why wouldn't he figure it out?

06:30.473 --> 06:31.599
-You know?
-Yeah.

06:32.141 --> 06:35.937
When I work with very
ingrained relationship dynamics,

06:36.020 --> 06:39.774
it's useful to give names

06:39.857 --> 06:44.946
that trigger the ability
to enter their sexual personas.

06:45.029 --> 06:50.785
We started calling him King Rama
as a means of inviting the grown man,

06:50.868 --> 06:54.705
the, you know, adult to the sexual place.

06:54.789 --> 06:57.208
See if you can do this
from the king place.

06:57.291 --> 06:58.501
[Rama] Right.

06:58.584 --> 07:00.002
[Michaela] Drop your energy.

07:00.837 --> 07:02.004
[exhales]

07:02.088 --> 07:04.966
Now enter the battlefield

07:05.049 --> 07:06.801
as the king that you are.

07:06.884 --> 07:08.886
[intense guitar music playing]

07:35.371 --> 07:37.290
[Michaela] Traditionally speaking,

07:37.373 --> 07:41.085
there has to be attraction
between the two partners

07:41.169 --> 07:44.755
in some way
that galvanizes the sexual action.

07:46.841 --> 07:51.512
We sometimes call it sexual polarity
or erotic friction, which is…

07:51.596 --> 07:54.474
There's a tension between two poles.

07:54.557 --> 07:57.143
It's another way of saying
opposites attract.

08:01.105 --> 08:04.066
There's a soft, surrendering aspect,

08:04.150 --> 08:08.279
and there is a focused, guiding aspect.

08:13.576 --> 08:15.786
That's what makes for that…

08:15.870 --> 08:17.371
that hotness.

08:17.997 --> 08:18.998
Okay.

08:20.124 --> 08:23.211
You can take her blindfold off. [laughs]

08:23.294 --> 08:24.921
[Rama chuckles]

08:25.963 --> 08:26.964
[Felicitas] Well.

08:27.048 --> 08:28.424
[giggles]

08:28.508 --> 08:29.592
That was pretty good.

08:30.092 --> 08:32.512
[all laugh]

08:32.595 --> 08:36.015
That is a high compliment
from the lips of Felicitas.

08:36.098 --> 08:38.100
[laughs]

08:40.394 --> 08:42.855
So, if you knew all along,
then why don't you do that?

08:42.939 --> 08:44.565
[all chortle]

08:44.649 --> 08:47.610
I'm kidding. This was so spot on.

08:47.693 --> 08:49.195
So, let's rewind this.

08:49.278 --> 08:53.824
You got to get into the habit of,
"That was good, I liked this,"

08:53.908 --> 08:56.577
without criticizing it right afterwards.

08:56.661 --> 08:57.703
Okay.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.122
Something I'm a real stickler for

09:00.206 --> 09:03.459
is that sexual feedback
is not given in the moment.

09:03.543 --> 09:04.627
Why not?

09:04.710 --> 09:07.713
Because you start having
negative associations.

09:07.797 --> 09:08.923
-Oh. Interesting.
-Right?

09:09.006 --> 09:13.386
Because essentially, bodies are
built to remember things, right?

09:13.469 --> 09:17.932
And sexual engagement
has to do a lot with biochemistry

09:18.015 --> 09:20.434
and the nervous system,
and relaxing and opening.

09:20.518 --> 09:22.019
When you get negative feedback

09:22.103 --> 09:26.816
in a place where you're supposed
to open up and feel hot and heavy,

09:26.899 --> 09:29.986
it's very likely that
you're not gonna be as open

09:30.069 --> 09:32.321
the next time you're in that place.

09:32.405 --> 09:35.866
It's so hard to sometimes take
the step back because we're just often

09:36.617 --> 09:38.077
so caught up in our emotions.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.788
And at the same time, I was shocked

09:40.871 --> 09:43.583
when I realized,
"There are different ways to communicate."

09:43.666 --> 09:47.086
We're human beings, we all have problems,
we all have unresolved stuff.

09:47.169 --> 09:52.508
You gotta stay curious, especially when
there's some friction points in your life,

09:52.592 --> 09:55.344
and things aren't feeling
exactly as they should,

09:55.428 --> 09:59.015
which is just part of the process
of being a human being, right?

09:59.098 --> 10:00.016
[woman] Yeah.

10:00.099 --> 10:04.729
Thank you for acknowledging
that this is something that we need.

10:04.812 --> 10:08.065
Unfortunately, as Black people,
we don't have those conversations much.

10:08.149 --> 10:12.194
I grew up with girlfriends whose parents
were doctors, so I went to therapy.

10:12.278 --> 10:14.739
I was like, "No problem!"
I didn't feel weird about it.

10:14.822 --> 10:16.824
For him, I think it's different.

10:16.907 --> 10:19.535
I think culturally, there is a stigma.

10:19.619 --> 10:23.289
Myself, I'm not opposed to the therapy,

10:23.372 --> 10:26.500
but I feel like if there's
something I need to talk about,

10:26.584 --> 10:28.044
I talk to her about it.

10:28.127 --> 10:31.380
[interviewer]
So, why come to sex therapy together?

10:31.464 --> 10:36.093
Because sometimes it feels like
I'm not figuring it out, you know?

10:36.177 --> 10:38.137
Sometimes she feels like
I'm not hearing her.

10:38.638 --> 10:39.764
I love you.

10:40.389 --> 10:41.474
I love you too.

10:42.433 --> 10:43.559
Well, okay.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.061
[chuckles]

10:45.144 --> 10:50.149
It's been an argument for a while that
he's wanted kids, and I've been not ready.

10:50.232 --> 10:53.819
I feel like there's some things that
we need help with, both sexually and…

10:53.903 --> 10:57.948
Initiating? He hasn't tried the things
that I said would make me wanna try more.

10:58.032 --> 11:00.618
You want more sex, I'm telling you
here's how to get more sex,

11:00.701 --> 11:02.244
but you're not willing to do it.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.997
So we need somebody neutral,
kind of, I think to--

11:05.081 --> 11:06.540
-Yeah.
-To help.

11:07.583 --> 11:09.794
All right.
So, just nice, big, deep breath.

11:10.419 --> 11:13.714
We're gonna do the same thing we did
on you, we're gonna start energetic.

11:13.798 --> 11:16.550
So, start with your hands above his body.

11:27.853 --> 11:30.231
-Kinda play with the hairs.
-[Erika] Mm-hmm.

11:30.314 --> 11:32.566
You know, like,
just barely touching them.

11:33.067 --> 11:36.112
It gives a little bit of stimulation,
but it's still energetic.

11:36.195 --> 11:37.196
[Erika] Mm-hmm.

11:37.905 --> 11:40.074
Ooh. Did you see that?

11:40.783 --> 11:44.078
Damon's quiz results said
that he was the sexual blueprint.

11:44.161 --> 11:47.748
The sexual is someone who's turned on
by what we think of as sex in our culture.

11:47.832 --> 11:51.377
Intercourse, orgasms,
penetration, genitals, nudity.

11:51.460 --> 11:52.795
Take a finger.

11:53.754 --> 11:57.550
And you're gonna
spiral in towards his nipple.

11:59.719 --> 12:03.305
But there's who we think
we need to be as erotic beings,

12:03.389 --> 12:06.183
and then there's
who we really are as erotic beings.

12:07.184 --> 12:08.227
Then check in with him.

12:08.310 --> 12:10.688
On a scale of one to five,
how pleasurable is this?

12:10.771 --> 12:13.232
Yeah, that's like a 47.

12:13.315 --> 12:16.235
[Jaiya laughs] Forty-seven.
We've gone up the scale.

12:16.318 --> 12:18.696
[Erika] He can't even
think of the numbers.

12:18.779 --> 12:21.157
You're a candidate
for a full-body orgasm.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.158
[Damon] Mm.

12:23.909 --> 12:28.748
There's this thing in our culture with,
especially, cisgendered, heterosexual men,

12:28.831 --> 12:32.084
of, this is how you're supposed to be
when you're orgasming.

12:32.168 --> 12:35.171
It's easy. It's like, okay,
slot A goes into slot B,

12:35.254 --> 12:36.881
and explosive! [imitates explosion]

12:36.964 --> 12:38.132
And that's how it works.

12:38.215 --> 12:40.509
We need to include
all the expressions of pleasure.

12:40.593 --> 12:44.138
It doesn't have to be genital-focused
orgasm. It can be anywhere on their body.

12:48.934 --> 12:50.102
[Erika] How does that feel?

12:50.186 --> 12:51.562
That's a four.

12:51.645 --> 12:53.355
-[Erika] That's a four?
-That's a five.

12:53.439 --> 12:55.691
-[Jaiya chuckles] And now it's a five.
-[Erika] Oh.

12:56.901 --> 13:00.821
And let's start to just play
with dragging it up and down the leg.

13:00.905 --> 13:02.072
Okay.

13:02.156 --> 13:03.157
[Jaiya] Across.

13:05.868 --> 13:09.538
See how he's getting, like,
goose pimples all over?

13:09.622 --> 13:13.000
These goose pimples show
how he's able to uptake pleasure.

13:13.083 --> 13:16.045
-[Erika] Mm-hmm.
-It's an erection in each hair follicle.

13:17.171 --> 13:18.589
My hair is getting hard.

13:18.672 --> 13:21.509
[women laugh]

13:23.677 --> 13:26.180
[Jaiya] And Damon, I'll have you
breathe in and out your mouth.

13:26.263 --> 13:27.681
[inhales]

13:27.765 --> 13:30.476
And then just let it fall out like…
[exhales]

13:30.559 --> 13:32.561
[Damon inhales]

13:33.729 --> 13:35.397
[exhales]

13:35.481 --> 13:38.692
[inhales]

13:39.193 --> 13:41.320
[exhales]

13:42.363 --> 13:43.781
Ah. [chuckles]

13:43.864 --> 13:47.701
[continues inhaling and exhaling]

14:01.090 --> 14:03.050
Good. Now exhale
and relax all the muscles.

14:03.133 --> 14:04.176
[grunts, exhales]

14:12.101 --> 14:14.019
You noticing that shiver in your body?

14:14.103 --> 14:15.479
[Damon] Mm-hmm.

14:15.563 --> 14:18.482
It's because there's a lot of energy
that wants to move through your body,

14:18.566 --> 14:20.734
and you're holding a little tension of it.

14:20.818 --> 14:22.570
Yeah, see how that's moving now?

14:22.653 --> 14:24.572
-Mm-hmm.
-[Jaiya] Yeah. Let it shake.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.950
It's okay. It's orgasmic energy.

14:29.577 --> 14:30.578
Oh, man.

14:36.208 --> 14:37.501
-[Erika] Yeah.
-[Jaiya] Big tears.

14:42.464 --> 14:46.051
-[Erika] Ah.
-See this? This is energetic orgasm.

14:46.135 --> 14:49.889
I bet you didn't know you could have
energetic orgasms. Did you?

14:51.682 --> 14:54.143
If you want to lay
your chest over his chest

14:54.226 --> 14:58.147
and then just squeeze his arms
towards his body.

14:58.230 --> 15:00.608
[soft piano music playing]

15:02.610 --> 15:04.612
[heart beating]

15:10.451 --> 15:12.036
[Damon groans] I'm really sensitive.

15:12.536 --> 15:13.495
[Jaiya] Mm-hmm.

15:13.579 --> 15:16.665
I think we just opened you up
in your true blueprint.

15:18.167 --> 15:19.043
[kisses]

15:19.126 --> 15:20.252
I love you.

15:21.378 --> 15:23.756
Mmm. I love you so much, baby.

15:23.839 --> 15:25.215
Oh, I love you too.

15:25.716 --> 15:27.676
[Jaiya] So look in each other's eyes.

15:28.218 --> 15:29.136
Right here.

15:29.219 --> 15:30.054
[Erika] I love you.

15:31.221 --> 15:33.015
[whispering] Love you too, baby.

15:34.016 --> 15:36.435
[Erika] I think you're gonna
sleep really good tonight.

15:36.518 --> 15:38.395
-Mm.
-[chuckles]

15:38.479 --> 15:42.191
When I was watching
some of the footage of Erika and Damon…

15:43.525 --> 15:48.364
When he was receiving, it was
so vulnerable and emotional for him.

15:49.406 --> 15:53.243
And I thought, "Gosh, like,
we've never really seen this before."

15:55.454 --> 16:00.584
It's so antithetical to our kind
of archetypal male in the bedroom.

16:00.668 --> 16:07.383
I think in general, most men associate
weakness with that kind of surrender.

16:07.466 --> 16:09.510
Are those little tears?

16:12.596 --> 16:14.807
[Jaiya] We are orgasmic beings,

16:14.890 --> 16:18.894
and our natural state
is one of bliss and pleasure.

16:18.978 --> 16:22.022
Every cell in our bodies
is wired for pleasure.

16:23.607 --> 16:29.029
And so, I think this is just an opening
of our body to our true state of being.

16:29.905 --> 16:32.783
And so we're raising a baseline
of how we normally operate,

16:32.866 --> 16:37.454
and stress, and cortisol, and going
through life, not present, not here.

16:38.038 --> 16:41.375
And then when we hit a state
where we feel what's actually really here,

16:41.458 --> 16:43.002
it's overwhelming.

16:43.085 --> 16:46.714
And so we have phenomenon, we have
the body shaking and jerking and twitching

16:46.797 --> 16:51.176
as it's trying to assimilate so much
moving through our bodies.

16:51.760 --> 16:54.430
I'll tell you a bit about
your blueprint and his blueprint.

16:54.513 --> 16:55.347
[Erika] Okay.

16:55.431 --> 17:00.019
So, a lot of times,
people can take on a masking…

17:00.102 --> 17:01.103
Okay, yeah.

17:01.186 --> 17:05.816
…um, of "This is how I'm supposed to be
as a man sexually in the world,"

17:05.899 --> 17:08.819
because it's how they've been taught
that they're supposed to be.

17:08.902 --> 17:11.405
So, you're actually an energetic

17:11.488 --> 17:14.199
with sexual, sensual underneath that.

17:15.325 --> 17:20.122
Which is good news for the two of you
because you're both very high energetics.

17:20.789 --> 17:22.583
So, what do you notice
in your body now?

17:22.666 --> 17:24.334
It feels like after sex.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.629
-Yay!
-[laughs]

17:27.713 --> 17:31.258
Guess what.
You did actually just have sex.

17:31.341 --> 17:32.176
[Damon] Mm.

17:32.259 --> 17:36.096
It's just that the sexual's definition
of sex is intercourse.

17:37.056 --> 17:41.518
The energetic's definition of sex
is what you just experienced.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.146
Oh my gosh.

17:45.189 --> 17:46.815
What just happened to me?

17:47.399 --> 17:49.443
[interviewer] So are you a happy man?

17:49.526 --> 17:51.070
I'm super giddy right now.

17:52.362 --> 17:55.657
I guess that might be
a by-product of what happened today.

17:58.452 --> 17:59.495
I mean, um…

18:00.704 --> 18:03.248
[sniffs] No matter
what it looked like on camera…

18:03.791 --> 18:06.376
Man, if you haven't felt that before…

18:07.461 --> 18:09.338
[hissing sound]

18:12.091 --> 18:13.425
I actually can't…

18:14.802 --> 18:16.345
correctly describe it.

18:17.679 --> 18:20.057
I'm just enjoying this feeling right now.

18:20.557 --> 18:24.394
And I'm super excited
to learn how to keep doing this,

18:24.478 --> 18:26.897
and for us to keep doing this.

18:28.065 --> 18:28.941
So, yeah.

18:29.817 --> 18:31.777
It just expanded my whole body.

18:31.860 --> 18:35.239
It was the same feeling
that I usually have after sex.

18:35.781 --> 18:36.782
Turned all the way up.

18:36.865 --> 18:39.785
I can still feel it right now.

18:39.868 --> 18:41.411
I can still feel it right now,

18:41.495 --> 18:46.834
and I've never had this feeling
last this long or go that high.

18:46.917 --> 18:48.710
And it's really good also

18:48.794 --> 18:52.089
because we're in
the same category, sexually.

18:52.673 --> 18:55.843
I'm really wondering
what's in store for the next two days.

18:56.426 --> 19:01.098
I mean, this was just the beginning,
and I'm already ratcheted up this high.

19:02.307 --> 19:03.350
Shoot.

19:03.433 --> 19:06.687
My dick might fall off. [laughs]

19:06.770 --> 19:09.231
[percussive music playing]

19:19.116 --> 19:20.409
[Michaela] All right.

19:20.492 --> 19:25.956
So, we're gonna go a little bit more
into a sensitivity-building exercise

19:26.039 --> 19:28.792
where you're transmitting
a bit of energy back and forth.

19:28.876 --> 19:31.003
You can put your blindfolds on.

19:32.296 --> 19:34.214
And once you have your blindfolds on,

19:34.840 --> 19:37.176
you stay touching palm to palm.

19:37.759 --> 19:39.511
Perfect.

19:39.595 --> 19:42.848
So, the key here is to go back…

19:43.557 --> 19:46.560
Exactly. And now the other way.
Reverse direction.

19:46.643 --> 19:50.939
Synchronize those starting movements
with your breath.

19:54.067 --> 19:54.943
Good.

19:57.029 --> 20:02.701
Felicitas and Rama, they're very heady,
intellectually-oriented people.

20:02.784 --> 20:06.288
So, when we take sight away
and connect bodies,

20:06.371 --> 20:10.167
the externally-referenced
thinking subsides.

20:10.250 --> 20:14.213
This particular exercise
amplifies the erotic attraction.

20:15.797 --> 20:20.969
And so now Felicitas can
actually track your natural breath

20:21.053 --> 20:22.512
because you're leading.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.265
It has a leading and following quality

20:25.349 --> 20:32.314
that programs the body to learn
the principles of that erotic friction.

20:32.397 --> 20:38.111
In a very short period of time, even with
people who are not feeling very sexy,

20:38.195 --> 20:39.529
it can get very sexy.

20:40.113 --> 20:42.241
Can I get somebody to get some music?

20:42.324 --> 20:43.825
-[woman] Yeah.
-[Michaela] Thank you.

20:44.368 --> 20:45.827
Good. And so now…

20:46.370 --> 20:47.913
[soft guitar music playing]

20:47.996 --> 20:53.502
Rama, from here in a moment,
you can lead Felicitas on a little journey

20:53.585 --> 20:55.671
through your inner landscape.

20:57.422 --> 21:00.592
"This is who I am right now."

21:01.677 --> 21:04.096
"This is me as love."

21:06.306 --> 21:10.060
"This is love moving through me."

21:11.144 --> 21:17.317
Felicitas, all you need to do
is allow yourself to follow along.

21:22.030 --> 21:25.534
And, seamlessly,
Felicitas is taking over.

21:25.617 --> 21:31.748
"Oh yeah, feel my heart.
Here is my heart. This is how I love."

21:33.959 --> 21:37.921
"This is who I am as a sexual being."

21:38.588 --> 21:44.011
"Come along on the ride
through my inner sexual landscape."

21:47.139 --> 21:49.308
And then Rama is taking back over.

21:50.517 --> 21:52.978
[both chuckle]

21:59.693 --> 22:01.361
[both giggle]

22:01.445 --> 22:06.241
[Michaela] Felicitas really loves when
she doesn't have to think and control.

22:06.325 --> 22:10.037
And she gets very happy,
and you can see it in her face.

22:10.120 --> 22:13.040
She softens, she becomes bright,

22:13.123 --> 22:17.044
her body relaxes,
she giggles, she's playful,

22:17.127 --> 22:21.631
and he really loves when
she allows him to take over,

22:21.715 --> 22:26.094
and it makes for a very different,
and I think, very rich-to-explore dynamic

22:26.178 --> 22:27.804
between the two of them.

22:28.764 --> 22:32.059
And now you can, uh, use your entire body.

22:32.142 --> 22:35.228
[sensual music playing]

22:44.654 --> 22:48.742
[Gwyneth] As women, we've sort of given
ourselves so much responsibility,

22:48.825 --> 22:51.036
and we work really hard,
we're raising our kids,

22:51.119 --> 22:53.789
we're cooking and
we're trying to be all of these things,

22:53.872 --> 22:59.878
and we've sort of forgotten the importance
of, at least for me, of, like,

23:00.587 --> 23:05.050
getting completely back
into the softness of the body.

23:05.133 --> 23:06.134
[chuckles]

23:06.218 --> 23:09.930
It might be different for people
of different genders and relationships,

23:10.013 --> 23:15.685
but for me, it's so restorative
when I can be completely open

23:15.769 --> 23:19.773
and soft and vulnerable
and not in control,

23:19.856 --> 23:24.736
and I really only have that
within the context of my marriage.

23:24.820 --> 23:29.616
There is still also a bit of stigma around
wanting to be soft and surrendered.

23:29.699 --> 23:33.120
Or that it's, you know, against feminism…

23:33.203 --> 23:36.039
-Exactly. Yes.
-…to submit to your partner sexually.

23:36.123 --> 23:37.165
[Michaela] Yes. Yes.

23:37.249 --> 23:43.171
But it's a voluntary act
that actually is very empowering.

23:43.255 --> 23:46.049
And this is, by the way,
the same for queer couples,

23:46.133 --> 23:47.968
lesbian couples, gay…

23:48.051 --> 23:49.469
-It doesn't matter.
-Right.

23:49.553 --> 23:53.807
It's active surrender and not,
um, you know, passive surrender.

23:53.890 --> 23:56.435
You're not just, like,
flopping over, being a doormat.

23:56.518 --> 24:00.021
You're actively saying,
"There's another part of me."

24:00.105 --> 24:00.939
[Gwyneth] Right.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.316
And you're actually really good at that.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.110
I like to be in that state.

24:05.193 --> 24:07.904
Yeah. Brad likes it too
that you're in that state.

24:07.988 --> 24:08.822
[laughs]

24:08.905 --> 24:11.158
[Michaela]
Let's see how much fun we can make this.

24:11.241 --> 24:12.576
[Rama] Wonderful.

24:17.914 --> 24:20.625
-The king's pillow. [laughs]
-The king. The king.

24:20.709 --> 24:21.668
Good.

24:21.751 --> 24:26.006
At the very end,
we put Rama on his king chair,

24:26.089 --> 24:29.718
so he was comfortable,
his body was open and relaxed,

24:29.801 --> 24:35.682
but also as a symbol for him
taking his seat as a grown, adult man

24:35.765 --> 24:38.977
within that relationship,
versus the little boy.

24:39.644 --> 24:45.567
And Felicitas is submissive in the sense
that she's not calling the shots.

24:45.650 --> 24:48.236
So it's her antidote to the general.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.946
You're gonna essentially go like…

24:51.198 --> 24:52.073
"Here." You know?

24:52.157 --> 24:57.829
Uh, exactly. And you're gonna tell her
what you'd like for her to do.

24:57.913 --> 25:00.957
-Okay.
-You know, "Come here. On your knees."

25:01.041 --> 25:02.459
-"Do this. Do that."
-[Rama] Yes.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.003
Uh, maybe sit on him?

25:05.086 --> 25:09.508
I was just gonna say. But that would mean
I am giving him a lap dance on Netflix.

25:09.591 --> 25:11.301
[all laugh]

25:11.384 --> 25:13.220
-Are you up for this? Good. Good.
-Yeah.

25:13.303 --> 25:14.471
So, where should I…

25:14.554 --> 25:16.097
-That's up to the king.
-Okay.

25:16.181 --> 25:18.517
[Rama] I would like you to start
over there at that window.

25:18.600 --> 25:19.851
[chuckles softly] Okay.

25:19.935 --> 25:22.020
[Michaela] Do you want
a bit of music in the background?

25:22.604 --> 25:23.647
-Sure.
-Yeah.

25:23.730 --> 25:25.065
Take one of those mats.

25:26.191 --> 25:28.652
And roll it out here in front of me.

25:30.070 --> 25:32.906
And walk the catwalk for me a little bit.

25:33.990 --> 25:34.991
Ooh.

25:36.743 --> 25:38.620
I love the way you look when you crawl.

25:38.703 --> 25:41.206
That's what the mat is for, my dear.

25:41.289 --> 25:42.499
[chuckles]

25:42.999 --> 25:44.000
All right.

25:44.918 --> 25:45.961
Ooh.

26:04.187 --> 26:05.981
Why don't you have a seat here?

26:07.107 --> 26:08.275
Turn around.

26:15.198 --> 26:16.074
How was that?

26:17.075 --> 26:19.703
-That was excellent.
-[all laugh]

26:19.786 --> 26:22.122
[Michaela] Okay. Very nice.

26:22.205 --> 26:25.083
Did you have moments in this
where you felt the spark?

26:25.166 --> 26:29.129
Yes. The tease. I just love
a lot of flirting and all of that.

26:29.212 --> 26:33.216
Okay, good. Is there anything
that you would want more of

26:33.300 --> 26:36.261
or something that
you absolutely don't want to do?

26:36.344 --> 26:38.555
-I think you did a really good job…
-Mm-hmm.

26:38.638 --> 26:40.599
…but you were trying to be very nice.

26:40.682 --> 26:42.767
-So, in the privacy of your own home…
-Right.

26:42.851 --> 26:44.352
…he could be a little bit dirtier?

26:44.436 --> 26:48.982
Maybe dirtier
and just focusing on the commands.

26:49.733 --> 26:53.278
-Okay, so that's very, very good feedback.
-[Rama] Okay.

26:53.361 --> 26:58.241
Even now, the way he's sitting there is…
he's much more, you know, there.

26:58.325 --> 26:59.242
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

26:59.326 --> 27:02.370
And that has to do with him
finding it in his body,

27:02.454 --> 27:04.414
but also you treating him as such.

27:04.497 --> 27:05.332
[Felicitas] Yes.

27:05.874 --> 27:07.542
I feel a sense of relief.

27:07.626 --> 27:10.462
I feel a weight has been lifted because

27:10.545 --> 27:13.173
I feel like Felicitas
really saw me for who I am.

27:14.549 --> 27:17.052
A creative leader,
intimately and sexually.

27:18.136 --> 27:19.471
And I want to be seen, period.

27:19.554 --> 27:22.432
I want to be seen, heard
and recognized and acknowledged, right?

27:22.515 --> 27:25.977
But when you grab for respect,
that doesn't work.

27:26.061 --> 27:29.898
Respect is something you have to earn,
and so it's gonna take time.

27:30.565 --> 27:33.151
We're just getting started. [laughs]

27:33.818 --> 27:36.363
I think what I would like
people to know is that

27:36.446 --> 27:41.576
we often are in situations
where we really see no path forward,

27:41.660 --> 27:44.871
and it's amazing once you slow down.

27:45.622 --> 27:50.502
I did not expect
that we could make these leaps.

27:50.585 --> 27:54.631
And so, that really has me
kind of in awe of what is possible.

27:55.298 --> 27:57.676
I think oftentimes
we're triggered and reacting,

27:57.759 --> 28:00.387
and I think in those moments
we can destroy so much.

28:02.555 --> 28:07.727
But if we can figure out a way
to open our hearts more and try to listen…

28:07.811 --> 28:10.522
And oftentimes, you know,
we do need help for that.

28:11.564 --> 28:15.443
I think we can be an example
for how much there is actually to explore

28:15.527 --> 28:17.570
when you think there's nothing left,

28:17.654 --> 28:20.907
and that could be helpful
to a lot of people.

28:20.990 --> 28:23.743
[birds chirping]

28:33.378 --> 28:36.423
[Jaiya] I wanna hear all about
how you're doing this morning.

28:36.506 --> 28:39.134
I'm just really relaxed.
Woke up feeling really good.

28:39.217 --> 28:42.220
-At first, trying to come down…
-[Jaiya laughs] Uh-huh.

28:42.303 --> 28:45.390
That was… Yeah, I was stuck up here.

28:45.473 --> 28:46.391
-[Erika] Yeah.
-Uh-huh.

28:46.474 --> 28:49.769
And I was like, "Just calm down,
calm down, calm down." You know?

28:49.853 --> 28:51.271
Woosah, woosah.

28:51.354 --> 28:53.106
-And… Yeah.
-To ground yourself.

28:53.189 --> 28:54.190
-Yeah.
-[Jaiya] Yeah.

28:54.274 --> 28:58.153
So, part of it, too,
is getting used to that place,

28:58.236 --> 29:01.364
and your baseline being
you're operating in the world,

29:01.448 --> 29:04.409
living in a beautiful, orgasmic place.

29:04.492 --> 29:05.368
Wow.

29:05.452 --> 29:06.619
So…

29:06.703 --> 29:09.330
I just pictured myself
walking down the street… [moans]

29:09.414 --> 29:11.416
[all laugh]

29:11.499 --> 29:12.542
I get that frequently.

29:12.625 --> 29:16.254
When people first have this experience,
"What do I do with that energy?"

29:16.337 --> 29:18.548
"How do I play with that energy?"

29:18.631 --> 29:20.884
And so that can be kind of a scary moment.

29:20.967 --> 29:23.887
Integration is about
now taking this home.

29:23.970 --> 29:27.515
And so, the integration
that I designed for Erika and Damon

29:27.599 --> 29:30.560
was about helping them do this,
'cause this experience is great,

29:30.643 --> 29:33.646
but it doesn't mean anything
if they go back to their default mode.

29:33.730 --> 29:36.775
All right. So, I'm here
with my partner, Ian. This is Ian.

29:36.858 --> 29:38.234
-Great to meet you.
-[both] Hey, Ian.

29:38.318 --> 29:39.778
The two of you both being energetic,

29:39.861 --> 29:43.072
I wanna show you
just a teeny bit of what's possible.

29:43.156 --> 29:47.994
One of the things that really helped me
to continue to open to the energetic

29:48.077 --> 29:49.871
was the game of "Yes."

29:49.954 --> 29:50.830
Just say yes.

29:50.914 --> 29:55.001
So this kind of thing of, where you're
playing with the energy of your hands,

29:55.084 --> 29:56.336
and do you feel warmth,

29:56.419 --> 30:00.006
it's simply being able to be
present enough and open enough

30:00.089 --> 30:02.217
to just say,
"Okay, yes, I feel something."

30:02.300 --> 30:03.968
"I'm just going to say yes to it,"

30:04.052 --> 30:07.347
instead of this head trip of,
"What's it mean? Where does it go?"

30:07.430 --> 30:10.558
"Is this erotic? Is this…"
All of the things, of the judgments

30:10.642 --> 30:14.145
that might push a sensation away
and just continue to be in the yes.

30:14.229 --> 30:15.188
[Damon] Mm-hmm.

30:15.271 --> 30:16.523
I'm gonna wear a blindfold

30:16.606 --> 30:19.609
just because I don't want
anybody to think I'm cheating.

30:19.692 --> 30:20.527
Okay, you ready?

30:20.610 --> 30:22.779
-[Erika] We're ready.
-[Jaiya chuckles] Okay.

30:26.616 --> 30:28.451
All right. I'd love for you to start…

30:28.535 --> 30:30.745
-[Ian] Little grounding?
-…with a little grounding. Yeah.

30:30.829 --> 30:34.332
Like, one hand either pubic bone or heart.

30:34.415 --> 30:35.333
Okay.

30:40.672 --> 30:42.924
Ooh. [chuckles]

30:45.134 --> 30:46.469
[inhales]

30:46.553 --> 30:47.762
[moans]

30:50.139 --> 30:52.141
[exhales shakily]

30:57.730 --> 31:00.233
[moans]

31:03.486 --> 31:06.281
[groans, chuckles]

31:06.364 --> 31:07.907
Oh…

31:10.034 --> 31:12.537
[grunts]

31:13.538 --> 31:14.497
Ah.

31:16.124 --> 31:18.835
[moans]

31:19.377 --> 31:20.587
Ooh.

31:21.379 --> 31:23.381
[laughs, grunts]

31:27.635 --> 31:28.803
Hold still.

31:28.887 --> 31:32.849
Then very slowly, like you're
pulling a thread, just start to pull.

31:34.267 --> 31:35.977
Ooh. Slow. Slow.

31:36.561 --> 31:38.563
[moans, chuckles]

31:39.230 --> 31:41.733
[groans]

31:41.816 --> 31:44.360
-Are you at the top of my head too? Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

31:48.364 --> 31:49.324
Yeah.

31:52.410 --> 31:54.162
[groans]

31:55.997 --> 31:59.125
So, Damon, see how I'm letting it
move through my whole chest?

31:59.208 --> 32:01.711
There's tension, right?
The tension happens in the body,

32:01.794 --> 32:04.505
and I have to let it
move through my whole heart

32:04.589 --> 32:06.215
and then into my neck

32:06.299 --> 32:10.136
so that that energy moves
through your whole spine.

32:11.846 --> 32:14.766
Right there's the sweet spot.
That's where I feel it the most.

32:15.808 --> 32:17.518
[moans, chuckles]

32:22.774 --> 32:24.025
[exhales]

32:24.859 --> 32:27.904
[breathing heavily]

32:53.554 --> 32:55.890
[both moan]

32:57.558 --> 32:59.769
And then he'll start to get it too.

33:00.436 --> 33:01.813
[laughs]

33:03.815 --> 33:04.857
Whoo!

33:05.441 --> 33:06.275
Okay.

33:06.818 --> 33:07.860
-[Jaiya] Okay.
-Shit.

33:08.736 --> 33:12.115
She went zero to 60 like that.

33:12.198 --> 33:14.158
So, that was incredible.

33:14.242 --> 33:16.119
-If you could be total still.
-Yeah.

33:16.202 --> 33:17.495
Thank you.

33:17.578 --> 33:21.290
To me, it really looked like
a magician and his assistant,

33:21.374 --> 33:22.834
except her energy is real.

33:24.127 --> 33:27.046
Like, he is completely
in tune with her body,

33:27.130 --> 33:31.092
and she is completely aware of her body.

33:31.175 --> 33:32.385
Yeah, good.

33:32.468 --> 33:34.887
I was like,
"Okay, that's where I want to get to."

33:34.971 --> 33:36.806
I'm the receiver in that situation.

33:36.889 --> 33:39.517
I want to show you
how this can go between the two of you.

33:40.143 --> 33:41.352
Okay.

33:41.436 --> 33:44.897
First I drive the energy
down into my genitals

33:44.981 --> 33:47.316
so that I'm getting
a little bit of turn-on there.

33:47.400 --> 33:50.528
So you could be in intercourse
or not in intercourse with this.

33:51.988 --> 33:54.115
And then we can start to move together.

33:55.116 --> 33:57.827
[both breathing heavily]

34:15.762 --> 34:17.847
[both inhale]

34:32.445 --> 34:36.616
[both moan, exhale]

34:40.870 --> 34:44.040
Watching Jaiya and her partner,
I'm like, "Sign me up."

34:44.791 --> 34:48.711
And sometimes you will need
to hold on for dear life to your partner.

34:48.795 --> 34:50.338
I mean, seriously?

34:50.421 --> 34:55.259
If you can get that type of connection
with your person you already love,

34:55.343 --> 34:56.761
like, what more is there?

34:56.844 --> 34:59.555
And there'll be a moment
when you'll feel her whole body go…

35:04.894 --> 35:08.523
And just in that moment, let her be
in that moment if that ever happens.

35:08.606 --> 35:09.482
Nice.

35:09.565 --> 35:13.152
If you can actually get to a heightened

35:13.236 --> 35:16.447
spiritual, emotional,
physical level with your partner?

35:19.242 --> 35:20.868
Jackpot. [chuckles]

35:20.952 --> 35:24.664
[soft percussive music playing]
