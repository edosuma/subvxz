Liv:
<i>The night that</i>
<i>i was hit by lightning,</i>

00:10.911 --> 00:13.612
<i>-I don't remember much.</i>
-(thunder strikes)

00:13.614 --> 00:15.614
<i>I wandered away</i>
<i>from the football game</i>

00:15.616 --> 00:18.183
<i>And wound up</i>
<i>at the clock tower.</i>

00:21.322 --> 00:24.823
<i>I could feel</i>
<i>something inside me</i>
<i>was different.</i>

00:24.825 --> 00:27.192
(panting, grunting)

00:27.194 --> 00:30.662
<i>But what i didn't know</i>
<i>was that everything</i>
<i>had changed.</i>

00:30.664 --> 00:33.499
<i>Everyone has secrets</i>
<i>in high school.</i>

00:33.501 --> 00:36.535
<i>Mine could destroy</i>

00:36.537 --> 00:38.437
<i>Or save it.</i>

00:45.346 --> 00:47.713

01:13.874 --> 01:15.874
-Cut!
-(bell rings)

01:15.876 --> 01:17.876
That is a wrap

01:17.878 --> 01:21.547
On day one of <i> voltage!</i>
(laughing)

01:21.549 --> 01:24.249
We are shooting
the very first episode

01:24.251 --> 01:26.418
Of my new show <i> voltage</i>

01:26.420 --> 01:28.320
And i am so excited!

01:28.322 --> 01:31.356
Gemma, our amazing director,
knows, like, everything

01:31.358 --> 01:33.492
About every comic book
ever written.

01:33.494 --> 01:36.762
So she's basically joey,
except with social graces.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.530
Liv!

01:38.532 --> 01:42.267
Do you see
the thought bubble

01:42.269 --> 01:44.002
Over my head?

01:44.004 --> 01:47.439
I don't,
but i will trust you
that it's there.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.775
Oh, it is there, baby.

01:49.777 --> 01:53.378
And it says
that was literally

01:53.380 --> 01:55.547
The greatest thing
i have ever seen.

01:55.549 --> 01:57.349
Thank you, gemma!

01:57.351 --> 01:59.885
When tess realizes
she has electromagnetic powers

01:59.887 --> 02:01.687
Because she was struck
by lightning,

02:01.689 --> 02:03.589
She is both confused
and overwhelmed.

02:03.591 --> 02:07.526
You brought that
to life!

02:07.528 --> 02:09.027
Just wait until tomorrow.

02:09.029 --> 02:11.897
I cannot wait to shoot
in my new super suit.

02:11.899 --> 02:15.300
I can't wait
to see tess the cheerleader/
engineering prodigy

02:15.302 --> 02:18.003
Become skyvolt,
the reluctant superhero

02:18.005 --> 02:21.673
Forced into the service
of mankind.

02:21.675 --> 02:25.344
Yeah. There really is a lot
going on with this character.

02:25.346 --> 02:28.647
I'm just a little bit nervous
about playing a superhero.

02:28.649 --> 02:32.384
Liv, look at my eyes.

02:32.386 --> 02:34.353
Oh.

02:34.355 --> 02:36.488
That is close.

02:36.490 --> 02:40.859
Skyvolt is a superhero
idolized by little girls
everywhere,

02:40.861 --> 02:44.396
Including this little girl,
who need the skyvolt comics

02:44.398 --> 02:47.699
To get her through
fifth grade and beyond.

02:47.701 --> 02:51.036
I don't mean
to put the pressure on you,

02:51.038 --> 02:54.740
But there's pressure
and it's on you.

02:56.510 --> 02:59.811
-Yeah, i know.
And i feel that pressure.
-Mmm.

02:59.813 --> 03:01.847
And i really want
to live up to it.

03:01.849 --> 03:05.484
I also feel my eyelashes move
every time you exhale.

Yo, liv, liv,
check it out.

04:05.446 --> 04:07.512
I just hung
your <i> voltage </i> poster.

04:07.514 --> 04:09.748
Please acknowledge
my baller hanging skills

04:09.750 --> 04:13.919
So i can go eat breakfast
like a boss.

04:13.921 --> 04:17.522
-Well, joey,
it looks amazing.
-Aw.

04:17.524 --> 04:20.425
But i would rather...

04:20.427 --> 04:24.062
See this!

04:24.064 --> 04:27.065
Bam! Champs!

04:27.067 --> 04:30.035
Aw! Liv.

04:30.037 --> 04:33.205
Wow.
Thank you so much.

04:33.207 --> 04:34.873
I am so not used to
all this attention

04:34.875 --> 04:36.508
That i'm getting
as state champ.

04:36.510 --> 04:38.744
Yeah, well,
you'd better get used to it,

04:38.746 --> 04:41.013
Because you're a big deal,
maddie.

04:41.015 --> 04:43.982
I mean, they asked you
to lead the homecoming parade.

04:43.984 --> 04:46.718
I know.
How cool is that?

04:46.720 --> 04:48.153
I know i'm jealous.

04:48.155 --> 04:51.089
You get to wear
a paulie the porcupine
<i>cabezudo.</i>

04:52.159 --> 04:55.961
Okay, so a <i> cabezudo</i>
is a giant parade head.

04:55.963 --> 04:58.463
I actually said no
to leading homecoming at first

04:58.465 --> 05:00.966
Because i thought
a <i> cabezudo </i> was one
of those creatures

05:00.968 --> 05:02.768
Who attacks goats
in mexico.

05:02.770 --> 05:05.003
That is a <i> chupacabra.</i>

05:05.005 --> 05:07.539
Yeah.
Turns out joey's knowledge
of dumb stuff

05:07.541 --> 05:09.107
Finally paid off.

05:09.109 --> 05:12.244
Yay! I'm useful.
Oh.

05:12.246 --> 05:15.514
Hey, you are crazy good
at crafts.

05:15.516 --> 05:17.516
Any chance that
you have time to help me

05:17.518 --> 05:19.551
Finish this paulie head
by tonight?

05:19.553 --> 05:21.520
I kind of need it
by tomorrow morning
for the parade.

05:21.522 --> 05:23.856
Oh, i thought
you would never ask!

05:23.857 --> 05:26.191
I mean, the best part
about shooting <i> voltage</i>
in stevens point

05:26.193 --> 05:28.794
Is so that we can have
sister moments like this.

05:28.796 --> 05:31.530
And brother moments too,
right?

05:35.069 --> 05:37.836
Yes!
Those as well.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.971
(laughs)
gotta go to set.

05:39.973 --> 05:41.206
Okay.

05:44.044 --> 05:47.612
All right, liv,
show me skyvolt.

05:47.614 --> 05:49.748
(gasps)

05:55.556 --> 06:00.525
My thought bubble
is speechless!

06:01.795 --> 06:04.529
Gemma, this suit
looks so awesome.

06:04.531 --> 06:07.199
Wait until you start
blasting electricity.

06:07.201 --> 06:10.736
We put air cannons
in the sleeves to give you
a nice kickback--

06:10.738 --> 06:12.871
Just a little
something-something
to make your powers look real.

06:12.873 --> 06:16.708
(gasps)
double "somethings."
i'm onboard.

06:16.710 --> 06:19.711
In this scene,
you're going
to split the branch

06:19.713 --> 06:21.012
And free the class president,

06:21.014 --> 06:23.582
Who doesn't want your help,
but needs it!

06:23.584 --> 06:26.685
Playing a superhero
is intimidating,

06:26.687 --> 06:29.654
But you don't want
to let down the millions
of little girls

06:29.656 --> 06:32.090
Waiting to see skyvolt
on tv.

06:32.092 --> 06:34.593
-(gasps)
-can you hear them?

06:34.595 --> 06:36.962
"inspire us, liv."

06:36.964 --> 06:39.598
-(gasps)
-"inspire us!"

06:42.202 --> 06:45.003
Oh, little girls,
i hear you.

06:45.005 --> 06:47.072
Skyvolt's coming!

06:48.909 --> 06:52.677
Let me see
your best lightning blast.

06:52.679 --> 06:55.647
Okay. Are you watching?
'cause it's gonna look great.

06:55.649 --> 06:56.748
(exhales)

06:57.818 --> 07:00.585
(steam hissing)

07:01.955 --> 07:05.657
Yeah. We are going
to have to work on that.

07:10.764 --> 07:13.198
<i>Olé!</i>

07:14.601 --> 07:17.002
Oh, we got a runner!
No, no.

07:17.004 --> 07:18.370
Man.

07:18.372 --> 07:21.072
What?
Whoa, dude!

07:21.074 --> 07:24.709
It's the gift card
that we gave mom and dad
for their anniversary.

07:24.711 --> 07:26.378
For our parents' 20th,

07:26.380 --> 07:30.048
We gave them a night
at the best restaurant
in stevens point.

07:30.050 --> 07:33.785
Both:
Goofy gary's fun zone!

07:33.787 --> 07:36.788
Foosball, bowling,
arcade games.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.356
And when
you order a burger,

07:38.358 --> 07:41.626
They serve it on
a souvenir frisbee.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.662
(sniffs)
ah!

07:43.664 --> 07:46.164
It smells like bacon grease
and excitement.

07:46.166 --> 07:48.200
They never went
to goofy gary's?

07:48.202 --> 07:50.635
Their anniversary
was, like, six months ago.

07:50.637 --> 07:52.637
Unbelievable, ungrateful!

07:52.639 --> 07:54.005
And a bunch
of other "un" words

07:54.007 --> 07:55.774
That i'm too livid
to remember right now!

07:55.776 --> 07:58.310
We need to teach them
a lesson,

07:58.312 --> 08:00.912
That if they
won't use this, we will.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.981
We can't do that.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.217
No, wait,
i want to do that.

08:05.219 --> 08:07.719
Please convince me
that we should do that.

08:07.721 --> 08:09.921
We take the gift card
to goofy gary's,

08:09.923 --> 08:12.657
Have the time of our lives,
then put the card back.

08:12.659 --> 08:15.227
Those ingrates
will never even know.

08:15.229 --> 08:17.963
Question-- how are
we teaching them a lesson

08:17.965 --> 08:19.831
If they don't know
that we did it?

08:19.833 --> 08:22.834
This is one of those lessons
you feel without knowing.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.402
They sting the worst.

08:24.404 --> 08:27.138
Solid logic, bro!

08:27.140 --> 08:28.773
Let's go!

08:28.775 --> 08:31.209
Both:

08:44.024 --> 08:45.991
What are you guys
up to?

08:45.993 --> 08:48.326
-Oh, well, we were just--
-wait, stop.

08:48.328 --> 08:50.362
Does this involve me
at all?

08:50.364 --> 08:52.230
-It does not.
-Then i do not care.

08:52.232 --> 08:54.099
Cool.

08:54.101 --> 08:57.035
Um, have either of you guys
heard from liv?

08:57.037 --> 08:58.904
Because she promised
that she was going

08:58.906 --> 09:01.172
To help me
with the paulie head,
but she's not home yet.

09:01.174 --> 09:05.076
Oh, joey, it sounds
like there might be
some hurt feelings going on.

09:05.078 --> 09:08.747
Maybe we should
set aside our plans
and have a chat with maddie.

09:10.117 --> 09:14.119
(both laughing)

09:14.121 --> 09:15.787
Ah, never.

09:15.789 --> 09:18.823
Could you imagine though?

09:22.829 --> 09:25.931
All right, liv,
blast that tree.

09:25.933 --> 09:28.199
And action!

09:31.004 --> 09:34.239
-Cut!
-(bell rings)

09:34.241 --> 09:36.675
How did that look?

09:36.676 --> 09:39.110
-Am i making
the air cannons work?
-The cannons look great.

09:39.112 --> 09:41.947
Yes! Okay.
How's my performance?

09:41.949 --> 09:43.949
Do i look
like a superhero?

09:43.951 --> 09:46.918
The cannons look great.

09:48.322 --> 09:51.122
No!
What am i doing wrong?

09:51.124 --> 09:53.858
Something's missing.

09:55.095 --> 09:59.097
I-- i want my thought bubble
to say, "wow!"

09:59.099 --> 10:03.001
Right now,
it says, "meh."

10:03.003 --> 10:06.404
Well, i want a "wow."

10:06.406 --> 10:08.406
I just don't know how.

10:08.408 --> 10:10.075
How do i wow?
Tell me now.

10:10.077 --> 10:13.311
Liv, look at my eyes.

10:13.313 --> 10:15.847
Oh, we're doing this again.

10:15.849 --> 10:19.818
Your performance
is like every superhero
i've ever seen.

10:19.820 --> 10:24.823
I want you
to be the superhero
i've never seen.

10:24.825 --> 10:28.059
And what is that exactly?

10:28.061 --> 10:30.829
I don't know.
I've never seen it.

10:32.065 --> 10:35.133

10:40.307 --> 10:43.141
That we only had to play
100 games of skee-ball

10:43.143 --> 10:45.377
To win
all of this cool stuff?

10:47.447 --> 10:49.547
It was nice goofy garying
with you.

10:49.549 --> 10:52.450
Hmm. The same to you, sir.
Bravo.

10:54.855 --> 10:57.922
Hey, munch, you forgot
to return your bowling shoes.

10:57.924 --> 11:01.126
Or did goofy gary's
give me awesome shoes

11:01.128 --> 11:03.495
In exchange
for my student id?

11:03.497 --> 11:05.063
Ha!

11:05.065 --> 11:08.066
Ah, i can feel the power
of hundreds of bowlers

11:08.068 --> 11:09.868
That have worn them
before me.

11:09.870 --> 11:12.871
Yeah, that's probably
a foot fungus.

11:12.873 --> 11:15.907
Either way,
i love them.

11:17.911 --> 11:20.945
Both:
Whoa! Skyvolt!

11:20.947 --> 11:22.947
That suit
is so cool!

11:22.949 --> 11:25.950
Now all you need
is superhero music
whenever you enter a room.

11:25.952 --> 11:28.053
Luckily for you,
i just won a musical
belt buckle.

11:28.055 --> 11:32.190
(beeps, plays stirring music)

11:33.927 --> 11:35.260
What are you two up to?

11:35.262 --> 11:37.962
-Okay,
don't tell anyone, but--
-wait!

11:37.964 --> 11:40.331
Stop.
Does this involve me at all?

11:40.333 --> 11:42.033
-It does not.
-Then i don't care.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.035
Cool.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.503
Have you guys
seen maddie?

11:45.505 --> 11:47.872
No. Why'd you get to
wear your skyvolt suit home?

11:47.874 --> 11:50.375
Ah, superhero homework.
(laughs)

11:50.377 --> 11:52.544
I'm just not really
figuring out my character,

11:52.546 --> 11:54.112
And i thought it would help
to practice

11:54.114 --> 11:56.414
With my super-power
air cannons.

11:59.953 --> 12:01.119
(sighs)

12:01.121 --> 12:03.288
Oh, no.

12:03.290 --> 12:05.557
Maddie finished
the porcupine head without me?

12:05.559 --> 12:08.560
Uh-huh, whatever.
Did you say air cannons?

12:11.965 --> 12:16.534
"liv,
couldn't wait any longer.
Had to get to bed. Maddie."

12:17.904 --> 12:20.238
I am the worst sister ever.

12:20.240 --> 12:23.675
(beeps, trombone plays
"wah-wah-wah")

12:23.677 --> 12:26.211
Ha!
I love this belt buckle!

12:30.183 --> 12:33.218
Okay,
thanks for letting us know.

12:33.220 --> 12:34.953
Goofy gary's just called.

12:34.955 --> 12:36.988
Oh! That dump by the mall

12:36.990 --> 12:41.626
Where the boys
got us a gift card
for our anniversary?

12:41.628 --> 12:44.295
Apparently, joey left
his student id there.

12:44.297 --> 12:47.565
Joey was at goofy gary's?
He can't afford to go there.

12:47.567 --> 12:50.602
Unless they used
our gift card.

12:50.604 --> 12:53.071
They stole
our anniversary gift

12:53.073 --> 12:56.341
That we didn't even want.
That is lower than low!

12:58.545 --> 13:01.079
This calls
for a hardcore punishment.

13:01.081 --> 13:03.081
-Mm-hmm.
-What do you think?

13:03.083 --> 13:05.116
Ooh, no screens
for a month.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.719
Two weeks of grounding.

13:07.721 --> 13:09.020
-Hmm.
-Ooh!

13:09.022 --> 13:12.991
Make them go
for an evening walk with us?

13:12.993 --> 13:14.959
Mmm.

13:14.961 --> 13:17.695
No, no,
i have something in mind

13:17.697 --> 13:20.064
That is worse than dinner
at goofy gary's.

13:20.066 --> 13:22.167
In fairness,
they do have good nachos.

13:22.169 --> 13:25.103
Oh, pete, barf.

13:26.573 --> 13:29.707
(sighs)
ready?

13:29.709 --> 13:32.143
Don't i look ready?

13:32.145 --> 13:35.113
Ooh.

13:35.115 --> 13:38.049
Hello, man.
Take that!

13:38.051 --> 13:40.518
(steam hissing)

13:42.355 --> 13:44.022
I went to goofy gary's

13:44.024 --> 13:46.324
And got beat up
by a superhero!

13:46.326 --> 13:49.160
Best day ever!

13:49.162 --> 13:50.662
(laughs)

13:50.664 --> 13:56.034
I am zaydock,
son of raydock!

13:57.070 --> 13:59.237
You'll never stop me,
skyvolt!

13:59.239 --> 14:01.139
Please, stop me, liv.

14:03.076 --> 14:05.276
Eat lightning, zaydock!

14:05.278 --> 14:07.078
(steam hissing)

14:08.715 --> 14:12.116
Both:
Our sister's skyvolt!
Out sister's skyvolt!

14:12.118 --> 14:15.053
Okay, you guys
are really big fans
of the comic.

14:15.055 --> 14:17.055
Honest answer,
how am i doing?

14:17.057 --> 14:20.191
Liv, you are doing great.

14:21.795 --> 14:25.396
Okay, well, joey,
your voice just went up,
like, six octaves.

14:25.398 --> 14:27.131
I can tell
that you're lying.

14:27.133 --> 14:29.300
(high voice)
what? Lying?

14:29.302 --> 14:31.502
No!

14:33.139 --> 14:36.207
It really is super high.

14:36.209 --> 14:39.043
Please don't sugarcoat it.
'cause i'm working
really hard.

14:39.045 --> 14:41.279
I'm just not getting it.

14:41.281 --> 14:43.615
Yeah, you ain't wrong,
girlfriend.

14:43.617 --> 14:46.050
You're making her
too heroic.

14:46.052 --> 14:48.119
I mean,
what's with the posing?

14:50.190 --> 14:53.691
I don't know why
this is so hard for me.

14:53.693 --> 14:56.394
I have never had
this much trouble
figuring out a character.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.196
Okay, well, see,
in the comic books,

14:58.198 --> 15:00.064
Skyvolt doesn't really want
to be a superhero.

15:00.066 --> 15:02.433
You know, she even tries
to get rid of her powers.

15:02.435 --> 15:06.337
Okay. So to be a superhero,

15:06.339 --> 15:10.775
I have to try
to not be a superhero?

15:10.777 --> 15:13.211
How do i do that?

15:13.213 --> 15:16.814
Duh!
By pretending.

15:16.816 --> 15:19.517
Oh.

15:19.519 --> 15:22.854
Good idea.
Let me pretend to blast you
into next week.

15:22.856 --> 15:24.622
(steam hissing)

15:26.259 --> 15:28.693
-Oh.
-No!

15:28.695 --> 15:32.196
Oh, no!
This is horrible!

15:32.198 --> 15:35.266
Maddie needs this
for the homecoming parade
tomorrow!

15:35.268 --> 15:37.335
Dang it! Now mom
is never going to let us

15:37.337 --> 15:39.637
Play with super powers
at the house.

15:46.179 --> 15:50.281
Liv. It's, like,
2:00 in the morning.

15:50.283 --> 15:51.549
What are you--

15:53.119 --> 15:55.286
My <i> cabezudo.</i>

15:55.288 --> 15:57.288
What happened?

15:57.290 --> 15:59.791
Maddie, i'm so sorry.

15:59.793 --> 16:02.226
I didn't make it home
in time to help you

16:02.228 --> 16:05.229
And then i ruined
your porcupine head.

16:05.231 --> 16:07.298
But it's going to be okay,
'cause i'm just going
to stay up all night

16:07.300 --> 16:08.733
And i'm gonna fix it.

16:08.735 --> 16:10.401
Liv, you can't
stay up all night,

16:10.403 --> 16:13.204
'cause you shoot your,
like, huge scene tomorrow.

16:13.206 --> 16:15.206
Don't even talk to me
about <i> voltage,</i>

16:15.208 --> 16:19.177
'cause it's just a mess.
But this i know i can fix.

16:19.179 --> 16:21.512
And if you don't lead
in that parade tomorrow,

16:21.514 --> 16:24.382
I am officially
the worst sister ever.

16:24.384 --> 16:27.285
How can you say that?

16:27.287 --> 16:31.456
Liv, you moved
an entire tv show
to stevens point

16:31.458 --> 16:33.858
Just so that you could
spend time with me.

16:33.860 --> 16:38.529
Yeah, but i feel like
i've already missed
a major sister moment.

16:38.531 --> 16:42.533
I know that you play
a superhero on tv,

16:42.535 --> 16:44.602
But i'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

16:44.604 --> 16:46.604
You're actually a human.

16:46.606 --> 16:48.940
(sighs)
i know.

16:48.942 --> 16:51.909
-I hate that.
-(both laugh)

16:51.911 --> 16:54.579
Well, we'll just, you know,
fix this together.

16:54.581 --> 16:57.615
We'll make this, like,
a major sister moment.

16:57.617 --> 17:00.184
I would love that.

17:00.186 --> 17:02.320
Thank you, maddie.

17:03.857 --> 17:06.324
Evening, twins.

17:06.326 --> 17:07.959
Why are you up so late?

17:07.961 --> 17:10.261
Oh, well, i couldn't
get comfortable in my bed.

17:10.263 --> 17:13.364
Then i realized,
i left my mattress
in the backyard.

17:16.236 --> 17:18.369
'night.

17:24.411 --> 17:25.910
(all chattering)

17:25.912 --> 17:29.414
Attention, people,
the floats are lined up
out front!

17:29.416 --> 17:31.616
Two minutes to parade time!

17:31.618 --> 17:33.751
(all cheering)

17:33.753 --> 17:35.286
Maddie's not even here.

17:35.288 --> 17:37.221
Are we going to do this
without our grand marshal?

17:37.223 --> 17:39.223
We're here! Hi!

17:39.225 --> 17:41.359
Ooh, we're here.

17:41.361 --> 17:43.961
Bam! What?

17:43.963 --> 17:46.431
-(laughs) thanks, liv!
-Yeah. And you know what?

17:46.433 --> 17:48.499
Even though we only got
20 minutes of sleep,

17:48.501 --> 17:50.902
I am so glad that we got
to build this together.

17:50.904 --> 17:54.939
Have a great parade, maddie!
(laughs)

17:54.941 --> 17:57.308
(snoring)

17:57.310 --> 18:00.311
Maddie? Maddie?

18:00.313 --> 18:02.280
-Maddie, wake up!
-I'm awake!

18:02.282 --> 18:04.449
Oh, i'm awake.
Why is it so dark?

18:04.451 --> 18:07.351
It's parade time, people.

18:07.353 --> 18:11.522
-(all cheering)
-porcupines, ho!

18:18.465 --> 18:22.333
Another full house.
Panda wins again.

18:22.335 --> 18:24.502
-Pete: Okay, boys!
-It's mom and dad!

18:24.504 --> 18:27.338
Hide the stuff,
hide the stuff,
hide the stuff!

18:30.510 --> 18:34.445
Oh.
What are you boys up to?

18:34.447 --> 18:35.746
-Nothing!
-Why?

18:35.748 --> 18:37.748
-We're not guilty
of anything!
-Nnnn.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.350
Kare-bear, look.

18:39.352 --> 18:42.286
Why, pete, look!

18:42.288 --> 18:45.690
It's the goofy gary's
gift card the boys gave us
for our anniversary.

18:45.692 --> 18:49.460
We have been looking
high and low for this.

18:49.462 --> 18:53.431
Both:
Uh-oh.

18:53.433 --> 18:56.400
You know what?
Let's all go to goofy gary's.

18:56.402 --> 18:59.537
(loud whispering)
we're done for.

18:59.539 --> 19:02.039
Just be cool
and we'll get out of this.

19:02.041 --> 19:06.777
You know that being cool
is not exactly my forte.

19:06.779 --> 19:10.948
Are you sure you want
to go to goofy gary's?

19:10.950 --> 19:14.819
I mean, word on the street
is that the food has gone
way downhill.

19:14.821 --> 19:18.756
I hear the wings
are of the pigeon variety.

19:20.760 --> 19:23.427
You know what?
When you go to goofy gary's,

19:23.429 --> 19:25.596
You're not exactly going
for the food.

19:25.598 --> 19:28.499
You're going
to make a memory
with your family

19:28.501 --> 19:30.368
That you will never forget.

19:30.370 --> 19:32.537
It's true.

19:32.539 --> 19:35.106
It's a magical place.

19:36.709 --> 19:40.511
Keep it together.

19:41.981 --> 19:44.348
What do you say, karen?

19:44.350 --> 19:47.518
I say...
<i>♪ goofy gary's for family fun ♪</i>

19:47.520 --> 19:50.454
<i>♪ the fun time there</i>
<i>is never done ♪</i>

19:50.456 --> 19:52.890
Both:
<i>♪ ah, fun, fun, fun, fun,</i>
<i>fun, fun, fun ♪</i>

19:52.892 --> 19:55.826
<i>♪ ah, fun, fun, fun,</i>
<i>fun, fun! ♪</i>

19:55.828 --> 19:57.061
Okay! Yeah, okay.

19:57.063 --> 19:59.597
Okay, we used
your gift card.

19:59.599 --> 20:03.100
And sure, yeah,
it was fun, fun, fun,
and fun, fun, fun.

20:03.102 --> 20:07.538
But it was so wrong,
wrong, wrong, wrong,
wrong, wrong, wrong.

20:07.540 --> 20:11.876
You two are going to work
to pay off what you spent,

20:11.878 --> 20:15.947
And then you're going
to take us to a restaurant
that   we want to go to.

20:15.949 --> 20:18.449
Ooh, can we go
to fast al's greasy food hut?

20:18.451 --> 20:20.851
Oh, pete, barf.

20:22.822 --> 20:26.390
Okay, liv,
this is skyvolt's big moment.

20:26.392 --> 20:27.491
Ready?

20:27.493 --> 20:30.494
Yeah.
I actually am.

20:30.496 --> 20:33.764
I realize that the key
to playing skyvolt

20:33.766 --> 20:35.433
Is understanding tess.

20:35.435 --> 20:38.569
You know,
she's just this normal
high-school girl

20:38.571 --> 20:40.871
Who's been given
enormous power.

20:40.873 --> 20:43.574
I think i was trying
to make skyvolt super human

20:43.576 --> 20:46.777
By focusing on the "super"
when i should have
been focusing,

20:46.779 --> 20:49.714
You know,
on the "human."

20:49.716 --> 20:51.582
That's great.

20:54.621 --> 20:58.489
But by "ready,"
i meant are you zipped up
in the back?

20:58.491 --> 21:02.493
(laughs) that!

21:02.495 --> 21:05.029
Yes, i'm ready.

21:05.031 --> 21:07.565
Just forget about
all that other stuff.

21:07.567 --> 21:09.900
-Okay.
-(bell rings)

21:09.902 --> 21:12.169
(cables whirring)

21:16.776 --> 21:18.476
Action!

21:18.478 --> 21:21.445
(grunting)

21:21.447 --> 21:25.516
(helicopter blades whirring)

21:37.830 --> 21:40.531
(grunting)

21:47.707 --> 21:49.507
(alarm beeping)

21:54.580 --> 21:57.648
(grunting)

22:04.657 --> 22:07.992
(panting)

22:20.273 --> 22:23.941
(all cheering)

22:23.943 --> 22:25.843
Oh, my sister
is a superhero!

22:25.845 --> 22:27.611
My sister is a superhero!

22:28.748 --> 22:31.949
Dude!
That was so awesome!

22:31.951 --> 22:33.951
I'm so proud of you.

22:33.953 --> 22:37.054
Liv, i had the prop department
build me something.

22:38.558 --> 22:40.658
"wow" is right.

22:40.660 --> 22:43.694
Gemma, thank you
so much for letting us
see a sneak peek.

22:43.696 --> 22:44.962
I gotta see it again!

22:44.964 --> 22:46.997
-I know!
-Parker, pass the remote.

22:46.999 --> 22:50.601
(steam hissing)

22:50.603 --> 22:54.572
I might have made myself
my own air cannons.

22:54.574 --> 22:57.942
Who wants popcorn?

22:59.212 --> 23:01.612
Ah!

23:01.614 --> 23:03.981
Boys:
<i>♪ fun, fun, fun, fun, fun! ♪</i>
