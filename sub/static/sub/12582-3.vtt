<b><font color="#0A7C32">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:48.201 --> 00:51.165
Do the new neighbors
have any kids my age?

00:51.201 --> 00:52.964
Joseph's getting too active.

00:53.002 --> 00:55.766
I need someone to sit
around and watch TV with.

00:55.805 --> 00:56.772
Stop it!

00:56.806 --> 00:59.434
No more families on the block!

00:59.476 --> 01:01.034
Look at those free weights.

01:01.077 --> 01:03.705
That's the sign of a fit,
single woman.

01:03.747 --> 01:07.148
She's tired of the bar scene
and is looking for a man

01:07.183 --> 01:09.481
to share her foosball table

01:09.519 --> 01:12.010
and beer can collection with.

01:12.055 --> 01:14.717
Now, Bobby, if a teenager moves
into that house,

01:14.758 --> 01:17.921
I'm counting on you to teach him
our community values.

01:17.961 --> 01:20.725
I know there's a lot of pressure
being the Block Captain's kid,

01:20.764 --> 01:22.732
but that was the life
you were born into.

01:22.766 --> 01:25.200
Hey, Country Bear Jamboree!

01:25.235 --> 01:27.203
My grandma send
me birthday check,

01:27.237 --> 01:28.898
but it not in my mailbox.

01:28.938 --> 01:30.303
Which one of you take it?

01:30.340 --> 01:32.069
Why would we steal your check?

01:32.108 --> 01:33.336
How do I know?!

01:33.376 --> 01:36.573
Maybe your wife needs
new pitchfork.

01:36.613 --> 01:39.207
I hope the new neighbor
isn't another Kahn.

01:39.249 --> 01:41.217
His cracks about
Peggy are funny,

01:41.251 --> 01:43.981
but other than that,
he's completely useless.

01:44.020 --> 01:47.512
Here comes the new neighbor.

01:47.557 --> 01:50.617
It <i>is</i> a lady!

01:50.660 --> 01:52.992
A big lady.

01:53.029 --> 01:53.996
It's a man.

01:54.030 --> 01:56.897
Oh, I didn't know
this was the type of neighborhood

01:56.933 --> 01:58.901
where guys stood
outside drinking beer.

01:58.935 --> 02:02.302
And I'm totally psyched, man!

02:02.338 --> 02:04.306
I'm totally psyched!

02:04.340 --> 02:06.001
Well, you should be psyched.

02:06.042 --> 02:08.602
You can drink in the alley
until 8:15 p.m.

02:08.645 --> 02:12.012
It's all in the block charter
which I left in your mailbox.

02:12.048 --> 02:14.414
Hank Hill, Block Captain.

02:14.450 --> 02:16.611
Nice to meet you.
I'm Willie Lane.

02:16.653 --> 02:19.918
Huh. Anybody ever tell you
that you've got the same name

02:19.956 --> 02:22.117
as a Dallas Cowboy
backup lineman

02:22.158 --> 02:25.025
from the 1976 to '79 seasons?

02:25.061 --> 02:26.028
No.

02:26.062 --> 02:27.427
Yep. "Big" Willie Lane.

02:27.463 --> 02:29.988
Blocked a kick
to beat the 49ers.

02:30.033 --> 02:33.298
Then was cut one year later
and moved down to Mexico

02:33.336 --> 02:36.635
where he now wrestles animals
for tourists' pennies.

02:36.673 --> 02:38.197
You sure about that, chief?

02:38.241 --> 02:39.208
Whoa, that's...

02:39.242 --> 02:41.608
that's a Super Bowl ring.

02:41.644 --> 02:43.612
Sweet Lord,
you're Big Willie Lane!

02:43.646 --> 02:44.670
Got dang, man.

02:44.714 --> 02:48.582
You're even better
than a single lady.

02:48.618 --> 02:49.585
Yay!

02:49.619 --> 02:52.520
I like this little
chicken chest.

02:52.555 --> 02:54.182
He's got spirit.

02:54.224 --> 02:55.191
Yay!

02:55.225 --> 02:56.590
Ow, my-my head.

02:56.626 --> 02:58.253
Look at him over there, Peggy.

02:58.294 --> 03:00.285
They never lose that nobility.

03:00.330 --> 03:02.924
Oh, God, he's coming this way.

03:02.966 --> 03:04.058
Just... just look casual.

03:04.100 --> 03:07.627
Hey, Hank!

03:07.670 --> 03:09.638
I thought you'd want
to see this.

03:09.672 --> 03:11.799
It's the football from
the kick I blocked.

03:11.841 --> 03:13.775
Looks just like it did on TV.

03:15.111 --> 03:17.079
Oh, uh, Willie,
this is my wife, Peggy.

03:17.113 --> 03:18.080
Hey...

03:18.114 --> 03:20.139
Didn't you used to be
one of our cheerleaders?

03:20.183 --> 03:21.810
Me? Oh, no.

03:21.851 --> 03:25.252
But I did go to a Cowboy's game
in 1978.

03:25.288 --> 03:28.155
Maybe you recognize me
from the stands.

03:28.191 --> 03:30.523
Dad, I changed my mind again.

03:30.560 --> 03:31.857
Medium rare.

03:31.895 --> 03:34.489
Think fast, big guy.

03:35.632 --> 03:36.599
Listen here, buddy.

03:36.633 --> 03:37.600
You have to catch it

03:37.634 --> 03:38.794
out in front with your hands,

03:38.835 --> 03:40.803
not try to cradle
it into your body.

03:40.837 --> 03:43.965
It's a little something
Billy Joe DuPree showed me.

03:44.007 --> 03:46.441
"Billy Joe Dupree."

03:46.476 --> 03:48.603
Way to go, Bobby.

03:48.645 --> 03:50.613
Now, you listen to
all the pointers

03:50.647 --> 03:51.671
this man gives you.

03:51.714 --> 03:53.875
He was taught about
football... and life...

03:53.917 --> 03:55.714
from the great Coach Landry.

03:55.752 --> 03:58.516
Hey, Hank,
there's a Cowboy's game on later

03:58.554 --> 03:59.554
if you want to come over.

03:59.555 --> 04:01.785
Okay, yeah, that sounds great.

04:01.824 --> 04:02.916
And you can bring the guys.

04:02.959 --> 04:05.120
They seem pretty cool.

04:05.161 --> 04:07.288
See, Peggy, I told you
the guys were cool.

04:11.334 --> 04:13.598
Run, damn it, run!

04:13.636 --> 04:15.729
No, don't go out of bounds!

04:15.772 --> 04:17.171
Wuss!

04:17.206 --> 04:19.538
Passion.

04:19.575 --> 04:20.541
Halftime.

04:20.576 --> 04:21.543
I'll grab a few brews.

04:21.577 --> 04:23.169
And, hey, if we do this again,

04:23.212 --> 04:25.703
would you guys mind bringing
Sam Adams instead of Alamo?

04:25.748 --> 04:29.149
No problem. I'll just dip into
my son's college fund.

04:29.185 --> 04:31.585
Guys, my uniform is too tight.

04:31.621 --> 04:33.589
You think Willie
would be offended

04:33.623 --> 04:34.590
if I took my pants off?

04:34.624 --> 04:36.990
Got dang it, Bill,
don't screw this up.

04:37.026 --> 04:41.588
Hey, you guys want to see
some stuff from my career?

04:41.631 --> 04:42.689
Hank, you've seen this.

04:42.732 --> 04:45.428
It's the football
from that kick I blocked.

04:45.468 --> 04:49.871
Oh... and here's a picture
from that kick I blocked.

04:49.906 --> 04:50.873
Hey, Willie,

04:50.907 --> 04:54.741
I have something I think
you'd be interested in.

04:54.777 --> 04:56.938
Well, who's that handsome stud?

04:56.980 --> 04:59.608
That's you before
the weight gain.

04:59.649 --> 05:00.638
Hey, Willie,

05:00.683 --> 05:03.345
how'd you feel about letting me
borrow your Super Bowl ring

05:03.386 --> 05:06.412
to wear to Ladies Night
at Shananigans tomorrow?

05:06.456 --> 05:08.321
Bill, game room.
Now.

05:08.358 --> 05:11.725
Can I have some more chips,

05:11.761 --> 05:14.093
or would that be stepping
over the line, too?

05:14.130 --> 05:15.097
Five! Four!
Three! Two! One!

05:15.131 --> 05:17.031
We did it!
Cowboys win!

05:21.337 --> 05:23.464
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

05:23.506 --> 05:24.996
Cowboys win!

05:25.041 --> 05:26.406
Hey, Bob, what's up, brother?

05:30.446 --> 05:33.347
Huh. Willie specifically said,
"Come over for the game."

05:34.784 --> 05:36.752
Boomhauer, are we
overstaying our welcome

05:36.786 --> 05:38.378
if we watch
the post game show?

05:38.421 --> 05:41.618
Mmm. Well... toss-up, man.

05:41.657 --> 05:43.750
Oh, God. The post
game show's starting.

05:43.793 --> 05:44.760
What do we do?

05:44.794 --> 05:46.955
Well, it's our first time
at Willie's.

05:46.996 --> 05:48.964
We don't want to come on
too strong.

05:48.998 --> 05:49.965
Got dang,

05:49.999 --> 05:52.524
I think that's Jethro Pugh.

05:52.568 --> 05:54.195
As God is my witness,

05:54.237 --> 05:56.762
if I ever get back
inside that house,

05:56.806 --> 05:59.468
I'm never going to leave.

06:03.846 --> 06:05.905
One good thing
about other hillbillies...

06:05.948 --> 06:08.382
at least they all pass out
by 9:00.

06:08.418 --> 06:11.182
This guy need to shut up
or get stronger moonshine.

06:11.220 --> 06:14.712
Then call him to lower
music, but be nice.

06:14.757 --> 06:16.019
Maybe when we go on vacation,

06:16.059 --> 06:18.254
we finally have someone
to feed your stupid fish.

06:18.294 --> 06:24.062

your neighbor,

06:29.605 --> 06:30.970

06:31.007 --> 06:32.975
Would you please lower
Bad Company?

06:33.009 --> 06:34.772
Candy, climb on down.

06:34.811 --> 06:37.644
I'm going to take care
of this situation.

06:37.680 --> 06:39.648
Oh, Minh,
I think I'm getting somewhere.

06:39.682 --> 06:41.775
Now, which one are you, pardner?

06:41.818 --> 06:44.048
You right across the alley?

06:44.087 --> 06:45.054
Yeah, that me.

06:45.088 --> 06:46.919
He's coming to apologize.

06:46.956 --> 06:47.980
That's a start.

06:48.024 --> 06:51.460
Right on. So, your house
has the phone cord

06:51.494 --> 06:53.758
running right by the side
of the house?

06:53.796 --> 06:56.492

that matter, but...

be very sexy.

07:16.152 --> 07:17.119
Well, sorry to be a tease,

07:17.153 --> 07:19.246
but I just made
a one-time exemption.

07:19.288 --> 07:22.280
Really? Then I want the fine
rescinded from my game night.

07:22.325 --> 07:24.293
Well, Peggy,
the appeals process...

07:24.327 --> 07:25.294
Oh, my God.

07:25.328 --> 07:28.354
Kahn's hassling Willie.

07:33.002 --> 07:35.163
Uh-oh, you in for it now,
big boy.

07:35.204 --> 07:37.672
The Block Captain
never stand for nonsense.

07:37.707 --> 07:40.870
Hank, he cut my phone cable.

07:40.910 --> 07:41.934
Yeah, right.

07:41.978 --> 07:43.070
You're... dumb.

07:43.112 --> 07:45.706
Kahn, please tell me you're
not going to run over here

07:45.748 --> 07:49.047
and blame Willie every time
a phone call gets disconnected.

07:49.085 --> 07:50.609
Right on, Double-H.

07:50.653 --> 07:51.620
Right on.

07:51.654 --> 07:52.882
I am not lying!

07:52.922 --> 07:54.890
Now listen,
you make my family follow

07:54.924 --> 07:56.357
your stupid rules all the time.

07:56.392 --> 07:58.917
So shut down this jock ball.

07:58.961 --> 08:00.519
It's a school night.

08:00.563 --> 08:03.657
Hey, Double-H, I'll bet
a Cowboy fan like you

08:03.699 --> 08:07.760
would love to meet
Roger Staubach's pool cleaner.

08:07.803 --> 08:09.100
He's in there? Now?

08:09.138 --> 08:11.698
Well, yeah,
he's a buddy of mine.

08:11.741 --> 08:12.833
Come on in and meet him.

08:12.875 --> 08:15.605
Uh... I wouldn't know
what to say.

08:15.645 --> 08:17.408
He's very easy to talk to.

08:17.446 --> 08:19.937
Now, get on in there.

08:19.982 --> 08:21.643
Hank, I need you!

08:21.684 --> 08:23.174
Hank...

08:23.219 --> 08:25.517
Block Captain.

08:35.498 --> 08:36.760
I cannot believe

08:36.799 --> 08:39.289
you met Roger Staubach's
pool cleaner.

08:39.335 --> 08:41.428
Yup. We played foosball.

08:41.470 --> 08:42.437
He's a great guy.

08:42.471 --> 08:44.439
Just a regular guy,
I tell you what.

08:44.473 --> 08:45.701
Hey, Hank Hill,

08:45.741 --> 08:46.741
I gave your block charter

08:46.776 --> 08:47.970
to Connie to take to school

08:48.010 --> 08:49.910
for report on hypocrisy.

08:49.946 --> 08:55.714
She get an "A,"
and teacher call you a monster.

08:55.751 --> 08:56.775
So what kind of haircut

08:56.819 --> 08:58.514
did the pool
cleaner have, huh?

08:58.554 --> 09:01.387
Was he a redhead? I'm
picturing a redhead.

09:01.424 --> 09:03.790
Willie's giving me
some blocking lessons later.

09:03.826 --> 09:06.124
He says I'd make
a great lineman,

09:06.162 --> 09:07.493
like he was.

09:07.530 --> 09:10.522
My son is getting a clinic
from a Dallas Cowboy.

09:10.566 --> 09:13.364
I've always said you had
a lot of untapped bulk.

09:13.402 --> 09:16.098
I'm going to do a push-up!

09:16.138 --> 09:19.232
Which one of you
sports fans wants

09:19.275 --> 09:22.972
to give old Willie
a ride to work?

09:23.012 --> 09:24.309
How about you, Double H?

09:24.347 --> 09:25.405
Excuse me, guys.

09:25.448 --> 09:28.679
Official Cowboy business.

09:41.731 --> 09:43.096
And that's how
I blocked that kick.

09:43.132 --> 09:45.692
That story gets better
every time you tell it.

09:45.735 --> 09:47.703
Hey, thanks for the lift
to work.

09:47.737 --> 09:50.069
I'm probably still legally drunk
from my party.

09:51.107 --> 09:52.267
Yeah, uh, you know, Willie,

09:52.308 --> 09:55.402
I've been meaning to talk to you
about that party.

09:55.444 --> 09:57.412
Uh, I know
you haven't had a chance

09:57.446 --> 09:58.811
to read the block charter yet,

09:58.848 --> 10:01.442
but, uh, it did go on
a little late.

10:01.484 --> 10:03.782
I hear you, chief.

10:03.819 --> 10:06.049
But it's hard for me
to go to bars.

10:06.088 --> 10:07.055
There's always one guy

10:07.089 --> 10:09.057
who wants to prove
how tough he is

10:09.091 --> 10:11.389
by taking on
an ex-football player.

10:11.427 --> 10:13.019
That's why I party at home.

10:13.062 --> 10:16.054
If I get in a fight,
at least it's with a friend.

10:16.098 --> 10:17.087
Very responsible.

10:17.133 --> 10:19.966
Hey, Hank,
you're a big Cowboy fan.

10:20.002 --> 10:23.062
How would you like to buy
Deion Sander's truck?

10:23.105 --> 10:26.131
I'll give you
the "friend's price."

10:26.175 --> 10:27.142
Oh, wow.

10:27.176 --> 10:29.076
Well, I-I mean, it's
a great opportunity,

10:29.111 --> 10:31.136
but I don't really
need another truck.

10:31.180 --> 10:33.444
Hank, thanks for the lift.

10:33.482 --> 10:34.574
Rock on.

10:34.617 --> 10:36.448
Rock on.

10:38.054 --> 10:40.386
Hurry, Switzer.

10:40.423 --> 10:43.085
You can do it.

10:43.125 --> 10:44.319
There you go.

10:44.360 --> 10:45.327
Uh...

10:45.361 --> 10:46.350
Willie, I know

10:46.395 --> 10:48.124
Kahn's a pain in the neck,

10:48.164 --> 10:51.930
but this isn't really how
we do things around here,

10:51.967 --> 10:54.367
and even Kahn
never walks his dog

10:54.403 --> 10:56.098
on anybody else's lawn.

10:56.138 --> 10:57.332
I hear you, brother.

10:57.373 --> 10:59.364
I just lost my
head for a second.

10:59.408 --> 11:00.875
Oh, dang.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.468
I forgot my baggie.

11:02.511 --> 11:05.309
I'll run home and grab one.

11:05.348 --> 11:06.315
Come on, Switzer.

11:06.349 --> 11:07.316
Come on, girl.

11:07.350 --> 11:13.448
Hank, how much

11:13.489 --> 11:14.581
longer are you going to stare

11:14.623 --> 11:17.091
at that big pile
of dog droppings?

11:17.126 --> 11:18.525
Not much longer.

11:18.561 --> 11:20.756
It's only been
a couple of hours.

11:20.796 --> 11:22.821
I'm sure he just forgot.

11:24.533 --> 11:28.469
I guess I'll just
go pick it up myself.

11:33.576 --> 11:35.635
Hey, Hank, Willie called <i>me</i>

11:35.678 --> 11:38.613
and asked <i>me</i>
to give him a ride home

11:38.647 --> 11:42.208
and to thank <i>me,</i> he gave <i>me</i>

11:42.251 --> 11:43.377
the "friend's price"

11:43.419 --> 11:48.186
on Cowboy legend Deion
"Prime Time" Sanders' Hyundai.

11:48.224 --> 11:50.192
Now, help me push it
into my garage.

11:50.226 --> 11:54.959
Dad, check out
what Willie taught me.

11:56.265 --> 11:59.428
Now who's your daddy, huh?

11:59.468 --> 12:01.333
Big Willie Lane!

12:01.370 --> 12:04.533
Bobby, what are you doing?

12:04.573 --> 12:05.801
That's cheating.

12:05.841 --> 12:09.004
Willie says it ain't cheating

12:09.044 --> 12:12.172
if you don't get caught.

12:12.214 --> 12:14.114
That's not true.

12:14.150 --> 12:17.950
Well, what the heck
happened here?

12:17.987 --> 12:22.151
Your new pig-headed,
jock friend dug holes in my lawn.

12:23.192 --> 12:25.319
Lawn-scape assault is
in clear violation

12:25.361 --> 12:27.261
of article nine
of the charter.

12:28.230 --> 12:29.197
This ends today.

12:29.231 --> 12:34.760
Mister, you
are out of control,

12:34.804 --> 12:36.567
and it's time you get in line.

12:36.605 --> 12:38.573
You know, I used to think
you were a cool guy.

12:38.607 --> 12:43.510
I can be <i>very</i> cool when someone
follows our neighborhood guidelines.

12:43.546 --> 12:44.513
Now get over there

12:44.547 --> 12:46.640
and start helping
Kahn fill those holes.

12:57.593 --> 13:00.221
You know, Hank, you seem
to have a lot of spirit.

13:00.262 --> 13:02.127
How would you like a pep rally?

13:02.164 --> 13:04.496
Hey, we could make a bonfire!

13:04.533 --> 13:08.629
No, don't...
Stop that!

13:08.671 --> 13:15.304
All right, that does it!

13:17.112 --> 13:19.672
So these guys started a fire
in the alley

13:19.715 --> 13:23.617
and tore some planks
off my fence.

13:23.652 --> 13:25.916
You do realize that
this is a felony.

13:30.693 --> 13:31.682
Sweet Betty,

13:31.727 --> 13:33.922
that's a Super Bowl ring!

13:33.963 --> 13:36.056
McMurtry, get your keister
over here.

13:36.098 --> 13:37.497
I'm Willie Lane.

13:37.533 --> 13:39.501
It's nice to
meet you officers.

13:39.535 --> 13:42.095
This is the guy who
blocked that kick.

13:42.137 --> 13:44.503
Uh, Officers Brown
and McMurtry,

13:44.540 --> 13:46.565
there's the matter
of the fire here...

13:46.609 --> 13:48.941
Hey, let me try that Super
Bowl ring on, will you?

13:48.978 --> 13:54.075
Last time that thing was off
was 500 beers ago.

13:55.117 --> 13:56.084
Officers, uh, about the fire.

13:56.118 --> 13:58.086
Willie, you didn't start
this fire, did you?

13:58.120 --> 13:59.087
He probably did it,

13:59.121 --> 14:03.922
and now he's trying
to pin it on me.

14:03.959 --> 14:06.894
You guys can't possibly
believe him. The man...

14:06.929 --> 14:07.896
Enough out of you.

14:07.930 --> 14:08.897
Now get back inside

14:08.931 --> 14:10.660
and stop hassling Big Willie.

14:10.699 --> 14:15.932
Hey, if we kicked
a few footballs,

14:15.971 --> 14:18.940
could you block 'em?

14:18.974 --> 14:24.207
All right, you snap and kick.

14:30.619 --> 14:32.644
Dad, can I have a
ride to the store?

14:32.688 --> 14:33.950
Willie borrowed my bike

14:33.989 --> 14:36.321
and seems
to have lost track of it.

14:36.358 --> 14:37.325
Chug! Chug! Chug!

14:37.359 --> 14:42.058
You know, for a guy who was a pro
athlete, Willie's drunk a lot.

14:42.097 --> 14:43.792
Yeah, I know, Bobby.

14:43.832 --> 14:46.528
Have you thought about where
we're going to move to?

14:46.569 --> 14:49.060
I heard Tampa's nice.

14:49.104 --> 14:50.662
We're not moving anywhere.

14:54.510 --> 15:02.383
I got you in my sights.

15:02.418 --> 15:08.379
I'm going to pack,
just in case.

15:11.627 --> 15:12.924
Hank?

15:12.962 --> 15:14.452
Kahn,

15:14.496 --> 15:16.327
I'm sorry
I didn't believe you.

15:16.365 --> 15:19.823
No man should have to live
to see <i>this</i> done to his lawn.

15:19.868 --> 15:21.961
So I was thinking
we could work together

15:22.004 --> 15:23.198
to get rid of Willie.

15:23.238 --> 15:25.229
I talked to my
father-in-law last night.

15:25.274 --> 15:27.708
He knows a guy who
will do it for 5,000.

15:27.743 --> 15:30.337
Kahn, I'll only operate
within the confines

15:30.379 --> 15:32.506
of state law
and the block charter.

15:32.548 --> 15:34.516
Incoming!

15:36.318 --> 15:37.342
You sure about this?

15:37.386 --> 15:39.684
Because maybe we
can get hitman to throw in Gribble

15:39.722 --> 15:41.713
as freebie.

15:49.398 --> 15:52.925
We mow in two minutes, Kahn.

15:53.936 --> 15:55.801
What do you think
you're doing?

15:55.838 --> 15:57.863
Willie's sleeping
off a hangover.

15:57.906 --> 15:59.897
That's exactly what I figured.

15:59.942 --> 16:01.876
Kahn and I are going
to fire up our mowers

16:01.910 --> 16:04.242
every day at 7:00 a.m.,

16:04.279 --> 16:07.544
the earliest time for mowing
permitted in the block charter.

16:07.583 --> 16:09.813
Eventually it'll drive
that hungover bastard

16:09.852 --> 16:11.342
off the block.

16:11.387 --> 16:14.618
Over Bill's bruised
and lacerated body, you will.

16:14.657 --> 16:16.625
Lay down in front
of the mower, Bill.

16:16.659 --> 16:18.024
Okay.

16:18.060 --> 16:19.493
What happened to you guys?

16:19.528 --> 16:20.825
Bill, don't you remember

16:20.863 --> 16:22.831
when this was
the kind of neighborhood

16:22.865 --> 16:24.833
where you could leave
your door unlocked at night,

16:24.867 --> 16:26.892
and no one would steal
your refrigerator?

16:26.935 --> 16:28.835
I've been keeping my food
in the tub.

16:28.871 --> 16:31.965
And Dale, you believed
in the block charter so strongly

16:32.007 --> 16:34.168
you signed it
with your real name.

16:34.209 --> 16:37.144
It's the only time
I've ever done that.

16:37.179 --> 16:42.708
Gentlemen, it is a new morning
on Rainey Street.

17:05.574 --> 17:06.563
It's not working.

17:06.608 --> 17:08.165
Time for Plan B.

17:08.210 --> 17:09.472
There's a plan B?

17:09.511 --> 17:15.006
We didn't tell you
for your own protection.

17:16.719 --> 17:19.517
They wouldn't dare have
their basket-bottle tournament

17:19.555 --> 17:22.115
with Deion Sanders' car
in the way.

17:22.156 --> 17:24.954
They were going to make me dance
during halftime.

17:24.992 --> 17:26.358
We can't play bottle donkey

17:26.395 --> 17:29.558
with that car in our court.

17:29.598 --> 17:30.860
Hey, Fitzy,

17:30.899 --> 17:35.962
Tom, Tommy, Jack, Joe, Bear!

17:36.605 --> 17:38.698
Oh, what the?

17:38.741 --> 17:43.542
Deion's car!

17:45.414 --> 17:47.041
Hank, your lawn!

17:47.082 --> 17:49.414
I know, Bill, I know,

17:49.451 --> 17:52.181
but I think Willie just tossed
his last car

17:52.221 --> 17:56.555
on his last neighbor's lawn.

17:56.592 --> 17:59.720
Why would I tip a car
over on my own lawn?

17:59.762 --> 18:01.093
I don't know.

18:01.130 --> 18:02.358
It puzzles me.

18:02.397 --> 18:04.092
But Willie says
he didn't do it,

18:04.133 --> 18:06.601
and we have no evidence that
proves otherwise.

18:06.635 --> 18:08.193
Uh, Willie, this here's

18:08.237 --> 18:10.762
Officers Collins and Winchell.

18:11.707 --> 18:12.901
They're off duty

18:12.941 --> 18:14.772
but came by because
they wanted to meet you.

18:14.810 --> 18:16.437
Could we check out
that Super Bowl ring?

18:16.478 --> 18:18.036
This little old thing?

18:18.080 --> 18:19.138
Sure.

18:19.181 --> 18:20.546
Hey! Let's take
a group picture.

18:20.582 --> 18:26.384
McMurtry, grab the Polaroid.

18:26.421 --> 18:30.414
Hey, I used to have
a camera like that.

18:30.459 --> 18:32.290
It must have gotten lost
in the move.

18:32.327 --> 18:35.160
Well, here, take this one.

18:35.197 --> 18:36.129
All units,

18:36.165 --> 18:40.033
310 in progress
at 250 Arroyo Grande.

18:40.068 --> 18:43.196
Please respond.

18:43.939 --> 18:47.602
Heh! Little help.

18:49.578 --> 18:52.479
Help?! I help you get
the hell out of my neighborhood,

18:52.514 --> 18:56.041
you big fat, muscle-headed load
of rat-jackal-pig-dog-waste!

18:58.921 --> 19:00.513
You just called me a pig?

19:00.556 --> 19:02.683
Oh, you don't like that?

19:02.724 --> 19:05.158
Well, I don't care anymore!

19:05.194 --> 19:06.161
I don't sleep.

19:06.195 --> 19:08.163
My career is going
in the toilet.

19:08.197 --> 19:09.164
My little girl can't study.

19:09.198 --> 19:11.325
And all because
some fat, jock slob

19:11.366 --> 19:14.199
play a little football
and block a kick!

19:14.236 --> 19:15.203
I don't even know
what it means

19:15.237 --> 19:16.295
to block a kick,

19:16.338 --> 19:19.432
but if you can do it,
then any idiot can do it!

19:19.474 --> 19:21.135
Back off.

19:21.176 --> 19:24.304
We don't fight on this block.

19:27.916 --> 19:30.817
Kill him, Hank!
Bill's got your back!

19:30.853 --> 19:31.820
No, Dale.

19:31.854 --> 19:33.822
If I hit him back,
it's a fight.

19:33.856 --> 19:35.414
Right now, it's assault.

19:35.457 --> 19:37.687
Ain't nobody going
to believe you, chief.

19:37.726 --> 19:39.523
Bear, you see me hit this guy?

19:39.561 --> 19:42.496
Yeah. L-I mean, no.
He-he tried to rob you.

19:42.531 --> 19:44.328
Oh, you did so hit Hank.

19:44.366 --> 19:45.924
Just look at his poor face.

19:45.968 --> 19:46.935
A big bruise

19:46.969 --> 19:49.437
and the words
"sallad syobwoc." Huh?

19:49.471 --> 19:55.967
That's weird.

19:57.512 --> 19:59.412
Looks like Willie
just hung himself.

19:59.448 --> 20:02.884
Kahn, take a picture.

20:02.918 --> 20:04.647
Good thinking, Hank.

20:04.686 --> 20:12.686
Now we got evidence.

20:14.897 --> 20:16.592
Dale, put it in
your wall safe!

20:16.632 --> 20:22.593
Squirrel tactic!

20:32.547 --> 20:33.946
Now, listen here.

20:33.982 --> 20:36.849
No one else in this town
has a Super Bowl ring,

20:36.885 --> 20:39.319
so that picture
is proof of assault.

20:39.354 --> 20:40.480
Assault? It...

20:40.522 --> 20:44.754
Willie can't afford
another assault charge, pardner.

20:44.793 --> 20:46.624
That'd be totally uncool.

20:46.662 --> 20:49.153
Then you've got two weeks
to get out of that house

20:49.197 --> 20:50.687
and off our block.

20:50.732 --> 20:52.791
I'm gonna need more time
than that.

20:52.834 --> 20:56.099
The charter clearly states
that when a neighbor is deposed,

20:56.138 --> 20:58.333
they get two weeks
to get off the block.

20:58.373 --> 21:02.469
And that's all you're getting.

21:15.357 --> 21:16.984
Thank you, Hank Hill.

21:17.025 --> 21:18.322
Here.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.661
- Yep.
- Yep.

21:19.695 --> 21:23.995
- Yep.
- Mm-hmm.

21:24.032 --> 21:27.433
In my experience, a lot of
people say they gonna hit you,

21:27.469 --> 21:28.697
but not many actually do it.

22:00.050 --> 22:05.050
