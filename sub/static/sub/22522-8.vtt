00:54.984 --> 00:59.819
SAGAN: <i>We are drifting in</i>
<i>a great ocean of space and time.</i>

01:01.524 --> 01:04.425
<i>In that ocean, the events</i>
<i>that shape the future...</i>

01:04.627 --> 01:07.027
<i>... are working themselves out.</i>

01:09.232 --> 01:12.565
<i>Each creature and every world,</i>
<i>to the remotest star...</i>

01:12.769 --> 01:14.669
<i>... owe their existence to...</i>

01:14.871 --> 01:17.704
<i>... the great, coursing,</i>
<i>implacable forces of nature...</i>

01:17.907 --> 01:21.035
<i>... but also, to minor happenstance.</i>

01:23.580 --> 01:26.845
<i>We are carried with our planet</i>
<i>around the sun.</i>

01:27.050 --> 01:30.486
<i>The Earth has made more than</i>
<i>4 billion circuits of our star...</i>

01:30.687 --> 01:32.518
<i>... since its origin.</i>

01:34.557 --> 01:38.459
<i>The sun itself travels about</i>
<i>the core of the Milky Way galaxy.</i>

01:38.661 --> 01:41.289
<i>Our galaxy is moving</i>
<i>among the other galaxies.</i>

01:41.498 --> 01:44.865
<i>We have always been space travelers.</i>

01:46.669 --> 01:51.538
These fine sand grains are all,
more or less, uniform in size.

01:52.442 --> 01:55.673
They're produced from bigger rocks
through ages of...

01:55.879 --> 01:59.713
...jostling and rubbing,
abrasion and erosion.

01:59.916 --> 02:03.784
Driven in part by
the distant moon and sun.

02:04.120 --> 02:07.681
So the roots of the present
lie buried in the past.

02:07.891 --> 02:11.657
We are also travelers in time.

02:16.132 --> 02:17.360
<i>But trapped on Earth...</i>

02:17.567 --> 02:20.900
<i>... we've had little to say about</i>
<i>where we go in time and space...</i>

02:21.104 --> 02:22.469
<i>... or how fast.</i>

02:22.672 --> 02:26.403
<i>But now we're thinking</i>
<i>about true journeys in time...</i>

02:26.609 --> 02:30.511
<i>... and real voyages</i>
<i>to the distant stars.</i>

02:32.282 --> 02:36.878
A handful of sand contains
about 10,000 grains...

02:37.086 --> 02:39.281
...more than all the stars
we can see...

02:39.489 --> 02:41.821
...with the naked eye
on a clear night.

02:42.025 --> 02:44.118
But the number of stars we can see...

02:44.327 --> 02:47.922
...is only the tiniest fraction
of the number of stars that are.

02:48.731 --> 02:51.757
What we see at night
is the merest smattering...

02:51.968 --> 02:53.936
...of the nearest stars...

02:54.137 --> 02:58.403
...with a few more distant bright
stars thrown in for good measure.

02:58.608 --> 03:02.476
Meanwhile, the cosmos
is rich beyond measure.

03:02.679 --> 03:04.806
<i>The number of stars</i>
<i>in the universe...</i>

03:05.014 --> 03:08.347
<i>... is larger than all the grains</i>
<i>of sand on all the beaches...</i>

03:08.551 --> 03:10.143
<i>... of the planet Earth.</i>

03:14.023 --> 03:18.824
<i>Long ago, before we had figured out</i>
<i>that the stars are distant suns...</i>

03:19.028 --> 03:22.156
<i>... they seemed to us</i>
<i>to make pictures in the sky.</i>

03:22.365 --> 03:25.163
<i>Just follow the dots.</i>

03:26.469 --> 03:29.632
<i>The Big Dipper constellation</i>
<i>today in North America...</i>

03:29.839 --> 03:32.000
<i>... has had many other incarnations.</i>

03:32.208 --> 03:34.472
<i>Every culture, ancient and modern...</i>

03:34.744 --> 03:38.510
<i>... has placed its totems</i>
<i>and concerns among the stars.</i>

03:38.715 --> 03:42.708
<i>From a Chinese bureaucrat</i>
<i>to a German wagon.</i>

03:46.756 --> 03:50.556
<i>But very ancient cultures would have</i>
<i>seen different constellations...</i>

03:50.760 --> 03:54.059
<i>... because the stars move</i>
<i>with respect to one another.</i>

03:54.264 --> 03:59.031
<i>We can give a computer the present</i>
<i>positions and motions of stars...</i>

03:59.235 --> 04:02.932
<i>... and then run the patterns</i>
<i>back into time.</i>

04:04.941 --> 04:08.638
<i>Every constellation is a single frame</i>
<i>in a cosmic movie...</i>

04:08.845 --> 04:11.211
<i>... but because our lives</i>
<i>are so short...</i>

04:11.414 --> 04:13.405
<i>... because star patterns</i>
<i>change slowly...</i>

04:13.616 --> 04:16.551
<i>... we tend not to notice</i>
<i>it's a movie.</i>

04:16.753 --> 04:20.553
<i>A million years ago,</i>
<i>there was no Big Dipper.</i>

04:20.957 --> 04:24.256
<i>Our ancestors, looking up</i>
<i>and wondering about the stars...</i>

04:24.460 --> 04:28.089
<i>... saw some other pattern</i>
<i>in the northern skies.</i>

04:29.132 --> 04:33.501
<i>We can also run a constellation,</i>
<i>Leo the Lion, say, forward in time...</i>

04:33.703 --> 04:37.605
<i>... and see what the patterns</i>
<i>in the stars will be in the future.</i>

04:39.375 --> 04:41.775
<i>A million years from now,</i>
<i>Leo might be renamed...</i>

04:41.978 --> 04:44.674
<i>... the constellation</i>
<i>of the Radio Telescope.</i>

04:44.881 --> 04:48.180
<i>Although I suspect radio telescopes</i>
<i>then will be as obsolete...</i>

04:48.384 --> 04:50.284
<i>... as stone spears are now.</i>

04:50.486 --> 04:54.513
<i>Or, here's the constellation</i>
<i>of Cetus the Whale.</i>

05:03.533 --> 05:08.266
<i>A million years ago, it may have</i>
<i>been called something else.</i>

05:08.471 --> 05:09.961
<i>Perhaps the Spear.</i>

05:15.078 --> 05:19.606
<i>Now, let's run fast-forward</i>
<i>through a billion nights.</i>

05:24.754 --> 05:26.381
<i>Millions of years from now...</i>

05:26.589 --> 05:30.787
<i>... some other very different image</i>
<i>will be featured in this cosmic movie.</i>

05:38.735 --> 05:41.761
<i>In Orion the Hunter,</i>
<i>things are changing...</i>

05:41.971 --> 05:43.905
<i>... not only because</i>
<i>the stars are moving...</i>

05:44.107 --> 05:46.871
<i>... but also because</i>
<i>the stars are evolving.</i>

05:47.076 --> 05:50.637
<i>Many of Orion's stars are</i>
<i>hot, young and short-lived.</i>

05:50.847 --> 05:54.908
<i>They're born, live and die within</i>
<i>a span of only a few million years.</i>

05:55.118 --> 05:57.951
<i>If we run Orion forward in time...</i>

05:58.154 --> 06:00.987
<i>... we see the births</i>
<i>and explosive deaths...</i>

06:01.190 --> 06:02.714
<i>... of dozens of stars...</i>

06:02.925 --> 06:07.055
<i>... flashing on and winking off</i>
<i>like fireflies in the night.</i>

06:09.499 --> 06:13.026
<i>If we wait long enough,</i>
<i>we see the constellations change.</i>

06:13.236 --> 06:17.172
<i>But if we go far enough,</i>
<i>we also see the star patterns alter.</i>

06:17.373 --> 06:19.238
<i>Two-dimensional constellations...</i>

06:19.442 --> 06:23.435
<i>... are only the appearance of stars</i>
<i>strewn through three dimensions.</i>

06:23.646 --> 06:27.946
<i>Some are dim and near,</i>
<i>others are bright but farther away.</i>

06:29.185 --> 06:31.517
<i>Could a space traveler</i>
<i>actually see...</i>

06:31.721 --> 06:34.417
<i>... the patterns of</i>
<i>the constellations change?</i>

06:34.624 --> 06:39.493
<i>For that, you must travel roughly as</i>
<i>far as the constellation is from us.</i>

06:39.962 --> 06:42.988
<i>Here, we're traveling</i>
<i>hundreds of light-years...</i>

06:43.199 --> 06:47.499
<i>... circling all the way around</i>
<i>the stars of the Big Dipper.</i>

06:51.040 --> 06:53.167
<i>Inhabitants of planets</i>
<i>around other stars...</i>

06:53.376 --> 06:55.810
<i>... will see different constellations</i>
<i>than us...</i>

06:56.012 --> 06:58.981
<i>... because their vantage points</i>
<i>are different.</i>

07:07.056 --> 07:10.719
Here we are
in the constellation Andromeda...

07:10.927 --> 07:15.728
...or at least a model of it
next to the constellation Perseus.

07:15.932 --> 07:18.093
Andromeda, in the Greek myth...

07:18.301 --> 07:22.101
...was the maiden
who was saved by Perseus...

07:22.305 --> 07:24.239
...from a sea monster.

07:24.440 --> 07:29.343
This star just above me
is Beta Andromedae...

07:29.545 --> 07:32.173
...the second brightest star
in the constellation...

07:32.381 --> 07:35.544
...75 light-years from the Earth.

07:35.752 --> 07:38.846
The light by which we see this star...

07:39.055 --> 07:43.185
...has spent 75 years
traversing interstellar space...

07:43.392 --> 07:45.383
...on its journey to the Earth.

07:45.595 --> 07:49.190
In the unlikely event
that Beta Andromedae...

07:49.398 --> 07:51.923
...blew itself up
a week ago Tuesday...

07:52.135 --> 07:54.899
...we will not know of it
for another 75 years...

07:55.104 --> 07:59.097
...as this interesting information,
traveling at the speed of light...

07:59.308 --> 08:02.937
...crosses the enormous
interstellar distances.

08:03.146 --> 08:05.637
When the light we see
from this star set out...

08:05.848 --> 08:08.578
...on its long
interstellar voyage...

08:08.785 --> 08:11.345
...the young Albert Einstein...

08:11.554 --> 08:14.421
...working as a Swiss patent clerk...

08:14.624 --> 08:18.526
...had just published his epochal
special theory of relativity...

08:18.728 --> 08:20.059
...here on Earth.

08:20.930 --> 08:22.158
We see...

08:22.365 --> 08:26.495
...that space and time
are intertwined.

08:26.702 --> 08:29.569
We cannot look out into space...

08:29.772 --> 08:33.071
...without looking back into time.

08:33.342 --> 08:36.436
The speed of light is very fast...

08:36.646 --> 08:39.843
...but space is very empty...

08:40.049 --> 08:43.348
...and the stars are very far apart.

08:43.553 --> 08:46.681
The distances that we've been
talking about up to now...

08:46.889 --> 08:50.689
...are very small
by the usual astronomical standards.

08:50.893 --> 08:53.521
In fact, the distance
from the Earth...

08:53.729 --> 08:55.720
...to the center
of the Milky Way galaxy...

08:55.932 --> 08:58.799
...is 30,000 light-years.

08:59.769 --> 09:04.706
From our galaxy to the nearest
spiral galaxy like our own...

09:05.041 --> 09:06.838
...called M31...

09:07.043 --> 09:09.944
...and which is also within,
that means behind...

09:10.146 --> 09:12.114
...the constellation Andromeda...

09:12.849 --> 09:16.580
...is 2 million light-years.

09:17.820 --> 09:21.017
When the light we see today
from M31...

09:21.224 --> 09:23.749
...left on its journey for Earth...

09:23.960 --> 09:25.894
...there were no human beings...

09:26.095 --> 09:29.394
...although our ancestors
were nicely evolving...

09:29.599 --> 09:32.659
...and very rapidly,
to our present form.

09:33.336 --> 09:35.827
There are much greater distances
in astronomy.

09:36.038 --> 09:39.633
The distance from the Earth
to the most distant quasars...

09:39.842 --> 09:43.278
...is 8 or 10 billion light-years.

09:43.479 --> 09:48.178
We see them as they were before
the Earth itself accumulated...

09:48.384 --> 09:51.945
...before the Milky Way galaxy
was formed.

09:52.154 --> 09:55.783
The fastest space vehicles ever
launched by the human species...

09:55.992 --> 09:57.926
...are the <i>Voyager</i> spacecraft.

09:58.127 --> 09:59.822
They are traveling so fast...

10:00.029 --> 10:03.624
...that it's only
10,000 times slower...

10:04.133 --> 10:05.430
...than the speed of light.

10:05.635 --> 10:08.263
The <i>Voyager</i> spacecraft
will take 40,000 years...

10:08.471 --> 10:10.530
...to go the distance
to the nearest stars...

10:10.740 --> 10:13.937
...and they're not even headed
towards the nearest stars.

10:14.143 --> 10:16.737
<i>But is there a method</i>
<i>by which we could travel...</i>

10:16.946 --> 10:20.438
<i>... in a conveniently short time</i>
<i>to the stars?</i>

10:20.650 --> 10:23.483
<i>Can we travel close</i>
<i>to the speed of light?</i>

10:23.686 --> 10:26.416
<i>And what's magic</i>
<i>about the speed of light?</i>

10:26.622 --> 10:29.216
<i>Can't we travel faster than that?</i>

10:31.227 --> 10:35.061
<i>It turns out that</i>
<i>there is something very strange...</i>

10:35.264 --> 10:36.731
<i>... about the speed of light.</i>

10:36.933 --> 10:38.992
<i>Something that provides the key...</i>

10:39.201 --> 10:42.602
<i>... to our understanding</i>
<i>of time and space.</i>

10:44.340 --> 10:46.035
<i>The story of its discovery...</i>

10:46.242 --> 10:49.837
<i>... takes us to Tuscany</i>
<i>in northern Italy.</i>

10:52.148 --> 10:54.582
<i>There's something timeless</i>
<i>about this place.</i>

10:54.784 --> 10:58.447
<i>A century ago, it probably</i>
<i>looked very much the same.</i>

11:10.566 --> 11:14.764
<i>If you had traveled these roads</i>
<i>in the summer of 1895...</i>

11:14.971 --> 11:19.101
<i>... you might have come upon a
<i>16-year-old German high-school dropout.</i></i>

11:19.308 --> 11:22.471
<i>His teacher told him that</i>
<i>he'd never amount to anything...</i>

11:22.678 --> 11:26.136
<i>... that his attitude destroyed</i>
<i>classroom discipline...</i>

11:26.349 --> 11:28.078
<i>... that he should drop out.</i>

11:28.284 --> 11:30.275
<i>So he left and came here...</i>

11:30.486 --> 11:32.920
<i>... where he enjoyed</i>
<i>wandering these roads...</i>

11:33.122 --> 11:35.590
<i>... and giving his mind</i>
<i>free rein to explore.</i>

11:37.593 --> 11:40.061
<i>One day, he began</i>
<i>to think about light...</i>

11:40.262 --> 11:42.253
<i>... about how fast it travels.</i>

11:42.465 --> 11:45.525
<i>We always measure</i>
<i>the speed of a moving object...</i>

11:45.735 --> 11:47.703
<i>... relative to something else.</i>

11:47.903 --> 11:51.930
<i>I'm moving at about 10 kilometers</i>
<i>an hour relative to the ground.</i>

11:52.141 --> 11:53.768
<i>But the ground isn't at rest.</i>

11:53.976 --> 11:57.742
<i>The Earth is turning at more</i>
<i>than 1600 kilometers an hour.</i>

11:57.947 --> 12:00.415
<i>The Earth itself is</i>
<i>in orbit around the sun.</i>

12:00.616 --> 12:04.677
<i>The sun is moving among</i>
<i>the drifting stars, and so on.</i>

12:04.887 --> 12:08.288
<i>It was hard for the young man</i>
<i>to imagine some absolute standard...</i>

12:08.491 --> 12:11.358
<i>... to measure all these</i>
<i>relative motions against.</i>

12:21.170 --> 12:25.038
<i>He knew that sound waves are</i>
<i>a vibration of the air...</i>

12:25.241 --> 12:28.404
<i>... and their speed is measured</i>
<i>relative to the air itself.</i>

12:28.611 --> 12:31.808
<i>But sunlight travels across</i>
<i>the vacuum of empty space.</i>

12:32.014 --> 12:34.278
<i>"Do light waves move</i>
<i>relative to something else?</i>

12:34.483 --> 12:38.078
<i>And if so," he wondered,</i>
<i>"relative to what?"</i>

12:41.624 --> 12:45.754
That teenage dropout's name...

12:46.429 --> 12:48.090
...was Albert Einstein.

12:48.297 --> 12:51.232
And his ruminations changed the world.

12:56.572 --> 13:00.702
He had been fascinated
by Bernstein's 1869...

13:01.577 --> 13:05.172
<i>... People's Book of Natural Science.</i>

13:05.381 --> 13:08.544
Here, on its very first page...

13:09.418 --> 13:13.548
...it describes the astonishing speed
of electricity through wires...

13:13.889 --> 13:15.823
...and light through space.

13:16.158 --> 13:20.094
Einstein wondered, perhaps for
the first time, in northern Italy...

13:20.863 --> 13:25.061
...what the world would look like if
you could travel on a wave of light.

13:25.634 --> 13:27.829
To travel at the speed of light.

13:28.037 --> 13:32.838
What an engaging and magical thought
for a teenage boy on the road...

13:33.042 --> 13:36.910
...where the countryside is dappled
and rippling in sunlight.

13:47.923 --> 13:52.326
You couldn't tell you were on a light
wave if you were traveling with it.

13:52.528 --> 13:55.156
If you started on a wave crest...

13:55.364 --> 14:00.165
...you would stay on the crest and
lose all notion of it being a wave.

14:00.369 --> 14:05.204
Something funny happens
at the speed of light.

14:35.804 --> 14:39.570
The more Einstein thought about it,
the more troubling it became.

14:39.775 --> 14:42.335
Paradoxes seemed to pop up all over...

14:42.545 --> 14:44.513
...if you could travel
at the speed of light.

14:44.713 --> 14:48.114
Certain ideas had been
accepted as true...

14:48.317 --> 14:50.785
...without sufficiently
careful thought.

14:52.922 --> 14:56.949
<i>One of those ideas had to do</i>
<i>with the light from a moving object.</i>

14:58.427 --> 15:01.658
<i>The images by which we see the world</i>
<i>are made of light...</i>

15:01.864 --> 15:03.991
<i>... and are carried</i>
<i>at the speed of light...</i>

15:04.200 --> 15:07.465
<i>... 300,000 kilometers a second.</i>

15:08.070 --> 15:11.870
<i>You might think that the image of me</i>
<i>should be moving out ahead of me...</i>

15:12.074 --> 15:15.305
<i>... at the speed of light</i>
<i>plus the speed of the bicycle.</i>

15:15.511 --> 15:19.038
<i>If I'm moving towards you</i>
<i>faster than a horse-and-cart...</i>

15:19.248 --> 15:22.217
<i>... then my image should be</i>
<i>approaching you that much faster.</i>

15:22.418 --> 15:25.012
<i>My image ought to arrive earlier.</i>

15:27.156 --> 15:29.681
<i>But in reality</i>
<i>you don't see any time delay.</i>

15:30.125 --> 15:33.993
<i>In a near collision, for example,</i>
<i>you see everything happen at once.</i>

15:34.196 --> 15:37.859
<i>Horse, cart, swerve, bicycle.</i>
<i>All simultaneous.</i>

15:38.601 --> 15:42.560
<i>But how would it look if</i>
<i>it were proper to add the velocities?</i>

15:42.771 --> 15:46.207
<i>Since I'm heading toward you, you'd</i>
<i>add my speed to the speed of light.</i>

15:46.408 --> 15:51.175
<i>So my image ought to arrive before</i>
<i>the image of the horse-and-cart.</i>

15:52.081 --> 15:54.572
<i>I'd be cycling towards you</i>
<i>quite normally.</i>

15:54.783 --> 15:58.275
<i>To me, a collision</i>
<i>would seem imminent.</i>

15:58.487 --> 16:01.388
<i>But you'd see me swerve</i>
<i>for no apparent reason...</i>

16:01.590 --> 16:03.922
<i>... and have a collision with nothing.</i>

16:04.960 --> 16:07.758
<i>Now, the horse-and-cart</i>
<i>aren't headed towards you.</i>

16:07.963 --> 16:11.694
<i>Their image would arrive only</i>
<i>at the speed of light.</i>

16:12.434 --> 16:15.028
<i>Could it seem to me that</i>
<i>I just missed colliding...</i>

16:15.571 --> 16:18.131
<i>... while to you it wasn't even close?</i>

16:18.340 --> 16:20.501
<i>In precise laboratory experiments...</i>

16:20.709 --> 16:23.837
<i>... scientists have never observed</i>
<i>any such thing.</i>

16:24.446 --> 16:26.812
If the world is to be understood...

16:27.149 --> 16:32.052
...if we are to avoid logical paradoxes
when traveling at high speeds...

16:32.254 --> 16:34.779
...then there are rules
which must be obeyed.

16:34.990 --> 16:39.723
Einstein called these rules
the special theory of relativity.

16:39.928 --> 16:42.453
Light from a moving object
travels at the same speed...

16:42.665 --> 16:46.294
...no matter whether the object
is at rest or in motion.

16:46.502 --> 16:51.166
"Thou shalt not add my speed
to the speed of light."

16:51.373 --> 16:56.208
Also, no material object can travel
at or beyond the speed of light.

16:56.412 --> 17:00.473
Nothing in physics prevents you from
traveling close to the speed of light.

17:00.683 --> 17:04.483
99.9 percent the speed of light
is just fine.

17:04.687 --> 17:07.053
But no matter how hard you try...

17:07.256 --> 17:10.020
...you can never gain
that last decimal point.

17:10.225 --> 17:12.489
For the world
to be logically consistent...

17:12.695 --> 17:15.823
...there must be a cosmic speed limit.

17:16.598 --> 17:19.294
<i>The crack of a whip is,</i>
<i>due to its tip...</i>

17:19.501 --> 17:21.492
<i>... moving faster</i>
<i>than the speed of sound.</i>

17:24.139 --> 17:25.367
<i>It makes a shock wave...</i>

17:25.574 --> 17:29.408
<i>... a small sonic boom</i>
<i>in the Italian countryside.</i>

17:29.611 --> 17:31.943
<i>A thunderclap has a similar origin.</i>

17:32.147 --> 17:35.480
<i>So does the sound of</i>
<i>a supersonic airplane.</i>

17:37.519 --> 17:42.081
<i>So why is the speed of light a barrier</i>
<i>any more than the speed of sound?</i>

17:42.291 --> 17:44.156
<i>The answer is not just that...</i>

17:44.360 --> 17:46.954
<i>... light travels a million times</i>
<i>faster than sound.</i>

17:47.162 --> 17:50.825
<i>It's not merely an engineering problem</i>
<i>like the supersonic airplane.</i>

17:51.400 --> 17:55.461
<i>Instead, the light barrier is</i>
<i>a fundamental law of nature...</i>

17:55.671 --> 17:57.571
<i>... as basic as gravity.</i>

17:57.773 --> 18:01.140
<i>Einstein found his absolute framework</i>
<i>for the world:</i>

18:01.343 --> 18:05.712
<i>This sturdy pillar among all</i>
<i>the relative motions of the cosmos.</i>

18:05.914 --> 18:09.975
<i>Light travels just as fast,</i>
<i>no matter how its source is moving.</i>

18:10.185 --> 18:14.212
<i>The speed of light is constant,</i>
<i>relative to everything else.</i>

18:14.423 --> 18:17.722
<i>Nothing can ever catch up with light.</i>

18:20.696 --> 18:24.223
Einstein's prohibition against
traveling faster than light...

18:24.433 --> 18:27.163
...seems to clash with
our common sense notions.

18:27.369 --> 18:30.167
But why should we expect
our common sense notions...

18:30.372 --> 18:33.273
...to have any reliability
in a matter of this sort?

18:33.475 --> 18:37.343
Why should our experience
at 10 kilometers an hour...

18:37.546 --> 18:39.741
...constrain the laws of nature...

18:39.948 --> 18:43.247
...at 300,000 kilometers a second?

18:45.487 --> 18:48.081
Relativity sets limits...

18:48.290 --> 18:51.350
...on what humans ultimately can do.

18:51.894 --> 18:54.522
The universe is not required...

18:54.730 --> 18:59.099
...to be in perfect harmony
with human ambition.

19:02.571 --> 19:05.472
Imagine a place
where the speed of light...

19:05.674 --> 19:09.041
...isn't its true value
of 300,000 kilometers a second...

19:09.244 --> 19:11.804
...but something a lot less.

19:12.014 --> 19:15.415
Let's say, 40 kilometers an hour...

19:15.617 --> 19:17.676
...and strictly enforced.

19:18.587 --> 19:22.489
<i>Just as in the real world we can</i>
<i>never reach the speed of light...</i>

19:22.691 --> 19:24.556
<i>... the commandment here is still...</i>

19:24.760 --> 19:28.093
<i>..."Thou shalt not travel</i>
<i>faster than light."</i>

19:28.297 --> 19:32.791
<i>We can do thought experiments on</i>
<i>what happens near the speed of light...</i>

19:33.001 --> 19:37.335
<i>... here 40 kilometers per hour,</i>
<i>the speed of a motor scooter.</i>

19:40.676 --> 19:44.669
<i>You can't break the laws of nature.</i>
<i>There are no penalties for doing so.</i>

19:45.047 --> 19:46.912
<i>The real world and this one...</i>

19:47.249 --> 19:51.379
<i>... are merely so arranged</i>
<i>that transgressions can't happen.</i>

19:51.587 --> 19:55.523
<i>The job of physics is to find out</i>
<i>what those laws are.</i>

19:57.860 --> 20:00.829
<i>Before Einstein,</i>
<i>physicists thought that...</i>

20:01.029 --> 20:03.429
<i>... there were privileged frames</i>
<i>of reference...</i>

20:03.632 --> 20:06.123
<i>... some special places and times...</i>

20:06.335 --> 20:08.895
<i>... against which everything else</i>
<i>had to be measured.</i>

20:09.104 --> 20:12.471
<i>Einstein encountered</i>
<i>a similar notion in human affairs.</i>

20:12.674 --> 20:15.370
<i>The idea that the customs</i>
<i>of a particular nation...</i>

20:15.577 --> 20:19.138
<i>... his native Germany</i>
<i>or Italy or anywhere...</i>

20:19.348 --> 20:23.284
<i>... are the standard which all</i>
<i>other societies must be measured.</i>

20:24.152 --> 20:27.588
<i>But Einstein rejected the strident</i>
<i>nationalism of his time.</i>

20:27.789 --> 20:30.883
<i>He believed every culture</i>
<i>had its own validity.</i>

20:31.093 --> 20:33.027
<i>Also in physics,</i>
<i>he understood that...</i>

20:33.228 --> 20:35.492
<i>... there are no privileged</i>
<i>frames of reference.</i>

20:35.697 --> 20:38.825
<i>Every observer,</i>
<i>in any place, time or motion...</i>

20:39.034 --> 20:41.662
<i>... must deduce</i>
<i>the same laws of nature.</i>

20:41.870 --> 20:43.770
(SPEAKING IN ITALIAN)

20:45.307 --> 20:49.141
<i>A speed is simply how much space</i>
<i>you cover in a given time...</i>

20:49.344 --> 20:52.006
<i>... as any kid on</i>
<i>a motor scooter knows.</i>

20:55.450 --> 20:57.315
<i>Since near the velocity of light...</i>

20:57.519 --> 21:00.010
<i>... we cannot simply add speeds...</i>

21:00.222 --> 21:03.851
<i>... the familiar notions of</i>
<i>absolute space and absolute time...</i>

21:04.059 --> 21:07.051
<i>... independent of your</i>
<i>relative motion, must give way.</i>

21:07.262 --> 21:09.822
<i>That's why, as Einstein showed...</i>

21:10.032 --> 21:13.991
<i>... funny things have to happen</i>
<i>close to the speed of light.</i>

21:14.736 --> 21:18.570
<i>There, our conventional perspectives</i>
<i>of space and time...</i>

21:18.774 --> 21:20.833
<i>... strangely change.</i>

21:23.278 --> 21:27.214
Your nose is just a little closer
to me than your ears.

21:27.416 --> 21:29.646
Light reflected off your nose
reaches me...

21:29.851 --> 21:32.081
...an instant in time
before your ears.

21:32.287 --> 21:35.518
But suppose I had a magic camera...

21:35.724 --> 21:38.716
...so that I could see
your nose and your ears...

21:38.927 --> 21:40.895
...at precisely the same instant?

21:41.096 --> 21:42.563

21:42.764 --> 21:44.231
(SCOOTER HONKS)

21:44.433 --> 21:48.870
<i>With such a camera you could take</i>
<i>some pretty interesting pictures.</i>

21:50.238 --> 21:53.639
<i>Paolo says goodbye to</i>
<i>his little brother, Vincenzo...</i>

21:54.009 --> 21:56.102
<i>- Ciao,</i> Vincenzo.
<i>- Ciao,</i> Paolo.

21:56.912 --> 21:58.539
<i>... and rides off.</i>

21:58.747 --> 22:01.272
<i>He's now going more than</i>
<i>half the speed of light.</i>

22:01.483 --> 22:04.043
<i>He is almost catching up</i>
<i>with his own light waves.</i>

22:04.252 --> 22:06.812
<i>This compresses the light waves</i>
<i>in front of him...</i>

22:07.022 --> 22:08.751
<i>... and his image becomes blue.</i>

22:09.057 --> 22:12.754
<i>The shorter wavelength is</i>
<i>what makes blue light waves blue.</i>

22:13.328 --> 22:17.059
<i>Also Paolo becomes skinny</i>
<i>in the direction of motion.</i>

22:17.265 --> 22:19.324
<i>This isn't just some optical illusion.</i>

22:19.534 --> 22:22.765
<i>It really happens when you travel</i>
<i>near the speed of light.</i>

22:23.538 --> 22:27.872
<i>As he roars away, he leaves his own</i>
<i>light waves stretched out behind him.</i>

22:28.076 --> 22:29.441
<i>Long light waves are red.</i>

22:29.645 --> 22:33.206
<i>We say that his receding image</i>
<i>is red-shifted.</i>

22:34.783 --> 22:39.447
<i>Now Paolo leaves for</i>
<i>a short tour of the countryside.</i>

22:39.888 --> 22:43.415
<i>He experiences something</i>
<i>even stranger.</i>

22:46.028 --> 22:48.258
<i>Everything he can see is squeezed...</i>

22:48.463 --> 22:50.829
<i>... into a moving window</i>
<i>just ahead of him...</i>

22:51.033 --> 22:54.434
<i>... blue-shifted at the center,</i>
<i>red-shifted at the edges.</i>

22:54.636 --> 22:57.935
<i>To a passerby, Paolo appears</i>
<i>blue-shifted when approaching...</i>

22:58.140 --> 22:59.869
<i>... red-shifted when receding.</i>

23:00.075 --> 23:03.135
<i>But to him, the entire world</i>
<i>is both coming and going...</i>

23:03.345 --> 23:05.074
<i>... at nearly the speed of light.</i>

23:05.280 --> 23:08.909
<i>Roadside houses and trees</i>
<i>that has already gone past...</i>

23:09.117 --> 23:12.553
<i>... still appear to him at the edge</i>
<i>of his forward field of view...</i>

23:12.754 --> 23:15.450
<i>... but distorted and red-shifted.</i>

23:16.625 --> 23:20.356
<i>When he slows down,</i>
<i>everything again looks normal.</i>

23:21.897 --> 23:24.263
<i>Only very close</i>
<i>to the speed of light...</i>

23:24.466 --> 23:28.061
<i>... does the visible world</i>
<i>get squeezed into a kind of tunnel.</i>

23:28.970 --> 23:32.428
<i>You'd see these distortions if you</i>
<i>traveled near the speed of light.</i>

23:32.641 --> 23:35.337
<i>Someday, perhaps,</i>
<i>interstellar navigators...</i>

23:35.544 --> 23:38.069
<i>... will take their bearings</i>
<i>on stars behind them...</i>

23:38.280 --> 23:42.774
<i>... whose images have all crowded</i>
<i>together on the forward view screen.</i>

23:45.053 --> 23:48.181
<i>The most bizarre aspect of traveling</i>
<i>near the speed of light...</i>

23:48.390 --> 23:50.984
<i>... is that time slows down.</i>

23:51.827 --> 23:54.125
<i>All clocks,</i>
<i>mechanical and biological...</i>

23:54.329 --> 23:57.127
<i>... tick more slowly</i>
<i>near the speed of light.</i>

23:57.332 --> 24:00.665
<i>But stationary clocks tick</i>
<i>at their usual rate.</i>

24:00.869 --> 24:03.030
<i>If we travel close to light speed...</i>

24:03.238 --> 24:06.332
<i>... we age more slowly</i>
<i>than those we left behind.</i>

24:11.780 --> 24:14.613
<i>Paolo's watch and his internal</i>
<i>sense of time show...</i>

24:15.150 --> 24:18.677
<i>... that he has been gone from</i>
<i>his friends for only a few minutes.</i>

24:19.187 --> 24:23.453
<i>But from their point of view,</i>
<i>he has been away for many decades.</i>

24:23.658 --> 24:27.253
<i>His friends have grown up,</i>
<i>moved on and died.</i>

24:28.230 --> 24:29.857
<i>And his younger brother has been...</i>

24:30.065 --> 24:33.398
<i>... patiently waiting</i>
<i>for him all this time.</i>

24:35.537 --> 24:40.474
<i>The two brothers experience</i>
<i>the paradox of time dilation.</i>

24:40.675 --> 24:44.372
<i>They've encountered</i>
<i>Einstein's special relativity.</i>

24:45.413 --> 24:46.380
Vincenzo.

25:00.262 --> 25:02.696
<i>This was just a thought experiment.</i>

25:02.898 --> 25:06.061
<i>But atomic particles traveling</i>
<i>near the speed of light...</i>

25:06.268 --> 25:09.465
<i>... do decay more slowly</i>
<i>than stationary particles.</i>

25:09.671 --> 25:12.868
<i>As strange and counterintuitive</i>
<i>as it seems...</i>

25:13.074 --> 25:16.339
<i>... time dilation is a law of nature.</i>

25:18.213 --> 25:21.011
Traveling close
to the speed of light...

25:21.316 --> 25:24.217
...is a kind of elixir of life.

25:25.187 --> 25:28.281
Because time slows down
close to the speed of light...

25:28.490 --> 25:31.357
...special relativity provides us...

25:31.560 --> 25:34.256
...with a means of going to the stars.

25:35.297 --> 25:38.494
This region of northern Italy
is not only the cauldron...

25:38.700 --> 25:41.999
...of some of the thinking
of the young Albert Einstein...

25:42.337 --> 25:45.670
...it is also the home
of another great genius...

25:45.874 --> 25:48.172
...who lived 400 years earlier.

25:48.376 --> 25:50.674
Leonardo da Vinci.

25:51.947 --> 25:56.316
Leonardo delighted
in climbing these hills...

25:56.518 --> 25:59.885
...and viewing the ground
from a great height...

26:00.088 --> 26:02.386
...as if he were soaring like a bird.

26:02.591 --> 26:05.185
He drew the first aerial views...

26:05.393 --> 26:09.090
...of landscapes, villages,
fortifications.

26:09.564 --> 26:13.500
I've been talking about Einstein
in and around this town of Vinci...

26:13.702 --> 26:15.863
...in which Leonardo grew up.

26:16.071 --> 26:19.131
Einstein greatly respected Leonardo...

26:19.341 --> 26:22.003
...and their spirits, in some sense...

26:22.210 --> 26:25.509
...inhabit this countryside still.

26:50.472 --> 26:53.532
Among Leonardo's
many accomplishments...

26:53.742 --> 26:57.109
...in painting, sculpture,
architecture, natural history...

26:57.312 --> 27:01.749
...anatomy, geology,
civil and military engineering...

27:02.250 --> 27:04.115
...he had a great passion.

27:04.352 --> 27:07.844
He wished to construct a machine...

27:08.056 --> 27:09.717
...which would fly.

27:10.258 --> 27:14.058
He made sketches of such machines,
built miniature models...

27:14.262 --> 27:18.392
...constructed great,
full-scale prototypes.

27:20.201 --> 27:23.864
And not a one of them ever worked.

27:25.073 --> 27:29.442
There were no machines of adequate
capacity available in his time.

27:29.644 --> 27:33.011
The technology was just not ready.

27:33.915 --> 27:37.146
The designs, however, were brilliant.

27:37.352 --> 27:40.515
For example, this bird-like machine...

27:40.722 --> 27:44.715
...here in the Leonardo Museum
in the town of Vinci.

27:45.894 --> 27:50.831
Leonardo's great designs encouraged
engineers in later epochs...

27:51.032 --> 27:55.401
...although Leonardo himself
was very depressed at these failures.

27:55.603 --> 27:57.434
But it's not his fault...

27:57.639 --> 28:00.665
...he was trapped in the 15th century.

28:01.509 --> 28:05.206
A somewhat similar case
occurred in 1939...

28:05.413 --> 28:09.747
...when a group of engineers called
the British Interplanetary Society...

28:09.951 --> 28:12.215
...decided to design a ship...

28:12.420 --> 28:15.389
...which would carry people
to the moon.

28:15.590 --> 28:17.888
Now, it was by no means
the same design...

28:18.093 --> 28:22.757
...as the <i>Apollo</i> ship which actually
took people to the moon years later.

28:22.964 --> 28:25.524
But that design suggested that...

28:25.734 --> 28:27.531
...a mission to the moon
might one day...

28:27.736 --> 28:30.330
...be a practical
engineering possibility.

28:30.805 --> 28:31.999
Today...

28:33.008 --> 28:36.637
...we have preliminary
designs of ships...

28:36.845 --> 28:40.042
...which will take people
to the stars.

28:40.248 --> 28:44.947
They are constructed in Earth orbit
and from there...

28:45.153 --> 28:50.090
...they venture on their great
interstellar journeys.

28:50.458 --> 28:51.857
One of them...

28:52.327 --> 28:55.319
...is called Project <i>Orion.</i>

28:56.464 --> 28:58.398
It utilizes nuclear weapons...

28:58.600 --> 29:03.037
...hydrogen bombs
against an inertial plate.

29:03.238 --> 29:06.969
Each explosion providing
a kind of "putt-putt"...

29:07.175 --> 29:11.111
...a vast nuclear motorboat in space.

29:11.513 --> 29:14.949
<i>Orion</i> seems entirely practical...

29:15.150 --> 29:17.584
...and was under development
in the U. S...

29:17.786 --> 29:21.153
...until the signing
of the international treaty...

29:21.356 --> 29:24.553
...forbidding nuclear weapons
explosions in space.

29:25.160 --> 29:30.097
<i>I think, the</i> Orion <i>starship</i>
<i>is the best use of nuclear weapons...</i>

29:30.298 --> 29:34.132
<i>... provided the ships don't depart</i>
<i>from very near the Earth.</i>

29:43.711 --> 29:46.441
<i>Project</i> Daedalus <i>is</i>
<i>a recent design...</i>

29:46.648 --> 29:49.048
<i>... of the British</i>
<i>Interplanetary Society.</i>

29:49.250 --> 29:52.742
<i>It assumes the existence</i>
<i>of a nuclear fusion reactor...</i>

29:52.954 --> 29:55.252
<i>... something much safer</i>
<i>and more efficient...</i>

29:55.457 --> 29:59.257
<i>... than the existing nuclear</i>
<i>fission power plants.</i>

30:03.498 --> 30:05.762
<i>We do not yet have fusion reactors.</i>

30:05.967 --> 30:08.697
<i>One day, quite soon, we may.</i>

30:14.409 --> 30:17.810
Orion <i>and</i> Daedalus <i>might go...</i>

30:18.012 --> 30:20.640
<i>... 10 percent the speed of light.</i>

30:21.783 --> 30:24.650
So a trip to Alpha Centauri,
41/2 light-years away...

30:24.853 --> 30:28.687
...would take 45 years,
less than a human lifetime.

30:29.257 --> 30:33.091
Such ships could not travel
close enough to the speed of light...

30:33.294 --> 30:36.229
...for the time-slowing effects
of special relativity...

30:36.431 --> 30:38.092
...to become important.

30:38.666 --> 30:41.362
It does not seem likely
that such ships...

30:41.569 --> 30:44.163
...would be built before
the middle of the 21 st century...

30:44.372 --> 30:48.172
...although we could build
an <i>Orion</i> starship now.

30:48.610 --> 30:52.671
For voyages beyond the nearest stars,
something must be added.

30:52.881 --> 30:55.975
Perhaps they could be used
as multigeneration ships...

30:56.351 --> 30:59.343
...so those arriving would be
the remote descendants...

30:59.554 --> 31:03.285
...of those who had originally
set out centuries before.

31:03.925 --> 31:07.952
Or perhaps some safe means
of human hibernation might be found...

31:08.163 --> 31:12.031
...so that space travelers might be
frozen and then thawed out...

31:12.233 --> 31:16.135
...when they arrive at
the destination centuries later.

31:16.838 --> 31:21.138
But fast interstellar space flight
approaching the speed of light...

31:21.342 --> 31:23.207
...is much more difficult.

31:23.411 --> 31:26.141
That's an objective
not for a hundred years...

31:26.347 --> 31:29.475
...but for a thousand
or for 10 thousand...

31:29.684 --> 31:32.152
...but it also is possible.

31:34.522 --> 31:37.491
A kind of interstellar ramjet
has been proposed...

31:37.692 --> 31:40.126
...which scoops up
the hydrogen atoms...

31:40.328 --> 31:42.262
...which float between the stars...

31:42.463 --> 31:46.524
...accelerates them into an engine
and spits them out the back.

31:47.368 --> 31:49.768
But in deep space,
there is one atom...

31:49.971 --> 31:54.032
...for every 10 cubic centimeters
of space.

31:54.242 --> 31:55.709
For the ramjet to work...

31:56.211 --> 31:58.771
...it has to have a frontal scoop...

31:58.980 --> 32:01.847
...hundreds of kilometers across.

32:02.116 --> 32:06.314
Reaching relativistic velocities,
the hydrogen atoms will be moving...

32:06.521 --> 32:09.081
...with respect
to the interstellar spaceship...

32:09.290 --> 32:11.315
...at close to the speed of light.

32:11.526 --> 32:13.255
If precautions aren't taken...

32:13.461 --> 32:18.023
...the passengers will be fried
by these induced cosmic rays.

32:18.233 --> 32:20.098
There's a proposed solution:

32:20.301 --> 32:23.600
A laser is used to strip
electrons off the atoms...

32:23.805 --> 32:27.036
...and electrically charge them
while they're some distance away.

32:27.609 --> 32:30.237
And an extremely strong
magnetic field...

32:30.478 --> 32:33.743
...is used to deflect
the charged atoms into the scoop...

32:33.948 --> 32:35.575
...and away from the spacecraft.

32:35.783 --> 32:37.080
This is engineering...

32:37.285 --> 32:41.085
...on a scale so far
unprecedented on the Earth.

32:41.289 --> 32:45.885
We are talking of engines
the size of small worlds.

32:55.303 --> 33:00.206
Suppose that the spacecraft is
designed to accelerate at 1 g...

33:00.408 --> 33:02.706
...so we'd be comfortable aboard it.

33:02.910 --> 33:05.344
We'd go closer and closer
to the speed of light...

33:05.546 --> 33:07.810
...until the midpoint of the journey.

33:08.016 --> 33:10.576
Then the spacecraft is
turned around...

33:10.785 --> 33:14.346
...and we decelerate at 1 g
to the destination.

33:14.922 --> 33:19.052
For most of the trip, the velocity
would be close to the speed of light...

33:19.260 --> 33:22.423
...and time would
slow down enormously.

33:22.764 --> 33:24.288
By how much?

33:25.266 --> 33:28.702
Barnard's Star could be reached
by such a ship...

33:28.903 --> 33:31.531
...in eight years, ship time.

33:32.140 --> 33:36.099
The center of the Milky Way galaxy
in 21 years.

33:36.311 --> 33:40.179
The Andromeda galaxy in 28 years.

33:40.715 --> 33:42.649
Of course, the people
left behind on the Earth...

33:42.850 --> 33:45.148
...would see things
somewhat differently.

33:45.420 --> 33:47.388
Instead of 21 years to the galaxy...

33:47.588 --> 33:51.149
...they would measure it
as 30,000 years.

33:51.359 --> 33:52.724
When we got back...

33:52.927 --> 33:56.385
...very few of our friends
would be around to greet us.

33:57.231 --> 33:58.994
In principle, such a journey...

33:59.200 --> 34:03.603
...mounting the decimal points closer
and closer to the speed of light...

34:03.805 --> 34:07.571
...would even permit us to
circumnavigate the known universe...

34:07.775 --> 34:10.835
...in 56 years, ship time.

34:11.779 --> 34:15.875
We would return tens
of billions of years...

34:16.084 --> 34:18.075
...in the far future...

34:18.286 --> 34:21.346
...with the Earth a charred cinder...

34:21.556 --> 34:24.024
...and the sun dead.

34:24.659 --> 34:28.060
Relativistic space flight makes
the universe accessible...

34:28.262 --> 34:30.628
...to advanced civilizations...

34:30.832 --> 34:33.027
...but only to those
who go on the journey...

34:33.234 --> 34:35.600
...not to those who stay home.

34:36.437 --> 34:40.771
These designs are probably further...

34:40.975 --> 34:44.706
...from the actual interstellar
spacecraft of the future...

34:45.913 --> 34:48.711
...than Leonardo's models are...

34:48.916 --> 34:52.249
...from the supersonic transports
of the present.

34:52.820 --> 34:54.685
But if we do not destroy ourselves...

34:54.889 --> 34:59.792
...I believe that we will,
one day, venture to the stars.

35:00.461 --> 35:03.021
When our solar system
is all explored...

35:03.231 --> 35:06.359
...the planets of other stars
will beckon.

35:40.168 --> 35:44.366
<i>Space travel and time travel</i>
<i>are connected.</i>

35:45.506 --> 35:47.440
<i>To travel fast into space...</i>

35:47.642 --> 35:50.839
<i>... is to travel fast into the future.</i>

35:53.714 --> 35:57.878
We travel into the future,
although slowly, all the time.

35:58.085 --> 36:02.385
But what about the past?
Could we journey into yesterday?

36:02.590 --> 36:05.718
Many physicists think this is
fundamentally impossible...

36:05.927 --> 36:08.259
...that we could
not build a device...

36:08.463 --> 36:11.193
...which would carry us
backwards into time.

36:11.399 --> 36:14.800
Some say that even if we were
to build such a device...

36:15.002 --> 36:16.264
...it wouldn't do much good.

36:16.471 --> 36:18.996
We couldn't significantly
affect the past.

36:19.207 --> 36:22.870
For example, suppose you
traveled into the past...

36:23.077 --> 36:25.170
...and somehow or other prevented...

36:25.379 --> 36:28.177
...your own parents from meeting.

36:28.382 --> 36:31.943
Why, then you would probably
never have been born...

36:32.153 --> 36:34.178
...which is something
of a contradiction, isn't it...

36:34.388 --> 36:36.515
...since you are clearly there.

36:37.124 --> 36:38.455
Other people think that...

36:38.659 --> 36:41.787
...the two alternative histories
have equal validity...

36:41.996 --> 36:45.397
...that they're parallel threads,
skeins of time...

36:45.600 --> 36:48.160
...that they could exist side by side.

36:52.039 --> 36:54.564
The history in which
you were never born...

36:54.775 --> 36:57.744
...and the history that
you know all about.

36:57.979 --> 37:01.176
Perhaps time itself has
many potential dimensions...

37:01.382 --> 37:04.647
...despite the fact that
we are condemned to experience...

37:04.852 --> 37:07.047
...only one of those dimensions.

37:07.688 --> 37:10.953
Now, suppose you could go back
into the past...

37:11.158 --> 37:14.616
...and really change it by,
let's say something like...

37:14.829 --> 37:19.323
...persuading Queen Isabella not
to bankroll Christopher Columbus.

37:19.534 --> 37:21.798
Then you would have set into motion...

37:22.003 --> 37:25.029
...a different sequence
of historical events...

37:25.239 --> 37:28.299
...which those people
you left behind you in our time...

37:28.509 --> 37:30.670
...would never get to know about.

37:30.878 --> 37:33.608
If that kind of time travel
were possible...

37:33.814 --> 37:37.011
...then every imaginable sequence...

37:37.218 --> 37:39.186
...of alternative history...

37:39.387 --> 37:41.582
...might in some sense really exist.

37:42.557 --> 37:44.616
Would it be possible
for a time traveler...

37:44.825 --> 37:48.192
...to change the course of history
in a major way?

37:48.396 --> 37:50.626
Well, let's think about that.

37:54.201 --> 37:56.465
<i>History consists for the most part...</i>

37:56.671 --> 38:00.732
<i>... of a complex multitude</i>
<i>of deeply interwoven threads...</i>

38:00.942 --> 38:03.604
<i>... biological, economic</i>
<i>and social forces...</i>

38:03.811 --> 38:06.302
<i>... that are not so easily unraveled.</i>

38:07.582 --> 38:12.212
<i>The ancient Greeks imagined the course</i>
<i>of human events to be a tapestry...</i>

38:12.420 --> 38:16.186
<i>... created by three goddesses:</i>
<i>the Fates.</i>

38:17.858 --> 38:22.090
<i>Random minor events generally</i>
<i>have no long-range consequences.</i>

38:22.296 --> 38:25.493
<i>But some which occur</i>
<i>at critical junctures...</i>

38:25.700 --> 38:28.225
<i>... may alter the weave of history.</i>

38:28.436 --> 38:31.428
<i>There may be cases where</i>
<i>profound changes can be made...</i>

38:31.639 --> 38:34.130
<i>... by relatively trivial adjustments.</i>

38:34.342 --> 38:39.109
<i>The further in the past such an event</i>
<i>is, the more powerful its influence.</i>

38:39.614 --> 38:43.072
<i>What if our time traveler had</i>
<i>persuaded Queen Isabella that...</i>

38:43.284 --> 38:45.184
<i>... Columbus' geography was wrong?</i>

38:45.386 --> 38:49.584
<i>Almost certainly, some other European</i>
<i>would have sailed to the New World.</i>

38:49.790 --> 38:51.451
<i>There were many inducements:</i>

38:51.659 --> 38:54.719
<i>The lure of the spice trade,</i>
<i>improvements in navigation...</i>

38:54.929 --> 38:57.363
<i>... competition among</i>
<i>rival European powers.</i>

38:57.565 --> 39:01.467
<i>The discovery of America</i>
<i>around 1500 was inevitable.</i>

39:01.669 --> 39:05.070
<i>Of course, there wouldn't be any</i>
<i>postage stamps showing Columbus...</i>

39:05.272 --> 39:08.207
<i>... and the Republic of Colombia</i>
<i>would have another name.</i>

39:08.409 --> 39:12.402
<i>But the big picture would have</i>
<i>turned out more or less the same.</i>

39:17.018 --> 39:20.215
In order to affect
the future profoundly...

39:20.421 --> 39:22.981
...a time traveler
has to pick and choose.

39:23.190 --> 39:26.648
He'd probably have to intervene
in a number of events...

39:26.861 --> 39:29.557
...which are
very carefully selected...

39:29.764 --> 39:34.599
...so he could change
the weave of history.

39:35.002 --> 39:37.527
It's a lovely fantasy...

39:37.738 --> 39:41.674
...to explore those other worlds
that never were.

39:44.178 --> 39:47.773
<i>If you had H.G. Wells' time machine...</i>

39:47.982 --> 39:51.008
<i>... maybe you could understand</i>
<i>how history really works.</i>

39:51.218 --> 39:54.085
<i>If an apparently pivotal person</i>
<i>had never lived...</i>

39:54.288 --> 39:58.452
<i>... Paul the Apostle or Peter the Great</i>
<i>or Pythagoras...</i>

39:58.659 --> 40:01.355
<i>... how different would</i>
<i>the world really be?</i>

40:02.163 --> 40:04.256
What if the scientific tradition...

40:04.465 --> 40:07.229
...of the ancient Ionian Greeks...

40:07.435 --> 40:10.097
...had prospered and flourished?

40:10.304 --> 40:13.171
It would have required
many social factors at the time...

40:13.374 --> 40:15.103
...to have been different...

40:15.309 --> 40:17.743
...including the common feeling...

40:17.945 --> 40:20.641
...that slavery was right and natural.

40:20.848 --> 40:24.409
But what if that light
that had dawned...

40:24.618 --> 40:27.985
...on the eastern Mediterranean
some 2500 years ago...

40:28.189 --> 40:30.157
...had not flickered out?

40:30.357 --> 40:33.656
What if scientific method
and experiment...

40:33.861 --> 40:35.852
...had been vigorously pursued...

40:36.063 --> 40:38.327
...2000 years before
the industrial revolution...

40:38.532 --> 40:40.500
...our industrial revolution?

40:40.701 --> 40:44.762
What if the power of this new mode
of thought, the scientific method...

40:44.972 --> 40:47.270
...had been generally appreciated?

40:47.641 --> 40:51.372
I think we might have saved
10 or 20 centuries.

40:51.579 --> 40:54.275
Perhaps the contributions
that Leonardo made...

40:54.482 --> 40:57.315
...would have been made
1000 years earlier...

40:57.518 --> 41:01.318
...and the contributions
of Einstein 500 years ago.

41:01.522 --> 41:03.649
Not that it would have
been those people...

41:03.858 --> 41:06.292
...who would've made
those contributions...

41:06.494 --> 41:09.486
...because they lived only
in our timeline.

41:10.064 --> 41:12.999
If the Ionians had won...

41:13.200 --> 41:17.193
...we might by now, I think,
be going to the stars.

41:17.404 --> 41:22.137
We might at this moment have
the first survey ships...

41:22.343 --> 41:27.007
...returning with astonishing results
from Alpha Centauri...

41:27.214 --> 41:31.810
...and Barnard's Star,
Sirius and Tau Ceti.

41:32.019 --> 41:35.318
There would now be great fleets...

41:35.523 --> 41:37.491
...of interstellar transports...

41:37.691 --> 41:40.182
...being constructed in Earth orbit...

41:40.394 --> 41:43.386
...small, unmanned survey ships...

41:43.597 --> 41:47.055
...liners for immigrants, perhaps...

41:47.268 --> 41:48.667
...great trading ships...

41:48.869 --> 41:52.327
...to ply the spaces
between the stars.

41:52.807 --> 41:56.004
<i>On all these ships</i>
<i>there would be symbols...</i>

41:56.210 --> 41:58.940
<i>... and inscriptions on the sides.</i>

41:59.146 --> 42:01.410
<i>The inscriptions,</i>
<i>if we looked closely...</i>

42:01.615 --> 42:04.243
<i>... would be written in Greek.</i>

42:04.752 --> 42:06.083
<i>The symbol...</i>

42:06.287 --> 42:09.745
<i>... perhaps, would be the dodecahedron.</i>

42:09.957 --> 42:14.587
<i>And the inscription on the sides</i>
<i>of the ships to the stars...</i>

42:14.795 --> 42:16.262
<i>... something like:</i>

42:16.463 --> 42:21.196
<i>"Starship</i> Theodorus
<i>of the Planet Earth."</i>

42:24.205 --> 42:27.003
<i>If you were a really</i>
<i>ambitious time traveler...</i>

42:30.211 --> 42:32.975
<i>... you might not dally</i>
<i>with human history...</i>

42:33.180 --> 42:35.808
<i>... or even pause to examine</i>
<i>the evolution on Earth.</i>

42:36.016 --> 42:38.246
<i>Instead, you would journey back...</i>

42:38.452 --> 42:39.851
<i>... to witness the origin</i>
<i>of our solar system...</i>

42:40.321 --> 42:44.849
<i>... from the gas and dust</i>
<i>between the stars.</i>

42:46.026 --> 42:47.459
<i>Five billion years ago...</i>

42:47.661 --> 42:51.256
<i>... an interstellar cloud was</i>
<i>collapsing to form our solar system.</i>

42:51.465 --> 42:54.696
<i>Most clumps of matter</i>
<i>gravitated towards the center...</i>

42:54.902 --> 42:57.462
<i>... and were destined</i>
<i>to form the sun.</i>

42:57.671 --> 43:01.903
<i>Smaller peripheral clumps</i>
<i>would become the planets.</i>

43:02.109 --> 43:06.512
<i>Long ago, there was a kind of</i>
<i>natural selection among the worlds.</i>

43:06.714 --> 43:10.912
<i>Those on highly elliptical orbits</i>
<i>tended to collide and be destroyed...</i>

43:11.118 --> 43:14.713
<i>... but planets in circular orbits</i>
<i>tended to survive.</i>

43:14.922 --> 43:17.186
<i>But if events had been</i>
<i>a little different...</i>

43:17.391 --> 43:19.052
<i>... the Earth would never have formed...</i>

43:19.260 --> 43:23.219
<i>... and another planet at another</i>
<i>distance from the sun would be around.</i>

43:23.430 --> 43:25.694
<i>We owe the existence of our world...</i>

43:25.900 --> 43:29.734
<i>... to random collisions</i>
<i>in a long-vanished cloud.</i>

43:32.573 --> 43:35.633
<i>Soon, the central mass</i>
<i>became very hot.</i>

43:35.843 --> 43:39.677
<i>Thermonuclear reactions were initiated</i>
<i>and the sun turned on...</i>

43:39.880 --> 43:42.747
<i>... flooding the solar system</i>
<i>with light.</i>

43:45.119 --> 43:47.087
<i>But the growing smaller lumps...</i>

43:47.288 --> 43:49.518
<i>... would never achieve</i>
<i>such high temperatures...</i>

43:49.723 --> 43:52.556
<i>... and would never generate</i>
<i>thermonuclear reactions.</i>

43:52.760 --> 43:56.491
<i>They would become</i>
<i>the Earth and the other planets...</i>

43:56.697 --> 44:00.929
<i>... heated not from within,</i>
<i>but mainly by the distant sun.</i>

44:05.606 --> 44:07.403
<i>The accretion continued until...</i>

44:07.608 --> 44:10.873
<i>... almost all the gas and dust</i>
<i>and small worldlets...</i>

44:11.078 --> 44:14.479
<i>... were swept up</i>
<i>by the surviving planets.</i>

44:16.850 --> 44:19.148
<i>Our time traveler would witness...</i>

44:19.353 --> 44:22.288
<i>... the collisions</i>
<i>that made the worlds.</i>

44:28.462 --> 44:30.487
<i>Except for the comets and asteroids...</i>

44:30.698 --> 44:33.326
<i>... the chaos of the early</i>
<i>solar system was reduced...</i>

44:33.534 --> 44:35.866
<i>... to a remarkable simplicity:</i>

44:36.070 --> 44:39.904
<i>Nine or so principal planets</i>
<i>in almost circular orbits...</i>

44:40.107 --> 44:42.166
<i>... and a few dozen moons.</i>

44:46.647 --> 44:49.582
<i>Now, let's take a different look.</i>

44:51.218 --> 44:53.686
<i>If we view the solar system edge on...</i>

44:53.887 --> 44:56.151
<i>... and move the sun</i>
<i>off-screen to the left...</i>

44:56.357 --> 44:59.019
<i>... we see that</i>
<i>the small terrestrial planets...</i>

44:59.226 --> 45:02.855
<i>... the ones about as massive as Earth,</i>
<i>tend to be close to the sun.</i>

45:03.063 --> 45:06.897
<i>The big Jupiter-like planets tend</i>
<i>to be much further from the sun.</i>

45:07.101 --> 45:09.968
<i>But is that the way it has to be?</i>

45:11.171 --> 45:12.832
<i>Computer studies suggest...</i>

45:13.040 --> 45:15.804
<i>... that there may be many</i>
<i>similar systems about stars...</i>

45:16.010 --> 45:20.379
<i>... with the terrestrials in close</i>
<i>and the Jovian planets further away.</i>

45:24.251 --> 45:27.982
<i>But some systems might have Jovians</i>
<i>and terrestrials mixed together.</i>

45:28.188 --> 45:32.716
<i>There may be great worlds</i>
<i>like Jupiter looming in other skies.</i>

45:34.028 --> 45:37.987
<i>Rarely, the Jovian planets</i>
<i>may form close to the star...</i>

45:38.198 --> 45:42.532
<i>... the terrestrials trailing away</i>
<i>towards interstellar space.</i>

45:43.871 --> 45:45.862
<i>Our familiar arrangement of planets...</i>

45:46.073 --> 45:48.837
<i>... is only one,</i>
<i>perhaps typical, case...</i>

45:49.043 --> 45:53.104
<i>... in the vast expanse of systems.</i>

45:53.313 --> 45:57.943
<i>Often, one fledgling planet</i>
<i>accumulates so much gas and dust...</i>

45:58.152 --> 46:00.347
<i>... that thermonuclear reactions</i>
<i>do occur.</i>

46:00.554 --> 46:02.647
<i>It becomes a second sun.</i>

46:02.856 --> 46:05.689
<i>A binary star system has formed.</i>

46:10.197 --> 46:14.099
<i>From most of these worlds,</i>
<i>the vistas will be dazzling.</i>

46:14.301 --> 46:16.667
<i>Not one of them will be</i>
<i>identical to the Earth.</i>

46:16.870 --> 46:21.239
<i>A few will be hospitable.</i>
<i>Many will appear hostile.</i>

46:22.643 --> 46:24.668
<i>Where there are two suns in the sky...</i>

46:24.878 --> 46:28.575
<i>... every object will cast two shadows.</i>

46:32.753 --> 46:35.381
<i>What wonders are waiting for us...</i>

46:35.589 --> 46:37.955
<i>... on the planets of the nearby stars?</i>

46:38.158 --> 46:41.025
<i>Are there radically</i>
<i>different kinds of worlds...</i>

46:41.228 --> 46:44.288
<i>... unimaginably exotic forms of life?</i>

46:47.568 --> 46:50.469
<i>Perhaps in another century or two...</i>

46:50.671 --> 46:52.662
<i>... when our solar system</i>
<i>is all explored...</i>

46:52.873 --> 46:56.104
<i>... we will also have put</i>
<i>our own planet in order.</i>

46:56.310 --> 46:59.768
<i>Then we will set sail for the stars...</i>

46:59.980 --> 47:02.642
<i>... and the beckoning worlds</i>
<i>around them.</i>

47:06.086 --> 47:09.214
<i>In that day, our machines</i>
<i>and our descendants...</i>

47:09.423 --> 47:13.120
<i>... approaching the speed of light,</i>
<i>will skim the light-years...</i>

47:13.327 --> 47:17.957
<i>... leaping ahead through time,</i>
<i>seeking new worlds.</i>

47:18.165 --> 47:21.692
<i>Einstein has shown us</i>
<i>that it's possible.</i>

47:22.936 --> 47:25.029
<i>We will journey simultaneously...</i>

47:25.239 --> 47:28.640
<i>... to distant planets</i>
<i>and to the far future.</i>

47:29.443 --> 47:31.138
<i>Some worlds, like this one...</i>

47:31.345 --> 47:34.610
<i>... will look out onto</i>
<i>a vast gaseous nebula...</i>

47:34.815 --> 47:36.544
<i>... the remains of a star...</i>

47:36.750 --> 47:39.878
<i>... that once was and is no longer.</i>

47:42.389 --> 47:44.914
In all those skies,
rich and distant...

47:45.125 --> 47:47.650
...and exotic constellations...

47:47.861 --> 47:51.820
...there may be a faint yellow star...

47:52.032 --> 47:54.933
...perhaps barely visible
to the naked eye...

47:55.135 --> 47:57.968
...perhaps seen only
through the telescope.

47:58.172 --> 48:02.040
The home star of a fleet
of interstellar transports...

48:02.242 --> 48:04.403
...exploring this tiny region...

48:04.611 --> 48:07.705
...of the great Milky Way galaxy.

48:08.148 --> 48:12.414
The themes of space and time
are intertwined.

48:12.619 --> 48:15.611
Worlds and stars, like people...

48:15.822 --> 48:19.622
...are born, live and die.

48:19.826 --> 48:22.556
The lifetime of a human being
is measured in decades.

48:22.763 --> 48:24.993
But the lifetime of the sun...

48:25.199 --> 48:28.032
...is a hundred million times longer.

48:30.204 --> 48:32.764
<i>Matter is much older than life.</i>

48:32.973 --> 48:36.204
<i>Billions of years before</i>
<i>the sun and Earth even formed...</i>

48:36.410 --> 48:39.777
<i>... atoms were being synthesized</i>
<i>in the insides of hot stars...</i>

48:39.980 --> 48:44.349
<i>... and then returned to space</i>
<i>when the stars blew themselves up.</i>

48:44.551 --> 48:47.884
<i>Newly formed planets were</i>
<i>made of this stellar debris.</i>

48:48.088 --> 48:52.388
<i>The Earth and every living thing</i>
<i>are made of star stuff.</i>

48:57.231 --> 49:01.065
<i>But how slowly, in our human</i>
<i>perspective, life evolved...</i>

49:01.268 --> 49:05.705
<i>... from the molecules of the early</i>
<i>oceans to the first bacteria.</i>

49:09.476 --> 49:12.411
<i>Evolution is not immediately</i>
<i>obvious to everybody...</i>

49:12.613 --> 49:15.912
<i>... because it moves</i>
<i>so slowly and takes so long.</i>

49:16.116 --> 49:19.244
<i>How can creatures who</i>
<i>live for only 70 years...</i>

49:19.453 --> 49:23.184
<i>... detect events that</i>
<i>take 70 million years to unfold?</i>

49:23.390 --> 49:25.187
<i>Or 4 billion?</i>

49:30.230 --> 49:32.596
<i>By the time</i>
<i>one-celled animals had evolved...</i>

49:32.799 --> 49:36.030
<i>... the history of life</i>
<i>on Earth was half over.</i>

49:40.474 --> 49:43.238
<i>Not very far along to us,</i>
<i>you might think...</i>

49:43.443 --> 49:46.105
<i>... but by now almost all</i>
<i>the basic chemistry of life...</i>

49:46.313 --> 49:48.338
<i>... had been established.</i>

49:49.583 --> 49:51.551
<i>Forget our human time perspective.</i>

49:51.752 --> 49:53.743
<i>From the point of view of a star...</i>

49:53.954 --> 49:57.219
<i>... evolution was weaving</i>
<i>intricate new patterns...</i>

49:57.424 --> 50:01.383
<i>... from the star stuff on</i>
<i>the planet Earth, and very rapidly.</i>

50:04.097 --> 50:06.793
<i>Most evolutionary lines</i>
<i>became extinct.</i>

50:07.000 --> 50:09.093
<i>Many lines became stagnant.</i>

50:09.303 --> 50:11.294
<i>If things had gone</i>
<i>a bit differently...</i>

50:11.505 --> 50:13.598
<i>... a small change of climate,</i>
<i>say, or...</i>

50:13.807 --> 50:14.865
<i>... a new mutation...</i>

50:15.075 --> 50:18.476
<i>... or the accidental death</i>
<i>of a different humble organism...</i>

50:18.679 --> 50:22.877
<i>... the entire future history of life</i>
<i>might have been very different.</i>

50:25.552 --> 50:28.453
<i>Maybe the line to an intelligent</i>
<i>technological species...</i>

50:28.655 --> 50:31.317
<i>... would have passed through worms.</i>

50:34.161 --> 50:36.322
<i>Maybe the present masters</i>
<i>of the planet...</i>

50:36.530 --> 50:40.193
<i>... would have had ancestors</i>
<i>who were tunicates.</i>

50:42.669 --> 50:44.193
<i>We might not have evolved.</i>

50:44.404 --> 50:47.430
<i>Someone else,</i>
<i>someone very different...</i>

50:47.641 --> 50:52.476
<i>... would be here now in our stead,</i>
<i>maybe pondering their origins.</i>

50:54.581 --> 50:56.674
<i>But that's not what happened.</i>

50:56.883 --> 50:59.943
<i>There's a particular sequence</i>
<i>of environmental accidents...</i>

51:00.153 --> 51:03.281
<i>... and random mutations</i>
<i>in the hereditary material.</i>

51:03.490 --> 51:07.187
<i>One particular timeline</i>
<i>for life on Earth...</i>

51:07.394 --> 51:09.225
<i>... in this universe.</i>

51:13.200 --> 51:17.034
<i>As a result, the dominant organisms</i>
<i>on the planet today...</i>

51:17.237 --> 51:19.171
<i>... come from fish.</i>

51:21.007 --> 51:24.704
<i>Along the way, many more species</i>
<i>became extinct than now exist.</i>

51:24.911 --> 51:28.142
<i>If history had</i>
<i>a slightly different weave...</i>

51:28.348 --> 51:32.808
<i>... some of those extinct organisms</i>
<i>might have survived and prospered.</i>

51:33.620 --> 51:36.783
<i>But occasionally, a creature</i>
<i>thought to have become extinct...</i>

51:36.990 --> 51:38.890
<i>... hundreds of millions</i>
<i>of years ago...</i>

51:39.092 --> 51:41.959
<i>... turns out to be alive and well.</i>

51:42.162 --> 51:44.824
<i>The coelacanth, for example.</i>

51:46.933 --> 51:51.768
<i>For 31/2 billion years, life had</i>
<i>lived exclusively in the water.</i>

51:51.972 --> 51:54.406
<i>But now, in a great</i>
<i>breathtaking adventure...</i>

51:54.608 --> 51:55.836
<i>... it took to the land.</i>

51:56.042 --> 51:58.169
<i>But if things had gone</i>
<i>a little differently...</i>

51:58.378 --> 52:01.108
<i>... the dominant species might</i>
<i>still be in the ocean...</i>

52:01.314 --> 52:05.683
<i>... or developed spaceships to</i>
<i>carry them off the planet altogether.</i>

52:11.324 --> 52:13.383
<i>From our ancestors, the reptiles...</i>

52:13.593 --> 52:15.959
<i>... there developed</i>
<i>many successful lines...</i>

52:16.163 --> 52:18.723
<i>... including the dinosaurs.</i>

52:19.032 --> 52:22.001
<i>Some were fast, dexterous</i>
<i>and intelligent.</i>

52:22.202 --> 52:24.170
<i>A visitor from</i>
<i>another world or time...</i>

52:24.371 --> 52:27.135
<i>... might have thought them</i>
<i>the wave of the future.</i>

52:27.340 --> 52:31.902
<i>But after nearly 200 million years,</i>
<i>they were suddenly all wiped out.</i>

52:32.112 --> 52:34.876
<i>Perhaps it was a great meteorite</i>
<i>colliding with the Earth...</i>

52:35.081 --> 52:37.811
<i>... spewing debris into the air,</i>
<i>blotting out the sun...</i>

52:38.018 --> 52:40.543
<i>... and killing the plants</i>
<i>that the dinosaurs ate.</i>

52:40.754 --> 52:45.248
<i>I wonder when they first sensed</i>
<i>that something was wrong.</i>

52:47.360 --> 52:51.126
<i>The successors of the dinosaurs</i>
<i>came from the same reptilian stock...</i>

52:51.331 --> 52:55.768
<i>... but they survived the catastrophe</i>
<i>that destroyed their cousins.</i>

52:58.371 --> 53:01.067
<i>Again, there were many branches</i>
<i>which became extinct.</i>

53:01.274 --> 53:03.572
<i>And had events been</i>
<i>a little different...</i>

53:03.777 --> 53:07.235
<i>... those branches might have led</i>
<i>to the dominant form today.</i>

53:10.116 --> 53:13.176
<i>For 40 million years, a visitor</i>
<i>would not have been impressed...</i>

53:13.386 --> 53:15.513
<i>... by these timid little creatures...</i>

53:15.722 --> 53:19.351
<i>... but they led to all</i>
<i>the familiar mammals of today.</i>

53:21.862 --> 53:24.831
<i>And that includes the primates.</i>

53:25.732 --> 53:29.099
<i>About 20 million years ago,</i>
<i>a space time traveler...</i>

53:29.302 --> 53:31.930
<i>... might have recognized</i>
<i>these guys as promising...</i>

53:32.138 --> 53:35.733
<i>... bright, quick, agile,</i>
<i>sociable, curious.</i>

53:35.976 --> 53:39.036
<i>Their ancestors were once</i>
<i>atoms made in stars...</i>

53:39.246 --> 53:42.079
<i>... then simple molecules,</i>
<i>single cells...</i>

53:42.282 --> 53:44.546
<i>... polyps stuck to the ocean floor...</i>

53:44.751 --> 53:48.152
<i>... fish, amphibians, reptiles, shrews.</i>

53:48.555 --> 53:52.958
<i>But then they came down</i>
<i>from the trees and stood upright.</i>

53:53.159 --> 53:55.525
<i>They grew an enormous brain...</i>

53:55.729 --> 53:58.857
<i>... they developed culture,</i>
<i>invented tools...</i>

53:59.065 --> 54:01.124
<i>... domesticated fire.</i>

54:04.671 --> 54:07.333
<i>They discovered language and writing.</i>

54:07.541 --> 54:09.532
<i>They developed agriculture.</i>

54:09.743 --> 54:13.338
<i>They built cities and forged metal.</i>

54:15.115 --> 54:18.949
<i>And ultimately,</i>
<i>they set out for the stars...</i>

54:19.152 --> 54:23.486
<i>... from which they had come</i>
<i>5 billion years earlier.</i>

54:25.892 --> 54:27.416
<i>We are star stuff...</i>

54:27.627 --> 54:31.028
<i>... which has taken its destiny</i>
<i>into its own hands.</i>

54:33.833 --> 54:35.960
<i>The loom of time and space...</i>

54:36.169 --> 54:39.798
<i>... works the most astonishing</i>
<i>transformations of matter.</i>

54:40.974 --> 54:43.966
<i>Our own planet is only a tiny part...</i>

54:44.177 --> 54:46.304
<i>... of the vast cosmic tapestry...</i>

54:46.513 --> 54:51.246
<i>... a starry fabric</i>
<i>of worlds yet untold.</i>

54:58.124 --> 55:02.151
Those worlds in space
are as countless...

55:02.362 --> 55:06.059
...as all the grains of sand
on all the beaches of the Earth.

55:06.733 --> 55:09.668
Each of those worlds
is as real as ours.

55:09.869 --> 55:12.360
In every one of them,
there's a succession of...

55:12.572 --> 55:17.202
...incidents, events, occurrences
which influence its future.

55:17.410 --> 55:21.005
Countless worlds,
numberless moments...

55:21.214 --> 55:24.672
...an immensity of space and time.

55:24.884 --> 55:27.682
And our small planet,
at this moment...

55:27.887 --> 55:32.324
...here, we face
a critical branchpoint in history.

55:32.525 --> 55:35.426
What we do with our world right now...

55:35.629 --> 55:37.927
...will propagate down
through the centuries...

55:38.131 --> 55:41.532
...and powerfully affect
the destiny of our descendants.

55:41.735 --> 55:45.535
It is well within our power
to destroy our civilization...

55:45.739 --> 55:48.572
...and perhaps our species as well.

55:48.775 --> 55:51.175
If we capitulate to superstition...

55:51.378 --> 55:53.744
...or greed or stupidity...

55:53.947 --> 55:57.883
...we can plunge our world into
a darkness deeper than the time...

55:58.084 --> 56:02.418
...between the collapse of classical
civilization and Italian Renaissance.

56:02.622 --> 56:04.886
But we are also capable...

56:05.091 --> 56:07.582
...of using our compassion
and our intelligence...

56:07.794 --> 56:10.388
...our technology and our wealth...

56:10.597 --> 56:13.065
...to make an abundant
and meaningful life...

56:13.266 --> 56:15.564
...for every inhabitant
of this planet...

56:15.769 --> 56:20.263
...to enhance enormously
our understanding of the universe...

56:20.674 --> 56:23.734
...and to carry us to the stars.

56:39.592 --> 56:41.219
In our motorbike sequence...

56:41.428 --> 56:43.919
...we showed how
the landscape might look...

56:44.130 --> 56:46.860
...if we barreled through it
at close to light speed.

56:47.067 --> 56:50.002
Since then,
inspired by this sequence...

56:50.203 --> 56:53.798
...Ping-Kang Hsiung
at Carnegie Mellon University...

56:54.007 --> 56:55.941
...produced an exact
computer animation.

56:56.443 --> 56:59.674
<i>This is what you'd see if you</i>
<i>traveled at ordinary speeds...</i>

56:59.879 --> 57:02.109
<i>... through this red and white lattice.</i>

57:02.315 --> 57:04.146
<i>But this is how it would appear...</i>

57:04.350 --> 57:08.286
<i>... if you were traveling</i>
<i>at close to the speed of light.</i>

57:09.155 --> 57:13.182
We're probably many centuries away
from traveling close to light speed...

57:13.393 --> 57:16.260
...and experiencing time dilation.

57:16.463 --> 57:19.330
But even then,
it might not be fast enough...

57:19.532 --> 57:22.933
...if we wanted to travel
to some distant place in the galaxy...

57:23.136 --> 57:25.866
...and then come back to Earth
in our own epoch.

57:26.372 --> 57:29.466
Some years after completing <i>Cosmos...</i>

57:29.676 --> 57:34.204
...I took time out from
my scientific work to write a novel.

57:34.714 --> 57:36.306
A novel about travel...

57:36.516 --> 57:39.713
...to the center
of the Milky Way galaxy.

57:39.986 --> 57:43.319
I was willing to imagine
beings and civilizations...

57:43.523 --> 57:45.548
...far more advanced than we...

57:45.759 --> 57:49.058
...but I wasn't willing
to ignore the laws of physics.

57:49.295 --> 57:53.857
Was there, even in principle,
a way to get very quickly...

57:54.067 --> 57:57.036
...to 30,000 light-years from Earth?

57:57.237 --> 57:59.102
So I asked my friend...

57:59.305 --> 58:02.536
...Kip Thorne of the California
Institute of Technology.

58:02.742 --> 58:05.768
He's a leading expert
on the nature of space and time.

58:05.979 --> 58:08.447
Kip thought about it for a while...

58:08.648 --> 58:11.742
...and then answered with
about 50 lines of equations...

58:11.951 --> 58:14.681
...which showed that
a really advanced civilization...

58:14.888 --> 58:18.824
...might establish
and hold open wormholes...

58:21.027 --> 58:24.724
...which we might think of as tubes
through the fourth dimension...

58:24.931 --> 58:27.764
...which connect the Earth
with another place...

58:27.967 --> 58:31.425
...without having to traverse
the intervening distance.

58:31.671 --> 58:35.539
Something like crawling
through a wormhole in an apple.

58:35.975 --> 58:37.840
I was happy with this result...

58:38.044 --> 58:41.536
...and used it as
a key plot device in <i>Contact.</i>

58:42.015 --> 58:44.040
But such wormholes through space...

58:44.250 --> 58:47.185
...would also be time machines,
it seemed to me.

58:47.387 --> 58:50.254
And I used that notion
in my novel <i>Contact</i> as well.

58:50.723 --> 58:54.819
Kip Thorne and his colleagues
later proved, or so it seemed...

58:55.028 --> 58:57.496
...that time travel
of this sort was possible.

58:57.697 --> 59:00.029
Here, look at this.

59:01.234 --> 59:03.862
The key question being explored now...

59:04.070 --> 59:07.528
...is whether such time travel
can be done consistently...

59:07.740 --> 59:12.040
...with causes preceding effects, say,
rather than following them.

59:12.245 --> 59:13.712
Does nature contrive it...

59:13.913 --> 59:17.144
...so that even with a time machine,
you can't intervene...

59:17.350 --> 59:20.444
...to prevent your own conception,
for example?

59:20.653 --> 59:23.679
Even if time travel of this sort
is really possible...

59:23.890 --> 59:26.757
...it's far in
our technological future.

59:26.960 --> 59:30.919
But maybe other beings
much more advanced than we...

59:31.130 --> 59:34.065
...are voyaging to the far future
and the remote past...

59:34.267 --> 59:37.259
...not a measly 40 years ago
on Earth...

59:37.470 --> 59:39.961
...but to witness
the death of the sun, say...

59:40.173 --> 59:42.368
...or the origin of the cosmos.
