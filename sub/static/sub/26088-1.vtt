05:10.204 --> 05:15.041
I want you to look around
at the new faces today.

05:15.043 --> 05:16.742
These are your brothers
and sisters.

05:16.744 --> 05:20.045
You will serve together,
and you will fight together.

05:20.047 --> 05:22.781
You will laugh
and you will cry together.

05:22.783 --> 05:24.516
This is your home

05:24.518 --> 05:26.618
and I am proud
to be serving alongside

05:26.620 --> 05:28.120
each and every one of you.

05:28.122 --> 05:32.291
Now as we set sail, I want
each one of you to think

05:32.293 --> 05:34.860
about what you are
fighting to protect

05:34.862 --> 05:38.697
because that is the thing
that will keep you going.

05:38.699 --> 05:42.468
That is the thing that will make
sure that you never give up.

05:42.470 --> 05:46.271
I want you to remember
our core principles:

05:46.273 --> 05:49.141
honor, courage
and commitment.

05:49.143 --> 05:51.877
That is what sets
the Navy apart.

05:51.879 --> 05:52.978
Why are we here?

05:52.980 --> 05:55.012
So others may live!
Hooyah!

05:55.014 --> 05:56.415
Hooyah!

05:56.417 --> 05:59.252
And now it is my privilege
to present to you

05:59.254 --> 06:01.654
a very special guest:
Admiral King.

06:01.656 --> 06:03.421
You should all feel
honored today

06:03.423 --> 06:07.459
as the Admiral takes great pride
in welcoming new cadets.

06:07.461 --> 06:09.096
Admiral on deck!

06:19.639 --> 06:21.009
At ease, sailors!

06:24.144 --> 06:26.113
Thank you, Captain.

06:27.749 --> 06:29.981
You've all come a
very long way,

06:29.983 --> 06:35.788
and now you'll be
tested out in the open sea.

06:35.790 --> 06:38.122
So be careful.

06:38.124 --> 06:40.993
A mistake can cost a life.

06:40.995 --> 06:46.632
An even bigger mistake can
cost a lot more than that.

06:46.634 --> 06:50.168
All I ask is you keep
your eyes open,

06:50.170 --> 06:51.639
and watch your backs.

06:53.307 --> 06:54.774
I'm proud to be here.

06:54.776 --> 06:57.543
I'm proud to have you
as my crew.

06:57.546 --> 07:02.283
This could be my last voyage.
Let's make it count.

07:04.083 --> 07:05.750
Sir...?

07:05.752 --> 07:07.486
Now's not a
good time, Vallier.

07:07.488 --> 07:08.687
Yes, sir.

07:08.689 --> 07:11.223
It's just...
we've got something.

07:11.225 --> 07:12.892
What do you mean?

07:12.894 --> 07:14.526
Well, we've picked up
something on the sonar.

07:14.528 --> 07:16.196
I think you need to see it.

07:24.370 --> 07:25.904
So what do we know?

07:25.906 --> 07:27.238
Not much, sir.

07:27.240 --> 07:29.341
How far down?
We talking about a sub here?

07:29.343 --> 07:31.877
Not sure, sir,
but I did catch a sound.

07:31.879 --> 07:33.077
A sound?

07:33.079 --> 07:34.814
What do you mean, sound?

07:34.816 --> 07:36.548
The timing on it, Munos?

07:36.550 --> 07:38.017
It's been about
three minutes, ma'am.

07:38.019 --> 07:40.487
- You got a bearing on it yet?
- I'm trying.

07:42.723 --> 07:44.356
What in God's name
is going on?

07:44.358 --> 07:47.026
Captain on deck!

07:47.028 --> 07:49.161
As you were.
What's going on?

07:49.163 --> 07:50.363
Strange signal.

07:50.365 --> 07:51.831
No bearing yet,
but it's deep.

07:51.833 --> 07:53.632
- What is it?
- We're working on that, sir.

07:53.634 --> 07:55.834
Okay. Can we work on it
without hearing it?

07:55.836 --> 07:57.769
We're thinking it's either
a sub or a drone.

07:57.771 --> 07:59.738
But since it's so deep,
I'm willing to say

07:59.740 --> 08:00.772
it's not a drone.

08:00.774 --> 08:02.740
We're picking
something up, sir.

08:02.742 --> 08:03.875
How far out?

08:03.878 --> 08:06.180
Closing in on it.
Just...

08:10.750 --> 08:12.250
Is this it?

08:12.253 --> 08:15.954
Admiral on the bridge!

08:15.956 --> 08:17.421
As you were.

08:17.423 --> 08:19.757
Captain, what have we got?

08:19.759 --> 08:21.293
Looks like a sub.

08:21.295 --> 08:23.029
What are you gonna do
about that?

08:23.031 --> 08:26.531
Well, we're working on it.
Vallier, what can you give me?

08:26.533 --> 08:27.899
Well, it's hard to say, sir.

08:27.902 --> 08:31.769
But I'm guessing
we're right above it.

08:31.771 --> 08:33.405
What do you think?

08:33.407 --> 08:35.710
I think we should
check it out.

08:37.010 --> 08:38.376
- Lynch?
- Yes, sir?

08:38.379 --> 08:42.080
Wait until the Admiral
has a chance to speak.

08:42.082 --> 08:43.948
The Russians have
been operating

08:43.951 --> 08:46.651
around this region for
a really long time.

08:46.653 --> 08:49.588
But we never really had any
hard proof of it yet.

08:49.590 --> 08:52.424
We need to find out
if it's them.

08:52.426 --> 08:54.359
Well, if we're gonna
step in it,

08:54.361 --> 08:57.593
then we're gonna have
to clean it up.

08:57.595 --> 08:58.863
And I'd rather we get this
over with before NATO

08:58.865 --> 09:01.633
sticks its big snout right
in my face.

09:01.635 --> 09:03.802
- Or the president.
- Yeah, him too, yeah.

09:03.804 --> 09:05.270
Well, we'll get
to the bottom of it.

09:05.272 --> 09:09.041
I could take
the bell down, sir.

09:09.043 --> 09:10.943
Admiral, if you'll excuse us?

09:10.945 --> 09:14.613
I need to speak with
my Commander in private.

09:14.615 --> 09:16.850
All right then.
You guys let me know.

09:22.923 --> 09:24.455
You do not speak
to a CO like that!

09:24.457 --> 09:25.824
Especially in the presence
of an Admiral.

09:25.826 --> 09:27.761
- Do you understand?
- Sorry, sir.

09:29.931 --> 09:33.031
You really want to get that
thing in the water, don't you?

09:33.033 --> 09:34.132
I do, sir.

09:34.134 --> 09:36.300
I helped develop that thing.

09:36.302 --> 09:39.872
Which you never
tire of reminding us.

09:39.875 --> 09:41.172
All right.
I'll consider it.

09:41.174 --> 09:42.340
Thank you, sir.

09:42.342 --> 09:43.709
Deploy the drones first.

09:43.711 --> 09:45.076
If there's anything
worth looking at,

09:45.078 --> 09:46.244
I'll consider sending you.

09:46.247 --> 09:47.246
Yes, sir.
Already on it.

09:47.248 --> 09:48.714
Excuse me, Commander?

09:48.716 --> 09:52.218
I may have already ordered
the drones prepped, sir.

09:52.220 --> 09:53.454
Commander!

09:56.823 --> 09:58.022
Sir, I figured it
would be something

09:58.024 --> 09:59.190
you would want me to do.

09:59.192 --> 10:00.660
Do you know what
an order is?

10:00.662 --> 10:01.892
I do, sir.

10:01.894 --> 10:03.862
You don't do anything
unless I tell you to.

10:03.864 --> 10:05.964
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

10:05.966 --> 10:07.766
You can't take an order
unless it's given.

10:07.768 --> 10:10.703
- Does that make sense, Commander?
- Yes, sir.

10:10.705 --> 10:12.537
I went you to get out
there with Munos,

10:12.539 --> 10:13.972
and I want you
to observe the drones.

10:13.974 --> 10:16.242
But you do not do
anything unless I tell you.

10:16.244 --> 10:17.876
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

10:17.878 --> 10:20.911
This is still my ship.

10:20.913 --> 10:22.383
Dismissed.

10:30.692 --> 10:32.958
How far down is the drone?

10:32.960 --> 10:34.495
Approaching 4000 meters.

10:35.394 --> 10:37.731
Switch to live feed.

10:41.701 --> 10:43.034
What's that, Munos?

10:43.036 --> 10:44.369
Where, ma'am?

10:44.371 --> 10:47.104
Third quadrant?

10:47.106 --> 10:48.707
Did you see that light?

10:48.709 --> 10:51.709
Or was that just a reflection?

10:51.711 --> 10:55.046
Boom.
Right there.

10:55.048 --> 10:57.015
Zoom in.

10:57.017 --> 11:00.419
That looks like a
Borei-II class submarine.

11:00.421 --> 11:02.557
It's been hit.

11:03.423 --> 11:04.723
All right.

11:04.725 --> 11:06.392
Let's get that over
to the Captain.

11:06.394 --> 11:08.960
Sorry to keep you
waiting, Admiral.

11:08.962 --> 11:10.563
You know, there's
a lot of tension

11:10.565 --> 11:12.196
between our countries
right now.

11:12.198 --> 11:14.098
And I don't wanna have to make
a phone call to Congress

11:14.100 --> 11:16.669
over something to do
with Russians, all right?

11:16.671 --> 11:18.302
I understand, sir.
But if it is the Russians...

11:18.304 --> 11:23.242
- And the SPCC.
- Yes, sir.

11:23.244 --> 11:25.276
Yeah, I got a meeting
with the D.O.D.

11:25.278 --> 11:28.613
As soon as I'm done, I'll
check back with you, all right?

11:28.616 --> 11:30.748
Yeah.

11:30.750 --> 11:33.417
So this is your last hurrah?

11:33.419 --> 11:35.653
Yes, sir.
My ass is getting old

11:35.655 --> 11:37.089
and I can't wait
for retirement.

11:37.091 --> 11:38.790
Well, that makes two of us.

11:38.792 --> 11:41.026
Hopefully, we'll be on
the same beach together.

11:43.096 --> 11:48.666
Hey, listen, don't
worry about Lynch.

11:48.668 --> 11:50.068
She's gonna be all right.

11:50.070 --> 11:51.739
Yes, she will, sir.

11:59.613 --> 12:03.147
I mean, it kind
of looks like...

12:03.149 --> 12:05.117
Yeah.

12:05.119 --> 12:07.618
I've never seen
anything like it.

12:07.620 --> 12:09.821
What could do that to a sub?

12:09.823 --> 12:11.692
Torpedo maybe?

12:14.193 --> 12:16.862
Okay.
Then what fired it?

12:16.864 --> 12:20.634
It looks like the sub may
be sealed off at the bulkhead.

12:22.135 --> 12:23.502
So there could be survivors?

12:23.504 --> 12:25.804
In theory.

12:25.806 --> 12:28.973
All right.
I'll take that to the Captain.

12:28.975 --> 12:31.108
- You don't have to.
- Captain on deck!

12:31.110 --> 12:32.109
At ease.

12:32.111 --> 12:33.579
Lynch, come with me.

12:33.581 --> 12:35.414
Vallier, call
my Tactical Actions Officer

12:35.416 --> 12:36.948
- on deck immediately.
- Yes, sir.

12:36.951 --> 12:39.754
- Nice work, everyone.
- Thank you, sir.

12:50.297 --> 12:53.832
Now the only reason they'd be
down there would be espionage.

12:53.834 --> 12:55.300
The Admiral thinks
they're trying to tap

12:55.302 --> 12:57.268
into the Southern Pacific
Communications Cable.

12:57.270 --> 12:58.569
I agree.

12:58.571 --> 12:59.704
Why does that not
surprise me, sir?

12:59.706 --> 13:02.440
Jameson, come join us.

13:02.442 --> 13:04.342
Sir? Ma'am?

13:04.344 --> 13:05.344
Did you get eyes
on that sub?

13:05.346 --> 13:06.545
- We did.
- Russian?

13:06.547 --> 13:07.713
Looks that way.

13:07.715 --> 13:09.348
Should I prep my team?

13:09.350 --> 13:10.916
If we find Russian survivors,
there could be a situation.

13:10.918 --> 13:12.517
Not yet.
Although, have 'em at the ready.

13:12.519 --> 13:14.085
Things could change quick.

13:14.087 --> 13:15.653
Sorry, sir, but if we have
the capabilities to do it,

13:15.655 --> 13:17.188
then we should...

13:17.190 --> 13:18.656
With all due respect,
Commander, there's no guarantee

13:18.658 --> 13:20.257
that anyone's even alive
on that sub.

13:20.260 --> 13:22.160
Right, but there's no
guarantee that no one's not.

13:22.162 --> 13:23.762
Yeah, but they sure as hell
will die if we don't intervene.

13:23.764 --> 13:26.699
Yes, they could.
That's a risk they took.

13:26.701 --> 13:29.334
- Jameson...
- Sorry, sir.

13:29.336 --> 13:31.069
None of that means that
we can't go down there.

13:31.071 --> 13:32.438
I hear you, Commander.

13:32.440 --> 13:34.071
But who knows what the Russians
might bring up with them?

13:34.073 --> 13:35.607
Or what they might do to
protect whatever the hell

13:35.609 --> 13:37.376
they're intercepting
from the SPCC.

13:37.378 --> 13:39.544
But it doesn't mean that
we don't try to rescue them.

13:39.547 --> 13:42.480
Understood.

13:42.482 --> 13:45.950
I'd be willing
to take that risk, sir.

13:45.952 --> 13:47.752
You would.

13:47.754 --> 13:50.888
You'd be willing to risk
your life as well as that

13:50.890 --> 13:52.992
of fellow seamen just
to get in that water?

13:52.994 --> 13:55.594
Yes, sir.
I'd take responsibility.

13:55.596 --> 13:57.094
Well, that's very
brave of you.

13:57.096 --> 13:59.497
But I'm sure you know it
doesn't work that way.

13:59.499 --> 14:02.135
Sir, send me by myself.

14:10.212 --> 14:14.412
Go prep the bell.
You take two with you.

14:14.414 --> 14:16.781
- Yes, sir.
- But you listen to me.

14:16.783 --> 14:18.349
And you listen
to me carefully.

14:18.351 --> 14:20.919
We're gonna send
you down there,

14:20.921 --> 14:22.887
and that's your time.
You own it.

14:22.889 --> 14:24.289
But whatever you bring up
with you,

14:24.291 --> 14:25.957
they're to stay in
the brig until we dock.

14:25.959 --> 14:27.459
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, sir.

14:27.461 --> 14:28.760
I am still the
Captain of this ship.

14:28.762 --> 14:30.429
So whatever I say, goes.
Do you understand?

14:30.431 --> 14:31.429
Yes, sir.

14:31.431 --> 14:33.265
Jameson, prep Mansfield.

14:33.267 --> 14:35.599
Yes, sir.

14:35.602 --> 14:37.802
I want him to be one
of your two.

14:37.804 --> 14:39.204
Thank you, sir.

14:39.206 --> 14:40.675
Dismissed.

15:29.188 --> 15:30.855
Heading down. Over.

15:30.857 --> 15:32.158
Okay.

15:37.498 --> 15:39.097
What's ESDS?

15:39.099 --> 15:41.900
It's Electro-shock
Defense System.

15:41.902 --> 15:43.669
Cheng and I basically
built the inside

15:43.671 --> 15:46.003
of the bell into
a Faraday cage

15:46.005 --> 15:47.906
so we could electroshock
blasts as a defense.

15:47.908 --> 15:49.675
That's amazing.

15:49.677 --> 15:51.676
So that's what the lines
running outside are.

15:51.678 --> 15:53.310
The problem is,
I wasn't able to hook it

15:53.313 --> 15:54.780
to the battery reserve.

15:54.782 --> 15:56.547
All right, let's keep
it tight, Lynch.

15:56.549 --> 15:58.215
I always do, Captain.

15:58.217 --> 16:02.320
And don't get too cocky
down there if we can help it.

16:02.322 --> 16:03.591
Yes, sir.

16:49.036 --> 16:50.738
Captain, are you seeing this?

16:52.471 --> 16:56.507
What am I looking at?

16:56.509 --> 16:58.343
I mean, it looks like...

16:58.345 --> 17:00.945
Like a bite mark?

17:00.947 --> 17:03.449
Just what I was thinking.

17:03.451 --> 17:06.050
What has a bite that big?

17:06.053 --> 17:07.722
No idea.

17:09.021 --> 17:11.021
Closing in and
engaging with sub.

17:11.023 --> 17:12.893
Affirmative.
Take it easy.

17:19.333 --> 17:21.002
We are aligned.

17:23.435 --> 17:24.835
Contact.

17:24.837 --> 17:26.872
Munos, confirm airlock
to the sub.

17:26.874 --> 17:28.140
Confirmed.
We are locked.

17:28.142 --> 17:31.011
- We're on.
- Copy that.

17:42.956 --> 17:46.259
Bell's hatch is open,
moving on to the sub hatch.

17:52.966 --> 17:54.334
Do you see anything?

18:01.807 --> 18:03.176
No, sir, nothing.

18:06.413 --> 18:08.514
Oh, my God.

18:08.517 --> 18:09.747
Does anybody speak English?

18:09.749 --> 18:11.016
I do.

18:11.018 --> 18:13.852
- Is anyone hurt?
- All others dead.

18:13.854 --> 18:15.823
Come up, come up.

18:17.825 --> 18:20.227
Get in!
Get in now!

18:33.105 --> 18:35.006
Lynch!
Are you okay?

18:35.008 --> 18:37.244
Munos, get ready
to detach on my command!

18:40.680 --> 18:42.316
Lynch! Commander!
Come in!

18:44.085 --> 18:45.551
Set!

18:45.554 --> 18:49.990
Now!

18:55.394 --> 18:56.329
Lynch!

18:57.397 --> 18:58.529
Okay, sir!

18:58.531 --> 19:00.467
We detached just before
the sub collapsed!

19:02.836 --> 19:04.201
How many did you get?

19:04.203 --> 19:06.904
Three.
They all look pretty rough,

19:06.906 --> 19:08.875
but no one seems to be injured.

19:11.811 --> 19:13.745
What happened to you
all down there?

19:13.747 --> 19:15.780
We were attacked.

19:15.782 --> 19:17.716
Attacked?
By what?

19:17.718 --> 19:21.885
I think a shark.

19:21.887 --> 19:25.957
- A what?
- Did she say shark?

19:25.959 --> 19:28.062
Yes, shark.
Big one.

19:29.597 --> 19:30.996
Okay.

19:30.998 --> 19:32.130
Wanna tell me what
you were doing down there

19:32.132 --> 19:33.699
in the first place?

19:33.701 --> 19:34.732
Well, we were...

19:34.734 --> 19:37.536
We do whaling, shark survey.

19:37.538 --> 19:40.438
We need to get up... quickly.

19:40.440 --> 19:42.074
Is not good down here.

19:42.076 --> 19:45.643
So that's your story?
Shark surveying?

19:45.645 --> 19:47.578
Of course.

19:47.580 --> 19:52.151
We must get out of water
before the shark find us again.

19:52.153 --> 19:53.718
You're lucky we picked
you up on sonar.

19:53.720 --> 19:55.187
I'll take you back up,

19:55.189 --> 19:56.321
but you're gonna have
to do better than that

19:56.323 --> 19:58.793
for the Captain.
Mansfield?

20:01.094 --> 20:02.960
Keep an eye on our... whalers.

20:02.962 --> 20:04.932
Yes, ma'am.

20:08.501 --> 20:10.302
All right, Daniels.
Bring us up.

20:10.304 --> 20:16.274
Captain, the Russians
are saying it was a shark.

20:16.277 --> 20:19.209
Wait! A shark?
You said it was a shark?

20:19.211 --> 20:20.612
Yeah.

20:20.614 --> 20:22.145
Are you sure? Did you check
your systems, your sonar?

20:22.147 --> 20:24.748
Yes.
It's obviously B.S.

20:24.750 --> 20:27.584
There's not a shark big enough
to do that type of damage.

20:27.586 --> 20:29.520
Well, my guess is
we're not the first ones

20:29.522 --> 20:30.988
to spot these guys.

20:30.990 --> 20:33.524
Somebody probably shot at 'em
and left 'em for dead.

20:33.526 --> 20:35.026
Captain!

20:35.028 --> 20:36.163
What is it?

20:40.499 --> 20:41.966
Right there!

20:41.968 --> 20:43.669
What am I looking at?

20:43.671 --> 20:44.902
What is it? Sub?

20:44.904 --> 20:46.670
Not sure, sir.

20:46.672 --> 20:47.971
I need you to be sure!

20:47.973 --> 20:49.509
Yes, sir, Captain.

20:55.182 --> 20:57.151
Hey, Lynch, are you
seeing anything down there?

20:59.618 --> 21:02.187
No, sir, nothing.

21:02.189 --> 21:04.624
Checking monitoring again.

21:06.859 --> 21:08.229
There!

21:11.565 --> 21:12.997
Wait, Captain.

21:12.999 --> 21:14.632
I think I see something.

21:14.634 --> 21:16.767
Could it be whatever fired
on the Russians?

21:16.769 --> 21:19.770
Maybe, sir, but I don't know.

21:19.772 --> 21:21.539
It's blocking all my monitors.

21:21.541 --> 21:23.040
Oh, my God.

21:23.042 --> 21:24.377
What is it, Lynch?

21:34.254 --> 21:35.353
Lynch, come in!
Are you there?

21:35.355 --> 21:37.057
Let me try to fix this now.

21:41.027 --> 21:42.760
- Try it again.
- What happened, Lynch?

21:42.762 --> 21:44.027
Do you copy?

21:44.029 --> 21:47.198
It's a shark, sir!

21:47.200 --> 21:49.270
It's a massive shark!

21:53.772 --> 21:55.739
Lynch, are you okay?

21:55.741 --> 21:57.007
Damn it!

21:57.009 --> 21:58.442
I don't care what
you have to do.

21:58.444 --> 22:00.045
I want you to find 'em.
Do you understand me?

22:00.047 --> 22:01.448
Yes, sir.

22:28.240 --> 22:29.340
Stay away from that
thing, damn it!

22:29.342 --> 22:31.709
Captain on the deck!

22:31.711 --> 22:33.244
What happened?

22:33.246 --> 22:34.648
Something has the bell, sir!

22:36.683 --> 22:38.248
What do we do, Commander?

22:38.250 --> 22:40.653
Hold on.
Everybody, hold on!

22:49.561 --> 22:51.461
Status?

22:51.463 --> 22:53.430
Cable won't come up, sir!

22:53.432 --> 22:55.333
That's not acceptable, Cheng!

22:55.335 --> 22:57.000
I gotta get this
thing up here!

22:57.002 --> 22:58.269
We tried to retract it,

22:58.271 --> 22:59.937
but the counterpressure
is too much!

22:59.939 --> 23:02.073
What if we gun the ship
in the opposite direction?

23:02.075 --> 23:06.178
If we had more power, maybe.
But we've lost secondary power!

23:06.180 --> 23:08.249
We have to blow the cable!

23:11.084 --> 23:14.488
Communications are dead!
Propulsion's offline too!

23:25.699 --> 23:27.634
Munos, take over!

23:33.306 --> 23:35.506
What did you do to get
the shark to let go of you?

23:35.508 --> 23:36.641
Nothing.

23:36.643 --> 23:39.811
Nothing?
Do I look like an idiot to you?

23:39.813 --> 23:41.515
Tell me now!

23:50.857 --> 23:52.657
We're gonna blow the cable!

23:52.659 --> 23:55.325
They'll all die
down there, Captain!

23:55.327 --> 23:56.594
If we don't blow the cable,
so will we!

23:56.596 --> 23:58.328
We don't have any other option!

23:58.330 --> 24:00.497
- Blow it!
- Sir...?

24:00.499 --> 24:03.133
We have no other option!

24:03.135 --> 24:04.637
Blow it!

24:23.355 --> 24:24.555
Hey, what just happened?

24:24.557 --> 24:25.957
- I think they cut us loose.
- What?

24:25.959 --> 24:27.758
Vallier?
Do you read me?

24:27.760 --> 24:29.192
Vallier!

24:29.194 --> 24:31.729
Mansfield, get to the back.
Watch them!

24:31.731 --> 24:33.333
Yes, ma'am.

24:41.074 --> 24:45.209
What was that?

24:45.211 --> 24:48.011
That was the shark
swallowing us.

24:48.013 --> 24:49.380
No, no, this
can't be happening! If we...

24:49.382 --> 24:50.480
- Enough!
- We're dead!

24:50.482 --> 24:52.683
Munos, I need a report!

24:52.685 --> 24:54.786
Okay.
We're losing power.

24:54.788 --> 24:57.020
Oxygen 90%,
but it's not gonna last.

24:57.022 --> 24:59.323
Kill all nonessential power.
We need to conserve.

24:59.325 --> 25:00.624
What do we have then?

25:00.627 --> 25:04.593
Maybe... I don't know.
Half an hour?

25:04.595 --> 25:06.200
Munos, I'll be back.

25:16.976 --> 25:21.813
Times' up, sweetheart.
I need to know everything now.

25:21.815 --> 25:23.882
Sir, there's
only one blip now.

25:23.884 --> 25:25.949
I think the shark
swallowed the bell.

25:25.951 --> 25:27.985
You're kidding me!
Can you reach them?

25:27.987 --> 25:29.688
We have to make contact.

25:29.690 --> 25:31.421
Give me something.

25:31.423 --> 25:32.757
I'm trying sir.
I really am.

25:32.759 --> 25:34.459
But nothing seems
to be coming through.

25:34.461 --> 25:35.625
Can we get a signal at least?

25:35.627 --> 25:37.261
Negative, sir.
That's dead too.

25:37.263 --> 25:38.630
Look. I don't care what
you have to do.

25:38.632 --> 25:40.064
But I need you to get
those comms working.

25:40.066 --> 25:41.199
Do you understand me?

25:41.201 --> 25:42.799
Sir!
We need you over here!

25:42.801 --> 25:44.602
It's urgent, sir.

25:44.604 --> 25:49.039
Find a way 'cause your
seamen are counting on you.

25:49.041 --> 25:50.776
Let's go.

25:53.380 --> 25:54.582
Yes, sir.

25:55.615 --> 25:57.347
I asked you a question.

25:57.349 --> 25:58.548
It was the sound of
our drill...

25:58.550 --> 26:00.151
- Yana...?
- Your drill?

26:00.153 --> 26:02.786
You ever hear of whale watchers
who use a drill, Mansfield?

26:02.788 --> 26:03.787
No, ma'am.

26:03.789 --> 26:05.122
Yeah, me either.
Cut the crap.

26:05.124 --> 26:06.658
I'm telling the truth.

26:06.660 --> 26:09.494
We were using our
high-speed drill.

26:09.496 --> 26:12.497
And it seemed to draw
the shark upon us...

26:14.467 --> 26:15.533
Hey! Drop it now!

26:15.535 --> 26:17.168
No, I don't think so.

26:17.170 --> 26:18.635
There is no more talking
to be done.

26:18.637 --> 26:19.970
You understand?
We're going up!

26:19.973 --> 26:20.970
- We can't...
- Now!

26:20.973 --> 26:22.672
We can't go up!

26:22.674 --> 26:24.409
We're stuck inside
whatever attacked your sub,

26:24.411 --> 26:26.143
And if you don't help us, then
this is where we end right now!

26:26.145 --> 26:28.412
Then it is where
it should end.

26:28.414 --> 26:30.780
And I start with this traitor.

26:33.819 --> 26:35.489
Grab the gun.

26:36.388 --> 26:37.755
- Mansfield?
- Mm-hmm?

26:37.757 --> 26:38.823
Tie him up!

26:38.825 --> 26:40.024
Yes, ma'am.
Get your hands up.

26:40.026 --> 26:41.226
Get your hands up.

26:41.228 --> 26:42.626
And you need to sit
back down, huh?

26:42.629 --> 26:46.131
Just put your hands behind
your back, broski.

26:46.133 --> 26:49.267
So how do we get out
of a shark's stomach?

26:49.270 --> 26:52.536
If we can get the ESDS
back online,

26:52.538 --> 26:54.338
I think we can shock the
inner lining of its belly

26:54.340 --> 26:55.773
and get it to regurgitate us.

26:55.775 --> 26:57.275
Do you think that'll work?

26:57.278 --> 27:00.647
I don't know,
but I'm gonna try.

27:17.997 --> 27:20.131
That should allow
the electricity to pass through

27:20.133 --> 27:21.966
to the shock rods
on the outside.

27:21.968 --> 27:23.537
Let's test it out.

27:27.774 --> 27:30.040
I'm gonna ram us into
the side of the shark.

27:30.042 --> 27:31.308
Be ready to hit that button.

27:31.311 --> 27:33.076
Yes, ma'am.

27:33.078 --> 27:34.280
Here we go.

27:37.585 --> 27:38.518
Now!

27:44.390 --> 27:45.757
What was that?

27:45.759 --> 27:47.792
There goes the rest
of our battery reserves.

27:47.794 --> 27:50.928
Did it work?

27:50.930 --> 27:52.298
No, it didn't.

27:58.570 --> 28:00.337
All right, what's
the status on that bell?

28:00.339 --> 28:04.843
Just prepping sonar one.

28:04.845 --> 28:08.078
Can be ready...
it's sinking, sir.

28:08.080 --> 28:09.979
The shark is heading
down to deep water.

28:09.982 --> 28:11.749
It won't be able to
survive the pressure.

28:11.751 --> 28:12.882
But if we cut...

28:12.884 --> 28:15.251
Look, we gotta get
the ship up and running.

28:15.253 --> 28:17.054
And then what, sir?

28:17.056 --> 28:18.488
And then we save her.

28:18.490 --> 28:20.493
Then we save her.

28:26.832 --> 28:28.333
Commander, I don't like
this pressure change.

28:28.335 --> 28:29.967
- If we go any deeper...
- I know.

28:29.969 --> 28:30.968
I feel it too.

28:30.970 --> 28:32.169
How long do we have?

28:32.171 --> 28:34.138
That doesn't change anything.

28:34.140 --> 28:36.775
You will not save us.
We will all die down here.

28:36.777 --> 28:39.876
Not if the United States Navy
has anything to say about it.

28:41.247 --> 28:42.779
I'm sorry, but I'm not
sharing your optimism

28:42.781 --> 28:44.882
about abilities of the
United States...

28:44.884 --> 28:46.517
You better watch your
mouth when you're talking

28:46.519 --> 28:48.987
about the Navy.

29:01.901 --> 29:03.167
Engines?

29:03.169 --> 29:05.135
Still dead, but if we can
get the lines clear,

29:05.137 --> 29:06.738
maybe we'll get something.

29:06.740 --> 29:08.538
Pumps are running
on battery power.

29:08.540 --> 29:09.974
But we'll tear through
that soon enough.

29:09.976 --> 29:12.276
Save it.
It's not gonna help us. Comms?

29:12.278 --> 29:13.644
That's dead too, sir.

29:13.646 --> 29:15.647
The power surge fried a
lot of the equipment.

29:15.649 --> 29:18.149
But sonar is still operational.

29:18.151 --> 29:20.384
It's just running on batteries.

29:20.386 --> 29:21.986
Okay. That we'll need.

29:21.988 --> 29:23.554
Keep that thing up
and running.

29:23.556 --> 29:25.088
I wanna know where
it is at all times.

29:25.090 --> 29:26.423
Okay.

29:26.425 --> 29:29.326
- What about Morse Code?
- Not sure, sir.

29:29.328 --> 29:33.063
I mean, it's routinely
maintained, so it should work.

29:33.065 --> 29:34.832
How do we even know
if Lynch equipped

29:34.834 --> 29:36.167
the bell with a telegraph?

29:36.169 --> 29:37.869
Well, knowing Lynch,
she probably did.

29:37.871 --> 29:40.604
All right,
let's give it a shot.

29:40.607 --> 29:41.838
It's all we got.

29:41.840 --> 29:43.740
You work on
that Morse Code for me.

29:43.742 --> 29:45.412
- Copy that.
- Dismissed.

29:48.047 --> 29:51.181
Why don't you just
tell me the truth, hmm?

29:51.183 --> 29:54.184
What were you doing down there?

29:54.186 --> 29:56.420
We're all gonna die down here.
Then what does it matter?

29:57.691 --> 30:01.592
Something funny about
that, Natasha?

30:01.594 --> 30:03.928
You Americans are
all the same.

30:03.930 --> 30:06.997
No respect for anyone
but selves.

30:06.999 --> 30:08.699
And you Russians are
all dirty, stinking...

30:08.701 --> 30:14.337
Hey! Hey, why don't
you just tell me?

30:14.339 --> 30:17.676
What did you do there for
the shark to leave you alone?

30:18.544 --> 30:21.746
I told you. Nothing.

30:21.748 --> 30:25.682
We use drill.
Shark come, destroy sub.

30:25.684 --> 30:27.084
And what happened
to the drill?

30:27.086 --> 30:30.587
Drill destroyed too.
It slipped off cable.

30:30.589 --> 30:32.222
So you were drilling
into the SPCC?

30:32.224 --> 30:35.892
What are you after, hmm?
What is your mission?

30:35.894 --> 30:39.395
Told you.
We are whalers.

30:39.397 --> 30:41.766
We were performing
a shark survey.

30:41.768 --> 30:43.100
Hey, Munos?
Do I like liars?

30:43.102 --> 30:45.035
- No, ma'am, you do not.
- No, I do not.

30:45.037 --> 30:46.469
So I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

30:46.471 --> 30:48.074
What is your mission?

30:51.744 --> 30:53.043
We are whalers.

30:53.045 --> 30:56.716
We're performing
a shark survey.

31:14.767 --> 31:17.101
Okay, will this thing work?

31:17.103 --> 31:18.670
Well, I'm sending a signal.
But I'm not receiving.

31:18.672 --> 31:19.871
Okay, please.

31:19.873 --> 31:22.206
Lynch is counting
on all of us.

31:22.208 --> 31:23.207
Do your best.

31:23.209 --> 31:24.776
- Sir?
- Yeah?

31:24.778 --> 31:26.610
Sir, the Admiral asks to
see you on the signal deck.

31:26.613 --> 31:28.011
Okay.
Bring Jameson up with you.

31:28.013 --> 31:29.513
I don't want
to keep him waiting.

31:29.515 --> 31:31.082
- Copy.
- Look. Get it done.

31:31.084 --> 31:32.219
Copy that.

31:40.160 --> 31:42.559
Admiral on deck!

31:42.561 --> 31:47.096
As you were, gentlemen.

31:47.098 --> 31:52.370
Captain, I heard about
the loss of Lynch.

31:52.372 --> 31:56.407
Never easy losing a soldier,
and she was a good one.

31:56.409 --> 31:57.674
There's no answer for it.

31:57.676 --> 31:59.309
I think you did the right thing.

31:59.311 --> 32:01.578
With all due respect, sir,
we haven't lost them yet.

32:01.580 --> 32:03.613
With all due respect
to you, Captain,

32:03.615 --> 32:05.114
they were swallowed by a shark.
I mean...

32:05.116 --> 32:06.784
Well, you're not trying
to tell me

32:06.786 --> 32:09.019
that you're contemplating
a rescue, are you?

32:09.021 --> 32:13.056
That's exactly
what I'm saying.

32:13.058 --> 32:15.026
If you want to put the men
and women on this ship

32:15.028 --> 32:18.828
in harm's way, I'd have to find
that to be gross incompetence.

32:18.830 --> 32:20.997
Sir, this is still my ship.

32:20.999 --> 32:23.000
If there's men and women are
still alive down there,

32:23.002 --> 32:24.201
I'm gonna do everything
I can to save them

32:24.203 --> 32:26.003
with or without your
permission, sir.

32:26.005 --> 32:28.671
Well, that's true.
This is your ship.

32:28.674 --> 32:30.607
And you are in command.

32:30.609 --> 32:31.776
And you don't need
my permission.

32:31.778 --> 32:33.044
That's correct, sir.

32:33.046 --> 32:35.846
Except in the event of...

32:35.848 --> 32:38.283
what would that be, Ensign
Burkhead, in the event of what?

32:38.285 --> 32:39.750
Sir?

32:39.752 --> 32:41.786
He's in command
unless in the event of...

32:41.788 --> 32:44.020
In the event of gross
negligence towards the ship,

32:44.022 --> 32:45.856
the lives of
the sailors onboard

32:45.858 --> 32:47.391
or the protection
of state secrets.

32:47.393 --> 32:49.927
You leave me no choice
if you're gonna continue

32:49.929 --> 32:52.795
on this course but to
relieve you of command

32:52.797 --> 32:54.300
and put you in the brig.

32:59.572 --> 33:03.039
So, Jameson, take this
man to the brig.

33:03.041 --> 33:07.344
Sir, there's men and women
still alive down there!

33:07.346 --> 33:12.049
It's a casualty of war,
Captain, and we're at war.

33:12.051 --> 33:15.622
I mean, I would think you of all
people would understand that.

33:18.290 --> 33:20.859
All right, Jameson,
take him away.

33:24.064 --> 33:27.296
Is there a problem, Jameson?

33:27.298 --> 33:28.599
Yes, sir, there is.

33:28.601 --> 33:30.167
What would that be?

33:30.169 --> 33:32.570
Respectfully, sir,
I don't take orders from you.

33:32.572 --> 33:33.970
You might be an Admiral.

33:33.972 --> 33:35.538
But while you're aboard
this ship,

33:35.540 --> 33:37.607
you don't have the authority
to take over command.

33:37.609 --> 33:40.411
Well, I most certainly do.

33:40.413 --> 33:42.915
Not if you're the only one
who thinks so, sir.

33:49.121 --> 33:53.360
Burkhead, you take both of
them to the brig right now.

33:58.396 --> 34:00.264
Is this really how you
guys wanna play this?

34:00.266 --> 34:03.199
You're willing to risk
your futures on a whim?

34:03.201 --> 34:05.001
Your military careers
are gonna be over

34:05.003 --> 34:08.038
even before they started.
All for what?

34:08.040 --> 34:13.275
For the lives of three sailors
that might already be dead?

34:13.277 --> 34:15.782
They'd do the same
for us, sir.

34:17.683 --> 34:21.085
Jameson, make sure the Admiral
is comfortable in his quarters.

34:23.121 --> 34:27.324
Take your hands off me.
Let go.

34:27.326 --> 34:30.327
You're all defying
a direct order.

34:30.329 --> 34:31.996
Every single one of
you on this bridge

34:31.998 --> 34:33.630
could be court-martialed
for what you're doing.

34:33.632 --> 34:35.065
Do you realize that?

34:35.068 --> 34:37.900
You do what you think
is necessary, sir.

34:37.902 --> 34:40.871
Sir, please?

34:40.873 --> 34:42.342
I'm sorry, sir.

34:53.818 --> 34:55.251
That's enough standing around.

34:55.253 --> 34:57.354
Let's go save our officers!

34:57.356 --> 34:59.356
Treadwell.

34:59.358 --> 35:00.825
Guard his door.

35:00.827 --> 35:02.295
Yes, sir!

35:10.670 --> 35:12.405
Getting something.

35:22.947 --> 35:24.581
Sir, they received
the message.

35:24.583 --> 35:26.516
Okay, so they're alive now.

35:26.518 --> 35:27.885
Thank God.

35:27.887 --> 35:30.054
Okay, I need ideas now.

35:30.056 --> 35:31.588
- Well...
- Sir?

35:31.590 --> 35:33.092
- Yeah?
- I think I have one.

35:38.264 --> 35:40.664
Okay, Cheng, so explain
this to me again.

35:40.666 --> 35:42.967
Well, sir, it's commonly
thought that certain species

35:42.969 --> 35:44.735
of sharks can smell
a drop of blood

35:44.737 --> 35:47.537
- from up to 500 meters away.
- Okay.

35:47.539 --> 35:50.206
So it's safe to say
that whatever

35:50.208 --> 35:51.909
we're dealing with is
anything but typical.

35:51.911 --> 35:53.510
Okay, so what's your point?

35:53.512 --> 35:57.514
My point is this creature
is capable of sensing blood

35:57.516 --> 36:00.583
from distances astronomically
larger than that.

36:00.585 --> 36:04.022
Cheng, what do you think
this thing might be?

36:07.059 --> 36:09.427
A Megalodon, sir.

36:09.429 --> 36:11.161
A prehistoric creature
that hasn't been seen

36:11.163 --> 36:12.628
in a couple of million years.

36:12.630 --> 36:14.999
Then you're talking
about the Megalodon?

36:15.001 --> 36:17.967
Yes, sir.

36:17.970 --> 36:20.336
I thought that thing
only existed in myth.

36:20.339 --> 36:23.740
No, sir. Just extinct
is all, or so we thought.

36:23.742 --> 36:25.508
- Sir?
- Yeah, what is it?

36:25.510 --> 36:26.881
Right this way.

36:29.280 --> 36:34.420
Hey, Cheng, why are
we in the galley?

36:40.025 --> 36:42.092
- Commander?
- What is it?

36:42.094 --> 36:44.327
- I'm getting another message.
- What are they saying?

36:44.329 --> 36:46.930
"Hang tight. We got a plan
to bring you up.

36:46.932 --> 36:48.798
There will be blood."
Rep?

36:48.800 --> 36:51.869
Send this back.
"Oxygen at 60%.

36:51.871 --> 36:53.269
"Power close to critical.

36:53.271 --> 36:55.938
"Pressure increasing,
but bearable for now.

36:55.940 --> 36:57.374
Thank you, Captain."

36:57.376 --> 37:00.478
The battery reserve?
What do we have?

37:00.480 --> 37:03.914
Not much.

37:03.916 --> 37:05.451
Then I sure hope they hurry.

37:08.987 --> 37:10.621
I left checks on aisle one.

37:10.623 --> 37:11.988
Okay, where are they, Vallier?

37:11.990 --> 37:13.590
It's very hard to say, sir.

37:13.592 --> 37:15.592
The shark is heading down
to deep water laterally, but...

37:15.594 --> 37:17.994
- But what?
- It's just not right, sir.

37:17.996 --> 37:19.362
Explain that.

37:19.364 --> 37:21.599
Well, it just has
an odd pattern to it.

37:21.601 --> 37:26.838
A odd moving pattern to it.

37:26.840 --> 37:28.005
Where's the nearest
land mass?

37:28.007 --> 37:29.673
That would be Hawaii, sir.

37:29.675 --> 37:32.976
It's a thousand miles
on the northeast.

37:32.978 --> 37:34.543
- Okay. Jameson?
- Sir?

37:34.545 --> 37:36.612
Time to prep your team.
Have them at the ready.

37:36.614 --> 37:38.347
We're gonna lure the shark
back up to the ship.

37:38.349 --> 37:39.782
It's not gonna like
what's waiting for it.

37:39.784 --> 37:42.385
Yes, sir. Should I prep
the artillery guns?

37:42.387 --> 37:43.753
It wouldn't do any good
unless we get

37:43.755 --> 37:45.088
a good distance
between us and it.

37:45.090 --> 37:46.590
Most likely, sir.

37:46.593 --> 37:48.191
But it couldn't hurt
to have 'em ready.

37:48.193 --> 37:49.860
True.

37:49.862 --> 37:51.561
Okay, let's prep
the artillery.

37:51.563 --> 37:53.396
Make sure the sideboard guns
are working.

37:53.398 --> 37:54.831
We'll see if we get a good
line of sight from there.

37:54.833 --> 37:56.099
Yes, sir.

37:56.101 --> 37:57.133
- Burkhead?
- Sir!

37:57.135 --> 37:58.334
Have your men on standby.

37:58.337 --> 37:59.869
Be ready to deploy
the lifeboats.

37:59.871 --> 38:01.405
Once that thing comes up,
we're only gonna have

38:01.407 --> 38:03.007
a few minutes to get it off
the diving bell.

38:03.009 --> 38:04.307
You got it, sir.
I'll get 'em out.

38:04.309 --> 38:06.010
Choose three men
to go with you.

38:06.012 --> 38:08.445
Yes, sir.

38:08.447 --> 38:09.646
Sir?

38:09.648 --> 38:12.952
May I ask how you plan on
luring the shark?

38:16.856 --> 38:18.655
Here it is.

38:18.657 --> 38:20.492
That's all the steak
we got on the ship.

38:25.030 --> 38:26.697
- Such a waste.
- Yep.

38:26.699 --> 38:30.501
Then it's beans and rice for
the next six months, fellas.

38:30.503 --> 38:31.334
Thank you, Morris.

38:31.336 --> 38:32.668
You sure this is gonna work?

38:32.670 --> 38:35.039
Not at all, but in theory,
it should...

38:35.041 --> 38:36.340
So, what?

38:36.342 --> 38:37.673
We just throw this
bag of chow in the water

38:37.675 --> 38:39.409
and wait for the shark
to take the bait?

38:39.411 --> 38:40.677
Pretty much.

38:40.679 --> 38:42.378
Cheng, what are we doing
about the electricity?

38:42.380 --> 38:44.146
Well, sir, we're about
to hook it up right now.

38:44.148 --> 38:46.282
It's semi-based on what
we did with the bell.

38:46.284 --> 38:47.885
Didn't Lynch say that
wasn't gonna work?

38:47.887 --> 38:49.186
This will, sir.

38:49.188 --> 38:50.387
Well, I don't wanna
fry the last bit

38:50.389 --> 38:52.222
of what this ship
currently has.

38:52.224 --> 38:54.257
That's really where
CS Morris comes in, sir.

38:54.259 --> 38:56.894
He retrofitted his galley
to run entirely off

38:56.896 --> 38:58.461
of DC power instead of gas.

38:58.463 --> 39:01.530
So we have an entirely
self-contained system?

39:01.532 --> 39:04.267
Yep. And the ship
remains unaffected.

39:04.269 --> 39:08.104
Morris, when we dock, remind
me to get you a promotion.

39:08.106 --> 39:09.139
Yes, sir!

39:09.141 --> 39:10.775
All right.

39:10.777 --> 39:12.242
But the galley doesn't
have the same amount of energy

39:12.244 --> 39:13.878
that the entire ship has.

39:13.880 --> 39:16.412
That's correct, sir, but
it should give us at least

39:16.414 --> 39:19.516
30 seconds of killer juice
before it fries everything.

39:19.518 --> 39:22.151
Then we're cooking our
meals over an open fire.

39:22.153 --> 39:26.490
Okay, all right,
let's see what we got.

39:26.492 --> 39:28.394
Hit it!

39:34.467 --> 39:35.632
It works!

39:35.634 --> 39:36.833
Nice work, everyone.

39:36.835 --> 39:38.168
Cheng, no matter what,

39:38.170 --> 39:40.938
do not flip that switch
unless I tell you.

39:40.940 --> 39:42.304
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, sir.

39:42.306 --> 39:43.807
Make sure our sailors
are safe.

39:43.809 --> 39:46.409
All right, let's get
that thing in the water.

39:46.411 --> 39:48.080
Dismissed.

40:27.353 --> 40:28.251
Status!

40:28.253 --> 40:29.353
It's closing in on it, sir!

40:29.355 --> 40:30.854
It seems to have taken the bait!

40:30.856 --> 40:32.988
- Cheng, are you ready?
- All ready on deck, sir!

40:32.990 --> 40:34.523
Waiting for your command!

40:34.525 --> 40:35.592
Jameson?

40:35.594 --> 40:36.626
Ready here, sir!

40:36.628 --> 40:40.530
Let's light this
son of a bitch up!

40:40.532 --> 40:42.532
Vallier, did you get
the message to Lynch?

40:42.534 --> 40:44.034
Sure did, sir.

40:44.036 --> 40:46.769
Good!
Everybody be ready!

40:46.771 --> 40:48.141
Let's go!

40:49.240 --> 40:50.574
I'm getting something
else here.

40:50.576 --> 40:52.575
- What's it say?
- "Be ready to move.

40:52.577 --> 40:53.943
You'll know your window
when you see it."

40:53.945 --> 40:55.177
All right.
Thank you, Munos.

40:55.179 --> 40:57.179
Mansfield!
Hold it down back there!

40:57.181 --> 40:58.816
This could get rough!

40:58.818 --> 41:01.086
What are we going to do?
Drive out?

41:02.655 --> 41:05.057
That's exactly
what we're gonna do.

41:08.260 --> 41:14.264
It's right below us, sir.

41:14.266 --> 41:16.833
- There!
- This is it!

41:16.835 --> 41:19.202
Get me everything
she's got, Munos!

41:19.204 --> 41:23.874
Get me everything she's got!

41:23.876 --> 41:26.211
Come on!

41:31.550 --> 41:34.418
Everything she's got!

41:34.420 --> 41:36.052
Do I have two
separate pings yet?

41:36.054 --> 41:40.990
Not yet, sir, but we should
have impact in three, two...

41:53.139 --> 41:54.774
Oh!

41:57.074 --> 41:58.710
That is how you drive!

42:06.018 --> 42:07.650
Sir, I have them on sonar.

42:07.653 --> 42:09.653
- Confirm again, soldier.
- Yes, sir.

42:09.656 --> 42:11.257
I have two separate
pings right there.

42:15.793 --> 42:16.795
There!

42:23.869 --> 42:25.168
Welcome back, Commander.

42:25.170 --> 42:26.436
Looks like
you've been through it.

42:26.438 --> 42:27.871
Nice to see you
too, Burkhead.

42:27.873 --> 42:29.472
That ride for us?

42:29.474 --> 42:30.809
Yes, ma'am.

42:35.681 --> 42:38.818
We got 'em.
Sir, we got 'em!

42:40.385 --> 42:42.219
All right,
good job, soldiers.

42:42.221 --> 42:43.653
But we're not out
of this yet!

42:43.655 --> 42:45.555
Chang, as soon as
everybody's onboard,

42:45.557 --> 42:47.724
I want you to fry that thing!
You understand me?

42:47.726 --> 42:48.927
Yes, sir.

42:51.230 --> 42:54.199
Burkhead!

42:59.672 --> 43:01.472
Okay, everyone, this is it!

43:01.474 --> 43:03.840
No matter what happens,
let's bring our sailors home!

43:03.842 --> 43:05.311
Hooyah!

43:12.483 --> 43:15.922
- Man overboard!
- Man overboard!

43:20.659 --> 43:22.425
Two in the water!
Grab the rope!

43:22.427 --> 43:23.828
Grab the rope!

43:45.184 --> 43:46.182
She's on!

43:46.184 --> 43:47.284
Jameson, are they clear?

43:47.287 --> 43:48.351
Not yet, sir!

43:48.353 --> 43:50.186
- Cheng, are you ready?
- Ready!

43:50.188 --> 43:51.557
Wait for my command.

44:05.137 --> 44:07.137
All clear! All clear!

44:07.139 --> 44:08.341
Light it up!

44:35.800 --> 44:37.536
Shut it down!

44:44.977 --> 44:46.842
Mansfield!

44:57.123 --> 45:00.458
Cut the cable!
Cut the cable!

46:08.793 --> 46:10.559
Thanks.

46:10.561 --> 46:12.329
And a private suite
for Ivanov.

46:12.331 --> 46:14.563
It's pronounced ee-van-ov.

46:14.565 --> 46:17.032
- And for you, Captain Ivanov.
- Okay, Captain.

46:17.034 --> 46:22.438
Well, we're gonna get to
know each other real well.

46:22.440 --> 46:24.673
All right, comrades,
party's over.

46:24.675 --> 46:26.577
Sir, I think we
should question Popov.

46:26.579 --> 46:28.244
Let me question Ivanov first.

46:28.246 --> 46:30.347
But, sir, she has information
on the mission

46:30.349 --> 46:33.148
about what they were actually
doing down there.

46:33.150 --> 46:34.617
And she's frightened.

46:34.619 --> 46:36.253
I think I can get her to talk.

46:36.256 --> 46:37.987
I can hear you, you know.

46:37.990 --> 46:41.090
I speak American,
or did you forget?

46:41.092 --> 46:41.992
Am I wrong?

46:41.994 --> 46:43.726
Okay, we'll question Popov.

46:43.728 --> 46:45.461
Let me get Ivanov
first, all right?

46:45.463 --> 46:46.996
Yes, sir.

46:46.999 --> 46:48.731
Jameson, bring them inside.
Bring him down below.

46:48.733 --> 46:50.702
I'll be there in one minute.
Lynch, you come with me.

46:56.306 --> 46:58.340
So where do we stand?

46:58.342 --> 47:01.177
Well, sir, the bell's
being brought onboard, sir.

47:01.179 --> 47:02.778
I can see that. What else?

47:02.780 --> 47:04.313
The trap drained most of
the power from the galley.

47:04.315 --> 47:07.016
I was able to get
comms back online, though.

47:07.019 --> 47:08.184
Okay, good.

47:08.186 --> 47:09.887
Were you able to send
the transmission?

47:09.889 --> 47:11.220
Yes, sir, but it doesn't
look like

47:11.222 --> 47:12.889
we're gonna get help
any time soon.

47:12.891 --> 47:15.557
Of course not.
How we looking on this shark?

47:15.559 --> 47:18.260
Well, sir, it seems to
have taken the bait.

47:18.262 --> 47:19.965
The sonar's pretty clear.

47:22.201 --> 47:24.635
Cheng, I need you to find
a way if this thing comes back

47:24.637 --> 47:26.970
- to come up with a plan, okay?
- Yes, sir.

47:26.972 --> 47:29.037
Lynch, I want you
to guard the bridge.

47:29.040 --> 47:31.608
Jameson and I are going
to question Ivanov.

47:31.610 --> 47:33.008
Sir, I can...

47:33.010 --> 47:36.679
Commander, you almost
died today.

47:36.682 --> 47:38.315
I want you to take
a deep breath

47:38.318 --> 47:41.117
and be grateful you're
still alive, okay?

47:41.119 --> 47:44.521
Get yourself cleaned up
and guard the bridge for me.

47:44.523 --> 47:45.789
Yes, sir.

47:45.791 --> 47:47.961
I'll be back shortly.
Dismissed.

48:05.543 --> 48:06.976
Clear the room.

48:06.979 --> 48:08.146
Yes, sir.

48:12.217 --> 48:13.986
Step out, gents.

48:23.263 --> 48:27.630
So, Commander Lynch tells me
that your mission down there

48:27.633 --> 48:30.333
was some top secret research.

48:30.335 --> 48:32.969
Top secret?

48:32.971 --> 48:35.338
No, Captain.
I am a scientist.

48:35.340 --> 48:37.574
We don't get to do secrets.

48:37.576 --> 48:40.110
So I've heard.

48:40.112 --> 48:41.978
But let me ask you this.

48:41.980 --> 48:44.847
Why would one of Russia's
top submarine officers decide

48:44.849 --> 48:47.351
to throw it all away
and become a scientist?

48:47.353 --> 48:52.856
Come on, Viktor, you had
to know that we know.

48:58.195 --> 49:00.496
You got me, Captain.

49:04.303 --> 49:05.501
You speak Russian?

49:05.503 --> 49:07.135
Now are you surprised?

49:07.137 --> 49:09.505
Now I'm gonna ask you
one last time

49:09.507 --> 49:11.842
because my patience
is running thin.

49:11.844 --> 49:13.110
What were you doing
down there?

49:13.112 --> 49:15.878
Were you trying to tap
into the SPCC?

49:15.880 --> 49:19.115
We were to study whales.

49:19.117 --> 49:20.782
If we find out that you
were trying to interfere

49:20.784 --> 49:22.318
with allied forces,

49:22.321 --> 49:25.320
there are going to be some
very serious consequences.

49:25.322 --> 49:27.222
Is that what you think?

49:27.224 --> 49:30.860
You think your president
is going to lift a finger?

49:30.862 --> 49:33.530
You overestimate
the intelligence

49:33.532 --> 49:35.331
of your current
Commander-in-Chief.

49:35.334 --> 49:38.200
Why are you Russians
always so arrogant?

49:38.202 --> 49:42.037
Why are you Americans
always are so piggish?

49:42.039 --> 49:46.876
You know, Captain Streeper,
in my country...

49:46.878 --> 49:48.912
We are not in your country!
We are on my ship!

49:48.914 --> 49:50.280
And that means,
if I give Jameson an order

49:50.282 --> 49:53.715
right now to shoot you,
he will not hesitate.

49:53.718 --> 49:56.186
So here's what I'm thinking.

49:56.188 --> 49:57.753
I'm thinking you were
trying to tap into

49:57.755 --> 49:59.621
the Southern Pacific
Communications Cable.

49:59.623 --> 50:01.557
And I'm thinking that, while
you were down there drilling,

50:01.559 --> 50:04.260
you have awakened a monster
from the bowels of hell.

50:04.262 --> 50:06.396
The problem is that
you got caught.

50:06.398 --> 50:08.798
This not only makes you a,
enemy of the United States.

50:08.800 --> 50:10.700
But an enemy against humanity.

50:10.702 --> 50:13.503
I don't think the Kremlin's
gonna be very happy with that.

50:13.505 --> 50:15.204
Some pretty bad publicity.

50:15.206 --> 50:20.744
So I'm gonna ask
you one last time.

50:20.746 --> 50:23.349
What were you
doing down there?

50:26.318 --> 50:28.654
I love whales.

50:39.630 --> 50:41.697
Stand up.

50:41.699 --> 50:43.101
Move.

50:46.070 --> 50:47.204
Viktor?

50:50.944 --> 50:52.675
Make sure the Captain
is comfortable.

50:52.678 --> 50:53.709
Yes, sir.

50:53.711 --> 50:55.314
Miss Popov, have a seat.

51:00.617 --> 51:02.318
Now I can't stress this enough,

51:02.321 --> 51:04.619
and I need you to be
honest with me.

51:04.621 --> 51:06.488
Commander Lynch has informed me
that you're willing

51:06.490 --> 51:08.425
to share information
that your commander

51:08.427 --> 51:11.193
was not willing to give up.

51:11.195 --> 51:13.662
I understand.

51:13.664 --> 51:17.967
What were you doing
down there?

51:17.970 --> 51:20.036
I can't tell you that,
Captain.

51:20.038 --> 51:23.872
Miss Popov, I have risked
the lives of my sailors

51:23.874 --> 51:25.208
to save your life.

51:25.210 --> 51:26.909
Not to mention facing
a horrific beast.

51:26.911 --> 51:29.881
The least you can do is
to be honest with me.

51:36.086 --> 51:41.023
If you are asking
why we were down there,

51:41.025 --> 51:43.194
you already know.

51:45.230 --> 51:48.296
The pipeline?

51:48.298 --> 51:50.733
Do you realize the amount
of international outcry

51:50.735 --> 51:52.168
this could cause toward
your country?

51:52.170 --> 51:54.871
That is not my call, Captain!

51:54.873 --> 51:58.541
I am soldier in
Russian military first

51:58.543 --> 52:00.242
even if my specialty is science.

52:00.244 --> 52:03.179
- That does not excuse...
- No, it doesn't!

52:03.181 --> 52:05.849
But what choice do I have?
Can I say no?

52:05.851 --> 52:08.550
Do you tell your president no?

52:08.552 --> 52:11.921
No, I guess not.

52:11.923 --> 52:13.856
What do you want
to know, Captain?

52:13.858 --> 52:17.025
I do not wish to die out here.

52:17.028 --> 52:20.832
What were you searching
for in the pipeline?

52:26.771 --> 52:29.938
The most dangerous thing
your enemy has,

52:29.940 --> 52:34.744
Captain, is their secrets.

52:34.746 --> 52:37.416
We're after secrets.

52:40.217 --> 52:43.353
Sir?
Can I have a moment?

52:43.355 --> 52:44.619
Sure thing.

52:44.621 --> 52:46.923
Excuse me.

52:46.925 --> 52:49.126
That shark is still out there.

52:49.128 --> 52:52.128
I do not wish
to die here, Captain.

52:52.130 --> 52:56.231
That shark is as dead
as your freedom.

52:56.233 --> 52:59.403
It's a long ride home.
Get comfortable.

53:16.554 --> 53:18.090
Right here's good!

53:25.195 --> 53:28.197
- Oh, yeah.
- Ah, man.

53:28.199 --> 53:31.034
That's the life
right there, man.

53:31.036 --> 53:33.105
- Cheers?
- Cheers.

54:20.051 --> 54:21.383
Cheng, this better
be important.

54:21.385 --> 54:23.220
We got a million things
going on right now.

54:23.222 --> 54:25.889
Sir, I think I have a solution
for if the Megalodon returns.

54:25.891 --> 54:27.490
What is that?
Some kind of detonator?

54:27.492 --> 54:28.891
Yes, sir.

54:28.893 --> 54:30.892
We already know that the shark
is attracted to the bell.

54:30.894 --> 54:33.329
So, theoretically, if we fill
it full of explosives,

54:33.332 --> 54:35.432
we can use it
to lure the shark

54:35.434 --> 54:37.367
and blow it up.

54:37.369 --> 54:39.334
Are you telling me that
you've taken a $2 billion dollar

54:39.337 --> 54:42.371
submersible prototype and you've
turned it into a cherry bomb?

54:42.373 --> 54:45.041
I used every spare
part I could find.

54:45.043 --> 54:47.142
I think I could probably
get a couple hundred feet

54:47.144 --> 54:48.677
of range on this thing.

54:48.679 --> 54:52.384
- Well, at least it's not 10.
- 10 would be bad.

54:55.786 --> 54:57.385
- Okay.
- Okay?

54:57.387 --> 55:01.523
If that's the best we got,
that's the best we got.

55:01.525 --> 55:03.892
A bad plan is still
a plan, Cheng!

55:03.894 --> 55:05.193
Yes, sir.

55:05.195 --> 55:06.498
I'll start rigging it up
with fuel now.

55:45.403 --> 55:46.538
Thanks.

55:50.842 --> 55:54.809
Anything?

55:54.811 --> 55:57.713
Damn it!

55:57.715 --> 55:59.584
Come on.

56:04.454 --> 56:06.057
Really?

56:45.195 --> 56:47.695
Captain on the bridge!

56:47.697 --> 56:48.865
At ease.

56:48.867 --> 56:50.365
Learn anything?

56:50.368 --> 56:52.501
Well, Ivanov didn't
want to talk.

56:52.503 --> 56:54.637
But Popov admitted to the SPCC.

56:54.640 --> 56:56.838
Said she was down there
for their enemy's secrets.

56:56.840 --> 56:58.941
Did they mention
anything about the sharks?

56:58.943 --> 57:01.344
Only that she didn't
wanna die down there.

57:01.346 --> 57:03.079
So they were
drilling the SPCC?

57:03.081 --> 57:04.780
- Yeah.
- Pentagon's gonna love that.

57:04.782 --> 57:07.583
Well, that's their problem.
How we looking on the ship?

57:07.585 --> 57:09.385
We're still dead
in the water, but...

57:09.387 --> 57:10.787
Yeah, but Munos is working
on it right now.

57:10.789 --> 57:15.624
- Sir?
- What is it?

57:15.626 --> 57:16.592
It's back!

57:16.594 --> 57:19.561
What do you mean, it's back?

57:19.563 --> 57:23.066
The shark is
circling the ship.

57:23.068 --> 57:24.233
Yeah, but it's moving
away there.

57:24.235 --> 57:25.771
Well, where is it going?

57:29.840 --> 57:31.340
Okay, Vallier, where
were we when we first

57:31.342 --> 57:33.244
picked up the signal?

57:35.547 --> 57:37.813
We picked up
the sub right about here.

57:37.815 --> 57:40.449
All right, so based on our
drift as well as start position,

57:40.451 --> 57:44.186
sea current, that would
put us right about here.

57:44.188 --> 57:46.054
- That's right about, sir.
- Okay.

57:46.057 --> 57:49.794
So the shark's going at a
45-degree angle northeast.

57:56.668 --> 57:57.669
No.

57:58.969 --> 58:00.135
I need you to get with Cheng

58:00.137 --> 58:02.637
and work on that
diving bell.

58:02.639 --> 58:03.671
Okay.

58:03.673 --> 58:05.441
I know you're
upset about this.

58:05.443 --> 58:07.208
But it seems to be the only
thing that's gonna work.

58:07.210 --> 58:08.244
You know that diving bell
inside and out

58:08.246 --> 58:11.747
and I really need your help.

58:11.749 --> 58:16.052
Yes, sir.

58:16.054 --> 58:17.385
Let's get down
to the engine room

58:17.387 --> 58:19.121
and make sure
that engine's running.

58:19.123 --> 58:20.358
Yes, sir.

58:30.768 --> 58:32.467
Good?
Ready to try it?

58:32.469 --> 58:35.871
Right here.
Ready?

58:36.873 --> 58:39.577
Damn it!
What is that?

58:49.987 --> 58:51.253
What is that sound?

58:51.255 --> 58:52.889
The sound from earlier.

58:52.891 --> 58:56.092
Yeah, but where's it
coming from?

58:56.094 --> 58:57.927
Just give me a second.

58:57.929 --> 59:02.634
I think it's coming
from the ship, sir.

59:10.106 --> 59:11.574
- Sir?
- What's up?

59:11.576 --> 59:12.974
- It's back.
- What's... what's back?

59:12.976 --> 59:14.610
- The shark's back.
- The shark is back?

59:14.612 --> 59:15.711
What are you talking about,
the shark is back?

59:15.713 --> 59:17.112
That means it hasn't left.

59:17.114 --> 59:18.514
I thought it left
the sonar there!

59:18.516 --> 59:19.715
You were just saying that
a few minutes ago!

59:19.717 --> 59:20.685
I know!

59:24.822 --> 59:26.054
Okay, get every branch

59:26.057 --> 59:27.456
of the military on
the phone right now immediately.

59:27.458 --> 59:30.427
- We are under attack!
- Copy that!

59:32.563 --> 59:34.530
Command, this is the USS Shaw.

59:34.532 --> 59:36.434
We need immediate assistance!

59:39.570 --> 59:41.970
Here we go, gents! Post up!

59:41.972 --> 59:44.139
Move, move! Right there,
right there, right there.

59:44.141 --> 59:45.941
Head on a swivel!

59:45.943 --> 59:47.543
Post up! Post up!

59:47.545 --> 59:50.412
Move! Post up.
Down! Go!

59:50.414 --> 59:51.847
Head on a swivel!

59:51.849 --> 59:55.717
Port side, 200 yards out!
There! Fire!

59:55.720 --> 59:57.188
Fire!

01:00:07.264 --> 01:00:10.335
Coming in! Coming in!

01:00:17.407 --> 01:00:19.974
Burkhead! Big gun!
Get on the big gun!

01:00:19.976 --> 01:00:21.579
Copy!

01:00:33.356 --> 01:00:35.326
Move! Move!

01:00:36.527 --> 01:00:38.862
Take that, you son of a bitch!

01:01:02.286 --> 01:01:03.887
Movement forward!

01:01:11.062 --> 01:01:12.864
Fire!

01:01:49.434 --> 01:01:51.200
- That's it?
- Yeah.

01:01:51.202 --> 01:01:52.337
All right.

01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:36.380
Cease fire!
Cease fire!

01:02:38.683 --> 01:02:39.951
Sir!

01:02:41.552 --> 01:02:42.954
This isn't working!

01:03:14.050 --> 01:03:15.784
Munos, shut it off!

01:03:15.786 --> 01:03:17.353
It's making the shark crazy.

01:03:17.356 --> 01:03:20.121
Yes, sir!

01:03:20.123 --> 01:03:21.492
Shut it down!

01:03:28.632 --> 01:03:31.233
Sir, the Russians
have escaped!

01:03:31.235 --> 01:03:32.836
Okay, go!

01:03:34.472 --> 01:03:36.708
Jameson, get to the brig!

01:03:42.545 --> 01:03:44.448
- Where is it?
- What?

01:03:52.390 --> 01:03:54.555
Hello, Commander.

01:03:54.557 --> 01:03:57.159
Nice to see you again.

01:03:57.161 --> 01:03:59.028
What did you do?

01:03:59.031 --> 01:04:00.098
Take a look.

01:04:06.237 --> 01:04:07.334
You idiot.

01:04:07.336 --> 01:04:10.206
So quick you judge.

01:04:10.208 --> 01:04:12.074
You say idiot, I say smart.

01:04:12.076 --> 01:04:14.510
There is no way
I'm letting you take us back

01:04:14.512 --> 01:04:17.012
to your country
to make example of.

01:04:17.014 --> 01:04:18.246
Yeah.

01:04:18.248 --> 01:04:19.782
Well, you just made sure
we're all gonna die.

01:04:19.784 --> 01:04:20.782
So thanks for that.

01:04:26.023 --> 01:04:27.456
You.

01:04:27.458 --> 01:04:29.858
Toss it overboard... now!

01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:31.461
No.

01:04:31.463 --> 01:04:34.963
Do it now or
we will kill you both.

01:04:34.965 --> 01:04:36.733
Do it.

01:04:47.878 --> 01:04:51.646
Good girl. It is a shame
we couldn't get

01:04:51.648 --> 01:04:53.481
to know each other better,
Commander.

01:04:53.483 --> 01:04:56.952
I have enjoyed this time we
spend down there together

01:04:56.954 --> 01:04:59.720
but now we must take the boat.

01:04:59.723 --> 01:05:02.759
And leave you all to fight
giant fish on your own.

01:05:14.006 --> 01:05:18.572
You're not going anywhere,
Red October.

01:05:18.574 --> 01:05:20.041
- Lieutenant?
- Yes, sir?

01:05:20.043 --> 01:05:21.510
If the Captain doesn't
put that weapon down

01:05:21.512 --> 01:05:24.380
by a count of one,
please shoot him.

01:05:24.382 --> 01:05:25.983
Yes, sir.

01:05:28.284 --> 01:05:29.987
Cover me, cover me!

01:05:46.305 --> 01:05:47.670
Secure the deck!

01:05:50.275 --> 01:05:52.608
Burkhead, secure the bridge!

01:05:52.610 --> 01:05:53.811
Yes, sir!

01:06:02.419 --> 01:06:04.887
Damn it!

01:06:04.889 --> 01:06:08.557
No, I understand, sir.
Thank you, sir.

01:06:08.559 --> 01:06:12.360
Well, that was the Pentagon.
They wanna stay hands-free.

01:06:12.362 --> 01:06:13.729
What?

01:06:13.731 --> 01:06:15.262
Do they know what
we're dealing with?

01:06:15.264 --> 01:06:16.798
They do. They're trying to
come up with solutions,

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:18.367
none of which we're gonna like.

01:06:18.369 --> 01:06:20.635
Sir, I have some news
you're not gonna like either.

01:06:20.637 --> 01:06:21.970
What is it?

01:06:21.972 --> 01:06:23.371
Ivanov is armed.
He released the bell

01:06:23.373 --> 01:06:25.374
and made Cheng throw
the detonator overboard.

01:06:25.376 --> 01:06:28.244
Jameson and his men
are pursuing him now.

01:06:28.246 --> 01:06:30.211
Anything else?

01:06:30.213 --> 01:06:33.581
About 90 seconds ago, the
shark swallowed the bell, sir.

01:06:33.583 --> 01:06:37.052
Is there any way we can
make it on the detonator?

01:06:37.054 --> 01:06:39.088
It is possible, theoretically.

01:06:39.090 --> 01:06:40.789
If I can find more parts,
I think...

01:06:40.791 --> 01:06:42.425
- You think?
- I'm sorry, sir.

01:06:42.427 --> 01:06:43.458
I mean, I will.

01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:44.726
- Good.
- I'm on it.

01:06:44.729 --> 01:06:46.196
Everyone's counting on you.

01:06:52.103 --> 01:06:53.369
Sir!

01:06:53.371 --> 01:06:55.570
With your permission, I need
to lock down the bridge!

01:06:55.572 --> 01:06:56.907
Permission granted.

01:07:29.373 --> 01:07:30.771
Where is he?

01:07:30.774 --> 01:07:32.943
- Who?
- Don't get smart...

01:08:35.173 --> 01:08:37.375
Jameson, give me a report.

01:08:39.209 --> 01:08:40.243
Jameson.

01:08:42.178 --> 01:08:44.113
Sir, Jameson's been shot!

01:08:44.115 --> 01:08:46.412
We think it's the Russians,
and they jumped ship.

01:08:46.415 --> 01:08:48.617
Burkhead, I need you
to get down there

01:08:48.618 --> 01:08:49.618
and figure out what happened.

01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:51.089
Yes, sir.

01:08:56.093 --> 01:08:57.926
What do we do, sir?

01:08:57.928 --> 01:08:59.694
Well, we're gonna
figure out from Cheng.

01:08:59.696 --> 01:09:02.962
- Sir?
- Will that thing work?

01:09:02.965 --> 01:09:05.868
I think... yes, sir,
definitely.

01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:07.703
- Only one problem.
- What is it?

01:09:07.705 --> 01:09:09.703
It's only gonna have
a short range on it.

01:09:09.706 --> 01:09:11.640
How short?

01:09:11.642 --> 01:09:13.341
20 feet, sir.

01:09:13.343 --> 01:09:15.042
20 feet?

01:09:15.045 --> 01:09:17.746
- Did you say 20 feet?
- Yeah.

01:09:17.747 --> 01:09:19.279
Well, at least it's not 10.

01:09:19.282 --> 01:09:20.849
No! I'm sorry.
That's not good enough!

01:09:20.850 --> 01:09:22.251
Hey, Commander...

01:09:22.252 --> 01:09:23.283
I'm not gonna let
anybody else go down...

01:09:23.286 --> 01:09:24.953
Commander!
Excuse me!

01:09:24.955 --> 01:09:26.555
Everybody leave us for
one minute, please.

01:09:26.557 --> 01:09:29.990
Thank you!

01:09:29.992 --> 01:09:31.359
- Commander...
- I'm sorry, sir.

01:09:31.361 --> 01:09:32.926
I just don't wanna
lose anyone else.

01:09:32.929 --> 01:09:34.296
This was supposed to be
a simple mission!

01:09:34.298 --> 01:09:38.064
Look at me.
Look at me!

01:09:38.068 --> 01:09:40.569
One day you're gonna make
a fantastic Captain.

01:09:40.571 --> 01:09:42.136
Thank you, sir, but...

01:09:42.138 --> 01:09:45.872
Unfortunately for you,
that day is today.

01:09:45.875 --> 01:09:47.274
No. No!

01:09:47.276 --> 01:09:48.776
I am ordering an
immediate evacuation,

01:09:48.778 --> 01:09:50.179
And I'm putting everybody
under your command.

01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:51.546
No!
This is a suicide mission!

01:09:51.549 --> 01:09:53.413
This shark is gonna
take down this ship!

01:09:53.416 --> 01:09:55.149
I need you get everyone
in the lifeboat.

01:09:55.151 --> 01:09:56.484
I'll deal with the shark.

01:09:56.486 --> 01:09:58.086
But I need somebody
to find the Admiral.

01:09:58.088 --> 01:10:00.088
- You don't have to do this.
- Yes, I do!

01:10:00.090 --> 01:10:01.356
The Captain goes down
with the ship!

01:10:01.359 --> 01:10:03.225
And one day, you'll
understand that!

01:10:03.227 --> 01:10:05.396
Now I'm giving you an order
and I expect you to execute it.

01:10:08.264 --> 01:10:12.200
Lynch, watching you grow
has been one of

01:10:12.202 --> 01:10:16.471
the greatest achievements
of my military career.

01:10:16.473 --> 01:10:18.841
Thank you, sir.

01:10:18.843 --> 01:10:20.443
Dismissed.

01:11:02.852 --> 01:11:07.890
All right, listen up because
I'm only gonna say this once.

01:11:07.892 --> 01:11:11.158
We've seen better days.

01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:14.096
We lost some brothers
and sisters today.

01:11:14.098 --> 01:11:16.798
But we also saved a few as well.

01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:21.069
We have found ourselves amid a
potential international crisis,

01:11:21.072 --> 01:11:23.404
not to mention facing a beast

01:11:23.406 --> 01:11:26.408
thought to be millions
of years extinct.

01:11:26.410 --> 01:11:28.542
Well, that thing wants
to take us out.

01:11:28.544 --> 01:11:31.445
But we will not let it,

01:11:31.448 --> 01:11:34.416
because we are
the United States Navy!

01:11:34.418 --> 01:11:38.252
We never quit!
And we will never surrender!

01:11:38.254 --> 01:11:42.591
Not today, not tomorrow,
not ever!

01:11:42.593 --> 01:11:45.060
We survive.

01:11:45.062 --> 01:11:51.198
Look, we've never seen anything
like this, not in these waters.

01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:54.302
I have ordered an
immediate evacuation

01:11:54.304 --> 01:11:57.271
and I have placed you under
the command of Commander Lynch

01:11:57.273 --> 01:11:58.573
who will make sure
that she sees

01:11:58.575 --> 01:12:01.275
each and every one
of you safely home.

01:12:01.277 --> 01:12:05.046
This thing wants
to take us down?

01:12:05.048 --> 01:12:08.249
Fine. Let it.

01:12:08.251 --> 01:12:11.386
Because we are going to
blow this thing apart

01:12:11.389 --> 01:12:14.390
because we are part
of the greatest military

01:12:14.392 --> 01:12:16.624
in the history of the world:

01:12:16.626 --> 01:12:19.594
The United States military!
Hooyah!

01:12:19.596 --> 01:12:21.762
Hooyah!

01:12:21.765 --> 01:12:25.065
It's been an honor serving
with each and every one of you.

01:12:25.067 --> 01:12:28.069
And each and every one of
you represents

01:12:28.071 --> 01:12:31.773
the Stars and Stripes,
the flag of freedom.

01:12:31.775 --> 01:12:35.310
And when times get tough, I want
each and every one of you

01:12:35.312 --> 01:12:38.313
to think about our
core principles,

01:12:38.315 --> 01:12:42.016
our core values:
Honor, courage and commitment!

01:12:42.018 --> 01:12:44.955
Because that is
the United States Navy way!

01:12:46.424 --> 01:12:50.091
Happy sailing, ladies
and gentlemen.

01:12:50.093 --> 01:12:51.495
Dismissed.

01:13:21.391 --> 01:13:25.225
Treadwell, get yourself
onto that lifeboat.

01:13:25.227 --> 01:13:28.896
Get off of this ship.

01:13:28.898 --> 01:13:30.633
Let me have that.

01:13:32.035 --> 01:13:34.202
Watch yourself, okay?

01:13:34.204 --> 01:13:36.273
- Yes, sir.
- Relieved.

01:13:53.790 --> 01:13:57.691
Everyone is ready, sir.

01:13:57.693 --> 01:13:59.795
Good.

01:13:59.797 --> 01:14:01.563
We've prepped
the engine room, sir.

01:14:01.565 --> 01:14:04.998
And I think
it's safe to say...

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.700
I know.

01:14:06.702 --> 01:14:08.569
Go.

01:14:08.571 --> 01:14:09.938
You get to that lifeboat,
sailor.

01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:12.541
That's an order.

01:14:12.543 --> 01:14:13.710
Yes, sir.

01:16:25.142 --> 01:16:26.943
Commander!

01:16:41.191 --> 01:16:43.661
Where are you going, Captain?

01:16:51.901 --> 01:16:53.435
Come on, Captain.

01:16:53.437 --> 01:16:55.406
Let's not draw this out.

01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:01.946
Ivanov, you know I have
to turn that engine on!

01:17:20.597 --> 01:17:23.364
Don't forget about
my mission, Captain.

01:17:23.366 --> 01:17:25.402
You have no mission, Ivanov!

01:17:40.383 --> 01:17:41.983
Hello, Commander.

01:17:41.985 --> 01:17:43.751
What did you do?

01:17:43.753 --> 01:17:45.153
Nothing.

01:20:16.004 --> 01:20:20.510
Come on out,
you son of a bitch!

01:21:13.763 --> 01:21:15.462
I gotta be honest, sir.

01:21:15.464 --> 01:21:17.765
That was some movie
hero type shit.

01:21:17.767 --> 01:21:19.766
You bet your ass it was!

01:21:19.768 --> 01:21:23.503
Streeper, you gotta
get off this boat.

01:21:23.505 --> 01:21:24.773
No, Admiral.

01:21:24.775 --> 01:21:26.039
The Captain goes down
with the ship.

01:21:26.041 --> 01:21:27.774
You know that.
You taught me that.

01:21:27.776 --> 01:21:30.845
Yeah, I did.
Now it's time to forget it.

01:21:30.847 --> 01:21:33.448
Actually, gentlemen,
this is my ship.

01:21:33.450 --> 01:21:35.149
Goddamn it, Lynch!
What are you doing down here?

01:21:35.151 --> 01:21:37.051
No time for that.
Let's get you two topside.

01:21:37.053 --> 01:21:38.685
No, no, no!
No chance of it!

01:21:38.687 --> 01:21:41.355
I'm done.
I'm finished.

01:21:41.357 --> 01:21:42.789
I ain't gonna make it.

01:21:42.791 --> 01:21:44.426
Lynch, get the Admiral
to the lifeboat right now!

01:21:44.428 --> 01:21:47.561
Get on a boat and get out.
Save yourselves, both of you.

01:21:47.563 --> 01:21:50.265
You gonna martyr
yourselves over me?

01:21:50.267 --> 01:21:51.666
There's sailors in
the water out there.

01:21:51.668 --> 01:21:53.333
They need you both.

01:21:53.335 --> 01:21:58.338
I'll take away my last chance to
have any glory in this lifetime.

01:21:58.340 --> 01:22:02.642
You're relieved of duty.
That's it.

01:22:02.644 --> 01:22:05.313
Actually, sir,
he gave command to me.

01:22:07.851 --> 01:22:11.685
Well then,
God speed to you both.

01:22:11.687 --> 01:22:13.654
- Get off the ship.
- Yes, sir.

01:22:13.656 --> 01:22:14.790
Leave me. Go.

01:22:21.130 --> 01:22:23.831
Sir, you're gonna need
to be within at least 20 feet

01:22:23.833 --> 01:22:25.867
in order to make
this thing work.

01:22:25.869 --> 01:22:28.069
You gotta free
the switch in order to activate

01:22:28.071 --> 01:22:32.073
the sounds so that the shark is
still interested in the ship.

01:22:32.075 --> 01:22:33.941
He's definitely interested.

01:22:33.943 --> 01:22:37.746
From the sound of it,
20 feet won't be a problem.

01:22:37.748 --> 01:22:40.181
Sir, if I may,

01:22:40.183 --> 01:22:44.017
everything
in my career, I owe to you.

01:22:44.019 --> 01:22:47.889
It has been an honor
serving under you, sir.

01:22:47.891 --> 01:22:51.324
You've been a good officer.

01:22:51.326 --> 01:22:53.528
Get the hell outta here.

01:22:53.530 --> 01:22:55.296
Thank you for everything.

01:22:55.298 --> 01:22:56.666
You're welcome.

01:24:12.375 --> 01:24:15.042
Well, hello, big fella.

01:24:15.045 --> 01:24:18.412
You know, my wife keeps telling
me to quit smoking.

01:24:18.415 --> 01:24:22.249
I guess now's
a good of time as any.

01:24:22.251 --> 01:24:24.254
What do you say?

01:24:35.165 --> 01:24:36.767
Adios.

01:25:16.906 --> 01:25:18.842
Thank you, Admiral.
