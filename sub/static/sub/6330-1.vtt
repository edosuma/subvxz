00:29.530 --> 00:33.700
[Man Narrating] Eighty-six
years of banging our heads
against the big green wall,

00:33.784 --> 00:35.535
but we finally did it.

00:35.619 --> 00:39.122
That part you know.
That part everybody knows.

00:39.289 --> 00:42.083
But I got a story
you don't know.

00:42.167 --> 00:45.878
It's about this schoolteacher
friend of mine named Ben.

00:45.963 --> 00:49.799
This is him, back in 1980,
when he was a kid.

00:49.883 --> 00:52.802
The little guy
was going through
a tough time.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.554
His parents
had just got divorced,

00:54.638 --> 00:56.597
and his mom
dragged him up here
to Boston

00:56.682 --> 00:58.599
where he didn't know nobody.

00:58.684 --> 01:02.103
One day Ben's mom says,
"Enough mopin' around,"

01:02.187 --> 01:05.063
and she calls her brother Carl
to take him somewhere,

01:05.149 --> 01:09.026
anywhere, just to get
the kid out of the house.

01:09.111 --> 01:11.571
Uncle Carl didn't have
any children of his own,

01:11.655 --> 01:15.158
so he wasn't exactly
what you'd call "kid savvy."

01:15.659 --> 01:18.161
I'm not gonna
have to change him
or anything, am I?

01:18.245 --> 01:22.123
Carl, look at him.
He's seven, you dope.
Come here.

01:22.207 --> 01:25.251
Carl wasn't the kind of uncle
who was gonna take you
to the circus

01:25.335 --> 01:27.754
or the zoo
or a puppet show,

01:27.838 --> 01:30.923
but he did know
the greatest place
to bring any kid,

01:31.008 --> 01:34.677
the heart and soul of Boston,
Fenway Park.

01:47.858 --> 01:50.359
That was also the day
I met Ben.

01:50.444 --> 01:51.986
The pretty boy
with the glasses?

01:52.070 --> 01:55.114
That's me, Al Waterman.
I sell sponges.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.450
Now that's
the Green Monster, kid.

01:57.534 --> 01:58.868
Monster?
Yep.

01:59.203 --> 02:01.412
[Narrating]
I taught the boy
what I knew about the game,

02:01.497 --> 02:03.164
and Carl taught him
what he knew.

02:03.373 --> 02:07.210
Hey, Zimmer, you idiot,
what are you batting
this bum leadoff for?

02:08.795 --> 02:12.673
[Narrator]
Dwight Evans parked
a couple homers, the Sox won,

02:12.758 --> 02:17.553
and by day's end, poor Ben
had become one of God's
most pathetic creatures,

02:17.763 --> 02:19.388
a Red Sox fan.
Wow!

02:20.140 --> 02:22.767
And that's where
the story begins.

02:23.560 --> 02:26.813
Careful, kid.
They'll break your heart.

02:28.440 --> 02:31.234
[Rock]

02:33.779 --> 02:37.532
[Man Speaking]
I'm gonna tell you a story

02:37.616 --> 02:39.742
I'm gonna tell you
about my town

02:40.202 --> 02:43.412
I'm gonna tell you
a big fat story, baby

02:44.081 --> 02:46.374
Aw, it's all about my town

02:48.335 --> 02:52.964
Yeah, down by the river

02:53.048 --> 02:56.342
Down by the banks
of the River Charles

02:56.426 --> 02:58.344
Aw, that's what's
happening, baby

02:58.428 --> 03:02.098
You could have gone over
right there. Come on,
you gotta be aggressive, man.

03:02.224 --> 03:05.059
Take off the training wheels.
Hey, I got a crowbar
under the seat, okay?

03:05.143 --> 03:07.061
So don't make me
knock your teeth out.

03:07.145 --> 03:08.896
What are you doing?
[Girls Chatting On Phones]

03:08.981 --> 03:11.357
Audrey and Tammy,
are you guys talking
to each other on the phone?

03:11.441 --> 03:13.651
[Audrey]
We're conferencing Amanda.
She's home sick.

03:13.902 --> 03:16.487
[Indistinct]
Amanda likes that song,
Mr. Wrightman.

03:16.572 --> 03:19.240
Can you turn it up, please?
[Louder]

03:19.658 --> 03:23.327
One, two, one, two
One, two, three, four

03:23.412 --> 03:26.706

Wasting pretty time always

03:26.790 --> 03:29.333
One, two, one, two
One, two, three, four

03:29.418 --> 03:31.294
Okay, so I asked for
no ham, double turkey,

03:31.378 --> 03:32.628
but it looks like
they gave me double ham.

03:32.671 --> 03:35.840
Do you want me to go back?
Uh, no. Just toss
some of it in my mouth.

03:35.966 --> 03:38.134
And that teacher's here
with those kids.
What?

03:38.218 --> 03:40.553
That teacher you talked to
on the phone, about coming in,
having a tour.

03:40.637 --> 03:42.555
Oh, oh, God,
that's today?

03:42.639 --> 03:45.099
They're here.
Oh, no.

03:45.183 --> 03:49.854
Okay, uh, just pretend
that you're me and take them
around and... Hi.

03:50.147 --> 03:52.940
There they are.
Ben Wrightman.
We talked on the phone.

03:53.066 --> 03:56.777
Nice to meet you.
Yes, yes,
I've been waiting for you.

03:57.279 --> 03:58.779
Hi, I'm Lindsey Meeks.

03:59.281 --> 04:01.157
Excuse me.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.159
Can I get anyone
something to drink?

04:03.243 --> 04:05.995
Vodka martini, straight up.
Three olives, please.

04:06.496 --> 04:07.997
Hey, I asked you
to behave.

04:08.332 --> 04:10.166
Uh, are you allowed
to hit them?

04:10.667 --> 04:12.919
Yeah, actually.
Do you wanna take
a swipe at him?

04:13.003 --> 04:14.962
I'll hold him
if you want.

04:15.631 --> 04:18.882
Maybe later.
Uh, okay. As I said
on the phone, Lindsey,

04:18.966 --> 04:21.218
I teach honors geometry,
ninth grade.

04:21.303 --> 04:23.846
And every year
I pick a few promising
math students

04:23.931 --> 04:26.807
to meet someone
who's pursued mathematics as
an educational discipline

04:26.892 --> 04:30.102
and has made practical use
of that education.

04:30.187 --> 04:32.396
So, thanks
for having us.

04:34.066 --> 04:35.399
All right, the client
I'm working for right now

04:35.484 --> 04:38.110
is this really cool company
called Marquis Jet,

04:38.195 --> 04:39.403
and they're trying
to figure out

04:39.488 --> 04:41.989
how to make
renting private jets
more affordable.

04:42.407 --> 04:45.159
Wow. Now that's
the way to go.

04:45.243 --> 04:47.244
Yeah, and they're growing
like crazy,

04:47.329 --> 04:49.497
so they'd have to
buy more jets in order
to meet the demands.

04:49.581 --> 04:51.749
Now let me ask you guys
a crazy question.

04:51.833 --> 04:54.126
Are any of you in the habit
of looking at numbers,

04:54.211 --> 04:57.838
you know, addresses,
license plates, phone numbers,
and adding them up

04:57.923 --> 05:01.550
and rearranging them
in your head to make
more interesting patterns?

05:02.052 --> 05:05.888
Oh, my God,
she knows my secret shame.

05:06.390 --> 05:10.685
Well, step into the light,
my friend, because this is
the church of numbers,

05:10.769 --> 05:12.770
and every day is Sunday.

05:15.023 --> 05:17.942
She was a major hottie.
Major?

05:18.068 --> 05:21.070
Colonel hottie.
Yeah, she went optic
for you, Mr. Wrightman.

05:21.154 --> 05:24.073
Optic?
Yeah, I saw her
glance to the pants.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.491
No way.
Yeah.

05:25.575 --> 05:26.701
What do you mean?

05:27.035 --> 05:30.371
I mean she was totally...
No, no, not you.
You. What did you mean?

05:30.998 --> 05:33.541
Nothin', you know.

05:34.001 --> 05:36.252
Well, come on, man.
You saw her.

05:36.336 --> 05:40.715
What? Wait.
Are you saying that
she's out of my league?

05:41.008 --> 05:43.175
She is bringing
some serious heat, man.

05:43.260 --> 05:44.635
I don't know
if you got the bat speed.

05:44.720 --> 05:49.557
Oh, I got the bat speed.
I got plenty of bat speed.
I could hit her best cheese.

05:49.891 --> 05:53.477
Ezra, I need those
customer satisfaction
data reports.

05:53.603 --> 05:56.647
I put them on your desk,
Lindsey.
Good lad. Keep me posted.

05:56.732 --> 05:58.315
You got it.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.777
Those kids were cute.
Which kids?

06:01.903 --> 06:05.031
The ones
from earlier today.
Oh. Yeah.

06:05.115 --> 06:08.534
Maybe I should become
a teacher or
a college professor, you know.

06:08.618 --> 06:12.371
The hours would be better.
You get summers free.
It's so much less competitive.

06:12.456 --> 06:15.499
Oh, my God,
Jack is leaving.
What?

06:15.584 --> 06:17.251
Jack is leaving
the company next summer.

06:17.335 --> 06:19.879
[Gasps,
Mouthing Words]

06:20.172 --> 06:23.632
What that... So, do you think
they're gonna bring someone
in from the outside?

06:23.759 --> 06:27.470
I have... I don't know.
Or do you think they're
gonna promote from within?

06:27.554 --> 06:29.472
I thought you were
becoming a teacher.

06:29.556 --> 06:33.517
[Scoffs]
Low blood sugar.
I didn't eat yet.

06:33.977 --> 06:35.144
Hi.

06:35.479 --> 06:37.480
Hi.
I didn't wanna interrupt.

06:37.564 --> 06:41.067
It sounded like
you were involved with
some major corporate hoo-ha.

06:41.151 --> 06:43.694
Oh, well,
there's a position
about to open up,

06:43.779 --> 06:46.489
so it might get
mildly murderous
around here.

06:46.573 --> 06:49.408
Oh. Wha... wha... wha...
I want your job!
I'm the boss!

06:49.493 --> 06:51.160
Wha... Wha...
[Chuckles]

06:51.828 --> 06:55.206
Yes. So, um...

06:56.833 --> 06:59.668
Why am I here? Um...
[Clears Throat]

07:00.504 --> 07:03.839
I just wanted you to know
that you really got through
to the kids today.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.841
You know,
they're really juiced.

07:05.926 --> 07:09.053
[Cell Phone Ringing]
Oh, thanks. They were...
They were great.

07:09.137 --> 07:12.223
Well, you're welcome.
Thank you.

07:15.769 --> 07:19.939
So, is the
conversation over?

07:20.023 --> 07:21.774
You mean
'cause neither of us
are speaking?

07:21.858 --> 07:24.026
[Chuckles]
Yeah.

07:24.277 --> 07:27.238
No. Yeah, I also...
I came back because
I just...

07:27.531 --> 07:31.325
I wanted to ask you if I could
ask you out sometime.

07:31.868 --> 07:33.869
Socially.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.872
I won't be bringing
the kids.

07:37.207 --> 07:39.124
Oh!

07:40.794 --> 07:42.878
Uh...

07:42.963 --> 07:44.880
Hike.
[Man]
Get him! Get him!

07:48.426 --> 07:51.554
[Man] oh!
All right,
good "D." Good "D."

07:54.599 --> 07:57.560
I know why she wouldn't
go out with me. She thinks
I'm not in her class.

07:57.686 --> 08:01.397
She said that?
No. I could see it
on her face.

08:01.523 --> 08:03.983
"Like I would really
date a schoolteacher."
Ouch.

08:04.067 --> 08:07.194
Down, set, hike.

08:12.242 --> 08:14.702
[Man]
Yeah, go, go, go!

08:17.247 --> 08:21.000
Ben, what are you doing?
It's two-hand touch.
You were down back there.

08:21.084 --> 08:23.168
And back there
and back there.

08:23.253 --> 08:26.005
What's the matter
with you?

08:26.089 --> 08:28.007
Come on, guys.

08:28.091 --> 08:31.176
Sorry. Sorry, guys.

08:32.971 --> 08:34.804
[Syncopated Beat]

08:34.890 --> 08:37.265
All right, Lindsey,
so what's the matter
with this one?

08:37.350 --> 08:40.019
He's not smart?
He's not attractive?

08:40.102 --> 08:43.188
He was.
It's just, you know...

08:43.273 --> 08:48.110
I don't know.
It's hopeless.
Oh, boy, here we go.

08:48.194 --> 08:51.697
You're right, I'm an idiot.
I'm about to turn 20-10,

08:51.781 --> 08:54.867
and the dating market
is, shall we say, bearish.

08:54.951 --> 08:59.538
And instead of becoming
more open and available,
I'm becoming less open.

08:59.664 --> 09:02.583
Come on, people.
Talking isn't
burning calories.

09:02.709 --> 09:05.127
Let's go.
Start pedaling.
Come on.

09:15.305 --> 09:17.640
Maybe you should date
a different kind of guy.

09:17.724 --> 09:19.141
Why?
What do you mean?

09:19.225 --> 09:24.104
Well, all the guys you date
are sharp and competitive
and successful.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.690
It's like
you're dating yourself.
Ding, ding, ding.

09:27.984 --> 09:30.444
Wh... What's wrong
with the schoolteacher?

09:30.528 --> 09:33.948
Well...
He's a schoolteacher.

09:34.157 --> 09:37.660
Which means he has
a small... Income.

09:37.953 --> 09:42.206
All right, people,
let's shut your piehole
and speed it back up. Come on!

09:43.124 --> 09:46.710
Come on!
Die, you Nazi spin-bitch.

09:53.593 --> 09:57.012
[Whistling]
Hey! Go, run a post. Go!

09:58.556 --> 10:00.182
Oh!
[Chuckles]

10:01.184 --> 10:02.351
Who did that?

10:03.353 --> 10:05.521
That's it.
You're coming with me, Mister.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.690
What do you think,
this is your own
private playground?

10:07.941 --> 10:09.858
Get in here.

10:15.031 --> 10:17.241
Thanks, man.
I owe you one.

10:19.619 --> 10:20.953
Go ahead.

10:22.914 --> 10:25.499
[Whistling]

10:25.583 --> 10:28.460
Hey, Ben, are you going
to watch the Celtics later?

10:28.545 --> 10:30.629
Uh, I don't know.

10:30.714 --> 10:33.924
You know,
there are other sports
besides baseball.

10:34.009 --> 10:35.384
I would debate you, Ed,

10:35.468 --> 10:37.761
but that would only lead to
me being dragged away
in handcuffs.

10:37.846 --> 10:41.473
Hey, speaking of baseball,
Ben, wanna help me coach
the J.V. Team this year?

10:41.558 --> 10:45.394
Why? You're doing a great job.
I mean, you can't just go
by wins and losses.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.438
Aw, come on, Ben.
The kids listen to you.

10:47.814 --> 10:50.149
I think it's going good
the way it is, you know?

10:50.233 --> 10:52.151
You coach the team,
and I help out whenever I can.

10:52.235 --> 10:55.237
Then, if I don't
make it or...

10:56.072 --> 10:58.699
Hey, Rita,
when did I get this message
from Lindsey Meeks?

10:58.783 --> 11:03.412
A tip might be
where it says
"Time called: 2:30."

11:03.788 --> 11:05.748
[Whistles]

11:05.832 --> 11:08.000
Come on, pull!

11:09.044 --> 11:11.712
So, do you think it'll be
a problem that you're more
successful than him?

11:11.838 --> 11:15.591
Who says I am?
Well, I mean,
at least financially.

11:15.675 --> 11:19.136
It's not like he's playing
a flute with a hatful of
dollar bills in front of him.

11:19.220 --> 11:22.473
He's a teacher.
Teaching's
a cool thing.

11:22.599 --> 11:25.726
Yeah. Besides, why does
everything in my life
have to be a trophy?

11:25.852 --> 11:28.854
I mean, who am I
trying to impress?
Hey, we're on your side.

11:28.938 --> 11:31.815
No, I know.
It's just that I hate
when people... [Gasps]

11:31.900 --> 11:35.027
Ow!

[Lindsey Groaning]

11:49.834 --> 11:54.463
Oh, just kill me.
Just take a hammer
and kill me.

11:55.131 --> 11:57.132
[Groaning Continues]

12:01.012 --> 12:05.724
[Doorbell Rings]
Oh, shit.
Who is it?

12:06.017 --> 12:08.310
I... It's me. It's Ben.
Your date?

12:08.394 --> 12:10.729
Oh, God, no.

12:11.272 --> 12:13.315
Oh.
[Door Lock Clicks]

12:15.985 --> 12:19.947
I'm sick. Come back.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Go away.

12:20.031 --> 12:22.366
Wait, wait, wait.
What kind of sick?
You okay? You in pain?

12:22.450 --> 12:27.037
I... [Swallows]
Ate at this new place.

12:27.122 --> 12:29.248
I think...

12:31.334 --> 12:32.584
[Vomiting]

12:35.839 --> 12:38.215
Are you faking it?
'Cause we don't have to
really do this if you don't...

12:38.299 --> 12:41.176
[Vomiting Continues]

12:46.891 --> 12:48.851
Mommy.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.314
Ernie, go away.

12:54.399 --> 12:56.859
Ernie, don't eat that!

12:56.943 --> 12:58.610
Oh, shit.

12:59.696 --> 13:01.488
Uh...

13:03.616 --> 13:05.450
So, you wanna pull the plug
on this thing or...

13:05.535 --> 13:09.955
[Vomiting, Choking,
Coughing]

13:12.917 --> 13:16.420
All right, here we go.
Come on.

13:16.504 --> 13:18.672
All right,
we're almost there.

13:18.756 --> 13:21.592
Okay. Okay.

13:21.676 --> 13:24.303
Now sit right here.
Oh, God!

13:24.387 --> 13:27.222
All right. Okay.
Here. Pick your head up.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.641
[Groans]
Up. Okay, up.

13:29.726 --> 13:31.226
[Groans]

13:31.853 --> 13:34.188
Uh, all right. Um...

13:34.272 --> 13:37.191
Do you have any, like,
pajamas or a nightgown?

13:38.067 --> 13:39.776
In the top drawer.

13:40.028 --> 13:42.529
Top drawer. Okay.

13:42.614 --> 13:45.240
All right, here we go.

13:45.325 --> 13:48.702
[Chuckles]
Well, Wonder Woman's
been looking for these.

13:48.786 --> 13:50.746
I gotta call her.
Let her know they're here.

13:53.458 --> 13:58.003
Okay. All right.
I'll help you up.
Mm-mm.

13:58.087 --> 14:00.881
Get up.
[Groans]
I'm sorry about this.

14:01.257 --> 14:04.259
Don't worry.
Come on. Come on.
I'm so sorry.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.845
I'm gonna help you change,
all right? I won't look.
I promise.

14:06.930 --> 14:09.097
Uh-huh.
Okay.

14:14.062 --> 14:17.064
Okay, I looked.
[Chuckles]

14:19.400 --> 14:21.443
Let's get this on.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.948
Get your arms through.

14:33.289 --> 14:37.334
Okay, here we go.
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

14:37.418 --> 14:39.586
There's nothing left
to throw up, I promise.

14:39.671 --> 14:44.591
And if you do,
here's Mr. Hamper.
Okay? All right.

14:44.676 --> 14:46.635
Sooner or later

14:46.719 --> 14:51.223
I'm gonna
get through to you

14:51.307 --> 14:53.433
[Sighs]

14:55.186 --> 14:57.271
I'm tellin' you, baby

14:57.355 --> 14:59.982
Here. Drink this
when you feel like
you can, okay?

15:00.108 --> 15:02.442
Thank you.
Thank you, Bill.
All right.

15:02.527 --> 15:04.987
It's Ben.
Okay, go back to sleep.

15:05.071 --> 15:08.240
I've got time on my side

15:08.408 --> 15:11.535
Along for the ride

15:11.828 --> 15:16.707
And everything was certain
like the sunbeam

15:17.166 --> 15:22.879
And this moment
has just begun

15:23.214 --> 15:27.009
Ooh

15:29.012 --> 15:31.722
Sooner or later

15:32.432 --> 15:37.352
Gonna soothe you
turn you on

Sooner or later

15:43.985 --> 15:45.944
[Fades]

15:47.655 --> 15:49.364
[Snoring]

16:02.337 --> 16:04.713
Hey.
Hi.

16:05.048 --> 16:06.548
How you feeling?

16:06.841 --> 16:11.470
Uh, I mean,
I'm not about to enter
any pie-eating contests.

16:14.390 --> 16:17.684
Did you clean up my bathroom,
or did I dream that?

16:17.977 --> 16:23.565
Me? No.
Uh, the vomit elves came in.
And, uh, really adorable.

16:23.858 --> 16:27.986
Really cute little things.
I mean, little caps
and little barf bags.

16:29.739 --> 16:31.823
Well, thank you.

16:32.533 --> 16:35.369
I mean, you really,
really went above and beyond.

16:35.453 --> 16:38.663
Uh, no, please.
It wasn't a big deal.
You were very ladylike.

16:38.748 --> 16:40.707
Hardly any "chunkage."

16:46.089 --> 16:48.965
What's in the bag?
I got some, uh...

16:49.050 --> 16:51.593
I got some movies
just in case you woke up.
Not in case you woke up.

16:51.677 --> 16:53.095
I knew you were
going to wake up.

16:53.179 --> 16:56.264
In case you woke up
in the middle of the night.

16:56.474 --> 16:58.892
Yeah?
Anything good?

16:58.976 --> 17:01.186
Uh, mostly animated
pornography from Japan.

17:01.270 --> 17:04.606
And a little something
I like to watch too
when I feel sick.

17:05.233 --> 17:06.942
Well, for me,
it's Annie Hall.

17:07.109 --> 17:09.944
Wh... What did you say?
Annie Hall.

17:10.570 --> 17:13.990
Whoa, this is like...
This is unbelievable.

17:14.784 --> 17:15.992
Road House.

17:16.077 --> 17:17.993
[Chuckles]

17:19.454 --> 17:22.624
Are you feeling...
Is this crazy?
I mean, what are the odds?

17:22.834 --> 17:24.626
Spooky.

17:28.089 --> 17:31.174
No, she cannot
have my assistant.

17:31.259 --> 17:33.718
Because I trained Carrie.
I like her.

17:33.803 --> 17:37.973
Listen. Do we have to
settle this right now?
I'm with a... Person.

17:39.559 --> 17:43.061
Yes. Thank you.
Okay, I'll speak to you
tomorrow. Bye-bye.

17:43.146 --> 17:45.772
[Phone Beeps]
I'm really, really sorry.

17:45.857 --> 17:47.566
Actually, I'm sorry.
I ate everything cool.

17:47.650 --> 17:49.651
I just left you
a pile of sauce.

17:50.069 --> 17:53.488
That's okay.
Actually, I'm the worst.
I eat off everybody's plate.

17:53.573 --> 17:56.825
In fact, my friends,
they call me "the seagull."
[Imitates Seagull Cawing]

17:57.452 --> 17:59.244
Oh, hi, seagull.

17:59.328 --> 18:01.413
[Both Chuckle]

18:01.497 --> 18:03.206
Nice.

18:04.083 --> 18:07.085
No, really,
I appreciate you being cool
about the phone thing,

18:07.170 --> 18:10.422
because I once went on a date
with this guy who got so angry
I was on the phone

18:10.506 --> 18:13.216
that he grabbed it out of
my hand, and he threw it
in the fish tank.

18:14.135 --> 18:15.844
I would never do that.

18:16.387 --> 18:19.055
What are your pet peeves?
What stresses you out?

18:20.516 --> 18:21.725
Mm, I got...
And I'm only asking

18:21.809 --> 18:25.145
because frankly
the men I meet are highly...

18:25.396 --> 18:27.189
I date poodles basically.

18:27.732 --> 18:30.192
And I'm really relaxed,
you know? Totally.

18:30.359 --> 18:31.693
[Cell Phone Ringing]
Son of a... Stop ringing.

18:31.777 --> 18:32.944
I got it.

18:33.029 --> 18:34.988
Let me do it.
Let me do it.

18:35.156 --> 18:39.367
Hello?
Uh, no, she isn't.
May I take a message?

18:39.577 --> 18:42.871
This is Ben.
I'm her houseboy/sex slave.

18:43.206 --> 18:46.333
Okay. You betcha.
Bye-bye.

18:47.168 --> 18:48.877
Call your mother.

18:51.589 --> 18:54.090
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
So you don't have
a cell phone,

18:54.175 --> 18:57.010
a Blackberry,
a pager, nothing?
No.

18:57.094 --> 18:59.471
Well, what if some
sudden crisis occurs,

18:59.555 --> 19:01.681
like your father
has a heart attack
or something?

19:01.807 --> 19:04.726
My father died
two years ago.
Oh, I'm sorry.

19:04.810 --> 19:07.479
I just found out this morning,
so it's been a rough 24 hours.

19:07.563 --> 19:09.648
You know, maybe I should
get a cell phone.
That's a good idea.

19:09.732 --> 19:12.651
You're funny, Ben...
Wrightman.

19:12.735 --> 19:14.653
Wrightman. Yeah.
Yeah.

19:14.737 --> 19:16.488
You forgot my last name.
No, I just blanked.

19:16.572 --> 19:20.075
I know why you forgot.
That's all right. I bet
when you talk to your friends,

19:20.159 --> 19:22.869
you call me
Ben the schoolteacher,
am I right?

19:25.122 --> 19:26.665
Well?
That's okay.

19:26.749 --> 19:29.751
What do you call me
to your friends?

19:29.835 --> 19:33.588
I call you Lindsey,

19:35.132 --> 19:37.801
the vomit girl,
the puker, pukey.

19:37.885 --> 19:40.178
Everyone says, "You going
out with pukey tonight?"
I'm like, "Yeah. Why?"

19:40.263 --> 19:43.848
"You wanna play video games
or something?"I'm like,"No,
I'm going out with pukey."

19:43.933 --> 19:46.184
That's horrible.

19:46.269 --> 19:51.398
Hey, anything I've said
about you would be
an understatement, really.

20:05.079 --> 20:07.789
Hey, Lindsey!
Hi!

20:07.873 --> 20:11.293
Hi.
Hi, I'm Ben
the schoolteacher.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.295
Ian. Sarah.

20:13.379 --> 20:15.297
Steve. Molly.
Oh, thanks
for having me.

20:15.381 --> 20:18.133
Robin and Chris.
Welcome aboard.

20:18.801 --> 20:20.927
Well, let's start
the interrogation.

20:21.012 --> 20:22.929
No, no,
it's not like that.

20:23.014 --> 20:25.599
Here.
It's for the urine sample.

20:25.683 --> 20:29.394
Shoot, I wish you would have
told me. I just took a whiz
in your bushes.

20:29.478 --> 20:31.605
[All Laughing]
Do you want to...

20:31.689 --> 20:33.648
Show him the house.

20:34.150 --> 20:37.027
I like it when it rains

20:38.362 --> 20:41.364
It's always
on the windowpane

20:41.449 --> 20:45.744
Lindsey, this Ben guy
has got such a good vibe.
Good.

20:45.828 --> 20:48.371
And he's nothing like
the guys you usually date.
I know.

20:48.456 --> 20:49.789
[Sarah] and how cute is he?

20:49.874 --> 20:52.042
Yeah? Well, I'm really glad
you guys feel this way,

20:52.126 --> 20:55.462
because if you didn't,
I was gonna have to find
three new friends.

20:55.588 --> 20:58.590
No, no, no, I really think
you've got something here.
Me too.

20:58.674 --> 21:02.677
Yeah, but... Something's
not quite right.

21:02.928 --> 21:05.138
Robin.
No, no, he's great.

21:05.222 --> 21:07.682
He is. I love him.
He's a doll.

21:08.142 --> 21:10.310
But he's not 22.
So?

21:10.394 --> 21:14.314
So, where's he been?
Why is he still
on the market?

21:14.982 --> 21:17.984
Um...
Maybe he hasn't found
the right person yet.

21:18.069 --> 21:20.487
Well, by now he should be
with the wrong person.

21:20.571 --> 21:23.531
How has he not been
tranquilized and tagged?

21:24.742 --> 21:26.785
Let me get this straight.

21:26.869 --> 21:29.329
You got two season tickets
behind the Red Sox dugout?

21:29.455 --> 21:32.248
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
My uncle left them to me.
Behind the dugout?

21:32.333 --> 21:34.918
Yeah. Well, not really behind,
like next to it.
Fifteen feet away.

21:35.002 --> 21:38.963
You can see right into it
at a certain point.
It's pretty awesome.

21:41.634 --> 21:44.761
Let me ask you this.

21:44.845 --> 21:46.971
Do you find my wife
attractive at all?

21:47.056 --> 21:49.474
'Cause we could work
something out.

21:53.396 --> 21:55.605
Well, do you?

21:56.399 --> 21:57.482
You know what
you need to do?

21:57.566 --> 21:59.401
You need to
go to his apartment and
go through his things.

21:59.485 --> 22:00.985
You need to go through
his closets, sofa cushions.

22:01.070 --> 22:02.070
You need to
get on his computer.

22:02.738 --> 22:05.407
And what exactly
am I looking for?

22:05.491 --> 22:07.409
Anything that explains
why he's still single.

22:07.743 --> 22:09.703
My company can run
a credit check on him.

22:09.787 --> 22:12.038
You know, he could be
a deadbeat dad.

22:12.331 --> 22:15.041
This is
an insane asylum.

22:15.251 --> 22:20.296
So, uh, when they
wheeled out Ted Williams
at the All-Star Game...

22:20.673 --> 22:24.592
I was there.
I was 10 feet
away from him.

22:24.677 --> 22:28.763
Old men crying.
Tears.

22:30.391 --> 22:32.559
Tough old guys.

22:32.643 --> 22:35.770
I even started
to lose it, you know.

22:36.021 --> 22:38.440
I got a program.
I could show you.

22:39.567 --> 22:43.153
If Lindsey ever breaks up
with you, I'll kill her.

22:43.237 --> 22:45.447
Lindsey, do you remember
that guy Maureen Durst
went out with?

22:46.615 --> 22:49.659
Uh, sort of. Why?
[Molly]
Terry what's-his-name?

22:50.953 --> 22:52.454
We all thought
he was great too.

22:52.580 --> 22:54.748
Well, what happened?
Oh, my God. She went
to his apartment and...

22:54.832 --> 22:57.041
Shh. My story.
Stand by.

22:57.626 --> 23:00.044
She's at his place.
He's in the shower.

23:00.129 --> 23:04.007
She wants to make the bed,
so she goes to the closet.
Guess what she finds.

23:04.091 --> 23:06.134
Oh, I don't know.
What'd she find?

23:06.469 --> 23:10.430
Two large plastic bags
containing all of the hair
and nail clippings

23:10.514 --> 23:12.390
from his entire life.

23:12.683 --> 23:14.601
Eww!

23:14.685 --> 23:16.978
Eww!
That's a true story.

23:17.062 --> 23:19.814
I'm telling you,
there is a reason
this Ben guy is still single.

23:25.821 --> 23:27.781
Come on, baby

23:27.865 --> 23:30.408
[Alarm Clock Ringing]

24:45.901 --> 24:48.444
[No Audible Dialogue]

25:17.558 --> 25:19.851
Come on!
I promised him we'd wait.

25:19.935 --> 25:23.605
We're always
waiting for him.
I gave him my word.

25:24.773 --> 25:25.899
You guys wait?

25:25.983 --> 25:27.901
Yeah.
Come on, man.

25:27.985 --> 25:29.903
Did anyone die
because you're here?
No, no, no.

25:29.987 --> 25:32.238
I got
another anesthesiologist
to cover for me.

25:32.323 --> 25:34.240
[Ben]
All right, are you ready?

25:34.325 --> 25:37.035
Hey, come on!
God.

25:46.629 --> 25:49.213
[Sniffs]

25:53.385 --> 25:54.636
A new season.

25:54.970 --> 25:58.848
A clean slate.

25:58.933 --> 26:01.809
Yep, this smells
like the year.

[Imitates Seagull Cawing]

26:08.734 --> 26:11.110
Hey, you wanna
know something?
What?

26:11.195 --> 26:15.073
I like you.
I like you.

26:15.157 --> 26:16.658
No, I mean,
I really like you.

26:16.742 --> 26:19.661
I even wrote down
a list of all the things
I like about you.

26:20.955 --> 26:22.205
You made a list?

26:22.289 --> 26:25.833
Yeah. I don't have it with me,
but I can remember it.

26:26.210 --> 26:29.420
I'll skip down
because the first six
are all body parts.

26:29.672 --> 26:34.008
Uh, number seven:
I like that you drink
in the afternoon.

26:35.177 --> 26:38.763
Number eight: I like sometimes
you talk out of the side
of your mouth a little bit.

26:38.847 --> 26:41.516
And it's like...
It's like an adorable
stroke victim.

26:42.685 --> 26:43.977
I do?

26:44.061 --> 26:47.188
No, it's very cute.
It really is.
Uh, number nine.

26:47.606 --> 26:50.608
You know, when you're getting
ready in the mirror, just when
you're about finished,

26:50.693 --> 26:52.402
you go like...

26:52.486 --> 26:56.364
It's so cute,
I wanna kill myself.
It's fantastic. Uh...

26:56.448 --> 26:59.117
Hey, when's your break?
Hmm?

26:59.243 --> 27:02.537
For your school vacation.
When do you get off?
End of March.

27:02.871 --> 27:05.039
That's when
you're in Baltimore, right?
Yeah.

27:05.124 --> 27:06.791
Well, it's a really big deal
in my family,

27:06.875 --> 27:10.211
because it's
my dad's birthday
and Easter,

27:10.295 --> 27:12.964
and my sister's anniversary
all in the same week.

27:13.048 --> 27:15.466
A cluster.
Yeah. Uh...

27:15.551 --> 27:19.220
So, uh, how would
you like to come?

27:22.224 --> 27:24.058
Ooh, too fast?
Too serious?

27:24.143 --> 27:26.394
No, why?
Did I look like
I was just...

27:26.895 --> 27:28.688
You were a little.
No, 'cause...

27:28.772 --> 27:31.315
No, I... I made...
I have a previous commitment.

27:31.400 --> 27:34.944
Oh, plans?
Yeah, yeah.

27:35.029 --> 27:37.572
Um, see, I didn't tell you
about it, 'cause I knew
you were gonna be away.

27:37.656 --> 27:42.326
I figured it wouldn't matter,
but every year
during Easter vacation,

27:42.411 --> 27:47.248
uh, me and my friends,
we go down to Florida.

27:47.916 --> 27:52.837
You and your buddies
go down to Florida for
spring break? At your age?

27:52.921 --> 27:55.798
No, no, no, not spring break.
Spring training
with the Red Sox.

27:55.883 --> 27:58.217
Oh, you get to train
with the Red Sox?

27:58.635 --> 28:00.303
Are you allowed
to do that?

28:00.387 --> 28:03.514
Well, we don't actually...
We watch the games.

28:03.599 --> 28:05.516
Aren't those
just practice games?

28:05.601 --> 28:08.019
Yeah, yeah, but there's
more to it than that.

28:08.103 --> 28:11.522
We scout the players.
We... We say which players
they should keep,

28:11.607 --> 28:12.648
which they should
get rid of.

28:12.733 --> 28:14.609
And the Red Sox
ask your opinion?

28:15.652 --> 28:17.570
Well, not yet.

28:17.654 --> 28:20.907
But if they ever do, uh...

28:20.991 --> 28:23.659
Okay, I've been
avoiding this.

28:26.663 --> 28:29.457
There's something
you don't know about me.

28:30.125 --> 28:31.793
Oh, God, here comes
the bag of hair.

28:34.505 --> 28:39.425
The thing is, uh,
I am a Red Sox fan.

28:40.469 --> 28:45.431
Yeah?
No, I'm like a big,
big Red Sox fan.

28:46.266 --> 28:48.392
I know.
I mean, I've been
to your apartment

28:48.477 --> 28:53.981
and seen the Red Sox
dish towels and glasses
and the Yankee toilet paper.

28:54.066 --> 28:57.443
It's like you live
in a gift shop.
It's worse.

29:00.280 --> 29:02.323
See, when I was a kid,
I moved here from New Jersey,

29:02.407 --> 29:04.408
and I didn't have
any friends or anything,

29:04.493 --> 29:06.661
so my uncle Carl started
taking me to Fenway Park.

29:08.872 --> 29:11.833
I just...
I got lost in the game.

29:11.917 --> 29:14.335
I mean, the ballpark
and the people.

29:14.837 --> 29:16.671
The color, the sounds.

29:16.755 --> 29:18.256
The smells.

29:21.009 --> 29:22.927
And then he got cancer
and he died.

29:23.011 --> 29:25.847
He left me
his season tickets.

29:26.014 --> 29:27.849
And it's a passion.

29:27.933 --> 29:31.894
I mean, it's a very,
very big part of my life.

29:33.021 --> 29:37.024
And it's been a problem
with me and women.

29:37.109 --> 29:39.569
Oh, ah,
I know those women.

29:39.653 --> 29:43.531
The "pay attention to me"
and "why aren't you
talking to me?"

29:44.283 --> 29:47.827
Yeah. Exactly.
God, those women
are so pathetic.

29:47.911 --> 29:50.830
Yeah, it's like,
"What are you getting
so worked up for?

29:50.914 --> 29:53.499
I mean, you're not even
doing it, you're watching it."
Yeah.

29:53.584 --> 29:56.460
It's like,
"Hey, how about sometimes
I like to be 11 years old."

29:56.545 --> 29:57.587
Yeah.

29:57.671 --> 30:00.965
I like being part of something
that's bigger than me,
than I.

30:01.049 --> 30:04.093
It's good for your soul
to invest in something
that you can't control.

30:04.678 --> 30:06.929
You're a romantic.

30:08.182 --> 30:09.223
Hmm?

30:09.308 --> 30:14.103
You have a lyrical soul.
You can love under the best
and worst conditions.

30:14.188 --> 30:17.815
I don't know.
Well, yeah, yeah.

30:17.900 --> 30:21.068
Yeah, I guess so.
Hey, uh...

30:24.281 --> 30:26.824
You took a really big chance
inviting me
to meet your family.

30:26.909 --> 30:30.745
[Sighs]
Now I'm gonna take a chance.
A big one.

30:40.589 --> 30:44.508
Lindsey, will you
go to opening day with me?

30:47.221 --> 30:50.097
[Giggles]
Yes.

30:50.182 --> 30:52.099
Yes. Yes!

30:52.184 --> 30:54.602
You hear that?
She said yes!

30:54.853 --> 30:56.729
[Imitating Jimmy Stewart]
Mary, look. Merry Christmas.

30:56.813 --> 30:59.232
Clarence, look how
everyone showed up.
It's amaz...

30:59.316 --> 31:02.318
We're going to opening day.
It's official. We're going.

31:02.402 --> 31:04.111
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo!

31:05.530 --> 31:08.699
[Gasps]
What did Dad do
to his hair?

31:08.784 --> 31:11.577
I can't even look at him.
I know.

31:11.662 --> 31:13.829
How could you let him?

31:13.914 --> 31:17.875
He's 60. It's a big
psychological milestone.

31:17.960 --> 31:21.087
He's struggling with it.
He thinks he looks good.

31:21.171 --> 31:24.382
[Barking]

31:24.466 --> 31:27.677
Now don't start with me.
Listen, I forgot to tell you
that Donna...

31:27.761 --> 31:31.180
[Growling]
Stop it! Out!

31:31.598 --> 31:33.683
Outside! Out.

31:34.726 --> 31:36.644
I don't know
what's with him lately.

31:37.354 --> 31:39.814
Oh, I'm sorry.
I forgot to tell you.
Donna called.

31:40.357 --> 31:42.066
And they're
on their way.
Okay.

31:42.150 --> 31:43.776
Good.

31:44.945 --> 31:46.862
[Both Chuckling]

31:46.947 --> 31:51.117
He is scaring the dog.
How can you stand it?

31:51.326 --> 31:54.495
He fanned me with a magazine
for four years when I was
going through menopause.

31:54.579 --> 31:56.998
I can put up with this.

31:57.332 --> 32:01.127
Go back in
and talk to him.
He misses you.

32:01.461 --> 32:04.630
Okay. One more.

32:08.302 --> 32:11.887
[Man On TV]
Yeah, but do you see him ever
playing in a Yankee uniform?

32:11.972 --> 32:13.264
Hi.
Hey, kiddo.

32:13.348 --> 32:15.266
Want a cookie?
No, thanks.

32:15.350 --> 32:17.268
[Man On TV Continues]

32:17.352 --> 32:21.063
Your mama says
you've been busy.
Ooh.

32:21.148 --> 32:24.817
No Red Sox fan
has forgotten last October
and Aaron Boone.

32:24.901 --> 32:27.570
Hey, is this
about the Red Sox?
Yeah.

32:27.654 --> 32:30.614
That next year
is the year.

32:30.699 --> 32:33.242
Steve Levy is in Fort Myers
with some of the members
of the set

32:33.327 --> 32:35.119
known as Red Sox nation.

32:36.705 --> 32:39.373
Down here
in Fort Myers, Florida,
the story is always the same.

32:39.458 --> 32:42.126
When the calendar page
flips to March...
[Continues]

32:42.210 --> 32:43.252
[Dad] Are you interested?

32:43.587 --> 32:45.546
No, I just, you know...

32:45.630 --> 32:49.133
I mean, I have a friend
who is interested.

32:49.885 --> 32:52.261
Oh, the schoolteacher.

32:53.597 --> 32:56.098
When are we gonna meet
this future breakup?

32:56.183 --> 32:59.101
Thanks, Dad.
That's really encouraging.

32:59.978 --> 33:01.896
Well, I thought
you would have
brought him with you.

33:02.564 --> 33:05.983
Well, you know,
he wanted to come.

33:06.068 --> 33:10.654
It's just that, um, well,
he has this tradition,
you know.

33:10.739 --> 33:13.324
And it's very important
to him every...

33:13.408 --> 33:17.703
The Sox are right there!
The Sox are right there!
[Continues Indistinct]

33:18.747 --> 33:21.665
Where do the Sox rank
in terms of importance
in your life?

33:21.750 --> 33:24.502
I'd say Red Sox,
sex and breathing.

33:24.586 --> 33:28.422
I have season tickets to
Fenway Park. I haven't missed
a game in 11 years.

33:28.507 --> 33:31.926
I love the Red Sox.
They're gonna win.
All the way this year, baby!

33:32.010 --> 33:34.470
Do you have a job?
Do you work for a living?

33:34.554 --> 33:37.306
Of course I do.
Yeah, I'm a teacher.
I mold young minds.

33:37.599 --> 33:40.601
Can you help these guys out?
Can you believe
this asshole?

33:40.936 --> 33:45.648
[Indistinct Yelling]

33:49.861 --> 33:51.695
[Ben]
29th of May, Seattle,
all right?

33:51.780 --> 33:53.447
You know what?
I gave it to the lady
down at the bakery.

33:53.532 --> 33:56.242
Ben, all I got so far
is the 21 st and 22nd, man.

33:56.326 --> 33:58.702
We're only on May.
We've been here
for four hours.

33:58.787 --> 34:00.162
Let's try to speed this up.

34:00.247 --> 34:02.832
30th of may,
we're still at Seattle.
Who wants a Sunday game?

34:03.166 --> 34:05.000
These guys can have
whatever games they want.

34:05.085 --> 34:07.044
All I ask for
is the first Yankee game.

34:07.129 --> 34:10.547
You went to six
Yankee games last season,
you selfish pig bastard.

34:10.632 --> 34:13.050
You got to go
to every great game.
Lowe's no-hitter.

34:13.135 --> 34:16.594
Your mother's hysterectomy?
I put her out for free,
remember?

34:16.679 --> 34:20.724
She had insurance for that.
Attention, morons.

34:20.809 --> 34:21.891
You went last year.

34:21.976 --> 34:24.770
You guys want Yankee tickets?
You wanna talk Yankee tickets?

34:24.855 --> 34:26.188
Yes.
Really.

34:26.273 --> 34:29.108
Okay, well, I wanna
see you dance for me.

34:29.192 --> 34:31.652
[Overlapping Chatter]

34:31.735 --> 34:33.654
You don't wanna dance?
I don't wanna embarrass you.

34:33.737 --> 34:36.322
I don't wanna embarrass you.
I'll just take this.
Everyone just go.

34:36.408 --> 34:39.869
I'll go talk to some kids
in the street. I see a little
bit there. That's pretty nice.

34:40.620 --> 34:42.580
That's it. The doctor
is giving me something.

34:42.664 --> 34:45.541
The doctor is giving me
some magic tapping there.

34:45.625 --> 34:48.293
Oh, I like that a lot.
Yeah, that's... Oh!

34:48.378 --> 34:51.797
All right, Little League,
you wanna go?
You want some of this?

34:51.882 --> 34:54.132
How's this, Ben?
This is dancing for tickets.
I'm dancing, Ben.

34:54.217 --> 34:56.135
Troy, sit on
the beanbag, please.
Hey, I started, Ben.

34:56.219 --> 34:58.387
Dance, dance, dance, dance

34:58.472 --> 35:00.014
Gerard, I guess
you don't want them, huh?

35:00.056 --> 35:02.641
This is worth tickets.
I'm not dancing.
This is totally stupid, man.

35:02.726 --> 35:05.519
Fine. Hey, hold out
for the Royals, huh?

35:09.232 --> 35:11.817
You are on
a total power trip,
you know that, man?

35:12.194 --> 35:13.611
This is totally
ridiculous, man.

35:13.695 --> 35:15.279
I was dancing first,
remember?

35:15.363 --> 35:17.948
You said dance,
I started dancing.

35:18.033 --> 35:21.452
You call that Yankee dancing?
No, no, that's like
Devil Ray dancing, okay?

35:21.536 --> 35:23.996
That's Devil Ray.
I'm talking about
Yankee dancing.

35:24.080 --> 35:28.000
That's what I'm talking about.
Yeah, get into it. Yeah!
How bad do you want it?

35:28.126 --> 35:30.753
Yeah, that's nice.
I love it. Come on in.
[Knocking]

35:30.837 --> 35:34.048
That's it!
Come on! Whoo!

35:34.132 --> 35:37.384
Latin hustle to

35:37.636 --> 35:39.345
Yowsah, yowsah, yowsah

35:39.429 --> 35:40.638
That's right. I'm...

[Stops]

35:43.183 --> 35:45.518
Hey, what are you
doing here?

35:45.602 --> 35:47.436
I thought you weren't
coming in until tomorrow.
You look fantastic.

35:47.562 --> 35:50.189
I got in last night.
You know Troy,
Kevin and Gerard.

35:50.273 --> 35:53.025
Everyone else,
this is Lindsey.
Hi.

35:53.109 --> 35:54.109
Hi, Linds.

35:56.071 --> 35:57.988
Party?
No, it's draft day.

35:58.073 --> 36:01.534
This is the day we organize
the whole season, who gets
to go to what game with me.

36:01.618 --> 36:03.786
But don't worry.
You're still going
to opening day.

36:04.204 --> 36:07.957
Yeah, thank you.
Can I talk to you about
something really quickly?

36:08.041 --> 36:10.334
Sure, yeah, no problem.
Quick break, everybody.

36:10.418 --> 36:12.962
There's some nice
Pakistani cold cuts there,
courtesy of Mrs. Segal.

36:13.463 --> 36:16.006
I still don't think
they're worth
two Sunday tickets.

36:16.091 --> 36:17.925
Whoo-hoo!
Hey! Hey!

36:19.928 --> 36:21.762
Come here.

36:22.013 --> 36:23.764
Wait, I got you something.

36:23.848 --> 36:27.101
I set aside
some great games
for you too.

36:27.185 --> 36:30.646
Hmm? For when we go
to the games together.

36:31.106 --> 36:32.273
Thanks.

36:32.482 --> 36:34.608
It's what
the players wear.

36:35.527 --> 36:37.236
It's authentic.

36:40.323 --> 36:43.200
I gotta be honest.
This is getting me hot.

36:43.285 --> 36:48.539
Listen. Um, you know,
I saw you on ESPN.

36:48.623 --> 36:50.666
Oh. We looked like
morons, didn't we?

36:50.750 --> 36:54.920
Uh, yeah, yeah, total.
Not you so much, but...

36:55.005 --> 36:57.715
Well, it's very hot,
you know. It's Florida.

36:57.799 --> 36:59.800
[Chuckles]
You start seeing things.

37:00.218 --> 37:03.679
Um, you know, Ben,

37:03.763 --> 37:09.310
I didn't realize how big
this Red Sox thing is
with you.

37:09.769 --> 37:12.062
What?
Hey, I told you.

37:12.147 --> 37:14.648
See, this is...
This always happens.
Every time I...

37:14.733 --> 37:18.652
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
don't jump off a building.
We're just talking.

37:21.197 --> 37:24.408
Sorry. Knee jerk.
[Troy] Ben, come on, man.
The cold cuts are gone.

37:24.492 --> 37:27.244
Let's go in there.
Two minutes!

37:28.705 --> 37:30.873
Wow. I really hit
a nerve there, didn't I?

37:31.333 --> 37:33.500
Uh...
[Clears Throat]
Yeah.

37:33.835 --> 37:35.169
Come here.

37:36.338 --> 37:38.213
Thank you.

37:38.298 --> 37:42.301
I think there's
a better approach
to this whole Red Sox thing.

37:42.427 --> 37:45.137
Really?
Yeah. After all,
if I want this promotion,

37:45.221 --> 37:48.474
I am going to
have to push myself
really hard this summer.

37:48.558 --> 37:54.188
And I've never really been
very good at servicing myself,
my job and a relationship.

37:54.272 --> 37:56.940
Wait, wait.
We're not breaking up,
are we?

37:57.025 --> 37:59.818
No, no,
this is a good thing.
Okay.

37:59.903 --> 38:01.945
You're gonna be
so consumed with all of this

38:02.030 --> 38:04.073
that you won't
feel neglected all summer.

38:04.157 --> 38:06.158
No, no, yeah,
I'm not gonna
feel neglected.

38:06.242 --> 38:08.744
And I won't feel guilty
for having to do my job.

38:08.828 --> 38:10.496
Yeah, you shouldn't.

38:10.580 --> 38:13.916
So, what I'm saying is,
I think this is perfect.

38:14.000 --> 38:17.378
[Chuckles]
All right. Go, Sox!

38:17.962 --> 38:20.422
Two, three, four
Tessie

38:20.507 --> 38:22.466
Nuff Ced McGreevy shouted

38:22.550 --> 38:24.885
We're not here
to mess around

38:24.969 --> 38:28.347
We got 'em right here, folks.
Come on down. Cut your deficit
and balance your budget.

38:28.431 --> 38:31.141
Hear the crowd roar
to your sound

38:31.226 --> 38:33.143
Programs here!
Get your programs here!

38:33.228 --> 38:35.729
Don't blame us
if we ever doubt you

38:35.814 --> 38:38.565
You know we couldn't live
without you

38:39.234 --> 38:46.365
Tessie, you are
the only, only, only

38:48.952 --> 38:51.495
Hi. Hi.
Hey.

38:53.248 --> 38:55.791
[Man]
Peanuts! Cracker Jacks!

38:55.875 --> 38:59.044
Who wants peanuts?
Who wants Cracker Jacks?

38:59.129 --> 39:02.297
Peanuts! Cracker Jacks!
Who wants...

39:02.382 --> 39:04.550
It's unbelievable, right?
You can't even believe how...

39:04.634 --> 39:07.553
Look, right here, go.
This is it.
Thank you.

39:07.637 --> 39:11.348
Is this amazing?
Is this crazy? Would you
look at these seats?

39:11.433 --> 39:13.183
They're...
They're very red.

39:13.268 --> 39:15.686
No, I mean, their proximity
to the field.
This is Fenway Park.

39:15.770 --> 39:16.812
Oh.

39:16.896 --> 39:18.689
You can't buy these seats.
You have to,
like, inherit them.

39:18.773 --> 39:21.859
It's like a guy
offered me $100,000
for these once.

39:21.985 --> 39:25.028
And you didn't sell them?
No, if I ever need
the money that bad,

39:25.113 --> 39:28.031
I can always call up
a rich old lady and give her
some sweet lovin', you know?

39:28.116 --> 39:29.992
That's what I'm all about.
Hey, what's up, Al?

39:30.160 --> 39:32.661
How you doing?
I'm on dialysis.

39:32.746 --> 39:35.372
Right on, buddy.
Hey, Al, this is Lindsey.

39:35.457 --> 39:37.708
Hi. Al Waterman.
Here, have a sponge.

39:37.792 --> 39:39.877
Thank you.
Al is the first guy
I ever met

39:39.961 --> 39:41.879
at my first
Red Sox game ever.
Really?

39:41.963 --> 39:45.007
Yeah, he's aged horribly.
Hey, the Belnaps.

39:45.091 --> 39:47.801
This is Artie. Viv.
This is Lindsey.
Hello.

39:47.886 --> 39:49.303
Hi, Lindsey.
Hello.

39:49.429 --> 39:51.638
Been divorced 20 years,
still share the seats.
Really.

39:51.723 --> 39:53.599
Hey, Ben.
Sheri!

39:53.725 --> 39:56.310
How you doing?
Where's Teresa?
She's right here.

39:56.644 --> 39:59.021
Oh, my God.
What happened?
You look fantastic!

39:59.230 --> 40:02.232
I lost 200 pounds.
I had my stomach stapled shut.

40:02.358 --> 40:05.319
A doctor
or you did it yourself?
Oh, real funny.

40:05.987 --> 40:07.404
Hey!

40:09.699 --> 40:11.700
This is quite a little group
you have here.

40:11.785 --> 40:14.661
Well, it's
my summer family.

40:14.746 --> 40:18.707
[Boy]
For the land of the free

40:19.334 --> 40:25.547
And the home of the brave

40:25.632 --> 40:29.635
[Crowd Cheering]
[Announcer] Let's hear it
for Jordan Leandre.

40:30.220 --> 40:34.181
Ladies and gentlemen,
throwing out
the first ball today,

40:34.265 --> 40:37.226
New England's own
Stephen King.

40:37.602 --> 40:40.354
[Crowd Cheering]

40:40.438 --> 40:42.564
[Announcer]
Right down the middle.

40:46.736 --> 40:49.488
Did you tell Schuyler?
Okay, all right, listen.

40:49.572 --> 40:53.033
Um, excuse me.
What time is the game over?

40:53.117 --> 40:55.202
Uh, it's not like
a Broadway musical

40:55.286 --> 40:56.495
where it ends with
a big Hawaiian number.

40:56.579 --> 40:59.039
It's like you're missing
all the ambience
and all the fun.

40:59.123 --> 41:01.041
I know.
The players
are right there.

41:01.125 --> 41:04.086
I have a meeting at 5:30
and had to leave work at noon
to meet you here,

41:04.212 --> 41:06.880
so my people
aren't prepared.
Right. Okay.

41:09.717 --> 41:11.802
You know what?
I left work early,

41:11.886 --> 41:14.555
so you're gonna have to
figure it out for yourself,
and I'll call you later.

41:14.639 --> 41:16.265
[Announcer]
Wakefield.

41:23.398 --> 41:24.439
[Groans]

41:26.651 --> 41:28.402
That's a foul.

41:28.486 --> 41:31.446
What makes that a foul?
See that foul pole there?

41:31.531 --> 41:34.032
That's Pesky's Pole.
That's this guy
Johnny Pesky.

41:44.252 --> 41:45.377
Yeah!

41:59.893 --> 42:02.561
Hey, what are you doing
on Saturday?

42:02.645 --> 42:04.605
Mm, you tell me.

42:07.025 --> 42:09.192
You know what's really great
about baseball?
Hmm?

42:09.277 --> 42:11.111
You can't fake it.

42:11.195 --> 42:14.031
Anything else in life,
you don't have to
be great in.

42:14.115 --> 42:16.199
Business, music, art...
I mean, you can get lucky.

42:16.326 --> 42:18.660
Really?
Yeah, you can fool everyone
for a while, you know?

42:18.745 --> 42:20.662
It's like...
Not... Not baseball.

42:20.747 --> 42:22.789
You can either
hit a curveball
or you can't.

42:22.916 --> 42:25.667
That's the way
it works, you know?
Hmm.

42:25.752 --> 42:30.339
You could have a lucky day,
sure, but you can't have
a lucky career.

42:30.632 --> 42:33.467
It's a little like math.
It's orderly.

42:33.676 --> 42:36.845
Win or lose, it's fair.
It all adds up.

42:37.138 --> 42:41.141
It's, like, not as confusing
or as ambiguous as, uh...

42:41.225 --> 42:43.226
Life?
Yeah.

42:44.187 --> 42:46.480
It's... It's safe.

42:49.776 --> 42:51.985
Oh, yeah! Yeah!

42:54.530 --> 42:57.157
[Whooping]

42:57.659 --> 42:58.784
Hey.
Hi.

42:58.868 --> 43:00.369
What, did you buy out
the bookstore?

43:00.453 --> 43:02.788
Actually, I bought
every book they had
on the Red Sox,

43:02.872 --> 43:05.499
because I'm tired of being
the most ignorant person here.

43:05.583 --> 43:08.835
Now who is
Carl Yaz-a-strezem...

43:08.920 --> 43:12.214
[All] Yastrzemski.
[Mouthing Words]

43:12.340 --> 43:14.800
She's not a genius,
this one.
No.

43:15.343 --> 43:20.222
Johnny Damon!
You got the sweetest ass
in the league!

43:22.684 --> 43:24.267
Very nice.

43:26.813 --> 43:30.065
[Scoffs]
Do you believe in this?
"The Curse of the Bambino"?

43:30.149 --> 43:31.692
Hey, that's not funny.
That's enough of that.

43:31.776 --> 43:33.193
But Babe Ruth
was the Bambino.

43:33.277 --> 43:35.195
That's right.
He played for the Red Sox.

43:35.279 --> 43:37.823
They were great.
I mean, they were
the Yankees.

43:37.907 --> 43:41.535
They won the World Series
in 1912, 1915,

43:41.619 --> 43:43.620
1916, 1918.

43:43.705 --> 43:46.123
They were royalty.
The elite.

43:46.207 --> 43:49.251
Al should know.
He was there actually.
He's 136 years old.

43:49.335 --> 43:53.964
He looks great for his age.
1919, their miserable,
greedy pig of a boss

43:54.048 --> 43:57.467
decides to sell Babe Ruth
to the Yankees to finance
a Broadway musical.

43:57.552 --> 44:00.220
No, no, Nanette.
I would never ever
see that piece of crap.

44:00.805 --> 44:04.891
And since 1918,
the Red Sox have not won
a World Series.

44:04.976 --> 44:07.227
Yeah, the Yankees
have won 26.

44:07.311 --> 44:11.231
And the thing is
the Sox don't just lose,
they raise it to an art form.

44:11.315 --> 44:13.650
Tony C.,
best young player in baseball,

44:13.735 --> 44:17.612
catches one in the eye at 22,
he's finished at 26.

44:17.697 --> 44:20.866
Armbrister runs into
Carlton Fisk,
costs us the Series.

44:20.950 --> 44:22.951
Bucky friggin' Dent.
[Viv Groans]

44:23.036 --> 44:26.038
You remember the time
Roger Moret went catatonic?

44:26.122 --> 44:28.248
The grounds crew
had to carry him out
in a wheelbarrow.

44:28.332 --> 44:30.250
Buckner.
[All Groan]

44:30.334 --> 44:32.669
Grady little sticking
with Pedro
in the eighth inning.

44:32.754 --> 44:36.423
Ooh, stop it.
You're killing me here.

44:36.799 --> 44:39.801
And that, milady,
is the Curse of the Bambino.

44:39.886 --> 44:42.512
[Announcer]
Number 19, Gabe Kapler.

44:51.939 --> 44:54.816
Okay, I'm ready.
Let's go meet Mom and Dad.

44:56.360 --> 44:57.486
[Scoffs]

44:59.113 --> 45:00.697
Nothing.

45:00.782 --> 45:04.409
A laugh? A giggle?
This is not
a man's closet.

45:04.535 --> 45:07.079
What do you mean?
You have one pair
of dress shoes.

45:07.163 --> 45:09.873
You're like a man-boy.
Half man, half boy.

45:09.957 --> 45:12.459
You should see the way
my sister's husband dresses.

45:12.543 --> 45:16.755
He had a professional
come in and do his closet.
It's like suit, suit, suit...

45:16.839 --> 45:19.091
All right, okay, okay.
I see what this is all about.

45:19.175 --> 45:21.968
You want your parents
to like me more than they
like your brother-in-law.

45:23.179 --> 45:25.430
No, it's not...
Yes!

45:26.474 --> 45:31.478
[Sighs]
Is it so horrible that
I want my parents to like you?

45:33.397 --> 45:37.150
Okay. I think we have
enough stuff in this closet.
We can fool 'em.

45:37.985 --> 45:39.152
[Mom]
He looks like a skunk.

45:39.403 --> 45:41.238
You're the one that told me
to grow it out.

45:41.322 --> 45:44.908
Well, what else could I say?
It looked ridiculous on you.
A man your age...

45:44.992 --> 45:47.702
Now, I understand
that you're a teacher, right?
You were?

45:47.787 --> 45:49.496
Yes, for 27 years.

45:49.580 --> 45:52.082
And, okay, now you're
the principal, right?
Mm-hmm.

45:52.166 --> 45:55.168
And you...
Did you ever tell me
what your dad does?

45:55.294 --> 45:59.422
I sell golf carts.
Wow. Okay, that gives us
nothing to talk about.

45:59.507 --> 46:01.424
I don't really know much
about it.

46:01.509 --> 46:04.553
That's funny,
'cause every other guy
she's gone out with

46:04.637 --> 46:06.721
has tried to get
a free golf cart
out of me.

46:06.806 --> 46:10.225
No, I like golf. Great sport.
It's just I don't really
get out much, you know?

46:10.476 --> 46:11.852
We love it.
Yeah?

46:11.936 --> 46:14.062
They play all the time.

46:14.147 --> 46:16.648
We tried to get on
the country club here,
but it's very difficult.

46:16.732 --> 46:20.235
It's almost impossible.
I had to call the manufacturer
of my golf carts,

46:20.361 --> 46:23.113
a guy named
Dave Johnson, and said...
Jensen.

46:23.197 --> 46:25.407
No, Dave... Dave Johnson.
Jensen.

46:25.533 --> 46:28.535
Jensen?
Hi. Sorry we're late. He was
watching the Red Sox game.

46:28.619 --> 46:31.163
How'd they do?
No, no.
La, la, la, la, la!

46:31.247 --> 46:33.165
Help me! Help me!
Help me!
What's wrong?

46:33.249 --> 46:36.209
Oh, help me! Help me!
Help me! La la la la!

46:36.294 --> 46:38.670
[Man, Indistinct]
La la la la.
La la la la.

46:38.754 --> 46:40.672
[Making Noises]
Okay. Okay.

46:40.756 --> 46:43.049
It was awesome.
Struck out the side.

46:43.134 --> 46:46.344
Okay, it stopped.
It stopped. Stop it!
Stop it! Stop it!

46:48.222 --> 46:50.473
Whew!
Um...

46:50.600 --> 46:53.685
Thank you.
Yeah. Ben tapes
the Red Sox games,

46:54.228 --> 46:55.645
so he doesn't wanna
know the score.

46:55.730 --> 46:58.815
And he can't
cover his own ears 'cause
he's got lobster fingers,

46:58.900 --> 46:59.900
so I do it.

47:00.985 --> 47:02.903
That's sweet.

47:07.450 --> 47:10.577
Hey, how'd it go last night?
Fabulous.

47:10.745 --> 47:11.995
Mr. Myerson
wants to see you.

47:13.122 --> 47:16.666
Oh, God. If one of
the windows would open,
I would jump.

47:16.751 --> 47:18.585
And your mom's
on line one.

47:20.004 --> 47:24.507
Hi, Mom. Hi.
Listen, where are you?
Can I call you back?

47:26.010 --> 47:28.386
What? You had
a 10:00 a.m. Flight.

47:32.058 --> 47:34.559
My Ben?
Yes, he has been great.

47:34.644 --> 47:37.771
He took us out to breakfast.
Right now he's washing
your father's balls.

47:37.980 --> 47:39.022
What?

47:41.484 --> 47:43.193
Here's one.
Thanks, Ben.

47:43.277 --> 47:45.820
He got us a 10:00 a.m.
Tee time at the country club.

47:47.114 --> 47:48.615
How?

47:49.450 --> 47:52.786
One of his student's fathers
has something to do
with the sprinklers.

47:52.870 --> 47:55.121
Can I talk to him
for a second?
Oh, sure.

47:55.206 --> 47:56.998
Benny? Lindsey.

47:57.083 --> 47:59.167
Oh, thanks.
Hi, Linds.

48:00.002 --> 48:02.128
Hey, what are you doing?

48:02.463 --> 48:03.797
Took a sick day.

48:05.633 --> 48:08.843
All right.
Well, I'll see you
tonight then.

48:08.928 --> 48:11.054
All right. Bye-bye.
Honey...

48:11.138 --> 48:15.267
Uh, sweetheart,
don't talk in my backswing.

48:15.393 --> 48:18.061
Well, you were
lined up wrong.
I wasn't lined up, I...

48:18.145 --> 48:20.522
Please, don't talk
in my backswing. You know
better than that.

48:20.606 --> 48:23.900
Just take a mulligan.
Lighten up.

48:23.985 --> 48:26.569
He's so short with me.
I know. I know.
But you know what?

48:26.696 --> 48:29.406
You talked in his backswing.
Did you talk in his backswing?
Yes, I did.

48:29.490 --> 48:32.033
Don't even look at him.
Look this way. Let him swing.
Okay.

48:39.041 --> 48:42.460
[Crowd Cheering]

48:46.757 --> 48:48.758
Where it began

48:49.802 --> 48:51.928
Manny! Manny! Manny!

48:52.013 --> 48:53.179
I can't begin to know when

48:54.432 --> 48:57.892
But then I know
it's growin' strong

49:02.106 --> 49:03.898
Wasn't the spring

49:05.860 --> 49:08.445
And spring
became the summer

49:09.697 --> 49:12.866
Who'd have believed
you'd come along

49:16.287 --> 49:18.997
Hand

49:20.583 --> 49:23.168
Touching hands

49:24.712 --> 49:26.379
Reaching out

49:27.757 --> 49:29.549
Touching me

49:30.551 --> 49:34.721
Touching you

49:35.056 --> 49:38.058
Sweet Caroline
buh, buh, buh

49:39.935 --> 49:42.979
Good times never
seemed so good

49:43.064 --> 49:45.774
So good, so good, so good

49:46.317 --> 49:48.651
I've been inclined

49:51.072 --> 49:57.827
To believe they never would
and now I

50:00.247 --> 50:02.248
Oh.
[Breathing Heavily]

50:10.049 --> 50:13.134
[Man] She handled a project
for a food service company
like yours a few months ago.

50:13.803 --> 50:17.972
Gave them a model
predicting the impact
of every possibility.

50:18.057 --> 50:19.974
Sounds like what I need.
Morning.

50:20.059 --> 50:22.060
You'll love her.
This lady is a dynamo.

50:22.144 --> 50:24.437
Unstop... pable.

50:28.818 --> 50:32.570
[Clears Throat]
When she wakes up,
I wanna see her.

50:32.655 --> 50:34.656
Well, let's go
for a coffee.

50:34.740 --> 50:37.826
You know
what's happening here?
You're being colonized.

50:37.952 --> 50:41.121
What?
Colonized. It's like...
It's like in the old days.

50:41.664 --> 50:45.208
When the French
and the English would go
into Asia and Africa,

50:45.292 --> 50:46.584
and they'd
raise their flags

50:46.669 --> 50:49.712
and they'd
impose their culture
and they'd colonize.

50:49.797 --> 50:53.508
It's like, Sarah, when you
cut your hair off because
that guy liked short hair.

50:53.592 --> 50:55.593
Wait a minute.
I mean, you guys are married.

50:55.678 --> 50:58.680
Isn't that a part of it,
accommodating each other?

50:58.931 --> 51:01.141
You know, how many kids
are we gonna have?

51:01.475 --> 51:04.727
Where are we gonna live?
What pizza place
are we gonna order from?

51:04.812 --> 51:06.855
Doesn't it require
some pliability?

51:06.939 --> 51:10.525
Because maybe that's something
I've been lacking in my life.

51:10.985 --> 51:12.694
Isn't it affecting your work?

51:13.487 --> 51:15.738
No, not so much.

51:15.823 --> 51:17.740
You know what
I just realized?

51:17.825 --> 51:20.160
You're rooting
for her relationship to fail.

51:20.244 --> 51:21.703
No.
What?

51:21.787 --> 51:23.955
That's right.
Why would I do that?

51:25.499 --> 51:26.499
Never mind.

51:28.127 --> 51:30.003
No. No, come on,
tell me.

51:32.631 --> 51:37.302
All right. You and Lindsey
are both very competitive,
especially with each other.

51:37.386 --> 51:40.763
She's more competitive
than I am.
I am not.

51:40.848 --> 51:43.308
And when you were both
starting out, you were
the more successful one.

51:43.392 --> 51:46.811
But now Lindsey's career
has skyrocketed,
so she's more successful.

51:46.896 --> 51:50.106
But you've had
the personal success,
the marriage.

51:50.191 --> 51:53.485
And if Lindsey
gets that too, then she's
definitely the winner,

51:53.569 --> 51:55.487
so you're rooting
against her.

51:57.990 --> 52:01.826
[Gasps]
Oh, my God.
What did I do?

52:02.703 --> 52:04.787
What the...
That's it.

52:04.872 --> 52:07.373
We are so
not coming here anymore.

52:08.709 --> 52:11.336
[Crowd]
Let's go, Red Sox!

52:11.420 --> 52:13.963
Let's go, Red Sox!

52:14.548 --> 52:17.383
Let's go, Red Sox!
[Cheering]

52:20.721 --> 52:23.223
[Crowd Jeering]

52:23.557 --> 52:27.018
Hey, Ump, get off your knees.
You're blowin' the game!

52:31.815 --> 52:34.984
Al Waterman.
Have a sponge, young man.

52:35.069 --> 52:37.487
She's killing me
with the laptop.

52:37.571 --> 52:38.905
Sitting there
doing her homework.

52:40.366 --> 52:42.575
So, when do you find out
about this promotion thing?

52:42.660 --> 52:44.702
Uh, next month.

52:44.787 --> 52:49.832
Oh, cool. I just wanted to
know how long I gotta put up
with this at the ball games.

52:49.959 --> 52:53.461
Ben, this is my third game
this week.
Oh, no, I know that.

52:53.546 --> 52:56.506
And I always have to leave
at 6:00 to be here on time.

52:56.590 --> 52:59.842
And then we don't get home
till 11:00, then you and I
go at it all night,

52:59.927 --> 53:01.844
and then that's
all time lost.

53:01.929 --> 53:03.846
Really?

53:03.931 --> 53:06.474
Well, when I say lost,
I mean it's time
that I have to make up.

53:06.559 --> 53:09.852
I know.
You know? I already
got my ass chewed out...

53:09.979 --> 53:11.938
Hot dogs here!
By my boss
this week, okay?

53:12.022 --> 53:14.190
Yo!
Hot dogs!

53:14.275 --> 53:16.150
Fenway frank?
Blech.

53:16.443 --> 53:19.445

Mustard, please.
Thank you. What do I owe?

53:43.137 --> 53:46.014
No, they didn't find anything.
She's fine. I swear.

53:46.098 --> 53:48.016
She's lying down right now.
[Phone Beeps]

53:48.100 --> 53:50.435
Molly? Okay, there's
another phone call
coming in, okay?

53:50.519 --> 53:52.812
Check in later.
Okay, bye-bye.

53:52.896 --> 53:55.315
[Phone Beeps]
Hello. Troy.

53:56.317 --> 54:00.069
You're kidding me. Now?
All right, thanks. Bye.

54:01.238 --> 54:02.864
Honey,
you're on television.

54:02.948 --> 54:05.575
[Man On TV]
Come and get 'em
at Cerrone Cadillac.

54:05.659 --> 54:07.285
The Red Sox
picked up the "W."

54:07.369 --> 54:09.579
There was a scary moment
though in this one
in the sixth inning,

54:09.663 --> 54:12.999
when Miguel Tejada
hit a vicious foul ball
off Mike Myers

54:13.083 --> 54:14.500
that actually hit a woman.

54:17.379 --> 54:19.505
[Announcer]
The 0-1 is fouled off
back into the seats.

54:19.590 --> 54:21.924
[Woman] That had to hurt.
Oh!

54:24.470 --> 54:26.596
She was transported
to a local hospital,

54:26.680 --> 54:30.308
but fortunately
she was released
and she's gonna be all right.

54:30.392 --> 54:33.353
[Theme Music]

54:36.273 --> 54:39.108
[TV Off]
It wasn't that bad
actually.

54:39.193 --> 54:41.653
It was actually
very ladylike.

54:41.737 --> 54:46.282
I mean, you just kind of...
slinked out of your chair.

54:46.367 --> 54:48.284
It was pretty limber.

54:49.620 --> 54:52.872
All right.
I'll let you sleep.
No, Ben.

54:54.041 --> 54:55.333
Gah!

54:55.417 --> 54:57.710
You have a whole
nother head up there.

54:58.045 --> 55:01.589
Yeah, well,
the one that can talk
needs to say something.

55:03.050 --> 55:05.718
I don't think that I should go
to the games anymore.

55:06.512 --> 55:09.305
Why?
Because of this?

55:09.390 --> 55:13.226
No, because I'm becoming
someone that I hate.

55:13.310 --> 55:18.106
Someone who gets a boyfriend,
and poof, their entire
prior life just vanishes.

55:18.190 --> 55:21.150
I have to focus
on my work right now.
I have to.

55:21.235 --> 55:25.655
And besides, you'll have
such a better time if you go
with Troy or Gerard

55:25.739 --> 55:27.990
or the bald anesthesiologist.

55:28.075 --> 55:29.909
Come on.
You have to go. Please?

55:30.828 --> 55:34.038
Listen. You go to the games,
and I'll stay at the office.

55:34.123 --> 55:35.748
And when the game is over,

55:35.833 --> 55:38.626
you'll come racing home
like you're scoring
the winning run,

55:38.711 --> 55:40.795
and I'll be here waiting.

55:41.588 --> 55:42.755
Waiting?

I'll be waiting.

What, you'll be waiting
for me?

55:47.094 --> 55:48.928
Yeah.
Ooh.

55:49.012 --> 55:52.974
You know, all this talk
about waiting is making me
not wanna wait.

55:54.101 --> 55:56.018
Ben, I'm concussed.

55:56.103 --> 55:58.688
Yeah, that's kind of
the way I like it.

55:59.356 --> 56:01.524
I have to keep the peas
on my forehead.

Okay, try to balance it.
Okay. It's...

[Knocking]
Hi.

56:12.369 --> 56:13.453
Hello.

56:14.455 --> 56:16.998
I told your bosses,
but I wanted to tell you.

56:17.082 --> 56:19.125
The work you did for us
was brilliant.

56:19.460 --> 56:22.378
Oh. Well,
I really appreciate
you saying that.

Uh, Patrick Lyons,
this is Carrie.
Nice to see you again.

56:25.841 --> 56:27.842
Nice to see you.
Excuse me.

56:29.470 --> 56:31.763
You know, they're really
very lucky to have you here.

56:31.847 --> 56:37.101
Oh, I feel
the same way to be here.
I feel very lucky.

56:39.480 --> 56:42.064
Here, I got it.

56:42.149 --> 56:44.817
Um, thank you.
You're welcome.

56:44.902 --> 56:49.322
I was, um, just trying
to get comfortable.

56:49.406 --> 56:52.492
Well, don't get
too comfortable,
you might fall asleep.

[People Cheering]
[Ben] Come on! Come on!
Use your brain!

56:55.913 --> 56:58.831
Use your brain!
Oh, they're in the lead.
We almost have an answer.

56:58.916 --> 57:00.833
Who's ahead?
Oh, Tammy's in the lead.

57:00.918 --> 57:03.503
We might have a winner!
We might have a winner
right here!

57:03.921 --> 57:07.840
Tammy won!

but you can have
our home game.

57:10.302 --> 57:11.302
Don, what does she win?

57:11.386 --> 57:14.847
Excuse me.
It's a little loud,
don't you think?

57:16.141 --> 57:18.726
Sorry, Mr. Ennis.
The kids' drugs
just kicked in.

57:18.811 --> 57:20.853
[All Laughing]
[Mr. Ennis] Oh, ha ha.

57:21.104 --> 57:23.773
Teenage drug use.
That's great fodder
for comedy.

[Students Laugh]

57:31.323 --> 57:33.157
All right, you guys.
We're almost out of time.
Pack up.

57:33.242 --> 57:35.952

Back, back, back, you animals!

57:40.040 --> 57:44.961
Back! Hey, one of the
10 problems on your handout
will be on the test.

57:45.045 --> 57:48.714
I'm not gonna tell you
which one, so you're gonna
have to learn all of them.

57:48.799 --> 57:49.882

57:49.967 --> 57:53.010
[Mouthing Word]
Seven.

57:59.184 --> 58:02.311
[Bell Rings]
All right,
study, you maniacs.

58:02.396 --> 58:06.482
Remember, this Saturday is
fall tryouts for next spring's
J.V. Baseball.

58:06.567 --> 58:09.610
Just to avoid the confusion
we had last year,
let me say this year

58:09.695 --> 58:12.405
we're looking
for good players.
Hi.

58:13.156 --> 58:14.448
Hey.

58:15.742 --> 58:18.578
How are you doing?
I have very exciting news.
I couldn't wait to tell you.

58:18.954 --> 58:20.621
You got the promotion.
No, no.

58:20.706 --> 58:23.499
Mr. Myerson did call me
into his office
right after we spoke.

58:23.584 --> 58:24.584
I was trying
to play it cool.

58:25.043 --> 58:27.461
But between you and me,
I was ready to wash his balls.

58:27.754 --> 58:30.339
Yeah, see, that joke's
not fun for me.

58:30.424 --> 58:33.050
[Giggles]
I'm sorry.
Let me explain.

58:33.385 --> 58:36.387
There is this European company
that we're trying to make
a deal with, okay?

58:36.471 --> 58:38.389
And what they do...
You know what?

58:38.473 --> 58:41.434
The point is
they're sending me to Paris
to close the deal.

58:41.768 --> 58:44.645
Wow!
And I am taking vous.

58:44.813 --> 58:46.564
Moi?
Oui!

58:46.648 --> 58:48.858
Taking me to Paris?

58:49.902 --> 58:51.485
Oh, this is gonna
be so great.

58:51.570 --> 58:54.906
Okay, I'm gonna cash in
my first-class ticket
and get two seats.

58:54.990 --> 58:58.618
All you have to do,
Mr. Wrightman,
is call in sick tomorrow,

58:58.702 --> 59:01.245
and we're on our way.
Wait, it's tomorrow?

59:01.330 --> 59:03.497
Mm-hmm.
This weekend?
It's now?

59:03.582 --> 59:06.042
Yeah, we'll fly back
Sunday afternoon,
but with the time change,

59:06.126 --> 59:08.085
you'll be back at work
on Monday morning.

59:11.673 --> 59:15.343
Oh, yeah, uh,
I... I gotta be honest.

59:15.427 --> 59:19.555
This isn't
the best weekend for me.
I'm kind of swamped.

59:19.640 --> 59:21.682
Oh, no.
Do you have a lot of work?

59:21.767 --> 59:25.019
Uh, we're two games
out of first,
with three weeks left.

59:25.395 --> 59:28.022
Seattle's coming in
this weekend, and, I mean...

59:28.398 --> 59:30.107
This is when
they need me.

59:30.442 --> 59:31.984
They need you?

59:34.029 --> 59:36.697
Wait a second.
I was just thinking
about it. That's all.

59:36.782 --> 59:38.157
A tip, Ben.

59:38.241 --> 59:42.078
When your girlfriend says,
"Let's go to Paris
for the weekend," you go.

59:42.162 --> 59:44.622
All right, all right.
I'll go. I'll go.

59:44.790 --> 59:48.834
You'll go? You know what?
I have a better idea.
I think I'll take him.

59:54.675 --> 59:56.175
Hey. Just slow down
a second, okay?

59:56.259 --> 59:58.928
Just go and enjoy
your ball game.

59:59.012 --> 01:00:02.515
You know, this is
the second day in a row
you've snapped at me.

01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:04.934
I'm late.
Fine. Go.

01:00:06.061 --> 01:00:07.520
No, Ben.

01:00:09.147 --> 01:00:10.606
I'm late.

01:00:16.530 --> 01:00:17.863
How... How late?

01:00:19.282 --> 01:00:21.367
Um, a week and a half.

01:00:22.828 --> 01:00:25.204
Okay. That's not
that late. Right?

01:00:25.414 --> 01:00:27.331
No. It is for me.

01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:31.502
Okay. Well, you know what?
I mean, we're not
the first people to...

01:00:31.586 --> 01:00:34.296
To, you know... To... 'Cause,
you know, when two people...

01:00:34.381 --> 01:00:36.590
You know.
Deep breaths, Ben.

01:00:36.675 --> 01:00:40.261
[Clears Throat]
Yeah. Why...
Why didn't you say something?

01:00:40.345 --> 01:00:42.722
Why? So we could
both freak out?

01:00:43.098 --> 01:00:45.933
I mean, I wanted to wait
for the right moment.

01:00:46.018 --> 01:00:48.310
And then when this trip
came up, I thought,

01:00:48.395 --> 01:00:50.521
we'll go to Paris,
and I'll tell you there,

01:00:50.605 --> 01:00:52.732
because that did
seem special.

01:00:52.816 --> 01:00:54.817
But, no, you don't see us
tangled up in the sheets

01:00:54.901 --> 01:00:56.652
with the Eiffel Tower
in the window.

01:00:56.737 --> 01:01:00.865
You see the Mariners
are coming and Pedro's
pitching Friday night.

01:01:00.949 --> 01:01:02.867
[Mumbles]
Saturday.
Schilling's on Friday.

01:01:02.951 --> 01:01:06.120
Look. I...
I admit I should have
reacted differently.

01:01:06.204 --> 01:01:07.580
If I ever build
a time machine,

01:01:07.664 --> 01:01:09.248
that's the first place
I'm going back to.

01:01:09.332 --> 01:01:11.625
I'll be like,
"Paris, whoo! I'm in."

01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:14.420
Uh, I...
Really, I'm sorry.

01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:16.630
That's all right.

01:01:16.715 --> 01:01:19.300
[Sighs]
But I have a 4:00 flight
that I have to catch.

01:01:19.384 --> 01:01:22.344
All right. I can pack my bags.
We can put some stuff
together. We can make this.

01:01:22.429 --> 01:01:25.431
No, it's okay.
The trip is already off
to a weird start.

01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:27.349
Y...
Let's just talk about it
when I get back.

01:01:27.434 --> 01:01:28.517
You sure?
Yeah.

01:01:28.602 --> 01:01:29.602
You're sure?
Yeah.

01:01:29.686 --> 01:01:31.604
I could tell them
I'm leaving right now.

01:01:31.688 --> 01:01:33.606
We're going.
No. It's okay.

01:01:34.608 --> 01:01:35.775
You gonna be all right?

01:01:37.903 --> 01:01:40.488
If you give me a kiss
and wish me luck.

01:01:42.949 --> 01:01:45.785
Good luck.
Way to go, Mr. W.

01:01:46.495 --> 01:01:47.787
Yeah.

01:01:48.163 --> 01:01:50.331
Okay. I'll see you
in a couple days. Okay?

01:01:50.415 --> 01:01:52.958
Yeah.
Okay.

01:02:05.972 --> 01:02:08.682
Are you smoking?
What are you doing?
I'm a teacher.

01:02:08.767 --> 01:02:11.227
That's an insult.
Put it out.

01:02:13.355 --> 01:02:14.897
Get back in class.
Come on.

01:02:17.818 --> 01:02:21.278
[Man] So, the 30-year-old
is on course.
He is the four-time...

01:02:21.363 --> 01:02:23.364
[Phone Rings]

01:02:30.455 --> 01:02:32.998
Hello?
[Lindsey] I got it.

01:02:34.209 --> 01:02:36.127
Linds?
Mmm.

01:02:36.211 --> 01:02:38.420
I got it.

01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:41.423
The promotion?
My period.

01:02:45.345 --> 01:02:48.222
I can tell you were sleeping,
so I'll call you later.

01:02:48.306 --> 01:02:51.183
No, no, no.
I'm up. I'm up. I'm up.

01:02:51.268 --> 01:02:53.602
No, it's okay.

01:02:53.687 --> 01:02:55.855
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:03:00.443 --> 01:03:02.695
Hey, Linds.
Yeah?

01:03:04.197 --> 01:03:06.157
Are you okay?

01:03:07.075 --> 01:03:09.076
Yeah.

01:03:15.208 --> 01:03:18.043
Safe flight.
Okay. Bye.

01:03:18.128 --> 01:03:20.129
[Line Clicks]

01:04:27.864 --> 01:04:29.907
I'll get it.
No. I got it.
I got it.

01:04:29.991 --> 01:04:31.742
Thank you.
Want me to take it up?

01:04:31.826 --> 01:04:34.203
No. I'm okay.
I'm just gonna
go upstairs.

01:04:35.455 --> 01:04:37.998
Bye.

01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:40.376
Hey. Linds. Uh...

01:04:44.798 --> 01:04:47.633
Did, uh...
Did you want a baby?

01:04:49.344 --> 01:04:50.719
Eventually.

01:04:52.305 --> 01:04:54.306
Well, eventually you will.

01:04:55.850 --> 01:04:58.269
Well, it certainly
got me thinking.
That's for sure.

01:04:59.312 --> 01:05:01.647
What do you mean?
Ben.

01:05:03.149 --> 01:05:05.276
If I'm with a guy
for 11 months,

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:07.361
and I think I might be
having his child,

01:05:07.445 --> 01:05:09.780
I'm gonna ask myself,
"Is this the guy?"

01:05:10.282 --> 01:05:13.325
And if it is,
"What's this
going to be like?"

01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:17.246
You know, if we're to be
Mr. And Mrs. Ben and Lindsey,
How's this going to work?

01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:19.415
It's like Robin's
birthday party.

01:05:19.499 --> 01:05:21.041
The minute
I got the invitation,

01:05:21.126 --> 01:05:24.336
I had to run to
the refrigerator and check
the Red Sox schedule.

01:05:24.546 --> 01:05:26.922
And the Yankees are playing,
so I know I'm going stag.

01:05:27.007 --> 01:05:31.302
And that's okay.
I'm fine with that.
But how far does it go?

01:05:31.386 --> 01:05:33.721
You know,
"Grandma, don't die
because

01:05:33.805 --> 01:05:35.764
"the Red Sox are
going out on the road,

01:05:35.849 --> 01:05:38.183
so please wait until
they come back to die."

01:05:38.268 --> 01:05:42.396
And, "Doctor, induce labor
because the Oakland A's
are coming in tomorrow."

01:05:42.772 --> 01:05:44.523
Do you remember last winter?

01:05:44.774 --> 01:05:47.318
This is exactly
what you liked about me.

01:05:47.694 --> 01:05:50.779
That I was capable
of having a passionate
commitment with something.

01:05:50.864 --> 01:05:52.489
Uh, a devotion.

01:05:52.574 --> 01:05:56.493
Yes, but you feel it
for the Red Sox, and I was
hoping that someday

01:05:56.578 --> 01:05:58.662
you might redirect that.

01:06:01.666 --> 01:06:04.793
All those things
that you feel
for that team,

01:06:04.878 --> 01:06:08.047
I feel them too,
for you.

01:06:23.772 --> 01:06:26.982
You know what she's saying
to me, Ryan? She's saying
I have an addiction.

01:06:27.067 --> 01:06:29.443
Really? Well, you work
90 hours a week.

01:06:29.527 --> 01:06:33.447
You know, that... But I guess
that addiction's more
socially acceptable, you know.

01:06:33.531 --> 01:06:35.240
Am I wrong?
Am I wrong?

01:06:35.325 --> 01:06:38.660
Well, nobody's really wrong
in these situations.

01:06:38.745 --> 01:06:40.913
I mean, you have
wants and needs.

01:06:40.997 --> 01:06:43.415
She likewise.

01:06:43.792 --> 01:06:46.418
Wait for
your pitch, Miosky!

01:06:48.588 --> 01:06:51.382
But she's great.
She's great.
[Ball Strikes Bat]

01:06:51.466 --> 01:06:53.467
Definitely the best girl
I've ever gone out with.

01:06:53.551 --> 01:06:57.137
The... The smartest,
the funniest,
the best-looking.

01:06:57.222 --> 01:06:59.431
The sex is like
the... Well...

01:07:01.434 --> 01:07:04.103
But there's a reason why
she's 30 and not married.

01:07:04.187 --> 01:07:05.854
I mean, you gotta see
the big deal
she's making about

01:07:05.939 --> 01:07:07.523
her friend's
birthday party.

01:07:07.607 --> 01:07:10.192
Oh, God. She's making
a federal case about it.

01:07:10.276 --> 01:07:14.071
I'm, like, hey, what if
I had to work that night?
What if I had a second job?

01:07:14.155 --> 01:07:17.241
You know?
What if I was doing
charity work? Is that cool?

01:07:17.325 --> 01:07:19.368
What if I'm, like,
finishing a painting?

01:07:19.452 --> 01:07:20.869
Is that...
You understand me now?

01:07:21.037 --> 01:07:22.871
See my point?
It's not the time.

01:07:22.956 --> 01:07:25.332
It's she doesn't respect
how I'm spending my time.

01:07:25.417 --> 01:07:27.876
And now she expects me
to miss a Yankees game?

01:07:27.961 --> 01:07:29.878
[Laughs]
Whatever.

01:07:29.963 --> 01:07:32.339
[Man]
Let's go, Murph.
You're up.

01:07:33.633 --> 01:07:36.218
All right,
Mr. Wrightman.
I gotta bat.

01:07:36.302 --> 01:07:38.804
Let me just leave you
with this thought.

01:07:38.888 --> 01:07:39.972
You love the Sox.

01:07:41.141 --> 01:07:43.350
But have they ever
loved you back?

01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:52.734
Who are you, Dr. Phil?
Get out of here. Go hit...
Go swing the bat.

01:07:56.239 --> 01:07:57.990
[Man Announcing]
The Red Sox
started off tonight

01:07:58.074 --> 01:08:00.492
three games behind
the Yankees.

01:08:00.577 --> 01:08:05.539
Pedro delivers. The ball is
lined over Bellhorn's head
into right center field.

01:08:05.623 --> 01:08:10.002
That'll get another run across
as the Yankees extend
their lead.

01:08:10.086 --> 01:08:13.672
[Jazz]

01:08:15.633 --> 01:08:17.843
[Jazz Continues]

01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:24.183
Benny boy,
I still can't believe
you're not at the Yankee game.

01:08:24.267 --> 01:08:27.060
Yeah, well, if the Yankees
looked that good in a dress,

01:08:27.312 --> 01:08:29.688
I'd be at the game.

01:08:40.992 --> 01:08:42.993
[Glass Clinking]

01:08:44.953 --> 01:08:48.040
There's no way to measure
what she is worth.

01:08:48.124 --> 01:08:50.917
I'm the luckiest man
on the face of the Earth.

01:08:51.002 --> 01:08:53.295
[Crowd Murmuring]
Her, uh...

01:08:53.379 --> 01:08:56.256
Hang on. Hang on.
Okay. "I'm the luckiest man
on the face of the Earth.

01:08:56.341 --> 01:08:58.591
"Her face, her form,
her sweet, loving smile.

01:08:59.093 --> 01:09:02.554
And she even lets me
dance around in her panties
once in a while."

01:09:02.639 --> 01:09:04.515
[All Gasp]
My parents are here!

01:09:04.599 --> 01:09:08.060
[Cheering]
Really embarrassing.
Really bad.

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:09.937
I love you,
birthday girl.

01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:11.522
I love you.

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:27.746
[Pop]

01:09:28.247 --> 01:09:31.667
And so the conversation
turned

01:09:32.252 --> 01:09:35.212
Until the sun went down

01:09:36.046 --> 01:09:39.591
And many fantasies
were learned

01:09:40.718 --> 01:09:42.636
On that day

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:45.514
Keep feeling fascination

01:09:45.598 --> 01:09:48.267
[Jazz]

01:09:49.935 --> 01:09:53.188
Have I a hope
or half a chance

01:09:53.273 --> 01:09:57.276
To even ask
if I could dance with you

01:09:59.237 --> 01:10:00.779
Yoo-hoo

01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:06.577
Would you greet me
or politely turn away

01:10:08.204 --> 01:10:13.041
Would there suddenly be
sunshine on a cold and

01:10:13.126 --> 01:10:14.376
[Vocalizing: "Dirty Water"]

01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:17.170
[Man On Radio]
Yankee bats
have come alive tonight.

01:10:17.255 --> 01:10:19.631
What's up, my man?
Oh. The game.

No, no. Hey.
It's fine. It's fine.

successful so far against
this powerful Yankee offense.

6-0, Yankees.

01:10:29.726 --> 01:10:31.602

the left fielder,
Hideki Matsui.

01:10:31.686 --> 01:10:33.061
Timlin to the belt.

01:10:33.146 --> 01:10:34.813
Here's the pitch.
[Ball Dings Against Bat]

01:10:34.897 --> 01:10:37.316
Swung on.
A drive hit high and deep.

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:39.401
And this one is gone.

01:10:39.485 --> 01:10:42.112
7-0.
Matsui has hit his second
home run of the night.

01:10:42.196 --> 01:10:44.323
Hey. It's only a game.

01:10:47.869 --> 01:10:49.828
That was like...

01:10:50.997 --> 01:10:53.415
Yeah.

I mean...
I mean, you were...

01:10:56.669 --> 01:10:59.046
Thank you.

01:10:59.130 --> 01:11:02.007
Not... Not just physically.

01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:06.094
I mean, it felt like...
Like we were...

01:11:07.847 --> 01:11:09.848
Mm-hmm.
[Chuckles]

01:11:12.185 --> 01:11:15.145

the greatest night of my life.

Hold on.
I think it's Troy.
It's really noisy.

Hey. Do you want
some food?
Yeah.

01:11:38.961 --> 01:11:41.421
Okay.
Hello?

Hey, what's that noise?

Ben, we won! We won!

01:11:46.886 --> 01:11:49.346
We were losing 7-0
in the bottom of the ninth!

01:11:49.430 --> 01:11:51.682
We scored eight runs!
Ten straight hits!

01:11:51.766 --> 01:11:55.519
It was unbelievable, man!
It's the greatest night
in the history of Fenway Park!

Can you hear this?
It's bedlam here, man!

01:11:59.232 --> 01:12:03.068
Yes! By... by the end,
the stands were
literally shaking!

01:12:03.152 --> 01:12:04.236

had to get the...

01:12:04.529 --> 01:12:06.780
[Indistinct]
To stop jumping up and down!

01:12:08.658 --> 01:12:10.826
The one game you missed!

01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:13.870
You missed
the greatest game ever!

[Yelling]
[Beeps Off]

01:12:18.126 --> 01:12:21.586
[Cheering On TV]
This is an historic night,
Natalie.

01:12:21.671 --> 01:12:27.426
And word is these
tickets stubs are already
getting $200 on the street.

01:12:27.927 --> 01:12:31.680
I have seen at least
a dozen women celebrating
topless in the streets.

01:12:31.764 --> 01:12:36.017
Moments ago I witnessed
a nun dancing on top of
a moving vehicle.

01:12:36.102 --> 01:12:40.188
I have seen police officers
toasting beer
with underage children.

01:12:40.273 --> 01:12:41.565
It is absolute bedlam
down here.

01:12:41.649 --> 01:12:44.276
Right now I think
we're witnessing
the largest conga line ever.

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:46.528
I tell you what.
If you are not down here
right now,

01:12:46.612 --> 01:12:48.447
you're missing
one heck of a party.

01:12:50.074 --> 01:12:52.033
[Whimpers]

01:12:52.118 --> 01:12:56.705
There are three eggs
in Spanish omelet

01:12:56.789 --> 01:13:00.000
[Whistling]

01:13:00.293 --> 01:13:02.836
Hi. Would you like
an omelet?

01:13:04.464 --> 01:13:06.465
They... Won.

01:13:06.549 --> 01:13:08.550
The Red Sox?

01:13:08.634 --> 01:13:11.511
Oh, good!
This really is your night.

01:13:11.596 --> 01:13:12.929
No. You don't understand.

01:13:13.014 --> 01:13:15.807
They scored eight runs
in the bottom
of the ninth to win 8-7.

01:13:15.892 --> 01:13:19.186
It was the best game ever.
I... I can't...

01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:21.271
I... I never miss a game.

01:13:21.355 --> 01:13:23.607
Ever.
This is like a nightmare.

01:13:24.025 --> 01:13:27.027
No, this is beyond that.
This is like a punishment
from God or something.

01:13:27.111 --> 01:13:29.863
Two minutes ago you said
this was the best night
of your life.

01:13:29.947 --> 01:13:32.199
Yeah. Two minutes ago
it was.

01:13:33.034 --> 01:13:35.243
Hey. I didn't tell you
not to go.

01:13:35.328 --> 01:13:37.204
Oh, no. No, no.
Of course not. No.

01:13:37.288 --> 01:13:39.915
You had nothing to do with it.
I just suddenly had a whim,

01:13:39.999 --> 01:13:43.460
after 11 years of never
missing an inning, to suddenly
not go to a Yankees game.

01:13:43.878 --> 01:13:46.046
[Lindsey] Hey.
[Whimpers]

01:13:47.465 --> 01:13:50.759
Wasn't it you yourself
that said just tonight,

01:13:50.843 --> 01:13:52.177
"It's only a game"?

01:13:52.595 --> 01:13:55.055
Oh, that's great.
That's great.
Pile it on. Yeah.

01:13:55.181 --> 01:13:58.183
Kick me when I'm down.
That's great.
It is just a game.

01:13:58.351 --> 01:14:00.477
Clearly, it's not
just a game!

01:14:00.853 --> 01:14:04.147
If it was,
then obviously I wouldn't
care about it this much.

01:14:04.232 --> 01:14:05.690
Twenty-three years.

01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:08.193
Do you still care about
anything you cared about
23 years ago?

01:14:09.153 --> 01:14:11.488
How about 10?
How about five?

01:14:11.572 --> 01:14:14.533
Name me a single thing
that you've cared about
for 23 years.

01:14:16.285 --> 01:14:21.289
Yeah. No, um,
there isn't actually anything
I've wanted for 23 years

01:14:21.457 --> 01:14:23.959
because 23 years ago
I was seven,

01:14:24.043 --> 01:14:28.713
and if I still wanted to marry
Scott Baio, I would think that
my life went terribly wrong.

01:14:31.008 --> 01:14:34.010
I... I just thought tonight
was so different.

01:14:34.095 --> 01:14:36.096
You broke my heart, Ben.

01:14:37.181 --> 01:14:38.849
Hey.

01:14:51.445 --> 01:14:53.530
[Shouting, Faint]

01:14:55.491 --> 01:14:57.534
Awesome!
Whoo-hoo!

01:14:57.618 --> 01:14:59.536
Wow!

01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:02.414
Wow!
Yeah, baby!

01:15:06.377 --> 01:15:08.753
[Man Announcing]
Well, the Red Sox's
once-promising season

01:15:08.838 --> 01:15:11.590
has certainly taken
a turn for the worse.

01:15:12.758 --> 01:15:17.137
Losing the last three games,
and today trailing
to the Texas Rangers.

01:15:17.722 --> 01:15:19.180
Curse of the Bambino.

01:15:19.265 --> 01:15:21.683
To think we quit our jobs
for that road trip.

01:15:21.767 --> 01:15:23.685
It's not a curse.

01:15:23.769 --> 01:15:27.272
Did you know the Titanic
sank the same week
Fenway Park opened?

01:15:27.607 --> 01:15:29.316
April 1912.

01:15:34.530 --> 01:15:36.615
Oh, you...

01:15:36.699 --> 01:15:38.992
[Crowd Booing]
Well, that's it.

01:15:39.076 --> 01:15:41.077
The Yankees officially
clinch the division.

01:15:41.162 --> 01:15:44.706
Seven years in a row now,
we finish with our faces
in their butts.

01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:48.418
Hey, hey, hey.
It's not time to jump off
the Tobin Bridge yet, okay?

01:15:48.502 --> 01:15:50.045
We still have the wild card.

01:15:50.129 --> 01:15:53.632
Oh, that's easy.
First we gotta beat Oakland
or Anaheim, on the road.

01:15:53.716 --> 01:15:56.176
Then we gotta play
the Yankees
in the house of pain.

01:15:56.469 --> 01:15:59.012
Why do we inflict this
on ourselves?

01:15:59.096 --> 01:16:00.805
Why?

01:16:00.890 --> 01:16:02.807
I'll tell you why.

01:16:02.975 --> 01:16:05.352
'Cause the Red Sox
never let you down.

01:16:05.937 --> 01:16:08.772
Huh?
That's right. I mean...

01:16:08.856 --> 01:16:11.608
Why? 'Cause they haven't
won a world series
in a century or so?

01:16:11.692 --> 01:16:14.110
So what?
They're here.

01:16:14.195 --> 01:16:16.571
Every April, they're here.

01:16:16.656 --> 01:16:20.116
At 1:05 or at 7:05,
there is a game.

01:16:20.201 --> 01:16:23.620
And if it gets rained out,
guess what.
They make it up to you.

01:16:23.955 --> 01:16:25.914
Does anyone else
in your life do that?

01:16:25.998 --> 01:16:27.874
The Red Sox
don't get divorced.

01:16:28.167 --> 01:16:31.378
This is a real family.
This is the family
that's here for you.

01:16:31.462 --> 01:16:34.214
You know, I don't ask her
to give up her family, do I?

01:16:34.298 --> 01:16:38.385
Come on!
Let's get some runs!
Let's get some runs!

01:16:38.719 --> 01:16:42.180
You know the best part?
I can get over her
because I am a Red Sox fan.

01:16:42.974 --> 01:16:46.059
I mean, I'm tough.
I've been through a lot
in this park, man.

01:16:46.143 --> 01:16:48.019
I can take this.

01:16:48.104 --> 01:16:50.188
Because I am bulletproof.

Oh, my God.
The Buckner game?

01:17:22.638 --> 01:17:24.472
I thought you took
that away from him!
I did!

It wasn't just Buckner.
Stanley screwed him.

01:17:42.742 --> 01:17:44.075
He didn't cover first.

01:17:44.410 --> 01:17:47.370
Where'd you get this?
I... I don't remember.

01:17:47.496 --> 01:17:50.040
Don't lie to me.
Right. Do you have
any more of these?

01:17:50.124 --> 01:17:52.083
Huh? Where's your stash?

01:17:52.418 --> 01:17:54.252
Ben, this isn't
helping you.

01:17:55.004 --> 01:17:57.881
You understand that?
This solves nothing!

01:17:58.591 --> 01:18:00.383
Ben, look at you.

01:18:00.468 --> 01:18:01.926
Yeah, leave me alone.

01:18:04.221 --> 01:18:07.265
All right.
Let's clean him up.
[Gerard] Come on.

01:18:07.349 --> 01:18:10.060
I let her down.
Let's go.

01:18:10.144 --> 01:18:12.270
I am the Red Sox.
You're not
the Red Sox.

01:18:12.354 --> 01:18:14.481
I am the Red Sox.
You're not the Red Sox.

01:18:15.608 --> 01:18:17.275
Get him up on the shoulder
there, Gerard.

01:18:17.359 --> 01:18:19.486
I got the
shoulder right now.

01:18:19.570 --> 01:18:22.906
What are you doing?
Relax. I'm a doctor.

01:18:22.990 --> 01:18:26.993
Yeah, well, not to pry,
Doc, but why are you
shaving my balls?

01:18:28.871 --> 01:18:32.040
Well, if you don't
want me to...
No, I don't want you to.

01:18:32.124 --> 01:18:34.125
Whatever.

[Man #1]
Bottom of the 10th.

01:18:42.093 --> 01:18:44.719
[Man #2]
Swing and a fly ball
to left field! Way back!

01:18:44.804 --> 01:18:47.347
Way back!
The Red Sox are going

01:18:47.431 --> 01:18:50.141
to the American League
Championship Series

01:18:50.226 --> 01:18:52.936
on the back of David Ortiz!

01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:54.604
All right. You've been
waiting all year for this.

01:18:54.688 --> 01:18:57.941
The Yankees, Red Sox,
the best rivalry in sports
starts tonight.

01:18:58.025 --> 01:19:00.443
8:00, Yankee stadium.
Let's get it on.

01:19:00.736 --> 01:19:03.613
[Man Announcing]
The 2-2 pitch.
Mueller back to Rivera.

01:19:03.697 --> 01:19:06.908
To second for one.
On to first. Double play!

01:19:06.992 --> 01:19:09.077
And the Yankees take game one.

01:19:09.912 --> 01:19:13.248
[Man Announcing]
The Yankees are a strike away.
Here's a 1-2 pitch.

01:19:13.332 --> 01:19:16.417
Struck him out swinging
that'll wrap it up.

01:19:16.502 --> 01:19:20.421
For the second night in a row,
the Yankees have beaten
the Red Sox.

01:19:21.507 --> 01:19:24.425
Here's a 2-0.
Mueller flies to center.

01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:27.929
Bernie Williams is there,
and the Yankees have won it.

01:19:28.013 --> 01:19:31.141
The end of a long night,
and perhaps the end for
the Boston Red Sox,

01:19:31.225 --> 01:19:35.061
losing tonight 19-8,
now falling in the series
three games to none.

01:19:35.146 --> 01:19:37.647
I mean, this thing is over.
They keep swinging the bats

01:19:37.731 --> 01:19:39.691
the way they are, Don,
this thing's done.

01:19:44.196 --> 01:19:46.531
19-8. Good God.

01:19:46.824 --> 01:19:49.367
Will you stop
saying that? Okay?

01:19:50.202 --> 01:19:53.079
Now, who we pitching
tomorrow?
What's the difference?

01:19:53.164 --> 01:19:55.623
We're losing
three games to nothing
to the Yankees.

01:19:55.708 --> 01:19:58.543
In a hundred years,
no team in the play-offs
has ever come back from that.

01:19:58.878 --> 01:20:02.422
It's over. It's finished.
Bye. Wave to it.
Bye, Charlie. Bye, Charlie.

01:20:02.506 --> 01:20:06.176
Oh. Isn't that
Jason Varitek?

01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:09.554
[Kevin]
Yeah. That is him.

01:20:09.638 --> 01:20:11.556
With Johnny Damon and Trot.

01:20:11.682 --> 01:20:14.142
[Troy]
They're eating.
So what?

01:20:14.226 --> 01:20:17.437
So what? We're sitting here
dining on our guts
over the Red Sox.

01:20:17.521 --> 01:20:20.356
And there three members
of the Red Sox are eating.

01:20:20.441 --> 01:20:22.483
With gusto?

01:20:22.568 --> 01:20:24.777
Ironic.
Ironic?

01:20:24.862 --> 01:20:27.864
Ted Williams would roll over
in his freezer if he saw this.

01:20:28.324 --> 01:20:29.949
[Gerard]
Would you please be cool?

01:20:30.492 --> 01:20:32.243
Why shouldn't they eat?

01:20:32.328 --> 01:20:35.288
They... They played hard.
They did their best. Move on.

01:20:38.292 --> 01:20:40.251
I kind of envy these guys.

01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:43.254
You know. No.
They understand something
that we don't.

01:20:44.715 --> 01:20:46.216
Their whole life
isn't out in that field.

01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:48.468
It's their job.
It's not an obsession.

01:20:50.137 --> 01:20:52.138
My God!

01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:54.098
It's official.
I'm an idiot.

01:21:02.775 --> 01:21:04.943

01:21:05.027 --> 01:21:07.403

came back here after.

talk to him, okay?

01:21:56.078 --> 01:21:58.746

Yeah. I'm good. Thanks.

Are you...
Are you on a date?
No. It's...

01:22:05.838 --> 01:22:07.255
It's a work thing.

01:22:07.339 --> 01:22:10.800

so, you know... Carrie

01:22:10.884 --> 01:22:12.677

01:22:12.761 --> 01:22:15.346

That's perfect.
That's great.

doing here?

01:22:17.308 --> 01:22:19.350
I... I wanted to
talk to you. I...

01:22:20.936 --> 01:22:23.062
I can't believe
you're on a date.
This is like...

01:22:23.188 --> 01:22:26.399
I'm not.
Yeah, well, you know what?
Look. I'll call ya.

01:22:26.483 --> 01:22:28.526
Sorry I bothered you.
I'll call ya.

01:22:29.778 --> 01:22:31.571
No, no.
This is crazy.
I'm sorry.

01:22:31.655 --> 01:22:34.907
I came here for a reason.
All right. Look.
I love you, Lindsey.

01:22:35.242 --> 01:22:38.494
And I think that we should
give this another chance.

01:22:40.331 --> 01:22:43.249
Did you hear me?
Ben...

01:22:43.792 --> 01:22:45.585
Oh... Look, look, look.

01:22:45.669 --> 01:22:48.087
You finish your evening.
All right?
I'll hang out here,

01:22:48.172 --> 01:22:50.048
and when you're done
with your date,
we'll get married.

01:22:54.261 --> 01:22:55.803
I don't think so.

01:22:57.222 --> 01:22:59.265
Hey. What are you saying?
I mean...

01:22:59.350 --> 01:23:00.808
You know, you said
you wanted more.

01:23:00.893 --> 01:23:04.228
I mean, this is
as more as there is.
There is no more.

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:07.106
Yes. But this isn't you.
This is the other guy.

01:23:07.399 --> 01:23:09.233
What other guy?
It's October.

01:23:09.568 --> 01:23:13.029
They're one game from
elimination. You're becoming
Winter Guy again.

01:23:13.113 --> 01:23:15.073
I already know
I like Winter Guy.

01:23:15.157 --> 01:23:17.367
It's Summer Guy
that broke my heart.

01:23:17.743 --> 01:23:19.410
Summer Guy is gone.

01:23:20.245 --> 01:23:22.205
Yes, until summer.

01:23:22.289 --> 01:23:25.083
No, no, no. Look.
Lindsey, I realize, like...
Ben,

01:23:26.710 --> 01:23:29.045
just too much
has happened.

01:23:31.256 --> 01:23:32.673
Oh.

01:23:32.758 --> 01:23:34.592
All right.
Look, look. Uh...

01:23:34.676 --> 01:23:37.387
When the whole
baby thing happened,
I admit I froze.

01:23:37.471 --> 01:23:40.515
All right. I thought of
a million different reasons
why I shouldn't be a father.

01:23:40.599 --> 01:23:43.601
But then I thought of
a reason why I should.

01:23:43.685 --> 01:23:45.686
Because it would be ours.

01:23:45.771 --> 01:23:48.731
You know, it's pieces of us.
And I got so excited.

01:23:48.816 --> 01:23:51.192
I mean, like, I went,
and I got a whole bunch
of Red Sox toys...

01:23:51.276 --> 01:23:53.528
And a little
size-one Red Sox jersey,

01:23:53.612 --> 01:23:56.197
like, for a player
to be named later.

01:23:56.698 --> 01:23:59.117
I still have it
for... Whenever.

01:24:02.371 --> 01:24:04.914
Ben, I just got so hurt.

01:24:04.998 --> 01:24:06.999
Really hurt.

01:24:08.460 --> 01:24:10.461
And sometimes,

01:24:10.546 --> 01:24:12.547
when that happens...

01:24:14.216 --> 01:24:17.677
[Sighs]
Something inside
just shuts off.

01:24:21.849 --> 01:24:23.808
I'm sorry.

01:24:31.650 --> 01:24:33.651
[Sobs]

01:24:40.951 --> 01:24:44.412
I never felt magic
crazy as this

01:24:46.582 --> 01:24:50.168
I never saw moons
knew the meaning of the sea

01:24:51.545 --> 01:24:55.256
I never held emotion
in the palm of my hand

01:24:56.842 --> 01:25:00.511
Or felt sweet breezes
in the top of a tree

01:25:00.888 --> 01:25:02.513
But now you're here

01:25:04.725 --> 01:25:08.019
Brighten my northern sky

01:25:09.521 --> 01:25:11.689
Oh. None for me.
[Robin]
Oh, come on.

01:25:11.815 --> 01:25:13.483
Since when did
you stop drinking?
Yeah.

01:25:13.567 --> 01:25:16.027
Since I... Got pregnant.

01:25:16.111 --> 01:25:18.029
[All Gasp]

01:25:18.113 --> 01:25:20.907
Molly.
I knew it!

01:25:20.991 --> 01:25:22.992
You did not.
Mm-hmm.

01:25:23.076 --> 01:25:25.995
I told Lindsey. I said,
"Her boobs look engorged."
Was Steve excited?

01:25:26.079 --> 01:25:28.831
Are you kidding? He ran out
and bought him... Her...

01:25:28.916 --> 01:25:31.000
A little train engineer hat.
[Cell Phone Rings]

01:25:31.126 --> 01:25:33.794
Oh, I'm sorry.
They do that, don't they?
Little hats...

01:25:33.879 --> 01:25:36.422
Hello. It's Chris!
You gotta come with me.

01:25:36.548 --> 01:25:39.675
Molly's pregnant.
Mr. Myerson just announced
you got the promotion.

01:25:39.801 --> 01:25:43.346
Oh, God! Sorry.
Oh, my God.
Now my breasts are engorged.

01:25:43.472 --> 01:25:45.973
That was Lindsey.
She got her promotion.
[Carrie] He's waiting.

01:25:46.058 --> 01:25:47.141
He's holding champagne.

01:25:47.226 --> 01:25:49.310
Everybody's got a glass.
I told him you're in
the ladies' room.

01:25:49.394 --> 01:25:51.312
Oh. Thank you. Okay.
[Laughs]

01:25:51.396 --> 01:25:54.440
Well... Wait.
I gotta... I'm so sorry.
I gotta go.

01:25:54.525 --> 01:25:56.025
Go, go.

01:25:56.109 --> 01:25:57.777
I gotta go.
Guess what Chris is
doing right now.

01:25:57.861 --> 01:26:00.446
He's buying Ben's
baseball tickets.

01:26:00.948 --> 01:26:02.823
What?

01:26:02.908 --> 01:26:05.284
Ben is selling Chris
his Red Sox tickets.

01:26:05.410 --> 01:26:08.829
Lindsey, please. Let's go!
Wait. You mean, like,
um, for today.

01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:13.459
No. I mean, like, forever.
For 125,000,
it better be forever.

01:26:13.752 --> 01:26:16.170
Are you guys that rich?

01:26:16.713 --> 01:26:18.172
Yeah.

01:26:18.257 --> 01:26:20.258
Why don't you
dress better?

01:26:20.592 --> 01:26:22.176
Wait. Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

01:26:22.261 --> 01:26:25.888
Ben... My Ben... is selling
his Red Sox seats?

01:26:25.973 --> 01:26:28.808
To hell with the seats.
They're holding champagne.

01:26:29.101 --> 01:26:30.810
Come on.

01:26:31.353 --> 01:26:34.313
[Crowd]
Let's go, Red Sox!
[Clapping]

01:26:34.398 --> 01:26:36.482
Let's go, Red Sox!

01:26:38.443 --> 01:26:40.695
You know,
what you're doing is illegal.

01:26:40.779 --> 01:26:43.030
That's right. Technically,
if you give up your tickets,

01:26:43.115 --> 01:26:45.157
you're supposed to give 'em
to the Red Sox.

01:26:45.242 --> 01:26:48.286
Hey. We're friends. Okay?
They'll still be in his name.

01:26:48.370 --> 01:26:51.122
They'll mail them to him,
then he'll give them to me.

01:26:51.206 --> 01:26:53.165
Does the guy with
the big squash always sit
in front of you?

01:26:53.250 --> 01:26:54.375
He's new.

01:26:54.459 --> 01:26:56.544
I don't know.
You want the tickets or not?

01:26:56.628 --> 01:26:59.005
Come on. Ow!
Shame on you.

01:26:59.089 --> 01:27:01.716
Your Uncle Carl
saw 3,000 games
from these seats.

01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:04.969
He's gonna come back
and haunt you for this.

01:27:05.053 --> 01:27:08.264
[Applause]
[Man] Speech!

01:27:10.183 --> 01:27:11.726
Let's go. Come on.

01:27:11.810 --> 01:27:14.812
Well, first,
thank you, Mr. Myerson.

01:27:14.896 --> 01:27:16.314
Um...
[Clears Throat]

01:27:16.398 --> 01:27:19.275
The truth is
I... I like it here.

01:27:19.359 --> 01:27:20.776
I like this work.

01:27:21.653 --> 01:27:23.613
I know what I'm doing
when I'm here.

01:27:24.656 --> 01:27:27.074
In fact,
it's the only place...

01:27:27.159 --> 01:27:29.368
Where I know what I'm doing.

01:27:30.162 --> 01:27:32.163
This is, uh, controllable.

01:27:33.415 --> 01:27:35.416
It's safe.

01:27:37.377 --> 01:27:39.170
Oh, my God.

01:27:39.254 --> 01:27:42.465
He's selling
his Red Sox tickets for me.

01:27:42.549 --> 01:27:45.593
What have I ever
given up for anybody
that meant that much?

01:27:45.677 --> 01:27:48.679
I'm sorry.
I know this seems crazy,
but I gotta go.

01:27:49.681 --> 01:27:51.182
You realize
you're selling your seats

01:27:51.266 --> 01:27:53.517
for exactly the same price
they sold Babe Ruth for.

01:27:53.602 --> 01:27:57.355
You said it yourself.
Relationships come and go,
but the Red Sox are forever.

01:27:57.981 --> 01:27:59.899
I want my sponges back.

01:28:00.025 --> 01:28:03.027
Would you be selling these
tickets if we were winning?
I bet you wouldn't.

01:28:03.654 --> 01:28:05.404
We're never winning.
That's the point.

01:28:05.489 --> 01:28:07.365
We're down three games
to nothing. It's 4-3.

01:28:07.449 --> 01:28:09.450
They got Rivera warming up
in the bull pen. Look.

01:28:09.534 --> 01:28:11.494
[Man On P.A.]
Designated hitter. Number 18.

01:28:11.578 --> 01:28:13.412
John Olerud.

01:28:13.497 --> 01:28:16.457
Look. If I keep
these seats,

01:28:16.625 --> 01:28:18.876
all I'll think about
every time I'm here is...

01:28:20.087 --> 01:28:22.213
Is what I gave up for them.

01:28:22.297 --> 01:28:24.131
[Tires Squeal]

01:28:24.216 --> 01:28:26.217
[Tires Screech]

01:28:29.721 --> 01:28:31.972
Excuse me.
Is there a ticket window
somewhere?

01:28:32.099 --> 01:28:34.767
Sold out, sweetie.
It's the play-offs.
All right.

01:28:34.893 --> 01:28:37.395
Hey. Hey.
You need tickets?
Oh. You too.

01:28:37.479 --> 01:28:38.938
No, no.
I got tickets.

01:28:39.606 --> 01:28:41.941
We... Then why the sign?
That's for the cops.

01:28:42.025 --> 01:28:44.443
Everybody knows when you say
you need tickets,
means you have tickets.

01:28:44.569 --> 01:28:47.905
Okay. I need a ticket.
Calm down.
I got two. 300 apiece.

01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:49.990
What?
Hey. The only reason
they're that cheap

01:28:50.075 --> 01:28:52.034
is because
it's the eighth inning.
Fine.

01:28:52.119 --> 01:28:54.870
I'll take one.
I can't split 'em up.

01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:02.336
Thank you.
Hey, hey.
You know what?

01:29:02.421 --> 01:29:06.298
Since you only need the one
ticket, I'll buy the other one
back for, like, 50 bucks.

01:29:06.383 --> 01:29:08.926
Oh, okay.
That sounds good. Oops.

01:29:09.010 --> 01:29:10.678
Enjoy the game.

01:29:11.722 --> 01:29:15.725
[Cheering]
Ben, how do you know
she'll even take you back?

01:29:16.101 --> 01:29:18.853
It's... It's not just
for her, okay?
It's also for me, okay?

01:29:18.937 --> 01:29:21.939
I gotta get
my life in order.
Some perspective.

01:29:22.023 --> 01:29:23.941
Some balance.
Hey. We've got a deal.

01:29:24.776 --> 01:29:26.318
I'll buy your seats.

01:29:27.863 --> 01:29:29.447
It's a real ticket.

01:29:29.531 --> 01:29:31.699
Oh, it's a real ticket,
but you're at
the wrong entrance.

01:29:31.783 --> 01:29:33.033
You're way over
in center field.

01:29:33.118 --> 01:29:34.660
I just gotta get in
for a minute...

01:29:34.745 --> 01:29:37.705
That's a ploy.
I know it's a ploy.
You're in center field.

01:29:37.914 --> 01:29:39.123
Fine.

01:29:40.584 --> 01:29:42.209
[Man Announcing]
Ground ball
to the right side.

01:29:42.294 --> 01:29:44.462
A race to the bag.
Rivera is there.

01:29:44.546 --> 01:29:48.716
And the Yankees are three
defensive outs away
from the World Series.

01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:49.884
Into the ninth.

01:29:54.097 --> 01:29:56.056
Excuse me.

01:29:56.141 --> 01:29:58.309
Excuse me. Ooh. Sorry.

01:29:58.518 --> 01:30:00.519
Excuse me.
[Woman]
Watch it.

01:30:00.604 --> 01:30:02.813
Excuse me. Sorry.

01:30:07.486 --> 01:30:09.820
Can I borrow these
for a second? Thank you.
Yeah.

01:30:09.905 --> 01:30:11.906
Sure.

01:30:21.291 --> 01:30:23.292
No.

01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:25.503
Why don't you have
a cell phone, you idiot?

01:30:26.505 --> 01:30:29.256
Sign by the red tab.
Initial by the yellow tabs.

01:30:29.674 --> 01:30:32.218
What are you buying,
the stadium?
Look at that thing.

01:30:32.302 --> 01:30:35.513
Floyd the Barber,
we're not in Mayberry, okay?
Thank you.

01:30:37.682 --> 01:30:39.934
Hey. Down in front.
Come on, sweetie.

01:30:40.018 --> 01:30:42.019
Hold your horses, buddy.

01:30:42.103 --> 01:30:44.271
[Panting]

01:30:44.356 --> 01:30:46.398
Robin. Wait. No.
I can't talk right now.

01:30:46.483 --> 01:30:48.526
Listen. I just need
Chris's cell phone number.

01:30:55.283 --> 01:30:57.910
[Scoffs]

01:31:01.456 --> 01:31:03.958
[Cell Phone Rings]
That's odd.

01:31:04.042 --> 01:31:06.001
You're having a stroke.
Good.

01:31:06.837 --> 01:31:08.212
I don't want to talk now.
I'm at the ball game.

01:31:08.296 --> 01:31:09.839
Chris!
[Beeps Off]

01:31:09.965 --> 01:31:11.048
Damn it!

01:31:12.968 --> 01:31:14.176
[Sheri]
Ben, come on.

01:31:14.261 --> 01:31:15.678
Don't do it.
This is crazy.

01:31:15.762 --> 01:31:17.680
Think about it, Ben.

01:31:17.764 --> 01:31:19.682
Check's all made out.

01:31:19.766 --> 01:31:22.393
I'll invite you to
some of the games.

01:31:30.277 --> 01:31:32.278
I'm sorry, Uncle Carl.

01:31:33.697 --> 01:31:36.991
[Pen Scribbling]
Another idiot.

01:31:41.788 --> 01:31:44.415
And when you think
it's all over

01:31:44.499 --> 01:31:46.792
[Groans]

01:31:46.877 --> 01:31:51.338
It's not over

01:31:51.423 --> 01:31:54.008
When you think it's all over

01:31:54.092 --> 01:31:55.551
It's not over

01:31:55.635 --> 01:31:57.428
[Crowd Cheering]

01:31:57.512 --> 01:31:59.054
