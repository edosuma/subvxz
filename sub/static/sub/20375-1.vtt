but she positively refuses
to go to sleep

50:31.319 --> 50:32.903
till she's seen you.

50:33.030 --> 50:35.031
- Fisher.

51:03.852 --> 51:06.645
- Hello.

51:06.772 --> 51:08.230
How are you,
Miss Addie?

51:08.356 --> 51:12.234
- Thank you for coming in.

51:12.360 --> 51:14.153
I know how unpleasant it is

51:14.279 --> 51:17.448
to enter
this chamber of horrors.

51:18.450 --> 51:19.825
[Door slams]

51:19.951 --> 51:21.535
[lock clicks]

51:21.661 --> 51:25.081
- Why do you call it a chamber
of horrors, Miss Addie?

51:25.207 --> 51:27.500
- 'Cause that's
just what it is.

51:27.626 --> 51:29.460
Would you please
close this door?

51:31.379 --> 51:34.298
Would you please lock it?

51:34.424 --> 51:38.135
I want to have a completely
private talk with you.

51:38.261 --> 51:39.553
[Lock clicks]

51:39.679 --> 51:41.180
Now come over here

51:41.306 --> 51:43.557
so I don't have
to raise my voice.

51:43.683 --> 51:47.269
I have the use of my voice.

51:47.395 --> 51:50.564
My heart and my lungs
and the other internal organs

51:50.690 --> 51:53.651
that one can't control

51:53.777 --> 51:56.946
remorselessly continue.

51:57.072 --> 52:00.741
As for the rest of me,

52:00.867 --> 52:03.786
it's stone dead, Fisher.

52:05.372 --> 52:08.707
Are you in a hurry
to get back down to the party?

52:10.877 --> 52:12.545
- No.

52:17.050 --> 52:19.844
- We met only once before.

52:19.970 --> 52:23.472
Your Aunt Cornelia and I
had had a brief

52:23.598 --> 52:29.145
but memorable encounter
in Hong Kong.

52:29.271 --> 52:31.981
Two years ago when I was here
for a short visit,

52:32.107 --> 52:35.568
she brought you along
when she paid me a call at my--

52:35.694 --> 52:37.111
- Of course, I remember.

52:37.237 --> 52:38.320
You had a little--

52:38.446 --> 52:41.198
- Yeah, cottage
on Sand Island.

52:41.324 --> 52:43.993
- She said
you wrote travel books.

52:44.119 --> 52:48.122
- My base was Hong Kong.

52:48.248 --> 52:52.459
There's much tolerance there.

52:52.586 --> 52:54.795
And here?

52:54.921 --> 52:56.463
- I would say none at all.

52:56.590 --> 52:58.299
- Yes.

52:58.425 --> 53:03.929
So I elected to spend my life
in the tolerant Orient.

53:04.055 --> 53:05.806
But things that one elects

53:05.932 --> 53:09.351
are often circumvented
by others.

53:09.477 --> 53:11.478
I think you know about that.

53:11.605 --> 53:12.855
- [Scoffs]

53:12.981 --> 53:14.481
Yes.

53:14.608 --> 53:16.609
I know about that.

53:16.735 --> 53:18.694
- I had a stroke in China.

53:18.820 --> 53:20.654
It was a slight one,

53:20.780 --> 53:24.783
but I knew--I was told--
there'd be others.

53:24.910 --> 53:25.993
And unfortunately...

53:26.119 --> 53:27.786
- [distantly]
Fisher?

53:27.913 --> 53:30.497
- Oh, you're being called
back downstairs.

53:30.624 --> 53:35.502
I have to get on
with this quickly.

53:35.629 --> 53:37.630
I had to stay in China

53:37.756 --> 53:38.964
because I'd become addicted

53:39.090 --> 53:41.425
to something
that I could only have there.

53:41.551 --> 53:43.427
- What to?
To what, Miss Addie?

53:43.553 --> 53:45.846
- To a drug

53:45.972 --> 53:48.182
that made it bearable
for me to live

53:48.308 --> 53:53.020
when living
became unbearable for me.

53:53.146 --> 53:56.357
You see,
I'd quit my travels

53:56.483 --> 54:00.027
and settled down
in one place

54:00.153 --> 54:04.406
and, needing something so badly
to make life bearable,

54:04.532 --> 54:07.660
I found something:

54:07.786 --> 54:10.287
the poppy,

54:10.413 --> 54:15.167
the smoke
of the burning poppy.

54:15.293 --> 54:20.381
And then early last summer,

54:20.507 --> 54:23.676
the terrible thing
that was coming,

54:23.802 --> 54:27.596
that the drug made me forget
was coming,

54:27.722 --> 54:31.100
happened.

54:31.226 --> 54:37.189
I had the strokes that caused
my present condition.

54:37.315 --> 54:38.899
My brother Jack was told,

54:39.025 --> 54:42.945
and I was brought back here
by force,

54:43.071 --> 54:47.491
as I am kept living in agony
by force.

54:50.370 --> 54:53.956
And then I was...

54:54.082 --> 54:58.043
withdrawn from my...

54:58.169 --> 55:01.922
my comfort.

55:02.048 --> 55:06.176
- Miss Addie, why are you
telling me this story?

55:06.303 --> 55:09.221
- Because I remember
the last time I saw you,

55:09.347 --> 55:11.432
the impression you made on me.

55:11.558 --> 55:18.230
There was something
hard and honest about you.

55:18.356 --> 55:21.942
I thought you could
do something for me,

55:22.068 --> 55:25.696
the only thing that can
be done for me now.

55:25.822 --> 55:28.824
You see, I see nobody
but people that can't imagine.

55:28.950 --> 55:30.617
You can.

55:30.744 --> 55:35.956
You can imagine, Fisher.

55:36.082 --> 55:41.378
Oh, they give me something,
but it's not enough.

55:41.504 --> 55:45.549
You see that bottle
over there on the mantel?

55:45.675 --> 55:48.594
You could get it for me,

55:48.720 --> 55:52.473
and I could resume
my travels.

56:04.694 --> 56:07.446
Do you know what I mean?

56:07.572 --> 56:10.991
Have I made myself
perfectly clear?

56:11.117 --> 56:16.288
Nobody could possibly guess
that you gave it to me.

56:16.414 --> 56:20.376
They'd think I just had
my last stroke...

56:20.502 --> 56:22.795
in my sleep.

56:40.772 --> 56:42.856
- How many?

56:42.982 --> 56:46.568
- All.

56:46.694 --> 56:49.113
All.

57:01.042 --> 57:03.127
[Bottle clinking]

57:09.634 --> 57:11.176
[knock at door]

57:11.302 --> 57:12.678
Well, that's not all,
Fisher.

57:12.804 --> 57:13.679
[Door rattles]

57:13.805 --> 57:14.930
- Fisher, open this door.

57:15.056 --> 57:16.265
- I'll come back later.

57:16.391 --> 57:18.183
- You promise?

57:18.309 --> 57:20.644
- Swear on my word of honor.

57:23.273 --> 57:25.524
- Fisher.

57:25.650 --> 57:27.609
- I'll come back up
for this other diamond earring

57:27.735 --> 57:30.737
and my leopard-skin coat.

57:36.494 --> 57:41.039
- Fisher, Jimmy was searched
to the skin before witnesses,

57:41.166 --> 57:42.624
and all he had on him

57:42.750 --> 57:44.585
was three sticks
of peppermint gum,

57:44.711 --> 57:48.797
a few cigarettes,
$3.47,

57:48.923 --> 57:50.883
and...

57:51.009 --> 57:52.926
- "And"?
And what?

57:53.052 --> 57:56.430
- And something
in a small unopened package

57:56.556 --> 57:58.015
almost completely flat

57:58.141 --> 57:59.433
and the keys
to your car.

57:59.559 --> 58:01.393
- What is this all about?

58:01.519 --> 58:03.645
- It's all about
Fisher Willow's attempt

58:03.771 --> 58:06.940
to buy an escort for her
debut parties in Memphis,

58:07.066 --> 58:08.650
provide him with clothes,

58:08.776 --> 58:11.361
and now accuse him
of stealing a diamond from her.

58:11.488 --> 58:12.488
Why?

58:12.614 --> 58:14.323
Not easy to guess.

58:14.449 --> 58:17.701
- Oh, have you guessed,
Miss McCorkle?

58:17.827 --> 58:19.453
What have you guessed?

58:19.579 --> 58:23.290
- He hasn't responded to your
courtship as you'd expected.

58:23.416 --> 58:25.250
- I must be getting drowsy.

58:25.376 --> 58:27.586
I don't understand
all of this.

58:27.712 --> 58:31.882
Julie, take your
loud-voiced cousin out of here,

58:32.008 --> 58:32.966
would you, please,

58:33.092 --> 58:37.221
so I can finish my talk
with Fisher?

58:37.347 --> 58:41.141
You know excitement
is not allowed in sickrooms.

58:42.602 --> 58:44.561
- Fisher, you will say

58:44.687 --> 58:47.147
that the earring
fell down your dress.

58:47.273 --> 58:50.943
- I will say whatever I can
without lying.

58:51.069 --> 58:52.819
I'm not a liar, Julie.

58:52.946 --> 58:54.363
- [Scoffs]

58:54.489 --> 58:56.114
- Julie, will you
please take yourself

58:56.241 --> 58:58.450
and this other girl
out of here?

59:00.495 --> 59:01.828
- [Sighs]

59:01.955 --> 59:04.164
Good night, Miss Addie.

59:07.168 --> 59:08.877
- You know, I really did lose
the other one

59:09.003 --> 59:11.046
of this pair
of teardrop diamonds.

59:11.172 --> 59:14.049
- Well, I know you lost it,
Fisher,

59:14.175 --> 59:16.593
but you have handled
the situation

59:16.719 --> 59:19.263
in a terrible way.

59:19.389 --> 59:20.847
You must have done it
in a way

59:20.974 --> 59:22.516
that made that boy
feel like you

59:22.642 --> 59:24.935
were accusing him
of stealing it.

59:25.061 --> 59:27.271
- How could he think
such a thing?

59:27.397 --> 59:28.814
He's been acting so peculiar

59:28.940 --> 59:30.774
ever since we left
the levee tonight.

59:30.900 --> 59:33.402
I asked him to drive me up
on the levee

59:33.528 --> 59:35.779
to see the mist
rising off the river.

59:35.905 --> 59:37.990
Because I love to see
the river mist rising,

59:38.116 --> 59:39.491
because I like nothing better.

59:39.617 --> 59:41.451
Nothing's more beautiful
to me.

59:41.578 --> 59:43.370
[Sighs]

59:43.496 --> 59:48.417
Of course, that's peculiar
of me too, I suppose.

59:48.543 --> 59:52.212
- What happened
on the levee?

59:52.338 --> 59:54.172
- Nothing at all,

59:54.299 --> 59:57.175
to speak of.

59:57.302 --> 59:59.469
We stopped there awhile.

59:59.596 --> 01:00:03.807
I laid my head
on his shoulder for a moment.

01:00:03.933 --> 01:00:06.018
- He didn't kiss you

01:00:06.144 --> 01:00:12.274
when you parked on the levee
to see the river mist rising?

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:14.234
- Now, Miss Addie.

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:16.820
Do you suppose I have
to beg for kisses?

01:00:16.946 --> 01:00:18.780
- Of course you're attractive.

01:00:18.906 --> 01:00:21.700
That's not the issue, is it?

01:00:21.826 --> 01:00:24.077
[Owl hooting]

01:00:24.203 --> 01:00:27.456
- Hear that?

01:00:27.582 --> 01:00:28.582
[Owl hooting]

01:00:34.547 --> 01:00:39.009
I've made up my mind
about something.

01:00:39.135 --> 01:00:42.929
I won't go back to Memphis

01:00:43.056 --> 01:00:45.265
to continue
this ridiculous pretense

01:00:45.391 --> 01:00:47.726
of being interested
in the society of that city

01:00:47.852 --> 01:00:51.229
when it bores me to blazes.

01:00:51.356 --> 01:00:55.233
I'm gonna catch the very next
boat back to Europe.

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:57.778
And I think
that Aunt Cornelia

01:00:57.904 --> 01:01:03.116
will be glad to see me set sail
from these shores.

01:01:03.242 --> 01:01:06.995
I disgraced her in Memphis.

01:01:07.121 --> 01:01:08.955
Oh, well.

01:01:09.082 --> 01:01:12.209
I'm out of my element here.

01:01:12.335 --> 01:01:15.170
Yes.

01:01:15.296 --> 01:01:20.425
I'm gonna catch the very next
boat back to Europe

01:01:20.551 --> 01:01:25.347
and take an apartment
on the Rive Gauche in Paris

01:01:25.473 --> 01:01:28.308
and establish a salon...

01:01:28.434 --> 01:01:30.310
[laughs]
Like Gertrude Stein's.

01:01:30.436 --> 01:01:33.230
[Laughs]

01:01:33.356 --> 01:01:35.565
I'll commission Pablo Picasso

01:01:35.692 --> 01:01:39.820
to do a portrait of me
all in blue.

01:01:43.825 --> 01:01:46.910
I'm not gonna lose my mind,

01:01:47.036 --> 01:01:49.955
not crack up again.

01:01:50.081 --> 01:01:55.502
I'm going to develop
my interest in the arts.

01:01:55.628 --> 01:02:00.674
I must be with people
who do things,

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:05.053
paint, write,

01:02:05.179 --> 01:02:10.684
compose music,
and so forth.

01:02:13.312 --> 01:02:17.691
- Well, you do have character.

01:02:17.817 --> 01:02:20.610
Maybe even talent.

01:02:20.737 --> 01:02:23.697
But I do shudder for you.

01:02:23.823 --> 01:02:25.949
- Why do you shudder for me?

01:02:26.075 --> 01:02:31.037
- Because you want somebody
to love you that you love,

01:02:31.164 --> 01:02:35.709
and you don't know
how to arrange that.

01:02:35.835 --> 01:02:39.588
And not all the teardrop
diamonds of this world,

01:02:39.714 --> 01:02:42.424
lost or found,

01:02:42.550 --> 01:02:45.510
can arrange that for you.

01:02:45.636 --> 01:02:50.724
Now, you go on back downstairs
and make an announcement.

01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:55.145
You say that the teardrop
diamond has been found.

01:02:55.271 --> 01:02:58.315
- Why should I
discard my honesty,

01:02:58.441 --> 01:03:00.025
all that I've got, really?

01:03:00.151 --> 01:03:01.985
- Oh, nonsense.

01:03:02.111 --> 01:03:06.198
Strong people with character
like you, Fisher Willow,

01:03:06.324 --> 01:03:10.368
don't care about losing
a teardrop diamond.

01:03:10.495 --> 01:03:14.080
They have
more important problems.

01:03:17.335 --> 01:03:19.669
Now, go.

01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:27.427
Just remember your promise
to come back.

01:03:27.553 --> 01:03:29.221
- Yes.

01:03:29.347 --> 01:03:32.682
Soon, Miss Addie.

01:03:42.944 --> 01:03:45.445
[Laughter]

01:03:45.571 --> 01:03:47.989
- Are you gonna make
the announcement?

01:03:48.115 --> 01:03:50.450
- You will make
the announcement.

01:03:50.576 --> 01:03:53.328
I will not contradict it.

01:03:53.454 --> 01:03:55.705
- Are your slippers dry now,
Fisher?

01:03:55.832 --> 01:03:58.250
- Uh, yes,
uh, sufficiently, thank you.

01:03:58.376 --> 01:03:59.501
- Hey, everybody.

01:03:59.627 --> 01:04:01.086
Listen.

01:04:01.212 --> 01:04:02.462
Isn't it wonderful?

01:04:02.588 --> 01:04:04.339
