09:15.333 --> 09:17.208
Your driver's name is Amjad.

09:17.208 --> 09:19.709
- What?
- Amjad.

09:19.709 --> 09:20.917
- Amjad?
- Amjad.

09:20.917 --> 09:24.208
- That's a person?
- He'll be there in six minutes.

09:24.208 --> 09:25.917
- How do you know?
- It's on my phone.

09:25.917 --> 09:28.458
- I'm on your phone.
- I have another phone.

09:28.458 --> 09:30.000
Who has two phones?

09:30.000 --> 09:31.583
No, I--
don't--

09:31.583 --> 09:34.500
The point is
your Uber driver, Amjad--

09:34.500 --> 09:35.667
Ubah.
Amjad.

09:35.667 --> 09:36.959
[Linda] Just put Matt on.

09:36.959 --> 09:38.458
Just put him back on!

09:38.458 --> 09:39.333
Hang on.

09:41.417 --> 09:42.750
All right, I found the body.

09:42.750 --> 09:45.583
Now I got to get a funeral
home to go pick it up.

09:45.583 --> 09:47.166
She's insisting
on speaking to you.

09:47.166 --> 09:48.834
She doesn't seem
to understand Uber,

09:48.834 --> 09:50.458
and she has issues
with her driver Amjad.

09:50.458 --> 09:52.250
She's clearly distraught.

09:52.250 --> 09:54.458
Let me handle it.

09:54.458 --> 09:55.083
Linda.

09:55.083 --> 09:56.917
Take the fucking Uber.

09:56.917 --> 09:56.959
Done.

10:01.083 --> 10:02.125
I'm so sorry.

10:02.125 --> 10:03.750
Yeah, she's a pain in the ass.

10:03.750 --> 10:05.208
No, about your father.

10:05.208 --> 10:08.291
Oh.
That.

10:08.291 --> 10:08.834
Well, what're you gonna do?

10:10.959 --> 10:15.709
So, we'll get out of your hair
and let you deal with this.

10:15.709 --> 10:18.000
No, no, no. Stay.
I just need, like, a second.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.583
Then we can get back to work.

10:20.500 --> 10:22.583
[Assistant] Matt LeBlanc on one.

10:22.583 --> 10:23.709
Hey, bud.
What's up?

10:23.709 --> 10:24.750
[Matt] Hey, uh...

10:24.750 --> 10:26.500
My father just died.

10:26.500 --> 10:29.250
- Aw, no.
- Dropped dead at Target.

10:29.250 --> 10:31.792
Oh! Jesus, that is sad
on so many levels.

10:31.792 --> 10:32.875
[Matt] So I, uh,

10:32.875 --> 10:35.125
I need a funeral home to go and
pick up the body.

10:35.125 --> 10:36.750
- Can you--
- [Roger] I'm on it.

10:36.750 --> 10:37.959
Text me the info,
and if there's

10:37.959 --> 10:39.125
anything else I can--

10:39.125 --> 10:40.750
Yeah, get me a Marvel franchise.

10:40.750 --> 10:42.208
[laughs]
One thing at a time.

10:42.208 --> 10:44.208
[scoffs]

10:44.208 --> 10:46.458
Okay, where were we?

10:46.458 --> 10:48.792
Are you sure
you're up for this?

10:48.792 --> 10:50.250
Sure, yeah, why not?

10:50.250 --> 10:52.959
Well, I'm sorry,
but you just lost your father.

10:52.959 --> 10:55.750
You must be feeling...
something.

10:55.750 --> 10:56.375
I feel stuff.

10:56.375 --> 10:58.583
I feel annoyed...

10:58.583 --> 11:00.750
that I have to
handle this shit.

11:00.750 --> 11:02.125
I feel relieved...

11:02.125 --> 11:03.959
that stupid Linda's
off the phone.

11:03.959 --> 11:05.625
I feel angry...

11:05.625 --> 11:05.834
at Netflix.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.375
And I'm also
a little hungry.

11:09.375 --> 11:10.000
Probably all that
mayonnaise talk.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.667
Anyone want a sandwich?

11:11.667 --> 11:14.000
You're not really eating
mayonnaise now?

11:14.000 --> 11:16.166
Yep.

11:16.166 --> 11:19.125
I'm gonna look death
in the face...

11:19.125 --> 11:21.125
and then I'm gonna
spread it on whole wheat

11:21.125 --> 11:21.625
with some turkey and Swiss.

11:21.625 --> 11:24.083
[keys clacking]

11:24.083 --> 11:26.166
I've got to say,
so far today,

11:26.166 --> 11:27.417
this is the best
idea you've had.

11:27.417 --> 11:30.291
It's the mayonnaise.

11:32.667 --> 11:33.959
Let's say

11:33.959 --> 11:36.500
you could turn on
your TV right now

11:36.500 --> 11:37.959
and watch anything
you wanted.

11:37.959 --> 11:39.500
What would it be?

11:39.500 --> 11:40.375
- And it can't be Whores.
- Oh.

11:40.375 --> 11:43.250
Anything at all.

11:45.834 --> 11:48.667
- Hmm.
- What?

11:48.667 --> 11:50.375
I should probably
call my mother.

11:50.375 --> 11:51.750
Really? Now?
When we're on a roll?

11:51.750 --> 11:54.583
Yeah, well,
I should let her know.

11:54.583 --> 11:56.208
Technically,
they're still married.

11:56.208 --> 11:57.583
- You're joking.
- Nope.

11:57.583 --> 11:59.375
40 years she wouldn't
give him a divorce.

11:59.375 --> 12:02.750
She was all about
"till death do us part."

12:02.750 --> 12:03.542
So today's quite the payoff.

12:03.542 --> 12:07.041
Just two seconds.
Keep going.

12:07.041 --> 12:09.917
[phone ringing]

12:14.709 --> 12:16.417
- Hello?
- Ma?

12:16.417 --> 12:17.291
- Hello?
- Ma?

12:17.291 --> 12:19.208
- Hello?
- Ma.

12:19.208 --> 12:20.375
Put your hearing aids in.

12:20.375 --> 12:21.333
Put your hearing aids in.

12:21.333 --> 12:25.166
Hold on, I'm putting
my hearing aids in.

12:26.792 --> 12:27.834
[feedback whines]

12:27.834 --> 12:28.625
Hello?

12:28.625 --> 12:29.917
Ma.
Feedback.

12:29.917 --> 12:31.250
[Mrs. LeBlanc] Hold on.

12:31.250 --> 12:31.875
I can't hear.

12:31.875 --> 12:34.000
[Matt] Feedback. Ma?

12:34.000 --> 12:35.750
I hate these damn things.

12:35.750 --> 12:37.333
[Matt] Ma?

12:39.333 --> 12:41.458
- Hello?
- Can you hear me now?

12:41.458 --> 12:43.041
- Hello?
- Ma?

12:43.041 --> 12:45.834
- I took it out.
- Put it back.

12:48.250 --> 12:50.583
[feedback whining]

12:50.583 --> 12:51.750
Hold on.

12:51.750 --> 12:53.834
Jesus Christ.
Adjust it.

12:53.834 --> 12:53.959
Adjust it!

12:56.917 --> 12:59.667
- Better?
- Yeah. Yeah, better.

12:59.667 --> 13:00.500
Huh.

13:00.500 --> 13:02.375
So, what's new?

13:02.375 --> 13:03.959
Dad's dead.

13:06.583 --> 13:08.250
- [Mrs. LeBlanc] What?
- [Matt] He's dead.

13:08.250 --> 13:09.500
What?

13:09.500 --> 13:10.542
- [Matt] Dead.

13:10.542 --> 13:12.166
[Sean] He's so shut down.

13:12.166 --> 13:14.458
You're assuming there's
something there to shut.

13:14.458 --> 13:15.500
You saw what they
were like together.

13:15.500 --> 13:16.792
[indistinct conversation]

13:16.792 --> 13:18.333
No, I know,
but it's his father.

13:18.333 --> 13:20.417
[phone ringing]

13:20.417 --> 13:21.000
- Linda.
- Fuck.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.959
I can't do it.
I can't.

13:22.959 --> 13:26.458
- I was last up.
- Oohh. [frustrated exhale]

13:26.458 --> 13:27.959
Fine, fine, fine, fine.

13:27.959 --> 13:30.166
Argh!
Hello.

13:30.166 --> 13:31.875
What's-his-name's
still not here yet.

13:31.875 --> 13:35.417
Hang on.
That's Sean's department.

13:36.458 --> 13:37.625
Hello, Linda.

13:37.625 --> 13:39.250
[Linda] He's still not here.

13:39.250 --> 13:41.959
- Hang on, let me check.
- I'm starting to melt.

13:41.959 --> 13:43.667
- It says he should be there.
- Well, tell it he's not.

13:43.667 --> 13:45.500
- He's in a Kia.
- IKEA?

13:45.500 --> 13:47.834
I told you Target!

13:47.834 --> 13:51.750
- Target!
- He's in a Kia.

13:51.750 --> 13:53.500
- A what?
- A Kia.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.000
- A Kia?
- A Kia.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.083
A Kia?

13:57.083 --> 13:57.583
Hang on.
Let me call him.

13:57.583 --> 13:59.166
Here's Beverly.

14:01.000 --> 14:01.375
Hello again.

14:01.375 --> 14:04.333
Ugh.

14:04.333 --> 14:06.083
Hello, Amjad?

14:06.083 --> 14:08.792
What type of Kia is it?

14:08.792 --> 14:10.959
It's a white Kia Rio.

14:10.959 --> 14:12.792
It's a white Kia Rio.

14:12.792 --> 14:15.250
- A Kiario?
- No.

14:15.250 --> 14:19.333
The model of the Kia is a Rio,

14:19.333 --> 14:20.750
and the color is white.

14:20.750 --> 14:23.500
Do you see a white car?

14:23.500 --> 14:24.709
Yeah.

14:24.709 --> 14:26.250
I'm standing
right next to one.

14:26.250 --> 14:27.083
Wave to her.

14:28.917 --> 14:30.333
That's a Kia Rio?

14:30.333 --> 14:32.000
Yes, that's a Kia Rio,

14:32.000 --> 14:33.875
- and the gentleman--
- [Linda] Oh, Jesus.

14:33.875 --> 14:34.834
I have no key.

14:34.834 --> 14:36.542
He had the keys in his pocket.

14:36.542 --> 14:37.792
I can't get into the house.

14:37.792 --> 14:40.166
I'm not sure what to tell you.

14:40.166 --> 14:41.959
God damn it.
Tell Matt I'm locked out.

14:41.959 --> 14:43.792
I need his key.

14:43.792 --> 14:45.041
I'm afraid he's on
with his mother.

14:45.041 --> 14:47.834
- Is she locked out?
- I don't think so.

14:47.834 --> 14:50.750
Then fuck her.
Just put him on.

14:50.750 --> 14:52.542
Hang on.

14:52.542 --> 14:53.542
[Matt] I just wanted you
to know.

14:53.542 --> 14:55.041
- [Linda] I don't know.
- I'm so sorry.

14:55.041 --> 14:56.375
It's, uh, Linda.

14:56.375 --> 14:57.500
[Linda speaks
indistinctly on phone]

14:57.500 --> 14:58.917
She says she's locked out
and she needs your key.

14:58.917 --> 15:00.291
I don't have a key.

15:00.291 --> 15:01.208
[Linda]
How do you not have a key?

15:01.208 --> 15:02.750
How do you not have a key?

15:02.750 --> 15:04.500
- You live there.
- Would you like the phone?

15:04.500 --> 15:06.166
No, call in a fucking locksmith.

15:06.166 --> 15:07.625
Absolutely.

15:07.625 --> 15:08.875
It only gets better.

15:08.875 --> 15:11.083
[Mrs. LeBlanc]
Get who a locksmith?

15:11.083 --> 15:11.375
Linda.

15:11.375 --> 15:12.375
Who?

15:12.375 --> 15:14.917
Linda.

15:14.917 --> 15:16.750
I don't believe I know
anyone by that name.

15:16.750 --> 15:18.166
All right, Ma.

15:18.166 --> 15:19.750
Ooh, that whore.

15:19.750 --> 15:22.083
Anyway, that's the news.

15:22.083 --> 15:23.333
[Mrs. LeBlanc]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait,

15:23.333 --> 15:24.542
how's he getting back here?

15:24.542 --> 15:25.250
- Who?
- Your father, who.

15:25.250 --> 15:26.834
- For what?
- His funeral.

15:26.834 --> 15:29.834
- What funeral?
- "What funeral?"

15:29.834 --> 15:33.041
After everything
that asshole did?

15:33.041 --> 15:34.583
He's still my husband.

15:34.583 --> 15:37.000
I get to put him in the ground.

15:37.917 --> 15:39.417
Fine, I'll...

15:39.417 --> 15:41.917
I'll figure out a way
to ship him back.

15:41.917 --> 15:42.834
Good.

15:42.834 --> 15:44.417
Now, I got to go to Costco.

15:44.417 --> 15:45.250
- What should I get you?
- For what?

15:45.250 --> 15:47.375
Well, you're
coming in for this.

15:47.375 --> 15:48.834
- No, I'm not.
- He's your father.

15:48.834 --> 15:50.625
How's it gonna look?

15:50.625 --> 15:53.417
How'd it look 40 years ago
when he walked out on us?

15:53.417 --> 15:54.542
Oh, let it go, Matthew.

15:54.542 --> 15:56.583
He's dead.

15:56.583 --> 15:58.291
He's with God.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.333
I doubt that.

16:00.333 --> 16:01.417
[Merc] Hello?

16:01.417 --> 16:03.750
- In here!
- Hey, babe.

16:03.750 --> 16:08.125
So, I've got some big news.

16:08.125 --> 16:09.291
Big big?

16:09.291 --> 16:11.083
Oh, pretty darn big.

16:11.083 --> 16:12.417
Hmm.
Intriguing.

16:12.417 --> 16:16.792
Guess who's engaged
to Morning Randolph?

16:20.208 --> 16:21.792
- What?
- [laughs]

16:21.792 --> 16:23.959
Obviously, no one told you,

16:23.959 --> 16:25.959
or you would've said
something to me.

16:25.959 --> 16:29.291
But I guess--
congratulations!

16:29.291 --> 16:30.250
[both laugh]

16:30.250 --> 16:32.458
Okay, that  is crazy.

16:32.458 --> 16:34.792
Seriously loony tunes crazy.

16:34.792 --> 16:36.625
Just tellin' you what I heard.

16:36.625 --> 16:38.000
- From who?
- Not important.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.125
That I am engaged
to Morning Randolph?

16:40.125 --> 16:43.291
This person was pretty sure.
She saw a ring.

16:43.291 --> 16:44.834
A ring?
Jesus.

16:44.834 --> 16:46.792
I don't even know
what to do with that.

16:46.792 --> 16:47.834
Either someone is
fucking with you,

16:47.834 --> 16:51.041
or they're just nuts.

16:51.041 --> 16:52.041
Look, I totally get
why you'd flip out.

16:52.041 --> 16:55.208
But I swear,
it is not true.

16:55.208 --> 16:58.834
I swear on the lives
of my children.

16:58.834 --> 17:01.000
First of all, engaged?

17:01.000 --> 17:02.208
Me?

17:02.208 --> 17:04.458
I'm still paying off
the first three.

17:04.458 --> 17:07.125
And if I was ever
gonna do it again,

17:07.125 --> 17:09.125
you know...
you know...

17:09.125 --> 17:10.667
I love you.

17:10.667 --> 17:14.500
And Morning Randolph?
Are you kidding me?

17:14.500 --> 17:18.000
She's been around since,
like, Truman was president.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.375
Seriously, I think
