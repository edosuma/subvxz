WEBVTT

00:02.788 --> 00:04.911
You organise an extra delivery.

00:04.917 --> 00:06.813
Yeah and wave a big red flag.

00:07.992 --> 00:09.609
Where's the fucking gear?!

00:09.615 --> 00:11.398
WILL: Some arsehole tipped 'em off.

00:11.404 --> 00:13.593
Mercado was there waiting
to pick up the delivery.

00:13.599 --> 00:15.691
There is definitely a dodgy officer.

00:15.697 --> 00:17.083
We might have a problem.

00:17.089 --> 00:18.820
Jackson, I think he's suss.

00:18.826 --> 00:21.072
What the hell are the CSDS doing here?

00:21.673 --> 00:23.365
MILES: It's a waste of time and money.

00:23.893 --> 00:25.455
WILL: You set me up, didn't ya?

00:25.461 --> 00:27.885
Tried it once with the
piss test, you motherfucker!

00:27.891 --> 00:29.338
If this Green Wall project kicks off,

00:29.344 --> 00:31.394
they're gonna be sending
shipments out of the prison.

00:31.400 --> 00:33.555
Gonna ask Liz if we can
get into the seedling area.

00:33.736 --> 00:35.252
Well, I guess you were right...

00:35.311 --> 00:37.027
you'll be leaving here in a box.

00:37.153 --> 00:39.748
My name's Iman. I need some legal help.

00:39.754 --> 00:42.176
- So, she was trollin' ya?
- Yeah, definitely.

00:42.182 --> 00:43.462
Jake and I are...

00:43.463 --> 00:45.260
in a relationship.

00:45.551 --> 00:48.751
You are a total liability
and a complete waste of space.

00:48.752 --> 00:50.822
Get out of my workshop!

00:51.002 --> 00:53.627
- Bye, Franky.
- We're not done!

00:55.416 --> 00:56.616
Wait, wait...

00:56.829 --> 00:58.440
I can't, it's too soon.

- Oh fuck!
- I'm sorry, you okay?

03:13.142 --> 03:14.409
What are you doing?

03:14.415 --> 03:17.845
You were right. Stewart's the dirty
officer. He tried to set me up.

03:17.851 --> 03:20.828
Planted drugs in my locker
right before the CSDS raid.

03:23.025 --> 03:24.225
(both exhale)

03:24.548 --> 03:25.876
He's not fuckin' around.

03:25.882 --> 03:27.657
That's why I waited
for him to clock off.

03:27.735 --> 03:29.461
This has to be a total secret.

03:29.634 --> 03:32.546
- So, tell the Governor.
- There's no point without proof.

03:32.552 --> 03:34.643
And she thinks he's
a fucking golden boy.

03:34.649 --> 03:35.849
You've got the drugs from the locker,

03:35.855 --> 03:37.329
- show her those.
- I flushed them.

03:37.335 --> 03:39.780
- (both sigh)
- There might be another way.

03:39.786 --> 03:42.521
I need Novak to tell the Governor
that Stewart gave her ice.

03:42.527 --> 03:45.207
- She's not gonna wanna risk that.
- She will if you ask her to.

03:45.213 --> 03:46.651
I'm not gonna put her
in the firing line.

03:46.657 --> 03:48.670
- Don't ask me to do that.
- So what, all this

03:48.676 --> 03:51.030
"protect the women, stop the
drugs", that's all bullshit is it?

03:51.036 --> 03:52.125
(sighs)

03:52.131 --> 03:54.741
Kaz, to stop the drugs we
have to go to the source.

03:55.830 --> 03:57.307
So, tell the Governor.

03:57.843 --> 03:59.614
She trusts you.

03:59.859 --> 04:01.368
Please do that.

04:02.683 --> 04:04.374
And we'll keep Allie out of this.

04:08.867 --> 04:10.244

BOOMER: I, uh, found a
replacement for Stella, hey.

04:19.439 --> 04:21.685
SONIA: Oh, excellent. Who is it?

04:21.928 --> 04:24.942
- Um, that new chick, Iman.
- Ah-huh!

04:24.948 --> 04:27.800
Cultural diversity in
the workplace, very good.

04:27.806 --> 04:30.653
- Ticking all the boxes.
- Yeah. Yeah. Oh, well,

04:30.659 --> 04:33.139
- long as she's good on the tools, eh?
- (Sonia chuckles)

04:33.235 --> 04:35.960
(drills whirring and hammering)

04:38.874 --> 04:40.074
We all right?

04:41.077 --> 04:42.349
Yeah.

04:42.569 --> 04:43.983
Yeah, forget it.

04:45.061 --> 04:47.761
Think we both had someone else in mind.

04:49.053 --> 04:50.717
We still gonna do this other thing?

04:51.430 --> 04:53.424
Yeah. Why?

04:53.430 --> 04:55.122
Maybe it wasn't fair asking you.

04:55.727 --> 04:56.927
What?!

04:57.811 --> 05:01.085
You can't do a backflip on me now.
I've already packed my suitcase.

05:01.091 --> 05:02.291
It's a massive risk.

05:02.297 --> 05:04.131
If we get caught they'll
slap another six months on.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.809
- I'm not planning on getting caught.
- But everyone does.

05:06.815 --> 05:09.491
We're girt by fuckin' sea.
There's nowhere to run.

05:09.497 --> 05:11.203
Look, if I stay in here...

05:11.619 --> 05:14.920
I'm either gonna kill Ferguson
or I'm gonna kill myself.

05:16.531 --> 05:19.360
Let's be the first ones
to get away for good.

05:19.508 --> 05:21.258
Besides, it give me something to do.

05:21.734 --> 05:23.735
So bloody get on with it you slack tart.

05:23.741 --> 05:25.949
Oi! We're multitasking.

05:25.955 --> 05:27.221
- Oh yeah.
- Yes.

05:27.227 --> 05:28.626
You know, I am so pleased

05:28.632 --> 05:31.385
we've been give this second
chance to prove ourselves...

05:31.391 --> 05:32.778
Golden opportunity.

05:32.784 --> 05:36.492
...and I intend to make certain
we take full advantage of it.

05:36.498 --> 05:39.204
Yeah, see that, that's management
talk for "don't fuck it up".

05:39.492 --> 05:41.730
Well, thank you for the
positive feedback, Boomer...

05:41.736 --> 05:44.628
- Yeah, no worries, Franky.
- Boss lady.

05:44.737 --> 05:46.842
- Bossy lady.
- Oh-ho.

05:47.707 --> 05:50.034
Hey, do ya reckon he ever goes home?

05:50.040 --> 05:52.136
I haven't even seen
him go out for a piss.

05:52.142 --> 05:53.827
It's gonna be a massive problem.

05:55.415 --> 05:57.024
Bet you I could move him.

05:57.095 --> 05:59.538
- Ugh!
- Might give him a heart attack though.

05:59.544 --> 06:01.814
If there's a guard on these
doors after hours we're screwed.

06:01.820 --> 06:04.191
MALE: (via walkie-talkie) Wentworth
Control to Mob Support, come in.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.985
Wentworth Control, Mob Support.

06:05.991 --> 06:07.769
- Check it.
- (walkie-talkie) Transport is en route.

06:07.775 --> 06:09.419
Received. Out.

06:10.744 --> 06:12.879
INMATE: I reckon you're
gettin' better at this.

06:13.025 --> 06:14.445
Roger that.

06:16.252 --> 06:18.363
Right, anything to report on Ferguson?

06:18.369 --> 06:21.118
- No, she's been on her best behaviour.
- Yeah, that's what worries me.

06:21.119 --> 06:23.140
I've been watching her like
a hawk and she knows it.

06:23.146 --> 06:24.720
Right, who's she been talking to?

06:24.896 --> 06:27.096
Well, she doesn't
speak to the women much.

06:27.102 --> 06:28.476
What about the officers,

06:29.172 --> 06:30.761
do any of them talk to her?

06:31.445 --> 06:33.374
Well... (exhales)

06:33.380 --> 06:34.783
I dunno.

06:35.639 --> 06:38.421
Well, you spend most
of the day with her...

06:38.650 --> 06:40.214
Yeah. (Clears throat)

06:40.220 --> 06:43.201
Yeah, so you'd notice if another
officer was getting too close.

06:43.207 --> 06:45.166
Oh, no question, I would but...

06:45.784 --> 06:46.984
(scoffs)

06:46.990 --> 06:51.206
I don't really buy the whole officer
drug dealer thing. Never have.

06:51.212 --> 06:54.017
- You organised a CSDS raid yesterday.
- Yeah... (sighs)

06:54.023 --> 06:56.710
yeah, Will Jackson is
like a dog with a bone.

06:56.716 --> 06:59.210
I thought this would just put
it to bed once and for all.

06:59.216 --> 07:02.319
I've known Will a long time and he
doesn't make accusations lightly,

07:02.325 --> 07:03.928
if he thinks that there's
an officer involved

07:03.934 --> 07:05.514
- then I...
- There's just no evidence for it.

07:05.520 --> 07:08.098
Look, I... I-I dunno
whether it was the...

07:08.104 --> 07:10.545
the brawler accident or what, but

07:10.551 --> 07:12.517
Will have been on edge lately.

07:13.116 --> 07:16.355
Now, he had a real crack at
me yesterday. Got a bit agro.

07:16.634 --> 07:17.922
What about?

07:19.212 --> 07:21.530
(sighs) He's filthy about being demoted.

07:21.536 --> 07:24.722
- There must be more to it than that?
- He blames me for taking his job.

07:24.728 --> 07:27.523
- Did he say that?
- I reckon he's about to pop his cork.

07:31.278 --> 07:32.478
(hushed) Great!

07:32.484 --> 07:34.826
- (child squealing joyfully)
- Tess loves Kinder.

07:35.975 --> 07:39.770
She's got a curious mind.
Much like someone else I know.

07:42.784 --> 07:44.269
I miss her heaps.

07:44.275 --> 07:47.286
Mmm, yeah, well she's
always askin' about ya.

07:47.667 --> 07:49.489
- She misses you too.
- Mmm.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.392
So do I.

07:51.684 --> 07:53.246
She'd love to see ya.

07:53.441 --> 07:57.622
Nuh, don't bring her in. I don't
want her seein' me in this place.

07:57.628 --> 07:59.722
Yeah. Well...

08:00.527 --> 08:03.460
It's not right you're
even in here. (Sighs)

08:03.466 --> 08:05.053
(sighs deeply)

08:05.612 --> 08:08.131
Said you wanted help with something.

08:10.195 --> 08:11.395
What is it?

08:15.466 --> 08:17.997
- Nuh, it's all right.
- Are you sure? I'm happy to help.

08:18.003 --> 08:20.179
Nah, forget it. Here.

08:21.683 --> 08:24.171
- I gotta go.
- Franky, no!

08:24.467 --> 08:27.193
I wasn't there for you when it
counted, I wanna help you now.

08:27.199 --> 08:29.603
- (hushed) It's a huge ask, Dad.
- Hey, come on.

08:29.794 --> 08:31.215
Try me. Come on.

08:33.309 --> 08:34.510
What?

08:35.820 --> 08:37.496
(whispered) I need a walkie-talkie.

08:37.501 --> 08:38.994
Franky, um...

08:39.236 --> 08:42.121
- I'm a plumber. I'm not a spy.
- Yeah, right.

08:42.128 --> 08:43.328
Look, I can give you
some money or something.

08:43.333 --> 08:44.636
- No. I'm sorry.
- Anything. Anything. Anything.

08:44.642 --> 08:46.230
Wasn't even fair to ask ya.

08:46.323 --> 08:48.441
Look, just... all right...

08:49.504 --> 08:50.759
What d'you got in mind?

08:50.765 --> 08:51.997
(knock then door opens)

08:52.003 --> 08:54.058
- Governor?
- Come in.

08:54.064 --> 08:56.758
- (door closes)
- I know who it is. (Sighs)

08:57.033 --> 08:59.256
- (sighs)
- The officer we've been looking for.

09:00.093 --> 09:01.541
Will...

09:01.932 --> 09:04.833
is it at all possible that
you're obsessing over this?

09:04.839 --> 09:06.524
- It's Jake Stewart.
- (sighs quietly)

09:07.364 --> 09:10.530
Well, I didn't believe it at first
either, but it makes perfect sense.

09:13.434 --> 09:15.334
Uh, it makes no sense at all.

09:15.340 --> 09:18.400
He organised the CSDS search
yesterday. Was that to catch himself?

09:18.406 --> 09:20.583
- No, to throw us off.
- Yeah, normally I would

09:20.589 --> 09:23.310
trust your judgement on these
things, but this is patently absurd.

09:23.316 --> 09:25.238
That's why he's always a step ahead,

09:25.398 --> 09:26.879
because he's Deputy Governor.

09:26.885 --> 09:28.557
Is that what's behind all this,

09:28.563 --> 09:31.070
you're jealous about
him taking your job?

09:31.076 --> 09:34.160
- What, are you serious?
- Yeah, well that's what it sounds like.

09:34.166 --> 09:35.791
- Why are you defending him?
- Because...

09:37.172 --> 09:38.372
because...

09:40.433 --> 09:43.665
Okay, this kind of
allegation ends careers,

09:43.671 --> 09:46.910
and so far you haven't
offered a shred of evidence.

09:48.662 --> 09:50.379
What if I bring you a witness?

09:51.554 --> 09:53.354
- Who?
- One of the women.

09:53.436 --> 09:56.860
(scoffs) So, the word of a prisoner
against a respected officer.

09:57.136 --> 09:59.293
Just hear what she has to say.

10:00.077 --> 10:01.404
What've you got to lose?

10:03.247 --> 10:04.713
(whispered) Hey. Hey!

10:06.536 --> 10:07.946
Ah, how's your dad?

10:07.952 --> 10:11.119
Yeah, good. That thing
we need, he's gonna help.

10:11.208 --> 10:13.415
Fuckin' yes! Go Mr D.

10:13.421 --> 10:16.433
The only thing we need now is a
plan of the prison sewerage system.

10:16.439 --> 10:18.557
- (scoffs) Oh, is that all?
- Yeah.

10:18.563 --> 10:20.026
Um, I'm gonna go meet Iman now.

10:20.032 --> 10:21.642
- We'll talk about it later.
- Okay.

10:26.645 --> 10:29.645
(music with drum beats)

10:38.864 --> 10:40.064
(sighs)

10:40.070 --> 10:41.390
- (zinging flourish)
- (music ends)

10:41.396 --> 10:43.805
My lawyer says I'm pretty much stuffed.

10:43.957 --> 10:45.558
Well, you gave 'em my notes?

10:45.564 --> 10:47.711
Yeah, he says there's nothing in it.

10:47.717 --> 10:51.188
Ugh! Yeah or maybe he
just can't be arsed.

10:51.194 --> 10:53.395
Look, just 'cause he's rolled
over doesn't mean you have to.

10:53.401 --> 10:55.595
Do you have copies of the abusive posts?

10:56.301 --> 10:58.381
Okay, well there's no internet
access here so you're gonna have to

10:58.387 --> 11:00.986
ask someone in your family to
print them out and bring 'em in.

11:01.972 --> 11:03.575
That's not gonna happen.

11:04.298 --> 11:06.789
It's kind of important,
could keep ya out of jail.

11:06.795 --> 11:07.995
No.

11:08.656 --> 11:11.414
- Well, I can ask for you if you want?
- I said no, okay?

11:11.633 --> 11:14.350
- Well, there's gotta be someone...
- There is no one!

11:14.356 --> 11:17.549
Okay? My family is dead.
My friends are dead.

11:17.555 --> 11:19.977
They're all fuckin'
dead! Stop trying to help.

11:21.979 --> 11:23.270
Birdsworth here?

11:23.454 --> 11:25.552
- LIZ: Yeah.
- MILES: You got a visitor.

11:25.558 --> 11:28.058
- Who is it?
- Do I look like your PA?

11:28.064 --> 11:29.722
Some detective they said.

11:34.729 --> 11:36.534
(gate beeps unlocked)

11:36.591 --> 11:38.596
(magpie cawing)

11:38.602 --> 11:40.134
(gate banging)

11:40.294 --> 11:41.748
(train horn sounds in distance)

11:41.754 --> 11:44.505
(train crossing bells
ringing in distance)

11:44.511 --> 11:45.711
Hey.

11:46.170 --> 11:47.654
- Linda said you were out here.
- MAN: (over PA) Attention, compound.

11:47.660 --> 11:49.295
- Attention, compound.
- What's up?

11:49.301 --> 11:52.889
- The canteen is now open for H Block.
- (sighs) I just needed some quiet.

11:53.969 --> 11:55.705
Okay. Is everything all right?

11:56.566 --> 11:58.295
(magpie cawing)

11:58.777 --> 12:00.090
It's just work.

12:01.277 --> 12:04.601
All right, that's why you have a deputy.

12:04.668 --> 12:06.624
I'm here to help you with your workload.

12:06.630 --> 12:07.830
Okay.

12:09.332 --> 12:10.573
(inhales)

12:11.742 --> 12:15.277
I just had a meeting with Will Jackson,

12:15.324 --> 12:17.457
and he claims...

12:18.307 --> 12:20.916
you are the officer supplying the drugs.

12:21.581 --> 12:22.894
(magpie cawing)

12:22.900 --> 12:24.100
What?!

12:26.791 --> 12:29.057
You see, I told you
he was gunning for me.

12:29.063 --> 12:31.080
And he also claims to have a witness.

12:32.607 --> 12:35.410
That's... (sighs) impossible.

12:35.588 --> 12:36.788
Okay.

12:37.260 --> 12:38.460
Who?!

12:38.466 --> 12:39.866
One of the prisoners.

12:40.532 --> 12:41.732
(sighs)

12:41.738 --> 12:43.391
(magpie cawing)

12:44.962 --> 12:46.969
You... you don't believe him?

12:48.264 --> 12:51.354
Vera, it's total bullshit!

12:51.360 --> 12:54.885
If he makes a formal complaint,
I have to investigate. So,

12:54.891 --> 12:57.854
- I shouldn't even be telling you this.
- I don't care about being investigated.

12:57.860 --> 12:59.060
I'm clean.

12:59.477 --> 13:01.412
I wanna know if you believe me.

13:03.021 --> 13:04.930
Of course, I...

13:04.936 --> 13:06.536
(magpie cawing)

13:06.615 --> 13:08.630
If you tell me it's not true...

13:10.216 --> 13:11.416
Vera...

13:11.898 --> 13:14.137
it is not true.

13:14.745 --> 13:16.480
- Good. (Chuckles quietly)
- (tense undertone)

13:17.136 --> 13:19.074
(magpie cawing)

13:19.471 --> 13:20.671
(sighs)

13:20.753 --> 13:24.075
- (exhales slowly)
- (music ends)

13:27.600 --> 13:29.013
- (gates beeps unlocked)
- (exhales)

13:32.991 --> 13:34.391
(gate banging closed)

13:39.101 --> 13:40.563
I have a problem.

13:41.788 --> 13:42.988
Oh?

13:43.181 --> 13:45.477
Will Jackson told Vera I'm dealing.

13:45.942 --> 13:49.173
She won't believe it. Not if
you've done your job properly.

13:49.179 --> 13:51.773
He's convinced one of the women
to come forward as a witness.

13:51.779 --> 13:53.649
Well, that is unfortunate.

13:53.655 --> 13:55.383
Who would that be?

13:55.571 --> 13:56.994
I dunno.

13:57.383 --> 13:59.912
The only ones who know
are Mercado and Chang...

14:00.199 --> 14:01.716
and you.

14:01.722 --> 14:04.910
We all have a vested interest.
There has to be somebody else.

14:04.916 --> 14:07.916
(quietly tense music intensifying)

14:12.216 --> 14:13.612
Shit!

14:14.837 --> 14:16.137
Novak.

14:18.934 --> 14:20.317
FERGUSON: Oh.

14:20.348 --> 14:21.781
Leave her to me.

14:22.074 --> 14:23.853
I need something from you.

14:24.177 --> 14:27.170
Doyle had a visitor this
morning. Find out who it was.

14:28.371 --> 14:34.667
(slowly and quietly whooshing flourish)

14:34.673 --> 14:36.048
(door echoes closed)

14:38.878 --> 14:40.446
Elizabeth Birdsworth.

14:40.932 --> 14:42.450
Sit down.

14:43.456 --> 14:46.251
Uh, it's... it's just Liz.

14:46.257 --> 14:48.231
I'm Detective Ayoub.

14:48.237 --> 14:51.442
I have some questions
regarding your perjury charge.

14:52.547 --> 14:53.747
Where's Don?

14:53.753 --> 14:55.853
- Sorry?
- Detective Kaplan.

14:56.064 --> 14:58.068
'Cause he... he can explain everything.

14:58.074 --> 15:00.248
Uh, we had a... a deal.

15:00.254 --> 15:02.670
Yes, we have a record of your deal.

15:02.676 --> 15:05.954
- Yeah, it... it was sanctioned.
- Nowhere in the deal

15:05.960 --> 15:07.965
does it say "lie to the court".

15:07.971 --> 15:11.132
I did th... I did that for you
lot 'cause he said you wouldn't...

15:11.138 --> 15:13.133
c... you wouldn't get
a conviction otherwise.

15:13.139 --> 15:15.493
So, it was Detective
Kaplan's idea to lie?

15:15.499 --> 15:16.699
Uh, no.

15:16.824 --> 15:18.853
No, not... not exactly.

15:19.435 --> 15:20.635
Um...

15:20.924 --> 15:23.731
I... I kn... I knew Sonia was guilty.

15:23.737 --> 15:24.937
Who told you that?

15:24.943 --> 15:27.631
It was obvious, I mean
we... we both knew.

15:27.837 --> 15:31.731
I mean I... I... I, but, I... I
just... I just couldn't get her, ah...

15:31.737 --> 15:33.538
I couldn't get her to confess.

15:33.544 --> 15:36.118
So, you went free-range
and lied under oath?

15:36.124 --> 15:39.099
I was... I was tryin'
to help Don. That's...

15:39.105 --> 15:41.554
It sounds like you
got quite close to him.

15:41.560 --> 15:42.760
Yeah.

15:43.421 --> 15:45.212
Oh, well, I mean, you know...

15:46.018 --> 15:47.218
Um...

15:47.623 --> 15:51.750
Why don't... why don't you get
him to come in here and, ah...

15:51.756 --> 15:55.251
he can... he can explain... everything.

15:55.257 --> 15:57.054
- I'd love to...
- Yeah.

15:57.141 --> 16:01.687
But he's gone on stress leave
after you destroyed his case.

16:02.561 --> 16:04.578
So, you haven't spoken to him?

16:04.584 --> 16:08.202
He's not at home, not answering
his phone, and no one's seen him.

16:08.515 --> 16:10.907
- Don is officially missing.
- (tense music intensifying)

16:15.143 --> 16:16.963
AYOUB: (muffled, warping and
echoing) Don... Don... Don...

16:16.969 --> 16:20.253
is officially missing... missing...
missing... missing... missing...

16:20.259 --> 16:22.854
and no one's seen him... seen him...

16:22.860 --> 16:26.838
(muffled, warping and
echoing) Oh, Liz... ha.

16:26.844 --> 16:30.078
I want to apologise for
my behaviour the other day.

16:30.084 --> 16:33.420
It was wrong of me to single you out
like that. It wasn't all your fault.

16:33.426 --> 16:36.576
- No, it doesn't matter.
- Well, it does... it does... it does...

16:36.582 --> 16:38.137
I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I'm sorry.

16:38.143 --> 16:41.527
Please come back to the garden.
I won't take no for an answer.

16:41.533 --> 16:44.520
(whispered) I like my friends close.

16:44.526 --> 16:47.315
Splendid. I'll see you tomorrow
then, we have work to do...

16:47.321 --> 16:49.498
(chuckles) work to do...
to do... to do... to do...

16:50.303 --> 16:54.119
(whooshing flourish)

16:56.761 --> 16:59.869
FEMALE: (over phone) The number
you have called is not connected.

16:59.875 --> 17:02.406
Please check the number
before calling again.

17:03.384 --> 17:04.584
Miss Bennett.

17:05.087 --> 17:06.287
She did it.

17:06.345 --> 17:08.661
- Who did what?
- I know she did it.

17:09.165 --> 17:10.365
Don's gone.

17:11.008 --> 17:13.406
- VERA: Are you all right, Birdsworth?
- Don's gone.

17:13.413 --> 17:15.294
- VERA: Liz?
- AYOUB: He's not answering his phone...

17:15.300 --> 17:17.295
his phone... his phone...
his phone... his phone...

17:17.300 --> 17:19.417
and no one's seen him...
seen him... seen him.

17:19.424 --> 17:20.624
(music ends)

17:23.773 --> 17:24.973
(knocking)

17:24.980 --> 17:26.397
Hey, what's up?

17:26.563 --> 17:28.520
- Need a favour.
- Sure.

17:33.368 --> 17:37.981
Remember you told me Stewart
gave you a bag of ice...

17:37.987 --> 17:40.477
Yeah, ages ago.

17:40.583 --> 17:42.896
Jackson reckons that
he's Tina's supplier.

17:42.902 --> 17:44.102
(hushed) Fuck!

17:44.108 --> 17:46.576
(sighs) I thought that
was just a once-off.

17:46.582 --> 17:48.290
Apparently not.

17:49.527 --> 17:50.727
What's the favour?

17:50.733 --> 17:53.005
I need you to tell the
Governor about Stewart.

17:53.011 --> 17:56.306
- What, and be a fucking lagger?!
- It's not lagging he's a screw.

17:56.312 --> 17:57.935
He's the Deputy Governor!

17:58.325 --> 18:00.001
- Fuck knows what he'll do to me!
- Sh... sh...

18:00.007 --> 18:03.009
- Jackson will have your back.
- Oh, wait, so...

18:03.110 --> 18:06.595
Mr Jackson put you up to this?
Forget it I'm not helping any screw.

18:06.601 --> 18:08.019
This isn't about screws, Allie.

18:08.025 --> 18:11.531
But why now, suddenly. I
begged you to do something.

18:12.038 --> 18:13.861
Because now...

18:14.029 --> 18:16.666
- we have proof.
- No!

18:16.951 --> 18:19.938
I can't do this without your help.

18:19.944 --> 18:21.344
(Allie sighs quietly)

18:21.538 --> 18:24.538
(dramatic music)

18:28.060 --> 18:29.260
(door closes)

18:34.293 --> 18:35.493
(music ends)

18:35.499 --> 18:38.385
I found out about Doyle's
visitor. I was her dad.

18:38.987 --> 18:40.907
He must be so proud.

18:42.877 --> 18:44.370
What are you gonna do about Novak?

18:44.376 --> 18:46.583
Nothing... just yet.

18:46.589 --> 18:47.908
I'll do it myself.

18:47.914 --> 18:49.186
You don't wanna do that.

18:49.384 --> 18:53.289
You're thinking like a pawn. You
need to think like a knigh... t.

18:53.388 --> 18:55.997
Yeah, that's, um...
that's really helpful.

18:56.091 --> 18:57.291
Hm!

19:00.025 --> 19:01.331
(drum beat flourish)

19:01.337 --> 19:02.735
- (inhales deeply)
- (dramatic music recommences)

19:05.415 --> 19:06.761
(drum beat flourish)

19:06.767 --> 19:08.984
(whispered) I need you
to do something for me...

19:09.101 --> 19:11.979
- (rapid drum beating flourish)
- (light echo off)

19:13.288 --> 19:16.110
(birds twittering)

19:16.218 --> 19:17.418
(music ends)

19:17.491 --> 19:19.649
MAN: (over PA) Attention, compound.
Attention, compound.

19:19.655 --> 19:22.054
D Block are now called for breakfast.

19:26.562 --> 19:27.762
(knocking)

19:28.757 --> 19:29.957
IMAN: Hey...

19:32.437 --> 19:35.379
Uh, um, I'm sorry I
lost it before. (Exhales)

19:35.553 --> 19:38.553
- Don't worry about it.
- No, no, you didn't do anything wrong.

19:38.741 --> 19:39.941
I just...

19:41.724 --> 19:43.553
don't like being fenced in.

19:43.559 --> 19:45.122
Well, this place must seem like a hotel

19:45.128 --> 19:47.898
- compared to those camps.
- (chuckles) Yeah.

19:48.530 --> 19:50.631
But, uh, I do miss the malaria,

19:50.637 --> 19:53.123
- drinkin' the shitty water...
- (both chuckle)

19:53.581 --> 19:56.300
At night the guards here
don't tuck you in the same way.

19:57.087 --> 19:58.995
Oh, fuckin' pigs!

19:59.792 --> 20:02.801
My mother protected me from
the worst, until she died.

20:02.807 --> 20:04.996
How are you not angry? I'd want blood.

20:05.613 --> 20:07.025
It's just a body.

20:08.372 --> 20:09.913
They can poke it,

20:09.919 --> 20:12.332
grunt on it, but it's not who you are.

20:13.816 --> 20:15.016
Nuh.

20:15.888 --> 20:17.388
Like prison, huh?

20:18.184 --> 20:20.482
You have to cover this bit.

20:22.409 --> 20:24.903
As long as they don't
get that then you're free.

20:27.975 --> 20:29.585
- We'll get you out of here.
- Hmm.

20:29.977 --> 20:31.266
(chuckles wryly)

20:34.456 --> 20:36.596
I can't get these posts you want.

20:37.860 --> 20:39.397
We'll find another way.

20:44.197 --> 20:46.096
FRANKY: Iman was just defending
herself against a troll.

20:46.102 --> 20:48.106
VERA: Yeah, I don't see how
internet access can help that.

20:48.112 --> 20:50.924
- I need copies of the abusive messages.
- Right, so get a lawyer onto it.

20:50.930 --> 20:53.533
Her public defender
has washed his hands.

20:53.608 --> 20:56.740
Our policy is very clear.
No internet for inmates.

20:56.746 --> 20:58.796
Oh, please, Miss B,
she's spent half her life

20:58.802 --> 21:00.508
- behind wire.
- I am aware of that, Doyle.

21:00.514 --> 21:02.272
Well, don't you think
she deserves a break?

21:02.335 --> 21:04.949
Look, I'm sorry, but every inmate
who wants to check their emails

21:04.955 --> 21:07.848
or chase Pokémons will be on my
doorstep. I can not make an exception.

21:07.854 --> 21:09.148
Her family's dead.

21:09.154 --> 21:10.710
She's got no one here.

21:10.716 --> 21:13.126
Now, you know how it works.
If she ends up in the system,

21:13.132 --> 21:15.279
all her friends, all her
peers are gonna be crims.

21:15.285 --> 21:16.671
Look, that is not necessarily true.

21:16.677 --> 21:18.976
She's gonna be in and out of
her for the rest of her life.

21:19.078 --> 21:21.978
Now, you literally have the
chance to give her a future,

21:21.984 --> 21:24.190
if you give me half
an hour on a computer.

21:26.002 --> 21:28.772
- Fifteen minutes. Supervised.
- (exhales)

21:31.939 --> 21:34.716
FEMALE: (over PA) Attention, compound.
Attention, compound.

21:34.722 --> 21:37.619
All women to report to
assigned work duties.

21:37.625 --> 21:40.625
(tense music intensifying)

22:00.193 --> 22:01.827
(whispered) Oh, no.

22:03.685 --> 22:05.717
(whispered) Oh, fuck!

22:09.490 --> 22:10.690
(whispered) Oh!

22:13.927 --> 22:15.127
(music ends)

22:15.133 --> 22:16.624
I can't believe he's been watching her.

22:16.630 --> 22:19.307
He touches a hair on her head
and I'll fuckin' kill 'im.

22:19.313 --> 22:21.381
(sighs) He's bluffing.

22:21.387 --> 22:22.978
Stewart's bluffing. There's no way...

22:22.984 --> 22:24.476
there is no way he's
gonna hurt a little kid.

22:24.482 --> 22:26.504
Well, I'm not gonna take the
chance on my little sister.

22:27.072 --> 22:28.272
Fuck!

22:28.568 --> 22:32.188
- How did he find out?!
- Who fuckin' cares!

22:32.194 --> 22:34.784
But there's no way that
you can go to Vera now.

22:34.790 --> 22:37.477
- I mean, I could show her these.
- What?! Fuck that!

22:37.483 --> 22:39.876
She's a little girl, I don't
want her dragged into it.

22:40.081 --> 22:41.810
I promised Kaz.

22:41.816 --> 22:43.601
So, unpromise her.

22:43.602 --> 22:47.486
- Well you know Kaz and her principles.
- Fuck her principles!

22:48.683 --> 22:49.883
(sighs deeply)

22:50.815 --> 22:52.307
You can't back out now.

22:52.313 --> 22:54.460
I have to, the message
is pretty fucking clear.

22:54.466 --> 22:57.494
If that photo was from Stewart,
he obviously knows about you.

22:57.500 --> 22:59.808
It gives us no choice. Now
we have to shut him down.

22:59.814 --> 23:02.398
I can't put Franky's
little sister in danger.

23:03.138 --> 23:05.992
I will make a call, get the
Red Right Hand to watch her.

23:05.998 --> 23:09.521
- I don't know about this, Kaz.
- Novak, your appointment.

23:09.607 --> 23:11.056
Yeah, just hang on.

23:11.062 --> 23:15.446
Allie, you know the girls.
They will keep her safe.

23:15.452 --> 23:16.838
Kaz...

23:18.527 --> 23:21.025
I need you to do this, bubba.

23:22.235 --> 23:23.986
I will protect her.

23:24.401 --> 23:26.586
I swear on my life.

23:30.241 --> 23:32.019
Let's go.

23:34.327 --> 23:37.327
(suspenseful music intensifying)

23:37.506 --> 23:38.906
(gate beeps unlocked)

23:44.887 --> 23:46.087
(gate beeps unlocked)

23:47.663 --> 23:49.063
(gate beeps unlocked)

24:04.904 --> 24:06.104
(knocking)

24:07.584 --> 24:08.784
Come in.

24:10.708 --> 24:12.410
Novak, take a seat.

24:13.982 --> 24:16.887
(whooshing flourish)

24:16.893 --> 24:21.391
Now, Mr Jackson tells me that you
were supplied with illicit drugs,

24:21.503 --> 24:23.891
by a member of my staff, an officer.

24:24.791 --> 24:28.083
- I don't wanna get into any trouble.
- You won't if you tell me the truth.

24:28.198 --> 24:31.362
- (sighs deeply)
- So, when exactly did this happen?

24:31.368 --> 24:33.441
Um, it was about three months ago.

24:33.447 --> 24:35.930
I fell off the wagon pretty
and I, ah, needed a...

24:36.160 --> 24:37.970
- hit, pretty bad.
- (music ends)

24:38.931 --> 24:40.739
And where was this transaction?

24:40.862 --> 24:42.795
- Ah, in H3...
- (suspenseful music recommences)

24:43.049 --> 24:44.249
I think.

24:47.782 --> 24:48.982
You think?

24:49.464 --> 24:50.960
Well, I was...

24:51.267 --> 24:52.896
a bit off my face.

24:55.184 --> 24:57.529
But, you do remember who it was?

24:57.763 --> 24:59.881
- Who...?
- Yes, which officer?

24:59.887 --> 25:01.185
Oh, yeah...

25:01.279 --> 25:03.080
I mean, no...

25:03.279 --> 25:07.001
n... not really, I...
that whole time was...

25:07.211 --> 25:10.437
- it was a bit of a blur.
- Mm-hm, so is that a yes or a no?

25:12.409 --> 25:15.409
(music intensifies
with drum beat accents)

25:19.182 --> 25:20.382
No.

25:21.987 --> 25:23.885
It's bull, Novak.

25:23.972 --> 25:25.776
You know exactly who it is.

25:26.383 --> 25:27.895
You told Proctor.

25:28.393 --> 25:29.660
(hushed) I'm sorry.

25:30.072 --> 25:32.403
- I can't remember.
- Yes you do.

25:33.614 --> 25:35.200
I can't remember.

25:35.824 --> 25:37.024
Look...

25:37.030 --> 25:38.497
who are you afraid of?

25:38.700 --> 25:39.909
No one.

25:39.915 --> 25:41.115
Then tell her.

25:41.121 --> 25:42.614
- I can't remember.
- Tell her!

25:42.620 --> 25:43.890
Mr Jackson!

25:44.982 --> 25:46.460
I can handle this.

25:49.496 --> 25:51.476
Has someone been threatening you?

25:52.801 --> 25:54.001
No.

25:58.126 --> 25:59.953
Because we can protect you.

26:00.165 --> 26:02.659
Sorry, Governor, I can't remember.

26:02.665 --> 26:04.860
- You don't want a moment? Yeah.
- No.

26:05.783 --> 26:08.650
Ah, thank you, Mr Jackson, you
can take Novak back to her unit.

26:08.656 --> 26:10.993
Um, if anything jogs your
memory you know where I am.

26:10.999 --> 26:12.199
Yeah.

26:14.470 --> 26:16.188
- (door closes)
- (music fades out)

26:16.194 --> 26:18.195
- What'd he threaten you with?
- (sighs) Nothing.

26:18.201 --> 26:20.085
- Who?!
- Why the sudden amnesia?

26:20.091 --> 26:23.322
Oh, leave me alone! I only told
Kaz what she wanted to hear.

26:23.566 --> 26:26.566
(atmospheric music)

26:59.492 --> 27:01.120
You did the right thing, bubba.

27:01.808 --> 27:03.097
You okay?

27:04.289 --> 27:05.730
I'm sorry.

27:06.385 --> 27:08.089
I was gonna tell her...

27:08.285 --> 27:10.214
really I was but...

27:10.515 --> 27:13.423
what if he got to her, Kaz,
I couldn't live with myself...

27:13.577 --> 27:16.874
- or any or us. If...
- No, it's okay. It's... it's my fault.

27:16.880 --> 27:18.080
Kaz...

27:18.155 --> 27:19.355
Kaz!

27:19.647 --> 27:21.700
(hushed) Oh, fuck!

27:29.066 --> 27:30.266
(sighs)

27:30.272 --> 27:31.472
(music ends)

27:33.083 --> 27:34.790
I didn't tell 'em anything.

27:35.911 --> 27:37.518
Well, you're not gonna be very popular.

27:37.524 --> 27:39.030
Yeah, tell me about it.

27:39.249 --> 27:40.449
(sighs)

27:41.334 --> 27:42.682
Thanks.

27:45.039 --> 27:46.718
Ready to get the fuck outta this joint?

27:46.724 --> 27:48.131
(chuckling) So ready!

27:49.250 --> 27:52.250
(dramatic music recommences)

27:54.147 --> 27:57.267
(music ends with a drum beats flourish)

28:02.497 --> 28:03.989
You still pissed off?

28:05.712 --> 28:07.388
Only with myself.

28:10.598 --> 28:12.599
You did what you thought was right.

28:13.161 --> 28:15.969
You and I used to
agree on what was right.

28:15.975 --> 28:20.507
Kaz, you're always so full-on
about protecting the women,

28:20.513 --> 28:23.738
but you were so quick to
put that little girl at risk.

28:27.242 --> 28:30.167
I promised you that she would be safe,

28:31.270 --> 28:34.638
and you used to believe me
when I made you a promise.

28:39.349 --> 28:40.549
(sighs quietly)

28:40.555 --> 28:42.524
What hope do I have
to win the women back

28:42.530 --> 28:45.147
when my best friend
doesn't even believe in me.

28:48.739 --> 28:50.454
It's not your fault.

28:51.329 --> 28:53.847
Nah, it's all right.
So, I fucked up, again.

28:53.853 --> 28:56.321
Well, it's okay... it's
okay to make a mistake.

28:56.327 --> 28:57.855
No. (Laughs unconvincingly)

28:58.620 --> 29:00.383
No, mate, it's not.

29:00.634 --> 29:02.950
I dragged you in here with me,

29:03.068 --> 29:04.873
cut a deal with Tina,

29:05.146 --> 29:08.204
let Ferguson terrorise everyone,

29:08.271 --> 29:09.643
including me,

29:10.295 --> 29:12.070
fuck knows what else.

29:12.589 --> 29:14.380
But you believe in something.

29:15.001 --> 29:16.201
They don't.

29:16.480 --> 29:20.097
(chuckles wryly and sniffles)

29:22.737 --> 29:23.937
(scoffs)

29:25.310 --> 29:26.510
Oh, well,

29:27.308 --> 29:28.508
I failed.

29:29.316 --> 29:31.402
- Kaz...
- It's okay.

29:37.121 --> 29:38.958
(keyboard and mouse clicking)

29:40.170 --> 29:41.370
(printer whirring)

29:43.831 --> 29:45.763
You know what I love about the internet?

29:45.943 --> 29:48.568
Anyone can get a root, even screws.

29:48.967 --> 29:52.132
Yeah, you're a real charming
piece of work, you are.

29:52.138 --> 29:55.266
Thank you, miss, means
so much coming from you.

29:56.875 --> 29:58.678
(mouse clicks)

30:02.610 --> 30:04.928
(urgent music)

30:18.282 --> 30:19.556
What have you got there?

30:19.659 --> 30:21.873
Stuff and things.

30:21.879 --> 30:23.471
(scroll wheel clicks)

30:23.477 --> 30:26.537
- Yeah, looks real fun.
- Oof. (Exhales deeply)

30:26.543 --> 30:28.552
Not as fun as hanging
out with you, miss.

30:29.459 --> 30:31.857
ALLIE: Oh, cool, can
I use the internet too?

30:31.863 --> 30:33.150
- GUARD: (scoffs) No.
- ALLIE: Oh, go on,

30:33.156 --> 30:34.480
I just wanna check my feed.

30:34.486 --> 30:35.720
GUARD: Nup, no chance.

30:35.726 --> 30:37.620
Oh, please? I've been in here for ages.

30:37.626 --> 30:39.736
Please, I just wanna
check up on my friends.

30:39.742 --> 30:42.988
- So?
- Go on, I'll make it worth your while.

30:43.032 --> 30:45.594
Hashtag: Piss off before I slot ya.

30:45.600 --> 30:48.270
Okay, fine, I'm going.

30:49.618 --> 30:51.907
(sighs) Thanks for
that. It was good for me.

30:51.913 --> 30:53.706
Doyle, let me see those.

30:53.712 --> 30:54.912
- (echoing drum beat flourish)
- (music becomes ominous)

30:54.918 --> 30:57.018
- Pass 'em here.
- Don't be like that.

31:06.547 --> 31:07.940
(music gradually fades out)

31:07.945 --> 31:09.883
- All good?
- Yeah, righto.

31:09.976 --> 31:11.563
Not what you were lookin' for, eh?

31:11.569 --> 31:14.055
- Off you go. Yeah, you too.
- Have a great day, miss.

31:15.261 --> 31:18.261
(pulsating music intensifying)

31:22.769 --> 31:25.528
Hey, Smiles, have you got the time?

31:25.777 --> 31:27.110
(whooshing flourish)

31:29.199 --> 31:30.410
Got a hot date, Novak?

31:30.416 --> 31:33.613
Ha, yeah! Oh, maybe
in, like, nine years,

31:33.710 --> 31:36.528
- four months, three weeks...
- (whooshing flourish)

31:37.987 --> 31:39.893
- (whooshing flourish)
- (fence rattles)

31:40.713 --> 31:43.612
two hours. Nah, I just wanted
to know when dinner was.

31:44.986 --> 31:46.416
(whooshing flourish)

31:51.756 --> 31:52.956
(fence rattles)

31:56.069 --> 31:57.269
Thanks.

32:15.944 --> 32:17.144
(music ends)

32:17.150 --> 32:19.217
(exhales slowly)

32:25.996 --> 32:27.782
Oi, you seen anyone in my cell?

32:27.788 --> 32:29.555
No. Why, have you lost something?

32:29.561 --> 32:31.393
Yeah, my kite necklace has gone missing.

32:31.399 --> 32:34.299
LIZ: (wailing and crying)
I killed him, oh, I just...

32:34.305 --> 32:36.303
I killed him.

32:36.317 --> 32:38.959
- Oh, it was... (sobbing uncontrollably)
- BOOMER: What the shit's goin' on?

32:38.965 --> 32:41.259
Some of us are tryin' to do stuff!

32:41.265 --> 32:42.491
- LIZ: I killed him.
- FRANKY: Come here.

32:42.497 --> 32:44.555
- Come on. You're right.
- (Liz blubbering incoherently)

32:44.561 --> 32:46.147
- Sh-sh-sh.
- (gentle music)

32:46.153 --> 32:48.182
- You're okay, take a seat.
- I killed him.

32:48.188 --> 32:49.414
BOOMER: Jesus Christ!

32:49.420 --> 32:51.508
What's going on? What's all the noise?

32:51.514 --> 32:53.450
Oh, it's nothing, Miss
Miles. It's all good.

32:53.456 --> 32:54.787
I killed him!

32:54.793 --> 32:56.170
- Sh-sh.
- Doesn't sound like nothing.

32:56.176 --> 32:58.687
No, Lizzie's just havin'
a nightmare, eh. Yeah.

32:58.693 --> 33:00.373
Yeah, she has 'em all
the time. It's fine.

33:00.379 --> 33:02.174
Let me know when she
really kills one of you.

33:02.180 --> 33:03.584
- Will do.
- Yeah.

33:03.670 --> 33:05.038
- Lizzie...
- I...

33:05.044 --> 33:07.426
- Lizzie, I need you to look at me.
- I killed... I killed... I can't...

33:07.432 --> 33:09.681
- Just look at me. Sh-sh-sh.
- You... you don't... you don't...

33:09.687 --> 33:11.746
- Oh, I killed him.
- I understand. Look at me.

33:11.752 --> 33:13.533
I understand. You just
need to look at me.

33:13.539 --> 33:16.307
- Come on. Come on. Shhh!
- I can't... 'cause I was killing...

33:16.313 --> 33:19.119
Look, deep breathes, all right. I
want you to take some deep breathes.

33:19.125 --> 33:22.409
- There you go. There you go. Sh-sh.
- (gasps) I... can't... I... I... I...

33:22.415 --> 33:24.271
You're just having a panic attack,

33:24.277 --> 33:26.112
- that's all. Shhh.
- Okay, (gasps) yeah.

33:26.118 --> 33:28.341
Yeah, you're right. Just
calm down, all right?

33:28.347 --> 33:30.642
(fading out) Here I am. Here I am.

33:30.648 --> 33:32.126
(Liz sobbing)

33:35.746 --> 33:38.546
- (music fading out)
- (birds twittering)

33:42.169 --> 33:44.574
MAN: (over PA) Attention, compound.
Attention, compound.

33:44.580 --> 33:46.887
Count will commence in ten minutes.- -

33:49.510 --> 33:50.827
(engine shuts off)

33:50.833 --> 33:52.833
(train crossing bells ringing)

33:53.112 --> 33:55.015
(train horn sounds)

33:55.021 --> 33:56.752
Lovely morning, Miss Bennett.

33:56.758 --> 33:58.229
- Mr Stewart.
- (Engine revving loudly)

34:02.155 --> 34:04.280
I should have told Will about us.

34:04.547 --> 34:07.064
Why? It's none of his business.

34:07.070 --> 34:09.739
Yeah, if he finds out from
someone else he will be livid.

34:12.514 --> 34:15.538
(train clattering on rails)

34:15.543 --> 34:17.329
No, I'm gonna tell him this afternoon.

34:17.335 --> 34:19.145
When I get back from this board meeting.

34:23.101 --> 34:25.138
(jaunty music)

34:25.143 --> 34:27.194
(grunts)

34:30.704 --> 34:32.145
(sighs)

34:36.371 --> 34:37.571
Hey!

34:38.254 --> 34:39.764
What do you two want?

34:44.159 --> 34:45.664
It's our mistake.

34:48.559 --> 34:49.759
(door slams)

34:51.909 --> 34:55.239
(echoing in pipes)

34:55.801 --> 35:00.124
- (water trickling and gurgling)
- (Ferguson humming to herself)

35:04.548 --> 35:07.032
(humming continues)

35:09.330 --> 35:11.952
- (humming continues)
- (metallic tapping)

35:11.958 --> 35:15.932
- (tapping continues)
- (buzzing)

35:23.982 --> 35:27.171
(mobile phone ringing
and vibrating quietly)

35:27.177 --> 35:29.177
(water trickling and gurgling)

35:32.477 --> 35:34.078
- (ring tone)
- (hushed) Fuck!

35:34.084 --> 35:36.273
- (mobile phone continues ringing)
- (growls)

35:36.852 --> 35:39.273
- (hushed) Oh, come on now.
- (ringing continues)

35:39.279 --> 35:40.562
(water and music stops)

35:41.890 --> 35:43.501
(tense undertone)

35:43.507 --> 35:45.171
- Hello?
- Dad...

35:45.177 --> 35:47.502
the weather's changed,
there's no showers today.

35:47.508 --> 35:50.694
Er, uh... yeah, good to know, um...

35:52.866 --> 35:54.066
(clears throat)

35:54.072 --> 35:57.541
Well, I might do some work in
the, ah, kitchen a bit later.

35:57.849 --> 35:59.281
Kitchen.

35:59.287 --> 36:02.287
(urgent music)

36:05.461 --> 36:06.661
Mmm.

36:06.667 --> 36:08.098
(whooshing flourish)

36:10.366 --> 36:12.577
(whooshing flourish)

36:12.583 --> 36:13.914
- (hushed) Shit!
- (door beeps unlocked)

36:13.920 --> 36:15.120
Quick.

36:15.126 --> 36:17.623
- (drum beat accents)
- (whooshing flourish)

36:17.629 --> 36:21.043
- Hey, you stay here, stall them.
- What with?!

36:21.116 --> 36:23.639
Swap... recipes!

36:24.616 --> 36:26.143
(whooshing flourish)

36:26.149 --> 36:27.614
(quiet tapping)

36:27.620 --> 36:28.953
(whooshing flourish)

36:29.191 --> 36:33.410
(tapping growing louder)

36:33.520 --> 36:34.848
(exhales with effort)

36:36.512 --> 36:38.405
- (music intensifying)
- (whooshing flourish)

36:43.147 --> 36:44.752
(whooshing flourish)

36:44.758 --> 36:45.958
(hushed) Fuck!

36:50.727 --> 36:52.247
- What are you doing here?
- (music quells)

36:52.253 --> 36:54.343
Well, I lost my hoodie.
I'm looking for it.

36:54.349 --> 36:56.108
I smell a rat.

36:56.114 --> 36:57.807
Well, it's your kitchen.

36:57.813 --> 36:59.013
(scraping)

36:59.727 --> 37:00.927
(utensil clatters)

37:00.933 --> 37:02.652
(ticking percussions shouts)

37:02.658 --> 37:05.808
I still owe you for
ripping me off last time.

37:05.930 --> 37:08.200
- (cover clatters quietly)
- (utensil clatters)

37:08.333 --> 37:09.533
(Franky sighs)

37:09.539 --> 37:11.051
Yeah, well fucking
get it over with then.

37:11.057 --> 37:12.569
Really, you're gonna bash me?!

37:14.363 --> 37:15.660
(quiet clattering)

37:15.666 --> 37:18.058
- MERCADO: Stealing bitch, I'm gonna...
- FRANKY: Oi, get off her!

37:18.064 --> 37:19.355
- ALLIE: Fuck!
- (echoing drum beat)

37:19.361 --> 37:20.886
What the fuck are you gwai lo bitches

37:20.894 --> 37:23.066
- doing in my kitchen, huh?!
- (breathlessly) Looking for my hoodie.

37:23.072 --> 37:24.328
It wasn't in the kitchen.

37:24.334 --> 37:26.232
- Yeah. Fuck. I told you.
- Oh...

37:26.238 --> 37:28.572
- yeah, big fucking surprise, huh?
- Fuck off!

37:28.578 --> 37:29.846
What's going on ladies?

37:30.042 --> 37:31.246
Nothin' boss...

37:31.345 --> 37:33.624
(sighs) just leavin'.

37:33.630 --> 37:36.630
(urgent music recommenced)

37:39.012 --> 37:42.333
(door squeaks closed)

37:43.396 --> 37:45.306
- (Stewart sighs)
- You need to fix this.

37:45.312 --> 37:46.512
(door beeps unlocked)

37:47.223 --> 37:48.423
(music ends)

37:48.429 --> 37:50.514
Ah, Governor, look...

37:50.520 --> 37:52.191
someone obviously got to Novak, okay.

37:52.197 --> 37:53.836
- I need your permission to...
- Will, I did what you asked

37:53.842 --> 37:55.636
and I listened to her,
but by her own admission

37:55.642 --> 37:57.111
she couldn't remember anything.

37:57.197 --> 37:59.267
- Is everything all right?
- I've got to get to a board meeting.

37:59.273 --> 38:00.798
Novak was clearly lying to you

38:00.804 --> 38:02.434
and normally you wouldn't
let her get away with that.

38:02.440 --> 38:03.973
She had nothing useful to say.

38:03.979 --> 38:05.335
And you would have followed up.

38:05.341 --> 38:07.810
Call the Governor at Walford
and ask why Stewart left.

38:08.811 --> 38:11.029
I have better things to do with my time.

38:11.035 --> 38:12.966
Why? Are you afraid
of what you might find?

38:12.972 --> 38:15.528
No, I'm afraid of engaging in
a witch-hunt. Now, I have to go.

38:16.052 --> 38:17.252
(sighs)

38:18.231 --> 38:19.870
(chair clatters)

38:22.324 --> 38:23.527
How'd you get Novak

38:23.533 --> 38:25.419
- to change her story?
- Are you right there?

38:25.425 --> 38:27.012
What, did you bribe her or threaten her?

38:27.121 --> 38:28.321
Hmm?

38:29.253 --> 38:31.379
I know you went to
the Governor about me.

38:31.863 --> 38:33.964
That's fair enough,
you're just doing your job.

38:34.302 --> 38:36.310
But there's no need to get personal.

38:36.927 --> 38:38.136
- You see... y... y...
- (echoing drum beat)

38:38.142 --> 38:40.014
- you might have sucked in Vera,
- (tense music)

38:40.404 --> 38:42.521
- but I now you're a lying prick, Jakey.
- (chuckles)

38:42.527 --> 38:44.013
Now Will, mate... ugh!

38:44.019 --> 38:46.795
Don't fuckin' "Will,
mate" me, all right?

38:46.869 --> 38:50.095
See, the thing is, one day very
soon I'm gonna catch you red-handed,

38:50.101 --> 38:52.197
okay? And then Vera will find out.

38:52.203 --> 38:54.408
- You got that? Yeah?
- (chuckling)

38:54.499 --> 38:56.195
(laughing)

38:56.201 --> 38:58.390
And how's that gonna work, big guy?

38:59.593 --> 39:00.793
You see...

39:01.194 --> 39:02.600
Vera and me,

39:02.883 --> 39:04.383
we're living together.

39:05.946 --> 39:10.666
Yes, I'm fucking Vera, you hammerhead.

39:10.672 --> 39:12.672
(music intensifying)

39:14.208 --> 39:17.321
I'm Teflon, mate. You can't touch me.

39:21.223 --> 39:22.423
(music ends)

39:26.484 --> 39:27.856
Is Vera back?

39:27.862 --> 39:29.732
- What's goin' on?
- I need to talk to her.

39:29.738 --> 39:31.464
She's at a board meeting
but Jake's on duty.

39:31.470 --> 39:32.670
Fuck Jake!

39:32.676 --> 39:34.956
(tools whirring)

39:44.878 --> 39:47.007
Hey, check this out.

39:47.196 --> 39:49.624
If we leave these boxes out

39:49.630 --> 39:51.626
there's enough room
for us to get in here.

39:51.632 --> 39:52.965
Oh, yeah, it's good.

39:53.317 --> 39:54.948
We just need to find
a place to stash 'em

39:54.954 --> 39:56.511
where no one will stumble across 'em.

39:56.899 --> 39:59.160
Easier if we don't
assemble 'em, I guess?

39:59.335 --> 40:00.959
And we'll do it in a few trips.

40:04.038 --> 40:06.166
Come on. Gotcha.

40:06.172 --> 40:08.373
(sprinklers ticking)

40:08.648 --> 40:09.977
- Liz?
- Ooh!

40:10.117 --> 40:12.581
God, Sonia, where'd you creep up from?

40:12.587 --> 40:15.274
I've organised a lovely
new spade for you.

40:15.280 --> 40:16.664
Oh, right.

40:16.940 --> 40:18.140
Thanks.

40:19.280 --> 40:22.648
I've heard you hadn't been sleeping
very well. Is everything all right?

40:22.987 --> 40:24.857
Yeah. Yeah. I'm good.

40:25.396 --> 40:28.613
Well, if there's anything I can
do, you'll let me know, won't you?

40:29.512 --> 40:30.881
That's a nice thing to say.

40:30.887 --> 40:32.087
I mean it, Liz.

40:32.380 --> 40:34.512
We'd be lost if
anything happened to you.

40:41.489 --> 40:44.445
- Liz...
- Ooh, ha, hey.

40:45.286 --> 40:47.869
- So peaceful in here
- Yeah.

40:47.875 --> 40:49.177
It's lovely working with such

40:49.183 --> 40:50.585
- beautiful things too.
- Mmm.

40:50.591 --> 40:51.918
So, I heard you went to the doctor

40:51.924 --> 40:54.016
- this morning. Good.
- Yeah I did, yeah.

40:54.022 --> 40:55.418
Everything's a lot clearer now.

40:55.424 --> 40:57.332
- I'm so glad to hear that.
- Yeah.

40:57.441 --> 40:58.934
I know Sonia did it.

40:59.925 --> 41:01.418
What did she do, Liz?

41:01.424 --> 41:03.637
She killed Detective
Kaplan, Miss Bennett.

41:04.026 --> 41:05.452
And I wanna prove it.

41:09.708 --> 41:10.908
(door opening)

41:12.224 --> 41:13.544
Governor.

41:15.533 --> 41:17.647
I need to talk to you about something.

41:22.221 --> 41:24.244
I wanted to tell you, really.

41:25.243 --> 41:29.959
Really, I did. It just
became... too messy.

41:31.279 --> 41:33.607
You know we've been
through a lot together,

41:34.346 --> 41:36.670
I just thought you had more integrity.

41:38.409 --> 41:41.069
Will, there's nothing in the regulations
against couple working together.

41:41.075 --> 41:42.792
- You know that. Well, I'm not
- Meg never tried to hide it.

41:42.798 --> 41:44.480
Trying to hide it, I just
don't want it advertised.

41:44.486 --> 41:46.508
(chuckling) Fine. You
know, at least I get it now.

41:47.179 --> 41:49.668
I mean, you're the one who
tipped off Jake, aren't you?

41:51.233 --> 41:52.633
- Aren't you?
- No.

41:52.842 --> 41:54.042
(chuckles disbelievingly)

41:54.241 --> 41:55.441
(chuckles)

41:55.780 --> 41:56.980
Yeah?

41:56.986 --> 41:58.911
Well, you've been
defending him all along.

41:59.374 --> 42:00.294
Well, he's def...

42:00.390 --> 42:03.070
he's entitled to the same presumption
of innocence as anyone else.

42:03.076 --> 42:05.133
Yeah, but you didn't
waste any time demoting me.

42:05.139 --> 42:07.764
You were suspended for a positive
drug test, Will. That test...

42:07.770 --> 42:10.575
- that had nothing to do with Jake.
- Who do you think gave me the eccy?

42:11.177 --> 42:14.552
(scoffs) And... and you gave him my job.

42:17.348 --> 42:18.548
(hushed) Fuck!

42:18.554 --> 42:20.427
Well, he's only acting in the position.

42:22.641 --> 42:23.841
Vera...

42:23.946 --> 42:25.146
(sighs)

42:25.337 --> 42:27.425
he's a snake, okay, you don't know him.

42:27.431 --> 42:28.815
Well, I think I know
him better than you.

42:28.821 --> 42:30.860
He'll use you and then turn on you too,

42:30.866 --> 42:32.066
- okay.
- You are...

42:32.165 --> 42:34.650
y... you want revenge on him so badly

42:34.656 --> 42:36.954
- it is distorting your thinking.
- My thinking?!

42:36.960 --> 42:39.274
You're the one who's
fucking a drug dealer!

42:39.345 --> 42:41.562
(sighs)

42:45.757 --> 42:46.957
(sighs deeply)

42:46.963 --> 42:49.053
Okay, why don't you come
back when you've calmed down.

42:49.230 --> 42:50.430
(chuckles disbelievingly)

42:50.436 --> 42:51.840
I'll be back...

42:52.445 --> 42:54.031
after I've seen Channing.

42:58.154 --> 42:59.354
(door opens)

43:00.216 --> 43:01.416

43:21.166 --> 43:22.469

43:22.720 --> 43:25.599
Mike Pennisi?
