WEBVTT

00:02.103 --> 00:11.979
>> Announcer: PREVIOUSLY ON
"BIG BROTHER," WITH THE ENTIRE

00:12.012 --> 00:16.784
HOUSE TRUSTING PAUL, HE SECRETLY
WANTED TO SPLIT UP JASON AND

00:16.817 --> 00:17.851
ALEX.

00:17.885 --> 00:18.986
>> IN A PERFECT WORLD, ONE OF
YOU TWO TAKE THE SHOT.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.989
>> I WANT THE TAKE A SHOT.

00:22.022 --> 00:30.231
>> WITH CHRISTMAS AND JOSH ON
SHOT -- BOARD TO TAKE A SHOT AT

00:30.264 --> 00:34.001
ALEX AND JASON, I JUST HAVE TO
SIT BACK.

00:34.034 --> 00:46.013
>> I TOLL KEVIN, ON LIKE THE
FIRST DAY THROW IT.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.448
>> I'M LITERALLY SPEECHLESS.

00:47.481 --> 00:53.121
>> AND ONE BY ONE THEY WENT.

00:53.154 --> 00:54.322
GIVING CHRISTMAS THE CROWN.

00:54.355 --> 01:02.029
>> CHRISTMAS IS THE NEW HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD.

01:02.062 --> 01:05.999
>> JASON IS MY NUMBER-ONE
TARGET, BUT ALEX IS MY BACK-UP.

01:06.033 --> 01:09.970
WE HAVE TO SPLIT THIS SUPER
COUPLE, AND I'M THE LUCKY ONE

01:10.003 --> 01:12.540
THAT GETS TO TAKE THE SHOT.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.508
>> Announcer: THINKING KEVIN
WAS THE TARGET --

01:14.542 --> 01:17.044
>> I LOVE CHRISTMAS AND SHE'S A
TRUE HOMEY AND SHE'S GOING TO DO

01:17.077 --> 01:19.380
WHAT WE HAVE TO DO.

01:19.413 --> 01:23.251
>> Announcer: -- ALEX
VOLUNTEERED TO BE A PAWN.

01:23.284 --> 01:25.353
>> OKAY.

01:25.386 --> 01:32.693
>> Announcer: JOSHMA S AND
PAUL DECIDED ALEX AND PAUL

01:32.726 --> 01:36.063
NEEDED TO GO UP TOGETHER.

01:36.096 --> 01:42.069
BUT AFTER ALEX THOUGHT KEVIN
SHOULD BE A BACK DOOR.

01:42.102 --> 01:45.072
>> KEVIN IS THE TARGET THIS
WEEK, BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:45.105 --> 01:48.075
WE DON'T FREAK HIM OUT, BECAUSE
HE GETS SUPER PARANOID WHEN HE

01:48.108 --> 01:50.644
THINKS HE'S GOING UP ON THE
BLOCK, SO I THINK IT IS BETTER

01:50.678 --> 01:53.381
TO PUT UP TWO PAWNS SO HE WON'T
SEE THE BACK DOOR COMING.

01:53.414 --> 01:57.084
>> ALEX PROPOSED TWO PAWNS TO
CHRISTMAS.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.086
>> DO YOU WANT TO PUT UP TWO
PAWNS AND HIM OR ONE PAWN WITH

01:59.119 --> 01:59.953
HIM.

01:59.987 --> 02:03.191
IT'S UP TO YOU HOW FAR YOU GO
WITH THAT.

02:03.224 --> 02:07.127
>> ALEX HAS SUGGESTED TWO PAWNS
GO UP.

02:07.161 --> 02:11.599
DO I MAKE IT SEEM LIKE IT'S
PAWNS AND THE PLAN IS TO BACK

02:11.632 --> 02:13.100
DOOR KEVIN?

02:13.133 --> 02:15.669
OR DO I MAKE IT CLEAR JASON IS
MY TARGET?

02:15.703 --> 02:18.572
AT THIS POINT I HAVE TO DECIDE
WHETHER I WANT THE PLAY THE

02:18.606 --> 02:24.111
HONEST GAME OR THE SNEAKY SNAKE
GAME.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.479
>> AT THE NOMINATION CEREMONY...

02:25.513 --> 02:29.383
>> I HAVE NOMINATED YOU ALEX AND
YOU JASON.

02:29.417 --> 02:31.118
>> Announcer: CHRISTMAS DREW A
LINE IN THE SAND.

02:31.151 --> 02:34.888
>> JASON, I HAVE NOMINATED YOU
BECAUSE YOU ARE AN INCREDIBLE

02:34.922 --> 02:35.456
COMPETITOR.

02:35.489 --> 02:36.690
YOU ARE A TRIPLE THREAT.

02:36.724 --> 02:39.493
AND WITH THAT I NEED TO BE ABLE
TO IN THIS POSITION TAKE OUT A

02:39.527 --> 02:41.862
STRONG MALE FIGURE.

02:41.895 --> 02:44.532
>> Announcer: BUT JALEX DIDN'T
QUITE GET IT.

02:44.565 --> 02:48.168
>> BUT I DO TRUST CHRISTMAS AND
I TRUST HER JUDGMENT.

02:48.202 --> 02:50.304
SHE MUST HAVE PLAN TO BACK DOOR
KEVIN.

02:50.338 --> 02:53.374
>> Announcer: TONIGHT, WILL
THE POWER OF VETO SAVE JASON OR

02:53.407 --> 02:56.944
ALEX, AND BOBBY MOYNIHAN
SURPRISES THE HOUSEGUESTS.

02:56.977 --> 02:58.612
PLUS SOMEONE IS ON TO PAUL'S
GAME.

02:58.646 --> 03:01.582
WILL THE PUPPET MASTER FINALLY
BE EXPOSED?

03:01.615 --> 03:13.761
ALL THIS RIGHT NOW ON "BIG
BROTHER."

03:13.794 --> 03:19.132
>> THIS NOMINATION CEREMONY IS
ADJOURNED.

03:19.166 --> 03:22.069
I NOMINATED JASON AND ALEX THIS
WEEK BECAUSE IT'S TIME THAT WE

03:22.102 --> 03:25.172
TAKE CARE OF THAT SUPER DUO.

03:25.205 --> 03:28.442
JASON IS MY MAIN TARGET, SO IF
ALL GOES WELL, I'M GOING TO SEND

03:28.476 --> 03:33.781
THAT COW BY RIDING OFF INTO THE
SUNSET TO JURY HOUSE.

03:33.814 --> 03:34.548
YEE-HAW.

03:34.582 --> 03:37.718
>> I'M NOT LETTING YOU WIN,
SO...

03:37.751 --> 03:41.088
>> I EXPECTED TO BE A PAWN
BECAUSE I AGREED TO IT, BUT

03:41.121 --> 03:42.256
JASON, JASON!

03:42.290 --> 03:45.393
BUT LIKE I NEED TO RELAX,
BECAUSE WE DO HAVE PLAN, AND IT

03:45.426 --> 03:46.994
IS TO GET KEVIN OUT.

03:47.027 --> 03:50.431
JASON AND I JUST NEED TO WIN
THAT VETO SO WE CAN SEND OLD MAN

03:50.464 --> 03:58.306
RIVER UP THE RIVER.

03:58.339 --> 04:01.375
>> CHRISTMAS PUT ME AND ALEX ON
THE BLOCK.

04:01.409 --> 04:03.944
THE LIFE INSTANTLY GOT SUCKED
OUT OF ME.

04:03.977 --> 04:07.281
I WAS PRETTY CERTAIN THAT THE
PLAN WAS TO GET KEVIN OUT, SO I

04:07.315 --> 04:10.484
DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

04:10.518 --> 04:21.962
AT ALL.

04:21.995 --> 04:26.734
>> THIS IS ALL JUST THE GET HIM
OUT, RIGHT?

04:26.767 --> 04:28.869
>> I DON'T KNOW.

04:28.902 --> 04:32.172
NOBODY SAID NOTHING TO ME ABOUT
IT.

04:32.205 --> 04:35.543
>> NEWS FLASH, I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT'S GOING ON, BECAUSE IT WAS

04:35.576 --> 04:39.480
ALL MY IDEA TO TARGET YOU.

04:39.513 --> 04:42.149
>> JUST KEEP CALM.

04:42.182 --> 04:43.717
>> IF YOU START FREAKING OUT...

04:43.751 --> 04:47.988
>> I'M IN THE FREAKING OUT
BECAUSE I HAVE KNOW IDEA WHAT'S

04:48.021 --> 04:49.189
GOING ON.

04:49.222 --> 04:51.692
>> THERE'S NOTHING THAT HAPPENS
HERE THAT PAUL DOES NOT KNOW

04:51.725 --> 04:59.232
ABOUT, SO I'M FAIRLY CERTAIN
THAT I'M BEING KIND OF DUPED BY

04:59.266 --> 05:04.538
PAUL TO KEEP ME CALM, SO THAT'S
KIND OF CREEPY.

05:04.572 --> 05:06.807
SOMEBODY AIRLIFT ME OUT OF HERE.

05:06.840 --> 05:16.350
I CAN'T TAKE IT.

05:16.384 --> 05:18.619
>> YOU ALL RIGHT?

05:18.652 --> 05:19.453
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

05:19.487 --> 05:21.321
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON
HERE.

05:21.355 --> 05:23.090
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING
ON?

05:23.123 --> 05:23.991
>> I DON'T KNOW.

05:24.024 --> 05:27.928
>> THEY CAN'T PUT BOTH OF YOU UP
AS PAWNS.

05:27.961 --> 05:28.762
USE YOUR HEADS.

05:28.796 --> 05:30.698
THEY'RE HOPING ONE OF YOU GUYS
GO HOME.

05:30.731 --> 05:33.767
WHAT THEY'RE DOING NOW IS YOU
AND ALEX ARE THE BEST TO

05:33.801 --> 05:34.768
PLAYERS.

05:34.802 --> 05:36.169
THEY DON'T HAVE A CHANCE TO GET
YOU BOTH AGAIN.

05:36.203 --> 05:37.337
SO THINK ABOUT IT.

05:37.371 --> 05:41.108
>> HOW THE HELL WOULD YOU KNOW
IF I'M THE TARGET OR NOT THE

05:41.141 --> 05:42.209
TARGET?

05:42.242 --> 05:44.545
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF I'M THE
TARGET OR NOT THE TARGET.

05:44.578 --> 05:47.781
>> IF YOU DON'T WIN, YOU'RE
GOING HOME, SO IF YOU WIN, SHE'S

05:47.815 --> 05:49.583
GOING HOME.

05:49.617 --> 05:51.318
AND THAT'S JUST HOW IT IS, JAY.

05:51.351 --> 05:54.788
I KNOW SHE'S YOUR GIRL, BUT
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

05:54.822 --> 05:57.290
THEY'RE NOT USING NO ONE AS
PAWN.

05:57.324 --> 06:00.928
I DON'T LIKE SEEING JASON ON THE
BLOCK.

06:00.961 --> 06:02.295
HE'S DISTRAUGHT.

06:02.329 --> 06:04.565
SOMETIMES THINGS ARE AS THEY
APPEAR.

06:04.598 --> 06:05.733
DON'T BE AN IDIOT.

06:05.766 --> 06:06.634
I DIDN'T TALK TO NOBODY.

06:06.667 --> 06:09.036
I CAN SEE WHAT JUST HAPPENED.

06:09.069 --> 06:11.171
YOU GOT IT, KNUCKLEHEAD.

06:11.204 --> 06:21.248
FINALLY, IT HIT YOU.

06:21.248 --> 06:26.954
FINALLY, IT HIT YOU.

06:26.987 --> 06:29.089
>> WHO IS WORKING TOGETHER?

06:29.122 --> 06:34.361
>> I THINK SHE'S DOING IT TO
THROW HOMEY OFF, BUT I HAVE NO

06:34.394 --> 06:35.529
IDEA.

06:35.563 --> 06:37.831
>> MY MAN JASON BUSTS THROUGH
THE DOORS AND HE'S COMING IN

06:37.865 --> 06:39.032
HOT.

06:39.066 --> 06:42.035
HE'S ASKING ME ALL TYPE OF CRAZY
QUESTIONS, AND I'M TRYING TO

06:42.069 --> 06:45.272
DIFFUSE THIS GUY, DO A LITTLE
BIT OF DAMAGE CONTROL SO HE

06:45.305 --> 06:48.609
DOESN'T GO CRAZY AND WIN THIS
VETO.

06:48.642 --> 06:51.278
WE GOT TO GET HIM OUT OF THIS
HOUSE, ESPECIALLY NOW THAT WE

06:51.311 --> 06:51.979
HAVE THE CHANCE.

06:52.012 --> 06:54.848
>> WHY WOULD YOU PUT BOTH OF US?

06:54.882 --> 06:57.084
YOU PUT RAVEN UP?

06:57.117 --> 06:59.953
YOU MEAN TO TELL ME NOW THEY'RE
GOING TO START WORKING WITH

06:59.987 --> 07:04.157
RAVEN?

07:04.191 --> 07:07.194
I THINK I'M GETTING BACK DOORED
100%.

07:07.227 --> 07:08.295
>> BY WHO?

07:08.328 --> 07:12.766
>> YOU ALL THREW THE COMP TO
HER.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.835
>> YOU CAN'T GET BACK DOORED.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.604
THERE ARE SEVEN, ALL BUT ONE.

07:16.637 --> 07:20.173
I COULD BE THE ONE.

07:20.207 --> 07:22.743
NOW GET OUT OF HERE.

07:22.776 --> 07:25.378
>> WHY WOULD PAUL THINK THAT?

07:25.412 --> 07:27.481
THAT SCARES ME.

07:27.515 --> 07:29.517
>> I THINK HE KNOWS WHAT'S GOING
ON.

07:29.550 --> 07:32.653
>> IS PAUL WAS ORIGINALLY PART
OF THIS PLAN, BUT NOW HE'S

07:32.686 --> 07:34.855
TRYING TO GET ON EVERYBODY'S
GOOD SIDE.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.089
THIS GUY IS GOOD.

07:36.123 --> 07:40.393
HE'S WORKING ALL ANGLES, HE'S
WORKING EVERYBODY, AND I'M EVEN

07:40.427 --> 07:50.671
BUYING IT.

07:50.704 --> 07:56.009
>> JASON, YOU'RE BEING WIGGY.

07:56.043 --> 07:58.846
>> I'M DOING MY BEST.

07:58.879 --> 08:02.650
>> I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO POOP
MY PANTS.

08:02.683 --> 08:03.651
>> YOU?

08:03.684 --> 08:05.853
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO POOP
MINE RIGHT THERE.

08:05.886 --> 08:12.760
>> KEVIN SAID, YOU AND ALEX ARE
GOING HOME, BUD, OPEN YOUR EYES.

08:12.793 --> 08:19.533
HE SAID, YOU BETTER WIN THE
VETO.

08:19.567 --> 08:25.639
I'M GOING... MY GUT WAS SAYING,
IT'S OKAY, BUT MY HEAD WAS

08:25.673 --> 08:26.707
SAYING, WHY BOTH OF YOU?

08:26.740 --> 08:28.842
>> I TRUST IN HER.

08:28.876 --> 08:36.149
I TRUST IN CHRISTMAS.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.852
IT'S ME, YOU, OR PAUL.

08:38.886 --> 08:47.127
SO I TRUST WHATEVER IT IS.

08:47.160 --> 08:48.562
>> IT WAS SCARY.

08:48.596 --> 08:49.897
>> IT HAD TO BE REAL.

08:49.930 --> 08:54.134
>> JASON, ACTUALLY EVERYTHING
THAT I SAID IN MY SPEECH WAS

08:54.167 --> 08:58.906
TRUE, SO I'M NOT SURE WHY YOU
ARE CONVINCED YOU ARE SUPER

08:58.939 --> 08:59.339
SAFE.

08:59.372 --> 09:03.076
WOW.

09:03.110 --> 09:06.346
>> SEE WHY YOU CANNOT TALK TO
HIM?

09:06.379 --> 09:08.381
I TRUST IN OUR TEAM.

09:08.415 --> 09:12.920
>> THEY'RE TELLING ME ANOTHER
TARGET, BUT I'M HAVING A REALLY,

09:12.953 --> 09:16.189
REALLY, REALLY HARD TIME
BELIEVING IT, BECAUSE I AM ON

09:16.223 --> 09:20.327
THE BLOCK NEXT TO ALEX.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.996
SO I'M JUST TRYING THE STAY
CALM.

09:23.030 --> 09:31.004
>> STAY CALM AND YOU'LL BE FINE.

09:31.038 --> 09:40.013
>> I WAS LIKE... THE ONLY WAY
THEY'RE THINKING THIS IS

09:40.047 --> 09:41.381
BECAUSE... I SAID WHAT I SAID.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.150
>> THIS IS PERFECT.

09:43.183 --> 09:46.620
>> NOW JASON OR KEVIN CAN
NOMINATE.

09:46.654 --> 09:53.326
>> DO I USE THE VETO AND PULL
HER OFF?

09:53.360 --> 09:55.562
THEN YOU PUT KEVIN UP.

09:55.595 --> 10:02.703
>> WE KEEP ALEX.

10:02.736 --> 10:06.439
I AM IN AMAZEMENT WITH HOW MUCH
JASON AND ALEX ARE BELIEVING

10:06.473 --> 10:09.677
THAT THEY'RE SAFE.

10:09.710 --> 10:12.813
NOW ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS WIN THE
VETO SO WE CAN CONTROL

10:12.846 --> 10:14.481
EVERYTHING THIS WEEK.

10:14.514 --> 10:16.917
>> THEY'RE GETTING BAMBOOZLED.

10:16.950 --> 10:20.187
>> THEY'RE NOT EVEN GETTING
BAMBOOZLED.

10:20.220 --> 10:31.231
THEY'RE BAMBOOZLING THEMSELVES.

10:31.264 --> 10:32.265
OH, MY GOD.

10:41.641 --> 10:42.009
>> OKAY.

10:42.042 --> 10:42.509
>> OH, MY GOD.

10:42.542 --> 10:43.643
>> DON'T PANIC YET.

10:43.677 --> 10:48.816
>> IF ONE OF US DOESN'T COME OFF
THE BLOCK

10:48.849 --> 10:55.255
>> WE'RE NOT BACK DOORING YOU,
RIGHT?

10:55.288 --> 10:56.489
THEY WERE WONDERING.

10:56.523 --> 11:02.062
>> LISTEN, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE HECK IS GOING ON AND WHO IS

11:02.095 --> 11:09.636
PART OF ANYTHING.

11:09.669 --> 11:14.241
SO LET'S THINK ABOUT THIS, SO IF
YOU WIN, OBVIOUSLY YOU PULL

11:14.274 --> 11:15.976
YOURSELF OFF.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.610
>> I'LL PULL HIM OFF.

11:17.644 --> 11:20.047
HE GETS SQUIRRELY.

11:20.080 --> 11:25.152
>> BEST-CASE SCENARIO WOULD BE
ME TO WIN.

11:25.185 --> 11:30.023
SHE PUTS KEVIN UP.

11:30.057 --> 11:32.025
>> SO YOU WANT ME TO PULL HIM
OFF?

11:32.059 --> 11:34.327
>> YES.

11:34.361 --> 11:35.662
>> PULL WITHIN OF US OFF.

11:35.695 --> 11:38.766
>> LAST WEEK I CONVINCED
EVERYBODY TO THROW THE H.O.H.

11:38.799 --> 11:40.000
COMPETITION TO CHRISTMAS.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.936
THIS WEEK I'M TRYING TO GET THE
TWO NOMINEES TO THROW THE VETO

11:42.970 --> 11:44.104
COMPETITION TO ME.

11:44.137 --> 11:47.274
IF I CAN PULL THIS OFF, YOU
MIGHT AS WELL CALL ME HOUDINI.

11:47.307 --> 11:51.378
>> WE'RE TALKING SERIOUS GAME.

11:51.411 --> 11:52.045
EVERYBODY IS DEEP.

11:52.079 --> 11:55.448
EVERYBODY IS DEEP WITH YOU.

11:55.482 --> 11:59.486
>> GO FOR THE VETO, HE WIN,
PULLS ONE OF US OFF.

11:59.519 --> 12:01.021
HE'S SAFE, TOO.

12:01.054 --> 12:06.326
>> AND MAYBE THEY'LL PUT YOU UP
BECAUSE APPARENTLY YOU'RE IN AN

12:06.359 --> 12:11.698
ALLIANCE WITH CHRISTMAS.

12:11.731 --> 12:12.365
>> WHAT?

12:12.399 --> 12:15.468
>> I'M JUST MAKING STUFF UP.

12:15.502 --> 12:17.337
>> YOU CAN'T DO THINGS LIKE
THAT.

12:17.370 --> 12:21.408
>> THAT'S FUNNY, BECAUSE JASON'S
NOT ONE TO THROW THESE LITTLE

12:21.441 --> 12:22.575
ASSUMPTIONS LEFT AND RIGHT.

12:22.609 --> 12:25.913
SOMEBODY IS FEEDING HIM AND
PLANTING THE SEED IN ORDER TO

12:25.946 --> 12:26.914
VOICE THAT OPINION.

12:26.947 --> 12:28.849
PAUL, WHAT IS IT THAT YOU'RE UP
TO, BUDDY?

12:28.882 --> 12:32.285
>> IF I WIN, I PULL YOU OFF.

12:32.319 --> 12:35.688
THAT MEANS KEVIN GOES UP.

12:35.722 --> 12:40.527
IF KEVIN IS UP THERE WITH ALEX,
HE'S GOING TO CAMPAIGN TO GET

12:40.560 --> 12:47.567
YOU OUT, BUT IF HE'S SITTING
NEXT TO HIS PAL, THEN HE'S NOT.

12:47.600 --> 12:57.644
I'M GOING TO WALK BEFORE THIS
LOOKS WEIRD.

12:57.644 --> 13:05.853
I'M GOING TO WALK BEFORE THIS
LOOKS WEIRD.

13:05.886 --> 13:07.287
>> WHAT IS THIS?

13:07.320 --> 13:09.589
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

13:09.622 --> 13:18.331
WHAT HAPPENED?

13:18.365 --> 13:23.003
>> PAUL HAS OUR BACK 100%, BUT
HE'S WORKING HIS END OVER JURY,

13:23.036 --> 13:24.237
TOO.

13:24.271 --> 13:31.078
I WALK IN HERE, AND JASON GOES,
SO I'M HEARING THE RUMOR THAT

13:31.111 --> 13:36.249
YOU HAVE AN ALLIANCE WITH
CHRISTMAS.

13:36.283 --> 13:39.953
I'M LIKE, NEW YORK I HAVE A
FRIENDSHIP WITH HER, LIKE WE ALL

13:39.987 --> 13:43.556
DO, BUT THAT'S HOW WE'RE WORKING
AN ANGLE.

13:43.590 --> 13:48.095
AND THEN HE'S TELLING HIM THAT
HE'S GOING TO GET BACK DOORED.

13:48.128 --> 13:51.098
I'M LOOKING AT MY MAN PAUL, AND
THIS GUY HAS PLAYED THE BEST

13:51.131 --> 13:56.369
GAME I'VE SEEN THIS SEASON.

13:56.403 --> 13:59.873
HE'S PLAYING COMPARABLE TO
INSPECTOR RUSSO, JERRY FROM

13:59.907 --> 14:00.773
SEASON 16.

14:00.807 --> 14:04.211
I MIGHT BE JUMPING THE GUN, BUT
EVEN DAN.

14:04.244 --> 14:07.547
I HAVE TO LET MY GIRL CHRISTMAS
KNOW THAT WE GOT TO KEEP OUR EYE

14:07.580 --> 14:08.481
ON HIM.

14:08.515 --> 14:14.521
>> OUR AGENDA IS TO SPLIT UP
JASON AND ALEX.

14:14.554 --> 14:21.861
SO IF I VOTE WITH YOU TO VOTE
JASON OUT, IF SHE WINS H.O.H.,

14:21.895 --> 14:25.132
SHE'S GOING TO PUT YOU AND ME ON
THE BLOCK, AND ONE OF US IS

14:25.165 --> 14:26.333
GOING TO GO.

14:26.366 --> 14:29.536
SO THAT WHOLE ANGLE THAT HE
WANTS TO WORK PROTECTS HIM, BUT

14:29.569 --> 14:31.905
DOES IT PROTECT THE THREE OF US?

14:31.939 --> 14:32.705
NO, IT DOESN'T.

14:32.739 --> 14:33.706
IT ONLY PROTECTS PAUL.

14:33.740 --> 14:36.143
>> I'M GETTING PISSED OFF RIGHT
NOW.

14:36.176 --> 14:38.811
YOU NEED TO SHUT YOUR MOUTH AND
STOP SAYING THAT.

14:38.845 --> 14:39.913
>> JUST HEAR MY VOICE.

14:39.947 --> 14:41.381
>> OKAY.

14:41.414 --> 14:42.482
I HEARD IT.

14:42.515 --> 14:45.418
BUT IF YOU KEEP PREACHING,
SOMEONE IS GOING TO HEAR IT.

14:45.452 --> 14:50.223
>> JOSH DOES HAVE A POINT, TO
GET TO FINAL TWO REALISTICALLY,

14:50.257 --> 14:51.524
I NEED PAUL AND JOSH.

14:51.558 --> 14:55.495
THEY CAN STILL GO HEAD TO HEAD,
BUT I CAN'T DO THAT IN

14:55.528 --> 14:56.729
COMPETITIONS.

14:56.763 --> 14:59.466
I WOULD RATHER TAKE MORE OF THE
BLOODSHED SOCIALLY, BECAUSE I

14:59.499 --> 15:04.737
KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO
GET ME FURTHER PHYSICALLY.

15:04.771 --> 15:07.540
>> I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF I'M
GOING THE MAKE IT THAT FAR.

15:07.574 --> 15:10.010
>> IF I MAKE IT THAT FAR, YOU'RE
MAKING THAT IT FAR.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.878
>> BEFORE I CAME INTO THIS
HOUSE, I SAID I WAS GOING TO

15:11.911 --> 15:14.881
PAUL HAS PLAYED THE BEST GAME
THIS SEASON, BUT I'M GOING TO DO

15:14.914 --> 15:17.184
WHATEVER IT TAKES TO WIN, SO IF
I HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE

15:17.217 --> 15:19.386
THE SHOT, I'M GOING TO TAKE IT.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.421
JUST FOCUS ON VETO.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.900
>> HEY, EVERYONE, IT'S TIME TO
PICK PLAYERS FOR THE VETO

15:33.933 --> 15:36.003
COMPETITION.

15:36.036 --> 15:38.271
>> YAY.

15:38.305 --> 15:42.142
>> FINALLY.

15:42.175 --> 15:44.411
>> ONLY SIX PEOPLE WILL
PARTICIPATE IN THE VETO

15:44.444 --> 15:47.047
COMPETITION, THE HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD, THE TWO NOMINEES, AND

15:47.080 --> 15:49.216
THREE OTHERS PLAYERS SELECTED BY
RANDOM DRAW.

15:49.249 --> 15:54.321
WILL THE NOMINEES PLEASE JOIN ME
UP HERE.

15:54.354 --> 15:57.157
WE'RE DOWN TO SEVEN PEOPLE,
WHICH MEANS EVERYBODY EXCEPT FOR

15:57.190 --> 15:58.658
ONE PLAYS THIS COMPETITION.

15:58.691 --> 16:01.861
AND I'M HOPING THAT KEVIN
DOESN'T GET PICKED, BECAUSE IF

16:01.894 --> 16:05.498
HE IS PICKED AND WINS, THEN HE
COULD POTENTIALLY PULL JASON OFF

16:05.532 --> 16:09.436
THE BLOCK, AND HE WOO RIBS ME
GETTING OUT MY NUMBER-ONE

16:09.469 --> 16:10.070
TARGET.

16:10.103 --> 16:18.411
AS H.O.H., I'LL PICK FIRST.

16:18.445 --> 16:21.281
KEVIN.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.850
>> I CAN'T WAIT TO PLAY THIS
POV.

16:23.883 --> 16:26.453
I WANT TO WIN IT TO MAKE SURE
I'M SAFE.

16:26.486 --> 16:34.261
LET SOMEONE ELSE GO HOME THIS
WEEK.

16:34.294 --> 16:42.435
>> RAVEN.

16:42.469 --> 16:49.276
>> HOUSEGUEST'S CHOICE.

16:49.309 --> 16:50.510
I PICK PAUL.

16:50.543 --> 16:54.247
EVEN THOUGH I HAVE MY DOUBTS, I
PICKED PAUL THE PLAY THE VETO

16:54.281 --> 16:56.483
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY I TRUST HIM
MORE THAN I TRUST JUSTIN BOURKE,

16:56.516 --> 17:00.153
AND IF HE WINS THE POWER OF
VETO, I'M HOPING HE WILL PULL ME

17:00.187 --> 17:02.689
OR ALEC OFF THE BLOCK.

17:02.722 --> 17:06.459
>> "BIG BROTHER" WILL INFORM US
WHEN THE COMPETITION IS TO

17:06.493 --> 17:06.826
BEGIN.

17:06.859 --> 17:12.999
GOOD LUCK.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.602
>> HEY, EVERYBODY, IT'S TIME FOR
THE VETO COMPETITION.

17:15.635 --> 17:20.773
LET'S GATHER IN THE LIVING ROOM.

17:20.807 --> 17:24.411
THE POWER OF VETO IS BACK UP FOR
GRABS, BUT THERE IS MORE AT

17:24.444 --> 17:26.679
STAKE THAN JUST THE VETO IN THIS
COMPETITION.

17:26.713 --> 17:29.316
THE WINNER WILL ALSO GET A ONCE
IN

17:29.349 --> 17:33.186

SCENES EXPERIENCE ON CBS'S NEW

17:33.220 --> 17:38.458

BEFORE I GIVE YOU THE DETAILS,

17:40.160 --> 17:42.462
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

17:42.495 --> 17:45.798

REINVENT IT.

18:03.150 --> 18:04.817
TURNS OUT YOU CAN'T.

18:04.851 --> 18:08.521
HEY, IT'S BEEN FATHER SINCE MY
LAST CONFESSION BECAUSE I'M NOT

18:08.555 --> 18:09.189

I'VE BEEN WHDHING HIM ON "SNL."

19:04.211 --> 19:07.447

YOU'RE A VERY GOOD STORYTELLER.

20:01.968 --> 20:05.272
>> THE MOST SURPRISING
HOUSEGUEST FOR ME TO MEET MIGHT

20:27.694 --> 20:30.497
FIRST THING YOU HAVE TO SEE,
EVERYONE THAT COMES IN THE

HOUSE, THE SECOND I MET RAVEN
SHE SHOWED ME HER PACEMAKER WITH

20:34.834 --> 20:35.201
HANDSHAKE.

20:35.234 --> 20:36.369
>> ALL RIGHT.

20:36.403 --> 20:39.572
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SHOW
ONLY EIGHT OF THESE WERE GIVEN

20:39.606 --> 20:43.142
OUT, SO YOU GET TO HAVE ONE,
PAL.

20:43.175 --> 20:45.312
>> IN WAY!

20:45.345 --> 20:46.846
>> NOW THAT'S FRIENDSHIP.

20:46.879 --> 20:53.520
>> THIS IS... THIS IS THE
GREATEST GIFT I'VE EVER BEEN

20:53.553 --> 20:55.221
GIVEN.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.824
THIS FRIENDSHIP BRACELET IS
GOING TO REMIND ME THAT IF YOU

20:57.857 --> 21:03.129
WORK HARD ENOUGH IN YOUR LIFE
THAT DREAMS CAN COME TRUE COMING

21:03.162 --> 21:04.364
INTO THE "BIG BROTHER" HOUSE.

21:04.397 --> 21:07.734
IT'S ALSO GOING TO REMIND ME
THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE IDIOTS AND

21:07.767 --> 21:10.937
SHOULD HAVE GOT PAUL OUT EASILY
WEEK ONE.

21:10.970 --> 21:12.171
THANK YOU FOR THE TOUR.

21:12.204 --> 21:13.406
THANK YOU FOR THE FRIENDSHIP.

21:13.440 --> 21:16.075
I THINK IT'S VETO TIME.

SO LET'S GET CHANGED AND I WILL

21:17.844 --> 21:21.180

NEVER SEEN A TV STAR UP CLOSE IN

21:24.851 --> 21:25.485
PERSON.

21:25.518 --> 21:29.889
IT WAS THE MOST AMAZING THING.

21:29.922 --> 21:33.993
BUT FIRST THINGS FIRST, I NEED
TO MAKE DAMN SURE THAT I SECURE

21:34.026 --> 21:36.028

24:39.746 --> 24:41.380
>> ZING.

24:41.413 --> 24:46.452
BOBBY, THESE BOOTS WERE MADE FOR
KICKING... YOUR BUTT.

24:46.485 --> 24:47.920
WHICH ACTION HAPPENED FOUR
TIMES?

24:47.954 --> 24:51.223
>> IN ORDER FOR ME TO REMEMBER
WHICH WAY I'M GETTING BEAT UP,

24:51.257 --> 24:57.163
I'M MAKING A MINISONG IN MY
HEAD.

24:57.196 --> 25:01.968
SLAP, PUNCH, KICK, SLAP, PUNCH,
KICK, SLAP.

25:02.001 --> 25:06.038
>> GO AHEAD AND LOCK IN YOU
ANSWERS.

25:06.072 --> 25:15.848
>> THE CORRECT ANSWER WAS PUNCH.

25:15.882 --> 25:18.384
THAT MEANS EVERYONE GETS A POINT
BUT JASON.

25:18.417 --> 25:20.486
I'M SORRY, JASON.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.088
>> THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

25:22.121 --> 25:22.955
>> ALL RIGHT.

25:22.989 --> 25:25.391
HERE'S SEQUENCE NUMBER TWO.

25:25.424 --> 25:35.467
I FEEL I'M DOING THIS IN MY "BIG
BROTHER" HOSTING VOICE.

25:35.467 --> 25:41.874
I FEEL I'M DOING THIS IN MY "BIG
BROTHER" HOSTING VOICE.

25:41.908 --> 25:44.310
WHAT HAPPENED RIGHT BEFORE THE
KICK?

25:44.343 --> 25:47.847
>> SO I'M TRYING TO COUNT ON MY
RIGHT HAND FOR THE PUNCHES,

25:47.880 --> 25:50.983
COUNT ON THE LEFT HAND WITH THE
SLAPS.

25:51.017 --> 25:51.684
THAT STRATEGY SUCKS.

25:51.718 --> 25:54.320
LET'S HOPE ANY GUT IS CORRECT.

25:54.353 --> 25:57.924
>> I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER THE
SEQUENCES AS BEST I CAN, BUT

25:57.957 --> 26:02.328
I'VE BEEN PUNCHED, KICKED,
SLAPPED SO MUCH, I'M

26:02.361 --> 26:07.767
DISCOMBOBULATED.

26:07.800 --> 26:11.671
THE CORRECT ANSWER WAS PUNCH.

26:11.704 --> 26:15.775
WHICH MEANS ALEX, PAUL, AND
RAVEN GET A POINT.

26:15.808 --> 26:18.044
>> I DOUBT MY INSTINCTS.

26:18.077 --> 26:22.982
>> CURRENTLY WE HAVE A THREE-WAY
TIE FOR THE FIRST WITH ALEX,

26:23.015 --> 26:23.916
RAVEN AND PAUL.

26:23.950 --> 26:26.552
>> PAUL, ALEX, AND RAVEN ARE UP
TWO POINTS.

26:26.585 --> 26:27.787
I'M HAVING FAT ZERO.

26:27.820 --> 26:31.157
I'M HAVING TO DOUBLE FOCUS.

26:31.190 --> 26:32.892
I'M GETTING KICKED IN MY WHISTLE
BUTT.

26:32.925 --> 26:45.972
>> HERE COMES SEQUENCE NUMBER
THREE.

26:46.005 --> 26:54.681
>> POOR ALEX.

26:54.714 --> 26:57.583
>> IT'S FUN TO WATCH YOUR
FRIENDS GET SLAPPED.

26:57.616 --> 27:04.523
DON'T TURN AROUND.

27:04.556 --> 27:08.761
>> WHICH ACTION HAPPENED THE
FEWEST TIMES?

27:08.795 --> 27:14.633
THE CORRECT ANSWER IS SLAP.

27:14.667 --> 27:16.402
WHICH MEANS RAVEN TAKES THE
LEAD.

27:16.435 --> 27:20.039
>> JASON PUT MATT AND RAVEN ON
THE BLOCK LAST WEEKEND AND SENT

27:20.072 --> 27:21.307
MATT HOME.

27:21.340 --> 27:24.711
I SURE AS HELL DON'T WANT HER TO
WIN THAT VETO, SO I HAVE TO KICK

27:24.744 --> 27:26.578
IT INTO GEAR AND BEAT THAT B.

27:26.612 --> 27:28.815
>> ARE YOU GUYS READY FOR THE
FOURTH SEQUENCE?

27:28.848 --> 27:29.381
>> NO.

27:29.415 --> 27:30.082
>> YES.

27:30.116 --> 27:41.227
>> HERE IT COMES.

27:47.066 --> 27:51.270
>> WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THE
FOURTH PUNCH?

27:51.303 --> 28:00.379
THE CORRECT ANSWER WAS KICK.

28:00.412 --> 28:02.815
EVERYONE GETS A POINT EXCEPT FOR
RAVEN.

28:02.849 --> 28:03.950
SORRY, RAVEN.

>> I DON'T THINK THERE'S ENOUGH
TIME IN THIS ROUND TO COME BACK.

28:21.433 --> 28:24.536
I'M JUST CROSSING MY FINGERS NOW
THAT ALEX BRINGS HOME THE WIN.

28:24.570 --> 28:26.238

WHICH ACTION HAPPENED THE FEWEST

29:51.690 --> 29:59.331
LOCK IN YOUR ANSWERS.

29:59.365 --> 30:03.069
THE CORRECT ANSWER WAS PUNCH.

30:03.102 --> 30:05.237
EVERYBODY GETS IT RIGHT BUT
RAVEN.

30:05.271 --> 30:12.678

30:23.189 --> 30:26.825
>> SO NOW IT'S DOWN TO PAUL AND
I, AND I'M THINKING, AM I

30:26.859 --> 30:29.395
SUPPOSED TO THROW THIS OR AM I

30:29.428 --> 30:32.965
I LOOK OVER AT JASON.

30:32.999 --> 30:33.732

30:38.070 --> 30:40.106
AND JASON GIVES ME A BIG
THUMBS-UP.

30:40.139 --> 30:40.706
OKAY.

30:40.739 --> 30:41.607
I'M NOT THROWING THIS.

30:41.640 --> 30:43.075
I'M GOING TO GO FOR THE WIN.

30:43.109 --> 30:45.411
I'M GOING TO GET THAT VETO.

>> ALL RIGHT.

30:47.013 --> 30:49.015
HERE'S YOUR FIRST TIEBREAKER
SEQUENCE.

31:04.496 --> 31:08.134
WHAT WAS THE TENTH ACTION THAT
HAPPENED TO YOU?

31:08.167 --> 31:10.302
THE CORRECT ANSWER IS PUNCH.

31:10.336 --> 31:11.403
YOU BOTH GOT IT RIGHT.

31:20.112 --> 31:21.647
>> OH, MY GOD.

31:21.680 --> 31:22.814
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

31:22.848 --> 31:25.317
>> WOW.

31:25.351 --> 31:32.591
TIME FOR A THIRD TIEBREAKER
SEQUENCE.

31:32.624 --> 31:33.825
SORRY, YOU'RE BOTH WRONG.

31:33.859 --> 31:37.829
>> SO ROUND AFTER ROUND,
LITERALLY I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT'S

31:37.863 --> 31:39.999
HAPPENING, WHEN I GET A QUESTION
WRONG, PAUL GETS A QUESTION

31:40.032 --> 31:40.299
WRONG.

31:40.332 --> 31:40.899
>> WHAT?

31:40.933 --> 31:42.268
>> WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?

31:42.301 --> 31:45.504
WHEN I GET A QUESTION RIGHT,
PAUL GETS A QUESTION RIGHT.

31:45.537 --> 31:47.139
I CAN'T FREAKIN' WIN.

31:47.173 --> 31:52.111
>> LOOK, ALEX, WHAT PART OF HAVE
ME WIN DID WE NOT MAKE CLEAR

31:52.144 --> 31:53.379
HERE?

31:53.412 --> 31:57.349
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE A SAY DO
MASOCHIST, BUT I'M OVER GETTING

31:57.383 --> 31:58.484
KICKED, PUNCHED, AND SLAPPED.

31:58.517 --> 32:00.987
>> AS FAN, THIS IS AWESOME.

32:01.020 --> 32:03.422
WHO IS READY FOR ANOTHER
TIEBREAKER SEQUENCE?

32:03.455 --> 32:06.258
>> I KNOW I AM.

32:06.292 --> 32:15.567
>> OH, BOY.

32:15.601 --> 32:17.503
WHAT WAS THE SIXTH ACTION IN THE
SEQUENCE?

32:17.536 --> 32:21.173
PLEASE LOCK IN YOUR ANSWER.

32:21.207 --> 32:24.476
LOOKS LIKE ALEX HAS ANSWERED
SLAP AND PAUL HAS ANSWERED

32:24.510 --> 32:27.679
PUNCH.

32:27.713 --> 32:40.559
THE SIXTH ACTION IN THE SEQUENCE
WAS... PUNCH.

32:40.592 --> 32:43.929
PAUL, YOU HAVE WON THE GOLDEN
POWER OF VETO.

32:43.962 --> 32:45.064
>> YEAH, FRIENDSHIP.

32:45.097 --> 32:46.265
>> FRIENDSHIP.

32:46.298 --> 32:48.367
>> THAT'S AWESOME, DUDE.

32:48.400 --> 32:51.837
>> I JUST DON'T THINK I'LL BE
SLEEPING AS WELL KNOWING THAT

32:51.870 --> 32:55.074
THAT VETO IS NOT HANGING AROUND
MY NECK OR ALEX'S NECK.

32:55.107 --> 32:57.176
I TRUST PAUL, BUT IT IS "BIG
BROTHER."

32:57.209 --> 32:59.211
YOU JUST NEVER KNOW WHAT COULD
POSSIBLY HAPPEN.

32:59.245 --> 33:01.113
>> GOOD JOB, YOU TWO.

33:01.147 --> 33:06.418
>> SO I FINALLY GET KNOCKED OUT,
BUT NOW THAT PAUL WINS HE CAN

33:06.452 --> 33:09.788
PULL EITHER ME OR JASON OFF THE
BLOCK AND WE CAN REPLACE HIM

33:09.821 --> 33:11.357
WITH KEVIN AND SEND KEVIN
PACKING.

33:11.390 --> 33:13.292
>> SUCH A PLEASURE, DUDE.

33:13.325 --> 33:17.829
>> LOOKS LIKE ALL THOSE BEATINGS
WERE WORTH IT, THANKS TO ME,

33:17.863 --> 33:21.600
MYSELF & I, I HAVE THE VETO AND
I GET TO SPLIT UP ANOTHER PAIR

33:21.633 --> 33:23.635
IN THE HOUSE, JASON AND ALEX.

33:31.009 --> 33:31.377
>> HOLA.

33:31.410 --> 33:32.978
>> WHAT'S UP?

33:33.011 --> 33:33.545
>> YOU'RE GOING TO KILL ME.

33:33.579 --> 33:34.046
>> WHY?

33:34.080 --> 33:38.150
>> HEAR ME OUT.

33:38.184 --> 33:40.986
WOULD YOU CONSIDER NOT USING THE
VETO?

33:41.019 --> 33:45.757
>> I KNOW THAT PAUL'S PLAN WAS
TO WIN THE VETO AND PULL ALEX

33:45.791 --> 33:46.958
OFF THE BLOCK.

33:46.992 --> 33:50.196
TO BE HONEST, THAT GETS MORE
BLOOD ON ME AND CHRISTMAS' HANDS

33:50.229 --> 33:52.798
AND WE LOOK LIKE THE VILLAINS
AND HE COMES OUT LOOKING LIKE

33:52.831 --> 33:54.032
THE HERO.

33:54.066 --> 33:56.902
NOW THAT PAUL HAS THE HERO, I
HAVE TO TRY TO CONVINCE HIM NOT

33:56.935 --> 33:58.070
THE USE IT.

33:58.104 --> 34:03.209
>> IF YOU DON'T USE IT, IT
EXPOSES YOU OR PUTS A TARGET ON

34:03.242 --> 34:06.712
YOUR BACK.

34:06.745 --> 34:11.283
YOUR PLAN IS BRILLIANT, BUT IS
IT THE SMARTEST FOR THE THREE OF

34:11.317 --> 34:12.518
US, NO?

34:12.551 --> 34:17.623
YOU CAN BE LIKE, DUDE, I REALLY
WANTED TO, I REALLY WANTED TO,

34:17.656 --> 34:19.625
BUT SHE TOLD ME NOT TO.

34:19.658 --> 34:22.328
THIS IS HOW I THINK IT PROTECTS
ALL THREE OF US.

34:22.361 --> 34:27.833
>> YOU MIGHT THINK THAT ME NOT
USING THE VETO IS THE BEST-CASE

34:27.866 --> 34:30.869
SCENARIO FOR ALL THREE OF US,
BUT I'M STILL PLAYING FOR ME, SO

34:30.902 --> 34:33.239
I'M GOING TO GO WITH PLAN "A."

34:33.272 --> 34:35.073
>> I'M VOTING JASON OUT.

34:35.107 --> 34:39.578
>> HOW DOES THAT PROTECT ALL
THREE OF US?

34:39.611 --> 34:41.347
>> I DON'T CARE WHO YOU'RE
TALKING TO.

34:41.380 --> 34:45.284
>> I WAS TALKING ABOUT TATTOOS,
AN HE WAS ASKING... I SAID

34:45.317 --> 34:48.687
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT TOES, AND
HE WAS BEING... HOW WOULD YOU

34:48.720 --> 34:50.856
KNOW?

34:50.889 --> 34:51.723
HOW MANY TIMES...

34:51.757 --> 35:02.501
>> SHUT UP.

35:02.534 --> 35:08.174
>> HOW ARE YOU?

35:08.207 --> 35:12.444
>> WHY ARE YOU SO DOWN?

35:12.478 --> 35:15.113
>> LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING?

35:15.147 --> 35:20.652
WHAT DO YOU THINK PAUL'S PECKING
ORDER IS?

35:20.686 --> 35:32.231
>> ALEX, RAVEN, KEVIN.

35:32.264 --> 35:35.701
>> JOSH, THE THREE OF US WORKING
TOGETHER IS TO ALL OF OUR

35:35.734 --> 35:43.275
BENEFIT.

35:43.309 --> 35:44.676
>> I'M GOING TO GO NOW.

35:44.710 --> 35:46.278
>> NO, NO.

35:46.312 --> 35:56.655
JOSH, JOSH.

35:56.688 --> 35:59.525
>> WHAT THE HECK, JOSH?

35:59.558 --> 36:03.862
WE'RE IN A CONVERSATION ABOUT
OUR GAME STRATEGY TO GET TO THE

36:03.895 --> 36:06.998
TOP THREE AND THEN YOU'RE GOING
TO WALK AWAY FROM ME WHEN I'M

36:07.032 --> 36:08.634
TRYING TO HELP YOU FIND A
SOLUTION?

36:08.667 --> 36:09.601
>> WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

36:09.635 --> 36:10.702
>> I AM YOUR FRIEND.

36:10.736 --> 36:14.072
I AM YOUR TEAMMATE, AND I AM
YOUR PARTNER IN THIS GAME.

36:14.105 --> 36:18.210
THIS IS TWO SIDED, BUDDY, SO
DON'T COME TO ME WITH A PROBLEM

36:18.244 --> 36:21.347
AND THEN DIP OUT WHEN I'M TRYING
TO HELP YOU FIND THE SOLUTION.

36:21.380 --> 36:24.182
>>HAVE A SEAT.

36:24.216 --> 36:27.386
DON'T WALK AWAY FROM ME AGAIN
WHEN WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

36:27.419 --> 36:28.554
CONVERSATION.

36:28.587 --> 36:32.157
I AM NOT ONE OF THESE LITTLE
CLUB WHORES THAT YOU CAN TREAT

36:32.190 --> 36:33.325
LIKE THAT.

36:33.359 --> 36:36.061
I AM A GROWN-UP WOMAN AND YOU
WILL NOT TREAT ME LIKE THAT.

36:36.094 --> 36:37.363
DO NOT INTERRUPT ME.

36:37.396 --> 36:39.398
WE CAN HAVE CONVERSATIONS.

36:39.431 --> 36:40.732
WE HAVE K HAVE DISCUSSIONS.

36:40.766 --> 36:43.302
WE CAN HAVE ARGUMENTS.

36:43.335 --> 36:48.340
YOU WALK AWAY FROM ME, NOT COOL.

36:48.374 --> 36:48.940
>> OKAY.

36:48.974 --> 36:49.508
DEAL.

36:49.541 --> 36:54.546
>> DON'T DO THAT AGAIN.

36:54.580 --> 36:56.648
>> WHAT DID YOU DO IN
>> HE KNOWS.

36:56.682 --> 36:57.716
YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW.

36:57.749 --> 37:00.919
>> TO BE HONEST I'M REALLY
FRUSTRATED AT THIS POINT.

37:00.952 --> 37:05.123
PAUL HAS HIS PLAN AN HIS AGENDA,
AND I'M SEEING THAT SOMEBODY

37:05.156 --> 37:07.459
BENEFITS FROM IT, SO IT'S NOT ME
OR CHRISTMAS.

37:07.493 --> 37:10.362
SO DON'T TELL ME I'M TRIPPING
AND I NEED TO SIT BECOME AND

37:10.396 --> 37:11.497
RELAX.

37:11.530 --> 37:13.599
NO, I THINK THIS WHOLE PLAN
NEEDS TO TAKE A SEAT IN THE

37:13.632 --> 37:16.768
CORNER AND RELAX, NOT ME.

37:16.802 --> 37:31.550
>> WHAT DID YOU DO?

37:31.583 --> 37:32.351
>> OKAY.

37:32.384 --> 37:33.151
CAN I SAY SOMETHING?

37:33.184 --> 37:34.019
>> SAY IT.

37:34.052 --> 37:35.487
>> BECAUSE IT'S PISSING ME OFF.

37:35.521 --> 37:38.624
>> I'M TRYING TO HAVE ONE LAST
ATTEMPT WITH THESE TWO TO HAVE

37:38.657 --> 37:41.360
IT CLICK IN THEIR MINDS THAT
USING THE VETO IS NOT WHAT'S

37:41.393 --> 37:42.694
BEST FOR THE THREE OF US.

37:42.728 --> 37:44.630
IT'S IN THE A TEAM MOVE, IT'S A
PAUL MOVE.

37:44.663 --> 37:48.634
>> JUST HEAR ME OUT WHERE I'M
COMING FROM.

37:48.667 --> 37:50.436
WE'RE LOCKED IN, RIGHT?

37:50.469 --> 37:52.938
WE'RE GOING TO GO WITH WHAT YOU
GUYS WANT TO DO.

37:52.971 --> 37:56.007
>> NOT WHAT WE WANT TO DO, IT
SHOULD BE WHAT YOU WANT TO DO,

37:56.041 --> 37:57.242
TOO.

37:57.275 --> 37:59.878
>> THIS IS WHAT I WAS THINKING,
WE DON'T USE THE VETO, RIGHT?

37:59.911 --> 38:04.182
WE DON'T USE THE VETO, BECAUSE
SHE TOLD ALEX THAT SHE WAS A

38:04.215 --> 38:07.419
PAWN, AND SHE TOLD JASON THAT HE
WAS THE TARGET.

38:07.453 --> 38:08.387
SHE DIDN'T LIE.

38:08.420 --> 38:12.157
SHE WAS POINT BANK AND HONEST.

38:12.190 --> 38:18.930
ALSO, YOU HONESTLY DON'T HAVE
ANY BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS.

38:18.964 --> 38:22.568
>> BUT THEN NEXT WEEK WHEN I
TAKE A SHOT AT ALEX I'M NOT

38:22.601 --> 38:23.969
GETTING BLOOD ON MY HANDS?

38:24.002 --> 38:26.405
>> MY WAY WE'RE ALL GOING TO GET
HEAT.

38:26.438 --> 38:29.675
>> AT THIS POINT DO YOU CARE
ABOUT BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS OR DO

38:29.708 --> 38:31.410
YOU CARE ABOUT GETTING TO THE
END OF THIS GAME?

38:31.443 --> 38:34.780
>> JOSH, I PRETTY MUCH CARRIED
YOU THIS ENTIRE WAY THROUGH, LET

38:34.813 --> 38:37.115
ME CALL THE SHOTS AND JUST PLAY
YOUR ROLE.

38:37.148 --> 38:40.519
>> FROM THE MOMENT THAT I
ALIGNED WITH YOU TWO, IT'S

38:40.552 --> 38:46.224
LITERALLY NOT BEEN FOR THE BEST
OF OUR INTERESTS.

38:46.257 --> 38:49.828
I HAVE LITERALLY EXPOSED
PEOPLE'S GAME, BLOWN UP PEOPLE'S

38:49.861 --> 38:50.962
GAMES.

38:50.996 --> 38:53.565
I HAVE BEEN PUTTING THE HEAT ON
OTHER PEOPLE TO PROTECT

38:53.599 --> 38:54.366
CHRISTMAS AND PAUL.

38:54.400 --> 38:56.267
I'VE BEEN PLAYING FOR MY TEAM.

38:56.301 --> 38:58.704
SO THIS MOVE RIGHT HERE, THEY'RE
IN THE HEARING ME OUT, IS

38:58.737 --> 39:00.406
PISSING ME OFF AND IT'S
FRUSTRATING ME.

39:00.439 --> 39:03.542
>> YOU THINK I WANT TO BE
RESPONSIBLE FOR HIP NOT GETTING

39:03.575 --> 39:04.175
FIRST, SECOND?

39:04.209 --> 39:05.343
HE'S GOT A BABY ON THE WAY.

39:05.377 --> 39:08.113
>> IT'S HARD GAME.

39:08.146 --> 39:09.280
TRUST ME.

39:09.314 --> 39:12.017
THIS FAR IN THE GAME, I DON'T
MAKE MISTAKES.

39:12.050 --> 39:15.421
IF I MAKE A MISTAKE, I WILL TAKE
THE HEAT.

39:15.454 --> 39:19.290
>> I KNOW THAT YOU'RE IN A TOUGH
SPACE, BUT WE ALL ARE, WE HAVE

39:19.324 --> 39:20.626
THE SHARE THAT BURDEN.

39:20.659 --> 39:26.632
SO EITHER YOU GET IN HERE AND OR
YOU GET YOUR HEAD IN THE GAME,

39:26.665 --> 39:28.667
TRUST THIS TEAM AND WE GO ALL
THE  WAY.

39:53.391 --> 39:54.660
>> JOSH HAS STRONG OPINIONS
ABOUT ME NOT USING THE VETO, BUT

39:54.693 --> 39:57.429
I'M THE ONE THAT HAS THE VETO,
SO I HAVE THE MAKE A DECISION

39:57.463 --> 40:05.370
THAT'S BEST FOR MY GAME.

40:05.403 --> 40:13.879
>> HEY, EVERYBODY, IT'S TIME FOR
THE VETO VETO MEETING.

40:13.912 --> 40:15.814
THIS IS THE VETO MEETING.

40:15.847 --> 40:18.450
JASON AND ALEX HAVE BEEN UNTIL
INDICATED FOR EVICTION, BUT I

40:18.484 --> 40:23.989
HAVE THE POWER TO VETO ONE OF
THE NOMINATIONS.

40:24.022 --> 40:34.065
I HAVE DECIDED TO USE THE POWER
OF VETO ON ALEX.

40:34.065 --> 40:47.245
I HAVE DECIDED TO USE THE POWER
OF VETO ON ALEX.

40:47.278 --> 40:50.448
CHRISTMAS, SINCE I HAVE JUST
VETOED ONE OF YOUR NOMINATIONS

40:50.482 --> 40:53.652
FOR EVICTION, YOU WILL HAVE TO
NAME A NEW HOUSEGUEST AS A

40:53.685 --> 40:59.257
REPLACEMENT NOMINEE.

40:59.290 --> 41:03.695
>> AS THE TOP SEVEN CURRENTLY,
EVERYBODY HERE HAS BEEN ON THE

41:03.729 --> 41:08.299
BLOCK ONE WAY OR ANOTHER
MULTIPLE TIMES EXCEPT FOR ONE

41:08.333 --> 41:10.235
PERSON.

41:10.268 --> 41:14.472
WITH THAT BEING SAID, KEVIN,
PLEASE TAKE A SEAT.

41:14.506 --> 41:15.306
>> THANK YOU.

41:15.340 --> 41:25.984
THANK YOU.

41:26.017 --> 41:35.661
>> THIS VETO MEETING IS
ADJOURNED.

41:35.694 --> 41:37.796
CHRISTMAS, THAT'S AN INTERESTING
POINT YOU MADE BECAUSE I TOO

41:37.829 --> 41:41.066
HAVE NOT BEEN ON THE BLOCK, BUT
I PLAN TO KEEP IT GOING THAT WAY

41:41.099 --> 41:44.903
UNTIL THE END OF THE GAME SO I
CAN USE IT AS THE ULTIMATE

41:44.936 --> 41:46.404
ARGUMENT.

41:46.437 --> 41:48.306
>> I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
GOING ON.

41:48.339 --> 41:54.813
I DID EVERYTHING I WAS ASKED TO
DO, AND THEN I GET RAILROAD.

41:54.846 --> 42:03.689
EVERYONE DIDN'T JUMP THE GUN ON
THAT TRACK MEET AND A GIRL IN

42:03.722 --> 42:05.857
CRUTCHES WON.

42:05.891 --> 42:07.425
I SHOULD HAVE USED MY HEAD.

42:07.458 --> 42:18.203
IF THEY LEAVE ME IN THE GAME,
NEXT TIME I WON'T LISTEN TO

42:18.236 --> 42:18.904
NOBODY.

42:18.937 --> 42:22.340
>> I WAS WORRIED FOR EVERYBODY.

42:22.373 --> 42:27.378
KEVIN, I LIKE WALKING THAT YARD
WITH YOU, BUT I'M IN THE WALKING

42:27.412 --> 42:28.647
OUT THE DOOR FOR YOU.

42:28.680 --> 42:31.783
>> IF JASON WALKS OUT THAT DOOR,
ME AND CHRISTMAS ARE GOING TO BE

42:31.817 --> 42:32.951
BATHED IN BLOOD.

42:32.984 --> 42:35.020
PAUL IS LOOKING OUT FOR HIS
GAME, BUT MAYBE I'LL JUST LOOK

42:35.053 --> 42:37.488
OUT FOR MY GAME THIS WEEK AND
CHANGE THINGS UP A BIT.

42:37.522 --> 42:42.293
>> WHO WILL BE EVICTED FROM THE
"BIG BROTHER" HOUSE, JASON OR

42:42.327 --> 42:43.428
KEVIN?

42:43.461 --> 42:45.631
PLUS CALL YOUR FRIENDS, TELL
YOUR NEIGHBORS, BECAUSE IT'S

42:45.664 --> 42:48.433
TIME FOR ANOTHER DOUBLE
EVICTION.

42:48.466 --> 42:52.470
THAT'S RIGHT, A WEEK'S WORTH OF
"BIG BROTHER" ALL IN ONE NIGHT

42:52.503 --> 42:58.443
LIVE THURSDAY AT 9:00, 8:00
CENTRAL.
