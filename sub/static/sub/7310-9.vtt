00:03.348 --> 00:05.471
In the land
of forensic-science technology,

00:05.658 --> 00:08.029
the mass spectrometer is king.

00:08.202 --> 00:11.239
It uses the basic magnetic force
of a charged particle

00:11.414 --> 00:15.625
to measure the mass and relative
concentration of atoms and molecules.

00:15.793 --> 00:16.873
Pretty cool, huh?

00:17.045 --> 00:18.455
Are those tattoos real?

00:18.630 --> 00:20.456
Sweet.

00:21.049 --> 00:23.088
Yes, any other questions?

00:23.259 --> 00:25.797
- How many do you have?
- A lot.

00:26.471 --> 00:28.013
That's all I'm gonna say about that.

00:28.181 --> 00:30.138
A lot? I only counted five.

00:30.308 --> 00:33.808
The rest of them are hidden.

00:33.979 --> 00:35.687
Hidden where?

00:35.856 --> 00:37.480
- They're...
- Hi, guys.

00:37.649 --> 00:39.143
- Hey. Hi.
- What did I miss?

00:39.317 --> 00:41.559
Nothing yet.
Abby was just about to show us her...

00:41.737 --> 00:44.310
AFIS programme, right...?

00:45.157 --> 00:47.315
- Carson?
- Right.

00:47.492 --> 00:50.826
So if the mass spectrometer
is the king of the land,

00:50.996 --> 00:52.870
this little darling
is definitely the queen.

00:53.040 --> 00:55.827
In the last four years,
we've made over 200 arrests,

00:56.001 --> 00:57.661
thanks to AFIS fingerprint matches.

00:57.836 --> 01:00.162
- We.
- It's a team effort.

01:00.339 --> 01:02.082
So this is an I SCAN.

01:02.257 --> 01:05.093
All you do is put your index finger
on the glass and...

01:06.345 --> 01:08.918
- VoilÄ…, you're in the system.
- Cool.

01:09.098 --> 01:11.968
As we speak, the programme
is filtering through a database

01:12.143 --> 01:13.518
filled with millions of prints.

01:13.686 --> 01:16.011
The majority of them were recorded
after somebody's arrest.

01:16.188 --> 01:18.810
So assuming that you haven't served
any hard time,

01:18.983 --> 01:20.607
I doubt we're gonna get...

02:07.449 --> 02:09.572
Where is Gibbs?
It's been, like, 20 minutes.

02:09.743 --> 02:11.985
Abby, it's been, like, four minutes.

02:12.162 --> 02:14.202
In little kid time, that's like 20.

02:14.373 --> 02:15.573
Gibbs will be here any second.

02:19.169 --> 02:21.411
Look at him. He looks so scared.

02:24.717 --> 02:25.997
He seems fine.

02:26.176 --> 02:28.714
If you're gonna be heartless,
that's on you, McGee.

02:29.180 --> 02:30.888
- I'm going in.
- To say what?

02:32.892 --> 02:35.383
Exactly. Like I said,
we need to wait for Gibbs.

02:35.561 --> 02:37.601
Who's Gibbs?

02:38.648 --> 02:41.020
Agent Gibbs. He's our boss.

02:41.943 --> 02:43.188
Am I in trouble?

02:43.361 --> 02:46.030
No, no, no, Carson, not at all.

02:46.197 --> 02:48.949
- What about the AMIS thing?
- AFIS.

02:50.410 --> 02:51.952
Sorry.

02:53.496 --> 02:56.070
You know what?
I'm just gonna go back to work.

03:02.380 --> 03:03.874
Where are the other kids?

03:04.632 --> 03:06.542
The tour ended early.

03:06.718 --> 03:07.963
How am I gonna get home?

03:09.220 --> 03:10.465
We're gonna figure that out.

03:11.306 --> 03:14.722
The computer said I was abducted.

03:15.143 --> 03:17.895
That's like kidnapped, right?

03:18.396 --> 03:21.148
Kidnapped as in stolen?

03:21.316 --> 03:23.190
I'm sure there's some
sort of explanation.

03:23.360 --> 03:25.649
There is. You guys messed up.

03:25.821 --> 03:27.398
Wouldn't be the first time.

03:27.572 --> 03:29.280
Hey. Special Agent Gibbs.

03:29.700 --> 03:31.823
- The boss.
- To some people.

03:35.622 --> 03:37.745
I thought you might be thirsty.

03:38.292 --> 03:40.284
I'm not supposed to drink soda
after 3.

03:42.087 --> 03:47.508
But given the situation,
I think my mom would understand.

03:47.676 --> 03:48.874
Moms usually do.

03:49.053 --> 03:50.796
So?

03:50.971 --> 03:52.715
Have you guys figured
this thing out yet?

03:52.890 --> 03:54.847
Working on it.

03:55.643 --> 03:56.674
It's been a long day.

03:57.853 --> 03:59.453
I know you're looking
to get out of here.

03:59.605 --> 04:01.514
You're right. Who's driving?

04:02.233 --> 04:04.439
Hold on. We're gonna talk first.

04:04.986 --> 04:07.192
I knew that would be too easy.

04:07.655 --> 04:10.490
Before we start,
can I ask you guys a question?

04:10.658 --> 04:11.856
Yeah, shoot.

04:12.368 --> 04:14.195
Do I look like a missing kid?

04:14.996 --> 04:17.036
I mean, come on.
I'm a Youth Ranger.

04:17.832 --> 04:18.863
He's got a good point.

04:19.041 --> 04:22.162
And I'm from Franklin,
which means I can't be missing

04:22.337 --> 04:24.128
because nothing cool
ever happens there.

04:24.297 --> 04:26.290
- That bad, huh?
- Worse.

04:26.466 --> 04:28.874
We only live there
because it's close to the woods.

04:29.052 --> 04:30.546
My dad goes most weekends.

04:31.096 --> 04:32.376
Hunting or camping?

04:32.556 --> 04:33.587
Teaching.

04:33.765 --> 04:36.007
He shows people how to live
without phones, lights,

04:36.184 --> 04:37.215
that kind of stuff.

04:37.394 --> 04:41.392
He's super tough,
like Russell Crowe in Gladiator.

04:41.565 --> 04:42.893
He sounds like a cool dad.

04:43.442 --> 04:45.233
Coolest.

04:45.861 --> 04:47.735
He's taught me pretty much
everything he knows.

04:48.739 --> 04:50.399
That explains all the badges.

04:50.574 --> 04:53.195
Eighteen, second most in my troop.

04:53.368 --> 04:55.694
It took me close to three years.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.823
I bet your dad's
real proud of you.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.078
Yeah.

05:00.250 --> 05:02.124
My mom too.

05:09.051 --> 05:11.756
Is it okay
if I ask one more question?

05:15.057 --> 05:17.513
When can I go home?

05:28.179 --> 05:30.302
This is exactly
like Deep End of the Ocean.

05:30.473 --> 05:31.504
Michelle Pfeiffer movie.

05:31.682 --> 05:33.176
Infant son, kidnapped.

05:33.351 --> 05:35.758
Reunited with the mother
10 years later. It's very Lifetime.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.976
Lifetime?

05:38.356 --> 05:40.977
The cable network
geared towards women.

05:42.318 --> 05:45.687
You'd hate it. Probie,
I don't make enough fun of you?

05:45.863 --> 05:47.655
Knock it off, DiNozzo.

05:47.824 --> 05:49.863
All roads lead to the father, boss.

05:50.034 --> 05:51.778
Brian Matthews, a native of D.C.

05:51.953 --> 05:54.526
Married his high school sweetheart,
Lisa, at 19.

05:54.706 --> 05:56.116
Two months later, Carson was born.

05:56.291 --> 05:57.785
Good old shotgun wedding.

05:57.959 --> 05:59.952
Six weeks after giving birth,
Lisa drowned.

06:00.128 --> 06:01.587
Death was ruled accidental.

06:01.755 --> 06:03.379
Brian Matthews took it bad,
lost his job.

06:03.548 --> 06:04.988
Started hanging
with the wrong crowd.

06:05.133 --> 06:08.716
The dead wife's mother sued him
for full custody of Carson, and won.

06:08.887 --> 06:10.879
That explains
why he took Carson and ran.

06:11.056 --> 06:13.179
Somebody just earned
their detective badge.

06:13.350 --> 06:15.473
Did you talk to the grandmother?

06:15.644 --> 06:17.683
No, died. Year ago. Heart attack.

06:18.146 --> 06:20.933
Brian Matthews became Brian Taylor.
Ended up living in Franklin.

06:21.108 --> 06:23.563
- He and Carson started a new life.
- Remarried?

06:23.735 --> 06:26.357
Yes, Lieutenant Elaine Taylor.

06:26.530 --> 06:28.321
Works anti-fraud
for Naval Procurement.

06:28.490 --> 06:29.569
Think she knows?

06:29.741 --> 06:31.983
Well,
there's only one way to find out.

06:32.161 --> 06:33.323
McGee.

06:34.496 --> 06:35.907
Lose the uni.

06:37.374 --> 06:38.916
- Where's the kid?
- Abby's got him.

06:39.084 --> 06:40.579
- Our Abby?
- Alone with a minor?

06:40.753 --> 06:42.876
He'll be fine.

06:57.436 --> 06:59.263
Can I help you?

06:59.438 --> 07:00.897
NCIS.

07:01.065 --> 07:02.440
Oh, my God. Carson.

07:02.608 --> 07:04.103
- What happened?
- Carson's fine.

07:04.277 --> 07:05.771
He's still in D.C.

07:06.654 --> 07:09.062
I don't understand.
What's this about?

07:09.240 --> 07:10.271
Your husband.

07:10.450 --> 07:12.110
He's wanted for kidnapping.

07:14.454 --> 07:16.245
It'd be better if we came inside,
lieutenant.

07:20.919 --> 07:22.746
This is all a big misunderstanding.

07:22.962 --> 07:25.085
We'd rather hear that from Brian.

07:25.256 --> 07:27.249
You will on Tuesday
when he gets back.

07:27.425 --> 07:28.588
Gets back?

07:28.760 --> 07:30.634
He's away teaching a class.

07:30.804 --> 07:32.761
- Where?
- Black Ridge Woods.

07:32.931 --> 07:34.211
Survival class.

07:35.016 --> 07:36.974
Carson mentioned it.

07:37.144 --> 07:40.310
Of course he did.
He's very proud of his father.

07:40.480 --> 07:42.224
Is there any way
to contact your husband?

07:42.399 --> 07:44.724
First rule of survivalism:
No phones, no radios.

07:44.901 --> 07:46.661
So if you wanna talk to Brian
before Tuesday,

07:46.820 --> 07:49.027
you're gonna have to go find him.

07:52.701 --> 07:53.780
Processed Taylor's office,

07:53.952 --> 07:56.740
his files, computer,
maps of Black Ridge.

07:57.539 --> 07:59.532
- What?
- Look around, Tony.

07:59.708 --> 08:00.740
Tell me what you see.

08:02.127 --> 08:07.086
I see Zero Hour!
It's a great flick.

08:13.556 --> 08:15.548
Swimsuit editions.

08:15.725 --> 08:18.346
His dad's been looking for these.

08:19.353 --> 08:20.848
Wait a second.

08:21.772 --> 08:23.682
No.

08:24.484 --> 08:25.682
No.

08:25.860 --> 08:28.944
You know what this is?
This is a red Ferrari GT.

08:29.113 --> 08:30.358
It's just like Magnum.

08:30.531 --> 08:32.654
Yes, just like Magnum.

08:32.825 --> 08:33.857
I can't...

08:34.034 --> 08:35.943
Even the rims are the same.

08:36.120 --> 08:37.448
You're missing the point.

08:37.621 --> 08:39.448
Which is?

08:39.791 --> 08:41.035
The room, Tony.

08:41.208 --> 08:43.366
Does it remind you of someone?

08:43.544 --> 08:45.454
No, not really.

08:45.630 --> 08:48.204
Do you think this comes in a king?

08:49.384 --> 08:51.211
How much do you know
about Brian's past?

08:51.386 --> 08:53.260
I know that he had it rough.

08:53.430 --> 08:56.300
He didn't know his dad
and his mom died when he was 16.

08:56.475 --> 08:57.506
Carson's mother?

08:58.226 --> 08:59.555
You're looking at her.

08:59.978 --> 09:01.805
Biological.

09:03.607 --> 09:05.896
She drowned. That's all I know.

09:06.485 --> 09:07.564
Never been curious?

09:07.736 --> 09:09.396
Brian is a very private person.

09:09.571 --> 09:10.734
He's your husband.

09:10.906 --> 09:14.192
And I'm his wife, not his therapist,
Agent McGee.

09:15.077 --> 09:16.322
How'd you two meet?

09:18.080 --> 09:21.034
I took his class, and hated it.

09:21.458 --> 09:23.418
I thought some time in the woods
would do me good,

09:23.586 --> 09:25.958
sleeping under the stars,
relieve some stress.

09:26.130 --> 09:29.084
- Didn't work, huh?
- I got poison ivy everywhere.

09:29.592 --> 09:30.623
Brian rushed me home.

09:30.801 --> 09:34.217
And a couple of months later,
I moved in with him and Carson.

09:34.388 --> 09:36.464
- I want my son.
- Stepson.

09:36.641 --> 09:38.929
- You never legally adopted him.
- So?

09:39.101 --> 09:41.427
So legally,
we can't release him to you.

09:41.604 --> 09:43.597
This is completely ridiculous.
You can't do this.

09:45.608 --> 09:47.102
What have you done? Where is he?

09:47.276 --> 09:49.020
He's at NCIS for now.

09:49.195 --> 09:50.606
Legal or not, he's my child.

09:50.780 --> 09:54.398
You can't possibly expect for me
to let him stay with some stranger.

09:54.576 --> 09:57.280
That or Social Services.
Your choice, lieutenant.

09:58.997 --> 10:00.871
I need to see him.

10:02.959 --> 10:04.038
Okay.

10:06.755 --> 10:07.953
Soon.

10:11.468 --> 10:12.713
Do you have kids, Agent Gibbs?

10:15.806 --> 10:18.094
No, I don't.

10:18.266 --> 10:19.298
I didn't think so.

10:21.937 --> 10:23.728
Twenty-four hour surveillance
on the house.

10:23.897 --> 10:26.097
If she makes a phone call, McGee,
I wanna know about it.

10:26.233 --> 10:29.104
- What about Carson?
- Hands are tied, Ziva.

10:29.278 --> 10:30.902
You can't just keep him
from his mother.

10:31.071 --> 10:32.649
- Not his mother.
- She raised him.

10:32.823 --> 10:35.065
You want a family reunion, Ziva?

10:35.242 --> 10:36.571
Prove she wasn't involved.

10:38.871 --> 10:41.741
"This 2001 animated film
starred Mike Myers

10:41.916 --> 10:43.410
and spawned two sequels."

10:43.584 --> 10:45.327
What is Shrek?

10:45.503 --> 10:47.127
Starring Cameron Diaz
and Eddie Murphy.

10:47.296 --> 10:48.494
Correct.

10:48.672 --> 10:50.998
Okay. Oscars.

10:52.176 --> 10:53.339
Best Animated Feature.

10:53.511 --> 10:56.346
Nominated
for Best Adapted Screenplay,

10:56.514 --> 10:57.676
but lost to A Beautiful Mind.

10:58.099 --> 10:59.676
Yes.

11:02.937 --> 11:05.095
- Amazing.
- What's amazing?

11:05.273 --> 11:06.993
I'm playing "Box Office Trivia"
with Carson.

11:07.150 --> 11:08.644
And he's got mad skills.

11:11.070 --> 11:13.478
Fifteen hundred points.

11:13.656 --> 11:16.361
New high score.
DiNozzo's reign is over.

11:16.534 --> 11:18.942
Wow, what are you,
some kind of little savant?

11:19.496 --> 11:20.527
Whenever my dad leaves,

11:20.705 --> 11:22.532
my mom and I stay up late
and watch movies.

11:22.707 --> 11:24.700
Tony's record stood
for over two years.

11:25.085 --> 11:27.327
My dad leaves a lot.

11:30.882 --> 11:32.293
Is that my dad's computer?

11:35.220 --> 11:39.514
Yeah.
We had to borrow it for a little bit.

11:40.309 --> 11:41.554
How come?

11:42.019 --> 11:45.185
I just had to look through his stuff,
you know, try to help sort this out.

11:45.355 --> 11:48.356
And while she is doing that,
you and I are gonna hang.

11:48.859 --> 11:49.890
How does that sound, man?

11:50.068 --> 11:51.788
We'll get some pizza,
play some video games,

11:51.945 --> 11:52.977
maybe a movie.

11:53.906 --> 11:55.234
Your mom packed that for you.

11:55.407 --> 11:58.859
And it looked to me like she put
some pretty nice stuff in there.

12:00.704 --> 12:03.030
That is a very nice DVD player.

12:06.460 --> 12:09.912
My mom wouldn't let me bring it
on the bus when I left.

12:10.589 --> 12:12.878
We got in a huge fight.

12:13.342 --> 12:15.750
I left without kissing her goodbye.

12:19.307 --> 12:22.012
You know,
the great thing about moms

12:22.185 --> 12:27.262
is that whatever you do or say,
they always forgive you.

12:32.237 --> 12:33.647
Okay.

12:36.074 --> 12:38.743
- Ready?
- Come on.

12:40.787 --> 12:42.747
All right, what kind of pizza
are we getting here?

13:00.807 --> 13:02.634
Need a signature.

13:03.602 --> 13:04.800
- For?
- Carson Taylor.

13:04.978 --> 13:06.473
Turning him over to Social Services.

13:07.189 --> 13:08.731
What about his stepmother?

13:08.899 --> 13:10.393
No, not his legal guardian.

13:10.567 --> 13:12.477
And way too many
unanswered questions.

13:14.822 --> 13:16.530
- Problem?
- No.

13:16.699 --> 13:20.115
I'm just surprised
that you're not trying to talk me

13:20.286 --> 13:22.492
into letting him stay with someone
from here.

13:22.663 --> 13:24.656
Not an option. We're not babysitters.

13:24.832 --> 13:26.659
So you're turning him over
to child welfare?

13:26.834 --> 13:28.661
No, you are.

13:29.336 --> 13:31.210
As soon as you sign it.

13:34.675 --> 13:36.004
It's late on Friday night.

13:36.177 --> 13:38.798
I mean, who's still hanging around
in Social Services?

13:38.971 --> 13:41.011
Have you got a better idea?

13:42.850 --> 13:44.013
He can stay with me.

13:44.727 --> 13:47.349
- Are you sure?
- No.

13:47.522 --> 13:50.309
But given my options,
it's the decision I'm making.

13:52.026 --> 13:54.517
Okay.
Come meet your new house guest.

13:55.405 --> 13:57.611
Guarantee he's better than the last.

14:00.076 --> 14:01.784
Jethro.

14:02.245 --> 14:04.037
This is a case report,

14:05.248 --> 14:07.953
not a custody transfer.

14:08.335 --> 14:11.122
Must have grabbed the wrong folder.

14:11.296 --> 14:13.336
Go figure.

14:21.723 --> 14:23.218
Looks like we missed the party.

14:23.392 --> 14:25.930
At his age, the party never ends.

14:26.103 --> 14:27.301
Could be a long night.

14:27.479 --> 14:29.057
Not just for you, director.

14:29.231 --> 14:32.102
I lifted Brian Taylor's prints
off his computer and his files.

14:32.276 --> 14:33.735
AFIS got another hit.

14:33.902 --> 14:37.734
They were all over a Beretta used
in an unsolved shooting in May of '98.

14:37.907 --> 14:39.983
The same month Brian
and Carson disappeared.

14:40.826 --> 14:43.531
He's not running
because he kidnapped Carson.

14:43.704 --> 14:46.409
He's running
because he's wanted for murder.

14:58.902 --> 15:00.222
Black Ridge Woods are closed off.

15:00.362 --> 15:03.114
D.C. Metro's cold case files
are already en route.

15:03.824 --> 15:06.196
- En route?
- Offered to hand deliver.

15:06.368 --> 15:07.863
And you agreed?

15:08.037 --> 15:11.203
That's one of the oldest tricks
in the book, the hand delivery, Ziva.

15:11.373 --> 15:14.244
It's Metro's way of making sure
they stay involved in the case.

15:14.418 --> 15:16.909
- You think?
- Why else would they deliver the files?

15:17.088 --> 15:18.997
To see your pretty face, DiNozzo.

15:22.885 --> 15:24.214
It's been a long time.

15:25.179 --> 15:28.679
- Not long enough, Collins.
- Old friends?

15:28.850 --> 15:31.222
Detective Collins
is on Metro's cold-case squad.

15:31.394 --> 15:34.395
He and I worked a couple homicides
back when I was on Baltimore P.D.

15:34.564 --> 15:38.063
- And unfortunately, we're O for two.
- Third time's a charm.

15:38.234 --> 15:41.401
Catch a break,
we'll have this case closed by Monday.

15:41.571 --> 15:43.398
- We.
- Danielle Hamilton.

15:43.573 --> 15:45.566
I'm looking forward
to working with you.

15:47.243 --> 15:50.695
Hey, DiNozzo,
think you can rustle up some coffee?

15:52.082 --> 15:53.161
Sure thing.

15:54.918 --> 15:58.002
- This is not my fault.
- Tell that to Gibbs.

15:58.421 --> 16:00.081
Here's the other one.

16:03.427 --> 16:06.843
- Maybe you can turn it off now.
- What?

16:07.014 --> 16:09.718
I said, maybe you can turn off
the siren now.

16:11.184 --> 16:14.435
You need to turn off the damn siren!

16:19.401 --> 16:20.777
You think that's funny?

16:20.944 --> 16:22.143
Very.

16:22.321 --> 16:23.436
Where to next?

16:25.991 --> 16:27.272
Let's see.

16:27.743 --> 16:31.788
You've seen Autopsy
and you've seen my lab.

16:31.956 --> 16:34.114
You've seen everything.

16:34.291 --> 16:36.617
Not everything.

16:36.794 --> 16:38.952
Forget about the tattoos, okay?

16:39.130 --> 16:40.458
It is not happening.

16:40.631 --> 16:42.458
Come on. Not even a little peek?

16:42.633 --> 16:43.796
Hey, big man.

16:44.635 --> 16:46.130
What's that?

16:49.223 --> 16:50.634
Come to take me home,
Agent Gibbs?

16:54.437 --> 16:56.145
I'm not going home, am I?

16:56.731 --> 16:57.762
Not tonight.

17:00.693 --> 17:02.769
I want my mom.

17:03.321 --> 17:05.894
I mean, she must be worried.

17:07.617 --> 17:09.028
She misses you.

17:09.202 --> 17:10.233
It's Friday night.

17:10.619 --> 17:12.328
Fright night.

17:12.497 --> 17:16.246
We make double fudge s'mores
and watch scary movies.

17:16.417 --> 17:17.449
It sounds nice.

17:18.545 --> 17:20.169
Here. You wanna call her?

17:20.338 --> 17:21.501
Make sure she's doing okay?

17:22.674 --> 17:24.465
She'd like that.

17:29.181 --> 17:31.008
- Hello?
- Hey, Mom.

17:31.183 --> 17:34.303
- It's me.
- Hello, how are you doing?

17:34.478 --> 17:36.305
Yeah, I'm okay. Are you okay?

17:36.480 --> 17:38.852
Yeah, I'm okay.

17:39.024 --> 17:40.269
You know I love you, don't you?

17:41.026 --> 17:42.983
I miss you. I love you too.

17:43.696 --> 17:45.487
Hey,
have you started the s'mores yet?

17:45.656 --> 17:46.687
No, not yet.

17:46.865 --> 17:49.357
Make sure to save some for me.

17:49.535 --> 17:52.702
May 2nd of '98, two assailants
enter the Stop 'N' Go Mart.

17:52.872 --> 17:56.656
Our witnesses described them both
as Caucasian, about 6 foot, a buck 70.

17:56.834 --> 17:58.209
Description matches Brian Taylor.

17:58.377 --> 17:59.658
It matches a lot of people.

17:59.837 --> 18:01.035
Including you, Collins.

18:01.213 --> 18:02.791
Give or take 5 pounds. Maybe 10.

18:03.424 --> 18:06.758
Clerk hands over the cash
without any argument or struggle.

18:06.928 --> 18:09.845
- But that wasn't enough.
- Dead before he hit the floor.

18:10.014 --> 18:12.221
- Motive?
- Thrill, Officer David.

18:12.392 --> 18:14.552
We believe we're dealing
with two cold-blooded killers.

18:14.727 --> 18:16.387
We've been over this case,
it's textbook.

18:16.562 --> 18:17.594
You haven't solved it.

18:17.772 --> 18:19.978
- Some cases take time.
- Nine years.

18:20.441 --> 18:23.015
We've been looking for a lead,
and now we've found it.

18:23.194 --> 18:24.688
We found it.

18:24.863 --> 18:26.902
We have boxes of DNA evidence
from the scene.

18:27.073 --> 18:29.280
- We'll find a match.
- All we need is Brian Taylor.

18:29.451 --> 18:31.823
Good luck finding him.
He's teaching a class in Black Ridge.

18:31.995 --> 18:33.395
Okay,
so we send out a search party.

18:33.538 --> 18:35.745
If he hears us coming,
his students become hostages.

18:35.916 --> 18:36.947
So we just wait?

18:37.125 --> 18:40.245
Yeah, you never were very good
at that, were you, Collins?

18:40.420 --> 18:42.745
Do you still have the highest arrest rate
in your precinct?

18:42.923 --> 18:45.212
- Yeah.
- Still bucking for that captain's job?

18:45.384 --> 18:47.044
- One day.
- Found something.

18:47.594 --> 18:49.919
I filtered through Brian Taylor's
electronic maps.

18:50.097 --> 18:52.255
He keeps a log of all his locations.

18:52.432 --> 18:55.102
Training exercises, rest areas
and most importantly...

18:55.769 --> 18:58.260
- His base camp.
- Seven miles from Highway 9.

18:58.439 --> 18:59.767
We can be there by morning.

18:59.940 --> 19:01.138
- Take Ziva.
- We'll follow.

19:01.317 --> 19:03.393
No, I don't think so, detective.

19:03.819 --> 19:04.934
Here to help, Agent Gibbs.

19:05.112 --> 19:07.603
Good. Let's go over all
that evidence you have.

19:08.199 --> 19:09.278
And then?

19:09.450 --> 19:13.115
And then you can help when I ask.

19:17.958 --> 19:21.292
- Yeah, Gibbs.
- Sorry to call so late, Agent Gibbs.

19:21.462 --> 19:23.253
Hey, Carson, are you okay?

19:23.756 --> 19:26.461
I just remembered a couple of things
I thought you should know.

19:26.968 --> 19:28.296
About my dad.

19:28.469 --> 19:29.963
Be right there.

19:32.098 --> 19:33.806
It looks like
it's just you and me, David.

19:33.975 --> 19:36.976
Nothing more relaxing
than a long road trip.

19:37.145 --> 19:39.932
- I'm driving.
- I'm dead.

19:42.817 --> 19:46.981
I'm surprised it took you so long
to check up on me.

19:50.992 --> 19:53.318
Except that's not why you're here,
is it?

19:57.707 --> 20:00.245
Which explains
where my cell phone went.

20:00.419 --> 20:01.877
Kids.

20:02.629 --> 20:04.289
Jazz.

20:04.840 --> 20:06.583
His favourite.

20:07.509 --> 20:09.502
Ziva was right.

20:09.678 --> 20:11.552
DiNozzo.

20:18.687 --> 20:20.431
You get lost, Agent Gibbs?

20:21.523 --> 20:23.018
I called almost an hour ago.

20:23.192 --> 20:25.861
Well, I'm here now.
You want to tell me why?

20:28.531 --> 20:30.191
You get mad easily?

20:30.616 --> 20:32.158
Depends on who you ask.

20:35.871 --> 20:38.327
I lied, about my dad.

20:40.418 --> 20:41.960
I just wanted you to come over.

20:43.045 --> 20:45.963
- Why?
- To talk.

20:47.008 --> 20:48.336
Okay.

20:49.177 --> 20:51.050
Want me to start?

20:52.513 --> 20:53.889
You're the one with the questions.

20:54.390 --> 20:56.050
Good point.

20:59.854 --> 21:01.811
Why can't I go home?

21:03.066 --> 21:05.438
Because we need time to do our job.

21:06.069 --> 21:08.192
You mean, find my dad?

21:10.573 --> 21:13.740
- You think he did something wrong?
- Not sure yet.

21:14.578 --> 21:16.369
My dad never breaks the rules.

21:16.746 --> 21:18.241
Ever.

21:19.416 --> 21:20.661
This is all my fault.

21:20.834 --> 21:22.827
Me and my stupid field trip.

21:23.003 --> 21:24.082
Carson.

21:24.254 --> 21:25.713
This is not your fault.

21:27.215 --> 21:29.007
It was my fingerprint.

21:31.178 --> 21:33.005
What are you gonna do
when you find him?

21:33.430 --> 21:34.509
Talk.

21:34.681 --> 21:37.173
He'll tell you the truth, Agent Gibbs.

21:38.143 --> 21:40.599
He says telling the truth
is his number-one rule.

21:41.814 --> 21:44.139
Well, he sounds like my kind of guy.

21:44.900 --> 21:46.608
Mine too.

21:48.237 --> 21:49.731
Time for Letterman.

21:49.905 --> 21:51.448
Time for bed.

21:51.615 --> 21:52.944
But I'm not even tired.

21:54.869 --> 21:56.529
Can I finish my hot chocolate first?

21:57.580 --> 21:58.611
Sure.

22:02.418 --> 22:03.747
I forgot.

22:04.837 --> 22:07.957
- What?
- How good you are with kids.

22:09.550 --> 22:11.709
You think he knows more
than he's letting on?

22:12.261 --> 22:13.661
I think he's worried about his dad.

22:13.805 --> 22:16.130
That's why he doesn't
wanna go to sleep.

22:19.477 --> 22:22.229
I guess he's not worried anymore.

22:29.571 --> 22:31.528
He'll be fine.

22:32.824 --> 22:35.196
It's been a long time.

22:35.410 --> 22:36.988
Us.

22:37.162 --> 22:39.285
Together outside of the office.

22:39.456 --> 22:40.998
Paris.

22:41.166 --> 22:44.701
If you don't count the hospitals
and car chases.

22:45.003 --> 22:46.462
I don't.

22:46.964 --> 22:49.799
You know, once upon a time,
I would have asked you to stay

22:50.717 --> 22:53.635
and I wouldn't have taken no
for an answer.

22:54.805 --> 22:56.679
No.

22:57.182 --> 22:59.508
What happened, Jethro?

23:00.060 --> 23:01.602
You made a choice.

23:02.187 --> 23:05.141
I had to do what was best for me.

23:05.733 --> 23:07.642
I still do.

23:18.287 --> 23:20.695
- This is gonna suck.
- Stop complaining.

23:20.873 --> 23:23.198
Sorry.
No sleep tends to do that to me.

23:23.376 --> 23:25.736
I drove, Tony. You could have slept
all night if you wanted.

23:25.878 --> 23:29.212
I tried, but the orchestra
of blaring car horns kept me awake.

23:29.382 --> 23:30.497
We made good time.

23:30.675 --> 23:33.711
Going 95 miles an hour on a dirt road.
I couldn't even see.

23:34.220 --> 23:36.676
Then it's a good thing I was driving.

23:38.683 --> 23:40.058
I am a trained navigator, Tony.

23:40.226 --> 23:42.136
Yeah, well, I got an A in Geography.

23:42.312 --> 23:44.221
Plus I'm senior field agent.
I'm pulling rank.

23:45.398 --> 23:46.727
I'm also a trained assassin.

23:48.944 --> 23:49.975
We'll shoot for it.

23:50.153 --> 23:51.232
Best two out of three.

23:58.495 --> 24:01.412
Snip, snip. I'll take that.

24:02.040 --> 24:03.582
Okay. All right.

24:05.877 --> 24:09.329
All right,
topographic speaks my language.

24:09.506 --> 24:11.748
Follow me. I got it.

24:13.927 --> 24:16.086
- Tony!
- What?

24:16.263 --> 24:19.430
The trail. It's this way.

24:23.646 --> 24:26.184
Did you ever share your personal
computer with someone?

24:26.357 --> 24:28.563
No, McGee, it's worse
than sharing your toothbrush.

24:28.734 --> 24:29.765
Why?

24:29.944 --> 24:32.695
I found a user account for It. Taylor
on Brian Taylor's hard drive.

24:32.863 --> 24:34.192
At least you found something.

24:34.615 --> 24:36.489
I have been looking
for the same hair sample

24:36.659 --> 24:38.901
for, like, 20 minutes.

24:39.745 --> 24:42.283
You know what my biggest
pet peeve is, McGee?

24:42.707 --> 24:44.616
People say they're vegetarians
but eat chicken.

24:44.792 --> 24:47.366
Okay, yes. Then what's my second
biggest pet peeve?

24:47.545 --> 24:48.576
Mishandled evidence.

24:48.755 --> 24:50.083
Yes again.

24:50.256 --> 24:51.631
I mean, there's absolutely...

24:51.799 --> 24:53.757
- No excuse for it.
- Exactly.

24:53.927 --> 24:59.052
And nine years ago,
Metro's so-called forensic scientist,

24:59.224 --> 25:01.893
Carolyn Watson,
she just goes through the motions,

25:02.060 --> 25:04.052
assuming that one day
somebody like me...

25:04.229 --> 25:05.474
Will clean up her mess.

25:05.647 --> 25:07.355
It's so...

25:07.983 --> 25:10.141
Why do I feel like
we've had this conversation before?

25:10.318 --> 25:13.319
Because we have. Just about every
time you get assigned a cold case.

25:14.865 --> 25:17.486
I am not the only one that complains
around here, McGee.

25:17.659 --> 25:18.690
You should see yourself

25:18.869 --> 25:20.992
when you're filtering
through a perp's computer.

25:21.163 --> 25:22.491
"Who formatted this thing?

25:22.664 --> 25:25.334
They used clusters instead
of physical sectors for allocations."

25:25.500 --> 25:27.493
And then your face
does this cool, weird,

25:27.669 --> 25:30.504
annoyed/confused deal...

25:30.672 --> 25:32.998
That's it. You're doing it right now.

25:33.175 --> 25:35.748
- She lied.
- Who lied?

25:35.928 --> 25:37.505
Elaine Taylor, she lied.

25:37.846 --> 25:39.341
Lied about what?

25:39.515 --> 25:41.673
Lied about what, McGee?

25:44.895 --> 25:48.181
Agent Gibbs, where is Carson?

25:48.357 --> 25:50.149
Is he okay?

25:50.317 --> 25:51.895
Yeah, he's fine.

25:52.069 --> 25:53.184
You're not.

25:56.949 --> 25:58.194
Look familiar, lieutenant?

25:59.243 --> 26:02.861
It's a background check you ran
on your husband two years ago.

26:03.456 --> 26:06.208
These are e-mails
you sent a private investigator

26:06.375 --> 26:08.997
asking him to look
into your husband's past.

26:09.629 --> 26:11.289
Said you trusted him.

26:12.840 --> 26:14.714
I was trying to protect him.

26:14.884 --> 26:16.082
From what?

26:16.261 --> 26:20.045
From whatever Brian did
that made him run nine years ago.

26:21.057 --> 26:23.050
How long have you known?

26:25.228 --> 26:27.137
Since before we were married.

26:28.231 --> 26:31.896
I always asked questions
about his parents,

26:32.068 --> 26:34.476
Carson's mother,
and he never gave a straight answer.

26:34.654 --> 26:35.983
Started researching.

26:36.156 --> 26:38.564
I found hundreds of Brian Taylors
from the D.C. area.

26:38.742 --> 26:40.062
But you never found your husband.

26:40.202 --> 26:41.530
No, I found him.

26:42.204 --> 26:44.031
In a picture of his high school
tennis team.

26:47.543 --> 26:48.574
That one?

26:48.752 --> 26:53.213
I saw that the caption said
that his surname was Matthews, but...

26:54.508 --> 26:57.177
I never had any doubt.
I knew it was him.

26:57.344 --> 26:59.088
And when you confronted him?

26:59.263 --> 27:00.294
She didn't.

27:01.807 --> 27:03.930
I was afraid of losing him.

27:05.686 --> 27:09.351
My husband ran for a reason
and I'm sure it was a damn good one.

27:09.523 --> 27:10.603
It was.

27:11.233 --> 27:12.265
Murder.

27:14.362 --> 27:15.737
Killed a store clerk.

27:16.489 --> 27:19.110
No.
No, Brian could never hurt anyone.

27:19.283 --> 27:21.525
- Brian Taylor or Brian Matthews?
- They're the same.

27:21.702 --> 27:23.280
People change, lieutenant.

27:24.872 --> 27:28.122
My husband is a good man
and an even better father.

27:28.292 --> 27:30.000
He coaches Little League.
He's in the PTA.

27:30.169 --> 27:32.079
And no matter where he is
or what he is doing,

27:32.255 --> 27:34.627
he always calls his son
to say good night.

27:35.675 --> 27:36.955
Always?

27:39.971 --> 27:43.554
It's gonna be all blues
in the ice bucket.

27:43.933 --> 27:47.100
- Ready?
- Ready, and go.

27:48.730 --> 27:49.893
Hey, where's your cell phone?

27:50.065 --> 27:52.141
- Excuse me.
- Give me your cell phone.

27:56.279 --> 27:58.319
- What are they doing?
- I'm not sure.

27:58.490 --> 28:00.779
Satellite phone number,
called last night, 11:30.

28:00.951 --> 28:02.326
Can you locate it?

28:02.494 --> 28:04.414
If the phone's still on.
Yeah, I can triangulate.

28:04.580 --> 28:06.987
- Do it, McGee.
- Wanna share, Agent Gibbs?

28:07.708 --> 28:10.163
Your phone bill just got bigger.

28:16.300 --> 28:17.711
What?

28:22.598 --> 28:23.973
Just give me
a couple more minutes.

28:24.141 --> 28:26.597
Come on, survivor man.
If I wasn't freezing to death...

28:26.769 --> 28:28.512
- Federal agents.
- Do not move.

28:28.687 --> 28:31.179
- Where is Taylor?
- I don't know.

28:31.357 --> 28:32.935
Is this part of the training?

28:35.319 --> 28:37.359
- DiNozzo.
- Hey, give me some good news.

28:37.530 --> 28:38.692
We're at the base camp.

28:39.490 --> 28:40.521
Taylor's not.

28:41.325 --> 28:42.488
He got tipped off.

28:42.660 --> 28:44.368
Yeah, by who?

28:45.530 --> 28:48.199
Does this mean I'm going to jail?

28:59.101 --> 29:01.010
When did you realise
Taylor was gone?

29:01.186 --> 29:03.144
This morning around 5 a.m.

29:03.314 --> 29:05.556
We've been out here alone
ever since.

29:05.733 --> 29:07.275
Yeah, heartbreaking.

29:09.111 --> 29:11.104
Will you stop that?

29:16.369 --> 29:18.611
- Did you see which way he went?
- I heard a noise.

29:18.788 --> 29:21.540
In the middle of the night.
Behind us.

29:21.707 --> 29:22.739
A noise?

29:22.917 --> 29:24.459
Yeah, like running.

29:24.877 --> 29:28.211
I took a look to check it out,
it was just a deer.

29:29.716 --> 29:32.337
- A deer?
- Yeah, a big one.

29:32.510 --> 29:34.717
Big, big deer.

29:34.888 --> 29:36.548
Whatever you think is best, director.

29:38.516 --> 29:40.972
The city slickers saw something.

29:41.144 --> 29:43.018
A deer. It was a big one.

29:43.188 --> 29:44.988
Director Shepard wants us
to hold our position

29:45.148 --> 29:47.520
while McGee attempts
to locate Taylor's signal.

29:47.692 --> 29:48.724
If he doesn't?

29:48.902 --> 29:50.562
A search team is on its way
to assist us.

29:50.737 --> 29:53.026
What about our courageous
frontiersmen?

29:53.198 --> 29:55.950
They will be escorted out
when the search team arrives.

29:56.118 --> 29:57.398
Lucky them.

29:57.577 --> 30:01.243
I've gotta tell you, Agent Gibbs,
you're full of surprises.

30:02.082 --> 30:05.581
- Is that right?
- Ice cream as a punishment?

30:06.545 --> 30:07.920
There's no way I saw that coming.

30:09.298 --> 30:11.919
What makes you think
you're being punished?

30:13.135 --> 30:14.415
I messed up.

30:14.595 --> 30:16.552
You did?

30:16.722 --> 30:17.967
I called my dad.

30:18.140 --> 30:20.809
I told him you guys
were looking for him.

30:21.352 --> 30:22.929
You just told the truth.

30:23.354 --> 30:24.516
Yeah, but...

30:24.688 --> 30:26.017
I know...

30:26.190 --> 30:27.933
No buts.

30:28.109 --> 30:30.397
You were trying to protect your dad.

30:32.238 --> 30:35.773
He said he's gonna be gone
for a while.

30:37.368 --> 30:39.195
I told him all about you.

30:39.370 --> 30:42.205
He said he'd like to meet you
one day.

30:45.460 --> 30:48.081
I told him you were on our side.

30:50.798 --> 30:55.176
Everyone's been really great
to me here, Agent Gibbs.

30:55.345 --> 31:01.300
Between you and me,
I am ready for this to be over.

31:04.312 --> 31:07.099
Study those photographs,
Mr. Palmer.

31:07.274 --> 31:09.266
Tell me what you see.

31:09.442 --> 31:12.313
Brian Taylor and his son fishing.

31:12.487 --> 31:13.768
Yeah. And that one?

31:14.322 --> 31:15.982
Father and son hiking.

31:16.158 --> 31:18.731
- What about those?
- Father and son...

31:18.910 --> 31:21.662
They're all the same, doctor.
Carson and his dad hanging out.

31:21.830 --> 31:22.861
Precisely.

31:23.040 --> 31:24.831
Abby printed
over a hundred photographs

31:25.000 --> 31:29.911
from Brian Taylor's computer, and all
of them are similar in nature to these.

31:30.089 --> 31:31.713
I see.

31:32.341 --> 31:35.626
Actually, I don't think
I see as clearly as I think you see.

31:35.803 --> 31:38.839
Mr. Palmer, when conducting
a psychological analysis,

31:39.014 --> 31:41.588
the first thing you have to do
is establish patterns.

31:41.767 --> 31:44.519
Because patterns are the most
efficient gateway into the mind.

31:44.687 --> 31:46.478
You read your study material.

31:46.647 --> 31:47.678
I'm impressed.

31:47.857 --> 31:50.145
But it seems like
the only patterns we see here

31:50.318 --> 31:52.809
are that Brian Taylor enjoyed
spending time with his son.

31:52.987 --> 31:58.064
And in pursuit,
devoid of typical human contact.

31:58.242 --> 32:00.152
- And that's bad because...
- No, no, no.

32:00.328 --> 32:03.282
Your job is not to judge,
but to understand.

32:03.456 --> 32:07.917
The father's pursuit of solitude
is indicative of a far deeper problem.

32:08.086 --> 32:10.043
- Which would be?
- Trust.

32:10.213 --> 32:11.244
Lack of it.

32:11.422 --> 32:13.581
Well, the evidence is all here,
Jethro.

32:13.758 --> 32:15.667
Separate bank accounts
from his wife.

32:15.844 --> 32:19.129
A date book that shows
very little social interaction.

32:19.305 --> 32:20.634
And, of course...

32:21.808 --> 32:24.050
- His job.
- Survivalist training.

32:24.227 --> 32:29.566
Yes, it's a field which typically lures
a very specific type of personality.

32:29.733 --> 32:33.517
- Loners.
- And that leads us to his diary.

32:33.695 --> 32:36.103
Yeah, it shows that he has
very few social engagements

32:36.281 --> 32:37.692
other than with his son.

32:37.866 --> 32:40.820
He has led a troubled life
that is full of pain.

32:40.994 --> 32:43.912
And, Mr. Palmer, someone
who's experienced this much pain

32:44.081 --> 32:47.035
often finds release
in the form of rage.

32:47.751 --> 32:50.325
Yeah, or murder.

32:50.504 --> 32:54.716
And to think
I never gave him study material.

32:58.512 --> 33:00.172
Oh, God. These are new boots.

33:00.347 --> 33:02.554
This is not the time
for sightseeing, Tony.

33:02.725 --> 33:04.385
The only sight I see
is your big black...

33:04.560 --> 33:07.514
- Hey.
- Backpack walking faster.

33:08.481 --> 33:11.565
- Are you winded or something?
- No, I did stop for a water break.

33:11.734 --> 33:14.355
You know,
humans do that sometimes.

33:17.615 --> 33:20.367
- DiNozzo.
- Taylor's phone was just activated.

33:20.535 --> 33:23.108
- We're tracking it now.
- Yeah, welcome to the club.

33:23.287 --> 33:26.538
- I wish I could say it's a fun one.
- You sound tired, DiNozzo.

33:26.708 --> 33:28.784
Following Ziva.
Even the dogs are tired.

33:30.503 --> 33:33.125
Taylor's heading right towards you.
Keep your course.

33:33.298 --> 33:34.958
- How far?
- A hundred yards.

33:35.133 --> 33:36.627
Give or take.

33:36.801 --> 33:39.553
It looks like he's passing through
some sort of clearing. Maybe a...

33:39.721 --> 33:42.046
- Dirt road?
- Yeah. How'd you...?

33:42.223 --> 33:43.967
Well, we're staring at it, McGee.

33:44.809 --> 33:46.968
Talk to me, DiNozzo.

33:47.145 --> 33:48.308
Got a visual.

33:55.404 --> 33:57.480
Stop! Federal agents.

34:02.744 --> 34:03.942
Problem, sweetheart?

34:04.121 --> 34:05.401
Do not move.

34:06.290 --> 34:08.117
Cab is clear.

34:15.674 --> 34:18.165
Looks like
this is gonna be a long night.

34:19.594 --> 34:21.422
A casino.

34:21.889 --> 34:23.431
A hotel.

34:24.058 --> 34:25.681
Spring break.

34:26.351 --> 34:28.060
A mansion.

34:29.480 --> 34:31.437
No, I got it. I got it.

34:31.607 --> 34:33.185
The Playboy Mansion.

34:33.359 --> 34:34.984
Playboy?

34:35.152 --> 34:36.527
It's a school, Carson.

34:37.029 --> 34:38.688
You sure you don't know
Anthony DiNozzo?

34:43.703 --> 34:45.161
Guys.

34:51.252 --> 34:52.331
Are you okay?

34:52.504 --> 34:54.460
Yeah. I'm with child.

34:55.507 --> 34:57.998
The director asked me
to watch Carson this morning,

34:58.176 --> 34:59.296
so I enlisted Palmer's help.

34:59.427 --> 35:01.918
It turns out
he's a pretty good babysitter.

35:02.097 --> 35:04.469
Why exactly are you standing
by the elevator?

35:04.641 --> 35:07.132
For privacy,
I don't want you-know-who to hear.

35:07.310 --> 35:09.386
Come on.

35:10.397 --> 35:13.314
So I hacked
the Global Star database

35:13.483 --> 35:15.974
and I accessed the call log
from Brian Taylor's SAT phone.

35:16.153 --> 35:19.154
- How?
- Oh, it was not easy.

35:19.323 --> 35:22.608
First, I exploited a weakness I found
in the network's packet filter...

35:22.784 --> 35:24.777
- Abby.
- Sorry. Right.

35:24.953 --> 35:29.532
Anyway,
so Taylor made one phone call.

35:29.708 --> 35:30.823
Ronald Keenan.

35:31.627 --> 35:33.370
That's good work.

35:35.214 --> 35:37.005
Palmer, no gestures.

36:01.532 --> 36:05.067
I repeat, this is 911.
Please state your emergency.

36:05.244 --> 36:08.744
Officers have been dispatched
to your location.

36:24.372 --> 36:27.622
This young man never stood
a fighting chance, Jethro,

36:27.792 --> 36:29.701
because unfortunately for him...

36:29.878 --> 36:31.787
He didn't fight.

36:32.255 --> 36:33.998
- Sorry, doctor.
- No, you're right.

36:34.174 --> 36:38.123
Note the lack of defensive wounds
on his forearms and hands.

36:38.303 --> 36:39.334
He knew his attacker.

36:39.512 --> 36:43.676
Yes, judging by that hunting knife
in his chest,

36:43.850 --> 36:47.302
I think we can presume that their
relationship had soured somewhat.

36:47.479 --> 36:50.646
Boss, I spoke with 911 Dispatch.
Keenan didn't say a word.

36:50.816 --> 36:53.485
Yes, well, given the circumstances,

36:53.652 --> 36:56.190
even dialling the phone
was quite a feat.

36:56.363 --> 36:59.150
It's amazing what a person can do
when their life depends on it.

37:01.910 --> 37:04.745
- Yeah, Gibbs.
- I found a Taurus on Maple.

37:04.913 --> 37:06.989
Stolen from Black Ridge parking lot
this morning.

37:07.166 --> 37:09.538
Maple Street. Any sign of Taylor?

37:09.710 --> 37:11.999
Zip. Been combing the area
for over an hour.

37:12.379 --> 37:14.253
My gut says he found another ride.

37:14.423 --> 37:18.919
That's not all. Blood on the door handle
and the steering wheel.

37:19.094 --> 37:21.764
- Maple Street, three blocks away.
- Yeah.

37:23.265 --> 37:25.591
Ronald Keenan,
born and raised in the D.C. area.

37:25.768 --> 37:28.093
Happened to be one of Brian Taylor's
high school buddies.

37:28.270 --> 37:31.770
Metro interviewed him nine years ago.
Said he didn't know why Taylor ran.

37:31.941 --> 37:33.056
Maybe he didn't.

37:33.401 --> 37:35.808
- There's a reason he's dead.
- Yeah, murder.

37:35.987 --> 37:37.564
He's 5'10", 180 pounds.

37:37.738 --> 37:39.530
He matches
our witness' description.

37:39.699 --> 37:41.822
I think we just found
Taylor's accomplice.

37:41.993 --> 37:43.238
NCIS, Agent McGee.

37:43.411 --> 37:45.036
Taylor knows
we have the murder weapon.

37:45.204 --> 37:47.909
The last thing he needed was
his accomplice nervous and flipping.

37:48.082 --> 37:50.490
Agent Gibbs.
Sure, I'll get him for you now.

37:50.668 --> 37:52.791
Boss, Brian Taylor asking for you
by name.

37:55.507 --> 37:57.464
Starting the trace.

37:59.803 --> 38:01.261
Ready.

38:01.805 --> 38:03.264
Special Agent Gibbs.

38:03.431 --> 38:05.757
How's my son, Agent Gibbs?

38:05.934 --> 38:07.974
Scared. Confused.

38:08.770 --> 38:10.514
That makes two of us.

38:10.689 --> 38:12.100
You want sympathy?

38:12.274 --> 38:13.472
I want my life back.

38:13.650 --> 38:16.900
Which life?
Brian Matthews or Brian Taylor?

38:17.070 --> 38:18.814
I ran because
I didn't wanna lose my son.

38:19.573 --> 38:21.447
I was naive.

38:21.617 --> 38:23.858
I was a 20-year-old
who made a lot of mistakes.

38:24.036 --> 38:26.408
- Murder?
- I never killed anyone.

38:26.580 --> 38:28.620
Tell that to Keenan.

38:28.791 --> 38:30.166
Keenan was my friend.

38:31.669 --> 38:33.412
I'd hate to see your enemies.

38:34.004 --> 38:36.127
Carson says you're good.

38:36.298 --> 38:37.674
He says you're on our side.

38:39.760 --> 38:41.420
Yeah? Well, he's a smart kid.

38:42.221 --> 38:43.715
Are you?

38:43.889 --> 38:45.348
Are you on our side, Agent Gibbs?

38:46.517 --> 38:48.925
Come in. Tell me what happened.

38:49.770 --> 38:51.181
If I do that, my life's over.

38:51.355 --> 38:53.977
- Not if you're innocent.
- It's not that simple.

38:55.234 --> 38:57.393
You've got this all wrong.

39:00.198 --> 39:02.486
Payphone north end
of Rock Creek Park.

39:03.993 --> 39:05.322
Call DiNozzo.

39:14.379 --> 39:15.956
Pair up. Spread out.

39:16.131 --> 39:18.040
We'll take east of the creek.
The rest is yours.

39:18.216 --> 39:19.876
- On it.
- The north or the south?

39:20.051 --> 39:22.459
South. Let's go.

39:24.890 --> 39:26.716
- Yeah, Gibbs.
- Big news, Gibbs.

39:26.892 --> 39:29.098
The bloody fingerprints we found
on Keenan's phone,

39:29.269 --> 39:30.432
they didn't belong to Keenan.

39:30.604 --> 39:33.309
- They were Brian Taylor's.
- That means Taylor called 911.

39:33.482 --> 39:34.513
And that's not all.

39:34.691 --> 39:37.609
I've been looking at the evidence
from the Stop 'N' Go,

39:37.778 --> 39:39.272
really sloppy police work.

39:39.446 --> 39:40.525
What do you got, Abby?

39:40.697 --> 39:43.651
A strand of hair
that has titanium dioxide.

39:43.826 --> 39:44.857
English, Abby.

39:45.035 --> 39:46.529
It's a synthetic gel.

39:46.703 --> 39:49.408
But it didn't hit stores until 2002,
which is strange.

39:49.581 --> 39:51.823
- Because...
- Murder happened in '98.

39:52.001 --> 39:53.401
Someone was tampering
with evidence.

39:53.544 --> 39:54.824
According to chain of evidence,

39:55.004 --> 39:57.246
there were only two officers
that had access.

40:01.510 --> 40:02.839
- You go that way.
- Got it.

40:10.770 --> 40:12.264
McGee.

40:12.438 --> 40:14.763
- He wants us here.
- Why?

40:14.941 --> 40:16.186
Payphone number.

40:25.410 --> 40:26.524
Hey, you were framed.

40:26.703 --> 40:29.372
I guess Carson was right.
You are on our side.

40:29.539 --> 40:31.247
Stay where you are. I'll come to you.

40:31.416 --> 40:33.455
Not a chance. I'm coming to you.

40:33.626 --> 40:35.619
And only you.

40:39.049 --> 40:40.128
What you doing, boss?

40:40.675 --> 40:42.383
My job.

40:48.433 --> 40:50.640
Don't move, Taylor.

40:53.146 --> 40:54.973
You armed?

41:00.320 --> 41:01.483
Hold on to it.

41:02.990 --> 41:04.401
Less for me to explain.

41:04.908 --> 41:07.115
- You killed Keenan.
- I should have done it years ago.

41:07.661 --> 41:09.239
He was gonna tell.

41:10.289 --> 41:12.246
From killer to cop.

41:12.583 --> 41:13.783
It's funny how life works out.

41:14.168 --> 41:15.413
Why'd you set me up?

41:15.586 --> 41:17.329
I didn't. Spur of the moment.

41:18.297 --> 41:19.577
Just needed a gun, that's all.

41:19.757 --> 41:21.500
Keenan said he knew a guy
who had one.

41:21.675 --> 41:23.668
Now I've got my own.

41:23.886 --> 41:25.001
Government issued.

41:25.179 --> 41:26.507
So is mine.

41:28.432 --> 41:30.057
Put it down.

41:34.564 --> 41:37.849
He's got a knife, Agent Gibbs.
I was just protecting myself.

41:38.025 --> 41:39.603
Hey.

41:40.403 --> 41:41.434
So was I.

41:47.202 --> 41:49.693
I should have done it years ago.
He was gonna tell.

41:52.248 --> 41:54.158
You set me up?

41:54.876 --> 41:56.251
Yeah.

41:56.878 --> 41:57.993
Kind of ironic, huh?

41:58.171 --> 42:00.543
Looks like we're one for three,
Collins.

42:03.718 --> 42:09.839
Okay, one more answer correct
and I win my title back.

42:10.016 --> 42:12.804
- From a 10-year-old.
- Who has just been through hell.

42:12.978 --> 42:16.347
You mess with the bull,
you get the horns.

42:16.940 --> 42:18.399
No exceptions.

42:19.193 --> 42:20.603
All right.

42:23.113 --> 42:28.902
In the 1985 film, Back to the Future,
this device makes time travel possible.

42:29.078 --> 42:30.240
Come on, baby. I'm back.

42:30.412 --> 42:33.579
What is the flux capacitor?

42:39.088 --> 42:41.923
- Wait. What happened?
- You spelled capacitor wrong.

42:47.096 --> 42:48.590
Tough break.

42:48.764 --> 42:50.424
I bow to the champion.

42:50.600 --> 42:51.714
Handshake will do.

42:51.893 --> 42:53.268
Okay.

43:07.575 --> 43:08.773
- There he is.
- Oh, my God.

43:08.952 --> 43:10.494
- Carson.
- Mom. Dad.

43:10.662 --> 43:12.904
I'm so glad you're okay.

43:13.081 --> 43:14.244
I'm really gonna miss him.

43:14.708 --> 43:16.617
- Mom.
- Yeah.

43:16.793 --> 43:18.418
There's something about that kid.

43:19.462 --> 43:20.542
I missed you so much.

43:20.714 --> 43:21.745
I missed you too.
