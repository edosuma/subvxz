Previously on American Dad.

00:09.976 --> 00:13.742
- I forbid you to do that play!
- You forbid me? Ha!

00:13.847 --> 00:17.874
I'm not going to fire you, Smith.
I'm going to promote you.

00:17.984 --> 00:21.283
It will requireyou
and your family to relocate.

00:21.388 --> 00:23.788
[Stan ]
Wait a minute!

00:23.890 --> 00:27.087
- This isn't a promotion.
- Saudi Arabia is a dry country.

00:27.193 --> 00:29.093
You think
that's something?

00:29.195 --> 00:31.527
Wait till you hear
the rules about women.

00:31.631 --> 00:34.225
Surprise!
I got us a second wife.

00:34.334 --> 00:37.098
- How much for the woman?
- Woman?

00:37.203 --> 00:40.036
Oh, no, that's
just Rog- Sold.

00:41.808 --> 00:44.936
I am a man!

00:45.045 --> 00:46.945
I've decided to giveyou
your old job back.

00:47.047 --> 00:50.210
- Sir, I kind oflike it here.
- What aboutyour family?

00:52.352 --> 00:56.186
I officially renounce
our American citizenship.

00:56.289 --> 00:59.725
The Smiths are staying
in Saudi Arabia forever!

01:02.762 --> 01:05.993
Francine, Thundercat,
there's no need to fight over me.

01:06.099 --> 01:07.999
- I loveyou both equally.
- What?

01:08.101 --> 01:11.730
Francine, we live in Saudi Arabia now,
and in Saudi Arabia...

01:11.838 --> 01:15.137
Daddy makes the decisions,
Mommy makes a sandwich.

01:15.241 --> 01:18.039
Mommy makes a sandwich.

01:18.144 --> 01:20.078
You've lost it, Stan.

01:20.180 --> 01:22.239
Has your boss called
to offeryou yourjob backyet?

01:22.348 --> 01:24.248
Nope, he didn't
call me an hour ago.

01:24.350 --> 01:26.750
Or maybe it wasn't more
like an hour and a halfago.

01:28.655 --> 01:31.715
Mmm! Delicious sandwich,
Number One.

01:31.825 --> 01:33.725
I'm sorry.
She's in the lead now.

01:33.827 --> 01:37.263
She got 50 points for making the sandwich.
Oh, yeah, there's points.

01:38.364 --> 01:40.924
- Get back here, whore!
- It's okay.

01:41.034 --> 01:43.696
I respectyour right
to chase me.

01:43.803 --> 01:46.033
Aah! Son of a bitch!

01:46.139 --> 01:49.108
My face!
Damn it! Aah!

01:50.310 --> 01:53.302
- [ Gulps ]
- Oh, thereyou are.

01:53.413 --> 01:56.905
Hey,you know a woman can't be out
in public unescorted bya man.

01:57.016 --> 01:59.644
- You know this harlot?
- She is my sister.

01:59.752 --> 02:02.220
- Right, Sis?
- Uh, yeah.

02:02.322 --> 02:04.552
[Man ]All units to the northeast

02:04.657 --> 02:07.524
- 220 in progress!
- 220? Someone just spotted a woman's ankles.

02:07.627 --> 02:09.526
Let's move.

02:09.628 --> 02:12.530
You should be more careful
around the police ofvice and virtue.

02:12.632 --> 02:14.532
Doyou want
to get stoned?

02:14.634 --> 02:16.864
Yes! Oh, my God!
It's been, like, forever.

02:16.970 --> 02:19.131
You would like
to be buried up toyour neck...

02:19.239 --> 02:22.037
and have a crowd of angry men
throw rocks at your head?

02:22.142 --> 02:26.135
- Oh. No.
- Normally, I wouldn't come
to the aid of an American.

02:26.246 --> 02:28.544
Your country's
foreign policy is despicable...

02:28.648 --> 02:32.015
your culture is crude, and your gluttony
and greed make me sick.

02:33.586 --> 02:36.077
You are so hot.

02:39.526 --> 02:42.962
Whoa. That thing
came out of nowhere.

02:43.062 --> 02:45.155
[StarterFiring]

02:45.265 --> 02:48.098
[ Sighs ] I'm stranded in
the middle of a desert...

02:48.201 --> 02:50.499
with no food, no water,
but at least...

02:50.603 --> 02:53.697
I finally get to see
Angelina Jolie's sweet...

02:53.806 --> 02:55.774

02:56.976 --> 03:02.608
No!

03:02.715 --> 03:05.707
I'm gonna kill Steve.
Selling me to some stranger.

03:05.818 --> 03:07.911
And he didn't even haggle.
By the way...

03:08.021 --> 03:10.353
these baskets go for, like,
80 bucks at Pier One.

03:10.456 --> 03:13.084
I betyou paid, what,
like 50 cents? Be honest.

03:13.193 --> 03:16.060
Silence! You were not purchased
foryour opinions.

03:16.162 --> 03:19.063
- You were purchased to be a wife.
- Wife?

03:19.165 --> 03:21.463
Look, bub, I'm not
marrying you!

03:21.568 --> 03:25.265

Well, a girl can't
hold out forever.

03:39.419 --> 03:41.649
The Iraq war
was a travesty.

03:41.754 --> 03:45.281
Exactly. It's like the whole
unilateral preemption thing is-

03:45.391 --> 03:48.155
[ Together] An insupportable doctrine
with inevitable negative...

03:48.261 --> 03:50.491
repercussions on
the geopolitical stage!

03:52.599 --> 03:56.091
- Hey, you want to get dinner?
- Ooh, now is not good.

03:56.202 --> 03:59.831
I have a meeting. I'm in this
secret group called Al-Qae-

03:59.939 --> 04:02.407
"Al-qae-holics" Anonymous?

04:02.508 --> 04:06.342
Hayley, promise meyou won't go near
the American embassy.

04:06.446 --> 04:08.346
The embassy?
Oh, my God, you're a-

04:08.448 --> 04:11.440
Oh, Kazim, no! Look,
I hate America's policies too...

04:11.551 --> 04:13.781
- but there are otherways.
- Oh, Hayley...

04:13.886 --> 04:17.014
perhaps if I had met such an incredible
Western girl years ago.

04:17.123 --> 04:19.613
- But it's not too late! You can't-
- No. I must.

04:19.726 --> 04:21.990
- It is written.
- Nothing is written.

04:30.970 --> 04:34.098
It's so good to have Stan
working with us on the pipeline...

04:34.207 --> 04:36.607
and not for the-
yuck- United States.

04:36.709 --> 04:39.872
- Imperialist swine.
- Theywant to enslave all Arabs.

04:39.979 --> 04:43.972
You know damn well that America
does not want to enslave all Arabs.

04:44.083 --> 04:46.051
Just the ones
who have oil.

04:48.154 --> 04:50.918
Am I right, fellas?
Yeah. Americans. Ha!

04:51.024 --> 04:53.492
Bunch of douche bags.
Praise Allah.

04:58.164 --> 05:01.930
Deputy Director Bullock,
will you please offer Stan his job back?

05:02.035 --> 05:03.935
Francine,
what a surprise.

05:04.037 --> 05:08.064
I already offered
Stan his job back. He said no.

05:08.174 --> 05:10.699
[ Screams ]

05:10.810 --> 05:12.869
Your family may have
moved to Saudi Arabia...

05:12.979 --> 05:15.174
but I'm the real
fish out ofwater.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.883
Seriously, I'm dying.

05:21.821 --> 05:25.086
Okay. I'm cool.

05:25.191 --> 05:27.819
Whatever life throws at me,
I can take it...

05:27.927 --> 05:31.385
because I am a strong,
independent blackwoman.

05:31.497 --> 05:35.194
I mean, white teenager.
Oh, God! I'm gonna die out here!

05:37.904 --> 05:42.671

we onlyjust met!

06:29.555 --> 06:33.958
Oh, Hayley,
that was so wonderful.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.528
But now
I'm so confused.

06:36.629 --> 06:39.655
It's like I'm not
sure who I am anymore.

06:39.766 --> 06:42.200
Why, because ofthat thing
I did with my finger?

06:42.301 --> 06:44.531

and you liked it.

07:00.353 --> 07:02.821
- You lied to me, Stan!
- You're right.

07:02.922 --> 07:04.913
And it was a mistake to lie.
You know why?

07:05.024 --> 07:08.460
Because I didn't have to.
Because I'm the man, and what I say goes.

07:08.561 --> 07:11.792
And I say Saudi Arabia's
the greatest country in the world.

What is this
you speak of?

10:44.243 --> 10:46.768
You know,
