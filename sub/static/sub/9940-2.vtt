16:55.880 --> 16:59.668
- That's a Manchester accent, non?
- Who said that?

16:59.760 --> 17:03.912
(Man with French accent)
Cheadle Hulme, five years, mid-'80s.

17:04.000 --> 17:09.154
Oh, man, thank you! Tell...
Just tell him, will you? Just tell him!

17:29.160 --> 17:31.515
What is it you need to say first?

17:32.360 --> 17:34.510
Me name's Frank Gallagher.

17:34.600 --> 17:38.354
l live at 2 Windsor Gardens, Stretford.

17:50.760 --> 17:56.710
Look, I'm scared cos I haven't a clue
what happened last night.

17:56.800 --> 17:59.155
I'm pricking meself here, yer know.

18:13.000 --> 18:18.154
(Frank) What did he say, mate? What?
Qu'est-ce que sayo, mate?

18:18.240 --> 18:22.199
(Frank) Hey! Come on! C'est une mistake!

18:22.280 --> 18:24.714
- No! Frank?
- ln France?

18:24.800 --> 18:28.429
l know! Well, Calais, so only just.

18:28.520 --> 18:30.670
(All) How?

18:30.760 --> 18:36.357
The embassy says he admitted to drugs
charges even before they accused him.

18:36.440 --> 18:39.796
- They're charging him?
- No. He'll be escorted through t'tunnel.

18:39.880 --> 18:44.271
- When will you get him back here?
- We can't unless you shell out for a car.

18:44.360 --> 18:49.309
You could get him. We could nip across,
pick up some booze like our Kirsty does.

18:49.400 --> 18:52.915
Could I fuck! Because...
Tone, no offence.

18:57.520 --> 18:59.795
(# Humming the Marseillaise)

18:59.880 --> 19:05.079
Car's not insured, tax disk's a photocopy
and the shocks won't get us past Asda.

19:06.160 --> 19:08.435
- Right, Tone.
- (Tony continues humming)

19:27.840 --> 19:30.991
l just grabbed a shower.
l was coming back round.

19:36.360 --> 19:38.316
Becks, can you... Cheers.

19:46.760 --> 19:49.957
- Who's she?
- She's a tenant.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.117
- What's up?
- How did you get my dad to France?

19:55.880 --> 19:59.236
You... lt's me? Are you serious? Me?

20:00.120 --> 20:05.035
- French health warnings.
- Boot of the car.

20:05.120 --> 20:07.998
- How did you get him in the boot?
- He was off his face.

20:08.080 --> 20:11.834
- He went out with just a tenner!
- I gave him a 20 and a few tabs.

20:11.920 --> 20:14.514
- Why France?
- My sister lives in Folkestone.

20:14.600 --> 20:18.752
l was going down to see the new kid.
ldea was to drop him somewhere weird.

20:18.840 --> 20:22.037
Then I saw these signs
for the Channel Tunnel.

20:22.120 --> 20:26.989
- The idea just kind of...snowballed.
- And that's funny, Steve?

20:27.080 --> 20:30.914
- Really funny would've been Bosnia.
- Cos he took a swing at you?

20:31.000 --> 20:34.595
He needs a wake-up call
before he wrecks your family's lives!

20:34.680 --> 20:37.478
Bollocks!
You hadn't the guts to whack him back!

20:37.560 --> 20:40.199
l don't do violence. Ahh!

20:40.280 --> 20:45.035
What my dad is and what my family is
has fuck all to do with someone like you!

20:47.160 --> 20:48.912
Bastard!

20:53.040 --> 20:56.271
- (Microwave pings)
- Sorry, can I just...

20:57.840 --> 21:01.833
lt's just that l've got to be out
in quarter of an hour or so.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.875
You took him there, you get him back!

21:23.680 --> 21:26.831
- Get a PlayStation 2.
- I'll see what I can do.

21:26.920 --> 21:31.232
lf they have any CDs for under a fiver,
get us five, but only UK chart.

21:32.120 --> 21:35.874
Take his birth certificate
in case they need it for identification.

21:38.360 --> 21:41.909
Hey, Steve, tow bar's on,
trailer lights work like magic.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.833
- Get seven cases of lager for my dad.
- No way.

21:44.920 --> 21:48.230
The only booze I'm bringing back is ours.
Whose is this?

21:48.320 --> 21:51.232
Listen! Oi, oi, shut up, listen!

21:51.320 --> 21:55.871
Police have just found a body
exactly fitting Frank's description.

21:55.960 --> 21:59.919
(Screams)

22:00.000 --> 22:03.959
- I knew it! I knew it! I dreamt it was Dad!
- Listen...

22:04.040 --> 22:07.032
- Has nobody told her?
- We hadn't seen her for hours.

22:07.120 --> 22:11.079
- They found him. Dad's coming home.
- I feel rotten now.

22:11.160 --> 22:15.551
- lt were a joke, sweetheart.
- He's in France. He's OK.

22:15.640 --> 22:19.155
Steve and Kev and Veronica
are off to get him.

22:19.240 --> 22:23.472
- What's he doing in France?
- We'll have him home for morning.

22:23.560 --> 22:27.633
I'm really sorry we scared you, Debs.
l'm really, really sorry.

22:27.720 --> 22:31.235
Joke was, it wasn't a bloke,
it were three bags of rags!

22:31.320 --> 22:34.198
They knew it couldn't be Frank
cos the socks matched!

22:36.600 --> 22:39.034
(All talking at once)

22:52.680 --> 22:57.037
No way am I pulling
that fucking monstrosity! Here you are.

23:09.360 --> 23:13.114
- Is this Steve bloke a fixture now?
- Just somebody I met.

23:13.200 --> 23:17.557
Right. I'm wondering
where that leaves me, then, Fiona.

23:18.600 --> 23:21.717
- You? What?
- Me with you.

23:27.080 --> 23:30.356
Tony, we had a great night out.

23:30.440 --> 23:32.476
Great mates, great laugh.

23:32.560 --> 23:35.996
Good sex. That's it.

23:36.960 --> 23:42.512
Oh, come on. That's the whole point,
innit? One-night stand. No strings.

23:42.600 --> 23:44.750
You were my first.

23:47.120 --> 23:50.954
- First one-night stand or first...?
- The first.

23:51.040 --> 23:55.716
I only got circumcised when I were 18
so it set me back. Way back.

23:55.800 --> 23:58.394
So if you want to take the piss,
spread that around.

23:58.480 --> 24:00.198
Hey...

24:01.120 --> 24:03.953
if that was your first,
you weren't half bad.

24:06.240 --> 24:07.355
Thanks.

24:15.720 --> 24:19.395
(Kev) Hey up!
No place like home, eh, Frank?

24:20.680 --> 24:24.195
- Good to be back.
- For fuck's sake!

25:32.560 --> 25:35.358
(Crowd talking and laughing outside)

25:47.920 --> 25:51.469
- (Knocking at door)
- Are you decent?

25:52.760 --> 25:57.390
l got you this. lt's from France.
l asked Veronica to get it for us.

25:57.480 --> 26:00.313
Don't want nothing French in this house!

26:04.520 --> 26:06.988
- There's no hot water.
- What?

26:07.920 --> 26:10.480
(Splashes) Oh, for fuck's sake!

26:10.560 --> 26:15.395
Er, your Giro. And it's Saturday
so t'post office closes at 12.

26:15.480 --> 26:17.835
- ls he still here?
- Steve?

26:17.920 --> 26:22.072
- No, he's nipped home to get changed.
- Tell him not to bother coming back.

26:22.160 --> 26:26.756
- He spent 500 quid bailing you out.
- And why would he do that, eh?

26:26.840 --> 26:32.119
When I woke up in France, in a park,
looking like a fucking dosser,

26:32.200 --> 26:34.714
all I could smell was air freshener.

26:34.800 --> 26:37.792
Middle of the park - orange air freshener!

26:37.880 --> 26:43.477
l've just spent five hours in his car.
Same fucking smell!

26:45.240 --> 26:47.390
He did this!

26:59.160 --> 27:02.914
l wish you'd taken a camera,
with you in the pictures.

27:03.000 --> 27:06.709
Total shithole.
Hey, definition of French foreplay!

27:11.880 --> 27:14.519
- Bet you're the only one that missed me.
- No.

27:14.600 --> 27:17.751
Cos Carl said, ''The gas has gone.
Where's the pliers?''

27:17.840 --> 27:21.799
And Lip said, ''Dad's the only one
who knows how to do the meter.''

27:24.200 --> 27:26.509
- Did you see Paris?
- Yeah.

27:26.600 --> 27:29.114
The Eiffel Tower?

27:29.200 --> 27:35.469
Christ, yeah! But, you know, you can see
right across France from the top.

27:36.600 --> 27:40.036
Yeah, but I didn't stay up too long.

27:40.120 --> 27:42.509
Don't know what French birds are into,

27:42.600 --> 27:47.355
but they're looking at me like,
"Hey, I am 'aving zis guy."

27:47.440 --> 27:51.433
It got a bit unnerving
so I legged it back down.

27:52.600 --> 27:56.752
Bits of France are gorgeous,
but you just gotta know your way about.

27:56.840 --> 27:59.991
- Do you now?
- Every inch.

28:01.560 --> 28:05.314
Hey, I have to cash my Giro.
Do us a brew for when I get back.

28:09.160 --> 28:11.390
Look, he can't know.

28:11.480 --> 28:16.429
He does. And even if he doesn't,
he thinks you did it so it makes no odds.

28:16.520 --> 28:18.476
But I gave him three Zopiclone.

28:18.560 --> 28:23.236
Mum...said don't use more than two or
you won't know your name for a week!

28:23.320 --> 28:25.993
- Your mum was in on this?
- Well, yeah...

28:26.080 --> 28:29.231
No. She prescribed the Zopiclone
for me.

28:30.280 --> 28:32.350
- She's a doctor?
- Yeah.

28:32.920 --> 28:37.948
Mum, Dad, brother, sister. We're
the medical equivalent of a battery farm.

28:38.040 --> 28:42.591
Me included, if I hadn't run a mile.
I quit medical school two years in.

28:42.680 --> 28:46.229
l am that DlY plane from Chicken Run.

28:46.320 --> 28:49.596
- You walked away from that?
- Sprinted away!

28:49.680 --> 28:54.037
ln the vain hope of finding a personality
that wasn't a carbon copy of my father's.

28:54.120 --> 28:57.032
So you nick cars for a living.

28:57.120 --> 28:59.076
I do what I chose to do.

29:00.160 --> 29:02.549
And my dad's the waste of organs!

29:03.560 --> 29:09.112
Hang on! Look, l've apologised. l've done
what you asked. l've put things right.

29:09.200 --> 29:14.149
Given your choices, it's rich that you
don't like other people living with theirs!

29:30.400 --> 29:32.118
- (Crash)
- Ahhhh!

29:33.480 --> 29:37.473
- Couple of days till I find a flat!
- I promised the wife never again!

29:37.560 --> 29:41.269
- We had to burn that mattress!
- Oh, come on, Paddy, we're mates!

29:41.360 --> 29:45.114
- l'll kip on the floor!
- Definitely not! We've carpets now!

29:53.560 --> 29:56.916
- Are you off?
- lf you lot wanna take the piss, carry on!

29:57.000 --> 29:59.309
- Carry on without me!
- Nobody is.

29:59.400 --> 30:02.676
- I don't like the way I'm being talked to.
- About what?

30:02.760 --> 30:06.514
"When can I have this, Dad?"
All six of you! Yack-yack-fucking-yack!

30:06.600 --> 30:09.831
I'm a single parent!
You wouldn't be here without me!

30:09.920 --> 30:12.912
Surround-sound bitching's
all the thanks I get!

30:13.000 --> 30:17.471
Life's hard, we know that.
Money's hard. I can only stretch it so far.

30:17.560 --> 30:20.518
- Know how much we spend a week?
- The lot!

30:20.600 --> 30:23.956
45 quid. Fiona pays 25,
me and lan go a tenner each.

30:24.040 --> 30:27.396
- Plus gas, plus electric, rent!
- All covered in your Giro.

30:27.480 --> 30:29.835
- Yeah, right.
- 127 a week.

30:29.920 --> 30:31.876
Goes nowhere. You haven't a clue.

30:31.960 --> 30:34.520
Know how much you spend
in The Jockey?

30:34.600 --> 30:38.149
- Hey, none of your business.
- Roughly 80.

30:38.240 --> 30:41.789
Oh, that's my mate Kev giving it that
behind me back!

30:41.880 --> 30:45.634
Well, he's pissed on his own chips!
l'll boycott The Jockey!

30:45.720 --> 30:48.678
- And go where?
- The Crown.

30:48.760 --> 30:50.910
- Barred.
- Elmo's Head.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.355
lt got torched a fortnight back.

30:55.360 --> 30:59.512
l don't need Kev to tell me.
l check your wallet every night.

30:59.600 --> 31:01.352
Go on!

31:03.640 --> 31:06.074
Ah, Frank.

31:06.160 --> 31:08.993
French Frank,
they're calling you on the radio!

31:09.080 --> 31:11.514
Like an eclipse,
Britain went dark without you.

31:11.600 --> 31:15.752
- I'm stuck for a bed, George.
- Oh, come in, the man! Fill in the gaps.

31:16.560 --> 31:18.915
- ls the lad with you?
- He's going home!

31:19.000 --> 31:20.513
(Mouths)

31:28.760 --> 31:31.194
(Sound of Frank being beaten up)

31:40.680 --> 31:43.353
You forgotten you owe him money?

31:43.440 --> 31:46.398
Everybody thinks
l owe 'em fucking money!

31:48.600 --> 31:50.556
He thinks you flogged his telly.

31:50.640 --> 31:54.189
l've been nothing but a friend
to that thick lrish dick!

31:54.280 --> 31:57.716
- I know who you sold it to.
- I won't say it twice. Go home!

31:57.800 --> 32:00.155
- What?
- I won't say it twice!

32:01.400 --> 32:04.073
All right, so people are laughing at you.

32:04.160 --> 32:07.516
They only thought France was a laugh
once they knew you were safe.

32:07.600 --> 32:11.309
The T-shirt I want is "Mug".
I didn't fuck off like your mam did.

32:11.400 --> 32:14.756
I could've shot off
and let the council sort you out. I didn't!

32:14.840 --> 32:20.995
And pubs weren't... Ask anyone.
Odd pint. Three pints, l'd be on the floor.

32:21.080 --> 32:23.674
Brandy made me puke,
whisky gave me a 'eadache.

32:23.760 --> 32:28.914
And they all took the piss then cos
l couldn't knock it back. You can't win!

32:29.000 --> 32:32.151
Your mum fucks off,
you're all looking at me!

32:32.240 --> 32:35.676
Six kids! Six to keep on top of!

32:36.680 --> 32:40.309
You've never had to do stuff before!
Fucking massive!

32:40.400 --> 32:43.358
And clothes for school! Massive!

32:43.440 --> 32:46.079
Having to pick it up as you go along!
Massive!

32:46.160 --> 32:50.153
And me dad's sending her money
cos he's ''always had a soft spot for her''

32:50.240 --> 32:52.196
so now he's saying it's my fault.

32:52.280 --> 32:55.750
Proving it by giving me... What?

32:55.840 --> 32:59.071
Fuck all! He wouldn't even baby-sit!

32:59.160 --> 33:04.234
One long 'eadache cos people
are looking at me like I'm fucking up!

33:05.480 --> 33:07.232
Which I am!

33:07.320 --> 33:11.108
lf you can't do right for doing wrong...
what is the point?

33:11.200 --> 33:15.318
Get a few pints down yer, you know,
getting a round in, getting another.

33:15.400 --> 33:19.552
Nobody's buying you one back, never
will. You've shelled out for hundreds!

33:19.640 --> 33:22.313
Not one back!

33:23.920 --> 33:28.596
But, while you're getting 'em in,
you're havin' a laugh.

33:28.680 --> 33:32.195
l mean, that's all you need, innit?

33:35.160 --> 33:38.436
You know, people laughing,
people talking.

33:38.520 --> 33:41.956
Anything so long as
it's not sounding like six fucking kids

33:42.040 --> 33:44.474
you never wanted in the first place!

33:44.560 --> 33:47.996
Fuck the lot of them!
Get used to the 'eadaches!

33:50.960 --> 33:54.270
(Cheering and applause)

33:54.360 --> 33:56.237
(# Piano: the Marseillaise)

33:56.320 --> 33:58.788
(Shouting and cheering)

34:01.560 --> 34:04.279
Ooh, qu'est-ce que vous voulez,
Mon-suwer?

34:04.360 --> 34:07.033
Pint of bitter and a couple of these.

34:08.400 --> 34:12.154
Oh, twisted Jesus! Kill me!

34:16.760 --> 34:22.197
l don't know you, but it occurred to me
that me and you are the victims here.

34:22.280 --> 34:24.953
Two hard-working, God-fearing men...

34:26.800 --> 34:30.634
who raised children in a straight line
with discipline

34:30.719 --> 34:32.676
and God's good guidance!

34:33.719 --> 34:38.714

using the C word... and on a Sunday!

34:43.120 --> 34:48.148
How did l, a man who said 16 years ago,
''l wanna work for God in Africa...''

34:48.239 --> 34:50.117
Big place, big work!

34:51.600 --> 34:55.911
How did I end up with a woman
whose only pleasures are sex,

34:56.000 --> 35:01.870
TV cookery, and drawing maximum
benefit from the cash-strapped state?

35:01.960 --> 35:05.236
Hundreds a week she gets.
Hundreds! For what?

35:06.880 --> 35:08.836
Being agoraphobic.

35:09.560 --> 35:14.315
l dunno where Sheila's dignity's gone
or whether she ever had any.

35:16.040 --> 35:18.998
Or whether I just kidded meself all along.

35:20.360 --> 35:25.354
Her world's about this big and the less
she does, the more they pay her!

35:26.400 --> 35:29.392
Well, l've done it now. l've left her.

35:29.480 --> 35:33.439
But I refuse to be sorry because...
because...

35:39.120 --> 35:41.270
lt's like...

35:41.360 --> 35:43.749
lt's like cruel to be kind.

35:47.920 --> 35:50.718
lf you're from the church, you've had it.

35:50.800 --> 35:55.078
No...er...they're for you...Sheila.

35:55.160 --> 35:59.039
- You know, by way of an apology.
- Apology? For what?

36:00.080 --> 36:03.755
Er...well, not apology, just...

36:05.640 --> 36:07.790
I'm Frank.

36:07.880 --> 36:10.917
lan's dad...Lip's dad.

36:11.960 --> 36:14.918
- Oh, the twins.
- No.

36:15.960 --> 36:21.273
No, I just... I heard about your bit of
bother. You know, Eddie and all that.

36:22.160 --> 36:26.950
Well, it's just to say that...
not everybody thinks it's hilarious.

36:28.080 --> 36:32.437
- You take no notice.
- That's very neighbourly of you.

36:34.160 --> 36:37.038
Come in...Frank.

36:41.160 --> 36:43.116
You have to take your shoes off!

36:46.200 --> 36:48.873
You've got a belting house, Sheila.

36:50.160 --> 36:52.116
Feels big without him.

36:53.440 --> 36:58.230
Well, you wanna come round ours.
Can't shift the kids, six of 'em!

36:59.720 --> 37:01.676
That must be nice.

37:02.640 --> 37:06.918
Yeah, well, it's great when they're little,
but they're all growing up now.

37:07.760 --> 37:10.832
l mean, you miss that company,
don't you,

37:10.920 --> 37:16.677
when they're all off out all the time
and you're in the house on your own?

37:18.560 --> 37:22.678
Well, no, I mean,
I love... time to meself, you know,

37:22.760 --> 37:26.878
but...l mean, they're are limits.

37:29.960 --> 37:32.235
- Hey!
- No.

37:32.320 --> 37:36.950
Come on, Frank,
you're preaching to the converted here.

37:38.680 --> 37:41.638
l've not been out of the house
in five years.

37:41.720 --> 37:44.439
- Five years?
- I can't.

37:44.520 --> 37:46.715
l've got an overwhelming fear of...

37:47.880 --> 37:49.632
Ooh, God!

37:51.640 --> 37:53.596
l've got agoraph... Oh!

37:53.680 --> 37:59.835
I'm sorry, I know l'm daft about shoes,
but your feet stink to high heaven!

37:59.920 --> 38:04.869
Oh, God, Sheila, sorry!
l'll bugger off out of your way. Sorry!

38:04.960 --> 38:08.999
You see, again, by the time you get
to the bathroom, hot water gone!

38:09.080 --> 38:12.834
I tried running a bath when I got back
from France, hot water gone.

38:12.920 --> 38:15.992
lt's always muggins
having to boil kettles!

38:16.840 --> 38:19.798
- We've hot water.
- Hey, congratu-fucking-lations!

38:19.880 --> 38:22.917
No. ln case you wanted a bath.

38:24.800 --> 38:26.950
Here?

38:27.040 --> 38:28.553
Where in France?

38:41.000 --> 38:43.434
Frank? Frank?

38:43.520 --> 38:48.036
There are clothes out here. Stuck yours
in the wash so I hope they fit.

38:51.160 --> 38:54.709
- Sorry, Sheila, I nodded off.
- You must be exhausted.

38:54.800 --> 38:58.475
- Won't Eddie miss 'em?
- Not unless he sheds four stone.

38:58.560 --> 39:01.438
Found Christ, then barrelled.

39:02.920 --> 39:06.913
- You're quite lean, aren't you?
- I can go for three days without food.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.230
Suits you.

39:10.960 --> 39:13.918
Anyway, they're yours if you want them.

39:18.760 --> 39:21.035
Oh, Jesus!

39:21.120 --> 39:26.433
It's...erm...
something I haven't seen for a long time.

39:29.160 --> 39:31.196
Eddie's only just left, hasn't he?

39:34.600 --> 39:38.912
l've never seen Eddie's.
Always had to be pitch black for Eddie.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.958
l saw an outline once
during a thunderstorm.

39:42.040 --> 39:44.190
Like a pair of rolled-up socks.

39:45.960 --> 39:49.714
So you must be over the moon
with a chap like this.

39:51.240 --> 39:53.879
Hark at her! Desperate Daisy!

39:53.960 --> 39:58.750
Hey, if desperate's a crime,
I'm a lifer, Sheila.

40:01.160 --> 40:03.435
Give it a feel if you're tempted.

40:03.520 --> 40:06.273
No! No, l'll embarrass myself.

40:06.360 --> 40:08.999
Nobody here complaining.

40:18.520 --> 40:21.796
lt's OK, sweetheart, take your time.

40:29.240 --> 40:33.199
- Not looking after each other at all!
- lt's a bit tight, that, Sheila.

40:33.280 --> 40:36.989
Oh, fuck! No, hang on, Sheila,
cos I can't see a thing here!

40:50.800 --> 40:54.429
If I'm embarrassing myself...
I'm doing it right.

40:56.520 --> 40:58.272
Oh...yeah.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.958
So tell... Oh, that is tight!

41:05.680 --> 41:07.193
No... Ow!

41:09.760 --> 41:12.752
Paper said Sagittarius
was in for a quiet week.

41:16.280 --> 41:20.671
So just tell us... No, no! Way too tight!

41:28.640 --> 41:32.189
l...l changed me mind. Sheila...

41:33.880 --> 41:35.836
Just a jump, that's all.

41:37.280 --> 41:39.840
I'm getting a panic attack here.

41:39.920 --> 41:43.151
No! No...no.

41:43.240 --> 41:46.198
Honest to God,
I'm struggling to breathe here.

41:46.280 --> 41:49.192
The more you beg...
the more you're in for.

41:50.360 --> 41:54.638
- Relax, Frank. I said... relax!
- (Whip cracking)

41:55.160 --> 41:57.116
Not that much.

41:59.720 --> 42:01.676
What's...

42:01.760 --> 42:05.514
- lt's fucking vanished!
- Give it time.

42:06.680 --> 42:08.432
We've plenty.

42:13.680 --> 42:15.432
- Yeah.
- See?

42:16.640 --> 42:19.996
- You'll smile for me.
- Yeah, OK.

42:20.080 --> 42:21.832
Yeah...OK.

42:26.520 --> 42:28.476
lt's been over a year.

42:29.760 --> 42:33.355
If that's not a smile, I don't know what is.

42:33.440 --> 42:35.954
Yeah...yeah...

42:39.280 --> 42:42.636
And if he smiles...they all smile.

42:58.920 --> 43:00.876
Sit yourself down.

43:04.400 --> 43:08.951
- When did this get done?
- Stuck the chops on at about seven.

43:09.040 --> 43:12.032
Snuck back about ten to peel the spuds.

43:12.120 --> 43:14.554
What time is it?

43:14.640 --> 43:17.154
For fuck's sake, what did you slip us?

43:17.240 --> 43:21.791
Just natural tiredness, Frank.
lt's probably jet lag.

43:22.760 --> 43:25.877
You went to sleep...just staring.

43:28.960 --> 43:32.919
Look at the good it's done you.
You look like you've got blusher on!

43:42.800 --> 43:45.473
(Television theme tune playing)

43:50.960 --> 43:53.155
(Mobile phone ringing)

43:55.720 --> 43:58.029
(Mobile phone ringing)

43:58.880 --> 44:02.998
- (Both) I haven't got one.
- (Liam) I've got one.

44:03.800 --> 44:07.759
- Are you contract or pay-as-you-go?
- (Phone ringing)

44:12.320 --> 44:13.275
Hello?

44:30.760 --> 44:35.515
I'm the only child my father's scared of
because I'm the total opposite

44:35.600 --> 44:37.955
because I wanted to be.

44:42.400 --> 44:44.755
You're... You're kind of...

44:45.840 --> 44:48.513
You're kind of me in a skirt.

44:48.600 --> 44:52.673
l don't honestly believe
we could get this lucky twice.

44:53.800 --> 44:57.679
Anyway...skirt or no skirt...

45:00.480 --> 45:02.630
these are for you.

45:27.040 --> 45:31.830
(Fiona) 'Reactions to the loss were
mixed. Debbie missed him like mad

45:31.920 --> 45:36.471
'till she realised he was only a walk away
and Sheila was lovely.'

45:36.560 --> 45:40.348
Right... Go on, go on, now!
Go on, now! Deb, get out the way!

45:40.440 --> 45:44.149
'Dad would need skivvies
wherever he ended up.

45:44.240 --> 45:49.189
'He was in parasite heaven, returning
only on Fridays eight to eight-thirty,

45:49.280 --> 45:54.115
'bringing new-found parenting skills

'Every time it looked like this family
was falling apart,

'next time you looked,
we'd doubled the numbers.

'Sheila's wasn't Sheila's any more,
it was where Dad lived.

'lt was his house - Dad and Sheila's.
Part of the Gallagher colony.

46:12.960 --> 46:16.509
'We'd always be welcome
so long as money wasn't an issue,

46:16.600 --> 46:21.754
'which seemed fair enough...cos we got
more floor space to ourselves.'

46:37.560 --> 46:40.757
Near the top, Deb. Bit of bird shit.

46:42.120 --> 46:44.076
There, on the right.

46:45.360 --> 46:47.715
More...up... More on the right.

46:48.360 --> 46:50.510
Hey, watch the ladder.

46:50.600 --> 46:53.160
lf you can't be good, start saving!

46:53.760 --> 46:55.716
(Frank laughing)

47:07.040 --> 47:09.156
Me and Kev are getting married!

47:11.160 --> 47:14.470
We'll still be married,
it just won't be legal!

47:14.560 --> 47:17.438
- (Laughter)
- He's a maniac! He came at me!

47:17.520 --> 47:21.433
- He'll burn down the bleeding house!
- How long's it take to get a divorce?
