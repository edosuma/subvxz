00:02.373 --> 00:05.763
Jackie, now how you gonna play me?
You left me in charge here.

00:05.973 --> 00:09.170
- How come you can't trust me?
- Because I grew up with you.

00:09.333 --> 00:11.051
Now, did you do everything
on my list?

00:11.373 --> 00:13.091
Well, yeah, Miss Daisy.

00:13.253 --> 00:18.452
I cleaned the windows. I cleaned
the floor. I even cleaned the ceiling.

00:19.333 --> 00:23.087
Hey, look, you are talking to one
tired freshman here, Miss Boss Lady.

00:23.253 --> 00:24.402
<i>Well, I am impressed.</i>

00:24.573 --> 00:27.212
As well you should be.
Shame on you not trusting me.

00:27.373 --> 00:28.931
Now, you kick butt in that game.

00:29.093 --> 00:30.970
<i>- All right, bye.
- Bye bye.</i>

00:32.293 --> 00:34.727
Hey. Good job, Harold.

00:35.893 --> 00:40.045
Hey, you know, Agnes. I don't know
why your daughter doesn't call you.

00:41.253 --> 00:43.721
Hey. Break time's over, Sol.

01:53.773 --> 01:56.571
Look, sweetheart, you can't spend
every moment with Nicky.

01:56.773 --> 01:58.968
You have to get over this
separation anxiety.

01:59.133 --> 02:00.885
You went through it with Carlton.

02:01.053 --> 02:03.089
Yes, and look at how well
he turned out.

02:10.333 --> 02:12.722
You must be very proud.

02:14.173 --> 02:16.368
Vivian, sweetheart...

02:16.533 --> 02:19.001
...I love you and I miss you.

02:19.173 --> 02:22.563
And that's why we're going to have
lunch this afternoon at La Teau.

02:22.733 --> 02:23.882
Oh, I'd love to, honey.

02:24.053 --> 02:26.692
But I don't think Nicky
is ready for restaurants yet.

02:26.853 --> 02:28.889
I was talking about us, Vivian.

02:29.053 --> 02:30.281
We're going to kiss.

02:30.453 --> 02:35.049
We're going to have a romantic,
baby-free good time.

02:35.213 --> 02:37.522
Uncle Phil, I think you should be
more concerned...

02:37.693 --> 02:39.843
...with a cholesterol-free good time.

02:40.053 --> 02:41.805
And one of you will babysit.

02:42.213 --> 02:44.169
Big poopy.

02:47.533 --> 02:50.969
- What did you say?
- Oh, I said:

02:51.133 --> 02:53.966
"Beg, puppy"...

02:54.973 --> 02:57.692
...to my pretend dog, Ernie.

03:00.933 --> 03:02.491
Fetch, Ernie.

03:05.613 --> 03:07.285
He's gone now.

03:08.973 --> 03:12.283
Philip, honey, can I speak
to you a minute, please?

03:12.493 --> 03:14.245
Is this a good idea, honey?

03:14.413 --> 03:19.885
Do you think we can rely on them
to take care of the B-A-B-Y?

03:20.053 --> 03:21.884
Who's Bobby?

03:29.333 --> 03:31.324
The baby.

03:31.493 --> 03:34.565
Mom, his name is Nicky.

03:37.013 --> 03:38.412
I'm staying home.

03:38.573 --> 03:40.609
Come on, Geoffrey will take care
of the baby.

03:40.773 --> 03:43.970
Come on, let's go. You only have
four and a half hours to say goodbye.

03:44.133 --> 03:48.092
Not to worry, madam. I'll care for the
child as though he were my very own.

03:48.773 --> 03:52.049
We'll draw straws for the little bugger.
Short one loses.

03:52.253 --> 03:54.528
Oh, that would be you, Carlton.

03:55.493 --> 03:58.007
Har-de-har-har, but I've got a class.

03:58.173 --> 04:00.164
Well, wait a minute, I've got a job.

04:00.333 --> 04:01.448
I've got a match.

04:01.613 --> 04:03.092
I've got...

04:04.413 --> 04:07.485
A date with Mr. Stinky!

04:12.453 --> 04:14.683
Two cappuccinos, please.

04:16.012 --> 04:20.211
Well, I'm hoping you like it
dark, hot, sweet...

04:20.413 --> 04:23.610
...and with a spoon in it.

04:27.053 --> 04:28.532
Could you hurry it up, please?

04:28.693 --> 04:31.491
I told that guy over there
I'd buy him some coffee.

04:31.853 --> 04:37.132
Poor Todd. Trying to raise his baby
all alone, hold down a job, go to school.

04:37.293 --> 04:39.090
I think it's just adorable.

04:39.533 --> 04:41.012
You do? I'm the same, baby.

04:41.173 --> 04:43.892
I mean, I'm holding down a job
and going to school.

04:44.053 --> 04:47.807
About that baby part, if you ain't
doing nothing later, I'm...

04:48.693 --> 04:50.445
Will, you've gotta help me.

04:50.613 --> 04:53.207
I took Nicky shopping,
but I can't try anything on.

04:53.373 --> 04:57.969
I mean, he just lies there
watching me get undressed...

04:58.133 --> 05:01.569
...and making these tiny little
drool bubbles and...

05:01.853 --> 05:03.684
He reminds me of Trevor.

05:05.133 --> 05:07.966
- So you take him.
- Wait, wai... Whoa, hold up, girl.

05:08.133 --> 05:11.011
I'm working this place by myself.
Jackie's at an away game.

05:11.213 --> 05:14.410
And I ain't got no time
for no " give me my bottle...

05:14.573 --> 05:16.529
...and change my didy."

05:18.013 --> 05:21.210
"Wipe my booty."

05:22.413 --> 05:25.485
Oh, Will, your little boy
is just adorable.

05:25.653 --> 05:29.646
<i>Well, like padre, like nino,
you know what I'm saying?</i>

05:29.813 --> 05:31.849
All right, break it up.

05:32.013 --> 05:35.562
Move on. Nothing to see here.
Show's over.

05:35.733 --> 05:37.371
Beat it!

05:37.973 --> 05:39.452
- Hi.
- Hi, hey.

05:39.613 --> 05:40.887
I'm Candace.

05:41.053 --> 05:43.408
Could I get a picture of you
and your son together?

05:43.573 --> 05:45.086
Oh, yeah, sure.

05:48.053 --> 05:50.567
How do you manage
being a single father?

05:50.733 --> 05:52.405
Doesn't it get lonely?

05:52.573 --> 05:54.211
Well...

05:54.533 --> 05:57.366
You know, the nights is kind of bad.

05:57.973 --> 06:00.407
You know, because I have to be both
Mommy and Daddy...

06:00.613 --> 06:02.490
...to little Willie Junior here
since...

06:02.653 --> 06:04.769
Since Tirisha died.

06:06.093 --> 06:08.732
That's it. I'm not gonna stand
another minute and listen...

06:08.893 --> 06:13.603
- Hey! Isn't that who played Greg Brady?!
- Where? Hey, Greg, wait up!

06:18.413 --> 06:20.802
You are quite a guy, Will.

06:21.013 --> 06:23.004
Just tell me everything about you.

06:24.173 --> 06:26.004
You mean, you want to be our friend?

06:26.173 --> 06:27.970
Yeah.

06:28.133 --> 06:31.887
Hey, little Willie,
we made a new friend.

06:34.133 --> 06:37.648
And she can sleep over
any time she wants to.

06:43.573 --> 06:46.963
Hi, honey, your dad and I just had
the most romantic lunch.

06:47.173 --> 06:50.085
Romantic? I don't mean
to be critical, Vivian...

06:50.253 --> 06:53.723
...but you did mention the baby,
what, three or four dozen times?

06:54.053 --> 06:56.851
It was so romantic when
you asked that strolling violinist...

06:57.013 --> 06:58.366
...to play my favorite song.

06:58.533 --> 06:59.522
Yes.

06:59.693 --> 07:01.046
And what did you request?

07:01.213 --> 07:03.602
"The Wheels on the Bus
Go Round and Round."

07:08.453 --> 07:10.205
Vivian.

07:10.373 --> 07:11.852
We used to go to a restaurant...

07:12.013 --> 07:14.322
...and not even be able
to make it to the table.

07:14.533 --> 07:18.492
You remember the cloakroom
at Mario's Peruvian?

07:18.773 --> 07:23.449
Excuse me, but when did I get
old enough to hear this?

07:24.853 --> 07:26.332
Excuse me.

07:26.533 --> 07:27.761
Geoffrey, where's the baby?

07:27.933 --> 07:29.332
The baby?

07:29.493 --> 07:31.529
The baby.

07:31.733 --> 07:34.930
Actually, Miss Hilary insisted
on taking him out for the afternoon.

07:35.093 --> 07:38.290
And since the poor girl's still
so depressed about Trevor...

07:38.533 --> 07:40.683
...I hadn't the heart to refuse.

07:40.853 --> 07:42.605
Hi, everybody.

07:44.173 --> 07:48.132
Geoffrey, could you give me a hand?
I left the most important thing in the car.

07:48.333 --> 07:50.642
Hilary. You left the baby
alone in the car?

07:50.813 --> 07:52.883
Mother, I would never do that.

07:53.053 --> 07:54.930
How irresponsible do you think I am?

07:55.093 --> 07:56.572
Well, then where's the baby?

07:56.733 --> 07:58.485
I don't know.

08:00.333 --> 08:02.369
Mom, you have to see
these earrings I bought.

08:02.533 --> 08:04.489
- The little diamonds spell out...
- Hilary!

08:04.653 --> 08:07.121
How did you know?

08:07.293 --> 08:11.047
- Hey, hey, hey.
- My baby, come to Mommy.

08:11.253 --> 08:13.244
Coming, Mommy.

08:16.973 --> 08:18.565
Well, wait a minute, Will.

08:18.733 --> 08:22.521
How did you get hold of the baby?
Wasn't Hilary supposed to watch him?

08:23.093 --> 08:25.288
- Hilary?
- What?

08:25.453 --> 08:28.126
Oh, God, it's not like
I left him at Sizzler...

08:28.293 --> 08:30.011
...Dad.

08:36.732 --> 08:38.803
Last time I do you people any favors.

08:39.293 --> 08:42.568
Don't worry, Nicky,
Mommy's got you now.

08:47.573 --> 08:51.088
The only way I'm gonna get attention
here is if I start wearing diapers.

08:51.293 --> 08:54.490
No, Uncle Phil, you got at least
five years before you need them.

08:58.893 --> 09:01.043
Vivian.

09:01.973 --> 09:05.727
After what you did, I don't even know
how you could look me in the eye.

09:05.893 --> 09:07.246
Easy, like this:

09:07.453 --> 09:08.932
Hey.

09:09.093 --> 09:11.482
Look, I won't let you use Nicky
for evil anymore.

09:11.693 --> 09:13.445
Next time I'm going
to the authorities.

09:13.813 --> 09:16.486
Thanks for the warning,
Captain Weenie.

09:19.853 --> 09:21.491
- Will Smith?
- Yeah.

09:21.693 --> 09:23.445
Well, hello.

09:23.613 --> 09:25.843
Buy you lunch today, Daddy?

09:26.013 --> 09:27.844
Yeah, sure.

09:37.613 --> 09:40.286
Man, this is an embarrassment
of riches.

09:40.453 --> 09:41.522
But what about me?

09:41.693 --> 09:43.809
You just an embarrassment, man.

09:44.173 --> 09:45.401
Hi, guys.

09:45.573 --> 09:48.133
Jackie, what's up? Let me get that.
How was the game?

09:48.293 --> 09:50.853
- We won.
- Ta-da.

09:51.493 --> 09:55.281
So, what's been going on here?
Anything unusual?

09:55.493 --> 09:57.324
No, no, actually,
it's been pretty quiet.

09:57.493 --> 09:58.687
Good, cool.

09:58.853 --> 10:02.368
So before I forget, would you
sign the school paper for me?

10:02.533 --> 10:03.761
Right next to your picture.

10:03.973 --> 10:07.443
Oh, yeah, sure, I don't see why n...

10:12.293 --> 10:15.603
No!

10:21.093 --> 10:22.572
Oh, boy, are you in trouble.

10:22.853 --> 10:25.128
And I'd like to say,
"Hey, I'm here for you"...

10:25.293 --> 10:27.249
...but, heck, I'd be lying.

10:30.413 --> 10:34.531
Look, it's just this little blurb
in some dumb school newspaper!

10:34.693 --> 10:36.365
Freeze.

10:36.533 --> 10:39.764
Don't be coming over here
with no attitude.

10:39.933 --> 10:42.083
This ain't my fault.

10:42.253 --> 10:44.130
- Whose was it then?
- Well, yours.

10:44.373 --> 10:46.364
- What?
- You heard me.

10:46.613 --> 10:50.083
I'm saying, you know
I can't be trusted.

10:50.373 --> 10:53.490
You wouldn't have left me here,
none of this would ever happen.

10:53.653 --> 10:56.725
That's it. I didn't come all the way here
from Philly to hear this.

10:56.893 --> 10:59.691
- I am tired! Get out of my face!
- Don't be up in my grill!

10:59.853 --> 11:02.765
- You need to shut... I'm out of here!
- Excuse me, excuse me!

11:02.933 --> 11:04.082
You know what?

11:04.253 --> 11:05.925
- You ain't never gonna change!
- Never gonna change!

11:06.093 --> 11:07.526
- I'm getting the last word!
- I'm getting the last word!

11:07.693 --> 11:09.763
- Oh, no, you're not! Oh, yes, I am!
- Oh, no, you're not! Oh, yes, I am!

11:09.973 --> 11:11.531
- Damn!
- Damn!

11:19.613 --> 11:21.763
- Will, hi.
- What?!

11:22.693 --> 11:25.810
Hey, how are you doing? That's right.

11:25.973 --> 11:30.967
- A beautiful woman here to see me!
- I should've told you I'm on the paper.

11:31.133 --> 11:34.443
- Hope you're not mad.
- Mad? No, I ain't mad.

11:34.613 --> 11:38.083
- Then why are you yelling?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I got...

11:38.253 --> 11:41.245
I got a slight hearing problem.

11:41.453 --> 11:45.492
Deficiency, you know,
from my night job at the target range.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.170
Oh, you poor thing.

11:48.333 --> 11:49.925
Listen, I got a class now.

11:50.093 --> 11:52.846
Could you meet me here
tomorrow morning, say, around 9:00?

11:53.053 --> 11:54.247
- Yeah, sure.
- Cool.

11:54.453 --> 11:56.489
Because I'd love to see
that baby again.

11:59.413 --> 12:01.847
I think he has plans.

12:02.413 --> 12:05.325
Oh, well, that's too bad
because I was thinking...

12:05.493 --> 12:08.803
...maybe the three of us could do
something really special together.

12:08.973 --> 12:12.852
And then while he's taking
his little nappy, who knows?

12:13.453 --> 12:16.525
Well, he just a baby.
How important could his plans be?

12:17.333 --> 12:19.642
- You're so cute.
- I know, I know, ain't I?

12:19.853 --> 12:25.246
Okay, so I'll meet you here at 9:00
and you won't be sorry.

12:30.733 --> 12:33.167
Oh, I know I won't be sorry...

12:34.413 --> 12:36.768
...because I got me a woman!

12:38.253 --> 12:40.972
All I need is me a baby.

12:44.813 --> 12:47.771
- Hi, baby.
- Hello, dear.

12:48.613 --> 12:49.841
Are you talking to me?

12:50.013 --> 12:52.049
Of course I am.

12:52.573 --> 12:55.133
I know I've been ignoring you lately.

12:55.293 --> 12:58.330
So would you let me
make it up to you?

13:00.453 --> 13:02.284
Maybe.

13:09.893 --> 13:11.963
Oh, all right.

13:12.133 --> 13:14.931
I've seen you both naked anyway.

13:19.653 --> 13:24.852
Sweetheart, I have rented us a suite
at the Bel-Air Hotel for tonight.

13:25.013 --> 13:27.243
Now, Carlton is gonna
take care of Nicky...

13:27.453 --> 13:30.206
...so I can take care of you.

13:34.373 --> 13:36.250
All right, that's it.

13:36.413 --> 13:40.088
That's it. I'm tired of this. Y'all two
need some time alone, okay?

13:40.293 --> 13:43.251
You gonna leave Nicky here.
You gonna go get a fly hotel suite.

13:43.413 --> 13:46.052
You gonna chill. You ain't
coming back here till tomorrow.

13:46.213 --> 13:47.931
Come on, let's go pack.

13:52.733 --> 13:56.521
Philip, this is so wonderful.

13:57.133 --> 14:01.649
I have been working so hard,
taking care of the baby night and day.

14:01.813 --> 14:05.010
Yes, well, you just lay back and relax
and let Daddy take care of you.

14:05.173 --> 14:07.129
Dim the lights, Vivian.

14:19.733 --> 14:22.167
Yes, baby.

14:26.053 --> 14:27.532
You know, sweetheart.

14:28.333 --> 14:30.369
For the longest time,
I've had the feeling...

14:30.573 --> 14:34.043
...that the fire in our marriage
had gone out.

14:34.213 --> 14:35.851
But now I know...

14:36.013 --> 14:39.562
...that the flame still burns.

14:39.733 --> 14:43.885
Can't get enough of your love, baby.

14:46.933 --> 14:48.571
Vivian?

14:53.173 --> 14:54.811
Vivian.

14:57.053 --> 14:58.566
Vivian.

15:02.413 --> 15:04.324
Okay, look, Nicky,
this is very important.

15:04.533 --> 15:06.125
Come on, repeat after me:

15:06.333 --> 15:08.528
"Da Da"?

15:09.573 --> 15:11.564
Oh, man.

15:12.853 --> 15:14.650
Oh, hey, sorry, my man,
it's only 9:00.

15:14.813 --> 15:16.804
Place doesn't open up till 10.

15:17.053 --> 15:18.281
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:18.453 --> 15:20.967
I kind of lost track of time
since I pawned my watch.

15:21.653 --> 15:23.848
No, I don't need to bother
you with my problems.

15:24.053 --> 15:26.931
No, hey, hold up, man,
it's cool. Here, have a seat right here.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.412
There you go.

15:30.253 --> 15:33.450
Got a little something for you
on the house.

15:34.013 --> 15:36.652
- Thank you.
- Hey, least I can do, man.

15:36.813 --> 15:38.246
You're my inspiration.

15:39.613 --> 15:40.648
Caught you.

15:40.813 --> 15:44.647
Oh, no, it's Captain Weenie
and his bag of tricks.

15:45.613 --> 15:46.966
You're despicable.

15:47.133 --> 15:50.648
I went to check up on my little brother
this morning and what did I find?

15:50.813 --> 15:53.373
A zucchini. A zucchini, Will.

15:53.533 --> 15:55.888
Well, I've had enough
of your twisted charade.

15:57.293 --> 15:58.646
Hey, man, what are you doing?

15:58.813 --> 16:00.041
Taking you down, mister.

16:00.213 --> 16:03.091
I'm calling Mom and Dad
at the Bel-Air Hotel.

16:04.333 --> 16:06.483
You got change for a dollar?

16:07.013 --> 16:09.447
Oh, no, see, you gotta
buy something.

16:09.693 --> 16:12.207
Okay, give me a pack of gum.

16:12.453 --> 16:14.569
Sorry, we're closed.

16:14.813 --> 16:17.725
Well, there's a world of change
out there, mister...

16:17.893 --> 16:20.043
...and I'm going to find it.

16:22.173 --> 16:23.401
Good morning, Will.

16:23.573 --> 16:26.167
I'm so glad you could make it.
And little Willie too.

16:27.053 --> 16:30.489
Yeah, we came here
straight from church.

16:31.253 --> 16:34.450
What's up with that special
somethin'-somethin' you promised me?

16:34.853 --> 16:36.525
- Okay, close your eyes.
- Okay.

16:36.693 --> 16:41.642
Now, I knew you wouldn't agree to this
if I hadn't kept it a surprise.

16:41.893 --> 16:44.168
A surprise?
What you talking about?

16:44.333 --> 16:45.766
- Surprise!
- Hey, man.

16:46.533 --> 16:50.811
<i>Will Smith, you are live here
on the Hart File Show.</i>

16:50.973 --> 16:56.923
I'm your host, Jake Maxwell.
And this is ULA's Father Of The Year.

16:57.133 --> 16:59.966
Guess you're pretty excited,
huh, Will?

17:02.213 --> 17:04.568
Sorry, we're closed.

17:04.933 --> 17:06.605
Be open at 10.

17:13.252 --> 17:15.289
Yeah, you better wake up, Vivian.

17:15.453 --> 17:18.684
Olive Oyl is looking awfully good
right now.

17:19.653 --> 17:23.726
Oh, sweetie, I am sorry I fell asleep
last night.

17:23.893 --> 17:25.121
But guess what.

17:25.333 --> 17:26.766
I'm wide awake now.

17:26.933 --> 17:28.685
Quit it, quit it.
I am not in the mood.

17:28.853 --> 17:31.526
Just move. You're blocking Bluto.

17:32.173 --> 17:34.164
I'm gonna go freshen up.

17:34.333 --> 17:36.893
Why don't you turn on
some more of that music.

17:37.053 --> 17:38.611
Oh, yeah, right.

17:39.693 --> 17:42.924
<i>Will Smith, what's it like being
a single father here in L.A.?</i>

17:43.093 --> 17:45.527
<i>You know, I'm saying, you know,
it ain 't easy.</i>

17:45.693 --> 17:47.968
<i>You know, being
a single father like me.</i>

17:48.173 --> 17:52.644
<i>But little Willie... Will... Willie Junior
here makes everything worthwhile.</i>

17:53.213 --> 17:55.522
- Did you see my...?
- Let's dance, Vivian, huh?

17:55.693 --> 18:00.005
- Oh, Philip, what in the world...?
- Nothing. Nothing.

18:02.253 --> 18:03.971
That's my baby.

18:05.733 --> 18:07.769
That's my zucchini.

18:10.413 --> 18:13.962
<i>Daddy Will, the Hart File wants
to make your life a little easier.</i>

18:14.173 --> 18:19.770
So here's a year's supply
of baby products for your son.

18:19.933 --> 18:21.605
Oh, this is ridiculous.

18:21.813 --> 18:23.326
What does he know about babies?

18:23.573 --> 18:26.326
This is his idea of a baby.

18:26.493 --> 18:28.723
Get that fruitcake out of here.

18:29.053 --> 18:30.327
Hey!

18:30.813 --> 18:32.610
Listen, I don't deserve all this stuff.

18:32.773 --> 18:35.412
That's right, young fella,
you deserve a whole lot more.

18:35.573 --> 18:41.682
So how's about a holiday in Hawaii?

18:41.893 --> 18:45.283
Oh, look, I can't...
I'm sorry, did you say Hawaii?

18:45.493 --> 18:48.883
Will, if it's not too painful,
could you tell the folks at home...

18:49.053 --> 18:51.044
...a little bit about Tirisha?

18:51.253 --> 18:52.481
Who?

18:52.693 --> 18:55.651
Tirisha, your son's mother.

18:57.093 --> 19:00.722
That Tirisha. Yes, she's dead now.

19:00.893 --> 19:06.889
I met her after I got back
from fighting them oil fires, in Kuwait.

19:07.053 --> 19:09.487
You know, and my hair,
my eyebrows and everything...

19:09.653 --> 19:12.406
...had just started growing back.
General Powell said to me:

19:12.573 --> 19:15.371
"Yo, homey, you need
to get down with a little R and R...

19:15.533 --> 19:17.524
...because you're looking
a little singed."

19:17.693 --> 19:22.642
So in China... He sent me to China.
And then that's where we met.

19:22.813 --> 19:25.611
It was in a little-known
province called...

19:25.773 --> 19:27.843
...Rae Dawn Chong.

19:29.693 --> 19:31.365
And...

19:34.613 --> 19:36.490
Well, sayonara.

19:38.493 --> 19:42.771
Come on, Will, could you tell us
more of your touching story?

19:44.173 --> 19:45.492
I'll just take him out.

19:45.733 --> 19:48.406
But, no, no. Hold... Hold up
a second, man.

19:50.853 --> 19:52.730
Look, by a show of hands here...

19:52.893 --> 19:55.726
...how many of y'all
got a sense of humor, huh?

20:04.733 --> 20:08.362
All right, look, I ain't no
father of the year.

20:09.133 --> 20:11.283
I'm not even a father.

20:12.373 --> 20:14.807
I made all of this stuff up.

20:15.013 --> 20:16.526
And I'm kind of good at that.

20:18.133 --> 20:20.567
This is my cousin Nicky.

20:20.733 --> 20:23.770
And I don't deserve
all these gifts.

20:24.893 --> 20:26.963
But this dude here,
this guy here, I mean...

20:27.133 --> 20:29.806
He's the real single father
with the real problems.

20:29.973 --> 20:32.328
Give him all the stuff.

20:33.333 --> 20:34.561
Hawaii too?

20:34.733 --> 20:37.725
No, homey, I thought I'd
hang on to Hawaii, you know...

20:38.733 --> 20:41.406
Hawaii too.

20:42.413 --> 20:46.201
And that's another heartwarming
moment from...

20:46.893 --> 20:48.724
<i>...the Hart File.</i>

20:48.893 --> 20:50.212
Are we off?

20:50.373 --> 20:52.329
Somebody get me a drink.

20:58.773 --> 21:00.092
You creep.

21:00.293 --> 21:04.172
Just wait till you see what I write
about you in tomorrow's paper.

21:04.333 --> 21:06.005
But, baby, I...

21:08.173 --> 21:09.401
See?

21:09.573 --> 21:11.643
I can tell the truth.

21:13.333 --> 21:16.689
I'm saying, you know,
maybe there's a little hope for me yet?

21:17.413 --> 21:19.324
Very little.

21:23.013 --> 21:26.289
Will, I'm out of here. I just want
to say thank you one more time.

21:26.453 --> 21:29.684
Hey, no problem, man. It actually
makes me feel good...

21:29.853 --> 21:32.048
...to do something for somebody
who needed it.

21:32.213 --> 21:35.523
I was starting to feel stank
claiming that as my baby and everything.

21:35.693 --> 21:38.207
Yeah, I know what you mean.
See...

21:38.413 --> 21:40.449
...this ain't my kid either.

21:40.933 --> 21:42.651
Aloha.

21:46.413 --> 21:48.483
Oh, see, that's so wrong.

21:53.653 --> 21:58.568
You know, Will, if you had pulled a stunt
like this when you were in high school...

21:58.733 --> 22:00.530
...God knows what
I would've done.

22:00.693 --> 22:03.605
Why, I might've done
something like this:

22:13.253 --> 22:16.450
I went to check on my little brother
and you know what I found?

22:16.613 --> 22:18.683
A zucchi... A zucchini.

22:22.573 --> 22:24.882
What? I'm sorry, I didn't hear
what you found.

22:25.133 --> 22:27.203
A zucchini, Will.

22:32.413 --> 22:34.210
<i>Good luck, Captain Weenie.</i>
