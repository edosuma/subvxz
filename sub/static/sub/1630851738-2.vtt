WEBVTT

00:47.130 --> 00:48.381
Everything okay, miss?

00:52.343 --> 00:54.345
Need me to call somebody for you?

00:59.184 --> 01:00.560
It's freezing out here.

01:01.186 --> 01:02.687
Let's get you out of the cold.

01:54.239 --> 01:55.406
Did it work?

02:05.792 --> 02:06.709
Come on.

02:07.252 --> 02:08.211
Hurry up.

02:18.930 --> 02:20.890
-I really hate that thing.
-So do I.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.852
I had to do something about it.
It kept coming after me.

02:29.816 --> 02:30.650
Get back!

02:33.111 --> 02:35.989
All right, ugly.
Here's a little fisherman for ya.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.166
I don't know.
I thought that key was badass.

02:46.249 --> 02:47.375
The goal…

02:48.918 --> 02:52.922
…wasn't to turn him
into a pile of mush and bones.

02:57.343 --> 03:00.346
I've only got enough Whispering Iron left
to make one more.

03:01.306 --> 03:02.849
I need to get this right.

03:02.932 --> 03:04.475
How are you gonna do that?

03:10.231 --> 03:12.150
By going straight to the source.

03:14.527 --> 03:15.486
The Lockes.

03:34.631 --> 03:35.757
Fifth grade, huh?

03:36.758 --> 03:38.718
It's time to finally make some friends.

03:38.801 --> 03:40.470
Hey, I was kind of busy last year

03:41.221 --> 03:42.805
doing battle with a demon.

03:42.889 --> 03:44.307
I'm just giving you shit.

03:44.390 --> 03:48.561
We all… We all had a lot of distractions
last year, but this year you're free,

03:48.645 --> 03:51.898
so, you know,
go and be a social butterfly.

03:51.981 --> 03:54.901
There's a girl in my class
who has a phobia of butterflies.

03:54.984 --> 03:57.028
Just do the social part, then.

03:57.111 --> 03:58.738
You're gonna do great, bud.

03:58.821 --> 04:00.365
Here, I made you lunch.

04:00.865 --> 04:02.867
Oh, Kins, that is so sweet.

04:02.951 --> 04:05.161
Make sure you get a parking pass
from Bernadette.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.622
If you don't, she has a power trip
about getting people towed.

04:07.705 --> 04:08.706
Parking pass. Got it.

04:08.790 --> 04:11.209
Don't use the soda machine
in the field house. It eats dollars.

04:11.292 --> 04:12.669
-You can text us.
-We'll be there.

04:12.752 --> 04:13.670
Guys.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.213
I got it.

04:23.805 --> 04:27.767
So not only is Mom gonna be on campus,
this is your last first day of school.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.186
I am planning on going to college.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.854
I know, but that's different.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.526
How's Jackie?

04:38.736 --> 04:39.696
Uh…

04:40.363 --> 04:43.366
Yesterday, she, uh…
she showed me this memory of

04:44.158 --> 04:47.328
Eden somehow sweet-talking a cop into
letting them out of a speeding ticket.

04:47.412 --> 04:49.622
It was-- It was great.
It was totally normal.

04:50.540 --> 04:54.794
Uh, when I brought it up later,
she had no idea what I was talking about.

04:55.461 --> 04:58.631
Imagine going into Gabe's head
and having him completely forget.

05:04.178 --> 05:06.389
I've actually never been inside his head.

05:08.933 --> 05:12.478
-But you went into Scot's head, right?
-Well, yeah, but I don't know.

05:12.562 --> 05:15.481
It hasn't really come up with Gabe.
Is that weird?

05:15.565 --> 05:17.567
-Only if it's weird to you.

05:24.615 --> 05:25.658
Wait up!

05:37.462 --> 05:38.296
Hey!

05:40.465 --> 05:43.176
Welcome to the upper class.

05:50.058 --> 05:52.101
-You're in a good mood.
-Why wouldn't I be?

05:52.185 --> 05:55.021
We're juniors now,
and we got a partial standing ovation

05:55.104 --> 05:58.816
for premiering what has gotta be
the second-best lobster movie of all time.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.360
What's the first best?

06:00.443 --> 06:01.569
-The Lobster?

06:01.652 --> 06:05.156
-There aren't any lobsters in that movie.
-Okay, so then we win.

06:05.239 --> 06:06.157
And to celebrate,

06:06.240 --> 06:09.660
I got us dinner reservations for tonight
at Stan's Pizza.

06:09.744 --> 06:11.996
I didn't know Stan's
even took reservations.

06:12.080 --> 06:12.997
Usually they don't,

06:13.081 --> 06:16.042
but they made an exception
for a high roller such as myself.

06:16.125 --> 06:18.961
That sticky table next to the dartboard?
That's all ours.

06:19.045 --> 06:21.005
Oh. How could a girl say no to that?

06:30.473 --> 06:31.682
Wow.

06:33.142 --> 06:36.145
This place is incredible.

06:36.229 --> 06:39.190
High Victorian Gothic at, uh,

06:40.483 --> 06:42.026
well, its highest.

06:43.111 --> 06:47.198
I'm guessing from the looks of it,
it was built 1860s, 1870s?

06:47.281 --> 06:50.576
1877. Impressive.

06:50.660 --> 06:52.745
Well, full disclosure, I teach history.

06:52.829 --> 06:56.624
Ah. Sadly, this place
hasn't been kept up too well.

06:56.707 --> 07:00.086
Hence why I've been hired
by a patron of the arts to restore it.

07:00.169 --> 07:01.379
I'm Nina.

07:01.462 --> 07:03.631
Josh. Nice to meet you.

07:04.715 --> 07:06.759
-Do you mind if I…
-No, go ahead.

07:10.930 --> 07:13.182
Yep, you clearly know what you're doing.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.225
Thank you.

07:14.308 --> 07:17.728
I mostly restore old houses,
but I'm excited to expand.

07:17.812 --> 07:19.439
Except for this.

07:19.522 --> 07:20.523
Excuse me?

07:21.023 --> 07:23.526
Carpet runners
covering up these floors.

07:23.609 --> 07:25.403
This is original hardwood.

07:25.486 --> 07:29.031
This is chestnut.
You can't even get new chestnut anymore.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.825
I'm aware of that. But I also can't--

07:30.908 --> 07:34.245
These are from trees that, back then,
were three, four hundred years old.

07:34.328 --> 07:37.039
That means they started growing
in pre-Columbian times.

07:37.123 --> 07:39.292
Doesn't that just kill you?

07:40.418 --> 07:42.295
Yes… it's amazing.

07:42.378 --> 07:46.507
But I also can't just
disregard the practical concerns.

07:46.591 --> 07:47.884
This is a performance space,

07:47.967 --> 07:50.219
and the acoustics
are incredibly important.

07:50.303 --> 07:53.181
You wouldn't cover
the Hope Diamond in duct tape, would you?

07:53.264 --> 07:56.392
Even if somebody did try to convince you
that it was practical.

07:57.727 --> 07:59.812
I'm just saying, let's not forget to show

08:00.313 --> 08:03.024
respect for our historical treasures.

08:03.107 --> 08:04.108
Right.

08:04.609 --> 08:05.610
Respect.

08:06.402 --> 08:07.945
Thanks for reminding me.

08:09.197 --> 08:11.866
I'm gonna get back to doing my job now.

08:11.949 --> 08:13.993
Maybe you should go and do yours.

08:15.953 --> 08:18.164
If I have any corrections
on your teaching,

08:18.247 --> 08:19.957
I'll be sure to let you know.

08:30.134 --> 08:32.762
This summer,
I got my second ear piercing.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.223
It was a really hard decision to make

08:35.306 --> 08:38.226
because my mom says
I have such perfect ears already.

08:40.728 --> 08:43.689
That's very exciting, Molly.

08:43.773 --> 08:44.649
Thank you.

08:47.276 --> 08:49.862
Bode, would you like to show the class
how you spent your summer?

08:54.534 --> 08:57.328
This summer, I got super strong.

08:58.663 --> 09:02.291
I spun my brother's car
on top of my finger like a basketball.

09:02.375 --> 09:06.295
He didn't like it much,
but it was worth it just to see his face.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.886
Okay. Thank you, Bode.

09:13.970 --> 09:16.556
Next time, take the assignment
a bit more seriously.

09:16.639 --> 09:19.058
-But I--
-You can take your seat now.

09:19.141 --> 09:20.977
So embarrassing.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.438
Now that was awesome.

09:25.022 --> 09:26.482
Thanks.

09:30.319 --> 09:32.154
So you believe me?

09:32.238 --> 09:35.241
I believe anything's possible.
But how'd you do it?

09:35.324 --> 09:37.702
-I shouldn't say.
-Come on, spill it.

09:40.121 --> 09:41.622
But I barely even know you.

09:41.706 --> 09:45.918
Listen, I'm new here, and you're
the most interesting person I've met.

09:46.002 --> 09:47.169
You can trust me.

09:53.884 --> 09:55.803
Try and take this key from me.

09:55.886 --> 09:57.054
Why?

09:57.138 --> 09:59.140
I just need to make sure of something.

10:03.811 --> 10:06.897
-Did I just pass some sort of test?

10:07.440 --> 10:10.651
Uh, let's just say things got
pretty serious for me last year.

10:11.277 --> 10:13.446
Yeah, last year sucked for me too.

10:13.988 --> 10:15.197
We lost my mom.

10:15.948 --> 10:17.700
I mean, she died.

10:19.910 --> 10:20.828
Really?

10:22.330 --> 10:24.165
My dad did too.

10:25.249 --> 10:26.834
So you know what it's like, then.

10:31.547 --> 10:34.008
So explain how you got
superhuman strength.

10:36.427 --> 10:39.055
What I'm about to tell you
is top secret, understand?

10:44.602 --> 10:47.021
My family
used to live in Seattle.

10:54.028 --> 10:55.071
All right.

10:55.154 --> 10:57.448
Welcome, everybody. I am Mr. Bennett.

10:58.282 --> 10:59.116
I'm new here.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.702
Hey, you're prepared, right?

11:02.244 --> 11:03.079
What?

11:03.162 --> 11:05.623
New teachers love surprise quizzes.
It's a known fact.

11:10.670 --> 11:13.381
-Mind if I sit next to you?
-You can do whatever you want.

11:13.464 --> 11:16.175
Please, just try not to distract me
from my studies.

11:19.387 --> 11:21.931
Now, I know that
we're all gonna be great friends here,

11:22.014 --> 11:24.183
but first,
we have to get through this hurdle.

11:24.266 --> 11:27.228
Told you.
God, I hate being right all the time.

11:27.311 --> 11:28.270
Yes, I'm sorry.

11:28.354 --> 11:32.316
It is a quiz, but it's gonna be super easy
if you did the summer reading.

11:35.736 --> 11:37.738
Shit.

11:39.865 --> 11:40.866
What?

11:41.492 --> 11:43.160
I didn't do the reading.

11:43.786 --> 11:47.039
Um, yeah, you did.

11:47.123 --> 11:50.000
Don't you think I'd remember
reading a 400-something page book?

11:52.670 --> 11:56.257
Jackie, listen, we…
we put the book into your head.

11:57.550 --> 11:58.801
What does that even mean?

11:58.884 --> 12:02.304
It means you know the answers.
Just… Just start reading.

12:02.388 --> 12:06.142
How would I know any of this
if I let you talk me into blowing it off?

12:07.059 --> 12:09.979
Just… Just read the first question.
It'll… It'll come back.

12:10.062 --> 12:13.232
-What's the point?
-Guys. Let's try to have some quiet, okay?

12:15.943 --> 12:16.777
Jackie.

12:18.529 --> 12:20.364
Jackie! Jackie!

12:25.035 --> 12:28.873
I, uh… I didn't do the reading,
so you can just give me a zero.

12:32.418 --> 12:33.252
Okay.

12:39.967 --> 12:41.093
Harvard's gone.

12:55.191 --> 12:56.817
-Wait.

12:56.901 --> 12:58.235
What?

13:08.078 --> 13:09.038
Magic.

13:18.380 --> 13:21.383
You guys saw that, right?

13:21.467 --> 13:24.428
That's honestly the least impressive thing
I've seen her do.

13:27.973 --> 13:29.183
I…

13:29.266 --> 13:31.393
Loss of speech is normal at this stage.

13:32.019 --> 13:32.853
Doug fainted.

13:33.437 --> 13:36.982
All right, while Abby's whole conception
of reality is totally altered,

13:37.066 --> 13:38.484
let's get down to business.

13:38.567 --> 13:40.361
Guys, we had a huge premiere.

13:40.444 --> 13:43.155
I think it's safe to say
we've got a fan base now.

13:43.239 --> 13:46.867
-You mean bigger than just Doug's mom?
-Whoa, hey! Don't knock loyalty!

13:46.951 --> 13:49.578
Linda Brazelle's our OG stan.
You show her some respect.

13:50.204 --> 13:51.038
Just a joke.

13:51.121 --> 13:52.790
Look, we've got some heat.

13:52.873 --> 13:55.209
I say we ride it
and get our sequel off the ground.

13:55.292 --> 13:58.170
The SplatteringCrustacean of Carnage.

13:58.254 --> 13:59.964
Okay, hold on. Hold on.

14:00.047 --> 14:02.299
Can we go back
to the part with the magic keys?

14:02.383 --> 14:04.051
You don't see how the two are connected?

14:04.134 --> 14:07.263
I mean, no offense to Zadie,
but she's not a master at CGI.

14:07.346 --> 14:08.222
We just…

14:08.848 --> 14:10.140
-You know?
-Okay, hold on.

14:10.224 --> 14:12.351
Tom Savini never used CGI,

14:12.434 --> 14:14.645
and he also didn't have access
to a bunch of magic keys.

14:14.728 --> 14:17.439
So what are you saying? You don't wanna
use the keys for the sequel?

14:17.523 --> 14:20.276
No, Doug, I'm saying
let's remember our roots.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.069
Okay, fair enough.

14:22.152 --> 14:24.947
-So, Scot, how's the script coming?

14:25.030 --> 14:27.408
You should probably tell them.

14:28.242 --> 14:29.952
Wait, tell us what?

14:31.245 --> 14:32.329
Um…

14:33.497 --> 14:34.999
Agh!

14:36.125 --> 14:37.501
Uh…

14:38.294 --> 14:41.922
So, as you might know,
I've always dreamt of getting on this

14:42.006 --> 14:47.469
really prestigious and insanely… insanely
selective film program back in the UK.

14:47.553 --> 14:50.639
And as it turns out,
a last-minute spot has opened up.

14:50.723 --> 14:53.350
And it seems to be down to just me
and one other person.

14:54.476 --> 14:56.478
-Wow!
-Hey, that's incredible.

14:56.562 --> 14:57.938
-Congrats, man.
-Thanks.

14:58.022 --> 15:01.483
Wait, when you say last minute,
you mean like you're leaving soon?

15:02.151 --> 15:03.903
Yeah, a couple of weeks.

15:06.530 --> 15:09.533
But I might not be leaving at all.
I might not get in, and I just--

15:09.617 --> 15:11.493
Scot, I am so happy for you.

15:11.577 --> 15:13.996
But so you know,
you're committed to that contract.

15:14.079 --> 15:15.831
You're gonna deliver
the greatest script ever

15:15.915 --> 15:18.500
in exchange for zero dollars
before you get on that plane.

15:18.584 --> 15:21.545
Douglas, my friend,
I promise I will get it done before I go

15:21.629 --> 15:24.590
or before I would have gone
in case they reject me,

15:24.673 --> 15:27.092
which, let's be honest,
they probably will, so…

15:27.176 --> 15:30.554
You're here right now,
so let's just focus on that.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.017
I best get to writing, then.

15:41.065 --> 15:42.316
It's a lot, isn't it?

15:42.816 --> 15:43.692
Yeah.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.903
I can see why you wanted to test me.

15:45.986 --> 15:47.279
I'm not insulted.

15:47.363 --> 15:48.739
Okay, good.

15:49.281 --> 15:51.492
Remember what I said, okay?

15:51.575 --> 15:52.952
This stuff is secret.

15:53.035 --> 15:56.914
The keys and Dodge,
the Black Door, everything.

15:56.997 --> 15:58.540
I'm not gonna tell anybody.

15:58.624 --> 16:00.668
Seriously, who would believe me anyways?

16:02.711 --> 16:03.837
Oh, there's my mom.

16:05.381 --> 16:06.382
Hey, buddy!

16:08.050 --> 16:10.010
-How was your first day?
-Good.

16:10.094 --> 16:11.345
This is Jamie.

16:11.428 --> 16:14.890
-Oh! Hi, Jamie. It's so nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you too.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.475
She just moved here.

16:16.558 --> 16:19.019
-Really? Where'd you move here from?
-Chicago.

16:19.103 --> 16:20.771
Oh, I gotta go. My dad's here.

16:20.854 --> 16:22.523
Is he? I'd love to meet him.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.025
Hi there.

16:25.109 --> 16:27.736
Dad, this is Bode and his mom.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.822
-Yeah, we've--
-Already met.

16:30.614 --> 16:32.616
Oh, cool.

16:32.700 --> 16:34.827
Well, it was really nice
to meet you, Jamie.

16:35.995 --> 16:36.870
And, yeah.

16:38.664 --> 16:39.832
-Bye.
-Bye.

16:49.758 --> 16:51.593
You never told me
Scot might be leaving.

16:51.677 --> 16:53.595
Well, it wasn't my place to say.

16:54.221 --> 16:56.682
Anyway, I knew
he'd tell the whole squad soon, so…

16:56.765 --> 16:59.226
I mean,
he's definitely gonna get in, right?

16:59.768 --> 17:02.021
Who could be better
for that program than him?

17:02.104 --> 17:03.397
Yeah, he's amazing.

17:05.274 --> 17:08.277
But I guess you never really know
what those places are looking for.

17:11.488 --> 17:13.407
Do you not… You don't want him to go?

17:14.199 --> 17:15.200
What?

17:15.284 --> 17:16.577
No, I do.

17:16.660 --> 17:19.204
That school
sounds like an incredible opportunity.

17:19.288 --> 17:21.040
Of course I want him to get in.

17:24.043 --> 17:26.587
Either way,
I think the movie's gonna be fine.

17:26.670 --> 17:29.298
I mean, Scot's talented and all,

17:29.381 --> 17:31.759
but we have
literal movie magic on our side.

17:31.842 --> 17:32.676
True.

17:32.760 --> 17:33.969
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

17:37.306 --> 17:39.725
Hey, speaking of, do you ever think about,

17:39.808 --> 17:42.895
you know, how the keys were made,
where they came from?

17:43.395 --> 17:45.147
I told you my ancestors made them.

17:45.230 --> 17:48.609
I know, but maybe
you inherited some sense of how to do it?

17:49.401 --> 17:51.070
How to make new keys?

17:52.112 --> 17:55.949
How to melt down metal
and somehow infuse it with magical power?

17:56.950 --> 17:58.368
I don't think so. Sorry.

18:00.329 --> 18:02.706
Maybe your dad
mentioned something once, or…

18:02.790 --> 18:04.625
My dad never said a word about the keys.

18:05.125 --> 18:08.587
We didn't know he used them until Bode
became a ghost and talked to Chamberlin.

18:11.507 --> 18:14.635
Gabe, you didn't actually think
I could make new keys, did you?

18:14.718 --> 18:17.054
No. No, I was just curious.

18:17.137 --> 18:19.640
Your family has
this special connection to magic.

18:19.723 --> 18:21.725
I just wanted to know more.

18:23.560 --> 18:25.938
-I'm curious about your family too.

18:26.021 --> 18:28.649
My family, they have a special connection
to being really boring.

18:28.732 --> 18:30.317
-Thanks.

18:31.527 --> 18:33.487
-Are they coming up for Winterfest?
-No.

18:33.570 --> 18:36.865
They're not really the ice sculpture,
sled, and snow maze kind of people.

18:36.949 --> 18:39.326
Mmm. Still, they're your parents.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.956
Not every family can be magic, Kins.

18:57.803 --> 18:59.930
You feel like you know me, right?

19:01.056 --> 19:02.015
Sure.

19:03.267 --> 19:04.393
Wait, it's, um…

19:05.644 --> 19:07.896
Uh, Kinsey, right?

19:07.980 --> 19:09.731
-I'm serious.

19:10.315 --> 19:14.820
I mean, you've been inside my head,
seen all my favorite memories.

19:14.903 --> 19:17.865
I know, and I loved every second of it

19:17.948 --> 19:20.200
except for the One Direction concert.

19:20.701 --> 19:22.077
-Fair.

19:24.997 --> 19:29.293
-But…

19:29.376 --> 19:31.253
I wanna see some of yours.

19:38.510 --> 19:40.262
Wait, you wanna go inside my head?

19:42.639 --> 19:44.975
Uh…

19:45.058 --> 19:47.644
I, uh… I don't know, Kinsey.
That's kind of…

19:47.728 --> 19:50.147
I don't know.
It's probably a mess up there.

19:50.230 --> 19:53.025
I don't care.
Whatever it is is part of you.

19:53.108 --> 19:53.984
Yeah.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.196
Okay, but, uh…

19:58.530 --> 20:01.617
What if you see something embarrassing
and you don't like me anymore?

20:01.700 --> 20:04.411
-What if I don't like myself?
-I don't think that's gonna happen.

20:07.331 --> 20:11.168
Okay. Look, it's nothing personal.
I just don't think I'm ready for that yet.

20:11.251 --> 20:14.463
-How could this not be personal?
-Because it's not about you.

20:14.546 --> 20:18.175
-Gabe, I promise I would never judge you--
-No! No! Just drop it.

20:22.721 --> 20:23.555
Sure.

20:25.807 --> 20:29.728
Kinsey, look, I'm sorry. I just…
I do want you to know me.

20:30.812 --> 20:34.233
Just ask me anything, and I'll answer it.
Anything, I swear.

20:37.194 --> 20:38.528
I think you should go.

21:05.931 --> 21:08.308
Hey, Jack, I've…
I've been trying to call you.

21:09.309 --> 21:10.852
Yeah, I've been busy.

21:10.936 --> 21:12.771
Yeah, I see that. What are you, um…

21:16.858 --> 21:17.859
Memory loss.

21:18.610 --> 21:23.407
Yesterday in class, I couldn't,
for the life of me, remember what we did,

21:23.490 --> 21:25.909
that we used the Head Key
to put that book into my head.

21:26.535 --> 21:28.453
You were trying to explain everything,

21:28.537 --> 21:32.833
but in the moment, it was like
you were just saying nonsense words.

21:33.458 --> 21:35.085
And I was totally confused.

21:35.168 --> 21:39.298
And then last week,
with the movie and the bonfire…

21:40.090 --> 21:41.341
But you remember now?

21:42.509 --> 21:43.343
All of it.

21:43.844 --> 21:44.928
Every bit.

21:46.054 --> 21:49.349
But what's happening to me?
I'm forgetting major parts of my own life.

21:49.433 --> 21:51.476
You know how
grown-ups can't remember magic?

21:53.270 --> 21:54.271
Yeah.

21:55.856 --> 21:58.191
I think we're starting to see
how that begins.

21:59.568 --> 22:01.153
You're about to turn 18.

22:04.072 --> 22:05.824
Eighteen, but that's just…

22:07.409 --> 22:08.910
barely not a kid.

22:08.994 --> 22:09.953
I know, I…

22:11.496 --> 22:12.998
I thought we'd have more time.

22:15.584 --> 22:16.626
So,

22:17.919 --> 22:19.463
the keys and…

22:21.423 --> 22:23.967
everything we've ever done
together with them?

22:26.219 --> 22:27.679
It's just gonna be gone?

22:30.766 --> 22:32.434
Like it never even happened?

22:42.527 --> 22:44.321
And there's nothing we can do?

22:51.870 --> 22:54.498
Hey, Jackie, it's, uh… it's me.
It's Tyler.

22:54.581 --> 22:57.918
It's… It's you. Say hi to yourself.

22:58.001 --> 22:59.044
Hello.

22:59.127 --> 23:02.756
Um, we are recording this to remind you

23:02.839 --> 23:06.468
of all the times
that we've used magical keys together. Um…

23:07.427 --> 23:11.640
So one of the very first times
was when I used the Head Key

23:11.723 --> 23:14.559
to put books about England into my head

23:14.643 --> 23:17.270
because I knew that you loved England,

23:17.354 --> 23:19.356
and I was trying to impress you.

23:19.439 --> 23:21.358
It-- It was not a success.

23:21.441 --> 23:23.026
No, but then later,

23:23.110 --> 23:26.071
I got to see a memory of the first time
your dad took you fishing,

23:26.738 --> 23:29.825
and you caught a fish about this big.

23:30.534 --> 23:31.743
I was four.

23:31.827 --> 23:33.245
It was very sweet.

23:38.875 --> 23:39.751
Hey.

23:40.836 --> 23:42.087
Hey. Hey.

23:42.587 --> 23:46.174
I was just going to the library
to get started on the script.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.427
I'm sure it's gonna be
even more epic than the first.

23:48.510 --> 23:52.514
Yeah. Well, I hope so. I actually don't
wanna let the Savinis down, you know?

23:52.597 --> 23:54.474
You're really tough on yourself.

23:54.558 --> 23:56.184
You can thank my parents for that.

23:56.268 --> 23:59.521
There wasn't room for failure
in the Cavendish household.

23:59.604 --> 24:02.023
They must be excited
about you maybe moving back.

24:02.524 --> 24:06.319
Yeah. I, uh, may have not told them
I've actually applied yet.

24:06.403 --> 24:07.904
Well, they just…

24:07.988 --> 24:11.992
They think that filmmaking is a hobby.
They want me to be a barrister.

24:12.617 --> 24:13.743
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

24:13.827 --> 24:16.329
I'm just trying to picture you
in that wig.

24:16.413 --> 24:20.333
I know. It's ridiculous,
but it is the track they put me on.

24:22.169 --> 24:24.838
It was their idea for me
to come to school in America.

24:24.921 --> 24:27.799
Said it would give me
a more well-rounded résumé.

24:27.883 --> 24:29.509
I will thank them for that.

24:30.051 --> 24:32.137
Otherwise, we never would have met.

24:37.434 --> 24:39.352
I know you're gonna get in.

24:39.436 --> 24:41.062
Shh!

24:41.146 --> 24:43.982
Don't… Don't go jinxing it,
all right?

24:44.983 --> 24:45.901
Hey, guys.

24:46.693 --> 24:47.694
Hey, bud.

24:48.445 --> 24:49.404
What's up?

24:51.615 --> 24:52.741
Uh…

24:52.824 --> 24:56.286
I should get going.
Uh, I'll catch you guys later.

24:56.369 --> 24:59.122
Preproduction starts this weekend. Whoo!

25:03.960 --> 25:06.213
Hey, wait.
Do you wanna hang out after school?

25:06.296 --> 25:08.131
It's my day to visit Erin Voss.

25:09.883 --> 25:12.219
Mmm. Trouble in paradise?

25:14.179 --> 25:15.972
-Shut up, Eden.

25:17.724 --> 25:20.227
-She doesn't know how to make keys.
-Ugh.

25:20.810 --> 25:22.103
That's too bad.

25:22.729 --> 25:24.648
Well, silver lining, we can kill her now.

25:24.731 --> 25:25.732
No!

25:26.816 --> 25:27.984
Chill.

25:29.945 --> 25:32.322
All right, so we can't use her.

25:33.073 --> 25:34.407
How are we gonna make this key?

25:37.953 --> 25:41.706
I can't tell you how excited I am
that this renovation is finally happening.

25:41.790 --> 25:45.752
Well, it's incredibly generous of you
to be financing the whole thing, Mr. Shaw.

25:45.835 --> 25:47.045
Gordie, please.

25:47.128 --> 25:49.923
I have so many fond memories
of my time in that theater.

25:50.006 --> 25:52.968
I was Jud in Oklahoma! my freshman year.

25:53.051 --> 25:55.303
-That was an adventure.
-I bet.

25:55.804 --> 25:58.515
And then I was in
a memorable production of The Tempest

25:58.598 --> 26:01.017
as an understudy
for a certain Rendell Locke.

26:02.519 --> 26:03.728
Wow, really?

26:03.812 --> 26:08.066
I think he may have tried out as a joke,
so it stung a little when he got the part.

26:08.650 --> 26:11.444
But I have to admit,
he nailed that act 5 soliloquy.

26:11.528 --> 26:13.822
Anyway, I'll check in next week.

26:13.905 --> 26:15.282
I'm bursting with excitement.

26:15.365 --> 26:16.241
Same.

26:16.741 --> 26:17.784
Thanks, Gordie.

26:21.913 --> 26:25.250
I was just about
to, uh, drop this by the theater for you.

26:25.333 --> 26:28.253
Oh, thank you.
You, uh, didn't have to do that.

26:29.129 --> 26:30.046
Oh, I did.

26:30.130 --> 26:33.008
I, uh… I went digging around
in the school archives,

26:33.091 --> 26:35.552
and I found a bunch of stuff
on the old theater.

26:35.635 --> 26:36.469
Uh-huh.

26:36.553 --> 26:39.014
Including some
of the original architectural drawings.

26:39.097 --> 26:40.849
I photocopied those for you.

26:44.603 --> 26:45.520
Wow.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.566
Oh, these are…

26:51.526 --> 26:53.111
incredibly helpful.

26:53.903 --> 26:55.447
-Thank you.
-Yeah, sure.

26:55.530 --> 26:57.449
I found a bunch of old photos too

26:57.532 --> 27:00.702
from 1878,
the year after the theater was built,

27:01.870 --> 27:03.413
and wouldn't you know it?

27:05.707 --> 27:06.583
Carpet.

27:07.125 --> 27:09.586
There's carpet all over that damn place.

27:09.669 --> 27:11.296
So there you have it.

27:11.379 --> 27:13.965
Proof that I'm an actual jackass.

27:17.177 --> 27:19.220
We just moved here from Chicago.

27:19.304 --> 27:22.891
I've been teaching
at the same magnet school for 15 years.

27:22.974 --> 27:25.935
Oh, so this is a major change for you?

27:26.019 --> 27:28.980
Yeah, we've been through
some pretty big upheavals.

27:30.315 --> 27:33.318
My, uh-- Jamie's mom
passed away last year.

27:33.943 --> 27:36.529
Oh. I'm so sorry to hear that.

27:36.613 --> 27:37.572
Thank you.

27:38.281 --> 27:40.992
We're gettin' through it,
but, um, Jamie and I felt

27:41.076 --> 27:45.330
that Chicago had become more of
a depressing slideshow than a home.

27:46.122 --> 27:47.457
I… I get that.

27:51.878 --> 27:53.797
I lost my husband last year too.

27:58.051 --> 27:59.052
You heard.

27:59.886 --> 28:01.096
Of course you heard.

28:01.596 --> 28:03.056
Someone mentioned,

28:04.224 --> 28:05.767
which added to the general feeling

28:05.850 --> 28:08.436
that I was a jerk
of historical proportions the other day.

28:08.520 --> 28:12.107
My wife would not even have recognized
that mansplaining idiot

28:12.190 --> 28:14.192
who tried to tell you how to do your job.

28:14.275 --> 28:16.528
-I apologize.
-No, it's okay. Forget it.

28:17.654 --> 28:21.032
I don't even like to think about
all the stupid things I said…

28:21.616 --> 28:25.870
…said and did
in the year after my husband died.

28:28.373 --> 28:29.708
So why Matheson?

28:31.042 --> 28:34.045
Well, I have always wanted to live
in this part of New England.

28:36.172 --> 28:37.173
-You have?
-Yeah.

28:37.257 --> 28:40.677
The precolonial history of Matheson alone,
it's some of the most fascinating…

28:40.760 --> 28:42.303
You know what?

28:43.012 --> 28:46.641
I'm just gonna stop it right there.
Let's start all of this again.

28:48.935 --> 28:53.314
Hi, I know that we have never spoken
a single word to each other,

28:53.398 --> 28:55.525
but I just wanted to introduce myself.

28:55.608 --> 28:57.360
-Josh Bennett.
-Nina Locke.

28:57.986 --> 28:59.779
-Okay.

28:59.863 --> 29:00.864
This is me.

29:02.866 --> 29:04.325
You… You live in the dorm?

29:04.409 --> 29:06.453
Yeah, I get a cozy, rent-free apartment

29:06.536 --> 29:09.831
in exchange
for supervising 30 hormonal teens.

29:10.707 --> 29:12.292
And that's a good deal?

29:12.375 --> 29:13.626
Jury's still out.

29:15.128 --> 29:18.047
Well, I'm… I'm gonna head back
to the theater now.

29:18.131 --> 29:22.302
Maybe we could, uh, set up a playdate
for the kids sometime?

29:23.219 --> 29:25.889
-I'm really glad Bode's made a new friend.
-Same here.

29:26.556 --> 29:27.474
For Jamie.

29:29.517 --> 29:30.477
Anytime, yes.

29:30.560 --> 29:31.895
Okay.

30:12.477 --> 30:14.729
Hey, I got your text. You okay?

30:15.313 --> 30:17.315
Jackie's getting lost again.

30:18.358 --> 30:19.984
Shit, I'm sorry.

30:20.068 --> 30:22.278
In a couple months, it's gonna be me.

30:25.907 --> 30:28.159
What if something really bad
happens again? I…

30:29.327 --> 30:30.745
I won't be able to help you.

30:31.830 --> 30:34.165
It'll just be you and Bode.

30:34.249 --> 30:37.085
And then, in a few years,
it's just gonna be Bode

30:37.627 --> 30:38.628
on his own.

30:42.799 --> 30:45.009
There has to be some way around this.

31:02.277 --> 31:03.653
Oh, hey, bud.

31:03.736 --> 31:06.072
I'm supposed to meet Kinsey.
We have a study date.

31:06.573 --> 31:07.740
She's at the hospital.

31:07.824 --> 31:10.410
She goes there every week
to visit Erin Voss.

31:10.910 --> 31:13.955
Right. Uh, you know,
I must have gotten our days mixed up.

31:14.038 --> 31:15.206
It kinda sucks.

31:15.290 --> 31:18.585
I brought her favorite.
Dr Pepper and a bunch of Twizzlers.

31:22.297 --> 31:23.715
Uh, can I have one?

31:25.550 --> 31:28.052
Mmm.

31:28.136 --> 31:29.846
So, you here all by yourself?

31:30.430 --> 31:33.641
Yeah, my mom went to your school
to do some work,

31:33.725 --> 31:36.519
and my Uncle Duncan
went to Boston for the day.

31:36.603 --> 31:37.812
So what are you doing?

31:37.896 --> 31:39.981
Mmm, just some homework.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.066
Bode.

31:42.901 --> 31:45.820
Don't you realize
now's your chance to live your best life?

31:46.779 --> 31:48.197
What do you mean?

31:48.281 --> 31:50.074
Well, you've got all this power,

31:50.158 --> 31:52.327
and you get to do
whatever you want with it.

31:54.245 --> 31:55.663
So why don't we live a little?

32:51.177 --> 32:54.180
That was great, but I don't think Kinsey's
gonna show. I should head back.

32:54.263 --> 32:56.849
But there's so much more stuff
that we could smash.

32:56.933 --> 33:00.520
-I'm kind of smashed out, man.
-We can play with the other keys, then.

33:02.981 --> 33:06.192
Well, I mean, there is one key
I've kind of always wanted to try.

33:06.818 --> 33:07.902
Which one?

33:07.986 --> 33:09.028
The Ghost Key.

33:09.696 --> 33:10.947
I'll be back.

33:23.126 --> 33:25.086
Maybe I'm being too hard on Gabe.

33:25.670 --> 33:28.006
His parents' divorce probably wrecked him.

33:29.424 --> 33:32.927
Maybe they made him feel like
it's not okay to let people in, you know.

33:39.726 --> 33:41.102
Scot's head was a mess.

33:45.356 --> 33:46.315
I loved it.

33:49.110 --> 33:51.696
-I brought you some water.
-Thanks.

33:53.281 --> 33:56.534
You are so sweet
to come and visit Erin every week.

33:57.410 --> 34:01.372
-She doesn't get a lot of visitors.
-She was a good friend of my dad's.

34:07.670 --> 34:09.756
I just think I'm afraid of losing people.

34:10.339 --> 34:13.134
I see what Tyler's going through
with Jackie.

34:13.217 --> 34:15.470
She's starting to age out of magic.

34:17.096 --> 34:18.931
We're all gonna lose each other.

34:20.683 --> 34:22.143
We have to find a way.

34:29.734 --> 34:32.153
We thought after you become an adult,
you forget.

34:33.446 --> 34:35.239
We found a way to remember.

34:45.875 --> 34:47.126
-Hey.
-Hey.

34:47.210 --> 34:50.463
-Can you come meet me at the hospital?
-Yeah, why? What's going on?

34:50.546 --> 34:52.256
Just get over here.

34:53.424 --> 34:54.550
I've got an idea.

34:59.388 --> 35:02.266
Get ready. This is gonna blow your mind.

35:02.350 --> 35:05.812
-Oh, don't build it up too much.
-Impossible.

35:05.895 --> 35:07.230
Are you sure I…

35:07.313 --> 35:08.606
I can use it anytime.

35:08.689 --> 35:12.693
Plus, if my mom comes home and sees
both of our dead bodies on the floor,

35:12.777 --> 35:13.820
she'd go nuts.

35:16.364 --> 35:17.323
Take it.

35:26.165 --> 35:28.751
Okay, but don't draw on my face
with Sharpie or something.

35:28.835 --> 35:32.713
Wow, I can't believe
I've never thought of that before.

35:33.673 --> 35:35.591
But I won't. I promise.

35:56.279 --> 35:57.446
Here goes nothing.

36:08.124 --> 36:10.585
Pretty cool, huh? Have a good time!

36:11.836 --> 36:13.421
I will, you little shit.

36:25.850 --> 36:26.893
Excuse me!

36:31.397 --> 36:32.940
Are you Chamberlin Locke?

36:33.024 --> 36:33.983
Yes.

36:34.483 --> 36:35.651
Hi, I'm Gabe.

36:35.735 --> 36:37.987
I'm dating your descendant, Kinsey.

36:38.070 --> 36:39.322
Oh, Kinsey.

36:40.573 --> 36:41.824
Did she fly out with you?

36:42.408 --> 36:43.451
No, it's…

36:45.828 --> 36:48.331
it's a bit of a secret that I'm here.

36:48.915 --> 36:51.918
See, I really care about her.
I wanna get her a gift.

36:52.835 --> 36:54.587
I wanna make her a new magical key.

36:55.171 --> 36:57.089
That is not an easy task.

36:57.173 --> 37:00.343
The very material
is extremely hard to come by.

37:00.426 --> 37:01.552
That's the thing.

37:01.636 --> 37:04.889
I think I stumbled upon a piece of it
down in the caves.

37:04.972 --> 37:06.474
In the caves?

37:07.475 --> 37:10.561
It's never been wise
to venture down there.

37:10.645 --> 37:11.562
I know,

37:12.438 --> 37:14.482
but I would risk anything for her.

37:16.275 --> 37:18.486
So, you're in love.

37:19.820 --> 37:22.031
What sort of key do you have in mind?

37:22.823 --> 37:24.575
I have a few ideas.

37:26.244 --> 37:28.788
But that's actually
what I wanted to ask you.

37:29.372 --> 37:31.666
How do I give a key its purpose?

37:31.749 --> 37:34.835
How do I make sure it does what I intend?

37:34.919 --> 37:36.796
Why, through exactly that.

37:36.879 --> 37:37.838
Intention.

37:38.422 --> 37:42.802
As one is smithing the key,
one needs to focus your whole mind,

37:42.885 --> 37:46.847
visualizing precisely
what you want the key to do.

37:47.473 --> 37:49.433
But the most important thing is

37:50.101 --> 37:53.813
you must add a drop
of your own fresh-cut blood.

37:54.438 --> 37:55.564
If you do that,

37:56.315 --> 38:01.654
you will have a key that will show Kinsey
what is truly in your heart.

38:03.406 --> 38:05.574
I'm very grateful to you, sir. Thank you.

38:12.707 --> 38:13.874
I wish you luck, young man.

38:20.798 --> 38:22.466
-How was it?
-Super fun! Thanks.

38:22.550 --> 38:25.886
-Did you try and fly through walls?
-Sorry, can't talk. I gotta go.

38:28.264 --> 38:29.890
-Okay.

38:30.516 --> 38:31.809
-Bye!

38:31.892 --> 38:34.520
Remember when we asked Ellie
how she could remember magic

38:34.603 --> 38:36.063
even though she was a grown-up?

38:36.147 --> 38:38.399
She said they found a way to remember.

38:39.358 --> 38:40.192
"They,"

38:40.276 --> 38:41.986
the Keepers of the Keys.

38:43.738 --> 38:46.032
-Erin's the only Keeper left.
-Yeah.

38:46.115 --> 38:47.450
If we go inside her head,

38:47.533 --> 38:50.536
maybe we can find a memory
of what Ellie was talking about,

38:50.619 --> 38:51.787
how they remember.

38:52.288 --> 38:54.457
Then we can make it
so that we never forget.

39:03.299 --> 39:05.468
We're not gonna look at anything
we're not supposed to.

39:05.551 --> 39:07.178
We're not gonna touch anything.

39:07.720 --> 39:10.181
We don't wanna
make her worse than she already is.

39:35.081 --> 39:36.874
Why… Why isn't there a second Erin?

39:38.084 --> 39:39.794
I don't know. It's weird.

39:42.505 --> 39:44.465
It's possible there's nothing in there.

39:46.008 --> 39:47.385
We have to try anyway.

41:02.418 --> 41:04.753
Hey, Kins, come look at this.

41:13.971 --> 41:17.683
Wow, she never really moved on from Dad.

41:18.225 --> 41:19.518
It makes sense.

41:19.602 --> 41:22.271
She's been in a catatonic state
since she was our age.

41:23.898 --> 41:25.149
Let's keep looking.

41:55.638 --> 41:56.847
Tyler!

42:01.769 --> 42:03.103
There!

42:08.025 --> 42:09.985
How do we get out
of here?

42:10.069 --> 42:11.195
I feel something!

42:25.042 --> 42:26.544
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

42:35.261 --> 42:36.262
Hello?

42:43.769 --> 42:45.437
Tell her to leave me alone!

42:45.521 --> 42:46.981
-Who?
-Dodge!

42:48.399 --> 42:49.400
Dodge is gone.

42:50.484 --> 42:52.194
-I'm Kinsey.
-Oh! Okay.

42:52.778 --> 42:53.946
And this is Tyler.

42:56.907 --> 42:57.950
Who are you?

42:59.243 --> 43:00.911
We're… We're Rendell's kids.

43:05.207 --> 43:06.250
You're what?

43:07.334 --> 43:08.294
Erin,

43:09.378 --> 43:11.338
have you been in here this whole time?

43:13.424 --> 43:15.634
What do you mean "this whole time"?

43:17.261 --> 43:18.846
Have you been trapped in here?

43:22.016 --> 43:24.101
How do you know that Dodge is gone?

43:24.184 --> 43:26.186
Because we sent her back
where she came from,

43:26.770 --> 43:29.106
into whatever is behind the Black Door.

43:30.608 --> 43:31.567
You're safe now.

43:32.776 --> 43:33.736
I promise.

43:35.738 --> 43:38.532
Just, um… Just come with us.

43:39.033 --> 43:41.201
We'll get you out of here, okay?

43:42.911 --> 43:44.330
-Okay.

44:01.347 --> 44:03.682
What is this place? Where are we?

44:04.433 --> 44:05.768
We're in the hospital.

44:14.818 --> 44:15.861
That's, uh…

44:17.404 --> 44:18.322
That's you.

44:32.461 --> 44:33.671
Do you want us to…

44:33.754 --> 44:34.797
No.

44:36.882 --> 44:37.841
I'll do it.
