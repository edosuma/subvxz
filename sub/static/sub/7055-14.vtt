00:00.362 --> 00:02.033
His name is
David Robert Jones.

00:02.035 --> 00:03.102
He's a scientist.

00:03.169 --> 00:04.236
Previously on <i>Fringe...</i>

00:04.304 --> 00:06.038
I've never met you
in my life.

00:06.106 --> 00:07.339
But I've met you.

00:07.407 --> 00:09.028
You created a portal.

00:09.095 --> 00:10.740
I'm the man
who closed it on you.

00:10.808 --> 00:12.242
Interesting story.

00:12.309 --> 00:14.886
Yet I'm still
in one piece.

00:14.954 --> 00:16.453
I need you to take me
to the bridge.

00:16.521 --> 00:17.884
I need to see Nina Sharp.

00:17.952 --> 00:20.184
Olivia has Cortexiphan
in her system.

00:20.251 --> 00:21.350
I did a chemical analysis.

00:21.418 --> 00:23.015
The results
are irrefutable.

00:23.083 --> 00:24.755
<i>20 vials present</i>
<i>and accounted for.</i>

00:24.823 --> 00:26.687
This is not Cortexiphan.

00:26.754 --> 00:28.856
The Cortexiphan
has been replaced.

00:28.924 --> 00:30.389
I know what you're doing.

00:30.457 --> 00:33.090
I know what it's like to want
something back that you love.

00:33.158 --> 00:35.356
Whatever's happening to Olivia,
I'm not doing it.

00:35.424 --> 00:37.558
<i>I think you are.</i>
<i>Even without meaning to.</i>

00:37.626 --> 00:38.695
It's wrong, Peter.

00:38.763 --> 00:40.897
The, uh, girl came in here
a couple minutes ago,

00:40.965 --> 00:42.166
about yea tall, blond?

00:42.234 --> 00:44.804
I'm sorry.
I didn't see her.

00:47.674 --> 00:49.643
Broyles has agents and B.P.D.
combing the area,

00:49.711 --> 00:51.778
checking
all the traffic cams.

00:51.846 --> 00:54.047
Nina has to be behind
Olivia's disappearance.

00:54.115 --> 00:55.583
Once she's been processed in
at the FBI,

00:55.651 --> 00:56.952
we'll get her talking.

00:57.019 --> 00:58.886
I thought you said she's denying
any involvement in this.

00:58.954 --> 00:59.887
For now.

00:59.954 --> 01:01.321
Her alibi
is not gonna hold.

01:01.389 --> 01:02.623
And if she knows
where Olivia is--

01:02.690 --> 01:04.989
Good luck getting Nina Sharp
to break down and tell us.

01:05.058 --> 01:06.525
All right,
point taken.

01:06.593 --> 01:08.826
You still haven't told me
what you're hoping to find here.

01:08.894 --> 01:11.295
If Walter's right and Olivia
is being dosed with Cortexiphan,

01:11.363 --> 01:13.964
it stands to reason that she was
gotten to when she was alone

01:14.031 --> 01:14.964
and vulnerable.

01:15.032 --> 01:17.966
You think
she was being watched?

01:18.034 --> 01:20.903
And this Cortexiphan
is the reason

01:20.970 --> 01:22.038
she's been acting
strangely.

01:22.105 --> 01:23.473
That's
Walter's theory.

01:23.540 --> 01:25.141
Right, he thinks
that you've been somehow

01:25.209 --> 01:26.543
projecting your Olivia
onto her,

01:26.611 --> 01:28.612
<i>that she's assuming</i>
<i>the memories and personality</i>

01:28.680 --> 01:30.347
<i>of the Olivia</i>
<i>from your timeline.</i>

01:30.415 --> 01:31.850
Is any of this relevant
right now?

01:31.918 --> 01:34.186
It is to me.
She's my partner.

01:34.254 --> 01:35.320
And if that's true,

01:35.388 --> 01:37.189
<i>think about what</i>
<i>you're doing to her.</i>

01:37.257 --> 01:39.960
Unintentionally or not, you are
robbing her of her identity,

01:40.027 --> 01:41.695
her life.

01:41.763 --> 01:45.199
She is not
your Olivia, Peter.

01:45.267 --> 01:48.537
And what if she is?

01:48.604 --> 01:50.172
You know
that's impossible.

01:50.240 --> 01:53.208
Yet you still let her
continue working the case,

01:53.276 --> 01:54.811
knowing that she
was under your influence,

01:54.878 --> 01:56.246
that she wasn't herself.

01:56.313 --> 01:58.148
I don't know you that well,
but I'd like to think

01:58.215 --> 02:01.084
you weren't ignoring her safety
for personal reasons...

02:01.151 --> 02:04.221
And that you're not
ignoring me right now.

02:04.289 --> 02:05.990
I'm not ignoring you.

02:07.000 --> 02:13.074

<i>Wireless closed circuit.</i>

02:17.171 --> 02:21.041
It could have transmitted
anywhere.

02:21.108 --> 02:22.042
What's that?

02:22.109 --> 02:23.877
It's a backup
memory disk.

02:23.944 --> 02:25.445
I've seen surveillance cameras
like that before.

02:25.513 --> 02:27.146
They continually capture
and store images

02:27.214 --> 02:29.315
on a disk like this
in a 60-minute loop.

02:29.383 --> 02:31.684
Olivia hasn't been here
all day.

02:31.751 --> 02:33.886
I doubt it's recorded anything
useful in the last hour.

02:33.953 --> 02:35.487
I can have our techs
take a look.

02:35.555 --> 02:38.456
They're not gonna find anything,
but maybe Walter and I will.

02:38.524 --> 02:40.125
Let Broyles know
that we're working on this.

02:40.193 --> 02:42.060
In the meantime, you should
keep on working on Nina,

02:42.128 --> 02:43.663
'cause if this
doesn't pan out,

02:43.730 --> 02:44.992
<i>you're gonna have to do</i>
<i>the impossible.</i>

02:45.017 --> 02:46.232
What's that?

02:46.414 --> 02:48.616
Get her talking.

02:48.803 --> 02:52.206
Well, they came for me
in the middle of the night,

02:52.273 --> 02:53.540
when I was asleep.

02:53.608 --> 02:55.109
They grabbed me.

02:55.177 --> 02:57.278
Before they put the bag
over my head,

02:57.346 --> 03:00.147
I saw her stepping out
of the shadows behind them.

03:00.215 --> 03:01.815
It was me, Olive.

03:01.883 --> 03:03.984
I mean, she looked
exactly like me.

03:04.052 --> 03:06.854
So it wasn't you that I saw
in your office a few weeks ago?

03:06.922 --> 03:09.723
You didn't come to my apartment
to help me when I was sick?

03:09.791 --> 03:13.326
No, I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I wish I could say that it was.

03:13.631 --> 03:15.398
I've been so worried
about you.

03:15.466 --> 03:17.267
You know, all the time
they've held me here,

03:17.334 --> 03:19.402
he still hasn't told me
what he's after.

03:22.306 --> 03:23.807
<i>Olivia Dunham.</i>

03:23.875 --> 03:28.379
I've waited so very long
to meet you.

03:28.447 --> 03:30.948
Actually,
we've already met.

03:32.818 --> 03:36.021
You have me at a bit
of a disadvantage.

03:36.089 --> 03:37.789
I watched you die.

03:37.857 --> 03:39.858
And I'm looking forward
to seeing you do that again.

03:39.926 --> 03:43.329
Maybe confusion's
an unforeseen side effect.

03:43.397 --> 03:45.698
I'm a bit confused
myself.

03:45.766 --> 03:49.402
She's not the first
to say that to me.

03:49.470 --> 03:51.104
A side effect
from what?

03:51.172 --> 03:52.405
What does he mean?

03:52.473 --> 03:55.075
Well, of course,
you don't know,

03:55.143 --> 03:56.643
though I imagine
you've been feeling

03:56.711 --> 03:58.211
the effects
for some time--

03:58.279 --> 04:00.413
your migraines,
for example.

04:00.481 --> 04:02.949
What the hell
did you do to me?

04:03.017 --> 04:05.384
Nothing...

04:05.452 --> 04:08.321
That wasn't already done
to you a long time ago.

04:08.388 --> 04:11.089
<i>But then...</i>

04:11.157 --> 04:12.791
<i>You were just a child.</i>

04:14.460 --> 04:16.494
Dr. Bishop's notes
from the Cortexiphan trial

04:16.562 --> 04:17.962
<i>were quite clear.</i>

04:18.029 --> 04:21.266
The subjects' abilities
were triggered

04:21.334 --> 04:25.137
by sparks
of intense emotions, hmm?

04:25.205 --> 04:27.373
Let's prime that.

04:29.343 --> 04:33.914
Every journey begins
with a first step.

04:36.017 --> 04:38.618
Jones,
you leave her alone.

04:38.686 --> 04:42.155
Always the protective
mother hen.

04:45.759 --> 04:46.926
What are you doing?

04:57.102 --> 04:58.036
Don't.

05:00.373 --> 05:01.707
No.

05:04.778 --> 05:06.646
Nina.

05:06.714 --> 05:09.550
<i>Damn it, Jones.</i>
<i>Stop!</i>

05:09.617 --> 05:12.987
Yes, I believe
this will work nicely.

No.

Do we know why he failed
to carry out his instructions,

05:57.687 --> 05:59.521
why he did not erase
the lingering traces

05:59.589 --> 06:01.223
of Peter Bishop
from this timeline?

September

06:11.000 --> 06:13.968
on behalf of this boy,

06:14.036 --> 06:17.039
He has been given

How should we proceed?

06:19.909 --> 06:22.310
We wait.

06:22.378 --> 06:24.646

Have they found her yet?

06:41.030 --> 06:43.865
Sit down,
Nina.

06:43.933 --> 06:46.301
Now, Phillip,
tell me.

06:46.369 --> 06:48.370
Do you have any idea
if she's all right?

06:48.438 --> 06:50.605
Do you?

06:50.673 --> 06:53.475
How can you
ask me that?

06:53.542 --> 06:57.245
I raised Olivia
as if she was my own daughter.

06:58.847 --> 07:01.281
Sit down.

07:11.558 --> 07:12.958
Phillip,
you know me.

07:13.026 --> 07:15.460
Do you honestly believe

07:15.528 --> 07:18.430
that I've been dosing Olivia
with Cortexiphan,

07:18.498 --> 07:22.067
that I could have had anything
to do with her disappearance?

07:23.870 --> 07:27.872
I want to
believe you, Nina.

07:27.940 --> 07:30.941
If you care about Olivia
as you say,

07:31.009 --> 07:32.242
then cooperate.

07:32.310 --> 07:34.545
The more you tell me,
the sooner I can find her,

07:34.612 --> 07:35.745
and the better
it'll be for you.

07:35.813 --> 07:36.880
For God's sake, Phillip,

07:36.947 --> 07:40.816
I have already told you
everything that I know.

07:40.884 --> 07:43.652
I should be coordinating
with Massive Dynamic resources

07:43.720 --> 07:45.387
to assist
in the search,

07:45.455 --> 07:47.890
not sitting here
in some damn cell.

08:00.173 --> 08:01.940
When were you last

08:02.008 --> 08:04.310
in the Massive Dynamic
deep-containment facility?

08:04.377 --> 08:06.345
Yesterday afternoon
with Agent Lee.

08:06.413 --> 08:07.713
And before that?

08:07.781 --> 08:11.017
I've told you already.
I haven't been there for years.

08:11.085 --> 08:13.553
The biometric logs
show you accessed

08:13.620 --> 08:16.823
the storage facility twice
within the last three months.

08:21.862 --> 08:23.128
Well, that's not true.

08:23.196 --> 08:25.030
The logs
have been tampered with.

08:25.098 --> 08:30.002
There are eyewitnesses who say
they saw you enter the facility.

08:30.069 --> 08:31.336
We have
signed affidavits

08:31.404 --> 08:34.206
from your own
security people.

08:36.342 --> 08:38.211
A-a shapeshifter.
I-it had to have been.

08:38.278 --> 08:40.580
That's the only explanation.

08:40.648 --> 08:43.582
If a shapeshifter was
responsible, then you'd be dead.

08:46.053 --> 08:48.521
What are you doing
with Olivia?

08:54.160 --> 08:56.595
I see where
this is headed.

08:56.662 --> 08:59.564
You've convicted me
already.

08:59.632 --> 09:03.033
I'm not saying another word
without my attorney present.

09:07.439 --> 09:09.039
Have it your way.

09:26.826 --> 09:29.260
<i>What exactly</i>
<i>are you hoping to find</i>

09:29.328 --> 09:31.329
on this chip
that you haven't viewed already?

09:31.396 --> 09:34.565
The camera records over itself
every 60 minutes,

09:34.633 --> 09:36.433
<i>burying the older images</i>
<i>under new footage,</i>

09:36.501 --> 09:38.602
<i>so I'm hoping that this machine</i>
<i>is gonna give us a chance</i>

09:38.670 --> 09:39.903
to reproduce
those older images.

09:39.971 --> 09:41.938
A very slim chance.

09:42.006 --> 09:44.106
Thanks for
the encouragement, Walter.

09:44.174 --> 09:46.209
I should never have let her
out of the lab.

09:46.276 --> 09:48.678
- You shouldn't have.
- What?

09:48.746 --> 09:53.283
I warned you not to succumb
to temptation, Peter.

09:53.351 --> 09:56.053
Whatever consciousness Olivia
appears to be manifesting now,

09:56.121 --> 09:58.623
she is not who you think she is.
- You don't know that.

09:58.690 --> 10:00.658
What I do know

10:00.726 --> 10:03.829
is that if I had kept her here,
as I should have,

10:03.896 --> 10:05.598
then she wouldn't
have been taken.

10:05.665 --> 10:08.567
<i>And we wouldn't be fishing</i>
<i>in the dark,</i>

10:08.635 --> 10:10.102
hinging our hopes
on pulling

10:10.169 --> 10:13.571
a palimpsest out
of that chip.

10:13.639 --> 10:15.239
Right now the only thing
that matters is finding Olivia.

10:15.307 --> 10:16.874
Everything else
will work itself out.

10:16.942 --> 10:19.443
Uh, I'm sorry, but what--
what is a "palimpsest"?

10:19.510 --> 10:22.913
A manuscript page
from a scroll or book

10:22.980 --> 10:27.049
from which the text
has been scraped off,

10:27.117 --> 10:29.151
which means
it can be used again.

10:29.219 --> 10:32.488
Like when you rerecord
over an old VHS or cassette.

10:32.556 --> 10:33.556
Precisely.

10:33.624 --> 10:36.560
And what was underneath
bleeds through--

10:36.628 --> 10:39.797
Hold on.
I'm getting something.

10:44.270 --> 10:47.973
- I need to increase the magnetic contrast.
- Increase the magnetic contrast.

10:48.040 --> 10:48.974
Thank you.

10:53.258 --> 10:54.859
<i>Olivia.</i>

10:54.927 --> 10:57.160
Great.
Now what?

10:57.161 --> 10:58.724
Now we dig deeper,

10:58.726 --> 11:00.485
see if we can find out
who did this to her.

11:05.968 --> 11:07.001
<i>Let's go.</i>

11:07.069 --> 11:08.536
Uh, where are you
taking me?

11:08.604 --> 11:10.872
<i>Please, Ms. Sharp.</i>

11:10.939 --> 11:12.573
Don't make this harder
than it has to be.

11:12.641 --> 11:14.509
Look, David, if it's me
you want, you've got me.

11:14.577 --> 11:17.579
You win, but you can leave
Nina alone, please.

11:17.646 --> 11:19.748
Oh, I couldn't
possibly do that.

11:21.818 --> 11:24.652
Every horse
needs a carrot.

11:24.720 --> 11:27.923
Every mouse,
a piece of cheese.

11:29.760 --> 11:32.194
Incentive,
Agent Dunham--

11:32.262 --> 11:35.031
all creatures
need an incentive

11:35.099 --> 11:37.167
to perform tasks.

11:44.343 --> 11:46.511
Let's give you a little
better view, shall we?

11:50.482 --> 11:51.616
Oh, my God.

11:51.684 --> 11:54.552
<i>I'm going</i>
<i>to take you</i>

11:54.620 --> 11:56.521
through a series
of tests.

12:02.794 --> 12:05.662
This first one
may take some time.

12:07.999 --> 12:09.266
I want you--

12:09.333 --> 12:10.800
I know what
you want me to do.

12:10.868 --> 12:13.802
<i>You want me to turn</i>
<i>the lights on with my mind.</i>

12:13.870 --> 12:15.571
We did something
like this before.

12:15.638 --> 12:17.072
<i>You were trying</i>
<i>to activate my ability</i>

12:17.140 --> 12:18.440
<i>to cross</i>
<i>between universes.</i>

12:18.508 --> 12:20.108
And since you seem
perfectly capable

12:20.176 --> 12:21.743
<i>of doing that yourself,</i>
<i>what is this about?</i>

12:21.811 --> 12:23.311
Whatever you know,
miss Dunham,

12:23.379 --> 12:26.281
whatever you think you know
of your abilities,

12:26.348 --> 12:28.583
I assure you...

12:28.650 --> 12:31.586
your potential is...

12:31.653 --> 12:33.154
far greater.

12:33.221 --> 12:35.256
Olivia, listen to me!

12:35.324 --> 12:37.091
Don't do
what he says,

12:37.159 --> 12:38.626
please,
whatever happens.

12:42.732 --> 12:45.166
All righty, then.

12:45.234 --> 12:48.336
Let's begin,
shall we?

12:48.404 --> 12:50.872
Now, if...
as you seem to believe,

12:50.940 --> 12:53.842
you've done this before,

12:53.910 --> 12:56.178
then turning
the lights on

12:56.246 --> 12:59.749
should not be
any problem, should it?

13:26.441 --> 13:29.411
Perhaps this will help you
get started.

13:31.614 --> 13:34.449
Oh, you son of a bitch.
Leave her alone!

13:34.517 --> 13:37.586
Don't waste all that emotion
on me, Miss Dunham.

13:37.654 --> 13:39.822
Turn on the light.

13:48.098 --> 13:49.966
<i>I-I can't.</i>

13:53.236 --> 13:55.370
Please, can you just
leave her alone?

13:55.438 --> 13:56.538
Gladly.

13:56.605 --> 13:58.039
You know
what you have to do.

13:58.107 --> 13:59.574
Just one light,

13:59.642 --> 14:03.644
<i>and we won't have</i>
<i>to hurt her anymore.</i>

14:30.609 --> 14:33.410
I can't.
Please stop.

14:33.478 --> 14:35.545
I ca--
I just can't right now.

14:35.613 --> 14:37.147
I'm--I'm tired,

14:37.215 --> 14:39.650
and I just need rest.

14:46.257 --> 14:47.357
Very well.

14:52.898 --> 14:54.966
<i>I'll give you</i>
<i>your rest.</i>

15:00.039 --> 15:03.675
We'll try this again
in, uh, an hour.

15:18.657 --> 15:19.590
<i>Wait. Stop.</i>

15:19.658 --> 15:21.959
What?
What do you see?

15:22.027 --> 15:23.361
<i>I don't see anything.</i>

15:23.428 --> 15:25.496
But I really have to pee, and
I don't want to miss anything.

15:25.563 --> 15:27.931
I've had the same issue
for the past ten minutes.

15:27.999 --> 15:30.400
Great. Well, you won't have
to wait too much longer.

15:30.468 --> 15:33.670
We can't dig
any deeper because--

15:33.738 --> 15:36.173
hold on a second.

15:36.241 --> 15:39.977
<i>If I decrease the chrome</i>
<i>and the saturation...</i>

15:43.615 --> 15:47.050
That looks
like a person.

15:47.118 --> 15:48.819
<i>Hello.</i>

15:48.886 --> 15:51.120
Can facial rec tell us
who this guy is?

15:51.188 --> 15:53.522
Send me a capture of the image.
I'll forward it to FBI.

15:53.590 --> 15:55.791
They can cross-reference
with Interpol's database.

15:55.859 --> 15:59.094
Clearly he works
for that harridan Nina.

15:59.162 --> 16:01.262
It's who Nina's working for
that worries me.

16:01.330 --> 16:03.398
I've been racking my brain
trying to figure out--

16:03.465 --> 16:05.700
why would Nina be dosing Olivia
with Cortexiphan?

16:05.768 --> 16:06.968
But then
it occurred to me.

16:07.036 --> 16:08.770
The only person who's ever done
anything like that,

16:08.838 --> 16:12.040
at least in my timeline,
was David Robert Jones.

16:12.108 --> 16:13.909
Maybe he's trying to do
the same thing again.

16:13.977 --> 16:16.145
- Do what?
- Activate Olivia.

16:16.212 --> 16:17.280
For what purpose?

16:17.347 --> 16:19.049
I don't know.
We could never figure it out.

16:19.116 --> 16:20.751
But maybe
it's for the same reasons now.

16:20.818 --> 16:22.853
Yes.

16:22.921 --> 16:26.490
His goal is the same.

16:27.726 --> 16:30.194
You, talk to me.

16:30.261 --> 16:32.496
<i>What do you know</i>
<i>about David Robert Jones?</i>

16:32.564 --> 16:35.065
What do you know
about Olivia?

16:35.133 --> 16:37.734
She needs you.

16:44.267 --> 16:46.668
- God, he's been shot.
- Check his breathing, dear.

16:47.036 --> 16:48.103
There's no exit wound.

16:48.170 --> 16:49.471
That bullet's still
in him, Walter.

16:49.539 --> 16:51.473
- - His breathing is shallow.
Pulse is weak.

16:51.541 --> 16:53.075
There's no breath sound
from his left side.

16:53.142 --> 16:55.443
His lung must have
collapsed...

16:55.511 --> 16:57.611
If he has lungs.

16:57.679 --> 16:59.380
<i>Oh, dear God,</i>
<i>I have no idea</i>

16:59.448 --> 17:01.716
if this man's physiology
is similar to ours at all.

17:01.783 --> 17:03.384
It is--at least that's what
you told me in my timeline.

17:03.451 --> 17:06.686
I suppose I have
no reason to doubt myself.

17:06.753 --> 17:08.288
Walter, should I call
the paramedics?

17:08.355 --> 17:10.021
They'll just take him
to a hospital.

17:10.089 --> 17:11.757
He'll have a better chance
of surviving with me.

17:11.825 --> 17:13.759
We need to cut this bullet out
and reinflate the lung.

17:13.827 --> 17:15.260
Please get my medical kit,
quickly, dear.

17:15.328 --> 17:17.462
Peter,
put pressure here.

17:17.530 --> 17:18.864
Walter,
he is an observer.

17:18.932 --> 17:20.199
They only show up
at significant events.

17:20.266 --> 17:21.967
That he's here must mean
it's important.

17:22.035 --> 17:23.636
Well, who could have
shot him, and why?

17:23.703 --> 17:25.137
Well, I don't know,
but he's here.

17:25.204 --> 17:26.872
He must have something
to tell us.

17:26.940 --> 17:28.874
He said, "She needs you."
He was talking about Olivia.

17:28.942 --> 17:30.276
Ah, damn it.

17:30.343 --> 17:31.944
Here, here, here.

17:32.012 --> 17:33.112
- Bishop.
<i>- It's Lincoln.</i>

17:33.179 --> 17:34.380
We got the image
you pulled.

17:34.448 --> 17:36.015
They're running it
through facial recognition now.

17:36.083 --> 17:37.549
How long do you think before
oe have an I.D. On that guy?

17:37.617 --> 17:38.717
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

17:38.785 --> 17:40.119
We never tried it with an image
this weak before.

17:40.187 --> 17:41.153
It could take time.

17:41.221 --> 17:42.387
What do you think
the chances are

17:42.455 --> 17:43.689
we're gonna get lucky
and Nina starts talking?

17:43.756 --> 17:45.224
I wouldn't count on it.

17:45.292 --> 17:47.393
She's got her lawyer
in with her now.

17:47.460 --> 17:48.961
<i>Short of the sixth amendment</i>
<i>being repealed,</i>

17:49.028 --> 17:52.998
<i>I don't see her cooperating</i>
<i>anytime soon.</i>

17:53.066 --> 17:55.367
I am so sorry that
you have to go through this.

17:55.435 --> 17:57.068
Oh, it's not your fault.

17:57.136 --> 17:59.237
I mean, none of this
is your fault.

18:00.806 --> 18:02.407
No, listen to me.

18:02.474 --> 18:04.242
I know Jones.

18:04.309 --> 18:05.843
I know what
he's capable of.

18:05.911 --> 18:09.013
William fired him
because he was unhinged.

18:09.081 --> 18:11.049
You cannot give in.

18:11.116 --> 18:13.719
Yeah, but if I don't, then he's
going to keep torturing you,

18:13.786 --> 18:17.055
<i>and I can't have that.</i>
<i>I won't.</i>

18:19.125 --> 18:20.258
Okay. Nina?

18:20.326 --> 18:23.763
Nina...

18:23.830 --> 18:26.198
You--you have to help
activate me.

18:26.266 --> 18:27.933
Olive, I-I...

18:28.001 --> 18:30.936
All right, Cortexiphan
is based on emotions.

18:31.004 --> 18:32.605
For me,
it was always fear--

18:32.672 --> 18:35.107
not fear for myself, but fear
for the people that I loved.

18:35.175 --> 18:36.942
Now, Jones is--
he's using that,

18:37.010 --> 18:39.045
hoping that it will access
my abilities.

18:39.112 --> 18:40.413
But something's happened.

18:40.480 --> 18:41.614
W-w-what do you mean?

18:41.681 --> 18:45.384
Well, because
of the Cortexiphan...

18:45.452 --> 18:49.121
I-I-I can't remember certain
aspects of our relationship.

18:49.189 --> 18:51.957
I-I can't remember
things about us.

18:52.025 --> 18:53.659
And without
that connection,

18:53.727 --> 18:56.162
I-I-I can't do
what he wants.

18:56.230 --> 18:57.397
It just--it--
it won't work.

18:57.464 --> 19:01.067
Now, I--
now, I-I don't understand.

19:01.135 --> 19:05.204
Y-you don't remember
our life together?

19:05.272 --> 19:08.741
No, I-I-I remember, but...

19:08.809 --> 19:10.910
I just...

19:10.978 --> 19:15.081
I just need for you
to help me feel it.

19:15.149 --> 19:17.951
Just--just help me remember
the details,

19:18.019 --> 19:19.687
what we--what we meant
to each other.

19:19.755 --> 19:21.088
Mm.
Maybe if you could--

19:21.156 --> 19:23.124
if you could just
tell me a story,

19:23.192 --> 19:27.228
maybe the first day that Rachel
and I came to live with you.

19:27.295 --> 19:31.098
Uh, oh, well, um...

19:31.166 --> 19:33.434
Mm, a social worker
brought you and your sister

19:33.502 --> 19:36.338
up from Jacksonville
on the train.

19:36.406 --> 19:40.276
I-I met you
at Penn Station.

19:40.344 --> 19:43.680
You really
don't remember?

19:45.016 --> 19:48.852
I remember the train,
I think, but...

19:48.920 --> 19:51.255
Just--just keep going.

19:51.322 --> 19:53.457
Well, I brought
you girls home...

19:53.524 --> 19:55.158
To our old house
in the Catskills.

19:55.226 --> 19:57.527
And I couldn't sleep
that night.

19:57.595 --> 19:59.963
And so you came
into my room.

20:00.031 --> 20:02.298
And you sat with me,

20:02.366 --> 20:05.434
but I-I can't remember
what we talked about.

20:05.502 --> 20:10.072
Okay, I--
you were scared.

20:10.139 --> 20:11.706
I mean, after what
you'd been through,

20:11.774 --> 20:14.576
coming to a new home with
a woman that you hardly knew--

20:14.644 --> 20:16.177
and I kept calling you
"Ms. Sharp."

20:18.381 --> 20:20.816
Yes, you did.
That's true.

20:20.884 --> 20:22.485
And I told you

20:22.552 --> 20:25.989
that you didn't need
to worry,

20:26.056 --> 20:28.892
that we were
a family now...

20:28.960 --> 20:32.329
And that whatever happened,
we had each other.

20:32.396 --> 20:34.097
And we'd be okay.

20:36.400 --> 20:39.368
And I-I kissed you
on the forehead.

20:39.436 --> 20:42.171
I kissed you
good night,

20:42.239 --> 20:45.574
and you called me
"Nina."

20:45.641 --> 20:49.344
That was the first time
you'd ever done that.

21:00.523 --> 21:04.294
I can only
remember pieces...

21:04.361 --> 21:06.296
Just fragments.

21:06.364 --> 21:07.497
It's like looking

21:07.565 --> 21:11.435
at a photo album
of somebody else's life.

21:14.372 --> 21:17.141
This isn't going to work.

21:17.209 --> 21:21.479
I don't want them
to keep hurting you, but...

21:21.547 --> 21:24.481
The only person that this
has ever worked with is Peter.

21:26.684 --> 21:28.986
Peter Bishop?

21:29.053 --> 21:31.656
The Cortexiphan,
my abilities--

21:31.723 --> 21:34.191
it's only ever worked
when I've been around him.

21:34.259 --> 21:35.760
Aah!

21:35.827 --> 21:36.928
Nina?

21:36.995 --> 21:38.696
- Oh!
- Nina, are you okay?

21:38.764 --> 21:41.432
Oh, oh!
I-I-I-I-I don't know.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.500
Oh!

21:45.603 --> 21:46.670
Hey!

21:46.738 --> 21:48.806
<i>I need somebody</i>
<i>in here now!</i>

21:48.874 --> 21:51.175
<i>Stand back.</i>

21:54.713 --> 21:57.048
What is it?

21:57.115 --> 22:00.151
She, uh--she needs
medical attention now.

22:00.219 --> 22:02.553
<i>Look, you can tell</i>
<i>your boss</i>

22:02.621 --> 22:05.890
that if she dies,
then his leverage dies.

22:09.862 --> 22:12.129
Bring the gurney.

22:36.421 --> 22:37.688
Well?

22:37.755 --> 22:40.991
I know why it's not working.
She needs Peter Bishop.

22:41.059 --> 22:43.593
Apparently, she can't be
activated unless he's present.

22:43.661 --> 22:46.230
Somehow I knew
he'd be trouble.

22:49.501 --> 22:51.702
<i>Agent Dunham had asked me</i>
<i>not to share this with anyone,</i>

22:51.769 --> 22:54.237
but under
the circumstances...

22:54.305 --> 22:57.007
That man paid a visit to Olivia
several weeks ago.

22:57.075 --> 22:58.008
What?

22:58.076 --> 22:59.309
At that Brooklyn Opera House,

22:59.376 --> 23:01.010
while the two of you
were on the other side.

23:01.078 --> 23:02.178
What did he want?

23:02.246 --> 23:04.181
Apparently
to warn her.

23:04.249 --> 23:07.617
He said he'd seen all possible
futures, and in every one,

23:07.685 --> 23:09.252
Olivia was going
to die.

23:12.257 --> 23:14.324
Peter.

23:14.392 --> 23:15.392
Yeah.

23:15.460 --> 23:18.628
You said this man exists
out of time.

23:18.696 --> 23:22.464
What if, at the opera house,
weeks ago,

23:22.532 --> 23:24.633
he was referring to events
that are happening now?

23:24.701 --> 23:26.802
Walter, if he was trying to
warn her about this abduction,

23:26.869 --> 23:28.403
do you think maybe
he knows where she is?

23:28.471 --> 23:31.072
I suppose.

23:31.140 --> 23:33.641
<i>Dr. Bishop, do you have</i>
<i>any reasonable expectation</i>

23:33.709 --> 23:35.543
<i>when this man</i>
<i>will wake up?</i>

23:35.610 --> 23:37.478
I've treated him
as best I can,

23:37.545 --> 23:39.580
but he's gone
into septic shock.

23:39.647 --> 23:41.682
His vital organs
are shutting down one by one.

23:41.749 --> 23:44.585
<i>I'm afraid there's nothing</i>
<i>anyone can do for him now.</i>

23:44.653 --> 23:47.087
That was H.Q.

23:47.155 --> 23:49.423
Found a match on the man
in Olivia's apartment.

23:49.491 --> 23:50.758
His name
is Leland Spivey.

23:50.826 --> 23:52.894
His last known address
was an apartment in Deerfield.

23:52.962 --> 23:54.662
I'll deploy a S.W.A.T. unit
to his place.

23:54.729 --> 23:56.130
Uh, you're not gonna
find him.

23:56.198 --> 23:58.298
Leland Spivey died in
a car accident three years ago.

23:58.366 --> 24:01.301
<i>Then how was he in Agent</i>
<i>Dunham's apartment weeks ago?</i>

24:01.369 --> 24:03.136
I don't know.
Maybe, uh--

24:03.204 --> 24:05.439
maybe if Jones can cross over
at will to the other side,

24:05.507 --> 24:06.974
he's bringing other people
back with him?

24:07.041 --> 24:09.376
You think the guy on the tape
is Spivey's doppelganger?

24:09.444 --> 24:11.945
It doesn't matter.
It's a dead end.

24:12.013 --> 24:15.282
The only way to find Olivia
is through him.

24:15.350 --> 24:16.683
You heard Dr. Bishop.
He's dying.

24:16.751 --> 24:18.785
But he's not dead.

24:18.853 --> 24:20.520
He still has
brain function.

24:22.690 --> 24:24.224
Peter,
you're not suggesting--

24:24.291 --> 24:25.959
- Why not?
- Suggesting what?

24:26.027 --> 24:28.462
He wants to go
into the observer's mind.

24:28.530 --> 24:30.130
Is that possible?

24:30.198 --> 24:32.466
Walter, you know the only way
that I'm going to find Olivia

24:32.534 --> 24:35.235
is if you can put me
into his consciousness.

24:35.303 --> 24:37.772
Peter, this man's brain
could operate in ways

24:37.840 --> 24:40.575
we can't even imagine.

24:40.642 --> 24:44.178
And if he dies
when you are in his mind,

24:44.246 --> 24:46.414
you could well die too.

24:46.482 --> 24:48.649
Can you do it?

24:57.693 --> 24:59.293
Yes.

24:59.361 --> 25:02.362
Good. Then let's get started.
We don't have much time.

25:19.432 --> 25:22.134
<i>Okay, Peter, here we go.</i>

26:02.421 --> 26:04.055
The beginning
of all things.

26:04.123 --> 26:08.259
I have been privileged
to witness it...

26:08.327 --> 26:11.729
As I am
to witness my end.

26:15.502 --> 26:17.202
You know
that you're dying?

26:17.270 --> 26:20.539
Yes.
I was shot.

26:20.607 --> 26:21.574
By who?

26:21.641 --> 26:23.543
That is not
the relevant question.

26:23.610 --> 26:26.378
Yes.
Olivia.

26:26.446 --> 26:28.347
You said
she needs my help.

26:28.415 --> 26:29.982
Does that mean you know
where she is?

26:30.049 --> 26:32.251
That, too,
is not relevant...

26:32.319 --> 26:33.986
Not yet.

26:34.054 --> 26:37.056
I am sorry,
but I do not have long,

26:37.124 --> 26:40.627
and there is much I need you
to understand before I go.

26:47.034 --> 26:48.934
Who...

26:49.002 --> 26:51.070
Or what...

26:51.137 --> 26:53.138
Are you?

26:55.842 --> 27:00.411
I am called "September."

27:00.479 --> 27:03.248
But that is
a code designation

27:03.315 --> 27:06.017
given to members
of our scientific team.

27:08.621 --> 27:10.656
Scientists.

27:12.826 --> 27:14.193
From where?

27:14.261 --> 27:17.697
A more apt question
would be, "from when?"

27:17.765 --> 27:21.068
We are you--

27:21.136 --> 27:23.270
were.

27:23.338 --> 27:25.939
Human...

27:26.007 --> 27:29.843
Many generations
after your lifetime.

27:31.845 --> 27:35.280
We are one of countless
possible futures

27:35.348 --> 27:38.416
for humanity.

27:38.484 --> 27:42.053
Our technology has uniquely
afforded us the ability

27:42.121 --> 27:45.056
to travel within
and outside of time

27:45.124 --> 27:48.659
so that we may observe
our beginnings.

27:50.963 --> 27:53.964
But you've done a lot more
than observe.

27:56.635 --> 27:59.238
Yes.

27:59.305 --> 28:03.676
It was my attempt to rectify
the mistake I made.

28:03.744 --> 28:06.145
What mistake?

28:11.051 --> 28:13.886
Is that...?

28:13.954 --> 28:16.455
Your real father...

28:16.523 --> 28:19.025
Developing the cure
that would have saved your life.

28:23.864 --> 28:25.398
Excuse me.
What are you doing in here?

28:25.466 --> 28:28.434
Forgive me,
Dr. Bishop.

28:28.502 --> 28:30.569
I did not mean
to disturb you.

28:30.637 --> 28:34.139
<i>I am an admirer.</i>

28:34.207 --> 28:37.209
Your father
found the cure,

28:37.276 --> 28:40.679
but in my desire
to witness the moment,

28:40.746 --> 28:44.682
I inadvertently distracted him
from discovering it.

28:44.750 --> 28:48.085
I already know
all that.

28:48.153 --> 28:51.087
Walter told me,
but what were you doing there?

28:51.155 --> 28:52.822
I'm sorry
for disturbing you.

28:52.890 --> 28:55.358
It was important.

28:56.960 --> 28:59.161
You are important.

28:59.229 --> 29:02.765
It was why I could not
allow you to drown

29:02.833 --> 29:04.867
at the bottom
of Reiden Lake,

29:04.935 --> 29:09.072
why it was necessary to allow
the other Dr. Bishop

29:09.139 --> 29:11.474
to cure you instead.

29:13.812 --> 29:16.914
Despite my efforts
to set things right,

29:16.982 --> 29:20.418
these actions only culminated
in further corruption

29:20.486 --> 29:22.653
of the timeline.

29:25.523 --> 29:28.091
The war between
the two universes

29:28.159 --> 29:31.026
drastically altered
destinies

29:31.094 --> 29:35.630
and brought about a child
that was not meant to be.

29:39.501 --> 29:41.435
What child?

29:41.503 --> 29:43.671
Your son...

29:45.508 --> 29:47.509
Henry.

29:50.646 --> 29:52.681
My what?

29:54.150 --> 29:57.120
He was born
to the wrong Olivia Dunham

29:57.188 --> 29:59.423
due to a series
of circumstances

29:59.490 --> 30:03.293
that never
should have happened.

30:03.361 --> 30:04.594
This event...

30:04.662 --> 30:06.797
would have
irrevocably altered

30:06.864 --> 30:09.232
everything
that was to come.

30:11.535 --> 30:14.203
Henry.

30:17.607 --> 30:18.706
I have a son.

30:18.774 --> 30:21.509
Had.

30:21.577 --> 30:24.512
When you made
the sacrifice

30:24.580 --> 30:27.015
to step into that machine,

30:27.083 --> 30:31.721
you were not the only one
who ceased to exist.

30:31.789 --> 30:34.991
So would he.

30:39.563 --> 30:42.699
I believed at the time
that would be the end of it.

30:42.766 --> 30:44.501
<i>I cannot explain,</i>

30:44.568 --> 30:50.107
<i>but it is clear</i>
<i>that I was wrong.</i>

30:50.174 --> 30:52.776
You have managed
to return

30:52.844 --> 30:54.678
in physical form.

30:57.282 --> 30:58.949
I suspect...

30:59.017 --> 31:01.952
<i>This will provide</i>
<i>an opportunity</i>

31:02.020 --> 31:04.588
for you
to put things right.

31:04.655 --> 31:06.790
She is the one...

31:06.857 --> 31:09.426
the Olivia Dunham
from whom your shared future

31:09.494 --> 31:12.796
was meant to spring.

31:12.864 --> 31:14.865
This must be,

31:14.932 --> 31:18.634
<i>and everything will be</i>
<i>as it was intended.</i>

31:18.702 --> 31:22.305
<i>You must find a wa--</i>

31:22.372 --> 31:24.440
they are coming.
- Who?

31:24.508 --> 31:26.109
You need to go.

31:28.179 --> 31:29.446
What's happening?

31:29.514 --> 31:31.782
There is no time.

31:31.850 --> 31:33.818
I'm going to need you
to do something for me.

31:33.885 --> 31:36.187
I'm not doing anything till you
tell me where to find Olivia--

31:37.556 --> 31:39.391
For that,
you have only to go home.

31:39.459 --> 31:41.494
I know
that I have to go home.

31:41.561 --> 31:43.095
<i>I know I have to get back</i>
<i>to my timeline,</i>

31:43.163 --> 31:45.331
but I'm talking about
this Olivia in this timeline.

31:45.398 --> 31:46.365
Go home--

31:48.202 --> 31:49.535
<i>Walter, what's happening?</i>

31:49.603 --> 31:50.936
I don't know.

31:51.004 --> 31:53.139
His heart rate
is suddenly spiking.

31:53.207 --> 31:55.441
Peter,
did you make contact?

31:55.509 --> 31:57.118
<i>Was he able to tell you</i>
<i>where Olivia is?</i>

31:57.119 --> 31:57.699
No.

31:57.707 --> 32:00.445
Give me 30 milligrams
of propafenone.

32:00.446 --> 32:01.780
Walter.

32:07.020 --> 32:08.887
Somebody want to tell me
what the hell just happened?

32:17.605 --> 32:20.306
I don't understand how this
table just knocked itself over.

32:20.374 --> 32:22.342
A dying man suddenly vanishes
in front of our eyes,

32:22.410 --> 32:24.311
and the thing you're wondering
is, "What happened the table?"

32:24.379 --> 32:25.746
Among other things.

32:25.813 --> 32:28.082
He just stopped suddenly,

32:28.149 --> 32:30.151
and he said,
"They're coming."

32:30.218 --> 32:31.452
And then I got yanked out.

32:31.520 --> 32:34.622
Well, I didn't do
any yanking.

32:34.690 --> 32:35.690
It must have been them.

32:35.758 --> 32:38.327
The "them"
who were coming.

32:38.394 --> 32:41.363
You're certain he had
nothing else to offer?

32:41.431 --> 32:42.631
Mm-mm.

32:42.699 --> 32:43.866
He just kept on saying

32:43.933 --> 32:47.402
how I needed to get back
to my timeline and my Olivia.

32:47.470 --> 32:49.003
Your Olivia
and our Olivia?

32:49.071 --> 32:53.941
I thought they were
one and the same to you.

32:54.009 --> 32:56.711
Then we're right back
where we started...

32:56.778 --> 32:58.979
With Nina Sharp
being our only real lead.

32:59.047 --> 33:01.148
Agent Lee, I think
she's been on ice long enough.

33:01.216 --> 33:04.118
Let's see if she's ready
to deal.

33:06.555 --> 33:09.590
You tried, Peter.

33:09.658 --> 33:12.794
It was a Valiant effort
nonetheless.

33:12.861 --> 33:15.897
<i>You're very lucky</i>
<i>to have made it out.</i>

33:15.965 --> 33:18.066
I can't imagine
what would have happened

33:18.133 --> 33:20.702
if this observer
had disappeared

33:20.770 --> 33:24.806
with your consciousness
still inside his brain.

33:24.874 --> 33:26.808
<i>He existed</i>
<i>outside of time.</i>

33:26.876 --> 33:29.878
He could've helped me
to find Olivia.

33:39.589 --> 33:44.159
He kept on saying
that I needed to get home.

33:44.227 --> 33:48.330
What if he was being literal
this time--

33:48.398 --> 33:50.699
not home to my timeline,
just to my house?

33:50.767 --> 33:52.868
What do you think--
that she's waiting for you

33:52.935 --> 33:54.870
at your house
after she's been kidnapped?

33:54.938 --> 33:56.538
<i>I suppose it makes</i>
<i>as much sense</i>

33:56.606 --> 33:58.073
as anything else
that's gone on here.

33:58.141 --> 33:59.441
It doesn't make
any sense.

33:59.508 --> 34:01.109
My point exactly.

34:01.177 --> 34:03.544
I know that sounds crazy, but
I got to at least check it out.

34:03.612 --> 34:05.046
Maybe there's a clue there
that can point me

34:05.113 --> 34:06.280
in the direction
of Olivia.

34:06.348 --> 34:09.649
I'll call you from there
if I find anything.

34:21.161 --> 34:24.964
Olivia?

34:25.032 --> 34:26.599
Olivia!

34:26.667 --> 34:28.567
You here?

34:32.606 --> 34:34.639
Where is she?

34:37.177 --> 34:39.411
I said,
"where is she?"

35:13.415 --> 35:15.449
Hello?

35:23.057 --> 35:25.191
Peter?

35:25.258 --> 35:28.794
Peter?

35:28.862 --> 35:30.797
Olivia.

35:30.864 --> 35:33.099
Olivia, are you okay?
Did they hurt you?

35:33.167 --> 35:36.568
No, no.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

35:39.739 --> 35:43.409
Nice of you to join us,
Mr. Bishop.

35:43.477 --> 35:45.812
By now,
you must have realized

35:45.879 --> 35:48.215
that your every word
was being monitored.

35:48.282 --> 35:50.985
<i>If I overheard you correctly,</i>
<i>you believe this man</i>

35:51.053 --> 35:55.457
will be helpful in evoking
an emotional response,

35:55.524 --> 35:57.959
so let's give it a try,
shall we?

35:59.262 --> 36:02.799
Unless, of course,
I was mistaken.

36:06.436 --> 36:09.372
I find your silence
encouraging.

36:09.440 --> 36:12.242
Don't do it, Olivia.
I'm afraid you must,

36:12.310 --> 36:13.544
or Leland here

36:13.611 --> 36:16.014
will start slicing off
pieces of your friend.

36:37.069 --> 36:38.803
Excellent,
Agent Dunham.

36:38.871 --> 36:41.072
I knew you had it
in you.

36:45.111 --> 36:47.011
Impressive.

36:51.817 --> 36:53.285
What are you doing,
Olivia?

36:53.353 --> 36:56.388
I'm doing what you wanted.
I'm turning on the lights.

36:56.456 --> 36:58.757
What?
No, Olivia, don't.

36:58.825 --> 37:00.925
- You're not Nina.
- What are you talking about?

37:00.993 --> 37:02.893
My high-school graduation--

37:02.961 --> 37:04.495
you told me
that now I was an adult.

37:04.562 --> 37:06.363
I was no longer allowed
to call you "Ms. Sharp."

37:06.431 --> 37:08.699
That was the first time
I called you "Nina."

37:10.202 --> 37:11.201
Get her out.

37:35.240 --> 37:36.373
Peter?

37:36.441 --> 37:38.442
Olivia.

37:38.510 --> 37:39.610
How did you do that?

37:39.677 --> 37:42.646
How did you know
how to concentrate your power?

37:42.714 --> 37:45.315
Well, I, uh--I didn't.
I just know that...

37:45.383 --> 37:47.784
<i>When I was a little girl,</i>
<i>I did something similar,</i>

37:47.852 --> 37:49.720
and that if they
brought you to me,

37:49.788 --> 37:51.655
then you might give me
what I needed to do it again.

37:51.723 --> 37:52.989
Okay.

37:53.057 --> 37:55.091
Come on.

37:58.128 --> 38:01.196
Best be on our way.

38:01.264 --> 38:04.265
Be a good fellow and keep them
occupied, will you?

38:12.508 --> 38:15.143
Olivia.

38:15.211 --> 38:16.945
I got you.
You're gonna be okay.

38:17.013 --> 38:18.681
I'm here.

38:18.748 --> 38:20.182
On your feet,
both of you.

38:20.250 --> 38:21.217
She's having a seizure.

38:21.284 --> 38:23.719
I said get up.

38:33.865 --> 38:36.300
Hey!

38:42.440 --> 38:44.741
Oh, God.
Come on.

38:51.047 --> 38:53.750
Please be so kind
as to step aside.

38:57.455 --> 38:59.189
Ladies first.

38:59.257 --> 39:00.290
Jones...

39:00.358 --> 39:02.593
Don't move.

39:08.267 --> 39:12.538
That was quite a display you put
on in there, Miss Dunham.

39:12.606 --> 39:17.577
Your love for this man must be
something quite profound.

39:17.644 --> 39:19.279
Jones, you can step away
from the portal.

39:19.346 --> 39:23.382
Good-bye for now,
Agent Dunham.

39:31.124 --> 39:34.159
It would seem
there are some fringe benefits

39:34.227 --> 39:37.429
<i>to having one's body</i>
<i>reassembled</i>

39:37.497 --> 39:39.298
at an atomic level.

39:43.803 --> 39:45.603
Peter, I--
did you see that?

39:45.671 --> 39:46.671
I--

39:46.739 --> 39:49.807
Oh, I got you.
I got you.

39:49.875 --> 39:51.576
Let's get you
out of here, okay?

39:51.644 --> 39:53.311
Okay.

40:01.320 --> 40:02.520
Yeah.

40:02.588 --> 40:04.256
Yeah,
Plainfield Memorial.

40:04.323 --> 40:06.091
But, Lincoln, make sure
that you tell the EMTs

40:06.158 --> 40:08.660
that she's gonna need
Diazepam.

40:08.728 --> 40:11.930
All right, thanks.

40:11.997 --> 40:13.465
All right, first responders
are on their way.

40:13.532 --> 40:14.666
You're gonna be fine.

40:14.734 --> 40:16.901
It's okay.
I'm feeling better now.

40:19.238 --> 40:21.606
<i>I guess all the energy</i>
<i>that I expended</i>

40:21.674 --> 40:24.175
did a number
on my nervous system.

40:27.280 --> 40:29.114
Maybe...

40:31.417 --> 40:33.218
But maybe it was me...

40:37.290 --> 40:40.826
Just by being close to you,
like Walter said.

40:40.894 --> 40:44.396
Well, Walter isn't
always right.

40:44.464 --> 40:46.565
Yeah, neither am I.

40:55.977 --> 40:59.313
At the gas station
just before you got taken,

40:59.381 --> 41:03.250
you were ready
to come home with me,

41:03.318 --> 41:06.221
and I was ready to think
that that was okay.

41:08.791 --> 41:11.493
But it wasn't.

41:13.029 --> 41:15.864
It was a mistake...

41:15.932 --> 41:18.266
One that I promised myself
I'd never make again.

41:20.435 --> 41:22.169
This isn't the same
as what happened--

41:22.236 --> 41:23.870
I saw her.

41:23.938 --> 41:26.706
I saw my Olivia--the one
that I am supposed to be with,

41:26.774 --> 41:28.742
the only one
that I'm supposed to be with.

41:28.810 --> 41:32.378
Peter, I don't understand
what's happening to me

41:32.446 --> 41:33.913
any more than you do.

41:33.981 --> 41:35.481
But that doesn't change
what I do know,

41:35.549 --> 41:37.550
what you know--
that if you look at me--

41:37.617 --> 41:39.685
if you--if you look--
if you look into my eyes,

41:39.753 --> 41:41.887
then you can see
that I am her.

41:41.955 --> 41:42.888
No.

41:42.956 --> 41:46.659
No, you have
her memories,

41:46.727 --> 41:48.061
or you have
my memories of her.

41:48.128 --> 41:49.562
You're a projection or--
I don't know what.

41:49.630 --> 41:50.997
But when I looked
into your eyes,

41:51.065 --> 41:54.200
what I saw was what
I wanted to see.

41:54.268 --> 41:57.871
I know she's out there...

41:57.939 --> 42:02.042
My Olivia,
in my timeline,

42:02.110 --> 42:04.244
waiting for me.

42:04.312 --> 42:06.880
And I let myself forget that,
so I'm sorry, Olivia.

42:06.948 --> 42:10.984
And I'll be sure that Walter
can fix you up somehow

42:11.052 --> 42:12.385
and give you back
your life.

42:12.453 --> 42:14.520
But for right now, I think
it's better if I just stay away.

42:14.588 --> 42:16.589
Okay, Peter,
I-I-I'm in love with you,

42:16.657 --> 42:18.991
and I-I can't just--
just turn that off now.

42:19.059 --> 42:21.627
<i>I don't want to lose you.</i>

42:21.695 --> 42:23.930
W-where are you going?

42:23.997 --> 42:27.633
Home.

42:27.701 --> 42:30.136
<i>I have to go home.</i>

42:35.661 --> 42:37.561
<i>I got additionals</i>
<i>on the south side.</i>

42:38.586 --> 42:40.386
<i>Just swing it around.</i>
