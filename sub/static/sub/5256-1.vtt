That's what I'm all ab--

09:49.256 --> 09:50.221
[exhales]

09:50.223 --> 09:50.889
All about.

09:50.891 --> 09:55.493
And so cope
then breaks into marsh's sites

09:55.495 --> 09:58.597
And starts pillaging
and stealing.

09:58.599 --> 10:00.532
Marsh finds out about this.

10:00.534 --> 10:02.033
[bleep] livid.

10:02.035 --> 10:03.268
What the f?

10:03.270 --> 10:05.737
What do you think
you're doing, mister man?

10:05.739 --> 10:07.572
You're not--why would you--

10:07.574 --> 10:09.207
And cope is like, listen.

10:09.209 --> 10:11.443
This is the game we're playing.

10:11.445 --> 10:12.544
I was here.

10:12.546 --> 10:14.012
I found these bones.

10:14.014 --> 10:19.718
Just 'cause you're not here yet
doesn't mean nothing to me.

10:19.720 --> 10:23.254
[stammers]

10:23.256 --> 10:24.723
Eh.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.424
[both laugh]

10:26.426 --> 10:29.294
Well, cope finds this dinosaur,

10:29.296 --> 10:31.563
And he starts publishing
all this information.

10:31.565 --> 10:35.100
And marsh gets there,
and he's like, wow, that's--

10:35.102 --> 10:36.301
I mean, that's neat.

10:36.303 --> 10:39.671
Um, why did you put his head
on his ass?

10:39.673 --> 10:43.742
It's supposed to be
on the other end, you dingus!

10:43.744 --> 10:45.443
Marsh takes the head,

10:45.445 --> 10:48.680
Puts it on the tail,
and it fits perfectly.

10:48.682 --> 10:52.150
And marsh is like,
einstein isn't invented yet,

10:52.152 --> 10:53.218
But you're no einstein.

10:53.220 --> 10:55.820
So marsh--
oh, no, no, no, no.

10:55.822 --> 10:58.456
Cope is like, screw you.

10:58.458 --> 11:01.059
We are obviously not friends.

11:01.061 --> 11:02.494
Let the bone wars begin.

11:02.496 --> 11:05.363
- Dun-dun-dun-dun.
- Da-da-da-da.

11:05.365 --> 11:08.133
(mark)
a race breaks out to discover

11:08.135 --> 11:11.536
New dinosaur fossils
in council--

11:11.538 --> 11:16.107
In ccccomo--coun--
como bluff, wyoming.

11:16.109 --> 11:17.375
So you have these two pits.

11:17.377 --> 11:20.578
It's like, hey,
this discovery is pretty neat.

11:20.580 --> 11:23.915
And the other would be like,
nuh-uh!

11:23.917 --> 11:25.583
This and this
and this and this

11:25.585 --> 11:28.353
Then go with this and this
and this and this.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.221
And the other would go,
you wish, tuna fish.

11:30.223 --> 11:33.258
This and that
was part of this and that.

11:33.260 --> 11:35.160
The other would be like,
cool your jets.

11:35.162 --> 11:41.132
The two of them discovered
over 140 species of dinosaurs,

11:41.134 --> 11:43.401
But they were, like, fighting,

11:43.403 --> 11:46.571
Throwing dirt
in each other's pits,

11:46.573 --> 11:49.974
Sabotaging their own findings.

11:49.976 --> 11:50.875
Marsh would be like,

11:50.877 --> 11:53.411
Don't let cope
get ahold of these.

11:53.413 --> 11:54.112
Blow it up.

11:54.114 --> 11:56.748
Just so cope wouldn't find them.

11:56.750 --> 11:59.751
Cope was like, don't let
marsh get ahold of these.

11:59.753 --> 12:01.152
Blow these up.

12:01.154 --> 12:02.854
This is insane.

12:02.856 --> 12:05.290
They even had a dirtball fight.

12:05.292 --> 12:07.592
[laughing]
these are two of the people

12:07.594 --> 12:10.595
That created paleontology.

12:10.597 --> 12:13.465
They're acting like
spoiled little babies.

12:13.467 --> 12:15.834
Put diapers on 'em!

12:15.836 --> 12:16.601
Give 'em a nuk.

12:16.603 --> 12:19.437
This went on then for 15 years.

12:19.439 --> 12:24.642
And marsh becomes
the head of u.S. Paleontology

12:24.644 --> 12:27.712
Because he discovered
the most bones

12:27.714 --> 12:28.780
And is like,

12:28.782 --> 12:32.183
All of the fossils collected
by cope

12:32.185 --> 12:35.153
Belong to the usgs.

12:35.155 --> 12:36.721
That's all cope had left,

12:36.723 --> 12:40.458
And marsh was trying to take
that [bleep] away from him.

12:40.460 --> 12:43.128
Cope was like, screw you.

12:43.130 --> 12:45.864
I'm going to fight you on this.

12:45.866 --> 12:47.499
Cope, it turned out,

12:47.501 --> 12:49.734
Had been collecting evidence

12:49.736 --> 12:55.006
That marsh was sabotaging
all this science

12:55.008 --> 12:56.508
This entire time,

12:56.510 --> 13:00.545
Back to new jersey,
to como bluffs.

13:00.547 --> 13:04.282
Cope gives
<i>the new york herald...</i>

13:04.284 --> 13:06.384
[laughs]

13:06.386 --> 13:09.120
All of these notes!

13:09.122 --> 13:11.356
I get delightful
when I'm drunk.

13:11.358 --> 13:14.025
<i>The new york herald</i>
publishi--

13:14.027 --> 13:16.361
Publicizes all this information,

13:16.363 --> 13:19.364
And it ruins marsh.

13:19.366 --> 13:20.465
[laughs]

13:20.467 --> 13:22.600
I got it.
Don't worry, guys.

13:22.602 --> 13:24.536
[chuckles]

13:24.538 --> 13:26.704
(mark)
this war, the bone wars,

13:26.706 --> 13:29.107
Established paleontology.

13:29.109 --> 13:31.943
But these two,
they're children.

13:31.945 --> 13:33.711
Cope was like, you know what?

13:33.713 --> 13:37.949
I hate marsh so much that,
when I die,

13:37.951 --> 13:40.752
I want my brain
weighed and measured.

13:40.754 --> 13:45.190
I bet my brain
is bigger than othniel marsh's.

13:45.192 --> 13:46.925
And so when he died,

13:46.927 --> 13:49.060
He had his brain cut out.

13:49.062 --> 13:52.831
And then marsh was like,
no, I don't want to do that.

13:52.833 --> 13:54.165
[chuckles]

13:54.167 --> 13:55.667
[laughs]

13:55.669 --> 13:57.268
Guys, let's eat!

13:57.270 --> 13:59.704
Let's enjoy
a mouthfil--ful.

13:59.706 --> 14:01.806
A what?

14:03.008 --> 14:05.944
You want us
to enjoy a what?

14:09.782 --> 14:11.583
[laughter]

14:14.019 --> 14:15.453
I mean,
I didn't do myself any favors.

14:15.455 --> 14:17.088
I really just made this drink.

14:17.090 --> 14:21.192
It's like...
You know.

14:21.194 --> 14:22.393
[both laugh]

14:22.395 --> 14:24.762
Let's talk about outer space.

14:24.764 --> 14:26.497
Hello, I'm jenny slate,

14:26.499 --> 14:29.100
And today
we're going to talk

14:29.102 --> 14:32.036
About arno penzias
and robert wilson

14:32.038 --> 14:35.740
And their beautiful
cosmic discovery.

14:35.742 --> 14:37.942
This is my dog's...

14:37.944 --> 14:38.610
Uh, penis,

14:38.612 --> 14:41.646
And then I've also
had his balls removed.

14:41.648 --> 14:43.414
- Aw, shame, shame.
- Reggie.

14:43.416 --> 14:46.017
"give me back my balls."
you can't have 'em.

14:46.019 --> 14:47.986
I took them away!

14:47.988 --> 14:50.288
But I have a full vagina.
[laughs]

14:50.290 --> 14:51.456
[clicks tongue]

14:51.458 --> 14:52.523
In 1960,

14:52.525 --> 14:57.829
Bell labs made this, like,
giant listening device for nasa.

14:57.831 --> 15:00.031
But then, by the time
they were ready to use it,

15:00.033 --> 15:01.432
A better thing had been built.

15:01.434 --> 15:02.867
So then it was just, like,
by itself,

15:02.869 --> 15:04.535
All by itself in new jersey.

15:04.537 --> 15:07.672
A lonely horn.
[sighs]

15:07.674 --> 15:09.307
But two scientists,

15:09.309 --> 15:11.376
Arno penzias and robert wilson,

15:11.378 --> 15:13.611
They were like, oh, whoa, whoa!

15:13.613 --> 15:14.412
Hold on, hold on!

15:14.414 --> 15:17.382
If no one's using that,
could we use it?

15:17.384 --> 15:20.551
They were like,
come on down to the horn.

15:20.553 --> 15:21.419
So they get to the horn.

15:21.421 --> 15:25.023
They're like, we are beautiful
scientists with lovely minds,

15:25.025 --> 15:28.092
And we want to listen
to the sounds between the stars.

15:28.094 --> 15:30.395
Boink.
They're like, let's go, babe!

15:30.397 --> 15:31.429
Let's listen up!
[laughs]

15:31.431 --> 15:34.799
Oh, god, I love thinking of them
calling each other "babe."

15:34.801 --> 15:38.169
So they listen,
and the sound

15:38.171 --> 15:39.804
Is a hundred times louder

15:39.806 --> 15:42.774
Than any sound
they expected to hear.

15:42.776 --> 15:46.911
It's like
[imitates static].

15:46.913 --> 15:49.447
The universe is like...
[imitates static]

15:49.449 --> 15:51.316
Find out about me!
[imitates static]

15:51.318 --> 15:52.650
So they were like,

15:52.652 --> 15:56.087
What is this darn sound?

15:56.089 --> 15:56.654
[laughs]

15:56.656 --> 15:59.691
It's coming from everywhere
in the sky at once.

15:59.693 --> 16:01.459
Everywhere, everywhere,
everywhere.

16:01.461 --> 16:02.260
[imitates static]

16:02.262 --> 16:03.194
And then they were like, no.

16:03.196 --> 16:05.663
There's no way a sound could
come from everywhere at once,

16:05.665 --> 16:07.799
So we have to eliminate
all the other sounds

16:07.801 --> 16:09.434
That might be,
like, interfering.

16:09.436 --> 16:13.504
So first they thought maybe--

16:14.206 --> 16:16.207
Someone doesn't care
about science.

16:16.209 --> 16:19.844
They were like, it must be
coming from, you know, new york.

16:19.846 --> 16:21.212
Urban interference, you know.

16:21.214 --> 16:22.914
New york is a city
with buildings and lights

16:22.916 --> 16:25.049
And people and subway
and blah, blah, blah.

16:25.051 --> 16:27.652
So they were like,
point it there.

16:27.654 --> 16:28.453
[hums]

16:28.455 --> 16:31.089
Pointed the horn
at new york city.

16:31.091 --> 16:33.091
No, that's not
what we were hearing.

16:33.093 --> 16:34.258
Forget about you, new york.

16:34.260 --> 16:37.295
Maybe it's coming
from a military base nearby.

16:37.297 --> 16:39.998
And then they just, like,
point it at the military bases,

16:40.000 --> 16:42.633
But they didn't hear that noise
coming from there.

16:42.635 --> 16:44.969
No, it isn't it.
[laughs]

16:44.971 --> 16:46.471
So then they were like,
okay, next.

16:46.473 --> 16:47.271
Maybe it's from the sun.

16:47.273 --> 16:49.040
They point it at the sun,
and the sun was like,

16:49.042 --> 16:51.676
I'm just the sun.
I don't give a [bleep].

16:51.678 --> 16:53.211
They were like,
it's not the sun.

16:53.213 --> 16:55.279
What the funk is this, man?

16:55.281 --> 16:57.415
And then they were like,
we should check our device.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.350
What if there's something
inside of this thing,

16:59.352 --> 17:02.653
Like, you know,
mold or a skeleton...

17:02.655 --> 17:05.423
Of a hobo that crawled in there
to get shelter?

17:05.425 --> 17:08.459
[laughing]
or whatever.

17:09.528 --> 17:11.729
They look inside the horn.
Guess what.

17:11.731 --> 17:14.699
This [bleep] thing
is filled with pigeons.

17:14.701 --> 17:20.204
Houston, we do have a problem,
and it's pigeons.

17:20.206 --> 17:21.939
[both laugh]

17:21.941 --> 17:25.443
Arno is like,
you do it, robert.

17:25.445 --> 17:26.477
You [bleep] kill them.

17:26.479 --> 17:29.647
Robert's like,
I don't want to do it.

17:29.649 --> 17:31.182
You do it.

17:31.184 --> 17:32.583
[laughs]

17:32.585 --> 17:34.052
Guess what they did.

17:34.054 --> 17:36.087
They shot them with a gun.

17:36.089 --> 17:36.754
A shotgun.

17:36.756 --> 17:38.756
Then they were like,
well, that'll do it.

17:38.758 --> 17:39.390
[chuckles]

17:39.392 --> 17:40.925
After they've wiped
the bird blood

17:40.927 --> 17:41.759
Off of their hands,

17:41.761 --> 17:44.529
They're both like,
r.I.P. These pigeons.

17:44.531 --> 17:45.329
Let's do this.

17:45.331 --> 17:48.332
Boink.
They start to listen.

17:48.334 --> 17:49.867
They're like, oh, [bleep].

17:49.869 --> 17:51.202
[imitates static]

17:51.204 --> 17:52.236
They hear it again.

17:52.238 --> 17:55.873
What the hunk is this
right now?

17:55.875 --> 17:57.141
[both laugh]

17:57.143 --> 17:59.610
They don't have the answer.

17:59.612 --> 18:00.945
They don't know what to do.

18:00.947 --> 18:03.614
They listen through the horn
for years.

18:03.616 --> 18:05.016
They're going
through their papers,

18:05.018 --> 18:06.250
Their papers, their papers.

18:06.252 --> 18:08.653
Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh,
I can't get it.

18:08.655 --> 18:10.855
Ugh, ugh,
there's nothing here.

18:10.857 --> 18:12.290
Ugh.
This one's boring.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.058
Ugh, this is
in another language.

18:14.060 --> 18:16.794
Just being like, we're never
gonna figure this out.

18:16.796 --> 18:20.998
Finally, they find a study
done by a scientist

18:21.000 --> 18:22.366
Whose name is dicke.

18:22.368 --> 18:22.934
[chuckles]

18:22.936 --> 18:25.470
He had this crackpot theory
that the universe,

18:25.472 --> 18:29.540
Instead of being infinite,
actually started at some point.

18:29.542 --> 18:34.145
Dicke's like,
13.8 billion years ago,

18:34.147 --> 18:36.314
Aka old as [bleep].

18:36.316 --> 18:37.148
[laughs]

18:37.150 --> 18:38.082
Check your watch.

18:38.084 --> 18:39.150
I think the universe started

18:39.152 --> 18:43.387
With, like, a crazy explosion,
aka the big bang.

18:43.389 --> 18:44.722
But they had no way to prove it.

18:44.724 --> 18:46.557
Then these two guys
from new jersey

18:46.559 --> 18:50.027
Who have been listening to this
[bleep] pigeon [bleep] horn...

18:50.029 --> 18:51.095
[laughs]

18:51.097 --> 18:53.865
Call him up, they're like,
we hear this thing.

18:53.867 --> 18:55.032
It's like
[imitates static].

18:55.034 --> 18:56.667
Have you ever heard of that
before?

18:56.669 --> 18:58.569
He's like, oh, my god.

18:58.571 --> 18:59.170
That's it.

18:59.172 --> 19:00.972
This is
what we've been studying.
