19:11.200 --> 19:12.844
Uh, could you watch
the counter, please?

19:12.894 --> 19:13.894
Yeah.

19:14.275 --> 19:15.860
Ain't it wrong to have
such a young girl

19:15.910 --> 19:17.320
employed by the neighborhood?

19:17.370 --> 19:18.430
Ah, she's adopted.

19:19.144 --> 19:20.750
Yeah, she's half Korean,
half Black.

19:21.100 --> 19:23.522
I'm being held here

19:30.500 --> 19:31.620
Uh, hold up.

19:31.670 --> 19:33.390
This is with the sale

Yeah.

19:34.253 --> 19:35.253
This don't add up.

19:35.903 --> 19:37.134
It does add up.

19:37.484 --> 19:38.875
There's taxes on these things.

19:39.325 --> 19:40.860
That's false advertising.

19:40.910 --> 19:42.293
Listen...

19:42.878 --> 19:44.753
Taxes don't go to me, okay?

19:44.804 --> 19:45.910
The taxes go
to the government.

19:45.960 --> 19:47.130
We all gotta pay that stuff.

19:47.180 --> 19:48.630
You people always
tryin' to rip us off.

19:48.680 --> 19:49.620
"You people"?

19:49.670 --> 19:51.784
Bitch, you act like you ever
heard of fuckin' taxes before?

19:51.834 --> 19:53.273
- Oh, hell no!
- No, no, fuck it!

19:53.323 --> 19:54.600

19:54.650 --> 19:55.931

- Hold on, ma'am.

19:55.981 --> 19:57.070
No, let her go, fuck it.

19:57.983 --> 19:59.354
The fuck do you mean,
let her go?

19:59.404 --> 20:00.620
<i>She wasn't gonna
buy shit anyway, fuck it.</i>

20:00.970 --> 20:02.150
<i>Does that matter?</i>

20:02.200 --> 20:04.100
Yo, you ever heard of
"the customer's always right"?

20:04.150 --> 20:05.440
Dawg, she's acting like she's
never heard of taxes before.

20:05.490 --> 20:06.790
What am I supposed
to do with that?

20:06.840 --> 20:08.052
Who the fuck cares, man?

20:08.402 --> 20:09.832
Yo, next time,
just keep your mouth shut

20:09.882 --> 20:11.205

20:12.086 --> 20:14.030
I'm not doing anything different

20:14.080 --> 20:15.080

- Yeah.

20:15.130 --> 20:17.350
Dad pissed of half the
customers who came in here.

20:21.702 --> 20:22.930
Where is he?

20:30.080 --> 20:31.220
<i>Where is he?</i>

20:37.865 --> 20:38.710
Kamilla.

20:38.760 --> 20:40.160
- Huh?
<i>- You hungry?</i>

20:40.210 --> 20:41.210
Yeah.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.086
Help her.

20:50.442 --> 20:53.022
<i>I thought police was supposed
to protect us, you know?</i>

20:53.072 --> 20:56.140
<i>Um, you know, I feel even
if he did something wrong,</i>

20:56.190 --> 20:57.676
<i>you know, he didn't...</i>

20:57.726 --> 20:58.726
<i>What do you wanna eat?</i>

20:58.876 --> 21:00.030
I don't know.

21:00.080 --> 21:01.600
Maybe a...

21:02.050 --> 21:04.184

21:04.234 --> 21:05.234
Chicken salad?

21:05.284 --> 21:06.482
Or chicken nug...

21:07.032 --> 21:08.502
Oh, shit.

21:18.252 --> 21:19.552
Who'd do this?

21:35.702 --> 21:36.683
Fuck.

21:47.733 --> 21:48.630
What up?

21:48.680 --> 21:51.672
Ha! you quit that job yet, man?

21:51.722 --> 21:53.200
Nah, nigga, I'm 'bout

Man, I don't care if he sees me.

22:50.205 --> 22:50.863
Oh.

You little smart ass.

22:54.545 --> 22:56.563
Why are you always hangin'
around our place, anyway?

22:56.613 --> 22:59.951
Why not? I mean,
who'll protect you guys?

23:00.101 --> 23:01.160
What do you mean?

23:01.838 --> 23:03.435
No one in this
neighborhood likes you.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.097
Ah, that's true.

23:05.547 --> 23:06.770
They're all like,

23:06.820 --> 23:08.480

No, no, no, no.

01:10:12.072 --> 01:10:13.044
I'm singin' about love.

01:10:13.394 --> 01:10:14.600
- Love?
- Love.

01:10:14.650 --> 01:10:16.060
The fuck do you know
about love?

01:10:16.634 --> 01:10:18.800
You know, I'm not,
I'm not as young as you...

01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:27.500

01:10:41.444 --> 01:10:42.780
Wait, wait, wait, slow down.

He's trying to get the shoes!

01:10:50.313 --> 01:10:53.210
Fuckin' me, Keith, man. Hell no,
Man, fuck this, dude.

01:11:04.350 --> 01:11:05.774
You think
I did this shit to myself?

01:11:05.824 --> 01:11:07.305
Keith and his boys beat
my ass in broad day.

01:11:07.355 --> 01:11:08.700
What the fuck do you
think he's gonna do

01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:09.550
- without the fucking cops around?
- Yo, yo, yo...

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:11.650
If we give him the shoes,
we lose the fucking store, man!

01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:12.914
Yo, fuck that store, dawg.

01:11:12.964 --> 01:11:14.390
Better that store

01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:16.860
Do you have any idea how much
Dad sacrificed for this place?

01:11:16.910 --> 01:11:18.870
- Fuck it. Move on.
- No, no, no, hold on, hold on.

01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:19.820
Hey, just help me
get 'em out.

01:11:19.870 --> 01:11:21.300
We'll fuckin' leave.
I promise, dude.

01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:23.010

Yo, you fucking selfish

You motherfuck!
Fuck you!

01:11:29.821 --> 01:11:30.924

Stop! Please, just stop!

All right, go, man. Fuck it.
I'll do this shit myself.

Kamilla, let's go.

You ain't sayin'

- Lucky we don't kill you, ese.
- Put that shit in the car.

01:12:57.637 --> 01:12:58.970
Put that shit in the car, homes.

01:13:00.307 --> 01:13:03.150
Hey, man, you shouldn't be
out here at night, ese.

01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:04.630
It's dangerous.

01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:06.110
Chavalla.

01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:09.010
<i>I should just

01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:10.411
<i>Little punk.</i>

01:13:12.380 --> 01:13:13.530
Little sissy.

Let's get outta here, homes.

01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:51.930
Should we go back?

01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:53.850
No.

01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:56.340
But Eli's family.

01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:18.350
It's Eli.

01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:41.272
- Hey.

01:15:09.722 --> 01:15:11.273
Yo, is that Jesus?

01:15:12.623 --> 01:15:13.675
Jesus!

01:15:16.114 --> 01:15:19.780

01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:21.015
What?

01:15:21.065 --> 01:15:22.574
Gasolina, over fence.

Yo, you got some gas?

01:15:24.181 --> 01:15:25.060

01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:41.580
Zapatos, shoes.

See what's in there.
Fuckin' tennis shoes, homie.

01:15:45.274 --> 01:15:47.188

Yo, I think Jesus said
the shoes are on the roof.

01:16:05.652 --> 01:16:07.200
Yo, if you're thinkin' about gettin'

I dunno, like 200 bucks.

01:16:12.723 --> 01:16:13.723

Get the fuck in the car!

Yo, if you don't

01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:21.260
Shut the fuck up.

01:16:54.700 --> 01:16:56.153
All right, hurry up.
Hurry up, come on.

Yo, you lie!
