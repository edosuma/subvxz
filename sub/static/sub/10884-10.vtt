00:01.328 --> 00:03.922
Said Kirsten was smart, but who knew.

00:03.947 --> 00:05.095
Yeah, who knew.

00:05.120 --> 00:06.648
Ivy, it's so nice to meet you.

00:06.673 --> 00:09.253
You can help me save our
father or you can go.

00:09.278 --> 00:12.937
<i>My test results came back. They are
not what we had hoped for, Linus.</i>

00:12.962 --> 00:15.437
Give me a swashbuckling
scientist any day.

00:15.637 --> 00:18.046
You used to wear your wedding band,
but you haven't since the hospital.

00:18.071 --> 00:20.723
It's time to move on. Thanks for
getting me off my ass in the hospital.

00:20.748 --> 00:23.611
Golly, don't go all
weepy on me now, Fisher.

00:23.636 --> 00:26.372
Kirsten: <i>My father stitching
me into my mother killed her.</i>

00:26.397 --> 00:28.145
- What's your name?
- Kirsten.

00:28.170 --> 00:29.005
I'm Cameron.

00:29.030 --> 00:31.072
You had no authority to
ditch your security detail.

00:31.097 --> 00:32.545
(scoffs) Actually...

00:33.132 --> 00:35.082
this says, I do.

00:35.107 --> 00:37.720
Someone's going to visit you to
ask a very specific question.

00:37.745 --> 00:39.908
Your answer will show if
you're ready to hear the truth.

00:39.933 --> 00:40.730
Will you marry me?

00:40.755 --> 00:42.331
She turned me down. What's plan B?

00:42.356 --> 00:43.824
- Camille?
- Liam?

00:43.849 --> 00:45.901
Liam believes my joining
his gym was a coincidence.

00:45.926 --> 00:47.775
I need to find out what his role is.

00:47.800 --> 00:49.835
How far do I go with this?

00:50.438 --> 00:51.811
Liam!

00:54.629 --> 00:55.820
(knocking on door)

00:55.845 --> 00:56.864
Come in.

00:58.786 --> 01:00.675
How did you get in here?

01:00.700 --> 01:02.015
Good morning to you, too.

01:02.040 --> 01:05.480
- Camille let me in.
- I didn't know she was still home.

01:05.506 --> 01:07.159
She is.

01:07.381 --> 01:11.280
And she's worried
about you, and so am I.

01:11.305 --> 01:12.354
Spare me the lecture, okay?

01:12.379 --> 01:14.675
I'm not here to lecture you
about your crazy walls and...

01:14.700 --> 01:16.735
That wasn't a lecture,
that was passive-aggressive.

01:16.760 --> 01:19.732
But I'm just here to make sure that you're
doing okay after what happened to Liam.

01:19.757 --> 01:21.827
Seriously, though,
how are you coping with it?

01:22.248 --> 01:24.384
- I'm fine.
- Hmm.

01:24.409 --> 01:26.784
Aside from the best chance
I have of finding my father,

01:26.809 --> 01:27.943
or taking a bullet to the brain.

01:27.968 --> 01:30.400
God, that's a little
cold, don't you think?

01:30.573 --> 01:33.059
What the hell was my father mixed up in?

01:33.084 --> 01:35.045
Have you spoken to Ivy again?

01:37.232 --> 01:39.372
No, I don't want to bring her into this.

01:40.216 --> 01:42.235
Especially after what happened to Liam.

01:42.260 --> 01:43.905
You should see her again.

01:43.930 --> 01:45.810
I don't know, maybe she can help you
if you make it more about getting

01:45.835 --> 01:47.582
to know your sister and less
about finding your father.

01:47.607 --> 01:49.436
Everything is about finding my father.

01:49.461 --> 01:52.471
I don't want her getting hurt, so I'm
gonna figure out where Stinger's hiding

01:52.496 --> 01:54.326
without dragging her anywhere into it.

01:54.351 --> 01:55.510
Okay, well,
I hope you figure it out and soon,

01:55.535 --> 01:57.366
'cause you're getting
lost in this obsession.

01:57.391 --> 01:59.687
And yes, I've said that before,
and yes, that was a lecture.

01:59.713 --> 02:02.199
That's why I need to find
my father as soon as I can.

02:03.096 --> 02:06.023
Before I get so lost I
can't find my way out.

Hey, yo, is everything okay?

02:52.749 --> 02:57.714
Well... My dad's got a fifty-fifty
chance of pulling through,

02:57.739 --> 03:00.105
so, other than that, I'm good.

03:00.130 --> 03:02.105
- Look, if you have to leave...
- No, no.

03:02.130 --> 03:03.888

03:03.913 --> 03:06.368
Good. 'Cause this is where
I need you to be, too.

03:06.393 --> 03:08.125
Feels like we're on a collision
course with something,

03:08.150 --> 03:10.413
and I don't want to go through
it without my Samwise Gamgee.

03:11.146 --> 03:13.025
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah. Anytime.

03:13.050 --> 03:16.721
But... we agreed that you're
Samwise and I'm Frodo, remember?

03:16.747 --> 03:18.075
Never agreed to that.

03:18.100 --> 03:21.991
For being a neuroscientist,
you have the absolute worst memory.

03:23.470 --> 03:26.919
Hey, tough guy,
we're almost ready to stitch.

03:26.944 --> 03:30.229
Yeah, I think I'm going
to sit this one out.

03:31.681 --> 03:33.550
Because of Liam?

03:33.575 --> 03:35.754
Yeah, because I could've
saved him and I didn't.

03:35.779 --> 03:37.088
Your job was to gather information...

03:37.113 --> 03:39.839
- My job wasn't to get him killed.
- But it happened.

03:39.864 --> 03:43.123
And sometimes, that is the job.

03:44.287 --> 03:46.541
I know, you're trying to...

03:46.995 --> 03:52.015
"blunt instrument"
my brain into accepting my negligence,

03:52.040 --> 03:57.872
but I kind of just need to feel this
pain for a little while and figure out

03:57.897 --> 04:03.372
if I'm even cut out for this line
of work, so, if you could go.

04:08.455 --> 04:10.582
Tell me what you could've
done differently.

04:10.607 --> 04:15.035
Okay. I could've warned Liam that people
who hang out with Stinger often become dead

04:15.060 --> 04:16.704
and he might be next.

04:17.666 --> 04:20.197
Instead, I made out with him.

04:23.585 --> 04:28.464
I can't... I can't do it.
I can't look at another person I know

04:28.489 --> 04:30.099
in that corpse cassette

04:30.124 --> 04:32.607
and not think about how I
should've done something.

04:32.632 --> 04:34.732
I'm not strong enough.

04:35.112 --> 04:36.817
Yes, you are.

04:38.499 --> 04:41.586
And I know this because I wouldn't have
spent all the time with you that I have.

04:41.610 --> 04:43.228
Oh, lay off, Fisher, please.

04:43.253 --> 04:46.121
You didn't lay off of
me when I got shot.

04:46.147 --> 04:47.601
So what is this? My punishment?

04:47.625 --> 04:51.298
No. This is "thank you."

04:56.604 --> 04:58.182
Lights at 20%, please.

04:58.696 --> 05:01.232
So, the trajectory of the
bullet went through the area

05:01.257 --> 05:03.216
of Liam's brain where his
working memories are stored.

05:03.241 --> 05:05.242
So, I'm not sure how much
we can reliably retrieve,

05:05.267 --> 05:06.372
so everyone stay sharp.

05:06.397 --> 05:08.397
I need a go, no-go for stitch neurosync.
Life-Sci?

05:08.422 --> 05:08.974
Go.

05:08.999 --> 05:09.831
- Sub-Bio.
- Go.

05:09.855 --> 05:10.989
- Engineering.
- Go.

05:11.014 --> 05:12.366
- Medical.
- Go.

05:12.391 --> 05:14.075
- Communications.
- Frodo is go.

05:14.100 --> 05:15.250
I'm gonna let that one slide.

05:15.275 --> 05:17.935
Comm check, Kirsten. One-two, one-two.
Are you sure you're okay to do this?

05:17.960 --> 05:19.287
Whatever gets me to the truth.

05:19.312 --> 05:21.380
Okay. Induce stitch
neurosync on my mark.

05:21.405 --> 05:24.286
In three, two, one... mark!

05:33.519 --> 05:35.458
Oh, wow.

05:35.483 --> 05:36.561
Do you see Stinger?

05:36.586 --> 05:39.742
No, I see Liam when we
first met at school.

05:40.132 --> 05:42.571
Liam: <i>Advanced Statistics
in Information Theory.</i>

05:44.428 --> 05:46.615
That's going to take
some time to get through.

05:46.640 --> 05:48.371
That makes no sense.
Everything takes time.

05:48.396 --> 05:50.139
I was just making small talk.

05:50.163 --> 05:51.767
Let's make no talk.

05:51.792 --> 05:53.894
God!
Did I really used to sound like a robot?

05:53.919 --> 05:56.566
- No.
- You sounded like an angry robot.

05:56.591 --> 05:58.925
Wait, I'm being pulled.

05:59.917 --> 06:02.636
Guys,
I think I found the path of the bullet.

06:07.849 --> 06:10.817
_

06:10.842 --> 06:11.912
Excuse me.

06:21.055 --> 06:22.919
Stupid accent, works every time.

06:22.944 --> 06:24.982
Mapping a memory hot spot.

06:25.007 --> 06:27.379
Hold on, C3PO. You're on the move.

06:33.161 --> 06:34.809
I hear buzzing.

06:34.835 --> 06:35.818
What kind of buzzing?

06:35.843 --> 06:36.838
What kind?

06:36.862 --> 06:39.264
- Electrical.
- Interference maybe?

06:39.289 --> 06:40.195
It's not us.

06:40.220 --> 06:42.112
Well, it could be damage
to Liam's brain, Kirsten.

06:42.137 --> 06:44.306
I don't know, it sounds like
it's coming from overhead.

06:44.331 --> 06:46.919
Stinger: I want to know everything
there is about my daughter.

06:46.944 --> 06:49.725
Who she calls, who she emails,
and if anyone approaches her.

06:49.750 --> 06:51.349
Liam: Kirsten will feel
like I'm smothering her.

06:51.374 --> 06:53.781
Stinger: No, she won't.
That's a time-based emotion.

06:53.806 --> 06:55.922
Just keep using that
phony British accent.

06:55.947 --> 06:57.126
Stinger: <i>Girls love it.</i>

06:57.151 --> 06:59.416
Liam wasn't British. He faked it.

06:59.441 --> 07:01.377
- Is that a joke?
- I wish.

07:05.153 --> 07:08.066
Of course there is a way I can
be close to her all the time.

07:08.091 --> 07:09.713
I could marry her.

07:10.267 --> 07:12.166
We have chemistry,

07:12.191 --> 07:14.214
at least enough for
me to close the deal.

07:14.239 --> 07:17.615
Stinger: What if Kirsten
doesn't accept your proposal?

07:17.639 --> 07:19.988
Liam: Then I'll stay in LA.

07:20.013 --> 07:22.787
Circle around,
work my way back into her life.

07:22.845 --> 07:26.711
Maybe get to Kirsten through
that roommate of hers.

07:28.108 --> 07:30.077
You okay?

07:30.102 --> 07:31.653
Yeah.

07:32.305 --> 07:33.725
Get me out of here!

07:33.750 --> 07:34.825
I've got something
near the death memory.

07:34.858 --> 07:36.444
All I got left is the death memory.

07:36.468 --> 07:38.378
Anything is better than this.

07:39.288 --> 07:41.341
Liam's waiting for me in the alley.

07:41.613 --> 07:44.405
Kirsten? Where are you?

07:44.430 --> 07:47.680
Yeah, I'm just around the corner.
Stay where you are, I'll come to you.

07:49.693 --> 07:51.284
Wait, no!

07:51.309 --> 07:53.416
I'm bouncing!

08:00.973 --> 08:02.812
Did you get a lead on Stinger?

08:02.837 --> 08:03.857
I'm not sure.

08:04.654 --> 08:07.083
That lying bastard got what he deserved.

08:28.981 --> 08:31.299
Hey, did you, uh...

08:32.106 --> 08:34.640
manage to get any sleep last night?

08:35.400 --> 08:37.280
Yeah, a little bit.

08:38.894 --> 08:40.783
Is everything okay?

08:40.808 --> 08:43.865
Every equation that
might help me is here.

08:44.434 --> 08:46.353
And it's still not enough.

08:46.378 --> 08:48.836
I can't figure it out.

08:48.861 --> 08:50.426
I've been...

08:51.136 --> 08:54.884
racking my brain, hoping that something
is going to just jump out of me,

08:54.909 --> 08:58.474
or that I'll...
that I'll make like some connection.

09:02.019 --> 09:04.054
Oh, my God! What a waste of time.

09:05.280 --> 09:07.447
Hey, hey, hey! Don't do that, I get it!

09:07.472 --> 09:08.744
You're frustrated, you're tired.

09:08.769 --> 09:10.743
I'm tired, I'm tired,
I'm tired and I'm done!

09:10.768 --> 09:13.434
If I'm so smart, how
could I be so stupid?

09:15.442 --> 09:18.469
Someone... Someone moved that string.

09:18.494 --> 09:20.128
Don't look at me.

09:20.153 --> 09:22.753
I don't come in your room when
you're gone. This creeps me out.

09:22.778 --> 09:24.018
Who else was in here?

09:25.070 --> 09:27.753
Um... Cameron... Nina...

09:28.172 --> 09:30.520
(sighs) Ivy.

09:30.646 --> 09:32.210
She could have done it.

09:32.235 --> 09:35.910
That's... That's the
equation for power lost

09:35.935 --> 09:37.705
during the transmission of electricity.

09:38.184 --> 09:40.906
I wanted to see how far a
power surge could travel.

09:40.931 --> 09:42.920
- Of course, you did.
- In the stitch,

09:42.945 --> 09:44.503
when Liam met with Stinger,

09:44.529 --> 09:47.608
I heard a distinct buzzing sound.
In the background,

09:47.633 --> 09:50.429
It sounded a lot like electricity,
a lot of it!

09:50.454 --> 09:52.263
Okay, uh, generator?

09:52.288 --> 09:54.884
Power lines? Substation?

09:57.177 --> 09:59.729
Monterey Park. Monterey Park.

09:59.754 --> 10:03.664
Why would anyone need his
own personal substation?

10:03.689 --> 10:08.178
There's only...
one DWP substation in the area.

10:08.507 --> 10:10.586
It's old, but it's not abandoned.

10:11.735 --> 10:12.894
He's there.

10:13.353 --> 10:16.831
Ivy couldn't come right out and tell me,
so she left me this message.

10:16.855 --> 10:18.236
Why?

10:18.261 --> 10:21.010
Because I told her that the
only way to protect Stinger...

10:21.035 --> 10:23.889
was for me to find him
before the NSA did.

10:23.914 --> 10:25.954
Is that true?

10:33.385 --> 10:35.444
Hey, handsome, what's cooking?

10:35.469 --> 10:38.821
Oh, it's the Goodkin breakfast sampler.
Don't get up, don't get up.

10:38.846 --> 10:40.439
Ah, it's too late.

10:40.464 --> 10:43.493
Okay, well, I hope you're hungry,
it's quite the feast.

10:55.200 --> 10:57.160
Is this for real?

11:01.215 --> 11:05.271
I'm a neuroscientist who works for
a classified crime unit at the NSA.

11:07.547 --> 11:09.687
Okay.

11:12.357 --> 11:14.858
You're not joking, are you?

11:15.391 --> 11:17.049
Oh.

11:18.190 --> 11:20.088
- Wow.
- Hey, hey.

11:20.113 --> 11:21.756
It's okay, I'm glad you found it,
in fact, I'm relieved.

11:21.781 --> 11:23.239
I hated keeping that secret from you.

11:23.264 --> 11:25.217
So, the whole working at
a video game company...

11:25.242 --> 11:26.761
Is a cover.

11:27.024 --> 11:29.248
And Kirsten?

11:29.273 --> 11:31.310
Is an NSA Agent, yeah.

11:31.503 --> 11:34.702
She's a critical asset to the team.
It's my job to keep her safe.

11:34.727 --> 11:36.746
That's how we got to be so close.

11:36.771 --> 11:38.462
Right.

11:39.720 --> 11:44.750
Well, this is not at all how I
was expecting this morning to go.

11:44.775 --> 11:46.058
Look, I'm done with the secrets.

11:46.083 --> 11:48.343
Okay? So is there any
chance, any chance at all

11:48.368 --> 11:51.348
that we can just move forward together,
now that you know the truth?

11:55.018 --> 11:57.745
I guess I got what I always wanted.

11:58.146 --> 12:01.545
My own swashbuckling scientist.

12:03.540 --> 12:08.480
(electricity crackling)

12:21.318 --> 12:22.543
(buzzes)

12:29.073 --> 12:30.279
Ivy?

12:30.304 --> 12:31.609
You screwed this up.

12:31.634 --> 12:33.821
You ruined everything.

12:33.846 --> 12:36.081
I followed the clue you left for me.

12:36.106 --> 12:38.786
So you could finally meet our father?

12:38.811 --> 12:41.178
So you could save him,
like you told me you would.

12:41.203 --> 12:42.848
- Where is he?
- Gone!

12:42.873 --> 12:44.801
Again.

12:48.610 --> 12:52.045
This time, he left both of us.

12:52.829 --> 12:54.897
He cleared out everything
he was working on.

12:55.011 --> 12:57.215
So, you knew what he was working on,
after all?

12:57.240 --> 12:59.800
I never lied to you.

12:59.825 --> 13:04.378
I knew he was working on something big,
but what it did, I don't know.

13:04.403 --> 13:09.093
And even if I knew, do you really
think I'd tell you anything anymore?

13:11.209 --> 13:16.020
I shared information with you
that I promised to keep secret.

13:17.270 --> 13:20.259
You got me to betray my own father.

13:20.284 --> 13:22.154
I'm sorry.

13:22.940 --> 13:24.104
Daniel Stinger is...

13:24.129 --> 13:25.788
Is my father!

13:25.813 --> 13:27.101
Then why did he leave?

13:27.126 --> 13:28.953
He knew you were coming.

13:28.979 --> 13:30.403
I thought he wanted me to.

13:30.427 --> 13:32.207
He knew you weren't coming alone.

13:32.232 --> 13:32.732
(door breaks open)

13:32.757 --> 13:34.000
Man 1: NSA freeze!

13:34.025 --> 13:36.534
Man 2: Spread out, check every room.

13:36.559 --> 13:38.407
- Clear!
- Clear!

13:38.432 --> 13:40.406
Clear!

13:41.030 --> 13:43.335
Kirsten, where is he?

13:43.360 --> 13:45.998
Not here. Someone tipped him off.

13:46.260 --> 13:48.239
- Her?
- No.

13:48.264 --> 13:50.776
He must be connected to
someone inside the NSA.

13:50.801 --> 13:53.810
How were you able to
lie to me so completely?

13:53.835 --> 13:55.684
I didn't!

13:55.709 --> 13:57.902
I never said that I wasn't
going to bring him in.

13:57.927 --> 13:59.405
He's considered armed and dangerous.

13:59.430 --> 14:01.869
If the NSA find him
out there without me...

14:01.893 --> 14:03.416
they won't hesitate to shoot.

14:03.442 --> 14:06.415
I could have protected him.

14:06.439 --> 14:08.773
You know what this
looks like, don't you?

14:08.798 --> 14:10.878
Yes, that explains the power plant.

14:10.904 --> 14:13.027
Ivy Brown, I'm Maggie
Baptiste with the NSA.

14:13.051 --> 14:15.329
I'd like to ask you a few
questions about your father.

14:15.354 --> 14:17.365
Would you mind coming with me?

14:18.844 --> 14:22.016
Anything to not be with her anymore.

14:23.023 --> 14:26.526
Wait. I almost forgot.

14:27.480 --> 14:29.449
My father said to tell you

14:29.474 --> 14:32.072
not to waste tears on Ed Clark.

14:32.097 --> 14:35.119
He kept some very important
information from you.

14:35.145 --> 14:37.105
Ed told me everything he could.
Even after he died,

14:37.130 --> 14:39.288
he made sure to leave clues behind,
so that I'd know the truth.

14:39.312 --> 14:40.917
Not all of it.

14:40.942 --> 14:44.037
Not this.

14:45.096 --> 14:47.817
Your mother...

14:47.842 --> 14:52.576
is still alive.

15:14.551 --> 15:15.959
Is my mother dead?

15:15.984 --> 15:17.953
My door was closed for a reason.

15:17.978 --> 15:19.645
It's a simple question. Yes or no?

15:19.670 --> 15:23.365
You are not the only one with
issues at the moment, so back off!

15:23.777 --> 15:25.099
What's going on?

15:25.124 --> 15:28.578
Unlike you,
I don't drag everyone into my problems.

15:29.383 --> 15:31.660
Sorry.

15:39.914 --> 15:44.783
I've checked hospital records,
birth records, death certificates,

15:44.808 --> 15:47.611
even the damn US Census,
and nothing, it's like...

15:47.636 --> 15:50.635
my mother never existed.
There's no record of her anywhere.

15:50.660 --> 15:51.968
Of course not.

15:51.994 --> 15:54.331
And you won't find
anything on me, either.

15:54.355 --> 15:56.244
Or Blair, or Turner, or Stinger.

15:56.269 --> 15:58.451
And if you stick with the
program long enough...

15:58.476 --> 16:00.042
you'll be gone, too.

16:00.067 --> 16:01.453
Is that what's gonna happen to Ivy?

16:01.478 --> 16:04.991
No. She is being questioned
and then she will be released.

16:06.012 --> 16:07.862
I'd like to talk to her.

16:08.579 --> 16:10.528
She doesn't want to talk to you.

16:10.553 --> 16:12.419
Guess I can't blame her.

16:13.823 --> 16:15.742
How involved was she with Stinger?

16:15.767 --> 16:17.325
He reached out to her six months ago,

16:17.350 --> 16:19.459
but she never knew that
he was wanted for murder.

16:19.484 --> 16:22.777
She believed that he was working
on some top secret technology

16:22.809 --> 16:25.073
but didn't know what it was for.

16:25.745 --> 16:28.624
I think she was being groomed.

16:28.649 --> 16:29.636
For what?

16:29.661 --> 16:32.690
The family business, stitching.

16:32.709 --> 16:35.128
We're going to keep a close
eye on her to see if Stinger

16:35.153 --> 16:36.490
reestablishes contact,

16:36.515 --> 16:39.960
but I know that he won't.

16:39.985 --> 16:41.810
He's gone.

16:42.146 --> 16:45.225
Ivy said my mother was still alive.

16:45.508 --> 16:47.348
Is she right?

16:47.373 --> 16:50.332
(sighs)

16:50.357 --> 16:53.435
Until today, I would have told you no.

16:54.342 --> 16:56.261
Now, I don't know.

16:56.286 --> 17:00.383
So, if she's not dead,
who's buried in her crypt?

17:01.891 --> 17:05.093
Neither I nor the NSA can
be involved in any of this.

17:05.117 --> 17:09.378
Therefore, I have a legal
and professional obligation

17:09.404 --> 17:13.311
to insist, that you
do not call Fisher...

17:14.106 --> 17:18.359
and ask him to reach out to
the district attorney's office.

17:26.848 --> 17:29.695
Exhumation order for Jacqueline Stinger.

17:29.720 --> 17:31.230
Well, that was fast.

17:31.255 --> 17:33.646
I pulled in a favor from Judge Harvale.

17:34.559 --> 17:36.421
What's with the suit jacket?

17:36.446 --> 17:38.266
I thought you hated them.

17:38.994 --> 17:40.576
Used to.

17:42.855 --> 17:45.714
- Do you want to...
- Yeah.

17:51.085 --> 17:54.600
You know, after you got shot,
I visited you in the hospital.

17:54.626 --> 17:56.765
- But you were sleeping.
- Could have woken me up.

17:56.790 --> 17:58.719
I didn't know if you
really wanted to see me.

17:58.744 --> 18:00.838
I think it would have been okay.

18:02.821 --> 18:05.687
You're not wearing your
wedding ring anymore.

18:08.542 --> 18:10.985
Yeah, my hand didn't feel right with it.

18:14.143 --> 18:16.222
Thank you for this stuff.

18:16.989 --> 18:19.329
- I hope it wasn't awkward when I called.
- No.

18:19.354 --> 18:22.287
I've been meaning to call you, actually.
I just...

18:22.313 --> 18:25.123
I didn't know if I should, and...

18:28.374 --> 18:31.447
- I've been doing some thinking.
- Always thinking.

18:33.223 --> 18:34.924
That's what I loved about you.

18:34.949 --> 18:36.479
Could you?

18:37.379 --> 18:39.864
Again? Love me?

18:39.889 --> 18:41.435
I never stopped.

18:41.460 --> 18:43.777
What would it take to
give it another try?

18:45.500 --> 18:47.489
You want to give us another try?

18:47.514 --> 18:49.189
(sighs)

18:49.213 --> 18:51.252
(phone ringing)

18:51.277 --> 18:53.096
- It's okay.
- No, no, no, no.

18:53.121 --> 18:55.529
No, it's okay. I have
to be at, um, court,

18:55.554 --> 18:58.503
but we'll talk later.

18:58.629 --> 19:00.120
Absolutely.

19:03.595 --> 19:06.602
My hand didn't feel right without it.

19:11.112 --> 19:14.007
(phone ringing)

19:15.485 --> 19:16.994
Yeah, Kirsten.

19:17.019 --> 19:18.958
My friend came through.

19:18.983 --> 19:20.883
I have the exhumation order.

19:38.744 --> 19:40.614
Steady.

19:45.269 --> 19:47.228
You sure about this?

19:49.669 --> 19:50.719
Okay.

20:19.732 --> 20:21.681
Got your message.

20:21.706 --> 20:24.534
You wanted to talk, let's talk.

20:27.997 --> 20:30.363
Oh, yes, I see.

20:30.584 --> 20:33.783
You, too, have a flair for the dramatic,

20:33.808 --> 20:35.675
Ms. Clark. I like that.

20:35.700 --> 20:38.029
Tell me about Jacqueline Stinger.

20:38.054 --> 20:39.222
What about her?

20:40.537 --> 20:41.819
Where is she?

20:41.844 --> 20:43.803
Dead and buried, last I heard.

20:43.828 --> 20:44.987
I'm going to ask you one more time,

20:45.012 --> 20:47.219
and if I don't get a real answer,

20:47.244 --> 20:49.724
I'm leaving the Stitchers program.

20:49.749 --> 20:52.617
The confidence you have
in your position here...

20:53.120 --> 20:56.321
- it's naive at best.
- Where is she?

20:56.346 --> 20:58.729
I know she's not dead.
Her coffin is empty!

20:58.754 --> 21:01.676
Well, an empty coffin does
not a live person make.

21:01.806 --> 21:07.116
And now, if you'll excuse me, the lovely
Mrs. Blair is waiting for me in the limo.

21:07.512 --> 21:10.381
That's not good enough for me!

21:10.406 --> 21:12.247
What do you imagine you can do

21:12.272 --> 21:15.209
to find out more? Kill me?

21:15.234 --> 21:16.991
A deputy chief of the NSA?

21:17.016 --> 21:18.465
How is that going to work out for you?

21:18.490 --> 21:21.599
You have no power, Ms. Clark.

21:21.624 --> 21:24.823
You have no future beyond what
I'm willing to let you have.

21:24.848 --> 21:27.692
So, you be very, very careful

21:27.718 --> 21:30.539
because I own you and
I do not allow myself

21:30.564 --> 21:33.694
to be threatened by my possessions!

21:51.930 --> 21:54.538
(phone ringing)

21:55.365 --> 21:58.314
- What's up?
- I just wanted to, you know...

21:58.339 --> 22:02.287
to say... I just wanted to thank
you for yesterday, for our talk,

22:02.312 --> 22:03.579
<i>in the lab.</i>

22:03.604 --> 22:05.143
No problem.

22:05.167 --> 22:07.294
I enjoy hearing you whine
about yourself, though.

22:07.319 --> 22:09.573
(chuckles) Well...

22:09.597 --> 22:10.876
in that case, you wanna come over?

22:10.901 --> 22:14.157
I could do a little whining,
we can drink a little wine.

22:14.182 --> 22:15.004
Sorry, I can't.

22:15.029 --> 22:18.175
(scoffs) All right, fine.
More Chardonnay for me.

22:18.200 --> 22:19.543
<i>You sure?</i>

22:19.568 --> 22:21.372
I'm having dinner with my wife.

22:21.397 --> 22:23.443
Your wife? That's...

22:23.468 --> 22:25.902
Unexpected? Yeah.

22:25.927 --> 22:29.448
She came by the office today, asked if
I thought we could give another shot.

22:29.473 --> 22:32.108
Well, that's really... (clears throat)

22:32.133 --> 22:33.849
How do you...

22:33.875 --> 22:35.854
How do you feel? How are you feeling?

22:35.879 --> 22:37.890
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

22:37.914 --> 22:40.086
<i>We're talking it through tonight.</i>

22:41.546 --> 22:44.030
- You still there?
- Yeah, no, I'm just...

22:44.055 --> 22:46.423
(clears throat) That's... This is...

22:47.258 --> 22:49.516
For sure, this is amazing.

22:49.541 --> 22:51.903
<i>- Try not to eff it up this time.</i>
- Hey, it's me.

22:51.928 --> 22:54.525
- That's what I'm worried about.
<i>- Yeah, yeah.</i>

22:54.550 --> 22:55.887
Have a good night, tough guy.

22:55.913 --> 22:57.294
I'll let you know how it goes.

22:57.319 --> 22:59.303
Yeah, I can't wait to hear.

22:59.564 --> 23:00.604
Okay.

23:05.740 --> 23:08.013
I'm so stupid.

23:08.342 --> 23:09.967
(knocking on door)

23:10.741 --> 23:11.761
Hey.

23:12.464 --> 23:14.363
What's going on?

23:14.591 --> 23:16.092
I'm sorry, I...

23:16.632 --> 23:20.653
I feel like... I feel lost. I feel...

23:20.678 --> 23:22.477
trapped, I don't know.

23:22.502 --> 23:24.723
- What?
- God, I'm sorry. I'm just barging in.

23:24.748 --> 23:26.918
- Is Nina here? Is somebody here?
- No, no! It's fine, it's fine.

23:26.943 --> 23:28.082
Hey, Kirsten.

23:28.107 --> 23:30.904
I just really screwed
things up, didn't I?

23:30.929 --> 23:34.018
No, come here. Look, okay, Kirsten,
you've had a few setbacks,

23:34.043 --> 23:36.943
okay, but...
you're just being hard on yourself.

23:36.968 --> 23:39.142
You're smart, okay?
You're going to figure this out.

23:39.167 --> 23:40.823
I don't know that I want to anymore.

23:40.848 --> 23:44.256
Okay... Look at me, look at me.

23:46.167 --> 23:47.731
What do you want?

23:47.904 --> 23:50.865
I want to be with my mother.

23:52.288 --> 23:54.656
I want the childhood that I never had.

23:54.681 --> 23:56.710
They say you can't go home again.

23:57.207 --> 23:59.534
I know.

24:02.001 --> 24:03.758
I don't even remember

24:03.783 --> 24:06.862
ever being home in
the first place, ever.

24:09.844 --> 24:14.404
Except here, with you.
Here feels like home.

24:17.468 --> 24:20.152
Hey, come here, come here.

25:00.957 --> 25:04.261
I'm sorry. I'll go. I'm sorry.

25:07.098 --> 25:08.967
(door opens)

25:09.578 --> 25:11.467
(door closes)

25:16.891 --> 25:18.840
Oh, hey, Queen.

25:18.865 --> 25:20.794
Care for some Vino?

25:22.119 --> 25:25.397
This has been the worst
day of my adult life.

25:26.022 --> 25:28.369
Hence the "Care for some Vino?"

25:28.394 --> 25:30.476
No, thanks.

25:30.849 --> 25:34.570
My ability to make decisions
is already at an all-time low.

25:34.951 --> 25:36.803
Well, boo-frickin'-hoo.

25:36.828 --> 25:38.083
Excuse me?

25:38.108 --> 25:43.918
I said, boo-frickin'-hoo.

25:44.616 --> 25:46.437
What's gotten in to you?

25:46.462 --> 25:49.371
Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc.

25:49.396 --> 25:52.154
And a burrito, but that doesn't
mean I'm not in top shape

25:52.179 --> 25:53.966
to be the Watson to your Sherlock,

25:53.991 --> 25:55.779
or whatever. So hit me, what do you got?

25:55.804 --> 25:58.557
I don't know if my
mother is alive or dead.

25:58.582 --> 26:00.889
Cameron is with Nina.

26:00.914 --> 26:02.687
My sister hates me,

26:02.712 --> 26:04.996
my father's in the
wind, Maggie can't help.

26:05.022 --> 26:06.961
Blair is a psycho.

26:08.318 --> 26:09.741
I'm at rock bottom.

26:11.572 --> 26:18.702
Since when, do either of us, need
somebody else, when we've got each other?

26:18.727 --> 26:22.666
Why don't we do what we always
do when we have a problem

26:22.691 --> 26:25.691
and solve the crap out of it, together.

26:29.742 --> 26:31.419
Attagirl.

26:32.818 --> 26:36.474
Ivy said that Ed Clark
knew my mother was alive.

26:36.984 --> 26:38.983
I thought he told you everything.

26:39.008 --> 26:40.055
Apparently not.

26:40.080 --> 26:42.895
Unless he did and you
just didn't realize it.

26:45.391 --> 26:48.944
The last conversation I had with
him was months before he died.

26:48.969 --> 26:52.035
He told me that if anything
should happen to him,

26:52.060 --> 26:55.282
he wanted to be cremated and
his ashes put into that urn.

26:56.751 --> 26:58.670
- That urn?
- Mmm-hmm.

26:58.695 --> 27:01.567
So, he chose that urn for a reason.

27:05.142 --> 27:06.748
Look...

27:07.777 --> 27:10.128
- It's a pattern.
- Braille?

27:10.153 --> 27:11.973
Binary.

27:23.552 --> 27:25.430
Camille: Holy hell! It's an address.

27:25.455 --> 27:27.022
10816 Eastham Blvd.

27:27.047 --> 27:28.646
Wait, what's 2319?

27:28.671 --> 27:30.530
Five bucks says it's an entry code.

27:30.584 --> 27:32.568
Should we go see if you've
earned that five bucks?

27:32.593 --> 27:35.432
- All right, but we need backup.
- I thought we didn't need anyone.

27:35.457 --> 27:36.333
No, backup.

27:36.358 --> 27:37.842
I'll call a taxi.

27:45.023 --> 27:46.949
We have a winner.

27:53.662 --> 27:55.146
(door opens)

28:05.956 --> 28:06.966
(beeping)

28:09.701 --> 28:12.600
Camille: Um... Kirsten?

28:12.625 --> 28:15.767
I don't think I've had
enough backup in me for this.

28:17.796 --> 28:20.795
The blood is old. Whatever
happened, happened a long time ago.

28:20.820 --> 28:22.507
It's okay.

28:23.995 --> 28:26.614
"JAS6/13?"

28:26.639 --> 28:30.930
JAS is Jacqueline Adele Stinger.

28:30.955 --> 28:32.868
6/13 is her birthday.

28:32.893 --> 28:35.273
Same as mine.

28:46.598 --> 28:48.408
He's dead.

28:48.667 --> 28:51.402
Dr. Jean-Simone Khouri.

28:51.427 --> 28:53.251
- (gasps)
- (screams)

28:53.276 --> 28:55.997
Jacqueline Stinger. Where is she?

28:56.257 --> 28:59.148
JAS6/13. Who took her?

29:07.816 --> 29:09.811
Cameron: His name is
Dr. Jean-Simone Khouri.

29:09.836 --> 29:12.695
He helped develop NASA's
deep space sleep technology.

29:12.720 --> 29:14.175
It's how they kept my mother
alive all these years.

29:14.200 --> 29:17.684
May have kept her alive. We still
don't know what happened to her.

29:18.982 --> 29:20.660
What's up with Maggie?

29:20.685 --> 29:22.717
Something's going on, I'm not sure.

29:23.517 --> 29:27.419
Look, I am sorry,
about last night, at your place.

29:27.444 --> 29:28.949
Hey, don't worry about it.

29:28.974 --> 29:32.274
We hadn't been awkward with each other
in practically a whole afternoon.

29:32.995 --> 29:34.566
We were due.

29:34.591 --> 29:37.802
- Okay, I better change.
- Okay.

29:42.519 --> 29:43.628
Samir: You should go.

29:43.653 --> 29:45.508
Linus: I'm not leaving you.

29:45.533 --> 29:47.160
You should get back to work, Linus.

29:47.185 --> 29:51.492
Do you guys think I'm the only person at
the office who can program a video game?

29:54.639 --> 29:57.916
Your colleagues at the Stitch
lab are depending on you.

29:57.941 --> 30:01.349
(scoffs) "Stitch lab"? No, Baba.

30:01.374 --> 30:04.133
I work at a video game
company, remember?

30:04.158 --> 30:06.368
- Mom, tell him.
- We know what you really do.

30:06.394 --> 30:10.542
We have known,
since Ms. Baptiste and Mr. Turner

30:10.567 --> 30:12.726
first approached us when
you were in high school.

30:12.753 --> 30:14.370
Baba, this doesn't...

30:14.395 --> 30:17.153
They recognized your potential.

30:17.178 --> 30:22.993
They knew how valuable a brilliant young
man like you could be to their program.

30:23.018 --> 30:25.449
Which apparently isn't
as secret as I thought.

30:25.473 --> 30:27.669
(chuckles) It is.

30:27.798 --> 30:31.325
But your mother and I had clearance

30:31.350 --> 30:34.342
from when we were software
engineers for the government.

30:34.367 --> 30:36.319
So you've known this the whole time?

30:36.516 --> 30:40.407
Your work is very,
very important, Linus.

30:40.432 --> 30:44.379
You're helping to bring justice
to the most silent of victims.

30:44.405 --> 30:47.188
Linus, you're a Stitcher.

30:48.014 --> 30:50.058
You should have told me you knew.

30:50.650 --> 30:52.677
We are telling you now.

30:52.702 --> 30:54.253
Why?

30:54.682 --> 30:56.697
Because, Linus...

30:57.267 --> 30:59.788
if something should happen to me...

30:59.813 --> 31:01.107
Samir, stop it.

31:01.132 --> 31:03.719
Linus,
I want you to stitch into my memories...

31:03.744 --> 31:06.584
- Baba!
- So you could know...

31:07.274 --> 31:10.348
how I've always been proud of you.

31:11.732 --> 31:14.921
And how much I love you, Linus.

31:21.452 --> 31:24.800
I don't need to stitch to know that.

31:32.278 --> 31:34.238
Lights to 20%, please.

31:34.451 --> 31:37.270
I need a go, no-go for stitch neurosync.

31:37.295 --> 31:38.849
Blair: No go!

31:40.316 --> 31:41.979
What the hell do you think you're doing?

31:42.004 --> 31:44.477
Stitching, Mr. Blair, and the thing is,
I don't like outsiders

31:44.502 --> 31:47.231
- in here while I work. So...
- Get out of the tank.

31:47.256 --> 31:49.416
She has the right to know
the truth about her mother.

31:49.442 --> 31:52.702
She has no right to use
the resources of my lab.

31:52.727 --> 31:54.507
What are you so afraid we'll find?

31:55.430 --> 31:58.233
Baptiste, end this. Right now.

32:02.824 --> 32:05.875
Mission clock to five minutes.

32:07.869 --> 32:09.699
Okay, let's light this candle.

32:09.724 --> 32:12.987
- Goodkin!
- Sir, you can watch from over here...

32:13.012 --> 32:15.205
With Camille.

32:19.257 --> 32:21.136
Hey, there.

32:21.161 --> 32:24.941
Induce stitch neurosync on my mark.
In three, two, one.

32:24.966 --> 32:27.074
Mark!

32:29.991 --> 32:33.693
You're doing very well
today, Mrs. Stinger.

32:33.718 --> 32:36.841
I'm with Dr. Khouri outside
the hibernation chamber.

32:36.866 --> 32:38.635
Oh, it's nice of you to ask.

32:38.660 --> 32:40.724
My family is fine.

32:40.749 --> 32:43.380
Yes, I'm sure you do miss your family.

32:43.405 --> 32:45.697
Someday, Mrs. Stinger.

32:45.722 --> 32:49.655
He's talking to my mother, like he knows
her. He's pretending to talk to her.

32:49.679 --> 32:50.706
Kirsten, do you see your mother?

32:50.732 --> 32:53.169
Kirsten: <i>No,
she's sealed inside the chamber.</i>

32:53.194 --> 32:57.200
After 15 years, I'm looking forward
to talking to you face-to-face.

32:57.593 --> 32:59.495
Kirsten: <i>She's been
here since the accident.</i>

32:59.520 --> 33:03.512
I can't wait for you to tell everyone,
everything you've been telling me.

33:04.900 --> 33:08.464
I'm being pulled to another memory.

33:09.701 --> 33:12.224
Director Turner wants
the asset moved now!

33:12.249 --> 33:14.874
The "asset" is a human being.

33:14.899 --> 33:18.773
My mother was the "asset"
Stinger fought with Turner about.

33:18.798 --> 33:21.261
Why is she an asset?

33:21.559 --> 33:24.538
Mrs. Stinger hasn't been
prepared for extraction.

33:24.563 --> 33:26.257
Step aside.

33:26.867 --> 33:28.748
You can't take her like that!

33:28.773 --> 33:30.108
Khouri won't let them get to her.

33:30.133 --> 33:32.436
- (gunshot)
- NSA Guard: Dammit!

33:32.461 --> 33:34.758
He grabbed my gun!

33:40.336 --> 33:42.345
- What does she see?
- Kirsten, what's going on?

33:42.370 --> 33:44.762
They opened the chamber.

33:48.813 --> 33:50.834
They took her.

33:55.468 --> 33:58.212
Khouri, he's crawling into the chamber.
He's trying to...

33:58.237 --> 34:00.275
He's trying to survive.

34:05.443 --> 34:09.831
Dr. Khouri took care of your
mother for over 15 years.

34:09.856 --> 34:11.484
Guess what's back?

34:11.507 --> 34:12.313
The anomaly?

34:12.339 --> 34:14.596
- Track it!
- I'm working on it!

34:14.620 --> 34:16.100
Kirsten? What's going on in there?

34:16.125 --> 34:17.757
Do you know where she is?

34:17.782 --> 34:19.659
Shh. They can hear you.

34:19.685 --> 34:21.415
I don't care who can hear me.

34:21.440 --> 34:23.063
Do you know where my mother is?

34:23.088 --> 34:24.734
Who the hell is she speaking to?

34:24.759 --> 34:27.217
It's enough, already.
I need answers, please?

34:27.241 --> 34:28.809
Kirsten, who are you talking to?

34:28.833 --> 34:30.110
I... I'm talking to you.

34:30.135 --> 34:32.621
You, as a boy, you as I remember you

34:32.647 --> 34:34.886
when we were in the hospital as kids.

34:35.004 --> 34:36.993
Whoever that is, that's not me.

34:37.502 --> 34:40.745
Son of a bitch! Linus, track where that
source of the signal is coming from!

34:40.770 --> 34:42.647
You said the time for
answers was coming.

34:42.670 --> 34:45.297
Well, it's come. Now is the time.

34:46.384 --> 34:49.094
I got it! It's coming
from inside the lab!

34:49.119 --> 34:50.895
Wait, no! It's outside the lab.

34:51.438 --> 34:54.293
Wait, it's inside the lab again.

34:54.858 --> 34:57.537
- It's inside the quantum computer.
- It's a hack!

34:57.562 --> 34:59.879
You can't hack a quantum computer.

34:59.903 --> 35:02.274
You don't have to if you have
your own quantum computer.

35:02.299 --> 35:03.202
They're entangled.

35:03.227 --> 35:04.806
Talk to me, people. What's going on?

35:04.831 --> 35:07.252
Entanglement, it's a quantum phenomenon.

35:07.277 --> 35:09.627
It happens when one quantum
device affects another,

35:09.652 --> 35:11.275
even without being
psychically connected.

35:11.300 --> 35:12.329
It's the ultimate hack!

35:12.354 --> 35:13.792
There are five quantum
computers in the world,

35:13.817 --> 35:15.514
we only know the
whereabouts of four of them.

35:15.540 --> 35:17.419
Daniel Stinger owns the fifth one.

35:18.451 --> 35:21.669
Stinger's been running the
anomaly on us this entire time.

35:21.694 --> 35:25.501
You're right. It is time.

35:25.526 --> 35:28.609
- Are you ready to see your mother?
- Yes!

35:28.634 --> 35:30.288
Okay.

35:34.499 --> 35:37.638
Kirsten's... gone.

35:38.014 --> 35:40.115
What do you mean gone?

35:40.140 --> 35:42.163
- She's off the map.
- Well, get her back!

35:42.188 --> 35:43.911
(elevator beeps)

35:50.719 --> 35:54.730
Well, I'm sure you all remember,
Captain Stamperson?

35:55.162 --> 35:57.562
Shut it down, Captain.

35:57.587 --> 35:59.959
You heard him, Goodkin. It's over.

35:59.984 --> 36:01.904
- Stamperson, listen to me...
- Listen to you, what?

36:01.929 --> 36:04.631
Mock me? Insult my men?

36:04.656 --> 36:06.334
We've lost Kirsten.

36:06.359 --> 36:07.646
She's right there!

36:07.671 --> 36:10.513
Cameron: Not her body, you idiot.
Her mind, we cannot shut down right now.

36:10.538 --> 36:11.776
Not so fast, Detective.

36:11.801 --> 36:13.937
All of you, step away
from your equipment.

36:14.483 --> 36:16.380
You, put down that tablet.

36:16.405 --> 36:18.077
This is my one thing.

36:18.102 --> 36:21.689
I am not messing around, move it!

36:22.852 --> 36:24.652
That's more like it.

36:28.353 --> 36:32.362
Remember when we met? When you thought
it was fun giving me a hard time?

36:32.387 --> 36:35.116
Well, payback's a bitch.

36:35.141 --> 36:36.662
Tim: Excuse me?

36:50.897 --> 36:53.155
Tim, well done.

36:53.666 --> 36:56.699
Secure them in the interrogation room.

37:04.030 --> 37:07.301
You haven't just crossed a line,
Baptiste, you've crossed me.

37:07.326 --> 37:11.336
Fisher, please escort Mr. Blair
to our interrogation room.

37:15.350 --> 37:16.816
We're good together.

37:16.841 --> 37:18.556
This is what I've been saying.

37:19.023 --> 37:21.584
There's still no sign of
her on Khouri's memory map.

37:21.609 --> 37:23.949
That's because she's
in a another memory.

37:23.974 --> 37:25.398
Whose?

37:25.675 --> 37:27.663
Hers.

37:43.595 --> 37:45.445
Mom...

37:47.035 --> 37:48.668
Whoever's hacked the system,

37:48.693 --> 37:51.921
rerouted the stitch away from
Khouri and back into Kirsten.

37:52.258 --> 37:54.754
Kirsten, where are you?

37:57.974 --> 37:59.820
How do you feel?

38:02.230 --> 38:04.474
Like I'm home.

38:04.499 --> 38:06.362
Stinger must be using a digital avatar,

38:06.387 --> 38:09.488
he created of you as a kid to pull
Kirsten deeper into her own mind.

38:09.513 --> 38:12.247
Kirsten, you gotta get out of there,
make the bounce!

38:12.300 --> 38:14.768
Kirsten? Kirsten!

38:14.793 --> 38:16.706
How long can she stay in
there without bouncing?

38:16.731 --> 38:19.230
I don't know, it's not a stitch,
so there's no time limit.

38:19.255 --> 38:21.364
Cameron: Linus, can you isolate the
signal that's driving this avatar?

38:21.389 --> 38:23.176
- Yes! Do you want me to cut it off?
- Yes!

38:23.201 --> 38:25.238
Wait, no!

38:25.263 --> 38:26.708
I want you to hijack it.

38:26.733 --> 38:28.686
It's so beautiful.

38:29.740 --> 38:32.735
I never want to leave.

38:32.760 --> 38:34.953
You never have to.

38:36.428 --> 38:39.011
You want to hijack
the hijacker's signal?

38:39.036 --> 38:41.614
Yes, that way I can talk to Kirsten
directly from inside of her own memory.

38:41.639 --> 38:43.045
As the kid version of you?

38:43.070 --> 38:45.803
I don't know, she already trusts the little
bastard, so maybe, I or he or whatever

38:45.828 --> 38:46.887
can convince her to make the bounce.

38:46.912 --> 38:48.789
Okay, Linus, when I cue you,

38:48.814 --> 38:50.793
cut the hijack connection,
at that exact same moment,

38:50.818 --> 38:52.714
Camille, I want you to reroute
that over to my station.

38:52.995 --> 38:55.675
_

38:55.700 --> 38:57.799
All right, go!

38:57.824 --> 38:59.553
Severing the hijacked signal...

38:59.578 --> 39:01.179
And rerouting to your station...

39:01.204 --> 39:02.204
Both: Now!

39:03.036 --> 39:04.466
Okay, got it.

39:04.491 --> 39:06.807
Kirsten, can you hear me?

39:07.556 --> 39:09.743
Kirsten, can you hear me?

39:09.768 --> 39:11.471
Yeah.

39:11.496 --> 39:13.057
Okay, it's time to go now.

39:13.083 --> 39:14.953
Why?

39:14.978 --> 39:17.776
Why would I ever leave this memory?

39:17.801 --> 39:19.850
Whatever you think you're seeing,

39:19.874 --> 39:21.227
it's not your mother.

39:21.253 --> 39:22.564
But it is.

39:22.589 --> 39:24.204
That's my mother.

39:24.229 --> 39:28.102
And she's so beautiful, she's perfect.

39:28.127 --> 39:29.870
She's not real.

39:30.575 --> 39:32.637
But somewhere out there,
is your real mother

39:32.662 --> 39:34.290
and I'm going to help
you find her, okay?

39:34.315 --> 39:37.040
No, no. I'm done.

39:37.065 --> 39:39.437
I'm tired of looking.

39:39.462 --> 39:41.234
You have Nina.

39:41.259 --> 39:43.299
And I have her.

39:44.086 --> 39:46.241
I'm finally home!

39:46.266 --> 39:50.426
You're right. I do have Nina.

39:51.460 --> 39:54.294
But that doesn't mean
that you don't have me.

39:54.319 --> 39:58.899
You have a flesh and blood
family who loves you.

39:59.350 --> 40:01.708
<i>Your friends.</i>

40:04.073 --> 40:06.277
Don't leave us behind.

40:06.302 --> 40:10.759
Kirsten: <i>Sooner or later,
everyone leaves everyone.</i>

40:10.784 --> 40:14.023
But my mother never left me.

40:14.048 --> 40:16.944
I know that now.

40:18.151 --> 40:21.803
She was in my heart the whole time.

40:23.925 --> 40:26.766
Maybe you're right.

40:30.295 --> 40:33.784
Maybe most people leave
sooner or later...

40:37.531 --> 40:39.243
but you and I...

40:39.936 --> 40:43.093
are not most people.

40:52.792 --> 40:54.959
No matter what you think,

40:54.984 --> 40:59.264
no matter how long it takes...

41:00.067 --> 41:03.048
I will never leave you.
