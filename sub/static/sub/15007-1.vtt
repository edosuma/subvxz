03:10.844 --> 03:12.944
I do not expect anyone to believe...

03:13.044 --> 03:15.780
...the story  I'm about to relate. ...

03:15.880 --> 03:17.616
...It even seems  incredible to me...

03:17.716 --> 03:20.285
...that all that I have
passed through......

03:20.385 --> 03:22.621
......all those weird
and terrifying experiences,

03:22.721 --> 03:24.923
should have been encompassed
within as short a span...

03:25.023 --> 03:28.659
...as three brief months.

03:28.727 --> 03:30.329
It must have been  a little after...

03:30.429 --> 03:33.965
...3:00 in the afternoon
 that it began. ...

03:34.065 --> 03:38.202
...The afternoon  of June 3, 1916.

03:49.481 --> 03:53.684
S.S. Montrose, 20,000 tons.

03:58.357 --> 04:00.058
Range--1, 000 meter.

04:00.158 --> 04:02.593
Range--1,000 meter.

04:02.661 --> 04:04.662
Depth--nine meter.

04:04.730 --> 04:06.265
Depth--nine meter.

04:06.365 --> 04:08.365
Bow tubes one and two.

04:09.267 --> 04:10.369
Hold.

04:10.469 --> 04:14.071
Hold.

04:14.138 --> 04:16.475
Fire one. Number one tube fired.

04:16.575 --> 04:17.942
Fire two.

04:18.041 --> 04:20.041
Number two tube fired.

04:33.258 --> 04:36.403
Add another 20,000 tons to our total.

04:38.296 --> 04:40.699
Orders to surface, herr kapitaen?

04:40.799 --> 04:42.200
No, Dietz.

04:42.300 --> 04:44.536
Survivors may live to fight another day.

04:44.636 --> 04:48.572
They're in enough trouble already.

04:48.640 --> 04:51.975
Besides... These were civilians.

04:54.212 --> 04:56.212
Down periscope.

05:23.508 --> 05:25.609
The ship...

05:25.677 --> 05:27.677
We were torpedoed.

05:28.580 --> 05:31.640
Looks like we're the only survivors.

05:33.819 --> 05:35.819
Will they find us?

05:47.198 --> 05:51.301
Ahoy. Ahoy there.

05:51.369 --> 05:53.369
Ahoy.

05:53.605 --> 05:58.141
Ahoy. Where are you?.

05:58.209 --> 06:01.278
Over here. Ahoy.

06:01.346 --> 06:03.948
Over here.

06:04.015 --> 06:06.184
There on the port bow, Mr. Bradley.

06:06.284 --> 06:08.284
Rest oars.

06:33.545 --> 06:34.613
Up you come, me darlin'.

06:34.713 --> 06:37.783
Welcome aboard, miss Clayton, Mr. Tyler.

06:37.883 --> 06:39.418
Sinclair, if you look in my bag,

06:39.518 --> 06:40.585
there's some Brandy.

06:40.685 --> 06:42.685
Aye, sir.

06:51.763 --> 06:53.763
Mr. Tyler.

07:04.809 --> 07:06.578
Did any of the other boats get away?

07:06.678 --> 07:08.513
I'm afraid not.

07:08.613 --> 07:11.248
We were sure lucky to find you.

07:13.752 --> 07:15.752
Olson, take the tiller.

07:20.692 --> 07:22.193
Not quite so lucky I'm afraid.

07:22.293 --> 07:24.262
We've only got about a
half gallon of water...

07:24.362 --> 07:25.564
...and no food.

07:25.664 --> 07:27.866
Young whiteley managed
to get through with an sos,

07:27.966 --> 07:30.836
but had no chance to tell them where

07:30.936 --> 07:33.472
As far as they're concerned, we...

07:33.572 --> 07:35.612
...we could be anywhere.

07:36.407 --> 07:38.577
Herr kapitaen, borg requests permission...

07:38.677 --> 07:41.379
...to surface and recharge batteries.

07:41.479 --> 07:44.315
Very well, Dietz. Prepare to surface.

07:44.415 --> 07:46.415
Jawohl, kapitaen.

07:48.186 --> 07:50.481
Up periscope. Up periscope.

08:06.270 --> 08:07.405
Thick fog.

08:07.505 --> 08:09.107
Perfect cover for us.

08:09.207 --> 08:11.842
Down periscope. Down periscope.

08:14.613 --> 08:15.914
Both engines full ahead.

08:16.014 --> 08:18.054
Both engines full ahead.

08:23.655 --> 08:25.456
Mr. Bradley.

08:25.556 --> 08:27.556
Shh.

08:30.394 --> 08:32.774
There's something out there.

08:44.109 --> 08:45.443
It can't be a fishing boat,

08:45.543 --> 08:46.611
we're too far from land.

08:46.711 --> 08:49.379
Shh. Quiet.

09:03.662 --> 09:05.496
It's a u-boat.

09:05.596 --> 09:07.365
It must be the one that sunk us.

09:07.465 --> 09:09.701
We'd better take cover until it submerges.

09:09.801 --> 09:12.136
No, wait. If we get aboard,
we can surprise them...

09:12.236 --> 09:13.705
...as they come through the hatch.

09:13.805 --> 09:14.806
We wouldn't stand a chance.

09:14.906 --> 09:16.007
It's the only chance we have.

09:16.107 --> 09:17.642
I know these boats like
the back of my hand.

09:17.742 --> 09:19.110
Now, we've got about two minutes...

09:19.210 --> 09:21.505
...before that hatch opens.

09:29.587 --> 09:31.056
Right.

09:31.156 --> 09:33.691
Let's try it. Pull away.

10:47.866 --> 10:51.268
Quiet, captain.

10:51.335 --> 10:52.403
Kommen sie hier.

10:52.503 --> 10:54.503
Shh.

10:58.276 --> 11:00.276
Achtung.

11:21.966 --> 11:23.966
Aah.

11:24.335 --> 11:26.335
Now, don't move.

11:27.672 --> 11:30.137
Smith, go help Olson. Benson.

11:39.984 --> 11:41.984
Aah.

11:42.921 --> 11:44.921
Come on.

12:23.828 --> 12:25.828
Aah.

13:28.459 --> 13:30.195
Good work, Bradley.

13:30.295 --> 13:33.397
Well, commander, now that you have us,

13:33.497 --> 13:35.300
what do you propose to do with us?

13:35.400 --> 13:38.136
Are you all right? I'm fine, thank you.

13:38.236 --> 13:40.604
I'll tell you what we're
gonna do with you, captain--...

13:40.704 --> 13:42.773
...put you in the nearest British port.

13:42.873 --> 13:47.244
And you expect me to take you there?

13:47.312 --> 13:50.180
Captain Von schoenvorts.

13:50.248 --> 13:51.782
Schoenvorts.

13:51.882 --> 13:53.151
I'm afraid you have no choice.

13:53.251 --> 13:55.019
And how will you know if I'm coursing...

13:55.119 --> 13:56.754
...for england or Germany?

13:56.854 --> 13:57.922
We're all seamen, captain.

13:58.022 --> 13:59.657
We know how to read a compass.

13:59.757 --> 14:01.792
Oh, and Von schoenvorts...

14:01.892 --> 14:02.994
I don't suppose you've heard...

14:03.094 --> 14:05.663
...of the tylers of Santa Monica?

14:05.763 --> 14:07.465
Well, I'm bowen Tyler,

14:07.565 --> 14:09.667
and my father was building
these submarines...

14:09.767 --> 14:10.835
...before you even thought of them.

14:10.935 --> 14:12.935
Stop him, Jones.

14:16.740 --> 14:18.740
Hold it.

14:24.482 --> 14:26.482
Radio.

14:29.920 --> 14:32.957
Now there's no chance
of contacting allied shipping.

14:33.057 --> 14:34.792
May I suggest, Mr. Tyler, that--

14:34.892 --> 14:36.892
I'll suggest.

14:38.262 --> 14:42.165
I suggest, captain,
captain Von schoenvorts...

14:44.502 --> 14:46.504
...that you tell your men
that we're in control,

14:46.604 --> 14:48.605
and if you don't...

14:48.672 --> 14:49.941
You'll find you and your crew...

14:50.041 --> 14:53.186
...where you found us-- in the water.

14:55.746 --> 14:58.649
Achtung,  Von schoenvorts......

14:58.749 --> 15:00.919
...This boat is now
under command...

15:01.019 --> 15:03.754
...of our enemy--  Mr. Tyler. ...

15:03.854 --> 15:08.019
...You will obey his orders...
For the time being.

15:12.330 --> 15:14.330
Lock him up, Bradley.

15:26.610 --> 15:30.113
Bradley, is that a British warship?

15:32.816 --> 15:35.452
It is indeed. We're in luck.

15:35.520 --> 15:39.770
We think we've spotted
a British warship. Stand by.

15:47.665 --> 15:49.665
Keep signaling.

15:59.977 --> 16:03.972
A few more of those,
and they'll have our range.

16:07.851 --> 16:09.420
It's no good. They don't read us.

16:09.520 --> 16:12.790
Or they don't believe us. Let's get below.

16:12.890 --> 16:14.890
Prepare to dive.

16:19.930 --> 16:22.165
Dive. Dive. Dive.

16:29.907 --> 16:32.010
Bow down angle-- seven degrees.

16:32.110 --> 16:33.244
Level off at 20.

16:33.344 --> 16:35.344
Level off at 20.

16:42.886 --> 16:44.455
Thirty-five slowing.

16:44.555 --> 16:47.724
Five degrees leveling.

16:54.064 --> 16:55.333
Slow both engines. Kleine fahrt.

16:55.433 --> 16:57.433
Slow both engines.

17:14.685 --> 17:17.354
Boat gaining depth-- 50 meters.

17:17.421 --> 17:19.888
Bow down angle-- 15 degrees.

17:19.957 --> 17:21.492
Blow two and three.

17:21.592 --> 17:23.428
No. You'll give away our position.

17:23.528 --> 17:24.662
Both engines half ahead.

17:24.762 --> 17:26.464
Both engines half ahead.

17:26.564 --> 17:28.566
Increasing depth-- 55 meter.

17:28.666 --> 17:30.201
Let her sink to the bottom.

17:30.301 --> 17:32.903
You don't know how deep it is here.

17:33.003 --> 17:35.505
She'll only stand 65 meter.

17:35.573 --> 17:38.476
Boat still gaining in depth--60 meter.

17:38.576 --> 17:41.578
Bow down angle-- ten degrees.

17:43.847 --> 17:45.948
Sixty-three meter.

17:48.786 --> 17:50.786
Sixty-five meter.

17:57.027 --> 17:59.729
Level at the bow.

17:59.797 --> 18:02.399
Sixty-seven meter.

18:07.605 --> 18:09.605
Sixty-nine meter.

18:11.475 --> 18:12.543
Stop both engines.

18:12.643 --> 18:14.643
Stop both engines.

18:25.223 --> 18:28.292
You can blow two and three now, Mr. Dietz.

18:28.392 --> 18:30.694
Blow two and three. Blow two and three.

18:30.794 --> 18:32.396
Both engines slow ahead.

18:32.496 --> 18:34.536
Both engines slow ahead.

18:37.134 --> 18:39.269
Very good, Mr. Tyler.

18:50.114 --> 18:52.783
There was only  one
thing we could do--...

18:52.883 --> 18:54.718
...head the u-boat  on
a Western course...

18:54.818 --> 18:57.522
...and try to reach  a
neutral American port...

18:57.622 --> 18:59.917
...before our fuel ran out.

19:06.297 --> 19:08.431
Bradley...

19:08.499 --> 19:12.036
We've been going due
west for six days now...

19:12.136 --> 19:13.304
...yet in all this time...

19:13.404 --> 19:15.540
...we haven't seen one single ship.

19:15.640 --> 19:17.107
And having crossed the Atlantic,

19:17.207 --> 19:18.342
we should have sighted...

19:18.442 --> 19:20.077
...the north American coast by now.

19:20.177 --> 19:21.812
This sure as hell isn't
north Atlantic weather,

19:21.912 --> 19:24.122
not this time of the year.

19:26.517 --> 19:28.517
Dietz.

19:30.588 --> 19:33.624
Either the sun is rising in the South...

19:33.724 --> 19:36.954
Or our compass has been tampered with.

19:50.240 --> 19:53.300
We've been going South for six days.

20:05.723 --> 20:09.559
My guess... Is right here.

20:09.627 --> 20:11.752
But that's South America.

20:14.198 --> 20:16.663
Exactly where I wanted to go.

20:18.001 --> 20:20.804
Schwartz, take the helm.

20:20.871 --> 20:23.207
Did you think that as
commander of this ship

20:23.307 --> 20:25.857
I would not have a master key?

20:30.080 --> 20:33.383
Now, there is a German supply ship...

20:33.451 --> 20:35.985
...operating in this area...

20:36.053 --> 20:39.956
...and we should rendezvous
within the hour.

20:40.023 --> 20:42.459
And you, commander...

20:42.526 --> 20:43.961
Will be transferred to her...

20:44.061 --> 20:46.101
...and shot as a pirate.

21:01.512 --> 21:03.881
I apologize for disturbing
you, miss Clayton.

21:03.981 --> 21:06.216
Might I collect some of my papers?

21:06.316 --> 21:07.618
Yes, of course.

21:07.718 --> 21:09.718
Thank you.

21:11.622 --> 21:14.358
Well, are you making yourself comfortable?

21:14.458 --> 21:15.526
Yes, thank you, captain.

21:15.626 --> 21:17.626
Good.

21:20.364 --> 21:22.700
Did you know that Mr. Tyler was planning...

21:22.800 --> 21:25.502
...to take us to new england?

21:27.104 --> 21:30.940
I find his yankee ingeniousness...

21:31.008 --> 21:33.309
...almost frightening.

21:33.377 --> 21:36.846
You know, I'm a biologist, captain.

21:36.914 --> 21:38.949
I study the structure of living things,

21:39.049 --> 21:41.786
their motivations, and their behavior,

21:41.886 --> 21:44.287
but I don't understand you.

21:44.354 --> 21:47.625
How can anyone who is so
interested in life...

21:47.725 --> 21:49.560
...follow a profession which is devoted...

21:49.660 --> 21:51.094
...to destruction and killing?

21:51.194 --> 21:53.564
The study of nature, miss Clayton,

21:53.664 --> 21:56.166
has taught me that life is founded...

21:56.266 --> 21:57.901
...upon killing and destruction.

21:58.001 --> 22:01.137
The sea swarms with living things...

22:01.204 --> 22:03.173
...that prey on one another to survive.

22:03.273 --> 22:06.142
But human beings needn't.

22:06.209 --> 22:08.212
The ship you torpedoed
contained nothing...

22:08.312 --> 22:10.914
...but innocent passengers--
women and children.

22:11.014 --> 22:13.150
And a hold full of arms and ammunition...

22:13.250 --> 22:15.285
...that would be used to
kill women and children...

22:15.385 --> 22:16.787
...in my country.

22:16.887 --> 22:18.887
Oh, yes.

22:18.889 --> 22:21.124
How else would it have
exploded so quickly?

22:21.224 --> 22:23.626
Anyway...

22:23.694 --> 22:26.663
We will talk again, miss Clayton.

22:26.730 --> 22:28.730
Good-bye.

22:31.435 --> 22:33.730
Up periscope. Up periscope.

22:42.312 --> 22:45.181
Good. There's our supply ship.

22:45.248 --> 22:47.883
Down periscope. Down periscope.

22:49.687 --> 22:51.687
Prepare to surface.

22:53.256 --> 22:54.958
Both engines full ahead.

22:55.058 --> 22:57.098
Both engines full ahead.

23:54.652 --> 23:56.652
Shh. It's me.

25:26.110 --> 25:31.147
Our bow is pointing
directly at the German ship.

25:31.214 --> 25:33.509
Let's give them a surprise.

25:51.568 --> 25:54.968
Tubes flooded. Ready to fire, Mr. Tyler.

26:37.881 --> 26:41.617
Nice shooting, Mr. Tyler.

26:41.685 --> 26:45.988
She had fuel, supplies, fresh water.

26:46.056 --> 26:48.458
We have enough supplies for one week.

26:48.558 --> 26:52.043
What do you propose
to do now, commander?

26:57.034 --> 26:59.136
Bradley, put captain Von schoenvorts...

26:59.236 --> 27:00.303
...back in the cooler.

27:00.403 --> 27:01.471
Take him with you.

27:01.571 --> 27:03.571
Get on the helm, Dietz.

27:24.228 --> 27:28.898
We conserve our fuel,
we go on half rations.

27:28.966 --> 27:31.234
And we'll see where the
current will take us.

27:31.334 --> 27:33.334
Precisely.

27:34.938 --> 27:36.339
Against my better judgment,

27:36.439 --> 27:40.264
your instincts have
proved to be right so far.

27:40.911 --> 27:43.712
I can handle my crew.

27:43.781 --> 27:45.991
You understand submarines.

27:47.517 --> 27:51.682
I consider that to be
our good fortune, commander.

28:03.267 --> 28:05.267
Mr. Bradley.

28:06.103 --> 28:07.404
Icebergs.

28:07.504 --> 28:09.738
No.

28:09.807 --> 28:12.076
There are no icebergs
north of 14 in these waters.

28:12.176 --> 28:14.176
That much I know.

28:15.212 --> 28:18.187
Then we must be South of 14, Dietz.

28:19.382 --> 28:21.382
Impossible.

28:24.554 --> 28:25.589
Hello, sir.

28:25.689 --> 28:27.689
Hello, sinclair.

28:29.226 --> 28:31.727
Open the door. Right, sir.

28:42.806 --> 28:45.241
Captain. Mr. Tyler.

28:45.309 --> 28:47.309
Come on.

28:58.989 --> 29:00.989
Sit down.

29:08.298 --> 29:10.298
Would you like a drink?

29:23.947 --> 29:26.782
Captain Von schoenvorts, I, uh...

29:29.987 --> 29:31.121
I need your help.

29:31.221 --> 29:33.322
You need my help?

29:36.026 --> 29:38.026
How?

29:38.395 --> 29:40.395
We're lost.

29:44.667 --> 29:46.667
I will help you.

29:52.542 --> 29:54.542
No tricks.

29:54.744 --> 29:56.744
No tricks.

30:21.838 --> 30:23.173
What do you make of it?

30:23.273 --> 30:27.410
Did you ever hear of caproni?

30:27.477 --> 30:29.079
An early Italian navigator.

30:29.179 --> 30:32.114
He followed cook about 1721.

30:32.182 --> 30:34.451
People scoffed at his claims,

30:34.551 --> 30:36.653
but I remember reading in his book...

30:36.753 --> 30:39.256
...in which he describes a new continent...

30:39.356 --> 30:41.058
...in the South seas--...

30:41.158 --> 30:43.894
...a rockbound inhospitable coast...

30:43.994 --> 30:45.896
...without beach or harbor...

30:45.996 --> 30:48.398
...where he could make no landing.

30:48.498 --> 30:50.498
He saw no sign of life.

30:50.500 --> 30:54.403
He called it caprona and sailed away.

30:57.007 --> 31:01.978
I believe that we are looking
at the coast of caprona--...

31:02.045 --> 31:06.349
...uncharted and forgotten for 200 years.

31:09.219 --> 31:11.654
Well, we'll have to do
what he couldn't do--...

31:11.754 --> 31:13.822
...find a place to land.

31:13.890 --> 31:16.525
If we don't...

31:16.593 --> 31:18.593
...we'll die.

31:28.972 --> 31:31.267
It seems there's no way in.

31:48.225 --> 31:49.259
It is warm.

31:49.359 --> 31:51.527
Mr. Bradley.

31:51.594 --> 31:53.594
It's warm water, sir.

31:54.731 --> 31:56.033
What is it? What'd you find?

31:56.133 --> 31:58.068
Well, this is fresh water, and it's warm.

31:58.168 --> 31:59.236
There must be a river...

31:59.336 --> 32:00.670
...flowing into the sea near here.

32:00.770 --> 32:01.838
Mr. Tyler.

32:01.938 --> 32:03.938
There is your river.

32:06.443 --> 32:07.710
An underground river?

32:07.810 --> 32:09.279
We'll need the wings of angels...

32:09.379 --> 32:10.847
...to find out where it starts.

32:10.947 --> 32:12.715
I don't think so, Mr. Olson,

32:12.815 --> 32:14.950
not with this submarine.

32:15.018 --> 32:17.587
If that tunnel's as big as it looks,

32:17.687 --> 32:19.687
we might get through.

33:24.754 --> 33:27.022
Steady at the helm.

33:35.565 --> 33:37.567
She's veering starboard two degrees.

33:37.667 --> 33:39.202
Ease off two degrees.

33:39.302 --> 33:41.803
Ease off two degrees.

33:54.851 --> 33:55.818
Steady.

33:55.918 --> 33:57.787
Both engines half ahead.

33:57.887 --> 33:59.927
Both engines half ahead.

34:09.498 --> 34:11.708
Starboard, there's a turn.

34:22.110 --> 34:24.110
Starboard.

34:28.652 --> 34:30.692
Full power both engines.

34:30.719 --> 34:32.760
Full power both engines.

34:34.991 --> 34:37.626
More power. Give me more power.

34:40.996 --> 34:42.331
We have full maximum power now, sir.

34:42.431 --> 34:44.266
Step up the mains,
it'll give us three more knots.

34:44.367 --> 34:45.569
Herr kapitaen.

34:45.668 --> 34:47.404
Step up the mains,
it'll give us three more knots.

34:47.504 --> 34:49.504
Borg.

34:50.806 --> 34:54.292
Step up the mains for full maximum power.

35:00.183 --> 35:02.183
Half power port.

35:03.052 --> 35:04.187
Starboard engine one half.

35:04.287 --> 35:05.888
Full on port engine.

35:05.988 --> 35:08.453
Full on port engine. Hang on.

35:16.733 --> 35:19.198
Borg, check the aft bearings.

35:19.202 --> 35:21.870
Aft bearings. Jawohl, kapitaen.

35:26.376 --> 35:28.376
Slow both engines.

35:34.917 --> 35:36.286
Two degrees starboard.

35:36.386 --> 35:38.386
Two degrees starboard.

35:42.992 --> 35:44.992
I see light.

35:47.096 --> 35:49.096
I think we're through.

36:01.027 --> 36:03.027
What a sight.

36:08.868 --> 36:10.868
What is it, Mr. Tyler?

36:11.672 --> 36:13.672
Nothing.

36:14.874 --> 36:15.942
Down periscope.

36:16.042 --> 36:18.110
Down periscope.

37:27.381 --> 37:30.082
They look like pterodactyl.

37:30.150 --> 37:31.618
But--but they can't be.

37:31.718 --> 37:35.373
They've been extinct for millions of years.

37:37.624 --> 37:40.359
If I am not mistaken...

37:40.427 --> 37:44.263
That is a diplodocus.

37:44.331 --> 37:46.331
A diplodocus?

37:50.704 --> 37:53.339
Plesser, lay out the lead line.

37:53.340 --> 37:55.508
Schwartz, hatch covers.

38:03.850 --> 38:06.145
Look at that big crocodile.

38:07.020 --> 38:09.020
Plesser.

38:18.732 --> 38:20.732
Lisa, get below.

38:22.469 --> 38:24.469
Von schoenvorts.

38:33.814 --> 38:35.814
Bowen.

38:44.825 --> 38:46.825
Aah.

39:00.874 --> 39:02.874
Olson.

39:10.784 --> 39:12.784
Olson.

39:35.341 --> 39:37.743
Ah, splendid, Olson.

39:37.811 --> 39:39.613
With the compliments of the chef,

39:39.713 --> 39:40.980
lady and gentlemen.

39:41.080 --> 39:42.549
Miss Clayton.

39:42.649 --> 39:44.318
Is plesiosaurus a common dish...

39:44.418 --> 39:45.952
...in the British Navy, Mr. Olson?

39:46.052 --> 39:47.053
Ah, no, ma'am.

39:47.153 --> 39:48.422
The chef confessed complete ignorance...

39:48.522 --> 39:50.056
...of how to cook such a beast.

39:50.156 --> 39:51.458
This is an old Irish recipe

39:51.558 --> 39:54.108
I dreamed up for the occasion.

39:55.028 --> 39:57.329
Thank you, Olson.

39:57.397 --> 39:59.199
Bon appA(Copyright)tit.

39:59.299 --> 40:01.333
Thank you, Mr. Olson.

40:01.401 --> 40:02.936
Should one drink white or red wine...

40:03.036 --> 40:06.691
...with plesiosaurus, herr Von schoenvorts?

40:08.341 --> 40:10.543
Mmm. Excellent.

40:19.653 --> 40:23.255
Commander, I have a proposition for you.

40:23.323 --> 40:26.258
For us here, the war in Europe...

40:26.326 --> 40:28.393
...is meaningless, yes?

40:28.462 --> 40:32.131
And I suggest that we
forget those differences...

40:32.231 --> 40:35.402
...and work together
for our mutual survival.

40:35.502 --> 40:36.936
That sounds good in principle,

40:37.036 --> 40:38.538
captain Von schoenvorts,

40:38.638 --> 40:40.173
but what if we were to find...

40:40.273 --> 40:41.541
...some means of escape?

40:41.641 --> 40:42.976
In that event,

40:43.076 --> 40:45.679
we will take the submarine
to a neutral port...

40:45.779 --> 40:48.839
...and surrender to the authorities.

40:49.315 --> 40:51.450
All right.

40:51.518 --> 40:52.586
But who's gonna command...

40:52.686 --> 40:54.254
...our little force in caprona?

40:54.354 --> 40:57.890
I will command my men, Mr. Bradley his,

40:57.958 --> 40:59.959
the three of us will make the rules,

41:00.059 --> 41:03.363
and you, Mr. Tyler, as a sort of neutral,

41:03.463 --> 41:05.098
will be in charge.

41:05.198 --> 41:06.266
Agreed.

41:06.366 --> 41:08.366
Agreed.

41:08.869 --> 41:10.637
Our time together, gentlemen,

41:10.737 --> 41:13.882
promises to be extremely interesting.

41:20.714 --> 41:24.114
Well, gentlemen, what do you make of it?

41:25.886 --> 41:29.287
I'd say caprona was a volcanic crater.

41:29.355 --> 41:30.424
A volcano, miss Clayton?

41:30.524 --> 41:31.658
Mm-hmm.

41:31.758 --> 41:34.961
But it's at least, oh, 200 Miles across.

41:35.061 --> 41:37.330
I'd say it could be the largest volcano...

41:37.430 --> 41:40.232
...in the history of our planet.

41:41.735 --> 41:43.269
Ah, good.

41:43.369 --> 41:45.071
Gentlemen, will you excuse me?

41:45.171 --> 41:47.073
I want to analyze these samples...

41:47.173 --> 41:51.176
...from a very remarkable river.

41:53.813 --> 41:56.515
The water's absolutely alive.

42:00.587 --> 42:01.922
They're not like anything

42:02.022 --> 42:03.389
I've ever seen before.

42:03.489 --> 42:06.092
They almost seem to have a purpose.

42:06.192 --> 42:09.895
German metaphysics.

42:09.963 --> 42:11.832
British empiricism.

42:11.932 --> 42:15.133
Until we find a stream or pool...

42:15.201 --> 42:17.903
...that is free of them,

42:17.971 --> 42:20.606
we will have no drinking water.

42:27.213 --> 42:31.450
Stop both engines. We're anchoring here.

42:31.517 --> 42:34.319
Hindle, launch the boat.

43:30.977 --> 43:34.146
It's like a geologic exhibit.

43:34.213 --> 43:38.450
A world of life outside of time,

43:38.518 --> 43:43.155
yet representing almost all
the ages of the earth.

43:43.222 --> 43:44.424
Wonderful.

43:44.524 --> 43:45.592
Wunderbar.

43:45.692 --> 43:47.926
Yes, wunderbar.

44:15.188 --> 44:17.557
This water certainly tastes good, whiteley.

44:17.657 --> 44:19.657
Can.

47:34.687 --> 47:37.523
Caprona has damn little
respect for guns, Mr. Tyler.

47:37.623 --> 47:40.526
No, there's nothing wrong
with our shooting, gentlemen.

47:40.626 --> 47:43.663
In primitive nervous systems
like this allosaurus,

47:43.763 --> 47:46.499
even a fatal wound
might register in the brain...

47:46.599 --> 47:49.768
...with a delayed action.

47:49.835 --> 47:51.938
As your saying would have it,

47:52.038 --> 47:55.523
'this chap was late for his own funeral.'

48:09.355 --> 48:11.124
Hold him-- hold him down.

48:11.224 --> 48:12.692
Get him down. Get him down.

48:12.792 --> 48:14.493
Ga-lu.

48:14.593 --> 48:16.593
Shh.

48:17.330 --> 48:19.731
Ga-lu. Ga-lu.

48:20.967 --> 48:22.202
Ga-lu.

48:22.302 --> 48:24.070
Ga-lu?

48:24.170 --> 48:25.839
Bo-lu. Bo-lu?

48:25.939 --> 48:28.106
Bo-lu.

48:28.174 --> 48:29.675
Bo-lu.

48:29.775 --> 48:31.910
Bo-lu. Bo-lu?

48:31.978 --> 48:34.746
Bo-lu. Bo-lu.

48:34.814 --> 48:36.814
Bo-lu?

48:37.817 --> 48:40.885
Ahm. Ahm.

48:40.954 --> 48:42.355
Ahm?

48:42.455 --> 48:44.455
Ahm.

48:44.657 --> 48:46.326
Bowen.

48:46.426 --> 48:48.426
B-- b--bowen.

48:52.398 --> 48:54.267
Calm.

48:54.367 --> 48:56.367
Easy.

49:01.307 --> 49:03.042
Let's get back to the submarine.

49:03.142 --> 49:05.142
Look out. Ga-lu.

49:06.112 --> 49:08.613
Ga-lu. Ga-lu.

49:08.681 --> 49:10.283
Sorry, ahm. No, Mr. Tyler.

49:10.383 --> 49:11.951
He was trying to tell you something.

49:12.051 --> 49:13.586
Well, he could've done it
a little less forcefully.

49:13.686 --> 49:15.922
He's not an animal. He had a reason.

49:16.022 --> 49:17.790
Now we should go.

49:17.890 --> 49:19.692
All right.

49:19.792 --> 49:21.861
Can we take him back to the submarine?

49:21.961 --> 49:23.961
He may be of use to us.

49:29.602 --> 49:32.438
Ahm had been friendly
until I tried to go South...

49:32.538 --> 49:36.276
...instead of north  as
he had indicated. ...

49:36.376 --> 49:40.966
...I was not to realize why
 until much later.

49:41.514 --> 49:43.615
Sinclair. Mr. Tyler.

49:46.785 --> 49:48.785
Help them up.

49:50.089 --> 49:52.089
I've got him.

50:12.245 --> 50:13.913
 Jawohl. ...

50:14.013 --> 50:16.308
...Jawohl.  Jawohl.

50:19.018 --> 50:21.587
What an amazing experience
it must be for him.

50:21.687 --> 50:23.122
No more amazing than finding...

50:23.222 --> 50:25.224
...ourselves here, miss Clayton.

50:25.324 --> 50:28.161
His companions were a great puzzle.

50:28.261 --> 50:33.831
Some were almost like apes,
others closer to...

50:33.899 --> 50:37.369
Such variety in a single tribe.

50:37.437 --> 50:39.437
Why?

50:47.146 --> 50:50.631
There you are, my friend. Match, a match.

50:53.652 --> 50:55.652
He knows about fire.

50:56.622 --> 50:58.057
He's trying to tell you...

50:58.157 --> 51:00.626
...that it comes from the ground.

51:00.726 --> 51:02.595
Fire from the ground.

51:02.695 --> 51:06.565
Could be volcanic or natural gas or...

51:06.632 --> 51:07.967
Oil.

51:08.067 --> 51:10.067
Herr kapitaen.

51:10.703 --> 51:12.372
Ja, ja.

51:12.472 --> 51:14.839
Ja, oil.

51:16.442 --> 51:18.177
Oil.

51:18.277 --> 51:21.347
If you know where there's
enough oil, we can refine it.

51:21.447 --> 51:23.149
We've got all the equipment we need.

51:23.249 --> 51:24.583
Nein, nein, nein. This is crude oil.

51:24.683 --> 51:26.019
This is no good for my engines.

51:26.119 --> 51:27.820
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

51:27.920 --> 51:31.590
It might knock the guts
out of our engines, but...

51:31.690 --> 51:32.958
...it could get us all home.

51:33.058 --> 51:35.793
Yes, I think it is worth a try.

51:35.861 --> 51:37.861
Good old ahm.

51:58.484 --> 52:00.484
Come on, ahm.

52:04.757 --> 52:06.991
I said, come on.

52:09.862 --> 52:12.397
Sto-lu. Sto-lu.

52:12.465 --> 52:15.433
Ahm...Bo-lu.

52:16.602 --> 52:17.870
What's the matter?

52:17.970 --> 52:19.970
Ask him.

52:21.140 --> 52:23.140
Sto-lu.

52:23.509 --> 52:24.944
Sto-lu.

52:25.044 --> 52:28.346
Sto-lu botu ahm.

52:28.414 --> 52:30.415
Ahm Bo-lu.

52:30.483 --> 52:32.218
I think he's saying that a Bo-lu...

52:32.318 --> 52:33.686
...can't go beyond this point.

52:33.786 --> 52:36.087
Yes. And this marks...

52:36.155 --> 52:38.960
...the boundary of his territory.

52:38.991 --> 52:40.025
Family tree.

52:40.125 --> 52:42.125
Ahm...

52:43.696 --> 52:45.696
Dietz. Come on.

54:30.235 --> 54:32.235
Ugh.

54:33.506 --> 54:35.506
Sto-lu. Aah.

54:49.188 --> 54:50.623
Aah.

54:50.723 --> 54:52.723
Ugh.

55:24.990 --> 55:27.959
Quite right, miss Clayton.

55:28.026 --> 55:30.896
Yes, he's different from the Bo-lu.

55:30.996 --> 55:34.432
His species is more advanced.

55:34.500 --> 55:36.068
Sto-lu.

55:36.168 --> 55:38.536
Sto-lu.

55:38.604 --> 55:41.272
Ahm Bo-lu.

55:41.340 --> 55:43.340
Bo-lu.

55:58.524 --> 55:59.592
Bo-lu.

55:59.692 --> 56:02.159
Ahm Bo-lu.

56:07.332 --> 56:10.568
Ahm sto-lu.

56:10.636 --> 56:12.637
Sto-lu.

56:12.705 --> 56:15.680
He's saying that he'll be a sto-lu.

56:22.381 --> 56:25.182
Ahm ga-lu.

56:25.250 --> 56:27.285
Lisa.

56:28.954 --> 56:30.022
Ga-lu.

56:30.122 --> 56:34.025
I think ahm believes that one day...

56:34.092 --> 56:37.196
...he will become like us
and be known as ga-lu.

56:37.296 --> 56:40.533
It's not an uncommon belief
that the soul of the dead...

56:40.633 --> 56:44.169
...is reincarnated, each
time on a higher level.

56:44.269 --> 56:48.434
No, he thinks he will
actually change, physically.

56:49.207 --> 56:52.844
No, no. No, that's impossible.

57:23.825 --> 57:25.961
Perhaps it's just marsh gas.

57:26.061 --> 57:28.129
No. No, it's oil.

57:28.196 --> 57:29.998
Oil.

57:30.098 --> 57:32.098
Oil.

59:10.966 --> 59:13.502
Bradley, get everyone
back to the submarine.

59:13.602 --> 59:15.103
Man the gun.

59:15.203 --> 59:17.203
Go on, ahm.

01:01:16.024 --> 01:01:18.058
Borg, fire two rounds.

01:01:21.630 --> 01:01:22.698
Can you see anybody?

01:01:22.798 --> 01:01:24.798
Yes, they're watching.

01:01:26.502 --> 01:01:28.502
Get out.

01:01:31.006 --> 01:01:32.908
Your Mr. Bradley is taking his time.

01:01:33.008 --> 01:01:34.777
Shh. Don't worry about Mr. Bradley,

01:01:34.877 --> 01:01:37.852
just keep an eye on those monsters.

01:01:41.216 --> 01:01:43.450
'Use searchlight...'

01:01:43.519 --> 01:01:45.387
Give me the searchlight.

01:01:45.487 --> 01:01:48.122
'Watch for...Mr. Tyler.'

01:02:53.689 --> 01:02:57.392
It's a styracosaurus of
the cretaceous group.

01:02:57.492 --> 01:03:01.029
You know, there is a secret to this island,

01:03:01.129 --> 01:03:04.633
something that we haven't
been able to fathom yet,

01:03:04.733 --> 01:03:07.268
and whether we stay or get away...

01:03:07.368 --> 01:03:09.368
...may depend on it.

01:03:23.384 --> 01:03:24.620
Come.

01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:26.720
Ahm. Ja.

01:03:30.358 --> 01:03:32.861
Nein, ahm.  Nein, nein. ...

01:03:32.961 --> 01:03:35.936
...Nein, nein,  nein, nein.

01:03:51.647 --> 01:03:54.716
It's the same in the microscopic world.

01:03:54.816 --> 01:03:58.319
Creatures at every stage
of evolutionary development.

01:03:58.419 --> 01:04:01.356
The same with the men,
the same with the animals.

01:04:01.456 --> 01:04:06.627
Millions of years of evolution
embraced on this island.

01:04:20.575 --> 01:04:22.644
Von schoenvorts  was right. ...

01:04:22.744 --> 01:04:24.746
...The creatures of caprona
 were like those...

01:04:24.846 --> 01:04:27.849
...that existed  in prehistoric times. ...

01:04:27.949 --> 01:04:30.418
...And the further we
followed the river north,

01:04:30.518 --> 01:04:34.513
the more highly-developed
 they became.

01:04:56.812 --> 01:04:58.346
Yes.

01:04:58.446 --> 01:04:59.781
What do you make of it?

01:04:59.881 --> 01:05:03.650
Well, the further we go upstream...

01:05:03.719 --> 01:05:05.386
...the fewer the organisms there are...

01:05:05.486 --> 01:05:07.486
...and the simpler.

01:05:15.997 --> 01:05:17.365
Well done, Mr. Bradley.

01:05:17.465 --> 01:05:19.590
Let's just hope it works.

01:05:19.601 --> 01:05:22.069
So do I, Mr. Tyler.

01:05:22.137 --> 01:05:24.239
Ready, Mr. borg? Ready, Mr. Bradley.

01:05:24.339 --> 01:05:25.807
Sinclair, start pumping.

01:05:25.907 --> 01:05:27.907
Well done.

01:05:34.382 --> 01:05:35.784
Well done, Mr. borg.

01:05:35.884 --> 01:05:37.884
Very good.

01:05:42.224 --> 01:05:44.258
Excellent.

01:05:44.325 --> 01:05:46.365
Look at that. Excellent.

01:06:14.956 --> 01:06:16.524
You know, it could be more difficult...

01:06:16.624 --> 01:06:20.024
...to leave caprona than it was to land.

01:06:21.629 --> 01:06:23.131
We'll have that current with us...

01:06:23.231 --> 01:06:25.951
...going out through the tunnel.

01:06:26.301 --> 01:06:28.369
It'll be very difficult to navigate.

01:06:28.469 --> 01:06:31.639
Kapitaen Von schoenvorts
will take us through.

01:06:31.739 --> 01:06:33.809
I was with him when he took our u-33...

01:06:33.909 --> 01:06:35.376
...down the Norwegian coast in winter...

01:06:35.476 --> 01:06:38.879
...to sink a British cruiser.

01:06:38.947 --> 01:06:42.177
Storms and ice flows did not stop him.

01:06:42.317 --> 01:06:43.384
He's not very good...

01:06:43.484 --> 01:06:46.544
...against lifeboats, though, is he?

01:07:35.337 --> 01:07:37.404
Punch him.

01:07:39.074 --> 01:07:41.575
Punch him. Punch him.

01:07:41.642 --> 01:07:43.642
Ooh.

01:07:50.185 --> 01:07:51.452
Hey. Dietz. Hey. Hey.

01:07:51.552 --> 01:07:53.552
Hey.

01:08:01.863 --> 01:08:03.863
Belt him, Olson.

01:08:17.511 --> 01:08:19.281
Do you want to remain on this island...

01:08:19.381 --> 01:08:21.845
...for the rest of your life?

01:08:26.154 --> 01:08:28.822
We must work all together.

01:08:34.194 --> 01:08:35.863
Those two won't.

01:08:35.964 --> 01:08:38.966
Then we must keep them apart.

01:08:39.033 --> 01:08:40.568
Mr. Tyler, I suggest...

01:08:40.667 --> 01:08:42.871
...that we divide the men into groups,

01:08:42.970 --> 01:08:46.006
and each group takes turns...

01:08:46.073 --> 01:08:49.209
...hunting, building, refining.

01:08:49.277 --> 01:08:50.511
Good idea.

01:08:50.611 --> 01:08:53.381
They're just blowin' off a little steam, Lisa.

01:08:53.481 --> 01:08:57.151
Well, ahm, we'll be going home soon.

01:08:57.218 --> 01:08:58.920
Ship, ship.

01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:00.020
Ship?

01:09:00.121 --> 01:09:02.288
Going home. Ship.

01:09:02.357 --> 01:09:05.091
Submarine.

01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:07.160
Ga-lu.

01:09:07.694 --> 01:09:09.694
Ga-lu.

01:09:11.599 --> 01:09:13.068
Botu.

01:09:13.167 --> 01:09:14.336
'Botu,' I know what that--...

01:09:14.435 --> 01:09:16.203
...yeah, I know, I know.

01:09:16.304 --> 01:09:18.304
That means death.

01:09:49.304 --> 01:09:51.304
Where's our friend ahm?

01:09:52.407 --> 01:09:54.841
He usually eats with us.

01:09:54.909 --> 01:09:56.244
Ahm.

01:09:56.344 --> 01:09:58.344
Miss Clayton.

01:10:37.452 --> 01:10:40.322
Well, it's your turn today, huh, Mr. Tyler.

01:10:40.422 --> 01:10:41.489
How many more barrels...

01:10:41.589 --> 01:10:43.124
...do we need, captain Von schoenvorts?

01:10:43.224 --> 01:10:45.827
Oh, I would say another day might do it.

01:10:45.927 --> 01:10:49.563
This might be your last hunt.

01:10:49.630 --> 01:10:52.860
Auf wiedersehen.  Wiedersehen.

01:11:27.635 --> 01:11:29.137
Each time we've had to go further...

01:11:29.237 --> 01:11:30.738
...and further north to find game.

01:11:30.838 --> 01:11:32.374
That's exactly why I came.

01:11:32.474 --> 01:11:33.608
I think we're getting nearer...

01:11:33.708 --> 01:11:35.276
...the source of life on caprona.

01:11:35.376 --> 01:11:38.351
Lisa, this might be your lucky day.

01:12:03.371 --> 01:12:05.496
It's a sto-lu encampment.

01:12:14.282 --> 01:12:16.583
Hey, look--...

01:12:16.651 --> 01:12:19.387
...look at the women in that pool.

01:12:19.487 --> 01:12:20.688
What are they doing?

01:12:20.788 --> 01:12:22.223
Do you remember those samples...

01:12:22.323 --> 01:12:23.591
...we took from the river?

01:12:23.691 --> 01:12:24.892
Yeah.

01:12:24.992 --> 01:12:27.395
And the spawn we looked at
under the microscope?

01:12:27.495 --> 01:12:30.895
This must be how life begins on caprona.

01:12:30.931 --> 01:12:32.767
That's the secret.

01:12:32.867 --> 01:12:35.603
Every creature must lay eggs in this way.

01:12:35.703 --> 01:12:37.072
They flow into the river...

01:12:37.172 --> 01:12:39.907
...and develop through
every stage of evolution.

01:12:40.007 --> 01:12:42.077
Again and again a time must come...

01:12:42.177 --> 01:12:44.112
...when they must go forward.

01:12:44.212 --> 01:12:47.272
Nothing on caprona can ever go back.

01:12:51.653 --> 01:12:53.753
Mr. Tyler. Aah.

01:13:08.570 --> 01:13:10.570
Come on.

01:14:01.055 --> 01:14:02.557
I'm gonna draw them away from us.

01:14:02.657 --> 01:14:04.657
Now, stay here.

01:14:18.306 --> 01:14:20.306
Botu.

01:14:51.172 --> 01:14:53.172
Aah.

01:15:18.666 --> 01:15:20.666
Ahm.

01:15:22.303 --> 01:15:24.303
Ahm, no.

01:15:43.825 --> 01:15:47.126
Ahm, look out.

01:15:49.397 --> 01:15:51.397
Aah.

01:18:33.661 --> 01:18:35.195
Kapitaen, the last barrel has been filled,

01:18:35.295 --> 01:18:37.498
and we have a stock of
food and water aboard.

01:18:37.598 --> 01:18:39.934
May I request permission
to withdraw from the stockade...

01:18:40.034 --> 01:18:41.536
...and rejoin with the u-33?

01:18:41.636 --> 01:18:43.838
But Mr. Tyler and the others aren't back yet.

01:18:43.938 --> 01:18:46.828
So? We're better off without them.

01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:27.815
Aah.

01:19:27.915 --> 01:19:29.915
Aah.

01:20:44.058 --> 01:20:45.359
We cannot wait any longer, kapitaen.

01:20:45.459 --> 01:20:48.519
At least let us get aboard the ship.

01:20:48.729 --> 01:20:50.729
Very well, Dietz.

01:21:00.174 --> 01:21:02.542
They must be ga-lu.

01:21:03.610 --> 01:21:05.610
Ga-lu?

01:21:06.881 --> 01:21:09.549
We... We ga-lu.

01:21:10.651 --> 01:21:12.651
Botu.

01:21:14.822 --> 01:21:16.822
Aah.

01:21:21.962 --> 01:21:23.962
Aah.

01:22:09.243 --> 01:22:11.243
Aah.

01:22:12.980 --> 01:22:14.980
Lisa.

01:22:49.449 --> 01:22:50.851
Bradley.

01:22:50.951 --> 01:22:52.951
Von schoenvorts.

01:23:37.164 --> 01:23:38.899
How much longer do we give them?

01:23:38.999 --> 01:23:40.999
As long as we have to.

01:24:11.098 --> 01:24:13.033
I don't like the look of the lake, kapitaen.

01:24:13.133 --> 01:24:14.168
It's getting worse every minute.

01:24:14.268 --> 01:24:15.569
If we stay here much longer--...

01:24:15.669 --> 01:24:17.437
...we're not leaving without them.

01:24:17.537 --> 01:24:19.537
Look out, skipper.

01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:22.009
Don't be a fool, Dietz.

01:24:22.109 --> 01:24:24.109
Aah.

01:24:25.246 --> 01:24:27.246
Get them below.

01:24:29.316 --> 01:24:31.550
Slow ahead both engines.

01:24:54.108 --> 01:24:56.108
Leaving?

01:24:56.944 --> 01:24:58.944
We are leaving?.

01:25:13.693 --> 01:25:14.761
Bradley.

01:25:14.861 --> 01:25:16.861
Von schoenvorts.

01:25:19.733 --> 01:25:21.773
Give me the searchlight.

01:25:22.202 --> 01:25:24.202
You cannot.

01:25:31.445 --> 01:25:33.445
Dietz.

01:25:43.324 --> 01:25:46.059
Von schoenvorts, wait.

01:25:46.126 --> 01:25:47.962
Wait. Help.

01:25:48.062 --> 01:25:50.063
No.

01:25:50.130 --> 01:25:51.866
Good-bye, miss Lisa.

01:25:51.966 --> 01:25:53.667
Wait. Dietz.

01:25:53.767 --> 01:25:55.767
Bradley.

01:26:02.609 --> 01:26:04.609
Von schoenvorts.

01:26:05.446 --> 01:26:07.446
Dietz.

01:26:08.148 --> 01:26:10.383
Wiedersehen, Mr. Tyler.

01:26:10.451 --> 01:26:11.986
Wiedersehen.

01:26:12.086 --> 01:26:14.420
Stop. Dietz.

01:26:14.488 --> 01:26:16.990
Wait.

01:26:17.057 --> 01:26:18.558
Wait. Stop.

01:26:18.658 --> 01:26:20.027
Von schoenvorts.

01:26:20.127 --> 01:26:22.062
I hope you enjoy your stay.

01:26:22.162 --> 01:26:24.162
Von schoenvorts. Stop.

01:26:35.175 --> 01:26:39.112
It's too late. It's all too late.

01:26:39.179 --> 01:26:41.481
Submerge. Dive. Dive. Dive.

01:26:43.750 --> 01:26:46.719
We cannot breathe.

01:26:46.786 --> 01:26:49.506
The heat, the smoke-- get below.

01:26:54.495 --> 01:26:56.862
Dive. Dive. Dive. Borg.

01:26:58.832 --> 01:27:02.101
I told you to submerge.

01:27:02.169 --> 01:27:04.169
Get back to your post.

01:27:41.975 --> 01:27:45.978
It's all too late. Caprona has won.

01:27:49.015 --> 01:27:51.015
You cannot go back...

01:27:52.152 --> 01:27:54.152
...to the...

01:27:54.588 --> 01:27:56.722
...beginning.

01:29:18.338 --> 01:29:19.873
With the sinking  of
the submarine, ...

01:29:19.973 --> 01:29:21.808
...all our hopes  of getting
away from caprona...

01:29:21.908 --> 01:29:23.908
...have disappeared.

01:29:23.910 --> 01:29:25.612
We are alone...

01:29:25.712 --> 01:29:29.183
...Spurned by even  the
highest--the ga-lu. ...

01:29:29.283 --> 01:29:32.519
...So we have to go on
in the way of caprona...

01:29:32.619 --> 01:29:35.188
...till we find peace.

01:29:37.791 --> 01:29:39.326
I would rather  live here with Lisa...

01:29:39.426 --> 01:29:42.329
...than to live elsewhere
 without her. ...

01:29:42.429 --> 01:29:45.064
...And she says the same of me.

01:29:46.333 --> 01:29:49.636
If God wills it,
we shall live our lives here.

01:29:49.736 --> 01:29:51.271
However,  we are determined...

01:29:51.371 --> 01:29:54.808
...to move ever northward,
 ever forward, ...

01:29:54.908 --> 01:29:57.611
...toward the greater mysteries
 that lie ahead

01:29:57.711 --> 01:30:01.414
of this land that time forgot.
