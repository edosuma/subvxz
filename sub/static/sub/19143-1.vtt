Fifteen years
in a wheelchair

02:30.775 --> 02:32.145
and she rose up.

02:32.193 --> 02:34.783
Rose up by the power

02:34.821 --> 02:36.491
By the spirit

02:36.531 --> 02:39.411
Oh, the spirit, the spirit,
the spirit.

Oh, the spirit

02:43.872 --> 02:45.792
Hector,
you are being released.

02:45.832 --> 02:47.752
Your foot is being released

Glory to him!

03:03.183 --> 03:04.743
There is an anointing
on this house tonight.

03:04.767 --> 03:06.767
- Dean.
- Welcome.

03:06.811 --> 03:10.311
I'm so glad
that you're here.

03:10.356 --> 03:11.917
Did you have any trouble
finding it or anything?

03:11.941 --> 03:14.781
- No. No.
- Oh, I'm so happy you came.

03:14.819 --> 03:17.149
He was just talking
about... oh, wait.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.465
Shh shh.
- Beg the Lord to touch you.

03:18.489 --> 03:20.619
- Ask him now
while the holy spirit

03:20.658 --> 03:22.578
is overflowing in this room.

03:22.619 --> 03:25.499
Say to him,
"Lord, I don't want it anymore."

03:25.538 --> 03:26.578
- I don't want it anymore.

03:26.623 --> 03:27.923
- "You take the pain."

03:27.957 --> 03:29.457
- You take the pain.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.500
- "I am yours.
Wash me clean."

03:31.544 --> 03:33.554
- I am yours, wash me.
Say it, Dean.

03:33.588 --> 03:36.548
- I can't live the Christian
life without you Lord!

03:36.591 --> 03:40.801
I need you to live your life
through me!

03:40.845 --> 03:43.925
There's a young man.
He's duly infirmed.

03:43.973 --> 03:46.183
- Could be you, Dean.
- He's not a believer.

03:46.226 --> 03:49.346
He's not one of us.
He came here out of desperation.

03:49.395 --> 03:52.855
You're in pain.
You're in hell.

03:52.899 --> 03:55.479
You don't even know
why you came

03:55.526 --> 03:59.526
or even if you should have,
but you are welcome.

03:59.572 --> 04:01.717
Now I'm going to point you out.
I'm going to point you out.

04:01.741 --> 04:04.871
This hand is being guided

04:04.911 --> 04:06.451
You're over here.

04:06.496 --> 04:07.956
Don't be afraid.
Don't be frightened.

04:07.997 --> 04:10.327
He's calling you.
He's healing you.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.705
The Lord is healing you
right there.

04:12.752 --> 04:14.230
- It's you Dean.
- You are being called.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.397
- He's pointing at you.
- You mean me?

04:15.421 --> 04:16.711
- You are being healed
right now.

04:16.755 --> 04:18.233
- Yeah, stand up.
- Stand and receive it.

04:18.257 --> 04:19.757
- Stand up.
- Stand and receive it.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.237
You are being called.
- Come on, Dean.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.551
This is your time.
This is it.

04:22.595 --> 04:23.715
- Stand up.
- You can do it.

04:23.763 --> 04:27.473
- Stand up
and claim your healing.

04:27.517 --> 04:29.347
You have heart disease
and your name is Jerry.

04:29.394 --> 04:32.234
- What?
- It's me.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.812
- I'm Jerry.
Jerry, that's me.

04:33.856 --> 04:37.316
- It's me. He said me.
- No. That was me!

04:37.360 --> 04:38.740
- Rejoice. Rejoice.

04:38.778 --> 04:41.778
- Aaaah!

04:44.284 --> 04:46.744
Fuck!

06:28.388 --> 06:29.848
- Can I bum a smoke?

06:29.889 --> 06:32.889
Brendel?

06:32.934 --> 06:35.604
- Ah, there you go.
Thank you, my good man.

06:35.645 --> 06:38.015
I'll give you
an old carton right here.

06:38.064 --> 06:42.034
Yeah, man.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.778
What the hell
is that, brendel?

06:44.821 --> 06:46.531
You got a fever
or something, man?

07:06.426 --> 07:08.136
- There he is.

07:08.177 --> 07:12.557
You look
like you got some rest.

07:12.598 --> 07:13.598
Good, good.

07:13.641 --> 07:17.061
Good morning, harv.

07:17.103 --> 07:19.693
Eggs?
- Yeah, I'm not an asshole.

07:19.730 --> 07:21.400
Get me fired?

07:21.441 --> 07:23.731
- Harv, I didn't get you fired,
remember?

07:23.776 --> 07:26.736
It was your heart.
It's the old ticker, harv.

07:26.779 --> 07:28.659
- Promised me you'll help me.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.868
- I did help you harv.
I get your medicine, remember?

07:30.908 --> 07:34.078
I feed you.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.790
Make sure you see the nurse,
okay?

07:36.831 --> 07:39.961
Dean.
- What's up, padre?

07:40.001 --> 07:41.751
When are you going
to get me into an sro?

07:41.794 --> 07:44.094
I need a bed.
- Stick around.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.774
I got some forms for you
to fill out, all right?

07:45.798 --> 07:49.628
I might have something
for you.

07:49.677 --> 07:54.927
Good to see you.

07:54.974 --> 07:57.434
I have the del vista
assisted living center.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.937
I talked to the guy today

07:58.978 --> 08:00.698
and he's ready
to take you anytime you want.

08:00.730 --> 08:02.124
So you can get out of here.
- No way.

08:02.148 --> 08:03.908
That's a fucking
nursing home, padre. No way.

08:03.941 --> 08:05.002
- It's not a nursing home,
Dean.

08:05.026 --> 08:06.526
- Look,
they have apartments.

08:06.569 --> 08:07.963
They have apartments
for the handicapped.

08:07.987 --> 08:09.214
- I'm not ending up like that.
No way.

08:09.238 --> 08:10.528
- You're not ending up
like what?

08:10.573 --> 08:11.823
- Like that.

08:11.866 --> 08:13.051
- You don't have
to be down here, Dean.

08:13.075 --> 08:14.615
- I eat down here.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.221
- Every time I see you,
you ask me for an sro.

08:16.245 --> 08:18.125
You're down here,
and you're living in your car,

08:18.164 --> 08:19.975
and you don't have to, Dean...
That's your reality.

08:19.999 --> 08:21.959
Now fill this out.
And medical is in the back.

08:22.001 --> 08:23.501
Do something
to help yourself.

08:23.544 --> 08:24.980
There's only so much
I can do for you.

08:25.004 --> 08:26.004
- Dean.

08:26.214 --> 08:27.964
Dean, I know
you were disappointed,

08:28.007 --> 08:29.837
but did you feel
the Lord's anointing

08:29.884 --> 08:31.014
in the room?

08:31.052 --> 08:32.552
He was there.
- Yeah, yeah.

08:32.595 --> 08:34.595
I'm polishing my tap shoes,
Rene.

08:34.639 --> 08:35.808
- Don't give up, Dean.

08:35.847 --> 08:37.034
You just... you have
to be patient.

08:37.058 --> 08:38.558
You just have
to keep showing up.

08:38.601 --> 08:40.120
Remember that God's time
isn't our time,

08:40.144 --> 08:41.984
but he is always on time.
Amen.

08:42.020 --> 08:43.900
- That's fucking profound.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.959
- You know, it's only when
you're fully open to Jesus...

08:45.983 --> 08:49.993
- I'm not open! I'm closed.
I'm closed for business, Rene.

08:50.029 --> 08:51.548
So take your fucking
collection plate...

08:53.699 --> 08:56.989
Hey! Hey!

08:57.036 --> 08:58.616
Hey, that's my shit.

08:58.663 --> 09:00.663
Come here!
- Dean, let him go!

09:00.706 --> 09:02.059
No, no, no, no, no.
Let him go. Let him go.

09:02.083 --> 09:04.003
- Hey! Come here!

09:04.043 --> 09:06.003
Come back here!
- Dean, let him go!

09:06.045 --> 09:07.665
Let him go. Let him go.
- Hey!

09:07.713 --> 09:09.513
- Dean, let him go.
- Fuck!

09:09.549 --> 09:11.589
- Let him go.
- Fuck! Motherfucker!

09:11.634 --> 09:13.224
- Hey, those are Dean's.

09:13.261 --> 09:16.181
That belongs to Dean.
Give that back to him.

09:16.222 --> 09:17.642
That's it.
That's enough.

09:17.682 --> 09:19.062
This is what
I'm talking about.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.619
This is why I don't want you
parking here.

09:20.643 --> 09:23.733
I want you
to fill those forms out, Dean.

09:23.771 --> 09:26.861
- Dean. Are you all right?
- Yeah.

09:26.899 --> 09:28.569
- I got... I got your shoe.

09:28.609 --> 09:30.859
Dean, I know that God feels
a million miles away

09:30.903 --> 09:32.283
right now, okay?

09:32.321 --> 09:34.201
I know what that feels like.
I've been there.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.700
I've been there myself.

09:35.741 --> 09:37.219
But this is the time
when you have to believe

09:37.243 --> 09:38.203
more than anything.

09:38.244 --> 09:39.744
This is the time

09:39.787 --> 09:41.181
when you have to be open
in your heart to Jesus

09:41.205 --> 09:42.745
and he will come.

09:42.790 --> 09:44.620
- You really
think you're going to get up

09:44.667 --> 09:45.627
and walk one day, Rene?

09:45.668 --> 09:46.918
You really believe that?

09:46.961 --> 09:50.171
- Yes, I do.

10:02.810 --> 10:04.600
- Guy's a fucking idiot.

10:04.645 --> 10:07.555
- He's just trying to help.

10:07.607 --> 10:10.687
- What am I going to do?
Like, I know...

10:16.657 --> 10:19.867
Life's bullshit, man.

10:19.910 --> 10:21.620
There's no way out.

10:21.662 --> 10:22.912
- There is a way out,

10:22.955 --> 10:25.615
but you're gonna have
to find it.

11:07.708 --> 11:10.748
- All right, let's give it up
for dj shy.

11:10.795 --> 11:12.295
So there's one more.

11:12.338 --> 11:15.798
- Hey, dj shy,
that was tight.

11:15.841 --> 11:17.881
My band is auditioning
DJs tomorrow.

11:17.927 --> 11:19.717
I would love
to check you out.

11:19.762 --> 11:23.102
- Let's give it up
for dj "delicious" Dean.

11:59.218 --> 12:01.138
- Oh, no, why'd you stop?

12:01.178 --> 12:03.428
That was so gutter, man.
Keep going.

12:03.472 --> 12:07.352
- L-i can't.
The... the table's too high.

12:07.393 --> 12:10.443
- Oh, shit.
Well, I'll fix that.

12:10.479 --> 12:12.189
- No, no, no.
Don't worry about it.

12:12.231 --> 12:14.441
I was just messing around.
Leave it. You can leave it.

12:14.483 --> 12:17.743
- Just get that side.
- Wait. Whoa whoa whoa.

12:17.778 --> 12:19.381
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, don't touch that.

12:19.405 --> 12:20.924
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

12:20.948 --> 12:21.988
- Lowering the table.

12:22.032 --> 12:23.452
- Could you put it back,
please?

12:23.492 --> 12:25.095
- I'm helping my friend.
- Oh, you're help...

12:25.119 --> 12:26.179
- Will you lower it
on that side?

12:26.203 --> 12:27.373
- I'm not gonna touch it.

12:27.413 --> 12:28.765
Take your hands off it
and put it back.

12:28.789 --> 12:29.959
These desks are set

12:29.999 --> 12:31.143
at regulation height,
all right?

12:31.167 --> 12:32.787
This is for DJs
that could stand.

12:32.835 --> 12:35.035
- Don't go there, man.
That's so uncool.

12:35.087 --> 12:36.727
He's the best thing
we've heard all night.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.206
Why don't you just give him
a chance?

12:38.257 --> 12:40.427
- This is his chance, okay?
I'm sorry.

12:40.468 --> 12:42.798
- You know, your bar
is not accessible.

12:42.845 --> 12:44.465
I could totally report
your ass.

12:44.513 --> 12:46.241
- Why don't you take it up
with lemmy, all right?

12:46.265 --> 12:48.076
I don't own the place.
- I'm supporting talent.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.350
Who you supporting?

12:49.393 --> 12:52.153
The fucking fuck head committee
of fucks?

12:52.188 --> 12:55.018
- Good night. Thank you.
Don't come back.

12:55.065 --> 12:57.355
- Delicious,
wait, wait, wait.

12:57.401 --> 13:01.031
That guy in there
was a jackass!

13:01.071 --> 13:02.071
Check it out.

13:02.114 --> 13:03.824
I have a band

13:03.866 --> 13:09.496
and I really want you
to come jam with us tomorrow.

13:09.538 --> 13:12.788
- Well, I don't play
with bands.

13:12.833 --> 13:14.753
- Bullshit.

13:14.794 --> 13:17.884
Only on the snyde diver remix
and the indie fatigable

13:17.922 --> 13:22.972
scratch clowns for a year?

13:23.010 --> 13:25.260
You are
that delicious d, right?

13:25.304 --> 13:29.894
Or is there...
Is there another one?

13:29.934 --> 13:34.154
- Yeah.
It's another guy.

13:34.188 --> 13:38.018
- I know I'm going
to see you tomorrow.

14:13.978 --> 14:15.978
- Brendel?

14:20.860 --> 14:22.150
Brendel.

14:25.906 --> 14:29.826
Brendel?

14:29.869 --> 14:31.304
- Oh, I was trying to get
to inglewood.

14:31.328 --> 14:33.078
I'm just feeling
a little bit lost.

14:33.122 --> 14:37.082
Can you give me a hand?

14:37.126 --> 14:40.036
- I'm... I'm... I'm just trying
to get to inglewood.

14:40.087 --> 14:42.507
- You... you don't know me?

14:42.548 --> 14:46.218
- I can't say I do.

14:46.260 --> 14:48.220
- Let's get you
where you need to go.

14:48.262 --> 14:51.562
Come on. Come on here.
This way.

15:10.242 --> 15:12.912
- That's beside the point.
The guy's got no soul.

15:12.953 --> 15:15.963
We need somebody
with a groove.

15:15.998 --> 15:17.458
- I'm just saying.
- Oh, that's good.

15:17.499 --> 15:19.379
Let's just hire a dude
because he's your...

15:19.418 --> 15:22.628
Hey,
what are you doing here?

15:22.671 --> 15:24.881
- I came to audition.
- Who are you?

15:24.924 --> 15:26.884
- That's delicious d.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.046
He's won like seven
scratch battles.

15:29.094 --> 15:32.184
He used to play at razy
overclimb's every Friday.

15:32.222 --> 15:33.392
- Shit, man. No.

15:33.432 --> 15:35.222
I heard of delicious d.
Dude, fuck.

15:35.267 --> 15:37.387
You scratched
on the ball shred remix

15:37.436 --> 15:38.646
for snyde diver.

15:38.687 --> 15:40.557
- Scratched and mixed.
Yeah.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.066
- Hold on, man.

15:42.107 --> 15:43.567
You're not even on the list,
are you?

15:43.609 --> 15:45.189
- He's on my list.

15:45.235 --> 15:47.065
And he's going to play
because he rocks.

15:47.112 --> 15:50.912
- The stain,
we need you, man.

16:01.126 --> 16:05.956
- A herald for the infirm.

16:06.006 --> 16:09.126
- This is the stain.
This is delicious d.

16:09.176 --> 16:11.636
He played
on snyde diver's record.

16:11.679 --> 16:13.679
- Snyde?

16:13.722 --> 16:15.602
- You want
to hear me solo first

16:15.641 --> 16:16.601
or you guys just want
to jam?

16:16.642 --> 16:18.562
What do you want to do?

16:41.166 --> 16:43.206
- Shut the fuck up!
What the fuck is that?

16:43.252 --> 16:45.292
What have I told you
about the fucking phaser?

16:45.337 --> 16:47.707
- Guys, guys...
Guys. Oogie!

16:47.756 --> 16:51.376
I'm sorry.
Where's the hook?

16:51.427 --> 16:53.967
Where's the melody?
- Where's the melody?

16:54.013 --> 16:55.991
What fucking melody?
We never talked about a melody.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.305
- We were keeping it
free form.

16:57.349 --> 17:00.349
There is a place for...
- Fuck the melody!

17:00.394 --> 17:02.024
We're antl-melody.

17:02.062 --> 17:04.192
- You know, we are still,
like, discovering

17:04.231 --> 17:07.651
what it is that it is
that it's going to be.

17:07.693 --> 17:09.153
- Oh, for fuck's sake.

17:09.194 --> 17:11.614
- Nina, we are not doing
some corporate gig

17:11.655 --> 17:13.605
with our tunes
just to get signed.

17:13.656 --> 17:18.487
- We have a&r people coming.
It has to be accessible.

17:18.537 --> 17:21.707
- This has to be a full,
multilayered barrage

17:21.749 --> 17:22.999
to the senses.

17:23.041 --> 17:24.462
- And this is a gimmick.

17:24.501 --> 17:27.001
- Well, take your suit ears off
for a sec, hon.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.165
It's fucking cool.

17:28.213 --> 17:30.093
- Who is this guy?

17:30.132 --> 17:31.672
And can we get a real dj
in here?

17:31.717 --> 17:34.047
- Hey, fuck you, bitch.
- Shut the fuck up, man.

17:34.094 --> 17:35.344
- You fucking stupid...
- Oi!

17:35.387 --> 17:37.427
- You're auditioning,
you fuck!

17:44.563 --> 17:46.063
- I'll be in touch.

17:46.106 --> 17:49.776
- Nina, Nina.

17:51.236 --> 17:52.646
Get sonica.

17:52.696 --> 17:54.276
- That was smart.

17:54.323 --> 17:55.800
- What the fuck are we supposed
to do with you?

17:55.824 --> 17:59.744
- Douche bag.
- What the fuck is that?

18:02.748 --> 18:05.668
- Hello, Dean.

18:05.709 --> 18:07.749
Do you have a minute?

18:07.795 --> 18:09.705
- My man, my man.

18:09.755 --> 18:11.545
Father, this is him.
- Really?

18:11.590 --> 18:13.050
- This is the man.
He's the one.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.382
Look, young un,
you raised me up.

18:15.427 --> 18:18.677
- Brendel's had
a spontaneous healing, Dean,

18:18.722 --> 18:21.312
of his... of his gout
and his Alzheimer's.

18:21.350 --> 18:23.140
- What are you
talking about, man? What...?

18:24.770 --> 18:28.190
- I don't know what this is.,
listen, please.

18:28.232 --> 18:30.652
I mean, you don't know
what you did.

18:30.692 --> 18:33.652
My man, look, you got
the healing touch.

18:33.695 --> 18:35.565
- I got nothing
to do with you, man.

18:35.614 --> 18:38.414
- I want to thank you.
No, I want to thank you.

18:38.450 --> 18:40.120
- I got nothing to do
with you!

18:40.160 --> 18:42.200
I didn't do anything.
- Okay.

18:42.246 --> 18:44.406
All right.
Let's break it up here.

18:44.456 --> 18:45.786
There's nothing to see.

18:45.833 --> 18:48.503
Dean had nothing
to do with this.

18:51.672 --> 18:53.712
Dean?

19:13.527 --> 19:15.380
So you're one of these guys
who has, like, a huge chip

19:15.404 --> 19:17.364
on their shoulder
and thinks they can go around

19:17.406 --> 19:19.276
and get mad
at whoever they want,

19:19.324 --> 19:20.284
whenever they want?

19:20.325 --> 19:23.445
- No. No.

19:23.495 --> 19:28.115
- That was really fucked up
the way you talked to Nina.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.747
I mean, because like it or not,
she does shit for our band.

19:30.794 --> 19:33.304
And, you know...

19:33.338 --> 19:34.649
- I shouldn't have done it,
Ariel.

19:34.673 --> 19:35.803
I said that, okay?

19:35.841 --> 19:37.801
- I mean, I want you
in the band.

19:37.843 --> 19:39.183
I really do, Dean.

19:39.219 --> 19:41.349
And I think
you have something

19:41.388 --> 19:43.558
that's really amazing.

19:43.599 --> 19:47.599
But you'd have to learn
how to navigate your,

19:47.644 --> 19:51.524
you know, your hostilities
and shit.

19:51.565 --> 19:53.315
'Cause we have so much shit
coming up

19:53.358 --> 19:55.295
and you can't just be, like,
flying off the handle.

19:55.319 --> 19:59.819
I mean, we're gonna get signed
and we're gonna play out

19:59.865 --> 20:01.485
and do amazing things.

20:01.533 --> 20:03.163
- I can do it.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.470
- I don't know
if you'd be ready for it.

20:04.494 --> 20:07.874
- I will not fuck it up.

20:07.915 --> 20:11.495
- I like pain killers.
Do you mind?

20:11.543 --> 20:13.213
- No.

20:21.595 --> 20:23.345
- I don't think
I heard you say sorry.

20:23.388 --> 20:26.768
- Ariel, I'm sorry.

20:29.728 --> 20:32.438
- Okay.

20:32.481 --> 20:35.901
I could talk to the stain.

20:35.943 --> 20:37.363
You know,
I have a way with him

20:37.402 --> 20:42.532
and he respects my opinion.

20:42.574 --> 20:44.954
- Wh... are you serious?

20:44.993 --> 20:46.703
- Yeah.

20:46.745 --> 20:52.375
Show up at the gig at 9:00
and you can be in the band.

20:52.417 --> 20:54.537
- Just like that?

20:54.586 --> 20:57.256
- Cool.

20:57.297 --> 20:58.877
- Thank you. Thank you.

20:58.924 --> 21:02.264
- Let's drink.

21:02.302 --> 21:04.552
Live it, love it, kill it.

21:36.336 --> 21:37.706
- Hey! Hey!

21:37.754 --> 21:39.023
Hey! What the fuck!
- Be careful.

21:39.047 --> 21:41.007
- Get off me, man.
Let me go! Lay off!

21:41.049 --> 21:42.469
What the fuck!
- Careful.

21:42.509 --> 21:43.879
- What the fuck!
- Get him.

21:43.927 --> 21:46.347
- Get the fuck off!
Ah! Fuck!

21:46.388 --> 21:48.848
Get the fuck off me, man!
Get off! Let go!

21:48.890 --> 21:50.850
- Come here.
- What do you fuckin' want?

21:50.892 --> 21:52.942
What do you want, woman?
What do you want?

21:52.978 --> 21:56.728
- My sight.
I want my sight. Please.

21:56.773 --> 21:58.453
Please, heal me.
I want to see my children.

21:58.483 --> 21:59.919
- What the hell
are you talking about?

21:59.943 --> 22:01.546
Look, I can't heal you.
- Yes, you can do it.

22:01.570 --> 22:02.630
- Look, I don't know
what you...

22:02.654 --> 22:03.904
- You can do it!

22:03.947 --> 22:05.607
- I don't know
what you think I can do.

22:05.657 --> 22:07.677
I can't do anything.
- You can do it. You can do it.

22:07.701 --> 22:08.871
- All right! All right!

22:08.910 --> 22:10.013
Just tell him
to get off of me.

22:10.037 --> 22:12.367
Just get off.
- Let him go.

22:12.414 --> 22:16.924
- This is so fucked up.
This is so fucking stupid.

22:16.960 --> 22:19.500
You got me
on my fuckin' car, man.

22:19.546 --> 22:21.796
- I want to see my children.

22:21.840 --> 22:25.590
Please, my children.

22:25.635 --> 22:28.295
Oh, yes.

22:34.353 --> 22:36.063
Oh, God. Thank you.
Thank you.

22:36.104 --> 22:40.524
Oh. Oh. Oh.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!

22:40.567 --> 22:43.027
- What was that?
Was that Andrew?

22:43.070 --> 22:47.570
- Aaaaaaah!

22:55.374 --> 22:58.004
- What happened?
What happened?

23:02.589 --> 23:04.839
- Is she dead?

23:04.883 --> 23:06.763
- She all right?

23:17.020 --> 23:22.570
- I see.
I see you, father.

23:53.932 --> 23:56.432
- Come on. Come on.

24:10.866 --> 24:15.406
Fuck! Fuck!

24:18.582 --> 24:22.172
- Yo! Yo! Touch me, my man.
- You can heal me, right?

24:22.210 --> 24:24.750
Please. Please. Come on, man.
- Can you heal me?

24:24.796 --> 24:26.416
- Come on, man.
Can't you heal me?

24:26.465 --> 24:28.875
Come on. I know you can.
Please.

24:28.925 --> 24:32.005
Just give me a chance,
man.

24:32.053 --> 24:34.513
- Please help us.

24:39.144 --> 24:40.774
Oh, shit!

24:40.812 --> 24:44.022
What the...?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

24:44.065 --> 24:46.525
L-I just... I was afraid
that things

24:46.568 --> 24:48.028
were going
to get stolen again.

24:48.069 --> 24:49.739
Oh.
- Thanks. Thank you.

24:49.779 --> 24:51.859
- My goodness,
I don't know how you...

24:51.907 --> 24:53.157
How you sleep on this thing.

24:53.200 --> 24:56.160
It's like sleeping
on a board.

24:56.203 --> 25:00.963
Oh. Goodness me.

25:00.999 --> 25:04.169
- Thanks.
- Excuse me.

25:06.254 --> 25:09.924
So did you hear the one
about the blind woman

25:09.966 --> 25:13.926
who was healed by a man
in a wheelchair?

25:16.640 --> 25:19.060
Retinitis pigmentosa.

25:19.100 --> 25:22.230
An incurable disease.
But she's cured.

25:26.858 --> 25:28.108
You really believe that?

25:28.151 --> 25:32.821
I mean you...

25:32.864 --> 25:34.954
People can do that?

25:34.991 --> 25:38.081
- Well, Dean, I-i have never
seen anything like it

25:38.119 --> 25:43.039
in all my days.

25:43.083 --> 25:45.963
- It doesn't work on me.

25:46.002 --> 25:48.842
- Father Joe?
You gonna help me? Huh?

25:48.880 --> 25:51.130
You... father Joe.
- Morning harv.

25:51.174 --> 25:53.014
- You going to share that?

25:53.051 --> 25:54.551
You got a minute,
don't you?

25:54.594 --> 25:55.905
- No, I don't.
I got nothing for you.

25:55.929 --> 25:57.073
- Okay, harv.
- Can you help me?

25:57.097 --> 25:58.637
- I can't help you, man.
- No?

25:58.682 --> 26:00.812
- I can't help you.
I cannot help you.

26:00.850 --> 26:02.537
- Let me just talk to you
for a minute, harv.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.271
- Okay.

26:04.312 --> 26:06.812
Ah... ah, hell.

26:06.856 --> 26:11.276
He's got no time for me.

26:11.319 --> 26:13.149
- Jesus.

26:13.196 --> 26:15.526
- Harv's...
Harv's got a terrible heart.

26:15.574 --> 26:17.034
You think
you could just touch him?

26:17.075 --> 26:18.985
- Don't do that to me, man.
Don't do that.

26:19.035 --> 26:21.615
- You're right.
I'm sorry. Sorry.

26:21.663 --> 26:23.253
It was wrong of me.
I'm sorry.

26:23.290 --> 26:25.620
Dean, I know someone
you could talk to

26:25.667 --> 26:27.787
who knows much more about this
than I do.

26:27.836 --> 26:31.916
Just think about it, okay?

26:31.965 --> 26:33.715
- In our faith,

26:33.758 --> 26:37.218
there's a long history
of these very special moments.

26:37.262 --> 26:41.932
And God has frequently chosen
the most unexpected person

26:41.975 --> 26:43.845
to carry them through.

26:43.893 --> 26:46.653
- It's a real,
a real privilege, Dean.

26:46.688 --> 26:48.978
- Well, if it's so real,
why doesn't it always work?

26:49.024 --> 26:52.574
- Ah, well,
there's a dual view here.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.651
Anything is possible with God,

26:54.696 --> 26:57.566
but God may not want to give you
what you want.

26:57.616 --> 26:59.066
- Why?

26:59.117 --> 27:02.237
- Because God cares
for your soul.

27:02.287 --> 27:05.907
And what your soul needs
may not be what you want.

27:05.957 --> 27:08.327
- But come on, man,
that's not cool.

27:08.376 --> 27:11.586
- Well, I think you're asking
the right questions, Dean,

27:11.630 --> 27:14.130
but you're not waiting
for the right answers.

27:14.174 --> 27:18.594
There's only one answer.
Pray.

27:18.637 --> 27:20.887
- Look, man, I did pray.
All right?

27:20.930 --> 27:22.930
I tried praying.
It doesn't work.

27:22.974 --> 27:27.604
- I think you were bargaining
for the healing, Dean.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.606
And that is not
the same thing.

27:29.648 --> 27:32.778
I think you should say hello
to God.

27:32.817 --> 27:35.277
- Yeah, what if I'm pissed off
at God?

27:35.320 --> 27:38.240
What if I think God's
bullshit?

27:38.281 --> 27:42.121
- I would say hello first
and then tell him he's bullshit

27:42.160 --> 27:46.040
and you're pissed off.

27:46.081 --> 27:48.751
Look at me, son.

27:48.792 --> 27:52.882
God is trying to say hello
to you

27:52.921 --> 27:57.301
and to tell you
that healing is possible.

27:57.342 --> 27:59.342
Now how are you going
to respond?

27:59.386 --> 28:01.966
Because
that's the big question.

28:02.013 --> 28:06.313
Something magical,

28:06.351 --> 28:09.901
wondrous is happening
through you.

28:09.938 --> 28:17.238
You're having a calling
in this life

28:17.278 --> 28:23.158
and that, my son,
is your healing.

28:50.228 --> 28:52.188
- What if you don't want...?

28:52.230 --> 28:53.770
I mean, I don't want that.

28:53.815 --> 28:55.209
You know, what if you don't want
a calling?

28:55.233 --> 28:56.983
- I think you should try
this gift.

28:57.026 --> 28:59.356
- Yeah, but what about my music?
That's my calling.

28:59.404 --> 29:00.904
- There's no difference

29:00.947 --> 29:02.697
between you being a musician
and healing.

29:02.741 --> 29:04.201
- What are you talking about?

29:04.242 --> 29:06.095
What am I supposed to do?
Go around touching people?

29:06.119 --> 29:07.159
- Why not?

29:07.203 --> 29:08.453
- And be a dj?

29:08.496 --> 29:09.996
- Why not?

29:10.039 --> 29:12.709
I mean, you have a calling.
You have a gift.

29:12.751 --> 29:14.171
Do it, try it.
- How?

29:14.210 --> 29:16.040
- Come down to skid.

29:16.087 --> 29:19.207
Dean,
I have no lack of people

29:19.257 --> 29:20.717
who need healings
down in skid row.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.299
Do a few days down there.

29:22.343 --> 29:24.433
- But I don't want everybody
knowing about it, padre.

29:24.471 --> 29:26.351
They're already coming up to me.
You saw it.

29:26.389 --> 29:29.309
- How about I give you
a hotel room?

29:29.350 --> 29:30.890
That's what I'll do.

29:30.935 --> 29:33.225
I'll put you up in a hotel room
for a few days.

29:33.271 --> 29:36.901
When I came down the skid,

29:36.941 --> 29:40.071
it wasn't
to be a feeder's alley.

29:40.111 --> 29:42.451
I went down there to build

29:42.489 --> 29:45.369
a state-of-the-art
homeless shelter.

29:45.408 --> 29:46.908
I could feed people,

29:46.951 --> 29:48.241
I could get them
off the streets,

29:48.286 --> 29:49.746
I could educate them,

29:49.788 --> 29:52.248
and I could put them back
into society.

29:52.290 --> 29:56.040
I don't want to sustain misery
in skid row.

29:59.881 --> 30:02.931
- Do you think I...

30:05.553 --> 30:09.523
Do you really think
I could be healed?

30:09.557 --> 30:12.887
- Entirely possible.

30:16.981 --> 30:20.071
- All right.

30:20.109 --> 30:23.149
- Right.

30:23.196 --> 30:25.776
- I got to go now.
I really got to go.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.454
- Go where?
- I got the gig.

30:27.492 --> 30:28.912
- Okay, let's go.
Let's go.

30:28.952 --> 30:29.970
- Can you drop me off
at the gig?

30:29.994 --> 30:31.084
- Sure, where? The gig?

30:31.120 --> 30:32.410
- The motel.
- What motel?

30:32.455 --> 30:34.955
- The motel
you just offered me.

30:34.999 --> 30:37.999
- Yes, duh. Sure.

31:00.525 --> 31:04.275
♪ ♪

31:04.320 --> 31:05.820
- Who is it?

31:05.864 --> 31:07.324
On the turntables.
Who's scratching?

31:07.365 --> 31:09.985
- Dude,
that's maestro sonica.

31:10.034 --> 31:16.834
- Fuck. Fuck. Fuck!

32:18.603 --> 32:21.403
- That was fucking rubbish.

32:21.439 --> 32:25.189
And you're all fucking fired
in the morning,

32:25.234 --> 32:30.034
unless I wake up
with a clear head.

32:30.073 --> 32:32.913
Well, well, well.

32:32.951 --> 32:34.411
Look at what the cat
rolled in.

32:34.452 --> 32:36.042
You're coming
in the back door, d?

32:36.079 --> 32:38.039
Are your trolling
for crumbs?

32:38.081 --> 32:39.371
Fuck off. Go on.

32:39.415 --> 32:43.915
- My one and only groupie,
Dean.

32:43.962 --> 32:45.439
- What the hell
are you doing here, man?

32:45.463 --> 32:48.133
- Dude, man, you fucking
fried your fuck up.

32:48.174 --> 32:49.684
- We got ourselves a dj.
Sorry.

32:49.717 --> 32:51.297
- Let me tell you something,
man.

32:51.344 --> 32:53.394
The altar boy,

32:53.429 --> 32:56.389
he doesn't grab from the pointy,
punty, puffed up,

32:56.432 --> 32:58.272
pious, pope pan.

32:58.309 --> 33:01.349
He's off to the side
juggling his trinkets.

33:01.396 --> 33:03.606
- Dude, he just said
"puffed up pope."

33:03.648 --> 33:05.438
Dude, Dean, come on, man.

33:05.483 --> 33:08.573
Just puff

33:16.119 --> 33:17.079
Ow!

33:17.120 --> 33:19.250

33:19.288 --> 33:20.538
- What the fuck

33:20.581 --> 33:23.581
- Ah! Ah. Fucking burned me.
- Asshole.

33:23.626 --> 33:25.126
You going around
burning people now?

33:25.169 --> 33:26.589
- What the fuck
are you doing man?

33:26.629 --> 33:29.459
- Ow!
- Fuckin' cut the shit, man!

33:33.344 --> 33:35.054
- Dean, get off him!
- Dean!

33:35.096 --> 33:36.636
- Get the fuck off him, man.

33:36.681 --> 33:40.141

33:41.436 --> 33:43.096
Get the fuck out of here.

33:43.146 --> 33:45.146
Get him out of here.

33:45.189 --> 33:47.689
- Wait, wait dudes.
Dudes! Dudes! Bros, man!

33:47.734 --> 33:51.324
Fuck, dudes.

33:51.362 --> 33:53.202
- What the fuck is that?
- What?

33:53.239 --> 33:55.199
- Fuck that, man.
- I didn't do it.

33:55.241 --> 33:57.201
It wasn't a fucking trick.

33:57.243 --> 34:01.003
- What the fuck was that?

34:06.044 --> 34:09.054
- Shit, bro.

34:09.088 --> 34:13.588
- Hey!

34:13.634 --> 34:16.643
What the fuck was that?

34:16.679 --> 34:20.059
What were you doing
in there?

34:20.099 --> 34:22.268
I told him that you ap...

34:22.310 --> 34:26.520
You think they give a fuck
what I'm saying?

34:29.567 --> 34:35.107
Are you a-a magician?

34:35.156 --> 34:36.485
Do you need me to help?

34:36.532 --> 34:37.717
- No, I don't want
your fucking help.

34:37.742 --> 34:40.702
Did I ask for your help?

34:40.745 --> 34:43.245
- So, what, you to come
to people's places,

34:43.289 --> 34:45.248
like, doing party tricks
and shit?

34:45.291 --> 34:48.341
- Yeah. Yeah.
It was a party trick. Okay?

34:48.377 --> 34:50.297
It was a stupid
fucking party trick

34:50.338 --> 34:53.088
and just forget
you ever saw it.

35:02.225 --> 35:04.078
What are you doing? Get out.
Get out of the fucking...

35:04.102 --> 35:05.482
Get out
of the fucking car, Ariel.

35:05.520 --> 35:09.560
- No.

35:09.607 --> 35:11.817
Get out of the car!

35:11.859 --> 35:14.739
You're not going to win
this battle.

35:25.790 --> 35:28.080
Are you okay?

35:35.424 --> 35:38.684
I'm sorry. Okay?

35:46.811 --> 35:50.441
So this is where you live?

35:50.481 --> 35:54.151
- Yeah.

35:54.193 --> 35:57.613
- I love it.

35:57.655 --> 36:03.285
I love sleazy motels.

36:03.327 --> 36:08.617
It's like hell with a...
With a warm light.

36:11.752 --> 36:15.762
So what's your secret?

36:15.798 --> 36:20.178
How did you do that...

36:20.219 --> 36:23.309
With oogie?

36:23.347 --> 36:26.637
Did you really heal him?

36:30.313 --> 36:32.613
- I don't know how I did it,
Ariel.

36:39.864 --> 36:45.414
- Huh. It's a curse.

37:40.633 --> 37:46.393
- Dean, this is Maria lupita.
She has emphysema.

37:48.015 --> 37:49.805
She hasn't spoken
to her family.

37:49.850 --> 37:52.350
Her family hasn't spoken
to her in years.

37:52.395 --> 37:55.555
She's alone
in this world, Dean.

38:21.924 --> 38:24.934
- Ah!

38:27.888 --> 38:31.468
Thank you. Thank you.

38:40.484 --> 38:42.494
- Thank you, Jesus!
- Thank you, Jesus!

38:42.528 --> 38:44.648
- Amazing. Amazing.
- A miracle.

38:44.697 --> 38:51.787
It's amazing.
- I can't believe it.

38:51.829 --> 38:54.579
- I don't want to hear
their names anymore, okay?

38:54.623 --> 38:56.793
Of the people.
Or what they have.

38:56.834 --> 38:58.464
Like the medical history
and all that.

38:58.502 --> 39:03.302
None of that. No chitchat.
Just bring them to me.

39:03.341 --> 39:05.801
- Dean, I got to tell you,

39:05.843 --> 39:09.723
in all my work, not in Africa,
or the favelas in rio,

39:09.764 --> 39:11.774
or working here feeding
the homeless

39:11.807 --> 39:15.347
have I ever seen the grace
that I saw today.

39:15.394 --> 39:16.734
It's a real blessing, Dean.

39:16.771 --> 39:19.811
I-I-i hope
you understand that.

39:24.528 --> 39:30.448
- Mmm. How much money
did we make today?

39:30.493 --> 39:32.083
With the donations?

39:36.916 --> 39:42.746
- Dean, I-i can't pay you

39:42.797 --> 39:44.877
to lay hands, Dean.

39:44.924 --> 39:48.724
That's God working
through you.

39:48.761 --> 39:50.601
I can't... I can't pay you
to do that.

39:50.638 --> 39:52.598
I'm already paying
for your hotel room.

39:52.640 --> 39:54.720
- Yeah, $39.99 a night.

39:54.767 --> 39:56.517
- Which is a fortune for us
down here.

39:56.560 --> 39:57.829
Do you know how many people
I can feed

39:57.853 --> 40:00.943
with that kind of money?

40:03.609 --> 40:06.529
I know... I know it's...
How about...

40:06.570 --> 40:09.700
How about I give you a few
extra dollars a day?

40:09.740 --> 40:11.700
Just to help out
with incidentals.

40:11.742 --> 40:15.122
Toothpaste. Gas.
- How much?

40:15.162 --> 40:17.752
- Ma... $40... $42 a day.

40:17.790 --> 40:20.960
- On top of the $39?
- Are you kidding me?

40:21.001 --> 40:22.461
- $42 total?
- $42.

40:22.503 --> 40:24.133
- Well, I drive a guzzler,
padre.

40:24.171 --> 40:25.771
You know what it takes
to fill that tank?

40:25.798 --> 40:29.508
- Okay. Well, how about...
How about...

40:29.552 --> 40:31.052
I don't know.

40:31.095 --> 40:35.135
What... what $40... $43?
$43?

40:35.182 --> 40:40.152
Let me just work
this out here.

40:40.187 --> 40:42.607
- I mean, I'm not trying to be,
you know... I just...

40:42.648 --> 40:44.626
- I know. I know, Dean.
It's just a lot of money for...

40:44.650 --> 40:47.030
I... I... I could probably...
I could probably swing $40...

40:47.069 --> 40:49.989
$44? $44? $45 a day.

40:50.030 --> 40:53.030
- You can't go $50?
- $50?

40:53.075 --> 40:55.785
$47. $47.50.

40:55.828 --> 40:58.408
- $47.50?
How about $48?

40:58.456 --> 40:59.850
- Okay, make it $48.
We'll round it up to $48.

40:59.874 --> 41:01.084
- $48.
- Will that...

41:01.125 --> 41:02.535
That's going to be enough?
- Okay.

41:02.585 --> 41:04.915
- Great. Great.

41:04.962 --> 41:08.092
So I'll make a note of it.

41:08.132 --> 41:13.182
$47.50 per day.

41:13.220 --> 41:18.100
Okay, $48 per day.
Per day.

42:12.905 --> 42:17.485
- What aday. What aday.
It's unbelievable.

42:17.535 --> 42:21.995
So many people...
So many people were healed.

42:22.039 --> 42:24.709
Right there in front of me.

42:24.750 --> 42:27.500
Things have totally changed
around down there.

42:27.545 --> 42:29.189
I am getting a hundred times
more donations now

42:29.213 --> 42:32.843
than ever before.

42:32.883 --> 42:38.853
- How does Dean feel
about that?

42:38.889 --> 42:44.059
- Good. He's good.

42:44.103 --> 42:47.813
But, you know, you can't fix
everybody on the skid.

42:47.856 --> 42:52.646
And besides that,
you're way overdue on a retreat.

42:52.695 --> 42:54.895
Now, you know that
as well as I do.

42:54.947 --> 42:56.197
- Uh-hmm.

42:56.240 --> 42:59.870
- I want you to get
on a retreat soon.

42:59.910 --> 43:02.200
You're a little tensed up,
Joe.

43:02.246 --> 43:06.166
- Okay. All right.

43:06.208 --> 43:08.538
- Promise?
- As soon as this is done.

43:08.586 --> 43:10.996
- Okay. Then finish
your sandwich.

43:11.046 --> 43:13.876
- I'm starving.

43:16.760 --> 43:18.720
- You can say to yourself

43:18.762 --> 43:20.562
"with all I have,

43:20.598 --> 43:23.218
"I'm going
to bless somebody else.

43:23.267 --> 43:25.267
"And if I don't drive
what I drive

43:25.311 --> 43:27.651
and live where I live,
it don't matter."

43:29.607 --> 43:31.647
"I just want
to help somebody else."

43:31.692 --> 43:36.992
Can I preach like I feel it?

43:41.994 --> 43:46.044
- What's up?
- Are you accepting visitors?

43:53.797 --> 44:00.257
You gonna invite us in?

44:00.304 --> 44:03.014
- What's going on?
- Oogie's no liar.

44:03.057 --> 44:05.637
I made him take a lie detector
test anyway.

44:05.684 --> 44:07.064
- It's fucking true, man.

44:07.102 --> 44:09.272
He made me take a fucking
lie detector test.

44:09.313 --> 44:12.023
- I know this guy.

44:12.066 --> 44:15.026
He does it on the side.

44:15.069 --> 44:17.029
I'm not a believer, d.

44:17.071 --> 44:19.911
I'm not even sure that I care.
But I've got to know.

44:19.948 --> 44:22.028
Are you fucking with us?

44:22.076 --> 44:24.116
- I should not have done it,
okay?

44:24.161 --> 44:25.831
I should not
have done that.

44:25.871 --> 44:29.001
- No. You shouldn't
have done it, but you did.

44:29.041 --> 44:34.301
You want to show us.
And I want you to show me.

44:35.381 --> 44:37.881
Look.

44:37.925 --> 44:41.835
Nothing up my sleeve.

44:41.887 --> 44:43.007
Right.

44:43.055 --> 44:44.805
- The stain, no. Don't.

44:44.848 --> 44:46.138
It doesn't work like that,
man.

44:46.183 --> 44:48.983
I'm serious. Come on.
Don't do it.

44:49.019 --> 44:51.081
It doesn't work like that, man.
- That's going to hurt, bro.

44:51.105 --> 44:52.685
- I'm serious.
- Oh!

44:52.731 --> 44:54.321
That's fucked up, man.

44:54.358 --> 44:56.778
What, you're going to put him
through this shit again?

44:56.819 --> 44:59.989
- Ow! Fuck!
- For fuck's sake, man.

45:00.030 --> 45:01.660
- Ow!
- I know. I know.

45:01.699 --> 45:03.829
- Burn your own fucking arm,
you fucking psychopath.

45:03.867 --> 45:05.157
- I know.
That's really fucked.

45:05.202 --> 45:06.992
Stop fucking laughing, man.

45:07.037 --> 45:08.907
You said you were gonna
burn yourself, man.

45:08.956 --> 45:10.156
- Come here.
- Let me see that.

45:10.207 --> 45:11.167
- Give it to me.
Give it to me.

45:11.208 --> 45:12.168
- Right.
- Fuck.

45:12.209 --> 45:13.749
- Do it, man.
- Ah.

45:13.794 --> 45:15.424
- I want to see this.
I need to see this.

45:15.462 --> 45:20.222
Shut up, oogie.

45:20.259 --> 45:21.679
- That really burns.

45:21.719 --> 45:24.759
- That is such
some fucked up mojo.

45:24.805 --> 45:27.305
- Fuck, man!
- Come here. Let me look.

45:27.349 --> 45:29.309
- No, man. No. No.
- Oh, my God.

45:29.351 --> 45:32.441
- No way, bro.
No fucking way, dude.

45:32.479 --> 45:36.689
What? No, man.
No way. No way. Uh-uh.

45:36.734 --> 45:39.154
No, man. I'm not
in your fucking band, no.

45:39.194 --> 45:42.784
No... uh... no. No.

45:42.823 --> 45:45.033
- He'll get over it.
- He's so sensitive.

45:45.075 --> 45:47.825
- Look, d, I was down
with your shit

45:47.870 --> 45:49.080
the minute I heard it.

45:49.121 --> 45:50.961
I think that's know.
- Totally.

45:50.998 --> 45:54.418
- You got serious
fucking attitude dysfunction.

45:54.460 --> 45:56.340
But this shit, man...

45:56.378 --> 46:00.878
This is epic. This...
We could do this together, man.

46:00.924 --> 46:03.014
The only way forward
is to be real...

46:03.051 --> 46:04.431
Is to do something iconic.

46:04.470 --> 46:06.890
It's not created
by choreographers

46:06.930 --> 46:11.270
or some lame London designer's
ball sack.

46:11.310 --> 46:12.730
- That's why you came?

46:12.770 --> 46:13.913
- We could have fun
with this, d.

46:13.937 --> 46:17.107
- No.
- Titillate the masses.

46:17.149 --> 46:20.359
- I don't titillate.

46:20.402 --> 46:22.072
I'm a turntablist.

46:22.112 --> 46:23.782
You want me in your band,

46:23.822 --> 46:25.742
it's 'cause I'm a fucking
turntablist.

46:25.783 --> 46:27.844
- We want you in the band, Dean,
because of your music.

46:27.868 --> 46:29.262
We want a little of this,
a little of that,

46:29.286 --> 46:30.906
a little of this.

46:30.954 --> 46:33.834
- No, I'm not going to be
some sideshow freak.

46:33.874 --> 46:35.424
- We want you in the band.

46:35.459 --> 46:38.879
- Dean, come on, man.
You are an artist.

46:38.921 --> 46:41.381
- Dean.
- We want you in the band.

46:43.509 --> 46:44.969
Do you hear that, d?

46:45.010 --> 46:48.180
That is opportunity
knocking.

46:48.222 --> 46:50.522
Your life is in your hands.

46:50.557 --> 46:53.427
What are you going
to do, brother?

47:01.985 --> 47:05.025
And lead us
not into temptation,

47:05.072 --> 47:06.952
but deliver us from evil.

47:06.990 --> 47:09.780
For thine is the kingdom,
and the power,

47:09.827 --> 47:13.787
and the glory,
for ever and ever. Amen.

47:13.831 --> 47:16.421
- Move the tents here so I can
deal with infirm people.

47:16.458 --> 47:18.838
What about the bibles?
What did we do with the bibles?

47:18.877 --> 47:22.337
Get the bibles. Kyle?
Kyle? Who? Who?

47:22.381 --> 47:24.221
- Father Charles?
Father Charles?

47:24.258 --> 47:26.128
- This is your lucky day.
He's coming.

47:26.176 --> 47:27.816
He's going to be here.
You're gonna get...

47:27.845 --> 47:29.795
You're gonna get
your old ticker healed today.

47:29.847 --> 47:31.807
Today's the day.
Today is the day.

47:31.849 --> 47:33.809
Make sure the people
are off the streets, okay?

47:33.851 --> 47:35.141
We got to get these people...

47:35.185 --> 47:37.555
We don't have permits.
We have nothing.

47:37.604 --> 47:40.444
- I heard your service
about your friend.

47:40.482 --> 47:43.072
Please, I will double...
I will double the building fund

47:43.110 --> 47:44.280
for your charity.

47:44.319 --> 47:47.149
You understand?
Double for my daughter.

47:47.197 --> 47:49.487
He must see her. Alone.
I don't want this.

47:49.533 --> 47:51.873
Do you understand?
Please.

47:51.910 --> 47:54.200
I will double the fund.
I have to see him.

47:54.246 --> 47:56.206
- I'll do my best.
- Please. Please.

47:56.248 --> 47:58.998
- I will.
You have my word.

47:59.042 --> 48:02.092
Meet... meet me here.

48:02.129 --> 48:04.009
Meet me in one moment.

48:04.047 --> 48:07.087
Can you make sure that she's
comfortable somewhere?

48:07.134 --> 48:09.514
Put her... put her in the tent
for a moment, okay?

48:09.553 --> 48:12.353
He's here?

48:51.261 --> 48:54.561
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

48:59.102 --> 49:02.232
- It's a blessing.
It's a miracle.

49:06.151 --> 49:09.151
- One more heal.

49:17.079 --> 49:19.909
- It's not happening.
No.

49:19.957 --> 49:21.457
It's not happening.
I'm sorry.

49:21.500 --> 49:23.420
It doesn't always happen.
Doesn't always work.

49:23.460 --> 49:24.687
- Doesn't always work.
It doesn't...

49:24.711 --> 49:26.631
Doesn't always work,
everybody.

49:26.672 --> 49:31.052
It's... it doesn't
always work.

49:40.352 --> 49:42.602
That's the Lord
working there.

49:42.646 --> 49:47.316
Praise the Lord, okay?
Next. Unbelievable.

49:47.359 --> 49:48.628
- All right,
you don't have to fall.

49:48.652 --> 49:50.322
They're all falling now.

49:53.073 --> 49:54.283
- What?
I don't understand.

49:59.037 --> 50:00.447
- She wants you
to touch the cloth.

50:00.497 --> 50:01.997
If you touch the cloth,

50:02.040 --> 50:04.000
she could take it back
to heal her husband.

50:04.042 --> 50:06.020
They did it in the Bible.

50:06.044 --> 50:09.014
This is insane, man.

50:09.047 --> 50:10.967
I got to get out here.
I'm not doing anything.

50:11.008 --> 50:12.968
- Don't you see
what you're doing?

50:13.010 --> 50:14.487
- You're doing great.
- I'm feeling anything.

50:14.511 --> 50:16.301
- Don't you see?
- All right. All right.

50:16.346 --> 50:18.596
- The holy spirit is flowing
through this hellhole, Dean.

50:18.640 --> 50:20.310
Can't you all feel it?

50:20.350 --> 50:22.161
Okay, here you go.

50:22.185 --> 50:24.345
Here you go. Okay.

50:28.567 --> 50:32.647
- Thank you. Thank you.

50:32.696 --> 50:34.486
It's okay, Dean.
This is wonderful.

50:34.531 --> 50:36.161
It's wonderful
what's happening.

50:36.199 --> 50:37.989
Okay, who's next? Okay.

50:38.035 --> 50:39.345
Let's start over here
with the line.

50:39.369 --> 50:40.999
Come to the back
of the line here.

50:41.038 --> 50:42.458
- I need a break.
We'll come back.

50:42.497 --> 50:44.100
- There's so many people.
- I need a break.

50:44.124 --> 50:45.601
- Okay. Okay.
Let's let him have a break.

50:45.625 --> 50:47.455
Let's... let's...
Just... just make some way.

50:47.502 --> 50:50.172
Make some way, folks.
Make some way.

50:50.213 --> 50:52.173
- Heal me, brother.
- Get off me.

50:52.215 --> 50:55.675
- Hold... hold on, everybody.
Hold on. Make some way.

50:55.719 --> 50:57.697
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Just give him some air, okay?

50:57.721 --> 50:59.141
He needs a break.

50:59.181 --> 51:00.658
- This is getting, like,
painful, man.

51:00.682 --> 51:02.362
I'm serious.
I don't understand, all right?

51:02.392 --> 51:03.536
How much money
have you taken in?

51:03.560 --> 51:05.100
You can raise my wage.
- Dean.

51:05.145 --> 51:07.095
We're gonna renegotiate.

51:07.147 --> 51:08.541
I could be doing this
on stage, man.

51:08.565 --> 51:10.265
This is ridiculous.

51:10.317 --> 51:11.753
- I told you I can't pay you
to do this. What?

51:11.777 --> 51:13.527
- Channel two is here.
- No. No.

51:13.570 --> 51:14.714
There's nothing
happening here.

51:14.738 --> 51:16.238
There's nothing to report.

51:16.281 --> 51:17.508
- Why can't I talk
to the reporters?

51:17.532 --> 51:18.702
I'm the one
they want to see.

51:18.742 --> 51:20.202
- We are not talking
to reporters.

51:20.243 --> 51:21.703
We're going
to advertise you now?

51:21.745 --> 51:23.385
Look at this.
It's already out of control.

51:23.413 --> 51:25.058
Yo, you're the one who turned it
into m.A.S.H.

51:25.082 --> 51:27.792
I never said I'd do this!

51:27.834 --> 51:29.714
- Okay, hold on.
Just stay back everyone.

51:29.753 --> 51:34.593
- Move. Move.

51:34.633 --> 51:38.053
No, no, no, no, no. No!
No, fucking way!

51:38.095 --> 51:41.215
No! Move! No!

51:41.264 --> 51:44.144
Move!

51:44.184 --> 51:46.144
No. Move.
- Dean.

51:46.186 --> 51:47.726
- Touch me.

51:47.771 --> 51:49.561
- He just needs a break,
everybody.

51:49.606 --> 51:51.356
Let me just talk to him
for a moment.

51:51.399 --> 51:53.819
Dean, Dean, you get back here
right now.

51:53.860 --> 51:56.240
- I am not touching
that guy!

51:56.279 --> 51:57.590
- One more, Dean.
- No fucking way!

51:57.614 --> 51:59.454
- One more.

51:59.491 --> 52:01.661
- If I ain't getting up,
he ain't getting up!

52:01.701 --> 52:02.845
- It's not Rene faubacher,
Dean.

52:02.869 --> 52:04.369
It's not Rene faubacher.

52:04.412 --> 52:05.832
- You said do this
and I get healed.

52:05.872 --> 52:07.832
- Okay, that's it.
That's enough.

52:07.874 --> 52:10.544
All right? No more.

52:10.585 --> 52:14.125
Listen to me, Dean.
Listen to me.

52:14.172 --> 52:16.762
There is a major
contributor here

52:16.800 --> 52:20.590
who is offering to make
a huge donation to this shelter

52:20.637 --> 52:22.597
to help people...
Really help people...

52:22.639 --> 52:25.769
If you lay hands
on his daughter.

52:27.352 --> 52:31.732
Please. Please.
- Where is he?

52:31.773 --> 52:34.113
- He's... hold on.
Hold on one second.

52:34.151 --> 52:36.651
Zaheedi?
Is Mr. zaheedi here?

52:36.695 --> 52:39.445
Can you bring Mr. zaheedi?

52:39.489 --> 52:42.619
This is Mr. zaheedi.
Dean o'dwyer.

52:42.659 --> 52:44.470
- What is it? What's wrong?
- My daughter, my child.

52:44.494 --> 52:45.794
She has cerebral palsy.
- Mm-hmm.

52:45.829 --> 52:47.499
- From birth.
She's been suffering.

52:47.539 --> 52:49.369
L-I can't save
my own child.

52:49.416 --> 52:50.810
If there is anything
that you can do...

52:50.834 --> 52:53.254
- How much?
- No. No. No.

52:53.295 --> 52:54.438
- What's the...
What's the offer?

52:54.462 --> 52:56.132
- No, Dean.

52:56.173 --> 52:57.650
That's really between him
and the church.

52:57.674 --> 52:59.527
- I offered $250,000.
If... if... if she's healed.

52:59.551 --> 53:03.601
If she's healed.

53:03.638 --> 53:06.768
- For the shelter.

53:06.808 --> 53:09.228
- Two hundred
and fifty grand?

53:14.274 --> 53:17.154
Pay me.
- I'm sorry. Wait. What?

53:17.194 --> 53:18.754
- Give me the 250 grand
if you want me to do it.

53:18.778 --> 53:20.198
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.

53:20.238 --> 53:21.465
You don't need him.
You need me.

53:21.489 --> 53:22.633
- Can I talk to you
for a minute?

53:22.657 --> 53:23.801
- You got your checkbook
on you?

53:23.825 --> 53:25.155
- Dean?
- No.

53:25.202 --> 53:26.582
Can I speak to you
for a minute?

53:26.620 --> 53:28.370
- I'm out of here.
- What are you doing?

53:28.413 --> 53:30.183
- I just wanna help my child.
- How can you do this?

53:30.207 --> 53:32.185
- You want your daughter healed,
follow me. Follow me.

53:32.209 --> 53:34.419
Listen up everybody.

53:36.963 --> 53:42.303
- All right, you want it?

53:42.344 --> 53:45.854
You want it?

53:45.889 --> 53:49.179
Come to the fuckin' show.

56:35.141 --> 56:36.681
Stain, man...

56:36.726 --> 56:38.016
- You're a fuckin'
rock star bro.

56:38.061 --> 56:41.361
- I am the fucking Lord

56:41.398 --> 56:43.648
thy want of come.

56:43.691 --> 56:48.031
- Oh!
- That's fuckin' right.

56:48.071 --> 56:50.361
I fuckin' christen thee

56:50.407 --> 56:52.697
double d delicious.

56:52.742 --> 56:55.042
Nina, Nina,
it fuckin' works.

56:55.078 --> 56:59.418
I told you it would work,
your doubter, and it works!

56:59.457 --> 57:01.497
- I smell it.

57:01.543 --> 57:06.383
Do you understand
what happened tonight?

57:06.423 --> 57:08.383
You all gave birth tonight.

57:08.425 --> 57:11.135
And now we have a child.

57:11.177 --> 57:13.597
- Dude, we have a child.

57:13.638 --> 57:17.848
We... we brought a new life

57:17.892 --> 57:21.772
into the stale fuckin' world
of rock.

57:21.813 --> 57:24.823
- You were all brilliant.

57:24.858 --> 57:28.608
Stain,
it was your night, baby.

57:28.653 --> 57:31.493
- Too fuckin' right, it was.
- You did it.

57:31.531 --> 57:34.911
You took your place.
- Too fuckin' right, I did.

57:34.951 --> 57:39.411
- Chuck, a power man.
Brash.

57:39.456 --> 57:42.456
Oogie, I could taste you.

57:45.211 --> 57:50.551
Ariel, you had wings
on your back.

57:50.592 --> 57:54.892
I could see your wings.

57:54.929 --> 57:58.809
And you...

57:58.850 --> 58:01.940
You sexy motherfucker.

58:01.978 --> 58:03.648
- That is right.

58:03.688 --> 58:06.818
I called him forth.

58:06.858 --> 58:09.148
I plucked him hence.

58:09.194 --> 58:11.994
- Stain, my love,

58:12.030 --> 58:14.780
you have to write a song.

58:14.824 --> 58:17.664
A song
that will support our d

58:17.702 --> 58:20.622
as he rolls downstage.

58:20.663 --> 58:25.043
Because when we tour,
which we will,

58:25.084 --> 58:29.174
our baby's gonna be named...

58:29.214 --> 58:32.224
"Healapalooza."

58:32.258 --> 58:34.968
- Healapalooza, eh?

58:35.011 --> 58:37.851
- Heala-fuckin'.

58:37.889 --> 58:40.139
Our baby.

58:40.183 --> 58:42.643
Our fuckin' baby.

58:42.685 --> 58:45.515
I am bringing about
the diphthongs experience

58:45.563 --> 58:47.483
to the people.

58:47.524 --> 58:50.034
Let's get something straight,
Nina, love, all right?

58:50.068 --> 58:52.148
I wanted Dean in the band
from the beginning

58:52.195 --> 58:53.855
because of his scratching.

58:53.905 --> 58:58.985
This man is an artist.
Not some sideshow freak.

58:59.035 --> 59:03.655
He's not gonna sell himself out
to a little magic hands trick.

59:03.706 --> 59:06.666
The band is the music.

59:06.709 --> 59:09.039
We will override the show
into some display

59:09.087 --> 59:10.667
and be respected.

59:10.713 --> 59:15.683
But, d, dude, you may end up
a pathetic joke.

59:15.718 --> 59:20.848
Are you cool with that,
man?

59:20.890 --> 59:26.850
- Fuck it.
Long as I'm getting paid.

59:26.896 --> 59:31.276
- Do y'all hear that?
Are we clear, Nina?

59:31.317 --> 59:34.527
- Yeah.
- Good.

59:34.571 --> 59:38.701
- I've got phone calls
to make.

59:47.208 --> 59:50.788
- You think I'm a sell-out
sideshow freak?

59:50.837 --> 59:52.087
- What do you care?

59:52.130 --> 59:53.960
As long as you're getting paid,
right?

59:54.007 --> 59:56.047
- Oh, fuck it, Ariel.

59:56.092 --> 59:57.592
What am I supposed to do?

59:57.635 --> 01:00:00.545
Go back to living
in my fuckin' car?

01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:03.057
- That's good.
That's good.

01:00:03.099 --> 01:00:05.309
You're owed. You're owed.
You're owed, right?

01:00:05.351 --> 01:00:08.231
Yeah, everybody owes you.
- You're so full of shit!

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:10.111
I'm about to put
your crap ass band

01:00:10.148 --> 01:00:11.688
on the fucking map!

01:00:11.733 --> 01:00:13.127
I'm gonna give everything
you wanted!

01:00:13.151 --> 01:00:15.281
What's all this purity
coming from you?

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:17.610
- Yeah, myband! Myband!

01:00:17.655 --> 01:00:20.735
My fuckin' band,
you motherfucker!

01:00:20.783 --> 01:00:24.203
You fuckin' piece of shit!

01:00:24.245 --> 01:00:27.285
You have God's gift!
You have God's gift!

01:00:27.332 --> 01:00:30.792
Do you even care
about those people, Dean?

01:00:30.835 --> 01:00:33.705
Do you even care what happens
to them?

01:00:33.755 --> 01:00:37.875
Who the fuck are you?
I know my place in the world.

01:00:37.925 --> 01:00:43.095
What the fuck are you?
Piece of shit.

01:00:55.193 --> 01:01:02.323
- I'm so glad you decided
to legally join the fold.

01:01:02.367 --> 01:01:06.947
- I can never fire you ever.

01:01:06.996 --> 01:01:12.626
Dean, look, there were 17 sick
or infirm people

01:01:12.669 --> 01:01:14.799
in the audience
the other night.

01:01:14.837 --> 01:01:16.957
Twelve of them said
they were healed.

01:01:17.006 --> 01:01:18.626
Now if that's an indicator,

01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:21.295
then you're missing 28%
of the time,

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:24.644
which is a marketing
nightmare.

01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:28.681
And that means
that I have to deal with it,

01:01:28.726 --> 01:01:30.162
which you shouldn't have
to know about.

01:01:30.186 --> 01:01:32.396
But I'm the one who's taking
the risk.

01:01:32.438 --> 01:01:34.688
I need security.

01:01:34.732 --> 01:01:36.418
You'll see.
It's a pretty standard contract.

01:01:36.442 --> 01:01:38.742
Seven-year negotiation clause
on my end,

01:01:38.778 --> 01:01:42.738
plus a few extraamenities,
because I'm so hands-on.

01:01:42.782 --> 01:01:45.782
And we can talk
about sweetening your end.

01:01:45.827 --> 01:01:49.827
How do you feel
about a signing bonus, hmm?

01:01:58.881 --> 01:02:02.381
Good. You ready?

01:02:17.066 --> 01:02:18.936
- It's called "healapalooza."

01:02:18.985 --> 01:02:21.185
Downtown,
there's a buzz going on.

01:02:21.237 --> 01:02:24.317
A new band claims to heal people
during their show,

01:02:24.365 --> 01:02:26.195
actually physically
heal them.

01:02:26.242 --> 01:02:28.412
Fans are swearing up and down
they've received healings

01:02:28.453 --> 01:02:32.373
from the touch of the band's dj,
delicious Dean.

01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:24.419
- The controversial
healapalooza tour

01:03:24.467 --> 01:03:28.007
is gaining momentum
of true biblical proportions.

01:03:28.054 --> 01:03:30.434
Arty punk-rock band,
burnt the diphthongs,

01:03:30.473 --> 01:03:33.773
denied accusations
that their onstage miracles

01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:36.270
are nothing more
than a publicity stunt.

01:03:36.312 --> 01:03:37.852
In fact,
they claimed the show

01:03:37.897 --> 01:03:40.317
is really
all about the music.

01:03:40.358 --> 01:03:43.188
He touched me
in different places,

01:03:43.236 --> 01:03:45.236
but then he focused
his energy

01:03:45.279 --> 01:03:46.779
where I told him
I had my tumor.

01:03:46.823 --> 01:03:48.217
I wouldn't sleep with him
the whole time.

01:03:48.241 --> 01:03:50.991
- The bizarre scratch rock
healing punk show

01:03:51.035 --> 01:03:54.115
has sparked a riot
and even a religious protest.

01:03:54.163 --> 01:03:57.173
But it's also being called
"new church"

01:03:57.208 --> 01:04:00.038
by its surprisingly diverse
fans.

01:04:00.086 --> 01:04:01.956
- Delicious Dean is God.

01:04:02.004 --> 01:04:04.214
- Despite the growing number
of attacks from doctors

01:04:04.257 --> 01:04:07.967
and the ama denouncing
the show as a hoax

01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:11.140
and projected ticket sales
reaching into the millions,

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:13.810
it's not hard to see
what fans are looking for.

01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:15.350
A need to believe.

01:04:15.393 --> 01:04:18.143
A need for something more
from their music.

01:04:18.187 --> 01:04:20.397
Something in the form
of a touch

01:04:20.439 --> 01:04:24.939
from the band's messianic
superstar.

01:04:54.265 --> 01:04:55.868
- She just pulled me
right out of the crowd,

01:04:55.892 --> 01:04:58.062
said "just put
the neck brace on."

01:04:58.102 --> 01:05:02.942
Ugh. Shit. Easiest $100
I've ever made.

01:05:02.982 --> 01:05:04.126
She made you
say something too?

01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:06.190
- Mm-hmm.

01:05:09.572 --> 01:05:13.372
- What's up?
- Nothing.

01:05:58.537 --> 01:06:01.407
- Where the fuck have you been?
And where the fuck is Ariel?

01:06:01.457 --> 01:06:05.127
We fucking rehearsed this.
You enter before me.

01:06:05.169 --> 01:06:06.959
Listen to me, fuck head.

01:06:07.004 --> 01:06:08.924
I made you, you cunt.

01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:11.125
I put on that fucking stage.

01:06:11.175 --> 01:06:14.505
You just get out there
and turn your fucking tricks.

01:07:02.393 --> 01:07:05.563
- Come on, yeah!

01:07:05.604 --> 01:07:08.484

A little cracker Jack action
and sideshow action.

01:08:29.522 --> 01:08:33.652
That's right, Dean.
They're calling for you, man.

01:08:33.692 --> 01:08:34.822
Give us a little bit

01:08:34.859 --> 01:08:37.529
of your fucking
magic hands trick.

01:08:37.571 --> 01:08:39.781
That's right. Fucking healing.
- Shut the fuck up.

01:08:41.617 --> 01:08:44.117

Come on there, man.
What are you going to do?

01:08:46.747 --> 01:08:48.667
Give them a healing, Dean.
- Shut the fuck up.

01:08:48.707 --> 01:08:51.077
- Heal them.
Heal them, Dean.

01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:55.167
- Fuck you, the stain!
- Use your magic hands.

01:08:55.214 --> 01:08:56.424
- Fuck you.

01:08:56.465 --> 01:08:58.085
- Give them
your magic hands, man.

01:08:58.134 --> 01:08:59.778

- Give them your magic hands.

01:08:59.801 --> 01:09:01.761

01:09:01.804 --> 01:09:04.184

01:09:04.223 --> 01:09:05.773
Where is it?
- Come on.

01:09:05.808 --> 01:09:08.638
- Come on.

01:09:12.857 --> 01:09:16.107
- Hey, Ariel. Ariel.

01:09:16.152 --> 01:09:19.362
Dude, stop.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

01:09:19.404 --> 01:09:22.365
Dude, stain.

01:09:22.408 --> 01:09:24.328
Dude, dude, dude,
get the fucking paramedics.

01:09:24.368 --> 01:09:27.618
She's od'ing.
She's fucking od'ing man.

01:09:27.662 --> 01:09:31.122
Fuck. Dude. Ariel.
Fuck, man.

01:09:56.567 --> 01:09:57.897
- Here.

01:09:57.943 --> 01:10:04.163
Right here
is where homicide begins.

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.240
In these precious moments,

01:10:06.285 --> 01:10:10.865
when life-saving decisions
could have been made,

01:10:10.915 --> 01:10:14.285
what was on the mind
of the rock star,

01:10:14.335 --> 01:10:17.915
Dean o'dwyer?

01:10:17.963 --> 01:10:21.423
What was he thinking

01:10:21.467 --> 01:10:23.547
as Ariel Lee
lay at his feet,

01:10:23.594 --> 01:10:28.314
taking her last breath?

01:10:28.349 --> 01:10:32.939
Was he thinking,
"wow, what a show.

01:10:32.978 --> 01:10:36.188
How are we going
to recreate this?"

01:10:36.232 --> 01:10:37.362
Because I can tell you this,

01:10:37.399 --> 01:10:39.319
he was not thinking
about Ariel Lee

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:41.860
because if he was,

01:10:41.904 --> 01:10:43.954
help would have gotten
to Ariel Lee

01:10:43.989 --> 01:10:45.569
and she might be here today.

01:10:45.616 --> 01:10:49.446
And that, by definition,
is manslaughter.

01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:55.380
- This is a tragedy
to say the least.

01:10:55.417 --> 01:10:58.667
We are all absolutely
devastated.

01:10:58.712 --> 01:11:01.922
Delicious d's actions
were selfless and heroic

01:11:01.966 --> 01:11:05.926
and we ask for your sensitivity
at this time.

01:11:05.970 --> 01:11:10.310
Ariel Lee did not die
because of neglect.

01:11:10.349 --> 01:11:13.559
Ariel Lee died
because she od'd.

01:11:13.602 --> 01:11:19.322
- They were...
People said they were healed.

01:11:19.358 --> 01:11:21.419
- Dean, man, you should have let
the paramedics at her

01:11:21.443 --> 01:11:23.533
because you couldn't heal her
or whatever happened.

01:11:23.570 --> 01:11:26.910
I don't know what happened.
Maybe you did too much.

01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:28.409
- Just remember,
you are under oath,

01:11:28.450 --> 01:11:30.370
so just...
Just tell us the truth.

01:11:30.411 --> 01:11:32.251
- I say
he is the living embodiment

01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:34.998
of all that is good
in humankind.

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:39.540
- We all want to know
there's good in people.

01:11:39.586 --> 01:11:42.336
And I'm no exception
to that.

01:11:44.633 --> 01:11:48.593
The crowd was chanting
for her to be healed.

01:11:48.637 --> 01:11:52.017
They thought it was all part
of the show.

01:11:52.057 --> 01:11:54.557
I grabbed the Mike
to call for help,

01:11:54.601 --> 01:11:58.351
but power had been cut
to the stage

01:11:58.397 --> 01:12:00.857
and the paramedics
had been blocked.

01:12:00.899 --> 01:12:02.779
I didn't get to say

01:12:02.818 --> 01:12:05.608
what needed
to be said that night.

01:12:05.654 --> 01:12:09.624
So I'm going to say
what needs to be said now.

01:12:09.658 --> 01:12:11.778
And it's something
I've been asked not to say

01:12:11.827 --> 01:12:14.327
by Dean o'dwyer
and Nina hogue.

01:12:14.371 --> 01:12:17.291
Objection.
- Your honor, sidebar please.

01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:18.727
- And that is that he's a fake.
- Sidebar.

01:12:18.751 --> 01:12:19.961
- He's a phony.
- Objection!

01:12:20.002 --> 01:12:21.672
- He's a fraud.
- Order!

01:12:21.712 --> 01:12:24.382
- This charlatan son of a bitch!
- Bailiff, remove him.

01:12:24.423 --> 01:12:28.013
- He can't heal shit!
It was all a fucking act!

01:12:28.052 --> 01:12:30.352
You were all duped!
- Order!

01:12:30.387 --> 01:12:33.887
- He never could heal!
You bought a fucking lie!

01:12:33.932 --> 01:12:37.642
Well, welcome
to the fucking show!

01:12:37.686 --> 01:12:40.306
- As the religious
authority figure

01:12:40.356 --> 01:12:42.896
who first encouraged
this gift,

01:12:42.941 --> 01:12:45.651
you can testify to Dean's
healing technique

01:12:45.694 --> 01:12:47.824
and his intense
concentration,

01:12:47.863 --> 01:12:51.413
which would have been
interrupted by the paramedics.

01:12:51.450 --> 01:12:56.080
In that regard, that makes you
our expert witness.

01:12:56.121 --> 01:12:59.581
- And character witness

01:12:59.625 --> 01:13:02.495
describing Dean's early healings
on skid row.

01:13:02.544 --> 01:13:07.594
How selfless he was.
How pure his motives were.

01:13:07.633 --> 01:13:11.473
Mr. o'dwyer has graciously
agreed free of charge

01:13:11.512 --> 01:13:15.682
and for a designated period
of time

01:13:15.724 --> 01:13:17.564
to come down to skid row

01:13:17.601 --> 01:13:22.941
and lay hands
on whomever you wish.

01:13:22.981 --> 01:13:24.901
- In exchange
for my testimony?

01:13:24.942 --> 01:13:28.902
- Yes.
- No. No.

01:13:31.073 --> 01:13:36.043
- Can I speak to Dean alone
for a moment please?

01:13:36.078 --> 01:13:38.038
- You do what you think
is right, father.

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:41.790
By the way,
just so you know,

01:13:41.834 --> 01:13:45.884
I'm a marymount girl

01:13:45.921 --> 01:13:48.881
and I-i had the calling

01:13:48.924 --> 01:13:51.384
to be a nun,

01:13:51.427 --> 01:13:53.717
but I lost my way.

01:13:53.762 --> 01:13:58.812
Maybe sometime we'd get together
and talk about that.

01:13:58.851 --> 01:14:01.981
- Certainly.

01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:06.730
- Thank you, father.
- Thank you, father.

01:14:19.496 --> 01:14:23.076
- Something else, huh?

01:14:28.505 --> 01:14:32.795
- I, um,
I brought you something.

01:14:32.843 --> 01:14:36.013
Show you some of the good work
you did.

01:14:36.054 --> 01:14:40.564
That Mexican woman
whose handkerchief you touched,

01:14:40.601 --> 01:14:42.851
you healed her husband,
Dean.

01:14:42.895 --> 01:14:45.095
You healed him.

01:14:45.147 --> 01:14:48.687
The cloth,
it carried the power.

01:14:48.734 --> 01:14:53.204
I should have touched
healapalooza hankies, huh?

01:14:53.238 --> 01:14:56.118
Sold them
at the t-shirt booths.

01:14:58.911 --> 01:15:04.961
They're trying to say
that I killed somebody.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.960
That's bullshit.

01:15:08.003 --> 01:15:12.473
They're just coming after me
because of who I am.

01:15:12.508 --> 01:15:14.798
Ariel was a junkie.

01:15:14.843 --> 01:15:17.973
She took a bunch of pills.

01:15:18.013 --> 01:15:20.143
And I did everything I could.

01:15:20.182 --> 01:15:23.522
I thought it was working.

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:28.610
- It's hard to know,
isn't it?

01:15:28.649 --> 01:15:32.899
- Okay. All right.
Let's make it right.

01:15:32.945 --> 01:15:37.655
What can I do for you?
What can I do for your shelter?

01:15:37.699 --> 01:15:41.539
How about this?

01:16:01.890 --> 01:16:05.600
The Lord works
in mysterious ways.

01:16:05.644 --> 01:16:10.194
Think of all those people
you'll be able to help.

01:16:21.577 --> 01:16:25.537
- I-i owe you an apology,
Dean.

01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:33.050
I misused you.
- It's okay. I forgive you.

01:16:33.088 --> 01:16:37.588
You want to help me?
Do this.

01:16:37.634 --> 01:16:41.264
Do this for me.

01:16:44.016 --> 01:16:45.596
- I'll testify for you.

01:16:45.642 --> 01:16:47.732
I'll testify
to the healings that I saw,

01:16:47.769 --> 01:16:48.979
but that's it.

01:16:49.021 --> 01:16:50.311
I won't be
your character witness

01:16:50.355 --> 01:16:51.895
because I-i won't get
on that stand

01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:54.610
and say that...
That your motives were pure.

01:16:54.651 --> 01:16:58.071
- What were my motives?
- I don't know, Dean.

01:16:58.113 --> 01:17:00.703
All I know is that you abandoned
those people

01:17:00.741 --> 01:17:02.031
when they needed you.

01:17:02.075 --> 01:17:05.575
You abandoned them
to become a rock star.

01:17:05.621 --> 01:17:06.871
- That's what you're
gonna say?

01:17:06.913 --> 01:17:09.963
- I'm not gonna lie.
- Oh! No!

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.920
No, you can't lie.
You're too good for that.

01:17:12.961 --> 01:17:14.301
You can't con people.

01:17:14.338 --> 01:17:16.588
You don't use people
for your own glory.

01:17:16.632 --> 01:17:18.262
You don't do anything
like that.

01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:20.090
What if on cross-examination,

01:17:20.135 --> 01:17:23.295
my lawyer asks
what were your motives?

01:17:23.347 --> 01:17:26.097
Two hundred and fifty grand.

01:17:26.141 --> 01:17:28.101
- That has no bearing
on any of this, Dean.

01:17:28.143 --> 01:17:29.370
- Oh, yes, it does.
- No, it doesn't.

01:17:29.394 --> 01:17:31.064
- Oh, yes it does.
- No.

01:17:31.104 --> 01:17:34.654
- You are the inspiration
for this whole thing.

01:17:34.691 --> 01:17:37.691
Paying for miracles.
Where did I get that from?

01:17:37.736 --> 01:17:39.316
So let's just say, father,

01:17:39.363 --> 01:17:41.033
that you're gonna get
on the stand

01:17:41.073 --> 01:17:43.163
and you're gonna tell
the fucking truth.

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:46.160
- The truth is is that you
prostituted your gift.

01:17:46.203 --> 01:17:49.623
- No, the truth
isyouprostitutedme.

01:17:49.665 --> 01:17:52.325
- That is not true.
- Prove it isn't.

01:17:52.376 --> 01:17:53.746
Can you put your hand
on your Bible

01:17:53.794 --> 01:17:55.134
and say you didn't do that?

01:17:55.170 --> 01:17:58.920
- Dean, I have admitted
my wrongs, all right?

01:17:58.965 --> 01:18:00.335
But I am not
gonna repeat them.

01:18:00.384 --> 01:18:02.644
- That's great.

01:18:02.678 --> 01:18:06.138
That's really fucking holy
of you, father.

01:18:21.113 --> 01:18:22.663
I'll see you in hell.

01:18:22.698 --> 01:18:26.698
- Fuck you. Fuck you.
Fuck you!

01:18:26.743 --> 01:18:28.163
Fuck you, Dean o'dwyer.

01:18:28.203 --> 01:18:31.083
You think, what... you think...
You think...

01:18:31.123 --> 01:18:32.963
You think this means anything
to me?

01:18:32.999 --> 01:18:35.039
You think you can buy me?

01:18:35.085 --> 01:18:36.665
You think I'm for sale?

01:18:36.712 --> 01:18:39.172
I'm not like you.

01:18:39.214 --> 01:18:41.344
You're not gonna ruin
my life twice.

01:18:41.383 --> 01:18:44.763
- You sold me out!
For your own fucking sainthood!

01:18:44.803 --> 01:18:46.143
- I tried...

01:18:46.179 --> 01:18:47.889
- And you're doing it again
right now!

01:18:47.931 --> 01:18:49.181
- I tried to save you.

01:18:49.224 --> 01:18:50.864
I tried to give that gift
to the people...

01:18:50.892 --> 01:18:52.078
- You didn't do anything
for me!

01:18:52.102 --> 01:18:53.232
- Who it belongs to.

01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:54.372
Your God-given gift,
my friend.

01:18:54.396 --> 01:18:56.356
- You're a bullshit priest!

01:18:56.398 --> 01:18:59.018
You are a fucking fraud!

01:18:59.067 --> 01:19:01.237
- How dare you.
You are the most selfish...

01:19:01.278 --> 01:19:03.028
- I am out there every night
for the masses!

01:19:03.071 --> 01:19:04.882
You've got a God-given gift.
And what did you do?

01:19:04.906 --> 01:19:07.826
You used it for yourself!
- Is everything all right?

01:19:39.775 --> 01:19:44.355
- Forgive me.

01:19:44.404 --> 01:19:49.744
Excuse me.

01:19:49.785 --> 01:19:52.405
- And that is why you are here
today, father.

01:19:52.454 --> 01:19:54.044
Now, father,
I can't help but notice

01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:57.330
that you are in your civilian
clothes today.

01:19:57.375 --> 01:19:58.875
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

01:19:58.919 --> 01:20:02.919
Now, is there any particular
reason for that?

01:20:02.964 --> 01:20:05.054
- I'm on a leave of absence.
- Okay.

01:20:05.091 --> 01:20:07.511
But you are an ordained
catholic priest

01:20:07.552 --> 01:20:08.892
these past 16 years.

01:20:08.929 --> 01:20:10.099
- That's correct.
- Okay.

01:20:10.138 --> 01:20:12.058
Now, the catholic church
believes

01:20:12.098 --> 01:20:14.058
in hands-on healing.

01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:18.520
It is described as a genuine
gift of the holy spirit.

01:20:18.563 --> 01:20:23.283
So now, father rosselli,
can you, as a modern priest,

01:20:23.318 --> 01:20:25.898
come before us today
and say

01:20:25.946 --> 01:20:30.116
that he has the power
to heal?

01:20:30.158 --> 01:20:32.948
Because it all comes down
to this:

01:20:32.994 --> 01:20:36.124
If Dean o'dwyer cannot heal,

01:20:36.164 --> 01:20:38.794
then this was a show

01:20:38.834 --> 01:20:43.804
and a talented young woman
is dead because of it.

01:20:43.839 --> 01:20:46.799
So, father,

01:20:46.842 --> 01:20:49.972
in your expert opinion,

01:20:50.011 --> 01:20:54.521
does Dean o'dwyer
have the ability to heal?

01:21:02.399 --> 01:21:05.939
- God.

01:21:05.986 --> 01:21:07.316
God is the only healer.

01:21:07.362 --> 01:21:10.162
- Objection, your honor.
Speculation.

01:21:10.198 --> 01:21:11.488
- How can that be speculation

01:21:11.533 --> 01:21:13.163
when I've asked
your own witness to...

01:21:13.201 --> 01:21:16.371
- We are not speaking
of a metaphorical healing here,

01:21:16.413 --> 01:21:17.543
your honor.

01:21:17.581 --> 01:21:19.081
- Order. Order!

01:21:19.124 --> 01:21:20.393
- He is making a mockery
of this court.

01:21:20.417 --> 01:21:21.853
- I'll have order in my court,
counsel.

01:21:21.877 --> 01:21:23.062
- Permission to redirect
the honor...

01:21:23.086 --> 01:21:24.036
- Counsel!
- The witness.

01:21:24.087 --> 01:21:25.047
Your honor, please.

01:22:30.946 --> 01:22:33.156
- What's up?

01:23:02.102 --> 01:23:03.982
- How are you?

01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:11.279
I wanna help you get out of here
as quickly as possible.

01:23:14.322 --> 01:23:17.952
Programs
for disabled prisoners

01:23:17.993 --> 01:23:20.663
are limited obviously,

01:23:20.704 --> 01:23:22.084
but there are some,

01:23:22.122 --> 01:23:23.307
and I think
you should get involved.

01:23:23.331 --> 01:23:27.331
- I got nothing but time
in here.

01:23:27.377 --> 01:23:32.967
And I wanted
to be so pissed at you.

01:23:33.008 --> 01:23:36.468
But all I can think is how bad
I fucked everything up.

01:23:36.511 --> 01:23:40.011
Nah, just take your time,
Dean.

01:23:40.056 --> 01:23:41.636
Keep your nose clean.

01:23:41.683 --> 01:23:45.483
- What the hell
was I thinking?

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:48.730
You know,
what was I doing?

01:23:48.773 --> 01:23:52.483
What was I supposed to do?

01:23:52.527 --> 01:23:55.237
You were supposed
to let the paramedics come up

01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:58.070
and do their job.

01:23:58.116 --> 01:24:00.576
There's... there's one program
in particular

01:24:00.618 --> 01:24:03.998
that I... that I think
you'd be good for.

01:24:04.039 --> 01:24:06.999
It's a... it's a work detail.

01:24:07.042 --> 01:24:09.672
You get to leave prison grounds
to do community service.

01:24:09.711 --> 01:24:15.671
- You know if I got out of here,
I don't know where I'd start.

01:24:15.717 --> 01:24:19.757
I got nothing.

01:24:19.804 --> 01:24:22.104
I can't help myself.

01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:25.770
I can't...

01:24:25.810 --> 01:24:29.020
I need help.

01:24:29.064 --> 01:24:31.524
I need...

01:24:36.237 --> 01:24:38.357
- Sorry, Dean.

01:24:42.744 --> 01:24:47.214
I tried
to control your gift.

01:24:49.334 --> 01:24:55.304
I wanted to be more
than what I was

01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:57.380
and I wanted you
to be someone you weren't.

01:25:02.263 --> 01:25:05.723
I'm not a priest anymore,
Dean.

01:25:10.146 --> 01:25:12.396
- Look...

01:25:16.111 --> 01:25:20.241
I know you thought
you were helping me,

01:25:20.281 --> 01:25:24.741
but nothing helps.

01:25:24.786 --> 01:25:27.246
Maybe you can't help
everybody.

01:25:32.877 --> 01:25:37.087
- No, no. You know what?
You know when you helped me?

01:25:40.885 --> 01:25:43.215
- When you fed me.

01:25:45.807 --> 01:25:50.557
You fed me.

01:25:50.603 --> 01:25:54.153
You fed people.

01:25:57.735 --> 01:26:03.115
A crippled work program?

01:26:03.158 --> 01:26:06.488
What are we going to do?

01:26:09.747 --> 01:26:13.127
- Hang on a second.

01:26:26.389 --> 01:26:29.469
- Get back over here!
- Let's go, gentlemen!

01:26:32.478 --> 01:26:35.308
- Let's move it!
Move it! Come on!

01:27:17.732 --> 01:27:20.402
- That's really nice.
- Huh?

01:27:28.243 --> 01:27:31.543
The shirts.
They pretty nice.

01:27:33.957 --> 01:27:36.497
I like the green.
I like the red.

01:27:36.542 --> 01:27:38.672
I can get both of them
and wear them for Christmas.

01:27:38.711 --> 01:27:44.381
- Yeah.

01:27:44.425 --> 01:27:45.715
- We need the sweaters.

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:47.760
Where are the sweaters?

01:27:47.804 --> 01:27:49.224
- Excuse me.
- Yes. Hello.

01:27:49.264 --> 01:27:52.274
- Hi. Do you carry sweaters?
- Yes.

01:27:52.308 --> 01:27:53.827
- Something for him
with like a tight weave

01:27:53.851 --> 01:27:55.391
and a bright color.

01:27:55.436 --> 01:27:57.596
That'd be great.

01:28:38.313 --> 01:28:39.813
- Do you like these?
The striped one?

01:28:39.856 --> 01:28:42.016
- Oh, yeah, stripped one.
Yeah.

01:28:48.364 --> 01:28:51.704
I'm sorry. You know what?
The... the... let's try the purple.

01:28:51.743 --> 01:28:54.753
- Purple?
- Yeah.

01:28:54.787 --> 01:28:56.997
- Okay. This one?
- Yeah.

01:29:07.592 --> 01:29:10.842
- Nice.
That looks nice.

01:29:10.887 --> 01:29:16.677
- Oh, wow.
Think it's so cool.

01:29:16.726 --> 01:29:19.346
Beautiful.

01:29:29.072 --> 01:29:30.702
Do you like it?
- It's so nice.

01:29:30.740 --> 01:29:31.950
- It looks good?
- So nice.

01:29:31.991 --> 01:29:34.371
- Ho! Ho!
- What?

01:29:34.410 --> 01:29:35.990
- Oh, my.

01:29:36.037 --> 01:29:37.537
- Are you okay?

01:29:37.580 --> 01:29:39.750
- Sweet Jesus.
- No, no.

01:29:39.791 --> 01:29:41.671
- Honey.
Honey, this is it.

01:29:41.709 --> 01:29:42.999
- No.
- This is it. Yes.

01:29:43.044 --> 01:29:45.634
Oh, sweet Jesus. Yes.

01:29:45.671 --> 01:29:46.631
- Yes.
- Yes?

01:29:46.672 --> 01:29:49.802
- Yes?
- Yes! Oh, my.

01:29:49.842 --> 01:29:51.762
- Hallelujah.
- Oh, my gosh.

01:29:51.803 --> 01:29:56.013
- Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!

01:30:13.408 --> 01:30:15.868
- Come on.
Let's go over here.

01:30:47.483 --> 01:30:49.943
- Got it back there?
- Okay, bring him up.

01:30:53.531 --> 01:30:55.781
- Put it back
then lock it down.

01:31:01.622 --> 01:31:06.672
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:31:06.711 --> 01:31:10.761
Who are you?
- O'dwyer.

01:31:10.798 --> 01:31:13.468
- 1264 Paris c.

01:31:13.509 --> 01:31:15.049
- What did you say
your name was again?

01:31:15.094 --> 01:31:19.434
- Just let me
on the bus, man.

01:31:19.474 --> 01:31:21.434
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hold on.

01:31:21.476 --> 01:31:23.704
I don't know what to tell you,
but you're not on the list.

01:31:23.728 --> 01:31:25.438
Look, I don't know
how you got the outfit

01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:27.560
or what kind of prank
you're trying to pull here,

01:31:27.607 --> 01:31:29.147
but this
is a state facility bus

01:31:29.192 --> 01:31:31.442
and these are convicted
prisoners.

01:31:31.486 --> 01:31:33.776
So what you're doing here
is not a joke,

01:31:33.821 --> 01:31:34.991
it's actually a crime.

01:31:35.031 --> 01:31:37.571
- All right, that's funny.

01:31:37.617 --> 01:31:39.447
- What, have you lost
your mind?

01:31:39.494 --> 01:31:42.874
I have seen everything now.
You better run along.

01:31:42.914 --> 01:31:44.754
Look at this.

01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:46.040
It's so bad out here,

01:31:46.083 --> 01:31:47.833
we got a guy begging
to come with you.

01:31:47.877 --> 01:31:50.837
- All right.

01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:52.550
I'll tell you what,

01:31:52.590 --> 01:31:55.720
you go do like a stick up
or something like that

01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:58.090
and we'll find a seat
for you, okay?

01:31:58.137 --> 01:32:01.807
- Okay.
- Let's go.

01:33:24.765 --> 01:33:28.725
Ha!

01:33:37.612 --> 01:33:38.652
Hey, man.

01:34:07.391 --> 01:34:09.271
Hey, man, how much
is this?

01:34:09.310 --> 01:34:14.110
- You can have that shit
for free, man.

01:34:14.148 --> 01:34:18.108
- Are you sure?

01:34:18.152 --> 01:34:23.622
Hey, thanks, man.
Really.

01:34:23.658 --> 01:34:26.658
