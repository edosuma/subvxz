WEBVTT

00:00.830 --> 00:01.660
Look,don't worry.

00:01.680 --> 00:02.800
You'll grow into it.

00:02.830 --> 00:04.640
Just once I'd like to
get clothes that fit now.

00:04.680 --> 00:07.760
Yeah,well,quit going through
puberty and we'll talk about it.

00:08.270 --> 00:10.920
Quit being so cheap,and
we'll talk about it.

00:11.490 --> 00:13.640
Hey,hey,watch your mouth.

00:14.090 --> 00:16.590
Hard to punish him
for telling the truth.

00:16.650 --> 00:17.200
Oh,yeah?

00:17.220 --> 00:19.560
Wait till he tries on the
underwear I bought him.

00:22.240 --> 00:23.370
What's that?

00:23.410 --> 00:24.470
Uh,decorative bowl.

00:24.510 --> 00:26.670
I thought it'd be perfect
to put our keys in.

00:26.720 --> 00:28.780
Yeah,well,I don't like it.

00:28.800 --> 00:30.300
Take it back.

00:30.400 --> 00:32.000
But it was on sale.

00:32.060 --> 00:36.260
I don't care if you got it free with a
paid subscription to ugly bowl illustrated.

00:41.200 --> 00:42.810
I don't want it on my table.

00:42.820 --> 00:43.670
Why not?

00:44.120 --> 00:45.430
"Why not?"

00:45.450 --> 00:46.630
Look around.

00:46.660 --> 00:48.740
It doesn't fit the decor.

00:50.390 --> 00:51.960
Decor?

00:52.200 --> 00:54.890
You,uh,you call this "decor"?

00:55.710 --> 00:57.280
What would you call it?

00:57.340 --> 00:59.220
Random crapola.

01:00.880 --> 01:04.459
The deep sea helmet,the
fake jazz posters.

01:04.500 --> 01:09.170
Add an old snow sled and a couple of baseball
pennants and you can open a T.G.I. Fridays.

01:09.620 --> 01:13.310
Excuse me,but everything in
this house has a story behind it.

01:13.350 --> 01:14.410
Oh,really?

01:14.450 --> 01:18.870
Oh,so what's the story
behind this urn thing?

01:19.020 --> 01:21.050
Some girl gave that to me.

01:21.090 --> 01:22.050
That's it?

01:22.070 --> 01:23.850
She spent the weekend.

01:23.970 --> 01:25.700
Ooh,great story.

01:25.740 --> 01:27.500
No,great weekend.

01:28.480 --> 01:30.980
Okay,okay,what about,uh...

01:31.040 --> 01:33.930
this umbrella stand
that has no umbrellas?

01:33.960 --> 01:35.390
A girl gave me that,too.

01:35.450 --> 01:36.210
Another great weekend?

01:36.250 --> 01:38.140
Not so great. It was raining.

01:38.920 --> 01:41.930
All right,why don't you just
pretend a girl gave you this bowl?

01:42.010 --> 01:43.230
It doesn't work that way.

01:43.260 --> 01:47.120
You'd have to wear high heels and give
it to me naked,and nobody wants that.

01:48.920 --> 01:50.570
Fine. Whatever.

01:50.660 --> 01:52.130
I like the bowl.

01:52.600 --> 01:55.250
Okay,alan,you're not feeling me.

01:55.280 --> 01:58.690
I don't want your bowl on my table.

01:58.740 --> 02:00.700
So I can't even have one
stupid thing in this house?

02:00.750 --> 02:02.970
Hey,leave jake out of this.

02:08.759 --> 02:10.590
Very funny-- you
know what I mean.

02:10.669 --> 02:12.270
Actually,I don'T.

02:12.790 --> 02:16.050
The fact is,this house
reeks of you and your crap.

02:16.080 --> 02:17.200
Oh,really? Like what?

02:17.220 --> 02:18.740
Like this lamp.

02:18.740 --> 02:20.640
You bought this lamp--
I hate this lamp.

02:20.670 --> 02:23.130
Then why didn't you just say something
when I bought it two years ago?

02:23.170 --> 02:25.940
Because I didn't notice
it until recently.

02:27.860 --> 02:29.310
And the couch.

02:29.360 --> 02:32.060
You reupholstered the couch,and
I liked it better the way it was.

02:32.110 --> 02:33.350
Stained?

02:33.410 --> 02:36.850
Hey,every one of those
stains had a story behind it.

02:42.220 --> 02:45.170
What I'm saying is,you got
nothing to complain about.

02:45.190 --> 02:46.920
You got your food in my refrigerator,

02:46.930 --> 02:51.090
your car in my garage and your stupid
flowered towels in my guest bathroom.

02:51.130 --> 02:52.540
Hey,those towels are very pretty.

02:52.560 --> 02:53.910
They brighten up the whole room.

02:53.920 --> 02:57.140
They're gay,and they
scream "civil union."

02:57.200 --> 02:58.370
Oh,they do not!

02:58.390 --> 03:01.420
"We're here,we're
queer,dry your hands on us."

03:03.050 --> 03:04.650
Okay,okay,you know what?

03:04.680 --> 03:05.900
You are being ridiculous.

03:05.910 --> 03:08.820
When you want to have a rational
conversation,I'll be in my room.

03:08.860 --> 03:10.680
It's not your room.

03:10.710 --> 03:12.140
It's my guestroom.

03:12.180 --> 03:15.120
Oh,well,obviously,we disagree
about my role in this household.

03:15.170 --> 03:16.390
We sure do.

03:16.480 --> 03:18.100
You think you have one...

03:18.140 --> 03:19.680
and I don'T.

03:21.480 --> 03:24.840
and get rid of that welcome
mat you put on my front porch!

03:26.290 --> 03:28.280
No one's welcome here.

03:56.740 --> 04:00.960
charlie, I'm telling you right now
I'm not gonna sleep with you tonight.

04:02.960 --> 04:04.570
Where'd that come from?

04:05.480 --> 04:07.680
Buy you a couple of drinks,invite
you back to my house,

04:07.710 --> 04:10.230
and all of a sudden you think
I want to sleep with you?

04:11.350 --> 04:13.730
You mean,you don't?

04:13.740 --> 04:15.580
Hey,we just met.

04:15.630 --> 04:17.730
Let's talk,get to know each other.

04:17.800 --> 04:20.850
If later down the
road,something happens,great.

04:20.880 --> 04:23.720
If not,we've each made a new friend.

04:24.360 --> 04:25.790
That is very sweet.

04:25.830 --> 04:30.730
Well,my mother raised me to be respectful
of women,and I've always said...

04:30.770 --> 04:33.040
son of a bitch!

04:36.430 --> 04:37.910
What?

04:38.990 --> 04:40.050
That.

04:40.110 --> 04:41.700
That's what.

04:42.030 --> 04:43.660
Butterscotch candies?

04:43.700 --> 04:47.380
In about 30 seconds,they're gonna
be butterscotch suppositories.

04:57.440 --> 04:59.440
so you noticed it.

04:59.770 --> 05:01.740
Maybe I didn't make myself clear.

05:01.780 --> 05:04.490
I don't want this stupid
bowl in my living room.

05:04.550 --> 05:07.750
No,you said you didn't want
it on the front table for keys.

05:07.770 --> 05:10.440
So I put it on the
coffee table for candy.

05:10.510 --> 05:14.420
Yeah,well,now it's on
your head for a hat.

05:17.430 --> 05:18.220
I am sorry.

05:18.250 --> 05:19.440
I had to set my brother straight.

05:19.450 --> 05:21.260
I don't know why you're making
such a big deal out of this.

05:21.300 --> 05:22.700
It is a nice bowl.

05:22.760 --> 05:25.940
It is a hideous bowl that makes
me nauseous just to look at it.

05:25.960 --> 05:27.960
You're being ridiculous--
isn't this a nice bowl?

05:28.000 --> 05:28.610
It's okay.

05:28.630 --> 05:29.980
See? Two against one.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.120
No,no,no. No,there's no voting.

05:32.130 --> 05:35.960
You're just a freeloader,and she's just
some one-night stand I picked up in a ba...

05:36.000 --> 05:37.350
damn!

05:39.290 --> 05:40.260
Good-bye,charlie.

05:40.280 --> 05:41.350
Oh,come on.

05:41.370 --> 05:43.150
Don't leave.

05:43.310 --> 05:44.810
You know what the worst part is?

05:44.830 --> 05:47.160
I actually believed the things you said.

05:47.190 --> 05:48.740
You're kidding?

05:52.790 --> 05:54.050
Thanks a lot.

05:54.070 --> 05:54.720
What did I do?

05:54.740 --> 05:56.480
You just made me blow a sure thing.

05:56.500 --> 05:57.940
She didn't look like a sure thing to me.

05:57.950 --> 05:59.940
I could have brought her around.

05:59.970 --> 06:01.570
Okay. Why don't we just admit it?

06:01.590 --> 06:03.530
This isn't about the bowl,and
this isn't about the girl.

06:03.550 --> 06:05.360
This is about my place in this house.

06:05.380 --> 06:08.600
No,no,it is about the
bowl,it is about the girl,

06:08.620 --> 06:10.470
and you have no place in this house.

06:10.510 --> 06:11.880
Oh,you really believe that?

06:11.900 --> 06:13.360
What do you want from me,alan?

06:13.370 --> 06:15.210
I took you in; I took your kid in.

06:15.220 --> 06:18.090
All I ask is you don't fill
up my home with your junk!

06:18.110 --> 06:19.130
It's not
junk--

06:19.140 --> 06:22.820
it's an inlaid mosaic dish
handcrafted on the island of macao.

06:23.080 --> 06:24.550
Yeah,well...

06:28.300 --> 06:31.120
now it's rubble from
the island of macao.

06:34.990 --> 06:36.570
I hope you're happy.

06:36.600 --> 06:37.590
Really?

06:37.610 --> 06:39.250
I don't think you do.

06:40.680 --> 06:42.330
Let me tell you something,charlie.

06:42.360 --> 06:45.620
You said you took me and my kid
into your home,but you didn'T.

06:45.640 --> 06:47.510
You took us into your house.

06:47.550 --> 06:48.640
We made it a home.

06:48.670 --> 06:51.110
- Is that so?
- Yes,that's so.

06:51.120 --> 06:53.940
Before we got here,this was just a big
empty space where you just sat around,

06:53.950 --> 06:56.900
got drunk and had casual sex with
women you don't even care about.

06:56.920 --> 06:59.870
There was no love,no
family and no meaning.

06:59.910 --> 07:03.570
There's a word for that,alan: Utopia.

07:05.280 --> 07:06.200
I heard something break.

07:06.210 --> 07:07.660
And you're just coming out now?

07:07.690 --> 07:10.150
I was establishing my alibi.

07:13.040 --> 07:14.490
Go pack your stuff. We're leaving.

07:14.520 --> 07:16.450
But I have an alibi.

07:17.820 --> 07:19.680
You're my son. Where I go,you go.

07:19.700 --> 07:22.390
I don't remember that
in the custody agreement.

07:30.800 --> 07:32.220
okay,we're leaving.

07:32.560 --> 07:34.220
Say good-bye to your uncle charlie.

07:34.250 --> 07:35.790
Bye,uncle charlie.

07:35.910 --> 07:37.170
You don't have to go,jake.

07:37.200 --> 07:38.640
See?

07:40.180 --> 07:41.490
Get in the car.

07:41.550 --> 07:43.490
But he likes me.

07:44.600 --> 07:46.230
I'm not bluffing,charlie.

07:47.460 --> 07:50.300
if you're not willing to acknowledge
me as an equal member of this household,

07:50.310 --> 07:53.240
then I can't live here anymore.

07:54.360 --> 07:56.940
is that all it'll take
to get you to stay?

07:57.190 --> 07:58.460
Yes.

07:58.710 --> 08:00.300
Buh-bye.

08:07.850 --> 08:08.730
so...

08:08.760 --> 08:10.830
this is about a bowl.

08:10.850 --> 08:12.430
No,the bowl is a symbol.

08:12.470 --> 08:13.120
Of what?

08:13.140 --> 08:14.510
How your uncle charlie treats us.

08:14.530 --> 08:16.090
- He treats me fine.
- No,he doesn'T.

08:16.110 --> 08:17.570
Yeah,he does.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.050
Okay,I don't want to
talk about this anymore.

08:21.080 --> 08:24.550
How come when I don't want to talk about
stuff,we still have to talk about it?

08:24.770 --> 08:26.360
Just be quiet.

08:29.080 --> 08:31.730
So,uh... we going to a hotel?

08:32.289 --> 08:34.179
We don't need hotels,buddy.

08:34.350 --> 08:38.240
We're two single guys on the open
road,footloose and fancy-free.

08:38.309 --> 08:40.510
The whole world is at our feet.

08:42.679 --> 08:45.440
If you're too cheap for a
hotel,I call the back seat.

08:52.970 --> 08:54.210
Hello?

08:54.250 --> 08:55.490
Hi,mom.

08:57.750 --> 08:59.360
Hi,grandma.

09:00.290 --> 09:01.290
It's late.

09:01.340 --> 09:03.000
What do you want?

09:03.030 --> 09:05.050
Charlie and i had a fight.

09:05.070 --> 09:06.530
Jake and I need a place to sleep.

09:06.550 --> 09:08.110
Only 'cause he's too cheap to get A...

09:08.160 --> 09:09.910
we need a place to sleep.

09:10.960 --> 09:12.730
We have nowhere else to go.

09:12.760 --> 09:15.080
Oh,wonderful.

09:15.150 --> 09:16.860
Be right there.

09:17.760 --> 09:19.800
Are you sure we can't sleep in the car?

09:23.440 --> 09:26.780
*****no place in his house.

09:26.820 --> 09:27.460
Can you believe it?

09:27.480 --> 09:28.400
My own brother.

09:28.440 --> 09:29.920
He likes me.

09:31.020 --> 09:34.460
Hey,when I want your
opinion,I'll ask for it.

09:35.140 --> 09:38.900
And then I said that if he's not willing to acknowledge
me as an equal member of the household,then...

09:38.930 --> 09:41.410
I can't live there anymore.

09:41.450 --> 09:42.800
So...

09:43.490 --> 09:45.590
this is about a bowl?

09:46.550 --> 09:47.390
No.

09:47.430 --> 09:48.640
Haven't you been listening?

09:48.680 --> 09:50.180
Frankly,no.

09:50.760 --> 09:53.590
Don't feel bad-- I thought
it was about a bowl,too.

09:55.050 --> 09:56.500
So look,alan.

09:56.550 --> 09:58.710
I just got back from
a long business trip,

09:58.740 --> 10:05.230
and your mom and i were
about to...catch up.

10:06.760 --> 10:09.640
Would you like to sleep in
your father's car tonight?

10:09.650 --> 10:11.500
Actually,yes.

10:12.690 --> 10:13.940
Look,look,uh...

10:13.960 --> 10:15.290
we're sorry for barging in.

10:15.300 --> 10:17.080
Jake and I will just
bunk in the guest room.

10:17.110 --> 10:17.840
Come on.

10:19.130 --> 10:22.900
You know,I'm really getting tired
of this "where I go,you go" stuff.

10:25.220 --> 10:26.050
Oh,great.

10:26.090 --> 10:29.270
Now we have to put on
clothes for breakfast.

10:29.850 --> 10:32.620
That's the least of our problems.

10:33.660 --> 10:36.840
All our leather gear
is in the guest room.

10:47.450 --> 10:48.820
morning.

10:49.170 --> 10:50.020
Morning.

10:50.050 --> 10:54.770
I couldn't help but notice the guys from
goodwill hauling away alan's hide-a-bed.

10:55.030 --> 10:56.410
Oh,yeah.

10:56.470 --> 10:58.140
He doesn't live here anymore.

10:58.190 --> 10:59.330
No kidding.

10:59.380 --> 11:00.810
Alan's gone?

11:00.860 --> 11:01.710
Yep.

11:03.580 --> 11:07.720
So you couldn't think for even a
second that I might want a hide-a-bed?

11:10.290 --> 11:11.710
Sorry.

11:11.940 --> 11:13.610
You want some flowered towels?

11:13.630 --> 11:15.190
Pass.

11:15.730 --> 11:18.200
So what broke you two love birds up?

11:18.240 --> 11:19.480
He crossed a line.

11:19.520 --> 11:21.040
Must've been a big one.

11:21.070 --> 11:22.620
Very big.

11:22.760 --> 11:23.750
Was it money?

11:23.810 --> 11:24.650
Worse.

11:24.660 --> 11:25.420
A woman?

11:25.440 --> 11:26.080
Worse.

11:26.110 --> 11:27.830
What's worse than money and women?

11:29.070 --> 11:33.490
He bought an ugly bowl and
put it on the front table.

11:35.630 --> 11:37.510
No.

11:38.140 --> 11:40.510
Then,when I told him to get rid of it,

11:40.540 --> 11:42.920
he filled it with candy and
put it on the coffee table.

11:42.950 --> 11:45.040
Dear god.

11:47.360 --> 11:48.810
What kind of candy?

11:48.830 --> 11:50.170
Butterscotch.

11:51.950 --> 11:54.340
I mean,the son of bitch.

11:56.300 --> 11:57.640
Are you making fun of me?

11:57.660 --> 11:59.190
I'm trying.

11:59.980 --> 12:00.580
So,what?

12:00.620 --> 12:02.090
You think I should just let him...

12:02.120 --> 12:04.240
put a candy dish wherever he wants?

12:04.290 --> 12:06.140
No,you're right.

12:06.170 --> 12:08.070
He obviously had to go.

12:08.120 --> 12:10.950
He's an ungrateful parasite
who overstepped his boundaries.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.010
Exactly.

12:12.040 --> 12:13.180
While,you,on the other hand,

12:13.230 --> 12:17.960
are a completely reasonable man
with no control issues whatsoever.

12:18.130 --> 12:19.630
I don't pay you to mock me.

12:19.660 --> 12:22.290
Charlie,you'd have to pay me not to.

12:32.550 --> 12:33.780
fruit.

12:33.830 --> 12:36.020
That's all you got,fruit?

12:36.210 --> 12:38.610
Don't you ever have fruit for breakfast?

12:38.660 --> 12:41.180
Well,yeah,franken berries.

12:42.150 --> 12:43.460
Well,I'm sorry,sweetheart.

12:43.480 --> 12:46.980
If I had known you were coming,I
would have stocked up on crap.

12:47.130 --> 12:49.620
Well,maybe we can go
crap shopping later.

12:50.390 --> 12:51.770
So,um...

12:51.830 --> 12:52.650
what's the plan?

12:52.690 --> 12:55.930
You gonna patch things up
with your brother and...

12:56.910 --> 12:58.290
go home?

12:59.190 --> 13:00.640
Not until he apologizes.

13:00.690 --> 13:03.110
- Oh,sweet lord.
- Aw,geez.

13:03.410 --> 13:05.550
Don't worry,I'll find my own place.

13:05.600 --> 13:07.340
We'll only be here a few days,tops.

13:07.370 --> 13:08.340
Yeah,right.

13:08.370 --> 13:11.430
That's what you told uncle
charlie when we moved there.

13:12.710 --> 13:13.980
Hey,if you'll remember,

13:14.050 --> 13:16.490
when judith and I broke up,you
were begging me to live here.

13:16.530 --> 13:20.880
Yes,well,I didn't have a boyfriend
then and jake was still cute.

13:22.730 --> 13:26.190
Alan,can we have a
little man-to-man?

13:26.900 --> 13:28.180
Sure.

13:31.960 --> 13:34.550
I'm just going through an awkward stage.

13:34.690 --> 13:36.130
You hope.

13:40.990 --> 13:43.280
Alan,I know how you feel.

13:43.310 --> 13:45.300
I had an older brother,too.

13:45.390 --> 13:45.940
Really?

13:45.960 --> 13:47.320
Yep.

13:47.330 --> 13:48.760
Scotty.

13:48.780 --> 13:50.150
I worshiped him.

13:50.170 --> 13:52.610
But ever since I can remember,

13:52.650 --> 13:55.310
he did everything he could
to make my life miserable.

13:55.350 --> 13:57.180
That's my life with charlie.

13:57.210 --> 13:58.880
No kidding.

13:58.920 --> 14:01.280
Then maybe my experience can help you.

14:02.040 --> 14:04.880
When my parents died,scotty took me in.

14:04.910 --> 14:07.000
It was just the two of us.

14:07.070 --> 14:12.350
Then one day I got so angry with the
way he was treating me,I walked out.

14:12.380 --> 14:17.190
I haven't seen or talked to him
in,I don't know,maybe 35 years.

14:17.400 --> 14:18.980
- Wow.
- Yep.

14:19.020 --> 14:20.970
I don't know where he lives.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.880
I don't know whether he's alive or dead.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.850
All I do know is he's the only
family I have left in the world

14:28.890 --> 14:31.230
and despite all the bad stuff,

14:31.290 --> 14:33.920
I want him back in my life.

14:35.110 --> 14:37.270
But it's too late for me.

14:39.700 --> 14:43.040
I'm not going back to
charlie's unless he apologizes.

14:44.450 --> 14:45.100
Yeah.

14:45.160 --> 14:47.710
That's what I said
about my brother artie.

14:48.040 --> 14:49.860
I thought his name was scotty.

14:52.460 --> 14:54.380
I had two brothers.

15:07.160 --> 15:08.870
what are you doing?

15:09.370 --> 15:10.580
Just...

15:10.680 --> 15:11.870
looking.

15:11.920 --> 15:13.730
You miss him,don't you?

15:14.520 --> 15:17.820
No,I'm trying to figure out if
there's room for a pool table.

15:29.650 --> 15:30.490
oh,hey,teddy.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.240
Charlie,got a minute?

15:32.280 --> 15:33.020
Sure,I guess.

15:33.070 --> 15:34.260
Come on in.

15:34.530 --> 15:35.510
Thanks.

15:35.570 --> 15:38.260
Hey,what about air
hockey and a wet bar...

15:38.290 --> 15:39.750
hello

15:40.640 --> 15:41.690
how are ya?

15:41.770 --> 15:43.470
Better now.

15:44.420 --> 15:45.780
Charlie?

15:45.950 --> 15:46.730
What?

15:46.790 --> 15:48.940
Introduce us,you pork-head.

15:48.960 --> 15:49.740
Oh,sorry.

15:49.760 --> 15:51.520
Berta,this is my mom's boyfriend,teddy.

15:51.570 --> 15:53.330
Teddy,my housekeeper,berta.

15:53.400 --> 15:54.010
A pleasure.

15:54.040 --> 15:56.790
It could be if you
play your cards right.

16:06.350 --> 16:07.360
You'll be fine.

16:07.410 --> 16:10.770
- Just don't wander into the laundry room without backup.
- Fine.

16:10.800 --> 16:11.450
Listen.

16:11.460 --> 16:13.360
I got a situation
here with your brother.

16:13.400 --> 16:14.180
I'm sorry,teddy.

16:14.200 --> 16:16.170
He cannot come back until he apologizes.

16:16.200 --> 16:19.830
- I understand,but the thing is...
- did he tell you about the bowl?

16:19.930 --> 16:21.310
Repeatedly.

16:21.360 --> 16:23.330
And I know what you're going through.

16:23.370 --> 16:24.970
I had a younger brother,too.

16:25.020 --> 16:25.560
Really?

16:25.580 --> 16:27.150
Yeah,scotty.

16:27.950 --> 16:32.870
A worthless sponge who lived off me for
years and never showed any appreciation.

16:32.880 --> 16:35.010
That's my life with alan.

16:35.040 --> 16:36.280
No kidding.

16:36.720 --> 16:39.740
Well then,maybe my
experience could help you.

16:40.220 --> 16:41.950
When my parents died...

16:41.990 --> 16:44.350
I took scotty in,and...

16:45.450 --> 16:49.010
here's your father when he was
going through his awkward stage.

16:49.030 --> 16:50.480
He looks exactly the same.

16:50.500 --> 16:54.080
Which is why we can't count
on you growing out of it.

16:55.000 --> 17:00.960
Here's your uncle charlie in front of the
beverly hills courthouse when he was about 17.

17:00.970 --> 17:02.760
What's he look so happy about?

17:02.780 --> 17:04.599
Being tried as a minor.

17:07.040 --> 17:10.950
Here's one of grandmommy
on a cruise to mazatlan.

17:11.020 --> 17:13.119
Who's that lady with her arm around you?

17:13.150 --> 17:17.210
Well,darling,after your
grandfather passed away,

17:17.220 --> 17:19.589
grandmommy wanted to
explore her sexuality...

17:19.609 --> 17:21.329
mom! Mom!

17:23.260 --> 17:25.089
What are you doing? He's only 13.

17:25.130 --> 17:26.579
Oh,please!

17:26.599 --> 17:30.810
When I was 13,I was in an all-girls
boarding school,and we were quite familiar...

17:30.830 --> 17:32.380
mom!

17:32.910 --> 17:34.130
Hey.

17:34.920 --> 17:36.230
So?

17:37.930 --> 17:40.080
- No luck.
- Damn.

17:40.100 --> 17:41.270
What's wrong?

17:41.460 --> 17:43.850
Uh,everything's fine,darling.

17:43.950 --> 17:45.930
Why don't we talk in the other room?

17:47.630 --> 17:50.350
Last time I heard that,I
ended up in bible camp.

17:54.120 --> 17:55.610
they sound angry.

17:55.640 --> 17:56.730
Yeah.

17:59.110 --> 18:01.350
What do you think they're arguing about?

18:01.370 --> 18:02.830
I don't know.

18:02.870 --> 18:05.680
Maybe teddy found out
grandma's part lesbian.

18:19.260 --> 18:21.480
teddy and I had a fight.

18:27.800 --> 18:31.240
Anyway,I'm sorry.

18:32.180 --> 18:36.930
I love you,and I miss you,and
I want you to come back.

18:37.080 --> 18:40.220
What if I want to put a
bowl on the coffee table?

18:53.100 --> 18:55.810
Nothing would make me happier.

18:58.170 --> 19:02.650
As soon as they leave,I'm tearing
off your clothes with my teeth.

19:05.050 --> 19:06.700
Terrific.

19:10.980 --> 19:14.550
*****He other one.

19:14.570 --> 19:15.600
Good.

19:16.740 --> 19:18.570
It wasn't even on sale.

19:18.620 --> 19:19.660
- No kidding.
- Yep.

19:19.700 --> 19:21.150
Paid full retail.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.990
$14.99

19:26.180 --> 19:28.740
anyway,I'm gonna go unpack.

19:29.080 --> 19:29.820
You need some help?

19:29.860 --> 19:31.380
No,I'm good.

19:33.630 --> 19:34.590
Hey,charlie.

19:34.640 --> 19:35.660
Yeah?

19:35.870 --> 19:41.360
From the bottom of my heart,thank
you for being the bigger man here.

19:41.570 --> 19:43.280
Don't mention it.

19:46.320 --> 19:51.080
Our house is a very,very,very fine house

19:51.100 --> 19:53.750
with two cats in the yard

19:53.780 --> 19:56.650
life used to be so hard

19:56.670 --> 19:59.700
now everything is easy 'cause...

20:04.910 --> 20:11.090
my house in the middle
of my street my house.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.520
butterscotch.
