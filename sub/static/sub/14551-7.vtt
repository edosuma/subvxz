00:15.091 --> 00:17.091
Previously on Powers...

00:18.468 --> 00:19.970
I shouldn't have done what I did.

00:20.051 --> 00:23.923
Are you talking about locking
me in a cell or taking Sway?

00:23.957 --> 00:24.957
Is it real?

00:24.959 --> 00:27.043
I made the Sway from Wolfe's blood.

00:27.043 --> 00:28.211
So fucking what?

00:28.280 --> 00:30.444
It let Walker take Wolfe's power.

00:30.445 --> 00:32.444
You told me you wanted to be an A-lister.

00:32.692 --> 00:33.693
Model yourself after one.

00:34.493 --> 00:36.492
I got them back, Janice.

00:36.569 --> 00:38.568
- What?
- I had my powers again.

00:38.569 --> 00:39.612
When I touched Wolfe,

00:39.737 --> 00:42.568
it was like I was sucking
my powers back out of him.

00:42.569 --> 00:43.769
I threw him through the floor.

00:45.569 --> 00:48.568
I tossed him into his cell.

00:48.569 --> 00:50.569
When he was under the
drainer, my power disappeared.

00:51.569 --> 00:53.569
I felt myself being emptied out.

00:55.569 --> 00:56.568
What did you just feel?

00:56.569 --> 00:59.568
I felt hunger.

00:59.569 --> 01:01.568
No one goes in without me.

01:01.569 --> 01:05.568
Only when my powers are drained permanently

01:05.569 --> 01:06.570
will the world be safe.

01:06.695 --> 01:08.737
This is my deepest wish,

01:08.862 --> 01:13.569
and I humbly ask the courts to grant it.

01:31.569 --> 01:35.112
Hmm... Now, how does this go again?

01:38.569 --> 01:43.568
The flower. God, the flower.

01:43.569 --> 01:45.568
Always the same fucking thing.

01:45.569 --> 01:48.568
... the mass murderer Wolfe
made his shocking plea,

01:48.569 --> 01:50.568
the possibility of permanently draining him

01:50.569 --> 01:54.196
has become a polarizing
lightning rod for public opinion.

01:54.321 --> 01:56.569
In an effort to quell
a rising tide of unrest,

01:56.653 --> 01:58.653
Superior Court Judge Stephen Tanaka

01:58.779 --> 02:00.569
is expected to make his ruling today.

02:01.569 --> 02:04.568
Meanwhile, a legal team
assembled and financed

02:04.569 --> 02:08.568
by the mysterious and
notorious Johnny Royalle...

02:08.568 --> 02:10.568
... is conniving to arrange a
humanitarian visit with Wolfe.

02:10.568 --> 02:11.862
Enough of this shit.

02:14.569 --> 02:19.568
My record for standing up for
Powers' rights is well established.

02:19.569 --> 02:21.904
So is your prison record.

02:22.029 --> 02:24.446
I spent three years in the Shaft

02:24.569 --> 02:26.569
for protesting registration laws.

02:28.569 --> 02:30.321
I'm a known humanitarian.

02:31.569 --> 02:34.568
Johnny, as your lawyer,

02:34.569 --> 02:37.568
I want nothing more than
to accrue billable hours.

02:37.569 --> 02:39.568
But until we can establish for a fact

02:39.569 --> 02:41.568
that the Drainer is physically harmful,

02:41.569 --> 02:44.568
you don't have a prayer of
getting in there to see Wolfe.

02:44.569 --> 02:45.568
Johnny!

02:45.569 --> 02:49.568
Oh, Johnny. Thank goodness.
Mind if I join you?

02:49.569 --> 02:51.569
One restraining order
isn't enough, Detective?

02:51.612 --> 02:54.568
I don't believe we've met. I'm Christian.

02:54.569 --> 02:55.569
It's okay, Patrice.

02:57.569 --> 02:59.196
You and I are leaving.

02:59.321 --> 03:01.569
So soon, Johnny? No, come on, buddy. Huh?

03:02.569 --> 03:03.569
Stay.

03:05.569 --> 03:08.237
Why do you wanna talk to Wolfe, Johnny?

03:08.362 --> 03:09.568
I wanna ask him how he feels.

03:09.569 --> 03:11.237
Bullshit.

03:11.362 --> 03:13.529
What can he possibly tell you
now that he couldn't have told you

03:13.569 --> 03:16.569
if you'd just broke him
out when you had the chance?

03:16.820 --> 03:18.569
What are you up to, Johnny?

03:19.987 --> 03:23.737
You know, it would be a real
shame if my control were to falter

03:23.862 --> 03:28.569
and by mischance I teleported
away with your hand.

03:32.446 --> 03:36.569
Whatever you do, Christian, don't move.

03:44.071 --> 03:46.568
Uh... Can I get anything for you, sir?

03:46.569 --> 03:48.568
Yeah, yeah, coffee. Strong.

03:48.569 --> 03:51.568
Okay. Right away.

03:51.569 --> 03:56.568
Wait. Two coffees. One
with soy milk to go, please.

03:56.569 --> 03:57.569
Right away.

04:33.605 --> 04:34.648
There you are.

04:42.524 --> 04:44.605
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:46.605 --> 04:49.273
- It's coffee.
- I'm familiar with coffee.

04:49.605 --> 04:51.605
- It's for you.
- Why?

04:52.981 --> 04:55.604
It's got soy milk. Like you like.

04:55.605 --> 04:56.605
I like whole milk.

05:00.565 --> 05:02.604
But thanks for the effort.

05:02.605 --> 05:05.604
You wanna see something cool?

05:05.605 --> 05:11.232
Calista Renata-Gene Secor,
resident of Las Vegas, Nevada.

05:11.357 --> 05:13.604
- No shit.
- Mmm-hmm.

05:13.605 --> 05:16.604
Couldn't find any good matches
on her with Missing Persons.

05:16.605 --> 05:19.604
But taking into account her
tendency to run with shitty people,

05:19.605 --> 05:21.604
I started looking for a criminal record.

05:21.605 --> 05:23.273
That's good cop shit.

05:29.605 --> 05:31.731
So, partner...

05:31.898 --> 05:34.148
Yeah?

05:35.605 --> 05:37.605
I wanna talk to Wolfe.

05:38.898 --> 05:41.604
You wanna... What the fuck?

05:41.605 --> 05:45.604
I wanna know why Royalle
was teleporting in there

05:45.605 --> 05:47.604
without getting him out.

05:47.605 --> 05:49.604
That's what you wanna talk to him about?

05:49.605 --> 05:50.689
Yeah.

05:50.815 --> 05:52.107
I...

05:52.605 --> 05:54.232
I wanna bust Royalle.

05:55.314 --> 05:58.565
Okay. Can I show you some things?

06:00.398 --> 06:01.605
Huh?

06:06.023 --> 06:07.604
Ah. Wow!

06:07.605 --> 06:09.605
We have a Drainer.

06:10.605 --> 06:12.604
Hey, Kutter. How's your face?

06:12.605 --> 06:14.190
How's your elbow?

06:14.315 --> 06:15.604
I've been hit harder by girls.

06:15.605 --> 06:16.604
I believe you.

06:16.605 --> 06:18.604
Gentlemen.

06:18.605 --> 06:21.604
The two Powerz Kidz were
flashing their shit in public.

06:21.605 --> 06:23.604
- Sway eyes?
- Both of 'em.

06:23.605 --> 06:26.107
Powers were way over
their registered profiles.

06:26.232 --> 06:27.605
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

06:29.605 --> 06:32.981
Hey. What did they catch you for?

06:34.605 --> 06:36.605
I'm as fast as a cheetah.
No one can catch me.

06:37.605 --> 06:39.315
Smash-and-grabbed a jewelry store,

06:39.440 --> 06:41.605
sprinted off at 40 miles per, and tripped.

06:43.605 --> 06:46.604
You never would have caught me
if my laces hadn't come untied.

06:46.605 --> 06:47.645
Double knot 'em next time.

06:49.605 --> 06:51.357
Let's peek in on orientation.

06:54.605 --> 06:56.604
We get the Drainer, a little good press,

06:56.605 --> 06:59.604
suddenly every Metro cop out
there wants to be Powers Division.

06:59.605 --> 07:01.604
Fucking assholes.

07:01.605 --> 07:04.604
Another day with us and they'll
know what an asshole really is.

07:04.605 --> 07:09.731
New guys, allow me to introduce
you to the effects of Sway.

07:09.856 --> 07:14.604
The reward for anyone without
powers is instant death.

07:14.605 --> 07:17.604
Low level Powers like
Chromachron and Dem Femmes here

07:17.605 --> 07:19.604
use it to boost their abilities.

07:19.605 --> 07:23.604
All three kids were on Sway,
trying to make a splash.

07:23.605 --> 07:26.357
Chromachron used his telekinesis

07:26.482 --> 07:28.604
to try to stop a robber's bullet.

07:28.605 --> 07:32.604
As you can see, he eventually succeeded.

07:32.605 --> 07:36.398
As to what happened to these
two, I'm still working that out.

07:36.524 --> 07:39.604
But I'd hazard a guess that
it was not what they intended.

07:39.605 --> 07:42.604
Now, are there any stupid questions?

07:42.605 --> 07:43.604
Okay. So, you showed me some things.

07:43.605 --> 07:46.898
I wanna bust Royalle as much
as you. But Wolfe is evil.

07:47.023 --> 07:50.023
- Do you believe in evil?
- Yes, I do.

07:51.605 --> 07:54.190
And evil lies. Always.

07:54.315 --> 07:57.605
Cops do cop shit. Let's do some cop shit.

08:00.605 --> 08:03.604
You asked for Powers Division, correct?

08:03.605 --> 08:06.605
You asked to work with me, why?

08:08.605 --> 08:13.604
Because only you can teach
me how a Power thinks.

08:13.605 --> 08:16.605
I need to talk to Wolfe.

08:21.605 --> 08:23.604
Okay.

08:23.605 --> 08:25.315
You're not talking to Wolfe.

08:25.482 --> 08:26.604
Royalle is gonna get...

08:26.605 --> 08:29.605
I don't want anyone talking to Wolfe!

08:30.605 --> 08:35.357
I especially don't want
Royalle talking to Wolfe.

08:35.524 --> 08:38.604
Sooner or later, Royalle's
lawyers are gonna get him in there.

08:38.605 --> 08:40.815
So, do something to fuck him up.

08:42.605 --> 08:44.604
What?

08:44.605 --> 08:47.605
Do something to keep him at bay.

08:50.606 --> 08:54.565
We're supposed to be talking
about the launch of my foundation.

08:54.605 --> 08:57.604
Whose mission is to transform
young girls into leaders.

08:57.605 --> 09:01.604
Why not bring Zora on as the
foundation's first mentor?

09:01.605 --> 09:03.604
Zora would love that.

09:03.605 --> 09:06.604
We put the two of you out
there, looking like a team,

09:06.605 --> 09:09.604
talking about sharing your
experiences with the next generation.

09:09.605 --> 09:12.604
No interviews. Just press
release and a photo op.

09:12.605 --> 09:13.604
We could do like a riff on

09:13.605 --> 09:15.689
the Supershock-Righteous
Thunder team-up photos?

09:15.856 --> 09:18.604
You know, the two of you in
your super suits on top of the...

09:18.605 --> 09:21.605
I'm not wearing that ridiculous suit.

09:22.605 --> 09:24.023
I'm not starving myself
for a week beforehand

09:24.148 --> 09:27.604
and dousing myself in baby
powder to get the damn thing on.

09:27.605 --> 09:30.604
And for what, to stand next to a
dewy 20-year-old for a photo op?

09:30.605 --> 09:31.605
Are you guys kidding me?

09:33.605 --> 09:37.604
There are entire websites
dedicated to analyzing

09:37.605 --> 09:39.940
and dissecting every single
photograph and video of me.

09:40.065 --> 09:41.604
- Are you aware of that?
- Um... No.

09:41.605 --> 09:46.107
My face and my body are
chopped up into separate pieces

09:46.232 --> 09:48.605
and they are judged down
to the last minute detail.

09:50.107 --> 09:53.148
Every line, every wrinkle, every blemish.

09:53.273 --> 09:57.604
If I'm tired, I've lost my edge.

09:57.605 --> 10:01.148
And if I look good, I've
clearly had some work done.

10:03.605 --> 10:05.604
Can you imagine what that's like?

10:05.605 --> 10:08.605
That would be really shitty.

10:08.648 --> 10:13.604
I'm not wearing the suit. I hate that suit.

10:13.605 --> 10:16.604
Protesters continue to
gather outside the courthouse,

10:16.605 --> 10:18.605
- _
- awaiting Judge Tanaka's decision.

10:18.689 --> 10:22.604
With groups ranging from
well-known Civil Rights advocates,

10:22.605 --> 10:24.604
to the new youth anti-Powers movement

10:24.605 --> 10:26.604
known as Kaotic Chic.

10:26.605 --> 10:29.605
Whose videos have been spreading
like wildfire across social...

10:36.605 --> 10:37.773
You gonna answer him?

10:40.190 --> 10:43.605
He obviously cares about
you. You should answer him.

10:48.107 --> 10:49.604
I'm gonna run my errands.

10:49.605 --> 10:51.232
You can give the boy a call.

10:51.357 --> 10:54.604
I don't wanna call him. He's a liar.

10:54.605 --> 10:56.856
And he has a problem with Powers.

10:57.981 --> 11:00.604
Is that why you didn't take the Sway?

11:00.605 --> 11:03.273
I just haven't decided yet.

11:06.898 --> 11:10.190
Power is absolute, Calista.

11:10.315 --> 11:11.605
You either have it, or you don't.

11:15.605 --> 11:17.190
I shouldn't have given it to you.

11:17.357 --> 11:19.604
I'm not giving it back.

11:19.605 --> 11:22.604
It's my choice, Simons. Mine!

11:22.605 --> 11:24.605
And I'll make it when I'm fucking ready.

11:28.605 --> 11:30.605
If you're not a Power, you should be.

11:37.605 --> 11:38.898
Queen bee arrives.

11:40.605 --> 11:43.604
We may have to wait to collect the Sway.

11:43.605 --> 11:45.482
To get you to the right agent,

11:45.605 --> 11:47.604
please select from the following options.

11:47.605 --> 11:49.605
To transfer to billing responsibility...

11:51.605 --> 11:53.605
Krisp! Krispin!

11:54.605 --> 11:56.605
Shit.

12:07.605 --> 12:08.606
Hey, Craig.

12:08.731 --> 12:10.604
You have Zora prepped for Under Armour?

12:10.605 --> 12:12.604
We've been playing phone tag,

12:12.605 --> 12:14.604
but I will make sure that she's
up to speed before the meeting.

12:14.605 --> 12:15.605
Phone tag?

12:16.606 --> 12:19.773
That is not the tactic
you use to land Zora.

12:19.898 --> 12:21.618
I'm trying to clear up
a few things at home.

12:21.648 --> 12:24.605
It's been a little extra tough right now.

12:24.648 --> 12:27.604
Candace, with all due
respect to your recent loss,

12:27.605 --> 12:29.604
Zora needs a manager

12:29.605 --> 12:32.689
who is willing to make her
the number one priority.

12:32.815 --> 12:36.604
I don't know, maybe this isn't a good fit.

12:36.605 --> 12:39.604
I'm on it. Okay. I'll see you there.

12:39.605 --> 12:40.605
Thanks.

12:45.605 --> 12:49.604
My wish for the world... and
this will sound insane, I know.

12:49.605 --> 12:53.604
But my wish is that the
Moon could be a Drainer.

12:53.605 --> 12:56.482
A vast orb of green light...

12:56.605 --> 12:58.604
Can you turn that thing off, please?

12:58.605 --> 13:01.604
- I can't concentrate.
- Fuck off.

13:01.605 --> 13:03.604
You are such a dick.

13:03.605 --> 13:05.605
Fucking lawyers.

13:10.605 --> 13:13.398
- Turn that thing off.
- That's what I told him.

13:13.565 --> 13:15.604
And I told you to fuck off.

13:15.605 --> 13:18.605
Can you stop fighting for once?

13:19.605 --> 13:21.604
Why the fuck can't you
get along with yourself?

13:21.605 --> 13:23.604
- He started it.
- No, he started it.

13:23.605 --> 13:25.605
Yeah, well, I'm finishing it.

13:26.648 --> 13:29.190
The lawyers figure out how to get you in?

13:29.357 --> 13:32.605
We need proof that the
Drainer is physically harmful.

13:34.815 --> 13:37.604
Are you gonna tell us what's going on?

13:37.605 --> 13:39.605
What are you afraid of?

13:40.689 --> 13:43.605
Walker pulled his power from Wolfe.

13:45.565 --> 13:47.604
What if it's the Sway?

13:47.605 --> 13:49.604
What if it filled that hole inside of him?

13:49.605 --> 13:52.023
What if it filled that
selfish son of a bitch

13:52.148 --> 13:54.604
with Wolfe's ability to draw powers?

13:54.605 --> 13:56.605
What if I've created another monster?

13:58.605 --> 14:01.604
You're supposed to collect
the Sway that's out there.

14:01.605 --> 14:03.605
I'm doing it right now.

14:05.605 --> 14:06.604
Where's the girl?

14:06.605 --> 14:08.815
"Where's the girl, where's the girl?"

14:08.940 --> 14:10.605
What?

14:12.605 --> 14:13.605
Nothing.

14:16.605 --> 14:19.604
The girl's helping me collect the Sway.

14:19.605 --> 14:22.731
You can't stand her. You're
always saying, "Get rid of her."

14:22.856 --> 14:24.604
Just because I think she's a liability,

14:24.605 --> 14:26.604
it doesn't mean I can't like her.

14:26.605 --> 14:28.605
What the fuck does that even mean?

14:29.605 --> 14:31.648
I like her. She's sweet.

14:33.898 --> 14:35.604
Cops. Walker and Pilgrim.

14:35.605 --> 14:37.357
Where?

14:38.605 --> 14:42.605
Johnny Royalle, come out to play.

14:43.357 --> 14:44.605
Deal with them.

14:45.605 --> 14:47.604
What if he tries to absorb my powers?

14:47.605 --> 14:48.689
He's not gonna do that.

14:48.856 --> 14:51.273
- You just said that he might...
- He's not.

14:51.398 --> 14:55.605
He's got a search warrant. He's
here to find Sway. Let them in.

14:59.605 --> 15:01.604
So, where is he?

15:01.605 --> 15:05.604
Well, he's not crouching
behind the bar. Take a look.

15:05.605 --> 15:07.605
Don't fuck with me, freak show.

15:07.648 --> 15:10.605
- Don't touch me.
- Just tell us where he is.

15:11.605 --> 15:14.605
He's in Kuala Lumpur. I think.

15:15.605 --> 15:16.815
What's in back?

15:17.605 --> 15:18.981
An office.

15:19.107 --> 15:20.604
Any more of you creeping around?

15:20.605 --> 15:22.604
No. There's only one of me.

15:22.605 --> 15:23.604
Oh.

15:23.655 --> 15:26.323
- You all in there now?
- I said, don't touch me!

15:26.448 --> 15:27.654
Why not, man?

15:27.655 --> 15:28.654
You can't have my power!

15:28.655 --> 15:29.654
Hey!

15:29.655 --> 15:31.654
Hey, I'm just... Hey, come here, man!

15:31.655 --> 15:33.655
I'm not kidding. Come here!

15:34.198 --> 15:35.240
Shit!

15:51.655 --> 15:52.655
This way!

15:54.655 --> 15:55.655
Hey!

15:57.655 --> 15:58.655
I got him!

15:59.655 --> 16:00.654
Hey!

16:00.655 --> 16:01.655
Shit!

16:10.655 --> 16:11.655
Yeah?

16:14.365 --> 16:17.654
Okay, pull yourself together!

16:17.655 --> 16:20.654
I can't! I can't!

16:20.655 --> 16:22.654
Only I can pull us back together.

16:22.655 --> 16:24.407
What?

16:27.655 --> 16:30.031
Fuck! Shit!

16:32.655 --> 16:33.655
Shit!

16:35.655 --> 16:37.654
- You okay?
- Yeah.

16:37.655 --> 16:39.948
- You?
- Yeah.

16:48.655 --> 16:50.654
Hey! Get the fuck out!

16:50.655 --> 16:51.865
Get the fuck out!

16:51.990 --> 16:54.115
- Come here! Come here!
- Whoa!

16:55.574 --> 16:57.654
Okay, listen up!

16:57.655 --> 17:01.574
My partner and I, having been assaulted,

17:01.655 --> 17:04.655
have legal grounds to
use deadly fucking force!

17:06.214 --> 17:07.654
We do. We do.

17:07.655 --> 17:10.654
Now, come out, and get yourself together

17:10.655 --> 17:12.655
before I fucking kill you!

17:14.655 --> 17:15.855
I'm going to fucking kill him.

17:21.655 --> 17:24.655
Here we go. Well, here we go.

17:34.655 --> 17:36.031
Shit!

17:43.655 --> 17:45.654
Here we go.

17:45.655 --> 17:46.655
Here we go. Come on.

17:48.655 --> 17:49.655
Hey, get in there.

17:50.655 --> 17:54.655
You are under motherfucking arrest. Yeah.

18:00.655 --> 18:03.655
Let's go, hon, we're gonna be late.

18:14.655 --> 18:15.655
What the hell?

18:20.655 --> 18:21.655
I'll be right back.

18:39.655 --> 18:42.739
I wanna tell them I'm
sorry, about their friends.

18:42.906 --> 18:46.654
That's nice. They'll appreciate that.

18:46.655 --> 18:47.655
I'm going this way.

18:48.655 --> 18:50.654
No, no! No, no, no.

18:50.655 --> 18:52.654
- Get away from there.
- Keys! Keys! Where are they?

18:52.655 --> 18:54.073
Thank you.

18:57.240 --> 18:58.655
No, please. Wait!

19:04.655 --> 19:05.655
No!

19:16.655 --> 19:18.574
Simons?

19:35.655 --> 19:37.655
Not so tough now, huh?

19:43.574 --> 19:46.655
Get over it. It ain't
like it's killing you.

19:55.906 --> 19:59.654
We have a strong commitment
to women's stories of power.

19:59.655 --> 20:03.240
And your story, the relentless training,

20:03.365 --> 20:05.073
your amazing performance at the Shaft,

20:05.240 --> 20:07.655
is a perfect reflection of our brand.

20:07.698 --> 20:10.654
And of what we strive to
help all women achieve,

20:10.655 --> 20:13.532
whether they have powers or not.

20:13.655 --> 20:15.654
Now, commitment is the cornerstone.

20:15.655 --> 20:17.990
But these renderings
are just a starting point

20:18.157 --> 20:20.654
for our imagination and for yours.

20:20.655 --> 20:24.654
They are absolutely thrilled by
the idea of designing a new suit.

20:24.655 --> 20:25.655
Okay.

20:29.655 --> 20:32.073
We love your designs,
and we want you to play...

20:32.198 --> 20:33.654
What a coincidence,

20:33.655 --> 20:36.654
that we both just happen
to be here at the same time.

20:36.655 --> 20:38.654
... your dedication, and will inspire

20:38.655 --> 20:40.655
every single woman who wears it.

20:41.655 --> 20:43.654
Janice!

20:43.655 --> 20:45.695
We're so excited to talk
to you about the new design.

20:46.655 --> 20:49.157
Of course, you already know Zora.

20:49.282 --> 20:52.654
We're hoping to convince her
to join our Under Armour family.

20:52.655 --> 20:54.654
I think she'll make
another great role model.

20:54.655 --> 20:56.655
I couldn't agree more.

20:59.031 --> 21:03.654
Uh, if you don't mind, could Zora
and I just have a moment alone?

21:03.655 --> 21:06.654
Of course. We're all set up
for you in the design studio

21:06.655 --> 21:08.655
- whenever you're ready.
- Thank you.

21:18.655 --> 21:21.654
In case you haven't figured it out,

21:21.655 --> 21:25.655
Craig has paired you up with me
to see if you can get a draft.

21:26.282 --> 21:27.654
Uh...

21:27.655 --> 21:31.655
I don't... I mean, I didn't ask him to.

21:32.198 --> 21:34.615
That's why you have an agent.

21:36.655 --> 21:42.654
Zora, you know, in time
and with rigorous training,

21:42.655 --> 21:44.655
you can gain control of your powers.

21:46.365 --> 21:49.655
But all of this, the
celebrity and the fame,

21:52.655 --> 21:54.654
you can't master it.

21:54.655 --> 21:57.654
But what fame can do

21:57.655 --> 22:01.655
is it creates amazing opportunities
to do something lasting.

22:07.655 --> 22:11.654
I never asked to take the credit for Wolfe.

22:11.655 --> 22:12.654
That was the media.

22:12.655 --> 22:14.654
They grabbed onto this
story and ran with it.

22:14.655 --> 22:18.655
It just got way too big, too fast.

22:20.655 --> 22:23.407
I know. I understand.

22:26.532 --> 22:29.655
But you haven't done much to
correct the situation, have you?

22:31.655 --> 22:33.654
What am I supposed to do?

22:33.655 --> 22:35.654
I'm doing everything that Craig

22:35.655 --> 22:37.654
and Tommy and Candace are telling me to do.

22:37.655 --> 22:41.655
Where to go, what to say, who
my friends are! I can't even...

22:43.655 --> 22:47.654
I knocked down Wolfe. I did that.

22:47.655 --> 22:52.654
I never said you didn't. But
did you toss him into that cell?

22:52.655 --> 22:55.655
Do you remember doing that?
Because I certainly didn't do it.

23:01.655 --> 23:02.655
Diamond?

23:04.655 --> 23:05.654
We both know it didn't happen

23:05.655 --> 23:07.655
the way that everybody's
saying it happened.

23:08.655 --> 23:10.157
And that's the business.

23:12.655 --> 23:15.615
And, Zora, this is your
moment of opportunity.

23:17.655 --> 23:19.655
Please use it to do something real.

23:25.655 --> 23:28.654
Oh, God. Look at this.

23:28.655 --> 23:33.532
Every time I say, "No
onions," they're huge.

23:34.655 --> 23:36.655
Is it hurting him?

23:37.655 --> 23:38.865
I won't lie.

23:39.031 --> 23:41.654
- I kind of hope it's hurting him.
- Guys?

23:41.655 --> 23:43.655
Buddy of mine on Metro
patrol just sent me this.

23:45.655 --> 23:48.323
Oh, shit.

23:48.448 --> 23:50.655
Guess we know why he was crying so much.

23:52.655 --> 23:54.654
Hey, you said you'd listen.

23:54.655 --> 23:58.654
I've had one of the worst
days of my life, so just go.

23:58.655 --> 24:01.532
I just spent 30 bucks in cab fare, okay?

24:01.655 --> 24:03.240
Can I have five minutes?

24:03.407 --> 24:04.654
Look, she's just a friend.

24:04.655 --> 24:06.282
I don't care if she's just a friend!

24:06.407 --> 24:07.654
You betrayed me!

24:07.655 --> 24:11.654
Her cousin was killed by a
Power, just like my dad was.

24:11.655 --> 24:13.654
I had tagged Here and Gone for her.

24:13.655 --> 24:15.654
But we tagged the police
station together for my dad.

24:15.655 --> 24:17.654
And I swear I could only share that

24:17.655 --> 24:18.935
with someone I really care about.

24:20.615 --> 24:22.655
I really, really care about you.

24:24.655 --> 24:26.073
I'm sorry.

24:27.655 --> 24:29.655
What's her name?

24:30.655 --> 24:31.654
I don't know.

24:31.655 --> 24:32.655
I only know her handle.

24:33.655 --> 24:35.240
It's Kaotic Chic.

24:37.407 --> 24:38.654
Oh, shit.

24:38.655 --> 24:39.654
You fucking asshole!

24:39.655 --> 24:41.654
You had me helping you tag a police station

24:41.655 --> 24:43.654
with another girl's name?

24:43.655 --> 24:44.654
What? No, no.

24:44.655 --> 24:47.654
That Kaotic Chic is different,
okay. That's a message.

24:47.655 --> 24:50.323
It's a message you made
out of another girl's name!

24:50.448 --> 24:52.906
It's branding, okay?

24:53.031 --> 24:55.654
You've got to create the associations.

24:55.655 --> 24:57.654
You know, the connections
between the words "Kaotic Chic"

24:57.655 --> 24:58.948
and the fucked up shit Powers do.

24:59.073 --> 25:00.654
Just stop.

25:00.655 --> 25:02.655
- What?
- Stop talking.

25:05.655 --> 25:07.655
I'm a Power.

25:09.332 --> 25:12.655
Shit. What do you do?

25:13.655 --> 25:15.655
My powers haven't manifested yet.

25:19.574 --> 25:21.157
So, you don't really have powers.

25:21.282 --> 25:23.655
I just told you. I do.

25:29.655 --> 25:35.073
I really, really hope, for your
sake, that you're wrong, okay.

25:35.198 --> 25:38.948
Because I think this world would
be better off without Powers.

25:40.655 --> 25:41.654
Get out.

25:41.655 --> 25:43.654
- Calista, please...
- Get out.

25:43.655 --> 25:46.654
- You just...
- I said get out. Just leave!

25:46.655 --> 25:48.654
You are so sucked into their bullshit.

25:48.655 --> 25:50.654
And you don't even see it!

25:50.655 --> 25:52.654
It's like you think you've gotta be a Power

25:52.655 --> 25:54.157
to even matter in this world.

25:54.282 --> 25:56.574
You don't know anything!
You don't anything about me!

25:56.655 --> 25:58.654
You don't know anything
about my life or whatever...

25:58.655 --> 25:59.654
Simons?

25:59.655 --> 26:01.654
I said get out! Just leave!

26:01.655 --> 26:02.655
Fuck you.

26:04.655 --> 26:05.654
My dad was killed by a Power!

26:05.655 --> 26:07.655
Krisp, that's not what I...

26:11.655 --> 26:13.532
Is everything all right here?

26:16.655 --> 26:19.654
No. It doesn't look like it is.

26:19.655 --> 26:21.655
Krispin, is it?

26:24.655 --> 26:28.655
I think it would best if you leave now.

26:31.655 --> 26:32.655
You see, Calista?

26:34.655 --> 26:36.655
They think they know what's best for us.

26:46.365 --> 26:47.655
This is bullshit.

27:03.655 --> 27:05.654
Are you okay? Did he hurt you?

27:05.655 --> 27:06.655
No.

27:08.198 --> 27:10.198
Where's Simons? God damn it.

27:10.323 --> 27:12.655
He's supposed to be keeping an eye on you.

27:14.655 --> 27:15.823
He's dead.

27:18.823 --> 27:20.698
What do you mean, he's dead?

27:21.698 --> 27:23.115
He died,

27:24.655 --> 27:26.655
right in front of me.

27:27.655 --> 27:28.655
What, here?

27:30.655 --> 27:34.655
At The Strip. He just dropped.

27:37.655 --> 27:39.654
Where's the Sway?

27:39.655 --> 27:41.655
I didn't... I just ran.

27:44.655 --> 27:46.948
You did the right thing.

27:48.655 --> 27:50.655
The cops are still looking for you.

27:52.655 --> 27:55.654
I'll get down to Powers Division.

27:55.655 --> 27:58.654
I'm sorry. I don't wanna
leave you alone again

27:58.655 --> 28:00.654
but I can't take you there.

28:00.655 --> 28:02.655
I'll be all right.

28:04.655 --> 28:08.157
You'll come back. You always come back.

28:08.906 --> 28:10.655
Go take care of your friend, Johnny.

28:27.655 --> 28:30.654
That is just weird.

28:30.655 --> 28:31.654
Is it a person?

28:31.655 --> 28:35.532
I haven't cut into it yet,
but judging by its exterior,

28:35.655 --> 28:38.655
I surmise that it is
filled with blood and guts.

28:39.031 --> 28:40.654
So, he was he dealing?

28:40.655 --> 28:42.654
Metro talked to some of the Kidz.

28:42.655 --> 28:44.654
They said he was taking
Sway away from them.

28:44.655 --> 28:46.323
What?

28:46.655 --> 28:48.654
There was a girl with him, too.

28:48.655 --> 28:50.654
- Calista?
- Description matches.

28:50.655 --> 28:52.781
I am so hot to bust that brat.

28:52.948 --> 28:55.655
You got Royalle's errand boy
off the street. Get her, too.

28:55.656 --> 28:58.655
Connect him to Olympia once and for all.

28:59.365 --> 29:00.655
Fuck him up?

29:01.655 --> 29:02.655
Indeed.

29:03.655 --> 29:05.655
Asshole alert on aisle 12.

29:06.655 --> 29:08.655
I can't hear myself, Johnny.

29:08.698 --> 29:11.058
I don't know what this is doing.
I feel like it's killing me.

29:11.655 --> 29:13.448
I'll get you out.

29:13.574 --> 29:14.654
Johnny, no.

29:14.655 --> 29:17.654
Listen. The Drainer killed one of him.

29:17.655 --> 29:20.906
That machine is dangerous,
and we have proof now.

29:21.031 --> 29:23.654
He's my friend.

29:23.655 --> 29:27.655
If you wanna see Wolfe,
this is our legal edge.

29:29.490 --> 29:32.655
Get me out. I feel so alone.

29:33.655 --> 29:35.654
I'll get you out, but not now.

29:35.655 --> 29:38.655
I need you to stay in there. I'm sorry.

29:39.865 --> 29:41.655
- What the fuck?
- Restraining order.

29:44.655 --> 29:49.654
Commander Cross, here we are again,

29:49.655 --> 29:53.655
addressing the illegalities
perpetuated by your division.

29:55.198 --> 29:58.654
This inhuman device,

29:58.655 --> 30:02.654
and the murderous consequences
of its ill-conceived use,

30:02.655 --> 30:05.698
are Exhibit A in my renewed application

30:05.823 --> 30:08.654
for a humanitarian visit
to the prisoner Wolfe.

30:08.655 --> 30:11.654
Humanitarian? You're so full of shit, man!

30:11.655 --> 30:13.655
What are you doing with Wolfe?

30:15.655 --> 30:18.654
Stay away from him, Johnny.
You can't change the past.

30:18.655 --> 30:21.739
You keep trying, and you keep fucking up.

30:22.655 --> 30:24.906
Food for thought.

30:25.031 --> 30:30.198
But my legal counsel Ms. Legarde
and I have a judge to see.

30:31.655 --> 30:33.198
Fuck!

30:51.655 --> 30:53.157
- Hey, Krispin.
- You were right.

30:54.031 --> 30:56.031
This is our movement.

30:56.157 --> 30:58.654
We should do whatever
we can to help it grow.

30:58.655 --> 31:00.654
And you should be here.

31:00.655 --> 31:03.655
I'm really glad you said that.
Because, actually, I'm here already.

31:04.655 --> 31:08.654
Cool. That's cool. So, we can...

31:08.655 --> 31:12.655
We can really make Kaotic Chic
into something special, Krispin.

31:35.655 --> 31:38.655
Johnny, why don't you come on in?

31:40.655 --> 31:42.655
It doesn't hurt.

31:47.655 --> 31:50.407
We don't have much time.

31:50.532 --> 31:51.654
No, we never seem to have much time

31:51.655 --> 31:54.654
when you come visiting.

31:54.655 --> 31:59.655
All the many, many times you came visiting.

32:02.157 --> 32:07.654
It's taken me a while, but I
finally put Humpty together again.

32:07.655 --> 32:13.655
What was that thing you
kept sticking in my eye?

32:17.655 --> 32:20.655
Wolfe, sir.

32:24.655 --> 32:26.655
I made something,

32:28.115 --> 32:29.655
a drug.

32:31.655 --> 32:34.448
A panacea for the weak.

32:36.655 --> 32:37.655
Sway.

32:41.198 --> 32:44.655
And Walker, he used it. And it...

32:46.655 --> 32:48.654
It let him take...

32:48.655 --> 32:51.490
It let him take power from me. Yes.

32:53.655 --> 32:55.655
What have you done?

33:00.655 --> 33:04.157
He thinks he took his own power out of you.

33:06.655 --> 33:08.654
He doesn't know

33:08.655 --> 33:12.655
he can absorb power, life,

33:12.781 --> 33:15.655
from anybody who has used Sway.

33:16.655 --> 33:17.906
How many?

33:20.655 --> 33:22.655
Too many.

33:28.655 --> 33:31.655
What a marvelous invention.

33:33.115 --> 33:35.654
That half-dead robot
has more understanding

33:35.655 --> 33:38.157
of how our powers work than we do.

33:39.739 --> 33:43.655
He is really rather clever.

33:44.906 --> 33:46.655
But imperfect.

33:48.655 --> 33:50.654
It falters sometimes,

33:50.655 --> 33:53.781
and when it does, I feel my power.

33:54.655 --> 33:55.655
And...

33:57.655 --> 33:58.655
And...

33:59.655 --> 34:02.655
And something else.

34:03.655 --> 34:06.655
Something new.

34:08.655 --> 34:13.654
I feel, just beyond my reach,

34:13.655 --> 34:18.655
I feel a vast reservoir of power.

34:19.655 --> 34:23.655
A flood, waiting for me.

34:25.656 --> 34:27.197
Sway.

34:28.655 --> 34:31.654
What a wonderful name.

34:31.655 --> 34:37.114
And he shall have sway and
dominion over all the world.

34:41.655 --> 34:44.655
You made a drug out of me, didn't you?

34:47.574 --> 34:53.654
You put me into a gaggle of
burgeoning powerful youths.

34:53.655 --> 34:58.615
And you think Christian is the
one you have to worry about?

34:58.655 --> 35:01.654
You did not turn Christian into me.

35:01.655 --> 35:02.655
I am alone.

35:03.655 --> 35:05.654
I am hunger.

35:05.655 --> 35:10.654
I am the will to be free.

35:10.655 --> 35:12.654
I am a void that must be filled.

35:12.655 --> 35:18.654
And you, you've given me
a chance to fill that void

35:18.655 --> 35:22.654
by not opening my mouth
or ruining my clothes.

35:22.655 --> 35:26.654
You stupid fucking idiot.

35:26.655 --> 35:28.655
They're gonna drain you.

35:29.655 --> 35:31.073
They're gonna drain me?

35:32.655 --> 35:35.654
How many children took that Sway?

35:35.655 --> 35:40.654
How many of them ate of my blood and body?

35:40.655 --> 35:43.655
How many of them will I suck dry?

35:44.655 --> 35:47.654
They're gonna drain you forever.

35:47.655 --> 35:50.654
Did you not smell the reek of stale whiskey

35:50.655 --> 35:51.654
on Triphammer's breath?

35:51.655 --> 35:54.031
How long until he breaks,

35:54.157 --> 35:58.031
till the machine falters and fails?

35:59.031 --> 36:01.654
How long before I can plunge my face

36:01.655 --> 36:03.655
into the cool waters

36:04.655 --> 36:07.655
and drink my fill?

36:13.655 --> 36:15.655
Let me out!

36:17.655 --> 36:18.655
Let me out!

36:40.655 --> 36:43.490
Royalle's lawyer has the ear of someone

36:43.655 --> 36:46.654
on the Federal Powers Detention Board.

36:46.655 --> 36:50.655
One of the Simons dying was the
wedge she needed to open the door.

36:53.407 --> 36:54.655
Okay.

36:55.655 --> 36:58.654
Talk to Harley. Let me go in there.

36:58.655 --> 37:01.448
We have to know what he wants from Wolfe,

37:01.574 --> 37:03.157
why he didn't break him out,

37:03.323 --> 37:05.655
why he's been teleporting
in there for months.

37:08.655 --> 37:11.323
Emile, you have to let me try.

37:15.655 --> 37:16.655
Okay.

38:41.655 --> 38:42.655
I'm sorry for your loss.

38:45.655 --> 38:46.906
What did you mean when you told Walker

38:47.031 --> 38:49.655
he couldn't have your powers?

38:50.655 --> 38:51.655
Pilgrim?

38:51.656 --> 38:53.654
What?

38:53.655 --> 38:55.654
Files you wanted were released
from Cook County family court.

38:55.655 --> 38:56.654
Should have 'em in your inbox.

38:56.655 --> 38:57.654
Uh, thank you.

38:57.655 --> 38:59.654
Yeah.

38:59.655 --> 39:01.654
The Metro cops that found the dead Simons,

39:01.655 --> 39:02.654
did they inventory his Sway?

39:02.655 --> 39:04.655
- I can find out.
- Thank you.

39:04.698 --> 39:07.654
Let me know if their count matched ours.

39:07.655 --> 39:08.655
You got it.

39:13.655 --> 39:15.655
Today, I am rich in friends.

39:17.906 --> 39:19.655
I'm not your friend.

39:20.655 --> 39:22.655
No. You are so much more than that.

39:24.655 --> 39:26.656
Royalle's not your friend either.

39:27.655 --> 39:30.655
But he's done so much for me.

39:32.823 --> 39:34.654
If he was your friend,

39:34.655 --> 39:36.655
he would have gotten you out.

39:38.655 --> 39:42.865
Johnny is concerned more with
the noumenal elements of myself

39:42.990 --> 39:44.739
rather than my freedom.

39:46.655 --> 39:48.655
I don't know what that means.

39:50.574 --> 39:55.655
Johnny is worried about my soul, I think.

39:57.073 --> 40:01.655
He wants to purify me of my
sins. Some bullshit like that.

40:03.655 --> 40:04.655
What do you want?

40:10.823 --> 40:15.654
Yes. We both know what you want.

40:15.655 --> 40:19.739
For myself, I want to be out of here.

40:21.655 --> 40:26.655
I want my 20 years of
torture to be at an end.

40:30.655 --> 40:33.654
Drained or not, they'll never let you go.

40:33.655 --> 40:36.823
Don't be an asshole. I
don't want to be drained.

40:36.948 --> 40:38.654
Then, why did you ask?

40:38.655 --> 40:40.240
Come on, Christian,

40:40.365 --> 40:42.655
you don't want me to be
drained any more than I do.

40:43.823 --> 40:46.654
That's why you came here, isn't it?

40:46.655 --> 40:49.655
So I could tell you
what happened between us?

40:50.655 --> 40:53.157
There's no question.

40:53.282 --> 40:55.655
You took back your powers from me.

40:58.655 --> 41:00.655
Didn't it feel good?

41:01.655 --> 41:03.490
It did for me.

41:05.073 --> 41:07.654
Don't you wanna feel like that again?

41:07.655 --> 41:08.654
I do.

41:08.655 --> 41:09.654
You can.

41:09.655 --> 41:11.655
- I do.
- You can have them all.

41:12.655 --> 41:17.407
All you have to do is
to switch out the light.

41:23.655 --> 41:25.654
Before they use it

41:25.655 --> 41:30.574
to take your powers out of me forever.

41:43.655 --> 41:45.490
Can I come in?

41:49.655 --> 41:50.655
Calista?

41:51.532 --> 41:52.655
Johnny?

41:56.655 --> 41:58.655
I'm right here.

42:01.655 --> 42:02.655
Am I still alive?

42:04.655 --> 42:05.655
Yes.

42:07.615 --> 42:08.655
You're still alive.

42:11.655 --> 42:13.655
I was so afraid that...

42:15.655 --> 42:18.365
That I didn't belong...

42:18.490 --> 42:20.115
That I wasn't a Power.

42:21.655 --> 42:24.654
But I am.

42:24.655 --> 42:27.655
I must be. Right?

42:35.655 --> 42:37.654
Judge Tanaka has agreed to Wolfe's request

42:37.655 --> 42:39.654
to be permanently drained,

42:39.655 --> 42:41.654
and the Federal Powers Detention Board

42:41.655 --> 42:45.654
has scheduled the draining to
take place in just one week.

42:45.655 --> 42:46.655
Thank you, Delia.

42:46.656 --> 42:48.654
Oh, fuck.

42:48.655 --> 42:50.073
Needless to say, emotions
are running very high today.

42:50.240 --> 42:52.680
But I think we can all agree the
world will be a safer place...

43:00.698 --> 43:03.407
- Hey.
- Hi.

43:03.655 --> 43:04.990
You okay?

43:05.157 --> 43:07.655
I have no idea how I am.

43:11.655 --> 43:13.654
What are you doing?

43:13.655 --> 43:15.654
Eating ice cream.

43:15.655 --> 43:18.655
- Butter pecan?
- Yes.

43:20.490 --> 43:24.654
Remember that stand we
used to go to in the park?

43:24.655 --> 43:27.654
That is exactly where I am.

43:27.655 --> 43:30.655
Really? Are you getting away with it?

43:30.990 --> 43:32.654
Mmm-hmm.

43:32.655 --> 43:33.865
So far.

43:34.655 --> 43:36.654
How's it feel?

43:36.655 --> 43:38.654
I like it.

43:38.655 --> 43:40.157
Maybe a little too much.

43:41.655 --> 43:44.031
I could just walk away
from all of it, you know?

43:44.157 --> 43:45.654
Ah...

43:45.655 --> 43:47.654
You wouldn't last a week.

43:47.655 --> 43:49.654
Do not underestimate me.

43:49.655 --> 43:51.073
I'm not.

43:51.198 --> 43:54.654
Something would happen.
Car accident, fire...

43:54.655 --> 43:59.655
And you would just be you in
all your inescapable glory.

44:00.655 --> 44:03.654
As long as you still had your powers,

44:03.655 --> 44:06.654
you wouldn't be able to
stop yourself, trust me.

44:06.655 --> 44:08.654
What about your powers?

44:08.655 --> 44:10.654
I went to see Wolfe.

44:10.655 --> 44:14.282
Okay. What was that like?

44:14.448 --> 44:16.739
He fucked with my head. Like he always did.

44:18.655 --> 44:21.655
Thinks he knows what I
want better than I do.

44:21.781 --> 44:23.655
What do you want, Christian?

44:26.655 --> 44:29.198
I wanna be great, Janice.

44:30.655 --> 44:33.654
You know, I really think I could be great.

44:33.655 --> 44:35.698
If I had another chance. I just...

44:37.655 --> 44:39.865
I don't know how to get 'em back.

44:39.990 --> 44:42.654
I used to think that in every situation,

44:42.655 --> 44:43.655
there was a good choice or a bad choice.

44:43.739 --> 44:46.654
But sometimes, Christian,

44:46.655 --> 44:50.448
there's just a shitty choice
and an unacceptable choice.

44:50.574 --> 44:52.655
And only you know which one is which.

44:54.655 --> 44:57.655
Oh, God. I just got
spotted. I'll call you later.

45:22.282 --> 45:23.655
It's gonna be okay.

45:25.655 --> 45:27.655
He's not gonna hurt you.

45:29.655 --> 45:31.490
Not gonna hurt anyone.

45:32.655 --> 45:34.654
I'll figure it out.

45:34.655 --> 45:36.655
Oh, Jesus. Johnny, what did you do to her?

45:38.655 --> 45:40.115
She's okay.

45:40.240 --> 45:42.654
She took Sway, Christian. But she's okay.

45:42.655 --> 45:44.655
What the fuck, man?

45:45.655 --> 45:47.654
Hey! Is she gonna die?

45:47.655 --> 45:48.655
No, she's not.

45:49.655 --> 45:52.654
Hey, Calista. Look at me, it's Diamond.

45:52.655 --> 45:54.655
What the fuck have you done, man?

45:56.655 --> 45:58.654
Don't you disappear on me. You hear me?

45:58.655 --> 46:01.655
Don't you fucking run away from this again!

46:01.781 --> 46:05.655
Christian, I wouldn't dream of it.

46:13.655 --> 46:15.655
Help! Somebody help me!

46:19.407 --> 46:20.654
Please. Please, don't do this!

46:20.655 --> 46:22.654
You heard the lady, asshole!

46:22.655 --> 46:23.655
Fuck you.

46:27.655 --> 46:29.282
No. Fuck you...

46:31.855 --> 46:34.031
Please. Please, don't do this!
