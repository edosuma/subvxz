Songbird speaks truth.

00:34.992 --> 00:38.703
My cell prevents me from
calling mine hammer, Mjolnir.

00:38.783 --> 00:40.500
But I know it is out there.

00:40.593 --> 00:43.846
Falcon, I'm starting to think
the Avengers are cursed.

00:44.019 --> 00:45.571
This ought to be interesting.

00:45.666 --> 00:48.707
Okay, Hawkeye,
tell me why we're cursed.

00:48.790 --> 00:51.020
How else do you explain
this run of bad luck?

00:51.097 --> 00:52.659
Attilan's destroyed,

00:52.736 --> 00:54.852
Inhumans get forced to register.

00:54.929 --> 00:57.060
We stand against it,
so our own government

00:57.137 --> 00:58.995
sends other Avengers after us.

00:59.072 --> 01:02.565
And we get arrested, Captain
America gets blasted...

01:09.878 --> 01:13.012
Hope Iron Man's having
better luck than we are.

01:16.751 --> 01:19.944
Hello, Tony. After all
we've been through,

01:20.021 --> 01:23.019
nothing for your old
friend, Truman Marsh?

01:23.096 --> 01:24.949
A sad sight.

01:25.026 --> 01:28.820
The great Tony Stark
rotting in solitary.

01:28.897 --> 01:32.298
Consider it payback
for trying to undermine me.

01:36.363 --> 01:38.968
This isn't over, Marsh!
The Avengers will...

01:39.045 --> 01:41.732
The Avengers are done.

01:41.809 --> 01:44.707
You and your team will spend
the rest of your lives

01:44.784 --> 01:47.010
wasting away in this hole.

01:47.087 --> 01:49.048
<i>So long, Stark.</i>

01:49.096 --> 01:51.763
See you again... Never.

01:57.926 --> 02:00.326
(BEEPING)

02:03.698 --> 02:06.996
(ALARM BLARING)
Step one: get out of cell.

02:07.073 --> 02:10.235
Step two: find the
other Avengers.

02:12.840 --> 02:15.974

This is awkward.

02:26.721 --> 02:29.052
Okay, Guardsmen,
I accept your surrender.

02:29.129 --> 02:32.984
Escaped prisoners
are to be terminated.

02:33.061 --> 02:35.961

Like me.

02:54.732 --> 02:56.865
Okay. Huh?

02:58.250 --> 02:59.868
This some kind of trick?

03:00.962 --> 03:02.158
It's a rescue.

03:02.235 --> 03:03.680
Widow!

03:03.728 --> 03:05.995
Funny, the people you meet in prison.
Huh? (ROBOTS APPROACHING)

03:06.072 --> 03:09.334
Through there! Go!
I brought backup.

03:12.073 --> 03:13.605
(GRUNTS)

03:14.524 --> 03:16.105
The backup has arrived.

03:16.182 --> 03:19.003
Black Bolt and Medusa
are helping us?

03:19.080 --> 03:21.430
You'll need to catch me up
on who's on whose side.

03:21.555 --> 03:24.313
After we find and free the others.
Already did.

03:24.390 --> 03:28.654
Natasha got us out before she got you.
'Cause she likes us better.

03:29.357 --> 03:31.387
Thought you might
want this back.

03:31.464 --> 03:33.366
Hulk, I could hug you.

03:33.530 --> 03:35.639
Except I know how
hugs make you angry.

03:35.772 --> 03:38.697
Come on. We still have
another teammate to find.

03:40.301 --> 03:42.569
Captain America
was badly injured.

03:42.701 --> 03:46.035
If they brought him here, we should
look for him in the infirmary.

03:46.112 --> 03:48.065
Black Bolt feels terrible.

03:48.142 --> 03:49.670
If he had known
what would happen,

03:49.811 --> 03:51.969
he never would've
agreed to registration.

03:52.061 --> 03:55.193
You were only trying to do what you
thought was best for your people.

03:55.332 --> 03:56.417
We were wrong,

03:56.627 --> 03:59.659
and we will do whatever
we must to set things right,

03:59.822 --> 04:01.983
before anyone else is hurt.

04:04.527 --> 04:05.927
IRON MAN: Cap!

04:09.197 --> 04:11.956
It's just not right
seeing him like this.

04:12.033 --> 04:13.772
Captain America's
indestructible.

04:13.912 --> 04:15.444
(GROWLS)
He's an Avenger.

04:15.560 --> 04:17.855
He is our Avenger.

04:18.373 --> 04:19.872
Let's get him outta here.

04:21.166 --> 04:22.725
More Guardsmen!

04:24.245 --> 04:26.142
Um, those aren't Guardsmen.

04:26.219 --> 04:29.378

hurt makes me mad,

04:29.455 --> 04:33.452

So did I, to tell you the truth.

05:43.090 --> 05:45.226
Why do I say that?
I always tell the truth.

05:45.320 --> 05:48.919

Falcon, take the others
and do the same.

06:04.633 --> 06:07.376
Keep it for a sec.
It's a good look on you.

06:07.453 --> 06:09.039

Yeah.

06:09.116 --> 06:12.181

06:31.344 --> 06:33.234
More lousy bots?

06:33.394 --> 06:36.528
Stay together, and target
them one at a time.

06:42.049 --> 06:44.041
(LAUGHS)
Just like bowling.

06:44.118 --> 06:46.015
Who wants to knock down the pin?

06:46.092 --> 06:47.450

06:58.065 --> 07:00.665

07:03.237 --> 07:05.704
(WHISPERS) Done. (ECHOING)

07:07.241 --> 07:08.933
Whoa!

07:09.010 --> 07:10.935
Glad he's on our side.

07:11.012 --> 07:12.141
BLACK WIDOW:
While you were locked up,

07:12.218 --> 07:14.939
our situation went
from bad to worse.

07:15.016 --> 07:17.113
Marsh has amped up
Inhuman registration.

07:17.190 --> 07:21.045
Strong-arm tactics, using
raids, arrests, and threats.

07:21.122 --> 07:24.020
Black Bolt feels we should
talk to Truman Marsh.

07:24.097 --> 07:26.989
Convince him to undo
the registration program.

07:27.066 --> 07:29.058
Perhaps we can reason with him.

07:29.135 --> 07:31.227
Marsh cannot be reasoned with.

07:31.304 --> 07:34.892
He doesn't even like me,
which is disturbing.

07:34.969 --> 07:36.293
Everyone likes me.

07:36.370 --> 07:38.434
I just don't get it. How did a
government bureaucrat like Marsh

07:38.511 --> 07:40.302
get so much power and authority?

07:40.379 --> 07:42.099
Picking up something strange.

07:42.176 --> 07:44.206
A signal just got bounced
off the satellite grid

07:44.283 --> 07:46.378
and shot out across
the whole planet.

07:49.550 --> 07:52.442
Hey. What gives?

07:52.519 --> 07:53.919
Black Bolt?

07:54.421 --> 07:56.621

landed around here...

08:20.231 --> 08:21.755
There he is.

08:21.832 --> 08:24.063
Without Mjolnir, I cannot fly,

08:24.140 --> 08:26.193
nor can I properly fight.

08:26.270 --> 08:28.300
(GRUNTS)
It's nearly here.

08:28.377 --> 08:30.164
I can feel it!

08:30.241 --> 08:32.765
That signal I picked
up on the Avenjet?

08:32.842 --> 08:34.240
Same signal's coming
from their necks.

08:34.317 --> 08:37.971
From their necks?
The registration disks.

08:38.048 --> 08:41.383
They're under mind control.
Try not to hurt 'em.

09:42.946 --> 09:45.647

most definitely will!

09:50.988 --> 09:52.468
Now for the disk.
(GROWLING)

09:59.997 --> 10:02.022
Thor's hit just

10:02.099 --> 10:04.963
Thor, we need another lightning strike.
This time at Medusa.

10:05.040 --> 10:07.232
A boulder? Where'd she
find a boulder?

10:07.309 --> 10:09.304

(YELLS)

10:14.144 --> 10:15.544
(GRUNTS)

10:21.118 --> 10:23.382
That signal was broadcast
all over the world.

10:23.459 --> 10:26.980
Now every Inhuman who registered
is under mind control.

10:27.057 --> 10:30.017
This is all our fault.
If only we hadn't agreed to...

10:30.094 --> 10:33.158
Ain't no angst like Inhuman angst.
It's not your fault.

10:33.235 --> 10:35.088
There's no need to apologize.

10:35.165 --> 10:38.925
<i>No need to apologize? I guess
that means we're all cool then.</i>

10:39.002 --> 10:42.267
Team, you remember our mighty
Avengers friends who arrested us.

10:42.344 --> 10:46.138
Good times. But the past is the
past, and things have changed.

10:46.215 --> 10:48.068
<i>Indeed. Despite our protests,</i>

10:48.145 --> 10:51.271
<i>Truman Marsh attempted to force Ms.
Marvel to register.</i>

10:51.348 --> 10:54.913
<i>Even though she was already working
on the side of the government.</i>

10:54.990 --> 10:56.943
<i>That was the final straw.</i>

10:57.020 --> 10:59.146
<i>So even Ms. Marvel
went into hiding.</i>

10:59.223 --> 11:01.987
<i>Then we quit working
for that pencil-neck Marsh.</i>

11:02.064 --> 11:03.884
<i>And that's how we got here.</i>

11:03.961 --> 11:05.924
<i>But we understand
if you're a little, uh,</i>

11:06.001 --> 11:08.861
<i>seriously ticked off at us
for having to arrest you.</i>

11:08.938 --> 11:11.024
Uh, kind of, yeah.

11:11.101 --> 11:12.898
We're on the same side now.

11:12.975 --> 11:16.029
And we have bigger
problems. Friday?

11:16.106 --> 11:18.337
<i>Within the last hour,
the Inhumans who registered</i>

11:18.414 --> 11:20.272
<i>have begun to attack humans.</i>

11:20.349 --> 11:23.870
<i>The media has named this
conflict "The Inhuman Wars."</i>

11:23.947 --> 11:26.245
We know the Inhumans
are being mind-controlled.

11:26.322 --> 11:28.909
But nobody out there knows that.

11:28.986 --> 11:30.883
Couldn't we use your lightning?

11:30.960 --> 11:34.815
Nay. Asgardian lightning
is an exact process.

11:34.892 --> 11:38.257
It would be impossible to target
every Inhuman on the planet.

11:38.334 --> 11:41.955
It doesn't make sense.
Marsh has to be behind this.

11:42.032 --> 11:45.230
But what does he have to gain by starting
a war between humans and Inhumans?

11:45.307 --> 11:46.927
Cap, go find out.

11:47.004 --> 11:49.201
Take Falcon, Black Bolt
and Medusa with you.

11:49.278 --> 11:52.099
Widow, take Hawkeye,
Hulk, Songbird and Thor.

11:52.176 --> 11:55.268

Get in there and stop it.

11:55.345 --> 11:57.042

12:46.964 --> 12:49.731
You and me, Karnak!
(GRUNTING)

12:52.903 --> 12:54.227
(GROANS)

12:54.304 --> 12:56.271
(KNUCKLES CRACK)

12:59.209 --> 13:03.378
Sensors indicate a single Inhuman
contact approaching straight ahead.

13:07.117 --> 13:08.909
Oh, not her.

13:08.986 --> 13:10.585
They've got Ms. Marvel.

13:13.924 --> 13:15.187
What are we doing here?

13:15.264 --> 13:17.918
We have one
registration disk intact.

13:17.995 --> 13:20.058
Your big brain and
your small expertise

13:20.135 --> 13:23.223
are gonna help me
deconstruct it.

13:23.300 --> 13:26.231
FALCON: I traced the signal that
activated the registration disks.

13:26.308 --> 13:29.504
It originated from
the Security Council, here.

13:33.110 --> 13:35.510
Everybody out!
It's wired to blow!

13:40.884 --> 13:42.964
CAPTAIN AMERICA:
Bigger things are in play.

13:47.190 --> 13:50.250
No! Do not do this!

13:50.327 --> 13:52.460
Do not do what?

13:56.166 --> 14:00.601
Wouldn't be right to hit a little girl.
I'll just have to blast her!

14:05.042 --> 14:06.442
(GRUNTS)

14:08.011 --> 14:10.645
(GRUNTING)
Hey! Let go!

14:11.882 --> 14:13.139
(WHIRRING)

14:13.216 --> 14:15.314
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

14:15.391 --> 14:17.352
(EXCLAIMS)

14:20.023 --> 14:21.219
Come on, Kamala.

14:21.296 --> 14:23.884
I'm your number one
favorite hero.

14:23.961 --> 14:25.924
You've written
fan fiction about me.

14:26.001 --> 14:27.662
You do not want this.

14:29.266 --> 14:30.698
(GRUNTS)

14:34.004 --> 14:35.968
The disk is shielded,
so we can't get a scan

14:36.045 --> 14:37.903
of what's inside
and makes it tick.

14:37.980 --> 14:40.000
You're thinking too
big. Think small.

14:40.077 --> 14:42.074
Small enough for us
to shrink under the shields

14:42.151 --> 14:44.343
and explore the disk
from the inside.

14:44.420 --> 14:46.211
We gotta stop this war.

14:46.288 --> 14:48.909
So let's get
a little bit little.

14:48.986 --> 14:51.149
(CLICKS)
Wait. How dangerous is this?

14:51.226 --> 14:54.355
Extremely. But it's best
not to think about it.

14:57.044 --> 14:59.277
ANT-MAN:
It worked!

15:00.013 --> 15:03.779
These design elements,
they're familiar.

15:03.856 --> 15:07.844
They almost
look like... Mine!

15:07.921 --> 15:12.457
Of course Truman Marsh would
steal my tech. (BEEPING)

15:14.027 --> 15:17.295
We should've known. The disk
has self-defense systems.

15:18.899 --> 15:21.199
Keep working.
I'll draw their fire.

15:22.836 --> 15:26.104
Hey, self-defenses, follow me!

15:27.741 --> 15:30.600
(YELLS)
That all you got?

15:30.677 --> 15:33.244
You guys ain't so tough.
(GRUNTS)

15:33.947 --> 15:35.347
(CLINKS)

15:37.818 --> 15:39.848
Situation's getting too hot!
(ALARM BEEPING)

15:39.925 --> 15:41.319
(GRUNTS)

15:42.055 --> 15:43.885
Iron Man, rise and shine.

15:43.962 --> 15:47.225
We've overstayed our
welcome. Come on, Tony!

15:47.894 --> 15:49.294
(GRUNTS)

15:50.831 --> 15:54.029
Well, we didn't get fried to a
crisp, but our disk wasn't so lucky.

15:54.106 --> 15:56.031
I managed to get a partial scan.

15:56.108 --> 15:58.662
It's not much, but if
we study the data,

15:58.739 --> 16:02.306
maybe we can find some way to
shut down the registration disks.

16:12.052 --> 16:14.452
(PULSATING HUMMING)

16:15.021 --> 16:17.155
(BEEPING)

16:18.658 --> 16:19.616
(BEEPING)

16:19.693 --> 16:21.225
Black Bolt, stop!

16:21.895 --> 16:24.888
No. You are wrong, husband.

16:24.965 --> 16:28.897
This will not allow the Inhumans
to choose their own destinies.

16:28.974 --> 16:30.860
This will end their futures.

16:30.937 --> 16:34.002
Uh, I was gonna ask you
why you took off like that,

16:34.079 --> 16:37.806
but now my questions are more
about the scary-looking machine.

16:37.883 --> 16:40.637
After the Terrigen wave
created new Inhumans,

16:40.714 --> 16:43.912
this device was developed to
potentially reverse the effects.

16:43.989 --> 16:46.743
To return Inhumans
back to their cocoon,

16:46.820 --> 16:50.747
allowing our people to choose whether
they wish to have powers or not.

16:50.824 --> 16:53.989
You had this machine, but didn't
use it to undo the Terrigen wave?

16:54.066 --> 16:55.957
The device was never perfected.

16:56.034 --> 16:58.788
For once someone is
put back into a cocoon,

16:58.865 --> 17:02.030
it leaves the Inhuman in a
permanent coma-like state.

17:02.107 --> 17:03.893
That's your plan, Black Bolt?

17:03.970 --> 17:06.867
To save your people,
you're going to turn them off?

17:06.944 --> 17:10.633
No, it is not the only
way to stop the war.

17:10.710 --> 17:12.741
You are not saving our people.

17:12.818 --> 17:17.348
You are taking them away.
Our family, you, me.

17:19.051 --> 17:21.845
Things look bleak,
but we can't lose hope.

17:21.922 --> 17:23.646
Hope is stronger
than any weapon,

17:23.723 --> 17:25.954
stronger than any prison,
stronger than any war.

17:26.031 --> 17:29.652
I know you blame yourself that the
Inhumans became mindless pawns,

17:29.729 --> 17:32.722
but you can't risk extinguishing
your people like this.

17:32.799 --> 17:35.063
Potentially losing them
forever is not the solution.

17:35.140 --> 17:36.932
This machine will
not bring peace.

17:37.009 --> 17:39.963
This machine is
flawed and dangerous.

17:40.040 --> 17:44.175
Don't do it, Black Bolt. Together,
we can find another way.

17:52.018 --> 17:53.676
(YELLS)

17:53.753 --> 17:55.153
(GRUNTS)

17:58.692 --> 18:01.957
That's enough! I've been holding
back because you're our friend.

18:02.034 --> 18:04.726
But I know how tough
you are, Kamala Khan.

18:04.803 --> 18:08.132
You wanna bring it?
Then bring it!

18:11.071 --> 18:12.471
(GRUNTS)

18:14.040 --> 18:16.040

18:21.748 --> 18:22.839
Whoa, Danvers.

18:22.916 --> 18:25.046
Take it easy.
She's just a kid.

18:25.123 --> 18:26.643
Ms. Marvel can take it.

18:26.720 --> 18:29.320
She's not just a kid,
she's an Avenger.

18:32.792 --> 18:35.159
(GRUNTING)

18:38.832 --> 18:40.056
At this close range,

18:40.133 --> 18:42.898
I may be able to superheat the
disk's internal components.

18:42.975 --> 18:45.000
Should I try or...
Vision!

18:45.077 --> 18:47.271
I will take that as a yes.

18:48.909 --> 18:50.900
(ALL GRUNTING)

18:50.977 --> 18:52.674
RED HULK:
Any time, Vision!

18:52.751 --> 18:54.042
(GRUNTING)

18:54.119 --> 18:56.113
Ahhh!

18:57.884 --> 19:00.048
Whoa! What
just happened?

19:00.125 --> 19:03.054
I mean, uh... Ow!

19:08.862 --> 19:10.262
(PUNCHES LANDING)

19:26.913 --> 19:30.045
(GROANS) We're never gonna
find a weakness in this disk.

19:30.122 --> 19:32.614
There are too many
gaps in the data.

19:32.691 --> 19:33.776
It's hopeless.

19:33.853 --> 19:36.952
It's not hopeless.
We just have to find it.

19:37.029 --> 19:38.954
Whatever it is.

19:39.031 --> 19:42.193
(BEEPING)
Huh? Hmm?

19:43.029 --> 19:44.092
(ALARM SOUNDING)
(GASPS)

19:44.169 --> 19:46.756
BOTH: Are you seeing
what I'm seeing?

19:46.833 --> 19:50.620
Widow, we've got a possible way to
disable the registration disks,

19:50.697 --> 19:53.668
<i>but we need help to get the
tech from Avengers Tower.</i>

19:53.745 --> 19:57.141
Avengers assemble!
Back at the Tower!

20:01.982 --> 20:03.640
I heard what happened.

20:03.717 --> 20:04.980
Good to see you back to normal.

20:05.057 --> 20:06.848
It's good to be back to normal.

20:06.925 --> 20:09.684
My normal, mostly
non-evil self.

20:09.761 --> 20:11.255
Avengers.

20:11.891 --> 20:14.856
Man, there are a lot of us.

20:14.933 --> 20:16.261
Come on.

20:16.830 --> 20:19.055
You always were very clever.

20:19.132 --> 20:20.862
But if you think I'm
going to just let you

20:20.939 --> 20:24.666
undo my registration
disks, you're wrong.

20:24.743 --> 20:25.662
Marsh!

20:25.739 --> 20:28.136
I call first dibs
on smashing his face.

20:28.213 --> 20:30.667
I call second.

20:30.744 --> 20:33.937
Are you trying to
threaten the Avengers?

20:34.014 --> 20:36.011
We're Earth's mightiest heroes.

20:36.088 --> 20:39.681
You're just a deluded
schlub in a bad suit.

20:39.758 --> 20:41.419
Still wrong.

20:45.158 --> 20:46.821
Ultron?
(MUFFLED GASP)

20:46.898 --> 20:48.818
Surprised to see me?

20:48.895 --> 20:52.727
But now it all starts
to make sense, doesn't it?

20:52.804 --> 20:54.929
Not that it matters now.

20:55.006 --> 20:58.102
I have been biding my time.

20:59.773 --> 21:02.070
Letting you think you've won,

21:02.147 --> 21:05.602
studying your every move,

21:05.679 --> 21:07.108
setting up the pieces,

21:07.185 --> 21:11.608
watching you do
exactly what I wanted.

21:11.685 --> 21:15.884
I'd hoped humans and Inhumans would
annihilate each other for me.

21:15.961 --> 21:19.988
But if I want the job done right,
I'll have to do it myself.

21:20.065 --> 21:23.091
Now a new world order,

21:23.168 --> 21:26.430
the Ultron Revolution!
