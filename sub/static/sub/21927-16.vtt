00:04.922 --> 00:06.129
<i>On any given day,</i>

00:06.340 --> 00:07.955
<i>our school gymnasium</i>

00:08.175 --> 00:10.508
<i>presented
a cocktail of horrors.</i>

00:12.095 --> 00:14.337
<i>From daily humiliation...</i>

00:17.267 --> 00:19.304
<i>...to school-sanctioned
violence...</i>

00:19.561 --> 00:20.176
<i>Oh!</i>

00:20.395 --> 00:23.934
<i>But one day a year,
the gymnasium was transformed</i>

00:24.149 --> 00:25.811
<i>into a haven of learning</i>

00:26.026 --> 00:28.359
<i>thanks to a remarkable
institution</i>

00:28.570 --> 00:30.277
<i>known as the science fair.</i>

00:30.489 --> 00:33.357
<i>A chance for the student body
to come together</i>

00:33.575 --> 00:35.487
<i>in the name of research
and progress.</i>

00:35.702 --> 00:37.659
<i>Uh, while some did
the bare minimum...</i>

00:40.123 --> 00:43.616
<i>...and others preferred
razzamatazz over raw data,</i>

00:44.336 --> 00:48.421
<i>I set out to save humanity
from deadly asteroids.</i>

00:48.632 --> 00:50.794
<i>And made it all neatly fit
on three poster boards.</i>

00:51.969 --> 00:54.211
<i>The science fair may be
a competition,</i>

00:54.429 --> 00:58.048
<i>but when the goal is promoting
knowledge, we're all winners.</i>

00:58.267 --> 00:59.007
<i>And the winner</i>

00:59.226 --> 01:01.934
<i>of the Medford High School
Science Fair is...</i>

01:02.646 --> 01:04.262
SueAnn Ludlow!

01:04.730 --> 01:06.267
You've got to be kidding me!

01:06.483 --> 01:07.098
Shelly.

01:08.777 --> 01:10.063
You people are crazy!

01:10.279 --> 01:11.190
- Hey.
- All right.

01:11.405 --> 01:12.646
You're celebrating mediocrity!

01:14.032 --> 01:15.398
Mediocrity!

01:15.617 --> 01:17.074
<i>Mediocrity!</i>

01:36.722 --> 01:37.883
I'll be in my room.

01:38.098 --> 01:38.963
Oh, come on, Shelly.

01:39.182 --> 01:40.673
You still got
an honorable mention.

01:40.892 --> 01:42.383
Stop reminding me.

01:43.729 --> 01:45.846
I hate to see him
so upset.

01:46.064 --> 01:48.181
Well, give him a little
time, he'll calm down.

01:49.568 --> 01:50.854
<i>Fiddle-faddle!</i>

01:51.069 --> 01:52.025
The F word.

01:52.237 --> 01:53.398
He's real mad.

01:53.614 --> 01:55.401
You don't always win in life,
he needs to learn that.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.903
I know, but these are
big feelings for a little boy.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.404
They're feelings everybody has.

01:59.620 --> 02:00.861
It's part of growing up.

02:01.330 --> 02:02.241
I guess.

02:02.456 --> 02:03.867
<i>Poodle poop!</i>

02:04.124 --> 02:04.989
<i>Okay.</i>

02:05.208 --> 02:05.994
Somebody's got to teach

02:06.209 --> 02:08.997
this kid to swear,
it's embarrassing.

02:14.384 --> 02:15.340
Sheldon, listen,

02:15.594 --> 02:16.801
<i>I know losing
ain't easy.</i>

02:17.012 --> 02:18.969
I deal with it on the
football field all the time.

02:23.644 --> 02:26.352
It's like that big game we had
last year against Nacogdoches.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.890
We were down 28 points
at the half.

02:30.108 --> 02:31.565
It was raining, it was muddy.

02:31.777 --> 02:33.939
Everybody in the stands
had gone home.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.316
But somehow,
we managed to claw our way back

02:36.531 --> 02:38.022
to a tie with a minute left.

02:39.201 --> 02:40.282
And then, they threw
a Hail Mary,

02:40.494 --> 02:41.450
and the receiver stepped
out of bounds,

02:41.662 --> 02:42.948
but the ref didn't see it.

02:44.081 --> 02:47.040
After all that,
we lose on a bad call.

02:48.460 --> 02:50.167
Believe me, I was furious.

02:51.588 --> 02:52.920
But I sucked it up,

02:53.548 --> 02:56.040
and I walked across that field
and I shook their hands.

02:58.303 --> 03:00.636
I didn't hear a word you said.

03:02.516 --> 03:03.472
Okay.

03:04.976 --> 03:06.683
<i>So while an animal cell
has a membrane,</i>

03:06.895 --> 03:10.184
a plant cell has a membrane
and a cell wall.

03:10.399 --> 03:11.640
<i>Who cares?</i>

03:12.192 --> 03:13.478
<i>Sheldon,
what are you doing?</i>

03:13.694 --> 03:15.151
Being disrespectful, sir.

03:15.362 --> 03:16.773
Ah. How come?

03:16.988 --> 03:19.901
Because I'm disillusioned
with the school system.

03:20.951 --> 03:22.567
Georgie, do you know
what's going on with him?

03:22.828 --> 03:24.945
Actually, I'm trying
to ignore it.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.072
Well, get your feet
off the desk.

03:27.374 --> 03:28.831
What if I don't?

03:29.042 --> 03:31.409
I was sent to see
Principal Petersen.

03:31.628 --> 03:32.835
What is it this time?

03:33.046 --> 03:34.253
Youthful rebellion.

03:34.464 --> 03:37.172
My voice hasn't changed yet,
but my attitude has.

03:37.551 --> 03:38.667
I'll let him know you're here.

03:38.885 --> 03:39.716
You do that.

03:41.054 --> 03:41.965
Ma'am.

03:47.352 --> 03:48.888
Sheldon Cooper's outside.

03:49.980 --> 03:50.891
Who sent him now?

03:51.106 --> 03:52.893
- Givens.
- Well, you know what?

03:53.150 --> 03:54.857
Givens needs to man up.

03:55.152 --> 03:55.812
<i>Cooper's
a little boy.</i>

03:56.027 --> 03:57.268
It's not hard to handle him.

03:57.487 --> 03:58.193
I'll send him in.

03:58.405 --> 04:00.021
H-Hold on a minute, just...

04:00.407 --> 04:01.488
Does he know I'm in here?

04:02.117 --> 04:04.359
<i>Attention, students and faculty.</i>

04:04.578 --> 04:05.694
Oh, no.

04:05.912 --> 04:07.653
This is Sheldon Lee Cooper.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.580
What the hell?

04:11.001 --> 04:13.835
We're taught that hard work
pays off, but that's not true.

04:14.045 --> 04:15.752
<i>I came up with a solution
to save Earth</i>

04:15.964 --> 04:17.329
<i>from killer asteroids,</i>

04:17.548 --> 04:19.255
<i>and lost the science fair</i>

04:19.468 --> 04:22.005
to SueAnn Ludlow,
and her frizzy hair machine.

04:22.512 --> 04:25.300
<i>But it wasn't just me who lost,
we all lost.</i>

04:25.515 --> 04:26.756
<i>Wake up, people.</i>

04:26.975 --> 04:28.762
<i>The system's broken.</i>

04:28.977 --> 04:31.094
Real innovation isn't valued.

04:31.396 --> 04:34.059
<i>Nowadays, it's all about
flash and style.</i>

04:34.274 --> 04:35.685
I blame MTV.

04:35.984 --> 04:38.397
<i>Luckily, my parents
can't afford cable.</i>

04:38.695 --> 04:39.776
We can afford it.

04:41.072 --> 04:43.234
<i>I urge you all to rise up.</i>

04:44.493 --> 04:45.324
They can't send everyone

04:45.535 --> 04:46.651
to the principal's office.

04:46.870 --> 04:48.111
Chew gum in class,

04:48.455 --> 04:49.411
use a number one pencil,

04:49.623 --> 04:50.659
<i>go nuts.</i>

04:50.874 --> 04:52.456
This is Sheldon Lee Cooper
signing off.

04:52.751 --> 04:53.992
Live long and prosper.

04:54.711 --> 04:56.327
You better run, you little punk!

05:00.675 --> 05:02.667
<i>I can't believe you sent
him to bed without his dinner.</i>

05:02.886 --> 05:03.842
That's right.

05:04.054 --> 05:05.340
On spaghetti and
hot dog night.

05:05.555 --> 05:06.966
- That's rough.
- He's got to learn.

05:07.182 --> 05:09.094
Let's talk about something else.

05:09.476 --> 05:10.842
Georgie, how was your day?

05:11.061 --> 05:13.724
My brother told the entire
school we can't afford cable.

05:14.064 --> 05:16.021
Oh, right. Missy?

05:16.233 --> 05:18.395
Good, until I learned
we can't afford cable.

05:20.403 --> 05:23.111
I've been thinking, and there's
something I'd like to say.

05:23.406 --> 05:25.523
Unless it's an apology,
I don't want to hear it.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.116
I'm quitting science.

05:29.079 --> 05:30.320
Not an apology.

05:30.539 --> 05:31.746
Spank him, Dad.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.130
I'm really getting
worried about Shelly.

05:42.384 --> 05:44.216
Acting out,
and now quitting science?

05:44.427 --> 05:46.635
Oh, I'm sure he'll get
right back to it.

05:46.847 --> 05:49.464
I've quit smoking and gambling
plenty of times.

05:49.683 --> 05:50.799
Hmm. Look in my purse.

05:51.017 --> 05:53.760
Nothing but cigarettes
and scratchers.

05:54.104 --> 05:55.640
Maybe he should
talk to somebody.

05:55.856 --> 05:56.812
Not it.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.189
I meant a professional, George.

05:59.526 --> 06:00.733
But way to be a dad.

06:12.414 --> 06:13.530
Hey.

06:13.748 --> 06:14.488
Welcome back.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.916
Thank you for seeing us
on such short notice, Doctor.

06:17.127 --> 06:18.243
Oh, not a problem.

06:18.712 --> 06:19.327
Sheldon,

06:19.546 --> 06:20.457
I remember you.

06:20.672 --> 06:21.662
Do you remember me?

06:21.965 --> 06:23.331
I remember everything.

06:24.426 --> 06:25.041
Okay.

06:25.343 --> 06:26.504
<i>Uh, you two, make
yourselves comfortable.</i>

06:26.720 --> 06:28.006
Me and my main man Sheldon
are gonna go

06:28.221 --> 06:29.837
have a little chitchat
in my office.

06:30.181 --> 06:32.514
I don't like chitchat,
and I'm not your main man.

06:33.476 --> 06:34.136
Right on.

06:34.477 --> 06:35.593
Have fun.

06:39.024 --> 06:41.186
Now, Sheldon, I understand
you've changed your mind

06:41.401 --> 06:42.812
about being a scientist.

06:43.695 --> 06:45.152
And you're gonna
say I can't?

06:45.780 --> 06:47.362
No. I think that's great.

06:47.699 --> 06:49.156
- You do?
- Yeah.

06:49.367 --> 06:51.575
I think it's important
to keep your options open.

06:51.786 --> 06:53.027
Let me tell you a little story

06:53.246 --> 06:55.408
about an extremely smart
young boy.

06:55.874 --> 06:56.614
Me?

06:56.833 --> 06:57.698
Me.

06:58.209 --> 06:58.915
<i>For the longest time,</i>

06:59.127 --> 06:59.958
I thought I was gonna be

07:00.170 --> 07:01.661
a professional figure skater.

07:01.880 --> 07:04.714
And then you became disenchanted
with the field like I did?

07:04.925 --> 07:05.631
<i>Exactly.</i>

07:05.842 --> 07:07.504
Someone skated
right over my foot.

07:07.719 --> 07:08.709
And that was that.

07:09.387 --> 07:11.219
I'm not sure
that's the same thing.

07:11.431 --> 07:15.425
I'd say you lost your passion
the way I lost my big toe.

07:16.603 --> 07:17.684
Hmm.

07:21.191 --> 07:22.898
Don't draw in that.

07:23.735 --> 07:25.397
Hey. We're all done.

07:25.820 --> 07:27.186
- How'd it go?
- Great.

07:27.405 --> 07:28.896
I feel a lot better.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.822
Well, that's
just wonderful.

07:31.034 --> 07:32.400
So, you're going back
to science?

07:32.619 --> 07:36.158
No. In fact, I'm going as far
away from science as possible.

07:36.373 --> 07:38.239
I plan to pursue the arts.

07:38.833 --> 07:39.869
What kind of arts?

07:40.085 --> 07:42.077
I've decided to become an actor.

07:43.672 --> 07:45.129
Of course you have.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.667
Why's he want to study acting?

07:50.053 --> 07:52.136
The doctor encouraged him
to try something different.

07:52.347 --> 07:54.054
Maybe he'll learn
to act normal.

07:54.265 --> 07:55.881
How about you learn
to act nice?

07:56.101 --> 07:58.764
You people don't appreciate my sense of humor.

07:59.062 --> 08:00.769
As long as he starts behaving
himself in school,

08:00.981 --> 08:02.768
I don't care what he does.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.145
You know, I actually did
a little community theater

08:05.360 --> 08:06.350
back in my 20s.

08:06.569 --> 08:07.559
Is that so?

08:07.779 --> 08:09.816
I had a good part
in <i>Oklahoma.</i>

08:13.076 --> 08:14.066
Say no to what?

08:14.285 --> 08:14.900
Well...

08:15.120 --> 08:16.907
To, uh, eating
her vegetables.

08:17.998 --> 08:18.784
It was fun.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.615
<i>But I'm pretty sure
doing plays</i>

08:20.834 --> 08:23.827
is just an excuse to change in
front of each other backstage.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.251
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:25.463 --> 08:27.955
Theater folk just love to
take their clothes off.

08:28.174 --> 08:29.540
How many people
saw you naked?

08:29.759 --> 08:30.590
A lot.

08:30.802 --> 08:31.963
- Mom.
- Enough.

08:33.013 --> 08:33.844
Y'all don't understand

08:34.054 --> 08:35.842
my sense of humor, either.

08:44.983 --> 08:46.940
Hello. Are you Mr. Lundy?

08:47.152 --> 08:49.109
My father is Mr. Lundy.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.027
Well, then what should
I call you?

08:53.324 --> 08:54.280
I guess Mr. Lundy.

08:54.492 --> 08:56.199
My father's dead.

08:56.786 --> 08:59.119
I was told you're the head
of the drama department.

08:59.330 --> 09:01.822
Mm-hmm, and the girls'
volleyball coach,

09:02.042 --> 09:05.001
which, between us,
is the real drama department.

09:05.211 --> 09:06.497
Was that a joke?

09:07.172 --> 09:08.333
I thought so.

09:10.341 --> 09:11.627
Can I help you?

09:12.052 --> 09:14.294
I'm interested
in becoming an actor.

09:14.512 --> 09:16.253
Well, good for you.

09:16.473 --> 09:17.930
You've come to the right place.

09:18.141 --> 09:20.349
You know, I-I've been
a professional actor

09:20.560 --> 09:21.641
for years and years.

09:21.853 --> 09:23.469
Really? What have you been in?

09:23.688 --> 09:25.850
Well, have you seen
the mattress madness commercials

09:26.066 --> 09:27.398
on channel 68?

09:28.026 --> 09:29.858
<i>I'm soft and firm</i>

09:30.070 --> 09:32.983
<i>in all the right places.</i>

09:35.241 --> 09:36.482
Wow. You're famous.

09:36.701 --> 09:37.817
Well, I...

09:38.036 --> 09:40.323
And I was Carbucketty

09:40.538 --> 09:43.326
in the Dallas-Fort Worth
Players production of <i>Cats.</i>

09:44.375 --> 09:45.991
Did you see that?

09:46.211 --> 09:47.998
No, I'm afraid of cats.

09:48.213 --> 09:50.671
Well, you realize the cats
are just the actors.

09:50.882 --> 09:52.293
I still wouldn't risk it.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.918
You're an odd boy,
but you make it work.

09:56.387 --> 09:58.344
Anyway, uh,
auditions are next week.

09:58.556 --> 10:00.172
- You're welcome to come on by.
<i>- Excellent.</i>

10:00.391 --> 10:01.848
I checked out a book on acting

10:02.060 --> 10:03.722
so I should have the hang of it
by then.

10:04.229 --> 10:05.970
Well, I like that confidence.

10:06.189 --> 10:09.227
Thank you. Most people
find it off-putting.

10:10.735 --> 10:11.816
I can see that.

10:14.155 --> 10:17.489
<i>To master acting,
I immersed myself</i>

10:17.700 --> 10:21.159
<i>in all forms of the genre,
from silent films</i>

10:22.580 --> 10:24.492
<i>to modern classics...</i>

10:31.339 --> 10:34.377
<i>...to logic-defying
experimental work.</i>

10:36.594 --> 10:37.926
Why are they all singing?

10:38.263 --> 10:39.970
Because it's a musical.

10:40.181 --> 10:41.968
But why can't
they just say it?

10:42.183 --> 10:44.721
Well, that wouldn't be
very musical, would it?

10:47.397 --> 10:49.138
And where is the
music coming from?

10:49.524 --> 10:51.982
You're thinking
about it too much.

10:55.947 --> 10:57.779
And how do they all know
the same dance?

10:57.991 --> 10:59.402
- Come on.
- Moonpie.

11:01.786 --> 11:03.277
<i>And it is intercepted.</i>

11:03.913 --> 11:07.406
<i>Walking in is Kevin Smith
for the touchdown.</i>

11:10.003 --> 11:11.084
What are you looking for?

11:11.796 --> 11:13.003
A brooch.

11:13.214 --> 11:14.546
What's a brooch?

11:14.757 --> 11:16.373
It's a piece of jewelry.

11:16.593 --> 11:18.710
In my acting book,
there's an exercise

11:18.928 --> 11:21.671
where you look for a missing
brooch in a convincing way.

11:22.056 --> 11:22.671
Why?

11:22.891 --> 11:25.258
According to the story,
it was given to me by a friend

11:25.476 --> 11:29.060
so I could afford to stay in
drama school, but now it's gone.

11:29.314 --> 11:30.771
Well, good luck finding it.

11:30.982 --> 11:31.972
Thanks.

11:32.192 --> 11:32.898
Wait.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.652
You really believed I was
looking for something.

11:37.614 --> 11:38.775
I did it.

11:38.990 --> 11:39.980
I'm an actor.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.486
You're a freak.

11:42.827 --> 11:45.786
Oh, where the heck
is that brooch?

11:48.041 --> 11:49.407
<i>If I can change,</i>

11:49.792 --> 11:51.374
and you can change,

11:52.128 --> 11:54.040
everybody can change.

11:54.547 --> 11:55.537
Thank you, Eva.

11:55.757 --> 11:59.842
That was a-a lovely
reading from <i>Rocky IV.</i>

12:00.094 --> 12:02.086
All right, Mr. Cooper.

12:02.305 --> 12:03.421
The stage is yours.

12:05.058 --> 12:05.798
Thank you.

12:06.684 --> 12:09.677
I'd like to begin with
a monologue from <i>King Lear.</i>

12:13.149 --> 12:13.764
What?

12:14.359 --> 12:16.817
I believe you're supposed to say
"break a leg."

12:17.028 --> 12:18.109
Sorry.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.104
Break a leg.

12:23.201 --> 12:27.036
Poor naked wretches,
whereso'er you are,

12:27.247 --> 12:30.991
that bide the pelting
of this pitiless storm.

12:31.417 --> 12:35.036
How shall your houseless heads
and unfed sides,

12:35.380 --> 12:38.248
your looped and windowed
raggedness defend you

12:38.466 --> 12:40.799
from seasons such as these?

12:42.220 --> 12:45.554
Oh, I've ta'en too little
care of this.

12:46.683 --> 12:48.970
Take physic, pomp.

12:49.352 --> 12:52.470
Expose thyself to feel
what wretches feel,

12:52.689 --> 12:55.022
that thou may shake
the superflux to them

12:55.233 --> 12:59.022
and show the heavens more just.

13:00.822 --> 13:02.358
Holy mackerel.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.541
Ah.

14:07.221 --> 14:08.678
That looked dangerous.

14:08.890 --> 14:11.257
No, that looks dangerous.

14:11.476 --> 14:12.808
We're back.

14:13.019 --> 14:15.102
Hey. How'd the audition go?

14:15.313 --> 14:16.645
Great. I got the lead.

14:17.065 --> 14:17.851
You're kidding.

14:18.066 --> 14:19.398
What's the play?

14:19.859 --> 14:20.565
<i>Annie.</i>

14:22.278 --> 14:23.985
I need to go learn my lines.

14:27.450 --> 14:29.908
Now, I was a little unsure
at first,

14:30.119 --> 14:32.702
but Sandy Duncan does
play Peter Pan,

14:32.914 --> 14:33.825
so when you think about it...

14:34.040 --> 14:34.746
Connie, you're not helping.

14:34.957 --> 14:35.743
Okay.

14:47.387 --> 14:48.047
Hey.

14:49.305 --> 14:49.965
Hello.

14:51.265 --> 14:53.382
I want to talk to you
about this play.

14:53.768 --> 14:55.179
I'm excited about it, too.

14:57.063 --> 14:58.395
You know, if you play
the part of a girl,

14:58.606 --> 14:59.892
people might make fun of you.

15:00.108 --> 15:01.974
Mr. Lundy's trying
to push the boundaries

15:02.193 --> 15:03.650
of drama in East Texas.

15:03.861 --> 15:06.899
One way to do that
is cross-gender casting.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.272
Let me rephrase that:

15:08.491 --> 15:09.732
if you play the part of a girl,

15:09.951 --> 15:11.738
people <i>will</i> make fun of you.

15:11.953 --> 15:14.661
In Shakespeare's time, the men
played all the female parts.

15:14.872 --> 15:15.783
No one made fun of it.

15:15.998 --> 15:17.079
If Shakespeare went
to public high school,

15:17.291 --> 15:18.702
it'd be a different story.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.750
You know, Sandy Duncan plays
the part of Peter Pan...

15:20.962 --> 15:22.874
Yeah, yeah, I heard.

15:28.594 --> 15:29.835
I'm trying to protect you, son.

15:30.847 --> 15:31.837
I appreciate that.

15:32.223 --> 15:33.009
Good.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.466
You're a football coach.

15:35.685 --> 15:36.721
Isn't it your responsibility

15:36.936 --> 15:38.928
to put in the best player
for the job?

15:39.564 --> 15:40.771
I guess.

15:42.191 --> 15:44.103
Well, I want to do this,

15:44.735 --> 15:47.193
and Mr. Lundy said
I was the best.

15:50.283 --> 15:51.273
Okay.

15:52.994 --> 15:54.860
Can you at least wear pants
instead of a dress?

15:55.621 --> 15:57.328
I'll give you a definite maybe.

16:04.380 --> 16:05.962
Okay, who's excited?

16:06.174 --> 16:09.042
I don't want to see Sheldon's
stupid play, it's humiliating.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.009
That's why I want to see it.

16:11.220 --> 16:12.176
We're going to support
your brother.

16:12.388 --> 16:14.675
Not another word about it.

16:16.893 --> 16:17.804
Can we at least sit
in the back?

16:18.019 --> 16:19.055
Not a word.

16:21.606 --> 16:23.393
Well, I'm excited.

16:28.279 --> 16:31.522
Okay, everybody,
ten minutes to curtain.

16:31.741 --> 16:33.903
No smiling, girls,
it's a hard knock life.

16:34.118 --> 16:35.780
How you doing,
Mr. Cooper?

16:35.995 --> 16:37.861
You in touch with
your inner Annie?

16:38.331 --> 16:39.196
I believe so.

16:39.415 --> 16:41.281
Good. It's a packed house.

16:42.710 --> 16:43.325
<i>Wha... oh, what the heck?</i>

16:43.544 --> 16:45.877
Katie? Katie.
You're an orphan,

16:46.047 --> 16:47.413
sweetheart, not a coal miner.

16:47.632 --> 16:49.464
Let's tone that down, hmm?

17:04.190 --> 17:05.226
Oh, dear.

17:05.983 --> 17:07.098
I can't do this.

17:07.568 --> 17:08.648
What are you talking about?

17:08.861 --> 17:10.021
The play,
I can't do it.

17:10.238 --> 17:11.648
There are
too many people out there.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.355
Oh, that is just stage fright.

17:13.574 --> 17:14.859
That's completely normal.

17:15.076 --> 17:17.113
No, this is a full-blown
panic attack.

17:17.328 --> 17:18.694
All right, listen to me.

17:18.954 --> 17:19.911
You're feeling scared.

17:20.122 --> 17:22.955
I get that,
but what you have to understand

17:23.166 --> 17:25.910
is you're not going out
on that stage alone.

17:26.295 --> 17:27.911
Everybody, gather around, hmm?

17:28.923 --> 17:29.834
Uh, Sheldon,

17:30.675 --> 17:32.086
have you ever been
to the circus?

17:32.301 --> 17:32.916
Yes.

17:33.135 --> 17:33.875
Okay, good.

17:34.095 --> 17:35.586
I had a panic attack there, too.

17:36.514 --> 17:37.880
My point is,

17:38.099 --> 17:42.139
the trapeze artist
always performs with a net

17:42.520 --> 17:44.557
to catch him,
to protect him.

17:44.814 --> 17:49.229
And you are protected
by everyone standing here.

17:49.860 --> 17:52.819
Nothing can happen to
you out on that stage,

17:53.030 --> 17:54.737
because we're a team.

17:54.949 --> 17:58.283
We are your net.

17:59.579 --> 18:00.365
I don't know.

18:02.582 --> 18:03.698
Sheldon, come here.

18:05.251 --> 18:05.957
You...

18:06.752 --> 18:08.209
are a star,

18:09.672 --> 18:10.879
and that audience

18:11.340 --> 18:14.959
deserves to see you shine.

18:21.058 --> 18:23.596
<i>Mr. Lundy gave
a compelling speech.</i>

18:24.186 --> 18:27.224
<i>The audience did deserve
to see what they came for,</i>

18:27.440 --> 18:29.602
<i>an eager boy bravely taking on</i>

18:30.109 --> 18:32.442
<i>the role
of Little Orphan Annie.</i>

18:32.653 --> 18:34.565
You're looking for
a knuckle sandwich.

18:35.239 --> 18:38.573
<i>And in that respect,
they were not disappointed.</i>

18:38.951 --> 18:40.738
Pipe down, all of you.

18:41.037 --> 18:42.403
Go back to sleep.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.239
It's all right, Molly.

18:45.458 --> 18:46.619
Annie's here.

18:48.210 --> 18:49.496
Oh, thank God.

18:50.004 --> 18:52.462
<i>I'd tell you how
an East Texas audience</i>

18:52.673 --> 18:54.380
<i>in 1989 responded</i>

18:54.592 --> 18:56.584
<i>to a grown man playing Annie,</i>

18:58.262 --> 19:00.003
<i>but I think you know.</i>

19:00.222 --> 19:01.554
Mm-hmm.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.678
What's my line?

19:30.336 --> 19:31.952
I think I see his underpants.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.378
I told you.

19:33.589 --> 19:36.206
Theatre folk just love to
show off their business.
