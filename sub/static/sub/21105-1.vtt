01:51.130 --> 01:53.064
Yeah, hon, I'll try
to get out of here.

01:54.199 --> 01:55.800
You little putz.

01:56.135 --> 01:57.735
Not you, hon.

01:58.237 --> 01:59.837
What are you making?

02:00.973 --> 02:03.041
Turkey giblet casserole?

02:03.442 --> 02:05.209
'Oh, my god.'

02:06.011 --> 02:07.845
'Jesus.'

03:23.789 --> 03:26.424
I think that belongs
in the lost and found.

03:26.426 --> 03:29.494
Uh, yeah. I was, I was
looking for the ID in there.

03:32.197 --> 03:35.833
You know, I just
literally sent the report

03:35.835 --> 03:39.003
to your parole officer
this morning.

03:39.005 --> 03:41.205
I said good things about you.

03:43.041 --> 03:45.777
'You finish off your shift
and you're done.'

03:47.780 --> 03:49.881
make sure you empty
the trash bins.

03:59.491 --> 04:03.194
Oi! Watch it, rugrats.
This is not a playground.

04:06.331 --> 04:08.299
Sugar high.

04:08.301 --> 04:10.067
'Eww. What happened
to your skin?'

04:10.069 --> 04:11.936
hey, come here.

04:11.938 --> 04:13.971
Why don't you get out of here,
you little shit?

04:15.274 --> 04:17.875
- They're just kids.
- Bad breeding.

04:19.444 --> 04:21.312
You look good.

04:25.050 --> 04:28.352
Hey, the lockers were closed.
I saw your bag on the bleachers.

04:28.354 --> 04:30.254
So I put my stuff in there.
Is it cool?

04:30.256 --> 04:33.925
Cool. You coming in?
It's heated.

04:33.927 --> 04:35.960
It's an upgrade
from what I remember.

04:35.962 --> 04:38.229
The place remodeled.
A lot has changed.

04:39.464 --> 04:40.965
Yeah.

04:50.609 --> 04:53.878
Jonna, I'm glad you came.
It's been too long.

04:55.414 --> 04:59.550
Well, you know, it was
either this or sit at home

04:59.552 --> 05:01.619
and listen to mom bitch
about her stupid boyfriend.

05:01.621 --> 05:03.254
What's his name again?
Phil or Steve?

05:03.256 --> 05:05.623
- Steve.
- Steve. Whatever.

05:08.327 --> 05:11.362
So how long has it been?

05:11.364 --> 05:14.899
Three months, two weeks
and 14 hours.

05:14.901 --> 05:16.901
I'm proud of you.

05:18.337 --> 05:20.137
To hell with this.

05:22.875 --> 05:24.175
Remember sophomore year,
we use to bet

05:24.177 --> 05:25.476
who could race around
the pool the fastest?

05:25.478 --> 05:27.879
- Oh, come on, Bree.
- Come on.

05:27.881 --> 05:29.513
Maybe you could break
another swimming record.

05:29.515 --> 05:31.115
Loser buys dinner.

05:31.117 --> 05:33.484
Yeah, I'm, uh, I'm
at minus five in the bank

05:33.486 --> 05:35.386
so you're getting dinner
either way.

05:35.388 --> 05:37.054
Deal.

05:44.930 --> 05:46.364
'Come on, wimp.'

05:46.366 --> 05:48.099
you know,
I'm gonna own you, right?

05:48.101 --> 05:50.434
- Oh, yeah?
- So good on you.

06:00.312 --> 06:03.481
Let's go, time to go.
We're closing up.

06:08.954 --> 06:12.356
Ladies, we closing up.
You need to get out of the pool.

06:12.358 --> 06:14.525
- You're open till 7:00.
- It's a holiday weekend.

06:14.527 --> 06:17.495
You see all the signs
hanging up around here?

06:17.497 --> 06:21.232
Some people need to learn
how to read.

06:21.234 --> 06:23.668
Some people need to learn
how to kiss my ass.

06:30.442 --> 06:33.244
There's something
I wanna show you.

06:33.246 --> 06:34.712
Yeah?

06:34.714 --> 06:36.314
Thank you all for coming.

06:36.316 --> 06:38.449
Have a pleasant holiday weekend.

06:38.451 --> 06:41.285
'The katea public pool
is now closed.'

06:41.287 --> 06:43.154
- what are you looking for?
- My ring.

06:43.156 --> 06:45.189
I, I had it right here.

06:45.191 --> 06:47.959
- What ring?
- Just my ring.

06:50.329 --> 06:52.663
Well, I mean, are you sure
you even brought it?

06:52.665 --> 06:54.098
Maybe you left it at home
or something.

06:54.100 --> 06:56.067
No, I'm positive.

06:59.105 --> 07:01.706
- That means you too.
- One minute!

07:03.041 --> 07:04.475
Let's go.

07:13.018 --> 07:14.685
Hang on.

07:14.687 --> 07:16.754
I think I can see
something down here.

07:21.626 --> 07:23.786
- I don't see anything.
- Down by the hole right there.

07:25.530 --> 07:26.697
Hey, how the hell
did you see that?

07:26.699 --> 07:29.100
Well, I mean, is that it?

07:29.102 --> 07:30.534
That's it.

07:38.377 --> 07:40.378
Thank you very much for coming.

07:42.547 --> 07:44.548
Have a good weekend.

07:47.586 --> 07:49.720
Just get the hell out.

08:38.602 --> 08:40.571
About damn time.

10:07.225 --> 10:09.760
Are you okay?

10:09.762 --> 10:13.264
Oh, god. Oh, god.

10:13.266 --> 10:15.766
No, I'm not okay! I'm trapped
in a fucking pool, Bree!

10:15.768 --> 10:18.569
We aren't trapped.

10:18.571 --> 10:20.838
Shit, my ring's
still down there.

10:20.840 --> 10:23.507
Oh, screw your damn ring.

10:23.509 --> 10:25.342
I'm sure
someone's still out there.

10:25.344 --> 10:27.278
- Hello?
- Hello!

10:27.280 --> 10:29.180
- We're in the pool!
- 'We're in the pool!'

10:29.182 --> 10:31.815
we're in here!
We're trapped in here!

10:31.817 --> 10:33.684
'Hello!'

10:35.687 --> 10:37.488
oh, god.

10:47.499 --> 10:49.733
We're all alone.

10:49.735 --> 10:51.936
Everyone's left.

10:51.938 --> 10:53.971
No, they'll come back.

10:55.240 --> 10:57.508
Are you dense? Everyone's left.

10:57.510 --> 10:59.310
The pool's closed
for the holiday weekend.

10:59.312 --> 11:01.946
We're stuck in here.
We're gonna die in here.

11:01.948 --> 11:04.315
We're not gonna die.
Stop freaking out.

11:05.952 --> 11:07.818
Oh.

11:07.820 --> 11:10.721
God, I feel nauseous.

11:10.723 --> 11:12.723
Hey, hey, hey,
calm down, calm down.

11:16.895 --> 11:18.963
Remind me to knock out that
manager when we get out of here.

11:18.965 --> 11:21.232
This is horseshit.

11:21.234 --> 11:24.268
Oh, my god, that bastard
did it on purpose.

11:24.270 --> 11:28.472
Shit! I cannot believe
this is happening!

11:28.474 --> 11:31.008
- Help! Somebody, help us!
- Hey, hey, hey. Jonna.

11:31.010 --> 11:33.277
- Jonna, come on, come on!
- God!

11:33.279 --> 11:35.980
It's too solid.
We can't break it.

11:35.982 --> 11:38.716
Oh. Oh.

11:38.718 --> 11:40.384
We can, we can go
to the shallow end

11:40.386 --> 11:41.785
and just try and push it up
from there, alright?

11:41.787 --> 11:43.020
I don't know if it'll work

11:43.022 --> 11:45.623
but we have to try
something, okay?

11:45.625 --> 11:48.325
Yeah. Yeah, okay, let's go.

12:01.906 --> 12:03.741
'On three.'

12:03.743 --> 12:06.577
one, two, three!

12:09.582 --> 12:11.315
Useless!

12:12.684 --> 12:15.519
We had to try.
I needed to see how solid it is.

12:15.521 --> 12:18.656
Solid? It's made
of freakin' fiberglass.

12:18.658 --> 12:20.391
Listen, we need to figure out
our options here.

12:20.393 --> 12:21.992
Are you serious?

12:21.994 --> 12:24.428
You're going to treat this like
one of your corporate projects?

12:24.430 --> 12:27.598
Do I get a review after?
Can I be the team leader?

12:27.600 --> 12:30.501
What would you rather do?
Scream your head off some more?

12:30.503 --> 12:32.536
Fine. What now?

12:33.838 --> 12:35.339
We need to check
all the seals and edges.

12:35.341 --> 12:37.741
Maybe there's a weak spot
somewhere.

12:37.743 --> 12:40.577
- Yeah?
- Yeah, okay. Let's do it.

13:11.710 --> 13:13.711
Yuck, gross.

13:38.069 --> 13:40.404
'Hey, I found something.'

13:42.807 --> 13:44.675
it's a hole.

13:48.947 --> 13:50.814
It's thick. We need something

13:50.816 --> 13:52.516
to push through,
so we can widen it.

13:52.518 --> 13:54.017
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah,
okay, I'll just go

13:54.019 --> 13:56.053
and grab my tool belt.

13:56.055 --> 13:58.122
Get out of the way.

13:58.124 --> 14:00.657
'Piece of shit!'

14:00.659 --> 14:02.960
'come on! Ugh!'

14:05.164 --> 14:06.697
real productive.

14:06.699 --> 14:08.766
Why is there a hole, anyway?
A peephole?

14:08.768 --> 14:10.667
Condensation hole or air duct,
I don't know.

14:10.669 --> 14:13.537
Or maybe so people
don't get stuck?

14:13.539 --> 14:14.972
Idiots.

14:16.074 --> 14:18.175
Like I said, we need something.

14:18.177 --> 14:20.444
I can't believe
this is happening.

14:20.446 --> 14:23.947
Hey, just keep looking. Come on.

15:26.077 --> 15:27.578
Well?

15:30.615 --> 15:31.849
No use.

15:31.851 --> 15:36.086
Just let me rest.
Think for a sec.

15:36.088 --> 15:38.021
What do you think the worst way
to die would be?

15:38.023 --> 15:39.890
'Quit being morbid.'

15:39.892 --> 15:41.492
starvation?

15:42.861 --> 15:45.262
- Drowning?
- Stop.

15:45.264 --> 15:46.864
Sharks?

15:46.866 --> 15:48.565
Probably being eaten alive
by sharks.

15:48.567 --> 15:50.901
I mean, that's all
we're missing, right?

15:50.903 --> 15:53.837
- David.
- What about him?

15:55.974 --> 15:58.008
He proposed.
I was gonna tell you.

15:59.711 --> 16:01.178
He'll figure this out.
He'll call the police

16:01.180 --> 16:03.614
when he notices I'm gone.

16:03.616 --> 16:05.582
It's been more
than an hour, Bree.

16:05.584 --> 16:08.285
We just have to wait.

16:08.287 --> 16:10.654
Right. Okay, yeah, alright.

16:10.656 --> 16:14.892
I mean, let's just, uh

16:14.894 --> 16:18.095
kick back and relax
and, uh, and wait

16:18.097 --> 16:20.831
for your knight
in shining armor to ride in

16:20.833 --> 16:23.967
on his, on his white horse
and rescue us.

16:23.969 --> 16:26.236
What is wrong with you?

16:26.238 --> 16:28.238
Nothing. Nothing at all.

16:32.877 --> 16:35.679
This isn't my fault, you know?

16:35.681 --> 16:37.748
Right, 'cause you're perfect.

16:40.218 --> 16:42.219
Is that what this is about?

16:43.721 --> 16:46.023
Do you think
rehab was easy for me?

16:46.025 --> 16:48.625
Going through that
all over again?

16:48.627 --> 16:51.028
- Jonna...
- Know what the worst part was?

16:53.965 --> 16:57.868
It was coming home
to find you not there.

16:59.037 --> 17:01.305
It sucked.

17:01.307 --> 17:03.674
I'm sorry.

17:03.676 --> 17:05.909
It's just
I have my own life now.

17:07.779 --> 17:10.247
Can't you take care of yourself?

17:10.249 --> 17:13.584
- Apparently, I can't.
- That's not what I meant.

17:13.586 --> 17:15.218
No?

17:15.220 --> 17:18.121
No, did you just mean
to, to rub it in a bit?

17:18.123 --> 17:21.191
Just a little, you know,
brag about your..

17:21.193 --> 17:23.794
Your giant diamond ring.

17:23.796 --> 17:26.930
Tell me about how wonderful
your life is with David.

17:26.932 --> 17:29.032
You've always been like that.

17:32.036 --> 17:34.204
You did it, didn't you?

17:34.206 --> 17:37.074
You saw the ring in my bag
and you threw it in the water.

17:37.076 --> 17:40.777
How could you, jonna?
Look what you've done to us!

17:40.779 --> 17:42.112
Jesus!

18:21.352 --> 18:23.286
Come on.

18:25.957 --> 18:28.859
Ow! Shit!

18:33.731 --> 18:35.232
Are you okay?

18:37.135 --> 18:40.270
- Yeah, I'll survive.
- 'We can't keep fighting.'

18:40.272 --> 18:42.339
we need to work together
and figure a way out.

18:42.341 --> 18:45.409
Yeah, like that's possible.

18:45.411 --> 18:47.277
The grate at the bottom,
I think it might be loose.

18:47.279 --> 18:49.980
- Maybe we can pull it off.
- Yeah, and then?

18:49.982 --> 18:52.182
It's heavy.

18:52.184 --> 18:53.417
It might be able
to break the cover

18:53.419 --> 18:55.385
if we can find the right spot.

18:55.387 --> 18:58.955
Okay, great, Bree. Why don't
you try and pry it off then?

18:58.957 --> 19:01.224
I did. It won't budge.
I'm not strong enough.

19:02.994 --> 19:04.728
And what? You think I am?

19:04.730 --> 19:07.998
Well, if we tried together
or, or we take turns.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.800
Sounds crazy.

19:09.802 --> 19:12.703
Look, if you're still scared
of getting your hair stuck...

19:12.705 --> 19:15.972
I'm not scared, okay?

19:15.974 --> 19:18.075
It just sounds pointless.

19:19.711 --> 19:22.345
You have another idea?

19:25.850 --> 19:27.250
Was that..

19:28.820 --> 19:30.387
It came from outside the pool.

19:30.389 --> 19:32.389
By the bleachers.

19:42.233 --> 19:45.001
- It's David. It has to be.
- Lot a help that does us.

19:45.003 --> 19:46.269
'Maybe we can get to it.'

19:53.144 --> 19:54.811
here. Another air duct.

19:54.813 --> 19:56.480
If we could just make it
big enough to get to the...

19:56.482 --> 19:59.149
We already tried that, MacGyver.

19:59.151 --> 20:01.885
Can you just think
one positive thing, please?

20:01.887 --> 20:04.788
Yeah, okay, sure,
I'm positive this truly sucks.

20:06.124 --> 20:07.524
Yeah, hey, it's me again.

20:07.526 --> 20:09.359
Yeah, don't forget
I have that dinner tonight

20:09.361 --> 20:11.895
so, uh, don't wait up.

20:11.897 --> 20:14.030
Talk to you when I get home,
okay? Love you.

20:14.032 --> 20:15.766
Yeah, bye.

20:22.140 --> 20:25.075
- What are you doing now?
- 'Something useful.'

20:25.077 --> 20:27.410
damn it!

20:58.176 --> 21:00.377
Told you it was a stupid idea.

21:02.446 --> 21:05.148
This whole day
has been a stupid idea.

21:05.150 --> 21:07.951
Right. Who'd wanna hang out
with a screw-up like me, right?

21:11.055 --> 21:12.823
Maybe you're right.

21:34.312 --> 21:36.313
How long before
he starts to worry?

21:39.050 --> 21:40.550
No idea.

21:42.153 --> 21:43.453
Great.

21:47.058 --> 21:49.259
What just happened?

21:49.261 --> 21:51.461
Must be on a timer.

21:51.463 --> 21:52.896
Oh.

21:54.565 --> 21:57.634
You got to be kidding me.
Come on!

22:09.047 --> 22:10.914
He keeps calling.

22:13.184 --> 22:15.518
He's gonna get worried.
He has to.

22:15.520 --> 22:18.054
Yeah, and then what?

22:18.056 --> 22:19.456
I don't know.

22:21.158 --> 22:22.626
Nobody knows
we're down here, Bree

22:22.628 --> 22:25.962
and when they find out,
it's gonna be too late.

22:25.964 --> 22:29.099
Can we not argue about this
for, like, the 100th time?

22:32.303 --> 22:35.071
I never liked him.

22:35.073 --> 22:37.641
I don't understand why you
would agree to marry that chump.

22:37.643 --> 22:39.309
You're so much better than him.

22:39.311 --> 22:41.478
Don't get started on David.

22:41.480 --> 22:43.079
'It's so typical of you.'

22:43.081 --> 22:44.614
you get in a hard spot
and you start digging

22:44.616 --> 22:47.317
at everyone around you
until you strike a nerve.

22:47.319 --> 22:49.185
I've had enough.

23:04.135 --> 23:06.569
What is it?

23:06.571 --> 23:08.171
A headache.

23:12.677 --> 23:14.377
You can't lie to me.

23:14.379 --> 23:17.013
'Your eyes are bugging out.
You can barely stand.'

23:19.350 --> 23:21.718
my blood sugar's low.

23:21.720 --> 23:24.354
- 'I'm diabetic.'
- What?

23:26.490 --> 23:29.459
'I need my shot.'

23:29.461 --> 23:31.261
it's in my purse.

23:32.463 --> 23:35.365
You're making this up, right?

23:35.367 --> 23:36.700
Why would I?

23:36.702 --> 23:39.369
I don't know. Sympathy?

23:39.371 --> 23:41.037
That's a page out of your book.

23:41.039 --> 23:42.472
Not everybody thinks
the way you do.

23:42.474 --> 23:45.275
Oh, come on. Don't fuck with me.
That's not funny.

23:49.146 --> 23:52.215
I'm not.
I was diagnosed three years ago.

23:54.518 --> 23:56.052
Jesus.

23:58.322 --> 24:00.557
Why, why didn't you t-tell me?

24:03.094 --> 24:04.995
Would it have mattered?

24:09.100 --> 24:11.634
I'm not a doctor, Bree.
What does this mean?

24:11.636 --> 24:14.004
It means I need my shot soon.

24:14.006 --> 24:16.239
Or?

24:16.241 --> 24:19.509
- I could fall into a coma.
- Oh, Jesus.

24:25.783 --> 24:28.051
Okay.

24:28.053 --> 24:31.187
We're gonna get you
your shot, okay?

25:05.122 --> 25:06.689
'Let me see.'

25:17.301 --> 25:19.302
does it ever hurt?

25:20.337 --> 25:23.206
I don't feel anything, actually.

25:23.208 --> 25:25.241
It's like I'm dead there.

25:30.481 --> 25:33.216
We never talked about it.

25:33.218 --> 25:35.251
What's to talk about?

25:35.253 --> 25:36.820
Are you serious?

25:38.789 --> 25:42.158
I didn't see it like you did.

25:43.527 --> 25:46.296
'I only remember it
after it was over.'

25:46.298 --> 25:49.566
- don't.
- That smell.

25:49.568 --> 25:51.201
It's like it never went away,

25:51.203 --> 25:53.203
you know,
I still smell it sometimes.

25:53.205 --> 25:55.538
Just stop.

25:55.540 --> 25:58.641
I wish I never looked in there.

25:58.643 --> 26:01.444
God, his skin, it was all black

26:01.446 --> 26:03.179
and flaking off like paper.

26:03.181 --> 26:05.148
Why are you still talking
about this?

26:05.150 --> 26:07.450
I had a counselor
in rehab, Margaret.

26:07.452 --> 26:10.353
She said I should talk
about this stuff.

26:10.355 --> 26:13.323
She your mother now?

26:13.325 --> 26:15.892
She's kind of a douche,
actually, with terrible teeth

26:15.894 --> 26:18.428
but she's right.

26:18.430 --> 26:20.430
Tell me what happened.

26:25.436 --> 26:26.803
You know what happened.

26:26.805 --> 26:29.572
I know what mom told me
and I pieced together

26:29.574 --> 26:31.474
the bits and pieces
you've told me over the years

26:31.476 --> 26:33.543
but I don't know
the whole story.

26:35.646 --> 26:37.881
Dad was a monster.
Plain and simple.

26:42.553 --> 26:45.655
He came in that night drunk.

26:45.657 --> 26:48.258
You could smell it off him.

26:48.260 --> 26:50.560
'Every time he breathed'

26:50.562 --> 26:54.330
it filled the room with that
rotten stench of whisky.

26:58.169 --> 27:00.603
He lit a cigarette
and just passed out.

27:04.909 --> 27:08.244
He must have fallen
against the pillow because..

27:08.246 --> 27:10.486
'...because you could see
the fire started about there..'

27:12.283 --> 27:15.251
right by his head.

27:15.253 --> 27:17.787
'It started fanning out
like a circle.'

27:17.789 --> 27:19.389
'just burning.'

27:20.925 --> 27:23.293
he didn't scream or anything.

27:23.295 --> 27:24.894
He was so damn drunk
he didn't even notice

27:24.896 --> 27:26.896
he was burning to death.

27:29.400 --> 27:31.834
I pulled at him.
Tried to wake him up.

27:34.338 --> 27:36.606
Here we are.

27:36.608 --> 27:38.641
It must have hurt so bad.

27:41.745 --> 27:43.479
Not until after.

27:45.282 --> 27:46.950
When it was happening, it was..

27:48.652 --> 27:51.554
It was just like ice
sliding over my skin..

27:53.591 --> 27:55.291
Numbing me.

27:57.995 --> 28:00.563
It was like a release.

28:05.469 --> 28:06.836
Oh, my god.

28:06.838 --> 28:08.271
I told you someone would come.

28:08.273 --> 28:09.772
Come on, hurry!

28:43.274 --> 28:45.675
Help! Help, we're in here!

28:45.677 --> 28:48.811
Come on!

28:48.813 --> 28:50.913
- 'Help!'
- 'Help, help us!'

28:53.450 --> 28:55.618
what the hell are you two
doing in there?

28:55.620 --> 28:57.654
We got trapped.
Can you let us out?

28:59.723 --> 29:02.425
Yeah. Hang on a minute.

29:02.427 --> 29:05.328
Oh, my god. Oh, my god!
Thank god you're here!

29:05.330 --> 29:07.964
Oh, my god! We've been
trapped in here for hours.

29:07.966 --> 29:10.433
'My sister's ring got caught
in the drain'

29:10.435 --> 29:12.935
'and we tried to get it out
and that idiot manager'

29:12.937 --> 29:14.804
'closed the top on us.'

29:19.443 --> 29:21.444
it's so crazy that you're here.
I can't believe it!

29:21.446 --> 29:22.745
What's your name?

29:30.754 --> 29:33.790
- I'll be right back.
- Where, where is she going?

29:33.792 --> 29:35.858
Maybe she's just gone to see
how to open the cover.

29:37.828 --> 29:39.629
Okay, yeah, okay.

30:09.626 --> 30:10.993
Never heard of two grown women

30:10.995 --> 30:13.429
getting themselves
stuck in a pool before.

30:14.565 --> 30:16.933
I know. We're idiots, right?

30:16.935 --> 30:20.036
My daughter did something
stupid like this once.

30:20.038 --> 30:21.971
'She got her hand
caught in a drain'

30:21.973 --> 30:25.141
'and I called the plumber
for like 100 bucks'

30:25.143 --> 30:27.643
to come out and take
the whole damn thing apart.

30:29.079 --> 30:31.147
Yeah.

30:31.149 --> 30:33.516
That wasn't even the stupidest
thing she ever did.

30:35.018 --> 30:37.687
- So can you get us out?
- Yeah.

30:37.689 --> 30:39.722
What's your name, honey?

30:39.724 --> 30:42.658
Bree. My sister's jonna.

30:42.660 --> 30:43.960
'What kind of new age names.'

30:43.962 --> 30:46.529
'are, are you even from here?'

30:46.531 --> 30:48.831
uh..

30:48.833 --> 30:50.700
Wh-what's with all
the questions?

30:50.702 --> 30:53.536
Are you, are you
gonna let us out or not?

30:53.538 --> 30:56.939
Be polite. I have your phone
and it's blinkin'.

30:58.008 --> 31:00.143
Looks like it needs a password.

31:04.681 --> 31:06.816
Are you, are you serious?

31:08.519 --> 31:10.453
'Well, it might be important.'

31:10.455 --> 31:14.190
maybe somebody's looking for you
or worried about you.

31:14.192 --> 31:16.759
A-are you helping us?

31:16.761 --> 31:19.562
Yes, I'm helping you.
That's why I need the password.

31:21.131 --> 31:23.633
- Don't do it.
- She could call the police.

31:23.635 --> 31:25.601
'I just wanna get
the hell out of here.'

31:25.603 --> 31:27.737
yeah, okay, fine.

31:27.739 --> 31:29.672
'7397.'

31:34.679 --> 31:36.846
uh, what-what's so funny?

31:36.848 --> 31:40.183
'Well, Bree, you're like
a real cutie pie, huh?'

31:40.185 --> 31:44.220
you and the guy with the wavy,
gravy brown hair.

31:48.492 --> 31:52.094
'There's a lot of missed calls
and texts.'

31:52.096 --> 31:54.230
'i wonder who they're from?'

31:54.232 --> 31:56.599
miss, please,
there's no reason to do this.

31:59.636 --> 32:01.838
There's always a reason
for everything.

32:03.874 --> 32:05.541
'Yeah, hey, it's me again.'

32:05.543 --> 32:07.009
'yeah, don't forget
I have that dinner tonight'

32:07.011 --> 32:09.579
'so, uh, don't wait up.'

32:09.581 --> 32:12.482
'talk to you when I get home,
okay? Love you.'

32:12.484 --> 32:14.016
'babe, where are you?'

32:14.018 --> 32:17.787
'did your psycho sister
kidnap you or something?'

32:17.789 --> 32:19.856
'alright, call me, love you.'

32:19.858 --> 32:22.492
'wow! Somebody's got drama.'

32:22.494 --> 32:24.026
can you, please,
just call him back?

32:24.028 --> 32:27.163
Quit being such a bitch!
Why are you doing this?

32:27.165 --> 32:28.531
'Come on!'

32:28.533 --> 32:31.734
wow. What a mouth on you.

32:31.736 --> 32:34.070
No wonder why David thinks
you're a psycho.

32:34.072 --> 32:37.073
'Let's see if your sister
has any pictures of you.'

32:37.075 --> 32:41.544
'oh, yeah, I bet that's you
in the tattoo, isn't it?'

32:41.546 --> 32:43.846
I bet that's not even
your only one, is it?

32:43.848 --> 32:46.849
Do you have a tramp stamp,
jonna?

32:46.851 --> 32:49.151
Give the lucky boys
something to look at?

32:49.153 --> 32:50.786
What is she doing?

32:50.788 --> 32:52.989
I'm gonna kick
the living shit out of you!

32:52.991 --> 32:56.092
Come on! What are you doing?
It's not funny!

32:56.094 --> 32:58.928
'Simmer down. I don't think
you're gonna be doing anything.'

33:00.898 --> 33:02.231
'here's the thing.'

33:04.034 --> 33:06.903
it's really tough
in the real world, you know.

33:06.905 --> 33:09.272
And I just got out of lockup,
like, nine months ago

33:09.274 --> 33:11.107
'and I, I can't get a real job'

33:11.109 --> 33:14.544
'and, and even this stupid crap
job cut me back to part-time'

33:14.546 --> 33:16.646
and that's why
I'm so behind on rent.

33:16.648 --> 33:18.814
I..

33:18.816 --> 33:21.717
All these stupid bills, I..

33:24.755 --> 33:26.722
What does that mean?

33:26.724 --> 33:28.257
'It means
this is an opportunity.'

33:28.259 --> 33:30.860
'and if you see one
and you don't take it'

33:30.862 --> 33:32.728
'then you're stupid.'

33:32.730 --> 33:37.066
so I'm gonna need your pin code
for your bank card, Bree.

33:37.068 --> 33:39.268
'God, you crazy bitch!'

33:39.270 --> 33:42.638
yeah, an attitude like that

33:42.640 --> 33:45.341
is probably what got you here
in the first place.

33:45.343 --> 33:47.944
Look, I'm sure
we can figure this out.

33:47.946 --> 33:50.613
Just, just promise
you'll let us out of here.

33:50.615 --> 33:52.682
Nope.

33:52.684 --> 33:55.251
I'm not promising you nothing
until you give me the code.

33:55.253 --> 33:57.587
'Don't do it.'

33:57.589 --> 33:59.121
'don't do it.'

34:05.128 --> 34:06.629
'well?'

34:08.799 --> 34:10.833
what's it gonna be?

34:15.172 --> 34:16.772
Stubborn.

34:22.746 --> 34:25.114
Things never end well
for stubborn girls.

34:32.789 --> 34:34.757
Great.

34:34.759 --> 34:37.092
Where did she go?

34:37.094 --> 34:38.828
'To hell, I hope.'

34:38.830 --> 34:40.862
we have to cooperate.

34:40.864 --> 34:42.764
No, we don't have
to do anything.

34:42.766 --> 34:44.699
You act like we have
a choice here.

34:44.702 --> 34:46.002
She's blackmailing us.

34:46.004 --> 34:48.004
Do you have any other ideas?

34:52.042 --> 34:53.775
We've waited it out
this long, okay?

34:53.777 --> 34:55.777
What's few more hours?

34:55.780 --> 34:57.780
Jonna, I don't think I can.

35:12.195 --> 35:14.897
'You know, I used to be
just like you girls.'

35:14.899 --> 35:16.966
'i was a fashion snob too.'

35:18.769 --> 35:22.271
'yep, buying fancy outfits
to relax at the pool.'

35:23.974 --> 35:25.775
just like you.

35:29.046 --> 35:31.914
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

35:33.450 --> 35:34.984
'I did nothing.'

35:34.986 --> 35:37.319
but you know, I hope you know

35:37.321 --> 35:40.056
it does get real nippy
here at night, you know.

35:40.058 --> 35:44.193
The whole, like, desert air,
it's, it's chilly.

35:44.195 --> 35:46.429
'It could, like, cut you
right to the bone.'

35:46.431 --> 35:50.433
do you have any idea
how much trouble you're in?

35:50.435 --> 35:53.402
I'm fine, actually.
I'm a little worried about you

35:53.404 --> 35:56.739
'cause you really seem like the
string-bikini type, aren't you?

35:56.741 --> 35:59.208
What the hell is this freakshow
talking about?

36:02.079 --> 36:04.180
The heater. She turned it off.

36:06.016 --> 36:07.416
This isn't a joke!

36:07.418 --> 36:10.086
You're going to kill us,
do you understand?

36:11.755 --> 36:14.457
Yeah, I never said it was.

36:14.459 --> 36:16.959
But unless you think
you can get through the night

36:16.961 --> 36:19.895
without freezing,
I suggest you hand over

36:19.897 --> 36:22.131
the pin code for your atm.

36:25.135 --> 36:27.803
Just promise
you'll let us out of here.

36:30.273 --> 36:33.242
I swear on my father's grave.

36:33.244 --> 36:35.144
God, she's lying!

36:37.481 --> 36:40.483
- We don't have a choice.
- There's always a choice.

36:51.261 --> 36:53.162
'It's 6530.'

36:57.934 --> 37:00.302
see, that wasn't so bad.

37:00.304 --> 37:04.106
I swear to god, lady,
if you're lying to us..

37:04.108 --> 37:05.975
'Stay as warm
as you can in there.'

37:05.977 --> 37:07.810
oh, come on,
you have to come back.

37:07.812 --> 37:10.479
You're gonna kill us!

37:10.481 --> 37:12.548
She'll be back. She has to.

37:14.217 --> 37:17.086
Oh, god. I swear to god,
when I get my hands on her..

37:19.489 --> 37:21.891
Hey, hey. Just come here.

37:21.893 --> 37:23.292
- 'Come here.'
- I'm gonna kill her.

37:23.294 --> 37:24.927
Just hold on.

37:45.081 --> 37:47.483
'It's so quiet.'

37:51.354 --> 37:52.521
peaceful.

37:54.559 --> 37:57.059
No wonder we used to come here
when we were kids.

38:05.435 --> 38:06.969
Bree.

38:08.905 --> 38:10.406
Bree.

38:10.408 --> 38:12.842
I'm here.

38:12.844 --> 38:14.844
Just hang in there, okay?

38:16.913 --> 38:18.981
Has she come back?

38:24.120 --> 38:25.454
She will.

38:27.557 --> 38:29.625
I don't trust her.

38:32.362 --> 38:35.497
When do you trust anyone?

38:35.499 --> 38:38.234
I'm really not in the mood
for a lecture, okay?

38:38.236 --> 38:40.236
I don't have the energy
to give one.

38:49.246 --> 38:52.314
We can't just sit here
and freeze to death.

38:52.316 --> 38:54.316
We tried everything.

38:58.455 --> 38:59.655
'No.'

39:01.291 --> 39:03.659
the filter grate,
I never tried it.

39:05.662 --> 39:07.663
Maybe I can get it off.

39:09.466 --> 39:12.201
You'll be okay if I leave you
for, like, two minutes?

39:12.203 --> 39:13.636
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

39:16.539 --> 39:18.407
Don't go anywhere.

39:21.678 --> 39:24.079
Just stay there.

40:12.629 --> 40:14.096
Bree?

40:16.199 --> 40:17.533
Bree!

40:21.438 --> 40:22.638
Bree.

40:22.640 --> 40:24.440
Come on, Bree, wake up, wake up.

40:24.442 --> 40:27.142
Wake up, come on!

40:27.144 --> 40:28.510
Oh, god, you scared
the crap out of me.

40:28.512 --> 40:30.646
Are you okay?

40:30.648 --> 40:32.414
Did you get it?

40:34.250 --> 40:35.651
'I couldn't.'

40:37.587 --> 40:38.988
I'm useless.

40:40.523 --> 40:42.057
You tried.

40:43.593 --> 40:45.060
'No.'

40:46.396 --> 40:48.530
I'm a coward.

40:48.532 --> 40:50.199
Don't say that.

40:54.304 --> 40:56.305
God, this is all my fault.

40:58.208 --> 41:00.409
God, I wish
I could take it back.

41:01.644 --> 41:03.645
'Hey. Jonna, hey.'

41:04.681 --> 41:06.682
we can't lose hope.

41:12.055 --> 41:13.756
I wish I was more like you.

41:15.291 --> 41:16.625
Hey.

41:18.194 --> 41:19.528
You are.

41:21.731 --> 41:23.699
You just don't believe it.

41:44.187 --> 41:46.155
You're wasting energy.

41:47.357 --> 41:48.690
I need to move.

41:48.692 --> 41:51.126
It's the only thing
that keeps me warm.

41:54.597 --> 41:56.698
So this counselor in rehab..

41:58.468 --> 41:59.802
'...did she ever talk
about what happened?'

41:59.804 --> 42:02.171
stop.

42:02.173 --> 42:04.440
I thought we were supposed
to talk about these things.

42:04.442 --> 42:07.142
We're supposed to talk about it
doesn't mean that I want to.

42:09.479 --> 42:13.582
Yeah, you mean only
when it's convenient for you.

42:13.584 --> 42:15.517
Yeah, sure, whatever.

42:20.557 --> 42:22.591
What are you really afraid of?

42:22.593 --> 42:24.259
I don't know.

42:25.762 --> 42:27.596
Yeah, you do.

42:31.634 --> 42:33.569
You really wanna know?

42:35.171 --> 42:36.572
Yeah.

42:38.675 --> 42:40.309
Monsters.

42:45.281 --> 42:47.483
They're everywhere.

42:47.485 --> 42:49.485
So what?

42:49.487 --> 42:51.820
'Suicide's the answer.'

42:51.822 --> 42:54.723
you don't know what it's like.

42:54.725 --> 42:57.626
It's like I have this..

42:57.628 --> 43:00.696
Giant, black..

43:02.832 --> 43:04.867
'...ugly thing inside me.'

43:07.637 --> 43:10.239
rumbling, just eating at me.

43:13.776 --> 43:15.878
You don't have
to be afraid anymore.

43:17.814 --> 43:19.681
'It's in the past.'

43:22.752 --> 43:26.588
yeah, well, you gotta stop
eating Chinese food, okay?

43:26.590 --> 43:29.258
All those, those fortune cookies
are rotting your brain.

43:36.566 --> 43:38.901
All those things dad did to us.

43:41.404 --> 43:43.572
I'm sorry it lasted so long.

43:46.242 --> 43:48.777
Hey, if he didn't die, it would
have kept going forever, so..

43:51.381 --> 43:53.315
It didn't.

43:53.317 --> 43:55.651
He's still in my head.

43:58.454 --> 44:00.923
All the time.

44:00.925 --> 44:02.791
It gets better.

44:05.728 --> 44:07.296
'He's gone.'

44:07.298 --> 44:09.331
keep reminding yourself that.

44:21.477 --> 44:23.879
What the..

44:23.881 --> 44:26.949
'How long have you
been there for?'

44:26.951 --> 44:28.650
a while now.

44:28.652 --> 44:31.220
Sounds like you girls have been
through some stuff.

44:32.589 --> 44:34.823
You think
that makes you special?

44:34.825 --> 44:36.425
'Alright, so you, you got
what you wanted.'

44:36.427 --> 44:38.694
you gonna let us out
of here or not?

44:38.696 --> 44:39.995
Yeah, maybe
you should have mentioned

44:39.997 --> 44:42.497
you only had 80 bucks
in your account.

44:42.499 --> 44:44.933
'A lot of good
that's gonna do me.'

44:44.935 --> 44:47.269
god, are you joking?

44:49.439 --> 44:51.840
You swore
on your father's grave!

44:54.611 --> 44:55.844
'Listen.'

44:57.647 --> 45:00.015
my sister's really not
doing so well.

45:00.017 --> 45:02.918
'She needs her shot.
It's in her purse.'

45:02.920 --> 45:05.320
'she's diabetic,
do you understand?'

45:06.956 --> 45:09.925
- 'she could die.'
- Yeah, right.

45:09.927 --> 45:13.028
You will say anything
to get out of there right now.

45:13.030 --> 45:15.831
I'm not lying. I'm serious.

45:15.833 --> 45:18.300
Come on. You don't want blood
on your hands, do you?

45:18.302 --> 45:19.534
Oh, boo-hoo. Shut up.

45:19.536 --> 45:20.969
I'm borderline diabetic

45:20.971 --> 45:24.006
and my doctor says
I don't even need anything.

45:24.008 --> 45:27.042
So maybe that's just
for lazy people.

45:27.044 --> 45:29.811
I have a different kind.

45:29.813 --> 45:31.813
'Can you just let us out,
please?'

45:31.815 --> 45:33.682
you know, I don't really see why

45:33.684 --> 45:37.052
I'm expected to do you
any favors.

45:37.054 --> 45:40.656
I mean, this whole thing
just pisses me off, you know.

45:40.658 --> 45:43.425
You put me in this position
'cause you're so stupid.

45:43.427 --> 45:45.661
This is not our fault.

45:45.663 --> 45:49.064
- 'Don't give me that crap.'
- What do you want?

45:50.967 --> 45:54.436
The world doesn't
owe you any favors

45:54.438 --> 45:56.571
and neither do I.

45:56.573 --> 46:01.510
Come on, just open this cover
and let us out!

46:03.514 --> 46:06.615
You know what, come here.
Come over here.

46:13.790 --> 46:16.458
'Can you hear me?'

46:16.460 --> 46:18.860
I might just leave you
both in there to die.

46:56.132 --> 46:58.867
She's insane.

46:58.869 --> 47:01.103
I told you she was.

47:01.105 --> 47:03.672
We can't reason
with someone like this.

47:03.674 --> 47:05.741
We need to figure out
another way.

47:16.119 --> 47:18.153
What are you doing?

47:24.927 --> 47:27.095
It's a little surprise.

47:36.906 --> 47:39.074
I really don't think
this is a good idea.

47:41.878 --> 47:44.079
Just trust me for once.

48:11.140 --> 48:13.208
I'm so sorry.

48:14.877 --> 48:16.945
'I don't know what to do.'

48:20.049 --> 48:23.652
well, I told you, girls,
everything happens for a reason.

48:23.654 --> 48:25.587
'I really need to tell
you something, okay'

48:25.589 --> 48:26.922
'but I don't want
my sister to hear.'

48:26.924 --> 48:28.924
it can only be you, okay?

48:30.526 --> 48:31.827
Go ahead.

48:31.829 --> 48:34.496
I, I..

48:36.232 --> 48:39.167
Yeah. Okay. Come on.

48:43.073 --> 48:44.840
I-I-i can't even hear you.

48:54.951 --> 48:56.485
Go fuck yourself!

49:14.136 --> 49:16.671
I got her!

49:16.673 --> 49:18.273
I got her!

49:35.992 --> 49:37.726
Stupid girl.

49:45.902 --> 49:48.904
You don't listen to me,
you don't listen.

49:48.906 --> 49:51.940
'You never listen to me.
You wanna ignore me?'

49:51.942 --> 49:54.209
serves you right.

49:54.211 --> 49:55.844
You think this is funny?

49:55.846 --> 49:57.112
You got what you've deserved.

49:57.114 --> 49:59.114
Now you're gonna let us
out of here!

49:59.116 --> 50:03.084
You are messing
with the wrong woman.

50:03.086 --> 50:05.854
'And I'm sorry, Bree, but I'm
sure this ain't the first time'

50:05.856 --> 50:08.290
'you're gonna get punished
for something your sister did.'

50:13.262 --> 50:17.165
well, this is for you.

50:29.579 --> 50:31.980
- You smell that?
- Chlorine.

50:40.756 --> 50:42.257
Shoot.

50:43.893 --> 50:46.194
It must be the cleaning system.

50:49.632 --> 50:51.266
Block the jets!

50:59.976 --> 51:01.042
Oh!

51:27.804 --> 51:30.739
You have anything
you wanna say to me now?

52:07.410 --> 52:10.111
You had enough yet, girls?

52:13.883 --> 52:15.050
The hole.

52:15.951 --> 52:17.385
The hole.

52:25.695 --> 52:27.062
Let us out!

52:27.064 --> 52:29.330
What's that?
I can't really hear you.

52:30.466 --> 52:33.968
Come on, please.

52:33.970 --> 52:36.271
It's, you're killing us!

52:36.273 --> 52:39.908
Please!

53:10.206 --> 53:12.173
I can flip that switch
at any time, ladies.

53:12.175 --> 53:14.909
You understand? You hear me?

53:16.278 --> 53:17.812
Yes.

53:17.814 --> 53:19.481
Speak up.

53:19.483 --> 53:22.751
'We understand.
Can you please just let us out?'

53:24.453 --> 53:27.789
I'm the one in control here now.

53:27.791 --> 53:29.891
We're sorry.

53:29.893 --> 53:34.763
And all these life lessons,
they're not free.

53:34.765 --> 53:36.464
'You have something I want.'

53:36.466 --> 53:39.768
you already have everything.

53:39.770 --> 53:43.171
You, you have my phone,
my purse.

53:43.173 --> 53:45.173
'What else do you want?'

53:46.342 --> 53:48.343
I want that ring.

53:50.379 --> 53:53.248
No, that's her engagement ring.
She's getting married.

53:53.250 --> 53:56.284
Let me tell you
something about marriage.

53:56.286 --> 53:58.286
It's overrated.

53:58.288 --> 54:00.321
That's not right.

54:00.323 --> 54:03.391
You're gonna thank me
in a couple of years. Trust me.

54:03.393 --> 54:07.395
I am, I am honestly,
I am begging you. Please!

54:07.397 --> 54:10.165
Oh, you can't throw into it.
Bree, please.

54:10.167 --> 54:13.034
Please, I'm begging you.
I'm begging you, Bree.

54:13.036 --> 54:15.170
I just wanna go home.

54:18.507 --> 54:20.074
Bree.

54:35.591 --> 54:38.226
'Pawn shop will give me
something decent for this.'

54:41.163 --> 54:44.065
I'm sure you feel pretty low,
but trust me

54:44.067 --> 54:46.334
there's always somebody
lower than you.

54:46.336 --> 54:49.204
Can you let us out now?

54:49.206 --> 54:51.339
I'll let you out
when I'm good and ready.

54:54.977 --> 54:56.945
I'm so sorry.

54:58.514 --> 55:00.849
I don't wanna talk.

55:03.152 --> 55:04.552
Bree.

55:07.189 --> 55:09.257
I just wanna be alone.

56:11.388 --> 56:12.987
Jonna!

56:14.290 --> 56:15.623
Is that you?

56:35.445 --> 56:37.345
Miss, is that you?

56:40.350 --> 56:44.052
It's people. It's-it's people.

56:44.054 --> 56:45.553
People..

56:48.257 --> 56:50.291
Here! We're in here!

56:57.099 --> 56:59.567
Baby, it's, it's okay.

57:01.036 --> 57:02.570
'You're safe.'

57:10.679 --> 57:13.481
it's okay.

57:13.483 --> 57:15.283
You're safe, baby.

57:17.119 --> 57:19.020
Where's jonna?

57:24.526 --> 57:26.694
Baby, you can't leave her.

57:26.696 --> 57:28.496
I'm so tired.

57:28.498 --> 57:30.298
She needs you.

57:32.334 --> 57:36.604
I can't, I can't do it.

57:40.109 --> 57:41.442
Jonna.

57:48.751 --> 57:50.284
Jonna?

58:01.063 --> 58:03.064
What are you doing?

58:05.034 --> 58:07.268
Just leave it alone.

58:07.270 --> 58:09.637
Jonna, you can't
break on me now.

58:11.306 --> 58:13.274
We're gonna survive this.

58:16.078 --> 58:18.780
What if we do?

58:18.782 --> 58:22.617
You survive this
and you, you have David.

58:22.619 --> 58:27.121
You have your life
to go back to, okay?

58:27.123 --> 58:29.490
There's nothing out there
for me.

58:31.493 --> 58:34.195
I die
and no one will even notice.

58:35.798 --> 58:39.233
It'll be a relief for you
and for mom and for everyone.

58:39.235 --> 58:42.070
That's not true.

58:42.072 --> 58:44.072
That is not true.

58:46.108 --> 58:49.444
I need you here, please.

58:49.446 --> 58:53.081
Oh, Bree, I don't want you
to have to carry me anymore.

58:54.850 --> 58:57.685
Jonna, we're sisters.
We carry each other.

58:59.188 --> 59:00.755
Oh, fuck.

59:00.757 --> 59:02.757
You'd really just leave me here?

59:02.759 --> 59:04.492
No.

59:04.494 --> 59:07.161
You kill yourself,
you kill both of us

59:07.163 --> 59:09.097
and I'm not ready to die.

59:09.099 --> 59:11.432
And neither are you.

59:11.434 --> 59:13.634
I wanna hear you say
you're gonna make it.

59:15.671 --> 59:17.738
Jonna, I wanna hear you say it.

59:18.774 --> 59:20.441
Okay.

59:21.877 --> 59:23.845
I'm gonna make it.

59:26.181 --> 59:28.316
Bree, I'm gonna make it.

59:29.751 --> 59:31.752
I'm so sorry.

59:31.754 --> 59:33.488
You don't have to feel sorry.

59:33.490 --> 59:37.125
- I'm so sorry.
- No, it's not your fault.

59:37.127 --> 59:39.627
I'm so sorry for everything.

01:00:13.328 --> 01:00:16.230
'Babe, where are you?
It's late. I just got home.'

01:00:16.232 --> 01:00:17.532
'you should have been
back hours ago.'

01:00:17.534 --> 01:00:20.301
'i called jonna, your mom.'

01:00:20.303 --> 01:00:22.170
'where are you?'

01:00:23.906 --> 01:00:26.174
'Bree, I'm calling the cops.
This isn't like you.'

01:00:26.176 --> 01:00:28.209
'if you get this,
call me back right away.'

01:00:28.211 --> 01:00:30.912
'if I don't hear back in five,
I'm dialing 911.'

01:00:30.914 --> 01:00:32.780
'okay, I'm serious.'

01:00:34.550 --> 01:00:35.850
'Bree.'

01:00:52.267 --> 01:00:55.903
god, when we get out of here

01:00:55.905 --> 01:00:59.874
I'm gonna eat
the entire Thanksgiving Turkey

01:00:59.876 --> 01:01:01.609
all by myself.

01:01:03.445 --> 01:01:05.580
Well, here, give me your hand.

01:01:08.850 --> 01:01:10.484
We need to figure out
what to say to her

01:01:10.486 --> 01:01:12.954
when she comes back.

01:01:12.956 --> 01:01:14.922
Well, if she comes back.

01:01:14.924 --> 01:01:16.257
She will.

01:01:16.259 --> 01:01:17.692
People like her
need people like us

01:01:17.694 --> 01:01:20.361
to feel good about themselves.

01:01:20.363 --> 01:01:22.997
Yeah, like a psycho version
of nurse ratched.

01:01:26.535 --> 01:01:29.971
When she comes back,
you follow my lead, alright?

01:01:29.973 --> 01:01:31.872
I will. I promise.

01:01:35.544 --> 01:01:36.711
Miss?

01:01:38.647 --> 01:01:40.248
Yeah, it's me.

01:01:43.819 --> 01:01:45.753
Thank you for coming back.

01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:51.592
I'm not one of those monsters
you keep talking about.

01:01:51.594 --> 01:01:54.328
No, you're not.
We know that now.

01:01:54.330 --> 01:01:56.497
- 'Really?'
- Yeah.

01:01:56.499 --> 01:01:59.300
'We've had a long time to talk
since we've been down here.'

01:02:01.603 --> 01:02:03.571
'we get it now.'

01:02:05.574 --> 01:02:06.907
at first, it seemed
like an accident

01:02:06.909 --> 01:02:09.877
but we know
it happened for a reason.

01:02:12.547 --> 01:02:14.615
Go on.

01:02:14.617 --> 01:02:16.484
'There are a lot of things
we've done in our lives'

01:02:16.486 --> 01:02:18.986
that were, that were wrong.

01:02:23.425 --> 01:02:24.959
Right, jonna?

01:02:26.728 --> 01:02:28.062
Right.

01:02:29.998 --> 01:02:33.067
Being down here has given us
a lot of time to think.

01:02:36.405 --> 01:02:38.472
'And when you let us out
of here, we're gonna change'

01:02:38.474 --> 01:02:40.975
a lot of things, we promise.

01:02:43.845 --> 01:02:45.913
'I'm really sorry
for everything.'

01:02:52.054 --> 01:02:54.789
you know, I used to be
just like you.

01:02:54.791 --> 01:02:56.757
I used to have everything.

01:02:59.361 --> 01:03:01.762
And then it can all go away
in, like, one second.

01:03:04.733 --> 01:03:06.667
So you better appreciate
each other.

01:03:10.672 --> 01:03:12.039
We do.

01:03:14.576 --> 01:03:16.077
I'm gonna hit the code now.

01:03:16.079 --> 01:03:18.379
And when this cover opens,
I'm not gonna be here..

01:03:20.015 --> 01:03:21.916
'...and I don't wanna ever see
you two around here again.'

01:03:21.918 --> 01:03:24.785
- 'do you get that?'
- Yeah. We understand.

01:03:26.922 --> 01:03:29.890
Okay, we just break this whole
thing off to a lesson learned.

01:03:29.892 --> 01:03:31.692
That's all it was.

01:03:52.881 --> 01:03:54.715
Open!

01:03:58.587 --> 01:04:00.054
Fuck!

01:04:02.991 --> 01:04:04.925
Come on. Come on.

01:04:25.881 --> 01:04:28.015
What's taking so long?

01:04:33.422 --> 01:04:36.190
I got a problem.

01:04:36.192 --> 01:04:39.460
- What?
- 'The code's not working.'

01:04:42.063 --> 01:04:44.565
you said you were gonna
let us out.

01:04:44.567 --> 01:04:47.868
I was gonna let you out,
but he gave me the code

01:04:47.870 --> 01:04:50.671
the manager, like a month ago
in case I needed it

01:04:50.673 --> 01:04:52.907
and-and now it's not working.

01:05:04.152 --> 01:05:06.520
What are we supposed to do now?

01:05:09.458 --> 01:05:11.459
I think you're on your own now.

01:05:13.829 --> 01:05:16.697
Come on,
you can't leave us here.

01:05:16.699 --> 01:05:18.766
You'll kill us.

01:05:18.768 --> 01:05:22.803
I was gonna let you out.
I-it's not my fault.

01:05:22.805 --> 01:05:26.874
Come on, please.

01:05:28.743 --> 01:05:31.479
Come on, let us out. Please!

01:05:31.481 --> 01:05:33.914
Call the police, do something.
They'll find us.

01:05:33.916 --> 01:05:35.649
No.

01:05:35.651 --> 01:05:38.219
Then the cops know about me,
I-i-i can't.

01:05:38.221 --> 01:05:41.489
No, they won't. Honestly,
we-we're not gonna say anything.

01:05:41.491 --> 01:05:44.525
'We swear to god.
Please. Please.'

01:05:44.527 --> 01:05:46.760
I can't go back to jail.
I can't do it.

01:05:46.762 --> 01:05:48.028
I'm not calling the cops.

01:05:48.030 --> 01:05:49.897
It almost killed me
the first time.

01:05:49.899 --> 01:05:52.233
It's not too late.
Come on, let us out.

01:05:52.235 --> 01:05:53.734
'If you're gonna
leave us down here'

01:05:53.736 --> 01:05:55.936
'you're gonna fucking kill us!
Please!'

01:05:55.938 --> 01:05:59.039
come on! Let us out!

01:05:59.041 --> 01:06:04.044
God! Uh! Come on, please,
let us out.

01:06:04.046 --> 01:06:07.548
Come on. Come on!

01:06:07.550 --> 01:06:09.817
'Please! Stop!'

01:06:15.590 --> 01:06:17.091
she left.

01:06:19.561 --> 01:06:21.161
She left.

01:06:22.764 --> 01:06:24.698
She left us.

01:07:19.921 --> 01:07:21.121
Bree?

01:07:22.824 --> 01:07:24.091
Bree!

01:07:35.337 --> 01:07:37.605
Bree! Bree, Bree.

01:07:37.607 --> 01:07:39.940
Bree, Bree, Bree, Bree.

01:07:39.942 --> 01:07:43.210
Bree, Bree, Bree.

01:07:43.212 --> 01:07:46.280
Oh, god. Gosh, you scared
the crap out of me.

01:07:48.016 --> 01:07:50.918
I don't think I can make it.

01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:52.019
Oh, don't talk like that.

01:07:53.889 --> 01:07:55.022
It's okay. It's okay.

01:07:55.024 --> 01:07:57.858
Well, I lied to you.

01:07:59.628 --> 01:08:00.961
What?

01:08:02.764 --> 01:08:04.798
I have a confession.

01:08:06.101 --> 01:08:08.068
Tell me, please.

01:08:10.071 --> 01:08:11.939
Jonna, I'm so sorry.

01:08:11.941 --> 01:08:13.173
If I knew he was coming to you

01:08:13.175 --> 01:08:15.843
I would have done
something sooner.

01:08:19.848 --> 01:08:22.049
I saw him go in your room

01:08:22.051 --> 01:08:23.850
and I knew.

01:08:26.154 --> 01:08:28.255
That night when the fire started

01:08:28.256 --> 01:08:30.189
it all happened so fast.

01:08:30.192 --> 01:08:33.661
It just caught up.
It started burning.

01:08:33.662 --> 01:08:36.729
He tried to get up,
but I held him down.

01:08:39.134 --> 01:08:41.835
I held him back
until he stopped moving.

01:08:46.073 --> 01:08:48.942
Until I knew he wouldn't go
into your room again.

01:08:54.783 --> 01:08:56.783
I killed the monster.

01:09:03.058 --> 01:09:04.425
Come on.

01:09:09.464 --> 01:09:11.031
Come on.

01:09:43.497 --> 01:09:45.966
It's my turn to carry you now.

01:11:18.827 --> 01:11:20.494
I need this, okay?

01:12:19.021 --> 01:12:21.255
God. Fuck!

01:13:16.477 --> 01:13:19.279
No, no, no, no, no.

01:13:19.281 --> 01:13:21.381
No. No, don't you die on me.

01:13:21.383 --> 01:13:23.984
No. Hey, hey.

01:13:28.589 --> 01:13:31.091
Come on, I got the grate.
We're getting out of here.

01:13:31.093 --> 01:13:32.426
Come on.

01:13:33.594 --> 01:13:35.062
Bree.

01:13:36.331 --> 01:13:38.498
Wake your ass up!

01:13:39.534 --> 01:13:42.269
Wake your ass up! Come on!

01:13:50.378 --> 01:13:53.447
Okay, okay.
I need you to hold on.

01:13:53.449 --> 01:13:56.450
I need you to hold on
for me, Bree.

01:14:23.277 --> 01:14:24.611
Fuck!

01:14:53.574 --> 01:14:57.310
Okay, come on. Finally.

01:14:57.312 --> 01:14:58.712
Come on.

01:14:58.714 --> 01:15:02.682
Oh. Come on, Bree. We're out.

01:15:02.684 --> 01:15:04.818
Come on. Okay.

01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:08.288
Bree. Ah, Bree, we made it.

01:15:08.290 --> 01:15:11.725
Come on. Hey. Hey.

01:15:11.727 --> 01:15:15.195
Come on. Come on, Bree,
it's fine, baby.

01:15:15.197 --> 01:15:19.232
Please. Please. Come on,
I need you to breathe now.

01:15:19.234 --> 01:15:21.435
Hey, come on.

01:15:21.437 --> 01:15:24.204
Hey, we're so close.
Come on now, Bree. Come on.

01:15:24.206 --> 01:15:26.306
Oh, god.

01:15:26.308 --> 01:15:28.542
Oh, fuck. Oh, god.

01:15:28.544 --> 01:15:32.079
'Uh, oh, stay here.'

01:15:38.286 --> 01:15:39.453
'god.'

01:15:40.588 --> 01:15:42.656
what am I doing?

01:15:50.132 --> 01:15:53.333
Come on. Hey, hey, hey.

01:15:56.137 --> 01:15:58.638
I love you, Bree.

01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:03.310
Come on. Breathe, baby, please.

01:16:03.312 --> 01:16:05.712
Come on! Come on.

01:16:08.649 --> 01:16:11.151
Come on, open those eyes.

01:16:11.153 --> 01:16:13.186
'Come on, do this.'

01:16:13.188 --> 01:16:15.388
you're not gonna die.

01:16:15.390 --> 01:16:17.390
Come on, baby.

01:16:20.461 --> 01:16:21.661
<i>Bree.</i>

01:16:28.236 --> 01:16:32.172
Come on, Bree. You can do it.

01:16:32.174 --> 01:16:34.774
'Come on, baby. Hey.'

01:16:36.210 --> 01:16:38.245
there she is.

01:16:42.150 --> 01:16:44.184
Oh, my god.

01:16:44.186 --> 01:16:46.753
There you go. Come on.

01:16:57.598 --> 01:16:59.432
What are you doing?

01:16:59.434 --> 01:17:01.754
I had a feeling you were gonna
get yourselves out of there.

01:17:04.539 --> 01:17:07.240
You just got that fighting
spirit in you, don't you?

01:17:09.377 --> 01:17:12.412
- Just like my little girl.
- Why?

01:17:12.414 --> 01:17:14.748
No. Just shut up!

01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:17.284
Maybe there is no reason.

01:17:17.286 --> 01:17:19.319
What are you gonna do?

01:17:21.789 --> 01:17:25.892
I shouldn't have done what
I did, but it's too late now.

01:17:27.929 --> 01:17:30.864
I, I made it all the way
to the car

01:17:30.866 --> 01:17:34.434
and I, I couldn't stop
thinking about you girls

01:17:34.436 --> 01:17:37.671
and, and what was gonna happen
if you didn't die in there.

01:17:39.507 --> 01:17:41.775
What was gonna happen to me?

01:17:43.811 --> 01:17:46.213
Just listen to me, okay?

01:17:46.215 --> 01:17:48.882
Okay, you have lost so much.

01:17:48.884 --> 01:17:50.717
We all have.

01:17:50.719 --> 01:17:53.553
But please, please,
listen to me.

01:17:53.555 --> 01:17:55.422
Don't let me lose
my sister, okay?

01:17:55.424 --> 01:17:58.825
She's, she's the only thing
I have left in this entire life.

01:17:58.827 --> 01:18:00.694
- Please.
- I'm sorry.

01:18:09.270 --> 01:18:11.571
Oh, no. Don't.

01:18:46.674 --> 01:18:50.644
Help.
We're at the katea public pool.

01:18:50.646 --> 01:18:54.514
My sister, she's dying.

01:18:54.516 --> 01:18:56.016
Please hurry.

01:19:09.063 --> 01:19:10.797
Just go.

01:19:10.799 --> 01:19:12.799
Get, get out of here.

01:19:16.437 --> 01:19:18.505
Go.

01:19:33.054 --> 01:19:35.488
Bree.

01:19:35.490 --> 01:19:37.557
Bree.

01:19:37.559 --> 01:19:39.092
Bree.

01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:48.435
This is real?

01:19:50.604 --> 01:19:51.871
It's real.

01:19:55.109 --> 01:19:56.943
You did it.

01:19:56.945 --> 01:19:58.511
We did it.

01:20:00.348 --> 01:20:02.349
I never doubted you.

01:20:08.622 --> 01:20:10.623
I guess we're even.

01:20:12.893 --> 01:20:14.494
Not yet.

01:20:31.545 --> 01:20:32.846
How?

01:20:36.817 --> 01:20:38.985
We killed the monster.
