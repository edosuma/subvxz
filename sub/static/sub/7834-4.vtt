01:22.015 --> 01:26.042
<i>Five, four, three, two, one.</i>

01:26.152 --> 01:28.086
Well, that's all the time we have.

01:28.188 --> 01:32.090
So long, kids!

01:32.192 --> 01:34.456
<i>Krusty the Clown is brought to you...</i>

01:34.561 --> 01:36.461

01:36.563 --> 01:39.726
<i>It's slightly faster... to the max!</i>

01:41.134 --> 01:42.601
<i>256?</i>

01:42.702 --> 01:45.899
And I'm stuck with this useless 252.

01:47.540 --> 01:49.440
Don't destroy me.

01:49.542 --> 01:51.601
I can still make you happy...

01:51.711 --> 01:54.043
to the max!

01:54.147 --> 01:56.081
Here's a headline forJay.

01:56.182 --> 02:00.380
"Ketchup Truck Hits Hamburger Stand."

02:02.288 --> 02:05.348
Mom, can I have 200 bucks
for a 256-K Gamestation?

02:05.458 --> 02:10.395
- That's less than a dollar a K.
- Oh, I might be able to help you-

02:10.497 --> 02:13.022
with a song about thrift!

02:13.133 --> 02:15.658
#When you get a penny from a chum #

02:15.768 --> 02:18.566
# Don't just buy
some bubble gum #

02:18.671 --> 02:20.969
# Put it in your cap, Put it in your cap #

02:21.074 --> 02:23.668
#When you find a nickel in the snow #

02:23.776 --> 02:26.108
# Don't just blow it
on a picture show #

02:26.212 --> 02:30.114
- # Put it in your cap, Put it in your cap #
- I don't have a cap.

02:30.216 --> 02:34.312
#When you spy a quarter in a pie-##

02:34.420 --> 02:37.389
You want money?
Get a job like your old man.

02:37.490 --> 02:39.287
Well, maybe I should.

02:39.392 --> 02:42.953
- So now you're smarter than your old man, huh?
- I guess.

02:43.062 --> 02:45.496
I like your attitude.
Take what you need.

02:53.206 --> 02:55.970
Nice day's work, kid.
This is for you.

02:57.911 --> 03:01.369
You're paying me in hair?
Are you insane?

03:06.286 --> 03:08.584
Man, I need a job.

03:08.688 --> 03:12.624
You need job? I have job for you.

03:14.160 --> 03:17.755
You take these.
You hang Thai menu on door.

03:17.864 --> 03:21.891
I get more business.
Send daughters to small liberal arts college-

03:22.001 --> 03:24.026
Swarthmore, maybe Sarah Lawrence.

03:24.137 --> 03:25.104
Call professors by first name.
Hah!

03:31.744 --> 03:32.711
- Dynamite!
- Hang 'em on the door. Got it.

03:32.845 --> 03:33.812
Hey, hey! No menus-

03:33.913 --> 03:35.574
Or I'll cut you like
a box along the flaps!

03:39.252 --> 03:43.348
You quitter! Quitter boy! Quitter boy!

03:43.456 --> 03:45.856
- I'm sorry.
- Now restaurant fail...

03:45.959 --> 03:47.859
children go to state college.

03:47.961 --> 03:51.522
Serious students powerless
against drunken "jockocracy."

03:51.631 --> 03:53.758
Baseball hats everywhere!

03:53.866 --> 03:55.731
Hey, man, this job is too dangerous.

03:55.835 --> 03:58.531
Menu boy no be coward like shrimp.

03:58.638 --> 04:01.106
Menu boy be brave like prawn.

04:04.177 --> 04:08.136
Menu boy must move
silently like ghost.

04:08.248 --> 04:12.344
Leave no footprint,
only lunch specials.

04:12.452 --> 04:16.411
<i>Hai!</i>

04:27.967 --> 04:30.936
Hmm?

04:40.913 --> 04:42.813
Well, I never!

04:44.384 --> 04:46.750
Ah! What a waste.

04:51.858 --> 04:55.021
There you go, little fish. Ohh.

04:55.128 --> 04:59.155
Bart, do you know how many trees
died to make those menus?

04:59.265 --> 05:02.757
- I don't know. A million?
- You're ruining the earth!

05:02.869 --> 05:04.860
True, but I "gots" to get paid.

05:04.971 --> 05:07.064
Money was funny, Sister.

05:07.173 --> 05:08.868
Oh, Betty.

05:10.977 --> 05:15.073
Bart, it's so sweet of you to take
the family out to Krusty Burger.

05:15.181 --> 05:19.140
Hey, some people in this family
are doers, and some are "don't-ers."

05:19.252 --> 05:22.016
Don't you call me a- Ugh.

05:22.121 --> 05:25.579
Take that, Lisa's beliefs!

05:28.328 --> 05:31.320
Oh, how cute!
Kids, look who's on the roof.

05:32.598 --> 05:34.498
I knew this day would come.

05:34.600 --> 05:36.693
The cows are taking back what's theirs.

05:36.803 --> 05:38.998
No. I think they're protestors.

05:41.541 --> 05:43.475
Hey, there <i>are</i> cows on the roof.

05:43.576 --> 05:45.806
I thought my pager was busted.

05:45.912 --> 05:50.042
Get back in. It's only funny with a small car.

05:55.521 --> 05:59.082
Take down the clown! Take down the clown!

05:59.192 --> 06:02.628
Listen, I'm on your side.
Let's get a dialogue going.

06:02.729 --> 06:06.529
Take out the mother cow.
The rest will follow.

06:06.632 --> 06:08.600
Your corporation cuts down the rain forest...

06:08.701 --> 06:10.601
to create grazing land for cattle.

06:10.703 --> 06:13.297
Oh, for the love of- Gimme that!

06:13.406 --> 06:16.102
No, you can't!

06:16.209 --> 06:20.646
- Don't worry, honey. They're just firing beanbags.
- Ow!

06:20.747 --> 06:23.215
- Hey, watch it!
- You can't silence the truth with beanbags!

06:26.119 --> 06:28.144
That's nice work
with the "bag-zooka."

06:28.254 --> 06:31.087
Gotta love what you do, Chief.
Mmm, mmm.

06:31.190 --> 06:34.318
Are you all right?

06:34.427 --> 06:36.327
I've had worse.

06:36.429 --> 06:39.660
In New Orleans, they hosed us with Tabasco.

06:39.766 --> 06:42.030
Oh, you're so heroic.

06:42.135 --> 06:44.103
All right, <i>cow</i> boy.

06:44.203 --> 06:46.899
I'll see you in "moo-nicipal" court.

06:47.006 --> 06:49.770
- Good one, Chief.
- What? What'd I say?

06:49.876 --> 06:52.538
I can't believe how young he is.

06:52.645 --> 06:55.113
<i>He'd be cute ifhe weren't so idealistic.</i>

06:56.849 --> 06:59.784
Mmm.

06:59.886 --> 07:02.753
Look, Marge. I'm in a limo.

07:02.855 --> 07:06.291
The Simpsons are goin' to Paris.

07:09.195 --> 07:11.629
The "eco-radical"
group Dirt First...

07:11.731 --> 07:14.495
staged a daring protest
today at Krusty Burger.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.625
Krusty the Clown has issued
the following statement.

07:16.736 --> 07:18.636
"This I don't need."

07:18.738 --> 07:22.401
The group is led
by teenage activistJesse Grass...

07:22.508 --> 07:27.741
a "dreadlocked" dreamboat
whose "Birken stock" is on the rise.

07:27.847 --> 07:31.112
<i>Boring.</i>

07:32.985 --> 07:37.115
Ah, the Luftwaffe-
The Washington Generals of the History Channel.

07:37.223 --> 07:39.123
Dad, change it back.

07:39.225 --> 07:42.194
- Yeah. That was the boy Lisa likes.
- No, I don't.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.593
Lisa and Jesse sitting in a tree...

07:44.697 --> 07:47.325
- K-l-S-S-l-N-G-
- Shut up.

07:47.433 --> 07:50.163
First comes love, then comes-

07:50.269 --> 07:52.237
Um- Damn it, I know this.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.276
I'd like to visit a prisoner.

07:57.376 --> 08:00.470
- Yeah, sure.
- Aren't you coming with me?

08:00.580 --> 08:04.175
Hey, I get enough flaming toilet paper
thrown on me at home.

08:06.285 --> 08:08.185
<i>Fire in the hole!</i>

08:10.723 --> 08:13.419
Jesse?

08:13.526 --> 08:16.859
- You do yoga?
- Yeah, but I started before it was cool.

08:16.963 --> 08:20.729
My name's Lisa Simpson.
I think your protest was incredibly brave.

08:20.833 --> 08:23.859
Thank you. This planet needs
every friend it can get.

08:23.970 --> 08:27.406
Oh, the earth is the best.
That's why I'm a vegetarian.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.975
Well, that's a start.

08:30.076 --> 08:32.601
Well, um, I was thinking
of going vegan.

08:32.712 --> 08:34.611
I'm a level-five vegan.

08:34.714 --> 08:36.614
I won't eat anything
that casts a shadow.

08:36.716 --> 08:38.980
Wow. Um-

08:39.085 --> 08:42.111
I started an organic
compost pile at home.

08:42.221 --> 08:45.054
Only at home?
You mean you don't pocket-mulch?

08:45.157 --> 08:48.092
Oh, it's so decomposed.

08:48.194 --> 08:50.355
Do you think I could join Dirt First?

08:50.463 --> 08:53.899
Well, we might have
an opening at the poseur level.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.127
Oh, thank you, thank you.

08:59.205 --> 09:02.197
- Have a good time at your hippie club.
- You're welcome to come too.

09:02.308 --> 09:05.744
No. I like to save
the environment my own way.

09:11.617 --> 09:14.017
<i>Mmm... doughnuts.</i>

09:14.120 --> 09:18.352
I am happy to report we've succeeded
in blocking the St. Patrick's Day Parade...

09:18.457 --> 09:20.755
which, every year,
steps on several lizards.

09:20.860 --> 09:22.384
- Right on!
- Yeah!

09:22.495 --> 09:24.395
Don't celebrate yet.

09:24.497 --> 09:27.193
The mayor had a secret
tree auction last night.

09:27.300 --> 09:29.200
What am I bid...

09:29.302 --> 09:33.261
for the logging rights
to Springfield's oldest redwood tree?

09:33.372 --> 09:36.773
$30,000 to make cages
for animal experimentation.

09:36.876 --> 09:39.208
50,000 for Thai menus.

09:39.312 --> 09:41.712
Daughter on wait list at Bennington.

09:41.814 --> 09:44.510
100,000 simoleons...

09:44.617 --> 09:48.280
to make the world's
first drive-through humidor.

09:48.387 --> 09:50.582
Sold to the rich Texan.

09:50.690 --> 09:54.649
Yee-haw!

09:54.760 --> 09:58.287
Whoo, doggies!

09:58.397 --> 10:01.764
Thanks to Caleb for the tape.
How'd you sneak that camera in?

10:01.867 --> 10:04.768
I got my ways.

10:04.870 --> 10:07.930
They can't cut down that sequoia
if one of us is living in it.

10:08.040 --> 10:10.235
- Any volunteers?
- I'll do it.

10:10.343 --> 10:12.709
- I am so there!
- Oh, me, me, me!

10:12.812 --> 10:16.748
Whoa. Hold on. Once you're up there,
you can't come down-

10:16.849 --> 10:20.751
Not for a Phish concert,
not even for Burning Man.

10:20.853 --> 10:23.219
Well, someone will hear the call...

10:25.992 --> 10:29.155
<i>and whoever does will</i>
<i>have a place in my heart.</i>

10:29.261 --> 10:31.161
Mm-hmm.

10:32.665 --> 10:36.066
Sheesh. Look at these refugees.
How about a smile?

10:36.168 --> 10:39.103
They've undergone
terrible hardships.

10:39.205 --> 10:41.002
Well, moping won't make it better.

10:41.107 --> 10:44.634
Mom, Dad, there's
something I have to do.

10:44.744 --> 10:48.510
You're not gonna like it,
but I really believe it's the right thing.

10:49.882 --> 10:52.976
Marge, she's gonna narc on our stash.

10:53.085 --> 10:55.053
We don't have a stash.

10:55.154 --> 10:57.918
No. Of course not.

11:09.335 --> 11:11.565
<i>Wow.</i>

11:11.671 --> 11:14.765
Oh, I didn't think
it would be so high.

11:14.874 --> 11:18.571
Maybe I could just
circulate a petition.

11:21.914 --> 11:23.814
Oh, I'll show you.

11:43.636 --> 11:47.072
Well, this looks like
a good place to set up camp.

11:48.507 --> 11:50.998
Wow! What a view.

12:00.219 --> 12:03.211
Gentlemen, start your chain saws.

12:03.322 --> 12:06.655
<i>Not so fast!</i>

12:09.428 --> 12:12.761
Now, you come down from there, missy!

12:12.865 --> 12:16.596
I won't come down
till you spare this tree.

12:20.005 --> 12:23.202
- Hang in there, Laura!
- <i>It's Lisa!</i>

12:23.309 --> 12:26.540
Right! Lisa. You're hard core.

12:26.645 --> 12:29.136
Oh, he said I was hard core.

12:29.248 --> 12:32.149
Oh-Whoa!

12:38.124 --> 12:41.059
Oh, no! My baby's up there!

12:41.160 --> 12:44.789
It's okay, Mom. I have a safety line.

12:44.897 --> 12:49.027
This is your fault, with your nonthreatening,
Bobby Sherman-style good looks.

12:49.135 --> 12:51.160
No girl could resist your charms.

12:51.270 --> 12:53.864
- This was her choice, Mr. Simpson.
- I'm sorry.

12:53.973 --> 12:56.339
I wasn't listening.
I was lost in your eyes.

12:58.077 --> 12:59.942
<i>All right! A care bucket.</i>

13:04.083 --> 13:05.983
Hot Thai soup!

13:06.085 --> 13:07.985
Oh, Bart!

13:08.087 --> 13:10.453
"Dear Lisa, you rock.

13:10.556 --> 13:12.649
"Mom is calling rescue agencies...

13:12.758 --> 13:14.658
"Dad is building a giant ladder...

13:14.760 --> 13:16.728
"but it is of poor quality.

13:16.829 --> 13:19.491
We miss you. Bart." Aww.

13:19.598 --> 13:24.228
It's day four for Springfield's "li'lest" tree hugger.

13:24.336 --> 13:26.395
Excuse me. That's "littlest" tree hugger.

13:26.505 --> 13:27.767
And whether you love
or hate her politics...

13:27.873 --> 13:29.340
you've gotta go gawk
at this crazy idiot.

13:35.815 --> 13:36.782
Oh.

13:36.882 --> 13:37.849
Oh, 7:00.

13:37.950 --> 13:39.440
The family's just sitting down to dinner.

13:40.452 --> 13:45.822
- Aww.
- You call that saying grace?

13:55.334 --> 14:00.499
<i>Oh, now they're making popcorn</i>
<i>and hanging Christmas stockings.</i>

14:00.606 --> 14:02.870
<i>And coloring Easter eggs.</i>

14:02.975 --> 14:05.000
Oh, I can't take it.

14:05.110 --> 14:08.341
Would it be so bad
if I just went home for an hour?

14:10.449 --> 14:12.781
Whoa.

14:16.589 --> 14:20.389
Don't worry. I'll be right back.

14:20.492 --> 14:23.461
Ew. Someone's been
marking their territory.

14:26.866 --> 14:30.563
Hey, everybody. L-

14:32.972 --> 14:35.236
Aww.

14:36.642 --> 14:38.769
I'll just rest here for a minute.

14:41.046 --> 14:42.946
Ahh.

14:52.358 --> 14:55.384
Oh, it's morning! I gotta get back.

15:01.901 --> 15:05.337
Ooh. Oh, no.

15:08.638 --> 15:12.005
Oh, Mom, those loggers
chopped down the tree.

15:12.108 --> 15:14.167
Why did I have to leave my post?

15:14.277 --> 15:18.043
Now, honey, let's turn on the news
and forget our troubles.

15:18.148 --> 15:21.345
Springfield's oldest resident has died.

15:21.451 --> 15:24.249
No, it wasn't Mr. Burns.

15:24.354 --> 15:26.481
It was this majestic old redwood...

15:26.590 --> 15:29.684
<i>which was brutally</i>
<i>cut down last night-</i>

15:29.793 --> 15:32.956
Not by loggers, but by lightning-

15:33.063 --> 15:34.928
Lightning? Oh!

15:35.031 --> 15:36.931
At least it wasn't my fault.

15:37.033 --> 15:40.764
Lightning attracted by this metal bucket.

15:40.870 --> 15:44.033
Still unknown is the fate
of tree-sitter Lisa Simpson.

15:44.140 --> 15:46.267
I'm afraid it doesn't look good, Kent.

15:46.376 --> 15:48.867
We found her sleeping bag right here.

15:48.979 --> 15:51.914
Our working theory is
that the lightning exploded her.

15:52.015 --> 15:54.347
- Back to you, Kent.
- You don't get to say that!

15:54.451 --> 15:57.352
Good-bye, Lisa. We'll miss you.

15:57.454 --> 15:59.615
Oh, no! Lisa's gone!

15:59.723 --> 16:02.658
And nothing will bring her back.

16:02.759 --> 16:05.728
- Unless-
- Dad, I'm not dead.

16:05.829 --> 16:08.491
Oh, praise God! You're alive.

16:08.598 --> 16:11.294
- Unless-
- Oh, my.

16:11.401 --> 16:13.631
They made you a shrine.

16:15.538 --> 16:18.666
I loved Lisa Simpson-
Loved her like a shrub.

16:18.775 --> 16:21.938
And I would give anything
to see her sweet face again.

16:22.045 --> 16:24.104
Oh!

16:24.214 --> 16:29.208
But in death, she will do more for our cause
than she ever could have done in life.

16:29.319 --> 16:32.220
Uh-huh. In Texas,
we do tragedy right.

16:32.322 --> 16:34.722
That's why in memory
of that poor little girl...

16:34.824 --> 16:39.784
I'm turning this entire forest
into the Lisa Simpson Wilderness Preserve.

16:39.896 --> 16:41.864
We won, Lisa.

16:41.965 --> 16:44.229
We finally won.

16:44.334 --> 16:46.632
This is for you.

16:49.873 --> 16:53.240
He cut off his favorite dread.

16:53.343 --> 16:56.938
We have to tell them you're not dead.

16:58.048 --> 17:00.539
No, Mom. It's a memorial forest now.

17:00.650 --> 17:03.050
If I'm alive, they'll cut it down.

17:03.153 --> 17:05.951
You are not pretending
to be dead, young lady.

17:06.056 --> 17:09.082
This family has had nothing but bad luck
when it comes to farce.

17:09.192 --> 17:11.387
<i>Homer, it's Neddie.</i>

17:11.493 --> 17:13.621
I baked you a little something
to ease the pain.

17:13.730 --> 17:15.664
Oh!

17:15.765 --> 17:17.892
Must hide Lisa!

17:18.001 --> 17:20.799
Come in.

17:22.472 --> 17:24.372
So, Bart, our school policy...

17:24.473 --> 17:27.102
is to give students
in your situation straight A's.

17:27.210 --> 17:30.702
- Get out! What's the catch?
- The tragic loss of your sister.

17:30.814 --> 17:33.476
Ah, yes. Ghastly business, that.

17:38.788 --> 17:42.724
- Grieving father comin' through.
- Homer, uh, booze is on the house...

17:42.826 --> 17:45.886
seeing as how Lisa is, um-

17:45.995 --> 17:48.122
Oh, how do I put this?

17:48.231 --> 17:50.756
Ridin' the midnight train to slab city.

17:50.867 --> 17:52.767
Thanks for the beer, Moe.

17:52.869 --> 17:56.600
But before Lisa died, she made this tape
that I think you should hear.

17:56.706 --> 17:59.641
Dear Moe, if anything should ever happen to me...

17:59.743 --> 18:02.439
I want you to tear up my dad's tab...

18:02.545 --> 18:04.513
and pour cocktail onions-

18:04.614 --> 18:06.946
- Dad, I can't.
- Read it!

18:07.050 --> 18:11.077
Pour cocktail onions down your pants.

18:11.187 --> 18:14.452
Well, I ain't never
said no to a dead girl yet.

18:18.161 --> 18:20.891
And now, Branford Marsalis will play...

18:20.997 --> 18:23.465
using Lisa's very own saxophone.

18:23.566 --> 18:26.501
Don't touch it!
They can clone her from the spit.

18:26.603 --> 18:28.969
<i>Good luck, Milhouse.</i>

18:29.072 --> 18:31.632
And finally, an exciting announcement...

18:31.741 --> 18:34.574
from our good friends at Omni-Pave.

18:34.677 --> 18:38.443
Folks, last night the dear departed Lisa
came to me in a dream...

18:38.548 --> 18:43.008
and she told me her fondest wish
was that this forest would become...

18:43.119 --> 18:47.215
the world's "rootin'est," "tootin'est,"
"pollutin'est" amusement park!

18:49.626 --> 18:51.526
<i>It was Lisa's dream.</i>

18:52.829 --> 18:55.059
You promised us a nature preserve.

18:55.165 --> 19:00.603
Now, don't you fret.
We're sensitive to all your "eco-concerns."

19:00.703 --> 19:02.500
That's it, boys.

19:02.605 --> 19:04.505
The gift shop will go right there.

19:04.607 --> 19:06.666
Yee-haw! Cut it down!

19:06.776 --> 19:08.676
- <i>No!</i>
- Wha-

19:13.082 --> 19:15.277
A g-g-g-girl!

19:15.385 --> 19:20.015
I'm not dead-And neither
is my sense of moral outrage.

19:20.123 --> 19:23.388
- Oh, here we go.
- Sir, have you no shame?

19:23.493 --> 19:25.461
Clearly, I don't.

19:27.564 --> 19:30.260
Now get your heinie
off of Lisa Land!

19:30.366 --> 19:34.029
A redwood is not a promotional tool.

19:35.772 --> 19:38.536
Good Lord! He's cutting the guy-wires!

19:54.357 --> 19:56.188
Nice work, tree.

19:56.292 --> 19:58.954
Now return to me.

19:59.062 --> 20:00.962
- I don't get it.
- What?

20:01.064 --> 20:05.524
Oh, right- I don't have super powers... just yet.

20:05.635 --> 20:08.433
Sweet. It's headed
for the business district.

20:12.108 --> 20:13.735
Not my company!

20:23.219 --> 20:27.713
No! It was finger Ling-Ling good.

20:29.792 --> 20:31.589
Whoa!

20:31.694 --> 20:33.855
No!

20:33.963 --> 20:38.730
Yee-haw! Score one for the bad guys.

20:41.137 --> 20:43.002
Hey, Lisa.

20:43.106 --> 20:45.472
Aw, Jesse, they locked you up again.

20:45.575 --> 20:47.668
Yeah, but I'm still fighting for the earth.

20:47.777 --> 20:50.268
I even got 'em to install
a solar-powered electric chair.

20:50.380 --> 20:52.610
Dude, we've been here all morning.

20:52.715 --> 20:55.377
Could you at least
re-moisten my head sponge?

20:55.485 --> 20:57.510
Well, I'll write you letters-

20:57.620 --> 21:00.054
on rice paper with a soy pencil.

21:00.156 --> 21:03.489
Aw, you're sweet.

21:03.593 --> 21:05.857
- Did they ever stop that log?
- Not yet.

21:05.962 --> 21:08.430
What's up with that?

21:08.531 --> 21:11.022
<i>#This log is your log #</i>

21:11.134 --> 21:13.227
<i># This log is my log #</i>

21:13.336 --> 21:15.702
<i># When lightning struck it #</i>

21:15.805 --> 21:17.830
<i># It kicked the bucket #</i>

21:17.941 --> 21:19.932
# I poured some onions #

21:20.043 --> 21:23.240
# Inside my trousers #

21:23.346 --> 21:26.509
<i>#This log, It used to be a tree #</i>

21:26.616 --> 21:31.519
<i># Now it spreads love to you and me #</i>

21:31.621 --> 21:34.488
<i># Hey, look</i>
<i>It's heading out #</i>

21:34.591 --> 21:39.324
<i># To sea ##</i>

22:24.807 --> 22:26.775
Shh!
