00:03.270 --> 00:06.470
A raid is a large-scale battle

00:06.470 --> 00:09.990
with many adventurers, 
instead of the usual party of six.

00:11.990 --> 00:15.080
The most common type is called a "Full Raid,"

00:14.340 --> 00:18.400
<b>Full Raid</b>

00:15.080 --> 00:18.410
and involves twenty-four players, 
in four groups of six.

00:19.150 --> 00:21.910
It comes with all the fun of a large-scale battle.

00:24.260 --> 00:27.980
A raid requires more than high 
levels and good equipment.

00:28.510 --> 00:31.010
You must analyze the opponent and form a plan,

00:31.330 --> 00:35.010
and players must work together 
to carry out that plan.

00:36.450 --> 00:38.600
You aren't just a random group of people.

00:39.820 --> 00:42.770
The most important element 
is your willingness to trust

00:42.770 --> 00:44.680
your companions with your lives.

00:45.190 --> 00:46.900
That means we'll need people.

00:47.650 --> 00:49.050
I know a place we could go.

00:50.340 --> 00:51.770
You can't mean...

00:50.780 --> 00:53.030
<b>Susukino</b>

02:24.040 --> 02:27.910
The capital of the Ezzo Empire, and the 
defensive base against the giants.

02:27.910 --> 02:30.250
This is the fortress city of Susukino.

02:31.750 --> 02:33.190
No guards, huh?

02:33.530 --> 02:35.510
They've gotten lax.

02:36.300 --> 02:38.210
Things change in six months.

02:38.680 --> 02:39.510
A lot of things.

02:39.900 --> 02:42.530
Well, good luck, Shiro.

02:43.490 --> 02:43.890
Yeah.

02:44.840 --> 02:45.840
You, too.

02:47.890 --> 02:53.610
<b>The Outlaw and Mithril Eyes</b>

<b>William Massachusetts 
Race/ Elf 
Assassin, Lv. 95 
Silver Sword Guild Master</b>

03:10.300 --> 03:13.380
It's been a long time, William Massachusetts.

03:13.790 --> 03:15.150
Call me William...

03:15.150 --> 03:16.860
Mr. Shiroe?

03:16.860 --> 03:18.280
Shiroe is fine.

03:22.180 --> 03:24.950
<i>Along with D.D.D. and the Black Sword Knights,</i>

03:24.950 --> 03:28.010
<i>Silver Sword is one of Akihabara's big combat guilds.</i>

03:28.950 --> 03:31.190
<i>When the Round Table was formed,</i>

03:31.190 --> 03:34.020
<i>they were asked to be one of 
the participating guilds, but...</i>

03:35.620 --> 03:39.280
Let those who care about the 
city solve its problems.

03:39.840 --> 03:43.150
Regardless, we aren't interested.

03:43.150 --> 03:45.120
Do it without us.

03:45.860 --> 03:51.000
<i>They moved their base here, to Susukino, 
in search of more difficult raids.</i>

03:51.970 --> 03:55.980
<i>Which means that no one's 
paying attention to them.</i>

03:56.800 --> 03:59.500
<i>Right now, he's the only one I can ask.</i>

04:00.800 --> 04:03.550
I've come with a request for you,

04:04.080 --> 04:05.550
as the Silver Sword guild master.

04:05.550 --> 04:07.050
Understood. I'm in.

04:08.150 --> 04:12.810
A man's come all the way out to the ends 
of the North to ask for my help.

04:13.310 --> 04:16.310
Wouldn't it be rude to wait 
to hear what he wanted?

04:17.490 --> 04:18.530
Thanks.

04:19.000 --> 04:19.990
Well?

04:19.990 --> 04:21.650
I'm requesting your participation in a full raid.

04:22.270 --> 04:26.750
In a new raid zone at the lowest 
level of the Depths of Palm.

04:27.520 --> 04:31.690
It's a full raid, so only twenty-four 
adventurers can go in at once.

04:32.330 --> 04:34.660
We can't rely on numbers.

04:35.050 --> 04:37.170
Then we'll have to go in to investigate it.

04:37.560 --> 04:39.050
Already done.

04:39.570 --> 04:40.350
Oh?

04:43.040 --> 04:44.390
Look at this!

04:44.390 --> 04:46.030
What a surprise.

04:46.030 --> 04:47.430
That's enough for today.

04:47.430 --> 04:48.400
Let's go back.

04:48.400 --> 04:49.330
Right on.

04:50.220 --> 04:53.260
Oh, my... There are monsters everywhere.

04:50.750 --> 04:56.180
<b>Orks' Jelly
Rank/ Raid</b>

04:53.580 --> 04:55.660
The enemies are above level 80.

04:56.630 --> 04:59.190
I believe it will be extremely difficult.

04:59.190 --> 05:00.740
What types of enemies?

05:01.240 --> 05:03.360
The ones we saw were slimes.

05:03.910 --> 05:05.700
More than five meters in diameter.

05:06.410 --> 05:08.500
The rest is only my guess,

05:08.500 --> 05:12.280
but given the layout of the facility 
and the legends surrounding it,

05:12.280 --> 05:15.050
I believe there's a large monster, 
either a giant or a phantom beast.

05:15.050 --> 05:17.460
A giant? Convenient.

05:18.090 --> 05:21.230
We're based in Susukino, so we're used to them.

05:21.780 --> 05:24.290
But there are still problems.

05:27.520 --> 05:29.550
Have you ever been to Susukino?

05:29.550 --> 05:31.120
Yes, a few times.

05:31.120 --> 05:34.730
I'd heard it had gotten dangerous 
after the Apocalypse.

05:35.050 --> 05:38.310
Silver Sword's presence here is a big help.

05:38.310 --> 05:41.050
Nothing like having a well-ordered 
combat guild around.

05:41.450 --> 05:44.240
They aren't thugs like Brigandia.

05:45.040 --> 05:49.240
I suppose those thugs must have 
wandered off somewhere.

05:49.690 --> 05:51.700
What do you mean, problems?

05:51.700 --> 05:54.500
Right now, we're shut down.

05:55.240 --> 05:56.790
We don't have enough people.

05:57.900 --> 06:01.270
Some members couldn't keep up with the raids.

06:01.270 --> 06:03.020
And some people are still in the guild,

06:03.020 --> 06:06.060
but they don't want to participate 
in any more large-scale fights.

06:06.060 --> 06:07.760
In other words, they've retired.

06:08.370 --> 06:10.710
They could do an easy raid,

06:10.710 --> 06:12.760
but not a really rough one.

06:13.220 --> 06:15.100
This one will be top-level difficulty, right?

06:15.100 --> 06:20.270
We're up to level 95, but we can 
only take twenty people at most.

06:21.100 --> 06:23.840
Is that because of your memories?

06:25.130 --> 06:28.780
Oh, that story about how if you 
die, you lose your memories?

06:29.290 --> 06:31.990
We don't believe idle gossip like that.

06:32.270 --> 06:34.010
We aren't scared or anything, either.

06:34.540 --> 06:36.040
Then why?

06:36.760 --> 06:39.040
How many times have you died since then?

06:39.440 --> 06:41.530
Since the Apocalypse?

06:42.160 --> 06:43.420
No, not once.

06:44.450 --> 06:46.920
I can't explain it to someone 
who doesn't understand.

06:48.670 --> 06:50.770
When you die, you learn a lot...

06:51.410 --> 06:54.430
That you suck, that you're petty, that you're lame.

06:55.060 --> 06:57.540
If you die a hundred times, 
you learn that a hundred times.

06:57.540 --> 06:59.440
It gets too painful to continue.

07:07.090 --> 07:09.700
I'm amazed you had the guts 
to show yourself again here,

07:09.700 --> 07:11.700
Shiroe the enchanter.

07:12.850 --> 07:15.200
<b>Demikas 
Race/ Human 
Monk, Lv. 93 
Brigandia Guild Master</b>

07:19.190 --> 07:23.280
Will it be that easy to find companions?

07:23.280 --> 07:25.130
It'll be up to Shiro's negotiating abilities,

07:25.130 --> 07:28.090
but I'd like to find some backup candidates ourselves.

07:28.790 --> 07:30.250
What criteria do you use?

07:30.590 --> 07:32.450
Intuition, of course!

07:32.450 --> 07:34.600
That's rather vague.

07:34.980 --> 07:37.280
Maybe "feeling" would be a better way to put it.

07:37.700 --> 07:39.560
It's pretty important.

07:39.990 --> 07:43.500
Either way, I'll just slow you down.

07:43.500 --> 07:45.840
You hold down the fort for a bit.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.350
Oh, don't worry about me.

07:47.350 --> 07:51.450
This town is developing rapidly, 
making it a worthy subject of study.

07:54.320 --> 07:55.490
Nice panties!

07:55.490 --> 07:57.300
I'm forced to agree.

07:57.300 --> 07:59.110
You've got good taste.

07:59.110 --> 08:00.630
Aw, you flatter me.

08:00.630 --> 08:04.210
But, though I'm not too familiar 
with adventurer customs,

08:04.210 --> 08:06.460
aren't those what they call "hot pants"?

08:06.810 --> 08:10.260
Do they really merit the adoration given to panties?

08:10.450 --> 08:11.710
It's fine.

08:11.710 --> 08:13.730
If that's how you see them in your heart,

08:13.730 --> 08:15.260
they're definitely pantâ€”

08:17.320 --> 08:18.770
Are you okay?

08:18.770 --> 08:20.200
<b>Jerk</b>

08:23.190 --> 08:25.020
I guess that's enough for today.

08:25.820 --> 08:27.360
I-It's a curse!

08:27.590 --> 08:29.430
It's Akatsuki's curse!

08:29.430 --> 08:33.310
What kind of phenomenon is that?

08:33.310 --> 08:35.750
Can you give me the details?

08:35.750 --> 08:36.990
Why does that make you happy?

08:36.990 --> 08:38.990
Forget about that...

08:38.990 --> 08:40.120
Help me!

08:40.120 --> 08:41.480
Sorry, sorry.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.460
They were just such beautiful curves!

08:45.350 --> 08:48.140
If a beautiful girl like me scratched her face up,

08:48.140 --> 08:49.960
it'd be a loss to boys everywhere!

08:50.220 --> 08:51.990
She said it herself.

08:51.990 --> 08:54.470
I think that's building yourself up a bit too much.

08:55.670 --> 08:57.580
Man, you just get better and better.

08:57.580 --> 08:59.560
My opinion of you keeps shooting up!

08:59.560 --> 09:00.760
Thank you.

09:01.410 --> 09:02.890
I won't get depressed!

09:02.890 --> 09:03.980
She recovered!

09:04.620 --> 09:07.230
I'm a bright star, shining in the night sky!

09:07.230 --> 09:10.480
I'm the pretty-girl galactic idol, Tetra!

09:11.330 --> 09:12.990
Call me "Tetra"!

09:13.220 --> 09:14.330
Tetra, huh?

09:15.150 --> 09:16.990
I guess you're cute,

09:15.640 --> 09:16.470
Wink!

09:16.990 --> 09:19.740
but you're so self-satisfied, 
I don't want to tell you that.

09:17.310 --> 09:18.830
Wink! Wink!

09:20.450 --> 09:24.500
Taking into account a variety of factors...

09:24.780 --> 09:26.190
Chief among them,

09:26.820 --> 09:28.000
volume!

09:28.700 --> 09:30.750
Marie is the clear winner!

09:34.200 --> 09:35.760
Uh, I mean...

09:35.760 --> 09:36.690
Here.

09:37.800 --> 09:38.770
Thanks.

09:39.660 --> 09:42.250
<b>Tetra

09:47.400 --> 09:49.570
<i>She may actually work out.</i>

09:49.840 --> 09:52.990
Mister, no matter how pretty I am,

09:52.990 --> 09:54.610
you're staring at me too much!

09:54.990 --> 09:56.200
I am not!

09:56.200 --> 10:01.240
Well, a girl like me puts out 
pheromones at all times, after all!

10:01.240 --> 10:02.930
Pheromones! Pheromones!

10:04.590 --> 10:06.570
If they're coming from the butt you're sticking out,

10:06.570 --> 10:09.000
maybe they're fart-o-mones, not pheromones?

10:10.240 --> 10:12.250
You're seriously awesome, old man.

10:12.250 --> 10:13.940
You just keep hitting new highs!

10:13.940 --> 10:16.010
Idols don't fart!

10:16.250 --> 10:18.900
This skeleton guy is harsh, isn't he?

10:18.900 --> 10:20.290
Skeleton?

10:20.790 --> 10:24.020
Okay, the guy in the armor 
looks easier to deal with.

10:24.540 --> 10:25.980
Get off me!

10:27.140 --> 10:32.480
Nope! I love rubbing against 
guys as they freak out!

10:32.820 --> 10:34.950
By the way, I hate it when 
guys rub against me.

10:34.950 --> 10:36.000
So remember that.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.500
I said get off me!

10:42.390 --> 10:43.950
Okay, you pass.

10:45.280 --> 10:47.310
Are you absolutely sure?

10:47.310 --> 10:49.080
I told you, it's a feeling.

10:55.360 --> 10:56.590
It's all right.

10:56.850 --> 10:58.100
We're fine here.

10:58.100 --> 10:59.730
Go take a break in the back.

11:01.910 --> 11:06.100
That calm, arrogant attitude of 
yours hasn't changed a bit.

11:08.940 --> 11:13.390
You haven't forgotten my name, have you, Shiroe?

11:14.060 --> 11:16.650
It's been a long time, Mr. Democracy.

11:16.650 --> 11:18.070
You bastard!

11:18.070 --> 11:19.570
Step outside!

11:19.840 --> 11:21.560
What will we do outside?

11:21.560 --> 11:23.100
You know what!

11:23.100 --> 11:24.280
Shut up, Demi.

11:25.500 --> 11:27.200
He's my guest.

11:27.200 --> 11:28.960
I don't care.

11:28.960 --> 11:30.130
He's myâ€”

11:30.130 --> 11:31.210
You lost, right?

11:32.260 --> 11:34.270
You lost, didn't you?

11:34.270 --> 11:36.160
Don't pick a fight over it now.

11:36.160 --> 11:37.170
But...

11:38.420 --> 11:40.680
I'll crush you again, Demikas.

11:45.620 --> 11:48.180
You can't beat Shiroe anyway.

11:48.590 --> 11:52.190
I've gotten some raid items since our last fight!

11:52.520 --> 11:55.570
It's because you think equipment will 
help you beat him that you can't win.

11:55.880 --> 11:58.240
Then let's test it.

11:58.240 --> 12:01.740
Which do you like more? 
Hamburg steak or minced cutlet?

12:01.740 --> 12:03.370
I like them both.

12:03.370 --> 12:05.530
With lots of that demi-whatsits sauce.

12:05.530 --> 12:09.550
I'll rip you apart, just like you want.

12:09.550 --> 12:11.540
That isn't very nice, Mr. Deluxe.

12:14.140 --> 12:16.150
You're deliberately screwing it up, aren't you?

12:16.150 --> 12:18.130
Let me go, Mr. Tofu in Miso Sauce.

12:18.360 --> 12:20.020
You littleâ€”

12:20.020 --> 12:24.010
And so, Brigandia lost half its members.

12:24.010 --> 12:26.810
I'm sure you can see why, after he lost

12:26.810 --> 12:29.580
to a cat swordsman who wasn't even in a guild.

12:29.580 --> 12:33.840
His strategist, Londark, gave up 
on him and headed west, too.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.360
Then, what happened to Demikas?

12:35.710 --> 12:39.360
Demi-Demi and his whole guild 
work for Silver Sword now.

12:39.560 --> 12:43.230
And that's how peace came back to Susukino.

12:43.230 --> 12:44.560
I see.

12:44.560 --> 12:49.150
And Demi-Demi's wife is so great!

12:49.150 --> 12:50.710
His wife?! For real?

12:50.710 --> 12:53.380
He's married? How enviable.

12:53.890 --> 12:55.780
She's a noble with the People of the Land.

12:55.780 --> 12:58.130
He kidnapped her to make her his servant,

12:58.130 --> 13:01.190
but supposedly, he's totally in love with her now.

13:01.190 --> 13:06.410
She's great cook, and Demi-Demi loves 
her Hamburg steak and minced cutlet.

13:06.410 --> 13:07.780
That's hilarious!

13:07.780 --> 13:09.390
I'm so jealous.

13:11.760 --> 13:15.120
So he's gained quite a bit of pudge lately...

13:15.120 --> 13:15.770
Oh.

13:16.270 --> 13:17.270
Demi-Demi...

13:30.530 --> 13:31.750
He stopped at the last second?

13:32.370 --> 13:33.760
Not bad.

13:33.760 --> 13:36.610
I've taken a lot harder ones than that.

13:37.250 --> 13:39.500
Just try saying that again.

13:39.710 --> 13:44.760
I'll jam a slime down your throat and 
feed you to a giant, you bitch Tetra.

13:45.140 --> 13:46.970
Demi got mad.

13:46.970 --> 13:48.510
I said get off me!

13:48.940 --> 13:50.850
Naotsugu, who's that?

13:50.850 --> 13:51.970
I found her lying around.

13:51.970 --> 13:53.050
Perfect.

13:53.920 --> 13:56.770
If you add that healer and Demi, 
that makes twenty-four.

13:57.200 --> 13:59.140
If you want to fight something that badly,

13:59.140 --> 14:02.090
you can settle your differences with Shiroe in a raid.

14:02.930 --> 14:04.280
What are you talking about?

14:04.550 --> 14:06.280

14:06.600 --> 14:08.160

I knew William would be the commander,

15:12.440 --> 15:15.520
but I didn't think we'd be walking.

15:15.910 --> 15:18.570
I wanted to be a flying idol.

15:18.930 --> 15:20.020
Right, right.

15:20.320 --> 15:23.520
Not everyone has a griffon.

15:23.520 --> 15:26.500
And I think William has some kind of plan.

15:28.580 --> 15:30.320
We want to learn

15:30.320 --> 15:34.030
the new members' personalities and 
habits before we get there, right?

15:34.390 --> 15:38.540
But first, are we even functioning as a party?

15:42.350 --> 15:44.500
I'm tired of walking.

15:44.850 --> 15:47.890
Oh, well. I'll ride Naotsugu.

15:47.890 --> 15:50.200
Don't use me as a vehicle.

15:50.200 --> 15:53.260
You're such a tsundere. You know you love it.

15:53.260 --> 15:54.480
I do not!

15:54.940 --> 15:58.400
I'm a beautiful idol. What if my feet get callused?

15:58.400 --> 15:59.420
I don't care.

15:59.420 --> 16:01.890
The whole world would be sad.

16:01.890 --> 16:04.020
The sun wouldn't rise for three days!

16:04.440 --> 16:07.210
Then turn yourself into a snowman 
and roll everywhere.

16:07.210 --> 16:08.840
Aren't you good at getting stuck in snow?

16:08.840 --> 16:10.950
Now I'm mad!

16:11.760 --> 16:13.030
This is so easy...

16:13.330 --> 16:14.170
You little...

16:14.170 --> 16:15.600
That's a warrior's life!

16:15.600 --> 16:16.760
Wait!

16:18.020 --> 16:19.130
Hey!

16:19.780 --> 16:22.550
You guys really aren't worried, are you?

16:22.550 --> 16:24.580
We're just happy-go-lucky. That's all.

16:26.730 --> 16:29.340
Looks like he hasn't changed, though.

16:29.610 --> 16:32.010
Honestly, that worries me.

16:32.420 --> 16:34.570
But he came to the raid.

16:34.570 --> 16:35.850
I'm sure he'll understand.

16:36.680 --> 16:39.550
The other idiots and I did.

16:39.550 --> 16:43.370
And if he can't, he simply isn't that good.

16:44.540 --> 16:46.590
I can't wait!

16:46.590 --> 16:49.610
I can't wait to rip things apart.

16:49.940 --> 16:52.370
I hope we can finish it up this year.

16:52.370 --> 16:53.610
Yeah.

16:54.200 --> 16:58.370
There are all kinds of events around New Year's.

16:58.370 --> 17:03.370
<b>26 Days Until Christmas</b>

16:59.800 --> 17:01.120
I see.

17:01.120 --> 17:03.370
Sounds like you're having a rough time, Naotsugu.

17:03.600 --> 17:04.760
Yeah.

17:04.760 --> 17:06.320
You okay?

17:06.320 --> 17:08.540
That was the guy who was chasing Serara, right?

17:08.540 --> 17:10.680
That demi-glace guy.

17:10.680 --> 17:12.130
It's Demikas.

17:12.290 --> 17:15.690
Well, William has an eye on him, so he'll be fine.

17:15.690 --> 17:18.800
And his People of the Land wife 
has him on a leash, too.

17:18.800 --> 17:21.180
Really? That's hilarious.

17:22.900 --> 17:23.650
Oops.

17:23.950 --> 17:25.760
How about food?

17:25.760 --> 17:27.570
Are you eating nutritious stuff?

17:27.570 --> 17:29.160
You want chicken, right?

17:29.160 --> 17:32.220
It's crispy outside, and juicy inside!

17:32.220 --> 17:34.940
In winter, chicken is delicious!

17:34.940 --> 17:37.120
You're sure pushing chicken hard.

17:37.560 --> 17:39.170
Well, you know...

17:39.170 --> 17:41.660
Only twenty-six days until Christmas, right?

17:41.660 --> 17:42.660
Yeah.

17:42.990 --> 17:46.410
I just hope you can get back by then.

17:46.710 --> 17:48.670
Well, you know...

17:49.360 --> 17:51.700
I'll try my best, okay?

17:52.940 --> 17:53.860
Bye.

17:54.200 --> 17:57.070
Yeah, talk to you tomorrow.

17:58.890 --> 18:01.680
Marie!

18:01.960 --> 18:04.480
Having a cozy telepathy chat at a time like this?

18:04.480 --> 18:06.180
Are you supposed to be a drama heroine?

18:06.180 --> 18:10.190
Are you eventually going to say, 
"Which is more important? Me or your work?"

18:10.430 --> 18:12.850
Your imagination's a bit too active.

18:13.590 --> 18:18.680
We don't know where Minami's spies might be.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.500
That's why we put strict rules in place

18:20.500 --> 18:22.850
for talking with Shiroe and 
the others via telepathy.

18:22.850 --> 18:24.040
And yet...

18:24.040 --> 18:25.590
I know.

18:26.210 --> 18:31.480
That's why the two of us decided to only 
talk once a day, at 9:00 at night.

18:31.960 --> 18:34.070
Huh? Huh?

18:34.070 --> 18:36.120
You don't need to say "Huh?" twice.

18:36.120 --> 18:38.320
We're only discussing basic stuff.

18:38.320 --> 18:40.870
I don't even know where Naotsugu is.

18:41.580 --> 18:42.970
So you know?

18:44.070 --> 18:46.960
They're about to start a raid, right?

18:46.960 --> 18:48.540
It's live or die.

18:48.540 --> 18:49.760
Well, they won't die...

18:49.760 --> 18:52.610
They won't die, but they need a break, right?

18:53.180 --> 18:55.090
I'm not going to get in their way.

18:55.090 --> 18:59.610
It's also my job to be the liaison between 
the Crescent Moon Alliance and them.

19:00.380 --> 19:02.620
I-It's work... Work.

19:03.260 --> 19:06.440
Liaison, huh? Sure.

19:06.440 --> 19:08.120
It's fine! Right?

19:08.390 --> 19:11.380
Really, Marie, you're so...

19:11.820 --> 19:14.130
I think I'm full, too.

19:14.130 --> 19:15.600
I'm sure.

19:16.570 --> 19:19.130
You just ate, right?

19:22.440 --> 19:25.890
Why do I feel so defeated?

19:35.780 --> 19:37.400
You stay here in Akihabara, Akatsuki.

19:38.830 --> 19:41.490
I need to ask a favor that only you can do.

19:43.540 --> 19:45.770
I want you to protect Princess Lenessia.

19:49.400 --> 19:52.710
<i>There are spies from Minami in Akihabara.</i>

19:53.540 --> 19:55.890
<i>The princess might be in danger,</i>

19:55.890 --> 19:57.210
<i>so I am to protect her.</i>

19:57.820 --> 19:59.180
<i>I understand that.</i>

19:59.590 --> 20:00.220
<i>But...</i>

20:01.230 --> 20:04.220
<i>I think his real goal is something else.</i>

20:06.480 --> 20:07.420
Um...

20:08.110 --> 20:09.890
What is that?

20:09.890 --> 20:10.980
A red bean bun.

20:11.290 --> 20:12.580
Red bean bun?

20:12.970 --> 20:15.480
Then, what are you drinking?

20:16.340 --> 20:17.480
Roasted green tea.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.490
Apple tea isn't to your taste?

20:20.820 --> 20:23.740
Everyone knows red bean buns 
are best with roasted green tea.

20:24.640 --> 20:25.580
Ah...

20:28.470 --> 20:29.930
I don't understand.

20:29.930 --> 20:31.250
It's difficult, isn't it?

20:32.360 --> 20:35.910
It's been a long time since I came to this town.

20:35.910 --> 20:38.510
But there are still so many 
things I don't understand.

20:38.770 --> 20:42.030
How adventurers think, their customs...

20:44.440 --> 20:46.510
This is just my personal taste.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.710
There's nothing wrong with apple tea.

but I won't let it happen.</i>

22:25.860 --> 22:29.480
<i>I'll rip apart all your wishes!</i>

22:29.860 --> 22:34.650
<i>I'll change that stupid smirk of yours into a sob.</i>

24:06.050 --> 24:07.480
In the lowest level

24:07.480 --> 24:10.600
of the Depths of Palm lies the 
raid zone, the Abyssal Shaft.

24:10.600 --> 24:12.700
There, the full raid finally begins.

24:12.700 --> 24:14.680
As the fierce battle rages,

24:14.680 --> 24:19.020
Shiroe, William, and Demikas fight with 
their own thoughts in their hearts.

24:19.020 --> 24:22.780
And in distant Akihabara, Akatsuki is uncertain.

24:23.270 --> 24:25.250
Next time: The Abyssal Shaft.

24:23.270 --> 24:29.940
<b>The Abyssal Shaft</b>

24:25.800 --> 24:27.770
Rise up once more.
