WEBVTT

00:01.962 --> 00:03.841
- Best Sleep Inn, please.

00:03.841 --> 00:05.385
<i>Victor didn't have time</i>
<i>to clean up last night.</i>

00:05.385 --> 00:07.348
<i>He was busy rescuing</i>
<i>his princess.</i>

00:07.348 --> 00:09.728
<i>We said we weren't</i>
<i>gonna talk about last night.</i>

00:09.728 --> 00:11.607
- Checking out already?
- She actually needs

00:11.607 --> 00:13.778
to meet my mom pretty soon
since the wedding is coming up.

00:13.778 --> 00:15.657
So we need to catch a bus.

00:15.657 --> 00:17.702
<i>Does the bus station</i>
<i>have metal detectors?</i>

00:17.702 --> 00:19.540
<i>I guess.</i>

00:19.540 --> 00:21.710
- Hmm. There's just the one
ticket on this reservation.

00:21.710 --> 00:23.673
Nick Godejohn, round trip,
Big Bend to Springfield.

00:23.673 --> 00:26.302
- I thought I checked it
before I hit the button.

00:26.302 --> 00:28.431
Nick?

00:33.024 --> 00:34.074
- I'm sorry, sometimes

00:34.074 --> 00:36.114
I just don't really know
what I'm supposed to be doing.

00:36.114 --> 00:38.578
- Tell me one single thing
that you do know, Nick.

00:38.578 --> 00:40.247
- I do know one thing.

00:40.247 --> 00:42.334
That I'd pretty much always
do anything for you.

01:08.971 --> 01:12.854
- Wisconsin is so pretty.

01:12.854 --> 01:15.568
We're going to be
happy here, aren't we?

01:18.490 --> 01:20.870
I can't wait to meet your mom

01:20.870 --> 01:23.584
and just, you know,
do stuff together.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.337
And, oh, this isn't
until December,

01:25.337 --> 01:26.965
but it's
really important to me.

01:26.965 --> 01:29.345
Can we please go see
the new "Star Wars" movie

01:29.345 --> 01:31.349
as soon as it comes out?
- Mm-hmm.

01:31.349 --> 01:32.894
Yes, hon.

01:32.894 --> 01:34.146
Okay.

02:21.825 --> 02:24.831
Uh-huh. Go on.

02:28.463 --> 02:30.300
- You're beautiful.

02:37.105 --> 02:39.443
Oh, my mom's here.

02:57.939 --> 03:00.570
- You must be Gypsy.

03:00.570 --> 03:03.074
- Hi, so nice to meet you.

03:04.103 --> 03:06.235
Um, Nick's painted
such a wonderful picture

03:06.235 --> 03:08.126
of his family.

03:08.126 --> 03:11.132
- You got yourself
a chirpy one, huh, Nick?

03:43.237 --> 03:45.910
- Thank you so much
for picking us up.

03:45.910 --> 03:48.289
- Well, I'm missing
my meeting for this,

03:48.289 --> 03:50.168
but I suppose
it's better than you

03:50.168 --> 03:52.047
living in
a homeless shelter, huh?

03:52.047 --> 03:53.509
Nick says you were staying

03:53.509 --> 03:56.013
at a homeless shelter
for a few days?

03:58.142 --> 04:01.148
Uh-huh, I was, I was,

04:01.148 --> 04:04.279
and it was-- it was terrible.

04:04.279 --> 04:08.454
Um, people aren't
very friendly there.

04:08.454 --> 04:10.375
- Your mother hasn't tried
to reach out

04:10.375 --> 04:13.089
or call you or something?

04:13.089 --> 04:14.466
Look for you?

04:18.141 --> 04:20.603
- No.

04:20.603 --> 04:24.946
- Well, I never
got along with my mom
when I was younger, so...

04:26.407 --> 04:28.704
But you'll get through it,
I'm sure.

04:30.290 --> 04:33.797
Having a break for now.

04:33.797 --> 04:35.760
- Um, yeah.

04:49.913 --> 04:52.209
- Almost there.

05:12.207 --> 05:14.211
Oh, come on, guys.

05:14.211 --> 05:18.219
The cage ain't even half full.

05:18.219 --> 05:20.473
- Make yourself at home.

05:20.473 --> 05:22.645
The beer in the fridge
is Vance's.

05:22.645 --> 05:26.987
Everything else is fair game.
- That's the rules.

05:26.987 --> 05:29.909
- I'm going to go get the bags.
- Okay.

05:36.172 --> 05:38.467
Hey.

05:38.467 --> 05:40.096
Gypsy, right?

05:40.096 --> 05:42.894
- Yeah.
- Oh.

05:42.894 --> 05:46.233
You're younger
than Nick said.

05:47.570 --> 05:50.033
- I'm 23.

05:52.663 --> 05:54.249
Sit.

05:56.045 --> 05:57.632
Sit.

06:05.606 --> 06:07.067
Why don't you go in the back

06:07.067 --> 06:09.948
and grab my diet soda,
will you, babe?

06:11.660 --> 06:13.705
All right.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.170
You know it's hard
for me to move.

06:24.769 --> 06:27.817
Nick, why don't you
show Gypsy around?

06:27.817 --> 06:29.403
There's not much to see,

06:29.403 --> 06:31.574
but I'm sure it's better
than where you've been.

06:33.662 --> 06:37.294
- After you.
- Thank you. Thank you.

07:05.726 --> 07:10.109
Um, is it always
this cluttered?

07:10.109 --> 07:13.324
Well, basically,
there's a system here.

07:13.324 --> 07:16.581
So those are my rocks.
They're my clothes.

07:16.581 --> 07:19.211
Everything has a place.

07:19.211 --> 07:23.720
- And, um, what about... me?

07:23.720 --> 07:25.682
- Um, right here.

07:33.072 --> 07:34.534
Aw.

07:38.499 --> 07:42.006
This place is going to be
just fine, honey.

07:42.006 --> 07:44.679
It'll be our space.
- Mm-hmm.

07:54.740 --> 07:56.619
Where's the food?

07:56.619 --> 07:59.332
- Well, I usually get pizza
from work.

07:59.332 --> 08:02.255
Sometimes we have doughnuts
or peanut butter and jelly.

08:02.255 --> 08:05.136
But today is unfortunate.

08:05.136 --> 08:08.309
Maybe tomorrow, though.

08:08.309 --> 08:11.900
- How do you all do it?

08:11.900 --> 08:16.116
- Do what?
- Not starve.

08:17.578 --> 08:19.540
I usually get pizza from work.

08:19.540 --> 08:23.380
- Well, yeah, but...
What is wrong with her?

08:23.380 --> 08:25.510
She should be
taking care of you.

08:25.510 --> 08:28.850
It's a mother's job
to feed her child.

08:28.850 --> 08:31.188
That's what a good mother does.

08:34.402 --> 08:36.280
- We can go buy some food.

08:36.280 --> 08:39.287
I can take out money
from the nest egg.

08:39.287 --> 08:41.041
- No, no.

08:41.041 --> 08:43.462
That money is for our
future together, Nick--

08:43.462 --> 08:46.009
our wedding, our home,

08:46.009 --> 08:48.890
not pizza and doughnuts.

08:48.890 --> 08:51.395
- Okay.

08:51.395 --> 08:54.442
- Listen, if your mom's not
going to provide for us,

08:54.442 --> 08:56.488
then I will.

08:56.488 --> 08:58.868
But you'll have to help me.

08:58.868 --> 09:00.789
- Okay.

09:00.789 --> 09:03.460
Just go over there.

09:11.978 --> 09:14.441
Okay, stop right here, okay?

09:17.071 --> 09:19.409
Okay, you know
what to say, right?

09:19.409 --> 09:22.415
- Essentially, yes.

09:23.752 --> 09:28.511
- Hey, don't worry, okay?
I've done this before.

09:28.511 --> 09:30.849
You just have to believe
what you say,

09:30.849 --> 09:32.519
and they will, too.

09:32.519 --> 09:33.938
Okay?

09:33.938 --> 09:35.901
Go on.

10:06.128 --> 10:08.883
- Hi, can I help you?

10:08.883 --> 10:11.806
- Yes.

10:11.806 --> 10:13.518
Um...

10:15.438 --> 10:19.279
Do you have any of those
mechanical scooters?

10:19.279 --> 10:23.078
My fiancÃ© sprained her knee.
- Oh, sweetheart, of course.

10:23.078 --> 10:26.084
Just wait right here,
okay, hon?

10:26.084 --> 10:28.046
Let me go get that for you.

10:36.731 --> 10:40.321
- No, no.
Come on.

10:46.208 --> 10:48.128
Go down that way.

10:56.394 --> 10:58.775
You like
the garlic ones, right?

10:58.775 --> 11:00.946
- Yeah. Wait, wait.

11:04.285 --> 11:07.709
- Maybe he'll just go away.

11:19.357 --> 11:21.737
Um, excuse me.

11:21.737 --> 11:23.950
I have a condition...
- Yeah.

11:23.950 --> 11:26.204
That makes it hard for me
to find things in stores.

11:26.204 --> 11:28.668
And so I was hoping
you could show me

11:28.668 --> 11:31.381
where your soup cans
are currently.

11:31.381 --> 11:33.468
- Follow me.

12:29.247 --> 12:30.583
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

12:32.587 --> 12:35.969
- Well, I'm glad to see Nick
finally got off his butt

12:35.969 --> 12:38.432
and got you something to eat.

12:38.432 --> 12:40.687
- Nick's actually
a very good provider.

12:40.687 --> 12:43.651
He knows what I need.

12:43.651 --> 12:45.320
- Well, I knew
she'd like potatoes

12:45.320 --> 12:48.201
because that's what her mom
used to always make her.

12:48.201 --> 12:51.667
Hmm, so it wasn't
all bad, then, huh?

12:51.667 --> 12:53.671
You sure you don't want
to give her a call,

12:53.671 --> 12:55.174
maybe patch things up?

12:55.174 --> 12:57.804
- Um...

12:57.804 --> 13:02.146
I think that I'm better off
with Nick now.

13:02.146 --> 13:04.943
She's pretty hard to live with.

13:04.943 --> 13:08.450
- I saw an episode
of "Dr. Phil" once

13:08.450 --> 13:12.918
about borderline personality,
and that kind of crazy

13:12.918 --> 13:15.632
was so--
- My mom's not crazy.

13:15.632 --> 13:19.765
She just-- well, she just
couldn't take care of herself,

13:19.765 --> 13:23.271
so she just really couldn't
take care of me.

13:23.271 --> 13:26.319
- Hmm.
- Oh.

13:26.319 --> 13:28.699
That kind of thing
usually runs in the family.

13:28.699 --> 13:32.081
So look out, Nick.

13:32.081 --> 13:34.962
That's the kind of thing
Dr. Phil calls a vicious cycle.

13:34.962 --> 13:38.928
And what do you know
about Dr. Phil, Vance?

13:38.928 --> 13:41.684
- I have seen his show.
- Yeah.

13:41.684 --> 13:44.313
You never watch the show.
I watch his show.

13:44.313 --> 13:47.737
You always change it--
- My mom's not crazy.

13:48.948 --> 13:53.290
- If you say so, hon,
then she's not crazy.

13:53.290 --> 13:57.381
Well, I do say so.

13:57.381 --> 14:00.680
She used to do a lot of
nice things for me, actually.

14:00.680 --> 14:02.559
She would-- she would
get me a stuffed animal

14:02.559 --> 14:05.105
every time I had
to go to the doctor.

14:05.105 --> 14:08.905
- That's cool.
I saw--

14:08.905 --> 14:10.992
- And we used to go to
these conventions together,

14:10.992 --> 14:14.206
and we would always dress up,
and it was so much fun.

14:14.206 --> 14:16.210
And one time, we met Wolverine.

14:16.210 --> 14:19.551
And anytime I'd ever
get sad or lonely,

14:19.551 --> 14:22.807
she would always sing me
my favorite song.

14:22.807 --> 14:25.772
What-- what did you put in this?
It tastes weird.

14:25.772 --> 14:29.195
- I just followed
the instructions.

14:29.195 --> 14:32.159
- Do you remember the last time
we had mashed potatoes

14:32.159 --> 14:34.288
at the O'Neil's barbecue?

14:34.288 --> 14:38.714
And Nick left raw
hamburger meat in the trunk.

14:38.714 --> 14:42.054
Oh, my--
I remember that, right?

14:42.054 --> 14:45.310
Because next week,
I'm driving down by Manitowoc,

14:45.310 --> 14:48.609
and I'm thinking to myself,
"What's that smell?"

14:48.609 --> 14:50.863
You know what happens
when you leave a pound

14:50.863 --> 14:53.995
of raw hamburger meat
in a car in the summertime?

14:57.001 --> 14:59.046
Take a guess what happens.

15:12.699 --> 15:14.447
- Are you okay?
- Um...

15:15.580 --> 15:17.625
I'm okay.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.378
Could you just
get me some medicine

15:19.378 --> 15:21.090
to settle my tummy, please?

15:21.090 --> 15:24.430
- Um....
We don't have any medicine.

15:24.430 --> 15:25.975
- What?

15:25.975 --> 15:29.315
Not even Pepto-Bismol or--

15:33.783 --> 15:36.245
- Hon?

15:36.245 --> 15:37.950
I want to go home.

15:39.210 --> 15:40.671
- We're already here.

15:42.842 --> 15:46.850
- No, no, I mean
my real home in Springfield.

15:49.271 --> 15:52.194
- I-I don't think
that we can go back there...

15:52.194 --> 15:54.448
really, ever.

15:54.448 --> 15:56.703
- Well, maybe we can.

15:56.703 --> 15:59.584
We just have to make sure
that someone finds her body,

15:59.584 --> 16:01.379
and then
the house will be empty.

16:01.379 --> 16:02.757
And then
we can tell the police

16:02.757 --> 16:04.511
that it was someone else

16:04.511 --> 16:07.474
and then you and I can go back
and live there, right?

16:07.474 --> 16:10.438
- Someone else didn't do it.
It was us.

16:11.650 --> 16:13.821
- Well, we can't
just leave her there.

16:13.821 --> 16:16.242
We have to tell someone
she's there.

16:25.260 --> 16:28.809
- We can't call the police,
sweetheart.

16:28.809 --> 16:32.274
- Well, we have
to do something.

16:32.274 --> 16:35.615
We can't just
let her sit there.

16:35.615 --> 16:37.535
- I know what we can do.

16:39.205 --> 16:41.209
Now when you post something,
it'll show up here,

16:41.209 --> 16:43.004
where all of her friends
can see it.

16:43.004 --> 16:44.966
Maybe they'll go find her.

16:47.847 --> 16:49.601
- Like this?
Like...

16:57.700 --> 16:59.286
- It might be too vague,
because, like,

16:59.286 --> 17:02.627
what if she just needs help
mowing her lawn?

17:02.627 --> 17:04.506
- Oh.

17:22.332 --> 17:24.628
I don't know.

17:24.628 --> 17:28.428
It's missing something.
Don't you think, like--

17:29.931 --> 17:33.104
Like, what would a real,
like, murderer say?

18:00.200 --> 18:01.953
That's it.

18:04.291 --> 18:07.882
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, how was your day?

18:07.882 --> 18:10.053
- Long.

18:15.438 --> 18:17.359
Ooh.

18:18.779 --> 18:20.198
Want to test it?

18:20.198 --> 18:22.912
- Yeah, I'm starving.
You know it.

18:22.912 --> 18:25.291
I didn't even get a chance
to eat lunch today.

18:28.799 --> 18:30.594
Hmm.

18:38.443 --> 18:40.196
- What's wrong?

18:47.043 --> 18:49.591
Everything okay?
- Uh, hold on.

18:53.181 --> 18:55.310
Hey, Mom.

18:55.310 --> 18:57.439
Hey, did-- did you see that post

18:57.439 --> 19:00.403
on-on Dee Dee
and-and Gypsy's Facebook page?

19:02.700 --> 19:06.123
Yeah, no, no, just-- just go
to their Facebook page.

19:08.419 --> 19:10.800
Okay, you know what?
I'm-- I'm just gonna come over.

19:17.062 --> 19:18.816
What are these comments?
They're not finding her.

19:18.816 --> 19:20.861
It's not working.
Just-- they're not getting it.

19:20.861 --> 19:22.949
- Maybe it's just going
to take some time.

19:22.949 --> 19:26.163
- We don't have time.
She's just sitting there.

19:26.163 --> 19:28.710
I don't want to leave her
there like that.

19:30.255 --> 19:33.135
We have to...

19:33.135 --> 19:34.973
we have to grab
their attention.

19:46.078 --> 19:49.084
No, no, no, no, no.

19:49.084 --> 19:51.965
Words like that, it's--

19:51.965 --> 19:53.927
See, that's something
that you would say, right?

19:53.927 --> 19:56.600
- Right.
- Right, yes.

19:56.600 --> 19:58.562
What would Victor say?

20:41.438 --> 20:43.317
- Are you sure?

20:48.035 --> 20:50.498
- There.

20:50.498 --> 20:53.087
- You turned off the location
before you sent that, right?

20:55.926 --> 20:57.555
- What?

20:59.474 --> 21:02.523
Everybody that knows
them is freaking out on here.

21:13.628 --> 21:14.964
Dee Dee?

21:21.918 --> 21:25.694
Dee, Gypsy?
You guys okay in there?

21:37.551 --> 21:40.516
- Their car is still here.

21:40.516 --> 21:44.189
Mom, I'm just going
to call the cops, okay?

21:44.189 --> 21:45.776
- Yeah.

21:48.698 --> 21:51.996
- It's probably no big deal,
because most people

21:51.996 --> 21:55.504
don't even know
that Facebook has tracking.

21:55.504 --> 21:57.382
Everyone's going to think
that whoever did this

21:57.382 --> 21:59.010
is still in Springfield.

22:04.020 --> 22:06.860
- I was arrested once, and...

22:06.860 --> 22:08.864
it was basically
for a misunderstanding.

22:08.864 --> 22:11.619
The cops who took my computer
couldn't even find

22:11.619 --> 22:13.915
my browser history
without help.

22:13.915 --> 22:17.548
- What kind
of misunderstanding?

22:17.548 --> 22:19.217
- Um, it-- it was just stupid.

22:19.217 --> 22:22.348
What I'm trying to say is
we're going to be okay.

22:30.031 --> 22:31.826
It's pretty much dinnertime.

22:31.826 --> 22:33.622
Let's just go downstairs,

22:33.622 --> 22:36.920
and maybe my mom
brought home something good.

23:12.365 --> 23:14.662
Shit.

23:14.662 --> 23:16.916
Oof.

23:16.916 --> 23:19.880
It's the North fucking Pole
in here, right?

23:48.897 --> 23:50.316
Anything?

23:55.242 --> 23:57.998
Well, you say you will,
and then you don't.

23:57.998 --> 24:01.672
- Because I'm tired of driving
back and forth down there.

24:01.672 --> 24:04.637
- All right.
- It's chicken night?

24:04.637 --> 24:08.603
- Yeah, you can grab
two pieces.

24:08.603 --> 24:10.398
- Mmm, it looks delicious.
Thank you.

24:10.398 --> 24:14.239
- It sure beats only
mashed potatoes, huh?

24:14.239 --> 24:18.581
- Oh, hey, Nick, you got a
package addressed to you here.

24:20.042 --> 24:21.712
Um...

24:21.712 --> 24:25.136
that's ours.
I'll just take it.

24:28.058 --> 24:30.479
What--

24:30.479 --> 24:33.528
- I don't open
other people's mail.

24:40.542 --> 24:43.172
- Um, Nick?

24:44.967 --> 24:49.894
You want to maybe help me
put this where it belongs?

24:49.894 --> 24:51.104
Remember?

24:52.774 --> 24:54.945
Where no one else can find it.

24:54.945 --> 24:57.200
- But it's chicken night.

24:58.536 --> 25:02.210
- But the-- the chicken
can wait, right?

25:04.297 --> 25:07.513
- Well, not really,
because then it will get cold.

25:32.771 --> 25:36.194
- W-where's the lake?
- Um, what?

25:36.194 --> 25:37.823
- The lake?

25:37.823 --> 25:40.452
Hello? We're supposed
to put this in the lake.

25:40.452 --> 25:43.585
- Sure. Right, yeah,
we can absolutely do that.

25:43.585 --> 25:46.882
But it's kind of dark outside,
so maybe we can do it tomorrow?

25:46.882 --> 25:48.427
- What?

25:48.427 --> 25:50.097
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

25:50.097 --> 25:51.684
Dark is what we want

25:51.684 --> 25:53.437
for getting rid
of something like this.

25:53.437 --> 25:55.190
Dark is good, right?

25:55.190 --> 25:56.736
You have to think
about this stuff.

25:56.736 --> 25:58.280
You have to really think
about this stuff.

25:58.280 --> 26:00.242
We have to think
about getting rid of this

26:00.242 --> 26:03.583
and maybe-- maybe even
getting out of here.

26:03.583 --> 26:06.839
Right?

26:06.839 --> 26:09.887
- Darling, I... um...

26:09.887 --> 26:11.431
Darling?
Darling, what?

26:11.431 --> 26:13.185
Nick, Nick, what
are you going to say?

26:13.185 --> 26:17.903
This is supposed to be
our new life together,

26:17.903 --> 26:19.948
and I keep-- I keep waiting

26:19.948 --> 26:22.913
for this
happily ever after to start.

26:22.913 --> 26:26.252
But it's not starting.
We're just-- we're stuck

26:26.252 --> 26:31.012
in this-- in this
weird mess with this!

26:31.012 --> 26:33.475
I'm trying to get us free.

26:40.280 --> 26:42.869
No. No, no, none of that!

26:42.869 --> 26:44.581
No more, 'cause you need
to focus on me.

26:44.581 --> 26:45.875
- Nick?

26:45.875 --> 26:48.296
Are you okay?

26:48.296 --> 26:50.885
Why don't you two
both come inside?

26:58.526 --> 27:01.197
- Just go.
- Okay.

27:13.598 --> 27:17.188
- What about Gypsy?
Where is Gypsy?

27:33.261 --> 27:37.478
- Gina.
- Hey, welcome to the party.

27:37.478 --> 27:39.357
- Do you want some privacy
while you change into those?

27:39.357 --> 27:41.027
- Oh, very funny.

27:41.027 --> 27:44.075
They, uh, tracked
the Facebook posts.

27:44.075 --> 27:46.747
Southern Big Bend, Wisconsin.

27:46.747 --> 27:48.960
- Wisconsin?
- Yeah.

27:51.590 --> 27:55.138
Who's in Wisconsin?

27:55.138 --> 27:56.391
Let's find out.

28:28.789 --> 28:30.835
What time is it?

28:34.593 --> 28:36.513
"Open doors for her.

28:36.513 --> 28:41.064
"Call her 'darling'
and 'sweetheart.'

28:41.064 --> 28:42.984
Feed her"?

28:42.984 --> 28:46.282
Lists help me remember things.

28:52.921 --> 28:55.593
- Nick...

28:55.593 --> 28:58.808
I don't know,
I just feel like--

29:13.796 --> 29:15.758
- Crap.
- Oh, my God.

29:21.269 --> 29:22.939
- They know.
Is there-- Are we--

29:22.939 --> 29:25.862
Do they-- do they know that
we're here, you think?

29:25.862 --> 29:28.283
Um, oh, I can't breathe.

29:28.283 --> 29:30.370
Um, I can't--

29:30.370 --> 29:31.915
Nick, can we go out the window?

29:31.915 --> 29:34.336
Hey, Nick, listen to me!
Can we go out the window?

29:34.336 --> 29:35.757
- No, it's been nailed shut

29:35.757 --> 29:37.342
ever since
I tried to jump out of it.

29:37.342 --> 29:39.096
- Um...

29:39.096 --> 29:41.518
Okay, come with me! Come here.
Listen, listen to me.

29:41.518 --> 29:43.146
It's going to be fine.
It's going to be fine.

29:43.146 --> 29:45.358
Just come with me.
Okay, come here, come here.

29:48.448 --> 29:51.747
No! Shh. Shh.
Be quiet, be quiet.

29:51.747 --> 29:54.711
Nick, get in.
Get in, close it.

29:54.711 --> 29:58.384
Close your side.
Close your-- Okay.

30:01.934 --> 30:03.687
Eyes up, eyes up!

30:03.687 --> 30:05.858
Jackson approaching obstacle.

30:08.196 --> 30:10.450
Attention, attention.

30:10.450 --> 30:12.664
This is the Waukesha County
Sheriff's Department.

30:12.664 --> 30:14.751
We have the house surrounded.

30:14.751 --> 30:16.880
Everyone come out...
nice and slow,

30:16.880 --> 30:19.511
hands open and in the air
where we can see them.

30:19.511 --> 30:21.723
This is
the Sheriff's department.

30:21.723 --> 30:23.519
Oh, my God.

30:28.529 --> 30:29.906
- You talking to us?

30:29.906 --> 30:31.702
Come out of the house.

30:31.702 --> 30:35.250
- I'm doing what he says.
I didn't do anything wrong.

30:35.250 --> 30:38.591
- Nice and slow,
hands where we can see them.

30:38.591 --> 30:40.176
- I--
- Nice and slow,

30:40.176 --> 30:41.555
hands where we can see them.

30:41.555 --> 30:43.893
Lie on your stomachs
and be still.

30:50.907 --> 30:52.284
- Don't-- don't worry.

30:52.284 --> 30:54.121
My mom's gonna
get rid of them.

30:54.121 --> 30:56.083
She doesn't like cops.
- Okay.

30:56.083 --> 30:59.633
- We just have to stay here
and be quiet.

31:03.181 --> 31:07.105
- What if they find us?
- They won't.

31:07.105 --> 31:09.569
We're going to get out of here,
and we're going to get married

31:09.569 --> 31:12.240
and be together forever,
just like Bonnie and Clyde.

31:13.744 --> 31:16.040
Okay.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.794
Ma'am, this is your house?

31:17.794 --> 31:19.589
- Yes, sir.
- What's going on here?

31:19.589 --> 31:21.927
What--
- Quiet!

31:21.927 --> 31:23.931
Is Nicholas Godejohn your son?

31:23.931 --> 31:25.851
- What the hell
is going on here?

31:25.851 --> 31:29.358
- Answer the question, ma'am.
Is Nicholas Godejohn your son?

31:29.358 --> 31:31.947
- What did he do?
- Is Nicholas inside?

31:31.947 --> 31:35.579
- Yes, with his girlfriend.
- Is that Gypsy?

31:35.579 --> 31:38.209
- Yes, but they were--
- Did he carry her in?

31:38.209 --> 31:39.461
Was she under duress?

31:39.461 --> 31:40.965
- What? No.
- Huh--

31:40.965 --> 31:44.597
- She wasn't-- she walked
right in the front door.

31:44.597 --> 31:47.562
I need you to tell me
right now what is going on.

31:47.562 --> 31:49.607
- She walked?
- Yes.

31:49.607 --> 31:51.945
She walked in the front door.

31:51.945 --> 31:53.866
Tell them we believe
we've located Gypsy.

31:53.866 --> 31:55.285
We'll be back to verify.

31:55.285 --> 31:57.247
Are there any weapons
in the house?

31:57.247 --> 31:59.418
- Yes, sir, my hunting rifle

31:59.418 --> 32:01.798
is in-- in the closet
in the bedroom.

32:01.798 --> 32:04.303
- Is it loaded?
- No.

32:04.303 --> 32:08.604
The ammunition is-- is--
it's sitting right next to it.

32:08.604 --> 32:10.398
- Listen here.

32:10.398 --> 32:13.112
My son has mental issues, so...

32:13.112 --> 32:15.241
- He's a good boy.
- Whatever he did,

32:15.241 --> 32:16.620
he didn't do it on purpose.

32:16.620 --> 32:17.997
He's harmless.

32:17.997 --> 32:19.626
- Stay put.

32:19.626 --> 32:21.630
<i>Breach, breach, breach.</i>

32:21.630 --> 32:23.341
<i>Moving in.</i>

32:23.341 --> 32:25.011
<i>- Alpha team, left.</i>
<i>- Copy.</i>

32:25.011 --> 32:26.430
<i>Bravo team,</i>
<i>move to the right.</i>

32:26.430 --> 32:27.892
<i>Copy.</i>

32:27.892 --> 32:29.854
<i>Watch those corners.</i>

32:29.854 --> 32:31.440
<i>Front clear.</i>

32:31.440 --> 32:33.236
<i>- Corner?</i>
<i>- Clear.</i>

32:33.236 --> 32:35.031
<i>Living room clear.</i>

32:35.031 --> 32:36.660
<i>Clear.</i>

32:36.660 --> 32:38.246
<i>Alpha team breaking the wall.</i>

32:38.246 --> 32:39.708
<i>Copy that.</i>

32:39.708 --> 32:43.464
- Listen.
You saved me, right?

32:44.676 --> 32:47.430
Right?

32:47.430 --> 32:50.145
I was held prisoner,
and you saved me.

32:50.145 --> 32:52.525
<i>Clear.</i>

32:55.071 --> 32:57.242
- You saved me.
- I saved you.

32:57.242 --> 33:02.043
- You did, and all we have
to do is tell them the truth,

33:02.043 --> 33:04.674
'cause we didn't do
anything wrong, sweetie.

33:04.674 --> 33:07.638
We didn't do anything wrong.
You are a hero.

33:07.638 --> 33:10.059
- I'm a hero.
- You are my hero.

33:10.059 --> 33:11.688
- I'm a hero.

33:15.696 --> 33:17.282
<i>Weapon neutralized.</i>

33:17.282 --> 33:19.077
- You're my hero.

33:20.789 --> 33:24.923
Nicholas Godejohn!
Come out with your hands up!

33:24.923 --> 33:28.012
It's okay, it's okay.

33:30.684 --> 33:33.649
- We are coming up
in five seconds.

33:33.649 --> 33:36.111
Don't do anything stupid.

33:36.111 --> 33:38.241
- Just tell them the truth.

33:38.241 --> 33:41.121
Remember, we're in the right.
Do exactly what you said.

33:57.738 --> 33:59.742
Get out of there!

33:59.742 --> 34:01.120
Hands--
hands on your face!

34:01.120 --> 34:02.540
Do it now!

34:02.540 --> 34:03.834
Hands on your face!

34:03.834 --> 34:06.088
Step out. Do it now!

34:06.088 --> 34:07.717
Step out now!

34:07.717 --> 34:09.887
- Step out!
- Step out!

34:49.592 --> 34:52.222
Hi.

34:52.222 --> 34:55.353
Gypsy, I'm Detective Crawford.
How are you today?

34:55.353 --> 34:58.192
- I'm doing good.
- Good, good.

34:58.192 --> 35:01.156
Here, I know it can get
kind of chilly in here.

35:01.156 --> 35:03.035
- Thank you.

35:03.035 --> 35:05.791
I drove all the way
from Springfield to see you.

35:09.047 --> 35:10.592
Okay.

35:10.592 --> 35:14.141
Gypsy, uh, you need
to be honest with me,

35:14.141 --> 35:16.563
and if you're involved
in anything

35:16.563 --> 35:18.190
that I'm about ready
to tell you,

35:18.190 --> 35:20.738
you need to tell me, all right?

35:20.738 --> 35:23.284
- Absolutely.
- All right.

35:23.284 --> 35:26.875
Your mom is dead, okay?

35:26.875 --> 35:28.419
And what I want to ask you--

35:28.419 --> 35:30.799
- Wait.
Wha-- what? What? What?

35:32.385 --> 35:35.601
- Your mom's passed away, okay?

35:35.601 --> 35:38.481
She's deceased, all right?

35:38.481 --> 35:41.403
And what I want to ask you...

35:41.403 --> 35:44.619
Hon, were you involved in this?

35:44.619 --> 35:48.417
- No. No. No, I--

35:48.417 --> 35:51.423
Okay. Okay.

35:53.678 --> 35:57.101
Just listen to me now
for a second, all right?

35:57.101 --> 36:01.528
Gypsy, what happened
with your mom that night?

36:01.528 --> 36:04.074
- Um...

36:05.994 --> 36:08.499
I don't know what happened
with my mom at all.

36:08.499 --> 36:10.127
- Okay.
- Help me, please.

36:10.127 --> 36:13.259
- All right, sweetheart,
just listen, okay?

36:13.259 --> 36:16.516
You know what happened
with your mom,

36:16.516 --> 36:18.435
and I know you know.

36:22.068 --> 36:24.239
- You think that it's me?

36:24.239 --> 36:25.826
Why would you think
that it's me?

36:25.826 --> 36:27.872
I have always loved my mom.

36:27.872 --> 36:29.416
My mom and I are best friends.

36:29.416 --> 36:33.132
- Sweetheart, don't dig yourself
in a hole like this.

36:33.132 --> 36:34.886
Please.

36:37.140 --> 36:40.146
- Come on, now.
- I really love my mom.

36:40.146 --> 36:42.150
- I know you do.
- Please.

36:42.150 --> 36:44.989
- Gypsy, I know
you love your mom.

36:44.989 --> 36:46.826
Please.

36:46.826 --> 36:49.790
Gypsy, I know
that you love your mom.

36:49.790 --> 36:52.211
I have no doubt
that you loved your mom,

36:52.211 --> 36:55.552
but now is the time
to be honest, all right?

36:55.552 --> 37:00.896
No more lies.
Did you kill your mom?

37:02.691 --> 37:04.695
- No, no, sir.

37:05.906 --> 37:08.870
- The truth is...

37:08.870 --> 37:12.920
Okay, I'll admit it.
I did actually...

37:12.920 --> 37:15.007
stab her mom.

37:15.007 --> 37:17.136
I'll admit it.
- Okay.

37:17.136 --> 37:19.517
The only reason I did is
'cause I did it for me and her.

37:19.517 --> 37:20.769
That's the real reason
I did it.

37:20.769 --> 37:22.230
I would never have did it

37:22.230 --> 37:24.944
if it was not for me and her.
- Okay.

37:24.944 --> 37:26.948
- See, her mom wanted
everybody to think

37:26.948 --> 37:29.244
that she was, like, 16
the entire time.

37:29.244 --> 37:32.250
So, yeah.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.547
She felt...

37:34.547 --> 37:37.301
kind of trapped
on a wheelchair.

37:38.722 --> 37:41.978
I saved her.
- You saved her?

37:41.978 --> 37:44.149
- Well...

37:44.149 --> 37:46.278
honestly...

37:46.278 --> 37:49.367
there's actually multiple
personalities of myself.

37:49.367 --> 37:51.581
- Have you ever been diagnosed
with that?

37:51.581 --> 37:52.791
- I probably should be
diagnosed with it,

37:52.791 --> 37:55.296
because it happens.

37:55.296 --> 37:58.343
The thing is,
I used to take medication.

37:58.343 --> 38:00.599
I used to hear voices
in my head.

38:00.599 --> 38:04.565
Then it went away, and then,
somehow, it's a part of myself.

38:09.032 --> 38:11.579
- Does Gypsy know that?

38:11.579 --> 38:15.086
- Uh, yes, she does know that.

38:15.086 --> 38:17.966
Did Gypsy know that you
were gonna kill her mother?

38:20.346 --> 38:24.270
- Um, honestly...

38:24.270 --> 38:26.191
she asked me to.

38:30.534 --> 38:33.205
We're going to have
a family together.

38:33.205 --> 38:36.002
We're gonna build
a life together and stuff.

38:38.508 --> 38:40.386
I love her.

38:43.518 --> 38:46.732
Well, the last doctor
that we talked to

38:46.732 --> 38:49.070
said he'd probably
always have the mind

38:49.070 --> 38:52.034
of a 15-, 16-year-old,

38:52.034 --> 38:55.207
somewhere around there.

38:55.207 --> 38:58.882
- And what did you think
about Gypsy?

38:58.882 --> 39:00.844
- Well, it was weird,

39:00.844 --> 39:04.100
'cause when I picked
them up at the bus station,

39:04.100 --> 39:06.731
I even asked about her mother.

39:06.731 --> 39:08.902
"How's your mother doing?
How is--"

39:08.902 --> 39:13.368
'Cause I was told that um, she was
staying at a homeless shelter

39:13.368 --> 39:15.707
and that her mother
had kicked her out.

39:15.707 --> 39:19.632
So I asked how her mom
was doing,

39:19.632 --> 39:21.051
no big deal.

39:21.051 --> 39:24.975
And they acted like nothing...

39:24.975 --> 39:28.942
- You know the package she got?
The one she mailed to him?

39:28.942 --> 39:31.279
That was the knife.

39:31.279 --> 39:33.075
- What?

39:33.075 --> 39:37.208
- They mailed it from their
house there to your house.

39:37.208 --> 39:39.672
- Are you serious?

39:39.672 --> 39:42.426
Yes, ma'am.

39:42.426 --> 39:46.268
- Oh, my God.
- And the Facebook posts--

39:46.268 --> 39:48.564
"I slashed her.
I killed her."

39:48.564 --> 39:50.902
They were posted
from your upstairs.

39:50.902 --> 39:54.075
- My God.

39:54.075 --> 39:57.164
The way the girl acted...

39:57.164 --> 39:59.795
I mean, if you had done
something like that

39:59.795 --> 40:04.095
to your own mother
and you lost your mother...

40:04.095 --> 40:06.726
and just to act like that...

40:06.726 --> 40:09.857
la-di-da.

40:09.857 --> 40:14.616
I'm sorry, I'm s-still trying
to wrap my head around this.

40:14.616 --> 40:17.956
But what I saw was
just two normal people.

40:17.956 --> 40:20.587
I mean, that's the way
this works, though,

40:20.587 --> 40:22.465
when you have what he has.

40:22.465 --> 40:26.766
Your mind just focuses
on one thing.

40:26.766 --> 40:30.690
But for him to ruin
his life like that...

40:33.111 --> 40:36.409
I'm sorry, but that girl
is a beast.

40:36.409 --> 40:38.790
And is she at least
trying to say,

40:38.790 --> 40:41.545
"Okay, I did this, too,"

40:41.545 --> 40:44.968
or is she trying
to pin it all on Nick?

40:44.968 --> 40:48.350
- She's not taking
much responsibility.

40:48.350 --> 40:50.145
Not much at all.

40:50.145 --> 40:53.151
Oh, crap.

40:53.151 --> 40:56.408
I thought when he got the job
at the pizza place,

40:56.408 --> 41:00.124
things were really
turning around for him.

41:00.124 --> 41:02.587
Did you have sex
with Dee Dee?

41:02.587 --> 41:04.758
- Mm, no.

41:04.758 --> 41:06.887
Did you stick your penis
anywhere on her?

41:06.887 --> 41:08.181
- Nope.
- Are you sure?

41:08.181 --> 41:09.350
- Yeah.
- Positive?

41:09.350 --> 41:11.104
- I'm 100% positive.

41:11.104 --> 41:13.734
- Did you kiss her or lick her
or anything like that?

41:13.734 --> 41:15.905
Nope.

41:15.905 --> 41:17.366
- What do you think
about people

41:17.366 --> 41:20.414
who have sex with dead bodies?

41:20.414 --> 41:23.003
- I mean, it's
quite disturbing, honestly.

41:23.003 --> 41:24.715
That would bother you?

41:24.715 --> 41:27.804
- Yeah, I don't like
necrophilia.

41:27.804 --> 41:32.021
- Okay, I just have to ask
because of your record.

41:32.021 --> 41:35.194
- That was a misunderstanding.

41:35.194 --> 41:36.989
So you weren't masturbating

41:36.989 --> 41:38.993
while you were watching
online porn at a McDonald's

41:38.993 --> 41:40.788
for nine hours?

41:40.788 --> 41:43.293
- Not as such.

41:43.293 --> 41:46.174
Did you help Nicholas
kill your mom?

41:46.174 --> 41:48.220
- No, sir.

41:48.220 --> 41:51.142
- Did you know that Nick
was going to kill your mom?

41:51.142 --> 41:52.979
- No, sir.

41:57.989 --> 41:59.993
Okay.

42:20.492 --> 42:22.581
- Rest in peace, Dee Dee.

42:25.210 --> 42:28.049
Jesus.

42:28.049 --> 42:30.513
What the hell's Gypsy
gonna do without her?

42:55.479 --> 42:56.899
- Okay.

42:56.899 --> 42:58.527
Here we go.

42:58.527 --> 43:01.617
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

43:01.617 --> 43:05.123
So, Gypsy, um...

43:05.123 --> 43:06.627
have you had a chance to think

43:06.627 --> 43:08.547
any more
about what we talked about?

43:08.547 --> 43:11.177
- Um, which part?

43:11.177 --> 43:13.641
- Well, what happened
to your mom,

43:13.641 --> 43:16.062
what Nick did to your mom.

43:16.062 --> 43:18.984
Um...

43:18.984 --> 43:22.659
I'm just still trying
to understand in my head.

43:24.286 --> 43:26.583
I just can't
believe that she's really gone.

43:26.583 --> 43:29.422
Okay, but you didn't
think of anything new, huh?

43:29.422 --> 43:31.510
Anything you
might have remembered

43:31.510 --> 43:33.889
about your involvement in that?

43:33.889 --> 43:35.560
- No, sir.

43:37.271 --> 43:40.068
- Well...

43:40.068 --> 43:41.947
that's that.

43:44.285 --> 43:46.749
- Um, Detective Crawford?
- Yeah?

43:48.334 --> 43:50.882
- Will I be able to go see
the new "Star Wars" movie

43:50.882 --> 43:52.092
when it comes out?

43:52.092 --> 43:54.096
- We'll see.

44:53.256 --> 44:55.343
- Okay, good morning.

44:55.343 --> 44:57.180
First off...

44:57.180 --> 45:00.521
<i>we have located</i>
<i>Gypsy Rose Blanchard.</i>

45:00.521 --> 45:03.986
<i>She is safe and unharmed.</i>

45:03.986 --> 45:05.656
- So she's okay.

45:05.656 --> 45:07.326
<i>And I want to specify</i>

45:07.326 --> 45:09.623
this is an
ongoing investigation,

45:09.623 --> 45:14.633
and I want to say that things
are not always as they appear.

45:14.633 --> 45:16.637
- What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

45:16.637 --> 45:18.766
<i>Sheriff, can you</i>
<i>elaborate on what you said?</i>

45:18.766 --> 45:20.603
<i>What's your statement.</i>

45:32.585 --> 45:34.798
She can walk?

45:38.681 --> 45:41.728
Son of a bitch.

45:59.639 --> 46:02.729
- The state's case against
Gypsy Rose Blanchard.

46:02.729 --> 46:04.566
This individual is alleged
to have conspired

46:04.566 --> 46:07.029
with Nicholas Godejohn
to stab her mother to death

46:07.029 --> 46:08.406
so they could be together.

46:08.406 --> 46:11.454
Penalty is life imprisonment
or death.
