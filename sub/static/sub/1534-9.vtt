00:02.415 --> 00:05.355
It's a magical storybook
which we're all written into.

00:05.463 --> 00:07.985
This book, could change
Regina's future for the better.

00:08.010 --> 00:10.380
Ingrid.
She locked me in here.

00:10.385 --> 00:11.680
We're going to sneak you
out of here,

00:11.686 --> 00:14.158
and then steal back the urn
and then trap her inside it.

00:14.325 --> 00:15.513
I can help you.

00:16.024 --> 00:16.825
Henry!

00:16.843 --> 00:19.077
<i>My magic is hurting people, Gold.
People I love.</i>

00:19.202 --> 00:20.507
I need you
to help me control it.

00:20.513 --> 00:21.808
You meet me here at sundown.

00:21.856 --> 00:23.223
I'll have averything prepared.

00:23.589 --> 00:25.044
Remember the urn?

00:25.069 --> 00:26.979
<i>It had the power
to limit your magic.</i>

00:27.004 --> 00:28.489
<i>The dust won't last long.</i>

00:28.495 --> 00:32.531
<i>When I escape,
there will be a terrible price to pay.</i>

01:01.804 --> 01:03.681
He looks peaceful.

01:03.695 --> 01:06.019
Though you should probably
look into hiring some new guards

01:06.020 --> 01:07.132
when this is all over.

01:07.558 --> 01:08.412
Smart.

01:08.925 --> 01:12.361
Now, are you sure you're
gonna be okay down here?

01:12.395 --> 01:14.564
Yes, it's not as bad as it looks,

01:14.598 --> 01:16.513
except for the dankness and
the darkness and the mice...

01:16.533 --> 01:18.835
Who are cute, when they're
not scurrying over your toes.

01:18.869 --> 01:20.837
But I have shoes.

01:20.871 --> 01:22.204
I promise, I'll be fine.

01:22.238 --> 01:23.839
And I promise I won't be long.

01:23.873 --> 01:25.640
As soon as I return to the palace,

01:25.675 --> 01:27.608
I'll tell Ingrid you're to be banished

01:27.642 --> 01:30.144
and that she's to see to
your punishment personally.

01:30.179 --> 01:32.646
Then when she comes down here,
I'll surprise her with the urn.

01:32.681 --> 01:34.648
Not like a party... "surprise!"

01:34.683 --> 01:39.087
Something more dour to match
the occasion, like, "surprise."

01:39.121 --> 01:41.422
What if something goes wrong?

01:41.457 --> 01:43.324
I should come down here,
too, just in case.

01:43.359 --> 01:45.158
No, you need to be as
far away as possible.

01:45.193 --> 01:48.428
We don't want you getting
trapped in the urn by mistake.

01:48.463 --> 01:49.763
Please don't worry.

01:49.798 --> 01:52.766
I promise... everything
is going to be fine.

02:45.285 --> 02:47.453
Surprise!

02:47.487 --> 02:49.221
How was that?

02:49.256 --> 02:50.846
I'd have done it different.

02:51.053 --> 02:52.798
Well, I'm afraid you
won't get the chance.

02:52.799 --> 02:53.908
You see, I was hoping

02:53.909 --> 02:55.629
that Elsa would believe
the lies I told her,

02:55.630 --> 02:58.432
but I knew I had to be
ready in case she didn't.

02:58.464 --> 02:59.497
It doesn't matter.

02:59.532 --> 03:01.733
You'll never turn us
against each other.

03:01.768 --> 03:06.471
"Never." That's a strong word.

03:20.553 --> 03:22.420
Emma.

03:22.455 --> 03:23.621
Stay back.

03:23.655 --> 03:26.457
Wherever you're headed,
turn around and go home.

03:26.491 --> 03:28.292
You are in great danger.

03:28.326 --> 03:30.595
Gonna listen to you about
danger? Get out of my way.

03:30.629 --> 03:33.898
My sweet girl, I am not the
one that you should fear.

03:33.932 --> 03:35.199
Rumplestiltskin is.

03:35.233 --> 03:37.267
Whatever he's promised
you, it's a lie.

03:37.302 --> 03:39.470
How do you know he
promised me anything?

03:39.504 --> 03:41.638
So I was right.

03:41.672 --> 03:45.142
You mustn't trust him, Emma.

03:45.176 --> 03:47.311
He doesn't do anything
unless it benefits him.

03:47.345 --> 03:48.412
He doesn't care about you.

03:48.446 --> 03:49.821
He would kill you to
get what he desires.

03:49.847 --> 03:51.648
You know what I think?

03:51.682 --> 03:53.817
The fact that you don't
want me to go means something.

03:53.851 --> 03:55.319
It means I'm going.

03:55.353 --> 03:57.988
I won't let you.

03:58.022 --> 04:01.157
You're not gonna hurt me. You need me.

04:01.191 --> 04:03.026
Don't do this.

04:03.060 --> 04:04.327
What the...?

04:05.395 --> 04:06.596
You're not here.

04:08.232 --> 04:10.834
If I could be, I would.

04:10.868 --> 04:14.069
I'm trying to protect
you, and that is the truth.

04:14.104 --> 04:15.838
I don't care what you
say. That's the truth.

04:45.022 --> 04:47.226
How's Henry?

04:47.227 --> 04:49.194
Reading comic books.
Refusing to sleep.

04:49.229 --> 04:51.029
So, I think okay.

04:52.236 --> 04:54.859
Or at least his version
of a brave face.

04:56.692 --> 04:59.627
Thank you, by the way, for earlier.

04:59.661 --> 05:01.729
He has enough problems

05:01.763 --> 05:04.732
without bringing my
mess of a life into it.

05:04.766 --> 05:09.069
By "mess," do you mean Robin Hood?

05:09.104 --> 05:10.670
Did you guys, uh...

05:12.107 --> 05:15.976
Oh, come on, Regina. You
don't need to be ashamed.

05:16.010 --> 05:20.980
Well, I know I don't
have to be, but... I am.

05:21.014 --> 05:22.915
Is everything okay?

05:22.950 --> 05:24.183
What are you doing here?

05:24.218 --> 05:27.086
Well, shouldn't someone
be out looking for Emma?

05:27.121 --> 05:29.589
Didn't Mary Margaret tell you?
She called.

05:29.624 --> 05:31.758
She figured out a way
to get rid of her magic.

05:31.792 --> 05:34.854
Get rid of it? And
you're okay with that?

05:34.855 --> 05:37.256
We support our daughter.

05:37.291 --> 05:40.859
We're not talking about an
old pair of Jimmy Choos here.

05:40.894 --> 05:43.662
Tell me you're joking.

05:43.697 --> 05:46.132
It may seem drastic,
but it's the only way

05:46.166 --> 05:48.667
Emma can be sure never
to hurt anyone again.

05:48.702 --> 05:50.796
This could be the worst
idea you've ever had,

05:51.156 --> 05:54.139
and you hired the wicked
witch as your nanny.

05:54.173 --> 05:55.974
Well, we actually think
it'll be good for her.

05:55.976 --> 05:58.210
We... she could be normal.

05:58.244 --> 06:02.047
Let me ask you something.

06:02.082 --> 06:04.650
Do you know what I regret most?

06:04.684 --> 06:06.234
Countless innocent
lives you destroyed?

06:08.922 --> 06:13.558
That I didn't support Henry
when he realized he was special.

06:13.593 --> 06:16.561
You of all people should remember.

06:16.596 --> 06:17.962
'Cause you started it all

06:17.997 --> 06:20.098
when you gave him that storybook.

06:20.133 --> 06:22.367
It opened up a whole world for him.

06:24.539 --> 06:28.039
But I was so scared of losing him...

06:30.909 --> 06:33.310
That I tried convincing
him he was crazy...

06:35.114 --> 06:37.949
and that being normal
would make things better.

06:40.052 --> 06:43.554
Thankfully, he had the
good sense not to listen to me.

06:43.588 --> 06:45.489
Regina's right.

06:46.958 --> 06:50.594
David, we've been
rationalizing, and you know it.

06:50.629 --> 06:52.863
We cannot let her take away
what's special about her.

06:52.897 --> 06:54.865
I know.

06:54.899 --> 06:56.800
Well, then let's go get her.

07:01.472 --> 07:03.040
Regina, your locator potion...

07:05.743 --> 07:07.044
it's gone.

07:07.078 --> 07:10.047
Where's Elsa?

07:19.456 --> 07:21.524
I'm sorry.

07:21.559 --> 07:23.125
Elsa won't save you.

07:23.160 --> 07:25.961
You don't know her. You don't know me.

07:25.996 --> 07:28.964
But I do. We're a lot alike.

07:28.999 --> 07:30.633
We had families,

07:30.668 --> 07:36.972
but we both grew up in this
palace, isolated and alone.

07:37.007 --> 07:42.812
I liked to go to the library
and bury myself in a good book.

07:42.846 --> 07:47.449
My favorite was an ancient norse
legend... The Trolden Glass.

07:47.483 --> 07:49.117
Perhaps you read it.

07:49.151 --> 07:51.386
Of course I did. I read
everything in there.

07:51.421 --> 07:53.822
Tell me what you remember.

07:53.856 --> 07:57.292
Giving a book report would be
a lot easier if you'd let me go.

07:57.327 --> 07:58.572
The other option is I kill you.

07:58.595 --> 08:00.729
It's about a norse king

08:00.763 --> 08:03.298
who had a beautiful
daughter he loved dearly.

08:03.333 --> 08:06.000
- Go on.
- He wanted his daughter

08:06.035 --> 08:08.236
to be able to see the
beauty he saw in her,

08:08.270 --> 08:10.404
so he had a mirror
made for her birthday.

08:10.439 --> 08:12.573
But the day before it, she died,

08:12.608 --> 08:15.243
so instead of reflecting her beauty,

08:15.277 --> 08:17.746
it reflected the ugliness
of his pain and sorrow.

08:17.780 --> 08:21.515
Very good. What happened then?

08:21.550 --> 08:24.985
- It's been awhile, okay?
- I don't remember every detail.

08:25.019 --> 08:26.621
Well, I do.

08:26.655 --> 08:30.791
He was so devastated,

08:30.825 --> 08:34.128
he decided his kingdom
should share his pain.

08:34.162 --> 08:37.631
So he spent years
harnessing dark magic,

08:37.666 --> 08:38.966
used it on the mirror,

08:39.000 --> 08:41.433
and cast a spell over
his entire kingdom.

08:41.469 --> 08:43.436
It made his subjects

08:43.471 --> 08:47.540
see only the worst in
the ones they loved.

08:47.575 --> 08:50.710
And they turned on each
other, destroying themselves.

08:50.745 --> 08:53.213
What does that story
have to do with anything?

08:53.248 --> 08:59.519
You were in my room. I'm
sure you saw the mirror.

08:59.553 --> 09:02.555
This is just a small piece of it.

09:02.590 --> 09:05.825
I spent years gazing into that mirror,

09:05.859 --> 09:10.163
but all I saw reflected
back at me was pain,

09:10.197 --> 09:11.664
just like the nordic king.

09:11.698 --> 09:15.668
You're going to cast that spell.

09:15.702 --> 09:19.338
The spell of shattered sight.

09:21.208 --> 09:25.178
It would take an entire lifetime
to cultivate enough power

09:25.212 --> 09:29.014
to cast a spell over
an entire kingdom.

09:29.048 --> 09:33.118
Luckily I only need
to cast it over you.

10:28.716 --> 10:30.209
You're sure these are from her bug?

10:30.210 --> 10:32.823
Oh, yeah, she definitely
spun out here, and then...

10:34.405 --> 10:36.205
She got out of the
car and got back in.

10:36.239 --> 10:38.040
Anyone else out here?

10:38.074 --> 10:42.178
No. It's just her footprints. Come on.

10:42.190 --> 10:43.540
These are so fresh, we
can carry on on foot.

10:43.546 --> 10:45.547
She can't have gone far.

10:53.290 --> 10:55.925
So, before we were interrupted,

10:55.959 --> 10:59.761
you were telling me about Robin Hood.

10:59.796 --> 11:03.465
Oh, there's not much to
tell. It's not gonna work out.

11:03.499 --> 11:05.534
It's the story of my life.

11:05.568 --> 11:08.370
Whatever's working
against my happiness

11:08.404 --> 11:10.472
is more powerful than I am.

11:10.506 --> 11:14.475
Why does it have to work against you?

11:14.509 --> 11:16.344
Look at me and David.

11:16.378 --> 11:18.023
We have faced impossible
odds numerous times...

11:18.047 --> 11:20.614
often because of you...

11:20.649 --> 11:22.783
And yet we've always worked out.

11:22.818 --> 11:25.453
You know why? Because we have hope.

11:26.588 --> 11:28.203
You get a quarter from
the hope commission

11:28.224 --> 11:29.390
every time you say that word.

11:29.424 --> 11:30.491
Admit it.

11:30.525 --> 11:31.859
I'm serious.

11:31.893 --> 11:35.529
Well, it's easy for you
to say... you're a hero.

11:35.564 --> 11:36.764
Whenever you need help,

11:36.798 --> 11:38.833
it just magically shows
up, like Henry's book.

11:38.867 --> 11:41.001
Yeah, I think that when you do good,

11:41.035 --> 11:42.850
the universe takes care of
you. That's why it showed up.

11:42.871 --> 11:46.506
Well, it doesn't really matter why.

11:46.540 --> 11:49.176
Your wishes are rewarded.
Mine are crushed.

11:49.210 --> 11:50.878
Well, I refuse to believe

11:50.912 --> 11:53.747
that happiness is impossible
for you to achieve.

11:53.781 --> 11:55.916
You've come too far.

11:55.950 --> 11:59.253
And, yes, you may be
sleeping with a married man,

11:59.287 --> 12:00.988
but guess what... so have I.

12:01.022 --> 12:04.491
Well, I've done far worse than that.

12:04.525 --> 12:07.660
Which doesn't mean that
you can't earn forgiveness,

12:07.695 --> 12:09.028
a chance at grace.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.697
I have to believe that.

12:10.731 --> 12:12.866
If you do good hoping to be redeemed,

12:12.900 --> 12:15.368
is that... really good?

12:17.805 --> 12:20.273
Maybe evil is born...

12:20.307 --> 12:23.509
And that's just who I am.

12:23.543 --> 12:27.346
Regina... you saw me grow up.

12:27.381 --> 12:31.250
You know how selfish and
shallow I could be as a child.

12:31.285 --> 12:33.419
You know what I've done since.

12:33.453 --> 12:36.254
You have literally seen my heart.

12:36.289 --> 12:39.425
You know it's not untouched.

12:39.459 --> 12:42.594
You are not all evil,
and I'm not all good.

12:42.629 --> 12:44.029
Things are not that simple.

12:44.063 --> 12:47.766
Well, whoever's guiding all
this seems to think it is.

12:47.801 --> 12:53.939
You're the hero, and I'm the villain.

12:53.973 --> 12:57.275
Free will be damned.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.777
It's all in the book.

12:59.812 --> 13:01.212
And we both know how it plays out.

13:01.247 --> 13:03.081
Mm, maybe, but maybe not.

13:03.115 --> 13:06.217
Your stories went poorly
because you made bad choices.

13:06.252 --> 13:09.219
But now you're making good ones.

13:09.254 --> 13:12.690
It may not happen as
quickly as you want, but...

13:12.724 --> 13:16.226
If you stay the course,
your happiness will come.

13:16.261 --> 13:18.329
You honestly believe that?

13:18.363 --> 13:21.031
It doesn't matter what I believe.

13:21.066 --> 13:23.468
What matters is that you do.

13:30.141 --> 13:33.243
She's really something, all right.

13:33.278 --> 13:36.613
If Evil Queens are your
type, which I get.

13:38.883 --> 13:41.018
You're still together, then.

13:41.052 --> 13:43.453
That is not relevant.

13:43.454 --> 13:45.355
Hey, no judgments here, mate.

13:45.389 --> 13:48.424
I was the one who told
you to follow your heart.

13:48.459 --> 13:51.230
I just want her to be happy,

13:51.231 --> 13:52.963
even if she thinks that's impossib...

13:52.997 --> 13:54.631
wait!

13:54.665 --> 13:56.032
Ah.

13:56.066 --> 13:58.001
Whoa!

13:58.035 --> 14:02.472
"1988 Mercedes-Benz
560SL repair manual."

14:02.506 --> 14:04.340
All due respect, I'm
beginning to think

14:04.375 --> 14:07.343
your magic-library
theory might be a tad off.

14:07.378 --> 14:10.613
Any book we want is hardly
gonna be stacked beside...

14:10.647 --> 14:14.183
"The cat in the hat."

14:14.218 --> 14:16.519
Why would a cat want a hat?

14:16.553 --> 14:18.053
I've seen stranger.

14:22.191 --> 14:24.660
Wait.

14:24.694 --> 14:26.361
This wasn't here before.

14:26.396 --> 14:27.663
What wasn't here?

14:27.697 --> 14:29.798
I'm not sure.

14:32.568 --> 14:35.737
Incredible.

14:35.771 --> 14:37.305
What is it?

14:37.340 --> 14:39.741
I need to reach Regina.

14:41.377 --> 14:44.479
Hello. Who is this?
Regina, it's Robin.

14:44.514 --> 14:48.349
I've just found something
that you have to see right now.

14:48.383 --> 14:50.518
Right now? I'm... I'm sorry,
but I'm in the middle...

14:50.553 --> 14:52.687
Go. We've got this.

14:52.721 --> 14:55.023
He found something.

14:55.057 --> 14:57.358
Maybe hope worked.

14:57.392 --> 15:00.695
Well, if it did, I owe you a quarter.

15:00.729 --> 15:04.532
I'll be right there.

15:18.080 --> 15:21.715
Hello? Gold? You here?

15:25.820 --> 15:27.988
Gold?

15:32.727 --> 15:35.729
Gold?

16:10.363 --> 16:13.898
Gold, you in there?!

16:18.671 --> 16:21.640
There's no need to shout.

16:21.674 --> 16:23.008
I'm right here.

16:23.042 --> 16:25.511
You'll forgive me if
I keep my distance.

16:25.545 --> 16:26.745
It would appear your powers

16:26.779 --> 16:28.446
are growing increasingly
out of control.

16:28.480 --> 16:30.782
Yeah, it was a rough night.

16:30.816 --> 16:33.084
So, what do I need to do?

16:33.119 --> 16:36.287
I've already cast the
spell inside that room.

16:36.321 --> 16:38.023
All you have to do is...

16:38.057 --> 16:40.825
Step through the door.

16:40.860 --> 16:43.661
Is something wrong?

16:43.695 --> 16:44.762
Just...

16:46.611 --> 16:48.098
I ran into the Snow Queen.

16:49.300 --> 16:50.201
Did you?

16:50.235 --> 16:51.536
Well, sort of.

16:51.570 --> 16:53.137
It was a projection or a hologram,

16:53.172 --> 16:54.572
or I don't know what it was.

16:57.977 --> 17:00.778
She said I shouldn't do this,
that you were trying to hurt me.

17:00.812 --> 17:03.113
All right, so now we know

17:03.148 --> 17:06.316
who doesn't want you to
do this... the villain.

17:06.349 --> 17:09.352
Sounds like an argument for
it, but maybe that's just me.

17:09.387 --> 17:11.722
That's what I said.

17:11.756 --> 17:12.955
But you still have doubts.

17:12.991 --> 17:14.223
Do you blame me?

17:14.258 --> 17:16.626
No.

17:16.661 --> 17:20.797
Is it safe? Will I be okay?

17:20.830 --> 17:23.700
No magic is without risk,

17:23.733 --> 17:26.636
even magic used to take away magic.

17:26.671 --> 17:30.240
Look, this is very much your choice.

17:30.274 --> 17:32.642
And, of course, it was also your idea.

17:32.677 --> 17:35.812
But it's gonna stop me
from hurting people.

17:35.846 --> 17:37.814
That much I can promise, yes.

17:48.759 --> 17:50.726
What would you do?

17:50.760 --> 17:53.696
I wouldn't go in there for anything.

17:53.730 --> 17:56.031
What? Why?

17:56.065 --> 17:58.267
Because, Emma, I'm not like you.

17:58.301 --> 18:04.406
I'm a man who makes wrong
decisions, selfish decisions.

18:04.441 --> 18:07.175
But you spent all that
time looking for Neal.

18:07.210 --> 18:09.711
You sacrificed yourself
to save the town.

18:09.746 --> 18:11.012
You married Belle.

18:11.047 --> 18:14.249
And each time, I meticulously
undid all the good.

18:14.283 --> 18:18.754
Neal is still gone, the
town is still in danger,

18:18.788 --> 18:22.823
and Belle, for better or
worse, she knows who I am,

18:22.858 --> 18:26.394
and that's the man who
always chooses power.

18:26.428 --> 18:28.596
She believes you can change.

18:28.631 --> 18:31.266
And I love her for that.

18:31.300 --> 18:33.934
But I fear she's quite likely wrong.

18:33.969 --> 18:38.139
But you, Emma?

18:38.173 --> 18:41.642
You don't need to change.

18:41.676 --> 18:44.812
Because you do the right thing.

18:44.846 --> 18:46.013
Always.

18:56.824 --> 18:58.692
Gold...

19:03.364 --> 19:05.432
Thank you.

19:06.618 --> 19:07.708
Of course.

19:09.304 --> 19:10.476
We have no choice.

19:36.610 --> 19:37.777
Swan!

19:37.811 --> 19:39.045
Watch your step, captain.

19:39.079 --> 19:40.947
The terrain's a little
rough around here.

19:40.981 --> 19:43.082
Get out of my way, Crocodile.

19:43.116 --> 19:44.516
I'll die fighting

19:44.551 --> 19:46.311
before I let you use
that bloody hat on Emma.

19:55.161 --> 19:57.696
Death can wait.

19:57.730 --> 19:59.331
How about before you depart,

19:59.365 --> 20:01.766
I'll treat you to a front-row seat

20:01.801 --> 20:04.936
and we can watch her
use that hat on herself?

20:04.971 --> 20:06.037
No.

20:06.072 --> 20:09.007
Oh, and, uh... In case
you were counting on

20:09.041 --> 20:10.675
Emma getting your message...

20:10.710 --> 20:11.843
Don't.

20:11.877 --> 20:13.845
No.

20:13.879 --> 20:15.480
I'm not one for loose ends.

20:15.514 --> 20:17.716
Don't worry.

20:17.750 --> 20:20.384
You'll get over her...

20:20.419 --> 20:22.487
Just like you got over Milah.

20:22.521 --> 20:25.490
How many centuries did that take?

20:25.524 --> 20:27.358
Oh, it matters not.

20:27.392 --> 20:30.228
This might even add
a little fuel to your fire.

20:30.262 --> 20:33.564
Don't tell me you haven't
missed the taste of vengeance.

20:33.599 --> 20:35.733
She's mother to your grandson, Gold!

20:35.767 --> 20:37.301
Don't do this.

20:37.336 --> 20:39.504
I wish I didn't have to.

20:39.538 --> 20:42.140
But I need miss Swan.

20:42.174 --> 20:45.342
Surely you understand that.

20:47.612 --> 20:50.014
Emma!

20:50.048 --> 20:51.715
Emma!

21:15.873 --> 21:18.507
Oh, thank goodness you're safe.

21:18.542 --> 21:20.109
At first, I couldn't find Ingrid.

21:20.144 --> 21:21.359
And ever since, I've
been worried sick.

21:21.378 --> 21:24.847
I suppose I should be grateful.

21:24.882 --> 21:27.116
Did everything go all right?

21:27.151 --> 21:29.285
You seem upset.

21:29.319 --> 21:31.954
What's all this?

21:31.989 --> 21:34.223
Oh, I wanted to surprise
you with something special.

21:34.257 --> 21:35.724
It's all chocolate.

21:35.758 --> 21:38.093
I'm afraid the ice
cream's long melted now,

21:38.127 --> 21:40.262
but I can make you more if you'd like.

21:40.297 --> 21:43.031
That's just like you...

21:43.066 --> 21:44.700
Thinking some food and fancy jewelry

21:44.734 --> 21:46.902
can make up for everything
you did to me.

21:46.936 --> 21:48.704
Everything I did to you?

21:48.738 --> 21:50.376
Anna, what are you talking about?

21:50.549 --> 21:51.764
It all came back to me

21:51.765 --> 21:53.641
when we were in the
east wing of the palace,

21:53.676 --> 21:56.644
how you ignored me
for all those years,

21:56.679 --> 21:58.747
left me to wander this
place like a ghost.

21:58.781 --> 22:01.981
Is this a joke? Because of my ruse?

22:01.985 --> 22:03.560
Because if you're
trying to get back at me,

22:03.565 --> 22:04.940
Anna, it isn't funny.

22:04.954 --> 22:07.255
Do you want to know the worst part?

22:07.289 --> 22:08.923
You let me believe
it was all my fault,

22:08.957 --> 22:12.227
that I had done something wrong.

22:12.261 --> 22:13.894
How can you say these things?

22:13.929 --> 22:16.897
We promised we'd never be like this.

22:16.932 --> 22:18.733
What's happened?

22:18.767 --> 22:21.336
I've come to my senses.

22:21.370 --> 22:23.971
Anna, no!

22:24.005 --> 22:25.245
Oh, this isn't you.

22:25.419 --> 22:27.341
- It can't be.
- I'm afraid it is.

22:28.749 --> 22:31.511
Ingrid, you're not...
in an urn. No.

22:31.546 --> 22:33.680
Fortunately, I have a
chance to show you

22:33.715 --> 22:36.516
that I am the only one who
will ever understand you.

22:36.551 --> 22:39.253
Anna never will.

22:39.287 --> 22:41.755
This is because of you.

22:41.789 --> 22:46.159
You used your magic to
cast a spell on her.

22:46.193 --> 22:51.131
Yes, but a spell that
reveals her true feelings,

22:51.165 --> 22:54.534
even if she wasn't able
to admit them before...

22:54.569 --> 22:59.639
Her deepest, darkest emotions
now brought into the light.

22:59.673 --> 23:02.475
You wouldn't even talk to me.

23:02.509 --> 23:05.779
"Go away, Anna. Go away, Anna."

23:05.813 --> 23:08.481
You were supposed to be my sister!

23:08.515 --> 23:09.816
I am your sister.

23:09.850 --> 23:13.152
Anna, please, put the down the urn.

23:13.186 --> 23:14.620
She won't listen to you, Elsa,

23:14.655 --> 23:16.855
just like your mother
wouldn't listen to me.

23:16.890 --> 23:20.259
The only way to stop her
is accept who you truly are.

23:20.294 --> 23:21.794
Use your powers on her.

23:21.828 --> 23:24.029
No. I won't give up on my sister.

23:24.063 --> 23:27.065
Do it, Elsa! Freeze her! No, I won't.

23:27.100 --> 23:29.334
I won't hurt my sister.

23:29.368 --> 23:31.670
Do it!

23:31.704 --> 23:32.905
Do what you will,

23:32.939 --> 23:36.275
but know that no matter
what, Anna, I love you.

23:43.249 --> 23:46.484
Wait. What?

23:46.519 --> 23:47.552
No!

23:47.586 --> 23:49.053
Elsa?!

23:49.087 --> 23:52.524
What did you make me do?

23:52.558 --> 23:54.025
You foolish girl.

23:54.059 --> 23:56.561
This is all your fault!

23:56.595 --> 23:58.730
Stay away from her!

23:58.764 --> 24:02.733
Oh. Here comes the noble hero.

24:02.767 --> 24:07.771
I know that look in your
eyes... in both of your eyes.

24:07.806 --> 24:08.906
Just let her go.

24:08.941 --> 24:13.344
Eventually, everyone
sees me as a monster.

24:14.579 --> 24:18.882
Maybe it's time to embrace that...

24:18.916 --> 24:21.251
And be one.

24:49.246 --> 24:53.382
Elsa...

24:53.416 --> 24:57.887
You will accept who
you are one day, too.

24:57.921 --> 25:01.056
And we will find our third sister,

25:01.091 --> 25:05.294
no matter how long it takes.

25:17.473 --> 25:20.308
Emma, stop!

25:20.342 --> 25:21.817
Elsa, what the hell
are you doing here?

25:21.844 --> 25:22.977
You have to leave now.

25:25.347 --> 25:28.249
I'm sorry. I won't let you do this.

25:28.284 --> 25:32.153
My powers are out of
control. There's no other way.

25:32.187 --> 25:34.022
- Please, go, now.
- No.

25:34.056 --> 25:35.623
You didn't give up on me

25:35.657 --> 25:38.459
even when you nearly froze
to death in that ice cave,

25:38.493 --> 25:40.128
so I'm not giving up on you now.

25:40.162 --> 25:44.799
I know how scary it is,
hurting someone you love.

25:44.833 --> 25:48.702
I've lived in fear of
that my entire life.

25:48.737 --> 25:52.005
But giving up your magic
is not the answer.

25:52.040 --> 25:53.741
There is another way.

25:53.775 --> 25:55.509
Yeah, you told me all about
how Anna's love saved you,

25:55.544 --> 25:59.479
and that's great, but guess what.

25:59.513 --> 26:04.318
My version of that with
Henry didn't work.

26:04.352 --> 26:06.353
This is all I have left.

26:15.163 --> 26:17.630
I was wrong.

26:17.665 --> 26:22.569
It wasn't just Anna's
love that saved me.

26:22.603 --> 26:24.236
What are you talking about?

26:24.271 --> 26:26.238
When I landed in this strange town,

26:26.273 --> 26:28.908
I was certain that
without Anna, I was doomed.

26:28.943 --> 26:32.178
But I got control over my
powers again without her.

26:32.212 --> 26:35.047
How?

26:35.082 --> 26:36.648
I didn't really know until today,

26:36.683 --> 26:38.384
until the same thing happened to you,

26:38.418 --> 26:39.751
and then it finally hit me.

26:39.786 --> 26:46.158
It's not only Anna's love
or Henry's that can save us.

26:46.193 --> 26:49.495
They accept us for who we
are, and that's important.

26:49.529 --> 26:55.501
But it's not enough. It's on us, too.

26:55.535 --> 27:00.706
You have to love yourself,
Emma, the good and the bad.

27:00.740 --> 27:04.376
The only way to ever truly
be in control of your powers

27:04.410 --> 27:05.743
is to embrace them.

27:05.777 --> 27:08.413
Because this...

27:08.447 --> 27:11.983
This is who you are.

27:18.424 --> 27:20.091
What are you doing?

27:21.394 --> 27:23.394
It's time to stop being afraid.

27:23.428 --> 27:25.396
But this could kill you.

27:25.430 --> 27:29.333
I'll take that risk if you will.

28:14.374 --> 28:17.409
No.

28:19.779 --> 28:21.699
Well, I'm guessing she
didn't go through with it.

28:22.973 --> 28:24.179
So sorry.

28:26.377 --> 28:29.012
Oh, but I do love the
look of loss on your face.

28:31.548 --> 28:33.649
I may not have the savior, pirate.

28:33.684 --> 28:40.090
But I assure you, today
won't be a complete loss.

28:40.124 --> 28:43.426
I need to fill that
hat with power, yes,

28:43.461 --> 28:46.396
but that was only
part of the equation.

28:48.599 --> 28:52.835
Because I need something
else, a secret ingredient,

28:52.870 --> 28:56.672
one I didn't know about...

28:56.707 --> 28:59.341
Until an associate clued me in.

28:59.376 --> 29:01.511
A heart.

29:01.545 --> 29:02.820
Well, if you need my
help procuring it,

29:02.846 --> 29:06.615
know the only help I give
you is with your demise.

29:06.649 --> 29:07.894
Oh, you're gonna help me, all right.

29:07.917 --> 29:08.884
Ah.

29:08.918 --> 29:10.852
You see, this spell

29:10.887 --> 29:13.989
is gonna finally separate
me from the dagger

29:14.024 --> 29:16.625
so it no longer holds power over me.

29:16.659 --> 29:18.693
But to cast it...

29:18.728 --> 29:21.530
I need the heart of someone special,

29:21.564 --> 29:25.033
someone who knew me
before the dagger...

29:25.067 --> 29:27.201
Before I was the Dark One.

29:27.236 --> 29:32.874
Unfortunately, everyone
who fits that description

29:32.909 --> 29:36.377
is already dead, but one still lives.

29:36.412 --> 29:38.479
No.

29:38.514 --> 29:40.814
No!
Yes.

29:40.849 --> 29:45.286
As luck would have it, dearie,
you're my oldest friend.

29:49.624 --> 29:52.326
Get on with it, then.

29:52.361 --> 29:54.494
Just do it.

29:54.529 --> 30:00.668
Oh, no. I promised you
we'd have some fun first.

30:00.702 --> 30:04.471
You're gonna do everything I say

30:04.505 --> 30:06.607
because you're my puppet now.

30:06.641 --> 30:08.676
You're gonna find another way

30:08.710 --> 30:11.178
to fill that hat with
the power it needs.

30:11.212 --> 30:16.283
And then? Then I'll kill you.

30:16.317 --> 30:22.622
I see someone's been practicing
their rock-troll memory magic.

30:22.656 --> 30:25.959
Quite impressive, dearie.

30:25.993 --> 30:29.361
You know, I-I prefer
her better this way.

30:29.396 --> 30:34.200
More cooperative. Less mouthy.

30:34.234 --> 30:35.868
Ooh.

30:35.903 --> 30:37.670
But this?

30:41.008 --> 30:43.476
This was much lovelier
when it was around her neck.

30:43.510 --> 30:47.146
You know... when she was breathing.

30:47.180 --> 30:49.381
What do you want, Rumplestiltskin?

30:49.416 --> 30:53.986
Just an old trinket your frozen
niece stole from me... a hat.

30:54.020 --> 30:55.588
I haven't seen it.

30:56.756 --> 31:01.292
Ooh, lying is so un-queenly, Ingrid.

31:05.097 --> 31:06.381
Where is she? Give her back...

31:06.382 --> 31:08.132
Careful, dearie.

31:08.166 --> 31:09.233
You're not the only one

31:09.267 --> 31:11.235
who knows how to hide
something of value.

31:11.269 --> 31:15.372
We wouldn't want it
lost forever, now would we?

31:15.406 --> 31:19.043
Though I'm curious why you took
memories from that poor girl.

31:19.077 --> 31:21.211
I mean, you would have thought

31:21.246 --> 31:24.148
being trapped inside a bread
bin was punishment enough.

31:24.182 --> 31:26.583
She learned more than
she was meant to.

31:26.618 --> 31:28.752
I wanted us to have a fresh start.

31:28.786 --> 31:32.022
Don't we all, dearie? Don't we all?

31:32.056 --> 31:36.893
You know, uh... I'm
gonna make you a deal...

31:36.927 --> 31:42.098
an urn for a hat, as simple as that.

31:42.133 --> 31:43.454
And just to make it easy for you,

31:43.467 --> 31:46.435
when you "find" the
object of my desire,

31:46.470 --> 31:49.539
just say my name three times,
and I shall come to you.

31:49.573 --> 31:52.108
See you soon!

31:58.748 --> 32:03.352
Swan! Are you all right?

32:03.387 --> 32:06.755
She didn't do it. She
didn't take away her magic.

32:06.790 --> 32:07.935
Wow, I've never seen people so happy

32:07.957 --> 32:09.692
about me not doing something.

32:09.726 --> 32:13.361
We'll find another way to defeat
the Snow Queen... together.

32:13.396 --> 32:14.763
Mm.

32:16.499 --> 32:18.533
Mm. Easy, tiger, we've got company.

32:18.568 --> 32:21.136
I didn't know you were
such a fan of my magic.

32:21.171 --> 32:23.338
Why would you say that, Swan?

32:23.372 --> 32:25.640
I'm a fan of every part of you.

32:25.675 --> 32:27.275
Are you all right?

32:27.310 --> 32:29.578
Of course, love. Why?

32:29.612 --> 32:30.912
If you look at me any harder,

32:30.946 --> 32:33.548
you're gonna drill a hole in my head.

32:33.583 --> 32:36.384
I'm just relieved.

32:36.419 --> 32:38.320
You should go outside.

32:38.354 --> 32:40.655
I have a feeling there
are a lot of worried people

32:40.690 --> 32:42.524
who will be glad to see you.

33:40.305 --> 33:42.006
I got here as fast as I could.

33:42.015 --> 33:43.905
What's so important you
couldn't say over the phone?

33:43.915 --> 33:44.911
I'll show you in a second.

33:44.915 --> 33:46.915
But first, you remember this?

33:47.012 --> 33:49.848
Uh, the book you
apparently stole from me?

33:49.882 --> 33:51.949
Yes, I remember it quite well.

33:51.984 --> 33:53.259
You knew I was a thief
when you met me.

33:53.285 --> 33:55.652
All right, so, tonight,
I came here looking,

33:55.687 --> 33:58.489
trying to find a clue
towards that author...

33:58.523 --> 33:59.723
towards your happy ending.

33:59.757 --> 34:01.025
In the public library?

34:01.059 --> 34:04.228
Robin, my happy ending is not
a Stephen King book-on-tape.

34:04.262 --> 34:06.797
Hang on. But then the
strangest thing happened.

34:06.831 --> 34:08.565
I found something.

34:20.710 --> 34:23.206
Is this... Us?

34:23.225 --> 34:24.592
Yes.

34:24.648 --> 34:26.693
Inside the pub.

34:26.850 --> 34:29.585
I don't understand.
This isn't what happened.

34:29.620 --> 34:31.754
Is this from the book?

34:31.788 --> 34:33.822
23... Page 23.

34:33.857 --> 34:35.257
Is it missing from the book?

34:35.292 --> 34:37.627
No. No, it's already there,
and it's you leaving me.

34:37.661 --> 34:40.630
This goes in the same place.

34:40.664 --> 34:43.733
This is the meeting that we never had.

34:46.069 --> 34:48.938
What does it mean?

34:48.972 --> 34:52.274
It means that your fate could
have gone many different ways.

34:52.308 --> 34:54.208
It means you're not doomed to suffer.

34:54.244 --> 34:58.213
There's a bright future
for you around every turn,

34:58.248 --> 35:00.149
even if you miss one.

35:02.185 --> 35:04.986
Well, where did you find it?

35:05.021 --> 35:07.656
Is there another book? What shelf?

35:07.690 --> 35:10.325
No, it was in my satchel.

35:10.360 --> 35:11.460
What?

35:11.494 --> 35:13.795
Not at first. It wasn't
there when I left.

35:13.829 --> 35:15.630
It... appeared.

35:15.665 --> 35:19.133
Like magic.

35:19.168 --> 35:20.401
It's a sign.

35:20.436 --> 35:23.572
And you can take it
however you want, but to me,

35:23.606 --> 35:27.676
it's showing you possibility... hope.

35:27.710 --> 35:32.213
That's not something that would
ever happen to a villain, is it?

35:35.817 --> 35:37.485
What is it?

35:39.854 --> 35:42.022
I owe someone a quarter.

37:06.973 --> 37:09.440
Rumplestiltskin.

37:09.475 --> 37:10.942
Rumplestiltskin.

37:10.977 --> 37:13.478
- Rumplest...
- Stop!

37:13.512 --> 37:17.314
I have traveled far to find you.

37:17.348 --> 37:18.982
Why are you conjuring the Dark One

37:19.016 --> 37:21.451
when you have a deal
with the sorcerer?

37:21.486 --> 37:25.489
Do you doubt he can
find the sister you seek?

37:25.523 --> 37:28.659
No. But I lost the one
that I already had.

37:28.693 --> 37:31.328
You told me you were a patient woman.

37:31.362 --> 37:36.166
Happy endings can take
a long time, but they do happen.

37:36.200 --> 37:39.703
Does that mean you found a match?

37:39.737 --> 37:42.138
The sorcerer did locate a
third magical sister, yes,

37:42.173 --> 37:46.275
and she... will be a perfect match.

37:46.310 --> 37:49.946
What do you mean, "will be"?

37:49.980 --> 37:52.948
Therein lies the catch.
She is not born yet.

37:52.982 --> 37:55.284
How does the sorcerer know something

37:55.319 --> 37:57.286
that hasn't happened yet?

37:57.321 --> 38:00.289
He knows many things.

38:00.324 --> 38:06.061
For example, he knows
that if you deliver that hat...

38:06.096 --> 38:11.499
To the Dark One, you will
never find your happy ending.

38:11.534 --> 38:15.337
But if I give it to you...

38:15.371 --> 38:17.072
I will?

38:17.107 --> 38:20.909
You will find this third sister

38:20.944 --> 38:25.113
and be reunited with
the one you've just lost.

38:33.789 --> 38:37.992
This door will lead
you to a new land...

38:38.026 --> 38:40.027
Where your happy ending awaits.

38:40.062 --> 38:45.867
Just hand over the box,
and I will open it for you.

38:45.901 --> 38:50.872
You said that the sorcerer
doesn't make deals...

38:50.906 --> 38:53.207
Especially with people like me.

38:53.242 --> 38:56.377
Why is he doing this now?

38:56.411 --> 39:00.046
The hat is important to him.

39:00.081 --> 39:03.417
And sometimes, people surprise you.

39:20.268 --> 39:22.568
Now take this.

39:22.603 --> 39:27.908
When the time comes...

39:27.942 --> 39:31.444
It will lead you to your third sister.

40:11.718 --> 40:15.498
Hey, yo! Hold up!

40:23.963 --> 40:27.098
Emma! Did you do it?

40:27.132 --> 40:28.933
- Oh.
- I didn't, thanks to Elsa.

40:29.989 --> 40:34.138
I'm so, so glad. Just...
Please don't change.

40:34.173 --> 40:35.206
I don't want to.

40:35.241 --> 40:36.316
We love you, no matter what.

40:36.341 --> 40:37.608
I know.

40:37.642 --> 40:39.977
Hey, kid. How are you?

40:40.011 --> 40:41.512
Just glad you're okay.

40:42.396 --> 40:46.103
So, your magic... are
you in control of it again?

40:46.486 --> 40:49.011
Absolutely.

41:31.509 --> 41:32.660
Cool.

41:35.685 --> 41:38.286
Mom, when did you get that?

41:38.321 --> 41:41.956
I don't know.

41:41.990 --> 41:44.658
Emma, what's happening?

41:46.428 --> 41:47.895
It won't come off.

41:47.930 --> 41:48.963
Mine won't, either.

41:54.203 --> 41:56.270
- Aah.
- I feel it, too.

41:56.305 --> 41:59.973
It's like it's funneling all
my magic away, like it's...

42:00.007 --> 42:01.642
Harnessing it somehow.

42:01.676 --> 42:03.644
Any idea what this is?

42:03.678 --> 42:05.283
No.

42:07.179 --> 42:09.224
But I have a pretty good
idea where it came from.

42:19.691 --> 42:21.659
You look disappointed.

42:21.693 --> 42:25.496
Miss Swan did not
behave as I had hoped.

42:25.531 --> 42:26.931
Did you have a hand in it?

42:26.965 --> 42:28.900
Of course not.

42:28.934 --> 42:31.435
My hands were trapped
here the entire time.

42:31.469 --> 42:34.604
Although, as you said,

42:34.639 --> 42:37.274
the urn dust didn't last long at all.

42:37.309 --> 42:38.943
I'd keep my distance if I were you.

42:38.977 --> 42:42.279
You really don't understand
what's happening, do you?

42:42.314 --> 42:44.681
I wasn't the one who saved Emma.

42:44.715 --> 42:46.116
Elsa was.

42:46.151 --> 42:50.787
They really are quite wonderful
together... like sisters.

42:50.822 --> 42:53.457
Your strange fixation really
holds no interest for me.

42:53.491 --> 42:55.058
Oh, but it should.

42:55.092 --> 42:56.225
And it will.

42:56.260 --> 43:00.530
You see, these ribbons
were of no use to me

43:00.565 --> 43:02.699
until this moment.

43:02.733 --> 43:04.867
They can bond
Three magical sisters together,

43:04.901 --> 43:09.072
but only if all of us
are a perfect match.

43:09.106 --> 43:11.640
And what makes for this perfect match?

43:11.675 --> 43:13.642
When all three have
embraced their powers,

43:13.677 --> 43:17.180
which we now have, thanks to you.

43:22.519 --> 43:25.654
Now I wield the magic
of my three sisters.

43:25.689 --> 43:28.323
Now my mirror is complete.

43:28.358 --> 43:30.158
And with this power,

43:30.193 --> 43:34.597
I can finally cast a spell
over all of Storybrooke.

43:34.631 --> 43:37.632
I could probably even defeat you

43:37.666 --> 43:41.236
and decorate this place
with your bones.

43:41.270 --> 43:42.471
Shall I try?

43:42.505 --> 43:47.842
Dearie, I warn you... do
not overestimate your power.

43:52.781 --> 43:57.785
And I warn you... don't
underestimate it.
