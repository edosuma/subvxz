01:50.210 --> 01:51.700
Oh, fuck!

02:37.590 --> 02:39.455
I wasn't trying to escape.

02:42.796 --> 02:45.788
No, please. Don't.

02:51.471 --> 02:54.907
Oh, God. I don't want to die.

02:59.579 --> 03:02.104
Yeah. Yeah, I'll make you clean.

03:07.887 --> 03:09.286
I'm sorry.

03:11.858 --> 03:14.122
I didn't mean to...

06:52.378 --> 06:53.709
Hey, sis.

06:54.747 --> 06:55.907
What time is it?

06:55.982 --> 06:57.643
Just after 8:00.

06:57.850 --> 06:59.010
You want me to make coffee?

06:59.085 --> 07:01.679
No, I gotta go. I'll call you later.

07:02.188 --> 07:04.179
You sure there's nothing I can do?

07:04.257 --> 07:07.818
Angie, everything's gonna be fine.
Just go back to sleep.

07:51.104 --> 07:53.402
<i>All right, I'm coming, I'm coming.</i>

07:57.443 --> 07:58.774
Ben Carson.

07:58.845 --> 08:03.043
Lorenzo Sapelli. I've been waiting for you.
Come on in.

08:03.116 --> 08:04.105
Thanks.

08:10.823 --> 08:12.290
How long you been working here?

08:12.358 --> 08:16.158
All together? Fifteen years.

08:17.597 --> 08:19.462
You were here for the fire?

08:20.600 --> 08:21.931
Devastating.

08:23.536 --> 08:26.403
Entire building up in flames.

08:36.315 --> 08:39.010
It has been five years since the fire.

08:39.085 --> 08:42.816
They're still in a legal battle
with the insurance companies.

08:42.889 --> 08:46.347
Even cleaning up this mess is impossible.

08:46.426 --> 08:49.589
I've given up faith about reopening,
and besides,

08:49.662 --> 08:53.564
who'd ever want to shop here
after everything that's happened?

08:54.467 --> 08:57.436
You know, the Meredith family
acquired this building

08:57.503 --> 09:01.098
after St. Matthew's Hospital
closed in 1952.

09:01.808 --> 09:05.505
It was the very first Mayflower
to open on the East Coast.

09:07.413 --> 09:11.873
Yeah, the company wants us to patrol
the premises every couple of hours,

09:11.951 --> 09:15.785
but I do my rounds every three.
That's more than enough.

09:15.855 --> 09:20.690
Anyway, you'll see, not too much
going on. It's pretty calm around here.

09:24.063 --> 09:26.657
Well, there you go.

09:27.400 --> 09:31.131
Perfume and cosmetics department,
what's left of it anyway.

09:35.208 --> 09:40.271
Thank God you didn't show up any later.
This place gives me the creeps at night.

09:40.346 --> 09:41.904
No electricity.

09:42.882 --> 09:44.577
All these mirrors.

09:45.451 --> 09:48.887
- Best to keep your eyes away from them.
- You polish them?

09:49.188 --> 09:52.089
- I'm sorry?
- The mirrors, they're so clean.

09:52.158 --> 09:55.218
No, that's Gary. Gary Lewis.

09:55.294 --> 09:57.728
Fellow who was working here before you.

09:57.797 --> 10:00.265
He was completely obsessed
with these damn mirrors.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.733
Spent the entire night cleaning them.

10:04.604 --> 10:07.539
How long has it been
since you left the NYPD?

10:10.042 --> 10:11.873
About a year.

10:11.944 --> 10:16.574
I know it's none of my business,
but why did you resign from the force?

10:17.517 --> 10:20.452
You used to be a detective,
is that correct?

10:20.987 --> 10:22.147
Yeah.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.483
I'm sorry.

10:24.557 --> 10:26.855
I always been too curious.

10:26.926 --> 10:28.450
It's all right.

10:36.769 --> 10:40.398
There was a pretty big team
working here before the fire.

10:40.473 --> 10:44.603
You know, when you stop to think,
of all the department stores in New York,

10:44.677 --> 10:48.113
this one was the most beautiful,
most luxurious.

10:49.048 --> 10:52.108
I mean, it breaks your heart, it really does.

10:52.919 --> 10:54.648
Well, here you go.

10:55.321 --> 10:58.017
This is where you'll be spending
most of your time.

10:58.090 --> 11:00.923
At least you got electricity in here.

11:00.993 --> 11:03.427
It's warm. It's nice.

11:03.496 --> 11:04.929
You've even got a TV.

11:18.711 --> 11:22.374
<i>I opened up the trunk,
which he so called hid the pictures.</i>

11:22.448 --> 11:25.315
<i>I grabbed the goody bag,
walked to the backyard,</i>

11:25.384 --> 11:29.445
<i>opened up the barbecue grill,
I grabbed the lighter fluid,</i>

11:29.522 --> 11:31.251
Waiting to Exhale.

11:32.425 --> 11:33.756
Hello?

11:34.961 --> 11:35.985
Hello.

11:36.062 --> 11:39.031
- Hey, Rosa, how are you doing?
- I'm fine. Let me help you.

11:39.098 --> 11:40.463
Thanks.

11:41.634 --> 11:42.760
Where are the kids?

11:42.835 --> 11:45.429
<i>Upstairs with Se√±or Ben.</i>

11:47.506 --> 11:48.734
Thanks.

11:48.808 --> 11:52.437
So everybody at my school
thinks this boy named Eamon,

11:52.511 --> 11:57.005
which is, like, one of my best friends,
which is a boy, likes me.

11:57.083 --> 12:01.577
And this girl named Christiana,
who liked him, is just now gossiping.

12:01.654 --> 12:03.019
You want me to talk to Mrs. Ward?

12:03.089 --> 12:07.788
She'll make them want to wrap me up
in toilet paper for Halloween.

12:07.860 --> 12:09.657
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.924
Look, Mommy. Look what Daddy got me.

12:11.998 --> 12:15.092
It looks great. You'll have to show me
how it works later, okay?

12:15.167 --> 12:17.431
It's so fast, Mommy.

12:17.503 --> 12:19.664
Ben? Can I talk to you?

12:20.539 --> 12:23.667
Yeah. Okay, you two.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.041
You need to finish your homework.
You need to get ready for your bath.

12:26.112 --> 12:27.602
Come on. No fooling around, let's go.

12:27.680 --> 12:29.705
Okay, let's go, Michael.

12:30.783 --> 12:33.377
Hey. Come here.

12:34.453 --> 12:36.148
Happy, happy birthday.

12:36.222 --> 12:38.019
- Thanks, Dad.
- Yeah.

12:39.458 --> 12:40.948
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:54.974 --> 12:56.771
- What is this?
- What?

12:56.842 --> 12:59.310
I've asked you
not to drop by without calling.

12:59.378 --> 13:00.743
You won't answer my calls.

13:00.813 --> 13:02.246
Please, Ben,
I don't want to argue with you.

13:02.314 --> 13:05.715
I don't want to argue, either. If you're not
gonna answer my calls, what...

13:08.954 --> 13:10.546
I haven't had a drink
for over three months,

13:10.623 --> 13:12.887
but since you won't answer your calls,
how would you know?

13:12.958 --> 13:14.550
I don't want to know.

13:14.827 --> 13:16.658
What I want is for you
to respect my needs.

13:16.729 --> 13:19.323
Amy, I'm doing everything I can
to respect your needs.

13:19.398 --> 13:21.457
I haven't had a drink.

13:21.534 --> 13:23.900
I got a new job to hold me over
till I'm reinstated.

13:23.969 --> 13:27.496
I'm doing everything I can
to get back on my feet again.

13:30.042 --> 13:31.339
What?

13:32.445 --> 13:34.276
You don't think people can change?

13:34.346 --> 13:37.873
We're not talking about people.
We're talking about you.

13:37.950 --> 13:39.941
Amy, I killed a man.

13:40.519 --> 13:42.714
You don't just get over that.

13:42.788 --> 13:44.756
I needed time. I needed you.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.724
- I was right here.
- Yeah.

13:46.792 --> 13:48.259
Judging me like everybody else.

13:48.327 --> 13:50.488
How dare you say that to me?

13:50.563 --> 13:53.031
I was the only one at the precinct
who defended you.

13:53.099 --> 13:56.364
How many times did I chase reporters
off our front lawn?

13:56.435 --> 13:58.960
How can you say that to me?

13:59.038 --> 14:00.232
I've always been in your corner!

14:00.306 --> 14:02.206
I've been the only one
who believed in you!

14:02.274 --> 14:04.105
You're fucking unbelievable!

14:04.176 --> 14:06.144
Please, I didn't come here to fight.

14:06.212 --> 14:09.511
Look, I'm sorry that I came over
without calling.

14:10.616 --> 14:12.846
I just wanted to see them.

14:12.918 --> 14:14.146
But we have to set up some rules.

14:14.220 --> 14:16.154
What fucking rules?

14:16.222 --> 14:18.782
Come on, Amy,
just tell me what rules I need to follow

14:18.858 --> 14:21.452
so I can see my son on his birthday!

14:22.194 --> 14:23.718
Look at yourself.

14:25.164 --> 14:27.928
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.096
I don't know how you're going to be
from one moment to the next.

14:32.171 --> 14:36.733
When I get around you, I get nervous.

14:36.809 --> 14:39.835
Because I am so scared
that I am losing you.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.672
And I screw everything up.

14:44.683 --> 14:47.846
- I've missed you so much.
- I miss you, too.

14:49.255 --> 14:51.621
Amy, we deserve another chance.

14:51.690 --> 14:56.423
I know how much I love you, and I know
somewhere inside there, you love me, too.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.091
Please.

15:02.768 --> 15:04.133
Please.

15:16.448 --> 15:18.109
I can't do this.

15:18.684 --> 15:20.481
I can't do this, Ben.

15:24.456 --> 15:25.616
Fuck.

19:32.104 --> 19:33.401
Holy shit.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.852
What the hell?

20:49.181 --> 20:50.307
Fuck!

20:51.450 --> 20:52.747
Man.

21:01.293 --> 21:02.487
What the...

21:48.273 --> 21:50.639
- You should stop taking those pills.
- Jesus!

21:53.478 --> 21:55.537
How are you doing today?

21:56.548 --> 22:00.712
I'm fine. I feel a lot better.
I'm leaving in a couple of minutes.

22:02.387 --> 22:03.945
Are you sure you're all right?

22:04.022 --> 22:05.216
Please, not you.

22:05.290 --> 22:08.418
Okay. I'm just saying,
you can talk to me if you want.

22:08.493 --> 22:10.358
I'm your little sister.

22:12.264 --> 22:13.754
It's that new job, isn't it?

22:13.832 --> 22:16.460
Yeah, well, I need that new job.

22:16.535 --> 22:20.631
I can't take care of Amy and the kids
and myself on my pension.

22:20.706 --> 22:24.005
I'm not gonna sleep on your couch
for the rest of my life.

22:24.076 --> 22:28.740
Okay, well, maybe you get a daytime job,
a regular job.

22:28.814 --> 22:30.577
It's not that simple.

22:32.150 --> 22:34.482
Well, you should think about it.

22:47.099 --> 22:49.033
Ben! What happened?

22:49.768 --> 22:52.498
Just leave me alone.
Please, just leave me alone!

22:52.571 --> 22:54.664
Angie, get out of here! Now!

23:21.566 --> 23:23.659
What is happening to you, Ben?

23:24.269 --> 23:26.567
Pull yourself together.

26:19.811 --> 26:20.971
Help!

26:24.149 --> 26:27.380
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my...

26:27.452 --> 26:28.817
No!

27:33.818 --> 27:35.217
"Gary Lewis."

28:47.492 --> 28:48.720
Esseker.

28:50.128 --> 28:51.618
Esseker.

30:16.915 --> 30:18.246
Hello?

30:20.518 --> 30:21.849
Hello?

30:24.055 --> 30:26.023
Where are you?

30:26.091 --> 30:29.424
I want to help you,
but I need to know where you are!

30:29.494 --> 30:30.859
Damn it!

30:36.167 --> 30:37.532
I'm coming!

31:04.062 --> 31:05.393
Anybody here?

31:08.032 --> 31:09.624
Is anybody in here?

32:01.286 --> 32:03.186
Fuck this place.

33:25.203 --> 33:26.670
Mom! Mom! Mom!

33:26.738 --> 33:29.298
- Mom! Mom!
- Michael?

33:29.374 --> 33:32.036
Are you okay? What's happening?

33:32.110 --> 33:34.635
Michael. What's the matter, sweetie?

33:35.346 --> 33:37.507
- There's a lady screaming.
- Where?

33:37.582 --> 33:41.074
- There, in the mirror.
- In the mirror?

33:41.452 --> 33:43.682
I don't see anybody
but you and I in the mirror.

33:43.755 --> 33:46.053
- You just had a nightmare, sweetie.
- Okay.

33:46.124 --> 33:48.422
Sometimes they can feel really real,
but they're not, all right?

33:48.493 --> 33:50.586
- Okay.
- Okay, let's go back to sleep.

33:50.662 --> 33:53.290
Come on. In you go.

33:53.364 --> 33:56.162
I'm right around the corner, all right?

33:56.234 --> 33:59.032
- Love you.
- I love you, too, sweetie.

34:01.639 --> 34:04.608
- Can you leave the door open?
- Sure, sweetheart.

34:04.676 --> 34:07.907
- But you go back to sleep, okay?
- All right, Mom.

34:07.979 --> 34:09.742
<i>... not clear how it happened.</i>

34:09.813 --> 34:13.272
<i>The 42-year-old is expected to go
on trial this month for allegedly</i>

34:13.351 --> 34:16.252
<i>sexually assaulting a former co-worker
in her apartment</i>

34:16.321 --> 34:19.757
<i>for 13 hours on Halloween night in 2005.</i>

34:19.824 --> 34:23.851
<i>Braunstein's lawyer says his client
was mentally ill at the time.</i>

34:24.094 --> 34:27.724
<i>The Feds say they'll seek the death
penalty against a former mob boss</i>

34:27.799 --> 34:30.029
<i>accused of ordering a hit on a rival.</i>

34:30.101 --> 34:32.092
<i>The trial of Vincent "Vinny Gorgeous"...</i>

34:54.492 --> 34:57.052
I swear to you,
I could feel my flesh burning.

34:57.128 --> 35:00.325
I couldn't breathe.
It was like my lungs were full of smoke.

35:00.398 --> 35:04.164
It was like a nightmare, but I was awake.
I know I was awake.

35:05.937 --> 35:08.872
- You think I'm crazy, don't you?
- I don't know what to think.

35:08.940 --> 35:10.965
I think you're just going through
a hard time in your life.

35:11.042 --> 35:13.203
You're under a lot of stress.

35:13.277 --> 35:16.769
You've been having those nightmares
since the shooting.

35:20.284 --> 35:23.617
- You know it wasn't your fault.
- They're everywhere.

35:24.489 --> 35:27.947
- What are you talking about?
- The fucking mirrors, they are everywhere,

35:28.026 --> 35:29.823
in the department store,
on the corner of every street,

35:29.894 --> 35:32.795
in the window of every building
in this city.

35:32.864 --> 35:34.354
I feel...

35:35.933 --> 35:40.267
I feel like I'm not the one
looking into the mirrors

35:40.338 --> 35:42.670
but they're looking back at me.

35:44.308 --> 35:47.835
There's no one looking back at you
through the mirrors.

35:48.913 --> 35:53.043
You're obviously... You're still conflicted
about what happened.

35:55.653 --> 35:58.247
Maybe you need to talk to someone.

35:58.456 --> 36:00.515
A professional, someone...

36:03.561 --> 36:06.689
Mirrors are just glass and silver, Ben.
That's it.

36:06.764 --> 36:08.755
There's nothing behind them.

36:11.135 --> 36:13.968
Will you please go get some sleep, okay?

36:15.039 --> 36:16.506
I love you.

36:31.189 --> 36:32.520
Coming!

36:35.893 --> 36:37.224
Hold on!

36:45.169 --> 36:47.364
- Mr. Carson?
- Yeah.

36:47.438 --> 36:49.770
You want to sign here, please?

36:54.979 --> 36:57.345
- You have a good day, sir.
- Thanks.

37:08.826 --> 37:10.123
Holy shit.

38:18.896 --> 38:20.887
Lorenzo, I need to talk to you.

38:20.965 --> 38:24.867
I just had the craziest day here.
Your ex-colleagues came to pay us a visit.

38:24.936 --> 38:25.994
What are you talking about?

38:26.070 --> 38:28.538
Well, you know Gary, the guy
who was working here before you?

38:28.606 --> 38:29.664
Yeah.

38:29.740 --> 38:32.903
Cops found him dead
in a subway station in Harlem.

38:32.977 --> 38:36.538
I never liked him too much, but,
poor guy, he didn't deserve to go like that.

38:36.614 --> 38:38.275
Did they happen to tell you
the cause of death?

38:38.349 --> 38:40.214
- What?
- Did they tell you how he died?

38:40.284 --> 38:42.115
No, no, they wouldn't tell me.

38:42.186 --> 38:45.087
Mrs. Sapelli is waiting for me at home.
I got to go.

38:45.156 --> 38:47.386
By the way,
about that leak in the basement.

38:47.458 --> 38:51.758
They're sending someone over
to work on that, beginning of next week.

39:20.458 --> 39:24.622
We have a white male, 50 years of age,
name unknown.

39:25.463 --> 39:27.931
Following the completion
of the external examination,

39:27.999 --> 39:30.559
the body was washed and lightly dried.

39:30.635 --> 39:34.401
A Y-incision was made
from the bilateral clavicular joints

39:34.472 --> 39:36.599
to the xiphoid process.

39:36.674 --> 39:39.199
- The tissue was waterlogged...
- Amy.

39:39.277 --> 39:40.539
Yes, what is it?

39:40.611 --> 39:44.103
There's someone in the lobby for you.
It sounds urgent.

39:52.657 --> 39:53.919
Ben.

39:53.991 --> 39:55.322
What's happening?
What are you doing here?

39:55.393 --> 39:58.226
Thanks for seeing me.
Look, I need to ask you a favor.

39:58.296 --> 40:00.924
- I'm in the middle of work.
- I know. Twenty minutes.

40:00.998 --> 40:03.193
Yesterday morning you picked up a body.

40:03.267 --> 40:06.327
Gary Lewis.
I just need to take a look at him.

40:06.804 --> 40:08.101
- Who is he?
- He was a night watchman

40:08.172 --> 40:10.470
at the Mayflower. I replaced him.

40:10.541 --> 40:12.008
How do you have his driver's license?

40:12.076 --> 40:16.069
I found his wallet in the department store.
Look, I just need to know how he died.

40:16.881 --> 40:18.849
Why do you need to know how he died?

40:18.916 --> 40:21.680
Ben, you've been suspended. You're not
supposed to be doing any investigations.

40:21.752 --> 40:23.811
Amy, please, just listen to me.
This is serious.

40:23.888 --> 40:26.789
There are some very strange things
happening over at the Mayflower.

40:26.857 --> 40:28.984
I can't explain, but it's...

40:30.127 --> 40:33.096
This guy Gary Lewis sent me a package
right before he died.

40:33.164 --> 40:35.132
Thing is, I never met him before.

40:35.199 --> 40:38.362
Inside the package were all these articles
on the Mayflower, on the fire.

40:38.436 --> 40:42.065
It was like he was trying to tell me
something or warn me about something.

40:42.139 --> 40:44.334
I need to figure this out. Please.

40:44.408 --> 40:48.071
Gary Lewis, Gary Lewis. There he is, B-16.

40:48.679 --> 40:49.941
He slashed his throat.

40:50.014 --> 40:53.347
There you go, there's your answer.
Your man committed suicide.

40:53.417 --> 40:58.047
And you get a lot of suicide cases
with people that slash their own throats?

40:58.956 --> 41:01.948
I didn't think so. Excuse me.

41:02.026 --> 41:05.325
All I know is,
the police are still investigating this one.

41:05.396 --> 41:06.693
That's why we still have the body.

41:06.764 --> 41:09.289
What did he use to cut his throat?

41:09.367 --> 41:11.198
A piece of mirror.

41:12.536 --> 41:14.367
He probably broke the mirror into pieces

41:14.438 --> 41:17.100
so he'd have something
to cut himself with.

41:17.174 --> 41:19.005
Seven years bad luck.

41:20.945 --> 41:22.537
Esseker.

41:22.613 --> 41:24.444
Are you okay, Ben?

41:25.149 --> 41:26.480
I'm fine.

41:29.487 --> 41:31.421
I'm sorry, excuse me.

41:34.625 --> 41:36.559
I need to see his file.

41:36.627 --> 41:38.492
- What?
- I need his file.

41:38.562 --> 41:39.586
- Ben.
- What's the problem?

41:39.663 --> 41:40.721
I just need to see his file.

41:40.798 --> 41:42.629
Calm down. You're not even
supposed to be down here,

41:42.700 --> 41:44.964
and now you want to
look at somebody's file?

41:45.035 --> 41:46.866
Look, I'll be off then.

41:46.937 --> 41:49.167
Amy, you know where to find me
if you need me.

41:49.240 --> 41:51.868
Yeah. Thanks, Peter. I appreciate it.

41:57.114 --> 42:00.948
- I want you to leave now. I'm serious, Ben.
- Amy, I'm sorry.

42:01.352 --> 42:04.116
I can't leave here until I see that file.

42:04.622 --> 42:06.681
It's important, please.

42:08.058 --> 42:09.355
Please.

42:37.521 --> 42:40.684
Amy, come here and look at this picture.

42:44.361 --> 42:46.886
Look at the piece of mirror
that Gary Lewis is holding.

42:46.964 --> 42:51.025
And look at it up here
in its reflected image in the other mirror.

42:52.136 --> 42:53.933
It's full of blood.

42:54.004 --> 42:57.963
Yet in reality, it's perfectly clean.
Not a single drop, not a single drop on it.

42:58.042 --> 43:00.476
So what? It's probably the angle
from which the photograph was taken.

43:00.544 --> 43:02.569
What are you trying to prove?

43:02.646 --> 43:05.479
What if the mirrors are showing us
something that's not really happening?

43:05.549 --> 43:08.211
- What are you talking about?
- No, just listen to me.

43:08.285 --> 43:13.086
What if the mirrors are reflecting
something that's beyond our reality?

43:13.157 --> 43:15.751
What if the mirrors can actually make us
do things that we don't want to do?

43:15.826 --> 43:17.521
Like making Gary Lewis
slit his own throat.

43:17.595 --> 43:21.429
Ben, listen to yourself.
You can't talk like that around here.

43:21.499 --> 43:23.660
Don't you want to get reinstated?

43:23.734 --> 43:27.568
Amy, I'm seeing things in the mirrors
at work, bad things,

43:27.638 --> 43:29.868
to the point where I can feel
what they're showing me.

43:29.940 --> 43:33.740
Ben, you're driving me fucking crazy!
I don't have time for this.

43:33.811 --> 43:34.937
What's wrong with you?

43:35.012 --> 43:38.914
Do you think I'm making this up?
Do you think I'm fucking lying?

43:41.385 --> 43:44.718
What medication are you taking
to stop drinking?

44:01.338 --> 44:03.203
That's a strong drug.

44:03.774 --> 44:08.302
It has a lot of serious side effects.
How many pills are you taking a day?

44:11.815 --> 44:14.181
I'm sorry that I bothered you.

44:14.952 --> 44:16.385
You're right.

44:17.655 --> 44:19.680
Thanks for trying to help.

46:27.885 --> 46:29.978
...night at this bar.
It's a couple of blocks from here.

46:30.054 --> 46:32.215
- All right. Where's the body?
- Calm down.

46:32.289 --> 46:34.951
- I can't. How am I gonna calm down?
- Let the detective by. Step over here.

46:35.025 --> 46:37.926
And there's a guy been living with her
at her place. There's a guy.

46:37.995 --> 46:41.556
All right. You say she works at this bar?
At night?

46:41.632 --> 46:43.623
Yeah, she works nights. She goes nights.

46:43.701 --> 46:46.033
She comes home late.
I don't see her come home.

46:46.103 --> 46:47.627
She probably closes the bar, right?

46:47.705 --> 46:51.266
Yeah. 'Cause she sleeps during the day,
like early morning hours.

46:51.341 --> 46:52.706
All right.

47:18.435 --> 47:23.031
I saw blood falling from the ceiling.
Then she call me.

47:23.107 --> 47:26.474
I want you to ask her,
did she hear any noises, any sounds?

47:26.543 --> 47:27.737
- What's going on?
- One second.

47:27.811 --> 47:30.507
It's all right, I live in apartment eight.
I used to be a cop.

47:30.581 --> 47:33.141
- Just tell me what's going on.
- Just a second.

47:33.217 --> 47:36.277
I want to talk to the lead detective!
Angela!

47:36.353 --> 47:39.379
- Who is the lead detective?
- Ben.

47:39.790 --> 47:42.554
Larry, what the hell are you doing here?

47:43.293 --> 47:46.854
- Larry, just tell me what's going on.
- Ben, it's not good.

47:46.930 --> 47:48.557
Where's Angie?

47:50.334 --> 47:53.428
Where the fuck is my sister?
Tell them to let go of me!

47:53.504 --> 47:55.904
- I can't do that, Ben!
- God damn it!

48:39.516 --> 48:42.349
<i>The water has obliterated
most of the marks.</i>

48:42.619 --> 48:45.452
No sign of struggle or forced entry.

48:45.956 --> 48:49.357
And the front door was locked,
which means that

48:49.426 --> 48:51.519
the person who did this
either had keys to the apartment

48:51.595 --> 48:53.825
or it was someone that she knew.

48:53.897 --> 48:56.593
He would've never laid a finger on her.

48:57.367 --> 49:01.064
You know, when their father died,
Ben took care of Angela.

49:03.507 --> 49:04.565
She meant the world to him.

49:04.641 --> 49:08.600
Listen, so far, his statement is pretty
consistent with the facts, you know?

49:08.679 --> 49:11.671
We checked it out.
He showed up to work at 7:00 p.m.

49:11.748 --> 49:12.976
And the downstairs neighbors said

49:13.050 --> 49:16.247
they began to notice the water leakage
at around 10:00.

49:16.320 --> 49:19.380
The only strange thing,
and this could just be a coincidence,

49:19.456 --> 49:23.392
is that Ben told the daytime
security guard, Lorenzo Sapelli,

49:23.460 --> 49:26.224
that he was planning on quitting the job.

49:26.296 --> 49:30.960
Like he was moving away someplace.
He mention anything like that to you?

49:31.034 --> 49:32.194
No.

49:33.537 --> 49:36.870
Lately, communication hasn't been
our strong point.

49:37.474 --> 49:38.702
What are you gonna do with him?

49:38.775 --> 49:40.766
I figure we'll let him go.
We got no reason to keep him here.

49:40.844 --> 49:42.175
Larry.

49:55.025 --> 49:56.686
I'm so sorry.

49:58.262 --> 49:59.786
Ben?

49:59.863 --> 50:02.798
Why don't you come home
and spend some days with the kids?

50:02.866 --> 50:04.390
I can't.

50:05.202 --> 50:08.171
I don't want to put our children in danger.

50:09.206 --> 50:11.766
She asked me to quit, but I wouldn't.

50:13.076 --> 50:16.944
- They came after her.
- What are you talking about?

50:19.816 --> 50:22.512
I've got some things I need to take care of.

50:22.586 --> 50:25.714
- Wait, Ben. Please.
- Amy. Amy, let me go.

50:25.789 --> 50:27.279
I don't want you
to get in any more trouble.

50:27.357 --> 50:30.884
- Please stay out of it.
- I know who did this.

50:30.961 --> 50:34.522
Well, in that case,
you've got to tell Larry everything.

50:37.100 --> 50:39.091
He'll never believe me.

50:40.804 --> 50:42.465
Neither will you.

52:04.621 --> 52:06.646
What do you want?

52:06.723 --> 52:08.588
Please, just tell me.

52:09.292 --> 52:11.522
What do you want from me?

52:16.433 --> 52:18.901
What do you want from me?

52:39.423 --> 52:41.448
"Esseker."

52:46.263 --> 52:49.960
Hey. I need you to run a name for me.
Esseker.

52:50.033 --> 52:54.902
Echo, Sierra, Sierra, Echo,
Kilo, Echo, Romeo.

52:54.971 --> 52:58.463
<i>- Did you check online?
- I've already done that.</i>

52:58.542 --> 53:01.102
Nothing. IRS and DMV.

53:01.178 --> 53:03.043
<i>- Where?
- Try New York.</i>

53:03.113 --> 53:04.740
<i>- When?
- Last five or six years.</i>

53:04.815 --> 53:06.146
<i>Okay, Ben.</i>

53:06.216 --> 53:08.741
Thanks.
Get back to me as soon as you can.

53:10.554 --> 53:13.421
"Mayflower burns, 48 presumed dead."

53:15.625 --> 53:18.423
"Berry confesses to
deadly Mayflower fire."

53:23.767 --> 53:25.701
"Watchman arrested."

53:27.838 --> 53:31.638
"Woman, three children murdered."
Come on, Ben, connect the dots.

53:31.708 --> 53:33.972
"Mr. Berry maintains that
the mirrors in the store are the ones

53:34.044 --> 53:37.207
"that brutally killed his wife
and three children."

53:41.551 --> 53:44.281
"Mirrors are guilty. Mirrors are guilty."

53:44.988 --> 53:47.479
<i>- Yeah. What did you get?
- Hey.</i>

53:47.557 --> 53:50.390
<i>Look, I didn't find anything
under that name.</i>

53:50.460 --> 53:53.054
Shit! Shit.

53:53.130 --> 53:55.690
<i>Do you want me
to look outside New York?</i>

53:55.765 --> 53:58.359
No. Hold on. Hold on.

54:02.272 --> 54:05.833
I want you to run another name for me.
Berry, Terrence Berry.

54:05.909 --> 54:08.377
<i>Terrence Berry.</i>

54:09.312 --> 54:10.540
<i>Wait one sec.</i>

54:13.817 --> 54:17.275
<i>- I think I got him. You still there?
- Yeah.</i>

54:18.088 --> 54:21.546
<i>- Your guy murdered his whole family.
- I already know that.</i>

54:21.625 --> 54:23.024
<i>He's dead.</i>

54:24.561 --> 54:25.892
Damn it.

54:27.631 --> 54:30.464
Can you tell me where he was committed
before he died?

54:33.403 --> 54:36.702
You know, Mr. Carson, when one
starts to perceive one's own reflection

54:36.773 --> 54:38.638
as a completely separate being,

54:38.708 --> 54:41.905
one is suddenly confronted
with two entirely separate egos,

54:41.978 --> 54:45.675
two entirely separate worlds
that can surface at any given moment.

54:45.749 --> 54:49.048
A feeling of self-hatred,
usually triggered by a psychological shock

54:49.119 --> 54:50.950
can split the personality in two.

54:51.021 --> 54:54.320
Hence creating two or more personalities
with distinct memories

54:54.391 --> 54:57.986
and distinct behavior patterns
within the same individual.

54:58.061 --> 55:02.464
The patient then has
the false perception of the existence

55:02.532 --> 55:06.798
of two distinct worlds, the real world
and the world inside a mirror.

55:11.641 --> 55:14.303
These recordings were used
in Terrence's trial.

55:17.614 --> 55:19.479
You'll see they speak for themselves.

55:23.787 --> 55:25.721
<i>Why did you set
the department store on fire?</i>

55:25.789 --> 55:28.952
<i>In order to destroy the mirrors.</i>

55:30.894 --> 55:34.455
<i>Only fire can destroy mirrors,
isn't that right, Doctor?</i>

55:35.565 --> 55:40.059
<i>What made you think you absolutely
had to destroy those mirrors, Terrence?</i>

55:43.707 --> 55:48.644
<i>They killed my Helen
and my three children.</i>

55:49.412 --> 55:50.811
<i>For what reason?</i>

55:50.880 --> 55:52.279
<i>Why would mirrors
want to kill your family?</i>

55:52.349 --> 55:55.045
<i>- Because I didn't...
- Didn't do what?</i>

55:57.487 --> 55:59.216
<i>They asked me to find Esseker.</i>

55:59.289 --> 56:00.313
Oh, my God.

56:00.390 --> 56:02.187
<i>We all are looking for Esseker.</i>

56:02.259 --> 56:03.954
Amy.

56:04.027 --> 56:06.086
Excuse me, I have to go.

56:07.430 --> 56:12.060
<i>Tell me about Esseker, Terrence.
Who is Esseker?</i>

56:12.135 --> 56:14.797
<i>I don't know who Esseker is!</i>

56:15.839 --> 56:18.501
<i>I don't know who Esseker is!</i>

56:20.143 --> 56:21.440
<i>I don't know.</i>

56:29.753 --> 56:31.880
Mrs. Carson? It's Rosa.

56:32.555 --> 56:37.424
Mr. Ben is here.
He's moving all of the furniture around.

57:10.694 --> 57:13.458
- Hey. How was school today?
- Good.

57:13.530 --> 57:15.794
Good. I'll be right back.

57:27.410 --> 57:28.434
Dad...

57:28.511 --> 57:32.140
Sweetheart, just give me a second.
I gotta take care of a couple of things.

57:54.671 --> 57:56.764
Daddy, what are you doing?

57:59.642 --> 58:01.940
Honey, don't look scared.
Everything's fine.

58:02.011 --> 58:04.912
I think it looks nicer like this. Don't you?

58:21.364 --> 58:23.457
Rosa, what's happening?

58:23.767 --> 58:26.964
Take the kids downstairs, right now.
Right now.

58:27.504 --> 58:28.596
What the hell are you doing?

58:28.671 --> 58:30.866
Amy, you're gonna have to trust me.
This is for your own protection.

58:30.940 --> 58:33.306
Get out of the house, right now!

58:33.410 --> 58:36.470
Hey, are you listening to me?
You are scaring the kids!

58:36.546 --> 58:38.036
If you don't leave immediately,
I'm calling the police,

58:38.114 --> 58:40.082
and I warn you,
you will never see your kids again!

58:40.150 --> 58:42.516
Amy, I am not crazy.
These mirrors are dangerous.

58:42.585 --> 58:45.577
At first I thought it was just the ones
in the store, but after Angela was killed,

58:45.655 --> 58:46.952
I realized they can get at you anywhere.

58:47.023 --> 58:50.959
I promise I will leave the house.
Just let me cover these damn mirrors.

58:51.027 --> 58:52.961
What's wrong with you?

58:54.164 --> 58:56.257
I know what you've been going through
hasn't been easy.

58:56.332 --> 58:59.927
But guess what?
It hasn't been easy for us, either!

59:00.003 --> 59:02.995
Angela was a part of our lives, too,
you know that?

59:03.072 --> 59:05.905
It's not fair what you're doing to us, Ben!

59:05.975 --> 59:09.741
Michael... He's acting so strange now.

59:09.813 --> 59:13.840
He always wants to be alone. He won't
talk to me. He's having nightmares.

59:13.917 --> 59:16.784
Ben, your behavior is rubbing off on him!

59:16.853 --> 59:19.788
He is six years old. I have to protect him!

59:20.023 --> 59:22.253
I want to show you something.

59:25.061 --> 59:26.653
- Ben, let go of me!
- You don't want to believe me?

59:26.729 --> 59:27.753
Fine, I'll show you.

59:27.831 --> 59:30.322
- What are you doing?
- I'll show you!

59:31.935 --> 59:33.425
Are you crazy?

59:35.738 --> 59:37.899
- Have you gone completely mad?
- Just wait, you'll see.

59:37.974 --> 59:39.839
- See what?
- You'll see.

59:40.477 --> 59:43.469
See what, Ben?
What am I supposed to see?

59:51.488 --> 59:53.251
It's not happening.

59:54.290 --> 59:56.087
It's not happening.

59:56.292 --> 59:59.090
Amy, I swear to you, at the Mayflower...

01:00:02.165 --> 01:00:04.030
I am not lying.

01:00:19.849 --> 01:00:22.943
Ben. Let's go back inside, okay?

01:00:26.489 --> 01:00:28.320
Put the gun away.

01:00:30.426 --> 01:00:33.862
Listen to me, baby. I want to help you.

01:00:34.330 --> 01:00:35.957
Tell the kids I'm sorry.

01:00:36.032 --> 01:00:37.260
Ben!

01:01:09.365 --> 01:01:10.423
No!

01:04:58.227 --> 01:04:59.785
Jesus Christ.

01:05:52.949 --> 01:05:54.974
Larry, it's me. I need your help again.

01:05:55.051 --> 01:05:58.612
I'm trying to locate the patient-employee
manifest for St. Matthew's Hospital.

01:05:58.688 --> 01:05:59.950
<i>Where is it?</i>

01:06:00.022 --> 01:06:02.217
Where was it? They closed it down.

01:06:02.291 --> 01:06:04.486
But it was in New York.
It's where the Mayflower used to be.

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:06.653
<i>The Mayflower? The department store?</i>

01:06:06.729 --> 01:06:09.027
Do you have any idea where
they would store records for a hospital

01:06:09.098 --> 01:06:11.293
that's been closed for over 50 years?

01:06:11.367 --> 01:06:13.835
<i>No, I don't. But I can send someone
to city hall to check it out.</i>

01:06:13.903 --> 01:06:17.839
<i>If it's a public hospital, there'd be a record
of it. Tell me exactly what you need.</i>

01:06:17.907 --> 01:06:21.536
Same thing. I'm looking for a patient
or an employee with the name Esseker.

01:06:21.611 --> 01:06:26.207
<i>All right, I'm on it. Give me a couple hours,
and, Ben, keep your head down.</i>

01:06:49.105 --> 01:06:50.129
Hey.

01:06:50.206 --> 01:06:52.674
- Did you get it?
- Yeah, I think so.

01:06:53.476 --> 01:06:56.502
It's Anna Esseker.

01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:00.444
I didn't really know what you wanted,
so I got all the medical files.

01:07:00.516 --> 01:07:03.576
This is perfect, Larry. This is perfect.

01:07:03.653 --> 01:07:06.520
What happened?
Did you get in an accident?

01:07:06.589 --> 01:07:08.784
Anna Esseker's file,
did you have to go to city hall for it?

01:07:08.858 --> 01:07:10.257
No, I didn't have to go anywhere.

01:07:10.326 --> 01:07:13.295
All the files in that place were in storage
with the cold-case evidence.

01:07:13.362 --> 01:07:14.522
Why, because of the fire?

01:07:14.597 --> 01:07:18.260
No, it's before the fire.
It's a totally different case.

01:07:18.935 --> 01:07:20.596
Anna was a patient at St. Matthew's.

01:07:20.670 --> 01:07:23.298
She was in the psych ward
run by a Dr. Kane.

01:07:23.372 --> 01:07:26.500
Now get this,
she was only 12 years old when she died.

01:07:26.575 --> 01:07:27.564
What?

01:07:27.643 --> 01:07:31.602
When the nurses went on their rounds
first thing in the morning, October 6, 1952,

01:07:31.681 --> 01:07:34.673
they discovered that all the patients
had left their rooms during the night,

01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:36.741
and they'd all gathered in the main hall.

01:07:36.819 --> 01:07:39.413
Ben, they were all dead, including the girl.

01:07:39.488 --> 01:07:42.980
Apparently, they killed each other.
I mean, it was a slaughterhouse.

01:07:43.059 --> 01:07:45.425
That's when they closed the place down.
Who knows what really happened?

01:07:45.494 --> 01:07:47.860
- What about the doctor? Kane?
- Well, they arrested him.

01:07:47.930 --> 01:07:49.795
They found him dead
first day of the hearing.

01:07:49.865 --> 01:07:53.323
He slashed his wrists
with a piece of the cell mirror.

01:07:54.603 --> 01:07:57.265
- Thanks for your help.
- Good luck.

01:08:03.512 --> 01:08:04.740
Damn it!

01:08:41.617 --> 01:08:42.913
Jesus.

01:08:59.135 --> 01:09:00.796
"October 6, 1952."

01:09:05.274 --> 01:09:08.801
"Anna Esseker is diagnosed with
severe schizophrenia,

01:09:08.877 --> 01:09:13.178
"leading to withdrawal from reality,
delusional and violent behavior."

01:09:24.026 --> 01:09:26.654
"Pennsylvania, August 1951."

01:09:45.381 --> 01:09:46.848
They don't match.

01:09:49.085 --> 01:09:53.215
Anna Esseker was discharged
from St. Matthew's Hospital October 4.

01:09:53.288 --> 01:09:55.450
Two days before the massacre.

01:10:17.713 --> 01:10:19.943
She's alive, isn't she?

01:10:34.530 --> 01:10:37.897
You almost done, sweetie? Okay.

01:10:37.967 --> 01:10:42.404
Why is Daddy acting so scared?
It's not normal.

01:10:43.973 --> 01:10:46.771
He's way older than me.

01:10:47.343 --> 01:10:50.904
And I'm not acting scared, but he is.

01:10:52.181 --> 01:10:56.811
- Doesn't make any sense.
- Michael? What are you doing?

01:10:57.887 --> 01:10:59.081
Nothing.

01:10:59.922 --> 01:11:03.585
- Okay, well, we gotta get going, all right?
- Okay.

01:11:36.692 --> 01:11:39.183
<i>- Amy? Amy, what's wrong?
- Ben.</i>

01:11:39.261 --> 01:11:42.094
You have to come
to the house right now.

01:11:42.164 --> 01:11:43.756
I'm so scared.

01:11:43.832 --> 01:11:46.733
<i>- Amy, what's wrong?
- I'm so scared.</i>

01:11:46.802 --> 01:11:50.033
<i>- Amy, just tell me what happened.
- There's something in the house.</i>

01:11:51.607 --> 01:11:54.235
<i>- Something in the mirrors.
- I'm on my way.</i>

01:11:54.877 --> 01:11:56.367
God damn it!

01:12:02.818 --> 01:12:04.046
Come on.

01:12:54.770 --> 01:13:00.402
- Dad? When are you coming back home?
- Really soon, sweetheart. Come here.

01:13:03.712 --> 01:13:06.408
- I love you, Daddy.
- I love you, too, sweetheart.

01:13:06.482 --> 01:13:08.040
I gotta go.

01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:10.347
I'm afraid to stay here.

01:13:10.419 --> 01:13:12.387
There's gonna be windows and mirrors
wherever you go.

01:13:12.454 --> 01:13:14.888
Anything that causes a reflection
right now is dangerous.

01:13:14.957 --> 01:13:16.982
At least inside the house
we've covered everything.

01:13:17.059 --> 01:13:19.220
It's the safest place to be.

01:13:20.129 --> 01:13:21.255
Amy, I'm so sorry.

01:13:21.397 --> 01:13:24.855
No. It's not your fault.
I should've believed you.

01:13:26.602 --> 01:13:27.933
Come here.

01:13:31.874 --> 01:13:34.900
Ben, you do whatever it takes to end this.

01:13:36.078 --> 01:13:38.512
- You hear me?
- I will.

01:13:40.516 --> 01:13:42.313
I'll be right back.

01:15:37.966 --> 01:15:39.524
Jesus.

01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:43.094
Yes, sir?

01:15:43.172 --> 01:15:46.664
Excuse me. Is this the Esseker farm?

01:15:46.742 --> 01:15:49.438
- What is it, Jimmy?
- I don't know, Ma.

01:15:50.012 --> 01:15:54.176
- What can I do for you, sir?
- I'm looking for Anna. Anna Esseker.

01:15:54.883 --> 01:15:57.511
There's a man looking for...
You said Anna?

01:15:57.586 --> 01:15:59.213
Yes, Anna Esseker.

01:15:59.288 --> 01:16:01.222
An Anna Esseker, Ma.

01:16:02.991 --> 01:16:06.825
Look, I'm sorry to bother you.
I must have the wrong place.

01:16:08.330 --> 01:16:09.661
What is it you want with Anna Esseker?

01:16:17.573 --> 01:16:20.406
I'm doing a research paper
on schizophrenia.

01:16:20.476 --> 01:16:23.070
I became familiar with
Anna Esseker's case.

01:16:23.145 --> 01:16:25.477
I just wanted to ask her some questions.

01:16:26.915 --> 01:16:30.681
Go tell Grandpa there's a man here
who's asking about his sister.

01:16:30.752 --> 01:16:31.946
Okay.

01:16:32.588 --> 01:16:34.055
Thank you.

01:16:34.122 --> 01:16:35.419
Grandpa?

01:16:37.059 --> 01:16:39.254
You know, up to this day,

01:16:39.328 --> 01:16:42.729
visions of Anna's fits
still haunt me at night.

01:16:44.199 --> 01:16:49.102
I helped my father fix up this part
of the basement especially for her.

01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:53.208
Her fits were too violent.

01:16:53.275 --> 01:16:56.176
<i>My mother couldn't
take her screams anymore.</i>

01:17:04.386 --> 01:17:09.847
We had every priest, doctor, healer,
coming in from all over the county,

01:17:09.925 --> 01:17:11.893
but no one could help her.

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:32.278
So finally, a Dr. Kane from New York
answered my parents' cries for help.

01:17:34.483 --> 01:17:38.419
He rejected the idea of demonic
possession, said he didn't believe in it.

01:17:38.487 --> 01:17:43.117
He was convinced Anna suffered from
a rare form of personality disorder

01:17:44.293 --> 01:17:46.659
and mirrors could help her.

01:17:47.563 --> 01:17:51.055
He wanted Anna under his care,
at St. Matthew's.

01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:54.227
My parents were very poor,

01:17:54.303 --> 01:17:57.704
but he agreed to cover all the costs
of the hospital.

01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:00.333
Where did she go after the hospital?

01:18:00.409 --> 01:18:01.808
Don't you know?

01:18:01.877 --> 01:18:04.505
She died there
with all of Kane's other patients.

01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:07.014
Mr. Esseker, I read the file.

01:18:07.082 --> 01:18:09.812
Anna left the hospital
two days before the massacre.

01:18:09.885 --> 01:18:13.377
Dr. Kane altered the documents
so she could disappear.

01:18:15.524 --> 01:18:17.048
Where did you get that document?

01:18:17.125 --> 01:18:20.583
I need you to tell me where she went
after St. Matthew's.

01:18:21.296 --> 01:18:23.662
She came back
and stayed with us for a while.

01:18:23.732 --> 01:18:27.998
What do you mean for a while?
What happened? Why did she leave?

01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:30.834
- I don't want to talk about that.
- Why did she leave?

01:18:32.341 --> 01:18:35.071
Because strange things
started to happen in the house.

01:18:35.143 --> 01:18:36.167
With Anna?

01:18:36.244 --> 01:18:39.702
No, no, not with Anna anymore.
No, she was totally cured.

01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:45.277
Strange things started to happen
with the mirrors, didn't they?

01:18:45.354 --> 01:18:48.653
Mr. Esseker, I need to know where Anna
is now. It's a matter of life and death.

01:18:48.724 --> 01:18:51.056
Do not make me threaten you.

01:18:51.126 --> 01:18:56.120
We sent her somewhere
where mirrors are forbidden.

01:18:57.199 --> 01:19:01.067
- Where the mirrors couldn't find her.
- Where? Where?

01:19:02.237 --> 01:19:05.604
St. Augustine's Monastery,
on the road to Reedfield.

01:20:08.203 --> 01:20:09.898
How can I help you?

01:20:11.339 --> 01:20:12.863
I'm sorry to disturb you, Sister,

01:20:12.941 --> 01:20:17.207
but I've come to speak with a member
of your community. Anna Esseker.

01:20:17.612 --> 01:20:19.671
Is she expecting you?

01:20:19.948 --> 01:20:21.245
No, not really.

01:20:21.316 --> 01:20:24.183
If you're not listed, I cannot help you, sir.

01:20:24.252 --> 01:20:28.348
Can you at least tell her
that I've come from New York

01:20:28.924 --> 01:20:30.448
to speak with her?

01:20:30.525 --> 01:20:33.790
I work with Dr. Kane
from St. Matthew's Hospital.

01:20:34.663 --> 01:20:36.858
It's very important, please.

01:20:42.771 --> 01:20:47.003
St. Matthew's closed down in 1952.
Who are you?

01:20:47.075 --> 01:20:49.236
My name is Benjamin Carson.

01:20:49.678 --> 01:20:53.478
I work as a night watchman
on Sixth Avenue in New York City

01:20:53.548 --> 01:20:56.847
in the building that used to be
St. Matthew's Hospital.

01:20:56.918 --> 01:20:59.478
What is it you want, Mr. Carson?

01:20:59.888 --> 01:21:01.753
My family is in danger,

01:21:01.823 --> 01:21:04.451
and what's threatening them
is asking for you.

01:21:04.526 --> 01:21:08.724
I came all this way to ask you

01:21:08.797 --> 01:21:11.027
why the mirrors that were left over
from St. Matthew's Hospital

01:21:11.099 --> 01:21:13.363
are so desperate to find you.

01:21:14.669 --> 01:21:16.398
Please, Miss Esseker.

01:21:17.038 --> 01:21:18.801
If you don't help me,

01:21:18.874 --> 01:21:21.206
I'm gonna lose the most important thing
to me in this world,

01:21:21.276 --> 01:21:22.971
and that's my family.

01:21:26.615 --> 01:21:28.549
Sit down, Mr. Carson.

01:21:37.626 --> 01:21:40.595
The mirrors are merely windows
on our world.

01:21:41.863 --> 01:21:44.730
It is not the wish of the mirrors to find me

01:21:45.801 --> 01:21:48.736
but of what is imprisoned inside them.

01:21:48.804 --> 01:21:50.897
What is imprisoned inside them?

01:21:52.274 --> 01:21:55.801
At the time that I was at St. Matthew's,

01:21:56.812 --> 01:22:00.407
<i>Dr. Kane's therapy
for personality disorders</i>

01:22:00.482 --> 01:22:05.351
<i>consisted of locking the patient up
in a mirrored room</i>

01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:11.586
<i>for several days on end,
forcing them to confront their own image.</i>

01:22:13.829 --> 01:22:17.060
<i>Dr. Kane was wrong about his theory.</i>

01:22:17.566 --> 01:22:21.263
<i>There is no cure for schizophrenia,
Mr. Carson.</i>

01:22:24.372 --> 01:22:26.806
It was something else.

01:22:27.475 --> 01:22:33.539
<i>And whatever it was,
it left me and entered the mirrors.</i>

01:22:35.417 --> 01:22:36.816
Since that day,

01:22:36.885 --> 01:22:40.480
it has been collecting
the souls of the people it kills.

01:22:41.523 --> 01:22:43.684
I'm sorry,

01:22:43.758 --> 01:22:47.091
but if I agree to go with you
and return back to that place,

01:22:47.162 --> 01:22:48.891
I will make it possible for the demon

01:22:48.964 --> 01:22:51.831
to cross the threshold
back into the real world.

01:22:51.933 --> 01:22:54.458
Do you understand
what that means for my family?

01:22:54.536 --> 01:22:57.664
You can't do this.
You need to come back with me.

01:22:58.506 --> 01:23:01.475
I'm going to pray for you and your family.

01:23:01.543 --> 01:23:05.104
That's all I can do right now, Mr. Carson.
I'm sorry.

01:23:06.681 --> 01:23:08.376
God bless you.

01:23:09.584 --> 01:23:14.817
Gary Lewis, Terrence Berry and many
other men have died trying to find you.

01:23:14.890 --> 01:23:17.085
And because they failed,
their families died, too.

01:23:17.158 --> 01:23:19.786
Two days ago my sister was murdered.

01:23:20.428 --> 01:23:23.454
My family will be next
if you don't help me.

01:23:23.899 --> 01:23:25.264
Please.

01:23:25.333 --> 01:23:28.564
Please. Wait, wait.

01:23:32.173 --> 01:23:33.606
This is my family.

01:23:33.675 --> 01:23:35.575
This is my wife Amy

01:23:35.644 --> 01:23:38.408
and my daughter Daisy
and my son Michael.

01:23:39.214 --> 01:23:40.909
They're beautiful.

01:23:41.383 --> 01:23:44.409
They're innocent.
They've never hurt anybody.

01:23:46.521 --> 01:23:47.954
Please.

01:23:48.290 --> 01:23:49.780
Take the photo.

01:23:51.293 --> 01:23:53.022
Just take the photo.

01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:03.560
Look at them.

01:24:06.574 --> 01:24:08.041
I'm sorry.

01:24:10.545 --> 01:24:13.013
Who the hell do you think you are?

01:24:13.281 --> 01:24:15.078
They're just kids!

01:24:53.188 --> 01:24:54.587
<i>- Hello?
- Amy.</i>

01:24:54.656 --> 01:24:57.250
<i>- Ben, where are you?
- At the monastery.</i>

01:24:57.726 --> 01:24:59.557
<i>- Did you find her?
- Yes.</i>

01:24:59.627 --> 01:25:01.652
Yeah? Did you talk to...

01:25:02.297 --> 01:25:04.424
<i>- Amy?
- Michael?</i>

01:25:06.101 --> 01:25:07.500
Michael?

01:25:07.736 --> 01:25:09.897
<i>Ben, hold on, Michael's gone.</i>

01:25:09.971 --> 01:25:11.233
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

01:25:11.306 --> 01:25:13.706
I fell asleep with the kids on the bed
and now I don't know where he is.

01:25:13.775 --> 01:25:14.833
<i>Michael?</i>

01:25:14.909 --> 01:25:16.308
Amy, what's going on?
Is everything all right?

01:25:17.779 --> 01:25:18.837
Oh, fuck.

01:25:19.581 --> 01:25:21.139
Amy, what's going on?
Have you got Michael?

01:25:22.584 --> 01:25:23.812
Oh, my God.

01:25:24.686 --> 01:25:27.314
Ben, there's water everywhere.

01:25:28.356 --> 01:25:29.345
Oh, my God.

01:25:29.457 --> 01:25:33.154
<i>You've got to be careful of the water.
It creates reflections.</i>

01:25:33.962 --> 01:25:36.192
Someone is in the house.

01:25:36.264 --> 01:25:37.959
Someone scraped all the mirrors!

01:25:38.033 --> 01:25:39.625
Amy, where is Michael?

01:25:39.701 --> 01:25:42.363
I don't know. I don't know where he is.
I don't see him anywhere.

01:25:42.437 --> 01:25:44.268
<i>Amy, listen to me,
you've gotta stay away from the water.</i>

01:25:44.339 --> 01:25:47.069
<i>Get the kids
and stay away from the water!</i>

01:25:47.542 --> 01:25:49.635
<i>- Michael?
- Amy?</i>

01:25:49.711 --> 01:25:52.009
Amy? Shit!

01:26:00.722 --> 01:26:03.589
Which room is she in? Which one?

01:26:07.829 --> 01:26:10.525
My family is not dying tonight.
You are coming with me.

01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:26.574
Michael?

01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:46.528
Daisy?

01:26:49.604 --> 01:26:51.265
Daisy, come here.

01:27:05.286 --> 01:27:06.844
Come here, Daisy.

01:27:08.189 --> 01:27:09.247
Mom?

01:27:15.763 --> 01:27:17.230
Come here, sweetheart.

01:27:36.918 --> 01:27:38.818
What are you doing in there?

01:27:40.755 --> 01:27:43.087
Everything's going to be all right.

01:27:57.305 --> 01:27:58.863
No!

01:28:02.243 --> 01:28:04.677
No! No!

01:28:04.746 --> 01:28:05.906
Daisy!

01:28:08.983 --> 01:28:11.042
Come here! Get down!
Get down, right now!

01:28:11.119 --> 01:28:14.054
Get down, sweetie. Get down.
Oh, my God, are you okay?

01:28:14.122 --> 01:28:17.614
Oh, my God! Stay right there.
Don't move, baby! Don't move!

01:28:17.692 --> 01:28:20.126
- Mom, why did you do that to me?
- It wasn't me, sweetheart.

01:28:20.195 --> 01:28:22.129
You know I would never hurt you.
You know that.

01:28:22.197 --> 01:28:24.529
Here. Hold this. Hold it tight.

01:28:25.967 --> 01:28:26.991
Okay?

01:28:29.871 --> 01:28:33.238
Here, get down, sweetie.
Let me see. Let me see.

01:28:35.143 --> 01:28:37.373
Let me see, sweetie. It's gonna be okay.

01:28:37.445 --> 01:28:40.505
All right? I know it hurts. Stay right there.

01:28:42.584 --> 01:28:46.020
All right. Give me your hand.
I need you to hold it really tight, okay?

01:28:46.087 --> 01:28:48.612
Just flat and tight, just like that. Okay.

01:28:48.690 --> 01:28:51.989
Now, I need you to listen to me,
okay, baby?

01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:53.960
- You have to be very brave.
- Okay.

01:28:54.028 --> 01:28:55.825
I need you to stay here
no matter what happens.

01:28:55.897 --> 01:28:59.458
No matter what you hear. Do not move
from this closet until I come back.

01:28:59.534 --> 01:29:01.001
- You understand me, right?
- Yes.

01:29:01.069 --> 01:29:03.867
Okay. Okay.

01:29:03.938 --> 01:29:06.065
Do not move. I love you.

01:29:07.508 --> 01:29:08.634
Don't move.

01:29:36.404 --> 01:29:37.735
Michael?

01:29:55.490 --> 01:29:56.787
Michael?

01:29:59.961 --> 01:30:01.292
Where are you?

01:30:03.731 --> 01:30:04.993
Michael?

01:30:22.917 --> 01:30:24.179
Michael!

01:30:24.819 --> 01:30:26.980
Michael, what are you doing?

01:30:31.159 --> 01:30:35.323
Don't be scared, Mommy.
He just wants to play with us.

01:30:35.730 --> 01:30:39.063
Michael, I want you to drop that knife,
right now.

01:30:39.133 --> 01:30:40.657
Do you hear me?

01:30:41.736 --> 01:30:45.968
You know very well you're not allowed
to play with knives. Don't you?

01:30:48.076 --> 01:30:49.270
Come on.

01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:54.609
That's a good boy.

01:30:54.982 --> 01:30:57.075
Give me the knife, Michael.

01:30:57.685 --> 01:30:59.653
Michael! Michael!

01:31:02.724 --> 01:31:04.123
Michael?

01:31:12.166 --> 01:31:13.428
Michael!

01:31:14.602 --> 01:31:15.933
Michael!

01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:21.073
Michael?

01:31:22.677 --> 01:31:24.201
Michael.

01:31:25.580 --> 01:31:26.911
Michael?

01:31:27.715 --> 01:31:30.411
Why are you hiding from me, sweetheart?

01:31:42.063 --> 01:31:43.553
Michael?

01:32:35.983 --> 01:32:38.918
You okay? Come on.

01:33:25.933 --> 01:33:28.401
It's waiting for me downstairs.

01:33:37.712 --> 01:33:41.978
Bring me inside. From now on,
I have to keep my eyes closed.

01:33:42.783 --> 01:33:45.581
Step up. You're in the room.

01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:47.815
Strap me in.

01:33:56.797 --> 01:33:59.527
I spent the darkest days of my life
in this room.

01:34:02.603 --> 01:34:04.093
Are you sure there's no other way?

01:34:04.171 --> 01:34:06.765
This is for your family, Mr. Carson.

01:34:08.142 --> 01:34:09.803
For your family.

01:34:23.925 --> 01:34:25.290
Michael?

01:35:09.503 --> 01:35:11.767
Michael? Michael, look at me.

01:35:14.308 --> 01:35:17.072
Michael! No, Michael!

01:35:17.578 --> 01:35:21.537
No! Give him back to me! Give him back!

01:35:23.317 --> 01:35:24.841
No!

01:35:26.354 --> 01:35:28.584
No! Get out!

01:35:28.656 --> 01:35:30.624
Come on, Michael!

01:35:30.691 --> 01:35:32.056
No!

01:35:32.126 --> 01:35:33.787
Please. Please.

01:35:36.230 --> 01:35:37.595
You must go now.

01:35:37.665 --> 01:35:39.098
Thank you.

01:35:40.034 --> 01:35:41.331
No!

01:35:45.539 --> 01:35:46.870
Why?

01:36:22.510 --> 01:36:24.569
Give him back, please!

01:36:24.645 --> 01:36:27.580
Give him back! Give him back!

01:36:28.482 --> 01:36:29.676
Michael!

01:36:31.585 --> 01:36:35.021
No! No!

01:36:59.447 --> 01:37:00.436
Michael?

01:37:00.514 --> 01:37:02.345
Oh, my baby!

01:37:27.975 --> 01:37:29.340
Come on.

01:37:31.779 --> 01:37:34.009
One, two, three...

01:37:41.489 --> 01:37:43.116
...five, six...

01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:47.693
Thank God!

01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:56.101
Thank you. I love you!

01:38:08.182 --> 01:38:09.274
Anna?

01:38:37.778 --> 01:38:39.109
Anna?

01:40:21.181 --> 01:40:23.081
Come out, you bitch!

01:42:34.815 --> 01:42:36.476
Oh, my God.

01:42:38.452 --> 01:42:40.181
Oh, my baby.

01:42:44.658 --> 01:42:46.285
I love you both.

01:42:54.435 --> 01:42:56.062
I love you, guys.
