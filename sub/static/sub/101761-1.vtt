00:39.406 --> 00:41.809
I can't believe you still have
to stuff your bra, Sommer.

00:41.843 --> 00:44.011
Everybody doesn't
have boobs yet, Brandi.

00:44.045 --> 00:46.413
True. Not everybody can be me.

00:46.446 --> 00:47.982
Plus, Mike's going to be there,

00:48.015 --> 00:49.917
and I'm trying
to lose it tonight.

00:49.951 --> 00:51.751
You're such a whore.

00:51.785 --> 00:54.856
Okay, guys. Come on. Focus.

00:54.889 --> 00:56.656
- Are we all good?
- Yeah.

00:56.690 --> 00:58.893
- Yeah.
- I don't know, Brandi.

00:58.926 --> 01:00.694
Don't you think
it's a little mean?

01:00.727 --> 01:03.064
I mean, everyone already
picks on him all the time.

01:03.097 --> 01:06.901
Really, Nicole? You know what?
Forget it. I'll just do it.

01:06.934 --> 01:09.804
You can be left out
while we have all the fun.

01:09.837 --> 01:11.038
Right, ladies?

01:11.072 --> 01:12.173
- Right.
- Right.

01:12.206 --> 01:15.508
No, no, no. I'm in. I'll do it.

01:15.542 --> 01:18.645
Okay. I knew you weren't stupid.

01:18.678 --> 01:21.082
Okay, everybody. Hands in.

01:21.115 --> 01:24.417
From this night on, you swear to
make a pact to never let boys,

01:24.451 --> 01:28.089
teachers, parents, anyone,
or anything come between us.

01:28.122 --> 01:29.156
Got it?

01:29.190 --> 01:30.724
- Got it.
- Got it.

01:30.757 --> 01:33.961
Whatever happens to us,
we stick together.

01:33.995 --> 01:36.496
Our bond is always
and forever.

01:38.698 --> 01:40.067
Come on.

01:40.101 --> 01:41.434
Say it!

01:41.468 --> 01:43.637
Always and forever.

02:48.535 --> 02:50.071
Hey, hey.

02:50.104 --> 02:52.605
Mom. Hey.

03:11.192 --> 03:13.995
Son, I am so proud of you.

03:14.028 --> 03:16.297
You are everything I hoped for
and even more.

03:16.330 --> 03:19.566
You just make a mother so proud.

03:19.599 --> 03:21.836
Testing, hello.

03:21.869 --> 03:27.274
I just want to say
how truly lucky I am

03:27.308 --> 03:29.642
to have found
this woman of my dreams.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.849
I will love you always
and forever.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.262
Wedding parties do a video.

03:48.295 --> 03:50.097
Hey, hey.

03:50.131 --> 03:53.566
This is my wife now. Back up.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.269
Nicole, what can I say?

03:55.302 --> 03:58.939
You are a princess and Brian,
he's just...

03:58.973 --> 04:01.574
he is Prince Charming, girl.

04:01.608 --> 04:03.110
Hey.

04:12.386 --> 04:14.721
Oh, I just want to say
that I am so happy for you.

04:14.754 --> 04:16.089
You've finally got
what you wanted.

04:16.123 --> 04:19.026
He put a ring on it,
as you deserve.

04:19.060 --> 04:20.593
Just want you to know
that I'm next

04:20.627 --> 04:23.297
and you will be
at my wedding very soon.

04:28.402 --> 04:30.037
Hey, beautiful. It's Sommer.

04:30.071 --> 04:32.073
I just want to wish you
many years of happiness,

04:32.106 --> 04:34.641
and I love you so much.

05:10.677 --> 05:11.979
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

05:15.449 --> 05:17.952
What's wrong?

05:17.985 --> 05:19.887
Nothing.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.155
You know I know you

05:21.188 --> 05:22.890
better than you know yourself,
right?

05:22.923 --> 05:24.425
Come on.

05:24.458 --> 05:26.693
Well then you would know
that I hate it

05:26.726 --> 05:28.761
when you are gone so much.

05:28.795 --> 05:30.331
Babe, we talked about this.

05:30.364 --> 05:32.867
And you know I would have
never even taken that job

05:32.900 --> 05:34.268
if I knew how it was
going to affect you.

05:34.301 --> 05:37.037
I know. It's just
we've both been really busy

05:37.071 --> 05:39.140
and I feel like we haven't been
able to spend any time together.

05:39.173 --> 05:40.941
- I miss you.
- You miss me.

05:40.975 --> 05:42.376
- Yeah.
- Mmm.

05:42.409 --> 05:45.012
- Well, guess what?
- What?

05:45.045 --> 05:48.949
Think I can skip this trip, and
you can have me all to yourself.

05:48.983 --> 05:51.886
- I like that.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

05:53.888 --> 05:55.222
Think I'll be a little late.

06:00.928 --> 06:03.931
Tall mocha latte with soy
and a pinch of vanilla.

06:03.964 --> 06:07.401
I know. Are you ever
going to change your order?

06:07.434 --> 06:09.370
At least you know
I'm consistent.

06:09.403 --> 06:11.138
That is true.

06:14.241 --> 06:15.976
Here you go,
and it'll be right out.

06:16.010 --> 06:18.279
- Thank you very much.
- No problem.

06:18.312 --> 06:19.779
Hi.

06:29.756 --> 06:30.858
Nicole?

06:30.891 --> 06:33.961
Oh, my God, Miranda.

06:33.994 --> 06:35.728
- How are you?
- How are you?

06:35.762 --> 06:37.131
Good to see you.
What are you...

06:37.164 --> 06:38.832
Look at you.
First of all, you look amazing.

06:38.866 --> 06:40.834
- Sit down, sit down, please.
- Oh, thank you.

06:40.868 --> 06:42.303
What are you doing here?

06:42.336 --> 06:45.105
Oh, I just came back
from South Africa.

06:45.139 --> 06:47.808
South Africa?
What were you doing there?

06:47.841 --> 06:50.743
Apparently saving animals
has become my life passion now.

06:50.777 --> 06:52.213
- What?
- Can you believe it?

06:52.246 --> 06:55.049
- I know, right?
- Wow, that's amazing.

06:55.082 --> 06:57.384
And I met a guy.
He's a doctor.

06:57.418 --> 06:59.253
I know. Can you believe it? Me?

06:59.286 --> 07:01.922
I never did nerds,
and here I am.

07:01.956 --> 07:05.159
How about you? I haven't
seen you since the wedding.

07:05.192 --> 07:07.928
Married life is everything
I could have asked for

07:07.962 --> 07:09.196
and then some.

07:09.230 --> 07:10.763
You'll have to
come by the house.

07:10.797 --> 07:12.466
Any time.
Number's still the same?

07:12.499 --> 07:13.901
- Yes, yes.
- Okay.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.236
Please call me
so we can catch up.

07:15.269 --> 07:17.004
Definitely.
So good to see you.

07:17.037 --> 07:19.006
- It's good to see you too.
- I'mma let you back to work.

07:19.039 --> 07:21.141
- Alright. Bye, Miranda.
- Bye.

07:34.822 --> 07:39.159
Whoo!
This is going to look so good.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.832
Oh, we gonna get some tonight.

07:45.566 --> 07:49.903
Ohh.

07:51.338 --> 07:53.540
Stupid alarm.

08:17.631 --> 08:19.500
Stupid car.

08:34.181 --> 08:35.883
Hello?

08:44.992 --> 08:46.527
Hello?

08:55.536 --> 08:58.372
No, no, no. No, no, no.

09:08.382 --> 09:09.917
<i>What up? It's D.
You got me.</i>

09:09.950 --> 09:11.218
<i>Leave your message at the beep.</i>

10:20.587 --> 10:22.356
No!

10:23.624 --> 10:25.459
Help!

10:53.053 --> 10:55.656
<i>In other news,
a woman found dead</i>

10:55.689 --> 10:58.058
<i>at her Los Angeles home
last night.</i>

10:58.091 --> 11:00.661
<i>Sources say it was a suicide.</i>

11:00.694 --> 11:03.230
- <i>Back you, John.</i>
- Oh, my God.

11:03.263 --> 11:04.665
<i>There are growing
questions about possible...</i>

11:07.267 --> 11:09.536
Hey. You okay?

11:09.570 --> 11:12.172
Yeah.

11:12.206 --> 11:14.341
When was the last time
you saw her?

11:14.374 --> 11:17.010
Just yesterday at the cafÃ©.

11:17.044 --> 11:19.146
Oh.

11:19.179 --> 11:24.384
Suicide? I mean, I just would
never have expected that.

11:24.418 --> 11:25.752
She seemed so happy.

11:25.786 --> 11:28.055
She was raving about this doctor
she'd just met

11:28.088 --> 11:31.225
and how she wanted to
get married and everything.

11:31.258 --> 11:33.760
Mm.

11:33.794 --> 11:37.464
Well, how about this, hmm?

11:37.498 --> 11:42.469
You stop thinking about it,
we order your favorite Chinese,

11:42.503 --> 11:44.771
maybe watch a movie, talk,

11:44.806 --> 11:47.774
get your mind off
the stress of the day?

11:47.809 --> 11:52.145
I like that.

11:52.179 --> 11:54.681
- I love you.
- I love you too.

12:25.779 --> 12:27.548
I just can't believe she's gone.

12:27.581 --> 12:31.385
It's unbelievable.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.587
I'm just like...

12:33.620 --> 12:35.823
Is that Brandi?

12:35.857 --> 12:37.859
Oh.

12:37.892 --> 12:41.863
Brandi Smith.
What a pleasant surprise.

12:41.896 --> 12:44.832
It is nice to see you too,
Sommer.

12:44.866 --> 12:47.134
I see not much has changed.

12:49.904 --> 12:53.473
It's good to see you guys
after all this time.

12:53.507 --> 12:55.676
Sorry I couldn't come
to your wedding, Nicole.

12:55.709 --> 12:57.344
You know, traveling the world,
you know.

12:57.377 --> 13:00.681
Totally understandable.

13:00.714 --> 13:03.250
This must be the lucky guy?

13:03.283 --> 13:06.153
Yes. Brandi, Brian.

13:06.186 --> 13:07.487
Nice to meet you.

13:07.521 --> 13:09.623
Nice to meet you too.

13:09.656 --> 13:13.260
Unfortunate it has
to be this circumstance.

13:13.293 --> 13:16.363
Yeah, it is.

13:16.396 --> 13:17.731
She was good people.

13:19.733 --> 13:21.468
- She was.
- Yeah.

13:25.172 --> 13:26.908
Well, here.

13:26.941 --> 13:29.209
Hey, here's my card.

13:31.278 --> 13:35.415
You both should stop
by the boutique sometime.

13:35.449 --> 13:38.619
- That'd be nice.
- Yeah.

13:38.652 --> 13:40.253
See ya.

13:45.392 --> 13:47.461
Really?

13:47.494 --> 13:49.763
- I cannot stand that girl.
- I know, I know.

14:10.450 --> 14:13.720
- Thanks, babe.
- Yeah.

14:13.754 --> 14:17.491
I'm really sorry
about Miranda, babe.

14:17.524 --> 14:18.759
Yeah.

14:18.792 --> 14:21.695
Ahh.

14:21.728 --> 14:24.598
Please don't stop.
That feels amazing.

14:24.631 --> 14:26.299
Well, you know,
it'd feel a lot better

14:26.333 --> 14:28.468
if you came and got in bed.
It's pretty late.

14:28.502 --> 14:30.872
I know, I have... I have court
in the morning.

14:30.905 --> 14:33.273
I've got to get
this done tonight.

14:33.306 --> 14:37.511
Ah, that's crazy.
You work more than I do.

14:37.544 --> 14:40.313
Yeah, well, at least my job
keeps me in town.

14:43.017 --> 14:47.320
Alright, you got me on that one.

14:47.354 --> 14:51.224
Don't stay up too late, alright?

14:51.258 --> 14:55.629
- Okay.
- Alright.

14:55.662 --> 14:57.932
- I love you.
- Love you too.

15:02.669 --> 15:06.573
This man, Eric Johnson,

15:06.606 --> 15:10.945
violently took the life
of Jason Simone.

15:10.978 --> 15:16.316
Jason was a father,
he was a brother.

15:16.349 --> 15:21.488
He was also someone's son.

15:21.521 --> 15:24.324
Do any of you have children?

15:24.357 --> 15:26.259
What if someone
took away the right

15:26.293 --> 15:29.362
for you to hold
your child again?

15:29.396 --> 15:32.766
To tell them
that you love them.

15:32.799 --> 15:34.869
Now, think about
Jason's children.

15:34.902 --> 15:37.972
They now will have to
grow up without a father

15:38.005 --> 15:41.441
because Eric Johnson
took that from them.

15:43.443 --> 15:46.881
This man has no regard,

15:46.914 --> 15:50.484
no thought,

15:50.517 --> 15:53.553
no forgiveness in his heart.

15:53.587 --> 15:56.356
Now, he may not have had
a perfect childhood,

15:56.389 --> 15:58.625
but who does?

15:58.658 --> 16:02.596
We all go through things in life
that we wish we could fix,

16:02.629 --> 16:05.298
but that's life.

16:05.332 --> 16:08.401
And it does not give one
the right to take it away

16:08.435 --> 16:10.004
because you're not
happy with it.

16:12.840 --> 16:16.343
Thank you very much.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.883
This is $5,000 a bottle.

16:21.916 --> 16:25.385
You did this? Wow.

16:25.418 --> 16:26.753
I'm sure we can find
something sexier.

16:26.787 --> 16:28.022
Alright, this is on me.

16:28.055 --> 16:29.790
You did... is this you?

16:29.824 --> 16:31.391
- This is the really good stuff.
- You did this?

16:31.424 --> 16:33.727
This is the really good stuff.
Yeah, I did this.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.562
Thank you.

16:35.595 --> 16:38.532
By the way, you guys, I'm glad
we were finally able to do this.

16:38.565 --> 16:40.101
Cindy, it's nice
to finally meet you.

16:40.134 --> 16:42.036
And it is so good
to meet you, Nicole.

16:42.069 --> 16:44.806
Roger is always
bragging about you.

16:44.839 --> 16:47.574
I've heard nothing but the best
things about you as well.

16:47.607 --> 16:49.010
Oh, I doubt it.

16:49.043 --> 16:51.813
Roger doesn't say nice things
unless I pay him.

16:51.846 --> 16:53.981
Oh, come on. That's why
she's my best attorney.

16:54.015 --> 16:56.884
Knows exactly what to say
and when to say it.

16:56.918 --> 16:58.485
And, Brian, I've been
meaning to tell you,

16:58.518 --> 17:00.720
ever since you married her,

17:00.754 --> 17:03.124
she's been 10-0 in the
courthouse... never loses.

17:03.157 --> 17:04.723
- Wow.
- Never.

17:04.758 --> 17:05.926
You got it all wrong
though, man,

17:05.960 --> 17:07.661
it's her that makes me better.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.729
Babe, you know you make me...
you make me better, babe.

17:09.762 --> 17:11.364
- Babe, aw.
- Aw, look at it.

17:11.397 --> 17:13.599
Look at it. Look at it.

17:13.633 --> 17:17.604
- How did you guys meet?
- Well, we met on a dating app.

17:17.637 --> 17:20.440
- Dating... yeah.
- Really? What's that?

17:20.473 --> 17:22.642
I don't know what that is.
Sounds cool.

17:22.675 --> 17:24.145
- We didn't need that, dear.
- No, we didn't need that.

17:24.178 --> 17:27.380
But... But, you know, we still
instantly connected,

17:27.414 --> 17:30.584
and I remember when you first
walked into the coffee shop.

17:30.617 --> 17:33.453
- Yes.
- And I looked into your eyes,

17:33.486 --> 17:35.022
and I just knew.

17:35.056 --> 17:38.692
It was as if I'd known you
my whole life.

17:38.725 --> 17:41.162
Yeah, I mean, four months later,
we were married,

17:41.195 --> 17:43.865
and it's been nothing
but happiness ever since.

17:43.898 --> 17:46.934
Okay, a toast to success.

17:46.968 --> 17:48.401
- Yes.
- Success.

17:48.435 --> 17:50.770
- And happy marriage.
- Happy marriage.

17:50.805 --> 17:53.740
Yes. Let's keep those
wins rolling in.

17:53.773 --> 17:56.643
- Yes, please.
- Nice work.

17:56.676 --> 17:59.546
- Upsadaisy, here you go.
- Whoo, oh, my gosh.

17:59.579 --> 18:00.747
My wife is fine. She'll be okay.

18:00.780 --> 18:01.816
Should not have had
that last glass.

18:01.849 --> 18:03.516
Thank you, sir.

18:03.550 --> 18:04.618
- Are you alright?
- Yes.

18:04.651 --> 18:06.053
Safety, hoo!

18:08.722 --> 18:10.457
Now get, wait, wait,
wait, you go first.

18:10.490 --> 18:12.692
Oh, my, gosh,
help me up these stairs, please.

18:12.726 --> 18:16.163
Oh, man.

18:16.197 --> 18:17.832
Is the door open?

18:17.865 --> 18:19.934
Hold on.

18:27.041 --> 18:29.476
Oh, my God.

18:29.509 --> 18:30.610
Call 911, babe.

18:36.650 --> 18:39.086
Jesus Christ.

18:39.120 --> 18:42.156
Hi. Yes, um, I'd like to report
a break-in, please.

18:54.534 --> 18:56.037
Looks good.

18:57.071 --> 18:58.172
Thank you.

18:58.205 --> 19:00.440
We'll square right here.

19:02.176 --> 19:03.244
This is for you.

19:03.277 --> 19:07.882
- Thank you.
- Great job.

19:07.915 --> 19:09.083
What do we have here?

19:09.116 --> 19:11.584
What is this?

19:11.618 --> 19:13.486
- Mm-hmm?
- Okay, look, arm.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.555
- Arm, disarm.
- Disarm.

19:19.726 --> 19:21.728
One, two.

19:21.761 --> 19:23.530
One, two, three, two.

19:23.563 --> 19:24.564
Good. One.

19:24.597 --> 19:26.834
Two, three, two.

19:26.867 --> 19:27.935
Two, three, two.

19:27.969 --> 19:29.870
Two, three, two.

19:29.904 --> 19:31.105
- Hey, I'll be right with you.
- Hey, okay.

19:31.138 --> 19:33.573
One, two. One, two. Good.

19:33.606 --> 19:35.142
Cesar, do me a favor
and take over.

19:39.046 --> 19:40.047
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:40.081 --> 19:41.614
- Nicole, right?
- Yes.

19:41.648 --> 19:43.050
Great. How you doing?
Glad you showed up.

19:43.084 --> 19:45.920
- Let's go get some boxing in.
- Alright, yeah.

19:55.930 --> 19:57.664
Hey, I heard what
happened the other night.

19:57.697 --> 19:58.732
Are you guys okay?

19:58.765 --> 20:00.667
Yeah. Well, nothing was stolen.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.669
Brian had
a security system installed,

20:02.702 --> 20:04.071
so I think we'll be fine.

20:04.105 --> 20:05.940
Oh, my God, that is so scary.
I can't imagine.

20:05.973 --> 20:08.641
You know, my neighbor's car
got broken into the other day.

20:08.675 --> 20:10.177
Yes. People are crazy.

20:10.211 --> 20:13.014
Yeah, well, that's why
I started taking kickboxing.

20:13.047 --> 20:15.049
- I don't blame you.
- Yeah. I started yesterday.

20:15.082 --> 20:18.618
I mean, I gotta be able
to protect myself.

20:18.651 --> 20:20.121
And Brian.

20:20.154 --> 20:21.654
Shoot, I might need
to take some with you.

20:21.688 --> 20:23.656
Yeah, come.
It can't hurt, right?

20:23.690 --> 20:25.558
- No, I need to.
- Alright,

20:25.592 --> 20:26.861
so, what have you
got for me today, Tam?

20:26.894 --> 20:28.896
Okay, so Westfield
just filed a motion

20:28.929 --> 20:30.597
and the judge
granted that today.

20:30.630 --> 20:32.599
Harris is getting really,
really close on cracking in

20:32.632 --> 20:34.101
on that Johnson case.

20:34.135 --> 20:36.636
And Chris Simms called you twice
about the Kester case.

20:36.669 --> 20:39.639
- Call him back.
- Mrs. Taylor, Roger called.

20:39.672 --> 20:42.143
He needs you to cover
for him today.

20:42.176 --> 20:44.178
Well, he's got that mediation
at 8:00.

20:44.211 --> 20:45.913
That's in 30 minutes.

20:45.946 --> 20:48.715
You know, Roger really
gets on my nerves.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.051
I'll be in my office
if you need me.

20:50.084 --> 20:51.952
- Thanks, Tam.
- You're welcome.

21:13.874 --> 21:15.009
Hey.

21:15.042 --> 21:16.310
Hey, baby.
You want some breakfast?

21:16.343 --> 21:18.946
Hey. No, I'm good.
Why are you dressed?

21:18.979 --> 21:20.747
I have an emergency
meeting in Phoenix.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.782
- About this new project.
- What?

21:22.817 --> 21:24.919
Actually, Jesus,
I got to run.

21:24.952 --> 21:26.854
My flight's in like two hours.
I got to get to the airport.

21:26.887 --> 21:28.923
H-Hold on.
When did this happen?

21:28.956 --> 21:30.124
I just found out last night.

21:30.157 --> 21:32.393
You told me
you were off last night.

21:32.426 --> 21:34.295
Okay, well, are you forgetting
about your mother's barbecue

21:34.328 --> 21:36.130
that we're supposed
to go to this weekend?

21:36.163 --> 21:37.630
- You can still go.
- What?

21:37.664 --> 21:39.166
- Yeah.
- No.

21:39.200 --> 21:40.700
I'm not going near that woman.
Your mother hates me.

21:40.733 --> 21:41.969
She doesn't hate... Stop.

21:42.002 --> 21:43.304
She doesn't hate you.
She loves you.

21:43.337 --> 21:44.839
Once I move up in the company,

21:44.872 --> 21:46.874
I'll be in more control
of my schedule.

21:46.907 --> 21:49.276
But for now,
I'm on their clock, okay?

21:49.310 --> 21:53.881
Hey, I mean, I could quit
if you want me to.

21:53.914 --> 21:57.151
- I could do that.
- No, it's just that, you know,

21:57.184 --> 21:58.886
I wish you wouldn't
leave me here by myself

21:58.919 --> 22:00.620
after what happened.

22:03.124 --> 22:07.261
I promise I will
make it up to you,

22:07.294 --> 22:09.130
just as soon as I get home.

22:09.163 --> 22:10.931
Hmm?

22:10.965 --> 22:13.000
- You'd better.
- Oh, I better?

22:13.033 --> 22:14.902
- Yeah, you better.
- Oh, come on now, babe.

22:14.935 --> 22:16.337
You know I just put it on
last night

22:16.370 --> 22:20.673
with the candles and bubble bath
and all that, hmm?

22:20.707 --> 22:23.177
Hmm? You know your boy know
what you're doing.

22:23.210 --> 22:27.348
- Go catch your flight.
- Okay.

22:27.381 --> 22:28.983
Be good.

22:29.016 --> 22:30.317
That's good food in there.
Eat that.

22:30.351 --> 22:32.253
Oh, wait.

22:32.286 --> 22:34.989
- Oh.
- Forgot something.

22:35.022 --> 22:36.290
Love you.

22:36.323 --> 22:38.392
- Love you.
- Love you too.

22:38.425 --> 22:39.894
Be good, be good, be good.

22:45.765 --> 22:49.136
Don't bring the afro.
Wait, wait a minute.

22:49.170 --> 22:50.871
- What?
- Why last night,

22:50.905 --> 22:52.273
me and Dante, we was
getting it in, right?

22:52.306 --> 22:53.807
- Uh-huh.
- And when we were done,

22:53.841 --> 22:55.943
he asked what I thought
about marriage.

22:55.976 --> 22:57.945
- Oh, my God.
- I think he's about to ask.

22:57.978 --> 23:00.347
You'd better say yes
and not run him off.

23:00.381 --> 23:02.082
I'm going to say it. I'm not.
I don't run people off.

23:02.116 --> 23:03.817
You'd better not mess this up.

23:03.851 --> 23:07.720
Shut up.
I love him.

23:07.754 --> 23:09.490
Okay, something's wrong with you

23:09.523 --> 23:11.192
'cause you've been sitting here
moping and stuff.

23:11.225 --> 23:12.493
I'm sorry. I'm... I'm sorry.

23:12.526 --> 23:13.793
I'm sorry, you guys. I'm sorry.

23:13.827 --> 23:15.930
I'm... I'm just thinking.

23:15.963 --> 23:19.466
Well, stop thinking.
You're messing up the vibe.

23:19.500 --> 23:21.835
Okay, seriously. I want
to ask you guys something.

23:21.869 --> 23:25.306
- Oh, Lord. What?
- Okay.

23:25.339 --> 23:26.974
Do you think that Brian
would cheat on me?

23:27.007 --> 23:30.377
- What?
- Girl, Brian all weird-ass. No.

23:30.411 --> 23:32.179
No, I don't think so.

23:32.213 --> 23:34.448
- What would make you ask that?
- I don't know.

23:34.481 --> 23:38.118
He's just... He's just out of
town on business a lot.

23:38.152 --> 23:40.120
- It's called work, Nicole.
- No.

23:40.154 --> 23:41.922
No, every year
on our anniversary

23:41.956 --> 23:43.891
he always acts a little strange.

23:43.924 --> 23:48.362
But I don't know,
this year something's different.

23:48.395 --> 23:50.064
- Mm.
- Mm.

23:50.097 --> 23:53.000
Did you check his phone?
Look at his e-mails, nothing?

23:53.033 --> 23:56.170
- Did you check his car?
- His car?

23:56.203 --> 23:58.005
Because you never
drive his car.

23:58.038 --> 23:59.772
You always drive your car
when y'all go out,

23:59.807 --> 24:01.842
so maybe he won't think
you'd search in there.

24:01.875 --> 24:04.378
Mm-mm.
Knowing, mm, come on.

24:04.411 --> 24:05.546
Something is in his car.
Let's check.

24:05.579 --> 24:07.881
What?

24:07.915 --> 24:09.883
Locked.

24:09.917 --> 24:11.952
You don't have a spare key?

24:11.986 --> 24:13.520
No, he usually
takes it with him.

24:13.554 --> 24:14.955
Oh.

24:14.989 --> 24:17.558
Well, Brian is your husband,
right?

24:17.591 --> 24:20.261
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Call roadside assistance.

24:20.294 --> 24:24.164
They going to let you in
through the satellite.

24:24.198 --> 24:25.532
- You're shady.
- Mm-hmm.

24:25.566 --> 24:27.034
Alright.

24:27.067 --> 24:28.936
Can't believe I'm doing this.

24:35.175 --> 24:37.911
Roadside Assistance.
How may I help you?

24:37.945 --> 24:43.017
Hi, yes, we are locked
out of our car.

24:43.050 --> 24:45.052
Sure. Can I have
your name, please?

24:45.085 --> 24:47.921
Yes, Brian and Nicole Taylor.

24:47.955 --> 24:50.424
And can I have
the access code?

24:50.457 --> 24:54.161
The code? It's 1212.

24:54.194 --> 24:55.996
Stand by.

24:56.030 --> 24:57.598
Boom.

24:57.631 --> 24:59.400
Exactly. Exactly.

24:59.433 --> 25:01.535
Yeah, it just worked.
Thank you very much.

25:01.568 --> 25:03.137
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

25:03.170 --> 25:04.371
Thank me later.

25:04.405 --> 25:06.307
Okay, clearly you've
done that before.

25:06.340 --> 25:09.543
Well, girl, growing up in the
hood, you learn a thing or two.

25:12.946 --> 25:16.083
Okay. Alright. Let's see.

25:16.116 --> 25:17.851
Everything.

25:26.393 --> 25:28.262
Call Paige?

25:28.295 --> 25:29.630
Mm.

25:29.663 --> 25:32.366
Paige.
That's a white girl name, too.

25:32.399 --> 25:33.967
Well, they get on my nerve.

25:34.001 --> 25:37.037
Tammy. Stop.
You are jumping to conclusions.

25:37.071 --> 25:39.440
This doesn't... We don't even
know if this means anything.

25:39.473 --> 25:42.910
- It's just a note.
- Girl. Try your name.

25:42.943 --> 25:44.011
Okay.

25:47.047 --> 25:51.919
Oh, okay.

25:51.952 --> 25:53.354
- What is it? What?
- Bow.

25:53.387 --> 25:55.155
Our names plus
the date of our marriage.

25:55.189 --> 25:57.991
Oh.

25:58.025 --> 26:01.462
Okay. Paige.

26:01.495 --> 26:03.430
No results found.

26:03.464 --> 26:05.999
Okay. Okay, this is good.

26:06.033 --> 26:07.935
This is good.
You should feel good.

26:07.968 --> 26:09.536
Right? You should feel good.
She should feel good.

26:09.570 --> 26:11.205
- Yeah.
- You know what?

26:11.238 --> 26:13.574
I'm sorry, you guys.
I'm being totally paranoid.

26:13.607 --> 26:15.442
- You're right.
- That's okay.

26:15.476 --> 26:18.312
Look, that's what we here for,
to be paranoid with you.

26:18.345 --> 26:21.348
Oh, and I wouldn't tell Brian
anything, not in the least

26:21.382 --> 26:23.550
until you have solid evidence
to prove your case.

26:23.584 --> 26:25.018
- Alright?
- Let's go get us a drink,

26:25.052 --> 26:27.121
'cause you need one
and I need one.

26:27.154 --> 26:28.689
We just all in the man's office.

26:28.722 --> 26:30.424
Girl.

26:30.457 --> 26:32.993
- Got my blood pressure all up.
- Man, he just at work.

26:44.605 --> 26:47.574
Oh, well, if it isn't
my son's beautiful wife.

26:47.608 --> 26:50.577
Come on.
Let me fix you some tea.

26:50.611 --> 26:54.281
So, how are you
and my baby doing?

26:54.314 --> 26:58.485
Honestly,
been a little bit concerned

26:58.519 --> 27:02.289
about all these business trips
he's been leaving on.

27:04.491 --> 27:08.195
My Brian is a busy man,
you know that.

27:08.228 --> 27:10.497
That's what you
signed up for.

27:10.531 --> 27:13.100
And you yourself
as a big-shot attorney,

27:13.133 --> 27:15.035
you're busy too.

27:15.068 --> 27:18.105
Yes, I know. It's just...

27:18.138 --> 27:20.073
I guess I've been wondering

27:20.107 --> 27:25.979
if Brian would ever do anything
to hurt the relationship.

27:26.013 --> 27:28.482
Like?

27:28.515 --> 27:30.484
Have an affair?

27:30.517 --> 27:34.621
No, I highly doubt
that he would be cheating.

27:34.655 --> 27:37.591
An affair, no.

27:37.624 --> 27:40.694
I want to believe that,
Mrs. Taylor.

27:40.727 --> 27:44.097
It's just that, right now,
I mean,

27:44.131 --> 27:48.302
sometimes he's present,
sometimes he's not.

27:48.335 --> 27:52.673
I just... I just don't know
what to do.

27:57.678 --> 28:00.247
A hippo?

28:00.280 --> 28:04.117
Extremely unpredictable.

28:04.151 --> 28:08.789
Making him the most
dangerous mammal in Africa.

28:08.823 --> 28:11.758
- I did not know that.
- Hmm.

28:11.792 --> 28:17.698
Men can be dangerously
unpredictable, but not my Brian.

28:17.731 --> 28:20.133
You'd think after
four years of marriage,

28:20.167 --> 28:23.437
I'd be able to
predict him by now.

28:23.470 --> 28:28.141
Well, why don't you
try talking to him?

28:28.175 --> 28:30.611
You'd be amazed
at how communication

28:30.644 --> 28:32.479
works in a marriage.

28:32.513 --> 28:35.082
I would have have
never been able to be

28:35.115 --> 28:40.989
with my Patrick for 30 years
without communication.

28:43.190 --> 28:47.661
God rest his soul.

28:47.694 --> 28:51.298
Thank you.
I needed to hear that.

28:51.331 --> 28:52.533
Come on, dear.

28:52.566 --> 28:55.102
I'm going to get you
some barbecue.

28:55.135 --> 28:58.806
I'm so glad you came early
so we'd have a chance to chat

28:58.840 --> 29:02.609
and talk before
my loud friends got here.

29:02.643 --> 29:05.078
If you want some flip-flops,
I got some for you.

29:05.112 --> 29:06.146
Thank you.

29:11.218 --> 29:15.656
Alright, babe.
Got to run, got to run.

29:15.689 --> 29:16.858
- Love you.
- Love you too.

29:16.891 --> 29:19.359
Alright.

29:41.214 --> 29:42.716
Let's go. One, two.

29:42.749 --> 29:44.418
One, two. Good.

29:44.451 --> 29:45.419
Nice. Again.

29:45.452 --> 29:47.354
Good. One, two, one, two.

29:47.387 --> 29:48.689
Good. High kick.

29:48.722 --> 29:50.524
Again, again.

29:52.159 --> 29:53.460
Guilty!

30:26.627 --> 30:28.161
- Okay.
- Thank you.

30:28.195 --> 30:29.529
- You're welcome.
- Love you, babe.

30:29.563 --> 30:31.798
- Love you too. Bye.
- See you soon.

30:55.689 --> 31:00.260
Hi, yes, I'm just trying to
access some of my phone records,

31:00.293 --> 31:02.596
and I seem to have
forgotten my password.

31:38.866 --> 31:40.634
Cute. Okay, let's put
that one on the left side.

31:40.667 --> 31:42.870
Let's put that over there
in the front.

31:42.904 --> 31:46.339
- Brandi, hey.
- Nicole Taylor.

31:46.373 --> 31:48.542
What a pleasant surprise.

31:48.575 --> 31:50.878
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, I was in the area,

31:50.912 --> 31:53.380
thought I'd come and check
out the boutique.

31:53.413 --> 31:55.649
- Let me show you around.
- Sure.

32:10.064 --> 32:12.799
So what made you want
to open a boutique here

32:12.834 --> 32:14.401
instead of overseas?

32:14.434 --> 32:15.870
I mean, I know
you were modeling over there.

32:15.903 --> 32:18.806
I was keeping up
with you, girl.

32:18.840 --> 32:26.013
Honestly, I got so wrapped up
in that life that I almost died.

32:26.047 --> 32:29.549
Partying too much, not eating,
trying to stay skinny.

32:29.583 --> 32:33.921
It just was a lot on me.

32:33.955 --> 32:36.490
So I moved back.

32:36.523 --> 32:40.527
I wanted to feel something
familiar again, you know?

32:40.560 --> 32:42.596
Been sober for five years now.

32:42.629 --> 32:44.464
- Really?
- Yeah.

32:44.498 --> 32:46.533
- Well, good for you.
- Thanks.

32:46.566 --> 32:48.002
But enough about me.
What about you?

32:48.035 --> 32:50.437
- How's Brian?
- Amazing.

32:50.470 --> 32:52.807
Coming up on our
four-year anniversary,

32:52.840 --> 32:54.641
even though it seems
like only yesterday

32:54.674 --> 32:56.676
he swept me off my feet, so...

32:56.710 --> 32:59.546
I'm so happy for you, Nicole.

32:59.579 --> 33:01.949
I know how much
you've always wanted that,

33:01.983 --> 33:05.352
ever since we were kids.

33:05.385 --> 33:06.686
Yeah, thanks.

33:08.990 --> 33:11.558
You know,
I never got to say sorry

33:11.591 --> 33:14.728
for what happened
at summer camp.

33:14.761 --> 33:19.033
Oh, I mean, come on, Brandi.
We were young and stupid.

33:19.066 --> 33:21.903
You guys may have been.
I wasn't.

33:24.704 --> 33:27.875
- That was in the past.
- I know.

33:27.909 --> 33:31.112
But it affected all of us
that summer.

33:31.145 --> 33:33.480
Camp is boring.
Camp sucks.

33:33.513 --> 33:35.615
No, it doesn't.

33:35.649 --> 33:37.717
- What's up, Devon?
- What's up, bro?

33:37.751 --> 33:39.452
Hello, Nicole.

33:39.486 --> 33:42.123
Hi.

33:42.156 --> 33:44.658
Oh, what's up, Piggy Pete?

33:44.691 --> 33:46.693
Oh, come on, Devon, do you need
to keep making fun of me?

33:46.726 --> 33:49.663
Do you have to bother him?
He's not bothering you.

33:49.696 --> 33:52.365
Nah, just him being here's
bothering me.

33:52.399 --> 33:54.936
Forget you.

33:54.969 --> 33:57.071
Come on, guys, leave him alone!

33:57.104 --> 34:00.007
- You don't have to do that!
- Nicole, stop.

34:00.041 --> 34:02.944
Stop being such a Debbie Downer.
They're only kidding.

34:07.982 --> 34:10.583
Going to go cry
to your mom now, Piggy Peter?

34:10.617 --> 34:13.020
Yeah, Piggy Pete,
go cry to your mom.

34:13.054 --> 34:15.156
Come on, guys. Let's go.

34:15.188 --> 34:17.389
- Let's go, Nicole.
- See you later, pig.

34:20.928 --> 34:24.464
I never meant
for any of that to happen.

34:24.496 --> 34:25.867
Part of me was just being a kid

34:25.900 --> 34:29.837
but the other part knew
I was taking it too far.

34:29.871 --> 34:31.973
Peter was a good kid.

34:32.005 --> 34:34.641
He didn't deserve that.

34:34.674 --> 34:37.812
I mean, we killed him, Nicole.

34:37.844 --> 34:40.547
Look, we've all done things
that we're not proud of,

34:40.580 --> 34:43.117
that we wish we could take back.

34:43.150 --> 34:46.053
But what's done is done.

34:46.087 --> 34:49.924
The important thing now
is what we do as adults.

34:49.956 --> 34:52.025
You're right.

34:52.059 --> 34:55.527
You know what? I should go.

34:55.562 --> 34:58.598
Hey, it was really nice
seeing you, Nicole.

34:58.632 --> 35:00.935
You too, Brandi.

35:00.968 --> 35:06.539
Hey, let's not let any time pass
before we do this again, okay?

35:06.573 --> 35:09.676
Life is too short.

35:09.709 --> 35:10.912
Couldn't agree more.

35:50.717 --> 35:52.485
Looks like she OD'd on heroin.

35:52.519 --> 35:54.721
- Really?
- Girl said she left at 8:45,

35:54.754 --> 35:57.624
came back a few minutes later,
and found her dead.

35:57.657 --> 35:59.193
Shit.

36:08.235 --> 36:11.638
Hi. I'm Detective Tucker.
What's your name?

36:11.671 --> 36:13.040
Jessica.

36:13.074 --> 36:14.809
It's nice to meet you, Jessica.

36:14.842 --> 36:18.813
So... So I understand you left
around 8:00 or so?

36:18.846 --> 36:20.881
I left at 8:45.

36:20.915 --> 36:24.251
Came back 5 or 10 minutes
later to grab my phone.

36:24.285 --> 36:25.987
That's when I found her.

36:26.020 --> 36:27.888
Did you ever see
Miss Smith using drugs?

36:27.922 --> 36:29.556
No, sir.

36:29.589 --> 36:31.158
Did you ever see her
looking distracted,

36:31.192 --> 36:33.227
strange behavior at the job,
or anything to make you feel

36:33.260 --> 36:35.695
like maybe she had
a drug problem?

36:35.729 --> 36:37.064
Never.

36:37.098 --> 36:39.900
If anything, she was
completely against drugs.

36:39.934 --> 36:43.871
This is shocking, honestly.

36:43.904 --> 36:45.873
Alright.

36:45.906 --> 36:47.507
Thank you, Jessica.

36:56.851 --> 36:58.785
This is
a very, very serious matter,

36:58.819 --> 37:00.620
as I'm sure you know.

37:00.653 --> 37:02.189
I talked to a young lady
that worked with her,

37:02.223 --> 37:04.657
and she said that you were
the last one to talk to her

37:04.691 --> 37:06.193
or see her before she died.

37:06.227 --> 37:08.162
Yes, I-I did stop by her store.

37:08.195 --> 37:10.931
- So you knew Brandi?
- Yes, we grew up together.

37:10.965 --> 37:13.067
And you knew
Miranda Smith too, right?

37:13.100 --> 37:16.669
Miranda, Brandi,
our other friend Sommer.

37:16.703 --> 37:19.340
- We were inseparable as kids.
- How close were you?

37:19.373 --> 37:21.142
Okay, why is any of this
necessary, Detective?

37:21.175 --> 37:23.344
- I'm just doing my job.
- Babe, it's okay.

37:23.377 --> 37:25.946
- Babe.
- It's okay.

37:25.980 --> 37:29.950
How close were you all?

37:29.984 --> 37:33.821
Well, we went to elementary
school together, summer camp.

37:33.854 --> 37:36.057
We were close as kids,
but honestly

37:36.090 --> 37:39.226
we hadn't really seen each other
for a few years until recently.

37:39.260 --> 37:40.794
Got it.

37:40.828 --> 37:42.163
So she never mentioned to you

37:42.196 --> 37:43.864
anything that would
make you feel like

37:43.898 --> 37:45.066
she was going to relapse?

37:45.099 --> 37:47.734
No. Nothing at all.

37:47.767 --> 37:49.236
She seemed very in control
of her life.

37:49.270 --> 37:52.073
She told me she'd been clean
for five years.

37:52.106 --> 37:54.075
Never alluded to
anything made you feel like

37:54.108 --> 37:57.610
- she was crying out for help?
- No.

37:57.644 --> 38:01.714
Honestly, this whole thing comes
as a complete shock to me.

38:01.748 --> 38:04.385
Well, thank you.
Mr. and Mrs. Taylor, thank you.

38:04.418 --> 38:07.888
And I'm genuinely sorry
for your loss.

38:07.922 --> 38:09.656
I will show you out.

38:22.103 --> 38:24.038
Say you wanted
to commit suicide, right,

38:24.071 --> 38:25.840
so you jumped off the roof.

38:25.873 --> 38:29.110
Do you think you would have
enough time to change your mind,

38:29.143 --> 38:31.979
turn around, and grab something?

38:32.012 --> 38:34.348
Mm, probably not. Why?

38:34.381 --> 38:39.386
Because this autopsy report
says that she had bruising

38:39.420 --> 38:41.355
and scratching inside her hand

38:41.388 --> 38:43.390
as if she was trying
to grab something.

38:43.424 --> 38:46.026
Hmm. So what does that mean?

38:46.060 --> 38:48.395
That means that she was
hanging onto something

38:48.429 --> 38:50.064
before she fell.

38:50.097 --> 38:53.300
Mm. Maybe it was an accident.
Maybe she slipped.

38:53.334 --> 38:56.103
Or maybe she was pushed.
Maybe she was helped.

38:56.137 --> 38:58.339
And the Brandi girl,
find anything on her?

38:58.372 --> 39:01.809
Her report. I checked it out.
She was a model.

39:01.842 --> 39:05.246
She got arrested a few times...
DUI, possession.

39:05.279 --> 39:07.314
But part of her probation
was that she had to be admitted

39:07.348 --> 39:09.884
to a drug treatment program
five years ago.

39:09.917 --> 39:11.784
But get this.

39:11.819 --> 39:15.156
She was addicted
to cocaine and alcohol.

39:15.189 --> 39:17.458
She had never done heroin.

39:17.491 --> 39:20.793
Five years later, she ODs?

39:20.828 --> 39:23.230
I don't know, Detective.
Maybe it's beginner's luck.

39:23.264 --> 39:26.200
You're not funny, man.
This is serious.

39:26.233 --> 39:29.970
Alright. Talk to me.

39:30.004 --> 39:32.473
Both of the girls went to school
together, they grew up together.

39:32.506 --> 39:35.409
Two girls go to school together,
they both commit suicide.

39:35.442 --> 39:38.145
I know, it's a strange
circumstance. It happens.

39:38.179 --> 39:41.714
I'm not buying that. I'm not.

39:41.748 --> 39:43.750
My gut tells me
something ain't right.

39:43.783 --> 39:45.953
Detective Patterson,
we need you.

39:45.986 --> 39:47.720
Yeah? Alright, one second.

39:52.393 --> 39:55.129
You might be onto
something here, Detective.

39:55.162 --> 39:56.497
Let me know.

39:56.530 --> 39:58.432
Alright, what's up?

39:58.465 --> 40:00.267
We got a multiple
homicide situation.

40:11.845 --> 40:14.747
I'm sorry to call you
down here on such short notice.

40:14.781 --> 40:17.151
Note that this is being
recorded for the record.

40:20.321 --> 40:23.090
Tell me again about
your conversation with Miranda

40:23.123 --> 40:24.325
before she died.

40:24.358 --> 40:27.094
She told me about
her new boyfriend.

40:27.127 --> 40:30.464
We talked about our lives.
I mean, not much.

40:30.497 --> 40:32.166
She didn't seem suicidal?

40:32.199 --> 40:34.801
No, no. Not at all.

40:34.835 --> 40:37.538
Quite the opposite, actually.
She seemed really happy.

40:37.571 --> 40:41.542
Both were your friends.
That's... That's devastating.

40:41.575 --> 40:45.412
I want to know w-what's
your thoughts on that?

40:45.446 --> 40:49.016
All I know is Miranda
was a great friend.

40:49.049 --> 40:51.252
She didn't deserve it.

40:51.285 --> 40:53.854
Brandi on the other hand, she...

40:53.887 --> 40:54.955
Oh, you had a problem
with Brandi?

40:54.989 --> 40:56.190
That's not what I said.

40:56.223 --> 40:57.558
Why would you say
"on the other hand"?

40:57.591 --> 40:59.460
One deserves it,
it seems like you're implying

40:59.493 --> 41:00.995
someone deserved to die.

41:01.028 --> 41:03.330
What I meant was that she wasn't

41:03.364 --> 41:07.134
the nicest person in the world
growing up, that is all.

41:07.167 --> 41:09.103
Where you from?
You from the hood?

41:09.136 --> 41:12.573
I was raised in Maryland, went
to college in South Carolina.

41:12.606 --> 41:14.074
Not so sure about
the other girls

41:14.108 --> 41:16.176
other than they were
my wife's friends.

41:16.210 --> 41:19.179
What was your relationship
like with Brandi?

41:19.213 --> 41:21.949
I've known her since childhood.

41:21.982 --> 41:25.452
Knew her since childhood.

41:25.486 --> 41:27.855
And then we lost contact
after high school.

41:27.888 --> 41:30.057
She got a modeling contract
and then left the country,

41:30.090 --> 41:32.359
I mean, I hadn't
seen her in years.

41:32.393 --> 41:35.929
Until you saw her
at... at the funeral.

41:35.963 --> 41:37.498
Correct.

41:37.531 --> 41:40.134
So where were you the night
that Miranda got murdered?

41:40.167 --> 41:42.903
I'm sorry, excuse me.

41:42.936 --> 41:45.339
Allegedly committed suicide?

41:45.372 --> 41:47.341
At home.

41:47.374 --> 41:49.209
Nicole called me
when she first heard it.

41:49.243 --> 41:51.478
She called you first.

41:51.512 --> 41:53.480
Yes. She called me first.

41:53.514 --> 41:57.017
You don't know anybody who would
want either of these women dead?

41:57.051 --> 41:58.385
No.

41:58.419 --> 42:00.254
Thank you, Mrs. Taylor.

42:00.287 --> 42:02.222
You're free to go.

42:02.256 --> 42:04.291
Not guilty.

42:30.384 --> 42:32.553
Nicole, have a seat.

42:34.588 --> 42:39.493
Look, the partners and I
feel it's best that

42:39.526 --> 42:42.429
while you're going through
this rough patch,

42:42.463 --> 42:44.365
you take some time off.

42:44.398 --> 42:47.468
Wait, Roger, are you firing me?

42:47.501 --> 42:50.137
Of course not.
You're my best attorney.

42:50.170 --> 42:53.173
Just lately you're not
mentally here.

42:53.207 --> 42:54.975
I mean, you... you missed
a couple of staff meetings.

42:55.008 --> 42:56.543
You've been late a few times.
It's not you.

42:56.577 --> 43:00.581
Yeah, look, I-I have been
dealing with a lot.

43:00.614 --> 43:04.251
- But I can fix it, I promise.
- Nicole.

43:04.284 --> 43:06.320
You lost your first case
in years today.

43:06.353 --> 43:08.922
Your head's not in the game, and
I cannot afford any mistakes.

43:08.956 --> 43:11.992
Roger, I started here
as a temp 10 years ago.

43:12.025 --> 43:13.060
I've given this company
everything.

43:13.093 --> 43:14.461
This... This place is my life.

43:14.495 --> 43:16.430
That's why we're
giving you a paid leave.

43:16.463 --> 43:18.432
Think of it as the vacation
you've been wanting to take.

43:18.465 --> 43:20.000
Roger, please.

43:20.033 --> 43:21.702
Till this whole thing
blows over, okay?

43:21.735 --> 43:23.437
Great.

43:30.344 --> 43:31.712
Been meaning
to clean out this closet

43:31.745 --> 43:33.147
ever since Brian and I moved in.

43:33.180 --> 43:37.217
I've just been
so busy with work,

43:37.251 --> 43:40.187
- haven't had the time, you know?
- I've seen.

43:40.220 --> 43:42.055
Well, now you have
all the time in the world.

43:42.089 --> 43:44.658
It's not like you got to go back
to work today or tomorrow.

43:46.193 --> 43:48.529
Yeah.

43:52.099 --> 43:53.534
What's wrong, Nicole?

43:56.170 --> 43:58.539
I don't know.

44:00.240 --> 44:02.609
I don't know.

44:02.643 --> 44:09.316
You know, I just can't look
at Brian in the same way.

44:09.349 --> 44:12.352
I don't want to believe
that he's cheating on me.

44:12.386 --> 44:14.221
Brian is a loner.

44:14.254 --> 44:17.257
I mean, technically,
you are all that he has.

44:17.291 --> 44:19.092
Look, if you really feel
like the man is cheating on you,

44:19.126 --> 44:20.360
we can call my cousin Jerell,

44:20.394 --> 44:22.296
he can come over here,
beat his ass,

44:22.329 --> 44:25.466
and we can just
get it handled, okay?

44:25.499 --> 44:29.369
- You are a hot mess.
- I know, and I got your back.

44:29.403 --> 44:32.606
- Oh, my God.
- What? Ahh.

44:32.639 --> 44:35.642
There is some serious
blackmail material in here.

44:35.676 --> 44:38.278
Mm-hmm.

44:38.312 --> 44:41.081
- Let's see.
- Let's see, let's see.

44:44.384 --> 44:47.488
Ha! Look at your hair.

44:47.521 --> 44:51.425
Unh-unh. Why did your mom
do you like that?

44:51.458 --> 44:53.427
Look, you know yours
is just as bad.

44:53.460 --> 44:55.429
Oh, no, I burned
my yearbook picture.

44:55.462 --> 44:57.564
Middle school was
the worst years of my life.

44:57.598 --> 44:59.066
Ah, yeah, tell me about it,

44:59.099 --> 45:00.434
I couldn't wait to get
to high school.

45:00.467 --> 45:02.402
Okay, yeah, high school,
I was cute.

45:04.839 --> 45:10.143
Look at Miranda.
She was so cute.

45:10.177 --> 45:13.413
- I'm sorry, Nicole.
- Yeah.

45:15.616 --> 45:18.552
Well, and Brandi,
she looks the same.

45:18.585 --> 45:22.155
She's been beautiful
her whole life, damn.

45:22.189 --> 45:26.793
Oh, I see why y'all
looked up to her.

45:26.828 --> 45:28.495
Oh, wow.

45:28.529 --> 45:30.297
Piggy Pete.

45:30.330 --> 45:32.666
- Hmm.
- Peter Wells.

45:32.699 --> 45:34.836
Now, that boy
was in love with me.

45:34.869 --> 45:36.637
Oh, I remember you
telling me about him,

45:36.670 --> 45:40.173
the little fat boy that was
crazy about you at the camp.

45:40.207 --> 45:41.742
Yeah.

45:41.775 --> 45:44.478
Gosh, we were
awful to him as kids.

45:47.681 --> 45:50.617
Put him down, he can't swim!
He can't swim!

45:50.651 --> 45:53.587
- Put him in the water!
- He can't swim!

45:53.620 --> 45:55.489
- Nicole!
- He can't swim!

45:55.522 --> 45:57.224
He can't swim!

45:57.257 --> 45:59.793
Stop!

46:05.332 --> 46:07.267
What y'all in here
talking about?

46:07.301 --> 46:10.671
- What's up, Brian?
- What's up?

46:10.704 --> 46:13.373
We were just looking at my
old middle school yearbook.

46:13.407 --> 46:16.878
Oh, no.
Oh, my goodness, let me see.

46:16.911 --> 46:19.346
Let me see this.

46:19.379 --> 46:23.116
Ohh, babe, you were so cute.
Look at that.

46:23.150 --> 46:25.652
And even more beautiful now.

46:25.686 --> 46:28.288
Whoa, wait, is that little fat
boy you said had a crush on you?

46:28.322 --> 46:31.458
Ah, yeah.
We were terrible to him.

46:31.491 --> 46:34.761
Called him Piggy Peter
because he was overweight.

46:34.795 --> 46:37.865
Young girls are so harsh.

46:37.899 --> 46:40.734
Well, he had his chance
and now you all mine.

46:40.767 --> 46:42.369
I'm off to work.

46:42.402 --> 46:45.505
You ladies be good, alright?

46:45.539 --> 46:47.174
Bye, babe.

46:47.207 --> 46:48.775
Hey.

46:48.810 --> 46:50.912
You be sure and take care of her
while I'm gone, alright?

46:50.945 --> 46:52.412
- I got you.
- Okay.

46:52.446 --> 46:53.647
- Okay.
- Okay.

46:53.680 --> 46:55.850
Okay.

46:55.883 --> 46:59.186
- Do you think he heard us?
- I hope not.

47:04.625 --> 47:06.593
Okay, look, I've been
doing some research,

47:06.627 --> 47:08.261
and I found out
where the girl works.

47:08.295 --> 47:10.530
- Stop.
- That old bar.

47:10.564 --> 47:12.399
Girl, we need to go
up there and regulate.

47:12.432 --> 47:16.503
- I got my bat in the car.
- Relax. Stop being dramatic.

47:16.536 --> 47:18.538
I was thinking more like
we call.

47:18.572 --> 47:20.808
You know, I just want to
find out what's going on.

47:20.842 --> 47:23.377
- I don't want to cause a scene.
- Call.

47:23.410 --> 47:24.578
Okay.

47:30.617 --> 47:33.553
Federal Bar and Grill.
May I help you?

47:33.587 --> 47:36.690
- Hi, can I speak to Paige?
- Who's calling?

47:36.723 --> 47:39.426
Tell her it's an old friend.

47:39.459 --> 47:42.229
- Paige.
- Yeah?

47:45.365 --> 47:46.500
Who is it?

47:46.533 --> 47:50.303
She said it's an old friend.

47:50.337 --> 47:51.705
Hello. This is Paige.

47:51.738 --> 47:53.573
Hey, Paige, you need
to watch your back, ho.

47:53.607 --> 47:55.509
What are you doing?

48:04.018 --> 48:05.585
Girl, look,
if you want to do this,

48:05.619 --> 48:07.421
you need to do it the right way,
okay?

48:07.454 --> 48:10.290
Go up there
and bust this nigga out.

48:10.323 --> 48:11.826
Put on your sneakers.

48:21.501 --> 48:23.303
Alright, Jared,
I'll see you tomorrow.

48:23.336 --> 48:24.738
Alright, have a good one.

51:15.209 --> 51:18.745
Hey, babe, you coming to bed?

51:27.221 --> 51:28.956
Nicole?

51:48.508 --> 51:51.678
Ah, yeah. This is...

51:51.711 --> 51:53.114
- It's not what it looks like.
- It's not what it looks like?

51:53.147 --> 51:55.682
No, it's not
what it looks like, baby.

51:55.715 --> 51:57.784
My friends are dying,

51:57.818 --> 52:01.721
and you leave me here alone
while you're running around town

52:01.755 --> 52:03.190
cheating on me
with some other woman?

52:03.224 --> 52:05.525
I am not cheating with you
with some other woman.

52:05.558 --> 52:08.628
I saw her leaving
your mother's house, Brian.

52:08.662 --> 52:10.965
- I can explain that.
- You can explain that?

52:10.998 --> 52:12.900
Well, can you explain why I saw
the two of your arguing

52:12.934 --> 52:15.069
in some random apartment garage?

52:15.102 --> 52:17.704
You've been lying to me,

52:17.737 --> 52:20.074
telling me you're going out
of town on business trips

52:20.107 --> 52:21.574
when really
you've been seeing her.

52:21.608 --> 52:23.177
Will you just stop it, okay?

52:23.210 --> 52:25.146
Now, I know what this looks
like, but this is not that.

52:25.179 --> 52:26.713
- Really?
- Really, it's not.

52:26.746 --> 52:27.982
- Really?
- Yeah.

52:28.015 --> 52:31.919
Okay. So who is she?

52:31.953 --> 52:34.754
Who is she?

52:34.788 --> 52:39.160
Okay, first of all,
I'm not cheating on you.

52:39.193 --> 52:43.130
Okay?
Now, yes, I do know this woman.

52:43.164 --> 52:46.666
But it's not what you think.
We work together.

52:56.077 --> 52:59.646
You're lying. You are lying.

52:59.679 --> 53:01.215
Babe, okay, listen.

53:01.248 --> 53:02.582
You got to trust me,
I would not...

53:02.615 --> 53:04.185
You want me to trust you?

53:04.218 --> 53:07.587
When you've never even mentioned
this random beautiful women

53:07.620 --> 53:09.824
who you work with,
who knows your mother?

53:09.857 --> 53:11.624
Because I knew
how you would react.

53:11.658 --> 53:13.294
I can't even look
at you right now.

53:13.327 --> 53:15.729
Okay, alright.
You want the truth?

53:15.762 --> 53:19.900
- Yeah, I want the truth.
- Okay, truth time.

53:19.934 --> 53:21.534
She told me she was
going to hurt you

53:21.568 --> 53:23.770
if I didn't sleep with her.

53:23.804 --> 53:25.705
Oh, so you did sleep with her.

53:25.739 --> 53:27.640
- No, I did not sleep... I...
- Yes, you did!

53:27.674 --> 53:29.709
No, I didn't.

53:42.823 --> 53:44.025
You slept with her.

53:44.058 --> 53:46.093
No, I didn't, babe.

53:46.127 --> 53:50.663
I'm going to say this
one last time.

53:50.697 --> 53:52.199
I did not touch that woman.

53:52.233 --> 53:54.768
You must think I'm an idiot.

53:54.801 --> 53:56.303
Now, you either believe me
or you don't.

53:56.337 --> 53:57.872
- Well, I don't.
- Okay.

53:57.905 --> 54:00.207
Well, she's crazy, Nicole. Yeah.

54:00.241 --> 54:02.109
And she's capable of a lot.
I was trying to protect you.

54:02.143 --> 54:03.676
You were trying to protect me?

54:03.710 --> 54:05.779
- Then you should have been here!
- Okay.

54:05.813 --> 54:06.814
You know what? Just... Just go.

54:06.847 --> 54:09.083
Just go. Just leave.

54:09.116 --> 54:11.886
- Babe, listen to me.
- Get off of me.

54:11.919 --> 54:14.255
Get out of here now.

54:14.288 --> 54:16.824
Okay. Alright.

54:20.327 --> 54:23.696
- Nicole, would I...
- Get out of here!

54:53.427 --> 54:56.796
So I followed her,

54:56.831 --> 54:59.766
and sure enough,
she was there to meet Brian.

55:02.169 --> 55:04.405
So what happened?

55:04.438 --> 55:07.274
I watched them from my car.

55:07.308 --> 55:09.609
They were arguing.
I don't know about what.

55:11.412 --> 55:14.148
I got really upset so I left.

55:14.181 --> 55:18.252
And then Brian came home from
his "out of town" business trip,

55:18.285 --> 55:22.957
and we had this huge argument,
and I had to kick him out.

55:22.990 --> 55:27.027
- You kick... You kicked him out?
- Yep.

55:27.061 --> 55:29.163
Oh, my God.

55:29.196 --> 55:30.898
Did you tell Tammy?

55:30.931 --> 55:33.200
Tammy? No.

55:33.234 --> 55:38.005
- Brian would be dead.
- Yeah.

55:38.038 --> 55:39.672
I'm really sorry.

55:41.475 --> 55:45.846
Okay, you know what?
Let's drink some wine.

55:45.880 --> 55:47.714
Everything's going to be fine.

55:47.747 --> 55:49.283
Here you go.

55:57.024 --> 55:58.791
I love you.

55:58.826 --> 56:00.060
I love you too.
Thanks for coming.

56:00.094 --> 56:02.263
No problem.

56:02.296 --> 56:04.465
That's my girl.
Come on. This is good.

56:04.498 --> 56:06.133
You're going to love it.

56:16.977 --> 56:18.345
I hope you know
I'm spending the night.

56:18.379 --> 56:20.214
Yes, please, of course.

56:20.247 --> 56:23.150
I'm not letting you drive
after all this wine.

56:23.184 --> 56:25.252
- Right?
- It'll be just like

56:25.286 --> 56:26.921
when we had our sleepovers
when we were kids.

56:26.954 --> 56:29.023
Remember when we used to, like,

56:29.056 --> 56:31.392
try and pick which boys
were going to be our husbands?

56:31.425 --> 56:34.228
You remember
I was in love with Usher?

56:34.261 --> 56:36.130
He was my husband.

56:36.163 --> 56:37.464
- Yes, he was.
- Mrs. Usher.

56:37.498 --> 56:39.867
I think you were
obsessed with him, actually.

56:39.900 --> 56:43.204
Do you remember when my mom
took me to a concert

56:43.237 --> 56:46.507
when I was 16, and I fainted
after the first song?

56:46.540 --> 56:48.741
- Yep. I do.
- Oh, my God.

56:48.775 --> 56:51.212
Okay, okay, but do you remember

56:51.245 --> 56:53.847
when I was married
to Batman from Immature?

56:53.881 --> 56:56.383
- Oh, my God.
- We had a wedding and everything

56:56.417 --> 56:59.153
and then I found out he was
Roger from "Sister, Sister,"

56:59.186 --> 57:02.156
and then we got a divorce.

57:02.189 --> 57:05.526
But I did... I did have
that pillow with his face

57:05.559 --> 57:08.095
spray-painted on it
that I used to cuddle.

57:08.128 --> 57:10.097
- You wouldn't let anyone else...
- No.

57:10.130 --> 57:12.799
...sleep on it.

57:12.833 --> 57:15.903
- Oh, my God, those days.
- We were crazy back then.

57:15.936 --> 57:18.038
Yeah.

57:18.072 --> 57:23.844
But we always had
each other's backs though.

57:23.877 --> 57:26.880
No matter what.

57:26.914 --> 57:28.816
Remember the deal,
Nicole.

57:28.849 --> 57:30.384
You still have to kiss him.

57:30.417 --> 57:32.052
It's the only way
that this will work.

57:32.086 --> 57:35.556
Are you crazy?
I'm not kissing Piggy Pete.

57:35.589 --> 57:37.191
I have a boyfriend.

57:37.224 --> 57:38.791
Your boyfriend won't know.

57:38.826 --> 57:41.495
Nicole, it's all good.
We got your back.

57:41.528 --> 57:43.564
- You're not in this alone.
- Mm-hmm.

57:43.597 --> 57:45.165
Don't you want
to be in the club?

57:45.199 --> 57:47.201
Yeah, Nicole.

57:49.870 --> 57:52.373
Okay. I'll be in the club.

57:56.076 --> 57:58.445
I did not want to kiss him.

57:58.479 --> 58:01.348
Brandi was such a bad influence
on our lives.

58:01.382 --> 58:05.052
I don't know why
I ever listened to her.

58:05.085 --> 58:08.589
Maybe I was scared of her.
I don't know.

58:08.622 --> 58:12.259
Brandi, Miranda.

58:12.293 --> 58:14.561
It's just so scary, you know?

58:14.595 --> 58:17.331
Yeah.

58:17.364 --> 58:21.201
But you know what?
We're going to be fine.

58:21.235 --> 58:23.337
Bae, we have each other.

58:23.370 --> 58:26.840
We have each other's back.
You got me, I got you.

58:26.874 --> 58:28.142
Okay?

58:28.175 --> 58:30.110
Yeah.

58:30.144 --> 58:32.079
- What kind of wine is this?
- The good kind.

58:32.112 --> 58:33.247
Oh, my God.

58:33.280 --> 58:35.015
Darling.

58:35.049 --> 58:36.417
Nothing less.

58:39.653 --> 58:41.355
Ohh.

58:53.167 --> 58:54.902
Sommer?

59:20.427 --> 59:22.129
Sommer?

59:33.173 --> 59:34.375
Sommer?

01:00:00.968 --> 01:00:02.703
Now, I'm trying my best
to help you out here, Nicole,

01:00:02.736 --> 01:00:05.305
I really am, but you know
how this looks, right?

01:00:05.339 --> 01:00:08.208
What, you think I had something
to do with this? That's insane.

01:00:08.242 --> 01:00:09.943
You were the last one
to see Miranda alive,

01:00:09.977 --> 01:00:11.412
you were the last one
to see Brandi alive,

01:00:11.445 --> 01:00:14.148
and you were in this house
when Sommer was murdered.

01:00:14.181 --> 01:00:15.616
I mean, somebody must be
trying to frame me.

01:00:15.649 --> 01:00:18.018
I apologize, but you got
to come down to the station.

01:00:18.051 --> 01:00:19.186
She didn't do anything.

01:00:19.219 --> 01:00:20.654
- What?
- We'll find out.

01:00:20.687 --> 01:00:21.989
What is this?

01:00:32.633 --> 01:00:35.102
Officer.
When we get her down there,

01:00:35.135 --> 01:00:37.304
I'm gonna get it right into
my interrogation of her.

01:00:37.337 --> 01:00:38.639
- Sir...
- What... What's happening here?

01:00:38.672 --> 01:00:40.541
We're taking your wife down
for questioning.

01:00:40.574 --> 01:00:43.076
Taking my wife?
Babe. Excu... Excuse...

01:00:43.110 --> 01:00:46.079
Hello?
Get your hands off my wife.

01:00:46.113 --> 01:00:47.414
What is going on?

01:00:47.448 --> 01:00:49.249
Babe, are you alright?

01:00:49.283 --> 01:00:51.318
Hey! Hey!

01:00:54.321 --> 01:00:57.024
She'll be alright.

01:00:57.057 --> 01:00:59.226
Babe? B...

01:01:23.183 --> 01:01:27.221
I-I'm sorry for
the inconvenience, Mrs. Taylor.

01:01:27.254 --> 01:01:29.122
You know your husband's waiting
down in the lobby for you.

01:01:29.156 --> 01:01:30.557
He bailed you out.

01:01:30.591 --> 01:01:34.127
But before you go,
I wanted to share this with you.

01:01:37.064 --> 01:01:38.665
We found these
on the crime scene.

01:01:41.168 --> 01:01:44.806
They look familiar?
You know anything about that?

01:01:44.839 --> 01:01:47.140
- I have no clue.
- Mrs. Taylor.

01:01:47.174 --> 01:01:48.810
You must tell me
everything you know

01:01:48.843 --> 01:01:50.544
if you want me to help you.

01:01:56.851 --> 01:01:58.318
P.

01:01:58.352 --> 01:02:00.053
Paige.

01:02:00.087 --> 01:02:01.388
Paige?

01:02:01.421 --> 01:02:03.825
Yeah, I don't...
I don't know her last name.

01:02:03.858 --> 01:02:06.193
My husband was having
an affair with her.

01:02:06.226 --> 01:02:08.228
Ooh.

01:02:08.262 --> 01:02:11.833
I can tell you
where she works.

01:02:11.866 --> 01:02:13.567
He said that she
threatened to hurt me

01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:14.836
if he didn't sleep with her.

01:02:14.869 --> 01:02:16.637
Really?

01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:19.540
Maybe that's what
the P stands for.

01:02:19.573 --> 01:02:21.742
Paige.

01:02:21.775 --> 01:02:24.444
Okay. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

01:02:24.478 --> 01:02:26.179
You're free to go, Mrs. Taylor.

01:02:42.362 --> 01:02:45.198
Hey, babe.

01:02:45.232 --> 01:02:46.366
Are you okay?

01:02:49.403 --> 01:02:50.771
Anybody hurt you in there?
You... Are you alright?

01:02:50.805 --> 01:02:53.407
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

01:02:57.344 --> 01:02:59.680
You leave me
and my wife alone, man.

01:02:59.713 --> 01:03:01.715
I'm just doing my job, man.

01:03:01.748 --> 01:03:05.218
Doing your job.
Obviously not good enough.

01:03:05.252 --> 01:03:06.420
You better hope
you find this person

01:03:06.453 --> 01:03:08.155
and catch 'em before I do.

01:03:19.566 --> 01:03:21.735
Paige Campbell?

01:03:21.768 --> 01:03:23.337
Who wants to know?

01:03:23.370 --> 01:03:24.806
You've been served.

01:03:24.839 --> 01:03:26.506
This is a temporary
restraining order issued

01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:28.475
by the Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Office.

01:03:28.508 --> 01:03:29.710
And you've been ordered to keep

01:03:29.743 --> 01:03:31.411
a no less than 100-yard distance
away from

01:03:31.445 --> 01:03:32.779
Mr. Brian Taylor
and Mrs. Nicole Taylor.

01:03:32.814 --> 01:03:34.348
Do you understand,
Miss Campbell?

01:03:34.381 --> 01:03:36.383
Yeah, but I haven't
done anything wrong.

01:03:36.416 --> 01:03:39.386
Refusing to comply
just gets you arrested.

01:03:39.419 --> 01:03:41.923
Take the package, Miss Campbell.

01:03:41.956 --> 01:03:43.457
That's it, I'm placing you
under arrest right now

01:03:43.490 --> 01:03:44.926
for striking an officer
of the law.

01:03:44.959 --> 01:03:46.660
Give me my... Man, you put
that shit in my face.

01:03:46.693 --> 01:03:48.328
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:03:48.362 --> 01:03:49.696
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

01:03:49.730 --> 01:03:51.465
in a court of law.

01:03:57.471 --> 01:04:00.340
Coffee?

01:04:00.374 --> 01:04:03.845
Miranda Scott, Brandi Smith,
and Sommer Harris...

01:04:03.878 --> 01:04:07.681
They felt your wrath.
Why'd you kill 'em?

01:04:07.714 --> 01:04:09.851
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:04:09.884 --> 01:04:13.286
Yes, you do, Paige.
You sure do.

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:18.592
Or should I call you P?

01:04:18.625 --> 01:04:22.262
I don't know what that is.

01:04:22.295 --> 01:04:24.665
You had no right coming
to my place of business

01:04:24.698 --> 01:04:26.366
disturbing me
with this nonsense.

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:27.634
I haven't done anything.

01:04:27.668 --> 01:04:31.304
Oh, yes, you have, Paige.
You sure have.

01:04:31.338 --> 01:04:34.307
You assaulted an officer.
You resisted arrest.

01:04:34.341 --> 01:04:35.542
That's two things right there.

01:04:35.575 --> 01:04:37.377
That's enough to lock you up,
I'd say.

01:04:37.411 --> 01:04:41.515
You have no idea what you're
getting in the middle of.

01:04:41.548 --> 01:04:43.951
You cops are so ignorant.

01:04:43.985 --> 01:04:46.386
Well, why don't you
enlighten me, Paige?

01:04:46.420 --> 01:04:50.390
I'm not saying anything more
without my attorney present.

01:04:50.424 --> 01:04:53.460
Fine. You don't want to talk,
I don't want to talk either.

01:04:53.493 --> 01:04:55.495
Just know that your fingerprints
is really all I need,

01:04:55.529 --> 01:04:57.531
and you've been processed.

01:04:57.564 --> 01:05:00.500
So if I was you,
I would start talking

01:05:00.534 --> 01:05:02.003
real, real fast

01:05:02.036 --> 01:05:05.739
before my ignorance
leads me to find out something

01:05:05.772 --> 01:05:08.375
that you don't want me
to find out.

01:05:08.408 --> 01:05:10.945
You think you're so smart,
don't you?

01:05:16.583 --> 01:05:17.584
No?

01:05:17.617 --> 01:05:19.586
Officer Mitchell.

01:05:19.619 --> 01:05:22.389
Get her ass out of here.
Lock her up someplace else.

01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:28.830
I need you to check the DNA
on these lip prints.

01:05:28.863 --> 01:05:30.998
Okay. Give me a week,
maybe less.

01:05:31.032 --> 01:05:32.699
- I give you a day.
- A day?

01:05:32.733 --> 01:05:35.635
A day.

01:05:35.669 --> 01:05:37.270
- A day, alright, a day.
- 24.

01:05:37.304 --> 01:05:39.706
Alright, 24 hours.
I got you man, alright.

01:06:39.699 --> 01:06:42.636
I have missed you so much.

01:06:42.669 --> 01:06:44.939
And I'm really sorry,
you know that, right?

01:06:46.974 --> 01:06:49.342
Yeah. I know.

01:06:49.376 --> 01:06:51.745
Yeah, about the whole
Paige thing.

01:06:51.778 --> 01:06:53.513
Mm, we don't even
have to go there.

01:06:53.547 --> 01:06:57.684
No, no, yes, yes, I do.
I have to go there.

01:06:57.717 --> 01:06:59.987
I am so sorry
I wasn't honest with you.

01:07:02.156 --> 01:07:06.994
Yeah, well, look,
that's in the past.

01:07:07.028 --> 01:07:09.429
Really, I just want to
forget about it and move on.

01:07:09.462 --> 01:07:11.464
I made a promise
to be honest with you,

01:07:11.498 --> 01:07:13.533
and I broke that promise.

01:07:13.567 --> 01:07:18.005
And I will never make
that mistake again, ever.

01:07:18.039 --> 01:07:21.741
Oh, we don't have to worry
about her anymore.

01:07:21.775 --> 01:07:24.477
Detective Tucker
took care of it.

01:07:24.511 --> 01:07:27.882
He took care... What?
Are you sure?

01:07:30.918 --> 01:07:36.590
Oh, my God. That is...
That's great news, babe.

01:07:36.623 --> 01:07:40.794
Oh, my... we can actually
just finally go back

01:07:40.828 --> 01:07:44.065
to the way things were
before all this started.

01:07:44.098 --> 01:07:46.633
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God, that's fantastic.

01:08:00.915 --> 01:08:02.616
What?

01:08:09.756 --> 01:08:11.926
I thought you told me that
this woman was taken care of?

01:08:11.959 --> 01:08:14.628
I'm sorry, Mrs. Taylor,
but she was bailed out.

01:08:14.661 --> 01:08:16.595
What?

01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:17.899
Bailed out by who?

01:08:17.932 --> 01:08:19.532
By an anonymous source.
We don't know.

01:08:19.566 --> 01:08:23.970
An anonymous source.
This is absolutely insane.

01:08:24.005 --> 01:08:26.040
How in the world am I supposed
to keep my wife safe

01:08:26.073 --> 01:08:28.809
from this psycho woman
if you two won't help?

01:08:28.843 --> 01:08:30.211
Huh? Huh?

01:08:30.243 --> 01:08:32.947
I told you she was crazy, babe.
She's crazy.

01:08:32.979 --> 01:08:35.950
What if Nicole was home alone?
Huh? What then?

01:08:35.983 --> 01:08:38.019
She could have killed her,
Detective.

01:08:38.051 --> 01:08:39.786
Is that what it's going to take,
somebody else needs to die

01:08:39.819 --> 01:08:41.221
- before you do something?
- Hey, you better relax, man.

01:08:41.255 --> 01:08:42.689
- Brian.
- You'd better relax.

01:08:42.721 --> 01:08:44.158
- No, you relax.
- Brian. Brian.

01:08:44.191 --> 01:08:46.193
You relax. Listen to me.
If something happens to my wife,

01:08:46.227 --> 01:08:47.895
- man, I swear to God.
- Yeah, put your hands down.

01:08:47.929 --> 01:08:49.063
You don't want to
threaten an officer.

01:08:49.095 --> 01:08:50.563
- Stop.
- Okay, alright.

01:08:50.596 --> 01:08:51.731
- Alright, okay.
- Brian, stop.

01:08:51.765 --> 01:08:55.002
- I have this.
- Okay. Alright.

01:08:55.036 --> 01:08:57.671
Look, you have her
on our security cameras twice.

01:08:57.703 --> 01:08:59.706
We don't have proof that
it was her the first time.

01:08:59.738 --> 01:09:02.575
She is clearly the one
who is doing this.

01:09:02.609 --> 01:09:05.511
She's on camera. She's left
notes with her initials on them.

01:09:05.545 --> 01:09:07.647
How much more proof
do you need?

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:09.216
All I can say is
I'm doing the best I can.

01:09:09.250 --> 01:09:12.219
Well, your best
is not good enough.

01:09:12.252 --> 01:09:14.020
You can leave now, Detective.

01:09:17.191 --> 01:09:20.227
Fine.

01:09:20.261 --> 01:09:22.897
We out of here.

01:09:25.799 --> 01:09:26.968
Come here.

01:09:27.001 --> 01:09:28.635
Come here.

01:09:28.667 --> 01:09:32.273
It's alright.

01:09:32.305 --> 01:09:34.640
I got some really
interesting information.

01:09:34.674 --> 01:09:36.810
So we ran the DNA sample
that you gave us.

01:09:36.844 --> 01:09:39.712
Turns out Paige Campbell
isn't even her real name.

01:09:39.746 --> 01:09:43.250
It's Samantha Wells.
That name mean anything to you?

01:09:43.283 --> 01:09:45.118
No. Not at all.

01:09:45.152 --> 01:09:47.787
'Cause that's all the
information I could dig up.

01:09:47.822 --> 01:09:48.923
I hope it helps.

01:09:48.956 --> 01:09:50.157
- Thanks.
- Any time.

01:10:00.201 --> 01:10:03.703
Damn.

01:10:03.737 --> 01:10:05.006
Hey, I need your help
getting a closed file.

01:10:05.039 --> 01:10:06.841
You think you can
help me with that?

01:10:06.874 --> 01:10:08.775
I told a friend I'd be there
to save her ass

01:10:08.809 --> 01:10:11.678
when the time came,
and the time is now.

01:10:11.711 --> 01:10:13.780
Why should I trust you?

01:10:13.814 --> 01:10:15.548
Because I trust her.

01:10:19.619 --> 01:10:22.023
Okay.

01:10:25.359 --> 01:10:27.627
This is from Nicole.

01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:29.796
Hope you guys find
what you're looking for.

01:11:05.866 --> 01:11:07.968
Damn.

01:11:08.002 --> 01:11:10.337
Samantha Wells
is Peter Wells' sister?

01:11:12.873 --> 01:11:14.809
I never even knew
he had a sister.

01:11:14.842 --> 01:11:16.944
Well, apparently nobody did.

01:11:16.977 --> 01:11:19.380
When Peter was a baby
and Samantha was 3,

01:11:19.413 --> 01:11:21.849
Mr. and Mrs. Wells adopted them.

01:11:23.384 --> 01:11:25.820
I told him
the same thing.

01:11:25.853 --> 01:11:27.121
Oh, hello, sir. May I help you?

01:11:27.154 --> 01:11:29.156
Hi, ma'am.
I'm here for Samantha Wells.

01:11:29.190 --> 01:11:31.992
Officer, what's the problem?

01:11:32.026 --> 01:11:34.395
You're under arrest for
the murders of Miranda Scott,

01:11:34.428 --> 01:11:36.130
Brandi Smith, and Sommer Harris.

01:11:36.163 --> 01:11:37.764
What? What is this about?

01:11:37.797 --> 01:11:39.967
What is happening?
I don't understand.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.302
Elda, don't say another word.

01:11:41.335 --> 01:11:42.837
Go back in the house
and call the lawyer.

01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:44.238
Everything's going to be okay.

01:11:44.271 --> 01:11:45.906
But I don't understand
what's going on here.

01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:47.740
A few days after the incident
between you all

01:11:47.774 --> 01:11:49.877
and Peter Wells
at the summer camp,

01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:52.980
Peter Wells committed suicide.

01:11:53.013 --> 01:11:55.950
A year later, Samantha's
living on the streets,

01:11:55.983 --> 01:11:57.418
and she's there for a while,

01:11:57.451 --> 01:12:01.021
but she ended up back
in the foster care system.

01:12:01.055 --> 01:12:04.125
But after that, no one heard
of her until last year

01:12:04.158 --> 01:12:09.263
when she moved back to LA under
the name of Paige Campbell.

01:12:09.296 --> 01:12:11.031
Oh, my God.

01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:16.003
She probably blamed us
for her brother's death.

01:12:16.036 --> 01:12:17.838
Probably.

01:12:17.872 --> 01:12:22.309
Killing and trying to make it
look like a suicide.

01:12:22.343 --> 01:12:24.145
She wanted you
to know it was her.

01:12:24.178 --> 01:12:26.881
She wanted to take my husband
away from me as payback.

01:12:26.914 --> 01:12:29.984
Listen. You said you and your
friends played a joke on Peter?

01:12:30.017 --> 01:12:32.652
Who exactly was there?

01:12:34.787 --> 01:12:40.327
It was Miranda, Brandi,
Sommer, and myself.

01:12:40.361 --> 01:12:42.196
You were going to be the fourth.

01:12:42.229 --> 01:12:45.366
- She was saving you for last.
- Officer!

01:12:45.399 --> 01:12:47.067
You have the right
to an attorney.

01:12:47.101 --> 01:12:48.969
If you cannot afford one,
one will be provided for you

01:12:49.003 --> 01:12:50.803
by the court.
Do you understand your rights?

01:12:50.838 --> 01:12:52.907
I don't even know what
precinct you're taking her to.

01:12:52.940 --> 01:12:54.408
Could you at least tell me that?

01:12:54.441 --> 01:12:55.976
Ma'am, please go back inside.

01:12:56.010 --> 01:12:58.979
Oh, this is just ridiculous!
Ridiculous!

01:12:59.013 --> 01:13:01.448
I'm going to call
somebody for you, baby.

01:13:01.482 --> 01:13:04.351
God, this is a nightmare.

01:13:06.453 --> 01:13:09.056
Well, the nightmare's
over now, okay?

01:13:09.089 --> 01:13:11.458
We got Samantha.

01:13:11.492 --> 01:13:13.793
We good.

01:13:13.827 --> 01:13:17.198
She won't be hurting
nobody no time soon.

01:13:17.231 --> 01:13:20.134
"We the jury find
the defendant, Samantha Wells,

01:13:20.167 --> 01:13:25.506
on count one, first-degree
murder of Miranda Scott, guilty.

01:13:25.539 --> 01:13:28.275
On count two, we the jury
find the defendant,

01:13:28.309 --> 01:13:30.477
Samantha Wells,
in the charge of murder

01:13:30.511 --> 01:13:34.882
in the first degree
of Brandi Smith, guilty.

01:13:34.915 --> 01:13:39.019
On count three, we the jury find
the defendant, Samantha Wells,

01:13:39.053 --> 01:13:40.854
in the charge of murder
in the first degree

01:13:40.888 --> 01:13:43.290
of Sommer Harris, guilty."

01:13:43.324 --> 01:13:47.328
Samantha Wells, you have been
found guilty on all counts.

01:13:47.361 --> 01:13:49.930
Sentencing will be
at a later date.

01:13:49.964 --> 01:13:51.865
Court is adjourned.

01:13:51.899 --> 01:13:54.068
All rise for
the Honorable Judge Atwood.

01:14:05.579 --> 01:14:08.415
Congratulations.

01:14:08.449 --> 01:14:10.084
And I'm sorry for being
such a jerk, man.

01:14:10.117 --> 01:14:11.418
It's just my wife's safety's

01:14:11.452 --> 01:14:13.254
the most important thing to me,
you know?

01:14:13.287 --> 01:14:15.522
Nah, nah, nah, it's okay.
I'm just happy y'all safe now.

01:14:15.556 --> 01:14:17.790
- Yeah.
- Yeah, me too.

01:14:17.825 --> 01:14:20.793
Thank you, Detective.

01:14:20.828 --> 01:14:23.964
No, thank you.

01:14:23.998 --> 01:14:25.099
Thank you.

01:14:25.132 --> 01:14:26.400
You got it, man.

01:14:42.383 --> 01:14:44.451
There she is.

01:14:44.485 --> 01:14:46.553
You all ready to go, babe?

01:14:46.587 --> 01:14:49.256
- Bag is packed, face is on.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

01:14:49.290 --> 01:14:51.992
Just have to put my dress on,
and then I'm all yours.

01:14:52.026 --> 01:14:53.894
Oh, well, I made
your favorite tea.

01:14:53.927 --> 01:14:56.530
- Aww.
- Boom.

01:14:56.563 --> 01:15:00.134
Can you believe it?
Four years ago, babe.

01:15:00.167 --> 01:15:06.373
I married the most beautiful
woman in the entire world.

01:15:06.407 --> 01:15:08.909
- Happy anniversary.
- Happy anniversary.

01:15:08.942 --> 01:15:12.479
Mm. Well, guess what?

01:15:12.513 --> 01:15:14.581
- Hmm?
- What?

01:15:14.615 --> 01:15:17.518
I have an entire night
planned for you.

01:15:17.551 --> 01:15:20.287
And I know everything's been
a bit of a train wreck lately,

01:15:20.321 --> 01:15:24.425
but just for tonight I want us
to just forget about everything,

01:15:24.458 --> 01:15:27.294
focus on us.

01:15:27.328 --> 01:15:29.496
- I like that idea.
- Mm.

01:15:29.530 --> 01:15:31.999
Drink up now. Drink it up.

01:15:32.032 --> 01:15:34.501
You need some energy
for what we doing tonight.

01:15:34.535 --> 01:15:39.473
- Ooh?
- Uh-huh.

01:15:39.506 --> 01:15:42.276
It's a surprise.

01:15:42.309 --> 01:15:44.144
I love surprises.

01:16:05.232 --> 01:16:06.200
Yeah?

01:16:06.233 --> 01:16:08.102
Oh, hey, Kenny.

01:16:08.135 --> 01:16:11.572
Okay. Sure.

01:16:20.681 --> 01:16:23.150
You got to be kidding me.

01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:35.529
Nicole?

01:16:35.562 --> 01:16:37.297
Nicole?

01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:42.403
Come out,
come out wherever you are.

01:16:51.612 --> 01:16:54.548
Brian?

01:16:56.583 --> 01:16:58.118
Brian?

01:17:14.601 --> 01:17:16.603
Nicole.

01:17:16.637 --> 01:17:19.573
Nicole, come out
wherever you are.

01:17:28.649 --> 01:17:31.318
Come on.

01:17:34.087 --> 01:17:36.256
Come on.

01:17:41.562 --> 01:17:44.364
Come on. Come on.

01:17:46.300 --> 01:17:48.235
Come on.

01:17:57.678 --> 01:18:00.013
Hurry up, come on.

01:18:21.468 --> 01:18:24.638
Nicole! It's Detective Tucker!

01:18:27.641 --> 01:18:28.775
Hey!

01:18:28.810 --> 01:18:31.478
Hey! Hi!

01:18:31.512 --> 01:18:34.348
Is everything okay?
I actually... I live next door.

01:18:34.381 --> 01:18:36.583
No, no, I'm looking
for Brian and Nicole.

01:18:36.617 --> 01:18:39.253
Actually it's their anniversary,
so they may be gone.

01:18:39.286 --> 01:18:40.554
Do you know where they are?

01:18:40.587 --> 01:18:42.189
You got me there.
No, I don't, I'm sorry.

01:18:42.222 --> 01:18:44.224
Jesus.

01:18:44.258 --> 01:18:45.592
Damn it.

01:18:45.626 --> 01:18:48.195
Damn it.

01:18:48.228 --> 01:18:50.497
I hope everything's
going to be okay.

01:18:50.531 --> 01:18:52.366
Geez.

01:18:59.673 --> 01:19:01.441
Come on.

01:19:21.728 --> 01:19:24.097
Piggy Pete.

01:19:34.441 --> 01:19:36.143
Nicole?

01:19:41.748 --> 01:19:44.117
This is where
I had my first kiss.

01:19:46.753 --> 01:19:49.857
It was with you.

01:19:49.891 --> 01:19:51.859
Peter.

01:19:57.899 --> 01:20:02.302
So, you figured it out.

01:20:08.241 --> 01:20:10.744
I don't understand.

01:20:10.777 --> 01:20:14.147
We were just kids.
We didn't mean to hurt you.

01:20:14.181 --> 01:20:17.384
No. Don't act all innocent,
Nicole.

01:20:17.417 --> 01:20:20.754
You... You guys, you know
what you did out there.

01:20:20.787 --> 01:20:22.522
You know what you did to me.

01:20:24.625 --> 01:20:30.163
You killed me, Nicole,
you and your little friends.

01:20:35.669 --> 01:20:37.872
Wait, this one, alright.

01:20:48.548 --> 01:20:50.250
Peter, wake up!
Nicole's in trouble.

01:20:50.283 --> 01:20:52.820
- Come on, hurry.
- I'm coming.

01:20:57.591 --> 01:20:59.927
- Nicole! Come on, let's go!
- Come on, jump!

01:20:59.961 --> 01:21:01.328
- Come on, she's drowning!
- Save her!

01:21:01.361 --> 01:21:03.597
- She's drowning!
- She can't swim!

01:21:08.402 --> 01:21:09.971
Help!

01:21:10.004 --> 01:21:12.239
I can't swim!

01:21:12.272 --> 01:21:14.741
You guys, if he keeps shouting,
we're saving him.

01:21:14.775 --> 01:21:16.610
We have to, Sommer,
go get help now.

01:21:16.643 --> 01:21:18.980
Okay, okay.

01:21:19.013 --> 01:21:20.982
- I'm out of here.
- Help!

01:21:21.015 --> 01:21:23.951
Brandi, we can't let him drown.
Help me get him out of here.

01:21:23.985 --> 01:21:25.519
I'm sorry, Nicole.
You're on your own.

01:21:25.552 --> 01:21:27.688
I cannot get in trouble
for this.

01:21:29.723 --> 01:21:31.893
Don't leave me here.

01:21:36.797 --> 01:21:39.766
Peter! Peter,
it's going to be okay.

01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:42.736
I'm sorry.

01:21:42.769 --> 01:21:43.971
Peter, grab my hand.

01:21:53.047 --> 01:21:57.718
I jumped in that water
to save you, Nicole,

01:21:57.751 --> 01:21:59.854
and you let me drown.

01:21:59.887 --> 01:22:03.423
No. No, that's...
That's not what happened.

01:22:03.457 --> 01:22:04.892
You have this all wrong.

01:22:04.926 --> 01:22:06.994
But you can't kill me.

01:22:07.028 --> 01:22:11.465
I'm... I was too strong.

01:22:11.498 --> 01:22:13.000
Yeah.

01:22:13.034 --> 01:22:15.569
He's still not breathing.
We need to rush him to the ER.

01:22:24.611 --> 01:22:26.546
You stopped breathing,
but you would have died

01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:27.982
if I didn't try to save you.

01:22:28.015 --> 01:22:30.450
You know I tried
to kill myself that summer?

01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:34.989
Yeah.

01:22:35.022 --> 01:22:38.391
Samantha,
she found me in the room.

01:22:38.425 --> 01:22:42.063
Alone, bleeding
from my wrist.

01:22:42.096 --> 01:22:45.066
And our foster parents,
they were...

01:22:45.099 --> 01:22:48.401
they were...
they were going to put me away.

01:22:51.404 --> 01:22:53.841
So she took me and we...
we just... we ran.

01:22:53.875 --> 01:22:55.076
We ran away.

01:22:55.109 --> 01:22:59.379
And we were on the street
alone for months

01:22:59.412 --> 01:23:00.848
before they found us again,

01:23:00.882 --> 01:23:04.584
and then back into the system
we went, you know?

01:23:04.618 --> 01:23:07.621
Two kids, just nowhere to go.

01:23:07.654 --> 01:23:11.558
And that's... that's kind of

01:23:11.591 --> 01:23:16.097
when everything really
just changed for us.

01:23:16.130 --> 01:23:18.732
- Elda.
- Mm-hmm.

01:23:20.968 --> 01:23:24.071
Ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding.

01:23:33.114 --> 01:23:36.951
Oh, Elda.
She was... She was so nice.

01:23:36.984 --> 01:23:39.619
She... She... She took us in,
and we were...

01:23:41.956 --> 01:23:45.559
She gave me a new name.

01:23:45.592 --> 01:23:51.698
And gave us new life, you know?

01:23:51.731 --> 01:23:55.837
Like, I really started
to feel good about myself.

01:23:55.870 --> 01:24:00.808
And I was healing.

01:24:03.510 --> 01:24:07.514
Until that one day years later,

01:24:07.547 --> 01:24:10.017
I... I saw you, saw you,

01:24:10.051 --> 01:24:12.019
you and your...
your... your friends

01:24:12.053 --> 01:24:18.625
just passing by me
at your school and...

01:24:18.658 --> 01:24:20.460
That's when it hit me.

01:24:20.493 --> 01:24:27.869
I decided to make it my purpose
to get my revenge.

01:24:27.902 --> 01:24:32.572
And I wasn't...

01:24:32.606 --> 01:24:36.143
Piggy Pete anymore.

01:24:36.177 --> 01:24:38.079
I was Brian Taylor.

01:24:38.112 --> 01:24:40.747
How is this possible?

01:24:40.780 --> 01:24:43.683
How is it possible?
Oh, my God.

01:24:43.717 --> 01:24:48.856
Oh, my God, it was...
it was so easy.

01:24:48.890 --> 01:24:52.592
I was there
the whole entire time,

01:24:52.626 --> 01:24:55.495
you know, throughout
high school, college.

01:24:55.528 --> 01:24:58.465
You just can't even notice me.

01:25:04.939 --> 01:25:06.706
The entire time.

01:25:06.740 --> 01:25:09.676
I-I-I just followed you.

01:25:09.709 --> 01:25:12.445
I knew your every move
better than you did.

01:25:12.479 --> 01:25:16.483
I knew you'd message me back,
I knew what to say,

01:25:16.516 --> 01:25:19.053
I knew exactly what you wanted
to hear, Nicole,

01:25:19.086 --> 01:25:21.088
what you needed to hear.

01:25:23.224 --> 01:25:26.193
And then we met again.

01:25:26.227 --> 01:25:28.561
For the first time.

01:25:49.016 --> 01:25:52.719
A-And now, you know,

01:25:52.752 --> 01:25:58.092
I went through so much.

01:25:58.125 --> 01:26:04.165
Things a-a-a child should
never have to experience.

01:26:06.599 --> 01:26:09.170
All because of you.

01:26:09.203 --> 01:26:14.976
You, Brandi, and Miranda,
and Sommer.

01:26:15.009 --> 01:26:19.779
And they all got
what the deserved.

01:26:24.751 --> 01:26:26.486
Now it's your turn.

01:29:34.475 --> 01:29:37.111
Nicole!

01:30:18.285 --> 01:30:22.489
Doesn't have to end like this.

01:30:22.523 --> 01:30:24.892
We could start
a new life, Nicole.

01:30:27.861 --> 01:30:30.164
I love you.

01:30:30.197 --> 01:30:32.399
I...

01:30:32.433 --> 01:30:35.502
Nicole, where are...

01:30:35.536 --> 01:30:38.305
Nicole!

01:30:38.339 --> 01:30:40.441
Nicole!

01:30:40.474 --> 01:30:43.010
Oh!

01:32:00.654 --> 01:32:06.360
Hey. Hey, Nicole.

01:32:06.393 --> 01:32:09.129
It's... It's me.

01:32:09.163 --> 01:32:14.601
It's me, Peter.
Do you remember? Huh?

01:32:14.635 --> 01:32:18.572
Yeah, you remember.
You s... You saved me once.

01:32:18.605 --> 01:32:20.307
Yeah.

01:32:28.649 --> 01:32:32.152
Now, who's... who's...
who's going to save you?

01:32:32.186 --> 01:32:36.323
Brian. Peter. Don't do this.

01:32:36.357 --> 01:32:39.960
Don't... Don't do this? Don't...

01:32:39.993 --> 01:32:43.230
You know that I've...
I've been...

01:32:43.263 --> 01:32:50.070
I've been waiting all these
years for... for today.

01:32:50.104 --> 01:32:54.408
This exact moment.

01:32:54.441 --> 01:32:56.443
This very moment.

01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:04.485
Always and forever, baby.

01:34:18.559 --> 01:34:22.262
Peter, please.

01:34:57.531 --> 01:35:00.634
Nicole.

01:35:00.667 --> 01:35:02.636
Are you okay?

01:35:02.669 --> 01:35:04.438
Yeah.

01:35:06.707 --> 01:35:08.609
Need you to check on her.

01:35:50.450 --> 01:35:53.253
Always...

01:35:53.287 --> 01:35:55.656
And forever.

01:36:18.138 --> 01:36:23.138
