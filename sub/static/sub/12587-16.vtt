<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:33.075 --> 00:34.793
Gracie sure spits up a lot.

00:34.993 --> 00:37.462
She's definitely
her father's child.

00:37.454 --> 00:38.626
Wow.

00:38.622 --> 00:40.875
This is a particularly
good mail day.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.171
Paycheck...

00:42.167 --> 00:43.885
auto club magazine...

00:43.877 --> 00:46.426
jury duty notice.

00:46.421 --> 00:47.468
Oh, no.

00:47.464 --> 00:49.512
West Arlen Youth Baseball.

00:51.718 --> 00:53.516
Is it already time
to sign up Bobby

00:53.512 --> 00:55.059
for another season of baseball?

00:55.055 --> 00:57.854
Or maybe this is the year
we forget to.

00:57.849 --> 00:59.271
People forget things.

00:59.268 --> 01:01.817
See, Peggy,
it's completely believable.

01:01.979 --> 01:04.653
Hank, Bobby loves
playing baseball.

01:04.647 --> 01:06.742
And soon, he'll be all grown up,

01:06.733 --> 01:08.781
and all we will have
is memories.

01:08.777 --> 01:10.700
The memories.

01:14.783 --> 01:16.831
That's my boy.

01:18.328 --> 01:20.376
That's my boy?

01:22.124 --> 01:24.377
That... boy.

01:27.796 --> 01:30.845
I just can't sit in the stands
for another season

01:30.841 --> 01:34.516
of parents looking at me
with such... pity.

01:34.511 --> 01:36.354
This never arrived.

01:36.346 --> 01:38.064
You didn't see anything.

01:38.056 --> 01:39.854
But you're not making any sense.

01:39.850 --> 01:41.443
That did arrive.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.608
I saw something.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.527
Hey,Joseph just told me

01:45.522 --> 01:47.274
the baseball forms came.

01:47.274 --> 01:48.867
I can't wait

01:48.859 --> 01:50.657
to play!

01:50.652 --> 01:52.074
Now, where did I put that thing

01:52.070 --> 01:53.868
you wear on your hand
to catch the ball?

01:53.864 --> 01:56.162
I love that thing!

02:06.877 --> 02:10.050
They sure make protective cups
look pretty these days.

02:10.047 --> 02:12.800
Bobby might just have
to fight me for this one.

02:15.344 --> 02:16.721
Baseball,huh?

02:16.720 --> 02:18.848
So, you're really
going to do this again?

02:18.847 --> 02:20.849
Apparently,

02:20.849 --> 02:23.523
I found the
batting gloves I want.

02:23.518 --> 02:25.316
Look at me, I'm a chicken!

02:32.611 --> 02:33.612
Hey, Hank.

02:33.612 --> 02:35.535
Getting Bobby outfitted
for the season?

02:35.530 --> 02:37.077
Uh, yep.

02:37.074 --> 02:38.417
Again?

02:38.408 --> 02:39.660
Yep.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.253
I'm sorry, buddy.

02:41.244 --> 02:42.871
Hey, check this out.

02:42.871 --> 02:46.250
South Arlen started up
their own baseball league.

02:46.249 --> 02:48.343
Arlen South Youth Baseball?

02:48.335 --> 02:49.837
Never heard of it.

02:49.836 --> 02:52.089
I don't know anyone
who plays there.

02:52.089 --> 02:54.842
Which means nobody knows me.

02:54.841 --> 02:56.343
Or Bobby.

02:56.343 --> 02:58.391
A clean slate.

03:05.394 --> 03:06.611
Get it off me.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.150
Oh, it's eating my face!

03:10.357 --> 03:11.859
This place is great.

03:11.858 --> 03:13.405
The newly-cut grass,

03:13.402 --> 03:15.200
the freshly-squeezed
lemonade.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.618
Exactly like my childhood...

03:17.614 --> 03:18.866
should have been.

03:18.865 --> 03:20.663
Skills Day?

03:20.659 --> 03:22.832
These kids are being
scrutinized and analyzed

03:22.828 --> 03:24.626
like a herd of cattle
at auction.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.248
Which makes perfect sense.

03:26.248 --> 03:28.751
Where do you think
Kobe beef comes from?

03:28.750 --> 03:31.299
Japanese baseball players.

03:31.294 --> 03:33.843
Uh-oh, is that
Chet McKay?

03:33.839 --> 03:35.591
No.

03:35.590 --> 03:38.844
Just another idiot
with adult braces.

03:38.844 --> 03:41.848
Well, I think it's safe to say
I don't know anyone here.

03:41.847 --> 03:44.691
I tell you what, it's nice
to make a fresh start.

03:44.683 --> 03:48.404
I feel like a serial killer
who relocated to Mexico.

03:48.395 --> 03:51.194
Number 231, Bobby Hill.

03:51.189 --> 03:52.816
Okay, Bobby.

03:52.816 --> 03:54.159
Be discreet.

04:02.868 --> 04:04.040
Hi, there.

04:04.035 --> 04:05.582
Are you Bobby's father?

04:05.579 --> 04:06.876
I'm Coach Bradford.

04:06.872 --> 04:08.749
Bobby will be playing
for me on the Stingers.

04:08.749 --> 04:09.875
Ah... hello, Coach.

04:09.875 --> 04:12.924
Uh, you know those chubby kids
that can't run,

04:12.919 --> 04:15.843
but can whack the hell
out of a ball?

04:15.839 --> 04:18.137
Well, Bobby's not one of them.

04:18.132 --> 04:20.851
Uh, sorry if he costs you
any wins.

04:20.844 --> 04:23.723
In my experience, only
losers talk about winning.

04:23.722 --> 04:25.315
Winning's for losers.

04:25.307 --> 04:27.480
I'm about support
and opportunity.

04:27.476 --> 04:29.774
I don't make wins;
I make winners!

04:29.770 --> 04:32.774
Delicious, nutritious winners.

04:32.939 --> 04:34.236
And the happy by-product is,

04:34.232 --> 04:35.859
by the time I'm done
with your son,

04:35.859 --> 04:37.827
he's going to be a hell
of a ballplayer.

04:38.862 --> 04:41.240
Uh, well, I appreciate
the effort,

04:41.239 --> 04:44.789
but I know Bobby,
and that's not really realistic.

04:44.785 --> 04:45.877
Of course it is.

04:45.869 --> 04:47.542
That's what this organization
is all about.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.710
See, ASYB is a strong network

04:49.706 --> 04:52.585
of parents and volunteers
all with one goal:

04:52.584 --> 04:55.087
making better ballplayers
and better children.

04:55.086 --> 04:57.009
Parents and volunteers?

04:57.005 --> 04:58.803
Can anyone make better children,

04:58.799 --> 05:00.847
even if they never
made children?

05:00.842 --> 05:02.059
They sure can.

05:02.052 --> 05:03.850
Non-parental volunteers
are the most dedicated

05:03.845 --> 05:05.643
and admired members of our team.

05:05.639 --> 05:06.765
I'm in!

05:06.765 --> 05:08.813
Take that, Big Brothers!

05:10.519 --> 05:12.863
Okay, Bobby, this
is a pitch and go drill.

05:12.854 --> 05:15.403
He pitches;
you swing and go.

05:15.398 --> 05:16.820
Hit, no hit, you go.

05:16.817 --> 05:17.864
Got it?

05:17.859 --> 05:19.236
You hit, and what do you do?

05:19.236 --> 05:20.237
I go.

05:20.237 --> 05:21.329
You sure do!

05:21.321 --> 05:22.868
And not just to first base,

05:22.864 --> 05:25.117
but to every got-dang dream
you'll ever chase!

05:31.414 --> 05:33.883
Leg it out, leg it out!

05:33.875 --> 05:35.718
Leg it out!

05:35.710 --> 05:37.883
Leg it out, leg it
out, leg it out!

05:37.879 --> 05:40.007
You are a child with potential!

05:40.006 --> 05:41.849
You are a reservoir of hope!

05:41.842 --> 05:43.014
You are a winner!

05:43.009 --> 05:44.852
I am proud of you!

05:45.929 --> 05:49.308
You're making me
proud of me, too.

05:54.145 --> 05:56.364
Uh, about your outfit, Bill...

05:57.691 --> 05:58.692
No.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.740
I wear Arlen
South Youth Baseball

06:00.735 --> 06:01.827
on the outside

06:01.987 --> 06:03.864
because I'm Arlen
South Youth Baseball

06:03.864 --> 06:05.161
on the inside.

06:05.156 --> 06:06.373
Hey, Bobby.

06:06.366 --> 06:07.709
How was practice?

06:07.701 --> 06:08.873
Brutal.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.748
I hurt in places
you're always talking about.

06:11.746 --> 06:13.168
Does that mean you want to quit?

06:13.164 --> 06:14.381
Because you can.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.672
You can quit baseball forever.

06:16.668 --> 06:17.669
Quit?

06:17.669 --> 06:18.886
No, I love it.

06:18.879 --> 06:22.053
But right now, I'm too tired
to make it to the house.

06:22.048 --> 06:24.847
Can someone put
down an orange cone

06:24.843 --> 06:27.187
so no one drives on me?

06:34.519 --> 06:36.738
Well, this is the game
right here.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.483
Tying and winning runs
in scoring position.

06:39.482 --> 06:41.029
A hit, we win.

06:41.026 --> 06:42.528
An out, we lose.

06:42.527 --> 06:43.699
Hello, Hills.

06:43.695 --> 06:45.117
Good to see you here.

06:45.113 --> 06:46.740
Hey, you look thirsty.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.617
Can I point you toward
the snack stand?

06:48.617 --> 06:50.415
I find nothing
quenches the thirst

06:50.410 --> 06:51.878
quite like a drink...

06:51.870 --> 06:53.668
from the snack stand.

06:53.663 --> 06:54.835
No, Bill, we're good.

06:54.831 --> 06:56.048
We brought water.

06:56.041 --> 06:58.510
Oh... why didn't you just go
to the snack stand,

06:58.501 --> 07:00.299
reach into the till
and help yourself

07:00.295 --> 07:03.640
to the money we rely on to keep
this great program afloat?

07:03.632 --> 07:05.851
Next up, Bobby Hill.

07:05.842 --> 07:06.843
What?

07:06.843 --> 07:09.016
They're putting Bobby in?

07:09.012 --> 07:10.355
He hasn't played all day,

07:10.347 --> 07:12.770
and now the coach
is putting him in with two outs?

07:12.933 --> 07:14.560
Whoo! Oh, yeah, Bobby!

07:14.559 --> 07:15.856
Show them what you got!

07:15.852 --> 07:17.445
No, Bobby, don't!

07:33.662 --> 07:34.834
He did it.

07:34.829 --> 07:36.422
He accidentally did it.

07:36.414 --> 07:40.419
That's as many hits as he had
the last two seasons combined.

07:49.344 --> 07:51.267
Well, I got to hand it
to you, Coach.

07:51.262 --> 07:53.560
I thought you were crazy
putting Bobby in there,

07:53.556 --> 07:55.604
but you must have known
what you were doing.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.352
Yeah, this is what happens

07:57.352 --> 07:59.775
when you support a child.
Huh?

07:59.771 --> 08:03.116
See, I haven't given up on Bobby
the way you have.

08:03.108 --> 08:04.735
Poor kid.
Shameful.

08:04.734 --> 08:05.860
There should be a law.

08:14.285 --> 08:16.834
I can't believe he said
I gave up on Bobby.

08:16.997 --> 08:20.467
I mean, maybe I have,
but it wasn't all at once.

08:20.458 --> 08:23.211
It was a slow, painful process.

08:23.211 --> 08:25.634
I always dreamed
that Bobby

08:25.630 --> 08:28.099
might be the hero
on the ball field one day,

08:28.091 --> 08:29.718
and then, when it
finally happened,

08:29.718 --> 08:30.765
I couldn't enjoy it.

08:30.927 --> 08:32.804
Did you give up on your son?

08:32.804 --> 08:33.851
Yes.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.849
Was it particularly bad
parenting?

08:35.849 --> 08:37.020
Yes.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.188
The important thing is,

08:38.183 --> 08:40.607
you still have time
to overcompensate.

08:40.602 --> 08:43.231
Well, I'm going to start fresh
with Bobby.

08:43.231 --> 08:46.405
From now on, I'm going
to support him no matter what.

08:46.401 --> 08:48.324
You are truly
one of the best fathers

08:48.319 --> 08:51.072
who gave up on his son
and changed his mind about it

08:51.072 --> 08:52.324
that has ever lived.

08:54.242 --> 08:55.869
You're really

08:55.869 --> 08:57.621
going to help
with practice, Dad?

08:57.620 --> 08:59.873
I thought you gave that up
back in T-ball,

08:59.873 --> 09:02.001
that day I struck out looking.

09:04.627 --> 09:06.049
Well, what should we do?

09:06.046 --> 09:07.468
Why is he just standing there?

09:07.464 --> 09:09.592
That'll dang ol'
done strike three, man.

09:13.094 --> 09:15.438
Well, the past is the past.

09:15.430 --> 09:18.354
The important thing is,
I'm here right now.

09:19.392 --> 09:22.066
Great Bobbino!

09:22.062 --> 09:23.109
We're here, Coach.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.401
Ready for practice.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.320
All right, Bobby,
go do some sprints.

09:26.316 --> 09:28.569
So, you want me
to shag some balls

09:28.568 --> 09:29.740
or chalk the field

09:29.736 --> 09:31.113
or lead a pepper drill?

09:31.112 --> 09:32.159
Where do you want me?

09:32.155 --> 09:33.873
As far from the
field as possible.

09:33.865 --> 09:34.787
You come from a position

09:34.949 --> 09:37.077
of negativity, and I
want you to report

09:37.077 --> 09:38.875
to someone who understands
what we're trying

09:38.870 --> 09:40.872
Bill Dauterive.

09:40.872 --> 09:41.873
Maybe some of his

09:41.873 --> 09:44.547
winning attitude
will rub off on you.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.308
I need to talk to you about Coach...
Shh, shh.

09:51.299 --> 09:52.391
No, no, no, no.

09:52.383 --> 09:54.010
You listen to me.

09:54.010 --> 09:57.014
You will double the salt,
or you will find a new place

09:57.013 --> 09:58.811
to peddle your sunflower seeds.

09:58.807 --> 10:00.104
Good-bye.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.101
Yes, sir.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.273
How may I help you?

10:02.268 --> 10:04.145
I came here to help
with practice,

10:04.145 --> 10:06.364
but Bradford won't
let me on the field.

10:06.356 --> 10:09.860
All I want to do is just
watch my son play baseball.

10:09.859 --> 10:11.031
Really?

10:11.027 --> 10:13.871
Last I heard, you wanted
to see him quit baseball.

10:13.863 --> 10:14.864
Watch it, Bill.

10:14.864 --> 10:17.287
I am just looking
for an ass to kick.

10:18.284 --> 10:19.877
I'll give it
to you straight, Hank.

10:19.869 --> 10:22.463
You're seen as a negative
influence around here.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.708
Before anyone lets you
on the baseball field,

10:24.707 --> 10:26.550
you're going to have
to prove yourself,

10:26.543 --> 10:28.545
show your commitment
to the league.

10:28.545 --> 10:29.592
Dang it, Bill.

10:29.587 --> 10:31.260
How am I supposed to do that?

10:36.344 --> 10:38.563
Large suicide, extra diet.

10:38.555 --> 10:39.647
Diet?

10:39.639 --> 10:41.186
You can't put diet in a suicide.

10:41.182 --> 10:42.308
It will ruin it.

10:42.308 --> 10:44.777
What button turns off
the commentary?

10:44.769 --> 10:46.442
Just pour it, jerk.

10:46.437 --> 10:48.235
Hey, isn't that the guy

10:48.231 --> 10:50.359
who gave up on his kid?

10:50.358 --> 10:53.612
Yeah, I wish he'd give up
on the snack stand, too.

10:58.199 --> 11:00.293
Hello, Hank.

11:00.285 --> 11:01.628
I'll have a cheeseburger.

11:01.619 --> 11:05.169
Hold the lettuce,
pickles, cheese, and meat,

11:05.165 --> 11:08.590
and instead of special sauce,
I'd like very special sauce.

11:08.585 --> 11:10.053
Dang it, Dale, move.

11:10.044 --> 11:12.638
Hank, this is not the
kind of service I expect

11:12.630 --> 11:13.847
from my employees.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.763
I am not your employee.

11:15.758 --> 11:19.137
Do you ever want to get on
the field to see Bobby play?

11:21.055 --> 11:24.025
A cheeseless, burgerless
cheeseburger.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.440
How would you like that cooked?

11:28.521 --> 11:30.364
Come on, Bobby,
you're a rainbow--

11:30.356 --> 11:32.654
The fastest rainbow
in the world!

11:32.650 --> 11:34.368
Yeah, ooh.

11:34.360 --> 11:37.159
Whoo, a personal best
by .02 seconds!

11:37.155 --> 11:38.873
That is how you do it!

11:38.865 --> 11:40.833
You're going to be
in the Major Leagues someday.

11:40.825 --> 11:42.998
All right!

11:46.539 --> 11:48.541
Hey, Bobby, I was wondering

11:48.541 --> 11:51.044
if you wanted to hit
the batting cages.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.421
What are you doing?

11:52.420 --> 11:54.798
I'm practicing
my baseball card stance.

11:54.964 --> 11:58.559
Coach said that one day,
if I work really hard,

11:58.551 --> 12:00.770
I could be a Major Leaguer.

12:00.762 --> 12:01.854
What?

12:01.846 --> 12:02.768
I should start figuring out

12:02.931 --> 12:04.808
what team I want to play for.

12:04.974 --> 12:07.523
Chicago has great fans,

12:07.518 --> 12:10.488
but New York has the nightlife.

12:10.480 --> 12:14.030
Well, I'm glad you're excited,
but, uh, it takes a lot of,

12:14.025 --> 12:18.531
uh, ability and whatnot
to be in the big leagues.

12:18.529 --> 12:21.078
Wait, are you saying
you don't believe I can do it?

12:21.074 --> 12:23.543
'Cause Coach sure thinks I can.

12:23.534 --> 12:25.628
Look, I'm glad
you're having fun,

12:25.620 --> 12:28.464
but the big leagues
is quite a stretch.

12:28.456 --> 12:31.551
It's just-- I just-- I don't
want you to be disappointed

12:31.542 --> 12:34.045
when it definitely
doesn't happen.

12:34.045 --> 12:36.844
I'm sorry, Dad,
but I have set my mind to it,

12:36.839 --> 12:39.809
and that means with enough
hard work and dedication,

12:39.801 --> 12:40.768
it'll happen.

12:40.927 --> 12:41.769
Right?

12:41.928 --> 12:44.807
Well, son, uh...

12:46.474 --> 12:50.570
Uh, I think you should play
for the Yankees.

13:00.738 --> 13:03.161
All right, let's show 'em
some stick there, Bobby!

13:03.157 --> 13:05.626
You know, Hank,
staring out the window

13:05.618 --> 13:07.211
sure isn't proving
your commitment

13:07.203 --> 13:08.705
to the organization.

13:08.705 --> 13:09.877
Dang it, Bill,

13:09.872 --> 13:12.045
I need to talk to you
about Coach Bradford.

13:12.041 --> 13:14.794
He's raising Bobby's
expectations,

13:14.794 --> 13:16.216
and that's the wrong direction

13:16.212 --> 13:18.840
for that boy's
expectations to go.

13:18.840 --> 13:19.762
Uh-huh.

13:19.924 --> 13:22.097
Is a little bit of positivity
a bad thing?

13:22.093 --> 13:23.811
Well, sometimes yes.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.847
This isn't going to end well.

13:25.847 --> 13:29.442
Bradford's just setting Bobby up
for one big fall.

13:29.434 --> 13:31.357
Envelopes.

13:31.352 --> 13:32.854
Better get back on task

13:32.854 --> 13:35.448
if you want to get
back on that field.

13:35.440 --> 13:37.613
Now, I'm off
to get wined and dined

13:37.608 --> 13:38.825
by the sunflower seed people.

13:38.985 --> 13:41.329
So you'll have
to answer my calls.

13:41.321 --> 13:44.871
If there's an emergency, you can
reach me on my cell phone.

13:44.866 --> 13:45.833
Understood?

13:52.040 --> 13:53.462
Dang it, what did I miss?

13:53.458 --> 13:55.210
How'd Bobby get to third?

13:59.839 --> 14:00.840
Hello.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.262
It's Bradford.

14:02.258 --> 14:04.852
Who's this--
Bobby's unsupportive dad?

14:04.844 --> 14:06.846
Uh,yes.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.223
Listen, the assistant coach had
to leave.

14:08.222 --> 14:09.223
I'm shorthanded out here.

14:09.223 --> 14:10.475
Maybe you can make some calls,

14:10.475 --> 14:12.022
find someone
to help out on the field.

14:12.018 --> 14:13.645
Well, why don't I come down?

14:13.644 --> 14:17.865
Uh, I believe a child's
potential is like a flower.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.484
Properly nurtured and watered,

14:19.484 --> 14:23.705
it can get, um,
really good at baseball.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.414
Uh, I don't know.

14:25.406 --> 14:27.249
Do you have Bill's permission?

14:27.241 --> 14:28.242
Yes.

14:28.242 --> 14:30.711
Yes, I do, definitely.

14:32.080 --> 14:33.878
Dad, you missed it.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.671
I looked alive out here.

14:35.666 --> 14:37.509
I looked alive!

14:37.502 --> 14:39.630
Well, I'm not going
to miss any more.

14:39.629 --> 14:41.631
We're, uh, short a few boys.

14:41.631 --> 14:42.757
Mind standing in at catcher?

14:42.924 --> 14:44.471
Not a bit.

14:44.467 --> 14:45.719
I played some catcher, uh...

14:45.718 --> 14:47.812
Yeah.

14:55.853 --> 14:57.025
Nice grab.

15:04.195 --> 15:06.163
Be ready in the outfield, Bobby.

15:06.155 --> 15:08.123
He can really give it a ride.

15:12.495 --> 15:13.872
Dang, that kid's fast.

15:13.871 --> 15:15.714
Nice scoop.

15:17.291 --> 15:19.510
Oh, my God, we might have
a play at the plate.

15:20.586 --> 15:22.304
Play's at home, play's at home.

15:25.174 --> 15:26.175
Yeah!

15:26.175 --> 15:27.643
He's out of there!

15:31.848 --> 15:34.818
Mr. Hill hit a kid!

15:41.399 --> 15:43.367
I understand you're Hank Hill?

15:43.359 --> 15:44.406
Yes.

15:44.402 --> 15:46.279
Speak into the
microphone, please.

15:47.864 --> 15:50.868
Look, I'm sorry I hurt that boy,

15:50.867 --> 15:54.542
but it's not like he had to go
to the hospital or anything.

15:54.537 --> 15:57.040
I hit him in the helmet,
for God's sake.

15:57.039 --> 15:59.087
If I may, Mr. Chairman?

15:59.083 --> 16:01.711
Mr. Hill, the boy may
not have lost any blood,

16:01.711 --> 16:05.841
but he lost something more
important-- his innocence.

16:05.840 --> 16:06.807
All because you lied

16:06.966 --> 16:08.843
your way onto that field.

16:08.843 --> 16:11.062
That, sir, was your
greatest offense.

16:11.053 --> 16:13.556
Fine, I'll go back
to the snack stand.

16:13.556 --> 16:15.558
No, you won't,
Mr. Hill.

16:15.558 --> 16:19.108
You are hereby banned
from Arlen South facilities

16:19.103 --> 16:20.275
for life.

16:24.859 --> 16:26.577
Well, I just got off the phone

16:26.569 --> 16:28.571
with the mother
of that boy I hit.

16:28.571 --> 16:29.868
She said he's okay.

16:29.864 --> 16:31.616
She also said some other stuff,

16:31.616 --> 16:34.620
but not in language
I care to repeat.

16:34.619 --> 16:36.838
She's an emotional woman.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.833
I am so sorry you can't be
there to watch Bobby's game.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.505
I'll record the whole thing.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.424
And here,
let me get a shot of you

16:43.419 --> 16:45.592
so we can remember
how sad you were.

16:45.588 --> 16:47.261
Uncle Hank, don't think of it

16:47.256 --> 16:49.850
as being banned
from the baseball league.

16:49.842 --> 16:53.767
Think of it as being welcome
everywhere else.

16:54.847 --> 16:57.066
Hey,son,

16:57.058 --> 16:58.605
don't forget your batting gloves

16:58.601 --> 16:59.853
and your bubble gum chaw.

16:59.852 --> 17:00.853
And listen,

17:00.853 --> 17:02.696
I just want you to know

17:02.688 --> 17:04.816
I really wish I could be
at your game today.

17:04.982 --> 17:07.201
Dad, it's okay
you're not coming.

17:08.653 --> 17:10.826
'Cause Coach is going
to be there.

17:16.117 --> 17:18.086
I'm not going to lie.

17:18.079 --> 17:21.174
I'm sensing some tension here.

17:21.165 --> 17:24.886
And I'm not going to lie--
I'm kind of enjoying it.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.174
Talkin' 'bout ol'
dang ol' Hank, man,

17:26.170 --> 17:28.513
Bill done you up all
kinds of wrong, man.

17:28.506 --> 17:29.849
Well, thanks, Boomhauer.

17:29.840 --> 17:32.389
I'm glad someone here
is making sense.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.137
You think I'm unfair, Hank?

17:34.136 --> 17:37.481
Just be glad I'm allowing you
contact with Bobby at all.

17:37.473 --> 17:38.474
Okay, that does it.

17:38.474 --> 17:39.771
I have had it with you.

17:39.934 --> 17:41.777
Now, do you have
somewhere to be?

17:41.769 --> 17:43.612
'Cause I'd like to know
what direction

17:43.604 --> 17:45.572
I should kick your ass in.

17:45.565 --> 17:46.862
I have to go anyway.

17:46.857 --> 17:48.575
It's almost time for the game,

17:48.568 --> 17:52.038
and unlike some people,
I'm allowed to be there.

17:52.029 --> 17:53.576
Oh, guess what?

17:53.573 --> 17:54.870
Bobby's starting today.

17:54.865 --> 17:56.867
Too bad you can't see it.

17:56.867 --> 17:58.119
Bobby's starting?

17:58.119 --> 17:59.871
He hasn't started in years.

17:59.870 --> 18:02.623
Remember when the stomach flu
was going around?

18:02.623 --> 18:04.250
Bobby's team could only field
eight players,

18:04.250 --> 18:05.877
and he still didn't start.

18:05.876 --> 18:08.846
They actually had a kid playing
"lenter field."

18:08.838 --> 18:11.762
Dang it, this is a
huge moment for Bobby.

18:11.757 --> 18:13.805
I am not going to miss it.

18:18.806 --> 18:22.436
Come on, Stingers,
let's do this.

18:23.811 --> 18:25.859
I'm so proud
of my little right fielder.

18:25.855 --> 18:27.857
You know,
outfield is the new infield.

18:27.857 --> 18:29.985
Batter up.

18:37.617 --> 18:38.869
I got it!

18:38.868 --> 18:40.620
Come on, Bobby, catch this.

18:47.877 --> 18:49.629
Way to get under it, Bobby!

18:49.629 --> 18:51.131
You're a heck of a ballplayer!

19:01.432 --> 19:02.729
Way to swarm the ball, Bobby!

19:02.725 --> 19:04.853
That's what I'm talking about!

19:04.852 --> 19:06.525
But I missed.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.864
That kid in right
is a mess out there.

19:08.856 --> 19:10.574
Weak right field!

19:10.566 --> 19:12.739
What?
Hit it to right.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.584
This is horrible.

19:24.580 --> 19:26.048
I can't let Gracie watch.

19:26.040 --> 19:27.292
Come on, Coach!

19:27.291 --> 19:28.508
Pull Bobby!

19:28.501 --> 19:30.003
What the hell are you doing?!

19:36.384 --> 19:39.228
Hey, Bobby, you can do this!

19:49.105 --> 19:52.780
Coach, Coach, time out.

19:52.775 --> 19:54.368
I'm getting killed out here.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.203
You got to take me
out of the game.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.118
I'm not giving up on you,
Bobbino!

19:58.114 --> 20:00.287
Now, get out there and give it
everything you have!

20:04.578 --> 20:07.832
Dang it, Bradford's just going
to let him squirm out there?

20:20.845 --> 20:22.688
I can't look.
What happened?

20:22.680 --> 20:24.182
Did he catch it?

20:24.181 --> 20:25.683
Oh, my gosh.

20:25.683 --> 20:27.026
He went invisible.

20:27.017 --> 20:28.018
I don't blame him.

20:28.018 --> 20:29.019
Nope,

20:29.019 --> 20:30.521
he got taken out.

20:30.521 --> 20:32.489
The coach didn't know
what was good for Bobby,

20:32.481 --> 20:34.859
but his father did.

20:34.859 --> 20:38.409
Thank God you came, Dad.

20:38.404 --> 20:39.701
Whew.

20:39.697 --> 20:43.076
That must be what it feels like
in baseball hell.

20:43.075 --> 20:46.625
I guess that means
I was never any good, was I?

20:46.620 --> 20:50.875
Well... no, son,
you weren't, but...

20:50.875 --> 20:53.424
you know, there's lots of stuff
you are good at,

20:53.419 --> 20:56.844
like video games and comedy.

20:56.839 --> 21:00.093
You should be very proud
of your comedy.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.720
You know what?

21:02.720 --> 21:04.848
I am.

21:04.847 --> 21:07.441
So, do you think
there's a chance

21:07.433 --> 21:09.856
I would have caught
that last fly ball?

21:09.852 --> 21:11.775
N... No.

21:11.937 --> 21:14.690
Me neither!

21:51.852 --> 21:54.822

Bill... no.</i>
