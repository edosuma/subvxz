WEBVTT

00:01.835 --> 00:04.748
LESLIE: Washington, D.C.
Take a deep breath, Andy.

00:04.904 --> 00:06.042
(EXHALES)

00:06.106 --> 00:08.677
I mean, you can practically
smell the bills becoming laws.

00:08.742 --> 00:09.743
Yeah.

00:09.809 --> 00:12.153
You can taste the sweet sugar
of bureaucracy at work.

00:12.679 --> 00:13.714
That building
looks like a boob.

00:13.847 --> 00:14.882
LESLIE:
Yeah, well, it's not.

00:14.948 --> 00:16.450
ANDY: Oh, yeah, I know.
It's the White House.

00:16.516 --> 00:17.927
No. It's the Capitol.

00:17.984 --> 00:20.362
My amazing lover,
Ben Wyatt, is here

00:20.420 --> 00:21.728
working on
a congressional campaign,

00:21.788 --> 00:23.859
<i>and he took April
with him as his intern.</i>

00:23.923 --> 00:26.870
I'm here to visit,
but I'm also here to work.

00:26.926 --> 00:28.633
Because I have
a very important meeting

00:28.695 --> 00:30.606
where I am going to try
to get federal funding

00:30.663 --> 00:32.643
so we can clean up
the Pawnee River.

00:32.698 --> 00:34.144
<i>It's a bit of a fixer-upper.</i>

00:34.200 --> 00:38.671
Romantic reunions. Government meetings.
Self-guided museum tours.

00:38.738 --> 00:41.617
I mean, am I living
the dream? I don't know.

00:41.674 --> 00:43.517
Did I also just
walk past a food truck

00:43.576 --> 00:45.180
and buy myself
a waffle sundae?

00:45.245 --> 00:46.315
Yes!

00:46.679 --> 00:47.919
Now, take out
your guidebook.

00:47.981 --> 00:49.016
Oh, I didn't
bring a guidebook.

00:49.082 --> 00:50.390
Oh, I brought you one.
You did?

00:50.450 --> 00:51.622
Yeah.
Thank you.

00:51.684 --> 00:52.754
Now, throw it away,

00:52.819 --> 00:55.766
because Leslie Knope is your guidebook.
I didn't...

00:56.089 --> 00:57.966
I didn't mean literally.
I had some notes in it.

00:58.024 --> 01:00.368
Okay. Grab the book and let's
hit the National Mall.

01:00.427 --> 01:02.930
There's a mall? That's awesome.
I need to get some flip-flops.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:24.250 --> 01:26.230
Why are we having a conference room meeting?
Leslie's gone.

01:26.286 --> 01:29.233
Ron has taken initiative and
he is leading the meeting.

01:29.689 --> 01:30.895
(ALL LAUGHING)

01:30.957 --> 01:32.095
He's not joking.

01:32.826 --> 01:35.102
I wanted to let you all know
that I will be throwing

01:35.161 --> 01:38.540
the annual Parks Department
Employee Appreciation barbecue.

01:39.065 --> 01:40.544
You're going to throw
the Leslie Knope

01:40.600 --> 01:44.138
Employment Enjoyment SummerSlam
Grill Jam Fun-splosion?

01:44.504 --> 01:45.642
That's right.

01:45.705 --> 01:47.742
You are going to oversee
the Popsicle-eating contest,

01:47.807 --> 01:50.981
the slip-and-slide-a-thon, the
watermelon carving, the gazpacho-off

01:51.044 --> 01:55.083
and star in a one-woman show about
parks rules and regulations?

01:55.148 --> 01:56.320
<i>Parks and Dolls!</i>

01:56.382 --> 02:00.524
(SINGING) <i>I got your park right here.
 Its name is Ramsett Park</i>

02:00.587 --> 02:04.034
ALL: <i>And its gates are
open from dawn till dark</i>

02:04.090 --> 02:07.435
lam not doing any of that,
which is the point.

02:07.494 --> 02:10.168
Every summer, Leslie
throws a barbecue

02:10.229 --> 02:12.301
to thank the Parks
and Maintenance staff.

02:12.732 --> 02:14.075
<i>It's horrifying.</i>

02:14.134 --> 02:16.341
<i>Barbecues should
be about one thing.</i>

02:16.669 --> 02:18.342
Good shared meat.

02:18.404 --> 02:20.748
There will be
no foofy desserts.

02:20.807 --> 02:23.344
There will be no giant
soap bubble guns.

02:23.409 --> 02:25.821
There will be no adult
men in costumes.

02:26.246 --> 02:30.524
And most of all, there will
be no (BLEEP) vegetables.

02:30.583 --> 02:32.893
Well, Ron, can we at least
have corn on the cob?

02:35.922 --> 02:36.957
No.

02:37.891 --> 02:40.462
LESLIE: "In this temple, as
in the hearts of the people,

02:40.527 --> 02:42.564
"for whom
he saved the Union,

02:42.629 --> 02:45.701
"the memory of Abraham Lincoln
is enshrined forever."

02:45.765 --> 02:47.073
Andy,
what are you doing?

02:47.767 --> 02:50.247
Have you ever seen any of the
National Treasure movies?

02:50.303 --> 02:51.475
Everything in this
city is a clue.

02:51.538 --> 02:53.040
Nothing in that
movie is accurate.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.983
A-ha! A clue.
Check it out.

02:57.110 --> 02:58.282
I think that's just gum.

02:58.344 --> 03:00.119
How do I know this
isn't a treasure map

03:00.180 --> 03:01.215
just waiting
to be unfurled?

03:01.281 --> 03:02.919
Because it's gum.

03:03.349 --> 03:05.158
That's gum.
Yeah.

03:05.218 --> 03:07.721
So, you can see that the color
changes about a third of the way up,

03:07.787 --> 03:09.960
and it's when construction was
actually halted on the monument.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.696
Leslie, this is a
really cool penis

03:11.758 --> 03:13.032
but Ben and April
are meeting us

03:13.092 --> 03:14.594
at the Smithsonian
in 10 minutes.

03:14.661 --> 03:16.004
Let's talk on the way.

03:16.062 --> 03:17.837
1776.
A nation was born.

03:17.897 --> 03:18.932
ANDY: Which nation?

03:20.200 --> 03:23.340
<i>CHRIS: I offered Ron a job last
month, and he turned me down.</i>

03:23.403 --> 03:26.009
And it literally
broke my heart.

03:26.072 --> 03:29.383
But now, I see that this
is truly where he belongs.

03:30.176 --> 03:31.712
Way to be, Ron!

03:32.145 --> 03:34.648
You're really
getting it done, man!

03:35.982 --> 03:37.154
He can't hear me.

03:37.250 --> 03:39.230
Okay, let's begin
the barbecue.

03:39.285 --> 03:41.856
Hey, little guy.
What are you doing?

03:41.921 --> 03:43.093
Oh, no.

03:43.156 --> 03:45.363
Everyone?
Meet your meat.

03:45.425 --> 03:46.961
No.
No.

03:47.026 --> 03:48.937
Ron. Why are you
doing this to us?

03:48.995 --> 03:50.565
Well, in my opinion,
not enough people

03:50.630 --> 03:52.234
have looked their
dinner in the eyes

03:52.298 --> 03:54.141
and considered
the circle of life.

03:54.667 --> 03:57.147
This is your dinner.
His name is Tom.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.511
(LAUGHS)

03:58.571 --> 04:00.209
Burn.
Seriously?

04:00.273 --> 04:02.275
No, I understand
that it's hilarious.

04:02.342 --> 04:04.322
But that is his
given Christian name.

04:04.377 --> 04:06.755
Tom is very smart
and incredibly loyal.

04:06.813 --> 04:08.349
He's basically a dog.

04:08.414 --> 04:10.792
A dog we're going to
cook, chew, and swallow.

04:10.850 --> 04:13.694
Dude, there's kids around here.
RON: Good point.

04:13.753 --> 04:15.699
Which one of you youngsters
wants to help me

04:15.755 --> 04:17.358
drain the blood
from this animal?

04:17.423 --> 04:19.197
If you do a good job,
I'll give you the bladder.

04:19.291 --> 04:21.135
You can blow it up
for a fun play ball.

04:21.327 --> 04:22.328
Hey, Ron.

04:22.395 --> 04:24.397
You're not going to slaughter
that pig here, are you?

04:24.464 --> 04:26.705
Not to worry.
I have a permit.

04:28.635 --> 04:31.081
This just says,
"I can do what I want."

04:31.137 --> 04:35.051
lam the director of the Parks
Department and this is a park.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.348
It's not a Parks thing.

04:36.409 --> 04:39.754
It's against, like, three laws
and a dozen health codes.

04:41.981 --> 04:43.085
Fine.

04:43.616 --> 04:46.062
Barbecue is postponed
until I can go pick up

04:46.119 --> 04:47.689
some meat from
the Food 'n' Stuff.

04:48.187 --> 04:49.495
Let's go, Tom.

04:49.555 --> 04:51.330
No. Pig Tom.

04:51.457 --> 04:52.936
(SNIGGERING)

04:54.661 --> 04:56.732
LESLIE: <i>So, I want to see the
History of the Girl Scouts,</i>

04:56.829 --> 05:00.709
<i>and then Lincoln's pocket watch
and the First Ladies exhibit,</i>

05:00.800 --> 05:03.508
and everything.
I want to see everything.

05:03.569 --> 05:04.673
Andy,
get down from there.

05:04.737 --> 05:06.614
Hey, Leslie, is this the train
from <i>Back</i> to the Future <i>III?</i>

05:06.673 --> 05:08.243
Get down from there.
I think it is.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.720
Hey, buddy. Come on down
from there for me, please.

05:12.211 --> 05:14.657
Sir, you protect our nation's
history and you're a hero.

05:14.714 --> 05:16.557
Yeah. A hero with
something to hide.

05:16.616 --> 05:18.323
Like probably
a treasure map.

05:18.384 --> 05:20.227
Ah! Hey! It's so good to see you.
Hey!

05:20.286 --> 05:21.287
Oh...

05:21.721 --> 05:24.258
It's so great to see you, too.
Yeah.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.530
Yikes.

05:26.726 --> 05:29.263
LESLIE: Okay.
Uh, guys? Let's motor.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.831
Guys. Guys.

05:30.897 --> 05:33.036
Let's go get some astronaut
ice cream or something.

05:33.099 --> 05:34.942
We were thinking
about maybe just...

05:35.001 --> 05:36.981
Uh, maybe we were
going to go back to...

05:37.036 --> 05:38.310
We were going
to have sex.

05:38.371 --> 05:40.317
Okay.
You look great, April.

05:40.373 --> 05:41.818
Sorry, hon. I actually
have to go, too.

05:41.874 --> 05:44.047
No, really? I thought maybe
we could sightsee together.

05:44.110 --> 05:45.714
I know. I have, like,
a thousand meetings.

05:45.778 --> 05:48.759
But I just wanted to come wish you
luck before your presentation.

05:48.815 --> 05:50.294
Oh, but you know
what you should see

05:50.350 --> 05:51.727
while you're here is
George Washington's...

05:51.784 --> 05:53.161
Farewell Address
Candle Stand.

05:53.219 --> 05:54.926
That was the first thing
I was going to see.

05:54.987 --> 05:56.557
God, I love you so much.

05:57.123 --> 05:58.898
Come to my office
as soon as you're done.

05:58.958 --> 06:00.198
Okay?
Okay,

06:00.259 --> 06:02.739
And it was nice
to see you again.

06:02.795 --> 06:04.775
Were you talking to my butt?
(LAUGHS) Yes.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.199
Okay.

06:08.568 --> 06:09.672
Where is Swanson?

06:09.736 --> 06:11.909
Ann, I'm hungry and
my legs are tired.

06:12.238 --> 06:13.273
(GROANS)

06:13.339 --> 06:15.046
It feels like
I just exercised.

06:15.108 --> 06:16.212
Just sit on the ground.

06:16.275 --> 06:17.345
No, Jerry.

06:17.410 --> 06:19.321
It's dirty and I'm wearing
my summer linens.

06:19.379 --> 06:20.483
God,
you're such a baby.

06:20.546 --> 06:22.082
Look, I brought a picnic
blanket from your house.

06:22.148 --> 06:23.957
That's not
a picnic blanket.

06:24.283 --> 06:26.320
That's a merino wool throw
for my Eames chair.

06:26.419 --> 06:27.420
DONNA: Uh-oh.

06:27.487 --> 06:30.491
Do I sense trouble in the
Haverford-Perkins household?

06:30.556 --> 06:31.762
No such luck,
Donna.

06:31.824 --> 06:35.169
Ann and Tom, A.K.A. Haverkins,
is stronger than ever.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.230
Everyone said
it wouldn't last.

06:37.296 --> 06:38.798
And it didn't.

06:39.098 --> 06:42.671
ANN: <i>Shocking that our drunken plan
to move in together wasn't a success.</i>

06:42.735 --> 06:45.045
Let's move in together.
(SIGHS) Totally.

06:45.138 --> 06:47.243
No take-backs when we sober
up, though, partner.

06:47.306 --> 06:49.217
No take-backs,
partner.

06:50.143 --> 06:53.056
After the first day, we realized
we had made a huge mistake.

06:53.112 --> 06:54.113
Huge!

06:54.180 --> 06:56.820
However, everyone was
being so smug about it,

06:56.883 --> 06:58.294
saying there was
no way it would last.

06:58.351 --> 07:00.331
So, we're pretending
to still be together.

07:00.386 --> 07:03.060
That way, no one gets the
satisfaction of being right.

07:03.122 --> 07:04.465
Even though
they are, but still.

07:04.524 --> 07:06.697
More importantly,
I bet Donna $1,000

07:06.759 --> 07:08.397
that we'd be together
for another month.

07:08.461 --> 07:10.065
I can't stress
this enough.

07:10.129 --> 07:13.474
If she finds out that we
broke up, I'll go bankrupt.

07:14.967 --> 07:17.208
Oh, my God.
Food. Food.

07:17.970 --> 07:19.244
Yes. I am returned.

07:19.305 --> 07:21.080
No. Not so fast,
Shirley.

07:21.140 --> 07:23.586
I just have to thaw the meat,
season it, and grill it up.

07:23.643 --> 07:25.179
So, it's going to be a few hours.
ALL: Aw!

07:25.244 --> 07:26.621
No, Ron.

07:26.679 --> 07:29.023
My tummy's rumbling.
It's scary.

07:29.081 --> 07:30.651
Tommy's got
the tum-rums.

07:30.716 --> 07:32.662
Ron? Chris Traeger
feelings update.

07:32.718 --> 07:35.995
I am now feeling that your guests
are getting a little antsy.

07:37.156 --> 07:39.466
Fine. I'll skip a few steps
and speed things up.

07:39.525 --> 07:41.630
There you go. ls there at
least something to drink?

07:41.694 --> 07:42.934
There's beer
in the cooler.

07:42.995 --> 07:44.269
What about for
the children?

07:44.330 --> 07:46.173
You can get water
from that water fountain

07:46.232 --> 07:47.802
and use it to water
down the beer.

07:47.867 --> 07:49.642
Why not just give
the kids water?

07:49.702 --> 07:51.204
I suppose you
could do that.

07:51.270 --> 07:52.681
Now, would everyone
please back off

07:52.738 --> 07:54.217
and just let me
cook in peace?

07:55.308 --> 07:56.753
<i>These people are soft.</i>

07:56.809 --> 07:58.288
They're grill virgins.

07:58.644 --> 08:00.624
But by the time
this day is over,

08:00.680 --> 08:02.523
they will have been
taken by the grill

08:02.582 --> 08:04.220
and delicately
and tenderly

08:04.283 --> 08:06.729
shown the ways
of flavorful meat-love.

08:07.954 --> 08:08.955
Mmm.

08:09.388 --> 08:11.698
The first time
is so beautiful.

08:12.992 --> 08:14.403
<i>LESLIE: Ben and I
are</i> a <i>power couple,</i>

08:14.460 --> 08:16.337
<i>like the Roosevelts
or the Clintons.</i>

08:16.395 --> 08:17.999
<i>I've got a big meeting here.</i>

08:18.064 --> 08:20.510
Ben is off running
a congressional campaign.

08:20.566 --> 08:22.842
I mean, the only way
we could be more awesome

08:22.902 --> 08:25.143
is if we had our own
signature dance move.

08:25.204 --> 08:27.810
Oh, wait. We do.
Three, four...

08:27.874 --> 08:29.444
(VOCALIZING)

08:29.876 --> 08:31.150
(DOOR SLAMS)

08:33.513 --> 08:36.221
I'm Leslie Knope. I have
a 3:00 with Mr. Jepson.

08:36.282 --> 08:37.453
What's this in
reference to?

08:37.517 --> 08:38.962
I'm here to present
my application

08:39.018 --> 08:41.089
for the Federal Riverbed
Preservation Grant.

08:41.153 --> 08:43.360
Oh. Most people just mail
their applications in.

08:43.422 --> 08:45.197
(LAUGHS)
I'm not most people.

08:45.291 --> 08:47.362
Well, Mr. Jepson actually had
to step out for the day.

08:47.426 --> 08:50.202
You can just add your
proposal to that pile there.

08:52.098 --> 08:54.237
Oh. Uh, I'm sorry.
I was told I would have

08:54.300 --> 08:55.779
a face-to-face
meeting with him

08:55.835 --> 08:58.008
so I could make
my case for my town.

08:58.070 --> 08:59.344
Does he have
office hours, or...

08:59.405 --> 09:00.941
He's unavailable for
the rest of the week.

09:01.007 --> 09:03.681
But you can just add the proposal.
He'll get to it.

09:05.444 --> 09:06.548
Okay.

09:10.149 --> 09:12.254
It's kind of
a special application.

09:12.685 --> 09:18.499
You know, there's a CD inside that
plays the sound of a babbling river.

09:18.558 --> 09:21.869
And I was going to play that
while I gave my presentation.

09:21.928 --> 09:23.908
Uh, I was also
going to show a DVD

09:23.963 --> 09:26.500
that had some images
of frolicking river otters.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.637
You know what? I'll
make sure he reads it.

09:28.701 --> 09:29.771
What city is it for?

09:30.369 --> 09:31.575
Pawnee.

09:32.071 --> 09:34.881
Is that Pawnee, Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Kansas,

09:34.941 --> 09:37.353
Missouri, Nebraska,
Oklahoma, or Texas?

09:38.144 --> 09:40.055
Indiana.
Okay.

09:42.381 --> 09:44.657
This is amazing.
Look at this.

09:44.717 --> 09:46.890
This whole place
is your office.

09:46.953 --> 09:48.728
Nope.
This is my office.

09:48.788 --> 09:50.631
Ben, you're fired.
It's my office now.

09:50.690 --> 09:53.068
Boom! You heard the boss.
Scram, Wyatt.

09:53.125 --> 09:54.468
Hey- Hey-

09:54.527 --> 09:55.528
How did it go?

09:55.595 --> 09:57.040
Um, I think okay.

09:57.096 --> 09:58.404
Yeah?
Okay, I think.

09:58.464 --> 10:00.603
Well, I have
a surprise for you.

10:00.666 --> 10:04.705
There's a swanky D.C. cocktail
party at The Hay-Adams.

10:04.770 --> 10:06.977
And I got us
all on the list.

10:07.640 --> 10:09.210
Wow, look at you.
You're a big shot.

10:09.675 --> 10:12.383
ANDY: Hey, Benjamin. How
fancy is this party tonight?

10:12.445 --> 10:16.052
I mean, is it, like, a shorts
or a pants kind of gala?

10:17.183 --> 10:18.526
Pants.
ANDY: Great.

10:18.584 --> 10:21.326
Could we just real quick stop at the
nearest place that has free pants?

10:24.590 --> 10:27.230
I know that Ron doesn't want us
to eat anything before the meat,

10:27.293 --> 10:28.465
but I smuggled
in some candy.

10:28.527 --> 10:29.938
Oh, thank God.
I'm starving.

10:30.763 --> 10:31.833
Raisins?

10:32.198 --> 10:33.370
It's nature's candy.

10:33.432 --> 10:37.209
Now, they're basically grapes,
so remember to pace yourself.

10:38.971 --> 10:41.508
I can't even follow my own advice.
They're so delicious.

10:44.176 --> 10:47.157
Oh, my God. Did you put glitter
in the laundry detergent?

10:47.213 --> 10:49.625
Oh, Yeah. I'm experimenting with
some new entrepreneurial ideas.

10:50.016 --> 10:53.122
That one is called
"SparkleSuds. Dress Loud."

10:53.185 --> 10:55.187
Tom, will you stop putting
glitter in everything?

10:55.254 --> 10:56.631
This morning, you put
glitter in the butter.

10:56.689 --> 10:58.532
"Disco Dairy.
Spread the Party."

10:58.591 --> 11:00.798
No, that's not a good idea.
That's terrible.

11:00.860 --> 11:03.568
Well, the target demographic
isn't angry, middle-aged nurses.

11:03.629 --> 11:04.937
Oh, you know what?
Shh. Stop it.

11:04.997 --> 11:06.635
Hey-
Hey-

11:06.699 --> 11:09.077
I'm going to get in line for some food.
Y'all want anything?

11:09.135 --> 11:10.478
We're good.
We're really good.

11:10.536 --> 11:12.345
No, just spending a little
time with my baby girl.

11:12.805 --> 11:13.806
Ew.

11:14.473 --> 11:15.747
Get off me.

11:16.709 --> 11:17.949
(LAUGHING)

11:18.010 --> 11:20.047
ANDY: There's so much free
food at this party, honey.

11:20.112 --> 11:21.523
I love politics.

11:21.580 --> 11:23.685
Look. I made
a shrimp claw.

11:23.749 --> 11:25.228
I'm really proud
of you, babe.

11:25.284 --> 11:26.524
Now, put your used
plate in my purse.

11:26.585 --> 11:27.723
I almost have
a complete set.

11:27.787 --> 11:29.425
Really? Oh, my God.
You're so smart.

11:29.922 --> 11:31.196
KATE:
They say it will pass,

11:31.257 --> 11:33.999
but we'll only get $400
million instead of $900.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.839
Kate works
at the Pentagon,

11:35.895 --> 11:38.307
and Lacey works
for Eric Cantor.

11:38.364 --> 11:39.468
What do you do,
Leslie?

11:39.532 --> 11:42.240
I was just recently elected.
I'm a councilwoman.

11:42.301 --> 11:44.076
Local government
is so important.

11:44.136 --> 11:46.446
My grandma is on the city
council in her town.

11:46.505 --> 11:48.007
It gives her a reason
to leave the house.

11:48.074 --> 11:49.144
Oh...

11:49.542 --> 11:50.987
Where did you say
you were from?

11:51.043 --> 11:52.249
It's called Pawnee.

11:52.311 --> 11:53.517
Pawnee, Missouri?

11:53.579 --> 11:56.025
Oh, my.
That is so random.

11:56.082 --> 11:58.358
I've been there.
It's totally cute.

11:58.417 --> 12:00.988
Pawnee, Indiana. Pawnee,
Missouri, is a total crap-hole.

12:02.021 --> 12:05.025
Ben and I both did some
amazing things today.

12:05.091 --> 12:08.436
He scored a victory for the
congressional campaign he's working on.

12:08.494 --> 12:13.204
And I was mistaken for Beverly
D'Angelo by a Japanese tourist.

12:13.265 --> 12:16.735
So, pretty big day
for both of us.

12:18.404 --> 12:20.816
Ron, can I have a burger?
I'm hungry.

12:20.873 --> 12:22.875
For the last time
no burgers yet.

12:22.942 --> 12:24.888
I've got ribs and
I've got beef cheek.

12:24.944 --> 12:27.515
Ron, where are
my vegan soy patties?

12:27.580 --> 12:29.355
I gave them to the kids.
They love them.

12:29.415 --> 12:30.723
They're skipping
them across the pond.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.653
Donna, I've got to go
to the boys' room.

12:32.718 --> 12:34.698
Can I have a ride in your car?
Absolutely not.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.062
This barbecue stinks.

12:36.122 --> 12:37.692
I'm saying it.
It stinks.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.293
Do you have any
plates or anything?

12:39.358 --> 12:40.894
I mean, how are we supposed
to eat these rumps?

12:40.960 --> 12:42.735
Ron, if no one takes
me to the bathroom,

12:42.795 --> 12:44.103
I'm just going to have
to go in the trees.

12:44.163 --> 12:46.700
All right.
Forget it.

12:47.399 --> 12:49.504
You have ruined a
perfectly good barbecue

12:49.568 --> 12:51.844
with your demands
and chatter.

12:53.305 --> 12:55.114
Enjoy the rest
of your evening.

13:01.981 --> 13:03.358
(TIRES SCREECHING)

13:07.086 --> 13:08.997
Does anybody feel
like they can't breathe?

13:09.054 --> 13:10.192
I think I need
some fresh air.

13:10.256 --> 13:11.428
We're outside.

13:11.490 --> 13:12.696
God, these women.

13:12.758 --> 13:15.329
They're so smart and
accomplished and pretty.

13:15.995 --> 13:18.532
<i>And they're tall.
Why are they all so tall?</i>

13:18.597 --> 13:21.601
It's like C-SPAN and Neiman
Marcus had kids or something.

13:21.667 --> 13:23.874
Hey. So, there's a couple more
people I want you to meet.

13:23.936 --> 13:26.348
Oh, great. I can't wait to meet,
like, five more tall women.

13:26.772 --> 13:28.274
BEN: Excuse me,
Senators?

13:28.340 --> 13:30.479
Ben Wyatt, from Congressman
Murray's campaign?

13:30.543 --> 13:32.545
Ben, I remember you
from the Kennedy Center.

13:32.611 --> 13:35.182
That's right. I wanted to introduce
my friend, Leslie Knope.

13:35.714 --> 13:37.921
Senators Barbara Boxer
and Olympia Snowe.

13:37.983 --> 13:39.656
Pleasure to meet you.
How do you do?

13:39.718 --> 13:40.992
So, Leslie,
what do you do?

13:41.053 --> 13:44.227
I am a city councilwoman
from Pawnee, Indiana.

13:44.456 --> 13:45.696
But you've probably
never heard of us.

13:45.758 --> 13:46.828
We're small and unimportant.

13:47.326 --> 13:48.703
I'm sure
that's not true.

13:48.761 --> 13:51.037
But it is. We've got
tons of problems.

13:51.096 --> 13:53.975
We're overrun with raccoons
and obese toddlers.

13:54.033 --> 13:55.410
Anyway,
I'm probably boring you.

13:55.467 --> 13:58.778
I just wanted to say that
you are my role models

13:58.838 --> 14:01.819
and you are incredibly
amazing women,

14:01.874 --> 14:03.114
and it is an honor
to meet you,

14:03.175 --> 14:05.781
and I really respect
your grace under pressure.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.984
And thank you
for your time.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.625
Excuse me, Senators.

14:15.621 --> 14:17.032
Uh, Leslie?

14:18.023 --> 14:19.195
Hello?

14:19.491 --> 14:20.936
What's going on?
Nothing. (SIGHS)

14:21.360 --> 14:22.668
I'm just tired. Okay?

14:22.728 --> 14:24.799
I saw 24 historical
sites in a day.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.777
And it's 120 degrees
out with 200% humidity,

14:27.833 --> 14:29.403
because this is
a stupid swamp town.

14:29.468 --> 14:30.913
Okay. That would
make anyone cranky.

14:31.070 --> 14:32.879
I'm not cranky.
Okay.

14:32.938 --> 14:35.976
I thought you'd enjoy
meeting numbers 4 and 26

14:36.041 --> 14:37.748
on Leslie's
List of Amazing Women.

14:37.810 --> 14:39.289
I do. I did.

14:40.045 --> 14:42.184
You're the most
amazing boyfriend ever.

14:42.248 --> 14:43.693
And if you don't
get out of here soon,

14:43.749 --> 14:44.955
I'm going to punch
you in the face.

14:45.551 --> 14:47.895
Journal needs a quote
for the profile.

14:48.420 --> 14:49.421
(sums)

14:49.755 --> 14:51.325
It's fine. Just go.

14:51.390 --> 14:52.869
I'll see you
at your apartment later.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.234
This is Ben Wyatt.

15:00.165 --> 15:02.475
Excuse me. I just need
to get my coat here.

15:02.534 --> 15:04.138
Could you give me
a minute here, please?

15:05.237 --> 15:07.513
Are you okay? Can I
get you anything?

15:07.573 --> 15:08.779
I would like you
to just leave

15:08.841 --> 15:10.821
and give me a little
privacy here, please.

15:10.876 --> 15:12.014
All right.
I'm sorry.

15:12.077 --> 15:13.954
I hope everything's okay.

15:14.680 --> 15:15.715
(sums)

15:15.781 --> 15:18.887
Nosy people have no respect
for personal space.

15:23.455 --> 15:25.435
Ann. What the hell?

15:25.524 --> 15:26.628
(LAUGHS)

15:26.692 --> 15:29.036
I put glitter in all your
moisturizers and lotions.

15:29.094 --> 15:31.438
I'm calling it
"SparkleSkin by Annie.

15:31.997 --> 15:33.874
"Twinkle, Twinkle,
Big Star." Ann.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.606
That is an amazing idea,
and I will buy it from you.

15:36.702 --> 15:37.703
But never do that again.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.147
That was really
expensive moisturizer.

15:39.371 --> 15:41.214
Yeah, well, you ruined
all of my clothes.

15:41.273 --> 15:43.685
Well, then, I did you a huge
favor, because they stink.

15:43.742 --> 15:45.312
Are you serious?
Yes.

15:45.377 --> 15:46.879
Oh, hello, lovers.

15:48.647 --> 15:49.990
Tom. You're amazing.

15:50.816 --> 15:51.954
Kiss me more.

15:52.551 --> 15:53.962
Uh-huh. All right.
Enough of this.

15:54.019 --> 15:55.760
Y'all broke up a long time
ago, didn't you? TOM: No.

15:56.255 --> 15:57.825
We're stronger
than ever. So...

15:57.890 --> 16:00.496
It's all right. I'm going
to let y'all have this one.

16:00.559 --> 16:03.699
As someone who has lied
a lot about various aspects

16:03.762 --> 16:05.332
of a myriad
of relationships,

16:05.698 --> 16:07.336
I respect the effort
you've gone to.

16:07.900 --> 16:08.901
Let's call off the bet.

16:09.201 --> 16:10.202
Thanks, Donna.

16:10.369 --> 16:11.473
No problem.

16:12.004 --> 16:14.006
I guess that's it.
Yep.

16:14.673 --> 16:15.879
The end of
a relationship,

16:16.075 --> 16:18.419
and the beginning
of a partnership.

16:18.477 --> 16:19.717
Let's talk sparkles kin.

16:19.778 --> 16:22.452
Do we know anyone in Product
Development over at Sephora?

16:22.514 --> 16:23.993
Goodbye, Tom.

16:24.350 --> 16:27.092
Here's a picture of me and April
making out in her apartment.

16:27.152 --> 16:30.827
Here's a picture of us
making out in Ben's office.

16:30.889 --> 16:33.267
This is a picture of...
This is us making out...

16:33.325 --> 16:34.861
I don't know where that
is, but you can tell that

16:34.927 --> 16:36.031
she's sucking
on my lip.

16:36.128 --> 16:37.266
(LAUGHS)

16:37.629 --> 16:38.972
Traveling.

16:39.331 --> 16:40.571
Making out...
You okay, boss?

16:40.632 --> 16:42.077
No, not really.

16:42.401 --> 16:44.210
I know I should be focusing
on this river cleanup,

16:44.269 --> 16:45.873
but all I keep
thinking about is Ben

16:45.938 --> 16:48.145
laughing in a helicopter
with Hot Rebecca.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.347
Who's Hot Rebecca?
(SIGHS)

16:50.409 --> 16:52.946
She's just this jealousy
amalgam I created.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.756
I combined all of the
giant, dark-haired

16:56.815 --> 16:58.385
smartphone power
Goddesses

16:58.450 --> 17:00.794
into one woman called Hot Rebecca.
Oh.

17:01.153 --> 17:03.258
I mean, Ben's life
is filled with Senators

17:03.322 --> 17:04.994
and briefings
and Super PACs.

17:05.223 --> 17:08.034
I can't even get a meeting
with some bureaucrat.

17:08.093 --> 17:10.505
(LAUGHS) I don't know what
a bureaucrat is. Yeah.

17:10.561 --> 17:13.667
Everything is going to
be fine with you and Ben

17:13.766 --> 17:18.181
because if I know Ben,
he, too, is an amalgam.

17:18.237 --> 17:19.271
No.
Yeah.

17:19.338 --> 17:22.147
Point is you're better
than Hot Rebecca.

17:22.674 --> 17:23.743
You're Kickass Leslie.

17:24.143 --> 17:26.782
Long distance relationships
are never easy,

17:26.845 --> 17:29.416
but you never,
ever give up on stuff.

17:29.681 --> 17:31.456
(SIGHS) Thanks.

17:31.517 --> 17:32.655
That's what makes you...

17:32.918 --> 17:34.454
Nope.
...an amalgam.

17:34.520 --> 17:35.863
Nailed it.

17:37.356 --> 17:38.767
<i>Ron, award'?</i>

17:39.191 --> 17:40.192
Mmm.

17:40.325 --> 17:42.601
Are you aware of what's going
on out in your department?

17:42.661 --> 17:43.662
I am.

17:43.729 --> 17:46.767
My department is pouting because
I didn't put on a puppet show

17:46.832 --> 17:49.506
based on the funniest
email chain of the year.

17:49.568 --> 17:50.979
I would have liked
to have seen that show.

17:51.036 --> 17:53.312
My nomination was
"Jerry accidentally

17:53.372 --> 17:55.875
"forwards his bank
statement to everyone."

17:55.941 --> 17:58.945
(LAUGHS) Classic.
And depressing.

17:59.011 --> 18:03.255
The point of a barbecue is not
to do hokey office-joke theater.

18:03.782 --> 18:04.954
The point is...

18:05.017 --> 18:07.861
The point of the barbecue was
to thank the department.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.491
It was an Employee
Appreciation barbecue.

18:11.290 --> 18:12.963
Ron, I gave
you the chance

18:13.025 --> 18:15.096
to become Assistant
City Manager,

18:15.160 --> 18:18.300
and you chose to stay
here, which is fine.

18:18.363 --> 18:20.570
But if you're going
to lead the department,

18:20.632 --> 18:23.169
you occasionally have
to lead the department.

18:23.602 --> 18:26.549
And I say that as one of
your closest colleagues

18:26.605 --> 18:27.913
and dearest friends.

18:29.475 --> 18:31.113
But also as your boss.

18:32.744 --> 18:33.745
(DOOR CLOSES)

18:34.313 --> 18:36.623
I went to our nation's
capital this weekend

18:36.682 --> 18:40.630
in order to apply for a federal
grant to clean up our city's river.

18:40.686 --> 18:43.428
But things move pretty
slow in Washington,

18:43.489 --> 18:44.900
and I'm not going
to wait around.

18:45.491 --> 18:47.528
And I was recently
reminded by someone

18:47.593 --> 18:49.334
that I'm not
the type of person

18:49.394 --> 18:51.340
to shy away
from hard work.

18:51.430 --> 18:53.103
(CAMERA CLICKING)

18:53.265 --> 18:55.768
What? Did I... Do you need
something from me right now?

18:55.834 --> 18:57.177
No. No.
Never mind.

18:57.236 --> 19:00.615
Point is I'm going to clean
up this river by myself.

19:01.073 --> 19:04.213
Every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
to 10:00 a.m., I will be here.

19:04.643 --> 19:06.554
Those are my office hours.

19:06.612 --> 19:07.955
If you want to come
and talk to me

19:08.013 --> 19:09.822
or ask me questions
or raise an issue,

19:09.882 --> 19:11.293
this is where I'll be.

19:11.750 --> 19:13.525
Let's get to work,
Pawnee.

19:14.987 --> 19:17.092
Oh, my God. The smell is so much
worse when you get up close.

19:17.589 --> 19:19.728
Yeah. Oh! Look.
A handgun!

19:19.791 --> 19:20.997
I call it!
Holy...

19:21.059 --> 19:22.163
Whoa!

19:23.195 --> 19:25.141
Everyone,
get in here now!

19:28.433 --> 19:30.435
Your work is appreciated.

19:30.502 --> 19:31.879
Eat some corn.

19:31.937 --> 19:33.473
ANN: Thanks, Ron.
Thank you, Ron.

19:33.539 --> 19:34.677
TOM: Thanks, Ron.
Thanks, Ron.

19:34.740 --> 19:36.378
Also, here's Tom.

19:37.009 --> 19:38.386
Ah!

19:40.245 --> 19:42.247
It actually smells
really delicious.

19:42.314 --> 19:43.622
It really does.

19:44.316 --> 19:46.455
Give me some of Tommy's ribs.
JERRY: Oh, heck, yeah.

19:46.518 --> 19:47.690
ANN: Sorry, Tom.

19:47.753 --> 19:49.232
DONNA: Oh, my God.
TOM: That's good.

19:49.655 --> 19:52.864
<i>I mean, if I had known it didn't go
well with the guy from Interior...</i>

19:52.925 --> 19:54.802
No, no, no.
You did nothing wrong.

19:54.860 --> 19:57.534
I am so happy for you, and
how much everyone loves you

19:57.596 --> 19:59.598
and how great you're doing.

19:59.665 --> 20:01.804
I just freaked out.
I'm sorry.

20:01.867 --> 20:02.937
<i>Long distance sucks.</i>

20:03.535 --> 20:05.674
<i>It does.
But we can do this, right?</i>

20:06.538 --> 20:08.176
Yeah, definitely.

20:08.340 --> 20:09.751
Can you come
visit next month?

20:09.808 --> 20:11.617
We can take a proper
tour of the sights.

20:12.477 --> 20:14.582
There's only one sight
I want to see right now.

20:15.113 --> 20:18.788
<i>All right. I mean, this is getting weird.
But, there it is.</i>

20:19.318 --> 20:21.821
<i>I meant the Jefferson
Memorial, you perv!</i>

20:21.887 --> 20:25.733
<i>Right. Sorry. Sorry. I don't...
I'm just...</i>

20:27.059 --> 20:28.231
<i>Wait. No, you didn't.</i>

20:28.293 --> 20:29.772
No, <i>I</i> didn't.

20:29.861 --> 20:31.966
<i>(LAUGHS) Spin it around
and back it on up.</i>

20:32.030 --> 20:33.202
All right.

20:34.600 --> 20:37.547
The White House, America's
most whitest house.

20:37.903 --> 20:41.510
Most notably is where Sinbad
lived in the film, <i>First</i> Kid.

20:41.573 --> 20:42.950
Sinbad. Wow.

20:43.008 --> 20:45.614
The other tour guide never
said anything about that.

20:45.677 --> 20:48.521
Do you know why it's
called the Oval Office?

20:48.580 --> 20:49.991
No.
Because of a man.

20:50.582 --> 20:52.027
Oval Redenbacher.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.563
What?
The popcorn inventor.

20:53.619 --> 20:55.565
He used to hang out
with John F. Kennedy.

20:55.621 --> 20:57.692
Excuse me.
Attention, everyone!

20:57.756 --> 20:59.258
This tour guide
is the most amazing

20:59.324 --> 21:00.826
tour guide
there ever was.

21:00.892 --> 21:02.735
Please. Step up.

21:03.295 --> 21:05.036
$200 cash up front.
