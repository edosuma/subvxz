08:20.396 --> 08:21.673
[RJ] Up, please.

08:21.708 --> 08:24.538
[Emily] Oh, sweetie,
it's only a little bit further.

08:24.573 --> 08:25.781
-Here. Will you take that?
-Yeah.

08:25.815 --> 08:28.473
Okay. Come here.
Come here.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.544
Want a little bit of a...

08:31.096 --> 08:35.722
[Emily grunting]

08:35.756 --> 08:38.690
What have you been eating?
What's in your belly?

08:38.725 --> 08:40.035
-What the fuck, hun?
-[RJ] Food!

08:40.071 --> 08:41.003
Food?

08:41.037 --> 08:42.073
-Honey.
-Yeah.

08:42.936 --> 08:44.282
What?

08:44.316 --> 08:48.148
This is Two-Buck Chuck.
We can't bring this
to the dinner party.

08:48.182 --> 08:49.529
Why?

08:49.563 --> 08:51.427
Why? 'Cause it's two bucks.

08:51.461 --> 08:53.912
It's what we had.
I didn't think it was
gonna make a difference.

08:53.947 --> 08:57.260
This is like what
19-year-olds cook with.

08:57.295 --> 08:59.021
Oh, sweetie.
It's fine.

08:59.055 --> 09:00.125
[Alex sighs]

09:00.160 --> 09:02.369
-It's fine, right?
-It's kind of a lame move.

09:02.403 --> 09:06.235
I... I think what you're doing
right now is kind of
a lame move.

09:09.272 --> 09:10.619
-Hello!
-[Alex] Hey.

09:10.653 --> 09:12.482
Welcome, new friends.
I'm Charlotte.

09:12.517 --> 09:13.725
-[Alex] Hi.
-You must be Alex.

09:13.760 --> 09:15.796
-Come on in. Come on in.
-Okay. Thank you.

09:15.831 --> 09:17.971
I'm just gonna kiss
your cheeks. Mmm.

09:18.005 --> 09:18.834
[Alex] Okay.

09:18.868 --> 09:20.180
-And you must be Emily.
-Yes.

09:20.214 --> 09:22.320
[Charlotte] Beauty! Whoo!
[Emily] Well, thank you.

09:22.354 --> 09:23.597
Thank you for that.

09:23.632 --> 09:25.150
Let that kid down.
We'll have them run free here.

09:25.185 --> 09:26.980
All right. There we go.

09:27.014 --> 09:31.156
Hello, sweet pea.
Do you wanna eat pizza
until your belly explodes?

09:31.191 --> 09:32.537
-Yeah!
-Yeah?

09:32.572 --> 09:35.160
[all laughing]

09:35.195 --> 09:38.439
Oh, I know someone who's been
waiting to play with him
all day long.

09:38.474 --> 09:39.786
-Come on in, please.
-[Alex] Thank you.

09:39.820 --> 09:41.753
-[Alex] Um, here you go.
-[Charlotte sighs]

09:41.788 --> 09:42.892
This is from
a farm up north.

09:42.927 --> 09:44.722
-It's our friend's farm.
-Wow!

09:44.756 --> 09:46.862
Yeah, that's why
there's no label, 'cause
they recycle the bottles.

09:46.896 --> 09:49.899
-Oh. Okay.
-So... It's organic.

09:49.934 --> 09:52.730
Great. Wow.
Well, thank you so much, Alex.

09:52.764 --> 09:54.110
-Great.
-Come on in.

09:54.145 --> 09:56.596
[Charlotte] The boys
are just finishing
their homework.

09:56.630 --> 09:58.080
I'm gonna get you
with my horse!

09:58.114 --> 09:59.702
I'm gonna get you
with my horse!

09:59.737 --> 10:01.635
All right, last one.
Last one.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.776
"Vamos a la biblioteca."

10:04.811 --> 10:06.640
[Max yelling]
Biblioteca!

10:06.675 --> 10:08.435
-Right. Hey.
-[Charlotte] Hey.

10:08.469 --> 10:09.850
Bienvenudos,guys.

10:09.885 --> 10:11.645
[Kurt] Ciao.
[both] Hey.

10:11.680 --> 10:13.164
Kurt is speaking Spanish
with Max

10:13.198 --> 10:16.581
in anticipation for some work
we're gonna be doing in Ecuador.

10:16.616 --> 10:17.755
[Alex] Oh, wow!
That's amazing.

10:17.789 --> 10:19.377
[Charlotte] Mm-hmm. But with me

10:19.411 --> 10:21.759
-it's mostly French.
-Uh-huh.

10:21.793 --> 10:23.105
You... So, you...
French and Spanish?

10:23.139 --> 10:25.625
-Does that ever get
confusing for him?
-No.

10:25.659 --> 10:27.730
-Do the two...
-Keeps him on his toes.

10:27.765 --> 10:31.423
I don't know if you guys
noticed, but we've got
a seriously delicious situation
developing here.

10:31.458 --> 10:32.666
-Oh, yeah.
-Mmm, yum!

10:32.701 --> 10:35.358
-You guys look great.
-Oh, thanks.

10:35.393 --> 10:37.464
Hey, thank you again
for inviting us.

10:37.498 --> 10:38.534
Oh, yeah.

10:38.568 --> 10:39.811
Your house is gorgeous,
by the way.

10:39.846 --> 10:41.641
-[Charlotte] Thank you.
-It's beautiful.

10:41.675 --> 10:46.507
I'm proud to say
that Kurt designed and rebuilt
the entire thing himself.

10:46.542 --> 10:47.681
Well...

10:47.716 --> 10:49.407
It was just an ugly box
when we bought it.

10:49.441 --> 10:51.374
Holy cow!

10:51.409 --> 10:54.032
I actually based the entire
design on Charlotte's childhood
home in the south of France.

10:54.067 --> 10:57.795
Wow. So is that what you do?
You're an architect?

10:58.761 --> 11:00.763
I've... I've lived
many lives, Alex.

11:00.798 --> 11:06.424
I've been born, died
and resurrected so many times,
I can't even tell you, but...

11:06.458 --> 11:08.184
Can I show you
what my passion is now?

11:08.219 --> 11:09.530
[Kurt] I'm really excited
about it.

11:09.565 --> 11:10.670
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

11:10.704 --> 11:11.947
Then we'll do pizza.

11:14.225 --> 11:15.467
[Charlotte chuckles]

11:18.608 --> 11:19.713
Here, drink it.

11:20.956 --> 11:23.855
-[Alex] Yeah?
-Yeah, drink it, taste it.

11:23.890 --> 11:26.306
-How does that taste?
-Oh. It's... It's really good.

11:26.340 --> 11:29.136
Are you familiar with
desalinization through
reverse osmosis?

11:29.827 --> 11:30.966
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.484
-You are.
-[Alex] Um...

11:32.519 --> 11:35.591
Remind me again
what, what it is.

11:35.625 --> 11:38.421
So, that water
that you're drinking
was processed through
a filtering system

11:38.456 --> 11:41.908
that I've been developing
for the past ten years.
My own personal system.

11:41.942 --> 11:44.669
What's wrong with a...
Like a normal filter?

11:44.704 --> 11:48.880
They only last about
36 hours. After that
you're basically drinking
liquid cancer.

11:48.915 --> 11:50.813
[Charlotte] Mmm.
[Kurt] But with my system,

11:50.848 --> 11:55.369
we're essentially taking
spoiled lemons and making
sweet, sweet lemonade.

11:55.404 --> 11:58.269
[Kurt] Like that water that
you're drinking right there,
that was initially sewage.

11:58.303 --> 11:59.270
Pretty amazing, right?

11:59.304 --> 12:00.064
-[Alex] Mmm.
-Oh.

12:00.098 --> 12:02.894
[Kurt] Yeah.
So you see how far...

12:02.929 --> 12:05.310
[Kurt] Oh, no. Oh, no. Alex...
[Charlotte] Oh-oh.

12:05.345 --> 12:08.072
Alex. Alex, it's beyond clean.
I would not give you
disgusting water.

12:08.106 --> 12:09.832
-[Emily] He's just joking.
-I know he's kidding.

12:09.867 --> 12:11.351
No, it's so good.

12:11.385 --> 12:13.284
-[Kurt] Well, thank you.
-It's really good.

12:13.318 --> 12:15.113
We already have our system
set up in some of the poorest
parts of the world.

12:15.148 --> 12:17.875
-Like your Cubas,
your Northern Pakistans...
-Wow.

12:17.909 --> 12:19.704

of Africas.

village to village.

-Oh, my God, just...
-Before you can...

12:24.088 --> 12:26.849
Sometimes the only way
to shut him is to kiss him.

12:26.884 --> 12:28.092
That's not true.
Is that true?

12:28.126 --> 12:30.025
-No, I mean...
-I stop talking.

12:30.059 --> 12:31.751
I'm so proud of you, darling.

12:31.785 --> 12:33.407
-I stop. I stop.
-I'm fucking hungry.

12:33.442 --> 12:34.615
[Kurt] Okay.

12:34.650 --> 12:35.789
Are you hungry?
I'm sure you are.

12:35.824 --> 12:38.343
[Kurt] Are you guys
fucking hungry?

12:38.378 --> 12:39.551
-Sure.
-Yeah.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.454

12:45.488 --> 12:48.112
One more piece of pizza
for old tubby over here.

12:48.146 --> 12:49.596
[Kurt] Oh...

12:49.630 --> 12:51.632
Seriously, buddy, you don't
have to barf to show us
you like the food.

12:51.667 --> 12:53.496
Honey, he might have
a point there.
I don't know.

12:53.531 --> 12:55.636
Jesus, I feel like
I'm on Intervention
or something.

12:55.671 --> 12:58.191

one more piece.
He's a growing boy.

-[Alex] Thank you, Charlotte.
-You're welcome.

13:01.021 --> 13:03.058
[Max] The pizza is yucky.

13:03.092 --> 13:04.818
Doesn't look like
you thought it was yucky.

13:04.853 --> 13:06.820
It's so good,
you know what
it makes me think about?

13:13.862 --> 13:15.484

13:15.518 --> 13:17.969
-Hold on, I just wanna
say one thing.
-He's very funny.

13:18.004 --> 13:19.557
I wanna say one thing.

13:19.591 --> 13:23.354
You know, one of our main
worries coming here was

13:23.388 --> 13:27.461
that we wouldn't be
able to meet new people
or make new friends.

13:27.496 --> 13:29.325
Um...

13:29.360 --> 13:33.226
And I have to say that
tonight you guys really
put that to bed.

13:33.260 --> 13:34.779
-[Alex] And, and, and...
-It's true.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.954
-[Alex] It is true.
-[Emily] It's true.
He's... Yeah.

13:36.988 --> 13:40.992
-And I just wanna say,
thank you for having us
in your beautiful home.
-[Emily] Thank you.

13:41.027 --> 13:43.374
-Glad we could be
of service. Cheers.
-[Emily] So, thank you.

13:44.996 --> 13:47.447
And, you know what,
speaking of being
put to bed.

13:47.481 --> 13:50.691
Yeah, I think
we're hitting the wall
here energy-wise.

13:50.726 --> 13:52.521
-Yeah, it's close.
-Yeah.

13:52.555 --> 13:55.075
-It's gonna be all like
the squirt's rules
from here on out.
-[Emily] Yeah.

13:55.110 --> 13:57.250
RJ, are you ready
to say goodbye to Max?

13:57.284 --> 14:00.529
Only in America do we
let children dictate
when the night is over.

14:00.563 --> 14:04.326
Why don't we put
the kids to bed upstairs
and continue down here?

14:04.360 --> 14:06.259
Carry him home later,
once we're done.

14:06.293 --> 14:07.674
-[Charlotte] Yeah.
-What do you think?

14:07.708 --> 14:08.813

a French house.

14:08.848 --> 14:09.952

-I don't...

Well, we... No, we...
We'll just get out
of your hair.

14:13.093 --> 14:14.957
-We want you to stay.
-[Alex] It's fine.

[RJ] Yes.
[Kurt] Settled then. All right.

14:21.688 --> 14:23.517
I'm not done
with you two yet.

14:23.552 --> 14:24.933
And as for you two kids.

14:24.967 --> 14:28.246
You come with me upstairs
because I have got
a surprise for you.

28:07.306 --> 28:08.790
Ah, no, no, no, no.

28:08.825 --> 28:11.310
This isn't Kurt's bedroom
at all.

28:11.344 --> 28:12.829
No. This is mybedroom.

28:12.863 --> 28:16.384
Oh, I'm sorry.
I just assumed that
you guys were...

28:17.454 --> 28:19.076
It's totally fine, you know.

28:19.111 --> 28:23.080
It, it all started with him
taking too much time
in the bathroom and then

28:23.115 --> 28:26.705
I couldn't sleep with
his breathing noises
but it's,

28:26.739 --> 28:29.328
it's all for the best.
I love it.

28:29.362 --> 28:30.467
-You love it?
-Mmm.

28:30.501 --> 28:33.884
So you sleep in here alone?

28:33.919 --> 28:37.405
This bedroom is mine.
It's only mine.

28:37.439 --> 28:39.131
Mm-hmm.

28:39.165 --> 28:42.513
And there are things that I do
in my bedroom that
no one needs to know about.

28:46.276 --> 28:47.933
You know you've got
a really great look.

28:49.141 --> 28:51.039
-Uh...
-Anybody ever tell you that?

28:51.971 --> 28:53.248
No.

28:53.283 --> 28:55.664
You gotta a really neat thing
going on.

28:55.699 --> 28:57.597
Mind if I snap a couple?

28:57.632 --> 28:58.944
Um...

28:59.979 --> 29:02.154
I think I might
need some direction or...

29:02.188 --> 29:04.466
You don't. Just do
whatever you were
just doing. It was great.

29:05.398 --> 29:06.434
-Really?
-Yeah.

29:07.262 --> 29:08.505
That's great. Relax.

29:08.539 --> 29:10.127
-Like that?
-Yeah.

29:11.404 --> 29:12.509
-Wait.
-Okay. [chuckles]

29:14.545 --> 29:18.342
Your shirt's kind of blending in
with the backdrop.
Would you take it off, please?

29:18.377 --> 29:19.550
-My shirt?
-Yeah

29:21.760 --> 29:23.934
All right.

29:23.969 --> 29:29.146
You know,
I would put money
on my husband just being

29:29.181 --> 29:31.148
passed out on the floor
right now.

29:31.183 --> 29:35.359
He usually has a bit of
trouble keeping it together
when he smokes weed.

29:35.394 --> 29:37.396
Oh, he seemed fine to me.

29:38.811 --> 29:40.226
We'll see.

29:40.261 --> 29:42.297
-One time in college...
-Mm-hmm.

29:42.332 --> 29:46.681
...he thought that he was
breathing out of his ears
and he had a panic attack.

29:46.715 --> 29:48.683
Be careful. Careful.

29:48.717 --> 29:50.029
[Emily] I'm serious.
He did that.

29:50.064 --> 29:51.099
-Like that?
-That's great, yeah.

29:51.134 --> 29:52.756
That feels weird, like...

29:52.791 --> 29:55.103
But you know what,
it's weird in real life,
it's great on camera.

29:55.138 --> 29:56.829
Yeah. You're looking for...

29:56.864 --> 29:58.003
-Hey!
-[Emily exclaiming]

29:58.037 --> 29:59.521
-Oh, hey, guys. Hi.
-[Charlotte] Hey!

29:59.556 --> 30:00.729
-Hey.
-[Charlotte laughs]

30:00.764 --> 30:02.593
-Um, what's up?
-[Emily] See?

30:02.628 --> 30:04.975
-I told you that
he was gonna...
-[Charlotte]
It's okay. Don't worry.

30:05.010 --> 30:06.321
-What's up?
-Hey.

30:06.356 --> 30:07.944
What are you...

30:07.978 --> 30:10.256
-What are you guys...
-What we were doing was
just getting to the good part.

30:10.291 --> 30:13.052
You were getting
to the good part?
What does that mean?

30:13.087 --> 30:14.502
Oh, it's okay.
It's just painting.

30:14.536 --> 30:17.954
Yeah, hun, did you know
that Kurt was a painter?

30:17.988 --> 30:19.748
-No!
-Painted all these
beautiful paintings. Yeah.

30:19.783 --> 30:21.026
I didn't know that.

30:21.060 --> 30:23.407
And, uh, he's a
photographer too, which is...

30:23.442 --> 30:24.857
Why were you on the ground?

30:24.892 --> 30:28.274
There's nothing
to worry about, Emily.
We were just free styling.

30:28.309 --> 30:30.587
-We got into a mood
and just went with it.
-Yeah.

30:31.381 --> 30:32.796
You're ridiculous.

30:32.831 --> 30:33.935
Hey.

30:33.970 --> 30:35.454
I've got a proposal to make.

30:37.490 --> 30:40.010
My proposal's this.

30:40.045 --> 30:44.394
That swimming pool out there
has about 10,000 gallons
of the freshest
filtered water imaginable.

30:44.428 --> 30:47.293
You can drink it.
It's got healing powers.

30:47.328 --> 30:51.642
Now I think we all
need to get in that pool
and let the fucking
healing begin.

30:51.677 --> 30:54.473
-I mean, who's with me?
What do you guys think?
-I am with you.

30:54.507 --> 30:57.441
-Come on!
-[Charlotte] Come on, guys!
Let's go!

30:57.476 --> 30:58.857
-Come on.
-Okay.

30:59.443 --> 31:00.479
[Alex] Hey!

31:07.900 --> 31:09.626
[Alex] Whoa!

31:14.320 --> 31:15.735

31:15.770 --> 31:16.944
Come on, you guys.

31:16.978 --> 31:18.290
-[Emily] Normally, we would...
-[Alex] Yeah.

31:18.324 --> 31:19.808
We forgot to bring
our suits with us.

31:19.843 --> 31:21.603
No suits in the house, au naturel.

31:24.020 --> 31:25.262
-Oh, my...
-[splash]

31:25.297 --> 31:27.230
-Okay.
-[Kurt] Feels so good.

31:27.264 --> 31:30.095
You've got good form
on that, um...

31:30.129 --> 31:31.855
[Emily whispering]
[Alex chuckles]

31:31.890 --> 31:33.374
I don't know.

31:33.408 --> 31:35.272
-There's nothing to discuss.
House rules.
-[Alex] Um...

31:35.307 --> 31:37.826
All right, we'll probably
come in. We, we
just need to, like...

31:37.861 --> 31:39.069
-[Emily whispers] Take a minute.
-Um...

31:39.104 --> 31:40.519
Just... We just need
to take a minute.

31:40.553 --> 31:43.280
We're gonna have
a conversation, super quick.

31:43.315 --> 31:45.282
[whispering]
Okay, look. Listen,

31:45.317 --> 31:47.836
I'm like super fucked up
right now.

31:47.871 --> 31:48.941
I know.

31:48.976 --> 31:50.356
-Are you fucked up?
-Yeah.

31:50.391 --> 31:52.082
-[Kurt] Come in here.
-[Alex sighs]

31:52.117 --> 31:55.672
I... I need
to talk to you about
something serious.

31:55.706 --> 31:58.019
What? What's going on?

31:58.054 --> 32:00.435
I can't go skinny dipping
with them.

32:00.470 --> 32:03.197
Why? I think it'll be
very exciting,

32:03.231 --> 32:06.614
to be in the water with
Charlotte's ta-tas.

32:06.648 --> 32:08.512
That's not what
I'm talking about
and you know it.

32:10.514 --> 32:13.828
I... You know, I can't...
You know what...
You know what
I'm talking about.

32:13.862 --> 32:15.485
Oh, oh-oh-oh.

32:15.519 --> 32:16.658
-Well...
-Honey.

32:20.214 --> 32:23.251
How many times
do I have to reassure
you about that?

32:25.564 --> 32:27.428
[Kurt] Come on, guys.

32:27.462 --> 32:29.257
[Kurt] This isn't
the G8 Summit.

32:29.292 --> 32:30.845
[Alex sighs]

32:30.879 --> 32:34.745
It wouldn't be so bad
if we just have to see
his giant goddamn
horse cock.

32:34.780 --> 32:36.195
-You know?
-It's pretty big.

32:36.851 --> 32:39.026
It's really, really big.

32:39.060 --> 32:40.337
[Kurt and Charlotte laughing]

32:40.372 --> 32:41.407
-Listen.
-Okay.

32:41.442 --> 32:45.239
Listen,
if you're uncomfortable,

32:45.273 --> 32:49.415
I will absolutely
follow your lead.

32:49.450 --> 32:51.107
Okay.

32:51.141 --> 32:53.695
You don't have to do
anything you don't want to.

32:53.730 --> 32:55.249
Well, I'm not going to.

32:56.181 --> 32:58.735
So, we talked
and, um...

32:58.769 --> 33:02.635
We don't wanna disrespect
your house rules, but...

33:02.670 --> 33:03.947
We are not French.

33:03.982 --> 33:05.880
[Emily] No.
[Alex] So we've never
done this before...

33:05.914 --> 33:09.573
[Emily] Ever.
[Alex] And we, we're just
hoping that underwear is...

33:09.608 --> 33:11.334
Because that's as good
as we can...

33:11.368 --> 33:14.613
Yeah. So we hope,
we hope that that's
okay with you guys.

33:15.614 --> 33:18.341
Absolutely, as long as
it's negotiable.

died in the pool.

judgment going on.

No. It's just, uh...

It's my problem.

a problem.

Honey, you don't have
to cover for me.

it's just that we're not
totally comfortable.

It's not her problem.
Okay. It's...

36:57.042 --> 36:59.734
-You don't have to do this.
-No, it's me.
I have a body issue.

-Why wouldn't I do this?

-What?

we are?

-I do know that, too.
-And I'm in with these
wonderful people.

I have a body issue?

You just say the words,
you know?

37:22.101 --> 37:23.724
-What's the issue?
-Yeah.

small dick.

-I have an abnormally
small dick!

All right.
Did you get the stuff?

51:13.967 --> 51:16.107
-Yeah, I did.
-Let's see.

51:16.142 --> 51:18.903
-Hey.
-Hi.

51:18.937 --> 51:20.387
-Hey, honey.
-Hey.

51:21.250 --> 51:23.114
-Honey. Honey.
-What?

51:23.149 --> 51:26.738
-There's some seriously
weird shit just
went down out there.
-What now?

51:26.773 --> 51:28.878
What do you...
What do you mean,
"What now?"

51:28.913 --> 51:33.124
I mean, you think
everything's weird tonight.
So, what now?

51:33.159 --> 51:36.610
-I don't think everything's
weird tonight.
-You know what?

51:36.645 --> 51:38.819
-You brought me to
California, okay?
-Uh-huh.

51:38.854 --> 51:41.960
So I'm trying to make
the best of it and you're
just shitting all over it.

51:41.995 --> 51:43.272
-Alex.
-What?

51:43.307 --> 51:45.274
Alex, you're really being
kind of a dick right now.

51:45.309 --> 51:47.207
-I'm trying...
-[RJ moaning]

51:47.242 --> 51:48.657
[RJ] Daddy, Mama!

51:48.691 --> 51:50.590
You know what?
Don't worry about it.
I'll get it.

51:50.624 --> 51:52.764
-Okay.
-[Alex] Daddy will get that.

51:52.799 --> 51:54.145
[Kurt]You sure?
[Alex]Yeah.

51:54.180 --> 51:56.251
[Kurt] All right. You go boy!

51:56.285 --> 52:00.358
Hey, if it's Max who's crying
and he doesn't remember you,
just remind him who you are.

52:00.393 --> 52:03.189
Emily, can I get
you a stiff one?

52:05.950 --> 52:07.124
Please.

52:29.801 --> 52:31.320
Oh, my God!

52:31.355 --> 52:32.770
Is everything okay?

52:32.804 --> 52:36.222
Yeah. Yes.
It's fine.

52:36.256 --> 52:38.155
Can I talk to you?

52:38.189 --> 52:40.502
Mm-hmm. Of course.

52:41.192 --> 52:42.711
Come and sit on my bed.

52:44.851 --> 52:46.715
Yeah, yeah, okay.

52:46.749 --> 52:48.026
Okay.

52:48.061 --> 52:49.166
Right now?

52:49.856 --> 52:51.306
Huh.

52:51.340 --> 52:54.101
This is, uh...
You got a couch and a...

52:54.136 --> 52:57.829
Like a love seat type thing,
I think that's...
It must be handy...

52:59.555 --> 53:00.901
Yeah, yeah.

53:00.936 --> 53:05.596
You know, depending
on what mood
you're in, I guess, for...

53:05.630 --> 53:10.117
For reading a novel
or something, I would
imagine it's really cozy.

53:10.152 --> 53:12.361
Yeah, and you're wearing
the perfect outfit.

53:12.396 --> 53:14.121
-This cozy robe.
-[Charlotte laughs]

53:14.156 --> 53:16.054
That's right.

53:16.089 --> 53:18.850
And these ones here,
they just came to me
in a dream one night.

53:18.885 --> 53:20.783
What happened was like,
I woke up one morning

53:20.818 --> 53:24.546
-and bam, a voice fucking
yelling in my ears.
-Kurt...

53:27.928 --> 53:31.622
-Yes, ma'am?
-I don't wanna talk about
your paintings any more.

53:31.656 --> 53:34.452
-What do you wanna talk about?
-I wanna talk about you.

53:34.487 --> 53:36.627
And I wanna talk
about your wife.

53:36.661 --> 53:39.837
And I wanna talk about
what is going on here.

53:39.871 --> 53:40.769
Okay.

53:42.598 --> 53:43.703
What do you do?

53:43.737 --> 53:47.879
You are a salesman
of water filters?

53:47.914 --> 53:50.641
And you can somehow
afford this house doing that?

53:50.675 --> 53:53.816
Or do you make all this money
selling these paintings?

53:53.851 --> 53:57.648
Which, Kurt, I've gotta say,
what are they?

53:57.682 --> 53:59.270
Are they supposed to be
close-ups of assholes or what?

53:59.305 --> 54:01.859
That's so funny.
Both you and your husband
got that immediately.

54:01.893 --> 54:02.963
Huh.

54:02.998 --> 54:05.690
I feel like I need to clear
some things up for you.

54:05.725 --> 54:10.039
Yes. Please do.
Clarity sounds
just great to me.

54:10.074 --> 54:13.077
In some places,
Nordic places,

54:13.111 --> 54:16.563
where the winters
are cold and long
and it gets dark early,

54:17.530 --> 54:19.566
people like to
masturbate to this.

54:20.464 --> 54:22.880
And not only this,

54:22.914 --> 54:26.849
but lots of the titles
that we have available
on our Mommy's Milkseries.

54:34.961 --> 54:38.792
[Kurt and Charlotte
speaking foreign language]

54:38.827 --> 54:44.315
I'm here to present you
the new Breast
Pumpadella 2000.

54:44.350 --> 54:49.286
You know, I can see
in Kurt's eyes
that he really enjoys
both of you.

54:50.114 --> 54:51.805
Especially you.

54:51.840 --> 54:52.979
-Yeah?
-Mm.

54:54.532 --> 54:56.534
I think you're gonna
be his new buddy.

54:56.569 --> 54:59.468
-That's great. Thank you.
-Yeah.

54:59.503 --> 55:02.022
Emily and I are gonna
be buddies too.

55:02.057 --> 55:03.369
Don't you think so?

55:03.403 --> 55:06.579
Yeah.
I mean, I hope so.

55:06.613 --> 55:09.789
I'm sorry if she's like...

55:09.823 --> 55:12.343
-Like tight or something.
-Mm-hmm.

55:12.378 --> 55:14.311
-Do you know what I mean?
-Yes, a little bit.

55:14.345 --> 55:15.622
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

55:15.657 --> 55:19.488
I mean, I've been
encouraging her to loosen up.

55:19.523 --> 55:20.800
Yeah.

55:20.834 --> 55:22.905
-But there's only so much
you can do, you know.
-Yeah.

55:22.940 --> 55:25.701
-Yeah, I can totally
understand that.
-Yeah.

55:25.736 --> 55:26.771
Yeah.

55:27.600 --> 55:29.153
-But, uh...
-[sighs]

55:29.187 --> 55:31.258
Yeah, 'cause
I really like her.

55:31.293 --> 55:32.329
Oh, cool!

55:33.882 --> 55:34.952
That's great.

55:37.575 --> 55:41.545
-I really like her.
-Cool, cool, cool. Yeah. Yeah.

55:43.547 --> 55:44.962
-Well...
-And I like you too, Alex.

55:44.996 --> 55:46.550
Yeah. Thanks.

55:48.103 --> 55:50.105
-Do you like me?
-Yeah.

55:51.520 --> 55:53.591
Yeah. I mean, you know...

55:55.006 --> 55:56.698
[both laugh]

55:58.527 --> 56:00.840
-Do you find me attractive?
-Yeah.

56:00.874 --> 56:02.359
-Yeah?
-Sure, yeah.

56:02.393 --> 56:04.775
-Really?
-Yeah.

56:04.809 --> 56:08.986
Of course. I mean,
you're very attractive.

56:10.470 --> 56:13.059
Do you think that, um,

56:13.093 --> 56:17.408
if we weren't already married,
that I could be someone, uh,

56:17.443 --> 56:19.099
with whom you'd wanna have sex?

56:21.999 --> 56:23.345
[laughs]

56:23.380 --> 56:26.141
Uh, well...

56:27.694 --> 56:28.730
Yes.

56:31.940 --> 56:33.390
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm?

56:34.598 --> 56:38.947
But, you know,
we can't, so...

56:39.844 --> 56:40.914
Mm.

56:43.676 --> 56:47.818
The milk is then filtered
from the breast shield

56:48.439 --> 56:50.855
into the retainer.

56:50.890 --> 56:53.893
What we have produced,
so beautiful.

56:56.240 --> 56:58.276
Nurturing milk

56:58.311 --> 57:01.245
for the little baby to enjoy.

57:01.279 --> 57:03.420
[Emily] Kurt...
[Kurt] Ah, Sun Tzu.

57:03.454 --> 57:05.836
This is pretty fucked up.

57:05.870 --> 57:11.048
Come on, Emily.
The internet's a vast sea
of depravity. You know that.

57:11.082 --> 57:14.741
What we're producing
simply fulfills a niche
without anybody getting hurt.

57:14.776 --> 57:17.813
-No harm, no foul...
-So you're telling me

57:17.848 --> 57:23.716
that there are hundreds
of strange Nordic men
masturbating

57:23.750 --> 57:26.166
to your wife and
you have no problem
with that?

57:26.926 --> 57:27.927
No, I don't.

57:30.343 --> 57:34.727
And Charlotte has
no problem with that?

57:34.761 --> 57:37.868
Something tells me you would
know that Charlotte doesn't
have a problem with that.

57:41.527 --> 57:43.149
We're buddies.

57:43.183 --> 57:46.393
-Yeah, yeah. We're buddies.
-So, we can't...

57:46.428 --> 57:48.223
-We're buddies. [laughs]
-Yeah.

57:48.257 --> 57:50.501
-We're buddies.
-We're buddies.

57:56.265 --> 57:58.060
Whoo!

57:58.095 --> 58:02.651
-You are tense, sweetheart.
You're really tense.
-I know, I-I...

58:02.686 --> 58:04.722
-I thought we
wanted to loosen up.
-Sorry.

58:04.757 --> 58:06.690
Yeah, no, I do,
I want to loosen up,

58:06.724 --> 58:09.934
but I guess I'm just wondering
what loosen up means

58:10.556 --> 58:12.074
at this point.

58:12.834 --> 58:14.663
It's just a friends' kiss.

58:14.698 --> 58:17.321
-It's just a friends' kiss?
-Mm-hmm.

58:17.355 --> 58:18.460
It's just a friends' kiss.

58:18.495 --> 58:20.324
-It's just a friends' kiss.
-Yeah.

58:20.358 --> 58:21.946
[distant music playing]

58:21.981 --> 58:24.708
Hello? Guys?

58:25.536 --> 58:26.744
Alex?

58:29.885 --> 58:31.853
-Honey?
-Guys?

58:33.199 --> 58:34.718
Alex?

58:34.752 --> 58:37.134
[Alex] Oh! That's the spot.

58:37.168 --> 58:39.999
-What did that
sound like to you?
-Don't know.

58:40.482 --> 58:41.932
[Alex moans]

58:43.140 --> 58:45.004
[music intensifies]

58:45.038 --> 58:47.040
-[Kurt] Oh, there they are.
-Oh, hey, honey!

58:51.528 --> 58:55.462
I just want to say,
I think you're right.
I think there is something
weird going on here.

58:55.497 --> 59:00.433
Oh, yeah, no shit.
I have seen that woman
give massages before.

59:00.467 --> 59:02.435
What?

59:02.469 --> 59:07.854
Alex, she gave some random guy
a fucking hand job
at the massage parlor.

59:07.889 --> 59:11.099
You guys went to
a massage parlor?
When did you do that?

59:11.133 --> 59:12.307
I can't even... Just...

59:14.102 --> 59:15.966
Were you gonna let her
touch you down there?

59:16.000 --> 59:18.934
Honey! Absolutely not.
I was just saying that
I think you're right.

59:18.969 --> 59:21.247
I think they do wanna,
like, swing with us
or something,

59:21.281 --> 59:23.939
and that is
pretty crazy.

59:23.974 --> 59:26.735
Well, lucky you. See?
You got your expansion
now, right?

59:26.770 --> 59:29.220
-This is what you wanted
all night!
-That's not what I meant
by expansion.

59:29.255 --> 59:31.498
I was talking about
getting crazy with friends

59:31.533 --> 59:33.535
and meeting new people
and having fun

59:33.570 --> 59:35.606
and maybe getting drunk
or whatever.

59:35.641 --> 59:37.815
I didn't mean, like,
fucking-other-people expansion.

59:38.816 --> 59:40.300
That's not what I...

59:40.335 --> 59:42.371
But you can't tell me you
wouldn't have liked it, okay?

59:42.406 --> 59:45.409
-I can't... I mean,
that's irrelevant.
-I don't think it is.

59:45.443 --> 59:47.411
-Yes, it is.
-I don't think that
that's irrelevant at all.

59:47.445 --> 59:50.000
-Why not?
-Stop! Let's just be brutally
honest here for a second.

59:50.034 --> 59:51.415
-Okay.
-Okay?

59:51.449 --> 59:56.109
Ooh! What would have
happened if she had
grabbed for your cock

59:57.870 --> 01:00:00.666
and I hadn't of
been there, huh?

01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:02.391
I wouldn't have allowed it.

01:00:02.426 --> 01:00:04.877
Because you wouldn't have
liked it if she had done it?

01:00:04.911 --> 01:00:08.259
Because I'm married to you,
I wouldn't have allowed it.
It's simple, so...

01:00:08.294 --> 01:00:10.192
Oh, my God,
isn't that
the perfect answer?

01:00:10.227 --> 01:00:12.505
Well, I don't know,
maybe it is the perfect answer.

01:00:12.539 --> 01:00:17.406
That tells me, that tells me...
What you just said tells me
that the desire is still there.

01:00:17.441 --> 01:00:22.377
That tells me that a part of you
thinks about what it would
be like to be with other women.

01:00:22.411 --> 01:00:24.241
Come on!
I mean... Honey...

01:00:24.275 --> 01:00:29.487
Oh, my God!
Not that I think you
would act on it.
I mean, I trust you, I do,

01:00:29.522 --> 01:00:31.869
I really do.
I really...

01:00:31.904 --> 01:00:34.389
I really trust you,
but I think it just...

01:00:34.423 --> 01:00:40.222
It bothers me so much
that that curiosity is there
and it may never go away.

01:00:40.257 --> 01:00:44.054
It just might always live...
live there.

01:00:44.088 --> 01:00:46.677
Curi... I never said
I was curious.

01:00:49.059 --> 01:00:51.095
Honey, I never said
I was curious.

01:00:54.651 --> 01:00:56.445
Oh, wait a second.

01:00:58.378 --> 01:00:59.690
-I'm really tired.
-Oh!

01:00:59.725 --> 01:01:01.416
-I'm feeling really tired.
-Oh! No, no, no.

01:01:01.450 --> 01:01:03.142
-Let's just get out...
This is not the time for...
-No, no, no...

01:01:03.176 --> 01:01:05.385
This is actually
about you, isn't it?

01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:07.871
-Honey, let's just
get out of here.
-This is about you.

01:01:07.905 --> 01:01:12.185
This isn't about me,
this is about you.
You've been putting it
all on me all night.

01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:14.291
-What?
-You're the one

01:01:14.325 --> 01:01:16.983
that's been thinking
about this, isn't it?

01:01:17.018 --> 01:01:21.781
The moment he whipped that
thing out, you haven't been
able to stop thinking about it.

01:01:21.816 --> 01:01:24.681
-You're curious...
-Maybe I am curious, okay?

01:01:24.715 --> 01:01:26.717
-Oh, really? Really?
-Maybe I am.

01:01:26.752 --> 01:01:29.133
I feel that it's weird

01:01:29.168 --> 01:01:31.377
that we have to jerk off
next to each other come.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:40.420
And I really think that
it sucks that you lust
after another woman's breasts

01:01:40.455 --> 01:01:44.839
This is a real thing
and I don't think
that we can deny it.

01:01:44.873 --> 01:01:48.566
I think that you think
about other women

01:01:48.601 --> 01:01:53.295
and I think about
other men.

01:01:59.681 --> 01:02:01.096
-[Kurt] Alex?
-Do you wanna fuck my wife?

01:02:01.131 --> 01:02:03.754
-Stop it, Alex!
-I'm not gonna stop it.
I want to know.

01:02:03.789 --> 01:02:05.100
Do you wanna fuck my wife?

01:02:05.135 --> 01:02:07.137
Because I'm telling you,
she wants to fuck you.

01:02:07.171 --> 01:02:08.759
-Oh!
-She does.

01:02:08.794 --> 01:02:11.693
-I think you're a
little off-base here, Alex.
-You think I'm off-base?

01:02:11.728 --> 01:02:13.315
-Are you serious?
-[Kurt] Yeah.

01:02:13.350 --> 01:02:14.489
Kurt!

01:02:14.523 --> 01:02:17.664
Tell me, why did you show us
your dick down at the pool?

01:02:17.699 --> 01:02:19.321
-Okay.
-Your giant cock!

01:02:19.356 --> 01:02:23.153
Why did you show that to us?
Why did you show my wife
your big dick?

01:02:23.187 --> 01:02:27.813
And then why did you have
me stand next to you
with my tiny dick?

01:02:27.847 --> 01:02:30.263
[Alex] Do you think
I'm an idiot?

01:02:30.298 --> 01:02:33.750
And what? What does this mean?
I get Charlotte now?
So me and Charlotte?

01:02:33.784 --> 01:02:35.510
-Is that cool?
-[Emily] Alex! No!

01:02:35.544 --> 01:02:39.134
Is that why you showed
us that weird video of you
showing your tits to us?

01:02:39.169 --> 01:02:41.792
-We like you both very much.
-Is that what this is?

01:02:41.827 --> 01:02:44.105
But we didn't want
this to be weird.

01:02:44.139 --> 01:02:46.555
Oh, you didn't want
it to be weird.

01:02:46.590 --> 01:02:48.385
-[Charlotte] No.
-Oh, okay.

01:02:48.419 --> 01:02:53.839
My mistake because,
you're right, this isn't weird.
This is fine, so...

01:02:53.873 --> 01:02:57.566
Now that it's not weird,
honey, why don't you lay down?
You have to take
your clothes off.

01:02:57.601 --> 01:03:00.397
-What do you want? Missionary?
Let's do it right here. Kurt?
-You know...

01:03:00.431 --> 01:03:03.745
Why don't you get out
your big old cock and
just shove it right in her?

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:05.367
-That's enough.
-How about that?

01:03:05.402 --> 01:03:07.335
-That's enough.
-You don't have to do circles
anymore, hun,

01:03:07.369 --> 01:03:09.751
-because it's big.
We've all seen it.
-He doesn't want her, Alex!

01:03:09.786 --> 01:03:11.097
He wants you!

01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:17.483
What?

01:03:17.932 --> 01:03:19.381
He wants you.

01:03:21.763 --> 01:03:23.730
Oh!

01:03:23.765 --> 01:03:28.494
We still love each other very,
very much, but we've been
together for a long time and

01:03:29.633 --> 01:03:31.669
things have changed.

01:03:31.704 --> 01:03:37.572
I don't know why, but, you know,
step by step, Kurt's desire
for me just disappeared and, uh,

01:03:37.606 --> 01:03:41.024
he seemed to want something
that I-I couldn't give him.

01:03:41.058 --> 01:03:47.616
When he saw you this morning
at the playground,
he saw sweetness
on your faces and

01:03:47.651 --> 01:03:49.998
he thought that maybe
this could be the solution.

01:03:50.792 --> 01:03:52.173
For both of us.

01:03:56.729 --> 01:03:59.214
Isn't there like a web community
for something like this?

01:03:59.249 --> 01:04:01.044
No, we've never
done this before.

01:04:01.078 --> 01:04:02.597
-Could have fooled us.
-Yeah.

01:04:02.631 --> 01:04:05.289
Then you think
that we're doing a
smooth job of this?

01:04:05.324 --> 01:04:06.981
Does it look like we
do this all the time?

01:04:07.533 --> 01:04:08.672
-Yeah.
-Kind of.

01:04:08.706 --> 01:04:09.984
[Charlotte] It's our first time.

01:04:10.985 --> 01:04:12.952
It's just a total mistake.

01:04:19.407 --> 01:04:22.306
It just doesn't
make any sense.

01:04:22.341 --> 01:04:27.346
It's obvious that
you love each other so much.

01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:28.554
Yeah.

01:04:28.588 --> 01:04:32.144
She's my best friend.
We just don't have a love life.

01:04:32.178 --> 01:04:34.698
-Yeah.
-We stay together
for everything else.

01:04:34.732 --> 01:04:38.253
Max, the house,
the water filter company.

01:04:41.049 --> 01:04:43.880
I'm sorry, I feel like a dick.

01:04:43.914 --> 01:04:45.916
-Why do you feel like a dick?
-Well...

01:04:45.951 --> 01:04:50.438
You're not a dick.
You're not, you know,
you just didn't know.

01:04:50.472 --> 01:04:52.509
You got excited.

01:04:52.543 --> 01:04:56.271
And I wasn't putting my dick
next to your dick to, like,
do anything, I was just dancing
with you, man.

01:04:57.410 --> 01:04:59.240
All right, thanks.

01:04:59.274 --> 01:05:02.933
Think about this.
Less than 24 hours ago,

01:05:02.968 --> 01:05:05.591
we were a park together
as complete strangers.

01:05:05.625 --> 01:05:07.524
-That's true.
-It is.

01:05:07.558 --> 01:05:09.353
Now we're here
and you're in one of my robes.

01:05:12.736 --> 01:05:15.187
-You have so many
robes, by the way.
-[Kurt] I know.

01:05:15.221 --> 01:05:17.085
-We got them in bulk.
-There's enough for all of us.

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:18.845
-How many did you buy?
-12.

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:21.434
-12 robes?
-I got a 12-pack of robes.

Hey, Charlotte. Tell us how...
How did you lose your virginity?

01:05:35.828 --> 01:05:40.522
I feel like you would have been
like on an island
in southern France

01:05:40.557 --> 01:05:45.562
with a pencil thin mustachioed
aristocrat or something.

01:05:45.596 --> 01:05:48.116
Look at you,
Why do you stereotype so much?

01:05:48.151 --> 01:05:49.876
Because I'm racist.

01:05:49.911 --> 01:05:53.984
[laughing] Exactly.
Well, you're not that far,
but it was a farm boy.

01:05:54.019 --> 01:05:55.675
On an island
in southern France?

01:05:55.710 --> 01:05:58.023
-On an island,
in the south of France.
-Are you serious?

01:05:58.057 --> 01:05:59.507
-Yeah...
-So I totally got it right.

01:05:59.541 --> 01:06:02.786
What about you, Emily?
How did you lose your virginity?

01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:04.167
Um...

uh, person...

Person I ever slept with.

01:06:12.485 --> 01:06:14.073
He was your farm boy.

01:06:14.108 --> 01:06:15.592
-I'm your farm boy.
-He was my farm boy.

01:06:15.626 --> 01:06:18.767
-I am a farm boy.
-He still is my farm boy.

01:06:18.802 --> 01:06:22.219
-Are you my... You're my,

-Mm-hmm.

01:06:22.254 --> 01:06:25.222
He'll always be me farm boy.

I've never been to Thailand.

01:06:30.434 --> 01:06:32.540
-I've gone.

beautiful beaches.

Did you guys ever see that movie The Beach
with Leonardo...

01:06:35.577 --> 01:06:38.546
-I love that movie...
-Oh, that makes me not
wanna go to Thailand.

-Yeah, they did.

01:06:41.859 --> 01:06:44.586

-Can I say something
that is so weird?

Can I just say something,
and not to keep bringing up,
like kicking a dead horse here?

-[Alex] Yeah.
-But...

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:54.631

came from watching
the movie The Beach.

What?

01:06:56.115 --> 01:06:59.153

drink water like we can?"

-That movie?

01:07:02.432 --> 01:07:04.261
And I just brought
that movie up?

01:07:04.296 --> 01:07:06.091
-Too weird.
-That's so crazy.

01:07:06.125 --> 01:07:08.196
-Guys, I think this night
was sort of meant to be.
-[Alex] That's like...

01:07:08.231 --> 01:07:11.613
-[Emily] There's a lot
of synchronicity.
-Our stars right now
are a constellation.

-Yes.

01:13:04.863 --> 01:13:09.454
Really. Thank you,
you walked us down the aisle
to this moment.

01:13:09.488 --> 01:13:12.180
-It was a crazy experience.
-Uh-huh.

01:13:12.215 --> 01:13:14.493
-But it was, you know...
-Yeah.

01:13:14.528 --> 01:13:16.771
-It was valuable.
-Yes.

01:13:16.806 --> 01:13:17.841
Yeah.

01:13:19.774 --> 01:13:21.949
-It's good to see you guys.
-Thank you, you too.

01:13:21.983 --> 01:13:24.848
-Yeah.
-Yeah, you've changed
something in your face.

01:13:24.883 --> 01:13:27.541
-You know,
it wasn't very California.
-[Kurt] Yeah.

01:13:27.575 --> 01:13:30.958
-After a while, I was like,
I don't see anyone
else doing this.
-[Kurt] Right.

01:13:30.992 --> 01:13:34.064
-Maybe I should stop, so...
-[Kurt] Right.

01:13:34.099 --> 01:13:37.482
You know, I was planning
on calling you guys.
I, you know...

01:13:37.516 --> 01:13:39.829
I was thinking about that.
I just wasn't quite

01:13:40.485 --> 01:13:42.625
sure what to say.

01:13:43.867 --> 01:13:46.629
-So...
-Don't worry about it.

01:13:46.663 --> 01:13:48.009
We should grab dinner
or something.

01:13:48.044 --> 01:13:49.010
-Totally.
-You know?

01:13:49.045 --> 01:13:50.771
Yeah, we should, maybe
at your house this time.

01:13:50.805 --> 01:13:53.152
Yeah, you could come,
or we could go to a
restaurant this time?

01:13:53.187 --> 01:13:55.465
-[Emily] We found
some great places.
-Totally. Yeah.

01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:58.226
Looks like the boys
have kind of picked up
where they last left off.

01:13:58.261 --> 01:13:59.573
[Charlotte] Yes.

01:13:59.607 --> 01:14:00.988
[Kurt] Gettin' dirty.
[Charlotte] Shall we say hi?

01:14:01.022 --> 01:14:02.058
Let's go say hi.

01:14:02.092 --> 01:14:04.129
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

01:14:04.163 --> 01:14:05.095
[Kurt] So, uh...

01:14:06.511 --> 01:14:08.823
[Kurt] Sold all my art.
[Alex] All of it?

01:14:08.858 --> 01:14:11.550
[Kurt] Yep.
[Alex] Who bought that?

01:14:11.585 --> 01:14:13.103
[Kurt] My wife.
