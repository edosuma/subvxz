>>> THERE ARE A LOT OF PARENTS
WHOSE CHILDREN ARE HEALTHY AND

00:03.714 --> 00:08.954
HAPPY NOW.
WHO LIVE IN FEAR.

00:09.054 --> 00:12.625
>> IT IS -- I CANNOT BE
APPEASED.

00:12.725 --> 00:16.330
>> PANIC BEGINS FOLLOWED BY THE
RITUAL OF CLOSED SCHOOLS.

00:16.430 --> 00:25.907
PARKS AND OTHER PUBLIC --

00:26.007 --> 00:31.347
>> ONE OF THE GREATEST TRIUMPHS
IN MEDICAL HISTORY IS ACHIEVED.

00:31.447 --> 00:35.485
>> THE VACCINE COULD BE
CONSIDERED TO HAVE BEEN 60 TO

00:35.586 --> 00:38.189
80% EFFECTIVE AGAINST POLIO.

00:38.289 --> 00:42.227
>> FULL-SCALE MANUFACTURERS
LABORATORIES HAVE TURNED OUT

00:42.327 --> 00:49.035
ENOUGH OF THE PRECIOUS SERUM FOR
45 MILLION CHILDREN.

00:49.135 --> 00:57.144
>> IF YOU'RE AFRAID FOR YOUR
SHOT TODAY --

00:57.245 --> 00:59.581
>> YOU'RE NOW INOCULATED.
ISN'T THAT GREAT?

00:59.681 --> 01:03.886
>> THE VICTORY GROWS GRANDER AS
HUNDREDS OF THOUSNDS OF

01:03.986 --> 01:08.291
CHILDREN AND ADULTS ARE AT LAST
PROTECTED AGAINST THE CRIPPLING

01:08.391 --> 01:08.925
DISEASE.

01:09.592 --> 01:11.362
>> WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS
BEFORE BUT NOT AT THIS LEVEL.

01:11.462 --> 01:16.568
THIS IS THE MOST COMPLICATED
VACCINATION CAMPAIGN THAT WE'VE

01:16.668 --> 01:19.104
PROBABLY FACED IN OUR COUNTRY IN
DECADES, IF NOT A WHOLE CENTURY.

01:19.204 --> 01:22.975
>> WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING
POSSIBLE TO VACCINATE PEOPLE AND

01:23.075 --> 01:25.711
GIVE THEM IMMUNITY NOW.

01:25.811 --> 01:29.016
>> OFFICIALS SAY THE COUNTRY IS
STILL STRUGGLING WITH ITS

01:29.116 --> 01:33.454
VACCINE ROLLOUT.
AS A NEW CDC ANNOUNCED, THE U.S.

01:33.554 --> 01:37.660
GOVERNMENT DOES NOT EVEN KNOW
HOW MUCH CORONAVIRUS VACCINE THE

01:37.760 --> 01:40.162
COUNTRY HAS AT THIS MOMENT.

01:40.262 --> 01:43.733
>> ONLY ABOUT HALF OF THE TOTAL
NUMBER OF VACCINES THAT HAVE

01:43.833 --> 01:47.370
BEEN DISTRIBUTED HAVE MADE IT
INTO PEOPLE'S ARMS.

01:47.470 --> 01:50.942
>> WE SPENT HOURS, TWO OR THREE
HOURS AT TIME, OFTEN WITH NO

01:51.042 --> 01:51.475
LUCK.

01:52.209 --> 01:56.949
>> SOME PLACES DEMAND AND
FRANKLY OTHER PLACES SUPPLY

01:57.049 --> 01:57.950
OUTSTRIPPED DEMAND.

01:58.383 --> 02:04.991
>> PLENTY OF FOLKS ARE SKEPTICAL
AND DON'T WANT TO GET THE SHOT.

02:05.092 --> 02:06.160
>> NEW DATA SUGGESTING A NEW
STRAIN COULD BE DEADLIER.

02:06.260 --> 02:08.796
>> THE BIDEN PRESIDENCY HINGES
ON THE SUCCESS AGAINST THE

02:08.896 --> 02:09.463
PANDEMIC.

02:09.897 --> 02:11.800
>> A MOMENT TAL AND
UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGE.

02:11.900 --> 02:13.902
>> AN ENORMOUS TEST.
IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

02:14.002 --> 02:16.105
FOR THE BEGINNING OF HIS
PRESIDENCY.

02:16.205 --> 02:19.375
GETTING ON TOP OF THE COVID
PANDEMIC IS THE KEY TO

02:19.475 --> 02:27.685
REENERGIZING THE ECONOMY.

02:27.785 --> 02:38.798
>> COME ON.
GIVE ME A BREAK, MAN.

03:10.268 --> 03:12.438
>> HI, GUYS.

03:12.538 --> 03:13.606
>> HEY.

03:13.706 --> 03:14.607
>> YOU THERE?

03:14.707 --> 03:17.944
>> I AM.
I GOT A NICE BIG HAMBURGER GOING

03:18.045 --> 03:20.247
HERE.
I'M WAITING FOR THE ARTICLES OF

03:20.347 --> 03:22.984
IMPEACHMENT TO BE SENT OVER
TONIGHT.

03:23.084 --> 03:25.219
>> WILL THEY BE SENT TO YOUR
HOTEL ROOM?

03:25.319 --> 03:25.953
[ LAUGHTER ]

03:26.587 --> 03:28.424
>> I ORDERED BUFFALO WINGS AND
SOME ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT.

03:28.524 --> 03:33.530
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS HAVING?
[ LAUGHTER ]

03:33.630 --> 03:38.101
>> SO, THEY HAVE DECIDED TO TAKE
A TWO-WEEK PAUSE AND HAVE AN

03:38.201 --> 03:41.739
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL STARTING IN
THE MIDDLE OF FEBRUARY.

03:41.839 --> 03:44.476
>> BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE JOE
BIDEN ON YOUR FIRST MONDAY AND

03:44.576 --> 03:46.478
YOU HAVE A FEW DAYS IN OFFICE.

03:46.578 --> 03:51.350
>> ON THE PURE COVID FRONT, ALL
THE NEWS IS BAD, BAD, BAD.

03:51.451 --> 03:55.189
>> PEOPLE ARE READY TO TAKE THE
VACCINE BUT WHERE THE HELL ARE

03:55.289 --> 03:56.457
THEY?
THEY'RE NOT THERE.

03:56.557 --> 03:59.893
THE DOSES ARE NOT SHOWING UP
LIKE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO.

03:59.993 --> 04:01.996
>> YOU CAN'T UNDERSCORE ENOUGH
HOW DESPERATE PEOPLE ARE FOR

04:02.097 --> 04:02.897
MORE DOSES.

04:02.997 --> 04:04.132
>> I'M DESPERATE FOR A DOSE.

04:04.232 --> 04:07.603
>> WE NEED TO GET YOU
VACCINATED!

04:07.703 --> 04:10.706
>> I WANT A GOD DAMN VACCINE.
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET ONE.

04:10.806 --> 04:11.307
I'M 65.

04:12.075 --> 04:14.244
>> YOU HAD THE GNAW FEW WITH THE
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SAYING

04:14.344 --> 04:15.679
WE'RE GOING TO RELEASE THE
STOCKPILE.

04:15.779 --> 04:18.116
IT TURNS OUT THERE'S NO
STOCKPILE.

04:18.216 --> 04:22.386
IN ADDITION THERE COULD BE A
MORE LETHAL STRAIN OF THIS THING

04:22.488 --> 04:25.023
THAT IS SPREADING SECRETLY
UNDERNEATH THE ARRAY DOLLAR

04:25.124 --> 04:30.864
UNDERNEATH THE ARRAY DORADAR.

04:30.964 --> 04:32.098
>> WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THE
VACCINE IS.

04:32.198 --> 04:36.437
THERE'S NO GOOD DATA THAT THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS ON HOW

04:36.537 --> 04:38.005
MUCH HAS BEEN PRODUCED AND WHERE
YOU FIND IT.

04:38.105 --> 04:40.575
IT'S THE WORST SUCKER PUNCH IN
THE WORLD FOR THE BIDEN

04:40.675 --> 04:41.443
ADMINISTRATION.

04:41.977 --> 04:44.312
>> TRUMP WASN'T JUST UNPREPARED
BUT COME POUNDED THE PROBLEM.

04:44.412 --> 04:48.017
BUT GIVEN THE ENORMITY OF THE
TASK, THE PEOPLE THEY HAVE IN

04:48.117 --> 04:51.455
PLACE HAVE THE RIGHT KIND OF
EXPERIENCE.

04:51.555 --> 04:53.490
>> YOU HAVE RON KLAIN WHO DID
EBOLA.

04:53.590 --> 04:58.396
YOU HAVE JEFF AND ANDY SLOVAKIAN
YOU HAVE JEFF AND ANDY SLOVAWHO

04:58.496 --> 05:00.231
HELPED OBAMACARE.
THESE ARE PEOPLE EXPERIENCED IN

05:00.331 --> 05:03.502
THE RIGHT WAYS TO DEAL WITH
SOMETHING OF THIS SCALE.

05:03.602 --> 05:05.204
>> BUT PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO
BE PATIENT.

05:05.304 --> 05:08.241
IF YOU'RE NOT PRODUCING RESULTS.

05:08.341 --> 05:11.678
>> SO, THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION,
TO SOME EXTENT, CAN CONTROL THE

05:11.778 --> 05:15.650
FATE ON HOW WELL IT CAN DO ON
THE VACCINE DISTRIBUTION FRONT.

05:15.750 --> 05:17.385
THE PLACE IT'S NOT TRUE IS IN
LEGISLATION.

05:17.486 --> 05:23.059
AND THE BIDEN TEAM LOOKED AT
THIS COVID RELIEF PACKAGE.

05:23.159 --> 05:29.033
A $1.9 TRILLION STIMULUS AND
THEY'RE FACING A SENATE THAT IS

05:29.133 --> 05:30.801
50/50 AND SHOWING EVERY SIGN OF
IT ALREADY.

05:30.901 --> 05:36.007
>> WASHINGTON IS AS POLARIZED AS
IT EVER HAPPEN -- HAS BEEN.

05:36.107 --> 05:40.913
>> IT HAS TO BE SO PAINFUL FOR
BIDEN WHO SPOKE SO SPECIFICALLY

05:41.013 --> 05:43.583
ABOUT HEALING THE COUNTRY AND
ITS DIVISIONS.

05:43.683 --> 05:47.788
>> IN 2009, BARACK OBAMA, IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS,

05:47.888 --> 05:49.089
WANTED TO WORK IN A BIPARTISAN
WAY.

05:49.189 --> 05:52.694
IT TURNED OUT THE ONLY WAY TO
GET ANYTHING DONE IS A STRICTLY

05:52.794 --> 05:53.928
PARTY LINE BASIS.

05:54.028 --> 06:00.502
>> NOT ONE HOUSE REPUBLICAN
VOTED FOR THE ECONOMIC PACKAGE.

06:00.603 --> 06:04.908
>> YOU CAN'T MAKE IT THE MEASURE
OF YOUR SUCCESS AND YOU HAVE TO

06:05.008 --> 06:08.346
BE WILLING TO CUT OFF BIPARTISAN
DISCUSSIONS IF THEY'RE NOT GOING

06:08.446 --> 06:09.647
ANYWHERE.
FOR DEMOCRATS, THEY LOOK BACK

06:09.747 --> 06:12.484
AND SAY THE PROBLEM IS OBAMA
DIDN'T ACT AMBITIOUSLY ENOUGH

06:12.584 --> 06:16.655
WHEN HE DID HAVE THE POWER.
AND NOW THERE IS A DESIRE ON THE

06:16.755 --> 06:19.626
PART OF DEMOCRATS TO SAY FUCK
YOU, WE'RE DONE.

06:19.726 --> 06:21.094
>> WE'RE IN POWER.

06:21.194 --> 06:27.334
>> GOD DAMN, WE'RE GOING TO MAKE
YOU FEEL IT.

06:27.434 --> 06:28.469
>> COVID BILL IS EXTERNAL FOR
THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION.

06:28.569 --> 06:29.537
THEY'LL GET IT DONE.

06:29.838 --> 06:32.574
>> SO ALL OF THAT IS THE CONTEXT
IN WHICH THE ADMINISTRATION

06:32.674 --> 06:36.045
ARRIVES AND AFTER SPENDING THE
WHOLE 2020 TALKING ABOUT HOW HE

06:36.145 --> 06:41.318
WOULD HANDLE COVID DIFFERENTLY.
THIS IS, LIKE, WHERE RUBBER

06:41.418 --> 06:42.019
MEETS THE ROAD.

06:42.119 --> 06:45.155
>> YEAH.

06:45.255 --> 06:55.367
>> YEP.

07:06.380 --> 07:08.850
>> OH, MY GOD.
I'VE NEVER BEEN THIS CLOSE TO A

07:08.950 --> 07:11.286
PLANE LANDING.

07:11.386 --> 07:18.027
>> HUSTLE OVER INTO THE CARGO
HOLD.

07:18.127 --> 07:24.869
>> DO WE KNOW WHERE THIS CARGO
PLANE IS FROM?

07:24.969 --> 07:37.150
OH, THAT'S WEIRD THAT THE
VACCINES ARE BEING MANUFACTURED.

07:46.829 --> 07:48.597
WHILE THIS PARTICULAR SHIPMENT

07:48.697 --> 07:51.266
DOESN'T CONTAIN COVID VACCINES,
THESE ARE THE CONTAINERS THEY

07:51.368 --> 07:55.705
SHIP THEM IN AND THIS IS THE
PROCESS THE VACCINES GO THROUGH

07:55.805 --> 07:58.342
WHEN THEY ARRIVE.
THE WHOLE THING IS REALLY A

07:58.442 --> 08:01.445
WARTIME EFFORT.
COMMERCIAL PASSENGER AIRLINES,

08:01.545 --> 08:05.684
LIKE UNITED AND DELTA, ARE PART
OF THIS MASSIVE EFFORT TO

08:05.784 --> 08:10.223
TRANSPORT LIFE-SAVING VACCINES
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

08:10.323 --> 08:13.994
>> IT'S A COMPLICATED ENDEAVOR,
ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE OF THE

08:14.094 --> 08:22.203
VACCINES NEEDS TO BE KEPT AT 94
DEGREES BELOW ZERO.

08:22.303 --> 08:26.509
>> ANY OF THE CONTAINERS HAVE
THEIR OWN INTERNAL SYSTEM THAT

08:26.609 --> 08:29.612
TRACKS THE TEMPERATURE.
WE HAVE PERIODIC READINGS AT

08:29.712 --> 08:32.949
DIFFERENT POINTS ALONG THE
JOURNEY.

08:33.049 --> 08:35.286
>> WHAT IS THE TIME BETWEEN WHEN
IT GETS OFF THE AIRPLANE TO WHEN

08:35.386 --> 08:37.021
IT GETS PICKED UP?

08:37.121 --> 08:40.558
>> IT VARIES.
I WOULD SAY IT CAN BE AS QUICK

08:40.658 --> 08:41.126
AS AN HOUR.

08:41.226 --> 08:41.760
>> OKAY.

08:41.860 --> 08:43.929
>> TO AN HOUR AND A HALF.

08:44.029 --> 08:44.897
>> NO DELAYS?

08:44.997 --> 08:46.198
>> ABSOLUTELY.

08:46.299 --> 08:49.669
>> WHO IS PICKING IT UP?
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT?

08:49.769 --> 08:52.706
>> HOPEFULLY.
WELL, USUALLY.

08:52.807 --> 08:55.409
>> INDEED, THEN TAKE TO VACCINE
DISTRIBUTION SITES?

08:55.509 --> 08:57.345
>> THEY TAKE IT TO THEIR
CUSTOMER, YES.

08:57.446 --> 09:00.182
>> DO YOU FEEL A SIGH OF RELIEF
WHEN THE VACCINE HAS LEFT THE

09:00.282 --> 09:02.384
BUILDING LIKE WE DID IT?
WE'RE DONE?

09:02.484 --> 09:04.487
>> WE HIGH FIVE.
[ LAUGHTER ]

09:04.587 --> 09:08.459
>> I MEAN, I JUST FEEL LIKE
THERE'S PROBABLY SOME ANXIETY,

09:08.559 --> 09:09.560
RIGHT, YOU DON'T WANT TO MESS IT
UP.

09:09.660 --> 09:14.833
>> NO, WE DON'T.
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING

09:14.933 --> 09:19.070
GOES SMOOTHLY FOR ALL OF THE
SHIPMENTS BUT EVEN MORE SO FOR

09:19.170 --> 09:21.106
THIS.

09:21.207 --> 09:22.274
>> YES.

09:22.541 --> 09:25.812
>> VACCINE ROLLOUT IS GETTING A
LOT FASTER BUT IS STILL NOT FAST

09:25.912 --> 09:26.413
ENOUGH.

09:27.080 --> 09:29.683
>> PRESIDENT BIDEN IS SETTING
NEW TARGETS FOR VACCINE

09:29.783 --> 09:35.156
DISTRIBUTION.
EYEING A MORE AMBITIOUS ROLLOUT.

09:35.256 --> 09:40.863
>> CALIFORNIA IS THE STATE
HARDEST HIT BY THE CORONAVIRUS.

09:40.963 --> 09:42.765
>> LINES CONTINUE SNAKING AROUND
DODGER STADIUM, WHICH IS SERVING

09:42.866 --> 09:45.134
AS A DRIVE THROUGH VACCINATION
CENTER.

09:45.235 --> 09:49.073
>> IT PROVES THAT DEMAND IS FAR
OUTSTRIPPING SUPPLY.

09:49.173 --> 09:53.645
>> THE CDC -- YOU'LL GO IN FOR
THE NEXT 20 MINUTES.

09:53.745 --> 09:54.813
THANK YOU.
TAKE CARE.

09:54.913 --> 09:57.082
>> HELLO!
HOW ARE YOU GUYS?

09:57.182 --> 09:57.850
>> GOOD.

09:57.950 --> 10:00.953
>> YOU GETTING THE VACCINE
TODAY?

10:01.053 --> 10:02.355
YOU HEALTH CARE?
OKAY.

10:02.455 --> 10:06.059
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU YOUR CARD.
IT SAYS WHAT DOSE YOU GOT.

10:06.159 --> 10:08.028
THE MODERNA.
OKAY.

10:08.128 --> 10:09.898
WHICH ARM DO YOU WANT?
LEFT OR RIGHT?

10:09.998 --> 10:13.201
>> UMM, RIGHT.

10:13.301 --> 10:22.712
>> OKAY.

10:22.812 --> 10:25.983
>> I ROOT FOR THE CLIPPERS
EXCEPT WHEN THEY PLAY THE

10:26.083 --> 10:28.185
LAKERS.
I'M NOT A HATER.

10:28.286 --> 10:28.953
[ LAUGHTER ]
ALL RIGHT.

10:29.053 --> 10:31.623
THERE YOU GO, MAN.
WELCOME HOME.

10:31.723 --> 10:32.157
>> THANK YOU.

10:32.257 --> 10:33.559
>> PERFECT.

10:33.659 --> 10:34.793
>> IT'S AMAZING, ISN'T IT?

10:34.893 --> 10:36.663
>> YEAH.
YOU GET THAT VIEW FROM UP THERE

10:36.763 --> 10:42.870
AND YOU REALIZE WHAT IT IS.
IT'S THE BIGGEST WE THINK IN THE

10:42.970 --> 10:43.437
WORLD.

10:44.038 --> 10:46.440
>> AND WHAT IS THE BREAK DOWN OF
THE VACCINATION?

10:46.540 --> 10:47.142
>> AT THIS POINT, IT'S OVER 65.

10:47.242 --> 10:47.742
>> UH-HUH.

10:47.842 --> 10:48.910
>> AND WHAT ELSE?

10:49.010 --> 10:51.947
>> RIGHT NOW IT'S KIND OF
PROFESSION AND THEN IT'S AGE.

10:52.047 --> 10:55.518
I WOULD LIKE THE FREEDOM TO HELP
BY ZIP CODE.

10:55.618 --> 11:00.257
I WANT TO DO 55.
EVERYBODY ABOVE THAT AGE IN THE

11:00.357 --> 11:03.193
SAN FERNANDO VALLEY WHERE
THERE'S A HUGE OUTBREAK.

11:03.293 --> 11:04.963
ROYAL HEIGHTS NEAR DOWNTOWN.
SOUTH L.A.

11:05.063 --> 11:08.299
THEY'VE GOT MULTIGENERATIONS.
ONE IS AN ESSENTIAL WORKER.

11:08.399 --> 11:13.839
SO EVERYBODY IS VULNERABLE AND
KNOWS GRANT PARENT --

11:13.939 --> 11:18.144
GRANDPARENTS OR DYING OR MIDDLE
AGE PEOPLE THAT ARE DYING.

11:18.244 --> 11:20.514
I GREW UP HERE.
THANK GOD MY DAD DIDN'T HAVE TO

11:20.615 --> 11:24.318
SEE THIS BUT HE PASSED AWAY.
MY DAD WOULD HAVE BEEN 86 YEARS

11:24.418 --> 11:28.490
OLD.
WOULD HAVE BEEN HERE.

11:28.590 --> 11:34.364
YOU KNOW, HE WOULD HAVE BEEN
AMONG HIS GREAT DODGERS STADIUM

11:34.464 --> 11:36.734
MEMORIES.
A LOT OF SENIORS THAT COME HERE

11:36.834 --> 11:38.002
MUST BE EMOTIONAL.

11:38.102 --> 11:40.237
>> YOU SEE KIDS BRINGING THEIR
PARENTS.

11:40.337 --> 11:44.309
IT'S EMOTIONAL FOR THE PARENTS.
IT'S EMOTIONAL FOR THE KID.

11:44.409 --> 11:47.713
>> AND THEN YOU SEE COUPLES WHO
COME THROUGH HERE AND THE WIFE

11:47.813 --> 11:52.018
KNOWS HER HUSBAND'S CHRONIC
HEALTH CONDITION OR VICE VERSA.

11:52.118 --> 11:53.186
>> UH-HUH.

11:53.286 --> 11:58.960
>> AND IT REALLY FEELS LIKE
DRIVING THEM HERE IS SAVING

11:59.060 --> 11:59.694
THEIR LIFE.

11:59.894 --> 12:01.362
>> SO I DO CHECK IN IN THE
MORNING.

12:01.462 --> 12:02.664
YEAH.
IT'S THE FIRST PLACE.

12:02.764 --> 12:06.568
THEY JOKE IN THE CHECK IN LINE
IN THE FRONT IT'S VACCINE LAND.

12:06.669 --> 12:10.707
THE HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH.
WE FINALLY ARE THERE AFTER THIS

12:10.807 --> 12:13.309
YEAR OF HELL WE'VE BEEN LIVING
THROUGH.

12:13.410 --> 12:15.279
THEY FEEL THIS IS THE MOMENT
THEY'RE FINALLY SAFE.

12:15.379 --> 12:16.447
>> HI, YOU READY?

12:16.547 --> 12:17.548
>> READY.

12:17.648 --> 12:18.749
>> LEFT OR RIGHT ARM?

12:18.849 --> 12:20.484
>> LEFT.

12:20.585 --> 12:21.586
>> ALL RIGHT.
EASY, RIGHT?

12:21.687 --> 12:24.256
>> OH, YEAH.
ABSOLUTELY.

12:24.356 --> 12:28.161
I'M GOING TO OPEN THE DOOR SO I
DON'T HAVE TO REACH IN.

12:28.261 --> 12:29.862
>> 12,000 IS THE CAPACITY HERE.

12:29.962 --> 12:32.132
>> 12,000 EASILY.
CAPACITY IS MORE THAN THAT.

12:32.232 --> 12:36.603
IF YOU HAVE THE DOSAGE, YOU
COULD DO COMFORTABLY 20,000.

12:36.704 --> 12:40.141
THEY ALSO NEED THE SUPPLY.
FOR SOME IT'S LIKE WHY DON'T I

12:40.241 --> 12:43.612
HAVE MY VACCINE.
DAYS LIKE THIS, NOT ENOUGH

12:43.713 --> 12:45.748
PEOPLE ARE GETTING THEIR DOSES.
AT THIS PACE, WHICH IT WON'T

12:45.848 --> 12:50.487
STAY, IF IT WERE TO STAY, IT
WOULD BE A YEAR AND A HALF

12:50.587 --> 12:54.058
BEFORE EVERYBODY --

12:54.158 --> 12:57.361
>> THIS GUY IS NEW WITH CAMERAS.
BE A LITTLE GENTLE WITH HIM.

12:57.462 --> 13:00.132
>> IT'S NOT JUST THE MAYOR OF
THE CITY BUT THE MOST

13:00.232 --> 13:04.503
KNOWLEDGEABLE ON THE
IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS STUFF.

13:04.604 --> 13:14.782
>> NOW HIM.

13:16.051 --> 13:18.487
>> I HAVE BEEN TAKING ON BIG
CHALLENGES LIKE THIS FOR A

13:18.587 --> 13:19.654
DECADE NOW OR SO?

13:19.755 --> 13:20.455
>> YEAH.

13:20.555 --> 13:22.258
>> YEAH.
WE ALWAYS FELT ESPECIALLY

13:22.358 --> 13:25.762
STARTING IN HAITI THAT NOTHING
YOU CAN DO IS SUSTAINABLE

13:25.862 --> 13:27.231
WITHOUT COOPERATION AND
PARTNERSHIP WITH GOVERNANCE.

13:27.331 --> 13:28.499
>> RIGHT.

13:28.599 --> 13:30.934
>> SO WHEN THIS HAPPENED, WE HAD
WORKED THE EPIDEMIC OF ALCOHOL

13:31.034 --> 13:38.010
WORKED THE EPIDEMIC OF ALCOCHOL
IN HAITI AND THE NEXT THING YOU

13:38.110 --> 13:41.046
KNOW, WE WERE ABLE TO HELP SCALE
IT UP, YOU KNOW, BY THE BODIES

13:41.147 --> 13:45.418
OUT THERE AND THE YOUNG LEADERS
THAT HAVE BUILT UP THROUGH THE

13:45.519 --> 13:46.219
ORGANIZATION.

13:46.720 --> 13:52.727
>> AND WE CERTAINLY FEEL
CONFIDENT THAT WE HAVE SOLUTIONS

13:52.827 --> 13:53.928
THAT ARE REP CABLE FOR THE
COUNTRY AND THE MORE.

13:54.029 --> 13:57.432
>> SO THE BIDEN PEOPLE HAVE
CLEARLY -- THIS IS LIKE FRONT

13:57.533 --> 13:59.168
AND CENTER.
IN IS JOB ONE.

13:59.268 --> 14:01.838
WHAT IS THE BIG HEADLINE MESSAGE
THAT YOU GIVE TO THOSE GUYS

14:01.938 --> 14:03.773
ABOUT IT?

14:03.873 --> 14:05.643
>> HERE IS WHAT YOU NEED TO
KNOW?

14:05.743 --> 14:09.513
>> CIRCUMVENT THE BUREAUCRACIES.
INVENTORY DIRECTLY TO THE

14:09.613 --> 14:12.918
LOCALITY, ESPECIALLY WHERE YOU
HAVE A FUNCTIONAL ONE.

14:13.018 --> 14:17.023
AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO
SUPPORT ALL OF THAT.

14:17.123 --> 14:18.691
>> YEAH.
ROLL THE MONEY OUT TOMORROW AND

14:18.791 --> 14:22.930
THE VACCINES ANNE WE'LL -- AND
WE'LL DO THE REST.

14:23.030 --> 14:23.964
IT'S LITERALLY THAT SIMPLE.

14:24.064 --> 14:25.365
>> JOE BIDEN HAS BEEN PRESIDENT
FOR A WEEK.

14:25.465 --> 14:28.469
CAN YOU SEE A DIFFERENCE?
IF YOU CAN SEE A DIFFERENCE

14:28.570 --> 14:30.038
TANGIBLY, WHAT IS THE
DIFFERENCE?

14:30.138 --> 14:33.609
>> I'VE BEEN PART OF GROUPS,
WHETHER IT'S ON CLIMATE, WHETHER

14:33.709 --> 14:36.612
IT'S ON COVID, WHETHER IT'S ON
THE STIMULUS PACKAGE.

14:36.712 --> 14:38.849
WE'RE PART OF THOSE
CONVERSATIONS.

14:38.949 --> 14:42.786
AND THE TANGIBLE BENEFITS ARE,
OBVIOUSLY, THE AMERICAN RESCUE

14:42.886 --> 14:45.523
PLAN.
DOESN'T WRITE OFF LOCAL

14:45.623 --> 14:47.258
GOVERNMENTS.
BY THE WAY, MITCH McCONNELL AND

14:47.358 --> 14:51.230
OTHERS WERE HYPOCRITICAL ABOUT.
THEY FUNDED LOCAL GOVERNMENT BUT

14:51.330 --> 14:54.767
IT WAS SCHOOLS, TRANSIT AGENCIES
BUT WANTED TO MAKE AN ENEMY OF

14:54.868 --> 14:56.069
CITIES FOR WHATEVER REASON.

14:56.169 --> 15:02.443
>> WHAT DO YOU NEED TO SEE COME
OUT OF A COVID RELIEF/STIMULUS

15:02.543 --> 15:03.077
PACKAGE.

15:03.744 --> 15:05.246
>> I WAS HERE IN 2009 IT WAS TOO
SLOW AND NOT BIG ENOUGH.

15:05.346 --> 15:08.717
WE NEED TO GO FASTER AND BIGGER.

15:08.817 --> 15:13.356
>> THE RACE TO QUICKLY INOCULATE
AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE IS

15:13.456 --> 15:19.963
EVEN MORE URGENT BECAUSE OF NEW
VARIANTS DOCTORS SAY ARE HIGHLY

15:20.063 --> 15:21.565
TRANSMISBLE AND POSSIBLY MORE
DEADLY.

15:21.665 --> 15:23.868
>> WE'LL HEAR FROM TOP
SCIENTISTS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN

15:23.968 --> 15:24.669
A LONG TIME.

15:24.769 --> 15:25.870
>> THANK YOU FOR JOINING US
TODAY.

15:25.970 --> 15:29.575
I'M THE NEW DIRECTOR OF THE CDC.
THIS IS THE FIRST OF MANY

15:29.675 --> 15:33.947
BRIEFINGS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO
SPEAKING WITH YOU OFTEN AND

15:34.047 --> 15:36.216
SHARING CONTINUED ACTIONS THE
PUBLIC CAN TAKE TO PROTECT

15:36.316 --> 15:37.550
THEMSELVES AND THEIR LOVED ONES.

15:37.651 --> 15:42.657
>> I KNOW THAT MANY AMERICANS
ARE ANXIOUS AND EAGER TO GET

15:42.757 --> 15:44.593
VACCINATED.
I WANT YOU TO KNOW WE'RE TAKING

15:44.693 --> 15:50.400
THIS ISSUE ON WITH INCREDIBLE
URGENCY AND PURPOSE.

15:50.500 --> 15:53.603
HITTING OUR TARGET OF 1 MILLION
VACCINATIONS PER DAY.

15:53.703 --> 15:57.841
>> HEARING FROM THE PRESIDENT
THIS WEEK, HE'S PUSHING US TO

15:57.942 --> 15:58.776
VIEW 1 MILLION PER DAY AS THE
FLOOR.

15:58.876 --> 16:03.315
NOT THE CEILING.
TODAY WE'RE RELEASING MORE

16:03.415 --> 16:07.486
SUPPLY.

16:07.586 --> 16:13.327
>> AND THERE'S ANDY SLAVIN.

16:13.427 --> 16:16.330
>> OKAY.
THANKS.

16:16.430 --> 16:16.898
SORRY.

16:17.265 --> 16:20.568
>> YOU GOT A LOT TO DO.
I GET IT.

16:20.668 --> 16:21.235
[ LAUGHTER ]

16:21.336 --> 16:22.738
>> YOU WANT TO -- GO FOR IT.

16:22.838 --> 16:26.842
>> YEAH.
THAT'S GOOD.

16:33.283 --> 16:37.655
>> BIDEN NOTORIOUSLY HAS A
TENDENCY TO GET OVER HIS KNEES,

16:37.755 --> 16:40.859
IF YOU WILL, AND EVEN ON COVID,
IT FEELS LIKE HE'S GETTING OUT A

16:40.959 --> 16:44.831
LITTLE BIT AHEAD OF WHERE THE
TEAM IS AND SAYING, LIKE, HE

16:44.931 --> 16:47.834
WANTS 1.5 MILLION VAX WANTS 1.5
MILLION VACCINATIONS A

16:47.934 --> 16:50.904
DAY OR SAYING THERE MIGHT BE
HERD IMMUNITY BY THE END OF

16:51.005 --> 16:54.074
SUMMER WHICH IS AN EARLIER
PREDICTION YOU MADE.

16:54.174 --> 16:56.211
>> I THINK HE'S PUSHING THE TEAM
TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU COULDN'T

16:56.311 --> 16:59.581
POSSIBLY GO FAST ENOUGH FOR THIS
CRISIS.

16:59.681 --> 17:04.754
TO CHASE AN EXPONENTIALLY
GROWING VIRUS IS INCREDIBLY

17:04.854 --> 17:05.287
HARD.

17:05.488 --> 17:06.356
>> DID THE VERY I CAN'TS

17:06.656 --> 17:08.325
>> DID THE VERY I CAN'T --
VARIANTS KEEP YOU AT NIGHT?

17:08.425 --> 17:11.194
IT'S DISPERSED ON SUCH A GLOBAL
SCALE.

17:11.294 --> 17:14.799
THERE COULD BE A STRAIN THAT
COMES UP THAT RENDERS THE

17:14.899 --> 17:17.669
VACCINE INEFFECTIVE.
IS THAT THE STUFF YOU WORRY

17:17.770 --> 17:18.904
ABOUT AT NIGHT?

17:19.004 --> 17:23.443
>> I ONLY SMILE BECAUSE IT'S,
LIKE, ITEM 50 THAT KEEPS ME UP

17:23.543 --> 17:26.212
AT NIGHT.
AND, LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHETHER

17:26.312 --> 17:30.518
IT HELPS PEOPLE TO FEEL I'M NOT
SLEEPING BUT IT'S HARD TO SLEEP

17:30.618 --> 17:32.820
WHEN YOU HAVE THIS TO DO AND
THESE THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT.

17:32.920 --> 17:34.890
I THINK THAT'S OKAY.
I THINK SOMETIMES WE PROBABLY

17:34.990 --> 17:36.892
SHOULD HAVE DIFFICULT TIME
SLEEPING.

17:36.992 --> 17:41.631
>> WHAT IS THE NUMBER ONE THING
THAT KEEPS YOU UP AT NIGHT?

17:41.731 --> 17:44.567
>> THE NUMBER ONE THING THAT
KEEPS ME UP AT NIGHT?

17:44.667 --> 17:48.672
GETTING AS MANY PEOPLE AS
VACCINATED QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

17:48.772 --> 17:50.007
>> WHAT YOU CAME IN WITH --

17:50.107 --> 17:50.742
>> YEAH.

17:51.409 --> 17:53.611
>> THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S
PLAN SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN NO PLAN,

17:53.711 --> 17:54.145
RIGHT?

17:54.245 --> 17:54.913
>> YEAH.

17:55.413 --> 17:56.615
>> THERE WAS VERY LITTLE
INFRASTRUCTURE SET UP TO ROLL

17:56.715 --> 18:00.586
OUT THE VACCINE.
YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN GENTLE IN THE

18:00.686 --> 18:03.423
CRITICISM OF WHAT YOU INHERITED
BECAUSE OF THE REALITY THAT YOU

18:03.523 --> 18:07.095
NEED TRUMP VOTERS TO GET THE
VACCINE TO.

18:07.195 --> 18:09.197
YOU NEED TRUMP VOTERS TO WEAR
MASKS.

18:09.297 --> 18:12.835
YOU NEED RED STATES TO BUY IN IF
WE'RE GOING END THE CORONAVIRUS.

18:12.935 --> 18:17.005
>> PRESIDENT BIDEN SAYS WE NEED
TO UNIFY THE COUNTRY AND THIS IS

18:17.106 --> 18:18.541
NOT A DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN
ISSUE.

18:18.641 --> 18:22.512
THIS IS A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE.
CONGRESS NEEDS TO STEP UP.

18:22.612 --> 18:24.982
I THINK IT'S SHOCKING TO MANY
PEOPLE THAT THIS ISN'T

18:25.082 --> 18:29.154
CONSIDERED UNIVERSALLY AN
EMERGENCY AND THAT MONEY FOR

18:29.254 --> 18:34.126
VACCINATIONS, MONEY FOR SCHOOLS
ISN'T, LIKE, A 96-4 KIND OF

18:34.227 --> 18:35.361
VOTE.
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT

18:35.461 --> 18:37.797
SHOULD BREAK DOWN ON PARTY
LINES.

18:37.897 --> 18:40.667
I THINK PEOPLE ARE AROUND THE
COUNTRY WANT TO BE VACCINATED,

18:40.767 --> 18:45.373
THEY WANT TO SEE THEIR SCHOOLS
OPEN SAFELY, AND THOSE THINGS

18:45.473 --> 18:47.942
CAN'T HAPPEN UNLESS CONGRESS
GETS INVOLVED.

18:48.042 --> 18:50.612
THIS IS NOT A SOLO.
THIS IS AN ORG

18:50.713 --> 18:54.383
THIS IS AN ORCHESTRA.
IF YOU WANT TO DEFEAT COVID-19,

18:54.483 --> 18:58.688
IT'S THE BOSTON SYMPHONY
ORCHESTRA AND WE HAVE TO BE THE

18:58.788 --> 19:00.690
BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA.

19:00.790 --> 19:04.328
>> PRESIDENT BIDEN CONTINUES TO
PURSUE THAT DEAL FOR HIS

19:04.428 --> 19:09.902
CORONAVIRUS RELIEF PACKAGE.
REPUBLICANS ARE LARGELY BALKING

19:10.002 --> 19:13.072
AT THIS.
HOW DO THEY MAKE IT HAPPEN IN A

19:13.173 --> 19:14.274
BIPARTISAN WAY?

19:14.374 --> 19:19.079
>> THERE'S NO BETTER -- RELIEF
FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN AND THIS

19:19.180 --> 19:20.681
CONGRESS.
IN ORDER TO DO THAT, THEY HAVE

19:20.781 --> 19:25.387
TO GET IT THROUGH A 50/50 SENATE
WHICH IS A HUGE DMAJ THIS

19:25.487 --> 19:32.528
INCREDIBLY PARTISAN ENVIRONMENT.
SO IF WE'RE GOING TO TALK TO

19:32.628 --> 19:35.032
DEBBY STABENOW.
SHE SITS ON THE BUDGET AND

19:35.132 --> 19:38.635
FINANCE COMMITTEES, WHICH ARE
KEY TO PASSING THIS BILL.

19:42.774 --> 19:43.942
>> HI!
HOW ARE YOU?

19:44.042 --> 19:46.212
>> I'M GOOD.

19:46.312 --> 19:48.514
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU.
WELCOME TO NOW WHAT WILL ONCE

19:48.614 --> 19:49.215
AGAIN BE MY --

19:49.315 --> 19:50.916
>> YEAH.
THAT'S RIGHT.

19:51.016 --> 19:53.887
I WAS GOING TO ASK WHEN DO
YOU -- IT'S A PAINTING.

19:53.987 --> 19:57.225
>> OH, YEAH.
A PORTRAIT.

19:57.325 --> 19:59.794
WE'RE UNTIL THE WE'RE UNTIL IN
THE PROCESS OF G

19:59.894 --> 20:01.862
MINE TOGETHER NOW.
SENATOR ROBERTS, I DON'T KNOW IF

20:01.963 --> 20:06.168
HIS IS UP NOW BUT HE JUST GOT
HIS.

20:06.268 --> 20:08.871
BRAND NEW.
SO MINE WILL PROBABLY GO THERE.

20:08.972 --> 20:09.606
[ LAUGHTER ]

20:10.206 --> 20:12.508
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BILLS
$1.89 TRILLION, WHICH IS THE

20:12.609 --> 20:14.245
SIZE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
IN 1981.

20:14.345 --> 20:16.046
SO IT'S A BIG TICKET.

20:16.146 --> 20:16.880
>> YEAH.

20:17.448 --> 20:20.552
>> WHAT DO YOU SAY TO CRITICS OF
THE CURRENT BILL WHO SAY IT'S

20:20.652 --> 20:21.686
TOO EXPENSIVE?

20:21.953 --> 20:27.493
>> THIS NEEDS TO BE TO SOLVE THE
PROBLEM AND GET THINGS RIGHT.

20:27.593 --> 20:29.061
THIS IS A QUESTION OF
PRIORITIES.

20:29.161 --> 20:32.666
WHEN I SEE REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES
TALKING ABOUT THEY THINK IT'S

20:32.766 --> 20:37.238
TOO MUCH TO SPEND ON THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE, ON STEPPING

20:37.338 --> 20:40.743
DEATHS, I MIGHT LOOK BACK AT
2017 AND HOW REPUBLICANS CAME IN

20:40.843 --> 20:48.184
AND THEY MOVED QUICKLY ON A
PARTISAN BASIS ON OVER $2

20:48.285 --> 20:51.956
TRILLION TAX CUT THAT NOT MANY
FOLKS IN MY STATE ACTUALLY

20:52.056 --> 20:53.824
RECEIVED.
IT DIDN'T CREATE JOBS.

20:53.924 --> 20:56.127
IT DIDN'T TRICKLE DOWN.
OUR FOLKS ARE STILL WAITING FOR

20:56.227 --> 21:02.434
IT TO TRICKLE DOWN.
IT JUST HELPS FOLKS THAT WERE

21:02.534 --> 21:05.238
WEALTHY AND WELL CONNECTED.
THAT WAS THE REPUBLICAN FIGHT

21:05.338 --> 21:06.572
ALREADY.
THAT'S NOT MY PRIORITY.

21:06.673 --> 21:08.642
THAT'S NOT THE PRIORITY OF
PRESIDENT BIDEN OR VICE

21:08.742 --> 21:11.178
PRESIDENT HARRIS OR THE
DEMOCRATS.

21:11.278 --> 21:14.616
OUR PRIORITY IS EVERYBODY ELSE
HAS BEEN WORKING REALLY, REALLY

21:14.716 --> 21:18.153
HARD AND DESERVES A FAIR SHOT
AND DESERVES TO KNOW THEY'RE

21:18.253 --> 21:21.424
GOING TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT
THEIR FAMILIES.

21:21.524 --> 21:23.159
>> VERY CONTENTIOUS START FOR
THE SENATE.

21:23.259 --> 21:25.696
WHAT DOES IT SAY ABOUT THE
PROSPECT OF FINDING BIPARTISAN

21:25.796 --> 21:33.237
DEAL ON COVID GIVEN HOW SCHUMER
IS STARTING.

21:33.338 --> 21:34.439
>> WELL, MR. MITCH McCONNELL IS
DOING WHAT HE DOES.

21:34.539 --> 21:36.508
THE ULTIMATE OBSTRUCTIONIST
UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HIS

21:36.608 --> 21:40.813
GOAL, AS WE KNOW, TO MAKE HIM A
ONE-TERM PRESIDENT AND STOP

21:40.913 --> 21:45.185
ANYTHING IF IT LOOKED LIKE IT
WOULD HELP THE PRESIDENT BE

21:45.285 --> 21:46.453
SUCCESSFUL.
I DON'T KNOW YET HOW FAR HE'LL

21:46.553 --> 21:47.988
GO WITH THIS PRESIDENT.

21:48.089 --> 21:54.563
>> DO YOU THINK COVID COULD BE
SUCH A REAL, YOU KNOW, EXTESHL

21:54.663 --> 21:57.499
SENSE OF CRISIS FOR THIS COUNTRY
AND THE WORLD THAT MAYBE HE

21:57.600 --> 21:58.568
WOULD THINK DIFFERENTLY.

21:58.668 --> 22:01.471
>> I WOULD HOPE SO BUT I
REMEMBER AFTER WE DID THE

22:01.571 --> 22:05.309
C.A.R.E.S. ACT IN THE SPRING,
MITCH SAID HE DIDN'T THINK THERE

22:05.409 --> 22:09.114
WAS A NEED TO TAKE ANYMORE
ACTION IN MAY AND JUNE AND JULY

22:09.214 --> 22:12.217
AND AUGUST AND SO ON.
ULTIMATELY HE CAME ALONG.

22:12.317 --> 22:12.784
>> YEAH.

22:12.884 --> 22:13.952
>> HE DIDN'T LEAD IT.

22:14.053 --> 22:16.622
>> AT THE END OF THE DAY, I KNOW
YOU LIKE TO DO THIS IN A

22:16.722 --> 22:19.559
BIPARTISAN FASHION, BUT IF YOU
HAVE TO DO IT IN A PARTISAN

22:19.659 --> 22:21.228
FASHION, ARE YOU PREPARED TO DO
THAT?

22:21.328 --> 22:24.030
>> YES.
NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.

22:24.131 --> 22:28.069
WE'RE THE MAJORITY SO WE'LL ACT
LIKE THE MAJORITY.

22:28.169 --> 22:32.541
>> CONCERNS GROWING OVER WHAT
AFFECT THE NEW COVID VARIANT

22:32.641 --> 22:35.377
COULD HAVE IN THE COMING MONTHS.

22:35.477 --> 22:37.647
>> IT'S BEGINNING TO SPREAD.

22:37.747 --> 22:39.849
>> THIS IS DEPRESSING.
IT'S NOT WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO

22:39.949 --> 22:45.389
HEAR.
IT'S UPSEVENTYING -- UPSETTING.

22:45.489 --> 22:51.763
>> IT'S VITAL FOR AMERICA.

22:51.863 --> 22:56.903
>> 2008 WHEN CONGRESS WAS TOO
TIMID AND CONSTRAINED IN ITS

22:57.003 --> 22:59.373
RESPONSE TO THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL
CRISIS AND IT TOOK YEARS, YEARS

22:59.473 --> 23:03.010
FOR THE ECONOMY TO GET OUT OF
RECESSION.

23:03.110 --> 23:10.119
WE MUST NOT REPEAT THAT MISTAKE.

23:10.219 --> 23:14.089
>> IN JANUARY OF 2009, BARACK
OBAMA TOOK OVER IN THE MIDDLE OF

23:14.190 --> 23:19.129
A MAJOR FINANCIAL CRISIS.
BARACK OBAMA'S WHITE HOUSE CHIEF

23:19.229 --> 23:24.168
OF STAFF WAS RAHM EMANUEL.
RAHM KNOWS THE TENSION THAT

23:24.268 --> 23:29.842
COMES FROM WHEN THE PRESIDENT IS
TRYING TO GET A BIG PACKAGE OUT

23:29.942 --> 23:34.113
OF THE CONGRESS.

23:34.214 --> 23:38.452
>> A CRISIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO
FIX NOT ONLY ADDRESS THAT CRISIS

23:38.552 --> 23:43.859
BUT ADDRESS A LONG-TERM PROBLEM
THAT WAS UNDERNEATH THAT CRISIS.

23:43.959 --> 23:47.162
>> WHEN BARACK OBAMA COMES INTO
OFFICE, HE HAS TO IMMEDIATELY

23:47.262 --> 23:51.567
TAKE ACTION WITH A MAJOR
STIMULUS PACKAGE.

23:51.667 --> 23:55.472
>> WE START 2009 IN THE MIDST OF
A CRISIS UNLIKE ANY WE HAVE SEEN

23:55.572 --> 23:58.877
IN OUR LIFETIME.

23:58.977 --> 24:03.081
>> YOU'RE COMING INTO THE WHITE
HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF'S OFFICE.

24:03.181 --> 24:11.725
>> JANUARY 20th, 2009, AS THE
WORLD IS TEETER ON THE EDGE OF

24:11.825 --> 24:14.761
GLOBAL ECONOMIC COLLAPSE WHAT DO
YOU DO?

24:14.861 --> 24:19.100
>> WHAT DID YOU DO?

24:19.200 --> 24:20.268
>> OH.

24:20.368 --> 24:24.139
>> WE CALL IT THE E GREAT
RECESSION BUT OBAMA BEGINS TO

24:24.239 --> 24:31.347
RECEIVE ADVICE FROM THE
FINANCIAL TEAM THAT THIS COULD

24:31.448 --> 24:34.485
BECOME A SMALL DECISION.
THE AUTO INDUSTRY, WHICH WAS THE

24:34.585 --> 24:39.257
INDUSTRIAL BASE OF THE MIDWEST
COLLAPSED.

24:39.357 --> 24:42.895
YOU HAD A FINANCIAL SECTOR WHERE
NOBODY COULD GET A COLLEGE LOAN

24:42.995 --> 24:47.366
OR CAR LOAN OR SMALL BUSINESS
LOAN BECAUSE THERE WAS NOTHING

24:47.466 --> 24:53.608
GOING ON.

24:53.708 --> 24:56.244
>> IT WOULD BE OVERWHELMING
FORCE ON DAY ONE.

24:56.344 --> 24:59.548
YOU CAN'T GO THROUGH THESE ON A
CHECKLIST SO YOU HAD TO HIT THE

24:59.648 --> 25:00.482
WHOLE SYSTEM HARD.

25:00.583 --> 25:02.685
>> RIGHT.
AND THE FIRST MONTH YOU CAME IN

25:02.785 --> 25:06.256
AS AN OFFICE CHIEF OF STAFF AND
YOU WANTED TO PASS THE RECOVERY

25:06.356 --> 25:10.561
ACT BUT THERE WAS PRESSURE TO DO
IT IN A BIPARTISAN WAY.

25:10.661 --> 25:11.395
LIKE, WHAT WAS THAT?

25:11.495 --> 25:13.164
>> IT DID HAPPEN IN A BIPARTISAN
WAY.

25:13.264 --> 25:15.601
>> YOU HAVE THREE REPUBLICANS.
THREE REPUBLICAN SENATORS VOTE

25:15.701 --> 25:21.341
FOR IT BUT NOBODY IN THE HOUSE.

25:21.441 --> 25:22.642
>> WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THIS?

25:22.742 --> 25:30.351
>> YOU NEEDED REPUBLICAN VOTES.
PEOPLE FORGET WE HAD A DEMOCRAT

25:30.451 --> 25:37.125
OF NEBRASKA WHO IS SAYING I'M
ONLY VOTING FOR THIS IF YOU HAVE

25:37.225 --> 25:37.893
REPUBLICANS.

25:38.494 --> 25:45.402
>> HARRY REID AND I WERE HOLDING
ON TO SUSAN COLIN'S ANKLES.

25:45.502 --> 25:46.603
ALSO, THEY WOULD WORK WITH THEM.

25:46.703 --> 25:49.674
>> THE PRESIDENT IS ABOUT TO
SIGN INTO LAW WHAT IS, I

25:49.774 --> 25:51.376
BELIEVE, A LANDMARK ACHIEVEMENT.

25:51.476 --> 25:55.581
>> AND WE HAD TO BUILD IT THAT
WAY BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT OF THE

25:55.681 --> 25:59.452
UNITED STATES WANTED A BIG
AGENDA.

25:59.552 --> 26:00.453
MAINLY AROUND HEALTH CARE AND
FINANCIAL REFORM.

26:00.553 --> 26:01.154
>> RIGHT.

26:01.788 --> 26:04.557
>> WE'RE BUILDING BIPARTISAN
MAJORITIES IN THE FIRST YEAR.

26:04.658 --> 26:09.196
>> FOR BIDEN, YOU KNOW, EVERYONE
IS SAYING THE BIG LESSON IS

26:09.296 --> 26:11.233
DON'T WAIT FOR THE REPUBLICANS
AND THEY'RE HOPING THEY'RE NEVER

26:11.333 --> 26:14.936
GOING TO COME AROUND.

26:15.037 --> 26:15.504
>> NO.

26:16.372 --> 26:18.441
>> I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES
YOU WANT TO LOOK AT IT REQUIRES

26:18.541 --> 26:19.475
A SET OF SOLUTIONS THAT ARE X.

26:19.575 --> 26:21.277
>> RIGHT.

26:21.378 --> 26:27.385
>> THE CONGRESS, GIVEN HOW
EVENLY DIVIDED IT IS, ONLY

26:27.485 --> 26:32.625
PERMITS Y.

26:32.725 --> 26:37.797
>> WHEN THEY OPENED THE PRESS
BRIEFING SHE STARTED WE'VE DOING

26:37.898 --> 26:40.100
MEETINGS WITH PEOPLE ON THE HILL
AND MAYORS.

26:40.200 --> 26:43.471
IT'S LIKE THEY'RE TRYING TO LAY
DOWN THE RECORD THAT THEY HAVE

26:43.571 --> 26:46.140
REACHED OUT.
SO WHEN REPUBLICANS DON'T GET ON

26:46.240 --> 26:49.311
BOARD, THEY CAN SHOW THE COUNTRY
THEY TRIED.

26:49.411 --> 26:51.680
>> BUT IF YOU GET BIPARTISAN,
GREAT.

26:51.780 --> 27:15.174
IF YOU DON'T, GET CAUGHT TRYING.
THAT'S
