WEBVTT

02:05.834 --> 02:08.303
<i>There are those
who believe</i>

02:08.377 --> 02:11.882
<i>that life here
began out there,</i>

02:12.758 --> 02:15.682
<i>far across the universe,</i>

02:15.761 --> 02:18.640
<i>with tribes of humans</i>

02:18.722 --> 02:23.023
<i>who may have been the
forefathers of the Egyptians</i>

02:23.101 --> 02:27.322
<i>or the Toltecs,
or the Mayans,</i>

02:27.397 --> 02:31.743
<i>that they may have been the
architects of the great pyramids,</i>

02:32.277 --> 02:36.123
<i>or the lost civilizations
of Lemuria</i>

02:36.198 --> 02:37.871
<i>or Atlantis.</i>

02:39.159 --> 02:43.460
<i>Some believe that there may
yet be brothers of man</i>

02:44.081 --> 02:47.585
<i>who even now fight to survive</i>

02:47.668 --> 02:51.423
<i>far, far away
amongst the stars.</i>

03:18.490 --> 03:22.791
Noble delegates, I realize you're all
anxious to get back to your ships

03:22.869 --> 03:25.122
before our rendezvous
with the Cylons.

03:25.205 --> 03:29.836
But I think it appropriate to
toast the most significant event

03:29.918 --> 03:32.137
in the history of mankind.

03:33.171 --> 03:36.801
I would like to raise
my chalice to you,

03:37.718 --> 03:40.392
not merely
as the Quorum of 12,

03:40.470 --> 03:43.019
representing
the 12 Colonies of man,

03:43.098 --> 03:45.647
but as my friends,

03:45.726 --> 03:48.900
the greatest leaders
ever assembled.

03:50.522 --> 03:53.446
As we approach the seventh
millennium of time,

03:53.525 --> 03:58.577
the human race at last will
find peace, thanks to you.

03:58.655 --> 04:00.032
To peace.

04:04.786 --> 04:07.130
Starbuck, he's coming.
What are you going to say?

04:07.205 --> 04:09.799
Zac, now just calm down.
Why are you so nervous?

04:09.875 --> 04:11.468
He still thinks of me
as his little brother.

04:11.543 --> 04:12.886
Yeah, well,
you're acting like one.

04:12.961 --> 04:15.089
Now, listen,
it's just a routine patrol.

04:15.172 --> 04:16.923
Why is it
so important to you?

04:17.007 --> 04:18.509
Because it is.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.219
Look, I'm a Warrior.
I earned that.

04:20.302 --> 04:21.428
I want to prove
that to him.

04:21.511 --> 04:23.934
I know, Zac, but this may
not be the best time.

04:24.014 --> 04:27.314
It's a peace envoy! What
possible trouble could there be?

04:27.392 --> 04:28.894
That's not the point.

04:28.977 --> 04:31.901
Starbuck, you promised.
I know.

04:31.980 --> 04:34.233
Hey, Starbuck, what are you doing?
We're going on patrol.

04:34.316 --> 04:35.613
Uh...

04:35.692 --> 04:38.366
He can't make it.
Starbuck's not feeling well.

04:39.404 --> 04:40.405
Oh?

04:40.489 --> 04:43.208
Yeah, well, it's, um...

04:45.952 --> 04:48.705
Well, that's kind of
short notice,

04:48.789 --> 04:51.759
I mean, with everybody not
wanting to go on this patrol.

04:51.833 --> 04:54.302
Everybody wants to
celebrate the armistice.

04:54.377 --> 04:56.800
I wonder who
I'm gonna be able to find.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.302
Uh...

04:59.007 --> 05:00.930
Yes, Zac,
you have a suggestion?

05:02.511 --> 05:05.481
Oh, come on, I've studied the coordinates
from here to the Cylon capital.

05:05.555 --> 05:06.898
My Ship's ready to go!

05:07.265 --> 05:09.313
Well, that's lucky.
Isn't it, Starbuck?

05:09.392 --> 05:10.894
Yeah, that's a real
stroke of luck.

05:12.062 --> 05:15.737
Well, I guess you're just gonna have
to pull Starbuck's patrol with me.

05:16.566 --> 05:17.909
WOW!

05:22.697 --> 05:23.949
Were we ever like that?

05:24.032 --> 05:26.160
I don't know. I can't
remember that far back.

05:26.243 --> 05:28.166
Listen, maybe I ought
to go along.

05:28.245 --> 05:29.838
No, he's gonna be
just fine.

05:29.913 --> 05:31.915
I mean, it's not as if
we're at war, right?

05:31.998 --> 05:33.500
See you later.

05:34.251 --> 05:37.095
Take care of the stomach.
Yeah, I will.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.517
Section 12,
launch bay Alpha,

05:42.592 --> 05:44.265
stand by to launch
fighter probe.

05:44.386 --> 05:47.811
<i>Acknowledge input.
Recorded and functioning.</i>

05:47.931 --> 05:51.686
<i>Vector coordinates coded
and transferred. Acknowledge.</i>

05:51.768 --> 05:53.645
<i>Acknowledged.
Ready to launch.</i>

05:53.728 --> 05:58.029
Core systems transferring control to probe craft.
Launch when ready.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.387
<i>You forget how different
it is out here.</i>

06:27.470 --> 06:28.642
<i>This is nothing.</i>

06:28.722 --> 06:32.067
<i>When the war is officially over, we may be
able to get back to deep star exploration.</i>

06:32.142 --> 06:33.769
<i>That's the challenge,</i> Zac.

06:33.852 --> 06:36.071
<i>Let's roll over and take
a look at Lianus Vector.</i>

06:44.571 --> 06:46.744
Baltar, my friend,

06:46.823 --> 06:49.622
this armistice conference
would not have been possible

06:49.701 --> 06:52.295
without your tireless work.

06:52.370 --> 06:56.921
You have secured for yourself
a place in the history books.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.300
That the Cylons chose me as their
liaison to the Quorum of the 12

07:00.378 --> 07:03.678
was an act of providence,
not skill.

07:14.351 --> 07:18.197
I see the party is not a huge
success with all my children.

07:19.981 --> 07:22.484
What awaits us out there
is what troubles me.

07:22.984 --> 07:26.614
Surely you don't cling to your
suspicions about the Cylons?

07:27.530 --> 07:29.532
They asked
for this armistice.

07:29.824 --> 07:31.041
They want peace.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.539
Forgive me, Mr. President,

07:32.869 --> 07:36.339
but they hate us with every
fiber of their existence.

07:37.040 --> 07:40.010
We love freedom.
We love independence,

07:40.085 --> 07:43.510
to feel, to question,
to resist oppression.

07:44.589 --> 07:49.811
To them, it's an alien way of
existing they will never accept.

07:49.928 --> 07:53.558
But they have,
through Baltar.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.893
They have sued for peace.

07:58.228 --> 08:01.152
Yes. Of course,
you're right.

08:16.204 --> 08:19.799
<i>Apollo, two targets on my scanner
just above the old moon Cimtar.</i>

08:20.291 --> 08:23.545
<i>It could be a storm. I think we'll
be coming right through it.</i>

08:23.628 --> 08:26.131
<i>Look, you hold positions and
cover me while I take a look.</i>

08:26.214 --> 08:27.215
<i>Let me get my turbos.</i>

08:51.948 --> 08:54.246
<i>- Well, look at that.
- What is it?</i>

08:55.577 --> 08:56.874
<i>I'll tell you in a flash.</i>

09:02.625 --> 09:06.175
<i>Warbook says a Cylon tanker.
Scanner reads it's empty.</i>

09:06.546 --> 09:08.469
<i>Apollo, I have a funny
feeling about this.</i>

09:08.798 --> 09:09.970
<i>Well, we came to look.</i>

09:21.811 --> 09:25.736
<i>There's the other ship
tucked in nice and neat.</i>

09:25.815 --> 09:27.613
<i>I wonder what she's doing.</i>

09:29.903 --> 09:32.406
<i>I can't read anything inside.
She's jamming us.</i>

09:32.489 --> 09:34.412
<i>Warbook says she's a freighter.
My foot.</i>

09:34.491 --> 09:36.664
<i>If she's jamming us, she's hiding something.
I'm going around her.</i>

09:46.294 --> 09:49.924
<i>Nothing but a harmless mist.
Not heavy at all.</i>

09:51.216 --> 09:54.846
<i>I don't see why they'd send up
all that electronic jamming.</i>

09:59.849 --> 10:01.692
<i>Let's get out of here.
Why?</i>

10:03.394 --> 10:05.021
<i>I'll explain later.</i>

10:05.605 --> 10:08.825
<i>Colonial Viper in quadrant.
intercepting.</i>

10:16.282 --> 10:17.909
<i>I see what you mean.</i>

10:33.216 --> 10:37.187
<i>It's an ambush. And they've got enough
firepower to destroy the entire fleet.</i>

10:45.436 --> 10:46.653
<i>They're jamming
our transmission.</i>

10:46.729 --> 10:48.572
<i>We're not gonna make it
giving them our backs.</i>

10:48.690 --> 10:52.160
<i>How many of them can you make out?
Four.</i>

10:52.235 --> 10:55.455
<i>When I hit three, hit your reverse
thrusters and maximum braking flaps.</i>

10:55.530 --> 10:58.875
<i>We'll give them a little surprise.
One, two, three.</i>

11:06.875 --> 11:09.754
<i>Turbos, full forward
thrust. Now.</i>

11:16.467 --> 11:17.764
<i>Right here, you creeps.</i>

11:30.773 --> 11:32.446
<i>Hey, not bad,
little brother.</i>

11:33.109 --> 11:34.611
<i>Okay, you go after
the guys on the right.</i>

11:45.955 --> 11:48.253
<i>Yahoo!
Apollo, I'll get this one.</i>

11:51.836 --> 11:53.884
<i>Zac, look out!
Behind you!</i>

11:56.633 --> 11:58.681
<i>I can't lose him!
He's right on my tail!</i>

11:58.760 --> 12:00.888
<i>Hang on, I'm coming.</i>

12:00.970 --> 12:02.643
<i>Steady.
Hurry, Apollo!</i>

12:02.722 --> 12:03.814
<i>Steady.</i>

12:08.478 --> 12:10.901
<i>Nice shooting,
but they hit my high engine.</i>

12:10.980 --> 12:13.324
<i>That's okay, little brother.
We got all of 'em.</i>

12:13.399 --> 12:16.027
<i>The day those guys can
outfight us by a 10-to-one margin...</i>

12:18.154 --> 12:21.158
<i>Apollo, better look
at your scanner.</i>

12:23.993 --> 12:26.496
<i>But 1,000-to-one,
that's not fair.</i>

12:26.621 --> 12:28.965
<i>What's it mean? It means there
isn't going to be any peace.</i>

12:29.040 --> 12:30.917
<i>There may not be much of anything
if we don't warn the fleet.</i>

12:34.629 --> 12:37.724
<i>Do it. I'm short an engine. You know!
won't be able to keep up with you.</i>

12:37.840 --> 12:40.764
<i>Zac, I'm not going to leave you.
You have to.</i>

12:41.511 --> 12:43.684
<i>I'm putting my foot in the turbo.
I'll make it back ahead of them.</i>

12:43.763 --> 12:47.484
<i>Now go on. You've got to warn the fleet.
I'll be all right.</i>

12:48.184 --> 12:51.154
<i>You can fly with me any time,
little brother.</i>

12:52.480 --> 12:53.697
<i>Good luck.</i>

13:01.030 --> 13:04.250
<i>Galactica Control, this is Commander
Adama returning from Atlantia.</i>

13:04.325 --> 13:07.204
- Request permission to land.
- Permission granted.

13:09.372 --> 13:10.544
Something's wrong.

13:11.791 --> 13:12.792
What is it?

13:13.084 --> 13:15.086
I don't know. They just
put the ship on alert.

13:25.722 --> 13:28.100
Atlantia, this is
Galactica Core Control.

13:28.182 --> 13:29.729
Request assistance
in communicating...

13:29.809 --> 13:32.483
What's been happening?
Our patrol ran into trouble.

13:32.562 --> 13:34.735
We picked up some signals,
but they're being jammed.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.908
It could be smugglers,
or pirates, or...

13:38.568 --> 13:39.785
Get me
the President, please.

13:43.031 --> 13:47.787
Mr. President, our patrol is under attack.
We don't know by whom.

13:47.869 --> 13:51.715
As a precautionary measure, I would
like to launch intercept fighters.

13:51.789 --> 13:56.465
I should think that's highly inadvisable
in view of the delicacy of our situation.

13:56.544 --> 13:58.512
Quite right, Baltar.

13:58.588 --> 14:02.513
Commander, as a precautionary
measure, I insist upon restraint.

14:03.259 --> 14:06.479
<i>If this turns out to be an encounter
with some outlaw traffic,</i>

14:06.554 --> 14:08.727
<i>we could jeopardize
the whole cause of peace</i>

14:08.806 --> 14:12.026
<i>by displaying fighters when we
are so close to our rendezvous.</i>

14:12.101 --> 14:15.776
Mr. President, two of my
starfighters are under armed attack.

14:15.897 --> 14:17.570
<i>By forces unknown.</i>

14:17.940 --> 14:20.784
<i>You are not to launch until
the situation is more clear.</i>

14:20.860 --> 14:23.830
Sir, may I at least urge you to bring
the fleet to a state of alert?

14:24.530 --> 14:27.409
<i>I will consider that.
Thank you, Commander.</i>

14:29.285 --> 14:31.959
He'll consider it?
He'll consider it?

14:32.038 --> 14:33.631
It's all right.

14:33.706 --> 14:36.380
I'm sorry, Commander.
It's just that...

14:36.459 --> 14:38.461
Well...
Well, what?

14:39.337 --> 14:42.637
The patrol is under the
command of Captain Apollo.

14:43.341 --> 14:46.185
Well, if I can't have confidence
in my first-born son,

14:46.260 --> 14:48.479
whom can I depend upon?

14:48.554 --> 14:52.400
Commander, Zac is with him.
It's his first patrol.

14:57.188 --> 14:58.565
Thank you.

15:10.493 --> 15:12.245
Come on, baby.
Give me all you got.

15:15.998 --> 15:17.295
Still no word
from our fighters, sir.

15:17.375 --> 15:19.218
Their transmission is
being deliberately jammed.

15:19.293 --> 15:20.340
If we don't launch...

15:20.420 --> 15:23.594
We cannot launch. It's
been expressly forbidden.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.975
However...

15:27.260 --> 15:30.764
This might be a very good time
for battle stations drill.

15:30.847 --> 15:33.475
Sound the alert, Colonel.
Yes, sir.

15:34.183 --> 15:37.107
You may never see
another one, fellows.

15:37.186 --> 15:41.692
A perfect pyramid. Unless there's
a better hand, the pot's mine.

15:48.531 --> 15:49.703
Wait, wait!

15:51.701 --> 15:54.705
Wait, wait, wait! Come back!
Duty calls!

15:56.330 --> 15:57.627
Let's go!

15:59.959 --> 16:02.178
Sir, our long-range
scanner shows

16:02.253 --> 16:05.052
a large number of ships
headed this way at high speed.

16:05.131 --> 16:07.304
A single patrol craft
is approaching, Commander.

16:07.383 --> 16:09.010
Get that pilot up here
as soon as he lands.

16:09.093 --> 16:11.471
Get me the President.
Yes, sir.

16:28.529 --> 16:30.623
What's going on? It's
nothing to worry about.

16:30.698 --> 16:32.826
Probably some kind of aerial
salute for the President

16:32.909 --> 16:35.003
while he signs the armistice.

16:35.077 --> 16:36.750
Sure ruined a good card game.

16:37.121 --> 16:38.168
<i>Commander?</i>

16:38.539 --> 16:43.090
Mr. President, a wall of unidentified
craft is closing in on the fleet.

16:43.169 --> 16:45.718
Possibly a Cylon
welcoming committee.

16:46.839 --> 16:49.968
Sir, may I suggest we launch a
welcoming committee of our own?

16:50.384 --> 16:54.514
Mr. President, there remain many
hostile feelings amongst our Warriors.

16:54.597 --> 16:56.565
<i>The likelihood of an
unfortunate incident</i>

16:56.641 --> 17:00.066
with all those pilots
in the sky at once...

17:00.144 --> 17:01.191
Commander?

17:01.270 --> 17:05.275
Sir, did Count Baltar suggest that our
forces sit here totally defenseless?

17:05.358 --> 17:08.077
My friend, we are
on a peace mission.

17:08.152 --> 17:11.531
The first peace man has
known in 1,000 years.

17:17.662 --> 17:18.959
<i>Stand by to attack.</i>

17:19.329 --> 17:21.377
<i>Come on, baby.
Not much farther.</i>

17:26.712 --> 17:29.966
<i>Blue Flight Two, in trouble!
Request emergency approach.</i>

17:31.300 --> 17:32.722
Mr. President!
Commander.

17:32.802 --> 17:36.773
One of our patrol ships is under attack
from the main force approaching the fleet.

17:36.847 --> 17:40.522
Mr. President, your welcoming
committee is firing at our patrol!

17:40.643 --> 17:41.860
<i>Baltar?</i>

17:44.230 --> 17:45.356
<i>Baltar?</i>

17:52.113 --> 17:53.330
<i>We made it.</i>

17:57.493 --> 17:59.416
<i>Patrol to fleet! Patrol
to fleet, I need help!</i>

18:15.886 --> 18:17.012
<i>What was that?</i>

18:19.307 --> 18:21.560
That was my son,
Mr. President.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.604
No. No. No.

18:49.795 --> 18:52.674
Positive shield, now!
Launch fighters!

19:00.681 --> 19:01.978
All batteries commence fire!

19:02.058 --> 19:05.403
<i>All fire control stations
manned and operational.</i>

19:12.568 --> 19:14.070
<i>Launch all remaining Vipers.</i>

19:22.036 --> 19:24.915
Sir, they're off.
Fighters launched, sir.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.500
Were the other ships
able to launch their fighters?

19:27.583 --> 19:29.176
Negative, sir.

19:30.086 --> 19:31.588
Lord help us.

19:38.135 --> 19:41.435
<i>Engineering reports laser
hits on starboard engine.</i>

19:42.098 --> 19:44.977
Cylons. It was an ambush. I had to leave Zac.
He's disabled.

19:45.101 --> 19:47.024
I'd like to go back and lead him in.
it won't be possible.

19:47.103 --> 19:48.195
Father, I didn't know
what else to do!

19:48.270 --> 19:50.398
If I don't go back,
he doesn't stand a chance!

19:50.481 --> 19:53.781
<i>Atlantia to all battlestars, we
are under attack. Repeat, under attack.</i>

19:53.859 --> 19:55.202
Zac?

19:55.277 --> 19:57.371
His ship was destroyed
just short of the fleet.

19:57.655 --> 19:59.703
<i>Transferring
target scanners...</i>

20:03.744 --> 20:06.714
<i>Reduce speed to maintain
position with Atlantia.</i>

20:09.750 --> 20:12.173
<i>Hey, heads up, Boomer.
There's a pair on your tail.</i>

20:16.382 --> 20:17.975
<i>Pull up, Boomer!
I'll try to get him off.</i>

20:22.763 --> 20:23.980
Nice shooting!

20:32.314 --> 20:35.033
Captain, we have to know how many
base ships we're dealing with.

20:35.568 --> 20:38.242
No base ships. You must
be mistaken, Captain.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.618
Fighters couldn't function this far
from Cylon without base ships.

20:40.698 --> 20:42.746
No base ships. They don't
carry enough fuel.

20:42.825 --> 20:44.668
Just fighters.
Maybe 1,000.

20:44.744 --> 20:47.372
How do you account
for that, Apollo?

20:48.164 --> 20:51.839
I don't know. We picked up an
empty tanker on our scanner.

20:51.917 --> 20:54.136
It's my guess the Cylons used
it to refuel for the attack

20:54.211 --> 20:57.556
after flying to that point from
wherever their base ships are.

20:57.631 --> 21:01.761
Why operate this far from Cylon without
base ships when it isn't necessary?

21:01.844 --> 21:05.348
They would have been well out
of our range at the old moon.

21:06.891 --> 21:09.565
Unless it was necessary

21:09.643 --> 21:12.271
for them to be
somewhere else.

21:12.354 --> 21:14.197
Get me the President!

21:22.615 --> 21:24.458
<i>Hey, Starbuck,
it's dangerous around here!</i>

21:27.995 --> 21:31.499
Mr. President, I request
permission to leave the fleet.

21:31.582 --> 21:35.212
I have reason to suspect our home
planets may face imminent attack.

21:42.343 --> 21:46.098
<i>- Maintain contact!
- ...fires out of... Request Vipers!</i>

21:46.180 --> 21:49.059
<i>How could I have been
so completely wrong?</i>

21:51.185 --> 21:54.064
<i>I have led the entire
human race to ruin.</i>

21:59.735 --> 22:00.861
Mr. President?

22:04.740 --> 22:07.289
<i>Group 3, Vectors 1-7 and 2-8.</i>

22:07.701 --> 22:09.499
<i>Arm and attack Atlantia.</i>

22:24.093 --> 22:26.471
<i>I got him on the left.
I got him on the right.</i>

22:41.652 --> 22:43.780
<i>Atlantia
Death Squadron, attack.</i>

22:54.832 --> 22:56.425
Negative shield, now!

23:09.555 --> 23:10.727
Back to your posts now.

23:14.685 --> 23:16.028
Oh, my God.

23:23.944 --> 23:28.370
Commander, our long-range scanners
have picked up Cylon base ships

23:28.449 --> 23:32.499
at grids 0-3-5,
1-2-6 and 2-5-8.

23:33.537 --> 23:37.542
That puts them well within striking range
of the planets Virgon, Sagitara and...

23:37.625 --> 23:39.502
Yes, and Caprica.

24:19.500 --> 24:21.844
<i>By your command.</i>

24:25.798 --> 24:27.721
Speak, Centurion.

24:27.800 --> 24:32.647
<i>All base ships are now in
range to attack the Colonies.</i>

24:32.721 --> 24:37.648
The final annihilation of
the life-form known as man.

24:37.726 --> 24:39.649
Let the attack begin.

25:07.589 --> 25:09.466
Helm, bring us around.

25:09.550 --> 25:12.770
We're withdrawing.
Flank speed for home.

25:34.366 --> 25:36.209
Commander, our long-range
scanner picks up

25:36.285 --> 25:40.210
wave after wave of small ships
headed towards all inner planets.

25:59.224 --> 26:00.976
Boxey!

26:10.944 --> 26:12.491
No! Boxey!

26:30.881 --> 26:34.886
Please, miss! The building's going to topple!
Everybody, run for cover!

26:35.677 --> 26:37.270
Run! Run!

26:37.346 --> 26:39.314
Hurry, find cover!
Get out of here!

26:41.016 --> 26:42.188
Stay down here!

26:44.228 --> 26:45.855
No! No!

26:56.323 --> 26:58.997
My daggit! Where is he?
He's fine. He's fine.

27:10.379 --> 27:12.222
It's going to be all right.

27:13.549 --> 27:16.393
<i>...on the
southern peninsula.</i>

27:16.927 --> 27:19.976
<i>Thirty one cities are known
to be under heavy attack.</i>

27:37.239 --> 27:40.664
<i>This is the most terrible
thing I've ever witnessed.</i>

27:40.742 --> 27:42.836
<i>Red 1-3-niner,
we're on fire.</i>

27:42.911 --> 27:45.334
<i>Emergency, fire in Red 1-3.</i>

27:46.665 --> 27:48.133
...a sea of fire.

27:48.208 --> 27:50.961
<i>The water supply is cut off.
There is no water!</i>

27:54.339 --> 27:56.341
<i>My orders are
to cover the relay.</i>

27:56.425 --> 27:58.348
<i>The central area
is under attack.</i>

27:58.427 --> 28:01.601
<i>A second wave is coming in.
We have no defenses!</i>

28:03.724 --> 28:05.567
<i>Is this channel operative?</i>

28:09.771 --> 28:13.196
Oh, Zac!
And all the others!

28:13.275 --> 28:17.200
They trusted us to protect
them, and we... Oh, God.

28:27.080 --> 28:28.627
There really
wasn't any choice.

28:33.503 --> 28:37.133
Commander, Cylon base ships
on long-range scanner,

28:37.216 --> 28:39.469
launching to all
outer planets.

28:40.886 --> 28:42.684
No hope, Commander.

28:45.307 --> 28:47.560
What about Sagitara?

28:47.643 --> 28:50.112
The planet's
in flames, Commander.

28:55.442 --> 28:59.948
Have my shuttlecraft prepared, please.
Shuttlecraft?

29:00.989 --> 29:03.538
I'm going down on
the surface of Caprica.

29:03.617 --> 29:05.415
Commander, that is
out of the question.

29:05.494 --> 29:06.791
If the Cylon scanners
should pick you up...

29:06.870 --> 29:09.749
You will continue to rendezvous
with the survivors of the fleet.

29:09.831 --> 29:11.925
I'll take you
in my fighter.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.128
You're the last surviving
member of the Council, Father.

29:14.211 --> 29:17.340
If we should run into a Cylon attack
ship, at least you'll have a chance.

29:17.422 --> 29:19.675
I insist
on that, Commander.

29:21.927 --> 29:23.349
Very well.

29:26.515 --> 29:30.395
Core systems transferring control to probe craft.
Launch when ready.

29:40.404 --> 29:42.748
Ships are coming in
on both decks, sir.

29:43.865 --> 29:48.245
What's the count? Sixty seven
fighters in all, sir. 25 of our own.

29:48.870 --> 29:51.589
How many battlestars?
None.

29:52.499 --> 29:53.716
What?

29:55.335 --> 29:58.134
We're the only
surviving battlestar.

30:01.383 --> 30:02.726
My God.

30:05.387 --> 30:08.482
<i>Red Leader One in trouble.
Repeat, in trouble.</i>

30:08.557 --> 30:10.855
We read you, Red Leader.
How can we assist you?

30:10.934 --> 30:14.609
<i>I'm battle damaged. Power control
circuits shot away on my landing gear.</i>

30:15.022 --> 30:17.116
I'm on the line, Starbuck.
What's your condition?

30:17.524 --> 30:19.822
<i>This is no time for trainees, Athena.
I'm in trouble.</i>

30:19.901 --> 30:21.494
<i>I mean, I'm in real trouble.</i>

30:21.570 --> 30:25.200
You will be if you keep talking like that.
How's your fuel?

30:25.282 --> 30:28.001
<i>Dry. All right. Run
the check with me.</i>

30:35.208 --> 30:38.712
Alpha circuit, close and
alternate to left servo circuit.

30:38.879 --> 30:42.133
<i>Alpha circuit closed, alternating
to left servo circuit.</i>

30:43.592 --> 30:46.766
<i>No response. My throttles
are still full open.</i>

30:53.393 --> 30:56.863
Omega C circuit. Close and alternate
to servo support circuit.

30:56.938 --> 30:59.657
<i>Alternating to servo
support circuit.</i>

31:00.817 --> 31:02.285
<i>Does not respond.</i>

31:03.278 --> 31:04.370
Bring him in full throttle.

31:04.446 --> 31:06.289
We'll shut down at the outer marker.
There's no choice.

31:06.365 --> 31:10.370
<i>I heard him. Get everyone out of the way.
I'm coming in hot.</i>

31:21.546 --> 31:22.889
You're cleared to land.

31:24.216 --> 31:25.217
<i>Roger.</i>

31:25.300 --> 31:27.268
<i>I hope you guys aren't
counting off for neatness.</i>

31:37.312 --> 31:38.939
He'll be coming in
like a missile.

31:47.239 --> 31:48.786
Stay back!
He could lose it.

31:55.831 --> 31:57.799
I told you to stay back!

31:58.875 --> 32:00.092
Starbuck!

32:00.168 --> 32:03.092
Get out fast! The ship
might blow any minute!

32:05.715 --> 32:08.434
Are you all right? Fine. Fine,
no thanks to your father.

32:08.510 --> 32:10.103
Here. Give it a good
wash, fellas.

32:10.178 --> 32:12.727
Get out of that wing. Blow that out!
Get that fire there!

32:13.140 --> 32:14.767
What are you saying
about my father?

32:14.850 --> 32:16.978
Do you realize what we've
just been through?

32:17.060 --> 32:19.313
Oh, yeah? You should have
seen how we spent our day.

32:19.396 --> 32:21.774
We managed to single-handedly
keep the Cylons off your neck

32:21.857 --> 32:23.484
while you took off
on a little cruise!

32:23.567 --> 32:26.286
Starbuck, don't you realize
what's happened?

32:26.361 --> 32:27.863
Oh, yeah, sure.
I realize what happened.

32:27.946 --> 32:30.574
You should see this baby from the air
when it takes off across the sky.

32:30.657 --> 32:34.457
It's a beautiful sight, beautiful,
unless it happens to be your base ship!

32:34.536 --> 32:36.254
Starbuck, listen to me!

32:37.080 --> 32:39.128
The Colonies are gone.

32:40.750 --> 32:42.172
All of them.

32:42.252 --> 32:44.471
What are you
talking about, gone?

33:48.902 --> 33:50.575
I'm sorry, Ila.

33:51.947 --> 33:54.166
I was never there
when it mattered.

33:55.158 --> 33:56.580
Never

34:00.121 --> 34:01.293
Women.

34:07.295 --> 34:10.174
This way. There
must be food somewhere.

34:10.882 --> 34:12.134
I'm hungry.

34:20.308 --> 34:21.525
Father?

34:23.812 --> 34:25.906
There are crowds coming.

34:25.981 --> 34:27.983
They probably saw
our ship land.

34:28.775 --> 34:32.496
I was just gathering
a few things here.

34:34.489 --> 34:36.161
This likeness
of you and Zac...

34:37.284 --> 34:38.536
Father, we can't stay.

34:54.134 --> 34:56.353
Maybe Mother wasn't here.

34:59.347 --> 35:00.724
No.

35:01.683 --> 35:03.356
No, she was here.

35:05.645 --> 35:07.022
She was here.

35:28.710 --> 35:32.305
Where were they?
Where were they?

35:33.131 --> 35:35.350
Where are the rest
of you fancy fliers?

35:35.425 --> 35:38.019
Where were you when they
killed the rest of us?

35:38.094 --> 35:39.516
What were you doing, boy?

35:39.596 --> 35:41.564
Wait! Wait!
Let him talk!

35:42.599 --> 35:46.229
I want to know where you were as well.
All of you.

35:47.270 --> 35:51.992
We waited. We watched and
prayed, and you never came.

35:53.902 --> 35:55.119
Most of us are dead.

35:58.323 --> 35:59.745
The fleet is all
but destroyed.

36:00.200 --> 36:01.668
But you're here.

36:02.327 --> 36:04.079
<i>From the
battlestar Galactica.</i>

36:04.329 --> 36:07.333
It survived?
Yes.

36:07.791 --> 36:12.718
What of the President, and the Council
of 12, and all the other Colonies?

36:12.796 --> 36:14.594
All destroyed.

36:15.632 --> 36:18.602
Commander Adama.
Yes, Serina.

36:19.094 --> 36:22.098
It's true, then.
We're defeated, doomed.

36:24.724 --> 36:26.943
Can I ride
in your ship, sir?

36:27.769 --> 36:29.942
Fighter planes are no
place for little boys.

36:30.397 --> 36:33.901
They're going to have to be if
our people are going to survive.

36:39.781 --> 36:41.283
We must fight back.

36:41.366 --> 36:43.710
Yes, we are going
to fight back.

36:43.785 --> 36:47.164
But not here, not now,
not in the Colonies.

36:47.455 --> 36:49.128
Not even in this
star system.

36:49.207 --> 36:52.962
Let the word go forth to every man, woman
and child who survived this holocaust.

36:53.712 --> 36:58.309
<i>Tell them to set sail at once in every
assorted vehicle that will carry them.</i>

37:08.184 --> 37:11.859
<i>And the word went forth
to every outpost of human existence</i>

37:11.938 --> 37:14.737
<i>and they came, the Aries,</i>

37:14.816 --> 37:17.114
<i>the Gemons, the Virgos,</i>

37:17.193 --> 37:21.243
<i>the Scorpios, the Pisceans,
and the Sagittarians.</i>

37:21.322 --> 37:25.702
<i>In all, 220 ships,
representing every colony,</i>

37:25.785 --> 37:28.254
<i>color and creed
in the star system.</i>

38:04.073 --> 38:07.327
<i>The human race
might have one more chance,</i>

38:07.410 --> 38:12.587
<i>but first it would have to survive
the Alliance, the elements,</i>

38:12.665 --> 38:16.386
<i>and the unknown dark and sinister
threats that would lie ahead.</i>

38:18.463 --> 38:20.807
Their destruction is complete.

38:20.882 --> 38:25.012
<i>Our forces have taken prisoners
near the spacedrome.</i>

38:25.094 --> 38:28.439
<i>They tell of survivors
who escaped in ships.</i>

38:28.515 --> 38:29.983
What ships?

38:31.059 --> 38:32.902
How far can they go?

38:33.561 --> 38:36.155
If a handful of survivors
did indeed escape,

38:36.231 --> 38:39.531
they would have neither fuel nor
food for a prolonged voyage.

38:39.609 --> 38:42.704
<i>The information
is not complete.</i>

38:42.779 --> 38:45.532
<i>It is offered
in exchange for life.</i>

38:45.615 --> 38:48.494
And what is the standing order for
humans from your imperious leader?

38:48.576 --> 38:50.294
<i>Extermination.</i>

38:50.370 --> 38:52.122
Then carry out
your orders.

38:52.205 --> 38:55.709
If they exist,
they're doomed.

39:14.435 --> 39:18.690
We gather here as representatives
of each ship in our fleet

39:18.773 --> 39:21.526
to answer
that single question.

39:21.609 --> 39:23.111
Where will we go?

39:24.112 --> 39:29.744
Our recorded history tells us that we
descended from a mother civilization,

39:29.826 --> 39:33.126
a race that went out into
space to establish colonies.

39:33.705 --> 39:39.178
Those of us here assembled now represent
the only known surviving colonies.

39:39.627 --> 39:44.724
Save one, a sister world,
far out in the universe,

39:44.799 --> 39:48.520
remembered to us only
through ancient writings.

39:48.595 --> 39:52.316
It is my intention to seek
out that remaining colony,

39:52.390 --> 39:55.564
that last outpost of humanity
in the whole universe.

39:55.643 --> 39:57.065
Commander Adama?

39:58.521 --> 40:01.491
This 13th colony,
this other world,

40:02.108 --> 40:04.577
where is it,
and what is it called?

40:05.278 --> 40:08.748
I wish I could tell you that I
know precisely where it is,

40:08.823 --> 40:10.450
but I can't.

40:10.533 --> 40:14.254
However, I do know that it
lies beyond our star system,

40:14.329 --> 40:18.880
in a galaxy very much like
our own, on a planet called

40:20.668 --> 40:21.920
Earth.

40:22.003 --> 40:23.676
Earth?

40:41.356 --> 40:44.030
<i>Flight Leader Serpentine,
by your command.</i>

40:44.108 --> 40:46.782
Report, Centurion,
on the final assault.

40:46.861 --> 40:50.786
<i>On each of the 12 planets
a similar story is told</i>

40:50.865 --> 40:53.584
<i>of a handful of ships
who escaped destruction</i>

40:53.660 --> 40:55.378
<i>to rendezvous
with a warship.</i>

40:55.453 --> 40:56.875
What kind of warship?

40:56.955 --> 40:58.878
<i>A battlestar called Galactica.</i>

40:58.957 --> 41:02.587
Then go and seek out Baltar.
Tell him I'm displeased.

41:02.669 --> 41:06.970
Tell him I offer a choice.
Deliver the battlestar <i>Galactica</i>

41:08.049 --> 41:09.551
or deliver his head.

41:35.034 --> 41:37.503
<i>This is Alpha shuttle
approaching freighter Gemini</i>

41:37.578 --> 41:40.001
<i>for fleet damage
and supply survey.</i>

41:40.081 --> 41:42.209
<i>Please prepare to receive.</i>

41:43.084 --> 41:44.427
Ah, look at it
this way, Boomer.

41:44.502 --> 41:47.551
It isn't the worst duty in the
fleet, asking a lot of questions.

41:48.214 --> 41:50.763
I hear they're sending some
poor guys from Beta section

41:50.842 --> 41:52.936
crawling around on the
outside of an old skybus

41:53.011 --> 41:54.354
looking for a solium leak.

41:54.429 --> 41:56.978
Mmm, wonder how they
missed us for that detail.

41:57.598 --> 41:59.225
Excuse me, but...
Shh.

41:59.851 --> 42:02.229
Would you mind telling us
what you're looking for?

42:02.311 --> 42:03.437
Solium leaks.

42:05.815 --> 42:08.034
Bye.
Halt!

42:10.945 --> 42:12.197
Among;

42:14.282 --> 42:16.660
Captain, that stuff
is dangerous.

42:16.743 --> 42:19.587
I mean, these old ships
shouldn't even be flying.

42:19.662 --> 42:22.131
There really wasn't
much choice, was there?

42:22.206 --> 42:25.050
How many people did we leave
behind for lack of ships?

42:25.126 --> 42:28.221
Now, unless you're willing to volunteer
permanent assignment on this tub,

42:28.296 --> 42:31.425
you'll help survey each and every
ship in this fleet for damage,

42:31.507 --> 42:34.511
or I just might be tempted to loan
you guys out to Beta company.

42:37.055 --> 42:41.151
Just keep it up, old buddy. You're
going to get us into real trouble.

42:41.934 --> 42:44.528
Ten thousand light years
from nowhere,

42:44.604 --> 42:46.698
our planet's shot to pieces,
people starving,

42:46.773 --> 42:47.899
and I'm going
to get us in trouble?

42:47.982 --> 42:50.201
Look, all I'm saying...
What is the matter with you?

42:50.276 --> 42:51.949
I tell you!

42:52.028 --> 42:54.030
We may as well
live for today.

42:54.113 --> 42:55.911
We might not have many left.

43:18.763 --> 43:19.935
Apollo?

43:20.556 --> 43:22.684
Yeah, I see it.

43:23.017 --> 43:24.610
Where's the food?

43:24.685 --> 43:26.653
Everything's gonna be taken care of.
Just be patient.

43:26.729 --> 43:29.448
But where's the water? We
haven't had water in two days.

43:29.565 --> 43:31.567
We'll have food and water...
But what's happening?

43:31.651 --> 43:34.245
But you promised us water!
Just get us a little water.

43:34.320 --> 43:37.449
Can't you bring us some water down here?
A little bit?

43:37.532 --> 43:39.705
We just need
a little bit of water!

43:39.784 --> 43:41.161
Where's the food?

43:41.244 --> 43:43.918
Why haven't we seen or heard
from anyone in two days?

43:43.996 --> 43:46.749
Please. Please, tell us
what's going on.

43:46.874 --> 43:50.253
Have we been left behind? No,
you haven't been left behind.

43:50.336 --> 43:52.555
Be patient. Your needs
will be attended to.

43:52.630 --> 43:54.758
Be patient. Just be
glad you're alive.

43:59.637 --> 44:01.389
It's Gemonese.
Boomer can translate.

44:01.472 --> 44:03.440
Boomer's tied up.
Anyone here who can help?

44:03.516 --> 44:05.939
Does anyone here
understand Gemonese?

44:06.018 --> 44:08.237
The woman said
her husband is feverish.

44:08.312 --> 44:10.155
What's wrong
with your arm?

44:10.231 --> 44:11.824
There are others
in greater need than I.

44:11.899 --> 44:13.742
Get her out of here.

44:14.360 --> 44:18.706
She should be jettisoned with the dead.
No place for refuse here.

44:21.242 --> 44:23.244
Feed her
to the daggits!

44:24.912 --> 44:26.789
Dirty socialator.

44:28.082 --> 44:31.461
It's a sin to starve us while
the bureauticians luxuriate

44:31.544 --> 44:33.046
in their
private sanctuaries.

44:33.129 --> 44:34.972
No one is in luxury,
I promise you that.

44:35.047 --> 44:36.515
No, you're lying.

44:36.591 --> 44:40.186
I saw it with my own eyes
aboard the <i>Rising</i> Star

44:40.261 --> 44:44.266
before I was cast out and put here
among the Borays of humanity.

44:48.394 --> 44:51.068
Core Control is
aware of the problem.

44:51.147 --> 44:52.865
So I can tell them food
and water is on the way?

44:52.940 --> 44:55.784
They're aware
of the problem.

44:55.860 --> 44:59.615
What are you saying? There's
something you're not telling us.

45:00.323 --> 45:03.873
Relief is on the way. You
have my word as a Warrior.

45:03.951 --> 45:06.955
Your word as a Warrior?

45:08.164 --> 45:10.292
<i>You know, I can't</i>
<i>fault them for resenting us-</i>

45:10.374 --> 45:13.378
<i>They lost everything.
They have to blame someone.</i>

45:16.339 --> 45:18.137
Core Command, this is
Alpha Shuttle requesting

45:18.216 --> 45:20.469
clarification
on food dispersal.

45:20.551 --> 45:23.976
Core Command. No information
available at this time.

45:24.138 --> 45:25.765
What are you talking about "no
information is available"?

45:25.848 --> 45:29.569
I just left a ship filled with starving people.
What's going on?

45:29.644 --> 45:31.396
I'm sorry, Shuttle Alpha.

45:31.479 --> 45:34.949
Core Command has no information
available at this time.

45:41.280 --> 45:44.033
Commander, this is
Colonel Tigh.

45:44.992 --> 45:46.619
It's starting.

45:48.037 --> 45:49.755
Something's wrong.

45:49.830 --> 45:52.174
What did they tell you when you
called in the food shortage?

45:52.250 --> 45:54.252
The same thing
they told you,

45:54.335 --> 45:56.838
a vague acknowledgment
of the problem.

46:00.925 --> 46:03.974
Boomer, I'm getting
an awful uneasy feeling.

46:04.345 --> 46:07.645
Why don't you just give me
your name, okay?

46:08.849 --> 46:10.522
It's all right.

46:11.560 --> 46:13.813
My name is Cassiopeia.

46:13.896 --> 46:16.775
Cassiopeia. It's beautiful.

46:17.525 --> 46:21.701
it means "fairy queen," doesn't it?
I think so.

46:22.280 --> 46:23.623
Designation?

46:26.617 --> 46:28.540
I'm designated a socialator.

46:30.288 --> 46:31.835
It's an
honorable profession,

46:31.914 --> 46:35.259
practiced with the blessings of
the elders for over 4,000 years.

46:35.334 --> 46:37.211
I didn't say anything.

46:38.796 --> 46:42.391
I was just curious about what all that
excitement was about back on the barge.

46:43.259 --> 46:44.727
That woman...

46:45.553 --> 46:49.603
That woman is a member of the
Otori Sect amongst the Gemonese.

46:50.474 --> 46:54.479
They don't believe in physical
contact between genders,

46:54.562 --> 46:59.739
except when sanctified by the priest
during high worship of the sun storm,

46:59.817 --> 47:02.661
which comes once only
every seven years.

47:05.031 --> 47:08.160
No wonder those little buggers
are such good card players.

47:10.202 --> 47:12.045
Core Command,
this is Alpha Shuttle.

47:12.121 --> 47:15.000
Changing course to rendezvous
with starliner <i>Rising Star.</i>

47:15.082 --> 47:18.177
Shuttle will proceed on to <i>Galactica</i>
with patients for life station.

47:18.252 --> 47:21.973
Hey, what are you up to?
If you don't mind my asking, sir.

47:22.048 --> 47:25.097
I want to see what's at the bottom
of this conspiracy of silence.

47:25.426 --> 47:27.349
<i>Passenger liner Rising Star,</i>

47:27.428 --> 47:29.851
<i>this is Sigma Shuttle on fleet
damage and supply survey.</i>

47:29.930 --> 47:31.056
<i>Prepare to receive.</i>

47:32.141 --> 47:35.520
Contaminated? Weren't the provisions
checked before they were boarded?

47:35.603 --> 47:39.699
For radiation, yes. There wasn't
time to check for pluton poisoning.

47:39.774 --> 47:42.744
Pluton breaks down the structure of food.
All of this is worthless?

47:42.818 --> 47:44.661
We don't know that yet.

47:44.737 --> 47:47.115
Jolly, have your crews go
through every container.

47:47.198 --> 47:50.042
Chances are some of it was shielded
enough from the bombs to be saved.

47:50.117 --> 47:52.791
We went through three ships since last night.
It isn't looking good.

47:52.870 --> 47:56.545
Salvage anything you can.
Even small scraps will help.

47:56.624 --> 47:58.922
What do we do
with the rest of it?

47:59.794 --> 48:01.341
Jettison it.

48:02.004 --> 48:03.176
Keep a lid on the problem.

48:03.255 --> 48:04.723
If people find out
we haven't any food,

48:04.799 --> 48:06.346
we're gonna have
a mutiny on our hands.

48:06.425 --> 48:07.768
We're going up
to the second level.

48:15.476 --> 48:16.477
Captain!

48:17.812 --> 48:20.565
Yes? I heard that
you'd come aboard.

48:20.648 --> 48:23.071
I wonder if I might
borrow you for a moment?

48:23.150 --> 48:25.903
I'm afraid we're on an important
survey for the Commander right now.

48:25.986 --> 48:27.909
It won't take very long.

48:29.323 --> 48:30.666
Boomer, why don't you
go up to elite class

48:30.741 --> 48:33.085
and see if there's anything going
on we should be concerned about?

48:33.160 --> 48:35.083
You won't like
what you find.

48:35.162 --> 48:37.130
I'll be along presently.

48:38.666 --> 48:40.589
It's my son.

48:42.628 --> 48:45.006
He hasn't moved in two days.

48:45.506 --> 48:48.806
He lost a little daggit which
meant everything to him.

48:48.884 --> 48:50.761
I thought you might
be able to help.

48:50.845 --> 48:52.939
If he won't eat for you,
I don't know what I can do.

48:53.013 --> 48:57.018
Well, he seemed to spark a little
when you picked him up on Caprica.

48:57.101 --> 49:00.446
I got the feeling that you
were good with children.

49:00.521 --> 49:02.774
I grew up
with a kid brother.

49:02.857 --> 49:05.201
Where is he?
There.

49:14.994 --> 49:19.591
Excuse me. I'm in charge of finding young
men to try out as future fighter pilots.

49:19.665 --> 49:21.042
Your name is?

49:22.084 --> 49:24.382
Boxey.
Boxey.

49:25.379 --> 49:26.722
Okay.

49:28.048 --> 49:30.142
Just what I thought. You're
right at the top of my list.

49:30.217 --> 49:31.969
You know I've been
looking all over for you?

49:32.052 --> 49:33.770
You should have made contact
with the Commander.

49:33.846 --> 49:35.723
We're very short
on fighter pilots.

49:35.806 --> 49:37.729
I'm too little
to be a pilot.

49:38.434 --> 49:39.731
Oh, sure, right now.

49:39.810 --> 49:43.064
But how long do you think it takes
to become a full Colonial Warrior?

49:43.189 --> 49:45.112
I don't know.

49:45.191 --> 49:47.660
Well, you have to start
when you're very small,

49:47.735 --> 49:50.488
or you won't get these
until you have gray hair.

49:50.571 --> 49:53.040
You like them?
I want Muff it.

49:55.367 --> 49:58.962
Well, I don't know. There's not much
room for a daggit in a fighter plane.

49:59.038 --> 50:01.257
He's gone. He ran away.

50:02.458 --> 50:03.550
Oh.

50:05.044 --> 50:06.341
Well, um...

50:08.088 --> 50:10.682
Well, maybe we can find
one of Muff it's friends.

50:10.758 --> 50:13.602
I asked.
There are no daggits.

50:20.226 --> 50:22.649
Well, I'll tell you what.

50:22.728 --> 50:25.026
As a Colonial Warrior,
first level,

50:25.105 --> 50:28.405
you are entitled to the first
daggit that comes along, okay?

50:28.859 --> 50:32.329
But only on the condition
that you get your rest,

50:33.989 --> 50:35.707
close your eyes,

50:38.160 --> 50:40.083
eat all your primaries...

50:40.454 --> 50:41.797
Shh.

50:44.375 --> 50:46.298
And stop chasing girls.

50:48.587 --> 50:49.964
Thank you.

50:51.131 --> 50:53.725
I was right. You are
good with kids.

50:54.301 --> 50:57.054
You and your brother
must be very close.

50:57.638 --> 50:59.106
We were.

50:59.181 --> 51:00.774
Oh, I'm sorry.

51:02.476 --> 51:04.353
If you'd rather
not be involved...

51:04.436 --> 51:08.157
Hey, don't be silly. What's a Warrior
to do after he's lost the big one?

51:08.232 --> 51:09.825
Win a few of the little ones.

51:15.781 --> 51:19.706
That's not a little one
in there, Captain. No.

51:24.123 --> 51:27.502
Just once, to step aside...
This is a private accommodation

51:27.585 --> 51:30.054
secured by Sire Uri
and his party.

51:30.129 --> 51:32.973
I'm being paid
by Trans Stellar's...

51:33.048 --> 51:34.550
Now.

51:34.675 --> 51:38.145
Hey, what's going on, Boomer?
Oh, nothing, nothing.

51:38.220 --> 51:42.566
Just the fella here didn't seem to
wanna let us into the club area.

51:44.685 --> 51:46.028
Thank you.

51:48.063 --> 51:49.406
Thank you.

51:50.441 --> 51:53.991
I trust you have an explanation
for this intrusion?

51:56.947 --> 52:00.042
Would you like to make a statement
before I arrest you, Sire Uri?

52:00.159 --> 52:03.629
I'm glad
you know my name.

52:03.704 --> 52:06.082
At least you know from
where the blade fell.

52:06.415 --> 52:09.635
I'm gonna give you about a
micron to join me on my shuttle.

52:09.710 --> 52:13.089
After that, I'll just turn the six levels
of starving passengers beneath you loose

52:13.172 --> 52:14.640
and let you take your
chances with them.

52:14.715 --> 52:20.142
Captain, why don't you join us in our
prayer of gratitude for deliverance?

52:20.220 --> 52:22.393
In case it eluded you,
Councilor,

52:22.473 --> 52:26.068
some 100 people have died since
our deliverance from the Cylons.

52:26.393 --> 52:31.069
And while hunger hasn't yet taken a
life, it's only a matter of time now.

52:32.733 --> 52:34.986
Boomer, notify Core Command that
we have located some stores

52:35.069 --> 52:37.788
which we will distribute
as far as they go.

52:37.863 --> 52:42.744
No, it's mine! it belongs
to me and my guests.

52:45.329 --> 52:48.833
Does your wife share your feelings
about denying your food to others?

52:48.916 --> 52:50.008
My wife?

52:50.709 --> 52:52.302
Stress Uri.
I don't see her.

52:54.171 --> 52:57.345
Unfortunately, she was not
in time to make the voyage.

53:01.595 --> 53:04.974
My sympathies.
I share your bereavement.

53:05.432 --> 53:09.107
Stress Uri was an
outstanding woman. Yes.

53:10.020 --> 53:12.523
I'm sure she'd be moved
by your period of mourning.

53:15.693 --> 53:17.036
Boomer, have Jolly
come up here with the crew

53:17.111 --> 53:18.909
and distribute this food
throughout the ship.

53:33.377 --> 53:34.799
Without being
critical, Captain,

53:34.878 --> 53:37.722
wouldn't you say you overplayed
our hand just a tad?

53:37.798 --> 53:42.770
Considering Sire Uri is a member of
the newly elected Council of the 12.

53:42.845 --> 53:45.143
How do you
overplay starvation?

53:56.191 --> 53:57.909
How does it feel?

53:57.985 --> 54:00.329
Feels like
it's never even been broken.

54:06.535 --> 54:08.754
The bone's been fused whole.

54:08.829 --> 54:10.923
It's stronger than before.

54:13.792 --> 54:15.339
It's wonderful.

54:20.215 --> 54:21.842
Ooh!

54:21.925 --> 54:24.269
Look, look!

54:25.846 --> 54:28.065
Look at my arm!

54:30.601 --> 54:32.729
You're waiting to take
me back, aren't you?

54:32.811 --> 54:35.735
Well, it isn't easy to
find a ride around here.

54:35.814 --> 54:38.988
I dread returning
to that ship.

54:39.067 --> 54:41.616
Look, maybe I can
check around

54:41.695 --> 54:44.118
and see if there's
anyplace else you can go.

54:44.198 --> 54:46.041
There are better ships.

54:46.825 --> 54:50.295
Would you be doing this
if I weren't a socialator?

54:50.370 --> 54:54.796
Hey, listen, can we forget my little
jokes back on the shuttle, huh?

54:54.875 --> 54:56.218
Look, I...

54:56.919 --> 54:58.967
I just want to help you.

54:59.630 --> 55:02.179
Really, it's nothing personal.

55:03.133 --> 55:04.555
Nothing personal?

55:04.635 --> 55:06.979
No. Absolutely nothing.

55:07.054 --> 55:09.056
Really?
I swear.

55:09.598 --> 55:12.522
Okay! Okay!

55:14.019 --> 55:16.818
But I think you're
making a terrible deal.

55:24.780 --> 55:27.158
Long-range patrol
is reporting in.

55:32.579 --> 55:35.207
<i>Scanners show no sign
of Cylon pursuit.</i>

55:35.749 --> 55:37.626
<i>All vectors looking good.</i>

55:37.709 --> 55:40.087
Commander.
Yes, I heard.

55:41.255 --> 55:42.973
That's good news.

55:43.674 --> 55:45.642
Apparently, we've made
good our escape.

55:45.717 --> 55:50.268
Finding us now would be almost impossible,
assuming we don't make any mistakes.

55:50.430 --> 55:52.649
Carillon is too far away.

55:53.267 --> 55:56.612
We will never make it because
of the food disaster.

55:56.854 --> 55:59.073
There is
no other destination.

55:59.147 --> 56:00.945
Ah, but there is.

56:01.608 --> 56:05.579
We can stop here
on Borallus.

56:08.073 --> 56:11.452
We know that everything
we need is there.

56:11.535 --> 56:14.835
Food, fuel and water.

56:14.913 --> 56:18.087
And undoubtedly,
a Cylon task force.

56:18.166 --> 56:20.715
It is the most logical
place for us to stop.

56:20.794 --> 56:22.467
Precisely why I believe
it will be fatal.

56:23.130 --> 56:25.383
- Hey, where are you going?
- Possibly fatal.

56:25.465 --> 56:28.969
Is it not surely fatal
to continue towards Carillon?

56:29.052 --> 56:30.395
There is another way,

56:30.721 --> 56:32.940
if I may have a few moments
of the Council's time.

56:33.015 --> 56:36.519
I support Commander Adama's
rejection of Borallus.

56:36.602 --> 56:38.354
Surprising.

56:38.437 --> 56:42.032
It is a deathtrap as lethal
as the one we left behind,

56:42.107 --> 56:44.610
and we haven't the armament
to fight our way in and out.

56:45.068 --> 56:48.447
However, there is another
approach to Carillon.

56:49.698 --> 56:54.499
Instead of using the intended route,
which takes us centons out of our way,

56:55.370 --> 57:00.342
I suggest we take the direct path,
here, through the Nova of Madagon.

57:01.585 --> 57:05.089
Not patrolled and a savings of
centons in reaching Carillon.

57:05.380 --> 57:07.758
Captain, I may not be
a military expert,

57:07.841 --> 57:13.189
but I do know that the Cylons don't
have to patrol that particular area

57:13.263 --> 57:17.860
because they mine it. They lay
mines to make passage impossible.

57:17.935 --> 57:20.609
It would be impossible for a fleet
of cumbersome ships like ours

57:20.687 --> 57:23.531
to even attempt to go through
that narrow passage.

57:23.607 --> 57:28.738
I agree. The fleet could not traverse the
channel unless it had been cleared first.

57:28.820 --> 57:31.323
And how would you
propose doing that?

57:33.700 --> 57:36.123
Well, I suggest I find
one or two volunteers

57:36.203 --> 57:39.457
to join me in flying ahead
of the fleet in fighter craft

57:39.539 --> 57:42.418
to blow the minefield apart
with laser torpedoes.

57:42.501 --> 57:44.754
Good idea.
Two volunteers?

57:44.836 --> 57:46.930
Out of the question!
Out of the question!

57:47.005 --> 57:48.928
Brilliant, brilliant.

57:49.007 --> 57:53.934
If you must go straight ahead as you
insist, Adama, then this is the way.

57:54.012 --> 57:55.935
I say we support the Captain.

57:56.014 --> 57:58.267
Good for you.
Good for you, my boy.

57:58.350 --> 58:02.025
As grave a plan as it is, it
appears to be our only hope.

58:02.104 --> 58:06.575
You have the support and the
blessing of the Council of the 12.

58:08.568 --> 58:10.115
Thank you.

58:14.282 --> 58:17.832
Guess who he's got in mind to
volunteer for that. Hey, wait.

58:17.911 --> 58:19.913
I'm getting out of here.

58:21.415 --> 58:24.635
Well, just the two fellows
I wanted to see.

58:24.710 --> 58:26.383
Follow me, gentlemen.

58:26.461 --> 58:28.930
See? I told you.
Right.

58:38.432 --> 58:39.854
He still won't eat.

58:39.933 --> 58:42.402
I think we may have found
something that's going to interest him.

58:42.477 --> 58:44.980
Tonight? Shouldn't you
be getting some rest?

58:45.063 --> 58:48.363
I'll sleep better after
we solve Boxey's problem.

58:48.442 --> 58:51.161
That's a tall order.
I'm a big boy.

58:53.613 --> 58:55.240
Okay, Boxey.

58:59.327 --> 59:01.625
You're going
to love this, Boxey.

59:02.289 --> 59:07.295
As you know, we will soon be
landing on various alien planets.

59:07.961 --> 59:10.714
It's important
that we be safe.

59:11.298 --> 59:15.019
Ordinarily, we'd use trained
daggits to stand watch at night

59:15.093 --> 59:18.267
while our Warriors slept
in their encampments.

59:18.847 --> 59:21.020
But we didn't have
any daggits.

59:21.099 --> 59:24.148
So we just had to see
what we could come up with.

59:24.227 --> 59:27.822
We'll call the first
one Muff it ll.

59:52.631 --> 59:56.681
Naturally, the first one will have
to be very carefully looked after.

59:57.677 --> 01:00:01.056
That's not Muff it.
It's not even a real daggit.

01:00:01.515 --> 01:00:05.691
No, but he can learn to be like a real one.
He's very smart.

01:00:06.019 --> 01:00:09.273
And if you would help us,
he can be even smarter.

01:00:10.148 --> 01:00:11.525
Stop that.

01:00:18.115 --> 01:00:22.871
We used the image of Boxey you gave us
to train the drone to respond to him.

01:00:30.752 --> 01:00:34.052
I owe you one, Doc.
Any time.

01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:42.063
That's one I owe you.

01:00:47.352 --> 01:00:48.820
Call it even.

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:02.583
It's somehow beautiful.

01:01:03.243 --> 01:01:04.916
It's a perfect machine.

01:01:06.913 --> 01:01:09.757
Born to dance
amongst the stars.

01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:12.803
Yeah, it's bumping into them
that has me worried.

01:01:13.962 --> 01:01:16.306
Why did
you volunteer, Starbuck?

01:01:16.882 --> 01:01:19.180
Well, somebody had to do it.

01:01:19.259 --> 01:01:21.057
Did Apollo make you?

01:01:21.136 --> 01:01:26.108
Yes, you certainly have a way of
cutting through the felgercarb.

01:01:27.642 --> 01:01:31.237
Do you ever take that smoldering
weed out of your mouth?

01:01:41.114 --> 01:01:44.118
You know, I had this wonderful
speech all prepared.

01:01:44.409 --> 01:01:46.537
About this being
your last night here,

01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:51.217
about possibly not seeing another
night as beautiful as this one

01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:54.845
or another girl as beautiful
as lam ever again?

01:01:56.296 --> 01:02:00.051
Well, that speech is a little
better than the one I had.

01:02:00.133 --> 01:02:03.137
Would you mind if I borrowed
it on some future occasion?

01:02:07.641 --> 01:02:11.145
Uh, listen, do you mind if we
don't spend too much more time

01:02:11.228 --> 01:02:12.400
in the launching bay?

01:02:13.897 --> 01:02:15.991
Well, can you think
of any place more private?

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:18.197
Uh... Come to think of it,

01:02:18.276 --> 01:02:20.699
I can't think of any place
private in the whole damn fleet.

01:02:23.323 --> 01:02:26.247
What's in there?
That's the launching tube.

01:02:26.326 --> 01:02:27.623
You don't want
to go in there.

01:02:27.702 --> 01:02:30.205
It's dark and cold,
and it's a...

01:02:35.335 --> 01:02:37.258
Oh, Lord, I'll do anything
you ask tomorrow,

01:02:37.337 --> 01:02:39.840
just don't call
an alert tonight.

01:02:50.934 --> 01:02:54.029
Colonel, have you seen Lieutenant
Starbuck by any chance?

01:02:54.104 --> 01:02:55.777
No, I don't think I...

01:02:55.855 --> 01:02:58.734
Wait, I did see him on one
of the monitors earlier.

01:02:58.817 --> 01:03:01.866
Before we shut down the flight deck, I
think he was checking out his ship.

01:03:01.945 --> 01:03:03.367
Hmm. That would seem
to make sense.

01:03:03.446 --> 01:03:04.663
I'm sure
he's long gone by now

01:03:04.739 --> 01:03:06.616
and getting a good night's
sleep for the mission.

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:10.204
Why don't you do the same?
You are going to be working.

01:03:32.892 --> 01:03:34.565
That little snake.

01:03:53.038 --> 01:03:55.962
The Nova of Madagon
is not a nova at all

01:03:56.041 --> 01:03:58.214
but a starfield so bright,

01:03:58.293 --> 01:04:01.172
our cockpits will be sealed
to prevent blindness.

01:04:01.254 --> 01:04:02.506
We'll navigate by scanner

01:04:02.589 --> 01:04:04.591
and sweep everything out of
our path with turbo lasers.

01:04:07.302 --> 01:04:09.020
You feeling all right,
Starbuck?

01:04:09.095 --> 01:04:11.097
You're fidgeting around
like a daggit on a sunspot.

01:04:11.181 --> 01:04:13.058
Well, It's my
bio-pulse line, sir.

01:04:13.141 --> 01:04:15.690
It's a bad time for me
to be cooped up in a cockpit.

01:04:15.769 --> 01:04:17.567
Starbuck's being polite.

01:04:17.645 --> 01:04:19.613
Seems he got a steam burn.

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:21.737
I don't think I want to
ask you how you got it,

01:04:21.816 --> 01:04:24.319
because I need you
on this mission.

01:04:24.694 --> 01:04:28.119
I didn't choose you to help lead us
through without a great deal of anguish.

01:04:28.365 --> 01:04:31.289
If it'll do any good, let me
assure you that should we fail,

01:04:31.368 --> 01:04:32.745
no one will survive.

01:04:33.119 --> 01:04:36.840
The rest of our friends must sit
in anticipation of our skill.

01:04:40.794 --> 01:04:42.637
Or lack thereof.

01:04:43.671 --> 01:04:46.174
Ready?
Ready.

01:04:48.593 --> 01:04:49.640
<i>Starbuck?</i>

01:04:49.719 --> 01:04:52.643
I'm not ready,
but let's get it over with.

01:05:01.981 --> 01:05:03.449
Nova starfield ahead.

01:05:03.525 --> 01:05:07.325
...on three, two, one.
We've got <i>it</i> on...

01:05:07.404 --> 01:05:09.452
Radiation shield positive.

01:05:11.408 --> 01:05:13.376
Launch fighters now.

01:05:33.972 --> 01:05:37.693
<i>Skin temperature readout.
1-0-0 and rising.</i>

01:05:46.192 --> 01:05:48.661
<i>We may not be able to see anything,
but it's sure getting hot.</i>

01:05:48.987 --> 01:05:50.614
<i>Anybody picking up
the field on the scanner?</i>

01:05:50.697 --> 01:05:52.574
<i>Negative.
My scanner's burning up.</i>

01:05:52.699 --> 01:05:53.996
<i>Mine's gone.</i>

01:05:54.075 --> 01:05:56.828
<i>I was afraid of that.
It's too bright for the scanner.</i>

01:05:57.370 --> 01:06:00.965
Core systems transferring control
from probe craft to <i>Galactica.</i>

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:03.463
<i>We will guide you through
using scanners.</i>

01:06:03.543 --> 01:06:04.840
<i>What if we miss a mine?</i>

01:06:05.295 --> 01:06:07.673
<i>One of us will be
the first to know.</i>

01:06:07.755 --> 01:06:09.098
<i>Let's go.</i>

01:06:14.554 --> 01:06:15.897
<i>We'll talk
you through.</i>

01:06:15.972 --> 01:06:17.394
<i>Countdown to fire.</i>

01:06:17.474 --> 01:06:20.193
<i>Five, four, three...</i>

01:06:23.396 --> 01:06:24.739
<i>Three degrees right.</i>

01:06:28.485 --> 01:06:29.782
<i>Target destroyed.</i>

01:06:29.861 --> 01:06:30.987
<i>One target coming up.</i>

01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:32.492
<i>It's burning
through my canopy.</i>

01:06:32.572 --> 01:06:33.824
<i>...four, three...</i>

01:06:33.907 --> 01:06:34.999
<i>Just keep firing!</i>

01:06:35.074 --> 01:06:36.576
...one, fire.

01:06:40.413 --> 01:06:41.585
<i>And fire.</i>

01:06:51.257 --> 01:06:56.354
<i>Heartbeat, Lieutenant Boomer, readout 1-0-0.
Other functions normal.</i>

01:06:56.429 --> 01:07:00.809
It's working, Commander. They're
clearing a path 100 maxims wide.

01:07:01.976 --> 01:07:03.649
Now that is
precision flying.

01:07:04.312 --> 01:07:06.656
<i>I can't see a blessed thing.
Are we hitting anything?</i>

01:07:06.731 --> 01:07:07.948
<i>I'll be hanged if I know.</i>

01:07:10.318 --> 01:07:12.195
<i>...two, one, fire.</i>

01:07:16.783 --> 01:07:19.912
<i>Heartbeat,
Captain Apollo, readout, 9-9.</i>

01:07:19.994 --> 01:07:22.873
<i>Skin temperature

01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:28.129
<i>Skin temperature

01:07:30.255 --> 01:07:31.802
<i>Five, four...</i>

01:07:31.881 --> 01:07:33.349
<i>It's getting hot.</i>

01:07:33.424 --> 01:07:35.426
<i>...two, one, fire.</i>

01:07:38.096 --> 01:07:39.188
<i>Fire.</i>

01:07:41.599 --> 01:07:42.691
<i>Fire.</i>

01:07:47.981 --> 01:07:50.985
<i>Heartbeat,

01:07:51.442 --> 01:07:55.948
<i>Skin temperature

01:08:01.369 --> 01:08:02.461
<i>It's cooling off.</i>

01:08:03.871 --> 01:08:05.919
Let's take a look
at where we are.

01:08:05.999 --> 01:08:07.592
Negative shield, now.

01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:15.224
There it is. Carillon.

01:08:16.175 --> 01:08:17.267
<i>I think we're going
to make it.</i>

01:08:17.844 --> 01:08:19.767
<i>Yee-ha!</i>

01:08:36.821 --> 01:08:38.368
Recall the flight crews.

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:48.921
The planet Carillon. Landing
operations will begin at once.

01:08:49.834 --> 01:08:53.884
Prepare to land the mineral
ships and the Landram parties.

01:08:55.006 --> 01:08:56.724
<i>Our mineral scanners
have located</i>

01:08:56.799 --> 01:09:00.645
<i>what we believe is the approximate
site of the old mining expedition.</i>

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:04.064
<i>Blue Squadron will vector
in the ground search teams.</i>

01:09:21.491 --> 01:09:24.495
Welcome, Baltar.
I have grave news.

01:09:24.577 --> 01:09:29.504
A handful of Colonials prevail,
but we will soon find them.

01:09:29.999 --> 01:09:32.421
What of our bargain?
My colony was to be spared!

01:09:32.502 --> 01:09:34.675
I now alter the bargain.

01:09:35.129 --> 01:09:37.723
How can you change
one side of a bargain?

01:09:37.799 --> 01:09:40.176
When there is
no other side.

01:09:40.259 --> 01:09:43.559
You have missed the
entire point of the war.

01:09:44.639 --> 01:09:47.939
But I have no ambitions
against you.

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:50.023
Could you think me
so foolish

01:09:50.103 --> 01:09:53.698
as to trust a man who would
see his own race destroyed?

01:09:53.898 --> 01:09:56.868
Not destroyed, subjugated.
Under me.

01:09:56.943 --> 01:09:59.116
There can be no survivors.

01:09:59.612 --> 01:10:04.288
So long as one human remains
alive, the Alliance is threatened.

01:10:06.035 --> 01:10:10.131
Surely, you don't mean me.

01:10:10.581 --> 01:10:13.255
We thank you
for your help, Baltar.

01:10:13.334 --> 01:10:15.257
Your time is at an end.

01:10:15.336 --> 01:10:17.088
No! You can't!

01:10:18.172 --> 01:10:19.264
You still need me...

01:10:22.802 --> 01:10:25.726
<i>Victor 6-3-0-3-8
to Ground Expedition 2.</i>

01:10:26.139 --> 01:10:29.393
<i>My scanners read life-forms
beyond these coordinates.</i>

01:10:29.475 --> 01:10:31.352
<i>Either it's some high
energy-yielding substance,</i>

01:10:31.436 --> 01:10:33.438
<i>or they left some kind of
caretaker operation behind</i>

01:10:33.521 --> 01:10:34.773
<i>when they abandoned
this place.</i>

01:10:34.856 --> 01:10:37.279
<i>We've got it, 0-3-8.
Thanks a lot.</i>

01:10:37.358 --> 01:10:39.156
<i>I wonder what this
looks like in the daytime.</i>

01:10:40.486 --> 01:10:42.784
Hey. This is the daytime.

01:10:44.699 --> 01:10:46.918
Oh. Lovely.

01:10:48.327 --> 01:10:50.500
<i>Landram 1
to Skywatch 0-3-8.</i>

01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:52.582
<i>Can you assist in
locating tylium mine?</i>

01:10:52.832 --> 01:10:54.175
<i>You got it, Captain.</i>

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:59.472
<i>My scanner indicates that you are vectored to
intersect the mine area in 24 millicentons.</i>

01:10:59.547 --> 01:11:01.174
<i>Affirmative, 0-3-8.
We have it.</i>

01:11:01.257 --> 01:11:03.259
<i>Everyone sync chronometers.</i>

01:11:03.342 --> 01:11:07.017
Captain would like a check-in every four
millicentons on the emergency frequency.

01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:09.269
Understood?
Affirmative, Jolly.

01:11:09.348 --> 01:11:11.851
<i>You are in time sync now.</i>

01:11:12.935 --> 01:11:14.937
<i>0-3-8 returning to base.</i>

01:11:15.021 --> 01:11:16.864
<i>See you guys in a while.
Good luck.</i>

01:11:29.202 --> 01:11:32.877
Boomer.
Yeah, yeah, what is it now?

01:11:32.955 --> 01:11:34.582
You're not gonna
believe this.

01:11:46.511 --> 01:11:48.229
I don't believe it.

01:12:00.858 --> 01:12:03.737
What is it?
I don't know.

01:12:06.781 --> 01:12:07.782
Okay.

01:12:10.827 --> 01:12:12.420
Okay, come on.

01:12:13.579 --> 01:12:16.048
Boy, sure is pretty.
Yeah.

01:12:16.123 --> 01:12:18.251
Sounds friendly.
Yeah.

01:12:24.966 --> 01:12:26.684
Don't shoot me!

01:12:26.759 --> 01:12:28.181
What do you want?
Wait. Wait.

01:12:28.261 --> 01:12:29.808
Wait. Don't be afraid.

01:12:29.887 --> 01:12:32.310
Listen, uh...
Hey, you're from Taura.

01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:34.893
I'm a Taurus.
How do you know that?

01:12:34.976 --> 01:12:39.777
The, uh, dialect. Listen, uh, what is this place?
What are you doing here?

01:12:39.856 --> 01:12:42.484
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?

01:12:42.567 --> 01:12:46.617
Colonial Warriors sneaking around a
resort like this with your weapons drawn!

01:12:46.696 --> 01:12:49.620
Oh, uh, sorry. This is legal!
Isn't it?

01:12:50.283 --> 01:12:52.706
Well, uh,
how did you get here?

01:12:53.119 --> 01:12:55.292
Oh!
I came in a skybus.

01:12:55.955 --> 01:12:57.502
She must have been
smoking plant vapor.

01:12:59.375 --> 01:13:01.878
Hey, hey, wait, wait, listen.
Could you, uh...

01:13:01.961 --> 01:13:04.464
Could you, uh, tell us
something about this bus?

01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:08.760
Oh, my travelator, he took care of all of it.
Isn't it fabulous here?

01:13:08.843 --> 01:13:10.720
All this
for so little money.

01:13:10.803 --> 01:13:15.650
Oh, and I just won 1,000... Over 1,000 cubits.
Isn't that amazing?

01:13:15.725 --> 01:13:17.568
You won those cubits here?

01:13:17.643 --> 01:13:20.817
Oh, in here. Everybody's doing it.
It's incredible.

01:13:21.147 --> 01:13:23.445
Oh, you know,
if it's illegal,

01:13:23.524 --> 01:13:26.152
you're gonna have to fight
the whole star system.

01:13:26.777 --> 01:13:28.074
I have to go!

01:13:28.154 --> 01:13:32.375
I have a moonlight cruise. Two moons.
Oh, how can you go wrong?

01:13:35.453 --> 01:13:38.252
I don't get it. How
cut off can these people be?

01:13:38.331 --> 01:13:41.084
She didn't act like she'd even heard
about the destruction of the Colonies.

01:13:41.167 --> 01:13:42.794
Yeah, there's something
even more peculiar.

01:13:42.877 --> 01:13:44.675
Why haven't we heard
about this place?

01:13:44.754 --> 01:13:49.601
Look, I suppose you know every gambling
chancery in this star system, huh?

01:13:49.675 --> 01:13:51.268
Oh, that's right.
That's right.

01:13:51.344 --> 01:13:54.473
If there's a game going on,
you'd know about it.

01:14:03.022 --> 01:14:04.649
Yeah! Whoo!

01:14:12.657 --> 01:14:16.378
The odds must be incredible here, Boomer.
People are winning a fortune.

01:14:16.452 --> 01:14:18.375
Yes, and they're
obviously well-fed.

01:14:18.454 --> 01:14:21.458
Look, why don't we find out about
who's in charge of this place

01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:23.713
and see about getting some
food back up to the fleet?

01:14:23.793 --> 01:14:26.467
Now, hold it, Boomer. The last
thing these people may wanna find

01:14:26.545 --> 01:14:28.547
is a battlestar sitting
on their front door.

01:14:28.631 --> 01:14:30.599
I haven't found
a gambling den yet

01:14:30.675 --> 01:14:34.600
that didn't depend on military pay
vouchers to keep its doors open.

01:14:34.679 --> 01:14:38.900
Now, Boomer, until we find
out who these people are,

01:14:38.975 --> 01:14:40.648
just remember,
it'll only take one informer,

01:14:40.726 --> 01:14:43.479
and we'll have the whole Cylon
war machine on its way.

01:14:44.021 --> 01:14:46.774
I wanna look around, sit in
on a game or two, see if I can

01:14:46.857 --> 01:14:49.701
find out what's behind
this place.

01:15:03.124 --> 01:15:06.674
Your mission, Boxey, is to
keep your eye on that readout.

01:15:06.794 --> 01:15:08.011
When the counter
gets up to 10,

01:15:08.087 --> 01:15:10.215
it means we're right on top
of a rich tylium deposit.

01:15:10.297 --> 01:15:11.674
Yes, sir.

01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:21.188
We'd better talk.
Right.

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:36.954
They can't try to read
our lips in here. Who?

01:15:37.033 --> 01:15:40.128
Whoever might be up
to something in this place.

01:15:40.202 --> 01:15:43.672
Well, Boomer, one thing this
place isn't is crooked.

01:15:45.458 --> 01:15:47.631
Where'd you get all those cubits?
Gambling.

01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:49.633
I'm telling you, Boomer,
you can't lose.

01:15:49.712 --> 01:15:51.214
That's what
I'm talkin' about.

01:15:51.297 --> 01:15:54.301
You ever been in a gambling chancery
where you couldn't lose your money?

01:15:54.383 --> 01:15:56.806
No, but then I've never
been here before either.

01:16:12.109 --> 01:16:13.235
Boomer, I got an idea.

01:16:13.319 --> 01:16:15.913
We could make a fortune if we put
those girls on the star circuit.

01:16:15.988 --> 01:16:18.082
You know, I mean, big money, Boomer.
Big money.

01:16:18.157 --> 01:16:19.909
Big money, huh?
Hmm!

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:24.130
Every creature in the universe
is out to exterminate us,

01:16:24.205 --> 01:16:26.082
and you wanna hire
a vocal group.

01:16:26.165 --> 01:16:27.382
Mmm-hmm.

01:16:27.458 --> 01:16:30.257
Starbuck, I'm telling you, there's
something just not right about this place.

01:16:30.336 --> 01:16:31.337
Yeah.

01:16:46.018 --> 01:16:47.861
Yeah, I gotta talk
to those girls.

01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:05.209
Quiet, Muff it.
I see it. Tylium.

01:17:06.163 --> 01:17:07.631
Nice going, Boxey.

01:17:07.706 --> 01:17:09.049
That's a pretty hot
reading, skipper.

01:17:09.125 --> 01:17:11.002
We may be right on top
of that old mine.

01:17:11.085 --> 01:17:13.053
I'd better check it out.

01:17:14.421 --> 01:17:16.423
Okay, Jolly,
keep your eyes open.

01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:20.637
I'll bring him back.

01:17:20.719 --> 01:17:21.971
Hey, Boxey!

01:17:22.054 --> 01:17:25.103
Boxey, wait right here.
I'm gonna get him back.

01:17:26.225 --> 01:17:28.523
Muffy? Muffy?

01:17:29.145 --> 01:17:30.488
Thank you.

01:17:31.230 --> 01:17:32.527
For what?

01:17:33.941 --> 01:17:35.534
For saving my son's life.

01:17:35.776 --> 01:17:38.871
You're getting things
a little out of proportion.

01:17:38.946 --> 01:17:41.244
Anyway, maybe I should
be thanking you.

01:17:42.783 --> 01:17:45.753
You don't know anything about me or
what happened to Boxey's father or...

01:17:45.828 --> 01:17:47.751
When you're ready,
you'll tell me.

01:17:49.290 --> 01:17:53.545
In the meantime, nothing that's gone
on before really counts for much.

01:17:54.128 --> 01:17:56.756
As far as the human race
is concerned,

01:17:57.506 --> 01:17:59.474
we're all starting over.

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:03.228
Muffy?

01:18:03.846 --> 01:18:05.098
Muffy?

01:18:06.682 --> 01:18:07.934
Muffy?

01:18:10.978 --> 01:18:13.026
Muffy? Muffy?

01:18:13.105 --> 01:18:16.951
Darn you, daggit,
where are you? Muffy?

01:18:17.818 --> 01:18:18.990
Muffy?

01:18:20.613 --> 01:18:21.785
Muffy?

01:18:23.073 --> 01:18:24.245
Muffy?

01:18:47.056 --> 01:18:49.479
Any sign of Boxey?
I'm afraid not.

01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:51.226
What is it?

01:18:52.353 --> 01:18:53.775
What's happening
on this planet?

01:18:54.772 --> 01:18:56.240
I don't know.

01:19:10.454 --> 01:19:12.832
This may be the largest
tylium mine in the star system.

01:19:12.915 --> 01:19:15.668
I don't care about that. I just
want to know what's happened to Boxey.

01:19:28.973 --> 01:19:32.853
<i>Welcome to Carillon.
You are impressed?</i>

01:19:32.935 --> 01:19:34.357
Confused would be
more like it.

01:19:34.687 --> 01:19:36.530
Listen, we've lost
a little boy.

01:19:39.984 --> 01:19:43.204
<i>He is safe. We
found him and brought him here.</i>

01:19:44.613 --> 01:19:46.456
<i>Would you care to join him?</i>

01:19:46.532 --> 01:19:47.784
Yes, we would.

01:19:52.788 --> 01:19:53.960
Mommy!

01:19:55.291 --> 01:19:58.545
Captain, good fortune
smiles on us.

01:19:58.627 --> 01:20:01.471
Yeah, it's like nothing we
ever dreamed of, Captain.

01:20:01.547 --> 01:20:04.972
They've got everything we need here,
plenty of it, and they're happy to share.

01:20:05.050 --> 01:20:06.848
Sounds like paradise.

01:20:08.053 --> 01:20:09.100
Yeah, it does.

01:20:09.179 --> 01:20:12.809
Colonel, a message
from Sire Uri.

01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:31.202
Well, Colonel,

01:20:32.619 --> 01:20:34.292
a most optimistic note.

01:20:34.371 --> 01:20:36.123
Too optimistic.

01:20:36.206 --> 01:20:37.549
Uri has everyone
in the fleet

01:20:37.624 --> 01:20:39.968
breaking in the bulkheads
to get down to the surface.

01:20:40.044 --> 01:20:42.718
Well, perhaps in small
numbers, in orderly rotation.

01:20:42.796 --> 01:20:44.093
It isn't going
to be that way.

01:20:44.715 --> 01:20:48.345
Already he's authorized visitor's
permits to half our population.

01:20:49.094 --> 01:20:50.892
Half the population?

01:20:55.768 --> 01:20:58.271
<i>We've come
so far, so quickly.</i>

01:20:58.979 --> 01:21:01.482
<i>There's been
little time for reason.</i>

01:21:02.191 --> 01:21:06.162
<i>What is the curious secret behind
the existence of this outpost</i>

01:21:06.236 --> 01:21:08.409
<i>on the outer rim
of our star system?</i>

01:21:08.489 --> 01:21:12.039
<i>There are many such oases
for intergalactic travelers,</i>

01:21:12.117 --> 01:21:15.166
<i>but none so far off
the known arteries of trade,</i>

01:21:15.829 --> 01:21:19.459
<i>and none so curiously
close to a tylium mine.</i>

01:21:20.751 --> 01:21:23.675
Fuel has begun to arrive
from the Ovion mines,

01:21:23.754 --> 01:21:26.052
but in curiously
small quantities.

01:21:26.131 --> 01:21:28.259
And now I feel
the growing need

01:21:28.342 --> 01:21:30.811
for extraordinary
measures of precaution.

01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:34.223
<i>The ships continue
to hover over the planet,</i>

01:21:34.306 --> 01:21:36.479
<i>supported by small
maintenance crews</i>

01:21:36.558 --> 01:21:39.812
<i>whose spirits are as depleted
as their numbers.</i>

01:21:44.983 --> 01:21:48.704
Everyone seems to have forgotten
our flight from the Cylons.

01:21:50.072 --> 01:21:55.920
The beauty and wiles of Carillon
hold our people spellbound.

01:22:05.087 --> 01:22:06.680
Let 'em ride.

01:22:06.755 --> 01:22:08.348
Hello, Starbuck.

01:22:09.591 --> 01:22:11.764
This is my lucky night.

01:22:11.844 --> 01:22:13.141
Just might be.

01:22:13.220 --> 01:22:15.814
Yeah. Well, money
isn't everything.

01:22:16.348 --> 01:22:17.520
No?
Mmm-mmm.

01:22:19.393 --> 01:22:22.693
Um, listen, have you checked
out the accommodations yet?

01:22:22.771 --> 01:22:26.025
Most of my unit is staying
down on Carillon tonight.

01:22:26.733 --> 01:22:27.985
I'll see
what I can arrange.

01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:29.362
Okay.

01:22:33.157 --> 01:22:34.875
Are you going to play, sir?

01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:36.452
Oh, I hope so.

01:22:37.369 --> 01:22:40.168
Hmm? Oh!
Uh, yeah, sure.

01:22:40.247 --> 01:22:42.966
Let 'em ride again.
It's my lucky night.

01:22:53.385 --> 01:22:54.477
Can't lose.

01:22:59.391 --> 01:23:01.143
Is this seat taken?

01:23:01.768 --> 01:23:04.146
Oh, uh...
Well, it's, uh...

01:23:04.229 --> 01:23:06.152
Starbuck...
Yeah?

01:23:06.231 --> 01:23:09.701
I became because
I think I owe you an apology.

01:23:09.776 --> 01:23:10.777
You do?

01:23:10.861 --> 01:23:11.987
Come on.
This paradise?

01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:14.038
It's the perfect
opportunity for us

01:23:14.114 --> 01:23:18.119
to be open and honest
with one another.

01:23:18.202 --> 01:23:19.169
Yeah.

01:23:19.244 --> 01:23:20.621
I hurt you. Admit it.

01:23:21.497 --> 01:23:22.874
Well, it...

01:23:23.874 --> 01:23:25.842
Didn't you once tell me
that I was the only woman

01:23:25.918 --> 01:23:28.421
you'd ever had any real
and deep feelings toward?

01:23:28.504 --> 01:23:30.552
Yeah, I may have said that.

01:23:31.256 --> 01:23:32.678
You may have said that?

01:23:32.758 --> 01:23:35.477
No, uh...
No, Athena, wait.

01:23:35.552 --> 01:23:38.055
What I meant to say is

01:23:39.473 --> 01:23:41.851
I've had to shut all those
feelings out of my mind

01:23:41.934 --> 01:23:45.108
to avoid any more pain
than I've already suffered.

01:23:50.275 --> 01:23:51.572
Starbuck.

01:23:51.693 --> 01:23:52.945
Oh, no.

01:23:57.157 --> 01:23:59.000
Hello.

01:23:59.076 --> 01:24:01.795
Excuse me. I believe
you're occupying my space.

01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:03.247
Your space?

01:24:03.664 --> 01:24:05.462
Yes. I have good news.
Huh?

01:24:05.541 --> 01:24:08.294
I got us the key
to the royal suite.

01:24:09.628 --> 01:24:12.507
Why, thank you.
We do appreciate it.

01:24:12.589 --> 01:24:15.684
Uh, say, listen, girls. I've got
this hot streak going here.

01:24:15.884 --> 01:24:18.012
Oh!
I see.

01:24:18.262 --> 01:24:19.479
Yes, I do, too.

01:24:19.555 --> 01:24:21.603
Well, have a good time,
you two.

01:24:21.682 --> 01:24:24.856
And next time, it's at
office rates, Lieutenant.

01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:33.785
Never eaten so much
in my entire life.

01:24:34.069 --> 01:24:37.164
I'm gonna
be as fat as a pig.

01:24:38.657 --> 01:24:41.251
Push level three
for us, please.

01:24:41.326 --> 01:24:45.047
I feel like a total glutton, Answaw.
Nothing fits me anymore.

01:24:45.122 --> 01:24:48.092
And we've only been down
on the surface for three...

01:24:49.001 --> 01:24:52.756
Um, I asked you
to push the third level.

01:24:53.171 --> 01:24:55.173
There.
You've missed our lodging.

01:24:55.257 --> 01:24:58.056
I did press it.
Something seems to be wrong.

01:24:58.135 --> 01:25:00.934
Well, there are
no lodgings this far down.

01:25:02.514 --> 01:25:04.107
Look there!

01:25:04.182 --> 01:25:07.482
It seems to be taking us
all the way to the bottom.

01:25:09.187 --> 01:25:10.689
Something seems
to be happening.

01:25:10.772 --> 01:25:12.615
Let me at that control.

01:25:14.776 --> 01:25:17.575
There. We've stopped.
Thank goodness.

01:25:19.698 --> 01:25:21.826
I wonder what's down here.

01:25:47.976 --> 01:25:49.819
What is the purpose
of this special council?

01:25:49.895 --> 01:25:52.364
Adama, I'm afraid
I must ask you

01:25:52.439 --> 01:25:54.032
to respect
the order of business

01:25:54.107 --> 01:25:56.576
until called upon
by this chair.

01:25:57.235 --> 01:26:01.160
I think Councilor Uri has a
measure to propose. Thank you.

01:26:01.531 --> 01:26:02.908
My brothers,

01:26:03.867 --> 01:26:06.370
a hasty attempt
to outrun the Cylons

01:26:06.453 --> 01:26:09.002
spawned in
the midnight of desperation

01:26:09.081 --> 01:26:11.630
seems foolhardy
in the light of day.

01:26:12.125 --> 01:26:15.629
I propose, instead,
we now attempt

01:26:15.712 --> 01:26:17.589
to appeal for
justice and mercy.

01:26:17.964 --> 01:26:21.639
Justice?
Justice from the Cylons?

01:26:22.594 --> 01:26:24.267
Is that what
you actually said?

01:26:25.389 --> 01:26:27.812
Gentlemen, they've told us

01:26:29.476 --> 01:26:33.447
that they would not stop until
every human had been exterminated.

01:26:34.147 --> 01:26:37.993
Now, why should they believe
we are now willing to accept

01:26:38.068 --> 01:26:40.287
that which we have always
found to be unacceptable?

01:26:40.570 --> 01:26:42.789
To live under Cylon rule?

01:26:43.323 --> 01:26:46.076
Because we would
destroy our arms

01:26:46.159 --> 01:26:48.912
to prove we're willing
to live in peace.

01:26:49.246 --> 01:26:51.795
Destroy our only
means of defense?

01:26:51.873 --> 01:26:53.125
Or attack.

01:26:53.625 --> 01:26:55.923
May I remind my brothers

01:26:56.002 --> 01:26:58.676
that we did not have
conflict with the Cylons

01:26:58.755 --> 01:27:01.929
until we intervened in their
relations with other nations?

01:27:02.509 --> 01:27:04.807
Yes. Yes, you are right.

01:27:06.471 --> 01:27:09.065
We did not come into
conflict with the Cylons

01:27:09.141 --> 01:27:14.238
until we helped our neighbors whom
the Cylons wished to enslave.

01:27:14.312 --> 01:27:17.782
And until we helped the Hasaris
get back their nation,

01:27:17.858 --> 01:27:20.236
taken by force
by the Cylons.

01:27:20.318 --> 01:27:23.413
Correct. But if we
mind our own business,

01:27:24.114 --> 01:27:26.037
there's every reason
to believe

01:27:26.116 --> 01:27:27.993
that the Cylons
will leave us alone.

01:27:37.836 --> 01:27:40.259
If you've all come
to this council

01:27:40.714 --> 01:27:42.432
to turn your backs
on the principles

01:27:42.507 --> 01:27:44.225
of our fathers
and the Lords of Kobol

01:27:44.301 --> 01:27:46.520
from whom
all Colonies evolved,

01:27:47.888 --> 01:27:51.017
you do so
with my utter contempt.

01:27:55.729 --> 01:27:56.946
Well...

01:28:02.527 --> 01:28:06.907
Warriors are always the last to
recognize the inevitability of change.

01:28:08.241 --> 01:28:12.371
We have a choice.
Life or death.

01:28:13.121 --> 01:28:15.123
I submit that an issue
this grave

01:28:15.207 --> 01:28:17.130
should be decided
by our people.

01:28:17.417 --> 01:28:19.340
Maybe you're right.
But I'll tell you something.

01:28:19.419 --> 01:28:22.218
The military
won't be easy to convince.

01:28:22.714 --> 01:28:27.811
How, may I ask, do you propose to
present such a delicate matter, eh?

01:28:27.969 --> 01:28:32.315
At a celebration to decorate
those three brave young men

01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:36.611
who led us to safety through the
perilous straits of Madagon.

01:28:36.686 --> 01:28:39.439
One of them Adama's son,
I do believe.

01:28:39.731 --> 01:28:42.530
Just the tonic our people
need at this moment.

01:28:42.609 --> 01:28:46.739
Some old-fashioned,
down-to-goodness heroes.

01:28:59.793 --> 01:29:01.591
After you.
Thank you.

01:29:09.261 --> 01:29:11.480
Party's just
gettin' started.

01:29:14.099 --> 01:29:16.352
Do you want a little,
uh, company?

01:29:17.060 --> 01:29:19.563
I'm kind of
companied out. Thank you.

01:29:19.646 --> 01:29:22.240
You're gonna miss the tribute
for the three Warriors.

01:29:22.315 --> 01:29:25.444
I've given 'em all the
tribute they're gonna get.

01:29:26.903 --> 01:29:28.280
We missed my level.

01:29:28.363 --> 01:29:29.706
Mine, too.

01:29:30.615 --> 01:29:32.709
Something seems
to be wrong.

01:29:32.784 --> 01:29:34.661
We're going
all the way down.

01:29:34.744 --> 01:29:37.839
I didn't think that was allowed.
I wonder what's down there.

01:29:45.630 --> 01:29:48.224
Help me!
What are they doing with us?

01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:56.316
Okay, 30-70.
You guys split 70%,

01:29:56.391 --> 01:29:58.689
and I'll even pick up
the transportation.

01:29:58.768 --> 01:30:01.112
I just
don't think it'll work out.

01:30:01.187 --> 01:30:02.439
Well, why not?

01:30:10.363 --> 01:30:12.081
Look, I can't talk now.

01:30:12.157 --> 01:30:13.374
What do you mean?

01:30:13.450 --> 01:30:15.748
We'll just have to
talk about it later

01:30:15.827 --> 01:30:17.500
if you're still around.

01:30:18.872 --> 01:30:20.545
Hey, hey, wait!
Where you goin'?

01:30:20.624 --> 01:30:22.547
You're my meal ticket
out of the military.

01:30:22.626 --> 01:30:23.878
Starbuck!

01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:27.924
What are you doing? The captain's
been looking all over for you.

01:30:28.006 --> 01:30:29.633
You know, Boomer, I'm
beginning to agree with you.

01:30:29.716 --> 01:30:31.684
Something's going on
around here.

01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:33.558
Well, whatever it is,
it's gonna have to wait.

01:30:33.637 --> 01:30:35.355
We've gotta get back
to the Galactica.

01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:36.477
Uh, what for?

01:30:36.556 --> 01:30:37.603
Dress uniform.

01:30:37.682 --> 01:30:39.935
Dress uniforms. Wait. I'm not
getting into any fancy...

01:30:40.018 --> 01:30:41.110
Uh-uh, uh-uh.

01:30:41.186 --> 01:30:44.565
One does not accept our people's
highest military honor,

01:30:44.648 --> 01:30:47.322
the Gold Cluster,
in a battle suit.

01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:50.028
The Gold Cluster?
Ah, you're kidding.

01:30:50.111 --> 01:30:51.363
We got it.

01:31:19.391 --> 01:31:20.563
Commander?

01:31:26.439 --> 01:31:27.565
Commander.

01:31:28.358 --> 01:31:31.032
Just like old times,
isn't it, Tigh?

01:31:32.696 --> 01:31:35.620
Well, our ships weren't quite so
fancy, but we gave them a good run.

01:31:35.699 --> 01:31:36.700
Yes.

01:31:38.243 --> 01:31:40.211
You didn't tell anyone
we were meeting?

01:31:40.286 --> 01:31:41.538
No.
Good.

01:31:42.914 --> 01:31:45.463
Is there some reason why you and
I aren't supposed to be talking?

01:31:46.001 --> 01:31:49.096
Pick up that
ground crew communicator

01:31:49.170 --> 01:31:51.218
and climb into
the next ship, please.

01:31:51.297 --> 01:31:52.765
Climb into the next ship?

01:31:52.841 --> 01:31:54.263
Quickly.

01:32:01.891 --> 01:32:04.895
<i>You're patched in
to my internal com system.</i>

01:32:05.687 --> 01:32:08.691
<i>We are completely isolated.
No one can hear us.</i>

01:32:08.773 --> 01:32:11.196
Yes, I understand, but why
would anyone want to?

01:32:11.276 --> 01:32:14.405
<i>It grieves me to think that we
have to take such precautions</i>

01:32:14.487 --> 01:32:16.364
<i>on our own battlestar.</i>

01:32:16.698 --> 01:32:19.247
<i>Sire Uri's men
are expecting me</i>

01:32:19.325 --> 01:32:23.125
<i>to make some kind of move
over his disarmament plan.</i>

01:32:23.204 --> 01:32:26.378
<i>I find that even my private
quarters are being monitored.</i>

01:32:26.458 --> 01:32:29.883
<i>Now, what I'm about to
propose is somewhat risky.</i>

01:32:30.962 --> 01:32:34.307
<i>You don't have to go along
if you don't want to.</i>

01:32:34.382 --> 01:32:36.760
<i>Commander,
if you say we should do it,</i>

01:32:36.843 --> 01:32:39.187
<i>naturally, I say</i>
<i>we should do it.</i>

01:32:40.096 --> 01:32:41.814
<i>What is it we're about to do?</i>

01:32:43.933 --> 01:32:49.940
<i>Tigh, when would be the most
devastating time for a Cylon strike?</i>

01:32:51.941 --> 01:32:55.241
<i>Almost anytime. With half
of our Warriors down on...</i>

01:32:57.822 --> 01:33:02.498
<i>During the celebration when all of
our Warriors are down on Carillon.</i>

01:33:02.911 --> 01:33:08.463
<i>If we were attacked without being
able to recall our Warriors,</i>

01:33:09.417 --> 01:33:11.340
<i>we wouldn't have a chance.</i>

01:33:11.419 --> 01:33:15.390
<i>A few well-placed Cylon bombs in
the heart of this launching bay,</i>

01:33:16.633 --> 01:33:19.136
<i>and we wouldn't be able to get
a single fighter into the air.</i>

01:33:19.552 --> 01:33:23.557
<i>Then, you do think there's more
to Carillon than generosity?</i>

01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:25.517
<i>It smells like a trap.</i>

01:33:26.684 --> 01:33:28.482
<i>It feels like a trap.</i>

01:33:29.521 --> 01:33:31.148
<i>I believe it is a trap.</i>

01:33:32.315 --> 01:33:37.321
<i>It is imperative that we get our
pilots closer to our ships.</i>

01:33:38.696 --> 01:33:40.039
<i>Or perhaps
the other way around.</i>

01:33:40.115 --> 01:33:43.119
<i>Get our ships
closer to our pilots.</i>

01:33:43.993 --> 01:33:46.246
<i>How do we get our
fighter ships down to Carillon</i>

01:33:46.329 --> 01:33:47.706
<i>without getting
Council clearance ?</i>

01:33:48.123 --> 01:33:49.750
<i>Well, we'll launch
a couple at a time</i>

01:33:49.833 --> 01:33:52.586
<i>as if they were
part of a regular patrol.</i>

01:33:53.586 --> 01:33:57.386
<i>The Council has ordered all of
our Warriors to be at the party.</i>

01:33:57.590 --> 01:34:01.140
<i>They will be there,
in a manner of speaking.</i>

01:34:02.387 --> 01:34:05.732
<i>Now, Uri doesn't know all
of our Warriors on sight.</i>

01:34:06.432 --> 01:34:09.527
<i>He'll be counting uniforms,
not men.</i>

01:34:10.270 --> 01:34:11.613
<i>He'll be counting uniforms?</i>

01:34:11.688 --> 01:34:12.860
<i>Yes.</i>

01:34:13.189 --> 01:34:17.194
<i>And I want you to collect
all the Warrior uniforms</i>

01:34:17.277 --> 01:34:19.325
<i>you can possibly
lay your hands on</i>

01:34:19.404 --> 01:34:21.657
<i>and fill them with whomever
you can find.</i>

01:34:21.739 --> 01:34:24.913
<i>Mechanics,
kitchen personnel, anyone.</i>

01:34:26.452 --> 01:34:28.580
<i>And get them down
to that party.</i>

01:34:29.205 --> 01:34:30.627
<i>What do I tell them?</i>

01:34:30.707 --> 01:34:32.254
<i>Tell them anything.</i>

01:34:33.042 --> 01:34:37.593
<i>Tell them they're on a secret
mission, which is the truth.</i>

01:34:39.507 --> 01:34:40.724
<i>I'll do my best.</i>

01:34:41.176 --> 01:34:43.053
<i>I'm depending
upon you, Tigh.</i>

01:34:45.722 --> 01:34:47.190
<i>If I'm right,</i>

01:34:48.766 --> 01:34:53.317
<i>Uri won't be the only one who'll be
counting uniforms at that party tonight.</i>

01:34:56.107 --> 01:35:00.203
<i>I understand,
and I hope you are wrong.</i>

01:35:03.656 --> 01:35:05.829
<i>Well, we'll see.</i>

01:36:11.474 --> 01:36:12.771
What are
you doing, Colonel?

01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:15.277
Felger.

01:36:15.353 --> 01:36:17.401
I, uh, didn't mean
to startle you.

01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:19.983
Can we, uh,
give you a hand with...

01:36:20.191 --> 01:36:24.037
If you ever do that again,
you're on report, Starbuck!

01:36:28.324 --> 01:36:30.076
You can tell the rest
of your playboy pilots

01:36:30.159 --> 01:36:33.459
this is not the last flash
inspection that I'm gonna make.

01:36:34.205 --> 01:36:38.335
If I ever find uniforms in this
condition, you're in trouble.

01:36:44.382 --> 01:36:49.138
When Commander Adama sees these,
he's gonna go crazy.

01:36:56.769 --> 01:36:59.147
It's gotta be the pressure.
You know, it's unfair.

01:36:59.230 --> 01:37:00.277
A lot of those
bridge officers

01:37:00.356 --> 01:37:02.825
never get a chance
to go down to the surface

01:37:02.900 --> 01:37:05.073
while everybody else gets
to go and have a good time.

01:37:05.153 --> 01:37:06.871
Bridge officers don't
get their tails shot off

01:37:06.946 --> 01:37:08.664
flying around in
skinny little fighters.

01:37:08.990 --> 01:37:10.708
Still, I wouldn't mind
trading with them.

01:37:10.783 --> 01:37:14.253
I believe you, Boomer. I'll
mention it to the colonel.

01:37:15.496 --> 01:37:17.999
Wait a minute. I can't take over for him.
I'm not a colonel.

01:37:18.082 --> 01:37:19.584
Neither am I.

01:37:21.753 --> 01:37:23.972
So much for guilt.
Let's go to the party.

01:37:24.047 --> 01:37:25.173
Right.

01:37:36.434 --> 01:37:37.936
Hello, Father.

01:37:39.437 --> 01:37:40.609
Apollo.

01:37:41.939 --> 01:37:43.156
Well, uh...

01:37:46.778 --> 01:37:49.577
Colonel Tigh wants to be
at the celebration,

01:37:49.655 --> 01:37:52.534
so I offered to relieve him
for the night.

01:37:53.576 --> 01:37:55.249
Simply as a favor.

01:37:56.412 --> 01:37:59.882
I might have thought you'd like to see
your son getting his Star Cluster.

01:37:59.957 --> 01:38:02.460
It's well-deserved, Apollo.
Well-deserved.

01:38:03.044 --> 01:38:05.513
Precisely why I cannot
accept it as anything

01:38:05.588 --> 01:38:08.011
but another one of
Councilor Uri's ploys.

01:38:08.132 --> 01:38:10.760
How can saluting his greatest
rival's son be a ploy?

01:38:13.388 --> 01:38:15.436
I just have the feeling
that he'll propose

01:38:15.515 --> 01:38:18.485
destroying our arms
at the celebration,

01:38:18.559 --> 01:38:23.030
hoping that the cascade of
emotion will do all the damage

01:38:23.106 --> 01:38:24.904
before anyone realizes
what they've done.

01:38:24.982 --> 01:38:26.575
But you can stop it.

01:38:26.651 --> 01:38:28.153
I...

01:38:28.986 --> 01:38:32.616
Not anymore.
Haven't you heard the talk?

01:38:32.698 --> 01:38:33.870
I got us
into this predicament...

01:38:33.950 --> 01:38:38.330
No one believes that. And even if
some do, you have to speak out.

01:38:38.413 --> 01:38:42.008
How can I say to you that you've
been more than a father to me?

01:38:42.083 --> 01:38:46.008
You've been someone I could look
up to with trust and respect.

01:38:46.587 --> 01:38:50.342
My ideals rise and fall on your
standards, and this isn't you.

01:38:51.592 --> 01:38:54.266
What's happening to you?
Help me to understand.

01:38:55.596 --> 01:38:57.644
You'll understand, my son.

01:38:58.516 --> 01:39:00.769
In time, you'll understand.

01:39:20.538 --> 01:39:23.633
I know that wasn't easy
for you, not telling him.

01:39:23.708 --> 01:39:24.960
Perhaps you should have.

01:39:25.042 --> 01:39:26.294
No.

01:39:27.211 --> 01:39:31.432
No. If I told him, I wouldn't have
been able to keep him from my side.

01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:36.930
This is my gamble.
If I win, we all win.

01:39:37.013 --> 01:39:40.563
But if you're wrong,
Uri will destroy you.

01:39:42.393 --> 01:39:43.895
I'm not wrong.

01:39:45.980 --> 01:39:48.984
The Cylons lured me
into their deception once.

01:39:51.194 --> 01:39:52.571
Never again.

01:40:03.581 --> 01:40:05.174
That's very strange.

01:40:05.249 --> 01:40:06.751
What is?

01:40:07.376 --> 01:40:09.925
That man's insignia
is Blue Squadron.

01:40:10.671 --> 01:40:12.014
I thought I knew
everybody in it,

01:40:12.089 --> 01:40:13.432
and look at the fit
of that uniform.

01:40:15.343 --> 01:40:19.564
Apollo, tonight is a night
of thanksgiving,

01:40:19.639 --> 01:40:23.689
and everyone's dressing up and
making do with whatever they have.

01:40:23.768 --> 01:40:26.362
He probably
hasn't worn that in years.

01:40:27.772 --> 01:40:32.403
Besides, the guest of honor
looks absolutely delicious.

01:40:46.541 --> 01:40:47.963
Hi.

01:40:48.042 --> 01:40:50.420
How lovely
you look in your uniform.

01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:52.217
Huh? Oh.

01:40:53.381 --> 01:40:55.725
Hey, isn't this
something, Boxey?

01:40:56.509 --> 01:40:58.261
Our hosts have been
very generous.

01:40:58.678 --> 01:41:00.646
I don't like them.
What?

01:41:00.721 --> 01:41:02.564
I told him the Ovions
wouldn't approve of him

01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:03.857
bringing Muff it
to the celebration.

01:41:05.142 --> 01:41:07.315
Well, we put one over
on them, didn't we?

01:41:07.395 --> 01:41:09.989
Except for your captain,
I deduce from the uniforms

01:41:10.064 --> 01:41:12.487
that most of your
Warriors are here.

01:41:12.567 --> 01:41:14.535
Yes, well, I'm always
a big draw.

01:41:25.371 --> 01:41:27.044
Muff it, Muff it,
come back here!

01:41:27.123 --> 01:41:29.171
Here, daggit!
Come back here!

01:41:33.379 --> 01:41:34.471
Starbuck.

01:41:34.547 --> 01:41:35.594
Yes? What is it?

01:41:35.673 --> 01:41:37.846
I'm talking to the great
and near great.

01:41:37.925 --> 01:41:41.179
Well, when you come down,
tell me who that is.

01:41:44.098 --> 01:41:46.192
Those three guys
right behind the dancer.

01:41:46.267 --> 01:41:48.361
Darned if I know. They
sure have lousy tailors.

01:41:48.811 --> 01:41:50.654
Starbuck,
you should know them.

01:41:50.730 --> 01:41:52.528
Yeah? Why should I know them?

01:41:52.607 --> 01:41:55.235
Because they're wearing the
insignia from our squadron.

01:41:58.487 --> 01:42:00.080
Don't start without me.

01:42:02.033 --> 01:42:04.206
Where is
the lieutenant going?

01:42:06.162 --> 01:42:07.163
Um, to find
the captain, sir.

01:42:07.246 --> 01:42:08.247
Excellent.

01:42:08.664 --> 01:42:10.382
Hey, what's going on?

01:42:10.499 --> 01:42:12.877
Stop those guys. Stop them.
What are you...

01:42:17.381 --> 01:42:19.133
What are
you doing, Starbuck?

01:42:19.216 --> 01:42:21.594
Listen, something's going on
around here.

01:42:21.677 --> 01:42:23.645
Those three impostors,
I just...

01:42:23.721 --> 01:42:25.940
Uh, listen, can we talk?

01:42:26.015 --> 01:42:27.358
Yeah.

01:42:27.433 --> 01:42:29.811
Will you excuse us? The
lieutenant needs attention.

01:42:29.894 --> 01:42:31.896
I'll take Boxey
and get something to eat.

01:42:31.979 --> 01:42:33.151
Where is Boxey?

01:42:33.230 --> 01:42:34.823
He's probably
in watching the acrobats.

01:42:34.899 --> 01:42:36.196
They're pretty good.

01:42:36.275 --> 01:42:38.949
Well, don't be long. You two don't
want to miss your own coronation.

01:42:39.028 --> 01:42:40.120
Yeah.

01:42:40.488 --> 01:42:41.489
Boxey.

01:42:41.572 --> 01:42:42.824
What's this
about impostors?

01:42:42.907 --> 01:42:44.159
I don't know.
I don't know.

01:42:44.241 --> 01:42:46.744
I've been running into guys all
night who aren't from our unit,

01:42:46.827 --> 01:42:49.751
but they're wearing
our unit's clothes.

01:42:49.830 --> 01:42:51.582
That officer
on the shuttle.

01:42:51.666 --> 01:42:52.918
What, you spotted
one of them?

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.673
Yeah, maybe.

01:42:54.752 --> 01:42:57.096
I think we better
check this out.

01:43:03.969 --> 01:43:06.097
I suggest that you find
your two friends

01:43:06.180 --> 01:43:09.980
and tell them that we're going
to begin with or without them.

01:43:10.434 --> 01:43:11.731
Yes, sir.

01:43:19.485 --> 01:43:20.532
Looks deserted.

01:43:20.611 --> 01:43:21.612
Everyone's at the party.

01:43:21.696 --> 01:43:24.950
Not everyone. There are three
impostors down here someplace.

01:43:29.787 --> 01:43:31.209
<i>How many Warriors?</i>

01:43:35.626 --> 01:43:38.049
<i>Nearly their full
complement of Warriors.</i>

01:43:38.129 --> 01:43:41.349
<i>See that the humans remain
entertained until the end,</i>

01:43:41.424 --> 01:43:45.474
<i>then they will be yours
in the lower chambers.</i>

01:43:48.681 --> 01:43:52.652
This night, we celebrate
a most special event

01:43:52.727 --> 01:43:54.821
in the annals
of human experience.

01:43:55.730 --> 01:43:57.232
Starbuck, what'd you find?

01:43:57.314 --> 01:43:59.237
They're not here. They
must be at another level.

01:43:59.316 --> 01:44:01.159
The other levels
aren't accessible to humans.

01:44:01.235 --> 01:44:02.657
Yeah, I've been
wondering about that.

01:44:02.737 --> 01:44:04.535
Yeah, so have I.

01:44:06.532 --> 01:44:09.331
I know how to fix that.
Stand back.

01:44:17.460 --> 01:44:18.882
You're the gambler.
Pick a level.

01:44:18.961 --> 01:44:23.091
Uh, what say we have a look at what's
furthest from the guest rooms?

01:44:34.351 --> 01:44:35.398
Mmm, nice.

01:44:42.109 --> 01:44:44.862
Mmm-mmm.
You're the leader.

01:44:49.408 --> 01:44:51.285
...against any
living brother,

01:44:51.368 --> 01:44:53.541
whether a former
friend or foe.

01:44:58.375 --> 01:44:59.547
Muff it!

01:45:21.065 --> 01:45:23.193
Hmm, me and my big mouth.

01:45:23.275 --> 01:45:25.027
Well, at least we know
the secret of Carillon.

01:45:25.110 --> 01:45:28.455
Do we? What's the connection
between the casino and all this?

01:45:28.531 --> 01:45:30.249
Let's get out of here,
then figure that one out.

01:45:32.409 --> 01:45:33.410
Muff it!

01:45:34.578 --> 01:45:35.704
Run, Boxey, run!

01:45:46.257 --> 01:45:47.759
Apollo, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

01:45:47.842 --> 01:45:49.185
With all this tylium,
we're setting fire

01:45:49.260 --> 01:45:50.512
to the biggest bomb
in the universe.

01:45:50.594 --> 01:45:51.641
Yeah.

01:45:54.181 --> 01:45:55.774
I guess it's a little late to
try and talk to these fellows.

01:45:55.850 --> 01:45:57.272
I think so.

01:46:06.443 --> 01:46:07.786
Oh, my God!

01:46:11.365 --> 01:46:13.333
Some of them are probably
from our ships.

01:46:13.409 --> 01:46:16.788
No wonder no one's ever
left here to tell about this resort.

01:46:16.871 --> 01:46:19.215
The Ovions
are living off of them,

01:46:19.290 --> 01:46:22.544
and probably selling the tylium
they mine to the Cylons.

01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:24.007
That's Muff it!

01:46:24.086 --> 01:46:26.009
Hey, Boxey,
come back here!

01:46:26.922 --> 01:46:28.720
No!

01:46:28.799 --> 01:46:30.176
Muff it!

01:46:30.259 --> 01:46:31.431
Muff it!

01:46:32.094 --> 01:46:33.141
Starbuck!

01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:50.078
Let's go! Follow me!

01:46:58.078 --> 01:46:59.751
Report, Centurion.

01:47:00.706 --> 01:47:03.050
<i>It is done,
imperious Leader.</i>

01:47:03.125 --> 01:47:05.298
Let the attack begin.

01:47:05.377 --> 01:47:07.550
<i>By your command,
imperious Leader.</i>

01:47:18.098 --> 01:47:19.224
We're doing fine!

01:47:19.308 --> 01:47:20.309
Whoops.

01:47:24.772 --> 01:47:25.944
There's too many of them.

01:47:26.023 --> 01:47:28.367
Go for the ceilings.
Set fire to the tylium.

01:47:29.902 --> 01:47:32.530
That must be why
you're a captain.

01:47:38.369 --> 01:47:40.667
<i>Call out the entire garrison.</i>

01:47:58.889 --> 01:48:02.063
Scanner's picking up a large
body of objects closing rapidly.

01:48:02.393 --> 01:48:03.770
Scan for alien forms.

01:48:06.855 --> 01:48:11.952
A wiping clean of the slate
of animosities and prejudice.

01:48:15.447 --> 01:48:17.165
This way! This way!

01:48:17.241 --> 01:48:18.618
Run, Boxey!

01:48:19.785 --> 01:48:21.253
Captain, where have
you guys been?

01:48:21.328 --> 01:48:23.171
We've been looking
all over for you!

01:48:23.247 --> 01:48:24.248
Come on!

01:48:44.101 --> 01:48:46.570
When these fires reach hyper-combustion,
the whole planet's gonna blow.

01:48:46.645 --> 01:48:48.522
Let's get out of here!

01:48:51.233 --> 01:48:52.234
Oh, frak!

01:49:01.618 --> 01:49:04.713
Form scan positive. Multiple
three-passenger vehicles.

01:49:04.788 --> 01:49:06.756
Cylon attack craft.

01:49:06.832 --> 01:49:08.880
So they spring their trap.

01:49:10.461 --> 01:49:13.089
Enemy approaching,
90 microns.

01:49:17.634 --> 01:49:18.635
<i>Arm weapons.</i>

01:49:19.219 --> 01:49:24.817
An opportunity to throw down our
arms and prove once and for all

01:49:26.143 --> 01:49:30.273
that peace begets peace,
and love begets love.

01:49:31.523 --> 01:49:32.820
And so, I...

01:49:33.108 --> 01:49:34.735
Everybody, listen to me!

01:49:34.818 --> 01:49:37.492
I want everybody to move quickly
and orderly towards the exits!

01:49:37.571 --> 01:49:38.618
That is an order!

01:49:38.697 --> 01:49:40.950
Stay where you are!
I'm in charge here!

01:49:42.493 --> 01:49:44.916
Do what the man says!
He's in charge...

01:49:49.500 --> 01:49:51.844
Over here, Muff it.
I'm gonna save you.

01:50:00.719 --> 01:50:03.142
Enemy closing, 70 microns.

01:50:25.744 --> 01:50:28.793
Enemy approaching,
55 microns.

01:50:38.215 --> 01:50:39.967
Serina, take Boxey!

01:50:42.177 --> 01:50:43.394
I'll be back.

01:50:43.512 --> 01:50:45.435
Let's go! Move it out!
Take it easy!

01:51:00.904 --> 01:51:03.498
Muff it! Wait! We can't
leave without Muff it!

01:51:12.916 --> 01:51:13.917
We can't leave
without Muff it.

01:51:14.585 --> 01:51:15.837
Let's go!

01:51:36.982 --> 01:51:39.781
Do you have any idea where these
Landrams are coming from?

01:51:40.944 --> 01:51:41.945
I don't know.

01:51:42.029 --> 01:51:43.281
Landrams courtesy
of Commander Adama.

01:51:54.208 --> 01:51:56.882
Thirty-five microns
and closing.

01:51:58.045 --> 01:51:59.797
Jolly, what are you doing
in combat dress?

01:51:59.880 --> 01:52:02.383
The rest of Blue Squadron didn't
get to go to the party, sir.

01:52:02.466 --> 01:52:03.513
I guess they had to
let you go, though,

01:52:03.592 --> 01:52:04.809
or they'd have been wise
they didn't have

01:52:04.885 --> 01:52:06.057
all the military
personnel there.

01:52:06.136 --> 01:52:08.389
Well, if you didn't go to the
party, who were those guys?

01:52:08.472 --> 01:52:11.100
Anybody the commander could find
in fleet to fill the uniforms.

01:52:11.183 --> 01:52:12.810
You should've seen
the one that got mine.

01:52:18.106 --> 01:52:20.359
Enemy closing, 30 microns.

01:52:20.442 --> 01:52:22.365
Recall all Warriors from surface.
Yes, sir.

01:52:32.788 --> 01:52:34.040
<i>Stand by to attack.</i>

01:52:34.122 --> 01:52:35.840
Twenty-five microns.

01:52:36.667 --> 01:52:38.089
And closing.

01:52:42.047 --> 01:52:43.549
I want you ladies
in that shuttle craft.

01:52:43.632 --> 01:52:44.599
Jolly, what's going on?

01:52:44.675 --> 01:52:46.473
The whole squadron's waiting
for orders from the <i>Galactica.</i>

01:52:46.551 --> 01:52:47.848
Yahoo!

01:52:48.178 --> 01:52:49.725
Fifteen microns.

01:52:50.222 --> 01:52:52.941
Cylon attack force
now closing to killer range.

01:52:57.938 --> 01:52:58.939
They'll take you
in the shuttle.

01:52:59.439 --> 01:53:01.191
Let's go.
Bye.

01:53:01.275 --> 01:53:03.073
Take care of your mom.

01:53:05.028 --> 01:53:07.156
I wish he could be my daddy.

01:53:11.576 --> 01:53:14.671
Enemy closing in, 10 microns.

01:53:18.625 --> 01:53:21.174
<i>They are not
sending out Interceptors.</i>

01:53:21.253 --> 01:53:23.756
<i>We have taken them
completely by surprise.</i>

01:53:24.298 --> 01:53:26.392
Closing in, five microns.

01:53:26.925 --> 01:53:30.520
Four, three, two, one.

01:53:38.729 --> 01:53:40.106
Positive shield, now!

01:53:54.494 --> 01:53:55.495
<i>Starbuck?</i>

01:53:55.579 --> 01:53:57.001
Revved and ready
for takeoff.

01:54:04.921 --> 01:54:05.968
It's coming right at us.

01:54:14.431 --> 01:54:15.683
Fire in the bay!

01:54:15.766 --> 01:54:16.983
Damage control.

01:54:19.353 --> 01:54:20.354
<i>Your wing ready, Jolly?</i>

01:54:20.437 --> 01:54:21.438
<i>Ready, sir.</i>

01:54:21.521 --> 01:54:23.523
<i>Boomer?
Ready, Captain.</i>

01:54:23.607 --> 01:54:24.779
<i>Let's go.</i>

01:54:39.956 --> 01:54:41.173
There's nothing
to stop them!

01:54:52.135 --> 01:54:53.728
Sir, incoming surface
squadron doesn't seem

01:54:53.804 --> 01:54:56.603
to match any known
Cylon war machines.

01:55:05.273 --> 01:55:06.991
<i>Are they gonna be surprised.</i>

01:55:11.780 --> 01:55:12.997
<i>If we don't stop them,
we're gonna have</i>

01:55:13.073 --> 01:55:14.290
<i>to go back and live
on that rock.</i>

01:55:21.665 --> 01:55:22.666
<i>On target.</i>

01:55:31.341 --> 01:55:33.014
<i>That one's for the Atlantia.</i>

01:55:35.095 --> 01:55:36.438
<i>Here's one for Zac.</i>

01:55:40.267 --> 01:55:43.612
Father, they're ours!
All of them! But how?

01:55:43.687 --> 01:55:45.314
Looks to me like
a lot of our boys

01:55:45.397 --> 01:55:46.990
violated orders
and skipped the party.

01:55:47.065 --> 01:55:49.443
Yes, make a note, Colonel, to
discuss discipline in the ranks.

01:55:49.526 --> 01:55:50.527
Yes, sir.

01:56:03.707 --> 01:56:05.380
<i>Starbuck?
Yo.</i>

01:56:05.459 --> 01:56:07.052
<i>On your tail.
Nothing to worry about.</i>

01:56:10.213 --> 01:56:11.430
<i>Felgercarb!</i>

01:56:19.473 --> 01:56:20.520
<i>Boomer, you give him a hand.</i>

01:56:20.599 --> 01:56:21.600
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

01:56:24.603 --> 01:56:26.571
<i>Don't take too long, Boomer.</i>

01:56:33.820 --> 01:56:35.538
<i>Thanks for the assist.</i>

01:56:42.162 --> 01:56:44.506
<i>Squadron Vector Alpha.
I'm onto three.</i>

01:56:46.500 --> 01:56:47.843
<i>Uh, make that two.</i>

01:56:59.179 --> 01:57:01.853
<i>Let's go! Press it home!
Press it home!</i>

01:57:02.224 --> 01:57:04.852
<i>I think
we got them on the run.</i>

01:57:05.185 --> 01:57:07.233
<i>Now, let's see if we can
find that Cylon base ship.</i>

01:57:07.312 --> 01:57:08.609
<i>Nothing on my scanner.</i>

01:57:09.105 --> 01:57:10.573
<i>It's hidden
someplace behind Carillon.</i>

01:57:10.649 --> 01:57:13.118
<i>That's the only way it could have
approached us without being picked up.</i>

01:57:13.193 --> 01:57:15.036
<i>We're not gonna
let that base ship go.</i>

01:57:15.529 --> 01:57:16.872
<i>It can follow us
at a safe distance</i>

01:57:16.947 --> 01:57:19.541
<i>and plot our every move until
the reinforcements arrive.</i>

01:57:19.616 --> 01:57:21.414
<i>Let's go down on the deck
beneath the scanners.</i>

01:57:24.079 --> 01:57:28.209
Warriors requesting permission to
locate and pursue Cylon base ship.

01:57:29.376 --> 01:57:32.471
No. Colonel, we must
conserve our resources

01:57:32.546 --> 01:57:34.469
if we're to find a home
for our people.

01:57:34.548 --> 01:57:36.346
Bring the fleet home.

01:57:37.551 --> 01:57:38.894
<i>Get onto
Cylon frequency.</i>

01:57:38.969 --> 01:57:40.312
<i>What for?</i>

01:57:40.387 --> 01:57:42.640
<i>They can't see us, but
they'll be able to hear us.</i>

01:57:42.722 --> 01:57:44.395
<i>Doing what? Praying?</i>

01:57:44.683 --> 01:57:46.560
<i>No, you're gonna be
Red and Blue Squadrons,</i>

01:57:46.643 --> 01:57:47.940
<i>and I'm gonna be
Green and Yellow.</i>

01:57:48.019 --> 01:57:51.740
<i>I'll be Red and Blue...
Oh, I get it!</i>

01:57:51.815 --> 01:57:52.941
<i>No, I don't.</i>

01:57:53.108 --> 01:57:56.829
Sir, two of our Warriors are
overdue and unaccounted for.

01:57:56.903 --> 01:57:58.405
Who?

01:57:58.488 --> 01:58:00.490
It's Captain Apollo, sir.

01:58:02.325 --> 01:58:03.622
Who else?

01:58:03.702 --> 01:58:05.170
And Starbuck.

01:58:06.454 --> 01:58:07.580
I see.

01:58:09.457 --> 01:58:11.835
<i>Switching frequencies now.</i>

01:58:15.880 --> 01:58:17.223
<i>This is Green Leader to Red.</i>

01:58:17.299 --> 01:58:20.018
<i>All ships in formation and
ready for attack. Come in.</i>

01:58:21.344 --> 01:58:25.724
<i>Uh, yeah. Yeah, we're all ready.
Every one of us.</i>

01:58:27.642 --> 01:58:29.269
Speak, Centurion.

01:58:29.352 --> 01:58:30.774
<i>By your command.</i>

01:58:30.854 --> 01:58:34.904
<i>Colonial Viper squadrons
approaching in large numbers.</i>

01:58:34.983 --> 01:58:37.987
Surely our Raiders are
close enough to defend us.

01:58:38.445 --> 01:58:42.200
<i>All Raiders are still engaged
against the Galactica.</i>

01:58:42.282 --> 01:58:45.786
Retreat base ship behind the
protection of Carillon.

01:58:45.869 --> 01:58:48.247
Their scanners
will not be able to find us.

01:58:52.709 --> 01:58:55.258
<i>Yellow Leader, we have
your squadron in visual contact.</i>

01:58:55.337 --> 01:58:56.554
Uh, right.

01:58:56.630 --> 01:58:58.678
<i>Green Leader,
I've got two more squadrons</i>

01:58:58.757 --> 01:59:00.350
<i>requesting permission
to join us.</i>

01:59:00.425 --> 01:59:02.598
<i>Purple and Orange squadrons.</i>

01:59:02.677 --> 01:59:03.894
<i>They're just dying
for a good fight.</i>

01:59:03.970 --> 01:59:05.688
<i>Been on reconnaissance
for centons.</i>

01:59:05.764 --> 01:59:07.357
<i>Purple and Orange?</i>

01:59:08.808 --> 01:59:11.527
<i>Uh, negative, Blue Leader.
Let's not get carried away.</i>

01:59:11.603 --> 01:59:14.402
<i>We've got all the manpower we
need to knock out one base ship.</i>

01:59:14.773 --> 01:59:16.616
Commander, we're picking up
some attack signals

01:59:16.691 --> 01:59:18.614
between Purple
and Orange squadrons.

01:59:18.693 --> 01:59:21.037
We don't have Purple
and Orange squadrons.

01:59:21.112 --> 01:59:22.785
Purple and Orange?

01:59:25.325 --> 01:59:27.327
Starbuck and Apollo?

01:59:32.832 --> 01:59:34.584
Lord help them both.

01:59:41.549 --> 01:59:43.597
<i>The Warriors
continue to advance.</i>

01:59:43.677 --> 01:59:45.600
<i>At least six squadrons.</i>

01:59:45.929 --> 01:59:48.933
Recall all Raiders
to defend base ship.

01:59:49.015 --> 01:59:51.017
<i>All Raiders
are all destroyed.</i>

01:59:51.101 --> 01:59:53.650
All destroyed? How?

01:59:54.312 --> 01:59:56.030
We took them by surprise.

01:59:56.106 --> 02:00:00.486
<i>Apparently, it was not as big a
surprise as we had hoped for.</i>

02:00:04.239 --> 02:00:07.334
Retreat closer to Carillon
below their scanners.

02:00:07.409 --> 02:00:09.582
<i>There are reports of fires.</i>

02:00:09.661 --> 02:00:12.039
I said lower,
or they will destroy us.

02:00:12.122 --> 02:00:13.374
<i>By your command.</i>

02:00:14.833 --> 02:00:17.177
<i>Just ahead. There she is.</i>

02:00:17.252 --> 02:00:18.378
<i>Lovely.</i>

02:00:18.461 --> 02:00:19.713
<i>What do we do? Ram her?</i>

02:00:20.088 --> 02:00:23.342
<i>We are now picking up attacking
Warriors on the scanner.</i>

02:00:23.425 --> 02:00:25.553
<i>We are too close
to the surface.</i>

02:00:25.969 --> 02:00:29.769
Sir, telemetry reports surface of
Carillon reaching vapor point.

02:00:29.848 --> 02:00:33.273
<i>There are only two ships.
It is a deception.</i>

02:00:33.351 --> 02:00:35.979
<i>Open fire and retreat
from the planet.</i>

02:00:37.480 --> 02:00:38.732
<i>Uh, Apollo...</i>

02:00:38.815 --> 02:00:40.533
<i>Okay, Starbuck,
let's get out of here</i>

02:00:40.608 --> 02:00:44.158
<i>before that tylium we set on
fire blows the planet apart.</i>

02:00:45.363 --> 02:00:47.161
Negative field, now.

02:00:48.867 --> 02:00:50.210
She's going to explode.

02:01:22.066 --> 02:01:23.363
<i>Let's go home.</i>

02:01:31.367 --> 02:01:33.995
<i>Some home. A piece of metal
in the middle of nowhere.</i>

02:01:38.041 --> 02:01:40.214
<i>Beats just plain nowhere</i>

02:01:40.293 --> 02:01:41.670
<i>at least until
we find Earth.</i>

02:01:44.380 --> 02:01:45.848
<i>Think we'll ever
really find it?</i>

02:01:47.300 --> 02:01:49.519
<i>We'll find it someday.</i>

02:01:53.807 --> 02:01:54.899
<i>Let's go in.</i>

02:02:19.749 --> 02:02:21.843
<i>Fleeing from
the Cylon tyranny,</i>

02:02:21.918 --> 02:02:24.512
<i>the last battlestar,
Galactica,</i>

02:02:24.587 --> 02:02:28.808
<i>leads a ragtag fugitive fleet
on a lonely quest.</i>

02:02:28.883 --> 02:02:33.013
<i>A shining planet
known as Earth.</i>
