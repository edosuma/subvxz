Gil would be motivated by fear.

He would also be motivated
by the urge to mate,

the other major motivator.

for some dickhead director

'cause they're stuck
with what they got

45:39.021 --> 45:40.854
'cause they didn't have
a choice.

45:40.856 --> 45:42.689
Helen:
Well, what choice do we have?

45:42.691 --> 45:44.574
Isn't it either this
or nothing, right?

45:48.080 --> 45:51.081
Betty: Actually,
I might know someone

45:51.116 --> 45:54.034
who's a whole lot better
than nothing.

45:55.671 --> 45:58.205
Man: [ Breathing heavily,
moaning ]

45:58.257 --> 46:01.541
William: I talked with
Zookeeper Steve this morning.

46:01.543 --> 46:04.511
They were astounded
at our success with Gil.

46:04.546 --> 46:07.681
Can't imagine how we managed
to pull that off.

46:09.551 --> 46:12.986
Virginia:
Well... what happened yesterday

46:13.021 --> 46:15.589
was no solution at all.

46:15.624 --> 46:18.258
William:
I wasn't looking for a solution.

46:18.293 --> 46:21.261
- I was looking for an answer.
- Virginia: To what?

46:21.330 --> 46:23.797
William: Whether or not
it could be done...

46:23.832 --> 46:27.267
Whether I could do it--
we could do it.

46:27.302 --> 46:29.236
And we did.

46:29.271 --> 46:32.372
There's something
for <i> Newsweek</i> to chew on.

46:32.408 --> 46:35.442
Virginia: We will not tell
<i>Newsweek</i> about this.

46:36.879 --> 46:40.414
William: Gil proves that
performance-based dysfunction

46:40.499 --> 46:42.132
is so rooted in our psyche

46:42.167 --> 46:44.000
that not even
the most primitive of us,

46:44.052 --> 46:47.003
under certain stresses,
are immune to its effects,

46:47.055 --> 46:48.338
but more importantly,

46:48.390 --> 46:52.426
that these dysfunctions
can be repaired by us.

46:52.428 --> 46:54.928
Now, why not let <i> Newsweek</i>
print the story

46:54.980 --> 46:58.765
that says Masters and Johnson
can fix anyone, even an ape?

46:58.817 --> 47:00.734
Virginia:
Because it's not true.

47:00.769 --> 47:02.602
William:
We can straighten out anything

47:02.688 --> 47:04.521
that human beings
manage to screw up.

47:04.573 --> 47:07.441
Virginia: We can't... Bill.

47:07.493 --> 47:10.110
And you know it.

47:10.145 --> 47:15.182
That was a fluke, not a cure,
which is why we cannot say it.

47:19.988 --> 47:23.089
[ Man and woman moaning ]

47:27.529 --> 47:30.714
[ Mid-tempo jazz music playing ]

47:37.556 --> 47:39.306
Helen:
Some doctor's office--

47:39.308 --> 47:41.975
where you can get syphilis
from breathing the air.

47:42.010 --> 47:44.361
What kind of orthopedist
works here?

47:44.396 --> 47:47.063
Betty: These women
don't need an orthopedist?

47:47.115 --> 47:50.116
On their feet all day,
twisting themselves in knots?

47:50.152 --> 47:52.235
Can you imagine
the wear and tear?

47:52.287 --> 47:53.820
Helen:
But for us, for our baby?

47:53.872 --> 47:55.539
Betty:
Honey, honey, he's a doctor

47:55.574 --> 47:58.074
with a face like a movie star
and a body that looks like

47:58.126 --> 48:00.327
it should be throwing
thunderbolts from a cloud.

48:00.329 --> 48:02.996
If you want our baby
to have the best head start,

48:02.998 --> 48:04.197
this is how we do it.

48:04.233 --> 48:05.999
Austin:
Can I help you ladies?

48:06.001 --> 48:07.250
Betty: Oh, Austin!

48:07.302 --> 48:09.386
- So gd to see you.
- Austin: Betty. How are you?

48:09.421 --> 48:10.670
- Betty: I'm good.
- Austin: Good.

48:10.672 --> 48:12.222
Betty: Uh, this is
my girlfriend, Helen.

48:12.257 --> 48:13.473
- Austin: Hi, Helen.
- Helen: Hi.

48:13.509 --> 48:15.342
- Austin: Nice to meet you.
- Helen: [ Chuckles ]

48:15.344 --> 48:18.228
Austin: Girlfriends
as in pals from high school

48:18.263 --> 48:20.680
or girlfriends
as in the previous act?

48:20.716 --> 48:23.483
Betty:
We're lovers, Austin.

48:23.519 --> 48:26.820
Austin: Okay.
Whatever works, ladies.

48:26.855 --> 48:28.255
Betty: [ Chuckles ]

48:28.290 --> 48:31.441
Austin: So, uh, what did you
want to speak to me about?

48:35.030 --> 48:39.366
Betty:
We have a favor to ask.

48:39.418 --> 48:41.835
[ Music continues ]

48:45.040 --> 48:46.456
Man: There you go!

48:48.260 --> 48:53.046
Gordon: Mm. And your most,
uh, significant case to date?

48:53.098 --> 48:57.017
Virginia: Oh, we consider
each and every case

48:57.052 --> 48:58.802
significant in its own way.

48:58.854 --> 49:01.521
Gordon: Any chance of narrowing
that down a little?

49:01.557 --> 49:03.940
You know, maybe there's
a celebrity angle

49:03.976 --> 49:06.159
that we can share
with our readers?

49:06.194 --> 49:08.828
Virginia:
Each case, taken together,

49:08.864 --> 49:12.566
makes up the body
of our scientific study.

49:14.469 --> 49:16.536
Gordon:
How about you, Dr. Masters?

49:16.572 --> 49:18.905
You care to respond?

49:18.941 --> 49:21.825
William:
I agree with Mrs. Johnson--

49:21.877 --> 49:24.911
that each case
matters on its own merits.

49:26.331 --> 49:30.884
But if I were to choose one case

49:30.919 --> 49:34.671
that stood out
as particularly meaningful...

49:34.723 --> 49:38.008
it would have to be the one
involving an ape.

49:41.597 --> 49:44.798
Al "The Ape" Neely and his wife,
Isabella Ricci.

49:44.833 --> 49:46.683
Gordon: I'm so glad
you brought them up.

49:46.735 --> 49:48.180
William: Well, since they
themselves have been so public

49:48.268 --> 49:49.319
about their treatment with us,

49:49.397 --> 49:50.570
I feel we can say
they're patients,

49:50.664 --> 49:53.916
although I can't divulge
specifics.

49:53.951 --> 49:55.241
Gordon: All right, then.

49:55.277 --> 49:57.911
In a general way, what-- what
about their case is significant?

49:59.998 --> 50:04.834
William: Well... let's take,
as an example,

50:04.870 --> 50:09.222
a real ape taken
out of its natural habitat,

50:09.257 --> 50:11.958
as a good way of understanding
what happened with the Neelys...

50:11.960 --> 50:16.212
[Inhales sharply]
Because if you take that ape

50:16.264 --> 50:22.385
and damage it in ways that
only humans can inflict damage,

50:22.437 --> 50:27.107
watch it turn itself
into something it's not,

50:27.142 --> 50:32.812
then our job is to take
those shattered parts

50:32.848 --> 50:37.083
and, uh, bring them together,

50:37.119 --> 50:42.155
and allow, through a--
a successful coupling,

50:42.190 --> 50:48.061
those wounds to finally heal.

51:02.761 --> 51:04.411
Man:
[ Imitates gorilla grunting ]

51:05.447 --> 51:07.447
Dan: I figured now
that I know your taste in men,

51:07.482 --> 51:09.749
I'd give you another chance
and ask you out to the movies.

51:09.785 --> 51:10.884
Virginia: [ Chuckles ]

51:12.988 --> 51:15.121
Dan: [ Exhales sharply ]

51:15.157 --> 51:17.457
Virginia:
Oh, God, you're drenched.

51:17.492 --> 51:19.359
How long have you
been sitting there?

51:19.394 --> 51:21.027
Dan: Hours.

51:21.063 --> 51:22.829
And I jammed the zipper
putting it on,

51:22.864 --> 51:25.231
so I'm not sure I'm ever gonna
be able to get this thing off.

51:25.267 --> 51:26.866
[ Laughs ]

51:26.902 --> 51:29.035
Virginia: Well, now I suppose
the only difference

51:29.071 --> 51:31.071
between you and every other man

51:31.106 --> 51:33.573
is that you wear your ape
on the outside.

51:34.676 --> 51:37.477
Dan: I get the feeling
this wasn't a good idea.

51:37.512 --> 51:38.712
Virginia: [ Chuckles ]

51:38.764 --> 51:40.930
I know that you were
trying to be sweet.

51:43.719 --> 51:45.468
Dan: What happened?

51:45.520 --> 51:46.970
What went wrong?

51:48.724 --> 51:51.224
Virginia:
We were successful.

He mated.

51:53.111 --> 51:55.111
Dan: But...?

51:56.865 --> 52:03.369
Virginia: But he... needed
some encouragement...

52:03.405 --> 52:05.739
- from me.
- Dan: Mm-hmm.

52:05.774 --> 52:10.677
Virginia: And I-- I think I may
have taken it a little too far.

52:12.414 --> 52:14.514
Dan: What's too far?

52:19.721 --> 52:24.457
Virginia: I showed my...

52:24.493 --> 52:26.192
Dan: Mm.

52:26.228 --> 52:28.094
Virginia: [ Sighs ]

But did you kiss him?

52:38.907 --> 52:41.808
Virginia: No.

52:41.843 --> 52:43.576
No, I didn't.
