[Hugh] Sorry for what you
and your family have gone through.

01:36.304 --> 01:37.972
Thank God the system works.

01:38.556 --> 01:41.559
Can you please shut up?
Of course you think the system worked

01:41.643 --> 01:45.021
because it was made
to protect you and people like you.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.482
He'll have his day in court.
A jury will decide.

01:47.565 --> 01:51.945
He shouldn't even be in court!
You should, 'cause you're a murderer.

01:52.028 --> 01:54.405
You have a lot of nerve
showing up to court.

01:54.489 --> 01:56.950

I understand you're upset, okay?

01:57.033 --> 01:58.451
-Upset?
-I know he's got you fooled.

01:58.535 --> 02:01.287

You wanna get arrested?
Get out! You need to go.

-Come on. Look, it's not worth it.

02:13.550 --> 02:15.218
Sorry, you shouldn't
be going through this.

02:15.301 --> 02:16.469
-Thank you.

Routledge evaded

back on the island,

-Wheezie?
-[Sarah] I don't know what else to do.

03:41.304 --> 03:43.973
I got us into this mess.
I'm gonna do my best to get us out.

03:45.350 --> 03:47.393
[scoffs] Wheezie? Yeah, that will work.

03:47.477 --> 03:49.771
Well, she's right about one thing.
We gotta do something.

03:49.854 --> 03:52.690
Our boy is a PO-dub right now, okay?

03:53.650 --> 03:57.612
He's held captive by the enemy right now,
maybe even scheduled for execution.

03:57.695 --> 04:01.032
-Are we just gonna sit here?
-What's the plan? We kidnap Shoupe?

04:01.115 --> 04:03.243
Maybe, like,
that's not the worst idea actually.

04:03.326 --> 04:04.619
-Oh, it's not?
-No!

04:04.702 --> 04:07.163
That is actually
the worst idea I've ever heard.

04:07.247 --> 04:10.124
-It's pretty bad.
-You know? Please, just stay out of this.

04:10.208 --> 04:12.585
Okay, Pope, look,
we've been doing everything your way,

04:12.669 --> 04:14.337
and how has that been working out?

04:14.420 --> 04:16.422
Okay, okay, so what's your plan?

04:17.340 --> 04:19.133
You gonna storm a jail, guns a-blazing?

04:19.217 --> 04:22.553
Look, Pope,
all I'm trying to get you to understand

04:22.637 --> 04:24.097
is they got our boy.

04:24.681 --> 04:27.976
Are we just gonna sit here and do nothing?
No! We're gonna go get his ass.

04:28.059 --> 04:29.769
We're gonna do something about it!

04:29.852 --> 04:33.690
JJ, we're not storming a jail.
It's not happening.

04:34.440 --> 04:37.694
No, fine, man.
Sit in your comfy chair. Do nothing.

04:38.778 --> 04:40.196
I'm gonna see what I can do.

04:41.489 --> 04:44.284
Make something happen,
even if I have to do it by myself.

04:44.367 --> 04:45.285
Okay.

04:46.703 --> 04:47.787
[thunder crashes]

04:49.163 --> 04:51.374
-Should we be worried?
-Yes, for sure.

04:51.457 --> 04:55.086
Look, I'm gonna hit my parents, and I'm
gonna see if I can get money for a lawyer.

04:55.169 --> 04:57.338
John B has a public defender.
He doesn't need that now.

04:57.422 --> 04:59.549
Are you crazy? Justice costs money.

05:00.258 --> 05:01.134
You're right.

05:02.010 --> 05:04.887
So I'm gonna dig in hard into anything
I can find out about this key,

05:04.971 --> 05:08.099
because that tape Limbrey has,
that's exculpatory evidence.

05:08.891 --> 05:10.101
That can exonerate John B.

05:11.019 --> 05:12.228
Yeah, we gotta try.

05:12.812 --> 05:14.522
[soft guitar music playing]

a murderer in front of the entire island.

-[sighs] I know, Rose.

05:30.413 --> 05:31.748
It's just gonna get worse.

05:31.831 --> 05:36.336
With John B and Sarah both
testifying against us and Gavin missing…

05:36.836 --> 05:39.297
There was nothing I could do
about Gavin, all right?

05:39.380 --> 05:42.216
-I told you. He came at me.
-Hey, I know. Baby, I know.

05:42.300 --> 05:45.720
Ward, I'm… I'm talking about how it looks.

05:48.890 --> 05:50.683
It seems like there's a pattern.

05:50.767 --> 05:53.061
-Hmm.
-If Shoupe believes John B's story--

05:53.144 --> 05:54.729
-No, he won't. He won't.
-What if he does?

05:54.812 --> 05:56.606
If he does, look around.

05:57.190 --> 06:02.528
All of this, everything… goes away.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.489
-I know that, Rose.
-It's gone.

06:04.572 --> 06:07.200
-You think I don't know that?
-We have to do something!

06:07.283 --> 06:08.826
-What?
-No.

06:10.036 --> 06:11.162
No. Talk to Shoupe.

06:11.245 --> 06:12.914
-I talked to him.
-Ward, talk to him again.

06:12.997 --> 06:15.583
-He's not gonna do anything else for us.
-There has to be somebody--

06:15.666 --> 06:16.667
There's not.

06:16.751 --> 06:20.129
There has to be somebody
that can help us, Ward. Think.

06:22.090 --> 06:24.384
There might be someone,
but it's a long shot.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.970

06:45.780 --> 06:47.240
Half before. Half after.

06:50.326 --> 06:53.204
Make it look like we talked about, okay?
That… that part is important.

06:53.287 --> 06:54.622
It needs to look like…

06:56.040 --> 06:56.874
[sighs]

06:57.542 --> 06:59.460
It's gotta show that he abandoned her.

07:00.628 --> 07:01.671
Like suicide.

07:02.755 --> 07:04.924
Yeah, I understand.

07:06.217 --> 07:07.301
So, you got a guy?

07:16.477 --> 07:17.478
Okay then.

07:21.858 --> 07:22.900
Tonight.

07:31.701 --> 07:35.121
Look, Terry, I know this isn't easy.
This is hard for me too. It's…

07:36.497 --> 07:38.082
But this bastard killed Susan.

07:41.419 --> 07:42.378
I was there.

07:46.174 --> 07:47.967
I tried to save her on the tarmac.

07:48.801 --> 07:50.136
She was bleeding out.

07:53.806 --> 07:56.517
So, he's gonna get
the death penalty anyway, you know.

08:02.023 --> 08:03.858
I just feel like I need you to understand

08:03.941 --> 08:06.068
what you're doing
for me and for my family.

08:10.907 --> 08:12.867
You're helping me get my daughter back.

08:28.466 --> 08:32.637
Why do you do this shit to me, Pope?
Hmm? I mean, what did I do to you?

08:32.720 --> 08:35.348
Look, I'm just trying to do
what's right and save my friend.

08:36.140 --> 08:39.101
Unfortunately,
our relationship is collateral damage.

08:39.185 --> 08:41.521
Oh, I'm gonna collateral
your head in, hmm?

08:41.604 --> 08:44.732
-It's just a truck.
-Just a truck? Lord have mercy.

08:44.815 --> 08:47.276
You telling me you wouldn't crash
a truck for your best friend?

08:47.360 --> 08:50.196
-You wouldn't crash a truck for Donny?
-I wouldn't crash shit for Donny.

08:50.279 --> 08:51.197
[chuckles]

08:51.948 --> 08:52.949
Yes, you would.

08:57.245 --> 08:58.829
Dad, this Limbrey person is legit.

08:58.913 --> 09:01.207
I believe she has evidence
that can clear John B.

09:01.290 --> 09:04.710
I'm sure of it. I heard the tape.
She wants to trade the evidence

09:04.794 --> 09:07.505
for some key that she thinks
is in our family somewhere.

09:07.588 --> 09:10.007
Hold on.
She found a picture of it at an auction.

09:14.095 --> 09:15.096
Do you recognize this?

09:20.685 --> 09:23.604
I don't know what
you done got yourself involved with, Son,

09:23.688 --> 09:26.148
but it ain't good.

09:27.358 --> 09:31.112
So, encouraging you should be
the last thing I want to do right now.

09:33.197 --> 09:34.031
But yes,

09:35.741 --> 09:38.995
it looks like something my grandmother
used to wear around her neck.

09:40.538 --> 09:41.581
Mee-maw?

09:41.664 --> 09:43.916
I remember seeing this
when I was a little boy.

09:44.750 --> 09:50.381
-Do you know where it is?
-She… she used to wear it every day.

09:50.464 --> 09:51.716
I… I don't know, Son.

09:52.300 --> 09:55.553
This looks like the drawings she made
when she started forgetting things.

09:55.636 --> 09:58.681
You can start by checking
her old apartment above the pharmacy.

09:58.764 --> 09:59.599
[sighs]

10:00.808 --> 10:01.767
Thank you.

10:02.727 --> 10:05.104
-You be careful, okay?
-Yes, sir.

10:06.522 --> 10:08.316
-I love you.
-[Pope] Love you too, Pop!

10:14.405 --> 10:16.282
[soft guitar music playing]

10:26.083 --> 10:26.959
Mom.

10:30.296 --> 10:31.172
Dad.

10:35.843 --> 10:39.013
Oh, thank God. [sighs] Oh my God.

10:39.722 --> 10:43.100
Where have you been? We were up
all night long. I was at a hospital.

10:43.184 --> 10:46.187
Well, the truck broke down,
and then my phone died.

10:46.270 --> 10:47.980
And we didn't have a plug. I--

10:48.939 --> 10:50.941
[laughs]

10:52.193 --> 10:54.403
Well, of course.
That makes complete sense.

10:55.196 --> 10:58.658
The plug? Of course. The plug. [laughs]

10:58.741 --> 10:59.617
Yeah.

11:04.455 --> 11:05.414
John B's back.

11:09.377 --> 11:11.587
Yeah, I heard that.
I heard that on the news.

11:12.713 --> 11:14.215
I heard he's arrested for murder.

11:14.298 --> 11:18.302
Yeah, but he didn't… he didn't do it,
okay? I promise. Somebody's framing him.

11:20.971 --> 11:23.516
And he's gonna need money
for a good lawyer.

11:23.599 --> 11:24.433
[scoffs]

11:25.434 --> 11:26.727
I can't do this with you.

11:26.811 --> 11:28.729
Mom, this is really important.

11:29.772 --> 11:31.482
You didn't even call me.

11:31.565 --> 11:33.984
John B's been arrested for murder.

11:35.194 --> 11:38.155
I mean, do you understand that?
It's not all about you.

11:38.239 --> 11:39.782
Yeah. [laughs]

11:44.662 --> 11:48.165
That's exactly what I was thinking
at four in the morning

11:48.249 --> 11:50.960
when I was on the beach looking to see
if your body had washed up.

11:51.043 --> 11:53.003
I was definitely thinking,
"This is all about me."

11:53.087 --> 11:55.047
Jesus, honey, you treat me like shit.

11:55.131 --> 11:56.924
You treat me like shit.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.051
You don't even trust me.

11:59.135 --> 12:01.637
Why should I trust you?
All you do is lie to me!

12:01.721 --> 12:02.888
When have I lied to you?

12:02.972 --> 12:05.766
Kiara, stop it!
Everything you're doing is for these boys.

12:05.850 --> 12:08.018
-It's about the boys.
-[Anna] It is always about the boys.

12:08.102 --> 12:10.855
You're putting these boys
above everything else.

12:10.938 --> 12:12.398
[Kie] God, you are so worried

12:12.481 --> 12:14.817
that I'm gonna sleep
with a Pogue like you did!

12:14.900 --> 12:17.278
Well, guess what? I already did.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.384
Sorry. Uh…

27:58.551 --> 27:59.386
What happened?

27:59.469 --> 28:01.554
My mom snapped, and I got booted.

28:03.890 --> 28:06.142
-Wait, what?
-It's not a big deal.

28:06.226 --> 28:08.645
I'm gonna stay here a couple days,
hang out with my friends.

28:08.728 --> 28:10.397
-[Pope] Whoa.
-We have stuff to figure out.

28:10.480 --> 28:13.566
You know, if you need a place to stay,
you can always come stay with me.

28:15.402 --> 28:19.406
Um… [clears throat] Yeah, uh…
How did things go with you?

28:20.115 --> 28:20.990
Um…

28:23.118 --> 28:23.952
Well…

28:26.246 --> 28:28.123
-Pops was upset.
-[Kie] Upset?

28:28.206 --> 28:31.000
[sarcastically] After you left
his truck in Charleston? What for?

28:31.084 --> 28:33.712
Uh, you know, I'm actually trying
to figure that out myself.

28:33.795 --> 28:35.880
-I can't really see any reason…
-[chuckles]

28:35.964 --> 28:39.843
…that would make him upset.
But, um, I did ask him about the key,

28:39.926 --> 28:43.346
and he said that
his grandmother had something like that.

28:43.430 --> 28:45.807
So, I went over to great-grandma's place,

28:45.890 --> 28:46.808
and, uh…

28:50.395 --> 28:51.354
I found…

28:54.691 --> 28:55.567
this.

28:57.777 --> 28:59.863
-Oh my God.
-Yeah.

29:00.905 --> 29:02.782
-Holy shit, Pope!
-I know, I know, right? I know.

29:02.866 --> 29:04.701
This is what we need to get the evidence!

29:04.784 --> 29:07.746
I… I… I was right in the room,
and it… it came out the ceiling!

29:07.829 --> 29:08.872
Oh my God.

29:08.955 --> 29:09.789
Look at it.

29:11.291 --> 29:13.042
Is that writing? What is that?

29:13.543 --> 29:15.170
-Turn the lights off.
-Why?

29:15.670 --> 29:17.046
Just do it. Trust me.

29:24.137 --> 29:25.180
Here.

29:26.890 --> 29:28.600
I don't see anything.

29:28.683 --> 29:31.019
-[Pope] Right there. Don't move it.
-Okay.

29:32.353 --> 29:34.355
[dramatic music playing]

29:40.612 --> 29:42.238
-[chuckles]
-Holy shit!

29:42.322 --> 29:43.573
-I know, right?
-Holy shit!

29:43.656 --> 29:45.992
-How did you even figure that out?
-It's so freaking cool!

29:46.075 --> 29:47.202
Wait, do it again.

29:49.662 --> 29:52.874
"Path to the tomb begins
in the island room."

29:53.374 --> 29:55.960
"Path to the tomb begins
in the island room." What does that mean?

29:56.044 --> 29:59.005
So, I'm… I'm pretty sure that it has
something to do with Denmark Tanny

29:59.631 --> 30:00.507
and an angel.

30:01.090 --> 30:03.301
'Cause I… I remember
Lim… Limbrey saying something

30:03.384 --> 30:05.220
about an angel
and how the key led to the cross.

30:05.303 --> 30:08.223
Pope, this is insane.
You're a freaking genius.

30:08.932 --> 30:09.808
Thank you.

30:09.891 --> 30:10.892
[exhales deeply]

30:11.434 --> 30:13.645
Kind of makes you wonder
what the island room is.

30:19.400 --> 30:21.569
Waiting on your call, John B.

30:21.653 --> 30:23.613
[sighs]

30:23.696 --> 30:24.781
Come on, buddy.

30:27.784 --> 30:28.743
[siren chirps]

30:38.795 --> 30:41.923
-[engine turns off]
-[indistinct chattering on radio]

30:42.006 --> 30:42.841
[officer] Hmm.

30:43.591 --> 30:46.052
I hate when it's slow like this, you know?

30:47.720 --> 30:48.930
Tell me about it, man.

30:49.013 --> 30:50.723
Hey, what happened to Ricky?

30:51.391 --> 30:52.225
He bang out?

30:54.936 --> 30:56.896
[exhales] Something like that.

30:58.648 --> 31:01.776
[woman on radio] One three Eddie.
We got an unknown at KC Detention.

31:02.527 --> 31:06.906
Uh, yeah, ten-four. I'll be right there.
Thank you so much. Over.

31:08.533 --> 31:11.619
Duty calls. I'll see you later, Officer.
Uh, you have a good night, though, okay?

31:11.703 --> 31:13.079
-[engine starts]
-[officer] Hold up.

31:13.913 --> 31:15.957
I got nothing to do. I'll pace you.

31:17.041 --> 31:19.168
[sirens blares]

31:19.252 --> 31:20.545
[engine starts]

31:22.547 --> 31:24.215
[sirens wailing]

31:28.511 --> 31:29.345
[Sarah] Wheezie?

31:32.098 --> 31:33.308
Come on, Wheeze.

31:36.978 --> 31:37.896
Is that you?

31:38.479 --> 31:39.314
[chuckles]

31:39.814 --> 31:40.690
Wheeze?

31:41.482 --> 31:43.526
[ominous music playing]

31:43.610 --> 31:44.694
Nah, not Wheezie.

31:44.777 --> 31:47.322
-Where the hell is Wheezie?
-[Rafe] Don't worry about it.

31:48.072 --> 31:49.115
Listen-- Whoa.

31:50.867 --> 31:52.285
It's all good. I… I just…

31:55.538 --> 31:57.707
I just… I needed
to talk to you, like, a little bit.

31:58.458 --> 32:00.627
-Is that okay?
-Don't come near me.

32:00.710 --> 32:03.171
'Cause… 'cause what you do,
Sarah, affects me, okay?

32:03.254 --> 32:05.298
You don't…
you don't think of that, do you?

32:05.381 --> 32:07.216
You shot me, Rafe.

32:09.260 --> 32:11.554
That's it, right?
It's… it's always my fault, right?

32:11.638 --> 32:16.225
Like, uh… you know, I… I wanna keep
what's mine, that I got by my work,

32:16.309 --> 32:18.853
and I'm the bad guy
for trying to… to hold on to it?

32:18.937 --> 32:19.979
It's not yours.

32:20.063 --> 32:22.690
Like I'm wrong
to protect what's mine, huh?

32:26.027 --> 32:27.820
[softly] Listen to me, okay?

32:28.613 --> 32:31.491
The cops are going to talk to you, and…

32:34.243 --> 32:36.746
And I need to make sure
the story's straight because--

32:36.829 --> 32:37.830
You killed Peterkin.

32:40.249 --> 32:41.709
My story's straight.

32:43.211 --> 32:45.630
Listen, this would go
so much better for you if you would--

32:45.713 --> 32:48.549
-Who are trying to protect here? Huh?
-I'm trying to do the right thing.

32:48.633 --> 32:50.551
-You're trying to do the right thing?
-I can't--

32:50.635 --> 32:53.262
You doing the right thing--
No, you're not listening to me.

32:53.346 --> 32:56.808
You doing the right thing
is the reason that you got shot.

32:56.891 --> 32:58.351
Because you were following John B.

32:58.434 --> 33:01.312
John B might get the death penalty
because of you!

33:01.396 --> 33:03.523
That! That right there.

33:03.606 --> 33:06.401
That's… that's exactly
what I'm talking about, Sarah.

33:07.610 --> 33:08.569
You know?

33:12.782 --> 33:14.200
You've always been against me.

33:14.867 --> 33:17.161
-No. I haven't.
-[Rafe] Don't shake your head.

33:17.245 --> 33:18.371
And you still are.

33:19.539 --> 33:20.873
No, no, no, no.

33:21.666 --> 33:24.335
You're not just against me.
You're… you're against us.

33:26.129 --> 33:27.630
We're your family,

33:29.007 --> 33:30.425
and you're against us.

33:32.802 --> 33:36.431
You know,
Dad always takes your side, right?

33:36.514 --> 33:39.350
'Cause you're gonna cry in front of him
like you cried in front of me.

33:40.893 --> 33:45.189
But you listen to me.
I'm a proactive type of person, Sarah.

33:45.273 --> 33:47.900
And we have a problem,
and I gotta solve that problem tonight.

33:47.984 --> 33:49.819
Do you understand?
[yells] Do you understand?

33:49.902 --> 33:51.529
Whoa, whoa, Sarah! Where you going, Sarah?

33:51.612 --> 33:53.614
[dramatic music playing]

34:04.125 --> 34:05.710
You have half an hour till gallery check.

34:05.793 --> 34:07.378
Shut the door when you're done.

34:08.004 --> 34:09.130
Get rid of the key.

34:34.530 --> 34:35.698
Nothing to lose.

34:43.039 --> 34:44.040
[sirens chirps]

34:49.420 --> 34:51.422
[indistinct chattering over radio]

34:55.384 --> 34:59.013
-It's straight ahead to the transfer bay.
-Copy that. Thank you, sir.

34:59.097 --> 35:00.389
[alert buzzes]

35:04.393 --> 35:06.479
[ambulance beeping]

35:11.484 --> 35:12.485
[engine turns off]

35:14.529 --> 35:15.530
All right, load him up.

35:17.740 --> 35:19.033
You gonna get your patient here?

35:20.243 --> 35:23.037
Yeah. Right on.
Yeah, I'm gonna get my patient.

35:23.121 --> 35:24.539
[nurse] Well, come on then.

35:24.622 --> 35:26.165
Am I gonna get my patient?

35:26.749 --> 35:29.377
[sighs] My patient… Of course I am.

35:30.461 --> 35:31.420
Where's Ricky?

35:31.921 --> 35:34.841
Ricky? Uh, food poisoning.

35:34.924 --> 35:37.927
You know, uh,
Ming Dynasty off of Highway 25?

35:38.469 --> 35:41.472
Them egg rolls, dude.
Now, they'll get ya. They'll get you good.

35:41.556 --> 35:43.516
-[sigh]
-Uh, so where's the patient at?

35:43.599 --> 35:46.853
Patient fell out.
No LOC, but he's orthostatic.

35:46.936 --> 35:47.895
Stage 4 lymphoma.

35:47.979 --> 35:50.273
He's been in and out of chemo
for the last three months.

35:53.526 --> 35:54.944
[dramatic music playing]

35:56.988 --> 36:00.366
Uh, is that the only patient
tonight there, ma'am?

36:00.449 --> 36:03.077
[chuckles] Why?
You wanna take more than one tonight?

36:03.161 --> 36:06.706
I mean, I would if I had to.
That's what I'm trying to say. Uh…

36:06.789 --> 36:07.790
Shit.

36:09.000 --> 36:13.212
I was just thinking that I was called in
because my patient had appendicitis.

36:13.296 --> 36:14.172
No? Okay.

36:14.255 --> 36:15.506
This is our only patient.

36:16.382 --> 36:18.801
-[JJ] Right.
-[nurse] Where did you say you work?

36:21.846 --> 36:23.681
Dare County, ma'am.

36:23.764 --> 36:26.434
I worked over there. Never seen you.

36:26.517 --> 36:29.145
Well, that's 'cause, you know,
I just moved up in the ranks so fast.

36:29.228 --> 36:31.939
Look, I would love to sit and chat,
but we gotta get moving, all right?

36:32.023 --> 36:33.608
We gotta get our patient to the hospital.

36:33.691 --> 36:35.818
[inmate] JJ, is that you?

36:39.822 --> 36:41.073
He's delusional as shit.

36:41.157 --> 36:42.658
[keys jingling]

36:42.742 --> 36:43.576
[JJ] Um…

36:43.659 --> 36:45.494
[scraping]

36:46.078 --> 36:47.997
We just got different rigs up in New Bern.

36:48.664 --> 36:50.833
Uh, that's not gonna work. I think it's…

36:50.917 --> 36:52.752
There it is. Ah, there you go.

36:52.835 --> 36:55.504
-[phone ringing]
-[JJ] All right, um…

36:55.588 --> 36:56.589
There you go.

36:56.672 --> 36:58.966
All right, let's get him on up there.

36:59.050 --> 37:01.802
-[officer straining] Let's go.
-[phone ringing]

37:01.886 --> 37:03.554
[officer] Get in there. [grunts]

37:03.638 --> 37:05.014
So, where is your partner?

37:05.097 --> 37:07.308
[phone continues ringing]

37:07.391 --> 37:09.018
I told you. Egg rolls.

37:09.101 --> 37:11.437
Who's gonna look after your patient
if you're driving?

37:11.520 --> 37:13.481
[phone continues ringing]

37:13.564 --> 37:16.150
Well, they told me
that the officer could drive.

37:16.234 --> 37:18.402
No, he's an inmate.
I gotta be in the back.

37:18.486 --> 37:21.322
Wait, hold on, officer. You're saying
that you're gonna be responsible

37:21.405 --> 37:24.492
for me not taking care of my patient.
Is that what you're telling me?

37:24.575 --> 37:28.829
Because look at him.
He's weak, feeble, and pale and shit.

37:28.913 --> 37:32.291
And I gotta do medical stuff on him,
or else we're gonna lose him, okay?

37:32.792 --> 37:34.168
You don't want that on your hands.

37:35.336 --> 37:36.337
This didn't happen.

37:37.380 --> 37:38.798
-All right, let's go.
-Yep.

37:40.132 --> 37:40.967
[grunts]

37:43.469 --> 37:44.637
[phone ringing]

37:45.179 --> 37:46.013
Loading bay.

37:50.059 --> 37:52.603
[nurse] No. They're actually driving
out of here right now.

37:54.730 --> 37:56.440
A lot to lose, actually.

37:58.484 --> 37:59.360

[woman on radio] Be advised,
a 10-63 in progress.

38:06.784 --> 38:09.578
I repeat, a 10-63 in progress.
Do you copy?

38:09.662 --> 38:11.414
-[radio beeps]
-Copy.

38:11.497 --> 38:13.499
[woman] Continue with the patient
onto the hospital.

38:13.582 --> 38:16.961
-We have backup on the way. Do you copy?
-[officer] I read. Ten-four.

38:17.044 --> 38:18.963
[clears throat] Officer,
everything good up there?

38:21.007 --> 38:21.966
Officer.

-[grunts]
-Rafe, Rafe, stop!

38:31.934 --> 38:33.978
It's… it's… it's Sarah.

38:34.061 --> 38:38.232
[hyperventilating]
It's your sister. Please… please don't.

38:38.316 --> 38:40.526
What about me? Huh?

38:41.110 --> 38:42.403
You'd have me fry.

38:43.863 --> 38:44.864
No!

39:02.465 --> 39:04.216
-You brought this on yourself.
-Rafe! Rafe!

39:04.300 --> 39:05.843
This is on you! Your decisions.

39:07.178 --> 39:08.721
[sirens blaring]

39:09.889 --> 39:11.891
[JJ] Come on, Kie. I need a miracle.
