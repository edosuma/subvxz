WEBVTT

00:05.422 --> 00:08.299
I can't believe you met
when my mom treated you in Afghanistan.

00:08.383 --> 00:11.511
-What was your injury?
-I got shot in the face.

00:15.932 --> 00:17.350
Dang!

00:18.643 --> 00:19.853
A tequila shot.

00:21.271 --> 00:24.399
But it really burned.
And it got my shirt all wet.

00:25.400 --> 00:26.860
My hero.

00:26.943 --> 00:31.281
Thank you, Lydia. If you were my medic,
I would've faked an injury.

00:31.364 --> 00:34.367
Stop it, Max. Just kidding. Don't.

00:35.285 --> 00:37.954
Yeah. Even though you are the embodiment
of the alpha male,

00:38.038 --> 00:40.373
which normally I find... [retches]

00:41.416 --> 00:44.377
Looking at you up close
with your chiseled features

00:44.461 --> 00:46.880
and your blue-green eyes
with speckles of gold...

00:47.422 --> 00:48.590
I get it.

00:51.259 --> 00:52.469
I like it here.

00:53.470 --> 00:57.515
Okay. Can my mother and my daughter
please stop trying to seduce  my  boyfriend?

01:00.477 --> 01:03.063
It's kind of annoying how easy it was
for you to charm them.

01:03.146 --> 01:05.857
[groans] I'm off my game.
Took me the whole dinner.

01:05.940 --> 01:08.151
With you, it was three minutes
of small talk, then, boom.

01:08.234 --> 01:11.654
Okay, yeah. I was there. Yeah.

01:11.738 --> 01:13.114
Well, it's your turn next week.

01:13.198 --> 01:16.242
Elaine and Bernie Ferraro
are excited to meet you.

01:17.160 --> 01:20.288
Heads up, my dad's been listening
to Spanish language tapes,

01:20.371 --> 01:22.207
so I'm not sure what that's gonna be.

01:23.833 --> 01:27.504
My mother almost open-mouth kissed you,
so the bar is low.

01:28.671 --> 01:30.215
-[cell phone chimes]
-Oh.

01:30.298 --> 01:31.174
I got it.

01:33.384 --> 01:38.348
-"Pill time"?
-Yeah. That is a reminder for somebody.

01:38.431 --> 01:39.265
Mami!

01:39.349 --> 01:40.225
[exclaims]

01:40.809 --> 01:42.685
Don't forget to take your pill!

01:43.728 --> 01:46.022
She's old,
so she's got to take a lot of stuff.

01:46.105 --> 01:48.108
She's forgetful,
so the reminder's on my phone.

01:48.191 --> 01:49.901
She doesn't know how to use this thing.

01:50.026 --> 01:53.446
Okay. So,  Mami,
you'll remember to take your pill, right?

01:54.531 --> 01:56.199
In the mouth this time?

01:58.493 --> 02:03.665
Sí. Sí,  of course.
I take pills because I am so forgetful.

02:05.458 --> 02:07.460
Where am I? This is not Cuba.

02:10.922 --> 02:12.340
-Okay.
-[Penelope] That's great.

02:12.423 --> 02:14.259
-Okay,  Mami,  could you...
-Okay.

02:14.968 --> 02:18.096
Okay. Thank you. I'm so sorry.

02:18.179 --> 02:20.265
I don't want Max to know
I'm on antidepressants.

02:20.348 --> 02:23.685
Oh,  pero,  of course you don't want
to tell him. It's humiliating.

02:24.686 --> 02:27.438
-It's not humiliating.
-Oh, no? Then I will tell him.

02:27.522 --> 02:29.983
Oh, shut your mouth!
Or I'll tell him you don't have eyebrows!

02:30.066 --> 02:31.526
[gasps]

02:33.069 --> 02:36.030
Okay. You got me by the  cojones
and I respect it.

02:37.115 --> 02:40.827
Hey, how about we both go off our pills?

02:41.411 --> 02:43.079
And there will be so much more room

02:43.163 --> 02:46.541
in the medicine cabinet
for rouge and lipstick.

02:46.624 --> 02:48.459
Things we really need.

02:48.543 --> 02:53.047
-Mami,  your pills are to prevent a stroke.
-A stroke is all up here.

02:54.215 --> 02:58.386
-You need to keep taking those pills.
-Okay! I'll stay a druggie.

02:58.469 --> 03:01.681
-But I need some help. Max?
-¿Sí?

03:02.640 --> 03:04.601
I have to take a pill.

03:04.684 --> 03:09.689
But as we both know, I am old and weak,
so can you carry me to the bathroom?

03:12.984 --> 03:14.235
Okay.

03:22.368 --> 03:24.370
[theme song playing]

04:11.709 --> 04:14.963
My panic attacks are starting to come
at some weird places, y'all.

04:15.046 --> 04:16.089
I don't get it,

04:16.172 --> 04:19.133
because when I was a gunner
I made 100 decisions a second.

04:19.217 --> 04:21.970
But yesterday, I was in the cookie aisle
and I was sweating.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.389
Too many options.

04:24.472 --> 04:27.684
Next thing you know,
I'm hyperventilating in a bag of Milanos.

04:28.184 --> 04:29.727
Then I had to buy those.

04:30.520 --> 04:33.898
-And I don't have no money for Milanos.
-[all laugh]

04:35.024 --> 04:38.695
Okay, this is why you need to keep using
the coping tools we've been talking about.

04:38.778 --> 04:41.614
Meditation, exercise, doing service...

04:41.698 --> 04:45.243
Or maybe just stay out of the snack aisle,
girl! [laughs]

04:45.326 --> 04:47.578
I'm sorry, Pam. Tools are great.

04:48.329 --> 04:50.164
I don't even realize I'm in a bad place

04:50.248 --> 04:52.500
until I'm bingeing
Keeping Up with the Kardashians

04:52.583 --> 04:54.627
and I'm weeping.

04:54.711 --> 04:58.298
God! I feel bad for those people
and I definitely should not.

04:59.841 --> 05:03.052
Yes. Sometimes our brains lie to us.

05:03.136 --> 05:07.307
I knew I needed help when
I heard a recording of myself played back.

05:07.390 --> 05:11.853
I was wasted, slurring obscenities
at a toaster about my abandonment issues.

05:12.353 --> 05:16.149
I did the same thing!
Except, instead of a toaster it was a cop.

05:18.568 --> 05:22.113
Recording our thoughts
is a very useful tool.

05:22.196 --> 05:25.325
Hearing them played back
gives you some perspective,

05:25.408 --> 05:26.868
as though someone else were talking.

05:26.951 --> 05:29.704
So, like, "Hello, Penelope.
It's me, Penelope"?

05:30.246 --> 05:34.125
-That sounds stupid.
-Yeah, that sounds stupid, Pam.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.128
Trust me. It helps.

05:37.962 --> 05:42.258
Wait, you haven't shared yet today,
Penelope. Which, for you, is unusual.

05:42.341 --> 05:45.887
Well, I gotta be honest, guys,
I'm feeling great.

05:45.970 --> 05:49.390
And my toolbox is closed
and under the bed.

05:49.474 --> 05:52.602
Well, it's wonderful to hear
that you're doing so well, but--

05:52.685 --> 05:55.146
No, not just "well." Freaking fantastic!

05:55.229 --> 05:58.066
Like, school, work, the kids...
It's all amazing.

05:58.149 --> 05:59.984
Plus, she's got a hot new boyfriend.

06:00.068 --> 06:02.987
Speaking of tools gathering dust
under my bed!

06:03.071 --> 06:05.823
[laughs] Yes, girl, yes!

06:05.907 --> 06:09.410
But, no, no, no! Come on!
He's more than that. He is.

06:09.494 --> 06:11.662
I'm actually gonna
meet his parents next week.

06:11.746 --> 06:13.581
And my family loves him.

06:13.664 --> 06:15.083
And I'm gonna stop talking

06:15.166 --> 06:17.919
because it looks like Ramona
might wanna punch me in the face.

06:19.504 --> 06:21.047
You're not wrong.

06:23.007 --> 06:24.592
But I'm happy for you.

06:27.929 --> 06:31.432
-Hello!
-Hi! Hello,  Mami!

06:35.728 --> 06:36.938
Okay.

06:38.773 --> 06:41.359
Are you going to put me in a home?

06:41.984 --> 06:45.822
-No,  Mami,  we don't do that.
-That's right! We don't!

06:45.905 --> 06:50.159
And if you ever do,
papito  has instructions to break me out.

06:51.494 --> 06:53.871
Relax. I just really need your advice
on something.

06:53.955 --> 06:56.374
Okay,  mi vida.
What problem can I solve for you?

06:56.457 --> 07:00.169
Well, I'm meeting Max's parents soon
and I want to make a good impression.

07:00.253 --> 07:05.216
-So you want me to come?
-No. I need you to tell me...

07:06.092 --> 07:06.926
what to wear!

07:07.009 --> 07:07.969
[Lydia speaks Spanish]

07:08.052 --> 07:10.930
Okay. This one shows off my  tetas,
this one shows off my  nalgas,

07:11.013 --> 07:12.598
but we can find one that shows off both.

07:12.682 --> 07:15.393
Ah,  sí!  Give the people what they want!

07:15.476 --> 07:17.812
-[whoops]
-[both laugh]

07:17.895 --> 07:20.022
Maybe we can go
dress shopping Tuesday night.

07:20.106 --> 07:23.234
Perfect! Oh, no! Isn't that when
you're having your cuckoo party?

07:24.610 --> 07:26.070
You mean group therapy?

07:26.821 --> 07:30.366
Yeah, well,
actually, I've decided to stop going.

07:31.075 --> 07:31.993
[gasps]

07:32.076 --> 07:35.580
If I hadn't been taking my medication
like you told me to,

07:35.663 --> 07:37.373
I would be having a stroke.

07:37.874 --> 07:39.167
-[cackles]
-Come on!

07:40.168 --> 07:43.421
Therapy served its purpose
and I'm really glad I did it, but...

07:43.671 --> 07:45.715
I'm feeling like myself again.

07:45.798 --> 07:49.093
Now I have more time for the kids
and for you and me to hang out.

07:49.177 --> 07:50.344
Let's go shopping!

07:51.262 --> 07:53.139
I might need a new lipstick.

07:58.060 --> 08:01.981
-What's the matter? Are you tearing up?
-[cries] You really are my daughter.

08:03.733 --> 08:07.737
There was a period of ten seconds
when the doctor took you out of the room

08:07.820 --> 08:09.739
and I have always wondered.

08:13.034 --> 08:14.118
But no more!

08:14.202 --> 08:15.828
-[cries]
-[chuckles]

08:17.538 --> 08:20.750
-[Penelope] Thanks, Sister Barbara.
-Great CPR presentation, Mom.

08:20.833 --> 08:23.211
Yeah, Mom, the presentation was amazing.

08:23.294 --> 08:27.048
If this whole thing wasn't
about saving lives, I'd say you killed it.

08:27.131 --> 08:32.011
It could not have gone better.
Somebody asked me if I was your sister.

08:32.094 --> 08:33.721
[chuckles]

08:33.804 --> 08:35.973
Somebody asked if you were a sister.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.352
As in of Christ.

08:39.435 --> 08:43.022
Why do you feel the need
to ruin people's joy?

08:44.982 --> 08:46.943
I went too far
with the Sister Barbara joke.

08:47.026 --> 08:47.902
No!

08:47.985 --> 08:50.238
Are you kidding?
Everyone thought it was hilarious.

08:50.321 --> 08:52.198
Yeah. Even Sister Barbara laughed.

08:52.281 --> 08:54.951
I had never seen her teeth.
I always assumed she had fangs.

08:56.077 --> 08:57.620
It's not cool. It's disrespectful.

08:57.703 --> 09:00.998
Teachers have it hard enough,
and then I make a joke at her expense?

09:01.082 --> 09:03.251
Like, "Great! Make a teacher
feel bad about her job.

09:03.334 --> 09:04.502
Nice work, Penelope."

09:05.127 --> 09:07.630
Mom, you did great. Don't worry.

09:07.713 --> 09:11.509
-I don't think before I speak.
-Who does that?

09:13.177 --> 09:15.346
Yeah, Mom, it's all good. Let's go eat.

09:15.429 --> 09:17.348
-We'll go get our stuff.
-Okay.

09:19.058 --> 09:21.018
Mami,
why don't you take the kids without me?

09:21.102 --> 09:23.688
-Huh?
-Yeah. I'm kinda amped up, and--

09:23.771 --> 09:25.398
You know what? I'm gonna go for a run.

09:26.065 --> 09:27.400
What? Why?

09:27.483 --> 09:30.403
I've wanted to get back into exercising
and now I have time.

09:30.486 --> 09:32.280
-I'm just gonna jog home.
-Now?

09:32.363 --> 09:34.073
Yeah! It's only a mile and a half.

09:39.662 --> 09:41.205
-Oh, hey, Pen!
-Hey.

09:41.289 --> 09:42.623
Wow, you're all sweaty.

09:43.374 --> 09:46.460
Oh, my God! If you joined an
adult kickball team after saying

09:46.544 --> 09:50.089
you were too busy to join mine,
you are on a long road to forgiveness.

09:50.172 --> 09:54.010
-[sniffles, panting] I went running.
-Is someone chasing you?

09:55.344 --> 09:58.723
-Oh, my God, are they still here?
-What? No.

09:59.265 --> 10:00.933
[cell phone chimes]

10:01.017 --> 10:03.436
Max, stop. I can't talk to you right now.

10:04.186 --> 10:08.316
You don't want to talk to Max?
What's wrong with you?

10:08.399 --> 10:10.443
Do you know how hard it is
to get him on the phone?

10:10.526 --> 10:12.445
I've left like 60 voicemails.

10:14.030 --> 10:15.698
I'm just in a weird mood.

10:15.781 --> 10:17.908
I messed up the presentation
at the kids' school,

10:17.992 --> 10:19.577
verbally abused a nun.

10:19.660 --> 10:21.412
I'm adjusting to being off my meds.

10:21.495 --> 10:24.498
I'm having caffeine late in the day.
I'm just a little stressed out.

10:25.583 --> 10:28.961
Definitely want to hear
about the verbal nun smackdown.

10:29.712 --> 10:30.963
But you're off your meds?

10:31.047 --> 10:33.341
-Like your antidepressants?
-Yeah.

10:33.966 --> 10:35.092
Wow...

10:35.176 --> 10:38.137
Your mom said you stopped
going to therapy, but this, too, huh?

10:38.346 --> 10:40.890
So your doctor thought
you were ready or...

10:40.973 --> 10:43.142
Didn't do it through my doctor.
It was time. It's fine.

10:43.225 --> 10:47.980
Sure, sure, sure.
But is that really a DIY situation?

10:49.565 --> 10:54.195
-I'm a nurse. I know what I'm doing.
-Do you know you just ran a 5K in scrubs?

10:54.278 --> 10:56.113
Why am I talking to you about this anyway?

10:56.197 --> 10:58.574
Your idea of stress is
when your chest waxer goes out of town.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.410
Roberto is the only one
who doesn't make it sting!

11:02.328 --> 11:03.954
I would kill to have your problems.

11:04.038 --> 11:06.290
Too much money, too much free time,
too many parents.

11:08.250 --> 11:11.170
I know you're upset,
but you don't have to take it out on me.

11:11.253 --> 11:12.630
-Please.
-Hey.

11:12.713 --> 11:15.257
I've been around enough to know
when people are not okay,

11:15.341 --> 11:17.676
and you don't seem okay.
I get where you're coming from.

11:17.760 --> 11:20.179
You have no idea where I'm coming from!

11:20.262 --> 11:22.056
You've had everything handed to you!

11:22.139 --> 11:24.809
You had to get hooked on drugs
just to be interesting!

11:32.775 --> 11:36.529
You don't sound like yourself.
I'm gonna go.

11:53.003 --> 11:54.588
[Lydia clicks tongue, sighs]

11:55.506 --> 11:57.508
Lupita, wake up.

11:59.760 --> 12:00.678
I'm up.

12:00.761 --> 12:04.140
Bueno,  it's 7:45.
Did you forget to set your alarm?

12:04.223 --> 12:06.600
I'm not gonna go to work today,
'cause I don't feel well.

12:06.976 --> 12:12.273
[scoffs]  ¿Y?  I once went to work
with a temperature of 104.

12:12.356 --> 12:15.151
I was delirious
and no one even noticed a difference.

12:16.652 --> 12:19.613
I can miss work for one day,  Mami.

12:20.865 --> 12:22.241
You don't feel fever-y.

12:22.324 --> 12:26.454
I don't feel well. I know my body.
Please, just let me sleep.

12:28.247 --> 12:29.248
Okay,  mija.

12:40.009 --> 12:44.013
I made you some  sopa  with  fideos.

12:45.723 --> 12:46.640
I'm not hungry.

12:47.433 --> 12:51.437
Okay. Let's cure this once and for all.

12:53.439 --> 12:56.400
This cannot be cured with Vicks VapoRub.

12:56.484 --> 12:58.861
Everything can be cured
with Vicks VapoRub!

13:00.112 --> 13:04.450
It cured your  Tía  Neni's appendicitis.

13:05.034 --> 13:06.786
Her appendix was removed.

13:06.869 --> 13:09.413
Who's to say which treatment
helped her the most?

13:10.873 --> 13:14.460
I'm gonna go back to sleep,  Mami.
I'm tired.

13:17.213 --> 13:20.216
[speaks Spanish, sighs]

13:20.299 --> 13:22.218
I'll leave this right here.

13:27.389 --> 13:29.016
Good, you're up!

13:29.642 --> 13:33.729
I hemmed your dress
so it's ready for tonight!

13:34.313 --> 13:37.191
It's sexy but not too sexy.

13:37.274 --> 13:41.820
Max's father will love you
and his mother will still respect you.

13:44.532 --> 13:45.866
[speaks Spanish]

13:48.577 --> 13:50.538
What is wrong?  Por favor.

13:54.833 --> 13:57.169
I shouldn't have bought that dress.
It was stupid.

13:57.253 --> 14:00.548
I spent too much money. Now it's hemmed,
and I can't take it back.

14:01.549 --> 14:06.887
-No, it's okay. You deserve a nice dress.
-No, I don't.

14:07.930 --> 14:08.973
[exhales deeply]

14:10.683 --> 14:12.643
I can't do this. I'm not gonna go tonight.

14:13.894 --> 14:14.770
What?

14:16.689 --> 14:19.900
Tell me what to do. Let me help you.

14:21.110 --> 14:22.403
You can't help me.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.993
I don't understand what's happening.

14:29.910 --> 14:31.704
Everything is so good!

14:32.413 --> 14:38.794
I mean,  papito  is perfection.
Elena is... very smart.

14:39.670 --> 14:43.382
Max is an Adonis who loves you.
And then there is me!

14:44.258 --> 14:46.760
Your life is full of blessings.

14:46.844 --> 14:49.471
[shakily] I know.
Mami,  believe me! I know!

14:49.555 --> 14:52.099
Please, could you just leave me alone?

14:57.396 --> 14:59.773
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

15:01.025 --> 15:03.777
It has been a week
since my last confession.

15:06.697 --> 15:10.993
There is something wrong with my daughter.
And I don't know what happened.

15:11.952 --> 15:16.332
She was doing so well that she stopped
going to therapy, finally.

15:16.832 --> 15:20.377
Things have never been better
between my daughter and me.

15:20.461 --> 15:22.796
And now I can't get her out of bed!

15:22.880 --> 15:25.466
-Did you try the Vicks VapoRub?
-[scoffs]

15:26.258 --> 15:27.176
Of course!

15:28.218 --> 15:29.762
So your daughter is depressed?

15:29.845 --> 15:33.933
Oh, oh, yes, yes.
She's even taking medication for it.

15:34.016 --> 15:36.810
You know, I don't understand these things.

15:36.894 --> 15:40.189
Depression, anxiety, OCD...

15:41.190 --> 15:43.108
I was just thinking about them
the other night

15:43.192 --> 15:46.987
when I got up at 3:00 a.m. to do my makeup
and clean the sponges.

15:49.949 --> 15:54.244
Well, just because
you don't feel those things, uh,

15:54.328 --> 15:56.830
doesn't mean they aren't real for her.

15:59.875 --> 16:03.587
I wish I could take away her pain
and feel it for myself.

16:04.213 --> 16:06.340
That is what mothers are for.

16:06.840 --> 16:12.638
Señora,  taking on
someone else's suffering is not possible.

16:12.721 --> 16:14.598
But is that not what Jesus did?

16:15.557 --> 16:16.558
Okay.

16:19.853 --> 16:21.438
Good point.

16:22.398 --> 16:26.860
I mean, you can't know and fix everything,
including your daughter.

16:27.987 --> 16:32.950
You can only be there for her
while she fixes herself.

16:35.911 --> 16:39.498
Thank you, Padre José. I will try.

16:39.581 --> 16:43.168
Good. And remember, you are not God.

16:43.585 --> 16:47.631
Ay...  I know that is true,
but it's still hard to hear.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.685
Hello, Penelope.

17:01.311 --> 17:03.105
It's me, Penelope.

17:04.189 --> 17:05.149
[scoffs]

17:06.233 --> 17:07.109
[sighs]

17:07.693 --> 17:09.028
This is so stupid.

17:10.779 --> 17:12.156
[knocking at door]

17:18.662 --> 17:24.126
Oh, hi. You here to yell at me more?
Maybe insult one of my mothers?

17:27.004 --> 17:30.049
Whoa. Whoa. Hey! Hey.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.259
What's going on?

17:37.514 --> 17:41.060
I did this thing where
I recorded myself thinking out loud.

17:43.145 --> 17:44.730
Can you just listen with me, please?

17:49.359 --> 17:52.863
[over speakers]  Hello, Penelope.
It's me Penelope.

17:53.238 --> 17:54.239
[scoffs]

17:54.573 --> 17:56.283
This is so stupid.

17:56.366 --> 17:58.952
Isn't it so weird
to hear your own voice out loud?

18:00.788 --> 18:03.457
You want me to listen to the whole thing
and then comment? Gotcha.

18:08.796 --> 18:10.672
[Penelope over speakers]  I can't sleep.

18:13.383 --> 18:18.764
It literally feels like the weight
of my life is sitting on my chest.

18:19.348 --> 18:20.182
[exhales]

18:23.310 --> 18:25.312
And then I see those kids...

18:27.439 --> 18:28.482
[exhales]

18:29.525 --> 18:31.527
Those beautiful kids...

18:33.320 --> 18:35.280
and I'm so tired.

18:43.413 --> 18:45.749
Maybe too tired to be what they need.

18:52.506 --> 18:58.387
[crying] I want so badly for them
to grow up and live full, happy lives.

19:00.097 --> 19:03.934
But I can't teach them how to do that

19:04.017 --> 19:06.520
because I don't know
how to do that myself.

19:12.734 --> 19:16.029
I'm failing them. I'm failing them.

19:17.447 --> 19:19.366
They deserve so much better than me.

19:21.660 --> 19:25.664
It's like when people tell me,
"Be happy. You have a great life."

19:25.747 --> 19:29.668
It makes me feel like garbage
because I know.

19:31.295 --> 19:35.132
But what's wrong with me
that I can't appreciate that?

19:36.008 --> 19:37.467
That I can't feel it?

19:41.597 --> 19:44.975
And what's the point of living
if you can't feel anything?

19:45.350 --> 19:46.435
[sighs]

19:49.897 --> 19:51.356
You were right.

19:53.066 --> 19:55.068
That woman is not okay.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.783
I know what the last part sounds like,

20:01.867 --> 20:04.161
but I promise
I would never do anything like that.

20:04.244 --> 20:05.245
I know.

20:08.290 --> 20:11.877
But I think you know that healthy brains
don't go to that place.

20:14.796 --> 20:16.006
[sighs]

20:17.549 --> 20:19.134
You need to go back on your meds.

20:19.218 --> 20:23.138
I don't want to be on a drug
for the rest of my life!

20:23.222 --> 20:25.140
I shouldn't have to need it!

20:25.974 --> 20:29.394
I shouldn't have to need these either,
but I do. To see.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.314
And to look rugged but also smart.

20:34.608 --> 20:39.071
-It's not the same thing.
-Oh, no? Okay. Wanna go for a drive?

20:47.871 --> 20:50.624
There's got to be another way
to feel happy.

20:54.002 --> 20:55.003
[sighs]

20:58.173 --> 21:00.801
So it's Fourth of July, 2011.

21:01.969 --> 21:05.013
I'd been sober for a while,
so I thought I'd celebrate with a beer.

21:06.723 --> 21:09.142
Woke up three days later in an alley.

21:10.644 --> 21:12.479
Then the bowling ball hit me.

21:22.489 --> 21:24.616
I was in the gutter for a long time.

21:27.995 --> 21:30.330
It's really slippery without the shoes.

21:34.001 --> 21:36.962
That was the day I truly accepted

21:37.045 --> 21:41.008
that I can't have alcohol or drugs, ever.

21:42.634 --> 21:44.678
Not a beer, not a glass of wine,

21:45.971 --> 21:48.181
not even six hits of acid
at a Grateful Dead show,

21:48.265 --> 21:50.475
no matter how well it makes me dance.

21:54.021 --> 21:56.273
I kinda get where you're coming from.

21:58.692 --> 22:02.529
There's something I want that I can't have
for the rest of my life.

22:05.615 --> 22:07.117
And there's something you don't want

22:08.952 --> 22:12.122
that you have to have
for the rest of yours.

22:23.633 --> 22:27.137
[shakily] I'm really sorry
about all the crap I said to you.

22:27.220 --> 22:28.180
Ah!

22:29.139 --> 22:32.184
I can take it. We're best friends.

22:32.976 --> 22:37.272
[chuckles] Oh, man! I think
you might actually be my best friend.

22:39.024 --> 22:40.525
Now I'm really depressed.

22:52.496 --> 22:54.831
-Hello.
-Ay, Mami!  Jesus!

22:54.915 --> 22:57.667
Mami,  I thought you were a ghost.

22:57.751 --> 23:01.838
Please, you cannot see ghosts.
You do not have the gift.

23:04.716 --> 23:05.842
Why are you still awake?

23:06.009 --> 23:08.512
[scoffs] I was worried about you.

23:08.595 --> 23:11.598
Plus, the kitchen sink
is not going to Fabuloso itself.

23:14.059 --> 23:15.310
Are you feeling better?

23:16.436 --> 23:18.188
Not yet, but I'm gonna be.

23:18.271 --> 23:19.314
Oh?

23:21.483 --> 23:25.570
So, not only did I stop going to therapy,

23:25.654 --> 23:28.532
but I also went off my meds
a few weeks ago.

23:28.615 --> 23:32.077
But I'm gonna go back on them.
And I'm going back to therapy.

23:32.619 --> 23:35.831
I know my Cuban brain
should be able to fight off the crazy

23:35.914 --> 23:37.624
like a matador in a bullfight or whatever.

23:37.707 --> 23:40.252
But,  Mami,  I really...
I don't want to hear it.

23:43.171 --> 23:44.172
Okay.

23:45.215 --> 23:46.049
What?

23:48.552 --> 23:52.556
You do what you need to do
to fix yourself.

23:53.598 --> 23:55.851
And I will be here for you.

23:59.229 --> 24:00.272
Hold on.

24:01.898 --> 24:04.526
Is this some sort of reverse psychology?

24:04.609 --> 24:08.155
[scoffs] No.
I do not believe in psychology.

24:09.990 --> 24:11.074
For me.

24:13.034 --> 24:14.077
Thank you,  Mami.

24:15.662 --> 24:20.584
I love you,  nena,
and I just want you to be happy.

24:28.550 --> 24:29.968
Hi!

24:32.012 --> 24:35.015
Got your text. Glad your phone works.

24:35.640 --> 24:38.101
Could've been useful two days ago
when you stood up my parents.

24:39.227 --> 24:41.688
My dad still insisted
on ordering in Spanish.

24:42.481 --> 24:43.940
We did not get what we wanted.

24:47.694 --> 24:50.280
I hope you'll let me explain
and make it up to you physically.

24:50.864 --> 24:51.907
You have the floor.

25:03.752 --> 25:04.878
I need to tell you something.

25:04.961 --> 25:08.423
After you hear it, you can decide
whether or not you still wanna be with me.

25:09.799 --> 25:10.717
What is it?

25:11.259 --> 25:14.095
You have kids and live with your mom?
'Cause those are deal-breakers.

25:21.853 --> 25:22.729
That...

25:23.980 --> 25:25.357
[sighs] And...

25:28.026 --> 25:31.821
I have depression and anxiety.
And I take medication for it.

25:33.156 --> 25:35.283
And if I don't take the medication,
it's not good.

25:36.284 --> 25:40.247
You're a veteran.
Maybe you get it, maybe you don't.

25:41.790 --> 25:44.543
That's what happened when
I stood you up. I tried to go off and...

25:44.626 --> 25:45.502
[inhales sharply]

25:48.296 --> 25:51.383
Anyway, the meds help me
stay in control of my life.

25:52.217 --> 25:54.219
I'll probably have to be on them forever.

25:59.933 --> 26:01.142
Okay.

26:03.395 --> 26:05.981
So what's the thing that would
make me not wanna be with you?

26:14.990 --> 26:16.408
'Sup, bestie?

26:19.035 --> 26:21.955
Oh... Making out with other bestie.

26:26.793 --> 26:29.713
It's so awkward
when your two best friends start dating.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.056
What do you guys wanna do tonight?

26:40.140 --> 26:42.767
Oh, I got it. Why don't all three of us
Netflix and chill?

26:45.687 --> 26:47.606
[music playing]
