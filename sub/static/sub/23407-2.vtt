00:05.901 --> 00:07.583
What did you say?

00:09.312 --> 00:11.262
This our new house, baby.

00:11.591 --> 00:13.426
That's what I thought you said.

00:14.768 --> 00:16.046
Yes.

00:16.109 --> 00:17.641
Don't you like it?!

00:19.563 --> 00:21.123
Curtis.

00:21.158 --> 00:23.720
I'm still on the part where
you said this is our new house.

00:25.573 --> 00:27.150
Mnh!

00:27.478 --> 00:29.977
Yes! Don't you like it, baby?

00:30.006 --> 00:31.607
Curtis, what are you talking about?

00:32.528 --> 00:34.767
You remember how you
told me to be open-minded?

00:34.892 --> 00:36.277
I'm open-minded, baby.

00:38.078 --> 00:39.166
Boom.

00:39.943 --> 00:41.721
But I need you to be open-minded, too.

00:41.750 --> 00:44.456
Curtis, okay. Okay.

00:44.479 --> 00:46.373
What are you talking about?

00:46.869 --> 00:49.506
Okay, you... you can't hear me, baby?

00:49.631 --> 00:51.244
Think we gonna get these checked.

00:52.505 --> 00:55.389
Baby, this is our new house!

00:55.412 --> 00:56.822
You heard me.

01:00.645 --> 01:04.985
- Whose new house? Whose new house?
- O... ours, baby. Us'.

01:05.992 --> 01:07.362
Surprise.

01:08.433 --> 01:10.269
Okay, wh... what's... what's going on?

01:10.292 --> 01:12.691
No, no. Now, pay attention,
baby, 'cause this gonna get good.

01:16.427 --> 01:18.425
Curtis, what do you mean,
this is our new house?

01:20.093 --> 01:21.286
We moved?

01:22.470 --> 01:25.252
- What?
- Baby, we Flordidians now!

01:28.568 --> 01:30.060
I'm gonna keep my Falcons, though.

01:34.542 --> 01:35.854
Is he crazy?

01:39.087 --> 01:41.907
Oh, come on, Auntie Ella. We been
trying to tell you that for years.

01:44.924 --> 01:46.924
Please tell me you're not
just realizing that now.

01:48.282 --> 01:49.819
You two.

01:50.193 --> 01:51.833
- I'm sorry.
- My bad.

01:52.505 --> 01:54.504
Didn't I tell you not to poke the bear?

01:56.884 --> 01:58.751
Yeah, but you said Uncle
Curtis was the bear.

01:58.953 --> 02:01.095
No. Mama Bear is much worse.

02:03.029 --> 02:04.793
Who you calling a bear?

02:26.833 --> 02:29.717
Curtis, what do you mean,
you bought this house?

02:30.141 --> 02:32.443
Baby, when Uncle Roland passed...

02:32.475 --> 02:33.746
Robert.

02:34.433 --> 02:35.707
Thank you.

02:36.832 --> 02:40.299
They sold me this house for
next to nothing. You heard me?

02:42.406 --> 02:44.479
They should've sold it to you for free.

02:45.572 --> 02:47.524
No, they should've paid him.

02:48.963 --> 02:50.586
You're not helping.

02:52.964 --> 02:54.806
We're not trying to.

02:56.948 --> 02:59.412
Curtis, I'm not leaving Atlanta.

02:59.435 --> 03:01.208
Yes, you are, baby.

03:02.118 --> 03:04.617
- You said you would.
- Wh... when, Curtis?

03:04.628 --> 03:07.978
Baby, don't you remember? You
said you wanted to move to Florida!

03:07.996 --> 03:09.796
Curtis, when did I say that?

03:09.847 --> 03:11.598
1982!

03:12.445 --> 03:14.413
December 16th!

03:14.929 --> 03:16.716
It was a snowy day.

03:20.986 --> 03:23.164
You said you wanted to go to Florida.

03:24.486 --> 03:26.246
Then get some Cuban sandwiches.

03:30.378 --> 03:31.378
Remember?

03:32.731 --> 03:34.943
Curtis, I didn't tell you
I would move to Florida.

03:34.960 --> 03:36.457
I said I would think about it.

03:38.180 --> 03:40.630
You ain't got to think anymore. We here.

03:43.886 --> 03:44.886
I'ma kill him.

03:44.895 --> 03:47.723
- I'ma kill him. I'm gonna kill him dead.
- Ella, Ella,

03:47.764 --> 03:49.441
- you stop. Ella,
- I'm telling you, he going down.

03:49.496 --> 03:51.610
you stop it right now, baby.

03:51.656 --> 03:54.326
Now, you know we promised we would
never fight in front of the kids

03:54.331 --> 03:56.422
or use harsh words.

03:58.407 --> 04:00.670
Y'all been fighting in
front of me since I was born.

04:02.060 --> 04:03.414
Shut the hell up.

04:05.472 --> 04:07.245
Whose side you on, anyway?

04:07.757 --> 04:09.019
Mama's.

04:10.032 --> 04:12.072
- I swear, I'm gonna...
- You know what, unh-unh.

04:12.086 --> 04:13.399
Everybody, I don't want to hear this.

04:13.436 --> 04:15.121
Come on, let's just
go load up in the R.V.

04:15.149 --> 04:16.875
- Come on. We going home.
- You can't.

04:17.899 --> 04:18.949
Why can't we?

04:20.303 --> 04:21.547
Wait till you hear this part.

04:21.851 --> 04:23.517
Is that a pine tree?

04:24.899 --> 04:26.579
Right next to an oak tree?

04:28.514 --> 04:30.577
They have babies, they'd be poke trees.

04:31.406 --> 04:32.948
Little poke trees.

04:33.123 --> 04:34.220
Mnh-mnh.

04:35.016 --> 04:36.407
Boo.

04:37.941 --> 04:40.778
It's a beautiful view,
baby. Just look at the view.

04:40.801 --> 04:43.021
Uncle Curtis, no. That ain't no view.

04:43.601 --> 04:45.186
That ain't no view.

04:45.236 --> 04:46.806
He just trying to oversell this trash.

04:46.825 --> 04:48.211
- It's not gonna work.
- Right.

04:50.228 --> 04:51.739
Et tu, brute?

04:51.928 --> 04:54.001
There's no... there's no view out here.

04:56.976 --> 04:59.021
Tell me why we can't go home.

05:02.315 --> 05:03.632
I sold the house.

05:05.484 --> 05:07.611
- Curtis?
- Yeah, baby?

05:07.634 --> 05:09.513
You sold our house?

05:09.569 --> 05:11.844
Yes, baby. Yes!

05:11.872 --> 05:13.304
Come on, see!

05:17.726 --> 05:19.399
Come on! Come on!

05:21.518 --> 05:23.677
- Calvin, C.J.
- I... I don't want to.

05:23.679 --> 05:25.314
- What is...
- I don't, either.

05:34.028 --> 05:35.464
You sold...

05:36.003 --> 05:37.362
my house?

05:38.965 --> 05:41.406
Curtis, the house I raised my family in?

05:41.922 --> 05:44.331
W... yeah. You want to thank me?

05:47.016 --> 05:49.075
The house with all
of our memories, baby?

05:49.269 --> 05:52.794
- Baby, all of our memories are still with us.
- Eep!

05:53.041 --> 05:54.662
And they ain't that great.

05:56.939 --> 05:58.565
Curtis, I know you kidding me.

05:58.579 --> 06:00.255
I know you kidding me.

06:00.724 --> 06:02.959
- No.
- You better be.

06:03.518 --> 06:06.000
Baby stop being so dramatic.

06:07.957 --> 06:10.145
Come on, that old, dusty
house? Come on, now.

06:10.202 --> 06:13.208
No, this is the dusty house, Curtis!

06:13.830 --> 06:15.857
That is my house!

06:18.315 --> 06:20.514
You mean it was your house.

06:20.745 --> 06:22.127
Boy.

06:24.281 --> 06:25.806
I'm sorry. I'm just gonna back up.

06:27.867 --> 06:29.152
Quickly.

06:29.687 --> 06:31.651
And, uh, even that's too close.

06:31.685 --> 06:33.539
She may look slow, but she's fast.

06:33.943 --> 06:35.186
You're right.

06:35.733 --> 06:37.414
I can hear y'all.

06:40.752 --> 06:42.491
Oh, you can hear that.

06:44.028 --> 06:45.761
Baby, did you see the kitchen?

06:46.423 --> 06:48.161
Did you see the kitchen?

06:49.123 --> 06:50.573
Look at it!

07:00.487 --> 07:02.818
Tell me you did not sell my house.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.687
I can't tell you that, baby.

07:08.149 --> 07:10.895
Without talking to me about it, Curtis?!

07:11.500 --> 07:14.764
Ella, please. All you did was
complain about that house, baby.

07:14.775 --> 07:17.134
- No, I did not.
- Yes, you did!

07:17.259 --> 07:19.615
Baby, you said it had too many memories.

07:21.285 --> 07:22.931
Good memories, Curtis.

07:24.065 --> 07:25.400
- Well, baby...
- You know what, unh-unh!

07:25.418 --> 07:26.704
I don't want to hear this.

07:26.971 --> 07:30.816
Call whoever you sold it to
and tell them I am coming home.

07:30.880 --> 07:33.777
And you are gonna be in the dog house.

07:34.859 --> 07:36.996
I ain't going in that dog house no more!

07:37.794 --> 07:39.037
Baby, where you going?

07:39.060 --> 07:41.811
To the R.V., Curtis. I'm
going to wait in the R.V.

07:41.867 --> 07:44.364
- Come on, kids, everybody.
- Gladly.

07:45.985 --> 07:49.103
Man, I can't believe you sold Auntie
Ella's house right from under her.

07:52.087 --> 07:55.212
I'm gonna take that rug right
from under you and bury you in it.

07:56.692 --> 07:58.787
Well, please, just don't use this rug,

07:58.804 --> 08:00.786
'cause it looks like one big infection.

08:02.519 --> 08:04.045
To the R.V.

08:04.943 --> 08:07.489
- I told you this wouldn't work.
- Why?

08:07.614 --> 08:11.062
Pops, you don't get how
disrespectful this was?

08:11.344 --> 08:13.169
I thought I was doing the right thing.

08:13.226 --> 08:15.195
By not considering her feelings?

08:15.320 --> 08:18.931
- Right. Pops, you got to think about...
- Oh, please.

08:20.146 --> 08:22.777
As many women's hearts
as you done broken?

08:23.393 --> 08:26.140
- You shouldn't be talking to me about nothing.
- Well...

08:27.568 --> 08:29.324
Well, you know what I'm saying.

08:32.582 --> 08:34.102
I thought she'd like it.

08:34.424 --> 08:37.102
I don't understand how
you could've thought that.

08:38.972 --> 08:40.504
I mean, look at this place.

08:41.489 --> 08:43.844
This place is fine,
man. We can fix it up.

08:43.884 --> 08:45.744
We can make this work.

08:46.147 --> 08:49.365
No, no, I think you need to
call whoever sold you this house

08:49.399 --> 08:51.103
and get out the deal.

08:52.271 --> 08:54.137
Don't think I can do that.

08:54.603 --> 08:56.619
Then I think you need a divorce lawyer.

08:56.911 --> 08:59.479
Well, since you know all of them.

09:00.855 --> 09:02.792
I can't believe she's this upset.

09:03.083 --> 09:06.662
Well, Curtis, this is just wrong.

09:06.663 --> 09:09.958
No! This is better for us.

09:10.355 --> 09:13.245
I mean, our bills are lower now,

09:13.654 --> 09:16.791
and we getting an income
coming in from the laundromat.

09:17.274 --> 09:20.488
- Where is this laundromat?
- It's right around the corner.

09:21.668 --> 09:24.356
And it brings in $8,000 a month!

09:24.379 --> 09:25.864
- You heard me?
- What?

09:26.061 --> 09:29.018
- Right.
- Wait, Pops, that's a lot of money.

09:29.143 --> 09:31.131
Doggone Skippy, it's a lot of money!

09:31.983 --> 09:33.962
Man, we could live good.

09:34.158 --> 09:37.014
Ella can relax, and I can
take her on long trips.

09:37.204 --> 09:39.081
Well, why didn't you say that to her?

09:39.306 --> 09:41.633
- You think I should've?
- Yeah.

09:43.458 --> 09:44.788
I thought she'd be happy.

09:44.840 --> 09:46.860
Pops, tell her what you told us.

09:46.860 --> 09:48.651
$8,000 a month would make me happy.

09:49.008 --> 09:51.115
$8 a year would make you happy.

09:52.601 --> 09:53.741
Wait.

09:53.919 --> 09:55.750
Just give her a minute to calm down.

09:55.796 --> 09:57.592
She's fuming right now.

09:57.885 --> 09:59.648
She ain't fuming no more.

10:00.592 --> 10:03.097
- What is she doing?
- The only thing fuming is that R.V.

10:03.111 --> 10:04.257
- She left.
- What?

10:04.280 --> 10:06.162
- Yeah, she kicked me out.
- Why?

10:06.172 --> 10:08.186
'Cause I'm a man. You
know women be trippin'.

10:09.154 --> 10:11.547
- Where she say she was going?
- To Atlanta.

10:11.634 --> 10:13.860
I know she's not leaving me.

10:14.325 --> 10:16.118
I know she not leaving me.

10:16.119 --> 10:17.320
Ella!

10:18.741 --> 10:19.990
Know not me!

10:21.583 --> 10:23.227
I got to get fumigated.

10:24.498 --> 10:27.344
I was itching when I did that.

10:28.979 --> 10:30.761
- What's wrong?
- She gone.

10:39.293 --> 10:42.360
Uh, Auntie Ella, you
should probably slow down.

10:44.630 --> 10:48.121
He just gonna move me and not tell me?

10:48.158 --> 10:49.415
Yeah, I know you're upset.

10:49.429 --> 10:53.505
- You got that right.
- Uh, I'm... I'm telling you, you might want to slow down.

10:53.966 --> 10:56.701
- And sold my house!
- See, that right there was wrong.

10:56.730 --> 10:59.482
You let me get back to
Atlanta and see my house sold.

10:59.529 --> 11:01.302
- I know it.
- I'm telling you right now,

11:01.326 --> 11:04.147
- it's not gonna be good.
- If we make it to Atlanta, with you driving this fast.

11:05.846 --> 11:07.712
- Can you believe him?
- No.

11:07.714 --> 11:08.841
Actually, yes.

11:08.887 --> 11:10.554
Uncle Curtis has been
doing stuff like this

11:10.568 --> 11:12.134
- since y'all been married.
- Little girl, little girl.

11:12.166 --> 11:15.510
Oh. I'm all up in your business, huh?

11:15.538 --> 11:17.362
Yes, you are.

11:18.711 --> 11:20.972
My bad. I'll just...
I'll be back here online.

11:21.373 --> 11:23.865
Like he just gonna move me.

11:24.289 --> 11:26.379
Like I... like I don't
have a voice to speak.

11:26.435 --> 11:27.835
That was just so inconsiderate.

11:27.863 --> 11:30.050
He didn't think about your
stuff, your feelings. He just...

11:30.073 --> 11:31.220
- just did what he wanted to do.
- None of my stuff.

11:31.238 --> 11:32.532
None of your stuff!

11:34.868 --> 11:37.027
- Why are you agreeing with me?
- What?

11:37.244 --> 11:39.477
- Why are you agreeing with me?
- Because you're right.

11:39.505 --> 11:41.126
You're absolutely right.

11:41.251 --> 11:43.484
- I... I know I'm right.
- I know... I know you know you're right.

11:43.498 --> 11:45.889
- I'm not trying to...
- Well, I don't need you to agree with me...

11:45.898 --> 11:48.045
- Okay, I won't agree anymore.
- ... To make sure I'm right.

11:48.068 --> 11:49.164
I am sorry.

11:49.196 --> 11:51.043
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

11:52.871 --> 11:53.860
See, Mom?

11:53.901 --> 11:56.596
That's what happens when you
sit shotgun next to a loaded gun.

11:56.610 --> 11:57.702
You get shot.

11:58.558 --> 12:00.451
Speaking of getting shot, Jazmine.

12:02.059 --> 12:04.518
- Is minding her business. I'm sorry.
- Okay, right, right.

12:04.578 --> 12:05.707
Thank you.

12:05.721 --> 12:07.102
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

12:07.291 --> 12:08.820
Mnh! Did you see that old house?

12:08.830 --> 12:10.695
That... run-down piece of...

12:10.713 --> 12:13.046
Do not get me started on
that house. That thing...

12:13.881 --> 12:15.182
I'm sorry.

12:17.351 --> 12:19.592
- And that big old kitchen.
- That thing was big.

12:19.615 --> 12:21.912
You see those... and we
gonna need new cabinets.

12:21.924 --> 12:23.432
Absolutely.

12:24.567 --> 12:26.326
And paint.

12:26.327 --> 12:27.930
You know how much
paint that's gonna cost?

12:27.948 --> 12:29.680
But you know how much
you like to paint, though.

12:30.808 --> 12:33.478
And the neighborhood, Janine. I
mean, the neighborhood is just like...

12:33.506 --> 12:35.132
It was, it was. But you got church.

12:35.150 --> 12:36.900
That same church was
right there on the corner.

12:38.974 --> 12:40.549
- Oh.
- Uh-huh.

12:42.028 --> 12:44.060
- That's that church that...
- Wait, wait!

12:46.479 --> 12:47.666
Sorry!

12:47.937 --> 12:50.989
Thank you. That's the church.

12:51.114 --> 12:54.204
"We gonna need your help at the church."

12:55.082 --> 12:56.787
- He did not...
- He told her.

12:57.003 --> 12:59.370
- He told her, too.
- Ooh!

12:59.435 --> 13:01.499
Well, you just wait one minute.

13:01.534 --> 13:02.827
Wait, wait, wait, wait! Where we going?

13:02.859 --> 13:04.397
- Where we going?
- Oh.

13:04.429 --> 13:05.912
No, unh-unh.

13:06.230 --> 13:08.740
- They're not glad.
- Where we going?

13:08.759 --> 13:11.583
- To the church.
- Lord, girl, if I don't make it,

13:11.708 --> 13:13.973
it's 'cause the old people
got mad at each other.

13:14.098 --> 13:16.027
Aah!

13:16.152 --> 13:17.437
I ain't gonna make it.

13:25.804 --> 13:27.969
- There she go.
- Okay, just... just be calm, please.

13:27.980 --> 13:30.195
- I'm calm. I'm good.
- You're a Christian.

13:30.250 --> 13:31.497
Joann.

13:31.915 --> 13:34.020
- Hi.
- hi.

13:34.045 --> 13:36.448
Uh, I need to talk to you.

13:36.637 --> 13:37.571
Yeah.

13:37.572 --> 13:39.226
So, Curtis told me

13:39.252 --> 13:41.785
- that he bought Uncle Richard's house.
- Uh, Robert.

13:43.172 --> 13:44.911
- Yeah.
- Who else? Robert...

13:44.941 --> 13:48.268
- he bought his house.
- We were so grateful!

13:48.393 --> 13:51.983
Well, about that, baby. Just...

13:52.015 --> 13:53.383
You want to see what
we did with the money?

13:53.398 --> 13:55.693
I really don't care what
you did with the money.

13:55.785 --> 13:57.426
Look at all these kids.

13:57.459 --> 13:59.600
- You look at all these...
- Aunt Ella.

14:03.589 --> 14:05.555
What's going on with all these kids?

14:05.721 --> 14:08.439
We started an after-school program
to help them stay out of trouble.

14:08.467 --> 14:10.493
Got so much gang violence around here.

14:10.511 --> 14:12.662
And just look... look at
how happy they all are.

14:13.653 --> 14:15.380
This is really kind of nice.

14:15.426 --> 14:18.051
- Mm-hmm. - And I sold
Uncle Robert's house,

14:18.120 --> 14:20.004
and I did all this
myself with the money.

14:20.870 --> 14:23.606
Well, all these kids
about to be out of luck.

14:24.836 --> 14:26.189
Jazmine.

14:27.146 --> 14:31.103
- What? I... I thought you said...
- I said be quiet.

14:31.131 --> 14:32.343
Yes, ma'am. Sorry.

14:32.684 --> 14:35.806
Uh, Ella, this is Nyla.

14:35.817 --> 14:37.975
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

14:38.018 --> 14:39.773
She volunteers here.

14:39.792 --> 14:41.141
Oh. Hi.

14:41.174 --> 14:42.910
Hi, Nyla. I am Ella.

14:43.035 --> 14:45.918
This is Jazmine. She's on vocal rest.

14:46.043 --> 14:48.446
Not to say another word.

14:48.732 --> 14:50.601
- And this is her mother, Janine.
- Hi.

14:50.726 --> 14:54.148
Ah, Nyla's a member of the
church. She's so faithful.

14:54.406 --> 14:56.258
Thank you so much.

14:56.520 --> 14:57.915
Hey, baby.

14:58.201 --> 15:00.406
Hi. Uh, this is my husband.

15:00.862 --> 15:02.162
I need to talk to you.

15:03.226 --> 15:04.396
I'll see you.

15:06.830 --> 15:09.177
- Unh-unh. unh-unh.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:09.366 --> 15:11.351
He just gonna snatch her
out of here like that?

15:11.392 --> 15:13.378
Well, as I said,

15:13.419 --> 15:16.698
we really could use someone
like you in the neighborhood.

15:17.610 --> 15:20.157
So, now, what is it you
want to talk to me about?

15:20.172 --> 15:21.172
Getting her money.

15:21.195 --> 15:23.051
- Oh.
- Mnh!

15:24.313 --> 15:27.960
And, uh, I wanted to see
what I could do to help you.

15:28.010 --> 15:30.487
Oh! That sounds so wonderful!

15:30.506 --> 15:32.809
Oh, and your presence here
would mean a world of difference.

15:32.878 --> 15:34.329
It really, really, really would.

15:34.361 --> 15:36.259
Here, let me finish showing you around.

15:36.581 --> 15:38.061
- I'd like that.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

15:38.084 --> 15:39.819
Does this mean you're staying?

15:40.399 --> 15:42.924
It means she's showing me around.

15:47.405 --> 15:48.649
Stay quiet.

16:01.075 --> 16:04.077
You know, I think we might all
need bullet-proof vests around here.

16:04.096 --> 16:06.219
Oh, please. This
neighborhood ain't that bad.

16:06.265 --> 16:07.919
Huh.

16:07.997 --> 16:10.650
You sure this place is
generating that kind of money?

16:12.506 --> 16:14.137
Yes, I'm sure.

16:14.358 --> 16:15.500
I don't see how.

16:15.537 --> 16:17.219
We'll clean it up, that's all.

16:17.344 --> 16:19.664
Yeah, and a tear-down
notice from the city.

16:20.511 --> 16:22.100
Come on, let's check it out.

Keep people like you from getting in.

17:05.002 --> 17:07.718
- Who are you?
- I'm the manager.

17:07.943 --> 17:11.483
Well, I'm the owner, and
that trumps the manager.

17:11.540 --> 17:13.584
I'm the manager that trumps the owner,

17:13.617 --> 17:15.851

Double tap.

17:20.907 --> 17:23.165

Okay, you ain't got to spit.

You fired three times.
