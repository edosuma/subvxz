00:20.430 --> 00:22.150
No. No, thanks.

00:24.719 --> 00:26.239
You have it.

00:28.310 --> 00:29.670
Or don't. Whatever.

00:36.835 --> 00:38.754
Is there something wrong
with the ice cream?

00:38.755 --> 00:42.435
Eat the ice cream, Joel, before it melts.

00:55.894 --> 00:58.693
I said for a cash transfer
this size to be anonymous...

00:58.694 --> 01:00.453
You said... you said come back in an hour.

01:00.454 --> 01:01.773
I have a plane to catch.

01:01.774 --> 01:03.879
No, no, no, I said I would call you back

01:03.980 --> 01:06.425
- when the time comes.
- Look, Mr. Padilla.

01:06.426 --> 01:06.887
Padilla.

01:06.888 --> 01:08.933
I'm a certified financial consultant.

01:08.958 --> 01:10.517
- Do you know what that means?
- No.

01:10.518 --> 01:12.837
What we're talking about
here is not very complicated.

01:12.838 --> 01:14.277
You ever done this before?

01:14.278 --> 01:15.837
Well, it is common for Americans
to come down here

01:15.838 --> 01:17.557
to Guatemala for this kind of transfer.

01:17.558 --> 01:19.237
I don't believe it is legal in the U.S.

01:19.238 --> 01:21.037
Not true... exactly.

01:21.038 --> 01:22.597
We can do the transfer immediately,

01:22.598 --> 01:23.797
if you're willing to...

01:23.798 --> 01:25.037
What's your commission, one percent?

01:25.038 --> 01:28.448
- 1.75 percent.
- That's like $30,000.

01:28.473 --> 01:33.597
30,625 Euros, not including
the .25 percent handling fee.

01:33.706 --> 01:35.345
Great.

01:35.346 --> 01:37.666
- Two hours.
- An hour and a half.

01:39.066 --> 01:40.905
Fine, two hours.

01:40.906 --> 01:43.386
Call me at the same
number when you know it's ready.

01:54.994 --> 01:57.154
You think Erica's really gonna show up?

02:23.817 --> 02:26.376
Before Milo threw it off the boat,

02:26.377 --> 02:28.656
did you see what was in the package?

02:28.657 --> 02:29.937
No.

02:32.697 --> 02:34.016
Did he tell you what was in it?

02:34.017 --> 02:35.456
No.

02:35.457 --> 02:37.136
Here we see an elephant

02:37.137 --> 02:38.496
separated from its herd, seemingly unaware

02:38.497 --> 02:41.377
that predators may be lurking nearby.

02:52.803 --> 02:54.602
At some point, we'll have to assume

02:54.603 --> 02:55.723
your friends aren't coming.

02:58.083 --> 02:59.003
I hope they don't.

02:59.004 --> 03:00.202
Fuck them both.

03:00.203 --> 03:01.962
You want to die, is that it?

03:01.963 --> 03:03.242
You say it like I have a choice.

03:03.243 --> 03:05.988
They take half the money, they leave us.

03:06.044 --> 03:07.603
You don't know that. I
mean, they could be trying

03:07.604 --> 03:08.753
to call us right now. There's
no phone service here...

03:08.754 --> 03:10.097
No, I do know that. I do know...

03:10.098 --> 03:14.098
I've had a really, really shitty week.

03:16.352 --> 03:19.601
And I literally don't have
the energy to be scared, so...

03:19.805 --> 03:22.031
What did you think of the ice cream?

03:22.032 --> 03:24.431
Rose hip, roses from the garden.

03:24.432 --> 03:26.712
Great. I'm trying to eat local.

03:29.172 --> 03:31.039
You didn't have to
call your friends, you know.

03:31.812 --> 03:33.692
You could've chosen not to.

03:37.524 --> 03:38.984
Whether they come or not,

03:40.124 --> 03:41.897
you'll either kill me or you won't.

03:43.284 --> 03:45.457
Then you'll go after them or you won't.

03:46.889 --> 03:48.728
I can't control any of it.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.848
You must be curious, though.

03:50.849 --> 03:52.928
Whether they care enough to come for you.

03:52.929 --> 03:55.288
What do you think, one of them?

03:55.289 --> 03:57.448
All of them?

03:57.449 --> 03:59.089
Some of them?

04:01.036 --> 04:02.835
What happens if they don't come?

04:02.836 --> 04:04.528
I mean, what happens to you

04:04.553 --> 04:08.516
without the package and the money?

04:08.556 --> 04:09.556
Let me guess.

04:10.596 --> 04:12.184
It's out of your control.

04:53.056 --> 04:54.696
Hello.

04:54.736 --> 04:56.555
Thanks for getting back to me so quickly.

04:58.896 --> 05:00.576
Where were they seen?

05:02.176 --> 05:03.176
Bye.

05:06.432 --> 05:07.806
- Gotta go.
- No.

05:07.807 --> 05:09.360
Work.

05:09.361 --> 05:12.031
Sorry.

05:12.032 --> 05:14.752
- I love you.
- I love you.

05:35.834 --> 05:39.194
- Looks good. There you go.
- Thank you.

05:39.219 --> 05:40.658
That looks really good.

05:40.659 --> 05:42.378
Yeah. Did you see how they paid, though?

05:42.379 --> 05:44.218
That wasn't Belizean
money. That was a different color.

05:44.219 --> 05:46.619
We're closer to the
border. Maybe it's Guatemalan.

06:17.495 --> 06:19.254
Can't change that, man. Too big.

06:19.255 --> 06:20.653
You can keep the whole thing.

06:20.654 --> 06:22.653
We just want some rice and
beans and, you know, whatever else.

06:22.654 --> 06:25.613
There's no banks around
here, so we can't...

06:25.614 --> 06:27.253
We're just really hungry.

06:27.254 --> 06:28.573
Hey, you know...

06:28.574 --> 06:31.173
Me brother, him just arrived
from Belize city.

06:31.174 --> 06:32.893
Yeah, he can give to you Belizean.

06:32.894 --> 06:35.853
Yeah, then take your bill back
up to B.C., make for you change.

06:35.854 --> 06:38.121
Hey, no problem, man.

06:38.449 --> 06:40.088
Okay, well, I have someone who's...

06:40.089 --> 06:41.408
who's coming to pick us up.

06:41.409 --> 06:43.729
And, uh, she's definitely gonna have cash.

06:43.730 --> 06:44.929
She's from here, but if
not, I'll make change with him.

06:44.930 --> 06:47.570
You'll get your money either way.

06:47.610 --> 06:50.289
- Sit down, man. I'll bring it to you.
- Thank you.

06:50.290 --> 06:52.969
- That a nice guy, man. Good guy.
- Yeah.

06:52.970 --> 06:54.010
Hey, uh, you know, where you from, huh?

06:54.264 --> 06:56.356
- The U.S.?
- Chicago.

06:56.357 --> 06:58.223
Chicago? Obama.

06:58.224 --> 06:59.823
Yeah, Obama.

06:59.824 --> 07:02.662
All right, man.

07:02.663 --> 07:03.663
So we're good.

07:03.664 --> 07:05.542
Told him we got
someone coming to pick us up

07:05.543 --> 07:07.632
who has cash. He said he'll feed us.

07:07.633 --> 07:10.543
Belizean hospitality.

07:11.255 --> 07:12.614
People have been pretty nice.

07:12.615 --> 07:15.054
Really nice apart from the
ones trying to kill us.

07:15.055 --> 07:18.735
Everybody else, though, is... warm.

07:19.311 --> 07:20.494
Here you go, guys.

07:20.495 --> 07:23.600
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Appreciate that.

07:23.733 --> 07:25.415
See, he didn't have to do that.

07:27.616 --> 07:29.776
Mm, oh, yeah.

07:57.831 --> 07:59.230
You get in touch with somebody back home

07:59.231 --> 08:00.911
that can look after your dad?

08:00.912 --> 08:03.071
Yeah, it's not something just
anybody can help with.

08:03.072 --> 08:04.952
Gotta be family member or something, right?

08:06.152 --> 08:08.191
He has trouble remembering people.

08:08.192 --> 08:12.192
Not me yet, but I have no
idea how long that's gonna last.

08:15.338 --> 08:16.641
You could call your girls.

08:16.666 --> 08:18.705
I don't think I'd be
able to hold it together

08:18.706 --> 08:20.425
if I talked to them, and...

08:20.426 --> 08:23.385
it's just not the way that I...

08:23.386 --> 08:25.146
You know what I mean.

08:27.626 --> 08:29.625
Erica.

08:29.626 --> 08:31.785
Thank you so much.

08:31.786 --> 08:33.025
Where are the others?

08:33.025 --> 08:34.894
It's just us. Remember Lex?

08:34.926 --> 08:35.986
Thank you.

08:36.885 --> 08:39.775
Hey, this your friend, man?

08:39.777 --> 08:42.086
Oh, she a lovely woman.

08:42.328 --> 08:44.008
How come you no say that first thing?

08:44.009 --> 08:47.086
A lovely and she gonna pay our
bill? What better than that?

08:47.760 --> 08:51.228
- Your brothers in the car?
- Both of them. Let's go.

08:51.229 --> 08:52.747
Excuse us, please.

08:52.748 --> 08:56.391
You know, maybe it better
you leave the bag, then you go.

08:56.610 --> 08:58.628
Then no problem.

08:59.772 --> 09:01.028
Wait for us in the car, please.

09:01.029 --> 09:02.679
We'll meet you outside.

09:03.599 --> 09:04.975
Be careful.

09:11.188 --> 09:13.667
Back your asses up!

09:13.668 --> 09:15.228
Hey, hey, hey.

09:26.461 --> 09:28.181
Nine lives.

09:28.836 --> 09:31.375
These people mine!

09:31.625 --> 09:33.636
- What the hell is this?
- Out!

09:33.637 --> 09:35.476
Now!

09:35.536 --> 09:37.736
Motherfucker.

09:45.216 --> 09:46.776
Gus, come on.

09:50.976 --> 09:52.776
Drop the bags.

09:55.822 --> 09:57.683
In!

10:02.315 --> 10:04.035
In!

10:06.163 --> 10:09.123
Tie their wrists behind their back!

10:22.237 --> 10:24.317
Now you, in front.

10:47.108 --> 10:48.307
Back!

10:48.308 --> 10:50.868
- Get fucking back!
- She's getting back!

11:20.359 --> 11:21.718
Excuse me.

11:21.719 --> 11:23.719
Oh, sorry.

11:24.719 --> 11:26.847
The fruit is amazing down here.

11:26.847 --> 11:28.319
- I can't stop eating it.
- Yeah.

11:30.079 --> 11:31.919
I hear the salami is great, too.

11:32.450 --> 11:35.439
Yeah, you could take,
uh, the boy out of Chicago...

11:36.951 --> 11:38.107
I'm from San Diego.

11:38.132 --> 11:39.755
I'm not sure what that
means you take out of me.

11:39.755 --> 11:43.755
Uh... low humidity.

11:45.396 --> 11:47.035
I'm Tabatha.

11:47.036 --> 11:49.275
Oh.

11:49.276 --> 11:51.555
I'm Michael.

11:51.556 --> 11:54.337
I don't know. I've just
always wanted to see it.

11:55.156 --> 11:59.156
Yeah, you know, I think I
saw a TV special on that.

12:00.123 --> 12:03.562
I watch a ton of stuff on NatGeo,

12:03.563 --> 12:05.682
which, after a while, gotta say kind of all

12:05.683 --> 12:09.290
blends together into one big shark, temple,

12:09.782 --> 12:11.595
monkey, alien show.

12:12.723 --> 12:14.962
Well, if you do go, you will remember it.

12:14.963 --> 12:18.564
Tikal is like the Angkor
Wat of the Western Hemisphere.

12:19.424 --> 12:21.588
I know, I know.

12:21.814 --> 12:23.123
You know what, maybe I will go.

12:24.078 --> 12:25.557
I should, right?

12:25.558 --> 12:27.037
So what are you doing here, Michael?

12:27.038 --> 12:28.317
- Business.
- Hmm.

12:28.318 --> 12:31.797
A last bit of business,
um, at least for a while.

12:31.798 --> 12:33.518
I'm retiring.

12:35.678 --> 12:37.626
I, uh, sold my company

12:38.598 --> 12:42.452
and, um, just doing some,

12:42.755 --> 12:44.186
like, last banking stuff.

12:44.187 --> 12:46.354
- What's the business?
- Real estate.

12:46.355 --> 12:48.074
You're so young to be retiring.

12:48.075 --> 12:50.994
Yeah, I could be younger.

12:50.995 --> 12:52.475
I could be older, though.

12:53.073 --> 12:56.155
- Either way, it's exciting.
- Yeah, it is. It is.

12:57.475 --> 12:59.714
You know, there were
these friends that, uh, guys

12:59.715 --> 13:01.674
I knew in college, I was trying
to get them involved

13:01.675 --> 13:05.502
in some things down here, and
they wouldn't or couldn't.

13:06.143 --> 13:07.435
I took the risk,

13:08.197 --> 13:10.533
and my life is bigger because of it.

13:10.624 --> 13:11.783
There you go.

13:11.784 --> 13:13.783
Now I can do anything I want.

13:13.784 --> 13:14.984
Anything.

13:18.076 --> 13:19.614
And what does your wife want to do?

13:19.639 --> 13:22.049
- My wife?
- Um, just...

13:22.050 --> 13:23.143
Oh.

13:26.996 --> 13:28.526
She passed away

13:29.741 --> 13:32.036
two years ago, almost two years ago.

13:34.556 --> 13:36.516
I don't know why I still wear it, but...

13:36.556 --> 13:40.484
- I'm so sorry.
- Thanks. Don't be.

13:40.509 --> 13:43.796
It's just... just one of those things.

13:50.047 --> 13:51.156
Cancer.

13:52.859 --> 13:53.916
Terrible.

13:56.523 --> 13:57.636
Yeah.

14:01.883 --> 14:03.703
- But, uh...
- I should be heading out.

14:03.703 --> 14:05.417
Oh.

14:05.418 --> 14:08.403
It was nice to...

14:11.203 --> 14:13.422
Enjoy your retirement, Michael.

14:13.422 --> 14:15.043
Thank you.

14:28.258 --> 14:30.243
Would you like some news?

14:35.189 --> 14:37.349
Two of your pals are on their way.

14:39.234 --> 14:40.749
And assuming they have all the money,

14:40.750 --> 14:42.749
you might even get to go home.

14:45.398 --> 14:47.709
What is home for you? What
do we do for a living?

14:47.710 --> 14:49.530
We teach.

14:52.140 --> 14:53.600
Those who can't.

14:55.272 --> 14:57.100
Whatever made you choose to be a teacher?

14:57.140 --> 14:59.540
What made you choose to be a drug dealer?

15:02.114 --> 15:05.420
When I was 20, I backpacked around Lebanon.

15:07.807 --> 15:09.500
I met a girl from the Becca Valley.

15:09.500 --> 15:12.780
Roses grew like weeds by the roadside,

15:13.605 --> 15:14.820
and so did hashish.

15:15.815 --> 15:17.558
Beginning of a marvelous career.

15:17.668 --> 15:18.708
Took me around the world.

15:19.355 --> 15:21.027
Now you work for Jesús.

15:21.052 --> 15:24.230
No. No, no. Self-employed.

15:29.435 --> 15:30.480
And Milo?

15:31.595 --> 15:33.799
I was an investor in his company.

15:35.236 --> 15:36.835
He was a place to put your money.

15:37.556 --> 15:38.642
He was okay with that?

15:38.667 --> 15:41.595
He saw it for what it was, an opportunity.

15:42.916 --> 15:45.188
Before I left Lebanon, the
U.S. started something

15:45.189 --> 15:47.618
they called the pro-dairy intervention.

15:47.903 --> 15:49.837
They burned the hashish fields

15:50.368 --> 15:52.774
and provided local farmers with cows.

15:53.813 --> 15:55.328
Pennsylvania milking cows.

15:55.329 --> 15:57.167
So I was left with a choice.

15:57.168 --> 16:01.168
Find new suppliers,
diversify, take on more risk

16:02.910 --> 16:04.465
or export cheese.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.870
Is that supposed to impress me?

16:09.902 --> 16:11.595
Well, maybe it fucking should.

16:12.487 --> 16:14.276
Because at the end of the
day, that's the difference

16:14.276 --> 16:15.675
between you and me

16:16.309 --> 16:18.082
and for that matter, between you and Milo.

16:18.691 --> 16:19.955
You chose cheese.

16:24.340 --> 16:26.363
Lex and Gus are on their way.

16:49.271 --> 16:52.951
Erica, we're not bad people.

16:54.576 --> 16:55.576
We're not.

17:07.508 --> 17:11.108
My problem is I love the Bee Gees too much.

17:13.665 --> 17:14.588
What?

17:14.589 --> 17:16.068
How many Bee Gees dead?

17:16.924 --> 17:19.348
I'm sorry, how many Bee Gees are dead?

17:19.387 --> 17:21.387
Robin, yes. Barry?

17:21.387 --> 17:24.551
- Man, fuck your Bee Gees!
- Fuck my Bee Gees?

17:24.622 --> 17:26.748
No, no. We all love the Bee Gees.

17:26.748 --> 17:30.748
Robin is dead, yes, and Maurice, I think.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.903
There's a Maurice in the Bee Gees?

17:32.904 --> 17:34.268
Yes.

17:57.821 --> 17:59.381
What is it?

18:45.235 --> 18:46.250
Fuck.

18:47.795 --> 18:49.834
What's going on?

18:49.835 --> 18:51.634
- Him going to kill my grandmother.
- What?

18:51.635 --> 18:53.835
She came to the bar with
me. She stayed in the car.

19:12.343 --> 19:15.463
- Come on! Get off me!
- Leave him! Come on!

19:22.948 --> 19:24.348
Lex, come on!

19:27.231 --> 19:28.271
Lex!

19:42.311 --> 19:43.951
- No!
- Fuck!

19:43.991 --> 19:45.710
- No, stop the car!
- No!

19:45.711 --> 19:47.471
Stop the fucking car!

20:27.890 --> 20:29.769
...Rochelle Baer...

21:06.841 --> 21:08.800
No, no! Turn around!

21:08.801 --> 21:10.240
Are you mad? Him have a gun!

21:10.241 --> 21:12.301
- We have to, please.
- A knife is under the seat.

21:12.394 --> 21:13.753
Listen, please, we got to go back.

21:13.754 --> 21:14.902
If we go back, he will kill us.

21:14.927 --> 21:16.143
If we don't go back, he kills Lex.

21:16.168 --> 21:17.967
- Please, turn around.
- Look, we're not going back, Gus.

21:17.968 --> 21:20.455
- I'm sorry, but we're not!
- Stop the car! Let me out!

21:20.565 --> 21:23.067
- Gus.
- Stop the fucking car!

21:24.708 --> 21:27.010
I'm sorry. Thank you for your help!

21:27.628 --> 21:29.307
Thank you. I am so sorry.

21:29.308 --> 21:30.587
- I'll trade the money for Lex.
- Trade? No.

21:30.588 --> 21:31.907
He'll just kill you and take the money.

21:31.908 --> 21:33.348
- But I have to try.
- Why?

21:37.028 --> 21:39.548
No! No!

22:06.582 --> 22:08.062
Who was she?

22:08.822 --> 22:10.376
Where are they going?

22:11.534 --> 22:13.254
I don't know.

22:20.822 --> 22:23.622
I-I-I don't know.

22:28.122 --> 22:30.137
Ah, okay.

22:31.567 --> 22:34.413
- Her name is... is Erica.
- Last name?

22:34.642 --> 22:37.037
- I don't know her last name.
- Where are they going?

22:37.467 --> 22:39.326
I don't know.

22:39.351 --> 22:40.866
Where are they going?!

22:40.867 --> 22:43.466
Where are they
going?! Where are they going?!

22:43.467 --> 22:44.546
Where are they going?!

22:44.547 --> 22:47.826
- Where are they going?!
- Okay, okay, okay.

22:47.827 --> 22:49.066
I know where she lives.

22:49.067 --> 22:51.987
Okay, I'll take you there.

23:23.567 --> 23:25.486
You have one new message.

23:25.487 --> 23:26.886
Gus, this is Joel.

23:26.887 --> 23:30.206
I've been... been
kidnapped. I'm not joking.

23:30.207 --> 23:32.086
They, uh... they want the money, all of it,

23:32.087 --> 23:34.165
or they're gonna kill me.

23:34.166 --> 23:36.127
Please call me back if you get this.

23:49.324 --> 23:51.323
Come on, pound my fucking pussy!

23:51.324 --> 23:54.484
Uh-huh! Uh!

24:01.723 --> 24:03.002
Hello. Are we ready?

24:03.003 --> 24:04.483
Cobi.

24:05.322 --> 24:06.322
It's Gus.

24:08.144 --> 24:09.463
Gus?

24:09.464 --> 24:10.663
So you're okay.

24:10.664 --> 24:12.783
Good shit, man, I... I thought that...

24:15.132 --> 24:16.384
Where are you?

24:17.904 --> 24:21.183
Uh, yeah, I'm okay.

24:21.184 --> 24:22.663
Fuck!

24:22.664 --> 24:25.932
Hold on.

24:26.159 --> 24:27.598
Are you okay?

24:27.599 --> 24:29.038
Joel got kidnapped.

24:29.039 --> 24:30.073
Someone got him.

24:31.679 --> 24:32.679
Kidnapped?

24:33.199 --> 24:34.776
By who, Jesús?

24:34.823 --> 24:35.719
I don't... I don't know.

24:35.719 --> 24:37.518
I-I just picked up a message from him.

24:37.519 --> 24:39.398
He said that if we didn't return
the money, all of it,

24:39.399 --> 24:40.918
that they-they... they
were going to kill him.

24:40.919 --> 24:42.755
All the money? But we...

24:43.498 --> 24:45.039
Where the fuck did you guys go?

24:45.039 --> 24:49.039
Oh, well, Joel, uh, he
wasn't there when I got out.

24:50.800 --> 24:52.323
Uh, are you with Lex?

24:52.518 --> 24:53.612
The Cat got Lex.

24:53.651 --> 24:55.556
- The Cat?
- I got away. Lex didn't.

24:58.244 --> 24:59.744
- From the Cat?
- Yeah.

24:59.769 --> 25:00.914
How do you know it's the Cat?

25:00.939 --> 25:02.538
'Cause he's a f...

25:02.539 --> 25:05.515
Listen to me, we have to link up and deal

25:05.540 --> 25:08.656
with this shit right now or
they're going to kill him!

25:08.681 --> 25:11.781
Now, I am on a road leading from
where we were quarantined.

25:11.781 --> 25:13.359
It can't be more than, like, ten...

25:13.773 --> 25:15.297
Wait a minute, there's a mile marker.

25:17.155 --> 25:18.234
42.

25:20.977 --> 25:24.176
Cobi? Cobi, can you hear me?

25:24.177 --> 25:26.376
Yeah, yeah, I hear you.

25:26.377 --> 25:30.377
But, look, what do we know for sure?

25:30.437 --> 25:32.737
Cobi, where are you?

25:47.023 --> 25:50.335
Okay. I'm not far.

25:51.490 --> 25:52.959
I'll call you when I'm near.

25:53.591 --> 25:55.655
Just stay where you are.

26:35.193 --> 26:38.633
¿Hola? ¿Habla inglés?

26:40.593 --> 26:42.031
The woman from the embassy,

26:44.242 --> 26:45.663
the Southern coast road,

26:46.538 --> 26:50.116
uh, there's a-a ruined
house near the Guatemalan border,

26:50.483 --> 26:54.199
about one mile past the San Pedro turnoff.

26:55.161 --> 26:57.723
Uh, she...

26:59.041 --> 27:00.041
she fell.

27:03.697 --> 27:05.416
Well, the transfer has been executed.

27:05.417 --> 27:07.896
Yes, thank you. Great work.

27:07.897 --> 27:11.257
But now I need it transferred
back to me now.

27:11.670 --> 27:12.577
I see.

27:12.577 --> 27:16.577
Well, Mr. Franklin, as
a professional accountant...

27:16.764 --> 27:19.113
Financial consultant, wealth management.

27:19.160 --> 27:22.416
So you understand that
this will also require time

27:22.441 --> 27:24.886
and that we will have to
charge you the standard

27:24.887 --> 27:26.984
1.75 transfer commission.

27:26.985 --> 27:29.459
And the handling fee, .25 percent.

27:30.275 --> 27:32.642
Don't forget about
that. That's 4,200 Euros.

27:32.642 --> 27:33.870
Yes, that as well.

27:34.066 --> 27:35.417
Except I'm not gonna pay it.

27:36.542 --> 27:37.925
The fee or the commission.

27:44.251 --> 27:47.250
Why would the guy who you just completed

27:47.251 --> 27:48.730
an illegal transfer for...

27:48.731 --> 27:51.930
And by the way, you are correct,
it is highly illegal.

27:51.931 --> 27:54.370
Why is he now
threatening to report your bank

27:54.371 --> 27:56.170
and you personally

27:56.171 --> 27:58.170
to the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission,

27:58.171 --> 28:02.100
which, along with the
DEA, is investigating your bank

28:02.295 --> 28:04.068
for anonymous cash transfers?

28:04.545 --> 28:06.011
Now, the SEC, they only have jurisdiction

28:06.011 --> 28:08.330
in the United States.

28:08.331 --> 28:12.331
The DEA, they're like the fucking Marines

28:13.179 --> 28:14.611
with accountants.

28:15.374 --> 28:17.173
I'll get your money right away, no fee.

28:17.174 --> 28:21.108
I need the actual original cash, Euros,

28:21.133 --> 28:23.544
500s and the original commission.

28:23.809 --> 28:25.933
But the commission comes from the bank.

28:25.934 --> 28:27.833
That part will have to
be wired to you later.

28:27.833 --> 28:29.653
- How long?
- 24 hours.

28:29.654 --> 28:31.615
Okay.

28:32.724 --> 28:34.012
Only 'cause we're friends.

28:42.178 --> 28:44.537
Well, it shouldn't be long before

28:44.538 --> 28:46.337
at least two of your pals appear.

28:46.338 --> 28:47.338
Isn't that touching?

28:48.086 --> 28:50.419
Yeah, lucky me.

28:50.419 --> 28:54.099
- Oh, so you believe in luck.
- Luck is chance.

28:55.687 --> 28:57.000
Chance is math.

28:58.099 --> 28:59.378
I believe in math.

28:59.379 --> 29:00.898
Don't tell me you're a maths teacher.

29:00.899 --> 29:03.219
I teach teachers.

29:03.439 --> 29:04.961
I teach teaching methods.

29:06.828 --> 29:07.828
Christ.

29:09.203 --> 29:11.012
What did Milo see in you?

29:11.037 --> 29:13.137
At least he tried to
grab life by the balls.

29:13.162 --> 29:15.259
I guess a shared
history counts for something.

29:16.656 --> 29:17.975
We went back a long way.

29:17.976 --> 29:19.850
Enough to get you mixed up in all this.

29:20.804 --> 29:23.056
Enough to leave me his villa.

29:26.975 --> 29:27.975
What?

29:28.495 --> 29:30.374
Well, just a quarter share.

29:30.375 --> 29:31.843
I don't think so.

29:31.843 --> 29:33.031
He showed us his will.

29:33.495 --> 29:35.454
That villa's not his to leave anyone.

29:35.455 --> 29:36.934
It's mine.

29:36.935 --> 29:40.615
Well, I saw the title deed,

29:42.123 --> 29:45.094
so I'd have to say

29:45.095 --> 29:46.584
not anymore.

29:48.615 --> 29:51.226
Then I guess if you
work in high-end real estate

29:51.251 --> 29:52.374
in Belize and you're the type of person

29:52.375 --> 29:54.758
who grabs opportunities by the balls,

29:55.601 --> 29:57.375
you'd know how to do that kind of thing.

29:58.655 --> 30:02.655
If that's true, none of you are going home.

30:18.743 --> 30:19.902
I'm sorry.

30:19.903 --> 30:21.582
It was nighttime when we were here.

30:21.583 --> 30:22.822
All these streets look alike.

30:22.823 --> 30:24.142
She lived down a small street?

30:24.143 --> 30:25.983
An alley, yeah.

30:26.516 --> 30:28.422
This neighborhood is filthy.

30:28.423 --> 30:30.661
These people are dogs.

30:31.411 --> 30:33.559
It's harder to kill a dog than a person.

30:33.591 --> 30:35.700
But these people are dogs.

30:37.411 --> 30:39.250
Look!

30:39.251 --> 30:40.624
Where is it?

30:41.811 --> 30:43.218
Keep looking.

31:01.841 --> 31:03.131
Maybe a different street.

31:08.267 --> 31:09.548
What do you want me to say, huh?

31:10.111 --> 31:11.548
You said you know where she lived.

31:11.549 --> 31:14.147
I was here once, and it was nighttime.

31:14.148 --> 31:15.148
It was dark.

31:20.748 --> 31:22.428
This isn't the street.

31:27.578 --> 31:29.515
Then we need to be straight

31:30.929 --> 31:32.890
on what we say

31:34.625 --> 31:36.204
or we both die.

31:48.631 --> 31:50.466
There was just him when I got there.

31:52.189 --> 31:53.189
In.

32:00.174 --> 32:01.126
And the money?

32:01.127 --> 32:03.344
- He says it's with the others.
- The other two?

32:03.345 --> 32:05.654
Yeah, we split the money between us.

32:05.654 --> 32:06.922
So where's your share?

32:06.947 --> 32:08.588
My friend took it.

32:09.854 --> 32:11.447
I gave it to him. I didn't want it.

32:11.472 --> 32:13.414
Another honest man, who'd have believed it?

32:13.414 --> 32:14.804
The black one has it.

32:16.351 --> 32:18.974
He's probably out of Belize by now.

32:18.974 --> 32:20.991
That's what we were all trying to do.

32:22.374 --> 32:24.053
That's all he knows.

32:24.054 --> 32:25.371
And the fourth?

32:25.723 --> 32:27.694
- Cobi?
- I don't know where he is.

32:28.528 --> 32:29.734
So two of them

32:30.481 --> 32:32.749
with three quarters of the
money are still missing.

32:33.788 --> 32:34.788
Yeah.

32:35.374 --> 32:38.241
Why wouldn't you lot have just
stuck to-fucking-gether?

32:40.342 --> 32:41.663
Lots of reasons.

32:50.178 --> 32:51.178
Lex.

32:58.538 --> 32:59.772
Jesus Christ.

33:01.124 --> 33:02.319
Are you all right?

33:02.928 --> 33:04.159
Could be worse.

33:05.684 --> 33:06.705
You?

33:07.791 --> 33:08.838
You know...

33:09.235 --> 33:10.401
Gus and Cobi?

33:11.284 --> 33:12.403
Gus got away.

33:12.404 --> 33:16.084
Uh, no clue about Cobi.

33:17.084 --> 33:20.804
Did you, uh, did you
wait for us when you got out?

33:23.090 --> 33:24.090
No.

33:40.668 --> 33:43.543
Where are we? Who is this guy?

33:44.004 --> 33:45.160
He's a drug dealer.

33:45.473 --> 33:47.473
Says he doesn't work for Jesús

33:48.650 --> 33:50.850
and that Milo was laundering money for him.

33:59.023 --> 34:00.124
So what now?

34:01.383 --> 34:05.063
If he offers you ice cream, take it.

34:40.112 --> 34:42.415
- Where's your money?
- It's gone.

34:42.440 --> 34:43.518
But you got yours.

34:43.520 --> 34:45.359
Gone? Yeah, I got mine.

34:45.360 --> 34:46.998
What do you mean,
gone? You mean Lex has it?

34:47.000 --> 34:48.599
It got stolen.

34:48.600 --> 34:51.639
So your money and his
money are not with you or him?

34:51.639 --> 34:52.759
The Cat came back.

34:52.760 --> 34:54.759
I am lucky that I even got away.

34:54.760 --> 34:56.559
Okay, where did you go?

34:56.560 --> 34:59.607
Gus, we need that
money to get Lex and Joel.

34:59.747 --> 35:00.920
That's what you said, right, isn't it?

35:00.920 --> 35:03.160
That if we don't bring the
money, all the money,

35:03.161 --> 35:04.801
they're gonna... they're gonna kill them.

35:04.982 --> 35:06.141
Isn't that what you said? Right?

35:06.142 --> 35:07.741
And so now we only have half the money

35:07.742 --> 35:09.061
and you didn't even
think about telling me this?

35:09.062 --> 35:10.075
Where did you go?

35:10.100 --> 35:12.821
I'm here now with the only money we have.

35:13.008 --> 35:15.207
Are you gonna answer my
fucking question or not?

35:15.208 --> 35:16.688
- Fuck!
- Hey!

35:21.352 --> 35:25.032
We have to figure this
out. We have to, right?

35:25.192 --> 35:26.589
Uh-huh.

35:32.552 --> 35:34.573
Do you know where the money is,

35:35.885 --> 35:37.912
and is it possible to get it back

35:37.913 --> 35:41.391
before we have to go to Plan B?

35:41.392 --> 35:42.752
What is Plan B?

35:42.752 --> 35:44.712
I have no fucking clue.

35:54.990 --> 35:55.992
This is good.

35:58.053 --> 35:59.053
Rose hip.

36:05.977 --> 36:07.157
What's a rose hip?

36:38.555 --> 36:41.619
Assuming they got Joel with
his share plus your quarter,

36:41.620 --> 36:42.861
we're only short half the money.

36:42.862 --> 36:44.794
Only short half.

36:44.795 --> 36:48.274
Dude, we can't show up
there with only half.

36:48.275 --> 36:50.035
Then what are we supposed to do?

36:51.235 --> 36:54.675
If we go there without all of the money,

36:55.436 --> 36:57.039
all of us are going to be killed.

36:58.750 --> 36:59.955
All of us.

37:00.500 --> 37:02.035
We have to run.

37:04.555 --> 37:05.750
Fuck.

37:05.775 --> 37:07.797
What I'm saying sucks.

37:08.957 --> 37:10.276
I know.

37:10.277 --> 37:12.036
But I'm right about this.

37:12.037 --> 37:13.116
Man, you're a fucking joke.

37:13.117 --> 37:14.596
I am not a joke!

37:14.597 --> 37:17.636
You're a fucking joke! You
better hope we die, man.

37:17.637 --> 37:18.637
Come on.

37:18.638 --> 37:20.626
It's gonna be real awkward,

37:20.868 --> 37:22.997
uncomfortable seeing you around back home.

37:31.055 --> 37:33.516
Do what you want. Be who you are, Cobi.

37:58.001 --> 38:01.281
Here, here. Thank you. Appreciate it.

38:06.908 --> 38:10.285
Um, would you mind waiting
for a few minutes?

38:11.708 --> 38:12.910
Thanks, asshole.

38:48.419 --> 38:51.855
That is not all the money.

38:51.856 --> 38:53.378
- The embassy has it.
- Listen, we-we...

38:53.379 --> 38:56.098
We gave the rest to a woman at the embassy.

38:56.099 --> 38:57.738
- The U.S. embassy?
- Yeah.

38:57.739 --> 38:59.298
- What's her name?
- Rochelle.

38:59.299 --> 39:00.778
Rochelle. Last name.

39:00.934 --> 39:03.629
Baer. Rochelle Baer.

39:05.028 --> 39:08.299
If she doesn't hear from
us at the top of the hour,

39:08.299 --> 39:11.979
she's gonna come looking for
us and you, here, armed.

39:12.843 --> 39:13.843
Ooh.

39:15.014 --> 39:16.798
We only reported half of the money

39:17.044 --> 39:19.619
because we were gonna
keep the other half ourselves.

39:19.927 --> 39:21.169
Good for you.

39:22.185 --> 39:23.607
So how about this?

39:24.638 --> 39:27.068
Go ahead and keep
that and let all of us go.

39:27.068 --> 39:30.469
We'll tell her that Joel and
Lex found us before we found them.

39:30.649 --> 39:32.488
And they'll say that Jesús did it.

39:32.489 --> 39:35.248
You'll have half the money,
no problems with the embassy.

39:35.249 --> 39:36.892
And you get to stay alive.

39:38.345 --> 39:39.969
That okay with you, Joel?

39:41.489 --> 39:43.649
Hey, come here.

39:45.501 --> 39:46.780
See this pond?

39:46.781 --> 39:48.660
Where do you think the fish come from?

39:48.661 --> 39:51.228
- Hmm?
- Me, neither.

40:08.259 --> 40:10.767
We'll get you the money.

40:10.768 --> 40:12.648
It was an accident.

40:15.089 --> 40:17.409
It was a mistake!

40:21.169 --> 40:22.383
Cobi.

40:22.408 --> 40:25.329
Where's the rest of the money?

40:27.129 --> 40:28.848
Shoot one of them.
