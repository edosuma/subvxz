00:17.000 --> 00:18.448
No. Not really.

00:18.517 --> 00:20.586

Quinn was a bad business

- So I've done some
research.

01:56.482 --> 01:58.000
The Jacobs Group
is old-school.

01:58.068 --> 01:59.862
They made their money
in specialty metals

01:59.931 --> 02:02.551
and they've never invested
in this kind of space before.

02:02.620 --> 02:05.034
- Well, I'm hoping that means
they'll be hands off.

02:05.103 --> 02:07.413
And after Quinn and Bryce,
that's what we need.

02:07.482 --> 02:09.275
You can run this company.
You don't need

02:09.344 --> 02:11.068

pushing their agenda.

Hey, what's up?

you both a safe flight

02:21.206 --> 02:22.827
and say good luck.

02:22.896 --> 02:24.655
- Aw. Thank you.
- Also...

02:24.724 --> 02:27.275
have you seen
the Infinitely 21 ad?

02:27.344 --> 02:28.758
- No. How does it look?

02:28.827 --> 02:31.379
- Like a 20-foot tall photo
of me and Josh,

02:31.448 --> 02:34.172
and it looks sort of, um,
intimate?

02:34.241 --> 02:35.586
- Wait--what?

02:35.655 --> 02:37.000
I thought
the campaign was just you.

02:37.068 --> 02:38.448
- Yeah, well, I guess
that wasn't enough

02:38.517 --> 02:40.034
to sell a bodysuit.

02:40.103 --> 02:42.448
Look, I wanna be the one
to show it to Charles.

02:42.517 --> 02:44.034
Do you think you could
keep him from seeing it

02:44.103 --> 02:45.827
over the next couple of days?

02:45.896 --> 02:47.620
- Come on.
I doubt it's that bad.

02:47.689 --> 02:49.034
Why don't you reach out
to Lauren

02:49.103 --> 02:52.034
and see if she can contact
the company and--

02:52.103 --> 02:53.586
Wow.

02:53.655 --> 02:56.620
Uh...I'll see what I can do.

02:56.689 --> 02:58.655
- Hey, Kelsey--
- Hey, I hate escalators.

02:58.724 --> 03:01.482
Uh, they're...weird,
and I don't like 'em.

03:01.551 --> 03:03.758
Can we take the elevator?

03:03.827 --> 03:05.310
It's right--
- Uh, yeah.

03:05.379 --> 03:07.793
Uh...sure.

03:12.448 --> 03:14.344
- So...I've got news.

03:14.413 --> 03:16.724
- Hit me.
- Google is offering me

03:16.793 --> 03:18.689
a senior project
manager position.

03:18.758 --> 03:20.379
- Hey, that's fantastic!

03:20.448 --> 03:23.448
- Which means Gemma would get
top priority for daycare.

03:23.517 --> 03:25.344
- Awesome! Yeah, we were
hoping she'd get in.

03:25.413 --> 03:27.551
You're gonna be
so smart, baby girl.

03:27.620 --> 03:28.965
You're gonna go
to Google daycare

03:29.034 --> 03:31.000
and then just skip
straight to college.

03:31.068 --> 03:32.827
- By the time she's ready
for college,

03:32.896 --> 03:34.482
it's gonna be so expensive.

03:34.551 --> 03:36.827
- Hey--or free.
- Look, I-I just mean

03:36.896 --> 03:38.551
that we don't know what
the future holds.

03:38.620 --> 03:40.551
- Yeah...
- Which is a great reason

03:40.620 --> 03:41.896
for me to take this
promotion.

03:41.965 --> 03:44.551
It's a lot more money,
Josh.

03:44.620 --> 03:46.517
- Hey, you don't have to
sell me.

03:46.586 --> 03:50.103
- It's also...
in Los Angeles.

03:50.172 --> 03:51.586
- Wait--what?

03:51.655 --> 03:53.758
- Look, I don't want to
separate you from Gemma,

03:53.827 --> 03:56.724
but...I'm trying to think
of the big picture.

03:56.793 --> 03:59.793
This will give us
a lot of security

03:59.862 --> 04:03.241
and when she's not in school,
she can spend summers with you.

04:03.310 --> 04:04.862
- And what about until then?

04:04.931 --> 04:06.586
She's just gonna
stay with you...

04:06.655 --> 04:08.586
in California?

04:08.655 --> 04:10.275
Come on, Clare,
that's crazy!

04:10.344 --> 04:13.586
- Josh, last year
I was working in a bar.

04:13.655 --> 04:15.827
I don't have any savings.

04:15.896 --> 04:18.586
We're both just trying
to do the best we can for her,

04:18.655 --> 04:20.344
and this is the best.

04:20.413 --> 04:22.689
- I can't believe this.

04:22.758 --> 04:24.482
- I have to get back.

04:24.551 --> 04:26.172
Look, we'll figure it out,
all right?

04:26.241 --> 04:28.172
I promise.

04:32.689 --> 04:35.896
- Hey, man,
is that you?

04:38.551 --> 04:40.620
- Holy shit!

04:46.586 --> 04:47.965
- Lauren, you're here.
- Uh, yeah.

04:48.034 --> 04:49.896
Diva's got
a dress fitting at Kleinfeld's.

04:49.965 --> 04:51.172
I pulled a few strings--
no big deal.

04:51.241 --> 04:52.689
Except it's a pretty big deal.

04:52.758 --> 04:54.103
- You're coming too.
There's nothing to do here

04:54.172 --> 04:55.896
except wait and see
if the people we sent

04:55.965 --> 04:57.724
to catch our food return.
- Lauren, can I talk to you

04:57.793 --> 04:59.379
for a sec?
- Here?

04:59.448 --> 05:02.827
- I saw the billboard.
- So here. Okay.

05:02.896 --> 05:05.413
- Why is Josh in the ad,
and why wasn't I told?

05:05.482 --> 05:07.586
- It was a hot set!
I mean, anyone in that bar

05:07.655 --> 05:09.931
was fair game!
- Anyone else in that bar

05:10.000 --> 05:12.137
would be fine,
but Josh is--

05:12.206 --> 05:13.275
- The ex?
Let me see.

05:13.344 --> 05:15.000
- You do not--

05:16.379 --> 05:17.793
- Oh...
- It's not "oh."

05:17.862 --> 05:19.793
There's no "oh."
- You look happy.

05:19.862 --> 05:21.551
- I'm normally happy,
so I look normal.

05:21.620 --> 05:24.034
- Okay, look, how 'bout this?
Just don't think of it as Josh.

05:24.103 --> 05:26.586
It's just a hot guy
and a hot girl/woman

05:26.655 --> 05:28.275
who look like
they're into each other.

05:28.344 --> 05:30.206
No one knows that's your ex.
- Well, her current lover...

05:30.275 --> 05:32.655
"knows."

05:32.724 --> 05:34.413
This emoji!

05:34.482 --> 05:37.137
I-I don't know what to say!
They're not gonna pull it.

05:37.206 --> 05:39.137
I guess the only silver lining
is that it's regional,

05:39.206 --> 05:40.827
so with Kelsey and your boo
in Chicago,

05:40.896 --> 05:42.103
it's tomorrow's problem.

05:42.172 --> 05:44.137
- I guess that buys me
some time.

05:44.206 --> 05:45.862
- Yeah, how much time
do you need to say,

05:45.931 --> 05:48.448
"Sorry, Charles, my ex
is a big, fat snack?"

05:48.517 --> 05:50.103
- Oh, God.

05:50.172 --> 05:53.655
- I'm sorry--How did this
become about you?

05:56.482 --> 05:58.793
- So none of the other hundreds
of photos that were taken

05:58.862 --> 06:00.931
were good enough
for the campaign?

06:01.000 --> 06:02.517
The scooter?
People were really smiling

06:02.586 --> 06:04.827
when I was on that scooter.
- They were holding in

06:04.896 --> 06:06.310
a laugh, Liza.
I am sorry, listen...

06:06.379 --> 06:08.551
I called Shelly from
Infinitely 21 and I asked her

06:08.620 --> 06:11.137
to swap out the photos.
I told her that you felt misled

06:11.206 --> 06:12.896
and that you were uncomfortable
with the final image.

06:12.965 --> 06:14.896
- And?
- This was all in a voicemail.

06:14.965 --> 06:16.689
I left a voicemail
for you!

06:16.758 --> 06:18.689
- Zipper?
- Yes.

06:23.689 --> 06:26.379
- You look pretty.
- Eh. I think we can do better.

06:26.448 --> 06:29.310
No, I saw a mandarin collar
jumpsuit in off-white

06:29.379 --> 06:31.965
that was giving me
bedroom eyes--I'll B-R-B.

06:32.034 --> 06:33.241
- Off-white.

06:33.310 --> 06:35.586
Sounds like there's
something wrong with it.

06:35.655 --> 06:37.172
- I wore off-white
to my wedding.

06:37.241 --> 06:39.310
I was ten weeks pregnant
with Caitlin at the time,

06:39.379 --> 06:41.482
so those were the rules.
- You saw my wedding dress.

06:41.551 --> 06:44.034
It was all taffeta--It was like
wearing a bale of hay.

06:44.103 --> 06:45.827
I was itching all day
and night.

06:45.896 --> 06:47.137
By the time I got home,
I had welts everywhere

06:47.206 --> 06:49.758
and Andy wouldn't
go near me.

06:49.827 --> 06:52.344
Probably other reasons
for that, looking back.

06:52.413 --> 06:53.862
- Well, I don't know
about you,

06:53.931 --> 06:55.827
but I didn't know
what I wanted in my 20s.

06:55.896 --> 06:58.413
- Oh, you mean
two weeks ago?

06:58.482 --> 06:59.827
It does seem
a little backwards,

06:59.896 --> 07:01.793
all the pomp and circumstance
and...fabric

07:01.862 --> 07:03.758
for the ones
that didn't work out.

07:03.827 --> 07:05.689
- Yeah. Seems like
the bigger celebration

07:05.758 --> 07:08.689
should be for when
you finally get it right.

07:08.758 --> 07:11.931
- You know what?

07:12.000 --> 07:13.655
I agree.

07:15.862 --> 07:18.172
- Okay, um...bad news.

07:18.241 --> 07:19.896
The mandarin collar
had a lettuce hem.

07:19.965 --> 07:21.448
Diana Trout is not
walking down the aisle

07:21.517 --> 07:23.000
looking like a spring roll.

07:23.068 --> 07:25.068
Also, Shelly Rozanzky from
Infinitely 21 called.

07:25.137 --> 07:26.482
- Oh, good!

07:26.551 --> 07:28.172
- Mm, did you not hear
when I just said bad news?

07:28.241 --> 07:30.896
No, the campaign is doing
so well that it's...

07:30.965 --> 07:32.827
it's--it's going national.

07:32.896 --> 07:35.310
Liza, I am so sorry.
- What? When?

07:35.379 --> 07:37.379
- It's digital.
You just press a button,

07:37.448 --> 07:39.344
so, like...now?

07:39.413 --> 07:40.586
- If you two will excuse me.

07:40.655 --> 07:42.379
- Where're you going?

07:42.448 --> 07:44.413
-  Chicago.

07:57.379 --> 07:59.413
- I'm just trying to think
of this as practice.

07:59.482 --> 08:01.068
You know,
it's our first pitch.

08:01.137 --> 08:03.068
If it doesn't go well,
learn and move on.

08:03.137 --> 08:05.172
- Uh, this is our only pitch.

08:05.241 --> 08:07.137
- What? You said we had
a long list of investors

08:07.206 --> 08:08.344
to meet with.

08:08.413 --> 08:09.965
- And when I went through
that list,

08:10.034 --> 08:12.137
I realized we have hit up
every single one

08:12.206 --> 08:13.862
except Jacobs.

08:15.517 --> 08:18.620
- So this is our only shot
at keeping the company alive?

08:18.689 --> 08:20.413
- Sorry.

08:20.482 --> 08:22.344
- I'm sorry.

08:23.137 --> 08:26.241
- Kelsey, Charles.
Jeffrey Jacobs.

08:26.310 --> 08:28.172
This is my dad Ennis.
- Hi!

08:28.241 --> 08:29.931
- Glad you
could make the trip.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.379
- Hi, Ennis.
- We're excited to be here.

08:32.448 --> 08:35.655
- We made our money
in specialty metals,

08:35.724 --> 08:37.379
immutable alloys.

08:37.448 --> 08:39.724
Ha. Do you even know
what those are?

08:39.793 --> 08:43.034
- Uh, we have both done
our research.

08:43.103 --> 08:44.931
- What I mean is, uh,

08:45.000 --> 08:47.034
we're not accustomed
to the kind of change

08:47.103 --> 08:49.517
you have to deal with
in the publishing industry.

08:49.586 --> 08:50.965
- As potential investors,

08:51.034 --> 08:54.000
how can you put our minds
at ease?

08:54.068 --> 08:55.965
- Well, this company's been
around for six decades.

08:56.034 --> 08:59.655
We've always been competitive
with the larger houses.

08:59.724 --> 09:04.172
We've even managed to lure away
some of their heavy hitters.

09:04.241 --> 09:05.517
- And how have you done that?

09:05.586 --> 09:07.103
- Uh, we have done that

09:07.172 --> 09:09.275
by having an appetite
for hard work

09:09.344 --> 09:12.896
and by believing that what we
do is for the greater good.

09:12.965 --> 09:15.068
- And we participate
in the change.

09:15.137 --> 09:17.965
We're not the same company
that we were six decades ago

09:18.034 --> 09:19.862
or even six months ago.

09:19.931 --> 09:22.103
When I became publisher,

09:22.172 --> 09:23.931
I immediately hired
a social media strategist

09:24.000 --> 09:25.827
because that's really
the only way

09:25.896 --> 09:28.586
to stay ahead of the curve now.
- Everyone says social media,

09:28.655 --> 09:32.034
but how does that actually
translate to better business?

09:32.103 --> 09:35.517
- People expect access
and transparency.

09:35.586 --> 09:39.517
I post book lists and stories
to my Insta every day.

09:39.586 --> 09:42.103
All of you can find me at
@MillennialKelsey, by the way.

09:42.172 --> 09:46.034
Accessibility and transparency
build trust,

09:46.103 --> 09:48.620
which means as a company,
we'll have more success

09:48.689 --> 09:50.172
launching new authors,

09:50.241 --> 09:52.241
and that's how it translates
to better business.

09:52.310 --> 09:54.034
So...

09:54.103 --> 09:56.931
in the spirit of
transparency...

09:57.000 --> 09:59.241
we need your money.

10:08.620 --> 10:10.620
- Hey.
- What's going on?

10:10.689 --> 10:12.103
- Do you have any weed?

10:12.172 --> 10:14.862
- Yeah, but could have
texted me that.

10:14.931 --> 10:18.137
-Uh, Clare is taking
a new job in L.A.

10:18.206 --> 10:19.724
- What?
- Yeah.

10:19.793 --> 10:22.655
It's a big new promotion
which means a lot more money,

10:22.724 --> 10:25.413
which is great--
I mean, we need it,

10:25.482 --> 10:28.172
and obviously, I wanna do
what's best for Gemma.

10:28.241 --> 10:29.965
- So hire a lawyer, okay,
Josh,

10:30.034 --> 10:32.000
and fight to keep her here.

10:32.068 --> 10:33.931
- No, no, no,
I don't want to get into

10:34.000 --> 10:35.413
a big legal battle.
over custody.

10:35.482 --> 10:37.862
- Well, no one does,
but sometimes you have to.

10:37.931 --> 10:39.448
-  I mean,
you know me, right?

10:39.517 --> 10:42.137
You know that I fight
to keep people in my life.

10:42.206 --> 10:44.620
I just don't know if it's
the best thing to do anymore.

10:44.689 --> 10:47.379
- What are you talking about?
- There's all these ads

10:47.448 --> 10:49.379
all over the city
of me and Liza,

10:49.448 --> 10:52.896
reminding me that no matter
how much you love someone,

10:52.965 --> 10:55.482
it doesn't mean
they stick around.

10:55.551 --> 10:57.241
It doesn't mean

10:57.310 --> 10:59.206
that you're what's best
for them.

10:59.275 --> 11:01.827
I don't know.
I think it's a sign.

11:01.896 --> 11:03.448
- No. It's not a sign.

11:03.517 --> 11:06.172
- Uh, it's literally
a sign, Maggie.

11:06.241 --> 11:07.965
It's in Chelsea,
it's in Midtown,

11:08.034 --> 11:09.517
it's on a deli in Gowanus.

11:09.586 --> 11:11.586
I mean, they're everywhere!
- Okay, okay, okay.

11:11.655 --> 11:13.448
All right, look...

11:13.517 --> 11:15.896
maybe...maybe you take
this new publicity

11:15.965 --> 11:18.344
as a business opportunity.

11:18.413 --> 11:20.413
Maybe--just sayin'--

11:20.482 --> 11:23.310
it's a sign that you could
make more money

11:23.379 --> 11:26.620
so that Clare doesn't have
to take that new promotion.

11:26.689 --> 11:28.000
- Okay. How?

11:28.068 --> 11:30.448
- I don't know,
but Infinitely 21

11:30.517 --> 11:32.172
is making bank off of you.

11:32.241 --> 11:34.137
Why not make bank
off of them?

11:34.206 --> 11:36.379
- Mm, eh...kinda seems
like a reach, Mags,

11:36.448 --> 11:37.827
don't ya think?

11:37.896 --> 11:39.655
- Well, if I were you...

11:39.724 --> 11:41.344
- I'd start reaching.

11:45.379 --> 11:50.068
- Okay, just to--
to triple, triple check,

11:50.137 --> 11:52.482
"We would love to be
in business with Millennial"

11:52.551 --> 11:54.172
means we got it, right?

11:54.241 --> 11:55.482
- We definitely got it.

11:55.551 --> 11:57.724
- Whew!
- I know that was hard.

11:57.793 --> 12:01.931
But you did such
an amazingjob, Kelsey.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.034
You have my gratitude
forever.

12:05.103 --> 12:06.896
- This company means
a lot to me too.

12:06.965 --> 12:08.689
- Hmm.

12:08.758 --> 12:10.137
- Let's commemorate this.

12:10.206 --> 12:12.137
Come on, the obligatory
glass-clinking post.

12:12.206 --> 12:13.758
- Ah.
- Just cheesy enough

12:13.827 --> 12:15.172
to make people forgive you

12:15.241 --> 12:16.758
for rubbing your success
right in their face.

12:16.827 --> 12:17.965
Ready?
- Yeah.

12:18.034 --> 12:19.482
- Go!
- Go.

12:19.551 --> 12:20.862
Cheers. To you.

12:20.931 --> 12:23.172
- Hi! So the meeting
went well?

12:24.827 --> 12:26.344
- Liza!
- Hi.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.034
- What are you doing
here?

12:28.103 --> 12:30.551
- I didn't have plans
for the weekend, so...

12:30.620 --> 12:32.586
- Hi! I, uh...

12:32.655 --> 12:35.206
God, this day just keeps
getting better and better.

12:35.275 --> 12:37.931
- Aw.
- You can celebrate with us.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.413
- 'Cause we got the money!

12:39.482 --> 12:41.000
- Oh, my gosh!

12:41.068 --> 12:43.241
- She was un...believable.

12:43.310 --> 12:45.655
Let me get you a drink.
- Okay.

12:45.724 --> 12:47.586
I am so proud of you!

12:47.655 --> 12:49.275
- Thank you.

12:49.344 --> 12:51.482
I was kind of amazing.
- Tell me everything.

12:51.551 --> 12:54.379
- I will, but first tell me
why you're really here.

12:56.413 --> 12:58.862
- The Infinitely 21 campaign
is going national.

12:58.931 --> 13:01.000
And so I just wanted
to talk to Charles

13:01.068 --> 13:02.206
before he sees it.

13:02.275 --> 13:04.482
- Liza...
- What?

13:04.551 --> 13:07.620
- Not now--come on!
The company's back in black,

13:07.689 --> 13:09.206
and we are celebrating.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.172
- You're right.
I'll wait.

13:20.551 --> 13:23.758
- What? You made out
with Chrissie hart?

13:23.827 --> 13:25.172
- Yeah. It was a really

13:25.241 --> 13:27.758
"Don't meet your heroes"
kind of moment.

13:27.827 --> 13:30.241
- I'm so sorry.
- Are you?

13:30.310 --> 13:32.448
- Actually, no,
but I'm a little jealous.

13:38.413 --> 13:41.586
- Okeydokey. All right.
I'm gonna go to my room.

13:41.655 --> 13:44.310
Don't keep him out too late,

13:44.379 --> 13:45.793
'cause deal isn't signed yet.

13:45.862 --> 13:47.586
- Night-night.
- Good night.

13:47.655 --> 13:48.655
Bye.

No, No.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.413
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

15:00.482 --> 15:02.000
Aah!

15:07.034 --> 15:09.103
- Good morning.

15:09.172 --> 15:11.241
- Good morning.

15:11.310 --> 15:12.655
- Mm.

15:14.068 --> 15:15.620
- Mm. This is my fantasy--

15:15.689 --> 15:18.931
you, me, coffee, paper.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.551
- Mm.

15:25.931 --> 15:27.517
- Mm. You are right.

15:27.586 --> 15:30.344
What am I doing reading
the paper when you're here?

15:30.413 --> 15:32.448
- Ha.

15:32.517 --> 15:36.310
The, um, the Infinitely 21 ad
is out.

15:36.379 --> 15:38.655
It's out everywhere.
It's in the paper

15:38.724 --> 15:40.517
that you were reading
which is now in my hand.

15:40.586 --> 15:42.068
- Well, let me see it.
- No, no, um...

15:42.137 --> 15:43.482
- Can't be that
embarrassing.

15:43.551 --> 15:44.965
- It's just not
what I expected.

15:45.034 --> 15:47.172
There were a lot of
photos taken,

15:47.241 --> 15:49.241
mostly just of me, but...

15:49.310 --> 15:51.689
sometimes there were other
people in the shots as well.

15:51.758 --> 15:53.206
You were in some of them.

15:53.275 --> 15:56.172
- Am I in the photo?
- No, um...

15:57.862 --> 16:00.344
Josh is.

16:02.655 --> 16:04.448
- Oh.
- They liked that he was

16:04.517 --> 16:08.896
sort of the inspiration
behind me passing for 26, so...

16:16.551 --> 16:18.620
He saw it.
- Charles saw my boobs?

16:18.689 --> 16:21.000
- What? No, no,
the Infinitely 21 ad.

16:21.068 --> 16:23.482
Liza!

16:23.551 --> 16:26.482
Hey, we might have
a big problem.

16:26.551 --> 16:28.551
- What is going on?
- A private video

16:28.620 --> 16:30.344
that I meant to DM to Zane...

16:30.413 --> 16:33.655
I accidently posted
to my story.

16:33.724 --> 16:35.413
- What does that mean?
- It means

16:35.482 --> 16:38.275
everyone that follows Kelsey
potentially saw her...

16:38.344 --> 16:41.275
message.
- That includes, like,

16:41.344 --> 16:43.413
editors of "The New York Times"
and authors

16:43.482 --> 16:44.793
and all of those investors

16:44.862 --> 16:48.034
that I convinced
to follow me yesterday!

16:48.103 --> 16:49.448
Look, I have deleted it,

16:49.517 --> 16:51.551
but it comes up
when you Google my name.

16:51.620 --> 16:53.827
Or Millennial.
Or publisher.

16:53.896 --> 16:55.862
Or..."Guess Who?"

16:55.931 --> 16:57.275
- "Guess Who"?

16:57.344 --> 17:00.620
- Guess who got
the money, honey?

17:00.689 --> 17:02.034
- Oh...I see.

17:02.103 --> 17:04.206
Well, you look good.
- I'm a meme!

17:04.275 --> 17:06.620
What if this affects
the deal?

17:06.689 --> 17:08.206
- I don't know.

17:08.275 --> 17:09.862
I mean, I have to think
if it was going to,

17:09.931 --> 17:11.724
they would have canceled
the meeting already.

17:11.793 --> 17:14.793
- I hope you're right.
- The only thing that we can do

17:14.862 --> 17:17.758
go down there
and sign those papers.

17:32.827 --> 17:34.931
- Thanks for meeting me.
I really appreciate it.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.482
- My pleasure, honestly.

17:36.551 --> 17:38.586
I mean, I don't have
a ton of time, but...

17:38.655 --> 17:40.482
- However much you need.

17:40.551 --> 17:42.310
- I, uh, hear that
the campaign's

17:42.379 --> 17:44.448
doing really great
for you guys.

17:44.517 --> 17:46.379
- Oh, I think we've really
tapped into something

17:46.448 --> 17:48.206
with this ad.
- Nice!

17:48.275 --> 17:50.620
Well, I would like to
keep on tapping.

17:50.689 --> 17:52.000
- Ha ha ha ha.

17:52.068 --> 17:53.965
Okay.
- So, I've been wanting

17:54.034 --> 17:56.586
to franchise Inkburg
for a while now,

17:56.655 --> 17:58.379
and I've done a ton
of research

17:58.448 --> 18:00.103
and I've found that

18:00.172 --> 18:02.517
people associate
more strongly with a brand

18:02.586 --> 18:06.000
when they can link it
to a fun experience.

18:06.068 --> 18:07.931
- Retail-tainment.
I'm...familiar.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.931
- Great. So...

18:10.000 --> 18:12.931
what do you think about
partnering with me

18:13.000 --> 18:16.551
to bring your customers
the experience

18:16.620 --> 18:18.551
of getting a tattoo
right here in the shop?

18:18.620 --> 18:20.482
- Hmm.
- This is obviously

18:20.551 --> 18:22.586
what it could look like--
I've done some exteriors,

18:22.655 --> 18:24.793
and then inside, I would
just operate one chair,

18:24.862 --> 18:27.344
so I wouldn't need a ton
of space or anything.

18:27.413 --> 18:29.965
- In the storefront window?
Okay...

18:30.034 --> 18:31.620
- Rivington Tattoo
just did it at Saks,

18:31.689 --> 18:33.034
and it was a huge success.

18:33.103 --> 18:35.379
We set up shop
facing Broadway

18:35.448 --> 18:38.103
so we get every
tourist's attention,

18:38.172 --> 18:39.965
and we call it
Inkburg Midtown.

18:40.034 --> 18:41.448
- It would have to be

18:41.517 --> 18:43.482
Infinitely 21 presents
Inkburg Midtown.

18:43.551 --> 18:44.931
- Absolutely.
Yeah.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.206
We offer a certain set
of flash pieces

18:48.275 --> 18:50.413
that people can only
get in the store.

18:50.482 --> 18:53.965
- So a very exclusive line.

18:54.034 --> 18:56.689
- The most exclusive.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.103
- I love it.
- Yeah?

19:00.172 --> 19:02.241
- Mm. And I love you.

19:02.310 --> 19:05.413
For bringing us that.
-  Right.

19:05.482 --> 19:07.172
So what do you think?

19:07.241 --> 19:09.482
- I'm a hugger.
-  Okay.

19:15.448 --> 19:16.827
- There was a...

19:16.896 --> 19:20.241
slight social media
slip-up last night.

19:20.310 --> 19:22.206
I don't know
if any of you saw it,

19:22.275 --> 19:24.310
but it was a silly
inside joke

19:24.379 --> 19:26.896
intended for one person,

19:26.965 --> 19:28.620
and it's embarrassing,

19:28.689 --> 19:33.241
but I'm sure it's gonna
blow over by this afternoon.

19:35.275 --> 19:37.068
- We understand
wanting to share

19:37.137 --> 19:39.103
your big...news.

19:39.172 --> 19:40.793
Bu when we invest,

19:40.862 --> 19:42.896
we want to feel comfortable
in our decision,

19:42.965 --> 19:45.896
and right now,
we're all feeling a little...

19:45.965 --> 19:48.000
uncomfortable.
- Well, the real issue

19:48.068 --> 19:49.448
is that it's just too much

19:49.517 --> 19:51.310
of a good thing.

19:51.379 --> 19:54.413
Meaning Kelsey's
internet presence.

19:54.482 --> 19:56.586
She has quite a following,

19:56.655 --> 19:59.206
which is a great thing
for Millennial

19:59.275 --> 20:01.620
and the only reason this post
is even being discussed.

20:01.689 --> 20:05.034
- Ms. Peters,
have you ever thought about

20:05.103 --> 20:07.413
separating your "presence,"
as it were,

20:07.482 --> 20:09.448
from the Millennial brand?

20:11.034 --> 20:15.172
- After this, I think that
might be a good idea.

20:15.241 --> 20:16.862
- You know, we think so too.

20:16.931 --> 20:18.517
We're still interested in
Millennial.

20:18.586 --> 20:20.517
That hasn't changed.

20:20.586 --> 20:23.275
But not with Ms. Peters
as publisher.

20:23.344 --> 20:26.068
Now, if Mr. Brooks could
return to that position,

20:26.137 --> 20:28.517
we'd keep funding in place.

20:28.586 --> 20:31.172
- Kelsey's judgment
should not be up for debate.

20:31.241 --> 20:32.655
This is a woman who has made

20:32.724 --> 20:35.103
nothing but smart decisions
for this company

20:35.172 --> 20:37.344
since she has been in a
position to make decisions.

20:37.413 --> 20:39.758
- Which is exactly why I...

20:39.827 --> 20:42.586
understand where the group
is coming from.

20:44.586 --> 20:46.931
This is the right move
for Millennial.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.827
- What are you doing?

20:48.896 --> 20:50.413
- Thank you for your
investment.

20:50.482 --> 20:54.310
You guys are in great hands.

20:55.275 --> 20:57.103
- Kelsey.

21:07.689 --> 21:10.448
- Hey, how'd it go?
- I need to stay behind a day

21:10.517 --> 21:13.931
to finalize some things
with the investors.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.758
- What about Kelsey?

21:15.827 --> 21:18.137
- You should go back
to New York with her.

21:18.206 --> 21:19.896
She needs you now.

21:19.965 --> 21:22.862
- And I need you to know
that that photo--

21:22.931 --> 21:25.689
it was just an ad
to sell clothes.

21:25.758 --> 21:27.310
That is all.

21:27.379 --> 21:29.206
And it just happened to be
with Josh.

21:29.275 --> 21:32.379
- I agree, but it made you
get on a plane to fly out here.

21:32.448 --> 21:34.896
I think that's what
we need to talk about.

21:34.965 --> 21:37.620
- I just didn't want you
to see it and wonder.

21:37.689 --> 21:39.172
- Yeah, I don't have to
see that to wonder.

21:39.241 --> 21:40.620
Everybody's got a past.

21:40.689 --> 21:44.103
But in order to have a future,
you move on from it.

21:44.172 --> 21:46.310
- Some people.
Other people live in the past

21:46.379 --> 21:48.724
in order to have a future.

21:48.793 --> 21:51.689
- Is that what you wanna
keep doing?

21:51.758 --> 21:53.620
- No.

21:53.689 --> 21:56.241
It's too complicated.

21:56.310 --> 21:59.068
And that last-minute plane
ticket was really expensive.

22:03.862 --> 22:07.000
- I'm not gonna see Josh
anymore.

22:21.034 --> 22:24.482
-  I went to bed
last night with everything.

22:24.551 --> 22:26.551
- You'll get it back.

22:26.620 --> 22:28.482
- I don't wanna go home.

22:28.551 --> 22:32.413

go wrong ♪

22:32.482 --> 22:34.379
