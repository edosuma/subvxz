02:29.000 --> 02:30.650
Leaving is a form of dying.

02:30.720 --> 02:34.406
One never arrives until
being at rest with You.

02:34.640 --> 02:39.771
You Lord, in your sudden flight
from Egypt, across sown paths...

02:39.920 --> 02:44.164
multiplied the bread and
healed the sick with the gospel...

02:44.240 --> 02:47.005
...before returning to the Father
with Your ascent.

02:47.080 --> 02:50.801
You took Abraham, father
of all believers, from his land.

02:51.120 --> 02:54.602
You showed him
the path to reach you.

02:54.720 --> 02:57.803
You, Lord, experienced migration.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.846
And You brought it upon all men
who know what it is to live...

03:02.360 --> 03:05.250
...and who seek safe passage
to the gates of Heaven.

03:24.800 --> 03:26.290
I'm sorry.

03:29.400 --> 03:31.482
I can never find the button.

03:36.840 --> 03:38.330
Squeeze its balls.

03:38.480 --> 03:40.084
I've already tried that.

03:41.440 --> 03:42.930
There it is!

03:43.000 --> 03:44.081
I told you!

04:09.680 --> 04:11.045
Goddammit!

04:15.800 --> 04:17.450
It's broken down, Lobo.

04:19.160 --> 04:21.003
Bring the stick
that's behind the seat.

04:21.079 --> 04:22.002
Lobo!

04:22.079 --> 04:24.845
Go see if there's
a mechanic back there.

04:25.200 --> 04:26.486
But quickly!

04:37.280 --> 04:39.487
Any of you know about cars?

04:41.120 --> 04:42.645
Come over here.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.809
- Hey, Don Primi.
- Yeah?

04:51.480 --> 04:52.891
This one.

04:56.080 --> 04:57.445
- Are you a mechanic?
- Yes.

04:57.520 --> 05:01.161
Take a look at this.
See if you can fix it.

05:01.240 --> 05:02.240
Shit.

05:03.640 --> 05:04.640
It just broke down?

05:04.680 --> 05:07.365
It was jerking around.
Didn't you feel it?

05:07.366 --> 05:08.486
Yes.

05:08.560 --> 05:11.131
Take a look
and see what's wrong.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.531
It's just that sometimes...

05:13.040 --> 05:14.804
...if this shit heats up...

05:16.280 --> 05:17.770
- Be careful...
- Careful, it's hot.

05:18.160 --> 05:19.286
There you go.

05:19.520 --> 05:22.000
- What the hell's wrong with it?
- Look at this.

05:22.480 --> 05:24.767
- What is that?
- The brush is screwed.

05:24.840 --> 05:26.888
So fix it! You're a mechanic!

05:26.960 --> 05:29.566
That can't be fixed.
It has to be towed.

05:29.680 --> 05:31.682
Who the fuck
is going to tow us?

05:31.760 --> 05:32.760
I don't know.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.768
- Excuse me.
- Whatever.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.366
Yes, boss?

05:41.440 --> 05:45.365
The truck broke down.
We're stranded near the badlands.

05:45.440 --> 05:46.601
Hey...

05:47.080 --> 05:49.924
Do you know
if we're gonna cross over here?

05:50.040 --> 05:51.724
They're figuring it out

05:51.800 --> 05:55.327
There's twelve. And two more
that we picked up in San Pedro.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.923
I'll tell them. Okay then.

06:01.560 --> 06:03.210
Don't worry about it.

06:04.360 --> 06:06.806
Lobo, I've got bad news.

06:07.160 --> 06:08.810
You're crossing through
the badlands.

06:08.880 --> 06:11.565
What are you talking about?
We agreed to cross at Sote.

06:11.680 --> 06:14.570
That was before.
Look at the truck.

06:14.640 --> 06:16.642
This route is longer
and more dangerous.

06:16.720 --> 06:20.042
I know, but we can't
just leave them here.

06:20.120 --> 06:21.451
No, you're right

06:21.520 --> 06:23.568
Look Don Primi,
I would never let you down.

06:23.640 --> 06:26.120
I'll do it, but it'll be
more expensive.

06:26.200 --> 06:28.407
Come on Lobo,
don't break my balls!

06:28.680 --> 06:31.001
Okay. 100 pesos each,
but get moving.

06:31.080 --> 06:32.411
200, Don Primi.

06:33.640 --> 06:35.324
Fucking Lobo!

06:35.400 --> 06:38.449
200.
But round up the cattle, quickly!

06:38.520 --> 06:39.965
Let's go.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.645
- Lobo...
- What?

06:41.720 --> 06:43.643
We said we wouldn't do
the badlands.

06:43.644 --> 06:44.687
What?

06:44.760 --> 06:47.047
Are you afraid of getting lost?

06:47.120 --> 06:49.521
No, but you know what happened
to the Sonoyta gang.

06:49.600 --> 06:53.127
Those idiots were running drugs
and got killed by the cartel.

06:53.200 --> 06:55.965
Don't whine.
You even got a bonus!

06:56.960 --> 06:58.644
Listen.

06:59.320 --> 07:01.971
The United States is that way.

07:02.280 --> 07:03.520
Okay?

07:04.400 --> 07:07.290
Come on! Get out of the truck!
Move. move!

07:07.640 --> 07:08.766
Come on!

07:11.120 --> 07:13.327
Can you throw me
my backpack, please?

07:13.680 --> 07:15.808
Keep an eye on them.
They are worth a lot of money.

07:15.960 --> 07:18.361
Good luck and be safe.

07:18.560 --> 07:20.210
God bess you.

07:21.800 --> 07:24.280
Come on, hurry up!
Let's go!

07:30.880 --> 07:32.848
Hurry up!

10:09.640 --> 10:11.722
Welcome to the United States,
scumbags.

10:12.680 --> 10:15.604
From now on we have
to be very careful.

10:15.680 --> 10:17.569
If you see or hear anything...

10:17.640 --> 10:21.645
...even if it's a fucking rancher,
you've got to hide.

10:23.120 --> 10:24.360
Is that clear?

10:25.840 --> 10:27.205
Hey you, come help him!

10:27.320 --> 10:30.164
Hold the fence so we can cross.

10:31.320 --> 10:33.004
Let's go!

10:33.200 --> 10:34.361
Hurry up!

10:44.520 --> 10:46.648
Get down!
Get down!

10:47.280 --> 10:48.327
Come on.

11:47.680 --> 11:50.365
Run! Run! To the bushes!
Come on! Come on!

11:50.600 --> 11:51.806
Hurry up!

12:01.560 --> 12:03.767
Run! Come on, assholes!

12:34.040 --> 12:36.566
- It's your first time crossing?
- Yes. It's my first time.

12:36.640 --> 12:38.768
Do you have family there?

12:40.440 --> 12:42.761
Yes. Cousins...

12:49.560 --> 12:50.561
Lobo...

12:50.640 --> 12:53.564
Don't drink all your water,
we've still got a day and a half to go.

12:53.640 --> 12:55.244
You've been warned.
What do you want?

12:55.320 --> 12:56.810
Come over here!

13:07.760 --> 13:09.091
Leave me alone!

13:09.480 --> 13:10.811
Listen to me, you jerk!

13:11.720 --> 13:13.927
I've only known you for three days.

13:14.800 --> 13:18.691
My parents asked you to take care
of me, but you're not my husband.

13:20.440 --> 13:22.602
Don't overreact!
It's not a big deal.

13:32.400 --> 13:34.448
Hey, man... Hey!

13:35.720 --> 13:37.165
You have a cigarette?

13:37.240 --> 13:39.242
- What?
- You don't have a cigarette?

13:39.520 --> 13:40.851
I don't smoke.

13:41.080 --> 13:42.491
Me neither.

13:43.160 --> 13:45.970
But this lady is asking you
to leave her alone.

13:46.640 --> 13:48.290
That's none of your business.

13:48.440 --> 13:52.047
I know, it's just that...
we're trying to rest...

13:55.040 --> 13:56.121
...it's hot...

13:56.400 --> 13:58.482
Cheer up and let's go!

14:02.760 --> 14:04.091
Let's go!

14:50.520 --> 14:51.726
Hurry!

14:53.560 --> 14:56.370
- Hurry up!
- I'm walking as fast as I can!

14:57.560 --> 15:00.211
Do you want help
with your bag?

15:01.040 --> 15:03.042
No... I'm fine.

15:03.120 --> 15:05.168
It's okay, we can take turns.

15:06.320 --> 15:08.163
Let me help you for a few minutes.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.004
No, thanks.

17:05.440 --> 17:06.601
Lobo!

17:16.920 --> 17:18.330
Wait for us!

17:22.200 --> 17:24.601
Lobo! Wait, asshole!

17:25.200 --> 17:26.929
Don't be a jerk!

17:33.160 --> 17:34.491
Don't leave us!

17:36.000 --> 17:37.331
Fucking asshole!

17:43.320 --> 17:45.641
Hurry up!
Move it, assholes!

17:45.720 --> 17:48.564
Can't you see they're leaving us?

17:59.520 --> 18:01.204
Goddammit!

18:05.960 --> 18:07.246
What's wrong?

18:07.480 --> 18:08.686
I'm exhausted.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.084
You don't have a choice, man.

18:13.120 --> 18:14.849
I know it's hard.

18:14.960 --> 18:17.008
Come on!

18:17.240 --> 18:18.401
Let's go!

18:19.040 --> 18:20.690
Breathe, just breathe.

18:21.640 --> 18:23.244
Have you crossed before?

18:23.360 --> 18:25.124
- What?
- Have you crossed before?

18:25.200 --> 18:26.247
Yeah.

18:26.360 --> 18:28.806
No one told me
it'd be this hard.

18:30.280 --> 18:31.566
I just want to get there.

18:31.567 --> 18:32.639
Okay.

18:32.640 --> 18:35.723
Just take a deep breath
and walk. Come on.

18:53.720 --> 18:55.324
They left us.

18:57.040 --> 18:58.166
Lobo!

19:14.880 --> 19:16.211
Sir...

19:17.840 --> 19:19.365
Your friend's back there.

19:26.560 --> 19:29.086
That's what happens
when you're slow.

19:29.280 --> 19:32.602
Hurry up or you'll end up
like those assholes!

19:53.160 --> 19:54.685
Down! Get down!

19:57.280 --> 19:59.442
Hide! Everyone hide!

20:02.120 --> 20:04.122
- What?
- The truck!

20:07.080 --> 20:08.161
Oh shit!

21:01.920 --> 21:03.081
Who's that?

21:03.400 --> 21:05.482
- The Border Patrol?
- No.

21:07.320 --> 21:08.651
No, it's not, right?

21:08.720 --> 21:09.721
No.

21:57.560 --> 21:58.641
Oh shit!

22:54.480 --> 22:55.891
They're shooting at us!

22:56.200 --> 22:57.201
Run!

23:22.400 --> 23:23.640
Stay close!

23:30.640 --> 23:33.371
Come on, come on!
Stay close!

25:09.720 --> 25:11.165
Let's go.

25:13.400 --> 25:14.731
What do we do, man?

25:15.040 --> 25:16.371
I don't know.

25:16.680 --> 25:17.681
Don't go!

25:18.760 --> 25:19.760
Come on!

25:19.920 --> 25:21.331
Come on!

25:21.400 --> 25:23.289
Go! Go!

27:51.960 --> 27:53.325
Hey!

27:53.560 --> 27:54.721
Wait!

27:59.920 --> 28:01.684
Let's go! Come on!

29:08.880 --> 29:10.370
Hurry, hurry!

30:00.120 --> 30:01.281
Ramiro!

30:37.120 --> 30:39.009
Come on! Don't turn around!

32:08.880 --> 32:11.087
Dog!

32:14.640 --> 32:15.926
Hurry! Hurry!

34:48.360 --> 34:49.850
Now what?

34:50.719 --> 34:51.960
What do we do?

35:10.040 --> 35:11.041
Come on!

35:11.520 --> 35:12.646
Jump!

35:14.160 --> 35:15.366
Go!

35:18.400 --> 35:19.242
Jump!

35:19.320 --> 35:20.207
I can't!

35:20.280 --> 35:21.281
I'll catch you!

35:21.360 --> 35:22.407
I can't!

35:29.360 --> 35:30.566
Good job!

35:30.840 --> 35:32.046
You did it!

36:25.200 --> 36:26.361
Man!

36:26.440 --> 36:27.646
Hey, man!

36:28.720 --> 36:30.245
Wait for us!

36:35.280 --> 36:36.280
Wait!

36:36.400 --> 36:37.526
What?

36:37.720 --> 36:38.881
Which way?

36:38.960 --> 36:40.325
I don't know!

36:40.960 --> 36:43.930
I told Lobo not to come this way!
I don't even know this place!

36:44.400 --> 36:46.004
So what do we do?

36:48.320 --> 36:50.800
We have to stay together.

36:51.560 --> 36:54.769
So don't leave us, okay?

36:55.560 --> 36:56.846
Come on.

38:18.560 --> 38:20.449
Will you hold me?

38:25.000 --> 38:26.047
I got it.

38:39.120 --> 38:40.326
Okay.

38:41.560 --> 38:42.721
Let's go.

40:04.360 --> 40:06.044
Move back!

42:29.480 --> 42:31.562
Please... Help me.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
Listen.

44:40.360 --> 44:43.330
I'm sorry for the guy
you were with.

44:44.720 --> 44:46.245
I barely knew him.

44:48.960 --> 44:52.282
My parents hired him
to help me cross the border.

44:58.480 --> 45:01.131
That asshole did
awful things to me.

45:03.360 --> 45:05.488
But he didn't deserve
to die like that.

45:07.520 --> 45:09.648
No one deserved
to die like that.

45:17.800 --> 45:19.723
I didn't even want to come.

45:20.920 --> 45:22.843
My parents forced me to.

45:25.520 --> 45:28.410
They say our town
is very dangerous.

45:28.480 --> 45:30.164
That I'd be safer here.

45:34.400 --> 45:37.961
If only they knew
what things are like here.

45:41.440 --> 45:44.171
I have a son
waiting for me in Oakland.

45:47.480 --> 45:48.811
I had already applied...

45:48.960 --> 45:51.361
...for my residence visa.

45:53.920 --> 45:57.083
One day, a cop stopped me
because of a broken headlight.

45:57.640 --> 45:59.802
One thing led to another...

46:00.040 --> 46:03.044
...and I ended up
in a Detention Center.

46:05.000 --> 46:08.368
Just before I got deported,
my son came to visit and...

46:08.440 --> 46:10.329
...he gave me this teddy bear...

46:11.760 --> 46:14.923
...to take care of me
when they sent me back to Mexico.

46:20.400 --> 46:22.243
I told him that...

46:24.040 --> 46:26.964
...that I would get it back to him.

46:33.720 --> 46:35.799
My wife told me...

46:35.800 --> 46:38.690
...not to tell that to my son...

46:38.760 --> 46:41.240
...not to make empty promises.

46:41.520 --> 46:43.807
She said I never keep
my promises.

46:45.880 --> 46:49.362
That I would take this opportunity
to disappear.

46:56.560 --> 46:58.130
No fucking way.

47:00.280 --> 47:02.408
I don't want to disappear.

50:18.520 --> 50:20.488
You know about cars, don't you?

50:20.560 --> 50:21.560
Why?

50:21.880 --> 50:23.166
The gringo is over there!

50:23.240 --> 50:24.446
Where?

50:25.400 --> 50:26.606
Over there.

50:27.520 --> 50:29.648
Let's steal his truck.

50:34.560 --> 50:37.530
But first we have
to get rid of the dog.

50:37.920 --> 50:39.524
I'll take care of the dog.

50:39.880 --> 50:41.962
I'll just need
your teddy bear.

52:50.560 --> 52:51.641
Come on!

52:54.480 --> 52:55.481
He's coming!

53:00.520 --> 53:01.520
Wait!

53:02.760 --> 53:03.760
Got it!

53:34.880 --> 53:36.689
There it is!
Let's go!

54:07.240 --> 54:09.641
What did I tell you?

54:11.200 --> 54:14.409
I'll drive you straight to Chicago!
Fucking gringos, kiss my ass!

54:15.000 --> 54:17.571
Hang on.
Hang on tight!

54:22.560 --> 54:23.971
Wait. Hold on!

57:01.560 --> 57:03.244
Enough! I can't do this anymore.

57:03.320 --> 57:05.561
I can't... I don't feel good.

57:06.840 --> 57:09.650
Let's stop here and rest a little.

57:26.640 --> 57:29.211
Okay! Here you go.

57:49.240 --> 57:51.481
It's okay. It's okay.

58:15.280 --> 58:17.601
I'm gonna have
to leave you here.

58:17.720 --> 58:20.326
You can't walk.
I have to leave you here.

58:21.600 --> 58:24.001
If I stay, we'll both die.

58:24.600 --> 58:26.841
If you leave, he will kill me.

58:26.920 --> 58:29.890
He'll kill me too.
And I have a son.

58:29.960 --> 58:32.201
Don't leave me here.

58:32.320 --> 58:34.641
I don't want to die alone, please.

58:34.720 --> 58:38.088
Forgive me. Keep the water.

01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:36.165
Goddammit.

01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:53.921
Over here!

01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:00.291
Help!

01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:57.006
Help me!

01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:02.442
Somebody help me!

01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:52.526
Fucking gringo,
don't you ever get tired?

01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:24.769
You killed them all!

01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:27.281
As if we were animals!

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:35.602
Son of a bitch.

01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:37.644
You're a son of a bitch!

01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:32.283
Let the desert kill you.

01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:15.201
Come.

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:16.965
Come on, let's go.

01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:32.042
Just one last push.

01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:37.804
We're almost there.

01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:30.762
We're almost there.

01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:35.528
The highway is right there.

01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:39.209
One last push.

01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:41.731
Carry on.

01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:44.449
Come on, carry on.
