00:00.820 --> 00:03.740
[TORI] All of our victims live
in Bondi. So does Real Man.

00:03.940 --> 00:05.420
But why was he at the beach that day?

00:05.580 --> 00:07.180
Because he's thumbing his nose at us.

00:07.380 --> 00:09.420
So the killer keeps the victim's phones

00:09.620 --> 00:11.140
and he uses them as bait for the next.

00:11.340 --> 00:12.815
- You know about this?
- Yeah, it's me.

00:12.820 --> 00:14.620
There's someone luring
people with that app.

00:14.820 --> 00:16.379
Don will flip if he finds out.

00:16.580 --> 00:19.460
Don doesn't want to know
a thing about any of it.

00:19.660 --> 00:21.740
1989. The Pointers.

00:21.940 --> 00:24.700
Secrets you know could give
answers to grieving families.

00:24.900 --> 00:26.820
The O'Donohues were Hammer's bullyboys.

00:27.020 --> 00:29.100
They got off on violence.
They haven't changed.

00:29.307 --> 00:31.515
A gay man went missing the same night

00:31.540 --> 00:34.980
that Toohey and Hammers had a
bloodied weapon taken off them.

00:35.180 --> 00:36.580
I'd like to have it tested for DNA.

00:36.660 --> 00:38.220
Chalmers parted with this, did he?

00:38.420 --> 00:40.860
He thinks that it might
link to an unsolved murder.

00:41.060 --> 00:44.020
Your brother
you think he was murdered.

00:44.220 --> 00:46.580
Is Toohey gonna talk? 'Cause
if he talks, we'll all go down.

00:46.660 --> 00:48.102
Who did you see killed?

00:48.140 --> 00:50.460
Wear a wire, get Hammers to talk.

00:51.120 --> 00:52.680
It's Toohey.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.074

01:08.377 --> 01:09.380
[PEEL] Toohey.

01:11.884 --> 01:13.644
He was like a bloody son.

01:14.938 --> 01:17.915
I watched that kid grow up.
I coached him in the Colts.

01:17.947 --> 01:19.976
[NICK] Yeah, I know you
two were close, boss.

01:20.165 --> 01:22.075
Yeah, I want the prick who did it.

01:22.100 --> 01:23.595
Yeah, yeah, we'll get him.

01:23.620 --> 01:24.875
Who found him?

01:24.900 --> 01:26.663
Oscar Taylor.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.288
Oh, that mate of yours.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.020
He's Eddy Everywhere.

01:35.420 --> 01:37.700
[TAYLOR] I was up there taking photos.

01:38.275 --> 01:39.595
I wanted to get that moment

01:39.620 --> 01:41.900
when the moon looks like
it's rising out of the ocean.

01:42.369 --> 01:45.624
Right, right. And that's when
you saw the body in the water?

01:45.717 --> 01:47.483
No, not at first.

01:47.508 --> 01:49.749
At first it was just
a shadow in the pool.

01:51.460 --> 01:52.506
Tori.

01:53.813 --> 01:55.614
Just a second, Oz.

01:57.395 --> 01:59.635
Look, I know he's your
mate and everything,

01:59.660 --> 02:01.820
but let him answer, don't lead him.

02:04.329 --> 02:05.849
He's not a suspect.

02:05.944 --> 02:07.624
Everyone's a suspect, you know that.

02:10.755 --> 02:12.195
What have forensics got?

02:12.899 --> 02:15.339
Clothes folded neatly over there.

02:15.940 --> 02:20.100
They reckon from the blood on
the towel and on the ground,

02:20.300 --> 02:24.140
that he was stabbed and then
either pushed or fell into the pool.

02:24.340 --> 02:25.340
All right.

02:25.365 --> 02:28.355
There was also something else
on the towel possibly semen.

02:28.380 --> 02:31.228
So it could have been a Thrustr hook-up?

02:32.540 --> 02:34.971
- Have you found a phone?
- Still looking.

03:28.540 --> 03:32.907
[TORI] Toohey was preparing to give
up Hammers and the O'Donohue brothers.

03:34.446 --> 03:35.530
What are you talking about?

03:35.555 --> 03:39.075
We think he had evidence connecting
them to assaults and murders

03:39.100 --> 03:40.715
in the '80s and '90s.

03:41.809 --> 03:44.235
- Why wasn't I told about this?
- I was gonna tell you, sir.

03:44.260 --> 03:45.700
We spoke last night.

03:45.735 --> 03:48.706
He was gonna come in this
morning, make a statement.

03:50.140 --> 03:51.620
Fuck me.

03:51.995 --> 03:53.795
My money is on the O'Donohue brothers.

03:53.820 --> 03:55.395
Can we get a warrant, please?

03:56.338 --> 03:58.235
No, let's just sit back.

03:58.260 --> 04:01.026
We'll monitor their
chatter on the phone taps.

04:02.315 --> 04:03.795
Any joy with the murder weapon?

04:03.820 --> 04:06.269
Ah, uniforms are still searching.

04:06.860 --> 04:08.855
And I spoke to the council
and asked them to hold off

04:08.860 --> 04:10.555
picking up the garbage until we're done.

04:10.580 --> 04:13.436
Well, can we get on with it? I don't
want to be smelling this case from here.

04:13.460 --> 04:14.900
Has anybody got any good news?

04:15.275 --> 04:17.195
We recovered Toohey's phone.

04:17.220 --> 04:18.755
He made three calls last night,

04:18.779 --> 04:21.380
all of them to his
lawyer, Simon Mawbrey.

04:21.579 --> 04:24.595
I called Mawbrey this morning.
He's not picking up, called in sick.

04:24.620 --> 04:26.700
I think somebody should pay him a visit.

04:26.861 --> 04:29.301
- I'll do that.
- All right, that's it.

04:31.014 --> 04:33.934
You two... just a word.

04:38.947 --> 04:41.227
- [DOOR CLOSES]
- Oscar Taylor.

04:42.623 --> 04:44.044
With all due respect...

04:44.069 --> 04:47.389
Everyone knows he frequents
the beach at all hours

04:47.414 --> 04:50.134
with some bullshit
photographic blog or something.

04:50.990 --> 04:53.300
Investigations are
continuing, Detective.

04:53.781 --> 04:57.111
So for now you treat him like a witness,

04:57.136 --> 04:58.645
not like an old mate.

05:00.195 --> 05:01.555
Yes, sir.

05:01.993 --> 05:05.150
And it goes without saying that
I need to have complete faith

05:05.175 --> 05:08.134
in the integrity of every
officer under my command.

05:09.595 --> 05:10.795
Yes, sir.

05:11.696 --> 05:13.195
The newspaper article.

05:13.939 --> 05:15.482
Sir?

05:18.659 --> 05:21.707
I'm prepared to overlook
the odd lapse of judgement

05:21.740 --> 05:24.620
and the odd investigative fuck-up.

05:25.362 --> 05:27.795
But I will not be lied to.

05:28.281 --> 05:30.667
And I will not be made a fool of.

05:33.883 --> 05:35.135
That'll be all.

05:40.380 --> 05:42.600
[BRENDA] Toohey's post-mortem report.

05:42.989 --> 05:44.989
Okay.

05:46.060 --> 05:50.233
Blood splatter suggests the first
wound, the deepest one, see here,

05:50.435 --> 05:53.501
that happened when Toohey was
lying on the towel, face-up.

05:53.735 --> 05:55.355
And we nearly missed this.

05:55.380 --> 05:56.980
Traces of hair. Shaved.

05:57.355 --> 06:00.235
Is it the same hair found
at Haris's and Cohen's?

06:00.260 --> 06:03.723
We're running a DNA
comparison. No results back yet.

06:03.780 --> 06:06.410
- But...
- Educated guess?

06:06.973 --> 06:08.835
They could be the same.

06:08.860 --> 06:12.755
So the person who killed Haris
and Cohen also killed Toohey.

06:12.780 --> 06:14.675
Assuming the DNA matches.

06:14.700 --> 06:16.075
What about animal fur?

06:16.100 --> 06:18.220
Nup. Nothing yet.

06:18.332 --> 06:21.350
And we're still waiting on test
results for the semen and the blood.

06:21.595 --> 06:25.555
It's the same killer, but the
psychology, it's totally different.

06:25.819 --> 06:29.155
The attack on Toohey,
it's in a public place,

06:29.180 --> 06:31.468
there's no ligatures,
there's no trophies.

06:31.500 --> 06:34.180
It's a frenzied assault.

06:34.205 --> 06:36.940
Yeah, it's like this one was personal.

06:37.315 --> 06:40.075
So, whoever killed him
took him by surprise

06:40.100 --> 06:41.874
or was someone he knew and trusted.

06:42.048 --> 06:44.008
Yeah, like a lawyer.

06:54.474 --> 06:55.715
[KNOCK AT DOOR]

06:56.349 --> 06:58.035
[MAWBREY] Piss off!

06:58.552 --> 07:00.992
[KNOCKING CONTINUES]

07:05.155 --> 07:07.355
I heard it on the news this morning.

07:07.380 --> 07:09.500
That must have come as quite a shock.

07:09.770 --> 07:12.810
Oh, thank you for that statement
of the bleeding obvious, Detective.

07:13.373 --> 07:16.372
We believe you spoke
to Mr Toohey last night.

07:17.300 --> 07:19.580
I spoke with my client quite regularly.

07:19.950 --> 07:24.075
We also believe you
met him at Bronte Baths.

07:24.140 --> 07:26.620
[CHUCKLES] Really?

07:27.232 --> 07:29.995
Can I ask you where you were
between 9:30 and 11:00 last night?

07:30.020 --> 07:32.482
You can ask all you like, I'm
not gonna make any comment.

07:32.540 --> 07:34.915
So you don't deny that you were there?

07:35.080 --> 07:36.400
Nice try, Detective,

07:36.460 --> 07:39.883
but I'm not confirming or
denying I was anywhere last night.

07:43.318 --> 07:46.678
Did he talk to you about Kyle
Hampton or the O'Donohues?

07:48.940 --> 07:51.740
Okay, I think this conversation is over.

07:51.831 --> 07:54.351
Did he tell you he was planning
on speaking to the police?

07:54.376 --> 07:55.816
He was going to tell us what he knew

07:55.841 --> 07:57.861
about murders committed
by the Pointers gang.

07:58.060 --> 07:59.944
Please leave.

08:05.555 --> 08:08.195
You know, I would like to find
the person that killed Toohey.

08:08.220 --> 08:10.180
I would have thought you'd
want to help with that.

08:10.205 --> 08:13.189
I'm dismayed and devastated at
the news of my client's death.

08:13.221 --> 08:15.540
I have nothing further to add. Goodbye.

08:20.234 --> 08:22.664
[NICK] "Dismayed and
devastated", my arse.

08:22.875 --> 08:24.235
You think he's hiding something?

08:24.260 --> 08:27.060
He's a lawyer. Of course
he's hiding something.

08:28.395 --> 08:31.340
- DNA results?
- Settle, petal.

08:31.540 --> 08:33.140
They'll get onto it,
hopefully this year.

08:33.561 --> 08:36.577
This bloke just called in,
wants to speak to a detective.

08:37.292 --> 08:40.546
Looks like all that publicity's
flushed out a former victim.

08:47.903 --> 08:49.435
[MAN] Looking good.

08:50.943 --> 08:54.555
I was walking through Cardinal
Park rattling car keys.

08:54.580 --> 08:57.980
That's a kind of signal
looking for company.

08:58.653 --> 09:01.635
And... Ah, with the others.

09:02.286 --> 09:07.035
And a young man stood
up, unzipped his fly.

09:07.060 --> 09:08.980
I realised it was Brett O'Donohue.

09:09.133 --> 09:12.653
I was shocked. I said, "What
do you think you're doing?"

09:12.900 --> 09:15.780
I was struck down from
behind. Didn't see it coming.

09:16.151 --> 09:18.694
They cracked my skull.

09:19.275 --> 09:21.075
I still get headaches.

09:21.378 --> 09:25.267
Hammers was shouting instructions.

09:25.292 --> 09:27.260
How did you know their names?

09:27.460 --> 09:29.620
I was a football umpire. Under-16s.

09:29.820 --> 09:32.524
I knew their names from their jerseys.

09:32.736 --> 09:34.392
They were gonna...

09:35.121 --> 09:37.179
throw me off the cliff.

09:37.947 --> 09:42.180
Hammers' girlfriend was
shouting, "Kill the fag!"

09:44.220 --> 09:46.020
Jeremy, how did you get away?

09:46.220 --> 09:50.300
Back then I was fit. I ran. They
came after, but I was faster.

09:50.675 --> 09:54.915
I hid in some bushes, they ran past.

09:54.940 --> 10:00.516
One stopped. I could see a
tattoo on his foot, a tear.

10:01.396 --> 10:05.024
I remember wondering what
the kid was crying for.

10:06.340 --> 10:07.780
Then they ran on.

10:08.951 --> 10:10.671
Did you go to the police?

10:11.020 --> 10:15.556
Yeah. But the interrogation was like
I was the one who committed a crime.

10:15.963 --> 10:18.581
Couldn't push it, so...

10:18.606 --> 10:20.147
gave up.

10:21.060 --> 10:22.580
Sorry.

10:49.711 --> 10:52.090
- How's tricks, Tommy Tomcat?
- Please leave.

10:52.115 --> 10:53.715
You're not welcome here.

10:53.740 --> 10:55.660
That's not nice. We're
old mates, remember?

10:55.685 --> 10:58.005
Yeah, that friendship ended
a long time ago, I'm afraid.

10:58.520 --> 11:00.120
Wrong answer.

11:20.962 --> 11:22.802
Talk to us, Thomas.

11:26.635 --> 11:28.915
It was the O'Donohue
brothers, wasn't it?

11:28.940 --> 11:31.660
Bit of a warning. Keep your mouth shut.

11:32.746 --> 11:35.635
All I know is that some things
are meant to stay buried.

11:36.332 --> 11:39.675
Like what happened on those
cliffs at Cardinal Park, hey?

11:40.160 --> 11:41.195
No...

11:41.220 --> 11:43.604
We can protect you.

11:44.601 --> 11:46.921
I put my trust in a higher power.

11:47.823 --> 11:50.275
This body is just a vessel, Detective.

11:50.698 --> 11:53.698
When my body dies, my spirit lives on.

11:57.825 --> 12:01.945
Thomas, will you tell us what
the tear-drop tattoos mean?

12:02.376 --> 12:03.989
I don't know.

12:14.768 --> 12:16.448
There's gonna be nowhere to hide

12:16.706 --> 12:20.106
when the O'Donohues find out
you ratted Brett to the cops.

12:23.340 --> 12:26.430
No. You... you can't say that.

12:28.196 --> 12:30.075
Then talk to us.

12:30.514 --> 12:33.434
Or are you in a hurry to find
out where you spirit goes next?

12:40.145 --> 12:42.689
The tatts were like a medal of honour...

12:45.356 --> 12:47.311
for taking a life.

12:57.593 --> 13:00.235
The first noble truth
of life is suffering.

13:00.619 --> 13:02.882
To live, you must endure.

13:04.700 --> 13:08.820
I can't escape the past, but...
I can't live with it either.

13:19.091 --> 13:20.955
Trust me, Tommy won't say a thing.

13:21.143 --> 13:23.396
And the other fuckers...
Brett's on all, mate.

13:23.784 --> 13:26.104
He's very thorough.
Ticking them off one by one.

13:26.900 --> 13:30.100
- What about the bitch?
- Shit.

13:30.125 --> 13:31.365
She's gonna be trouble.

13:31.740 --> 13:35.220
Don't worry. This will
be right up Brett's alley.

13:37.035 --> 13:38.795
Who's the bitch?

13:39.730 --> 13:43.206
They always had girls
hanging around. Beats me why.

13:43.448 --> 13:45.195
Any girls in particular?

13:45.612 --> 13:47.275
Yeah. Sally Williams.

13:47.475 --> 13:49.955
Came in by train from the west.

13:49.980 --> 13:52.860
- She was into footy players.
- Like Toohey.

13:53.060 --> 13:54.700
Except Toohey played the field.

13:54.900 --> 13:57.100
She took up with Hammers on the rebound.

13:57.409 --> 13:59.049
Didn't last long.

13:59.140 --> 14:01.420
The beatings must have got too much.

14:01.795 --> 14:03.426
That'd be right.

14:03.940 --> 14:06.140
She didn't report it,
or he wasn't charged?

14:06.340 --> 14:10.380
Well, cops usually look
the other way for a reason.

14:11.632 --> 14:13.752
Are you saying he was
somebody's informant?

14:13.820 --> 14:15.460
Maybe still is.

33:38.197 --> 33:40.626
I know it's hard. Dad, listen.

33:40.794 --> 33:42.594
- He did not go swimming.
- Tori.

33:42.619 --> 33:46.418
He did not drown, he was
set on by a gang of boys.

33:46.484 --> 33:47.964
Tori, stop.

33:48.066 --> 33:49.626
It's ridiculous.

33:49.974 --> 33:52.864
He had no reason to go to Cardinal Park.

33:57.439 --> 34:01.418
Dad, he was there to meet
somebody who he cared about.

34:02.466 --> 34:05.025
Who cared about him.

34:09.563 --> 34:11.462
He was there to meet Oscar.

34:15.039 --> 34:17.685
Please, Dad, just... have a look.

34:19.181 --> 34:20.755
Oscar's a fuckin' liar.

34:20.799 --> 34:24.429
Oscar is your friend, Dad.
Why would he lie to you?

34:25.536 --> 34:26.976
Shane was not gay.

34:27.866 --> 34:29.429
So, it's okay for
Oscar, but not your son?

34:29.453 --> 34:31.768
You know Oscar's
somebody's son too, Dad.

34:31.815 --> 34:33.976
Hey, just don't twist my words.

34:34.106 --> 34:37.904
Please, Dad, speak to Oscar.
Listen to what he has to say.

34:39.386 --> 34:43.005
No. This is just another
one of your little stories.

34:43.094 --> 34:46.069
You were always telling
stories about Shane.

34:49.985 --> 34:51.780
Huh. How can you...

34:51.918 --> 34:54.856
Broke your mother's heart
when Shane was taken from us.

34:55.275 --> 34:57.635
Yes, but not by the sea, Dad.

35:03.830 --> 35:05.324
Shane was gay

35:05.627 --> 35:08.067
and some bastards killed him for that.

[DOOR SLAMS]

35:35.768 --> 35:38.347
He's walking around like he owns
the place, and I tap him on the back

35:38.371 --> 35:41.131
and I'm like, "You wanna meet
the guy who owns the place?

35:41.506 --> 35:42.786
"He's right here."

35:42.811 --> 35:44.251
What an idiot.

35:47.186 --> 35:50.444
- I know.
- Good for you, Toots.

35:51.987 --> 35:53.670

you and the Pointers.

36:12.839 --> 36:14.279
It's all right, mate.

36:15.026 --> 36:18.861
You bash innocent men and
you throw them to their death.

Is that right?

36:22.666 --> 36:25.650
I was there. I saw you.

36:27.946 --> 36:31.640
- Bullshit.
- That's what I'm telling the cops.

36:32.546 --> 36:37.164
I saw you bash a man, then throw
him off the cliff at Cardinal Park.

36:39.026 --> 36:40.466
You're lying.

- Oh, some shit at Cardinal Park.

say about Cardinal Park?

Nothing's lower than a copper's dog

37:37.426 --> 37:40.266
ratting out his mates
to cover his own arse.

38:01.419 --> 38:03.581
Nothing. Nothing he didn't need to know.

38:05.466 --> 38:08.586
Shit, you've been feeding him information
about the investigation, haven't you?

38:08.786 --> 38:10.706
Look, he would have found out anyway.

38:11.586 --> 38:14.604
You wound him up to verbal Hammers.

38:18.789 --> 38:21.615
the weapon that Chalmers
took off the Pointers...

38:22.586 --> 38:25.693

it's a familial link.

Oh, shit.

38:30.106 --> 38:34.531
And you told Oscar and that's
why he came after Hammers.

38:38.186 --> 38:40.106
This is bullshit!

38:40.306 --> 38:42.746
You don't even know
what happened that night.

38:42.946 --> 38:45.026
How did they get the club?
Who struck the first blow?

38:45.051 --> 38:48.101
Was it one of them, all of
them? Was it someone else?

38:48.126 --> 38:49.566
I don't know,

38:49.866 --> 38:54.146
but I do know that someone has
to be held responsible for this.

Yes. And they will be.

If you want me off this case,

39:25.481 --> 39:27.706
you're gonna have to tell Peel yourself.

39:50.426 --> 39:52.106
The ice found on Brett O'Donohue

39:52.131 --> 39:55.601
matches the ice found at the
Rexhaj and Cohen murder scenes.

39:55.626 --> 39:57.306
It's the same chemical composition.

39:57.506 --> 39:59.546
But it still doesn't
put them there, does it?

39:59.746 --> 40:03.099
Well, if they're not our killers,
then one of their clients is.

40:03.186 --> 40:05.626
Yeah, or someone who gets their
ice from one of their clients,

40:05.706 --> 40:08.146
which could be about
half of bloody Bondi.

40:08.171 --> 40:09.958
