1:23:14.256 --> 1:23:14.590
ARE WORTH IT.

1:23:14.590 --> 1:23:18.427
>> WELL, YOU CAN ALWAYS TEF
A DOG DOESN'T LIKE SOMEBOD,

1:23:18.427 --> 1:23:19.361
THAT IS A LITTLE BIT OF A
RED FLAG.

1:23:22.130 --> 1:23:22.965

1:23:55.497 --> 1:23:56.498
WE WERE INTERRUPTED.

1:23:56.498 --> 1:23:57.566
>> LOOK AT THESE.

1:23:57.566 --> 1:23:59.701

THEM TOGETHER AND MAKE LITE

1:23:59.701 --> 1:24:03.539
"BACHELOR" SHOES.

>> I'VE NEVER HAD TO FIGHTR
SOMEBODY'S ATTENTION BEFOR,

1:24:07.809 --> 1:24:13.549
YOU KNOW, I GO AFTER WHAT I
WANT, AND I AM DRAWN TO CO.

1:24:13.549 --> 1:24:15.651
I THINK THIS IS OUR MOMENTO
CONNECT AND IDEALLY FALL IN

LOVE, CREATE THIS WHOLE ENE
AMAZING LIFESTYLE TOGETHERE

1:24:20.322 --> 1:24:23.559
NEED TO SPEND A LITTLE BITE
THAN A COUPLE MINUTES WITHH OTHER.

1:24:23.559 --> 1:24:25.160
>> EXCUSE ME, I'M SO SORRYO
INTERRUPT.

1:24:25.160 --> 1:24:29.231
WE JUST ONLY HAD A FEW MINS
EARLIER AND I JUST WANT TOK

1:24:29.231 --> 1:24:31.099

1:24:31.099 --> 1:24:33.268
>> CAN WE COLOR FOR A FEW E
MINUTES AND THEN I'LL PASSM

1:24:33.268 --> 1:24:33.602
ALONG TO YOU?

1:24:33.602 --> 1:24:35.470
>> I'M SORRY.
I JUST REALLY THINK WE NEEO

1:24:35.470 --> 1:24:36.138
FINISH OUR CONVERSATION.

1:24:36.138 --> 1:24:37.739
>> OKAY.

1:24:37.739 --> 1:24:40.742

>> SURE.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO INTERRUPTR

1:24:52.187 --> 1:24:53.355
COLORING BUT I THINK OUR
CONVERSATION MIGHT BE A LIE

1:24:53.355 --> 1:24:53.855
MORE IMPORTANT.

1:24:53.855 --> 1:24:54.189
>> ALL RIGHT.

1:24:54.189 --> 1:24:56.224
>> SERIOUSLY?

1:24:56.224 --> 1:24:59.928
>> I THINK CATHERINE IS BEG
VERY DISRESPECTFUL TO EVERE

1:24:59.928 --> 1:25:02.164
IN THE HOUSE RIGHT NOW BECE
EVERYONE IS TRYING TO HAVER

1:25:02.164 --> 1:25:05.000
FIRST IMPRESSION WITH HIM, A
LOT OF PEOPLE HAVEN'T TALKO

1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:07.135
HIM AT ALL, AND SO I FEEL E
CATHERINE DESERVES A TASTEF

1:25:07.135 --> 1:25:08.470
HER OWN MEDICINE.

1:25:08.470 --> 1:25:10.739

1:25:19.615 --> 1:25:20.849
>> OH, MY GOSH.

1:25:20.849 --> 1:25:21.817
>> DID SHE SAY [BLEEP]?

1:25:21.817 --> 1:25:23.585
>> I THINK SHE SAID IT.

1:25:23.585 --> 1:25:25.554
>> HOPEFULLY WE'LL HAVE SOE
MORE TIME LATER.

1:25:25.554 --> 1:25:31.059

>> IDEALLY, IN THE OCEAN,
LOOKING AT A BEAUTIFUL REES

1:25:37.733 --> 1:25:41.103
PROBABLY WHY I WOULD BE
WEARING A SNORKEL.

1:25:41.103 --> 1:25:42.938
OTHER THAN THAT, I PROBABLY
WOULDN'T PUT A SNORKEL ON.

1:25:42.938 --> 1:25:45.073
I THINK IT WAS JUST A LITTE
TACKY.

1:25:45.073 --> 1:25:46.441

>> ALL RIGHT, SOUNDS GOOD.

1:25:59.454 --> 1:26:01.957
>> I DON'T KNOW IF SHE WAS
TRYING TO INTIMIDATE ME ORF

1:26:01.957 --> 1:26:04.860
SHE WAS TRYING TO GET ME OY

AND THEN CATHERINE CUT IN.

1:26:39.861 --> 1:26:41.063
>> SHE STOLE HIM AGAIN?

1:26:41.063 --> 1:26:41.428
>> AGAIN?

1:26:41.428 --> 1:26:42.731
>> HE WAS LIKE, "THIRD TIMA
CHARM."

1:26:42.731 --> 1:26:44.599
>> HE SAID THAT?

1:26:44.599 --> 1:26:44.933
>> OH, MY GOD.

1:26:44.933 --> 1:26:46.768

ALL, LIKE, "WAIT, WHAT?"

1:26:48.303 --> 1:26:51.106
>> I WOULD NOT FEEL COMFORE
STEALING HIM FOR A SECOND E

1:26:51.106 --> 1:26:54.810
RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE I HAVE
RESPECT FOR THE OTHER GIRLT

1:26:54.810 --> 1:26:55.911
HAVEN'T TALKED TO HIM YET.

1:26:55.911 --> 1:26:58.747
>> IT DISADVANTAGES EVERYOE
ELSE THAT IS HERE.

1:26:58.747 --> 1:27:00.549
>> NO ONE RIGHT NOW IS HAPY
WITH CATHERINE'S AGGRESSIVS

1:27:00.549 --> 1:27:01.883
BECAUSE A LOT OF GIRLS STIL
HAVEN'T GOTTEN THEIR TIME H

1:27:01.883 --> 1:27:02.651
HIM YET.

1:27:02.651 --> 1:27:05.487
>> HI.

1:27:05.487 --> 1:27:09.124

WHAT CATHERINE IS DOING.

1:27:09.124 --> 1:27:12.127
LIKE, HONESTLY, LIKE, GIRL,
STOP WITH THIS [BLEEP].

1:27:12.127 --> 1:27:14.162

1:27:15.897 --> 1:27:17.799
>> OH, MY GOD, THE DRAMA

1:27:17.799 --> 1:27:20.068
>> JUST WANT TO, LIKE, GETE
FRESH AIR AND CHAT A LITTL.

1:27:20.068 --> 1:27:21.670
>> WAIT, THOSE TWO ARE TAL?

1:27:21.670 --> 1:27:23.171
>> DO YOU THINK THAT THEY'E
HAVING A CONFRONTATION?

1:27:23.171 --> 1:27:24.506
>> I ABSOLUTELY DO.

1:27:24.506 --> 1:27:27.476
>> [BLEEP].
IT'S GETTING REAL.

1:27:27.476 --> 1:27:30.445
>> HOW DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOR
TIME WITH COLTON WAS?

1:27:30.445 --> 1:27:31.413
>> TOO SHORT.

1:27:31.413 --> 1:27:34.449
>> YEAH.

1:27:34.449 --> 1:27:34.815
>> YEAH.

1:27:34.815 --> 1:27:38.720
>> SO I'M KIND OF CATCHINGD
FROM OTHER GIRLS, AND JUST

1:27:38.720 --> 1:27:43.091
BECAUSE YOU HAVE STOLEN CON
THREE TIMES ALREADY, IT'S

1:27:43.091 --> 1:27:45.894
DEFINITELY RUBBING PEOPLE E
WRONG WAY.

1:27:45.894 --> 1:27:49.197
I THINK IT IS ALMOST A LITE
DESPERATE AND I DON'T KNOWF

1:27:49.197 --> 1:27:52.167
YOU HAVEN'T HAD, LIKE, GOOD
CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM, BUI

1:27:52.167 --> 1:27:55.003
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT U
LET OTHER GIRLS TAKE TIME H HIM.

1:27:55.003 --> 1:27:57.005
>> I'M SORRY IF I STEPPED N
THEIR TOES AND I'M SORRY II

1:27:57.005 --> 1:28:01.376
INSULTED ANYONE OR WAS TOO
AGGRESSIVE OR I LOOKED

1:28:01.376 --> 1:28:03.912
"DESPERATE," WHICH IS HILA,
BY THE WAY.

1:28:03.912 --> 1:28:06.381
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
HE'S MY PRIORITY.

1:28:06.381 --> 1:28:08.717
>> COLTON IS EVERYONE'S
PRIORITY.

1:28:08.717 --> 1:28:11.119
I'M JUST SAYING, LIKE, REST
EVERYONE.

1:28:11.119 --> 1:28:16.424
>> I DON'T THINK THAT I HAE
DISRESPECTED ANYBODY.

1:28:16.424 --> 1:28:18.126
MY TIME WITH HIM WAS VERY .
I SPOKE WITH HIM PROBABLY 0

1:28:18.126 --> 1:28:19.327
SECONDS THE FIRST TIME, MA,
LIKE ‐‐

1:28:19.327 --> 1:28:20.529
>> IT WASN'T 30 SECONDS.

1:28:20.529 --> 1:28:23.565
>> I KNOW YOU THINK IT WAS
LONGER BUT IT REALLY WASN'T

1:28:23.565 --> 1:28:24.800
LONGER THAN, LIKE, 30 SECOR
A MINUTE.

1:28:24.800 --> 1:28:25.534
>> OKAY.

1:28:25.534 --> 1:28:26.268
[LAUGHS]

1:28:26.268 --> 1:28:27.569
>> DON'T LAUGH LIKE THAT.

1:28:27.569 --> 1:28:31.173
>> NO, I MEAN, I KNOW I TOK
HIM FROM YOU AND I WAITED A

1:28:31.173 --> 1:28:33.441
LONG TIME TO MAKE SURE YOU,
LIKE, PLENTY OF TIME TO TAO

1:28:33.441 --> 1:28:35.811
HIM BEFORE I WENT AND STOL.

1:28:35.811 --> 1:28:37.979
>> I DON'T WANT TO ARGUE WH
YOU. I AM, LIKE, THE LEAST

1:28:37.979 --> 1:28:38.880
ARGUMENTATIVE PERSON.

1:28:38.880 --> 1:28:39.815
>> YEAH, NO, DEFINITELY.

1:28:39.815 --> 1:28:42.784
>> I DO NOT WANT ANY BAD BD
AT ALL.

1:28:42.784 --> 1:28:44.753
>> YOU DON'T WANT BAD BLOOO
HONESTLY, I AM LOOKING OUTR

1:28:44.753 --> 1:28:46.354
YOU AT THIS POINT.

1:28:46.354 --> 1:28:50.058
>> I GET THAT, THAT IS WHYI
UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE ARET

1:28:50.058 --> 1:28:52.227
THAT I TALKED TO HIM A COUF
TIMES AND SOME PEOPLE HAVE.

1:28:52.227 --> 1:28:56.431

1:29:04.406 --> 1:29:06.541
PEOPLE FEEL.

1:29:06.541 --> 1:29:08.476
>> IF YOU DON'T HAVE HATER,
YOU'RE NOT DOING SOMETHING RIGHT.

1:29:08.476 --> 1:29:09.377
>> YEAH. HATERS.

1:29:09.377 --> 1:29:10.412

1:29:13.381 --> 1:29:15.116
>> THAT WAS A GOOD CHAT.

1:29:15.116 --> 1:29:17.819
>> EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS A LE

STEALING COLTON AGAIN.
