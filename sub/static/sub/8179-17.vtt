01:18.927 --> 01:19.944
I'VE EATEN WON TON SOUP

01:20.012 --> 01:22.713
DRIVING THROUGH SAN FRANCISCO
ON A MOTORCYCLE.

01:22.781 --> 01:25.483
I THINK I CAN HANDLE
A COUPLE FLAPJACKS.

01:26.785 --> 01:28.886
COULD YOU GET THE DOOR?

01:31.924 --> 01:33.291
THANK YOU.

01:37.997 --> 01:39.230
DARLING,

01:39.298 --> 01:41.399
I WAS WONDERING WHAT
ARRANGEMENTS YOU'VE MADE

01:41.466 --> 01:43.902
VIS-Ã -VIS YOUR
FINAL RESTING PLACE.

01:43.969 --> 01:46.437
NONE. I DON'T PLAN
ON CHECKING OUT JUST YET.

01:46.505 --> 01:48.673
AH. THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT MY BOYHOOD FRIEND

01:48.740 --> 01:49.975
FREDDY GIMPLE
USED TO SAY

01:50.042 --> 01:52.277
UNTIL SOMEONE SHOVED HIM
UNDER THE "L" TRAIN.

01:52.345 --> 01:54.679
BET THAT LEFT A MARK.

01:54.746 --> 01:55.664
OF COURSE
IT LEFT A MARK.

01:55.731 --> 01:58.549
HE WAS HIT BY
A LOCOMOTIVE.

01:58.617 --> 02:00.918
OK. WHAT'S
YOUR POINT HERE, DAD?

02:00.986 --> 02:02.621
MY POINT IS SHADY ACRES.

I HAVE A WONDERFUL
PLOT FOR SALE,

02:04.657 --> 02:08.092
AND I'D LIKE TO OFFER YOU
FIRST CRACK AT IT.

02:08.161 --> 02:10.628
I PURCHASED HIS-AND-HER PLOTS
FOR ME AND LILY,

02:10.696 --> 02:12.713
AND AFTER THE DIVORCE,
I GOT STUCK WITH THEM,

02:12.781 --> 02:14.833
<i>AND UNLESS THE PEOPLE

02:14.900 --> 02:16.734
FINALLY DECIDE TO BUY
ONE OF MY IDEAS,

02:16.802 --> 02:20.237
I CAN'T AFFORD BOTH.

02:20.305 --> 02:22.390
OK. WHEN I DIE, I WANT
TO BE BURIED NEXT TO DOUG.

02:22.458 --> 02:26.377

02:46.449 --> 02:48.316
I DON'T REALLY WANT

02:48.384 --> 02:49.484

02:49.552 --> 02:52.019

02:54.389 --> 02:56.307
NOT THAT THERE'S
ANYTHING WRONG

02:56.375 --> 02:58.643
WITH BEING A DOG WALKER.

02:58.711 --> 03:01.112

IT WASN'T YOUR LIFE DREAM,

03:01.180 --> 03:02.647

GREENLAND.
HOW WAS THAT?

05:41.139 --> 05:44.825

07:36.271 --> 07:39.290
SO, HOW ARE THINGS
AT THE FIRM?

07:39.357 --> 07:41.325
GREAT. GREAT.

07:41.393 --> 07:42.960
EVERYBODY MISSES YOU.

07:43.027 --> 07:44.462
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
KEEPING BUSY.

07:44.529 --> 07:46.013
YEAH. YOU KNOW, GETTING
FIRED WAS THE BEST THING

07:46.081 --> 07:48.182
THAT EVER HAPPENED

08:13.358 --> 08:15.559
SHOULD GET THESE GUYS HOME

08:15.627 --> 08:18.896
ENOUGH TIME TO STICK
MY HEAD IN THE OVEN, SO...

08:21.249 --> 08:22.617

5 DAYS IN A ROW,
THE GUY ANSWERS THE DOOR,

08:38.866 --> 08:41.168
NOTHING BUT A TOWEL.

08:41.236 --> 08:42.437
IT'S NOT LIKE HE'S EVEN
COMING OUT OF THE SHOWER.

08:42.504 --> 08:43.938
HE'S NOT EVEN WET.

08:44.005 --> 08:46.624
AND YOU'D RATHER
SEE HIM WET?

08:46.692 --> 08:48.392
I DON'T KNOW, OK?

HIT THE FLOOR AND...

08:52.898 --> 08:55.399
I'M IN AN ITALIAN DELI.

08:55.467 --> 08:57.368
WELL, I'M ACTUALLY

08:57.435 --> 08:59.420
WHEN I WAS 5-AHEM.

08:59.488 --> 09:01.889
I SAW MY GRANDMOTHER
NAKED ONCE.

09:01.957 --> 09:03.791
TO THIS DAY,
IT STILL HAUNTS ME.

09:03.858 --> 09:05.609

09:05.677 --> 09:08.245
NO. ME AND MY BROTHER HID IN HER CLOSET.

11:30.221 --> 11:34.025
AND YOU ARE
WONDERFUL.

11:34.092 --> 11:35.926
ARTHUR, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

11:35.994 --> 11:39.196
NOTHING. HE'S MY DRIVER.

11:39.264 --> 11:41.899
LET'S PUT A PIN IN THIS UNTIL
TOMORROW'S POTTERY CLASS.

11:41.967 --> 11:43.701
OK!

11:45.603 --> 11:47.638
YOU SOLD THAT PLOT
TO MY MOTHER!

11:47.706 --> 11:49.306
DEAL'S OFF.

11:49.374 --> 11:50.825
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

11:50.892 --> 11:54.528
BUT EVELYN WAS
MISS YONKERS 1957.

11:54.596 --> 11:56.480
I DON'T CARE.
THAT'S MY MOM'S PLOT.

11:56.548 --> 11:58.099
LOOK, I HAVE
A CHANCE TO WALK

11:58.166 --> 11:59.900
INTO THE PEARLY GATES
WITH A BOMBSHELL.

11:59.968 --> 12:01.768
JUST TELL YOUR MOTHER
SHE'LL HAVE TO WORK IT OUT.

12:01.836 --> 12:02.837
NO, ARTHUR, ALL RIGHT?

12:02.905 --> 12:04.972
BEING DEAD NEXT TO YOU
IS ALL SHE CAN TALK ABOUT.

12:05.040 --> 12:07.441
SHE'S AT THE CEMETERY NOW
CHECKING IT OUT.

12:07.509 --> 12:11.378
IF YOU'RE GONNA CRUSH
HER DREAM, DO IT YOURSELF.

12:15.016 --> 12:17.685
YOU SEE THAT BUILDING
OVER THERE?

12:17.752 --> 12:19.587
ACROSS THE RIVER?

12:19.654 --> 12:22.139
THAT'S THE BUILDING
WHERE I USED TO WORK.

12:22.206 --> 12:24.141
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

12:26.444 --> 12:28.311
AND NOT ONCE
IN ALL MY TIME THERE

12:28.379 --> 12:32.115
DID ANYBODY EVER THROW UP
AND TRY TO EAT IT.

12:33.284 --> 12:36.020
WOW. HOW'D YOU GET
SO MANY DOGS?

12:36.088 --> 12:38.773
OH, THEY'RE NOT MINE.
I'M JUST WALKING THEM.

12:38.841 --> 12:41.191
I WISH I HAD ONE, BUT
MY MOM WON'T LET ME.

12:41.259 --> 12:43.444
YOU LIKE DOGS, DO YOU?

12:43.511 --> 12:44.495
YEAH.

12:45.830 --> 12:49.299
WELL, YOU KNOW, UH,
I JUST MIGHT BE WILLING

12:49.367 --> 12:50.868
TO LET YOU WALK MINE.

12:50.936 --> 12:52.803
REALLY?
YEAH.

12:52.871 --> 12:54.421
AND NOT JUST ONCE.
HOW ABOUT EVERY MONDAY,

12:54.490 --> 12:56.657
WEDNESDAY, AND FRIDAY?
HOW'S THAT SOUND?

12:56.725 --> 12:59.059
WELL, I DO HAVE
HEBREW SCHOOL.

12:59.127 --> 13:00.344
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN. IF YOU'RE
NOT SERIOUS ABOUT THIS,

13:00.412 --> 13:02.012
I CAN FIND SOMEBODY
WHO IS, OK?

13:02.080 --> 13:03.981
NO, NO, NO, NO!
I'LL DO IT.

13:04.048 --> 13:05.515
ALL RIGHT.

13:05.583 --> 13:08.085
WELL, IF ALL GOES WELL
AND YOU MEET ME BACK HERE

13:08.120 --> 13:11.105
IN 2 HOURS SHARP,
I WILL GIVE YOU...

13:11.172 --> 13:13.707
A DOLLAR!

13:13.775 --> 13:14.858
THANKS.
YEAH.

13:14.926 --> 13:16.827
I WOULD'VE
DONE IT FOR FREE.

13:16.895 --> 13:19.162
DAMN IT.

13:19.230 --> 13:20.447
ALL RIGHT,
WELL, HERE YOU GO.

13:20.515 --> 13:22.316
HERE'S THE POOP BAGS
RIGHT THERE,

13:22.384 --> 13:24.785
AND THEN THERE'S
THEIR TREATS,

13:24.852 --> 13:27.588
AND ONE OF THEM GETS THE
PILL. I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE,

13:27.656 --> 13:28.855
BUT I'VE JUST BEEN
GIVING IT TO THAT ONE.

13:28.923 --> 13:30.924
HE SEEMS TO LIKE IT.
ALL RIGHT, THERE YOU GO.

13:30.992 --> 13:33.026
NOW GET ON OUT OF HERE.
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

13:33.094 --> 13:34.295
WE'LL SEE YOU
IN A LITTLE BIT.

13:34.362 --> 13:36.297
BYE-BYE! SCOOT, SCOOT!

13:47.508 --> 13:49.360
HEY,
WHAT'S UP, PLAYER?

13:49.427 --> 13:51.913
YEAH,
HOW'S IT GOING?

13:51.980 --> 13:54.549
YOU GOT ANY CHANGE? 'CAUSE
I'M A LITTLE SHORT HERE.

13:54.616 --> 13:57.317
YOU GOT CHANGE?

13:57.385 --> 13:59.637
VERY FUNNY, GUYS.
VERY MATURE, YEAH.

14:03.257 --> 14:07.795
UH, MR. O'BOYLE, I REALLY
NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

14:07.862 --> 14:10.364
YEAH, OK, WELL, YOU KNOW,
I'LL JUST TELL CORPORATE

14:10.431 --> 14:11.632
THAT I COULDN'T GET
THE QUARTERLIES DONE

14:11.699 --> 14:14.601
BECAUSE HEFFERNAN REALLY
NEEDED TO TALK TO ME.

14:14.669 --> 14:16.036
WHAT?

14:16.104 --> 14:18.105
I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF THERE'S ANY WAY

14:18.172 --> 14:22.275
I COULD STOP DELIVERY
TO 1616 MERIDIAN STREET.

14:22.343 --> 14:23.494
WHY IS THAT?

14:23.562 --> 14:25.396
WELL, THE GUY
WHO LIVES THERE,

14:25.463 --> 14:28.165
HE ALWAYS ANSWERS
THE DOOR IN A TOWEL.

14:28.233 --> 14:29.683
OH, FOR GOD SAKES!

14:29.751 --> 14:32.620
HEFFERNAN,
IT'S CALLED A TURBAN.

14:32.687 --> 14:35.288
YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING
FROM SENSITIVITY TRAINING?

14:35.356 --> 14:37.524
NO, NO, NO. THE TOWEL'S
AROUND HIS WAIST.

14:37.592 --> 14:38.892
OH. SO?

14:38.960 --> 14:42.062
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S JUST-IT'S WEIRD.

14:42.130 --> 14:44.148
OH. OK, SO YOU DON'T
WANT TO DELIVER

14:44.216 --> 14:46.450
TO WEIRD PEOPLE
ANYMORE, HUH?

14:46.518 --> 14:48.369
WELL, YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
JUST MAKE UP A LIST OF PEOPLE

14:48.437 --> 14:50.221
THAT YOU'D BE WILLING
TO DELIVER TO,

14:50.288 --> 14:52.423
AND THEN I CAN WORK
AROUND YOU. HOW ABOUT THIS?

14:52.491 --> 14:55.792
JUST SUPERMODELS
AND BAKERIES.

14:55.860 --> 14:57.561
I'M NOT ASKING THAT.
I MEAN, I WOULDN'T

14:57.629 --> 14:58.762
FIGHT YOU ON IT,
EITHER-

14:58.830 --> 15:00.531
HEFFERNAN, I CAN'T
HELP YOU OUT HERE.

15:00.598 --> 15:02.249
I MEAN, IF THE GUY HAD
A VICIOUS DOG OR SOMETHING,

15:02.317 --> 15:03.851
THEN MAYBE I COULD DO
SOMETHING FOR YOU.

15:03.919 --> 15:06.220
YOU KNOW, HE DOES-
HE DOES HAVE A DOG.

15:06.288 --> 15:07.938
IS HE VICIOUS?

15:08.006 --> 15:09.640
YEAH.

15:09.708 --> 15:12.276
OK. WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST SAY SO, THEN?

15:12.344 --> 15:14.611
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO MAKING UP
STORIES ABOUT A GUY IN A TOWEL.

15:14.679 --> 15:16.780
FILL OUT THIS 10-17, YOU
DON'T HAVE TO GO THERE ANYMORE.

15:16.848 --> 15:19.416
GREAT. WELL, THANKS
A LOT, MR. O'BOYLE.

15:26.774 --> 15:28.742
NO, NO, NO.
NO, NO, NO!

15:28.810 --> 15:31.745
YOU'RE NEW HERE.
YOU HAVEN'T EARNED THAT!

15:35.583 --> 15:37.801
VERONICA, THERE YOU ARE.

15:37.868 --> 15:40.704
OH, ARTHUR, HI!

15:40.772 --> 15:43.624
IT'S SO LOVELY HERE.

15:43.692 --> 15:45.692
WHAT A PLACE TO DIE.

15:45.760 --> 15:47.862
WHAT CEMETERY
ARE YOU AT?

15:47.929 --> 15:50.898
THE GRASS HASN'T BEEN MOWED.
THERE'S POOR DRAINAGE.

15:50.966 --> 15:52.950
I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO
GIVE YOU A FULL REFUND.

15:53.017 --> 15:55.769
OH, DON'T BE RIDICULOUS! I LOVE IT HERE.

15:55.837 --> 15:56.787
YOU'LL LOVE IT
TILL IT RAINS

15:56.855 --> 15:59.123
AND YOU'RE FLOATING
DOWN THE EXPRESSWAY.

15:59.190 --> 16:01.625
OH, STOP!

16:01.692 --> 16:03.276
LOOK, YOU CAN'T
HAVE THE PLOT.

16:03.344 --> 16:04.545
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

16:04.612 --> 16:05.946
I MET SOMEONE ELSE.

16:06.013 --> 16:07.731
WHO?
EVELYN ROSS.

16:07.799 --> 16:11.885
YOU MAY KNOW HER
AS MISS YONKERS 1957.

16:11.953 --> 16:13.971
I DON'T
BELIEVE THIS.

16:14.038 --> 16:15.272
I ALREADY PAID YOU.

16:15.340 --> 16:17.775
AND HERE'S
YOUR MONEY BACK.

16:19.644 --> 16:20.978
WHERE'S THE REST?

16:21.045 --> 16:21.879
YOU'LL GET IT
WHEN I RETURN

16:21.947 --> 16:24.265
A NOW SLIGHTLY USED
MUSTACHE GROOMER

16:24.332 --> 16:26.100
TO HAMMACHER-SCHLEMMER.

16:26.168 --> 16:28.519
OH, RIGHT. THAT SOUNDS LIKE
ANOTHER ONE OF YOUR LIES,

16:28.586 --> 16:30.754
LIKE WHEN YOU SAID
YOU WERE IN GREENLAND.

16:30.821 --> 16:31.588
I WAS IN GREENLAND!

16:31.656 --> 16:33.440
I SAW YOU
IN WALDBAUM'S!

16:33.508 --> 16:35.108
I HAD 2 DAYS OFF!

16:35.176 --> 16:36.993
YOU KNOW...

16:37.061 --> 16:38.895
I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU HATE ME.

16:38.963 --> 16:40.730
WHAT I DON'T GET IS
THAT WHEN YOU'RE DEAD,

16:40.798 --> 16:43.200
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT
MAKE WHO YOU'RE NEXT TO?

16:43.268 --> 16:46.854
OPEN YOUR EARS!
SHE'S MISS YONKERS!

16:49.607 --> 16:51.341
VERONICA.

16:53.178 --> 16:55.512
YOU'LL FIND
ANOTHER PLOT, I KNOW.

16:55.580 --> 16:57.197
WHAT DO YOU CARE, ANYWAY?

16:57.265 --> 16:59.183
I CARE VERY DEEPLY.

17:01.952 --> 17:04.387
HERE'S ONE.
BEAUTIFUL SPOT.

17:04.455 --> 17:06.523
RIGHT TO NEXT TO
BILL JOHNSON.

17:06.590 --> 17:08.476
HUH?

17:08.542 --> 17:12.311
BILL JOHNSON? I KNEW
A BILL JOHNSON YEARS AGO.

17:12.380 --> 17:14.531
I WONDER IF IT'S
THE SAME ONE?

17:14.598 --> 17:15.549
OF COURSE
IT'S THE SAME ONE.

17:15.616 --> 17:17.684
HOW MANY BILL JOHNSONS
COULD THERE BE?

17:17.752 --> 17:19.969
OH! YOU KNOW,
WAY BACK WHEN,

17:20.037 --> 17:23.138
BILL AND I ACTUALLY HAD A
LITTLE THING FOR EACH OTHER,

17:23.208 --> 17:26.510
BUT WE WERE BOTH
TOO SHY TO ACT ON IT.

17:26.578 --> 17:28.745
WELL, BETTER LATE
THAN NEVER.

17:28.813 --> 17:30.481
I SAY WE GO
TO THE OFFICE

17:30.549 --> 17:31.682
AND SEE
WHAT WE CAN DO

17:31.749 --> 17:34.652
TO GET YOU
IN THIS GRAVE TODAY.

17:38.890 --> 17:40.357
CARRIE?

17:40.425 --> 17:42.042
OH.

17:42.110 --> 17:43.110
HEY, HOL. WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

17:43.178 --> 17:44.145
DON'T YOU USUALLY
WALK YOUR DOGS

17:44.212 --> 17:46.313
AT THE PARK
ON HILLSIDE?

17:46.381 --> 17:48.348
I DO, BUT THEY FOUND
A BODY THERE,

17:48.416 --> 17:52.019
SO WE THOUGHT WE'D TRY SOMETHING
NEW. WHERE ARE YOUR DOGS?

17:52.086 --> 17:54.788
UH, OH!

17:54.856 --> 17:58.425
THEY WERE HERE
A MINUTE AGO.

17:58.492 --> 17:59.927
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS!

17:59.994 --> 18:02.712
I'M GONNA COUNT TO 10!
THIS ISN'T FUNNY!

18:02.780 --> 18:04.648
THEY'RE ONLY MESSING WITH
ME 'CAUSE YOU'RE HERE.

18:04.715 --> 18:07.617
SPEAKING OF YOU, YOU LOOK
GREAT. IS THAT TAN REAL?

18:08.986 --> 18:10.604
HI, MRS. HEFFERNAN.

18:10.671 --> 18:13.256
HEY! WHAT ARE YOU
DOING WITH MY DOGS?

18:13.324 --> 18:16.009
WALKING THEM.
YOU PAID ME TO.

18:16.077 --> 18:18.862
TSK! NO ONE LIKES
A LIAR, SON.

18:18.930 --> 18:20.664
SHOULDN'T YOU BE
IN HEBREW SCHOOL?

18:20.732 --> 18:21.899
OK, CARRIE, WHAT IS
GOING ON HERE?

18:21.967 --> 18:23.000
THAT'S WHAT
I'D LIKE TO KNOW.

18:23.068 --> 18:24.001
CARRIE!

18:24.069 --> 18:26.153
ALL-YEAH, ALL RIGHT,
YOU WANT TO KNOW

18:26.188 --> 18:28.238
WHAT'S GOING ON?
I HATE THIS, OK?

18:28.306 --> 18:29.373
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON!

18:29.441 --> 18:32.376
I HATE DOGS. I HATE POOP.
I HATE OUTSIDE.

18:32.444 --> 18:35.029
SO YOU'RE PAWNING THEM
OFF ON A 9-YEAR-OLD?

18:35.096 --> 18:37.831
LOOK, HE IS BETTER
AT THIS THAN I AM.

18:37.899 --> 18:39.433
I MEAN, HE WALKS THEM
AND WASHES THEM,

18:39.501 --> 18:42.669
AND HE DOES IT ALL
FOR A DOLLAR A DAY.

18:42.737 --> 18:44.271
A DOLLAR A DAY?

18:44.339 --> 18:45.472
MM-HMM!

19:07.095 --> 19:08.929
LOOK, IT'S MY JOB,
PAL, ALL RIGHT?

19:08.997 --> 19:10.897
PLEASE! PLEASE!
I'LL GIVE YOU A DOLL!

19:10.965 --> 19:12.933
I'M JUST TRYING TO DO
MY JOB HERE, ALL RIGHT?

19:13.000 --> 19:14.568
YOU CAN'T TAKE MY DOG!

19:14.635 --> 19:17.737
THIS IS SO UNFAIR!
YOU CANNOT TAKE MY DOG!

19:17.805 --> 19:19.356
I'M SORRY, SIR.
NO, PLEASE!

19:19.423 --> 19:20.791
WHAT'S GOING ON?

19:20.859 --> 19:22.826
DOUG, THEY'RE TRYING TO
TAKE MR. BELVEDERE AWAY!

19:22.894 --> 19:24.628
SOMEONE FILED A COMPLAINT.
THEY SAID HE BIT SOMEONE.

19:24.696 --> 19:26.647
THEY'RE GONNA
PUT HIM TO SLEEP!

19:26.715 --> 19:28.465
THIS GUY WOULDN'T
DO THAT, WOULD YOU?

19:28.533 --> 19:31.251
ME? NO.
THAT'S BRUCE'S JOB.

19:32.753 --> 19:34.855
THIS IS-THIS IS CRAZY.

19:34.922 --> 19:36.790
MR. BELVEDERE
ISN'T VICIOUS.

19:36.858 --> 19:38.626
HE'S A SWEETHEART.

19:38.693 --> 19:40.961
AREN'T YOU, MR. BELVEDERE? AREN'T YOU-

19:41.028 --> 19:43.647
OH, GOD!
IS HE BITING YOU?

19:43.715 --> 19:46.800
OH, NO. WE'RE JUST PLAYING
A LITTLE GAME OF CLAMPSY.

19:46.867 --> 19:49.269
OH, JEEZ, HE'S GOING
FOR THE HIGH SCORE NOW.

19:49.337 --> 19:51.939
LOOK AT THAT!
ALL RIGHT!

19:54.242 --> 19:55.542
YOU WANT-
YOU WANT TO TRY?

19:55.610 --> 19:57.311
NO, NO, THANK YOU.

19:57.378 --> 19:59.112
OK! REMATCH LATER.

19:59.180 --> 20:02.916
LOOK, SOMEONE REPORTED
HIM. I GOTTA DO THIS.

20:02.984 --> 20:04.668
OH!

20:04.736 --> 20:07.003
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
IT WAS ME, ALL RIGHT.

20:07.071 --> 20:08.021
WHAT?

20:08.089 --> 20:09.823
I PUT IN
THE COMPLAINT.

20:09.890 --> 20:13.127
BUT WHY? HE'S BEEN
NOTHING BUT GOOD TO YOU.

20:13.194 --> 20:15.562
HE DANCED FOR YOU!
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

20:15.630 --> 20:17.331
BECAUSE YOU COME
TO THE DOOR IN A TOWEL!

20:17.398 --> 20:19.666
SO YOU KILL MY DOG?!

20:19.733 --> 20:21.802
NOT ME. BRUCE.

20:21.869 --> 20:23.170
LOOK, YOU GOTTA
LET THE DOG GO.

20:23.237 --> 20:25.972
ALL RIGHT? I OFFICIALLY
WITHDRAW MY COMPLAINT.

20:26.040 --> 20:29.593
OK. AND THE NEXT TIME YOU
TWO HAVE A LOVERS' SPAT,

20:29.660 --> 20:32.629
LEAVE ANIMAL CONTROL
OUT OF IT.

20:32.697 --> 20:35.915
IT'S OK, MR. BELVEDERE. I
KNOW YOU DIDN'T BITE ANYBODY.

20:35.983 --> 20:38.718
ACTUALLY, HE DID. HE BIT
ME PRETTY GOOD JUST NOW.

20:38.786 --> 20:42.289
OH, MY GOD!
YOU'RE BLEEDING.

20:42.357 --> 20:44.007
HERE, TAKE MY TOWEL.

20:44.158 --> 20:46.026
OH!

20:50.648 --> 20:53.833
EVELYN, I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I THOUGHT WE HAD A DEAL.

20:53.901 --> 20:55.218
WELL, ARTHUR,
IT'S JUST THAT, UM,

20:55.286 --> 20:57.554
WELL, I'VE MET
SOMEONE ELSE.

20:57.622 --> 21:02.592
AND I THINK I WOULD PREFER
TO BE BURIED WITH HIM.

21:02.660 --> 21:05.946
