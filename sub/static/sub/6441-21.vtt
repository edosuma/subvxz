00:01.635 --> 00:06.072
Now, I'm gonna knock on the other wall.
When you hear me, you knock on this wall.

00:06.507 --> 00:09.965
What is she, crazy? Hey, get that candle
and get your butt out of there!

00:10.144 --> 00:14.478
- I don't think she can hear you, Pete.
- Guys, hit the mute button, okay?

00:31.399 --> 00:34.129
Lance! Oh, Lance!

00:34.301 --> 00:36.064
Oh, I saw it again!

00:59.660 --> 01:01.150
Hello?

01:05.331 --> 01:06.924
Who's there?

01:27.455 --> 01:30.083
- Would you like some tea?
- Yes, please.

01:30.257 --> 01:34.250
- I've got an elephant. What do you have?
- Rhinoceros.

01:34.962 --> 01:37.294
Would you like an apple?

01:38.232 --> 01:39.995
Good.

01:40.534 --> 01:44.766
Lana? I got a hippopotamus.

01:45.673 --> 01:47.868
You're so big.

01:55.716 --> 01:57.274
Why are you scared?

02:02.523 --> 02:04.491
Do you want to play with me?

02:11.198 --> 02:13.462
Lana, what's going on?

02:18.973 --> 02:21.066
I thought I...

02:21.542 --> 02:23.874
I guess... The lights went out, and...

02:24.044 --> 02:26.376
I guess the movie creeped me out.
I thought I saw...

02:26.547 --> 02:27.844
Thought you saw what?

02:29.783 --> 02:32.650
- Nothing.
- Let's get out of the dark.

02:40.161 --> 02:44.257
You sure you're okay?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

03:55.069 --> 03:57.697
That's my favorite dress.

03:58.806 --> 04:01.331
You're... You're not real.

04:01.508 --> 04:05.604
- I am too real.
- No, you died.

04:06.714 --> 04:09.911
Lana? Chloe's dad said you were up here.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.656
Lana, what is it?

04:23.864 --> 04:25.331
Clark.

04:28.168 --> 04:30.728
It sounds so ridiculous.

04:31.272 --> 04:33.399
You can tell me anything, Lana.
You know that.

04:35.276 --> 04:38.803
Clark, do you believe in ghosts?

04:43.183 --> 04:47.051
We used to come out here all the time.
We'd make little boats...

04:47.221 --> 04:49.951
...out of flowers
and float them downstream.

04:50.124 --> 04:52.957
They always sunk
before they got around the bend.

04:54.928 --> 04:57.226
Is this where she drowned?

04:59.500 --> 05:01.593
It was raining...

05:02.236 --> 05:04.966
...and the bridge was slippery.

05:05.139 --> 05:07.403
The next thing I knew...

05:10.778 --> 05:12.405
It's okay.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.417
Okay.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.989
Funny thing is...

05:38.339 --> 05:41.069
...she'd insist it was my mom
trying to talk to me.

05:45.412 --> 05:48.870
As much as I wanted to believe her,
I always knew it was make-believe.

05:51.618 --> 05:55.884
Maybe this is her way of showing me that
the dead really can communicate with us.

05:58.459 --> 06:02.862
If she is a ghost, why do you think
she waited so long to contact you?

06:03.430 --> 06:05.159
I don't know.

06:08.702 --> 06:12.138
There's just gotta be
a rational explanation for this girl.

06:13.207 --> 06:17.701
- Have you kept in contact with her parents?
- No, they split up after the accident.

06:18.979 --> 06:22.039
I don't know where her mom is,
but her dad moved to Grandville.

06:25.018 --> 06:27.543
Maybe you're not the only one
who's seen her.

06:35.562 --> 06:38.895
Didn't you see
the "No Trespassing" signs?

06:40.234 --> 06:43.032
Mr. Dinsmore, it's me, Lana Lang.

06:45.773 --> 06:49.607
Oh, well, look at you. All grown up.

06:52.846 --> 06:56.782
Mr. Dinsmore, this is...
This is going to sound strange...

06:57.184 --> 06:59.482
...but I think I saw Emily.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.979
What is this, some kind of sick joke?

07:02.956 --> 07:05.982
I don't mean to upset you. It's just...

07:06.160 --> 07:07.286
...I've seen her twice.

07:08.095 --> 07:11.929
We figured if anybody else had seen her,
it'd be you.

07:12.833 --> 07:15.301
Sure, I've seen her...

07:16.370 --> 07:18.838
Whenever I hear her favorite song...

07:19.006 --> 07:23.238
...or see a young girl jumping rope
in the park.

07:24.645 --> 07:27.239
Losing a child is something
a parent never gets over.

07:31.018 --> 07:32.883
Now, if you'll excuse me.

07:50.938 --> 07:55.705
Mr. Luthor, I would think quick
decision-making would be your forte.

07:55.876 --> 07:59.539
That's why I made the quick decision
to put Helen in charge of the wedding.

07:59.713 --> 08:05.174
Well, I don't see her here, and
we're three weeks away and counting.

08:06.787 --> 08:10.723
- Hello.
- I knew you had your vices, son...

08:10.891 --> 08:14.054
...but I didn't realize gluttony
was one of them.

08:15.662 --> 08:19.393
Oh, I suppose if there's anyone who's
an authority on the seven deadly sins...

08:19.566 --> 08:21.295
...it's you, Dad.

08:24.771 --> 08:26.671
Amaretto truffle.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.432
Could I have some water, please?

08:28.775 --> 08:32.802
The liqueur seems to be overpowering
the butter.

08:32.980 --> 08:34.311
Thank you.

08:34.481 --> 08:37.881
As much as I value
your epicurean input, Dad...

08:38.051 --> 08:40.019
...I'm curious, why are you in Smallville?

08:40.187 --> 08:43.645
I wanted to give you my gift in person...

08:43.823 --> 08:48.284
...since it's obvious by now that
I won't be receiving a wedding invitation.

08:48.996 --> 08:53.797
You offered the woman I love
$ 100,000 to leave me.

08:53.967 --> 08:55.457
I did you a favor, Lex.

08:56.470 --> 08:58.836
That was the ultimate test of loyalty.

08:59.006 --> 09:01.804
And she passed with flying colors.
You should be thanking me.

09:01.975 --> 09:06.378
Thanking you? Well, my thank-you note
must be lost in the mail...

09:06.547 --> 09:08.538
...along with your invitation.

09:08.715 --> 09:11.411
Go on, open it.

09:22.496 --> 09:27.126
- A Caribbean honeymoon.
- Your own private island.

09:29.002 --> 09:31.698
I'll throw in the LuthorCorp jet as well.

09:37.210 --> 09:38.700
Why?

09:40.981 --> 09:44.849
I just want you to be happy, Lex.

10:00.467 --> 10:05.302
Clark, when you turned in your press pass,
you relinquished your computer privileges.

10:05.472 --> 10:09.135
I don't mean to be hall monitor,
but it is school policy.

10:09.977 --> 10:12.445
- I'm trying to help Lana.
- Of course you are.

10:12.613 --> 10:14.547
What are you saving her from today?

10:14.715 --> 10:18.151
She's being haunted by a girl
who died six years ago.

10:18.652 --> 10:21.587
Okay, I'm piqued. Go on.

10:22.389 --> 10:24.289
She thinks it's a ghost.
I'm not so sure.

10:24.458 --> 10:27.154
It's not like people haven't
come back to life around here.

10:27.361 --> 10:31.559
Even though it goes against my natural
slant toward all things Wall of Weird...

10:31.732 --> 10:34.257
...I think there's another explanation
for this.

10:35.669 --> 10:37.466
Lana's been through a lot in her life.

10:37.638 --> 10:41.597
Maybe this haunting is a way she's dealing
with it through her subconscious.

10:41.775 --> 10:43.936
You think she's seeing things
that aren't there?

10:44.111 --> 10:46.272
No, I think to her they're very real.

10:46.847 --> 10:50.078
- She's not crazy.
- I wasn't saying she's crazy.

10:50.250 --> 10:53.708
All I'm saying is, there's a lot of things
about Lana that you don't know.

10:53.887 --> 10:57.983
I mean, you don't hear her crying
in her room at 3:00 in the morning.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.285
What you see is just a mask.

11:02.129 --> 11:05.064
- Why are you telling me this?
- Because she talks to you.

11:05.232 --> 11:08.395
Regardless of what's going on
between us, she's still my friend.

11:12.039 --> 11:13.597
Chloe.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.137
Thanks.

11:18.311 --> 11:20.211
Lock up when you're done.

11:36.997 --> 11:41.093
Sweetheart, I've been looking
all over for you.

11:41.768 --> 11:44.965
- Everything's different.
- What do you mean?

11:45.238 --> 11:47.172
Where are all the bunnies?

11:52.779 --> 11:55.612
Honey, we can talk about that
when we get home. Okay?

11:55.849 --> 11:57.976
This is our home, Daddy.

11:59.119 --> 12:02.646
No, not anymore, sweetheart.
Our home's in Grandville.

12:05.125 --> 12:07.525
I don't understand.

12:07.694 --> 12:09.491
Lana said I died.

12:11.431 --> 12:13.661
Lana doesn't know
what she's talking about.

12:13.834 --> 12:16.826
Yes, she does.
She's my best friend.

12:18.705 --> 12:20.172
Emily...

12:21.007 --> 12:23.100
...get in the car.

12:24.644 --> 12:26.271
No.

12:29.349 --> 12:33.285
I'm not going.
I don't want to be locked up anymore.

12:33.520 --> 12:37.684
I want to be a normal girl.
I want to play with Lana.

12:39.593 --> 12:41.151
You have to listen to me, Emily.

12:42.896 --> 12:45.990
You are never to see Lana Lang again.

12:46.166 --> 12:49.533
- Do you understand?
- You can't tell me what to do.

12:49.703 --> 12:52.001
I'll do whatever I want.

13:16.564 --> 13:21.160
Clark, couldn't the boneyard visit
have waited till after the rain stopped?

13:21.335 --> 13:24.168
It's the only way to disprove
the zombie theory.

13:24.338 --> 13:27.865
Yeah, well, if this Emily girl
really is a ghost...

13:28.042 --> 13:31.637
...I really don't think she'd appreciate
you scoping out her coffin.

13:34.915 --> 13:37.247
Pete, here it is.

13:41.689 --> 13:44.249
"Emily Eve Dinsmore.

13:44.425 --> 13:47.394
Loving child, blessed angel."

13:58.239 --> 14:00.469
The body hasn't been touched.

14:11.352 --> 14:13.650
Where did she go...?

14:33.908 --> 14:35.273
Clark?

15:06.807 --> 15:08.331
Let me in, Lana.

15:18.586 --> 15:21.054
I know why you're scared of me.

15:25.659 --> 15:27.854
I saw my grave.

15:29.997 --> 15:32.090
But I'm not dead, Lana.

15:33.867 --> 15:35.664
Who are you?

15:36.870 --> 15:39.464
I'm Emily, silly.

15:45.246 --> 15:49.615
- What do you want from me?
- My daddy said I can't see you anymore.

15:49.783 --> 15:52.013
Did you do something bad?

15:55.422 --> 15:56.980
Lana.

16:04.498 --> 16:06.159
She's here.

16:12.606 --> 16:13.937
Where?

16:15.843 --> 16:21.110
- I swear it, Clark, she was right here.
- Lana, it's okay, I believe you.

16:21.282 --> 16:24.877
Emily's not a ghost. I saw her.

16:25.486 --> 16:28.250
In the graveyard. It's where I found this.

16:33.927 --> 16:37.419
Her father gave it to her because
she wanted a necklace like mine.

16:39.400 --> 16:42.767
But it can't be Emily.
She couldn't still be 10 years old.

16:42.936 --> 16:44.198
I don't know who it is.

16:44.371 --> 16:47.966
But I think I know how she's able
to just appear out of nowhere.

16:49.777 --> 16:52.302
I think she moves faster
than we can see her.

16:52.946 --> 16:57.178
- How?
- I'm not sure, but... Hey...

16:57.351 --> 16:59.876
...at least we know you're not
losing your mind.

17:02.756 --> 17:04.416
Thanks, Clark.

17:16.203 --> 17:18.967
Back from Metropolis so soon?

17:20.007 --> 17:25.444
- Awfully long drive for quality health care.
- You tailing me, Lex? I hope not.

17:25.612 --> 17:28.273
- A bit obsessive, don't you think?
- I heard you were here.

17:28.482 --> 17:32.475
- I wanted to make sure you were okay.
- I came to visit a former employee.

17:32.653 --> 17:36.384
He's just been admitted.
Unfortunately, he's still unconscious.

17:36.557 --> 17:40.789
He must have been an exceptional worker
to merit a visit from the CEO.

17:40.961 --> 17:45.364
I like to think that I treat everyone
at LuthorCorp as part of the family.

17:45.532 --> 17:48.399
Oh, that would explain
their lack of loyalty.

17:51.171 --> 17:55.540
Have you become so cynical that you read
ill will into my good intentions?

17:55.709 --> 17:59.839
I'm just wondering why you're spending
so much time in Smallville lately, that's all.

18:02.116 --> 18:04.141
You may not believe me,
I'm sure you won't...

18:04.318 --> 18:07.378
...but I've always tried
to be a good father to you, son.

18:08.389 --> 18:13.850
I worry about you. Son, these obsessive,
paranoid tendencies...

18:14.027 --> 18:17.929
The danger with indulging them
is that you lose perspective.

18:18.098 --> 18:20.589
And you turn your back
on what truly matters.

18:28.275 --> 18:30.835
Lex? Coming?

19:07.781 --> 19:09.942
He's sleeping.

19:10.117 --> 19:12.483
I tried to wake him up.

19:12.653 --> 19:15.315
He needs to take care of me.

19:15.489 --> 19:17.150
I have nowhere to go.

19:21.995 --> 19:26.694
- What's your name?
- Emily. He's my daddy.

19:30.304 --> 19:33.740
I think our daddies are friends.
Mine was just in here.

19:34.975 --> 19:37.170
He's a bad man.

19:41.782 --> 19:46.185
- Did he do something to your daddy?
- He took the bunnies away.

19:47.688 --> 19:51.624
- What bunnies, Emily?
- The ones in the back yard.

19:55.262 --> 19:58.197
Maybe I should talk to your mommy.

19:58.665 --> 20:00.690
Is she here?

20:16.416 --> 20:18.384
Come on, stay close.

20:30.631 --> 20:32.724
You're my best friend.

20:35.202 --> 20:37.534
You're my best friend.

20:50.217 --> 20:52.378
You're my best friend.

21:13.740 --> 21:16.174
This must be what you saw
at the Talon.

21:21.481 --> 21:23.915
You're my best friend.

21:28.622 --> 21:30.783
You're my best friend.

21:32.893 --> 21:35.191
You're my best friend.

21:35.662 --> 21:39.098
Who needs human companionship when
you could have a Gabby Abby?

21:55.415 --> 21:57.576
I remember this.

21:58.952 --> 22:01.614
I gave it to Emily for her ninth birthday.

22:03.690 --> 22:08.684
Last entry's from the day before she died:
"I hope it doesn't rain tomorrow.

22:09.396 --> 22:14.356
Lana and I are going to the river.
We're going to be best friends forever."

22:53.640 --> 22:55.039
Lana.

24:04.144 --> 24:05.907
Oh, my God.

24:55.729 --> 24:59.665
- Clark, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

24:59.833 --> 25:02.063
Let's get out of here.

25:10.978 --> 25:13.003
You did the right thing, calling the police.

25:13.180 --> 25:17.776
- He was trying to clone his daughter?
- More than try. We think he succeeded.

25:17.952 --> 25:20.113
Whoever's funding him's
sure got a lot of money.

25:20.287 --> 25:22.949
Dinsmore even wanted her to have
the same memories as Emily.

25:23.390 --> 25:27.292
- That's why he gave her the diary.
- That little girl must be so confused.

25:29.363 --> 25:32.093
All she wanted was a friend,
and I just scared her away.

25:32.266 --> 25:35.394
- I have to go and find her.
- Lana, I don't think that's a good idea.

25:35.603 --> 25:40.131
Clark's right. Until we know more,
why don't you stay here?

25:50.451 --> 25:53.818
- Mrs. Kent, Mr. Kent.
- Hello, sheriff.

25:54.788 --> 25:57.279
- We followed up on your story.
- You found the lab.

25:57.625 --> 26:00.025
After we got your call,
we went and checked it out.

26:00.194 --> 26:02.788
David Copperfield must've got there first.

26:45.973 --> 26:47.497
I saw them.

26:48.342 --> 26:50.867
The people who took everything away?

26:52.112 --> 26:54.080
The sleeping girls.

26:54.448 --> 26:57.008
Why are they like me?

27:07.828 --> 27:10.888
- Emily...
- My daddy said I can't remember...

27:11.065 --> 27:13.659
...because I had an accident.

27:16.537 --> 27:20.029
You don't remember anything
because you didn't write that.

27:20.207 --> 27:22.368
A different Emily did.

27:23.877 --> 27:28.405
She's the girl buried in the graveyard,
isn't she?

27:31.151 --> 27:32.641
Yeah.

27:35.589 --> 27:37.921
This is her story.

27:38.325 --> 27:41.021
But you have to write your own.

27:43.664 --> 27:46.189
Why would my daddy lie to me?

27:50.104 --> 27:53.972
He probably thought that telling you
the truth would make you feel different.

27:56.110 --> 27:58.442
But there's nothing wrong
with being different.

27:58.612 --> 28:01.945
I'm different too.
It doesn't change who we are.

28:02.216 --> 28:04.207
Yes, it does.

28:11.925 --> 28:13.916
Lex, what are you doing here?

28:14.094 --> 28:15.721
I could ask the same of you.

28:18.232 --> 28:20.223
I met Emily Dinsmore.

28:21.268 --> 28:23.532
You can't blame me
for being a little intrigued...

28:23.704 --> 28:26.605
...after I found out she died six years ago.

28:27.341 --> 28:30.799
So you don't know anything
about the lab that was down here?

28:32.780 --> 28:36.511
They cloned Emily here. That's why
your father's been refining meteor rocks.

28:36.750 --> 28:38.308
- What?
- There were jars of it.

28:38.485 --> 28:40.578
Right where you're standing.

28:46.193 --> 28:50.527
Before Dinsmore left LuthorCorp,
he was developing a technique...

28:50.698 --> 28:52.723
...to speed up cell growth.

28:53.701 --> 28:57.967
He claimed he could incubate a rabbit
embryo to adulthood in a matter of days.

28:58.138 --> 29:01.232
He's been using the meteor rocks
as Miracle-Gro.

29:02.376 --> 29:05.004
That's why Emily looks like
she's 10 years old already.

29:05.946 --> 29:10.883
All ethics aside,
it's an astonishing accomplishment.

29:13.420 --> 29:16.548
Well, tell that to the little girl
who doesn't know who she is.

30:10.611 --> 30:12.806
I brought you a picture.

30:20.187 --> 30:21.552
Thanks.

30:24.258 --> 30:26.692
Emily, I want to talk to you.

30:27.461 --> 30:29.986
Are you ready to go to the river?

30:31.899 --> 30:33.764
Not today.

30:35.269 --> 30:39.501
- Don't you want to be my friend anymore?
- Of course I do, but...

30:39.673 --> 30:44.940
Come to the river. I'll race you.
I want everything to be like before.

30:47.781 --> 30:50.272
No! Emily, wait.

31:04.865 --> 31:07.356
You're here about Emily, aren't you?

31:09.369 --> 31:11.428
She's a remarkable girl.

31:11.605 --> 31:13.436
- Did he find her?
- Not yet.

31:13.607 --> 31:15.973
But, knowing my father, he will.

31:16.143 --> 31:19.112
You know that Emily
will never be safe in his care.

31:19.279 --> 31:23.079
- I don't have many options.
- I'm offering to protect her.

31:23.250 --> 31:27.653
You loved her enough to create her.
Don't you want her to have a normal life?

31:27.821 --> 31:32.155
Of course I do.
But Emily's accelerated growth caused...

31:32.326 --> 31:34.089
...severe chromosomal damage.

31:34.261 --> 31:38.129
She has no conscience,
she has no concept of right or wrong.

31:38.832 --> 31:41.096
She's dangerous.

31:51.879 --> 31:53.369
Lana?

31:55.549 --> 31:58.541
- Clark, what's wrong?
- Where's Lana?

31:58.719 --> 32:01.654
I thought she was in the living room
doing her homework.

32:23.043 --> 32:25.307
Emily, it's too slippery out here.

32:25.479 --> 32:29.245
- It's okay, Lana, we won't get in trouble.
- You don't understand.

32:29.416 --> 32:34.752
- We've already been out here once before.
- Is that why Daddy's mad at you?

32:40.727 --> 32:42.490
It was raining...

32:43.397 --> 32:46.594
...and I fell into the water
and you jumped in after me.

32:46.767 --> 32:50.965
- Because I'm your best friend?
- Yes.

32:51.872 --> 32:54.568
You kept swimming beside me,
telling me I could make it...

32:54.741 --> 32:56.470
...that I'd be fine.

32:56.643 --> 33:00.807
And when I looked back,
you were too far away...

33:00.981 --> 33:03.415
...and the current was too strong.

33:03.584 --> 33:05.916
Didn't you save me?

33:12.459 --> 33:13.790
No.

33:15.662 --> 33:18.756
I thought you were my best friend.

33:21.468 --> 33:25.632
If I could go back and change that day,
I swear to you, I would.

33:25.806 --> 33:28.900
I live every day knowing
that it should have been me.

33:34.214 --> 33:36.614
This time it will be.

34:22.728 --> 34:24.560
Lana.

34:25.331 --> 34:26.958
Lana.

34:36.677 --> 34:38.668
Oh, please.

34:42.049 --> 34:43.482
Lana.

34:44.618 --> 34:46.552
Lana, it's okay.

34:46.719 --> 34:48.984
It's okay, it's me. It's all right.
You're okay.

34:52.225 --> 34:55.319
Clark. Hold me.

35:10.678 --> 35:14.170
Lex, what's the crisis? One minute,
you want nothing to do with me...

35:14.348 --> 35:16.908
...and then I'm inundated
with urgent messages.

35:17.084 --> 35:19.814
How does it feel to play God, Dad?

35:19.987 --> 35:22.387
If I left in the middle of brunch
with the governor...

35:22.556 --> 35:25.616
I know you've reopened Level 3.

35:25.793 --> 35:27.317
The ominous Level 3.

35:27.495 --> 35:29.895
Instead of abandoning the project
like you claimed...

35:30.064 --> 35:32.931
...you dispersed the research
into smaller, undetectable labs.

35:33.100 --> 35:34.965
How could you buy in
to such a myth, Lex?

35:35.136 --> 35:38.162
Your connection to Dinsmore
is more than a myth.

35:38.339 --> 35:41.240
You're genetically
engineering human beings.

35:42.977 --> 35:45.810
Oh, Lex. Lex.

35:46.447 --> 35:49.507
Extraterrestrials. Secret labs.

35:49.817 --> 35:51.910
It's science fiction, son.

35:53.354 --> 35:56.983
I saw Emily Dinsmore with my own eyes.

36:00.895 --> 36:04.888
If you'd kept your mind on business,
you might have noticed that the state...

36:05.066 --> 36:09.503
...has placed the conservatorship
of the Kawatche cave under my control...

36:09.804 --> 36:11.567
...effective today.

36:12.473 --> 36:14.065
That's impossible.

36:15.042 --> 36:18.375
- I was under contract for five years.
- That's what I told the governor.

36:18.546 --> 36:22.107
But, apparently, somehow,
he's learned of a series of accidents...

36:22.283 --> 36:26.982
...and several unfortunate deaths
that occurred under your watch.

36:32.259 --> 36:34.591
I'm sorry, son.

36:36.664 --> 36:41.294
I've tried to teach you:
Always keep a sharp eye on the ball.

36:52.613 --> 36:56.174
- Smooth as silk. Good job, Dad.
- Thanks.

36:56.350 --> 36:59.114
You realize, Clark,
this baby is gonna be one lucky kid...

36:59.286 --> 37:01.550
...having you as an older brother.

37:01.889 --> 37:03.982
I mean that, Clark.

37:06.694 --> 37:09.219
Just a... Just a second.

37:15.069 --> 37:16.502
Lana.

37:18.472 --> 37:19.905
Hi.

37:20.941 --> 37:23.705
Lana, I heard Sheriff Adams
is still looking for Emily.

37:23.878 --> 37:26.813
But I'm concerned about you.
Are you doing okay?

37:26.981 --> 37:30.781
I'm gonna be fine. Just worried about Emily,
after all she's been through.

37:30.985 --> 37:34.318
- Yeah.
- I hope the police find her soon.

37:34.488 --> 37:36.251
I'm sure they will.

37:37.958 --> 37:41.189
Do you think I could borrow Clark
for a couple of minutes, Mr. Kent?

37:41.362 --> 37:43.660
Yeah, I don't see why not.

37:50.738 --> 37:53.571
If this is the mysterious Lana, I like it.

37:53.741 --> 37:55.868
What is this all about?

37:56.277 --> 37:58.905
Us, kind of.

38:02.650 --> 38:05.175
I just wanted to thank you for yesterday.

38:05.352 --> 38:09.686
There were a few minutes there
when I really thought I might be losing it.

38:09.857 --> 38:13.122
But you never doubted me.

38:14.228 --> 38:16.287
Not for a second.

38:18.465 --> 38:20.956
You always believe in me.

38:21.702 --> 38:23.932
It means a lot.

38:24.438 --> 38:26.702
Lana, what is this all about?

38:29.443 --> 38:32.207
It's just that sometimes I...

38:34.915 --> 38:38.612
I feel like you've created
this perfect picture of who I am.

38:40.888 --> 38:42.719
That's what I see.

38:47.528 --> 38:50.019
This might sound silly.

38:54.134 --> 38:57.535
But I have this fear that...

38:59.640 --> 39:03.440
That one day you'll finally get
a good look at me and...

39:08.682 --> 39:10.946
I'm going to disappoint you.

39:12.286 --> 39:15.983
That you'll see that I'm not as strong...

39:16.156 --> 39:18.317
...or as good as you think I am.

39:23.797 --> 39:28.097
And I'm afraid that it'll change the way
you feel about me.

39:36.310 --> 39:38.437
Nothing could ever do that.

40:12.613 --> 40:15.980
Maybe it's me that needs
to start believing in you.

40:32.232 --> 40:34.700
We'll do better next time.

40:34.868 --> 40:38.326
I assume this means
I can continue the project.

40:39.907 --> 40:43.775
I don't think that would be
a wise decision, Pete.

40:43.944 --> 40:46.879
You've jeopardized the research
once already.

40:47.047 --> 40:50.608
- You said you wanted a prototype.
- Yes, I did.

40:50.784 --> 40:53.617
And this phase has
brought us closer to our goal.

40:53.787 --> 40:58.520
But I don't want you working
on the project any longer.

41:00.928 --> 41:05.956
- You're too emotionally involved.
- She's flawed...

41:07.067 --> 41:10.332
...but she's my daughter.
- No. No, she's not.

41:10.504 --> 41:12.131
She's a poor approximation.

41:14.808 --> 41:18.266
This specimen is defective.

41:18.979 --> 41:21.447
You can't take her away from me.

41:23.050 --> 41:25.075
She's...

41:25.252 --> 41:27.220
...my life.

41:29.156 --> 41:31.681
She's the property of LuthorCorp.

41:52.079 --> 41:53.876
Hello, Emily.

41:55.749 --> 41:58.183
I don't like you.

42:02.923 --> 42:06.825
You know what I think, Emily?
I think...

42:09.029 --> 42:11.429
I think we just got off
on the wrong foot.

42:15.803 --> 42:17.532
Look at this.

42:24.244 --> 42:28.305
You want to hold him, Emily?
Go ahead.

42:47.201 --> 42:49.761
Where's my daddy?

42:51.438 --> 42:54.032
You mustn't worry about him, Emily.

42:56.176 --> 42:59.703
I'm gonna take very good care of you.
You'll see.

43:08.789 --> 43:11.883
What do you think
you should call your rabbit?

43:13.193 --> 43:18.130
- Bunny Buns.
- Bunny Buns? That's a beautiful name.

43:20.467 --> 43:25.268
This tastes good.
May I have some more?
