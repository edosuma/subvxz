00:01.102 --> 00:03.971
(knocking)

00:04.004 --> 00:05.473
- Hi there, Mr. Powell.

00:05.506 --> 00:10.344
- Hello, uh... guy.

00:10.378 --> 00:12.713
Sit. Have a seat.
- Okay, sure.

00:12.746 --> 00:16.050
- So a big client is coming in
today from out of town,

00:16.084 --> 00:19.853
and I need you to...

00:19.887 --> 00:21.389
entertain him.

00:21.422 --> 00:25.393
- Oh, wow, yes,
I-I'm honored that you'd ask.

00:25.426 --> 00:27.061
So what are we thinking?

00:27.095 --> 00:28.396
Steak dinner or...

00:28.429 --> 00:31.031
- No, he's a bit
of a sports buff.

00:31.065 --> 00:35.035
- Ooh, okay, great, yeah,
we could maybe take in a game.

00:35.069 --> 00:37.271
- I'll level with you.

00:37.305 --> 00:38.706
This client of which I speak,

00:38.739 --> 00:42.676
he's grown tired
of conventional sport.

00:42.710 --> 00:46.046
In fact, the only game
that thrills him anymore

00:46.080 --> 00:48.849
is the most dangerous game
of all.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.050
- Hockey?

00:50.084 --> 00:53.020
- This gentleman--
he likes to hunt man.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.955
- Oh, yeah, okay.

00:54.988 --> 00:56.624
That's-that's a wrinkle.

00:56.657 --> 00:59.560
Uh, will-will he be
hunting me,

00:59.593 --> 01:01.962
or will he and I
be pairing up?

01:01.995 --> 01:03.897
- It'll be you.
- Gotcha, cool, cool.

01:03.931 --> 01:06.033
(phone buzzing)

01:06.066 --> 01:09.036
Sorry, sorry.
- You should take it.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.539
Get your affairs in order.

01:11.572 --> 01:13.607
- Tha-thank you.

01:15.809 --> 01:17.811
- Good-bye.

01:17.845 --> 01:19.713
- Josh, I got a gig.
- What?

01:19.747 --> 01:21.582
Really?
- Yeah, this ad agency,

01:21.615 --> 01:23.617
they want me to do
some big national campaign.

01:23.651 --> 01:26.787
- Oh, my God, this is so...
this is so exciting.

01:26.820 --> 01:27.821
- I know, right?

01:27.855 --> 01:28.789
How's work for you?

01:28.822 --> 01:30.591
- Uh, you know,

01:30.624 --> 01:32.059
same old, same old.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.494
-(laughs)
- Uh, I-I got to go.

01:33.527 --> 01:34.528
Congratulations, I love you.

01:35.763 --> 01:38.732
(downtempo electronic music)

01:38.766 --> 01:39.733
*

01:39.767 --> 01:41.269
- Ah!

01:41.302 --> 01:44.472
*

01:44.505 --> 01:46.574
-(squeaks)

01:46.607 --> 01:48.276
*

01:48.309 --> 01:49.610
-(growls)

01:49.643 --> 01:51.645
*

02:07.195 --> 02:09.096
- Man, it's so cool
this agency's already

02:09.129 --> 02:10.598
inviting you to parties.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.700
- Yeah, it's great.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.802
- Do you think
there will be shrimp?

02:14.835 --> 02:16.136
- Maybe.

02:16.170 --> 02:17.538
Am I dressed okay?

02:17.571 --> 02:18.939
- Are you crazy?

02:18.972 --> 02:20.674
You look incredible.

02:20.708 --> 02:22.310
- Thanks, I just-I really want
to make a good impression, so...

02:22.343 --> 02:23.777
- Listen to me.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.179
You are brilliant,
the agency loves you,

02:25.213 --> 02:26.680
you look beautiful,

02:26.714 --> 02:29.016
and there's a strong
possibility of shrimp.

02:29.049 --> 02:31.118
This is gonna be
an awesome night.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.653
- Thanks, honey.
- Of course.

02:34.722 --> 02:37.525
All right.
- Okay.

02:37.558 --> 02:39.227
(upbeat music playing)

02:39.260 --> 02:42.630
Oh, wow, look at this place.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.164
Everyone here's so cool.

02:44.198 --> 02:45.466
- It's Lucy!
- Hi!

02:45.499 --> 02:47.735
- Lucy, I am so glad
you came.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.371
This is Sonia.

02:50.404 --> 02:52.139
She just got back
from a shoot in Iceland.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.241
- Oh, how was that?

02:53.274 --> 02:54.708
- Honestly, cold.

02:54.742 --> 02:56.344
(laughter)

02:56.377 --> 02:58.312
And, of course, I have to be
in Rome on Friday.

02:58.346 --> 02:59.880
- Shrimp?
- Oh, wow, you're going to Rome?

02:59.913 --> 03:01.549
I've always wanted to go.
- Shrimp?

03:01.582 --> 03:03.717
- Xavier here is a copywriter.
Amazing.

03:03.751 --> 03:05.819
And this is Lucy.
We snatched her up

03:05.853 --> 03:08.155
for the new headphone campaign
because she's a freaking genius.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.690
- Thank you, that's so nice.

03:09.723 --> 03:11.892
- And I am Josh.

03:12.893 --> 03:13.861
-(gasps)

03:13.894 --> 03:15.663
You have to meet Patrice.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.265
She's the creative director
at our New York office,

03:17.298 --> 03:18.532
and she loves your work.

03:18.566 --> 03:21.269
- Oh, my God,
I would love that, yeah.

03:21.302 --> 03:25.373
- So you guys like, uh, shrimp?

03:29.810 --> 03:32.145
Can I get a beer, please?

03:34.615 --> 03:35.616
Can I get a...

03:38.452 --> 03:40.454
Does this do anything for you?

03:40.488 --> 03:41.789
- Another white wine, please.

03:41.822 --> 03:43.591
Thank you.

03:47.828 --> 03:50.498
-(sighs)

03:54.302 --> 03:56.437
Um, is this seat taken?

03:56.470 --> 03:58.539
(ominous music)

03:58.572 --> 04:00.808
No?

04:00.841 --> 04:03.243
(sighs)

04:03.277 --> 04:04.445
Parties.

04:04.478 --> 04:08.616
*

04:08.649 --> 04:11.084
Well, those are
cool action figures.

04:11.118 --> 04:14.154
I-I actually had some
just like that.

04:14.187 --> 04:17.791
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

04:17.825 --> 04:20.494
- Can I tell you a secret?

04:20.528 --> 04:21.762
- Okay.

04:21.795 --> 04:24.832
- I see unsuccessful people.

04:24.865 --> 04:27.435
- Like, when you're
asleep or...

04:29.537 --> 04:30.804
When-when you're awake?

04:32.773 --> 04:36.510
Just, like, at bus stations,
in the mall, or what...

04:36.544 --> 04:40.514
- Everywhere, walking around,

04:40.548 --> 04:42.850
like regular people.

04:42.883 --> 04:44.685
They don't know
they're unsuccessful.

04:44.718 --> 04:48.322
- What? When was the last time
you saw one?

04:48.356 --> 04:50.791
- Right now.

04:50.824 --> 04:54.161
That guy tells people
he's going to culinary school,

04:54.194 --> 04:56.129
but he's just getting high
and watching the Food Network

04:56.163 --> 04:58.265
in his parents' basement.

04:58.298 --> 05:01.602
That woman thinks
she's a writer,

05:01.635 --> 05:04.372
but McSweeney's disagrees.

05:04.405 --> 05:09.109
That man tells people
he's a massage therapist.

05:09.142 --> 05:12.145
I wouldn't be surprised
if he's just giving handies.

05:12.179 --> 05:13.847
- Those poor people.

05:13.881 --> 05:16.517
- They don't know
their lives are over,

05:16.550 --> 05:18.051
that they're already dead.

05:18.085 --> 05:20.354
- How do they not know
they're unsuccessful?

05:20.388 --> 05:21.722
- Walter?

05:21.755 --> 05:23.123
Who are you talking to?

05:23.156 --> 05:25.559
*

05:25.593 --> 05:26.727
- No one.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.762
- What?

05:32.232 --> 05:35.068
(dramatic orchestral music)

05:35.102 --> 05:36.637
Oh, my God.

05:36.670 --> 05:39.172
*

05:39.206 --> 05:40.240
No.

05:40.273 --> 05:43.076
(distorted):
And I am Josh.

05:43.110 --> 05:44.745
*

05:44.778 --> 05:47.147
- I see unsuccessful people.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.417
*

05:49.450 --> 05:51.552
- No.

05:55.423 --> 05:57.825
- No. No, no, no, no!
- (exclaiming)

05:57.858 --> 06:00.360
Boom. In your eyeball, dawg.

06:00.394 --> 06:02.162
You suck ass at this game.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.597
It's embarrassing.
- What is that?

06:03.631 --> 06:05.332
That's eight in a row?
- Mm-hmm.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.434
What is going on, man?

06:06.467 --> 06:08.235
- Ah, it's-it's Lucy, man.

06:08.268 --> 06:09.703
She's got a new job,
which is...

06:09.737 --> 06:11.371
that's a good thing;
it's a good thing.

06:11.405 --> 06:13.407
But she's, like, hanging out
with all these cool,

06:13.441 --> 06:16.243
successful people,
and I'm worried

06:16.276 --> 06:18.045
she's, gonna, like,
outgrow me, you know?

06:18.078 --> 06:19.413
Is that-is that crazy?

06:19.447 --> 06:21.381
- Dude, come on.

06:21.415 --> 06:22.583
Of course she's gonna
outgrow you.

06:22.616 --> 06:23.717
- Hmm.

06:23.751 --> 06:24.718
- And probably, like,
pretty soon.

06:24.752 --> 06:26.286
- Oh, cool.

06:26.319 --> 06:28.121
Hi.
- Hi.

06:28.155 --> 06:29.523
Josh, how fast
can you get ready?

06:29.557 --> 06:31.191
'Cause we just got
invited to dinner.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.427
- Oh, um, I don't think
I need to remind you

06:33.461 --> 06:37.030
it's leftovers day,
and the lasagna's about to turn.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.066
- Celeste just got us
a table at Fork and Twig.

06:39.099 --> 06:41.368
- Ooh.
- Oh, who's Celeste?

06:41.401 --> 06:43.571
- She's the publisher.
Her husband's the architect?

06:43.604 --> 06:45.739
- These are people we know?
- Mike, you should come too.

06:45.773 --> 06:47.575
- Psh, hell yeah.

06:47.608 --> 06:50.043
Place has four dollar signs
on Yelp, so you know it's good.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.244
- It's gonna be so much fun.

06:51.278 --> 06:53.246
- Yes, and we get
to see Celeste.

06:53.280 --> 06:55.115
I don't think
I can afford this.

06:55.148 --> 06:57.217
- Relax, man.
How expensive could it be?

06:57.250 --> 06:59.252
(laughing,
indistinct conversations)

06:59.286 --> 07:00.454
- No, no, thank you.

07:00.488 --> 07:03.223
Tap water, tap water
all night long.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.959
You know, had, like,
a pretty serious lunch,

07:05.993 --> 07:07.427
so I'm not that hungry.

07:07.461 --> 07:09.730
Maybe-maybe you and I
just share something.

07:09.763 --> 07:12.399
- Oh, well, it's tapas style,
so we can share everything.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.234
- It's... What do you mean?

07:14.267 --> 07:16.003
- Well, they're little
share plates, which is great,

07:16.036 --> 07:17.304
'cause then you can just
get whatever you want,

07:17.337 --> 07:18.739
as much as you want,
and we'll just

07:18.772 --> 07:21.341
split the bill at the end.
- We-we split it?

07:21.374 --> 07:23.143
Like, equally?
- Mm-hmm.

07:23.176 --> 07:25.479
- Did you want to settle up
for your drinks at the bar?

07:25.513 --> 07:27.080
- Nah, just transfer it
to the table.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.315
- What?

07:28.348 --> 07:30.017
- In fact, we'll do
one more round?

07:30.050 --> 07:32.152
Yeah? And then we'll
switch over to the pinot.

07:32.185 --> 07:33.521
Who's drinking wine?
- Uh-huh.

07:33.554 --> 07:35.355
- Yup, you know it.
- Oh, I like this guy.

07:35.388 --> 07:37.424
All right, two bottles
of that to start,

07:37.457 --> 07:39.627
and then how we feeling
about apps?

07:39.660 --> 07:42.095
- Maybe we save room
for our mains.

07:42.129 --> 07:44.264
- Don't worry,
they're all very, very small.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.333
- Well, in that case,
we'll do two of each.

07:46.366 --> 07:47.334
(dramatic music)

07:47.367 --> 07:50.003
- Whoa, oh, yeah.

07:50.037 --> 07:51.471
-(laughs)

07:51.505 --> 07:54.007
*

07:54.041 --> 07:56.209
- This guy can order some shit.
- Get out of here.

07:56.243 --> 07:58.145
(laughter)

07:58.178 --> 07:59.312
- (whoops)

07:59.346 --> 08:00.814
*

08:06.353 --> 08:07.487
(laughter)

08:07.521 --> 08:10.057
This place rocks.

08:10.090 --> 08:12.392
You know what I'm saying, Josh?

08:12.425 --> 08:13.426
Where's Jo...

08:16.196 --> 08:19.166
(ominous music)

08:19.199 --> 08:21.201
*

08:24.672 --> 08:26.306
Josh, you in here, buddy?

08:26.339 --> 08:29.342
(adding machine clicking)

08:31.545 --> 08:35.215
- No, no, it can't be.
It can't be.

08:35.248 --> 08:37.551
- Hey, man, what's going on?

08:37.585 --> 08:39.519
- I've been running
the numbers.

08:39.553 --> 08:42.189
Mike, this bill's
gonna be a disaster.

08:42.222 --> 08:45.693
A disaster the likes of which
we have never seen.

08:45.726 --> 08:48.361
- Dude, it's gonna be fine.
- No, it's not going to be fine.

08:48.395 --> 08:51.531
As you can see, we've got
appetizers coming in from here.

08:51.565 --> 08:53.033
(beeping)

08:53.066 --> 08:54.334
Bartender keeps sending out

08:54.367 --> 08:56.036
more rounds from here and here.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.037
(beeping)

08:57.070 --> 08:58.205
And the mains,

08:58.238 --> 08:59.439
mains are coming in
from the north.

08:59.472 --> 09:01.074
I've never seen them
move so quickly.

09:01.108 --> 09:03.343
We are looking at
an extinction-level event.

09:03.376 --> 09:06.079
That means cash gone,
credit cards maxed.

09:06.113 --> 09:10.017
Check from Nana?
Wiped out completely.

09:10.050 --> 09:13.520
I'm saying
there will be nothing left.

09:13.553 --> 09:16.056
- MAN: Who wants in
on this paella? - Oh, I do.

09:16.089 --> 09:18.391
- Wait, what?
No!

09:18.425 --> 09:19.392
- Guess you guys hated that.

09:19.426 --> 09:20.628
(laughter)

09:20.661 --> 09:22.462
Can I tempt anyone
with dessert?

09:22.495 --> 09:24.632
- Nope, nope, nope,
we're fine.

09:24.665 --> 09:26.399
We're all fine.
Just the bill, please.

09:26.433 --> 09:28.535
- No, he's right,
we are pretty stuffed,

09:28.568 --> 09:32.640
though I could go for
a little after-dinner drink.

09:32.673 --> 09:34.374
Who wants champagne?

09:34.407 --> 09:38.478
Congratulations, Lucy.
The ad looks amazing.

09:38.511 --> 09:40.247
- Oh, my God.
- That bottle's not gonna do.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.448
What do you say,
bottle for everyone?

09:41.481 --> 09:42.750
Is that crazy?
It's fun, right?

09:42.783 --> 09:44.117
Why not?
Bottle for everyone.

09:44.151 --> 09:45.986
- Oh, enough!

09:46.019 --> 09:49.156
(echoing thump)
- Josh.

09:49.189 --> 09:50.457
- Can't you see?

09:50.490 --> 09:52.125
Can't any of you see?

09:52.159 --> 09:54.561
Well, open your eyes
and get ready,

09:54.594 --> 09:58.065
because there's a bill coming,
and none of you,

09:58.098 --> 09:59.667
none of you are ready for it.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.434
Did you even think
about gratuity?

10:01.468 --> 10:03.170
Well, guess what.

10:03.203 --> 10:05.272
There's more than six of us
at this table.

10:05.305 --> 10:06.774
Do you know what that means?

10:06.807 --> 10:08.776
It's automatic gratuity.

10:08.809 --> 10:10.610
So it's not gonna be 10%.

10:10.644 --> 10:13.113
It's not gonna be 15%.
You know what it's gonna be?

10:13.146 --> 10:16.016
It's gonna be 18%.

10:16.049 --> 10:18.185
18% tip!

10:18.218 --> 10:21.689
This meal is expensive!

10:21.722 --> 10:24.124
Oh, how we brought this
on ourselves.

10:24.157 --> 10:26.293
We brought this on ourselves.

10:26.326 --> 10:28.628
The moment we ordered
the extra avocado,

10:28.662 --> 10:30.764
we turned our backs on God,

10:30.798 --> 10:33.633
and now the chickens
are coming home to roost.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.635
And you all think I'm crazy.

10:35.669 --> 10:38.806
I'm your crazy dancing jester.

10:38.839 --> 10:41.108
You all think I'm crazy!

10:41.141 --> 10:44.144
I'm not crazy.
I'm not crazy.

10:44.177 --> 10:45.345
- Sorry.

10:45.378 --> 10:46.814
- Joshua.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.648
- Yeah?

10:48.682 --> 10:50.784
- I can pay for us.
It's fine.

10:50.818 --> 10:53.486
- Whoa, seriously?
- Yep, it's fine.

10:53.520 --> 10:54.554
- Oh, cool.

10:59.059 --> 11:01.795
So...

11:01.829 --> 11:05.165
cheers to my girlfriend, Lucy.

11:05.198 --> 11:07.567
(thunder booming)

11:07.600 --> 11:09.502
Eee.

11:09.536 --> 11:11.772
- Yeah, I'm on her card too.

11:14.407 --> 11:16.409
(knocking)
- JOSH: Yeah, oh, I'll get it.

11:16.443 --> 11:18.511
- Good morning!

11:18.545 --> 11:19.880
- Hi.
- I was just

11:19.913 --> 11:21.348
in the neighborhood,
and I hoped I could

11:21.381 --> 11:23.083
tempt you both to brunch.
- Brunch?

11:23.116 --> 11:25.218
What a great idea.
Lucy, would you like brunch?

11:25.252 --> 11:27.988
Um, I'm buying,
how about that?

11:28.021 --> 11:31.391
I'm buying. We go to that diner
under the freeway.

11:31.424 --> 11:32.893
- You know what?
I actually just think

11:32.926 --> 11:34.227
I'm gonna go for a walk.

11:34.261 --> 11:35.628
It's nice to see you, Liz.
- Hi.

11:38.265 --> 11:40.500
Yikes.
- Yeah.

11:40.533 --> 11:43.203
I just...
I don't know how I...

11:43.236 --> 11:45.372
I can make it up
to her, you know?

11:45.405 --> 11:49.242
I... Maybe, maybe I sell
my comic books, some...

11:49.276 --> 11:52.913
some of my comic books on eBay

11:52.946 --> 11:55.048
and then use the money
I get from that

11:55.082 --> 11:56.884
to buy her some jewelry.

11:56.917 --> 12:00.353
- Josh, Lucy's not with you
because you're rich

12:00.387 --> 12:04.057
or successful or because
you have a cool job

12:04.091 --> 12:05.926
that's interesting
or pays well

12:05.959 --> 12:09.863
or because you're worldly
or have an interesting style.

12:09.897 --> 12:11.298
- Okay.
- So if you're gonna

12:11.331 --> 12:14.868
give her a present,
it should be from the heart.

12:14.902 --> 12:16.904
Maybe you should
make her something.

12:16.937 --> 12:19.072
Ooh, she's an artist.
She'd love that.

12:19.106 --> 12:21.141
- I'm-I'm not good
at making things.

12:21.174 --> 12:23.243
- That doesn't matter.
It's the thought that counts.

12:23.276 --> 12:24.744
- Huh.

12:24.778 --> 12:29.416
The thought that counts.
Yeah.

12:29.449 --> 12:30.984
Yeah.

12:31.018 --> 12:33.987
(upbeat orchestral music)

12:34.021 --> 12:35.989
*

12:59.146 --> 13:02.749
All right, uh, haven't
shown it to her yet, but...

13:02.782 --> 13:04.818
I think it might be pretty good.

13:04.852 --> 13:06.119
- I'm so excited.
- Yeah, bro.

13:06.153 --> 13:07.120
It's cool you
made her something.

13:07.154 --> 13:08.956
- Thank you so much.

13:08.989 --> 13:11.658
Without further ado,

13:11.691 --> 13:13.660
I give you

13:13.693 --> 13:16.696
"Bowl of Cherries
on an End Table."

13:27.007 --> 13:29.442
- Uh...
- Um...

13:29.476 --> 13:32.312
- Wow.
- It is so special.

13:32.345 --> 13:33.713
- Thanks, thank you.

13:33.746 --> 13:35.382
- Looks like you used
a lot of color.

13:35.415 --> 13:36.383
- Mm.

13:36.416 --> 13:37.484
- Really looks like

13:37.517 --> 13:39.152
you used a lot of paint.

13:39.186 --> 13:40.353
- Thank you, yeah, I did.

13:40.387 --> 13:43.290
Um, Mike?

13:43.323 --> 13:45.993
- Dude, I gotta be real.
It's not great.

13:46.026 --> 13:48.828
- Okay, well, that-that's
not constructive or helpful.

13:48.862 --> 13:51.331
What-what part specifically
don't you like?

13:51.364 --> 13:55.002
- If I'm being
totally honest here, to me,

13:55.035 --> 13:58.071
it kind of looks like a picture
of you sucking a dog's dick.

13:59.372 --> 14:01.909
- Hmm.

14:01.942 --> 14:05.012
Wow, I-I don't see that at all.

14:05.045 --> 14:06.079
Which bit?

14:06.113 --> 14:07.680
- Ah, well, uh,

14:07.714 --> 14:10.817
the dog's head is there,
you're there,

14:10.850 --> 14:14.754
and that's clearly the dog dick
going into your mouth.

14:14.787 --> 14:17.690
- Hmm, every painting
is open to interpretation.

14:17.724 --> 14:19.893
- What about the speech bubble
there where the dog

14:19.927 --> 14:22.829
is literally saying,
"Woof, woof, cowabunga.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.364
Thanks for the blow job"?

14:24.397 --> 14:26.199
- That-that was meant
to be a cherry.

14:26.233 --> 14:27.935
They're all cherries.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.702
That's a cherry.
That's supposed to be a ch...

14:29.736 --> 14:31.939
Uh, Liz, help me out here.

14:31.972 --> 14:34.607
- Um...

14:34.641 --> 14:36.709
- God damn it, now I see it.

14:36.743 --> 14:40.347
It looks like a painting
of me sucking a dog's dick.

14:40.380 --> 14:43.216
- And the dog is saying,
"Woof, woof, cowabunga."

14:43.250 --> 14:45.185
- Thanks for the blow..."
Yeah, okay.

14:45.218 --> 14:49.189
Let me rectify.
Just do a last-minute alter-oo.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.124
Hmm.

14:51.158 --> 14:54.094
Okay, what about that?
Is that any better?

14:54.127 --> 14:55.728
Working for you?
- Well, now you're just

14:55.762 --> 14:57.130
giving a thumbs-up.

14:57.164 --> 14:59.099
Makes it look like
you're really enjoying it.

14:59.132 --> 15:00.733
- Like it was your idea.

15:00.767 --> 15:03.070
And the dog is just
going along with it.

15:03.103 --> 15:04.972
- Damn it, I should
throw this in the garbage.

15:05.005 --> 15:07.107
Although, Liz, you did say,

15:07.140 --> 15:08.976
"It's the thought that counts."

15:09.009 --> 15:10.343
- I was wrong.

15:13.780 --> 15:15.782
- Oh, shit.

15:16.950 --> 15:18.418
- Josh, what are you doing?

15:18.451 --> 15:22.956
- Uh, nothing, nothing.
Everything is normal and fine.

15:22.990 --> 15:25.158
- Jesus, all right, great.
- Okay, fine, wait, look.

15:25.192 --> 15:28.161
I know I messed up
at the dinner.

15:28.195 --> 15:31.098
I did.
And so I tried to paint you

15:31.131 --> 15:36.103
a thing... 'cause I know
you like cherries.

15:36.136 --> 15:38.005
It was supposed to be
a bowl of cherries,

15:38.038 --> 15:39.839
but I can't even do that right.

15:39.872 --> 15:42.275
One more classic
Greenberg failure.

15:42.309 --> 15:44.277
- Josh, what is
going on with you?

15:44.311 --> 15:46.813
- I don't have,
like, a cool job.

15:46.846 --> 15:48.848
I don't make a lot of money.

15:48.881 --> 15:52.152
I am, at best, a B-plus painter.

15:52.185 --> 15:55.188
And yeah, I'm just
treading water trying to,

15:55.222 --> 15:57.790
like, keep up
with all your cool new friends.

15:57.824 --> 15:59.126
- Stop trying, okay?

15:59.159 --> 16:01.028
Stop trying to be
some cool, new dude.

16:01.061 --> 16:03.763
You're driving me crazy.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.932
Just please, please
just be guy that I met.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.035
I miss that guy.

16:08.068 --> 16:09.802
A lot.

16:09.836 --> 16:12.305
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

16:12.339 --> 16:15.142
- Yeah, I guess I could
try a bit harder at,

16:15.175 --> 16:17.344
you know, not trying.

16:17.377 --> 16:19.446
- Okay.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.014
Can we go in?

16:22.849 --> 16:26.786
- Hey, uh, you want to know
something kind of embarrassing?

16:26.819 --> 16:30.357
Uh, that-that painting

16:30.390 --> 16:32.825
was actually my best one.

16:32.859 --> 16:34.327
- There were
worse ones than that?

16:34.361 --> 16:37.630
- Oh, yeah.

16:37.664 --> 16:40.400
This one was supposed to be
a bowl of pears.

16:42.702 --> 16:43.703
- Uh-huh.
- Yup.

16:43.736 --> 16:45.672
This one was meant to be grapes.

16:45.705 --> 16:47.840
I don't know how that happened.

16:47.874 --> 16:49.809
This one was just a mango.

16:49.842 --> 16:52.011
Literally just a mango.

16:52.045 --> 16:55.182
So then I was like, "Maybe I'll
just paint me blowing an owl,"

16:55.215 --> 16:56.983
in the hopes that it
would turn out to be,

16:57.016 --> 16:58.885
like, a bowl of apples.

16:58.918 --> 17:00.019
- Mm-hmm.

17:00.053 --> 17:02.021
- No-no such luck.

17:02.055 --> 17:04.691
- Why is the owl saying,
"Woof, woof, cowabunga.

17:04.724 --> 17:05.892
Thanks for the blow job"?

17:05.925 --> 17:07.760
Shouldn't it be, like,

17:07.794 --> 17:09.696
"hoot, hoot"
'cause it's an owl?

17:09.729 --> 17:11.364
- It-it should be
"hoot, hoot," yeah.

17:11.398 --> 17:13.666
Uh, I don't know.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.768
I guess I have a style.

17:15.802 --> 17:16.903
-(chuckles)

17:16.936 --> 17:18.338
Yeah, I think you do.

17:18.371 --> 17:22.041
- * Oh, Randy,
leave it up to me *

17:22.075 --> 17:25.412
* I'll pour the water
if you bring the tree *

17:29.782 --> 17:31.251
- Hey, thanks for coming with me

17:31.284 --> 17:33.052
to another one of these.
- Oh, I wouldn't miss it.

17:33.086 --> 17:35.255
- Lucy, you have to meet
Edgar and Anna.

17:35.288 --> 17:37.557
They just wrote an opera.

17:37.590 --> 17:40.260
(hip-hop music playing)

17:42.662 --> 17:43.630
- Hello.

17:43.663 --> 17:44.631
(ominous music)

17:44.664 --> 17:46.733
- Ugh, hello.

17:46.766 --> 17:48.368
- You're unsuccessful.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.736
- Okay, you know what, kid?

17:49.769 --> 17:52.071
I might not make
a ton of money

17:52.105 --> 17:53.973
or have, like, a cool job,

17:54.006 --> 17:55.442
but I'll tell you
what I do have.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.277
What I do have
is a very cool girlfriend

17:57.310 --> 17:59.312
who's very talented,
and she loves me a lot.

17:59.346 --> 18:00.747
So you know what?

18:00.780 --> 18:03.550
In my book, that makes me
pretty darn successful.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.385
- Your hair is stupid.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.920
- You're just, like,
a little shit, aren't you?

18:07.954 --> 18:09.489
- Guilty.

18:09.522 --> 18:12.425
- Josh, come here.

18:12.459 --> 18:15.928
Guys, I don't think you
really met my boyfriend, Josh.

18:15.962 --> 18:18.598
- Oh, hey, so nice to meet you.
I didn't even see you come in.

18:18.631 --> 18:20.333
- We've heard so much about you.
- Oh, cool.

18:20.367 --> 18:23.403
- Shrimp?
- Oh, uh, yeah.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.572
Don't-don't mind if I do.

18:25.605 --> 18:28.941
(upbeat rock music)

18:28.975 --> 18:31.278
- * Yeah *

18:31.311 --> 18:33.313
*

19:08.415 --> 19:10.417
