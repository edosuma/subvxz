00:04.001 --> 00:10.500
From space, it seems an abstraction, a
magician's trick on a darkened stage.

00:10.500 --> 00:15.500
And from this distance one might
never imagine that it is alive.

00:17.000 --> 00:24.800
It first appeared in the sea almost four billion
years ago in the form of single-celled life.

00:24.800 --> 00:27.400
In an explosion of life spanning
millions of years, ...

00:27.400 --> 00:35.000
...nature's first multicellular organisms
began to multiply... and then it stopped.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.800
440 million years ago, a great mass extinction
would kill off nearly every species...

00:40.800 --> 00:46.700
...on the planet leaving the vast
oceans decimated and empty.

00:46.700 --> 00:51.800
Slowly, plants began to evolve,
then insects, ...

00:51.800 --> 00:57.500
...only to be wiped out in the second
great mass extinction upon the Earth.

00:57.500 --> 01:00.500
The cycle repeated again and again.

01:00.500 --> 01:05.800
Reptiles emerging, independent of
the sea only to be killed off.

01:05.800 --> 01:13.000
Then dinosaurs, struggling to life along with
the first birds, fish, and flowering plants...

01:13.000 --> 01:19.400
...their decimations Earth's fourth
and fifth great extinctions.

01:19.700 --> 01:25.800
Only 100,000 years ago,
Homo Sapiens appear... man.

01:25.800 --> 01:30.400
From cave paintings to the Bible
to Columbus and Apollo 11, ...

01:30.400 --> 01:34.800
...we have been a tireless force
upon the earth and off...

01:34.800 --> 01:39.400
...cataloguing the natural world
as it unfolds to us.

01:39.400 --> 01:43.200
Rising to a world population
of over five billion people...

01:43.200 --> 01:49.300
...all descended from that original single
cell, that first spark of life.

01:50.800 --> 01:54.800
But for all our knowledge, what no
one can say for certain, ...

01:54.800 --> 01:59.900
...is what or who ignited
that original spark.

01:59.900 --> 02:05.800
Is there a plan, a purpose or a
reason to our existence?

02:05.800 --> 02:10.800
Will we pass, as those before us,
into oblivion, ...

02:10.800 --> 02:15.700
...into the sixth extinction that
scientists warn is already in progress?

Or will the mystery be
revealed through a sign, ...

02:30.600 --> 02:33.000
...a symbol, ...

02:33.200 --> 02:35.800
...a revelation?

06:42.900 --> 06:49.400
Excuse me, I'm looking for the Biology
Department for a Professor Sandoz.

07:19.600 --> 07:23.700
Dr. Sandoz? Professor Sandoz,
I'm Solomon Merkmallen.

07:23.700 --> 07:26.700
Dr. Merkmallen. My God, I thought
something had happened to you.

07:26.700 --> 07:30.400
Oh. Did you not get my message?
We were delayed in Frankfurt.

07:30.400 --> 07:32.600
Look, the important thing is
you're here now, and you're safe.

07:32.600 --> 07:33.600
Yes.

07:33.600 --> 07:37.300
Uh... you brought me something... this,
uh... this discovery of yours.

07:37.300 --> 07:38.700
Yes.

07:38.700 --> 07:41.100
I'm quite anxious to see it.

07:41.100 --> 07:44.200
I-I was concerned I might be
relieved of it in customs.

07:44.200 --> 07:48.400
There was some trouble with
the X-ray machine in Germany.

07:54.200 --> 07:59.100
- What kind of trouble did you have?
- I told you of its power.

07:59.900 --> 08:00.900
Yes, of course.

08:00.900 --> 08:05.900
My credentials were the only thing that
prevented me from being further detained.

08:22.200 --> 08:28.400
I can't explain how it is... but the
two pieces have become one.

08:29.900 --> 08:35.400
I was hoping they'd match the piece that you've
found so that you might see for yourself its magic.

08:35.400 --> 08:39.000
Have you had any luck reading it?

08:39.200 --> 08:42.400
You're not Dr. Sandoz, are you?

09:30.900 --> 09:33.300
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, DC

09:33.300 --> 09:38.700
A case like this I, of course, thought of your obvious interest.
Merkmallen's views and theories being what they were.

09:38.700 --> 09:42.200
I believe Agent Mulder is
familiar with his work.

09:42.900 --> 09:47.900
Dr. Solomon Merkmallen, Professor of Biology,
University of Ivory Coast.

09:47.900 --> 09:53.200
He flew in yesterday from Africa. Two hours later,
he was apparently murdered at American University.

09:53.200 --> 09:56.700
His body is missing but there was enough
blood found on the floor to make a fair assumption.

09:56.700 --> 09:59.000
A couple of students also confirmed
that they spoke to him when...

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
...he asked them for directions to find a
Dr. Steven Sandoz, also a Professor of Biology.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.700
Both men espouse a fringe theory called
"Panspermia". It's the belief that life originated...

10:07.700 --> 10:10.100
...elsewhere... in this universe.

10:10.100 --> 10:11.200
- You've heard of this?
- Yeah.

10:11.200 --> 10:17.300
It's the idea that Mars or other planets were
habitable long before Earth and that, uh, ...

10:17.300 --> 10:20.900
...cosmic collisions on these
planets blasted microbes...

10:20.900 --> 10:24.200
...into our solar system, some of
which landed and flourished here.

10:24.200 --> 10:29.300
- You'd accept that as plausible?
- Well, almost any scientist would... theoretically.

10:29.300 --> 10:33.200
I mean, it's just a theory.
That's about it, though.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.700
You don't think this has anything
to do with his death, do you?

10:35.700 --> 10:38.600
Dr. Merkmallen found an
artifact in his country.

10:38.600 --> 10:41.000
This is a rubbing of that artifact.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
He claimed it contained a message,
not only of his Mars theories but...

10:44.000 --> 10:46.300
...the very meaning of human existence.

10:46.300 --> 10:48.200
Much less plausible.

10:48.200 --> 10:53.200
Dr. Sandoz, the man he'd come to meet made
a similar claim in a "science" journal.

10:53.200 --> 10:57.700
He said he'd found an artifact that was almost
identical to that with similar writings on it.

10:57.700 --> 11:02.900
- And what was it supposed to say?
- Well, we'd have to ask Dr. Sandoz that.

11:02.900 --> 11:06.700
- Well, why don't we?
- We can't. He's missing.

11:09.500 --> 11:13.300
What are we doing, Mulder?
This is a police matter at best.

11:13.300 --> 11:15.100
Skinner wants us on the case.

11:15.100 --> 11:18.700
Are you going to try and convince me that
you have no personal interest in this case?

11:18.700 --> 11:22.400
- I am just a hired gun for the FBI.
- Oh, come on.

11:22.400 --> 11:24.600
What if there's something to this?

11:24.600 --> 11:27.900
Two men suggesting that
we're all Martians.

11:27.900 --> 11:30.500
Now why would they possibly
come into foul play?

11:30.500 --> 11:34.000
That's what we're being
asked to figure out.

11:47.700 --> 11:50.600
I can't understand you, Mulder.

11:50.600 --> 11:56.800
You're willing to pursue any case involving
aliens no matter how tenuous the connection.

12:00.700 --> 12:06.200
There has to be some... limit to your interest...

12:09.500 --> 12:17.800
I mean, this endless pursuit of the truth, Mulder,
it just... it doesn't make any sense to me now.

12:19.200 --> 12:21.100
Mulder?

12:21.600 --> 12:24.200
Did you hear a word
of what I just said?

12:24.200 --> 12:25.500
No.

12:25.500 --> 12:27.400
No?

12:28.700 --> 12:30.800
Well, maybe you didn't want to hear it.

12:30.800 --> 12:33.200
No...

12:33.700 --> 12:36.300
I couldn't hear it.

12:42.200 --> 12:44.200
Mulder...

12:45.600 --> 12:50.400
Look, after all you've done,
after all you've uncovered, ...

12:50.400 --> 12:54.200
...a conspiracy of men doing
human experiments, ...

12:54.200 --> 12:58.500
...men who are all now dead,
you exposed their secrets.

12:58.500 --> 13:01.600
I mean, you've won.

13:02.400 --> 13:06.900
What more could you possibly
hope to do or to find?

13:06.900 --> 13:10.000
My sister.

13:36.800 --> 13:40.400
Guess I was right about this
being a police matter.

13:42.600 --> 13:44.600
Detective?

13:44.600 --> 13:47.100
- Can I help you?
- Agents Mulder and Scully with the FBI.

13:47.100 --> 13:48.100
What do you have here?

13:48.100 --> 13:51.300
Probable weapon, blood and hair on it.
Looks like prints, too.

13:51.300 --> 13:56.000
- Any word on this Dr. Sandoz?
- No, but we're being told the prints are very likely his.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.600
Told by whom?

13:57.600 --> 14:00.200
The man your partner's
speaking with.

14:00.200 --> 14:04.700
- I'm Fox Mulder with the FBI.
- I'm Dr. Barnes, head of the department.

14:04.700 --> 14:08.300
They've asked me to suspend classes
and organize interviews with the faculty.

14:08.300 --> 14:10.700
Any ideas yourself about
what happened here?

14:10.700 --> 14:14.100
- There's plenty of speculation.
- About the missing Dr. Sandoz?

14:14.100 --> 14:17.600
Apart from his laughable ideas my colleague
was capable of almost anything...

14:17.600 --> 14:20.200
...to advance his rather
questionable reputation.

14:20.200 --> 14:22.300
Capable of murder?

14:22.300 --> 14:27.600
Dr. Sandoz's notes are full of talk about
an artifact coming over from West Africa...

14:27.600 --> 14:30.700
...but like the man who was bringing
it that artifact has yet to be located.

14:30.700 --> 14:33.900
Are you, uh, speaking of this?

14:44.600 --> 14:46.600
Mulder?

14:47.200 --> 14:51.300
Do you know Dr. Sandoz believes
this writing was from aliens?

14:51.300 --> 14:54.900
These are trivial men. They have no
patience for the scientific process.

14:54.900 --> 14:57.600
They're happy to read their
names in the tabloids.

14:57.600 --> 15:02.000
Pseudoscientists.
Beyond embarrassment.

15:13.500 --> 15:16.100
- What is it, Mulder?
- I don't know.

15:16.100 --> 15:18.900
It's, uh... a hollow noise.

15:18.900 --> 15:23.000
The same thing that happened to me
at work in the elevator this morning.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.100
- Do you have a fever?
- No.

15:25.100 --> 15:29.500
This is going to sound weird
but I think it's that thing.

15:29.500 --> 15:32.100
You're not kidding.

15:34.100 --> 15:37.100
It's just a piece of paper.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.400
I recognize the ideography.

15:46.600 --> 15:48.400
You're late.

15:49.100 --> 15:52.300
I'm sorry. I thought
this was my office.

15:52.300 --> 15:54.000
Fox.

15:54.200 --> 15:57.700
I called Chuck as I knew you
would for authentication, ...

15:57.700 --> 16:01.000
...and to get his professional opinion
on how you say it's affecting you.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.500
- Fascinating, Mulder.
- You don't believe it, Chuck?

16:03.500 --> 16:07.400
No, no. You know me.
This is right up my twisted little alley.

16:07.400 --> 16:10.600
So, uh... what exactly are
you experiencing?

16:10.600 --> 16:13.900
Noise. Aural dissonance.
It comes and it goes.

16:13.900 --> 16:17.300
- Is it happening right now?
- No, but it was a few minutes ago.

16:17.300 --> 16:21.600
And it's only affecting you,
triggered by the rubbing.

16:21.600 --> 16:24.500
Wow. That blows me away.

16:24.500 --> 16:27.600
- Why?
- Because the rubbing is a fake...

16:27.600 --> 16:30.000
...and I'm not the first one to say so.

16:30.000 --> 16:35.400
The writing is Cree, phonetic Navajo, but no
literal interpretation makes any sense.

16:35.400 --> 16:40.000
And the fact that it was found in Africa makes
it all the more suspicious as a fabrication.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.200
- Suspicious of what?
- Do you know what a Magic Square is?

16:43.200 --> 16:46.100
- Yeah. It has to do with the occult.
- Right. Very cool.

16:46.100 --> 16:52.000
They first appear in the ninth
century in history but, uh...

16:54.600 --> 16:59.500
...as the story goes God himself
instructed Adam in their use...

16:59.500 --> 17:03.300
...and then handed down the secret to all
his saints and prophets and wise men...

17:03.300 --> 17:06.500
...as a way of trapping and
storing potential power...

17:06.500 --> 17:11.400
...to the person whose name or numerical
correlative exercises that power.

17:11.400 --> 17:12.900
That's what this thing is?

17:12.900 --> 17:15.200
Well, that's what someone would
have you believe this is.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.400
How do you know that?

17:16.400 --> 17:20.900
As it turns out neither of us had
to go very far to find out.

17:25.900 --> 17:30.400
Barnes documented Sandoz's
fakery once before.

17:30.400 --> 17:34.400
If he was blunt about his colleague when
we met him, in here, he is downright brutal.

17:34.400 --> 17:38.800
- Does he back any of that up?
- Well, it's quite scholarly, actually.

17:38.800 --> 17:46.100
Barnes has made something of a career
exposing science and religious fraud.

17:46.100 --> 17:49.800
Name your wonder of the world,
he's been there, debunked that.

17:49.800 --> 17:53.800
Yeah, but wouldn't it be in his great interest
to hide something that he couldn't...

17:53.800 --> 17:55.500
...disprove with his scholarship?

17:55.500 --> 17:59.000
Well, Mulder, if it were real then why
would an American Indian artifact...

17:59.000 --> 18:02.400
...be fused in rock on the west coast
of the African continent?

18:02.400 --> 18:06.600
In 1996, a rock from Mars was found
in Antarctica. How did it get there?

18:06.600 --> 18:09.100
It was from outer space.

18:09.100 --> 18:11.500
Begs the question, doesn't it?

18:11.500 --> 18:16.100
Why produce a fraud with
Navajo writing...

18:17.100 --> 18:19.700
...in Africa?

18:22.600 --> 18:24.500
Mulder?

18:29.900 --> 18:32.100
Let's step outside.

18:32.500 --> 18:35.100
Step outside.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
You're in pain.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.800
No, no, it's going away.

18:51.200 --> 18:56.100
Mulder, whatever is causing this
I think it needs immediate attention.

18:56.100 --> 18:59.500
- I'm going to schedule you an imagining scan.
- No, I'm okay. I really am.

18:59.500 --> 19:03.000
Mulder, you're not okay. If nothing else,
you should be at home in bed.

19:03.000 --> 19:07.800
I'm not going home to bed, Scully.
I think I know what's causing this...

19:07.800 --> 19:10.200
...and I know what happened to those
two professors and that artifact.

19:10.200 --> 19:13.500
I got a sense of it yesterday
when I met that man Barnes.

19:13.500 --> 19:17.500
- You had a sense of it?
- Yes. This man Solomon Merkmallen is dead.

19:17.500 --> 19:22.400
Barnes knows it. He killed him,
killed him in that lab.

19:22.800 --> 19:26.800
Well, I hope you're not going to suggest that
we arrest him on that rather baseless assumption.

19:26.800 --> 19:28.500
No, I'm not...

19:28.500 --> 19:32.300
Not until after I show you what
he did with the body.

19:36.400 --> 19:39.900
SANDOZ RESIDENCE
SILVER SPRING, MARYLAND

19:44.300 --> 19:47.100
I been all through the place.
You know what you're looking for?

19:47.100 --> 19:50.000
- We'll let you know if we find it.
- Ah...

19:50.900 --> 19:55.500
Cops have been here, too, you know.
They couldn't find nothing, either.

19:57.700 --> 20:01.500
- We'll come get you to...
- Yeah, yeah.

20:26.900 --> 20:32.200
Whatever happened to Dr. Sandoz, he certainly
liked to fly south for the winter... a lot.

20:32.200 --> 20:35.100
Gallup, New Mexico.
Navajo country.

20:35.100 --> 20:38.700
Well, I think I know who he was going to see.

20:41.400 --> 20:45.300
- That's Albert Hosteen.
- Your World War II code-talker.

20:45.300 --> 20:49.400
Maybe he was using him to read
the symbols on the artifact.

20:49.800 --> 20:52.200
Or write them.

20:52.200 --> 20:55.500
Mulder, you also said that
we'd find a body.

20:55.500 --> 20:59.000
Care to make good on
that prediction?

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
Scully, you packing any latex?

21:07.000 --> 21:08.200
No. Why?

21:08.200 --> 21:11.700
Doesn't it smell like somebody
forgot to take out the garbage?

21:32.400 --> 21:35.100
Oh, God.

21:42.200 --> 21:45.100
So you think Dr. Sandoz is innocent?

21:45.100 --> 21:49.600
He's afraid for his life because
of what he knows and what he has.

21:49.600 --> 21:51.100
This?

21:51.100 --> 21:55.100
A genuine artifact, one of several
pieces of an unknown whole.

21:55.100 --> 21:58.700
Dr. Barnes has one now, too.
That's why he killed Solomon Merkmallen.

21:58.700 --> 22:00.400
But, the way his body
was disposed of...

22:00.400 --> 22:03.200
...was to incriminate Sandoz, to
make him look like the killer.

22:03.200 --> 22:05.500
It's also to hide something.

22:05.500 --> 22:09.100
Something that no one would think to look for.
Scully, could you please tell...

22:09.100 --> 22:11.800
...what your medical exam found
in the lab report?

22:11.800 --> 22:16.100
Parts of his body were missing,
his arms, his hands, uh, ...

22:16.100 --> 22:19.300
...parts of his vital organs
and his thyroid.

22:19.300 --> 22:23.500
All of which would retain
telltale traces of radiation.

22:23.500 --> 22:26.900
- Radiation from what?
- The artifact.

22:26.900 --> 22:30.600
On Agent Mulder's urging I ran tissue
samples through what's called...

22:30.600 --> 22:34.600
...a charged particle
directional spectrometer.

22:34.600 --> 22:38.200
There were traces of a kind
of radiation called C.G.R.

22:38.200 --> 22:44.500
Cosmic Galactic Radiation. It's a kind of
radiation that's found only outside our solar system.

22:44.500 --> 22:46.000
Agent Scully?

22:46.000 --> 22:49.700
I don't know how to explain it but
I feel that we can make an arrest.

22:49.700 --> 22:53.800
Oh, forget the arrest.
We got to find these artifacts.

22:53.800 --> 22:55.800
Agent Mulder?

22:56.600 --> 22:59.000
Is there someone else on
this case, sir?

22:59.000 --> 23:00.600
Excuse me?

23:00.600 --> 23:03.500
There's someone else on this case,
you're not telling me.

23:03.500 --> 23:07.500
- What's the hell's he talking about?
- I hear it... in my head.

23:07.500 --> 23:09.600
Mulder, let's go.

23:21.800 --> 23:24.600
- Mulder, you're losing it.
- No, I'm not.

23:24.600 --> 23:29.300
Listen to me, he's not telling the truth.
I'm hearing people. He's spying on us.

23:29.300 --> 23:32.400
Mulder, you need to see a doctor.

23:32.400 --> 23:37.500
- I need to find those artifacts.
- I'll find the artifacts. You need to go home right now.

23:37.500 --> 23:39.800
Mulder?

24:26.900 --> 24:30.900
SOUTHWESTERN GENERAL HOSPITAL
GALLUP, NEW MEXICO

25:01.900 --> 25:05.900
"And God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply,
and replenish the earth, and subdue it:

25:05.900 --> 25:09.100
...and have dominion over the fish of the sea,
and over the fowl of the air, and over every
living thing that moveth upon the earth."

25:09.100 --> 25:15.200
- Is there something you're looking for?
- Yes, I was looking to speak to Mr. Hosteen.

25:15.200 --> 25:18.200
Mr. Hosteen cannot accept any
visitors at this time.

25:18.200 --> 25:21.400
Yes, I understand. I saw him wheeled
out of here in an emergency.

25:21.400 --> 25:22.900
Can you tell me what's
wrong with him?

25:22.900 --> 25:25.200
I'm not allowed to give out
that kind of information.

25:25.200 --> 25:29.200
I, um, I know him.
He's helped me in the past.

25:29.200 --> 25:33.000
I'm sure that he wouldn't mind
you telling me.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.600
Albert has cancer.
He's suffering from its effects.

25:36.600 --> 25:39.100
He's dying.

26:26.600 --> 26:28.600
Dr. Barnes?

29:31.200 --> 29:35.400
Okay... I need answers from you.

30:15.700 --> 30:18.600
Are you the man who called?

30:20.800 --> 30:23.200
Dr. Barnes...

30:23.500 --> 30:24.600
Yes.

30:24.600 --> 30:27.600
Dr. Barnes you and I are...

30:27.600 --> 30:31.100
...destined to be great friends.

30:34.700 --> 30:39.200
Albert was the only translator who
didn't dismiss me out of hand.

30:39.200 --> 30:44.700
When I showed him the original artifact he
sensed immediately its power and importance.

30:44.700 --> 30:48.500
The trouble was, it was only one
fragment, not enough to read.

30:48.500 --> 30:50.600
But then other pieces surfaced.

30:50.600 --> 30:53.800
Dr. Merkmallen found two more
in the tidal shallows.

30:53.800 --> 30:59.400
He sent me a rubbing. Suddenly, Albert
was able to make a real translation.

30:59.400 --> 31:05.500
A passage from the Bible on an artifact
that you're saying is extraterrestrial.

31:05.500 --> 31:08.400
And, uh, how did the aliens get it?

31:08.400 --> 31:11.700
They gave it to us.
The text came from them.

31:11.700 --> 31:13.800
I can prove it.

31:13.800 --> 31:17.400
It's written here.
I'm sure of it.

31:20.400 --> 31:24.300
Albert was working to translate another
section when his health turned.

31:24.300 --> 31:28.100
And, uh, this was going
to tell us what?

31:28.100 --> 31:34.000
I don't know yet. Albert said it
just seemed to be random letters.

31:47.600 --> 31:50.000
- Hello?
- Hello? Ehh..

31:50.000 --> 31:52.700
I'm sorry. I'm trying
to reach Fox Mulder.

31:52.700 --> 31:55.900
Hold on, please.
Fox?

32:01.800 --> 32:02.600
Hello?

32:02.600 --> 32:05.200
- Mulder, where are you?
- I'm here. I'm resting.

32:05.200 --> 32:08.000
Where?
Who answered the phone?

32:08.000 --> 32:11.200
I'm home. It's okay.
Where are you?

32:11.200 --> 32:14.700
I'm in New Mexico, with, uh,
with Dr. Sandoz.

32:14.700 --> 32:17.300
Does he have the artifact?

32:17.900 --> 32:24.400
Mulder, this, uh, artifact if I'm to
believe what I'm being told about it...

32:24.400 --> 32:26.400
What?

32:26.700 --> 32:30.100
It has a passage on
it from Genesis.

32:30.100 --> 32:34.000
- Scully, that artifact is extraterrestrial.
- Mulder, it can't be.

32:34.000 --> 32:37.100
- Did you know what that would mean?
- No, it would mean nothing, Mulder.

32:37.100 --> 32:41.200
No, it would mean that our progenitors
were alien, that our genesis was alien, ...

32:41.200 --> 32:43.300
...that we're here because of them;
that they put us here.

32:43.300 --> 32:46.500
Mulder, that is science fiction.
It doesn't hold a drop of water.

32:46.500 --> 32:48.100
You're wrong.
It holds everything.

32:48.100 --> 32:52.900
Don't you see? All the mysteries of science everything
we can't understand or won't explain, ...

32:52.900 --> 32:56.000
...every human behaviorism;
cosmology, psychology, ...

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
...everything in the X-Files,
it all owes to them. It's from them.

32:59.000 --> 33:03.200
Mulder, I will not accept that.
It is just not possible.

33:03.200 --> 33:07.000
Well, then, you go ahead and
prove me wrong, Scully.

33:30.300 --> 33:33.900
Yes, it's Diana Fowley
calling for him.

33:36.800 --> 33:40.300
I received a call from
Agent Mulder this evening.

33:40.300 --> 33:44.300
He was in a particular
state of distress.

33:45.100 --> 33:50.500
I don't know why, but I'm
staying here until I find out.

33:56.500 --> 34:01.400
...final preparations for mass destruction
on a scale that can only be imagined.

34:01.400 --> 34:03.000
Well, what can we do to stop it?

34:03.000 --> 34:05.800
There appears to be nothing
we can do to prevent it.

34:05.800 --> 34:12.500
It becomes a question of managing the crisis.
Otherwise, we are facing annihilation ourselves.

34:15.500 --> 34:19.000
It began with an act of
supreme violence.

34:19.000 --> 34:25.699
A big bang expanding ever outward,
cosmos born of matter and gas, ...

34:25.699 --> 34:31.199
...matter and gas ten
billion years ago.

34:31.199 --> 34:33.600
Whose idea was this?

34:33.600 --> 34:36.800
Who had the audacity for
such invention?

34:36.800 --> 34:39.500
And the reason?

34:39.500 --> 34:44.000
Were we part of that plan
ten billion years ago?

34:44.000 --> 34:46.900
Are we born only to die?

34:46.900 --> 34:53.000
To be fruitful and multiply and replenish the
earth before giving way to our generations?

34:53.000 --> 34:58.700
If there is a beginning,
must there be an end?

35:01.100 --> 35:06.200
We burn like fires in our time
only to be extinguished.

35:06.200 --> 35:09.600
To surrender to the elements'
eternal reclaim.

35:09.600 --> 35:13.400
Matter and gas...

35:13.400 --> 35:16.000
...will this all end one day?

35:16.000 --> 35:19.500
Life no longer passing to life, ...

35:19.500 --> 35:26.700
...the Earth left barren like the
stars above, like the cosmos.

35:26.700 --> 35:30.400
Will the hand that lit the flame
let it burn down?

35:30.400 --> 35:35.500
Let it burn out?
Could we, too, become extinct?

35:35.500 --> 35:41.500
Or if this fire of life living inside us is
meant to go on, who decides?

35:41.500 --> 35:44.300
Who tends the flames?

35:44.300 --> 35:50.700
Can he reignite the spark even
as it grows cold and weak?

35:57.500 --> 35:59.800
The healing ceremony has begun
if you want to go inside.

35:59.800 --> 36:03.400
No, I, uh, I don't think
that's right.

36:03.400 --> 36:08.200
- I don't share in their faith.
- The medical doctors say they've done everything they could.

36:08.200 --> 36:12.200
I know. I think they have.

36:12.800 --> 36:14.800
I'm sorry.

36:18.100 --> 36:19.700
Scully.

36:19.700 --> 36:21.300
It's Skinner.
Where are you?

36:21.300 --> 36:24.100
- I'm with Dr. Sandoz.
- Where?

36:24.100 --> 36:26.700
In Gallup, New Mexico.
Where are you?

36:26.700 --> 36:28.800
A hospital in Georgetown.
I'm calling with some bad news.

36:28.800 --> 36:31.500
- Mulder's in serious condition here.
- What happened to him?

36:31.500 --> 36:35.900
Nobody knows, Agent Scully. You should do
whatever you can to get here as soon as possible.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.300
I have to go.
I have to leave.

36:38.300 --> 36:42.100
Please, don't let anyone
know where I am...

36:42.100 --> 36:45.300
Until we know for sure.

36:53.400 --> 36:56.900
GEORGETOWN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL
WASHINGTON, DC

37:09.700 --> 37:12.600
They just told me he's in the
special psychiatric unit.

37:12.600 --> 37:15.000
- I told you on the phone...
- No, you said that there was bad news.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.200
You didn't tell me what
was wrong.

37:18.500 --> 37:22.000
Look, I'm sorry. It just took me
three flights to get here.

37:22.000 --> 37:25.600
I don't know what to do, Dana.
No one else does, either.

37:25.600 --> 37:29.800
I knew you'd want to be here to
see him, to talk to the doctors.

37:33.300 --> 37:35.000
What?

37:35.000 --> 37:37.500
What is it?

37:45.700 --> 37:50.000
Thank you for coming.
He was asking for you last night.

37:59.700 --> 38:02.400
- You really shouldn't be in here.
- What's wrong with him?

38:02.400 --> 38:05.700
This man right here, Fox Mulder?

38:08.700 --> 38:12.400
We don't know what's wrong with him
and we don't know what to do for him.

38:12.400 --> 38:16.300
He's got extremely abnormal brain function
but there is no signs of stroke.

38:16.300 --> 38:18.600
- We're waiting to run more tests.
- Waiting for what?

38:18.600 --> 38:22.200
He's extremely violent. With what we've given
him he should be in a barbiturate coma...

38:22.200 --> 38:25.300
...but there's brain activity in
areas we've never seen before.

38:25.300 --> 38:28.000
- I want to talk to him.
- No, he's a danger to anyone.

38:28.000 --> 38:31.700
- Not to me.
- Can we speak in the hall?

38:31.700 --> 38:34.100
About what?

38:35.100 --> 38:37.500
Agent Scully.

38:54.200 --> 38:56.500
When did all this start?

38:56.500 --> 39:01.300
When we took this case... when
Skinner gave it to us.

39:02.900 --> 39:05.800
- What kind of case is it?
- Investigation into a murder.

39:05.800 --> 39:06.900
Of whom?

39:06.900 --> 39:09.700
The case has nothing to do with
what's happened to him.

39:09.700 --> 39:12.000
Agent Scully says it does.

39:12.000 --> 39:15.700
Now, you know my background, my previous work
on the X-Files. If I can help on this case...

39:15.700 --> 39:19.300
The X-File here is a fraud.
Scully has ample proof of that.

39:19.300 --> 39:23.400
Evidence authenticated by a
scholar and authority.

39:23.800 --> 39:26.400
I never sent you that report.

39:26.400 --> 39:29.400
Anyway, the case is being resolved.

39:29.400 --> 39:32.700
Not as far as it affects
Agent Mulder.

39:32.700 --> 39:35.200
If you know what's happening,
why won't you tell me?

39:35.200 --> 39:37.300
Why were you with him last night?

39:37.300 --> 39:40.300
He called me. I found him in
a university stairwell.

39:40.300 --> 39:42.100
He could barely speak.

39:42.100 --> 39:47.600
He said I was the only one who'd
believe him, ... about an artifact.

39:48.400 --> 39:51.200
You're a liar.

39:51.400 --> 39:54.000
Scully!

39:56.000 --> 39:59.400
You're both liars.

41:42.800 --> 41:43.900
Hello.

41:43.900 --> 41:46.100
Agent Scully, Dr. Sandoz.

41:46.100 --> 41:48.000
I'm sorry, I didn't know
how else to reach you.

41:48.000 --> 41:51.700
- There's something...
- Dr. Sandoz, I-I don't know if this is a secure line.

41:51.700 --> 41:54.300
Yes, all right, but I
realized something.

41:54.300 --> 41:58.200
The letters Albert translated on the
artifact... I know what they are.

41:58.200 --> 42:01.300
- What they are?
- Yes. They're coordinates, Agent Scully.

42:01.300 --> 42:02.400
For what?

42:02.400 --> 42:08.900
For genes. They're symbols for
gene clusters... the human genome.

42:08.900 --> 42:10.700
- Are you there?
- Yeah.

42:10.700 --> 42:12.200
I think it's all here.

42:12.200 --> 42:16.900
The map to our human genetic makeup
every gene on every chromosome.

42:16.900 --> 42:23.000
Proof of what I've been saying.
If only we could find more pieces.

42:26.600 --> 42:29.200
Dr. Sandoz?

42:29.400 --> 42:31.400
Hello?

42:36.000 --> 42:38.500
Dr. Sandoz?

42:53.200 --> 42:56.000
IVORY COAST
36 HOURS LATER

43:04.700 --> 43:06.200
It's the same.

43:06.200 --> 43:09.600
I'll take you, but they are afraid.
