WEBVTT

00:08.189 --> 00:09.550
Impressive.

00:11.550 --> 00:13.750
This is our central control room

00:14.550 --> 00:15.750
and this

00:16.550 --> 00:18.750
is our shield generator control.

00:18.950 --> 00:23.110
<i>The austerity of the facility suggests
that it was built during the height of war.</i>

00:23.150 --> 00:25.150
It is well beyond our science.

00:25.190 --> 00:27.150
My skills are rudimentary at best.

00:27.190 --> 00:29.150
Oh, don't be so hard on yourself.

00:29.190 --> 00:33.350
It took Dr. McKay years to figure
out all things Ancient, and he still
doesn't completely understand 'em.

00:33.390 --> 00:35.950
I have a very firm grasp on Ancient technology.

00:35.990 --> 00:39.350
- You've blown up entire planets, Rodney.
<i>- That wasn't my fault.</i>

00:39.390 --> 00:42.350
- Well, it didn't do it by itself.
<i>- Are these our guests?</i>

00:42.550 --> 00:44.110
Yes, Chancellor.

00:44.750 --> 00:46.670
Lieutenant colonel John Sheppard,

00:46.790 --> 00:50.550
<i>Dr. Rodney McKay, Teyla Emmagan and Ronon Dex.</i>

00:50.950 --> 00:52.350
Chancellor Lycus.

00:52.390 --> 00:53.950
Welcome to Taranis.

00:53.990 --> 00:54.710
Thank you.

00:54.750 --> 00:57.150
And thank you for finally
answering our calls for assistance.

00:57.190 --> 01:03.550
We tried several addresses from the database, but
we were beginning to wonder if anyone could hear us.

01:03.950 --> 01:06.590
Sorry about that.
We like to keep a low profile.

01:06.950 --> 01:09.270
So as not to attract the attention of the Wraith.

01:09.590 --> 01:10.510
I see.

01:10.550 --> 01:12.550
Well, hopefully you can help us.

01:12.750 --> 01:16.150
Our shield generator has been
giving us trouble for some time now. Our...

01:16.190 --> 01:17.950
knowledge of the technology is limited

01:17.990 --> 01:22.150
and the Ancestors regrettably neglected
to leave behind the instruction manuals.

01:22.350 --> 01:23.350
Actually, they did.

01:23.390 --> 01:27.150
- You probably just couldn't underst...
- The good news is, you found our address.

01:27.190 --> 01:29.790
I'm sure we can fix whatever needs fixing.

01:29.830 --> 01:32.510
And by "we", he means me, so...

01:32.870 --> 01:34.550
shall we get started?

01:35.750 --> 01:38.950
I'm sure I could learn a lot from you, Doctor.

01:41.950 --> 01:44.550
I'm sure I can learn...

01:46.950 --> 01:48.550
let's start here, shall we?

01:49.950 --> 01:53.110
In the meantime, perhaps
you'd like a tour of the facility?

01:53.150 --> 01:54.110
Lead the way.

02:01.350 --> 02:02.550
My ears just popped.

02:02.590 --> 02:04.350
We are deep underground.

02:04.390 --> 02:09.550
The Ancestors constructed an extensive
system of corridors and tunnels
throughout the facility and beyond.

02:09.590 --> 02:14.950
In fact, it was by following such a tunnel beneath our
nearest settlement that we discovered this facility.

02:20.950 --> 02:23.030
- What was that?
- Oh, just a tremor.

02:23.070 --> 02:25.550
Nothing to be concerned with.
Please, this way.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.550
Those are harmonic tremors.

02:31.590 --> 02:34.710
We've experienced several
such tremors in recent days.

02:34.750 --> 02:37.470
I'm concerned they may have something
to do with our generator problems.

02:37.510 --> 02:39.550
Well, you say your generator
is powered by geothermal energy.

02:39.590 --> 02:40.350
Yes.

02:40.550 --> 02:42.150
Well, then I'd say there's probably a connection.

02:42.190 --> 02:43.950
What were you doing?

02:43.990 --> 02:46.670
Oh, that, that was
the standard military procedure

02:46.710 --> 02:48.550
in the case of an earthquake, one hides...

02:48.590 --> 02:50.590
well, stands, in a doorway, and

02:50.630 --> 02:54.510
just checks the structural integrity of...
of the building for...

02:54.550 --> 02:56.150
sake of the civilians.

02:57.350 --> 02:58.750
This is the main hangar.

02:58.790 --> 03:00.350
Hangar, for what?

03:00.950 --> 03:03.350
Mere description would be inadequate.

04:36.470 --> 04:39.750
It's an Aurora class warship.
Obviously, the Ancients built more than one of them.

04:39.790 --> 04:42.750
Why didn't we become aware of it at the same
time our sensors picked up the Aurora?

04:42.790 --> 04:45.110
It's damaged.
Probably from the war with the Wraith.

04:45.270 --> 04:46.830
- Beyond repair?
- I don't know.

04:46.870 --> 04:52.150
Their scientists, or at least the folks
who call themselves scientists, have been working
on it for years, but it's way out of their league.

04:52.190 --> 04:55.150
They know how to turn things on and off,
but as far as fixing problems...

04:55.190 --> 04:58.270
Rodney should still have the technical specs
you brought back from the Aurora mission.

04:58.310 --> 05:03.310
I told him to take a look at 'em, but first,
I want him to fix the shield generator,
build some goodwill with these people.

05:03.350 --> 05:04.350
Good idea.

05:04.550 --> 05:06.950
Hopefully we can establish an alliance with them.

05:07.550 --> 05:08.550
A ship like that...

05:08.590 --> 05:12.350
Would come very much in handy now that
Wraith are probably on the way. I know.

05:13.950 --> 05:17.550
I'm gonna get back there now,
make sure he's not distracted, so...

05:17.590 --> 05:18.750
Distracted?

05:19.150 --> 05:22.350
Well, the lead scientist, she's very...

05:22.750 --> 05:23.750
Hot?

05:23.790 --> 05:25.550
I was gonna say attractive,

05:25.590 --> 05:28.150
but McKay is acting very...

05:28.350 --> 05:29.550
Smitten?

05:29.950 --> 05:31.670
I was gonna say pathetic.

05:31.710 --> 05:32.550
<i>Wait.</i>

05:32.590 --> 05:36.350
I should head back with you and begin
negotiations with the taranian leader.

05:36.390 --> 05:37.550
What's he like?

05:38.350 --> 05:39.910
You know, he's a guy.

05:39.950 --> 05:41.150
I didn't pay much attention.

05:41.190 --> 05:41.950
Sorry.

05:46.950 --> 05:51.630
A shield like this would normally require
a Zero Point Module to power it, but

05:51.670 --> 05:55.750
this one seems to operate
on geothermal energy alone.

05:55.790 --> 05:58.750
Yes. There's an enormous amount
of heat beneath the surface.

06:00.150 --> 06:01.350
You're telling me.

06:02.550 --> 06:08.030
When I noticed the fluctuations in
shield strength, I managed to override
the alarms and make some adjustments,

06:08.070 --> 06:11.750
but then other lights began blinking,
I was unable to understand what they meant.

06:11.790 --> 06:14.350
Shortly after that is when the tremors started.

06:14.390 --> 06:15.350
<i>How goes it, Rodney?</i>

06:15.390 --> 06:17.710
I was just still running diagnostics.

06:17.750 --> 06:18.470
Still?

06:18.510 --> 06:19.950
I thought you would have had that fixed.

06:19.990 --> 06:21.630
If you want,

06:21.670 --> 06:25.350
- I can call Dr. Zelenka. I'm sure he could...
- I can handle it, thank you.

06:27.750 --> 06:30.950
What are you doing back so soon?
I mean, I told you this might take some time.

06:31.550 --> 06:33.630
Elizabeth wanted to talk to the Chancellor,

06:33.750 --> 06:36.950
see if we can establish
relations with these good people.

06:37.150 --> 06:38.550
That would be wonderful.

06:40.150 --> 06:42.550
In fact, you've been working awfully hard, maybe I...

06:42.790 --> 06:45.950
No, no, no.
I was just about to show Norina the generator log,

06:45.990 --> 06:47.750
which shows that...

06:48.150 --> 06:51.750
you've been running the shield
continuously for over a year now.

06:51.790 --> 06:55.070
Yes. When the device was activated,
you told me what it was called...

06:55.110 --> 06:56.950
Those are long-range scanners.
That's just what we call them.

06:56.990 --> 06:59.350
- It's from an old TV show.
- Yes, yes, what about them?

06:59.390 --> 07:02.430
When they indicated
a sudden rise in Wraith activity last year,

07:02.470 --> 07:05.310
Chancellor Lycus ordered me
to increase the strength of the shield.

07:05.350 --> 07:07.550
Well, that's unfortunate.

07:08.150 --> 07:09.350
Why?

07:09.390 --> 07:13.950
Because the Ancients didn't design these things
to run continuously at maximum capacity.

07:14.350 --> 07:18.150
Look, shields are for emergencies only, Norina.

07:18.190 --> 07:22.550
When you shut down the alarms, you overrode
the failsafes, and that means that we're...

07:24.550 --> 07:25.750
Oh no.

07:26.150 --> 07:27.150
What is it?

07:28.150 --> 07:29.390
The reason

07:29.430 --> 07:32.750
the Ancients chose to power
this facility on geothermal energy

07:32.790 --> 07:33.910
is because we're sitting

07:33.950 --> 07:38.590
right smack in the caldera of a dormant
super volcano, or should I say formerly dormant,

07:38.630 --> 07:43.150
because drawing all this energy from the
magma chamber has made it extremely active.

07:43.350 --> 07:44.350
So...

07:44.870 --> 07:46.110
things are going to get worse.

07:46.150 --> 07:48.350
I think we could safely say that
things are going to get...

07:48.950 --> 07:49.750
worse.

07:51.350 --> 07:52.150
Yes.

07:54.550 --> 07:59.030
We are seeking to establish relations
with civilizations throughout the galaxy.

07:59.070 --> 08:00.070
As are we.

08:00.110 --> 08:05.550
In fact, people from several worlds have chosen
to immigrate here, seeking refuge from the Wraith.

08:05.590 --> 08:08.350
Our interest extends beyond just security, though.

08:08.390 --> 08:12.550
We're also interested in cultural exchange
and of course, trading opportunities.

08:12.750 --> 08:16.350
As you discovered, we have an extensive
knowledge of Ancient technology.

08:16.390 --> 08:18.550
And we have an Ancient warship.

08:21.350 --> 08:22.350
Yes...

08:22.390 --> 08:24.750
a ship that currently is unable to fly.

08:24.790 --> 08:26.190
If we were able to repair it,

08:26.230 --> 08:30.350
- perhaps we could negotiate...
- We do not know all of its wonders,

08:30.390 --> 08:34.950
but I can only assume it possesses
the capability for great destruction.

08:36.830 --> 08:40.350
Why would I hand over that capability to you?

08:41.230 --> 08:45.550
Now, Chancellor, don't take this as a threat
in any way, but we already possess that capability.

08:45.590 --> 08:48.950
Now, having that ability and using it
are two entirely different things.

08:48.990 --> 08:49.950
<i>Elizabeth?</i>

08:49.990 --> 08:51.750
Excuse me, please.

08:51.790 --> 08:53.150
Yes, John?

08:53.950 --> 08:57.150
<i>You and the Chancellor may want
to come to the control room.</i>

08:57.830 --> 08:59.150
<i>We have a problem.</i>

08:59.190 --> 09:00.150
What kind of problem?

09:06.550 --> 09:08.150
<i>That kind of problem!</i>

09:12.270 --> 09:13.670
I don't see any volcano.

09:13.710 --> 09:16.310
Because you're standing inside it right now.

09:16.350 --> 09:20.790
Look, when you think of regular volcanoes,
you think mount St. Helens, or Kilauea.

09:20.830 --> 09:23.790
- And a super volcano?
- Yellowstone national park,

09:23.830 --> 09:29.350
with a caldera over 50 miles wide and
a massive sea of molten rock just beneath the surface.

09:29.550 --> 09:33.750
So the Ancients built the facility here in order
to tap into all that geothermal energy.

09:33.790 --> 09:35.910
Right. These things don't erupt very often.

09:35.950 --> 09:38.950
Thousands, oftentimes hundreds of
thousands of years go by between blasts.

09:39.070 --> 09:42.030
So the Ancients thought, what the hell,
plenty of energy down there to run a shield.

09:42.070 --> 09:43.750
But not continuously.

09:43.790 --> 09:46.550
By doing so, we've increased
the pressure of the magma chamber.

09:46.590 --> 09:49.750
It's expanded to over 40 miles now, and increasing.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.110
- Can it be stopped?
<i>- No.</i>

09:51.190 --> 09:52.550
The damage is already done.

09:52.590 --> 09:54.910
Look, a significant hotspot rift has opened.

09:54.950 --> 09:58.750
The pressure will keep building as magma
continues pouring in directly beneath us.

09:59.270 --> 10:02.150
Is there anything we can do to relieve
the pressure somewhere else?

10:02.190 --> 10:06.150
Maybe we can fire a drone down into
the crust on the other side of the caldera.

10:06.190 --> 10:09.750
Every problem has a military
solution in your world, doesn't it?

10:09.790 --> 10:12.550
Look, when this baby goes, the whole thing goes.

10:12.590 --> 10:14.550
Then we need to evacuate your people.

10:15.150 --> 10:17.350
Is there anywhere on this planet
we can help relocate you to?

10:17.390 --> 10:21.150
Look, you're still not getting it.
Listen to me, all of you.

10:21.190 --> 10:27.750
When this thing erupts, the force of the explosion
will be over 10,000 times greater than
the blast that destroyed mount St. Helens.

10:27.790 --> 10:31.750
- It will obliterate half of this continent.
- There must be other continents.

10:31.790 --> 10:34.350
<i>The dust cloud will envelop the planet within weeks,</i>

10:34.390 --> 10:37.550
blocking out enough
sunlight to kill every living thing.

10:37.750 --> 10:41.150
We are talking about an extinction level event.

10:42.150 --> 10:43.320
<i>Look, the only option you've got</i>

10:43.725 --> 10:48.751
 is to evacuate your people to another planet,
and I would advise doing it sooner rather than later.

10:51.150 --> 10:52.350
Excuse me.

10:55.150 --> 10:56.550
Watch them carefully.

10:58.350 --> 10:59.150
Oh, I'm sorry.

10:59.190 --> 11:01.150
Was my volume turned right down?

11:01.190 --> 11:02.750
Did he not hear me?

11:22.270 --> 11:23.630
Chancellor Lycus,

11:24.190 --> 11:27.350
Dr. McKay is the finest scientist we have.

11:27.550 --> 11:31.350
- I trust his advice without reservation.
- And I don't know you.

11:31.670 --> 11:33.910
You asked for our help, and we came.

11:33.950 --> 11:37.310
To fix our shield generator,
not incite evacuation of our planet.

11:37.350 --> 11:40.550
Your shield generator is what's causing this problem.

11:41.350 --> 11:45.550
Now, we would not advise such drastic
measures unless there were no other alternatives.

11:45.590 --> 11:51.150
I'm just finding it curious that you advise us
to leave this planet shortly after you discover
that we possess an ancient warship.

11:51.190 --> 11:54.150
You think we're trying to get you
to leave so we can take your ship?

11:54.190 --> 11:55.350
As I said,

11:55.390 --> 11:56.950
I don't know you.

11:56.990 --> 11:58.550
No, you don't.

12:12.550 --> 12:13.750
Is everyone alright?

12:14.350 --> 12:15.870
Nasty cut on his forehead.

12:15.910 --> 12:18.150
Reports of the wounded are
coming in from the settlement.

12:18.190 --> 12:19.950
I'll call Beckett, get him up here.

12:19.990 --> 12:21.070
<i>You'd better make it quick.</i>

12:21.110 --> 12:24.950
The last tremor opened a hydrothermal vent in the base.
The ground is eroding beneath us.

12:25.190 --> 12:28.350
You need to get your people off this planet now.

12:29.750 --> 12:31.150
They can come to Atlantis.

12:31.190 --> 12:32.550
They'll be safe there.

12:33.950 --> 12:38.150
If we didn't answer your call for help,
this would still be happening.

12:38.550 --> 12:40.950
Chancellor, please listen to them.

12:44.910 --> 12:46.150
Alert the settlers.

12:46.190 --> 12:50.750
<i>Tell our people to gather only their most precious
possessions and come here as quickly as possible.</i>

12:50.790 --> 12:53.350
We'll begin evacuating immediately.

12:54.350 --> 12:55.350
Good.

12:56.550 --> 12:58.150
Teyla, Ronon, come in.

13:03.550 --> 13:04.710
Oh, good, you're here.

13:04.750 --> 13:07.030
We're just about ready to escort
the first wave back to Atlantis.

13:07.070 --> 13:07.950
Where are the wounded?

13:07.990 --> 13:11.670
There's a technician up in the control room
that needs tending to. They're also bringing
in more wounded from the settlement.

13:11.710 --> 13:12.750
What can we do?

13:12.790 --> 13:15.070
You can help colonel Sheppard
facilitate the flow of evacuees.

13:15.110 --> 13:17.950
Chancellor Lycus and I are going
to handle their arrival on the other end.

13:17.990 --> 13:18.950
This way, Carson.

13:23.550 --> 13:24.350
<i>Rodney?</i>

13:24.550 --> 13:25.350
Right here.

13:29.950 --> 13:31.750
Gate's dialed. You're good to go.

13:38.230 --> 13:41.550
<i>Alright, we'll see you on the other side.
Please make it quick.</i>

13:54.150 --> 13:56.750
Sheppard, the first wave's on its way.

13:56.950 --> 13:58.350
How you doing with the next group?

13:58.950 --> 14:00.350
<i>Keep the line moving.</i>

14:10.950 --> 14:13.750
Sheppard, get those people back inside the facility!

14:13.790 --> 14:17.150
Atlantis, this is McKay. Raise the shield!
I repeat, raise the shield!

14:28.350 --> 14:29.750
The Stargate...

14:31.750 --> 14:32.750
It's gone.

14:48.750 --> 14:49.750
Why did you raise the shields?

14:49.790 --> 14:52.150
McKay gave the order just before we lost contact.

14:54.750 --> 14:56.110
What is happening?

14:56.150 --> 14:57.150
I don't know.

15:01.550 --> 15:02.950
Run a Gate diagnostic.

15:02.990 --> 15:06.430
Power levels were intermittent
the last few seconds before it shut off.

15:06.470 --> 15:08.550
Something must have terminated
the connection from their end.

15:08.590 --> 15:09.750
Dial them back.

15:14.950 --> 15:18.150
Can't establish a wormhole.
Something's happened to their Stargate.

15:18.350 --> 15:21.150
There's nothing wrong with our Gate.
Dial it again.

15:24.750 --> 15:25.950
I'm getting nothing.

15:26.550 --> 15:29.070
- You orchestrated this, didn't you?
- What?

15:29.110 --> 15:32.350
You lured me here to hold me hostage
in exchange for our warship.

15:32.390 --> 15:35.350
I assure you, Chancellor, that is
not what's happening here.

15:35.390 --> 15:39.950
Zelenka, the Daedalus is on its way back
from Earth. I want you to contact colonel
Caldwell and divert them to Taranis.

15:39.990 --> 15:40.950
Right away.

15:41.670 --> 15:45.640
- We're going to find out what's going on, I promise.
- I will not be cut off from my people.

15:45.670 --> 15:47.990
My people are on your planet too, Chancellor.

15:48.030 --> 15:49.350
We're both cut off.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.110
What the hell happened?

15:52.150 --> 15:54.270
<i>The Stargate.</i>
It was swallowed up by the magma.

15:54.310 --> 15:56.350
- We are so screwed.
<i>- You mean we're stuck here?</i>

15:56.390 --> 15:59.630
- If we have no way of contacting Atlantis...
- We are totally screwed.

15:59.670 --> 16:00.950
Hang on, let's not panic.

16:00.990 --> 16:05.590
- This facility has no means of
direct subspace communication.
- Will you just take it easy?

16:05.630 --> 16:07.590
We're inside a
soon-to-be-erupting volcano!

16:07.630 --> 16:10.470
Elizabeth will try to dial us
back. When she can't get through,

16:10.750 --> 16:12.230
she'll send the Daedalus.

16:12.270 --> 16:13.590
Daedalus. Right.

16:14.030 --> 16:15.270
That's good.

16:16.070 --> 16:18.350
What if the volcano erupts before then?

16:19.350 --> 16:20.630
The ship in the hangar.

16:21.030 --> 16:22.510
Maybe McKay can fix it.

16:22.550 --> 16:26.590
Oh, maybe I can fix it. Place the pressure
squarely on my shoulders for a change!

16:26.630 --> 16:30.550
Well, I've discovered you're pretty
good under the threat of impending death.

16:34.550 --> 16:35.950
I am, actually.

16:46.150 --> 16:46.950
<i>Okay.</i>

16:46.990 --> 16:47.830
And

16:47.870 --> 16:49.350
primary power

16:49.390 --> 16:50.350
is

16:51.430 --> 16:52.550
online.

17:01.390 --> 17:03.750
I wonder how many more ships like these exist.

17:03.790 --> 17:06.750
<i>A few more of these, and we can
give the Wraith a serious fight.</i>

17:07.790 --> 17:10.190
Life support should be back up
and running in a few minutes.

17:10.270 --> 17:11.750
Good. That's good.

17:11.910 --> 17:15.270
And I have discovered the ship's name.

17:16.550 --> 17:19.030
It's the Hippaforalkus.

17:19.670 --> 17:20.470
The what?

17:20.510 --> 17:24.030
Yeah, well, it appears to have
been named after an Ancient general.

17:24.829 --> 17:26.069
Hippaforalkus.

17:26.109 --> 17:27.510
Well, we're not calling it that.

17:27.550 --> 17:31.990
- Oh, good, then what about...
- And we're not calling it the Enterprise, either.

17:32.030 --> 17:33.310
I wasn't going to say that.

17:33.350 --> 17:36.350
- For my second choice, though...
- How about we name it later?

17:36.990 --> 17:37.870
Fine.

17:37.910 --> 17:41.910
Whatever its name, this ship is
large enough to fit many people.

17:41.950 --> 17:45.150
- It could fit all the settlement if we had to.
- Let's hope we don't have to.

17:45.190 --> 17:47.110
<i>Colonel Sheppard, this is the Daedalus.</i>

17:47.550 --> 17:48.350
Go ahead.

17:49.990 --> 17:53.230
<i>The signal's having trouble breaking through.
We're gonna have to boost it.</i>

17:53.350 --> 17:55.110
Can you get communications online?

17:55.150 --> 17:56.630
Right. I'm on it.

18:03.030 --> 18:04.950
Alright, try it now.

18:05.070 --> 18:07.070
Yes, Sir, we're here.
Where are you?

18:07.150 --> 18:09.750
We just arrived in orbit above Taranis.
Where are you?

18:09.790 --> 18:11.750
We've scanned the base and found no life signs.

18:11.790 --> 18:13.910
Well, this part of the base must be shielded.

18:13.950 --> 18:15.670
<i>I hear you could use some assistance?</i>

18:15.870 --> 18:22.150
The Stargate on this planet's been swallowed by lava,
and we're in a volcano that could erupt any second,
so, yeah, yeah, we could use a little help.

18:22.190 --> 18:24.630
Get yourselves out in the open
where we can get a lock on you.

18:24.670 --> 18:27.230
<i>No, Sir, we promised to help these people.</i>

18:27.270 --> 18:29.950
We're gonna need Daedalus
to evac them back to Atlantis.

18:29.990 --> 18:33.550
From the number of people that we're
detecting, that's at least four trips.

18:33.670 --> 18:36.990
But the Daedalus is quite large.
<i>Surely you could fit more.</i>

18:37.030 --> 18:40.870
This is a spaceship, which means that our
life support resources are finite.

18:40.910 --> 18:43.910
<i>Four trips would already stretch
those resources to the limit.</i>

18:43.950 --> 18:45.270
Do we have enough time for that?

18:45.310 --> 18:47.630
There's no way to know for sure.
I mean, it'll be close.

18:47.670 --> 18:49.470
Well, the tremors have stopped.

18:49.510 --> 18:50.470
For the moment.

18:50.510 --> 18:53.070
Beckett's on his way back to the
settlement to treat the wounded.

18:53.110 --> 18:55.950
Teyla and Ronon can join him, organize
people into groups that can be beamed aboard.

18:55.990 --> 18:59.110
In the mean time McKay and I are going to
stay here and continue our work on plan B.

18:59.150 --> 19:00.830
No, no, no, we need to get out of here.

19:00.870 --> 19:04.470
We can start the process, but if things get worse
and the Daedalus can't get everyone offworld,

19:04.510 --> 19:06.190
we're going to need another lifeboat.

19:06.470 --> 19:08.230
And plan B is what?

19:08.270 --> 19:10.390
<i>We found a sister ship to the Aurora</i>

19:10.550 --> 19:11.630
called the...

19:12.110 --> 19:13.430
Orion.

19:14.910 --> 19:17.430
McKay's trying to get the sublight drive online.

19:17.590 --> 19:18.510
<i>Really?</i>

19:19.190 --> 19:22.270
Well, a ship that large, you should be
able to get everyone else out in one trip.

19:22.310 --> 19:25.550
Yeah, well, whether or not we
live or die is all up to Rodney.

19:25.590 --> 19:27.470
This is so unfair.

19:28.310 --> 19:29.830
Sounds like a plan, Colonel.

19:29.870 --> 19:31.070
Let's get to it.

19:37.950 --> 19:39.590
Right, over there you go.

19:39.790 --> 19:41.790
Have you selected which patients will go first?

19:41.830 --> 19:43.870
Aye, this group here.
They're the most severely wounded.

19:43.910 --> 19:46.470
I've alerted the Daedalus' infirmary.
They're waiting for them.

19:46.790 --> 19:49.630
Ronon is outside gathering
the remainder of the first group.

19:49.750 --> 19:52.790
Everyone has seen and felt the first
signs of the impending eruption,

19:52.830 --> 19:56.270
and despite our best efforts to keep
them calm, some are beginning to panic.

19:56.310 --> 19:58.230
How long before
the Daedalus is able to return?

19:58.270 --> 20:00.590
12 hours to travel to Atlantis and back.

20:00.630 --> 20:03.590
12 hours and hope there's
enough time to make four trips.

20:04.310 --> 20:05.750
Ronon, this way.

20:06.230 --> 20:07.310
To the far left.

20:07.350 --> 20:08.550
The next group to go.

20:09.190 --> 20:09.750
Alright.

20:09.790 --> 20:10.750
Come here, everyone.

20:11.790 --> 20:13.030
<i>I need you to stay in here.</i>

20:13.070 --> 20:14.950
<i>Come on. Stay in here.</i>

20:15.310 --> 20:17.550
Don't worry, you won't feel a thing.

20:19.150 --> 20:21.390
Daedalus, this is Teyla Emmagan.

20:21.430 --> 20:24.910
We have several hundred Taranians
standing by at the various beaming sites.

20:25.710 --> 20:26.830
We are ready.

20:26.870 --> 20:27.670
<i>Understood.</i>

20:34.790 --> 20:38.110
<i>The first wave of refugees are onboard.
We're headed back to Atlantis.</i>

20:38.150 --> 20:41.590
Thank you, Colonel.
We'll be ready to receive them. Weir out.

20:43.150 --> 20:44.270
Then what?

20:44.310 --> 20:48.190
Once my people have been evacuated
to this city, what happens to us then?

20:48.470 --> 20:50.390
You're welcome to stay here with us,

20:50.590 --> 20:53.990
or we can help you find a safe,
suitable planet you could relocate to.

20:54.030 --> 20:57.590
And if what is happening on
my planet is a false alarm?

20:57.910 --> 20:59.590
I doubt that's the case.

21:00.150 --> 21:03.030
Dr. Weir...
Dr. Weir, I'm sorry, it's important.

21:03.070 --> 21:04.710
Excuse me, Chancellor.

21:06.750 --> 21:08.270
The long range scanner.

21:09.230 --> 21:10.470
A hive ship.

21:10.950 --> 21:13.470
<i>Yes. Headed toward Atlantis.</i>

21:13.790 --> 21:15.070
How far out?

21:15.110 --> 21:16.990
Three weeks, perhaps.

21:17.990 --> 21:19.270
Just the one?

21:19.590 --> 21:20.750
So far.

21:23.350 --> 21:24.510
So far.

21:34.270 --> 21:38.390
I have already learned so much
from you just in the last few hours.

21:39.030 --> 21:41.030
Perhaps one day I could study under you.

21:41.070 --> 21:43.030
Yes, well, I really...

21:43.110 --> 21:45.910
really look forward to that,
but first we need to get off...

21:46.910 --> 21:50.910
First we need to get off the planet.First we need to
get off the planet, and then you can be under me...

22:01.910 --> 22:02.830
Okay, that was a big one.

22:02.910 --> 22:05.590
- That was a lot stronger than the...
- You alright?

22:05.790 --> 22:06.790
I'm fine.

22:11.150 --> 22:12.590
All good under there.

22:13.510 --> 22:14.950
Okay.

22:20.230 --> 22:21.350
What is it?

22:22.190 --> 22:23.790
It's just ash beginning to fall.

22:24.110 --> 22:26.470
Is that a sign that the volcano will soon erupt?

22:26.510 --> 22:28.990
Diastrophism is a wee bit outside my bailiwick.

22:29.470 --> 22:31.310
I mean, no, I doubt it.

22:31.670 --> 22:33.350
Remember what Rodney said.

22:33.390 --> 22:35.190
When she goes, we'll know.

22:35.230 --> 22:38.590
<i>- And who decided that?
- We all did. Everyone's voice was heard.</i>

22:38.630 --> 22:41.350
- What is wrong?
- This is Vonos. He's from another settlement.

22:41.390 --> 22:43.670
- Hello there.
<i>- How long before the Daedalus returns?</i>

22:43.710 --> 22:45.230
<i>Still several hours,</i>

22:45.270 --> 22:48.430
and I'm afraid the second evacuation
group has already been selected,

22:48.470 --> 22:51.230
but you and your people will
be able to leave in the third.

22:51.270 --> 22:54.150
- That won't be necessary.
- He thinks he can outrun this thing.

22:54.550 --> 22:56.630
- What?
- A day's walk from here, there is a river,

22:56.670 --> 22:58.230
wide, calm,

22:58.270 --> 23:00.230
should offer
protection from any lava flow.

23:00.270 --> 23:02.630
- Another two days after that, we're at the sea...
- Listen to me.

23:02.670 --> 23:06.110
There's a cloud of ash spreading across
the sky. If that doesn't choke you to death,

23:06.150 --> 23:07.670
you'll surely die in the explosion.

23:07.710 --> 23:10.510
The only chance of survival
is to evacuate this planet.

23:10.550 --> 23:12.910
And the only way out of here is on our ship.

23:17.470 --> 23:18.550
Time to go.

23:26.110 --> 23:28.470
It's getting a hell of a lot worse out there.

23:28.510 --> 23:31.790
The last tremor opened many more fissures.
We have a problem.

23:34.510 --> 23:35.830
<i>Rodney, come in.</i>

23:36.710 --> 23:37.550
Go ahead.

23:37.590 --> 23:42.550
<i>Looks like there's a lot of new vents, a lot of
ash going into the air headed toward the settlement.</i>

23:42.590 --> 23:45.710
We don't have time to wait for the
Daedalus. How are those engines coming?

23:45.750 --> 23:46.870
I'm not even close.

23:46.910 --> 23:50.310
- Well, then, I guess we're all going to die.
<i>- Oh, you're doing that on purpose!</i>

23:51.390 --> 23:52.310
What?

23:52.350 --> 23:55.350
You're creating an impossible task
that my ego will force me to overcome!

23:55.390 --> 23:57.630
Oh, yes, yes, that's exactly what I'm doing.

23:57.670 --> 24:01.430
It has nothing at all to do with saving the
lives of these people. It's all about you.

24:01.750 --> 24:05.030
Now, get your ass back to
work and fix those damn engines!

24:09.070 --> 24:11.550
He'll fix them, trust me.

24:15.710 --> 24:18.030
Alright, folks, can I have your attention, please?

24:18.070 --> 24:20.590
I'm afraid there's been a change of plans.

24:20.790 --> 24:23.710
We need to bring everyone from
the settlement back to the base.

24:23.750 --> 24:24.790
Once at the base,

24:24.830 --> 24:27.950
we'll board another ship called the Orion.
It's a lovely ship with lots of room for...

24:27.990 --> 24:28.910
Why?

24:28.950 --> 24:32.350
As you can see, the conditions
outside are rapidly deteriorating.

24:32.390 --> 24:35.150
We may not have time to wait
for our ship to return, so

24:35.190 --> 24:39.230
we would like everyone to proceed down
the tunnel that leads back to the base. The Orion

24:39.270 --> 24:43.990
- will safely evacuate everyone before the volcano...
- Why did we not board that ship in the first place?

24:44.030 --> 24:49.310
The engines are not currently in working condition,
but our people are confident they'll have
them fixed before the volcano erupts.

24:49.350 --> 24:51.470
This is why we should not have waited.

24:51.510 --> 24:54.990
We cannot trust what they say.
We must leave this place now.

24:55.310 --> 24:56.590
And go where?

24:57.030 --> 24:59.310
- To the river.
- Have you looked outside, big man?

24:59.350 --> 25:03.630
- The air will be clear beyond the river.
- No, it won't! That cloud stretches for bloody miles!

25:03.950 --> 25:06.350
- You will die out there.
- Maybe.

25:07.470 --> 25:10.830
But it is better to do battle with
death than idly wait for it to take you.

25:13.790 --> 25:15.630
You're all welcome to join us.

25:15.670 --> 25:20.470
No. At least in here, we stand a chance
of survival. Out there, it is suicide.

25:38.790 --> 25:39.830
Alright,

25:40.270 --> 25:41.310
everybody else,

25:41.350 --> 25:42.950
please come this way,

25:43.390 --> 25:44.390
down the tunnel.

26:02.950 --> 26:05.270
Do you know which of these stars is Taranis?

26:05.990 --> 26:08.030
I'm sorry, I don't.

26:10.510 --> 26:12.390
Your city is incredible.

26:14.270 --> 26:15.790
Yes, it is.

26:18.310 --> 26:19.430
Dr. Weir...

26:19.950 --> 26:24.470
<i>your people have been putting their
lives in jeopardy to save my people, and</i>

26:24.510 --> 26:26.990
I have rewarded that kindness with

26:27.030 --> 26:29.190
doubt and suspicion.

26:29.790 --> 26:31.070
I apologize.

26:31.350 --> 26:33.070
That's not necessary.

26:34.350 --> 26:36.430
I understand how you must feel.

26:37.110 --> 26:40.990
I truly believed that the Ancestors'
shield would protect my people.

26:41.430 --> 26:43.350
I could not have been more wrong.

26:43.710 --> 26:45.870
We'll save as many as we can.

26:47.630 --> 26:48.990
I believe you will.

26:53.150 --> 26:55.030
<i>Okay, this way, folks. Hurry, hurry.</i>

26:55.070 --> 26:57.190
Good, good. Keep 'em coming.
Where are Teyla and Ronon?

26:57.230 --> 26:59.670
Still back at the village to gather the rest
of the people. Then they'll be on their way.

26:59.710 --> 27:01.630
Good.
Get these people to the ship.

27:01.670 --> 27:04.470
- Come on, move it. Let's go. Come on.
- Come on, straight down to the hangar, folks.

27:04.510 --> 27:06.270
Ship's waiting, plenty of room.

27:07.910 --> 27:09.070
Don't panic!

27:09.670 --> 27:10.590
There's plenty of room!

27:11.790 --> 27:13.550
- Sheppard.
<i>- What?</i>

27:13.590 --> 27:16.430
<i>I just got the atmospheric sensors
online. I'm reading dangerously high levels</i>

27:16.470 --> 27:19.190
of sulfur dioxide spewing into
the air from dozens of fumaroles.

27:19.230 --> 27:23.030
Look, it is rapidly becoming toxic out there.
Make sure you get people to stick to the tunnels.

27:23.070 --> 27:24.990
We'll pass the word. How about those engines?

27:25.230 --> 27:26.750
I'm still working on that.

27:26.950 --> 27:27.990
Keep me apprised.

27:28.030 --> 27:29.390
<i>Teyla, Ronon.</i>

27:30.710 --> 27:31.910
Yes, Colonel.

27:32.190 --> 27:34.990
<i>We've got toxic gas venting into the atmosphere.</i>

27:35.790 --> 27:36.710
Yes.

27:36.750 --> 27:38.350
It has already made its way here.

27:38.390 --> 27:41.510
Get everyone into the tunnel
underneath the settlement asap.

27:41.630 --> 27:43.070
<i>They are heading your way.</i>

27:43.230 --> 27:45.950
Ronon has found one remaining
family at the edge of the village.

27:45.990 --> 27:48.070
He is returning, and then we will go.

27:52.550 --> 27:54.950
Beckett and Norina
are helping people get on board.

27:54.990 --> 27:57.550
It's getting pretty tense,
but nobody's trampled each other...

27:57.790 --> 27:58.950
yet.

28:01.030 --> 28:02.510
What?

28:02.670 --> 28:04.910
Two large fissures
just opened up near the base.

28:04.950 --> 28:07.310
One of the lava flows just covered
the hangar directly above us.

28:07.350 --> 28:09.390
We're talking over 30 feet thick.

28:09.430 --> 28:10.430
Is the door gonna hold?

28:10.470 --> 28:13.950
I don't know. I, I think so,
but it's, that's not the bigger problem.

28:14.030 --> 28:18.230
Even if I can get the engines fixed,
there is no way to fly this ship out of here.

28:18.270 --> 28:20.030
We're stuck.

28:25.550 --> 28:29.390
Colonel Sheppard, this is Teyla. Please respond.

28:31.110 --> 28:31.990
Colonel...

28:32.150 --> 28:35.390
if you hear me, please respond.

28:36.910 --> 28:38.150
Ronon.

28:41.550 --> 28:42.550
Everyone else get through?

28:42.590 --> 28:44.590
Yes. We are the last to remain.

28:45.310 --> 28:46.870
We'd better get going, then.

28:47.310 --> 28:49.390
Ronon, the tunnel is blocked.

28:49.430 --> 28:52.030
I was just there.
It collapsed during the last tremor.

28:52.270 --> 28:53.470
It'll be alright.

28:57.230 --> 28:58.430
We can't go back out there.

28:58.470 --> 29:01.150
I have been trying to hail colonel Sheppard.

29:01.590 --> 29:02.990
So we're stuck?

29:03.950 --> 29:06.070
It would appear so.

29:13.070 --> 29:14.630
Time for a military solution.

29:14.670 --> 29:15.470
For which problem?

29:15.510 --> 29:18.830
We've got an armory full of drones on board.
Maybe we can blast through the hangar door.

29:18.870 --> 29:22.750
The hangar door is directly above us.
The molten lava would destroy the ship.

29:22.950 --> 29:24.470
Not if I can get the shields operational.

29:24.510 --> 29:26.190
- Tell me you can do that.
- I can do that.

29:26.270 --> 29:29.270
And once they're operational,
they'll be able to provide enough protection to...

29:29.310 --> 29:30.670
<i>- To what?</i>
- Talk amongst yourselves.

29:30.750 --> 29:31.590
<i>- What're you doing?</i>
- I have an idea.

29:31.630 --> 29:33.030
- What kind of idea?
- Can't talk. Busy.

29:33.070 --> 29:34.390
- Just give me a basic..
- Not now, please.

29:34.430 --> 29:36.390
I hate it when he does this.

29:50.510 --> 29:51.790
What are we gonna do?

29:53.270 --> 29:55.150
There is no place to go.

29:56.390 --> 29:59.430
I'm not good at sitting around waiting to die.

30:01.590 --> 30:03.670
Maybe we can make it back to the base on foot.

30:03.790 --> 30:05.270
Outside?

30:05.830 --> 30:07.710
We will never make it.

30:08.390 --> 30:10.670
As long as we can breathe,

30:10.710 --> 30:12.670
there is still hope

30:13.190 --> 30:19.190
and we may be able to last a few
minutes longer in here than out there.

30:25.230 --> 30:27.950
Okay, hurry, ladies and gentlemen.
Right down the hallway there. Thank you.

30:27.990 --> 30:29.110
Carson, how're we doing?

30:29.150 --> 30:32.070
We're just about ready. There should be another
group of refugees coming on board now.

30:32.110 --> 30:33.470
Teyla? Ronon?

30:33.510 --> 30:36.110
They helped the last family.
God, I haven't seen them.

30:36.910 --> 30:38.630
Teyla? Ronon?

30:39.310 --> 30:41.310
Teyla, Ronon, please respond.

30:43.030 --> 30:45.350
- Don't leave without us.
- No, of course not.

30:45.710 --> 30:47.550
Right down there.

30:53.030 --> 30:54.870
They're still alive...

30:55.070 --> 30:56.470
but barely.

30:59.190 --> 31:01.230
Perhaps you were right.

31:02.950 --> 31:06.990
We should have tried
to make it back to the base on foot.

31:07.830 --> 31:08.870
No.

31:09.390 --> 31:11.070
You were right.

31:11.710 --> 31:13.550
We'd be dead.

31:17.350 --> 31:19.830
As long as we can breathe...

31:20.670 --> 31:22.310
there's still hope.

31:31.150 --> 31:33.310
We owe you a debt of gratitude, Colonel.

31:33.350 --> 31:37.230
Frankly, yours were the only
life signs that we could detect on the planet.
What happened to the others?

31:37.430 --> 31:38.990
Sheppard, Beckett, and McKay,

31:39.030 --> 31:41.070
they took the rest of the people back to the base.

31:41.430 --> 31:43.630
- We got cut off from them.
- Well, that's brilliant. The base is shielded.

31:43.670 --> 31:45.270
I can't beam them out of there.

31:45.310 --> 31:48.030
They were attempting to load the rest
of the people on board the Orion,

31:48.070 --> 31:52.270
hoping Dr. McKay would be able to get
the engines working before the eruption.

32:01.990 --> 32:03.710
What are you saying? They're all dead?

32:03.750 --> 32:04.630
<i>We don't know.</i>

32:04.670 --> 32:08.670
One way or the other,
we can't hail them on radio because of
extreme electrical activity in the ash cloud.

32:08.710 --> 32:10.910
We can't even detect their life signs.

32:11.070 --> 32:13.230
So if you make contact, what are your options?

32:13.710 --> 32:16.790
Well, colonel Sheppard could have
saved some of the remaining population,

32:16.830 --> 32:20.270
but instead he tried to save every
single one of them by taking refuge aboard the

32:20.310 --> 32:24.750
damaged ancient warship, which has pretty much
taken any options I might have had out of the equation.

32:26.190 --> 32:27.910
Stay as long as you can.

32:28.590 --> 32:32.310
<i>Hermiod says the volcano's about to erupt.
We should know for sure by then.</i>

32:32.350 --> 32:36.670
Be advised,
we have detected a hive ship heading towards Atlantis.

32:38.990 --> 32:40.590
Just the one?

32:41.630 --> 32:44.230
I'm afraid that's all the good news we have.

32:52.670 --> 32:54.470
Teyla, Ronon, come in.

33:02.110 --> 33:03.150
<i>Stop!</i>

33:03.230 --> 33:05.550
Door's probably hot.
You don't want to touch it.

33:05.670 --> 33:07.470
Let's try this way.

33:09.950 --> 33:11.750
Okay, not that way either.

33:11.910 --> 33:13.270
Rodney, come in.

33:13.750 --> 33:14.590
Go ahead.

33:14.630 --> 33:17.790
<i>I've run into the last group of villagers
and I'm trying to get them back to the ship.</i>

33:17.870 --> 33:21.950
Looks like the base is going to emergency lockdown.
We got doors sealing off everywhere.

33:21.990 --> 33:24.310
We could really use some help
trying to find another way back.

33:24.630 --> 33:25.390
Alright.

33:25.430 --> 33:28.750
I'll have Norina call up
the base schematics, see if she can...

33:37.030 --> 33:38.470
Rodney?

33:39.790 --> 33:40.710
Rodney...

33:41.150 --> 33:43.190
do you copy?

33:45.150 --> 33:46.710
Damn it.

33:55.030 --> 34:00.110
Colonel, I'm attempting to calculate the precise
time remaining before the main eruption.

34:00.550 --> 34:02.110
We should try to land.

34:02.150 --> 34:05.710
<i>The planet's surface is far too unstable
to attempt any landing.</i>

34:05.750 --> 34:08.070
So our only option is to sit here and wait?

34:08.110 --> 34:10.510
<i>There is one other option.</i>

34:10.550 --> 34:11.830
What?

34:12.670 --> 34:14.630
We could leave.

34:15.230 --> 34:17.469
That's not an option we're considering.

34:21.750 --> 34:24.510
I'm starting to smell sulfur dioxide here.

34:24.830 --> 34:28.590
Stay close. Stay calm.
Try not to take too many deep breaths.

34:31.230 --> 34:33.070
Colonel Sheppard, are you there?

34:33.949 --> 34:35.710
Colonel Sheppard, please come in.

34:35.750 --> 34:37.350
- Any luck?
- Not yet.

34:37.389 --> 34:39.030
There's too much interference.

34:39.070 --> 34:42.070
Look, the atmosphere is heavily
charged with electromagnetic energy.

34:42.110 --> 34:43.870
This baby's ready to blow.

34:44.110 --> 34:47.790
The Taranian people are all on board, except for
the last group that colonel Sheppard was escorting.

34:47.830 --> 34:48.830
Teyla and Ronon?

34:48.870 --> 34:50.750
We've lost contact with them as well.

34:52.750 --> 34:53.949
Alright.

35:05.350 --> 35:07.550
Please be the hangar door.

35:10.830 --> 35:12.750
Help me pry this thing open.

35:31.670 --> 35:32.470
This way.

35:37.590 --> 35:38.590
Alright.

35:38.670 --> 35:41.750
Tell the people to get on the floor and secure
themselves. I think the eruption is imminent.

35:41.790 --> 35:43.470
We're just about ready.

35:43.510 --> 35:44.750
<i>Ready for what?</i>

35:46.790 --> 35:47.950
Oh, thank God.

35:47.990 --> 35:49.150
What took you so long?

35:49.190 --> 35:52.070
- Just about ready for what?
- To activate the shields.

35:52.110 --> 35:54.590
I thought you said the blast from the
eruption will wipe out half the continent.

35:54.630 --> 35:57.830
It will, and after 4.1 seconds of those
extreme temperatures and pressures,

35:57.870 --> 35:59.150
our shields will be depleted.

35:59.190 --> 36:01.350
As much as I'm all for
living for another four seconds...

36:01.390 --> 36:05.230
- That's not very much time for anything, Rodney.
- It's plenty of time to open a hyperspace window.

36:06.710 --> 36:08.550
But that's my plan.
Didn't I tell you about that?

36:08.590 --> 36:09.950
- No.
- No, you didn't.

36:10.030 --> 36:13.550
- You were too busy running around looking for people.
- Well, tell us the damn plan.

36:13.590 --> 36:16.390
Fixing the sublight engines was
impossible in the amount of time we had left...

36:16.430 --> 36:17.430
they were just too badly damaged,

36:17.470 --> 36:21.310
but I've devised a sort of a patch that in effect
diverts auxiliary power to the hyperdrive.

36:21.350 --> 36:24.110
- Only enough for a fraction of a second, mind you.
- That won't get us very far.

36:24.150 --> 36:26.430
We don't need to go far.
Any old orbit will do.

36:26.470 --> 36:27.470
And then what?

36:27.630 --> 36:29.270
Well, then Norina and I were planning a

36:29.310 --> 36:30.870
small dinner for us all, nothing fancy, just...

36:30.910 --> 36:32.670
- Rodney...
- Well, what does he mean, "then what?"

36:32.710 --> 36:34.270
Then we won't die horribly?

36:34.310 --> 36:39.750
So your plan is to not blow a hole in
the hangar but to sit here and wait for this
cataclysmic eruption to take place.

36:39.790 --> 36:43.190
With the shields
and inertial dampeners at full strength, yes.

36:43.230 --> 36:45.350
I think I may be missing something.
Correct me if I'm wrong,

36:45.390 --> 36:47.790
but when the volcano erupts, don't we as well?

36:48.030 --> 36:48.710
That's the plan.

36:48.790 --> 36:49.990
- That's the plan?
- That's the plan.

36:50.030 --> 36:51.590
- That plan sucks.
- Aye.

36:51.630 --> 36:56.150
The ship will be ejected along with the magma
and steam several thousand feet into the air.

36:56.510 --> 36:57.590
The ship can survive that?

36:57.630 --> 36:59.550
For exactly 4.1 seconds, yes.

36:59.590 --> 37:02.670
Look, the hangar should disintegrate. The moment
we're clear, we open a brief hyperspace window,

37:02.710 --> 37:06.470
jump to space before the explosion
depletes our shields and incinerates us.

37:07.830 --> 37:09.150
Okay.

37:09.710 --> 37:10.510
What.

37:10.910 --> 37:12.270
That's very clever, Rodney.

37:15.390 --> 37:17.830
Well, don't thank me 'till it works...

37:19.110 --> 37:20.790
which it probably won't.

37:20.830 --> 37:21.470
Excuse me.

37:27.030 --> 37:31.070
Colonel, I believe
the eruption will occur in 52 seconds.

37:31.790 --> 37:32.910
Are you sure?

37:33.350 --> 37:35.670
I would not state it if I wasn't.

37:42.710 --> 37:43.470
What?

37:44.150 --> 37:46.390
Bent my fingernail back.
I hate that.

37:46.430 --> 37:47.830
Yes, that can be painful.

37:47.870 --> 37:49.430
- Yeah, will you look at that?
- Are you done?

37:49.470 --> 37:50.870
Almost. Look,

37:50.910 --> 37:52.110
does anyone have nail clippers?

37:52.150 --> 37:53.070
Rodney...

37:53.350 --> 37:54.990
Not helping.

37:55.070 --> 37:55.870
Alright,

37:56.750 --> 37:57.750
so...

37:57.910 --> 38:01.310
hyperdrive's ready,
inertial dampeners are engaged, shields are up.

38:01.430 --> 38:02.790
We're good to go.

38:05.110 --> 38:07.150
- What?
- Got up too fast.

38:07.710 --> 38:09.230
40 seconds.

38:15.710 --> 38:16.950
Where's the P.A.?

38:16.990 --> 38:18.390
Arm of the chair.

38:20.150 --> 38:24.990
Alright, folks, all chairs and seatbacks into
your upright and locked positions.

38:25.030 --> 38:28.030
Don't hold your breath.
It could happen any time in the next half an hour.

38:47.830 --> 38:48.870
Five...

38:48.910 --> 38:49.910
<i>Four...</i>

38:49.950 --> 38:50.950
<i>Three...</i>

38:51.030 --> 38:52.230
<i>Two...</i>

38:52.270 --> 38:53.390
One.

39:21.790 --> 39:23.150
<i>It worked!</i>

39:24.630 --> 39:26.550
You really are a genius.

39:28.270 --> 39:29.870
<i>Rodney?</i>

39:30.910 --> 39:32.030
I'm good.

39:34.830 --> 39:37.950
This is the Daedalus. Are there any survivors aboard?

39:38.030 --> 39:39.470
Yes, Sir.

39:39.510 --> 39:40.670
In fact,

39:41.070 --> 39:44.070
we have a pretty big passenger list.

39:54.070 --> 39:58.230
The explosion was every
bit as destructive as I feared. The...

39:58.270 --> 40:00.430
ash cloud has encircled the entire planet.

40:00.470 --> 40:02.830
Will the Taranian people ever be able to go home?

40:02.870 --> 40:04.590
Not for many years, I'm afraid.

40:04.950 --> 40:07.870
We found a planet
that Chancellor Lycus feels is suitable for them.

40:07.910 --> 40:10.190
We've already started relocating the people there.

40:10.590 --> 40:14.550
I'd like you and your team to assist them, just
to make sure the relocation goes smoothly.

40:14.590 --> 40:17.950
I'll take a repair team
back to the Orion, get the engines fixed.

40:17.990 --> 40:20.270
I thought you told Norina you couldn't fix it.

40:20.310 --> 40:23.190
It was never a question
of whether or not I could fix it, it...

40:23.830 --> 40:25.550
<i>Well, as quickly as you can, Rodney.</i>

40:25.710 --> 40:30.430
The Chancellor has graciously allowed us
to use the ship in exchange for our help.

40:30.470 --> 40:32.590
I assume there's still a hive ship on the way?

40:32.630 --> 40:33.750
Yes.

40:33.790 --> 40:35.110
Why only one ship?

40:35.390 --> 40:36.950
We don't know.

40:37.230 --> 40:41.390
Maybe they're just coming to prove
we're still here, but if they manage to do that.

40:41.430 --> 40:44.990
Well, at least we've got the Orion now,
and the city's supply of drones has been replenished.

40:45.030 --> 40:47.310
That's enough to put up a hell of a fight.

40:47.350 --> 40:48.990
Let's not fool ourselves.

40:49.030 --> 40:52.990
If they come in full force, and there is no reason
to believe that they won't this time,

40:53.030 --> 40:56.550
- then I'm sorry, but...
- It's not going to be enough.

41:03.950 --> 41:05.910
It's all we've got.
