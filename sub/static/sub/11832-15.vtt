WEBVTT

00:02.100 --> 00:04.010
WOMAN: Previously
on "The Practice"...

00:04.010 --> 00:05.090
- We'd be looking for you
to handle litigation

00:05.090 --> 00:07.050
in Massachusetts,
state and federal.

00:07.050 --> 00:10.050
Your firm, particularly you,
come highly recommended.

00:10.050 --> 00:11.100
- Well, that's nice to hear.

00:11.100 --> 00:12.170
- My recommendation is that

00:12.170 --> 00:14.120
we don't take this client
at all.

00:14.120 --> 00:15.230
- Excuse me?

00:15.230 --> 00:17.130
- Ellenor,
it's asbestos defense work.

00:17.130 --> 00:19.010
I mean, this company
killed a lot of innocent people.

00:19.010 --> 00:20.080
I'm not crazy about--

00:20.080 --> 00:21.130
- The only difference
between them

00:21.130 --> 00:23.030
and half our other clients

00:23.030 --> 00:24.230
is that this one
didn't intend to kill anybody,

00:24.230 --> 00:26.100
and they're willing
to pay us 20 times

00:26.100 --> 00:27.150
the amount to defend them.

00:27.150 --> 00:28.220
- I decide tiebreakers.

00:28.220 --> 00:30.060
We reject the client.

00:30.060 --> 00:31.150
REBECCA:
You getting two votes, okay,

00:31.150 --> 00:33.060
but you also getting
to be tiebreaker?

00:33.060 --> 00:35.060
- It's in the partnership
agreement, Rebecca.

00:35.060 --> 00:37.050
- Maybe so, but this alliance
with Lindsay is--

00:37.050 --> 00:39.190
- Lindsay's free to vote
her way, and I'll vote my mine.

00:39.190 --> 00:42.130
- This new client is exactly
our ticket to admission

00:42.130 --> 00:44.050
to the other world
that you want,

00:44.050 --> 00:45.190
and by you voting
to turn it down tells me

00:45.190 --> 00:48.090
that you are either more
concerned with your own success

00:48.090 --> 00:50.010
than that of the firm's
or you are suddenly

00:50.010 --> 00:52.030
under the influence
of Bobby's bedcovers.

00:52.030 --> 00:53.230
- I understand
your disappointment

00:53.230 --> 00:56.070
in our not taking your new
client, but to accuse Lindsay--

00:56.070 --> 00:58.000
- Oh, what?
She go running to her boyfriend?

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
- I'm entitled
to some respect from you.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.120
Not just because
I'm senior partner

01:01.120 --> 01:03.090
but because I think
I've earned it.

01:03.090 --> 01:05.050
- I'm sorry.

01:07.030 --> 01:08.140
- This should be
a two-day trial tops.

01:08.140 --> 01:09.230
- Two days?

01:09.230 --> 01:10.230
- We're putting up
two witnesses.

01:10.230 --> 01:12.120
They're calling one.

01:12.120 --> 01:14.150
We'll be going to a jury
by the end of the week.

01:14.150 --> 01:16.180
- Listen, closing arguments.
I think I should do it.

01:16.180 --> 01:18.020
- Why?

01:18.020 --> 01:19.120
- Well,
you're doing the witnesses,

01:19.120 --> 01:20.150
and I'll have more time to--

01:20.150 --> 01:21.160
- That's not what you meant.

01:21.160 --> 01:23.090
- Sorry?

01:23.090 --> 01:25.100
- No, you said you should do it,
like you'd be better.

01:25.100 --> 01:27.130
Not like you'd have
more time to prepare.

01:27.130 --> 01:28.190
- No, I didn't mean it
like that.

01:28.190 --> 01:30.040
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

01:30.040 --> 01:31.210
- Lindsay,
I know your little inflections.

01:31.210 --> 01:33.150
I know when you said
that you meant

01:33.150 --> 01:36.070
you'd be more qualified
to do the closing.

01:36.070 --> 01:38.160
Now, you can either
tell me why you think

01:38.160 --> 01:41.000
you're more qualified or not,

01:41.000 --> 01:42.130
and if you don't,

01:42.130 --> 01:46.080
I have to take that as a lie.

01:46.080 --> 01:50.200
Are you a liar?

01:50.200 --> 01:52.230
- That was really good.

01:52.230 --> 01:55.110
You're just
such a clever lawyer.

01:55.110 --> 01:57.220
So good, it's just hard
to imagine that I can believe

01:57.220 --> 02:02.100
that I'm more qualified
to do the closing,

02:02.100 --> 02:03.170
but I am.

02:11.230 --> 02:15.110
- You know, maybe it's...

02:15.110 --> 02:18.070
not smart
to try cases together.

02:18.070 --> 02:20.160
- Maybe not.

02:24.030 --> 02:27.050

02:27.050 --> 02:30.150

You know I'm in trial.

You move with it.

03:41.140 --> 03:44.130

I get that rub from Bobby.

03:44.130 --> 03:46.130
- Funny.

03:49.150 --> 03:51.140
- They tell me it's
because of our popularity,

03:51.140 --> 03:53.090
because of the cuisine,

03:53.090 --> 03:56.040
because everybody in the city
wants to eat there.

03:56.040 --> 03:58.000
That was the nature
of the piece,

03:58.000 --> 04:00.230
and that's why I gave them
full access to do the piece.

04:00.230 --> 04:02.200
- And what happened?

04:02.200 --> 04:04.070
- Instead of doing
a positive feature

04:04.070 --> 04:05.130
as they promised,

04:05.130 --> 04:08.130
they ambushed me
with this big story

04:08.130 --> 04:09.190
on bugs.

04:09.190 --> 04:11.080
BOBBY: Bugs?

04:11.080 --> 04:13.100
JACOBS: Bugs in the kitchen,
bugs on the floor.

04:13.100 --> 04:15.150
They condemned
my restaurant as unsanitary.

04:15.150 --> 04:17.190
It's the lead story on the news.

04:17.190 --> 04:19.170
My restaurant is closed.

04:19.170 --> 04:23.080
My reputation is destroyed
by those liars.

04:23.080 --> 04:25.000
- Objection.
- Sustained.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.180
- Mr. Jacobs,
had they not represented to you

04:27.180 --> 04:30.160
that this would be
a positive news story,

04:30.160 --> 04:32.060
would you have granted
the interview

04:32.060 --> 04:33.210
and let the cameras in?

04:33.210 --> 04:35.060
- Of course not.

04:35.060 --> 04:39.000
Their ticket
to admission was a lie.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
- Thank you.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
- Do you deny
that they discovered bugs?

04:44.000 --> 04:45.060
- Any restaurant has bugs.

04:45.060 --> 04:47.010
You got food, you get bugs.

04:47.010 --> 04:48.200
It's not like we serve them.

04:48.200 --> 04:51.110
WEILAND: And if I'm a patron
sitting in your restaurant

04:51.110 --> 04:53.130
and I ask if you have bugs,

04:53.130 --> 04:55.100
is that the answer you'd give?

04:55.100 --> 04:57.110
- I haven't been asked
that question in 20 years,

04:57.110 --> 04:58.220
and if you were
in my restaurant, sir,

04:58.220 --> 05:00.090
you wouldn't ask it.

05:00.090 --> 05:04.200
You'd only be thinking
of how good the food is.

05:04.200 --> 05:06.190
- You could be more humble,
for God's sakes.

05:06.190 --> 05:08.230
- It would be false.
Humility isn't something I do.

05:08.230 --> 05:10.120
- Once in 20 years,
you could try it.

05:10.120 --> 05:12.090
JACOBS: Oh, don't talk
to me like that, Pamela.

05:12.090 --> 05:13.230
- This is our life's work.
- Look, she's right, Dad.

05:13.230 --> 05:15.120
If the jury doesn't find you
sympathetic--

05:15.120 --> 05:17.030
- Don't you talk to me either.
This is my--

05:20.140 --> 05:22.010
Listen to your wife, Mr. Jacobs.

05:22.010 --> 05:24.160
We need those jurors
to feel sorry for you.

05:24.160 --> 05:26.080
- No, no.
I don't want pity for me.

05:26.080 --> 05:28.210
I want anger against
that news station.

05:28.210 --> 05:30.140
- They're not gonna
punish the news station

05:30.140 --> 05:32.050
if you behave like an ass.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.070
- He doesn't mean to...

05:42.050 --> 05:46.180
This restaurant means
everything to our family.

05:52.040 --> 05:54.000
- I know.

05:55.150 --> 05:56.170
I know.

06:02.160 --> 06:04.000
- I got a B&amp;E.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.180
It's gonna go fast.
You want it?

06:05.180 --> 06:06.230
- You mean can you
dump it on me?

06:06.230 --> 06:08.130
- Rebecca, it is a trial.

06:08.130 --> 06:10.120
There are six-year associates
across the street

06:10.120 --> 06:12.040
still waiting
for their first jury trial.

06:12.040 --> 06:13.160
Do you have any idea--

06:13.160 --> 06:15.010
- I can hear the sweet song
of the Lujack.

06:15.010 --> 06:16.180
- It'll be good experience.

06:16.180 --> 06:18.120
- I have to finish
this payroll crap,

06:18.120 --> 06:20.080
which I was supposed to finish
by the first of the year,

06:20.080 --> 06:22.120
which I would have finished
but for a few Lujacks

06:22.120 --> 06:24.180
dumped on me
with the best of intentions.

06:24.180 --> 06:27.000
- Doesn't Lucy take care
of all this stuff now?

06:27.000 --> 06:29.140
- Do we really want Lucy
to know how much we all make?

06:29.140 --> 06:31.180
LUCY: I heard that.

06:31.180 --> 06:35.010
- Well, how much money
do we all make?

06:35.010 --> 06:36.110
I'm a partner.

06:36.110 --> 06:38.060
I get access to the books now,
remember?

06:38.060 --> 06:40.060
- I have to run that by Bobby.

06:40.060 --> 06:42.010
- Rebecca, I'm a partner.

06:42.010 --> 06:46.130
Of course I can see what people
are making in my partnership.

06:46.130 --> 06:47.230
REBECCA: Okay.

06:47.230 --> 06:50.040
That's salary
plus partnership draw.

06:50.040 --> 06:51.230
Doesn't include benefits
or insurance.

06:51.230 --> 06:53.190
- Is that right?

06:53.190 --> 06:55.090
- Yeah, why?

06:55.090 --> 06:57.150
- Lindsay makes twice my salary?

06:57.150 --> 06:59.120
- Well, Ellenor,
she brings in a lot of business.

06:59.120 --> 07:01.130
Her percentage--
- Twice?

07:01.130 --> 07:03.090
- Ellenor, she makes almost
as much as Bobby.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.220
You should know that--

07:04.220 --> 07:06.050
- Where's Bobby?
- He's in trial.

07:06.050 --> 07:07.150
- With Lindsay.
- Ah.

07:07.150 --> 07:09.090
EUGENE: What's the matter?

07:09.090 --> 07:10.130
- Nothing.

07:10.130 --> 07:12.060
- I don't believe you.

07:17.190 --> 07:19.160
- It'll have
to wait till tomorrow.

07:19.160 --> 07:21.200
I'm off to enter a plea,
then I'm having a spa day.

07:21.200 --> 07:24.010
Yeah, lucky me.
My first day off in a year.

07:24.010 --> 07:26.120
All right, bye.

07:26.120 --> 07:28.190
Hello.

07:28.190 --> 07:31.050
- Miss Gamble?

07:31.050 --> 07:33.050
I'm Sylvie Tyler.

07:33.050 --> 07:35.190
It was my cat who was killed.

07:35.190 --> 07:37.070
- Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

07:37.070 --> 07:38.220
Please.

07:38.220 --> 07:40.160
- I was curious.

07:40.160 --> 07:43.130
You don't plan
to call me a witness?

07:43.130 --> 07:45.020
- Well,
there's not going to be a trial.

07:45.020 --> 07:48.020
The defendant's pleading guilty.

07:48.020 --> 07:49.150
- I see.

07:49.150 --> 07:51.220
So he'll go to jail?

07:51.220 --> 07:54.160
- No, he'll probably
be put on probation.

07:54.160 --> 07:57.160
- What does that mean?

07:57.160 --> 07:59.100
- That...

07:59.100 --> 08:02.070
he'll be on probation,
probably for a year.

08:02.070 --> 08:06.160
- So nothing will happen to him?

08:06.160 --> 08:10.130
I don't mean to sound
like a doddering old loon,

08:10.130 --> 08:13.170
Miss Gamble,

08:13.170 --> 08:17.030
but I was widowed 13 years ago.

08:17.030 --> 08:19.190
For the past 11 years,

08:19.190 --> 08:23.090
Candy--

08:23.090 --> 08:24.090
that was her name,

08:24.090 --> 08:26.040
Candy--

08:26.040 --> 08:29.070
she's been my dearest friend.

08:29.070 --> 08:32.059
The boy knew that.

08:32.059 --> 08:35.080
He was a neighbor.

08:35.080 --> 08:37.110
He knew what...

08:45.090 --> 08:48.160
It's not so bad

08:48.160 --> 08:51.170
to murder somebody's cat?

09:05.010 --> 09:09.150
- I have a massage.

09:09.150 --> 09:11.210
- Instead of balsamic vinegar
and paprika,

09:11.210 --> 09:14.110
we found these little guys.

09:14.110 --> 09:15.220
Or I should say these big guys,

09:15.220 --> 09:17.100
and they were everywhere.

09:17.100 --> 09:19.030
Wondering what gives
the clam chowder

09:19.030 --> 09:21.000
that little extra tang?

09:21.000 --> 09:24.190
Well, it just
might be his sister.

09:26.160 --> 09:28.180
- After this aired,
business went down?

09:28.180 --> 09:30.040
- It died.

09:30.040 --> 09:32.160
Our gross went
from 70,000 a week to 23.

09:32.160 --> 09:35.160
After two months,
we had to close our doors.

09:35.160 --> 09:37.120
BOBBY: Had you made
any other changes?

09:37.120 --> 09:39.000
The menu?
The chef?

09:39.000 --> 09:41.140
Anything else
that could possibly account

09:41.140 --> 09:43.070
for your sudden plunge
in popularity?

09:43.070 --> 09:46.100
- There were no changes
in personnel or substance.

09:46.100 --> 09:49.010
It was that broadcast.

09:49.010 --> 09:52.020
It destroyed us.

09:52.020 --> 09:53.080
- You are the manager?

09:53.080 --> 09:54.140
- I am.

09:54.140 --> 09:56.070
- As well as the son
of the chef?

09:56.070 --> 09:57.130
- It's a family business.

09:57.130 --> 09:58.210
- Yes,

09:58.210 --> 10:00.130
and you don't actually deny

10:00.130 --> 10:02.160
the allegations contained
in that broadcast, do you?

10:02.160 --> 10:04.090
- I certainly dispute the charge

10:04.090 --> 10:06.220
that our corn chowder gets
its flavor from a cockroach.

10:06.220 --> 10:08.140
- But the substance
of that broadcast

10:08.140 --> 10:11.020
was that the place
was bug-infested,

10:11.020 --> 10:13.020
and neither you nor your
father take issue with that,

10:13.020 --> 10:14.150
and here you are suing
a news company--

10:14.150 --> 10:16.170
BOTH: Objection.
- Argumentative.

10:16.170 --> 10:17.170
- Sustained.

10:17.170 --> 10:19.060
- Was my client guilty

10:19.060 --> 10:21.060
of any factual inaccuracies,
to your knowledge?

10:21.060 --> 10:23.140
- They were guilty of lying
to us about the nature of--

10:23.140 --> 10:26.060
- In the broadcast
that we just saw on the monitor,

10:26.060 --> 10:29.170
were there any factual
inaccuracies, to your knowledge?

10:29.170 --> 10:31.060
- The statements
were exaggerated.

10:31.060 --> 10:32.120
- Why didn't you sue
for defamation?

10:32.120 --> 10:33.120
BOTH: Objection.

10:33.120 --> 10:34.160
- Your lawyers told you you had

10:34.160 --> 10:36.020
no case for libel or defamation.

10:36.020 --> 10:38.030
BOTH: Objection.
- Sustained.

10:38.030 --> 10:41.020
- You are not here today
disputing the truth

10:41.020 --> 10:43.100
of my client's broadcast,
are you, sir?

10:45.020 --> 10:46.120
- No.

10:46.120 --> 10:49.090
- Thank you.
That's all.

10:49.090 --> 10:52.220
JUDGE: Counsel?

10:52.220 --> 10:55.100
- The plaintiffs rest,
Your Honor.

10:55.100 --> 10:58.100
- The witness may step down.

10:58.100 --> 11:02.010
- Your Honor, at this time,
we move for a directed verdict

11:02.010 --> 11:03.150
in favor of the defendant.

11:03.150 --> 11:05.070
- I'll hear arguments
after lunch.

11:05.070 --> 11:06.130
Adjourned.

11:10.060 --> 11:12.050
- What's going on?
What is this directed verdict?

11:12.050 --> 11:14.090
- They're basically arguing
that we haven't made a case

11:14.090 --> 11:16.110
and they shouldn't even
be forced to put on a defense.

11:16.110 --> 11:17.230
- We haven't made a case?

11:17.230 --> 11:19.060
- We've got some
First Amendment problems.

11:19.060 --> 11:20.160
- Which Lindsay will address.

11:20.160 --> 11:22.060
I don't expect this
to set us back,

11:22.060 --> 11:23.140
but we only have an hour,
so we need to prepare,

11:23.140 --> 11:24.230
and we'll meet you
right back here.

11:24.230 --> 11:26.110
Come on.
- I'll address it? Me?

11:26.110 --> 11:27.170
- Well, you're
the constitutional expert.

11:27.170 --> 11:29.030
- I'm also second chair.

11:29.030 --> 11:30.180
- Just think of it
as a closing, all right?

11:30.180 --> 11:31.180
- Oh. Oh, funny, Bobby.

11:31.180 --> 11:34.100
- Oh, never mind.

11:34.100 --> 11:36.090
- I want time.

11:36.090 --> 11:37.170
- Excuse me?
- I'll give you a year.

11:37.170 --> 11:39.100
Six months suspended,
six served.

11:39.100 --> 11:41.100
- Ha, ha, ha.
- Best offer, Billy.

11:41.100 --> 11:42.110
- Best offer?

11:42.110 --> 11:43.210
Last night, we had a deal.

11:43.210 --> 11:45.110
You were gonna spend
the day in seaweed.

11:45.110 --> 11:49.030
- I changed my mind.
- Helen, it was a cat.

11:49.030 --> 11:50.030
- I met the owner.

11:50.030 --> 11:51.100
When I said probation,

11:51.100 --> 11:53.180
I had trouble
looking her in the eye.

11:53.180 --> 11:55.110
- I'm giving you a guilty.

11:55.110 --> 11:58.000
At trial, you could lose,
and then you'll really--

11:58.000 --> 12:00.150
- Billy.
Six months served or no deal.

12:00.150 --> 12:02.020
- He starts college in the fall.

12:02.020 --> 12:03.030
I'm not about
to agree to six months.

12:03.030 --> 12:04.110
- Then we go to trial.

12:04.110 --> 12:08.230
- It was a cat!

12:08.230 --> 12:10.170
- 242,000?

12:10.170 --> 12:13.000
- Am I overreacting?

12:13.000 --> 12:14.110
I mean,
I know she brings in business,

12:14.110 --> 12:16.140
but to be making twice
what we do?

12:16.140 --> 12:18.010
- Well, the partnership
agreement is pretty clear.

12:18.010 --> 12:19.180
The formula is--

12:19.180 --> 12:21.120
- Yes, the formula favors
who brings in the business,

12:21.120 --> 12:23.100
but when we vote
on new business

12:23.100 --> 12:24.210
and Lindsay getting one vote

12:24.210 --> 12:27.060
and Bobby getting two
plus the tiebreaker,

12:27.060 --> 12:28.200
with only three other
voting partners,

12:28.200 --> 12:30.060
the two of them control--

12:30.060 --> 12:32.150
- Ellenor.
- They sleep together, Eugene.

12:32.150 --> 12:35.200
Who are we kidding?
She makes twice what we make!

12:35.200 --> 12:37.060
- You forget
that we became partners

12:37.060 --> 12:38.160
because of her power play.

12:38.160 --> 12:40.070
It went to our benefit,
and then--

12:40.070 --> 12:42.010
- You're forgetting
that it was a power play.

12:42.010 --> 12:43.100
Look at these numbers.

12:43.100 --> 12:44.190
Numbers are numbers.

12:44.190 --> 12:47.210
They are not subject
to interpretation.

12:58.130 --> 13:00.080
- I am not comfortable
having this conversation.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.130
- Why?

13:01.130 --> 13:02.170
- I did not show you
those salaries

13:02.170 --> 13:04.070
to start up some revolt.

13:04.070 --> 13:05.070
- It's not a revolt.
We have an issue here.

13:05.070 --> 13:06.150
Are we all gonna just ignore it?

13:06.150 --> 13:07.180
- Look, Ellenor,
I don't like making

13:07.180 --> 13:09.140
half of what she earns either,

13:09.140 --> 13:11.050
but the idea that there's
some evil conspiracy going on?

13:11.050 --> 13:13.020
- I'm not saying that. I'm--
- Yes, you are.

13:13.020 --> 13:14.090
That's why we're having
a secret meeting.

13:14.090 --> 13:15.180
- It's not secret, Rebecca.

13:15.180 --> 13:17.020
- Okay, fine.
Then where's Bobby?

13:17.020 --> 13:18.170
Where's Lindsay?
- In trial.

13:18.170 --> 13:20.120
- Well, then
why can't we wait till then?

13:20.120 --> 13:22.220
I mean, if you have a problem
with somebody, go face-to-face.

13:22.220 --> 13:24.110
I don't like the smell
of this meeting,

13:24.110 --> 13:26.050
and I'm no longer in it.

13:29.180 --> 13:32.130
- She's gonna back Bobby
no matter what.

13:32.130 --> 13:35.170
- I'm backing him too,
at least until I speak to him.

13:35.170 --> 13:38.020
As for Lindsay,
you're making her

13:38.020 --> 13:39.200
into something
that she isn't.

13:39.200 --> 13:41.190
- She's good.

13:41.190 --> 13:43.230
Am I making her into that?

13:52.220 --> 13:54.170
- Nothing
in the broadcast was untrue.

13:54.170 --> 13:57.010
- This isn't a libel case.
It's fraud.

13:57.010 --> 13:59.150
The truth of the broadcast
isn't the issue.

13:59.150 --> 14:00.200
It's the truth of the promise

14:00.200 --> 14:02.120
that got them access
to the rest--

14:02.120 --> 14:04.130
- You cannot decide
whether that promise was broken

14:04.130 --> 14:06.180
without first evaluating
the content of the broadcast.

14:06.180 --> 14:09.010
This is a complete end around
the First Amendment.

14:09.010 --> 14:11.060
- This has nothing to do
with the First Amendment.

14:11.060 --> 14:13.050
- Have you read
the Bill of Rights lately?

14:13.050 --> 14:14.220
- Yes, and I've also
read the Food Lion case,

14:14.220 --> 14:17.060
and ABC made the same
"freedom of the press,

14:17.060 --> 14:19.030
flag-waving" defense.

14:19.030 --> 14:21.020
It didn't work there,
and it's not gonna work here

14:21.020 --> 14:23.100
because the issue here is fraud.

14:23.100 --> 14:25.170
Did the defendant commit fraud
against the plaintiff?

14:25.170 --> 14:27.030
Did the plaintiff
sustain injuries

14:27.030 --> 14:28.120
as a result of the fraud?

14:28.120 --> 14:30.130
The answers
to both questions is yes.

14:30.130 --> 14:32.070
JUDGE: Come on, Counsel.

14:32.070 --> 14:34.120
Whichever way you phrase it,
you are suing a news station

14:34.120 --> 14:35.220
over the content of a broadcast.

14:35.220 --> 14:37.090
- The conduct
for the basis of the suit

14:37.090 --> 14:38.230
is the misrepresentation--
JUDGE: Yes, yes.

14:38.230 --> 14:40.170
You continue to frame
the issue very nicely,

14:40.170 --> 14:42.120
but the net result is the same.

14:42.120 --> 14:45.190
A news station is being sued
for undercover reporting.

14:45.190 --> 14:47.170
- They can do undercover work,

14:47.170 --> 14:49.140
but they just can't commit fraud
against somebody when they're--

14:49.140 --> 14:50.150
JUDGE: And suppose they snuck
in uninvited

14:50.150 --> 14:51.180
and filmed the cockroaches.

14:51.180 --> 14:52.230
Then you'd sue for trespass

14:52.230 --> 14:54.100
and claim a harm
from trespassing.

14:54.100 --> 14:56.060
Nothing to do
with the First Amendment, right?

14:56.060 --> 14:58.000
- These are good questions
from an appellate court judge,

14:58.000 --> 14:59.200
but you're a trial court judge.

14:59.200 --> 15:01.090
The only question
you should be asking

15:01.090 --> 15:04.200
is, have we set forth facts
to support our claim,

15:04.200 --> 15:07.220
and under existing law,
under Food Lion, we have.

15:07.220 --> 15:10.010
- First of all,
this is not Food Lion.

15:10.010 --> 15:13.040
Here, we have an assault
on the freedom of the press,

15:13.040 --> 15:14.230
not to mention
the integrity of journalism.

15:14.230 --> 15:17.070
- Gee, I'd hate to attack
the integrity of journalism.

15:17.070 --> 15:19.070
Your client should've
saluted those cockroaches

15:19.070 --> 15:20.080
out of professional courtesy.

15:20.080 --> 15:21.130
- Oh, you're very clever.

15:21.130 --> 15:23.040
JUDGE: All right, all right.

15:23.040 --> 15:25.100
Look, I'm not gonna
pretend I like this case,

15:25.100 --> 15:28.070
but for now,
I'll let it continue.

15:28.070 --> 15:29.210
Let's bring in the jury.

15:29.210 --> 15:32.040
Mr. Weiland,
you may begin your defense.

15:36.110 --> 15:39.050
- Ready for trial?
- Yes, Your Honor.

15:39.050 --> 15:40.150
- This is the dead animal case?
- Yes.

15:40.150 --> 15:42.090
- I thought
there was gonna be a plea.

15:42.090 --> 15:43.170
- We couldn't come
to an agreement

15:43.170 --> 15:44.180
on sentencing, Your Honor.

15:44.180 --> 15:46.000
- She wants time.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.050
- What do you mean,
she wants time?

15:48.050 --> 15:51.170
- She wants time.
- Time served?

15:51.170 --> 15:55.010
- Yes, for extreme abuse
towards a domestic animal.

15:55.010 --> 15:57.160
Yes, Your Honor,
I believe time is warranted.

15:57.160 --> 15:59.190
- Serious?
- Serious.

15:59.190 --> 16:02.130
- Huh. All right.

16:02.130 --> 16:03.130
Let's impanel--

16:03.130 --> 16:04.150
- Your Honor, the defense

16:04.150 --> 16:05.230
is still willing
to plead guilty,

16:05.230 --> 16:07.160
so we can go right
to sentencing now.

16:07.160 --> 16:11.060
- Excellent.
- Wait a second.

16:11.060 --> 16:14.010
I'd like a trial.
- What?

16:14.010 --> 16:16.010
- I'd like to go forward
with the trial.

16:16.010 --> 16:17.200
JUDGE: Forgive me, Counsel,

16:17.200 --> 16:20.020
I skipped my ginkgo
this morning.

16:20.020 --> 16:21.210
I've got a defendant
wanting to plead guilty

16:21.210 --> 16:23.150
and a prosecutor
demanding a trial?

16:23.150 --> 16:25.170
What the hell is going on?

16:25.170 --> 16:27.070
- He wants to proceed
to sentencing

16:27.070 --> 16:29.170
because he detects
a predisposition on your part

16:29.170 --> 16:31.000
not to give time.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.050
I sense the same predisposition.

16:33.050 --> 16:35.060
I'm confident after you hear
eyewitness testimony

16:35.060 --> 16:36.190
of what actually happened,

16:36.190 --> 16:38.190
that predisposition will change.

16:38.190 --> 16:40.080
- Oh, you want to enflame me?

16:40.080 --> 16:41.210
- I want you to get
a true picture.

16:41.210 --> 16:43.160
JUDGE: I get the picture.

16:43.160 --> 16:45.000
The defendant killed a cat.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.080
If he's pleading guilty,

16:46.080 --> 16:47.180
we're not going
through the charade

16:47.180 --> 16:50.090
of a trial for color commentary.

16:50.090 --> 16:52.050
A guilty finding is entered.

16:52.050 --> 16:53.140
- I'd like
to be heard on sentencing

16:53.140 --> 16:57.040
before you rule, Your Honor.

16:57.040 --> 17:00.120
- One hour.
We're back in.

17:00.120 --> 17:03.060
Blast it.

17:03.060 --> 17:05.160
- My intent was to do
a positive piece.

17:05.160 --> 17:07.190
That is not something
that I was just saying.

17:07.190 --> 17:11.130
- But at some point,
you obviously changed the focus.

17:11.130 --> 17:13.030
- That point came
when we discovered

17:13.030 --> 17:15.230
how unsanitary the kitchen was.

17:15.230 --> 17:19.099
This was a revered
North End family restaurant,

17:19.099 --> 17:21.020
the chef was practically
an icon,

17:21.020 --> 17:23.000
and that's the story
we wanted to tell,

17:23.000 --> 17:25.160
but when I saw
how filthy it was back there,

17:25.160 --> 17:27.160
it became a bigger story

17:27.160 --> 17:29.010
and a more important one

17:29.010 --> 17:30.170
for people to hear given
the health issues.

17:30.170 --> 17:32.080
- But to be clear,

17:32.080 --> 17:35.060
after you were given permission
to come in and film,

17:35.060 --> 17:38.140
your intent was
to do the positive story?

17:38.140 --> 17:40.060
- Yes.

17:40.060 --> 17:43.200
BOBBY: You never would've lied
to get access?

17:43.200 --> 17:45.060
- No.

17:45.060 --> 17:46.170
- When you decided
to switch the focus

17:46.170 --> 17:48.220
to attack the restaurant
on sanitary grounds,

17:48.220 --> 17:51.100
did you tell anybody
at the restaurant?

17:51.100 --> 17:52.180
- No.

17:52.180 --> 17:54.140
- You just continued to film.
- Yes.

17:54.140 --> 17:56.080
- Were you being honorable

17:56.080 --> 17:58.090
when you changed the focus
and didn't tell my client

17:58.090 --> 18:00.030
you were now
out to trash his restaurant?

18:00.030 --> 18:01.200
- I'm a news reporter,
Mr. Donnell.

18:01.200 --> 18:04.180
- You're a news reporter.

18:04.180 --> 18:06.090
Does that mean
you were being honorable?

18:06.090 --> 18:08.200
Or is that the justification
for being dishonorable?

18:08.200 --> 18:10.170
WEILAND: Objection.
- Overruled.

18:10.170 --> 18:12.110
- At the time
you changed your focus,

18:12.110 --> 18:14.210
why didn't you tell my client?

18:14.210 --> 18:16.110
- He would've thrown us out.

18:16.110 --> 18:17.210
BOBBY: You didn't want him
to know the truth.

18:17.210 --> 18:20.030
- At that point, no.

18:20.030 --> 18:22.030
- Do you know whether or not
my client's restaurant

18:22.030 --> 18:23.180
received any code violations?

18:23.180 --> 18:25.070
- To my knowledge,
they have not.

18:25.070 --> 18:27.160
- Did you mention that
in your broadcast?

18:27.160 --> 18:29.100
- Just because a restaurant
hasn't been cited doesn't mean--

18:29.100 --> 18:30.160
- The question before you is,

18:30.160 --> 18:32.000
did you report
in your broadcast

18:32.000 --> 18:33.160
that my client's restaurant

18:33.160 --> 18:37.120
has never been cited
for sanitary code violation?

18:37.120 --> 18:39.190
- We did not report that.

18:39.190 --> 18:42.000
- Mr. Sawyer,
what did you think

18:42.000 --> 18:43.140
would happen
to my client's restaurant

18:43.140 --> 18:44.210
after you aired this piece?

18:44.210 --> 18:46.040
- I knew it would be
detrimental.

18:46.040 --> 18:48.080
- You knew it would be
detrimental?

18:48.080 --> 18:51.010
Did you consider that
it might destroy his business?

18:51.010 --> 18:52.010
- Of course.

18:52.010 --> 18:53.180
I had to consider that.

18:53.180 --> 18:55.150
- So you knew
you were being deceptive,

18:55.150 --> 18:57.210
and you knew they'd get hurt
by relying on your deception.

18:57.210 --> 18:59.220
That's pretty much it.
Right, Mr. Sawyer?

18:59.220 --> 19:03.190
- Exposé reporting is a
tough business, Mr. Donnell.

19:03.190 --> 19:05.010
- Yeah.

19:05.010 --> 19:08.130
Tougher on some than others,
I guess.

19:12.150 --> 19:16.030
- Basically, I'll just ask you
to talk about the loss you feel.

19:16.030 --> 19:17.210
You can do it in a narrative,

19:17.210 --> 19:19.220
but I think I can make it
more effective with a Q&amp;A.

19:19.220 --> 19:21.090
- Okay.

19:21.090 --> 19:23.020
- And then with the witness,
Mr. Patterson,

19:23.020 --> 19:25.030
I'll ask him to describe
how he saw the cat killed.

19:25.030 --> 19:26.160
- Okay.

19:26.160 --> 19:29.180
- You might want to leave
the room for that part.

19:29.180 --> 19:33.170
- This judge...

19:33.170 --> 19:36.050
he doesn't seem to care much.

19:36.050 --> 19:40.080
- You have to realize
these judges deal with

19:40.080 --> 19:43.200
rapists and murderers
on a daily basis.

19:46.070 --> 19:50.030
- She was ruining the fabric.

19:50.030 --> 19:51.150
Some of my friends said,

19:51.150 --> 19:53.190
"Get her declawed."

19:53.190 --> 19:55.050
I couldn't do it.

19:55.050 --> 19:57.100
I thought, "What if
she gets chased by a dog

19:57.100 --> 19:59.190
and wants to defend herself?"

20:03.140 --> 20:07.070
I never thought to protect her
against teenagers.

20:12.200 --> 20:14.230
- How you doing, Jimmy?

20:14.230 --> 20:17.220
- Not bad.

20:17.220 --> 20:21.010
How's things with you?

20:21.010 --> 20:22.140
- Good.

20:24.020 --> 20:26.090
- Good.

20:26.090 --> 20:28.020
- Listen.

20:28.020 --> 20:30.080
I think the time is right
to bring you up for partner.

20:30.080 --> 20:31.210
Bobby said to wait a year.

20:31.210 --> 20:33.140
It's been a year,
and with your big win

20:33.140 --> 20:35.030
over Tommy Silva--

20:35.030 --> 20:36.200
You know,
timing's everything, they say.

20:36.200 --> 20:41.180
So I just wanted you to know
I fully support it.

20:41.180 --> 20:44.170
- Thank you, Ellenor.

20:44.170 --> 20:46.070
- Sure.

20:46.070 --> 20:48.150
- I think you did some damage.
- I hope.

20:48.150 --> 20:50.000
- So I'll close, right?
- Why?

20:50.000 --> 20:51.080
- Because I've been
preparing it.

20:51.080 --> 20:53.000
I thought we discussed that.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.140
- You keep dodging my question.

20:54.140 --> 20:56.090
Why do you think that
you're better at closing

20:56.090 --> 20:57.110
than I am?

20:57.110 --> 20:58.200
- Look, can't we just skip that?

20:58.200 --> 21:00.090
- No, I'd really
like to know.

21:00.090 --> 21:01.210
- Okay.

21:01.210 --> 21:04.230
Okay, your strength when
it comes to closings is passion.

21:04.230 --> 21:08.160
You know, my strength is more
like clinical persuasion.

21:08.160 --> 21:10.110
- And?

21:10.110 --> 21:12.010
- And standing up and banging
the righteous sympathy drum

21:12.010 --> 21:13.180
isn't gonna sell the jury.

21:13.180 --> 21:15.070
I mean, I saw all those bugs.
I mean, there's--

21:15.070 --> 21:16.100
- I don't bang
the sympathy drum, Lindsay.

21:16.100 --> 21:18.030
I mean, that's not my style.

21:18.030 --> 21:19.200
- I meant that as a compliment.
It's very persuasive.

21:19.200 --> 21:21.070
- That's a compliment?
Banging the sympathy drum?

21:21.070 --> 21:22.190
- Why are you so sensitive?

21:22.190 --> 21:24.110
- No, because, you know,
you make me sound

21:24.110 --> 21:26.010
like I'm Johnnie Cochran
or something.

21:26.010 --> 21:27.110
- Johnnie Cochran's
a good lawyer.

21:27.110 --> 21:29.050
- If you like pulpit-thumping
closings.

21:29.050 --> 21:30.090
I don't do that.

21:30.090 --> 21:31.190
- All I'm saying
or trying to say

21:31.190 --> 21:33.120
is, neutral legal reasoning
works best here.

21:33.120 --> 21:34.180
- You mean dry?

21:34.180 --> 21:37.180
- Excuse me?
- Nothing.

21:37.180 --> 21:39.140
- You think I'm dry?
- No, I don't.

21:39.140 --> 21:40.220
- My closings are not dry.

21:40.220 --> 21:42.060
- Lindsay,
you're a great lawyer,

21:42.060 --> 21:43.210
but Clarence Darrow you're not.

21:43.210 --> 21:45.000
- Oh, and you are?

21:45.000 --> 21:46.070
- No, the jury is bored

21:46.070 --> 21:47.170
by the time summations
roll around.

21:47.170 --> 21:48.200
If you don't stir things up--

21:48.200 --> 21:50.190
- Bored? It's a one-day trial.

21:50.190 --> 21:53.160
- I'm talking in general.
- I'm talking here.

21:53.160 --> 21:56.010
If you go in there and rant
out of anger or outrage,

21:56.010 --> 21:57.190
we'll lose.

21:57.190 --> 21:59.230
A velvet glove is better here,
damn it, and I am not dry.

21:59.230 --> 22:01.100
- Is this the velvet glove
I'm hearing?

22:01.100 --> 22:03.020
- Oh, shut up.
- Fine, you do the closing.

22:03.020 --> 22:04.230
- Fine.

22:04.230 --> 22:06.210
What are you doing?

22:06.210 --> 22:08.110
- Well, I was about to knock.

22:08.110 --> 22:10.110
I never know what I'm
gonna interrupt.

22:10.110 --> 22:12.110
- What's up, Ellenor?

22:12.110 --> 22:14.190
- There are some
partnership issues.

22:14.190 --> 22:16.230
I'd like to talk,
maybe after this trial

22:16.230 --> 22:19.050
is over or whenever
you come up for air.

22:19.050 --> 22:20.210
- What's that supposed to mean?

22:20.210 --> 22:22.070
- Nothing.

22:26.050 --> 22:28.000
- I think she needs
a big vacation, Bobby.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.130
With three votes,
we can give her one.

22:39.040 --> 22:40.180
- This is a sentencing hearing.

22:40.180 --> 22:42.180
- And you can call witnesses
at a sentencing hearing.

22:42.180 --> 22:44.070
- This is a cheap stunt

22:44.070 --> 22:46.020
to exploit your sympathy,
Your Honor, and I--

22:46.020 --> 22:47.150
- I object
to the insulting accusation

22:47.150 --> 22:49.200
that you would be
manipulated by a witness.

22:49.200 --> 22:52.060
A judge should get
a little more credit than that.

22:52.060 --> 22:53.190
- Thank you for your support,
Counsel.

22:53.190 --> 22:55.110
I'm touched.

22:55.110 --> 22:57.060
- I won't take up much
of the Court's time.

22:57.060 --> 22:59.120
- I'll hear from one person
only, the owner of the pet

22:59.120 --> 23:00.200
or the eyewitness, your pick.

23:00.200 --> 23:02.050
- If I promise
to be brief with both?

23:02.050 --> 23:04.150
- One witness only.

23:11.140 --> 23:13.170
- I call Chris Patterson.

23:18.200 --> 23:20.030
- I was in the middle lane.

23:20.030 --> 23:22.110
I was probably
traveling around 60

23:22.110 --> 23:25.050
when this green
station wagon passed me.

23:25.050 --> 23:27.140
- Did you see who was inside?
- Not then.

23:27.140 --> 23:30.020
When the car pulled
into my lane in front of me,

23:30.020 --> 23:33.130
it looked like three kids,
high school age about.

23:33.130 --> 23:35.200
I never really saw their faces.

23:35.200 --> 23:37.090
- Could you tell us
what happened next?

23:37.090 --> 23:40.060
- The driver
reached out his side window

23:40.060 --> 23:41.110
holding something.

23:41.110 --> 23:43.020
I thought it was
a stuffed animal.

23:43.020 --> 23:44.150
It was orange-colored.

23:44.150 --> 23:47.080
Then I saw its legs moving.

23:47.080 --> 23:49.050
I could tell it was alive.

23:49.050 --> 23:50.220
I thought, "What's going on?"

23:50.220 --> 23:52.230
Then after five or ten seconds,

23:52.230 --> 23:55.080
he let it go,

23:55.080 --> 23:56.170
and it hit my windshield,

23:56.170 --> 23:58.230
and it stuck there
for a few seconds.

23:58.230 --> 24:00.210
- Could you tell
what it was then?

24:00.210 --> 24:05.070
- Yes. It was a cat.

24:05.070 --> 24:06.200
- What happened then, sir?

24:06.200 --> 24:09.100
- Well, I swerved.

24:09.100 --> 24:11.010
My windshield was broken.

24:11.010 --> 24:14.010
I managed to get it into
the breakdown lane and stop.

24:14.010 --> 24:15.150
I got out of my car,

24:15.150 --> 24:19.040
and it was still kind of
plastered to my windshield.

24:19.040 --> 24:22.040
- What was?
- The cat.

24:22.040 --> 24:25.050
- What happened next, sir?
- I called the police.

24:25.050 --> 24:27.020
I gave them
a description of the car

24:27.020 --> 24:29.220
plus the first three numbers
of the license,

24:29.220 --> 24:33.070
and then I...

24:33.070 --> 24:36.070
I removed the remains
from my car.

24:39.160 --> 24:42.020
- Hey, Jimmy.
- Ellenor.

24:42.020 --> 24:45.120
- Did you give any thought
to what I said before?

24:45.120 --> 24:48.190
- Actually, I've done nothing
but think about it.

24:48.190 --> 24:52.050
Mainly my thought is,
to what do I owe

24:52.050 --> 24:54.110
this lightning bolt
of good will?

24:54.110 --> 24:55.110
- Sorry?

24:55.110 --> 24:56.200
- A sixth partner would tip

24:56.200 --> 24:58.090
that little power scale,
wouldn't it?

24:58.090 --> 25:00.090
The Bobby-Lindsay block
would no longer control,

25:00.090 --> 25:02.040
and you being my champion,

25:02.040 --> 25:04.100
I'd have these pulls
of loyalty, wouldn't I?

25:04.100 --> 25:05.180
- It isn't about that.

25:05.180 --> 25:07.010
- Really?

25:07.010 --> 25:10.130
Timing really
is everything, I guess.

25:10.130 --> 25:11.220
- You know what, Jimmy?
Forget it.

25:11.220 --> 25:14.020
And forgive me
for looking out for you.

25:14.020 --> 25:16.050
- I don't want to be partner
here, Ellenor.

25:16.050 --> 25:18.090
Too much politics for me.

25:22.140 --> 25:24.110
- When I got my first apartment,

25:24.110 --> 25:27.210
I had cockroaches all over.

25:27.210 --> 25:28.210
Gross.

25:28.210 --> 25:31.210
I hate cockroaches.

25:31.210 --> 25:33.060
Don't we all?

25:33.060 --> 25:35.080
I mean, who here
would go into a restaurant

25:35.080 --> 25:36.190
if they were told

25:36.190 --> 25:39.060
the kitchen was infested
with those gross bugs?

25:39.060 --> 25:40.230
It was a no-brainer.

25:40.230 --> 25:43.040
That broadcast would put
my client's restaurant under.

25:43.040 --> 25:44.040
They knew it.

25:44.040 --> 25:45.190
They aired it anyway,

25:45.190 --> 25:48.010
freedom of the press.

25:48.010 --> 25:49.090
They had a duty,
they might argue.

25:49.090 --> 25:51.030
"Warn the public."

25:51.030 --> 25:53.000
But this case,
it's not about free speech.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.160
It's about fraud.

25:54.160 --> 25:56.150
They made a promise.
They breached that promise.

25:56.150 --> 25:58.010
As a result of that breach,

25:58.010 --> 26:00.120
a family business
has been destroyed.

26:00.120 --> 26:02.190
You want to wrap an American
flag around their conduct?

26:02.190 --> 26:04.100
Stand up and salute
the Constitution?

26:04.100 --> 26:06.030
You can do that.

26:06.030 --> 26:08.150
But freedom of speech
is never a defense to fraud.

26:08.150 --> 26:11.020
Never.

26:11.020 --> 26:13.120
And let's ask ourselves
that dirty little question

26:13.120 --> 26:17.070
we've all secretly been asking.

26:17.070 --> 26:19.120
Do we really, really believe

26:19.120 --> 26:21.150
they went in there
to do a puff piece?

26:21.150 --> 26:23.160
We don't have any evidence
to the contrary.

26:23.160 --> 26:25.160
The truth lies
in their minds only,

26:25.160 --> 26:29.000
but when you look
at the landscape of news today,

26:29.000 --> 26:31.120
you see a lot of fluff features
on restaurants?

26:31.120 --> 26:34.100
Today it's about scandals
and hidden cameras

26:34.100 --> 26:36.060
and catching people.

26:36.060 --> 26:39.040
Every kitchen has bugs.

26:39.040 --> 26:40.160
It's not a big deal, really,

26:40.160 --> 26:43.130
but add some good copy,
some dramatic reporting,

26:43.130 --> 26:45.090
vivid footage,
throw in a health scare,

26:45.090 --> 26:46.210
tease it during prime time.

26:46.210 --> 26:51.010
"Could you be eating
a cockroach tonight?"

26:51.010 --> 26:53.210
That's a great hook.

26:53.210 --> 26:55.140
Easy to manufacture
a story like that

26:55.140 --> 26:57.070
if you've got the footage,
and if you don't?

26:57.070 --> 26:59.010
Well, lie to get it.
Lie proudly.

26:59.010 --> 27:02.020
Declare journalistic integrity.

27:02.020 --> 27:04.050
Look what's happening today.

27:04.050 --> 27:05.200
Forget the tabloids.

27:05.200 --> 27:08.040
We have reporters
at major newspapers

27:08.040 --> 27:10.100
including "The Boston Globe"
right here

27:10.100 --> 27:13.020
getting caught
making up stories.

27:13.020 --> 27:15.200
Writing stories about people
who don't really exist,

27:15.200 --> 27:17.080
plagiarizing.

27:17.080 --> 27:19.020
CNN, "TIME" magazine
reporting

27:19.020 --> 27:20.190
about Tailwind
and germ warfare.

27:20.190 --> 27:22.090
Don't let the facts
spoil a good story.

27:22.090 --> 27:24.070
You can just print
the retraction on weekends

27:24.070 --> 27:25.200
or put it in a footnote.

27:25.200 --> 27:28.180
Anything to get the story
and to get it first.

27:28.180 --> 27:31.040
Who cares who gets hurt?

27:31.040 --> 27:33.210
These people got hurt.

27:33.210 --> 27:36.080
They were defrauded.

27:36.080 --> 27:40.150
It cost them everything they had
worked their whole lives for.

27:40.150 --> 27:44.100
Hail, hail freedom of the press.

27:44.100 --> 27:48.010
I think it's time
to send a little message

27:48.010 --> 27:50.150
to all the cockroaches.

27:55.100 --> 27:58.130
- It's just open season
on the press these days,

27:58.130 --> 27:59.160
isn't it?

27:59.160 --> 28:01.050
And why shouldn't it be?

28:01.050 --> 28:03.180
I mean, look at what
the press has done lately.

28:03.180 --> 28:05.040
We all know it was the media

28:05.040 --> 28:08.070
that planted that intern
in the Oval Office.

28:08.070 --> 28:09.170
We know that it was the press

28:09.170 --> 28:12.040
that caused all
those Republican congressmen

28:12.040 --> 28:15.040
to have that sudden explosion
of conscience,

28:15.040 --> 28:18.200
and it was the journalists
who convinced Kenneth Starr

28:18.200 --> 28:21.040
that his true calling
was pornography.

28:21.040 --> 28:23.010
- I'm sorry,

28:23.010 --> 28:24.130
but we've wandered a little
off the path, haven't we?

28:24.130 --> 28:27.010
- You went into Tailwind.
- All right.

28:27.010 --> 28:29.000
Mr. Weiland.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
- Journalism
is like every profession.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.020
Some of it's good.
Some of it stinks.

28:35.020 --> 28:36.230
But for it to be good,

28:36.230 --> 28:39.140
it has to be unflinching.

28:39.140 --> 28:43.040
Yes, there was
a representation made here

28:43.040 --> 28:45.220
that the article
would be favorable,

28:45.220 --> 28:48.100
but that was based
on the assumption

28:48.100 --> 28:51.200
that the kitchen
was not bug-infested.

28:51.200 --> 28:54.110
Should we have written
a puff piece anyway?

28:54.110 --> 28:56.110
The place is crawling in germs,

28:56.110 --> 29:00.110
but we promised to be nice,
so...

29:00.110 --> 29:04.050
Is that the kind
of press we all want?

29:04.050 --> 29:06.110
What if we'd found body parts?

29:06.110 --> 29:07.220
Promised to be kind?

29:07.220 --> 29:09.020
Don't air it.

29:09.020 --> 29:10.200
Who are we kidding?

29:10.200 --> 29:13.020
They made a discovery,

29:13.020 --> 29:16.000
and it was news.

29:16.000 --> 29:20.020
They would have you believe
that some deal was made here,

29:20.020 --> 29:23.210
a deal which should be
prioritized over the truth.

29:23.210 --> 29:28.060
Who are we kidding?

29:28.060 --> 29:31.100
When news is uncovered,
reporters report it.

29:31.100 --> 29:34.140
That is the essence
of a free press.

29:34.140 --> 29:37.140
We don't clear it
through publicists.

29:37.140 --> 29:40.000
What if you bit
into a cockroach one night

29:40.000 --> 29:44.140
and then found out
that we sat on that story?

29:46.010 --> 29:48.140
Yes.

29:48.140 --> 29:51.100
Send us a message.

30:01.190 --> 30:03.110
- I was showing off
for some friends

30:03.110 --> 30:05.020
like I was cool,

30:05.020 --> 30:07.030
and I did a terrible thing,

30:07.030 --> 30:09.140
and I know that it was cruel.

30:09.140 --> 30:11.060
I know that it was stupid.

30:11.060 --> 30:13.150
I just--

30:13.150 --> 30:17.070
I'm so sorry.

30:17.070 --> 30:20.150
I'm sorry.

30:20.150 --> 30:22.130
- What were you thinking?

30:22.130 --> 30:27.150
- Just that my friends
were all laughing and daring me,

30:27.150 --> 30:32.030
and I guess I just felt that--

30:32.030 --> 30:34.210
like they were all looking
at me like, "Wow."

30:34.210 --> 30:37.140
You know, "You're crazy."

30:37.140 --> 30:40.030
- You know that woman
over there, Mrs. Tyler?

30:40.030 --> 30:41.230
- Yes.

30:41.230 --> 30:43.090
- Is she your neighbor?

30:43.090 --> 30:44.090
- Yes.

30:44.090 --> 30:45.210
- You knew that was her cat,

30:45.210 --> 30:47.030
her pet.

30:47.030 --> 30:50.130
- Yes.

30:50.130 --> 30:53.060
- Counsel, statements?

30:53.060 --> 30:56.200
- I'd like to address
the Court briefly, yes.

30:56.200 --> 30:59.000
- Tomorrow morning, 10:00.

31:05.080 --> 31:08.090
- Hey, how'd it go?
- Okay, I think.

31:08.090 --> 31:10.170
Wow, look at you.

31:10.170 --> 31:12.120
- I have a date with a Celtic.

31:12.120 --> 31:14.160
- A Boston Celtic?
- Mm-hmm.

31:14.160 --> 31:17.150
Now they're getting paid again
and looking to date.

31:26.030 --> 31:27.070
- Closing was good.

31:27.070 --> 31:29.150
- Thank you.

31:29.150 --> 31:32.220
- So we're still fighting?

31:32.220 --> 31:34.070
- Bobby,
I wasn't putting you down.

31:34.070 --> 31:35.120
I was talking about styles.

31:35.120 --> 31:36.180
- I know.
- And you called me dry.

31:36.180 --> 31:38.140
You said I give dry closings.

31:38.140 --> 31:40.100
- I didn't say that.
- Yes, you did. Don't deny--

31:40.100 --> 31:43.010
- Lindsay, as arguments go,
this is a silly one.

31:43.010 --> 31:45.030
Maybe my feelings got hurt
a little, then I hurt yours.

31:45.030 --> 31:49.050
Whatever, but this really
isn't worth a grudge.

31:51.220 --> 31:53.090
- Okay.

31:53.090 --> 31:56.090
- Let's go home,
get some sleep.

31:56.090 --> 31:58.090
That summation made me drowsy.

31:58.090 --> 32:00.180
- Funny.

32:00.180 --> 32:05.050
- Hey. How's things?

32:05.050 --> 32:07.220
- Jury's deliberating,
can't really tell.

32:07.220 --> 32:10.010
- When are you gonna deal
with Ellenor?

32:10.010 --> 32:11.200
- I'll get to her.

32:11.200 --> 32:13.150
- Bobby, she is still reeling
from losing the asbestos client.

32:13.150 --> 32:14.150
She learned how much
Lindsay makes.

32:14.150 --> 32:16.080
Okay, that was my fault.

32:16.080 --> 32:18.050
She's now urging Jimmy
to make a play for partner

32:18.050 --> 32:19.220
so you two won't be able
to control the votes.

32:19.220 --> 32:22.020
We have a little cancer
growing here.

32:22.020 --> 32:25.090
I think you need
to get to her now.

32:27.090 --> 32:28.210
- Let's schedule a meeting.

32:28.210 --> 32:30.100
I want everybody.

32:30.100 --> 32:32.160
- Okay.

32:35.220 --> 32:37.200
- I am so sick of this.

32:41.080 --> 32:43.040
- Okay, I guess
we should just open it up.

32:43.040 --> 32:44.090
- I'm not a partner.

32:44.090 --> 32:46.200
I don't think I should be here.

32:46.200 --> 32:48.110
- This is more like
a team meeting, Jimmy.

32:48.110 --> 32:50.020
I want you here.

32:50.020 --> 32:52.020
Ellenor, let's begin with you.

32:52.020 --> 32:53.230
- Bobby? Sorry.

32:53.230 --> 32:56.130
Steven Weiland's here.

32:56.130 --> 32:59.130
- Excuse me a sec.

32:59.130 --> 33:01.050
Lindsay?

33:13.080 --> 33:14.230
- How was your date
with the Celtic?

33:14.230 --> 33:15.230
- Slam dunk.

33:15.230 --> 33:17.070
I'm seeing him again.

33:17.070 --> 33:18.190
- You're dating
a basketball player?

33:18.190 --> 33:20.040
- They're the most law-abiding

33:20.040 --> 33:21.190
of all professional
athletes, Ellenor.

33:21.190 --> 33:22.220
- Yeah, but doesn't your head

33:22.220 --> 33:26.110
come up to his, you know, knee?

33:26.110 --> 33:28.010
- Nice.

33:28.010 --> 33:29.220
You know, if somebody
makes the slightest remark

33:29.220 --> 33:31.180
about your weight
you're quick to jump,

33:31.180 --> 33:35.030
but it's okay to make fun
of the short-statured.

33:35.030 --> 33:38.040
- I was making fun
of the tall-statured.

33:40.200 --> 33:43.020
- Absolutely sealed,
no admission of liability.

33:43.020 --> 33:44.230
Not even a hint of it.

33:44.230 --> 33:48.130
- I think my client's gonna want
a public apology, otherwise--

33:48.130 --> 33:51.100
- Your client
is gonna turn down $400,000?

33:51.100 --> 33:52.180
- They put him out of business.

33:52.180 --> 33:54.130
- Which means
he must need money.

33:54.130 --> 33:57.090
$400,000.

33:57.090 --> 34:00.000
Something tells me
he's gonna take it.

34:00.000 --> 34:03.010
- We'll bring it to him.

34:03.010 --> 34:06.070
- Quickly.
Jury's out.

34:06.070 --> 34:08.199
- Yesterday,
I just wanted to plead this out

34:08.199 --> 34:10.100
and get to a spa

34:10.100 --> 34:12.219
and have some Swedish sex god
rub the cellulite

34:12.219 --> 34:14.110
out of my glutes,

34:14.110 --> 34:17.070
but then I met
Mrs. Tyler over here,

34:17.070 --> 34:20.219
and suddenly I became horrified

34:20.219 --> 34:24.060
at my not being horrified
over this.

34:24.060 --> 34:27.179
That young man grabbed her pet

34:27.179 --> 34:29.070
and hurled it out of a car

34:29.070 --> 34:32.080
going 60 miles an hour
on a highway.

34:32.080 --> 34:35.040
Imagine, and imagine you, me,

34:35.040 --> 34:39.179
and Mr. Marino not even
batting an eye.

34:39.179 --> 34:42.020
It was somebody's pet,

34:42.020 --> 34:46.120
and if he gets to just
throw on a tie, stand contrite,

34:46.120 --> 34:47.150
say he's sorry

34:47.150 --> 34:48.230
and that's the end of it,

34:48.230 --> 34:53.000
well, who are we?

34:53.000 --> 34:55.040
What he did was depraved.

34:55.040 --> 34:57.010
It was sick,

34:57.010 --> 34:59.110
and if we don't
punish him, well,

34:59.110 --> 35:01.120
maybe we get
the society we deserve.

35:01.120 --> 35:06.070
I'm not saying lock him up
forever, Your Honor, but...

35:06.070 --> 35:10.190
for everybody's sake,
even his,

35:10.190 --> 35:13.060
lock him up some.

35:20.060 --> 35:24.230
- I'm not gonna stand here
and defend what Brent Jones did.

35:24.230 --> 35:27.020
It was sick,

35:27.020 --> 35:28.160
and we should be horrified,

35:28.160 --> 35:31.090
but as Ms. Gamble admitted,

35:31.090 --> 35:32.170
she changed her mind

35:32.170 --> 35:35.060
and decided against probation

35:35.060 --> 35:37.150
only because she met
the owner of the pet,

35:37.150 --> 35:40.030
and suddenly this case
has a human face on it,

35:40.030 --> 35:41.220
but let's be honest.

35:41.220 --> 35:46.070
This is not a case
about a crime against a person.

35:46.070 --> 35:47.160
It was an animal.

35:47.160 --> 35:49.140
I don't mean
to sound cold,

35:49.140 --> 35:52.190
and again, let me reiterate
my own personal condemnation

35:52.190 --> 35:55.200
for this young man's
act of cruelty,

35:55.200 --> 35:58.230
but this is about
killing an animal,

35:58.230 --> 36:00.160
and the killing of animals?

36:00.160 --> 36:02.120
We slaughter cows, pigs,

36:02.120 --> 36:04.090
in cruel ways.

36:04.090 --> 36:06.120
Nobody gets arrested.

36:06.120 --> 36:10.190
A cat is an animal.

36:10.190 --> 36:12.200
Yes, a companion animal.

36:12.200 --> 36:14.190
One that's more loved by humans.

36:14.190 --> 36:16.230
If this was a bobcat caught

36:16.230 --> 36:18.150
and tortured in a spring trap,

36:18.150 --> 36:21.120
we wouldn't be here,
but a domestic cat?

36:21.120 --> 36:24.090
We have to recognize
the hypocrisy, don't we?

36:24.090 --> 36:28.040
We're here not because
of some unusual act of cruelty

36:28.040 --> 36:30.210
but because it happened
to a person's pet.

36:30.210 --> 36:32.130
However much we might want
to look at this

36:32.130 --> 36:34.190
as a crime against humanity,

36:34.190 --> 36:37.010
it isn't.

36:38.230 --> 36:41.230
This is a good young man.

36:41.230 --> 36:43.150
No record.

36:43.150 --> 36:45.140
Honor student
from a good home,

36:45.140 --> 36:47.130
and he did something very stupid

36:47.130 --> 36:50.170
for which he is hugely sorry,

36:50.170 --> 36:54.070
but we have to keep things
in perspective.

36:57.130 --> 36:59.090
- $242,000.

36:59.090 --> 37:00.200
That's my problem.

37:00.200 --> 37:02.040
- You know the pay structure.

37:02.040 --> 37:03.200
Percentage of
the business brought in.

37:03.200 --> 37:05.080
- I know that we take
her clients, not mine.

37:05.080 --> 37:06.130
I know that.

37:06.130 --> 37:07.200
- We voted
on that asbestos client.

37:07.200 --> 37:08.220
- Right,
three hands for, two against,

37:08.220 --> 37:10.170
and since yours count double--

37:10.170 --> 37:12.170
- Is that why you went to Jimmy?
To put a hand in your pocket?

37:12.170 --> 37:15.040
- $242,000.

37:15.040 --> 37:16.140
- Since when did you take
such a strong interest

37:16.140 --> 37:17.210
in math, Ellenor?

37:17.210 --> 37:19.190
- Certain equations
fascinate me.

37:19.190 --> 37:21.120
- Try adding two plus two.

37:21.120 --> 37:23.060
You couldn't do that
with your asbestos clients.

37:23.060 --> 37:24.230
- What is that supposed to mean?
- "They're good people.

37:24.230 --> 37:26.090
They didn't know their stuff
was killing people."

37:26.090 --> 37:27.170
That's crap.

37:27.170 --> 37:28.230
They knew at the turn
of the century

37:28.230 --> 37:30.110
that asbestos kills,
but if they pay

37:30.110 --> 37:31.200
their legal bills,
we'll just ignore it

37:31.200 --> 37:33.010
and pretend
that they're saints--

37:33.010 --> 37:34.090
- All right.

37:34.090 --> 37:35.090
- This isn't gonna
solve anything.

37:35.090 --> 37:36.090
- Bobby?
ALL: What?

37:36.090 --> 37:38.060
- Hey!

37:38.060 --> 37:39.210
You know, it's a small head,
and you can all bite it off,

37:39.210 --> 37:42.050
but there's just not
enough to go around.

37:42.050 --> 37:44.020
The Jacobs family's here.

37:44.020 --> 37:46.140
- Let's pick this up in ten.
- I'm not picking this up.

37:46.140 --> 37:48.200
I'm sick of this.
- What's your problem?

37:48.200 --> 37:50.080
- The problem
is this partnership.

37:50.080 --> 37:52.000
We used to be lawyers
just taking the cases

37:52.000 --> 37:53.190
we felt like taking.

37:53.190 --> 37:56.060
Ever since we became partners
splitting up pieces of the pie,

37:56.060 --> 37:57.060
it's all about that.

37:57.060 --> 37:58.180
All about money.

37:58.180 --> 38:00.150
- Nobody's forcing you, Eugene.
You can divest.

38:00.150 --> 38:02.030
- But the rot is already
in the wood.

38:02.030 --> 38:03.090
- So you might as well
take your cut.

38:03.090 --> 38:04.210
- You pissy little bitch.

38:04.210 --> 38:06.170
EUGENE: You know what, Lindsay?
- Oh, come on.

38:06.170 --> 38:08.010
- I've been trying
to defend you,

38:08.010 --> 38:09.080
but it's getting
harder and harder.

38:09.080 --> 38:10.080
- Defend me against what?

38:10.080 --> 38:11.080
Her? Help somebody who needs it.

38:11.080 --> 38:12.120
- Is this what happens to women

38:12.120 --> 38:13.130
when you insert your penis?

38:13.130 --> 38:14.180
I'm just curious because

38:14.180 --> 38:16.050
they become greedy
little witches--

38:16.050 --> 38:17.150
- Hey! Lindsay!

38:17.150 --> 38:18.210
[all yelling]

38:18.210 --> 38:22.030
Lindsay!

38:22.030 --> 38:24.180
Stop!

38:24.180 --> 38:25.180
- Stop that!

38:25.180 --> 38:26.220
- You've gone crazy!

38:26.220 --> 38:29.040
Get off me! You're crazy!

38:31.110 --> 38:32.130
Ahh!

38:32.130 --> 38:33.130
- Hey! No, no, no.

38:33.130 --> 38:36.090
Lindsay, get off her!

38:36.090 --> 38:37.140
- It's fine.

38:37.140 --> 38:39.220
They're just strategizing.

38:46.140 --> 38:47.140
[all yelling]

38:47.140 --> 38:49.000
[phone ringing]

38:49.000 --> 38:51.100
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- Come on.

38:51.100 --> 38:53.010
- Donnell, Young,
Dole &amp; Frutt.

38:53.010 --> 38:54.010
Hey!

38:54.010 --> 38:57.010
Hey! Verdict.

38:57.010 --> 38:59.000
- Come on.
There's an offer on the table.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.230
We can--we can discuss it
on the way.

39:00.230 --> 39:02.010
Let's go!

39:02.010 --> 39:03.080
- It's none of my business,

39:03.080 --> 39:06.020
but you got
a big morale problem here.

39:12.110 --> 39:15.050
- Mr. Marino's point
is well taken.

39:15.050 --> 39:18.210
We drop live lobsters
in hot, boiling water.

39:18.210 --> 39:22.100
We chop off chickens' heads
and then happily enjoy the meal.

39:22.100 --> 39:26.170
To actually put a person
in jail for killing an animal

39:26.170 --> 39:30.190
is...

39:30.190 --> 39:32.230
But I agree with Ms. Gamble.

39:32.230 --> 39:36.090
This was an act against decency,

39:36.090 --> 39:39.170
and to trivialize it would be
a crime against humanity.

39:39.170 --> 39:43.070
There has to be a consequence

39:43.070 --> 39:45.190
for the sake of society,

39:45.190 --> 39:49.230
for the sake of Mrs. Tyler,

39:49.230 --> 39:53.210
and for the sake
of an innocent cat.

39:53.210 --> 39:56.100
I sentence you
to one year in county,

39:56.100 --> 39:58.130
nine months suspended,
the remaining three

39:58.130 --> 40:02.110
to be served starting now.

40:02.110 --> 40:04.100
Bailiff,
take the defendant into custody.

40:04.100 --> 40:06.050
Adjourned.

40:28.170 --> 40:31.030

40:31.030 --> 40:32.080
The offer's still on the table.

40:32.080 --> 40:33.080
- I said no.

40:33.080 --> 40:34.200
- Joseph, it's $400,000.

40:34.200 --> 40:36.060
Take it.

40:36.060 --> 40:38.000
- I want them to say
that they are wrong.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.080
- They won't do that.

40:39.080 --> 40:41.180
- Then we don't settle.

40:52.040 --> 40:54.150
- Members of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?

40:54.150 --> 40:56.010
- We have, Your Honor.

40:56.010 --> 40:58.190
- Your Honor, one second
to confer with Counsel?

40:58.190 --> 40:59.210
One second.

40:59.210 --> 41:02.140
- Hurry up.

41:02.140 --> 41:05.220
- 1.5, still no admission.

41:05.220 --> 41:08.020
- No. I want the admission.

41:09.230 --> 41:13.140
- Unsealed.
- Okay.

41:13.140 --> 41:16.060
- If it's unsealed,
the public sees the amount.

41:16.060 --> 41:18.120
That's the same as an admission.

41:18.120 --> 41:21.110
1.5, Joe.
Take it.

41:21.110 --> 41:25.020
- They're afraid it'll be more.
- Maybe, but that kind of money?

41:25.020 --> 41:27.190
- No.

41:27.190 --> 41:30.090
- Counsel?

41:30.090 --> 41:32.190
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

41:32.190 --> 41:34.150
What say you?

41:34.150 --> 41:39.100
- Jacobs versus
WYPR Broadcasting Company,

41:39.100 --> 41:41.080
on the grounds of fraud,

41:41.080 --> 41:43.090
we find in favor
of the plaintiff

41:43.090 --> 41:45.220
and order the defendant
to pay damages

41:45.220 --> 41:49.060
in the amount of $200,000.

41:54.000 --> 41:57.050
We further order the defendant
to pay punitive damages

41:57.050 --> 42:00.150
in the amount
of $18 million dollars.

42:00.150 --> 42:01.150
- What?

42:01.150 --> 42:02.130
- 18 million?

42:02.130 --> 42:04.020
- What?
- Wow.

42:04.020 --> 42:05.100
- Did she say $18 million?
JUDGE: Order.

42:05.100 --> 42:06.100
- Yes.
- Yes.

42:06.100 --> 42:07.100
JUDGE: Order!

42:07.100 --> 42:08.100
[gavel banging]

42:08.100 --> 42:10.000
Order!

42:12.210 --> 42:15.070
You got to be kidding me.

42:15.070 --> 42:17.230
You jackasses.

42:17.230 --> 42:20.020
- Your Honor,
I'm not sure that's appropriate.

42:20.020 --> 42:22.150
- $18 million?

42:22.150 --> 42:25.080
What the hell is that?
You find for the plaintiff?

42:25.080 --> 42:27.050
Okay. Personally, I disagree.

42:27.050 --> 42:29.000
But I was prepared
to let it stand.

42:29.000 --> 42:30.200
But 18 million?

42:30.200 --> 42:34.090
That sounds to me
like there's bias going on.

42:34.090 --> 42:39.030
You seem like very nice people,
but--

42:39.030 --> 42:42.220
I'll let the verdict stand,
tempted as I am to vacate it,

42:42.220 --> 42:45.020
but I'm cutting the damages
to $2 million.

42:45.020 --> 42:46.210
You, sir,
should accept it and smile.

42:46.210 --> 42:48.230
- Yes.
- Now, I'm gonna go for a walk.

42:48.230 --> 42:51.220
Any luck, I'll be nicked
by a bus, sprain a knee,

42:51.220 --> 42:54.160
file a claim, get rich,
and retire to the Bahamas.

42:54.160 --> 42:56.130
Adjourned.

43:04.180 --> 43:06.000
- 2 is nice.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.220
18 is better, but 2 is nice.

43:07.220 --> 43:10.010
- It sure is.

43:10.010 --> 43:11.100
- We can open up
a new restaurant now.

43:11.100 --> 43:12.170
Mahogany tables,
curtains.

43:12.170 --> 43:14.030
- Bug spray.

43:14.030 --> 43:17.000
- I don't know
how to say thank you.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.100
- Congratulations, Lindsay.

43:18.100 --> 43:20.170
- Thank you.
- A toast.

Wait, wait, wait.

43:22.010 --> 43:23.160
Can we take a picture?

43:23.160 --> 43:25.130
I'd like to take a picture
of us with our lawyers.

43:25.130 --> 43:27.050
Come on. Ms. Washington, please.

43:27.050 --> 43:29.180
- Sure.

43:29.180 --> 43:31.110
- $2 million.
Unbelievable.

43:31.110 --> 43:32.190
- Tell me about it.

43:32.190 --> 43:34.080
- That's almost $700,000

43:34.080 --> 43:36.170
to the firm on contingency,
you realize that?

43:36.170 --> 43:39.040
- Wow.
- And Lindsay's client too.

43:39.040 --> 43:41.180
She could make over
a million this year.
