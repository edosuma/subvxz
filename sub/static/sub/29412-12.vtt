WEBVTT

00:03.307 --> 00:04.341
Those are yours.

00:05.176 --> 00:07.600
We bought them together.

00:07.624 --> 00:10.619
Because you "found the pattern soothing."

00:18.689 --> 00:20.504
I'm gonna miss you, Shaun.

00:21.359 --> 00:22.659
I love Carly.

00:24.996 --> 00:26.340
And that's great.

00:26.364 --> 00:28.566
I am so happy for you.

00:28.590 --> 00:33.680
Now you can hang the toilet paper
incorrectly anytime you want.

00:33.704 --> 00:35.406
And Carly and I can go back

00:35.430 --> 00:37.479
to the way things were before our fight.

00:38.923 --> 00:42.155
Well, sometimes couples need
a little time to recover.

00:42.179 --> 00:43.390
We won't.

00:43.414 --> 00:45.859
Carly asked for you to move out.

00:45.883 --> 00:48.085
You are moving out.

00:51.036 --> 00:53.439
How many kidneys do I need
in my body to attend prom?

00:53.463 --> 00:54.631
Ryan...

00:54.655 --> 00:56.257
Even if the surgery removes my kidney,

00:56.281 --> 00:57.649
it'll be laparoscopic,

00:57.673 --> 01:00.676
so my inpatient time
will be seven days, tops.

01:00.700 --> 01:02.876
And then three more days of rest at home.

01:02.900 --> 01:04.798
I can take my girlfriend to prom, right?

01:05.936 --> 01:07.648
That's not a purely medical decision.

01:07.672 --> 01:09.182
I have to draw some blood.

01:09.206 --> 01:11.151
What are the chances
Dr. Melendez might be able

01:11.175 --> 01:13.220
to remove the tumor
but spare Ryan's kidney?

01:13.244 --> 01:15.055
Well, the MRI will let us know

01:15.079 --> 01:16.690
how much the chemo shrunk the tumor,

01:16.714 --> 01:19.050
but you shouldn't count on it.

01:19.074 --> 01:22.229
One chili burger,
extra mustard, extra pickles.

01:22.253 --> 01:24.031
Hi. Morning, Mr. Cooper.

01:24.055 --> 01:25.866
I'm not sure he can have
that with his surgery...

01:25.890 --> 01:28.071
Oh, he's fine until about 6:30 tonight.

01:28.793 --> 01:30.003
I know you.

01:30.027 --> 01:32.739
Angie... Valens.

01:32.763 --> 01:34.241
I helped put in your chemo port.

01:34.265 --> 01:36.677
I owe you a big thank-you.

01:36.701 --> 01:38.578
We met in chemo.

01:38.602 --> 01:40.714
They should put us in a public
service announcement or something.

01:40.738 --> 01:44.293
Yeah... "I lost a tumor and gained
a boyfriend. Thanks, chemo."

01:48.546 --> 01:49.890
James McDougall?

01:49.914 --> 01:51.191
That's who we're here for, too.

01:51.215 --> 01:53.694
All of you can head over to Bay 4.

01:53.718 --> 01:55.896
Guy saw me six months ago
for a stress fracture.

01:55.920 --> 01:58.298
He's a lunatic ultra-marathoner.

01:58.322 --> 02:01.021
I just hope he didn't go too
hard too soon and break it again.

02:07.298 --> 02:09.776
He didn't break it again.

02:24.115 --> 02:26.513
Your GP was right to start
you on ketoprofen for the swelling,

02:26.537 --> 02:28.373
but clearly, it isn't working.

02:28.397 --> 02:29.823
That's why Drs. Murphy and Reznick

02:29.847 --> 02:31.998
are going to block off some
of your lymphatic channels.

02:32.022 --> 02:33.834
It should reduce production.

02:33.858 --> 02:36.064
The more pressing concern is why.

02:36.088 --> 02:38.558
Have you ever had surgery
on your lymph nodes?

02:39.529 --> 02:41.975
What about cancer or radiation treatment?

02:41.999 --> 02:44.144
No. Physically, I've always been healthy.

02:44.168 --> 02:45.421
Physically?

02:45.445 --> 02:48.735
I was diagnosed with Persistent
Depressive Disorder when I was 16.

02:50.040 --> 02:52.519
That's why you got to get me
back out on the road, Doc.

02:52.543 --> 02:54.688
Are antidepressants
not effective for you?

02:54.712 --> 02:56.289
I mean, they help.

02:56.313 --> 02:59.159
But running really is key.

02:59.183 --> 03:01.795
Saved my marriage and... And my life.

03:01.819 --> 03:04.047
Lymphedema can be caused by an infection.

03:04.071 --> 03:06.387
He doesn't have a fever.

03:06.411 --> 03:08.101
Ketoprofen can suppress fevers.

03:08.125 --> 03:09.292
Let's get some cultures

03:09.316 --> 03:11.352
and start him on broad-spec antibiotics.

03:15.900 --> 03:19.312
As requested, your restock on enemas.

03:19.336 --> 03:20.537
Nice cover.

03:22.072 --> 03:23.216
How've you been feeling?

03:23.240 --> 03:25.285
The methotrexate is working great.

03:25.309 --> 03:27.487
No pain, no redness.

03:27.511 --> 03:29.356
Stiffness, flu-like symptoms?

03:29.380 --> 03:30.792
No. All good.

03:32.316 --> 03:33.960
How long are you planning to hide out

03:33.984 --> 03:37.159
doing RA exams and clipping
diabetics' toenails?

03:37.988 --> 03:40.233
Dizziness, headaches, nausea?

03:40.257 --> 03:43.749
I... Sometimes I'm a little
queasy after I eat.

03:44.161 --> 03:46.752
You had to love neurosurgery.

03:47.665 --> 03:49.302
How about we try to get you a medication

03:49.326 --> 03:51.093
that doesn't irritate your stomach?

03:51.117 --> 03:53.717
No. My hands feel great.
That's all I care about.

03:54.839 --> 03:57.984
You used to open up skulls and
poke around people's brains.

03:58.008 --> 04:00.355
There's no way this fulfills you.

04:00.379 --> 04:02.189
I enjoy it.

04:02.213 --> 04:04.991
Or, rather, I usually enjoy it.

04:06.717 --> 04:08.398
I'll let you get back to it.

04:10.621 --> 04:12.682
Maybe someone out there needs an enema.

04:17.761 --> 04:19.372
Got a measurement on the Wilms tumor?

04:19.396 --> 04:21.507
Mm, not quite there yet.

04:21.531 --> 04:24.344
You mentioned 7 centimeters as our limit

04:24.368 --> 04:25.779
to doing this laparoscopically.

04:25.803 --> 04:27.914
What if we pushed it to 7.2?

04:27.938 --> 04:30.283
Would speed up recovery.

04:30.307 --> 04:31.755
By a few days.

04:33.277 --> 04:34.955
Forget I brought it up.

04:34.979 --> 04:37.457
Ryan wanting to take
his girlfriend to prom

04:37.481 --> 04:40.055
should not factor into our surgical plan.

04:40.918 --> 04:42.095
Is he nuts about her?

04:42.119 --> 04:44.965
Ohh. Crazy, head over heels in love.

04:44.989 --> 04:46.032
They both are.

04:46.056 --> 04:47.200
Idiots.

04:49.326 --> 04:52.939
I wouldn't mind being
an idiot like that again.

04:52.963 --> 04:56.142
Though, I'm not sure
I ever felt that way,

04:56.166 --> 04:57.644
totally happy.

04:57.668 --> 04:59.095
So therapy's going well?

05:00.604 --> 05:02.786
No metastasis in the lungs.

05:04.308 --> 05:05.509
Look at that.

05:11.348 --> 05:12.893
Your tumor is gone.

05:15.130 --> 05:16.497
Gone?

05:17.588 --> 05:19.165
How's that possible?

05:19.189 --> 05:21.735
The chemotherapy worked
better than we expected.

05:21.759 --> 05:24.671
Wait, like, no tumor? Zero?

05:24.695 --> 05:27.140
- No need for surgery whatsoever?
- That is right.

05:27.164 --> 05:29.009
These are discharge forms.

05:32.169 --> 05:34.314
Both of my kidneys
are taking you to prom!

05:34.338 --> 05:35.749
Aah! Hell, yeah, we are!

05:43.180 --> 05:44.514
Angie?

05:46.951 --> 05:48.695
- Angie!
- She's having a seizure!

05:50.244 --> 05:52.599
2 milligrams of lorazepam
and portable oxygen, stat.

05:52.623 --> 05:53.962
Let's get that under her head.

05:57.628 --> 05:59.092
His lungs are filled with fluid.

06:00.730 --> 06:03.366
I need a chest X-ray
and a bedside ultrasound.

06:03.390 --> 06:04.848
And page Dr. Reznick.

06:06.000 --> 06:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:17.824 --> 06:19.080
Imaging has confirmed

06:19.104 --> 06:21.239
a reoccurrence of your brain tumor.

06:22.181 --> 06:23.575
What stage?

06:24.517 --> 06:26.203
Three.

06:27.287 --> 06:30.598
The best approach is
surgery, a wide resection of the tumor,

06:30.622 --> 06:33.543
followed by radiation and chemo
to encourage full remission.

06:34.827 --> 06:36.796
Sounds like a fun couple months.

06:37.297 --> 06:41.092
Full recovery will probably
take closer to eight.

06:46.139 --> 06:48.099
We can get through this, baby,
just like last time.

06:50.476 --> 06:52.855
W-When will the surgery be?

06:52.879 --> 06:54.857
We need to do some additional imaging,

06:54.881 --> 06:56.358
and I'd like to consult a colleague

06:56.382 --> 06:57.826
about the best surgical approach.

06:57.850 --> 06:59.236
That'll take a few days.

07:00.900 --> 07:01.933
Take your time.

07:04.057 --> 07:05.057
Prom?

07:06.326 --> 07:07.536
Yeah.

07:07.560 --> 07:09.062
Now that Ryan can go, I have to go.

07:09.086 --> 07:10.688
Honey.

07:10.712 --> 07:12.580
This is your health we're talking about.

07:12.604 --> 07:15.273
Mom, please.

07:15.297 --> 07:17.599
I just want to do this one
thing like a normal kid.

07:20.673 --> 07:22.259
Can you tell her it's okay?

07:24.010 --> 07:25.208
We can't.

07:25.232 --> 07:26.536
Until we remove your tumor,

07:26.560 --> 07:28.515
you're at risk of
potentially fatal seizures.

07:30.883 --> 07:32.194
After you're recovered,

07:32.218 --> 07:33.920
you and Ryan can get all dressed up,

07:33.944 --> 07:36.356
and we'll go have dinner
at the Grandview. Okay?

07:43.062 --> 07:45.040
Prom sucks.

07:45.064 --> 07:46.709
My buddy had a fake ID.

07:46.733 --> 07:48.510
I got so drunk in the limo
that I passed out

07:48.534 --> 07:50.203
and never made it into the dance.

07:51.237 --> 07:53.290
Maybe that wasn't everybody's experience.

07:53.840 --> 07:55.834
I was prom king. My date was queen.

08:00.246 --> 08:01.787
I had the dress, I had the date,

08:01.811 --> 08:03.773
I had the mom who got arrested.

08:03.797 --> 08:05.928
Spent the night picking
her up from the drunk tank.

08:05.952 --> 08:07.029
Did you see Park while you were there?

08:08.283 --> 08:11.066
Go to scheduling, get Angie's
surgery set for Friday

08:11.090 --> 08:12.934
with the best neurosurgery OR nurses.

08:15.094 --> 08:16.395
Let's go see Glassman.

08:17.563 --> 08:18.798
Now I'm identifying

08:18.822 --> 08:20.590
the submillimeter lymphatic vessels.

08:20.614 --> 08:24.195
I need an 11-0 micro suture
and a 70 micron needle.

08:24.898 --> 08:27.305
Instead of harvesting nodes to this area,

08:27.329 --> 08:30.252
could we redirect lymphatics
away from his lymph system?

08:30.276 --> 08:31.420
We could.

08:31.444 --> 08:33.389
If you identify an appropriate vessel,

08:33.413 --> 08:35.256
you can make the connection.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.668
We're clearly not
dealing with an infection.

08:37.692 --> 08:39.928
There must be a blockage
somewhere in his lymph system.

08:39.952 --> 08:41.864
Most likely cancer.

08:41.888 --> 08:45.100
His CBC didn't show any abnormal cells.

08:45.124 --> 08:47.427
Lymphoma doesn't always show up.

08:47.451 --> 08:49.971
We need to run cytology
on his lymphatic fluid.

08:55.621 --> 08:57.923
It's either gonna be nasty or very nasty,

08:57.947 --> 09:01.917
depending upon how it attaches
to the thalamus and fornix.

09:01.941 --> 09:05.403
Which no imaging or testing
can possibly determine.

09:06.579 --> 09:08.090
So, our options are?

09:08.114 --> 09:11.727
Between an endoscopic approach
or an open anterior one.

09:11.751 --> 09:13.119
That is correct.

09:15.641 --> 09:20.002
I'd run a stereotactic MRI
with fiducials and DTI

09:20.026 --> 09:23.004
to gauge how close the white
matter tracts actually are.

09:24.263 --> 09:25.340
You should scrub in.

09:27.033 --> 09:28.843
Another doctor can cover the clinic.

09:30.136 --> 09:33.039
I haven't been in an OR in over a year,

09:33.063 --> 09:35.098
and then, as a patient.

09:35.122 --> 09:37.186
I'm not asking you to cut.

09:37.210 --> 09:39.511
But it'd be a huge value
to have you there.

09:41.614 --> 09:43.325
I appreciate that.

09:43.349 --> 09:44.693
I'll consider it.

09:59.132 --> 10:02.177
Hello. We need to run cytology
on this lymphatic fluid.

10:02.201 --> 10:04.170
I would be happy to.

10:08.074 --> 10:09.968
Lea moved out this morning.

10:12.879 --> 10:14.823
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

10:14.847 --> 10:16.725
Can you come over tonight?

10:16.749 --> 10:18.527
Uh, that probably won't work...

10:18.551 --> 10:20.145
Or we could go to your apartment?

10:21.554 --> 10:22.856
I can't.

10:24.924 --> 10:27.402
Lea said that it might take time

10:27.426 --> 10:29.371
for us to recover from our fight.

10:29.395 --> 10:31.140
But I told her that we were okay.

10:31.164 --> 10:33.266
We are.

10:33.290 --> 10:35.059
I made plans tonight.

10:35.083 --> 10:38.204
To hang out with a friend
who just got fired.

10:38.604 --> 10:40.957
But I would love to come over
tomorrow night.

10:41.440 --> 10:43.418
Okay.

10:43.442 --> 10:45.379
I'll put a rush on this test, too.

10:53.352 --> 10:56.064
Your lymphovenous
anastomosis technique...

10:56.088 --> 10:58.066
I was impressed.

10:58.090 --> 10:59.535
It's a little early in the morning

10:59.559 --> 11:00.917
to be sucking up, Reznick.

11:00.941 --> 11:03.105
Not for me.
I like to get a jump on things.

11:03.129 --> 11:05.407
I'm fascinated by the way
you use plastic procedures,

11:05.431 --> 11:08.301
like microsurgery,
in other surgical specialties.

11:08.325 --> 11:10.653
I thought it might make an
interesting topic for a paper.

11:11.270 --> 11:12.537
Want to write it with me?

11:14.140 --> 11:15.250
Yes.

11:15.274 --> 11:16.441
Let's talk and eat.

11:19.612 --> 11:20.912
That's not breakfast.

11:22.415 --> 11:24.092
I'm buying.

11:24.116 --> 11:26.228
What publications do you want to target?

11:28.955 --> 11:31.157
Last time, Angie had
bad post-op vomiting.

11:31.181 --> 11:32.447
- Of course. I'll make note of it...
- Excuse me.

11:34.227 --> 11:37.206
She's asleep. She needs her rest.

11:37.230 --> 11:38.807
I'll wait out here until she's awake.

11:38.831 --> 11:40.742
Ryan, your immune system is weak.

11:40.766 --> 11:43.812
It would be so easy for you to
pick up a bug and pass it to Angie.

11:43.836 --> 11:45.747
I haven't been around
anyone but my dad. I swear.

11:45.771 --> 11:47.440
He could wear a mask.

11:51.744 --> 11:54.883
After Angie's surgery,
we'll see about arranging a visit.

11:54.907 --> 11:56.449
Please tell her Ryan came by.

11:59.685 --> 12:01.663
I'm sorry if I overstepped.

12:02.355 --> 12:03.966
I'd like to change Angie's status

12:03.990 --> 12:05.334
to "No visitors" on her chart.

12:05.358 --> 12:06.525
Yeah.

12:14.166 --> 12:15.611
Please take Mr. McDougall to his room.

12:15.635 --> 12:17.053
I'll be there in a moment.

12:19.105 --> 12:20.890
Is that James McDougall?

12:21.707 --> 12:23.518
- And the woman with him?
- His wife.

12:23.542 --> 12:25.454
Is it cancer?

12:25.478 --> 12:27.756
No... Worse.

12:27.780 --> 12:31.193
His lymphedema is caused
by a genetic mutation.

12:31.217 --> 12:33.662
If you don't find a
medication he responds to,

12:33.686 --> 12:36.031
he'll drown from the inside.

12:38.510 --> 12:41.322
The mutation is on James' ARAF gene...

12:41.346 --> 12:43.219
It makes an enzyme called kinase,

12:43.243 --> 12:45.426
which can cause cells to overproliferate.

12:45.450 --> 12:47.292
It's a genetic condition.

12:48.720 --> 12:50.362
What set it off now?

12:50.386 --> 12:51.829
Probably the stress fracture.

12:51.853 --> 12:53.401
Sent his immune system into overdrive,

12:53.425 --> 12:55.008
which fired up his lymphatic system.

12:55.868 --> 12:57.672
What treatment protocol
targets this mutation?

12:57.696 --> 12:59.607
An MEK inhibitor.

12:59.631 --> 13:01.092
The problem is, which one?

13:01.116 --> 13:04.434
There are 41 possibilities,
each with different side effects.

13:05.303 --> 13:06.437
Good luck.

13:06.936 --> 13:08.897
Well, I was hoping you could stay.

13:12.611 --> 13:14.611
Okay. Sure.

13:17.286 --> 13:19.115
We need you to stay completely still.

13:20.458 --> 13:21.701
Not a problem.

13:23.588 --> 13:24.655
You okay?

13:25.957 --> 13:27.802
Ryan totally bailed.

13:27.826 --> 13:29.208
He hasn't come back to see me.

13:32.557 --> 13:34.393
If you tell her that her mom
said he couldn't visit,

13:34.417 --> 13:35.877
she'll be pissed at her mom.

13:35.901 --> 13:37.216
How's that gonna help?

13:39.738 --> 13:42.347
He's probably busy catching up in school.

13:45.577 --> 13:47.488
We had a pact.

13:47.512 --> 13:50.229
As long as we were together,
cancer wasn't gonna beat us.

13:51.450 --> 13:53.227
He broke it.

13:53.251 --> 13:54.595
Cancer wins.

14:00.043 --> 14:01.211
Do you mind finishing?

14:13.472 --> 14:14.515
Imaging finished?

14:14.539 --> 14:15.917
Not quite.

14:15.941 --> 14:19.921
Mrs. Valens, Angie would
really like to see Ryan.

14:19.945 --> 14:21.689
I know you're concerned about infection,

14:21.713 --> 14:23.048
but there is minimal risk.

14:23.072 --> 14:26.057
Actually... Actually, none,
if they do a video chat.

14:26.952 --> 14:28.496
Interesting idea.

14:28.520 --> 14:29.769
I'll think about it.

14:32.524 --> 14:34.326
Angie's depressed.

14:34.350 --> 14:36.871
And studies have shown that
that can have a negative impact

14:36.895 --> 14:38.403
on her surgical outcome.

14:41.500 --> 14:45.046
Ryan doesn't always improve Angie's mood.

14:45.070 --> 14:47.405
A couple of weeks ago,
they had some silly fight,

14:47.429 --> 14:49.851
and she cried for days.

14:49.875 --> 14:51.619
Thank you for letting me know.

14:51.643 --> 14:53.154
I'm gonna do my best to cheer her up.

14:53.178 --> 14:55.156
She's a 16-year-old.

14:55.180 --> 14:56.557
She wants her boyfriend.

14:56.581 --> 14:58.226
Yeah.

14:58.250 --> 15:00.174
And how smart were you when you were 16?

15:07.759 --> 15:09.670
Well, what about Selumetinib?

15:09.694 --> 15:12.406
It's shown promising results
on related conditions.

15:12.430 --> 15:15.042
And a high occurrence of liver disease.

15:15.066 --> 15:18.735
Binimetinib is similar,
but has fewer complications.

15:19.504 --> 15:20.987
Any objections?

15:23.775 --> 15:25.116
Let's start James on that.

15:33.618 --> 15:36.697
This is exciting, working together.

15:36.721 --> 15:38.346
It is.

15:38.370 --> 15:42.925
Although, I'm used to samples
and slides instead of patients.

15:46.765 --> 15:49.544
Patients can be difficult.

15:49.568 --> 15:51.017
But you will be fine.

16:10.255 --> 16:11.422
Do you need something?

16:13.825 --> 16:17.038
I was curious how James was
responding to the Binimetinib.

16:17.062 --> 16:18.272
His urine output is up,

16:18.296 --> 16:20.880
which suggests the lymphatic fluid...

16:21.900 --> 16:23.444
And his potassium is a little low.

16:23.468 --> 16:25.003
Can you... give him this?

16:25.027 --> 16:26.047
I wasn't really...

16:42.921 --> 16:43.998
Hi.

16:44.022 --> 16:45.766
I'm Dr. Lever.

16:45.790 --> 16:47.692
The tumor's abutting
and possibly infiltrating

16:47.716 --> 16:49.451
the white matter tracts of her fornix.

16:49.475 --> 16:51.305
We'll likely have to remove a section.

16:51.329 --> 16:53.741
That'll affect her ability
to form memories.

16:53.765 --> 16:55.109
With a lot of neuropsych rehab,

16:55.133 --> 16:57.871
she may be able to compensate
with other pathways.

16:57.895 --> 17:01.281
Studies have shown that positive
attitudes lead to positive outcomes.

17:01.305 --> 17:02.406
You're worried about her attitude?

17:02.430 --> 17:03.831
She's worried about young love.

17:03.855 --> 17:05.957
I'm worried about what Angie
is facing after surgery.

17:05.981 --> 17:08.349
Physical therapy, cognitive therapy,

17:08.374 --> 17:09.809
one challenge after another.

17:09.833 --> 17:11.472
And what she wants is so simple.

17:13.952 --> 17:15.434
You want to make a sad kid happy?

17:17.194 --> 17:18.362
I guess I do.

17:18.386 --> 17:20.186
Which isn't my job, and I need to stop

17:20.211 --> 17:21.679
getting sucked into
people's personal issues.

17:21.703 --> 17:23.984
Is there a way to do that
without antagonizing the mother?

17:27.898 --> 17:29.310
Maybe.

17:30.426 --> 17:31.701
Then make her happy.

17:48.920 --> 17:51.499
We've never gotten this far before.

17:51.523 --> 17:52.667
No.

17:52.691 --> 17:54.301
We haven't.

17:54.325 --> 17:55.359
And you're okay?

17:56.828 --> 17:58.352
I am very okay.

18:08.206 --> 18:09.250
Carly.

18:09.274 --> 18:10.851
Ohh.

18:24.422 --> 18:25.522
Okay.

18:32.697 --> 18:35.599
Did... I do something wrong?

18:36.868 --> 18:38.809
No, I'm sorry. It's me.

18:40.038 --> 18:43.517
You said we were okay.

18:43.541 --> 18:44.919
I thought we were.

18:44.943 --> 18:46.120
I-I want us to be.

18:46.144 --> 18:48.222
You have no reason to still be mad.

18:48.246 --> 18:49.523
I'm not mad.

18:49.547 --> 18:50.891
I'm... I'm just...

18:57.381 --> 18:58.582
It's Morgan.

18:58.606 --> 19:01.910
The medication caused James
an upper GI bleed.

19:08.230 --> 19:09.875
Have you localized
the source of the bleeding?

19:09.899 --> 19:11.116
Working on it.

19:11.140 --> 19:13.412
Seems to be coming from
the antrum of the stomach.

19:13.436 --> 19:15.272
We stopped the Binimetinib.

19:15.296 --> 19:17.716
On top of causing this, it hadn't
done much to curtail the swelling.

19:17.740 --> 19:19.117
Where's Dr. Lever?

19:19.141 --> 19:21.077
There's the ulcerative lesion. Cautery.

19:24.313 --> 19:26.224
Zebrafish.

19:26.248 --> 19:27.459
They're used in medical research

19:27.483 --> 19:28.984
because of their quick maturation,

19:29.008 --> 19:31.778
and 84% of genes associated
with human disease

19:31.802 --> 19:33.637
have a zebrafish equivalent.

19:33.661 --> 19:37.031
You think we should do
a transgenic expression

19:37.055 --> 19:41.158
of James' ARAF mutation
into the zebrafish genome.

19:41.182 --> 19:42.441
Translation for those of us

19:42.465 --> 19:44.276
without a genetics textbook handy?

19:44.300 --> 19:46.611
We make mini-Jameses, as zebrafish,

19:46.635 --> 19:48.170
all with the same disorder.

19:48.194 --> 19:51.383
Then we test every conceivable
drug on those fish.

19:51.407 --> 19:52.918
How long before we can start testing?

19:52.942 --> 19:54.586
If we implant the embryos now,

19:54.610 --> 19:56.388
probably by late afternoon tomorrow.

19:56.412 --> 19:57.577
Get going.

19:57.601 --> 19:59.658
Shaun, go with her.
You have Path experience.

20:20.836 --> 20:24.015
I understand no means no.

20:24.039 --> 20:27.475
If you don't want to have sex,

20:27.877 --> 20:29.544
I accept that.

20:29.831 --> 20:32.214
But I am very confused.

20:32.548 --> 20:34.493
So am I.

20:34.517 --> 20:36.595
I thought I was fine u-until I...

20:36.619 --> 20:40.665
I told Lea to move out, like you wanted.

20:40.689 --> 20:43.809
You said that things were okay.

20:44.193 --> 20:46.854
They aren't. How do I make them okay?

20:47.696 --> 20:50.107
I can't tell you, because I don't know.

21:14.657 --> 21:16.091
When I was in chemo,

21:16.115 --> 21:18.384
the nurses used to force
that stuff down my throat,

21:18.408 --> 21:21.006
so I know you're not drinking
it because of the taste.

21:22.231 --> 21:23.875
It's fast, easy nutrition.

21:23.899 --> 21:26.852
That and you don't end up puking
your guts out in the bathroom.

21:28.463 --> 21:30.999
I was president of this
hospital for over 10 years.

21:31.023 --> 21:33.693
I made a few friends,
including Jack the janitor...

21:33.717 --> 21:36.821
Talks a lot, A's fan, horrible gossip.

21:36.845 --> 21:39.281
If the methotrexate is making you sick,

21:39.305 --> 21:40.991
we should try another medication.

21:43.785 --> 21:46.388
How can you guarantee
that you're not gonna throw up

21:46.412 --> 21:48.012
in the middle of your next surgery?

21:48.876 --> 21:50.277
It won't happen.

21:51.694 --> 21:54.206
Because it only happens
if I eat solid food.

21:54.230 --> 21:55.714
And I stopped.

21:57.024 --> 21:58.291
At least at work.

22:10.079 --> 22:12.624
That is a lot of fish tanks.

22:12.648 --> 22:17.619
Forty. So we can test all of
the possible medications for...

22:17.876 --> 22:19.444
Are you throwing a party?

22:19.468 --> 22:20.634
Hope so.

22:33.469 --> 22:34.636
How are you doing, Shaun?

22:36.105 --> 22:37.840
Since your father passed away?

22:40.109 --> 22:44.096
I don't think about him very much.

22:48.484 --> 22:51.630
My mom... died recently.

22:51.654 --> 22:53.647
I-I don't know if you knew that.

22:55.291 --> 22:57.735
She pops into my head all the time.

22:59.628 --> 23:01.655
Not always the nicest thoughts.

23:08.270 --> 23:12.124
It's okay not to love them.

23:14.143 --> 23:15.644
They didn't make us who we are.

23:52.848 --> 23:54.382
Has your mom gone home?

23:56.978 --> 24:00.115
There is one more thing
we have to deal with tonight.

24:01.824 --> 24:03.335
Come on.

24:03.359 --> 24:05.803
How many more sets of imaging
can you possibly do?

24:07.663 --> 24:10.542
One of these is your prom dress.

24:10.566 --> 24:14.312
I like the pink, but I think
you'd look gorgeous in both.

24:18.040 --> 24:19.484
Hurry up and choose.

24:19.508 --> 24:21.068
Your date'll be here soon.

24:34.390 --> 24:36.333
All the medications are in.

24:37.076 --> 24:41.072
Which means more waiting
to see which medicine works.

24:41.096 --> 24:42.715
It's hard to be patient.

24:48.303 --> 24:52.016
Do you think the fish control
how they react to the meds?

24:52.474 --> 24:53.541
No.

24:54.877 --> 24:57.229
It's just how their bodies respond.

24:59.895 --> 25:01.900
That's how I felt last night.

25:04.486 --> 25:07.115
I thought I was ready
for us to be together,

25:07.139 --> 25:11.035
but my body had a different response.

25:13.262 --> 25:14.939
I can't turn that response off

25:14.963 --> 25:16.808
any more than these fish can control

25:16.832 --> 25:19.577
how their mutation reacts
to the medication.

25:25.841 --> 25:28.052
Was our mutation

25:28.076 --> 25:30.929
me going to Wyoming with Lea?

It always makes her feel like sh...

28:50.812 --> 28:53.424
It's... prom.

Morgan called. James isn't doing well.

29:37.192 --> 29:40.012
Cross SL-327 off the list.

29:40.862 --> 29:43.374
I see one...

29:43.398 --> 29:46.474
No, two tumors.

30:07.371 --> 30:08.473
Okay.

30:08.945 --> 30:10.657
This is my stop.

30:10.682 --> 30:12.426
I'll see you after.

30:12.451 --> 30:13.928
I love you.

30:13.953 --> 30:15.254
I love you, too, Mom.

30:19.002 --> 30:21.014
Don't worry. Okay?

30:21.238 --> 30:22.438
I got this.

30:24.989 --> 30:26.723
I know you do.

30:34.632 --> 30:35.709
Okay.

30:35.733 --> 30:36.777
Okay.

30:42.185 --> 30:46.370
What if I wake up and
don't remember Ryan at all?

30:49.980 --> 30:51.181
Then...

30:52.516 --> 30:55.253
You'll have the chance to fall
in love with him all over again.

30:59.990 --> 31:01.090
Okay.

31:02.626 --> 31:03.770
Okay.

31:14.725 --> 31:16.912
We're down to five potential options.

31:16.937 --> 31:19.316
I don't need five potential.
I need one actual.

31:19.340 --> 31:21.017
There are two that best curb...

31:21.041 --> 31:22.008
Choose one.

31:23.143 --> 31:27.123
We should try Refametinib.

31:27.147 --> 31:28.959
It caused abnormal cell growth.

31:28.983 --> 31:30.288
Trametinib is safer.

31:31.118 --> 31:32.495
Which doesn't mean it's safe.

31:32.519 --> 31:33.830
Nothing's safe.

31:33.854 --> 31:34.960
Which do you want us to do?

31:39.460 --> 31:40.770
Trametinib.

31:40.794 --> 31:42.439
That's the one.

31:48.235 --> 31:49.736
Saline in.

31:49.760 --> 31:52.382
Advancing scope
toward the third ventricle.

31:52.406 --> 31:54.351
Claire, hold gentle pressure on the tumor

31:54.375 --> 31:56.119
while I cut off its blood supply.

32:02.816 --> 32:04.494
We've got some significant bleeding.

32:04.518 --> 32:06.116
Adjust the scope and suction.

32:11.025 --> 32:12.456
Look higher.

32:13.494 --> 32:14.971
Septal vein... There's your bleeder.

32:14.995 --> 32:16.418
Cauterize away.

33:01.642 --> 33:03.006
Micro dissector.

33:08.115 --> 33:09.956
The tumor's immobile.

33:09.980 --> 33:12.028
I can't resect it without
injuring the nerve tracts.

33:12.052 --> 33:13.797
She'd be comatose.

33:13.821 --> 33:15.185
Try sharp dissection.

33:16.957 --> 33:18.569
- I can't get a plane.
- How bad?

33:18.593 --> 33:20.470
It's completely invaded her thalamus.

33:20.494 --> 33:24.069
Thin it out with a suction aspirator.

33:29.970 --> 33:31.481
It's too adherent.

33:31.505 --> 33:33.245
If I keep going, I'm gonna kill her.

33:35.409 --> 33:36.609
Any ideas?

33:58.759 --> 34:02.274
Tell ICU Angie will be coming
sooner than we planned.

34:03.804 --> 34:05.171
Let's close her up.

34:22.885 --> 34:24.329
What's next?

34:24.353 --> 34:26.630
Another round of radiation, chemo?

34:29.625 --> 34:32.313
Her carcinoma is

34:32.338 --> 34:35.014
unlikely to respond to those therapies.

34:38.667 --> 34:41.021
No. We have to try.

34:42.004 --> 34:43.348
Angie will want to fight.

34:43.371 --> 34:44.683
She's seizing.

34:44.706 --> 34:45.951
Give me lorazepam and Dilantin, stat.

34:45.975 --> 34:47.284
Phenobarb and propofol on deck.

35:10.266 --> 35:11.426
You're crying.

35:14.937 --> 35:16.014
Yes.

35:19.708 --> 35:20.875
Why?

35:23.546 --> 35:26.024
I found James on Facebook.

35:27.683 --> 35:30.236
He and Marjorie want to go to Costa Rica.

35:32.087 --> 35:35.834
Their dog is a three-legged
rescue named Tripod.

35:40.429 --> 35:42.540
He's not a slide. He's a person.

35:43.933 --> 35:45.377
He's a good person.

35:45.401 --> 35:47.179
And he might die.

35:48.871 --> 35:50.924
This is why I like to stay in the lab.

35:56.378 --> 35:57.973
That...

35:58.614 --> 36:01.267
Is a very dumb thing to say.

36:04.046 --> 36:06.564
If you had stayed in the lab,

36:06.822 --> 36:10.026
James would probably be dead already.

36:12.728 --> 36:17.943
Your plan with the
zebrafish gave him a chance.

36:17.967 --> 36:23.748
It was a beautiful, perfect idea,

36:23.772 --> 36:26.451
from a beautiful, almost perfect person.

36:32.581 --> 36:35.393
Your earlobes are lopsided.

37:08.884 --> 37:11.129
I'm so sorry.

37:11.153 --> 37:12.831
We couldn't save her.

37:33.509 --> 37:35.076
Ms. Valens?

38:07.656 --> 38:09.437
Nice call on the zebrafish.

38:29.018 --> 38:31.129
About our paper, let's meet weekly.

38:31.154 --> 38:33.799
I'm thinking lunch every
Tuesday in the cafeteria.

38:33.902 --> 38:35.069
Perfect.

38:45.581 --> 38:48.017
I heard about Melendez's patient.

38:51.453 --> 38:52.487
Yeah.

39:02.498 --> 39:04.242
You were right.

39:04.266 --> 39:08.413
I should probably try
another medication for my RA.

39:10.105 --> 39:11.624
I need solid food.

39:23.619 --> 39:25.180
Claire? Wait up.

39:26.488 --> 39:27.999
You okay?

39:28.023 --> 39:30.101
Fine. I'm just tired.

39:32.101 --> 39:34.346
You did an amazing thing for Angie.

39:34.371 --> 39:37.483
You gave her mother a memory
that she will have forever.

39:37.508 --> 39:39.402
Well, it won't make up
for the daughter she lost.

39:40.102 --> 39:41.146
You're angry.

39:41.170 --> 39:43.648
I'm not. I am sad.

39:43.672 --> 39:45.650
- Who are you angry at?
- I'm not.

39:45.674 --> 39:46.785
Are you angry at me and Glassman

39:46.809 --> 39:47.952
because we couldn't save her?

39:47.976 --> 39:49.687
- No!
- At Angie?

39:49.711 --> 39:51.979
No, you can't be mad
at someone for dying!

39:53.315 --> 39:55.293
That's not true. You know that.

39:57.686 --> 39:59.364
She was sick.

39:59.388 --> 40:01.633
And she was trying to get better.

40:01.657 --> 40:03.986
She failed and left you alone.

40:04.010 --> 40:07.639
After you'd spent a lifetime
trying to take care of her.

40:07.663 --> 40:09.599
You have every reason
to be mad at your mother.

40:11.306 --> 40:13.017
I hate feeling this way.

40:13.042 --> 40:14.920
My whole life, I've been angry at her,

40:14.945 --> 40:16.856
and now it will never change.

40:18.040 --> 40:19.609
I don't know how to stop.

40:23.512 --> 40:25.890
Therapy will help.

40:25.914 --> 40:27.215
Time will help.

40:29.605 --> 40:31.773
There is one other thing
that's worked for me.

40:44.399 --> 40:46.367
Did we fix our mutation?

41:00.015 --> 41:01.659
That the best you got?
