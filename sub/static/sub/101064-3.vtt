11:57.118 --> 11:59.035
right next
to the San Jose Creek.

11:59.118 --> 12:00.577
MICHELLE:
Right.

12:00.661 --> 12:04.243
HOLES: The Horinek-Himmel
attack is October of '79,

12:04.327 --> 12:08.619
and then Offerman-Manning attack
is at the end of December '79.

12:08.702 --> 12:13.744
And they are within a few blocks
of each other.

12:13.827 --> 12:16.786
MICHELLE: On the morning
of December 30th, 1979,

12:16.869 --> 12:19.035
Santa Barbara County
sheriff's deputies

12:19.118 --> 12:20.911
responded to a call
at the condo

12:20.993 --> 12:24.535
of osteopathic surgeon
Dr. Robert Offerman

12:24.619 --> 12:27.952
and his new girlfriend,
psychologist Debra Manning.

12:28.035 --> 12:31.118
Their good friends had arrived
for a tennis game

12:31.202 --> 12:34.202
and found a sliding
glass door open.

12:34.285 --> 12:35.577
HOLES: Our offender goes in.

12:35.661 --> 12:38.827
He gets both Offerman
and Manning bound face-down

12:38.911 --> 12:40.786
in the bed.
And then he leaves,

12:40.869 --> 12:42.911
like he typically would do,
to get the dishes

12:42.993 --> 12:44.577
or whatever else.

12:44.661 --> 12:46.577
MICHELLE: Something he did
with the rapes was--
was like he tied you up,

12:46.661 --> 12:48.952
and then he would go
and eat in your kitchen.

12:49.035 --> 12:52.243
At the Offerman condo,
it was right near Christmas,

12:52.327 --> 12:55.494
and he had taken out
the turkey and eaten it.

12:58.243 --> 13:00.869
HOLES: He goes back in
to check on the victims,

13:00.952 --> 13:03.744
and Dr. Offerman
has slipped his bindings

13:03.827 --> 13:05.494
and gets up and charges him.

13:05.577 --> 13:06.786
(GUNSHOTS)

13:06.869 --> 13:08.744
HOLES: The offender
shoots Offerman,

13:08.827 --> 13:11.118
then goes and shoots Dr. Manning

13:11.202 --> 13:14.410
in the back of her head,
and then runs off.

13:14.494 --> 13:18.077
Because this case went sideways,
he never got a chance

13:18.160 --> 13:20.118
to sexually assault
Debra Manning.

13:20.202 --> 13:22.452
MICHELLE: Do you know
what kind of haunts me is,

13:22.535 --> 13:25.661
do you know what book
was on Offerman's night table?

13:25.744 --> 13:28.993
Offerman was reading something
like,  How to Be Assertive.

13:29.661 --> 13:30.702
HOLES: Oh, really?

13:30.786 --> 13:32.993
MICHELLE: Yeah.
It was just kind of like, oy.

13:40.786 --> 13:44.118
LARRY CROMPTON: I had, uh,
heard of the murders

13:44.202 --> 13:45.702
in Southern California.

13:46.494 --> 13:47.661
So, I call Santa Barbara.

13:47.744 --> 13:49.993
I said, "I think
the Original Night Stalker

13:50.077 --> 13:51.661
is the East Area Rapist."

13:51.744 --> 13:53.661
And they said, "Don't know
what you're talking about.

13:53.744 --> 13:56.452
We don't have anything
like that down here."

13:56.535 --> 13:59.993
And then, uh, in February,
I was sent down to San Diego

14:00.077 --> 14:01.327
to take a class.

14:01.410 --> 14:03.369
And there happened to be
a Santa Barbara deputy

14:03.452 --> 14:05.327
in the class.
And I got talking to him.

14:05.410 --> 14:07.869
And he said, "Yeah, yeah,
we had the, uh,

14:07.952 --> 14:09.285
the double homicide."

14:09.369 --> 14:10.619
"A matter of fact," he said,

14:10.702 --> 14:13.786
"they had an attempted rape
before that."

14:13.869 --> 14:15.118
And I said, "What?"

14:16.285 --> 14:20.410
So, I got those reports,
and the tie-ups.

14:21.410 --> 14:23.577
And, uh, the ski mask.

14:24.410 --> 14:27.410
It all was there.

14:27.494 --> 14:30.494
I know that
it's the same person.

14:30.577 --> 14:32.619
MALE REPORTER: According to
sheriff spokesman Bill Miller,

14:32.702 --> 14:33.952
the department sent
an investigator

14:34.035 --> 14:35.619
to Santa Barbara last week

14:35.702 --> 14:37.535

the December shootings

and his psychologist girlfriend.

MALE INTERVIEWEE:
Two people were murdered.

14:41.744 --> 14:43.993
Uh, but what they have there
is just the evidence

14:44.077 --> 14:46.410

is a strong indication

14:46.494 --> 14:47.869
it could be the same man.

However, when I talked
to Sergeant William Baker

14:49.911 --> 14:51.744

14:51.827 --> 14:53.202

15:10.661 --> 15:13.619
he will continue to hold sway
over us.

to step back.

minute spent hunting him

he already has.

15:47.744 --> 15:50.410
the name "Golden State Killer"
'cause it makes sense.

15:50.494 --> 15:52.661
He terrorized up and down
the state.

15:54.369 --> 16:00.577
It was an effort to recognize
that he was a predator of...

of their dreams.

floated under the radar.

you know, Son of Sam got

ten times more victims

And he was ten times worse.

23:13.619 --> 23:15.202
But then he went
into the house,

23:15.285 --> 23:17.202
and he could hear the alarm
going off.

23:17.285 --> 23:19.619
(ALARM BEEPING)

23:19.702 --> 23:21.202
And Gary thought, "Oh, crap.

23:21.285 --> 23:22.535
They're just getting up
right now,"

23:22.619 --> 23:24.869
which is weird
'cause it was noon or one.

23:24.952 --> 23:26.452
It just kept buzzing.

23:28.118 --> 23:30.369
So, he walked
back to the bedroom.

23:30.452 --> 23:33.202
He saw they were still in bed,
and he still did the, like,

23:33.285 --> 23:34.869
"Ooh,
I need to give them privacy."

23:34.952 --> 23:36.202
But at the same time thought,

23:36.285 --> 23:37.410
"This is weird.
They're not moving,

23:37.494 --> 23:38.786
and the alarm's
still going off."

23:38.869 --> 23:41.744
So, he walked around
to my dad's side of the bed.

23:41.827 --> 23:45.077
(ALARM BEEPING)

23:45.160 --> 23:47.369
He turned off the alarm
and lifted back the cover

23:47.452 --> 23:51.911
and saw that color of what
I imagine was dried blood.

23:51.993 --> 23:55.202
He also knew they weren't moving
and there was big trouble.

23:55.285 --> 23:58.661
He put the cover back
and picked up the phone

23:58.744 --> 24:01.993
that was there by the bed
and called 911.

24:03.410 --> 24:06.243
We started to learn a lot more
about what had happened

24:06.327 --> 24:09.702
in the house and how they died,
how they'd been murdered.

24:09.786 --> 24:12.952
And it was a lot worse
than anybody thought.

24:14.869 --> 24:18.911
HOLES:
The offender is able to get
Lyman face down and bound.

24:18.993 --> 24:21.619
Probably had Charlene
bind Lyman.

24:21.702 --> 24:24.619
He's even using the--
the blanket

24:24.702 --> 24:26.702
tucked up underneath his arms

24:26.786 --> 24:28.619
to make it even that much
more difficult

24:28.702 --> 24:32.577
for Lyman to be able
to escape out of the bed.

24:34.118 --> 24:36.744
Instead of leaving the room
and moving

24:36.827 --> 24:38.702
the woman
out to the family room,

24:38.786 --> 24:40.243
like he typically would do,

24:40.327 --> 24:42.369
I think he is
sexually assaulting Charlene

24:42.452 --> 24:44.369
with Lyman still in that bed.

24:45.452 --> 24:50.327
At some point,
he goes and retrieves a log

24:50.410 --> 24:51.827
and bludgeons them to death.

24:53.827 --> 24:57.077
The homicides up to this point
in time were shooting deaths

24:57.160 --> 25:00.993
because he was reacting
defensively.

25:01.077 --> 25:05.327
This is the first time that
it goes the way he wants,

25:05.410 --> 25:09.327
and he probably realized
a huge psychological release

25:09.410 --> 25:12.243
from accomplishing this task.

Five months

25:24.077 --> 25:27.327

and Patrice Harrington.

the Smith case in Ventura.

MICHELLE: Keith was
a fourth-year medical student.

25:46.744 --> 25:50.452
His wife of four months, Patty,
was a registered nurse.

25:51.786 --> 25:53.869
HOLES:
Keith and Patrice Harrington.

25:53.952 --> 25:56.577
They're found face-down
in their bed.

25:56.661 --> 25:59.869
They'd been bludgeoned to death
with an unknown type weapon.

25:59.952 --> 26:01.869
MICHELLE: A metal fragment
consistent with brass

26:01.952 --> 26:04.452
was found
in Patty's head wound.

26:04.535 --> 26:06.243
That suggested that someone
picked up

26:06.327 --> 26:08.744
one of the newly installed
brass sprinkler heads

26:08.827 --> 26:11.452
from the yard
and slipped inside the house.

26:11.535 --> 26:13.993
In a subdivision
with a manned gate,

26:14.077 --> 26:15.661
it was high-risk.

26:15.744 --> 26:17.535
It suggested
the killer's pleasure

26:17.619 --> 26:20.661

from raising the stakes.

MICHELLE: Manuela was wearing
a brown velour robe

26:47.327 --> 26:49.535
and was partially wrapped
in a sleeping bag

26:49.619 --> 26:52.243
which she sometimes slept in
when she was cold.

26:52.327 --> 26:54.160

was placed

26:54.243 --> 26:56.035
over the top of her head.

26:56.118 --> 26:58.202
And, uh, she was struck
over the head, uh,

26:58.285 --> 26:59.577

26:59.661 --> 27:03.077
causing a hole
in the, uh, bag itself.

27:03.160 --> 27:05.452
MICHELLE: The lamp's absence
gave police a good idea

27:05.535 --> 27:07.786

that was used

27:07.869 --> 27:09.744

DREW WITTHUHN: My brother Dave,
he had a respiratory infection.

27:30.577 --> 27:32.827
So, the recommendation
was that he get checked in

27:32.911 --> 27:34.952

for a couple days.

27:35.035 --> 27:39.744
He had an incredible dose
of survivor's remorse.

27:39.827 --> 27:42.452
He said over and over,
"If I would've been home,

27:42.535 --> 27:44.243
this never would've happened."

27:49.118 --> 27:50.993
Couple days after the funeral,
I went over

27:51.077 --> 27:52.410
and stayed with my brother.

27:52.494 --> 27:53.911
He, you know,
was having a few beers,

27:53.993 --> 27:56.243

He just said, you know,

"Drew,

She wasn't

30:26.661 --> 30:28.952
She was much more interested

it was the same offender,

53:46.952 --> 53:48.285
the same DNA profile.

53:48.369 --> 53:50.535
And of course,
in my jurisdiction

53:50.619 --> 53:52.535
in Contra Costa County,
I had three cases

53:52.619 --> 53:55.035
in which I still had evidence
from the sexual assaults

53:55.118 --> 53:58.535
