WEBVTT

00:56.807 --> 00:58.766
This is the River Seine.

01:00.310 --> 01:01.936
Now I don't know
where it starts,

01:02.020 --> 01:05.815
but it arrives here
and it widens.

01:06.483 --> 01:08.651
It widens around this island.

01:09.194 --> 01:10.987
And on this island,

01:12.406 --> 01:13.656
is Paris.

01:16.493 --> 01:19.579
It has these walls
all around.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.041
They are high and thick.

01:30.257 --> 01:31.966
And towers everywhere.

01:36.597 --> 01:39.015
How do they get
into this city?

01:39.516 --> 01:40.975
There was a bridge.

01:41.059 --> 01:43.019
At least one.
Like this.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.317
What defenses did they have?

01:49.401 --> 01:51.402
I was just a monk.

01:51.486 --> 01:53.613
I did not notice
such things at the time.

01:54.865 --> 01:56.199
Well, what do you say now?

01:58.160 --> 01:59.202
Now?

02:01.413 --> 02:03.706
I would say this city

02:05.083 --> 02:06.250
is impregnable.

02:37.532 --> 02:40.993
There will be something
wrong with it. I know!

02:41.161 --> 02:42.870
Why do you say so?

02:43.455 --> 02:45.081
Look at me.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.124
That has nothing
to do with the baby.

02:51.755 --> 02:53.589
It won't be long now.

02:55.759 --> 02:57.593
Go away, Bjorn!
No.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.136
I don't want this child.

02:59.221 --> 03:02.682
I don't want this child!
I don't want this child!

03:02.766 --> 03:03.849
I do.

03:04.643 --> 03:07.311
It will be weak, deformed.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.731
Maybe you will
love it just the same.

03:10.816 --> 03:12.275
It is coming.

03:13.235 --> 03:14.360
Pray to Freya.

03:32.129 --> 03:33.129
One more.

03:55.152 --> 03:56.652
It is a girl.

03:56.737 --> 03:59.071
Don't show me.
Get rid of it.

04:04.286 --> 04:05.828
Give her to me.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.175
I am a father.

04:20.969 --> 04:22.845
You have
a perfect daughter.

04:23.221 --> 04:25.514
The most beautiful child
I've ever seen.

04:27.809 --> 04:30.353
You're lying. She can't be.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.188
It's impossible.

04:32.272 --> 04:35.066
No, she's not lying.

04:37.361 --> 04:40.863
She needs a name,
your beautiful daughter.

04:41.365 --> 04:44.700
I have a name,
if Porunn agrees.

04:49.081 --> 04:50.873
I would like to
call her Siggy.

04:56.671 --> 04:59.715
Siggy, who saved
the sons of Ragnar.

05:05.472 --> 05:07.556
It is all right,
sweet Siggy.

05:11.520 --> 05:14.939
May the gods watch
and protect you,
my sweet daughter.

05:21.071 --> 05:22.613
Can I hold her?

05:34.459 --> 05:35.459
Thank you.

05:37.087 --> 05:38.754
Thank you for coming back.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.096
Sweet Siggy,

05:48.640 --> 05:51.392
what a family
you've been born into.

06:40.775 --> 06:43.986
You could've had sex
with him in front of
the children for all I care.

06:46.031 --> 06:47.823
Just as long
as you were
watching over them.

07:10.847 --> 07:12.515
Sleep well, my darling.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.609
Ragnar.

07:31.159 --> 07:32.368
Ragnar!

07:36.039 --> 07:39.500
This man is a farmer,
and he has
some news for you.

07:39.584 --> 07:41.710
Lord.
His name is Stender.

07:42.420 --> 07:43.796
His farm is in Wessex.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.173
I know, Floki.
Let the man speak.

07:47.008 --> 07:50.678
King Ecbert's son,
Aethelwulf, came one day

07:51.555 --> 07:52.972
with his nobles
and soldiers,

07:54.057 --> 07:57.977
and killed, burned
and destroyed all
of our settlement.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.979
All of it, Ragnar.

08:03.024 --> 08:04.191
Go on.

08:05.902 --> 08:07.903
The slaughter was great.

08:08.738 --> 08:11.657
All our men, their wives
and their children.

08:12.784 --> 08:13.951
Only a few of us survived.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.205
Somehow we reached
the coast.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.416
We stole a boat.

08:21.084 --> 08:22.876
And then we sailed
through ice and fog.

08:24.546 --> 08:26.880
I just wanted to die,

08:26.965 --> 08:31.051
as my wife, my daughter
and my little boy
had all died,

08:33.179 --> 08:34.972
but the gods refused.

08:36.099 --> 08:38.434
Our misfortune
was never ending.

08:40.604 --> 08:42.605
Storm blew us off course.

08:45.442 --> 08:49.278
At last we reached
a small frozen bay
in GÃ¶tland.

08:51.197 --> 08:53.449
The ship foundered
on the ice.

08:56.953 --> 09:00.956
I saw my eldest son
die before my eyes.

09:06.129 --> 09:09.715
And here I am,
my lord, a broken man,

09:09.799 --> 09:11.925
who only wants to die
and rejoin his family.

09:12.010 --> 09:13.427
Yes, I know.

09:20.018 --> 09:21.935
Do you see now,
Ragnar?

09:23.021 --> 09:25.814
This adventure was
doomed from the start.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.692
We ignored
the warnings of the gods.

09:29.778 --> 09:32.655
And so they refused
to protect our farmers.

09:34.699 --> 09:36.992
And who can
blame them, Ragnar?

09:37.911 --> 09:39.578
Believe me, Floki.

09:41.122 --> 09:42.456
Aethelwulf

09:43.708 --> 09:45.209
and his father

09:47.003 --> 09:49.296
will feel the wrath
of the gods

09:51.299 --> 09:52.716
and my revenge.

09:52.801 --> 09:54.301
And Athelstan?

10:04.604 --> 10:06.397
What about Athelstan?

10:07.565 --> 10:11.276
Athelstan persuaded us
to deal with Ecbert
and the Christians.

10:11.361 --> 10:13.862
He persuaded us
of their good faith.

10:14.531 --> 10:18.659
But now you must
see the truth, Ragnar.
It was all a trap.

10:20.662 --> 10:23.455
Athelstan is not
to blame, Floki.

10:24.666 --> 10:28.043
If anyone is to blame,
it is me.
Do you understand?

10:30.046 --> 10:31.046
Me.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.173
Look at what the gods
are trying to tell us!

10:34.718 --> 10:35.759
Me.

10:55.113 --> 10:57.072
Have you told
anyone else about this?

10:57.532 --> 10:59.324
No one, my lord.
No one.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.788
You are a courageous man,
Stender.

11:04.873 --> 11:05.956
Thank you, my lord.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.541
No, thank you.

11:08.418 --> 11:10.753
You are beloved
by the gods.

11:11.838 --> 11:13.005
Why...

11:13.631 --> 11:14.715
Yes.

11:24.642 --> 11:26.977
Now you can be
with your family.

13:20.550 --> 13:21.633
My lord.

13:24.762 --> 13:27.514
Here is your new son,
my lord Aethelwulf.

13:36.357 --> 13:37.524
A boy?

13:37.984 --> 13:39.568
Congratulations.

13:43.197 --> 13:44.823
My lord.
My lord.

13:44.907 --> 13:46.408
I want my baby.

13:51.748 --> 13:54.124
You must come with us
to the place appointed.

13:54.208 --> 13:55.751
But I am not dressed.
What place appointed?

13:55.835 --> 13:56.918
What are you
talking about?

13:57.003 --> 14:00.172
You have no choice.
It is by the King's order.

14:00.256 --> 14:02.633
No! Take your
hands off me!

14:03.843 --> 14:05.719
You're hurting me! No!

14:07.263 --> 14:09.348
My baby!
My baby! My baby!

14:10.516 --> 14:13.185
My children need me!

14:17.023 --> 14:18.273
No!

14:28.117 --> 14:29.284
Whore!

14:43.758 --> 14:45.384
Aethelwulf!

14:45.468 --> 14:48.637
What is this?
What are you doing to me?

14:50.765 --> 14:53.892
Sire! Sire, please,
have mercy.

14:53.976 --> 14:55.352
Have mercy!

14:56.145 --> 14:59.856
Please, Sire.
Please, I beg mercy.

14:59.941 --> 15:02.609
I beg!

15:02.944 --> 15:06.071
My Lady Judith,
you have been found guilty

15:06.155 --> 15:08.240
of adultery against
your lawful husband.

15:08.866 --> 15:10.867
You refuse to admit
the offense,

15:11.327 --> 15:15.539
but we find sufficient
evidence to exercise
the punishment

15:15.623 --> 15:17.499
advocated by the Holy Book,

15:20.837 --> 15:22.462
that your ears
and nose be cut off

15:25.550 --> 15:27.384
to make real
and visible your crime

15:27.468 --> 15:29.428
against law
and against nature.

15:29.512 --> 15:33.765
Our Lord Jesus
never advocated
such barbarism.

15:33.850 --> 15:35.225
Please, please.

15:35.309 --> 15:37.644
Husband! Father!

15:37.729 --> 15:42.858
Why cannot you show the mercy
our Lord showed to those weak
in the flesh?

15:43.443 --> 15:44.985
Please!

15:45.069 --> 15:46.361
No mercy!

15:46.446 --> 15:48.822
Judith, daughter of Aelle,

15:49.574 --> 15:51.032
wife of Aethelwulf,

15:51.576 --> 15:53.201
you are charged
and found guilty

15:53.286 --> 15:54.828
of the heinous crime
of adultery

15:54.912 --> 15:57.748
with person
or persons unknown.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.501
You must pray to God

16:01.586 --> 16:03.044
for forgiveness.

16:25.610 --> 16:27.068
Stay!

16:31.157 --> 16:34.326
Judith, will you not give us

16:34.410 --> 16:35.952
the name of the father

16:36.037 --> 16:37.037
of your child?

16:42.043 --> 16:43.543
No!

17:12.323 --> 17:13.573
Athelstan.

17:14.033 --> 17:16.660
Hold! Hold!
Athelstan!

17:20.456 --> 17:21.832
What do you mean,
it was Athelstan?

17:21.916 --> 17:24.292
What can you possibly
mean by that?

17:26.671 --> 17:28.296
Athelstan...

17:28.464 --> 17:31.883
Athelstan is the father
of my child.

17:31.968 --> 17:33.134
No!

17:33.678 --> 17:36.096
Athelstan is a holy man.

17:36.180 --> 17:38.306
I cannot blame
my daughter-in-law

17:38.391 --> 17:40.350
for being attracted
to such a man of God.

17:40.434 --> 17:42.435
Father, can you not
imagine my own humiliation?

17:42.520 --> 17:44.187
I can.

17:44.272 --> 17:48.233
But may I suggest
that there are deeper
things involved here?

17:48.317 --> 17:51.361
In my own mind,
there is no doubt

17:51.445 --> 17:53.446
of Athelstan's
deep spirituality,

17:53.531 --> 17:55.740
and his close
connection to God.

17:55.825 --> 17:58.910
So you think
that God had a hand
in this conception?

17:58.995 --> 18:01.997
I do. I do, my son.

18:04.500 --> 18:09.504
So how can we
punish a woman

18:10.256 --> 18:14.175
who, like the blessed Virgin,
has been chosen by God

18:14.719 --> 18:18.263
to give birth to
a very special child?

18:20.725 --> 18:23.560
My baby! My baby!

18:23.936 --> 18:26.313
Please! God!

18:31.027 --> 18:33.653
There will be
a Christening after all.

18:36.282 --> 18:39.367
And the boy's name
will be Alfred.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.085
Oh, Lord.

19:32.046 --> 19:33.171
Lord.

19:34.757 --> 19:36.341
Praise the Lord!

19:39.345 --> 19:41.221
I've asked for a sign.

19:41.764 --> 19:43.765
You have given me a sign.

19:45.476 --> 19:48.103
You've... You've
answered my prayers.

19:51.190 --> 19:54.526
I was blind, but now I see.

19:54.610 --> 19:56.277
I was dead, but...

19:57.697 --> 19:59.072
I'm reborn.

20:02.535 --> 20:03.743
Father,

20:04.745 --> 20:06.287
hear my prayer.

20:07.164 --> 20:10.250
And let my cry
come unto thee.

20:16.882 --> 20:18.550
For the gift of sight,

20:20.261 --> 20:21.845
Lord, thank you.

20:22.596 --> 20:24.639
For the gift of faith.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.057
Thank you.

20:27.101 --> 20:29.394
For by you all
things were created

20:29.478 --> 20:31.688
that are in heaven
and that are in earth.

20:36.986 --> 20:38.820
Visible and invisible.

20:41.115 --> 20:43.074
Whether they be thrones,

20:43.492 --> 20:45.285
powers or dominions,

20:46.829 --> 20:49.164
all things were
created by you.

20:50.458 --> 20:51.833
And for you.

21:46.722 --> 21:47.931
Ragnar!

21:55.231 --> 21:57.315
What are you smiling about?

21:59.985 --> 22:01.945
The Lord has come to me.

22:02.863 --> 22:04.113
The Lord?

22:05.491 --> 22:06.491
Your god?

22:06.867 --> 22:07.909
Yes.

22:10.037 --> 22:11.162
What did he look like?

22:11.247 --> 22:12.997
I felt his presence.

22:13.415 --> 22:14.874
He came
in the form of light.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.209
Did he speak?

22:16.293 --> 22:19.379
No, he did not speak
and yet I heard his voice.

22:19.839 --> 22:21.631
And I am born again.

22:22.716 --> 22:25.844
What do you mean,
born again?
Like... Like a baby?

22:25.928 --> 22:27.679
I've rediscovered
my faith.

22:27.763 --> 22:29.055
I'm a new man.

22:29.139 --> 22:31.349
Born again
through the love
of Jesus Christ.

22:32.101 --> 22:33.685
Then you're
a Christian again?

22:33.769 --> 22:35.353
With all my heart.

22:35.437 --> 22:37.897
With all my soul,
with all my being.

22:38.941 --> 22:41.568
I can no longer
acknowledge your gods.

22:41.652 --> 22:43.695
I suppose it is better
that I leave Kattegat now.

22:43.779 --> 22:47.282
What do you mean?
You cannot leave!
You cannot leave me!

22:50.411 --> 22:51.786
I love you.

22:54.582 --> 22:57.959
And you're the only one
I can trust,
so you must stay.

22:59.837 --> 23:02.797
Well, I'm happy
that you have
found your god.

23:06.260 --> 23:08.761
While you are here
no one will ever hurt you.

23:08.846 --> 23:10.305
I will protect you.

23:12.308 --> 23:14.517
It does not matter
where I go.

23:16.270 --> 23:19.063
What matters to me
is where you're going.

23:23.444 --> 23:24.485
Hmm.

23:52.473 --> 23:53.640
Floki!

23:54.767 --> 23:56.768
Why are you not
working on the boats?

23:56.852 --> 23:58.728
My heart is not in it.

23:59.772 --> 24:00.939
Why not?

24:02.107 --> 24:03.858
Ragnar has no time for me.

24:04.526 --> 24:06.694
And I need to speak
to him about the boats

24:06.779 --> 24:07.946
and other things.

24:08.030 --> 24:09.238
Important things.

24:09.573 --> 24:11.991
But every time,
he's talking to the priest.

24:14.036 --> 24:15.620
Do you know what this is?

24:17.790 --> 24:20.041
This is Athelstan's
sacred arm ring.

24:20.918 --> 24:22.919
The one Ragnar gave him.

24:23.003 --> 24:25.546
I saw him throwing it
into the fjord.

24:28.342 --> 24:29.676
Why would he do that?

24:29.760 --> 24:31.761
Because he hates our gods.

24:32.471 --> 24:33.638
Have you told Ragnar?

24:34.640 --> 24:36.224
What's the point?

24:36.725 --> 24:38.351
He doesn't listen.

24:42.731 --> 24:44.941
I feel worried for my father.

24:46.193 --> 24:47.819
I don't understand
why he is so interested

24:47.903 --> 24:49.946
in the Christians
and Christian things.

24:50.364 --> 24:53.574
I remember when he
told me our family
was descended from Odin.

24:55.077 --> 24:56.869
He made me feel so proud.

25:01.792 --> 25:03.584
What are you
going to do, Floki?

25:04.003 --> 25:06.170
I am going to leave Kattegat.

25:06.255 --> 25:08.715
I will go home
to my own culture.

25:08.799 --> 25:10.591
To Helga and my child.

25:11.385 --> 25:12.802
Don't worry, Bjorn.

25:12.886 --> 25:14.679
I will finish the boats.

25:15.347 --> 25:17.098
And in the meantime,

25:19.435 --> 25:21.477
tell our brothers about this.

25:47.046 --> 25:48.504
Who are they?

25:54.470 --> 25:55.845
That's Kalf.

25:58.474 --> 26:00.808
Those were my ships once.

26:00.893 --> 26:04.312
Now they bring
Kalf to Kattegat.

26:07.649 --> 26:08.649
Kalf!

26:10.027 --> 26:11.402
King Ragnar.

26:11.737 --> 26:13.154
Hello, Kalf.

26:14.114 --> 26:15.448
Greetings.

26:22.122 --> 26:25.124
I join you in the expectation
of the greatest raid

26:25.209 --> 26:27.418
in the history
of our people.

26:32.341 --> 26:33.758
Who is this chunk of meat?

26:33.842 --> 26:35.843
This is Earl Siegfried.

26:35.928 --> 26:40.348
Lord Ragnar. I put
my ships and my warriors
at your disposal.

26:44.019 --> 26:47.396
I'm sure that you remember
King Horik's son,

26:47.481 --> 26:48.940
and the widow of Jarl Borg.

26:49.650 --> 26:53.361
They also have expressed
a desire to take part
in our raid.

26:53.737 --> 26:54.862
Erlendur.

26:55.697 --> 26:56.864
Torvi.

26:59.201 --> 27:02.662
I have to say
that I am a little

27:03.872 --> 27:06.207
caught off guard,
seeing you here.

27:06.834 --> 27:09.460
I figured there was a reason
you spared my life.

27:09.545 --> 27:11.254
Maybe it's for this.

27:11.672 --> 27:12.797
I have to ask,

27:12.881 --> 27:15.216
how is the settlement
in Wessex?

27:16.552 --> 27:17.635
Good.

27:40.242 --> 27:41.909
You cannot ignore him.

27:41.994 --> 27:43.578
I'm not going
to ignore him.

27:43.662 --> 27:46.164
We are going to
fight together,

27:46.248 --> 27:48.833
even though he took away
all that was mine.

27:48.917 --> 27:50.585
All that was ours.

27:52.588 --> 27:53.921
Perhaps it was fated?

27:54.631 --> 27:58.134
And perhaps it is fated
that I shall win
it back some day.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.392
Lagertha.

28:07.895 --> 28:10.980
I see you are making yourself
comfortable here as well.

28:13.859 --> 28:18.029
I have come to join with
King Ragnar and you
in the attack on Paris.

28:18.113 --> 28:19.322
Mmm.

28:19.406 --> 28:21.073
Whatever else divides us,

28:21.617 --> 28:23.910
that simple fact
unites us all.

28:24.995 --> 28:29.498
We will fight
and perhaps, who knows,
we will die together.

28:30.167 --> 28:31.792
And if we don't?

28:33.337 --> 28:35.129
Then we will take care
of the future.

28:35.881 --> 28:38.007
My future or yours?

28:40.427 --> 28:43.387
Forgive me,
but it seems to me

28:43.805 --> 28:46.599
that our destinies
are already
locked together.

28:47.309 --> 28:49.560
And perhaps
always have been.

28:49.645 --> 28:51.270
Wouldn't you agree,
Lagertha?

29:08.247 --> 29:09.747
Don't hide away.

29:09.831 --> 29:11.082
Why not?

29:11.833 --> 29:15.586
Because there is nothing
more beautiful
than a mother.

29:15.921 --> 29:17.505
You're drunk.

29:18.632 --> 29:20.007
I want you.

29:20.092 --> 29:22.176
I know, but I'm sorry.

29:23.011 --> 29:24.512
It's been a long time.

29:26.348 --> 29:28.516
You need to be
with a woman.

29:29.351 --> 29:31.018
Let's find you someone.

29:31.728 --> 29:34.480
Isn't that Torvi,
the widow of Jarl Borg?

29:35.274 --> 29:37.775
Erlendur doesn't
pay her any attention.

29:37.859 --> 29:39.402
You'd like her.

29:41.196 --> 29:42.822
Don't do this.

29:42.906 --> 29:44.573
You don't understand.

29:44.658 --> 29:47.285
I'm doing this
because I want
you to be happy.

29:48.287 --> 29:50.705
My father says
happiness doesn't matter.

29:51.873 --> 29:55.334
But you are not your father,
Bjorn Ironside.

29:55.419 --> 29:57.545
Or have you not
realized that yet?

29:58.964 --> 30:00.506
Good night, husband.

30:04.261 --> 30:05.553
Watch it.

30:45.844 --> 30:46.886
Rollo.

30:50.932 --> 30:53.184
I have nothing
to say to you, priest.

30:53.268 --> 30:54.435
Except this...

30:57.773 --> 30:59.648
Where is your arm ring?

31:01.902 --> 31:03.277
Where is it?

31:14.790 --> 31:18.626
I have someone very special
I want you to meet.

31:29.638 --> 31:31.055
Meet Sinric.

31:31.556 --> 31:33.641
The wanderer
I told you about.

31:34.142 --> 31:36.477
It was he who
guided me to England.

31:51.868 --> 31:53.536
You speak
the language of the Franks.

31:56.498 --> 31:57.998
Not only that.

32:00.001 --> 32:03.170
He also knows how to find
the mouth of the Seine.

32:24.901 --> 32:26.777
Are you thirsty?
Yes.

32:28.405 --> 32:29.655
Thank you.

32:29.739 --> 32:31.157
I remember your husband.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.784
No one could
forget your husband.

32:33.910 --> 32:35.828
He was my father's enemy,

32:35.912 --> 32:37.872
but he was a great man.

32:40.667 --> 32:42.460
And now he is in Valhalla.

32:43.712 --> 32:46.172
Yes, I know.

32:46.548 --> 32:48.340
I know he is with the gods.

32:50.469 --> 32:52.136
And your new husband?

32:52.220 --> 32:53.387
What of him?

32:55.265 --> 32:57.808
He will come to Paris?

32:59.060 --> 33:00.811
And so shall I.

33:00.896 --> 33:02.897
I refuse to be
left behind.

33:04.816 --> 33:06.442
You have courage.

33:08.195 --> 33:09.737
I'm Viking.

33:13.408 --> 33:14.992
Sailing south by south-east,

33:15.076 --> 33:16.911
we come upon
the mouth of the Seine.

33:18.079 --> 33:19.747
The gateway to Paris.

33:20.957 --> 33:22.958
Several rivers
empty themselves
into the sea,

33:23.043 --> 33:26.128
and the reefs
and mudflats are dangerous.

33:26.213 --> 33:28.214
But here is the entrance.

33:29.758 --> 33:32.343
The entrance to paradise.

34:24.646 --> 34:25.854
Floki.

34:27.315 --> 34:28.774
Floki, what are
you doing?

34:28.858 --> 34:30.276
I have had a sign.

34:30.610 --> 34:31.819
A sign for what?

34:31.903 --> 34:33.821
A sign that blood
must be spilled.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.990
A sacrifice be made.

34:36.074 --> 34:38.409
I have waited a long
time for such a sign.

34:40.662 --> 34:43.747
And now my purpose
is clear.

34:44.582 --> 34:45.749
What purpose?

34:45.834 --> 34:47.001
It is not for you to know.

34:48.586 --> 34:50.587
Some men lust
for women, Helga.

34:50.672 --> 34:52.131
Others lust for gold.

34:52.215 --> 34:53.924
But I only lust
to please the gods.

34:54.009 --> 34:56.176
You must tell me what
you are going to do.

34:56.261 --> 34:59.179
I will only say that
I am going away for a while.

34:59.264 --> 35:00.806
But no one must see me leave

35:00.890 --> 35:03.934
and you must never tell
anyone of my going.

35:04.019 --> 35:05.477
Do you swear?

35:06.271 --> 35:07.730
Do you swear!

35:21.328 --> 35:23.370
I didn't mean to hurt you.

35:24.539 --> 35:25.914
No. I know.

35:27.042 --> 35:29.668
But I think you mean
to hurt someone.

36:38.113 --> 36:39.279
Bjorn.

36:43.743 --> 36:46.036
I'm sorry I have
disturbed you.

36:48.581 --> 36:50.457
Don't be sorry.

36:56.297 --> 36:58.173
I love my wife, Torvi.

39:39.961 --> 39:41.128
Floki.

39:42.797 --> 39:44.006
Priest.

39:49.596 --> 39:51.805
Lord, receive my soul.

42:02.228 --> 42:04.187
The things I do for you.

42:14.907 --> 42:19.286
For such
a little man, Athelstan,
you are terribly heavy.

42:51.444 --> 42:54.779
This is as close to your God
as I can get you.

43:19.096 --> 43:21.389
I never knew
what a martyr was.

43:23.267 --> 43:24.768
I still don't.

43:29.607 --> 43:31.942
You were a brave man,
Athelstan.

43:32.902 --> 43:35.237
I always respected you
for that.

43:38.950 --> 43:40.825
You taught me so much.

43:44.330 --> 43:46.289
You saw yourself
as weak and conflicted,

43:46.374 --> 43:50.043
but to me you were fearless
because you dared to question.

43:57.385 --> 43:59.386
Why did you have to die?

44:02.306 --> 44:04.724
We had so much more
to talk about.

44:15.403 --> 44:20.156
I always believed
that death is a fate
far better than life,

44:21.325 --> 44:24.327
for you will be reunited
with lost loved ones.

44:27.081 --> 44:29.791
We will never meet again,
my friend,

44:31.502 --> 44:33.003
for I have a feeling
that your God

44:33.087 --> 44:36.172
might object to me
visiting you in heaven.

44:41.262 --> 44:43.179
What am I to do now, mmm?

44:46.267 --> 44:48.310
I hate you for leaving me.

44:54.609 --> 44:56.443
I ache from your loss.

44:58.779 --> 45:01.489
There is nothing
that can console me now.

45:02.950 --> 45:04.451
I am changed.

45:06.370 --> 45:07.746
So are you.

45:54.377 --> 45:56.252
Forgive me, my friend,

45:57.588 --> 45:59.881
not for what I have done,

46:02.593 --> 46:18.733
but for what I am
about to do.
