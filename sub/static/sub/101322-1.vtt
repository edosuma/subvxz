was Sienna.

14:38.747 --> 14:40.618
But I thought... You know,

14:40.662 --> 14:44.579

with his friends,
and I just assumed.

14:45.536 --> 14:46.929

I was a drag queen?

- Okay, so just listen and stop
being such a dick.

16:05.181 --> 16:09.142
Okay... Sorry, the chicken
was totally overcooked.

16:09.185 --> 16:12.145
- Oh, it's Cajun-style.

16:12.188 --> 16:15.583
A little blackened
around the edges is all.

16:15.626 --> 16:18.760
- Well, desert will be better.
It's my specialty.
Shall I serve it?

16:18.803 --> 16:20.153
Yeah.

16:21.545 --> 16:22.851
- So bitchy.

16:24.505 --> 16:28.335
- Let me help.
- No, no, no. You sit down.
You're my guest.

16:35.342 --> 16:37.344
- I'm not here
to fight with you,

16:37.387 --> 16:40.608
but I did know my son
for most of his life.

16:40.651 --> 16:42.523
But you're right.

16:42.566 --> 16:46.657
I didn't know who he became
when he moved here,
I only knew the boy.

16:46.701 --> 16:49.051
- You disowned him.

16:49.095 --> 16:51.880
- No, I did not.

16:52.446 --> 16:55.057
- This, my specialty...

16:57.103 --> 16:59.105
...it's my own creation.

16:59.148 --> 17:00.932
I call it Banana Climax.

17:09.723 --> 17:11.204
- Delicious.

17:11.247 --> 17:14.076
- Mm, yeah, it doesn't suck.
- Thank you.

17:15.077 --> 17:17.036
My secret ingredient
is resentment.

17:17.079 --> 17:19.038
And a shit ton of baby food.

17:19.080 --> 17:21.953
Right?
And a shit ton of baby food,
is it?

17:26.088 --> 17:29.439
- I want you to know
I never stopped loving my son.

17:29.483 --> 17:32.181
Would you let me see
where he lived?

17:32.877 --> 17:34.966
Show me... your home?

17:37.708 --> 17:39.667
- Fine.

17:40.711 --> 17:42.235
- What, now?

17:42.278 --> 17:44.889
- It's now or never.

17:46.674 --> 17:48.110
- Go!

17:54.508 --> 17:56.423
- Well...

17:56.466 --> 17:58.381
here...

17:58.425 --> 17:59.991
we are.

18:01.732 --> 18:03.821
Those are his things,
if you want to scavenge
through them.

18:03.865 --> 18:05.345
There's more in the closet.

18:06.520 --> 18:08.348
- You're getting rid
of all of it?

18:08.391 --> 18:10.915
- Donating to AIDS hospice.

18:10.959 --> 18:12.439
- You waste no time.

18:12.482 --> 18:14.571
- Welcome to the real world,
lady.

18:14.615 --> 18:18.097
I have to move out in a week.
I can't afford this place
on my own.

18:18.967 --> 18:21.274
- Move where?
- I don't know.

18:21.317 --> 18:23.145
I lived here for two years,

18:23.189 --> 18:25.974
but Rickey lived here for eight,
so the lease was in his name,

18:26.017 --> 18:28.498
and the landlord wants
to jack the rent.

18:28.542 --> 18:31.588
I could fight it,
but even if I did win,
I can't afford it.

18:32.763 --> 18:34.504
You know what? Here.

18:36.550 --> 18:38.247
Here.

18:39.335 --> 18:42.947
They won't let me touch
his bank accounts or the lease

18:42.991 --> 18:45.602
or the electric bill
or the phone bill.

18:45.646 --> 18:48.779
Everything is in his name
and I'm not next of kin.

18:48.823 --> 18:51.782
There's no will,
and we weren't married,

18:51.826 --> 18:56.135
because he wouldn't marry me
until you would be there.

18:56.178 --> 18:59.399
Didn't want to get married
without his mommy.
That's what he said.

19:00.008 --> 19:01.879
That eventually
you'd come around,

19:01.923 --> 19:05.492
and... here you are
just a few days too late.

19:06.362 --> 19:09.670
Oh, yeah, he never stopped
loving you either.

19:09.713 --> 19:12.063
Even when I begged him to.

19:13.021 --> 19:14.283
There you go.

19:15.893 --> 19:19.158
- What's that?
- The lease, keys,
inventory, contracts.

19:19.810 --> 19:21.508
Rickey owned the bar.

19:21.551 --> 19:24.511
- The bar?
- The club.

19:24.554 --> 19:26.295
The one we managed together?

19:26.339 --> 19:28.123
Pandora's Box.

19:29.037 --> 19:30.734
- Oh, my Lord.

19:30.778 --> 19:33.172
- My home.
Everything I worked for,

19:33.215 --> 19:35.217
everything I own - all yours.

19:35.261 --> 19:37.567
That's what the lawyer said.

19:37.611 --> 19:41.136
- Oh, my Lord,
I've inherited a gay bar.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.659
- Congratulations.

19:42.703 --> 19:45.532
- Why, I don't want it.
- Well, you've got it!

19:46.881 --> 19:48.752
I gotta get ready for work.

19:50.058 --> 19:51.625
- Take me with you.
I gotta see it.

19:53.061 --> 19:55.106
- Have you ever been
to a gay bar?

19:56.282 --> 19:58.327

that she has a great head

21:11.357 --> 21:14.621

quite a figure for head.

22:00.188 --> 22:03.191
- But that's the problem.
Nobody knows what's going on
with this place.

22:33.656 --> 22:36.616
maybe they were just coming

I never realized how much
he looked like you.

22:44.885 --> 22:46.843
I think
you were his inspiration.

22:49.455 --> 22:51.979
On stage, he was a real bitch.

22:55.461 --> 22:57.419
- Me? Heh, no.

22:58.246 --> 23:00.117
A little karaoke sometimes.

23:00.161 --> 23:01.641
I ran the business side;

23:01.684 --> 23:04.034
Rickey was creative.

23:04.078 --> 23:06.733
He put everything he had
into this place.

- I don't mind.

24:29.729 --> 24:31.992
Might do me some good.

24:32.035 --> 24:34.037
- So there's breast milk

All from this one;
this one's on strike.

Okay, I'll call you.

- Bye.

24:47.703 --> 24:48.965
Hey.

24:49.009 --> 24:50.967
- Hello.
- Jeb, hi.

24:51.011 --> 24:53.404
- I thought I'd hear from you
before now.

24:53.448 --> 24:55.102
- They're keeping me busy,
darling.

24:55.145 --> 24:56.625
- How was the memorial?

24:58.018 --> 25:01.064
- You would've been...
very moved.

25:02.544 --> 25:04.241
I'm gonna stay a little longer.

25:04.285 --> 25:07.070
Would you please
put some money
in the joint account?

25:08.376 --> 25:10.247
- How much longer?

25:10.291 --> 25:12.423
- I dunno. A few days.

25:13.555 --> 25:15.557
Five thousand, maybe ten?

25:15.601 --> 25:17.559
- Five thousand?!

25:17.603 --> 25:19.822
- Well, there's legal fees
and...

25:19.866 --> 25:22.346
and... and other expenses
and whatnot.

25:24.044 --> 25:26.699
- Well, I hope
this doesn't become a habit.

25:26.742 --> 25:29.528
- It's not gonna become a habit,
Jeb.

25:29.571 --> 25:32.705
I'm only gonna bury my son
the once.

25:32.748 --> 25:34.445
- Look, for 50 bucks--

25:39.668 --> 25:41.583
- Please get this
to your landlord.

25:41.627 --> 25:44.586
That should cover your rent
for a couple months.

25:48.329 --> 25:50.113
- I don't want
to take your money.

25:52.202 --> 25:54.901
- It's Rickey's money.
I got it from his bank.

25:57.599 --> 26:00.384
I won't see you homeless
on my account.

26:01.211 --> 26:04.127
- You expect me to be grateful
for giving me back
my own money?

26:06.216 --> 26:09.872
- I've also decided
to let the club stay open

26:09.916 --> 26:12.048
for two months as a trial.

26:12.092 --> 26:16.009
- Trial for what?
- I can't in good conscience
even speak to my husband

26:16.052 --> 26:18.533
about not selling the business
if it's losing money.

26:18.577 --> 26:20.491
And think of it
as Rickey's legacy.

26:20.535 --> 26:22.493
Rickey would want it
to be successful.

26:22.537 --> 26:25.627
- No, I'd rather sell the place
than work for you.

26:27.020 --> 26:28.630
- Think of us
as business partners.

26:28.674 --> 26:30.676
And consider Sienna.

26:30.719 --> 26:35.071
I can sleep on her sofa
and take care of baby Rickey
during the day.

26:35.115 --> 26:37.639
- That would be amazing.
I'd love that.

26:39.032 --> 26:41.643
- What do you know
about running a drag bar?

26:41.687 --> 26:43.514
- I'm a Southern Baptist
choir mistress.

26:44.733 --> 26:46.692
Different songs, same divas.

26:46.735 --> 26:49.738
Some of the same wigs, too.

26:49.782 --> 26:52.959
- Just take the deal
for the both of us.

26:53.002 --> 26:54.656
- That is my bar!

26:54.700 --> 26:58.138
Rickey warned me about you,
but he didn't do you justice.

26:58.181 --> 27:01.402
I'm gonna find out
what you're after,
you conniving bitch.

27:02.490 --> 27:03.883
- I don't connive.

27:05.406 --> 27:07.669
I scheme.
I'm a scheming bitch.

27:17.418 --> 27:19.638
- We'll nail it tonight.

27:19.681 --> 27:23.032
- Should I tweet our followers
that we have
a new closing number?

27:23.076 --> 27:24.555
- Twat away.

27:24.599 --> 27:26.122
Smell her.

27:26.732 --> 27:28.908
And did you get a load
of that accent?

27:28.951 --> 27:32.172
And her name is Maybelline,
for chrissake.

27:32.215 --> 27:36.393
I'd probably like it better
if it were Loreal.

27:36.437 --> 27:39.483
- So is Mommy Dearest
gonna be our new boss?

27:39.527 --> 27:41.442
- She does own the place now.

27:41.485 --> 27:44.053
- Any direction at this point
would be nice.

27:44.097 --> 27:46.360
Uh, Mama Metcalf?

27:46.403 --> 27:48.492
I'm Dusty.

27:48.536 --> 27:52.148
Or Roger, if you prefer it,
but I prefer Dusty.

27:53.106 --> 27:55.325
I was Rickey's drag mother.

27:56.762 --> 27:59.982
A drag mother...
shows a younger queen the ropes,

28:00.026 --> 28:02.158
teaches her
the rules of etiquette,

28:02.202 --> 28:05.118
and helps bring out the queen
from within.

28:05.161 --> 28:07.381
- We're sorry for your loss.

28:08.077 --> 28:10.645
I'm Eric.
- Hi, Eric.

28:12.342 --> 28:15.258
I heard you sing at his funeral.
It was beautiful.

28:15.302 --> 28:17.521
Thank you.
It really touched my heart.

28:17.565 --> 28:18.958
- I'm Joan.

28:19.001 --> 28:21.612
- You have a boy name?
- Just Joan.

28:22.222 --> 28:24.137
- Nice to meet you, Joan.

28:24.180 --> 28:28.358
- I'm Cherry.
We all loved Rickey very much.
- Um, do we still have jobs?

28:28.402 --> 28:30.186
- Okay, look.

28:30.230 --> 28:32.014
I'm still in charge here.

28:32.058 --> 28:35.322
Think of Mrs. Metcalf
as a silent partner.

28:35.365 --> 28:39.195
- Uh, good, because I don't take
orders from amateurs.

28:39.239 --> 28:42.024
- You want direction, Dusty?

28:42.068 --> 28:43.896
I'll give you direction.

28:43.939 --> 28:45.724
Rehearse more.

28:46.376 --> 28:47.813
- Pay me more.

28:47.856 --> 28:50.293
- Your lip-syncing sucks.

28:50.337 --> 28:54.297
You've gotten too lazy to move
and face the music,
if you can hear the music.

28:54.341 --> 28:56.430
It's not like you're packing
them in these days.

28:56.473 --> 28:57.648
- Oh, God.

28:59.346 --> 29:01.827
- Alright, now, look.
I don't want to speak ill
of the dead,

29:01.870 --> 29:04.786
we all loved Rickey,
but let's be honest -

29:04.830 --> 29:06.919
he had not been himself
in a long time.

29:06.962 --> 29:10.052
And his fans - ourfans -

29:10.096 --> 29:12.707
did not want to watch
their star burn out.

29:13.403 --> 29:15.492
So we are without a director,

29:15.536 --> 29:17.233
without a star.

29:17.277 --> 29:19.845
We have to put
a whole new show together.

29:19.888 --> 29:23.065
So if you want to keep
this place going without him,

29:23.109 --> 29:24.806
you need
to pull yourself together.

29:24.850 --> 29:29.115
If I'm not appreciated
after all these years...

29:30.116 --> 29:31.595
...I quit.

29:33.206 --> 29:34.990
- Dusty, wait.

29:35.034 --> 29:36.862
Everyone's upset.

29:36.905 --> 29:38.951
I understand...

29:38.994 --> 29:41.083
what it is to be older.

29:42.868 --> 29:44.347
- Older?

29:45.871 --> 29:49.962
This place was your baby's
dream, his vision.

29:51.833 --> 29:53.530
Maybe it should die with him.

30:00.015 --> 30:02.191
- After practice tomorrow,

30:02.235 --> 30:04.933
you can talk to us
about your ideas... boss.

30:33.179 --> 30:35.137
Hi.

30:35.181 --> 30:36.965
- Hmm. Morning.

30:38.053 --> 30:40.012
- I love that lipstick colour.

30:40.055 --> 30:43.537
- You know what? I could get you
any shade of lipstick
with my discount.

30:43.580 --> 30:47.236
I know it's a little cliché,
a blond bimbo selling cosmetics,

30:47.280 --> 30:50.326
but... it's the only job I have
right now.

30:50.370 --> 30:52.459
It's all commissions.

30:52.502 --> 30:55.288
Listen, I don't know how long
you're staying for, but, uh,

30:55.331 --> 30:57.420
I was thinking...
200 a week seems fair.

30:58.944 --> 31:00.989
You don't have to pay me.

31:01.033 --> 31:02.991
- For rent.

31:04.079 --> 31:05.907
- For a sofa?

31:05.951 --> 31:08.301
- In this neighbourhood,
I could get twice the amount
for a loveseat.

31:09.737 --> 31:11.130
- Oh.

31:12.914 --> 31:14.698
- Morning, Bear.

31:14.742 --> 31:16.135
Take a look at this.

31:17.963 --> 31:19.573
Morning.

31:22.315 --> 31:24.621
Tequila.

31:24.665 --> 31:26.754
Guys.

31:26.797 --> 31:28.974
- Mrs. Metcalf,
what do you think you're doing?

31:29.017 --> 31:31.237
- This is my idea
for a new show.

31:31.280 --> 31:34.370
- What,
the Southern Gospel Drag Choir?
- The Trans Tabernacle?

31:34.414 --> 31:36.633
- Hey, keep an open mind.

31:36.677 --> 31:40.507
- Sex, Drag and Rock and Roll?
Girl, please.

31:40.550 --> 31:42.074
- What is this, retro night?

31:42.117 --> 31:45.816
- I want y'all to sing.
- Like "sing" sing?

31:46.774 --> 31:48.210
What, really sing?

31:48.254 --> 31:51.083
- I've heard y'all humming along
to the music here.

31:51.126 --> 31:54.434
Believe me, I've made much more
with much less.

31:54.477 --> 31:57.959
- How did you know that Rickey
had that same exact idea?

31:58.003 --> 31:59.569
- I didn't.

31:59.613 --> 32:03.486
- The sex part,
is that gonna be real too? Hmm?

32:03.530 --> 32:04.966
- Listen to me.

32:05.010 --> 32:08.535
How many drag shows are there
in San Francisco?

32:08.578 --> 32:12.234
We need to appeal to the masses,
not just the men
in the neighbourhood.

32:12.278 --> 32:14.715
- And what's wrong with the men
in the neighbourhood?

32:14.758 --> 32:18.893
- Look, millions of tourists
come to San Francisco
every year.

32:18.937 --> 32:23.071
We gotta give them somethin'
they won't see at home.

32:23.115 --> 32:26.727
- Look,
even if we go with your idea,
and I'm not saying that we are,

32:26.770 --> 32:29.991
how do you propose
we get these tourists in here,
Miss Field of Dreams?

32:30.035 --> 32:31.775
- Oh, I love that movie.

32:31.819 --> 32:33.429
- I have a plan.

32:33.473 --> 32:34.996
- I play piano.

32:37.477 --> 32:39.870
- Now,
that's what I'm talking about,
right there.

32:39.914 --> 32:41.307
- Can we share?

32:47.226 --> 32:49.706
- Oh, my Lord, Sienna,

32:49.750 --> 32:53.275
those pants are so tight,
I can see the Promised Land.

32:53.319 --> 32:55.234
- Camel toes are chic right now.

32:57.105 --> 32:59.020
Smells delicious.

32:59.064 --> 33:00.979
- So where's he taking you?

33:01.022 --> 33:05.026
- I dunno.
His name is Grayson
and he's totally my type.

33:06.288 --> 33:08.290
Scruffy, rugged...

33:08.334 --> 33:10.466
- What do you know
about this man?

33:10.510 --> 33:14.253
- I know he's got a dick
and I haven't been laid
in a year.

33:14.296 --> 33:17.256
- You're planning to sleep
with this guy on the first date?

33:17.299 --> 33:18.866
- Hell, yeah.

33:18.909 --> 33:21.912
- Isn't that how you got
yourself into this predicament?

33:21.956 --> 33:25.655
- Listen, you are not my mother.
You're my babysitter.

33:25.699 --> 33:29.137
- I can have an opinion.
- Not about my pussy.

33:30.878 --> 33:32.488
[knocking]

33:35.013 --> 33:37.058
One second.

33:46.372 --> 33:48.287
Hi.

33:52.073 --> 33:55.685
- Maybelline said
to bring dessert,
so I come packing fudge.

33:55.729 --> 33:57.470
- You waited your whole life
to say that line?

33:57.513 --> 33:59.341
Pretty much.

33:59.385 --> 34:01.865
Hi.

34:01.909 --> 34:04.520
Darling.

34:06.479 --> 34:09.221
- I'm not saying the place
he brought me wasn't lovely,

34:09.264 --> 34:11.788
but when I asked him
where the bathroom was,

34:11.831 --> 34:14.226
he said take a left
at the glory hole,

34:14.268 --> 34:16.315
and if you've reached the sling,
you've gone too far.

34:16.358 --> 34:19.056
Girl!

34:20.841 --> 34:22.234
- Glory hole?

34:23.190 --> 34:26.063
- It's like a...
confession booth.

34:26.107 --> 34:28.543
Yeah.

34:29.284 --> 34:32.373
- I can't wait until I'm done
with my transition.

34:32.418 --> 34:35.943
Then maybe I'll have better luck
with the straight guys.

34:35.985 --> 34:39.641
- Oh, honey,
you don't need luck.
You need patience.

34:39.686 --> 34:41.208
- I need me some good wienie.

34:41.253 --> 34:43.864
- Hey...
- Okay?

34:46.127 --> 34:49.913
- Maybelline,
you've been married for a while.

34:49.956 --> 34:51.437
That must feel good.

34:52.525 --> 34:54.092
- Well, I guess.

34:54.135 --> 34:56.355
- Well, I want to be married.

34:56.398 --> 34:58.487
- Oh...!

34:58.531 --> 35:01.099
Well, bitch,
stop going for the closet cases
all the time.

35:03.840 --> 35:05.799
- Oh, my God.

35:08.062 --> 35:09.846
This is gorgeous.

35:09.890 --> 35:11.283
Do you sew?

35:11.326 --> 35:13.154
- Well, you know.
I did some fashion,

35:13.198 --> 35:15.591
back in my more naive times.

35:15.635 --> 35:18.072
- Well, honey, if you can sew,

35:18.116 --> 35:21.293
I need everything that I own
let out.

35:21.336 --> 35:24.165
- You're gonna need a lot
of extra fabric with that one.

35:26.036 --> 35:28.343
- Brutal.
- So catty.

35:28.387 --> 35:30.345
You tried it.

35:31.999 --> 35:33.522
- You, uh, ready?

35:36.612 --> 35:38.832
- Book club.

35:38.875 --> 35:41.051
Okay.

35:44.142 --> 35:46.405
And...

35:52.193 --> 35:53.890
Oh, let's try that again.

35:53.934 --> 35:57.155
What do you think,
little Rickey, one more time?

36:04.205 --> 36:05.859
- Good!
- Oh, yeah!

36:05.902 --> 36:07.948
- Yeah, we got it!

and what's baby food anymore.

38:16.772 --> 38:19.471
- Do all those boys
at the club...

38:19.514 --> 38:21.734
Do I call them boys or girls?

38:21.777 --> 38:23.866
- It's kind of
a time-of-day issue.

38:23.910 --> 38:26.478
- Do all those girls at the club
do drugs?

38:26.521 --> 38:28.697
And was Rickey always high?

38:28.741 --> 38:31.004
- I mean, Rickey drank
and partied too much,

38:31.047 --> 38:33.049
we all did,
but we're not junkies.

38:33.093 --> 38:35.051
People go to nightclubs
to lose themselves.

38:35.095 --> 38:37.706
You might see something
you don't want to see.

38:38.751 --> 38:40.970
- I can handle a gay bar.

38:41.014 --> 38:45.453
All my life I've watched rodeos
and livestock shows,
so a gay bar's nothin'.

38:46.976 --> 38:49.370
I want to buy
some of that lipstick.

38:49.414 --> 38:51.807
- Oh. Okay.

39:00.381 --> 39:02.035
- The way the gilt's...

39:02.078 --> 39:04.951
- No. No, no, no, no, no.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
It's over.

39:04.994 --> 39:07.649
- What?
- Give me that.
- What? What? Hey!

39:07.693 --> 39:10.304
- Give me the fucking brush,
Bear!

39:10.348 --> 39:12.741
- What?!
- You keep changing everything.

39:13.568 --> 39:17.180
Every time you hang a curtain
or throw away old things
for new things,

39:17.224 --> 39:20.227
it's like... he's more gone.

39:20.270 --> 39:21.533
It's stupid.

39:21.576 --> 39:23.273
- Hey, stop!

39:24.013 --> 39:27.060
Wait right there.
I want to show you somethin'.

39:34.023 --> 39:36.199
Look at this, Nathan.
It's Rickey.

39:36.243 --> 39:38.637
I don't think
you've seen that before.

39:39.246 --> 39:41.335
In his room.
He was a teenager then,

39:41.379 --> 39:43.076
and he was getting moody,

39:43.119 --> 39:45.905
throwing hissy fits
with his daddy, and...

39:45.948 --> 39:47.559
to cheer him up,

39:47.602 --> 39:50.692
I told him
he could paint his room
any colour he wanted.

39:50.736 --> 39:53.129
And... and so...

39:53.173 --> 39:56.655
I thought we'd paint the walls
his favourite colour

39:56.698 --> 39:59.222
and... with your permission,

39:59.266 --> 40:01.964
we could hang that photo
on the wall so...

40:03.052 --> 40:05.098
...he would never miss a show.

40:24.857 --> 40:26.685
- Can I help you?
- Thank you.

40:26.728 --> 40:32.038
Yes, um... I was wondering
if you would be, uh...

40:32.081 --> 40:33.779
willing to spread the word

40:33.822 --> 40:36.172
about a terrific show
at our club,

40:36.216 --> 40:38.784
Pandora's Box.
It's quite unique.

40:38.827 --> 40:40.916
- That's a drag bar, right?

40:40.960 --> 40:43.441
- Well, we have
gender illusionists--

40:43.484 --> 40:45.051
- No, thanks,
we're not interested.

40:45.094 --> 40:47.488
- Oh. Well...

40:48.228 --> 40:50.317
...could I give you some flyers?

40:50.360 --> 40:52.275
- Uh, there's no soliciting.

40:52.319 --> 40:53.755
- Oh.
- Thanks.

40:53.799 --> 40:56.236
- Okay. Thank you.

40:56.932 --> 40:58.368
Oh.

41:00.545 --> 41:02.155
Oh, I'm so sorry.

41:02.198 --> 41:05.898
- Oh, it's not a problem.
- This is very kind of you.

41:05.941 --> 41:10.250
The only way to get my flyers
distributed in your hotel.
[chuckling]

41:10.293 --> 41:12.818
- You're from Texas.
- You got it.

41:12.861 --> 41:14.776
Small town called Red Vine.

41:14.820 --> 41:17.736
- I spent some summers
in Savage Springs as a boy,

41:17.779 --> 41:19.868
a couple hours from there.

41:19.912 --> 41:21.609
Head concierge.

41:21.653 --> 41:23.481
August.

41:23.524 --> 41:26.484
- How do you do?
I'm Maybelline Metcalf.

41:29.269 --> 41:31.271
- You work at a drag club?

41:31.314 --> 41:34.100
- Well, actually, I own it.
It's a long story.

41:34.143 --> 41:37.538
- Well, I'd be interested
in hearing that story sometime.

41:38.931 --> 41:42.891
Is the show any good?
We're always looking
for things to recommend.

41:42.935 --> 41:45.807
- Oh, well, why don't you come
judge for yourself?

41:45.851 --> 41:49.463
A week from Saturday,
we're putting on
a brand-new show.

41:49.507 --> 41:51.683
I'll put you on the guest list.

41:51.726 --> 41:54.860
- Not my typical Saturday night,
but...

41:54.903 --> 41:56.818
sounds fun.

41:56.862 --> 41:59.342
Sure. Why not?

41:59.386 --> 42:00.779
- Great.

42:01.780 --> 42:03.346
Thanks again.

42:03.390 --> 42:04.783
- Bye.

42:21.974 --> 42:24.585
- Wow, this place looks amazing,
Maybelline.

42:24.629 --> 42:27.240
You really do have Rickey's eye.

42:27.893 --> 42:29.677
- Or he had mine.

to officially recommend the show
to all the guests.

45:46.787 --> 45:48.223
Bye.

45:48.267 --> 45:50.008
- Wow, he must've really liked
the show.

45:50.051 --> 45:53.141
It's not all he likes.

45:53.185 --> 45:56.014
- Oh, stop.
I'm a married woman.

45:56.057 --> 45:57.537
- Mm-hmm.

46:03.717 --> 46:06.198
- Well, I'd like to go through
all your closets,

46:06.241 --> 46:08.766
but I also think we should make
something new.

46:08.809 --> 46:11.029
You know,
debut something original?

46:11.638 --> 46:14.815
Off the rack in size 18
ain't exactly couture.

46:18.036 --> 46:20.473
Ma'am, it's not polite to stare.

46:23.084 --> 46:24.999
- Hmm. It's alright.

46:27.349 --> 46:29.090
It's my mother.

46:37.272 --> 46:39.622
- Well,
let's get this party started.

46:39.666 --> 46:42.060
Oh, Lord.

46:45.237 --> 46:48.066
- Is that your husband?
You're gonna have to talk
to him sometime.

46:48.109 --> 46:50.633
- I know, but not tonight.

46:51.156 --> 46:54.812
I don't feel like holding up
both ends of the conversation.
[chuckling]

46:54.855 --> 46:57.292
Okay. This?

46:57.336 --> 46:59.294
- Hey, where's Joan tonight?

47:03.429 --> 47:05.735
- Joan's not feeling her best
tonight.

47:05.779 --> 47:07.433
- Oh.

47:07.476 --> 47:09.130
Poor thing.

47:09.174 --> 47:12.568
- Yeah.
Now let's see if we can get you
some action tonight.

47:12.612 --> 47:15.397
- Hey, it's a business dinner.

47:15.441 --> 47:19.314
- This one's good, huh?
- Oh, I don't think so. Not red.

47:19.358 --> 47:23.188
- If it looks good on me,
it could look good on you, huh?
[laughter]

47:26.756 --> 47:29.759
- I like this music.
- You should hear it on vinyl.

47:29.803 --> 47:32.240
- Vinyl? You're old-school.

47:33.720 --> 47:37.855
- Every Saturday I'd go
to this great vinyl-record store
in Haight-Ashbury

47:37.898 --> 47:40.335
and treat myself
to a new treasure.

47:40.379 --> 47:43.904
- You were one of the cool guys
in high school, weren't you?

47:45.297 --> 47:47.342
- And you were
that beautiful girl

47:47.386 --> 47:50.563
too busy cheering
the football team to notice me.

47:53.218 --> 47:56.438
- Do you mind if we make
a couple of quick stops
on the way?

48:00.399 --> 48:01.879
Hi, Joan.

48:01.922 --> 48:03.706
- Maybelline.

48:03.750 --> 48:07.101
I heard you were sick,
so I brought you some soup
from Whole Foods.

48:07.145 --> 48:09.974
It costs a month's rent,
so it must be good.

48:10.017 --> 48:11.889
Thank you.

48:11.932 --> 48:13.499
You...

48:13.542 --> 48:15.240
you look like a drag queen.

48:16.937 --> 48:19.113
- May I come in for a minute?

48:19.157 --> 48:21.811
August is waiting outside.
It won't take long.

48:27.252 --> 48:30.211
- Sorry. The place is a mess.

48:30.255 --> 48:32.039
I'm an even bigger mess.

48:33.258 --> 48:35.086
- Don't worry.

48:35.129 --> 48:38.828
Where I come from, people leave
their old sofas on the porch.

48:42.006 --> 48:43.964
Joan, I'm worried about you.

48:45.966 --> 48:49.665
Maybe you don't think
you have a problem,
but from what I hear,

48:49.709 --> 48:53.321
Rickey thought
he didn't have a problem either.

48:53.365 --> 48:55.193
- Rickey and I were a lot alike.

48:57.369 --> 48:59.197
We used to...

49:00.024 --> 49:02.504
...blow sailors together
back in the day.

49:06.160 --> 49:08.641
- You can't shock me, Joan.
Not anymore.

49:18.303 --> 49:20.000
- Maybe I'll stop.

49:22.002 --> 49:25.136
It's just that it makes shit
so much easier to handle.

49:25.179 --> 49:27.660
- Tell me what's so hard.

49:27.703 --> 49:29.444
I don't know.

49:32.491 --> 49:36.408
I mean, I haven't had
a relationship... in six years.

49:38.018 --> 49:39.977
It's not for a lack
of meeting people,

49:40.020 --> 49:42.457
it's just the more
that I hook up,
the lonelier I feel.

49:43.415 --> 49:46.896
- I don't want to lose you,
Joan, not like we lost Rickey.

49:48.420 --> 49:52.685
Besides, you're much prettier
when you're not using
that stuff.

49:56.428 --> 49:58.647
- Me and Rickey were Dusty's
drag daughters.

49:59.866 --> 50:01.694
She's been sober forever.

50:01.737 --> 50:05.698
She was always trying to get
me and Rickey to go to meetings
with her.

50:05.741 --> 50:08.005
- You two should have
a girl's night out.

50:09.049 --> 50:11.791
- Dusty's not really talking
to any of us now.

50:11.834 --> 50:13.488
No.

50:18.885 --> 50:20.365
- That was Rickey's.

50:21.366 --> 50:24.151
Nathan wanted me to have it
because I was Rickey's sister.

50:27.241 --> 50:29.069
He called it "the Maybelline."

50:30.114 --> 50:33.204
- Can you give me everything
you have in this apartment?

50:33.247 --> 50:35.293
I mean all the drugs.

50:35.336 --> 50:38.600
- Maybelline--
- Nobody intervened for my son.

50:39.253 --> 50:41.299
I'm intervening for you.

51:04.844 --> 51:06.193
Is that all of it?

51:07.716 --> 51:09.109
- That's what I've got.

51:38.878 --> 51:40.184
I would've.

51:41.968 --> 51:44.927
- Would've what?
- Noticed you in high school.

51:52.326 --> 51:54.807
- I moved out here
the day after graduation.

51:55.460 --> 51:57.810
I was a hippy.

51:57.853 --> 52:01.118
I came here for the free love.
[both chuckling]

52:02.336 --> 52:06.166
Only thing about me
that didn't get old is my love
for this place.

52:08.473 --> 52:10.736
The Bay.

52:10.779 --> 52:12.781
The hills.

52:12.825 --> 52:14.957
The fighting spirit.

52:17.351 --> 52:19.397
My favourite city in the world.

52:21.747 --> 52:24.184
I always feel lucky to be here.

52:27.187 --> 52:29.146
Especially tonight.

52:31.670 --> 52:33.976
You sure you don't want me
to take you home?

52:34.020 --> 52:35.413
- No, I'm fine.

52:37.197 --> 52:39.286
- I'll wait for you.
- No, no.

52:40.200 --> 52:42.985
But that was...

52:43.029 --> 52:45.771
the most wonderful evening
I've had

52:45.814 --> 52:47.555
in I can't remember when.

52:58.610 --> 53:00.177
Thank you.

53:02.396 --> 53:03.876
Good night.

53:08.228 --> 53:11.753
I was wondering,
if you don't mind...

53:13.059 --> 53:15.017
...may I sit with you tonight?

55:16.095 --> 55:17.488
Hi.

55:17.531 --> 55:20.708
- Ooh, someone got lucky
last night.

55:20.752 --> 55:23.624
- Yeah,
I got very lucky last night.

55:23.668 --> 55:25.322
- Hoo-hoo-hoo!

55:42.991 --> 55:44.515
- What is it, Cherry?

55:44.558 --> 55:47.169
- I was turned down
for surgery again.

55:47.213 --> 55:48.649
- Oh, I'm sorry.

55:48.693 --> 55:49.955
How come?

55:49.998 --> 55:52.000
- 'Cause I haven't told my wife.

55:53.785 --> 55:56.744
- Is your wife...
visually impaired?

55:58.442 --> 56:01.532
- I haven't seen my wife
in five or six years or so.

56:01.575 --> 56:03.055
- Oh.

56:04.404 --> 56:06.101
- I need a divorce.

56:06.145 --> 56:08.539
That's...
that's just the simple way.

56:08.582 --> 56:11.846
- She won't give you a divorce?
- I haven't asked.

56:11.890 --> 56:13.370
She doesn't know.

56:13.413 --> 56:15.067
- You should tell her in person.

56:15.110 --> 56:18.200
You shouldn't let
a dead marriage hold you back.

56:18.244 --> 56:20.202
- I already hurt her so much.

56:20.246 --> 56:21.769
- If I were her,
I'd want to know.

56:21.813 --> 56:24.511
It might help her to see
what you've been through.

56:26.426 --> 56:28.123
- You think?

56:28.167 --> 56:32.214
- If you like, I could go
with you for moral support.

56:32.258 --> 56:35.304
- Yeah... I shouldn't go alone.

01:00:00.074 --> 01:00:02.120
Hey!

01:00:02.163 --> 01:00:05.427
- Who the fuck are you?
Don't fuckin' wave that thing
at me.

01:00:05.471 --> 01:00:08.126
- Oh, I don't wave, I aim.
- Alright.

01:00:08.169 --> 01:00:12.173
Why don't you turn around and
leave the scene while you can.
- Shut up! Let her go!

01:00:12.217 --> 01:00:15.307
Let her go!

01:00:19.659 --> 01:00:21.487
Now when I say,

01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:24.403
you're gonna go out that door
and never come back.

01:00:25.491 --> 01:00:28.146
And if I hear
you so much as text Sienna,

01:00:28.189 --> 01:00:30.801
I'm going straight to the police
to file charges,

01:00:30.844 --> 01:00:35.196
and I'm going to your boss
to tell her about your previous
problems with the law.

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:38.025
- So, what,
you're gonna fucking kill me
over a couple slaps?

01:00:38.069 --> 01:00:43.248
- No! I kill you because
dropping a woman beater
is on my bucket list.

01:00:44.423 --> 01:00:47.687
Now get your ass outta here
before I put another hole in it.

01:00:57.436 --> 01:00:59.046
Jesus. Fuck.

01:01:03.703 --> 01:01:05.705

01:01:09.622 --> 01:01:11.711
Not too much pressure

01:01:15.323 --> 01:01:17.151
Do you want to go to the police?

01:01:19.110 --> 01:01:21.721
- I already have
one restraining order,
I don't want another.

01:01:23.897 --> 01:01:25.594
They'd take his side anyway.

01:01:29.468 --> 01:01:32.601
How'd you know he had
a previous brush with the law?

01:01:33.124 --> 01:01:35.169
- I didn't. Just guessed.

01:01:40.348 --> 01:01:42.611
- Would you stay in here
with me tonight?

01:01:44.483 --> 01:01:45.745
- Sure.

01:01:51.751 --> 01:01:53.971
- He said
that he liked it rough.

01:01:58.932 --> 01:02:00.629
And I said okay...

01:02:06.766 --> 01:02:08.420
...but I didn't like it.

01:02:10.944 --> 01:02:12.641
And then he got mad.

01:02:16.515 --> 01:02:17.995
I'm such a mess.

01:02:20.171 --> 01:02:22.782
- When a man says
he likes it rough...

01:02:23.957 --> 01:02:26.568
...kick him in the balls
and see if it's true.

01:02:53.117 --> 01:02:54.771
Good morning.

01:02:55.293 --> 01:02:56.903
Good mornin'.

01:02:57.643 --> 01:02:59.166
How's my boy?

01:02:59.210 --> 01:03:01.690
How's my Rickey? Eh?

01:03:14.486 --> 01:03:16.053
- What can I get you?

01:03:17.271 --> 01:03:19.317
- Please.

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:21.275
Please sit down?

01:03:21.319 --> 01:03:23.190
Just for a minute.

01:03:28.848 --> 01:03:30.807
I'm Maybelline Metcalf.

01:03:30.850 --> 01:03:33.374
I work with your son, Eric.

01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:36.116
- What do you want?

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:39.685
- I want you to come see
our show as a guest.

01:03:39.728 --> 01:03:41.295
Please don't.

01:03:41.905 --> 01:03:44.951
I understand
what you're going through.

01:03:48.041 --> 01:03:49.913
My son, Rickey...

01:03:51.044 --> 01:03:53.873
...he did not turn out
like I thought he would.

01:03:54.613 --> 01:03:56.310
Like I wanted.

01:03:56.354 --> 01:03:58.138
And when things got tough,

01:03:58.182 --> 01:04:01.750
I chose not to see him
for many years,

01:04:01.794 --> 01:04:04.275
because I wanted him to change.

01:04:06.277 --> 01:04:08.409
And I never did see him again.

01:04:09.236 --> 01:04:11.456
He died.

01:04:11.499 --> 01:04:13.893
And he left me that nightclub,

01:04:13.937 --> 01:04:16.765
and that's how...
I know your son.

01:04:17.897 --> 01:04:20.508
And Eric is...

01:04:20.552 --> 01:04:22.119
a fine young man.

01:04:23.511 --> 01:04:26.688
You raised Eric
to be sweet and kind,

01:04:26.732 --> 01:04:27.994
and...

01:04:29.909 --> 01:04:32.259
...he doesn't hurt anybody.

01:04:34.914 --> 01:04:36.568
I would give...

01:04:37.525 --> 01:04:40.702
...anything...
to see my son again.

01:04:41.094 --> 01:04:42.704
Just once.

01:04:44.402 --> 01:04:47.579
I don't want you to feel
that same way someday.

01:04:58.764 --> 01:05:00.548
- What can I get you?

01:05:01.419 --> 01:05:03.725
- Oh.

01:05:03.769 --> 01:05:05.336
How's the chicken club?

01:05:06.946 --> 01:05:08.730
- Very good.
- Okay.

01:05:08.774 --> 01:05:10.167
Thank you.

01:05:15.999 --> 01:05:17.914
- Hey, May.

01:05:17.957 --> 01:05:20.612
- Oh, hi. Good to see you again.

01:05:21.787 --> 01:05:25.312
Say, what do you think
about free drinks
for all the girls tonight?

01:05:25.356 --> 01:05:28.489
- There go your profits.
- Oh, well.

01:05:29.795 --> 01:05:33.320
Listen, can you make sure all
the mics are working tonight?

01:05:33.364 --> 01:05:36.193
- Yeah, I'll triple-check them,
Maybelline.

01:05:48.857 --> 01:05:50.424
- How y'all doing?

01:05:53.471 --> 01:05:55.081
- Oh. Jittery.

01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:59.564
I-I'm stone-cold sober.
I'm just nervous.

01:05:59.607 --> 01:06:03.568
- Well, aren't we lucky to care
about something enough
to be nervous about it?

01:06:03.611 --> 01:06:06.571
Channel those nerves
and you'll be great. Okay.

01:06:06.614 --> 01:06:08.138
- Okay.
- See ya.

01:06:08.181 --> 01:06:10.140
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:06:47.525 --> 01:06:49.266
In here, Jeb.

01:06:51.355 --> 01:06:54.401
- What the hell
is goin' on here, Maybelline?

01:06:54.445 --> 01:06:56.577
- This was Rickey's club.

01:06:56.621 --> 01:06:58.057
- Yeah, so I gather.

01:06:59.232 --> 01:07:01.539
- Who'd you talk to?
- The lawyer.

01:07:01.582 --> 01:07:03.062
Certainly not you.

01:07:04.063 --> 01:07:06.848
- Well, it's been overwhelming.

01:07:07.806 --> 01:07:10.678
- We inherited a gay bar.
You forgot to tell me?

01:07:12.071 --> 01:07:14.030
- I didn't think
you'd be interested.

01:07:14.987 --> 01:07:18.034
- I'm interested in selling it,
going home with my wife.

01:07:18.077 --> 01:07:20.079
- The show's just opened.

01:07:20.123 --> 01:07:23.039
It's too soon to tell
whether tonight's full house

01:07:23.082 --> 01:07:24.953
will translate
into more full houses.

01:07:24.997 --> 01:07:28.522
I can't leave now, not when
it's just turnin' a profit.

01:07:28.566 --> 01:07:30.089
- It's been weeks.

01:07:30.133 --> 01:07:32.091
Our house is empty.

01:07:32.744 --> 01:07:34.180
Dead quiet.

01:07:35.703 --> 01:07:38.054
- Well, play some Johnny Cash.

01:07:42.014 --> 01:07:43.581
- I love you.

01:07:50.283 --> 01:07:51.763
- Okay.

01:07:53.112 --> 01:07:55.549
I'll come back with you
on one condition.

01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:00.467
We give this place to Nathan,
our son-in-law.

01:08:00.511 --> 01:08:02.687
- Don't call him our son-in-law.

01:08:02.730 --> 01:08:04.254
No.

01:08:04.297 --> 01:08:05.994
- That's my condition.

01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:10.347
- Maybelline, this place
is worth something to us.

01:08:10.956 --> 01:08:13.263
Thousands in stuff
we can sell off.

01:08:13.306 --> 01:08:15.003
This is significant.

01:08:16.962 --> 01:08:18.484
- It's not ours, Jeb.

01:08:19.573 --> 01:08:22.576
Rickey wouldn't want us
to have this place.

01:08:24.535 --> 01:08:26.232
You don't deserve this place.

01:08:27.189 --> 01:08:28.930
We don't deserve this place.

01:08:42.205 --> 01:08:44.946
- I have to get back to work
tomorrow.

01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:47.166
- I need more time here, Jeb.

01:08:47.688 --> 01:08:49.603
- You're pushin' it.

01:08:50.908 --> 01:08:52.953
- Sienna has to find daycare.

01:08:52.997 --> 01:08:55.305
The show needs a new director.

01:08:55.348 --> 01:08:57.872
- Don't piss on my leg
and tell me it's rainin'.

01:09:02.921 --> 01:09:04.662
What are you doing
with these people?

01:09:04.705 --> 01:09:07.099
I'll send your sister up
to help ya.

01:09:09.667 --> 01:09:11.625
Maybe she can talk some sense
into ya.

01:09:15.281 --> 01:09:19.285
- This is very kind of you
to go pick up my sister.

01:09:19.328 --> 01:09:22.941
- So, uh,
if Bevette doesn't see me,
what does she look like?

01:09:22.984 --> 01:09:26.596
- Just look for the woman
with the pained expression
on her face,

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:28.990
as if life isn't worth living.

01:09:29.033 --> 01:09:30.644
- That's her?
- No.

01:09:30.688 --> 01:09:33.778
That'll be the woman who sat
next to her on the plane.

01:09:33.821 --> 01:09:35.562
She can point her out to you.

01:09:49.228 --> 01:09:51.055

is still carryin' on

01:10:06.898 --> 01:10:08.856
and him not even divorced yet.

01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:11.294
- Imogene. Who'd a-thought it.

01:10:11.337 --> 01:10:13.121
Butter wouldn't melt.

01:10:13.165 --> 01:10:16.951
- Tried to buy his kid's love

Harry Potter books.

01:10:16.995 --> 01:10:18.431
Didn't work.

01:10:18.475 --> 01:10:20.564
They'd already seen the movies.

01:10:20.607 --> 01:10:24.394
- My friend Cherry Poppins
has a joke in her act
where she bends over and says,

"Oops, I hope
you didn't see my hairy potter."

01:10:31.836 --> 01:10:33.881

The girls are makin' money.

01:11:21.929 --> 01:11:24.671
I swear
I even saw Nathan smile once.

01:11:25.498 --> 01:11:28.066
- Word is,
you put on a good drag show.

01:11:28.109 --> 01:11:30.677
- Not me.
The girls put on the drag show.

01:11:30.721 --> 01:11:33.071
I just taught 'em
three-part harmony.

01:11:33.114 --> 01:11:35.639
- Please. Those three
couldn't stuff a bra with socks.

01:11:35.682 --> 01:11:38.337
- Actually,
I've seen them do that.

01:11:38.381 --> 01:11:43.734
- Oh. Well, then I suppose
it's good that I walked away
and allowed them to blossom.

01:11:45.518 --> 01:11:47.955
- They need their mother back,
Dusty.

01:11:47.999 --> 01:11:49.435
- But they have you.

01:11:52.090 --> 01:11:54.571
- I could never take your place.
- Hmm.

01:11:55.354 --> 01:11:57.661
- All they ever talk about
is you.

01:11:58.531 --> 01:12:00.707
"Oh, these curtains
are so dusty.

01:12:00.751 --> 01:12:03.362
Oh, these glasses are so dusty."

01:12:05.756 --> 01:12:08.019
They miss their stage mother.

01:12:08.976 --> 01:12:12.371
I'm going back to Texas,
to church, to Jeb.

01:12:13.633 --> 01:12:15.374
That's my world.

01:12:16.767 --> 01:12:18.595
Come back to yours.

01:12:23.382 --> 01:12:26.733
- You sure about this?
- Maybelline, shake a leg.

01:12:26.777 --> 01:12:30.171
I don't want to be drivin'
through the Tenderloin
in the dark.

01:12:31.738 --> 01:12:34.393
- I'm... sorry about her.

01:12:34.437 --> 01:12:38.397
- Every family has a relative
who stabbed grandma
with a butter knife.

01:12:38.441 --> 01:12:40.921
- Or dynamited
a perfectly good barn.

01:12:57.111 --> 01:12:59.984
- There he is. Nanny.

01:13:00.027 --> 01:13:01.377
Look.

01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:03.074
- Baby Rickey!

01:13:05.424 --> 01:13:07.078
- Yeah, so light.

01:13:08.427 --> 01:13:10.211
Hi, Dusty.

01:13:10.255 --> 01:13:12.562
- Hey, you. It's Auntie Dusty.

01:13:12.605 --> 01:13:14.694
How are you?

01:13:14.738 --> 01:13:16.479
Yes, it's pretty over there.

01:13:17.436 --> 01:13:19.090
Take a look, it's magic.

01:13:22.615 --> 01:13:24.704
Oh...

01:13:24.748 --> 01:13:26.184
- Bye.

01:13:27.054 --> 01:13:29.448
- What are we gonna do
without our momma?

01:13:29.492 --> 01:13:31.537
- I'm going to miss y'all
so much.

01:13:31.581 --> 01:13:33.931
- You're gonna make
my mascara run.

01:13:33.974 --> 01:13:37.021
- Oh, stop.
- No one wants you to go,
Maybelline.

01:13:37.064 --> 01:13:38.718
- Well, this isn't my life.

01:13:38.762 --> 01:13:41.155
It was Rickey's and yours.

01:13:41.199 --> 01:13:43.419
I think it's for the best.

01:13:46.204 --> 01:13:48.032
- A little going-away present.

01:13:48.075 --> 01:13:50.513
Rickey used to get me
to tape his performances

01:13:50.556 --> 01:13:53.341
so he could watch 'em back
and get better.

01:13:55.561 --> 01:13:57.737
Now you can see how he was.

01:13:57.781 --> 01:14:00.131
- Oh.
- Dramatic and beautiful.

01:14:00.174 --> 01:14:01.785
Messy.

01:14:01.828 --> 01:14:03.482
Just like you.

01:14:03.526 --> 01:14:06.311
- Oh. Oh, thank you so much.

01:14:06.354 --> 01:14:09.270
Ugh! Oh, my Lord!

01:14:09.314 --> 01:14:10.881
- What?!

01:14:10.924 --> 01:14:13.666
- I just saw the general
and two colonels!

01:14:13.710 --> 01:14:15.842
- For the first time apparently.

01:14:15.886 --> 01:14:18.497
- First time
in the ladies' room.

01:14:18.541 --> 01:14:20.934
- Cherry, this is my sister,
Bevette.

01:14:22.501 --> 01:14:25.461
- Right. I thought she was one
of the new drag queens.

01:14:25.504 --> 01:14:27.288
Bevette,

01:14:27.332 --> 01:14:30.291
this is my darling friend,
Cherry.

01:14:30.335 --> 01:14:33.469
- Oh, the one
with the hairy potter.

01:14:33.512 --> 01:14:35.209
Well, it ain't that hairy.

01:14:37.516 --> 01:14:40.214
- Bevette, why don't you wait
outside in the lobby?

01:14:40.258 --> 01:14:41.738
I'll just be a minute.

01:14:44.349 --> 01:14:48.266
Nathan, I've got...
a going-away present for you,
too.

01:14:49.702 --> 01:14:51.661
This is all yours now.

01:14:52.923 --> 01:14:55.229

I know how much you miss him.

01:19:31.984 --> 01:19:33.812
Miss him myself for 20 years.

01:19:33.856 --> 01:19:35.509
- That was your choice.

01:19:35.553 --> 01:19:38.164
He was always the same,
even when he was a little boy.

01:19:38.208 --> 01:19:39.818

to be a family, Jeb.

It takes guts.

01:19:51.047 --> 01:19:53.919
You're still ashamed
of your own son.

01:19:53.963 --> 01:19:55.399
Even now.

01:19:55.442 --> 01:19:57.053
- He was a mama's boy,

01:19:57.096 --> 01:19:59.664
hidin' behind your skirts,
and you let him.

01:20:00.839 --> 01:20:03.886
- You didn't have the guts
to love your own son,

01:20:03.929 --> 01:20:06.802
'cause you were afraid
what other people would think.

01:20:06.845 --> 01:20:09.108
Well, let me tell you something,
Jeb.

01:20:09.152 --> 01:20:12.329
You can't make chicken salad
outta chicken shit!

01:20:14.679 --> 01:20:16.463
- I never understood him.

01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:18.944
You loved him enough
for both of us.

01:20:20.119 --> 01:20:22.774
Turned out just like you.

01:20:24.863 --> 01:20:26.343

01:20:27.692 --> 01:20:29.215
I was afraid too, Jeb.

01:20:31.957 --> 01:20:34.438
Of you, him, everyone.

01:20:34.481 --> 01:20:35.787
God.

01:20:35.831 --> 01:20:38.442
But I'm not afraid anymore.

01:20:38.485 --> 01:20:42.489
I'm not looking at our son
through your frightened eyes.

01:20:43.882 --> 01:20:47.190
Our boy... was a star.

01:20:49.714 --> 01:20:51.411
That's what he got from me.

01:21:16.741 --> 01:21:20.571
- Aw, hell, Maybelline,
you were a lot happier up there.
Even I could see that.

01:21:21.659 --> 01:21:23.182
Here.

01:21:23.226 --> 01:21:25.619

01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:41.505
Hi.

01:21:43.333 --> 01:21:45.030

01:21:45.074 --> 01:21:46.814
Hi.

01:21:46.858 --> 01:21:48.381
What are you doing here?

01:21:49.252 --> 01:21:52.646
- This is the only record store
in the neighbourhood,

01:21:52.690 --> 01:21:54.561
and it's a Saturday, so...

01:21:57.956 --> 01:22:02.047
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
everything about myself.

01:22:07.574 --> 01:22:09.750
- So... how are you?

01:22:09.794 --> 01:22:11.361
You look great.

01:22:12.144 --> 01:22:13.972
- Thanks. I'm good.

01:22:15.017 --> 01:22:17.323
I'm back in town,

01:22:17.367 --> 01:22:21.719
but everything's up in the air
for me right now.

01:22:23.590 --> 01:22:24.983
- Well...

01:22:25.027 --> 01:22:27.159
I'm not afraid of heights.

01:22:29.770 --> 01:22:31.772
So...

01:22:31.816 --> 01:22:33.818
what are you doing tonight?

01:22:33.861 --> 01:22:35.776
- Funny you should ask.

01:22:39.998 --> 01:22:42.000
- Okay. Okay, alright.

01:22:42.044 --> 01:22:44.568
Settle down, queens!

01:22:45.308 --> 01:22:46.962
- You look gorgeous tonight,
girl.

01:22:47.005 --> 01:22:50.530
D'you get all dressed up for us,
or is this for a man?

01:22:50.574 --> 01:22:53.359
- These days all my men
are wearing diapers and dresses.

01:22:53.403 --> 01:22:55.971
And that's all I need.

01:22:56.014 --> 01:22:58.147
Alright, bitches, get dressed.

01:22:59.191 --> 01:23:01.672

01:23:03.195 --> 01:23:05.763
You are a genius.
[laughing]

01:23:07.330 --> 01:23:09.593
- You ready, honey?

01:23:09.636 --> 01:23:11.551
I don't know.

01:23:14.206 --> 01:23:15.991
Oh.

01:23:16.034 --> 01:23:17.731
- One ain't gonna kill ya.

01:23:29.874 --> 01:23:34.009
- Tonight,
making her Pandora's Box debut

01:23:34.052 --> 01:23:35.836
is my partner.

01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:38.404
I call her Mom.

01:23:38.448 --> 01:23:40.450
- She's someone with a real name

01:23:40.493 --> 01:23:42.930
that a drag queen
would kill for.
