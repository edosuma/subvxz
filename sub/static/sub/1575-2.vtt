Now you've got to get them
to take them off.

19:24.031 --> 19:25.897
The jeans have
all the power.

19:25.899 --> 19:28.033
Because<i>you</i>
gave it to them!

19:28.035 --> 19:29.234
Now take it back.

Women of Langley,
I used to think jeans

19:32.639 --> 19:34.639
were the most important thing
in the world,

19:34.641 --> 19:37.442
that they made me worthy,
beautiful, lovable.

19:37.444 --> 19:43.314
Am I still now all these things
even without the jeans?

19:43.316 --> 19:46.918
Sure, but you're still
wearing them a little bit.

[ Grunting ]

19:49.523 --> 19:51.456
I should have taken
my shoes off first.

19:51.458 --> 19:55.727
I didn't realize it,
but I gave my power away

19:55.729 --> 19:59.531
to the jeans, something that
we are women should never do,

19:59.533 --> 20:02.333
because when we give jeans
too much power,

20:02.335 --> 20:04.069
they end up
controlling us.

20:04.071 --> 20:06.738
Really go for it, Francine.
You can't hurt me.

20:06.740 --> 20:08.473
Aaaah,
it hurts so much!

20:08.475 --> 20:09.875
You're breaking my feet!

20:11.144 --> 20:13.278
Find a supportive friend,

20:13.280 --> 20:16.815
and get out
of those damn jeans.

20:16.817 --> 20:18.017
They're doing it!

They're free
of the jeans!

It's just like the dream,
how it all started.

20:32.499 --> 20:35.967
Jeans, do you have
a message for us?

20:35.969 --> 20:39.438
Jeans:
Confidence is sexy.

That giant talking pair
of jeans is worth millions!

Get it, boys!

20:51.985 --> 20:53.585
Sorry, jeans.
