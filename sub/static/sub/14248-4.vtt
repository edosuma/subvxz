WEBVTT

00:03.003 --> 00:07.337
Captain's Log, Stardate 48532.4.

00:07.407 --> 00:09.398
We're on our way
to a rogue planetoid

00:09.476 --> 00:10.704
which Mr. Neelix tells us

00:10.777 --> 00:13.439
is an extremely rich source
of raw dilithium.

00:13.513 --> 00:15.640
lf he's right,
this could go a long way

00:15.715 --> 00:18.513
toward easing
our power shortage.

00:18.585 --> 00:21.645
Assuming we do find dilithium
on this planetoid,

00:21.721 --> 00:23.313
we're going to need
a refining facility

00:23.390 --> 00:24.880
on the ship to process it.

00:24.958 --> 00:26.653
Lieutenant Torres
has already asked permission

00:26.726 --> 00:27.818
to start modifications

00:27.894 --> 00:30.362
to the auxiliary
impulse reactor.

00:30.430 --> 00:34.161
lt could be converted into
a crude dilithium refinery.

00:34.234 --> 00:36.327
The impulse reactor?

00:36.403 --> 00:38.462
Sometimes l think B'Elanna
goes out of her way

00:38.538 --> 00:41.268
to find solutions that ignore
Starfleet procedures.

00:41.341 --> 00:42.740
Her arguments
are quite convincing.

00:42.809 --> 00:44.401
She thinks
it can be done safely.

00:44.477 --> 00:45.535
l'm sure it can.

00:45.612 --> 00:48.046
Tell her l want regular
reports on her progress

00:48.114 --> 00:50.048
every step of the way.

00:50.116 --> 00:51.981
Are you sure you won't
join me for breakfast?

00:52.052 --> 00:56.011
l was thinking of having
eggs Benedict with asparagus,

00:56.089 --> 00:58.751
strawberries and cream...

00:59.959 --> 01:02.826
l said l was thinking about it.

01:02.896 --> 01:05.592
l'm actually having
ration pack #5--

01:05.665 --> 01:07.895
stewed tomatoes
with dehydrated eggs.

01:07.967 --> 01:09.901
Mmm, sounds delicious,
but l've already had

01:09.969 --> 01:11.869
my vacuum-packed oatmeal
this morning.

01:11.938 --> 01:13.269
l'll see you on the Bridge.

01:15.000 --> 01:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:27.320 --> 01:28.651
Here you are.

01:28.721 --> 01:29.915
Hope you enjoy it.

01:29.989 --> 01:31.183
What is going on here?

01:31.257 --> 01:32.815
Captain, you caught
me by surprise.

01:32.892 --> 01:33.984
l could say the same thing.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.493
What are you doing?

01:35.562 --> 01:38.759
l know how you and the
other, uh, senior officers

01:38.832 --> 01:39.924
have been-- excuse me--

01:39.999 --> 01:41.626
disappointed
with the rations lately,

01:41.701 --> 01:44.192
so l thought l'd use
a few of the vegetables

01:44.270 --> 01:46.932
from the hydroponics
bay and whip up a...

01:47.006 --> 01:48.337
ooh, a little breakfast.

01:48.408 --> 01:50.842
You have turned this
into a Galley?

01:50.910 --> 01:52.138
lt wasn't easy.

01:52.212 --> 01:55.045
l had to completely reroute
the Mess Hall power conduits

01:55.115 --> 01:57.811
and scrounge a lot of supplies
from all over the ship,

01:57.884 --> 02:01.547
but that's my specialty--
making something out of nothing.

02:01.621 --> 02:02.918
l know it doesn't
look like much now,

02:02.989 --> 02:04.456
but in a few days, you'll swear

02:04.524 --> 02:06.287
there'd been a Galley here
for years.

02:06.359 --> 02:08.020
Careful.
That one is a little spicy.

02:08.094 --> 02:10.324
Neelix... who approved this?

02:10.395 --> 02:12.956
Uh, well... no one.

02:16.736 --> 02:18.829
Well, you might have
asked me first.

02:18.905 --> 02:21.669
This used to be
my private dining room.

02:21.741 --> 02:23.538
Your, your dining room?

02:23.610 --> 02:25.043
lf you had checked
the ship's directory,

02:25.111 --> 02:28.080
you'd have noticed
that Cabin 125-Alpha, Deck 2,

02:28.148 --> 02:30.639
is designated as the Captain's
Private Dining Room.

02:30.717 --> 02:35.620
Oh... oh, ah, then l guess
that you'll be wanting me

02:35.688 --> 02:37.883
to move all of this stuff
out of your way?

02:37.957 --> 02:39.117
Bridge to Captain Janeway.

02:39.192 --> 02:40.250
Go ahead.

02:40.326 --> 02:41.884
We're approaching
the rogue planetoid, Captain.

02:41.961 --> 02:43.155
On my way.

02:43.229 --> 02:44.423
l want you to come with me.

02:44.497 --> 02:46.829
We will deal with this later.

02:46.900 --> 02:49.300
Ensign Parsons, would you mind

02:49.369 --> 02:51.098
keeping an eye on things
until l get back...

02:51.171 --> 02:54.629
and, uh, rotate the darvot
fritters every ten minutes

02:54.707 --> 02:56.368
until they turn
a deep chartreuse.

02:56.442 --> 02:57.909
And remember-- one,
one to a customer.

03:01.948 --> 03:03.210
What have you found?

03:03.283 --> 03:05.114
We're picking up definite
dilithium signatures, Captain.

03:05.185 --> 03:08.882
The strongest readings
are originating from ten to 20

03:08.955 --> 03:10.923
kilometers inside the planetoid.

03:11.024 --> 03:13.117
lt also looks like there's
a series of subterranean caves

03:13.193 --> 03:15.718
with an oxygen-nitrogen
atmosphere.

03:15.795 --> 03:17.922
Class-M.
lt'll make mining a lot easier

03:17.997 --> 03:19.794
if we can go in there
without environmental suits.

03:19.866 --> 03:22.357
How much dilithium
are we talking about?

03:22.435 --> 03:24.562
lt's hard to get
a precise reading.

03:24.637 --> 03:28.596
lt could be anywhere from 500
to... 1,000 metric tons.

03:28.675 --> 03:30.404
Just as l said.

03:30.476 --> 03:32.967
l bet there are
few Yallitian engineers

03:33.046 --> 03:34.911
who'd give all three
of their spinal columns

03:34.981 --> 03:37.211
to know where this planet is.

03:37.283 --> 03:40.377
Commander, take an away team
down into those caves and do

03:40.453 --> 03:41.818
a preliminary
geological analysis.

03:41.888 --> 03:42.980
Lieutenant, you'd better get

03:43.056 --> 03:45.251
your dilithium refinery on line.

03:45.325 --> 03:46.986
lt'll be ready to go
in three days.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.652
Ensign Kim.

03:53.032 --> 03:54.124
Where are you going?

03:54.200 --> 03:55.189
With you.

03:55.268 --> 03:58.499
l've been studying
my Tricorder Operations Manual.

03:58.571 --> 04:00.129
Lieutenant Torres
has brought me up-to-date

04:00.206 --> 04:01.673
on dilithium geophysics.

04:01.741 --> 04:05.643
l've been preparing
for this mission all week.

04:07.914 --> 04:10.348
Very well, Mr. Neelix.

04:10.416 --> 04:14.147
l think you'll find me
extremely helpful, Commander.

04:14.220 --> 04:16.745
l remember the first time
that l flew past this planet.

04:16.822 --> 04:17.915
lt was about three years ago...

04:17.991 --> 04:19.048
Deck 4.

04:21.861 --> 04:23.886
Looks like there are several
large deposits

04:23.963 --> 04:25.123
in this general vicinity.

04:25.198 --> 04:28.497
Let's split up and begin
taking geological scans.

04:28.568 --> 04:30.968
Keep your com channels
open at all times

04:31.037 --> 04:32.834
and don't wander too far.

04:32.905 --> 04:35.533
Stay within a 50-meter
radius of this position.

06:46.339 --> 06:47.306
Chakotay to Kim.

06:47.373 --> 06:48.305
Go ahead.

06:48.374 --> 06:50.706
l'm still picking up
dilithium signatures...

06:50.777 --> 06:55.146
but there are no
dilithium formations here.

06:55.214 --> 06:57.273
Have you found anything yet?

06:57.350 --> 06:58.544
l'm running
a geo-stratal analysis

06:58.618 --> 06:59.710
of the rock in this vicinity.

06:59.786 --> 07:02.516
But so far, there's no
indication of any dilithium.

07:02.622 --> 07:04.556
Keep looking.

07:04.590 --> 07:06.751
Neelix to Commander Chakotay.

07:06.826 --> 07:07.850
Go ahead.

07:10.897 --> 07:12.728
l think l found something--

07:12.799 --> 07:19.671
a large cavern approximately
20 meters from my position.

07:19.739 --> 07:23.505
l'm reading a huge
dilithium formation there.

07:23.576 --> 07:24.873
Don't go any further, Neelix.

07:25.044 --> 07:27.569
Stay within the search radius.

07:27.647 --> 07:29.239
l'll be with you in a minute.

07:29.315 --> 07:30.782
But it's right here!

07:33.453 --> 07:36.616
l'm in the cavern now,
Commander, but...

07:37.957 --> 07:39.822
l don't understand this.

07:39.892 --> 07:42.417
Let me guess-- nothing there?

07:42.495 --> 07:45.828
Not so much as a sliver
of dilithium.

07:45.898 --> 07:47.695
And yet, according
to my readings,

07:47.767 --> 07:49.462
l should be surrounded by it.

07:49.535 --> 07:50.763
All right, l've had enough
of this.

07:50.837 --> 07:54.034
Kim, Neelix,
we're heading back to the ship.

07:54.106 --> 07:55.130
Rendezvous with the...

07:55.208 --> 07:56.334
Wait a minute.

07:56.409 --> 08:00.368
l'm getting unusual readings
from this rock face.

08:00.446 --> 08:03.313
Traces of organic energy.

08:03.382 --> 08:07.443
Looks like
a bioelectrical signature.

08:09.055 --> 08:12.320
l think there's something alive
down here.

08:14.093 --> 08:18.860
lt's about... two meters
into this rock face.

08:18.931 --> 08:21.058
Neelix, l said get back here.

08:26.906 --> 08:29.204
Neelix, did you hear
what l said?

08:29.275 --> 08:31.709
Just one minute, Commander.

08:41.787 --> 08:42.754
Hello?

08:42.822 --> 08:46.223
ls there someone there?

08:46.292 --> 08:48.123
Hello?

08:50.563 --> 08:52.030
l know there's somebody...

08:56.235 --> 08:57.862
Neelix, what's wrong?

08:59.305 --> 09:01.796
Neelix!

09:01.874 --> 09:02.932
Kim!

09:03.009 --> 09:04.806
l'm on my way, sir.

09:07.313 --> 09:09.747
l can't be sure, but l think
he's going into shock.

09:09.815 --> 09:12.375
Chakotay to Voyager--
medical emergency.

09:12.451 --> 09:14.282
Beam us directly to Sick Bay.

09:25.498 --> 09:27.159
Get the blood-gas infuser.

09:27.233 --> 09:28.393
The what?

09:28.467 --> 09:31.459
Equipment Storage Unit 2,
second shelf on the left, now.

09:31.537 --> 09:33.528
Hold him still.

09:36.375 --> 09:37.603
What's happening, Doctor?

09:37.677 --> 09:39.406
He's going into a coma.

09:41.213 --> 09:43.579
The infuser will keep
his oxygen level stable

09:43.649 --> 09:46.379
for the next hour or so,
but after that, he'll die.

09:46.452 --> 09:48.545
His lungs have been removed.

09:53.993 --> 09:56.257
By the time we got to him,
he was unconscious.

09:56.329 --> 09:58.729
How could anyone remove
his organs so quickly?

09:58.798 --> 09:59.924
The doctor says
whoever did this

10:00.032 --> 10:01.158
used some kind of transporter

10:01.233 --> 10:03.724
to beam the lungs
directly out of his body.

10:03.803 --> 10:05.236
What happened?

10:05.304 --> 10:08.068
lt appears that Neelix
was attacked.

10:08.140 --> 10:09.232
We don't know how it happened,

10:09.308 --> 10:13.176
but someone has surgically
removed his lungs.

10:15.081 --> 10:16.275
Did you find any evidence

10:16.349 --> 10:17.611
of the life sign
that Neelix reported?

10:17.683 --> 10:18.615
No.

10:18.684 --> 10:20.413
Captain, l've analyzed
the sensor logs

10:20.486 --> 10:21.612
from Neelix's tricorder.

10:21.687 --> 10:22.779
The bio-scanner picked up

10:22.855 --> 10:25.085
a single class-3
humanoid organism.

10:25.157 --> 10:26.215
The blood-gas infuser

10:26.292 --> 10:28.556
will keep him alive
for another 47 minutes.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.290
The only chance for his survival
l see at the moment

10:31.364 --> 10:32.854
is to get his own lungs back.

10:32.932 --> 10:35.492
Can't we fit him with
a pair of artificial lungs?

10:35.568 --> 10:37.297
His respiratory system
is directly linked

10:37.370 --> 10:39.531
to multiple points
along his spinal column.

10:39.605 --> 10:41.095
lt's too complex to replicate.

10:41.173 --> 10:43.198
l may be able to surgically
reattach the organs

10:43.275 --> 10:44.606
if we get them back.

10:44.677 --> 10:47.373
ln the meantime, l'll have
to search for other options.

10:47.446 --> 10:51.314
Commander, l'm taking an away
team back to the planet.

10:51.384 --> 10:53.249
You're in charge
until we return.

10:53.319 --> 10:54.581
lnform Mr. Tuvok

10:54.654 --> 10:56.918
l want three armed security
detachments to accompany us.

10:56.989 --> 10:58.354
lssue type-3 phasers.

10:58.424 --> 10:59.618
Mr. Paris,

10:59.692 --> 11:01.353
did they teach you how to
run a respiratory series

11:01.460 --> 11:04.190
in your biochemistry
classes at the Academy?

11:04.230 --> 11:06.130
No, l'm afraid they didn't.

11:06.198 --> 11:09.224
Fine. l'll run it myself.

11:09.301 --> 11:11.269
Get me a pulmonary scanner.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.396
l'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

11:13.472 --> 11:14.632
l'm not leaving.

11:14.707 --> 11:17.175
All right, just keep
out of the way.

11:21.147 --> 11:22.114
Here it is.

11:22.181 --> 11:23.478
This is where Neelix
was standing

11:23.549 --> 11:24.481
when he was attacked.

11:24.550 --> 11:25.744
According to his tricorder log,

11:25.818 --> 11:28.309
he was scanning this rock face
when he detected the life sign.

11:28.387 --> 11:29.786
Neelix said there was
a life sign

11:29.855 --> 11:32.153
two meters behind this wall,

11:32.224 --> 11:35.819
but my tricorder says
there's nothing but solid rock

11:35.895 --> 11:37.988
for another 15 meters.

11:38.064 --> 11:39.224
lt sounds like our tricorders

11:39.298 --> 11:40.526
aren't giving us
the real picture

11:40.599 --> 11:41.623
behind what's going on here.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.225
Wait a minute.

11:43.302 --> 11:45.827
The rock is warmer here.

11:45.905 --> 11:46.872
You're right, Captain.

11:46.939 --> 11:47.997
There's a two-degree
differential

11:48.140 --> 11:49.198
in this section of the wall.

11:49.275 --> 11:51.243
There are no natural
geological phenomena

11:51.310 --> 11:53.107
that could be creating
this heat source.

11:54.113 --> 11:56.445
Let's make a little heat
of our own.

12:02.922 --> 12:05.857
There was a highly sophisticated
force field in place.

12:05.925 --> 12:08.223
There's a chamber
down this corridor.

12:17.002 --> 12:22.099
Doc, l think his cellular
toxicity level is rising.

12:23.409 --> 12:25.070
lt's up to 32 percent.

12:25.144 --> 12:26.839
Let's see if we can
stabilize those levels.

12:26.912 --> 12:28.345
Get me a cytoplasmic
stimulator.

12:29.648 --> 12:31.809
Ah, we don't have one.

12:31.884 --> 12:33.476
Then replicate one.

12:33.552 --> 12:34.712
Yeah.

12:39.291 --> 12:41.521
The design schematics are in
the ship's medical data base.

12:42.828 --> 12:43.920
Right.

12:43.996 --> 12:46.965
The man drives
a 700,000-ton starship

12:47.032 --> 12:49.091
so somebody thinks
he'd make a good medic.

12:49.168 --> 12:50.897
l can survive with
one lung, can't l?

12:50.970 --> 12:53.097
What if l donated
a lung to Neelix?

12:53.172 --> 12:54.730
A transplant is not an option.

12:54.807 --> 12:57.332
No one aboard is a compatible
match for a Talaxian.

12:57.409 --> 12:59.809
We're going to need
a completely new way

12:59.879 --> 13:01.506
to oxygenate his blood supply

13:01.614 --> 13:03.980
and relay
neuro-electrical impulses.

13:09.388 --> 13:11.788
Our replicators can't produce

13:11.857 --> 13:13.381
compatible artificial
organs for him,

13:13.459 --> 13:17.293
but maybe there's a way
to mimic their functions

13:17.363 --> 13:20.799
and give us direct control
of his respiratory system.

13:20.866 --> 13:23.699
Computer, is there
an identification matrix

13:23.769 --> 13:25.669
on Mr. Neelix from the last
time he used the transporter?

13:25.738 --> 13:26.670
Affirmative.

13:26.739 --> 13:28.104
Transfer it to console 4.

13:31.777 --> 13:32.937
What are you doing?

13:33.012 --> 13:34.479
l'm using the transporter matrix

13:34.547 --> 13:36.981
to get exact specifications
for Neelix's lungs.

13:37.049 --> 13:39.449
l thought you just said
we can't replicate his lungs.

13:39.518 --> 13:43.978
We can't, but if l can
reconfigure my emitter array,

13:44.056 --> 13:46.854
l might be able to create
a pair of holographic lungs

13:46.926 --> 13:48.086
for Mr. Neelix.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.651
Holographic lungs?

13:50.729 --> 13:51.661
lf it's successful,

13:51.730 --> 13:53.721
we can precisely control
his pulmonary functions

13:53.799 --> 13:55.130
to allow normal breathing.

13:58.437 --> 14:00.371
But a hologram is just
a projection of light

14:00.439 --> 14:02.134
held in a magnetic
containment field.

14:02.208 --> 14:03.698
There's no real matter involved.

14:04.710 --> 14:05.677
Now...

14:08.914 --> 14:10.677
you hit me.

14:14.253 --> 14:15.686
The magnetic containment field

14:15.754 --> 14:17.483
that creates the illusion
of my body

14:17.556 --> 14:20.320
can be modulated to allow
matter to pass through it

14:20.392 --> 14:24.123
or... be stopped.

14:24.196 --> 14:26.061
l might be able to modulate
the holographic lungs

14:26.131 --> 14:27.063
in the same way,

14:27.132 --> 14:28.656
allowing oxygen
and carbon dioxide

14:28.734 --> 14:30.702
to pass from the lungs
to the bloodstream.

14:30.769 --> 14:32.828
l want to know what this means.

14:32.905 --> 14:34.372
What are you going to do to him?

14:34.440 --> 14:35.372
There's no time to explain

14:35.441 --> 14:36.601
the exact procedure
to you right now.

14:36.675 --> 14:38.267
Oh, well, make the time,

14:38.344 --> 14:40.107
because l'm not going to let you

14:40.179 --> 14:42.511
perform any experimental
surgery on Neelix

14:42.581 --> 14:44.549
until l know exactly
what you're doing

14:44.617 --> 14:45.845
and what the risks are.

14:48.153 --> 14:50.519
The risk is that it won't work.

14:50.589 --> 14:52.113
And if it doesn't, he'll die.

14:52.191 --> 14:55.217
But it is his only
immediate chance for survival.

14:55.294 --> 14:56.420
lf he does survive,

14:56.495 --> 14:59.692
he'll have to be held motionless
in an isotropic restraint.

14:59.765 --> 15:01.255
The lungs need to be
perfectly aligned

15:01.367 --> 15:03.232
to his internal physiology.

15:03.269 --> 15:04.964
The computer won't
be able to compensate

15:05.037 --> 15:06.470
for any body movement
whatsoever.

15:06.538 --> 15:09.006
How long will he have
to stay like that?

15:09.074 --> 15:11.065
For the rest of his life,

15:11.143 --> 15:14.112
unless the holo-lungs can be
replaced by his original organs,

15:14.179 --> 15:15.908
and he will never be able
to leave

15:15.981 --> 15:18.176
the holographic environment
of this room.

15:18.250 --> 15:19.512
The holo-lungs would disappear

15:19.585 --> 15:20.950
the moment he went out the door.

15:27.860 --> 15:32.524
Kes, l know it sounds
pretty grim,

15:32.598 --> 15:35.294
but it's better than
losing him completely.

15:35.367 --> 15:38.336
This way, he'll still be alive.

15:38.404 --> 15:40.565
And maybe we can find
a better solution

15:40.639 --> 15:42.072
somewhere down the road.

15:47.246 --> 15:49.612
What do you think
Neelix would want?

15:49.682 --> 15:52.310
l'm not sure.

15:52.384 --> 15:56.616
But l do know
that l want him to live.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.458
This room is the source
of the dilithium signature

16:33.525 --> 16:34.890
we detected earlier.

16:34.960 --> 16:36.052
The power systems here

16:36.128 --> 16:39.029
are running on an unusual
dilithium matrix.

16:39.098 --> 16:40.531
So there are actually
no dilithium deposits

16:40.599 --> 16:41.691
on this planet?

16:41.767 --> 16:43.257
lt would appear not.

16:46.739 --> 16:48.639
Are these organs?

16:49.742 --> 16:52.472
This looks like some kind
of storage facility.

16:52.544 --> 16:54.478
l would say
you are correct, Captain.

16:54.546 --> 16:57.071
This appears to be
a biological repository.

16:57.149 --> 16:59.674
Any sign of Neelix's lungs?

16:59.752 --> 17:00.878
Negative.

17:00.986 --> 17:03.113
There is, however,
a Kazon liver,

17:03.155 --> 17:04.315
and although l cannot identify

17:04.390 --> 17:06.255
the other organs
on display here,

17:06.325 --> 17:07.791
l would say they bear
a striking similarity

17:07.859 --> 17:10.192
to pulmonary organs,
epidermal tissue,

17:10.262 --> 17:11.194
ocular nerve fiber...

17:11.262 --> 17:13.060
Save the cataloging
for later, Tuvok.

17:13.132 --> 17:14.359
According to my tricorder,

17:14.433 --> 17:16.492
there was a life form in this
room less than ten minutes ago.

17:16.568 --> 17:17.500
Captain.

17:17.569 --> 17:18.729
Open it.

17:23.041 --> 17:24.531
One life sign 20 meters ahead.

17:24.609 --> 17:25.598
Let's go.

17:58.343 --> 17:59.332
They've erected a force field

17:59.411 --> 18:01.276
with a rotating phase
modulation.

18:01.380 --> 18:02.870
We will not be able
to disrupt it.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.212
Voyager to Captain Janeway.

18:04.283 --> 18:05.215
Go ahead.

18:05.284 --> 18:06.216
We've just picked up

18:06.285 --> 18:08.515
an alien ship
leaving the planet.

18:08.587 --> 18:09.519
Tractor them, Commander.

18:09.588 --> 18:10.520
Sorry, Captain.

18:10.589 --> 18:11.647
They went into warp too quickly.

18:11.723 --> 18:12.747
Beam us back.

18:12.825 --> 18:15.259
As soon as we're aboard,
lay in a course for pursuit,

18:15.327 --> 18:16.487
maximum warp.

18:16.562 --> 18:17.927
Aye, Captain.

18:31.410 --> 18:33.378
Okay...

18:36.315 --> 18:39.375
the isotropic restraint
is activated.

18:39.451 --> 18:40.383
He won't be able to move

18:40.452 --> 18:41.919
more than two microns
in any direction.

18:42.020 --> 18:44.318
One micron would be preferable,

18:44.389 --> 18:45.822
but l suppose it'll have to do.

18:45.891 --> 18:47.654
lnitiating
the holographic emitter array.

18:51.063 --> 18:53.395
His cellular toxicity is rising.

18:53.465 --> 18:54.432
82 percent.

18:54.500 --> 18:56.593
86 percent.

18:56.668 --> 18:58.101
Computer, activate program
Neelix-1.

18:58.170 --> 18:59.535
Deactivate the infuser.

19:02.374 --> 19:04.171
lt's off-line.

19:04.243 --> 19:05.505
Here we go.

19:07.045 --> 19:08.842
90 percent.

19:08.947 --> 19:10.209
95 percent.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.056
Toxicity returning to normal.

19:24.229 --> 19:26.493
Captain's Log, supplemental.

19:26.565 --> 19:29.159
We are pursuing the alien ship
from the moon.

19:29.234 --> 19:31.065
They are not responding
to hails,

19:31.136 --> 19:33.161
and it appears
that our two ships

19:33.238 --> 19:35.069
are evenly matched for speed.

19:35.140 --> 19:36.869
Holographic lungs?

19:36.942 --> 19:38.375
Yes.

19:38.443 --> 19:41.640
And they're working perfectly,
if l do say so myself.

19:43.348 --> 19:46.374
Try to breathe normally.

19:46.552 --> 19:49.248
How long can l live like this?

19:49.321 --> 19:50.345
l don't know.

19:50.422 --> 19:52.913
This is an unprecedented
medical procedure.

19:53.025 --> 19:55.789
We will be closely monitoring
your condition.

19:55.861 --> 19:58.921
When do l get out
of this restraint?

19:58.997 --> 20:00.828
Unless Captain Janeway

20:00.899 --> 20:03.163
is successful in retrieving
your original lungs,

20:03.235 --> 20:04.327
you'll have to stay

20:04.403 --> 20:06.769
in the isotropic restraint
indefinitely.

20:08.407 --> 20:10.637
lndefinitely?

20:10.709 --> 20:13.200
You mean l...

20:13.278 --> 20:15.746
l could be in here
the rest of my life?

20:17.349 --> 20:18.907
Yes.

20:18.984 --> 20:20.645
But we're trying
to find the aliens

20:20.719 --> 20:22.311
that did this to you.

20:22.387 --> 20:24.446
The Captain is doing
everything she can.

20:26.024 --> 20:28.219
Well...

20:28.293 --> 20:31.558
if l'm going to be
in here a while,

20:31.630 --> 20:35.396
now's as good a time
as any to tell you.

20:35.467 --> 20:39.699
Your ceiling is hideous.

20:45.744 --> 20:47.541
l didn't design the room.

20:47.613 --> 20:48.910
l just work here.

20:48.981 --> 20:51.472
Something with a bit of color
would help.

20:51.550 --> 20:55.646
Maybe a nice tapestry
or a painting.

20:57.589 --> 20:59.955
Uh, could you dim the lights
a little?

21:00.025 --> 21:02.585
l'm a doctor, Mr. Neelix,
not a decorator.

21:02.694 --> 21:03.820
Perhaps you would be willing

21:03.862 --> 21:05.921
to accommodate his...

21:06.031 --> 21:07.692
aesthetic needs.

21:07.766 --> 21:09.825
And some music would be nice.

21:09.901 --> 21:13.132
Or better yet,
are you programmed to sing?

21:15.207 --> 21:16.265
Janeway to Paris.

21:16.341 --> 21:18.206
Please report to the Bridge.

21:18.277 --> 21:19.744
l'm on my way, Captain.

21:19.811 --> 21:22.507
You know where l am
if you need me.

21:22.581 --> 21:23.809
Thanks for everything.

21:25.784 --> 21:27.411
Oh, fine.

21:27.486 --> 21:29.920
l have a little accident,

21:29.988 --> 21:34.391
l lose a pair of lungs,
and the next thing l know

21:34.459 --> 21:38.793
Paris is swooping in
like a Rectilian vulture.

21:38.864 --> 21:41.458
What are you talking about?

21:41.533 --> 21:44.229
Didn't you hear the way
that he said that?

21:44.303 --> 21:48.239
''l'll be on the Bridge
if you need me.''

21:48.307 --> 21:51.708
''lf you need me.''

21:51.777 --> 21:52.744
Neelix...

21:52.811 --> 21:53.743
Why doesn't he just

21:53.812 --> 21:55.404
pull the plug
on the holographic emitter,

21:55.480 --> 21:57.175
and get it over with,
get me out of the way,

21:57.249 --> 21:58.580
so he can have you
all to himself?

21:58.650 --> 22:00.743
Neelix, you're overreacting.

22:00.819 --> 22:02.514
Tom's been very supportive.

22:02.587 --> 22:06.148
Ah, so it's ''Tom'' now, is it?

22:06.224 --> 22:08.351
You really have
nothing to worry about.

22:08.427 --> 22:09.894
We're friends, that's all.

22:09.961 --> 22:12.623
lt's not you l'm worried about.

22:12.698 --> 22:14.689
lt's him.

22:14.766 --> 22:16.165
He's just...

22:16.234 --> 22:20.933
one big hormone
walking around the ship.

22:21.073 --> 22:24.804
Don't you see the way
that he looks at you?

22:26.545 --> 22:27.876
This is ridiculous.

22:27.946 --> 22:31.507
l am not going to argue with you

22:31.583 --> 22:35.178
about something that exists
only in your imagination.

22:36.922 --> 22:39.254
l know you, Neelix.

22:39.324 --> 22:43.090
And l know you're afraid.

22:44.463 --> 22:47.990
l just want you to know
that no matter what happens,

22:48.066 --> 22:49.590
l'll be here with you.

22:49.668 --> 22:53.798
Ke... Kes...

22:53.872 --> 22:57.035
l could be in here
a very long time.

22:58.276 --> 23:00.938
You need to go on
with your life.

23:01.012 --> 23:02.377
Don't worry about me.

23:02.447 --> 23:03.880
Neelix...

23:03.949 --> 23:06.042
You should just let me die.

23:06.118 --> 23:07.585
Stop that.

23:07.652 --> 23:10.519
We're going
to get through this together.

23:10.589 --> 23:12.250
Visiting hours are over.

23:12.324 --> 23:14.758
He needs rest.

23:14.826 --> 23:16.657
When can l come back?

23:16.728 --> 23:20.425
1700 hours,
not a minute before.

23:20.499 --> 23:22.524
l'll see you then.

23:29.341 --> 23:31.775
Don't worry.
l'm not going to kiss you.

23:31.843 --> 23:33.777
l'm only adjusting
the restraint.

23:33.845 --> 23:36.871
l'll try to contain
my disappointment.

23:39.518 --> 23:41.748
Captain, we've completed
our diagnostic

23:41.820 --> 23:43.117
on the alien device.

23:43.188 --> 23:45.452
lt appears to be
more than a weapon.

23:45.524 --> 23:47.788
lt's also a very sophisticated
medical scanner

23:47.859 --> 23:49.588
and surgical instrument.

23:49.661 --> 23:50.821
From what we can tell,

23:50.896 --> 23:52.989
lt uses a neural resonator
to stun the victim

23:53.098 --> 23:54.588
while a quantum imaging scanner

23:54.666 --> 23:57.157
begins a microcellular
analysis of the entire body.

23:57.235 --> 23:58.793
The amount of information
this thing can gather

23:58.870 --> 24:00.633
puts a tricorder to shame.

24:00.739 --> 24:01.797
You fire this at someone,

24:01.840 --> 24:03.501
you learn everything
about their anatomy,

24:03.575 --> 24:05.907
right down
to their DNA sequencing.

24:05.977 --> 24:07.968
So it sounds like
we're dealing with aliens

24:08.046 --> 24:10.446
who've developed a technology
specifically designed

24:10.515 --> 24:14.349
to locate and extract organs
from other beings. Why?

24:14.419 --> 24:15.408
Captain.

24:18.457 --> 24:20.288
The alien ship
has dropped out of warp.

24:20.358 --> 24:22.792
lt's approaching
a large asteroid.

24:22.861 --> 24:24.158
On screen.

24:24.229 --> 24:26.697
lt's entered the asteroid,
Captain.

24:26.765 --> 24:27.697
Hold position here.

24:27.766 --> 24:28.698
Mr. Kim?

24:28.767 --> 24:29.859
l can't scan the interior.

24:29.935 --> 24:33.098
The surface stratum
is made up of some sort

24:33.171 --> 24:34.536
of neutronium alloy.

24:34.606 --> 24:36.904
lt doesn't look like
a natural formation.

24:36.975 --> 24:39.136
Are you saying someone
built this asteroid?

24:39.211 --> 24:40.143
lt's possible.

24:40.212 --> 24:41.577
Any sign of weapons
or defense systems?

24:41.646 --> 24:43.511
Negative.

24:43.582 --> 24:45.675
l think l've located
where the alien ship entered.

24:45.750 --> 24:48.514
There's an open crater
on the limb of the asteroid.

24:48.587 --> 24:49.713
Let's see it.

24:53.525 --> 24:56.585
The ion trail
from the alien ship

24:56.661 --> 24:57.992
leads directly inside.

24:58.063 --> 25:00.657
How large is that crater?

25:00.732 --> 25:03.462
200 meters in diameter.

25:03.535 --> 25:05.002
Captain,

25:05.070 --> 25:06.867
may l suggest
you consider carefully

25:06.972 --> 25:08.269
what you are about to do.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.331
How do you know
what l'm about to do?

25:10.408 --> 25:12.273
l could describe to you
in detail

25:12.344 --> 25:13.572
the psychological observations

25:13.645 --> 25:16.443
l've made about you
over the past four years,

25:16.515 --> 25:19.075
which lead me to conclude
you're about to take

25:19.150 --> 25:22.119
this ship inside the asteroid,
but suffice it to say

25:22.187 --> 25:24.212
l know you quite well.

25:24.289 --> 25:27.224
One of these days, l'm going
to surprise you, Tuvok,

25:27.292 --> 25:29.283
but not today.

25:29.361 --> 25:31.329
l've already considered
other options.

25:31.396 --> 25:33.489
lf Neelix has any chance
of surviving,

25:33.565 --> 25:35.931
we have to act fast.

25:36.034 --> 25:37.501
Red Alert.

25:37.569 --> 25:39.594
Mr. Paris, lay in a course.

25:39.671 --> 25:41.138
Aye, Captain.

25:41.206 --> 25:42.935
Mr. Tuvok, maximum shields.

25:43.074 --> 25:44.598
Phasers at the ready.

26:01.393 --> 26:05.625
Captain, l'm reducing power
to the aft thrusters only.

26:05.697 --> 26:08.257
This passageway is
getting a little

26:08.333 --> 26:10.062
too narrow for my taste.

26:10.135 --> 26:12.695
Use your discretion, Mr. Paris.

26:12.771 --> 26:14.602
Any sign of the vessel,
Lieutenant?

26:14.673 --> 26:16.470
We're still following
the ion trail,

26:16.541 --> 26:19.533
but electromagnetic interference
is limiting our sensor range.

26:19.611 --> 26:22.045
l'm only able to scan
500 meters ahead of us.

26:22.113 --> 26:24.308
Are there any indications

26:24.382 --> 26:26.077
we're being scanned or probed,
Mr. Kim?

26:26.151 --> 26:27.778
Not yet.

26:36.595 --> 26:37.994
Doctor?

26:40.465 --> 26:42.933
Doctor,
l require your assistance.

26:43.001 --> 26:44.764
What is it, Mr. Neelix?

26:44.836 --> 26:46.929
Please, it's urgent.

26:47.038 --> 26:48.528
Yes?

26:48.607 --> 26:50.700
l have an itch.

26:51.710 --> 26:53.439
An itch?

26:54.980 --> 26:57.073
Just above my left eyebrow.

27:01.519 --> 27:02.508
A little higher.

27:05.357 --> 27:06.847
Oh, thank you.

27:06.958 --> 27:08.357
You're quite welcome.

27:08.426 --> 27:10.485
Doctor, wait, don't leave.

27:10.562 --> 27:11.756
l'm not leaving, Mr. Neelix.

27:11.830 --> 27:13.092
l'm simply going
back to work.

27:13.164 --> 27:15.064
l can't see you over there.

27:16.768 --> 27:19.168
l... l feel like l'm all alone.

27:19.237 --> 27:20.534
You are all alone.

27:20.605 --> 27:22.266
l'm a holographic projection--

27:22.340 --> 27:25.275
a projection with a lot
of work to do, l might add.

27:27.712 --> 27:30.044
That's very amusing, Doctor.

27:30.115 --> 27:33.278
But... um...

27:33.351 --> 27:38.050
l'm really starting to feel
a little, uh... trapped in here.

27:38.123 --> 27:40.990
A little claustrophobic maybe.

27:42.694 --> 27:44.218
l'm not sure what to do.

27:44.295 --> 27:46.889
There's nothing you can do
except lie there and be quiet.

27:46.965 --> 27:49.229
l'm going to lie here

27:49.300 --> 27:53.236
for the rest of my life,
aren't l?

27:53.304 --> 27:56.467
Just staring up at the ceiling.

27:57.676 --> 28:00.577
l'm not sure l can take that.

28:00.645 --> 28:05.014
l really need to get out
of this restraint.

28:06.584 --> 28:08.950
Doctor, l want you to let me
out of this thing

28:09.020 --> 28:10.214
right now.

28:10.288 --> 28:12.518
You know that's impossible.

28:12.590 --> 28:14.023
l'm the patient.

28:14.092 --> 28:15.286
l know what my rights are.

28:15.360 --> 28:20.024
l want to be released
from this restraint immediately.

28:21.599 --> 28:24.227
lmmediately!

28:24.302 --> 28:28.796
Mr. Neelix, you are alive,
you are breathing

28:28.873 --> 28:30.568
and for the moment,
your condition is stable.

28:30.642 --> 28:33.202
That is more than most people
can say in your situation.

28:33.278 --> 28:35.542
Now, it is critical
to your recovery

28:35.613 --> 28:38.810
that you not subject yourself
to any additional stress.

28:38.883 --> 28:40.373
Try to calm down.

28:40.452 --> 28:42.181
Don't tell me to calm down!

28:42.253 --> 28:44.721
You're not the one trapped
in a restraining field with...

28:45.890 --> 28:47.585
...holo-lungs.

28:47.659 --> 28:49.752
l don't think they're working.

28:49.828 --> 28:53.787
l can't... l can't
get enough oxygen.

28:53.865 --> 28:56.561
There's something wrong.

28:56.634 --> 28:58.795
You're hyperventilating.

28:58.870 --> 29:01.464
Try to take slow,
natural breaths.

29:01.573 --> 29:03.541
l can't.

29:05.510 --> 29:06.738
l'm dying.

29:06.811 --> 29:08.142
Let me out of here.

29:09.180 --> 29:10.511
Will you help me?

29:10.582 --> 29:12.379
Help me.

29:12.450 --> 29:13.678
Help me!

29:33.304 --> 29:36.102
You're doing just fine,
Mr. Paris. Just fine.

29:36.174 --> 29:38.267
Thanks, Captain.

29:38.343 --> 29:41.176
Sensors detect
a large chamber ahead.

29:50.121 --> 29:52.248
What the hell?

29:52.323 --> 29:54.518
We appear to be seeing
Voyager and the alien ship

29:54.592 --> 29:56.253
reflecting off the walls
of the chamber.

29:56.327 --> 29:59.728
Can you determine which ship
is the real one?

29:59.798 --> 30:01.163
No, Captain.

30:01.232 --> 30:04.531
The walls are emanating severe
electromagnetic interference.

30:04.602 --> 30:06.092
l cannot scan them directly.

30:06.171 --> 30:08.639
lt's like trying to move
through a hall of mirrors.

30:08.706 --> 30:11.971
You never know when you're
going to walk into the glass.

30:12.076 --> 30:14.772
l'm still picking up
the alien's ion trail.

30:14.846 --> 30:16.313
Maybe we should follow that.

30:16.381 --> 30:19.544
They might have left a fake
ion trail to lure us in here.

30:19.617 --> 30:21.983
lt could lead us right
into one of those walls.

30:22.053 --> 30:23.850
That's a chance we're
going to have to take.

30:23.922 --> 30:27.756
Tuvok, extend the deflectors
to maximum range.

30:27.826 --> 30:29.088
lf we do run into something,

30:29.160 --> 30:30.923
it'll give us
an extra margin of error.

30:30.995 --> 30:33.623
Follow the ion trail,
Mr. Paris, slowly.

30:33.698 --> 30:35.859
Mr. Kim, continuous scans.

30:35.934 --> 30:37.834
Aye, Captain.

30:45.143 --> 30:48.112
l'll do what l can
to reassure him, Doctor.

30:48.179 --> 30:49.908
Good. lf you don't mind,

30:49.981 --> 30:51.141
l'd like you
to remain in Sick Bay,

30:51.216 --> 30:53.309
so you're here when he wakes up.

30:53.384 --> 30:54.942
Of course.

30:56.254 --> 30:57.312
Are you all right?

30:57.388 --> 30:58.377
Me?

30:58.456 --> 31:00.617
You seem agitated
about something.

31:00.725 --> 31:01.749
Of course l'm agitated.

31:01.793 --> 31:03.920
This entire situation
is getting out of control.

31:04.028 --> 31:05.325
You mean Neelix.

31:08.867 --> 31:11.097
First they tell me
there's no doctor,

31:11.169 --> 31:13.296
so l have to be
on call 24 hours a day.

31:13.371 --> 31:15.396
And then they tell me
there are no nurses,

31:15.473 --> 31:16.940
so l have no one to assist me.

31:17.041 --> 31:19.566
l thought Tom Paris
was assigned to you.

31:19.644 --> 31:23.580
Like l said, no one
to assist me,

31:23.648 --> 31:27.744
and now l have a patient with
severe and possibly long-term

31:27.819 --> 31:30.515
emotional problems and there's
no Counselor on board.

31:32.223 --> 31:35.351
l am an emergency medical
supplement--

31:35.426 --> 31:37.485
a supplement, that's all.

31:37.662 --> 31:39.186
l wasn't programmed
for any of this.

31:39.264 --> 31:40.993
lt's just...

31:41.065 --> 31:43.499
unacceptable.

31:43.568 --> 31:46.696
l don't know anything about
holographic engineering,

31:46.771 --> 31:49.934
but if you want my opinion,
you haven't been acceptable.

31:50.008 --> 31:52.306
You've been remarkable.

31:52.377 --> 31:56.473
l've only done what
the program allows me to.

31:56.547 --> 31:58.708
Give yourself some credit.

31:58.783 --> 32:01.946
You saved his life.

32:02.053 --> 32:05.079
You did-- not some program.

32:05.123 --> 32:08.422
lt may seem that way to you.

32:08.493 --> 32:10.484
That's exactly how it seems.

32:12.764 --> 32:14.823
You're very...

32:14.899 --> 32:16.560
kind.

32:16.634 --> 32:17.931
How does a real doctor learn

32:18.002 --> 32:20.470
to deal with patients'
emotional problems, anyway?

32:20.538 --> 32:22.870
They learn from experience.

32:22.941 --> 32:25.034
Aren't you capable of learning?

32:25.109 --> 32:27.634
l have the capacity
to accumulate

32:27.712 --> 32:29.202
and process data, yes.

32:29.280 --> 32:33.341
Then l guess
you'll just have to learn...

32:33.418 --> 32:35.682
like the rest of us.

32:38.256 --> 32:40.724
Have you ever considered
a career in medicine?

32:42.727 --> 32:44.752
Neelix is starting
to regain consciousness.

32:47.865 --> 32:49.264
Lieutenant, l'm picking up

32:49.334 --> 32:51.768
a minor power fluctuation
in the warp core.

32:51.836 --> 32:53.997
Compensate
with the KLS stabilizer.

32:54.072 --> 32:55.972
No effect.

32:56.040 --> 32:57.974
ln fact, the power loss
is starting to accelerate.

32:58.042 --> 33:00.374
Janeway to Torres.
What's going on down there?

33:00.445 --> 33:03.073
Some kind of power drain.

33:04.983 --> 33:07.474
l can't localize it, but...

33:07.552 --> 33:08.610
we're losing power

33:08.686 --> 33:10.313
at a rate of seven percent
per minute.

33:10.388 --> 33:12.856
The power drain is coming

33:12.924 --> 33:14.687
from somewhere in this chamber,
Captain.

33:14.759 --> 33:17.319
Some kind of dampening field.

33:17.395 --> 33:20.193
lt's bleeding energy directly
from the warp nacelles.

33:20.264 --> 33:22.061
B'Elanna,
shut down the warp core.

33:22.133 --> 33:24.124
Go to emergency power.

33:24.202 --> 33:26.067
No effect, Captain.

33:26.137 --> 33:27.570
Keep me informed.

33:27.638 --> 33:28.662
Bridge out.

33:28.740 --> 33:30.867
Can you pinpoint the source
of the dampening field?

33:30.942 --> 33:35.072
lt appears to be coming
from 217 mark 015.

33:35.146 --> 33:37.080
Distance 547 meters.

33:37.148 --> 33:38.513
Tuvok.

33:38.583 --> 33:39.515
What would happen

33:39.584 --> 33:41.484
if we locked phasers
and fired at the source?

33:41.552 --> 33:44.385
The walls of this chamber
reflect directed energy.

33:44.455 --> 33:47.219
The phaser beam would ricochet
along an unpredictable path,

33:47.291 --> 33:49.486
possibly impacting
our ship in the process.

33:49.560 --> 33:52.222
All right.
We won't try that.

33:52.296 --> 33:53.558
Well, maybe we should.

33:53.631 --> 33:55.565
Tuvok, what would happen

33:55.633 --> 33:58.727
if we reduced the phaser
power level to a minimum setting

33:58.803 --> 34:00.600
and sent out
a continuous beam?

34:00.705 --> 34:03.674
The phaser would continue
to reflect off the bulkheads

34:03.708 --> 34:06.176
until it encountered
a nonreflective material.

34:06.244 --> 34:08.768
Until it encountered
a nonreflective material--

34:08.846 --> 34:10.473
like the real alien ship.

34:10.547 --> 34:13.176
So we could use the phasers
like a searchlight...

34:13.251 --> 34:15.514
scan the interior of the station
until we find the ship.

34:15.585 --> 34:17.053
Exactly.

34:17.121 --> 34:18.418
Do it.

34:27.098 --> 34:29.089
Adjusting phaser azimuth
to 15 degrees.

34:29.167 --> 34:30.293
Wait a minute.

34:30.368 --> 34:31.630
l think l've found
the real ship.

34:31.702 --> 34:33.498
On screen.

34:36.873 --> 34:39.809
Mr. Paris, bring us within
transporter range of that ship.

34:39.877 --> 34:40.809
Aye, Captain.

34:40.878 --> 34:42.708
l'm picking up two life signs.

34:42.780 --> 34:44.077
They're powering engines.

34:44.148 --> 34:45.547
Bridge to Transporter Room 3.

34:45.616 --> 34:47.982
Lock on to those two life signs
and beam them aboard.

34:48.085 --> 34:49.678
Security, meet me
in Transporter Room 3.

34:49.754 --> 34:51.516
Aye, sir.

35:13.845 --> 35:16.313
You're on the Starship Voyager.

35:16.380 --> 35:18.211
l'm Captain Kathryn Janeway

35:18.282 --> 35:20.750
of the United Federation
of Planets.

35:20.818 --> 35:23.013
l am Dereth...

35:23.087 --> 35:26.420
of the Vidiian Sodality.

35:26.491 --> 35:28.322
You attacked
one of our crew members

35:28.392 --> 35:31.555
and you lured us
into this asteroid. Why?

35:31.629 --> 35:32.857
We are gathering

35:32.930 --> 35:37.890
replacement organs
and suitable biomatter.

35:37.969 --> 35:42.429
lt is the only way we have
to fight the phage.

35:42.507 --> 35:43.769
A virus?

35:43.841 --> 35:45.832
Some kind of disease?

35:45.910 --> 35:46.934
Yes.

35:47.078 --> 35:50.980
lt attacked our people
over two millennia ago.

35:51.048 --> 35:53.744
lt consumes our bodies

35:53.818 --> 35:57.914
destroys our genetic codes
and cellular structures.

36:00.158 --> 36:02.854
So you harvest the bodies
of other beings

36:02.927 --> 36:05.225
to replace your own tissues

36:05.296 --> 36:08.629
as they're consumed
by this... phage?

36:08.699 --> 36:11.998
Our immunotechnology
cannot keep up.

36:12.069 --> 36:14.503
The phage adapts.

36:14.572 --> 36:16.039
lt resists all attempts

36:16.107 --> 36:17.699
to destroy it.

36:17.775 --> 36:20.767
Our society has been ravaged.

36:20.845 --> 36:23.575
Thousands die each day.

36:23.648 --> 36:28.210
There is no other way
for us to survive.

36:30.855 --> 36:33.153
l have a great...

36:33.224 --> 36:36.785
sympathy for what
your race has endured.

36:36.861 --> 36:39.557
But l cannot allow you
to keep the organs you removed

36:39.630 --> 36:41.291
from one of our crew members.

36:41.365 --> 36:43.526
We need them back immediately.

36:46.571 --> 36:51.372
l'm afraid that isn't possible.

36:51.442 --> 36:54.411
l have already
biochemically altered

36:54.478 --> 36:57.345
the air-breathing organs

36:57.415 --> 37:02.114
and grafted them
into Motura's body.

37:02.186 --> 37:05.178
They are a part of him now.

37:09.327 --> 37:11.727
He is my honatta.

37:11.796 --> 37:16.995
His task is to find
the organs l need for survival.

37:17.068 --> 37:19.366
We...

37:19.437 --> 37:23.874
we try to extract them
from the dead...

37:23.941 --> 37:28.378
But sometimes,
when the need is immediate

37:28.446 --> 37:32.746
more aggressive actions
are required.

37:32.817 --> 37:36.753
So now l am left with
the same choice you made--

37:36.821 --> 37:40.587
whether to commit murder
to save a life,

37:40.658 --> 37:45.061
or to allow my own crewman
to die

37:45.129 --> 37:48.690
while you breathe air
through his lungs.

37:50.935 --> 37:55.599
lt must be impossible
for you to understand

37:55.673 --> 38:02.636
how any civilized people
could come to... this.

38:04.282 --> 38:06.944
Before the phage began,

38:07.018 --> 38:10.749
we were known as educators
and explorers--

38:10.821 --> 38:15.315
a people whose greatest
achievements were artistic.

38:15.393 --> 38:19.591
l, myself, am a sculptor
of note on my world.

38:19.664 --> 38:26.433
All l can say is that when your
entire existence is at stake...

38:26.504 --> 38:31.203
You don't have to explain
yourself, Motura.

38:34.078 --> 38:39.675
lf the consequence of this act
is a death sentence,

38:39.750 --> 38:41.809
so be it.

38:41.886 --> 38:45.014
At least it will put
an end to my suffering.

38:48.326 --> 38:52.228
l can't begin to understand what
your people have gone through.

38:52.296 --> 38:55.390
They may have found a way
to ignore the moral implications

38:55.466 --> 38:58.765
of what you're doing,
but l have no such luxury.

38:58.836 --> 39:02.636
l don't have the freedom
to kill you to save another.

39:02.740 --> 39:05.732
My culture finds that
to be a reprehensible

39:05.776 --> 39:08.404
and entirely unacceptable act.

39:08.479 --> 39:09.810
lf we were closer to home,

39:09.880 --> 39:13.179
l would lock you up and turn you
over to my authorities for trial

39:13.250 --> 39:15.309
but l don't even have
that ability here,

39:15.386 --> 39:18.378
and l am not prepared to carry
you forever in our brig.

39:20.524 --> 39:23.118
So l see no other alternative...

39:26.630 --> 39:28.723
but to let you go.

39:28.899 --> 39:31.595
Take a message to your people.

39:31.669 --> 39:34.797
lf l ever encounter
your kind again,

39:34.872 --> 39:38.569
l will do whatever is necessary
to protect my people

39:38.642 --> 39:42.237
from this...
harvesting of yours.

39:42.313 --> 39:45.282
Any aggressive actions
against this ship

39:45.349 --> 39:49.581
or its crew will be met
by the deadliest force.

39:49.653 --> 39:52.554
ls that clear?

39:54.859 --> 39:56.884
Uh... quite.

39:58.396 --> 39:59.863
Wait.

39:59.930 --> 40:03.923
l want to see
this crewman of yours.

40:04.001 --> 40:06.936
That can serve
no useful purpose.

40:07.037 --> 40:09.130
Maybe it can.

40:09.206 --> 40:12.334
Our medical technologies
may be superior to theirs.

40:12.410 --> 40:15.436
l can tell you, from what
we've observed of them,

40:15.513 --> 40:18.482
that they are
considerably superior.

40:19.683 --> 40:22.379
She spared my life--

40:22.453 --> 40:24.478
our lives.

40:24.555 --> 40:26.147
We owe it to them to see

40:26.223 --> 40:29.192
if there's anything we
can do to help him.

40:31.562 --> 40:32.722
l'll take you to him.

40:45.576 --> 40:50.275
His simulated organs
are primitive.

40:50.347 --> 40:53.942
lt's amazing he is still alive.

40:58.489 --> 41:03.188
This is set to scan only.

41:03.294 --> 41:04.727
Proceed...

41:04.762 --> 41:06.286
carefully.

41:28.686 --> 41:30.677
Strange.

41:30.754 --> 41:34.850
According to my readings,
you are not here.

41:34.925 --> 41:38.417
Believe me, l wish l weren't.

41:42.933 --> 41:45.993
The rest of you are healthy.

41:46.070 --> 41:49.631
You are compatible
for organ transplant.

41:49.707 --> 41:52.505
Wait a minute.
We've already considered this.

41:52.576 --> 41:54.271
Talaxian physiology
is different

41:54.345 --> 41:56.438
from that of anyone else
on this ship.

41:56.514 --> 41:59.574
His immune system would
reject their lungs immediately.

41:59.650 --> 42:03.347
Your surgical knowledge
is inferior.

42:03.454 --> 42:07.618
We will simply adapt
his immunogenicity.

42:07.658 --> 42:09.717
lt won't be a problem.

42:09.793 --> 42:15.197
Which of you will donate a lung?

42:15.266 --> 42:16.198
Me.

42:16.267 --> 42:17.632
No!

42:17.701 --> 42:19.794
Absolutely not.
lt's too dangerous.

42:19.870 --> 42:21.098
Let someone else do it.

42:21.171 --> 42:22.900
No, l want to do it, Neelix.

42:22.973 --> 42:24.702
l'm willing to take the risk.

42:24.775 --> 42:27.437
Besides, you've done
so much for me.

42:27.511 --> 42:29.877
Let me give you something once.

42:29.947 --> 42:32.415
Just for once.

42:34.718 --> 42:36.481
All right.

42:43.994 --> 42:45.586
l look forward

42:45.663 --> 42:48.393
to sampling your cooking,
Mr. Neelix.

42:48.465 --> 42:52.526
You mean l can keep my kitchen?

42:52.603 --> 42:57.370
Well, at least until we get
the replicators back on line.

42:57.441 --> 42:59.136
Thank you, Captain.

42:59.209 --> 43:01.439
And, Captain...

43:01.545 --> 43:03.536
l'll see you at breakfast.

43:10.187 --> 43:12.417
Captain's Log, supplemental.

43:12.489 --> 43:14.218
The aliens have successfully
transplanted

43:14.291 --> 43:16.418
one of Kes's lungs into Neelix.

43:16.493 --> 43:18.358
The dampening field
has been deactivated,

43:18.429 --> 43:21.023
and l have allowed them
to beam back to their vessel.

43:21.098 --> 43:22.565
We are resuming a course home.

43:34.144 --> 43:35.634
lt's all right.

43:35.713 --> 43:38.238
The operation was a success.

43:38.315 --> 43:41.716
Neelix is asleep
and breathing on his own now...

43:41.785 --> 43:43.480
with your lung.

43:44.488 --> 43:46.854
l feel a little light-headed.

43:46.924 --> 43:48.186
That will pass.

43:48.258 --> 43:50.988
You'll soon adapt
to diminished lung capacity.

43:51.061 --> 43:54.087
l spoke to the Captain
about you.

43:54.164 --> 43:55.256
She's given me permission

43:55.332 --> 43:57.323
to begin training you
as a medical assistant.

43:57.401 --> 43:59.733
You'll be a backup for Mr. Paris

43:59.803 --> 44:03.261
or, possibly, a replacement.

44:03.374 --> 44:06.901
That is, assuming
you're interested.

44:06.944 --> 44:09.174
Of course l'm interested.

44:09.246 --> 44:11.180
When do we start?

44:11.248 --> 44:15.014
We'll begin your lessons as soon
as you've fully recovered.

44:17.454 --> 44:19.183
Thank you, Doctor.

44:21.091 --> 44:22.922
Thank you.

44:23.027 --> 44:27.123
You've... given me
a lot to think about.
