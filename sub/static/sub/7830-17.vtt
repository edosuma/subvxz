<i>♪ The Simpsons ♪</i>

00:06.297 --> 00:07.215
(tires screech)

00:09.300 --> 00:10.552
D'oh!

00:10.635 --> 00:12.887
-(screams)
-(tires screech)

00:16.975 --> 00:17.976
(screams)

00:35.994 --> 00:38.997
Tonight on
"Eye on Springfield"--

00:39.080 --> 00:41.958
Opening day at the world's
first two-story outhouse.

00:43.084 --> 00:44.919
MAN: Oh, God! Stop!

00:45.003 --> 00:49.215
A comedy nurse who's laughing
all the way to the blood bank.

00:49.299 --> 00:53.511
Okay, how many of you are here
for shoulder surgery, huh?

00:53.595 --> 00:55.805
(people groaning)

00:55.889 --> 00:57.098
Gotcha!

00:57.182 --> 00:59.934
But first,
move over, Baltimore.

01:00.018 --> 01:02.729
Springfield
has stolen your idea.

01:02.812 --> 01:04.606
I'm walking
on the waterfront--

01:04.689 --> 01:07.484
Once the center of a thriving
squid-gutting industry,

01:07.567 --> 01:09.944
now abandoned by all
but a few longshoremen

01:10.028 --> 01:11.613
and allied tradespeople.

01:11.696 --> 01:13.740
But the decades of rot will end

01:13.823 --> 01:16.242
with the opening
of the South Street Squidport,

01:16.326 --> 01:17.660
an upscale
shopping promenade

01:17.744 --> 01:19.954
with authentic
maritime theming.

01:21.289 --> 01:22.874
And to kick it all off in style

01:22.957 --> 01:26.961
area merchants will host
a black-tie gala Saturday night.

01:27.045 --> 01:30.006
Ooh, that sounds
fabulous, Homer.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.800
Stores throw
the best parties.

01:31.883 --> 01:33.635
You like parties, huh?

01:33.718 --> 01:35.804
Well, I just remembered
they're having a big one

01:35.887 --> 01:37.806
down at the waterfront
this weekend.

01:37.889 --> 01:39.015
You didn't
remember that.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.600
You just saw it on TV.

01:40.683 --> 01:42.852
The important thing
is I didn't imagine it.

01:44.729 --> 01:47.232
I can't get enough
of "The BabySitter Twins."

01:47.315 --> 01:48.983
They arrested
the counterfeiters,

01:49.067 --> 01:52.654
rescued the president
and made four dollars.

01:52.737 --> 01:54.906
I love everything about
the world of baby-sitting--

01:54.989 --> 01:58.535
The responsibility,
the obligation, the pressure...

01:58.618 --> 02:00.870
And full refrigerator
privileges.

02:00.954 --> 02:03.915
That's a trust, Janey,
a sacred trust.

02:03.998 --> 02:06.793
jeez, lighten up, Lisa.

02:06.876 --> 02:08.878
(organ plays)

02:08.962 --> 02:11.464
LOVEJOY:
That concludes our service.

02:11.548 --> 02:13.383
All right, I have
two announcements.

02:13.466 --> 02:14.801
Friday you will have the chance

02:14.884 --> 02:17.554
to party down
in the church basement

02:17.637 --> 02:20.598
to the Jesus rock
stylings of Testament.

02:20.682 --> 02:23.268
That's Friday,
6 p.m. sharp.

02:23.351 --> 02:26.396
All the best bands are
affiliated with Satan.

02:26.479 --> 02:30.483
Also, anyone in need of a reliable
and affordable baby-sitter

02:30.567 --> 02:32.485
should call
Lisa Simpson.

02:32.569 --> 02:34.654
Mention the topic
of today's sermon

02:34.737 --> 02:36.698
to get a dollar off.

02:36.781 --> 02:39.617
(man coughing)

02:39.701 --> 02:40.869
(clearing throat)

02:40.952 --> 02:42.120
The topic was love.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.707
Why hasn't anyone called?

02:45.790 --> 02:49.335
Maybe people don't want an
eight-year-old baby-sitter, honey.

02:49.419 --> 02:51.129
Parents need to be sure

02:51.212 --> 02:53.298
their sitter can handle
anything that might happen.

02:53.381 --> 02:55.383
That's why they hire teenagers.

02:55.466 --> 02:57.760
But, but I'm very
mature for my age.

02:57.844 --> 03:00.180
People often
mistake me for nine.

03:00.263 --> 03:01.723
(doorbell chimes)

03:01.806 --> 03:05.894
Homer, I've got a Fozzie
of a bear of a problem.

03:05.977 --> 03:08.688
That Maude and her mother
were visiting Tyre and Sidon,

03:08.771 --> 03:10.148
the twin cities
of the holy land.

03:10.231 --> 03:11.399
They must have kneeled
in the wrong place

03:11.482 --> 03:13.651
and prayed to
the wrong god

03:13.735 --> 03:16.946
because, well, they're being held prisoner
by militants of some sort.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.824
Militants, huh? Well, if I were you,
I'd kick their asses.

03:19.908 --> 03:21.784
Well, any hoodily-doodle,
the embassy says

03:21.868 --> 03:23.286
it's just a routine
hostage taking

03:23.369 --> 03:25.705
but I have to drive
to Capitol City,

03:25.788 --> 03:26.998
fill out some forms
to get them out.

03:27.081 --> 03:29.125
Could you possibly
watch the kids tonight?

03:29.209 --> 03:32.754
Oh, gee, I'd really love
to want to help you, Flanders

03:32.837 --> 03:35.965
but, uh... Marge was...

03:36.049 --> 03:39.677
Taken prisoner in, uh...

03:39.761 --> 03:41.012
Holy land, and, uh...

03:41.095 --> 03:43.389
I'll do it!
I'll baby-sit!

03:43.473 --> 03:44.474
Well, I don't know, Lisa.

03:44.557 --> 03:45.850
You're awfully young,

03:45.934 --> 03:47.936
and the boys
can be a handful.

03:48.019 --> 03:50.313
Todd's been pinching
everyone lately.

03:50.396 --> 03:51.773
But I'm smart and responsible

03:51.856 --> 03:53.983
and my parents
will be right next door.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.027
Well, what do
you say, Homer?

03:56.110 --> 03:57.570
Can Lisa baby-sit
for my kids?

03:57.654 --> 03:58.571
Please, please,
please?

03:58.655 --> 04:00.198
Well, I'll have to ask her.

04:05.995 --> 04:06.996
Where are the dice?

04:07.080 --> 04:09.707
Daddy says dice are wicked.

04:09.791 --> 04:11.793
We just move
one space at a time.

04:11.876 --> 04:13.461
It's less fun that way.

04:14.671 --> 04:15.755
-Moth! Moth!
-Moth! Moth!

04:15.838 --> 04:17.966
Moth-moth-moth!

04:18.049 --> 04:19.425
Don't worry.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.219
A moth is no more harmful
than a ladybug.

04:21.302 --> 04:22.762
-A ladybug?
-A ladybug?

04:22.845 --> 04:25.807
(both screaming)

04:25.890 --> 04:29.352
Uh, they're going to get
eaten alive in middle school.

04:29.435 --> 04:30.853
And thank you
for sending Lisa

04:30.937 --> 04:33.147
to protect us
from the bug you sent.

04:33.231 --> 04:37.735
And please make Lisa
tell us a bedtime story...

04:37.819 --> 04:39.612
about robots...

04:39.696 --> 04:41.447
named Rod and Todd.

04:41.531 --> 04:42.699
Amen.

04:44.826 --> 04:47.537
Once there was
a robot named Todd...

04:47.620 --> 04:48.913
Did he have a brother?

04:48.997 --> 04:51.791
Yes, he had a brother
robot named Rod

04:51.874 --> 04:54.669
who was two space
years older than him.

04:54.752 --> 04:56.629
I don't like this story!

04:57.880 --> 04:59.632
Oh, imagine that:

04:59.716 --> 05:02.635
sleeping quietly
after a bug attack

05:02.719 --> 05:04.887
and Todd's as
dry as a bone.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.472
Lisa, you're a wonder.

05:06.556 --> 05:09.267
I'm going to recommend you
to everybody.

05:10.810 --> 05:12.270
So long, Lisa.

05:12.353 --> 05:15.690
If anything goes
wrong, just dial 911.

05:15.773 --> 05:17.608
Unless it's an emergency.

05:17.692 --> 05:19.694
LISA:
Okay, chief. Enjoy Bob Saget.

05:19.777 --> 05:22.655
Ha! It's Bob Seger.

05:22.739 --> 05:24.449
Aw, crap.

05:24.532 --> 05:26.909
Now, put your left leg
into the left side

05:26.993 --> 05:28.786
of the pants
and you're done.

05:28.870 --> 05:31.664
I dressed myself.

05:33.916 --> 05:35.752
Hey, Dad. How come you're
wearing a tuxedo?

05:35.835 --> 05:38.629
Going to that fancy
waterfront party tomorrow.

05:38.713 --> 05:40.131
Why are you wearing it now?

05:40.214 --> 05:41.716
It's like a rent-a-car, son.

05:41.799 --> 05:44.886
You get all the mileage you can,
then ball it up

05:44.969 --> 05:46.846
and cram it through
the mail slot.

05:49.015 --> 05:50.725
(car door slams)

05:50.808 --> 05:52.727
LISA:
Thanks for the ride.

05:52.810 --> 05:54.979
You did a first-rate
job of baby-sitting.

05:55.063 --> 05:57.315
I've never seen such
a responsible young lady.

05:57.398 --> 05:58.900
Thank you, Dr. Hibbert.

05:58.983 --> 06:00.777
Your trust means so much to me.

06:00.860 --> 06:03.821
I only wish my Volvo
mechanic were as reliable.

06:03.905 --> 06:04.906
(chuckling)

06:04.989 --> 06:06.199
Good night, Lisa.

06:11.496 --> 06:13.039
You made all that money

06:13.122 --> 06:16.084
for sitting around and
watching TV and eating food?

06:16.167 --> 06:18.086
There's a lot more
to it than that, Bart.

06:18.169 --> 06:19.629
I don't just baby-sit.

06:19.712 --> 06:22.465
I sell peace of mind
for a dollar an hour.

06:22.548 --> 06:24.300
Two dollars after 9:00.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.094
Man, if I was making
that kind of money

06:26.177 --> 06:27.720
I'd be out of
here so fast...

06:31.724 --> 06:33.893
(giggles)

06:33.976 --> 06:35.937
LISA:
You look so glamorous, Mom.

06:36.020 --> 06:39.065
Oh, and you smell
like vanilla flowers.

06:39.148 --> 06:40.858
Dad, you look
totally classy.

06:40.942 --> 06:42.652
You could be Abe Lincoln's
father's boss.

06:42.735 --> 06:44.404
Can you see the pie stains?

06:44.487 --> 06:45.822
It'll be dark.

06:45.905 --> 06:47.698
So, when's Grampa getting here
to baby-sit?

06:47.782 --> 06:49.909
Mmm, Grampa's not coming.

06:49.992 --> 06:52.036
Oh, not Patty and Selma.

06:52.120 --> 06:55.206
Actually, Bart, Lisa's
going to be in charge tonight.

06:55.289 --> 06:57.166
-What?
-I know she's young,

06:57.250 --> 07:00.086
but Lisa has proven herself
mature and dependable.

07:00.169 --> 07:01.712
Dad, help me out.

07:01.796 --> 07:03.005
Take it like a man, boy,

07:03.089 --> 07:04.674
and do everything
your little sister says.

07:04.757 --> 07:06.175
This is an outrage.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.219
I am two years and 38 days
older than she is!

07:08.302 --> 07:10.763
This is the greatest injustice
in the history of the world!

07:10.847 --> 07:12.265
Well, we have to run.

07:12.348 --> 07:13.516
I'm sure you kids
will work things out.

07:13.599 --> 07:14.642
Good night.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.938
Make sure he brushes
his teeth, Lisa.

07:26.237 --> 07:27.405
Bart, I know
you're not wild

07:27.488 --> 07:28.948
about having me
for a babysitter

07:29.031 --> 07:31.159
but I'm not some ogre.

07:31.242 --> 07:33.536
I think you will find me
fair and fun.

07:33.619 --> 07:34.996
You're dead.

07:35.079 --> 07:36.497
You should wash up for dinner.

07:36.581 --> 07:38.708
To make it fun,
you can use the Mr. Bubble.

07:38.791 --> 07:41.002
It'll be like giving
your fingers a bubble bath.

07:41.085 --> 07:42.420
You are so dead.

07:42.503 --> 07:43.379
(clattering)

07:45.423 --> 07:48.426
Ah, I love this
pedestrian mall.

07:48.509 --> 07:50.428
It's practically
no traffic.

07:50.511 --> 07:51.554
(honking horn)

07:51.637 --> 07:53.598
(gasping)

07:53.681 --> 07:56.184
Mmm. I don't think
we should be driving here.

07:56.267 --> 07:58.311
The mayor's yelling at us.

07:58.394 --> 07:59.395
MAN:
Stop, you idiots!

07:59.479 --> 08:00.938
All right, all right.

08:01.022 --> 08:02.482
Jeez.

08:02.565 --> 08:04.442
Okay, honey, remember
where we're parked.

08:12.909 --> 08:15.077
May I have some more
lima beans, please?

08:15.161 --> 08:16.245
Certainly.

08:16.329 --> 08:17.246
More than that.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.831
Certainly.

08:18.915 --> 08:20.208
More.

08:20.291 --> 08:23.211
More.
More.

08:23.294 --> 08:25.087
Maybe you should eat
the ones you have.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.048
I didn't say I was
going to eat them.

08:27.131 --> 08:28.466
I just wanted
to look at them

08:28.549 --> 08:29.634
because they're
so gross.

08:29.717 --> 08:31.385
What's for dessert?

08:31.469 --> 08:33.596
Bart, if you don't want
to have a baby-sitter,

08:33.679 --> 08:36.182
maybe you should stop
being such a baby.

08:36.265 --> 08:37.850
Oh, I'm a baby, huh?

08:37.934 --> 08:39.644
Well, then,
I'll act like a baby.

08:39.727 --> 08:42.104
Ga-ga-goo-goo.

08:42.188 --> 08:45.024
Even babies know how to open
and close their mouths.

08:45.107 --> 08:46.025
You need a bib.

08:46.108 --> 08:48.736
Oh, baby hate bib.

08:48.819 --> 08:51.197
Waah! Waah!
Waaah! Waaah!

08:51.280 --> 08:53.491
(crying)

08:53.574 --> 08:55.034
Oh, look, Bart.

08:55.117 --> 08:56.494
Now you got Maggie
all upset.

08:56.577 --> 08:58.412
Relax. I'll give her
some ice cream.

08:58.496 --> 09:00.456
(slurping)

09:01.916 --> 09:04.460
Bart, that's
coffee ice cream.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.420
It has
caffeine in it.

09:06.504 --> 09:08.339
Well, I guess that'll make
things more interesting

09:08.422 --> 09:09.840
for you now,
won't it?

09:12.969 --> 09:16.973
Ooh! It's so beautiful.

09:17.056 --> 09:19.267
This is what I imagine
Paris must be like.

09:19.350 --> 09:20.851
You've never been?

09:20.935 --> 09:23.062
I'm so honored that Springfield
has been chosen

09:23.145 --> 09:25.439
to host all these
upscale chain stores.

09:25.523 --> 09:28.150
I guess this makes us
yuppies, huh, Homie?

09:28.234 --> 09:30.319
Nah, I'm really
more of a slacker.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.321
Ooh!

09:32.405 --> 09:34.323
Malaria Zone.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.284
That's where all
the explorers shop.

09:36.367 --> 09:37.577
Look, Marge!

09:37.660 --> 09:40.288
A restaurant owned
by celebrities.

09:40.371 --> 09:42.540
I always wanted
to be a celebrity.

09:43.749 --> 09:45.668
Ha-ha! Yes, it's true.

09:45.751 --> 09:50.298
The entire menu was personally
approved by my secretary.

09:50.381 --> 09:52.049
Isn't that clever?

09:52.133 --> 09:54.802
It looks like a Cadillac
drove right into the building.

09:54.885 --> 09:56.137
Help me.

09:56.220 --> 10:00.266
Wow. Even Moe's moved
to fancy new digs.

10:07.273 --> 10:10.860
Hey, this isn't
faux dive.

10:10.943 --> 10:12.486
This is a dive.

10:12.570 --> 10:15.197
You're a long way
from home, yuppie boy.

10:15.281 --> 10:16.991
I'll start a tab.

10:17.074 --> 10:21.954
Maggie, if you come down,
I'll give you some more coffee.

10:22.038 --> 10:24.206
Lots more coffee.

10:24.290 --> 10:26.083
(fast sucking sounds)

10:26.167 --> 10:28.377
Are you getting ready
for bed, Bart?

10:28.461 --> 10:30.004
I am!

10:30.087 --> 10:31.464
That's right.

10:31.547 --> 10:33.841
I want the 25-foot
Italian party sub.

10:33.924 --> 10:35.551
And don't skimp
on the vinegar.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.386
It's time Lisa learned

10:37.470 --> 10:40.139
what baby-sitting Bart Simpson
is all about.

10:42.433 --> 10:45.561
Um, yes, I'd like to host
an A.A. meeting.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.563
Tonight if possible.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.774
Come on, Maggie.

10:49.857 --> 10:52.360
Good Maggie.

10:52.443 --> 10:56.447
The talcum powder's
not to play with.

10:56.530 --> 10:58.324
(coughing)

10:58.407 --> 10:59.700
(groaning)
Ohh...

11:02.411 --> 11:06.165
Okay, Bart now it's really time
for you to go to bed.

11:11.295 --> 11:12.588
(grunting)

11:12.672 --> 11:15.800
Why do you have
to make this so hard?

11:15.883 --> 11:17.968
I'm using nonviolent resistance.

11:18.052 --> 11:21.722
The idea that you would compare
yourself to Mahatma Gandhi...

11:21.806 --> 11:23.516
-Who?
-(doorbell chimes)

11:23.599 --> 11:24.892
I'll answer it.

11:24.975 --> 11:25.851
You go to bed.

11:30.648 --> 11:31.691
Good evening
there, miss.

11:31.774 --> 11:33.234
Here's your giant sub

11:33.317 --> 11:35.695
swimming in vinegar
just the way you like it.

11:35.778 --> 11:38.698
It's going to be
$225 plus tip.

11:38.781 --> 11:41.492
What? I didn't order
any giant sub.

11:41.575 --> 11:42.993
(doorbell chimes)

11:43.077 --> 11:44.954
Hey, hey!

11:45.037 --> 11:46.580
Are you ready to get rowdy?

11:46.664 --> 11:48.374
Excuse me?

11:48.457 --> 11:51.001
Somebody hired me for an emergency
bachelor party.

11:51.085 --> 11:53.212
Well, there's been a mistake.

11:53.295 --> 11:56.549
Well, I'm not leaving
till I get paid.

11:56.632 --> 11:58.426
I get 500 just
for "Hey, hey."

11:58.509 --> 12:00.052
(siren wailing)

12:00.136 --> 12:02.012
Who called for an emergency
sisterectomy?

12:02.096 --> 12:03.639
(growls)

12:03.723 --> 12:05.558
(shutter clicks)

12:05.641 --> 12:06.767
(doorbell chimes)

12:06.851 --> 12:08.102
We got a report

12:08.185 --> 12:10.604
that a Lisa Simpson
spotted a U.F.O.

12:10.688 --> 12:12.773
I didn't see any U.F.O.!

12:12.857 --> 12:14.316
That's right, miss.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.693
You didn't.

12:17.903 --> 12:20.281
I'm here to pick up
the ambassador from Ghana.

12:20.364 --> 12:22.616
Well, he's not here!
Nobody's here!

12:22.700 --> 12:23.951
None of you
should be here!

12:24.034 --> 12:25.661
You've all been tricked!

12:25.745 --> 12:27.997
Why would the ambassador
do such a thing?

12:28.080 --> 12:29.081
This is ridiculous.

12:29.165 --> 12:30.207
I'm going to
bill them later.

12:30.291 --> 12:33.085
Bart, you are going to be

12:33.169 --> 12:36.046
in so much trouble when
Mom and Dad get home.

12:36.130 --> 12:37.465
Now, go to bed!

12:37.548 --> 12:38.966
You're the boss.

12:40.718 --> 12:42.595
(groans)

12:42.678 --> 12:44.805
I thought I told
you to go to bed.

12:44.889 --> 12:46.390
Yeah, right. Bread.

12:46.474 --> 12:48.184
You said go to "bread."

12:48.267 --> 12:50.644
I said go to bed.

12:50.728 --> 12:52.396
Yeah, go to "bread."

12:52.480 --> 12:54.648
B-E-D! Bed!

12:54.732 --> 12:57.902
Oh... Bed.

12:57.985 --> 12:59.028
Oh.

12:59.111 --> 13:00.446
Well, anything
you say, sis.

13:06.452 --> 13:08.412
You didn't say which bed.

13:08.496 --> 13:10.039
Go to your bed!

13:10.122 --> 13:11.207
-Make me.
-I'll make you.

13:12.666 --> 13:14.210
If you want me,
you got to catch me.

13:14.293 --> 13:15.961
(snarls)

13:16.045 --> 13:18.005
-Almost.
-(snarls)

13:18.088 --> 13:20.424
-Oh, so close.
-Bart!

13:20.508 --> 13:23.135
(grunting)

13:24.512 --> 13:25.971
Son of a--

13:28.224 --> 13:29.934
Oh, my God.

13:30.017 --> 13:32.102
Okay, we'll call it even

13:32.186 --> 13:34.146
if I can just have some
of that big sandwich.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.898
Oh...

13:35.981 --> 13:37.733
I'll come back.

13:42.404 --> 13:44.323
Bart, are you okay?

13:44.406 --> 13:46.867
Ohh. Yeah, I think so.

13:46.951 --> 13:50.079
It's just a bump
on my head.

13:50.162 --> 13:51.288
Ew, your arm.

13:51.372 --> 13:52.873
It's got extra
corners.

13:52.957 --> 13:55.459
Yah! Oh, cool.

13:55.543 --> 13:57.253
It must be dislocated
or something.

13:57.336 --> 13:59.463
We have to get you
to the emergency room.

13:59.547 --> 14:02.091
And get this fixed?
What's the rush?

14:02.174 --> 14:03.342
Don't you want
everyone to see

14:03.425 --> 14:05.427
what a responsible
baby-sitter you were?

14:05.511 --> 14:07.888
Stop it. Stand still.

14:07.972 --> 14:09.348
Maybe I can pop it back in.

14:09.431 --> 14:11.684
No, I'm going to preserve
the evidence

14:11.767 --> 14:13.853
until Mom and Dad get home.

14:13.936 --> 14:15.813
And you'll never
baby-sit again!

14:17.398 --> 14:18.858
(door slams, locks)

14:18.941 --> 14:20.734
You know, honey

14:20.818 --> 14:22.778
when I think of all the good
times we've had together...

14:22.862 --> 14:24.530
Yeow!

14:24.613 --> 14:26.156
Did you see that, Marge?

14:26.240 --> 14:28.284
Oh, my God, you walked
into the fountain.

14:28.367 --> 14:30.119
Get out of
the fountain!

14:30.202 --> 14:31.203
(shrieking)

14:31.287 --> 14:32.663
I can't get out.

14:32.746 --> 14:34.999
Just stand still
and I'll get someone.

14:35.082 --> 14:37.167
I can't get out.

14:37.251 --> 14:39.128
(sobbing)

14:40.504 --> 14:43.257
(crowd laughing)

14:45.009 --> 14:46.343
Don't laugh at me.

14:46.427 --> 14:49.305
I was once like you.

14:49.388 --> 14:51.432
Bart, you need first aid.

14:51.515 --> 14:52.850
Let me in.

14:52.933 --> 14:55.102
I'm afraid
you'll hurt me again.

14:55.185 --> 14:56.896
Bart, if you come out,

14:56.979 --> 15:00.024
I'll let you eat
raw cookie dough.

15:00.107 --> 15:01.775
I'll let you...

15:01.859 --> 15:04.236
ride the lawn mower
through the house.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.780
Come on, open the door!

15:06.864 --> 15:07.781
(pounding)

15:07.865 --> 15:09.366
What are you doing now?

15:09.450 --> 15:10.868
BART: I'm banging
my head.

15:10.951 --> 15:12.786
I'm going to make
the lump even bigger.

15:12.870 --> 15:15.789
(chuckling)

15:15.873 --> 15:17.791
No! As your baby-sitter

15:17.875 --> 15:20.586
I order you to stop hitting
your head on the wall!

15:20.669 --> 15:23.088
(thump)

15:23.172 --> 15:24.048
Bart?

15:25.633 --> 15:28.969
Did you stop
because I said to?

15:29.053 --> 15:32.431
If so, thank you.

15:32.514 --> 15:33.849
Bart?

15:33.933 --> 15:36.060
(whimpering)

15:36.143 --> 15:37.436
(gasps)

15:41.565 --> 15:42.691
(gasps)

15:44.026 --> 15:44.985
(beeping)

15:45.069 --> 15:46.028
WOMAN: <i>911.</i>

15:46.111 --> 15:47.905
Hello, this is Lisa Simpson...

15:47.988 --> 15:50.449
<i>Simpson? Look, we've already</i>
<i>been out there tonight</i>

15:50.532 --> 15:52.201
<i>for a sisterectomy,</i>

15:52.284 --> 15:54.787
<i>a case of severe butt-rot,</i>
<i>and a leprechaun bite.</i>

15:54.870 --> 15:56.747
<i>How dumb</i>
<i>do you think we are?</i>

15:56.830 --> 15:58.207
(dial tone)

15:58.290 --> 15:59.792
Oh.

15:59.875 --> 16:01.043
Wait. Dr. Hibbert.

16:11.512 --> 16:12.846
Hmm...

16:12.930 --> 16:16.725
Dislocated shoulder,
bump on the noggin.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.435
My diagnosis?

16:18.519 --> 16:19.728
Bad baby-sitting.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.316
Well, near
as we can tell,

16:24.400 --> 16:25.901
the boy was
studying quietly,

16:25.985 --> 16:27.361
when the girl,

16:27.444 --> 16:29.446
drunk on her
own sense of power,

16:29.530 --> 16:33.033
beat him silly with a block of
frozen lima beans.

16:33.117 --> 16:34.702
It's true!

16:34.785 --> 16:37.830
Young lady, you will
never baby-sit again.

16:37.913 --> 16:40.249
I am so disappointed.

16:40.332 --> 16:41.917
(echoing)

16:45.212 --> 16:48.424
Oh, well, I guess
I don't have a choice.

16:51.552 --> 16:53.971
"Complete confidentiality"?

16:54.054 --> 16:57.099
Oh? And I'm sure
he's as good as Dr. Hibbert.

16:57.182 --> 16:58.892
It says so
right in his ad.

17:02.479 --> 17:03.856
What's
the matter, Marge?

17:03.939 --> 17:05.691
I thought you loved
Jell-O shooters.

17:05.774 --> 17:07.735
(slurping)

17:07.818 --> 17:09.820
Oh, I do.

17:09.903 --> 17:11.989
I'm just a little concerned
about the kids.

17:12.072 --> 17:13.866
Maybe I should call.

17:13.949 --> 17:15.909
Oh, come on,
Marge, relax.

17:15.993 --> 17:17.911
Lisa's in charge.

17:17.995 --> 17:19.955
She's
the responsible one.

17:20.039 --> 17:20.998
(grunts)

17:21.081 --> 17:22.541
Hold on, Bart.

17:22.624 --> 17:24.585
Everything's going
to be just fine.

17:24.668 --> 17:26.211
I'm going to get you
to a doctor.

17:26.295 --> 17:28.047
He will fix you up.

17:28.130 --> 17:30.883
And by this time tomorrow,
we'll all be a happy family.

17:30.966 --> 17:32.885
Happy, happy,
happy family.

17:32.968 --> 17:34.762
(babbling)

17:34.845 --> 17:36.930
Maggie!

17:45.022 --> 17:50.152
Please, Maggie.
Please go to sleep.

18:00.329 --> 18:03.957
Yo, um, I must have, like,
fallen on a bullet,

18:04.041 --> 18:06.710
and it, like, drove
itself into my gut.

18:09.004 --> 18:10.547
Hey, don't worry.

18:10.631 --> 18:12.800
You don't have
to make up stories here.

18:12.883 --> 18:14.885
Save that for court.

18:17.846 --> 18:19.973
Um, excuse me,
Mr. Smithers.

18:20.057 --> 18:21.809
Bart may be
seriously hurt.

18:21.892 --> 18:23.811
Could we possibly
go ahead of you?

18:23.894 --> 18:25.646
Um... No.

18:25.729 --> 18:28.148
I really would rather
get this taken care of.

18:28.232 --> 18:30.984
Excuse me, little lady.

18:31.068 --> 18:32.319
The wheelbarrow line
is over there.

18:34.071 --> 18:37.116
Ooh, loneliness
and cheeseburgers

18:37.199 --> 18:39.118
are a dangerous mix.

18:39.201 --> 18:40.619
(groans)

18:45.040 --> 18:45.999
(siren blaring)

18:46.083 --> 18:47.668
Hold it right there.

18:49.545 --> 18:51.421
Well, if it isn't
Springfield's

18:51.505 --> 18:54.174
finest little baby-sitter,
Lisa Simpson.

18:54.258 --> 18:57.177
-Hi. How are you?
-Um, I'm fine.

18:57.261 --> 18:58.720
Now, Lisa, when
you're walking

18:58.804 --> 18:59.847
down the side
of the road,

18:59.930 --> 19:01.098
you always want
to be sure

19:01.181 --> 19:03.600
to go with
traffic, okay?

19:03.684 --> 19:05.978
Well, is that with traffic
or against traffic?

19:06.061 --> 19:06.979
No, it's with traffic--
with traffic.

19:07.062 --> 19:08.480
Anyway, good night.

19:08.564 --> 19:10.357
(sighs)

19:10.440 --> 19:12.025
Uh, hold on
a minute.

19:12.109 --> 19:14.820
Let me have a look at
that wheelbarrow, please.

19:14.903 --> 19:16.363
Okay.

19:20.284 --> 19:21.869
Just as I thought.

19:21.952 --> 19:24.037
It's a Yard King.

19:24.121 --> 19:25.831
That is
a quality barrow.

19:25.914 --> 19:27.875
Well, I got to run.

19:27.958 --> 19:29.918
(engine starting)

19:30.002 --> 19:32.379
(car departs)

19:32.462 --> 19:34.298
Oh, God.

19:34.381 --> 19:35.549
Where's Bart?

19:35.632 --> 19:37.593
(gasps)

19:38.760 --> 19:40.929
(Lisa moaning)

19:43.599 --> 19:44.975
(moaning)

19:49.396 --> 19:50.856
(grunts)

19:50.939 --> 19:53.025
Oh, Bart,
I'm so sorry.

19:53.108 --> 19:55.485
This is all
like a bad dream.

19:55.569 --> 19:57.362
(switch clicks)

19:57.446 --> 19:59.364
Citizens of Springfield,

19:59.448 --> 20:01.700
I officially declare this--

20:01.783 --> 20:03.827
What the hell is that?

20:03.911 --> 20:05.954
Why, it's Lisa Simpson

20:06.038 --> 20:07.456
and look what she's doing.

20:07.539 --> 20:09.041
(crowd gasping)

20:09.124 --> 20:10.626
MAN:
I don't believe it.

20:10.709 --> 20:12.127
She's murdered her brother.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.755
And she's trying to dump
the body in the harbor.

20:14.838 --> 20:15.881
Well, duh.

20:15.964 --> 20:17.925
And as a grim finale,

20:18.008 --> 20:20.928
she intends to drown
that poor caged baby.

20:21.011 --> 20:23.347
What's happening?
Where am I?

20:23.430 --> 20:25.140
And she's on drugs!

20:25.224 --> 20:27.059
Give me the drugs, Lisa.

20:27.142 --> 20:28.936
Dad, I am
not on drugs.

20:29.019 --> 20:29.978
I was just
trying...

20:30.062 --> 20:31.313
Oh, his arm!

20:31.396 --> 20:33.232
Oh, my special little guy.

20:33.315 --> 20:34.441
Are you okay?

20:34.524 --> 20:37.319
Hmm. Dislocated shoulder,

20:37.402 --> 20:38.946
bump on the noggin.

20:39.029 --> 20:40.948
My diagnosis?

20:41.031 --> 20:42.991
A rather nasty fall...

20:43.075 --> 20:45.077
caused by bad baby-sitting!

20:45.160 --> 20:48.038
(crowd gasping)

20:52.501 --> 20:53.794
Hey, Bart.

20:53.877 --> 20:56.213
-How's your arm?
-It's all right.

20:56.296 --> 20:58.298
I was hoping they'd give me
one of them steel claws,

20:58.382 --> 20:59.383
but what are you going to do?

20:59.466 --> 21:01.134
Hmm.

21:01.218 --> 21:05.055
I'm... I'm sorry
I was such a jerk last night.

21:05.138 --> 21:08.308
I guess I sort of ruined
your baby-sitting business.

21:08.392 --> 21:10.519
Yeah, well, that's okay.

21:10.602 --> 21:13.397
I can always sell seeds.

21:13.480 --> 21:15.107
Do you want some seeds?

21:15.190 --> 21:17.651
-No, thanks.
-Oh.

21:17.734 --> 21:18.652
(ringing)

21:18.735 --> 21:19.903
Hello.

21:19.987 --> 21:21.571
World's worst
baby-sitter speaking.

<i>DR. HIBBERT: Lisa,</i>
<i>I'm glad I reached you.</i>

21:23.615 --> 21:25.117
<i>Are you available</i>
<i>to baby-sit tonight?</i>

21:25.200 --> 21:27.119
Aren't you afraid
I might take drugs

21:27.202 --> 21:28.745
and injure your children?

21:28.829 --> 21:30.372
Yes, that is a concern,

21:30.455 --> 21:32.499
but it's so hard
to find a sitter,

21:32.582 --> 21:34.042
and I've got judo tonight.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.919
-(beep)
-Um, okay.

21:36.003 --> 21:37.879
I'm sorry.
Can you hold on, please?

21:37.963 --> 21:39.172

<i>Lisa, Ned Flanders.</i>

21:40.257 --> 21:41.925
<i>You available tonight?</i>

21:42.009 --> 21:43.552
Didn't you hear
I almost killed my brother?

21:43.635 --> 21:45.053
<i>FLANDERS: You did?</i>

21:45.137 --> 21:46.179
<i>Just a minute.</i>
