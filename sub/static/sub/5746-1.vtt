04:38.000 --> 04:39.500
Bliksem

04:45.283 --> 04:47.016
Morning, Bliksem.

05:40.600 --> 05:42.300
Bliksem, help.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.150
Come, the sun's drawing water.

09:34.119 --> 09:35.819
Johan!

09:37.000 --> 09:38.700
Oh, no!

09:42.913 --> 09:44.613
Johan!

09:46.764 --> 09:48.464
I'm coming in.

09:51.485 --> 09:52.876
Kobus.

09:52.877 --> 09:54.377
Katie.

09:54.567 --> 09:56.267
Hello, Kobus.

09:56.666 --> 09:58.678
You know each other.

09:58.679 --> 09:59.982
That's good.

09:59.983 --> 10:02.142
It's very hot today, huh?

10:02.143 --> 10:04.514
My father says it'll never rain.

10:05.485 --> 10:07.884
What happened to Willemien?

10:08.232 --> 10:10.075
Good morning, Kobus.

10:14.316 --> 10:16.281
I work my ass off on this farm

10:16.282 --> 10:17.982
and you...

10:18.128 --> 10:20.694
Kobus! Kobus, man!
Sorry, horsey.

10:21.327 --> 10:22.493
Kobus!

10:22.494 --> 10:24.394
Kobus, man! Wait!

10:25.650 --> 10:27.450
Read it.

10:31.780 --> 10:34.151
It's a bit tough to read with the hangover.

10:34.152 --> 10:35.933
We're going to lose the farm, Johan.

10:35.934 --> 10:37.914
It's from the bank.

10:39.550 --> 10:41.376
You've some inheritance money left...

10:41.377 --> 10:43.977
to hold them off our backs, right?

10:44.429 --> 10:47.010
I bought that bike, remember.

10:48.579 --> 10:51.273
It's my ma, it's my ma!

10:55.163 --> 10:57.799
Sarah, there's more groceries
in the car.

10:57.800 --> 11:00.300
Hello, Ma's big boy.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.192
When did Ma...

11:02.193 --> 11:04.348
Check out my hair!

11:04.998 --> 11:06.912
When did Ma buy that?

11:07.904 --> 11:08.917
Sarah...

11:08.918 --> 11:10.718
Some tea, please.

11:11.640 --> 11:13.074
So you did notice.

11:13.075 --> 11:15.515
I've wanted a chandelier for the lounge...

11:15.516 --> 11:17.967
ever since I married your stingy father.

11:17.968 --> 11:19.521
And speaking of him...

11:19.522 --> 11:22.932
You'll have to play his part
in this year's Vredevlei concert.

11:22.933 --> 11:25.973
We've been bankrupt since dad left us, Ma.

11:27.237 --> 11:28.980
And what will the people say...

11:28.981 --> 11:30.675
of the Willemse family of Brandfort,

11:30.676 --> 11:32.943
if we can't even afford a concert?

11:33.637 --> 11:35.432
Have a koeksister.

11:35.750 --> 11:37.646
Stop over-reacting.

11:42.815 --> 11:44.660
Check this out, Sarah.

11:44.661 --> 11:47.458
I got the prettiest lamp for
the guestroom.

14:01.419 --> 14:04.153
<i>(SPEAKING IN BANTU)</i>

14:58.078 --> 15:00.352
<i>(SPEAKING IN BANTU)</i>

15:30.608 --> 15:33.498
We just need a buyer for the farm, Japie.

15:33.894 --> 15:36.342
Can't we lower the price, just a little bit?

15:36.343 --> 15:38.550
No, Kobus, we can't do that.

15:38.668 --> 15:41.733
People may think there's a
land claim on this place.

15:41.734 --> 15:44.066
Or worse, a big ghost.

15:50.156 --> 15:52.524
Excuse me, that was inappropriate.

15:56.010 --> 15:58.354
You're still having the concert, right?

15:58.355 --> 16:00.447
I don't know anymore, Japie.

16:01.337 --> 16:02.547
Kobus,

16:02.548 --> 16:04.418
if we don't have the concert...

16:04.419 --> 16:06.951
Brandfort will be just another small town.

16:06.975 --> 16:08.575
A pit stop.

16:09.381 --> 16:12.244
Get us a buyer for the farm, please, Japie.

16:38.661 --> 16:41.836
You can't just walk in front
of me like that, woman!

17:07.588 --> 17:10.066
She seems posh, if you ask me.

17:49.372 --> 17:51.654
Did I miss something?

17:55.493 --> 17:59.177
They say British girls are easy, but damn!

18:05.131 --> 18:05.949
What?

18:05.950 --> 18:08.450
When did you last... mmmm?

18:09.624 --> 18:11.524
There you go.

18:16.594 --> 18:18.808
Looks like you're a rent-boy now!

18:18.809 --> 18:20.609
Impressive!

18:30.110 --> 18:33.125
She's English. 
She can carry her own bags.

19:10.789 --> 19:12.943
Pssst... Come look.

19:16.915 --> 19:19.188
Kosie has a girl with him.

19:41.961 --> 19:44.227
She's probably from the city.

19:55.917 --> 19:57.647
What?

20:08.780 --> 20:10.244
Hello, hello, hello...

20:10.245 --> 20:11.351
Please, come inside.

20:11.352 --> 20:13.952
Didn't know you were bringing your 
girlfriend home, Kosie!

20:14.605 --> 20:17.331
She's not my girlfriend, Ma.
She's just lost.

20:17.332 --> 20:21.005
Oh, you're very welcome. 
You can stay as long as you like.

20:37.368 --> 20:39.481
Kosie, bring in the luggage.

20:39.482 --> 20:41.182
Come, Sarah.

22:08.433 --> 22:10.798
Why does that name sound so familiar?

22:14.784 --> 22:17.222
Sarah, prepare a feast!

22:17.226 --> 22:19.550
And roll out a Persian rug!

22:25.110 --> 22:27.129
Put on a blazer and comb your hair.

22:27.130 --> 22:29.104
The Brit dated Prince William!

22:29.105 --> 22:30.455
Agh, nonsense, man!

22:30.456 --> 22:32.379
Yes, his name is William.

22:32.380 --> 22:33.959
And his mom's name is Diana.

22:33.960 --> 22:35.173
Just do as I say.

22:35.174 --> 22:37.007
For heaven's sake...

23:07.452 --> 23:09.841
See, what did I tell you?

23:21.704 --> 23:24.279
Lord, thank you for this food,
bless those who prepared it.

23:24.280 --> 23:26.503
Let us never forget You, Amen.

23:49.844 --> 23:51.816
I don't like her.

24:10.447 --> 24:12.462
She's not that bad.

24:21.148 --> 24:23.179
Sarah, where is the cellphone?

26:36.707 --> 26:40.098
The concert will remind people 
why this farm is so special.

26:40.099 --> 26:42.927
And then it will be easier to sell.

27:35.290 --> 27:36.790
Agh, shame.

29:11.300 --> 29:12.431
Petrus, come!

29:12.432 --> 29:14.032
Jackal!

37:25.933 --> 37:28.108
<i>(SPEAKING IN BANTU)</i>

37:54.991 --> 37:56.007
Agh, no man, Japie!

37:56.008 --> 37:58.640
My husband hasn't even gone 
cold in his grave yet.

37:58.641 --> 38:01.585
Oh yes, he is. He's been cold
for almost a year.

38:04.636 --> 38:06.702
That was inappropriate.

38:07.063 --> 38:09.523
I'm always being inappropriate.

38:11.945 --> 38:14.252
Where are you taking those flowers?

38:14.432 --> 38:16.189
Bring them here.

38:16.390 --> 38:17.786
So I can water them.

38:17.787 --> 38:19.746
Oh, ok.

38:22.302 --> 38:24.338
Well, go away then.

43:13.447 --> 43:16.906
Tell me Kobus, when you sell this place, 
where will you go?

43:17.397 --> 43:19.318
Probably to the city.

43:19.319 --> 43:22.563
There isn't any work in town
for a farmer without a farm.

43:22.564 --> 43:24.792
That's what I thought.

43:27.406 --> 43:30.564
One of my clients seems to be interested.

43:30.610 --> 43:32.824
So, I'll let you know.

43:36.565 --> 43:39.369
"When we stand naked 
in front of each other..."

43:39.370 --> 43:43.540
"my allegiance to my people 
and country perishes..."

43:43.541 --> 43:46.395
"because wars are fought..."

43:46.671 --> 43:49.244
"for moments like these."

43:49.245 --> 43:51.845
"...for moments like these."

44:34.559 --> 44:35.659
All right!

44:36.251 --> 44:37.512
Yeah!

44:37.513 --> 44:39.013
Feel it, ok?

44:39.548 --> 44:40.722
Yeah!

44:40.723 --> 44:42.942
Stretch it, stretch it!

44:42.943 --> 44:45.244
Feel it!

44:45.245 --> 44:46.137
Can you feel it?

44:46.138 --> 44:46.943
I do.

44:46.944 --> 44:48.644
It feels good, right?

44:50.204 --> 44:52.192
You can feel him, right?

47:18.816 --> 47:22.709
I told them a movie is being
made about this farm.

47:28.834 --> 47:31.086
They're clearly impressed.

47:35.233 --> 47:38.663
Please don't tell anyone, 
while I'm thinking this through.

47:39.360 --> 47:41.360
Of course not.

49:56.757 --> 49:58.657
Did it hurt?

50:54.100 --> 51:00.299

53:12.207 --> 53:15.568
"When we stand naked

53:18.302 --> 53:21.481
"my allegiance to my people

53:22.693 --> 53:24.193
"because..."

54:00.820 --> 54:04.453
"because wars are fought for
moments like these."

54:31.258 --> 54:33.368
Did you have something to do with this?

54:33.830 --> 54:35.464
Agh, I only planted the seed, man.

54:35.465 --> 54:37.058
How the tree grows has nothing to do with me.

54:37.059 --> 54:38.507
Is everything always a joke to you?

54:38.508 --> 54:41.034
He did it because he cares about you.

54:43.670 --> 54:46.591
He said I had to make the girl a little jealous.

54:46.845 --> 54:50.208
Why? Why would you want to
help me with another woman?

54:52.521 --> 54:54.969
Because I want you to be happy.

54:54.970 --> 54:57.156
I've always wanted that.

54:57.315 --> 54:59.988
So that's why you left me
at the altar, right?

55:00.792 --> 55:02.492
Yes.

55:03.698 --> 55:06.215
You didn't make me happy.

55:08.579 --> 55:11.904
And I didn't make you happy either, Kobus.

55:12.649 --> 55:14.970
Not really, and you know that.

55:16.643 --> 55:18.343
Little brother...

55:18.393 --> 55:20.825
It is time to open up.

55:20.826 --> 55:23.425
Or you will lose that chick forever.

01:03:13.781 --> 01:03:15.661
Who knows anything about Twitter?

01:03:15.662 --> 01:03:17.313
I have to tweet.

01:03:17.314 --> 01:03:19.817
Do they still shoot films on
"cellulite"?

01:03:20.351 --> 01:03:22.151
Ma, let it go.

01:07:29.334 --> 01:07:31.391
We have to vote on something.

01:07:32.984 --> 01:07:35.899
Japie got us a buyer for the farm.

01:07:37.835 --> 01:07:40.899
It's a good price, 
it will get us back on our feet.

01:07:41.523 --> 01:07:43.853
Or we can keep the farm.

01:07:44.688 --> 01:07:46.888
Let's keep it then!

01:07:47.566 --> 01:07:51.081
If we want to keep the farm,
we'll have to sell everything on it.

01:07:51.218 --> 01:07:54.834
And if the harvest fails again,
we will lose everything.

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:38.700
Drive carefully.

01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:44.720
We'll help you.

01:15:44.935 --> 01:15:47.473
You sang lovely tonight, Sarah.

01:16:23.092 --> 01:16:26.250
Couldn't they have left the fridge?

01:16:33.732 --> 01:16:34.896
No!

01:16:34.897 --> 01:16:36.424
No, no!

01:16:36.805 --> 01:16:39.353
You can come eat at my place.

01:16:41.222 --> 01:16:42.216
Come.

01:16:42.217 --> 01:16:44.117
My house isn't far.

01:16:44.118 --> 01:16:46.426
It's just around the corner.

01:17:18.593 --> 01:17:19.997
Uh Uh umh...

01:17:19.998 --> 01:17:23.191
I know it's probably inappropriate, my Muggie.

01:17:23.192 --> 01:17:25.792
But I have a fridge at my house.

01:17:26.018 --> 01:17:29.466
And furniture... in your favourite colours.

01:17:30.351 --> 01:17:31.951
And... uh...

01:17:33.877 --> 01:17:36.105
a king size double bed.

01:17:36.830 --> 01:17:39.610
What are trying to say, Japie.

01:17:39.962 --> 01:17:44.048
I've been walking around with
this in my pocket for a week.

01:17:44.499 --> 01:17:47.976
Japie, this is totally inappropriate.

01:18:00.293 --> 01:18:02.084
Come here.

01:18:02.085 --> 01:18:04.941
Come, come. Come, come.

01:18:09.518 --> 01:18:11.691
Give it here, so I can see.

01:18:11.763 --> 01:18:13.483
That was wonderful!

01:18:13.484 --> 01:18:14.984
Ah!

01:18:15.127 --> 01:18:16.948
There you go!

01:18:16.949 --> 01:18:18.924
Let's celebrate!

01:19:23.999 --> 01:19:27.348
Can someone please tell me
what's going on?

01:19:27.349 --> 01:19:28.944
Kobus and Jodie, Ma.

01:19:28.945 --> 01:19:30.745
Isn't it obvious?

01:19:30.813 --> 01:19:32.513
Oh, I see.

01:19:32.605 --> 01:19:35.411
Well, are you just gonna watch
as she flies away?

01:19:36.889 --> 01:19:39.010
She's with Daniel Taylor, Ma.

01:19:39.011 --> 01:19:42.162
Well, I'm not quite sure who he is.

01:19:42.163 --> 01:19:45.744
We looked him up when I
googled "lactose intolerant".

01:19:45.745 --> 01:19:46.984
But...

01:19:46.985 --> 01:19:49.654
She belongs in a big city, like London.

01:19:54.607 --> 01:19:56.207
There you go.

01:19:56.568 --> 01:19:58.339
Do you want her to go?

01:19:58.340 --> 01:20:01.004
Because you can learn something
from bloody Japie, then.

01:20:01.005 --> 01:20:04.898
Because he does what he wants,
no matter how inappropriate it is.

01:20:06.675 --> 01:20:08.475
Kobus...

01:20:11.808 --> 01:20:14.114
Come, come, everyone.

01:23:44.075 --> 01:23:45.324
Kobus...

01:23:45.325 --> 01:23:46.338
Kobus...

01:23:46.339 --> 01:23:47.939
Come look at this!

01:29:37.940 --> 01:29:40.561
