00:16.516 --> 00:18.268
Can I really go?

00:18.393 --> 00:20.228
Your parents may feel uncomfortable.

00:20.353 --> 00:22.689
No, when I told them you were coming,
they were really happy.

00:22.814 --> 00:24.315
Really? Were they really happy?

00:24.441 --> 00:25.817
Yes, they were.

00:27.193 --> 00:28.737
Okay.

00:28.862 --> 00:31.281
Please, give us your blessing.

00:31.406 --> 00:33.700
How dare you tempt my son?

00:35.452 --> 00:37.746
That should be enough.
Break it off with him.

00:37.871 --> 00:40.290
- Mother!
- Why are you calling me Mother?

00:41.166 --> 00:42.333
Ae-bong's here.

00:42.917 --> 00:43.877
Hello.

00:44.002 --> 00:46.755
Hello, Ae-bong.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.173
Glad to see you.

00:48.298 --> 00:50.300
Sorry, I couldn't bring anything.
He just asked me to come.

00:50.425 --> 00:52.802
That's okay.

00:52.927 --> 00:55.638
Ae-bong? You're Seok's girlfriend?

00:55.764 --> 00:56.931
Hello.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.736
How dare you date my son?

01:09.861 --> 01:10.737
Excuse me?

01:11.946 --> 01:15.742
I'll be generous.
That should be enough.

01:24.959 --> 01:28.463
Am I generous or what?
That's a really yummy snack!

01:30.423 --> 01:33.092
He's imitating the TV shows.
Don't worry. Sorry.

01:33.218 --> 01:34.719
Welcome, Ae-bong!

01:34.844 --> 01:37.555
BUCKET LIST

01:45.146 --> 01:48.108
Honey, are you okay?
Are you okay?

01:51.569 --> 01:54.489
This saved my life.

01:55.490 --> 01:57.700
Oh, my God!
You're my goddess of fortune.

01:59.202 --> 02:02.497
Do you really want a divorce?

02:02.622 --> 02:05.708
Mom, if you react, he'll never stop.
Just ignore him.

02:05.834 --> 02:09.003
- You, too, Ae-bong.
- Ae-bong, I'm funny, huh?

02:09.129 --> 02:11.840
Am I funny or what?

02:11.965 --> 02:13.383
I'm so funny!

02:15.301 --> 02:17.887
Ae-bong, would you like noodles or rice?

02:18.012 --> 02:20.765
- Noodles, please.
- Okay.

02:20.890 --> 02:23.560
Honey, I'll have the usual.

02:24.060 --> 02:27.313
Grow up, you pathetic moron!

02:27.438 --> 02:29.774
Shut up, and eat what's on the table.

02:29.899 --> 02:33.153
Eat whatever I give you!
That's the usual. Are you happy now?

02:39.701 --> 02:44.080
Wait! Since everyone is here,
I must tell you this.

02:47.083 --> 02:52.088
Actually,
I didn't give birth to you, Seok.

02:54.799 --> 02:56.217
It was your mother who gave birth to you.

02:57.844 --> 02:59.804
Surprise, surprise!
Wasn't that a good one?

02:59.929 --> 03:01.931
- Ae-bong, isn't that a good joke?
- Yes.

03:02.056 --> 03:04.893
Ae-bong, enjoy your food.
What a surprise!

03:09.647 --> 03:12.525
- Hi, I'm Jira.
- I'm Jira.

03:15.945 --> 03:19.490
Hey, honey!

03:21.367 --> 03:22.243
Seok!

03:24.162 --> 03:25.747
Ae-bong!

03:25.872 --> 03:28.333
- Ae-bong!
- Don't bother. It's nothing.

03:28.458 --> 03:31.085
It's just some noise.

03:33.755 --> 03:36.633
I see. You're ignoring me.

03:36.758 --> 03:41.054
Okay, I'll see
if you can keep ignoring me.

03:51.564 --> 03:55.235
Great. I've always wanted to do this.

03:58.196 --> 04:01.199
Seok, bring me a glass of water.

04:01.324 --> 04:03.326
Water, give me water.

04:03.451 --> 04:06.746
Go get it yourself!

04:06.871 --> 04:12.252
- Water, give me water!
- What's this?

04:12.377 --> 04:15.672
- Honey, scratch my back.
- Shut up!

04:15.797 --> 04:20.176
- Scratch my back!
- What the hell are you doing?

04:20.927 --> 04:25.390
- Huh?
- Water, water!

04:25.515 --> 04:29.143
Scratch my back, back, back.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.813
Water, back, water, back.

04:31.938 --> 04:34.274
Water, back, water.

04:39.320 --> 04:41.990
Not that. Give me iced water.

04:42.115 --> 04:45.743
Oh, that feels great.

04:48.663 --> 04:49.956
Bring me the newspaper.

04:50.081 --> 04:52.083
If you don't,
I'll tell your girlfriend, Ae-bong

04:52.208 --> 04:54.419
that you have a bad case of hemorrhoids.

04:54.544 --> 04:55.920
Ae-bong will find out

04:56.045 --> 04:58.589
you're not circumcised yet.

04:58.715 --> 04:59.882
The newspaper, newspaper.

05:00.008 --> 05:01.968
The newspaper, newspaper.

05:02.093 --> 05:03.845
- Seok, bring me the newspaper.
- Oh, no!

05:03.970 --> 05:05.972
Seok, bring me the newspaper.

05:09.892 --> 05:11.311
Stop it, now.

05:17.525 --> 05:18.818
Not yet.

05:19.444 --> 05:23.323
Ring-Ding-Dong, Ring-Ding-Dong.

05:23.448 --> 05:26.409
- Ring-Ding-Dong.
- To my girlfriend.

05:26.534 --> 05:30.538
- Ring-Ding-Dong...
- Ring Ding Dong.

05:30.663 --> 05:32.582
TO MY GIRLFRIEND,
RING DING DONG.

05:37.712 --> 05:39.630
You must be really crazy!

05:40.798 --> 05:42.341
- Stop it!
- Stop it, now!

05:44.677 --> 05:47.055
You're here at last!
Turn off the light.

06:11.913 --> 06:14.082
Can't take it anymore.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.292
We have to throw these evil
speakers away!

06:16.417 --> 06:18.252
FREE

06:21.089 --> 06:22.965
What are these?

06:23.841 --> 06:26.511
Oh, they're brand new! Wow, nice!

06:28.429 --> 06:30.723
Oh, they're nice.

06:46.572 --> 06:49.951
Seok, bring me water!
Water, water.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.327
Water!

06:52.078 --> 06:55.206
Where are my speakers?

06:59.460 --> 07:01.212
Where are my speakers?

07:01.671 --> 07:04.298
Stop it.
I won't ignore you anymore.

07:04.423 --> 07:06.134
Stop it, Dad.
I won't ignore you from now on.

07:06.551 --> 07:09.345
I cooked fish stew for you.
Come, quick.

07:09.470 --> 07:12.181
Do you mean it?
You're not going to ignore me?

07:12.306 --> 07:14.434
- Of course not.
- No, never.

07:15.226 --> 07:16.602
Oh, I love that fish stew.

07:17.979 --> 07:20.189
Oh, I love this fish stew.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.485
Oh, yummy!

07:24.610 --> 07:26.362
Done.

07:26.487 --> 07:29.949
Turn off the computer speakers.

07:30.074 --> 07:31.367
Is this connected?

07:31.492 --> 07:32.618
Good. Let's see a movie.

07:36.414 --> 07:37.874
Oh, it's connected.

07:42.462 --> 07:46.424
This Bluetooth speaker sounds great!

07:49.844 --> 07:55.349
Oh, it tastes different.
Tastes great!

08:04.275 --> 08:07.487
Hey, look at this electric bill!
Why is it so high?

08:07.612 --> 08:11.782
Hey, look at this electric bill!
Why is it so high?

08:11.908 --> 08:17.163
You must save energy.
Money is hard to earn, you know.

08:19.957 --> 08:21.459
What the hell?

08:26.464 --> 08:28.007
A bedroom scene.

08:36.307 --> 08:39.727
Your posture is important,
not the number of times you do it.

08:41.938 --> 08:45.024
I can do it. Three more times.

08:45.149 --> 08:46.442
Is three more times enough?

08:46.567 --> 08:49.529
The guy next door does ten
every time.

08:49.654 --> 08:53.366
Ten times? Wow!

08:53.491 --> 08:58.037
- Is it hard?
- What's that for? You're not using it.

08:58.162 --> 09:00.748
Since you mentioned it,
shall I use this now?

09:00.873 --> 09:03.793
Oh, you silly!

09:03.918 --> 09:06.128
Say you like it, if you like it.

09:08.464 --> 09:11.801
Someone can hear us from outside!

09:11.926 --> 09:13.719
Stop it!

09:13.844 --> 09:15.054
Stop touching!

09:15.179 --> 09:18.558
You crazy bastard, cheating on me again!

09:22.311 --> 09:23.854
Where did you hide that bitch, huh?

09:23.980 --> 09:25.856
Come out, right now!

09:25.982 --> 09:27.692
- Did she run away?
- Oh, what do you mean?

09:27.817 --> 09:32.405
- How many times?
- No, you're wrong!

09:33.906 --> 09:36.742
Traditional music is nice for the baby.

09:38.536 --> 09:41.539
Baby, listen to the nice song.

09:42.832 --> 09:47.670
Who's your mother?
How could she raise you like this?

09:50.715 --> 09:51.841
Who's your mother?

09:51.966 --> 09:55.052
How could she raise you like this?

09:55.761 --> 10:00.516
Who's your mother?
How could she raise you like this?

10:00.641 --> 10:03.269
Honey, the baby is kicking!

10:03.394 --> 10:06.272
He likes this song!

10:06.397 --> 10:10.067
I was born like a lonely stone.

10:10.192 --> 10:15.448
My poor mother,
why did you give birth to me?

10:17.491 --> 10:20.202
- Hello.
- It's me, Dad.

10:20.328 --> 10:23.080
- Yeah?
- It's me, Dad.

10:23.205 --> 10:25.207
- Are you deaf?
- Yes, I ate.

10:26.042 --> 10:29.920
Minjun, do you like Mama or Daddy?

10:30.046 --> 10:32.381
Dad.

10:32.506 --> 10:33.466
Dad.

10:33.591 --> 10:35.176
Are you deaf?

10:36.677 --> 10:41.849
- What? I'm in a coffee shop. It's noisy.
- Aren't you coming?

10:41.974 --> 10:44.477
What are you doing there?
Aren't you coming?

10:44.602 --> 10:49.398
Honey, I'm too scared to go near him.
Come home right away.

10:49.523 --> 10:51.942
Come, quick! Aren't you coming?

10:55.112 --> 10:58.532
God, please say something to me.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.452
I'll do as you say.

11:01.577 --> 11:02.578
Yeah, it's me.

11:05.873 --> 11:08.417
- Hi, Cheol-wang.
- I've been busy.

11:08.542 --> 11:12.254
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

11:12.380 --> 11:14.673
Can I borrow some money?

11:19.011 --> 11:21.180
Money? I have no money.

11:21.305 --> 11:22.765
I say you do have money.

11:26.435 --> 11:29.271
You cheap ass!
Why? Don't you want to give it to me?

11:29.397 --> 11:33.150
Oh, no, no!

11:33.275 --> 11:34.693
- And...
- Yeah!

11:34.819 --> 11:36.737
Let's have a drink when you're free.

11:36.862 --> 11:39.407
- What?
- Don't you want to?

11:39.532 --> 11:41.826
No, that sounds good.

11:41.951 --> 11:44.453
I'll come to you. See you tomorrow.

11:44.578 --> 11:46.414
Tomorrow?

11:46.539 --> 11:49.125
I'll come to you.

11:49.250 --> 11:54.296
Oh, no!
Can I have some more time?

11:54.422 --> 11:56.424
I'll come to you tomorrow.

11:56.549 --> 12:01.720
NOISY NEIGHBORS

12:05.599 --> 12:09.728
Oh, the neighbors are having big problems.

12:09.854 --> 12:13.983
- What problems?
- The couple upstairs want a divorce.

12:14.108 --> 12:15.234
- A divorce?
- Yeah.

12:15.359 --> 12:18.737
The wife saw her husband
had brought a woman into their home,

12:18.863 --> 12:21.282
but he insists he never did.

12:21.407 --> 12:24.869
I didn't do anything wrong!
I don't deserve this!

12:24.994 --> 12:26.996
You animal!

12:27.121 --> 12:30.124
And you know No. 304, right?
The couple with a baby.

12:30.249 --> 12:33.752
The baby is possessed by an evil spirit.

12:33.878 --> 12:34.753
An evil spirit?

12:38.424 --> 12:39.550
I'm so scared!

12:40.843 --> 12:44.972
And the lady in No. 501 has gone crazy.

12:45.097 --> 12:46.765
She says she'll die soon.

12:46.891 --> 12:49.977
- Someone's coming to get her.
- Oh.

12:51.437 --> 12:53.481
Don't come, please don't.

12:53.606 --> 12:56.275
I don't want to die.

12:59.403 --> 13:01.363
We're the only normal family.

13:01.489 --> 13:05.034
- That's what I mean.
- Huh?

13:05.159 --> 13:10.039
- This place is cursed.
- Oh, no.

13:15.044 --> 13:18.756
In fact, she's your half-sister.

13:24.178 --> 13:25.262
Boss, she's my friend.

13:25.387 --> 13:29.099
- Whose phone is it? Pick it up!
- Not mine.

13:29.225 --> 13:30.976
I can't hear the TV. Turn it off.

13:33.145 --> 13:34.021
Not mine, either.

13:35.397 --> 13:37.316
Where is that sound coming from?

13:39.068 --> 13:41.529
- That can't be--
- Hello?

13:42.404 --> 13:44.990
Hi, honey!

13:46.700 --> 13:48.786
Oh, it's from next door.

13:48.911 --> 13:50.913
She has no manners.

13:51.038 --> 13:52.414
Come and get me!

13:52.540 --> 13:55.042
No soundproofing at all!

13:55.167 --> 13:57.378
Let's go over the multiplication table.

13:57.503 --> 13:59.296
- Three multiplied by six?
- 18!

14:03.259 --> 14:05.511
- Two multiplied by eight?
- 19?

14:05.636 --> 14:07.471
It's 14, you idiot!

14:07.596 --> 14:09.306
It's 16, you moron!

14:09.932 --> 14:11.976
Just like your father.

14:12.685 --> 14:13.727
Why do you blame me?

14:15.896 --> 14:19.942
I can't take it anymore.
I want to say something.

14:24.154 --> 14:27.575
THE NOISE

14:32.454 --> 14:34.874
- Who is it?
- I live in No. 204.

14:37.543 --> 14:40.337
- What do you want?
- I'm sorry, but you're too noisy.

14:40.462 --> 14:42.715
- We hear everything.
- Excuse me?

14:42.840 --> 14:45.259
We hear nothing.

14:50.598 --> 14:52.683
Let's see if you still hear nothing.

14:52.808 --> 14:54.685
Noise? What noise?

14:54.810 --> 14:57.855
What should I do? Be quiet all the time?

14:57.980 --> 15:00.733
Honey, the guy from next door said
we're too noisy.

15:00.858 --> 15:02.359
What did he say?

15:02.484 --> 15:04.194
He said we're making noise.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.905
He's so annoying!

15:06.030 --> 15:08.741
We're educated people.
We shouldn't lose our cool.

15:08.866 --> 15:10.868
Oh, you're such a gentleman.

15:10.993 --> 15:13.579
Shall we make more noise tonight?

15:13.704 --> 15:15.664
I need to go to the bathroom.

15:43.067 --> 15:44.193
Honey, do you want to take a shower
together?

15:46.528 --> 15:49.698
Honey, it's not me. It's not me!

15:49.823 --> 15:53.077
I'm not-- try to smell it.

15:53.202 --> 15:55.287
Honey, I was doing number one.
Wait a second!

15:55.412 --> 15:58.499
Honey, it's not me!

16:00.501 --> 16:02.962
Honey!

16:03.087 --> 16:05.589
I saw the next-door neighbor with a girl
at a nightclub last night.

16:05.714 --> 16:09.677
What? Was he there?
Did they look close?

16:09.802 --> 16:13.347
The neighbors may hear.
I can't talk now.

16:13.472 --> 16:16.809
He said he had no girlfriend,
but he's a married man, right?

16:16.934 --> 16:18.519
- I think so.
- I didn't.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.437
- I was at work.
- In America.

16:20.562 --> 16:22.314
- Really?
- No!

16:22.439 --> 16:24.566
I was at work last night,
not at a nightclub.

16:26.360 --> 16:28.988
You stop lying!

16:29.113 --> 16:33.534
Oh, it was so hot!
My face turned red!

16:33.659 --> 16:34.910
I wasn't there!

16:35.035 --> 16:37.454
- He said you were!
- No, I wasn't!

16:37.579 --> 16:39.665
- I was at the entrance, but--
- I am going crazy!

16:39.790 --> 16:41.917
Did he see me? Who is he?

16:42.042 --> 16:44.336
You went there! I'm sure!

16:46.839 --> 16:49.925
It's quiet now.

16:55.305 --> 17:01.311
I miss you

17:02.563 --> 17:07.317
He can't stay quiet for five minutes.

17:07.443 --> 17:13.824
I'm lonely

17:13.949 --> 17:15.200
I loved--

17:18.454 --> 17:21.290
Oh, don't stop there.

17:22.541 --> 17:24.752
You blabbed about the nightclub.

17:25.335 --> 17:27.296
It's payback time.

17:28.005 --> 17:32.051
Shall I pretend I don't know it?

17:32.176 --> 17:35.846
Shall I talk about something else?

17:35.971 --> 17:40.309
Shall I kiss him to shut his mouth?

17:40.434 --> 17:42.061
One, two, the tears--

17:44.104 --> 17:45.272
- Agh, shit!
- What is it?

17:45.397 --> 17:46.607
That cruel guy!

17:46.732 --> 17:48.442
- What's the matter?
- He stopped at the best part.

17:52.488 --> 17:55.866
Okay, I'll show you who I am.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.410
The more I see you,
the more I fall in love with you

17:58.535 --> 18:00.662
It's like a dream
We're together

18:00.788 --> 18:03.290
We need not talk

18:03.415 --> 18:05.209
We need not decide where to go

18:05.334 --> 18:07.461
We'll leave the hectic world behind

18:07.586 --> 18:09.713
- You and me
- No!

18:09.838 --> 18:13.467
Wait, not yet.
Wait a second.

18:13.592 --> 18:14.802
You said you wouldn't see me again

18:14.927 --> 18:16.970
But now, we're in this car alone

18:17.096 --> 18:19.056
We passed the hill

18:19.181 --> 18:21.308
Rain, wind, the world and people

18:21.433 --> 18:22.810
Please don't stop us
We're now running fast

18:23.310 --> 18:24.436
Seok!

18:24.561 --> 18:26.313
We're escaping the world
that separated us

18:31.360 --> 18:32.486
- We're--
- Right now!

18:32.611 --> 18:33.695
So fast

18:33.821 --> 18:37.908
Together, we're riding in the car

18:38.033 --> 18:41.662
We're looking at the same direction

18:41.787 --> 18:45.999
We're going to the same place

18:46.125 --> 18:49.837
That must be heaven

18:49.962 --> 18:54.466
- Oh, my
- Oh

18:55.384 --> 18:58.011
Yeah, the chorus!

18:59.012 --> 19:02.349
Oh, you!

19:02.850 --> 19:04.309
Did you just steal my chorus part?

19:04.434 --> 19:05.936
Hey, No. 205!

19:06.061 --> 19:07.688
You picked a fight with the wrong guys!

19:07.813 --> 19:09.565
Ah, ah!

19:09.690 --> 19:12.943
We started it with songs,
we'll end it with songs.

19:15.654 --> 19:17.698
We'll see.

19:21.285 --> 19:23.036
TONIGHT AT 9:00
NEVER-ENDING STORY

19:23.912 --> 19:24.997
CALL

19:53.108 --> 19:57.654
Somewhere I can't reach

19:58.822 --> 20:00.032
- What's that?
- Cool!

20:00.157 --> 20:01.992
- What are they doing?
- What's that?

20:02.117 --> 20:06.496
You're there

20:08.790 --> 20:12.127
But in the little chair
I was sitting with you

20:12.252 --> 20:13.629
- Hey, Dong-yeop.
- Yeah.

20:13.754 --> 20:17.799
- Let's have another round at my place.
- Yeah, that's great.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.844
- What are they doing?
- What is that?

20:21.345 --> 20:22.346
Wait.

20:24.181 --> 20:27.684
You left

20:27.809 --> 20:30.604
Like you left me

20:30.729 --> 20:32.231
- What is he doing?
- He must be a singer.

20:32.356 --> 20:33.649
What is he doing?

20:33.774 --> 20:36.360
Waving your hand

20:36.485 --> 20:37.778
Someday

20:37.903 --> 20:43.742
That will be kept as a memory

20:48.497 --> 20:54.753
If we miss each other, we'd meet someday

20:54.878 --> 20:59.258
Like in a movie

20:59.383 --> 21:03.428
We'll meet again

21:03.553 --> 21:06.974
It was so hard for you

21:07.099 --> 21:11.103
But I couldn't do anything for you

21:11.228 --> 21:15.274
Those beautiful days

21:15.399 --> 21:21.613
And you

21:23.073 --> 21:24.616
Wow, good!

21:25.575 --> 21:28.245
Wow, it's like  "The Oldies but Goodies."

21:28.370 --> 21:30.497
- Yes, it is.
- It's great.

21:30.622 --> 21:32.165
It sounds just like that.

21:36.878 --> 21:38.547
The Oldies but Goodies,
the legendary songs.

21:38.672 --> 21:43.010
We heard the legendary rock group
Buhwal's songs.

21:43.135 --> 21:46.638
Who's going to be the champion?

21:46.763 --> 21:49.349
Mr. Tae-won Kim, what do you think?

21:49.474 --> 21:52.853
Koreans are the best singers on earth.

21:54.021 --> 21:56.857
All Koreans are singers.
I'm deeply touched.

21:56.982 --> 22:02.779
Yeah, it's No, 204 vs. No. 205.

22:02.904 --> 22:05.824
Will No. 204 be the winner?

22:05.949 --> 22:10.871
Or will it No. 205?

22:10.996 --> 22:14.499
Please, show me the result!

22:14.624 --> 22:16.168
Show me now!

22:33.310 --> 22:34.227
The result is...

22:44.488 --> 22:46.490
- Wow!
- No. 205!

22:46.615 --> 22:50.285
- Wow!
- Yes!

22:52.079 --> 22:53.413
Good job!

22:58.126 --> 23:01.713
You lose when you are nervous.
You win when you are excited.

23:01.838 --> 23:04.257
No. 205 showed excitement.

23:04.382 --> 23:06.343
So I already knew.

23:06.468 --> 23:07.969
We can't end it like this.

23:08.095 --> 23:10.847
Family pride is at stake.

23:12.224 --> 23:13.725
Right. We have her.

23:13.850 --> 23:17.270
The lady upstairs will bring us victory.

23:17.395 --> 23:19.439
I'll be right back.

23:23.568 --> 23:25.862
Yes, you're all dead.

23:27.072 --> 23:28.615
Let's go now.

23:32.786 --> 23:33.912
- What shall I
- Who's that?

23:36.540 --> 23:37.833
Wow, Jeong-hyeon Park!

23:37.958 --> 23:39.960
- Is she Jeong-hyeon Park?
- Jeong-hyeon Park.

23:41.211 --> 23:46.883
My heart fluttered

23:47.008 --> 23:49.719
I had to go

23:49.845 --> 23:52.681
Dong-yeop, where are you?
I brought some booze!

23:54.683 --> 23:57.686
Oh, isn't she Jeong-hyeon Park?

23:58.562 --> 24:05.152
I know this is a dream

24:05.277 --> 24:08.280
Right now, I will

24:09.614 --> 24:11.158
What is this?

24:12.826 --> 24:14.244
Forever

24:14.369 --> 24:15.996
Oh, this is great!

24:16.121 --> 24:17.956
- Is she Jeong-hyeon Park?
- Right.

24:18.081 --> 24:20.458
You're turning around

24:20.876 --> 24:22.460
Isn't she?

24:22.586 --> 24:24.004
- She is.
- What the hell?

24:25.589 --> 24:27.507
We walk together

24:28.383 --> 24:29.968
Again

24:30.093 --> 24:32.345
I will be alone

24:32.470 --> 24:35.307
You've gone over there

24:35.432 --> 24:36.558
Oh?

24:36.683 --> 24:38.935
- Oh.
- The left one.

24:39.060 --> 24:40.562
- She's here.
- I'm sure.

24:40.687 --> 24:42.022
Oh, it's confusing.

24:42.147 --> 24:46.568
I don't want to let you go

24:46.693 --> 24:48.987
I can't see you

25:01.374 --> 25:03.418
She could be either here or there.

25:03.543 --> 25:04.711
She's here.

25:04.836 --> 25:06.463
- Good.
- She's great.

25:06.588 --> 25:08.423
She's Jeong-hyeon Park!

25:09.466 --> 25:11.551
Is this The Hidden Singer?

25:11.676 --> 25:15.639
- Yes, it is.
- Right.

25:15.764 --> 25:18.475
- That's not her.
- Wonderful!

25:21.937 --> 25:23.730
It's The Hidden Singer.

25:23.855 --> 25:25.732
Yes, it is.

25:25.857 --> 25:27.609
Two singers are in room No. 1.
and room No. 2.

25:27.734 --> 25:30.195
Which one is Jeong-hyeon Park?

25:30.320 --> 25:32.447
Please line up in front of the room

25:32.572 --> 25:34.449
you believe
Jeong-hyeon Park is in.

25:34.574 --> 25:36.159
One, two, three.

25:36.284 --> 25:37.410
- No. 1.
- No. 2.

25:37.535 --> 25:39.204
Between No. 1 and No. 2,

25:39.329 --> 25:42.332
where would Jeong-hyeon Park be?

25:42.457 --> 25:44.000
- No. 1?
- Yes, No. 1.

25:44.125 --> 25:45.085
- No. 2?
- Yes, No. 2.

25:45.210 --> 25:47.045
More people lined up in front of No. 2.

25:47.170 --> 25:50.465
Would Jeong-hyeon Park be in No. 2?

25:50.590 --> 25:52.550
Let's reveal who is there.

25:52.968 --> 25:54.302
Lady in room No. 2,

25:54.427 --> 25:57.347
please, open the curtain
and show your face.

25:58.098 --> 25:59.182
Show us!

26:01.643 --> 26:02.560
Now!

26:13.822 --> 26:15.949
- I told you so!
- What the--

26:17.200 --> 26:19.327
She's the reporter, Seul-gi Park.

26:19.744 --> 26:20.620
Oh, we won!

26:20.745 --> 26:23.581
- We won, sorry!
- She tricked us.

26:23.707 --> 26:25.083
We've been tricked like this
for years.

26:25.208 --> 26:28.420
Then, would she be in room No. 1?

26:28.545 --> 26:32.048
Please, open the curtain in room No. 1,
and show your face.

26:32.173 --> 26:33.633
Show us now!

26:41.516 --> 26:42.475
What the hell?

26:42.600 --> 26:43.810
Who is she?

26:43.935 --> 26:47.355
- What's going on?
- What is this?

26:47.480 --> 26:48.857
She's wearing a mask.

26:48.982 --> 26:50.066
Let's go.

26:50.191 --> 26:51.443
- What is this?
- I knew it!

26:51.568 --> 26:54.070
Why would Jeong-hyeon Park come here?

26:54.195 --> 26:55.613
Tae-won, let's go and have a drink.

26:55.739 --> 26:56.990
I'm so disappointed. I need a drink.

26:57.407 --> 26:59.075
This isn't even my show.

27:00.243 --> 27:01.328
Shit!

27:05.415 --> 27:08.001
Thanks, it was fun.

27:08.126 --> 27:10.295
- Yeah, thanks.
- Thank you.

27:10.420 --> 27:14.841
You said I'd get paid on the job.

27:14.966 --> 27:17.802
- Oh, yes.
- Yeah.

27:18.595 --> 27:21.431
You didn't tell my agency, right?

27:21.556 --> 27:22.891
I needed quick money.

27:23.016 --> 27:25.268
I'm not sharing this with my agency.
This is all mine.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.105
Bye, thanks.

27:29.230 --> 27:32.233
- Bye.
- Bye.

27:34.778 --> 27:38.865
- Wait, is she real or--?
- Oh.

27:38.990 --> 27:41.076
Loser, loner

27:41.201 --> 27:43.119
Bullshitting coward

27:43.244 --> 27:45.163
Pathetic loser

27:45.288 --> 27:46.623
It's you in a mirror

27:46.748 --> 27:48.792
I'm a loser, a loner

27:48.917 --> 27:51.127
Bullshitting coward

27:51.252 --> 27:53.213
Useless trash

28:08.770 --> 28:11.231
Oh, no! I can't take it anymore.

28:14.275 --> 28:16.444
Not now. Wait.

28:16.569 --> 28:18.446
You have to remain calm.

28:19.280 --> 28:21.491
Admit you're defeated.

28:21.616 --> 28:22.575
Admit it.

28:32.627 --> 28:37.882
BE CONSIDERATE OF YOUR NEIGHBORS

28:42.429 --> 28:44.806
A FEW MONTHS LATER

28:44.931 --> 28:47.183
No. 205 moved out.

28:48.143 --> 28:51.688
At last, we're free.

28:52.272 --> 28:54.858
Welcome! Welcome!

28:55.942 --> 28:56.901
Do you live here?

28:57.026 --> 28:58.778
Two, three!
Fell in love with you!

28:58.903 --> 29:00.905
Hello, we're La Boum.

29:01.030 --> 29:03.867
We're brothers.

29:03.992 --> 29:05.160
Hi!

29:05.285 --> 29:06.369
We're moving in today.

29:07.120 --> 29:10.248
- You mean, into No. 205?
- Yeah, right.

29:10.373 --> 29:13.585
- We live in No. 204.
- Hello, neighbor.

29:13.710 --> 29:15.170
- Oh, hi!
- Oh, my gosh!

29:15.295 --> 29:16.463
It's cold. You should get in!

29:16.588 --> 29:17.964
Yeah, before you catch a cold.

29:18.089 --> 29:19.382
- See you later.
- Thanks.

29:19.507 --> 29:21.760
See you.

29:22.886 --> 29:25.597
Where are you going?
We were going home.

29:25.722 --> 29:27.348
What's wrong with you?

29:28.266 --> 29:30.769
We can share this room.

29:30.894 --> 29:33.271
Who's taking a shower first?

29:33.396 --> 29:35.815
- Me!
- How about "Rock-Paper-Scissors"?

29:35.940 --> 29:38.109
- Rock-paper-scissors!
- Rock-paper-scissors!

29:38.234 --> 29:39.152
- Ahh.
- Oh, yeah!

29:41.029 --> 29:44.199
The guys next door look like
a potato and a cucumber!

29:44.324 --> 29:47.786
- Oh.
- That was so funny.

29:47.911 --> 29:50.663
Who has some cigarettes?

29:50.789 --> 29:52.749
- I do.
- You have cigarettes?

29:52.874 --> 29:55.293
Do you have a lighter?
Who has one?

29:55.418 --> 29:56.795
I have one.

29:56.920 --> 29:58.463
Let's go out to the veranda.

29:58.880 --> 30:00.465
Take a deep breath

30:00.590 --> 30:02.801
And without knowing

30:02.926 --> 30:06.596
I think about tomorrow

30:07.889 --> 30:09.140
What is the problem?

30:09.265 --> 30:12.644
I can't see what's waiting for me
