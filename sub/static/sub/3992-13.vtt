WEBVTT

00:00.930 --> 00:02.795
Previously on Hannibal.

00:02.830 --> 00:05.128
- We're just alike.
This gives you the capacity

00:05.170 --> 00:08.435
to deceive me
and be deceived by me.

00:11.570 --> 00:14.403
Have you been firing a gun?
- I told you I was feeling

00:14.440 --> 00:17.079
paranoid.
- All I want to do is catch him.

00:17.110 --> 00:19.078
- He's given me nothing.
-I know what to expect

00:19.120 --> 00:21.270
from lung cancer.
And there will be a time

00:21.320 --> 00:25.416
when there is nothing
you can do.

00:25.450 --> 00:27.554
No.
- What are you up to?

00:27.590 --> 00:30.184
- I want you
to come with me.

00:30.230 --> 00:33.620
Alana Bloom isn't harbouring any
doubts. She's convinced that
he murdered Freddie Lounds.

00:33.660 --> 00:36.595
- How was my funeral?
- We're gonna get caught.

00:36.630 --> 00:38.791
- Jack already suspects
you killed Freddie Lounds.

00:38.830 --> 00:42.231
- That means he suspects you.
- I know.
- You should give him

00:42.270 --> 00:45.068
what he wants.
- Give him the
Chesapeake ripper.

01:26.150 --> 01:28.618
- Dr. Hannibal Lecter requests
the pleasure

01:28.650 --> 01:31.710
of my company for dinner.

01:35.690 --> 01:37.749
- You sit
in that chair, Will,

01:37.790 --> 01:40.395
as you have
so many times before.

01:42.900 --> 01:46.290
It holds among its molecules
the vibrations

01:46.340 --> 01:51.460
of all our_co_nversations
ever held In Its presence.

01:51.510 --> 01:54.570
- All the exchanges,

01:54.610 --> 01:58.649
the petty irritations,

01:58.680 --> 02:01.911
deadly revelations,

02:01.950 --> 02:06.785
flat announcements
of disaster.

02:06.820 --> 02:09.323
- The grunts and poetry
of life.

02:09.360 --> 02:13.228
Everything we've
ever said.

02:13.260 --> 02:15.251
Listen.

02:17.630 --> 02:20.463
What do you hear?

02:20.500 --> 02:25.267
(whispering voices)

02:25.310 --> 02:28.234
- A melody.

02:28.280 --> 02:30.748
- We're orchestrations
of carbon.

02:33.380 --> 02:35.416
You and me.

02:39.320 --> 02:42.858
- And Jack.

02:42.890 --> 02:47.350
- And Jack.

02:47.400 --> 02:49.766
All our destinies
flying and swimming

02:49.800 --> 02:53.338
in blood and emptiness.

02:57.840 --> 03:02.448
- Everybody's settling
in for dinner.

03:02.480 --> 03:04.448
- I'm wearing a wire.
I have sharp shooters

03:04.480 --> 03:07.244
on the roofs of neighbouring
houses with lines of site

03:07.280 --> 03:09.919
to all the windows.
- He'll try to kill you

03:09.950 --> 03:13.784
in the kitchen.
For convenience.

03:13.820 --> 03:18.359
Make it easier
to prepare the tartar.

03:21.500 --> 03:23.718
Jack won't be easy
to kill.

03:23.770 --> 03:28.230
He'll be armed.

03:28.270 --> 03:32.274
He's strong,
well-trained.

03:32.310 --> 03:35.006
We can't hesitate.

03:35.040 --> 03:41.275
- Hannibal thinks
you are his man in the room.

03:41.320 --> 03:45.609
I think you're mine.

03:45.650 --> 03:48.551
- When a fox hears a rabbit
scream, he comes running.

03:48.590 --> 03:51.320
But not to help.

03:53.660 --> 03:56.595
When you hear Jack scream,
why will you come running?

04:01.000 --> 04:03.764
When the moment comes.

04:03.810 --> 04:05.766
- When the moment comes.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.941
- Will you do
what needs to be done?

04:18.350 --> 04:21.478
- Oh yes.

04:56.090 --> 04:58.320
(dogs barking)

05:01.930 --> 05:03.921
(growling)

05:05.900 --> 05:09.563
- Shhhh.

05:32.160 --> 05:37.769
- See?
See.

06:02.560 --> 06:05.654
(haggard breathing)

06:08.000 --> 06:11.458
- Forgiveness is
such a profound,

06:11.500 --> 06:15.129
conscious and unconscious
state of affairs.

06:17.670 --> 06:22.642
You can't actually
choose to do it.
- Mmhm.

06:22.680 --> 06:26.548
- It simply happens
to you.

06:29.150 --> 06:31.710
- Does forgiveness happen
to you?

06:35.990 --> 06:40.791
- I died.

06:40.830 --> 06:44.698
I'm between deaths.

06:46.940 --> 06:49.909
- The punctuation
at the end of a sentence

06:49.940 --> 06:54.775
gives meaning to every word,
every space that proceeded it.

06:54.810 --> 07:02.148
- They moved my punctuation
mark, Dr. Lecter.

07:02.180 --> 07:07.709
You moved my meaning.

07:07.760 --> 07:12.459
(coughing)

07:36.750 --> 07:40.914
I'm not here
because I want to be here.

07:40.960 --> 07:44.054
You saw to that.

07:44.090 --> 07:48.493
I'm here...

07:48.530 --> 07:53.092
because I can't
abandon Jack.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.893
Not again.

07:58.010 --> 07:59.978
- Love and death
are the great hinges

08:00.010 --> 08:05.676
on which all
human sympathies turn.

08:05.710 --> 08:07.917
What we do for ourselves
dies with us.

08:07.950 --> 08:10.089
What we do for others...
That's beyond us.

08:10.120 --> 08:13.009
- You saved me
for Jack.

08:18.160 --> 08:22.665
Will you save him
for me,

08:22.700 --> 08:26.830
when I'm gone?

08:26.870 --> 08:28.997
-Hmm.

08:34.810 --> 08:37.574
- I'm going to enjoy
my resurrection.

08:37.610 --> 08:41.910
Nothing sells better
than a survival story.

08:41.950 --> 08:45.784
- I wouldn't count us _
as surVIvors Just yet, Freddie.

08:45.820 --> 08:49.756
- Counting me as a survivor?
I started as a cancer editor

08:49.790 --> 08:51.758
at a supermarket tabloid.

08:51.790 --> 08:56.022
- Cancer is very
lucrative media.

08:58.070 --> 09:02.063
- "New Cures for Cancer,"
"Cancer Miracle Cure."

09:02.100 --> 09:04.534
- We're all desperate
for a little hope.

09:10.980 --> 09:14.814
I want to ask you to do
something for me, Freddie.

09:14.850 --> 09:16.841
Or rather, don't.

09:22.320 --> 09:26.950
Don't write
about Abigail.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.367
You can write
about me.

09:30.400 --> 09:32.960
You can write
about Hannibal.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.663
But, leave Abigail alone?

09:41.080 --> 09:43.378
- You really don't know
if you're going

09:43.410 --> 09:45.970
to survive him, do you?

09:48.280 --> 09:51.909
Just let her rest
In peace.

10:15.910 --> 10:18.105
These are your notes
on me.

10:20.420 --> 10:22.615
So they are.

11:03.490 --> 11:07.722
Don't your patients need these
after you're gone?

11:07.760 --> 11:11.321
- The FBI will pore over
my notes ifI left them intact.

11:11.370 --> 11:14.259
I will spare
my patients the scrutiny.

11:14.300 --> 11:19.977
I'm dismantling who I was
and moving it brick by brick.

11:26.980 --> 11:29.710
When we've gone
from this life,

11:29.750 --> 11:32.856
Jack Crawford
and the FBI behind us,

11:32.890 --> 11:35.950
I will always
have this place.

11:35.990 --> 11:38.925
- In your memory palace?

11:38.960 --> 11:42.350
- My palace is vast,
even by medieval standards.

11:42.400 --> 11:46.097
The foyer is
of Norman Chapel in Palermo.

11:46.130 --> 11:50.362
Severe, beautiful
and timeless.

11:50.410 --> 11:53.732
With a single reminder
of mortality.

11:53.780 --> 11:59.400
A skull.
Graven in the floor.

12:03.450 --> 12:07.853
- All I need is...
a stream.

12:07.890 --> 12:11.018
- In those moments
where you can't overcome

12:11.060 --> 12:16.327
your surroundings,
you can make it all go away.

12:16.360 --> 12:19.761
- Put my head back,
close my eyes,

12:19.800 --> 12:23.099
wade into the quiet
of the stream.

12:29.510 --> 12:32.946
- If I'm ever apprehended,
my memory palace

12:32.980 --> 12:36.541
will serve as_ more
than a mnemonIc system.

12:36.580 --> 12:38.787
I will live there.

12:40.920 --> 12:43.150
- Could you be
happy there?

12:43.190 --> 12:46.557
- All the path's chambers
are not lovely,

12:46.590 --> 12:48.558
light and bright.

12:48.600 --> 12:52.889
In the walls of our hearts
and brains, danger waits.

12:52.940 --> 12:56.194
There are holes
in the floor of the mind.

14:14.320 --> 14:18.518
- In the few jerlq seconds
of sleep I do get,

14:21.560 --> 14:26.327
all I see is dark,
swarming behind my eyelids.

14:29.930 --> 14:33.889
I dream _darkness comes
Into me.

14:33.940 --> 14:37.068
It comes and it's insidious.

14:39.140 --> 14:43.008
Up my nose into my ears.

14:49.550 --> 14:52.018
I feel poisoned.

14:58.460 --> 15:01.952
- We're all poisoned.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.163
- You saw what
no one else could.

15:12.010 --> 15:16.276
- All it took was the, uh,
traumatic.

15:16.310 --> 15:19.438
- We're still in
the thick of it.

15:24.050 --> 15:26.518
- We're getting through
the worst of it.

15:35.500 --> 15:37.695
- You've set some
sort of trap

15:37.730 --> 15:40.290
and you're goading
Hannibal into it.

15:45.410 --> 15:48.072
How can you be sure
he's not goading you?

15:52.110 --> 15:54.476
- I can't.

16:34.390 --> 16:39.089
- Do you know what
an imago is, Will?

16:39.130 --> 16:42.452
- It's a flying insect.

16:42.500 --> 16:46.596
- It's the last stage
of a transformation.

16:46.630 --> 16:50.703
- When you become
who you will be?

16:50.740 --> 16:52.708
- It's also a term

16:52.740 --> 16:55.470
from the dead religion
of psychoanalysis.

16:55.510 --> 16:59.378
An imago is an image
of a loved one,

16:59.410 --> 17:02.538
bunedin
the unconSCIous,

17:02.580 --> 17:05.185
carried with us
all our lIves.

17:05.220 --> 17:08.519
- An ideal.

17:08.560 --> 17:13.293
- The concept
ofanideaL"

17:13.330 --> 17:15.594
I have a concept
of you,

17:15.630 --> 17:17.598
just as you have
a concept of me.

17:17.630 --> 17:20.565
- Neither of us ideal.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.701
- Both of _us are
too curIous

17:29.740 --> 17:33.119
about too many things
for any ideals.

17:39.250 --> 17:43.459
Is it ideal
that Jack die?

17:46.660 --> 17:49.697
- It's necessary.

17:49.730 --> 17:54.463
What happens to Jack
has been preordained.

18:00.180 --> 18:02.637
- We could
disappear now.

18:02.680 --> 18:04.671
Tonight.

18:09.580 --> 18:11.548
Feed your dogs,

18:11.590 --> 18:15.481
leave a note for Alana _
and never see her or Jack agaIn.

18:18.290 --> 18:21.418
Almost polite.

18:24.170 --> 18:27.492
- Then this would be
our last supper.

18:31.740 --> 18:33.879
- Of this life.

18:33.910 --> 18:39.507
We'll serve _|amb.
- SacrIfICIal.

18:42.450 --> 18:45.681
- I don't need
a sacrIfIce,

18:45.720 --> 18:48.883
do you?

18:48.920 --> 18:52.253
- I need him to know.

18:55.630 --> 19:00.329
If I confess to Jack Crawford
right now,

19:03.210 --> 19:05.269
- I would forgive you.

19:08.810 --> 19:12.803
If Jack were to tell you
all is forgiven,

19:12.850 --> 19:16.672
would you accept
his forgiveness?

19:22.520 --> 19:26.957
- Jack isn't offering
forgiveness.

19:26.990 --> 19:32.292
He wants... justice.

19:35.370 --> 19:38.669
He wants to see you,

19:38.710 --> 19:41.838
see who you are.

19:41.880 --> 19:45.441
See what I've become.

19:51.250 --> 19:54.708
He wants the truth.

20:06.830 --> 20:11.506
- Tell the truth, then.

20:11.540 --> 20:14.475
And all its consequences.

20:31.060 --> 20:33.028
- This is entrapment, Jack.

20:33.060 --> 20:34.994
- You can't entrap someone

20:35.030 --> 20:37.567
into committing
premeditated murder.

20:37.600 --> 20:40.535
- Yes, you can.
You're doing it.

20:40.570 --> 20:43.266
You conspired to violate
Dr. Lecter's property

20:43.310 --> 20:46.507
and personal rights.
And for the record,

20:46.540 --> 20:49.304
the only one involved
in this investigation

20:49.340 --> 20:53.515
we can confirm actually having
killed someone is Will Graham.

20:53.550 --> 20:56.519
- It was self defense.

20:59.450 --> 21:03.682
- Hannibal Lecter is being
induced to commit murder

21:03.730 --> 21:07.325
by an undercover
FBI informant.

21:07.360 --> 21:10.523
This is outrageous
government conduct.

21:10.570 --> 21:13.368
You would_ne_ver
get a conVIctIon.

21:13.400 --> 21:15.368
You're not thinking
clearly, Jack.

21:15.400 --> 21:17.504
- We are as close as we are
ever gomg to get

21:17.540 --> 21:19.963
to catching this man.

21:21.980 --> 21:25.074
- I understand that your wife
is very ill.

21:25.110 --> 21:28.944
You're dis_trac_ted.
After an IanIry,

21:28.980 --> 21:31.710
I'm putting you on forced
compassionate leave.

22:40.120 --> 22:44.625
- This is just staggering.

22:44.660 --> 22:47.629
- What are you going to do
about Hannibal Lecter?

22:47.660 --> 22:49.753
- What Jack should
have done.

22:49.800 --> 22:51.768
We've frozen
hIs passport

22:51.800 --> 22:53.995
and we're getting
a search warrant.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.099
- Hannibal already opened
his doors to the FBI,

22:56.140 --> 22:58.108
there won't be
phySIcal eVIdence.

22:58.140 --> 23:00.506
The only way to catch him
is in the act.

23:00.540 --> 23:04.647
- Are you saying we should have
just let Jack hang himself?

23:04.680 --> 23:07.103
And everyone else
in his department?

23:07.150 --> 23:09.641
- No. But Will and Jack
are still your best chance

23:09.680 --> 23:12.945
to catch Hannibal.

23:12.990 --> 23:18.587
- This man that Will Graham
killed in self defense...

23:18.630 --> 23:22.088
he was mutilated.
At a certaIn pomt,

23:22.130 --> 23:25.122
self defense stops.
Will Graham didn't stop.

23:25.170 --> 23:30.062
Jack Crawford sanctioned this
and then he hid it from us.

23:30.100 --> 23:34.503
- I have to believe
that Will was trying

23:34.540 --> 23:36.531
_ to maintain
hIs cover IdentIty.

23:36.580 --> 23:38.798
- Reality doesn't
go away

23:38.850 --> 23:41.546
because you stop
believing in it.

23:41.580 --> 23:44.083
It's stubborn like that.
The reality of this situation

23:44.120 --> 23:47.146
is Jack Crawford misused
the power of his office.

23:47.190 --> 23:49.658
- Mrs. Prurnell,

23:49.690 --> 23:52.557
they are desperate.

23:52.590 --> 23:55.991
- They are breaking
the law.

23:59.130 --> 24:01.690
I'm bringing these men
up on charges.

24:01.740 --> 24:05.039
- They're not going
to stop.

24:05.070 --> 24:08.233
- That's why they're being
brought into custody.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.544
- Jack knows what
yoquﬁnd.

24:10.580 --> 24:12.571
He knows what
you have to do.

24:12.610 --> 24:16.444
That won't stop him
from doing what he has to do.

24:32.230 --> 24:36.769
(phone ringing)

24:38.970 --> 24:41.632
- Hello?

24:41.680 --> 24:43.978
- [It's Alana.
Is Jack with you?]

24:44.010 --> 24:47.241
- No, why?

24:47.280 --> 24:50.909
- They've issued a warrant
for your arrest, Will.

24:50.950 --> 24:55.114
For acting as an accessory
to entrapment

24:55.160 --> 24:57.549
(dogs barking)

24:57.590 --> 25:00.127
[and for the murder
of Randall Tier.]

25:02.200 --> 25:05.658
[They're going to arrest
Jack as well.]

25:07.300 --> 25:10.599
[Wi||?]

25:10.640 --> 25:13.200
- Goodbye, Alana.

25:23.220 --> 25:28.055
(phone rings)

25:28.090 --> 25:30.650
- Hello?

25:33.060 --> 25:36.291
- They know.

26:04.060 --> 26:07.757
- Hello, Jack.
You're early.

26:07.800 --> 26:11.167
- I couldn't wait
to get here.

26:13.370 --> 26:16.191
- Would you care
to sous-chef?

26:18.370 --> 26:23.171
- I want to thank you
for your friendship, Hannibal.

26:27.110 --> 26:29.670
- The most beautiful quality
of a true friendship

26:29.720 --> 26:31.847
is to understand them.

26:31.890 --> 26:34.358
Be understood
with absolute clarity.

26:39.390 --> 26:42.052
- And this is...

26:42.100 --> 26:45.319
the clearest moment
of our frIendshIp.

27:47.290 --> 27:50.123
- Argh!

28:08.120 --> 28:10.418
- I'd like
to report gunshots.

29:10.110 --> 29:12.146
Hannibal.

29:16.020 --> 29:19.114
Hannibal!

29:26.060 --> 29:28.255
Where's Jack?

29:30.430 --> 29:34.036
- In the pantry.

29:36.200 --> 29:40.000
I was hoping you and I
wouldn't have to say goodbye.

29:40.040 --> 29:43.532
Nothing seen nor said.

29:46.250 --> 29:48.275
You may have found
that rude.

29:48.320 --> 29:50.880
- STOP!

29:53.450 --> 29:57.284
I was so blind.

29:57.320 --> 30:02.019
- In your defense,
I worked very hard to blind you.

30:02.060 --> 30:06.565
You can stay blind.

30:06.600 --> 30:10.559
You can hide from this.

30:10.600 --> 30:14.878
Walk away, I'll make no plans
to call on you.

30:14.910 --> 30:17.799
But if you stay,
I will kill you.

30:25.150 --> 30:28.210
Be blind, Alana.
Don't be brave.

30:36.430 --> 30:39.194
(clicks)

30:41.100 --> 30:45.366
I took your bullets.
(Alana whimpering)

31:32.620 --> 31:35.111
- I found more bullets!

32:01.420 --> 32:03.911
Abigail?

32:06.020 --> 32:08.284
- I'm so sorry.

32:08.320 --> 32:11.221
(medieval music)

33:15.720 --> 33:18.621
- This is Will Graham,
I need ERT.

33:22.230 --> 33:24.221
Jack is inside.

33:31.440 --> 33:33.431
Go...

33:54.130 --> 33:57.327
(choking sounds)

34:43.710 --> 34:45.701
(footsteps)

35:02.900 --> 35:06.859
Abigail?

35:06.900 --> 35:10.859
- I didn't know
what else to do, so...

35:10.900 --> 35:14.529
I just did
what he told me.

35:16.540 --> 35:19.145
- Where is he?

35:31.930 --> 35:36.196
Y-- you were supposed...
to leave.

35:41.440 --> 35:43.590
- We _couldn't leave
WIthout you.

35:59.890 --> 36:02.518
- Ah!

36:13.930 --> 36:17.229
- Time did reverse

36:17.270 --> 36:21.229
the teacup that I shattered
there to come together.

36:23.780 --> 36:27.500
The place was made
for Abigail and your world.

36:27.550 --> 36:29.848
Do you understand?

36:33.790 --> 36:37.180
The place was made
for all of us, together.

36:41.700 --> 36:43.725
I wanted
to surprIse you.

36:46.270 --> 36:48.989
And you...

36:49.040 --> 36:51.508
you wanted
to surprise me.

36:57.510 --> 37:00.308
(sputtering)

37:01.880 --> 37:03.916
I have let you
know me.

37:07.890 --> 37:10.358
See me.

37:10.390 --> 37:12.529
I gave you
ame&

37:15.630 --> 37:18.997
But you didn't want it.
- Didn't I?

37:21.070 --> 37:24.904
- You would deny me my life.
- N-- no. No.

37:24.940 --> 37:26.999
Not your life, no.

37:27.040 --> 37:29.372
- My freedom then,
you would take that from me.

37:31.080 --> 37:34.277
_Come_find me
In a prIson cell.

37:42.060 --> 37:44.551
Do you believe
you could change me,

37:44.590 --> 37:47.627
the way I've changed you?

37:47.660 --> 37:50.697
- I already did.

37:57.940 --> 38:01.034
- Fate and circumstance
have returned us to this moment

38:03.880 --> 38:07.646
when the teacup shatters.

38:11.120 --> 38:14.783
I forgive you, Will.

38:18.390 --> 38:20.358
Will you forgive me?

38:20.390 --> 38:24.793
- Don--, don't...,

38:24.830 --> 38:27.492
No. No.

38:30.740 --> 38:32.105
N-- no. No. No.

38:32.140 --> 38:34.335
Abigale, come to me.

38:44.720 --> 38:47.348
(gulping)

39:01.570 --> 39:03.993
- You can make it
all go away.

39:04.040 --> 39:07.134
Put your head back.

39:07.170 --> 39:10.003
Close your eyes.

39:11.910 --> 39:14.879
Wade into the quiet
of the stream.

39:30.960 --> 39:33.497
- Argh! Ah!

40:16.510 --> 40:19.570
(gasping)

40:35.230 --> 40:37.425
Hello? Jack...

41:44.330 --> 41:47.527
Closed Captioning by SE'I'I'E inc.

42:23.270 --> 42:26.831
- Jus d'orange? Eau? Champagne?

42:26.870 --> 42:29.202
- Je voudrais du champagne,
s'il vous plat.

42:29.240 --> 42:33.848
Merci. _

Madame? _
