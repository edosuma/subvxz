00:43.144 --> 00:44.475
(Meredith) WE'VE ALL HEARD
THE BUZZ WORDS...
NOW THE INITIAL PROGRAM...

00:44.475 --> 00:47.218
"STREAMLINE, OPTIMIZE,

00:47.218 --> 00:50.081
INTEGRATE, ADAPT."

00:50.081 --> 00:53.154
(speaking indistinctly)
EVERY DAY SOMEONE COMES UP
WITH A NEW STRATEGY OR TOOL

00:53.154 --> 00:56.487
OR TECHNOLOGY
TO INCREASE OUR EFFICIENCY.

00:56.487 --> 00:57.728
(continues
speaking indistinctly)

00:57.728 --> 01:00.361
THE IDEA
IS TO MAKE OUR LIVES EASIER.

01:00.361 --> 01:02.133
BUT THE QUESTION IS,
DOES IT?

01:02.133 --> 01:05.065
AND OF COURSE, ULTIMATELY REDUCE
COSTLY LITIGATION.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.138
SO DOES THAT ANSWER
YOUR QUESTIONS?

01:07.138 --> 01:08.439
WITH DISTURBING CLARITY.

01:08.439 --> 01:11.742
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S MOVE ON THEN.

01:11.742 --> 01:14.145
AS YOU CAN SEE, THIS O.R.
HAS BEEN ARRANGED

01:14.145 --> 01:16.147
WITH MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY,

01:16.147 --> 01:18.509
SPECIFICALLY
FOR O.R. TURNOVER.

01:18.509 --> 01:20.411
NOW WHAT ARE THE MAIN CAUSES
FOR BOTTLENECK?

01:20.411 --> 01:22.613
THE LAYOUT OF O.R. SUPPLIES,

01:22.613 --> 01:25.716
EQUIPMENT, AND INSTRUMENTS.

01:25.716 --> 01:27.518
SO WHAT WE HAVE DONE HERE...
(lowered voice)
WHAT DID WE MISS?

01:27.518 --> 01:29.160
O.R.s ARE SLOPPY.

01:29.160 --> 01:30.661
THERE ARE DOCTORS
IN THE CEILINGS.

01:30.661 --> 01:32.793
WHAT? WHAT DO--WHAT DOES
THAT EVEN MEAN?

01:32.793 --> 01:35.426
(tsks)
WE'D KNOW IF YOU'D JUST
PUT HER STUPID TIGHTS ON HER.

01:35.426 --> 01:37.097
I WAS TALKING HER INTO IT,
OKAY?

01:37.097 --> 01:38.729
SHE WAS GETTING ON BOARD.
UM, SHE'S 2.
AT A CERTAIN POINT,

01:38.729 --> 01:40.131
SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO
GET ON BOARD.

01:40.131 --> 01:41.372
SHE HAS TO BE IN DAY CARE.
SO YOU PICK HER UP

01:41.372 --> 01:42.433
AND YOU
YANK HER TIGHTS ON HER.
(chuckles)

01:42.433 --> 01:43.804
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.
AND THEN SHE CRIES.

01:43.804 --> 01:45.176
YEAH, BECAUSE YOU WASTED
ALL THAT TIME CAJOLING HER,

01:45.176 --> 01:46.337
SO NOW I HAVE TO BE
THE BAD COP.

01:46.337 --> 01:47.578
IF YOU JUST MADE IT CLEAR
IN THE FIRST PLACE

01:47.578 --> 01:48.779
THAT SHE HAS NO CHOICE--
(tsks)

01:48.779 --> 01:50.141
BECAUSE
WHEN EVERY SECOND COUNTS,

01:50.141 --> 01:51.442
YOU NEED
THE MOST EFFICIENT APPROACH.

01:51.442 --> 01:54.585
MM.
WHAT SHE SAID.

01:54.585 --> 01:56.217
IT'S ABOUT
NEW HOSPITAL PROCEDURES,

01:56.217 --> 01:57.888
AND WE WEREN'T INVITED.

01:57.888 --> 01:59.550
THANK GOD.
IT LOOKS BORING.

01:59.550 --> 02:01.152
DON'T YOU GUYS GET
WHAT'S GOING ON?

02:01.152 --> 02:03.123
YEAH, THEY'RE CLOSING THE E.R.
AND STREAMLINING THE PLACE.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.355
IT SUCKS, BUT--

02:04.355 --> 02:05.626
THEY'RE GONNA FIRE US.

02:05.626 --> 02:06.797
WHY BOTHER TEACHING US
THE NEW PROTOCOLS

02:06.797 --> 02:08.259
IF WE'RE GONNA
BE GONE ANYWAY?

02:08.259 --> 02:10.501
YOU'RE CRAZY.
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

02:10.501 --> 02:11.662
IS IT?

02:11.662 --> 02:12.863
LOOK AT THIS.

02:14.805 --> 02:16.767
NURSES ARE STOCKPILING.

02:16.767 --> 02:18.809
THE END IS COMING.

02:18.809 --> 02:20.511
(people speaking indistinctly)

02:20.511 --> 02:22.443
YOUR AVERAGE TIME
BETWEEN SURGERIES

02:22.443 --> 02:23.914
IS 37 MINUTES.

02:23.914 --> 02:25.846
WITH THESE NEW
O.R. PROCEDURES,

02:25.846 --> 02:27.748
I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT
CUT IN HALF.

02:27.748 --> 02:29.180
THANK YOU, EVERYONE.

02:29.180 --> 02:30.821
(doctors speaking indistinctly)

02:30.821 --> 02:32.183
(sighs)

02:32.183 --> 02:33.654
CLOSING THE E.R.
SHOULD CUT DOWN ON TIME.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.186
WE WON'T HAVE ANY PATIENTS.

02:35.186 --> 02:36.527
HOW'S HUNT FEEL
ABOUT THAT?

02:36.527 --> 02:37.858
OH, HE SAYS HE'S NOT
GONNA DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT

02:37.858 --> 02:39.190
UNTIL IT ACTUALLY HAPPENS.

02:39.190 --> 02:40.361
OH, IT'S HAPPENING.

02:40.361 --> 02:41.532
AND HE CAN'T BE
A TRAUMA SURGEON

02:41.532 --> 02:42.693
WITHOUT AN E.R.

02:42.693 --> 02:43.834
IS HE GONNA LEAVE TOWN?

02:43.834 --> 02:45.366
'CAUSE IF YOU GO WITH HIM,
I'M SCREWED.

02:45.366 --> 02:46.637
I'M KIND OF DEPENDING
ON YOUR RENT CHECK.

02:46.637 --> 02:47.798
WAY TO MAKE THIS
ALL ABOUT YOU.

02:47.798 --> 02:48.939
THE E.R.
IS NOT GOING TO CLOSE.

02:48.939 --> 02:50.301
DEREK HAS A PLAN.

02:50.301 --> 02:51.802
WHERE IS DEREK?

02:51.802 --> 02:53.704
HE SPENT THE NIGHT
WITH KEPNER.
(elevator bell dings)

02:53.704 --> 02:54.905
(exhales) IT'S GONNA WORK,
RIGHT?

02:54.905 --> 02:56.247
OF COURSE. SEE, 'CAUSE
IF DERM CUTS A FELLOW,

02:56.247 --> 02:57.848
AND THEN CARDIO
SKIPS THE TED CONFERENCE,

02:57.848 --> 03:00.851
PLASTIC/ORTHO SHARES,
UH, LAB FACILITIES,

03:00.851 --> 03:02.413
WE'LL GET A LITTLE BIT HERE,
A LITTLE BIT THERE.

03:02.413 --> 03:04.255
AND WE'LL HAVE ENOUGH SAVED
TO KEEP THE E.R. ALIVE.

03:04.255 --> 03:06.587
OH, THERE GONNA BE MAD
ABOUT THE TED CONFERENCE.

03:06.587 --> 03:07.758
OH, THEY'RE GONNA BE
PISSED ABOUT EVERYTHING,

03:07.758 --> 03:08.889
BUT THAT'S OKAY.
IT'S GONNA WORK.

03:08.889 --> 03:09.860
DO WE HAVE A REPLY YET?

03:09.860 --> 03:12.323
UH, NO, NOT YET.

03:12.323 --> 03:13.824
THAT WAS THE SUBJECT LINE?

03:13.824 --> 03:15.195
WH-WH-WHAT,
IS THAT BAD?

03:15.195 --> 03:16.367
WELL, WOULD YOU OPEN
AN E-MAIL

03:16.367 --> 03:17.698
THAT SAID
"PROPOSED BUDGET CUTS"?

03:17.698 --> 03:19.370
OH, NO. DID I
JUST KILL OUR PROPOSAL?

03:19.370 --> 03:21.372
NO. WE'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO PITCH IT IN PERSON.

03:21.372 --> 03:23.203
GO DOOR TO DOOR,
WHICH IS BETTER ANYWAY.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.905
IT'S HARD TO SAY NO
TO SOMEONE'S FACE.

03:24.905 --> 03:26.307
OH. NO OFFENSE, SIR.

03:26.307 --> 03:27.908
YOU HAVE AN UNUSUALLY
APPEALING FACE, BUT--

03:27.908 --> 03:28.879
I HAVE TO BRUSH MY TEETH.

03:28.879 --> 03:30.241
MM-HMM.

03:30.241 --> 03:31.782
I KNOW. YOU DO, TOO.
OH.

03:31.782 --> 03:33.284
STANDARDIZING AN O.R.
IS ONE THING,

03:33.284 --> 03:35.746
BUT THAT'S NOT GOING TO
MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE

03:35.746 --> 03:38.789
IF WE DON'T STANDARDIZE
WHAT HAPPENS IN THE O.R.

03:38.789 --> 03:41.392
TO THAT END, I HAVE BROUGHT IN
DR. DARRELL NESBAUM

03:41.392 --> 03:42.953
TO SHOW US HOW IT CAN BE DONE.

03:44.955 --> 03:48.399
(Alana) EVERYTHING
WILL BE SCANNED...
WHEN DID YOU BECOME
SUCH A KISS-ASS?

03:48.399 --> 03:50.861
THE LAST FIVE HOSPITALS
WHOSE EFFICIENCY SHE IMPROVED

03:50.861 --> 03:53.864
ENDED UP CUTTING THEIR STAFF
BY 30%.

03:53.864 --> 03:56.006
I'LL LEARN TO ROPE CATTLE
IF IT MEANS KEEPING MY JOB.
(cell phone chimes)

03:56.006 --> 03:59.770
WELL, I'M SAFE BECAUSE THEY
CAN'T FIRE THE PREGNANT LADY.

03:59.770 --> 04:01.472
CAN THEY?

04:01.472 --> 04:03.774
(Alana) UH, DR. NESBAUM,
YOU CAN TAKE IT FROM HERE.

04:03.774 --> 04:04.975
OF COURSE.

04:04.975 --> 04:06.917
GOOD MORNING, EVERYBODY.

04:06.917 --> 04:10.521
NOW I HAVE JUST ONE QUESTION
BEFORE WE BEGIN.

04:10.521 --> 04:12.923
ARE YOU READY TO ROCK
SOME HERNIAS?

04:12.923 --> 04:14.355
WHOO!

04:14.355 --> 04:16.357
THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT.

04:16.357 --> 04:17.888
(doctors murmuring indistinctly)
(laughs)

04:17.888 --> 04:19.590
(people speaking indistinctly)

04:19.590 --> 04:22.333
(woman speaks indistinctly
over p.a.)

04:22.333 --> 04:24.495
HAS SHE MOVED YET?
(exhales)

04:24.495 --> 04:25.796
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

04:25.796 --> 04:26.937
IS HER MOM HERE?

04:26.937 --> 04:28.299
'CAUSE SHE'S NICER
WHEN HER MOM'S HERE.

04:28.299 --> 04:29.470
NO, SHE HAD TO LEAVE
FOR WORK.

04:29.470 --> 04:30.641
YOU SURE THE KID
DIDN'T EAT HER?

04:30.641 --> 04:32.272
(laughs)
(sighs) YOU GUYS, STOP.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.745
SHE'S ANGRY. SHE'S 13 AND SHE
HAD A DOUBLE HIP REPLACEMENT.

04:34.745 --> 04:35.946
YOU'D BE ANGRY, TOO.

04:35.946 --> 04:36.907
SHE'S MEAN.

04:36.907 --> 04:38.278
LIKE A BADGER.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.750
SHE'S THREE DAYS
POST-OP NOW. OKAY?

04:39.750 --> 04:42.282
IF SHE DOESN'T MOVE HER HIPS,
WE'RE LOOKING AT CLOTS,

04:42.282 --> 04:43.814
CONTRACTURES,
POOR RECOVERY.

04:43.814 --> 04:46.056
WE JUST HAVE TO MAKE HER
DO IT FOR HER OWN GOOD.

04:46.056 --> 04:48.459
OH. (chuckles)
LOOK WHO I'M TALKING TO.

04:48.459 --> 04:50.961
CAN'T EVEN PUT
A TODDLER IN TIGHTS.
(elevator bell dings)

04:50.961 --> 04:52.923
OH. OH. OH.

04:52.923 --> 04:54.365
GR--WELL, THEN YOU JUST--

04:54.365 --> 04:55.966
YOU SHOW ME HOW
A BAD COP DOES IT.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.371
KAREV, GET IN THERE.

05:00.371 --> 05:01.672
WHY ME?

05:01.672 --> 05:02.833
WE'RE ATTENDINGS.
YOU'RE A FELLOW.

05:02.833 --> 05:04.505
IT'S AN ORDER.

05:04.505 --> 05:06.306
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

05:06.306 --> 05:08.779
THAT'S HOW A BAD COP
DOES IT.
(chuckles)

05:08.779 --> 05:11.011
DR. HUNT, I SENT CONTRACTORS
TO MEASURE THE E.R. SPACE.

05:11.011 --> 05:12.713
YEAH, AND I TOLD THEM
TO GET LOST.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.345
I KNOW.
THAT'S WHY WE'RE TALKING.

05:14.345 --> 05:16.417
THE E.R. IS OPEN
FOR ONE MORE DAY.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.918
UH, DR. HUNT,

05:17.918 --> 05:19.049
THE E.R. IS CLOSING.

05:19.049 --> 05:20.591
I KNOW
YOU DON'T WANT IT TO,

05:20.591 --> 05:21.892
BUT YOU'RE GONNA NEED
TO LET THAT GO.

05:21.892 --> 05:23.754
WHILE WE
ARE TREATING PATIENTS,

05:23.754 --> 05:25.896
I DON'T WANT YOUR WORKMEN
IN THE WAY.

05:25.896 --> 05:27.327
(elevator bell dings)

05:27.327 --> 05:28.499
WE ARE ON A TIGHT SCHEDULE
WITH THE RENOVATION.

05:28.499 --> 05:30.030
I WAS HOPING
THAT YOU WOULD COOPERATE.

05:30.030 --> 05:32.062
YEAH, WELL, YOU'RE GONNA NEED
TO LET THAT GO.

05:32.062 --> 05:33.604
WELL...

05:33.604 --> 05:34.835
(doors close)

05:34.835 --> 05:36.437
I'D JUST LIKE TO HEAR YOU
NAME ONE THING

05:36.437 --> 05:37.608
THAT YOU CAN PUT IN THERE

05:37.608 --> 05:38.769
THAT'S MORE USEFUL
THAN AN E.R.

05:38.769 --> 05:40.040
IT'S STILL UNDER REVIEW,
BUT--

05:40.040 --> 05:41.572
IN THE ARMY,
THE GUYS AT THE FRONT

05:41.572 --> 05:43.013
GET THE MOST SAVES.

05:43.013 --> 05:45.045
WHY? BECAUSE THE CLOSER YOU ARE
TO THE MOMENT OF INJURY,

05:45.045 --> 05:46.617
THE BETTER CHANCE
YOU HAVE TO HELP.

05:46.617 --> 05:47.778
THAT IS WHAT AN E.R. IS.

05:47.778 --> 05:48.949
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

05:48.949 --> 05:50.120
ROOF.
MEDEVAC'S COMING.

05:50.120 --> 05:51.882
UH, I-I-I SHOULDN'T.

05:51.882 --> 05:53.754
I SHOULD HOP OFF NOW--

05:53.754 --> 05:55.456
EMERGENCY MEDICINE
IS THE FRONT LINE.

05:55.456 --> 05:57.488
WE'RE THE FIRST RESPONDER.
WE'RE CLOSEST.

05:57.488 --> 05:59.590
IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
THAT A HOSPITAL DOES.

05:59.590 --> 06:00.831
IT'S ARGUABLY--

06:00.831 --> 06:02.062
SO NAME ME ONE THING

06:02.062 --> 06:03.734
THAT YOU WOULD REPLACE IT WITH
THAT MATTERS MORE.

06:03.734 --> 06:04.895
(sighs)
(bell dings)

06:04.895 --> 06:06.136
YOU'VE MADE YOUR POINT.

06:06.136 --> 06:07.998
NOW IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I HAVE A BIG DAY, AND I--

06:07.998 --> 06:11.402
40-YEAR-OLD MALE LOGGER
VERSUS CHAIN SAW.
(helicopter blades whirring)

06:11.402 --> 06:13.774
DEEP NECK LACERATION AFFECTING
MOST OF THE MAJOR BLOOD VESSELS

06:13.774 --> 06:14.905
AND EXTENDING
INTO THE CHEST.

06:14.905 --> 06:16.947
HE'S HYPOTENSIVE
AND TACHYCARDIC.

06:16.947 --> 06:18.479
OH, AND HIS NOSE
IS PRETTY MUCH SLICED OFF.

06:18.479 --> 06:19.850
(groaning)
(Owen) HOW'S HIS AIRWAY?

06:19.850 --> 06:21.111
INTACT.
IT WAS NEVER STRIDOROUS.

06:21.111 --> 06:22.953
DID NOT APPEAR
TO INVOLVE THE TRACHEA.

06:22.953 --> 06:24.455
OH!

06:24.455 --> 06:25.816
OH! I GOT IT. I GOT IT.

06:25.816 --> 06:28.689
IT'S THE CAROTID.
I HAVE IT.

06:28.689 --> 06:30.461
I GOT IT.

06:30.461 --> 06:33.023
I WAS CLOSEST.

06:33.023 --> 06:47.538
(exhales)

06:48.439 --> 06:49.610
(staff speaking indistinctly))

06:49.610 --> 06:50.781
OKAY, EVERYTHING
APPEARS STABLE.

06:50.781 --> 06:52.513
LET'S REDRESS THE NOSE.
PAGE PLASTICS.

06:52.513 --> 06:53.884
(woman) RIGHT AWAY.
GOWN ME.

06:53.884 --> 06:55.686
WORK AROUND DR. CAHILL.

06:55.686 --> 06:56.987
AND SEE WHO ELSE
IS AVAILABLE.

06:56.987 --> 06:58.148
(woman) I'LL CHECK.
KEEP HOLDING PRESSURE.

06:58.148 --> 06:59.590
AS SOON AS I FIND
ANOTHER SURGEON,

06:59.590 --> 07:01.692
I'LL TAKE OVER
AND I'LL GET YOU OUT OF THERE.

07:01.692 --> 07:02.753
NO, I GOT IT.

07:02.753 --> 07:03.824
HAVING ONE PERSON
CONTROL THE CAROTID

07:03.824 --> 07:06.997
LIMITS HIS CHANCE
OF STROKING OUT.

07:06.997 --> 07:09.530
ALL RIGHT. GOWN HER, TOO.

07:09.530 --> 07:10.831
(woman) RIGHT AWAY.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.002
START WITH RUSSELL.

07:12.002 --> 07:13.203
YOU WANT TO DO
THE OPENER OR ME?

07:13.203 --> 07:14.565
WELL, THE NUMBERS
ARE SO COMPELLING.

07:14.565 --> 07:15.806
I THINK I'D START WITH
HOW MUCH

07:15.806 --> 07:17.137
HIS DEPARTMENT'S CUTS
WILL SAVE THE HOSPITAL.

07:17.137 --> 07:18.509
AND THEN I WOULD--

07:18.509 --> 07:19.740
I'LL--I'LL DO THE OPENER.

07:19.740 --> 07:20.971
SORRY. I GET A LITTLE EXCITED
ABOUT STATISTICS.

07:20.971 --> 07:22.613
NOT EVERYBODY SHARES
THAT PASSION.
NOT EVERYBODY.

07:22.613 --> 07:24.174
(smartphone chirps)
OKAY, SO YOU DO
THE TALKING,

07:24.174 --> 07:25.516
AND I'LL HOLD UP THE CHART
WHEN YOU GIVE ME THE SIGNAL?

07:25.516 --> 07:27.017
PERFECT. OH, DAMN IT.

07:27.017 --> 07:28.178
HUNT NEEDS ME
IN THE O.R.

07:28.178 --> 07:29.550
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO START
WITHOUT ME.

07:29.550 --> 07:30.721
NO. P-PEOPLE DON'T LIKE ME.

07:30.721 --> 07:31.752
(elevator bell dings)
TALK FROM YOUR HEART,

07:31.752 --> 07:33.083
NOT ABOUT THE CHARTS
OR THE NUMBERS.

07:33.083 --> 07:34.625
YOU CAN DO THIS.

07:34.625 --> 07:35.626
(people speak indistinctly)
AH...

07:35.626 --> 07:38.629
(beeping)

07:38.629 --> 07:39.790
(whooshes)

07:39.790 --> 07:41.131
AND THERE YOU HAVE IT.

07:41.131 --> 07:43.534
A TECHNIQUE I HAVE DEVELOPED
THROUGH YEARS

07:43.534 --> 07:44.965
OF HIGHLY FOCUSED RESEARCH.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.137
I EAT, SLEEP,
AND BREATHE HERNIAS, FOLKS.

07:47.137 --> 07:49.640
AFTER TODAY, SOMETHING TELLS ME
YOU WILL, TOO.

07:49.640 --> 07:50.801
GROSS.

07:50.801 --> 07:52.142
DR. NESBAUM.

07:52.142 --> 07:54.474
OVER THE YEARS,
I'VE DEVELOPED MY OWN TECHNIQUE

07:54.474 --> 07:55.976
FOR A HERNIA REPAIR.

07:55.976 --> 07:59.610
SO IF IT'S ALL THE SAME
TO YOU, I'LL STICK TO THAT.

07:59.610 --> 08:01.552
I'M SURE IT'S LOVELY,
BUT THE POINT HERE

08:01.552 --> 08:03.013
IS TO STANDARDIZE THE WAY
SEATTLE GRACE MERCY WEST

08:03.013 --> 08:04.184
APPROACHES THE HERNIA

08:04.184 --> 08:06.717
SO EVERY O.R. CAN BE PREPPED
THE SAME WAY.

08:06.717 --> 08:10.020
IT'S QUICK, CLEAN,
EFFICIENT.

08:10.020 --> 08:11.261
I SUPPOSE.

08:11.261 --> 08:13.564
(laughs)
LISTEN TO OLD MAN WEBBER,

08:13.564 --> 08:15.566
"MY WAYS
ARE THE BEST WAYS.

08:15.566 --> 08:18.569
OOH, IT'S DRAFTY IN HERE.
SOMEBODY BRING ME A BLANKET."

08:18.569 --> 08:20.000
(laughs)

08:20.000 --> 08:22.573
NOW WHAT DO YOU SAY TO A LITTLE
FRIENDLY COMPETITION, HMM?

08:22.573 --> 08:24.905
THE FIRST SURGEON WHO CAN
PERFORM 20 HERNIA REPAIRS

08:24.905 --> 08:27.507
USING MY EXACT TENSION-FREE
MESH TECHNIQUE

08:27.507 --> 08:28.839
WILL WIN

08:28.839 --> 08:31.742
BRAGGING RIGHTS,
THE RESPECT OF THEIR PEERS,

08:31.742 --> 08:34.244
AND AHA...

08:34.244 --> 08:36.787
THIS SWEET BABY.

08:36.787 --> 08:39.049
OH. I'VE SEEN THOSE
IN THE GIFT SHOP.

08:39.049 --> 08:40.591
THEY'RE NOT CHEAP.

08:40.591 --> 08:42.753
I KNEW IT. THEY'RE MAKING US
FIGHT TO SURVIVE.

08:42.753 --> 08:43.924
FIRST PRIZE IS A FLEECE.

08:43.924 --> 08:46.597
SECOND PRIZE IS
A ONE-WAY TICKET TO THE CURB.

08:46.597 --> 08:48.028
SHALL WE BEGIN?

08:48.028 --> 08:50.000
(exhales) TRIBUTES,

08:50.000 --> 08:53.704
MAY THE ODDS BE EVER
IN YOUR FAVOR.

08:53.704 --> 08:57.708
(rock 'n' roll music
playing indistinctly)

08:58.969 --> 09:01.071
TAKE 'EM OFF.

09:01.071 --> 09:02.242
(music stops)

09:02.242 --> 09:03.714
WHAT?

09:03.714 --> 09:06.016
WELL, WE GOTTA GET YOU
UP AND MOVING.

09:06.016 --> 09:07.177
TODAY'S THE DAY.

09:07.177 --> 09:08.548
MAYBE TOMORROW'S THE DAY.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.850
LOOK,
IF YOU DON'T GET UP,

09:09.850 --> 09:11.622
YOUR HIPS
AREN'T GONNA HEAL RIGHT.

09:11.622 --> 09:12.583
I DON'T CARE.

09:12.583 --> 09:13.924
I KNOW IT'S HARD.

09:13.924 --> 09:15.626
BUT YOU'RE ONLY 13.

09:15.626 --> 09:16.757
YOU TALK LIKE
YOUR WHOLE LIFE IS OVER.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.158
LIKE YOU EVEN KNOW
WHAT MY LIFE WAS.

09:18.158 --> 09:21.291
I KNOW THAT YOU WERE
INTO GYMNASTICS.

09:21.291 --> 09:22.663
(huffs)

09:22.663 --> 09:24.064
I WASN'T "INTO GYMNASTICS,"
STUPID.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.596
IT WAS MY CAREER.

09:25.596 --> 09:27.067
EVER SINCE I WAS 4 YEARS OLD,

09:27.067 --> 09:29.670
IT'S ALL
I'VE EVER WANTED TO DO.

09:29.670 --> 09:32.142
MY MOM WORKED DOUBLE SHIFTS
SO I COULD BE IN THE GYM

09:32.142 --> 09:33.303
FIVE HOURS A DAY.

09:33.303 --> 09:34.675
MORE ON THE WEEKENDS.

09:34.675 --> 09:36.907
AND I KNEW THAT IF I WORKED
REALLY HARD,

09:36.907 --> 09:39.810
SOMEDAY SHE WOULDN'T
HAVE TO ANYMORE.

09:39.810 --> 09:41.311
I RANKED NUMBER ONE

09:41.311 --> 09:43.614
AT THE FUTURE STARS NATIONALS
LAST YEAR.

09:43.614 --> 09:45.616
I WAS GOING
TO THE RIO OLYMPICS.

09:45.616 --> 09:47.087
I WAS NEXT.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.689
WHEN MY HIPS STARTED TO HURT,

09:48.689 --> 09:50.020
I THOUGHT THAT I PULLED
A MUSCLE,

09:50.020 --> 09:52.092
SO I TRAINED THROUGH IT.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.965
(huffs) I'M NOT NEXT ANYMORE.

09:54.965 --> 09:56.667
I'M NOTHING.
I'M NUMBER ZERO.

09:56.667 --> 09:58.829
HEY. NO, YOU'RE NOT.

09:58.829 --> 10:01.171
MAYBE THIS PART
MIGHT BE OVER,

10:01.171 --> 10:04.134
BUT YOU GOT TIME
TO DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS.

10:04.134 --> 10:06.637
THEY SAID THAT IF THE SURGERY
WAS SUCCESSFUL,

10:06.637 --> 10:08.809
I MIGHT BE ABLE
TO RIDE A BIKE,

10:08.809 --> 10:11.041
'CAUSE THAT'S AS GOOD AS HAVING
YOUR FACE ON A SLURPEE CUP,

10:11.041 --> 10:13.183
RIGHT?

10:13.183 --> 10:16.016
YOU MIGHT UNDERSTAND IF...

10:16.016 --> 10:19.019
YOU'VE EVER BEEN GREAT
AT SOMETHING...

10:19.019 --> 10:22.192
BEEN BEST AT SOMETHING.

10:22.192 --> 10:27.157
SO, YEAH,
MY LIFE IS OVER AT 13.

10:27.157 --> 10:30.330
I GET TO RIDE A BIKE
AND GO TO SCHOOL

10:30.330 --> 10:32.202
AND WAIT TO DIE.

10:34.234 --> 10:37.237
(rock 'n' roll music
playing indistinctly)

10:40.340 --> 10:42.242
(woman) CARDIO TECH
TO ROOM THE E.R.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.644
CARDIO TECH TO THE E.R.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.677
DR. YANG,
ABOUT THE I.V. HEPARIN

10:46.677 --> 10:48.148
YOU ORDERED FOR ROOM THREE.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.980
(clicks keyboard keys)

10:49.980 --> 10:51.822
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

10:51.822 --> 10:54.354
NO. IT'S JUST
DR. RICHARDSON INSISTS

10:54.354 --> 10:56.687
I GIVE SUB-Q ENOXAPARIN.

10:56.687 --> 10:58.258
(people speaking indistinctly)

10:58.258 --> 11:01.692
WHO THE HELL
IS DR. RICHARDSON?

11:01.692 --> 11:03.093
(elevator bell dings)

11:03.093 --> 11:05.395
OH, YEAH. IGNORE IT.

11:05.395 --> 11:07.097
I TRIED.

11:07.097 --> 11:08.438
HE KEEPS INSISTING,

11:08.438 --> 11:11.041
AND IT'S REALLY UPSETTING
THE PATIENT.

11:11.041 --> 11:14.705
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

11:19.349 --> 11:22.012
Open the pod bay doors, Hal.

11:22.012 --> 11:25.085
It's Bob Richardson.
Dr. Richardson.

11:25.085 --> 11:26.957
I have a little problem,
Bob.

11:26.957 --> 11:28.759
I'm here to help.

11:28.759 --> 11:30.220
(whirs)
You're supposed to be
our eyes in the sky, correct?

11:30.220 --> 11:31.691
Yes.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.393
Then how about
you just do that?

11:33.393 --> 11:34.895
I'm sorry?

11:34.895 --> 11:36.266
Don't question
my medical decisions.

11:36.266 --> 11:38.368
If I order my intern
to give I.V. heparin,

11:38.368 --> 11:39.699
I WANT I.V. HEPARIN.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.471
Uh, I guess
you haven't read the results

11:41.471 --> 11:43.003
from the SYNERGY trial,

11:43.003 --> 11:46.336
which showed Enoxaparin
reduced the need for monitoring.

11:46.336 --> 11:49.709
OH. GOT A LOT OF TIME
TO READ, BOB,

11:49.709 --> 11:50.841
hanging out
in your underwear,

11:50.841 --> 11:52.843
watching
your wall of monitors?

11:52.843 --> 11:55.485
'Cause that same trial found
that there was more bleeding--
Dr. Yang.

11:55.485 --> 11:56.917
THE PIT'S CALLING WITH

11:56.917 --> 11:58.188
A POSSIBLE CARDIAC TRAUMA
IN THE FIELD.

11:58.188 --> 11:59.449
FIVE MINUTES AWAY.

12:00.951 --> 12:02.492
DON'T TRY AND BE
A DOCTOR, BOB.

12:02.492 --> 12:04.124
JUST MAKE SURE
MY IDIOT INTERNS

12:04.124 --> 12:05.295
don't screw up.

12:05.295 --> 12:06.827
Give the I.V. heparin.

12:06.827 --> 12:08.398
Don't butt in.

12:08.398 --> 12:11.461
Let's go.

12:11.461 --> 12:13.433
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

12:13.433 --> 12:15.465
(indistinct conversations)

12:15.465 --> 12:18.438
DR. RUSSELL.
DR. KEPNER, TRAUMA.

12:18.438 --> 12:21.271
TRAUMA, OF SAINTED MEMORY.
(elevator bell dings)

12:21.271 --> 12:23.273
ACTUALLY, UM, WE'RE TRYING
TO SAVE THE DEPARTMENT,

12:23.273 --> 12:25.275
I WAS WONDERING IF COULD
TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOME IDEAS.

12:25.275 --> 12:28.278
GOT YOUR E-MAIL.
"PROPOSED BUDGET CUTS."

12:28.278 --> 12:29.449
NICE TRY.

12:29.449 --> 12:31.451
WELL, I THINK YOU'LL SEE
THAT A 2%...

12:31.451 --> 12:33.924
OKAY, UH, NUMBERS
DON'T REALLY MATTER. I, UM--

12:33.924 --> 12:35.425
EVER BEEN
TO A TED CONFERENCE?

12:35.425 --> 12:36.486
I HAVEN'T.

12:36.486 --> 12:37.858
INSPIRING.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.029
FINEST MINDS
OF OUR GENERATION

12:39.029 --> 12:40.260
UNDER ONE ROOF,

12:40.260 --> 12:41.962
SHARING STORIES
OF MIND-BENDING INNOVATION.

12:41.962 --> 12:43.363
THAT SOUNDS GREAT BUT--

12:43.363 --> 12:46.296
INNOVATION IS WHAT'S
GONNA SAVE THIS HOSPITAL...

12:46.296 --> 12:47.467
OKAY.

12:47.467 --> 12:48.438
NOT THIS PENNY SAVED,
PENNY EARNED CRAP.

12:48.438 --> 12:49.800
OKAY, BUT, UM--

12:49.800 --> 12:52.542
GOOD TO MEET YOU,
DR. KEPLER.

12:52.542 --> 12:53.773
KEPNER.

12:53.773 --> 12:57.007
(indistinct conversations
continue)

12:57.007 --> 12:58.178
THIS IS A MESS.

12:58.178 --> 12:59.509
I DON'T THINK WE CAN
FIX THIS PRIMARILY.

12:59.509 --> 13:02.482
CAN YOU CHECK
FOR BACK BLEEDING?

13:02.482 --> 13:04.554
CAHILL?

13:04.554 --> 13:05.515
ME?

13:05.515 --> 13:06.887
YEAH, YOU'RE HOLDING
THE CLAMP.

13:06.887 --> 13:09.159
IF YOU CAN'T DO IT, THEN--
OKAY.

13:09.159 --> 13:11.892
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

13:11.892 --> 13:13.093
HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY.

13:13.093 --> 13:14.564
OKAY. WHICH MEANS HE HAS
POOR COLLATERAL FLOW.

13:14.564 --> 13:16.266
WE'RE GONNA NEED A SHUNT.

13:16.266 --> 13:18.999
I CAN PUT IT IN IF SOMEONE WILL
GET ME A RUMMEL TOURNIQUET.

13:18.999 --> 13:21.001
(beeping continues)

13:21.001 --> 13:22.903
THANK YOU.

13:22.903 --> 13:24.534
(suction gurgling)

13:24.534 --> 13:28.078
(humming)

13:28.078 --> 13:29.910
(Owen chuckles)

13:29.910 --> 13:32.412
(continues humming)

13:32.412 --> 13:34.444
(stops humming)
SORRY.

13:34.444 --> 13:35.916
I-I USED TO DO THAT.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.417
(chuckles) IT'S LIKE
RIDING A BIKE, HUH?

13:37.417 --> 13:39.249
YEAH, IF THE BIKE'S GOING
200 MILES AN HOUR.

13:39.249 --> 13:40.390
THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT FUN.

13:40.390 --> 13:41.922
YEAH, DAMN RIGHT, IT DOES.

13:41.922 --> 13:44.194
SO WHY DID YOU STOP
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

13:44.194 --> 13:45.395
(door opens)

13:45.395 --> 13:46.556
YEAH, HUNT,
I GOT YOUR PAGE.

13:46.556 --> 13:48.058
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT
A BRAIN BLEED?

13:48.058 --> 13:49.399
YEAH, WE DIDN'T GET
A CHANCE TO DO THE SCAN.

13:49.399 --> 13:50.560
HIS CAROTID BLEW.

13:50.560 --> 13:51.932
IS THAT KEPNER?

13:51.932 --> 13:53.904
CAHILL.
DR. SHEPHERD, HI.

13:53.904 --> 13:55.065
SO INSTEAD OF TELLING US
HOW TO DO OUR JOBS,

13:55.065 --> 13:56.306
NOW YOU'RE JUST DOING THEM?

13:56.306 --> 13:57.507
THAT WOULD BE
MORE EFFICIENT.

13:57.507 --> 13:58.869
NO, SHE WAS
IN THE RIGHT PLACE

13:58.869 --> 14:00.170
AT THE RIGHT TIME.

14:00.170 --> 14:01.341
SHE PROBABLY SAVED HIS LIFE.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.013
I GOT LUCKY.

14:03.013 --> 14:05.175
LUCKY FOR THIS GUY
HIS CHAIN SAW SLIPPED TODAY.

14:05.175 --> 14:07.447
TOMORROW
HE'D BE DEAD ALREADY.

14:07.447 --> 14:09.419
(beeping continues)

14:09.419 --> 14:10.580
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

14:10.580 --> 14:12.122
SKATEBOARDER VERSUS CAR.

14:12.122 --> 14:13.423
LATE TEENS.
DIDN'T HAVE I.D.

14:13.423 --> 14:15.425
THE KID WAS SLALOMING HILLS
WITH A BUDDY.

14:15.425 --> 14:17.227
WAS NONRESPONSIVE
IN THE FIELD.

14:17.227 --> 14:18.588
HIS LAST SYSTOLIC WAS 70.

14:18.588 --> 14:20.260
HEART RATE TACKING ALONG
IN THE 130s.

14:20.260 --> 14:23.363
E.K.G. SHOWS SOME CHANGES,
SO I SUSPECT CARDIAC TRAUMA.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.395
OKAY, I NEED A PORTABLE X-RAY
UP HERE, STAT.

14:25.395 --> 14:28.398
I NEED A 12-LEAD, AND, UH,
LET'S GET A T.E.E. BEDSIDE.

14:28.398 --> 14:30.000
(man) RIGHT AWAY.
READY ON THREE.
ONE, TWO, THREE.

14:31.441 --> 14:33.303
MURPHY, SET UP THE T.E.E.
GOT IT.

14:33.303 --> 14:35.175
TYPE AND CROSS
FOR SIX UNITS.

14:35.175 --> 14:36.977
HANG TWO UNITS OF O-NEG
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

14:36.977 --> 14:38.148
HEY,
WHAT'S YOUR BUDDY'S NAME?

14:38.148 --> 14:39.649
UM, RICH. RICH CAMPION.

14:39.649 --> 14:41.011
DOES HE HAVE ANY ALLERGIES
THAT YOU KNOW OF?

14:41.011 --> 14:42.182
IS HE ON ANY MEDICATIONS?

14:42.182 --> 14:43.984
I-I-I DON'T KNOW.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.155
LOOK,
IS HE GOING TO BE OKAY?

14:45.155 --> 14:48.418
WE'RE DOING
EVERYTHING WE CAN.

14:48.418 --> 14:50.460
NO BREATH SOUNDS ON THE RIGHT.
SOMEONE SET UP A CHEST TUBE.

14:50.460 --> 14:51.621
(woman) ON IT.

14:51.621 --> 14:53.924
IT LOOKS LIKE
A MEDIASTINAL HEMATOMA.

14:53.924 --> 14:55.365
COULD BE
AN AORTIC TRANSECTION.

14:55.365 --> 14:56.927
UH, WE NEED TO MOVE FAST,
PEOPLE.

14:56.927 --> 14:58.098
(monitor beeping erratically)

14:58.098 --> 14:59.499
B.P.'s STILL DROPPING.
SCISSORS.

14:59.499 --> 15:01.301
YEAH, HE'S CRASHING.
WHERE IS THAT BLOOD?

15:01.301 --> 15:02.602
(woman) RIGHT HERE, DOCTOR.

15:02.602 --> 15:04.504
OH, HE HAS A MEDICAL I.D.
IT MUST HAVE BROKEN OFF.

15:04.504 --> 15:06.436
(Cristina) OKAY. WHAT'S IT SAY?
WHAT'S HE ALLERGIC TO?

15:06.436 --> 15:07.607
OH, GOD.

15:07.607 --> 15:09.539
WHAT IS HE ALLERGIC TO?

15:09.539 --> 15:12.312
OKAY, STOP.

15:12.312 --> 15:14.644
HE'S A JEHOVAH'S WITNESS.
WE CAN'T GIVE HIM BLOOD.

15:14.644 --> 15:18.548
(beeping continues)

15:25.225 --> 15:26.396
THEY'RE PREPPING THE O.R.
FOR A BLOODLESS SURGERY

15:26.396 --> 15:27.557
SO WE'LL NEED TO RECIRCULATE
HIS BLOOD.

15:27.557 --> 15:28.698
SO WE'LL PUT HIM
ON A CELL SAVER MACHINE,

15:28.698 --> 15:30.330
AND THEN CONTINUE
THE HYPERTONIC SALINE,

15:30.330 --> 15:32.632
COLLOIDS, AND FACTOR VII TO PUMP
UP HIS INTRAVASCULAR VOLUME.

15:32.632 --> 15:34.464
WE'RE SERIOUSLY REPAIRING
AN AORTIC TRANSECTION

15:34.464 --> 15:35.605
WITHOUT BLOOD?

15:35.605 --> 15:38.108
YEAH, WE HAVE NO CHOICE.
WE COULD USE BLOOD.

15:38.108 --> 15:40.110
(elevator bell dings)
OH, WE COULD ALSO BE ARRESTED
FOR ASSAULT AND BATTERY.

15:40.110 --> 15:41.241
VERY FUNNY.

15:41.241 --> 15:42.572
I'M NOT JOKING.

15:42.572 --> 15:43.713
THERE ARE PROTOCOLS IN PLACE
FOR PEOPLE WHO WON'T

15:43.713 --> 15:45.245
OR CAN'T ACCEPT
SUPPLEMENTAL BLOOD.

15:45.245 --> 15:46.716
WE DO BLOODLESS SURGERIES
HERE ALL THE TIME.

15:46.716 --> 15:49.519
HAVE YOU EVER DONE THIS--
A BLOODLESS AORTIC TRANSECTION?

15:49.519 --> 15:51.681
NO.

15:51.681 --> 15:54.084
(woman) DR. RADNOR
TO LABOR AND DELIVERY...

15:54.084 --> 15:55.255
I-I HEAR YOU.
I DID.

15:55.255 --> 15:56.956
AND...

15:56.956 --> 15:58.288
ALEX.
OH.

15:58.288 --> 15:59.589
YOU DON'T HAVE HER
WALKING YET?

15:59.589 --> 16:01.491
OH, THERE'S NO TALKING
TO THAT GIRL.

16:01.491 --> 16:02.632
IT'S DARK IN THERE.

16:02.632 --> 16:04.064
REALLY DARK.

16:04.064 --> 16:05.235
KAREV--
I'M SERIOUS.

16:05.235 --> 16:06.596
THAT GIRL TURNED ME
INTO A SUICIDE RISK.

16:06.596 --> 16:07.967
(elevator bell dings)

16:07.967 --> 16:09.339
I'M GONNA MOVE HER
MYSELF THEN.

16:09.339 --> 16:10.970
MM. EXCESSIVE FORCE--
BAD COP'S GO-TO MOVE.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.602
OH. (laughs)

16:12.602 --> 16:14.644
YOU KNOW WHAT MAKES
A BAD COP BAD?

16:14.644 --> 16:16.046
WHEN THE GOOD COP'S
NAMBY-PAMBY APPROACH

16:16.046 --> 16:17.207
GETS US NOWHERE.

16:17.207 --> 16:18.348
THEN BAD COP
HAS TO SET A LIMIT

16:18.348 --> 16:20.050
AND ENDS UP LOOKING LIKE
A BIG MEANIE.

16:20.050 --> 16:22.352
A GOOD COP'S APPROACH
TAKES TIME

16:22.352 --> 16:23.513
AND PATIENCE.

16:23.513 --> 16:25.115
BAD COP
IS A NOTORIOUS HOTHEAD.

16:25.115 --> 16:27.187
IF SHE'S GOING TO INSIST
ON WEARING DRESSES,

16:27.187 --> 16:28.358
SHE HAS TO WEAR TIGHTS.

16:28.358 --> 16:30.390
I'M GONNA GO LIE DOWN.

16:31.761 --> 16:33.123
(monitor beeping erratically)

16:33.123 --> 16:34.464
HIS VITALS ARE WORSE.

16:34.464 --> 16:36.196
HOW'S THE CELL SAVER COMING?
(woman) ALMOST READY.

16:36.196 --> 16:37.497
DO WE HAVE SURGICAL GLUE?
YES.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.299
AVITENE?
YES.

16:39.299 --> 16:40.700
OKAY, I WANT TWO BOVIES
SET UP.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.772
I'M ON IT.
JOY, GET MY HEADLAMP READY.

16:42.772 --> 16:45.375
(woman) HERE IT IS.
WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

16:45.375 --> 16:47.407
WHERE IS MY GEL FOAM
AND THROMBIN?

16:47.407 --> 16:48.678
WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP
BLOOD LOSS TO A MINIMUM.

16:48.678 --> 16:50.310
WE NEED A WHOLE BUNCH MORE.

16:50.310 --> 16:52.312
OKAY, HYPERTONIC SALINE?
CHECK.

16:52.312 --> 16:54.114
FACTOR VII? CHECK.

16:54.114 --> 16:55.445
CELL SAVER READY?
CHECK.

16:55.445 --> 16:57.617
OKAY, LET'S GO
BEFORE HE BLEEDS OUT.

16:57.617 --> 17:02.452
(multiple monitors beeping)

17:02.452 --> 17:05.395
I CAN'T CUT.
HE'LL LOSE TOO MUCH BLOOD.

17:05.395 --> 17:06.556
WHAT DO WE DO?

17:06.556 --> 17:08.158
WE'LL GO IN PERCUTANEOUSLY.

17:08.158 --> 17:10.500
GET THE O.R. READY
FOR AN ENDOVASCULAR REPAIR.

17:10.500 --> 17:12.662
LET'S MOVE.

17:19.409 --> 17:22.041
EXCELLENT, DR. GREY.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.774
(chuckles)
19 MORE TO GO.

17:24.774 --> 17:26.316
YOU'RE GONNA CHOKE, GREY.

17:26.316 --> 17:28.718
YOU'LL CHOKE AND DIE,
AND I WILL DANCE AND SING.

17:28.718 --> 17:32.051
(sighs) DAMN IT. DAMN IT!

17:32.051 --> 17:34.554
THE MESH IS BUNCHING UP
AT THE PUBIC TUBERCLE.

17:34.554 --> 17:37.327
(exhales) YOU KNOW, I STILL
FEEL THAT YOU DO NOT--

17:37.327 --> 17:39.429
I UNDERSTAND THIS CAN
BE TRICKY AT FIRST,

17:39.429 --> 17:41.261
BUT ONCE YOU GET
THE HANG OF IT, YOU'LL SEE

17:41.261 --> 17:42.592
WHY A DOZEN HOSPITALS
AROUND THE COUNTRY

17:42.592 --> 17:43.833
HAVE ALREADY ADOPTED
THIS APPROACH,

17:43.833 --> 17:45.695
AND I'VE ALREADY HAD INQUIRIES
FROM A DOZEN MORE.

17:45.695 --> 17:47.667
CHECK!
EXCUSE ME.

17:49.299 --> 17:51.541
(sighs)

17:51.541 --> 17:54.374
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S THE RIGHT IDEA.

17:54.374 --> 17:55.605
BUT, UM--
BUT--BUT WHAT?

17:55.605 --> 17:56.776
WELL--
CHECK.

17:56.776 --> 17:58.148
CHECK!
(woman) CHECK!

17:58.148 --> 17:59.549
HEY, DON'T BEAT AROUND
THE BUSH.

17:59.549 --> 18:01.080
TELL ME WHAT YOU DON'T LIKE,
'CAUSE IT LOOKS PERFECT TO ME.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.482
O-OKAY. (chuckles)

18:02.482 --> 18:04.314
TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT DR. GREY
IS DOING OVER HERE.

18:04.314 --> 18:05.585
YOU SEE HOW SHE DOESN'T RUSH,

18:05.585 --> 18:07.287
CUT THE MESH JUST RIGHT?

18:07.287 --> 18:10.160
SEE, NOW WHEN DONE PROPERLY,
THE MESH WILL FIT PERFECTLY

18:10.160 --> 18:12.692
AND NOT REQUIRE
EXTRA SUTURES TO HOLD IT,

18:12.692 --> 18:15.665
THEREBY REDUCING THE RISK
OF FUTURE COMPLICATIONS.

18:15.665 --> 18:19.469
SO DO THIS OVER,
PAY ATTENTION TO THE DETAILS,

18:19.469 --> 18:21.201
AND TAKE YOUR TIME.

18:21.201 --> 18:23.203
(Meredith) I WOULD BE HAPPY

18:23.203 --> 18:24.774
TO GIVE YOU SOME POINTERS
IF YOU'D LIKE.

18:24.774 --> 18:26.736
THAT BUN IN THE OVEN
MAY GIVE YOU JOB SECURITY,

18:26.736 --> 18:27.877
MEREDITH GREY,

18:27.877 --> 18:29.579
BUT IT DOES NOT
MAKE YOU IMMUNE

18:29.579 --> 18:31.841
FROM A SMACK IN THE MOUTH.

18:31.841 --> 18:34.844
(people speaking indistinctly)

18:38.148 --> 18:39.649
RICH IS STILL IN SURGERY.

18:39.649 --> 18:41.621
UH, DR. YANG SENT ME DOWN
TO TALK TO HIS FAMILY.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.323
WELL, HOW--HOW'S HE DOING?

18:43.323 --> 18:44.654
IT'S TOUCH AND GO.

18:44.654 --> 18:46.856
THEY'RE GONNA TAKE HIM
BACK UP TO THE C.C.U.

18:46.856 --> 18:48.398
IS HIS FAMILY HERE?

18:48.398 --> 18:49.699
DUDE, LIKE...

18:49.699 --> 18:51.701
DOZENS OF THEM.
(man) LORD...

18:51.701 --> 18:54.534
YOU KNOW, I SWEAR, WE HUNG OUT
PRACTICALLY EVERY DAY.

18:54.534 --> 18:57.407
WE HAVE THE SAME SHIFT
AT THE SKATE SHOP.

18:57.407 --> 18:59.539
AND HE NEVER ONCE
MENTIONED TO ME

18:59.539 --> 19:01.371
THAT HE WAS
A JEHOVAH'S WITNESS.

19:01.371 --> 19:02.742
HE NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT.

19:02.742 --> 19:04.444
(man) FATHER OF ALL MERCY...

19:04.444 --> 19:05.845
I KIND OF DON'T THINK
HE IS.

19:05.845 --> 19:08.578
WELL, MAYBE IT WAS JUST
A PERSONAL THING.

19:08.578 --> 19:10.550
MAYBE, BUT I MEAN,
IF YOU...

19:10.550 --> 19:12.422
IF YOU BELIEVED IN SOMETHING
SO HARD

19:12.422 --> 19:15.855
THAT YOU WOULD DIE
FOR IT...

19:15.855 --> 19:17.557
WOULD YOU KEEP IT
A SECRET?

19:17.557 --> 19:20.290
WOULDN'T YOU AT LEAST
TELL YOUR FRIENDS?

19:20.290 --> 19:22.632
YEAH. YEAH, I GUESS.

19:22.632 --> 19:24.634
I SHOULD--LOOK, I GOTTA--
I GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE.

19:24.634 --> 19:26.936
WILL YOU--WILL YOU CALL ME
WHEN HE'S OUT?

19:26.936 --> 19:28.638
SURE. NO PROBLEM.

19:28.638 --> 19:29.939
(man speaks indistinctly)

19:29.939 --> 19:32.572
WITH WHICH WE OURSELVES
ARE BEING COMFORTED BY NOW.

19:32.572 --> 19:37.407
BLESSED BE THE GOD AND FATHER
OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST.

19:37.407 --> 19:38.878
(Alana) WE CAN'T REPAIR
THE CAROTID UNDER TENSION.

19:38.878 --> 19:40.250
IT'LL PULL APART.

19:40.250 --> 19:41.581
OR CLOT. IT'S TRICKY.

19:41.581 --> 19:43.583
WE CAN'T USE ONE OF THESE
VESSELS TO PATCH IT.

19:43.583 --> 19:46.686
THE CHAIN SAW CHEWED
EVERYTHING UP PRETTY GOOD.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.658
I COULD TAKE A PIECE OF
SAPHENOUS VEIN FROM THE LEG--

19:48.658 --> 19:50.660
YES. GOOD.

19:50.660 --> 19:52.762
GOOD.
GO AHEAD. PREP THE LEG.

19:52.762 --> 19:54.524
ALL RIGHT.
SCISSORS AND BETADINE, PLEASE.

19:54.524 --> 19:56.226
(woman) RIGHT AWAY,
DOCTOR.

19:56.226 --> 19:58.197
SO I HEAR SOMEBODY'S NOSE
CAME OFF?

19:58.197 --> 19:59.369
CAN I HAVE A HEADLAMP,
PLEASE?

19:59.369 --> 20:00.530
(Owen)
ALMOST. TAKE A LOOK.

20:00.530 --> 20:02.602
WELL, I WOULD
IF WE COULD FIND OUT

20:02.602 --> 20:04.904
WHERE WE'RE KEEPING
THE HEADLAMPS THESE DAYS.

20:04.904 --> 20:06.576
AND WHAT SHOULD'VE SHAVED OFF
HALF A SECOND

20:06.576 --> 20:08.238
HAS NOW ADDED FIVE.

20:08.238 --> 20:09.879
(sighs) THANK YOU.

20:09.879 --> 20:11.411
GAUZE, PLEASE.

20:11.411 --> 20:14.444
OH, SORRY.
MEANT TO JUST SAY "GAUZE."

20:14.444 --> 20:16.446
THAT "PLEASE" JUST COST ME
A TENTH OF SECOND.

20:16.446 --> 20:17.587
ALL RIGHT, AVERY.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

20:17.587 --> 20:19.449
CHIEF, YOU KNOW
THIS IS ALL ABOUT

20:19.449 --> 20:21.220
TURNING OVER THE TABLES
FOR HER.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.752
I MEAN, I FEEL LIKE
I'M WORKING THE DINNER SHIFT

20:22.752 --> 20:24.594
AT A JUMBO BURGER IN HERE.
DR. AVERY--

20:24.594 --> 20:26.456
SHE SHOULD JUST REPLACE US
WITH SURGICAL ROBOTS, REALLY.

20:26.456 --> 20:28.258
I MEAN, THAT'S ESSENTIALLY
WHAT SHE'S ASKING US TO BE.

20:28.258 --> 20:29.599
SHH.

20:29.599 --> 20:30.760
BLESS YOU. YOU DON'T
TELL US HOW TO RUN AN O.R.

20:30.760 --> 20:31.931
IF YOU DON'T ACTUALLY
WORK IN ONE.

20:31.931 --> 20:33.533
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

20:33.533 --> 20:35.635
YOU CAN TELL DR. PANTSUIT
HASN'T BEEN IN ONE IN YEARS.

20:35.635 --> 20:36.966
UNTIL TODAY.

20:42.612 --> 20:43.913
WELL...

20:43.913 --> 20:45.915
I CAN REPAIR THIS POST-OP.

20:45.915 --> 20:49.719
SO JUST GIVE ME A SHOUT
WHEN YOU'RE DONE.

20:49.719 --> 20:51.281
THANK YOU...

20:51.281 --> 20:53.353
DOCTORS.

20:53.353 --> 20:54.684
BEST OF LUCK.

20:54.684 --> 20:56.326
MM-HMM.

20:56.326 --> 20:58.728
I THOUGHT
I WAS GONNA BE FIRED.

20:58.728 --> 21:00.259
(clears throat)

21:00.259 --> 21:01.461
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

21:01.461 --> 21:02.592
OH, IT'S FINE.

21:02.592 --> 21:04.594
IT'S EASIER
IF THERE'S A BAD GUY.

21:04.594 --> 21:06.736
(sighs)

21:06.736 --> 21:08.738
MY PEOPLE JUST CARE
ABOUT THIS PLACE.

21:08.738 --> 21:09.839
I KNOW.

21:09.839 --> 21:11.571
I KNOW YOU'RE ALL UPSET,
ESPECIALLY YOU,

21:11.571 --> 21:13.042
LOSING YOUR E.R.

21:13.042 --> 21:14.604
BUT I ALSO KNOW
THAT WITHOUT ME,

21:14.604 --> 21:16.576
YOU'D LOSE
THIS ENTIRE HOSPITAL.

21:16.576 --> 21:19.609
SO IF YOU NEED TO BLAME ME
INSTEAD OF THANK ME,

21:19.609 --> 21:21.050
I'M FINE WITH THAT,

21:21.050 --> 21:23.913
BECAUSE I WILL KNOW
WHO SAVED IT.

21:23.913 --> 21:27.557
I'VE SAVED A DOZEN BEFORE
JUST LIKE THIS ONE,

21:27.557 --> 21:30.490
AND NO ONE THANKED ME
FOR THOSE EITHER.

21:30.490 --> 21:37.727
(monitor beeps rhythmically)

21:38.928 --> 21:40.630
LET'S ADD A C.P.K.
TO HIS NEXT BLOOD DRAW.

21:40.630 --> 21:42.031
WHAT WAS HIS LAST HEMOGLOBIN?

21:42.031 --> 21:43.933
4.

21:43.933 --> 21:45.635
THE GUY'S ON FUMES.

21:45.635 --> 21:47.337
(sighs) TRY AND STIMULATE
BLOOD PRODUCTION

21:47.337 --> 21:49.779
BY GIVING E.P.O.

21:49.779 --> 21:51.511
OR WE COULD...
GIVE HIM BLOOD

21:51.511 --> 21:52.812
AND CUT OUT
THE MIDDLE MAN.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.844
(Bob) We can also give I.V.
iron-dextran.

21:54.844 --> 21:56.416
THANKS, BOB.

21:56.416 --> 21:58.918
WE CAN GIVE HIM IRON?
HOW IS THAT LOGICAL?

21:58.918 --> 22:00.620
WE CAN GIVE HIM
THE COMPONENTS OF BLOOD,

22:00.620 --> 22:01.791
JUST NOT BLOOD?

22:01.791 --> 22:02.852
WE HAVE TO RESPECT
HIS WISHES.

22:02.852 --> 22:04.394
WHAT WISHES?
HE CAN'T TELL US ANYTHING.

22:04.394 --> 22:05.695
HIS FRIEND DIDN'T EVEN KNOW

22:05.695 --> 22:07.497
THAT HE WAS
A JEHOVAH'S WITNESS.

22:07.497 --> 22:08.658
YEAH, IT'S NOT
THE KIND OF THING

22:08.658 --> 22:09.829
YOU TALK ABOUT
AT THE SKATE PARK.

22:09.829 --> 22:11.831
I'M JUST SAYING, HE'S 19.

22:11.831 --> 22:13.663
HOW CAN HE EVEN KNOW
WHAT HE BELIEVES?

22:13.663 --> 22:15.334
WHEN I WAS 19,

22:15.334 --> 22:16.966
I WAS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
PERSON THAN I AM NOW.

22:16.966 --> 22:18.838
I WANTED TO BE
A RADIOLOGIST.

22:18.838 --> 22:21.841
WOW. I FEEL LIKE I'M SEEING
A WHOLE NEW YOU.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.373
UH, START HIS E.P.O.

22:23.373 --> 22:24.544
AND KEEP A CLOSE EYE
ON HIS CRIT.

22:24.544 --> 22:25.715
RIGHT AWAY, DOCTOR.

22:25.715 --> 22:26.676
(exhales)

22:26.676 --> 22:28.047
SO YOU'RE FINE WITH THIS?

22:28.047 --> 22:29.849
EVEN THOUGH HE COULD DIE,
YOU'RE FINE WITH JUST--

22:29.849 --> 22:31.020
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT I THINK.

22:31.020 --> 22:33.853
HE HAD AN ALERT.
IT WAS VERY CLEAR--NO BLOOD.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.655
I DON'T GET TO HAVE
AN OPINION ABOUT IT,

22:35.655 --> 22:36.786
AND NEITHER DO YOU.

22:37.827 --> 22:38.958
(sighs)

22:42.131 --> 22:43.793
SO THERE'S NOTHING
WE CAN DO?

22:43.793 --> 22:44.764
YEAH, THERE IS.

22:44.764 --> 22:47.797
WE CAN TALK TO THE FAMILY.

22:47.797 --> 22:49.739
Good luck.

22:51.801 --> 22:53.372
SIMMI, I NEED YOU
TO TAKE MY HAND.

22:53.372 --> 22:54.704
I'M GONNA HELP YOU SIT UP.

22:54.704 --> 22:56.606
YOU'RE GONNA SWING YOUR LEGS
TO THE SIDE

22:56.606 --> 22:58.748
AND YOU'RE GONNA
STAND UP.

22:58.748 --> 23:00.049
NOW.

23:00.049 --> 23:01.951
I DON'T GIVE YOU PERMISSION
TO TOUCH ME...

23:01.951 --> 23:03.713
LIKE, BODILY.

23:03.713 --> 23:04.814
I'LL SCREAM.

23:07.086 --> 23:09.118
SIMMI, IF YOU DON'T MOVE,
I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY

23:09.118 --> 23:10.820
THAT YOU'RE ACTING
AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE.

23:10.820 --> 23:12.822
WE WILL DISCHARGE YOU,
YOU WILL GO HOME,

23:12.822 --> 23:14.824
AND YOU WILL ROT, OKAY?

23:14.824 --> 23:16.125
THE MUSCLES AROUND
YOUR NEW HIPS WILL ATROPHY,

23:16.125 --> 23:18.598
AND YOU WILL PROBABLY
NEVER WALK AGAIN.

23:18.598 --> 23:20.600
WHY DO YOU CARE?

23:20.600 --> 23:22.702
BECAUSE I'M YOUR DOCTOR

23:22.702 --> 23:24.774
AND I WORKED VERY HARD
TO HELP YOU.

23:27.837 --> 23:30.009
WOULDN'T IT SUCK
IF YOU DIDN'T HELP ME?

23:30.009 --> 23:31.180
(scoffs)

23:31.180 --> 23:32.712
IF YOU WENT THROUGH
ALL OF THAT TRAINING

23:32.712 --> 23:33.843
TO BECOME A BIG DOCTOR,

23:33.843 --> 23:35.545
YOU CAME UP WITH A PLAN,

23:35.545 --> 23:37.547
YOU DID MY OPERATION,
YOU DID IT JUST RIGHT,

23:37.547 --> 23:38.948
JUST PERFECT,

23:38.948 --> 23:41.120
YOU MADE ME
SO I COULD WALK AGAIN,

23:41.120 --> 23:42.722
BUT I DIDN'T,

23:42.722 --> 23:45.925
WOULDN'T YOU FEEL HELPLESS,

23:45.925 --> 23:48.498
LIKE NOTHING MATTERS?

23:48.498 --> 23:50.630
NO MATTER HOW MUCH
YOU CARE,

23:50.630 --> 23:52.862
HOW HARD YOU TRY,

23:52.862 --> 23:56.806
HOW BADLY YOU WANT SOMETHING,

23:56.806 --> 23:59.769
YOU WILL NEVER HAVE IT...

23:59.769 --> 24:03.743
BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS TOTALLY
OUT OF YOUR CONTROL.

24:08.518 --> 24:09.749
FEEL THAT?

24:17.026 --> 24:18.728
COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT
BETTER MYSELF.

24:18.728 --> 24:19.689
YES!

24:19.689 --> 24:21.661
YES, INDEED.

24:21.661 --> 24:23.563
OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
PEOPLE OFTEN ASK ME

24:23.563 --> 24:25.895
HOW I CAN FOCUS SO MUCH TIME
ON HERNIAS

24:25.895 --> 24:28.037
AND MAINTAIN THIS LEVEL
OF EXCITEMENT.
(exhales)

24:28.037 --> 24:29.869
WELL, NOW YOU SEE--

24:29.869 --> 24:31.801
PERFECTION IS EXCITING.
(chuckles)

24:31.801 --> 24:33.202
YEAH.

24:33.202 --> 24:35.204
(laughs) HEAR THAT, GREY?

24:35.204 --> 24:37.046
I'M PERFECT.

24:37.046 --> 24:39.048
(exhales)
OH, LOOK AT
MISS SLOW AND STEADY OVER THERE.

24:39.048 --> 24:42.111
CAN'T EVEN BOTHER
TO PARTICIPATE.

24:43.613 --> 24:45.615
NO, SERIOUSLY, GREY,
YOU OKAY?

24:45.615 --> 24:48.217
UM, YEAH, YEAH.
I JUST NEED TO...

24:52.021 --> 24:53.192
(door opens)

24:53.192 --> 24:54.694
(clicks tongue)
DARN IT.

24:58.868 --> 25:01.030
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

25:01.030 --> 25:02.572
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

25:02.572 --> 25:04.233
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I GOT COMFORTABLE AND FLIP,

25:04.233 --> 25:06.706
AND THE UNIVERSE IS
SMACKING ME DOWN FOR IT.

25:06.706 --> 25:07.837
I-I'M NOT IMMUNE.
I'M NOT SAFE.

25:07.837 --> 25:09.779
WAIT, WAIT. GREY, STOP.

25:09.779 --> 25:11.180
WHAT IS GOING ON?

25:11.180 --> 25:14.784
THERE--THERE'S A FLUTTER.
I-IT'S--IT CAN'T BE RIGHT.

25:14.784 --> 25:18.087
(exhales deeply)

25:18.087 --> 25:20.790
OH, SWEETIE.
THIS IS NOT A BAD THING.

25:20.790 --> 25:21.891
WHAT? IT'S NOT?

25:21.891 --> 25:24.554
OH, NO, IT'S GOOD.

25:24.554 --> 25:25.955
IT'S SO GOOD.

25:28.057 --> 25:29.929
YOUR BABY'S KICKING.

25:29.929 --> 25:32.301
(gasps)

25:32.301 --> 25:33.733
OH.

25:33.733 --> 25:35.865
(chuckles)

25:35.865 --> 25:37.166
HE'S LOST A LOT OF BLOOD.

25:37.166 --> 25:39.238
I'D SAY MORE THAN HALF
HIS VOLUME.

25:39.238 --> 25:40.710
HE'LL MAKE NEW BLOOD.

25:40.710 --> 25:44.644
IT TAKES ABOUT FOUR DAYS
TO MAKE NEW BLOOD CELLS.

25:44.644 --> 25:46.115
HE MAY NOT HAVE
THAT MUCH TIME.

25:46.115 --> 25:47.546
WHAT WOULD REALLY HELP

25:47.546 --> 25:48.848
IS A BLOOD TRANSFUSION.

25:48.848 --> 25:50.980
NO. NO BLOOD.

25:50.980 --> 25:53.152
(Leah) IF YOU'RE WORRIED
ABOUT DISEASE TRANSMISSION,

25:53.152 --> 25:54.854
I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT
ALL OF OUR BLOOD

25:54.854 --> 25:56.185
IS METICULOUSLY SCREENED.

25:56.185 --> 25:58.087
IT'S NOT THAT WE DON'T
TRUST YOUR BLOOD.

25:58.087 --> 25:59.288
WE JUST--

25:59.288 --> 26:01.631
WE BELIEVE THAT LIFE
IS A GIFT FROM GOD

26:01.631 --> 26:03.893
AND WE DON'T TRY TO SUSTAIN IT
BY TAKING IN BLOOD.

26:03.893 --> 26:05.635
(people speaking indistinctly)

26:05.635 --> 26:07.737
LET ME BE PERFECTLY CLEAR,

26:07.737 --> 26:09.999
YOUR SON'S CONDITION
IS CRITICAL.

26:09.999 --> 26:13.072
WITHOUT BLOOD, HIS ORGANS
WILL START SHUTTING DOWN.

26:13.072 --> 26:15.344
AND ONCE HE STARTS
THAT SPIRAL,

26:15.344 --> 26:16.906
THERE IS NOTHING
WE CAN DO.

26:16.906 --> 26:18.077
OH, DEAR GOD.

26:18.077 --> 26:19.879
WE ARE JUGGLING ALL KINDS

26:19.879 --> 26:21.010
OF SUBSTITUTE MEASURES,

26:21.010 --> 26:23.613
BUT NOTHING
IS AS GOOD AS BLOOD.

26:23.613 --> 26:25.254
AS HIS SURGEON, I URGE YOU

26:25.254 --> 26:27.887
TO LET US GIVE HIM
THE BEST CHANCE WE CAN.

26:27.887 --> 26:29.288
LET US GIVE HIM BLOOD.

26:29.288 --> 26:32.191
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

26:32.191 --> 26:35.625
WE HAVE SEEN AMAZING MIRACLES
THROUGH PRAYER.

26:35.625 --> 26:38.297
(voice breaks)
IF IT'S GOD'S WILL...

26:38.297 --> 26:39.729
SO YOU WON'T ALLOW BLOOD,

26:39.729 --> 26:41.701
EVEN IF IT'S GONNA
SAVE HIS LIFE?

26:41.701 --> 26:42.872
'CAUSE PRAYER--
MURPHY.

26:42.872 --> 26:45.374
WE APPRECIATE ALL YOU'RE DOING
FOR OUR BOY.

26:45.374 --> 26:47.907
BUT YOUR BLOOD
WOULDN'T SAVE HIS LIFE.

26:47.907 --> 26:50.079
IT WOULD CONDEMN HIM.

26:51.781 --> 26:53.913
LIVING WITH IT WOULD BE
SO MUCH WORSE FOR HIM

26:53.913 --> 26:56.215
THAN DYING WITHOUT IT.

26:57.787 --> 26:59.018
WE UNDERSTAND.

26:59.018 --> 27:00.850
WE WILL DO EVERYTHING
IN OUR POWER

27:00.850 --> 27:02.692
TO KEEP YOUR SON ALIVE.

27:02.692 --> 27:04.754
(whispers) THANK YOU.

27:04.754 --> 27:08.357
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

27:08.357 --> 27:11.801
COLVIN SAID I WAS INSULTING HIM
AND EVERYONE IN HIS FIELD.

27:11.801 --> 27:13.903
BECK SAID SHE DOESN'T TALK
TO FUND-RAISERS.

27:13.903 --> 27:15.064
AND--AND SPRINGFIELD...
(laughs)

27:15.064 --> 27:16.906
BASICALLY HAD ME AGREEING
TO GIVE HIM MONEY.

27:16.906 --> 27:18.708
AND THEN RUSSELL--
YOU TALKED ABOUT THE NUMBERS?

27:18.708 --> 27:19.939
(elevator bell dings)
NO.

27:19.939 --> 27:21.110
APRIL.

27:21.110 --> 27:22.912
I... DIDN'T. I MEAN, JUST--
A TI--

27:22.912 --> 27:24.413
LIKE BARELY AT ALL.

27:24.413 --> 27:26.375
WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME,
BUT I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

27:26.375 --> 27:27.917
OH, THERE'S REDMOND.

27:27.917 --> 27:28.918
HEY, HEY, TIM.

27:28.918 --> 27:30.780
I SAW YOUR LITTLE HOWIE TODAY

27:30.780 --> 27:31.751
WHEN I WAS DROPPING ZOLA OFF
AT DAY CARE.

27:31.751 --> 27:32.882
MAN, HE'S CUTE.

27:32.882 --> 27:34.053
AH, THANKS.
YEAH, HE'S A KICK.

27:34.053 --> 27:35.254
YEAH, ZOLA'S AT THAT AGE

27:35.254 --> 27:36.425
WHERE SHE'S JUST PUTTING
EVERYTHING IN HER MOUTH.

27:36.425 --> 27:37.827
YEAH, WE'RE NOT
QUITE THERE YET.

27:37.827 --> 27:39.158
OH, JUST YOU WAIT.
IT'S LIKE, LEGOS, MAGNETS.

27:39.158 --> 27:40.359
REALLY?

27:40.359 --> 27:42.191
ANYTHING THAT IS
A CHOKING HAZARD, THEY FIND IT.

27:42.191 --> 27:43.863
JEEZ.
YEAH, WELL, LUCKY FOR US,

27:43.863 --> 27:45.835
THE E.R. IS RIGHT DOWNSTAIRS
FROM THE, UH, DAY CARE.

27:45.835 --> 27:47.336
YEAH, THAT'S FOR SURE.

27:47.336 --> 27:48.798
WAIT, ISN'T THAT CLOSING?

27:48.798 --> 27:50.199
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

27:50.199 --> 27:52.141
DERMATOLOGY HAS TWO FELLOWS.

27:52.141 --> 27:54.403
NOW IF WE COULD JUST CUT
ONE OF THEM...

27:54.403 --> 27:57.176
MAYBE WE COULD POSSIBLY...

27:57.176 --> 28:00.179
(keyboard keys clicking)

28:00.179 --> 28:03.182
(people speaking indistinctly)

28:05.114 --> 28:06.886
I HATE HER.

28:06.886 --> 28:08.687
WHO?

28:08.687 --> 28:10.359
MY INTERN.
WHY?

28:10.359 --> 28:11.861
LOOK AT HER, ALL MOPEY-FACED

28:11.861 --> 28:13.763
JUST 'CAUSE SHE DIDN'T GET
HER WAY.

28:13.763 --> 28:16.065
WE WERE NEVER MOPEY-FACED.
WE SUCKED IT UP.

28:16.065 --> 28:17.967
WHY AREN'T YOU
IN YOUR SKILLS LAB?

28:17.967 --> 28:19.769
OH, BECAUSE THE BABY KICKED.

28:19.769 --> 28:21.430
WOULDN'T STOP KICKING,
ACTUALLY.

28:21.430 --> 28:22.932
JERK.

28:22.932 --> 28:24.233
NO, IT'S GOOD. IT'S GREAT.
KICKING IS A GOOD THING.

28:24.233 --> 28:26.135
MAYBE I SHOULD KICK
MY INTERN.

28:26.135 --> 28:27.837
(elevator bell dings)

28:27.837 --> 28:30.139
MAYBE MY BABY'S KICKING
BECAUSE IT WANTS A GRANOLA BAR.

28:30.139 --> 28:32.711
THAT'S POSSIBLE.

28:32.711 --> 28:36.185
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

28:36.185 --> 28:38.387
(door hisses closed)

28:52.762 --> 28:55.765
♪♪♪

29:08.747 --> 29:11.851
(Bob) You want to stop
right there.

29:20.860 --> 29:21.931
YOU TRIED TO GIVE BLOOD
INSTEAD OF FLUIDS?

29:21.931 --> 29:23.893
HE'S NOT STUPID, YOU KNOW,
THE EYEBALL?

29:23.893 --> 29:25.965
He has eyes.
And a zoom lens.

29:25.965 --> 29:27.136
RICH IS CIRCLING THE DRAIN,

29:27.136 --> 29:28.467
AND HE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE.

29:28.467 --> 29:30.239
WE ARE GIVING HIM
EVERYTHING WE HAVE,

29:30.239 --> 29:31.901
JUST LIKE
THE FAMILY REQUESTED.

29:31.901 --> 29:33.973
YEAH, I KNOW.
AND THEY'RE PRAYING. AWESOME.

29:33.973 --> 29:36.806
YOU NEVER ADMINISTER ANYTHING
TO A PATIENT WITHOUT MY ORDERS.

29:36.806 --> 29:38.107
YOU THINK THAT BECAUSE YOU'VE
BEEN HERE ALL OF,

29:38.107 --> 29:39.909
WHAT, SIX MONTHS,
YOU KNOW EVERYTHING?

29:39.909 --> 29:41.250
YOU KNOW NOTHING.

29:41.250 --> 29:43.212
ON THE TIMELINE OF DOCTORING,
YOU ARE AN AMOEBA.

29:43.212 --> 29:45.114
I THOUGHT THAT
HE DESERVED A CHANCE.

29:45.114 --> 29:46.816
YOU HAVE PASSION. I GET IT.

29:46.816 --> 29:48.217
YOU STILL HAVE TO DO
WHAT I SAY.

29:48.217 --> 29:51.460
I AM YOUR BOSS AND I AM TRYING
TO SAVE THIS PATIENT'S LIFE.

29:51.460 --> 29:53.863
NOW GET OUT OF HERE.
YOU'RE OFF MY SERVICE.

29:53.863 --> 29:54.824
I JUST--

29:54.824 --> 29:56.165
NOW.

29:58.267 --> 29:59.969
I'M SORRY.

30:01.570 --> 30:04.173
(whirs)

30:04.173 --> 30:06.936
What are you gonna do,
get her fired?

30:06.936 --> 30:09.238
She didn't do anything.

30:09.238 --> 30:11.981
There's nothing to tell.

30:11.981 --> 30:13.582
SHE'S RIGHT, YOU KNOW?

30:13.582 --> 30:15.244
HE'S CIRCLING THE DRAIN.

30:15.244 --> 30:17.416
Yeah, I know.

30:19.949 --> 30:21.450
OKAY.

30:21.450 --> 30:22.922
(suction gurgling)

30:22.922 --> 30:24.393
READY?

30:24.393 --> 30:26.395
FINGERS CROSSED.

30:26.395 --> 30:27.897
YES.

30:27.897 --> 30:30.829
THE SUTURES WILL HOLD.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.301
THERE WILL BE NO BLOODBATH.

30:32.301 --> 30:33.562
OKAY, LET'S GO, DOCTOR.

30:33.562 --> 30:35.865
REMOVE YOUR CLAMPS.

30:35.865 --> 30:38.307
DR. CAHILL?

30:38.307 --> 30:41.310
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

30:48.477 --> 30:49.848
(chuckles)

30:49.848 --> 30:52.251
(laughs) OKAY.

30:52.251 --> 30:53.582
OKAY, GOOD.

30:53.582 --> 30:55.584
I-I-I TOTALLY WASN'T SURE
THAT WAS GONNA WORK.

30:55.584 --> 30:56.926
(laughs) I GET IT.
I GET IT.

30:56.926 --> 30:58.087
BUT YOU DID GREAT.

30:58.087 --> 30:59.228
I'D NEVER HAVE THOUGHT

30:59.228 --> 31:00.930
YOU'D SPENT
A DAY OUTSIDE OF AN O.R.

31:00.930 --> 31:04.393
OH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
(chuckles)

31:04.393 --> 31:06.495
