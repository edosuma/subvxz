17:04.691 --> 17:07.276
OF DOING BUSINESS.

17:09.278 --> 17:12.490

18:24.562 --> 18:27.481
THE BIG WOODEN PLANE BELONGS

18:24.562 --> 18:27.481

18:56.343 --> 18:59.263
WE HAVE AN INTERESTING IDEA.

18:59.263 --> 19:03.726
WE'RE LOOKING

18:59.263 --> 19:03.726
FOR, UM, A U.S. PARTNER --

19:03.726 --> 19:05.645
A FULL PARTNER.

19:09.690 --> 19:11.859
MY BOARD WOULD NEVER GO FOR IT.

19:11.859 --> 19:14.862
WELL, I MEAN, WE WOULDN'T WANT

19:11.859 --> 19:14.862
THE COMPANY TO KNOW. RIGHT?

19:14.862 --> 19:16.447
WE WOULDN'T WANT THEM TO KNOW

19:14.862 --> 19:16.447
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

19:16.447 --> 19:18.074
THEY GOT WIND OF THIS --

19:18.074 --> 19:20.118
THAT FOREIGN NATIONALS WERE

19:18.074 --> 19:20.118
INVOLVED IN SUCH A THING --

19:20.118 --> 19:22.078
THERE WOULD BE

19:20.118 --> 19:22.078
GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE.

19:22.078 --> 19:24.622
MUCH LIKE THEY INTERFERED

19:22.078 --> 19:24.622
WITH HUGHES.

19:24.622 --> 19:28.208
MUCH LIKE THEY INTERFERE

19:24.622 --> 19:28.208
WITH EVERYTHING THAT YOU DO.

19:28.208 --> 19:29.836
WE DON'T WANT THAT.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.423
TWO CONDITIONS...

19:34.423 --> 19:35.883
TO EVEN CONSIDER THIS.

19:35.883 --> 19:38.260
FIRST, I GET TO MEET THE BUYERS

19:35.883 --> 19:38.260
FACE TO FACE.

19:38.260 --> 19:40.013
I UNDERSTAND.

19:38.260 --> 19:40.013
ABSOLUTELY. THAT'S A GIVEN.

19:40.013 --> 19:41.597
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,

19:40.013 --> 19:41.597
A SIGN OF GOOD FAITH,

19:41.597 --> 19:43.349
PROBABLY A

19:41.597 --> 19:43.349
HALF-A-MILLION-DOLLAR BUY-IN,

19:43.349 --> 19:45.059
JUST SO THEY FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT.

19:45.059 --> 19:46.936
[ LAUGHS ] YOU EXPECT ME TO GIVE

19:45.059 --> 19:46.936
YOU THE MONEY JUST LIKE THAT?

19:46.936 --> 19:47.979
YOU'RE A FUNNY GUY.

19:47.979 --> 19:49.897
YOU'RE RIGHT. FORGET ABOUT THAT.

19:49.897 --> 19:52.025
NO. TELL YOU WHAT.

19:49.897 --> 19:52.025
OPEN UP A CASH ACCOUNT

19:49.897 --> 19:52.025
IN YOUR NAME, RIGHT? OKAY.

19:52.025 --> 19:54.360
THEN I'LL GET MY PEOPLE TO PUT

19:52.025 --> 19:54.360
THEIR MONEY INTO YOUR ACCOUNT.

19:54.360 --> 19:55.528
THEN YOU OWN THE PLANE.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.446
YOU BUY THE PLANE

19:55.528 --> 19:57.446
AND EVERYTHING,

19:57.446 --> 20:00.407
AND THEN YOU LOAN IT

19:57.446 --> 20:00.407
TO A MUSEUM OVERSEAS.

20:00.407 --> 20:03.452
THE PLANE WILL ALWAYS BE YOURS.

20:04.578 --> 20:09.083
SECOND, I GET TO FLY HER --

20:04.578 --> 20:09.083
NOBODY ELSE.

20:09.083 --> 20:13.754
WHEN SHE GETS TO HER NEW

20:09.083 --> 20:13.754
LOCATION, I GET TO TAKE HER UP.

20:13.754 --> 20:17.842
I GUARANTEE YOU,

20:13.754 --> 20:17.842
YOU WILL FLY THIS PLANE.

20:17.842 --> 20:19.426
[ LAUGHS ]

20:19.426 --> 20:21.428
THAT IS THE SCAM THAT I USED

20:21.428 --> 20:23.389
TO SELL THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE

20:21.428 --> 20:23.389
THE YEAR WE MET.

20:23.389 --> 20:24.891
YES. YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.893
THAT'S -- THAT'S WHY I DID IT.

20:26.893 --> 20:30.188
OH. THAT IS --

20:26.893 --> 20:30.188
THAT IS SO ROMANTIC.

20:30.188 --> 20:31.898
SO, WAIT, WAIT.

20:30.188 --> 20:31.898
LET ME GET IT --

20:31.898 --> 20:33.816
HE GIVES US THE INFORMATION

20:31.898 --> 20:33.816
TO TRANSFER OUR FUNDS IN.

20:33.816 --> 20:35.693
WE TAKE HIS MONEY OUT

20:33.816 --> 20:35.693
AND GIVE IT TO THE WIDOW.

20:35.693 --> 20:37.820
-DONE DEAL. IT'S NICE.

20:35.693 --> 20:37.820
-NO, BUT THAT STILL

20:35.693 --> 20:37.820
LEAVES THE MERGER.

20:37.820 --> 20:40.156
WE CAN'T LET HIM FLY PEOPLE

20:37.820 --> 20:40.156
AROUND IN HIS BROKE AIRPLANES.

20:40.156 --> 20:41.991
DO YOU HAVE THE DEAL MEMO?

20:41.991 --> 20:43.659
YEAH.

20:43.659 --> 20:45.452
ALL RIGHT.

20:45.452 --> 20:47.580
OKAY.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.082
OH, OKAY.

20:49.082 --> 20:50.624
WELL, HE DIDN'T ASSIGN A PROXY,

20:49.082 --> 20:50.624
MEANING THAT HE --

20:50.624 --> 20:52.960
IF HE'S NOT AT

20:50.624 --> 20:52.960
THE BOARD-OF-DIRECTORS MEETING,

20:52.960 --> 20:54.294
THE DEAL CAN'T GO THROUGH.

20:54.294 --> 20:55.629
SO WE HAVE TO DISTRACT HIM.

20:55.629 --> 20:57.131
AND I DON'T MEAN

20:55.629 --> 20:57.131
JUST, LIKE, TAKE HIM OUT,

20:57.131 --> 20:58.632
BUT I MEAN

20:57.131 --> 20:58.632
COMPLETELY DISCREDIT HIM.

20:58.632 --> 21:00.342
NOW, HE RELIES ON THE COMPANY

20:58.632 --> 21:00.342
TO PROTECT HIM,

21:00.342 --> 21:02.011
SO YOU STRIP THAT AWAY,

21:02.011 --> 21:03.721
CONSIDERING THE FACT

21:02.011 --> 21:03.721
THAT HE'S AN ENGINEER.

21:03.721 --> 21:05.347
SO YOU GIVE HIM A MYSTERY

21:03.721 --> 21:05.347
TO SOLVE.

21:05.347 --> 21:07.141
MM. HE'S GONNA OBSESS.

21:07.141 --> 21:08.893
YEAH, AND, YOU KNOW,

21:07.141 --> 21:08.893
HE LIKES TO TAKE RISKS.

21:08.893 --> 21:11.229
SO, UH -- AND HE WANTS

21:08.893 --> 21:11.229
TO BE LIKE HUGHES.

21:11.229 --> 21:13.022
YOU KNOW, I MEAN,

21:11.229 --> 21:13.022
HE WEARS THE SUITS,

21:13.022 --> 21:14.232
HE'S GOT THE HAT.

21:14.232 --> 21:15.399
AND HE'S IN LOVE...

21:26.953 --> 21:28.370
YEAH, HARDISON,

21:28.370 --> 21:31.290
YOU'RE GONNA NEED A FAKE I.D.

21:28.370 --> 21:31.290

21:39.048 --> 21:41.259
DID YOUR HUSBAND

21:39.048 --> 21:41.259
LEAVE ANYTHING BEHIND?

21:41.259 --> 21:43.844

21:52.228 --> 21:54.147
