they were already dead.

07:53.854 --> 07:55.521
What time was
the Kasden boy killed?

07:55.686 --> 07:58.166
According to court records,

07:58.191 --> 07:59.992
the Bennett home security
system fired the fatal shots

08:00.027 --> 08:02.328
- at 10:06pm.
- So the same house

08:21.882 --> 08:24.217
A lot of people were upset about the
acquittal, she was especially so.

08:24.251 --> 08:26.819
Made threatening remarks.
Stahl's gonna question her.

08:26.854 --> 08:29.322

into a system like this? - Doubt it.

08:29.356 --> 08:31.557

could've paid somebody.

08:31.592 --> 08:34.025
Yeah.

08:34.061 --> 08:36.128
Look, the reality is

09:07.127 --> 09:08.127

09:10.797 --> 09:13.466
Do you know who was
overriding your system?

09:13.500 --> 09:14.934
No.

09:14.968 --> 09:16.135
That information was erased.

09:16.170 --> 09:17.570
Do you have any recorded

09:17.604 --> 09:19.272
surveillance footage
from last night?

09:19.306 --> 09:21.507
No. Security cameras
were also erased.

09:21.542 --> 09:25.044
In the past 365 days,
did the Bennetts

09:25.078 --> 09:27.413

09:27.447 --> 09:30.516
The Bennetts received
56,312 threats.

09:30.551 --> 09:34.787
19,418 included
the threat of death.

09:34.822 --> 09:37.056
Can you show us your
security log, please.

09:45.165 --> 09:47.667
That's quite a list of suspects.

09:50.971 --> 09:53.973

10:01.081 --> 10:02.949
Yeah, but doesn't that

10:02.983 --> 10:04.617
No, it makes me think
it's personal.

10:04.651 --> 10:06.152
And we should

11:00.274 --> 11:02.308
Maybe you should apply.
With crime rates

11:02.342 --> 11:04.143
in the city on the rise,
kidnapping for ransom

11:04.144 --> 11:05.845
is up ten percent
just this year alone.

11:05.879 --> 11:07.513
With me,

11:07.548 --> 11:09.082
you get Synturion's
signature protection services

11:09.116 --> 11:12.485
with <i> you</i> wherever you go.

11:13.687 --> 11:16.756
"Wherever you go."

11:22.496 --> 11:24.997
Dorian?

11:28.635 --> 11:31.671
(child makes whooshing sound)

11:31.705 --> 11:33.506
Hey, Dorian?

11:33.540 --> 11:36.075
You okay?

11:36.110 --> 11:37.777
Yeah. Sorry.

11:42.947 --> 11:45.427
Detectives, this
is Peter Newsom,

11:45.452 --> 11:47.553
Synturion's in-house council.

11:47.588 --> 11:49.655
He's been with us
since I took the company public.

11:49.690 --> 11:52.592
Gentlemen, Synturion
has already launched

11:52.626 --> 11:53.960
a full-scale investigation

11:53.994 --> 11:55.361
into the deaths of Michael
and Linda Bennett,

11:55.396 --> 11:56.896
as I'm sure
Mrs. Stenson has

11:56.930 --> 11:58.398
already told you,
and we're willing to be

11:58.432 --> 12:00.566
completely transparent.
We've nothing to hide.

12:00.601 --> 12:03.136
All Peter is trying to say is,
no one wants to get

12:03.170 --> 12:05.571
to the bottom of the security
breach more than we do.

12:05.606 --> 12:07.340
We're expanding... rolling out
our first android model

12:07.374 --> 12:08.741
in less than a month.

12:08.776 --> 12:10.109
This is a critical time.

12:10.144 --> 12:11.878
Yeah, Sam told us.

12:11.912 --> 12:13.646
DORIAN: How do you protect
your clients from hackers?

12:13.680 --> 12:15.982
We use military grade
encryption software

12:16.016 --> 12:18.050
to decode algorithms
in real time.

12:18.085 --> 12:20.326
We use the same online security
they use at the Pentagon.

12:20.354 --> 12:21.988
The truth is, someone got in.

12:22.022 --> 12:23.723
Someone talented.

12:23.757 --> 12:25.191
I imagine you have
an employee in mind.

12:25.225 --> 12:26.626
NEWSOM: Is that an
accusation, Detective?

12:26.660 --> 12:28.094
All of Synturion's
programmers go

12:28.128 --> 12:29.862
through rigorous
background checks.

12:29.897 --> 12:31.777
If the suspect
can alter your code,

12:31.799 --> 12:33.566
and take over your
systems, do you think

12:33.600 --> 12:35.801
he'd have trouble getting around
your background checks?

12:35.803 --> 12:37.470
Detective, a lot
of people came after us

12:37.504 --> 12:38.671
after the Kasden verdict.

12:38.706 --> 12:39.939
Maybe that's because
they remember

12:39.973 --> 12:41.607
the day when a
reprimand for a kid

12:41.642 --> 12:44.911
sneaking over the back wall
was a yell out the window,

12:44.945 --> 12:47.847
not being killed by
laser-guided gunfire.

12:53.954 --> 12:57.557
I got into home security
because I was assaulted at 15.

12:57.591 --> 12:58.958
I was home alone.

12:58.992 --> 13:00.626
Three men came
into the house to rob us.

13:00.661 --> 13:03.262
I hid in the closet
and called the police.

13:03.297 --> 13:04.797
Just ten minutes.

13:04.832 --> 13:08.034
But in that time,
those men found me.

13:09.136 --> 13:11.370
I believe in the work
we're doing.

13:11.405 --> 13:14.173
We both want the same thing.

13:16.243 --> 13:18.544
You received a lot
of death threats

13:18.579 --> 13:21.147
and cyber attacks
at the time of the trial.

13:21.181 --> 13:24.984
Any one group or individual
stand out in particular?

13:25.018 --> 13:26.519
The group that was most vocal

13:26.553 --> 13:28.354
and aggressive
was called DISRUPT.

13:28.389 --> 13:31.124
After the Kasden trial,
they issued numerous denial

13:31.158 --> 13:32.492
of service attacks,
shutting down our servers.

13:32.526 --> 13:34.127
DORIAN: You think they'd
go as far as murder?

13:34.161 --> 13:36.896
Why not? They've gotten away
with everything else.

13:36.930 --> 13:38.698
Thank you for your time.

13:38.732 --> 13:42.035
Let us know if your internal
investigation uncovers anything.

13:52.880 --> 13:55.581
Thank you for stopping by,
Ms. Kasden.

13:55.616 --> 13:58.751
I'm sorry to have
to do this, but...

13:58.786 --> 14:01.054
you must have heard about
Michael and Linda Bennett.

14:01.088 --> 14:02.655
It's all over the news.

14:02.690 --> 14:04.590
The house killed them, too.

14:04.625 --> 14:06.693
Actually, we think
it was more than the house.

14:06.727 --> 14:08.528
We think someone hacked into
their security system

14:08.562 --> 14:10.697
and caused the malfunction
that led to their deaths.

14:10.731 --> 14:12.198
Where were you

14:12.232 --> 14:14.434
last night between
9:00 and 11:00 p.m.?

14:14.468 --> 14:17.437
I was at my church.

14:17.471 --> 14:20.940
There was a vigil
in my son's memory.

14:23.410 --> 14:25.478
I'm sorry to have to ask this,

14:25.512 --> 14:27.814
but were you online
at all during that time?

14:27.848 --> 14:30.049
Using any computerized devices?

14:30.084 --> 14:32.919
No. You can
ask anyone.

14:32.953 --> 14:37.290
I'm not a murderer, Detective,
or a hacker.

14:37.324 --> 14:40.259
I'm sorry for what happened
to Aaron.

14:42.229 --> 14:45.565
Those smart houses
should be against the law.

14:45.599 --> 14:47.567
That's why I went to trial.

14:47.601 --> 14:49.302
I thought,
if people knew the facts,

14:49.336 --> 14:51.571
they'd understand
how dangerous they were.

14:51.605 --> 14:54.107
That Synturion lawyer,

14:54.141 --> 14:56.943
Peter Newsom...
he lied about Aaron.

14:56.977 --> 14:59.245
He made him out
to be a criminal.

15:00.981 --> 15:03.750
Did you ever find out
why he was there that night?

15:03.784 --> 15:07.220
No.

15:07.254 --> 15:09.922
But I know
he didn't deserve to die for it.

15:09.957 --> 15:11.924
Ms. Kasden, we think

15:11.959 --> 15:14.494
whoever murdered the Bennetts
are using the anniversary

15:14.528 --> 15:17.764
of Aaron's death
to get revenge on his behalf.

15:17.798 --> 15:19.332
Do you know
of any of his friends

15:19.366 --> 15:22.268
that would be capable
of going to this extreme?

15:22.302 --> 15:24.904
No. Aaron didn't
have any friends.

15:24.938 --> 15:28.141
He spent a lot of time
alone on his computer.

15:28.175 --> 15:31.678
I wish people got the chance
to know him like I did.

15:33.604 --> 15:35.524
Do you still have
Aaron's computer?

15:35.549 --> 15:37.984
I'd like to take a look at it.

15:44.425 --> 15:48.428
Not that I mind, but
what's with the quiet mode?

15:51.332 --> 15:54.233
<i>Something happened</i>
<i>to you back there.</i>

15:54.268 --> 15:55.802
You, uh, want to share?

15:55.836 --> 15:57.437
It was strange.

15:57.471 --> 16:00.673
I had these images
in my head. Memories.

16:00.708 --> 16:03.676
I was lying in a bed,
playing with a toy train.

16:03.711 --> 16:05.712
Felt like me, but it wasn't.

16:06.847 --> 16:09.315
What do you mean? Why?

16:10.918 --> 16:13.619
Because I was a child, John.

16:17.114 --> 16:19.034
How is that...
how is that possible?

16:19.059 --> 16:20.760
I mean, you were never a kid.

16:20.794 --> 16:23.429
I know.

16:23.464 --> 16:25.598
I guess, whatever Rudy did

16:25.632 --> 16:27.834
when he was in my head
messed me up, man.

16:27.868 --> 16:30.403
I need to talk to him again.

16:34.408 --> 16:36.009
Dorian.

16:54.275 --> 16:55.977
Cyber Terrorism who called
DISRUPT,

16:56.008 --> 16:58.066
they're responsible for
the blackout.

16:58.098 --> 16:59.837
All the two grids are
back online.

16:59.878 --> 17:01.679
Cyber Terrorism believes
DISRUPT may be responsible

17:01.714 --> 17:04.048
for the smart house murder
of the couple yesterday.

17:04.083 --> 17:05.650
JOHN:
What's the connection?

17:05.684 --> 17:08.185
MALDONADO: We intercepted
this video from the Internet.

17:08.220 --> 17:10.288
(voice garbled): Tonight, we
took over the city's power grid

17:10.321 --> 17:12.757
to mark the anniversary
of the murder of Aaron Kasden,

17:12.790 --> 17:15.393
and to bring to light
companies like Synturion

17:15.426 --> 17:17.028
who are putting
dangerous technology

17:17.061 --> 17:18.930
into the hands of consumers
prematurely,

17:18.964 --> 17:20.964
and getting away with murder,
literally.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.067
And it's happened again.

17:23.102 --> 17:25.002
We will not stop our fight
against Synturion

17:25.037 --> 17:27.005
and others like them
who destroy lives

17:27.039 --> 17:28.639
in the name of profit.

17:28.674 --> 17:30.274
MALDONADO: DISRUPT has been on
the cyber terrorism watch list

17:30.309 --> 17:32.069
for the past four years.
We have every reason

17:32.077 --> 17:34.712
to believe they'll act
again, unless we stop them.

17:34.747 --> 17:36.581
VALERIE: We're already
contacting Synturion employees

17:36.615 --> 17:38.149
who live in smart houses

17:38.183 --> 17:40.918
and asking them to disable
their smart home security.

17:40.953 --> 17:42.687
JOHN:
How do we catch these guys?

17:42.721 --> 17:44.088
DISRUPT's members are anonymous.

17:44.123 --> 17:45.857
Do we have any leads
as to who specifically

17:45.891 --> 17:47.258
may have perpetrated the hack?

17:47.292 --> 17:48.960
MALDONADO:
The good news is: yes.

17:48.994 --> 17:50.528
Cyber terrorism was able

17:50.562 --> 17:52.497
to identify the handle of
the person responsible.

17:52.531 --> 17:56.467
CrispinX. The bad news is,
since their users are anonymous,

17:56.502 --> 17:57.802
we don't have a
name to go with it.

17:57.836 --> 17:59.537
We need to find a source.

17:59.571 --> 18:01.105
Someone who knows hackers.

18:04.340 --> 18:06.820
That is true. I was
quite a hacker,

18:06.845 --> 18:08.646
but those days are behind me.

18:08.681 --> 18:10.048
We don't want you
to hack anything.

18:10.082 --> 18:11.482
We just need your help.

18:11.517 --> 18:13.118
We're looking
for someone named CrispinX.

18:13.152 --> 18:15.653
- That sound familiar?
- Familiar?

18:15.688 --> 18:17.021
Kristen X...
that was one date,

18:17.056 --> 18:19.157
and I didn't know
I had to pay her.

18:19.191 --> 18:21.592
CrispinX.
The hacker?

18:21.627 --> 18:23.394
Oh. CrispinX.

18:23.429 --> 18:25.630
DORIAN: We believe the
person using this handle

18:25.664 --> 18:26.944
is responsible for
the blackouts.

18:26.966 --> 18:28.833
Yes. I knew it.

18:28.867 --> 18:30.501
Now, that sounds like CrispinX.

18:30.536 --> 18:32.870
Accessing the city's
server controls,

18:32.905 --> 18:35.306
hacking in real time. Oh.

18:35.341 --> 18:36.841
The showmanship of it.
It's classic.

18:36.875 --> 18:38.977
Classic way to get three
to six in the cubes.

18:39.011 --> 18:42.046
Longer, if he and DISRUPT
did the smart house murder.

18:42.081 --> 18:44.482
Uh, no. Crisp is
a cyber mercenary.

18:44.516 --> 18:46.217
He's not a member of DISRUPT.

18:46.251 --> 18:48.553
He's a hacker for hire.
One of the best, actually.

18:48.587 --> 18:50.321
In fact, it's kind of
a tradition.

18:50.356 --> 18:52.924
The night after a big hack,
everyone gathers together.

18:52.958 --> 18:55.059
It's the party of all parties.

18:55.094 --> 18:56.294
Pure hedonism.

18:56.328 --> 18:57.795
Wait a minute.
So, you're saying

18:57.830 --> 18:59.330
that he's at a party right now,

18:59.365 --> 19:01.065
and all we have
to do is find it?

19:01.100 --> 19:04.268
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I used to get
invited to them all the time.

19:04.303 --> 19:06.037
Well, sometimes.

19:06.071 --> 19:07.839
Uh, never actually been.

19:07.873 --> 19:09.507
JOHN:
Do you think you could get

19:09.541 --> 19:11.876
- yourself invited to this one?
- I could try.

19:11.910 --> 19:14.479
Can I pass as you,
using your old handle?

19:14.513 --> 19:16.514
Sure. It's "Aphid."

19:16.548 --> 19:18.983
- Aphid?
- Like the bug?

19:19.018 --> 19:21.452
They may be little,
but they're destructive.

19:21.487 --> 19:24.789
Ugh. You're gonna impress,
you're gonna need some cred.

19:24.823 --> 19:27.258
It might look like
just a tablet to you,

19:27.293 --> 19:29.060
but any pro will know
what you're packing.

19:29.094 --> 19:31.296
This is what I used
to use to hack on.

19:32.197 --> 19:34.299
It's, um...
Thank you.

19:34.333 --> 19:36.367
It's custom-built.

19:36.402 --> 19:37.769
Some of the parts
are really rare.

19:37.803 --> 19:39.037
I'll be very careful with it.

19:39.071 --> 19:41.072
If Crisp is involved
with DISRUPT,

19:41.106 --> 19:44.042
they may be there, and they're
obviously very dangerous.

19:44.076 --> 19:46.177
Okay. I'll go in

19:46.211 --> 19:47.745
as your backup.

19:47.780 --> 19:49.080
They'll know you're cops.

19:49.114 --> 19:51.582
These guys aren't amateurs.

19:51.617 --> 19:53.418
If you're gonna pull this off,
you can't go in there

19:53.452 --> 19:55.887
looking like that.

19:55.921 --> 19:59.057
(dance music playing)

20:00.459 --> 20:01.759
<i>It's not a sports bar, John.</i>

20:01.794 --> 20:03.561
<i>These people are explorers.</i>

20:03.595 --> 20:05.697
<i>They push boundaries...</i>

20:05.731 --> 20:08.533
<i>social boundaries,</i>
<i>sexual boundaries.</i>

20:08.567 --> 20:10.735
<i>Trust me,</i>
<i>if you want to blend in</i>

20:10.769 --> 20:14.272
<i>with the throng of undulating</i>
<i>bodies on the dance floor,</i>

20:14.306 --> 20:17.008
<i>you're gonna have</i>
<i>to look the part.</i>

20:19.178 --> 20:21.379
I can't hear anything.
Where is everybody?

20:21.413 --> 20:23.915
Probably scared them away
with your new look.

20:23.949 --> 20:25.783
MALDONADO:
That's the right place?

20:25.818 --> 20:27.118
VALERIE:
Rudy said he was sure.

20:27.152 --> 20:29.087
JOHN:
We got to keep going down.

20:29.121 --> 20:30.788
This place is huge.

20:30.823 --> 20:32.857
Be careful, John. Drones can't
get any thermal imaging.

20:32.891 --> 20:34.826
We've got three units
standing by.

20:34.860 --> 20:37.695
(dance music playing)

20:41.033 --> 20:43.635
(music playing
through headsets)

20:49.775 --> 20:53.495
VALERIE: They're all
in virtual reality.

20:59.418 --> 21:00.551
What do you got, John?

21:00.586 --> 21:01.819
JOHN:
This isn't a real party.

21:01.854 --> 21:03.955
It's just a bunch of VR geeks.

21:05.357 --> 21:06.658
What the hell, man?

21:06.692 --> 21:08.359
CrispinX?

21:08.394 --> 21:10.295
No.

21:10.329 --> 21:12.196
You guys aren't cops, are you?

21:12.231 --> 21:14.111
Do we look like cops?
Yeah, actually.

21:14.133 --> 21:15.166
With makeup.

21:15.200 --> 21:17.201
Where can we find CrispinX?

21:17.236 --> 21:19.971
That's nice gear.

21:20.005 --> 21:21.139
Tell you what, mate,

21:21.173 --> 21:23.908
you tell us where
to find CrispinX,

21:23.943 --> 21:26.644
and it's yours.

21:26.679 --> 21:27.979
Check in the back.

21:28.013 --> 21:29.647
Thanks.

21:33.536 --> 21:35.296
JOHN:
Second room is clear.

21:35.321 --> 21:37.088
I'm starting wonder
if this CrispinX guy

21:37.122 --> 21:38.756
is even real.

21:41.126 --> 21:42.694
Hey, mate.

21:42.728 --> 21:44.128
Where's CrispinX?

21:44.163 --> 21:45.496
I don't know.

21:45.531 --> 21:46.531
Nice outfit, though.

21:46.532 --> 21:47.632
Thanks.

21:47.666 --> 21:50.101
(quietly):
I'm gonna kill Rudy.

21:50.135 --> 21:51.903
Third room is clear.

21:51.937 --> 21:55.440
Don't bother sending any backup;
we're not gonna need it.

22:02.081 --> 22:04.749
MAN: I hear you're
looking for CrispinX.

22:05.885 --> 22:07.051
JOHN:
Is that you?

22:07.086 --> 22:08.653
Who wants to know?

22:08.687 --> 22:10.188
I'm Aphid.

22:10.222 --> 22:13.524
Aphid? Your hack of
Mamba 36 is legendary.

22:13.559 --> 22:16.861
It's great to finally
see you in the flesh.

22:17.730 --> 22:19.163
Call me Nico.

22:20.132 --> 22:22.133
Nico, you're under arrest.

22:30.375 --> 22:30.910
RUDY: <i> These are the images</i>

22:30.935 --> 22:33.170
- you saw in your flashes?
- DORIAN: Yes.

22:33.204 --> 22:34.471
What is it?

22:34.506 --> 22:36.073
My guess is,

22:36.107 --> 22:38.075
as you accumulate visual data,

22:38.109 --> 22:40.110
the surplus
can get reinterpreted

22:40.145 --> 22:42.846
by your neural network
into random images.

22:42.881 --> 22:45.482
But it felt like something
I <i> had</i> experienced.

22:45.517 --> 22:47.484
Like a memory.

22:47.519 --> 22:49.987
Well, you <i> have</i> experienced
some of it.

22:50.021 --> 22:52.623
Um, the objects in the room,
the toy train,

22:52.657 --> 22:56.093
for example, could be archived
in your recorded data

22:56.127 --> 22:57.795
from a case you were on.

22:57.829 --> 23:00.898
But your neural net has
created a context for it

23:00.932 --> 23:03.412
that you never
experienced it in.

23:03.435 --> 23:06.503
I have to run more tests
to know for sure.

23:07.803 --> 23:10.283
I probably shouldn't
admit this...

23:10.308 --> 23:13.110
uh, department policy
and all... but...

23:13.144 --> 23:15.412
when you were decommissioned,
I used to wake you up.

23:15.447 --> 23:17.367
Quite routinely, actually.
You and I

23:17.382 --> 23:19.350
kept each other
company; we had, uh,

23:19.384 --> 23:22.987
many spirited discussions
about... life,

23:23.021 --> 23:24.755
the world, all kinds of things.

23:24.789 --> 23:26.490
We did?

23:28.259 --> 23:29.727
What else did we do?

23:29.761 --> 23:32.229
Oh, just the-the usual:

23:32.263 --> 23:34.498
yodeling, holo chess,

23:34.532 --> 23:36.233
the whole mail-order
bride debacle...

23:36.267 --> 23:38.035
that cost a pretty penny.

23:38.069 --> 23:40.804
Why can't I remember
any of this?

23:40.839 --> 23:42.640
Well, when I learned
that you were being put

23:42.674 --> 23:45.142
back on active duty,
I had to erase the files.

23:45.176 --> 23:47.277
I must have missed
these, though.

23:47.312 --> 23:48.879
There they are.

23:48.913 --> 23:50.881
That should be all of them.

23:54.519 --> 23:57.221
Those memory files
of the conversations we had,

23:57.255 --> 23:58.956
do you still have them?

23:58.990 --> 24:01.325
Uh, they're probably
kicking around somewhere, yeah.

24:01.359 --> 24:03.093
I'd like them.

24:07.799 --> 24:09.333
Rudy...

24:09.367 --> 24:11.435
we <i> are</i> friends.

24:11.469 --> 24:14.872
You don't have
to keep things from me.

24:14.906 --> 24:16.573
Course.

24:31.056 --> 24:33.891
JOHN:
<i>Nico Galasso.</i>

24:33.925 --> 24:36.927
28. Two prior convictions
for unauthorized access

24:36.962 --> 24:39.563
of electronic information
and uploading of

24:39.597 --> 24:42.599
destructive transmissions
into a private network.

24:42.634 --> 24:45.402
This is your third violation
of the cyber terrorism statute.

24:45.437 --> 24:48.272
You're heading to the cubes.

24:48.306 --> 24:50.107
VALERIE: And, you know,
while you're sitting in lockup

24:50.141 --> 24:52.343
awaiting your hacking trial,
we'll be building a case

24:52.377 --> 24:54.478
against you for the murders
of Michael and Linda Bennett.

24:54.512 --> 24:56.046
I didn't murder anybody.

24:56.081 --> 24:58.015
DISRUPT hired me to hack
into the city grid

24:58.049 --> 25:00.384
to honor Aaron Kasden;
that's all I did.

25:00.418 --> 25:02.619
DISRUPT is not
about hurting people;

25:02.654 --> 25:04.455
it's about making a statement,

25:04.489 --> 25:05.622
civil disobedience.

25:05.657 --> 25:07.391
They're not murderers.

25:07.425 --> 25:08.692
They're protestors.

25:08.727 --> 25:10.127
Protestors?

25:10.161 --> 25:11.929
Protestors have the courage

25:11.963 --> 25:14.598
to stand out in front
for what they believe in,

25:14.633 --> 25:16.667
not hide behind
a computer screen.

25:16.701 --> 25:19.536
Kind of like using a smart house
to kill two people remotely.

25:19.571 --> 25:20.971
- Right?
- Look,

25:21.006 --> 25:22.406
I had nothing to do

25:22.440 --> 25:24.920
with those people
getting killed.

25:32.651 --> 25:35.131
There's been another murder.

25:41.926 --> 25:44.295
WOMAN:
I.D.'s been confirmed.

25:44.329 --> 25:46.664
Peter Newsom. Some
big shot lawyer.

25:46.698 --> 25:49.900
JOHN: Yeah. We met him
yesterday... he works

25:49.934 --> 25:52.002
for the Synturion Corporation.

25:52.037 --> 25:53.504
Petechial hemorrhaging
around the eyes,

25:53.538 --> 25:55.739
consistent with acute
respiratory failure.

25:55.774 --> 25:57.274
This is a Synturion smart home.

25:57.309 --> 25:58.742
It has a fire-safety feature.

25:58.777 --> 26:00.678
If a fire is detected,
the system scans

26:00.712 --> 26:02.012
for signs of life.

26:02.047 --> 26:03.647
If nothing living is found,

26:03.682 --> 26:06.183
the system seals
all the entrances and exits

26:06.217 --> 26:07.377
and sucks out all the oxygen.

26:07.385 --> 26:09.753
No oxygen, no fire.
Not bad,

26:09.788 --> 26:12.022
in theory.
DISRUPT strikes again.

26:12.057 --> 26:14.825
WOMAN: Hey, I heard Detective
Paul was in the hospital.

26:14.859 --> 26:16.327
What happened?

26:16.361 --> 26:18.729
Yeah. It was nasty.

26:18.763 --> 26:20.664
He got a, uh...

26:20.699 --> 26:23.534
infection from a sexbot.

26:23.568 --> 26:25.869
Apparently, you got to keep

26:25.904 --> 26:27.538
those things clean.

26:27.572 --> 26:29.673
Know what I mean?

26:30.542 --> 26:31.875
Really?

26:39.882 --> 26:42.362
Since the Bennett murder, his
system was taken off-line,

26:42.387 --> 26:43.854
but someone hacked in remotely

26:43.888 --> 26:46.657
and activated the fire
suppression at 5:08 p.m.

26:46.691 --> 26:49.360
Nico Galasso was
already in custody by then.

26:49.394 --> 26:51.095
He couldn't have done this.

26:51.129 --> 26:53.731
It had to be
someone else from DISRUPT.

26:53.765 --> 26:55.933
Maybe not.

26:56.765 --> 26:58.645
I saw this photo
at the Bennetts'.

26:58.670 --> 27:00.571
It arrived the day
they were murdered.

27:00.605 --> 27:03.107
They received a lot of death
threats that day. Yeah, I know,

27:03.141 --> 27:04.408
but take a closer look at it.

27:04.442 --> 27:06.176
It's not a stock shot
of Aaron Kasden,

27:06.211 --> 27:07.411
it's not a class photo,

27:07.445 --> 27:08.812
not something you
can see online.

27:08.847 --> 27:10.748
It's candid.

27:10.782 --> 27:13.183
John, this picture has a social
network tag that's been hidden

27:13.218 --> 27:15.552
in the coding...
I can't trace it.

27:15.587 --> 27:19.590
Whoever sent this photo
knew Aaron Kasden.

27:21.293 --> 27:24.662
This is your "get out
of jail free" card.

27:24.696 --> 27:26.530
Aaron Kasden's tablet.

27:26.564 --> 27:29.266
You want to make a deal?

27:29.301 --> 27:30.935
What'd you have in mind?

27:30.969 --> 27:32.102
Immunity,

27:32.137 --> 27:33.971
for your help
in locating a suspect

27:34.005 --> 27:35.272
in the Bennett
and Newsom murders.

27:35.307 --> 27:37.074
We believe that
whoever committed

27:37.108 --> 27:39.109
these murders
knew Aaron Kasden personally.

27:39.144 --> 27:40.778
Aaron's mom said he
didn't have many friends,

27:40.812 --> 27:42.513
but he spent a lot of time

27:42.547 --> 27:43.814
online.

27:43.848 --> 27:45.416
I've been going
through his computer

27:45.450 --> 27:47.490
and found half of this photo...
we need you

27:47.519 --> 27:49.086
to retrieve the
rest of this image.

27:49.120 --> 27:50.621
There's a social network
tag that's been hidden,

27:50.655 --> 27:52.423
and we can't find the link.

27:52.457 --> 27:54.525
That's probably because
you don't know how to look.

27:54.559 --> 27:58.362
Look, pal, you want to do
some good in Aaron's name,

27:58.396 --> 28:00.331
actually stand up
for what you believe in?

28:00.365 --> 28:03.167
Make the deal.

28:07.405 --> 28:09.773
(sighs)

28:09.808 --> 28:12.509
I'm gonna need
my own equipment.

28:13.678 --> 28:14.678
Set the transport.

28:14.713 --> 28:16.580
NICO:
<i>All right,</i>

28:16.615 --> 28:18.649
- here we go.
- VALERIE: What'd you find?

28:18.683 --> 28:20.251
Looks like
Aaron's got some files

28:20.285 --> 28:21.719
locked away in a virtual safe.

28:21.753 --> 28:23.854
Unless you're going over
the code manually,

28:23.888 --> 28:25.155
it's invisible.

28:25.190 --> 28:26.790
That's why you couldn't find it.

28:26.825 --> 28:27.992
What's in it?

28:28.026 --> 28:29.793
Something important.

28:29.828 --> 28:31.629
There's triple-shielded
encryption,

28:31.663 --> 28:34.164
armor-clad algorithm.

28:34.199 --> 28:35.733
It's decrypting now.

28:35.767 --> 28:37.835
Got it.

28:37.869 --> 28:38.969
Who's that girl?

28:40.171 --> 28:42.339
Her name is Emily Wilson.

28:42.374 --> 28:44.642
She's 18. And she was
expelled from school

28:44.676 --> 28:46.877
five years ago
for assaulting a classmate.

28:46.912 --> 28:49.647
Homeschooled ever since
by a holographic teacher.

28:49.681 --> 28:52.483
Aptitude test...
off the charts.

28:52.517 --> 28:54.018
She moved to Arizona
with her parents

28:54.052 --> 28:55.319
just after the Kasden killing.

28:55.353 --> 28:57.988
She was filed as
a missing person last month.

29:24.075 --> 29:28.445
I got to say, this Emily girl's
coding skills are incredible.

29:28.479 --> 29:30.313
She's as good as
any hacker I've ever seen.

29:30.348 --> 29:31.648
Yeah, and we need to find her.

29:31.682 --> 29:34.418
NICO: I said she was good,
not better than me.

29:34.452 --> 29:36.753
JOHN: Have you seen anything in
there that can help us locate her?

29:36.788 --> 29:39.423
Every hacker picks up
their own little bag of tricks...

29:39.457 --> 29:41.358
ways in, decoding methods.

29:41.392 --> 29:43.427
It's like a footprint...
if you can find one,

29:43.461 --> 29:45.162
then you can track
where they've been.

29:45.196 --> 29:47.531
Just a second.
Here we go.

29:47.565 --> 29:49.299
And... I'm in.

29:49.334 --> 29:50.867
Wait a minute.

29:50.902 --> 29:53.103
Bank details, security codes,

29:53.137 --> 29:55.205
calendars for the Bennetts.

29:55.239 --> 29:58.008
There's more. Here's
another sub-directory.

29:58.042 --> 30:00.677
DORIAN: That's the
CEO of Synturion.

30:00.712 --> 30:02.446
That's Kay Stenson.

30:08.319 --> 30:10.520
(phone ringing)

30:10.555 --> 30:12.222
Hello.

30:12.256 --> 30:15.359
Mrs. Stenson, this is
Detective Kennex. Where are you?

30:15.393 --> 30:17.234
Are you okay?
I'm in my office.

30:17.261 --> 30:19.262
Yeah. But I keep getting
the same threatening e-mail

30:19.297 --> 30:20.464
over and over again.

30:20.498 --> 30:21.631
What does it say?

30:21.666 --> 30:22.833
It's got a picture

30:22.867 --> 30:24.101
of Aaron Kasden, and it says:

30:24.135 --> 30:25.369
"Do you feel safe?"

30:25.403 --> 30:26.570
Okay, listen to me.

30:26.604 --> 30:27.804
Do not go home.
We're coming

30:27.839 --> 30:29.072
to get you.
What's going on?

30:29.107 --> 30:30.207
We think we know who's

30:30.241 --> 30:31.208
been hacking your systems.

30:31.242 --> 30:32.309
Her name is Emily.

30:32.343 --> 30:33.510
She was a friend of Aaron's.

30:33.544 --> 30:35.479
You may be her next target.

30:35.513 --> 30:36.947
Just lock down
the building, okay?

30:36.981 --> 30:38.348
We're only a few minutes out.

30:38.383 --> 30:40.017
(siren wailing)

30:46.724 --> 30:48.025
(beep)

30:57.301 --> 30:59.436
NICO:
We've got a problem.

30:59.470 --> 31:01.138
I followed Emily's footprint,
and she's hacked

31:01.172 --> 31:02.606
into Synturion's server.

31:02.640 --> 31:03.807
And?
She's running

31:03.841 --> 31:06.076
manual overrides
on multiple systems.

31:06.110 --> 31:07.077
Can you stop her?

31:07.111 --> 31:08.812
Yes.

31:12.954 --> 31:15.595
NICO: <i> Kay just entered
her employee I.D.</i>

31:15.620 --> 31:18.088
Emily's locked her out.

31:22.527 --> 31:24.995
I think I can override it.

31:34.569 --> 31:36.449
She's tapped
into the main server.

31:36.474 --> 31:38.008
She's on-site.

31:38.042 --> 31:39.676
Emily Wilson's at Synturion?

31:42.647 --> 31:44.381
Okay, we're on-site.

31:44.415 --> 31:47.284
VALERIE: Emily's hacked
the Synturion security system.

31:47.318 --> 31:50.921
She's going after Kay Stenson
inside the building.

31:54.959 --> 31:58.628
John, she has control of all the
systems, including life support.

31:58.663 --> 32:01.503
JOHN: We're at the front entrance.
Can you get us in?

32:02.667 --> 32:04.067
You're in.

32:04.102 --> 32:05.802
(beep)

32:17.281 --> 32:19.516
Do we have a location
on Kay Stenson yet?

32:19.550 --> 32:21.518
She's on the third floor,
east wing.

32:21.552 --> 32:22.919
Be careful.
The Wilson girl is

32:22.954 --> 32:24.621
controlling the Synturion bot
remotely.

32:24.656 --> 32:27.136
Get the server.
I'll get Kay.

32:49.480 --> 32:52.316
She's still controlling
all the systems.

32:52.350 --> 32:55.085
But I've found another way
to get in.

32:55.119 --> 32:57.020
(whirring)

33:00.858 --> 33:02.426
(chuckles)

33:06.164 --> 33:08.732
She definitely knows
I've hacked in now.

33:08.766 --> 33:12.536
I don't know how long
I can shut her out for.

33:40.331 --> 33:43.233
(whirring)

33:50.842 --> 33:54.845
Uh, she just activated
all the Sam androids

33:54.879 --> 33:56.280
and the fire suppression system.

33:56.314 --> 33:59.383
You have five minutes,
and then no oxygen.

34:07.039 --> 34:09.540
MALE VOICE (over speaker):
Fire suppression activated.

34:09.574 --> 34:13.411
Four minutes
until oxygen system shutdown.

34:19.342 --> 34:23.063
VALERIE: John, Emily's moving
the Sam bots to your position.

34:23.088 --> 34:26.489
Hello. I'm Sam,
your holographic butler.

34:26.525 --> 34:27.757
As Synturion's...

34:27.793 --> 34:29.927
(door opens) (gasps)

34:38.370 --> 34:40.638
Emily Wilson,

34:40.672 --> 34:43.074
drop the tablet
and put your hands up.

34:43.108 --> 34:44.507
Good evening.

34:44.543 --> 34:45.309
Back up.

34:45.344 --> 34:46.710
(gunshot)

34:53.385 --> 34:55.186
Hello, I'm Sam...

34:55.219 --> 34:58.060
JOHN: There are holo
projectors all over the place.

34:59.858 --> 35:01.959
Nico, can you access
the holo-system?

35:01.994 --> 35:05.329
Let's put the odds in my favor
against all these Sam bots.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.201
Yeah, I'm in.

35:10.235 --> 35:11.669
I like where this is going.

35:11.703 --> 35:13.971
Give me a second to calibrate
your location.

35:35.093 --> 35:36.427
Anytime, Nico.

35:36.461 --> 35:38.195
I'm working on it.

35:38.230 --> 35:39.730
(beep)

35:43.819 --> 35:45.779
Looks like there are two
on the bridge.

35:45.804 --> 35:47.038
I see them.

35:47.072 --> 35:48.339
Now would be good.

35:48.373 --> 35:50.274
I think I got it.

35:58.467 --> 36:00.427
Thank you for that.
(chuckles) Yeah.

36:00.452 --> 36:02.520
No problem.
This is awesome.

36:02.554 --> 36:04.956
So much better
than virtual reality.

36:04.990 --> 36:06.857
Yeah, it's only virtual
for one of us.

36:06.892 --> 36:10.728
VALERIE: John, there are two more
active Sam bots in the building.

36:34.586 --> 36:37.121
(grunts, gasping)

36:37.155 --> 36:38.823
(choking)

36:38.857 --> 36:40.391
(gunshots)

36:41.894 --> 36:44.028
MALE VOICE:
Fire suppression activated.

36:44.062 --> 36:47.932
One minute
until oxygen system shutdown.

36:47.966 --> 36:49.867
JOHN:
I've got Kay. She's safe.

36:49.902 --> 36:51.269
You just took out the last one.

36:51.303 --> 36:52.603
Nice work, John.

36:52.638 --> 36:54.572
Nico, we'd like
to keep breathing here,

36:54.606 --> 36:56.741
if you don't mind.
Yeah, I know, I know.

36:56.775 --> 36:58.309
I'm trying.

37:03.282 --> 37:05.762
I'm not the monster
you think I am.

37:05.784 --> 37:07.785
Put the gun down, Emily.

37:10.386 --> 37:12.866
You're a DRN android; your
programming won't let me

37:12.891 --> 37:15.927
take my own life,
so back off or I will.

37:23.936 --> 37:25.303
Emily, it's over.

37:25.337 --> 37:27.104
How do you know my name?

37:27.139 --> 37:31.342
Aaron kept a log
of his online conversations.

37:31.376 --> 37:33.344
What do you know about Aaron?

37:33.378 --> 37:37.148
Based on your communications,
I know you're in love with him.

37:37.182 --> 37:39.116
I know he cared about you.

37:39.151 --> 37:41.485
I know he kept your picture,

37:41.520 --> 37:44.522
the one of you two together.

37:46.158 --> 37:50.127
He was the only person I had,
and they took him away from me.

37:51.697 --> 37:53.697
DORIAN:
I know why you're angry, Emily.

37:53.699 --> 37:56.467
You can see now that killing
the Bennetts and Peter Newsom

37:56.501 --> 37:58.669
will not bring Aaron back.

38:06.545 --> 38:08.646
Give me the gun.

38:10.346 --> 38:12.826
The oxygen is about
to be shut down.

38:12.851 --> 38:14.518
You better go and
get your friend.

38:14.553 --> 38:17.033
Don't waste your time on me.

38:20.225 --> 38:22.593
Emily, the gun.

38:26.465 --> 38:28.332
Please.

38:32.905 --> 38:35.006
(exhales)

38:35.040 --> 38:39.043
MALE VOICE: Oxygen system
shutdown deactivated.

38:39.077 --> 38:42.380
(voice breaking):
He was coming to see me.

38:43.652 --> 38:45.692
That's why he was
in the yard that night.

38:45.717 --> 38:48.085
He was coming to see me.

38:48.120 --> 38:50.254
(crying)

39:00.632 --> 39:01.866
Captain Maldonado?

39:01.900 --> 39:03.401
What can I help you
with, Officer?

39:03.435 --> 39:07.672
Um... this is
for Detective Paul.

39:07.706 --> 39:10.174
Um, some of the guys in patrol

39:10.208 --> 39:12.643
collected some money
for his recovery.

39:12.678 --> 39:14.679
It's for his donut pillow

39:14.713 --> 39:17.415
and wh-whatever else
he needs after his surgery.

39:17.449 --> 39:19.216
Surgery?
Yeah, for his...

39:19.251 --> 39:20.585
hemorrhoids, ma'am.

39:20.619 --> 39:21.852
Who told you that?

39:21.887 --> 39:23.688
It was, uh, Detective Kennex.

39:23.722 --> 39:26.924
Detective Paul took his mother
to Mexico for her birthday.

39:26.959 --> 39:28.326
He'll be back Tuesday.

39:28.360 --> 39:30.061
So t-take that back
to the guys.

39:30.095 --> 39:32.296
Thank you. I don't know
what you're talking about.

39:38.203 --> 39:40.137
Thank you for coming by.

39:40.172 --> 39:42.440
What's this about?
I wanted you to know

39:42.474 --> 39:44.141
we made an arrest.

39:46.345 --> 39:48.846
This is Emily Wilson.

39:48.880 --> 39:51.616
She lived in the same
neighborhood as the Bennetts.

39:51.650 --> 39:54.785
Aaron was on his way to see her
the night he was killed.

39:54.820 --> 39:56.754
You said this girl
killed people.

39:56.788 --> 39:59.490
Why would my son
be going to see her?

39:59.524 --> 40:01.859
I think he saw someone
who needed help

40:01.893 --> 40:04.295
and who was estranged
from society

40:04.329 --> 40:05.696
and her relationships,

40:05.731 --> 40:09.166
and I think he wanted
to connect with her,

40:09.201 --> 40:11.969
let her know she wasn't alone.

40:14.306 --> 40:18.009
Each one of those images is
a message from somebody he knew.

40:18.043 --> 40:22.446
It was set up by all the people
Aaron had connected with online.

40:26.084 --> 40:29.487
Your son wasn't alone,
Ms. Kasden.

40:29.521 --> 40:33.724
In the short time he was here,
he touched a lot of lives.

40:39.498 --> 40:42.667
I noticed an irregularity
in Dorian's diagnostics.

40:42.701 --> 40:44.835
When I looked into it,
I found these.

40:44.870 --> 40:49.440
They're shadow files, embedded
deep in his processing core.

40:49.474 --> 40:52.143
I extracted them while he was
powered down and charging.

40:52.177 --> 40:53.811
Is this what caused
his flash today?

40:53.845 --> 40:55.079
Yeah.

40:55.113 --> 40:56.480
I lied to him.

40:56.515 --> 40:59.050
I told him
it wasn't a big deal, but...

40:59.084 --> 41:01.319
this isn't recorded data.

41:01.353 --> 41:04.555
These are memories,
like you or I would have.

41:04.589 --> 41:06.324
They're organic.

41:06.358 --> 41:07.325
Human.

41:07.359 --> 41:09.193
JOHN:
Memories?

41:09.227 --> 41:11.028
Somebody put them in there;
and it looks like

41:11.063 --> 41:12.430
they've been there
for a long time,

41:12.464 --> 41:14.365
before he was reactivated.

41:14.399 --> 41:15.967
- Is he in any danger?
- I've removed them all,

41:16.001 --> 41:18.336
and I've closed
the insertion point

41:18.370 --> 41:19.904
so that whoever did this

41:19.938 --> 41:22.773
won't be able to access him
in the same way again.

41:32.117 --> 41:34.218
- We need to tell him.
- No.

41:34.253 --> 41:35.686
We can't tell anyone,

41:35.721 --> 41:36.921
not until I've figured out
what's going on.

41:36.955 --> 41:39.023
If this gets out,
people will think that

41:39.057 --> 41:41.225
he's malfunctioning
like the other DRNs,

41:41.260 --> 41:42.893
and they could decommission him.

41:44.527 --> 41:47.007
What do you want me to do?

41:47.032 --> 41:49.033
You need to keep an eye on him,
John; we both do.

41:49.067 --> 41:51.002
I'll be monitoring
his systems, but...

41:51.036 --> 41:52.877
if this happens again,
if he mentions anything,

41:52.904 --> 41:54.238
you need to tell me.

41:54.273 --> 41:55.640
Somebody planted these images

41:55.674 --> 41:57.441
in Dorian's head for a reason.

41:57.476 --> 41:59.110
We need to find out why.
