00:02.535 --> 00:03.602
- Hi.

00:03.604 --> 00:04.603
- Hi, marie.

00:04.605 --> 00:06.405
- [sniffing]
ooh, what--

00:06.407 --> 00:09.208
Oh, another dinner
get away from you, dear?

00:12.579 --> 00:14.246
- It's burnt popcorn, marie.

00:14.248 --> 00:18.283
- Oh, popcorn for dinner.
How fun.

00:18.285 --> 00:19.685
- No, it wasn't for dinner,
and I didn't--

00:19.687 --> 00:21.653
- Amy! Oh!
- Marie! Oh!

00:21.655 --> 00:23.589
- Oh, honey!
- Hi!

00:23.591 --> 00:25.090
Look, look,
I'm wearing the pin.

00:25.092 --> 00:26.458
- Oh, it looks great
on you, honey.

00:26.460 --> 00:29.495
- Thanks, and thank you so much
for lunch yesterday.

00:29.497 --> 00:31.563
Marie is such a life saver.

00:31.565 --> 00:33.399
- Oh, stop it.
A life saver?

00:33.401 --> 00:34.767
- You brought me lunch at work.

00:34.769 --> 00:36.235
- Oh, honey, it was nothing.

00:36.237 --> 00:38.270
- "it was nothing."
you made your own mustard.

00:38.272 --> 00:40.606
- Well, you deserve it.

00:40.608 --> 00:42.174
- Will you look at my gals?

00:42.176 --> 00:45.044
I call them the two musketeers.

00:45.046 --> 00:48.447
- That's stupid.

00:48.449 --> 00:50.249
- Okay, you know, honey,

00:50.251 --> 00:53.652
Would you like to come
and have a cup of coffee?

00:53.654 --> 00:55.421
- Oh, great.

00:55.423 --> 00:57.256
Deb, you want to go
get some coffee?

00:57.258 --> 00:58.557
- Uh, no, I can't.
I have to--

00:58.559 --> 01:01.660
- She has to take care
of that smell.

01:01.662 --> 01:03.162
- Right this way, my ladies.

01:03.164 --> 01:05.130
Both: Oh, thank you.

01:05.132 --> 01:08.133
[all laughing]

01:16.676 --> 01:18.610
- What the hell was that?

01:26.453 --> 01:29.121
- All right.

01:29.123 --> 01:30.856
Ma wants to get the kitchen
in good shape.

01:30.858 --> 01:33.292
She's letting amy
cook dinner here Friday night.

01:33.294 --> 01:35.461
You and debra
are cordially invited.

01:35.463 --> 01:36.662
- Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

01:36.664 --> 01:38.664
Mom's letting amy
use her kitchen?

01:38.666 --> 01:40.332
- That's right.

01:40.334 --> 01:42.768
I don't have to tell you
what a big deal this is, do I?

01:42.770 --> 01:46.572
'cause it's huge.

01:46.574 --> 01:48.273
- It's not huge, robert.

01:48.275 --> 01:50.476
- Mom has never let anybody
cook in her kitchen.

01:50.478 --> 01:53.312
Nobody.

01:53.314 --> 01:55.547
- Oh, what's that
supposed to mean?

01:55.549 --> 01:56.615
- Nothing.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.684
It's just I'm excited
for amy.

01:58.686 --> 02:02.287
And this is the first-year
anniversary of us going out.

02:02.289 --> 02:04.656
- You know, debra
has cooked here, my friend.

02:04.658 --> 02:08.393
- Mm, no, she has not.

02:08.395 --> 02:09.628
- She has too.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.530
- No, sir.
- She has too, you freak.

02:11.532 --> 02:14.500
- You're the freak!
Dad? Dad?

02:14.502 --> 02:16.902
- Ow!

02:16.904 --> 02:19.771
- Has ma ever let debra
cook in her kitchen?

02:19.773 --> 02:21.807
- I'm not getting involved
in your stupid argument.

02:21.809 --> 02:23.542
Your mother likes amy
better than debra.

02:23.544 --> 02:25.277
End of story.

02:25.279 --> 02:28.147
Hold that up.

02:28.149 --> 02:30.215
- Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.
Wait a minute.

02:30.217 --> 02:32.651
What?
Who told you that?

02:32.653 --> 02:34.553
- Your mother!

02:34.555 --> 02:39.558
Don't go blabbing that.
She said it was a secret.

02:39.560 --> 02:42.461
- Well, what does she mean
she likes her more?

02:42.463 --> 02:45.464
- Oh, they're very close.
You know, they talk every day.

02:45.466 --> 02:47.566
- Every day?
What about yesterday?

02:47.568 --> 02:50.736
- Was yesterday a day?

02:50.738 --> 02:52.237
Every day

02:52.239 --> 02:53.839
For hours.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.674
- It's true.

02:55.676 --> 02:58.177
Amy talks her out.

02:58.179 --> 02:59.811
Marie sometimes goes days

02:59.813 --> 03:04.616
Without having
to say a word to me.

03:04.618 --> 03:07.219
I love amy.

03:11.691 --> 03:13.859
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.594
Your dad okay?

03:15.596 --> 03:17.563
- Yes.

03:21.467 --> 03:23.335
Hey, did you know that amy's

03:23.337 --> 03:26.205
Cooking a big dinner
over there Friday?

03:26.207 --> 03:27.239
- For their
anniversary thing?

03:27.241 --> 03:28.774
- Yeah.
Yeah, amy's cooking.

03:28.776 --> 03:30.976
In my mom's kitchen.

03:30.978 --> 03:32.511
You've cooked over there
before, right?

03:35.882 --> 03:37.549
- What, are you kidding me?

03:37.551 --> 03:42.487
Marie doesn't even like me
cooking over here.

03:42.489 --> 03:44.389
- Can we turn the tv off,
please, huh?

03:44.391 --> 03:47.626
Does the tv always
have to be on?

03:47.628 --> 03:49.294
- What's wrong with you?

03:49.296 --> 03:50.696
- Nothing.

03:50.698 --> 03:52.631
Can't we just talk?

03:52.633 --> 03:55.867
- Okay, now you're scaring me.

03:55.869 --> 03:57.869
- You don't wish that you could
cook over there sometime, huh?

03:57.871 --> 04:00.439
That wouldn't be fun?

04:00.441 --> 04:02.007
- Um...

04:05.578 --> 04:07.512
That might be the dumbest thing
you've ever said.

04:07.514 --> 04:08.780
Give me the remote.

04:08.782 --> 04:10.616
- No, no, no.
No tv.

04:10.618 --> 04:11.950
- Ray, come on,
what are you doing?

04:11.952 --> 04:14.786
This is stupid!
- It isn't stupid!

04:14.788 --> 04:17.723
- You give me--I don't care what
your mom does with amy, okay?

04:17.725 --> 04:20.259
- No!
No!

04:20.261 --> 04:21.760
- Ray, I'm watching the tv!

04:21.762 --> 04:23.662
- She likes amy more than you!

04:26.499 --> 04:27.766
- What?

04:27.768 --> 04:29.801
- Yeah, that's what
she told my dad.

04:29.803 --> 04:31.536
- She did?

04:31.538 --> 04:34.973
- Yes, and then he
told me and robert.

04:34.975 --> 04:36.842
Oh, and don't go
telling anybody, all right?

04:36.844 --> 04:38.410
It's a secret.

04:42.415 --> 04:44.416
- Okay, I won't.

04:44.418 --> 04:45.717
Why do you care?

04:45.719 --> 04:47.419
- I don't care.

04:47.421 --> 04:50.455
Robert's the one
who was acting all cocky.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.758
"amy's cooking.
Ah."

04:56.496 --> 04:59.731
- What, is this, like, some kind
of competition between you two?

04:59.733 --> 05:00.766
- No!
What--

05:00.768 --> 05:03.568
- Oh, my god.
It is!

05:03.570 --> 05:05.604
Oh, you can't stand it
that your mommy

05:05.606 --> 05:07.806
Likes robbie's girl
better than your girl.

05:10.877 --> 05:13.712
- I'm a little
insulted by that.

05:13.714 --> 05:15.047
- You're insulted?

05:15.049 --> 05:18.016
I'm just this thing
in your stupid sibling rivalry.

05:18.018 --> 05:20.552
- There is no rivalry.
- Oh, no?

05:20.554 --> 05:22.387
Robbie's got
the better girl, ray.

05:22.389 --> 05:25.924
We're behind.
What are we gonna do?

05:25.926 --> 05:27.526
- Where you going?

05:27.528 --> 05:29.428
- Well, I've got
a lot of work to do.

05:29.430 --> 05:31.029
There's
the evening gown competition.

05:31.031 --> 05:34.666
There's swimsuit competition.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.401
Oh, my god,
talent competition.

05:36.403 --> 05:37.969
What should I do,
twirl or sing?

05:37.971 --> 05:40.105
I know!
I'll do both.

05:40.107 --> 05:42.841
[singing]
one, singular sensation

05:42.843 --> 05:45.777
Every little
step she takes

05:45.779 --> 05:47.412
One

05:47.414 --> 05:49.114
Thrilling combination

05:49.116 --> 05:51.750
Every move that she makes

05:51.752 --> 05:53.452
Idiot.

05:58.358 --> 06:01.893
- Nice.
Very nice.

06:01.895 --> 06:03.762
Nice attitude.

06:03.764 --> 06:06.765
Forget about miss congeniality,
that's for sure.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.771
I'm not an idiot.

06:16.008 --> 06:17.676
- Hi, raymond.

06:17.678 --> 06:20.045
Listen, on Friday,
amy's gonna cook--

06:20.047 --> 06:20.846
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

06:20.848 --> 06:22.114
Robert just told me.

06:22.116 --> 06:23.115
- Oh, good.
So you'll be there?

06:23.117 --> 06:26.017
Oh, robbie is so excited.

06:26.019 --> 06:27.786
- Yeah, that's nice for him.
Listen, ma...

06:27.788 --> 06:29.955
- What?
- I want to ask you something.

06:29.957 --> 06:31.990
Sit down.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.759
- All right.

06:38.431 --> 06:40.031
- Why do you like amy
more than debra?

06:40.033 --> 06:41.700
- What?

06:41.702 --> 06:43.402
- Yeah, dad told me.
Dad told me that you liked--

06:43.404 --> 06:46.571
- He's lying.

06:46.573 --> 06:50.809
- Did you say that you like amy
more than debra?

06:50.811 --> 06:54.479
- I am not

06:54.481 --> 06:56.548
Saying that.

06:59.719 --> 07:02.754
- What?

07:02.756 --> 07:10.028
- I am not saying
that I like amy more than debra.

07:10.030 --> 07:13.965
- I know.
I know you're not saying it now.

07:13.967 --> 07:17.436
But did you say it ever?

07:22.742 --> 07:25.076
What if I told you
that we have a tape

07:25.078 --> 07:27.012
Of you saying it, ma?

07:32.952 --> 07:35.220
- Give me the tape.

07:35.222 --> 07:37.856
- Yeah.
There is no tape.

07:37.858 --> 07:39.958
- Well, then you don't have
any proof at all.

07:39.960 --> 07:43.495
- Wait. Wait, mom. Why?
Why did you tell dad that?

07:43.497 --> 07:45.864
- It was supposed
to be a secret.

07:45.866 --> 07:48.200
I'm never gonna talk
to that man again.

07:48.202 --> 07:50.001
- Why don't you like debra?

07:50.003 --> 07:53.104
- Honey, I love debra.

07:53.106 --> 07:56.241
No, it's just that amy and I
get along so well.

07:56.243 --> 07:59.711
She's a very nice girl,
you know?

07:59.713 --> 08:01.813
- Well, so is debra.
Debra's nice.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.682
- No, I don't mean
nice like that.

08:03.684 --> 08:04.883
- Well, what?

08:04.885 --> 08:11.623
- I mean, amy is a very nice
and very good--

08:11.625 --> 08:15.126
She's a very good girl.

08:15.128 --> 08:17.629
- So is debra.

08:17.631 --> 08:20.966
- No.
Good pure.

08:23.636 --> 08:24.569
- Pure?

08:27.974 --> 08:31.009
Whoa, wait.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.777
Wait!
What?

08:32.779 --> 08:34.813
Pure as in amy has never--

08:34.815 --> 08:38.617
- Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh--

08:38.619 --> 08:43.522
I was supposed
to keep that a secret.

08:43.524 --> 08:46.758
- What?
Amy is a good girl?

08:46.760 --> 08:51.096
But she's 33 years old, ma.
She can't be.

08:51.098 --> 08:52.531
- She can't?

08:52.533 --> 08:54.299
- I mean, yeah, she can,
but how?

08:54.301 --> 08:55.800
It's so...

08:55.802 --> 08:59.304
- Refreshing?

08:59.306 --> 09:02.874
- Wow, I don't believe it.

09:02.876 --> 09:06.912
So amy's never let anybody
cook in her kitchen either.

09:11.551 --> 09:14.853
- I don't like that, raymond.

09:14.855 --> 09:15.954
- Well, wait a minute.

09:15.956 --> 09:18.890
Why is amy's goodness
such a big deal?

09:18.892 --> 09:20.959
- Because it tells me
about her character,

09:20.961 --> 09:23.028
The kind of person she is.

09:23.030 --> 09:24.896
See, I think robert
is very lucky

09:24.898 --> 09:26.898
To find a girl like that.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.234
- How do you know
that I wasn't lucky too?

09:29.236 --> 09:30.569
- What are you saying?

09:30.571 --> 09:32.203
- How do you know
that debra wasn't,

09:32.205 --> 09:34.239
You know,
when we got married?

09:34.241 --> 09:37.609
- You mean debra
was a good girl?

09:51.123 --> 09:55.093
- Listen, my mom was just here,
and we were talking,

09:55.095 --> 09:56.761
And it hit me.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.630
I was,
I was being competitive

09:58.632 --> 10:02.334
About amy and robert
and my mom, and

10:02.336 --> 10:04.035
I'm sorry,

10:04.037 --> 10:05.036
Really sorry.

10:05.038 --> 10:06.036
- All right.

10:06.038 --> 10:09.040
I mean, you know, who cares
what your mom thinks?

10:09.042 --> 10:10.809
- You're right.

10:10.811 --> 10:12.377
You are.
You're right.

10:12.379 --> 10:15.113
In fact, you should
hear the reason

10:15.115 --> 10:17.148
Why she likes amy
more than you.

10:17.150 --> 10:20.352
Oh.
[laughs]

10:20.354 --> 10:22.854
Oh, man.
She's nuts, that lady.

10:22.856 --> 10:24.889
- Why? What?
What did she say?

10:24.891 --> 10:25.957
- Well, first of all,

10:25.959 --> 10:29.094
Did you know
that amy has never--

10:29.096 --> 10:32.797
[clicking tongue]

10:32.799 --> 10:35.634
Huh?
She's saving up for later.

10:35.636 --> 10:37.268
- That's supposed
to be a secret.

10:37.270 --> 10:40.372
Who told you that?
- My mom.

10:40.374 --> 10:42.941
- She did?
- Yeah, can you believe it?

10:42.943 --> 10:45.977
That's it!
That's her whole reason.

10:45.979 --> 10:49.080
- Because amy's a--
- good girl. Good girl.

10:49.082 --> 10:51.349
That's what she's calling her,
a good girl.

10:51.351 --> 10:54.285
- Oh, my god.

10:54.287 --> 10:57.288
- It's so shallow.

10:57.290 --> 10:59.024
- What can I do?

10:59.026 --> 11:00.992
I can't exactly compete with amy
in that department.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.895
You know,
you can't un-ring a bell.

11:03.897 --> 11:06.698
[both laughing]

11:08.968 --> 11:10.301
Oh.
- Nope.

11:10.303 --> 11:11.770
You know what I did?

11:11.772 --> 11:14.205
I told my mother
that you were a good girl too.

11:14.207 --> 11:17.709
[laughs]

11:17.711 --> 11:19.944
[both laugh]

11:19.946 --> 11:23.014
- Well, how does she think
we got the kids?

11:23.016 --> 11:25.784
- I meant before.
You know, before we got married.

11:25.786 --> 11:27.419
[laughs]

11:29.455 --> 11:32.857
[laughs]

11:32.859 --> 11:36.695
- You can stop
laughing now, ray.

11:36.697 --> 11:38.963
- I don't want to.

11:45.438 --> 11:48.206
- Hi.
- What, you get lost?

11:48.208 --> 11:49.407
I'm starving here!

11:49.409 --> 11:51.176
- The babysitter
just got there.

11:51.178 --> 11:53.011
- Yeah, yeah.
Let's get going.

11:53.013 --> 11:55.013
Appetizers, marie

11:55.015 --> 11:58.283
- Welcome to
la cucina dell' amy.

11:58.285 --> 12:00.051
May I take your coats?

12:00.053 --> 12:01.720
- I got it, robert.

12:01.722 --> 12:04.189
- Hi, raymond.
- Hi.

12:04.191 --> 12:06.357
- Oh, debra.

12:06.359 --> 12:09.294
Oh.

12:09.296 --> 12:11.429
I'm so glad you're here.

12:11.431 --> 12:12.964
Oh, come on. Come on.
Come on.

12:12.966 --> 12:15.066
I need your opinion
on this sauce.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.769
- Really?
- Yes, of course.

12:19.472 --> 12:20.939
- Mmm.
Yeah, tastes good.

12:20.941 --> 12:22.040
- Good.

12:22.042 --> 12:23.041
- What's your secret?

12:23.043 --> 12:24.809
Extra-virgin olive oil?

12:26.912 --> 12:27.911
- All right now,

12:27.913 --> 12:30.415
You boys take the appetizers
and get out of here now.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.083
And let us finish in here.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.251
- Okay.
All right.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.252
Come on, debra.
Let's go.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.252
- No, no, no, no.

12:35.254 --> 12:39.991
I want debra to stay
and help me with the salad.

12:39.993 --> 12:42.093
- Love your haircut, deb.
- Oh, thanks.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.028
- Oh, yeah,
it's very good.

12:44.030 --> 12:47.398
- Oh, well, you know me,
good hair for a good girl.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.834
[chuckles]

12:49.836 --> 12:52.804
Yeah, want to look good,
want to be good.

12:52.806 --> 12:54.339
Good, good, good.

12:54.341 --> 12:56.775
- Okay, let's get going.

12:56.777 --> 12:58.409
Let's let amy and mom
finish up here.

12:58.411 --> 12:59.878
- No, no, no.
Let--

12:59.880 --> 13:01.146
- No, no, it's amy's dinner,
you know,

13:01.148 --> 13:04.516
And we wouldn't want
to ruin it.

13:04.518 --> 13:07.152
- Are you happy now?
- No.

13:07.154 --> 13:08.787
- Why?
Your mom likes me.

13:08.789 --> 13:12.957
- I'm sorry.

13:12.959 --> 13:15.093
- Hey, ray, try one
of these garlic rounds.

13:15.095 --> 13:17.428
Amy made them.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.798
- Okay, dinner will be ready
in just a few minutes.

13:19.800 --> 13:20.799
- Thank god!

13:20.801 --> 13:24.469
- Isn't this fun?
[giggling]

13:24.471 --> 13:25.469
You know what, debra?

13:25.471 --> 13:27.372
You and I
should make a big meal

13:27.374 --> 13:29.240
For the family together.

13:29.242 --> 13:30.341
How long has it been?

13:30.343 --> 13:31.810
- Oh, gosh, pretty long.

13:31.812 --> 13:34.379
Let's see,
uh, never.

13:34.381 --> 13:35.380
- No!
[laughs]

13:35.382 --> 13:37.348
No.

13:37.350 --> 13:38.550
Never?
- No.

13:38.552 --> 13:39.918
- Oh, we'll just
have to do it.

13:39.920 --> 13:40.952
- Oh, that's okay.

13:40.954 --> 13:42.453
- No, we'll have lots of fun.

13:42.455 --> 13:44.589
- That's okay, marie.
- Oh, you know what?

13:44.591 --> 13:47.091
You can make
your lemon chicken.

13:47.093 --> 13:48.091
I love that.

13:48.093 --> 13:50.228
- All right, stop it, ma, huh?
Just stop it.

13:50.230 --> 13:51.462
- What?

13:51.464 --> 13:53.231
- Stop being nice to debra.

13:53.233 --> 13:55.333
- Ugh.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.368
Don't bother, ray.
- No, this is crazy.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.370
She can't keep
treating you like this.

13:59.372 --> 14:00.972
- I shouldn't be nice?

14:00.974 --> 14:02.440
- You're being nice
for the wrong reasons!

14:02.442 --> 14:04.909
You know she can't cook.

14:08.280 --> 14:10.014
And what I said
about debra?

14:10.016 --> 14:12.350
I lied, okay?
I lied!

14:12.352 --> 14:13.885
- What do you mean?

14:13.887 --> 14:15.920
- Debra wasn't a good girl
when we got married.

14:15.922 --> 14:18.323
- Oh!
- Huh?

14:18.325 --> 14:20.024
- What do you mean,
a good girl?

14:20.026 --> 14:22.460
- Go ahead, ray.
Tell him.

14:22.462 --> 14:25.096
- Oh, you weren't a good girl.

14:25.098 --> 14:27.398
[laughs]
got ya.

14:27.400 --> 14:32.904
So who cares about the cooking?

14:32.906 --> 14:35.440
- Why would you lie
to me, raymond?

14:35.442 --> 14:37.442
- Because of you.
You.

14:37.444 --> 14:40.311
You care so much about
who's a good girl and who's not.

14:40.313 --> 14:41.579
You started
this whole competition

14:41.581 --> 14:43.281
Between debra and amy.

14:43.283 --> 14:44.449
- Here we go.

14:46.285 --> 14:48.152
What competition?

14:48.154 --> 14:50.889
- [clears throat]
don't worry. You win.

14:53.292 --> 14:56.961
- And if I'm
following this right, you lose.

15:02.568 --> 15:04.502
- What are you guys
talking about?

15:04.504 --> 15:06.504
- You weren't supposed
to say anything.

15:06.506 --> 15:08.039
- That's why
you like amy better,

15:08.041 --> 15:10.141
'cause she hasn't been
around the block?

15:10.143 --> 15:11.542
Why didn't you
tell me that?

15:11.544 --> 15:16.147
- It was a secret, frank!

15:16.149 --> 15:17.415
- Yes.

15:17.417 --> 15:21.219
It was a secret.

15:21.221 --> 15:25.023
- Amy, what did you
tell marie that for?

15:25.025 --> 15:28.393
- I didn't tell marie.
- Well, I didn't tell her.

15:28.395 --> 15:29.694
- Robert?

15:36.335 --> 15:37.368
- I'm sorry.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.971
I haven't been paying attention.

15:47.046 --> 15:49.013
- All right,
let me fill you in.

15:49.015 --> 15:51.683
We just found out
that you told ma--

15:51.685 --> 15:55.954
- Okay, raymond.
I'm up to speed.

15:55.956 --> 15:57.422
- How come you told
your mother about amy?

15:57.424 --> 16:00.425
You didn't tell me.
- You didn't ask.

16:00.427 --> 16:02.060
- You asked?

16:02.062 --> 16:04.529
- I care about people.

16:04.531 --> 16:06.731
- Marie, why would you
ask that about me?

16:06.733 --> 16:09.334
- Uh, you know,
I can explain it.

16:09.336 --> 16:11.269
Run.

16:11.271 --> 16:14.672
Just run, and keep running.

16:14.674 --> 16:17.675
- Robert, why would you
tell your mother that?

16:17.677 --> 16:19.177
- So she'd like you better.

16:19.179 --> 16:20.211
- You're worse.

16:20.213 --> 16:22.413
You lied so she'd
like me better.

16:22.415 --> 16:26.050
- A lie of love.

16:26.052 --> 16:28.252
- Oh, god, I keep forgetting

16:28.254 --> 16:30.188
What a freak show
this family is

16:30.190 --> 16:32.757
Until somebody new comes in
and looks at us like that.

16:39.064 --> 16:41.566
I remember that look.

16:41.568 --> 16:44.135
That used to be me.

16:44.137 --> 16:47.772
And now I'm one of them.

16:47.774 --> 16:49.674
- I take exception
to that, debra.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.609
- Well, I take exception
to what you think, marie.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.277
You think just because
you were a good girl

16:53.279 --> 16:54.612
In the '50s,
that gives you the right--

16:54.614 --> 16:56.381
- Good girl?
Ha!

16:56.383 --> 16:57.782
- Oh, frank, no!

16:57.784 --> 16:59.217
- Oh, god.

16:59.219 --> 17:02.120
- What the hell
are you talking about?

17:04.623 --> 17:07.291
- Is that true, marie?

17:07.293 --> 17:10.094
- [stammering]

17:13.065 --> 17:14.632
- Go ahead, marie.

17:14.634 --> 17:17.201
I won't tell anyone.

17:20.672 --> 17:23.775
- Okay!
Yes!

17:33.819 --> 17:38.189
Frank and I succumbed
to temptation once,

17:38.191 --> 17:40.625
Just once
before we were married.

17:40.627 --> 17:43.327
I was weak,

17:43.329 --> 17:47.398
And I fell for your father's
boyish good looks.

17:50.469 --> 17:52.270
That was a long time ago.

17:55.441 --> 17:56.808
I knew it.

17:56.810 --> 17:58.676
I knew we shouldn't do
what we did,

17:58.678 --> 18:01.612
But we were in love,
right, frank?

18:01.614 --> 18:04.182
- I wanted sex.

18:10.556 --> 18:12.757
It was a long time ago.

18:16.128 --> 18:18.696
- So it was just the once,
and then you got married?

18:18.698 --> 18:20.665
- It was just the once,
and then we had to get married!

18:20.667 --> 18:24.168
- Frank, no!

18:24.170 --> 18:27.839
- Oh, whoa.
Had to get married?

18:27.841 --> 18:29.574
Wait.
Wait a minute.

18:29.576 --> 18:32.410
So robert's--

18:32.412 --> 18:36.414
- What?

18:36.416 --> 18:40.518
Oh.

18:40.520 --> 18:43.855
- All right.
It's true.

18:43.857 --> 18:46.891
We got married

18:46.893 --> 18:50.294
After I found out
I was pregnant.

18:50.296 --> 18:54.532
And then robbie came along
seven months later.

18:54.534 --> 19:00.171
- Our plan was to tell people
he was two months premature.

19:00.173 --> 19:02.140
Then he was born.

19:02.142 --> 19:05.810
Try passing off a 12-pound baby
as premature.

19:11.583 --> 19:15.786
- Try passing it, period.

19:15.788 --> 19:17.355
- All right.
Wait a minute.

19:17.357 --> 19:20.658
Wait, it's nine months, right?

19:20.660 --> 19:23.928
You were married in September,
and my birthday's in June.

19:23.930 --> 19:26.731
- That's when we told you
your birthday was.

19:26.733 --> 19:28.799
- What?

19:28.801 --> 19:30.201
- It was--

19:30.203 --> 19:31.936
It was easier
that way, robbie.

19:31.938 --> 19:35.573
- Oh, well, as long
as it was easy!

19:38.577 --> 19:40.478
Well, there you go, raymond.

19:40.480 --> 19:44.415
You were conceived legitimately.

19:44.417 --> 19:48.452
You win again.

19:48.454 --> 19:51.289
- Come on, robert, what?
There's no winning.

19:58.797 --> 20:01.365
- Well, I guess I should know.

20:01.367 --> 20:02.934
When is my real birthday?

20:02.936 --> 20:06.370
- April 6th.

20:06.372 --> 20:07.972
- That's today.

20:11.877 --> 20:14.545
- Surprise.

20:25.390 --> 20:31.862
[singing quietly]
happy birthday to you

20:31.864 --> 20:37.435
All: Happy birthday to you

20:37.437 --> 20:43.774
Happy birthday, dear robert

20:43.776 --> 20:49.380
Happy birthday to you

20:49.382 --> 20:51.015
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday, honey.

20:51.017 --> 20:52.016
- Happy birthday.

20:52.018 --> 20:55.319
- [singing]
how old am I now?
