nah, nah, nah.
I'm grown.

10:50.524 --> 10:51.650
-Molly: Oh!
-I got this.

10:51.734 --> 10:54.487
-Well, let's fuckin' go!
-Watch me work.

10:54.570 --> 10:55.863
(Issa chuckles)

10:55.946 --> 10:58.115
Kelli:
She woke up
and chose confidence.

10:58.199 --> 11:00.117
All right, girl,
you gonna have
to wing her solo.

11:00.201 --> 11:01.619
The white man got me
on a deadline.

11:01.702 --> 11:05.081
-I done told you.
-Okay, why are we
beating a dead horse?

11:05.164 --> 11:06.582
I told you I'd
think about it.

11:06.665 --> 11:08.084
All I'm sayin' is
I talked to the partners

11:08.167 --> 11:11.379
about having
an estate division,
and they are down for it.

11:12.963 --> 11:16.384
-Okay, okay.
I'll call you tomorrow.
-All right.

11:16.467 --> 11:17.927
Hey, do one of y'all
have a Shout wipe?

11:18.010 --> 11:20.721
'Cause I accidentally
spit red wine on his shirt.

11:20.805 --> 11:21.722
(chuckles)

11:22.431 --> 11:24.058
What? I'm rusty.

11:24.934 --> 11:26.185
Um...

11:33.984 --> 11:36.362
-You came.
-Yeah, yeah.

11:36.445 --> 11:39.740
I still get the, you know,
BLOCC's email chain, so...

11:39.824 --> 11:40.991
Oh, right.

11:42.410 --> 11:46.205
It's just--
I, uh, hadn't
heard from you.

11:46.288 --> 11:48.791
I know...
I got your messages.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.252
I just, um--

11:53.212 --> 11:57.716
I forgot, uh, this is
from everybody at the shop.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.553
I just--
We wanted to donate
'cause you was

12:00.636 --> 12:02.471
so helpful to us, so...

12:04.432 --> 12:07.101
-Tell 'em I said thank you.
-I will.

12:08.102 --> 12:10.646
How have things
been with you?

12:11.605 --> 12:15.901
Good... Things have
been good, yeah.

12:15.985 --> 12:18.571
This place is
finally startin'
to feel like home.

12:19.655 --> 12:20.739
Really?

12:22.032 --> 12:23.117
That's--

12:24.994 --> 12:27.329
I'm really happy
to hear that.

12:28.747 --> 12:29.665
Yeah.

12:32.001 --> 12:34.670
Look, last time we talked,
I know I said some things--

12:34.753 --> 12:36.547
No... um...

12:37.840 --> 12:40.968
-You made some points.
-I was just hurt.

12:43.053 --> 12:44.221
You know?

12:47.725 --> 12:49.560
You know,
I've always thought that

12:49.643 --> 12:52.146
people come into
your life for a reason,

12:52.229 --> 12:54.648
and you have made up...

12:54.732 --> 12:58.736
so many good reasons for me,
and I hope that...

12:58.819 --> 13:01.530
that I did the same for you
'cause I don't want...

13:03.491 --> 13:05.367
I don't want you
to regret anything.

13:10.331 --> 13:11.665
I don't.

13:16.754 --> 13:19.423
-Anyway--
-(both laughing)

13:19.507 --> 13:22.384
I just--
I wanted to stop through.

13:23.719 --> 13:25.137
Happy birthday.

13:26.555 --> 13:27.848
Thank you.

13:31.060 --> 13:33.020
Yeah, it was
good to see you.

13:33.103 --> 13:35.356
It was good
to see you, too,

13:35.439 --> 13:36.565
Nanceford.

13:37.942 --> 13:39.693

13:56.544 --> 13:58.712

13:58.796 --> 14:00.381

-Oh.

14:01.257 --> 14:03.467
Hey, how you doin'?

14:03.551 --> 14:05.469
How you doin'?
Nice to meet you.

14:05.553 --> 14:06.887
-What's your name?
-I'm Issa.

14:20.526 --> 14:22.611
-this is beautiful.
-Issa: Right?

14:22.695 --> 14:24.405
Y'all are really
whole-ass homeowners.

14:24.488 --> 14:26.574
-Wow.
-That's what I keep
tellin' myself.

14:26.657 --> 14:28.325
I mean, I still ain't
rollin' with it, but...

14:28.409 --> 14:30.411
you know, this is a lot
of space for my god-baby.

14:30.494 --> 14:33.872
Also, Denver do
have that sticky-icky,
so I ain't mad at it.

14:33.956 --> 14:37.585
(laughs)
Right? That's why they
call it the Mile-High City.

14:39.211 --> 14:40.462
You couldn't let
me have that?

14:40.546 --> 14:41.463
No, 'cause if
I give you that one,

14:41.547 --> 14:42.631
then I gotta give
you the next one.

14:42.715 --> 14:43.716
Can I get
the fourth one?

14:43.799 --> 14:44.842
I'll think about it.

14:47.595 --> 14:50.514

What's goin' on, girl?

14:50.598 --> 14:52.308
I'm just--
I'm so glad
you guys came.

14:52.391 --> 14:55.019
I fucking hate it here.

14:55.102 --> 14:57.271
I mean,
I don't know anybody,
I'm still not working.

14:57.354 --> 14:59.690
I just didn't sign up to be
a Real Housewife of Denver.

14:59.773 --> 15:01.609
Well, what about
Derek's family?

15:01.692 --> 15:02.776
Aren't they
comin' around?

15:02.860 --> 15:05.029
The novelty of Simone
wore off pretty quick.

15:05.112 --> 15:06.447
Now it's more just like,

15:06.530 --> 15:08.782
"Oh, we love her.
Come and get
our grandbaby."

15:08.866 --> 15:10.409
But what about
that preschool
you all liked?

15:10.492 --> 15:12.494
-Is it workin' out?
-It's fine.

15:12.578 --> 15:15.247
Except for the fact
that she's the only
Black girl in her class.

15:16.707 --> 15:19.001
We'll figure it out.

15:19.084 --> 15:20.878
You will.
You definitely will.

15:20.961 --> 15:22.171
Molly: Yeah, girl.

15:22.254 --> 15:23.339
You know what?

15:23.422 --> 15:25.090
Let me stop bein' a drag.

15:25.174 --> 15:27.176
Spill the tea.
What have I been missin'?

15:28.927 --> 15:30.679
-Issa met somebody.
-Ooh.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.973
Stop, it is
not like that.

15:33.057 --> 15:34.350
I got way too much goin' on.

15:34.433 --> 15:35.726
Mm-mm.
Show her the picture.

15:35.809 --> 15:37.227
-Kelli and Molly: Bring 'em out.
-Y'all so extra.

15:37.311 --> 15:39.938
He got a good dick,
and good job, too.

15:40.022 --> 15:41.148
(laughs)

15:41.231 --> 15:42.691
(gasps)
He's cute.

15:42.775 --> 15:43.942
-Mm-hm.
-He cool.

15:44.026 --> 15:46.320
He a giver,
and I'm a taker,
so (laughs).

15:46.403 --> 15:49.114
-Hi.
-(all greet Simone)

15:49.198 --> 15:52.284
-Kelli: That's my girl.
-Happy birthday, Mommy.

15:52.368 --> 15:53.369
All:
Aww.

15:53.452 --> 15:55.454
Aight, save some room
for dessert, ladies.

15:55.537 --> 15:56.580
Yes!

15:56.664 --> 15:58.415
So dope
y'all came out.

15:58.499 --> 16:01.043
None of my L.A. niggas
have come visit me.

16:01.126 --> 16:02.127

16:06.131 --> 16:08.717
-You still at it?
-Yeah, girl.

16:10.761 --> 16:12.596
You think Tiffany's
feeling better?

16:12.680 --> 16:14.264
I hope so.

16:14.348 --> 16:16.642
I wanna tell her
to give it time, but...

16:16.725 --> 16:19.353
that just feels like
a thing that people say.

16:19.436 --> 16:20.729
Nah, I think
that's right.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.856
I'm really glad we all
made it out, though.

16:22.940 --> 16:25.150
You know, I know
we're all busy,
but we did it!

16:25.234 --> 16:27.653
-Yeah, I'm proud of us.
-(Issa laughs)

16:27.736 --> 16:29.446
Highkey, I think
we all needed this.

16:29.530 --> 16:30.531
Mm-hm.

I've always wondered?

17:02.020 --> 17:03.355
What?

17:05.190 --> 17:06.817
What would you
have said to Lawrence

17:06.900 --> 17:08.485
if Nathan hadn't
interrupted?

17:10.821 --> 17:12.781
I don't know.

17:12.865 --> 17:15.409
-You really don't know?
-No, I don't.

Oh, it's Curtis.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.646
Tell him
I say hey!

I won't.

17:46.106 --> 17:48.150
Hey, bighead.

17:48.233 --> 17:50.319
Wait, slow down,
slow down, Curtis...

17:50.402 --> 17:52.321

you do today?

18:31.401 --> 18:32.778
Jah and I had
lunch with Condola,

18:32.861 --> 18:34.029
and she took him

18:50.420 --> 18:51.672
Hello?

18:52.840 --> 18:56.385
Oh, hey... you answered?

18:56.468 --> 18:58.303
Who answers on their birthday?

18:58.387 --> 19:01.223
You called me,
but didn't want
me to answer?

19:01.306 --> 19:03.892
The plan, admittedly,
had some holes.

19:03.976 --> 19:04.893
Yeah.

19:07.271 --> 19:08.689
You sound great...

19:08.772 --> 19:10.566
not that you
shouldn't sound great.

19:10.649 --> 19:12.693
You should sound
how you sound.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.445
Louis Armstrong is
the only person who

19:15.529 --> 19:17.698
shouldn't sound
how they sound.

19:17.781 --> 19:21.410
(Louis Armstrong voice):
What a wonderful world.

19:21.493 --> 19:23.579
That's pretty good.
I didn't even practice that.

19:32.170 --> 19:34.673
Uh, yeah, so, um...

19:36.383 --> 19:38.886
with everything
that's happened...

19:38.969 --> 19:40.929
I've been thinking a lot...

19:42.598 --> 19:44.016
about things...

19:46.602 --> 19:47.769
about you.

19:48.896 --> 19:50.731
And, uh...

19:50.814 --> 19:54.359
I didn't wanna let too
much time pass before...

19:57.321 --> 19:58.238

20:13.587 --> 20:16.089

did you two meet?

-A work event.

21:45.804 --> 21:47.597
I, I had seen
him on an app--

21:47.681 --> 21:49.975

at the Pyer Moss show.

You know,
the Crenshawn
collaboration?

21:52.060 --> 21:54.688

I think she thought
she knew me, so--

21:54.771 --> 21:57.024
I had thought I did.
I did.

21:58.108 --> 21:59.901
Um... so how'd
y'all meet again?

-(clinking glass)
-Everybody, my baby
got an announcement.

22:04.156 --> 22:05.824
First of all,
I just wanna
thank everyone

22:05.907 --> 22:07.743
for coming to celebrate
me for my birthday.

22:07.826 --> 22:11.455
You all are some of the most
important people in my life...

22:11.538 --> 22:13.331

have another...

22:13.415 --> 22:16.084

person in our lives.

Y'all, I love
this woman so much.

22:19.546 --> 22:21.006
And just so y'all know,
I would not,

22:21.089 --> 22:23.925
under any circumstances,
do this with anybody else--

22:24.009 --> 22:25.427

you didn't want kids.

23:00.170 --> 23:01.546
And then, I realized...

23:01.630 --> 23:04.382
I don't want just
any nigga's kids.

23:04.466 --> 23:06.885
I want this nigga's kids.

23:06.968 --> 23:09.429

really beautiful.

thought I would do.
